<font color=1275ef>(MARIE-CURIE FORTUNE)</font>

01:45.053 --> 01:46.680
You may begin.

02:06.116 --> 02:09.744
Remember, give these straight to
your parents when you get home.

02:09.744 --> 02:12.372
Do not open them yourselves.

02:12.414 --> 02:15.125
Albert-Einstein Cole.

02:17.127 --> 02:19.754
Nicola-Tesla Hertz.

02:21.464 --> 02:24.008
Marie-Curie Fortune.

02:24.050 --> 02:25.426
Thank you.

02:34.143 --> 02:36.896
Theodor-Adorno Strauss.

02:38.189 --> 02:39.357
What did you get?

02:41.985 --> 02:45.613
- 127.
- Don't go higher than 100.

02:46.322 --> 02:47.699
Hey!

02:53.621 --> 02:56.499
I only got a 67, but...

02:56.791 --> 03:00.753
I'm so Relieved, really.
It could have been so much lower.

03:00.962 --> 03:04.173
- Meet my friend.
- You don't have any friends.

03:05.341 --> 03:07.385
This is Isaac-Newton Midgeley.

03:07.468 --> 03:10.388
- Zak. Hello.
- Hello.

03:10.596 --> 03:13.307
He's... minus seven.

03:13.391 --> 03:15.184
Always knew I didn't like you.

03:15.268 --> 03:18.396
- Thought he was your friend.
- Shut up and wait.

03:18.813 --> 03:20.064
What for?

03:22.024 --> 03:25.903
Super-High frequency meets
Super-Low frequency.

03:26.529 --> 03:28.447
So that should be happening,

03:28.531 --> 03:30.533
some... reaction.

04:03.190 --> 04:04.525
Interesting.

04:07.569 --> 04:10.239
Come on in, Zak.
Your mother's here.

04:12.408 --> 04:14.910
- Now, Zak!
- Coming, Mrs. Cook.

04:17.245 --> 04:18.579
How long?

04:22.501 --> 04:24.753
Exactly one minute.

04:39.768 --> 04:42.020
- Daughter.
- Father.

04:54.533 --> 04:55.700
So...

04:58.411 --> 04:59.955
You know what this means.

05:00.664 --> 05:03.583
How it will change your life?

05:04.501 --> 05:05.961
Yes.

05:07.462 --> 05:09.422
How do you feel about it?

05:13.301 --> 05:16.096
I'm so relieved, really.

05:16.137 --> 05:19.265
It could have been so much lower.

05:26.189 --> 05:31.027
<font color=cyan>(Knowledge determines destiny)</font>

05:31.027 --> 05:34.030
Obviously, this is great news,
and we're very keen...

05:34.072 --> 05:37.283
to make sure that Marie
fulfills her potential.

05:37.534 --> 05:40.161
Is that not guaranteed, now?

05:41.287 --> 05:44.249
Is there anything we can do
about her emotional--

05:44.958 --> 05:46.960
Her emotions?

05:49.003 --> 05:51.047
It's a common side effect.

05:51.339 --> 05:54.550
The higher the frequency,
the lower the empathy.

05:54.676 --> 05:57.387
One tends to drive out the other.

05:57.679 --> 06:00.223
The luckier we are,
the less we care about it.

06:00.306 --> 06:02.433
And no one's going to be
luckier than Marie.

06:02.475 --> 06:04.644
No, it doesn't appear so.

06:04.811 --> 06:09.816
There are certain things we can try--
Knowledge does determine destiny, after all.

06:09.857 --> 06:12.527
I don't want her to be an experiment.

06:12.860 --> 06:15.196
We want her to...

06:15.279 --> 06:16.697
make friends,

06:16.781 --> 06:18.533
have fun,

06:18.741 --> 06:20.451
fall in love,

06:21.202 --> 06:23.287
have a normal life.

06:23.829 --> 06:24.872
Oh!

06:25.247 --> 06:27.833
I'm sorry, but you must understand...

06:27.959 --> 06:29.835
that won't be at all possible.

06:31.045 --> 06:34.006
If you want to find true love,
stop here.

06:34.465 --> 06:37.385
If you want to find true love,
stop here.

06:37.927 --> 06:40.721
If you want to find true love,
stop here.

06:41.430 --> 06:44.183
If you want to find true love,
stop here.

06:44.642 --> 06:47.394
- Hello, Miss. Anderson.
- Hello, Marie.

06:48.229 --> 06:49.688
If you want to find true love--

06:49.772 --> 06:52.149
Well, I've stopped.

06:54.318 --> 06:56.737
This analyzes your precise frequency.

06:56.820 --> 06:59.573
I developed a way
to directly read the waveform--

06:59.615 --> 07:01.659
much more efficient
than the old school test.

07:01.742 --> 07:04.536
- You have the patent for that?
- Of course.

07:04.954 --> 07:08.666
It's now cross-referencing men
and women with compatible resonance.

07:08.791 --> 07:10.376
Only a small sample--

07:10.584 --> 07:13.462
Just the teachers that would let me
take their reading this morning.

07:13.462 --> 07:15.839
That's how you define true love?

07:15.881 --> 07:17.591
That's how nature defines it.

07:17.841 --> 07:21.553
Those with the lower frequencies
need a minimum of 700 signifiers.

07:21.595 --> 07:25.140
Of course, there are natural forces
to repel, not attract.

07:25.224 --> 07:27.184
What are your plans for this project?

07:27.351 --> 07:29.686
Father wants to put it on the market.

07:30.062 --> 07:33.106
Apparently, people are obsessed
about finding true love.

07:34.816 --> 07:37.945
And you?

07:40.697 --> 07:44.159
No one 100 percents,
but there is a 95.

07:45.369 --> 07:46.995
And who is that?

07:48.872 --> 07:50.415
Mr. Thales.

07:53.001 --> 07:54.377
Really?!

07:54.795 --> 07:57.089
Maybe you should go and say hello.

07:57.130 --> 07:59.466
All extra data is useful.

08:01.510 --> 08:05.680
This... device
has many possible applications...

08:05.972 --> 08:08.683
- such as the ability to find friends.
- Of course.

08:08.683 --> 08:13.146
- Just a different set of signifiers.
- And have you tested this aspect yourself?

08:18.526 --> 08:19.694
No.

08:19.819 --> 08:21.655
Everybody wants to be my friend.

08:21.696 --> 08:24.324
But how many actually
are your friends?

08:26.534 --> 08:27.619
None.

08:27.786 --> 08:30.663
Then I believe it is necessary
for you to give it a try.

08:30.872 --> 08:33.332
All extra data is useful.

08:45.929 --> 08:49.098
<font color=cyan>(Experiment 1)</font>

08:49.098 --> 08:51.809
Sorry I'm late.
Got locked in a corridor.

08:52.727 --> 08:54.062
Interesting.

09:02.195 --> 09:03.821
- Hello.
- Hello.

09:03.988 --> 09:05.490
- Did you see the--
- I was going to say...

09:05.490 --> 09:08.159
- Yes.
- ...we don't have to speak.

09:11.412 --> 09:13.164
It's just that-- I want to.
I mean,

09:13.206 --> 09:15.750
We're probably not gonna
get more than a minute.

09:17.084 --> 09:18.211
Sorry...

09:18.586 --> 09:21.005
- How are you?
- Greeting or serious question?

09:21.088 --> 09:23.716
- Greeting.
- Fine. How are you?

09:23.799 --> 09:25.426
Bit worried about
what's going to happen.

09:25.426 --> 09:26.677
Maybe nothing will happen.

09:26.719 --> 09:29.722
If that's true, then...
why are they here?

09:32.183 --> 09:33.976
Why don't you ask them?

09:35.394 --> 09:36.354
Why me?

09:36.354 --> 09:40.524
Because you and I supposed to
have the most interesting reaction.

09:42.151 --> 09:43.444
How long?

09:45.696 --> 09:49.450
- 50 seconds.
- What happens if it goes past a minute?

10:10.012 --> 10:12.890
Detention, both of you.

10:14.141 --> 10:15.601
- Separately.
- It's okay.

10:15.642 --> 10:17.561
They've used up their minute
for this year already.

10:17.603 --> 10:19.646
We couldn't get them together
now if we tried.

10:19.813 --> 10:20.814
Why do it?

10:20.856 --> 10:23.150
You know what happens
when you two get together.

10:23.317 --> 10:25.068
You want to put Zak in danger?

10:25.068 --> 10:28.322
This is a health-and-safety issue
for the whole school.

10:28.405 --> 10:29.823
Come on.

10:34.453 --> 10:36.413
- Do you like him?
- It's just an experiment.

10:36.413 --> 10:40.626
It's a false experiment.
Frequency does not change.

10:43.545 --> 10:47.341
Don't waste your...
feelings on this boy.

10:47.799 --> 10:51.803
The two of you are just
not destined to be together.

10:52.763 --> 10:55.807
Knowledge determines destiny,
Miss. Anderson.

11:07.777 --> 11:11.448
<font color=cyan>(Experiment 2)</font>

11:15.952 --> 11:16.953
Hello.

11:16.995 --> 11:18.246
Hello.

11:20.957 --> 11:24.127
If it goes past a minute,
maybe frequency isn't fixed.

11:24.169 --> 11:25.253
Sorry?

11:25.545 --> 11:28.673
You asked what would happen
if it goes past a minute.

11:29.466 --> 11:31.176
I've decided we should talk.

11:31.426 --> 11:32.677
Did anyone see you?

11:32.719 --> 11:34.512
No, I don't think so.

11:40.351 --> 11:42.228
Good. We're alone.

11:43.146 --> 11:45.482
Less chance of something happening.

11:46.107 --> 11:47.358
How are you?

11:48.943 --> 11:50.778
Not so good, actually.

11:50.987 --> 11:53.156
I think I've got the flu.

11:53.740 --> 11:55.700
I need a more specific answer.

11:55.742 --> 11:58.995
Imagine your physical state
and emotions to my research.

11:59.078 --> 12:00.580
I thought you might be.

12:00.663 --> 12:03.416
Well, I'm feeling...

12:03.791 --> 12:05.418
tense,

12:05.460 --> 12:07.211
nervous,

12:07.295 --> 12:09.005
breathless...

12:09.213 --> 12:10.381
sweaty.

12:10.423 --> 12:12.341
Because you're worried about
what might happen?

12:12.383 --> 12:14.177
That's part of it.

12:14.177 --> 12:16.095
Are you okay?

12:16.471 --> 12:18.181
Fine.

12:18.973 --> 12:20.600
I've got an idea.

12:57.428 --> 13:00.639
<font color=cyan>(Experiment 3)</font>

13:02.850 --> 13:05.144
- Hello.
- Hello.

13:10.816 --> 13:14.403
- What was your idea?
- I think we should... touch.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.905
You know,
as part of the data collection.

13:16.947 --> 13:18.574
I think we should touch.

13:21.327 --> 13:22.661
I can't.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.748
- Why not?
- Because it changes the variables.

13:25.789 --> 13:29.835
- We haven't touched, so--
- We should never touch?

13:30.169 --> 13:32.546
- Yes.
- It could be a new experiment,

13:32.671 --> 13:35.757
- A better experiment.
- What are you talking about?

13:37.718 --> 13:40.679
- Would you--
- It's not that I don't want to touch.

13:44.308 --> 13:47.269
What if it wasn't
just for data collection?

13:47.936 --> 13:49.521
What do you mean?

14:02.868 --> 14:04.786
I've got to ask you something.

14:04.995 --> 14:07.122
Yes?

14:10.584 --> 14:13.211
<font color=cyan>(Experiment 4)</font>

14:20.343 --> 14:22.721
- Hello.
- Hello.

14:26.850 --> 14:28.977
Will you go to graduation with me?

14:29.185 --> 14:30.812
Graduation's not till next year.

14:30.854 --> 14:33.356
I don't get many opportunities to ask.

14:34.733 --> 14:36.526
We're supposed to be
keeping this quiet.

14:36.526 --> 14:39.362
But this isn't data collection.

14:39.654 --> 14:42.365
- This is a date.
- A one-minute date?

14:42.449 --> 14:44.451
I've been on shorter ones before.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.578
Low frequency, remember?

14:53.001 --> 14:54.669
- Yes.
- Yes?

15:05.054 --> 15:08.016
I think we should touch then, as well.
Think about it.

15:20.528 --> 15:23.239
<font color=cyan>(Experiment 5)</font>

15:27.034 --> 15:29.912
- Hello.
- Hello.

15:31.873 --> 15:33.666
Where do you want to touch me?

15:34.041 --> 15:35.126
Everywhere.

15:35.877 --> 15:37.837
Sorry, that sounds a bit wrong.

15:38.296 --> 15:42.300
I know we can't be together,
but... I need to tell you...

15:43.467 --> 15:44.927
I love you.

15:47.888 --> 15:49.890
I know you probably
don't love me, but I just...

15:49.890 --> 15:53.019
hope that you like me, you know?

15:53.519 --> 15:55.354
Serious question?

15:55.646 --> 15:56.772
Yes.

15:56.814 --> 15:58.065
No.

15:59.733 --> 16:01.277
What about our meetings?

16:01.318 --> 16:03.863
- Data collection.
- Just data collection?

16:03.946 --> 16:07.908
No, I've also been
experimenting with flirting.

16:08.117 --> 16:09.577
And now I've stopped.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.829
You really don't feel anything for me?

16:11.829 --> 16:14.415
I don't think you understand, Zak.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.375
I don't feel.

16:17.126 --> 16:19.795
No one wants to understand.

16:20.129 --> 16:22.047
I know what they call me.

16:22.047 --> 16:23.674
The Machine.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.926
And they're right.

16:26.010 --> 16:28.554
I do not love my family.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.515
I experience no joy.

16:31.682 --> 16:34.893
If you ever see me smile,
frown, laugh or cry,

16:35.060 --> 16:37.187
I'm pretending...

16:37.688 --> 16:40.858
waiting for it to become real.

16:41.358 --> 16:42.943
But it never will.

16:43.735 --> 16:45.571
It's the side effect.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.156
The side effect. Of course.

16:49.241 --> 16:53.203
The two of us are just not
destined to be together.

16:57.040 --> 17:00.627
Well, look at that.
One minute.

17:01.169 --> 17:03.338
Looks like I'm leaving right on time.

18:37.306 --> 18:38.349
Hello.

18:41.102 --> 18:45.356
It's not due in for another week, but
I'll just go check for you, okay?

18:48.234 --> 18:50.194
Would you look at that--
It's Just arrived.

18:50.361 --> 18:52.780
That'll be 20 pounds exactly, please.

18:54.657 --> 18:56.993
- Isn't that lucky?
- Isn't it?

19:41.245 --> 19:42.955
Surprise!

19:42.996 --> 19:45.082
Happy birthday, Marie.

19:58.887 --> 20:00.347
Hello.

20:02.849 --> 20:03.934
Hello.

20:04.643 --> 20:05.727
Zak.

20:06.061 --> 20:07.688
It's been a long time.

20:09.690 --> 20:11.108
Where did you get to?

20:11.608 --> 20:13.610
Everywhere. Sao Paulo,

20:13.694 --> 20:16.947
Buenos Aires, Kaichi, Kinshasa,

20:16.988 --> 20:18.740
But most recently, Vilnius.

20:18.740 --> 20:21.284
I can now curse convincingly
in 18 languages.

20:21.409 --> 20:24.121
Where's Kaichi?
I've not heard of it.

20:24.412 --> 20:27.624
Relax.
You don't have to pretend to care.

20:32.546 --> 20:34.839
- How are you?
- Greeting or serious question?

20:34.881 --> 20:37.926
- Serious question.
- Still the machine.

20:38.093 --> 20:39.928
- Still broken.
- Still waiting?

20:40.220 --> 20:42.681
Waiting, pretending,

20:42.681 --> 20:44.933
but now, I think, so is everyone else.

20:51.189 --> 20:54.526
- Why are you here?
- To continue the experiment, of course.

20:54.692 --> 20:56.945
- Nothing's changed.
- Not for you.

20:56.986 --> 21:01.032
- What's changed for you, Zak?
- Look at your watch.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.703
Over a minute.

21:07.914 --> 21:09.415
I can't stay.

21:09.541 --> 21:12.710
But meet me in the train shop
tomorrow at 7:00.

21:12.961 --> 21:15.129
I think I can help you.

21:43.574 --> 21:45.117
Glad you could make it.

21:49.539 --> 21:52.541
- Expecting a call?
- Yes.

21:54.293 --> 21:55.962
How did you last more than a minute?

21:57.588 --> 21:59.382
I changed my frequency.

22:00.257 --> 22:01.676
You know that's not possible.

22:01.759 --> 22:03.219
Knowledge determines destiny.
I--

22:03.344 --> 22:05.721
You did this?

22:06.222 --> 22:08.724
- You found the solution?
- Yes.

22:09.266 --> 22:11.644
- Does that surprise you?
- Yes.

22:12.061 --> 22:13.646
You are Low-Frequency.

22:13.771 --> 22:15.231
Not anymore.

22:16.816 --> 22:19.360
What we know about frequency is wrong.

22:19.401 --> 22:22.071
Otherwise, you and I
would never have met.

22:23.113 --> 22:24.865
You said you could help me.

22:25.908 --> 22:27.409
I can change your frequency.

22:27.409 --> 22:29.620
- Lower it?
- I don't think it gets much higher.

22:29.662 --> 22:31.830
But nature works hard
to give me everything.

22:31.872 --> 22:33.540
Almost everything.

22:35.292 --> 22:37.127
Tell me the process.

22:39.338 --> 22:41.965
Okay, I don't think
you're gonna like it.

22:43.884 --> 22:46.512
Essentially, it's an energy exchange.
I'll be bringing you down...

22:46.553 --> 22:48.722
a lot closer to my level.

22:48.722 --> 22:51.183
There are a lot of processes
at work, but...

22:51.183 --> 22:54.436
one of them is... me... touching you.

22:54.853 --> 22:55.896
Clever.

22:55.938 --> 22:59.775
The negative feedback loop should
eventually be self-reinforcing, but...

22:59.775 --> 23:02.694
I will need to be physically
close to you for a while.

23:02.736 --> 23:04.321
Very clever.

23:05.072 --> 23:09.701
- How soon will I see results?
- If it works as I hope it should, instantly.

23:10.327 --> 23:11.995
You want to do it-- I can tell.

23:11.995 --> 23:13.622
Please don't lie.

23:13.789 --> 23:15.082
Vuren's sake.

23:15.123 --> 23:17.459
You will have feelings
for the first time in your life.

23:17.501 --> 23:18.960
Theoretically.

23:19.127 --> 23:20.670
Is it reversible?

23:21.296 --> 23:22.881
It should be.

23:23.507 --> 23:25.592
But there are no guarantee.

23:49.991 --> 23:51.326
That's it?

23:52.243 --> 23:55.413
The main part.
It might not work.

23:56.456 --> 23:58.833
I've decided you can talk
if you want.

23:59.125 --> 24:00.335
Thanks.

24:05.715 --> 24:09.344
It's weird, talking to you
without a deadline.

24:11.679 --> 24:13.848
Or... not talking.

24:20.396 --> 24:22.106
Are you okay?

24:22.482 --> 24:25.944
- I don't think I'm feeling very well.
- Feeling?

24:26.569 --> 24:29.781
Feeling physically sick
is not an emotion.

24:31.407 --> 24:35.119
But that's not this feeling.

25:19.580 --> 25:21.040
This is...

25:22.875 --> 25:24.293
This is it.

25:27.004 --> 25:30.341
This is... awful.

25:33.469 --> 25:36.680
- I feel a huge weight.
- I think that's just nerves.

25:37.598 --> 25:38.933
It's intense.

25:41.060 --> 25:44.647
I feel... connected to myself.

25:57.201 --> 25:59.787
- How does that feel?
- Not so good.

25:59.953 --> 26:03.874
It definitely feels better
when we're touching. Why is that?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.710
Because...

26:07.669 --> 26:09.338
Unith.

26:12.633 --> 26:14.051
You love me.

26:14.885 --> 26:16.261
Maybe.

26:19.056 --> 26:21.558
Where?
I think nature's rebelling.

26:21.558 --> 26:23.226
Just like old times.

26:23.310 --> 26:24.102
Should we do anything?

26:24.144 --> 26:27.189
No, it should settle down,
the longer we spend together.

26:32.486 --> 26:33.695
Eesa.

26:37.949 --> 26:40.327
- I know what I want to try.
- What?

26:40.452 --> 26:42.496
- Kiss me.
- Really?

26:42.621 --> 26:45.040
Don't make me ask again.
I'm used to getting what I want.

26:45.040 --> 26:46.458
I'm not.

26:48.210 --> 26:54.341
<font color=1275ef>(ISAAC-NEWTON MIDGELEY)</font>

27:23.328 --> 27:26.372
- I like her.
- You like everybody.

27:27.248 --> 27:28.541
She smiled at me.

27:29.375 --> 27:31.002
She smiles a lot.

27:34.505 --> 27:35.673
I think mine's wrong.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.845
Meet my friend.

27:41.471 --> 27:43.639
This is Isaac-Newton Midgeley.

27:44.265 --> 27:46.309
Zak. Hello.

27:48.853 --> 27:50.897
Obviously, this is not great news,

27:50.938 --> 27:53.274
and we cannot force
the choice upon you,

27:53.316 --> 27:56.444
but we are very
strongly recommending...

27:56.652 --> 28:02.116
that Zak be placed in a school better
suited to help him fulfill his potential.

28:02.241 --> 28:05.912
Because, according to you,
he has no potential.

28:07.705 --> 28:09.832
But a special school?

28:11.792 --> 28:13.919
Can nothing be done?

28:14.378 --> 28:16.672
I know that it is difficult,

28:16.797 --> 28:24.430
but you and Zak have to accept the fact
that he has abnormally Low-Frequency.

28:24.513 --> 28:26.515
So?
He'll be a little unlucky.

28:26.807 --> 28:29.810
Mrs. Midgeley,
we need to be clear on this.

28:30.186 --> 28:32.521
Zak is a negative.

28:32.897 --> 28:36.817
This is very rare, but it means
that he is literally...

28:36.901 --> 28:40.446
out of sync with the natural world.

28:40.446 --> 28:42.573
He will be beyond unlucky.

28:42.656 --> 28:46.201
He will never be in the right place
at the right time.

28:46.243 --> 28:51.332
He will never fit in,
apart from with those of his own kind.

28:51.623 --> 28:53.125
He no longer belongs here.

28:53.125 --> 28:55.961
That's not our opinion.
That's scientific fact.

28:55.961 --> 28:58.505
- He is gifted.
- He's a genius.

28:58.505 --> 29:01.967
But, unfortunately,
surrounded by prodigies.

29:02.176 --> 29:05.846
Perhaps we should ask Zak
what what he wants.

29:07.764 --> 29:12.561
Is this what you want, Zak?
Do you really want to stay here?

29:18.358 --> 29:22.029
- Yes.
- Good. Good boy.

29:24.406 --> 29:30.120
Now, you're going to need help,
so don't be afraid to ask for it.

29:31.538 --> 29:32.998
Okay?

29:33.832 --> 29:36.877
All knowledge that exists
is known in only two ways--

29:37.127 --> 29:39.296
Inductively and deductively.

29:39.796 --> 29:43.550
Inductive reasoning moves
from specific details and observations...

29:43.800 --> 29:46.595
to the underlying principles
that explain them.

29:46.636 --> 29:48.805
Observation of nature is the authority.

29:48.847 --> 29:54.936
By contrast, deductive reasoning moves
from general truths to specific conclusions.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.957
- Oh. Hello. Is Theo in?
- You must be Zak, yes?

30:16.082 --> 30:17.500
Come in.

30:19.127 --> 30:21.212
Theo, Zak's here!

30:40.398 --> 30:41.482
Don't worry.

30:41.482 --> 30:43.943
- I always come at a bad time.
- Nonsense.

30:44.235 --> 30:46.320
I'm sorry for the discord.

30:46.362 --> 30:49.323
Concertos can be
such messy things, can't they?

30:49.615 --> 30:50.950
Take a seat.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.751
Theo has told us all about you.

31:06.048 --> 31:08.217
Tell me, Zak. Do you play?

31:08.509 --> 31:11.178
No. People like me
have a problem with rhythm.

31:11.178 --> 31:12.263
Tosh.

31:12.388 --> 31:15.766
Everybody can play something.
Everybody.

31:15.891 --> 31:18.936
All you need is heart, soul,
and a little imagination.

31:18.936 --> 31:20.604
You have those?

31:22.606 --> 31:24.608
Play any three notes.

31:24.608 --> 31:28.112
Play them at any time,
for any length, in any order.

33:33.736 --> 33:36.739
- I like the patterns.
- Progressions.

33:36.781 --> 33:38.491
I can see them.

33:38.533 --> 33:40.910
Then you just might be a player.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.416
- Hello, Theo.
- What's up?

33:46.582 --> 33:50.586
I've got an extra homework project.
I need a little help.

33:52.422 --> 33:55.591
Now, to start. This is you.

33:59.679 --> 34:02.348
And this is Marie.

34:05.268 --> 34:09.856
You resonate
on an Ultra-Low frequency.

34:14.694 --> 34:17.655
She resonates on an Ultra-High.

34:21.492 --> 34:24.203
And this is what happens
when you get together.

34:24.286 --> 34:27.456
You repel like
two High-powered magnets.

34:27.623 --> 34:32.878
If you want any chance with Marie,
that's the problem we have to solve.

34:33.629 --> 34:35.755
- Can I have the chalk?
- What have you seen?

34:35.755 --> 34:37.132
I've seen a pattern.

34:37.132 --> 34:38.759
"O"...

34:39.092 --> 34:40.969
"X"...

34:41.594 --> 34:43.054
"V".

34:55.234 --> 34:56.777
What is it, Zak?

34:56.819 --> 34:58.070
Sorry, Miss.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.906
- Not ready, Zak?
- I was, but then--

35:00.906 --> 35:03.200
Every time, Zak.

35:03.534 --> 35:05.869
Not every time, Miss.
Just most times.

35:05.869 --> 35:07.996
Can't blame frequency for everything.

35:08.163 --> 35:09.373
No, Miss.

35:10.207 --> 35:13.919
They say that inventions
mirror their inventors,

35:13.961 --> 35:16.588
and yours is a mess, Zak.

35:17.506 --> 35:19.925
So, what do we have here, Theo?

35:20.008 --> 35:22.678
A simulation game?
That's more fun.

35:22.678 --> 35:24.930
A simulation, but not a game.

35:25.013 --> 35:27.015
A reflection, a sim of life.

35:27.015 --> 35:29.643
- Whose?
- Everyone's.

35:29.726 --> 35:31.186
You've modeled it on this world?

35:31.353 --> 35:34.022
We know it is mathematically
possible for one rule,

35:34.022 --> 35:37.359
constantly repeated, to create
seemingly random results.

35:37.359 --> 35:41.029
My hypothesis is that all life
is not random.

35:41.279 --> 35:43.407
I believe that one rule is at work--

35:43.407 --> 35:46.785
One equation, one set of actions that
acted on the first element of matter...

35:46.785 --> 35:49.121
- and keeps acting on it.
- Fascinating.

35:49.121 --> 35:52.958
Life seems chaotic, but in fact,
it's just an infinitely complex pattern.

35:52.999 --> 35:55.836
You realize you are searching
for the code to life?

35:55.919 --> 35:57.295
It's not perfected yet, but--

35:57.295 --> 35:58.797
If what you're saying is right,

35:58.797 --> 36:01.842
then it assumes that
we are simply complex machines,

36:01.842 --> 36:04.761
that we may not have a soul,
certainly not any free will.

36:04.761 --> 36:06.972
I'm sorry. Are they important?

36:07.264 --> 36:10.642
Okay.
I'll go along with it for now...

36:10.892 --> 36:14.437
Though if this is real, you'll be able to tell me
what's going to happen next, won't you?

36:14.437 --> 36:15.730
Of course.

36:17.232 --> 36:19.067
Just the next five minutes.

36:20.485 --> 36:23.279
In about seven seconds,

36:23.238 --> 36:24.906
Nicola-Tesla's gonna come over.

36:24.906 --> 36:29.077
In about 31 seconds,
Zak is gonna cross the room.

36:29.077 --> 36:32.664
And in precisely two minutes,

36:32.872 --> 36:34.791
the fire alarms are gonna sound.

36:35.375 --> 36:39.045
Miss. Anderson, I've just seen
Thomas-Edison's project,

36:39.045 --> 36:42.549
and I think he's stolen my idea.

36:42.590 --> 36:44.217
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

36:44.300 --> 36:45.218
Miss. Anderson.

36:45.218 --> 36:47.428
You told her to do this.
Go away, Nicola.

36:47.428 --> 36:48.471
Miss. Anderson!

36:48.471 --> 36:49.889
Not now.

36:56.562 --> 36:59.148
Go on, Zak.
It's clearly part of the plan.

37:09.033 --> 37:11.035
We leave the Low-Frequencies.

37:12.411 --> 37:13.955
Pass the Medium-Low.

37:15.957 --> 37:17.458
Through the mediums.

37:20.419 --> 37:22.505
'scuse me.. Excuse me.

37:26.008 --> 37:28.219
Now just through the High-Frequencies.

37:31.347 --> 37:32.390
Zak!

37:32.682 --> 37:35.101
- Hi, mom.
- Why are you not at your stand?

37:35.142 --> 37:37.019
- I--
- This is important!

37:37.228 --> 37:38.396
Come on.

37:40.940 --> 37:42.441
You almost had me.

37:42.483 --> 37:44.443
I have a sense of humor
like everyone else,

37:44.443 --> 37:47.154
but I'm disappointed that
you've decided to play games...

37:47.154 --> 37:49.615
instead of taking this fair seriously.

37:51.075 --> 37:52.493
It's not a game.

37:52.493 --> 37:53.911
Hi.

37:55.829 --> 37:56.789
Hi.

37:56.830 --> 37:58.165
I was wondering...

37:58.249 --> 38:00.459
would you like to meet me
after school?

38:06.382 --> 38:08.717
- Say "Thank you".
- Thank you.

38:08.759 --> 38:10.344
Best I could do at short notice.

38:10.386 --> 38:12.012
It's got the highest measurable remanence.

38:12.054 --> 38:14.515
If anything can disrupt
your frequency, this can.

38:14.515 --> 38:16.225
At last, I'm attractive.

38:16.350 --> 38:19.520
Well, only to metal--
An unfortunate side effect.

38:19.520 --> 38:23.607
Everything has a side effect.
My whole life's a side effect.

38:24.149 --> 38:25.609
You think it'll work?

38:26.026 --> 38:26.944
No.

38:40.540 --> 38:42.334
Are you wearing anything metal?

38:42.334 --> 38:45.045
We just wanted to see
the experiment.

38:47.881 --> 38:51.051
Sorry I'm late.
Got locked in a corridor.

38:52.344 --> 38:53.595
Hello.

38:55.055 --> 38:57.224
The latest recipe.

38:57.766 --> 38:59.643
- Say "Thank you".
- Thank you.

38:59.726 --> 39:02.437
Oh, and, remember to try
not to throw up.

39:02.562 --> 39:04.773
Good. We're alone.

39:05.232 --> 39:06.566
How are you?

39:10.779 --> 39:12.948
It's not that
I don't want to touch.

39:15.533 --> 39:17.661
A one-minute date?

39:18.495 --> 39:19.537
Yes.

39:22.374 --> 39:26.753
I do not love my family.
I experience no joy.

39:26.795 --> 39:31.007
If you ever see me smile,
frown, laugh or cry,

39:31.174 --> 39:32.717
I'm pretending...

39:33.843 --> 39:36.304
waiting for it to become real.

39:36.554 --> 39:38.264
And it never will.

39:38.389 --> 39:40.141
It's the side effect.

39:40.266 --> 39:43.186
The side effect. Of course.

39:45.230 --> 39:47.232
Look at that.
One minute.

39:47.232 --> 39:49.484
Looks like I'm leaving right on time.

39:49.525 --> 39:53.738
The two of us are just
not destined to be together.

40:01.454 --> 40:02.955
Irony--

40:03.164 --> 40:06.125
The indirect presentation
of a contradiction...

40:06.167 --> 40:12.006
between an action or expression
and the context in which it occurs.

40:12.548 --> 40:14.675
Ironic particle--

40:15.134 --> 40:17.970
The physical manifestation of irony,

40:17.970 --> 40:21.265
existing latent
in every atom in the universe.

40:21.349 --> 40:23.976
But my preliminary research suggests...

40:23.976 --> 40:27.521
that the ironic particles
are only activated by the brain...

40:27.521 --> 40:30.691
when we want something,
and so forming...

40:30.775 --> 40:35.696
a Desire chain.

40:36.739 --> 40:39.033
But only by a certain type of person.

40:39.075 --> 40:42.078
- A Low-Frequency person.
- Yes.

40:42.411 --> 40:45.623
My research indicates that
only they are susceptible to irony.

40:45.623 --> 40:48.292
Is not irony
in the eye of the beholder?

40:48.375 --> 40:52.129
Yes, but the beholder
is the individual involved,

40:52.171 --> 40:54.256
hence the Desire chain.

40:54.548 --> 40:58.886
In everyday terms, it's why
they never get what they really want.

40:58.886 --> 41:02.806
But my hypothesis,
and the purpose of the research grant...

41:02.806 --> 41:04.600
I'm hoping you'll give me,

41:04.600 --> 41:08.812
is that it is possible
to reverse this effect.

41:09.021 --> 41:12.191
The mental changes the physical.

41:13.525 --> 41:15.778
It's all about patterns.

41:15.944 --> 41:18.238
The first stage is to want something,

41:18.238 --> 41:22.117
recognize the potential irony,
and then to change your Desire chain.

41:22.117 --> 41:23.952
Sorry to interrupt,

41:23.911 --> 41:27.748
but that sounds suspiciously
like you're trying to fool fate...

41:27.873 --> 41:31.084
and I just don't think
that's possible.

41:32.586 --> 41:35.756
Well... I do, Sir.

41:50.520 --> 41:53.440
Hi. This is Theo.
You know what to do.

41:54.191 --> 41:55.317
Hey. It's me.

41:55.317 --> 41:57.944
I feel like having a drinking
session tonight, so as usual,

41:57.986 --> 42:02.240
any assistance you can provide
would be gratefully appreciated.

42:09.289 --> 42:10.916
- Doctor Zak.
- Doctor Theo.

42:10.916 --> 42:12.584
Brought supplies.

42:12.667 --> 42:14.711
Say "Thank you".

42:27.766 --> 42:29.851
So, what's on the menu?

42:30.018 --> 42:33.646
Our latest test substances
from the research lab...

42:33.646 --> 42:37.025
all with very interesting side effects.

42:41.112 --> 42:42.655
To side effects.

42:45.241 --> 42:46.743
To side effects.

43:02.050 --> 43:07.889
- Too much tea.
- Too much... "Midenzobetritate".

43:08.973 --> 43:11.893
- Any change?
- Not yet.

43:12.351 --> 43:14.228
Give me another three.

43:17.231 --> 43:18.483
Sorry.

43:19.150 --> 43:23.779
Right. So, we're mixing
three Pyridinecarboxamide...

43:23.863 --> 43:26.657
with Tetracotinate Triptothol.

43:29.911 --> 43:31.245
What was that?

43:34.248 --> 43:36.417
A fluctuation.

43:37.043 --> 43:39.003
An upward fluctuation.

43:39.003 --> 43:41.172
- You're sure?
- Yes!

43:41.213 --> 43:44.592
- But it didn't last long.
- Any effect should last hours.

43:44.592 --> 43:47.470
Maybe it's not the drugs.

43:47.553 --> 43:49.472
Another variable.

43:49.805 --> 43:52.433
But what else has changed?

43:52.767 --> 43:55.436
Let's repeat the last 60 seconds.

43:58.189 --> 44:01.734
- Too much tea.
- Too much Midenzobetritate.

44:01.942 --> 44:03.986
- Any change?
- No, not yet.

44:03.986 --> 44:05.613
Give me another three.

44:07.156 --> 44:08.199
Sorry.

44:08.199 --> 44:11.785
Right, so, we're mixing three
Pyridinecarboxamide...

44:11.785 --> 44:16.206
with Tetracotinate Triptothol.

44:18.959 --> 44:20.419
Triptothol.

44:22.463 --> 44:23.797
Cotina--

44:27.134 --> 44:29.344
Sound waves.

44:30.179 --> 44:33.390
But sound waves was
the first thing everyone tried.

44:33.474 --> 44:36.101
It's not just the waves.

44:37.019 --> 44:38.812
It's the words.

44:40.314 --> 44:42.941
But the effect only lasts a moment.

44:43.358 --> 44:47.613
So... some fine-tuning needed, then.

44:49.406 --> 44:51.908
Sign here, please.
Thank you.

46:02.437 --> 46:04.814
Remember, it's a trial run.

46:04.856 --> 46:07.734
You've got 65 seconds, then get out.

46:07.859 --> 46:10.069
It'll get easier each time.

46:14.407 --> 46:16.159
Victan.

46:16.409 --> 46:19.787
Back in a minute... more or less.

46:20.788 --> 46:21.998
Victan.

46:33.467 --> 46:35.136
Hello.

46:36.554 --> 46:38.014
Hello.

46:39.056 --> 46:42.768
- Zak.
- It's been a long time.

46:43.978 --> 46:45.521
- Where did you get to?
- Kaichi.

46:45.563 --> 46:46.731
Oh, everywhere.

46:46.856 --> 46:51.694
- Sao Paulo,
- Kaichi
- Buenos Aires, Kaichi, Kinshasa.

46:51.861 --> 46:53.654
But most recently, Vilnius.

46:53.654 --> 46:56.198
I can now curse convincingly
in 18 languages.

46:56.240 --> 46:59.577
Where's Kaichi?
I've not heard of it before.

46:59.618 --> 47:00.953
Relax.

47:00.995 --> 47:03.622
You don't need to pretend to care.

47:23.434 --> 47:24.810
Solas.

47:25.477 --> 47:27.021
Solas.

47:36.029 --> 47:37.865
Glad you could make it.

47:45.622 --> 47:48.041
Expecting a call?

47:48.417 --> 47:52.588
- Yes.
- How did you last more than a minute?

47:53.213 --> 47:56.300
- I changed my frequency.
- You know that's not possible.

47:56.300 --> 47:58.260
Knowledge determines destiny.
I--

47:58.343 --> 48:01.096
You did this?
You found the solution?

48:00.929 --> 48:02.556
Yes.

48:04.141 --> 48:06.852
- Does that surprise you?
- Yes.

48:07.644 --> 48:09.521
You are Low-Frequency.

48:09.771 --> 48:11.231
Not anymore.

48:12.107 --> 48:14.359
What we know
about frequency is wrong.

48:14.443 --> 48:16.528
Otherwise, you and I
would never have met.

48:16.528 --> 48:19.114
You said you could help me.

48:19.197 --> 48:20.740
I can change your frequency.

48:21.074 --> 48:24.202
- Lower it?
- I hardly think it gets much higher.

48:24.202 --> 48:27.289
But nature works hard
to give me everything.

48:27.414 --> 48:30.292
- Almost everything.
- Tell me the process.

48:32.210 --> 48:33.670
It's...

48:37.549 --> 48:39.009
- Okay.
- Okay.

48:43.513 --> 48:45.348
I don't think you're gonna like it.

48:45.348 --> 48:47.767
Essentially, it's an energy exchange.

48:47.767 --> 48:50.937
I'll be bringing you down
a lot closer to my level.

48:51.563 --> 48:56.860
There are a lot of processes
at work, but one of them...

48:57.485 --> 48:59.612
is me...

49:01.656 --> 49:03.616
- touching you.
- Clever.

49:03.616 --> 49:07.829
The negative feedback loop should
eventually be self-reinforcing, but...

49:07.829 --> 49:11.499
I will need to be
physically close to you for a while.

49:11.499 --> 49:12.875
Very clever.

49:14.669 --> 49:16.462
How soon will I see results?

49:16.462 --> 49:19.882
If it works as I think it should, instantly.

49:21.551 --> 49:24.887
- You want to do it. I can tell.
- Please don't lie.

49:25.096 --> 49:26.264
Vuren.

49:26.389 --> 49:28.516
Vuren's... sake.

49:29.517 --> 49:31.978
You will have feelings
for the first time in your life.

49:32.019 --> 49:33.479
Theoretically.

49:33.479 --> 49:35.189
Is it reversible?

49:35.731 --> 49:39.193
It should be.
But there are no guarantees.

49:59.296 --> 50:00.756
That's it?

50:00.798 --> 50:03.676
The main part.
It may not work.

50:03.926 --> 50:06.345
I've decided you can talk if you want.

50:06.345 --> 50:07.847
Thanks.

50:15.980 --> 50:19.817
It's weird, talking to you
without a deadline.

50:21.151 --> 50:22.987
Or-- Or not talking.

50:34.498 --> 50:38.752
- Are you okay?
- I don't think I'm feeling too well.

50:39.294 --> 50:43.549
- Feeling?
- Feeling physically sick is not an emotion.

50:45.551 --> 50:48.887
But that's not this feeling.

51:23.755 --> 51:27.050
This is... awful.

51:27.384 --> 51:29.135
I feel a huge weight.

51:29.135 --> 51:31.471
I think that's just nerves.

51:41.606 --> 51:47.404
It-- It's intense.
I feel... connected to myself.

51:50.156 --> 51:52.158
- How does that feel?
- Not-- Not so good.

51:53.576 --> 51:56.204
It definitely feels better
when we're touching.

51:56.371 --> 51:57.664
Why is that?

52:01.000 --> 52:02.627
Because...

52:05.880 --> 52:07.632
- Unith.
- Unith.

52:08.758 --> 52:09.801
You love me.

52:11.803 --> 52:12.929
Maybe.

52:13.721 --> 52:15.640
- Where.
- Where?

52:16.557 --> 52:19.769
- I think nature's rebelling.
- Just like old times.

52:20.103 --> 52:22.438
- Should we do anything?
- No.

52:22.480 --> 52:26.150
It should settle down,
the longer we spend together.

52:29.237 --> 52:32.031
- Eesa.
- Eesa.

52:35.868 --> 52:37.870
- I know what I want to try.
- What?

52:37.912 --> 52:39.622
- Kiss me.
- Really?

52:39.789 --> 52:41.958
Don't make me ask again.
I'm used to getting what I want.

52:42.208 --> 52:43.459
I'm not.

53:10.319 --> 53:13.572
<font color=1275ef>(ZAK + MARIE)</font>

53:20.996 --> 53:24.083
Do you want to come in
and touch some more?

53:28.087 --> 53:29.546
Can I?

53:42.601 --> 53:45.437
- Do you think... maybe...
- Yes?

53:45.562 --> 53:47.481
You could go a bit faster?

53:49.650 --> 53:52.069
I want it to be special.

53:52.069 --> 53:54.113
You think I'm a virgin?

53:54.113 --> 53:56.448
I've conducted many experiments.

53:58.659 --> 54:01.411
And... your conclusions?

54:01.495 --> 54:03.914
Sex is like masturbation,
just with someone else.

54:03.997 --> 54:05.457
I hope not.

54:06.541 --> 54:09.670
You're a virgin.
Of course.

54:09.753 --> 54:13.298
I may not have conducted many
experiments, but I have...

54:13.340 --> 54:16.009
studied very, very hard.

55:09.771 --> 55:11.314
Mentha.

55:40.885 --> 55:42.637
Open it.

55:44.347 --> 55:47.099
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

55:47.517 --> 55:50.353
We were raised to have
a burning curiosity.

55:50.353 --> 55:51.687
Open it.

56:07.370 --> 56:09.121
I don't understand.

56:10.331 --> 56:11.916
Is it some sort of code?

56:13.292 --> 56:15.961
Sometimes a tick is just a tick.

56:23.469 --> 56:28.557
I have a 210 I.Q.
I never needed to take notes.

56:28.599 --> 56:31.769
I just didn't want to have to
always look at people...

56:31.769 --> 56:34.230
or have them looking at me.

56:34.480 --> 56:35.981
It's the eyes.

56:37.024 --> 56:41.946
I could never read people's eyes--
not-- not like other people-- and...

56:42.029 --> 56:46.742
if they looked into mine
for too long, they'd realize--

57:25.030 --> 57:26.615
Was that our train?

57:27.449 --> 57:29.201
Welcome to my world.

57:49.221 --> 57:50.847
Are you okay?

57:54.809 --> 57:57.145
I've never waited for a train before.

58:05.111 --> 58:06.696
It's not all bad, though.

58:15.246 --> 58:17.790
So, where are we going?

58:20.877 --> 58:22.629
- Daughter.
- Father.

58:27.926 --> 58:31.888
- Daughter's friend.
- Sorry about the state of the place.

58:31.888 --> 58:34.766
We're having some work done.

58:37.518 --> 58:41.814
So, Zak, how have you been
since you left school?

58:41.814 --> 58:44.734
A serious question,
or polite conversation?

58:44.776 --> 58:46.694
Polite conversation.

58:46.819 --> 58:48.362
Very well, Mrs. Fortune.

58:48.362 --> 58:50.239
Call me Hettie, Zak.

58:50.656 --> 58:52.116
And yourself, Hettie?

58:52.158 --> 58:53.826
Fine, dear. Just fine.

58:53.868 --> 58:55.661
What is this, mother?

58:55.912 --> 58:57.747
Since when have we done small talk?

58:57.788 --> 59:00.499
Since when have you
brought a boy home?

59:10.384 --> 59:11.761
Ask him.

59:13.804 --> 59:15.306
Ask him.

59:15.681 --> 59:18.559
You're not really having
any work done, are you?

59:18.976 --> 59:21.270
You still think something bad's
gonna happen.

59:21.312 --> 59:25.107
You don't believe that Zak solved anything
because he's Low-Frequency.

59:25.191 --> 59:27.443
- It's just a precaution.
- Relax.

59:27.526 --> 59:31.739
Nothing will happen,
and then we can discuss why.

59:43.918 --> 59:45.961
But how did you do it?

59:46.003 --> 59:50.674
I mean, I did some research myself,
long ago when Marie was young.

59:50.883 --> 59:53.260
It seemed impossible.

59:58.015 --> 59:59.975
- Words.
- Words?

01:00:00.017 --> 01:00:02.019
- The right words.
- What? Magic words?

01:00:02.019 --> 01:00:04.062
We think so, me and Theo.

01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:07.191
You remember Theodor-Adorno?
He's been helping me.

01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:10.944
We discovered a link between
synaptic function and resonance.

01:00:10.944 --> 01:00:13.155
The way you think affects
your frequency.

01:00:13.155 --> 01:00:16.116
Think lucky,
and you'll be lucky.

01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:17.492
Not quite.

01:00:17.492 --> 01:00:22.247
The synapses need to be
manipulated in a certain way.

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:25.917
These are you--
All High-Frequency.

01:00:31.256 --> 01:00:33.050
And this is the world.

01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:39.014
And this is me.

01:00:41.725 --> 01:00:44.436
Now, what the words do is this.

01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:10.420
- Well, that's never happened before.
- Spilling some water?

01:01:10.545 --> 01:01:12.714
Marie spilling anything.

01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:17.093
- What have you done to my daughter?
- What I asked him to do.

01:01:17.135 --> 01:01:18.928
Let me explain.

01:01:21.514 --> 01:01:25.894
Me. Marie.
Now, this is how the words work.

01:01:29.105 --> 01:01:34.068
- You steal people's frequencies?
- It's just physics.

01:01:34.068 --> 01:01:36.654
They balance the environment.

01:01:37.071 --> 01:01:40.533
In actuality,
what really happens is this.

01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:47.498
Both the vibrations
of the sound waves...

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.334
and the words themselves
create the effect.

01:01:50.334 --> 01:01:52.670
It's a new type of
quantum entanglement.

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:56.257
Mental and physical processes
at work simultaneously.

01:01:56.299 --> 01:01:59.969
Like dominos, and each person
affected affects the next,

01:02:00.011 --> 01:02:02.513
- ultimately adjusting--
- The whole world.

01:02:02.555 --> 01:02:04.724
He's the only one
that can make me Normal.

01:02:04.807 --> 01:02:06.893
I'm the only one
that can make him Normal.

01:02:06.934 --> 01:02:08.311
It's unnatural.

01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:10.354
But it's reversible.

01:02:10.563 --> 01:02:13.024
The natural order reverts itself
very quickly.

01:02:13.065 --> 01:02:15.526
One word can change the world.

01:02:15.526 --> 01:02:16.902
Not one.

01:02:16.944 --> 01:02:18.779
Nature needs constant nurturing.

01:02:18.779 --> 01:02:20.781
What-- you have to keep saying them?

01:02:20.781 --> 01:02:23.117
Yes, but less and less often because--

01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:27.747
because you are like a Low-Frequency
organ in a High-Frequency body...

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:31.208
- A virus!
- ...and the word prevents rejection.

01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:35.963
Yes, but the words constantly change
as the environment constantly changes.

01:02:35.963 --> 01:02:40.509
- We worked out a rough formula of sound--
- How do you monitor the changes?

01:02:40.509 --> 01:02:44.763
It's a modification of
Marie's frequency analyzer.

01:02:44.889 --> 01:02:47.516
It measure
the changes in the room...

01:02:47.516 --> 01:02:51.812
and then formulates a word that
I should say to balance the environment.

01:02:51.854 --> 01:02:53.689
It's still in beta.

01:02:54.106 --> 01:02:55.441
Can I?

01:03:04.366 --> 01:03:08.495
If the world is a maze,
this is the map.

01:03:08.746 --> 01:03:10.706
Do you realize
what you've done?

01:03:10.747 --> 01:03:12.040
Made me happy.

01:03:12.124 --> 01:03:15.919
I mean, this could be the most
important discovery of all time!

01:03:15.961 --> 01:03:17.838
There's still so much about it
we don't know.

01:03:17.838 --> 01:03:19.715
It levels the playing field.

01:03:19.715 --> 01:03:22.968
I mean, think what would happen if
everybody uses it--

01:03:22.968 --> 01:03:29.141
No lucky, no unlucky, true balance
in the universe for the first time.

01:03:29.182 --> 01:03:31.518
An end to war.

01:03:31.727 --> 01:03:33.395
Justice for all.

01:03:38.817 --> 01:03:41.111
Have you got a patent?

01:03:42.487 --> 01:03:45.657
Hi. This is Theo.
You know what to do.

01:03:46.158 --> 01:03:48.034
Hey, it's Zak.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.079
Good news, we're meeting tomorrow
at Fortune's lab.

01:03:51.121 --> 01:03:53.290
Call me when you get this.

01:04:15.562 --> 01:04:18.481
It really is extremely small.

01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:20.650
Zak! Zak, come in.

01:04:23.528 --> 01:04:25.488
You know my research team,
I believe.

01:04:26.114 --> 01:04:27.657
Sorry.
No, I don't think we've--

01:04:27.699 --> 01:04:29.534
Nicola-Tesla Hertz.

01:04:29.534 --> 01:04:31.619
Nicola-Tesla. Oh, my God.

01:04:34.163 --> 01:04:36.916
And Thomas-Edison Gates.

01:04:37.458 --> 01:04:39.002
Sit. Sit.

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:48.845
- How do you feel?
- Great.

01:04:51.514 --> 01:04:55.810
We've been trying to improve the range of
Marie's frequency analyzer for years,

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.729
so we'd love to know how you did it.

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:59.897
That was actually Theo.

01:05:00.106 --> 01:05:04.235
I know that if you pointed it
45 degrees to the subject, that helps,

01:05:04.318 --> 01:05:07.655
but he dealt with most of the hardware.

01:05:15.454 --> 01:05:17.248
I think I love you.

01:05:17.248 --> 01:05:21.460
And this is how we detect imbalance
and formulate the sounds,

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.798
although we still don't know why
they all seem to be two syllables.

01:05:26.966 --> 01:05:30.761
I--
I... think I love you, too.

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:37.059
I... believe I need
more empirical evidence.

01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:40.563
How-- How does this love
manifest itself?

01:05:40.563 --> 01:05:42.565
Whatever you ask, I'll do.

01:05:42.565 --> 01:05:44.733
- Anything?
- Yeah.

01:05:45.192 --> 01:05:46.610
And you?

01:05:46.819 --> 01:05:49.154
I wouldn't do anything for you.

01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:53.325
Spellings are phonetic,
but the words are only approximations,

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:55.619
which is why the earpiece
is still necessary.

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:58.914
In this case, the word
to balance frequencies is "Rana".

01:05:58.914 --> 01:06:02.334
So far, there have been no words that
are impossible for a human to pronounce,

01:06:02.376 --> 01:06:04.712
but there's still so much
we don't know.

01:06:04.712 --> 01:06:06.714
So, you wouldn't do
anything for me, then?

01:06:06.714 --> 01:06:08.173
No.

01:06:08.716 --> 01:06:10.134
Onro.

01:06:10.134 --> 01:06:14.346
Not even kneel on the floor
and call me "Master".

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:21.186
Master.

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:25.232
Everybody, stop.
It's arrived.

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:31.613
Just wait till this hits the market.

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:34.825
Why did I do that?
I had to do that.

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:40.706
What-- What do I not want to do?

01:06:41.665 --> 01:06:43.542
I don't want to leave this room.

01:06:49.256 --> 01:06:51.508
I don't want to fly a plane.

01:06:56.972 --> 01:06:59.474
What would you normally not do?

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:04.271
- I told you, if you asked, I'd do anything.
- Don't disrupt the experiment.

01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:07.357
What's against character for you?

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:11.778
- Any kind of violence.
- Fabulous.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:14.572
Kera.

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:16.950
Slap me hard around the face.

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:28.753
It must be love.

01:07:28.837 --> 01:07:31.965
It seems you discovered a side effect.

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:35.552
We're categorizing them
as adjustments for now.

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:38.972
Whatever you ask someone to do
after you say one of these, they'll do.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:39.931
Anything?

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.225
And it doesn't have to be
something they say immediately.

01:07:42.267 --> 01:07:43.685
As far as we can tell,

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:47.563
the influence can be short, medium,
or potentially long-term.

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:50.608
The words trigger
all neurotransmitters to work together,

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.694
making the suggestion irresistible.

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:53.778
How?

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:56.197
We don't know.

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:03.371
- Is there a pattern to these words?
- No.

01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:06.499
Apart from the fact
that they're always the last on the list.

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:07.917
Oh, everywhere--

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:11.212
Sao Paulo,
Buenos Aires, Kaichi.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:14.590
I can't explain it. I can now curse
convincingly in 18 languages.

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.466
He must know. He's lying.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:17.510
Not quite.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:20.971
- The synapses must be manipulated
in a certain way.
- No.

01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:24.684
For Vuren's sake, you'll have feelings
for the first time in your life.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:27.560
- Maybe we've got the wrong inventor.
- No.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.647
- Where is Theo?
- I don't know.

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:32.066
He doesn't know anything.
I knew he couldn't have done it!

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.943
He's Low-Frequency!

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:34.984
Unith.

01:08:34.984 --> 01:08:38.863
Well, we'll have to abandon
the launch permanently greater...

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:42.118
You love me.

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:44.662
No.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.247
He did it.

01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:50.501
He made me feel like this.

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:52.627
- He told me.
- What?

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:56.631
He told me to love him.

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:01.470
No, it-- it must have been an accident.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:04.265
Like-- Like she said,
It-- It's a side effect.

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:07.100
I said the first word on the list.

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.895
You have to believe me!

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:17.277
If we believe you, then you are
just a fool who got lucky.

01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:21.615
If we don't you are a lying genius.

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:25.368
I'm sure you'll appreciate the irony.

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:51.435
- Hi. This is Theo. You know what to do.
- Where are you?!

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:58.610
The side effects.

01:09:59.653 --> 01:10:02.155
What have you done?

01:10:15.126 --> 01:10:17.504
You must sign.

01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:20.173
It must be suppressed.

01:10:23.093 --> 01:10:25.679
- I want to see Marie.
- I'm sure you do.

01:10:28.306 --> 01:10:32.560
- Tell her I can fix this.
- Can you?

01:10:49.494 --> 01:10:53.248
Soon, everything
will be back to normal.

01:10:58.544 --> 01:11:02.006
- You have reached the Messae bank of...
- Marie-Curie Fortune.

01:11:02.006 --> 01:11:06.427
...And I'm currently unable to take your call.
Please leave a short message at the tone.

01:11:06.427 --> 01:11:09.097
Hi. This is Theo.
You know what to do.

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:15.061
If you want to find true love,
stop here.

<font color=cyan>(Ministry of partnership)</font>

01:11:19.023 --> 01:11:21.943
If you want to find true love,
stop here.

01:11:24.237 --> 01:11:25.530
<font color=cyan>(ISAAC-NEWTON MIDGELEY)</font>
- Thank you.

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:28.241
You have reached the messae bank of...

01:11:28.241 --> 01:11:29.617
Checking.

01:11:31.577 --> 01:11:34.288
- Three matches found.
- You know what to do.

01:11:42.463 --> 01:11:44.882
Status: Single

01:11:44.882 --> 01:11:47.051
Would you like to contact?

01:11:48.219 --> 01:11:49.637
Laura Warwick.

01:11:49.637 --> 01:11:51.430

01:11:52.890 --> 01:11:55.309
Status: Married

01:11:55.309 --> 01:11:56.727
Would you like to contact?

01:11:56.769 --> 01:11:59.522
- Please leave a short messae at the tone.
- Ana Della Matta.

01:11:59.522 --> 01:12:00.940
Age: 24

01:12:02.816 --> 01:12:04.318
Status: Deceased

01:12:04.318 --> 01:12:05.945
Would you like to contact?

01:12:05.945 --> 01:12:07.655
Marie-Curie Fortune.

01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:42.248
- What--
- Please. Do not speak.

01:13:42.749 --> 01:13:44.459
But please also
do not be alarmed.

01:13:44.542 --> 01:13:48.421
We're just your friendly
local-government agency.

01:13:53.468 --> 01:13:55.345
Not one of yours.

01:13:55.595 --> 01:13:57.305
One of ours.

01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:03.770
We're here to ask you three questions.
Nod for "Yes", shake for "No".

01:14:06.105 --> 01:14:10.526
Mumyad.
Did you steal this technology?

01:14:14.072 --> 01:14:15.281
Sirah.

01:14:15.823 --> 01:14:19.660
Did you leak the device's program
or schematics?

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.538
Visten.

01:14:22.955 --> 01:14:27.126
Do you have any plans of any kind...

01:14:29.045 --> 01:14:31.756
to manipulate the world?

01:14:36.177 --> 01:14:37.637
You may speak now.

01:14:37.678 --> 01:14:41.349
Those words
make me tell the truth?

01:14:41.432 --> 01:14:43.392
- Yes.
- But how do you know they work?

01:14:43.392 --> 01:14:45.144
I've done this before.

01:14:46.479 --> 01:14:48.814
Now, how would you like a job?

01:14:48.814 --> 01:14:52.735
The hours are terrible, but you
do get free room and board.

01:15:22.848 --> 01:15:27.269
As of now, you are all
officially government employees...

01:15:27.311 --> 01:15:30.939
and bound by the official secrets act.

01:15:30.939 --> 01:15:35.986
Your task is to find a way
to neutralize the threat...

01:15:35.986 --> 01:15:41.617
which the technology known as
"The Manual" poses to this country.

01:15:41.617 --> 01:15:44.870
In front of you, you'll find a file
which contains all the information...

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:48.206
we have on the subject
and an historical account...

01:15:48.206 --> 01:15:52.419
of what happened the last time
it was in the public domain.

01:15:52.419 --> 01:15:57.174
You have stumbled upon
very old technology,

01:15:57.174 --> 01:15:59.468
mostly lost to us, fortunately.

01:15:59.509 --> 01:16:04.473
The remnants are always kept top secret
and are analyzed for generations...

01:16:04.556 --> 01:16:07.184
with little success.

01:16:07.392 --> 01:16:11.313
And then, inevitably,
elements are rediscovered...

01:16:11.313 --> 01:16:16.985
by the general population,
and chaos ensues.

01:16:16.985 --> 01:16:18.737
You've heard the stories--

01:16:18.737 --> 01:16:20.947
Wizards, witches.

01:16:20.947 --> 01:16:25.911
The mastery of the tech was
what first established the ruling classes...

01:16:25.911 --> 01:16:32.083
and was the main contributing factor
to most wars until 1066.

01:16:32.083 --> 01:16:34.002
We don't know why.

01:16:34.002 --> 01:16:38.923
It had a steep decline
in its effectiveness from about 1100.

01:16:38.923 --> 01:16:45.054
That last known date of
any successful usage was about 1760.

01:16:45.346 --> 01:16:47.557
We don't know why.

01:16:48.141 --> 01:16:51.478
And now it's out there again.

01:16:51.686 --> 01:16:53.855
Thank you all.

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:58.401
But I'm sure you'll find a way
to put it back.

01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:05.491
The ground rules--

01:17:05.491 --> 01:17:11.831
If you say or even semi-utter a word
that is not immediately recognizable,

01:17:11.831 --> 01:17:14.334
you will be arrested, gagged,

01:17:14.334 --> 01:17:18.546
and... potentially tried for treason.

01:17:19.714 --> 01:17:24.677
Thomas, you look at physical solutions,
Nicola, linguistic solutions.

01:17:24.677 --> 01:17:27.180
Marie and I will look
at the program itself...

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:31.142
to see if we can't unlock
a few more secrets.

01:17:37.899 --> 01:17:40.902
- What about me?
- You don't work for me.

01:17:41.027 --> 01:17:42.987
You can do what you like.

01:18:10.389 --> 01:18:11.974
What about...

01:18:16.145 --> 01:18:19.106
Maybe. But what if we...

01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:25.195
I know this might
sound ridiculously simple...

01:18:25.195 --> 01:18:30.242
but why don't we just work
on some kind of earplug?

01:18:39.501 --> 01:18:43.297
That'll only make it worse.
What you need is something like this.

01:18:43.297 --> 01:18:46.258
No. You're all wrong.
What you need is something like this.

01:18:48.302 --> 01:18:52.222
Oh, that's very dangerous, daughter,
at that speed.

01:18:52.222 --> 01:18:54.099
It needs to be quick.

01:18:54.099 --> 01:18:56.810
The quicker this is all over,
the better.

01:19:00.314 --> 01:19:02.024
How about...

01:19:03.775 --> 01:19:05.527
It would work...

01:19:05.527 --> 01:19:08.697
because it would kill
most of the population.

01:19:12.325 --> 01:19:17.038
Why don't...
we make an Anti-Manual?

01:19:18.039 --> 01:19:19.374
Because that would take decades.

01:19:19.374 --> 01:19:21.251
I don't mean a real one.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.755
The biggest problem here is that
people actually believe The Manual works.

01:19:25.755 --> 01:19:27.299
Panic causes chaos.

01:19:27.299 --> 01:19:29.217
So, some kind of placebo?

01:19:29.217 --> 01:19:31.177
It would buy us time.

01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:36.850
Or we-- we could distribute
flawed copies of The Manual...

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:39.144
and then discredit the whole technology
a few weeks later.

01:19:39.144 --> 01:19:41.313
That's very devious.

01:19:41.313 --> 01:19:44.190
It is, but if it works,
we should use it.

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:51.448
It should be possible to use The Manual
to convince people not to use The Manual.

01:19:51.448 --> 01:19:54.159
I mean, it-- it would be like
having inoculations at school.

01:19:54.159 --> 01:19:58.496
Everyone would be instructed
never to use it... or to forget it.

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:02.792
Why don't we treat the actual problem
of The Manual and not its symptoms?

01:20:02.792 --> 01:20:05.503
Does it matter?
If it works...

01:20:06.045 --> 01:20:09.507
There's probably a very simple solution
that we all just haven't seen.

01:20:09.507 --> 01:20:11.634
Nature works in patterns.

01:20:11.634 --> 01:20:14.137
Usually, the cure is very close to the disease.

01:20:14.137 --> 01:20:16.806
- Like stinging nettles and dock leaves.
- Yes.

01:20:16.806 --> 01:20:19.976
Maybe there are antidote words.

01:20:24.397 --> 01:20:25.815
Oh, dear.

01:20:29.026 --> 01:20:31.195
We're calling them "Shortcuts".

01:20:31.195 --> 01:20:33.197
They don't need a command
to follow them.

01:20:33.197 --> 01:20:35.283
They are the command.

01:20:35.408 --> 01:20:37.201
What do they do?

01:20:37.535 --> 01:20:40.288
Permission to speak
one of them, Mr. Bridges?

01:20:40.371 --> 01:20:46.419
They commands are all harmless,
and no effects last more than a minute.

01:20:50.631 --> 01:20:51.882
Okay.

01:20:58.222 --> 01:20:59.348
Korlo.

01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:04.979
That means "Sit".

01:21:05.938 --> 01:21:08.649
And the others
mean "Stop" and "Go".

01:21:09.191 --> 01:21:12.444
We seem to have hit
on some basic motor functions, but...

01:21:12.444 --> 01:21:16.615
the effects seem short-lived and
cannot be used twice in the same hour.

01:21:16.615 --> 01:21:19.201
A lot of damage
can be done in an hour.

01:21:19.201 --> 01:21:22.538
Obviously, these words
are banned now.

01:21:22.538 --> 01:21:24.665
Did you know about this?

01:21:49.481 --> 01:21:51.650
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:21:53.443 --> 01:21:56.697
I was thinking,
what you said before...

01:21:56.697 --> 01:22:00.909
about convincing people
not to use The Manual.

01:22:01.702 --> 01:22:04.329
Tell me
I have no feelings for you.

01:22:04.329 --> 01:22:05.706
Adjust me.

01:22:05.706 --> 01:22:07.332
They let you have that?

01:22:07.332 --> 01:22:10.002
For experimentation.

01:22:10.085 --> 01:22:11.753
Command me.

01:22:11.878 --> 01:22:13.714
I don't know how.

01:22:13.922 --> 01:22:15.674
I probably don't need to do anything.

01:22:15.674 --> 01:22:18.260
Now that I'm not using it anymore, things
should go back to normal pretty quickly.

01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:19.886
Oh, they have.

01:22:20.011 --> 01:22:23.223
I can feel myself feeling less.

01:22:23.723 --> 01:22:26.393
But not for you.

01:22:26.935 --> 01:22:28.270
Don't touch me.

01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:29.938
I'm sure I can fix this.

01:22:29.938 --> 01:22:31.022
I know.

01:22:33.733 --> 01:22:35.110
I love you.

01:22:36.861 --> 01:22:39.864
But only because you've told me to.

01:22:41.574 --> 01:22:43.994
Cruel, isn't it?

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.705
Maybe you would have
loved me anyway.

01:22:46.705 --> 01:22:48.373
- Now we'll never know.
- Does it matter?

01:22:48.373 --> 01:22:51.209
- You have to have choice.
- Do you if it works?

01:22:51.209 --> 01:22:52.669
Do it!

01:22:57.549 --> 01:22:59.467
Do it for me.

01:23:02.846 --> 01:23:07.559
- Maybe someone else can.
- No, I've already tried. It has to be you.

01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:16.985
I'm just gonna say the last word
on the list. I don't know if it'll work.

01:23:29.622 --> 01:23:30.957
Endel.

01:23:34.794 --> 01:23:37.463
You do not love me.

01:23:54.897 --> 01:23:56.983
Nothing's changed.

01:23:57.316 --> 01:23:58.693
Time's up.

01:23:58.693 --> 01:24:01.362
I need to speak to
Mr. Midgeley alone.

01:24:05.199 --> 01:24:06.659
Two minutes.

01:24:06.659 --> 01:24:09.870
- It's just not meant to be for us, is it?
- No.

01:24:10.371 --> 01:24:12.540
It's just not meant to be for you.

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:20.631
Can you confirm that this is yours?

01:24:20.631 --> 01:24:23.634
<font color=cyan>(A theory on the manipulation
of ironic particles)
(by Isaac-Newton Midgeley)</font>

01:24:23.676 --> 01:24:24.760
I can.

01:24:24.802 --> 01:24:27.471
- Our top people have had a look at it.
- And?

01:24:27.471 --> 01:24:29.598
They think it's brilliant.

01:24:29.890 --> 01:24:32.518
We think it's time
you stopped all this.

01:24:32.559 --> 01:24:36.939
It's clear you have a history
of obsession with... manipulation.

01:24:36.981 --> 01:24:38.524
No, just irony.

01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:41.610
You are prohibited from speaking
under any circumstances...

01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:44.738
while we decide precisely
how to deal with you.

01:24:44.738 --> 01:24:47.366

- Under any circumstances.

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:31.320
The side effects.

01:27:53.926 --> 01:27:55.302
Side effects.

01:28:11.276 --> 01:28:13.362
The side effects.

01:28:15.781 --> 01:28:17.157
It can't be.

01:28:35.133 --> 01:28:38.720
I know I'm not supposed to talk,
but I need to speak to Bridges.

01:28:38.845 --> 01:28:41.973
No communication,
or you'll be shot.

01:28:48.021 --> 01:28:50.899
No communicating by any means.

01:28:55.403 --> 01:28:57.072
Kevet.

01:28:59.991 --> 01:29:03.161
Don't worry.
The effects should only last a minute.

01:29:31.731 --> 01:29:33.358
- Zak?
- I know.

01:29:36.402 --> 01:29:39.113
It's your protection, isn't it?

01:29:54.795 --> 01:29:57.965
It's why it's always around, isn't it?

01:30:02.678 --> 01:30:04.430
Am I right?

01:30:06.891 --> 01:30:08.184
Yes.

01:30:08.976 --> 01:30:10.686
Then you have to help me.

01:30:10.686 --> 01:30:12.688
They won't let me speak.
You must tell them.

01:30:12.688 --> 01:30:14.440
Must I?

01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:22.782
I must.

01:30:47.973 --> 01:30:51.810
They know your frequency's
reestablished itself.

01:30:51.935 --> 01:30:54.063
They know what happens when
we're together.

01:30:54.313 --> 01:30:55.397
Clever.

01:30:55.397 --> 01:30:57.816
They know that
we should only have one minute,

01:30:57.816 --> 01:31:01.779
- ...that fate should push you out.
- Very clever.

01:31:02.488 --> 01:31:03.906
What if they're wrong?

01:31:03.906 --> 01:31:06.658
They're going to break down the door
after one minute and five seconds.

01:31:06.658 --> 01:31:08.410
They're wrong.

01:31:08.952 --> 01:31:10.537
- What?
- Not yet.

01:31:10.537 --> 01:31:12.706
I have no desire to repeat myself.

01:31:12.748 --> 01:31:15.459
You're Theo's father, aren't you?

01:31:16.627 --> 01:31:17.878
Tell me.

01:31:21.882 --> 01:31:23.258
Tell me!

01:31:27.971 --> 01:31:29.431
Tell me!

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:33.143
- Nobody say a word.
- On the ground.

01:31:33.602 --> 01:31:35.020
On the ground!

01:31:35.604 --> 01:31:37.814
No talking from anybody.

01:31:37.856 --> 01:31:39.816
- He knows something.
- No talking!

01:31:39.858 --> 01:31:41.693
- He knows something.
- No talking!

01:31:41.693 --> 01:31:43.278
What does he know?

01:31:47.449 --> 01:31:49.034
What are you doing?

01:31:53.121 --> 01:31:55.457
Giving you what you want,

01:31:55.749 --> 01:32:01.046
what Zak here has worked out--
The antidote.

01:32:02.422 --> 01:32:04.382
And the antidote is?

01:32:06.551 --> 01:32:08.094
Music.

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:18.938
Well, don't take my word for it.
Try a word.

01:32:22.650 --> 01:32:23.902
Korlo.

01:32:31.284 --> 01:32:34.913
- Is it special music?
- Well, kind of.

01:32:34.913 --> 01:32:36.539
It's mozart.

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:42.086
Listen, gentlemen... and ladies.

01:32:42.837 --> 01:32:47.675
When mozart plays,
we are all the same frequency.

01:32:49.802 --> 01:32:53.681
A brief history lesson.
A secret history.

01:32:54.724 --> 01:32:56.559
There was never any magic,

01:32:56.601 --> 01:33:03.232
only just the book being lost and found,
being written, being rewritten,

01:33:03.274 --> 01:33:07.653
being burned,
being used to control the masses.

01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:11.157
And then... came the music.

01:33:12.199 --> 01:33:17.580
We knew from early on that music held
some power, some power to free us.

01:33:17.747 --> 01:33:21.459
You've heard of the pied piper,
I have no doubt.

01:33:21.959 --> 01:33:26.756
Composer-- literally "To Come".

01:33:27.715 --> 01:33:31.135
The first composers weren't writing
simply to entertain.

01:33:31.135 --> 01:33:34.138
They were writing to give us control
of our minds back.

01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:39.476
With each new piece,
the book was weakened, until...

01:33:40.144 --> 01:33:41.520
Mozart.

01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:43.314
1760.

01:33:43.731 --> 01:33:46.066
His first composition,

01:33:46.108 --> 01:33:50.029
the first piece that
truly immunized us against the book.

01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:52.197
Since then, there've been many.

01:33:52.281 --> 01:33:55.576
When you recognize a melody
you've never heard before,

01:33:55.576 --> 01:33:57.786
that'll be one,

01:33:57.953 --> 01:34:01.165
tapping into our collective subconscious.

01:34:01.707 --> 01:34:07.629
Most complex music just interferes enough
with the book to make it unreliable and,

01:34:07.713 --> 01:34:09.798
so, useless.

01:34:10.841 --> 01:34:12.301
Why was it a secret?

01:34:12.301 --> 01:34:13.802
It wasn't.

01:34:13.844 --> 01:34:16.513
It just fell out of history
by mutual consent.

01:34:16.513 --> 01:34:21.476
There were rulers who still harbored
thoughts of using the book again,

01:34:21.643 --> 01:34:27.065
and the masses didn't take too kindly
to being reminded they are just mechanisms--

01:34:27.065 --> 01:34:29.735
Complex, certainly,

01:34:30.611 --> 01:34:34.489
but mechanisms with buttons
to push, nonetheless.

01:34:34.489 --> 01:34:38.785
Music-- it's the reset button.

01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:43.915
Where is that, precisely?

01:34:45.625 --> 01:34:47.252
The soul.

01:34:48.378 --> 01:34:51.548
And what happens
when the music stops?

01:34:54.050 --> 01:34:56.720
Oh, it can never stop.

01:35:00.015 --> 01:35:04.603
<font color=1275ef>(THEODOR-ADORNO STRAUSS)</font>

01:35:12.235 --> 01:35:14.362
Why do you not talk to her?

01:35:14.779 --> 01:35:17.240
I... can't.

01:35:17.449 --> 01:35:18.867
You can.

01:35:24.205 --> 01:35:25.707
<font color=cyan>(Knowledge determines destiny)</font>

01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:27.709
It is a bit of a surprise.

01:35:27.709 --> 01:35:31.921
We expected his frequency
to be above average,

01:35:31.921 --> 01:35:38.261
but it is exactly average,
to 10 decimal places.

01:35:38.678 --> 01:35:42.432
The time has come for you
to learn some family history.

01:35:47.687 --> 01:35:50.064
So, why don't we tell them?

01:35:50.106 --> 01:35:53.443
Because the masses
prefer not to be self-aware,

01:35:53.568 --> 01:35:58.614
which by choice, puts them on a level
with all their cousins in the animal kingdom.

01:35:58.656 --> 01:36:00.450
Want some flakes?

01:36:02.618 --> 01:36:04.662
Say "Thank you".

01:36:14.338 --> 01:36:18.092
- Maybe this isn't your instrument.
- But it was perfect.

01:36:18.134 --> 01:36:19.969
Look, for hundreds of years,

01:36:19.969 --> 01:36:21.637
we have been the players, Theo,

01:36:21.637 --> 01:36:26.183
interpreting the score, evolving it.
Where's the life?

01:36:26.392 --> 01:36:28.019
Where's the inspiration?

01:36:28.102 --> 01:36:30.479
Where's the... spontaneity?

01:36:30.479 --> 01:36:33.941
If we are all machines,
then everything is decided.

01:36:33.983 --> 01:36:35.943
Spontaneity is an illusion.

01:36:35.943 --> 01:36:38.237
No. We still have free will.

01:36:38.237 --> 01:36:40.239
We still have souls.

01:36:40.239 --> 01:36:42.908
We still have imagination.

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.661
Theo, Zak's here.

01:36:48.831 --> 01:36:50.332
<font color=cyan>(Rule One)</font>

01:36:51.834 --> 01:36:52.960

01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:02.678
<font color=cyan>(Rule Seventeen)</font>

<font color=cyan>(Rule Thirty)</font>

01:37:29.079 --> 01:37:30.247
What is it?

01:37:30.247 --> 01:37:32.332
A code, I extrapolated from Mozart.

01:37:32.332 --> 01:37:35.294
It lays underneath
all his work, invisible.

01:37:35.544 --> 01:37:38.672
I thought all this time
you were writing music.

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:44.845
I-I believe it's the code to the-- that...
governs everything.

01:37:44.970 --> 01:37:48.849
This universe comes from
one simple code repeating infinitely,

01:37:48.849 --> 01:37:52.519
making it infinitely complex
but utterly predictable.

01:37:52.978 --> 01:37:56.606
But it's not perfect yet.
I-I'm still working on it.

01:37:56.606 --> 01:38:00.944
If this is real, then it assumes
that we are simply complex machines,

01:38:00.944 --> 01:38:04.030
that we may not have a soul,
certainly not any free will.

01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:06.950
I'm sorry.
Are they important?

01:38:07.158 --> 01:38:08.410
Okay.

01:38:08.410 --> 01:38:10.620
I'll go along with it for now.

01:38:10.745 --> 01:38:15.834
Though, if this is real, you'll be able to tell me
what's going to happen next, won't you?

01:38:16.042 --> 01:38:18.211
Just the next five minutes.

01:38:20.422 --> 01:38:23.091
<font color=cyan>(Experiment 0)
(Rule 30)</font>

01:38:52.787 --> 01:38:58.042
In about five seconds,
Nicola-Tesla's gonna come over.

01:39:04.215 --> 01:39:09.262
And in 31 seconds,
Zak is gonna cross the room.

01:39:09.512 --> 01:39:13.516
And in precisely two minutes,
The fire alarm's gonna sound.

01:39:21.941 --> 01:39:24.652
Two minutes. No alarm.

01:39:33.494 --> 01:39:38.249
- Two minutes, seven seconds.
- I told you, it's not perfected yet.

01:39:39.041 --> 01:39:40.751
You almost had me.

01:39:41.085 --> 01:39:44.046
I have a sense of humor
like everyone else, but I'm disappointed...

01:39:44.046 --> 01:39:49.343
that you've decided to play games
rather than taking this fair seriously.

01:39:54.139 --> 01:39:55.683
It's not a game.

01:39:59.728 --> 01:40:01.355
Thank you.

01:40:01.814 --> 01:40:04.275
Have a gift. Open it.

01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:11.240
I think you've been working too hard.

01:40:11.323 --> 01:40:14.535
You need a hobby, a pet.

01:40:15.911 --> 01:40:17.287
I quite agree.

01:40:18.288 --> 01:40:20.624
- Say "Thank you".
- Thank you.

01:40:20.666 --> 01:40:22.417
Oh, hey, it's me.

01:40:22.918 --> 01:40:26.046
Yeah, I'm thinking of having
a drinking session around 9:00 tonight.

01:40:26.046 --> 01:40:30.384
As usual, any assistance you can provide
would be gratefully appreciated.

01:40:30.467 --> 01:40:32.261
- Any change?
- Not yet.

01:40:32.261 --> 01:40:34.429
Give me another three.

01:40:40.352 --> 01:40:41.603
Sorry.

01:40:45.107 --> 01:40:47.651
I see you've taught him
some new tricks.

01:40:47.693 --> 01:40:51.238
- They're going to ask.
- Who? Ask what?

01:40:51.238 --> 01:40:52.698
Everyone.

01:40:52.864 --> 01:40:57.285
Ask... for our help from the book.

01:40:57.911 --> 01:41:02.958
And they're going to ask you specifically,
and you're going to tell them.

01:41:08.505 --> 01:41:13.301
I would say it was a gift, but it--
it really has nothing to do with me.

01:41:21.643 --> 01:41:24.145
Oh, turn off the music now.

01:41:27.774 --> 01:41:32.278
<font color=1275ef>(OXV)</font>

01:41:42.831 --> 01:41:45.416
Oh, sorry.
Sorry about that.

01:41:45.625 --> 01:41:51.756
Technology's never been my strongpoint,
but we're all getting used to this, aren't we?

01:41:52.131 --> 01:41:54.050
Your test results are back.

01:41:54.217 --> 01:41:56.844
Well, there's no need to worry,
either of you.

01:41:56.844 --> 01:42:00.473
It just means that we'll have to start
with stronger doses to begin with.

01:42:00.473 --> 01:42:04.268
Zak, this is a course of
Mozart and Brahms.

01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:07.522
Marie, Pachelbel, once daily.

01:42:11.651 --> 01:42:16.697
So... what I'm feeling now...

01:42:17.406 --> 01:42:18.991
is it real?

01:42:21.577 --> 01:42:28.334
From what we now know, what you feel
is not due to any form of manipulation,

01:42:28.668 --> 01:42:32.922
but further than that,
I-- I cannot comment.

01:42:34.173 --> 01:42:36.509
You're perfectly normal.

01:42:40.513 --> 01:42:42.181
For a machine.

01:42:47.186 --> 01:42:48.896
Nothing to say, father?

01:42:52.233 --> 01:42:56.445
If you're right, then you've seen
this conversation already.

01:42:56.529 --> 01:43:01.825
It's not physically possible for me
to watch every conversation, but... yes.

01:43:02.076 --> 01:43:04.870
You know precisely
what I'm going to say?

01:43:05.746 --> 01:43:06.872
Yes.

01:43:13.170 --> 01:43:15.631
Then tell me what happens.

01:43:20.552 --> 01:43:24.890
- So, how do you feel?
- Like the luckiest girl in the world.

01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:28.060
- You are the luckiest girl in the world.
- I was.

01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.023
What are you thinking?

01:43:33.232 --> 01:43:38.195
You're going to tell me that you don't think
I'll ever perfect the equation,

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:45.160
that free will is not an illusion,
that creativity and improvisation do exist.

01:43:45.285 --> 01:43:48.163
I-- I disagree with you.

01:43:48.622 --> 01:43:53.585
But I'm not interested
in individual destinies.

01:43:53.585 --> 01:43:59.883
What I am interested in
is the universal... symphony.

01:44:00.008 --> 01:44:03.303
You always got whatever
it was you wanted, didn't you?

01:44:03.553 --> 01:44:05.972
And what was it you wanted
more than anything else in the world?

01:44:06.014 --> 01:44:07.808
Feelings.

01:44:08.016 --> 01:44:09.810
To be in love.

01:44:11.436 --> 01:44:15.065
So, what are you saying--
that nature created you for me,

01:44:15.106 --> 01:44:17.692
someone to give me what I wanted?

01:44:17.984 --> 01:44:21.696
I tell you that
when the equation is perfect,

01:44:21.696 --> 01:44:23.823
I will know the true pattern.

01:44:24.574 --> 01:44:27.035
You ask me what good that will do.

01:44:27.035 --> 01:44:32.832
I tell you, "Knowledge is useless
if you only know parts--

01:44:33.124 --> 01:44:36.086
There can be no truth.

01:44:36.336 --> 01:44:39.464
Everyone else will know only pieces.

01:44:39.714 --> 01:44:43.968
Only I will know... everything."

01:44:48.932 --> 01:44:51.100
That would mean
neither of us had a choice.

01:44:51.434 --> 01:44:54.395
You ask me if I don't miss surprises.

01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:00.234
I tell you that although
I might get the score,

01:45:00.610 --> 01:45:04.739
there is still the joy
in watching the performance.

01:45:30.264 --> 01:45:32.808
This is the part
where I say goodbye, isn't it?

01:45:33.684 --> 01:45:35.228
Yes.

01:45:36.395 --> 01:45:37.647
Hello.

01:45:40.191 --> 01:45:41.275
Hello.

01:45:42.318 --> 01:45:43.486
Goodbye.

01:45:44.779 --> 01:45:46.322
Goodbye.

01:45:52.787 --> 01:45:53.996
If you're right...

01:45:53.996 --> 01:45:59.752
If I'm right, it means that whatever
gave us our minute wasn't love...

01:46:00.336 --> 01:46:02.046
It was fate.

01:46:04.590 --> 01:46:08.385
It means I'm just here
to serve a purpose for you.

01:46:09.011 --> 01:46:11.472
It means everything's already decided.

01:46:11.513 --> 01:46:13.682
There's no freedom, no responsibility,

01:46:13.682 --> 01:46:17.936
and knowledge absolutely
does not determine destiny.

01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:19.063
Yes.

01:46:23.192 --> 01:46:25.110
Does it matter?

01:46:28.739 --> 01:46:31.366
No. Not to me.

01:46:32.367 --> 01:46:33.911
Me neither.

01:46:55.682 --> 01:46:57.225
That's it.

01:46:59.644 --> 01:47:01.146
Perfect.

01:47:06.818 --> 01:47:09.988
I see.
