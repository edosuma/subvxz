WEBVTT

00:01.855 --> 00:03.278
Previously on 2 Broke Girls...

00:03.279 --> 00:06.399
Oh, no, Max! My wallet! It's gone.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.776
All of our cash and our
credit cards were in there.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.238
I need to get to Texas
to see my boyfriend.

00:12.239 --> 00:14.507
There has got to be a way
we can work something out.

00:14.508 --> 00:16.041
We'll do anything.

00:19.979 --> 00:22.348
Just another lonely
night here in Texas...

00:22.349 --> 00:23.983
with all my new best friends!

00:23.984 --> 00:25.785
Ha-ha!

00:25.786 --> 00:28.655
I'm driving to Texas
if y'all want a ride.

00:28.656 --> 00:29.989
Shotgun! I'm sitting

00:29.990 --> 00:31.090
next to RuPaul.

00:31.091 --> 00:32.491
No. I'm sitting next to RuPaul!

00:35.496 --> 00:37.597
All right.

00:37.598 --> 00:40.633
So, this is where Randy and the
other movie people are staying.

00:40.634 --> 00:43.402
He's been here. I smell abs.

00:44.504 --> 00:46.706
Ugh, I smell us.

00:46.707 --> 00:49.108
When did I have a hot dog?

00:49.109 --> 00:51.978
I shared one with you while you
were sleeping. You're welcome.

00:51.979 --> 00:54.147
Let's ask that clerk if he's seen Randy,

00:54.148 --> 00:56.815
and when the outdoor sprinklers
go on so we can freshen up.

00:59.485 --> 01:01.487
Hi. How can I help you?

01:01.488 --> 01:03.523
B-T-dubs, if you're
going for that tossled,

01:03.524 --> 01:04.867
just-crawled-out-of-a-ditch look,

01:04.867 --> 01:06.459
you nailed it.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.895
I'm not gonna ask what
you just crawled out of,

01:08.896 --> 01:10.595
because I'm too tired to be mean.

01:11.965 --> 01:15.034
So, Richie,

01:15.035 --> 01:16.669
my associate and I would like to know

01:16.670 --> 01:18.738
what room Randy Walsh is staying in.

01:18.739 --> 01:22.241
And I see you have a very
strict "no pets" policy.

01:22.242 --> 01:25.011
Yes, Randy Walsh's room. Of course.

01:25.012 --> 01:26.913
Looks like he is in room number...

01:26.914 --> 01:29.257
what hotel clerk in the world
would give out a guest's info

01:29.258 --> 01:30.891
to two dusty randos?

01:31.684 --> 01:34.554
Um, I'm more than just a dusty rando.

01:34.555 --> 01:36.689
I'm his dusty ex-girlfriend.

01:36.690 --> 01:38.558
Also, well played.

01:38.559 --> 01:40.493
He has friend potential.

01:40.494 --> 01:41.761
Not helpful friend.

01:41.762 --> 01:44.263
Just "tell you what not to wear" friend.

01:44.264 --> 01:46.899
Well, it's still early, so
hopefully Randy hasn't left...

01:46.900 --> 01:48.234
oh, my God, free cookies!

01:48.235 --> 01:51.270
And cucumber water!

01:51.271 --> 01:52.939
With berries!

01:52.940 --> 01:55.241
My nanny used to make me water like this

01:55.242 --> 01:58.044
before the town car would
take me to preschool.

01:58.045 --> 01:59.579
You had a town car?

01:59.580 --> 02:01.447
My mom was called the town car.

02:01.448 --> 02:03.048
She sat four comfortably.

02:04.851 --> 02:07.453
Can't believe I have to take
a van to set with other people.

02:07.454 --> 02:09.422
I was in Speed.

02:09.423 --> 02:11.290
You were on speed.

02:11.291 --> 02:13.026
And you were in rehab.

02:13.027 --> 02:14.394
And then I rebuilt your career,

02:14.395 --> 02:16.362
and now you have to take a van.

02:16.363 --> 02:19.465
Max, look! It's Randy.

02:19.466 --> 02:21.934
And that guy from the
reverse mortgage commercials.

02:21.935 --> 02:23.703
Ugh! Oh, God!

02:23.704 --> 02:25.571
He can't see me all gross like this.

02:25.572 --> 02:27.073
I thought your grossness is

02:27.074 --> 02:28.908
one of the things he likes about you.

02:28.909 --> 02:31.610
Mm, it's complicated. He
likes me to start out clean.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074

02:40.054 --> 02:46.172
_ _

02:55.907 --> 02:57.474
I am getting really good

02:57.475 --> 02:59.810
at bathing in public restrooms.

02:59.811 --> 03:01.946
And I want it to end!

03:01.947 --> 03:04.582
Well, your hobo skills are not complete.

03:04.583 --> 03:06.183
You need to practice peeing in an alley.

03:06.207 --> 03:07.787
You're still splashing on your shoes.

03:09.553 --> 03:11.129
Now come on. Let's go find Randy.

03:11.130 --> 03:12.864
Fine. Let's go ask that concierge

03:12.865 --> 03:15.233
if he knows where it is.

03:15.234 --> 03:16.534
Hey, remember us?

03:16.535 --> 03:18.069
The dust bunnies from before?

03:18.070 --> 03:19.804
I know who you are.

03:19.805 --> 03:22.907
I've been following you
two around with a wet vac.

03:22.908 --> 03:24.742
Bit of an attitude
from someone who's got

03:24.743 --> 03:26.710
two giant horns coming out of his head.

03:28.580 --> 03:31.850
You're bringing horny
to a whole new level.

03:31.851 --> 03:34.152
Can you please tell us
where the movie set is?

03:34.153 --> 03:36.488
Oh, of course. Absolutely. No problem.

03:36.489 --> 03:38.823
Just go out the lobby, make
a left on Main, then a right

03:38.824 --> 03:41.659
on There's No Way In Hell
I'm Telling You That Street.

03:41.660 --> 03:43.194
Uh, was that a left or a right

03:43.195 --> 03:45.095
on No Way In Hell I'm
Telling You That Street?

03:46.331 --> 03:47.999
Look. My friend came all the way here

03:48.000 --> 03:49.567
to surprise her boyfriend.

03:49.568 --> 03:51.369
How would you feel
if someone stopped you

03:51.370 --> 03:53.403
from seeing your boyfriend?

03:56.274 --> 03:58.576
Excuse me? Boyfriend?

03:58.577 --> 04:00.345
I'm not gay.

04:00.346 --> 04:03.781
This is Texas, not the
Flaming Saddles Saloon

04:03.782 --> 04:06.383
on 9th Avenue and 52nd
Street in New York City.

04:09.087 --> 04:11.389
Where you've definitely never been.

04:11.390 --> 04:13.858
Please just leave my lobby, all right?

04:13.859 --> 04:15.420
There's enough sad wannabes around here

04:15.421 --> 04:16.483
with the extras casting...

04:16.485 --> 04:17.562
which reminds me

04:17.563 --> 04:20.365
I need to get to extras casting.

04:20.366 --> 04:22.934
We don't need him, Max.
I have a great idea.

04:22.935 --> 04:25.537
We'll get cast as
extras in Randy's movie.

04:25.538 --> 04:26.804
That way you can see him,

04:26.805 --> 04:29.040
and audiences everywhere can see me.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.709
Ah, Caroline, that's genius!

04:31.710 --> 04:33.211
While we're waiting, I'll call Han

04:33.212 --> 04:34.979
to check on the dessert bar's progress.

04:34.980 --> 04:39.951
Wow. I have an acting career
and I own a dessert bar.

04:39.952 --> 04:42.053
And to think just moments ago

04:42.054 --> 04:45.957
I was tossing water from
a sink to my privates.

04:45.958 --> 04:48.959
Can you call it a whore's
bath if you never have sex?

04:51.596 --> 04:53.798
Can you please tell
them to keep it down?

04:53.799 --> 04:56.000
A simple "no" would've done.

04:56.001 --> 04:58.335
You don't have to insult my sweater!

04:59.604 --> 05:02.240
And hello, Max.

05:05.244 --> 05:07.145
There's more banging going on in there

05:07.146 --> 05:10.114
than season one of The Affair.

05:10.115 --> 05:13.651
It's really ruining the
fine dining ambiance in here.

05:13.652 --> 05:15.653
What's that, doc?

05:15.654 --> 05:18.690
Is it on my testicle or just near it?

05:19.692 --> 05:21.459
Come on!

05:23.429 --> 05:25.997
And now they woke up Barbara.

05:25.998 --> 05:29.133
And I don't have the DVD
of Amy Adams' last movie

05:29.134 --> 05:31.936
to put her back to sleep.

05:31.937 --> 05:34.872
That's the last straw.
I'm going over there.

05:34.873 --> 05:38.676
I can't stand the
sound of a crying baby.

05:38.677 --> 05:41.679
That's why I'm waiting a
couple years to have my own.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.948
Hey! Oleg.

05:43.949 --> 05:47.385
Come on. Your daughter just got
woken up with that heavy noise.

05:47.386 --> 05:49.487
You should be going over there.

05:49.488 --> 05:51.556
Uh, I'm kind of in the middle of taking

05:51.557 --> 05:55.893
a "Which Friends
character are you?" quiz.

05:55.894 --> 05:58.563
Ross?

05:58.564 --> 06:02.367
Well, maybe you should be
doing some more manly things

06:02.368 --> 06:04.669
so that when Barbara sees your picture,

06:04.670 --> 06:07.037
she doesn't say "Mama."

06:08.706 --> 06:11.342
She calls me Mama?

06:11.343 --> 06:12.877
I'm going over there.

06:12.878 --> 06:15.679
I'm not Mama. I'm Dadushki!

06:17.148 --> 06:19.116
You're being a da-douche-ski.

06:22.253 --> 06:24.188
James jostled Gene gently.

06:24.189 --> 06:25.723
James jostled Gene gently.

06:25.724 --> 06:27.258
James jostled Gene...

06:27.259 --> 06:30.161
Somebody help. I think
my robot's broken.

06:30.162 --> 06:32.196
It's an acting exercise, Max.

06:32.197 --> 06:33.731
It stretches out the mouth.

06:33.732 --> 06:36.233
Uh, I think all those
teeth do the trick.

06:38.870 --> 06:40.538
I just want to be prepared.

06:40.539 --> 06:43.875
I mean, maybe I'm not just
on this journey for you.

06:43.876 --> 06:46.444
Maybe I'm supposed to be
discovered as an actress.

06:46.445 --> 06:49.747
Maybe something's finally about me.

06:49.748 --> 06:52.750
Everything is always about you.

06:52.751 --> 06:55.752
You call Christmas "The
Day Caroline Gets Presents."

06:57.689 --> 07:00.758
And we're only auditioning so I
can get to the set to see Randy.

07:00.759 --> 07:02.126
Not for your acting career.

07:02.127 --> 07:04.696
Also, you don't have an acting career.

07:04.697 --> 07:06.764
Well, shouldn't you be practicing

07:06.765 --> 07:08.599
what you're gonna say to Randy?

07:08.600 --> 07:11.436
I mean, your original
plan to "jump Dem bones"

07:11.437 --> 07:13.204
might not fly on a movie set.

07:13.205 --> 07:16.107
Hey! I got words.

07:16.108 --> 07:19.243
I was thinking something
along the lines of,

07:19.244 --> 07:22.213
"Howdy, Dude-y."

07:22.214 --> 07:23.781
You know, 'cause we're in Texas

07:23.782 --> 07:25.982
and he was kind of a
doody for blocking me.

07:27.285 --> 07:29.620
Okay, extras, since
this is a zombie movie,

07:29.621 --> 07:31.723
I'm gonna need to see
you act like zombies.

07:31.724 --> 07:34.591
But don't touch me. My entire
body's an erogenous zone.

07:35.827 --> 07:38.162
Zombies? I didn't prepare for that.

07:38.163 --> 07:40.898
You also didn't prepare for
being a celibate poor person,

07:40.899 --> 07:42.599
but you're knocking
that out of the park.

07:46.371 --> 07:47.071
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

07:53.695 --> 07:56.197
Excuse me, sir...

07:56.198 --> 07:58.031
if that is your real name.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.635
We're from the diner next door,

08:00.636 --> 08:02.703
and you need to keep the noise down.

08:02.704 --> 08:04.138
It woke up a baby

08:04.139 --> 08:06.340
and the man who lives in booth two.

08:06.341 --> 08:08.342
Sorry for the loud noise.

08:08.343 --> 08:10.645
If there's one thing
New York's known for,

08:10.646 --> 08:12.146
it's quiet construction.

08:12.147 --> 08:14.682
Listen. You may think you're

08:14.683 --> 08:16.517
some sort of authority figure

08:16.518 --> 08:18.553
with that tank top,

08:18.554 --> 08:19.887
but you're not.

08:19.888 --> 08:22.356
What you are is fired.

08:22.357 --> 08:24.658
Was anyone recording
that for baby Barbara?

08:26.360 --> 08:28.229
Well, that escalated rather quickly.

08:28.230 --> 08:32.200
Take your gorgeous tank top

08:32.201 --> 08:34.368
and get the hell out of here.

08:34.369 --> 08:36.304
Fine. I don't need this.

08:36.304 --> 08:38.672
My dance company got
a grant from Pfizer.

08:41.308 --> 08:43.144
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

08:43.145 --> 08:45.313
Not a door.

08:45.314 --> 08:46.981
The girls are gonna kill me

08:46.982 --> 08:49.550
if they get back and the
dessert bar isn't finished.

08:49.551 --> 08:51.185
Well, Oleg will do it.

08:51.186 --> 08:53.186
He says he can nail anything.

08:54.255 --> 08:56.424
I was talking about Jersey skanks,

08:56.425 --> 08:58.024
but sure, I'll give it a try.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.431
You're in.

09:03.432 --> 09:04.999
Go wait next to the corpse extras.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.234
Next.

09:06.235 --> 09:08.402
Hi. My name is Caroline Channing,

09:08.403 --> 09:10.504
and I will be singing "Hamilton"

09:10.505 --> 09:13.107
from the musical of the same name.

09:13.108 --> 09:15.176
Hold off on that.

09:15.177 --> 09:17.143
I'm not quite ready to kill myself.

09:18.846 --> 09:21.716
Are you sure you don't
have any non-zombie parts?

09:21.717 --> 09:23.050
Maybe a cheerleader?

09:23.051 --> 09:25.353
Or a socialite who lost all her money

09:25.354 --> 09:27.588
but not her looks or
her will to succeed?

09:27.589 --> 09:29.724
But she has lost everyone's interest.

09:29.725 --> 09:31.525
Uh, fine.

09:31.526 --> 09:34.327
Here we go with a zombie.

09:37.766 --> 09:40.767
Here I come! I'm a zombie!

09:42.803 --> 09:44.772
God, I want to go back
to casting commercials

09:44.773 --> 09:46.274
for Applebee's.

09:46.275 --> 09:48.141
You just have to be
white and a little fat.

09:49.477 --> 09:54.848
Or I can do... mow mow mow mow mow!

09:56.617 --> 09:58.752
Not a zombie. Not anything.

09:59.921 --> 10:01.956
Hey, are those sodas up for grabs?

10:01.957 --> 10:02.957
Yeah.

10:02.958 --> 10:05.191
Oh-ho! Root beer!

10:06.894 --> 10:08.796
Now, that's a zombie!

10:08.797 --> 10:11.165
Amazing walk and moan. You're hired.

10:12.167 --> 10:13.401
What?

10:13.402 --> 10:15.102
But she's not an actor.

10:15.103 --> 10:17.738
She can't even pretend
to laugh at my jokes.

10:20.641 --> 10:21.742
You thought that was funny?

10:21.743 --> 10:23.811
No! Boo.

10:23.812 --> 10:26.180
Bad news, Bon Bon: I can't
be in your movie today.

10:26.181 --> 10:28.249
Carlos won't work my shift at the desk.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.984
We broke...

10:29.985 --> 10:31.451
we had a fight.

10:38.192 --> 10:40.261
Looks like you got the part.

10:40.262 --> 10:42.830
Congratulations on me
running out of people.

10:42.831 --> 10:44.332
All right, everyone on the van.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.133
We got to get you to set and makeup.

10:46.134 --> 10:47.501
Oh, wait, Bonnie. Am I going with,

10:47.502 --> 10:48.936
"Here I come. I'm a zombie."

10:48.937 --> 10:51.137
or "mow, mow, mow, mow,
mow, mow, mow, mow"?

10:53.207 --> 10:54.407
They're both good.

11:02.817 --> 11:05.186
Why do you get to be a hot zombie?

11:05.187 --> 11:07.654
I look like dead David Spade.

11:09.390 --> 11:11.459
So, David Spade?

11:11.460 --> 11:15.062
And I have this gross
axe wound in my neck.

11:15.063 --> 11:17.231
Oh, I thought that was a second mouth.

11:17.232 --> 11:19.135
I was worried it was
gonna start telling stories

11:19.136 --> 11:21.235
about how rich it used to be.

11:21.236 --> 11:23.671
I've been working on
my zombie's backstory.

11:23.672 --> 11:25.673
She's a teacher named Jill

11:25.674 --> 11:27.641
with an online gambling addiction

11:27.642 --> 11:30.877
and an interest in women
she's never acted on.

11:32.646 --> 11:36.417
So, as your lawyer, can
you please stop asking me

11:36.418 --> 11:38.185
for a drunk driver's license?

11:38.186 --> 11:40.321
It's not a real thing.

11:40.322 --> 11:42.423
Neither is a cocaine permit.

11:42.424 --> 11:45.026
Oh, my God, it's Randy. Hide! Hide!

11:45.027 --> 11:47.094
Hide? Like Jill is
doing with her feelings

11:47.095 --> 11:48.461
for her neighbor Sarah?

11:49.830 --> 11:51.932
Will you run lines with me?

11:51.933 --> 11:53.501
Sure.

11:53.502 --> 11:55.485
You want to take it from,
"You can take my brains,

11:55.486 --> 11:58.105
but you can't take my freedom"?

11:58.106 --> 11:59.907
Max, we came all this way.

11:59.908 --> 12:02.009
You can't just avoid him forever.

12:02.010 --> 12:04.945
He's not a Hulu original.

12:04.946 --> 12:07.014
Just go tell him what you want.

12:07.015 --> 12:08.416
And what do you want?

12:08.417 --> 12:10.351
Are you planning on moving to LA?

12:10.352 --> 12:12.453
Because when this
acting thing takes off,

12:12.454 --> 12:14.388
they'll want me to live there, too.

12:14.389 --> 12:15.523
Who's "they"?

12:15.524 --> 12:17.591
Is "they" all of New York?

12:17.592 --> 12:19.460
Oi! Drop the brains,

12:19.461 --> 12:21.094
you zombie scum!

12:22.863 --> 12:25.665
Yeah, the script says
"brightly," not "British."

12:27.368 --> 12:29.303
I mean, I can't move to LA.

12:29.304 --> 12:32.106
We've worked too hard getting
the dessert bar to where it is.

12:32.107 --> 12:34.275
I can be happy with
the long-distance thing.

12:34.276 --> 12:36.110
I mean, it's better than nothing,

12:36.111 --> 12:38.546
and I don't have to shave as much.

12:38.547 --> 12:41.048
Well, none of that's A-material,

12:41.049 --> 12:42.450
but it's how you feel,

12:42.451 --> 12:44.951
so just go tell him
before he goes off again.

12:45.986 --> 12:47.621
I'm pushing you with my stub.

12:47.622 --> 12:49.656
All right. All right. I'm going.

12:51.225 --> 12:54.261
Just to make sure he recognizes me.

12:54.262 --> 12:57.598
Here you are. You two wander off
more than my stepson's left eye.

12:57.599 --> 12:59.266
You're late for your scene.

12:59.267 --> 13:02.069
Um, I just need two minutes
with that guy who just left,

13:02.070 --> 13:04.004
and a condom if you have one on you.

13:04.005 --> 13:06.674
What do I look like? The sound guy?

13:06.675 --> 13:08.642
Uh, and I'm gonna need
you to zip that dress up.

13:08.643 --> 13:09.777
This movie's PG.

13:09.778 --> 13:11.512
All right, I'll zip up.

13:11.513 --> 13:13.380
Guess you guys don't want a sequel.

13:24.192 --> 13:28.173
There. The door, much
like the man who put it up,

13:28.174 --> 13:30.736
is well hung.

13:30.737 --> 13:32.062
Have you ever done anything

13:32.063 --> 13:34.231
without bringing up your penis size?

13:34.232 --> 13:36.900
Sure. My driver's test.

13:36.901 --> 13:38.301
Oh, wait. No.

13:39.636 --> 13:42.339
Han, hey, just a heads up.

13:42.340 --> 13:47.244
Man, there's literally no one
working in your diner right now.

13:47.245 --> 13:50.180
And that's unusual how?

13:50.181 --> 13:53.850
Well, since I don't have to be
at work, I am going on a break,

13:53.851 --> 13:55.686
which means smoking a J

13:55.687 --> 13:57.520
and taking a nap in the trunk of my car.

13:59.289 --> 14:01.123
He doesn't even have a car.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.134
How about that?

14:11.135 --> 14:12.535
Earl has superpowers.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.005
The only superpowers he has

14:15.006 --> 14:16.740
is that he's still alive.

14:16.741 --> 14:19.008
Hey, what's going on here?

14:21.144 --> 14:23.013
Fine. The jig is up.

14:23.014 --> 14:25.015
I can't hang a door.

14:25.016 --> 14:27.351
Sophie, my daughter
may think I'm a mama,

14:27.352 --> 14:29.486
but I don't want her
to think I'm a liar.

14:29.487 --> 14:32.956
Ooh. This went from zero
to Lifetime pretty quickly.

14:32.957 --> 14:34.958
I'm out.

14:34.959 --> 14:38.562
Oh, Oleg,

14:38.563 --> 14:40.864
come on... it doesn't matter

14:40.865 --> 14:44.501
that you can't build
anything or protect us

14:44.502 --> 14:46.736
or... or... or be a man.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.108
What's really important

14:51.109 --> 14:53.510
is how much you love Barbara.

14:53.511 --> 14:57.047
But she thinks I'm a mama.

14:57.048 --> 15:00.383
Well, she also thinks that
Danny Glover is the president.

15:02.386 --> 15:04.087
Dadushki!

15:04.088 --> 15:06.790
Oh, my gosh, Oleg, did you hear that?

15:06.791 --> 15:08.558
Yeah. You just said it.

15:08.559 --> 15:11.228
No. No, no, no. It was Barbara.

15:11.229 --> 15:13.597
Barbara just called you Dadushki.

15:13.598 --> 15:14.964
She did?

15:17.034 --> 15:18.802
Papa.

15:18.803 --> 15:22.039
"Papa"? What the hell is that?

15:22.040 --> 15:24.574
Eh, she's not very bright.

15:24.575 --> 15:28.145
But thank God she's
pretty like her mamas.

15:35.118 --> 15:37.454
Ugh, my gash is itchy.

15:37.455 --> 15:39.756
You should see someone about that.

15:39.757 --> 15:42.392
Ugh! This is one of the
least comfortable harnesses

15:42.393 --> 15:44.428
I've ever hung from.

15:44.429 --> 15:47.230
On the upside, it's
currently rounding third base.

15:47.231 --> 15:48.565
Jealous!

15:48.566 --> 15:52.035
Oh, Richie! How did you get here?

15:52.036 --> 15:53.737
I thought you had to work.

15:53.738 --> 15:55.372
Not that acting isn't work.

15:55.373 --> 15:58.475
Just act my fellow
thespian, Natalie Portman.

15:58.476 --> 16:00.744
You look like a thespian in that shirt.

16:00.745 --> 16:02.879
Funny story: I actually got here

16:02.880 --> 16:05.182
on the None of Your Beeswax Express.

16:05.183 --> 16:06.883
Ha! He did it again.

16:06.884 --> 16:08.651
Turns out it doesn't get old.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.123
Okay, zombies. Three
minutes till we shoot.

16:13.124 --> 16:15.092
Let me see you wriggle and moan.

16:15.093 --> 16:17.761
Mow, mow, mow, mow.

16:17.762 --> 16:21.031
Bonnie, am I moaning
because I am horrified

16:21.032 --> 16:22.799
at what I've become?

16:22.800 --> 16:25.334
Or because I'm in pain from
hanging on this meat hook?

16:28.071 --> 16:30.340
She must be going to ask the director.

16:30.341 --> 16:32.274
Here comes Randy. How do I look?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.912
Like a piece of meat.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.012
I'll take it.

16:38.749 --> 16:40.917
You were hilarious in that last scene.

16:40.918 --> 16:43.387
I think everybody's really happy
they didn't get Eddie Murphy.

16:43.388 --> 16:45.288
Eddie Murphy?

16:45.289 --> 16:47.957
I was wondering why I had to
play my whole family at dinner.

16:52.396 --> 16:54.898
This is a comedy?

16:54.899 --> 16:57.100
Well, it's a good
thing I'm so versatile.

16:57.101 --> 16:59.503
I think I'll make Jill clumsy.

16:59.504 --> 17:02.105
Ugh! Where'd they go?

17:02.106 --> 17:05.342
Yeah, meditation has totally changed me.

17:05.343 --> 17:06.943
I'm not as angry.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.410
Hey! Don't look at me!

17:09.913 --> 17:12.516
Yeah, you do seem calmer.

17:12.517 --> 17:14.751
I wonder why they demanded
your lawyer be on set.

17:14.752 --> 17:16.752
Dude, when we get back to LA,

17:16.753 --> 17:18.416
there's someone I want
to set you up with.

17:18.417 --> 17:20.589
Oh... I need to hear this. Push me.

17:20.590 --> 17:24.161
She's hot. But I'm
just not dating anyone

17:24.162 --> 17:25.996
who drives a Prius right now.

17:25.997 --> 17:27.696
I don't know.

17:27.698 --> 17:29.266
I'm in a weird place right now,

17:29.267 --> 17:31.201
and I don't just mean Texas.

17:31.202 --> 17:33.737
You're not still seeing that
girl in New York, are you?

17:33.738 --> 17:36.706
What girl in New York?

17:36.707 --> 17:38.775
Me!

17:38.776 --> 17:40.143
Did your brain get eaten already,

17:40.144 --> 17:42.145
or is Jill just an idiot?

17:42.146 --> 17:43.547
She is just overwhelmed.

17:43.548 --> 17:45.282
She has three kids under the age of five

17:45.283 --> 17:46.515
and car trouble.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.486
We broke up.

17:49.487 --> 17:50.854
We were Facetiming so much

17:50.855 --> 17:52.789
I felt like I was dating my iPhone.

17:52.790 --> 17:54.810
The other night at dinner,
we split an appetizer.

17:57.060 --> 17:58.227
Play dead!

17:59.529 --> 18:01.364
Yeah, Max is incredible,

18:01.365 --> 18:04.167
but we're just in
different places right now.

18:04.168 --> 18:06.035
- No, you're not.
- Shh!

18:09.372 --> 18:11.035
I wish I could say
the long distance thing

18:11.036 --> 18:12.242
was gonna be enough for me,

18:12.243 --> 18:14.678
but it wasn't... it
wasn't ever gonna be.

18:14.679 --> 18:16.279
It just can't be enough.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.114
Like you with compliments
about your hair.

18:19.450 --> 18:21.618
You like it, though, right?

18:21.619 --> 18:25.055
You know, I'm doing everything
I can to get over her.

18:25.056 --> 18:27.924
Blocked her on my
phone, went to therapy,

18:27.925 --> 18:30.961
watched all 13 seasons
of Grey's Anatomy,

18:30.962 --> 18:33.697
then realized I'd only watched
20 minutes of one episode.

18:33.698 --> 18:37.200
So, yes or no on my hair?

18:37.201 --> 18:39.169
It's great.

18:39.170 --> 18:41.771
But I'm not ready to meet that
girl with the Prius just yet.

18:41.772 --> 18:46.042
I mean, I'm all for good gas mileage.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.176
Just not yet.

18:48.712 --> 18:51.081
I get it. You're gay now.

18:51.082 --> 18:52.948
I wish!

19:09.866 --> 19:12.269
All right, two minutes, everybody.

19:12.270 --> 19:15.437
Let's do this thing quick,
'cause this movie sucks.

19:16.973 --> 19:18.708
Max, why didn't you say something?

19:18.709 --> 19:20.377
That was your chance.

19:20.378 --> 19:23.880
Ugh, you heard what he
said to that fake sheriff.

19:23.881 --> 19:25.749
The long distance thing
isn't enough for him,

19:25.750 --> 19:27.217
and he needs to move on.

19:27.218 --> 19:29.386
It's only fair that I let him.

19:29.387 --> 19:31.821
Call me stupid for being a romantic

19:31.822 --> 19:33.623
and thinking love could conquer all.

19:33.624 --> 19:34.890
Stupid!

19:38.862 --> 19:40.362
I'm sorry, Max.

19:42.632 --> 19:44.067
What are you doing?

19:44.068 --> 19:46.002
Do you have to pee?

19:46.003 --> 19:47.844
Because I find if you
go in your pants a little

19:47.845 --> 19:49.308
and then a little and then a little,

19:49.309 --> 19:50.473
it's not that noticeable.

19:50.474 --> 19:52.142
I was gonna give you a hug.

19:52.143 --> 19:54.243
Mm. All right, bring it in.

20:00.183 --> 20:02.719
Ahh.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.589
- You okay?
- No.

20:05.590 --> 20:07.324
My relationship is really over,

20:07.325 --> 20:09.626
and I'm starting to lose
feeling in my downstairs.

20:09.627 --> 20:11.328
Yeah.

20:11.329 --> 20:13.964
Ugh. I'm sorry I dragged
you across the country.

20:13.965 --> 20:17.934
You didn't drag me anywhere.
I wanted to be here with you.

20:17.935 --> 20:19.636
Let's go home, Max.

20:19.637 --> 20:21.171
I'll tell Bonnie we're quitting,

20:21.172 --> 20:23.440
and we'll tell the
press it was exhaustion.

20:23.441 --> 20:25.575
No. We're not going anywhere yet.

20:25.576 --> 20:27.439
We came all this way.
At least one of us should

20:27.440 --> 20:28.445
get what they want.

20:28.446 --> 20:29.946
You are gonna be in this movie.

20:29.947 --> 20:32.616
Max!

20:32.617 --> 20:35.285
I won't forget about you when I'm big.

20:35.286 --> 20:37.786
I mean, I'll definitely see you less.

20:39.522 --> 20:41.558
What's that? Get rid
of the blonde zombie?

20:41.559 --> 20:42.525
Oh, thank God.

20:42.526 --> 20:44.461
What? Why?

20:44.462 --> 20:46.696
Was it my "mow, mow, mow, mow"?

20:46.697 --> 20:50.066
Bonnie, wait. I... I can also write.

20:50.067 --> 20:51.201
Check this line out:

20:51.202 --> 20:53.135
"freezed to meet you."

20:54.938 --> 20:57.507
Cut me down, Bon Bon.
You can't split us up.

20:57.508 --> 20:58.707
Believe me. I've tried.
