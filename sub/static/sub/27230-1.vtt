WEBVTT

01:01.603 --> 01:03.480
[snarling]

01:03.563 --> 01:05.482
[zapping]

01:09.235 --> 01:11.863
Hold it, I'm getting all shook up!

01:12.614 --> 01:14.657
I don't really sound like that,
do I, Bae Bae?

01:14.741 --> 01:15.575
[Bae Bae grunts]

01:16.993 --> 01:18.995
[computers beeping]

01:29.172 --> 01:33.259
You know, back on the colony,
Luca and I didn't always get along.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.055
But despite that, I always respected Luca.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.809
She had an inner strength
that many did not

01:41.059 --> 01:44.187
and a desire to be a part
of something greater than herself.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.274
If she was so desperate
for something to believe in,

01:48.358 --> 01:51.027
it may have made her susceptible
to being manipulated.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.281
All right, that's all of it.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.451
Here's all our family recipes.

01:58.660 --> 02:02.163
And this is something special
just for you.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.164
[sniffs]

02:03.248 --> 02:05.416
Banana cake.
Mom, you're the best!

02:06.000 --> 02:08.837
Well, your father and I
are just so proud of you,

02:08.920 --> 02:10.547
saving the universe and all.

02:11.965 --> 02:12.799
We love you.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.931
[Hunk] Launching tomorrow.

02:20.431 --> 02:21.307
The big day.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.435
It seems like it was forever ago
when we piled into the Blue Lion

02:24.519 --> 02:25.937
and blasted out into space.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.523
Man, we had no idea
what we were getting into!

02:29.149 --> 02:29.983
Yeah.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.777
But now it's different.
We've seen it all.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.947
We're rugged veterans now,
going back into battle one last time.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.740
Mm, yup.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.701
Guess that makes us heroes or something?

02:40.243 --> 02:43.204
Like the type of heroes that would have
their own TV show! [laughs]

02:43.288 --> 02:46.249
Did you watch it, Lance?
Ah, it's so cool! It's so cool.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.919
They got you spot-on, but Coran is like,
he's all superserious and stuff.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.213
And Allura is a little...
I don't know, she's different.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.174
Keith is friendly! [laughs]
He's happy all the time.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.343
I mean, they got it so wrong.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.096
Plus, they're hinting at some romance
between him and Allura.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.014
What?!

03:01.222 --> 03:02.265
Keith and Allura?

03:02.557 --> 03:04.601
No, it should be Lance and Allura!

03:04.684 --> 03:08.062
Ooh, a love triangle.
I like where you're taking this.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.648
No, no. It's not about that.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.150
Wait, that's right.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.068
You said you were gonna ask Allura
on a date.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.613
You asked her, didn't you?
Oh, and she said no.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.156
[laughs] Oh. Oh, man.

03:18.239 --> 03:21.993
-Here I am, rubbing your face in it.
-She didn't say no. I...

03:22.994 --> 03:24.537
Well, I never asked her.

03:25.204 --> 03:26.247
You chickened out?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.582
I was going to ask her,

03:27.665 --> 03:30.418
but she's been spending, like,
every day in the med bay.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.796
Maybe--
Maybe this just isn't the right time.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.716
No, Lance. What?
It's the only time.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.010
After tomorrow, we're back in space
fighting the Galra.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.012
There is no other time, literally.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.681
You're asking her today,
and that is final, young man.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.812
Everyone, welcome to our final briefing
here on Earth.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.440
It's been several months
since we began to rebuild,

03:52.523 --> 03:55.485
and tomorrow we launch
and continue our liberation efforts

03:55.568 --> 03:57.862
across all planets still under Galra rule.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.531
Commander Holt,
what's the latest from your team?

04:00.698 --> 04:02.742
We've confirmed
that there's still no Galra activity

04:02.825 --> 04:04.744
within several galaxies of the Milky Way.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.913
It appears Earth was Sendak's only target.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.040
Where are we with Earth's defenses?

04:09.123 --> 04:12.126
I've finished my check-in with all
the garrison facilities around the globe.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.544
All defenses are up and running.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.797
Earth has everything in place
to keep itself safe.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.216
Great.
And Atlas preparations?

04:18.299 --> 04:20.802
Repairs to the IGF-Atlas were completed
early last week

04:20.885 --> 04:23.763
and it has since passed
every test protocol we've put it through.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.516
Good.
Any updates on the Altean pilot?

04:26.808 --> 04:28.059
Still unresponsive.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.103
But she could wake any day now.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.648
Perhaps if we had a little more time,
we could find out who sent her.

04:33.898 --> 04:36.651
There's no way to know
when or if she'll regain consciousness.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.529
We can't wait any longer.
We need to get back out there

04:39.612 --> 04:41.698
and end this war
before the Galra can reorganize.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.241
Keith's right.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.576
We'll be in constant communication
with Earth.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.829
When the Altean wakes up, we'll know.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.249
I have one more item to discuss.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.042
It's our last night on Earth

04:53.126 --> 04:55.336
and we've got a lot of hard work
ahead of us.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.297
We may not be back home for years.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.299
So I'm ordering you...

05:00.800 --> 05:02.343
to take some time for yourselves.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.429
Be with the ones you love.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.264
You've earned it.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.227
Hey, uh, Allura?

05:12.186 --> 05:13.021
What is it, Lance?

05:13.855 --> 05:16.524
Oh, nothing much.
Just, uh, checking in.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.861
So, how are things?

05:21.237 --> 05:23.656
I'm sorry,
but I really need to be getting back.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.700
Oh, right, yeah. Okay.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.453
[stammering] Um, well,
I don't want to keep you, so...

05:33.666 --> 05:34.500
[Lance] Oh!

05:35.209 --> 05:37.003
Uh, actually, I was wondering if--

05:37.086 --> 05:40.006
Maybe, if you want to,
you could have dinner with me tonight?

05:40.339 --> 05:43.009
[stammering] And my family.
Dinner with me and my family?

05:43.843 --> 05:45.595
My mom's cooking
for our last night together.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.972
I-- I just thought you could join us.

05:48.431 --> 05:51.559
-[Hunk's teeth chattering]
-That sounds wonderful, but I can't.

05:51.642 --> 05:56.230
Allura, I know you're worried about Luca,
but we're worried about you.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.067
It'll be good to get away for a night
and clear your head.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.402
Right, yeah, all that stuff
she's saying. Totally.

06:01.944 --> 06:04.280
Perhaps dinner would be nice.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.199
I'd love to.

06:06.282 --> 06:09.535
Really? Awesome!
Dinner tonight. Us. Yes.

06:09.786 --> 06:13.956
Okay, Loverboy Lance.
Now walk away before she changes her mind.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.177
Pidge, do you have a moment?

06:26.344 --> 06:27.386
Sure. What's up?

06:28.346 --> 06:29.889
Well, you see, I, um...

06:29.972 --> 06:33.059
-I have a--
-She has a date... with pointy chin!

06:33.267 --> 06:36.187
Where are proper courting vestments
obtained on your planet?

06:36.521 --> 06:39.357
Wait. A date? With Lance?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.317
-[robot squeals]
-Weird.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.028
I was hoping that you might be able
to accompany me

06:44.112 --> 06:47.615
as I choose my proper attire
in accordance to Earth's custom.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.242
[laughs]

06:49.325 --> 06:51.828
Katie? Fashion?
That's a good one.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.580
Well, I heard the mall has reopened.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.666
I've been wanting to check it out,
but I'm grounded.

06:56.874 --> 06:59.585
Grounded? I wasn't aware
humans could float.

06:59.794 --> 07:00.711
No, no.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.714
It just means I'm not allowed
to leave my mom's supervision.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.134
-It's a form of punishment.
-What are you grounded for?

07:06.217 --> 07:08.636
She's grounded because apparently
my daughter thinks

07:08.719 --> 07:11.597
that running away from home
and gallivanting off into space

07:11.681 --> 07:13.599
without her mother's permission

07:13.683 --> 07:16.269
is an acceptable activity
for a 15-year-old.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.898
Well, apparently, finding my brother
and saving my father

07:20.982 --> 07:23.985
[voice distorts] from an intergalactic
tyrant doesn't get me a pass!

07:24.527 --> 07:26.737
[voice distorts]
Not on your life, young lady.

07:27.196 --> 07:28.239
[robot squeals]

07:28.448 --> 07:31.409
Please, Colleen.
I could really use her help.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.870
We will not let her leave the ground once.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.582
All right.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.710
But only because I know how much
Katie hates shopping for clothing.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.837
-[Pidge growling]
-Thank you.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.089
[robot beeps]

07:47.467 --> 07:48.301
What is it?

07:48.801 --> 07:52.346
[doctor] She's stabilized, but we need
to be careful about how we proceed.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.683
[monitor beeping]

07:59.604 --> 08:01.814
[people chattering]

08:06.819 --> 08:10.156
Okay, "Operation Find Allura
a Date Outfit" is go.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.868
We're gonna take it one store at a time
till we come out of this place successful.

08:14.118 --> 08:15.369
Let the hunt begin!

08:18.539 --> 08:19.373
[Rizavi sighs]

08:19.457 --> 08:21.751
I love shopping. Don't you, Ina?

08:21.834 --> 08:25.421
It's a primal urge from when collecting
and gathering was a means of survival.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.673
It just calms me.
Like skydiving.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.426
Now come on,
I'm gonna shop this mall so hard.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.309
Killbot Phantasm 26: Revengifiance!

08:38.518 --> 08:39.393
This is out?

08:40.228 --> 08:42.980
Oh, my gosh! It came out
a few days before the Galra invaded.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.399
No one was ever able to reach the end.

08:45.691 --> 08:48.986
That's right. I have one
of the few undamaged units left.

08:49.403 --> 08:50.238
[both] We'll take it!

08:51.656 --> 08:54.742
Okay. Great to meet
such passionate KBP fans.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.118
What have you got to trade?

08:58.704 --> 08:59.539
Trade?

09:05.461 --> 09:07.088
I, uh...

09:07.964 --> 09:09.549
I don't really have anything.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.009
I'm sorry, but no trade, no game.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.095
[Pidge groans]

09:14.178 --> 09:17.265
Well, that's some way to treat
a Paladin of Voltron.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.059
Wait, what?
You mean, like, from the show?

09:20.726 --> 09:24.021
Show? Well, kind of.
It was based off me.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.565
My kid loves that show.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.026
The game is yours if I could just get
an autograph for my daughter.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.071
Sure thing!
Anything for the kids!

09:36.200 --> 09:38.160
Ah! Ooh? [chuckles]

09:38.828 --> 09:40.246
What?

09:44.125 --> 09:45.918
[Pidge, high-pitched]
We're space explorers!

09:46.002 --> 09:47.587
You got it, Chief! Far out!

09:55.261 --> 09:56.137
[exhales]

09:58.431 --> 09:59.265
[Coran] Yes?

09:59.348 --> 10:01.517
Oh, Lance!
To what do I owe this visit?

10:02.018 --> 10:04.729
Hey, Coran.
I wanted to ask you about Allura.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.231
Sure. What is it?
No one knows her better than I do.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.524
Except for maybe the mice.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.028
They do have a telepathic connection
to her, which seems like cheating to me.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.072
Right, yeah. Well, I'm going on a date
with her tonight and--

10:15.156 --> 10:18.242
What?! But you're not even royalty!
Or Altean!

10:18.326 --> 10:20.536
And you're definitely not Altean royalty!

10:20.620 --> 10:21.746
Whoa, Coran. Chill!

10:21.829 --> 10:24.498
I don't think Allura even cares
about stuff like that.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.417
It's not just about Allura.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.879
Did you even acquire permission
from her primary guardian?

10:29.962 --> 10:30.796
Well, who's that?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.089
Well, let's see.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.967
Ah, me!

10:36.802 --> 10:38.929
Now count to zingor, then knock.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.058
But Allura already said... Ugh!

10:42.141 --> 10:43.726
[tools whirring, buzzing]

10:43.809 --> 10:45.478
[clears throat, exhales]

10:45.561 --> 10:48.397
-[buzzing and whirring continue]
-[knocks]

10:49.940 --> 10:51.942
[soft piano music playing]

10:53.194 --> 10:55.613
Ah, Lance.
Please, have a seat.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.699
[pipe bubbling]

10:58.866 --> 11:00.826
Exactly what makes you think
you're qualified

11:00.910 --> 11:02.328
for such a prestigious position?

11:02.995 --> 11:05.247
For example, who are your references?

11:05.748 --> 11:08.918
Position? References?
What are you talking about?

11:09.335 --> 11:12.755
You see, I'll need at least two
notarized certificates of commendation

11:12.838 --> 11:15.591
speaking of your greatness
from reliable sources

11:15.674 --> 11:18.135
before I'll even consider
giving you my approval.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.347
And... [laughs] you must do something
about that outfit.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.974
Altean courting vestments are essential.

11:24.308 --> 11:27.395
Seeing as we're not on Altea,
we'll just have to make do.

11:29.146 --> 11:32.358
[Rizavi] Oh, I've got a good feeling
about this place.

11:32.733 --> 11:36.445
Allura, leave this to us.
Ladies, divide and conquer!

11:40.491 --> 11:41.409
[both giggle]

11:45.413 --> 11:46.288
Ta-da!

12:01.595 --> 12:03.639
[rustling]

12:06.350 --> 12:08.018
I think we've done it.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.441
Well, hello there.
Is this everything?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.776
Yep. Mission complete.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.404
Let's see, what have we got?

12:18.779 --> 12:23.534
A decorative tarp with casing,
one foot container and its mirror match,

12:23.742 --> 12:25.744
and some miniature chain binding.

12:26.454 --> 12:30.291
That'll be one phoeb of servitude
from your small friend there.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.542
What? A year?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.419
A month. I got this.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.589
How about you give us all this
and I give you an autograph

12:36.672 --> 12:39.216
from a world-famous Paladin of Voltron.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.971
No! Price just went up to three phoebs.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.097
[Pidge whimpers]

12:45.181 --> 12:48.809
I could give you a royal decree of service
from the Crown Princess of Alte...

12:49.602 --> 12:50.853
[sighs] Oh, right, I, um...

12:50.936 --> 12:54.899
I can bake you a deca-phoebs' worth
of blomfruit pies.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.693
I just need blomfruits.
You wouldn't happen to sell any?

12:57.776 --> 13:00.488
Shipping will cost you ten phoebs
of servitude alone.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.449
Perhaps this was a bad idea.

13:03.782 --> 13:06.118
I don't need the dress.
Let's just go.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.421
Wait! I'll give you a friendly deal.

13:17.755 --> 13:22.676
You can have this,
for Killbot Phantasm 26: Revengifiance.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.721
No deal!
What could you possibly need it for?

13:26.096 --> 13:29.475
I've been looking to get my claws
on that game for deca-phoebs.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.769
I'm a huge KBP fan.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.729
[Rizavi] Mm-mm, sorry.
No can do.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.440
I've waited three years
to get to the end of this game.

13:38.817 --> 13:42.696
Fine, you can have it.
We don't have any time to play it anyway.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.616
[Pidge grunts]

13:45.824 --> 13:47.117
[Allura] Thank you, Pidge.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.291
She's stabilized, but she won't speak
to any of the doctors.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.294
I was hoping a familiar face
might put her at ease.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.380
Maybe Romelle can help.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.799
I'll see if I can find her.

14:01.882 --> 14:04.051
[monitors beeping]

14:16.564 --> 14:20.192
[Lance grunting] Man, you can be
a real hard guy to find when you wanna be.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.194
-[metal clattering]
-Hey, Lance. Whoa!

14:22.820 --> 14:25.364
-What are you wearing?
-[sighs]

14:25.447 --> 14:27.908
Coran made it for me
for my date with Allura.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.452
A date with Allura?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.788
Wow! Well done, Lance.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.583
Thanks, but it could be our last.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.043
I can't keep
all these Altean customs straight.

14:38.961 --> 14:42.882
Listen, if she's going out with you,
it's because she likes you.

14:43.257 --> 14:46.677
The annoying, stupid,
Earth version of you.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.220
[laughs]

14:49.597 --> 14:51.098
[Lance] You watching the sun set?

14:51.640 --> 14:52.474
[Keith] Yeah.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.227
Might be a while
before we get to see it again.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.272
[Lance] Man,
I'm really gonna miss this place.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.858
That's why we've gotta end this war.

15:01.609 --> 15:05.154
And we're gonna do it with the Lance
that's the Paladin of the Red Lion.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.531
The Lance that's always got my back.

15:07.781 --> 15:11.994
And the Lance who knows exactly who he is
and what he's got to offer.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.042
[doorbell rings]

15:19.627 --> 15:21.503
Come in, come in, my dear!

15:21.587 --> 15:24.715
Oh, you look wonderful!
Doesn't she look wonderful, Lance?

15:25.633 --> 15:26.467
Wow!

15:27.217 --> 15:30.512
You look amazing.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.557
Thank you.
You look nice, too.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.769
[chuckles] Well,
it's no Altean vestments, but...

15:36.852 --> 15:37.937
[Allura giggles]

15:38.020 --> 15:40.564
Imagine you in a Forlongian brill hat.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.857
[both laugh]

15:42.107 --> 15:44.568
Oh, Allura, this is my mom and Pop-pop.

15:44.860 --> 15:45.819
You know Veronica.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.529
That's Rachel, my brother Marco,

15:47.613 --> 15:51.158
other brother Luis, his wife Lisa,
and their kids, Silvio and Nadia.

15:52.534 --> 15:55.829
[Marco] ...or the time when we were kids
and Veronica mixed dirt with water

15:55.913 --> 15:57.706
and told Lance it was chocolate milk.

15:57.790 --> 15:58.749
[all laughing]

15:58.832 --> 16:01.585
Oh, yeah!
I still can't believe he fell for it.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.504
[Allura laughs]
What did he do?

16:03.837 --> 16:05.589
He told on me, of course.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.342
Then Pop-pop gave him ice cream
and I got none.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.844
Yeah, Lance was always
the baby of the family.

16:10.928 --> 16:14.098
It only took you coming to dinner
to graduate him to the adult table.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.727
Speaking of dates,
maybe you can put in a good word for me

16:18.811 --> 16:20.854
with that long-haired friend
of yours, hmm?

16:21.230 --> 16:23.607
What, Keith?! No, no, no!

16:23.691 --> 16:26.026
[laughing] No way. No.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.989
Lance never brings girls home.
You must really mean something to him.

16:30.447 --> 16:31.407
That's strange.

16:31.740 --> 16:35.077
He always gave off the impression
of being rather popular with women.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.163
Oh, he gets that from his father.
It's all talk.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.875
But if you can get past that,
you'll find a good boy with a big heart.

16:42.584 --> 16:43.752
[Veronica] A toast...

16:44.128 --> 16:45.045
to family.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.506
Though we may be apart after tomorrow,

16:47.589 --> 16:49.466
we'll always remain close at heart.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.593
Family is forever.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.262
[all] To family!

17:00.352 --> 17:02.646
[beeping]

17:05.983 --> 17:07.109
[door opens]

17:07.192 --> 17:09.445
I'm so glad to see you're all right, Luca.

17:09.903 --> 17:10.779
We can help.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.449
What happened to you?
Where's the colony?

17:13.907 --> 17:15.743
So you can betray them yet again?

17:16.326 --> 17:17.161
What?

17:17.494 --> 17:19.038
You abandoned us, Romelle.

17:19.538 --> 17:23.709
And for the Paladins of Voltron,
the very ones who killed our savior Lotor.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.419
No, it's not like that!

17:25.753 --> 17:28.005
You've sided with the great destroyers!

17:28.297 --> 17:31.383
She told us of their lies.
She's going to fix it all.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.178
She'll reunite us with Lotor, with Altea.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.555
You don't stand a chance
against Honerva-- [gasps]

17:40.392 --> 17:42.394
[flatlining tone]

17:44.271 --> 17:46.231
[alarm buzzing]

17:58.660 --> 18:00.496
[crickets chirping]

18:07.127 --> 18:09.463
[Lance] This place
used to be so beautiful.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.468
It's all my fault
the Galra did this to your home.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.845
No, it's not your fault.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.057
Besides, meeting you is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.268
When we were out there,
fighting against the Galra,

19:04.351 --> 19:05.686
I somehow felt like...

19:06.728 --> 19:08.021
like we were a family.

19:08.647 --> 19:12.401
Each of us was alone,
but we were alone together.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.736
But now, here on Earth,

19:15.320 --> 19:17.364
I see that everyone already has a family

19:17.948 --> 19:20.367
and a home to return to
once the war is over.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.870
Everyone except me.

19:24.246 --> 19:28.542
And for the first time, I feel uncertain
about what my future holds.

19:29.918 --> 19:33.255
It's silly. I used to think
that the team relied on me.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.841
That I needed to be strong
for everyone else.

19:36.758 --> 19:40.637
But now I see
it was I that needed all of you.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.140
You are my strength.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.187
Allura, you are not alone.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.690
And if I have anything to say about it,
you'll never be alone.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.444
I-- I don't care if this is
only our first date. I...

19:58.572 --> 20:00.866
Allura, I love you.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.661
I have for a long time.
I wanna be your family.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.289
Earth can be your home,
or anywhere you wanna go.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.373
It doesn't matter.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.959
I would follow you across the universe.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.253
You truly feel that way?

20:20.636 --> 20:21.887
With all my heart.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.112
[squeals, beeping]

20:39.404 --> 20:40.280
-Hmm?
-Huh?

20:43.617 --> 20:45.869
[beeping, squealing]

20:46.245 --> 20:48.372
[chuckles] I think he wants us to smile.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.750
[powers up, camera shutter clicks]

21:13.272 --> 21:16.441
If Honerva sent that beast,
then our mission must change.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.444
No, we have a plan
and we need to stick to it.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.781
If Honerva's really behind this,
I'm sure we'll find her along the way.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.367
Or she'll find us.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.204
[crowd chattering]

21:36.253 --> 21:39.881
This will be perhaps
the most defining moment in our history.

21:40.340 --> 21:43.844
The day humankind
reaches beyond its home world

21:43.927 --> 21:48.807
to help the immense universe
of which we inhabit such a small part.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.727
In the blink of an eye,
the world as we knew it

21:51.810 --> 21:54.313
became much larger
than we'd ever thought possible.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.190
And now we rise up to join the fight

21:57.274 --> 21:59.651
alongside so many others
different from us...

21:59.735 --> 22:01.528
-[beeping]
-...but of like minds,

22:01.903 --> 22:04.531
to stand firm in the face of tyranny.

22:04.948 --> 22:07.909
[Allura] For all deserve
to decide their own future

22:07.993 --> 22:12.581
as we have decided to spend ours
ensuring the freedom of the universe.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.752
[Shiro] Each and every one of you
has given something to this fight.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.421
Many have been lost, but not in vain.

22:20.589 --> 22:24.051
Because through their sacrifice,
many more will live on.

22:24.634 --> 22:26.428
I make you this promise now.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.057
We will return triumphant.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.100
[rumbling]

23:07.427 --> 23:10.013
[Pidge, high-pitched]
I'm descended from a clan of ninjas!
