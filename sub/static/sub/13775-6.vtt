WEBVTT

00:02.101 --> 00:04.124
PETE: Why are we watching a commercial?
Give me this thing.

00:04.244 --> 00:05.011
KEVIN: I don't know.

00:05.078 --> 00:05.978
You're a terrible driver.

00:06.046 --> 00:06.846
What are you talking about?

00:06.914 --> 00:08.447
The game's not even on right now.

00:08.515 --> 00:10.316
It's Saturday; there's
like 700 college games on.

00:10.383 --> 00:11.918
If we go to commercial, you
switch to another game.

00:11.985 --> 00:13.619
Commercial there, switch to another game.
Halftime, catch

00:13.687 --> 00:15.155
two minutes of <i>Storage Wars.</i>

00:15.275 --> 00:16.943
<i>Sometimes I have to take
a break in between.</i>

00:17.011 --> 00:19.012
<i>Fine, then sleep on the side
of the road and give the wheel</i>

00:19.079 --> 00:19.846
<i>to somebody else.</i>

00:19.914 --> 00:20.780
<i>This is my domain.</i>

00:20.848 --> 00:21.982
<i>TACO: Hey, guys.</i>

00:22.049 --> 00:23.950
<i>Kevin, can I use your TV
to play Sega Genesis?</i>

00:24.018 --> 00:25.986
<i>I just got Joel Madden Football,
and I'm getting good at it.</i>

00:26.053 --> 00:26.987
<i>RUXIN: Joel Madden Football?</i>

00:27.054 --> 00:28.855
<i>Yeah, he's the drummer of Good Charlotte.
I guess he</i>

00:28.923 --> 00:29.689
<i>likes football or something.</i>

00:29.757 --> 00:31.491
<i>Hey, Taco, what's going
on with the shirt?</i>

00:31.559 --> 00:33.459
<i>Well, the official logo T-shirts
are super expensive, so</i>

00:33.528 --> 00:34.494
<i>I started making my own.</i>

00:34.562 --> 00:36.630
<i>People seem to like them, so
I think I'm gonna sell them.</i>

00:36.697 --> 00:38.565
<i>You know those rings are a
blatant copyright infringement?</i>

00:38.633 --> 00:41.167
<i>No, look, I rearranged the
rings, and I spelled Olympix</i>

00:41.235 --> 00:42.168
<i>with an X.</i>

00:42.236 --> 00:43.169
<i>And you misspelled London.</i>

00:43.237 --> 00:45.471
<i>Yeah, I gave it an O instead of a U.</i>

00:45.540 --> 00:47.340
<i>If you got a problem with
it, talk to my lawyer.</i>

00:47.408 --> 00:48.542
<i>I've been faxing him all week.</i>

00:48.609 --> 00:50.644
<i>I gave him Andre's office fax number.</i>

00:50.711 --> 00:51.678
<i>Give me that.</i>

00:51.746 --> 00:52.846
<i>No, you're a bad driver.</i>

00:52.914 --> 00:54.814
<i>You know what, I don't
need your remote.</i>

00:54.882 --> 00:58.384
<i>I think I have a second
remote over here.</i>

00:58.452 --> 01:01.187
<i>This is better than
watching a nature channel.</i>

01:01.255 --> 01:03.890
<i>It's very... (in English
accent): In this</i>

01:03.958 --> 01:07.427
episode of <i>MacArthurs in the
Mist,</i> the silverback MacArthur

01:07.494 --> 01:10.664
searches for a second tool.

01:10.731 --> 01:13.332
What he doesn't realize is that
his search for the second tool

01:13.400 --> 01:15.201
is ultimately futile.

01:15.269 --> 01:17.170
(laughs)

01:17.237 --> 01:21.174
(grunting)

01:21.241 --> 01:23.043
(chuckles)

01:25.835 --> 01:29.515
It seems as though a shiny object has
captured the male MacArthur's attention.

01:29.584 --> 01:31.384
(grunts, horn honks)

01:31.452 --> 01:33.787
(distant yelling)

01:33.854 --> 01:36.189
(honking continues)

01:40.057 --> 01:41.427
ANDRE: Ta-da.
What is this?

01:41.495 --> 01:42.428
Check it out.

01:42.496 --> 01:45.031
It may be an RV today, but on
Sunday, in the Soldier Field

01:45.099 --> 01:48.234
parking lot, this becomes Dre Town.

01:48.302 --> 01:53.272
I am taking you all on a tailgating
experience of a lifetime. Yeah!

01:53.340 --> 01:54.474
Awesome, Andre, thank you.

01:54.541 --> 01:57.911
I don't want to go tailgating, and
I don't want to go to a game.

01:57.979 --> 02:00.246
I want to watch football in
the comfort of my own home.

02:00.314 --> 02:03.483
I knew you were gonna say that; that's
why I have Ruxin-proofed this idea.

02:03.550 --> 02:04.450
Really?

02:04.518 --> 02:07.553
How about going to the stadium and
sitting in hard, shitty seats?

02:07.622 --> 02:08.622
We're in a box.

02:08.689 --> 02:10.889
Okay, what about waiting in
long bathroom lines for the

02:10.958 --> 02:11.958
privilege of pissing in a sink?

02:12.026 --> 02:14.227
Private bathroom, no lines, no waiting.

02:14.294 --> 02:16.830
How about not having Red Zone
or being able to watch instant

02:16.897 --> 02:19.065
replay 'cause you're
stuck in a stadium?

02:19.133 --> 02:21.300
The RV is equipped with a
dish and the box has TV.

02:21.368 --> 02:23.770
Your Honor, case dismissed.

02:23.838 --> 02:24.904
Boom, boom.

02:24.972 --> 02:26.239
Boom, tailgating is awesome.

02:26.306 --> 02:28.574
You get to drink beer early in
the morning, you get to play

02:28.643 --> 02:30.576
touch football, we get
to barbecue, yeah.

02:30.645 --> 02:31.577
Barbecue. Huge.

02:31.646 --> 02:32.578
(grunting)

02:32.647 --> 02:33.579
Tailgating, tailgating.

02:33.648 --> 02:34.580
JENNY: Ow, ow.

02:34.649 --> 02:35.581
This is great.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.517
It is. Ruxin, you need to
stop being a little bitch and

02:37.584 --> 02:39.352
just enjoy the fact that we're
gonna see the Bears live.

02:39.419 --> 02:41.420
I love the Bears, but if the
Bears are playing my fantasy

02:41.488 --> 02:44.490
team, Pete top, Kevin bottom, I
would hope that they would beat

02:44.558 --> 02:46.693
them worse than Phil Spector
after a night of drinking.

02:46.761 --> 02:47.961
Whoa, tailgating?

02:48.029 --> 02:48.962
You know it.

02:49.030 --> 02:50.030
Oh, this is a great idea.

02:50.097 --> 02:53.199
It'll be the perfect place to launch my
official unofficial NFL T-shirt line.

02:53.267 --> 02:55.268
Is anyone living in here till Sunday?

02:55.335 --> 02:56.269
What? No.

02:56.336 --> 02:57.203
Great. I'm gonna move in.

02:57.271 --> 02:58.138
I'll store my merch here.

02:58.205 --> 03:00.140
I'm gonna turn it into
my work loft space.

03:00.207 --> 03:01.875
Let me introduce you
to Taco Town, come on.

03:01.942 --> 03:03.877
No, no, no. No one is moving...
This is Dre Town.

03:03.944 --> 03:04.711
Taco Town.

03:04.779 --> 03:06.713
This is perfect.

03:08.916 --> 03:09.849
Ruxin, I got a problem.

03:09.917 --> 03:10.850
I'm being cyber-bullied.

03:10.918 --> 03:11.851
No.

03:11.919 --> 03:13.853
Remember Donny "The Seed" Sadowski?

03:13.921 --> 03:15.855
Oh, that kid from high school?

03:15.923 --> 03:18.792
Yeah, looked like he was gonna
punch you at any given moment.

03:18.859 --> 03:21.627
Yeah, and would jerk off into his
hand and then rub it into your hair?

03:21.696 --> 03:22.495
He's threatening me.

03:22.563 --> 03:23.563
What?

03:23.630 --> 03:26.800
Yeah, check this out.

03:26.867 --> 03:27.834
What's, uh, "bronies"?

03:27.902 --> 03:29.169
Bros who like <i>My Little Pony.</i>

03:29.236 --> 03:30.303
Oh, the <i>Godspell</i> reunion.

03:30.370 --> 03:31.370
Those guys are the best.

03:31.438 --> 03:34.174
I'd just love to get us back
together for one trust circle.

03:34.241 --> 03:35.408
This is what I'm nervous about.

03:35.475 --> 03:36.642
Look at this, boom, boom, boom.

03:36.711 --> 03:38.644
"I'm gonna seed you, soldier."

03:38.713 --> 03:39.679
How did he find you?

03:39.747 --> 03:40.680
I friended him.

03:40.748 --> 03:41.514
You friended him?

03:41.582 --> 03:43.416
Well, we all went to high
school together. It's about

03:43.483 --> 03:44.718
creating a social network.

03:44.785 --> 03:47.153
Of people who hate you and
you hated in high school?

03:47.221 --> 03:48.321
This is a threat, okay?

03:48.388 --> 03:49.589
I need a restraining order.

03:49.656 --> 03:52.992
So you want something that says he can't
come within, like, 50 feet of you?

03:53.060 --> 03:54.828
Yes, I need to protect myself.

03:54.895 --> 03:57.697
You know, I have a practice, I
have, you know, a future wife

03:57.765 --> 04:00.066
out there who doesn't
want me to get hurt.

04:00.134 --> 04:02.902
Your hypothetical imaginary wife
doesn't want you to get hurt?

04:02.970 --> 04:04.003
No, or my kids.

04:04.071 --> 04:04.838
You have kids?

04:04.905 --> 04:06.672
Of course, Tina, Tammy and Toni.

04:06.741 --> 04:07.506
Three daughters?

04:07.574 --> 04:08.507
Yeah, Toni with an "I."

04:08.575 --> 04:10.343
So they're all gonna be strippers?

04:10.410 --> 04:11.277
They have to be strippers?

04:11.345 --> 04:13.446
That's true; one of them will
end up doing burlesque if she's

04:13.513 --> 04:15.048
a little chunkier.

04:15.116 --> 04:17.550
Okay, for the peace of mind of
your future hypothetical wife

04:17.618 --> 04:19.952
and future hypothetical slutty
daughters, I will file a

04:20.019 --> 04:21.954
restraining order for you.

04:22.022 --> 04:23.589
Thank you.

04:23.657 --> 04:25.725
I will file a restraining
order against this, too.

04:25.793 --> 04:27.260
Okay. Sorry.

04:27.327 --> 04:30.096
Game day.

04:30.164 --> 04:31.264
Tailgating, bro.

04:31.331 --> 04:32.265
Up top.

04:32.332 --> 04:33.266
Boom, yeah.

04:33.333 --> 04:34.367
Bro?

04:34.434 --> 04:35.368
Game day.

04:35.435 --> 04:36.402
You call me bro now?

04:36.470 --> 04:37.237
Yeah.

04:37.304 --> 04:38.204
Really?

04:38.272 --> 04:39.139
What, bro?

04:39.206 --> 04:41.374
You have to stop calling
me bro, okay, Kevin?

04:41.441 --> 04:43.877
You have got such a sweet deal here.

04:43.944 --> 04:46.479
I am so much hotter than
any of your friends.

04:46.546 --> 04:47.747
True.

04:47.815 --> 04:50.784
And you get to have sex
with me whenever I let you.

04:50.851 --> 04:51.785
Thank you.

04:51.852 --> 04:54.387
So if you want to enjoy that
privilege, you have to start

04:54.454 --> 04:55.721
treating me like a lady.

04:55.790 --> 04:58.557
Okay... ma'am?

04:58.625 --> 05:01.261
You know what, better yet,
treat me with the respect that

05:01.328 --> 05:02.262
you treat these Zubaz.

05:02.329 --> 05:03.096
What? Ow.

05:03.164 --> 05:03.930
Huh?

05:03.998 --> 05:05.131
Okay, ow. All right.

05:05.199 --> 05:06.132
Hold on. Ow.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.066
All right, stop.

05:07.134 --> 05:09.402
If you hit my happle, babe,
nobody's going to the game.

05:09.469 --> 05:10.436
Ow! Ow!

05:10.504 --> 05:12.806
Come on, dude.

05:17.544 --> 05:20.280
Feast your eyes on a
spread unlike any other.

05:20.347 --> 05:25.351
Tofu dogs, some almond butter nacho
cheese and some vegetarian chili.

05:25.419 --> 05:26.652
Where is the food?

05:26.720 --> 05:27.821
What? This is the food.

05:27.888 --> 05:30.023
No, this is vegetarian bullshit.
Where's the food?

05:30.090 --> 05:32.525
Well, um, I was talking to
somebody very recently who said,

05:32.592 --> 05:35.962
"Just because we're party animals
doesn't mean we have to eat animals."

05:36.030 --> 05:38.531
And was that person the cute
checkout girl at Whole Foods?

05:38.598 --> 05:39.799
Oh, Jesus.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.869
(groans) Dre Town sucks goat scrote.

05:42.937 --> 05:45.305
Dre Town does not suck goat
scrote; it's the best.

05:45.372 --> 05:49.508
It does; this is when I should be home,
drinking my coffee, preparing my little

05:49.576 --> 05:51.044
tum-tum for a morning explosion.

05:51.111 --> 05:53.112
That's when I hit the toilet.

05:53.180 --> 05:55.849
I do my little tinkering on my phone.

05:55.916 --> 05:58.451
It's my tinker-stinker
time, and now it's ruined.

05:58.518 --> 06:02.455
Well, I knew Andre would pull a bitch move.
This is why I brought my own meat.

06:02.522 --> 06:03.456
That's right, Kev!

06:03.523 --> 06:04.457
There you go.

06:04.524 --> 06:05.458
Fire up this grill.

06:05.525 --> 06:08.494
Did you... did you
fill the propane tank?

06:08.562 --> 06:09.495
What do you mean?

06:09.563 --> 06:10.496
It comes full, right?

06:10.564 --> 06:11.664
It's not Avis, Andre.

06:11.732 --> 06:14.033
You have to fill the propane
tank when you rent the grill.

06:14.101 --> 06:15.201
Dre Town sucks!

06:15.269 --> 06:16.502
Dre Town does not suck.

06:16.570 --> 06:18.537
It's full of delicious nutrients.

06:18.605 --> 06:21.007
I don't want nutrients, Andre.

06:21.075 --> 06:24.744
I'm gonna go sit on my fat ass inside
with 60,000 other animals. I just want to

06:24.811 --> 06:25.745
be filled with grease.

06:25.812 --> 06:27.680
Well, that's not good for you colon.

06:27.748 --> 06:28.814
I don't care about my colon.

06:28.883 --> 06:30.016
My colon is not my problem.

06:30.084 --> 06:32.718
It's their problem.

06:32.786 --> 06:33.987
(Jenny sighs)

06:34.054 --> 06:35.889
Are you waiting for the bathroom?

06:35.956 --> 06:36.722
Yeah.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.925
Awesome. I had too many
bloody Marys on the way here.

06:38.993 --> 06:42.495
I have to pee so bad, so I'm just gonna cut...
Whoa, whoa, I don't think so.

06:42.562 --> 06:44.397
You're gonna wait your turn in line.

06:44.464 --> 06:45.398
I'm a lady.

06:45.465 --> 06:46.499
We have tiny bladders.

06:46.566 --> 06:48.501
Are you the same lady who
recently posted on the message

06:48.568 --> 06:50.703
boards, "I will give up my
priority on the waiver wire as

06:50.771 --> 06:53.172
soon as Pete shits out an
omelet for Andre to eat."

06:53.240 --> 06:55.674
One in the same, and I'm still
waiting for that omelet.

06:55.742 --> 06:57.076
Whoo!

06:57.144 --> 06:58.378
Well, bathroom's broken.

06:58.445 --> 06:59.879
What? How broken?

06:59.947 --> 07:01.514
All the way.

07:01.581 --> 07:03.182
I got to stop eating mayonnaise.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.850
(Jenny groans)

07:04.919 --> 07:07.287
Here, try this.

07:07.354 --> 07:08.587
All right, who wants a beer?

07:08.655 --> 07:09.588
Let's do it.

07:09.656 --> 07:10.589
I'll take one.

07:10.657 --> 07:11.891
Football time.

07:11.959 --> 07:12.959
(laughter)

07:13.027 --> 07:14.127
It's not funny, Taco.

07:14.194 --> 07:15.895
Come on, pick this up.

07:15.963 --> 07:17.797
Come on, Taco.

07:17.864 --> 07:20.300
On this episode of <i>MacArthurs
in the Mist,</i> the MacArthur

07:20.367 --> 07:23.236
family forages on the
soft forest floor.

07:23.304 --> 07:27.440
Look as the younger male shows
his beta status by picking

07:27.507 --> 07:30.977
food right off of the... The
brawl begins. The brawl.

07:31.045 --> 07:32.946
Are they playing or are they fighting?

07:33.013 --> 07:36.649
As the MacArthurs forage for
the only food they can find,

07:36.716 --> 07:39.953
they try to taste it and understand
what it is they're eating.

07:40.020 --> 07:42.822
One wonders if there is
brilliance in their ignorance;

07:42.889 --> 07:44.324
things we have lost.

07:44.391 --> 07:46.392
(bus horn blares)

07:46.460 --> 07:47.560
Christ, dude.

07:47.627 --> 07:50.930
Hey, you can't park here, man!

07:50.998 --> 07:53.399
FRANK: Ooh... Frank?

07:53.467 --> 07:54.600
"The Body."

07:54.668 --> 07:55.901
Gibiatti.

07:55.970 --> 07:56.970
FRANK: You know Tug.

07:57.037 --> 07:58.071
TUG: Eat a dick.

07:58.138 --> 07:59.238
That's right. Eat a dick!

07:59.306 --> 08:01.074
Yo, roll it out, dawg, roll it out.

08:01.141 --> 08:02.976
What the hell are you doing here?

08:03.043 --> 08:05.111
Can I tailgate and watch some
football with the Vatos Locos?

08:05.179 --> 08:07.013
Are you guys still calling
yourselves the "Vatos Locos"?

08:07.081 --> 08:08.181
Yeah, Pete, we are.

08:08.248 --> 08:10.583
What lame-ass name do you
guys call yourselves?

08:10.650 --> 08:11.517
The Dre Tones.

08:11.585 --> 08:12.518
> No, we don't.

08:12.586 --> 08:14.253
Come on. Remember from the talent show?

08:14.321 --> 08:15.855
The Dre Tones. I'm a Dre Tone.

08:15.922 --> 08:17.857
♪ Do you recall the time...? ♪

08:17.924 --> 08:18.491
Shut up!

08:18.558 --> 08:19.359
We never agreed.

08:19.426 --> 08:20.426
♪ Down by Lakeshore Drive? ♪

08:20.494 --> 08:22.295
Yo, you got to lock that down.

08:22.363 --> 08:23.429
That's a mess right there.

08:23.497 --> 08:24.464
What's up with the Zubaz?

08:24.531 --> 08:26.599
Were every other pair of
pants in the world dirty?

08:26.666 --> 08:28.334
You got holes. I can see your balls.

08:28.402 --> 08:30.036
Is that what you like, Gibiatti?

08:30.104 --> 08:31.104
Yeah, I like dudes' balls.

08:31.171 --> 08:32.871
Hey, Tug, do I like dudes' balls?

08:32.938 --> 08:33.806
He loves dudes' balls.

08:33.874 --> 08:34.807
No, I don't, man.

08:34.875 --> 08:35.808
I don't like dudes' balls.

08:35.876 --> 08:36.808
He doesn't. Ha-ha!

08:36.876 --> 08:38.010
What the hell, man?

08:38.078 --> 08:39.611
Hey, you guys know these guys?

08:39.679 --> 08:41.347
Unfortunately, we went to
high school with them.

08:41.414 --> 08:42.181
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

08:42.249 --> 08:45.518
If you want to step over here, let
me get you away from these dweebs.

08:45.585 --> 08:46.785
Oh, I'm married to this one.

08:46.853 --> 08:47.387
Thank you.

08:47.454 --> 08:48.354
You're married to him?

08:48.422 --> 08:48.988
Yeah, Body.

08:49.056 --> 08:49.788
Do me a favor.

08:49.856 --> 08:52.558
Blink if you want me to call
the cops right now. Blink.

08:52.626 --> 08:55.328
Now, my uncle's name might be
on this lease, but it is yours.

08:55.396 --> 08:57.196
Would you mind if I use your bathroom?

08:57.264 --> 08:58.131
Ours is broken.

08:58.198 --> 08:59.698
There's something... I
destroyed that thing.

08:59.766 --> 09:01.367
Wait. The bathroom's not working?

09:01.435 --> 09:02.001
Yeah.

09:02.069 --> 09:03.669
Yo, man, our bathroom is tight.

09:03.737 --> 09:04.303
Really?

09:04.371 --> 09:05.371
We got hand soaps, lotions.

09:05.439 --> 09:08.007
We got dental picks that have...
You use the picks to get

09:08.075 --> 09:09.075
the jizz out of your teeth?

09:09.143 --> 09:10.676
Jesus, man, there's a lady here.

09:10.744 --> 09:11.511
That is inappropriate.

09:11.578 --> 09:13.712
If you need to use the
bathroom, it is yours.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.081
Thank you. Thank you so much.

09:15.149 --> 09:16.882
You know, let me get some
of that bathroom action.

09:16.950 --> 09:18.717
You think you're going
on the bump bus? Never.

09:18.785 --> 09:19.852
You never go on that bus.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.320
You call your bus the "bump bus"?

09:21.388 --> 09:23.889
Yeah, because we're bumping parts
on there, you know what I'm saying?

09:23.957 --> 09:25.558
Can I remove my wife from the bump bus?

09:25.625 --> 09:27.093
No. She'll come out when she's ready.

09:27.161 --> 09:27.760
Free country, dawg.

09:27.827 --> 09:30.163
What'd you do, buy a bunch of
roofenol for the bump bus?

09:30.230 --> 09:30.863
Yeah, we did.

09:30.931 --> 09:32.365
No, no. What are you saying, Tug?

09:32.433 --> 09:33.099
He asked a question.

09:33.167 --> 09:34.067
I'm giving him an answer.

09:34.134 --> 09:35.034
I was roofenoled once.

09:35.102 --> 09:36.202
What?

09:36.270 --> 09:37.403
Yeah, I got roofied once.

09:37.471 --> 09:39.939
I was playing chess with this
guy in the park, and then

09:40.006 --> 09:41.174
just totally blacked out.

09:41.241 --> 09:42.608
And I woke up in the bushes.

09:42.676 --> 09:43.609
I don't know what happened.

09:43.677 --> 09:44.343
What?

09:44.411 --> 09:45.678
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

09:53.118 --> 09:55.511
Sweet way to write your
name on your own table.

09:55.631 --> 09:57.264
Yeah, that's the Vatos Locos snacks.

09:57.332 --> 09:59.199
That way, we know this
is our food only.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.869
'Cause everybody else is gonna try
to get in on your food, right?

10:01.937 --> 10:03.571
Yeah, well, they're not
allowed to, right, Ted?

10:03.639 --> 10:04.405
You want a hot dog?

10:04.473 --> 10:05.239
No! What did I just say?

10:05.307 --> 10:05.973
What did I just say?

10:06.041 --> 10:06.741
Just playing, man.

10:06.809 --> 10:08.709
Buddy, you don't understand
the way the world works.

10:08.777 --> 10:10.945
I think I understand the
world works... Whoa!

10:11.012 --> 10:11.712
Jesus Christ!

10:11.780 --> 10:12.547
Who is this now?

10:12.614 --> 10:13.380
Oh, look who's back.

10:13.449 --> 10:14.949
It's the Seed.

10:15.016 --> 10:15.750
Remember the Seed?

10:15.818 --> 10:17.785
He's out of jail; got
some anger issues.

10:17.853 --> 10:19.153
Uh-oh.

10:19.220 --> 10:20.555
Guys, I'm so nervous.

10:20.622 --> 10:22.757
Hey, remember these guys, Seed?

10:22.825 --> 10:23.724
Oh, yeah, I remember 'em.

10:23.792 --> 10:25.793
(yelling)

10:25.861 --> 10:26.828
You just got seeded!

10:26.895 --> 10:27.829
Seeded!

10:27.896 --> 10:29.897
You got some of my seed
up on your hair follicle!

10:29.965 --> 10:31.398
How did you find him?

10:31.467 --> 10:36.604
Uh, I found out his whereabouts
'cause he posted it online, soldier.

10:36.672 --> 10:37.672
Where did you post online?

10:37.739 --> 10:39.273
I just posted on my wall.

10:39.341 --> 10:41.742
I just said the Dre Tones are
coming to Soldier Field to bring

10:41.810 --> 10:43.310
their Motown sound to Dre Town.

10:43.378 --> 10:45.947
For any number of reasons, you
should not have written that.

10:46.014 --> 10:46.781
It got, like, four likes.

10:46.849 --> 10:47.648
Ugh!

10:47.716 --> 10:50.250
Were you trying to be funny when you
put a restraining order out on me?

10:50.318 --> 10:51.118
Yes, that was a joke.

10:51.186 --> 10:51.919
It was a joke.

10:51.987 --> 10:52.620
It was a goof.

10:52.688 --> 10:54.121
It doesn't sound like a joke to me.

10:54.189 --> 10:55.957
Well, you were joking, it
didn't sound like a joke to me.

10:56.024 --> 10:56.858
When was I joking?

10:56.925 --> 10:57.825
You said you'd kick my ass.

10:57.893 --> 10:58.659
That wasn't a joke.

10:58.727 --> 11:00.928
Look, the restraining order
was a goof, all right?

11:00.996 --> 11:04.431
But it is real and it is
binding, so you, my friend, are

11:04.500 --> 11:06.601
gonna have to stay 50
feet away from him.

11:06.668 --> 11:08.769
Then, I'll tell you what, I'm
just gonna punch you in the

11:08.837 --> 11:09.604
teeth before I do that.

11:09.671 --> 11:11.305
No, okay, all right, you know what?

11:11.373 --> 11:12.139
How about... how about this?

11:12.207 --> 11:12.840
How about this?

11:12.908 --> 11:14.842
Why don't I stay 50 feet away from you?

11:14.910 --> 11:16.343
All right, so, yeah... How about that?

11:16.411 --> 11:17.177
Like, I mean, about here?

11:17.245 --> 11:18.713
Walk... You think that's 50 feet?

11:18.780 --> 11:19.614
Yeah, keep going.

11:19.681 --> 11:20.381
Is this 50 feet?

11:20.448 --> 11:22.383
Here I'll show you where 50 feet is.

11:22.450 --> 11:24.952
(whipping noise)

11:25.020 --> 11:29.657
Welcome back, Seed... (voice fading)

11:29.725 --> 11:31.492
Fwap! Fwap!

11:31.560 --> 11:32.560
You've got it on a lasso?

11:32.628 --> 11:33.460
Okay? I have to tie it up;

11:33.529 --> 11:34.662
otherwise, it's 60 feet.

11:34.730 --> 11:35.997
Pass it around!

11:36.064 --> 11:37.297
Fwap! Fwap! Give it back!

11:37.365 --> 11:38.633
Give it back! Whap!

11:38.700 --> 11:39.967
Ah! Bam!

11:40.035 --> 11:40.801
Look at that!

11:40.869 --> 11:43.504
Hey, Ted, you want in
on this dick work?

11:43.572 --> 11:44.805
(all grunting)

11:44.873 --> 11:46.140
Whoa!

11:46.207 --> 11:47.675
Whap!

11:47.743 --> 11:48.409
Whoa!

11:48.476 --> 11:49.076
Pwap! Pwap!

11:49.144 --> 11:50.511
Oh, service!

11:50.579 --> 11:52.379
All over your face and your booty.

11:52.447 --> 11:54.838
You just been seeded!

11:55.111 --> 11:56.183
There you go.

11:58.433 --> 12:00.367
Hello, M.C. Mahon.

12:00.435 --> 12:01.935
It's McMahon, thanks.

12:02.002 --> 12:03.437
That's not what that says.

12:03.504 --> 12:04.504
Can you sign a T-shirt for me?

12:04.572 --> 12:05.539
Sure.

12:05.606 --> 12:07.106
Who do you want this made out to?

12:07.174 --> 12:08.208
Oh, no, no, no, no!

12:08.275 --> 12:09.209
I brought my own.

12:09.276 --> 12:11.110
There you go.

12:11.178 --> 12:12.446
What in the hell is this?

12:12.513 --> 12:13.179
It's you.

12:13.247 --> 12:14.381
I look like a '70s porn star.

12:14.449 --> 12:15.281
You're welcome.

12:15.350 --> 12:17.116
This doesn't look anything like me.

12:17.184 --> 12:18.184
Yeah, it's you-- look.

12:18.252 --> 12:19.386
You're the punky quarter bag.

12:19.454 --> 12:20.654
What's a quarter bag?

12:20.722 --> 12:22.522
Oh, and can you sign 300 more?

12:22.590 --> 12:23.724
What are you, high?

12:23.791 --> 12:25.892
Yeah, but that has
nothing to do with this.

12:25.960 --> 12:30.664
Found a little extra propane in the
bottom-- and burger time! Mmm!

12:30.732 --> 12:31.665
That's, like, burger tartare.

12:31.733 --> 12:32.666
No, it's not.

12:32.734 --> 12:33.734
It's medium rare.

12:33.801 --> 12:35.001
No, that is barely dead.

12:35.069 --> 12:36.670
You got the barbecue to work?

12:36.738 --> 12:37.838
Yeah. Do you want a burger?

12:37.905 --> 12:39.072
No. Looks rare.

12:39.139 --> 12:40.474
You know what? Fine.

12:40.541 --> 12:43.910
You guys don't want a burger, you
don't have to... Ooh... sizzling!

12:43.978 --> 12:45.245
You guys are missing out.

12:45.312 --> 12:46.246
Don't eat that!

12:46.313 --> 12:47.514
Please, I'm starving!

12:47.582 --> 12:49.883
Kevin, it's raw-- it's gonna
make you sick; you're gonna die.

12:49.950 --> 12:56.089
Mmm... Look as the MacArthur begins
to feast on an afternoon snack.

12:56.156 --> 13:01.728
He licks at his fingers, enjoying the
meal, but is easily distracted by flies.

13:01.796 --> 13:06.433
He remains ever watchful for any
uninvited poachers in the market.

13:06.501 --> 13:11.070
Guys! Are you doing that thing? The thing that...
(Kevin grunts threateningly)

13:11.138 --> 13:13.774
These gluten-free buns
are expensive, okay?

13:13.841 --> 13:18.211
Mmm, mmm... Aah... Yes! Yes!

13:18.279 --> 13:21.047
Wow, looks like Jenny's
becoming a regular Vata Loca.

13:21.115 --> 13:23.116
Johnny, why do they call you "Seed"?

13:23.183 --> 13:25.285
I guess it's due to the fact
that a couple of years ago I

13:25.352 --> 13:27.921
worked at a kibbutz, and I was
in charge of the gardening so I

13:27.988 --> 13:30.223
would sow a lot of the seeds, you know.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.225
Really? You just sowed a ton of seed.

13:32.293 --> 13:35.962
Hey, speaking of sowing seed, Jenny,
you want a bite of my kielbasa?

13:36.030 --> 13:37.297
Hey, man, Tug, inappropriate.

13:37.364 --> 13:39.299
Aren't we above the penis jokes?

13:39.366 --> 13:41.301
You guys made a bunch
of dick jokes earlier.

13:41.368 --> 13:42.302
No, we did not.

13:42.369 --> 13:44.304
Now we have a lady here--
there were no dick jokes.

13:44.371 --> 13:46.306
You guys threw me your
dick and I threw it back.

13:46.373 --> 13:47.307
What?!

13:47.374 --> 13:48.374
What are you talking about?

13:48.443 --> 13:50.376
How would you even throw a dick?

13:50.445 --> 13:51.377
Hey, baby.

13:51.446 --> 13:51.978
Hey. Hey.

13:52.046 --> 13:52.979
We should probably head off.

13:53.047 --> 13:55.315
You're not heading off anywhere.

13:55.382 --> 13:57.551
Um, okay... This is
really fun over here.

13:57.618 --> 13:59.753
You know, their sausage has <i>meat in it!</i>

13:59.821 --> 14:01.755
<i>Hey, speaking of meat...
Get your ass back to that</i>

14:01.823 --> 14:02.756
<i>grill and shut up.</i>

14:02.824 --> 14:04.758
<i>Look, let me just use your
bathroom, and then we'll figure</i>

14:04.826 --> 14:05.592
<i>out what we're gonna do.</i>

14:05.660 --> 14:06.593
<i>Uh-uh, absolutely not.</i>

14:06.661 --> 14:08.595
<i>No, you don't understand, I'm
at the two-minute warning</i>

14:08.663 --> 14:10.597
<i>here-- I need to get in
there, I need to do a little</i>

14:54.274 --> 14:55.942
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

14:56.010 --> 14:59.513
<i>All right, here are the rules:
two-hand touch... Two-hand tackle.</i>

14:59.580 --> 15:00.514
<i>That is</i> touch.

15:00.581 --> 15:02.616
Nope. I'm gonna tackle
you with my hands, Pete.

15:02.683 --> 15:04.718
I just want everyone to know
that I'm temporarily lifting the

15:04.785 --> 15:07.521
restraining order and I'm
gonna install a safe word.

15:07.588 --> 15:09.723
So if I ever feel uncomfortable
during the game, I'm gonna say

15:09.790 --> 15:13.393
"Fidelio"-- that's my safe word-- and
you guys will know what to do, right?

15:13.460 --> 15:15.896
Okay, actually, I don't
want you covering me.

15:15.963 --> 15:19.232
So I'm gonna switch here with you.

15:20.968 --> 15:23.570
Tug, you want to get some seed out
of Gibiatti before you start?

15:23.638 --> 15:25.572
Yeah, we can warm up that way.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.207
No, we don't warm up that way,
no, we don't warm up that way.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.208
Just kidding. Just playing.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.209
He is messing with you.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.244
The game's gonna start in 20

15:31.311 --> 15:33.813
minutes-- if you're gonna play,
just do it, start, okay?

15:33.881 --> 15:35.081
Just, let's just do it.

15:35.149 --> 15:36.650
Hut! Hike!

15:36.717 --> 15:37.717
Flea flicker!

15:37.785 --> 15:40.420
(various shouts)

15:40.487 --> 15:41.655
Oh! Touchdown!

15:41.722 --> 15:42.756
(others shouting)

15:42.823 --> 15:44.591
Soldier! Yeah! Soldier!

15:44.659 --> 15:47.093
No! No! Dude, we talked about
this-- we're doing this dance.

15:47.161 --> 15:48.094
I know, yeah, yeah.

15:48.162 --> 15:50.096
You're doing this weird thing.
Wise up! Wise up!

15:50.164 --> 15:52.866
It's a celebration da... No! No!

15:52.934 --> 15:54.868
All right, here we go, here we go.

15:54.936 --> 15:58.538
All right, let's go.

15:58.606 --> 15:59.573
Peach cobbler. Peach cobbler.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.441
Peach cobbler. All right.

16:01.508 --> 16:03.743
Ready, hut... What are you doing?

16:03.811 --> 16:04.744
It's not a hand signal, man.

16:04.812 --> 16:07.614
When I put my hand between your legs,
I want the ball, not your hand.

16:07.682 --> 16:08.615
Oh, okay.

16:08.683 --> 16:10.249
Jesus Christ.
Hut!

16:10.317 --> 16:11.517
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

16:11.586 --> 16:12.586
What?

16:12.653 --> 16:15.055
FYI, happy dicks, I
just seeded your ball.

16:15.122 --> 16:16.089
(others groaning)

16:16.156 --> 16:18.592
I just seeded your football, soldier!

16:18.659 --> 16:19.593
Seeded!

16:19.660 --> 16:20.594
You're touching it!

16:20.661 --> 16:21.628
Down, hike!

16:21.696 --> 16:23.063
Guard him!

16:23.130 --> 16:24.263
No, no, no, no, no, no!

16:24.331 --> 16:26.365
Come on! He's wide open!

16:26.433 --> 16:27.901
Check it out!

16:27.969 --> 16:31.571
Wah-bah-bah-bah, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:31.639 --> 16:33.406
Oh! I got it!

16:33.474 --> 16:34.641
You want it?

16:34.709 --> 16:36.442
No. No.

16:36.510 --> 16:39.278
Fidelio! Fidelio!

16:39.346 --> 16:41.781
No! Fidelio!

16:41.849 --> 16:43.583
Hut!

16:43.651 --> 16:44.584
(grunting)

16:44.652 --> 16:45.585
Where you going?

16:45.653 --> 16:47.220
All right, it's two-hand touch, okay?

16:47.287 --> 16:48.221
Can you get off me, please?

16:48.288 --> 16:49.222
Do you not like it?

16:49.289 --> 16:50.256
Is it too much for you?

16:50.324 --> 16:51.324
(loud grunt)

16:51.391 --> 16:53.426
Oh! You just got seeded, kid!

16:53.494 --> 16:54.327
That's bullshit, man.

16:54.394 --> 16:55.061
That was a cheap shot.

16:55.129 --> 16:56.062
Fidelio.

16:56.130 --> 16:58.164
It's like you said, two-hand
tackle <i>is</i> touch, bitch.

16:58.232 --> 16:59.165
Come on.

16:59.233 --> 17:00.266
That's what I'm talking about!

17:00.334 --> 17:02.268
No, it's a chest bump, not a hug.

17:02.336 --> 17:03.269
That's how we do, man!

17:03.337 --> 17:04.270
No, that's not how we do.

17:04.338 --> 17:05.271
You know what?

17:05.339 --> 17:06.271
Five-minute halftime.

17:06.339 --> 17:08.340
Andre's hurt-- I'm gonna go get
him some ice and, you know, a

17:08.407 --> 17:09.075
magazine or something.

17:09.143 --> 17:10.076
<i>Details,</i> please?

17:10.144 --> 17:12.244
No! Not <i>Details,</i> you loser.

17:19.977 --> 17:22.299
Vatos Locos? Anyone here?

17:22.559 --> 17:23.540
All right.

17:23.661 --> 17:26.848
Well, stinker-tinker time.

17:26.916 --> 17:28.817
(sighs): All righty.

17:28.886 --> 17:32.922
And get the lineup in order.

17:32.990 --> 17:36.859
What's this?

17:37.338 --> 17:38.971
What the hell is that?

17:39.039 --> 17:41.841
Is that a peephole?

17:41.909 --> 17:43.142
That's a peephole.

17:43.262 --> 17:45.978
(gasps) Gibiatti, for shame.

17:46.046 --> 17:49.649
I got to go tell Jenny, but
first I'm just gonna... set my

17:49.717 --> 17:53.066
lineup and drop a stinker.

17:53.186 --> 17:54.320
Let's go, ladies.

17:54.387 --> 17:55.488
Let's go, let's go.

17:55.556 --> 17:56.221
This game's over.

17:56.289 --> 17:57.222
That one's about to start.

17:57.290 --> 17:58.223
Keep your heads in the game.

17:58.291 --> 17:59.224
We still got this.

17:59.292 --> 18:01.226
We need one more touchdown and we win.

18:01.294 --> 18:02.227
Okay, guys, I'm out.

18:02.295 --> 18:02.829
I can't play.

18:02.896 --> 18:03.830
Jesus Christ!

18:03.897 --> 18:06.065
Jenny, Little Lord Fauntleroy
over here is wussing out.

18:06.132 --> 18:07.066
We need a new player.

18:07.133 --> 18:07.667
What?!

18:07.734 --> 18:08.901
It's an upgrade, anyway.

18:08.969 --> 18:10.903
Just because I can't be out
there on the field, I want you

18:10.971 --> 18:14.273
to win this one-- win it for the Dre Tones.
The Dre... Ow! Oh!

18:14.341 --> 18:15.475
Just sit down. God!

18:15.542 --> 18:16.476
Babe, are you okay?

18:16.543 --> 18:17.477
I'm fine. (belches)

18:17.544 --> 18:18.478
Oh!

18:18.545 --> 18:19.479
Ooh, that smells horrible.

18:19.546 --> 18:20.179
It tasted horrible.

18:20.246 --> 18:22.414
Maybe you shouldn't have eaten
the old burger tartare?

18:22.483 --> 18:24.951
I'm okay. Look, I will treat you
like a lady for the rest of

18:25.018 --> 18:26.953
your life if you just
man up this one time.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.622
I just went and used their bathroom--
there's a peephole in there.

18:29.690 --> 18:30.623
Where?

18:30.691 --> 18:31.624
Eh!

18:31.692 --> 18:32.625
Wait, they watched me pee?

18:32.693 --> 18:34.252
Yeah, or flick your bean...
No, I didn't do that!

18:34.492 --> 18:36.093
Frank! I can't believe you!

18:36.160 --> 18:37.427
You watched me pee?

18:37.495 --> 18:39.429
It's "the Body," first
of all, and yes, I did.

18:39.497 --> 18:41.431
You were treating me like a lady.

18:41.499 --> 18:43.433
And I watch ladies pee... Oh!

18:43.501 --> 18:44.434
He watches every lady pee.

18:44.502 --> 18:45.435
Not every lady.

18:45.503 --> 18:47.437
That's the only way he can get hard.

18:47.505 --> 18:48.438
No, it is not.

18:48.506 --> 18:49.873
Oh, God, you are disgusting!

18:49.940 --> 18:51.875
You are a lucky man-- you've
got a nice, hydrated wife.

18:51.942 --> 18:52.876
(Kevin grunts threateningly)

18:52.943 --> 18:53.877
Deal with it. Pull it in.

18:53.944 --> 18:54.878
Bring it in, bring it in.

18:54.945 --> 18:55.512
I am in, guys.

18:55.579 --> 18:56.513
I want to kick their asses.

18:56.580 --> 18:58.515
All right, guys, let's keep
this simple, all right?

18:58.582 --> 18:59.516
Kevin, it's coming to you.

18:59.583 --> 19:00.150
Can you handle it?

19:00.218 --> 19:01.151
(grunts): Uh-huh.

19:01.219 --> 19:02.152
You're on the ball.

19:02.220 --> 19:03.153
I am on the Body.

19:03.221 --> 19:05.788
Come on, Dre Tones, bring that
Motown sound back to Dre Town!

19:05.856 --> 19:07.557
Oh, shut up, Andre.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.226
What? Come on.

19:09.293 --> 19:10.394
Hey.

19:10.461 --> 19:11.395
Hey, Tac... Whoa!

19:11.462 --> 19:12.565
Jim McMahon!

19:12.685 --> 19:14.031
Oh, do you guys not know each other?

19:14.098 --> 19:17.034
What? How do you... Jim and Taco Corp
are getting into business together.

19:17.101 --> 19:19.036
We're gonna sell these fine
T-shirts all over the world.

19:19.103 --> 19:20.803
Yeah, we're gonna make a fortune.

19:20.871 --> 19:23.140
Yeah, gonna get that European
market with the soccer ball, the

19:23.207 --> 19:25.675
'70s stash gonna get that porn market.

19:25.743 --> 19:26.809
Shades for the stoner market.

19:26.877 --> 19:27.810
Biggest market of all.

19:27.878 --> 19:28.811
Wow.

19:28.879 --> 19:30.813
We're gonna get you
that second nut, kid.

19:30.881 --> 19:32.815
All right. Have I told
you I made my nut?

19:32.883 --> 19:34.418
Yes, you told me you made your nut.

19:34.485 --> 19:35.419
He made his nut.

19:35.486 --> 19:36.420
Yeah, I know!

19:36.487 --> 19:37.487
Oh! Hey! All right, guys!

19:37.555 --> 19:38.522
Blue 42!

19:38.589 --> 19:39.556
Watch your ass, Gibiatti.

19:39.623 --> 19:40.557
I'm coming for you.

19:40.624 --> 19:42.725
Why? So you can pee on me, <i>milady?</i>

19:42.793 --> 19:43.726
<i>He'd drink it.</i>

19:43.794 --> 19:44.727
<i>No, I would not drink it.</i>

19:44.795 --> 19:45.728
<i>Never would drink it.</i>

19:45.796 --> 19:47.730
<i>You can get sick that
way, you idiot,</i> Tug.

19:47.798 --> 19:48.365
Good, Kev?

19:48.433 --> 19:49.366
(Kevin grunts)

19:49.434 --> 19:51.000
Hut! Hike!

19:51.069 --> 19:52.835
Ball! Ball! I'm open!

19:52.903 --> 19:53.836
Go, Kevin, go!

19:53.904 --> 19:54.837
(grunting)

19:54.905 --> 19:56.239
Now, that's how a lady hits!

19:56.307 --> 19:57.240
Kevin, go!

19:57.308 --> 19:58.442
Go, you goddamn silverback!

19:58.509 --> 20:01.711
MacArthur's on the 15, he's on
the ten, he's on the five...

20:01.779 --> 20:03.180
Where you going, soldier?

20:03.247 --> 20:06.083
(Kevin retching)

20:06.150 --> 20:10.387
He's evacuated his stomach
on the oncoming predator!

20:10.455 --> 20:12.722
(Kevin retching)

20:12.790 --> 20:13.923
He seeded the Seed!

20:13.991 --> 20:15.258
He seeded the Seed!

20:15.326 --> 20:16.393
He seeded the Seed!

20:16.461 --> 20:18.395
Boy, that's a great idea for a T-shirt.

20:18.463 --> 20:20.697
Oh, my throat... Aw, how's
the Body, Gibiatti?

20:20.764 --> 20:22.799
(coughs): Oh, God, my life.

20:22.866 --> 20:23.967
I blew it.

20:24.034 --> 20:25.635
Yeah! Yes!

20:25.703 --> 20:28.538
(Kevin grunting)

20:28.606 --> 20:29.539
(retching)

20:29.607 --> 20:31.541
