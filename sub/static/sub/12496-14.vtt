00:21.083 --> 00:24.625

00:24.667 --> 00:27.375
Luckily, Captain Man

00:24.667 --> 00:27.375
arrived on the scene.

00:30.834 --> 00:33.000

00:30.834 --> 00:33.000
the city of Swellview

00:33.041 --> 00:34.917

They took Billy, Nora,

01:01.959 --> 01:03.542

01:03.583 --> 01:07.125
No, no, no, it's the third

01:03.583 --> 01:07.125

01:17.625 --> 01:19.875
- Uhhh...

01:17.625 --> 01:19.875
what do you mean?

01:19.917 --> 01:21.917
- You're confused

01:19.917 --> 01:21.917
by the question,

01:21.959 --> 01:24.083
"Where are you going?"

01:24.125 --> 01:26.041
- I, uhhh...

01:24.125 --> 01:26.041
going to Cherry's house.

01:26.083 --> 01:28.000
- Hmm, I thought

01:26.083 --> 01:28.000
Cherry has the flu.

01:28.041 --> 01:30.333
- She does.

01:30.375 --> 01:33.375
Which is why

01:30.375 --> 01:33.375
I'm bringing her this...

01:33.417 --> 01:36.125
chicken soup.

01:36.166 --> 01:39.458
- You put soup

01:36.166 --> 01:39.458
in a suitcase?

01:39.500 --> 01:43.083
- Yes, Max.

01:39.500 --> 01:43.083
That's what nice people do.

01:43.125 --> 01:45.083
When our friends

01:43.125 --> 01:45.083
are sick, we...

01:45.125 --> 01:48.583
we fill a suitcase with soup,

01:45.125 --> 01:48.583
and we bring it to them,

01:48.625 --> 01:51.667
which you would know

01:48.625 --> 01:51.667
if you were a good per--

01:51.709 --> 01:53.625
Max!

01:53.667 --> 01:55.834
- "Girly pajama top" soup.

01:58.583 --> 02:00.208

01:58.583 --> 02:00.208

02:00.250 --> 02:02.917
- Kinda.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.917
- Come with me.

02:03.250 --> 02:06.250
- I knew there was no soup.

02:06.291 --> 02:09.291
- Captain Man and Kid Danger,

02:06.291 --> 02:09.291
how many criminals

02:09.333 --> 02:11.000
have you battled

02:09.333 --> 02:11.000
since this unexpected

02:11.041 --> 02:13.000
crime wave began here

02:11.041 --> 02:13.000
in Swellview?

02:13.041 --> 02:14.250
- I uh, I-- I dunno...

02:14.291 --> 02:16.333
- A lot.

02:14.291 --> 02:16.333
Oh God, we're so tired.

02:16.375 --> 02:19.208
- Why am I watching this?

02:16.375 --> 02:19.208
- Just shh. Look.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.625
- And do you think

02:19.250 --> 02:21.625
it's getting worse, or do--

02:21.667 --> 02:22.709
- Ahhh!

02:21.667 --> 02:22.709
Gimme that microphone!

02:22.750 --> 02:24.458
Give it to me!

02:22.750 --> 02:24.458
I want your microphone!

02:24.500 --> 02:27.333
[shouting]

02:30.583 --> 02:31.709
- Give me that!

02:31.750 --> 02:33.959
Here you go.

02:34.000 --> 02:34.834
[shouts]

02:37.041 --> 02:39.625
[panting]

02:39.667 --> 02:41.125
- And how did you react

02:39.667 --> 02:41.125
when you heard

02:41.166 --> 02:43.291
that Doctor Minyak

02:41.166 --> 02:43.291
regained his memory

02:43.333 --> 02:44.250
and escaped from

02:43.333 --> 02:44.250
Swellview prison?

02:44.291 --> 02:46.166
- What?

02:46.208 --> 02:48.792
- Doctor Minyak escaped?

02:48.834 --> 02:50.959
- Dang it!

02:48.834 --> 02:50.959
- Aw, come on, let's just go!

02:51.000 --> 02:53.834
- Awww...

02:51.000 --> 02:53.834
God, I hate crime waves.

02:54.417 --> 02:58.709
- Whoa, Doctor Minyak

02:54.417 --> 02:58.709
busted outta prison?

02:58.750 --> 03:01.000
- That would excite you.

03:01.041 --> 03:03.458
- Uh yeah.

03:01.041 --> 03:03.458
He invented the Heliometer.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.041
- What's a "Heliometer?"

03:05.083 --> 03:07.125
- It's a device

03:05.083 --> 03:07.125
that temporarily converts

03:07.166 --> 03:09.458
a person's oxygen molecules to

03:07.166 --> 03:09.458
helium, so they float up off

03:09.500 --> 03:11.333
the ground, and it makes

03:09.500 --> 03:11.333
their voice really high

03:11.375 --> 03:14.333
so they sound stupid.

03:14.375 --> 03:16.750
- You have your own powers that

03:14.375 --> 03:16.750
can lift people off the ground.

03:16.792 --> 03:18.875
- Yeah, but the Heliometer

03:16.792 --> 03:18.875
can lift cars,

03:18.917 --> 03:20.917
buildings,

03:18.917 --> 03:20.917
pretty much anything.

03:20.959 --> 03:23.667
With a device like that,

03:20.959 --> 03:23.667
I could take over the world.

03:23.709 --> 03:25.333
- And then what, Max?

03:25.375 --> 03:27.333
If you could take over

03:25.375 --> 03:27.333
the world, what would you do?

03:27.375 --> 03:30.750
- Uh, nothing, 'cuz I'd make

03:27.375 --> 03:30.750
everyone do stuff for me.

03:30.792 --> 03:33.250
- Look, there is a huge crime

03:30.792 --> 03:33.250
wave in Swellview,

03:33.291 --> 03:35.792
and I'm gonna go help.

03:35.834 --> 03:39.959
- Okay, well I guess I'll

03:35.834 --> 03:39.959
just call Mom and Dad

03:40.000 --> 03:41.500
and tell them you're leaving

03:40.000 --> 03:41.500
town without their permission,

03:41.542 --> 03:44.500
then you're gonna be

03:41.542 --> 03:44.500
in a lot of trou...

03:44.542 --> 03:46.333
Whoa!

03:46.375 --> 03:48.792
Okay, put me down.

03:48.834 --> 03:51.083
- I will, when you promise

03:48.834 --> 03:51.083
not to tell Mom, Dad,

03:51.125 --> 03:52.333
or anyone else that

03:51.125 --> 03:52.333
I went away to...

03:52.375 --> 03:55.458
- Whoa!

03:55.500 --> 03:57.166
Put me down.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.125
- I will, right after

03:57.208 --> 03:59.125
you put me down!

03:59.166 --> 04:00.542
- Okay, fine.

04:00.583 --> 04:01.834
On three, we'll put

04:00.583 --> 04:01.834
each other down.

04:01.875 --> 04:02.667
- Okay.

04:01.875 --> 04:02.667
- One...

04:02.709 --> 04:05.500
- Two...

04:02.709 --> 04:05.500
- Three!

04:08.000 --> 04:09.750
- Okay, that really hurt.

04:09.792 --> 04:12.375
- Didn't hurt me.

04:12.417 --> 04:13.542
Heh...

04:15.792 --> 04:17.083
Okay, that really hurt.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.083
- Hey, if you were Dr. Minyak,

04:30.125 --> 04:31.917
and you just broke

04:30.125 --> 04:31.917
out of prison,

04:31.959 --> 04:34.083
where would you hide?

04:34.125 --> 04:36.625
- I don't know.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.625
Omar's Pizza?

04:36.667 --> 04:39.458
- Why Omar's Pizza?

04:39.500 --> 04:40.834
- They have good pizza?

04:40.875 --> 04:42.083
- You wanna order one?

04:42.125 --> 04:45.417

04:46.917 --> 04:51.000

04:51.041 --> 04:52.667

05:01.208 --> 05:03.125
so bummed out about?

05:04.625 --> 05:05.709
- I can't tell you.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.000
He's worried

05:05.750 --> 05:07.000
you'll laugh at him.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.750
- I would never laugh

C'mon, what's goin' on?
