15:18.125 --> 15:19.960
<i>You know the trouble he's in.</i>

15:20.002 --> 15:21.879
<i>Wanted to ask
if he'd talked to you</i>

15:21.921 --> 15:24.006
<i>about what might've happened
at the mill.</i>

15:24.048 --> 15:25.215
<i>Maybe he left something out</i>

15:25.257 --> 15:28.594
<i>when he spoke to me
that could help him.</i>

15:28.636 --> 15:29.595
<i>No.</i>

15:29.678 --> 15:31.597
<i>No, he didn't
leave something out?</i>

15:31.639 --> 15:34.058
<i>No, he didn't tell me anything.</i>

15:34.099 --> 15:35.768
<i>So then you probably don't know</i>

15:35.851 --> 15:37.519
<i>if anyone else
was there with him.</i>

15:37.561 --> 15:38.604
<i>How would I?</i>

15:38.687 --> 15:40.856
<i>Did you ever see him sell
or do any drugs?</i>

15:40.898 --> 15:42.816
<i>You know as well as I do</i>

15:42.900 --> 15:47.571
<i>that Billy had nothing
to do with drugs, ever.</i>

15:48.113 --> 15:51.200
<i>Right. Okay then.</i>

15:51.867 --> 15:56.664
<i>Either of you happen to hear
from Isaac recently?</i>

15:56.705 --> 15:58.082
<i>No, we have not.</i>

15:58.123 --> 16:00.876
<i>Can you remind me
exactly when he left town?</i>

16:00.918 --> 16:03.504
<i>I don't think
it's any of your business</i>

16:03.587 --> 16:04.797
<i>when my son does anything.</i>

16:04.838 --> 16:06.215
<i>And if you're suggesting</i>

16:06.256 --> 16:09.843
<i>he had something to do
with what went on at the mill,</i>

16:09.885 --> 16:11.887
<i>that's interesting,
because I heard</i>

16:11.971 --> 16:13.097
<i>you got kicked off that case.</i>

16:13.180 --> 16:15.683
<i>If you want to talk to us
about anything,</i>

16:15.766 --> 16:17.977
<i>you go and get yourself
a warrant.</i>

16:18.018 --> 16:19.311
<i>Good luck with that.</i>

16:19.395 --> 16:24.316
<i>Till then, step off my property,
leave my family alone.</i>

16:27.194 --> 16:28.529
<i>I hear you, Henry.</i>

16:28.570 --> 16:30.489
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

16:30.531 --> 16:32.700
<i>Lee.</i>

16:45.504 --> 16:46.714
<i>Officer.</i>

16:46.797 --> 16:48.340
<i>Chief. Harris.</i>

16:48.424 --> 16:49.341
<i>Sorry.</i>

16:49.425 --> 16:51.343
<i>Right.</i>

16:51.885 --> 16:53.887
<i>Tom, come on down.</i>

16:53.971 --> 16:55.723
<i>Say hello to Chief Harris.</i>

17:01.395 --> 17:03.480
<i>Oh. Um...</i>

17:04.148 --> 17:07.192
<i>Teenagers in the neighborhood...</i>

17:13.157 --> 17:14.908
<i>How you feeling, Tom?</i>

17:14.992 --> 17:16.076
<i>All right.</i>

17:16.118 --> 17:18.328
<i>Um, kind of confused,
to tell you the truth.</i>

17:18.412 --> 17:21.290
<i>Mel says you told her
you'd put in a good word</i>

17:21.331 --> 17:22.791
<i>with child welfare if she talked</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:24.084
<i>-with you at the hospital.
- Tom. Don't.</i>

17:24.126 --> 17:26.795
<i>But we still
ain't got our kids back.</i>

17:26.837 --> 17:27.713
<i>He's upset.</i>

17:27.755 --> 17:31.675
<i>We both... We miss them is all.</i>

17:31.717 --> 17:32.968
<i>You can understand that.</i>

17:33.010 --> 17:36.346
<i>I did tell child services
that Melanie was cooperative.</i>

17:36.430 --> 17:38.640
<i>Now that you've woken up,
it's your turn.</i>

17:38.682 --> 17:40.309
<i>Uh, your wife ID'd this man</i>

17:40.350 --> 17:42.227
<i>as the last person
you bought drugs from.</i>

17:42.269 --> 17:44.563
<i>You agree with that?</i>

17:45.939 --> 17:47.399
<i>You know his name?</i>

17:47.441 --> 17:48.567
<i>No.</i>

17:48.609 --> 17:49.735
<i>You bought from him,</i>

17:49.818 --> 17:51.320
<i>but you have no idea
what his name is?</i>

17:51.361 --> 17:53.864
<i>He was a dealer,
not my fuckin' BFF.</i>

17:53.947 --> 17:57.409
<i>It was just the one time.</i>

17:59.078 --> 18:00.245
<i>How about him?</i>

18:00.287 --> 18:01.997
<i>Do I know his name?</i>

18:02.081 --> 18:03.957
<i>-Sure.
I do.</i>

18:04.041 --> 18:05.417
<i>I guess you
probably know it, too,</i>

18:05.501 --> 18:08.003
<i>-since he used to work for you.
- Tom. Cut it out.</i>

18:08.045 --> 18:09.004
<i>Pete Novick.</i>

18:09.046 --> 18:10.839
<i>Did you ever use with Pete?</i>

18:10.923 --> 18:12.049
<i>Use with him? No. He sold.</i>

18:12.091 --> 18:14.843
<i>Pete Novick
used to be your dealer?</i>

18:14.885 --> 18:16.637
<i>He was a dealer.</i>

18:16.678 --> 18:18.055
<i>This is what I keep saying,</i>

18:18.097 --> 18:19.306
<i>time and again.</i>

18:19.348 --> 18:21.100
<i>Every once in a long while,</i>

18:21.183 --> 18:22.267
<i>we'd score a little coke,</i>

18:22.351 --> 18:24.144
<i>from Pete,
when we wanted to party.</i>

18:24.228 --> 18:26.021
<i>Just a little bit a coke,
that's all.</i>

18:26.105 --> 18:27.314
<i>All right. Enough.</i>

18:27.397 --> 18:29.233
<i>"Every once in a long while"
does not normally include</i>

18:29.274 --> 18:31.151
<i>"while watching our son
play Little League."</i>

18:31.193 --> 18:32.945
<i>Now I don't happen
to give a shit whether or not</i>

18:33.028 --> 18:34.321
<i>the two of you
have a drug problem,</i>

18:34.404 --> 18:36.240
<i>or why-- when you're
trying to get your kids back--</i>

18:36.281 --> 18:38.283
<i>you're chugging PBRs
on your front lawn.</i>

18:38.367 --> 18:39.952
<i>But I am here
to get some answers,</i>

18:40.035 --> 18:42.246
<i>and I can make your lives
pretty goddamn difficult</i>

18:42.329 --> 18:44.665
<i>if you want
to keep playing this game.</i>

18:49.837 --> 18:53.924
<i>Before you OD'd, did you ever
buy cocaine mixed with anything?</i>

18:54.424 --> 18:57.302
<i>Novick tried to get me
to let him</i>

18:57.386 --> 19:01.974
<i>sprinkle in a little something
extra-- some opioid something--</i>

19:02.015 --> 19:04.309
<i>but I know folks get addicted
to that crap,</i>

19:04.393 --> 19:05.853
<i>so I kept telling him no.</i>

19:05.894 --> 19:07.312
<i>What opioid?</i>

19:07.855 --> 19:10.440
<i>Uh, some, uh...</i>

19:10.524 --> 19:11.275
<i>Fentanyl?</i>

19:11.358 --> 19:13.902
<i>Yeah. That's the one.</i>

19:13.944 --> 19:15.571
<i>Told me he had
a prescription for it.</i>

19:15.654 --> 19:17.948
<i>That's how I was supposed
to know it was grade A shit.</i>

19:17.990 --> 19:20.325
<i>Do you know where he got
the prescription filled?</i>

19:20.409 --> 19:22.494
<i>Where do you fill
a prescription?</i>

19:22.536 --> 19:24.580
<i>-A pharmacy, I guess.
- Tom.</i>

19:24.621 --> 19:28.584
<i>All I know is this new guy
starts coming around,</i>

19:28.667 --> 19:30.961
<i>saying he's taking over
Pete's territory,</i>

19:31.044 --> 19:34.631
<i>and we ain't got
our kids no more.</i>

19:38.010 --> 19:39.469
<i>And I'm sleeping.
You can feel it.</i>

19:39.553 --> 19:42.014
<i>So I looked up. She just
standing over me like this...</i>

19:54.359 --> 19:56.278
<i>suspenseful music</i>

20:16.548 --> 20:18.800
<i>suspenseful music</i>

20:27.726 --> 20:29.728
<i>Yeah, all right. Thanks.</i>

20:29.770 --> 20:31.313
<i>Jackson, my friend.</i>

20:31.355 --> 20:32.981
<i>He said he could email it,</i>

20:33.065 --> 20:36.026
<i>but I told him
the old way worked fine.</i>

20:37.611 --> 20:39.279
<i>The codeine works
better for you?</i>

20:39.321 --> 20:41.949
Oh, that tramadol
had me stopped up so bad

20:42.032 --> 20:44.159
<i>I went to the ER.
I'm still not going</i>

20:44.243 --> 20:47.579
<i>every day, but this is better.</i>

20:48.247 --> 20:49.206
<i>Thanks, buddy.</i>

20:49.248 --> 20:50.290
<i>Got to run.</i>

20:50.374 --> 20:53.085
<i>Yeah, no problem.
See you around.</i>

21:01.802 --> 21:03.804
<i>Where you been, man?</i>

21:03.887 --> 21:06.598
<i>Long, long drive.</i>

21:11.937 --> 21:13.730
<i>Okay, cool.</i>

21:13.772 --> 21:15.774
<i>We're good.</i>

21:16.817 --> 21:18.110
<i>You made me late.</i>

21:18.193 --> 21:20.070
<i>It's been a pleasure.</i>

21:26.285 --> 21:27.703
<i>I heard him talking
all kinds of smack</i>

21:27.786 --> 21:30.163
<i>-about rushing for 200 yards.
No way.</i>

21:30.205 --> 21:32.749
<i>Bumping at the gums
will only get you hurt.</i>

21:32.791 --> 21:34.334
<i>I'm gonna hit
that motherfucker so hard,</i>

21:34.418 --> 21:35.794
<i>it's gonna send him
back in time.</i>

21:35.836 --> 21:37.337
<i>-Back to his fucking childhood.</i>

21:37.379 --> 21:39.965
<i>Oh, Mama, that Black man hit me.</i>

21:40.966 --> 21:42.467
<i>Hey, yo. What're we here to do?</i>

21:42.551 --> 21:44.970
Flex these pecs
and snap some necks!

21:45.053 --> 21:45.846
<i>Let's go!</i>

21:45.929 --> 21:47.347
<i>-Come on.</i>

21:47.389 --> 21:48.724
<i>I'm flyer than Beetlejuice</i>

21:48.765 --> 21:50.475
<i>Don't count on the sheep
to snooze</i>

21:50.559 --> 21:51.935
<i>I'm fucked up
off weed and booze</i>

21:52.019 --> 21:53.103
<i>I party then sleep till noon</i>

21:53.186 --> 21:54.313
<i>What everyday people do</i>

21:54.396 --> 21:55.522
<i>So haters see me improve</i>

21:55.564 --> 21:57.107
<i>Just give me a week or two</i>

21:57.190 --> 21:58.150
<i>See when you read
the news...</i>

21:58.191 --> 21:59.109
<i>Hey, yo, Chris.</i>

21:59.151 --> 22:00.235
<i>What up, T?</i>

22:00.277 --> 22:01.445
<i>You mind taking this in for me?</i>

22:01.528 --> 22:02.696
<i>I got you.
- I'll be right there.</i>

22:02.779 --> 22:03.905
<i>All right.</i>

22:03.989 --> 22:05.782
<i>This that old-school shit,
soundin' good in the ride</i>

22:05.824 --> 22:08.201
<i>And fuck ten,
I'm only countin' to nine</i>

22:08.243 --> 22:09.828
<i>Said this
that old-school shit</i>

22:09.911 --> 22:12.831
<i>Soundin' good in the ride,
so let's head out</i>

22:12.914 --> 22:14.291
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

22:14.374 --> 22:16.835
<i>How much you want?</i>

22:22.883 --> 22:24.801
<i>Whatever this gets.</i>

22:33.060 --> 22:34.853
<i>You want more on credit?</i>

22:35.354 --> 22:38.732
<i>I'm okay. It's just me
and my girlfriend.</i>

22:43.987 --> 22:45.447
<i>You can go.</i>

22:45.489 --> 22:48.116
<i>Right.</i>

22:48.158 --> 22:50.660
<i>Thanks, man.</i>

22:54.664 --> 22:55.916
<i>I have 47 clients.</i>

22:55.957 --> 22:58.335
<i>It's not my job
to get moms on visitors' lists.</i>

22:58.418 --> 23:00.295
<i>It's my job
to get sons out of prison.</i>

23:00.379 --> 23:02.964
<i>Okay. Can you at least call me
as soon as you've seen him?</i>

23:03.048 --> 23:04.716
<i>That's not my job, either.</i>

23:04.800 --> 23:07.719
<i>Once he signs the papers,
he's my client, not you.</i>

23:07.803 --> 23:10.055
<i>-Can you just call me?
- Grace.</i>

23:10.138 --> 23:12.766
<i>Rachel. Do you have kids?</i>

23:12.849 --> 23:14.142
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

23:14.226 --> 23:15.477
<i>Okay. Well,
then you'll understand</i>

23:15.519 --> 23:17.187
<i>why I'm gonna call you
20 times a day</i>

23:17.270 --> 23:18.480
<i>and into the night
until you answer</i>

23:18.522 --> 23:19.689
<i>and tell me how my son's doing.</i>

23:19.773 --> 23:21.525
<i>I would come camp out
at your office,</i>

23:21.566 --> 23:23.193
<i>but I don't have a car
to get there,</i>

23:23.235 --> 23:26.154
<i>so this is the next best thing.</i>

23:26.238 --> 23:27.906
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:27.989 --> 23:29.908
<i>Okay.</i>

23:44.256 --> 23:47.551
<i></i>

23:50.512 --> 23:53.014
<i>Lawyer's here, Poe. Let's go.</i>

23:53.056 --> 23:56.101
<i>Hey. Don't make me say it again.</i>

23:56.143 --> 23:58.311
<i>I'm not interested.</i>

23:58.353 --> 24:00.564
<i>Excuse me?</i>

24:00.605 --> 24:02.274
<i>Tell her to go home.
I'm not interested.</i>

24:02.357 --> 24:04.067
<i>You're a fucking moron.</i>

24:14.453 --> 24:16.621
<i>You protecting somebody?</i>

24:23.462 --> 24:25.464
<i>slow, tense music</i>

27:27.562 --> 27:30.315
<i>I think you lied to me.</i>

27:56.007 --> 27:57.759
<i>Can I help you?</i>

27:57.801 --> 27:59.636
<i>It's Rachel.</i>

28:00.136 --> 28:03.932
<i>-Public defender Rachel.
- Oh, shit. Hi.</i>

28:03.973 --> 28:05.600
<i>When you said
you didn't have a car,</i>

28:05.684 --> 28:08.853
<i>I didn't realize it was
'cause yours looked like this.</i>

28:08.895 --> 28:10.563
<i>Welcome to my world.</i>

28:10.647 --> 28:11.815
<i>What happened?</i>

28:11.856 --> 28:14.234
<i>Trying to unionize
the factory I work at.</i>

28:14.275 --> 28:16.611
<i>I don't know if it's related
to my job or my son.</i>

28:16.695 --> 28:18.571
<i>I'm not making
a lot of friends these days.</i>

28:18.613 --> 28:21.324
<i>-Is everything okay?
- Not really.</i>

28:21.366 --> 28:23.076
<i>Your son is refusing to see me.</i>

28:23.118 --> 28:25.412
<i>I can't be his lawyer
until he signs the papers.</i>

28:25.495 --> 28:26.454
<i>Why won't he see you?</i>

28:26.496 --> 28:28.415
<i>I was hoping you'd tell me.</i>

28:28.498 --> 28:31.626
<i>He knows
he's supposed to talk to you.</i>

28:31.668 --> 28:32.794
<i>You'll be on the visitors' list</i>

28:32.877 --> 28:34.462
<i>sometime within the next 24 hours.</i>

28:34.546 --> 28:36.673
<i>The second you get in,
you tell him</i>

28:36.756 --> 28:38.675
<i>-that he needs to meet with me.
- I'll-I'll...</i>

28:38.758 --> 28:41.052
<i>I'll talk to him. I'll fix it.</i>

28:41.136 --> 28:43.012
<i>Please do.</i>

28:46.558 --> 28:49.227
<i>You could've just called,
you know.</i>

28:49.269 --> 28:50.520
<i>I know.</i>

28:50.562 --> 28:54.524
<i>It's decent of you
to come all this way.</i>

28:54.607 --> 28:56.735
<i>It's good to know
my son's going to be represented</i>

28:56.818 --> 29:00.238
<i>by someone... decent.</i>

29:05.285 --> 29:07.412
<i>You get what I sent?</i>

29:09.956 --> 29:12.625
For a guy who says
he doesn't handle much fentanyl,

29:12.709 --> 29:14.377
<i>Jackson handles a fuckload</i>

29:14.461 --> 29:15.503
<i>-of fentanyl.
- I want to know</i>

29:15.545 --> 29:16.880
<i>where all these people live.</i>

29:16.921 --> 29:19.716
<i>You gonna tell me
where this list came from?</i>

29:19.758 --> 29:22.427
<i>If you needed to know,
I'd tell you.</i>

29:23.720 --> 29:25.096
<i>All right?</i>

29:25.722 --> 29:27.265
<i>All right.</i>

29:33.521 --> 29:37.108
<i>When the block was blazin',
I was ice-cold...</i>

29:37.192 --> 29:38.318
<i>Kobe!</i>

- Yeah, we'll see.</i>

33:26.963 --> 33:30.091
<i>Who are you betting on?
Not his roommate!</i>

33:33.136 --> 33:37.473
<i>No, man, no. I got money on Poe.</i>

34:08.629 --> 34:10.840
<i>Okay.</i>

34:12.050 --> 34:13.384
<i>It's high.</i>

34:13.468 --> 34:16.220
<i>I just need something
to help me sleep. I haven't</i>

34:16.304 --> 34:18.097
<i>slept in nearly 60 hours.</i>

34:18.139 --> 34:19.974
<i>And why is that?</i>

34:20.016 --> 34:21.434
<i>Eh, just going
through a rough patch.</i>

34:21.476 --> 34:24.103
<i>I just-- Getting a good night's
sleep would really help.</i>

34:24.145 --> 34:26.564
<i>Your face is cut up.
What've you been up to?</i>

34:26.606 --> 34:28.566
<i>Eh. Part of the job.</i>

34:28.649 --> 34:29.942

<i>Been taking your meds?</i>

34:31.527 --> 34:34.489
<i>Y...
Yeah, I've been taking my meds.</i>

34:34.530 --> 34:36.699
<i>I just need to be able
to get some sleep.</i>

34:36.741 --> 34:38.534
<i>This is really high.</i>

34:38.618 --> 34:39.827
<i>You said that already.</i>

34:39.911 --> 34:42.080
<i>You're under some stress, huh?</i>

34:42.163 --> 34:44.123
<i>Yes, I'm under stress.</i>

34:44.207 --> 34:45.917
<i>A high school kid died
last night.</i>

34:45.958 --> 34:48.169
<i>-That was stressful.
- I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

34:48.211 --> 34:50.505
<i>I want you to monitor
your pressure.</i>

34:50.588 --> 34:53.341
<i>Take it several times a day,
write it down,</i>

34:53.424 --> 34:56.886
<i>let me know how you're doing

34:56.969 --> 34:58.221
<i>I'm gonna hold off</i>

34:58.304 --> 35:01.474
<i>on prescribing anything
until we see what's going on.</i>

35:02.183 --> 35:05.603
<i>Everyone in this fucking county
is on opioids,</i>

35:05.645 --> 35:10.274
<i>and you won't give a cop
something to help him sleep?</i>

35:14.112 --> 35:17.323
<i>Here's some antibacterial
for that cut.</i>

35:18.908 --> 35:21.452
<i>You give me a call in a week.</i>

35:48.980 --> 35:52.316
<i>You know,
you could've taken the day off.</i>

35:54.068 --> 35:56.445
<i>Not with things
the way they are.</i>

35:56.529 --> 36:00.324
<i>Not with you
ready to keel over any minute.</i>

36:21.721 --> 36:24.432
<i>Ah. Welcome to the Brownsville
Home for the young at heart.</i>

36:24.473 --> 36:27.101
<i>Yeah.
We're with the, uh, Buell PD.</i>

36:27.185 --> 36:29.437
<i>We were wondering
if you might be able</i>

36:29.478 --> 36:31.939
<i>to give us a-a hand
with something.</i>

36:32.023 --> 36:33.608
<i>We're looking for a, uh...</i>

36:33.691 --> 36:36.944
<i>Wesley Ives. We'd like
to ask him a few questions.</i>

36:36.986 --> 36:39.822
<i>-Aw, big Wes?
- Sure.</i>

36:39.864 --> 36:41.824
<i>Yeah. Well, he died.</i>

36:41.866 --> 36:44.202
<i>He... Um...</i>

36:44.243 --> 36:46.662
<i>Uh, when-when was that?</i>

36:46.746 --> 36:48.206
<i>About six months ago.</i>

36:48.247 --> 36:50.416
<i>Are you family?
Because we've been calling.</i>

36:50.458 --> 36:52.084
<i>That Buick's
been sitting outside</i>

36:52.126 --> 36:53.502
<i>since he passed.
Can't be good for them pistons.</i>

36:53.586 --> 36:56.505
<i>We're actually
with the police department,</i>

36:56.547 --> 36:58.925
<i>-like he said.
- Oh, okay.</i>

36:59.008 --> 37:00.301
<i>So, you're taking the car?</i>

37:00.384 --> 37:03.054
<i>-No. What--
Uh, how about...</i>

37:03.095 --> 37:05.514
<i>How about, uh, Ella Foyer?
She here?</i>

37:05.598 --> 37:07.808
<i>Sweet Ella.
Yeah, been about eight weeks,</i>

37:07.850 --> 37:09.310
<i>but it does feel like yesterday.</i>

37:09.352 --> 37:11.938
<i>Lenny Aponte, Earl Young,
Candace Adley.</i>

37:12.021 --> 37:13.439
<i>They-they all passed, too?</i>

37:13.481 --> 37:15.191
<i>I-I been here about a year.</i>

37:15.233 --> 37:17.026
<i>They must've died
before I started,</i>

37:17.109 --> 37:18.152
<i>'cause I don't know them.</i>

37:18.194 --> 37:20.071
<i>I got one of them good memories.</i>

37:22.949 --> 37:25.076
<i>Thanks for your time.</i>

37:32.959 --> 37:34.794
<i>Hello.</i>

37:35.336 --> 37:37.213
<i>My name's LeeAnn English.</i>

37:37.296 --> 37:38.881
<i>Okay. Can I help you?</i>

37:38.923 --> 37:40.633
<i>I'm looking for paralegal work.</i>

37:40.716 --> 37:44.095
<i>I have a BA from Yale,
and I've finished a semester</i>

37:44.136 --> 37:45.680
<i>at Columbia Law School.</i>

37:45.721 --> 37:49.809
<i>I'm back at home with my family
for the time being,</i>

37:49.892 --> 37:51.018
<i>and I'd like to be useful.</i>

37:51.060 --> 37:52.353
<i>Uh, the coordinator's
out to lunch.</i>

37:52.395 --> 37:54.355
<i>-You can come back tomorrow.
- I'll wait.</i>

37:54.438 --> 37:56.565
<i>I don't mind.</i>

37:57.108 --> 37:58.150
<i>Okay, then.</i>

37:58.234 --> 38:00.569
<i>There's coffee in there.
Help yourself.</i>

38:00.653 --> 38:01.988
<i>I'm fine.</i>

38:02.071 --> 38:04.490
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:09.203 --> 38:11.038
<i>Thirty-two dead people.</i>

38:11.080 --> 38:13.582
<i>Monthly refill
for every single one.</i>

38:13.666 --> 38:16.419
<i>-Uh, yeah.
- Couple doses a day,</i>

38:16.460 --> 38:18.629
<i>we're talking
maybe 2,000 pills a month.</i>

38:18.713 --> 38:21.966
<i>Let's go handcuff
our neighborhood pharmacist.</i>

38:22.008 --> 38:23.801
<i>No.</i>

38:24.593 --> 38:27.513
<i>-Excuse me?
- If we arrest Jackson,</i>

38:27.555 --> 38:29.098
<i>whoever's on the ground selling,</i>

38:29.140 --> 38:30.599
<i>they'll hear about it,
and they'll disappear.</i>

38:30.641 --> 38:33.728
<i>But he can't continue to have
access to all those drugs.</i>

38:33.811 --> 38:36.188
<i>Jackson's a criminal,
but he's not stupid.</i>

38:36.230 --> 38:37.982
<i>I'll bet he's shut down for now.</i>

38:38.065 --> 38:39.984
<i>He knows
how many people overdosed.</i>

38:40.067 --> 38:41.360
<i>I want Trent's dealer</i>

38:41.402 --> 38:43.237
<i>and whoever sold to him.</i>

38:43.321 --> 38:46.282
<i>And I'll use Jackson to get
to this Bobby Jesus prick.</i>

38:46.365 --> 38:49.035
<i>I want them all.
Every single one.</i>

38:50.286 --> 38:52.413
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>

38:52.496 --> 38:54.707
<i>What do you mean?</i>

39:00.796 --> 39:03.007
<i>What do you mean?</i>

39:04.091 --> 39:06.218
<i>I now understand
why you want to wait.</i>

39:06.260 --> 39:07.428
<i>Do you?</i>

39:07.470 --> 39:09.972
<i>Ask me again how I got the list.</i>

39:10.014 --> 39:11.182
<i>You want to wait so you can find</i>

39:11.265 --> 39:12.433
<i>this Bobby guy
for your girlfriend.</i>

39:12.475 --> 39:14.643
<i>-You tag him with drug dealing</i>

39:14.685 --> 39:16.145
<i>and killing a high school kid,
he becomes</i>

39:16.187 --> 39:17.730
<i>a pretty terrible witness
against Billy Poe.</i>

39:17.813 --> 39:18.773
<i>Explain to me</i>

39:18.814 --> 39:21.275
<i>what's wrong with getting him
for dealing and homicide.</i>

39:21.317 --> 39:23.736
<i>It depends why you're doing it.</i>

39:23.819 --> 39:25.237
<i>You can have
two different reasons</i>

39:25.279 --> 39:26.530
<i>-for doing the right thing.
- No.</i>

39:26.572 --> 39:28.199
<i>One of them's always
the most important.</i>

39:28.282 --> 39:29.950
<i>If it's the wrong reason,</i>

39:30.034 --> 39:31.452
<i>-it corrupts everything.
- Okay.</i>

39:31.494 --> 39:33.204
<i>Thanks for the philosophy class.</i>

39:33.245 --> 39:36.040
<i>Turn on the fucking car.</i>

39:41.212 --> 39:43.714
<i>Where to, boss?</i>

39:59.522 --> 40:03.317
<i>Hey there.
I was actually gonna call you.</i>

40:03.359 --> 40:06.695
<i>Someone cut my power last night.</i>

40:06.779 --> 40:09.949
<i>I-I think they broke in
through my back door.</i>

40:10.032 --> 40:11.992
<i>Thank God we're here.</i>

40:12.076 --> 40:13.619
<i>What'd they take?</i>

40:13.661 --> 40:14.787
<i>That's the weird thing.</i>

40:14.870 --> 40:17.081
<i>I don't think
they took anything.</i>

40:17.123 --> 40:18.165
<i>Huh.</i>

40:18.207 --> 40:21.419
<i>Do I, uh,
need to, like, call it in?</i>

40:21.460 --> 40:22.670
<i>Make an official report?</i>

40:22.753 --> 40:24.547
<i>'Cause I don't mind
just telling you guys</i>

40:24.630 --> 40:26.590
<i>and having you watch out.
Save you some paperwork.</i>

40:26.632 --> 40:30.386
<i>Sure. We can run
some more patrols down this way.</i>

40:30.469 --> 40:33.347
<i>If I were you, I might put
a camera out back there.</i>

40:33.389 --> 40:37.560
<i>Then you can keep an eye
on everyone who comes and goes.</i>

40:37.601 --> 40:40.312
<i>Yeah, all right.
I might do that.</i>

40:40.354 --> 40:41.605
<i>Thanks.</i>

40:41.647 --> 40:43.357
<i>Sorry, um...</i>

40:43.441 --> 40:47.069
<i>Can I help you guys
with anything?</i>

40:47.570 --> 40:50.156
<i>Right. We're out of Narcan.</i>

40:50.197 --> 40:53.117
<i>Uh, got you. Spray or injection?</i>

40:53.200 --> 40:54.201
<i>Both.</i>

40:56.203 --> 40:58.956
<i>Are you... are you...
are you kidding?</i>

40:58.998 --> 41:03.502
<i>You're gonna have our-our town
pay for an overdose he caused?</i>

41:03.586 --> 41:05.004
<i>I heard about what happened</i>

41:05.087 --> 41:09.592
<i>with that football player.
That's-that's just terrible.</i>

41:10.342 --> 41:13.262
<i>-Put it on the PD account.
- Yeah.</i>

41:13.304 --> 41:16.974
<i>You know, it's... such a shame.</i>

41:17.016 --> 41:18.434
<i>Their only son.</i>

41:18.517 --> 41:21.979
<i>That's-that's...
That is a tragedy.</i>

41:22.813 --> 41:27.318
<i>When I see his parents,
I'll give them your condolences.</i>

44:06.518 --> 44:08.896
<i>-You're new.
- Hopefully.</i>

44:08.979 --> 44:10.773
<i>I'm waiting to be interviewed.</i>

44:10.856 --> 44:13.817
<i>Rachel. Good luck.</i>

44:25.621 --> 44:26.664
<i>Who are you?</i>

44:26.705 --> 44:28.332
<i>Lee.</i>

44:28.374 --> 44:30.876
<i>No. I recognize you.</i>

44:30.918 --> 44:32.378
<i>You were
at Billy Poe's arraignment.</i>

44:32.419 --> 44:34.755
<i>You were crying.
What are you doing here?</i>

44:34.838 --> 44:37.508
<i>I'm taking
a few months off law school</i>

44:37.591 --> 44:38.884
<i>to be with my family,</i>

44:38.926 --> 44:40.803
<i>and I wanted to find a place
where I could help.</i>

44:40.844 --> 44:42.554
<i>There are lots of places
where you can help.</i>

44:42.596 --> 44:44.181
<i>Legal Aid. Pittsburgh ACLU.</i>

44:44.264 --> 44:45.808
<i>I was impressed
by your work in the courtroom.</i>

44:45.849 --> 44:48.018
<i>You came here
expecting to work with me?</i>

44:48.060 --> 44:50.270
<i>-I was hoping to.
- On this case?</i>

44:50.312 --> 44:51.563
<i>If you need it.</i>

44:51.605 --> 44:52.815
<i>I don't need it.</i>

44:52.856 --> 44:54.817
<i>I don't need your help, period.</i>

44:54.900 --> 44:56.694
<i>You stay away from me,
we'll be all right.</i>

44:56.735 --> 44:58.987
<i>I think you do need it.</i>

44:59.446 --> 45:03.617
<i>Billy's probably
stonewalling you, right?</i>

45:03.659 --> 45:06.078
<i>He's gonna keep doing that.</i>

45:06.161 --> 45:08.205
<i>If he ever does see you,
it'll be too late</i>

45:08.247 --> 45:09.873
<i>for you to help him.</i>

45:10.666 --> 45:13.043
<i>I can get you in to talk to him.</i>

45:13.627 --> 45:15.796
<i>How do you know that?</i>

45:15.879 --> 45:18.882
<i>Because he's in love with me.</i>

45:48.746 --> 45:51.665
Some people wondering
where you were today.

45:51.707 --> 45:55.252
<i>Yeah. Not feeling so great.</i>

46:03.343 --> 46:05.304
<i>-It's high.</i>

46:05.345 --> 46:07.264
<i>Huh.</i>

46:09.266 --> 46:14.605
<i>Well, maybe that's just 'cause
you're sitting so close to me.</i>

46:18.108 --> 46:19.985
<i>Look, I know how tired you are.</i>

46:20.068 --> 46:21.653
<i>Why don't you
just stay here tonight.</i>

46:21.695 --> 46:23.697
<i>That way I can just take it
again in a couple hours.</i>

46:23.739 --> 46:26.700
<i>No, you...
You don't have to do that.</i>

46:26.742 --> 46:28.786
<i>You don't have to do
any of this.</i>

46:28.827 --> 46:30.788
<i>Yes, I know I don't.</i>

46:30.871 --> 46:33.290
<i>I want to.</i>

46:34.082 --> 46:37.920
<i>Everything's happening
at the same time.</i>

46:38.504 --> 46:41.632
<i>That poor kid died last night.</i>

46:42.466 --> 46:43.801
<i>I think I might be close</i>

46:43.884 --> 46:46.804
<i>to finding the guy
who named Billy.</i>

46:46.887 --> 46:48.555
<i>He could be connected</i>

46:48.639 --> 46:52.643
<i>to all the drugs
around the community.</i>

46:53.519 --> 46:56.313
<i>Trying to be a good cop.</i>

46:59.650 --> 47:03.320
<i>The guy who named Billy
is a drug dealer?</i>

47:04.404 --> 47:06.323
<i>I think so.</i>

47:06.824 --> 47:09.368
<i>Hard drugs?</i>

47:09.409 --> 47:10.994
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

47:11.036 --> 47:13.288
<i>quiet, dramatic music</i>

47:16.500 --> 47:19.002
<i>Can you prove it?</i>

47:20.546 --> 47:23.340
<i>Not yet.</i>

47:24.508 --> 47:27.344
<i>But I'm trying.</i>

47:31.515 --> 47:34.017
<i>I know you are.</i>

47:35.143 --> 47:37.062
<i>Don't worry.
You'll figure it out.</i>

47:37.104 --> 47:39.690
<i>We're in this together.</i>

47:42.818 --> 47:45.696
<i>Just let me take care of you.</i>

47:49.032 --> 47:52.703
<i>You do your work,
and I'll watch out for you.</i>

48:09.636 --> 48:11.513
<i>ominous, dramatic music</i>

48:31.033 --> 48:31.992
<i>Get in there!</i>

48:32.075 --> 48:34.703
<i>Bring him in!</i>

49:06.234 --> 49:09.237
<i>Get up!
Get up, motherfucker!</i>

49:09.821 --> 49:11.782
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

49:18.664 --> 49:20.123
<i>Come on!</i>

49:27.089 --> 49:29.091
<i>Fucking go!</i>

49:31.259 --> 49:34.930
<i>That's right, baby.
Hands up. Hands up!</i>

49:35.013 --> 49:35.847
<i>Let's go!</i>

49:35.931 --> 49:38.058
<i>Beat the shit out of him!</i>

49:38.141 --> 49:40.519
<i>Beat the shit
out of him!</i>

49:48.777 --> 49:51.196
<i>Come on. Get up.</i>

49:51.863 --> 49:53.865
<i>Come on!</i>

49:53.907 --> 49:57.035
<i>-Get up!</i>

49:57.119 --> 49:59.121
<i>intense, dramatic music</i>

50:00.080 --> 50:03.208
<i></i>

50:21.018 --> 50:22.310
<i>Get him, man!</i>

50:22.352 --> 50:24.521
<i>-Get him, man!
- Kill him!</i>

50:24.604 --> 50:26.648
<i>Kill him!
Fuck him up!</i>

50:26.690 --> 50:28.692
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

50:30.777 --> 50:31.945
<i>Yeah!</i>

50:32.029 --> 50:34.281
<i>-Kill him!
- Do it!</i>

50:34.322 --> 50:37.117
<i>All right!
All right, that's it!</i>

50:37.159 --> 50:40.370
<i>Get him up. Come on. Get up.</i>

50:44.166 --> 50:46.877
<i>Told you! Told you!</i>

50:48.086 --> 50:50.672
<i>-Get him out of here.</i>

50:53.341 --> 50:56.511
Go to your bunks.
It's past your bedtime.

50:57.137 --> 50:59.598
<i>Jesus.</i>

51:16.990 --> 51:20.702
<i>quiet, dramatic music</i>

51:38.261 --> 51:40.597
<i>You did good.</i>

52:09.751 --> 52:11.962
<i>Sleep well.</i>
