WEBVTT

00:05.104 --> 00:05.996
This is humiliating.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.114
Oh, no, we passed humiliating two minutes ago.

00:08.540 --> 00:11.151
Luke's gonna be completely out of doughnuts by the time we get there.

00:11.237 --> 00:13.685
I don't why he won't just buy six extra sprinkled ones,

00:13.767 --> 00:15.513
so we'd never have to have the conversation

00:15.548 --> 00:17.152
which we're going to have- if we ever get there.

00:17.233 --> 00:19.107
I got school in two hours. I'm never gonna make it.

00:19.384 --> 00:20.208
Kirk, how you doing?

00:21.294 --> 00:21.944
You sure?

00:22.850 --> 00:25.277
You seem to be having a little trouble forming words there.

00:25.415 --> 00:27.756
No... fine... me.

00:28.636 --> 00:30.454
You know, you don't have to take us all the way to Luke's.

00:30.736 --> 00:32.552
Yes, Kirk, listen to her.

00:32.779 --> 00:37.094
I offered you the first ride in Kirk's new Stars Hollow Pedi-cab,

00:37.167 --> 00:38.626
and that is exactly what you're gonna get.

00:40.149 --> 00:43.408
Time just whizzes by when you're riding in a pedi-cab.

00:46.863 --> 00:49.567
- Gypsy just out-strolled us. 
- We've gotta get outta here.

00:49.777 --> 00:52.009
- How we doing back there? 
- We're doing fine, Kirk.

00:52.506 --> 00:54.778
I figure this baby's gonna be a real money...

00:55.563 --> 00:57.283
A real money- moneywhat, Kirk?

00:58.183 --> 00:59.105
Kirk, can you breathe?

00:59.515 --> 01:00.284
Talk to us.

01:00.544 --> 01:03.084
Hit the handlebars three times if you can breathe and two if you can't.

01:04.539 --> 01:06.135
- He hit once. 
- What does once mean?

01:06.345 --> 01:07.559
That he couldn't make it to twice?

01:07.697 --> 01:09.202
Kirk. Kirk, stop, please.

01:10.299 --> 01:11.127
Just for a second.

01:11.424 --> 01:13.611
Then we'll be on our way... like the wind.

01:14.727 --> 01:16.366
Okay, you know what, Kirk?

01:16.530 --> 01:17.834
This has been really fun,

01:18.076 --> 01:20.892
but I think we'll just hoof it the rest of the way.

01:21.071 --> 01:23.369
- But the ride wasn't over yet. 
- Yeah, but we don't want to hog the cab.

01:23.463 --> 01:25.167
- 'Cause there's only one. 
- But we'll tell our friends.

01:25.264 --> 01:26.657
- What was wrong with the ride? 
- Nothing.

01:26.718 --> 01:29.185
I mean, it's great for tourists who are new to the town

01:29.262 --> 01:30.778
and want to make sure they don't miss a thing.

01:30.917 --> 01:32.079
I wasn't going that slow.

01:32.212 --> 01:35.034
No, you just maybe need a little more training before tourist season kicks in.

01:35.099 --> 01:37.275
You know, take a spinning class or buy some legs.

01:37.547 --> 01:39.533
- Sorry, Kirk. 
- You will be sorry.

01:40.025 --> 01:44.351
You'll be sorry you turned down the chance to ride in Stars Hollow's first...

01:44.434 --> 01:45.918
Now he's gonna hate us forever.

01:45.995 --> 01:48.166
No, he's not. He's just gonna hate us till something shiny comes by.

01:49.489 --> 01:52.575
Well, well, well. I guess it wasn't me that was slowing things down.

01:52.722 --> 01:54.300
I guess it was my big, fat cargo.

01:54.718 --> 01:56.753
- Freshman 15! 
- Kirk!

01:56.983 --> 01:58.682
Can't wait to get my doughnut!

01:58.831 --> 02:00.863
Stay away from my doughnut, Kirk! I mean it!

02:01.098 --> 02:02.943
It's my doughnut! Freak!

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074

02:58.208 --> 02:59.677
You might as well stick your head in a sugar bowl.

02:59.821 --> 03:00.967
If you can find one big enough.

03:01.362 --> 03:02.744
You won't be able to eat like that forever, you know.

03:03.001 --> 03:03.794
What are you getting?

03:03.968 --> 03:05.790
All bran. Asher turned me on to it.

03:05.976 --> 03:06.973
He's a romantic.

03:07.259 --> 03:09.902
He wants me to live a long time and be healthy. That is romantic.

03:10.061 --> 03:12.908
Okay. Just a joke. No reflection on your man-friend.

03:13.231 --> 03:15.466
So after breakfast, I'm going to pick up the sign for our table,

03:15.667 --> 03:17.019
and then I'll meet you in the courtyard.

03:17.711 --> 03:18.555
Antioxidants.

03:19.174 --> 03:20.116
Yeah, I'll meet you in the courtyard.

03:20.670 --> 03:22.313
I'm actually really excited about this.

03:22.676 --> 03:25.422
I mean, it's our first social protest of significance in college.

03:25.545 --> 03:26.661
I know, it's so exciting.

03:26.761 --> 03:28.681
We actually get to do something important,

03:28.764 --> 03:30.424
make a difference, have a say in the world.

03:30.612 --> 03:33.782
Wouldn't it be amazing if we could just get one Burmese political prisoner released

03:33.829 --> 03:35.687
- because of our petition? 
- You're thinking small, Geller.

03:35.759 --> 03:37.385
- Let's get 'em all out. 
- Even the guilty ones.

03:37.488 --> 03:38.411
- Hell, yeah. 
- Seriously?

03:38.493 --> 03:39.711
'Cause that'd be great, really great.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.429
Okay, so I'll pick you up at 7:00, Saturday morning.

03:42.532 --> 03:44.365
- Okay, Glenn. 
- Thank you, seriously.

03:44.673 --> 03:45.692
No problem, Glenn.

03:46.213 --> 03:47.365
This is a turning point.

03:47.749 --> 03:48.814
You know how you have them,

03:48.865 --> 03:51.558
when even the angry voices in your head have to shut up for just a minute?

03:51.657 --> 03:52.229
Sure.

03:53.642 --> 03:54.441
Why is he so happy?

03:54.599 --> 03:56.510
Oh, I couldn't get away earlier for spring break.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.461
My friends are leaving without me. I need a ride,

03:58.558 --> 03:59.905
Glenn has a van, and there you go.

04:00.074 --> 04:01.830
You're going to ride to Florida with a guy who's bummed

04:01.897 --> 04:03.586
that he got turned down by that German cannibal?

04:03.699 --> 04:05.978
That was just a rumor and, yes, I'm desperate.

04:06.069 --> 04:07.641
Glenn's not that bad. I'm sure you'll be fine.

04:07.784 --> 04:09.848
Hey, there's extra room in the van, in case you guys need a ride.

04:09.955 --> 04:13.247
Oh, no, thank you. I don't think we're gonna do the whole spring break thing.

04:13.349 --> 04:16.356
Ever since I broke up with Moondoggie, soakin' up the rays hasn't been the same.

04:16.427 --> 04:18.168
It's going to be really fun. You're missing out.

04:18.285 --> 04:20.947
I'm not really a spring break kind of gal, but thank you for the offer.

04:21.071 --> 04:22.453
Okay, but if you change your mind...

04:22.545 --> 04:23.927
Gary Gilmore's got room in the car -- got it.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.897
Oh, Janet, if you have a chance, you should stop by

04:26.960 --> 04:29.150
and sign our petition for political prisoners in Burma.

04:29.253 --> 04:31.889
I'll try. Actually, I have to run out and get a new bathing suit

04:31.946 --> 04:33.640
- before my class this afternoon. 
- Okay.

04:33.779 --> 04:37.235
Think of all the tortured souls festering in Burma while you're at the size-2 rack.

04:37.803 --> 04:39.283
I hate that she's thin.

04:49.667 --> 04:50.879
- Hey, Luke. 
- I saw you come in.

04:50.929 --> 04:52.943
- I was gonna get to you, okay? 
- Sorry?

04:53.035 --> 04:54.822
If you don't like the service, you can go somewhere else.

04:54.975 --> 04:57.628
- Who could not like the service? 
- I'm busy. You ready to order?

04:57.915 --> 04:59.917
Coffee for now. Is everything okay?

05:00.029 --> 05:00.976
You're not gonna eat?

05:01.186 --> 05:03.332
No, I just came in for coffee and to show you something.

05:03.633 --> 05:06.164
We got the sample stationery and postcards for the inn.

05:06.368 --> 05:06.926
What?

05:07.059 --> 05:09.742
You know, the stationery and the postcards that you leave in the guests' room

05:09.882 --> 05:11.986
so that they can write a letter home saying,

05:12.088 --> 05:14.167
"Having a great time- wish you were here." Which, of course, they don't,

05:14.244 --> 05:16.328
because you were the thing they were trying to get away from in this first place.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.739
- Nobody uses that stuff. 
- Oh, sure they do.

05:18.845 --> 05:22.830
I have never once stayed in a hotel and used the stationery or written a postcard.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.569
- Are you gonna order? 
- I did order, and what is with you?

05:25.660 --> 05:28.540
Nothin'. I'm fine. The paper's fine. The postcards are fine.

05:28.600 --> 05:30.412
I don't know why you're showing them to me anyhow.

05:30.505 --> 05:31.763
Because you are an investor in the inn.

05:31.835 --> 05:33.218
I want to keep you apprised of the goings-on.

05:33.357 --> 05:35.590
I am not an investor. I loaned you money.

05:35.753 --> 05:37.361
That is what investors do.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.515
- An investor goes to meetings. 
- We're having a meeting.

05:39.634 --> 05:41.435
They're involved in the business decisions.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.211
Hello... stationary. Decide -- yes, no.

05:45.142 --> 05:46.198
I'll get your coffee.

05:49.684 --> 05:51.457
- Do you want to talk about it? 
- What?

05:51.552 --> 05:53.800
Whatever it is that's put you in this charming mood.

06:00.007 --> 06:01.696
I am not wearing my socks.

06:02.427 --> 06:02.991
What?

06:03.636 --> 06:05.286
I am not wearing my socks.

06:05.486 --> 06:07.383
So, what are those, someone else's?

06:07.486 --> 06:08.547
- Yes. 
- What?

06:08.813 --> 06:11.024
I am wearing someone else's socks.

06:11.410 --> 06:14.424
- I'm sorry, I need more. 
- I spent the night at Nicole's place.

06:14.706 --> 06:16.008
Also known as "your place".

06:16.130 --> 06:17.645
Got up a little late, grabbed a pair of socks,

06:17.733 --> 06:19.452
and it wasn't until I was halfway to work that I realized

06:19.508 --> 06:21.753
they were someone else's socks.

06:21.956 --> 06:23.431
And you're sure about this?

06:23.609 --> 06:26.795
Hey, if there's one thing in this life I am sure about, it's my socks.

06:26.882 --> 06:30.149
I buy the same brand in bulk, and I've been doing this for as long as I can remember.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.002
My socks are all white with a red stripe.

06:32.140 --> 06:36.072
These are white with a gold stripe and some sort of fruity padding in the toe.

06:36.205 --> 06:39.010
- Maybe they're Jess' socks. 
- They are not Jess' socks.

06:39.154 --> 06:40.936
Well, maybe when you went to the laundromat,

06:40.987 --> 06:43.870
someone accidentally left a pair of socks in the dryer, and then your --

06:43.936 --> 06:47.101
- I don't go to a laundromat. 
- Maybe they're Nicole's socks.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.796
You know, her gym socks or...

06:50.286 --> 06:51.596
you're not wearing your socks.

06:52.333 --> 06:53.925
I am not wearing my socks.

06:55.072 --> 06:57.320
Show your support for the Burmese prisoners.

06:57.548 --> 06:59.420
Sign up now- take a stand.

07:00.045 --> 07:03.112
This bowl of rice is all a Burmese prisoner gets to eat in a day.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.384
One bowl- that's it.

07:05.779 --> 07:07.566
No butter or soy sauce...

07:07.781 --> 07:10.127
Enjoy your "Maxim." You couldn't read that in Burma!

07:10.238 --> 07:11.457
- I'm freezing. 
- Me too.

07:12.517 --> 07:14.257
Look at all these hypocrites passing by.

07:14.421 --> 07:16.684
Everyone claims to be so politically aware,

07:16.765 --> 07:20.197
but not one person can stop by for two seconds to sign a stupid petition.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.052
People suck.

07:21.411 --> 07:23.534
- You all suck! 
- Paris, the rice!

07:23.904 --> 07:26.059
Great, we have one prop, and it's blowing away.

07:26.167 --> 07:27.974
- You knocked it over. 
- You put it right in front of me.

07:28.103 --> 07:30.478
How was I supposed to know you were gonna jump out of your seat like a maniac?

07:30.559 --> 07:32.331
You know me. You room with me. You should have known.

07:32.562 --> 07:33.728
Hey, Rory, Paris.

07:33.929 --> 07:36.034
Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad you stopped by

07:36.146 --> 07:39.883
because this is an issue that affects every person that has a heart and a soul.

07:40.032 --> 07:42.428
A great injustice is being perpetrated on our watch,

07:42.499 --> 07:43.903
and we've got to do something to stop it.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.285
Aren't you gonna sign the petition?

07:45.414 --> 07:47.257
No, I just needed a place to put my sandwich down.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.308
Is that a raindrop?

07:50.913 --> 07:51.470
Yep.

07:52.233 --> 07:54.060
- Out of the way. 
- Move, move, move!

07:54.229 --> 07:56.002
- Is it raining? 
- No, it's National Baptism Day.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.282
Tie your tubes, idiot.

07:58.531 --> 07:59.534
- Wet. 
- Cold.

08:01.456 --> 08:04.592
Go, go! I get the radiator.

08:04.700 --> 08:05.985
- No way. 
- You got it last night.

08:06.084 --> 08:06.693
I did not!

08:06.799 --> 08:08.602
Paris, you took up the whole thing with your "Hey, Gore,

08:08.669 --> 08:11.520
do not endorse me" sweatshirt, and my blue sweater is still soaked.

08:11.587 --> 08:13.594
- Fine! Take half. 
- Oh, my god, I'm cold!

08:13.754 --> 08:15.027
- Can't stop shaking. 
- We're wimps...

08:15.093 --> 08:18.084
- we would last two seconds in Burma. 
- At least it's warm in Burma.

08:18.182 --> 08:20.567
Yeah. Okay, we're horrible.

08:20.777 --> 08:23.101
This is the kind of cold you read about in a Dickens novel.

08:23.163 --> 08:25.201
We should be in a workhouse or shilling for Fagin.

08:25.432 --> 08:27.797
It's supposed to be spring. Why is it still cold?

08:27.924 --> 08:29.723
It's been the coldest winter in the history of winter.

08:30.890 --> 08:33.996
My brain- I think it's frozen. Is that possible?

08:34.222 --> 08:36.506
And these gray skies- it's a blanket of misery.

08:36.607 --> 08:39.190
All I can think about is getting warm. That's all I can think about.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.810
It's warm in Florida.

08:47.504 --> 08:48.712
- What? 
- Nothing.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.478
- Did you say "Florida"? 
- No.

08:51.708 --> 08:53.059
- Yes. 
- Seriously?

08:53.391 --> 08:55.179
- Maybe. 
- But it's spring break.

08:55.420 --> 08:56.022
I know.

08:56.259 --> 08:58.167
It's "girls gone wild," and boys doing the twist.

08:58.282 --> 09:00.017
We're not spring-breaky people, are we?

09:00.093 --> 09:02.086
I don't know what we are, but I am so cold right now

09:02.147 --> 09:04.774
that the thought of spending a week with a bunch of drunken bimbos

09:04.852 --> 09:08.213
and rattle-headed frat boys seems like a very good trade off for being warm.

09:09.253 --> 09:09.904
Warm...

09:11.742 --> 09:12.495
Warm...

09:15.225 --> 09:19.048
- Mom, where's my bathing suit? 
- Do you have a bathing suit?

09:19.197 --> 09:21.589
- Of course I have a bathing suit. 
- When was the last time you wore it?

09:21.971 --> 09:22.751
I don't remember.

09:23.676 --> 09:26.330
- Did it involve a rubber ducky? 
- No... I don't think.

09:26.545 --> 09:28.542
Check the bottom drawer, and I will look in your closet.

09:29.442 --> 09:31.802
So now, tell me again- who's driving?

09:32.094 --> 09:33.390
Glenn. It's his mom's van.

09:33.605 --> 09:35.126
And this Glenn- he's a good driver?

09:35.924 --> 09:38.346
- I have no idea. 
- Kid, you've got to learn to lie.

09:38.607 --> 09:40.655
Glenn's a very responsible guy. I'm sure it will be fine.

09:40.850 --> 09:42.273
And the place you're staying is safe?

09:42.767 --> 09:45.560
Now you're catching on. Aha! Bathing suit.

09:45.811 --> 09:47.777
Now we just have to find the wimple that goes with it.

09:47.910 --> 09:48.776
Give me that, please.

09:49.538 --> 09:51.268
Hey, was I supposed to clear this with you first?

09:51.377 --> 09:52.693
- Clear what with me? 
- Going away.

09:52.881 --> 09:53.946
Oh, I don't know.

09:54.099 --> 09:56.456
I mean, I don't live here anymore, so I'm not sure what the protocol is.

09:56.588 --> 09:58.744
Ah, well. I think as long as I know now,

09:58.826 --> 10:01.520
and I feel as if I have veto power, we're good.

10:01.637 --> 10:02.452
You have veto power?

10:02.563 --> 10:05.051
No. I feel as if I have veto power- very different statement.

10:05.334 --> 10:05.886
Got it.

10:06.143 --> 10:07.894
But you'll call me a lot while you're there, right?

10:08.072 --> 10:09.082
You're not worried, are you?

10:09.174 --> 10:11.668
Because I'm just going for the sun and to read, nothing more.

10:11.810 --> 10:15.143
I know, I know. It's just it's always the good kids who've never had a drink

10:15.267 --> 10:17.950
that take one sip of Kahlua and fall out of a window.

10:18.061 --> 10:19.638
So you're sad you never taught me how to drink?

10:19.756 --> 10:20.582
Exactly!

10:20.700 --> 10:22.456
Well grab a bottle and some quarters and let's go.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.047
- No falling out of windows. 
- Not even a first floor one.

10:25.172 --> 10:27.478
And don't drink. And after you're done not drinking,

10:27.549 --> 10:29.644
drink tons of water and take two aspirin before you go to bed.

10:29.735 --> 10:30.339
Got it.

10:30.513 --> 10:33.289
And take Paris with you everywhere. Not much can happen with that girl along.

10:33.454 --> 10:33.991
Got it.

10:34.938 --> 10:35.593
They're here.

10:36.860 --> 10:39.279
Maybe they can stop by a bathing suit store along the way.

10:39.555 --> 10:40.442
My suit is fine.

10:40.759 --> 10:41.989
No, sure it is.

10:42.342 --> 10:45.087
It's nice to be able to go from the beach to the mosque

10:45.209 --> 10:46.171
without having to change.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.240
Seriously, Paris, get out!

10:51.369 --> 10:52.745
No! I have to drive.

10:52.858 --> 10:54.511
You drive exactly like you look like you drive.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.392
What's that supposed to mean?

10:55.505 --> 10:58.106
You speed like a maniac. You zip in and out of s. You tailgate.

10:58.187 --> 11:00.595
- They were going two miles an hour. 
- It was a driving-school car.

11:00.749 --> 11:03.348
Well, they went to school to learn a lesson. I was just giving them their money's worth.

11:04.797 --> 11:05.418
Hey, guys.

11:05.576 --> 11:07.348
Let's go. We're on a schedule. Get away from Glenn.

11:07.463 --> 11:09.790
- Thank god you're here. 
- Glenn, this is my mom.

11:10.077 --> 11:13.415
Hi, I'm Lorelai. Hey, congratulations on being student of the month

11:13.471 --> 11:14.572
at Grandville Middle School.

11:14.711 --> 11:15.171
Thanks.

11:15.786 --> 11:17.875
- You lookin' forward to the beach? 
- Yes, I am.

11:18.064 --> 11:20.388
You know, you don't have to show up in what you're going to wear.

11:20.465 --> 11:21.534
They'll let you change when you get there.

11:21.632 --> 11:22.338
I'm not cold.

11:22.589 --> 11:23.533
No, of course not.

11:23.915 --> 11:24.910
Could you? Thanks.

11:26.051 --> 11:28.554
- So, how come Paris is driving? 
- Are we gonna go through this again?

11:28.642 --> 11:30.040
I didn't know we'd already gone through it.

11:30.111 --> 11:32.026
I can't be in a car if anybody else is driving, okay?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.314
If I die in a car crash, it's going to be at my own hand.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.585
- Hi, Paris. 
- Hi, Lorelai.

11:35.675 --> 11:36.865
- No windows. 
- No windows.

11:37.115 --> 11:41.627
Oh, hey, Glenn, would you mind if Rory sits up front? She gets carsick.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.060
Oh. Okay.

11:43.690 --> 11:44.294
Airbags.

11:45.830 --> 11:49.726
- Okay, have fun. Drive safely. 
- Let's go... and say a prayer for the road kill.

12:06.566 --> 12:07.754
You're a lunatic!

12:08.173 --> 12:10.831
Hey, I shaved three hours off the MapQuest estimate.

12:10.908 --> 12:12.719
How about a "thank you" for that? Who's in charge here?

12:12.828 --> 12:14.415
I'm guessing pink shirts and white shorts?

12:14.544 --> 12:16.295
I think my clothing choice has been vindicated.

12:16.391 --> 12:19.144
Swank attire and desperation for approval. The chicks are gonna eat you up.

12:19.410 --> 12:21.537
It is warm. Are you feeling the warmth?

12:21.655 --> 12:22.981
I'm definitely starting to thaw.

12:23.359 --> 12:25.013
- Name, please. 
- It's under "Billings."

12:26.922 --> 12:28.706
We have you girls in room 6.

12:28.812 --> 12:30.621
Room 6, okay. And what is your name?

12:30.727 --> 12:31.194
Jack.

12:31.352 --> 12:34.378
Jack. Well, Jack, hello. I'm Paris, and this is Andrew.

12:34.552 --> 12:36.663
And we just want to make sure that we're getting your very best room.

12:36.825 --> 12:40.578
Actually, room 9 has a better view, and it's closer to the ice machine.

12:40.665 --> 12:43.261
Let's go with 9. Now, who's gonna help with our bags?

12:44.182 --> 12:46.574
Good. Okay, those four bags... Rory, your book bag?

12:46.815 --> 12:47.455
Sure.

12:48.944 --> 12:50.625
- I'm gonna go for a run. 
- Now?

12:50.802 --> 12:52.145
Just a short one around the block.

12:52.483 --> 12:54.162
She looks so normal, and then that happens.

12:54.310 --> 12:54.756
Come on.

12:55.662 --> 12:57.479
Paris Geller, room 9. Remember that.

12:58.376 --> 13:00.910
See, a lot of people make the mistake of tipping at the end of a trip.

13:01.129 --> 13:02.584
But I always tip as you go along.

13:02.790 --> 13:04.801
That way, they never know when the honey pot dries up,

13:04.934 --> 13:07.299
and it keeps them from going through your stuff and robbing you blind.

13:09.226 --> 13:11.150
Paris Geller, room 9. Remember that.

13:12.420 --> 13:15.829
Oh, man, look at that. We're right on the ocean.

13:15.947 --> 13:17.642
Paris, look at it. It's right there.

13:17.765 --> 13:18.364
I see it.

13:19.287 --> 13:21.433
Oh, hey, we're in room 9.

13:21.528 --> 13:23.397
Feel free to keep the sheets clean and the towels coming.

13:25.066 --> 13:26.837
Okay... not bad.

13:27.134 --> 13:28.537
Hey, you know what would be swell?

13:28.661 --> 13:30.520
A VCR to go with that television set. You mind?

13:30.683 --> 13:33.279
You're aces, pal...really. I'm giving the toast at your wedding.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.875
Well, at least it doesn't smell bad in here.

13:36.141 --> 13:37.420
Pull your covers down and roll on the bed.

13:37.661 --> 13:38.044
Why?

13:38.204 --> 13:39.792
We are sharing this room with four other girls, Rory.

13:39.882 --> 13:41.978
Plus 10K Barbie- we have to stake out our territory.

13:42.136 --> 13:44.015
Yes, and then we need to up your dosage.

13:44.211 --> 13:48.316
Look, a person comes in, they see a dent in the bed, possibly a hair on the pillow...

13:48.449 --> 13:49.975
So the person's David Caruso?

13:50.062 --> 13:52.837
They'll figure that bed is taken. They will then move on to the couch or the rollaway.

13:53.068 --> 13:55.223
- That's insane. 
- Okay, suit yourself.

14:01.566 --> 14:03.912
And I was worried I would I feel stupid.

14:04.071 --> 14:05.520
Stupid but well rested.

14:05.807 --> 14:07.112
How long do we have to do this?

14:07.527 --> 14:08.592
I think we're good.

14:10.690 --> 14:13.292
- I'm really comfortable right now. 
- Yeah, me, too.

14:15.232 --> 14:16.548
Sounds like more are arriving.

14:17.654 --> 14:19.508
- Where are you going? 
- To see what all the ruckus is about.

14:19.687 --> 14:20.876
Wait for me- I like ruckus.

14:23.537 --> 14:25.571
Man, that's a lot of people stuck in that tiny car.

14:25.724 --> 14:27.101
They should all be wearing Shriner hats.

14:32.370 --> 14:33.829
Hmm, that was subtle.

14:34.222 --> 14:34.996
What are you talking about?

14:35.344 --> 14:37.074
The Joanie loves Chachi moment.

14:37.345 --> 14:38.688
- He said "hey." 
- I heard.

14:38.784 --> 14:39.937
- I said "hey" back. 
- You did.

14:40.039 --> 14:40.806
I was being polite.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.397
In Burma, you'd be married... or brutally killed.

14:43.521 --> 14:44.575
I'm gonna go make your bed.

14:45.015 --> 14:47.084
Don't you dare. Man, I'm thirsty.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.056
Root beer?

14:51.554 --> 14:52.737
Paris, that guy doesn't work here.

14:52.896 --> 14:55.579
Not yet. But look at that mug of his, it's only a matter of time.

15:00.136 --> 15:02.035
- I overslept again. 
- I know.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.836
- Why didn't you get me up? 
- I tried, and you bit me.

15:04.927 --> 15:05.573
I did not bite you.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.452
I did bite you -- cool!

15:08.349 --> 15:10.006
Here, eat this before it gets cold.

15:10.129 --> 15:11.696
You made French toast?

15:11.819 --> 15:14.041
Well, I had a lot of energy after my run, so...

15:14.220 --> 15:15.025
You went running?

15:15.147 --> 15:17.498
Well, I had to wait for the laundry to dry. And I had already read the papers.

15:17.579 --> 15:18.951
You had an entire day before I woke up.

15:19.059 --> 15:19.848
Here, you want bacon?

15:20.042 --> 15:22.689
You went out and slaughtered a pig between the running and the French toast?

15:22.766 --> 15:26.268
Yes, and by the way, that whole ozone-layer problem... taken care of.

15:26.417 --> 15:27.456
You're my Green Party hero.

15:28.378 --> 15:29.627
- Here. 
- Oh, no - can't.

15:29.821 --> 15:31.951
I have to get to the printers and pick up the brochures

15:32.043 --> 15:34.281
because today is mailing day. But do you have a baggie?

15:34.459 --> 15:36.799
- Yeah, here. 
- Perfect.

15:44.946 --> 15:47.423
- What are you doing? 
- This is French toast on the go.

15:47.496 --> 15:48.863
The other drivers on the road love it.

15:49.872 --> 15:52.652
Come here. I'll call you later. We'll plan our weekend.

15:54.066 --> 15:55.764
Hey, Lorelai, hold on a second.

15:57.449 --> 15:58.765
- Here. 
- A key.

15:59.359 --> 16:00.940
Yeah, it's a key to the apartment.

16:01.192 --> 16:02.886
Oh... good.

16:03.567 --> 16:04.658
Do you want me to let someone in?

16:04.833 --> 16:06.767
No, it's just an extra key.

16:06.885 --> 16:08.303
I thought, you know, if you were coming over

16:08.421 --> 16:10.961
and I was running late this way you didn't have to wait in the hallway.

16:11.872 --> 16:14.324
Or if you were carrying something,

16:14.437 --> 16:17.479
and you couldn't wait for me to get to the door... this way, you're all set.

16:17.621 --> 16:19.874
Okay... good. Makes sense.

16:19.993 --> 16:21.754
Yeah, it's just a practical thing. It's not a big deal.

16:21.903 --> 16:23.592
- Oh, good. 
- Or you don't have to take it.

16:23.730 --> 16:25.809
- No, I'll take it. 
- I mean, I know how it is.

16:25.911 --> 16:27.841
You've got your keys on your ring just so,

16:27.923 --> 16:30.882
and then you put in a new one- it throws off the whole balance.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.470
- Well, if you think... 
- Or you can keep it.

16:32.823 --> 16:34.242
- You sure? 
- If you want.

16:34.605 --> 16:36.443
- I can go either way. 
- It's fine with me.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.763
- Well, which way? 
- Either way.

16:37.887 --> 16:41.225
Well, I'll take it, Okay? Thanks for the French toast.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.042
- Thanks for the hand injury. 
- Anytime.

16:45.204 --> 16:45.731
Bye.

16:50.054 --> 16:51.947
Here- it's over here.

16:52.249 --> 16:53.595
Whoa, how did we get a tent?

16:53.729 --> 16:55.468
Toby, again. Classic tip whore.

16:55.624 --> 16:57.808
- Which one's Toby? 
- The one with the bandaged hand.

16:58.050 --> 17:00.533
He cut it setting this up. I popped him another sawbuck.

17:00.809 --> 17:03.011
Cool tent! How'd we get it?

17:03.226 --> 17:06.343
Stay ignorant, Glenn. It comes with the oppressive guilt of the ruling class.

17:06.589 --> 17:09.118
Okay. Hey, Janet. I like your suit.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.224
Thanks, Glenn.

17:10.702 --> 17:12.523
Hey...hot dogs.

17:13.394 --> 17:16.598
Man, it is so loud out here. You never think of the beach as being loud.

17:16.718 --> 17:19.542
You do when there's a band of Huns re-enacting "Top Gun" in back of you.

17:19.800 --> 17:22.539
- Hey! Throw it back. 
- No!

17:23.470 --> 17:24.960
- What are you doing? 
- Putting a towel down.

17:25.063 --> 17:25.973
- Don't. 
- Why?

17:26.088 --> 17:27.700
We have, like, a hundred towels in the room.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.205
There's so many towels, there's basically no room for us.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.907
- I need my ball. 
- You need a couple of 'em, pal.

17:33.818 --> 17:35.964
Here. Ignore her. She likes it.

17:36.742 --> 17:38.883
- Rory, stop. 
- I'm not gonna sit in the sand, Paris.

17:39.512 --> 17:40.131
Over here.

17:42.403 --> 17:44.514
Great....okay. Thanks.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.610
Now, we're going to need a fruit plate in about an hour

17:48.718 --> 17:50.504
and keep the ice tea coming.

17:53.054 --> 17:54.862
- What? 
- Nothing but admiration here.

17:55.010 --> 17:56.777
I'm going to go do my laps in the ocean.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.165
You're gonna work out on spring break?

17:58.282 --> 17:59.838
Exercise is a high. You should try it.

17:59.951 --> 18:00.933
Sure. I'll meet you out there.

18:01.053 --> 18:02.178
Are you properly sun-screened?

18:02.296 --> 18:04.385
Ten minutes in the sun can cause irreparable skin damage.

18:04.543 --> 18:06.577
And constant shoulder tension creates a hunchback.

18:06.874 --> 18:09.209
Fine, go. I hear melanoma is very in this year.

18:09.607 --> 18:11.026
Here, Casper, you better use this.

18:11.144 --> 18:12.633
You're just lucky you got a fruit plate coming.

18:14.297 --> 18:17.313
- Rory, Paris! Oh, my God! 
- Hello, ladies!

18:17.501 --> 18:19.462
Unbelievable. What are you guys doing here?

18:19.698 --> 18:20.463
Spring break!

18:20.606 --> 18:22.662
Actually we came for Tu's spring break and just stayed.

18:22.764 --> 18:24.435
- We've been here a month. 
- They have great lifeguards.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.843
I'm so excited to see you guys.

18:26.074 --> 18:28.136
Paris, you missed a spot. I can see skin.

18:28.838 --> 18:31.224
- So, when did you get here? 
- 2:00 this morning.

18:31.460 --> 18:32.986
I love 2:00 in the morning.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.189
You guys are having a good time?

18:34.358 --> 18:36.984
- Way better than most other people. 
- We're very competitive.

18:37.246 --> 18:40.415
It took a couple of weeks to get the right routine down, but now we own this town.

18:40.523 --> 18:41.817
The chamber of commerce must be thrilled.

18:41.945 --> 18:45.561
I think the last place on earth I would ever expect to find Paris Geller is at spring break.

18:45.689 --> 18:46.850
Hey, I'm up for new things.

18:46.949 --> 18:48.509
Okay, well then we have to make sure you do this right.

18:48.632 --> 18:51.448
- There are rules. 
- There always are in a civilized society.

18:51.536 --> 18:55.361
First of all, it is very important to find the right hot club every night and it changes.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.444
What was hot last night is not tonight.

18:57.560 --> 18:59.918
Also, adjust your sleeping patterns for maximum partying.

19:00.029 --> 19:02.640
Mid-to-late-afternoon sleeping allows the best all-night stamina.

19:02.697 --> 19:03.891
Okay. You got that, Paris?

19:04.040 --> 19:05.467
Were we really friends at one point?

19:05.565 --> 19:07.889
They do card at the clubs, but there's a million ways around it.

19:08.006 --> 19:09.829
- Major flirting... 
- A sexy voice...

19:09.917 --> 19:11.421
And, if all that fails, make out.

19:11.508 --> 19:12.538
- With who? 
- Each other.

19:12.697 --> 19:13.295
Excuse me?

19:13.449 --> 19:15.748
We found that if we kiss each other, we can get anything we want from guys.

19:15.845 --> 19:16.982
Free drinks, food...

19:17.121 --> 19:19.942
- T-shirts, boat rides, Frisbees... 
- Earrings, Seadoos...

19:20.100 --> 19:22.031
Okay. Well, that is a good tip.

19:22.132 --> 19:24.105
Yeah, maybe later I'll pants you for an Altoid.

19:24.258 --> 19:26.024
- Hey, where are you staying? 
- The Sea Sprite.

19:26.126 --> 19:27.611
- That's cute. 
- We've made out there.

19:28.775 --> 19:31.580
- Louise, it's 1:00. 
- We've got to go get to bed.

19:32.261 --> 19:33.320
We'll come see you tonight.

19:34.314 --> 19:36.200
- Hey, guys! 
- How 'bout a lift?

19:37.277 --> 19:39.034
I liked the pants-you-for-an-Altoid thing.

19:42.062 --> 19:43.320
Oh, my God, I'm starving.

19:43.522 --> 19:45.317
I can't believe what a great video store that was.

19:45.399 --> 19:47.139
A little research before a trip never hurts.

19:47.815 --> 19:49.735
Pizza and "The Power of Myth"

19:51.665 --> 19:53.120
A perfect evening.

19:53.969 --> 19:54.482
What?

19:54.989 --> 19:56.893
Nothing- just checking the messages, that's all.

19:57.062 --> 19:58.434
Are you expecting a call from Asher?

19:58.746 --> 20:00.015
No, I'm not expecting a call.

20:00.338 --> 20:03.319
He's at a conference in Denver, so I'm not expecting a call.

20:03.544 --> 20:07.154
I mean, he knows I'm here, and I left him a contact number in case of emergencies,

20:07.225 --> 20:08.929
but not expecting a call.

20:14.799 --> 20:17.423
God, I love this. I've seen it four times.

20:17.638 --> 20:18.919
- Five. 
- Seriously?

20:19.308 --> 20:22.268
It was almost six, but my mom tried to be funny one day and hid it.

20:22.352 --> 20:23.497
I thought you and your mom got along?

20:23.656 --> 20:25.192
Even we have our dark periods.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.276
Wow, it sounds like quite a party out there.

20:29.782 --> 20:31.929
I think someone just got thrown in the pool.

20:32.104 --> 20:34.674
I hope it's the guy who took my five bucks and never brought me a root beer.

20:34.837 --> 20:35.804
This is a good song.

20:36.087 --> 20:39.051
Okay, I'm sorry, are we doing this right?

20:39.241 --> 20:40.531
- Doing what right? 
- Spring break.

20:40.613 --> 20:43.460
I mean, we're in here alone with Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers,

20:43.573 --> 20:45.549
and everyone else is out there with...

20:45.652 --> 20:47.100
- Everyone else? 
- Yeah.

20:47.361 --> 20:50.684
- But... we love Bill Moyers. 
- Yes, we do love Bill Moyers.

20:50.777 --> 20:53.280
But we did come here for spring break, and

20:53.986 --> 20:58.150
I'm just wondering if we're not spring-breaking the way you're supposed to spring break.

20:58.369 --> 20:59.265
You're probably right.

20:59.449 --> 21:01.640
I mean, if we're here, we should probably commit.

21:01.768 --> 21:03.351
Try to experience the entire event.

21:03.474 --> 21:05.297
With other people, outside this room.

21:05.496 --> 21:08.011
Okay. Let's do it. Let's commit.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.690
- Okay. Starting now? 
- Starting now.

21:16.604 --> 21:18.854
- Tomorrow's fine, too. 
- Absolutely.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.013
I got $5 on the blond with the tattoo.

21:33.509 --> 21:34.845
You always go for the tattoos.

21:34.999 --> 21:38.019
God, I'm starving. I haven't had anything but vending-machine junk.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.284
There's nothing around here.

21:39.745 --> 21:41.398
I would kill for something non-synthetic.

21:42.783 --> 21:44.230
Ohh! Perfect.

21:44.936 --> 21:49.360
Okay, forget I said "giant Q-tips." They're not hitting each other with giant Q-tips.

21:49.499 --> 21:52.443
But now I can't get giant Q-tips out of my head. It's too powerful a visual.

21:52.704 --> 21:53.810
I know, I'm sorry.

21:54.420 --> 21:56.324
- So how is it? 
- It's good so far.

21:56.539 --> 21:58.622
- Yeah, how good? 
- I haven't had a drink yet.

21:58.919 --> 22:00.732
Okay, are you sure you weren't drinking,

22:00.814 --> 22:02.190
and that's why you think they're giant Q-tips?

22:04.955 --> 22:06.016
Maybe.

22:06.799 --> 22:07.808
Hello? What just happened?

22:09.769 --> 22:13.160
You sound distracted. Did something cute just walk by?

22:13.838 --> 22:17.766
No, I was just trying to think of something better to describe the...

22:18.268 --> 22:20.485
the giant Q-tips. So I'll call you later, okay?

22:20.628 --> 22:21.857
- No windows. 
- No windows.

22:28.017 --> 22:28.502
What?

22:29.343 --> 22:30.987
- Excellent taste. 
- What's his name?

22:31.581 --> 22:33.858
- Whose name? 
- The guy you were just staring at.

22:34.033 --> 22:35.662
- I wasn't staring. 
- Oh, no.

22:37.075 --> 22:39.008
- The twins. 
- God, they're everywhere.

22:39.324 --> 22:41.103
- So? 
- We can't compete against twins.

22:41.237 --> 22:43.110
Especially once they caught on to the whole kissing thing.

22:43.607 --> 22:44.468
Let's find another pool.

22:44.857 --> 22:46.474
- We'll see you guys tonight. 
- Okay.

22:49.199 --> 22:51.419
Hey, why don't you go get us something at the bar?

22:52.394 --> 22:53.252
What?

22:53.653 --> 22:54.831
Then you can go talk to that guy.

22:58.154 --> 23:00.094
- That's okay. 
- Come on- go.

23:00.252 --> 23:03.641
Flirting seems to be a very big part of this spring break ritual, and I'm taken.

23:03.745 --> 23:06.157
I can't flirt. I have to live vicariously through you.

23:07.575 --> 23:10.652
The banana-eating contest is about to start on the upper level.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.738
- Oh, real food. Thank god. 
- Paris.

23:27.634 --> 23:30.390
Hey, do you know what those things are called

23:30.522 --> 23:32.641
that they hit each other in the pool with?

23:32.842 --> 23:34.469
No, I don't.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.060
Oh, just wondering.

23:39.028 --> 23:41.561
- Do I lose points for that? 
- No, no points lost.

23:42.052 --> 23:43.856
- Hey, Sean, man, come on! 
- Comin'.

23:44.709 --> 23:46.860
- See ya. 
- Oh, okay.

23:47.757 --> 23:48.330
See ya.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.661
Excuse me for thinking a banana-eating contest was about eating a banana!

25:49.452 --> 25:51.610
- You guys want something? 
- Maybe later.

25:52.224 --> 25:52.792
We'll be back.

26:29.610 --> 26:30.476
Wow, quite a scene.

26:30.860 --> 26:32.734
Yeah, I guess we found the hot place tonight.

26:32.964 --> 26:35.473
Yep, no one can sniff out the hip like we can.

26:35.704 --> 26:37.797
Okay, so, here we are.

26:38.416 --> 26:39.559
We should do something.

26:40.517 --> 26:41.544
- What? 
- I don't know.

26:42.738 --> 26:45.497
- We could dance. 
- Dance... okay, sure.

26:45.652 --> 26:47.327
- Let's- let's dance. 
- Okay, let's dance.

26:50.792 --> 26:51.705
- This is fun. 
- Yep.

26:53.467 --> 26:56.957
- Hey, I think your husband's here. 
- What? Where?

27:00.125 --> 27:03.540
- Why don't you go buy him a drink? 
- What, like a nice ginger ale?

27:03.679 --> 27:05.979
Well, maybe you could get Madeline and Louise to buy a drink for you,

27:06.045 --> 27:07.299
and then you could go bring it to him.

27:19.336 --> 27:21.397
Well, that was the shortest relationship ever.

27:21.482 --> 27:21.923
What?

27:22.096 --> 27:23.771
He looked, he saw, he changed his mind.

27:24.109 --> 27:24.615
Sorry.

27:34.231 --> 27:36.591
- Okay, what is going on here? 
- What?

27:36.950 --> 27:39.874
Why is every single person in this place having a better time than we are?

27:40.115 --> 27:41.640
Well, I don't know that they are.

27:42.126 --> 27:45.603
Look around. Every single person in this place is having a better time than we are.

27:45.690 --> 27:48.439
Why? I mean, we've been doing everything everybody else is.

27:48.573 --> 27:50.277
We're here, in the hot place.

27:50.553 --> 27:51.635
So we're not great dancers.

27:51.997 --> 27:54.497
We did the hanging out at the pool part pretty well.

27:54.595 --> 27:55.700
We're not trying hard enough.

27:55.849 --> 27:57.687
What are you talking about? This is not a test.

27:57.921 --> 28:01.036
We came here to do spring break, and we are going to do spring break.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.277
Well, what else do you suggest we do?

28:04.705 --> 28:06.717
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

28:06.984 --> 28:08.096
Well, Madeline and Louise do it.

28:08.381 --> 28:11.403
Madeline and Louise wear their underwear outside of their clothes.

28:11.469 --> 28:13.272
I don't want to do what Madeline and Louise do.

28:13.343 --> 28:15.361
- I just thought... 
- Just stop thinking, okay?

28:15.386 --> 28:17.003
Your thinking is very, very dangerous.

28:17.526 --> 28:19.175
- Rory... 
- Get away from me! You're not my type.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.702
- Will you just wait? 
- What?

28:21.239 --> 28:22.396
- How was I? 
- What?

28:22.543 --> 28:24.024
- As a kisser? 
- Oh, man!

28:24.172 --> 28:26.250
Well, I've always wanted to know, and you can't ask a guy

28:26.338 --> 28:28.914
'cause that's a sign of low self esteem, which I've read is really not sexy.

28:29.005 --> 28:30.628
So tell me- how am I? Too stiff?

28:30.992 --> 28:34.299
Do I need to relax my lips a little, maybe open my mouth more, make it more inviting?

28:34.521 --> 28:35.570
I need some fresh air.

28:36.630 --> 28:39.364
- Hey. Where you goin'? 
- Outside.

28:39.619 --> 28:41.068
- Can I come with you? 
- Oh, well...

28:41.206 --> 28:42.580
Maybe your girlfriend wants to come, too.

28:42.952 --> 28:43.536
My girlfriend?

28:43.736 --> 28:45.318
I gotta tell you- that was some kiss.

28:45.487 --> 28:46.188
Oh, my God!

28:48.411 --> 28:51.062
So the movie was good. Nice to see Michael Caine working again.

28:52.394 --> 28:53.305
Which was sarcastic...

28:54.284 --> 28:56.275
'cause he works a lot...

28:57.453 --> 28:58.337
constantly.

28:59.219 --> 29:02.173
Never says "no" to anything, which can be risky, you know? Lowers your batting average.

29:02.300 --> 29:03.427
Well, I'm glad you liked it.

29:03.969 --> 29:07.748
Jason, you're making me work too hard tonight.

29:07.866 --> 29:08.404
I know.

29:09.258 --> 29:12.392
I mean, I wore the cute boots, you know? Do you see the cute boots?

29:12.788 --> 29:13.830
Very cute boots.

29:13.996 --> 29:15.976
Well, I've had a full night, what with the walking straight,

29:16.090 --> 29:17.995
the balancing, and the not yelping out in pain.

29:18.051 --> 29:20.642
If I'd known I'd also had to do all the talking...

29:20.753 --> 29:21.819
I think I did it wrong.

29:22.463 --> 29:24.588
- You did what wrong? 
- The key that I gave you.

29:24.839 --> 29:26.258
The key... to your apartment?

29:26.401 --> 29:28.163
The key was supposed to say something.

29:28.660 --> 29:29.995
So it's a talking key.

29:30.246 --> 29:35.274
Look, you and I are hitting that point in a relationship where I usually break it off.

29:35.893 --> 29:38.714
Oh, well, gee, should we get a cake?

29:39.887 --> 29:42.652
Every single time with every other woman I've been involved with,

29:42.730 --> 29:43.810
this is about the time that I would...

29:44.573 --> 29:46.097
- Bolt? 
- I was gonna say "run,"

29:46.355 --> 29:48.601
but "bolt" sounds much more masculine, so yeah, sure, "bolt."

29:48.683 --> 29:54.388
Well, it's time to bolt. Okay, good thing you're not wearing my boots.

29:54.536 --> 29:56.297
I don't think I'm doing this right, either.

29:56.588 --> 29:58.412
No, no, you're doing it just fine.

29:59.128 --> 30:00.193
It's cold, so...

30:00.356 --> 30:03.803
The other night I woke up and the timer went off in my head-

30:03.870 --> 30:07.089
"Hey, buddy, it's about that time." So I did what I always do.

30:07.187 --> 30:08.800
I thought about you, and I thought about us,

30:08.897 --> 30:10.510
and I thought about all the things that bother me,

30:11.140 --> 30:13.946
and I came up with nothing.

30:15.032 --> 30:15.477
Nothing?

30:15.897 --> 30:18.973
I went over it and over it in my head.

30:19.588 --> 30:24.283
That feeling, that "I want out" feeling- it wasn't there.

30:24.657 --> 30:29.424
What was there was the very strong sense that if I did... bolt...

30:30.329 --> 30:32.604
I might as well go out and find a pointy hat,

30:32.664 --> 30:34.681
a stool, and a classroom full of sixth graders,

30:34.738 --> 30:38.179
because I'd be an absolute idiot to screw this up.

30:38.553 --> 30:41.000
So I went out and made the key.

30:41.594 --> 30:42.731
The talking key.

30:43.494 --> 30:46.689
And I was hoping that the key would say that this is different,

30:46.904 --> 30:51.122
and that I want you in my life a lot more than you are now.

30:52.828 --> 30:57.452
Well, I mean, it would have been more interesting to hear that from the key...

30:57.840 --> 31:01.070
it's definitely more romantic hearing it from you.

31:08.505 --> 31:10.814
I'm gonna go take care of Mr. Caine for you now.

31:11.065 --> 31:12.017
I would appreciate that.

31:12.586 --> 31:13.000
Good night.

31:13.528 --> 31:14.301
Good night, Jason.

31:25.431 --> 31:26.615
Hey, it's Luke.

31:27.213 --> 31:28.524
I'm sorry to be calling you like this,

31:28.611 --> 31:30.568
but I was wondering if, when you get this message,

31:30.665 --> 31:32.713
you could come pick me up 'cause I need a ride.

31:32.795 --> 31:36.009
I'm in Litchfield, the corner of Mason and Pine.

31:36.148 --> 31:39.571
It's a big, white building. You'll recognize it by the police sign outside

31:39.656 --> 31:41.745
because, oh, hell, I'm in jail.

31:42.487 --> 31:45.139
Okay, there I said it. Long story. I'll tell you when you get here.

31:45.232 --> 31:45.734
Thanks...

31:46.086 --> 31:48.197
if you come. Oh, one more thing.

31:48.314 --> 31:50.393
I need to borrow a little money- 300 bucks.

31:50.490 --> 31:51.923
It's just a loan, and,

31:52.645 --> 31:54.514
oh, hell, it's for my bail.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.454
I'm gettin' off now! Relax!

31:59.767 --> 32:02.066
I think the two of you would make a great couple.

32:02.200 --> 32:03.883
- No way. 
- Why not?

32:04.216 --> 32:06.059
You're way too high maintenance for me.

32:06.275 --> 32:08.148
The whole place was buzzing about the kiss.

32:08.517 --> 32:09.700
Even the twins were jealous.

32:09.860 --> 32:11.850
Super, great. Love to hear that.

32:12.451 --> 32:15.209
Who needs more? Everybody? Good. I'll be right back.

32:17.027 --> 32:19.485
So, Paris, how's the Princeton man?

32:19.709 --> 32:20.595
Jaime and I broke up.

32:21.015 --> 32:22.432
Paris has a different man now.

32:22.643 --> 32:24.328
-  You do? 
- I'm dating a professor.

32:24.553 --> 32:26.043
- Tenured? 
- Ages ago.

32:26.308 --> 32:27.932
Well, Anna Nicole, look at you.

32:28.113 --> 32:31.291
He's brilliant, a writer, very distinguished, handsome.

32:31.373 --> 32:33.748
- Don't you think he's handsome? 
- Handsome? Sure, very handsome.

32:33.984 --> 32:37.067
He's a real man. He's just so amazing.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.920
I still can't believe that we're together, you know?

32:38.992 --> 32:40.993
I made them a little stronger this time.

32:41.178 --> 32:43.487
Oh, cool, it will be fun to watch the cups dissolve.

32:43.661 --> 32:44.993
Paris bagged herself an older man.

32:45.264 --> 32:48.234
Oh, I love older men. They take you to the best restaurants.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.343
He went to a conference in Denver this week.

32:50.486 --> 32:53.527
He was so nice, you know- really excited about me coming to Florida.

32:53.866 --> 32:56.518
He thinks it's a good idea to hang out with people my own age.

32:56.758 --> 32:59.497
I kind of hoped that he would invite me to go to Denver with him but,

32:59.630 --> 33:02.493
- you know, he didn't. 
- He had to work, Paris.

33:02.595 --> 33:04.668
- I know, or he's sick of me. 
- No.

33:05.667 --> 33:06.910
Maybe he's going to dump me.

33:07.476 --> 33:09.215
Does he still buy you jewelry?

33:09.374 --> 33:10.430
He's never bought me jewelry.

33:11.124 --> 33:13.055
He hasn't? How much money does he have?

33:13.189 --> 33:15.129
- Asher isn't rich. 
- Not rich?

33:15.283 --> 33:17.367
Oh, curiouser and curiouser.

33:17.555 --> 33:19.649
You're just being paranoid. He wants you to have fun.

33:19.721 --> 33:22.368
And someone who wants you to have fun is someone who cares about you...

33:22.558 --> 33:26.782
both of you because there are two of you, and they're spinning.

33:27.974 --> 33:28.635
Good punch.

33:28.928 --> 33:31.140
Just keep me away from any windows, please.

33:31.241 --> 33:32.797
Whatever happened to that boyfriend of yours?

33:32.987 --> 33:33.608
Who, Jess?

33:34.099 --> 33:35.752
- No. 
- Oh, Dean.

33:35.895 --> 33:36.761
Dean, that's it.

33:37.088 --> 33:39.879
How's Dean? God, he was gorgeous.

33:40.232 --> 33:42.347
- He's fine. 
- Is he still gorgeous?

33:42.603 --> 33:44.186
Oh, yes. Definitely, yes.

33:44.652 --> 33:46.223
You two aren't together?

33:46.567 --> 33:48.492
No, actually he's married.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.192
- What? 
- Why?

33:50.351 --> 33:53.203
Well, he met Lindsay, and they got married.

33:53.561 --> 33:56.560
She's pretty, blond, tall, leggy.

33:56.736 --> 33:58.910
Oh, good, just what the world needs -- another one of those.

33:59.393 --> 34:01.431
- She's nice, too. 
- Prediction...

34:01.711 --> 34:02.997
- She's psychic. 
- Since when?

34:03.197 --> 34:06.042
Since about six months ago. I think it's not gonna last.

34:06.274 --> 34:09.857
Two married 19-year-olds won't make it- boy, that's a risky bet.

34:09.995 --> 34:12.315
I think it's not gonna last because he was way too in love with you.

34:12.541 --> 34:14.527
No. But we've been broken up for a long time.

34:14.690 --> 34:18.766
But he only had eyes for you, girlfriend- a deep, long, soulful Rory-eyes.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.251
No, not anymore.

34:20.603 --> 34:21.859
You don't talk at all anymore?

34:22.187 --> 34:24.418
No, we still talk. We're still friends.

34:24.721 --> 34:27.009
Yes, you are. Cell phone friends.

34:27.251 --> 34:29.456
You have your ex-boyfriend's number in your cell phone?

34:29.647 --> 34:31.130
I told you we were friends.

34:31.643 --> 34:33.318
First loves are very intense.

34:33.728 --> 34:35.407
My mom's still in love with her first love.

34:35.708 --> 34:38.560
She tells my father that over and over and...

34:39.143 --> 34:40.839
Oops, I think I just dialed his number.

34:41.018 --> 34:43.143
- Madeline, no! 
- Oh, my God, it's ringing!

34:43.465 --> 34:45.052
- Hang up! 
- It's his voice mail.

34:45.524 --> 34:47.424
- Oh, sexy voice.
- Hang up, Madeline !

34:47.525 --> 34:49.996
Oops, I think it's gonna... it beeped.

34:50.889 --> 34:51.380
Talk.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.014
Dean, hi.

34:54.185 --> 34:58.314
It's Rory. I'm sorry to call you like this, but we're on spring break...

34:58.492 --> 35:03.100
And, I don't know if you remember Madeline and Louise, but they're evil,

35:03.306 --> 35:05.737
and we were just talking about you.

35:06.715 --> 35:09.031
Hi. How are you?

35:10.131 --> 35:12.798
I'm gonna hang up now, so bye. Sorry, good-bye.

35:13.469 --> 35:17.100
I'm going to kill you! Oh, my God, I'm so gonna kill you!

35:17.274 --> 35:19.189
It's going to be bad and death-like, and...

35:19.629 --> 35:22.803
I'm gonna go for a walk because this punch is starting to live up to its name.

35:23.003 --> 35:23.791
I'll go with you.

35:24.253 --> 35:26.500
Don't move because I'm going to come back to kill you.

35:26.935 --> 35:27.626
We'll be here.

35:31.564 --> 35:32.644
There- my truck.

35:42.078 --> 35:45.797
You know, Luke, you don't have to tell me what happened unless you want to.

35:47.292 --> 35:51.583
But I promise I won't ask you about it again...

35:52.177 --> 35:54.359
ever... in this lifetime or the next.

35:56.484 --> 35:58.153
You know, I'll just tell Shirley MacLaine,

35:58.621 --> 36:01.603
"Hey, look, back off, Shirl. If Luke had wanted me to know,

36:01.700 --> 36:05.391
he would have told me back in my other lifetime, and I certainly don't expect-"

36:05.478 --> 36:06.989
I wanted to see who owned the socks.

36:07.690 --> 36:08.345
And did you?

36:09.028 --> 36:09.749
I think so.

36:11.018 --> 36:12.503
I just had a feeling tonight.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.571
Nicole was kind of vague on her plans, so...

36:16.323 --> 36:19.636
I told her I'd stay at the diner. And then I drove up here,

36:19.706 --> 36:23.236
and I parked, and I waited. And then this car pulled up,

36:23.342 --> 36:25.064
and she got out with him.

36:26.389 --> 36:30.695
And, they went inside, and I watched them go.

36:31.018 --> 36:32.998
And you're sure he's the owner of the socks?

36:33.198 --> 36:36.066
Well, I didn't ask him, but he's the owner of the socks.

36:36.199 --> 36:39.711
And if he isn't, the picture's still not looking very good.

36:40.141 --> 36:41.088
I agree with you there.

36:41.575 --> 36:44.022
Anyway, I sat here and watched them go inside.

36:44.135 --> 36:47.156
I had all these thoughts rolling around in my head.

36:49.150 --> 36:51.692
I mean, how could she do this, you know?

36:51.779 --> 36:54.022
In there- in our house. I mean, I...

36:55.435 --> 36:57.042
I put bookshelves up in there.

36:57.297 --> 36:59.827
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think he's using your bookshelves.

37:00.048 --> 37:03.217
I suddenly just got so mad, you know, I lost it.

37:04.938 --> 37:08.168
I had to do something, so I got out and marched up to his car,

37:08.368 --> 37:10.443
- and I kicked it. 
- You kicked his car?

37:10.688 --> 37:13.525
Oh, hey, I kicked it hard and over and over and over again.

37:13.847 --> 37:15.322
Oh, you beat up his car.

37:15.485 --> 37:18.004
And then, all of a sudden, these cops pull up,

37:18.090 --> 37:21.512
'cause some busybody in the neighborhood saw some lunatic attacking a car,

37:21.675 --> 37:24.101
and, well, you know the rest.

37:24.701 --> 37:25.382
Did Nicole see you?

37:26.273 --> 37:29.402
I don't know. I don't know what she and the sock man saw. It's just...

37:30.624 --> 37:33.504
God, I feel like such an idiot.

37:34.864 --> 37:38.982
I mean, suddenly I became like one of those guys that gets jealous

37:39.422 --> 37:41.567
and, you know, does crazy things.

37:41.663 --> 37:44.715
Yeah, you weren't "like" one of those guys. You were one of those guys.

37:45.095 --> 37:45.775
Yeah, well...

37:46.973 --> 37:47.834
Was there any damage?

37:48.745 --> 37:49.159
No.

37:52.159 --> 37:52.754
Luke...

37:57.480 --> 37:58.713
Hey, Luke, where are you going?

37:59.681 --> 38:01.356
See? Nothing- not a scratch.

38:01.709 --> 38:04.002
Those stupid dent-resistant panels.

38:04.259 --> 38:06.583
- This is the car? 
- Yes, this is the car.

38:06.957 --> 38:08.912
He sat there. She sat there.

38:09.015 --> 38:11.670
They got out there, walked up there. I jumped out there,

38:11.765 --> 38:14.433
ran up here, was handcuffed there, was driven off there.

38:14.524 --> 38:17.489
I went to jail. And you drove all the way up here to get me...

38:17.597 --> 38:20.064
- and they are still in there! 
- Oh, Luke.

38:20.253 --> 38:22.645
I mean, I can't believe they're still in there. What are they doing?

38:22.803 --> 38:23.515
Luke, come on.

38:23.755 --> 38:25.691
I know what they're doing.

38:26.675 --> 38:29.516
But even if you took one of those pills that they were hawking at the super bowl,

38:29.859 --> 38:32.511
you know, they should have been done in four or five hours, tops.

38:32.582 --> 38:35.219
I mean, that commercial said it all- "If you're still active after four hours,

38:35.337 --> 38:37.816
- you should call a damn doctor." 
- Come on, why don't we...

38:37.924 --> 38:41.139
What are they, talking? Making plans in my house?

38:41.881 --> 38:44.635
- Damn son of a... 
- Luke...

38:45.532 --> 38:50.200
You lying piece of sockless garbage! Why don't you take home my socks, too?

38:50.344 --> 38:53.631
Hey, hey! Luke- Luke, you were busted already once tonight -- that's it.

38:53.784 --> 38:54.851
All right, I'm fine. I'm fine.

38:55.259 --> 38:56.329
- Are you sure? 
- Yeah.

38:56.976 --> 38:58.823
Pretty soon, that car's gonna start fighting back.

38:58.925 --> 39:01.307
I'm fine... really. I'm fine.

39:03.693 --> 39:06.641
You know, Luke, I know I've never really been Miss "This-is-great"

39:06.749 --> 39:11.055
about your relationship, but I am so, so sorry.

39:12.187 --> 39:15.439
You don't deserve this. You really don't deserve this.

39:19.860 --> 39:21.111
I guess that's it.

39:24.392 --> 39:26.881
At least I finally got to see your house.

39:29.242 --> 39:31.853
- Whoo, fresh air is good. 
- Fresh air is healthy.

39:32.759 --> 39:33.589
I'm feeling better.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.220
- Gotta sit. 
- Me too.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.717
- What was in the punch? Did we ask? 
- Nope.

39:40.243 --> 39:42.610
- Should we have asked? 
- That's not what the cool kids do.

39:43.428 --> 39:46.138
I'm loving the spinning beach. How about you?

39:47.074 --> 39:47.889
Oh, yeah.

39:49.982 --> 39:51.304
- So are we done? 
- With what?

39:51.816 --> 39:53.802
Spring break. Are we done?

39:54.328 --> 39:54.924
I don't know.

39:56.654 --> 39:57.924
Well, let's go down the list.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.601
- Okay, we came. 
- Check.

40:00.750 --> 40:02.639
- We danced. 
- Check.

40:03.463 --> 40:04.642
- We drank. 
- Check.

40:04.794 --> 40:07.094
We... threw up.

40:07.734 --> 40:08.394
We didn't throw up.

40:08.728 --> 40:09.894
Give us 10 more minutes.

40:10.590 --> 40:11.150
Right.

40:11.778 --> 40:13.105
Basically, we're done.

40:14.450 --> 40:17.232
I feel like we have officially participated.

40:17.391 --> 40:19.208
We've experienced the entire social ritual.

40:19.479 --> 40:22.822
I have absolutely no desire to ever feel this way again.

40:24.190 --> 40:24.835
Let's go home.

40:25.961 --> 40:27.834
How? We're supposed to stay the rest of the weekend.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.663
Frequent-flyer miles, baby.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.099
Cool peanuts. I'm in.

40:33.252 --> 40:35.617
Great. I'll call as soon as I can get up.

40:36.200 --> 40:36.770
What's that?

40:37.809 --> 40:38.161
What?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.390
Oh, my God!

40:44.645 --> 40:47.230
Glenn! What happened to you?

40:48.054 --> 40:50.066
The last time we saw you, you went to get a hot dog.

40:50.450 --> 40:51.059
Hot dog?

40:52.939 --> 40:53.553
Hot dog.

40:54.874 --> 40:55.375
Hot dog.

41:03.359 --> 41:05.953
You gotta admit, it's been a pretty good trip.

41:08.136 --> 41:10.390
So I call this place where you were supposedly staying,

41:10.469 --> 41:11.974
and some punk at the desk tells me...

41:12.087 --> 41:13.066
I said I was sorry.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.232
"I'm sorry, ma'am, she's not here anymore."

41:15.394 --> 41:17.609
My heart flew out of my chest.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.085
And not just because he called me "ma'am." Which by the way, I hate.

41:20.188 --> 41:21.580
I didn't mean to freak you out.

41:21.754 --> 41:23.996
You don't take off without telling Mommy.

41:24.140 --> 41:26.460
I love that I didn't have to clear it with you to go on spring break,

41:26.552 --> 41:27.970
but I had to clear it with you to come home.

41:28.128 --> 41:31.237
I had visions of you being swallowed by a whale or taking off

41:31.324 --> 41:34.544
with some surfers to go chase the perfect wave and not inviting me.

41:34.673 --> 41:36.259
It just got to be way too much fun.

41:36.373 --> 41:37.862
Yeah? How much is "too much?"

41:38.005 --> 41:39.603
- I had a drink. 
- And?

41:39.894 --> 41:41.472
Paris and I took turns throwing up.

41:41.717 --> 41:43.749
That's the way you girls will find yourselves a husband.

41:43.866 --> 41:47.507
It was fine- aspirin, tons of water, mac and cheese...

41:47.647 --> 41:50.544
Ahh, my baby's discovered her first hangover food.

41:50.808 --> 41:53.821
I wish I had a picture to put next to your clay handprint.

41:53.939 --> 41:55.270
I think I still have the box.

41:55.418 --> 41:56.852
Send it to me. So how was it?

41:56.980 --> 42:00.052
It was interesting, you know? We sat on the beach, went to a club,

42:00.175 --> 42:02.013
we watched "The Power of Myth," Paris and I kissed...

42:02.820 --> 42:05.080
You watched "The Power of Myth"?

42:05.172 --> 42:07.189
- Hold on a sec. 
- I hid that from you!

42:08.418 --> 42:10.984
- Hello? 
- Hey, Rory, it's me.

42:11.454 --> 42:14.890
Hi, Dean. Hold on a sec.

42:15.703 --> 42:16.918
Mom, I have to call you back.

42:17.196 --> 42:19.129
You did not spend spring break with Bill Moyers.

42:19.396 --> 42:19.954
Bye.

42:21.004 --> 42:21.531
Hi.

42:21.960 --> 42:23.839
So, I got your message.

42:24.382 --> 42:25.371
- Oh, yeah? 
- Yeah.

42:25.611 --> 42:28.325
It sounds like you were, uh, having a pretty good time out there.

42:28.551 --> 42:32.048
And I got a lot of questions. I even wrote a couple down. Are you ready?
