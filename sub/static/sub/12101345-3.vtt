WEBVTT

00:44.377 --> 00:48.214
Well, that doesn't look comfortable,
for either of you.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.758
We're fine.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.427
Here. Chow time.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.557
Ah, finally!

01:01.394 --> 01:02.604
Hit me again.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.315
Well, that's all for now. Rations are low.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.276
You can have mine.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.072
Hey, Omega doesn't even
have a place to sleep.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.823
You wanna take her food too?

01:15.492 --> 01:17.035
Oh. Uh...

01:18.203 --> 01:20.246
No, no, thanks. You keep it.

01:20.747 --> 01:21.748
Okay.

01:24.959 --> 01:28.505
I guess I'm not used to
having a kid around here.

01:28.588 --> 01:31.633
Well, none of us are,
but she's not complaining.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.721
Echo, lights cut out again.
I thought you fixed it.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.807
Yeah, add it to the list.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.435
The ship got hit hard
when we fled Saleucami.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.438
Several systems
have been glitching ever since.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.274
Repairs would go faster
if I had some help.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.485
As soon as I finish building this scanner.

01:50.568 --> 01:53.530
Testing the functionality
of our inhibitor chips takes precedence.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.865
But I thought you said
they were defective.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.368
A theory this device
will be able to prove.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.287
Besides,
the ship-wide diagnostic report indicated

02:01.371 --> 02:03.373
no critical systems were compromised.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.426
Getting thrown out of hyperspace.
I'd say that's pretty critical, Tech.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.053
It's not affecting life support.
We're fine.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.805
Are you kidding me?

02:18.888 --> 02:21.433
The power capacitor's blown.
We need to land immediately.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.477
Get ready for your first crash landing.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.271
-Crash?
-Omega, strap in.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.115
I can't see anything!

02:41.411 --> 02:42.787
Hold on!

02:49.627 --> 02:50.920
Ow!

02:58.678 --> 03:00.305
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

03:00.388 --> 03:02.932
We're gonna... be fine.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.184
We're gonna be fine.

03:13.651 --> 03:14.819
Everybody all right?

03:19.074 --> 03:20.617
Is it over?

03:26.206 --> 03:29.626
The storm's getting worse.
It's knocking out our comms.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.837
I suspect one of our capacitors
sustained damage

03:32.921 --> 03:34.798
during our firefight with the regs.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.926
We won't be able to take off
without replacing it.

03:38.009 --> 03:41.805
Inventory analysis indicates
we have one spare onboard.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.350
Is it in here?

03:49.479 --> 03:50.855
What?

03:52.023 --> 03:54.901
That's Crosshair's weapon kit.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.364
Fine.

03:59.447 --> 04:02.283
I'll say it. I kinda miss him.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.202
He shot you, remember?

04:04.285 --> 04:07.497
Ha! I sure do. That hurt!

04:07.580 --> 04:10.417
It's worth noting the possibility
that Crosshair's actions

04:10.500 --> 04:12.877
were influenced by his inhibitor chip.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.170
It can do that?

04:14.754 --> 04:16.423
That's what it was designed to do.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.342
So, it wasn't Crosshair's fault?

04:19.426 --> 04:20.427
Well...

04:20.510 --> 04:23.013
Look, debating this won't fix the ship.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.683
Right now, we need to find that capacitor
and get off this rock.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.907
Greetings, CT-9904.

04:42.991 --> 04:46.703
You will be pleased to know
your vitals are at optimum levels.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.330
Go away.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.417
I am compelled to comply
with your request.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.881
The data shows he's responding favorably
to the procedure.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.009
Let's see if he stays that way.

05:01.926 --> 05:05.472
Ah, Governor Tarkin.
Hope I'm not interrupting.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.557
Right on schedule, Rampart.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.353
I hear your chain code implementation
has been most successful.

05:11.436 --> 05:15.106
Laying the foundation of our new empire
is of the utmost importance.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.900
Indeed.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.487
Is that the enhanced clone
from the report?

05:21.071 --> 05:22.197
It is.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.868
CT-9904 is a top specimen.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.788
What is the status of Project War Mantle?

05:29.871 --> 05:31.206
On schedule, sir.

05:31.289 --> 05:35.794
Our top recruits are here to begin
their training under their new commander.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.929
A strong ruling government
requires an increase in soldiers

05:46.012 --> 05:47.931
to maintain order throughout the galaxy.

05:48.014 --> 05:52.644
Our facilities are fully capable
of creating more clones for the task.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.773
Sustaining such a vast engagement
is not one clones must do alone.

05:56.856 --> 06:00.193
There are other ways
of producing loyal soldiers.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.412
May I present our first Elite Squad.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.835
Top soldiers from across the galaxy.

06:16.918 --> 06:21.172
Imagine more squads like this
being trained by skilled clones.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.134
Together they would make
a formidable army.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.595
A partnership such as this
could have promise.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.559
I believe it will strengthen the future
of this burgeoning Empire.

06:50.368 --> 06:53.288
Careful.
Those capacitors hold a massive charge.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.168
I am well aware. I just need to secure it.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.716
What was that?

07:04.799 --> 07:06.468
I'm a little busy at the moment.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.840
There. That should do it.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.050
Tech...

07:50.762 --> 07:52.514
Look at this.

07:56.184 --> 07:59.479
Ah. Well, those weren't there
when we landed.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.668
What's wrong with you?

08:21.751 --> 08:27.048
Oh! I must've hit my head in the crash.
Ow.

08:27.132 --> 08:30.593
The capacitor's in place,
but other systems are now failing.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.388
Something's causing damage
to the exterior hull.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.265
You wanna narrow that down?

08:47.610 --> 08:50.030
Look!
-What? What is it?

08:50.739 --> 08:54.534
Some kind of creature,
about this big, with a long tail.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.077
It ran off with the part.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.623
She's right. The capacitor's gone.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.542
And that was our last one.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.628
The creature is most likely
an Ordo Moon Dragon.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.506
A species that feeds on raw energy.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.634
It was probably drawn
to the capacitor's electric charge.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.637
Well, that would've been good to know
beforehand, Tech.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.807
You two get those other systems online.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.226
Wrecker, stay here.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.729
I'll go after the dragon
and get our part back.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.356
I'm fine. I--

09:24.439 --> 09:26.024
You're staying.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.525
I'll go with you.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.486
No, that thing could be dangerous.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.280
I'm part of this squad now too, right?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.703
All right, kid.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.039
Just stay close.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.759
Ow!

09:59.099 --> 10:02.310
I didn't join the military
to be studied and poked at.

10:03.186 --> 10:06.564
The war's over.
Who's left for us to fight?

10:07.148 --> 10:11.194
With the Empire, I get paid, I get fed,
and I have a roof over my head.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.823
That's more than the Republic
ever did for me.

10:18.118 --> 10:23.415
Conscripted recruits will never reach
the same level of military proficiency.

10:23.498 --> 10:27.127
Our clones have been trained
since their creation.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.713
Hmm. Skills can be taught.

10:29.796 --> 10:34.884
The loyalty of those who willingly enlist
is what I see tremendous value in.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.472
A tangible test is in order.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.516
We need to see them in action.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.892
By all means.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.562
Send the clone and your recruits
to Onderon.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.815
I want Saw Gerrera's camp
found and wiped out.

10:48.898 --> 10:53.570
Let's see if they can succeed
where Clone Force 99 failed.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.198
It shall be done.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.888
What are you doing?

11:20.638 --> 11:21.639
Tracking.

11:30.899 --> 11:33.193
Could I learn to track like you?

11:33.276 --> 11:35.862
Well, it's an enhanced skill.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.281
Wrecker and Tech, we each have one.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.741
And Crosshair.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.245
You shouldn't be angry at him.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.955
He can't help it.

11:46.039 --> 11:50.835
I'm angry at myself.
We don't leave our own behind.

11:51.670 --> 11:55.006
Then we'll find a way to get him back...
somehow.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.230
Why would they put him in charge?

12:11.606 --> 12:13.149
Problem?

12:13.858 --> 12:15.735
Tell me this, clone.

12:15.819 --> 12:20.448
If you all are so efficient, how come
the Empire's scouting soldiers like us?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.785
Sounds to me like it's time for a change.

12:27.997 --> 12:31.084
Enjoy being commander for now.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.752
We'll see how things shake out.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.687
Sir, just received a transmission
from Gerrera.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.439
He's standing by at the rendezvous.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.357
All right. Let's move out.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.403
-Wait.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.780
A sensor's been triggered in sector 2A.

13:00.864 --> 13:01.990
Alert the others.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.674
-Get our people on the shuttle now!

13:47.369 --> 13:48.828
See it?

13:50.080 --> 13:51.581
Wait here.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.732
It's getting away!

14:20.151 --> 14:21.945
Hunter, your mask!

14:28.660 --> 14:30.787
Hunter, wake up! Wake up!

14:33.039 --> 14:36.292
Echo, Wrecker, Tech, come in!
We need help!

14:46.845 --> 14:52.058
Okay, Omega. You can do this.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.971
Where's Gerrera?

16:12.055 --> 16:14.641
I don't know,
but I wouldn't tell you if I did.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.063
I believe you.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.858
Do any of you have information
you'd like to share?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.151
We don't know anything.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.612
We were promised transport off world,
that's all.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.407
Then you're of no use to the Empire.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.910
What are you doing?
Gerrera's fighters are dead.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.663
These are civilians.
We should bring them in.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.374
Those weren't our orders.

16:39.457 --> 16:42.335
Forget our orders. This is wrong.

16:42.419 --> 16:45.588
So, you're not going to comply?

16:45.672 --> 16:48.425
No. None of us are.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.551
Ignore the clone.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.554
We signed up to be soldiers,
not an execution squad.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.765
We're going to detain the prisoners
and take them in for questioning.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.643
You want to know
why they put me in charge?

17:00.770 --> 17:04.107
It's because I'm willing to do
what needs to be done.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.492
Good soldiers follow orders.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.787
Finish the mission.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.327
There it is!

17:59.704 --> 18:01.164
Guess I got lucky.

18:20.684 --> 18:21.768
Omega!

18:25.355 --> 18:26.398
Omega!

18:42.580 --> 18:44.374
Omega!

19:27.584 --> 19:29.169
Omega!

19:29.252 --> 19:30.462
I'm coming!

19:39.137 --> 19:40.972
Are you okay?

19:41.056 --> 19:43.099
What were you thinking going down there?

19:43.183 --> 19:45.643
The mission was to retrieve
the capacitor, wasn't it?

19:46.227 --> 19:48.646
I tracked the dragon, like you did.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.440
Is that my blaster?

19:51.107 --> 19:53.401
Don't worry. I didn't have to use it.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.111
I got the part.

20:15.006 --> 20:18.218
It appears your squad is one trooper down.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.888
Unfortunate,
but soldiers know the risks of battle.

20:23.014 --> 20:28.019
Gerrera was already gone,
but the rest of his camp was dealt with.

20:31.815 --> 20:32.899
Impressive.

20:32.982 --> 20:36.277
The Clone Commander's new squad
has followed through

20:36.361 --> 20:38.238
where his brethren did not.

20:38.321 --> 20:41.491
Further proof
that this initiative has potential.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.787
The Clone Trooper program
is a cost prohibitive relic of the past,

20:45.870 --> 20:50.083
but until the time is right,
it will continue to serve a purpose.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.210
With more time and training,

20:52.293 --> 20:55.588
our forces will be unlike anything
the galaxy has seen.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.844
Then I leave this project
in your capable hands, Admiral.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.221
Thank you, sir.

21:08.393 --> 21:11.021
If Rampart has his way,

21:11.104 --> 21:14.691
conscripted soldiers
will make clones obsolete.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.819
I fear for the future of our operation.

21:17.902 --> 21:21.614
We must ensure our clones
remain essential.

21:21.698 --> 21:27.203
The original genetic material
from Jango Fett continues to degrade.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.415
Then it is time to begin the next phase.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.835
If your experiment
can yield a superior clone,

21:33.918 --> 21:37.380
it will secure our relationship
with this Empire.

21:37.464 --> 21:42.093
Such a contingency cannot be
created without a direct source.

21:42.844 --> 21:45.930
The clones required
will not return willingly.

21:46.014 --> 21:51.144
They are Kaminoan property,
and we only need one.

21:51.227 --> 21:54.439
Our survival hinges on it.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.307
Tech, get us outta here.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.475
Gladly.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.779
Systems are up and running.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.489
Yeah, took you long enough.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.616
And where have you been?

22:46.700 --> 22:49.536
Hey, kid. Come with me.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.590
Okay. Open 'em.

23:03.216 --> 23:06.011
Check it out!

23:19.232 --> 23:21.735
It's your own room.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.578
Well, what do you think?

23:31.661 --> 23:33.997
I thought this place
could feel more like a home.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.915
It's perfect.

23:35.999 --> 23:37.459
Thank you, Wrecker.

23:37.542 --> 23:41.296
Oh, uh, it was nothing.

23:46.634 --> 23:49.095
I never had my own room before.

23:49.679 --> 23:53.058
Well, you're a part of this squad now too.
