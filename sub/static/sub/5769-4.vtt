00:02.170 --> 00:03.262
Previously on The Good Wife...
ALICIA: What's wrong?

00:03.300 --> 00:05.222
DAVID:
Over the past month,

00:05.270 --> 00:07.534
the fourth year associates
have called our top clients.

00:07.570 --> 00:09.561
DIANE:
We're worried they're thinking
of leaving with them.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.429
Do you have any insight?

00:10.470 --> 00:12.176
We need to leave
by the end of the week.

00:12.210 --> 00:13.472
People want to
wait for bonuses.

00:13.510 --> 00:14.704
We can't keep fooling
the partners.

00:14.740 --> 00:17.106
I gave an interview
to the Law Advocate.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.071
What did you say?

00:18.110 --> 00:19.475
I talked about the money,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.613
the $45,000
that you took.

00:21.650 --> 00:23.584
WILL:
We negotiate an exit package.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.440
Diane gave an interview that
exposed the firm to criticism.

00:25.490 --> 00:26.809
We're getting
calls from clients.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.259
This is my firm.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.655
It was your firm.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.425
(indistinct chatter)
(phone ringing)

00:44.540 --> 00:47.577
What's this? I asked for the
Greenberg deposition from March,

00:47.610 --> 00:50.477
not November. Are you deaf?

00:53.680 --> 00:55.716
You're the paralegal
who's good with computers.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.446
Could you help with my laptop
in about ten minutes?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.118
Oh, good, I need some help
moving boxes

01:01.160 --> 01:03.378
out of Diane's office
when you get a chance.

01:05.460 --> 01:07.451
I'll take it.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.198
Hey, Chrissy, how are you?
Okay.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.867
Uh, hey, Alicia, do
you have a minute?

01:13.900 --> 01:16.562
Um, not right now.
How 'bout in an hour?

01:16.610 --> 01:18.532
Sure.

01:18.570 --> 01:19.502
What's wrong?

01:19.540 --> 01:21.428
Nothing.
I'm just...

01:21.480 --> 01:23.675
It's hard.
I know,

01:23.710 --> 01:26.144
but it's good experience, and
you'll make a lot of connections

01:26.180 --> 01:27.716
for when you pass the bar.
I guess.

01:27.750 --> 01:29.411
ALICIA:
Uh...

01:29.450 --> 01:31.611
Chrissy, I'll be right back.
No.

01:31.650 --> 01:33.618
It's all right.
I figured out what I want to do.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.150
What do you mean?

01:35.190 --> 01:36.782
Nothing. Everything's good.

01:40.730 --> 01:42.823
We're having trouble
downloading files.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.269
You shouldn't be talking here.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.667
Don't worry. Everybody just
thinks we're discussing
the Zimbalist depo.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.668
I spent the whole afternoon
trying to download files to take

01:49.710 --> 01:51.530
with us, but there's some sort
of firewall in the way.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.300
It's_ David Lee. He's still
suspICIous that we're leaVIng.

01:54.340 --> 01:56.171
The clients are coming with us,
right? Once they come with us,

01:56.210 --> 01:57.905
Lockhart/Gardner doesn't own
the files. The clients do.

01:57.950 --> 01:58.905
Right, but
they can delay

01:58.950 --> 02:00.577
delivering the files to us.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.019
Once all hell breaks loose,
they're not gonna want

02:02.050 --> 02:04.610
to lift a finger for us.
CARY: They'll have to.
The clients will sue.

02:04.650 --> 02:07.653
CAREY: So? Lockhart/Gardner
will just absorb the
suit, knowing we can't

02:07.690 --> 02:10.352
do a good job representing
our clients without their files.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.620
I agree. Hey, we're stealing
their clients.

02:12.660 --> 02:14.423
No, no, no. We're not stealing.
We're not stealing.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.564
Okay, okay. Either way, they're
gonna think we're stealing them.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.669
They're gonna be pissed.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.531
CARY:
All right, all right.
So what do we do?

02:19.570 --> 02:20.798
CAREY:
Well...

02:20.840 --> 02:22.660
partners can get
around the firewall.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.666
No.

02:24.710 --> 02:26.507
(sighs)
No,

02:26.540 --> 02:28.405
that would be wrong.
You don't have
to do all the files,

02:28.440 --> 02:29.668
just the new ones.

02:29.710 --> 02:30.699
Diane's cases.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.770
(quietly):
Hey, hey, hey.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.209
What's this?

02:35.250 --> 02:36.717
The Zimbalist deposition.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.718
Oh.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.251
I need the paralegal,
the brunette one.

02:42.290 --> 02:43.928
Where is she?
I don't know.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.724
She's probably helping Will
in Diane's office.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.921
Okay.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.565
Good luck
with the Zimbalist deposition.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.648
So, this is
surprising.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.807
Hi, Viola.
How are you?

03:05.850 --> 03:07.647
I'm good, Will.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.786
And it's always good
to see you, especially

03:10.820 --> 03:12.788
_ in such
a triumphant state.

03:12.820 --> 03:14.754
So, what do you need, Viola?

03:14.790 --> 03:16.326
Oh, may I?

03:16.360 --> 03:18.385
You know, Diane and I were
great friends in law school.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.728
But we were always in
competition, the same jobs,

03:20.760 --> 03:22.660
the same boyfriends,
same everything.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.725
So this judgeship
is hitting quite hard.

03:24.770 --> 03:25.725
You want one.

03:25.770 --> 03:27.795
(chuckles)
That would be nice.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.661
But I feel
that her advancement started

03:30.710 --> 03:32.735
when she stole...

03:32.780 --> 03:36.409
Actually, you both stole
a client from me.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.803
DAVID:
Have you seen
that paralegal?

03:37.850 --> 03:38.999
What's her name?
No, I haven't
seen her.

03:39.050 --> 03:41.518
Oh. That's why I'm here.
Your paralegal.

03:41.550 --> 03:42.744
She's suing you.

03:43.920 --> 03:44.887
Chrissy is suing us?

03:44.920 --> 03:46.319
And Diane.
And the firm.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.258
For what?

03:47.290 --> 03:48.416
For a hostile work environment.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.984
That bitch.
I can't believe it.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.351
David.
(chuckles)

03:52.400 --> 03:53.697
No, that's okay.

03:53.730 --> 03:55.823
There's a lot worse_than that
In the complaints.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.498
Something, unfortunately,

03:57.530 --> 03:59.760
that might upset
Diane's confirmation.

03:59.800 --> 04:00.664
So this is between you and Diane

04:00.700 --> 04:03.464
and we're just
collateral damage?
No.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.637
This is between a firm
and a paralegal,

04:05.670 --> 04:07.809
and we're all just slaves
to the facts.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.745
(gunshots)

04:12.780 --> 04:14.816
(chuckling):
Whoa.

04:14.850 --> 04:16.818
(chuckles)

04:16.850 --> 04:19.614
You're getting better.
I'm getting out
my aggressions.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.911
It's a turn-on.

04:20.960 --> 04:23.451
(phone ringing)
(chuckles)

04:23.490 --> 04:25.822
Oh...

04:25.860 --> 04:27.498
McVEIGH:
Work again?

04:27.530 --> 04:28.792
Go ahead, take it. I'm fine.

04:28.830 --> 04:29.990
No.

04:30.030 --> 04:33.295
Finally, I don't have
to take it.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.962
ELI:
We have to talk
about the inauguration.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.434
No, you have to talk

04:38.470 --> 04:39.971
about it. I...

04:41.010 --> 04:42.671
What's that mean?

04:44.080 --> 04:45.843
Six days.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.019
Unﬁlyou
leave? Oh.

04:48.050 --> 04:50.018
I'm gonna miss
this office.

04:50.050 --> 04:50.982
You sure you want to go?

04:51.020 --> 04:53.716
Okay, Eli.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.785
What's the problem?
You told Nora

04:55.820 --> 04:58.084
you want the inaugural ball
moved to the governor's mansion,

04:58.130 --> 05:00.826
but traditionally it's held
at Exposition Hall,

05:00.860 --> 05:02.964
and I'm getting some
trouble from the unions.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.968
Wait, what?
_ You want the
Inaugural ball moved

05:05.000 --> 05:07.093
to the governor's mansion,
but the _unions are
threatening to strike

05:07.140 --> 05:10.735
if we move it _
because It's a non-union...
Okay, waIt, ElI, wait.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.931
I never said anything.
I don't know what you heard,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.733
but your office called me

05:15.780 --> 05:17.099
and asked me if it would
be fine to move the ball

05:17.150 --> 05:19.573
to the governor's mansion,
and I told them

05:19.620 --> 05:22.111
what I'm telling you:
I don't care.
So you...

05:22.150 --> 05:24.482
didn't ask for it to be moved
to the governor's man5|on?
Does it sound

05:24.520 --> 05:26.909
like me to say I want it moved
to the governor's mansion?
Nora said

05:26.960 --> 05:29.781
that Mrs. Florrick insisted...

05:29.830 --> 05:30.854
And there you go.

05:30.890 --> 05:32.755
I have a partners' meeting.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.791
Good luck.

05:36.830 --> 05:39.867
Nora, is Mrs. Florrick there?

05:39.900 --> 05:41.595
N-No.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.062
The Mrs. Florrick that asked
for the inaugural

05:43.110 --> 05:44.839
to be moved to the mansion.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.977
Hello, Mr. Gold. How are you?

05:55.520 --> 05:56.680
WOMAN:
Diane.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.585
My God.
Look at you.

05:58.620 --> 06:01.453
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Fran, Lyle, hi!

06:01.490 --> 06:02.923
It's been forever.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.723
Well, we were in Lyon
for the spring.

06:04.760 --> 06:05.988
You look fantastic.

06:06.030 --> 06:08.021
Well, thank you.
And this is Kurt.

06:08.060 --> 06:10.858
Good to meet you. Yes.
Ah, you must be
the lucky gentleman.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.539
DIANE: These are my oldest
friends, Francesca and Lyle.
Oh.

06:13.570 --> 06:14.332
I set them up.

06:14.370 --> 06:16.031
Blind date, right out
of law school.

06:16.070 --> 06:18.436
Which reminds me,
I heard Viola was in town.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.437
Did you see her?

06:19.480 --> 06:20.936
Viola Walsh? No.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.743
And what have you
two been doing today?

06:22.780 --> 06:24.873
You... smell
like you've been camping.

06:24.910 --> 06:25.899
That's gunpowder.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.508
(Francesca and Lyle laugh)

06:27.550 --> 06:28.869
We were out shooting
this morning.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.138
Guns? Really?

06:31.190 --> 06:32.782
A Smith & Wesson...

06:32.820 --> 06:33.889
Model 29.
Model 29.
Well then,

06:33.920 --> 06:35.911
that's a new side
of you, Diane.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.849
(phone ringing)
Oh, sorry. Do you mind?

06:40.460 --> 06:41.620
I have to take this.

06:43.630 --> 06:46.736
Are you a hunter, Mr...

06:46.770 --> 06:47.634
McVeigh.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.831
Oh, McVeigh. Like-like,
uh, the other...

06:49.870 --> 06:51.167
like the other McVeigh?
What other?

06:51.210 --> 06:53.178
Uh, the one
who, um, uh...

06:53.210 --> 06:54.905
You know, the one...
He's dead now. Um, uh...

06:54.940 --> 06:56.874
FRANCESCA: Nixon?
No, the one who,
uh, you know...

06:56.910 --> 06:58.946
Blew up the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building

06:58.980 --> 07:00.641
in Oklahoma City?

07:00.680 --> 07:03.843
Yeah.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.448
Will, what's going on?

07:05.490 --> 07:06.855
It's your old friend,
Viola Walsh.

07:06.890 --> 07:08.448
She's suing us.

07:08.490 --> 07:10.128
She got one of our paralegals
to accuse us.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.048
Well, I don't know
what that has to do with me.

07:12.090 --> 07:13.796
You all pushed me out, remember?

07:13.830 --> 07:16.094
She's saying
you sexually harassed her.

07:16.130 --> 07:18.860
I... She what?

07:18.900 --> 07:20.868
How's that gonna look to your
friends in the Supreme Court?

07:20.900 --> 07:23.733
This is what I say:
she slimes us, we slime her.

07:23.770 --> 07:25.931
We got Kalinda on this,
find out everything in her past,

07:25.970 --> 07:26.777
everything we can use.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.971
Wait. Who said
that I harassed her?

07:29.010 --> 07:30.238
Chrissy Quinn.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.147
She said that you asked her to
prostitute herself to a client,

07:33.180 --> 07:36.013
that... Cary showed her
how he masturbated

07:36.050 --> 07:37.847
and I asked her
how she lost her virginity.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.881
And I tried to rape her.
I don't even know who she is.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.026
Do you realize the United States
has the highest percentage

07:43.060 --> 07:44.755
of civilian_
gun ownership...

07:44.790 --> 07:46.052
Slime her-- that's what I say.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.854
This is blackmail.
They want a quick settlement.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.061
It's Viola Walsh, Diane.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.136
She's got an issue
with your judgeship.

07:53.170 --> 07:56.833
(sighs)
Tell me what you need me to do.

07:56.870 --> 07:59.031
So you don't think Sandy Hook
changed anything?
I think

07:59.070 --> 08:01.732
that the Second Amendment keeps
everything from being changed.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.941
But did you see
those kids' bodies?

08:03.980 --> 08:05.800
Did you see the photos?
What I don't understand

08:05.850 --> 08:07.977
is how your guns could matter
more than that.
I didn't say that.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.749
You're making that connec...
DgANE:
o...

08:09.790 --> 08:11.018
(clears throat)

08:11.050 --> 08:12.039
How we doing?

08:12.090 --> 08:13.057
Good, I think.

08:13.090 --> 08:15.183
Great.
FRANCESCA:
Well,

08:15.220 --> 08:16.778
I think we should, um...

08:16.830 --> 08:18.650
We're meeting
some friends, Diane.

08:18.690 --> 08:20.920
Join us. We're almost done.
LYLE:
No, no. We'll-we'll call you.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.723
We'll-we'll arrange
lunch some other time.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.499
Okay, say hi
to the kids.
Okay.

08:29.070 --> 08:31.038
Stimulating conversation?

08:31.070 --> 08:33.277
Your friends have
some strong opinions.

08:33.310 --> 08:34.937
So does my fianc.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.141
You knew that about me.

08:38.180 --> 08:40.273
I did.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.619
If we settle for $2 million,
insurance will cover 40%, but...

08:43.650 --> 08:44.548
we may lose some clients.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.558
No, we fight it.
Then we have to move quick.

08:46.590 --> 08:49.627
So who do we get
to represent us?

08:49.660 --> 08:53.027
(beeping)
I'm sorry. I have to hit
10,000 paces or my Bangle

08:53.060 --> 08:54.948
gets mad at me.
We'd like to hire_
you, Ms. Tascronl.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.627
Actually, we're considering

08:56.670 --> 08:59.298
hiring you.
We're being sued
by a female paralegal

08:59.330 --> 09:01.730
for being a hostile workplace.
And...

09:01.770 --> 09:03.567
how long has this paralegal
worked for you?

09:03.610 --> 09:05.339
Two years. Why?
I don't know.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.201
I keep asking questions
until they make sense.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.208
And... who's
representing her?

09:09.240 --> 09:11.071
Viola Walsh,
a lawyer from LA,

09:11.110 --> 09:13.078
but she's opening up offices
here.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.041
Is she tall?

09:14.080 --> 09:15.172
ALICIA:
A bit.

09:15.220 --> 09:16.073
Five-seven?

09:17.620 --> 09:18.348
You're kidding me.

09:18.390 --> 09:20.187
The worry, Ms. Tascioni,

09:20.220 --> 09:22.108
is that we're in _
a transrtlon period at the fIrm

09:22.160 --> 09:24.151
and that this suit
could be used to hurt us.

09:24.190 --> 09:25.748
(beeping)
So...

09:25.790 --> 09:28.258
you think this suit
is about your transition period.

09:28.300 --> 09:29.119
Yes.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.798
Okay. Then we move fast.

09:30.830 --> 09:33.230
Call this tall lawyer's bluff.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.158
Arrange
depositions now.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.758
And I'll get
your investigator...

09:36.810 --> 09:38.038
um, Kalinda, right?

09:38.070 --> 09:39.776
Right.
I'll get her
looking into this...

09:39.810 --> 09:41.732
paralegal's
background.

09:41.780 --> 09:44.248
Slime her_
before she can slime you.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.374
When can you start?

09:48.420 --> 09:51.787
*

09:51.820 --> 09:53.788
* I got the devil inside,
he's a political man *

09:53.820 --> 09:55.788
* He turns my money
into his own religion *

09:55.820 --> 09:57.856
* Teaching the nation,
makes realization *

09:57.890 --> 10:01.291
* I got this real bad, bad,
a real, real bad feeling. *

10:06.200 --> 10:07.997
JACKIE:
To the right.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.735
A little
to the left.

10:09.770 --> 10:10.566
To the left. Good.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.362
And you can put the seal
over there.

10:12.410 --> 10:14.731
So, Jackie,

10:14.780 --> 10:16.236
what are we doing here?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.748
Rearranging.
Mm-hmm.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.668
Do you think the seal
would look good there?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.415
There? Why not the men's room?

10:22.450 --> 10:25.044
(chuckles)
Mr. Gold.
Take it down and put the seal

10:25.090 --> 10:27.308
back up in its place.
What are you doing, Mr. Gold?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.248
Putting the state seal back up

10:29.290 --> 10:31.383
and keeping every reporter
from asking if the governorship

10:31.430 --> 10:33.853
has gone to Peter's head.
He won, Eli.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.255
It's not wrong to put
such a beautiful portrait

10:36.300 --> 10:37.324
in a place of
prominence.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.362
Hmm, maybe it's not wrong,
Jackie, but it is stupid.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.361
Perhaps you and I should
have a little talk, hmm?

10:49.210 --> 10:50.700
Put the seal back!

10:50.750 --> 10:52.741
Yes, sir.

10:52.780 --> 10:56.318
Jackie, you and I
have had some...

10:56.350 --> 10:58.318
times together.

10:58.350 --> 11:00.682
We have... over the years.

11:00.720 --> 11:04.451
_ And we've had some...
disagreements along the way.

11:04.490 --> 11:06.720
Not so many.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.728
But now your
son is governor,

11:08.760 --> 11:11.092
and any disagreement
results in bigger issues,

11:11.130 --> 11:13.132
so we need to stop.

11:14.270 --> 11:16.329
Whenever you want
something changed

11:16.370 --> 11:17.837
around here, no
matter how small,

11:17.870 --> 11:20.771
no matter how insignificant,
you have to ask.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.437
Certainly.
No.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.209
You have to ask me.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.706
Not Peter,
not Alicia.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.877
Not the little fairies
that sit on your shoulder.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.376
Just me.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.388
He's my son, Eli.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.888
You can't keep me
from speaking to my son.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.024
I can, actually.

11:37.060 --> 11:39.085
You don't want to challenge
me on this, Jackie.

11:39.130 --> 11:40.097
Not the campaign manager

11:40.130 --> 11:43.395
that got his candidate elected
by six points.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.489
I'll talk to Peter.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.361
Do that.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.300
I'll have him call you
in 20 minutes.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.229
The call will last
exactly four minutes, so,

11:53.280 --> 11:54.372
keep it quick.

11:54.410 --> 11:56.901
(door slams shut)

11:56.950 --> 11:58.349
ELSBETH:
HI.

11:58.380 --> 12:00.416
Hi.

12:00.450 --> 12:04.238
Christina Quinn, the paralegal
who used to work here--

12:04.290 --> 12:06.144
I need everything
that you can find on her.

12:06.190 --> 12:08.055
Dirt?
Yes.

12:08.090 --> 12:10.058
Work history,
sexual history.

12:10.090 --> 12:11.853
Anything that would be...

12:11.890 --> 12:13.994
Where do you get
your hair done?

12:14.030 --> 12:16.965
Where? Uh, I don't know.
Different places.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.820
I wish my hair would behave.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.929
It just flops. Just...

12:20.970 --> 12:23.734
I flop it this way
or that way.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.478
You knew this paralegal?

12:27.510 --> 12:29.478
Uh, the one suing us? Yeah.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.546
What do you think of her?

12:31.580 --> 12:33.241
I think she's very... young.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.248
You read her accusations?

12:35.280 --> 12:36.247
Yes.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.317
She accused everybody
of improprieties but you.

12:39.350 --> 12:40.419
Yeah, I saw that.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.553
Are her accusations true?

12:42.590 --> 12:43.955
No.

12:43.990 --> 12:45.127
But you're hesitant?

12:45.160 --> 12:47.549
No. I just think some things
are open to interpretation.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.922
Do you think sexual harassment
is open to interpretation?

12:50.970 --> 12:52.528
No.

12:52.570 --> 12:53.935
(beeping)

12:56.840 --> 12:59.058
Look at us--
out to save the world.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.429
Who took that?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.505
FRANCESCA:
Viola Walsh, wasn't it?
Mm.

13:02.540 --> 13:04.940
So, here you are
in my apartment

13:04.980 --> 13:06.845
for the first time
In ﬁve years,

13:06.880 --> 13:10.213
and my guess is that you have
something to get off your chest.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.979
Are we that obvious?

13:12.020 --> 13:13.988
A bit. What is it?

13:14.020 --> 13:15.817
How well
do you know Kurt?

13:16.860 --> 13:18.521
LYLE:
What?

13:18.560 --> 13:21.393
He disagrees with you
about the right to bear arms.

13:21.430 --> 13:23.489
Look, he disagrees with me
about that.

13:23.530 --> 13:25.066
I disagree with him.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.419
It's not a stumbling block.

13:26.470 --> 13:28.392
FRANCESCA:
But his views, Diane.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.408
All his views. _
He supports Sarah PaIIn.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.907
I know.
I can't believe it.

13:31.940 --> 13:35.068
I fell in love
with a Palin supporter. (laughs)

13:35.110 --> 13:36.236
It's not funny, Diane.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.542
Do you see her?
She's back on Fox.

13:37.580 --> 13:39.377
Oh, you don't watch Fox.

13:39.410 --> 13:41.071
They show clips on Jon Stewart.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.246
His views on Obama

13:42.280 --> 13:43.110
and secessionism.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.879
Okay, so, what is this,
an intervention?

13:44.920 --> 13:46.046
No, it's just...

13:46.090 --> 13:48.354
Issues matter.

13:48.390 --> 13:51.427
I know we're all supposed
to disagree and smile

13:51.460 --> 13:54.588
and go home and pretend
it's all some big tennis match,

13:54.630 --> 13:57.599
but people end up poorer,
guns end up

13:57.630 --> 13:58.460
killing people.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.559
Global warming keeps
destroying our...

14:00.600 --> 14:02.261
So, you're saying
I shouldn't be happy?

14:02.300 --> 14:03.506
No, what we're saying

14:03.540 --> 14:05.508
is, do you really know
who this guy is?

14:05.540 --> 14:07.599
Do you know his religion,
his politics?

14:07.640 --> 14:10.370
Thanks for stopping by,

14:10.410 --> 14:12.640
but I actually
do have to go to work.
No.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.511
Diane, please,
just sit and talk.

14:14.550 --> 14:16.370
Fran, Lyle,

14:16.420 --> 14:18.513
ifI fell into a life
of addiction,

14:18.550 --> 14:22.509
then, please, do intervene,
but don't for this.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.879
Not for love.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.329
The best advice

14:25.360 --> 14:28.022
you ever gave me, Diane,
when I met Lyle was,

14:28.060 --> 14:30.927
make sure your love can survive
outside the bubble.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.165
I give it back to you.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.904
(beeping)

14:38.440 --> 14:40.408
How long have you worked
at Lockhart/Gardner?

14:40.440 --> 14:41.532
Shall we say hello first?

14:41.580 --> 14:42.945
(sighs)
Hello.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.538
How long have you worked at

14:44.580 --> 14:45.672
Lockhart/Gardner?

14:45.710 --> 14:47.075
Two years.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.417
Who hired you?

14:48.450 --> 14:50.543
Alicia... Florrick.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.410
What were
your dutIes?

14:52.450 --> 14:54.554
Paralegal.

14:54.590 --> 14:57.252
Uh, typing up briefs,
researching cases,

14:57.290 --> 14:59.019
making copies,
that sort of thing.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.597
How did you lose
your virginity?

15:01.630 --> 15:02.927
Objection.
How is that relevant?

15:02.970 --> 15:04.164
Chrissy charged
in her complaint

15:04.200 --> 15:06.566
that Alicia Florrick asked her
how she lost her virginity,

15:06.600 --> 15:09.489
so I'm just asking,
what was the answer?

15:09.540 --> 15:11.508
I... didn't answer.

15:11.540 --> 15:13.679
Was there anyone else there
when she asked you this?

15:13.710 --> 15:17.999
Myself, Cary Agos, our client
and six other associates.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.244
And the issue
of virginity came up?

15:19.280 --> 15:20.508
Well, it didn't come up.

15:20.550 --> 15:24.714
The lawsuit was about someone
seIIIng theIr VIrgInIty onIIne,

15:24.750 --> 15:27.287
_and_ the difference between
ImpIIed and eprICIt contract.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.379
ELSBETH:
In other words,
you didn't bring up

15:29.420 --> 15:31.957
the issue of virginity,
it was the issue of the lawsuit?

15:31.990 --> 15:33.628
Do you want to take over
the questioning?
Sure.

15:33.660 --> 15:35.696
Was virginity the
subject of the lawsuit?

15:35.730 --> 15:36.526
Yes.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.664
And how did you come
to ask Chrissy

15:38.700 --> 15:39.792
about her loss
of virginity?

15:39.830 --> 15:42.492
The other associates were
dIscussmg theIr experIences,

15:42.540 --> 15:44.508
and I saw Chrissy
laugh to herself.

15:44.540 --> 15:47.703
I thought she had something she
wanted to share, so I asked her,

15:47.740 --> 15:50.300
did she have something to add?

15:51.550 --> 15:52.608
Those were your
exact words?

15:52.650 --> 15:54.049
They were.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.240
Wow.

15:55.280 --> 15:56.713
I can see why you're suing.

15:56.750 --> 15:58.638
VIOLA:
Then what happened?

15:58.690 --> 16:01.659
Cary Agos asked me to stay late
on the Ginsberg case.

16:01.690 --> 16:03.555
And this was
a sexual case, too?

16:03.590 --> 16:04.750
Yes, prostitution.

16:04.790 --> 16:07.759
Lockhart/Gardner just seems
to obsess on these sexual cases.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.995
Is that a question?
No.

16:10.030 --> 16:11.167
It's just an odd observation.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.667
Then what happened

16:12.700 --> 16:15.396
during your late-night work
on this case?

16:15.440 --> 16:18.000
Cary showed me how
he masturbated.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.632
And how did he show you this?

16:19.670 --> 16:21.501
With his hand?

16:21.540 --> 16:24.543
Uh... his right hand?

16:24.580 --> 16:27.242
VIOLA:
And it was just
the two of you?

16:27.280 --> 16:28.440
Yes.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.311
And what was being
discussed at the time?

16:30.350 --> 16:31.317
A plea bargain.

16:31.350 --> 16:33.659
The State's Attorney offered
to sit down with us

16:33.690 --> 16:34.759
and discuss a plea
of three years.

16:34.790 --> 16:37.258
And you didn't think
much of it?
No. No, I didn't.

16:37.290 --> 16:40.657
So, when Chrissy reported this
offer to you, what did you do?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.099
I made a gesture.

16:42.130 --> 16:44.462
A gesture of-of masturbation?

16:44.500 --> 16:45.762
Yes.
And

16:45.800 --> 16:48.792
by this gesture,
did you mean...

16:48.840 --> 16:50.728
this is how
I masturbate?

16:50.770 --> 16:52.658
No. No.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.473
What did you
mean by it?

16:54.510 --> 16:56.705
That it was _
a pomtless exerCIse.

16:56.740 --> 16:58.207
Strike two.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.048
Maybe... maybe try something
other than sex.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.617
VIOLA:
Had you ever seen this partner?

17:03.650 --> 17:05.515
Howard Lyman? No.

17:05.550 --> 17:08.110
He's the oldest partner. He only
comes in every now and then.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.219
And he sent you an e-mail
about a week ago.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.387
Can you read it?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.257
"Chrissy, I need
to discuss something with you.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.359
"Please come to my office
at 1:00 p.m.,

17:18.400 --> 17:20.231
enter quietly,
and sit down at my desk."

17:20.270 --> 17:21.396
VIOLA:
And you had

17:21.440 --> 17:22.395
no case with him?

17:22.440 --> 17:23.805
That's correct.
And then,

17:23.840 --> 17:26.058
when you got there,
what happened?

17:26.110 --> 17:29.568
He took off his pants and
exposed himself to me.

17:33.780 --> 17:36.613
We have a problem.
Howard Lyman.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.316
PEOPLE (chanting):
...have got to go!

17:40.360 --> 17:41.657
ELI:
Look, I told you.

17:41.690 --> 17:43.555
We're not having the
inaugural at the mansion.

17:43.590 --> 17:45.148
We moved it to
a unIon house.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.623
But you won't call
off the strike?

17:46.660 --> 17:47.729
That's right.

17:47.760 --> 17:48.795
Why not?

17:48.830 --> 17:51.264
Because your guy supported
Scott Walker in Wisconsin.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.460
Oh, come on.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.138
It's a governor
in a nearby state.

17:54.170 --> 17:55.569
He had to show
some support.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.864
Eli, unions in this country
are endangered.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.674
Every time someone comes out
in support of Scott Walker...

18:00.710 --> 18:02.837
So you're going to
protest our inaugural?

18:02.880 --> 18:04.643
That is blackmail.
That is bad faith.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.170
It's not just you, Eli.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.575
We're making a stand
across the Midwest.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.746
Don't take it personally.

18:08.780 --> 18:10.748
You told me it was
about the mansion.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.314
I got Jackie to
back off the mansion,

18:12.350 --> 18:14.113
and now you're
saying...
Jackie Florrick?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.856
What? Yes. Why?

18:16.890 --> 18:19.586
How's she doing?

18:22.260 --> 18:25.593
Jackie? She's fine. Why?

18:25.630 --> 18:27.530
Say hello for me, huh?

18:30.940 --> 18:33.329
ELSBETH:
So, what do we ask him?

18:33.380 --> 18:34.301
Whether he brought
Chrissy here,

18:34.340 --> 18:36.376
and if took his clothes
off in front of her.

18:42.450 --> 18:43.917
Howard?
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

18:43.950 --> 18:46.180
What_? Huh? What
tIme Is It?

18:46.220 --> 18:48.780
1:00.
I don't have a
meeting till 2:00.

18:48.820 --> 18:51.550
You have a meeting now.
We have a problem.

18:51.590 --> 18:52.852
She came in here.

18:52.890 --> 18:55.290
I didn't ask her to,
I didn't invite her in.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.798
But you didn't have your pants
or your underwear on?

18:57.830 --> 18:58.865
I always take it off for lunch.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.595
I take a nap.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.632
I get all sweaty on... on my...

19:03.670 --> 19:05.308
you know, bottom half.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.774
And I did not keep her
from leaving.

19:07.810 --> 19:09.801
Bitch screamed. I was just

19:09.840 --> 19:11.603
offering her some water.
Oh, dear God.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.811
Look, I am the
innocent party here.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.647
The girl came in here
and tried to...

19:15.680 --> 19:17.545
She, uh... she
tried to...

19:17.590 --> 19:19.717
I don't know what
she was trying to do.

19:19.750 --> 19:22.355
I was just taking a nap.

19:25.490 --> 19:26.787
I don't know.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.525
They just got called
into the partner's meeting.

19:29.530 --> 19:32.567
ALICIA:
Damn It.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.966
It might not
be anything.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.831
You need to get
those files.

19:36.870 --> 19:38.861
DIANE:
Alicia?

19:40.740 --> 19:41.832
Diane. How are you?

19:41.880 --> 19:43.745
You know, I just got a glimpse

19:43.780 --> 19:46.772
of what my life would look like
if I'd never started this firm.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.243
And?
Yeah, I liked it.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.474
I liked it a lot.

19:49.520 --> 19:50.885
Shall we?

19:58.960 --> 20:02.851
I understand your frustration,
but it isn't what it seems.

20:02.900 --> 20:04.663
It was a joke.

20:04.700 --> 20:05.860
A prank. That's all.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.539
In what way
was it a joke?
Look, we all

20:08.570 --> 20:11.232
knew Lyman slept off his lunch
without his pants on.

20:11.270 --> 20:13.977
And we'd sent out some e-mails
to some of the paralegals.

20:14.010 --> 20:17.343
CARY:
Not just the women.
It was the men, too.

20:17.380 --> 20:20.440
So you sent this e-mail to
Chrissy from Howard's account?

20:20.480 --> 20:21.879
Yes.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.017
Still haven't negotiated
my exit package yet.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.018
No.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.278
We've negotiated your package.
You just haven't accepted it.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.753
Do you want to talk or not?

20:32.790 --> 20:35.918
Give me my gun
control case,

20:35.960 --> 20:38.565
and let me finish out
the Sonya Rucker contract,

20:38.600 --> 20:40.397
and I will agree to the terms.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.896
You'll keep your clients
in house?

20:41.940 --> 20:42.929
I'll do everything I can.

20:42.970 --> 20:45.461
One more thing.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.978
Indemnify me against this case.

20:48.010 --> 20:49.637
This Howard Lyman thing is BS.
Good.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.739
Then indemnify me.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.919
Sure.

20:53.950 --> 20:55.918
Whatever you want.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.645
Good luck.

21:02.990 --> 21:05.254
Not with a bang.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.390
(typing)

21:39.590 --> 21:41.956
(indistinct chatter)

21:42.000 --> 21:43.991
(typing)

21:46.130 --> 21:49.065
What are you doing?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.032
W-What am I...?

21:50.070 --> 21:51.401
The Sonya Rucker contract.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.407
Excuse me?

21:52.440 --> 21:53.668
You're downloading
my file.

21:53.710 --> 21:54.972
I couldn't
access It.

21:55.010 --> 21:57.376
No, I, um...

21:57.410 --> 21:58.877
I-I think I stumbled...

21:58.910 --> 22:00.616
Alicia, I talked to Will;
it's my case.

22:00.650 --> 22:01.617
There's a_firewall
protectIng It.

22:01.650 --> 22:03.641
Look, my mistake.

22:28.980 --> 22:29.878
McVEIGH:
Hey.

22:29.910 --> 22:30.877
How'd it go?

22:30.910 --> 22:32.707
Oh, I have to stay
a few hours.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.775
Okay, I'll come back.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.947
I want to meet
your friends, Kurt,

22:36.980 --> 22:39.915
your best friends.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.019
Why?
Don't you find it odd

22:41.060 --> 22:44.029
that we've been talking
about marriage

22:44.060 --> 22:46.688
_ and I've never met
a smgle one of your frIends?

22:46.730 --> 22:48.095
No.

22:48.130 --> 22:49.495
Is this about your
friends yesterday?

22:49.530 --> 22:50.497
Do you remember
their names?

22:50.530 --> 22:51.895
No.

22:51.930 --> 22:53.466
Is that important?

22:53.500 --> 22:56.060
I want to meet
your frIends.

23:21.630 --> 23:24.519
ELSBETH:
Uh, before Lockhart/Gardner,
you worked at Hoffman/Ross.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.992
Is that correct?

23:26.030 --> 23:27.065
Yes, why?

23:27.100 --> 23:28.567
And did you ever
make an accusation

23:28.600 --> 23:30.761
against your boss there?

23:30.810 --> 23:32.459
What, is this
a fishing expedition?

23:32.510 --> 23:33.431
It is.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.936
Luckily it's a deposition.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.902
Did you ever make an
accusation against your boss

23:36.940 --> 23:38.043
there, Chrissy?

23:38.080 --> 23:39.479
KALIN DA:
'Cause we have the texts

23:41.480 --> 23:42.549
How very NSA of you.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.582
It's our cell phones,
our property.

23:44.620 --> 23:45.746
Did you ever make
an accusation

23:45.790 --> 23:46.643
against your previous boss?

23:46.690 --> 23:49.511
Not an official accusation.

23:49.560 --> 23:50.584
How about an
unoffICIal one?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.586
He came on to me.

23:52.630 --> 23:53.824
Yes, you accused him

23:53.860 --> 23:56.454
of taking off his clothes
in your presence.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.058
Okay, that is so dirty.
You are trying
I'm just saying,

23:58.100 --> 23:59.567
_to make a connection
It's qUIte a c0InCIdence
that all these

23:59.600 --> 24:01.488
between two completely
unrelated...
bosses want to
take theIr pants off.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.565
So, we got rid
of most of the charges

24:03.610 --> 24:05.009
and we lucked into something

24:05.040 --> 24:07.099
that neutralized
the Howard Lyman threat.

24:07.140 --> 24:08.903
Thank you, Kalinda.

24:08.940 --> 24:12.103
But, uh, we still
have two issues.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.015
Do you mind ifI eat?
I missed lunch.

24:14.050 --> 24:16.814
Please.
Two problems--
well, three.

24:16.850 --> 24:20.718
Chrissy's suggesting that you,
Diane, prostituted her out.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.954
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

24:21.990 --> 24:24.925
And that you, Will,
created a hostile workplace

24:24.960 --> 24:26.985
by sleeping with underlings
in your office.

24:27.030 --> 24:27.849
I can answer that.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.697
DAVID: Have you noticed,
I'm the only one

24:29.730 --> 24:30.924
in the clear here?
ELSBETH:
Now

24:30.970 --> 24:32.926
here comes the third problem.
Kalinda.

24:32.970 --> 24:36.736
I found this saved
onto Howard Lyman's I.T. file.

24:36.770 --> 24:37.998
It's from his laptop.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.508
Hey, why don't you come
over here

24:40.540 --> 24:42.076
and sit on Daddy's lap,
huh, honey?

24:42.110 --> 24:43.873
Oh, dear God.

24:43.910 --> 24:46.071
Who is that?
KALINDA: Another
paralegal-- Lacey Atkins.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.077
Hired last year.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.874
_ This should_have no
Impact on thIs lawswt.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.616
The fact that he approached
another paralegal has

24:52.650 --> 24:54.117
marginal bearing
on this case.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.252
Or you can tell yourselves that.

24:55.290 --> 24:56.109
Thanks, Diane.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.582
DAVID:
So we bury it

24:57.630 --> 24:59.518
and get rid of Howard.

24:59.560 --> 25:02.290
Uh, Will.

25:02.330 --> 25:05.299
I was looking into the partner
decorating stipends.

25:05.330 --> 25:08.697
About a month ago, Alicia
stopped decorating her office.

25:08.740 --> 25:09.934
Did you ask her to stop?

25:09.970 --> 25:11.301
No, why?
I don't know.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.160
I just found it odd.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.638
INSTRUCTOR:
Lift.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.717
Think of the ball
as your grandkids.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.308
There you go.

25:23.350 --> 25:25.181
And up...

25:25.220 --> 25:26.847
I'm sorry, Jackie.

25:26.890 --> 25:28.858
What are you sorry
for, Mr. Gold?

25:28.890 --> 25:29.959
You made yourself
very clear.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.321
Beth, I'll be with
you in a minute.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.157
I'm sorry because I've had
a change of heart.

25:33.190 --> 25:36.057
I find... I need your help.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.124
My help?

25:37.160 --> 25:39.321
No, no, there's
too much chance

25:39.370 --> 25:41.190
of disagreement
between us.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.037
Jackie, I'm apologizing.
And I'm telling you,

25:43.070 --> 25:44.332
you have no reason
to apologize.

25:44.370 --> 25:45.962
You were right
and I was wrong.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.035
INSTRUCTOR:
And what do you say we dance?
So, forward.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.777
Two, three,
and go back.

25:51.810 --> 25:53.710
Really feel it
in the arms.

25:53.750 --> 25:54.717
Okay, what do you want?

25:54.750 --> 25:56.308
Control of the inauguration.

25:56.350 --> 25:58.739
Really?

25:58.790 --> 26:00.189
All right, and...
(sighs)

26:00.220 --> 26:01.289
Control of the ball.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.584
And decorating
of Peter's offices.

26:03.630 --> 26:04.619
INSTRUCTOR:
And forward...

26:04.660 --> 26:05.786
Agreed.
Good.

26:05.830 --> 26:08.298
What kind of assistance
do you need?

26:08.330 --> 26:10.628
You know the Food
Service Union chief?

26:10.670 --> 26:12.228
No, who's that?

26:12.270 --> 26:13.225
Ronald Erickson.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.636
(chuckling):
Oh, yes, Ronnie.

26:15.670 --> 26:16.637
How is he?

26:16.670 --> 26:17.637
This is his number.

26:17.670 --> 26:18.637
Excellent, excellent.

26:18.670 --> 26:19.898
Give him a call.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.100
And one more time.

26:21.140 --> 26:22.107
Forward.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.301
CHRISSY:
I like Diane a lot.

26:24.350 --> 26:27.103
I wanted to be like her.

26:29.720 --> 26:32.609
VIOLA:
And you went to her with
this client's undue attention

26:32.650 --> 26:34.379
because you liked her?
Yes.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.753
I know Mr. Gainsborough is
one of her top clients, but

26:37.790 --> 26:39.052
I told her what he said.

26:39.090 --> 26:41.149
That you looked hot?
Yes, and

26:41.200 --> 26:44.863
that he kept watching me

26:44.900 --> 26:46.891
and asked me my bra size.

26:46.930 --> 26:48.397
And what did
DIane say?

26:48.440 --> 26:50.761
CH RISSY:
She said,

26:50.810 --> 26:52.630
"Don't worry about it.

26:52.670 --> 26:54.399
He meant it as a compliment."

26:54.440 --> 26:56.670
That's when I lost
my respect for her.

26:56.710 --> 26:57.699
VIOLA:
Yes,

26:57.750 --> 27:00.776
I can understand that.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.674
Chrissy never mentioned
she was uncomfortable

27:02.720 --> 27:04.017
with Mr. Gainsborough's comment.

27:04.050 --> 27:05.244
Yes, but she came
to you,

27:05.290 --> 27:08.919
Ms. Lockhart,
and told you what he said?

27:08.960 --> 27:09.915
Yes.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.029
And you told her
to take it

27:11.060 --> 27:13.699
as a compliment
and let it go?

27:13.730 --> 27:15.789
Yes.
Comments
about being hot,

27:15.830 --> 27:19.163
questions about bra size--
these are compliments?

27:19.200 --> 27:21.668
From a gay fashion
designer, they are.

27:26.270 --> 27:30.206
So you're saying
that, um...

27:30.240 --> 27:31.798
(clears throat)
Strike that.

27:32.850 --> 27:34.442
Um,

27:34.480 --> 27:35.970
you didn't know...

27:37.850 --> 27:39.715
Chrissy didn't know
that Mr. Gainsborough was gay,

27:39.750 --> 27:40.717
did she?

27:40.760 --> 27:43.217
I don't know, I thought she did.

27:43.260 --> 27:45.125
She knew he was
a fashion designer.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.320
Really, so now
you're saying

27:46.360 --> 27:49.329
that paralegals
should stereotype

27:49.360 --> 27:51.897
fashion designers or,
or anyone

27:51.930 --> 27:55.696
who they deem to be someone
that might not fit into a...

27:55.740 --> 27:56.764
You're in a hole,

27:56.800 --> 27:58.961
Ms. Walsh, best to stop digging.

28:02.510 --> 28:04.842
$1 million.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.074
(chuckles)

28:06.110 --> 28:08.749
No.
Oh, come on,

28:08.780 --> 28:09.747
it's not going away.

28:09.780 --> 28:10.940
Pay us $1 million and it's over.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.048
Viola,

28:12.090 --> 28:14.957
you're losing,
you're losing badly.

28:14.990 --> 28:16.116
We'll make you this deal.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.481
Stop right now and we
won't countersue you

28:18.530 --> 28:20.418
for filing a
frivolous lawsuit.

28:20.460 --> 28:21.427
We still have you
in your office

28:21.460 --> 28:24.099
conducting sexual
relations with underlings.

28:24.130 --> 28:25.722
Oh, I forgot.

28:25.770 --> 28:26.759
(laughs)

28:26.800 --> 28:27.892
(clears throat)
Here is

28:27.940 --> 28:30.329
an affidavit
from Mr. Gardner

28:30.370 --> 28:32.838
and Tammy Linnata.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.770
They swear they...
(wristband beeps)

28:34.810 --> 28:37.745
...they only had
sexual relations once

28:37.780 --> 28:40.499
in his office, and she
was never in the employ

28:40.550 --> 28:42.108
of Lockhart/
Gardner, so

28:42.150 --> 28:43.515
she was not an underling.

28:43.550 --> 28:46.815
And this is the only time
you've ever had sex

28:46.850 --> 28:48.454
in your office?

28:48.490 --> 28:51.220
It is.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.251
Will.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.767
That wasn't true--

28:58.800 --> 28:59.869
what you just said.

28:59.900 --> 29:00.969
What?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.491
That wasn't the only time
you had sex in your office.

29:06.140 --> 29:08.279
You don't remember?

29:08.310 --> 29:11.541
No, I-I mean, I-I-I-I do,

29:11.580 --> 29:13.844
uh, but it was...

29:15.080 --> 29:17.275
We didn't have sex.

29:17.320 --> 29:21.279
Are, are we defining sex
more restrictively?

29:21.320 --> 29:24.380
Because,
as I remember it...

29:24.430 --> 29:26.921
I don't think we want
that to get out.

29:26.960 --> 29:27.824
I agree,

29:27.860 --> 29:30.397
but your affidavit
could prove problematic

29:30.430 --> 29:32.261
because, at the point
in time we're talking about,

29:32.300 --> 29:33.938
I was an underling.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.835
Hmm.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.531
Wait.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.842
We did it in
there, didn't we?

29:46.180 --> 29:48.569
Technically that's
not my office.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.440
That's my bathroom.

29:50.480 --> 29:54.849
Chrissy did only say
in your office, didn't she?

29:54.890 --> 29:56.118
Yes, sex in my office,

29:56.160 --> 30:00.221
so we didn't have
sex In my ofﬁce.

30:00.260 --> 30:04.162
Good... good.

30:07.070 --> 30:09.561
Thanks.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.794
Thanks.

30:14.010 --> 30:17.229
That was weird, wasn't it?

30:17.280 --> 30:18.907
Talking about two years ago?

30:18.950 --> 30:21.214
Yeah, that'll be on my mind
for the rest of the day.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.582
Just the rest of the day?

30:27.020 --> 30:29.113
(chuckles)

30:29.160 --> 30:31.287
(knocking on door)

30:31.330 --> 30:33.389
Uh, we have
another problem.

30:39.070 --> 30:42.528
Viola wants to open
the Howard Lyman charge again.

30:42.570 --> 30:43.867
HOWARD:
They're crucifying me.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.104
It's like McCarthyism
all over again.

30:45.140 --> 30:46.232
Why, what does she have?

30:46.270 --> 30:49.307
She just
e-mailed it to me.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.649
Hey, why don't you come
over here

30:51.680 --> 30:53.568
and sit on Daddy's lap,
huh, honey?

30:53.610 --> 30:54.577
That's a lie.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.575
Where'd this come from?

30:55.620 --> 30:57.941
You taped it,
you moron.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.116
It's the same one you showed us?

30:59.150 --> 31:01.653
Yes, the one we were going
to keep private.

31:01.690 --> 31:03.351
How did
they get it?
I don't know,

31:03.390 --> 31:04.618
but the worry is,
they did.

31:04.660 --> 31:05.627
WILL:
Someone's feeding them

31:05.660 --> 31:06.627
our dirty laundry?

31:06.660 --> 31:08.355
Yes, now,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.049
the question is who?

31:18.940 --> 31:22.137
So I shouldn't
bring up Obama?

31:22.180 --> 31:24.171
Bring up
anything you want.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.606
Your friends are gonna
hate me, aren't they?

31:27.650 --> 31:30.016
I don't want this
to p0Ison us, Kurt.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.382
Well, let's go then.
We don't need to do this.

31:32.420 --> 31:34.479
No, no, no, no.
Now, I'm-I'm curious.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.579
Let's meet
your frIends.

31:36.620 --> 31:39.259
(indistinct chatter)

31:41.660 --> 31:42.649
Jeannie?

31:42.700 --> 31:45.066
Kurt, there you are.
How you doing?

31:45.100 --> 31:45.896
Hey.

31:45.930 --> 31:48.433
Hi.
JEANNIE:
And this must be Diane.

31:48.470 --> 31:50.631
We're the
fire-breathing crazies.

31:50.670 --> 31:52.638
(laughter)

31:52.670 --> 31:54.638
(quietly):
Hi.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.331
(laughs quietly)

31:57.380 --> 32:01.043
Oh, that went well, hmm?

32:01.080 --> 32:03.071
Yup.

32:04.350 --> 32:06.580
You didn't like 'em?

32:06.620 --> 32:07.518
You mean Jeannie

32:07.550 --> 32:09.689
and Bobbie and Tonya,
the skateboarder?

32:09.720 --> 32:10.948
Why wouldn't I like them?

32:10.990 --> 32:12.321
She's a snowboarder.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.157
And how did you meet them?

32:14.200 --> 32:16.259
In_class.
Oh, In class.

32:16.300 --> 32:20.361
And this class is all women?

32:20.400 --> 32:21.731
You didn't like that
they were women?

32:21.770 --> 32:24.364
No, I'm fine with the fact
that they were all women.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.366
It's just, they were all
in their twenties.

32:26.410 --> 32:29.038
They are all excellent
terminal ballistic experts.

32:29.080 --> 32:33.198
Have you slept with any
of those ballistic experts?

32:41.190 --> 32:43.181
No.

32:46.730 --> 32:48.755
Why are we getting
married, Kurt?

32:48.800 --> 32:51.166
Do you not want to?

32:53.630 --> 32:56.190
I don't know.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.765
MAN:
*_ThIs aIn't
"corporatIons are people" *

32:58.810 --> 33:00.539
* But they don't work...

33:00.570 --> 33:01.468
Ronnie?

33:01.510 --> 33:05.742
* And if you're down
on your luck... *

33:05.780 --> 33:07.441
Mrs. Florrick.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.038
What is this
"Mrs. Florrick?"

33:09.080 --> 33:10.570
That's new.

33:10.620 --> 33:12.315
Jackie. I'm intimidated now.

33:12.350 --> 33:14.284
You're the governor's wife.
Mom, I mean.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.787
I'm still good
old Jackie-o.

33:15.820 --> 33:19.483
Do you remember that time
on Georgie's boat?

33:19.530 --> 33:22.249
Yes, very well. Do you?

33:22.300 --> 33:24.564
We were a lot younger.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.124
We weren't that
much younger.

33:26.170 --> 33:27.728
I've gone grey.

33:27.770 --> 33:29.761
Grey suits you.

33:30.740 --> 33:33.334
Janice will be thrilled
that I ran into you.

33:33.370 --> 33:35.338
Yes.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.678
She wouldn't mind if
I took old Ronnie out

33:37.710 --> 33:39.302
for a drink, would she?

33:39.350 --> 33:42.046
It's been_such
a long tIme.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.816
(elevator bell dings)

33:47.850 --> 33:49.818
You got a problem.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.327
Just one?

33:51.360 --> 33:53.248
Someone in our firm

33:53.290 --> 33:56.350
is feeding evidence to Viola
Walsh so she can attack us.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.391
I've been asked
to find out who.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.159
And?

34:00.200 --> 34:01.792
It's one of your rebels.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.609
How do you know?

34:08.640 --> 34:10.608
Because he left a lot
of fIngerprInts

34:10.640 --> 34:12.198
on an e-mail he sent to Viola.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.309
(sighs)

34:14.350 --> 34:16.341
Kalinda, do me a favor.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.610
I just did you a favor.
Do me another.

34:18.650 --> 34:21.414
I have to tell Will.
I know. Give me
an hour head start.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.587
(sighs)

34:23.620 --> 34:26.282
You have 30 minutes.

34:28.730 --> 34:29.651
What were you
thinking, Tony?

34:29.700 --> 34:31.429
I was thinking what
we were all thinking.

34:31.470 --> 34:32.698
We need clients.
We need...

34:32.730 --> 34:33.719
ALICIA:
You don't sabotage

34:33.770 --> 34:35.863
your own firm.
Lockhart/Gardner

34:35.900 --> 34:37.595
isn't my firm.
Florrick/Agos is.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.335
It's so dumb!
They could sue us!

34:39.370 --> 34:41.531
CARY:
They're gonna fire you
in about ten minutes.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.877
We need you to go along with it.

34:42.910 --> 34:44.707
Don't say anything.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.844
So, I get ﬁred,
I lose my bonus.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.609
I'm out $30,000.

34:49.650 --> 34:50.639
Well, you shouldn't
have gotten caught!

34:50.680 --> 34:52.739
No, we should share
our bonuses. There's no reason

34:52.790 --> 34:54.451
I should suffer
for helping out the whole team.

34:54.490 --> 34:55.752
Oh, helping out
the whole team.

34:55.790 --> 34:56.916
It was your idea
in the first place.

34:56.960 --> 35:00.487
All right, then why should
I stay silent when they fire me?

35:01.900 --> 35:03.356
So you're threatening us?

35:03.400 --> 35:04.662
No, I'm telling you.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.588
We all shared
the start-up costs.

35:06.630 --> 35:08.291
We should share the bonuses.

35:10.270 --> 35:11.567
What do you think?

35:11.610 --> 35:15.307
I think
we've got the mafia here.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.544
We've been moving software
to pay-per-use

35:24.590 --> 35:26.410
and had a massive uptick.

35:26.450 --> 35:28.782
But you know.
You're our lavwer.

35:28.820 --> 35:30.219
So you're happy with the firm?

35:30.260 --> 35:31.386
Lockhart/Gardner?

35:31.430 --> 35:32.681
Yes.

35:32.730 --> 35:37.520
I mean, you're not thinking
of leaving?

35:37.560 --> 35:40.927
Well, I've been hearing rumors
that you're leaving

35:40.970 --> 35:44.804
for a judgeship,
and if that's the case,

35:44.840 --> 35:46.432
we might look around, yeah.

35:46.470 --> 35:48.802
Why?

35:48.840 --> 35:52.606
Has anyone approached you
about joining another firm?

35:52.650 --> 35:54.914
A new firm?

35:54.950 --> 35:56.815
Just the usual calls, you know.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.819
But some of our lavwers
have approached you, right?

36:01.390 --> 36:03.210
I mean, it's all right.
They... they've talked to me.

36:03.260 --> 36:04.659
I don't think

36:04.690 --> 36:07.181
I'm supposed to say anything
until it's official.

36:07.830 --> 36:11.618
No, I understand.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.661
Alicia already told me that, uh,

36:13.700 --> 36:16.533
she's taking you on,
so, I'm fine.

36:16.570 --> 36:17.798
Really?

36:17.840 --> 36:19.808
Because

36:19.840 --> 36:22.274
a firm with the governor's wife
on the letterhead

36:22.310 --> 36:24.346
is hard to pass up.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.288
Diane?

36:31.320 --> 36:33.288
Yes, good.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.459
Did I say something?
No, no.
It's just, um...

36:35.490 --> 36:38.926
I-I have to go.
I'll call you later.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.709
Yes! I don't know
how you did it.

36:51.740 --> 36:53.628
In fact, I don't think
I want to know,

36:53.670 --> 36:54.978
but the union has backed off.

36:55.010 --> 36:56.637
They're not going
to strike the inaugural.

36:56.680 --> 36:59.274
I'm so happy, Eli.
Oh, a little higher.

36:59.310 --> 37:00.402
Higher.

37:00.450 --> 37:01.576
ELI:
So we're

37:01.620 --> 37:04.009
putting Peter
back up again?

37:04.050 --> 37:06.780
Yes. He looks wonderful,
don't you think?

37:06.820 --> 37:08.981
And the seal?

37:09.020 --> 37:10.988
I don't know.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.524
Do you have a suggestion?

37:14.560 --> 37:16.528
No. Wherever you want.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.723
How about in your office?

37:21.670 --> 37:22.932
Oh, congratulations.

37:22.970 --> 37:24.961
Congratulations.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.573
You got stood up, huh?

37:30.940 --> 37:33.408
Not sure yet.

37:35.380 --> 37:37.348
Hey, I got a sister
you can marry.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.813
I'm fine, thanks.

37:46.390 --> 37:47.926
(sighs)

38:01.480 --> 38:03.436
Sorry.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.448
No.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.005
We're good?

38:08.050 --> 38:11.315
Always.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.781
(laughs)

38:18.530 --> 38:21.590
You know we don't
have to do this.

38:21.630 --> 38:23.495
I know.

38:26.530 --> 38:28.498
(man laughs)

38:28.540 --> 38:29.734
(whistles)
Get a room.

38:38.510 --> 38:40.501
(beeping)

38:49.660 --> 38:51.628
and we will forgive
and forget this.
Really?

38:51.660 --> 38:53.355
Well, I wasn't keeping score,

38:53.390 --> 38:55.620
but I thought the last time
I checked, I was ahead.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.719
We just have one more witness.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.534
ELSBETH:
And was it surprising to you

39:01.570 --> 39:04.368
that Chrissy accused
everybody at the firm but you?

39:04.410 --> 39:05.809
No.
It wasn't?

39:05.840 --> 39:06.909
And why is that?

39:06.940 --> 39:08.931
Well, she liked me.

39:08.980 --> 39:11.972
And in what way
did she... like you?

39:12.010 --> 39:13.671
KALINDA:
Uh...

39:13.710 --> 39:15.519
In a lot of ways.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.768
And where did she...
like you most?

39:17.820 --> 39:19.378
In the copy room,

39:19.420 --> 39:21.809
in the pantry,
and sometimes in

39:21.860 --> 39:23.589
the bullpen at night.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.053
ELSBETH:
So, at work?
Yeah.

39:25.090 --> 39:26.580
But Chrissy said
she was offended

39:26.630 --> 39:27.927
by all the sexual
activity at work.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.552
I know. Odd.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.851
Thank you, Kalinda.

39:30.900 --> 39:32.561
Your witness.

39:35.940 --> 39:39.569
Okay, let me talk to my client.

39:39.610 --> 39:40.668
(elevator bell dings)

39:40.710 --> 39:42.871
WOMAN:
Lockhart/Gardner.
How may I direct your call?

39:44.110 --> 39:46.749
Yes. Yes, she is.

39:46.780 --> 39:48.919
30 minutes?

39:51.490 --> 39:53.708
(indistinct,
overlapping chatter)

39:58.790 --> 40:01.588
WOMAN:
I am so sorry I'm late.

40:01.630 --> 40:02.927
Please, my office
is this way.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.120
Missing it already?

40:14.210 --> 40:16.405
(phones ringing,
distant, overlapping chatter)

40:46.640 --> 40:48.608
(door opening)

40:48.640 --> 40:50.608
Oh, I'm sorry.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.699
I thought you had gone.

40:55.180 --> 40:58.047
We're settling with Chrissy.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.082
The compromise.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.682
*

41:42.760 --> 41:44.250
Joely, could you give me
a minute?

41:44.300 --> 41:47.098
Oh, sure. Sure.
I'll be right out here.

41:48.130 --> 41:50.132
Stability.

42:00.750 --> 42:02.217
What?

42:05.250 --> 42:08.617
Alicia's leaving the firm
with Cary,

42:08.660 --> 42:11.652
and she's taking
our top clients.
