00:16.200 --> 00:20.267
(crickets and birds chirping)

00:34.633 --> 00:38.533
- [Narrator] Time
doesn't wait for anybody.

00:38.567 --> 00:41.367
None of us has any time to
waste.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.267
They say time is money

00:49.767 --> 00:54.500
but the things you can
buy with money are cheap.

00:54.533 --> 00:56.333
Time you can pay for,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.067
but you can't buy any.

01:03.833 --> 01:08.167
In spite of all our modern
conveniences and technologies,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.333
everybody tells you they don't
have

01:12.367 --> 01:15.033
time for this or time for that.

01:17.333 --> 01:20.267
Well, of course they don't,

01:20.300 --> 01:24.333
because they lose their
perspective of the present.

01:24.367 --> 01:27.233
The present is just a fleeting
moment.

01:27.267 --> 01:29.600
It comes, and then it's gone,

01:31.067 --> 01:33.667
maybe without even being
noticed.

01:38.733 --> 01:41.400
We think about the past,

01:41.433 --> 01:43.633
and nostalgia makes us sad,

01:45.333 --> 01:47.667
or we worry about the future,

01:48.800 --> 01:52.333
and are too anxious to be in the
present.

01:54.133 --> 01:57.367
The past and the future are just
concepts

01:57.400 --> 01:59.533
that exist in the present.

02:06.133 --> 02:08.032
There's nowhere to go.

02:08.067 --> 02:09.667
Nothing happens next.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.467
You are already here.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.667
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

02:18.800 --> 02:23.133
How do you say cowboy, yeah,
yeah, cowboy.

02:23.167 --> 02:26.233
(lighthearted music)

02:52.400 --> 02:55.200
- [Rob] There's a tough
question.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.067
Your hands numb yet?

02:58.100 --> 03:00.233
- [Craig] Yeah, it's cold.

03:02.567 --> 03:04.500
- [Rob] It's snowing, dude.

03:04.533 --> 03:06.467
Here we go Craig, it's snowing.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.267
- [Craig] Here's the hunt for
Red October.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.267
It's like, how long would your
body last

03:10.300 --> 03:11.533
if you just ran out there in a
Speedo

03:11.567 --> 03:12.800
and a pair of swim fins.

03:12.833 --> 03:15.433
Swam all the way out and back.

03:17.233 --> 03:19.700
(bright music)

03:46.233 --> 03:48.567
(horn honks)

03:56.100 --> 03:58.433
(drum music)

04:18.733 --> 04:20.767
- Um, we came all the way from
warm Hawaii

04:20.800 --> 04:24.467
to come and surf in
freezing cold Scotland.

04:28.100 --> 04:31.167
(men laugh)

04:31.200 --> 04:33.067
- That's the quote of
the trip right there.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.033
- For sure.

04:41.433 --> 04:42.700
I surfed in Alaska once,

04:42.733 --> 04:46.133
but I never remember a thing
like that.

04:52.533 --> 04:53.600
- You know, check in
a couple times a year,

04:53.633 --> 04:55.800
and just think to yourself,
what do you want to do.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.667
- Wait, when did you win
your first world title?

04:57.700 --> 04:58.633
- 92.

04:58.667 --> 05:01.100
- The year I was born.

05:01.133 --> 05:04.400
- Yeah, just a little jump on
you there.

05:09.633 --> 05:12.633
(adventurous music)

06:23.633 --> 06:25.233
- [Albee] I remember what,
being in like my early 20s

06:25.267 --> 06:27.067
and catching waves on backdoor
and pipe

06:27.100 --> 06:28.300
thinking that there's no way in
hell

06:28.333 --> 06:29.733
I'll ever catch a wave better
than that.

06:29.767 --> 06:32.300
The bar's set so high now.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.367
Whether or not I've already
caught

06:33.400 --> 06:36.633
the best wave of my life
is, is the question that--

06:36.667 --> 06:37.733
- [Shane] You don't want to
know.

06:37.767 --> 06:38.667
- [Albee] I don't really
want to know the answer to,

06:38.700 --> 06:41.200
I always want to be asking the
question.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.800
That's the question
I've been asking myself

06:42.833 --> 06:45.133
since I was a little kid.

06:45.167 --> 06:47.633
(bell ringing)

06:51.167 --> 06:53.400
- [Stephanie] I feel like
contests are so natural to me.

06:53.433 --> 06:55.400
I can just show up, go to my
work,

06:55.433 --> 06:57.367
do my thing, and leave,

06:57.400 --> 06:59.500
but knowing that I'm
going on a trip with Dave,

06:59.533 --> 07:01.733
yeah, I'm definitely a
little bit nervous about this

07:01.767 --> 07:05.233
because this is not really my
specialty.

07:06.267 --> 07:08.400
- From my own travels and
meeting people,

07:08.433 --> 07:10.567
it's just purely my own
experience but,

07:10.600 --> 07:13.767
it's that we don't really
acknowledge each other

07:13.800 --> 07:16.100
beyond just that accomplishment.

07:16.133 --> 07:18.500
I feel like, great, you won that
contest,

07:18.533 --> 07:20.767
or great, you surfed this wave.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.200
You don't go, hey, you know
like,

07:22.233 --> 07:23.800
the way you smile when you surf

07:23.833 --> 07:26.433
lights up the whole line, that's
so cool.

07:26.467 --> 07:27.367
Thank you for doing that.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.633
And you're just like, well
that's just me,

07:28.667 --> 07:30.200
I'm just doing that.

07:30.233 --> 07:31.500
- When I look at photos, I'm
like,

07:31.533 --> 07:34.067
why am I smiling all the time?

07:34.100 --> 07:35.567
Instantly, like as soon
as I'm paddling out,

07:35.600 --> 07:37.600
I'm just like, go out, this is
sick.

07:37.633 --> 07:39.500
It's like, yeah.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.367
- I've always wanted to know if
that was

07:41.400 --> 07:43.567
something you think about,
and it just is happening.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.133
- Yeah, it just happens.

07:45.167 --> 07:46.800
(laughs)

07:46.833 --> 07:48.567
- [John] This is the winner
here.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.433
- [Kelly] Here we go, let's go.

07:49.467 --> 07:50.567
- [John] Alright, ready?
- Let's do it.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.433
This is real race.

07:51.467 --> 07:52.300
- Go!

07:52.333 --> 07:53.100
- Go.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.667
- [John] Mine is light and
nimble.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.700
- [Kelly] Yeah, but his legs are
shorter

07:56.733 --> 07:58.200
than Tom Carold.

07:59.167 --> 08:01.033
- What the fuck.

08:01.067 --> 08:03.067
You know what I think?

08:03.100 --> 08:05.133
(laugh)

08:05.167 --> 08:06.167
That's what I think about that
crap.

08:06.200 --> 08:10.200
- That's a full brotherly
tantrum right there.

08:15.167 --> 08:16.300
- [John] I didn't even think
about that,

08:16.333 --> 08:17.000
that we hadn't done a trip
before.

08:17.033 --> 08:18.367
- We haven't done a trip, huh?

08:18.400 --> 08:20.100
We've just like surfed around
and,

08:20.133 --> 08:22.100
well I know we like
the same kind of waves.

08:22.133 --> 08:23.567
- Wait, do you still get
nervous?

08:23.600 --> 08:24.433
- In contests?

08:24.467 --> 08:25.300
- Yeah.

08:25.333 --> 08:26.167
- Sometimes.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.033
Just, if I don't feel confident,
I do.

08:29.067 --> 08:32.067
- [Narrator] There's an
expression in the psychology
world.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.299
If you spot it, you got it.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.567
The judgments you make of others

08:37.600 --> 08:41.067
are quite often reflections of
yourself.

08:44.833 --> 08:47.500
(upbeat music)

08:53.633 --> 08:56.133
- [Kelly] If you get to a
spiritual place within yourself

08:56.167 --> 08:58.333
and you're competing and
that's all connected,

08:58.367 --> 09:02.500
that you're happy for the
other guy when he beats you.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.433
That's a hard place to obtain,

09:06.467 --> 09:09.133
because if you're totally
comfortable with yourself,

09:09.167 --> 09:11.667
which is more important
than winning something,

09:11.700 --> 09:15.500
that you're happy when
the other person wins.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.433
- [Stephanie] It's funny
because I feel like Dave and I

10:47.467 --> 10:50.267
are very similar people in a lot
of ways,

10:50.300 --> 10:54.433
but the paths that we've
taken are so different.

10:54.467 --> 10:55.567
- [Dave] That's a skill I don't
have.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.767
- [Stephanie] But you could
though.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.300
- [Dave] Yeah, if there's
enough incentive in it for me.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.533
- [Stephanie] If you could ride
like tons

11:00.567 --> 11:02.167
of different boards in every
heat.

11:02.200 --> 11:06.333
- [Dave] Yeah, that would,
that would probably help.

11:16.533 --> 11:20.367
You've been on the road for
probably 10 years maybe, yeah?

11:20.400 --> 11:21.533
Nine, 10 years.

11:21.567 --> 11:22.633
- [Stephanie] Yes, this is my
10th year.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.533
- [Dave] And how does that,
does it feel different?

11:24.567 --> 11:27.133
- Yeah, I had a pretty one
track mind for a lot of years,

11:27.167 --> 11:28.700
just like, yeah, let's just surf
and win,

11:28.733 --> 11:30.600
and that's kind of it.

11:41.667 --> 11:44.633
- [Albee] If I could tell
the 10 or 12 year old me

11:44.667 --> 11:47.200
that I was going to get to do
this trip,

11:47.233 --> 11:51.367
just me and Dorian, I would
literally lose my mind.

11:54.833 --> 11:57.067
(both laughing)

11:57.100 --> 11:58.133
That was there.

11:58.167 --> 12:02.100
I was like, you can't get
much better than that.

12:02.833 --> 12:06.033
(children laughing)

12:07.100 --> 12:08.233
- Ow, no, hey.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.767
(bright music)

12:25.633 --> 12:29.100
(grass blade squeaking)

12:33.567 --> 12:35.367
- [Dave] I remember
just being a little guy

12:35.400 --> 12:37.800
and hearing that line, we should
dance

12:37.833 --> 12:41.567
like no one's watching, and
it's just like yeah, totally.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.000
That's just it.

12:44.133 --> 12:46.667
How to surf, how I'm feeling to
surf,

12:46.700 --> 12:49.667
and if things come from that,
awesome,

12:49.700 --> 12:51.633
what a blessing, and if
they don't, whatever.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.433
I'm just having a grove in my
own way,

12:53.467 --> 12:55.200
and that's cool, too.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.300
- [Stephanie] Must be a
pretty good dancer, then,

12:56.333 --> 12:57.267
if you stand by that.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.167
- [Dave] I'm terrible.

13:05.267 --> 13:08.400
- [Craig] Nice to get the waves.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.300
Doesn't always happen.

13:18.567 --> 13:20.133
Did we want to show up on this
trip

13:20.167 --> 13:22.367
and drive around for
three days in the rain

13:22.400 --> 13:25.200
and get completely skunked?

13:25.233 --> 13:28.700
That's now like what we would
plan, right?

13:28.733 --> 13:30.200
- [Rob] I'm fine with it,
though.

13:30.233 --> 13:30.900
- [Craig] And you just roll with
it,

13:30.933 --> 13:32.267
you roll with the punches, like,

13:32.300 --> 13:35.400
you deal with that, and out of
that comes

13:35.433 --> 13:37.633
good things, I'm convinced.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.600
- [John] You have this idea of
like

13:57.633 --> 13:59.733
the ultimate wave of Jaws, you
could be

13:59.767 --> 14:02.467
waiting until you're 30
right now for that chance.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.333
- Yeah, or it could be weeks.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.567
- Or it could be weeks.

14:05.600 --> 14:09.233
And you always have to be ready
for that.

14:09.267 --> 14:12.067
(waves crashing)

14:28.233 --> 14:30.767
(birds calling)

14:42.367 --> 14:43.733
- [John] So dry reef.

14:43.767 --> 14:48.267
- [Kelly] Yeah, like a
foot of water on the reef.

14:48.300 --> 14:51.033
- [John] It's not really a wave.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.200
- You kind of blend the gender
thing, you get rid of it.

14:54.233 --> 14:55.800
It's like, yeah, I've
always thought it was funny,

14:55.833 --> 14:58.733
I mean, there's always the big
complement,

14:58.767 --> 14:59.833
you surf like a guy.

14:59.867 --> 15:04.600
In my head, my most favorite
male surfers to watch

15:04.633 --> 15:06.200
are Joel--

15:06.233 --> 15:07.133
- Surf like women?

15:07.167 --> 15:09.100
- Yourself, Tom Curren.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.533
And to me having that splash of
femininity

15:12.567 --> 15:15.567
is exactly what makes it so
stylish.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.767
It just looks magical.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.267
To me, that's what style is.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.433
(relaxed music)

16:27.233 --> 16:29.167
- Did you ever compete?

16:29.200 --> 16:30.267
- I competed.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.367
Just wasn't built for it.

16:34.700 --> 16:36.633
Have like guys paddling
over me, and I'd be like,

16:36.667 --> 16:40.633
aw, I don't need to
fight you for this wave.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.600
This isn't what it's about.

16:42.633 --> 16:44.633
You go, you can have it.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.200
- If I try and save my queen
right now,

16:49.233 --> 16:53.267
you're going to get me
check in the next move.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.500
- Uh huh, I am.

17:01.133 --> 17:05.133
- I realized I won a few
games on the last move,

17:05.800 --> 17:07.666
and it just put this thing in my
head,

17:07.700 --> 17:08.800
don't ever count yourself out.

17:08.833 --> 17:09.666
- Yeah, you never know.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.567
- You're never out.

17:10.599 --> 17:11.633
You don't know.

17:11.666 --> 17:13.733
You could get, like
surfing, you could get a 10

17:13.767 --> 17:15.233
and a guy gets an interference
and gets in your way,

17:15.267 --> 17:16.532
you won somehow.

17:18.067 --> 17:19.666
- For me, if I was at an event

17:19.700 --> 17:21.099
and I would see a section,

17:21.133 --> 17:22.166
and it was just a beautiful
section

17:22.200 --> 17:25.433
I kind of wanted to admire
more than I wanted to

17:25.467 --> 17:28.166
burn through, I'd just glide
through it.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.533
Aw, this feels amazing.

17:30.567 --> 17:33.400
'Cause I used do that, and
I'd just get destroyed.

17:33.433 --> 17:34.633
4.2, 3.5, five.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.067
- I just love it.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.367
I love, I love like the test of
seeing if

17:41.400 --> 17:43.333
I still have what it takes.

17:43.367 --> 17:46.133
You see yourself like
being interested in it

17:46.167 --> 17:49.333
once you're like in your
30s and closer to 40?

17:49.367 --> 17:50.400
- Yeah.

17:50.433 --> 17:52.100
I think a lot of guys are
out there like antsing,

17:52.133 --> 17:54.200
like, I gotta get it done
right now, this winter.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.767
Like it's El Nino or this is the
swell.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.733
But when you see guys
that have a long career

17:58.767 --> 18:01.233
with so many good waves
over so many years,

18:01.267 --> 18:04.333
it's just like, you can
kind of take your time.

18:04.367 --> 18:05.533
- [Kelly] You have 20 years.

18:05.567 --> 18:06.533
- Yeah.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.433
- What made y'all want
to, was it the process

18:08.467 --> 18:10.300
or the actual end result?

18:10.333 --> 18:13.033
- Um, it was both, it was both,

18:13.067 --> 18:14.600
and there were definitely years

18:14.633 --> 18:16.400
where it was one or the other.

18:16.433 --> 18:18.633
It wasn't always like
both at the same time.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.033
- Yeah.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.100
- I, a lot of time--

18:22.133 --> 18:24.433
- I think for me,
though, like 100 percent,

18:24.467 --> 18:26.600
like looking backwards,
definitely the process

18:26.633 --> 18:28.600
and not the end, like not the
after.

18:28.633 --> 18:29.567
- Yeah.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.333
- I have that feeling like.

18:31.367 --> 18:34.400
- Yeah, I think early on in my
career

18:34.433 --> 18:35.733
it was definitely the process.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.500
I mean, I wanted to win the
world title

18:37.533 --> 18:39.567
in a really bad way, but to me
it was like

18:39.600 --> 18:43.600
I can't get there unless
I get my process right.

18:46.133 --> 18:48.600
(upbeat music)

19:37.667 --> 19:38.800
Or like having pipe to yourself.

19:38.833 --> 19:42.300
- Would you rather have a heat
at firing

19:43.300 --> 19:45.533
Cloudbreak by yourself
or with one other guy,

19:45.567 --> 19:49.700
or have a free surf with
a couple of your friends?

19:54.233 --> 19:57.600
- Yeah, probably free surf, I
guess.

19:57.633 --> 19:59.733
I don't know, 'cause it's also
like,

19:59.767 --> 20:01.400
that's our one stage, you know,

20:01.433 --> 20:06.100
like to kind of show the world
what we have or whatever.

20:06.133 --> 20:07.467
Look it, my guy came back.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.367
He crawled back in from the
ocean.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.667
- Everyone's rushing to become
something,

20:17.700 --> 20:19.800
but it's like no, there's
a natural progression

20:19.833 --> 20:21.733
that you just evolve into who
you are

20:21.767 --> 20:25.400
and it's never going to be
probably what you set out to be.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.600
It could be completely
different,

20:26.633 --> 20:28.533
but you just have to be open to
it.

20:28.567 --> 20:30.533
- I grew up idolizing Tom
Curren.

20:30.567 --> 20:31.467
- Yeah.

20:31.500 --> 20:32.267
- And I was like, I want to surf
like him.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.133
I'd try to hold my arms like
him.

20:33.167 --> 20:35.067
I did these like head snaps and
stuff,

20:35.100 --> 20:38.567
and then I think at some point I
realized

20:38.600 --> 20:39.767
I'm not fucking Tom Curren.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.467
- Exactly.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.700
- I have a different approach,

20:42.733 --> 20:45.800
I have a different foundation
and I think differently.

20:45.833 --> 20:47.567
I'm not the same personality.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.333
- Yeah, different things calm me
down,

20:49.367 --> 20:51.067
different things get you psyched
up.

20:51.100 --> 20:53.433
- But you also have, if you're
trying to be someone else,

20:53.467 --> 20:55.700
if you're not offering
the world what you have

20:55.733 --> 20:57.567
for people to see.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.467
- Yeah.

21:01.567 --> 21:05.700
- [Narrator] His holiness the
14th Dalai Lama was once asked

21:06.700 --> 21:10.133
what surprised him most about
mankind,

21:10.167 --> 21:14.300
and he answered, "Man, because
he sacrifices his health

21:15.233 --> 21:17.633
"in order to make money,

21:17.667 --> 21:22.000
"and then he sacrifices his
money to regain his health.

21:24.733 --> 21:28.200
"He lives as if he's never going
to die,

21:30.133 --> 21:33.600
"and then dies, having
never really lived."

21:37.167 --> 21:39.700
(relaxed music)

25:22.500 --> 25:25.233
(waves lapping)

25:53.467 --> 25:56.600
- [Man] If we actually look
at the state of the world now

25:56.633 --> 25:59.233
and yes, we live in one
of the most peaceful times

25:59.267 --> 26:02.633
between each other in
terms of war and conflict,

26:02.667 --> 26:05.400
we actually live in the most
violent time

26:05.433 --> 26:08.700
between ourselves and the
planet.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.500
Like we're just literally
destroying the place

26:11.533 --> 26:13.267
that looks after us.

26:32.767 --> 26:35.033
The weight?
5?

26:36.067 --> 26:39.167
The dog escaped.
Bella, catch Estrella!

26:44.467 --> 26:47.200
- [Interviewer] What would you
be doing if you didn't surf?

26:47.233 --> 26:48.633
Would you be a fisherman?

26:48.667 --> 26:52.700
- [Craig] I don't like, uh,
blood, yeah.

26:52.733 --> 26:55.200
- I hung out with this chef in
Brazil.

26:55.233 --> 26:57.433
He had this tank, and
there was all these fish

26:57.467 --> 26:59.767
swimming around in it, and
there was a duck sitting on top.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.367
You take the fish out of the
water,

27:02.400 --> 27:04.100
and no one really phases, right?

27:04.133 --> 27:05.367
You see a fish out of the water,
it's like

27:05.400 --> 27:06.767
flopping around, you know, kind
of.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.733
It's like gasping for air.

27:08.767 --> 27:10.200
- Struggling (indistinct).

27:10.233 --> 27:12.433
- And the whole audience
didn't really care.

27:12.467 --> 27:16.033
And then he grabbed the duck,
and stuck it underwater.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.600
And everyone freaked out.

27:18.633 --> 27:19.467
Because--

27:19.500 --> 27:20.367
- Did the exact same--

27:20.400 --> 27:22.433
- And they're like, you're
killing him.

27:22.467 --> 27:24.800
And he's like, well,
what's the difference?

27:24.833 --> 27:27.167
- No difference at all.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.600
- This is getting deep, sorry.

27:30.633 --> 27:35.033
- Who would you rather
be, the duck or the fish?

27:35.067 --> 27:36.300
- [John] Where's the blob?

27:36.333 --> 27:37.433
Should have got that thing out
today.

27:37.467 --> 27:38.733
- [Kelly] Ready?

27:40.767 --> 27:42.433
Oh.

27:42.467 --> 27:46.167
- [John] I feel like that
should have gone farther out.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.733
(bells chiming)

27:52.433 --> 27:54.333
- [Craig] Is that a good wave,
is it a totally shitty wave,

27:54.367 --> 27:56.467
is it rideable, is it
unrideable?

27:56.500 --> 27:57.533
- [Rob] Yeah.

27:57.567 --> 27:58.733
- [Craig] It's the whole
experience of just trying

27:58.767 --> 28:00.267
to like go out there and just
wing it and see if it's--

28:00.300 --> 28:02.500
- [Rob] See if it's a wave.

28:03.733 --> 28:06.467
(cattle mooing)

28:14.467 --> 28:18.600
(children singing in foreign
language)

29:15.667 --> 29:18.633
- [Stephanie] The traveling
is getting better for me

29:18.667 --> 29:22.767
because I'm opening more
up and excited to think

29:22.800 --> 29:25.033
oh cool, I wonder what
is around the corner

29:25.067 --> 29:26.733
that will happen next.

29:28.700 --> 29:33.033
(children singing in foreign
language)

29:48.533 --> 29:51.467
- [Rob] I might have been
your age, a little bit older,

29:51.500 --> 29:55.500
when I was just like,
yeah, sure, let's go.

29:55.533 --> 29:57.367
- [Craig] Where are we going?

29:57.400 --> 29:59.700
- [Rob] Craig's just, are you
the yes man?

29:59.733 --> 30:02.067
- [Craig] Yeah, I just go
along on it for the ride.

30:02.100 --> 30:06.233
- [Rob] He's the yes man,
he's just like yeah, I'm in.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.767
(bright music)

31:52.133 --> 31:53.333
We almost hit.

31:53.367 --> 31:55.200
That was pretty close.

31:55.233 --> 31:58.100
I could see the fear in your
eyes.

32:03.533 --> 32:05.133
- I didn't look at that.

32:05.167 --> 32:06.767
- Oh, that was heavy.

32:12.133 --> 32:15.067
(meditative music)

33:17.467 --> 33:20.300
- [Dave] For me, surfing
actually can be the perfect

33:20.333 --> 33:22.200
type of rite of passage where we
have

33:22.233 --> 33:24.633
these distinct moments
where you're different

33:24.667 --> 33:26.600
after you experience it.

33:26.633 --> 33:30.633
You're like, okay, I'm
going to do this forever.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.467
(bright music)

36:37.067 --> 36:41.200
- [Narrator] Much like our
bodies, our minds love to
wander.

36:49.767 --> 36:53.733
When our thoughts drift,
maybe to something at work,

36:53.767 --> 36:58.100
we fail to notice a set
approaching on the horizon,

37:00.100 --> 37:02.367
or the changing of the tide.

37:16.233 --> 37:18.200
- [Kelly] I think my phone is

37:18.233 --> 37:21.133
the biggest part of stress in my
life.

37:21.167 --> 37:23.133
- [John] Like I'm kind
of addicted to my phone,

37:23.167 --> 37:24.800
but when I get away from it,
it's so nice.

37:24.833 --> 37:26.400
- [Kelly] Yeah, in a way it's
kind of cool

37:26.433 --> 37:28.300
just to let it all go.

37:34.300 --> 37:36.767
(upbeat music)

40:25.600 --> 40:26.700
- I'm getting pretty
good at darts, you guys.

40:26.733 --> 40:28.767
We've been shooting this for a
while.

40:28.800 --> 40:29.800
Come on.

40:29.833 --> 40:31.367
- When you're a kid,
you're just like fuck it,

40:31.400 --> 40:33.767
I'm 18, I have nothing to lose.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.400
And when you get married and
have kids

40:35.433 --> 40:36.433
and that kind of stuff.

40:36.467 --> 40:37.367
- [Albee] Because I don't
know how much longer

40:37.400 --> 40:38.800
I'll feel comfortable on waves
like that.

40:38.833 --> 40:40.300
- Oh, there you go.

40:40.333 --> 40:42.267
- [Albee] Oh, is it in?

41:06.533 --> 41:09.233
- [Shane] If you give a
really good slab surfer

41:09.267 --> 41:12.033
like a blank canvas and said
like

41:12.067 --> 41:16.067
design something that
you really want to surf,

41:16.100 --> 41:18.533
like the optimum slab,

41:18.567 --> 41:19.433
like what would it look like,

41:19.467 --> 41:20.567
what would it look like all
around it,

41:20.600 --> 41:24.400
what would the reef look
like, how would it be shaped?

41:24.433 --> 41:27.400
It's like it was designed by
somebody with a big planer.

41:27.433 --> 41:30.100
Got the cliffs above it
are like a big amphitheater

41:30.133 --> 41:31.567
and there's like these natural

41:31.600 --> 41:34.400
built-in stairs all the way
down.

41:41.333 --> 41:43.667
(grim music)

42:39.567 --> 42:43.433
Some of those waves are
better off left alone.

43:36.300 --> 43:39.433
- [Albee] Holy shit, that was
the one.

43:51.733 --> 43:54.000
On the back, on the back.

43:58.167 --> 44:00.500
Yee-hoo, that was a good one.

44:05.067 --> 44:07.600
(intense music)

44:47.667 --> 44:48.700
It would be radical by yourself,

44:48.733 --> 44:51.033
but it's so much better
to surf (indistinct) dude.

44:51.067 --> 44:52.267
- [Shane] Holy.

45:07.533 --> 45:10.067
(indistinct)

45:22.500 --> 45:23.367
Holy shit.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.133
Well yeah, that was like

45:31.167 --> 45:33.433
as scary as a wave that
big can get, probably.

45:33.467 --> 45:35.233
- [Albee] It's like
almost as scary as Jaws

45:35.267 --> 45:38.200
in the waves were like just
overhead.

45:38.233 --> 45:39.533
- [Man] I think what makes a
good trip is

45:39.567 --> 45:42.233
just the people you hang out
with.

45:42.267 --> 45:44.267
- [Man] Yeah, if you're
going to sit in a car

45:44.300 --> 45:45.567
and drive for 12 hours, you're
not

45:45.600 --> 45:47.200
ripping each other's heads off.

45:47.233 --> 45:49.300
You're laughing about it.

45:50.300 --> 45:54.633
- [Narrator] The message here
is that life is for living.

45:54.667 --> 45:57.500
If you have the intention
to live each moment

45:57.533 --> 46:02.333
to the fullest, even if you
miss a few waves along the way,

46:02.367 --> 46:04.367
you're still doing good.

46:08.800 --> 46:09.800
- Does that count?

46:09.833 --> 46:10.767
- No.

46:10.800 --> 46:12.200
Hundred percent out.

46:12.233 --> 46:15.100
(both laugh)

46:15.133 --> 46:18.533
("Parade" by Kevin Morby)

46:23.400 --> 46:27.533
If you come to find out who you
are

46:29.333 --> 46:33.467
Then may you find out,
may you find out who you are

46:35.767 --> 46:40.100
And if you come to
search for what is lost

46:41.733 --> 46:46.067
Then may you find it,
may you find it at any cost

46:48.633 --> 46:51.233
And if you come

46:51.267 --> 46:54.433
Over from far

46:54.467 --> 46:58.600
May it not touch you,
or ever do you harm

47:01.467 --> 47:03.767
And if you come

47:03.800 --> 47:06.333
Oh so soft

47:07.367 --> 47:11.500
You may look up one
day and you'll be hard

47:17.567 --> 47:21.100
If I were to die today

47:23.800 --> 47:28.067
Slaughtered in that masquerade

47:30.333 --> 47:34.467
The last thing that you'd hear
me say

47:36.667 --> 47:40.200
Put my body on display

47:42.200 --> 47:44.733
In the parade

47:49.667 --> 47:54.000
Passing slowly through the town

47:55.767 --> 48:00.100
My feet, they cannot touch the
ground

48:01.467 --> 48:04.200
Of the parade

48:47.300 --> 48:51.233
All of my friends were there

48:53.600 --> 48:56.333
Waiting on me

48:59.800 --> 49:01.667
All

49:02.833 --> 49:06.333
The glory was there

49:06.367 --> 49:09.100
Waiting on me

49:13.067 --> 49:15.733
And I was there

49:19.133 --> 49:21.667
Waiting on me

49:25.200 --> 49:27.800
I have come

49:27.833 --> 49:31.133
And I will go

49:31.167 --> 49:33.633
Just to stay

49:34.833 --> 49:36.633
In

49:47.767 --> 49:49.333
- [Interviewer] Are you, have
you gotten to a point yet

49:49.367 --> 49:50.467
where you get burnt out?

49:50.500 --> 49:51.633
- Check.

49:51.667 --> 49:52.533
- Oh no.

49:59.700 --> 50:01.600
I haven't, I don't have a finger
up yet.

50:01.633 --> 50:03.067
I got two moves I can do.

50:03.100 --> 50:04.533
I got to practically flip a coin
here.

50:04.567 --> 50:07.433
- Actually that's not a bad
move.
