01:20.461 --> 01:23.225
<i>I remember being really small,</i>

01:27.201 --> 01:29.999
<i>too small
to see over the edge of a table.</i>

01:32.573 --> 01:34.473
<i>There was a snow globe,</i>

01:36.076 --> 01:39.512
<i>and I remember the penguin
who lived inside the globe.</i>

01:43.984 --> 01:47.784
<i>He was all alone in there,
and I worried for him.</i>

01:55.896 --> 01:59.127
Don't worry, kiddo. He has a nice life.

01:59.967 --> 02:02.299
He's trapped in a perfect world.

02:12.546 --> 02:14.411
Look at that, Susie Q.

02:15.115 --> 02:16.514
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:10.170 --> 03:13.264
<i>I remember being given a camera
for my birthday.</i>

03:17.878 --> 03:22.713
<i>I loved the way a photo could capture
a moment before it was gone.</i>

03:26.854 --> 03:29.414
<i>That's what I wanted to be
when I grew up,</i>

03:29.490 --> 03:31.458
<i>a wildlife photographer.</i>

03:34.361 --> 03:35.453
Sorry, Mom!

03:35.529 --> 03:37.360
<i>I imagined that when I was older,</i>

03:37.431 --> 03:41.162
<i>I'd be tracking wild elephants
and rhinos,</i>

03:41.235 --> 03:44.534
<i>but for now,
I'd have to make do with Grace Tarking.</i>

04:01.655 --> 04:04.180
<i>It's strange, the memories you keep.</i>

04:05.659 --> 04:09.823
<i>I remember going with Dad
to the sinkhole out at the Connors' farm.</i>

04:17.137 --> 04:21.471
<i>There was something about the way
the earth could swallow things whole,</i>

04:25.312 --> 04:29.612
<i>and I remember the girl who lived there,
Ruth Connors.</i>

04:31.618 --> 04:34.416
<i>The kids at our school
said she was weird,</i>

04:35.789 --> 04:38.690
<i>but now I know
she saw things others didn't.</i>

04:39.359 --> 04:41.725
We're gonna kick it over on three, okay?
Are you ready?

04:41.795 --> 04:44.491
- All right. One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

04:50.337 --> 04:54.205
<i>And I remember the worst thing
that ever happened to us as a family.</i>

04:54.274 --> 04:56.799
Help! Somebody help!

04:56.877 --> 04:58.208
- Mom?
- Help!

04:59.480 --> 05:02.540
- Where are you? Mom?
- Buckley, please, get up!

05:02.616 --> 05:04.982
- Oh, God. Dad?
- Somebody help! Please!

05:05.052 --> 05:07.179
<i>The day my little brother
stopped breathing.</i>

05:07.254 --> 05:08.915
Buckley!

05:08.989 --> 05:11.150
Buckley! What happened?

05:11.225 --> 05:12.988
He swallowed a twig!

05:28.842 --> 05:30.173
Watch out!

05:31.078 --> 05:32.545
Are you crazy?

05:32.613 --> 05:33.773
Sorry!

06:07.748 --> 06:09.010
Buckley?

06:17.224 --> 06:22.628
Are you okay? You're okay.
Oh, my baby. My baby.

06:22.696 --> 06:27.224
<i>And I remember
the light in my parents' eyes, the relief.</i>

06:27.301 --> 06:29.166
It was my fault. It will not happen again.

06:29.236 --> 06:31.261
<i>We weren't those people,</i>

06:31.338 --> 06:36.037
<i>those unlucky people to whom
bad things happen for no reason.</i>

06:44.685 --> 06:47.552
You know, the Buddhists say
if you save someone else's life...

06:47.621 --> 06:51.079
<i>Grandma Lynn predicted
I would live a long and happy life</i>

06:51.158 --> 06:53.456
<i>because I had saved my brother.</i>

06:54.294 --> 06:57.263
<i>As usual, Grandma Lynn was wrong.</i>

07:01.602 --> 07:04.867
<i>My name is Salmon, like the fish.</i>

07:04.938 --> 07:06.929
<i>First name, Susie.</i>

07:07.007 --> 07:09.999
<i>I was 14 years old
when I was murdered</i>

07:10.077 --> 07:12.978
<i>on December 6, 1973.</i>

07:13.046 --> 07:17.540
<i>And up next, we have Crystal
in a little, bitty, skinny mini!</i>

07:19.720 --> 07:23.315
<i>This was before missing kids
started appearing on milk cartons</i>

07:23.390 --> 07:26.188
<i>or were feature stories
on the daily news.</i>

07:27.494 --> 07:31.453
<i>It was back when people believed
things like that didn't happen.</i>

07:35.168 --> 07:36.931
<i>That's right, ladies.
No matter what the size,</i>

07:37.004 --> 07:40.440
<i>it will hug your girly-girl curves
in all the right places.</i>

07:40.507 --> 07:42.771
<i>- If you got it, why not flaunt it?
- Slow down, buddy!</i>

07:42.843 --> 07:43.867
<i>- Am I right?
- Buckley!</i>

07:43.944 --> 07:45.809
Dad, look, look, look!

07:52.185 --> 07:54.710
There it is! Wow.

08:13.206 --> 08:17.165
Who is he? Does he like you
as much as you like him?

08:17.244 --> 08:19.109
Grandma, he's a senior!

08:21.315 --> 08:23.044
He doesn't know I exist.

08:23.116 --> 08:24.481
He's cute.

08:24.551 --> 08:27.179
Grandma, can we please just drop it?

08:30.590 --> 08:34.616
You're safe now.
He's gone into the record store.

08:37.230 --> 08:38.857
<i>I wasn't safe.</i>

08:39.166 --> 08:42.192
<i>A man in my neighborhood
was watching me.</i>

08:42.269 --> 08:44.236
<i>If I hadn't been so distracted,</i>

08:44.304 --> 08:46.738
<i>I would have realized
something was wrong,</i>

08:46.807 --> 08:49.867
<i>'cause that sort of thing
gives me the skeevies.</i>

08:50.477 --> 08:51.739
<i>But I was too busy</i>

08:51.812 --> 08:55.805
<i>thinking about the length
of Ray Singh's eyelashes.</i>

08:55.882 --> 08:59.113
<i>I had counted each one in library time</i>

08:59.186 --> 09:02.986
<i>while he was reading
Abelard and Heloise,</i>

09:03.056 --> 09:06.719
<i>the most seriously
tragic love story ever.</i>

09:08.762 --> 09:11.424
So, have you kissed him yet?

09:16.002 --> 09:19.529
Why not? You like him, he likes you.
What's the hold-up?

09:21.241 --> 09:24.233
I'm just afraid I won't be any good at it.

09:24.311 --> 09:26.040
My first kiss

09:26.113 --> 09:27.910
was with a grown man.

09:31.118 --> 09:34.554
- You're not gonna tell on me, are you?
- Of course not!

09:35.956 --> 09:38.254
- What was it like?
- The kiss?

09:38.325 --> 09:41.590
Oh, it was wonderful.
Beautiful. Glorious.

09:42.262 --> 09:46.255
It took me a long time
before I realized that a kiss like that,

09:46.333 --> 09:48.130
it only happens once.

09:53.273 --> 09:54.365
Suze...

09:56.643 --> 09:58.372
Just have fun, kid.

10:01.948 --> 10:04.212
<i>It wasn't Mr. O'Dwyer, by the way.</i>

10:04.284 --> 10:07.082
<i>Although, he does look
kind of suspicious.</i>

10:08.021 --> 10:10.489
<i>But Mr. O'Dwyer never hurt anyone.</i>

10:12.592 --> 10:16.858
<i>Mr. O'Dwyer's own daughter
died a year and a half after I did.</i>

10:16.930 --> 10:18.989
<i>She had leukemia,</i>

10:19.065 --> 10:21.226
<i>but I never saw her in my heaven.</i>

10:27.240 --> 10:29.674
- Hey, look at me!
- We'll be right there, honey.

10:29.743 --> 10:30.732
- One second, okay?
- Mom!

10:30.811 --> 10:32.142
Hi, honey.

10:32.879 --> 10:35.507
<i>My murderer was a man
from our neighborhood.</i>

10:35.582 --> 10:37.413
- Thank you so much.
- Careful, honey.

10:37.484 --> 10:41.978
<i>I took his photo once as he talked
to my parents about his border flowers.</i>

10:44.224 --> 10:45.885
- Hey, Mom!
- You really should have a cup of coffee

10:45.959 --> 10:47.483
with us sometime.

10:47.561 --> 10:50.189
<i>I was aiming for the bushes
when he got in the way.</i>

10:50.263 --> 10:51.491
Thanks for the flower.

10:51.565 --> 10:54.557
<i>He stepped out of nowhere
and ruined the shot.</i>

10:56.870 --> 10:58.701
<i>He ruined a lot of things.</i>

10:58.772 --> 11:01.297
What have you
been photographing, honey?

11:01.374 --> 11:03.365
- Everything.
- Everything?

11:18.859 --> 11:20.451
<i>Hey, look at me!</i>

11:27.667 --> 11:28.725
<i>Mom!</i>

11:36.543 --> 11:37.703
<i>Smile!</i>

11:40.714 --> 11:42.443
<i>Mom!</i>

11:44.050 --> 11:45.381
<i>Over here!</i>

11:48.221 --> 11:49.779
<i>Hey, look at me!</i>

11:50.223 --> 11:51.451
<i>Hey, Mom!</i>

11:53.360 --> 11:56.352
<i>Hey, over here! Look!</i>

12:40.707 --> 12:42.334
Okay, here we go.

13:26.353 --> 13:28.378
Clarissa has got a crush on you.

13:29.422 --> 13:31.219
Which one's Clarissa?

13:31.925 --> 13:36.021
You know,
blond hair, megablue eye shadow.

13:36.096 --> 13:38.030
Her dad owns Surf 'n' Turf.

13:38.498 --> 13:40.125
The tall one?

13:40.333 --> 13:42.858
She's not tall. She wears platforms.

13:44.304 --> 13:45.931
She doesn't know you're an accountant.

13:46.006 --> 13:47.530
I take it that's a negative.

13:47.607 --> 13:50.269
Or that you're a closet scale modeler.

13:52.145 --> 13:54.670
Did Mom know before she married you?

13:55.582 --> 13:57.413
About your obsession?

13:57.717 --> 14:01.209
Susie, hobbies are healthy.
They teach you things.

14:01.788 --> 14:03.119
Like what?

14:04.357 --> 14:07.053
Like if you start something, you finish it.

14:07.127 --> 14:08.526
You don't stop until you get it right.

14:08.595 --> 14:10.927
And if you don't get it right,
you start over again

14:10.997 --> 14:13.295
and you keep on going
as long as you have to.

14:13.366 --> 14:17.325
That's the way it is.
That's what you do. It's perfectly normal.

14:18.371 --> 14:21.238
You know, Grampy taught me to do this,
and now I'm teaching you.

14:21.307 --> 14:24.743
We're creating something here,
for us, something special.

14:24.811 --> 14:26.005
I know.

14:26.746 --> 14:28.976
You're my first mate, Susie Q.

14:29.582 --> 14:31.709
One day, all of this will be yours.

14:31.785 --> 14:34.345
Jack! Susie! Dinner!

14:34.421 --> 14:35.911
Wait, wait, wait!

14:36.389 --> 14:37.549
Ready?

14:38.725 --> 14:40.852
- Yeah.
- Now, hold her steady.

14:42.495 --> 14:44.656
Okay, shipmate, take it away!

14:52.338 --> 14:54.568
Now that is a thing of beauty.

14:58.611 --> 14:59.839
Come on.

15:23.970 --> 15:27.770
I don't believe this! Would you look
at the state of this room?

15:30.143 --> 15:32.270
You're gonna clean
this mess up tonight.

15:32.345 --> 15:35.803
Yeah, I will. Hey, Mom,
we need to get these developed.

15:40.487 --> 15:42.717
Susie, you used up all the film?

15:43.356 --> 15:46.450
Do you have any idea
what this is going to cost?

15:48.962 --> 15:53.160
No. No, absolutely not.
Out of the question.

15:53.666 --> 15:56.999
Thanks a lot.
That's my career down the toilet.

15:57.070 --> 15:59.698
- Do not be so melodramatic.
- Honey, what? What's down the toilet?

15:59.773 --> 16:02.571
She's used up all the film
we gave her for her birthday.

16:02.642 --> 16:04.667
- All of it?
- All of it. Every single one.

16:04.744 --> 16:08.009
- Susie!
- It's a crime to be creative in this family.

16:08.081 --> 16:11.812
All right, all right.
Well, say we pay for one roll a month?

16:13.653 --> 16:15.280
One roll a month?

16:16.589 --> 16:20.650
You realize by the time I see my photos,
I'm gonna be middle-aged.

16:21.728 --> 16:24.697
Look, we got her 24 rolls of film, right?

16:24.764 --> 16:28.996
At $2.99 apiece to develop,
that's $71.76.

16:29.068 --> 16:32.060
- I don't think we're being unfair.
- Oh, honey.

16:33.039 --> 16:34.233
Are we?

16:34.307 --> 16:35.968
That's why I love you.

16:36.342 --> 16:37.536
Please.

16:38.178 --> 16:40.408
Could you just not do that at breakfast?

16:40.480 --> 16:42.607
Yes, okay, whatever you say.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.808
Eat your food. Come on.

16:45.885 --> 16:48.911
It doesn't have a siren, you moron.
It's a cement mixer.

16:48.988 --> 16:51.684
Please don't call your brother a moron.

16:52.525 --> 16:55.688
Buddy. No, no, buddy.
Cement stays in the bowl. Please.

16:55.762 --> 16:58.094
It's not cement. It's my oaties!

16:58.164 --> 17:00.689
- Okay.
- School. Let's go.

17:00.767 --> 17:02.530
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye, Susie!

17:02.602 --> 17:03.762
Susie.

17:10.710 --> 17:12.575
What's that?

17:12.645 --> 17:14.839
That's your new hat, sweetie.

17:17.550 --> 17:19.711
Wow, Mom,
I thought you'd given up knitting.

17:19.786 --> 17:23.347
No, I'm still knitting.
You want me to make you one, too?

17:26.759 --> 17:28.454
- Do you have your gloves with you?
- Yes!

17:28.528 --> 17:30.496
Could you put them on, please,
young lady?

17:30.563 --> 17:33.896
Susie! Susie, put your hat on! It's cold.

17:35.235 --> 17:38.796
Holiday, inside!
Holiday, come here! Come here, boy.

17:40.006 --> 17:41.735
Cool-a-roonie, Suze!

17:41.808 --> 17:44.709
- Shut up.
- No, really, it looks good on you.

17:46.279 --> 17:48.770
This is an exercise in humiliation.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.820
- Is she looking?
- Maybe.

18:02.629 --> 18:04.028
Yes, I am.

18:04.764 --> 18:06.322
Hey, come on. We're late.

18:12.805 --> 18:15.069
Next week, bring your homework!

18:15.141 --> 18:18.406
<i>Othello. What is that?
It sounds like a mint.</i>

18:18.478 --> 18:21.242
That guy looked pretty stupid
with black makeup on.

18:21.314 --> 18:24.215
- Who?
- The one with two first names.

18:24.884 --> 18:27.375
- Lawrence Oliver.
- What a loser!

18:27.453 --> 18:29.114
- I know.
- Clarissa.

18:30.156 --> 18:32.488
- Come on. Let's go.
- I'm talking to Susie.

18:32.558 --> 18:35.186
Yeah, and I've been waiting for hours
for your jerk-off film club to finish.

18:35.261 --> 18:36.489
I want to get out of this dump.

18:36.562 --> 18:38.962
It's nice to see you, too, Brian.

18:40.233 --> 18:41.894
You coming or not?

18:42.735 --> 18:44.100
Yeah. Yeah.

18:44.671 --> 18:46.195
I'll see you, Susie.

18:47.106 --> 18:48.505
I heard there was...

18:54.948 --> 18:56.313
Hey, Susie.

19:05.191 --> 19:06.624
Hi, Ray.

19:06.693 --> 19:08.991
<i>What did you think of The Moor?</i>

19:09.696 --> 19:10.754
Who?

19:12.298 --> 19:13.629
<i>Othello.</i>

19:17.236 --> 19:19.067
Well... Well, I just...

19:19.639 --> 19:21.630
It was amazing!

19:21.708 --> 19:25.337
Yeah. I mean, it was really incredible!

19:28.348 --> 19:29.975
I love that play.

19:31.084 --> 19:33.712
That's another thing
we have in common.

19:35.621 --> 19:37.919
What else do we have in common?

19:42.562 --> 19:44.086
Don't you know?

19:51.871 --> 19:52.963
Crap!

19:55.541 --> 19:57.873
- It's okay.
- It's fine. I've got it.

19:58.411 --> 20:01.346
Stupid books. I don't even read them. I...

20:01.414 --> 20:03.382
- Well, I do...
- Susie?

20:03.449 --> 20:05.542
What are you doing on Saturday?

20:21.167 --> 20:23.294
Are you really from England?

20:25.671 --> 20:26.729
Yes.

20:37.950 --> 20:40.282
You are beautiful, Susie Salmon.

20:52.832 --> 20:55.426
- Forget it.
- This is obscene!

20:55.501 --> 20:57.264
Are you listening to me?

20:57.336 --> 20:59.702
There are no breasts
on this anatomy model.

20:59.772 --> 21:02.605
There are no eyes or mouth either,
but we were told to draw in the face.

21:02.675 --> 21:06.008
Well, your unnecessary
anatomical additions

21:06.079 --> 21:08.138
got the Ellis boy thoroughly overexcited.

21:08.214 --> 21:09.272
He stole my drawing.

21:09.348 --> 21:13.614
Yes, and now there are pictures
of naked women all over this school.

21:15.054 --> 21:16.783
Move along, people.

21:17.256 --> 21:20.419
- Sir, can I have my drawing back?
- Certainly not.

21:23.763 --> 21:26.254
Did you hear me, Singh? Go!

21:27.333 --> 21:29.301
Meet me at the mall, 10:00, Saturday.

21:29.368 --> 21:30.665
Now!

21:30.736 --> 21:33.034
- Where in the mall?
- The gazebo.

22:19.719 --> 22:21.949
<i>It's for an Air Force base?</i>

22:22.021 --> 22:24.216
- Hello?
- Dad!

22:25.424 --> 22:27.324
Hey, buddy. No, no, no!

22:28.161 --> 22:30.288
God, you're choking me.
I need some air!

22:41.607 --> 22:43.598
- How was your day?
- Good. Buckley, go wash your hands.

22:43.676 --> 22:44.700
Go ahead, buddy.
We'll play after dinner.

22:44.777 --> 22:45.835
Is Susie with you?

22:45.912 --> 22:47.379
- No.
- She's late.

22:48.881 --> 22:51.509
- Lindsey Lou, where's your sister?
- What?

22:51.584 --> 22:54.109
- Your sister.
- Oh, she had film club.

22:55.721 --> 22:56.745
What's for dinner, hon?

23:30.022 --> 23:31.614
Oh, shoot!

23:34.327 --> 23:36.557
I hope that was your homework.

23:38.664 --> 23:40.894
Oh, hey, you're the Salmon girl, right?

23:41.734 --> 23:42.758
Yeah.

23:42.835 --> 23:44.860
Remember me? You remember me.

23:44.937 --> 23:48.236
I live right down the street,
down in the green house.

23:48.307 --> 23:49.638
Mr. Harvey.

23:50.209 --> 23:52.234
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

23:52.311 --> 23:55.610
- How are your folks doing?
- They're fine.

23:56.082 --> 23:58.414
Good. Tell them I said hi.

23:58.484 --> 24:00.782
You know, you're the perfect person
for me to run into,

24:00.853 --> 24:03.583
because I just built this thing over here
and I want to get a second opinion.

24:03.656 --> 24:05.647
Do you mind taking a look?

24:06.726 --> 24:09.820
Well, actually, Mr. Harvey,
I have to get home.

24:11.831 --> 24:12.923
Okay.

24:18.504 --> 24:20.165
I just worked so hard on it

24:20.239 --> 24:22.799
and I guess I got excited
for someone to see it.

24:22.875 --> 24:24.502
But that's okay.

24:24.577 --> 24:25.839
I'll show the other kids
in the neighborhood.

24:25.911 --> 24:28.141
They're gonna be very excited about it.

24:30.516 --> 24:31.710
Really?

24:32.518 --> 24:35.578
Oh, yeah. It's great.
I mean, it's really neat.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.692
Come on. It'll take two minutes.

24:48.067 --> 24:50.262
You're probably late already.

24:59.812 --> 25:01.404
I don't see anything.

25:02.048 --> 25:03.379
You don't?

25:04.417 --> 25:07.409
You're gonna have to be
more observant, Susie.

25:32.511 --> 25:33.842
What is it?

25:34.180 --> 25:36.546
- I washed my hands!
- Give me five.

25:36.615 --> 25:39.448
Hey, hey, hey, you gotta dry them.
All right.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.550
- Thanks, Mom.
- I'm missing a fork.

25:43.622 --> 25:46.216
- Oh, not beans!
- What?

25:46.292 --> 25:48.317
- Only one.
- One bean?

25:54.767 --> 25:56.394
Pretty neat, huh?

25:58.270 --> 25:59.737
You want a...
You want a pork chop, honey?

25:59.805 --> 26:02.774
- Yes. Thank you.
- Hot, hot!

26:02.842 --> 26:06.039
See? Look at your sister,
great eating habits.

26:06.112 --> 26:07.977
Yeah, but she's older!

26:09.215 --> 26:11.012
- There you go.
- Got it?

26:11.083 --> 26:12.141
Okay.

26:12.718 --> 26:14.310
I built it for the kids in the neighborhood.

26:14.387 --> 26:18.448
I thought they could use it
as kind of a clubhouse, or...

26:18.524 --> 26:19.991
I don't know.

26:20.893 --> 26:23.794
You want to be the first one to try it out?

26:25.631 --> 26:28.293
- Really?
- Yeah, sure, yeah! Go ahead.

26:28.367 --> 26:30.528
It'll be fun. Go ahead.

26:30.870 --> 26:33.236
The corn got into my beans.

26:33.305 --> 26:35.705
If you eat them both,
you can stay up and watch TV with me.

26:35.775 --> 26:37.106
Nah.

26:37.777 --> 26:39.472
I'll make her a plate.

26:40.646 --> 26:42.807
That's it. That's it.

26:50.356 --> 26:51.414
Wow!

27:00.733 --> 27:02.462
Wow, this is neato.

27:08.441 --> 27:10.773
She doesn't like beans,
so I'm not gonna give her any.

27:10.843 --> 27:13.710
Put more. Put more on her plate.
I'm gonna make her eat them all.

27:13.779 --> 27:16.805
- Why doesn't she get to eat beans?
- Okay, okay, I'm gonna give her beans.

27:16.882 --> 27:18.782
- They're really good.
- Watch this.

27:18.851 --> 27:20.682
- That's better.
- Pile them on.

27:20.753 --> 27:23.313
You think Popeye only eats spinach?
There's beans in that can, too.

27:30.029 --> 27:31.894
Make yourself at home.

27:35.134 --> 27:37.864
- This is really cool, Mr. Harvey.
- Yeah, this is cool, huh?

27:37.937 --> 27:40.167
Yeah. I thought that you kids
would like a place of your own

27:40.239 --> 27:42.139
to, you know, hang out.

27:44.944 --> 27:48.209
Here. Have a seat. Go ahead.
There you go.

27:48.981 --> 27:51.211
Sit. You like it?

27:51.283 --> 27:52.682
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

27:59.158 --> 28:01.183
You think she's still at the mall?

28:01.861 --> 28:03.226
- Yeah.
- Really?

28:03.295 --> 28:04.455
She'll be with Clarissa.

28:04.530 --> 28:06.054
She could have at least called.

28:06.131 --> 28:07.723
I mean, a 14-year-old girl knows
how to use a telephone.

28:07.800 --> 28:08.858
Can I please...

28:08.934 --> 28:12.461
I understand. I understand.
I'll deal with her when she gets home.

28:12.538 --> 28:14.904
See, I got all these little things,
like this little...

28:14.974 --> 28:19.206
Little, you know, fluffy animals
and some games,

28:19.278 --> 28:20.802
'cause I know you kids
like to play games.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.347
And then, you know, candles

28:22.414 --> 28:25.076
and, you know, little figurines
like these angels,

28:25.150 --> 28:26.640
I thought were so pretty.

28:26.719 --> 28:28.880
All the figurines have little...

28:32.791 --> 28:36.488
Very sweet. And, you know,
some of these little things.

28:37.963 --> 28:39.430
There you go!

28:40.299 --> 28:43.234
It's nice, with the candles
and everything, right?

28:45.871 --> 28:47.702
And there's one rule.

28:48.474 --> 28:50.635
No adults allowed!

28:57.917 --> 28:59.043
Okay?

29:06.025 --> 29:08.960
That's a cute hat.
I like that hat very much.

29:15.067 --> 29:17.592
Would you like a refreshment, Susie?

29:22.741 --> 29:25.574
- Actually, I have to go.
- No. Be polite.

29:26.445 --> 29:28.310
You have to be polite.

29:29.014 --> 29:32.006
Be polite. That's another rule.

29:48.934 --> 29:50.595
It's warm in here.

29:51.837 --> 29:53.702
I'm warm. Are you warm?

29:55.774 --> 29:58.470
You can take your coat off if you want.

30:13.225 --> 30:15.352
You look very pretty, Susie.

30:16.395 --> 30:17.589
Thanks.

30:21.934 --> 30:23.902
Do you have a boyfriend?

30:30.476 --> 30:34.242
No? I knew it. See, I knew
you weren't like those other girls.

30:34.313 --> 30:36.110
I knew that.

30:36.181 --> 30:37.546
Mr. Harvey?

30:38.484 --> 30:42.614
It's nice down here, isn't it? It's special.
It's special down here, right?

30:42.688 --> 30:46.556
Yes. It is. It's very special.

30:58.671 --> 31:00.161
I have to go.

31:01.607 --> 31:03.632
I don't want you to leave.

31:07.346 --> 31:09.746
I'm not going to hurt you, Susie.

32:05.003 --> 32:08.166
If you see her,
would you please just call? Thank you.

32:09.074 --> 32:11.008
She's not with the Steads.

32:11.543 --> 32:13.204
Where are my keys?

32:14.847 --> 32:16.474
- Where are they?
- I don't know, honey.

32:16.548 --> 32:18.846
In the bowl by the door?
Where are you going?

32:18.917 --> 32:21.385
Jack, could you just wait?

32:21.453 --> 32:23.921
Jack, would you please wait
for the police?

32:23.989 --> 32:25.957
Look, stay by the phone.

32:33.365 --> 32:36.198
Man, she is going to be
in so much trouble.

32:39.905 --> 32:42.533
- Go back to bed, sweetie.
- Okay.

32:46.545 --> 32:48.536
Guys, this is my little girl, Susie.

32:48.614 --> 32:50.548
She hasn't come home from school.
Have you seen her?

32:50.616 --> 32:51.810
- No, I ain't seen nobody.
- No?

32:51.884 --> 32:53.545
- Sorry.
- Ma'am, could you take a look at this?

32:53.619 --> 32:56.087
Have you seen this little girl?

32:56.155 --> 32:57.622
Sorry, buddy.

32:58.757 --> 33:01.624
Can you take a look at this, please?
It's my little girl. She hasn't come home.

33:01.693 --> 33:04.059
- Sorry.
- Just take a look at that.

33:04.963 --> 33:07.397
Ma'am, have you seen this girl?
Please, can you just take a look?

33:20.579 --> 33:24.709
Susan has been missing for, what is it,
four hours now?

33:24.783 --> 33:27.251
Susie. We call her Susie.

33:27.753 --> 33:30.483
Yeah, a little more than four hours.

33:31.089 --> 33:33.182
This the first time she's run away?

33:33.258 --> 33:36.250
She didn't run away.
She's... She's missing.

33:36.328 --> 33:38.125
Any problems at home?

33:40.465 --> 33:42.228
Family difficulties?

33:43.335 --> 33:45.929
No, there really are no problems.

33:46.004 --> 33:49.804
This is a happy... She's a happy child.

33:51.276 --> 33:53.574
- She's never done this, Detective. She...
- I understand that.

33:53.645 --> 33:54.942
- I just have to get a sense of...
- She's not home,

33:55.013 --> 33:56.412
- and she always comes home.
- ...what's going on here.

33:56.481 --> 33:57.470
There's nothing going on.

33:57.549 --> 33:58.538
- She's missing.
- Understood.

34:00.185 --> 34:02.415
- If you see her, please call me, okay?
- Sure thing, Jack.

34:02.487 --> 34:03.954
I'll come back
and see you guys in a little while.

34:04.022 --> 34:05.546
All right. Take care.

34:05.624 --> 34:06.648
Dad?

34:10.128 --> 34:12.221
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt you.

34:12.297 --> 34:14.025
My name's Jack Salmon.
I live right around the corner.

34:14.099 --> 34:15.157
Dad!

34:33.784 --> 34:34.842
Dad!

34:37.389 --> 34:39.857
Can you put together a list
of all her friends

34:39.925 --> 34:42.324
- and their names, contact information...
- Sure.

34:42.393 --> 34:45.022
...and a description
of what she was wearing?

34:45.097 --> 34:47.156
Yes, of course. Well, actually,
I could tell you that right now

34:47.232 --> 34:49.860
if you want to write it down.
She was wearing

34:50.302 --> 34:51.860
a hand-knitted wool hat.

34:59.311 --> 35:01.074
Mom! Dad!

35:05.984 --> 35:07.645
<i>And it has</i>

35:08.487 --> 35:10.478
<i>long, thin tassels.</i>

35:14.126 --> 35:16.617
<i>And she also has...</i>

35:18.230 --> 35:20.391
<i>Well, in fact,
today she didn't wear her scarf.</i>

35:21.066 --> 35:23.193
But she did wear pink gloves,

35:23.268 --> 35:28.433
and she has a beige canvas schoolbag,
and it's got...

35:28.507 --> 35:29.667
Mom?

35:29.741 --> 35:32.676
<i>...rock star buttons pinned to it.</i>

35:35.347 --> 35:38.646
<i>She has Othello inside her bag...</i>

37:47.813 --> 37:49.974
No!

37:53.385 --> 37:56.115
No!

38:07.499 --> 38:09.490
Secure that cordon.

38:09.568 --> 38:11.900
Jesus Christ.
And tape off the rest of the area

38:11.970 --> 38:13.460
before the whole neighborhood
shows up.

38:14.673 --> 38:16.868
Set up the ICP at the school.

38:20.846 --> 38:22.313
What is that?

38:29.521 --> 38:33.150
We found some evidence
in the cornfield behind the school.

38:33.692 --> 38:36.889
There was a cavity in the earth
with a lot of debris,

38:36.962 --> 38:39.453
mostly loose woods and broken crates.

38:39.531 --> 38:42.500
We think it's the remains
of some kind of structure.

38:42.567 --> 38:43.932
And Susie?

38:47.038 --> 38:49.370
We didn't find her, Mrs. Salmon.

38:50.475 --> 38:52.340
That's good, isn't it?

38:52.811 --> 38:54.802
I mean, you found Susie's hat,
but you didn't find her,

38:54.880 --> 38:57.906
which means we really don't even know
if she was there at all. Right?

38:57.983 --> 39:01.441
I mean, that... That... I mean, it's...
It's preferable, right?

39:12.497 --> 39:14.260
We also found blood.

39:18.336 --> 39:20.566
A significant amount of blood.

39:26.711 --> 39:28.235
I'm very sorry.

39:30.081 --> 39:32.515
Hey, we'll get through this.

39:32.584 --> 39:34.814
- How?
- I'm going to take care of you.

39:34.886 --> 39:36.547
- How?
- I'm going to take care of all of us.

39:36.621 --> 39:38.885
- You can't.
- I'll make it right.

39:39.424 --> 39:41.449
You can't make this right, Jack.

39:41.526 --> 39:43.255
- You can't.
- We're going to find her. I promise.

39:43.328 --> 39:45.125
We'll bring her home.

40:27.872 --> 40:29.806
If you see anything
that's out of the ordinary

40:29.874 --> 40:32.741
or anybody that's out of the ordinary,
please don't hesitate to call us.

40:32.811 --> 40:34.711
- Certainly.
- You have my number.

40:34.779 --> 40:37.748
Or you just come by the police station.
Okay? I'll be there.

40:37.816 --> 40:39.681
- Thank you for your time.
- You're welcome.

40:39.751 --> 40:41.844
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

40:48.827 --> 40:50.488
What's that, a Wagoneer?

41:29.534 --> 41:31.195
- Mr. Harvey.
- Yes?

41:31.269 --> 41:33.294
Detective Len Fenerman.

41:33.371 --> 41:34.668
How do you do?

41:34.739 --> 41:36.673
Do you have some time
for a few questions?

41:36.741 --> 41:38.902
- Certainly. Come in.
- Thanks.

41:40.078 --> 41:41.739
I know why you're here, of course.

41:41.813 --> 41:44.407
I think
when something like this happens,

41:44.482 --> 41:46.973
you always blame yourself.

41:47.052 --> 41:49.179
All I can think about now is

41:49.254 --> 41:52.052
why didn't I see something
or why didn't I hear something?

41:52.123 --> 41:54.785
Because... Because surely

41:56.061 --> 41:58.552
that young girl must have screamed.

42:01.433 --> 42:03.765
- Did you want...
- No, no, thanks. I'm fine.

42:03.835 --> 42:04.995
But if you could just think back.

42:05.070 --> 42:08.335
I mean, she was wearing a blue jacket,
yellow corduroys.

42:08.406 --> 42:10.397
Similar clothes to these.

42:12.077 --> 42:14.944
- This blue jacket here?
- The darker blue jacket.

42:15.013 --> 42:17.072
And on the second photograph,
you could see the pants, as well.

42:17.148 --> 42:18.706
Oh, I see. Yeah.

42:19.451 --> 42:21.919
No, it does not ring a bell.

42:21.986 --> 42:24.352
But you were at home that day.

42:24.422 --> 42:26.447
- What day?
- Last Wednesday.

42:26.524 --> 42:28.151
Last Wednesday...

42:46.711 --> 42:49.737
Last Wednesday...
No, I was home all day.

42:50.315 --> 42:51.782
I mean, I probably went out

42:51.850 --> 42:55.581
and ran a few errands
or something like that, but, I mean...

42:56.654 --> 42:59.953
I should have been here all day,
for the most part.

43:00.024 --> 43:01.719
Okay. Good.

43:01.793 --> 43:03.556
- All righty.
- Thanks.

43:04.829 --> 43:07.696
- You married?
- I was, yeah.

43:07.766 --> 43:09.529
But you have kids.

43:09.601 --> 43:12.468
No, I wish. I wish. But no.

43:13.371 --> 43:15.669
- You mind if I take a look?
- No.

43:18.843 --> 43:21.073
I make everything myself.

43:21.146 --> 43:22.272
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. All this.

43:22.347 --> 43:26.681
I turn all the banisters myself and make
all the shingles and the furniture.

43:26.751 --> 43:28.309
And I used to do cabinet making,

43:28.386 --> 43:30.479
but there's not much call
for that these days.

43:30.555 --> 43:32.216
Maybe I spend too much time
on these things,

43:32.290 --> 43:35.259
but it's the perfectionist in me, I guess.

43:35.326 --> 43:37.260
- Well, it shows.
- Thank you.

43:37.328 --> 43:40.024
- That's amazing craftsmanship.
- Oh, well...

43:40.565 --> 43:43.398
I took a risk and tried something new
and discovered a talent

43:43.468 --> 43:45.459
that I didn't know I had.

43:56.314 --> 43:58.305
What's that underneath the stairs?

43:59.284 --> 44:01.377
That would be the basement.

44:09.861 --> 44:10.919
Dad?

44:13.765 --> 44:15.630
She's dead, isn't she?

44:32.217 --> 44:33.980
<i>I was slipping away.</i>

44:35.687 --> 44:37.678
<i>That's what it felt like.</i>

44:39.757 --> 44:41.554
<i>Life was leaving me.</i>

44:47.232 --> 44:48.995
<i>But I wasn't afraid.</i>

44:53.338 --> 44:54.999
<i>Then I remembered,</i>

44:56.741 --> 44:59.369
<i>there was something I was meant to do,</i>

45:01.145 --> 45:03.272
<i>somewhere I was meant to be.</i>

45:20.999 --> 45:22.057
Ray?

45:38.116 --> 45:39.174
Ray!

45:44.989 --> 45:46.047
Ray!

46:59.230 --> 47:01.664
Ray! Wait!

47:10.541 --> 47:12.532
Ray!

49:08.426 --> 49:11.418
<i>"If I had but an hour of love</i>

49:11.496 --> 49:13.987
<i>"If that be all is given me</i>

49:15.500 --> 49:18.492
<i>"An hour of love upon this earth"</i>

49:20.404 --> 49:22.702
<i>"I would give my love to thee</i>

49:24.208 --> 49:25.573
<i>"The Moor."</i>

49:56.941 --> 49:58.568
Are you the Moor?

49:59.777 --> 50:00.835
Why?

50:09.554 --> 50:11.681
I think this belongs to you.

50:19.697 --> 50:21.597
Where did you get this?

50:22.500 --> 50:23.831
I found it.

50:30.975 --> 50:33.876
I write poetry. You're quite good.

50:36.914 --> 50:39.212
Don't you have somewhere to go?

50:40.651 --> 50:42.619
You miss her, don't you?

50:45.823 --> 50:48.018
I never knew what dead meant.

50:49.093 --> 50:52.585
I used to think it meant lost. Frozen.

50:53.598 --> 50:55.088
It means gone.

50:56.601 --> 50:57.932
She's gone.

51:01.272 --> 51:02.933
What if she isn't?

51:06.944 --> 51:08.935
What if she's still here?

51:18.823 --> 51:21.724
- You're not supposed to do that.
- What?

51:23.361 --> 51:26.558
- Who are you?
- She saw you, that girl.

51:26.631 --> 51:28.724
I think my hand touched hers.

51:28.799 --> 51:30.528
Yes, that's all it takes.

51:30.601 --> 51:33.297
She carry you now
for the rest of her life.

51:33.371 --> 51:37.330
You're not supposed to look back.
You're supposed to keep going.

51:37.975 --> 51:39.840
Hey! Come back!

51:39.911 --> 51:42.175
Wait! Who are you?

51:42.246 --> 51:45.238
I'm Holly. Holly Golightly.

51:45.316 --> 51:48.285
- That doesn't sound like a real name.
- It isn't.

51:48.352 --> 51:51.116
I borrowed it. You can do that up here.

51:51.188 --> 51:53.315
Up here? You mean in heaven.

51:55.793 --> 51:58.193
- You're funny.
- What's funny about it?

51:58.262 --> 52:00.628
This isn't heaven. You're not there yet.

52:02.099 --> 52:04.033
What is this place?

52:04.101 --> 52:08.538
This place is not really one place
and also is not the other place.

52:10.608 --> 52:12.269
It's bits of both!

52:19.183 --> 52:21.913
- What is that?
- That's where we're going.

52:23.721 --> 52:26.713
<i>Holly said there was a wide,
wide heaven</i>

52:26.791 --> 52:28.816
<i>beyond everything we knew,</i>

52:32.029 --> 52:34.224
<i>where there was no cornfield,</i>

52:34.832 --> 52:36.163
<i>no memory,</i>

52:37.201 --> 52:38.463
<i>no grave.</i>

52:42.239 --> 52:44.571
<i>But I wasn't looking beyond yet.</i>

52:46.410 --> 52:48.401
<i>I was still looking back.</i>

52:57.655 --> 52:59.316
<i>You can't go back.</i>

53:02.660 --> 53:04.059
Who are you?

53:05.663 --> 53:08.223
It's over. Come with me.

53:08.766 --> 53:10.393
I don't know you.

53:11.535 --> 53:13.503
Why are you here?

53:13.571 --> 53:16.165
You need to let go of Earth.

53:16.240 --> 53:19.107
You're dead, Susie. You have to leave.

53:22.046 --> 53:23.638
I have to go home.

54:17.134 --> 54:18.192
Dad!

55:22.333 --> 55:25.166
<i>My murderer began to feel safe.</i>

55:26.203 --> 55:28.933
<i>He knew people wanted to move on.</i>

55:29.006 --> 55:30.871
<i>They needed to forget.</i>

55:31.775 --> 55:34.369
<i>He took comfort in the thought.</i>

55:34.445 --> 55:36.470
<i>No one was looking at him.</i>

55:46.357 --> 55:50.589
<i>But there was one thing
my murderer didn't understand.</i>

55:52.796 --> 55:57.790
<i>He didn't understand
how much a father could love his child.</i>

56:34.838 --> 56:36.100
Dad!

57:09.974 --> 57:11.305
It's okay.

57:12.710 --> 57:14.575
It's going to be okay.

57:15.446 --> 57:19.439
He knows I'm here.
My dad knows I'm here.

57:21.785 --> 57:23.582
<i>I was still with him.</i>

57:27.758 --> 57:29.385
<i>I wasn't lost,</i>

57:29.460 --> 57:32.020
<i>or frozen or gone.</i>

57:32.796 --> 57:34.195
<i>I was alive.</i>

57:35.199 --> 57:39.135
<i>I was alive in my own perfect world.</i>

58:53.977 --> 58:55.035
Dad?

58:56.513 --> 58:57.946
I saw Susie.

59:01.952 --> 59:03.817
She came into my room.

59:05.389 --> 59:07.789
She kissed me on the cheek.

59:07.858 --> 59:09.485
Come here, buddy.

59:13.697 --> 59:15.221
I saw her, too.

59:16.567 --> 59:17.932
- Dad?
- Yeah?

59:18.902 --> 59:20.665
I think she listens.

59:35.052 --> 59:37.714
<i>She's used up all the film
we gave her for her birthday.</i>

59:37.788 --> 59:39.085
<i>All of it?</i>

59:39.156 --> 59:42.319
<i>It's a crime to be creative in this family.</i>

59:42.393 --> 59:44.884
<i>Say we pay for one roll a month?</i>

59:44.962 --> 59:46.122
<i>One roll a month?</i>

59:51.402 --> 59:52.733
I got them.

59:53.570 --> 59:56.198
Look at these. Some of these are good.

59:58.909 --> 01:00:01.104
Honey, why don't you get them
all developed?

01:00:01.178 --> 01:00:04.238
- This one roll a month thing is...
- This must be one of her artistic shots.

01:00:04.314 --> 01:00:07.010
- ...really crazy, honey. It's crazy.
- Why?

01:00:07.084 --> 01:00:10.315
I mean, why do we wanna
keep this thing dragging out like this?

01:00:10.387 --> 01:00:13.550
We're not dragging it out.
We made a deal.

01:00:13.624 --> 01:00:15.524
There is no deal, Jack.

01:00:31.742 --> 01:00:33.573
- Fenerman...
- Len, I had to call you.

01:00:33.644 --> 01:00:36.613
<i>Look, Susie is a smart kid.
She would never go off with a stranger.</i>

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.615
<i>It had to be someone she knew,
somebody local.</i>

01:00:39.683 --> 01:00:41.844
...I'd play with it all the time.

01:00:42.119 --> 01:00:44.883
<i>Look, I've got a name for you,
I've got several names, actually.</i>

01:00:44.955 --> 01:00:46.946
<i>- Ronald Driver.
- Do you have an address?</i>

01:00:48.192 --> 01:00:52.492
<i>Len, I've got another name for you.
He's a janitor. Michael Gitchell.</i>

01:00:53.697 --> 01:00:57.098
<i>There's something wrong with this one,
I'm telling you. Gary Davis.</i>

01:00:57.167 --> 01:00:58.259
<i>- Who's that?
- Davis.</i>

01:00:58.335 --> 01:00:59.734
He works in the sanitation department.

01:00:59.803 --> 01:01:01.202
<i>Okay, I'll look into it, Jack.</i>

01:01:01.271 --> 01:01:02.863
<i>- I'll look into it.
- But I have his address right here.</i>

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.170
Is it a bad thing if I just drop by there
and take a look myself?

01:01:07.611 --> 01:01:08.635
<i>- Fenerman.
- Have you checked on</i>

01:01:08.712 --> 01:01:10.373
<i>- Frank Peretti yet?
- Who?</i>

01:01:10.447 --> 01:01:12.506
<i>Peretti. P-E-R-E-T-T-I.</i>

01:01:12.583 --> 01:01:14.517
<i>I have his credit report, Len.
It does not look good.</i>

01:01:14.585 --> 01:01:16.177
<i>I'm on top of it. You understand?</i>

01:01:16.253 --> 01:01:19.654
<i>- Len, I found another one.
- Jack, listen, you got to trust me, okay?</i>

01:01:19.723 --> 01:01:21.850
<i>We're gonna get this guy.</i>

01:01:23.994 --> 01:01:26.462
Len! Glad you're here.
I was just going to call you.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:27.861
Yeah. I got your messages.

01:01:27.931 --> 01:01:29.421
I've been at the Public Records Office
all day.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:31.127
Got a lot of stuff to go over here.

01:01:31.435 --> 01:01:33.562
I know you're looking
at the obvious suspects,

01:01:33.637 --> 01:01:36.435
convicted felons, child molesters.
And I understand why,

01:01:36.507 --> 01:01:39.408
but, Len, I think you're coming at it
from the wrong angle.

01:01:39.476 --> 01:01:42.172
- Honey...
- Herman Stolfuz just across the street.

01:01:42.246 --> 01:01:45.579
Now, he appears to be perfectly normal,
but, Len,

01:01:45.649 --> 01:01:48.618
- the man wears adult diapers.
- Herman is 80 years old.

01:01:48.685 --> 01:01:52.143
I followed him in the supermarket.
His shopping cart was filled with them.

01:01:52.222 --> 01:01:54.156
- He has a prostate problem.
- My point is,

01:01:54.224 --> 01:01:56.055
we need to start working backwards.

01:01:56.126 --> 01:01:59.789
Start looking at family histories,
criminal records, mental health issues.

01:01:59.863 --> 01:02:01.057
I've been doing a lot of reading
on this subject.

01:02:01.131 --> 01:02:02.155
Jack, this doesn't change anything.

01:02:02.232 --> 01:02:05.929
Did I mention taxes? Len, you can tell
a lot about a person from taxes.

01:02:06.003 --> 01:02:08.904
Please, will you just stop it now?
Will you just stop?

01:02:08.972 --> 01:02:11.202
Can't you just leave it alone?

01:02:14.311 --> 01:02:16.905
Jack, I know it's been 11 months.

01:02:17.281 --> 01:02:20.580
I know you've been trying
to deal with this in your own way,

01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:24.943
but she's not coping very well.
She needs help, Jack.

01:02:26.490 --> 01:02:29.550
She needs someone
to help her get through this.

01:02:35.365 --> 01:02:38.732
Grandma's here!
Grandma! Grandma's here!

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:42.329
What's my mother doing here?

01:02:42.406 --> 01:02:43.998
Look, you're not coping, okay?

01:02:44.074 --> 01:02:46.736
Len's worried. I'm worried.
Your mother offered to help.

01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:48.675
You invited her here?

01:02:48.745 --> 01:02:51.339
- Darling!
- Hello, Mother.

01:02:51.415 --> 01:02:52.939
- Watch the hair, sweetheart.
- Sorry.

01:02:53.016 --> 01:02:56.076
- Look at you. Are you eating?
- Is this all of it?

01:02:56.153 --> 01:02:58.519
Don't be ridiculous.
That's just my makeup.

01:02:58.589 --> 01:03:01.114
You are still handsome as hell, Jack.

01:03:01.592 --> 01:03:04.083
Lindsey, honey,
aren't you going to say hello?

01:03:04.161 --> 01:03:06.789
- The child hates me.
- Come here, buddy.

01:03:06.863 --> 01:03:09.195
So, what'll it be, Jack?

01:03:09.866 --> 01:03:11.834
Actually, I'm not drinking these days.

01:03:11.902 --> 01:03:13.802
Well, that's your problem in a nutshell.

01:03:16.373 --> 01:03:17.738
Are we still a family?

01:03:17.808 --> 01:03:19.400
Of course we're a family.

01:03:19.476 --> 01:03:22.036
Your mother's in crisis,
your father's a wreck.

01:03:22.112 --> 01:03:24.080
What does that make you?

01:03:26.183 --> 01:03:27.912
I'm in charge.

01:04:46.396 --> 01:04:48.660
...through the woods,
looking for fuzzwalker.

01:04:49.633 --> 01:04:54.002
Then he sees three. And he takes
his gun and looks and aims.

01:04:54.071 --> 01:04:55.868
And then, a giant puff of smoke!

01:04:55.939 --> 01:04:59.204
He doesn't see them anymore.
Then he realizes that was his gun.

01:04:59.276 --> 01:05:01.676
It was out of bullets! Then he runs.

01:05:01.745 --> 01:05:03.872
Runs, runs, runs, runs, runs!

01:05:03.947 --> 01:05:05.209
Till he runs in the forest,

01:05:05.282 --> 01:05:08.911
but then he realizes
he came without his fuzzwalker.

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:27.998
Holiday!

01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:41.141
All right! Okay!

01:05:49.159 --> 01:05:51.286
You're a Salmon girl, right?

01:05:55.866 --> 01:05:56.958
Okay.

01:05:58.668 --> 01:05:59.760
Okay.

01:06:05.475 --> 01:06:06.703
Holiday.

01:06:16.052 --> 01:06:17.280
Grandma?

01:06:18.488 --> 01:06:20.353
I know where Susie is.

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:23.921
Yeah, Susie's gone
to heaven, sweetheart.

01:06:23.994 --> 01:06:26.485
Lindsey said there is no heaven.

01:06:26.563 --> 01:06:28.656
All right, then, she's dead.

01:06:30.467 --> 01:06:32.458
You might be dead soon.

01:06:32.536 --> 01:06:35.334
- Why do you say that?
- Because you're old.

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.939
Thirty-five is not old.

01:06:38.008 --> 01:06:41.068
You've been sniffing
too much of that nail polish.

01:06:41.144 --> 01:06:43.408
And, anyway,
nothing is going to happen to me.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.947
You know why?

01:06:46.616 --> 01:06:49.710
Because I take my medicine every day.

01:06:52.122 --> 01:06:53.453
Grandma,

01:06:55.158 --> 01:06:56.989
she's here.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.527
- What?
- Susie.

01:06:59.896 --> 01:07:01.887
Susie's in the in-between.

01:07:17.814 --> 01:07:21.614
<i>I was in the blue horizon,
between heaven and Earth.</i>

01:07:23.086 --> 01:07:25.077
<i>The days were unchanging,</i>

01:07:26.356 --> 01:07:30.190
<i>and every night,
I dreamed the same dream.</i>

01:07:32.696 --> 01:07:34.664
<i>The smell of damp earth.</i>

01:07:35.498 --> 01:07:37.693
<i>The scream that no one heard.</i>

01:07:39.502 --> 01:07:44.098
<i>The sound of my heart beating,
like a hammer against cloth.</i>

01:07:48.044 --> 01:07:50.274
<i>And I would hear them calling,</i>

01:07:51.214 --> 01:07:53.614
<i>the voices of the dead.</i>

01:07:56.586 --> 01:07:58.554
<i>I wanted to follow them,</i>

01:07:58.622 --> 01:08:00.283
<i>to find a way out,</i>

01:08:01.791 --> 01:08:05.124
<i>but I would always come back
to the same door.</i>

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:09.157
<i>And I was afraid.</i>

01:08:12.836 --> 01:08:15.304
<i>I knew if I went in there,</i>

01:08:17.173 --> 01:08:19.073
<i>I would never come out.</i>

01:08:25.916 --> 01:08:29.443
<i>My murderer could live in one moment
for a long time.</i>

01:08:30.854 --> 01:08:35.188
<i>He could feed off a memory
over and over again.</i>

01:08:37.294 --> 01:08:40.354
<i>He was animal. Faceless.</i>

01:08:41.231 --> 01:08:42.390
<i>Infinite.</i>

01:08:44.267 --> 01:08:46.667
<i>But then he would feel it,</i>

01:08:46.736 --> 01:08:48.703
<i>the emptiness returning,</i>

01:08:49.738 --> 01:08:52.332
<i>and the need would rise in him again.</i>

01:09:00.684 --> 01:09:01.707
Go! Go!

01:09:01.785 --> 01:09:03.184
- In here?
- A detour. Go.

01:09:03.252 --> 01:09:04.515
<i>When summer came,</i>

01:09:04.587 --> 01:09:08.045
<i>he noticed young lovers
would sneak into the cornfield.</i>

01:09:08.692 --> 01:09:11.160
<i>He began to follow them</i>

01:09:11.227 --> 01:09:12.558
<i>and watch.</i>

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:31.276
Will you come to bed?

01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:34.410
Yeah. Soon.

01:09:55.377 --> 01:09:56.708
Buckley did this, right?

01:09:56.778 --> 01:10:02.148
Correct. He said that this is our house,
this is the police station and that's you.

01:10:02.217 --> 01:10:03.206
That's me?

01:10:03.285 --> 01:10:05.310
Yeah.
He made you Chief of Police, so...

01:10:05.387 --> 01:10:06.786
I've gained 20 pounds.

01:10:06.855 --> 01:10:10.416
- It must be the uniform.
- It's the dangers of a desk job.

01:10:11.126 --> 01:10:13.594
I'd like to report a lost purse.

01:10:14.329 --> 01:10:16.354
Why don't you have a seat?

01:10:24.606 --> 01:10:26.801
- I'm living with this every day.
- What about your marriage?

01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:28.240
- What marriage?
- You just don't give up!

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:30.278
- Jack is sleeping in his study!
- He's trying.

01:10:30.345 --> 01:10:32.142
You have to find a way to keep going.

01:10:32.213 --> 01:10:33.407
- Mother...
- You don't have a choice.

01:10:33.481 --> 01:10:36.746
- I am coping with this.
- You can't give up. You have to...

01:10:36.818 --> 01:10:37.944
- Oh, no, Mother.
- Bingo!

01:10:38.019 --> 01:10:39.179
That is cooking sherry!

01:10:39.254 --> 01:10:41.848
- Please! Please!
- You have to find a way to live with this.

01:10:41.923 --> 01:10:44.687
- Live with it? I am living with this!
- You're not!

01:10:44.759 --> 01:10:46.886
- I'm dealing... I'm coping...
- You don't go into Susie's room.

01:10:46.962 --> 01:10:49.362
- I'm dealing with it! So what?
- You won't let anybody touch her things!

01:10:49.431 --> 01:10:52.332
You have a tomb
in the middle of your house!

01:10:54.302 --> 01:10:56.793
Sweetheart, do you really think
if you seal it up

01:10:56.871 --> 01:10:59.271
that the pain's going to go away?

01:12:03.838 --> 01:12:06.671
<i>My mother went as far away
as she could.</i>

01:12:06.741 --> 01:12:10.939
<i>She found a job in a small orchard
outside of Santa Rosa.</i>

01:12:11.012 --> 01:12:13.913
<i>The work was hard, but she didn't mind.</i>

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:19.481
<i>If anyone asked,
she said she had two children.</i>

01:12:35.837 --> 01:12:37.236
<i>And Lindsey,</i>

01:12:38.106 --> 01:12:40.904
<i>who always said
she didn't believe in love,</i>

01:12:42.544 --> 01:12:44.136
<i>found it anyway.</i>

01:13:07.469 --> 01:13:08.993
<i>And there it was.</i>

01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:11.801
<i>The moment I would never have.</i>

01:13:13.908 --> 01:13:16.376
<i>My little sister had run ahead of me.</i>

01:13:18.046 --> 01:13:19.775
<i>She was growing up.</i>

01:13:24.319 --> 01:13:27.220
What's the matter?
I thought you'd be happy.

01:13:28.123 --> 01:13:29.488
I am happy.

01:13:33.661 --> 01:13:35.185
I'm very happy.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:37.798
Then why are you crying?

01:13:39.167 --> 01:13:41.362
No. You think she did not want
to kiss him?

01:13:41.436 --> 01:13:42.460
No.

01:13:43.872 --> 01:13:45.100
She did.

01:13:47.108 --> 01:13:49.508
She wanted to kiss him very much.

01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:05.418
<i>Always, I would watch Ray.</i>

01:14:06.728 --> 01:14:08.855
<i>I was in the air around him.</i>

01:14:10.031 --> 01:14:14.058
<i>I was in the cold winter mornings
he spent with Ruth Connors,</i>

01:14:15.203 --> 01:14:18.036
<i>that strange, otherworldly girl</i>

01:14:18.106 --> 01:14:23.100
<i>who so easily accepted the presence
of the dead among the living.</i>

01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:31.576
<i>And sometimes, Ray would think of me.</i>

01:14:33.721 --> 01:14:36.212
<i>But he began to wonder,</i>

01:14:36.291 --> 01:14:39.124
<i>maybe it was time
to put that memory away.</i>

01:14:41.296 --> 01:14:43.594
<i>Maybe it was time to let me go.</i>

01:14:50.405 --> 01:14:51.895
What was that?

01:14:51.973 --> 01:14:54.601
- I'm sorry.
- What was... What was that?

01:15:03.818 --> 01:15:05.479
Lindsey, throw it!

01:15:50.531 --> 01:15:53.466
<i>My murderer had finely tuned instincts.</i>

01:15:54.402 --> 01:15:56.666
<i>He knew my sister had begun to wonder</i>

01:15:56.738 --> 01:16:00.230
<i>about the solitary man
who lived in the green house.</i>

01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:04.744
<i>She seemed intent on crowding him,</i>

01:16:06.147 --> 01:16:07.876
<i>and he resented it.</i>

01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:30.702
<i>He began to feel a familiar itch.</i>

01:17:30.665 --> 01:17:32.724
- Mom, look!
- Just a second.

01:17:43.244 --> 01:17:44.370
Careful, honey.

01:17:45.446 --> 01:17:46.538
Mom!

01:17:54.122 --> 01:17:56.955
<i>Pretty, aren't they?
They are so beautiful.</i>

01:19:21.342 --> 01:19:22.673
Mom, look!

01:19:24.245 --> 01:19:25.735
Hey, Dad, look at me!

01:20:42.089 --> 01:20:43.613
Mr. Salmon.

01:20:43.691 --> 01:20:44.715
Hi.

01:20:48.462 --> 01:20:49.929
What is that?

01:20:52.099 --> 01:20:54.465
It's just a project I'm working on.

01:20:54.535 --> 01:20:56.867
- You're a hunter?
- Ducks.

01:20:59.874 --> 01:21:02.001
- That's a blind, right?
- Yep.

01:21:02.944 --> 01:21:05.640
- So those things really work?
- Oh, yeah.

01:21:08.115 --> 01:21:11.710
It's all about concealment,
the art of concealment,

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.315
and patience.

01:21:14.388 --> 01:21:18.290
It takes a lot of patience.
I sit for hours on end in the dark.

01:21:19.193 --> 01:21:20.820
I'm an outdoorsman.

01:21:21.329 --> 01:21:22.956
Always have been.

01:21:46.153 --> 01:21:47.518
Mr. Salmon?

01:21:51.492 --> 01:21:53.289
I just...

01:21:53.361 --> 01:21:57.320
I never got a chance to tell you
how sorry I am about your loss.

01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:24.418
<i>Dad.</i>

01:22:45.146 --> 01:22:48.013
Here. Let me. Let me help you.

01:22:48.082 --> 01:22:49.777
Oh, no. That's all right.
Really, I can manage.

01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:51.613
No, it's no trouble.

01:22:54.522 --> 01:22:55.853
All right.

01:22:56.490 --> 01:22:57.980
Appreciate it.

01:23:02.997 --> 01:23:04.294
This is for you.

01:23:04.365 --> 01:23:07.232
Oh, thank you, Mr. Harvey,
you really shouldn't.

01:23:08.169 --> 01:23:09.500
- You're welcome.
- Oh, that does smell...

01:23:09.570 --> 01:23:10.832
It's a beautiful smell, isn't it?

01:23:12.873 --> 01:23:15.569
- Hey, look at me!
- Careful, honey.

01:23:23.517 --> 01:23:27.419
Oh, that really does smell delicious.

01:23:28.255 --> 01:23:30.120
- Beautiful, yeah.
- Dad!

01:23:30.191 --> 01:23:32.853
They are something.

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.157
Hey, Dad, look at me!

01:24:01.956 --> 01:24:05.323
I think it's time for you to go home now,
Mr. Salmon.

01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:18.035
Go on home.

01:24:25.246 --> 01:24:26.577
I'm sorry.

01:24:28.182 --> 01:24:29.809
I can't help you.

01:24:31.519 --> 01:24:35.319
What did you do to her?
What did you do to my daughter?

01:24:35.389 --> 01:24:37.289
Tell me! Where is she?

01:24:38.526 --> 01:24:39.993
It's got to stop, Jack!

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.426
You came this close
to getting arrested tonight!

01:24:42.496 --> 01:24:45.124
You're lucky George Harvey declined
to press charges.

01:24:45.199 --> 01:24:46.757
Lucky?

01:24:46.834 --> 01:24:48.961
Your father put a hole
in the man's back door.

01:24:49.036 --> 01:24:50.765
Yeah, he should have put a hole
in his head.

01:24:50.838 --> 01:24:52.806
- Lindsey, please.
- Did you hear that, Jack?

01:24:52.873 --> 01:24:54.773
This is the example you're setting
for your kids?

01:24:54.842 --> 01:24:55.934
Persecuting the neighbors!

01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:57.841
- He's not crazy!
- I didn't say that.

01:24:57.912 --> 01:25:01.871
- Well, then why won't you listen to him?
- Because you need evidence, Lindsey.

01:25:01.949 --> 01:25:05.385
You can't go around making
accusations against George Harvey

01:25:05.452 --> 01:25:08.387
when you have no evidence.
You need proof.

01:25:08.455 --> 01:25:10.548
You are pathetic.

01:25:10.624 --> 01:25:12.114
Why can't you just admit it?

01:25:12.193 --> 01:25:14.855
You stopped looking for her
a long time ago.

01:25:14.929 --> 01:25:16.328
Len's right.

01:25:17.364 --> 01:25:19.229
He's right.

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.427
It's time to put this behind us.

01:25:21.502 --> 01:25:23.367
It's gone on too long.

01:25:23.804 --> 01:25:25.431
This has to stop.

01:25:25.906 --> 01:25:27.237
Dad...

01:25:27.308 --> 01:25:29.833
Things will take
their natural course, Lindsey.

01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:34.472
Len, I appreciate everything you've done.
You've been a great friend to me.

01:25:38.118 --> 01:25:40.211
That goes for Abigail, too.

01:25:40.921 --> 01:25:43.719
You've been a great friend to both of us.

01:26:28.369 --> 01:26:30.394
<i>Murder changes everything.</i>

01:26:40.948 --> 01:26:44.247
<i>When I was alive, I never hated anyone.</i>

01:26:45.486 --> 01:26:48.455
<i>But now, hate was all that I had.</i>

01:26:49.223 --> 01:26:50.815
I want him dead.

01:26:52.393 --> 01:26:57.330
I want him cold and dead
with no blood in his veins!

01:27:02.403 --> 01:27:03.768
Look at me.

01:27:05.406 --> 01:27:07.431
Look at what he did to me!

01:27:08.642 --> 01:27:10.200
What am I now?

01:27:10.277 --> 01:27:14.714
The dead girl?
The lost girl? The missing girl?

01:27:15.449 --> 01:27:16.848
I'm nothing!

01:27:49.149 --> 01:27:50.616
I was stupid.

01:27:53.253 --> 01:27:55.118
I was so stupid!

01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:56.747
You don't control this, Susie.

01:28:13.307 --> 01:28:15.070
He does not own you.

01:28:17.077 --> 01:28:20.911
You can be free of him, but not this way.

01:28:20.981 --> 01:28:24.473
What do you know?
You don't know anything.

01:28:24.551 --> 01:28:26.610
That man took my life!

01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:33.918
You will see, Susie.
In the end, you will understand.

01:28:36.764 --> 01:28:38.322
Everybody dies.

01:29:02.256 --> 01:29:03.917
- Brian!
- Just a little further in. Keep going.

01:29:03.991 --> 01:29:06.186
- Keep going.
- Okay, okay, I'm coming!

01:29:20.474 --> 01:29:21.532
Dad?

01:29:22.810 --> 01:29:23.868
Dad!

01:29:25.279 --> 01:29:27.747
Dad! Dad!

01:29:27.815 --> 01:29:31.581
<i>I realized what I had done.
I willed him to stop.</i>

01:29:39.393 --> 01:29:41.418
<i>I willed him to turn back.</i>

01:29:48.302 --> 01:29:49.894
I know it's you!

01:29:50.537 --> 01:29:51.799
Come out!

01:29:52.606 --> 01:29:54.403
Come out and face me!

01:29:55.342 --> 01:29:57.867
Did you hear me, you son of a bitch?

01:30:03.484 --> 01:30:04.849
Get off me!

01:30:05.552 --> 01:30:07.042
You sick fuck!

01:30:09.456 --> 01:30:12.619
Brian, stop! Please, stop!

01:30:14.628 --> 01:30:17.756
Brian, stop! Brian, stop it!

01:30:17.831 --> 01:30:19.856
You want to touch my girl?

01:30:22.069 --> 01:30:23.093
Dad!

01:30:25.906 --> 01:30:26.998
Dad!

01:30:31.612 --> 01:30:32.670
No.

01:30:32.746 --> 01:30:34.145
Brian, stop!

01:30:38.385 --> 01:30:40.319
Brian, stop! Stop!

01:30:41.955 --> 01:30:44.480
Don't you get it? You've killed him!

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.052
- He's dead!
- Go.

01:30:48.128 --> 01:30:50.028
- He's dead!
- Go! Go!

01:32:19.219 --> 01:32:22.655
<i>I knew then he would never give me up.</i>

01:32:24.458 --> 01:32:27.450
<i>He would never count me
as one of the dead.</i>

01:32:30.497 --> 01:32:32.226
<i>I was his daughter.</i>

01:32:33.967 --> 01:32:35.628
<i>And he was my dad.</i>

01:32:37.204 --> 01:32:40.537
<i>And he had loved me
as much as he could.</i>

01:32:43.477 --> 01:32:45.240
<i>I had to let him go.</i>

01:34:18.505 --> 01:34:23.101
<i>Sophie Cichetti. Pennsylvania. 1960.</i>

01:34:24.244 --> 01:34:26.269
<i>She had been his landlady.</i>

01:34:49.903 --> 01:34:53.896
<i>Jackie Meyer. Delaware. 1967.</i>

01:34:54.541 --> 01:34:56.771
<i>She had just turned 13.</i>

01:34:56.843 --> 01:35:01.041
<i>Her body was found in a drainage ditch,
by the side of the road.</i>

01:35:06.453 --> 01:35:10.184
<i>Leah Fox. Delaware. 1969.</i>

01:35:11.224 --> 01:35:14.853
<i>She was already dead
when he dumped her body in the river.</i>

01:35:26.473 --> 01:35:32.241
<i>Lana Johnson. 1960.
Bucks County, Pennsylvania.</i>

01:35:32.312 --> 01:35:36.180
<i>She was lured into a shack
he had built out of old doors.</i>

01:35:36.917 --> 01:35:39.784
<i>She was the youngest. She was six.</i>

01:35:53.433 --> 01:35:57.597
<i>Flora Hernandez. Delaware. 1963.</i>

01:35:58.405 --> 01:36:01.932
<i>He'd only wanted to touch her.
But she screamed.</i>

01:36:13.587 --> 01:36:17.614
<i>Denise Lee Ang. Connecticut. 1971.</i>

01:36:18.291 --> 01:36:23.024
<i>Thirteen. She was waiting for her father
to close up their shop</i>

01:36:23.096 --> 01:36:24.654
<i>when she vanished.</i>

01:36:24.731 --> 01:36:28.895
<i>Denise Lee Ang,
who sometimes liked to be called</i>

01:36:29.803 --> 01:36:30.963
<i>Holly.</i>

01:37:57.390 --> 01:38:03.954
<i>Susie Salmon. 14.
Norristown, Pennsylvania. 1973.</i>

01:38:05.265 --> 01:38:08.996
<i>Murdered in a room
he had built under the earth.</i>

01:38:48.608 --> 01:38:51.668
Come on, guys, keep up.
Move over to the right!

01:39:06.359 --> 01:39:07.724
- You okay, Lindsey?
- You go on.

01:39:07.794 --> 01:39:09.421
- You sure?
- I'm fine. Go.

01:39:09.496 --> 01:39:10.793
Catch up?

01:46:31.871 --> 01:46:32.929
Dad!

01:46:34.474 --> 01:46:35.873
Where's Dad?

01:46:45.985 --> 01:46:47.043
Mom.

01:46:53.893 --> 01:46:57.590
- What are you doing here?
- What does it matter? She's home.

01:46:58.364 --> 01:47:00.025
Home for good?

01:47:00.099 --> 01:47:02.329
Of course she's home for good.

01:47:03.236 --> 01:47:05.363
- Where's Buckley?
- He's at soccer practice,

01:47:05.438 --> 01:47:08.032
and I have to pick him up in an hour.

01:47:40.606 --> 01:47:41.834
My girl.

01:47:43.209 --> 01:47:44.301
Jack.

01:48:10.336 --> 01:48:11.735
Look at you.

01:48:13.039 --> 01:48:14.529
What happened?

01:48:23.983 --> 01:48:26.076
This is a crime scene. Tape it all off.

01:48:44.437 --> 01:48:47.099
No, no, no, no. You're too late.

01:48:48.241 --> 01:48:50.209
We're closed.

01:48:50.276 --> 01:48:52.073
- You're closed?
- Yeah.

01:48:53.646 --> 01:48:56.706
That's too bad. I was really hoping
I'd get rid of this thing.

01:48:56.782 --> 01:48:59.080
Sorry, pal. I'm filling her in.

01:49:00.086 --> 01:49:02.213
- You're filling her in?
- Yep.

01:49:02.288 --> 01:49:06.884
Oh, yeah. Well,
I really hate to inconvenience you, but...

01:49:12.598 --> 01:49:16.125
- Would you like some help?
- Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

01:50:24.704 --> 01:50:26.899
I come here almost every day.

01:50:30.209 --> 01:50:32.507
I like to listen to the sounds.

01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:35.943
Have you seen Holly?

01:50:36.949 --> 01:50:39.383
Did she tell you about this place?

01:50:40.786 --> 01:50:41.844
Yes.

01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:46.290
Then you must be ready.

01:50:47.326 --> 01:50:49.089
I'm Flora Hernandez.

01:50:51.230 --> 01:50:53.425
The others will be here soon.

01:51:02.842 --> 01:51:04.104
Who's that?

01:51:04.176 --> 01:51:07.077
I don't know,
but he gives me the skeevies.

01:51:07.146 --> 01:51:09.444
The skeevies? What are you, 12?

01:53:07.166 --> 01:53:08.690
It's beautiful.

01:53:11.036 --> 01:53:13.027
Of course it's beautiful.

01:53:14.406 --> 01:53:15.805
It's heaven!

01:53:39.064 --> 01:53:42.090
All right, come on. Let's go. I got to...

01:53:48.641 --> 01:53:51.269
What are you waiting for? You're free!

01:53:58.183 --> 01:53:59.377
Almost.

01:54:01.220 --> 01:54:02.551
Not quite.

01:54:13.732 --> 01:54:14.790
Ray!

01:54:22.675 --> 01:54:23.733
Ray!

01:54:53.639 --> 01:54:54.731
Ruth!

01:54:56.275 --> 01:54:57.765
What happened?

01:55:02.381 --> 01:55:03.439
Hey.

01:55:06.785 --> 01:55:08.252
What's wrong?

01:55:15.894 --> 01:55:16.986
Ruth?

01:55:39.752 --> 01:55:40.912
Susie?

01:55:45.090 --> 01:55:47.422
You wrote me a poem once.

01:55:50.763 --> 01:55:52.958
You called yourself the Moor.

01:56:02.608 --> 01:56:05.668
That's good. I got it. I'll take it from here.

01:56:19.224 --> 01:56:20.748
Kiss me.

01:57:27.025 --> 01:57:29.516
You are beautiful, Susie Salmon.

01:57:51.216 --> 01:57:56.153
<i>These were the lovely bones
that had grown around my absence.</i>

01:57:57.890 --> 01:58:01.417
<i>The connections, sometimes tenuous,</i>

01:58:03.228 --> 01:58:05.526
<i>sometimes made at great cost,</i>

01:58:06.865 --> 01:58:09.265
<i>but often magnificent</i>

01:58:11.670 --> 01:58:14.366
<i>that happened after I was gone.</i>

01:58:17.142 --> 01:58:19.542
<i>And I began to see things in a way</i>

01:58:20.512 --> 01:58:22.537
<i>that let me hold the world</i>

01:58:24.283 --> 01:58:25.910
<i>without me in it.</i>

01:58:44.469 --> 01:58:46.437
It's a cold one tonight!

01:58:53.612 --> 01:58:55.512
You looking for a ride?

01:58:57.549 --> 01:58:58.607
No.

01:58:59.952 --> 01:59:00.976
No?

01:59:03.155 --> 01:59:05.646
Are you sure? Pretty cold out here.

01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:11.088
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

01:59:13.131 --> 01:59:14.496
What do you think?

01:59:14.566 --> 01:59:17.967
Look, mister, I'm not interested, okay?

01:59:19.071 --> 01:59:22.563
I'm not trying to do nothing.
Just trying to be polite.

01:59:22.641 --> 01:59:24.006
That's all.

01:59:25.043 --> 01:59:28.911
- A young lady alone at night, not safe.
- Didn't you hear me?

01:59:28.981 --> 01:59:30.243
Piss off!

02:00:28.707 --> 02:00:31.540
<i>When my mother came to my room,</i>

02:00:31.610 --> 02:00:36.240
<i>I realized that all this time
I had been waiting for her.</i>

02:00:38.450 --> 02:00:40.577
<i>I had been waiting so long.</i>

02:00:42.154 --> 02:00:44.452
<i>I was afraid she wouldn't come.</i>

02:00:48.226 --> 02:00:49.887
I love you, Susie.

02:01:01.573 --> 02:01:04.201
<i>Nobody notices when we leave.</i>

02:01:04.276 --> 02:01:07.871
<i>I mean, the moment
when we really choose to go.</i>

02:01:09.147 --> 02:01:14.141
<i>At best, you might feel a whisper
or the wave of a whisper</i>

02:01:14.753 --> 02:01:16.345
<i>undulating down.</i>

02:01:19.091 --> 02:01:22.151
<i>My name is Salmon, like the fish.</i>

02:01:23.328 --> 02:01:24.989
<i>First name, Susie.</i>

02:01:26.264 --> 02:01:29.290
<i>I was 14 years old
when I was murdered</i>

02:01:29.368 --> 02:01:32.633
<i>on December 6, 1973.</i>

02:01:37.175 --> 02:01:39.075
<i>I was here for a moment,</i>

02:01:41.313 --> 02:01:43.076
<i>and then I was gone.</i>

02:01:45.784 --> 02:01:49.345
<i>I wish you all a long and happy life.</i>
