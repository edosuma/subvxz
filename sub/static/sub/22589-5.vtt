<i>NARRATOR". A calm afternoon on the floor
of the Gotham City Stock Exchange.</i>

00:18.478 --> 00:20.897
<i>And in boardrooms throughout the country.</i>

00:22.315 --> 00:23.566
<i>But what's this?</i>

00:23.775 --> 00:26.611
This can't be happening. I'm wiped out.

00:26.819 --> 00:28.363
I made a fortune today.

00:28.571 --> 00:32.700
My only problem now is whether to buy
amalgamated or consolidated.

00:32.909 --> 00:35.411
Cortland, you're the president of the
exchange, what do you make of this?

00:35.620 --> 00:39.332
I don't know. I've never seen
anything like it before.

00:54.681 --> 00:59.644
<i>And while it's true the stock exchange
has had some wild days in the past...</i>

00:59.978 --> 01:05.233
<i>...never in its history has there been
anything comparable to this day.</i>

01:05.441 --> 01:10.071
<i>It began shortly after 2:00.
At that time...</i>

01:12.031 --> 01:13.658
<i>Good afternoon, my friends.</i>

01:17.245 --> 01:18.496
Where did he come from?

01:18.997 --> 01:20.665
Who is that?

01:21.207 --> 01:26.129
<i>A helpful Minstrel I
When I see folks in trouble</i>

01:26.462 --> 01:28.548
<i>Then I come on the double</i>

01:29.007 --> 01:31.843
<i>With counsel both soothing and wise</i>

01:32.051 --> 01:35.430
<i>With counsel both soothing and wise</i>

01:36.014 --> 01:40.476
Ooh. Isn't he attractive? So gentlemanly.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.521
<i>For fair remuneration</i>

01:43.730 --> 01:47.275
<i>I'll wipe the tears from your eyes</i>

01:47.483 --> 01:52.280
<i>I'll wipe the tears from your eyes</i>

01:52.697 --> 01:55.199
- Is he talking to us?
-Apparently.

01:55.617 --> 01:59.037
<i>This message is for
members of the Gotham City Stock Exchange.</i>

01:59.245 --> 02:01.789
<i>Gentlemen, salvation is available.</i>

02:02.248 --> 02:05.126
<i>The Minstrel's Friendly Stock Brokers
Protective Association...</i>

02:05.335 --> 02:09.505
<i>...would guarantee you immunity
from a repetition of today's calamity.</i>

02:09.964 --> 02:11.507
How thoughtful.

02:11.716 --> 02:17.013
<i>I'm sure you'll agree the fee is reasonable
for the protection provided.</i>

02:18.056 --> 02:21.309
<i>$1000 per week per stock exchange member.</i>

02:21.643 --> 02:22.769
That's blackmail.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.897
<i>Make your checks payable
to account number 007...</i>

02:26.105 --> 02:30.652
<i>...and airmail them each week to the
Broccoli Bank in Geneva, Switzerland.</i>

02:30.860 --> 02:35.615
<i>I'll expect notice of your agreement to this
in tomorrow's Gotham City Times.</i>

02:35.823 --> 02:40.828
<i>Let me emphasize that 100 percent participation
is essential.</i>

02:41.079 --> 02:44.666
- That's a quarter of a million dollars.
-We'll fight him. Call a TV station.

02:44.874 --> 02:47.835
TV station, nonsense.
I'm calling Commissioner Gordon.

02:51.464 --> 02:54.008
What are you gonna do, commissioner?

02:54.634 --> 02:56.969
There's only one thing we can do.

03:01.057 --> 03:03.059
Commissioner Gordon.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.312
Yes, indeed.

03:07.105 --> 03:09.691
I have the same thought.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.819
But who was that?

03:13.111 --> 03:18.116
That was Mr. Brook Cortland.
President of the Gotham City Stock Exchange.

03:33.756 --> 03:36.551
I shall alert him to your call, sir.

03:37.719 --> 03:40.221
-It's the--
-I suspected.

03:41.055 --> 03:46.018
We were watching, Commissioner Gordon.
We'll be right there. To the Batpoles.

04:55.129 --> 04:58.007
Atomic batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.

04:58.216 --> 04:59.509
Ready to move out.

05:34.502 --> 05:38.089
A minstrel who is also an electronic genius.

05:38.297 --> 05:41.175
- What a strange combination.
-Not at all, commissioner.

05:41.384 --> 05:44.762
Music and electronic energy
are both transmitted by waves.

05:44.971 --> 05:47.932
Which obey almost identical laws of nature.

05:48.140 --> 05:52.854
A logical pursuit for a musician
with a twisted criminal mind.

05:53.062 --> 05:56.107
Of course, Batman, you are right.
I wouldn't have thought of that.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.358
Commissioner.

05:57.567 --> 06:00.278
- Oh, Mr. Cortland.
- Commissioner.

06:00.486 --> 06:03.906
Batman, this is Mr. Cortland.
President of the Gotham City Stock Exchange.

06:04.115 --> 06:05.157
Glad to know you.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.911
I think we have a mutual friend,
that upstanding philanthropist Bruce Wayne.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.247
Yes, I've heard him mention your name.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.249
And of course, Robin, the Boy Wonder.

06:13.457 --> 06:14.834
- How do you do?
-How do you do?

06:15.042 --> 06:16.711
What happened here this afternoon?

06:16.919 --> 06:20.423
The quotations going out over the Trans-Lux
went completely wild.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.968
Some high, some low, but none right.

06:24.176 --> 06:29.056
Orders started pouring in at the false prices
and it was, well, it was just a disaster.

06:30.141 --> 06:32.935
Do all the quotations go out
over a single transmitter?

06:33.144 --> 06:35.938
- Yes.
- Hm. We better check that installation.

06:36.272 --> 06:38.399
Who is this Minstrel?
Where did he come from?

06:38.608 --> 06:40.151
How did he get on the TV program?

06:40.359 --> 06:42.820
The station has no explanation at all.

06:43.029 --> 06:45.990
Apparently, he simply overrode the signal
from the studio...

06:46.198 --> 06:48.159
...to the transmitter with a stronger one.

06:48.367 --> 06:51.245
I don't know anything about this man
but I intend to know more about him...

06:51.454 --> 06:52.580
...before we're through.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.958
Would you show us the transmission room
in the exchange building?

06:56.250 --> 07:00.338
Of course. Could your secretary place
a call for me, commissioner?

07:00.838 --> 07:01.881
Bonnie.

07:21.734 --> 07:24.236
My name is Putnam, Batman.
Something I can do for you?

07:24.445 --> 07:27.615
- And my name is Cortland.
-Sorry, Mr. Cortland. I didn't see you.

07:27.823 --> 07:30.910
- Go right ahead, Batman.
-The transmitter seems perfectly in order.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.997
-It's been constant since we had to shut down.
-Did technicians check the coding circuits?

07:35.206 --> 07:36.666
- At all levels?
-Yes.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.794
However, I'd like to see them for ourselves.

07:40.002 --> 07:42.838
By all means. This way.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.134
The circuits are in here.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.973
Holy transistor's bill. What an installation.

07:52.473 --> 07:55.351
<i>Have you seen anything suspicious, Batman?</i>

07:55.559 --> 07:56.602
<i>- Hey, look--
No, Robin.</i>

07:56.811 --> 08:00.189
<i>Everything seems to be perfectly in order.</i>

08:00.398 --> 08:02.066
<i>No signs of tampering.</i>

08:02.274 --> 08:04.652
I told you he wouldn't catch it, Octavia.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.862
<i>I guess we 'll just have to keep looking.</i>

08:07.071 --> 08:08.114
Right, Batman?

08:08.322 --> 08:10.741
Yes, Robin. We'll just have to keep looking.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.494
He does have a warm, attractive voice,
doesn't he?

08:13.703 --> 08:17.248
So what? He's still a second-rate genius.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.583
You're just like all the women, Octavia.

08:19.792 --> 08:22.920
Taken in by his phony mystique and his--

08:23.129 --> 08:25.840
His warm, attractive voice.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.967
Don't complain.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.262
I'm pretty taken in by your warm,
attractive voice too, you know.

08:31.470 --> 08:35.140
Ohh, well, that's better. Ha-ha-ha.

08:37.268 --> 08:38.561
Thank you, Mr. Putnam.

08:38.769 --> 08:41.188
You can return to your duties.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.901
Some of the circuits definitely
have been tampered with, gentlemen.

08:46.110 --> 08:50.322
And I wouldn't be surprised if he planted
a microphone in the installation too.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.825
So he could listen in on anybody checking it.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.202
How devious and brilliant.

08:55.411 --> 08:56.454
Exactly.

08:56.662 --> 09:00.041
This Minstrel could present
one of the most deadly threats...

09:00.249 --> 09:02.126
...we've ever had to deal with.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.753
The devil you say.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.921
How do you wish to proceed, Batman?

09:06.172 --> 09:07.757
That depends on how he proceeds.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.593
If he thinks no one is wise to him,
he may be back.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.595
And we'll be waiting for him.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.014
Just tell me how many men you'll need,
Batman.

09:15.222 --> 09:19.810
None. The slightest suspicion
that it's a trap could scare him off.

09:20.144 --> 09:23.814
Sure, and it could at that.
Oh, that stick in the head, that is.

09:24.023 --> 09:26.192
As always, we'll play it
however you wish...

09:26.400 --> 09:28.819
...but we can't help being concerned about you.

09:29.153 --> 09:32.573
- Commissioner Gordon, after Penguin...
-And Archer.

09:32.782 --> 09:35.034
-...Clock King...
-And King Tut and Catwoman.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.537
...and all our other artful adversaries...

09:38.746 --> 09:43.584
...I don't think we'll have too much
of a problem with this Minstrel.

09:54.345 --> 09:56.806
- Dinner time, sir.
-Ah.

09:57.098 --> 10:00.017
A peanut butter and watercress sandwich
and a glass of milk...

10:00.226 --> 10:02.645
...would have been sufficient, Alfred.
-I know, sir.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.606
But I can't help worrying
about the two of you occasionally.

10:05.815 --> 10:08.192
The long hours, the meals you often miss.

10:08.400 --> 10:13.489
I hate to see this dual life
you're both leading taking its toll.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.450
Robin and I still have a few good years left.

10:16.659 --> 10:20.204
However, I do appreciate your concern.

10:21.163 --> 10:22.623
We'll dine in a moment, Alfred.

10:22.832 --> 10:25.709
But first, I'd like to get the kinks
out of this bug.

10:25.918 --> 10:28.045
Kinks out of the bug, sir?

10:28.254 --> 10:32.383
It's a bugging device with which we hope
to trap our latest adversary, Alfred.

10:32.550 --> 10:36.178
Oh. Would that be the Minstrel, sir?

10:36.387 --> 10:38.430
Yes, it is indeed, Alfred.

10:38.639 --> 10:39.932
You've heard of him, then?

10:40.141 --> 10:42.184
Oh, Gotham City's heard of him, sir.

10:42.393 --> 10:44.478
He seems to have most of the women
swooning...

10:44.687 --> 10:47.148
...over his so-called gentlemanly charm.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.316
And most of the men in a state of panic.

10:49.525 --> 10:53.070
Including, if I maybe allowed
the personal reference, myself.

10:53.571 --> 10:55.781
- You, Alfred?
-In panic?

10:56.282 --> 10:59.368
Well, I have managed to save
a tidy little sum on the side...

10:59.577 --> 11:02.955
...and made what I hope are some
wise investments on the stock market.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.666
You too, Alfred, wiped out by the Minstrel?

11:06.417 --> 11:08.544
No. Not exactly wiped out, Master Robin.

11:08.752 --> 11:13.048
I did manage to go down to the stock exchange
this morning while you two were in town...

11:13.257 --> 11:15.801
...and it certainly is chaos.

11:16.260 --> 11:17.469
Yes.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.846
Chaos.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.807
Whatever do you suppose
the rascal's up to, sir?

11:22.016 --> 11:25.769
What he told all of Gotham City
via his TV jamming device...

11:25.978 --> 11:28.063
...blackmail or calamity...

11:28.272 --> 11:31.192
...but we intend to prevent both.

11:31.525 --> 11:35.070
And how do you intend to trap the culprit?

11:35.279 --> 11:37.323
If I may be so inquisitive, sir.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.700
I suspect he planted a microphone...

11:39.909 --> 11:43.329
...in the transmissions room
of the stock exchange building.

11:43.537 --> 11:47.166
And tonight, he'll be back to check on it.
So we fight fire with fire.

11:47.374 --> 11:51.921
We plant a microphone and we check on it.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.756
There's one thing that worries me.

11:53.964 --> 11:56.634
Getting back into that building
without being noticed.

11:57.259 --> 12:00.304
I'm sure that can be handled.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.810
- Yes, Batman.
- Commissioner.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.812
Could you arrange with Mr. Cortland...

12:09.021 --> 12:12.691
...for Robin and me to return to the corridor
outside the transmission room tonight?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.735
I'm sure he'll cooperate, Batman.

12:14.944 --> 12:18.364
And perhaps find us an isolated office
for a short time.

12:18.948 --> 12:20.783
You mean a temporary hideout?

12:21.325 --> 12:24.662
I can't go into details, commissioner.
I'm sure you understand.

12:24.954 --> 12:28.249
I'll contact Mr. Cortland at once, Batman.
But let me repeat now.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.626
Please, please be careful.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.964
Who knows what devious tricks
this evil balladeer maybe up to.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.591
You have my assurance.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.158
"A Wandering Minstrel."

13:03.367 --> 13:06.537
- That's the same tune he sang on TV.
-Right, Robin.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.957
- You think it could be some kind of signal?
-Yes, it could, old chap.

13:10.165 --> 13:13.711
Let's take a look. Easy now.

13:30.144 --> 13:33.731
Oh. Oh!
Do you always sneak up on people like that?

13:34.356 --> 13:35.399
No.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.987
That's okay. You here kind of early, aren't you?

13:40.362 --> 13:42.948
So you were expecting us.

13:43.532 --> 13:47.244
Are you kidding?
They told me to expect a new replacement.

13:47.453 --> 13:49.455
I just didn't know there'd be two of you.

13:49.663 --> 13:50.956
Anyhow, you got here.

13:51.248 --> 13:55.419
Glad you wore your old clothes.
This jam is a mess.

14:04.803 --> 14:07.181
Good evening, gentlemen.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.939
Holy rainbow.

14:16.148 --> 14:17.274
I'm blinded.

14:21.278 --> 14:23.447
An ingenious device.

14:30.329 --> 14:34.124
<i>Good night, Batman
Good night, Robin</i>

14:34.333 --> 14:39.004
<i>Good night, Batman
I'm going to leave you now</i>

14:39.171 --> 14:40.422
Ha-ha-ha!

14:42.216 --> 14:44.385
I don't understand.

14:44.593 --> 14:47.054
How could he have gotten away?

14:47.262 --> 14:50.808
Commissioner, we were half blinded
by Minstrel's electronic flashes.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.684
Ah-ha! Ah.

14:52.935 --> 14:56.897
Apparently, we interrupted him
before he could remove the last of these.

14:57.106 --> 15:00.275
You mean that tiny thing
caused all the trouble?

15:00.484 --> 15:04.363
Yes. And there was one
for each number's circuit of course.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.739
What is it?

15:05.948 --> 15:08.450
A heterodyning counter-oscillator
would be my guess...

15:08.659 --> 15:11.412
...and a marvel of miniaturization.
-Mm.

15:11.787 --> 15:12.955
To confuse the frequency.

15:13.163 --> 15:15.582
So each number has to come out
anything but right.

15:15.791 --> 15:20.170
Commissioner, all Gotham City is in danger
while this musical criminal is at large.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.007
He exhibits a degree
of electronic sophistication...

15:24.216 --> 15:27.594
...far beyond anyone in the world today.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.557
He exhibits a degree
of electronic sophistication...

15:31.765 --> 15:34.351
...far beyond that of anyone else
in this world today.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.395
Except me of course.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.023
If, as I suspect, he spotted
the counter-oscillators by now...

15:40.232 --> 15:41.984
...he knows the place was bugged.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.111
Smarter than you thought he was.

15:44.319 --> 15:48.073
You're absolutely right, my dear.
He must be eliminated after all.

15:48.282 --> 15:52.786
We can count on him to come to us.
All we have to do is be certain we're ready.

15:52.995 --> 15:56.123
Well, how do you mean you can count on him?

15:56.331 --> 15:58.584
He's waiting for me to go on the air again,
Bass.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.462
So he can use our signal to lead him to us.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.840
So we'll work from the studio, not here.
See that it's ready, Treble.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.009
But how can he use our signal?

16:07.217 --> 16:08.594
Unless he's a bird.

16:08.802 --> 16:12.097
The beam is so narrow,
he can't even pick it up on the ground.

16:12.431 --> 16:15.225
He'll work out some way, you can bet on that.

16:19.897 --> 16:22.149
Fascinating bird, sir. What is it?

16:22.357 --> 16:24.943
It's a Batdrone plane, Alfred.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.404
We can direct it from here
by remote control.

16:27.613 --> 16:28.864
Direct it?

16:29.072 --> 16:31.742
Yes, if the Minstrel goes on the air again...

16:31.950 --> 16:36.121
...and I suspect he will, if only to taunt me...

16:36.330 --> 16:39.249
...I think this bird
should pick up his wavelength.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.711
- And locate his broadcasting studio.
- Mm.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.048
There we are.

16:46.256 --> 16:49.218
Robin, let's test the drone.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.435
That could be the studio signal.

17:01.772 --> 17:02.814
Raise the level.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.906
That's it. Perfect.

17:12.115 --> 17:16.286
The Minstrel may be in for a surprise.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.375
I believe you're right, sir.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.211
Here comes the brazen fellow.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.923
<i>I've offered the brokers a fair way out...</i>

17:28.131 --> 17:30.759
<i>...but as yet they haven't accepted that plan.</i>

17:31.426 --> 17:34.346
<i>In status that driven to mistrust and doubt...</i>

17:34.555 --> 17:37.182
<i>...they've turned for help to Robin and Batman.</i>

17:37.391 --> 17:38.976
The audacity of it.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.228
Getting anything?

17:41.436 --> 17:43.021
The Batdrone's changed course.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.649
It's pick up the studio signal, all right.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.360
<i>But I foiled the dauntless duo before.</i>

17:48.777 --> 17:51.989
<i>With nothing more startling
than a spark and a flash.</i>

17:52.197 --> 17:54.366
<i>And though violence...</i>

17:54.575 --> 17:57.119
<i>...is something I strongly abhor...</i>

17:57.327 --> 18:01.707
...I <i>warned them that next time
they'll land with</i> a <i>crash.</i>

18:02.207 --> 18:04.626
-It's descending, Batman.
-At what angle?

18:04.835 --> 18:10.007
- Eleven degrees, four minutes.
-Eleven degrees, four minutes.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.927
Well, that should put the plane down
somewhere over Gotham Park Lake.

18:14.136 --> 18:17.347
At the intersection of Willow and Fourth Street.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.016
There's nothing there, Batman.

18:19.224 --> 18:22.060
Except the old Willow Street Warehouse.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.730
That must be it.

18:24.938 --> 18:28.859
It's been a long night. It's going to be
a big day. Let's get going.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.403
Alfred, bring the plane back.

18:31.612 --> 18:32.821
- Me, sir?
-Yes.

18:33.030 --> 18:37.034
- Throw the Batdrone retriever switch.

18:57.638 --> 18:58.972
Oh!

19:07.522 --> 19:10.734
We can be expecting the Caped Crusaders
any minute now.

19:10.942 --> 19:14.029
- This early, boss?
-You can bet they've picked up the signal.

19:14.237 --> 19:17.491
They're on their way.
Just be sure we're ready.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.493
Cameras all set, Treble?

19:19.701 --> 19:22.162
I just love suspense like this.

19:22.371 --> 19:26.667
Well, it's too bad, the suspense
will soon be over, Octavia.

19:41.807 --> 19:43.141
Look, no door knobs.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.935
I know. This must be the place.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.813
And the broadcasting studio
is probably on the top floor.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.649
Stand clear. Up we go.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.199
All right, men.

19:59.408 --> 20:04.246
Alert the boys in the storeroom
and put Plan Low C into action.

20:06.665 --> 20:07.708
What a pity, Robin...

20:07.916 --> 20:12.212
...that a man of his musical talents, who could
bring such pleasure to millions of people...

20:12.421 --> 20:16.133
...should pervert that genius
to criminal antisocial ends.

20:16.341 --> 20:19.928
Especially when he could earn
a good living from just records.

20:20.137 --> 20:25.183
- Look. That open window, shall we try it?
-Yes, Robin.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.395
The opportunity well-taken
is always a weapon of advantage.

20:28.603 --> 20:31.606
Be careful. It may be a trap.

20:46.872 --> 20:49.124
It is a trap.

21:11.772 --> 21:14.608
Pow! Wham!
Look at the Dynamic Duo.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.359
They are efficient, aren't they?

21:16.568 --> 21:18.695
Do you think they'll win, Minstrel?

22:08.829 --> 22:10.330
Holy fly trap.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.090
You're making a mistake, Minstrel.

22:20.298 --> 22:24.261
With your genius, you could be a tremendous
force for good in the world.

22:24.469 --> 22:25.554
Why waste it?

22:25.971 --> 22:29.140
I was regretting the necessity
of doing away with you, Batman.

22:29.349 --> 22:31.309
A kindred genius, you know.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.479
But if there's anything I can't abide,
it's a reformer.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.982
Activate the turnspit motor.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.528
Motor activated.

22:45.323 --> 22:47.492
In just a few minutes, gentlemen...

22:47.701 --> 22:51.788
...we'll be prepared to serve
barbecued crusader if we have a call for it.

22:52.122 --> 22:57.168
You see, we've installed just beneath you,
super units of a radar type grill.

22:57.377 --> 23:01.840
As you revolve, it can turn you
from rare to medium to well done.

23:02.048 --> 23:04.175
Depending on the preference.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.052
Throw the switch.

23:06.261 --> 23:08.221
Switch is set.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.899
Holy hot spot, Batman. What can we do?

23:19.107 --> 23:21.568
Nothing, Boy Wonder. Nothing but cook.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.698
Are you sure this is a good idea, Minstrel?

23:26.907 --> 23:28.491
Good? It's perfect.

23:28.700 --> 23:33.079
Besides, my dear, there's no alternative.
It's Batman or the Minstrel.

23:33.288 --> 23:37.250
The world isn't ready for both of us yet.
Heh, heh.

23:44.049 --> 23:47.510
<i>Batman and Robin
Rotate and revolve</i>

23:47.719 --> 23:51.431
<i>As the heat grows
Your bodies dissolve</i>

23:51.640 --> 23:54.893
<i>When it's still hotter
Then you will melt</i>

23:55.185 --> 24:00.065
<i>Nothing left but your utility belt</i>

24:01.358 --> 24:04.069
Is this it, Batman?
Is this the end?

24:04.277 --> 24:06.446
If it is, Robin...

24:06.655 --> 24:07.781
...let's...

24:07.989 --> 24:10.450
...not lose our dignity.
