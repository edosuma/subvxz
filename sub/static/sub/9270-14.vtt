00:05.000 --> 00:09.910
And on Thursday, I took the Lord's
name in vain when I got a splinter.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.950
I am sorry for this
and all of my sins.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.990
Ego te absolve a peccatis tuis
in nomine Patris et Filii et...

00:18.040 --> 00:19.030
One more thing.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.320
By 11 in the morning tomorrow,
Bishop Talbot will be shot dead.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.340
How do you know this?

00:33.800 --> 00:36.310
Oh, there you are, Father.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.630
The bishop's office
has just telephoned.

00:38.680 --> 00:42.840
Bishop Talbot won't be coming to deliver the
Corpus Christi homily tomorrow after all.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.020
Would you believe it?
He's off shooting birds.

00:47.400 --> 00:55.400
Shooting?!

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:19.800 --> 01:23.270
Bentley Duke has invited me
to go shooting on his estate.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.440
Bentley Duke? What, the
theatrical impresario?

01:27.400 --> 01:29.390
But, My Lord, you loathe the theatre.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.750
Yeah, well, I do.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.510
However, Duke has offered to fund

01:33.560 --> 01:36.750
all the repairs to the
tower at St George.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.990
Ah...

01:38.040 --> 01:39.070
Unexpected?

01:39.120 --> 01:40.990
He has a house nearby.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.150
Says he finds St George...

01:43.200 --> 01:44.800
inspirational.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.950
Well, I would love to use his
ill-gotten gains for better use.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.560
So, tomorrow, God willing,
we shall seal the deal.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.390
Will you be alone together?

01:56.440 --> 01:57.580
No.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.030
There'll be other heathens
of the theatre world.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.150
And dear Lady Felicia,

02:03.200 --> 02:04.790
thank goodness.

02:04.840 --> 02:09.150
My Lord, I wonder if you might rearrange
your meeting with Mr Duke?

02:09.199 --> 02:11.540
Why on earth should I do that?

02:11.600 --> 02:16.040
I may not have told you before how
much my congregation look forward
to your homily on Corpus Christi.

02:17.040 --> 02:18.150
Well, tell me now.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.230
Well, for many of them,

02:19.280 --> 02:22.380
it is simply the highlight
of the church calendar.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.190
Oh, I see.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.950
Well, being stuck with your tedious
witterings all year round,

02:27.000 --> 02:28.350
I'm not surprised.

02:28.400 --> 02:33.400
But that's still no reason for putting
the whole future of St George in jeopardy.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
But, My Lord, shooting?

02:37.360 --> 02:39.030
It's like golf.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.350
It livens up a good country walk.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.030
Yes, but, with respect, My Lord,

02:45.080 --> 02:48.750
golf does not involve the
slaughter of God's creatures.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.950
Controlling the bird population doesn't
trouble the Vatican, Brown.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.470
As you well know.

02:53.520 --> 02:57.270
But, My Lord, why not meet Mr Duke
after your homily at St Mary's?

02:57.320 --> 02:59.120
Or at the theatre?

03:01.880 --> 03:03.310
Are you all right, Brown?

03:03.360 --> 03:04.750
Perfectly well.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.110
In that case, get out of my way.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.680
I have a course record to beat.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.040
Bah! Eh?

03:17.080 --> 03:18.750
I'm so thrilled you
could join us, Bish.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.070
I only hope I don't embarrass
myself, Mr Duke.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.510
Isn't life full of surprises?

03:22.560 --> 03:26.230
I always assumed you devil dodgers
disapproved of cold-blooded killing.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.430
And then two of you sign up for this.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.470
Two?

03:29.520 --> 03:31.190
Your colleague.

03:33.520 --> 03:36.430
I'm very grateful to
you for organising this.

03:36.480 --> 03:38.590
Grateful enough to tell
me what you're up to?

03:38.640 --> 03:41.670
As you know, I will always drop
everything to support the bishop.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.790
Mm-hm.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.430
Well, it's my goddaughter
Natasha you have to thank.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.510
That's her, talking to Bentley Duke.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.110
She got me on the list, too.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.990
She seems to have Bentley
wrapped round her finger.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.790
So, why are you here?

03:53.840 --> 03:56.630
To meet Bentley Duke. I loved acting.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.270
I was in all the school productions.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.190
So, you want to talk to
him about the theatre?

04:01.240 --> 04:04.240
No. I want a part in
one of his productions.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.350
~ My Lord.
~ What in the devil's name
is the meaning of this?

04:07.400 --> 04:10.200
Well... it's a peculiar
quirk of fate.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.710
Lady Felicia insisted
I accompany her.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.900
Didn't you, Lady Felicia?

04:16.440 --> 04:20.920
If you do anything to jeopardise
my discussion with Mr Duke,

04:21.920 --> 04:25.710
I shall have you strung from
the crypt at St George

04:25.760 --> 04:27.030
with a shotgun up your...

04:27.080 --> 04:29.020
~ Darling Felicia!
~ Oh!

04:29.840 --> 04:31.190
Hello! I'm Natasha.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.030
Father Brown.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.270
I am indebted to you.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.550
Don't be silly.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.030
Any friend of my wonderful
godmother is a friend of mine.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.070
Natasha has the lead role in Room
For Three? at Cheltenham Rep.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.110
A new play?

04:44.160 --> 04:45.790
Yes. It's rather naughty.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.830
Then I shall be booking
tickets immediately.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.110
Felicia said you were fun!

04:50.160 --> 04:51.550
Natasha, you unforgivable liar!

04:51.600 --> 04:54.190
You told me you were bringing
your godmother, not your sister!

04:54.240 --> 04:55.710
Oh, Bentley!

04:55.760 --> 04:57.230
Bentley Duke.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.870
~ Lady Felicia Montague.
~ Delighted.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.670
And you must be this spectacular
girl's, what, grandfather?

05:01.720 --> 05:02.790
Ah!

05:02.840 --> 05:04.150
Father Brown.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.270
I'm very grateful that you
could accommodate me today.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.390
What Natasha wants, Natasha gets.

05:09.440 --> 05:13.430
I must say, though, your boss looked
less than thrilled to see you.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.480
Yes, I remind him of the
paperwork left on his desk.

05:17.760 --> 05:20.430
So, the Cotswolds have
enticed you out of London?

05:20.480 --> 05:24.190
When London bites, I come out to
the country to lick my wounds.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.270
Your murder weapon.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.670
No. Thank you.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.030
Oh...

05:28.080 --> 05:29.480
Oh, dear.

05:30.360 --> 05:33.760
Natasha, darling, I need you to check
whether my barrel is straight enough.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.590
The Lord Chamberlain,
the theatre censor,

05:36.640 --> 05:39.350
banned Bentley's last production
from the West End.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.400
Decided it was too racy.
Bentley lost thousands.

05:43.720 --> 05:45.670
Who's that?

05:45.720 --> 05:47.230
Peter Redhill.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.590
Oh, yes.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.920
He acts, he directs and
he's a bit of a dish.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.510
~ Isn't he married to a member
of the royal family?
~ Yes.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.460
Which is why his affair with Natasha
was the talk of the press.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.000
Not the press I read, evidently.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.240
Fascinating...

06:06.920 --> 06:08.260
WHISTLE

06:10.160 --> 06:11.630
HOUNDS BARK

06:19.360 --> 06:21.000
SHOTGUN FIRE

06:25.280 --> 06:26.670
Got it!

06:26.720 --> 06:28.350
LAUGHS RAUCOUSLY

06:28.400 --> 06:31.560
~ I've got some catching up to do.
~ I wasn't aware it was a competition.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.540
Closer.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.000
Oh, dear...

06:47.160 --> 06:50.750
So, Bishop Talbot, do you think adulterers
should be treated like murderers?

06:50.800 --> 06:53.550
I think marriage is
sacred, Mr Redhill.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.750
~ Well, that is not quite the same thing.
~ Peter...

06:55.800 --> 06:57.230
You said in The Times, and I quote,

06:57.280 --> 07:00.790
that "we should treat the ending of a marriage
as seriously as the death of a person."

07:00.840 --> 07:01.950
I did indeed.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.310
And then you singled me out
for destroying my marriage.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.870
The newspapers singled you out
when they put pictures of you

07:06.920 --> 07:10.110
~ cavorting with your mistress
on their front pages!
~ So, I am a murderer.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.470
Well, don't we execute
murderers in this country?

07:12.520 --> 07:13.790
Go on, then. Shoot me!

07:13.840 --> 07:17.510
Does the drinking help you
with your aim, Mr Redhill?

07:17.560 --> 07:20.990
Do you find being a righteous prig
helps you sleep at night, Bishop?

07:21.040 --> 07:23.110
Who's this, your lapdog?

07:24.600 --> 07:25.910
Sober up you, fool.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.560
There's only one fool here, Bentley.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.190
Good work, Davies.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.110
Thank you, My Lord.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.580
WHISTLE

07:36.320 --> 07:38.320
Drive over. Follow me.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.750
Is the next drive far, Mr Duke?

08:02.800 --> 08:04.470
Just over here.

08:08.110 --> 08:09.110
Oh, pooh drops!

08:09.160 --> 08:11.310
Is it entirely safe shooting here?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.590
No. But as the London critics
love to point out,

08:13.640 --> 08:16.510
I do have something
of a reckless streak.

08:17.240 --> 08:20.560
Mr Duke... We should talk about
the tower at St George.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.350
~ Privately.
~ Oh, absolutely.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.870
But, first, call of
nature and all that.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.390
Of course.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.920
~ Awful man.
~ My Lord...

08:30.480 --> 08:32.549
Oh, do run along, Brown!

08:34.440 --> 08:36.030
Have you gone deaf, Brown?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.630
My Lord, you need to leave now.

08:38.679 --> 08:41.549
~ Please.
~ Have you gone utterly mad, Brown?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.740
~ Down!
~ What on earth...?!

08:49.840 --> 08:51.190
My Lord?

08:51.240 --> 08:52.910
I've been shot.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.830
Where is the pain?

08:55.880 --> 08:57.710
No pain.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.500
Just numbness...

09:16.600 --> 09:19.590
Ah, Inspector Sullivan.
Did anyone see the sniper?

09:19.640 --> 09:20.710
No.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.190
But the offending cartridge tells me
it was someone in this shooting party.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.070
Problem is, you were all
separated at the time.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.510
How long was the deceased
in your service?

09:29.560 --> 09:31.110
Who, Davies?

09:31.160 --> 09:33.190
Five years. Ten, maybe.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.270
It seems he had an altercation with
Mr Redhill shortly before his death.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.950
Yes.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.910
Regular theatre-goer, was he?

09:39.960 --> 09:41.190
Davies?

09:41.240 --> 09:42.670
Never set foot in the theatre.

09:42.720 --> 09:43.750
Right.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.790
Inspector Sullivan...

09:45.840 --> 09:48.840
Forgive me, surely the
shot was meant for me?

09:49.760 --> 09:51.830
You? I don't think so.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.950
Father Brown said he saw the
gun fired from over there,

09:55.000 --> 09:57.070
along with this cartridge
still smoking.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.670
The gunman, or woman, would have
to have been virtually blind

10:00.720 --> 10:02.190
to have missed you by that margin.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.670
Davies was the target.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.710
No, but...

10:04.760 --> 10:06.350
~ Brown!
~ My Lord?

10:06.400 --> 10:09.390
Moments before the shot, Father
Brown told me I had to leave.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.640
He was certain I was in trouble.
Weren't you, Brown?

10:15.720 --> 10:17.590
Is this true, Brown?

10:19.040 --> 10:20.400
Well?

10:21.520 --> 10:23.110
I haven't got time for this.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.760
Mr Redhill...

10:25.320 --> 10:27.460
Where's your tongue, man?

10:29.440 --> 10:31.710
Please, forgive me, My Lord.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.620
CHURCH BELL TOLLS

10:47.800 --> 10:51.030
He didn't set the world
alight, my husband.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.670
But he was a good man.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.750
Honest.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.070
Loyal.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.550
God will hold your hand
through this, Ethel.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.400
Thank you, Father.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.400
Can you manage, financially?

11:05.680 --> 11:07.430
I've been prudent all my life.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.950
Done extra work. Put money aside.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.380
No, it's the loneliness
I'm worried about.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.240
Albert wasn't a talker.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.240
But he did just sit and listen.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.270
Landlord at the old Red Lion's
going to miss him, an' all.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.790
Albert was a teetotaller when I
tied the knot for him and Ethel.

11:33.840 --> 11:36.030
Well, that's marriage for you!

11:36.080 --> 11:38.310
So, who's the killer, then?

11:38.360 --> 11:41.950
Well, assuming it's a member
of the shooting party,

11:42.000 --> 11:45.310
I think we can eliminate Lady
Felicia from the suspect list.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.300
Not really her style.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.080
Which means it must be one
of "the theatre heathen".

11:57.000 --> 11:59.110
You want to sit in on rehearsals?

11:59.160 --> 12:01.190
Well, I wish to follow
your lead, Mr Duke,

12:01.240 --> 12:03.710
in building a bridge between
the church and the theatre.

12:03.760 --> 12:06.030
What bridge have I ever
built with you lot?

12:06.080 --> 12:09.180
By offering to fund the
rebuilding of St George's.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.230
Your boss was never
going to see a penny.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.630
~ I got him on that shoot purely for sport.
~ Sport?

12:14.680 --> 12:18.380
To wind up Peter Redhill. Our
very own lapsed Catholic boy.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.880
Reminds me. I must ring your boss to
tell him that, sadly, the deal's off.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.060
Do you have a grudge
against Bishop Talbot?

12:26.840 --> 12:29.780
He peddles hypocrisy
and lies. You all do.

12:30.280 --> 12:32.950
While theatre is all about the truth.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.990
We reflect reality.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.030
You disguise and distort it.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.550
Thank you for dropping by.

12:38.600 --> 12:42.520
I was very sorry to hear about your
recent West End show being closed.

12:43.520 --> 12:45.230
Yes, I'm sure you were.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.350
I read the script of
A Rather Private Affair

12:48.400 --> 12:50.150
and found it very enjoyable.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.430
The scene where the priest confesses

12:52.480 --> 12:54.790
his infatuation to the mother-in-law

12:54.840 --> 12:56.640
was very amusing.

12:57.720 --> 13:01.470
So, this is why the bishop calls
you his "blackest sheep".

13:01.520 --> 13:04.590
What would he say if he knew
you were here with me now?

13:04.640 --> 13:06.980
I imagine he would disapprove.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.550
Strongly.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.070
In fact...

13:10.840 --> 13:12.310
.. he would be furious.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.960
Would he, now?

13:15.120 --> 13:18.310
It's lovely. But I think you can
make her even more arch here.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.350
Sorry to interrupt, Peter.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.110
Our friend Father Brown's going
to be popping in and out of
rehearsals from time to time.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.790
Hope that's all right.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.150
What?

13:27.200 --> 13:30.720
I promise I will be as quiet as the
proverbial church mouse, Mr Redhill.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.030
Aren't you having enough
fun at my expense?

13:40.080 --> 13:42.510
~ Don't be so paranoid.
I'm doing you a favour.
~ A favour?

13:42.560 --> 13:44.270
Your friend the bishop will be livid.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.350
Almost as livid as you must have been
when you missed him from five yards.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.000
How dare you!

13:50.480 --> 13:53.420
Right. Let's run that
last sequence again.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.470
You are a marvel, Father.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.110
Lady Felicia! Don't tell me Bentley
Duke's given you a part already?

14:04.160 --> 14:07.670
~ No. But he's very keen to see my passion.
~ I'm sure he is.

14:07.720 --> 14:10.070
So, I've offered to help
out with some fundraising.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.670
I've no need to ask why you're here.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.110
Natasha's not involved, is she?

14:15.160 --> 14:17.230
I think it is the work of a man.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.350
Thank goodness for that.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.910
Oh, gosh, I hope it wasn't Peter.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.350
Where would you like
to go from, Peter?

14:26.400 --> 14:29.390
We've just left scene
two and go to where...

14:29.440 --> 14:31.390
So...

14:31.440 --> 14:32.910
Room For Three?

14:32.960 --> 14:34.310
Yes.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.030
It's a frightfully funny play.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.670
You see, Peter's character
is unhappily married

14:38.720 --> 14:40.070
to this awful woman.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.910
And they go away to this
hotel on a golfing holiday

14:42.960 --> 14:45.670
where Peter meets Natasha, who's
staying in the next room.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.660
And then the two of them,
well, you know...

14:49.600 --> 14:51.340
~ Get on?
~ Exactly.

14:51.880 --> 14:55.310
But, then, Peter hurts his back
playing golf and is bedbound.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.390
So then, it's all about doors
opening and doors closing

14:58.440 --> 15:00.950
and whether his wife will find
out and catch them at it.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.670
Take your time!

15:07.600 --> 15:09.430
I heard every word. She's awful!

15:09.480 --> 15:12.310
What it's really about is whether
Peter and Natasha love each other

15:12.360 --> 15:13.950
or if it's all just a bit of fun.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.230
I see...

15:15.280 --> 15:17.070
A most unfortunate
sequence of events.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.070
It all began with a watering can.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.550
How dreadful!

15:20.600 --> 15:24.470
Listen, we've got 43 minutes
before she's back from lunch.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.990
My wife is nothing if
not a creature of habit.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.580
Oh, darling!

15:39.280 --> 15:42.190
You imagining your first
performance, perchance?

15:42.240 --> 15:43.440
I am.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.910
Your goddaughter is a natural.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.190
Isn't she?

15:48.240 --> 15:49.830
It's so good to catch up.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.550
We used to see so much of each other.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.300
She'd come up nearly every holidays,
until she was about 14.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.110
She had a family in the area.

15:57.160 --> 15:58.500
Oh? Who?

16:00.240 --> 16:02.230
Just an uncle, actually.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.960
Winston Grater.

16:05.400 --> 16:08.390
Winston... Yes. Moved to Cirencester.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.150
~ You knew him?
~ A regular at St Mary's.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.470
I still get a Christmas card.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.680
What?

16:19.600 --> 16:21.200
Lady Felicia?

16:22.480 --> 16:25.560
Well, you don't have to tell
me, if you don't want to.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.630
That man did vile...

16:33.760 --> 16:35.630
vile things to her.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.910
You understand?

16:39.320 --> 16:40.990
She was just a girl.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.780
It was so awful.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.510
I mean, she did tell her parents.
They didn't believe her.

16:47.560 --> 16:49.070
Didn't believe who?

16:49.120 --> 16:50.550
Inspector Sullivan.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.150
I might have known you'd have
wormed your way in here, Father.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.750
Are you here to buy tickets for
the performance, Inspector?

16:55.800 --> 16:57.870
No. I have some more questions
for Peter Redhill.

16:57.920 --> 17:01.510
He's at lunch. And rehearsals don't
begin again until half-past three.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.590
Right.

17:02.640 --> 17:06.550
Have you established a deeper link
between Mr Redhill and the bishop?

17:06.599 --> 17:09.430
If I have, rest assured, you'll
be the last to hear, Father.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.390
Because, if Mr Redhill wanted
to kill anyone in the woods,

17:13.440 --> 17:15.190
it would have been Bentley Duke.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.349
Why is that?

17:16.400 --> 17:19.839
Because the love of his life
is now in Mr Duke's arms.

17:21.680 --> 17:24.619
I'm sure that's no news
to you, Inspector.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.480
A sensible career move
on her part, I'm sure.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.510
Oh, Bishop Talbot is looking for you.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.750
He's been insisting that
he was the real target.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.710
You jumping on him must
have unhinged him.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.360
It certainly would have unhinged me.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.880
I was baffled by your
behaviour in the woods.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.400
But, suddenly, this
morning I understood.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.880
You heard in confessional
that I was to be shot.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.430
Am I right?

17:58.840 --> 18:01.240
Well, the seal is... sacrosanct.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.590
However, you were prepared to
act according to what you heard.

18:05.640 --> 18:08.440
And for that, of course,
I am grateful.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.230
But my would-be assassin
is still at large.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.350
And because Inspector Sullivan
doesn't seem interested,

18:15.400 --> 18:17.510
I'm sure the good Lord,
in all His wisdom,

18:17.560 --> 18:19.560
would forgive you if...

18:21.080 --> 18:23.480
.. you dropped a hint who it is.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.980
Brown...

18:32.120 --> 18:34.870
I couldn't help noticing
that you have a collection

18:34.920 --> 18:37.060
of stage play manuscripts.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.440
Don't Kiss Me, I'm From Surrey.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.060
This was banned for blasphemy.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.990
~ How did you get it?
~ Brown, this is highly important.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.030
Banned.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.420
Banned.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.340
Highly controversial.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.620
Banned.

18:54.840 --> 18:59.310
I had no idea, My Lord, that you
had an interest in the theatre.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.560
Oh, the Lord Chamberlain
and I are old friends.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.150
He sends me all the
latest play texts.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.470
May I ask why?

19:07.520 --> 19:09.460
He values my opinion.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.200
Now, look, could we get back
to the matter in hand?

19:13.480 --> 19:15.280
Who was it, Brown?

19:15.800 --> 19:18.950
Would you mind if I borrowed
Don't Kiss Me, I'm From Surrey?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.950
I'm very keen to read it.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.670
Would you mind?

19:29.160 --> 19:32.390
Peter Redhill might well have
had reason to kill the bishop.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.800
But he's a crack shot. Even when
drunk, he wouldn't have missed.

19:38.040 --> 19:41.230
Bentley Duke, on the other
hand, is so wayward,

19:41.280 --> 19:44.680
he could have missed the bishop,
even from that range.

19:45.160 --> 19:49.080
But why would Bentley Duke have
wanted to kill the bishop?

19:50.200 --> 19:51.910
Don't tell me you're stuck, Father.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.510
I am.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.030
Yes.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.550
I am stuck.

19:58.040 --> 19:59.830
Go back to the scene of the crime.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.360
I do so regularly, in my mind.

20:03.320 --> 20:06.960
And on every occasion
I return empty-handed.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.150
You know, some people say I
have my head in the clouds.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.070
I wouldn't dare comment
on your personality.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.590
Your calves, on the other hand...

20:17.360 --> 20:18.790
Darling...!

20:18.840 --> 20:19.950
There you are!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.140
The scene of the crime...

20:23.680 --> 20:25.420
~ Of course!
~ What?

20:28.120 --> 20:30.920
Never has the phrase been more apt.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.260
~ It was a scene...
~ Was it?

20:35.480 --> 20:37.480
I was assigned a role.

20:38.080 --> 20:42.160
My character was there to distract
from what was really happening.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.350
Inspector Sullivan was right.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.200
Davies was the intended target.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.190
~ Sid...
~ Mm-hm?

21:00.240 --> 21:02.510
I need you to go to the pub.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.230
Right. Any in particular?

21:04.280 --> 21:05.390
Red Lion.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.590
I need you to talk to Davies'
old drinking chums.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.920
Find out if it really was marriage
that drove him to drink.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.910
What about Lady F?

21:14.960 --> 21:16.960
You have her blessing.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.280
Oh...

21:25.640 --> 21:28.640
It's a tough job, but
someone's got to do it.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.110
~ You want protection?
~ Yes.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.550
I thought having someone covering your
back, so to speak, was a perk of the job.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.230
Inspector, this is a serious matter.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.830
The person who tried to kill me
in those woods will try again.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.350
I am convinced.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.990
Look, as I've already advised,

21:44.040 --> 21:46.990
you shouldn't read anything into
what Father Brown says or does.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.440
This has nothing to do with
Father Brown any more.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.720
This morning, I received a phone
call which has convinced me someone
in those woods wanted me dead!

21:59.160 --> 22:02.760
All right, it wasn't marriage
that drove Davies to drink.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.120
It was gambling debts.

22:05.720 --> 22:08.870
Our little Davies
was an active member

22:08.920 --> 22:11.830
of the Kembleford underground
horse-betting fraternity.

22:11.880 --> 22:16.320
Which is not an easy thing to say on five pints
of Stoat's Tipple, I can tell you that.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.270
A week before he died,

22:19.320 --> 22:23.670
Davies put a small fortune
on a dead cert at Kempton.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.350
But guess what? It fell at the first.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.760
But here's the thing. Davies
was completely skint.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.560
Everybody knew it.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.360
~ So, where did he get the money for the bet?
~ Ah-ha...

22:39.760 --> 22:41.510
Your embroideries are wonderful.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.360
It's just a hobby.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.870
You should never play
down your passions.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.190
That was Albert's favourite.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.440
I made that for our silver
wedding anniversary.

22:54.880 --> 22:58.080
~ Have you ever considered
selling any of these?
~ No!

22:58.960 --> 23:00.790
Who'd want any of those things?

23:00.840 --> 23:02.270
Plenty of people.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.120
And they'd pay a pretty
penny, I'm sure.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.400
I might buy one myself.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.310
You don't say!

23:09.360 --> 23:13.060
What am I saying, how rude of
me? These are deeply personal.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.720
And it's not as if you need the
money, what with all your savings.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.430
Well, if there's one that
takes your fancy, Father,

23:22.480 --> 23:24.910
I might be open to persuasion.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.630
No, Ethel. I was wrong to suggest it.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.270
The thing is...

23:30.800 --> 23:32.350
.. I do need the money.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.400
Why? What happened?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.270
Now, there's a man on a mission.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.320
I recognised the bicycle.
A visit of compassion?

23:45.960 --> 23:47.350
One does what one can.

23:47.400 --> 23:50.150
See, I had a shilling bet with
Goodfellow that you were really here

23:50.200 --> 23:53.070
because you'd found out about Davies
stealing all Ethel's savings.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.510
I bet another shilling that,
having spoken to Ethel,

23:55.560 --> 23:58.550
you'd head straight for Laceman's
Sewing Factory to check her alibi.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.670
Might she have sneaked into
the woods, stolen a cartridge

24:01.720 --> 24:03.660
and shot her husband?

24:06.240 --> 24:07.640
Er-hum...

24:09.480 --> 24:11.590
Let me save you a journey, Father.

24:11.640 --> 24:14.950
12 women at the sewing factory
gave me sworn statements

24:15.000 --> 24:17.910
that Ethel never left her
machine that morning.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.700
She didn't do it.

24:20.910 --> 24:21.910
I see.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.510
Oh, if it's any consolation,

24:23.560 --> 24:26.990
I've spent most of this investigation
down a blind alley myself.

24:27.040 --> 24:30.640
You see, I really thought Davies
was the intended victim.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.870
But now, thanks to your
bishop, I'm back on track.

24:33.920 --> 24:36.150
All right, Sergeant, now
we've got our motive,

24:36.200 --> 24:37.630
let's go and get our man.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.310
We should be just in time for
the final dress rehearsal.

24:40.360 --> 24:41.760
Tally-ho!

24:47.480 --> 24:49.400
Revenge? For what?

24:50.600 --> 24:54.300
For Bishop Talbot wiping out
a large chunk of your fortune.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.150
Well, go on, then, Inspector.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.640
I warn you, though, spotting holes
in stories is how I made my fortune.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.190
The Lord Chamberlain closed down
your recent West End production,

25:05.240 --> 25:06.470
A Rather Private Affair,

25:06.520 --> 25:08.070
after just two performances.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.630
It was sold out for five months

25:09.680 --> 25:11.670
and you lost £10,000.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.590
It must have been hilarious.

25:13.640 --> 25:14.670
The show, I mean.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.150
This isn't news, Inspector.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.790
Bishop Talbot advises the Lord
Chamberlain what plays to ban.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.430
That's not news either, is it?

25:20.480 --> 25:22.030
Well, it is, actually.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.870
Well, all right, you probably
only found that out

25:24.920 --> 25:28.040
after you'd put your insider into
the Lord Chamberlain's office.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.790
I'd suggest you spend
less time on farces

25:33.840 --> 25:36.190
and study a thriller or two, Mr Duke.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.310
Learn to cover your tracks.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.830
Telephoning Bishop Talbot
yesterday and mocking him,

25:40.880 --> 25:43.020
that was a bit of a clue.

25:43.390 --> 25:44.390
What is all this?

25:44.440 --> 25:46.870
Your insider found out
about Bishop Talbot

25:46.920 --> 25:49.310
persuading the Lord Chamberlain
to pull your show.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.470
And that is why you wanted revenge.

25:51.520 --> 25:54.150
You spun the lie about
paying for St George

25:54.200 --> 25:55.790
to lure Talbot into the woods.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.590
And you would have
killed him as planned,

25:57.640 --> 25:59.270
had it not been for
your terrible aim.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.870
~ This is absurd.
~ Is it?

26:00.920 --> 26:02.720
Look, all right...

26:03.120 --> 26:05.870
I found out about that Bible-thumping
idiot trying to shaft me.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.990
I wanted revenge. But shooting him?

26:08.040 --> 26:12.150
Inspector, in my career, I've made
real enemies, proper enemies,

26:12.200 --> 26:14.670
men I have genuinely wanted dead.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.080
Do you think I would risk the noose
for a paper bag like the bishop?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.470
Um, Lady Felicia...

26:25.520 --> 26:26.720
Yes?

26:28.240 --> 26:31.070
Er, Mrs McCarthy, Sid and I
are about to take our seats.

26:31.120 --> 26:32.750
Of course.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.710
But Natasha's lost her scarf.
It's complete chaos back here.

26:35.760 --> 26:41.150
Why couldn't the Inspector have waited until
after first night to have arrested Bentley?

26:41.200 --> 26:42.940
~ Can I help?
~ Yes.

26:46.360 --> 26:47.960
Ah! Found it!

26:52.800 --> 26:55.470
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
act one beginners, please.

26:55.520 --> 26:57.720
Miss Ferango, Mr Redhill...

27:04.880 --> 27:06.750
Where have you been?

27:17.160 --> 27:19.350
Oh, my goodness! I thought
this was my door.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.430
I'm so sorry!

27:20.480 --> 27:23.750
It's quite all right.
Connecting rooms, eh?

27:23.800 --> 27:25.110
I'll...

27:25.160 --> 27:27.870
Sorry. Can I just say, I think
you have a smashing set of clubs.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.470
LAUGHTER

27:29.520 --> 27:30.630
Thank you.

27:30.680 --> 27:34.000
Actually, my coach tells me
I have a wonderful grip too.

27:38.200 --> 27:41.300
I'm sure your all-round
stroke play is excellent.

27:42.320 --> 27:43.550
What's your handicap?

27:43.600 --> 27:46.630
I have a weakness for
chocolate. And married men.

27:46.680 --> 27:48.070
I see...

27:48.120 --> 27:51.630
Would you care for some Black
Forest gateau? My wife made it.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.480
LAUGHTER

27:55.680 --> 27:57.240
APPLAUSE

27:59.560 --> 28:03.070
Oh, poor Harry! Is the
pain still unbearable?

28:03.120 --> 28:06.270
I'm afraid so. Though there are moments
when it's merely relentless.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.870
LAUGHTER

28:07.920 --> 28:09.230
Oh, darling...

28:09.280 --> 28:10.550
Harry?

28:11.840 --> 28:14.870
My wife! For the first time
in her life, she's back early!

28:14.920 --> 28:15.910
LAUGHTER

28:15.960 --> 28:16.950
KNOCKING

28:17.000 --> 28:18.320
Harry!

28:19.550 --> 28:20.550
Go!

28:20.600 --> 28:21.940
LAUGHTER

28:23.400 --> 28:26.200
~ The cleaner must have locked it!
~ What?!

28:27.120 --> 28:28.310
KNOCKING

28:28.360 --> 28:30.230
Harry! Open the door!

28:30.280 --> 28:31.310
KNOCKING

28:31.360 --> 28:35.400
Madam, this is the hotel's
rodent control squad.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.950
We've had reports
of rats in the room.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.940
Please, bear with us.

28:42.240 --> 28:43.710
Madame...?

28:48.760 --> 28:50.230
She's gone!

28:51.800 --> 28:53.400
Oh, darling...

28:54.320 --> 28:55.470
You're a genius!

28:55.520 --> 28:57.040
APPLAUSE

29:01.600 --> 29:03.540
Well, cheers! Cheers!

29:04.560 --> 29:07.270
Well done. Absolutely
brilliant performance.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.830
I particularly loved the first half.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.880
Oh, thank you so much.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.950
Convincing performance.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.110
Thank you.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.430
In the confessional, I mean.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.790
Why did you kill Davies?

29:20.840 --> 29:23.510
And why did you warn me of your plan?

29:25.520 --> 29:28.390
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.270
Father...

29:30.320 --> 29:33.910
Peter wants us both to join him in
the bar for a celebratory glass.

29:33.960 --> 29:35.360
Or three.

29:37.270 --> 29:38.270
I may be persuaded.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.990
Oh, marvellous.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.380
But, on the other hand...

29:47.560 --> 29:49.790
.. I may need to save my stamina.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.200
~ Early-morning mass.
~ Shame.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.940
Glowing reviews, I'm sure.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.520
Er, the door was open.

30:20.560 --> 30:24.660
Is hiding in a lady's dressing room
normal behaviour for a priest?

30:26.400 --> 30:30.360
You played a nun masquerading
as a plantation owner.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.790
Sure you were very good.

30:34.840 --> 30:38.840
But there is another detail in
the credits which interests me.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.230
Temporary wardrobe mistress,

30:42.280 --> 30:43.880
Ethel Davies.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.750
I imagine that a leading lady

30:46.800 --> 30:49.900
has to trust her wardrobe
mistress absolutely.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.040
After all, she makes
you look the part.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.600
And although she was with you for...

30:56.960 --> 30:58.150
A few weeks?

30:58.200 --> 31:00.600
.. I imagine you got very close.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.960
So close that you shared your
deepest, darkest secrets.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.400
Which is how you found
out that she was also...

31:10.000 --> 31:12.440
.. cruelly betrayed by a man.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.310
Natasha...

31:15.360 --> 31:17.160
you killed Davies.

31:18.480 --> 31:21.280
But I believe you acted
out of empathy.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.830
Can I trust you, Father?

31:24.880 --> 31:26.080
Yes.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.790
Can you take my confession here?

31:30.840 --> 31:32.040
Yes.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.000
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

31:43.280 --> 31:46.480
It has been four days since
my last confession.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.590
My uncle...

31:56.560 --> 31:59.500
.. he took away from
me everything I had...

32:00.240 --> 32:02.380
.. everything I believed.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.300
Coming back, after all these
years, I felt it all again.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.590
The anger.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.800
When Ethel told me what
her husband had done...

32:15.400 --> 32:17.710
.. how he had not just
stolen her money,

32:17.760 --> 32:20.560
but every drop of love
from her heart...

32:21.040 --> 32:23.180
.. I had to ease her pain.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.820
But I have regretted
it every minute since.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.470
I thought it would help me...

32:33.040 --> 32:34.780
.. bury a demon.

32:36.280 --> 32:38.280
I now have a new demon.

32:38.680 --> 32:41.220
Why did you warn me of your plans?

32:43.120 --> 32:45.630
I hoped you would throw
the police off the scent.

32:45.680 --> 32:49.790
By making it seem that
the bishop was the target?

32:49.840 --> 32:51.240
Yes.

32:52.240 --> 32:56.040
But you knew that I could tell
nobody about what you told me.

32:56.120 --> 32:58.520
I believed you would find a way.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.560
Oh, Father, I have been such a fool.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.670
You can still gain God's forgiveness.

33:04.720 --> 33:10.200
But He will only forgive if He knows
that you are truly repentant.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.310
I want this torment to end.

33:13.360 --> 33:17.160
Then you must take
responsibility for your crime.

33:19.720 --> 33:20.830
I'll be hanged...

33:20.880 --> 33:22.230
If you go to the police yourself,

33:22.280 --> 33:25.220
then I believe the church
will be lenient.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.550
But if they come to you...

33:29.600 --> 33:32.440
Natasha, you must do the right thing.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.110
Peter's worried sick Natasha isn't
going to be back for the matinee.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.590
I fear she may be gone
longer than that.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.390
But Natasha doesn't
have an understudy.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.510
She never, ever misses a performance.

33:46.560 --> 33:47.960
Father...

33:48.640 --> 33:49.750
Inspector.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.070
Natasha's just given
us a sworn statement.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.190
I see.

33:53.240 --> 33:56.440
She claims that you told
her who killed Davies.

33:56.680 --> 33:59.350
Then she has fooled me a second time.

34:00.320 --> 34:03.320
Is she right? That Bentley
confessed to you?

34:05.560 --> 34:08.560
Father Brown, is Bentley
Duke the killer or not?

34:11.760 --> 34:12.989
Right...

34:13.040 --> 34:14.350
You leave me no alternative

34:14.400 --> 34:16.790
but to continue this
conversation at the station.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.840
Get in the car, please.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.260
WHISTLE

34:29.239 --> 34:33.230
TANNOY: The train departing from
platform two is the 12.50,

34:33.280 --> 34:36.080
calling at all stations
to Cirencester.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.389
I think you're right, Inspector.

34:48.440 --> 34:51.030
I think Davies was
the intended target.

34:51.080 --> 34:54.830
According to Natasha, Bentley Duke
confessed the murder to you.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.160
And you sat on that while he roamed
free and Ethel Davies grieved.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.620
I had no idea Bentley
Duke was a Catholic.

35:03.080 --> 35:06.380
Your precious seal of the
confessional is a disgrace!

35:07.040 --> 35:08.990
Nothing more than a
licence for criminals

35:09.040 --> 35:11.910
to feel good about their
crimes and escape justice!

35:11.960 --> 35:15.560
And yet you think I broke the
seal of the confessional...

35:15.880 --> 35:17.480
.. to Natasha?

35:17.920 --> 35:19.590
So, you're calling Natasha a liar?

35:19.640 --> 35:22.950
Bentley Duke could have gone back
to the bishop and finished the job.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.230
Would you have been happy having
a second murder on your conscience?

35:26.280 --> 35:28.070
Two murders...

35:28.120 --> 35:29.790
Yes! That's it!

35:30.160 --> 35:31.500
What is?

35:32.880 --> 35:35.320
The two hands... It's a pact!

35:37.040 --> 35:39.440
It's a way of disguising motive.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.270
That's simple...

35:41.320 --> 35:43.260
That's so, so clever.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.510
12.50 to Cirencester...

35:45.560 --> 35:49.550
Inspector, there's another murder
about to be committed in an hour.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.830
We need to stop it.

35:50.880 --> 35:52.030
This won't work, Father.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.870
If we take your fastest car...

35:53.920 --> 35:56.030
I mean, distracting
me with this nonsense.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.750
But we need to leave now!

35:57.800 --> 36:00.900
Sorry, sir. The
Superintendent's on the telephone.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.230
Sit down!

36:05.280 --> 36:07.420
You're not going anywhere.

36:23.960 --> 36:27.520
Lady Felicia, could your motorcar
beat a railway train?

36:28.600 --> 36:30.270
Let's find out.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.900
Cirencester, please, Sid.

37:11.320 --> 37:13.110
Can we stop here, please, Sid?

37:13.160 --> 37:14.630
Thank you.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.350
Ethel!

37:21.400 --> 37:23.150
Leave me be, Father.

37:23.200 --> 37:26.140
Ethel, I know about your
pact with Natasha.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.680
Father Brown?

37:30.480 --> 37:33.220
Go back in the house,
please, Winston.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.310
~ What's all this about?
~ Just do as I say.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.070
Go back into the house.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.830
What in the devil's
name is going on here?

37:38.880 --> 37:41.680
Get inside. Before
this woman kills you.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.140
Let her try.

37:49.360 --> 37:50.470
Ethel!

37:50.520 --> 37:52.070
I'm a woman of my word, Father.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.870
Natasha's done her bit for me.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.030
Natasha?

37:55.080 --> 37:56.950
You ruined that poor girl's life.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.230
You wretched, evil man.
You'll rot in hell!

37:59.280 --> 38:00.270
Dear God...!

38:00.320 --> 38:02.110
Ethel, I know how
angry you must feel,

38:02.160 --> 38:04.750
but two wrongs do not make a right.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.670
I must not let her down.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.520
Father, please...!

38:10.320 --> 38:11.830
Revenge is mine.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.220
I will repay, sayeth the Lord.

38:16.680 --> 38:19.080
Be not overcome by evil...

38:20.160 --> 38:22.430
.. but overcome evil by good.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.510
Oh, Natasha...

38:28.560 --> 38:30.030
Forgive me!

38:30.640 --> 38:32.640
I'm calling the police!

38:32.760 --> 38:34.870
Well, if you think that's right.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.790
She needs locking up!

38:36.840 --> 38:38.240
Probably.

38:38.840 --> 38:41.910
But then, we all do things
we regret later...

38:41.960 --> 38:43.560
.. don't we...

38:44.600 --> 38:46.070
.. Winston?

39:05.280 --> 39:07.230
HUMS

39:07.280 --> 39:09.830
You know, some people say I
have my head in the clouds.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.240
Hmmmm....

39:14.440 --> 39:17.670
Ethel has chosen not
to kill your uncle

39:17.720 --> 39:19.860
and has handed herself in.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.670
How dare you interfere!

39:21.720 --> 39:23.630
~ Where are you going?
~ To kill him myself!

39:23.680 --> 39:26.220
Ethel cannot protect you for long.

39:27.080 --> 39:28.790
She's not an actress.

39:28.840 --> 39:31.030
So I can't afford to waste
time talking to you.

39:31.080 --> 39:33.950
The police will go to your
uncle's. They will find you.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.600
And then what?

39:37.200 --> 39:41.360
Why did you tell me you were
planning to kill Bishop Talbot?

39:43.440 --> 39:46.000
Because you were my uncle's excuse.

39:47.520 --> 39:50.760
God was forgiving him in that
confessional box, through you.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.710
That's what he told me.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.880
You knew exactly what he was doing,
yet you did nothing to help.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.150
So I set you a trap.

40:00.350 --> 40:01.350
Of course.

40:01.400 --> 40:05.270
What would you do if you heard that
your precious boss was in danger?

40:05.320 --> 40:06.660
Answer?

40:07.360 --> 40:11.400
Risk your life saving him, where
you had abandoned me to evil.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.830
You are the greatest hypocrite
of them all, Father Brown.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.470
I came this close to shooting
you in those woods.

40:18.520 --> 40:21.880
And to hide my hatred from you has been
the greatest acting challenge of my life.

40:23.270 --> 40:24.270
I understand.

40:24.320 --> 40:27.190
You won't deny my uncle
confessed to you?

40:27.880 --> 40:29.880
I cannot say anything.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.480
And you understand why.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.160
He didn't confess.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.600
Father, I will take your silence
to mean that my uncle lied to me.

40:44.560 --> 40:47.300
He did not tell you
what he was doing.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.520
You did not sit by while
evil was committed.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.780
Then I have misjudged
you. I am sorry.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.600
Good.

41:03.800 --> 41:06.600
You can still receive
God's forgiveness.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.200
Do you want your uncle punished?

41:12.200 --> 41:13.990
With all my heart.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.240
Then go to the police and
tell them everything.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.070
Mr Duke...

41:25.120 --> 41:26.230
Felicia. Peter.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.230
~ Good to have you back.
~ Yes.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.350
Pair of liars.

41:29.400 --> 41:32.440
You'd much rather Natasha was here
and I was rotting away in a cell.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.430
Don't look so glum. I'm
thrilled to be back!

41:36.480 --> 41:38.390
Even if it is to close the show.

41:38.440 --> 41:39.990
Mr Duke...

41:40.040 --> 41:42.710
I wonder if you would consider me,

41:42.760 --> 41:44.630
in Natasha's place?

41:48.640 --> 41:51.180
Well, that's very sporting of you.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.150
I mean, in the play.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.670
Oh...

41:54.720 --> 41:55.710
Really?

41:55.760 --> 41:58.070
I know her lines. I
know where she stands.

41:58.120 --> 42:00.310
Well, yes, I'm a couple
of years older than her,

42:00.360 --> 42:02.630
but if you and Peter will
just give me the chance

42:02.680 --> 42:04.750
to show what I could do.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.280
~ Act one, scene four?
~ Fine.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.740
All right, when you're
ready, my dear.

42:34.520 --> 42:35.990
Is that...?

42:52.280 --> 42:54.910
Must have been a tough
decision for them.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.390
Very difficult.

42:56.440 --> 42:59.070
~ Are you all right, Lady Felicia?
~ No.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.560
Brown!

43:02.240 --> 43:05.230
The delightful Mrs McCarthy
insisted I'd find you here.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.480
Word?

43:09.040 --> 43:11.470
Have they got the right
person this time?

43:11.520 --> 43:15.020
~ The right person?
~ Well, the actress. Is she my assassin?

43:16.040 --> 43:19.140
Well, just nod. Or shake
your head. Do something.

43:19.920 --> 43:21.030
What do you want?

43:21.080 --> 43:23.150
A new set of hymn books?

43:23.920 --> 43:26.320
A television in the presbytery?

43:26.640 --> 43:27.980
Tell me!

43:30.080 --> 43:34.430
I would never be able to look
you in the eye again, My Lord.

43:34.480 --> 43:36.040
You confounded man!
