00:34.203 --> 00:36.920
Ugh! I'm covered in newbs.

00:43.555 --> 00:44.950
__

00:45.037 --> 00:49.862
- Aah! I've got hunger cranks.
- Hmm? Oh, yes!

00:49.949 --> 00:54.276
- That's very interesting.
- Kim Kil Whan.

01:00.644 --> 01:03.035
Rrrrraahh!

01:03.169 --> 01:05.588
Mom, when are we gonna eat?!
I'm goin' nuts!

01:05.810 --> 01:07.197
__

01:07.284 --> 01:08.653
Seriously, mom,

01:08.740 --> 01:11.292
dad's already three hours late
with the food!

01:11.379 --> 01:12.608
You hush, junior!

01:12.695 --> 01:15.396
You know
dad's a wonderful cook.

01:15.483 --> 01:18.438
Viola, when's the last time
you even heard from dad?

01:18.525 --> 01:21.668
Oh, you know.
Dad is... Distractible.

01:21.755 --> 01:23.715
Ah, ha, hah! "Distractible!"

01:23.802 --> 01:25.692
Yeah, I love dad and everything,

01:25.779 --> 01:27.569
but he's only ever met me twice.

01:27.656 --> 01:29.830
Charlie, Viola, Tv,
Jake Jr, Kim Kil Whan.

01:29.917 --> 01:32.534
__

01:32.629 --> 01:33.814
Whoo!

01:34.440 --> 01:36.911
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

01:36.998 --> 01:39.535
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
We're real late!

01:39.622 --> 01:41.004
Happy birthday, puppies!

01:41.091 --> 01:43.391
Okay, so, putting it out there...
I didn't remember to

01:43.478 --> 01:45.130
bring you guys any
birthday presents,

01:45.217 --> 01:49.118
but I did bring lunch!
It's macaroni salad.

01:49.205 --> 01:52.177
Dad, you're beautiful!

01:52.264 --> 01:55.037
Dad! We have new
business to discuss.

01:55.124 --> 01:57.357
Happy birthday, Kim Kil Whan!

01:57.444 --> 01:59.554
Birthdays are old business.

02:02.282 --> 02:03.889
Whoa, ho, hoh, neat.

02:03.976 --> 02:06.167
Um, well,
how are things goin', son?

02:06.254 --> 02:08.494
"Things"?
"Things" have switched hands.

02:08.965 --> 02:10.723
- I get it.
- Dad, when I say that

02:10.811 --> 02:12.377
things have switched
hands, I mean to say that

02:12.445 --> 02:13.779
things you have
previously claimed

02:13.847 --> 02:16.009
ownership of have
transferred from your hands

02:16.077 --> 02:18.376
to my hands, in that...

02:18.958 --> 02:21.807
- I bought your tree house.
- What?!

02:21.894 --> 02:23.733
What... the deed to
your tree house.

02:23.820 --> 02:25.834
How... acquired
through legal trade.

02:25.921 --> 02:27.650
From whom...
the deed's previous owner,

02:27.737 --> 02:29.861
Marceline
the Vampire Queen.

02:30.697 --> 02:32.983
In exchange for one lunatic bass.

02:35.154 --> 02:37.386
When... effective immediately.

02:37.473 --> 02:39.404
But, son, why?

02:39.491 --> 02:41.411
We will convene at the property.

02:51.021 --> 02:52.953
Sorry I'm late. Okay.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.273
So, as the deed holder of
this tree house,

02:55.360 --> 02:56.535
I am now your landlord.

02:56.622 --> 02:58.594
The first thing
I'm going to have to do

02:58.681 --> 03:01.799
is assess your treasure room.

03:01.904 --> 03:04.622
But, son, I'm your pop.

03:04.709 --> 03:08.279
What would your mother say,
doing this to your poor pip-pop!

03:08.366 --> 03:10.928
I'm sorry, dad.
Deeds don't bleed.

03:14.076 --> 03:18.901
Okay, son, get ready to be
glitter-stunned by all this treasu...

03:18.988 --> 03:21.906
Oh, yeah! We spent all of it.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.917
All we have left are these
vintage photos

03:24.004 --> 03:25.580
I got at the flea market.

03:25.915 --> 03:27.533
They're interesting!

03:27.673 --> 03:29.682
Woof. All right,

03:29.769 --> 03:32.593
so, I guess this is the apartment
the two of you can afford.

03:32.740 --> 03:34.437
It's a ladder.

03:35.681 --> 03:38.799
Yeah? Yeah. Send them on over.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.940
Sorry about that.
Anyway, as you can see,

03:42.027 --> 03:43.870
this beauty offers
direct first and

03:43.957 --> 03:46.060
second-floor access,
superb craftsmanship,

03:46.147 --> 03:48.344
and et cetera. I...
Suppose you're familiar.

03:48.487 --> 03:51.962
- Yes, Finn?
- Yeah, when do we get our house back?

03:52.049 --> 03:54.911
What?
Excuse me.

03:56.629 --> 03:58.767
- Good afternoon.
- Yes, right this way.

03:58.854 --> 04:01.126
I've got 37 available units
to show in this building,

04:01.213 --> 04:02.505
so we're gonna want
to get right to it.

04:02.592 --> 04:04.130
Please, step inside. There we go.

04:04.217 --> 04:05.655
- Is that everyone?
- Good, good!

04:05.742 --> 04:08.131
Please make your way upstairs,
and we'll begin the tour.

04:08.655 --> 04:11.654
And, you two, go ahead and
make yourselves at home.

04:11.741 --> 04:13.642
Rent's due on the 1st.
No overnight guests.

04:13.729 --> 04:17.023
Oh, and flush once after you boom-boom
but before you start using the T.P.,

04:17.110 --> 04:20.385
and then once more in the middle of using
the T.P. if you're going to use a lot.

04:20.471 --> 04:24.346
It's... easier on the pipes. Okay,
call me if you need me.

04:34.065 --> 04:37.217
Hey, Finn,
I'm real sorry about this.

04:37.304 --> 04:39.618
Somehow, I feel like
it's kind of my fault.

04:39.705 --> 04:42.046
Nah, man!
It's really not so bad.

04:42.133 --> 04:43.855
Let's just sleep on it tonight.

04:45.274 --> 04:49.768
- You're gonna sleep like that?
- Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid.

04:52.628 --> 04:54.922
I promise I'll
work this thi...

04:55.009 --> 04:58.556
Gee, but it's great to
be back home, eh, Mr. B.?

04:58.684 --> 05:02.719
Yeah. I can't wait
to wash my gross, fat butt.

05:04.090 --> 05:07.251
Ugh!

05:16.482 --> 05:20.505
Oh, oh, holy cow! Oh!
Oh, boy, please hurry.

05:20.592 --> 05:23.418
Yes, he's inside my
apartment right now.

05:23.505 --> 05:26.191
- Oh, I'm so scared.
- Hey, buddy, you okay?

05:26.278 --> 05:29.671
- Glob, now there's two of 'em!
- I just feel like if we're patient,

05:29.758 --> 05:32.585
this whole thing will work itself out
before you know it.

05:33.755 --> 05:37.799
See, man?
Help is on the way.

05:37.886 --> 05:41.058
Man, can I tell you something?

05:41.145 --> 05:43.391
I don't even know
what's going on, here.

05:43.478 --> 05:45.688
I mean, like, what
the heck is a deed?

05:45.775 --> 05:48.291
How come he can buy our
house when it's our house and

05:48.378 --> 05:51.237
Marceline gave it
to us and we live there?

05:51.324 --> 05:52.931
And now we're arrested?

05:53.018 --> 05:55.511
This is crazy! It's crazy!

05:56.722 --> 05:58.150
Man, don't you know?

05:58.237 --> 05:59.417
The laws ain't made to help

05:59.504 --> 06:01.734
- earthy cats like us.
- They're not?

06:01.821 --> 06:06.310
Nah, man! Listen.
Here on our planet, back in the old days...

06:06.471 --> 06:08.511
Back in the real old days.

06:08.598 --> 06:10.808
It was just every man
for hisself,

06:10.895 --> 06:13.829
scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin'
for the good stuff,

06:13.916 --> 06:16.568
the greenest valleys,
and scrat-scroblin'.

06:16.655 --> 06:19.848
And the strongest,
meanest men got the best stuff.

06:19.935 --> 06:22.799
They got the green valleys
and were like, "the rest of you,

06:22.886 --> 06:24.655
y'all scrats get sand."

06:24.742 --> 06:27.031
And that's
when they made the laws, you see.

06:27.118 --> 06:29.459
Once the strong guys
got it how they liked it,

06:29.546 --> 06:31.392
they said
"this is fair now.

06:31.479 --> 06:35.712
This is the law." Once they were
winning, they changed the rules up.

06:35.826 --> 06:40.299
- Whoa, just like Kim Kil Whan.
- Hey, good news, fellas.

06:40.386 --> 06:42.917
Your bail's paid.
You're free to go.

06:43.056 --> 06:44.827
- Ah, hah! That's awesome!
- Yeah!

06:44.914 --> 06:48.040
- Yeahhh! Awesome!
- Yeah, real "awesome."

06:48.127 --> 06:52.456
Hey, Kim Kil Whan! Aw, buddy,
I knew you'd come around.

06:52.543 --> 06:56.322
Fathers and sons, man.
That's that real thick chowder.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.645
- What's this?
- This is a bill for the bail I just paid.

07:00.732 --> 07:04.738
Oh! You're really in
it deep, here dad.

07:04.825 --> 07:08.514
It's time for you to get real.
Get a job. No more games.

07:08.601 --> 07:12.717
Come on, son, just let me
do the... Lah blah blah...

07:15.003 --> 07:19.332
- Aah! Man, where did I go wrong?
- I don't know, but I'm not tryin'

07:19.419 --> 07:23.180
to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so
let's just get a bunch of scroot together

07:23.267 --> 07:26.462
and buy our house back.
Then you two can hash it out later.

07:26.617 --> 07:30.750
Yeah, you're right. So, wanna
rob a bank or somethin'?

07:30.837 --> 07:35.117
Well, actually, I was thinking
maybe Kim Kil Whan was right.

07:35.204 --> 07:39.338
- Maybe we should get jobs or somethin'.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

07:39.425 --> 07:43.912
Oh, no, wait! I just remembered
I buried a ton of gold in the front yard!

07:44.017 --> 07:45.695
Yes!

07:45.997 --> 07:49.328
Oh, yes, yes, absolutely.
Small pets are allowed with an

07:49.415 --> 07:53.494
- additional deposit.
- Excellent.

07:55.396 --> 07:58.216
- <i>Watch it!</i>
- Excuse me.

07:58.320 --> 08:02.696
- Almost got it.
- Hey, son! I'm glad you're here.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.497
Bad news, ya scrat!
We're buying our house back!

08:05.584 --> 08:09.678
- Oh, yeah? With what?
- With this! - Yeah!

08:09.799 --> 08:14.444
Oh, I see. With the gold you dug out
of my lawn, which is therefore mine.

08:15.494 --> 08:19.337
Now, since I have a job,
I must be going. Ciao!

08:20.113 --> 08:24.097
- And fill in that hole.
- I'm gonna be frank, here.

08:24.242 --> 08:27.790
- Your son's a real-time jingle-blaster.
- I know, I know.

08:28.667 --> 08:32.679
Kim Kil Whan's a real out-loud
flim-flammer, and that's okay, I guess,

08:32.767 --> 08:35.437
but why, why, would he do
this to his pip-plop-plop?

08:35.524 --> 08:38.558
Oh, wait! You know,
like, like, maybe he's

08:38.645 --> 08:40.615
got a secret problem he
can't tell us about,

08:40.729 --> 08:43.404
like with mob goons...
Like, like gambling

08:43.491 --> 08:46.077
- debts or something.
- Oh, that's it! You're right!

08:46.164 --> 08:49.590
If we help him out of his secret jam,
he won't need our money anymore.

08:49.677 --> 08:52.225
Look, there he goes now. Come on,

08:52.312 --> 08:54.940
let's follow him to the mob goons!

08:55.442 --> 08:58.585
You sure this is right, Jake?
I've never seen this place before.

08:58.672 --> 09:02.139
- Looks like a fairy tale.
- Yeah, man, the nose knows.

09:02.226 --> 09:06.005
I smelled him go in there...
And then I smelled him go up there.

09:06.875 --> 09:11.664
Whoa! Kim Kil Whan is rich,
like wow, like, hello, what?

09:11.751 --> 09:14.579
But if he doesn't need our
money, what does he need?

09:15.121 --> 09:17.840
Throw pebbles at the
glass to get his attention.

09:22.702 --> 09:25.471
Hey, son! - Dad?

09:25.558 --> 09:28.083
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

09:28.170 --> 09:31.263
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. I never
even looked for a job.

09:31.350 --> 09:32.869
- Really?
- I was thinking about

09:32.956 --> 09:34.252
you buyin' our tree house.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.700
I figured out that
you don't need our money,

09:36.787 --> 09:40.405
so maybe you'd consider
my counteroffer...

09:41.432 --> 09:42.926
Father love!

09:43.013 --> 09:45.984
I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you,

09:46.071 --> 09:49.027
I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you,

09:49.114 --> 09:52.437
I love you, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you, I love you,

09:52.524 --> 09:55.122
I love you, I love
you, I love you.

09:55.209 --> 09:59.725
Come on, open it!
It's an ocarina.

09:59.812 --> 10:01.793
- I made it for you.
- Oh!

10:01.923 --> 10:05.955
Whenever you play it, you'll be
reminded of your pep-pant's love.

10:06.042 --> 10:07.273
Thanks, dad.

10:10.002 --> 10:14.323
Yeah, it's not hollow. I made
the holes with the back end of a pencil.

10:16.733 --> 10:20.767
I suppose I could accept
the ocarina as legal trade.

10:21.126 --> 10:23.376
The tree house is yours, dad.

10:26.604 --> 10:34.302
<i>- Okay. Take care, dad. I'll call.
- I'll call! Okay, bye, dad.</i>

10:34.389 --> 10:38.835
<i>- Later, son! Yeah!
- Yeah, all right! Daddin'!</i>

10:42.259 --> 10:47.011
- Sweetheart, how did it go?
- Eh, all right, I guess.

10:47.098 --> 10:50.420
I don't know.
He still lives the life of a child.

10:50.507 --> 10:53.517
I mean, it's his choice,
but I really thought

10:53.604 --> 10:56.269
if he got a job and moved
out of that tree house,

10:56.356 --> 11:00.544
- it could have put some fire under him.
- Aw, I'm sorry, sweets.

11:00.631 --> 11:03.495
No, I think I was wrong
about dad.

11:03.582 --> 11:05.067
I think he's good.
