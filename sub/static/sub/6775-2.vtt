HOW LUCKY
CAN ONE GUY BE

01:52.360 --> 01:55.796
I KISSED HER
AND SHE KISSED ME

01:55.800 --> 01:58.155
LIKE THE FELLA
ONCE SAID...

01:58.160 --> 02:00.355
YOU CAN HAVE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.056
IT'S YOURS
FOR THE TAKING.

02:03.060 --> 02:05.221
BUT WE'VE BEEN
CONDITIONED TO THINK

02:05.230 --> 02:07.721
THAT THIS ISN'T
FAIR SOMEHOW.

02:07.730 --> 02:09.652
THAT THAT'S TAKING
SOMETHING AWAY

02:09.660 --> 02:11.548
FROM SOMEONE
ELSE, RIGHT ?

02:11.560 --> 02:12.652
RIGHT.
RIGHT.

02:12.660 --> 02:13.991
WRONG.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.321

02:16.330 --> 02:18.525

02:31.360 --> 02:33.419

02:33.430 --> 02:35.250
HE TOLD ME THE FIRST
TIME WE WENT OUT

02:35.260 --> 02:36.818
HE WAS GOING
TO MARRY ME.

02:36.830 --> 02:38.889
IT WAS
UNBELIEVABLY
ROMANTIC

02:38.900 --> 02:42.222
AND NOW I HAVE
THIS BEAUTIFUL BABY.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.289

THAT'S WHAT
BEAUTY VISION IS.

02:44.300 --> 02:48.122

BREAKFAST ?

03:53.330 --> 03:55.389

04:07.600 --> 04:10.649

IS THE WIFE ?

04:10.660 --> 04:13.197
NO, NO, KEEP GOING,
KEEP GOING,

04:13.200 --> 04:15.725
I'M KINDA CURIOUS
AS TO HOW THIS WORKS.

04:22.260 --> 04:28.529
( radio playing )

04:32.300 --> 04:34.495
NO BREAKFAST ?

04:34.500 --> 04:36.718
WHY'D YOU LET ME
SLEEP SO LATE ?

04:36.730 --> 04:38.550
I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART
TO WAKE YOU UP.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.221
YOU LOOKED
SO RELAXED,

04:40.230 --> 04:42.152
WHICH I DON'T SEE
THAT OFI'EN.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.991
TODAY'S THE READING
OF DAD'S WILL.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.456
YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.

04:45.460 --> 04:47.519
IT'LL ALL BE OVER
REAL SOON.

04:47.530 --> 04:50.419
THANK YOU FOR
SLEEPING OVER.

04:50.430 --> 04:52.557
YOU SNORE.

04:52.560 --> 04:52.628
DON'T FORGET
ABOUT THE MEETING
TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.428
WARNER
YOU THINK
I'D MISS A MEETING

04:59.600 --> 05:01.898
YOU'LL LIKE THESE GUYS,
THEY'RE COOL.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.697
I'LL PICK YOU UP
AROUND SEVEN,

05:03.700 --> 05:05.349
WE'LL GRAB A BITE
TO EAT FIRST.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.850
CALL ME BEFORE
YOU HEAD OVER.

05:06.860 --> 05:08.657
SO YOU CAN WEASEL
YOUR WAY OUT OF IT ?

05:08.660 --> 05:11.891
I NEVER KNOW
WHEN I'M GONNA
HAVE TO WORK, KEITH.

05:11.900 --> 05:13.822
THIS IS A BUSY
TIME FOR US.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.889
A LOT OF PEOPLE HOLD ON
FOR ONE LAST CHRISTMAS

05:15.900 --> 05:17.720
AND THEN,
B'BYE.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.325
I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHIATSU
WAS MORE INTENSE THAN THIS.

05:23.330 --> 05:25.355
OH, IT'LL
GET THERE.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.499
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIND OUT

05:27.500 --> 05:29.491
WHERE YOU'RE
WOUNDED.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.899
WOUNDED ?

05:30.900 --> 05:33.050
I GOT STABBED
IN THE THIGH

05:33.060 --> 05:35.096
WITH A BIC PEN ONCE.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.455
I WASN'T
SPEAKING LITERALLY.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.692
AHH !

05:41.700 --> 05:43.793
OH, HERE'S
A GOOD ONE.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.496
OLD, BUT,

05:46.500 --> 05:49.594
RECENTLY REOPENED.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.591
YOU'RE SO
FULL OF SHIT.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.420
WELL, WE'RE
ALL WOUNDED.

05:53.430 --> 05:56.319
WE CARRY OUR WOUNDS AROUND
WITH US THROUGHOUT LIFE

05:58.900 --> 06:02.119
THINGS HAPPEN THAT LEAVE
A MARK IN SPACE, IN TIME.

06:02.130 --> 06:04.621
IN US.

06:07.630 --> 06:10.758
I'M SURE THIS IS ALL
VERY DEEP AND PROFOUND,

06:10.760 --> 06:13.888
BUT I GET ENOUGH
DEPTH AT HOME.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.349
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MY HAVEN AWAY FROM ALL THAT.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.694
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE ANYTHING.

06:45.330 --> 06:46.991
'MORNING, DAVE.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.349
AREN'T THOSE THE SAME
CLOTHES YOU HAD ON
YESTERDAY ?

06:51.360 --> 06:53.999
EVERYTHING I OWN
LOOKS ALIKE.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.821
I SENSE YOU'RE
NOT BEING COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH ME, DAVE.

06:56.830 --> 06:59.321
HAVE YOU CHANGED ANY
SINCE YOU WERE 14 ?

06:59.330 --> 07:02.390
HEY, I'M ALL FOR YOU
GETTING LAID, BELIEVE ME.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.849

07:16.100 --> 07:17.294
'MORNING.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.894
GO'I'I'A TRY THESE,
THEY'RE HYDROPONIC.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.219
GROWN IN WATER ?

07:21.230 --> 07:22.959
I KNOW THE GUY
WHO GROWS THEM,

07:22.960 --> 07:24.621
HE'S A BIG SUPPLIER
TO THE CO-OP.

07:24.630 --> 07:26.359
SO, MY PEACHES
ARE NO GOOD.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.918
WHAT ?

07:27.930 --> 07:29.329
NO, THEY'RE FINE.

07:37.060 --> 07:38.994
MR. HICKEY WANTS
US THERE ON TIME

07:39.000 --> 07:40.752
FOR THE READING
OF THE WILL.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.796
WE SHOULD ALL
GO IN THE SAME CAR.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.098
GREAT, I HAVE TO MISS
ANOTHER DAY OF SCHOOL ?

07:45.100 --> 07:47.455
WHAT AM I, LIKE SOME POOR,
KNOCKED UP, VICTORIAN WAIF

07:47.460 --> 07:49.428
WHO HAS TO STAY
HIDDEN FROM VIEW ?

07:49.430 --> 07:51.250
FINE, GO
TO SCHOOL.

07:51.260 --> 07:52.796
STAY OUT
ALL NIGHT,

07:52.800 --> 07:55.155
LIVE IN THE STREETS,
SEE IF I CARE.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.495
WAS SHE LIKE THIS
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP ?

08:02.500 --> 08:03.990
NO, NOT REALLY, BUT,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.321
SHE WAS WELL
ON HER WAY.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.528
'MORNING.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.454
YOU'RE LOOKING
QUITE SPIFFY IN
THAT SUIT, DAVE.

08:12.460 --> 08:13.825
THAT'S SO CLEVER,

08:13.830 --> 08:15.718
YOU'RE TALKING LIKE
THE COMPUTER IN THE MOVIE,

08:15.730 --> 08:17.027
WOW, YOU'RE FUNNY.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.419
HEY, HAVE A
HYDROPONIC RASPBERRY

08:19.430 --> 08:21.159
GROWN BY A GUY
NAMED GUNTHER

08:21.160 --> 08:22.957
WHO ONCE SLEPT
WITH STEVIE NICKS.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.756
EWW.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.422
SO, DAVE, ARE YOU GONNA
TELL US ABOUT HER ?

08:27.430 --> 08:28.852
WHO ?

08:28.860 --> 08:30.225
HE'S GOT
A FRIEND.

08:30.230 --> 08:32.152
HEY, ARE YOU AND
JENNIFER BACK TOGETHER ?

08:32.160 --> 08:33.297
NO.

08:33.300 --> 08:35.427
HAVE YOU MET
SOMEONE ELSE, DAVE ?

08:35.430 --> 08:36.749
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

08:36.760 --> 08:38.227
SOMEONE FROM
OUTSIDE YOUR POD ?

08:38.230 --> 08:39.527
SHUT UP, ASSHOLE.

08:39.530 --> 08:41.395
( doorbell )

08:41.400 --> 08:43.288
THAN K YOU,
CLAIRE.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.028
WHY ARE YOU
STILL HERE, ANYWAY ?

08:49.030 --> 08:50.998
WHY DON'T YOU GO
BACK TO SEATTLE ?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.627
BECAUSE I WOULD MISS
THE JOYFUL SENSE

08:52.630 --> 08:54.450
OF BELONGING
I GET HERE.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.888
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT KIND OF SERVICE
HE'D WANT.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.925
WELL, AT THIS SCALE,

09:11.930 --> 09:13.898
IT DEPENDS ON
WHO HE WAS,

09:13.900 --> 09:16.152
AND HOW HE
SAW HIMSELF.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.492
THE STATEMENT THAT
HE MADE WITH HIS LIFE.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.323
HE WAS, LIKE,
SO DYNAMIC.

09:24.330 --> 09:27.754
HE HAD HIS
OWN BUSINESS.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.489
BEAUTY VISION ?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.252
FROM THE INFOMERCIAL ?

09:31.260 --> 09:33.490
CHAN DLER
INVENTED IT.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.149
LARGE SCALE.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.254
I'LL ARRANGE VIEWINGS
FOR TOMORROW AND THE NEXT DAY.

09:38.260 --> 09:40.990
INTERMENT AT CEDAR HILL,
SERVICE FOR 200.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.619
NOW, WE SHOULD CHOOSE AN
APPROPRIATE RESTING VESSEL,

09:45.630 --> 09:48.895
ONE THAT BEFITS A MAN
OF HIS STATURE.

10:01.730 --> 10:04.426
MAY I ASK WHAT KIND OF CAR
YOUR HUSBAND PREFERRED ?

10:05.900 --> 10:08.653
HE DRIVES A BMW.

10:08.660 --> 10:10.525
DO YOU KNOW
WHICH MODEL ?

10:10.530 --> 10:12.998
THE BIGGEST,
FASTEST ONE.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.491
I RECOMMEND
THE TITAN SERIES.

10:16.660 --> 10:19.026
SOLID MAHOGANY,
PAN FINISHED,

10:19.030 --> 10:20.622
WITH BU RWOOD ACCENTS,

10:20.630 --> 10:23.190
THE SAME WOOD USED IN
LUXURY AUTOMOBILE INTERIORS.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.656
IT LOOKS EXPENSIVE.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.799
$9,000...

10:26.800 --> 10:29.758
IT'S MORE THAN
JUST A CASKET,

10:29.760 --> 10:33.196
IT'S A TRIBUTE,
REALLY.

10:34.330 --> 10:35.888
OKAY.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.391
ARE WE FINISHED ?

10:38.400 --> 10:41.426
A MAJOR CREDIT CARD
TO GET US STARTED.

RECOURSE HERE ?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.593
RECOURSE ?

11:50.600 --> 11:53.489
YOUR ENTIRE COLLEGE
EDUCATION IS PROVIDED FOR.

GET ANYTHING.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.797
YOU GET EDUCATION,

NOT EVERYONE GETS.

WANNA GO TO COLLEGE ?

12:01.500 --> 12:03.058
WELL, YOU NEED IT
THESE DAYS.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.755
NOT JUST TO SUCCEED,

RATIONALIZATION,

12:08.100 --> 12:09.954

PLEASE.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.258
SHOULD YOU DECIDE
NOT TO GO TO COLLEGE

12:12.260 --> 12:13.898
THE MONEY WILL BECOME
AVAILABLE TO YOU

12:13.900 --> 12:15.492
WHEN YOU'RE 25.

12:16.700 --> 12:19.828
SO, THIS IS LIKE BLACKMAIL
FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE.

WHAT IN THE HELL
WAS DAD THINKING ?

12:23.900 --> 12:25.856

( Claire )
MOM GETS HALF A MILLION
IN LIFE INSURANCE,

12:30.530 --> 12:31.827
WHICH IS
COMPLETELY FAIR,

12:31.830 --> 12:33.491
BUT I HAVE THESE
HUGE STRINGS ATTACHED ?

12:33.500 --> 12:34.489
( Ruth )
LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT WHAT'S FAIR.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.297
MOM, YOU CAN
HAVE MY HALF.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.097
NO, YOUR FATHER
KNEW EXACTLY WHAT
HE WAS DOING.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.829
HE WANTED
EVERYBODY HAPPY,
AND WE WILL BE HAPPY.

12:39.830 --> 12:41.923
I GUESS WHAT I WANT
IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT.

12:41.930 --> 12:44.421
DAVE, LISTEN, I THINK
THIS IS ALL WRONG,

12:44.430 --> 12:45.454
IT SHOULD BE YOURS.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.688
OR YOURS AND MOMS.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.622
I REALLY DON'T WANNA
DISCUSS IT NOW.

12:48.630 --> 12:50.825
MAYBE I'LL MOVE
TO FLORIDA.

12:50.830 --> 12:52.889
THAT'S RIDICULOUS, MOM,
AND IT'S NOT HELPING.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.492
( Ruth )
YOU'RE ALL ADULTS,

12:54.500 --> 12:56.149

13:09.560 --> 13:12.495
HEAD SPLIT OPEN,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.923
HAIR EXTENSIONS TO
COVER THE STITCHES,

13:14.930 --> 13:16.295
MAYBE.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.450

13:33.900 --> 13:35.925
WELL, JUST CRANK UP
THE PINK SPOTS OVER HER CASKET.

13:35.930 --> 13:37.898
DAVID, THE WOMAN

13:37.900 --> 13:40.255
I DON'T AIRBRUSH HER,
THE FAMILY'S GONNA FREAK.

13:40.260 --> 13:41.591
YOU WANNA PUT HER
OUT LIKE THAT,

13:41.600 --> 13:43.659
THEN TAKE MY NAME
OFF THE CERTIFICATE.

13:43.660 --> 13:45.753
( engine rewing )

13:45.760 --> 13:48.092
NATE, I NEED YOU
TO PICK UP A BODY

13:48.100 --> 13:50.318
AT BAY BREEZE
NURSING HOME.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.854
UHH...

13:51.860 --> 13:53.589
I DON'T REALLY
KNOW HOW.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.625
YOU PUT 'EM ON A GURNEY,
PUT THE GURNEY IN THE CAR,

13:55.630 --> 13:57.598
BRING IT HOME,

13:57.600 --> 13:59.090
TAKE THE ELEVATOR
TO THE BASEMENT,
PUT 'EM IN THE FREEZER.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.556
YOU THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE THAT ?

14:00.560 --> 14:02.289
YOU OWN HALF
THE BUSINESS NOW,

14:02.300 --> 14:04.222
START PU LLING
YOUR WEIGHT.

14:04.230 --> 14:05.595
( honking )

14:05.600 --> 14:08.057
"NEWSFLASH",
OTHER PEOPLE EXIST !

14:15.800 --> 14:18.826
HEY, GIVE ME 20 MINUTES,
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

14:18.830 --> 14:19.956
THAN KS.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.495
SO, DID DAD EVER
SAY ANYTHING TO YOU

14:26.500 --> 14:28.650
THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN
WHY HE WOULD DO THIS ?

14:28.660 --> 14:31.356
LIKE, "BY THE WAY,
FEDERICO,

14:31.360 --> 14:33.248
I'VE LOST MY
FUCKING MIND" ?

14:33.260 --> 14:36.457
IT'S A GOOD
BUSINESS.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.859
STEADY.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.898
I GUESS HE WAS
STILL PISSED AT ME

14:41.900 --> 14:43.891
FOR NOT GOING INTO IT,
BUT, WHAT DOES HE THINK,

14:43.900 --> 14:45.697
HE CAN FORCE ME ?

14:45.700 --> 14:48.498
MAYBE HE WAS
PISSED AT DAVE.

15:13.730 --> 15:14.822
HEY...

15:19.230 --> 15:22.028
YOU WANNA GO
TO A THING TONIGHT ?

15:22.030 --> 15:25.488
I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR A THING TONIGHT, GABRIEL.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.525
COME ON, DON'T GO
THROUGH THIS ALONE.

15:27.530 --> 15:29.691
FAT CHANCE, IT'S LIKE I GOT
A BIG SIGN ON MY HEAD

15:29.700 --> 15:31.656
THAT SAYS, "FREAK
WITH THE DEAD DAD" !

15:31.660 --> 15:34.720
AND LIKE ALL THESE PEOPLE
WHO ARE SO TRAGIC
EVEN KNEW HIM.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.721
I MET YOUR
DAD ONCE.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.948
REMEMBER, HE BURIED
MY GRANDMOTHER ALICE.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.554
WHY ARE YOU
TALKING TO ME ?

15:41.560 --> 15:44.154
WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M A JERK ?

15:44.160 --> 15:45.855
YES.

15:45.860 --> 15:48.454
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE DIFFERENT NOW.

15:48.460 --> 15:51.156
I CAN SEE
THROUGH WALLS.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.354
UH-HUH.

15:56.260 --> 15:59.297
DON'T YOUR SCANKS
NEED TO BE WALKED ?

16:03.030 --> 16:04.622
I WANNA SEE YOU.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.121
MRS. FISHER ?

16:21.130 --> 16:23.428
I'M MATTHEW GILARDI.

16:23.430 --> 16:25.295
DO YOU HAVE
A MOMENT ?

16:27.900 --> 16:30.494
DID DAVID MENTION ME
BY ANY CHANCE ?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.456
I DON'T
THINK HE DID.

16:32.460 --> 16:34.826
WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D DROP OFF THE DETAILS

16:34.830 --> 16:37.458
OF OUR BUY-OUT OFFER
SO YOU COULD LOOK IT OVER.

16:37.460 --> 16:40.020

16:40.030 --> 16:42.498
ESPECIALLY
THE STOCK OPTIONS.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.190
WHO ARE YOU
TO BUY US OUT ?

16:47.200 --> 16:50.158
I NEVER SAW YOU

16:50.160 --> 16:53.049
I REPRESENT KRONER
SERVICE INTERNATIONAL.

16:53.060 --> 16:54.948

17:04.800 --> 17:07.519
YOU REALLY SHOULD
DISCUSS THIS WITH
YOUR SON, DAVID.

17:07.530 --> 17:09.327
I HAVE TWO SONS.

17:09.330 --> 17:10.649
REALLY ?

17:10.660 --> 17:12.821
I WAS ONLY
AWARE OF ONE.

17:12.830 --> 17:15.355
I KNOW HOW MANY SONS
I HAVE, MR. GILARDI.

17:17.860 --> 17:19.418
YES, MA'AM.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.854
JUST LOOK AT THE NUMBERS,
I'LL LET MYSELF OUT.

17:27.260 --> 17:28.921
( door closing )

17:28.930 --> 17:29.999
'MORNING.

17:33.530 --> 17:36.021
HOW ARE YOU
FOLKS TODAY ?

17:36.030 --> 17:38.021
DON'T EXPECT
TO BE POPULAR.

17:38.030 --> 17:40.055
HEY, BABY.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.994
NATE,
LOOK AT YOU.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.092
LOOK AT YOU.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.658
FOUR AND A
HALF MONTHS,

17:44.660 --> 17:46.252
THIS ONE WANTS
OUT ALREADY.

17:46.260 --> 17:48.490
BUT HONEY, WE GOT
A LITTLE PROBLEM.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.253
MY SISTER CAN'T PICK UP
JULIO FROM PRE-SCHOOL.

17:51.260 --> 17:53.751
SHE GOT ANOTHER CALL-BACK
FROM THAT CAT FOOD COMMERCIAL.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.751
YOUR SISTER, WHAT ABOUT
MY CAREER, HUH ?

17:55.760 --> 17:57.728
I CAN'T DO IT,
NOT TODAY,

17:57.730 --> 17:59.391
DAVID'S HEAD
WOULD EXPLODE.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.527
NATE, YOU OUGHTA
REMIND YOUR BROTHER

18:01.530 --> 18:02.952
HOW MANY CLIENTS
I HAVE REFERRED

18:02.960 --> 18:04.291
TO YOU GUYS
FROM HERE,

18:04.300 --> 18:06.222
AND TELL HIM TO
CUT RICO SOME SLACK.

18:06.230 --> 18:07.424
( Spanish )

18:07.430 --> 18:08.522
NO, NO, NO !

18:08.530 --> 18:10.293
( Spanish )

18:10.300 --> 18:12.427
AND YOU WON'T ?!

18:15.460 --> 18:17.655
RICO, GO.

18:17.660 --> 18:20.197
I'M THE NEW
BOSS, RIGHT ?

18:20.200 --> 18:21.849
OKAY.

18:21.860 --> 18:24.556
I'M TELLING DAVE
YOU SAID I COULD.

18:24.560 --> 18:25.549
YEAH.

18:25.560 --> 18:26.652
YEAH.

18:26.660 --> 18:28.218
I CAN DO THIS.

18:28.230 --> 18:30.494
I JUST NEED SOME HELP
GETTING HIM ONTO THE GURNEY.

18:40.660 --> 18:43.549
YOU CAN TOUCH HIM IF
YOU WEAR ONE OF THESE.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.448
BELIEVE ME,
HE WON'T MIND.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.890
YOU ALRIGHT ?

18:48.900 --> 18:51.653
PULL THE BED BACK,
LINE IT UP WITH THE GURNEY.

18:51.660 --> 18:52.752
ALRIGHT.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.722
OKAY.

18:56.730 --> 18:58.027
THAT GOOD ?

18:58.030 --> 18:59.952
YEAH, TAKE THIS
OFF FOR A SECOND.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.056
ALRIGHTY, GRAB
HIS SHOULDERS.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.288
ON THREE.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.597
READY ?

19:06.600 --> 19:07.919
ONE,

19:07.930 --> 19:09.329
TWO,

19:09.330 --> 19:10.456
THREE.

19:13.130 --> 19:13.755
WHOA !

19:16.460 --> 19:18.223
ANGEL LUST.

19:18.230 --> 19:20.255
DOES THAT
HAPPEN A LOT ?

19:20.260 --> 19:21.898
UH, A FAIR AMOUNT.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.858
YOU CAN BE DEAD, BUT
YOU'RE NEVER REALLY DEAD.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.154
( groaning noises )

19:33.500 --> 19:35.718
( phone ringing )

19:38.030 --> 19:38.951
HELLO.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.496
SO, I'VE BEEN
THINKING.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.024
WE'VE SKIPPED WAY
TOO MANY STEPS,

19:42.030 --> 19:43.622
WE NEED TO HAVE
A FIRST DATE.

19:43.630 --> 19:44.995
OKAY.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.150
I'M AT PINOT IN HOLLYWOOD,
KNOW WHERE THAT IS ?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.525
UH, YOU MEAN
RIGHT NOW ?

19:48.530 --> 19:49.895
YEAH.

19:49.900 --> 19:53.222
I'D LOVE TO, BUT,
I'VE GOT A DEAD BODY
IN THE CAR WITH ME.

19:53.230 --> 19:54.891
WELL, I CAN
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

19:54.900 --> 19:56.754
WHY YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO GET AWAY FROM THAT.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.923
C'MON, JUST
A GLASS OF WINE,
15 MINUTES,

19:59.930 --> 20:01.522
THE DEAD GUY
WON'T MIND.

20:04.060 --> 20:07.029
DO ME A FAVOR,
KEEP IT OUT
OF THE SUN.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.851
I HAD FORGOTTEN,
THEY MAKE NOISES.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.851
THE AIR COMES OUT,
IT'S LIKE...

20:12.860 --> 20:14.851
( groaning )

20:14.860 --> 20:15.997
NO!

20:16.000 --> 20:18.651
DAD KNEW I HATED THIS
WHOLE FUCKED UP BUSINESS.

20:18.660 --> 20:21.458
HE SHOULD
RESPECT THAT.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.928
WELL, POOR DAVE,
I'D BE PISSED TOO.

20:23.930 --> 20:25.352
ALTHOUGH, HE DOES
SEEM TO TAKE IT

20:25.360 --> 20:27.749
TO THIS EXTRA,
OLD TESTAMENT LEVEL.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.218
SO, DOES THIS MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GOING BACK
TO SEATTLE ON SUNDAY ?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.629
FUCK.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.928
OKAY, DON'T
THINK ABOUT IT.

20:34.930 --> 20:37.319
TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.

20:37.330 --> 20:39.355
LIKE THIS IS
OUR FIRST DATE,

20:39.360 --> 20:41.897
AND WE NEVER HAD SEX
BEFORE YOU KNEW MY NAME.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.653
YOU MEAN THE RECAP
OF MAJOR LIFE EVENTS

20:44.660 --> 20:46.696
TOLD IN A HUMOROUS AND
SELF DEPRECATING WAY,

20:46.700 --> 20:49.123
WHICH ALMOST ALWAYS
GETS ME LAID ?

20:49.130 --> 20:50.597
NO.

20:50.600 --> 20:51.953
WHY NOT ?

20:52.900 --> 20:55.118
I'M NOT THAT GUY
WITH YOU.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.529
WHO ARE YOU ?

20:57.500 --> 20:59.991
I DON'T KNOW,
SOMEBODY NEW.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.195
IT'S BECAUSE
OF YOUR FATHER.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.896
YOU WERE WITH ME
AT YOUR MOST VULNERABLE.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.255
YOU FELT COMFORTABLE,

21:10.260 --> 21:12.558
YOU FELT
REALLY ACCEPTED.

21:13.730 --> 21:17.052
DO YOU ALWAYS ANALYZE
GUYS ON THE FIRST DATE ?

21:17.060 --> 21:18.493
ONLY IF THEY'RE
INTERESTING.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.229
OH, SO YOU THINK
I'M INTERESTING.

21:20.230 --> 21:21.595
YEAH !

21:21.600 --> 21:23.795
I DON'T MEET THAT MANY
MEN WITH DEAD GUYS

21:23.800 --> 21:25.950
WITH HARD-ONS
IN THEIR CAR.

21:31.930 --> 21:33.921
( sniffing )

21:37.500 --> 21:40.458
SO, WHEN MRS. SWANSON'S
CREDIT CARD DIDN'T GO THROUGH,

21:40.460 --> 21:42.121
I RAN A CREDIT CHECK

21:42.130 --> 21:43.995
AND THEY WERE IN DEBT
UP TO THEIR EARS.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.322
WE HAVE A $3,200 TITAN CASKET
BEING DELIVERED TOMORROW.

21:47.330 --> 21:50.493
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THERE'S AN OFFER TO
BUY US OUT ?

21:50.500 --> 21:52.821
I'D KNOWN WHAT
YOU AND DAD THOUGHT

21:52.830 --> 21:54.422
OF KRONER SERVICE
INTERNATIONAL.

21:54.430 --> 21:56.591
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I THINK.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.125
NOT THAT IT
MATTERS TO YOU.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.060
AND NATE IS
NOT YOUR ENEMY.

22:02.060 --> 22:03.789
HE'LL DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.256
WHY DO YOU
SAY THAT ?

22:05.260 --> 22:07.728
HE SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE
DOING WHAT HE WANTS.

22:11.700 --> 22:13.725
DAD MUST'VE
REALLY HATED ME.

22:13.730 --> 22:14.856
HUSH.

22:16.500 --> 22:20.891
IT'S FISHER & SONS,
THAT'S GOTTA CONTINUE.

22:20.900 --> 22:23.323
AND YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA HAVE ANY KIDS.

22:28.660 --> 22:31.322
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME,
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG ?

22:31.330 --> 22:33.696
I STOPPED
TO EAT.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.258
I WISH
YOU'D CALLED.

22:35.260 --> 22:37.922
I THINK MR. SAUREZ
KINDA SHIT HIMSELF.

22:37.930 --> 22:39.488
IS THAT NORMAL ?

22:39.500 --> 22:40.797
YOU STOPPED
TO EAT ?

22:40.800 --> 22:42.756
DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPECT
FOR HUMAN LIFE AT ALL ?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.728
I HAVE A HUGE RESPECT
FOR HUMAN LIFE.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.391
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
THEY CAN TAKE A DUMP
WHEN THEY'RE DEAD !

22:46.400 --> 22:47.856
WELL, THEY CAN,
MAKE A NOTE !

22:47.860 --> 22:49.498
BOYS, I DON'T LIKE
THIS BICKERING.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.923
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T LIKE YOU
SLEEPING WITH HAIRDRESSERS.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.227
LOOK, DON'T TAKE
THIS OUT ON MOM.

23:07.230 --> 23:08.891
WHAT IS IT YOU
WANNA SAY TO ME ?

23:09.800 --> 23:12.724
WELL, THERE'S A BODY
THAT SPENT OVER TWO HOURS

23:12.730 --> 23:14.652
IN A VAN,
UNREFRIDGERATED,

23:14.660 --> 23:16.252
DECOMPOSING AT
A RATE MUCH FASTER

23:16.260 --> 23:17.818
THAN YOU COULD
EVER IMAGINE.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.855
THANKS FOR MAKING MY LIFE
JUST THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

23:19.860 --> 23:21.748
THANKS FOR UNDERMINING
MY AUTHORITY

23:21.760 --> 23:23.193
WITH OUR EMPLOYEES,

23:23.200 --> 23:25.054
AND THANKS FOR MAKING
IT SO CLEAR TO ME

23:25.060 --> 23:26.789
THAT MY CHOICE TO
DEDICATE MYSELF

23:26.800 --> 23:28.654
TO THIS BUSINESS
AND TO THIS FAMILY

23:28.660 --> 23:30.059
WAS REALLY STUPID.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.925
BECAUSE, APPARENTLY
I WOULD HAVE BEEN REWARDED

23:31.930 --> 23:33.921
JUST THE SAME FOR
WASTING MY LIFE.

23:33.930 --> 23:35.898
OH, MY LIFE IS
A WASTE, FUCK YOU !

23:35.900 --> 23:37.128
AT LEAST
I ENJOY IT.

23:37.130 --> 23:39.257
YEAH, WELL,
LUCKY YOU.

23:40.460 --> 23:42.997
DAVE, AT LEAST
LET ME HELP.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.627
YOU'VE HELPED ENOUGH !

23:57.930 --> 24:00.819
THIS IS NOT FAIR
THAT MY WHOLE LIFE

24:00.830 --> 24:02.718
IS BEING DECIDED
BY OTHER PEOPLE.

24:02.730 --> 24:04.891
HEY, COLLEGE
IS PAID FOR,

24:04.900 --> 24:07.221
THEY HAVE
GREAT PARTIES.

24:07.230 --> 24:08.891
NO STUDENT LOANS
TO PAY OFF.

24:08.900 --> 24:11.050
I'M NOT EXACTLY
A PARTY PERSON.

24:11.060 --> 24:12.925
BY THE WAY,
THAT SHIT YOU GAVE ME

24:12.930 --> 24:15.228
THE NIGHT MY DAD DIED,
IT REALLY FUCKED ME UP.

24:15.230 --> 24:17.619
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.452
YOU SHOULD BE.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.190
JUST, WHY IS COLLEGE
LIKE, THE ONLY OPTION ?

24:26.200 --> 24:28.395
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I WANNA DO.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.255
I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S
SOMETHING INSIDE ME.

24:31.260 --> 24:33.820
I'D JUST LIKE TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS

24:33.830 --> 24:36.253
BEFORE I GET COMPLETELY
REPROGRAMMED.

24:36.260 --> 24:38.694
NOBODY CAN
REPROGRAM YOU.

24:38.700 --> 24:41.328
YOU'RE THE MOST ORIGINAL
GIRL IN THE SCHOOL.

24:41.330 --> 24:44.299
LOOK AT THIS CAR
THAT YOU DRIVE.

24:45.530 --> 24:47.748
THIS FACE
THAT YOU DRIVE.

24:48.660 --> 24:50.548
THANKS A LOT.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.323
LIAR.

24:52.330 --> 24:53.695
I'M SERIOUS.

24:53.700 --> 24:56.419
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH GUTS IT TAKES
TO BE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU ?

25:09.960 --> 25:13.088
YOU CAN TOUCH 'EM
IF YOU WEAR ONE OF THESE.

25:13.100 --> 25:14.897
BELIEVE ME,
HE WON'T MIND.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.424
HE WON'T CARE.

25:21.630 --> 25:23.848
WHO DO YOU GOT
THERE, DAVID ?

25:23.860 --> 25:25.350
WHO IS THAT ?

25:25.360 --> 25:27.999
IT'S HIM ?
THAT'S MR. BLOOMBERG ?

25:28.900 --> 25:31.425
PUT HIM RIGHT DOWN
NEXT HIM THERE.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.921
OH, MY GOODNESS.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.122
YOU'RE OKAY, DAVID.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.392
( footsteps )

25:50.630 --> 25:52.848
MOM WANTS
TO SEE US.

26:04.500 --> 26:07.754
I'M GOING ON A HIKE
WITH SOMEONE.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.352
OKAY.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.248
OKAY ?

26:11.260 --> 26:13.490
I AM NOT ASKING
YOUR PERMISSION, DAVID.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.855
I AM YOUR MOTHER,
HOW DARE YOU !

26:17.000 --> 26:20.151
YOU BOTH HAVE
PRIVATE LIVES.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.957
AND I KNOW IT.

26:24.660 --> 26:26.753
WHY SHOULDN'T I ?

26:26.760 --> 26:27.556
YOU SHOULD.

26:29.330 --> 26:31.150
GO.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.424
EXCUSE ME, I NEED
HER TO MEET WITH
MRS. SWANSON.

26:33.430 --> 26:36.194
IT'S FISHER & SONS.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.627
WELL, THIS SUCKS.

26:40.630 --> 26:42.791
I HAVE TO GO FIGHT FOR
A HOLE IN THE GROUND

26:42.800 --> 26:44.324
AT ROSEMONT CEMETERY

26:44.330 --> 26:46.423
OR MR. AND MRS. SAUREZ
WON'T BE BURIED TOGETHER.

26:46.430 --> 26:49.752
THEY'LL BE ON OPPOSITE SIDES
OF THE GODDAMN FREEWAY.

26:53.830 --> 26:55.229
DAVE,

26:55.230 --> 26:57.027
LISTEN...

27:00.730 --> 27:02.891
CAN I DO ANYTHING
TO HELP ?

27:04.130 --> 27:07.122
CAN YOU TELL ADELE SWANSON
WE KNOW SHE'S BROKE

27:07.130 --> 27:09.121
AND CAN'T AFFORD
THE FUNERAL SHE ORDERED ?

27:09.130 --> 27:11.496
CAN YOU DO THAT ?

27:11.500 --> 27:12.956
I GUESS.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.449
YES.

27:15.460 --> 27:17.792
THE SWANSONS
ARE CON ARTISTS.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.018
THEY RAN A FRANCHISE
PYRAMID SCHEME,

27:20.030 --> 27:22.851
THEY HAVE NO MONEY,
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA
CON US TOO.

27:22.860 --> 27:24.157
I MADE SOME NOTES,

27:26.100 --> 27:28.796
YOU KNOW,
I WORK WITH VENDORS.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.859
BIG ONES,
NATIONAL ONES.

27:30.860 --> 27:33.499
I'M NOT A IDIOT,
I CAN DO THIS.

27:37.330 --> 27:38.729
THANK YOU.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.591
SHIT.

27:59.300 --> 28:00.494
WHAT ?

28:00.500 --> 28:04.288
DO YOU HAVE TO BE
ANYWHERE TONIGHT ?

28:05.430 --> 28:07.295
NOT REALLY.

28:15.800 --> 28:19.520
THE OTHER MR. FISHER
RECOMMENDED THE $9,000 COFFIN,

28:19.530 --> 28:21.327
I DIDN'T ASK FOR IT.

28:21.330 --> 28:23.855
I THINK CREMATION IS
MUCH MORE DIGNIFIED.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.999
AND, IT'S WITHIN RANGE,

28:26.000 --> 28:27.922
GIVEN THE FINANCIAL
SITUATION.

28:27.930 --> 28:29.557
CHANDLER CREATED
BEAUTY VISION,

28:29.560 --> 28:32.256
WE HAVE FRANCHISES
IN 13 STATES,

28:32.260 --> 28:33.989
AND THE NATION
OF URUGUAY.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.423
HOW MUCH DID YOU KNOW ABOUT
YOUR HUSBAND'S BUSINESS ?

28:36.430 --> 28:39.228
'CAUSE HE'S BEEN RUNNING UP
BAD DEBTS FOR SOME TIME.

28:39.230 --> 28:41.653
WE WERE ALWAYS MOVING,
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS

28:41.660 --> 28:43.753
BECAUSE HE WAS MAKING
SO MUCH MONEY.

28:43.760 --> 28:46.888
EACH PLACE WAS NICER
THAN THE LAST.

28:48.930 --> 28:51.023
FORMER PARTNERS
ARE SUING HIM,

28:51.030 --> 28:53.692
YOU HAVE SEVERAL
CREDIT CARDS MAXED OUT,

28:53.700 --> 28:57.522
RUN-INS WITH THE IRS
DATING TO 1996,

28:57.530 --> 28:59.725
AND YALE UNIVERSITY
WOULD LIKE HIM

28:59.730 --> 29:02.051
TO QUIT TELLING PEOPLE
HE WENT THERE.

29:02.060 --> 29:04.449
THIS CAN'T
BE HAPPENING.

29:04.460 --> 29:07.293
I HAVE A BABY !

29:07.300 --> 29:09.518
I CAN'T GO BACK
TO WAITRESSING.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.157
AND NOW YOU'RE
TELLING ME

29:11.160 --> 29:13.219
THAT WE CAN'T EVEN
AFFORD A COFFIN ?

29:13.230 --> 29:15.448
WHAT WILL
PEOPLE THINK ?

29:16.930 --> 29:19.023
MRS. SWANSON, I'M
SITTING HERE THINKING,

29:19.030 --> 29:20.793
WHY DON'T
YOU RENT IT ?

29:20.800 --> 29:23.155
HOW MUCH WOULD
THAT BE ?

29:23.160 --> 29:24.923
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE ?

29:24.930 --> 29:28.229
I DON'T KNOW,
MY ATM CARD'S
NOT WORKING.

29:28.230 --> 29:30.448
WE'LL WORK
SOMETHING OUT.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.951
AND Al-TERWARDS

29:32.960 --> 29:35.599
WE'LL GIVE YOU
HIS ASHES IN AN URN.

29:50.900 --> 29:52.197
OH!

29:52.200 --> 29:54.589
YOU REALLY LOVED HIM,
DIDN'T YOU ?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.820
OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.058
IT'S ALRIGHT,
LET IT OUT.

30:11.800 --> 30:15.099
I THINK IT'S GOOD YOU
TOLD YOUR BOYS ABOUT ME.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.853
ARE YOU KIDDING ?
IT WAS INSANE.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.295
I CERTAINLY DIDN'T
CHOOSE TO DO IT,

30:21.300 --> 30:23.325
IT JUST HAPPENED.

30:23.330 --> 30:24.456
IT WAS BRAVE.

30:24.460 --> 30:25.996
IT WAS GUILT.

30:28.830 --> 30:30.991
I LOVE
MY HUSBAND.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.099
I KNOW YOU DO.

30:38.630 --> 30:41.952
HIRAM, WHEN
I THINK OF US NOW...

30:42.900 --> 30:45.095
I FEEL LIKE I'M WATCHING
THE WHOLE THING

30:45.100 --> 30:47.955
ON SOME SEX CHANNEL
ON CABLE TV.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.897
IS THAT RIGHT ?

30:51.660 --> 30:52.695
YES.

30:53.860 --> 30:57.023
AND THAT MY HUSBAND
MIGHT BE WATCHING IT, TOO.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.022
I WANT SOME CHANGES MADE,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

31:02.030 --> 31:05.295
I'M NOT ANSWERING DEAD CALLS
ALL NIGHT LONG ANYMORE.

31:05.300 --> 31:07.689
LET THEM HIRE
SOMEBODY, OR,

31:07.700 --> 31:10.351
SELL THE BUSINESS,
OR WHATEVER.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.821
I WANNA TAKE
YOU SOMEWHERE,

31:14.830 --> 31:16.092
AWAY FROM ALL THIS.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.021
NO.

31:17.030 --> 31:18.327
THEY'RE ADULTS.

31:18.330 --> 31:21.299
THEY CAN TAKE CARE
OF THEMSELVES.

31:21.300 --> 31:24.554
I HAVE TWO PLANE TICKETS
TO COSTA RICA,

31:24.560 --> 31:26.050
A WEEK FROM MONDAY.

31:26.060 --> 31:27.527
SEPARATE ROOMS.

31:30.330 --> 31:32.855
I WAS 19 WHEN
I GOT MARRIED.

31:32.860 --> 31:35.397
I'VE NEVER BEEN
ON MY OWN.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.153
I WOULDN'T
EVEN KNOW HOW.

31:42.160 --> 31:43.855
I'M SORRY.

31:46.300 --> 31:49.019
YOU'RE A VERY
KIND PERSON, AND,

31:49.030 --> 31:50.918
YOU'VE BEEN GOOD TO ME.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.495
I'M SORRY.

31:59.700 --> 32:00.758
GOODBYE.

32:11.560 --> 32:21.151
( country rock playing )

32:21.160 --> 32:24.095
GOOD CHOICE
OF MUSIC.

32:24.100 --> 32:26.728
IT'S FROM HIS CAR.

32:26.730 --> 32:29.790
IT'S THE LAST CD
HE EVER HEARD.

32:33.130 --> 32:35.348
( male )
ADELE SWANSON !

32:35.360 --> 32:37.828
YOUR HUSBAND
OWES ME $45,000.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.855
LISTEN, HE KEPT IT
ALL FROM HER.

32:39.860 --> 32:41.498
NOW SHE'S BROKE
WITH A BABY,

32:41.500 --> 32:42.797
AND YOU'RE GONNA
LEAVE HER ALONE.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.358
WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU ?!

32:44.360 --> 32:46.419
I OWN THIS PLACE,
GET THE HELL OUT
BEFORE I CALL THE COPS.

32:46.430 --> 32:47.795
YOU PEOPLE SUCK.

32:48.700 --> 32:49.997
( door slamming )

32:50.000 --> 32:52.059
WHAT WAS THAT ?

32:52.060 --> 32:54.620
SOME FREAK SWANSON
OWED MONEY TO.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.552
NATE, I NOTICE
MR. SWANSON IS IN
THE TITAN CASKET.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.755
YEAH, YEAH, BUT
SHE'S GIVING IT BACK.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.523
I MADE THE DEAL
FOR CREMATION.

33:06.530 --> 33:09.499
THEY CAN'T GIVE IT BACK,
BY LAW, IT HAS TO BE
BURNED WITH HIM.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.695
YOU JUST COST US $9,000,
YOU FUCKING MORON.

33:11.700 --> 33:12.826
WHAT ?

33:12.830 --> 33:14.252
( doorbell )

33:14.260 --> 33:16.649
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW THAT ?

33:21.060 --> 33:23.620
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

33:23.630 --> 33:25.188
JENNIFER.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.650
I WAS IN BOCA RATON.

33:31.660 --> 33:33.719
MY MOM HAD TO HAVE
HER HIP REPLACED.

33:33.730 --> 33:35.049
OH, DEAR,
HOW IS SHE ?

33:35.060 --> 33:36.618
SHE'S BETTER,
THAN KS.

33:36.630 --> 33:38.825
SO, I DIDN'T FIND OUT
ABOUT MR. FISHER

33:38.830 --> 33:40.354
'TIL YESTERDAY.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.954
I'M JUST
HEARTBROKEN
ABOUT IT.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.655
I'LL MISS HIM.

33:44.660 --> 33:46.218
WELL,
HE ADORED YOU.

33:49.730 --> 33:51.789
OH, DAVID,

33:51.800 --> 33:54.997
I WON'T BE ANSWERING
THE PHONES ANYMORE.

33:57.430 --> 33:59.227
UH, OKAY.

34:09.960 --> 34:12.190
NOW EVERY PART
OF YOUR BODY

34:12.200 --> 34:13.849
HAS A NEW
MEANING TO ME.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.396
WE SHOULD GO.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.994
LIKE YOUR NOSE.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.228
C'MON.

34:21.230 --> 34:23.551
AND YOUR
LITTLE HANDS.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.323
HANDS I GET.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.822
AND YOUR TOES.

34:28.830 --> 34:30.991
IT'S TICKLISH.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.456
HERE, TRY THESE.

34:32.460 --> 34:34.291
YOU CAN
PLAY WITH MINE.

34:34.300 --> 34:37.394
YOU'RE RIGHT, NOW
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.197
SEE, IT'S PERFECT.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.954
WOULD YOU, UM...

34:47.100 --> 34:49.489
NAH, I'M EMBARRASSED.

34:49.500 --> 34:50.421
WHAT ?

34:53.460 --> 34:56.327
WOULD YOU RUB IT ?

34:59.600 --> 35:00.749
OKAY.

35:02.760 --> 35:05.228
YOU'RE MAKING
MY TOE HARD.

35:08.630 --> 35:11.349
DO YOU WANT
TO KISS IT ?

35:11.360 --> 35:12.759
YOUR TOE ?

35:12.760 --> 35:13.988
NO.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.093
C'MON, I'LL DO
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.021
ANYTHING.

35:20.430 --> 35:23.399
AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING ?

35:24.530 --> 35:25.952
OH.

35:27.330 --> 35:28.558
PLEASE.

35:40.330 --> 35:43.857
UGH, YOU FILTHY,
DEAD FUCK.

35:49.300 --> 35:51.552
HEY, NATE.

35:51.560 --> 35:52.891
KEITH.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.891
I MET YOU AT
YOUR DAD'S VIEWING.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.925
OH, YEAH, DAVID'S
RACQUETBALL PARTNER.

35:56.930 --> 35:59.922
YEAH, IS, UH,
DAVID INSIDE ?

35:59.930 --> 36:03.559
NO, HE WENT OUT FOR DINNER
WITH HIS EX FIANCE.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.723
SHE MISSED DAD'S FUNERAL,
AND THEY WERE PRETTY CLOSE.

36:06.730 --> 36:09.528
HEY, THAT'S COOL,
I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.

36:09.530 --> 36:11.418
I HAVE HIS CELL PHONE NUMBER
IF YOU WANNA GIVE HIM A CALL.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.557
I ALREADY GAVE IT A SHOT,
HE DIDN'T ANSWER.

36:13.560 --> 36:16.028
HEY, IS DAVID
ANY GOOD,

36:16.030 --> 36:18.521
AT RACQUETBALL,
'CAUSE,

36:18.530 --> 36:20.327
WE USED TO PLAY WHEN
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL

36:20.330 --> 36:22.321
AND HE WAS PATHETIC,
RUNNIN' INTO WALLS.

36:22.330 --> 36:24.389
YEAH, I THINK YOU'D
BE PRETTY SURPRISED

36:24.400 --> 36:26.356
JUST HOW GOOD
HE'S GOTTEN.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.658
WELL, I'LL TELL HIM
YOU CAME BY.

36:28.660 --> 36:30.093
THAN KS.

36:40.530 --> 36:42.521
DEAR GOD.

36:50.030 --> 36:52.453
I NEED TO
GET HIS WATCH.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.099
I NEED TO SELL IT
FOR THE MONEY.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.723
MY LIFE IS OVER.

36:59.730 --> 37:01.789
THIS IS A HARD TIME,
THE HARDEST.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.018
IT WAS ALL A LIE.

37:04.030 --> 37:05.554
HE LEI-T US
WITH NOTHING

37:05.560 --> 37:07.528
BECAUSE THERE
NEVER WAS ANYTHING.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.093
BASTARD !

37:20.600 --> 37:22.795
( door closing )

37:32.660 --> 37:35.652
I ALMOST DIED WHEN I SAW
OUR ENGAGEMENT PICTURES

37:35.660 --> 37:37.457
STILL ON
YOUR MANTLE.

37:37.460 --> 37:38.893
WHY ?

37:38.900 --> 37:41.858
MY FAMILY LOVED YOU,
MY FATHER ESPECIALLY.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.294
HE LOVED YOU.

37:44.300 --> 37:47.224
HE HAD A FUNNY
WAY OF SHOWING IT.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.693
I'M DRUNK.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.622
THEN I CAN ASK.

37:57.560 --> 37:59.755
ARE YOU HAPPY ?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.025
I'M STILL ME.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.957
YOUR FATHER KNEW.

38:09.860 --> 38:12.055
WE HAD COFFEE ONCE
AND HE TOLD ME

38:12.060 --> 38:14.699
HE UNDERSTOOD WHY
WE COULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

38:14.700 --> 38:16.520
HE SAID YOU SPENT
SO MUCH TIME

38:16.530 --> 38:18.498
TRYING TO MAKE
OTHER PEOPLE HAPPY,

38:18.500 --> 38:21.219
YOU NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT YOURSELF.

38:21.230 --> 38:23.926
HE WORRIED
ABOUT THAT.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.058
SO, DO YOU HAVE
ANYONE NOW ?

38:34.060 --> 38:36.449
CAN YOU TELL
ME ABOUT HIM ?

38:36.460 --> 38:38.894
YOU'RE COMPLETELY WRONG
ABOUT MY FATHER.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.357
YOU DIDN'T
KNOW HIM AT ALL,
NOBODY DID.

38:46.630 --> 38:49.622
LET'S GET A ROOM
AND FUCK OUR BRAINS OUT,

38:49.630 --> 38:51.120
HOW ABOUT IT ?

38:51.130 --> 38:53.348
JESUS, DAVID.

39:03.730 --> 39:05.095
HI.

39:05.100 --> 39:07.751
I GOT YOUR MESSAGE,
SORRY I DIDN'T CALL YOU BACK.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.728
I HAD TO GO OUT
TO COUNTY HOSPITAL.

39:09.730 --> 39:12.096
THE BODY'S STILL
IN LONG BEACH.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.125
THE AUTOPSY'S
NOT EVEN FINISHED YET.

39:14.130 --> 39:15.893
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

39:15.900 --> 39:17.959
HOW WAS
THE MEETING ?

39:19.030 --> 39:20.691
EVERYONE ASKED
ABOUT YOU.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.588
THEY WANNA MEET YOU.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.750
I WANNA MEET THEM.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.827
I'M A LITTLE DRUNK,

39:28.830 --> 39:31.094
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO
UNDRESS ME.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.590
OKAY.

39:33.830 --> 39:36.128
RIGHT AFTER YOU
STOP LYING TO ME.

40:40.330 --> 40:42.127
UHH, BRENDA ?

40:42.130 --> 40:43.893
YES, NATE.

40:43.900 --> 40:46.949
WHY IS MY NAME
TATTOOED ON
YOUR ASS ?

40:46.960 --> 40:49.258
IT'S NOT YOUR NAME.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.521
YES, IT IS.

40:53.730 --> 40:56.449
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY
PERSON NAMED THAT.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.955
NATE, IT'S
A COINCIDENCE.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.723
IT'S NOT YOU
OR ANYONE YOU KNOW.

41:12.230 --> 41:14.949
C'MON, WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M SO ENAMORED WITH YOU

41:14.960 --> 41:17.690
I HAD YOUR NAME
BURNED INTO MY FLESH ?

41:17.700 --> 41:19.588
HOW COME I NEVER
SAW IT BEFORE ?

41:19.600 --> 41:22.091
WE'VE HAD SEX TWICE.

41:22.100 --> 41:25.228
ONCE WITH
OUR CLOTHES ON,

41:25.230 --> 41:28.449
AND ONCE IN THE DARK AFTER
THREE MARTINIS A PIECE.

41:28.460 --> 41:30.155
YOU OBVIOUSLY LIKED
SOME GUY ENOUGH

41:30.160 --> 41:31.718
TO HAVE HIS NAME
BURNED INTO YOUR FLESH.

41:35.160 --> 41:38.357
I WOULD HAVE DONE A LOT
MORE THAN THAT FOR HIM.

41:59.330 --> 42:03.619
( snoring )

42:21.400 --> 42:24.426
IT'S ABOUT TIME,
YOU FUCKING MORON.

42:24.430 --> 42:26.694
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN THERE ?

42:26.700 --> 42:29.021
COULD YOU HELP ME OUT,
YOU FUCKING MORON ?

42:29.030 --> 42:30.827
WHY CAN'T YOU
JUST CLIMB OUT ?

42:30.830 --> 42:34.095
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT,
YOU FUCKING MORON.

42:45.300 --> 42:48.497
YOU REALLY SHOULD DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.219
IT'S REALLY DEEP.

42:51.230 --> 42:54.154
MIGHT AS WELL
BE BLEEDING.

42:56.100 --> 42:58.751
COULD YOU BE A LITTLE
MORE DRAMATIC ?

42:58.760 --> 43:01.422
OH, I COULD BE
A LOT MORE DRAMATIC.

43:01.660 --> 43:04.549
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TODAY ?

43:04.560 --> 43:08.496
DAVE AND I HAVE TO GO
GET THE REGISTRATION

43:08.500 --> 43:10.627
OUT OF THE WRECKED HEARSE.

43:10.630 --> 43:14.054
INSURANCE WON'T
REPLACE WITHOUT IT.

43:15.130 --> 43:16.495
WHAT TIME ?

43:16.500 --> 43:18.889
2:30, I THINK.

43:18.900 --> 43:21.095
TAKE YOUR
CELL PHONE.

43:21.100 --> 43:23.022
OKAY.

43:23.030 --> 43:25.225
PROMISE ME
YOU WILL.

43:26.030 --> 43:27.588
ALRIGHT.

43:37.030 --> 43:39.999
OH, I DON'T FEEL LIKE
CARBS THIS MORNING.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.254
DO WE HAVE ANYMORE OF THOSE
STEVIE NICKS RASPBERRIES ?

43:43.260 --> 43:44.989
CLAIRE.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.628
DO YOU HAVE AN
EATING DISORDER ?

43:47.630 --> 43:51.396
WHAT ? NO, MOM,
I WISH, BUT...

44:03.300 --> 44:05.450
ARE YOU
BEING HELPED ?

44:05.460 --> 44:07.451
YEAH...
MY POP'S HERE.

44:07.460 --> 44:08.597
SAU REZ.

44:08.600 --> 44:09.794

44:09.800 --> 44:12.223
THAT'S THE
TITAN SERIES.

44:12.230 --> 44:13.754
IT'S QUITE
BEAUTIFUL.

44:13.760 --> 44:14.988
GIVE ME A NUMBER.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.592
$9,000.

44:16.600 --> 44:19.455
YOU GUYS OUGHTA
GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.

44:19.460 --> 44:21.599
YOUR BROTHER SAID
THAT THIS WAS ON SPECIAL,

44:21.600 --> 44:23.989
$4,500, AND THEN HE
CAME DOWN TO $4,000.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.854
SO, WHY DON'T
WE START THERE ?

44:29.200 --> 44:31.452
( Rico )
THAT'S NOT LEGAL,
RESELLING A COFFIN.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.325
THERE ARE FLUIDS
THAT SEEP.

44:33.330 --> 44:35.389
OKAY, AND
MR. SWANSON,
HE SEEPED.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.391
WHAT DID YOU
TELL MR. SAUREZ ?

44:37.400 --> 44:38.753
HEY, HE WANTS
A QUALITY COFFIN,

44:38.760 --> 44:40.227
WE HAPPEN TO HAVE
ONE AVAILABLE.

44:40.230 --> 44:41.595
I DON'T AGREE
WITH THIS AT ALL.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.454
IT'S AGAINST
MY BELIEFS.

44:43.460 --> 44:44.552
THANK YOU,
FEDERICO.

44:44.560 --> 44:45.629
AND IT'S
UNSANITARY.

44:45.630 --> 44:46.858
THEY'RE DEAD !

44:46.860 --> 44:48.396
WHAT DISEASE CAN
THEY POSSIBLY CATCH ?!

44:48.400 --> 44:50.891
IT'S TOO LATE, NATE,
IT'S A $9,000 RETAIL ITEM,

44:50.900 --> 44:52.856
OUR COST IS $3,200,
WE EAT THAT,

44:52.860 --> 44:54.498
PLUS WE LOSE
THE PROFIT.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.923
THERE'S A
$6,000 MARK UP ?!

45:02.930 --> 45:05.455
MR. SAUREZ, WE CANNOT
LET YOU HAVE THAT CASKET.

45:05.460 --> 45:07.257
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

45:07.260 --> 45:09.296
WE CAN'T
LEGALLY SELL IT
TO YOU BECAUSE,

45:09.300 --> 45:11.894
VERY BRIEFLY, IT WAS
OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER PERSON.

45:11.900 --> 45:12.992
$3,500.

45:13.000 --> 45:13.898
SOLD !

45:13.900 --> 45:15.026
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

45:15.030 --> 45:16.452
DAVID, DON'T BE
A FUCKIN' MORON.

45:16.460 --> 45:18.519
LOOK, FELLAS, LET'S
SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.

45:18.530 --> 45:21.021
BECAUSE I GOTTA GET
A HAIRCUT BEFORE THE SERVICE.

45:21.030 --> 45:22.622
MY BROTHER HAS
NO AUTHORIZATION--

45:22.630 --> 45:24.928
MR. SAUREZ,
IT'S A $9,000 PRODUCT,

45:24.930 --> 45:26.249
IT'S USED ONE NIGHT,

45:26.260 --> 45:27.818
YOU'RE GETTING IT
AT COST TO US.

45:27.830 --> 45:29.718
WOULD YOU BE
WILLING TO STIPULATE

45:29.730 --> 45:31.618
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
THE CONDITION OF THE COFFIN ?

45:31.630 --> 45:32.927
SURE, WHATEVER.

45:32.930 --> 45:34.727
MAY I MAKE
A SUGGESTION ?

45:34.730 --> 45:36.652
YOU'VE CLOSED, OKAY ?

45:36.660 --> 45:39.595
DON'T OVER-CLOSE,
IT KILLS THE WORD OF MOUTH.

45:45.430 --> 45:55.192
( rock music playing )

46:06.160 --> 46:08.321
IS THAT THE BEST ANYBODY
COULD COME UP WITH ?

46:08.330 --> 46:10.252
"FATHER, HUSBAND,
CAREGIVER" ?

46:10.260 --> 46:12.148
HOW WOULD YOU PREFER ?

46:12.160 --> 46:14.355

MIND-FUCKER ?

46:14.360 --> 46:16.453

46:32.830 --> 46:34.650

46:34.660 --> 46:36.127
YOU THINK YOU
CAN HOLD OUT ?

46:36.130 --> 46:38.428
WE CONTROL
SUPPLIERS NOW.

46:38.430 --> 46:40.193
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
GET YOUR CHEMICALS ?

46:40.200 --> 46:42.156

CASKETS AND LINERS ?

46:42.160 --> 46:43.696

46:43.700 --> 46:46.021
I MEAN, THIS GUY
IS A TOP NOTCH
RESTORATIVE ARTIST.

46:46.030 --> 46:49.124
ARE YOU THREATENING TO
PUT US OUT OF BUSINESS ?

46:49.130 --> 46:51.052
WE LOOK AT IT
AS A PARTNERSHIP.

46:51.060 --> 46:52.652
IN THE DEATH CARE
INDUSTRY NOW,

46:52.660 --> 46:54.890
IT'S CONSOLIDATE OR DIE.

46:54.900 --> 46:57.926
DECIDE WHICH, NATE,

46:57.930 --> 47:00.148
'CAUSE WE WILL PUT

47:08.800 --> 47:10.199
WHOO-HOO

47:15.760 --> 47:17.751
SIGN THIS
RIGHT HERE.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.649
WELL, IT'S TOTALED.

47:33.660 --> 47:36.254
THE INSURANCE COMPANY
WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

47:45.400 --> 47:47.288
WHOA, FUCK !

47:51.030 --> 47:52.918
THERE'S STILL
BLOOD ON THE WHEEL.

48:18.660 --> 48:20.321
HELLO.

48:20.330 --> 48:23.219
( Brenda )
Meet me at the corner
of Sunset and Gordon.

48:23.230 --> 48:25.425
Now, it's
important.

48:25.430 --> 48:27.853
WHAT ?

48:27.860 --> 48:29.191
Bring your brother.

48:29.200 --> 48:31.156

48:41.900 --> 48:44.755

48:45.960 --> 48:47.120
FUCK.

48:49.900 --> 48:52.255
I THINK
WE SHOULD SELL.

48:52.260 --> 48:55.889
AND ERASE EVERYTHING THIS FAMILY
HAS MEANT FOR 50 YEARS ?

48:55.900 --> 48:58.619
THAT MIGHT NOT
BE A BAD THING.

49:08.730 --> 49:10.152
HEY.

BRENDA.
