00:06.874 --> 00:08.907
<i> [jeremy] this time</i>
<i>  on moonshiners...</i>

00:08.909 --> 00:10.142
-Dang.
-Yellowjackets' nest.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.311
-No [bleep]
-[digger laughs]

00:12.313 --> 00:14.079
<i> [digger] you know,</i>
<i>  it's gonna be</i>
<i>  a little bit of a chore</i>

00:14.081 --> 00:16.181
<i>  getting this mash prepared.</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:19.318
Our job here
is just to make sure this
isn't a total failure.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.387
-[beaz] damn.
-Poor son of a bitch.

00:21.389 --> 00:23.722
[huck] you think
this'll fix that liquor up,
amanda?

00:23.724 --> 00:25.224
[amanda] I think it'll give it
a real good taste.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.092
Amanda,
she impressed me pretty good

00:27.094 --> 00:29.695
on the way she's infusing the
liquors and stuff,

00:29.697 --> 00:33.132
and got me to thinking,
she can help me to move
this stuff down.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.700
-[amanda] oh.
-Worked for a minute.

00:35.970 --> 00:36.869
<i> [tim] sweet tea and moonshine.</i>

00:36.871 --> 00:38.203
If I could bottle it,

00:38.205 --> 00:40.939
can it,
I think I got something
to bring to market.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.875
These are those
200 milliliter cans.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.676
<i> -[tim] technology, man.</i>
<i> -[chad] I know.</i>

00:44.678 --> 00:46.712
Ahh! Woah, woah.

00:46.714 --> 00:50.182
[chad] oh! There you go.
The handle's off.

00:50.184 --> 00:53.385
<i> [man 1] this is how</i>
<i>  we make the moonshine.</i>

00:57.224 --> 00:59.291
<i> [mark 1] I ate enough slop for</i>
<i>  her to haul.</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:03.128
-Beaz.
-That's fourth time.

01:03.130 --> 01:06.065
-What's he want?
-I don't know.
He ain't leaving no message.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.200
-Oh, hell.
-Oh, hell.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.102
Maybe we don't
have to call him.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.304
<i> [mark 1] you know, I don't</i>
<i>  really know why beaz is here,</i>

01:12.306 --> 01:14.540
but you can
bet your ass that, uh,

01:14.542 --> 01:18.077
it'll be something
that will cause us
a little bit of misery.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.378
Beasley.

01:20.481 --> 01:23.182
Oh, man. Hey,
I've been trying to call
y'all.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.416
-We know.
-No [bleep]

01:24.418 --> 01:25.984
we've been trying to
ignore you.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.854
W... Well,
good to see you too.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.689
I need y'alls help. Come here,
I gotta show you something.

01:30.691 --> 01:31.890
I gotta show you this.

01:31.892 --> 01:35.928
Our old stand-up comic buddy
killer beaz, he's back again.

01:35.930 --> 01:39.064
-[digger] stand back.
Soccer balls go everywhere.
-[beaz laughs]

01:39.066 --> 01:40.299
<i> [digger] he's</i>
<i>  a little excited.</i>

01:40.301 --> 01:42.468
Beaz is like a little dog
with a full bladder.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.870
He's just bouncing
all over the place.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.506
[beaz] I have been
foraging around

01:47.508 --> 01:48.507
the southeast.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.310
I've got huge figs.

01:51.312 --> 01:55.314
This is peaches
and kiwifruit.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.915
-[mark 1] yes.
-[digger] looks like throw up.

01:56.917 --> 01:59.084
In here, it does for now.

01:59.086 --> 01:59.885
-Uh--
-[mark 1] shrimps?

01:59.887 --> 02:01.220
That was bananas.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.856
-[mark 1] uh.
-[digger] beaz, boy,
they're not attractive now.

02:03.858 --> 02:07.259
[beaz] the reason I'm showing
y'all all this, my wife's
birthday is coming up.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.862
She loves fruit salad
and stuff like that.

02:09.864 --> 02:13.398
And I wanna make
a batch of fruit brandy

02:13.400 --> 02:16.902
-called ambrosia shine.
-Oh, that's what
you're gonna call it.

02:16.904 --> 02:20.772
What I'm here for is
to ask you guys
if you'll help me do it.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.075
I've never mixed
a bunch of fruits together,

02:23.077 --> 02:25.777
so there's some
uncharted territory for me.

02:25.779 --> 02:26.945
Ambrosia, to me,

02:26.947 --> 02:28.847
is to be the stuff
that you got on the salad bar

02:28.849 --> 02:31.550
that had different color,
uh, fruit in it

02:31.552 --> 02:34.319
and different
little bitty baby marshmallows
and stuff.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.522
We always called it
heavenly hash.

02:36.524 --> 02:41.226
This is scuppnines like
a really tough skinned grape.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.461
Well, it's a muscadine.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.397
[beaz] kinda like a muscadine
they're in the same family.

02:45.399 --> 02:48.066
They grow crazy-wild
all over the southeast.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.035
-So--
-well,
I've heard of scuppernongs.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.270
-[digger] yeah.
-It's the same thing,

02:51.272 --> 02:53.472
but the people home
call it scuppernine.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.474
-Scuppnines.
-They won't say nog,

02:55.476 --> 02:57.976
they go, "man, I'm full
up of scuppnines."

02:57.978 --> 03:00.212
scuppnines.
You be at the walmart,

03:00.214 --> 03:03.916
you're in the pajama bottoms
going,
"man I'm full of scuppnines."

03:03.918 --> 03:06.952
well, around here,
what beaz is calling
a scuppernine

03:06.954 --> 03:10.923
is actually a scupperdine,
which is
in the muscadine family,

03:10.925 --> 03:13.091
and they come scuppernogs
around here.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.160
You know, that's more
in the wine category.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.996
But you know,
if you make wine,
you can make liquor out of it.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.299
So maybe a little flavor
will carry through with it.

03:20.301 --> 03:25.137
Normally, we wouldn't
take all this time
to do this for you

03:25.139 --> 03:27.339
because it's a gallon or so.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.942
-Right.
-And you're very capable
of doing it.

03:29.944 --> 03:31.677
But

03:31.679 --> 03:35.948
-since it is terry's birthday,
I think we can make it work.
-[beaz] cool.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.951
And, and I'll say this,
it would mean even more to her

03:38.953 --> 03:41.153
to know that you
guys helped to do it.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.722
We've got some things
we've got to get squared away

03:43.724 --> 03:47.326
before we obligate to this.
Let's meet back down here
in the morning.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.061
-Okay.
-And then we'll get
busy with it.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.530
I wish that I could say
it's good to see you.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.234
-Well, I will say
it's good to see, y'all then.
-[mark 1] no.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.002
-Thank you.
-[mark 1] it's good
to see you, too.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.204
We're planning
on going back to
our old steel site.

03:59.206 --> 04:01.473
We haven't been back
to it yet this year,

04:01.475 --> 04:04.376
and I think it's high time
we get back
to production there.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.845
-See you beaz.
-All right.
I'll see you later, guys.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.013
See you in the morning.

04:17.324 --> 04:18.490
[howard] all right.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.259
Well, the water looks good,

04:20.261 --> 04:22.127
the sun getting ready to drop,

04:22.129 --> 04:23.729
and the fish
getting ready to bite.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.031
Tim I got something
for you to try.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.866
[tim] man,
I hooked something
over there a while go.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.302
-[howard] I got something
special for you, tim.
-[tim] yeah, what you got.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.870
I got some of the best
moonshine...

04:31.872 --> 04:33.071
-Yeah?
-You want to
drink in your life.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.239
[tim] yeah? Okay.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.079
-Pretty good.
-Yes!

04:41.081 --> 04:42.514
-[tim] uh-huh.
-I have got it.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.016
But, you know what
would make it better?

04:44.018 --> 04:45.717
If you put it
with some of this tea
right here.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.986
-A little tea?
-Yeah, you gotta mix it
with some tea, eh.

04:47.988 --> 04:48.920
[tim] I tell howard,

04:48.922 --> 04:50.022
the moonshine is good,

04:50.024 --> 04:52.291
but he needs to mix
the moonshine with some tea.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.226
Yeah. Put in the sweet tea
in this cup.

04:54.228 --> 04:55.827
-[howard] how much?
-[tim] it don't matter,

04:55.829 --> 04:58.130
because you gotta mix it
in your mouth.
Can't mix in the cup.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.232
-What?
-You gotta mix it like this.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.100
-So, you gotta, you know--
-I don't understand it.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.935
No you gotta do it
like this. Look.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.203
Mmm-hmm?

05:08.175 --> 05:12.144
And the technique is
don't fill your mouth up
with moonshine.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.946
Just get a little bit of it,
that's all you want.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.315
Mmm-hmm?

05:16.317 --> 05:19.151
You put some sweet tea
behind it and it kinda mixes
in your mouth.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.086
-[howard] well, lemme try it.
-[tim] you got that.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.155
Then you put there some
tea in there.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.956
Then you swallow
together, see like that.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.292
Yeah.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.794
You got the best palate ever.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.563
I mean, what,
what brought you to the damn,

05:31.565 --> 05:33.432
-sweet tea.
-That's my mom, did that.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.567
'cause I couldn't drink it,
it was too strong.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.436
<i>  Back in the day</i>
<i>  when I was young.</i>

05:37.438 --> 05:40.839
You know, I wanna be adult
and I can handle it, you know?

05:40.841 --> 05:42.007
But I couldn't do it.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.209
And my dad, he want you
to drink
that straight moonshine.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.913
So, you know
what the true taste it is,
what it tastes like.

05:47.915 --> 05:51.016
But then
when you went to swallow it,
phew, it was too much.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.684
So, she made me sweet tea
and she said,

05:52.686 --> 05:55.687
"that ain't cheating
'cause you still drinking
the moonshine."

05:55.689 --> 05:57.189
I do love sweet tea,

05:57.191 --> 05:58.623
I do love moonshine,

05:58.625 --> 06:01.026
the marriage of the two
together blows my mind.

06:01.028 --> 06:04.896
You oughta damn,
put this in a can and sell it
'cause this is amazing.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.332
I've put in jars and jugs,
but ain't done
putting it in a can.

06:07.334 --> 06:11.002
The rave nowadays, man,
is everybody's damn
making these drinks.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.138
They're making these
little shot...
Hot shots to call 'em.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.006
You blend the two together,
makes it perfect.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.575
It's like a marriage,

06:16.577 --> 06:19.344
and you sell this
stuff and you will, you will
make a killing off this.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.546
If you do a sweet tea
and moonshine together,

06:21.548 --> 06:23.882
-it's going to sell.
-You're right.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.016
Oh, I know.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.017
Howard's got a great idea,

06:26.019 --> 06:27.352
mixing it, putting it in a can

06:27.354 --> 06:30.088
and, you know, grab and go
and sell it
right off the shelf.

06:30.090 --> 06:33.325
But I've gotta find
some kind of way to replicate
that taste profile

06:33.327 --> 06:36.294
that I'm getting in my mouth,
but put it in a can.

06:36.296 --> 06:37.896
You can actually do this.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.598
Well, I got some guys
who can work on it,

06:39.600 --> 06:42.601
but I mean, you know, it's,
it's hard to get
that taste profile right.

06:51.245 --> 06:54.780
[amanda] boy, I can't believe
you guys just have walnuts
growing around here like this.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.416
-I don't have that
back home,
-[huck] really?

06:57.418 --> 07:01.420
No, and no kinds of nuts grow
unless you plant them,
you know.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.722
<i> [jeremy] in graham county,</i>
<i>  north carolina...</i>

07:03.724 --> 07:05.357
[amanda] kind of like
looking for easter eggs.

07:05.359 --> 07:06.992
<i> [jeremy] ...After</i>
<i>  joining forces</i>

07:06.994 --> 07:09.327
<i>  with moonshine innovator,</i>
<i>  amanda,</i>

07:09.329 --> 07:11.296
<i>  mark and huck gather</i>
<i>  fresh nuts</i>

07:11.298 --> 07:14.166
<i>  to make an infused liquor</i>
<i>  for a customer.</i>

07:14.168 --> 07:16.835
[amanda] I think
he'll like this,
and you guys will, too.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.837
[jason] I've been looking
for something
a little different.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.205
-[huck] something flavored?
-[jason] yeah.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.340
I'm looking to get it
pretty quick.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.743
I met amanda
<i> at master distiller.</i>

07:24.745 --> 07:25.977
She impressed me pretty good

07:25.979 --> 07:28.313
on the way she infused
the liquors and stuff,

07:28.315 --> 07:31.349
and got me to thinking
she can help me smooth
this stuff down

07:31.351 --> 07:34.252
maybe a walnut honey flavor.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.321
There you go.
That works.
Some walnuts.

07:36.323 --> 07:39.357
So, I got to see how mark
and huck do corn liquor,

07:39.359 --> 07:42.894
and I was really grateful
that they trusted me enough
to let me do that.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.262
So, an opportunity like this,

07:44.264 --> 07:45.864
it's really good for me
to see that,

07:45.866 --> 07:47.999
maybe I could teach
them a little bit
something as well.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.968
Should just need a few pounds
of these guys

07:49.970 --> 07:51.770
to flavor the liquor with.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.205
They're still green, though.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.140
That's okay.
They smell kinda citrusy,

07:55.142 --> 07:56.274
that it gives it more flavor

07:56.276 --> 07:58.577
like nocello,
italian walnut liquor.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.279
They actually use
green walnuts and
ripened walnuts in it.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.280
Oh.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.049
And you pick them
early in the season.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.818
When they're green,
they're softer
and they're full of juice,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.854
and it'll give us
a really good flavor profile.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.388
[mark 2] yeah,
I don't really understand,
you know,

08:10.390 --> 08:12.691
with nuts and stuff like that

08:12.693 --> 08:15.327
about making liquor,
'cause I never really
fooled with it.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.096
Nuts can be finicky
and really hard
to concentrate that flavor

08:18.098 --> 08:20.198
and have it infused
into the liquor in the end.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.335
Hopefully, this is exactly
what this guy is looking for.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.370
[huck] you think this'll
fix that liquor up, amanda?

08:25.372 --> 08:27.205
[amanda] I think it'll give it
a real good taste.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.708
We'll leave it up to you.
Let's just start
cracking some walnuts.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.543
Yeah,
and now the hard work starts.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.946
If she can get flavor out
of 'em, it might make
a good tasting liquor.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.314
I don't know.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.849
All right, guys,
now we gotta figure out

08:37.851 --> 08:40.185
some way to crack
these walnuts.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.454
-[huck] about that,
will that work?
-[amanda] perfect. Thank you.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.425
The other alcohol,
don't strip the taste of it?

08:47.427 --> 08:49.694
[amanda] you know
the alcohol is astringent,

08:49.696 --> 08:52.531
so it absorbs it
and it pulls it all out,

08:52.533 --> 08:55.133
flavor and the oils
and all the benefits.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.568
I never worried much about it.

08:56.570 --> 08:59.371
I just take a drink,
let my liver
separate everything.

09:01.308 --> 09:05.310
<i> [amanda] my idea is</i>
<i>  to just cook down</i>
<i>  the walnuts and the honey,</i>

09:05.312 --> 09:08.580
<i>  and essentially,</i>
<i>  we're just gonna make</i>
<i>  like an all natural-extract</i>

09:08.582 --> 09:11.316
<i>  and then use that to infuse</i>
<i>  the moonshine with.</i>

09:12.386 --> 09:15.253
[huck] phew. Well, it's
a lot of walnuts, amanda.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.422
[amanda] this is gonna be
our secret ingredient.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.324
I have some wildflower honey.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.393
[mark] so, you just
gonna cook that honey
in this.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.628
Well, it does smell good.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.869
[amanda] I'm gonna put a
little bit of water in there
and keep it from burning

09:30.871 --> 09:32.037
and the rest of the honey.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.506
So, we can light this up.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.708
We're gonna simmer it
till we've reduced the liquid
a little bit.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.711
The heat will help extract
all the flavor from
the walnuts into the honey,

09:39.713 --> 09:41.513
and we can add that
to the alcohol.

09:43.417 --> 09:47.085
All right, guys, I
think that's probably
simmered long enough.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.321
Well, smells good, mark.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.356
You get this flavor
in that liquor workin'?

09:51.358 --> 09:52.924
I got a trick.
I'm gonna show you.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.427
We can just let that cool down

09:55.429 --> 09:57.195
and we'll just mix
this with the alcohol.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.064
-[huck] okay.
-[amanda] we can pour it
in the alcohol,

09:59.066 --> 10:00.198
and it would absorb
the flavor,

10:00.200 --> 10:02.100
it'll probably take
a week or two

10:02.102 --> 10:04.369
for the alcohol, really,
to penetrate the solids.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.706
So, when you don't have
a lot of time,
this is the way to go.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.275
-Hmm.
-[amanda] so this is just
a whipped cream maker.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.711
You know,
in a regular restaurant,
you put cream in here.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.379
That's nitrogen dioxide.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.847
So, we're gonna pressurize

10:15.849 --> 10:20.018
and we're just gonna force
the alcohol into the walnuts

10:20.020 --> 10:24.456
and it'll just rapidly
speed up
the process of flavoring.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.091
<i> [huck] you know,</i>
<i>  this is confusing to me.</i>

10:26.093 --> 10:27.459
<i>  Damn, this thing</i>
<i>  I've ever seen.</i>

10:27.461 --> 10:29.894
She got
all kinds of little gadgets,

10:29.896 --> 10:31.930
<i>  trinkets, you know,</i>
<i>  little cups,</i>

10:31.932 --> 10:33.298
<i>  bottles of gas,</i>

10:33.300 --> 10:36.201
<i>  about like being in</i>
<i>  a science lab, you know.</i>

10:36.203 --> 10:39.170
<i> [amanda] we're gonna use</i>
<i>  no2 or nitrogen dioxide</i>

10:39.172 --> 10:42.207
<i>  in the whipped cream canister</i>
<i>  and pressurize</i>

10:42.209 --> 10:44.109
and then feel it, it got cold.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.944
-Oh! We do.
-[amanda] and we're gonna
force the liquor

10:45.946 --> 10:47.646
right into
the hard part of the nuts.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.748
Best way to learn
is to do it yourself,
right, mark?

10:49.750 --> 10:51.449
-[mark 2] yeah.
-[amanda] the more you
shake it too,

10:51.451 --> 10:53.451
it's forcing
a millions of little bubbles
in here.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.353
Mmm, howdy.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.988
<i> [amanda] and then we just</i>
<i>  let that sit</i>

10:56.990 --> 10:59.357
<i>  under the pressure</i>
<i>  for like 10 to 20 minutes.</i>

11:01.028 --> 11:03.061
Now the fancy part,

11:03.063 --> 11:04.796
we put
a ton of pressure on there,

11:04.798 --> 11:06.297
when we release the pressure,

11:06.299 --> 11:08.099
it's gonna be
like a second pressurization.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.402
So, two times
it's gonna force flavor.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.303
[mark 2] sounded like
a cap started leaking,
didn't it?

11:12.305 --> 11:14.639
[huck] yeah [laughs]
pretty fun.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.142
Science, you know.
You wanna see
how much bubbles is coming?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.210
-[huck] oh yeah.
-[amanda] so, we've
essentially carbonated it,

11:19.212 --> 11:20.545
but we do it with nitrogen.

11:20.547 --> 11:23.381
-Rapid infusion 101.
-I hear you,
but I still don't understand.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.884
[amanda] it all will
make sense when you finally
taste it in the end.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.119
We gotta let this stuff
set overnight,

11:28.121 --> 11:29.821
she says,
we'll really be a believer

11:29.823 --> 11:32.357
when we see
the other end of it.
Don't know.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.125
I'm still wondering
about it.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.228
Cap these off and
check 'em out tomorrow.

11:47.841 --> 11:52.010
This is
our favorite, old site, beaz.
I love it here.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.812
We're going back
to our old still site.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.314
<i>  There's no evidence</i>
<i>  that it's ever been burnt.</i>

11:56.316 --> 11:59.284
Nobody around.
Nobody's been here
that we can tell.

11:59.286 --> 12:02.787
[beaz] well, it's a pain
getting back here,
for one thing.

12:02.789 --> 12:05.056
[digger] I mean, really,
is your wife worth it?

12:05.058 --> 12:10.361
Yeah. Her credit score, man,
is way up there.
I gotta treat her right.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.931
You know, killer beaz,
he's all time up to something,

12:12.933 --> 12:16.434
and he's trying to make
a special shine for terry,

12:16.436 --> 12:18.336
who is his wife's birthday.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.271
<i>  Gonna help him,</i>
<i>  we're excited about it.</i>

12:20.273 --> 12:24.042
And we'll get mashed in
with his version
of what he calls ambrosia.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.715
[tim] you know,
back in the day,

12:30.717 --> 12:34.219
we always had
sweet tea chaser moonshine.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.154
I want
everybody else to
experience that too.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.923
I'm headed to
north carolina,
meet with chad.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.726
Chad is actually the guy
who helped me
with the wood-fired whiskey.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.261
[tim] are y'all sure
about this thing?

12:43.263 --> 12:47.031
<i> [chad] so, this system here</i>
<i>  turns moonshine</i>
<i>  into aged whiskey.</i>

12:47.033 --> 12:48.199
-[tim] that's good.
-That's real good.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.135
<i> [tim] he's like</i>
<i>  a mad scientist at,</i>

12:50.137 --> 12:53.304
<i>  at blending and mixing</i>
<i>  stuff together</i>
<i>  and making things happen.</i>

12:53.306 --> 12:56.374
He's the genius, you know?
And, and if anyone
can do this,

12:56.376 --> 12:57.509
chad can.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.046
Well, well.

13:02.048 --> 13:05.183
-How you doin', chad, huh?
-How you doin' man?

13:05.185 --> 13:07.318
-[chad] come by to bartend
or something today?
-Yeah.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.820
Well, I got a bright idea.

13:08.822 --> 13:12.357
Sweet tea and moonshine,
if I could, you know,
commercialize this

13:12.359 --> 13:15.493
bottle it, can it.
I think I got something
to bring to market.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.396
First,
you gotta experience this.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.098
<i>  Now I gotta get</i>
<i>  chad on board.</i>

13:20.100 --> 13:22.467
He needs to go ahead
and do the ritual.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.568
Mmm.

13:23.603 --> 13:26.571
<i>  The ritual is putting</i>
<i>  moonshine in your mouth,</i>

13:26.573 --> 13:28.206
<i>  taking a drink of sweet tea,</i>

13:28.208 --> 13:30.341
mixing it
and swallowing it together.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.509
All right, look, you do it.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.077
-Take the moonshine first.
-Yeah.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.712
[tim] moonshine's first.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.114
-Mmm?
-Mmm.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.252
-That's interesting.
-[tim] it changes it.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.288
Yeah, it does.
I did not expect it
to change it that much.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.089
-This is my vision.
-[chad] okay.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.959
How can we sell it like this
commercially,

13:47.961 --> 13:50.028
but tastes like
I just showed you
what it tastes like?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.362
I need chad to figure out,

13:51.364 --> 13:55.900
why if I mix sweet tea
and moonshine together
in my mouth,

13:55.902 --> 13:58.503
why does it taste
so much different
with the same product.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.438
You could have
a higher-end product

14:00.440 --> 14:03.741
than 99.9% of the people
on the market.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.142
This is exciting.

14:05.144 --> 14:07.212
Think about we're gonna
make something nobody
else have ever made.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.681
We're gonna bring
the backwoods
to the commercial line.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.683
Every racetrack,
tailgate porter

14:11.685 --> 14:13.017
-in the whole united states...
-Yup.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.052
...Is gonna want this.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.521
Grab-and-go cocktail,
ready to go.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.923
-Oh, like the whole rtd thing
that's taken off.
-Yeah.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.292
The ready-to-drink cocktail.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.094
This is the hot thing
going right now.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.430
When you go into a store,
this is what you see.

14:25.432 --> 14:29.133
You see these grab-and-go,
the rtds,
they're ready to drink.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.902
So, we're talking,

14:30.904 --> 14:34.038
aluminum can,
high-end cocktail,
ready to go.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.007
The only difference
will be the temperature,

14:36.009 --> 14:39.344
but it will taste
exactly the same
as it does when it's warm.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.812
But, you think
you can do it, all right?

14:40.814 --> 14:42.180
[chad] uh, yes I think so.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.182
Good.
See, I knew you could do it.
I knew you could.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.183
That's why I got you.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.384
Wha... Wha... What about,
how long,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.019
uh, is it gonna take you
to get it done?

14:48.021 --> 14:50.288
Gimme two weeks.
I'll, I'll have it done
in two weeks.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.957
<i> [tim] I told chad the ritual,</i>
<i>  how to taste it and drink it.</i>

14:52.959 --> 14:54.392
He knows the taste profile,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.995
but now the science,
he's gotta figure that out.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.963
-Let's do it. You got this.
-All right.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.439
<i> [mark 1] man,</i>
<i>  it's nice back here.</i>

15:08.441 --> 15:11.242
[digger] see look how pretty
it is when you get that seed
out there,

15:11.244 --> 15:12.377
and now just so you'll know,

15:12.379 --> 15:13.978
I mean, we're gonna
use some enzymes,

15:13.980 --> 15:16.681
-they break this down.
-[beaz] mmm-hmm.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.716
That's what them enzymes do.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.719
So, I chew pieces up
and spit 'em in the...

15:21.721 --> 15:23.621
No, the enzymes
are doing the chewing.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.056
Oh, okay.

15:25.058 --> 15:29.394
Beaz, he wants a special
birthday brandy
for his wife, terry.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.528
Our job here

15:30.530 --> 15:32.931
is just to make sure
that this isn't
a total failure.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.365
[beaz] this is actually
kinda fun.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.101
So, we're gonna be using
scuppnines,

15:37.103 --> 15:41.272
bananas, figs,
kiwifruit and peaches.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.007
-Just so you know...
-Yeah.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.076
...When you make liquor
out of fruit,

15:45.078 --> 15:48.513
-[beaz] yes.
-It's
a time consuming project.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.981
Let me see here.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.984
Oh, dang.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.419
Once you get into
a psa?

15:54.421 --> 15:56.888
-Uh, yeah, oh...
-Oh, we're in
a yellowjackets' nest.

15:56.890 --> 15:59.524
No [bleep]

16:00.894 --> 16:02.627
<i> -[beaz] crap.</i>
<i> -[mark 1] they're protective</i>
<i>  as hell</i>

16:02.629 --> 16:03.861
<i>  of their domain.</i>

16:03.863 --> 16:05.797
<i> [digger] you're getting ready</i>
<i>  to blackout or anything?</i>

16:05.799 --> 16:08.933
[beaz] no, but I'm gonna walk
up to the truck and see--

16:08.935 --> 16:10.601
-[digger] hey beaz.
-[beaz] I wanna look
at this...

16:10.603 --> 16:12.003
Shortcut route through here.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.671
[beaz] I mean,
I don't know this path.
I'll get lost

16:13.673 --> 16:15.239
and then I'll die.

16:15.241 --> 16:16.941
Poor son of a bitch.

16:16.943 --> 16:20.044
It's kinda ironic
that a yellowjacket
would sting somebody

16:20.046 --> 16:21.346
named killer beaz.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.949
Well, do they know
that they're trespassing
on our still site?

16:24.951 --> 16:27.085
Go over and tell them.
You gotta get really close.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.686
-Yellowjackets'
-now they've got good ears.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.021
[mark 1] they've
got some good ears.

16:30.023 --> 16:31.723
They got great
eyes, no good ears.

16:31.725 --> 16:32.824
<i> [digger] beaz, he's,</i>

16:32.826 --> 16:36.828
he's, he's incapacitated
at this point.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.863
-[mark 1] damn it.
<i> -[digger] so, it's up to</i>
<i>  me and mark</i>

16:38.865 --> 16:40.264
to go on a recon mission

16:40.266 --> 16:44.168
and slip in
behind the enemy lines
and get this mash out.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.704
[mark 1] well, let's get this
damn mash made.

16:49.476 --> 16:52.310
This just like
you getting stung.
That's the pits.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.014
[beaz] such a wordsmith.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.550
I'll tell you what, guys,
terry is gonna love this.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.886
Aw! We thank the world
for terry.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.055
I mean, she's gotta be
nominated for sainthood,

17:04.057 --> 17:06.190
hell she lives
and puts up with you.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.760
Quit eating the damn bananas

17:08.828 --> 17:11.929
it ain't gonna have no
banana flavor
if you eat all of them.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.899
You've begrudged me one bite
of one little banana.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.934
[digger] one bite? Hell, far,
you looked like

17:16.936 --> 17:19.137
"debbie does dallas"
when you took that bite.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.710
[laughter]

17:25.712 --> 17:28.379
well, I've got all
the peaches, I reckon
that's all of it.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.182
[beaz] excellent. Oh, wait,
wait, wait, the scuppnines.

17:31.184 --> 17:34.452
-Oh, that's your
secret ingredient.
-[beaz] yes, it is.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.155
All right, let's get her.
Let's get something cooking.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.391
<i> [beaz] they've got</i>
<i>  a killer flavor,</i>

17:40.393 --> 17:44.829
it tastes like a grape
that has allspice or something
in it.

17:44.831 --> 17:48.132
So, this is
kind of my major ingredient

17:48.134 --> 17:50.368
-for this was scoring the
the scuppnine.
-You want this to

17:50.370 --> 17:52.170
be the dominant flavor?

17:53.006 --> 17:55.506
Maybe. I've never
run this before.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.708
[mark 1] we ain't never made
no liquor with them.
Have we digger?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.010
[digger] we have not.

17:59.012 --> 18:02.046
Who's to say that,
that wouldn't make
a standalone liquor?

18:02.048 --> 18:03.815
Well, kind of what
I'mma thinking.

18:03.817 --> 18:07.151
[digger] let's see
how the flavor comes through
on them on this little run.

18:07.153 --> 18:10.788
But one thing I'm certain of,
you gotta have
a little pectic enzyme.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.491
It will break down this fruit
and liquefy it a little more.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.460
Basically, what it's doing,
it's pre-chewing up

18:15.462 --> 18:17.962
the carbohydrates
and proteins in here.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.230
They'll make
everything break down,

18:19.232 --> 18:23.000
like the amylase enzyme
does to corn.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.902
[beaz] and we're using
corn syrup

18:24.904 --> 18:28.039
instead of granulated
cane sugar.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.741
We brought corn
syrup into this mash

18:30.743 --> 18:33.978
<i>  simply because it's</i>
<i>  100 percent fermentable.</i>

18:33.980 --> 18:35.580
<i>  And anybody that's</i>
<i>  made corn liquor knows</i>

18:35.582 --> 18:38.983
that corn flavor
is sweet in liquor.

18:38.985 --> 18:42.920
So, we're not just getting
sugar liquor, we're getting
corn sugar, liquor.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.188
All that needs right now

18:44.190 --> 18:46.924
-baby man is, yeast.
-No, you need
way more than that.

18:46.926 --> 18:50.194
We want
to kick off quick.
We want it to work out fast.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.063
You know,
this is a complicated mash.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.298
-We're done here, let's...
-[digger] let's go.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.334
I like all the fruit
that's in it.

18:56.336 --> 19:00.104
But when you combine
all these, who knows
what you're gonna develop,

19:00.106 --> 19:02.240
what kind of taste profile
you're gonna get.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.342
Get your cooler here
dip [bleep]

19:04.344 --> 19:08.346
-oh. Is that
polite to say to somebody?
-[digger] I mean, beaz.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.514
[mark 1 laughs]

19:18.725 --> 19:19.857
<i> [amanda] all right, guys.</i>

19:19.859 --> 19:21.292
These are the filters
that I brought for us

19:21.294 --> 19:24.862
to filter
the honey walnut moonshine
with.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.132
We just let that alcohol
and the walnuts
steep together overnight.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.100
All the solids
should've settled

19:29.102 --> 19:31.235
and the fats risen to the top.

19:31.237 --> 19:33.905
So, we're just gonna build,
you know, basically like
a simple water filter

19:33.907 --> 19:35.406
like you would have
in your house.

19:35.408 --> 19:40.144
Amanda brought
all kinds of filters,
and blinds, and pumps.

19:40.146 --> 19:43.614
These are micron filters.
Five microns is the rating,

19:43.616 --> 19:45.183
so it means how tightly
they're bound.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.818
It's just cotton bound up
real, real tight.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.288
Hopefully,
we can pump our infusion

19:50.290 --> 19:53.491
through the filters
and we'll have it
all nice and clear in the end.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.293
Let's see how
this settled overnight.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.228
-[mark 2] got a good flavor.
-It does.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.398
Now, all we have to
do is get the clear
liquor back out of here

20:00.400 --> 20:02.033
and leave the flavor in it.

20:02.035 --> 20:03.968
Step one, we'll attach
this to something,

20:03.970 --> 20:06.070
and then we'll just build
everything off of this.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.339
<i>  I'm pretty confident that</i>
<i>  the micron filters will work.</i>

20:08.341 --> 20:11.108
I've used them numerous
times on a small scale.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.977
It's gonna go
into this chamber,

20:12.979 --> 20:14.912
filter it out one time,
second time.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.714
We're gonna use
the water recirculating pump

20:16.716 --> 20:19.350
and that'll force the alcohol
through this filter here.

20:19.352 --> 20:23.221
Yeah just like
fixing a rig, something that'd
give us dialysis or something.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.856
I need a bucket to collect
our filtered alcohol in.

20:25.858 --> 20:26.924
<i>  I love this stuff.</i>

20:26.926 --> 20:28.893
<i>  It's still this bad as</i>
<i>  it was the day before,</i>

20:28.895 --> 20:32.496
it's gonna take something
to strain that out.
I'll tell you.

20:32.498 --> 20:35.299
-Look like a muddy mess to me.
-[huck] it makes me nervous.

20:35.301 --> 20:36.968
I think they might
be a little bit scared

20:36.970 --> 20:38.703
at what we're doing
and how it's gonna look.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.438
<i>  In theory, it should</i>
<i>  just filter perfectly.</i>

20:40.440 --> 20:42.807
But when you're
building and inventing,

20:42.809 --> 20:45.309
you know, there's a lot
of trial and error that
goes along with that.

20:45.311 --> 20:47.511
Ready. All right.
I'm feeling good
about this guys.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.115
It's working.

20:51.117 --> 20:54.585
This filter needs a second
to get saturated.
Let's see.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.889
Oh. Damn.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.925
Worked for a minute,
didn't it?

21:00.927 --> 21:02.026
[amanda] son of a bitch.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.163
It's working.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.033
-Damn.
-Worked for a minute,
didn't it?

21:09.035 --> 21:11.269
[amanda] son of a bitch.

21:11.271 --> 21:14.038
-[mark 2] did that lock?
-[amanda]
unplug it for a second.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.675
Let me ask the question,

21:17.677 --> 21:20.711
-since that's got all them
nuts and everything in it...
-Yup.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.180
...Would it be better
to strain that into
another bucket, and

21:23.182 --> 21:25.950
-then shoot it
through them filters?
-It may be.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.885
[huck] 'cause that's a lot
of solids in there.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.820
-[amanda] yeah.
<i> -[mark 2] pump's cloggin' up.</i>

21:29.822 --> 21:32.423
I think she can
straighten everything
and I hope she can.

21:32.425 --> 21:35.693
My job here now is
to prove to them
that a little bit of science,

21:35.695 --> 21:37.428
a little bit of old
school techniques,

21:37.430 --> 21:39.196
a little bit of new school
techniques together,

21:39.198 --> 21:40.498
and we can solve problems.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.800
Ready? The moment of truth.

21:42.802 --> 21:43.968
Take two.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.275
Oh, my god,
it's actually working.

21:51.277 --> 21:52.343
That is amazing.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.312
Ooh. Oh, god.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.814
Everything in the filters
was cloudy,

21:56.816 --> 21:58.115
and I thought, there's no way

21:58.117 --> 22:00.017
this is gonna come out
clear on the other end,

22:00.019 --> 22:01.118
but it did.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.254
Oh. [chuckles]

22:03.256 --> 22:04.455
that alcohol burns.

22:04.457 --> 22:05.589
Get it in the eye?

22:06.459 --> 22:08.092
Tastes good tough.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.927
[amanda] all right.
One more bucket.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.362
-[mark 2] one more bucket.
-[amanda] okay.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.898
What do you think, guys?

22:13.900 --> 22:15.166
-Working.
-[huck] working.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.134
[mark 2] god, I never would've
believed it.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.236
Comin' out nice and clear.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.404
[huck] look at that.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.442
[amanda] well, it looks good.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.676
Moment of truth.

22:30.316 --> 22:32.383
[amanda] need your
honest opinion, guys.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.787
We may not want to sell this.

22:36.789 --> 22:37.988
May wanna keep it.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.058
-What do you think?
-We might not sell.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.094
It's absolutely perfect.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.628
<i>  It's good and clear.</i>

22:44.630 --> 22:46.997
It still had the same
kick about it.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.933
Not bad.
You think he's gonna like it?

22:48.935 --> 22:51.802
If he don't like it
right there.
You can't make him happy.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.305
I'm pretty confident
that the customer's
gonna love it.

22:54.307 --> 22:57.208
If he doesn't, mark and huck
can keep it
and sell it to someone else

22:57.210 --> 22:58.442
because it's delicious.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.678
I'm probably fixing
to say something dumb,

23:00.680 --> 23:02.446
if I am, you just tell me.

23:02.448 --> 23:05.783
Could we not do something
like that on a bigger scale?

23:05.785 --> 23:07.017
[amanda] that would work.

23:07.019 --> 23:10.121
Me and huck usually
we get to think
about something...

23:10.123 --> 23:12.690
If we could get
a whole lot bigger scale,

23:12.692 --> 23:15.993
make a lot more liquor,
you know, and put in
a real good flavor,

23:15.995 --> 23:17.261
<i>  it'd be a money-maker.</i>

23:17.263 --> 23:20.398
Making liquor with these
seasoned vets of moonshining,

23:20.400 --> 23:22.233
<i>  is beyond anything</i>
<i>  that I could have asked for.</i>

23:22.235 --> 23:24.201
Knowledge is really
a shared thing.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.303
You share it with
someone else.
They share it with you.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.139
And that's how you learn
and you grow.

23:28.141 --> 23:31.308
In the meanwhile, let's see
if we make jason happy now
and get us some money.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.544
I'll guarantee
we'll make him happy.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.955
[tim] today, I'm going down
to see chad.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.224
Chad's been working
on my flavor profile

23:47.226 --> 23:49.193
for the sweet tea moonshine.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.862
<i>  Chad calls me up. He says,</i>
<i>  "hey, I got it."</i>

23:51.864 --> 23:52.997
he's done did his magic.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.365
He done did his science.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.300
<i>  He's done figured out</i>
<i>  the taste profile.</i>

23:56.302 --> 23:58.269
So, I can't wait to taste it.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.106
Chad. I'm excited, man.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.308
I wanna taste what you got,
what you're working with here.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.544
You only gave me two weeks,
remember, you gave me
two weeks.

24:06.546 --> 24:10.381
So, I'm still, like,
trying to nail this,
but I think I've got it.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.952
<i> [chad] this has actually been</i>
<i>  the longest</i>
<i>  two weeks of my life,</i>

24:14.954 --> 24:17.421
I've consumed hundreds
of gallons of sweet tea

24:17.423 --> 24:19.290
and I can't tell you
how much moonshine

24:19.292 --> 24:21.292
<i>  and I finally think</i>
<i>  I have something.</i>

24:21.294 --> 24:23.160
So, what I did is
I took this sweet tea...

24:23.162 --> 24:24.962
-Sweet tea and moonshine--
-I see that.
...And moonshine. Yeah.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.231
You remember when we
were talking about
the, um, ritual thing...

24:27.233 --> 24:29.099
-Yeah.
-...The difference that you,
put it in your mouth

24:29.101 --> 24:30.668
-and hold it and the tea...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.836
-...And then you drink it.
-Yeah.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.137
But then you
pour it in a glass...

24:33.139 --> 24:34.705
-It's different.
-It tastes totally different.

24:34.707 --> 24:36.140
-So...
-Yeah.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.209
...This is mimicking
like if somebody left it
open for a little while,

24:38.211 --> 24:40.878
we'll see what it would
taste like when it's
exposed to the oxygen.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.481
Then I made
a highly-concentrated
lemon juice,

24:43.483 --> 24:44.648
and we'll add it
to it like that.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.417
Try it and see
what you think.

24:46.419 --> 24:50.154
All right, you got a drink.
I got a drink. Cheers. Yup.
All right.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.194
Not too bad.
A little bit lemony.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.396
You know,
I... I taste the sweet tea,

24:59.398 --> 25:01.932
a little bit of the moonshine,
but I'm tasting
a whole lot of lemon.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.101
Well you gotta put
some more moonshine in there.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.837
You gotta, you know,
do something with it,
you know?

25:06.839 --> 25:09.974
-You think the lemon,
cut back on lemon?
-Yeah. Cut back on the lemon.

25:09.976 --> 25:12.343
Well, that was...
We'll mix some.

25:12.345 --> 25:14.712
<i> [tim] you know,</i>
<i>  we're gonna have to tweak it</i>
<i>  a little bit better.</i>

25:14.714 --> 25:16.180
<i>  We got to get</i>
<i>  a little bit closer</i>

25:16.182 --> 25:18.015
<i>  because this is</i>
<i>  not it right now.</i>

25:18.017 --> 25:20.484
It just doesn't have
that right taste profile.

25:20.486 --> 25:22.419
[chad] I'll just drop
the mls in half.

25:22.421 --> 25:24.889
So now we're gonna do
four and a half
instead of nine,

25:24.891 --> 25:27.391
-half of the lemon.
-Put this in here.

25:27.393 --> 25:29.860
And then I see he's
got a jar of the tea

25:29.862 --> 25:31.829
<i>  and the moonshine.</i>
<i>  He's got everything</i>
<i>  in front of him.</i>

25:31.831 --> 25:33.230
<i>  He's got it all right there.</i>

25:33.232 --> 25:36.066
So, I just basically
start just mixing
some stuff together.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.201
[chad] see what this is like.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.338
Mmm. That's pretty good, eh.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.841
-See, I kinda dilute it
with that moonshine.
-Yeah.

25:43.843 --> 25:46.043
But, but when I put
the moonshine,
I raised the proof.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.177
-Let's see.
-[tim] so that's the thing

25:47.179 --> 25:49.046
we gotta keep strong enough,

25:49.048 --> 25:51.949
but a good taste profile,
but I wanna taste
the sweet tea.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.018
[chad] okay,
that's 21% alcohol.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.020
So, we're really,
really close, so...

25:56.022 --> 25:57.421
I'm actually smelling it.

25:57.423 --> 25:59.690
I'm tasting it
and I'm looking at it.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.458
So, I... I'm taking those
three characteristics

26:01.460 --> 26:03.294
that, what I learned
growing up.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.563
Look, try some of that.

26:05.565 --> 26:06.931
Mmm?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.799
It's actually not bad.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.568
I just put a little this
and a little that, uh,

26:10.570 --> 26:12.002
a dab of that
and a pinch of this,

26:12.004 --> 26:12.937
and once I tweaked it,

26:12.939 --> 26:14.505
I got it.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.340
-I still don't know
what you put in it, though.
-Well, I don't know neither.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.841
I took some of this,

26:17.843 --> 26:20.311
-it was about half
a tube of this out of that...
-[chad laughs]

26:20.313 --> 26:22.846
...And I put it here and
there's other two things
you had sitting here,

26:22.848 --> 26:25.416
-I put that in there,
whatever that is.
-It's like a five?

26:25.418 --> 26:27.618
-Yeah, I did a five,
I don't know--
-of which one?

26:28.487 --> 26:30.888
-It was a five of this one.
-So, five on that

26:30.890 --> 26:32.122
-came from this?
-[tim] yup.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.958
Okay. Let's start there.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.894
But, this thing was like full.

26:36.896 --> 26:39.496
So, you poured that in.
You didn't...

26:39.498 --> 26:41.265
-I poured this in there.
-[chad] okay.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.866
I just didn't write it down.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.234
Chad has to go back
in reverse.

26:44.236 --> 26:46.503
<i>  He's gotta pull that,</i>
<i>  what I put in that drawer.</i>

26:46.505 --> 26:48.105
<i>  You know,</i>
<i>  chad's got the paper</i>
<i>  and the pen.</i>

26:48.107 --> 26:51.241
All he's gotta do is
look at what I'm doing
and take some measurements

26:51.243 --> 26:53.110
<i>  and you pull it right back</i>
<i>  out write it down,</i>

26:53.112 --> 26:55.346
and, you know, you got it.

26:55.348 --> 26:58.115
-Actually it is really good.
<i> -[tim] looks good,</i>
<i>  it smells good.</i>

26:58.117 --> 26:59.950
<i>  And the next thing,</i>
<i>  we're gonna be canning</i>
<i>  this stuff.</i>

26:59.952 --> 27:01.085
I'm excited.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.920
-You're signing off.
This is good to go?
-Good.

27:02.922 --> 27:03.988
-We're good. That's it?
-Yeah.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.422
-Call me when it
get it ready.
-I'll call you

27:05.424 --> 27:07.458
-when we're ready to can,
all right?
<i> -[tim] see you.</i>

27:10.329 --> 27:14.031
[digger] look right here,
baby man.
We may be ambitious.

27:14.033 --> 27:17.801
[beaz] this is gonna mean
a lot to her that you guys
helped do this.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.371
Beaz, he's got
a skip in his step today.

27:20.373 --> 27:23.140
[digger] oh, looky here.
Oh yeah.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.842
[beaz] nice.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.978
That's sweet, that's sour...

27:27.980 --> 27:31.682
Today's the day
we're gonna run his
birthday present for terry.

27:31.684 --> 27:32.883
Wow!

27:32.885 --> 27:34.318
She is gonna have a...

27:34.320 --> 27:37.221
I hope it comes out tasting
anything like that.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.857
We took the lid off
that mash barrel.

27:39.859 --> 27:40.858
We tasted it

27:40.860 --> 27:42.693
and it had that wine

27:42.695 --> 27:46.230
that, that fruit wine taste,
with a lot of alcohol,

27:46.232 --> 27:47.831
you could feel the proof.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.134
-That's some fine mash.
-[digger] yes, it is.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.302
I can't believe though
he's lucky enough.

27:52.304 --> 27:54.038
As sweet as it was
and all that fruit

27:54.040 --> 27:56.106
we didn't attract a bear.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.842
Usually, if you've got
good mash,
you'll have good liquor.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.145
So you're getting down
to the fruit now.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.480
<i> [digger] that being said,</i>
<i>  this mash tastes wonderful.</i>

28:03.482 --> 28:06.083
If it had a little bit
of sweet whipped cream in it,

28:06.085 --> 28:09.119
it would taste
just like ambrosia salad.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.589
A lot of times
you should cut the torch on.

28:12.591 --> 28:15.359
[mark 1] give it a 10 count
and then put the flame to it.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.694
[mark 1 laughs]

28:19.265 --> 28:20.864
gee...

28:20.866 --> 28:24.134
[digger] we're gonna
have to put you through
101 school again.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.270
Being a small batch,
one of run,

28:26.272 --> 28:29.039
<i>  we're just gonna use</i>
<i>  a little old small</i>
<i>  30 gallon steel</i>

28:29.041 --> 28:31.208
and make quick work of this.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.443
-Killer?
-Yeah, man.

28:32.445 --> 28:34.311
Me and digger took a vote,

28:34.313 --> 28:36.947
we decided, you're gonna get
an additional lesson

28:36.949 --> 28:39.416
-in condensation.
-Nice.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.352
-Nice.
-Instead of catching
the heads in a jar

28:42.354 --> 28:44.254
and throwing them off,
we're just gonna leave

28:44.256 --> 28:48.425
the, the cooling tub empty,
void of water.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.294
-Okay.
-And let it

28:50.296 --> 28:53.163
push all the vapors out
and out the worm.

28:53.165 --> 28:57.167
It'll clean out the worm.
It'll clean out the worm arm

28:57.169 --> 28:59.369
and blow the heads up.

28:59.371 --> 29:03.140
[mark 1] you'll see if go
from steam coming out
of the worm

29:03.142 --> 29:06.110
and turning into liquid,
which will be your liquor.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.679
We want beaz
to see the transformation

29:08.681 --> 29:10.614
from steam to liquid.

29:10.616 --> 29:13.317
And this steam in there,
here I wanna show you.

29:13.319 --> 29:16.353
-[beaz] oh, okay.
-[mark 1] see that steam
coming way out here?

29:16.355 --> 29:19.189
It'll always condense
a little on its own.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.824
-Right, right.
-[mark 1] see how
it just

29:20.826 --> 29:23.060
-spurting now having it going.
-[beaz] uh-huh.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.829
-This is your head's
going up in there.
-Got you.

29:25.831 --> 29:28.332
[mark 1] I'm gonna introduce
water to it slowly

29:28.334 --> 29:31.602
and you'll see the steam
go completely away.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.238
[beaz] well, that's hot
in there, isn't it?

29:34.240 --> 29:37.241
[mark 1] you ain't teasing,
it's hot in there.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.443
Now, looky here. See
what it's done to our stream?

29:39.445 --> 29:41.011
Right, right.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.847
Yep. I'm seeing
very little.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.015
Nothing.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.850
[mark 1] ain't that crazy?

29:46.852 --> 29:51.789
[digger] instantly when, when
that entire worm is,
is engulfed in cold water,

29:51.791 --> 29:54.825
it immediately goes from
a vapor to a stream of liquor.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.860
-[mark 1] but it's coming?
-[beaz] yeah, it is.

29:56.862 --> 29:59.196
Swap 'em jars,
hell, you're wasting liquor.

29:59.198 --> 30:02.199
-[mark 1] crystal clear,
ain't it?
-[beaz] yes, it is, brother.

30:02.201 --> 30:05.035
[mark 1] that ought to be
full of flavor.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.937
Whoa! Scuppernong.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.939
-[digger] scuppernong.
-[beaz] scuppernong.

30:08.941 --> 30:13.110
There's always
the moment of truth
when you taste the rum.

30:15.214 --> 30:18.081
-Holy!
-Mackerel king fish.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.884
What stands out
most to me is...

30:20.886 --> 30:25.255
The taste of the scuppernongs
seem to outrun
the other fruits,

30:25.257 --> 30:27.257
which is really a good flavor.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.793
[digger] man,
that's outstanding.

30:29.795 --> 30:34.231
-Wow.
-That grape, wild grape
scuppernong flavor,

30:34.233 --> 30:38.335
it's in there
through to through, you know
front to back, it's great.

30:38.337 --> 30:44.174
I think terry
is gonna absolutely
love this moonshine.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.076
She's gonna be so surprised.

30:46.078 --> 30:48.011
Really amazes me

30:48.013 --> 30:50.514
that no more of the peach
comes through.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.982
-I mean, I taste them...
-Yeah.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.650
...Scuppernongs...

30:53.652 --> 30:55.018
-Scuppernong.
-...More than anything.

30:55.020 --> 30:58.989
I mean, really,
that's the damn,
that's the dominant flavor

30:58.991 --> 31:01.792
even though they didn't,
weren't the most volume.

31:01.794 --> 31:03.360
Right, right.

31:03.362 --> 31:06.196
They would make
a dandy wine, wouldn't it?

31:06.198 --> 31:07.564
I'm sure.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.200
Tell you what,
they'd make dandy
and that's brandy

31:11.770 --> 31:14.137
or cognac, cognac.

31:24.149 --> 31:27.150
[mark 2] oh, I hope
he likes this stuff,
it good.

31:27.152 --> 31:29.052
-[huck] I'll tell you what...
-[mark 2] yeah?

31:29.054 --> 31:32.389
...If he don't like it
right there, he just...
Can't make him happy.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.690
That's right.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.792
[huck] that's good stuff,
good flavor.

31:35.794 --> 31:38.228
<i> [mark 2] yeah, we're taking</i>
<i>  this liquor</i>
<i>  out here to jason.</i>

31:38.230 --> 31:41.064
<i>  He's wanting a</i>
<i>  different flavor.</i>

31:41.066 --> 31:45.068
I don't know anybody
who's got any
walnut-flavored moonshine.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.403
<i>  He oughta be happy with it.</i>

31:48.007 --> 31:50.941
Yeah, there he comes.
Done good, didn't we?

31:57.816 --> 32:00.083
-Hi there, bud.
-Hello, jason.

32:00.085 --> 32:01.518
-[jason speaking]
-good, you?

32:01.520 --> 32:05.222
[jason speaking]

32:05.224 --> 32:08.292
-that busy?
-[jason speaking]

32:08.294 --> 32:10.928
-[huck] I bet
you're gonna like that.
-[jason speaking]

32:10.930 --> 32:12.629
[huck] think he loves that.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.899
-[mark 2] a lot of hard work
in that.
-[huck] yeah.

32:15.901 --> 32:18.568
You wouldn't believe
what we have been through
to get that flavour.

32:24.710 --> 32:28.111
[jason speaking]

32:28.113 --> 32:29.646
[huck] is that what you're
looking for?

32:29.648 --> 32:32.382
[jason speaking]

32:32.384 --> 32:35.118
[mark 2] that's what you want.
We've got your ten gallon.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.054
-[jason speaking]
-[huck] looks like we had to
to go up

32:37.056 --> 32:39.790
on a little bit, 'cause
we got a lot of work in it,
you know?

32:39.792 --> 32:42.426
$1500,
that's ten gallon.

32:42.428 --> 32:45.329
You still make money on that
if you want to resell it.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.998
Especially type of people
you deal with.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.001
[jason speaking]

32:51.003 --> 32:53.170
-[huck] all right.
-[mark 2] you got cash,
I'll get you it.

33:03.315 --> 33:06.149
-[jason speaking]
-[mark 2] yeah, boy.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.385
That's a lot of money
right there.

33:08.387 --> 33:09.686
[huck] yeah, I trust you.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.288
-[mark 2]
we'll be talking at you.
-[jason speaking]

33:11.290 --> 33:13.357
-[mark 2] all right, see ya.
-[jason speaking]

33:17.062 --> 33:18.261
<i> [mark 2] the sale</i>
<i>  went really good.</i>

33:18.263 --> 33:20.397
The man that worked hard,

33:20.399 --> 33:22.466
and I figure half the
money's gonna be hers.

33:22.468 --> 33:25.469
-[huck] got no hesitation
paying a foot.
-[mark 2] no.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.414
[tim] gettin' back down here
and see chad.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.950
We're gonna put this
sweet tea
and moonshine in a can

33:39.952 --> 33:41.718
get it out to, to the market.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.756
Get it out to
some of the retail stores
and make some money.

33:45.758 --> 33:48.025
We got the formula.
We submitted it
to the government.

33:48.027 --> 33:50.694
<i>  We got it approved.</i>
<i>  Where my man, chad at?</i>

33:50.696 --> 33:53.430
<i>  I think we have</i>
<i>  created the perfect recipe.</i>

33:53.432 --> 33:55.232
We're gonna put this stuff
in a can

33:55.234 --> 33:56.800
and we're gonna call it,
the ritual.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.969
That is my man, chad.

33:58.971 --> 34:02.139
So this is the ritual
being canned.

34:02.141 --> 34:05.609
Tim smith's moon chasers,
the ritual. Sweet tea
and moonshine.

34:05.611 --> 34:08.512
Starting down here, these
are those 200 milliliter cans.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.348
So we got 47,000
cans this run

34:11.350 --> 34:13.150
comin' down
through this feeder,

34:13.152 --> 34:14.751
and you'll like
this part a lot,

34:14.753 --> 34:16.386
we programmed these in

34:19.024 --> 34:20.891
with your name printed
on the bottom of that.

34:20.893 --> 34:23.293
That's what I'm talking about.
That's all right, right there.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.228
-Yeah that's kinda cool,
isn't it?
-Technology man.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.030
I know.
For the best part of it,

34:27.032 --> 34:28.432
let's go watch the stuff
goin' in the can.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.167
[tim] then it goes on down.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.337
So now they're
all getting dosed and filled.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.139
[tim] what's all that
smoke going on there?

34:36.141 --> 34:37.808
It's liquid nitrogen.

34:37.810 --> 34:38.942
Liquid nitrogen?

34:38.944 --> 34:40.343
[chad] pushes all
the oxygen out.

34:40.345 --> 34:41.445
You can it with that

34:41.447 --> 34:43.814
the can doesn't have
a long of a shelf life,

34:43.816 --> 34:45.182
the product won't last long.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.217
<i> [tim] if the air level</i>
<i>  is too high,</i>

34:47.219 --> 34:48.852
bacteria can grow in there.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.987
So if you got bacteria
growing in it,

34:50.989 --> 34:52.956
they're just gonna make it
go bad.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.224
[chad] so the finished product

34:55.327 --> 34:56.793
will look like that.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.595
[tim] yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

34:58.597 --> 35:02.099
You ready to try and see
what you think of the can,
the finished product.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.567
-Cheers to you, sir.
-[tim] all right.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.073
Oh, wow! That is nice.

35:10.075 --> 35:12.509
-Yeah.
-I can just tell, right off,
I think we nailed it.

35:12.511 --> 35:15.312
<i>  No one's ever heard of</i>
<i>  the moonshiner sweet tea,</i>

35:15.314 --> 35:16.446
and we've already
mastered that,

35:16.448 --> 35:19.082
we got the profile down,
we got it in a can.

35:19.084 --> 35:20.617
-Cheers to the ritual.
-[tim laughs]

35:20.619 --> 35:24.221
now it's gonna be available
to anyone in the public
and you can drink it.

35:24.223 --> 35:27.757
For me, these just look like
little spinning dollar signs
coming off of this.

35:27.759 --> 35:32.095
-[chad] yeah.
-But they got this weird
dude's picture on them.

35:32.097 --> 35:34.231
-I don't know what--
-that's that dude getting
all them dollar bills.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.832
[chad] ooh!

35:35.834 --> 35:38.335
[man 1] I'm getting
a high reading
on my dissolved oxygen meter.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.170
[chad] all right.
Let me see what I can do.

35:40.172 --> 35:41.771
I'm gonna go ahead
and purge it with nitrogen.

35:41.773 --> 35:42.939
[tim] just like over there,
right?

35:42.941 --> 35:46.243
-[chad] yeah.
-There's too much
oxygen in the tote.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.178
<i>  So we have</i>
<i>  this liquid nitrogen there</i>

35:48.180 --> 35:50.380
with a, a adapter
that they have made to,

35:50.382 --> 35:53.717
to put on the end of it
and they push
liquid nitrogen into it

35:53.719 --> 35:56.453
which actually pushes the air
out the top.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.357
Ahhh!
Woah! Woah!

36:00.359 --> 36:04.127
[chad] oh, there you go.
The handle's off,
the handle blew off.

36:10.068 --> 36:11.835
[tim] I know there's
a fish over there, I know.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.971
They can smell it.
I don't know they hear
you sometimes, too, I think

36:14.973 --> 36:18.241
it's like when you hit it
in the water and you throw
it in and it goes, bang!

36:18.243 --> 36:20.210
[howard]
the line's bobbing. We got
a bite, son.

36:20.212 --> 36:22.179
Sucked it underneath
that rock there.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.213
Oh!

36:23.215 --> 36:26.983
God! Damn, man.
You got me hemmed up.

36:26.985 --> 36:29.186
Hey, wait a minute,
did you see that?

36:29.188 --> 36:30.987
-Bang.
-[howard] look at that.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.355
Watch him, uh,
watch it again.

36:32.357 --> 36:36.860
Oh, she biting, she's on,
son, really? Gettin' tight?

36:36.862 --> 36:38.094
[tim] jumped under that stick,

36:38.096 --> 36:41.198
maybe under that stick.
Can you net
him for me, net him.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.399
-That's all.
-You gotta net it.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.034
-Let me show you
how it's done.
-You don't break the line.

36:44.036 --> 36:46.336
I mean, you caught
a hell of a hammer.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.905
-Stick fish.
-Now you put 'em back
in the water again.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.241
-[howard] 'cause that's what
we gotta do.
-Now I gotta catch him again.

36:51.243 --> 36:52.709
How much shine
you drink today?

36:54.012 --> 36:55.078
[chad] woah! Woah!

36:55.080 --> 36:58.114
Oh, there you go!
The handle blew off.

36:58.116 --> 36:59.849
Never seen that happen before.

36:59.851 --> 37:02.219
When everything looks like
it's going real smooth,

37:02.221 --> 37:04.454
you know, it tastes good
and looks good

37:04.456 --> 37:06.289
it's going in a can
and then bang!

37:06.291 --> 37:07.924
[chad] we can't turn it
off here,

37:07.926 --> 37:10.160
-[tim] you can't cut it off.
-[chad] the whole entire
handle blew off.

37:10.162 --> 37:11.661
I don't know what happened,
but the handle

37:11.663 --> 37:13.296
<i>  blew out of the cut off.</i>

37:13.298 --> 37:15.665
[chad] that means
there's no way
to drain this out of the tank.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.033
And then
we couldn't cut it off

37:17.035 --> 37:18.301
and we couldn't cut it on.

37:18.303 --> 37:20.904
-I've never seen
that happen before.
-[tim] wow.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.739
We got the tote full of mix

37:22.741 --> 37:23.873
and we can't
do nothing with it.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.408
-Let me see that thing.
-[chad] you got a light?

37:25.410 --> 37:27.310
[tim] it's gotta go all way
down in there.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.878
[chad] yeah, without
breaking that off.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.480
[tim] I gotta find out
where's the off.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.148
-Out here.
-All right.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.251
-[tim] I got it in now.
-[chad] you think you got it?

37:34.253 --> 37:36.720
-All right, now open it up.
-[chad] it's on.

37:36.722 --> 37:39.789
-It's on, it's on.
-[tim] all right, I fixed it,
ooh!

37:39.791 --> 37:41.258
-It's, it's good.
-[tim] well I'm

37:41.260 --> 37:43.293
not sure about
purging this tote again.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.228
Take the top off
before you do it.

37:45.230 --> 37:48.098
So we figured out the problem
and we fixed it,
and get back to roll.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.934
-[chad] gonna need
a lot of straw boys.
-[tim] yeah.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.803
Well, there goes
about $200.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.006
[chad] I hate watching
all of this
go down the drain.

37:56.008 --> 37:57.707
Yeah, that's money down
the drain.

37:57.709 --> 38:00.143
<i> [tim] but now, you know,</i>
<i>  everything looks like</i>
<i>  it's doing okay.</i>

38:00.145 --> 38:03.079
This machine is doing
36 cans a minute.

38:03.081 --> 38:05.382
<i>  Imma load up some,</i>
<i>  I'm gonna show it howard.</i>

38:05.384 --> 38:06.783
And we're gonna go
meet some people.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.318
How many can I take?

38:08.320 --> 38:10.887
I don't know,
they got your name on it.

38:10.889 --> 38:14.057
-Okay, well, here's the first
three goin' with me.
-All right.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.326
Wait, you're leaving me
on the canning line by myself?

38:17.496 --> 38:18.962
Thanks, tim.

38:25.671 --> 38:27.237
[mark 1] we made
cognac one time...

38:27.239 --> 38:29.973
We did, we just
made it out of
regular old...

38:29.975 --> 38:32.008
-Grapes.
-Grapes and muscadines.

38:32.010 --> 38:35.145
The grapes that
they used for the cognac

38:35.147 --> 38:37.881
coming from the cognac region
of France,

38:37.883 --> 38:39.049
they're are white grape.

38:39.051 --> 38:40.817
Well,
so were these scuppernongs.

38:40.819 --> 38:43.186
I can get way
more of them scuppernongs

38:43.188 --> 38:45.121
they're all over the place,
back home.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.123
Get those barrels filled up.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.291
Okay, you wanna do that?

38:48.293 --> 38:49.926
-You wanna do a...
-Hell, yeah.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.361
This could be
a big improvement

38:51.363 --> 38:54.164
to the, to the cognac
we made in the past.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.965
How do you make cognac anyway?

38:55.967 --> 38:57.467
Well, you gotta make your wine

38:57.469 --> 38:59.703
and you make it into liquor
and put it in a barrel.

38:59.705 --> 39:00.970
Gotta be a barrel.

39:00.972 --> 39:03.073
I wanna,
I wanna be in on that.

39:03.075 --> 39:05.141
So you have to
a... Age, cognac.

39:05.143 --> 39:08.244
Oh, yeah.
Now that we've got a way

39:08.246 --> 39:11.314
to see aged liquor
in the mountains

39:12.951 --> 39:14.317
I think
it's worth a try, digger.

39:14.319 --> 39:15.785
I know it's worth a try.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.987
Cognac, see,
that sounds fancy.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.522
-So that would be a...
-Yeah, that is fancy.

39:19.524 --> 39:22.459
...That'd be a good product
to hit nashville with.

39:22.461 --> 39:23.860
It'd be real good.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.929
<i> [beaz] doesn't cognac</i>
<i>  sound expensive?</i>

39:25.931 --> 39:27.964
You'd think you'd
pay more for cognac

39:27.966 --> 39:30.066
than you would for rum.

39:30.068 --> 39:33.103
-I wanna do that.
-We get all that tampered up
and blended up.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.639
There'll be some finest
selections...

39:36.641 --> 39:38.274
<i> [digger] you know,</i>
<i> I love terry beasley, you know</i>

39:38.276 --> 39:42.078
she's a great person
and this is
a great surprise for her.

39:42.080 --> 39:46.316
Would you hand me my
honey pecker out
of that there spout, please?

39:46.318 --> 39:49.018
-That's your...
-That's my graduation...

39:49.020 --> 39:50.787
-...Your graduation present.
-Yeah.

39:50.789 --> 39:51.955
Let's skedaddle outta here.

39:51.957 --> 39:54.090
<i> [beaz] let's do it.</i>
<i>  Man, I can't believe this.</i>

40:04.236 --> 40:06.503
-Hi there.
-Tim, what's up, old buddy?

40:06.505 --> 40:08.004
<i> [tim] I'm going to this</i>
<i>  mexican restaurant,</i>

40:08.006 --> 40:09.239
<i>  howard's gonna meet me there</i>

40:09.241 --> 40:11.474
and, uh, I wanna
show him the ritual.

40:11.476 --> 40:14.878
Dude, you know what?
I couldn't wait no longer,
man, you took forever.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.679
I can't wait
until he tastes it.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.782
Oh, yeah. I love that.
Lot of traffic, man.

40:18.784 --> 40:20.984
-I got your menu,
got some chips.
-[tim] yeah.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.953
-What you got here?
-Oh, that's the ritual man.

40:23.955 --> 40:27.257
<i> [howard] he's actually brought</i>
<i>  what we talked about</i>
<i>  in passing</i>

40:27.259 --> 40:29.993
and made it reality.
Holy moly, man.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.362
I'mma see if it tastes as good
as it did back in the woods.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.135
Damn, tim,
this right here is
knock your socks off, great.

40:39.137 --> 40:42.272
He's taken a sweet tea
and a moonshine blended it,

40:42.274 --> 40:45.041
it is the perfect cocktail.
It blows my mind.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.110
I can already feel it,
my earlobe's
getting warm, tim.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.344
Yeah, and that's a good sign.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.913
I let howard taste it,

40:49.915 --> 40:52.215
and
I can just tell you right off,
I think we nailed it.

40:52.217 --> 40:55.885
-Oh, look at this right here.
-[woman 1] lime frozen.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.387
Now that's what
I'm cooking with.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.027
-My god.
<i> -[tim] howard's been</i>
<i>  drinking some</i>

41:04.029 --> 41:06.129
and I'm like, okay,

41:06.131 --> 41:07.964
you know howard's
just trying to get drunk.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.332
[howard] I'm telling you
that is the bomb.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.167
-That's really good, man.
-[tim] wow.

41:11.169 --> 41:14.404
This could be the next product
that we put in a can.

41:14.406 --> 41:16.339
I mean,
this could be like a series,

41:16.341 --> 41:18.341
not just, just one can.

41:18.343 --> 41:20.977
This could be a, a,
a brand of moon chasers.

41:20.979 --> 41:24.347
I might have to investigate
this tequila world too,
mexico.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.449
[howard] man, I'mma tell you
right here,

41:26.451 --> 41:29.352
if I drink one more of these,
I'mma be on my knees.
