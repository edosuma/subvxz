01:04.334 --> 01:08.634
MAN:
Hey, Belson,
you got cab 2452!

01:08.667 --> 01:11.234
Tony, get out
of cab 2452.

01:11.267 --> 01:12.534
We need it.

01:12.567 --> 01:15.467
Harry! 8622-- Wash it!

01:15.501 --> 01:17.200
It's filthy!

01:17.234 --> 01:19.767
Hey, Tony, you get creamed

01:19.801 --> 01:21.567
in your fight last night?

01:21.601 --> 01:22.601
What's it like

01:22.634 --> 01:25.634
having a cauliflower back?

01:25.667 --> 01:27.434
I didn't get creamed.

01:27.467 --> 01:29.400
I lost on the decision.

01:29.434 --> 01:31.133
I'm impressed.

01:32.133 --> 01:35.000
The referee decided
I was bleeding too much.

01:35.033 --> 01:37.400
Hey, Alex,
want to go for breakfast?

01:37.434 --> 01:38.467
No, I can't.

01:38.501 --> 01:40.000
Hey, Alex.
Hi, Alex.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.300
Hi. Hi, guys.

01:41.334 --> 01:44.033
I'm sorry I didn't have
anything smaller than a $50

01:44.067 --> 01:45.734
but I only had $150
in the bank

01:45.767 --> 01:48.100
and I took it all out
to come to New York,

01:48.133 --> 01:49.100
and they gave me
three 50s...

01:49.133 --> 01:50.100
Yeah.
and so, you see...

01:50.133 --> 01:51.968
Look, I'm sorry I had
to bring you back here

01:52.000 --> 01:53.067
just to get change.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.200
Oh, are you kidding?

01:54.234 --> 01:56.100
This is the New York
kind of thing

01:56.133 --> 01:57.467
I've always dreamed of.

01:57.501 --> 01:59.567
Maybe you want to buy
one of our postcards.

01:59.601 --> 02:01.033
Anybody here got
change for a $50?

02:01.067 --> 02:02.033
Yeah, I got it.

02:02.067 --> 02:04.000
Hey, had a good night,
huh, Alex?

02:04.033 --> 02:05.100
Very funny.

02:05.133 --> 02:06.234
Here you go.

02:06.267 --> 02:08.467
Now, how much
was that again?

02:08.501 --> 02:09.667
$4.85.

02:09.701 --> 02:13.267
There's five, and, uh...

02:17.100 --> 02:19.868
This going to take
much longer?

02:19.901 --> 02:21.434
I'm sorry.
I want to give you a tip.

02:21.467 --> 02:22.601
It's just difficult
to figure out

02:22.634 --> 02:26.767
what 15% of $4.85 is when
somebody's looking at you.

02:26.801 --> 02:30.167
CABBIES:
73 cents!

02:37.367 --> 02:38.601
No, no pennies, thanks.

02:38.634 --> 02:40.067
No pennies.

02:42.501 --> 02:43.934
Uh, may I use the phone?

02:43.968 --> 02:45.033
I have to find
someplace to stay.

02:45.067 --> 02:45.901
Yeah, right there.

02:45.934 --> 02:46.934
Oh.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.100
Uh, do you have...?

02:49.133 --> 02:50.434
Huh? Yeah.

02:50.467 --> 02:51.868
Thank you.

02:51.901 --> 02:53.000
Hey, Alex.
Yeah.

02:53.033 --> 02:55.100
They called me back
for <i>Equus.</i>

02:55.133 --> 02:56.234
Oh, you see?

02:56.267 --> 02:57.300
I told you.

02:57.334 --> 02:58.400
Hey, what's <i>Equus?</i>

02:58.434 --> 03:00.934
Hey, don't give me
a look like that.

03:00.968 --> 03:02.567
I could ask a question.

03:02.601 --> 03:04.033
A lot of people
don't know about that.

03:04.067 --> 03:06.400
It's... a play.

03:06.434 --> 03:07.901
It's a play about a psychiatrist

03:07.934 --> 03:09.701
and a boy who worships horses.

03:09.734 --> 03:12.467
So, before I go in there,
I say straight to them:

03:12.501 --> 03:15.934
"Gentlemen, you're looking at
the man you're gonna hire."

03:15.968 --> 03:18.601
So that gets their interest
up real quick, right?

03:18.634 --> 03:19.701
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

03:19.734 --> 03:21.100
Hey, what part
are you trying for?

03:21.133 --> 03:23.434
Listen, soon as I
finish over there,

03:23.467 --> 03:24.767
I'll come over here

03:24.801 --> 03:27.133
and I'll tell you
everything, okay?

03:27.167 --> 03:29.300
Until then, have
a piece of gum.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.434
Oh, thanks.

03:30.467 --> 03:32.734
Why didn't you tell
him what part?

03:32.767 --> 03:35.067
Because, Alex,
he won't understand.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.434
Try him.

03:36.467 --> 03:37.968
But, Alex, he won't...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.167
Go ahead, try him.
Take a chance.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.667
Okay.

03:44.534 --> 03:46.667
I'm up for
the part of the horse.

03:46.701 --> 03:47.868
Yeah? Which end?

03:49.234 --> 03:51.734
Gee, this phone is terrific.

03:51.767 --> 03:53.901
Yeah? We hoped you'd like it.

03:53.934 --> 03:57.133
No, no, I mean,
this plate's broken, see?

03:57.167 --> 04:01.634
You just put your money in,
and it comes right back.

04:01.667 --> 04:04.934
You can call anywhere
for free. Look.

04:09.934 --> 04:11.267
Okay, behind me.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.334
That's right,
calm yourselves.

04:12.367 --> 04:13.767
I got here first.

04:15.434 --> 04:17.399
Hey, Alex, don't you
want to make a call?

04:17.434 --> 04:19.934
No, I don't have
anybody to call.

04:21.634 --> 04:23.067
There's got to be
somebody somewhere

04:23.100 --> 04:24.100
you want to call.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.534
No, well, no,
not now.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.133
Hello?

04:28.167 --> 04:31.968
Is this the National Theater
of London, England?

04:32.000 --> 04:36.501
Yeah. I'd like to speak
to Sir Laurence Olivier, please.

04:36.534 --> 04:40.734
Yeah, it's Bobby Wheeler
from New York City calling.

04:42.033 --> 04:44.234
No, it's not personal.

04:44.267 --> 04:46.000
I'm an actor, too.

04:46.033 --> 04:51.767
This... is the National Theater
of <i>London.</i>

04:51.801 --> 04:53.501
That is a good call.

04:53.534 --> 04:54.801
Hello?

04:54.834 --> 04:57.367
I can't believe it.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.801
I... I didn't think
I could get you on the phone.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.367
Oh, wow.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.434
Laurence Olivier's secretary.

05:06.501 --> 05:08.534
Listen, uh...

05:08.567 --> 05:11.400
Do you think that I
could talk to him, please?

05:11.434 --> 05:15.033
Oh. Well, uh...

05:15.067 --> 05:17.501
what's he doing?

05:17.534 --> 05:19.200
Oh, wow.

05:19.234 --> 05:20.567
No kidding?

05:20.601 --> 05:23.234
Taking a curtain call?

05:23.267 --> 05:25.667
Well, don't bother him.

05:25.701 --> 05:29.300
Just... just tell him
that a guy...

05:29.334 --> 05:33.701
no... that an actor...
named Bobby Wheeler

05:33.734 --> 05:36.834
just called to say... that...

05:47.734 --> 05:50.367
Yeah. Hey, hey,
thanks for listening.

05:53.534 --> 05:56.834
 <i>That</i> is
 a great phone, man.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.367
Hey, Alex, you want
to take my turn?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.767
Uh, no, thanks, Tony.

06:03.801 --> 06:04.868
You go ahead.

06:04.901 --> 06:06.367
Well, if you're sure,

06:06.400 --> 06:09.234
I think I'll make
a little one myself.

06:09.267 --> 06:13.000
Operator. Yeah, I'd like
to call Bangkok, Thailand.

06:13.033 --> 06:16.934
Yeah, when I was in Vietnam,
I went R&R in Bangkok.

06:16.968 --> 06:20.133
Met a girl
I just can't get out of my mind.

06:20.167 --> 06:21.734
Just crazy about her.

06:21.767 --> 06:23.701
Classiest lady I ever met.

06:23.734 --> 06:27.334
Yes, operator, I want
the VIP Massage Parlor.

06:29.033 --> 06:31.100
Okay, I'll deposit the money.

06:32.467 --> 06:35.534
( <i>coins clattering</i> )

06:42.834 --> 06:44.000
Excuse me?

06:44.033 --> 06:45.801
Uh, my name's
Elaine Nardo.

06:45.834 --> 06:48.067
They told me
to ask for Louie.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.234
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Louie De Palma.

06:50.267 --> 06:51.234
Oh, hi.

06:51.267 --> 06:52.267
I hope there's no trouble.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.400
If there is,
I'll be glad to help

06:54.434 --> 06:55.534
in any way I can.

06:55.567 --> 06:56.634
Oh, no, no. It's just
that they told me

06:56.667 --> 06:58.767
I'd be starting work today
as a driver.

06:58.801 --> 07:00.067
Here's my hack license.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.234
You're a cab driver?

07:01.267 --> 07:02.067
What do you mean

07:02.100 --> 07:03.801
busting my chops here

07:03.834 --> 07:05.300
making believe
you're a regular person?

07:06.334 --> 07:07.434
Go wait over there.

07:07.467 --> 07:09.267
I'll call your
name and number.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.200
Till then, keep
your mouth shut!

07:12.968 --> 07:14.033
What's wrong?

07:14.067 --> 07:16.167
Don't they feed you in there?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.801
Whoo!

07:17.834 --> 07:20.567
Whoo-whoo!

07:20.601 --> 07:22.934
Hey, witty person.

07:22.968 --> 07:24.634
Fill out this form--

07:24.667 --> 07:27.100
and I hope you fill it out

07:27.133 --> 07:30.434
better than you fill out
your pants.

07:30.467 --> 07:32.734
See, we're all fun here.

07:35.100 --> 07:37.968
Now, you mustn't be too upset
with Louie, miss.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.767
He's really a very nice guy.

07:39.801 --> 07:42.601
He'd give you
the scales off his back.

07:43.801 --> 07:45.534
Well, I don't have to worry
about him.

07:45.567 --> 07:48.033
I'm only going
to be working here part-time.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.167
Oh.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.501
I have
this other job...

07:50.534 --> 07:51.567
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know.

07:51.601 --> 07:52.734
We're all part-time here.

07:52.767 --> 07:54.000
I'm part-time.

07:54.033 --> 07:55.667
I only work
60 hours a week.

07:55.701 --> 07:57.000
No, really--
I really work

07:57.033 --> 07:58.868
as a receptionist
at an art gallery.

07:58.901 --> 07:59.901
Oh, yeah?

07:59.934 --> 08:00.434
No, I'm not really
a taxi driver.

08:00.467 --> 08:01.434
No, no, I understand.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.801
You see that guy over there?

08:02.834 --> 08:03.868
Now, he's an actor.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.367
The guy on the phone,
he's a prizefighter.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.634
This lady over here,
she's a beautician.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.734
The man behind her,
he's a writer.

08:09.767 --> 08:11.567
Me, I'm a cab driver.

08:11.601 --> 08:14.234
I'm the only cab driver
in this place.

08:14.267 --> 08:17.067
Why is everyone here
just a little angry?

08:17.100 --> 08:18.667
Hey, it's ringing.

08:18.701 --> 08:19.667
Excuse me, miss.

08:19.701 --> 08:20.667
You're a very
interesting person,

08:20.701 --> 08:21.868
but I'm not sure
you're as interesting

08:21.901 --> 08:23.901
as a massage parlor in Bangkok.

08:23.934 --> 08:26.467
Well, don't be too sure
till you know me better.

08:26.501 --> 08:27.734
Oh...

08:27.767 --> 08:28.968
No, no, I'm kidding.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.033
I'm not serious.

08:30.067 --> 08:31.200
I'm all talk, really.

08:31.234 --> 08:32.366
Please. I'm all talk.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.801
Oh, well...

08:33.833 --> 08:36.701
back to the massage parlor.

08:36.734 --> 08:40.234
Hello, this is PFC
Tony Banta.

08:40.267 --> 08:42.601
I'm calling from the USA.

08:42.634 --> 08:45.567
I'd like to speak to...
Number 12.

08:49.434 --> 08:51.167
She's not, huh?

08:51.200 --> 08:54.801
Hey, is there any way
I could reach her?

08:54.834 --> 08:56.467
Oh. Well, so long.

08:56.501 --> 09:00.667
Since the war's over,
they only go up to nine.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.167
Hey, was that
a crazy call I made?

09:04.200 --> 09:07.767
I mean, do you think number 12
ever thinks of me?

09:07.801 --> 09:09.501
How many times
you ever see her?

09:09.534 --> 09:10.701
Ten or 20 times.

09:10.734 --> 09:11.767
How long were you
in Bangkok?

09:11.801 --> 09:12.968
A day.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.400
Yeah, I think
she remembers you.

09:16.434 --> 09:17.701
Hey... hey, Alex,
this is fun.

09:17.734 --> 09:18.701
Why don't you
make a call?

09:18.734 --> 09:19.701
No...

09:19.734 --> 09:21.267
Come on.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.367
Actually, I was thinking
there for a second

09:23.400 --> 09:24.634
about calling my, uh, my kid.

09:24.667 --> 09:25.834
Hey, I didn't know
you had a kid!

09:25.868 --> 09:26.834
Oh, well...

09:26.868 --> 09:27.901
Wow! A boy or a girl?

09:27.934 --> 09:28.968
Girl.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.167
Hey, Alex, how come
you never brought her...?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.234
'Cause I haven't
seen her in 15 years.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.300
15 years?!

09:33.334 --> 09:35.033
Yeah, 15 years.

09:35.067 --> 09:37.067
My ex-husband was right.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.467
He's not the worst there is.

09:39.501 --> 09:41.767
Oh, so you made up your mind
about me already, huh?

09:41.801 --> 09:42.868
I'm a heel.

09:42.901 --> 09:44.267
I abandoned my daughter

09:44.300 --> 09:46.167
and now you're going
to shun me, huh?

09:46.200 --> 09:47.467
Well, let's put it this way:

09:47.501 --> 09:49.934
I'd rather be
on a desert island with him.

09:49.968 --> 09:52.000
Don't you wish.

09:52.033 --> 09:54.834
Now, wait a minute...
Now, wait a minute.

09:54.868 --> 09:57.133
Listen,
Miss, uh, Elaine Nardo,

09:57.167 --> 09:58.334
you know, things aren't always
as pat as they seem.

09:58.367 --> 10:01.067
Divorced mothers
taking care of their children

10:01.100 --> 10:03.834
against incredible odds,
while the men are free

10:03.868 --> 10:05.901
to stay out all night,
join a gym,

10:05.934 --> 10:08.334
and take advantage
of girls named Debbie.

10:08.367 --> 10:11.100
Now, look-- my wife,
for example.

10:11.133 --> 10:13.501
She married this gentleman
from South America.

10:13.534 --> 10:15.067
Moved there with the kid,

10:15.100 --> 10:17.033
and told me that if
I really loved my daughter,

10:17.067 --> 10:18.968
I wouldn't contact her

10:19.000 --> 10:20.634
because it would cause
too much confusion.

10:20.667 --> 10:21.968
She told me

10:22.000 --> 10:23.567
that if I really wanted
to be a good father,

10:23.601 --> 10:25.334
I would allow this gentleman...

10:25.367 --> 10:28.300
from South America...
to adopt her.

10:30.334 --> 10:31.767
Show you what a...

10:31.801 --> 10:34.167
how smart I was, I bought it.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.033
I'm sorry about
what I said before.

10:38.067 --> 10:40.100
You're not a heel.

10:40.133 --> 10:41.767
You're a jerk.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.434
I accept your apology.

10:45.467 --> 10:46.667
A giant jerk.

10:46.701 --> 10:49.133
Listen, no matter what
you agreed to before,

10:49.167 --> 10:51.968
it shouldn't stop you from
picking up that phone right now

10:52.000 --> 10:53.501
and calling
your daughter.

10:53.534 --> 10:54.734
Leave the man alone.

10:54.767 --> 10:57.067
If he doesn't give a damn
about his kid

10:57.100 --> 10:58.334
that's his business.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.200
Hey, now, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

11:00.234 --> 11:03.601
All right, I'll call her!

11:03.634 --> 11:04.834
I'll call her tomorrow

11:04.868 --> 11:06.434
when the line
isn't so long.

11:15.133 --> 11:18.000
You are going to feel
so much better,

11:18.033 --> 11:19.634
I promise you.

11:19.667 --> 11:22.167
I feel like we're getting
married at Annapolis.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.267
Yes, operator, Rio De Janeiro.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.634
Yes, I can hold.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.367
I have no idea what I'm going
to say to this kid.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.234
LOUIE:
Latka! Where
you going?!

11:36.267 --> 11:38.400
Latka, I don't want you
hanging around the drivers.

11:38.434 --> 11:39.567
I need you on
the third level

11:39.601 --> 11:40.667
to fix the cabs.

11:40.701 --> 11:44.334
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

11:46.534 --> 11:48.367
That's telling him,
Latka.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.300
Latka, no, this is
a very important phone call.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.434
It's a very bad time for
English lessons right now.

11:52.467 --> 11:53.601
Please.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.033
All right, all right.
While I'm waiting.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.367
What is it?

12:01.400 --> 12:03.567
Eh... Lesson 12.

12:03.601 --> 12:04.868
Mm.

12:04.901 --> 12:06.868
( <i>haltingly:</i> )
Thank you, chambermaid,

12:06.901 --> 12:09.901
for your
excellent service.

12:09.934 --> 12:16.501
I am glad I don't require
medical assistance.

12:16.534 --> 12:18.267
Yeah, listen,
that, uh, that's...

12:18.300 --> 12:20.400
that's very good,
that's very good

12:20.434 --> 12:23.634
but those phrases all have
"chambermaid" every other word.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.634
Why don't you take a look
at the phrases I wrote
in the back of the book?

12:25.667 --> 12:28.033
Here, look:
"Get off my back."

12:28.067 --> 12:30.634
"Give me a minute
while I go to the can."

12:30.667 --> 12:32.400
Study those.

12:32.434 --> 12:33.834
Yes, operator, I'm here.

12:33.868 --> 12:34.868
"Get off my back."

12:34.901 --> 12:37.734
Uh, Latka... later.

12:39.868 --> 12:41.567
Yes, uh, is Mrs., um--

12:41.601 --> 12:43.434
Oh, what the hell's
her name now--

12:43.467 --> 12:45.400
Consuelos there?

12:45.434 --> 12:47.400
Consuelos?

12:47.434 --> 12:51.300

12:51.334 --> 12:52.901
Yes, thank you.

I'm not sure
I know what to say to you.

Oh, yeah, that would be
a good place to start.

13:40.133 --> 13:41.801
Alex Rieger.

13:41.834 --> 13:43.300
Yeah.

13:43.334 --> 13:44.934
Uh... good.

13:44.968 --> 13:50.067
Uh, listen, Phyllis, I was just
thinking about Kathy, uh...

13:50.100 --> 13:52.501
Can I speak to her?

13:52.534 --> 13:54.601
Oh.

13:54.634 --> 13:57.901
When did she leave?

13:57.934 --> 14:00.133
Why Portugal?

14:00.167 --> 14:01.667
Well, that's no answer.

14:01.701 --> 14:04.901
Why is she going to college
in Portugal?

14:04.934 --> 14:07.934
What's her major, sardines?

14:07.968 --> 14:08.968
Hey, wait a minute!

That means she'll be coming
through New York.

Well, listen, uh...

if you speak to her,
tell her I'm...

14:18.267 --> 14:19.434
sorry I missed her.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.267
Wait a minute.

What time
will she get into Miami?

14:24.133 --> 14:29.334
If I want to meet her in Miami,
I'll meet her in Miami.

Well, what time tomorrow?

14:31.434 --> 14:33.167
Okay.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.501
Well, I don't know.

14:34.534 --> 14:35.934
I'll think about it.

14:35.968 --> 14:36.968
I might!

14:38.100 --> 14:39.200
Okay, what?

14:39.234 --> 14:41.200

Thank you.

14:42.667 --> 14:45.234
Phyllis, just hold on a second.

14:45.267 --> 14:49.534
Phyllis, did you ever
sort of think about us and...

14:49.567 --> 14:51.667
me neither.

14:51.701 --> 14:53.200
Yeah, okay, right.

So long. Good-bye.

I need a cab for the weekend.

Aw, come on, Louie.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.067

I got to leave now.

Let's take it.

15:13.834 --> 15:16.467
Okay, I got to get
tough with you guys.

We don't let cabs
out no more.

Oh, come on, Louie,
it's very important.

What about 1621?
Nobody wants 1621!
No!

Hey, hey, hey,
can I go along?
Yeah, sure.

15:27.934 --> 15:29.133
I don't have anything
else to do.

15:29.167 --> 15:30.067
I'll have it back for you
by the end of the weekend.

Alex, I run this garage,

15:31.701 --> 15:34.434
and no one takes my
cabs for joyrides.

All right.

Come on, let's take it.

some of that time.

something from 15 years ago?

Well, um... like the fact

19:34.033 --> 19:37.000
that when you were born,
the doctor had to turn you

so you could get out
the right way.

19:38.501 --> 19:39.834
Life started right there.

used to look annoyed at me

19:42.100 --> 19:43.501
when I gave you
a 2:00 a.m. feeding

19:43.534 --> 19:46.367
and I couldn't figure out
why it was you who was annoyed.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.667
You hardly crawled.

19:47.701 --> 19:49.067
You went right to walking.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.267
You used to sneeze like a cat.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.701
( <i>high-pitched sneezing</i> )

19:52.734 --> 19:55.968
I even remember your favorite
food: strained peas.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Yeah, you used to send it back
if you got chopped peas.

19:59.300 --> 20:00.701
I remember your favorite joke:

20:00.734 --> 20:02.434
Got your nose.

20:04.934 --> 20:07.601
Which is no longer
your favorite joke.

20:09.601 --> 20:12.534
Listen, Kathy...

20:12.567 --> 20:15.334
you can rap me for a lot:

20:15.367 --> 20:17.968
copping out...

20:18.033 --> 20:20.534
telling myself that I was
letting you out of my life

20:20.567 --> 20:22.734
for your good,
when the truth is

20:22.767 --> 20:26.968
I was looking  for the
easy way out myself.

20:28.701 --> 20:29.667
So, please, don't tell me

20:29.701 --> 20:31.501
that I don't remember
the experience

20:31.534 --> 20:33.367
of having a daughter
for two years.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.534
I mean, please, don't tell me
that, because I really do.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.133
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):
I remember.

20:44.467 --> 20:47.033
( <i>over P.A.</i> ):
Iberia flight 936 for Lisbon

20:47.067 --> 20:50.901
final boarding at gate 10.

20:50.934 --> 20:52.234
Hey, listen, uh...

20:52.267 --> 20:54.701
when you wear your bag
over your shoulder

20:54.734 --> 20:57.400
always wear it
with the clasp on the inside.

20:57.434 --> 20:58.634
It's safer that way.

20:58.667 --> 20:59.968
All right.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.934
And don't trust guys
who wear scarves over here.

21:01.968 --> 21:04.033
Don't trust guys
who go too far down

21:04.067 --> 21:05.167
with the buttons
on their shirt.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.501
And don't trust guys
who wear too much

21:06.534 --> 21:08.033
religious stuff
around their neck.

21:08.067 --> 21:12.234
I mean, uh,
don't trust guys.

21:12.267 --> 21:14.534
Hey, uh...

21:14.567 --> 21:16.634
Hey, listen,
in case you want to write, uh..

21:16.667 --> 21:19.167
here.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.200
Uh, here's something
with my address on it.

21:22.234 --> 21:23.334
Oh.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.434
But it's
your driver's license.

21:25.467 --> 21:26.801
Oh.

21:26.834 --> 21:28.634
Aw, go ahead.

21:28.667 --> 21:32.501
That way you can have
a picture of me, too.

21:35.734 --> 21:38.400
Well, listen, so long.

21:38.434 --> 21:40.267
I mean, it was nice
talking to you.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.567
Same here.

21:56.501 --> 21:57.834
( <i>laughs</i> )

21:59.834 --> 22:01.501
I think I have
your smile.

22:01.534 --> 22:02.834
Yeah? That's funny.

22:02.868 --> 22:05.167
I just got it
two seconds ago.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.367
Well...

22:06.400 --> 22:08.901
Listen, you better go.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.934
Hey, Alex, your daughter...

22:21.968 --> 22:23.667
she's beautiful.

22:23.701 --> 22:26.567
Yeah, well, thank you.

22:26.601 --> 22:28.968
( <i>crying</i> )

22:41.467 --> 22:45.167
( <i>all groaning</i> )

22:45.200 --> 22:47.868
Well, it was sweet
while it lasted.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.801
Hey, everybody.

22:51.834 --> 22:54.167
Guess what?

22:54.200 --> 22:55.667
I got my hack license.

22:55.701 --> 22:56.868
( <i>laughs</i> )

22:56.901 --> 22:57.868
Oh, boy.

22:57.901 --> 22:59.367
You miss Rona Barrett
one morning,

22:59.400 --> 23:00.734
you lose touch.

23:03.767 --> 23:06.234
Bobby...

23:06.267 --> 23:07.801
I didn't expect
to see you here.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.601
I thought you got
that job on <i>Equus.</i>

23:11.033 --> 23:12.901
No, uh...

23:12.934 --> 23:14.434
they went another way.

23:19.334 --> 23:22.467
Nah, it's cool, you know?

23:22.501 --> 23:24.200
No, really...

23:24.234 --> 23:26.334
it's cool.

23:27.968 --> 23:29.734
It's cool.

23:31.734 --> 23:33.133
Oh, thanks.

23:34.968 --> 23:38.234
Okay, we got a lot of cabs here.

23:38.267 --> 23:40.934
Rieger, 214.

23:40.968 --> 23:44.734
Banta, 8367.

23:44.767 --> 23:48.400
Nardo, 1532.

23:48.434 --> 23:50.601
Wheeler, 999.

23:50.634 --> 23:51.667
Not 999!

23:51.701 --> 23:53.167
Hey, Gravas!

23:53.200 --> 23:55.501
Fix the horn on 816.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.400
Hey, Burns...

23:58.434 --> 24:00.000
Bring your
license here.

24:00.033 --> 24:01.033
All right.

24:04.267 --> 24:07.234
