02:00.579 --> 02:02.522
Hya! Hya!

02:05.876 --> 02:10.651
Hya! Hya! Hya! Come on, dogie!

02:30.275 --> 02:31.501
Whoa...

02:33.403 --> 02:35.221
Texas?

02:36.531 --> 02:39.054
Chihuahua steers.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.026
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

02:48.168 --> 02:52.694
My name's Clanton. This is my
boy, Ike. My oldest boy.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.697
Any sweet water up beyond?

02:55.801 --> 02:59.246
Yeah. Two, three miles
straight up the trail.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.575
- Cattle look pretty scrawny.
- Yeah.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.899
Me and my brothers, we're
trailing them on to California.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.772
If you ain't committed to no shipper,
I'll take them off your hands.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.420
Not interested.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.714
Make you a good offer. Pay you
in silver, three dollars a head.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.720
Nope.

03:20.409 --> 03:24.230
- Might raise you to five dollars silver.
- Paid more than that in Mexico.

03:25.080 --> 03:28.229
They'll be a sorry-looking lot
when you get to California.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.061
They'll feed out when we
get to grass country.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.068
Sure is rough-looking country.

03:34.965 --> 03:38.695
Ain't no cow country. Mighty
different where I come from.

03:38.927 --> 03:42.622
- What do they call this place?
- Just over the rise, big town...

03:42.723 --> 03:47.078
- ...called Tombstone. Fine town.
- Tombstone?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.378
Yeah, I heard of it.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.023
Well, me and my brothers...

03:53.024 --> 03:57.925
might ride in there tonight. Get
ourselves a shave, glass of beer.

03:57.988 --> 04:02.138
You'd enjoy yourself. Wide awake,
wide-open town, Tombstone.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.516
- Get anything you want there.
- Thank you.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.533
James, this is mighty fine chow.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.978
One of these days you're gonna
be as good a cook as Ma.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.873
- I'm learning and trying.
- That's what I'm telling him.

04:50.874 --> 04:55.775
Corey Sue ain't marrying him because
he's pretty. Because he's a good cook.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.995
There goes that <i>chingadera</i> again.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.791
That sure is a mighty
pretty piece of brass.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.664
Brass? That's solid silver.

05:10.936 --> 05:15.837
Twenty-five American dollars' worth of
solid silver, ain't it, brother Wyatt?

05:15.899 --> 05:18.297
It sure is, James.
Don't let him fool you.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.430
Gonna look mighty pretty in
them curls of Corey Sue's.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.674
Ain't that the truth now.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.052
Let's mount up. If we're going
to town, let's get going.

05:40.590 --> 05:46.618
Twenty-five dollars gold.
By gollies, you sure got a bargain.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.125
- Whoa, girl! Whoa!
- So long, James.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.873
So long, James.

05:56.189 --> 06:01.341
So long, Wyatt. Morgan.
So long, Virgil.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.576
There it is. Tombstone.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.621
Let's go.

07:25.445 --> 07:29.800
Good evening, gentlemen. Welcome
to the Bon Ton Tonsorial Parlor.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.262
- Barbershop?
- Well, if you want to call it that.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.315
What can I do for you?

07:43.213 --> 07:45.315
- Shave.
- Hair cut?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.489
- Shave.
- We give baths too.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.745
Shave.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.170
I don't know how to work it
so good. Only had it a week.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.878
Come all the way from Chicago.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.425
- Say, you fellows miners?
- No.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.724
- Prospectors?
- We're cattlemen...

08:12.075 --> 08:16.305
just passing through here.
Shave, please.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.690
Hey!

08:25.130 --> 08:26.573
Hey, barber!

08:32.761 --> 08:35.081
What kind of a town is this?

08:36.558 --> 08:37.659
Barber!

08:55.952 --> 08:59.663
Luke, you know your duty. You and
your marshals go and get him out.

08:59.664 --> 09:04.565
That's Indian Charlie in there, drunk.
I ain't committing suicide on myself.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.754
- Me neither.
- I ain't going in there.

09:06.755 --> 09:10.780
What kind of a town is this anyway?
Excuse me, ma'am.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.911
A man can't get a shave without
getting his head blown off.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.581
You're the marshal. Get
that drunk Indian.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.475
- Why don't you?
- They ain't paying me for it.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.500
And they ain't paying
me enough either.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.591
Young man, you be careful!

09:52.008 --> 09:53.860
It's all right, ladies.

09:57.889 --> 10:01.459
I don't blame old Luke.
I wouldn't go in there either.

10:22.747 --> 10:27.398
What kind of a town is this anyway,
selling liquor to Indians?

10:29.712 --> 10:30.984
Ow.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.822
Put a knot on his head
bigger than a turkey's egg.

10:35.009 --> 10:38.488
Indian, get out of
town and stay out.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.351
How'd you like to stay
on here, as marshal?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.454
Nope. Barber!

10:46.563 --> 10:49.166
- 200 a month goes with this badge.
- Not interested.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.339
I'm just passing through trying
to get a relaxing shave.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.922
- We'll make it 250.
- Not interested.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.257
Hey, Mr. Bon Ton!

10:59.909 --> 11:02.619
- Shave, please.
- We want to thank you, Mr...?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.939
- Earp. Wyatt Earp.
- What?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.684
You're not the marshal
from Dodge City?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.523
Ex-marshal.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.703
The cattle's gone!

11:35.028 --> 11:36.630
James!

11:39.532 --> 11:40.679
James!

12:24.327 --> 12:27.120
- Mayor, is that marshaling job still open?
- It is.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.565
- I'll take it.
- It's yours.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.935
Providing my brothers
are my deputies.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.817
- When do you want to start?
- Now.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.240
- Who runs the gambling around here?
- Doc Holliday, mostly.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.620
- Who runs the cattle?
- The Clantons.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.624
Old man Clanton and his four sons.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.974
Good evening, Mr. Clanton.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.017
Good evening.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.438
The fellow with the
trail herd, remember?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.320
Oh, sure, I remember you.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.696
You was right. I didn't
get very far with them.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.194
They was rustled this evening.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.448
That so?

13:27.223 --> 13:29.667
Well, that's too bad.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.801
Guess you ain't heading
for California, huh?

13:41.821 --> 13:44.970
No. I figured on
sticking around a while.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.302
Got myself a job.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.848
- Cowpunching?
- Marshaling.

13:54.250 --> 13:58.196
Marshaling? In Tombstone?

13:59.422 --> 14:02.924
Well! Good luck to you, Mr...?

14:02.925 --> 14:06.325
Earp. Wyatt Earp.

14:37.877 --> 14:42.733
1864, 1882.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.866
Eighteen years.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.625
Didn't get much of a
chance, did you, James?

14:59.690 --> 15:05.047
I wrote to Pa and Corey Sue. They're
gonna be all busted up over it.

15:07.240 --> 15:12.722
Corey Sue's young. But Pa,
guess he'll never get over it.

15:16.958 --> 15:22.280
I'll be coming out to see you regular,
James. So will Morg and Virg.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.284
We're gonna be around
here for a while.

15:27.385 --> 15:31.012
Can't tell. Maybe when
we leave this country...

15:31.013 --> 15:36.540
young kids like you will be
able to grow up and live safe.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.202
- What'd you find?
- I followed their trail...

16:35.203 --> 16:39.524
from Clanton country to the river.
They're moving cattle, all right.

16:41.751 --> 16:45.856
Well, get yourself some sleep. There's
coffee on the stove and some beans.

16:45.963 --> 16:49.158
Morg's riding shotgun to Tucson.

16:49.592 --> 16:53.367
Say, maybe I'd better ask around
the banks while I'm down there.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.958
They're too smart for that.

17:15.326 --> 17:18.680
Chihuahua, sing us the one
about the old blind mule.

18:52.214 --> 18:56.319
Hey, Mac. I hear Doc's
coming back tonight.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.525
Well, maybe he is and maybe
he ain't. I ain't heard.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.434
Well, do you know where he's been?

19:04.435 --> 19:07.835
Tucson. Over the border.
Who knows where Doc goes?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.845
I love poker.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.311
Yes, sir, I really love poker.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.309
Every hand a different problem.

19:28.417 --> 19:31.270
I've got to do a
little figuring here.

19:33.422 --> 19:37.368
What would I do if I was in
your boots, Mr. Gambler?

19:41.764 --> 19:44.913
You drew three cards
and I stood pat...

19:45.101 --> 19:47.044
and yet you raised me.

19:50.940 --> 19:55.045
Now the question is,
what should I do?

19:59.907 --> 20:05.889
Yeah, mighty interesting game,
poker. A game of chance.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.570
Listen, miss, I admire poker,
but you're increasing the odds.

20:16.799 --> 20:21.511
- I catch you doing that again, I'll run...
- Listen, Mr. Tin Star Marshal.

20:21.512 --> 20:24.456
This is Doc Holliday's town,
and when he comes back...

20:34.984 --> 20:37.963
Sorry, but I don't like
eight-handed poker deals.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.597
- Mr. Marshal, you don't think that I...
- Oh, no.

20:42.116 --> 20:45.095
- Well, where were we?
- He just raised you, marshal.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.687
Oh, yeah.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.936
Well, seeing as you know
I got three of a kind...

20:50.666 --> 20:52.734
I guess I'll...

21:07.641 --> 21:09.960
How are you, Doc?

21:12.229 --> 21:14.548
Have a good trip?

21:15.816 --> 21:18.089
Doc Holliday.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.309
Nice-looking fella.

21:30.915 --> 21:33.438
Don't let's have trouble.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.776
I told you to get out
of town and stay out.

21:42.134 --> 21:46.831
- Oh, Doc, I'll cut you in on the game...
- I told you to get out of town.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.749
Check me in, will you?

21:59.443 --> 22:03.173
That door's for
ladies and gentlemen.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.688
Go on with your game, gentlemen.

22:29.807 --> 22:33.787
Well, you can cash me in. It's
getting late. I'll see you all later.

22:39.692 --> 22:45.845
This sure is a hard town for a fella
to have a quiet game of poker in.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.994
- Howdy.
- Good evening.

23:15.269 --> 23:18.088
- I'm...
- Wyatt Earp. I know.

23:18.647 --> 23:22.047
I know all about you and
your reason for being here.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.716
I've heard a lot
about you too, Doc.

23:25.070 --> 23:30.427
You left your mark around in
Deadwood, Denver and places.

23:31.452 --> 23:35.932
In fact, a man could almost follow your
trail going from graveyard to graveyard.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.767
There's one here too.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.479
The biggest graveyard
west of the Rockies.

23:41.879 --> 23:46.780
Marshals and I usually get along better
when we understand that right away.

23:48.177 --> 23:52.532
- Get your meaning, Doc.
- Good. Have a drink?

23:54.391 --> 23:55.959
Thanks. Believe I will.

23:56.518 --> 23:59.792
Mac, a glass of champagne
for the marshal.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.707
Make it whiskey.

24:01.857 --> 24:03.834
You're my guest, marshal.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.804
Champagne.

24:12.409 --> 24:14.227
Champagne it is, Mac.

24:29.718 --> 24:33.539
- Plan on staying here long?
- A while.

24:34.181 --> 24:37.285
Till you catch the rustlers
that killed your brother?

24:38.060 --> 24:43.007
- That's the general idea.
- What's the specific idea?

24:43.691 --> 24:45.668
I don't follow you, quite.

24:45.859 --> 24:50.009
You haven't taken it into your
head to deliver us from all evil?

24:51.240 --> 24:54.867
I hadn't thought of it quite like
that. But it ain't a bad idea.

24:54.868 --> 24:59.895
- That's what I'm getting paid for.
- Let's get down to cases, marshal.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.522
I, for instance.

25:02.626 --> 25:06.671
How would you handle me if I
took a notion to break the law?

25:06.672 --> 25:10.367
- You already have.
- For example?

25:10.759 --> 25:15.035
Running that tinhorn out of town.
That's none of your business.

25:23.439 --> 25:27.775
I see we're in opposite
camps, marshal. Draw.

25:33.073 --> 25:36.552
- Can't.
- We can take care of that easily enough.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.850
Mac!

25:41.665 --> 25:45.190
My brother Morg's gun.

26:00.350 --> 26:02.351
The big one, that's Morg.

26:02.352 --> 26:05.672
The other one, that good-looking
fellow, that's my brother Virg.

26:05.898 --> 26:09.047
- This is Doc Holliday, fellas.
- Hiya, Doc.

26:09.276 --> 26:11.925
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.597
Have a drink.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.568
Don't mind if I do, Doc.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.942
- Join us, Mac.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.953
Gentlemen.

26:41.934 --> 26:45.208
- Your health.
- Your health, Doc.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.617
Thank you.

27:16.969 --> 27:21.415
Come, my good man. Give me service,
or I'll take my patronage elsewhere.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.210
Your foot, sir.

27:30.566 --> 27:32.509
Champagne.

27:37.739 --> 27:42.686
- The actor in tonight's show.
- Shakespeare in Tombstone.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.101
Coming right up, Mr. Shakespeare.

27:45.247 --> 27:49.147
It's been a long time since
I've heard Shakespeare.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.312
How would you like
to join me tonight?

27:52.546 --> 27:54.364
Yeah, fine.

27:54.965 --> 27:57.693
See he gets to the theater
or there won't be a show.

27:57.718 --> 28:02.244
- Mac, cash in for me, will you?
- Yes, sir.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.335
Take Mr. Thorndyke
to the Bird Cage.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.646
Bird Cage? You're incarcerating
me in a bird cage, sir?

28:10.647 --> 28:14.092
- That's the name of the theater.
- The theater? The show!

28:14.234 --> 28:17.258
Good heavens, the show must go on.

28:17.321 --> 28:18.843
Lead on.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.182
Drinks on the house.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.139
May I present my
friend, Wyatt Earp.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.929
Him? A friend?

29:06.995 --> 29:09.268
- "He." Not "him."
- Well, he or him.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.831
He ain't no friend of mine.

29:10.832 --> 29:14.653
What she's trying to say,
Doc, is, we've met before.

29:14.670 --> 29:18.070
Sort of found ourselves together
in a eight-handed poker game.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.791
Ladies...

29:35.691 --> 29:37.839
and gentlemen.

29:38.527 --> 29:42.632
Owing to circumstances that
I had nothing to do with...

29:42.864 --> 29:46.810
the show <i>The Convict's Oath</i>
will not appear tonight.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.854
But as if I didn't already
have enough trouble...

29:52.916 --> 29:57.897
that eminent actor, that
sterling tragedian...

29:58.005 --> 29:59.823
Mr. Granville...

30:00.007 --> 30:02.326
Thorndyke!

30:02.843 --> 30:04.741
has completely disappeared.

30:22.571 --> 30:25.550
Wait a minute. What are
you acting so mad about?

30:25.574 --> 30:28.518
This is the fourth time
this year this happened.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.412
Bird imitators. Bird
imitators, that's all we get.

30:31.413 --> 30:34.457
- I can explain that.
- What are you fixing to do?

30:34.458 --> 30:37.626
Be reasonable. All we want to
do is ride him round town...

30:37.627 --> 30:39.946
a couple of times on the rail.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.321
Well, that sounds
reasonable enough to me.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.206
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got a better idea.

30:50.265 --> 30:53.915
Just give me 15 minutes and I
think I can find this Mr...

30:54.019 --> 30:55.496
Thorndyke!

30:55.604 --> 30:59.254
I'll bring him back here. Now sit down.
Take your seats and have another beer.

31:01.443 --> 31:04.612
Look, Yorick, can't you give
us nothing but them poems?

31:04.613 --> 31:07.057
I have a very large
repertoire, sir.

31:07.115 --> 31:11.220
Great. All right, Yorick,
go ahead. Shoot.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.745
Minstrel, pray help me.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.494
Wait. I want to hear this.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.085
Thank you.

31:44.319 --> 31:49.300
To be, or not to be,
that is the question...

31:49.658 --> 31:51.450
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind...

31:51.451 --> 31:55.146
to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

31:55.330 --> 31:58.104
or to take arms against
a sea of troubles...

31:58.542 --> 32:01.441
and by opposing, end them.

32:02.671 --> 32:06.947
To die, to sleep, no more...

32:08.051 --> 32:11.451
and by a sleep to say we
end the heartaches...

32:11.680 --> 32:15.455
and the thousand natural
shocks that flesh is heir to.

32:16.226 --> 32:19.830
'Tis a consummation
devoutly to be wished.

32:20.522 --> 32:23.592
To die, to sleep.

32:24.234 --> 32:28.259
To sleep, perchance to dream.

32:28.822 --> 32:31.300
Ay, there's the rub...

32:31.658 --> 32:33.635
for in that sleep of death...

32:33.743 --> 32:38.098
what dreams may come when we have
shuffled off this mortal coil...

32:38.206 --> 32:41.150
That's enough. That's enough.

32:44.045 --> 32:46.193
You don't know nothing
but them poems.

32:46.339 --> 32:49.864
You can't sing.
Maybe you can dance.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.994
Leave him alone.

32:54.055 --> 32:55.907
Please go on, Mr. Thorndyke.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.118
Thank you, gentlemen.

32:58.768 --> 33:00.870
Must give us pause.

33:01.438 --> 33:07.170
There's the respect that makes
calamity of so long life...

33:07.861 --> 33:11.215
for who would bear the whips
and scorns of time...

33:11.781 --> 33:13.449
the law's delay...

33:13.450 --> 33:15.518
the insolence of office...

33:15.869 --> 33:19.974
and the spurns that patient
merit of the unworthy take...

33:20.415 --> 33:27.069
when he himself might his quietus
make with a bare bodkin?

33:28.215 --> 33:34.368
Who would fardels bear, to grunt
and sweat under a weary life...

33:35.639 --> 33:37.286
Life...

33:42.687 --> 33:44.710
Please help me, sir.

33:45.482 --> 33:48.131
But that the dread of
something after death...

33:49.110 --> 33:52.885
Would you carry on? I'm afraid...

33:54.616 --> 33:56.218
It's been so long.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.350
The undiscovered country...

34:03.792 --> 34:07.863
from whose bourn no
traveler returns...

34:08.838 --> 34:10.735
puzzles the will...

34:11.132 --> 34:13.826
and makes us rather bear
those ills we have...

34:15.011 --> 34:18.239
than fly to others
that we know not of?

34:18.889 --> 34:22.915
Thus conscience does make
cowards of us all...

34:52.716 --> 34:56.070
They're waiting for you at
the theater, Mr. Thorndyke.

34:57.304 --> 34:59.122
Thank you, sir.

34:59.347 --> 35:04.795
Shakespeare was not meant for
taverns, nor for tavern louts.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.501
Yo rick stays here.

35:20.368 --> 35:24.769
My apologies, marshal. Ike and
Phin have had a little whiskey.

35:24.873 --> 35:27.374
I figured they're
just having some fun.

35:27.375 --> 35:30.775
Come on, Mr. Thorndyke,
I'll take you to the theater.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.614
Stop!

35:38.053 --> 35:39.575
Stop, Pa! Stop!

35:42.390 --> 35:45.994
- When you pull a gun, kill a man.
- Yes, Pa.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.379
Whoa! Whoa!

36:13.380 --> 36:16.700
Tombstone, folks.
All out for breakfast.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.537
How's that, Bill? How's that?

36:21.554 --> 36:24.874
Go on. Get up there. Go on. Get up.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.377
- How're you this morning, Earp?
- Fine.

36:29.229 --> 36:32.128
How are things in
Deadwood, Mr. Gambler?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.588
All right, I guess.

36:35.443 --> 36:38.672
- Brother with you?
- No.

36:41.282 --> 36:45.979
Get yourself some flapjacks. The
stage is leaving in 30 minutes.

36:46.955 --> 36:49.399
See you're on it.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.906
Thank you.

36:59.467 --> 37:02.411
- I'll prepare a room for you.
- Thank you.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.604
Can I help you, ma'am?

37:28.496 --> 37:32.271
Dad's usually here to
take care of the...

37:35.462 --> 37:38.816
- Is that your duffel up there?
- Yes.

37:45.889 --> 37:49.433
Alice, give me a stack of buckwheat
cakes with plenty of molasses...

37:49.434 --> 37:53.020
and a steak, rare. A couple hunks
of bacon if you got some...

37:53.021 --> 37:56.421
and a big pot of coffee.

38:01.112 --> 38:03.510
I'm looking for Dr. John Holliday.

38:04.032 --> 38:08.137
- You mean Doc Holliday?
- Well, I imagine so.

38:08.244 --> 38:13.145
Doc Holliday. Why, he rode out of town
about 3:00 this morning, heading south.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.143
I don't know when
he'll be back, ma'am.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.109
He'll most likely
be back suppertime.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.109
Maybe you'd like to have some
breakfast, freshen up a bit.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.319
I would like some coffee.

38:24.552 --> 38:28.247
- Have you got a room for Miss...
- Carter. Clementine Carter.

38:35.688 --> 38:37.335
Thank you.

38:42.362 --> 38:47.013
See if Josefina can't get a few buckets
of hot water so she can take a bath.

38:47.075 --> 38:48.392
Yes, marshal.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.856
That's Doc's room. You're
across the hall from him.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.857
John's room?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.960
Oh, that's John with a mustache.

39:34.747 --> 39:36.724
He is a good surgeon, isn't he?

39:39.252 --> 39:40.774
I wouldn't know, ma'am.

39:51.472 --> 39:54.917
That's a nice picture of you.

40:09.991 --> 40:12.534
All right, folks, all together now.

40:16.748 --> 40:20.167
Tombstone is grateful to you
for a wonderful performance.

40:20.168 --> 40:22.461
Mr. Mayor, I'm touched
by your tribute.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.504
- Have my card.
- Thank you very much.

40:24.505 --> 40:27.154
Sorry you're leaving.
Here's your bill.

40:27.175 --> 40:28.652
The bill.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.994
Thank you.

40:42.607 --> 40:45.802
Great souls by instinct
to each other turn...

40:45.985 --> 40:50.010
demand allegiance, and
in friendship burn.

40:51.616 --> 40:53.138
Goodnight, sweet prince.

40:58.665 --> 41:02.269
- Goodbye!
- Parting is such sweet sorrow.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.430
- Would you like a glass of beer, ma'am?
- No, thank you.

41:56.431 --> 41:58.704
I'm looking for Dr. John Holliday.

41:59.809 --> 42:02.037
- Who?
- Dr. John Holliday.

42:03.104 --> 42:07.425
Oh. Well, I'll see if I can
find him for you, ma'am.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.881
Thank you.

42:16.409 --> 42:19.262
- Go right in, ma'am.
- Thank you.

42:20.997 --> 42:23.566
Gentlemen!

42:27.587 --> 42:29.280
Hello, John.

42:30.131 --> 42:31.733
Clem!

42:34.927 --> 42:38.452
I'd like you to meet my friend.
Wyatt Earp, Miss Clementine Carter.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.416
We've met. Good evening.

42:40.433 --> 42:44.083
Howdy, ma'am. I'll
see you both later.

42:46.856 --> 42:48.629
Let's eat.

42:48.649 --> 42:51.047
What are you up to?

42:58.034 --> 43:00.353
It's wonderful to see
you again, John.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.769
You are pleased that I came?

43:06.334 --> 43:10.484
- My coming has made you unhappy.
- It was ill-advised.

43:10.588 --> 43:14.443
Any less ill-advised than
the way you left Boston?

43:15.593 --> 43:19.072
- How'd you know I was here?
- I didn't.

43:19.388 --> 43:21.741
Finding you hasn't been easy.

43:22.183 --> 43:26.629
From cow camp to cow camp.
From one mining town to another.

43:27.855 --> 43:31.710
If nothing more, you should be
flattered to have a girl chase you.

43:31.818 --> 43:35.923
- Clem, you've got to get out of here.
- But I'm not.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.508
This is no place for
your kind of person.

43:38.533 --> 43:40.806
What kind of a person am I, John?

43:41.202 --> 43:45.978
Please go back home, Clem.
Back where you belong.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.937
Forget that...

44:07.895 --> 44:13.297
- Does this happen to John frequently?
<i>- Oui, mademoiselle</i>, each time is worse.

44:18.739 --> 44:21.012
You're ill, John.

44:21.242 --> 44:25.063
- So that's the reason you left.
- That has nothing to do with it.

44:25.246 --> 44:28.520
Foolish, foolish John. As if
that would have mattered.

44:28.791 --> 44:32.111
I tell you, the condition of my
health has nothing to do with it.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.697
I don't believe you, John.

44:35.756 --> 44:37.858
Then I'll give you the truth.

44:38.551 --> 44:41.245
The man you once knew is no more.

44:41.470 --> 44:44.449
There's not a vestige
of him left. Nothing.

44:44.599 --> 44:47.623
- I'll take you back to the hotel.
- Please, John.

44:47.894 --> 44:49.962
You can't send me away like this.

44:50.188 --> 44:54.668
You can't run away from me, any more
than you can run away from yourself.

44:55.568 --> 44:58.547
Now I know why you don't care
whether you live or die.

44:58.613 --> 45:01.307
Why you've tried to
get yourself killed.

45:01.574 --> 45:05.850
I've heard all about you, John,
and you're wrong, so wrong.

45:06.329 --> 45:09.228
You've got no right
to destroy yourself.

45:09.582 --> 45:15.530
You have a world of friends back home
who love you, John. And I love you.

45:17.298 --> 45:20.743
There's a stage leaving in
the morning for the East.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.953
Take it.

45:23.638 --> 45:25.832
If you don't, I'm moving on.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.646
Very well, John. I'll go.

46:29.537 --> 46:31.856
Dr. John Holliday!

46:40.715 --> 46:43.550
From where I stand, that
tin badge you wear...

46:43.551 --> 46:47.155
doesn't give you the right to stick
your nose in my personal affairs.

46:47.388 --> 46:49.161
What's eating you, Doc?

46:49.390 --> 46:51.367
Why didn't you tell me
Miss Carter was here?

46:51.642 --> 46:54.871
She told you why. She
wanted to surprise you.

47:07.783 --> 47:09.931
Give me a clean glass, Mac.

47:09.952 --> 47:14.182
- Don't start drinking whiskey again.
- Give me a glass, Mac.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.359
I'll pour it.

47:20.546 --> 47:22.193
Doc.

47:24.884 --> 47:27.612
That stuff'll kill you.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.679
Why don't you go away?

48:11.680 --> 48:16.976
Squall your stupid little
songs and leave me alone.

48:53.222 --> 48:56.576
- I'll see if I can get Doc to bed.
- Finish your supper.

49:00.813 --> 49:03.541
- Have a drink.
- No, thanks, Doc.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.252
I said, have a drink.

49:06.318 --> 49:08.921
No, thanks, I just finished supper.

49:09.155 --> 49:14.307
Look, Doc, I ain't trying to poke
my nose into your personal affairs.

49:15.494 --> 49:18.564
But from where I stand...

49:18.873 --> 49:23.319
a man would have to go a long ways to
find a finer girl than Miss Carter.

49:23.752 --> 49:26.981
Or a prettier one, for that matter.

49:27.381 --> 49:30.383
Ain't no man around who
wouldn't give his shirt to...

49:30.384 --> 49:32.282
Marshal.

49:32.344 --> 49:34.321
You've said enough.

49:34.722 --> 49:37.746
Just as you say, Doc.

49:42.855 --> 49:46.334
And this isn't any of
your business, either.

49:53.741 --> 49:57.516
Keep that up, and you'll
be out of business.

50:00.247 --> 50:03.897
You've just given me a
brilliant idea, marshal.

50:04.251 --> 50:07.730
It's time I tempted fate.

50:08.589 --> 50:10.612
Let's see...

50:11.425 --> 50:14.199
Who's in here I don't
particularly like?

50:15.763 --> 50:18.491
That's a sucker game, Doc.

50:19.475 --> 50:23.353
There's probably 50 fellas in town
waiting to see you get liquored up...

50:23.354 --> 50:25.673
so they can fill you full of holes.

50:25.773 --> 50:28.376
Build themselves up
a great reputation.

50:29.276 --> 50:32.596
The man that killed Doc Holliday.

50:43.249 --> 50:46.543
Mac, give me a hand and
let's get him to bed.

50:46.544 --> 50:48.191
All right.

51:20.202 --> 51:22.771
- You don't think that's kind of...
- No, sir! No, sir!

51:38.345 --> 51:42.166
New chair gets in next week
from Kansas City, Kansas.

51:42.391 --> 51:44.414
Fine. Fine.

51:48.314 --> 51:52.089
Sweet-smelling stuff, Mr. Earp.
Sweet-smelling stuff.

52:46.413 --> 52:48.039
Have a good breakfast?

52:48.040 --> 52:52.691
Yeah, stowed away a whole skillet
full of ham and eggs. Feel good.

52:55.255 --> 53:01.033
We figured on getting a buckboard
and maybe going up to see James.

53:02.096 --> 53:04.073
Good idea.

53:04.640 --> 53:08.415
Thinking I might ride out there
later this afternoon myself.

53:20.989 --> 53:25.890
If I wasn't in the territory, I'd swear
we were back home on a Sunday morning.

53:27.621 --> 53:31.100
Yeah, with Ma scrubbing our
necks to go to camp meeting.

53:31.250 --> 53:34.274
By golly, I'll bet that's
what it is. A camp meeting.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.397
Could be.

53:38.465 --> 53:42.741
You know, I swear I can almost
smell the honeysuckle blossoms.

53:43.011 --> 53:45.113
That's me.

53:46.181 --> 53:48.079
Barber.

53:52.020 --> 53:53.771
- Morning.
- Morning.

53:53.772 --> 53:56.842
You gentlemen coming to
church this morning, I hope.

53:57.151 --> 54:01.097
We're having our first social to
raise money to finish the church.

54:01.113 --> 54:02.780
See? It's a camp meeting.

54:02.781 --> 54:06.306
Camp meeting! No such dad-blasted
thing! Regular church.

54:06.493 --> 54:08.311
Is that it?

54:08.495 --> 54:12.975
- I wondered what that lumber was for.
- Roof'll be on next week.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.878
I hope you single men will come.
Be awful nice for the dancing.

54:16.879 --> 54:19.858
Yeah, sis here's single.

54:22.426 --> 54:24.369
Dad-blasted good dancer too.

54:25.053 --> 54:29.098
Thank you, ma'am, but my brothers
got sort of a job of work to do...

54:29.099 --> 54:32.294
and I ought to stay
around the place.

54:32.436 --> 54:36.564
Keeping the peace is no whit less
important. Get going, sis. Good day.

54:36.565 --> 54:39.839
- Good day.
- Good day.

54:40.861 --> 54:44.306
There's probably a lot of nice
people here. We just ain't met them.

54:44.448 --> 54:48.519
Come on, Morg, let's get started.
I'd like to get back for that dancing.

54:58.420 --> 55:01.422
As for you, when Doc finds out
you butted him last night...

55:01.423 --> 55:04.823
he'll twist that tin
badge around your heart.

55:40.504 --> 55:42.948
I'm Chihuahua.

55:43.757 --> 55:46.235
I'm Doc Holliday's girl.

55:47.761 --> 55:50.614
Just wanted to make
sure you were packing.

56:00.440 --> 56:05.027
Stop slamming doors! People bellowing,
dropping pitchers on the floor...

56:05.028 --> 56:09.178
- I get no rest.
- I'm sorry. You're not mad, are you?

56:09.366 --> 56:13.562
Sure not. What right have I got to
be mad with anyone or anything?

56:15.247 --> 56:19.147
She's packing, Doc.
She's leaving town.

56:20.168 --> 56:22.020
Happy. aren't you?

56:24.464 --> 56:26.066
I ain't sad.

56:26.842 --> 56:28.660
Get me a thing of...

56:58.165 --> 57:03.336
Chihuahua, I'm going into
Mexico for a week or 10 days.

57:03.337 --> 57:06.316
- While I'm gone, I want you...
- Take me with you, will you?

57:06.757 --> 57:08.530
Why not?

57:13.513 --> 57:15.240
Why not?

57:16.808 --> 57:21.163
Tell François to fix a bridal
breakfast. Flowers, champagne.

57:22.022 --> 57:24.216
You get in your prettiest dress.

57:24.650 --> 57:28.971
Tell him the queen is dead.
Long live the queen.

57:32.074 --> 57:34.427
Oh, Doc!

58:24.751 --> 58:27.775
- Morning, Miss Carter.
- Good morning, Mr. Earp.

58:28.088 --> 58:30.236
You leaving?

58:30.257 --> 58:33.076
Yes, I'm leaving for
the East on the stage.

58:33.552 --> 58:37.657
The eastbound stage don't
leave till noon on Sunday.

58:39.182 --> 58:41.726
It's a mighty short visit.

58:41.727 --> 58:44.376
Some people think I've
overstayed my visit already.

58:46.314 --> 58:48.132
I don't know, ma'am.

58:48.650 --> 58:52.550
But if you ask me, I think
you're giving up too easy.

58:53.905 --> 58:56.599
Marshal, if you ask me...

58:56.783 --> 58:59.602
I don't think you know much
about a woman's pride.

58:59.828 --> 59:03.558
No, ma'am, maybe I don't.

59:06.877 --> 59:10.151
Girls, don't forget to be back
in time for Sunday dinner, now.

59:10.589 --> 59:14.068
I'm sorry about your bags.
I didn't get them down.

59:14.134 --> 59:17.909
- The girls put together a lunch.
- Well, bless my soul. He did it.

59:17.971 --> 59:20.039
Good morning, miss. Marshal.

59:20.140 --> 59:25.337
John Simpson said he'd have a church
and he has. Church bells in Tombstone.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.980
I believe that's the first church
bell I've heard in months.

59:27.981 --> 59:30.175
Yes.

59:32.903 --> 59:34.676
Well...

59:48.085 --> 59:51.735
I love your town in
the morning, marshal.

59:51.797 --> 59:55.367
The air is so clean and clear.

59:58.011 --> 01:00:01.285
The scent of the desert flowers.

01:00:01.389 --> 01:00:03.207
That's me.

01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:06.852
- Barber.
- Oh.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:12.502
Marshal, may I go with you?

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:17.302
You are going to the
services, aren't you?

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:21.301
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:25.538
- I'd admire to take you.
- Thank you.

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:38.194
Now, folks, I hereby declare the
first church of Tombstone...

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:41.280
which ain't got no name yet,
nor no preacher either...

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:43.600
officially dedicated.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:46.436
Now I don't pretend
to be no preacher...

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:49.898
but I've read the Good Book from
cover to cover and back again...

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:53.068
and I nary found one
word against dancing.

01:01:53.335 --> 01:01:57.504
So we'll commence by having
a dad-blasted good dance.

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:31.040
- Will you oblige me, ma'am?
- Thank you.

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:50.681
Hold it, folks.
Dag-blast it, hold it!

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:56.267
Sashay back and make room for our
new marshal and his lady fair.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:33.683
Well, by gollies!

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.127
Marshal, I hope you're as
good a dad-blasted carver...

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:45.778
as you are a dad-blasted
good dancer.

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:48.489
Oh, you know...

01:04:58.728 --> 01:05:01.980
Pardon me for intruding on
your dinner party, marshal.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.958
That's all right. Sit and join us.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:07.797
Clem, I told you last night to
leave Tombstone and go back East.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.508
I also told you if you
didn't leave, I would.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:13.096
He)', Doc!

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:20.916
That's the second
time in three days...

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.395
you've been trying to run
somebody out of town.

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:26.155
That's my business.
That's what I'm paid for.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:30.945
Miss Carter or any other decent citizen
can stay here as long as they want to.

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:36.014
We're through talking. My advice to
you is, start carrying your gun.

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:38.117
That's good advice.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:38.936
Doc's gone.

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:45.690
He's left town. He was going to
Mexico and take me with him.

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:51.070
He was gonna marry me.
Well, you're leaving too!

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:04.811
- What's the matter?
- It's just a common case of hysteria.

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:06.380
Oh, it is, is it?

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.565
- What're you doing?
- None of your business.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:12.796
- Behave yourself. Get out.
- I won't get out till she leaves town.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.323
Do you want me to spank you?

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:18.283
Take your hands off me.
Leave me alone!

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:21.479
What do you know? What do
you know about Doc and me?

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:25.063
We was going to Mexico to get married.
Yes, he was gonna marry me.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:28.395
Until this Miss Milkface comes
pussyfooting along and...

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:31.193
Where'd you get that?

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:34.451
- Doc. Where do you think I got it?
- You ain't lying?

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:38.330
Why should I lie? He gives me everything
I've got. I've got a roomful of stuff.

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:40.998
Keep your door locked, Miss Carter.

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:44.476
See that this wildcat stays in
her room and tell Virg to stay.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:46.250
What's up?

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:49.340
Doc Holliday.

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:56.590
- Where's Holliday?
- He came in about a half-hour ago.

01:07:56.698 --> 01:08:01.349
Got his saddlebag and a sack of gold
out of the safe and left in a hurry.

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:16.447
- Were you looking for Doc?
- I am.

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:19.279
Well, he left on the bullion
stage, riding shotgun.

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:22.160
- Left town?
- For Tucson.

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:26.752
Get my bay mare up to the
jail, will you, Jess?

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.375
Sure.

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:35.135
You! Whiskey for my boys.

01:08:50.627 --> 01:08:55.698
I think the Huachuca Pass is
your best bet, Wyatt. Good luck.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:08:59.736
Thank you, Jess.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:44.763
How long ago did the
stage come through?

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.390
- About 15, 20 minutes.
- Doc Holliday on it?

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:50.102
Yes, and he was sure going to town.

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.296
I need fresh horses.
Cut me out two, Joe.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:55.796
- One that'll lead well.
- All right, marshal.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.519
That bay looks good.

01:10:24.595 --> 01:10:27.073
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:34.251
Hey!

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:50.494
Pull up!

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.998
Whoa, whoa! Easy. Whoa!

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:13.722
I told you I'm through
talking, marshal.

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:16.482
You're coming back to
Tombstone with me, Doc.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:20.103
Sorry, I'm not going back.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:22.689
Well, in that case, I'll
be taking you back.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:26.071
Go for your gun, marshal.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:27.948
You call it, Doc.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:47.805
- Who is it?
- The marshal.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.782
Why don't you go chase
yourself up an alley?

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.534
Who do you think you are?

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:57.607
- Chihuahua, open this door.
- Doc? Is that you, Doc?

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:02.024
- I said, open this door.
- Yeah, Doc. Just a minute.

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:04.981
Chihuahua!

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:08.341
- Yes, Doc.
- Open this door before I kick it down!

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:10.468
Yeah, Doc, let me get something on.

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.663
Well, hurry up!

01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:17.785
Chihuahua!

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.372
Come in, Doc.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:27.049
Chihuahua, why did you tell the
marshal I gave you this jewelry?

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.655
Well, you did, Doc.
You gave it to me.

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:33.805
I never saw this piece of junk in
my whole life. Who gave it to you?

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.828
You can't remember
everything you give me.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:40.024
- Sure you did. Don't you remember?
- When?

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:43.418
Two or three days ago. I don't know.
What difference does it make?

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:48.116
That being the case, I charge you with
the murder of my brother, James Earp.

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.866
- He's fooling.
- I ain't fooling.

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:56.742
It was stolen from him the
night he was shot in the back.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:03.957
Now do you still insist
I gave it to you?

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:06.880
- No, no, of course not.
- Then who did?

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:12.007
- I ain't gonna be a squealer, Doc.
- Let's go, Doc.

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:35.781
Well, you told me to go away and squall
my silly little songs somewhere else.

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:41.161
So I came up here
and had a good cry.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:45.423
There was a knock
at the door and...

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:49.255
I thought it was you.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:54.048
I opened the door and...

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:00.328
it was Billy Clanton.

01:15:20.725 --> 01:15:22.998
Billy Clanton! Go get him, Virg.

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:42.723
- What's happened?
- There's been a shooting. Stay outside.

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.226
Quiet!

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:50.187
She's badly hurt.

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:53.445
Mayor, you'd better send to
Huachuca for an army doctor.

01:15:53.799 --> 01:15:58.200
- We have to operate immediately.
- That'll take five or six hours, Doc.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.285
You're a doctor, ain't you?

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:01.699
Doctor!

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:15.195
Morg, go get Miss
Carter. She's a nurse.

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:17.890
Tell her to stop by Doc's
and get the doctor's bag.

01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:20.492
Mac! You and Buck go
clean the saloon.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:22.827
Put two poker tables together
and put lights around them.

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:24.475
Sure.

01:16:26.999 --> 01:16:29.022
Doc, you're gonna operate.

01:16:35.966 --> 01:16:40.071
- Drop her feet, Kirby. Drop her feet.
- Hurry, Doc.

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.230
Mac, the light. Over here.

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:56.637
Doc's here, honey. Oh,
she's been right brave.

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:08.682
Sorry, Doc.

01:17:12.419 --> 01:17:13.520
Still mad?

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:15.815
No, honey.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:20.949
Look. I haven't got anything
to put you to sleep...

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.705
so this is going to
hurt like blazes.

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:28.456
Yell, scream, holler.
Anything you like.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:30.625
Tell me when you're ready.

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:42.717
Bite on it. Bite hard.

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:58.525
Oh. Oh, Ma!

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:02.491
There, there, honey,
Doc's going to help you.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:34.602
I'm looking for your
brother, Billy Clanton.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.832
He's right in there, Mr. Earp.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:52.722
My boy Billy.

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:55.975
Shot down on the
streets of Tombstone.

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:59.399
Murdered.

01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:03.991
It's too bad it had to end
this way, Mr. Clanton.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.670
Get mounted.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:56.285
Hi, Doc.

01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:58.792
You're all right.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:01.874
You've been a brave girl.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:09.632
All right, lift her
up gently please.

01:21:13.410 --> 01:21:16.354
Doc... I mean, doctor,

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:20.272
I'm gonna take her to my house
and take good care of her.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:23.503
Can't I do that, marshal?

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:25.572
Sure.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.571
Dr. Holliday.

01:21:50.572 --> 01:21:52.265
Thanks.

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:16.448
I'm awfully proud of you, John.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.915
Thanks, Clem. She was a brave girl.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:39.021
Mac, you ever been in love?

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:43.526
No, I've been a
bartender all my life.

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:14.431
We'll be waiting for you,
marshal, at the O.K. Corral.

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:41.537
Marshal!

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:55.972
Well, the Clantons are at
the O.K. Corral all right.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:58.099
They're barricaded down there.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.644
We want you to count us in on this.

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:03.601
We ain't fighting men, but we
sure like to help you out.

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:08.102
Thanks, deacon, but this is
strictly a family affair.

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:19.614
What's the matter? They
too yellow to come fight?

01:24:19.638 --> 01:24:22.287
They'll come.

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:28.501
Easy on that keg, son.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.603
How's Chihuahua?

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:47.604
She's dead.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:54.906
"Doctor" John Holliday!

01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.493
When do we start?

01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:08.461
Sunup.

01:25:27.623 --> 01:25:31.398
Sun up, Ike! Phin! Sam!

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:52.331
Sun's coming up, marshal.

01:26:24.805 --> 01:26:27.408
- Now, got everything straight?
- Yeah.

01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:47.477
Let's go.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:28.514
Here they come!

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:54.123
Doc Holliday's with them.

01:29:01.586 --> 01:29:04.030
Wait till they get
closer, you fools.

01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:19.856
Phin, cover your brother.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:11.737
Morning, Mr. Clanton.

01:31:21.434 --> 01:31:24.208
- Let's talk a while.
- Ike!

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:29.084
Well, now.

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:31.135
You go right ahead and talk.

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:34.343
I got a warrant here
for you and your sons.

01:31:34.781 --> 01:31:37.885
Charging the murder of
James and Virgil Earp.

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:41.850
There's also a charge
of cattle-rustling.

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:45.726
I'm giving you a chance to
submit to proper authority.

01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:49.396
Well, you come on right in here,
marshal, and serve your warrant.

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:52.699
Which one of you killed James?

01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:56.695
I did. And the other one too.

01:32:04.269 --> 01:32:05.791
Then I'm gonna kill you.

01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:06.356
Throw your gun down and
come on out, old man.

01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:16.442
My boys. Ike. Sam. Phin. Billy!

01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:20.287
They're dead.
I ain't gonna kill you.

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:23.453
I hope you live a hundred years.

01:33:23.807 --> 01:33:26.911
Feel just a little what
my pa's gonna feel.

01:33:27.477 --> 01:33:30.922
Now get out of town.
Start wandering.

01:34:04.556 --> 01:34:05.657
Wyatt.

01:34:08.393 --> 01:34:11.087
- Doc?
- Yeah.

01:34:53.313 --> 01:34:56.481
Goodbye, ma'am. Mighty nice to
have made your acquaintance.

01:34:56.482 --> 01:34:58.380
Get along, horses.

01:35:15.793 --> 01:35:18.737
There's so many things
I wanted to say and...

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:22.484
now nothing seems appropriate.

01:35:23.343 --> 01:35:25.537
Yes, ma'am, I...

01:35:25.929 --> 01:35:27.906
Yeah, I know.

01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:31.683
The mayor says you might
be staying here a while.

01:35:31.684 --> 01:35:33.894
Maybe helping get a school started.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:36.464
Yes, I'm the new schoolmarm.

01:35:36.481 --> 01:35:38.959
Well, that's mighty nice, ma'am.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:43.422
Me and Morg are going out to
see Pa. Tell him what happened.

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:48.935
I might come East again.
Get some cattle.

01:35:49.494 --> 01:35:51.596
Maybe stop by here again.

01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:53.306
Stop by the schoolhouse?

01:35:53.957 --> 01:35:56.810
Yes, ma'am, I sure will.

01:36:05.718 --> 01:36:08.822
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Goodbye.

01:36:19.065 --> 01:36:22.635
Ma'am, I sure like that name.

01:36:23.152 --> 01:36:25.175
Clementine.
