WEBVTT

00:10.427 --> 00:12.220
The destruction of our command ship

00:12.304 --> 00:14.097
has severely limited our ability

00:14.181 --> 00:15.932
to fight the Empire in this sector.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.350
So maybe we don't fight.

00:17.434 --> 00:20.269
Commander Sato, sir.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.896
When things got tough for me
on Lothal,

00:21.980 --> 00:23.523
I'd go find some place to hide.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.609
You are never shy
with your opinions, Ezra Bridger,

00:26.902 --> 00:29.278
but establishing a base is a good idea.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.739
Problem is, none of the
potential bases we know of

00:31.824 --> 00:33.324
have the tactical advantage we need

00:33.409 --> 00:35.201
to protect what's left of our fleet.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.786
Or aid the nearby systems

00:36.870 --> 00:38.538
suffering from Imperial oppression.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.708
We can't help others
if we can't help ourselves, Kanan.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.418
lf only we had more allies.

00:43.502 --> 00:46.879
I know someone
who might be able to help us.

00:46.964 --> 00:49.173
A great military commander

00:49.258 --> 00:51.509
with a vast knowledge of the Outer Rim.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.845
He could assist us in finding a base,

00:53.929 --> 00:55.638
and his experienced leadership

00:55.723 --> 00:57.432
would make him a powerful ally.

00:57.516 --> 01:00.393
How do we recruit this leader?

01:00.477 --> 01:01.644
That's the problem.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.730
I lost track of him a long time ago,

01:03.814 --> 01:06.107
and all my transmissions
have gone unanswered.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.942
We can find him. Let us try.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.736
Well, there is one option

01:09.820 --> 01:11.070
I've not yet attempted.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.586
ls that the head of an old tactical droid?

01:26.670 --> 01:30.590
These droids were great
at finding things, calculating.

01:30.674 --> 01:32.341
Found my master and I a few times

01:32.426 --> 01:33.676
when we didn't want to be found.

01:33.761 --> 01:37.513
How in all the galaxy
is that droid gonna find your friend?

01:38.766 --> 01:42.018
Well, I heard he was last seen
in the Seelos system.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.936
You can start there.

01:44.021 --> 01:45.396
You're not coming with us?

01:45.481 --> 01:47.148
I have something else to attend to.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.025
The Sith Lord.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.443
There are questions,

01:50.527 --> 01:52.445
questions that need answering.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.030
I wish we could go with you.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.532
You have your own mission, Ezra.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.868
And, Kanan, if you find my friend,

01:58.952 --> 02:01.162
you must trust him.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.830
lf he's all the things you say,

02:02.915 --> 02:04.373
we can't afford not to.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.875
Trust him.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.128
What was that about?

02:09.213 --> 02:11.214
I have no idea.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.529
We get all the way to Seelos,
and now you tell me

02:34.613 --> 02:36.823
the hyperdrive wasn't completely fixed?

02:38.408 --> 02:40.034
You finished the important repairs?

02:40.118 --> 02:42.411
How did you define "important"?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.663
What's going on?

02:43.747 --> 02:45.248
Chopper and I are staying here.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.250
To clean up his mess.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.502
Take the Phantom.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.004
Hopefully we'll be ready to go
by the time you get back.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.984
Well, let's fire this thing up.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.407
I think it's scanning
for a signal of some kind.

03:19.491 --> 03:22.451
Good luck. You could really
get lost out here.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.161
Maybe that was the idea.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.955
What if this great commander
we're looking for

03:26.039 --> 03:27.623
doesn't want to be found?

03:30.627 --> 03:33.713
7-5-6-7. 7-5-6-7.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.339
It's homing in on something.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.924
7-5-6-7.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.597
There. Up ahead.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.473
7-5-6-7.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.775
Now that is a work of art.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.069
Looks like an old Republic tank,

03:57.821 --> 03:59.780
used during the Clone Wars.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.490
7-5-6-7.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.086
Ezra, be on guard.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.943
It's just a bunch of old geezers.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.819
Well-armed old geezers.

04:38.904 --> 04:41.656
-What do you want?
-We're looking for someone.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.032
Well, that's too bad,

04:43.116 --> 04:44.533
'cause there's nobody out here.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.955
Hey, does the number 7-5-6-7
mean anything to you?

04:49.039 --> 04:50.748
What did you just say?

04:51.959 --> 04:54.126
I said 7-5-6-7.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.128
I haven't heard those digits in...

04:56.713 --> 04:58.297
Well, that's my birth number.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.632
Birth number?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.384
They're clones.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.927
Kanan, wait. Stop!

05:03.387 --> 05:05.054
Jedi. They've come for revenge.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.683
Drop the blaster, old man.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.977
Don't try it, boyo! I'll gun you down.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.770
Stand down, troopers. Now!

05:13.063 --> 05:14.480
That's an order, soldier.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.565
But he's a Jedi. A Jedi!

05:16.650 --> 05:19.860
I know. I know. But they weren't
the ones that betrayed us.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.488
Remember? Wolffe, remember?

05:23.949 --> 05:26.242
Kanan, Ahsoka said to trust them.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.496
Sorry about the weapons malfunction.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.375
My friend here is just a little defensive.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.253
See, we haven't seen a Jedi since...

05:38.338 --> 05:40.631
Well, it's been a while.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.178
Well, my name's Ezra. This is Kanan.

05:46.263 --> 05:47.805
That's Sabine and Zeb.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.017
It's nice to meet you, 7-5-6-7.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.810
Actually my name is Rex.

05:52.894 --> 05:56.105
Captain, 501st Clone Battalion.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.232
Meet Commanders Gregor and Wolffe.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.109
We were sent by Ahsoka Tano.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.361
Ahsoka Tano.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.198
I fought by her side
from the Battle of Christophsis

06:06.283 --> 06:07.700
to the siege of Mandalore.

06:07.784 --> 06:10.870
And a friend of hers is a friend of mine.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.792
Hey. You're a big one, aren't you?

06:17.127 --> 06:18.252
Bigger than you.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.173
Hey, hey. Easy with those, son.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.884
Yeah, yeah. I might move the dust.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.264
How is Commander Tano?

06:30.348 --> 06:32.808
Well, in need of help.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.060
We all are.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.603
Look, we're trying to fight the Empire,

06:35.687 --> 06:38.939
but we're outnumbered,
overmatched and taking a beating.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.191
We could use your help.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.901
Well, I'm not sure

06:41.985 --> 06:43.694
I'm much help to anyone these days.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.781
Didn't you hear?

06:46.865 --> 06:48.199
The Emperor said the clone army

06:48.283 --> 06:50.785
has out served its purpose
and retired us.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.329
Now we spend our days
just telling stories

06:53.413 --> 06:54.914
and slinging for joopas.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.665
This was a wasted trip.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.709
You heard the clone.
He's not interested.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.836
Wait. You don't like the Empire,
do you?

07:01.296 --> 07:04.590
Well, the Empire certainly
isn't the Republic,

07:04.674 --> 07:06.300
but you can't do anything about that.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.677
-You could fight.
-Sorry, son.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.472
My days as a soldier are over.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.557
Well, okay. Okay, then maybe

07:13.642 --> 07:15.559
there's one thing you can help us with.

07:15.644 --> 07:16.936
We need a base.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.020
Ahsoka said you knew about

07:18.105 --> 07:20.189
all sorts of secret locations
in the Outer Rim.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.405
Well, my memory isn't
what it once was, but,

07:28.490 --> 07:32.118
there are a few spots
I never bothered to report to the Empire.

07:32.202 --> 07:34.120
Look, why don't you just wait outside

07:34.204 --> 07:36.372
and I'll put together
a list of coordinates.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.750
Listen, they are in some kind of trouble.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.795
lf we help them, we are
putting ourselves in danger.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.630
Wolffe, relax.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.382
We got the situation under control.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.675
Really? Really? What do you think

07:47.759 --> 07:49.301
the Empire will do to us

07:49.386 --> 07:51.554
if they find out that
we are helping a Jedi?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.389
Yeah, I don't know
what the Empire would do,

07:53.473 --> 07:55.558
but I'm going slinging.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.646
You know, I was thinking,

08:00.730 --> 08:04.900
since we're providing you
with a list of bases,

08:05.026 --> 08:08.487
there's something
you can do to help us.

08:08.572 --> 08:11.323
-No, thanks.
-Sure. What can we do?

08:11.408 --> 08:14.160
Out there, deep below,

08:14.244 --> 08:16.495
roam the joopa.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.290
Elusive big game.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.919
When we're lucky enough
to sling one in,

08:24.004 --> 08:26.505
it'll feed us for the whole year.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.090
Okay. What do you need?

08:29.551 --> 08:30.593
Him.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.261
What?

08:43.356 --> 08:45.357
Commander, we've received
a binary transmission

08:45.442 --> 08:47.484
from an old clone unit on Seelos.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.196
-Something about a Jedi.
-That system is remote.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.698
Haven't all the clones
been decommissioned?

08:52.782 --> 08:55.159
Yes, and while
the clone's number checks out,

08:55.243 --> 08:57.494
he has a record of calls
of delusional distress.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.288
I wouldn't take him too seriously.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.373
Send a probe to investigate.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.959
All leads must be pursued.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.188
Okay. You don't trust these clones,

09:24.272 --> 09:26.273
but they haven't done anything.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.483
You don't understand.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.776
They're dangerous.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.111
-They could...
-They could what?

09:31.196 --> 09:32.738
Rex doesn't seem bad at all.

09:32.822 --> 09:34.281
Ahsoka said to trust him.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.866
You trust her, don't you?

09:35.951 --> 09:37.159
You weren't there.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.869
You weren't even born.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.246
What are you talking about?

09:40.330 --> 09:42.206
I don't feel like discussing it.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.589
It was at the end, the end of the war.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.342
Our fellow soldiers, the clones,

09:53.426 --> 09:56.387
the ones we Jedi
fought side by side with,

09:56.471 --> 09:58.681
suddenly turned and betrayed us.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.684
I watched them kill my master.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.560
She fought beside them for years,

10:03.645 --> 10:05.938
and they gunned her down in a second,

10:06.856 --> 10:08.107
and then came for me.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.192
Later they said they had
chips in their heads

10:10.277 --> 10:11.610
that made them do it.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.195
Said they had no choice.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.114
I didn't betray my Jedi.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.991
Wolffe, Gregor and I

10:17.075 --> 10:19.159
all removed our control chips.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.080
We all have a choice.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.923
Well, for what it's worth,
I believe we can trust Rex.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.417
lf we're lucky,
we'll catch Big Bongo today.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.003
Let's get this over with.
I'm getting hungry.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.629
Keep on going forward.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.173
Just a little bit more.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.675
We're coming up on a hot spot!

11:16.760 --> 11:18.844
Your hot spot looks like
everywhere else

11:18.928 --> 11:20.471
on this desolate rock.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.058
Out there.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.185
All right, full stop.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.200
All right. Just a little bit more.

11:42.577 --> 11:43.744
Little more.

11:43.828 --> 11:44.828
Oh, really?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.623
You know, we really appreciate this.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.709
I mean, we should do well today,
with your friend here.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.753
Yeah, well, Zeb packs quite a punch.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.840
I'm sure, I'm sure.

11:56.925 --> 12:00.719
But really, I mean,
joopa supposedly love Lasats.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.888
They love them? What do you mean?

12:02.972 --> 12:05.391
Well, they say they love the smell,

12:05.475 --> 12:08.018
or I guess they love the taste as well.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.729
And maybe it's about the texture.
You know...

12:10.814 --> 12:13.565
Wait, Zeb's not the hunter.
He's the bait.

12:13.650 --> 12:17.194
Hunter, bait, it's all the same.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.655
No, it's not!

12:23.493 --> 12:25.411
Zeb, you better get back here right now!

12:25.495 --> 12:26.662
Zeb, what is that?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.622
Buddy, run! You're the bait!

12:28.706 --> 12:30.416
Zeb, it's gonna eat you!

12:30.500 --> 12:32.501
Oh, karabast.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.503
-Zeb, run!
-Get out of there!

12:34.587 --> 12:36.505
-What are you doing?
-Run!

12:38.842 --> 12:39.842
Zeb, no!

12:47.725 --> 12:49.309
This could be him!

12:49.394 --> 12:51.520
Our Big Bongo!

12:56.443 --> 12:58.610
Hey, I bet you know a thing or two
about mechanics.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.862
Yeah, good bet.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.947
Keep an eye on this regulator.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.615
The line can overheat and shut down.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.118
No line, no joopa, no Zeb.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.494
Got it.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.872
Well, what about me and him?

13:10.415 --> 13:12.541
You got the best job of all!

13:12.625 --> 13:15.961
When the line swings around,
you'll charge it with the electro-poles.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.921
Hit the line with the rod, and it'll send

13:18.006 --> 13:20.424
a bolt of energy down to the joopa.

13:20.508 --> 13:24.386
Do it enough, and you should
bring it up to the surface.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.973
-Here's one for you, General.
-Don't call me that.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.058
-I was never a general.
-My mistake.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.436
-Sorry, Commander.
-No, it's not...

13:43.781 --> 13:44.907
Hit it! Now!

13:51.623 --> 13:52.998
That's it! That's it!

13:53.082 --> 13:54.833
He didn't like that!

13:54.918 --> 13:56.210
Hit him again!

13:59.631 --> 14:00.714
He's a runnin'.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.468
Hit that line! Bring him up.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.521
-We're losing the regulator.
-Full stop, Wolffe! Dig in!

14:15.605 --> 14:17.272
This is where we finish the battle!

14:31.371 --> 14:32.704
I can't reach it!

14:32.789 --> 14:34.831
Kanan, lift me up!

14:35.708 --> 14:36.708
Sabine!

14:37.126 --> 14:39.461
I know, I know. Working on it!

14:50.807 --> 14:52.307
Got it.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.564
Ezra?

15:16.541 --> 15:17.583
Go!

15:18.835 --> 15:20.502
It is Big Bongo!

15:47.363 --> 15:48.530
What a smell.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.698
Zeb!

15:49.866 --> 15:51.366
Nice catch, old-timers.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.369
Yeah!

15:54.454 --> 15:56.204
Way to go.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.291
Now that, that was impressive.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.836
Impressive? You almost
got my friend eaten!

16:03.129 --> 16:04.379
Yeah.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.050
I was in that thing's mouth!

16:08.676 --> 16:10.344
Head to toe.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.720
But look at you.

16:11.804 --> 16:15.182
You brought in our biggest catch ever.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.351
I... I did?

16:18.186 --> 16:20.979
Actually, it wasn't so bad, Kanan.

16:21.064 --> 16:25.067
I... I knew I had the beast
from the beginning.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.236
And you are a natural.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.365
We held up our end
of the deal, Captain.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.575
Now it's time to get us
those coordinates so we can go.

16:34.243 --> 16:37.079
I'll get 'em. But you might consider
staying for dinner.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.499
It's gonna be delicious!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.751
That thing tried to eat me.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.629
Only fair I get to see how it tastes.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.632
Can't say no to that. Right, Kanan?

17:02.939 --> 17:04.064
Clones, huh?

17:04.524 --> 17:06.441
Ahsoka's always full of surprises.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.110
Well, don't get your hopes up.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.986
The great leader's
not coming back with us.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.446
And you don't want him to.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.991
I understand your fears,

17:15.076 --> 17:18.620
but I also remember when the Jedi
and clones fought side by side.

17:18.705 --> 17:22.124
They saved billions of lives,
including my own.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.001
I know.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.713
Then maybe that's a start.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.256
I gotta get back to these repairs

17:29.340 --> 17:31.299
if we're ever gonna
get out of this system.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.468
Signal when you're en route.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.280
I've assembled a list of

17:53.364 --> 17:55.240
potential bases and clearance codes

17:55.324 --> 17:57.993
and a few protocols
the Imperials still use.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.245
-Should be of some use.
-Thanks, Rex.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.747
They're on our main computer.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.207
-You're gonna need...
-Data tapes? I got this.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.628
You were brave today, kid.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.172
You jumped right in there to help.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.424
A great Jedi once told me

18:12.508 --> 18:14.593
that the best leaders lead by example.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.219
You do that well.

18:16.929 --> 18:20.766
Thanks. I've learned
from a great Jedi too. Kanan.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.229
You know, I don't think he likes me.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.522
Or ever will.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.108
Can't say I blame him.

18:30.193 --> 18:32.277
The war left its scars on all of us.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.029
Won't you reconsider joining us?

18:34.530 --> 18:37.240
You know, I've out served my purpose

18:37.325 --> 18:39.618
for that kind of fighting, I'm afraid.

18:39.702 --> 18:43.121
After the war, I questioned
the point of the whole thing.

18:43.206 --> 18:46.166
All those men died, and for what?

18:47.418 --> 18:48.960
I guess

18:49.045 --> 18:50.504
what they thought was right.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.811
The clones gave us up.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.646
They warned the Empire we're here.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.231
-Wait, what?
-You're mistaken.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.357
We would never do that.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.984
I found the binary transmission
to the Empire.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.153
And there are messages
Ahsoka sent to Rex,

19:15.238 --> 19:16.363
and he never answered her!

19:16.447 --> 19:18.657
What? I never got any messages

19:18.741 --> 19:20.534
from Commander Tano.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.495
I knew it! I told you,

19:23.579 --> 19:25.622
-they can't be trusted.
-Kanan, wait.

19:25.915 --> 19:26.915
ls this true?

19:28.209 --> 19:30.710
Wolffe. What did you do?

19:31.337 --> 19:33.547
I... I contacted the Empire.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.465
lf they found out
that we were helping Jedi,

19:35.550 --> 19:36.591
they'd wipe us out.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.926
Sabine, go warn Hera.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.053
Tell her to scan for incoming ships.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.973
I wanted to protect you guys,
protect our squad.

19:43.057 --> 19:46.101
The war is over. We are free men.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.103
We can't live
under the fear of the Empire

19:48.187 --> 19:49.688
for the rest of our lives, Wolffe.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.189
That's not freedom.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.482
You're right.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.317
They're not our enemy.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.361
I'm sorry.

19:59.365 --> 20:00.365
A probe?

20:02.285 --> 20:03.410
Kanan!

20:10.167 --> 20:11.835
-Oh, my.
-Look out!

20:11.919 --> 20:13.670
Probes! I hate probes!

20:26.517 --> 20:28.018
Rex.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.477
You gotta make this right.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.491
Yes!

20:44.243 --> 20:45.327
Nice shot.

20:46.829 --> 20:47.871
Rex got him.

20:48.706 --> 20:49.998
Probe deserved it.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.599
How long has this thing
been watching us?

21:07.683 --> 21:08.850
Long enough.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.603
-How's the Phantom?
-Well, engine took a direct hit.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.355
We're not going anywhere
until I can fix it.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.315
Wait. You mean we're stranded?

21:15.399 --> 21:16.441
Yep.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.027
And the Empire's on its way.
