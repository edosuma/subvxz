01:05.432 --> 01:08.162
Dragon Tiger Gate was founded...

01:08.368 --> 01:10.131
by 2 kung fu masters:

01:10.336 --> 01:12.770
Wong Jianglong and Wong Fuhu.

01:13.206 --> 01:16.266
They promoted self-strengthening...

01:16.843 --> 01:19.334
to free people from oppression.

01:19.779 --> 01:21.508
They even taught martial arts...

01:21.714 --> 01:24.683
to street urchins.

01:25.485 --> 01:28.477
The Gate thus became
the symbol of Justice.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.380
While every youth
was eager to join the Gate...

01:32.725 --> 01:35.694
Wong Fuhu's son,

01:35.895 --> 01:37.726
Dragon,

01:37.931 --> 01:40.058
decided to leave.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.225
He was to part

01:42.435 --> 01:44.266
with his baby brother,

01:44.471 --> 01:46.200
Tiger.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.211
Shibumi

02:29.115 --> 02:33.051
Rosa, Ma Kun's been doing a good job.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.687
I decide to continue our collaboration.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.857
Give him the Lousha Plaque.

02:38.057 --> 02:40.992
Ask him to keep up his work!

02:41.961 --> 02:46.159
Remember, the plaque
represents Lousha Gang.

02:52.238 --> 02:54.229
I've given you the Lousha Plaque.

02:54.674 --> 02:55.538
Don't let anything

02:55.742 --> 02:57.710
happen to it.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.943
I know. I'll do my best.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.219
What a coincidence!

03:17.864 --> 03:19.229
Still remember me?

03:21.701 --> 03:23.293
- Xiao... - That's right!

03:23.703 --> 03:25.364
So you still remember me!

03:26.973 --> 03:29.874
Grade 5?

03:30.910 --> 03:33.674
Not Grade 5! Grade 3!

03:34.881 --> 03:36.280
Almost the same.

03:37.417 --> 03:41.615
Not at all. What a poor memory!

03:41.921 --> 03:44.549
Remember the fatso in our class?

03:44.757 --> 03:47.248
Sure, the one who bawled all the time?

03:48.061 --> 03:51.553
No, the one who wetted his pants!

03:52.865 --> 03:55.026
Well, he bawled after
he wetted his pants!

03:55.335 --> 03:57.735
I remember he liked pulling your plait!

03:58.104 --> 04:01.596
It couldn't be! I had short hair then.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.878
I remember you had long hair!

04:07.981 --> 04:10.347
How can I forget I had short hair?

04:10.883 --> 04:13.818
Like, would you forget
you're called Chan?

04:17.457 --> 04:18.685
Look who has a poor memory?

04:18.891 --> 04:21.485
I'm not Chan, Xiaowei!

04:30.103 --> 04:32.367
I'm not Xiaowei!

04:38.044 --> 04:39.807
- I'm sorry! - I'm sorry!

04:47.820 --> 04:49.481
So what's your name?

04:50.523 --> 04:51.751
Tiger Wong.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.389
I'm Ma Xiaoling.

05:16.749 --> 05:18.114
- Hey - Hey, Tiger!

05:18.318 --> 05:19.182
Why so many people?

05:19.385 --> 05:21.945
Ma Kun has reserved...

05:22.155 --> 05:23.315
the whole upper floor.

05:23.523 --> 05:24.581
Ma Kun?

05:24.857 --> 05:26.984
The biggest kingpin in Hong Kong.

05:27.193 --> 05:30.424
Those dudes in black are his dogs.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.963
Some dudes in white are barging in!

05:41.474 --> 05:44.637
They're the White Lions.
As powerful as Kun!

05:45.311 --> 05:46.141
Black or white,

05:46.346 --> 05:48.041
they're still bad guys!

05:51.484 --> 05:54.009
Kun, so you got the plaque again.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.184
You have monopoly
over all smuggling gigs.

05:58.091 --> 06:01.288
It takes juice to work with Lousha Gang.

06:01.494 --> 06:04.429
You gotta work harder!

06:05.198 --> 06:07.359
Juice? I got much more than you!

06:07.567 --> 06:08.898
To hell with your gigs.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.933
I want half of your cut!

06:11.137 --> 06:12.866
You kiddin' or what?

06:13.106 --> 06:14.073
Whoever has the plaque

06:14.273 --> 06:16.605
can get all the cut.

06:16.809 --> 06:20.006
You want half? You outta your mind?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.215
Nice food! It's pay-up time!

06:27.954 --> 06:28.511
Mom!

06:28.721 --> 06:30.586
How dare you welsh

06:30.790 --> 06:31.586
on our debts?

06:31.791 --> 06:32.849
Not that I don't wanna pay.
We're the victims!

06:33.059 --> 06:34.526
We've paid a lot already!

06:35.161 --> 06:37.686
Let them be. They are Kun's dogs!

06:38.231 --> 06:41.428
Stay put! Master won't like it!

06:43.903 --> 06:46.303
Shibumi gave me the plaque.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.698
Come get it if you dare!

06:59.385 --> 07:00.374
Even if I let you go,

07:00.586 --> 07:02.315
my boss Scaly won't!

07:04.557 --> 07:07.617
Enjoying your food, huh?

07:09.095 --> 07:10.289
Tiger!

07:49.602 --> 07:50.796
Where's the plaque?

07:53.406 --> 07:54.395
Who are you?

07:54.607 --> 07:56.074
Tiger Wong!

07:57.043 --> 07:59.034
Find the plaque...

07:59.245 --> 08:00.644
or you can't leave!

08:14.694 --> 08:16.525
I'll take sole responsibility
for what I've done!

09:32.071 --> 09:33.265
Go down!

10:40.940 --> 10:42.430
Let him go!

10:45.211 --> 10:46.906
Why?

10:57.223 --> 11:00.852
Gosh! Scaly has gone way out of hand!

11:01.394 --> 11:04.158
All crap!

11:09.402 --> 11:10.892
What you starin' at, Dragon Wong?

11:11.470 --> 11:12.937
You wanna fight me one on one?

11:15.474 --> 11:16.634
Why you let that kid

11:16.842 --> 11:18.810
go just now, Kun?

11:19.011 --> 11:20.842
None of them were able to beat him.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.139
And the White Lions were watching.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.282
If Kun hadn't let him go...

11:24.483 --> 11:25.609
the two gangs could have started fighting.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.115
What good would that do, you crazy dog?

11:27.319 --> 11:28.286
Who cares about the White Lions?

11:28.487 --> 11:30.148
You're just a bodyguard.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.789
I could have taken him out on my own!

11:31.991 --> 11:34.221
I'm good!

11:34.527 --> 11:36.119
- Scaly...
- Come fight me one on one!

11:37.229 --> 11:38.491
Scram!

11:39.865 --> 11:41.298
You better watch out!

11:46.906 --> 11:48.237
Why didn't you...

11:48.441 --> 11:49.999
go all the way...

11:50.209 --> 11:51.904
when fighting the kid?

12:00.820 --> 12:04.688
I will get you the plaque back.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.016
Stop eating!
Look how heavy the plaque is!

12:40.226 --> 12:41.215
Why is the plaque with you?

12:41.427 --> 12:43.224
I snatched it when you were fighting.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.623
Hey! Let me see! Look!

12:44.830 --> 12:46.559
We can fence it for some dough!

12:46.766 --> 12:47.755
Sure can!

12:47.967 --> 12:50.265
We can donate the money for charity.

12:50.569 --> 12:53.060
Charity? What a waste!

12:53.272 --> 12:54.637
So who's the boss today?

12:54.840 --> 12:57.707
Tiger, of course!

12:57.943 --> 12:58.705
Hey you guys!

12:58.911 --> 12:59.411
Me again?

12:59.578 --> 13:00.670
Come! In sum...

13:00.880 --> 13:04.008
Tiger is virtuous and generous.
He's perfect!

13:04.216 --> 13:06.844
Indeed! Cheers!

13:07.219 --> 13:09.312
- Cheers! - Thanks!

13:11.724 --> 13:13.123
Just dig in!

13:13.492 --> 13:15.392
Pass me the whole plate!

13:45.457 --> 13:48.221
The sushi today is so good! So delicious!

13:48.427 --> 13:50.327
Two more orders please!

13:50.529 --> 13:51.757
Hurry up!

13:53.032 --> 13:54.590
Tiger is our boss today.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.461
He'll start first.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.263
Tiger, that's for you!

13:59.605 --> 14:02.631
And this is for me!

14:04.210 --> 14:05.802
Gimme the plaque.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.006
The plaque?

14:09.048 --> 14:12.142
What plaque?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.012
This one?

14:14.486 --> 14:15.817
The plaque is your head!

14:17.056 --> 14:18.546
You want this?

14:18.757 --> 14:20.452
How much can you pay?

14:35.507 --> 14:36.769
You weren't all that bad last time!

14:36.976 --> 14:38.170
Dragon!

14:40.179 --> 14:40.873
You got lost or what?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.672
I come here to give you a hand!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.406
I've put drugs in their wine!

14:44.617 --> 14:46.084
I already got the plaque.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.980
I hate dirty tricks!

14:48.187 --> 14:50.382
The plaque is ours.
They're having fun with it.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.682
We got every right to beat them up.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.092
What did you say before? Me dirty?

14:55.294 --> 14:58.229
You dumbhead. Let me teach you a lesson!

14:58.430 --> 14:59.658
Beat him up!

15:05.304 --> 15:07.295
You dare to touch me?

15:07.506 --> 15:08.871
Beat him up too!

15:11.577 --> 15:13.568
You guys will need
an ambulance real soon!

15:17.683 --> 15:20.277
I said beat him up!
Who you fightin' with?

16:33.425 --> 16:35.689
Dragon Wong!

16:37.730 --> 16:39.755
Didn't you say you're a good fighter?

16:48.607 --> 16:50.006
Go in!

16:53.679 --> 16:55.977
Beat the crap outta anyone you see!

17:40.626 --> 17:42.787
I hate to be disturbed at my meals.

18:39.017 --> 18:40.678
Your nunchaku sucks.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.513
Better practice more!

18:45.290 --> 18:47.121
Let's practice together sometimes!

18:51.997 --> 18:52.929
Thanks for your help!

18:53.132 --> 18:56.067
You're welcome. Just couldn't stand them!

18:59.605 --> 19:00.731
I'm Turbo.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.462
Tiger.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.039
Tiger?

19:04.243 --> 19:06.768
A fierce name! Gotta split now!

19:11.483 --> 19:12.507
You guys okay?

19:12.718 --> 19:14.845
We're fine.

19:15.187 --> 19:16.745
No blood was shed.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.523
Hey, is that yours? I just found it.

19:26.532 --> 19:28.193
Tiger!

19:29.434 --> 19:31.527
Where's Dragon Tiger Gate?

20:15.747 --> 20:17.180
Baldy, you snatched the plaque.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.680
You better explain
to the Master yourself.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.658
Stop staring. You can touch it.

20:46.144 --> 20:49.238
I got this scar when I was a kid.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.582
When I was at your age,

20:51.783 --> 20:53.876
I already knew kung fu well.

20:54.152 --> 20:56.177
Once I passed by
someone wielding his sword.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.754
And there went this scar!

20:59.625 --> 21:01.855
It's such a big golden plaque.

21:02.060 --> 21:02.992
I had to snatch it.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.719
Then this long-haired guy
asked me for it.

21:04.930 --> 21:05.794
Of course I wouldn't give it to him.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.056
So he beat us up.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.733
He punched me and I parried...

21:08.934 --> 21:10.424
like what you taught us.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.399
And the rest is history.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.435
We're really not to blame!

21:14.640 --> 21:17.131
Indeed, Master! We're not to blame!

21:17.342 --> 21:20.209
The plaque you snatched
is called Lousha Plaque.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.446
It's the transaction permit

21:22.648 --> 21:25.082
between Lousha Gang and Kun.

21:26.151 --> 21:29.120
Lousha Gang is a crime organization.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.951
You snatched their stuff...

21:33.659 --> 21:35.024
and claimed you're innocent?

21:35.694 --> 21:38.185
Get out and squat for 3 hours!

21:41.733 --> 21:44.668
Would someone gimme a hand? I can't see!

21:44.870 --> 21:46.701
3 hours already!

21:54.613 --> 21:55.978
Uncle.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.974
I saw my brother again.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.448
He's Kun's man now.

22:03.188 --> 22:05.520
So he's tied to Lousha Gang.

22:06.758 --> 22:08.555
But I don't believe he's a bad guy.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.923
Bring him back to the Gate.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.798
Master,

22:16.501 --> 22:18.799
I'm Turbo from overseas.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.030
I was invincible in Chinatown...

22:22.240 --> 22:24.606
But I know...

22:24.810 --> 22:27.472
you're well versed in martial arts.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.668
I wanna aggregate

22:28.880 --> 22:31.405
the skills of all schools...

22:31.616 --> 22:34.346
to manifest the spirits
of Chinese kung fu.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.453
I'd therefore like to be your disciple.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.588
I'll be your disciple no matter what!

22:53.138 --> 22:54.503
You still here?

22:54.906 --> 22:55.964
Wait!

22:56.274 --> 22:57.866
I ain't gonna give up!

22:59.411 --> 23:01.174
You're great in nunchaku.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.213
Can you teach me?

23:04.916 --> 23:07.612
I won't teach you.
But we can practice together.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.952
Great!

23:18.697 --> 23:20.358
Where's your nunchaku?

23:25.203 --> 23:27.262
By the way, I'm also called the Judo Kid!

23:27.472 --> 23:28.632
Come on!

23:34.413 --> 23:36.574
Wow, excellent footwork!

23:37.315 --> 23:39.647
By the way, how you got that scar?

23:40.118 --> 23:41.085
How you got that scar?

23:41.286 --> 23:42.184
I can't hear you.

23:42.387 --> 23:43.354
I said your scar...

23:46.591 --> 23:49.958
I got the scar while practicing.

23:50.695 --> 23:53.095
But the other guy is a limp now.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.794
So be careful!

24:16.788 --> 24:19.382
Dragon, Come over!

24:28.433 --> 24:30.594
It's for Dad's safety.

24:30.802 --> 24:31.962
Let's do it together.

24:32.170 --> 24:33.899
Am I not good enough...

24:34.105 --> 24:35.697
to protect you?

24:35.907 --> 24:37.636
Come fight me!

24:37.909 --> 24:42.312
No way! I don't wanna kill you!

24:43.048 --> 24:44.413
Then I'll die for sure

24:44.616 --> 24:46.311
Better rely on yourself than on gods.

24:46.518 --> 24:48.486
I won't let anything happen to you...

24:48.687 --> 24:50.518
or your dad.

24:52.524 --> 24:55.550
If Dad retired,

24:55.760 --> 24:57.785
you wouldn't need to protect us.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.294
We'd all be safe then.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.229
Where would you go

25:05.437 --> 25:07.405
if you could retire?

25:12.177 --> 25:13.610
Take this one first.

25:13.812 --> 25:16.406
I'll go get another one.

25:31.162 --> 25:33.062
Mom, did Tiger's mom

25:33.265 --> 25:34.732
take Dad away from us?

25:34.933 --> 25:36.798
I hate them!

25:37.502 --> 25:39.299
You shouldn't hate

25:39.504 --> 25:41.563
any member of the Gate.

25:41.973 --> 25:43.065
Dad and I separated

25:43.275 --> 25:44.970
not because of them.

25:45.176 --> 25:47.542
It's my own decision.

25:48.813 --> 25:52.146
Dragon, come out! It's Tiger!

25:52.250 --> 25:54.543
Go away! Don't come see me anymore!

25:54.653 --> 25:57.051
I don't wanna see anyone
from the Gate ever!

25:57.155 --> 25:59.214
Get lost!

26:14.272 --> 26:15.632
Why you crying?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.669
I'll beat you till you smile!

26:24.149 --> 26:26.777
Stop! Stop!

26:34.226 --> 26:35.857
Stop him. Don't let him run away.

26:35.961 --> 26:36.950
Stop!

26:37.162 --> 26:39.528
Still running, smart ass?

26:39.998 --> 26:41.295
Wanna fight back?

26:41.867 --> 26:43.159
What you guys want?

26:43.268 --> 26:44.496
What?

26:44.703 --> 26:45.795
Beat him up!

26:49.641 --> 26:51.131
Take his slipper!

26:51.343 --> 26:53.538
Don't come back to this park again!

26:53.745 --> 26:55.542
Let's go!

27:08.360 --> 27:09.759
Hurry up, Tiger!

27:11.129 --> 27:12.858
Okay. I'm coming!

27:18.470 --> 27:19.903
Let me give you my slipper,

27:20.105 --> 27:22.539
or your mom will yell at you.

27:22.741 --> 27:24.800
What about your mom?

27:24.910 --> 27:26.168
It won't be a problem.

27:26.277 --> 27:27.869
Thanks!

27:30.582 --> 27:33.578
You don't wanna know
why I was in a fight?

27:35.687 --> 27:38.622
'Cos I know Dragon is a man of justice.

27:38.890 --> 27:40.380
Unless they're in the wrong,

27:40.692 --> 27:42.922
you wouldn't have picked a fight.

27:43.128 --> 27:44.857
They were bullying Tiger.

27:45.263 --> 27:48.699
So I fought with them.

28:00.111 --> 28:01.872
Carry this jade pendant with you.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.742
You're a member of the Gate
wherever you go.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.944
You'll make it big in the future.

28:08.253 --> 28:11.188
Remember you're Wong Fuhu's son.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.224
Don't ever commit a crime.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.149
Your life...

28:16.261 --> 28:19.089
will be fraught with frustrations.

28:19.364 --> 28:23.059
You will come back to the Gate
with your head up.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.435
Never give up

28:25.537 --> 28:28.196
however difficult life will become.

28:29.107 --> 28:31.241
What you meant by "make it big"?

28:31.509 --> 28:33.370
You'll know when you grow up.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.980
Come!

28:39.984 --> 28:42.214
When will I make it big?

28:54.632 --> 28:56.623
Dragon, your mom

28:56.835 --> 28:58.826
hasn't come out yet!

29:00.071 --> 29:02.335
Mom never came out.

29:03.308 --> 29:05.208
She was never seen again.

29:06.544 --> 29:08.341
It's lucky

29:08.747 --> 29:10.544
I met Kun.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.777
Out of gratitude,

29:15.954 --> 29:19.048
I've done reluctant things for him.

29:20.158 --> 29:22.490
I know I can't leave here...

29:23.094 --> 29:26.086
I'm ashamed to go back
to the Gate ever again.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.541
Dragon!

29:53.558 --> 29:55.355
I'm your baby brother!

29:55.727 --> 29:57.922
I know. So what?

29:58.129 --> 30:00.290
Am I supposed to hug you
with tears in my eyes?

30:00.498 --> 30:04.161
And you hug me and call me Bro?

30:07.672 --> 30:09.970
Uncle and I want you back to the Gate.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.672
Don't work for this bad guy Kun anymore!

30:16.581 --> 30:19.550
So you're a good guy and I'm a bad guy.

30:20.084 --> 30:21.108
Go back to the Gate

30:21.319 --> 30:23.116
and play your good guy!

30:56.454 --> 30:57.819
Chan!

30:59.224 --> 31:00.623
I'm Tiger Wong.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.427
You're no fun!

31:06.164 --> 31:07.825
You and Dragon are tight?

31:09.434 --> 31:12.597
He works for my dad.
I treat him like a brother.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.465
You're his baby brother?

31:15.106 --> 31:17.438
You don't look alike.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.374
You guys are brothers.

31:21.746 --> 31:23.907
Why you act like that?

31:28.953 --> 31:30.580
That's why I wanna help him.

31:33.191 --> 31:36.422
Good! Gimme your phone.

31:54.779 --> 31:56.713
Listen. Hurry up!

31:59.083 --> 32:01.017
- Hello. - Hello.

32:05.556 --> 32:08.616
This is my number. Remember to call me!

32:11.496 --> 32:14.294
Aren't you gonna help me?

32:14.966 --> 32:18.299
Sure, but I didn't say now.

32:19.003 --> 32:21.631
I'll call you when I find him. Bye.

32:47.565 --> 32:50.728
Thanks for taking care
of Scaly and his dogs.

32:50.935 --> 32:52.926
They've been nothing but trouble lately.

32:53.404 --> 32:55.065
You can always quit.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.065
Not so simple!

32:58.843 --> 33:02.210
What's so hard?

33:04.716 --> 33:06.616
I've been in this biz forever.

33:07.051 --> 33:09.713
Xiaoling is my only worry.

33:10.855 --> 33:14.848
I've taken you for my dad,

33:15.360 --> 33:17.385
and Xiaoling my sis.

33:21.566 --> 33:24.592
I won't let anything
bad happen to my folks.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.631
I believe you.

33:28.906 --> 33:30.533
Just sleep on it.

33:31.843 --> 33:35.506
And you? Will you go back to the Gate?

33:35.847 --> 33:37.405
Yes,

33:38.349 --> 33:39.543
but it's not the right time yet.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.378
I'll wait till you've retired.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.383
Wanna get rid of me?

33:46.691 --> 33:50.286
Yes. Give the plaque back to Lousha Gang.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.893
Nunchaku Slippers! Watch out!

34:38.909 --> 34:41.400
You should be practicing!

34:42.146 --> 34:44.045
Playing with slippers?

34:44.248 --> 34:47.081
No more slippers for a month.

34:47.284 --> 34:48.775
Take them all off!

35:04.602 --> 35:08.663
You don't wanna teach me.

35:09.974 --> 35:11.601
At least practice with me!

35:14.479 --> 35:16.504
You're best at nunchaku?

35:17.381 --> 35:18.712
Yes.

35:19.183 --> 35:22.243
Please pick a weapon, Master!

35:51.849 --> 35:54.079
You're clueless.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.616
Worse than the kids.

35:58.422 --> 36:01.050
You know nothing about nunchaku.

36:01.425 --> 36:02.915
Come back when you know...

36:03.127 --> 36:06.255
how to grasp a nunchaku.

36:39.163 --> 36:40.391
I'm Turbo,

36:40.598 --> 36:43.328
invincible in Chinatown.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.028
You're clueless.

36:48.973 --> 36:51.305
You know nothing nunchaku.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.501
Come back when you know...

36:53.711 --> 36:57.169
how to grasp a nunchaku.

37:20.271 --> 37:23.331
I was always bullied as I grew up abroad.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.800
I didn't like that.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.807
So I slashed a scar on my face.

37:30.281 --> 37:32.545
I wanna scare people off.

37:33.551 --> 37:36.145
I learnt nunchaku

37:36.754 --> 37:39.279
'cos it's fierce and powerful.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.424
But today I was totally beaten.

37:45.162 --> 37:47.824
I thought I had grasped it very hard...

37:48.699 --> 37:51.224
but he took it from me so easily!

37:53.604 --> 37:55.333
After a long struggle,

37:56.340 --> 37:58.035
I finally realized...

37:59.143 --> 38:03.341
it's not a matter of strength...

38:04.649 --> 38:06.640
but of the heart.

38:08.319 --> 38:10.412
I can't scare people...

38:10.788 --> 38:13.279
with a scar on my face.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.289
I won't tell my scar story anymore.

38:21.365 --> 38:23.560
But I'll say...

38:24.502 --> 38:28.131
Master Wong left
a slipper mark on my face.

38:32.743 --> 38:34.438
I will keep it up.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.980
Thanks!

38:49.260 --> 38:50.852
Turbo!

38:56.267 --> 39:00.169
You know how to do household chores?

39:00.371 --> 39:03.772
I don't, but I will learn!

39:18.956 --> 39:22.016
Kun wants to return
the plaque and retire?

39:22.226 --> 39:25.127
That's good news for you.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.569
I'll arrange for you to join Lousha Gang.

39:34.472 --> 39:38.431
That way... we can be together.

39:44.248 --> 39:46.341
Why are you staring at me?

39:47.385 --> 39:48.943
I want you to understand...

39:49.153 --> 39:52.213
I can make Shibumi
let you take Kun's place.

39:52.590 --> 39:56.356
You can be your own boss finally!

39:57.561 --> 40:00.029
I shouldn't have rescued you that day.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.450
Listen up, Dragon!

40:23.654 --> 40:25.815
Whether you join the Gang or not,

40:27.725 --> 40:31.593
we ain't good guys.

40:50.881 --> 40:54.908
We cannot change our fate.

41:15.105 --> 41:16.936
- Dragon, I... - Xiaoling.

41:17.608 --> 41:19.098
You know Tiger?

41:19.477 --> 41:20.774
Yeah.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.442
Arrange a meeting for us,

41:23.447 --> 41:24.675
please.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.773
You know where we are?

41:52.877 --> 41:55.345
You won't recall. You were just a kid.

41:55.713 --> 41:56.941
It used to be a park.

41:57.147 --> 41:59.741
And there was a monkey bar here.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.174
After we were beaten,

42:01.385 --> 42:03.046
you liked to hide here.

42:04.455 --> 42:06.980
I'll learn my kung fu well.
I'll beat them up!

42:07.224 --> 42:10.523
Kung fu is for protecting people,

42:10.728 --> 42:13.060
not for fighting.

42:13.631 --> 42:15.292
We will never be bad guys

42:15.499 --> 42:16.431
no matter what.

42:16.634 --> 42:17.828
Got it?

42:18.035 --> 42:19.297
Got it.

42:20.271 --> 42:24.002
Look! That's the direction
to the Dragon Tiger Gate.

42:26.243 --> 42:28.677
Ever beaten anyone you shouldn't have?

42:29.914 --> 42:32.678
No! Never!

42:34.318 --> 42:37.913
But I have. Many times!

42:39.323 --> 42:40.654
Many things

42:40.858 --> 42:43.088
have happened to me,

42:44.528 --> 42:47.258
but you won't understand.

42:48.632 --> 42:51.533
I wanna tell you today...

42:52.603 --> 42:54.503
I'm proud of you.

42:55.005 --> 42:57.599
'Cos you can stick to your principles!

42:57.808 --> 42:59.469
I also have my principles.

43:00.344 --> 43:02.437
I know where I should go.

43:07.585 --> 43:08.984
Let's go.

43:11.555 --> 43:12.715
Hey!

43:12.990 --> 43:14.252
I'll wait for you at home!

43:14.458 --> 43:17.484
Cool. See you at the Gate!

43:26.904 --> 43:29.930
Giving up the plaque is an insult to me!

43:31.008 --> 43:32.373
Rosa.

43:32.576 --> 43:35.568
Both Kun and Dragon must die!

43:35.779 --> 43:37.610
Watch out!

43:37.948 --> 43:40.280
Xiaoling, show us what you got!

43:40.484 --> 43:42.850
Do your best, Xiaoling!

43:59.303 --> 44:01.737
Dad, how did I do?

44:02.239 --> 44:03.365
Not too bad.

44:04.508 --> 44:06.305
I'm the best

44:06.510 --> 44:08.501
in the team.

44:08.712 --> 44:10.236
And you call that "not too bad"?!

44:10.447 --> 44:13.610
I was the best softball player once.

44:13.817 --> 44:17.253
Your game is just kiddy stuff for me!

44:17.655 --> 44:18.849
Cool!

44:19.056 --> 44:21.616
If you're so good, let's play a game!

44:21.825 --> 44:23.292
Okay, you arrange it.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.361
But you better get changed now.
We'll go eat.

44:26.563 --> 44:27.530
Dragon is on his way.

44:27.731 --> 44:28.925
Cool!

44:33.637 --> 44:34.535
Hello.

44:34.738 --> 44:37.104
Dragon, I have to see you now.

44:37.441 --> 44:38.931
But I don't feel like it.

44:40.811 --> 44:42.608
You'll regret if you don't show up.

45:07.071 --> 45:11.030
So fast! You must miss me!

45:20.818 --> 45:24.151
Have you ever done it in the water?

45:28.959 --> 45:29.653
I thought you had

45:29.860 --> 45:32.021
something urgent to tell me.

45:42.473 --> 45:44.031
Tattoo for me.

45:45.843 --> 45:47.868
Why?

45:49.413 --> 45:52.610
My birthday present.

45:54.051 --> 45:56.144
You have birthday?

45:56.854 --> 45:59.880
You saved me years ago.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.490
To me, that's my birthday.

46:10.167 --> 46:14.126
Forget it. I know you won't.

46:20.544 --> 46:21.977
Turn around.

46:44.134 --> 46:45.658
Go away!

46:46.170 --> 46:47.865
You'll fall to your death!

46:48.071 --> 46:50.164
None of your business. Go way!

46:50.374 --> 46:53.172
Jump down and I'll catch you.

47:02.820 --> 47:03.787
What's your name?

47:03.987 --> 47:05.454
Dragon.

47:06.690 --> 47:07.349
Yours?

47:07.558 --> 47:08.957
Rosa.

47:12.896 --> 47:13.885
What you staring at?

47:14.097 --> 47:15.530
Can't I stare?

47:20.337 --> 47:22.362
I'll be in love with you forever.

47:32.749 --> 47:34.783
What have you tattooed for me?

47:57.908 --> 48:00.668
I've always wanted to
stare at you like that.

48:07.618 --> 48:09.210
I was supposed to kill you.

48:09.486 --> 48:11.181
Double Devils are off to kill Kun.

48:11.455 --> 48:13.320
It's too late.

50:15.512 --> 50:16.479
Go to hell!

50:20.317 --> 50:21.716
You bloody old man!

50:22.019 --> 50:25.113
I'm good but you treat me like shit!

50:25.322 --> 50:27.715
Better to work for
Lousha Gang than for you.

50:28.291 --> 50:31.624
Retire? Not so easy!

50:31.828 --> 50:33.455
Let me retire you now!

50:35.365 --> 50:37.094
Don't hit me, Kun!

50:37.300 --> 50:40.201
I was just kiddin'!

50:40.404 --> 50:42.972
- You back-stabbing asshole!
- Let me retire with you.

50:46.176 --> 50:48.303
Help! Double Devils!

50:48.512 --> 50:51.242
Help!

51:12.903 --> 51:14.302
Dad!

55:25.889 --> 55:27.789
Watch over her!

57:07.056 --> 57:09.991
Remember you're Wong Fuhu's son.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.794
You'll make it big in the future.

57:13.229 --> 57:16.164
You will come back to the Gate
with your head up.

57:16.499 --> 57:18.160
Never give up...

57:18.368 --> 57:20.495
however difficult life will become.

58:42.418 --> 58:44.147
My dad...

58:44.721 --> 58:46.712
Will he go to heaven?

58:49.092 --> 58:53.119
He will. He loved you so much.

58:59.402 --> 59:03.304
Better ask when the bad guys
will go to hell!

59:07.877 --> 59:10.409
From now on, the Gate is your home.

59:11.080 --> 59:13.514
Even if my limps are broken,

59:13.816 --> 59:15.977
I won't let anyone harm you.

59:55.625 --> 59:59.561
Double Devils were beaten
by people from the Gate.

01:00:03.566 --> 01:00:05.761
The Gate is really that strong?

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.029
Good!

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.008
Master,

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.815
we haven't found Tiger yet.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.881
Baldy and others are searching for him!

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:36.660
Who's the best here?

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:34.653
Watch out for...

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:36.855
the "Black Pagoda"!

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:05.872
So Dragon Tiger Gate's kung fu sucks!

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:46.281
You're not good enough
to die under my hands!

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.472
But you can!

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:22.124
Find your brother.

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:25.852
Guard the Gate together...

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:02.459
Xiaoling, should anything
happen to anyone...

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:04.189
bring them to Mt Baiyun...

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.368
and look for a guy called Qi.

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:57.277
Master!

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:04.146
Master! Master...

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:06.844
Please save my friends!

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:12.885
Their wounds are too deep for me.

01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:15.526
All over Mt Baiyun,

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:19.326
Only Qi can help them.

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:22.033
Where can I find Qi?

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:25.196
Inside the pagoda.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:28.636
I'll find him once I get up there?

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:31.904
No one has ever entered the pagoda!

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.751
Stay put!

01:07:39.021 --> 01:07:40.989
Pick up the prayer beads.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:59.166
Pick up all the prayer beads.

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:58.991
Master Qi

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.817
Here are all the prayer beads.

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:28.292
Please save my friends.

01:09:28.596 --> 01:09:30.997
There's still one bead below the pagoda.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.694
You've gone an arduous way.

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:39.533
Your friends must mean a lot to you.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:42.238
If you can jump down the pagoda...

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:45.345
to pick up the bead...

01:09:46.314 --> 01:09:48.180
then I will save them.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:06.061
I hope you'll keep your promise.

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:20.912
Did I ever go up there?

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:25.245
Everything is an illusion
in the mundane world.

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:28.321
Only your conviction is real.

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:32.283
The moment you decided
to sacrifice yourself...

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:35.256
the prayer bead was already in your hand.

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:43.429
Don't worry. I will save your friends.

01:10:47.042 --> 01:10:50.705
No one at the Gate is good enough
to beat Double Devils.

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:54.644
I know your relationship with Dragon.

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.078
He's good.

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:57.980
I wanna fight with him.

01:10:58.621 --> 01:10:59.986
Take this to save him.

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:02.783
He should die under my hands.

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:33.118
You'll be okay after the acupuncture.

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:39.626
Your internal power might even increase.

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.736
Don't move.

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.405
Don't say a word.

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:04.212
I was also adopted.

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:07.722
No one ever cares how I feel.

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:11.392
I did this for you today,

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:13.492
so you'll care for me.

01:12:16.065 --> 01:12:18.465
Even if you don't love me,

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:22.567
I can make you hate me!

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:50.160
This pill can only save one person.

01:12:50.399 --> 01:12:51.889
You can either save Dragon...

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.226
or yourself!

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.219
Dragon,

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.061
have you ever loved me?

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:23.644
Tiger, I'll teach you
"Electric Dragon Drill."

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:28.817
Turbo, I'll teach you "Golden Mask."

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:44.557
Tiger, Turbo,

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:47.098
I'm giving you two gadgets.

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:50.237
They can help you fight Shibumi.

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:52.268
But whether you'll win in the end

01:16:52.474 --> 01:16:54.499
depends on yourselves.

01:17:26.008 --> 01:17:27.475
Wait for me at the Gate.

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:32.538
I promise I'll be back.

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.830
Looking for your own death?

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:49.643
Your kung fu has improved a lot!

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.085
Let's have a good fight!

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:08.828
That's it?

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.795
Anything more?

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.294
Your "Golden Mask" is not bad!

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:48.493
Anything else?

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:25.794
"Electric Dragon Drill"! Embarrassing!

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:41.244
On behalf of the Gate,
I'm returning the plaque to you.

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:45.778
Dragon, I've been waiting for you!

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:01.025
"Eighteen Dragon Slaying Palms"?

01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:18.311
That's all you have, Shibumi? How slow!

01:28:49.757 --> 01:28:52.157
We can go back to the Gate now,

01:28:53.928 --> 01:28:55.418
Little Bro!

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:44.411
Tiger!

01:29:44.779 --> 01:29:45.803
Tiger is back!

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:46.672
Tiger!

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:47.905
Tiger!

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:50.015
Tiger!

01:29:57.058 --> 01:30:00.323
Uncle, we're back, my brother and me.

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:12.372
Uncle said the Gate...

01:30:12.573 --> 01:30:14.734
should be passed on to both of us.

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:17.711
Yo, what about me?

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:19.910
Ever think about changing

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:21.775
your name to Leopard?

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:25.412
Turbo Leopard? Sounds fierce!
