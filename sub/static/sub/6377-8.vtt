WEBVTT

00:11.762 --> 00:12.922
Sookie, are you okay?

00:13.431 --> 00:15.422
You want some water?

00:15.725 --> 00:17.431
Four?

00:17.602 --> 00:19.342
You're sure you found four bodies?

00:19.520 --> 00:23.889
-We shouldn't even be telling you this.
-Andy, not now. Not with me.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.728
There's four sets of remains
inside four coffins.

00:26.903 --> 00:29.110
-Oh, my God.
-We can't let you go in there.

00:29.280 --> 00:33.239
Andy, if you don't take your hands off me
right now, I swear to God, lwill kill you.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.274
Sweetheart, you don't wanna
come up here.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.990
Jiminy Christmas.

00:38.289 --> 00:40.701
-That's what happens to vampires?
-Evidently.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.533
Plus, we got three more.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.997
I hope you skipped breakfast.

00:46.172 --> 00:49.335
Sookie, did Bud send you up here
to make an ID? Because--

00:52.637 --> 00:53.968
Sookie, you okay?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.473
Bill Compton.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.986
To leave a voice message,
press one or just wait--

02:58.554 --> 03:00.294
Shit.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.592
Mama, it's not even 8.

03:06.771 --> 03:10.605
Good morning, baby. Did I wake you?
I'm almost done. Just a couple more loads.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.398
-Well, these are half full.
-Useless to me.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.434
Just fuel for demon fire.

03:15.613 --> 03:17.979
The bottle kept him alive for 40 years.

03:18.157 --> 03:22.446
As long as I keep the stuff out of my house,
he ain't never coming back.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.986
-Let's see how long you can keep it up.
-Forever.

03:25.164 --> 03:27.576
Gotta be. I'm down to my last chance.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.411
You didn't have a drink today?

03:29.585 --> 03:32.327
Didn't need one. Didn't even want one.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.795
-ls that maple syrup?
-Check the kitchen.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.343
I made hoecakes.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.809
Are you serious?

03:45.976 --> 03:49.343
-I haven't had hoecakes since--
-Since your grandmama was alive.

03:49.522 --> 03:51.934
| always could make them,
just never did.

03:52.108 --> 03:54.019
The demon never let me.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.990
-You made these with bacon grease.
-lt's the only way.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.161
You eat, baby girl.

04:11.335 --> 04:14.168
I got me some more devil juice
to take out.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.556
Goddamn.

04:28.144 --> 04:29.759
You....

04:30.688 --> 04:33.725
You are not like anybody I ever met.

04:33.899 --> 04:37.187
l was just gonna say the same thing.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.731
Jesus.

04:39.905 --> 04:43.113
It felt like
the whole world came together.

04:43.284 --> 04:48.074
Me, you, the bed, the house.
We were all one big giant--

04:48.247 --> 04:49.362
Organism.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.998
Yeah, mine was huge.

04:54.378 --> 04:58.212
I never knew vamp blood
could do something like this to you.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.088
You know what?

05:00.468 --> 05:02.550
Neither did I. I mean...

05:02.720 --> 05:06.338
...|'ve had V partners before,
but this was...

05:06.932 --> 05:09.389
...on a totally different planet.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.142
You're an extraordinary being.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.804
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

05:15.983 --> 05:19.396
I mean, in some ways, we barely know
each other, right? But you felt that.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.733
Tell me that that wasn't just me.
We tapped into each other.

05:22.907 --> 05:25.899
No, no, no, I felt it. We tapped.

05:26.076 --> 05:30.570
There's something old and good
and wise deep down in you.

05:30.748 --> 05:33.911
-l have to know that person.
-Come on, cut it out.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.791
Nobody who knows me
has ever called me wise.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.918
Then nobody really knows you.

05:43.928 --> 05:46.260
Are you blushing?

05:50.768 --> 05:52.929
I don't want you to go.

05:55.272 --> 05:58.355
Well, l was planning on
just burning through...

05:58.526 --> 06:00.938
...but if you have a place
for me to crash...

06:01.111 --> 06:03.773
...then for you,
I might just stick around...

06:03.948 --> 06:07.281
-...for a little bit.
-Stay. Stay with me.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.783
I don't wanna ever leave this bed.

06:09.954 --> 06:13.913
Let's just screw and do V
until we starve.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.159
Sure. Okay. But, I mean,
let's hold off on the screwing.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.703
I'm a respectable girl.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.291
What?

06:22.841 --> 06:23.967
Oh, did I hurt you?

06:24.677 --> 06:27.293
I'm sorry if I got carried away,
it was just so amazing.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.962
No, no. Jason, we didn't have sex.

06:32.142 --> 06:35.634
-What do you call what we been doing?
-We were together...

06:35.813 --> 06:39.476
...on V, deeper than I've ever felt
with anybody ever before.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.016
But physically, we barely touched.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.773
-No. No, that's not possible.
-I promise.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.983
Look. Panties still on.

06:53.956 --> 06:57.619
-What the fuck?
-I told you.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.205
It's better than sex.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.468
Jesus Christ,
what the hell are you doing?

07:10.639 --> 07:13.881
Stop with the J.C.
I'm cleaning, what does it look like?

07:14.059 --> 07:17.472
-Watch your feet. I just waxed.
-I hope you mean the floor.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.063
Can I help you?

07:21.233 --> 07:23.315
I'm up to my elbows in Easy-Off.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.644
-My mama made me hoecakes this morning.
-So?

07:26.822 --> 07:28.232
She cooked me breakfast.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.898
When's the last time you saw
my mama lift a finger...

07:31.076 --> 07:33.658
...for anything besides Mad Dog 20/20?

07:33.829 --> 07:37.196
We went into the woods to get
a $445 hoodoo exorcism last night.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.366
-You do not wanna get me started on that.
-My grandmother's dead.

07:40.544 --> 07:44.207
At least you got someone.
You ever think about what's happening...

07:44.381 --> 07:47.794
-...with others before you barge in on them?
-Sorry. I didn't me--

07:47.968 --> 07:49.833
Oh, my God, are those fang marks?

07:50.012 --> 07:53.300
So what? It means someone cared for me
when everyone else left me.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.886
No wonder you're crazy.
A vampire made a meal of you.

07:56.060 --> 07:59.143
Why am | the only person that
doesn't think vampires are monsters?

07:59.313 --> 08:03.226
They drink our blood. What's to say Bill
won't leave you once he's had his fill?

08:03.400 --> 08:06.733
Do you have any idea what I've been
through today? A friend would ask.

08:06.904 --> 08:10.021
Don't tell me how to be your friend.
I'm the only one you got, goddamn--

08:10.199 --> 08:11.735
-Lord's name in vain.
-Fuck off.

08:11.909 --> 08:14.776
Get out of my house!
I've gotten very good at losing people.

08:14.953 --> 08:18.411
-You are only making it easier for me.
-Bitch, I don't even wanna be here.

08:18.582 --> 08:22.245
If you are hell-bent on being alone
in this world, I ain't gonna stop you.

08:34.098 --> 08:35.588
Oh, man.

08:35.766 --> 08:39.600
I wanna not have sex with you again
so bad, you don't even know.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.477
I think I got some idea.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.106
But that V that we did
was the last I had.

08:47.236 --> 08:50.273
-Where do we score some more?
-When we need more, we'll go get it.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.318
Don't be greedy.
We'll be okay for a while.

08:54.493 --> 08:57.530
-Just eat your breakfast.
-You sure you don't want some?

08:57.705 --> 09:00.947
-Pepperoni and sausage.
-No, thank you. I only eat organic.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.413
The cleaner my body is,
the more intensely I feel the V.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.621
Why do you have two televisions
in the same room?

09:08.799 --> 09:12.792
The bottom one's busted.
I just keep it because it was my parents'.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.264
Can I ask you how they died?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.931
Yeah...

09:20.436 --> 09:23.428
-...I don't like to talk about it.
-Okay.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.731
It was a flash flood.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.018
They were caught on the bridge
by the Parish Road...

09:31.196 --> 09:32.811
...and got swept out in the river.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.321
My little sister and I...

09:35.492 --> 09:38.325
...were staying at our gran's
while they went out.

09:38.495 --> 09:42.454
They didn't think I could look after Sookie
by myself, even though I was almost 11.

09:47.379 --> 09:51.088
Sometimes I think, if I was a better kid...

09:51.258 --> 09:53.920
...they wouldn't have
had to drop us off at Gran's.

09:54.094 --> 09:58.508
Then they wouldn't have been
on the bridge at the exact point when....

10:01.351 --> 10:05.344
-So your grandma raised you after that?
-Yeah, I moved back here...

10:06.023 --> 10:11.108
...when I was 18, even though Gran
would have rather kept an eye on me.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.568
Yeah, she passed too.

10:13.739 --> 10:17.072
-Last week.
-Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

10:17.242 --> 10:19.153
Goddamn.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.197
I don't mean to be spilling.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.113
-I never do this.
-You never talk about things...

10:24.291 --> 10:26.828
...with anybody?
You don't talk to your sister?

10:27.002 --> 10:28.958
Least of all her.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.630
She brings out the worst in me.

10:30.798 --> 10:35.167
We had this big fight after Gran died
and I hit her.

10:35.344 --> 10:37.084
Itell you...

10:38.013 --> 10:40.004
...I am...

10:40.265 --> 10:42.802
...the worst brother in the world.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.646
That's ridiculous.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.100
I've seen who you are inside.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.310
I've been there.

10:53.070 --> 10:56.233
-And you're good, Jason.
-No.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.899
Do you hear me?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.920
She's a beauty.
You want it for your office?

11:22.099 --> 11:23.214
No.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.553
We'll put it over the bar.

11:26.228 --> 11:30.597
-Drunks like talking to the animals.
-Hey, check it out.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.560
Possum prick.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.146
-Where'd you get that?
-Shot one last week.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.983
Was gonna stuff it but I left it out.
It got to raining and three days later...

11:39.157 --> 11:41.694
...ain't nothing left
but possum sludge and bones.

11:41.869 --> 11:45.032
I saved this, though.
Possums have a two-pronged penis.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.617
-It's supposed to bring good luck.
-Yeah.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.624
Hey, Terry,
let's keep that story between us.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.501
The girls might get the wrong idea.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.875
Hey, Sam.

12:00.846 --> 12:03.178
What was you doing out this morning?

12:03.432 --> 12:05.093
-Why?
-You wouldn't have been...

12:05.267 --> 12:08.634
...running through the woods
without no clothes on, would you?

12:08.812 --> 12:11.349
-Why would I do that?
-I don't know.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.263
That's why I'm asking.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.433
I was out fishing
and I could have swore...

12:15.611 --> 12:19.320
...I saw you blazing buck-naked
through the trees.

12:20.824 --> 12:25.864
No, it wasn't me.
I was working on my car.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.495
It looked an awful lot like you.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.832
Except you wear clothes.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.790
I don't know.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.042
Maybe I'm seeing things again.

12:42.220 --> 12:46.338
Except usually when I see people
who ain't there, it's-- It's--

12:46.516 --> 12:48.472
-It's the insurgents.
-Yeah.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.353
Yeah.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.136
Only this fella I saw,
he didn't look like no insurgent.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.772
But you said
he was running, though, huh?

12:56.860 --> 13:00.694
Plenty of cover in the trees.
How could you tell for sure?

13:01.073 --> 13:02.984
Hey, I believe you saw what you saw.

13:03.158 --> 13:06.195
I just don't know why anyone would
run naked through the woods...

13:06.370 --> 13:08.907
-...in broad daylight.
-Yeah.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.197
Maybe you're right.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.615
ShooL

13:15.087 --> 13:17.829
I hate being this way, Sam.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.671
It's all right, buddy.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.422
Come on.

13:22.386 --> 13:25.128
We're a long way from Fallujah.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.739
SooMe.

16:20.564 --> 16:22.555
No, not the neck.

16:35.287 --> 16:37.903
Where the hell is Sookie today?

16:42.544 --> 16:44.785
Here you go, honey.
Sorry it took so long.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.249
Intense.

16:47.424 --> 16:51.417
All these animals on the wall,
it's like a natural history museum.

16:51.887 --> 16:54.594
-I never noticed them.
-How could you not?

16:54.764 --> 16:59.508
Every one of these animals lived a life full
of experiences that we can't even imagine.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.927
Does it weird you out?
We could go someplace else.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.972
No. I mean, everyone has to eat, right?

17:05.150 --> 17:08.813
We're all links
on the universal food chain.

17:08.987 --> 17:13.447
See? Squirrel eats nuts, snake eats
the squirrel, gator eats the snake.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.567
And we can eat pretty much
anything we want.

17:16.745 --> 17:18.281
It's the circle of life.

17:18.455 --> 17:20.696
Jesus Christ. I wanna lick your mind.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.160
Let's have lunch first.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.253
Order up.

17:30.675 --> 17:34.884
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know I'm late.
-Sookie, listen, I heard about the fire.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.047
-I'm real, real sorry. How you holding up?
-He's alive.

17:39.351 --> 17:40.466
-What?
-Bi||.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.135
They said four bodies.
I thought Bill was one of them.

17:43.313 --> 17:46.476
-He wasn't?
-No, he's fine. In fact...

17:46.650 --> 17:47.730
...he's wonderful.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.396
That must be quite a relief for you.

17:50.570 --> 17:55.314
You have no idea. Anyways,
no need to worry about me. I'm great.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.656
Sweetie, where you been?
I'm up to my eyeballs in tickets.

18:00.830 --> 18:04.288
Arlene, you look so beautiful today.

18:04.834 --> 18:08.793
I love you,
even if you are a bigot sometimes.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.044
-What's with her?
-Bill's alive.

18:13.218 --> 18:16.506
-What? But I thought--
-I know. So did I.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.840
Order up.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.005
I'm coming. Hold your horses.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.846
He got my message that something bad
might be brewing, so he spent the night...

18:24.020 --> 18:25.976
-...in the graveyard.
-Doesn't it get cold?

18:26.147 --> 18:27.683
No, he was in the ground.

18:27.857 --> 18:31.145
So after I couldn't find him,
then hearing about those four bodies...

18:31.319 --> 18:35.107
...at that burnt-up house, you can imagine
what I was going through.

18:35.282 --> 18:38.524
-I mean, that must have been terrible.
-Oh, you don't know.

18:38.702 --> 18:42.160
They said there was only three vampires
that come in here the other night.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.367
-Who's the fourth body?
-Some poor fangbanger, they're saying now.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.659
Some vampires like to
keep a human around for sex...

18:48.837 --> 18:50.418
...and blood.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.339
I'll get your Cokes.

18:57.595 --> 19:00.211
-Thought you said "order up."
-I did. New girl took them.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.971
New girl?

19:02.726 --> 19:06.719
BLT, cheeseburger, well-done,
fried egg on white, hot wings...

19:06.896 --> 19:08.682
...smoked sausage...

19:09.190 --> 19:10.896
...tuna melt...

19:11.067 --> 19:14.309
...and the chicken fried steak
must be for you.

19:14.487 --> 19:18.901
-Thank you. We've got a four-top open.
-Isn't she something?

19:19.534 --> 19:23.903
-She's with you.
-I know you're pissed at me but...

19:24.539 --> 19:27.030
...I really want you to like her.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.458
Sorry about that.
You looked really swamped...

19:30.628 --> 19:33.290
...and the natives
were getting restless so....

19:33.465 --> 19:37.128
You're Jason's sister, right? It's--
I've heard so much about you.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.088
-Who are you?
-My name's Amy.

19:39.262 --> 19:41.048
-Amy Burley. I'm with Jason.
-With me.

19:41.222 --> 19:45.135
And you must be Arlene with the beautiful
red hair. It's so nice to meet you.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.050
How'd you know all the table numbers?

19:47.228 --> 19:50.061
Well, I waited tables in college
so I just assumed clockwise.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.018
You know, Table 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

19:53.193 --> 19:57.482
And I think the guys at Table 5 like you
because they left you a really nice tip.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.863
Sam, I think we might have found
a replacement for Dawn.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.615
Looks like you did too.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.999
What?

20:17.217 --> 20:20.550
Don't you touch that, sweetie pie.
Mama'll take care of all the laundry.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.133
Oh, my goodness. Lettie Mae,
ain't she the spitting image of you.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.763
That's a compliment.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.175
Tara Mae, you remember
Mable Simpkins, don't you?

20:28.353 --> 20:30.139
-Yeah, from the church.
-That's right.

20:30.313 --> 20:32.975
And why don't we see
your smiling face there no more?

20:33.149 --> 20:37.017
-Because I stopped going.
-Oh, well, it's never too late to come back.

20:37.195 --> 20:40.437
Lettie Mae left us for two years
and we welcomed her back today...

20:40.615 --> 20:42.776
-...|ike she had never gone.
-I heard the call.

20:42.951 --> 20:47.194
The good Lord said, "Lettie Mae, you been
away too long. Your church needs you."

20:47.372 --> 20:48.987
You should have heard her testify.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.577
The entire congregation
was filled with the spirit.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.619
-Yeah, I bet she was full of it.
-Your mama's an inspiration to us all.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.412
-Glory to God.
-Amen.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.507
Girl, why don't you come
to Bible group on Tuesday?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.714
Got plenty of nice young men
and fruit punch.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.300
A little religion do you
a world of good, baby girl.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.806
Shit. Are you even listening
to what you're saying?

21:08.977 --> 21:12.014
You can lie to yourself and everyone else
but when you go to bed...

21:12.188 --> 21:14.520
...you are just as fucked up
and miserable as I am.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.023
And going to church
and wearing a crazy-ass hat...

21:17.193 --> 21:19.024
...ain't gonna make you a better person.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.653
She got a demon in her.

21:22.824 --> 21:25.031
My granddaughter had a demon in her.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.192
They everywhere.

21:27.370 --> 21:31.113
No, sure, I understand.
No, it's no problem.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.498
Okay, baby. Bye-bye.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.708
Every time I get a night off,
my babysitter falls through on me.

21:39.340 --> 21:43.424
You know, I like kids, Arlene.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.714
Doughnuts too.

21:46.890 --> 21:51.509
Maybe if you brought a lady friend along.
Lisa likes a female in the house.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.893
I ain't had a lady friend
since I come home.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.184
Well, that's some bad luck for you,
Iguess.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.059
Did something happen there...

22:01.237 --> 22:04.400
...that you been keeping to yourself?

22:09.037 --> 22:13.326
No, I'd just as soon sit here
and listen at you.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.706
I like your voice.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.700
And your clavicles.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.714
I've been admiring your necklace all day.

22:23.885 --> 22:27.719
Oh, thanks, it's a Iariat. I made it.

22:28.389 --> 22:30.425
You make jewelry?

22:30.600 --> 22:35.060
It's a easy way to earn extra money.
I can make you one, if you want.

22:35.939 --> 22:40.603
Thanks, but I don't think my boyfriend
much likes silver.

22:42.946 --> 22:46.609
-You know my brother's a dog, don't you?
-I'm sorry?

22:46.783 --> 22:51.322
He's all charm and smiles in the beginning,
but the second he gets tired of you...

22:51.496 --> 22:53.111
...he's gonna stop calling.

22:53.289 --> 22:56.406
Before you know it,
he's off with some other floozy.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.671
Not-- Not that you are one.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.966
But trust me,
it's as regular as the seasons.

23:04.133 --> 23:07.261
You seem like a sweet girl.
I don't want you to get hurt.

23:09.305 --> 23:14.971
You know, I don't think Jason's realized
even half of what he's going to be.

23:15.853 --> 23:20.313
I wouldn't be so quick to judge. I think you
might be surprised at what he's capable of.

23:26.406 --> 23:30.149
-Hey, Sookie, I been meaning to talk to you.
-What's the matter?

23:30.326 --> 23:34.820
I've just been a mess lately. You know,
with the kids and the double shifts...

23:34.998 --> 23:38.286
...and Rene and everything,
it's been awful hard.

23:38.459 --> 23:43.999
And I've probably said some things that
I don't mean, but that's the pressure talking.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.505
I love you like my own sister.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.007
And you know that, right?

23:49.178 --> 23:51.464
I appreciate that. Thank you.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.636
And sure, I'll babysit your kids tonight.

23:56.978 --> 23:59.344
-I didn't-- I mean--
-I heard you talking to Terry.

23:59.522 --> 24:01.729
I'm a better choice.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.440
We'll drop them off at 8.

24:05.194 --> 24:09.312
Rene's taking me to Ruston
to see that Oak Ridge Boys tribute band.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.651
Fun.

24:24.422 --> 24:27.414
You look mighty pretty tonight, Tara.
That's a nice color on you.

24:27.592 --> 24:30.004
-Fuck you.
-I'm sorry, w--

24:30.178 --> 24:31.793
Was that sexist?

24:31.971 --> 24:34.212
Tara, may I have a word with you?

24:34.891 --> 24:36.381
In my office.

24:40.980 --> 24:44.939
Hey, I get it. You said yourself hiring me
might not work out. I piss people off.

24:45.109 --> 24:46.519
If you wanna fire me, fire me.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.309
-I totally understand.
-No.

24:48.488 --> 24:51.901
You and I are the only ones who get it.

24:52.992 --> 24:56.109
It's everybody else
who's fucking themselves up.

25:08.466 --> 25:11.082
Doesn't it get old for you?

25:11.260 --> 25:14.878
I mean, you've been doing it
for over a hundred years.

25:15.056 --> 25:17.388
Doesn't it get predictable?

25:17.892 --> 25:20.008
Not with you, it doesn't.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.974
You're entirely different.

25:24.941 --> 25:28.934
And the beauty
and the tragedy of it is....

25:29.362 --> 25:32.900
Is that you don't know
just how different you are.

25:34.575 --> 25:38.284
Please tell me if
I'm doing something wrong.

25:39.330 --> 25:43.198
There's nothing more natural
than the act of making love.

25:44.794 --> 25:47.706
Who am I to try to change
what comes naturally to you?

25:47.880 --> 25:50.713
But if you could change something--

25:51.342 --> 25:53.503
I wouldn't change a thing.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.474
What's it like to sleep in the ground?

26:10.570 --> 26:13.357
Well, it's not exactly comfortable.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.402
But it is safe.

26:18.661 --> 26:23.451
Which, ifl recall, is what the three
voice mails required of me that night.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.034
Oh, crap.

26:28.212 --> 26:31.329
Arlene. I forgot, I told her
I'd babysit the kids.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.168
Shango?

26:35.344 --> 26:39.087
Stay. It'll be good for her.
You can put some pants on, though.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.437
-Hi.
-SooMe.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.523
What's wrong? What took you so long?

26:54.697 --> 26:58.030
-I was out back in the yard.
-In your nightie?

26:58.201 --> 27:00.863
The cat got out.
Made friends with a squirrel.

27:01.037 --> 27:03.699
-Mommy, look, it's a vampire.
-Sookie...

27:03.873 --> 27:06.034
...you didn't mention
that you had company.

27:06.209 --> 27:07.574
I didn't think I had to.

27:07.752 --> 27:11.040
Well, I got a right to know
who's looking after my children.

27:11.214 --> 27:13.796
Well, here we are.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.797
Is there a problem?

27:17.512 --> 27:19.093
Take it easy, chere.

27:19.263 --> 27:22.300
Mr. Compton's raised a couple
of them little ones himself, yeah?

27:22.725 --> 27:24.681
That's quite right.

27:27.355 --> 27:32.520
Keep these on you, you hear? And....

27:32.985 --> 27:35.067
And stay close to your Aunt Sookie.

27:35.238 --> 27:37.399
They'll be fine, I promise.

27:37.573 --> 27:38.824
-Who wants pizza?
-Me.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.243
-Me.
-Good, because that's what we're having.

27:41.410 --> 27:42.490
You can eat pizza?

27:42.662 --> 27:47.076
Well, unfortunately, no,
but I understand it's delicious.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.456
You know what's good about sex
that people never mention?

27:52.797 --> 27:58.133
For anywhere between five minutes to an
hour, you forget your own fucked-up life.

27:58.302 --> 27:59.337
Only if it's good.

28:00.263 --> 28:03.096
If it's not, it reminds you
just how bad your life really is.

28:03.266 --> 28:08.010
-Then I guess you're pretty good.
-Thanks, you're not bad yourself.

28:09.814 --> 28:11.270
Easy on the praise, honey.

28:13.985 --> 28:15.646
What?

28:15.862 --> 28:17.443
No, you're good.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.399
-But?
-Nothing.

28:19.574 --> 28:21.781
It's good. You're good.

28:21.951 --> 28:24.909
-What am I doing wrong?
-Nothing.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.292
-It's so minor, it doesn't even matter.
-Sam. What is it?

28:30.459 --> 28:32.074
-Don't do this to me.
-Spit it out.

28:33.004 --> 28:34.960
Sometimes...

28:35.840 --> 28:37.580
...you grunt.

28:37.758 --> 28:40.374
-| what?
-It's natural. Nothing to get worked up over.

28:40.553 --> 28:43.841
-It's just a sound.
-A grunting sound? Like a farm animal?

28:44.015 --> 28:48.554
No. No, it's-- It's--
It's athletic. Like tennis players...

28:48.728 --> 28:50.719
-...when they serve.
-You mean like Serena?

28:52.648 --> 28:55.264
What, because I'm black,
I sound like Serena Williams?

28:55.443 --> 28:58.480
-That's not what I said.
-You racist son of a bitch.

28:58.988 --> 29:01.104
How can I be racist?
I just had sex with you.

29:01.282 --> 29:04.615
You asshole. Why'd you have to go
and take the only good 10 minutes...

29:04.785 --> 29:08.152
...of my entire day and ruin it like that?

29:08.331 --> 29:12.165
-Well, I think it was more than 10 minutes.
-Oh, fuck you. Fuck you all.

29:12.335 --> 29:16.169
-All who?
-Everybody. Fuck everybody!

29:21.218 --> 29:22.628
-Whipped cream.
-Yeah.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.543
-Me too.
-I hope you can finish this...

29:24.722 --> 29:26.838
-...before your mother comes back.
-No problem.

29:27.016 --> 29:30.474
-I ate a whole jar of mayonnaise once.
-I had to watch.

29:30.645 --> 29:32.510
Bill, how come you can't have ice cream?

29:32.688 --> 29:35.851
You might say that I'm lactose intolerant.

29:36.025 --> 29:39.859
Just like my Aunt Fern.
Except she don't tolerate Mexicans.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.522
Aunt Sookie, is Bill your boyfriend?

29:43.699 --> 29:46.987
Bill, would you say
that you're my boyfriend?

29:47.161 --> 29:50.699
Well, I suppose I'd have to ask permission
from Coby and Lisa.

29:50.873 --> 29:53.455
Would it be all right
if I was Aunt Sookie's boyfriend?

29:53.626 --> 29:54.786
Do you buy her flowers?

29:55.670 --> 29:57.206
Why, no, I haven't yet.

29:57.380 --> 30:00.167
You better. Rene buys flowers
for Mama all the time.

30:00.341 --> 30:03.549
-Then I will have to mend my ways.
-You do that. Then we'll talk.

30:04.804 --> 30:06.214
Can we see your fangs?

30:06.389 --> 30:09.472
-Oh, I don't think that's gonna be possible.
-Why, certainly.

30:20.653 --> 30:22.518
I think we got a flat tire.

30:24.824 --> 30:28.316
I don't wanna leave them with that vampire
one second longer than I have to.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.736
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm getting to it, woman.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.039
-Baby.
-What?

30:39.213 --> 30:40.828
Pass me that Maglite, will you?

30:54.228 --> 30:55.764
Crap, it's burnt out.

30:56.731 --> 30:57.766
Are you sure?

30:58.566 --> 31:02.354
You better check it.
I just put some fresh batteries in there.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.487
Arlene Fowler...

31:16.375 --> 31:18.616
...would you do me the honor...

31:18.878 --> 31:20.288
...of being my wife?

31:31.932 --> 31:35.595
Why didn't you say anything
at the Red Lobster?

31:36.604 --> 31:39.391
I know I've done it four other times,
but it never gets old.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.898
Oh, I'm so thrilled for you two.

31:43.069 --> 31:46.277
-Would you be a bridesmaid for me again?
-Why, of course.

31:46.447 --> 31:51.817
-You hardly have to ask.
-Oh, honey, I love you so much.

31:53.329 --> 31:54.819
Maybe you two are next, huh?

31:57.666 --> 31:59.497
Well, I mean, when it becomes legal.

32:02.963 --> 32:04.248
Mommy, what's going on?

32:05.132 --> 32:06.668
Sweetie...

32:06.842 --> 32:09.219
...you're gonna be my flower girl.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.600
Morning, dear.

32:19.355 --> 32:20.970
Bill.

32:21.148 --> 32:22.479
Did you make all this?

32:22.650 --> 32:25.733
I borrowed some of
your grandmother's old recipes.

32:25.903 --> 32:27.894
But the handiwork is all mine.

32:28.072 --> 32:30.108
I don't even know where to begin.

32:30.282 --> 32:34.321
Well, I would start with the biscuits.
They just came out of the oven.

32:37.164 --> 32:40.702
-Gonna be clear skies all day.
-Wait, Bill, it's light out.

32:43.629 --> 32:46.917
Yes, I suppose it is.

32:54.557 --> 32:56.047
Yeah.

32:56.433 --> 32:58.094
Yeah, okay.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.597
No. No, I'll make the call.

33:01.772 --> 33:05.890
His mama passed a couple years back,
but he had some family in Kentucky.

33:06.068 --> 33:08.059
His dentist confirmed the match
a bit ago.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.148
I thought you should be
the first to know.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.283
Goddang it.

33:13.450 --> 33:15.236
Why Neil?

33:15.411 --> 33:17.276
He was such a quiet kid.

33:17.454 --> 33:20.446
I'd have never thought
he'd get mixed up with fangers.

33:21.667 --> 33:22.907
Damn.

33:23.085 --> 33:26.168
To have nothing left of you to ID
but teeth.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.250
You wanna maybe let one of
the homes in Monroe handle him?

33:33.053 --> 33:34.509
No.

33:34.930 --> 33:38.388
No. He worked for me.
I owe it to him.

33:38.851 --> 33:41.593
Give me a couple hours,
I'll come over and claim him, okay?

33:41.770 --> 33:43.271
Okay. Thanks, Mike.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.274
Yeah.

33:52.281 --> 33:54.772
-Pretty tore up?
-BIind-sided him.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.942
Had no idea Neil was a fangbanger.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.611
Jesus, Bud, the kid was creepy.

34:00.789 --> 34:03.917
What 19-year-old goes to work
for a funeral home?

34:04.084 --> 34:06.871
I worked in a slaughterhouse
when I was 15.

34:07.046 --> 34:09.662
They made me clean chitlins.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.632
Speaking of freaks....

34:21.685 --> 34:22.970
And that's it.

34:23.145 --> 34:26.057
I got no control over
what people do after they leave the bar.

34:26.232 --> 34:30.851
You remember anyone being unusually angry
over what those vampires did to your bar?

34:31.028 --> 34:32.814
Yeah, everyone. We were all angry.

34:32.988 --> 34:35.695
Heck, you might as well
interrogate the whole town.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.273
Between you and me...

34:38.452 --> 34:42.616
...I wouldn't be heartbroken if you didn't
find who did it. You know what I'm saying?

34:42.790 --> 34:46.749
Old Mrs. Stackhouse, on the other hand,
now that's a real tragedy.

34:46.919 --> 34:50.958
Her and Dawn and Maudette Pickens,
one right after the other.

34:51.131 --> 34:53.508
You fellas got any leads on that?

34:54.260 --> 34:56.376
We're working on some right now.

34:56.553 --> 34:59.044
Good. I'm pulling for you guys.

34:59.765 --> 35:00.800
Okay.

35:01.809 --> 35:04.801
You remember anything else,
we'll be having a burger inside.

35:05.229 --> 35:06.890
Come on, Andy.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.601
Hey, Sam.

35:16.365 --> 35:18.822
One other thing.

35:19.034 --> 35:23.198
You recall spending any time
out in the woods lately?

35:24.123 --> 35:25.613
Yeah.

35:25.874 --> 35:27.489
Some.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.867
But you knew that already, didn't you?

35:32.923 --> 35:33.958
Andy.

35:35.884 --> 35:37.044
|f....

35:37.219 --> 35:41.007
If I tell you,
you have to keep this a secret.

35:42.057 --> 35:44.764
Nobody in town knows.

35:44.935 --> 35:49.895
But I come from a family of naturists.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.054
Like bird watchers?

35:51.233 --> 35:54.691
No. No, not naturalists. Naturists.

35:54.862 --> 35:57.649
Naturists believe in a freer...

35:57.823 --> 36:00.405
...clothing-optional kind of lifestyle.

36:01.201 --> 36:05.911
-You're a nudist?
-No, no. Good Lord, no.

36:06.415 --> 36:07.825
But my folks were...

36:08.000 --> 36:09.911
...I'm embarrassed to say.

36:10.085 --> 36:13.293
They spent most of their lives
at a nudist colony.

36:13.464 --> 36:15.420
Oh, yeah? Around here?

36:16.383 --> 36:18.840
No, in Texas, just outside Beaumont.

36:22.765 --> 36:26.883
Ever since they passed,
I honor their memory once a year by...

36:27.061 --> 36:30.599
...taking a run through the woods
the way they used to. It's--

36:30.773 --> 36:32.889
It's my private way of mourning.

36:33.067 --> 36:35.604
I'm sorry if anybody had to see it.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.365
What?

36:47.623 --> 36:50.285
Hooker, you done got took.

36:50.459 --> 36:52.370
That wasn't no damn exorcism...

36:52.544 --> 36:54.125
...that was a straight-up con job.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.957
You know what
the fucked-up thing is?

36:56.131 --> 36:57.746
-What?
-It worked.

36:57.925 --> 37:00.712
It was like aliens beamed down
and switched out her brain.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.343
Then that was 445 well-spent.

37:03.514 --> 37:06.221
Shit. Happy dance.

37:06.392 --> 37:08.348
You should be glad to be rid of that....

37:08.519 --> 37:10.931
-That's your mama. I ain't gonna say it.
-Fuck that.

37:13.982 --> 37:16.644
...some hoodoo woman moves some rocks
around on your belly.

37:16.819 --> 37:18.901
I thought you said it worked.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.732
I thought you said it was a con job.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.319
Heifer, it's not a con job
if you got your money's worth.

37:24.493 --> 37:27.360
Hell. And who knows?

37:27.538 --> 37:29.119
It might do you some good too.

37:29.289 --> 37:32.156
I don't have another 445
to waste on bullshit.

37:32.334 --> 37:35.622
You just saying that
because you don't understand it.

37:35.796 --> 37:41.257
And trust me, this world is filled
with things we will never understand.

37:42.010 --> 37:46.219
Compared to a lifetime of Zoloft,
445's a bargain.

37:52.229 --> 37:53.389
Hey, what you doing?

37:53.564 --> 37:54.599
Vitamin.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.809
I've never seen you
take a vitamin before.

37:57.484 --> 38:01.022
So what? You've never seen me
put on deodorant or wash my hair...

38:01.196 --> 38:04.563
...or feed my cat, have you?
But I do all those things.

38:04.741 --> 38:07.574
I don't need a permission slip from you.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.048
Christ.

38:31.727 --> 38:33.263
Good day?

38:35.105 --> 38:36.140
I need V.

38:37.524 --> 38:38.809
What?

38:38.984 --> 38:41.691
I thought you said
you didn't need any again until...

38:41.862 --> 38:44.820
-...you needed it again.
-Well, I need it. Okay?

38:45.532 --> 38:46.942
Okay.

38:48.577 --> 38:50.363
Look me in the eye.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.744
Tell me that you don't want it too.

38:52.998 --> 38:57.492
Yeah, of course I do,
but Lafayette won't sell it to me.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.872
I texted you three times.

39:41.129 --> 39:45.668
-Why didn't you reply?
-I hate using the number keys to type.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.508
What are you listening to?

39:48.679 --> 39:51.136
From my younger days.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.969
It's really quite beautiful
if you know Old Swedish.

39:56.937 --> 39:58.598
I have a favor to ask of you.

39:59.565 --> 40:01.601
A favor or an order?

40:04.319 --> 40:06.435
Depends on how you look at it.

40:09.324 --> 40:13.408
Honestly, did you think
you could keep her to yourself?

40:19.001 --> 40:21.583
It feels a little like stalking, don't it?

40:24.631 --> 40:27.122
It's the most natural thing in the world.

40:27.301 --> 40:28.837
The hunt.

40:29.011 --> 40:32.754
People used to do this all the time before
we got complacent with cloned beef...

40:32.931 --> 40:35.013
...and prepackaged dinners.

40:57.706 --> 40:58.991
Headlights off.

40:59.166 --> 41:01.498
-You done this before?
-Stay five lengths behind...

41:01.668 --> 41:03.829
...10 if we get on the Parish Road.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.193
Well, hey there, sweetness.

41:34.368 --> 41:35.733
You ready to party?

41:38.246 --> 41:41.704
I'll take that as a yes. Nasty.

42:01.603 --> 42:03.594
I bought this specially for you.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.096
I remember you said...

42:06.274 --> 42:08.356
...you go for merlot.

42:08.527 --> 42:10.267
I said I worked at Merlotte's.

42:10.904 --> 42:13.190
But whatever. Pour me some anyhow.

42:48.024 --> 42:51.608
All right, baby. Eddie juice first.

42:51.778 --> 42:53.734
Then we play.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.965
There it is.

43:30.817 --> 43:33.775
I always look fonNard to Monday nights.

43:33.945 --> 43:36.277
First Heroes, then...

43:36.531 --> 43:37.520
...you.

43:38.950 --> 43:43.819
Eddie, what fun is it being a vampire
if all you do is watch TV?

43:44.122 --> 43:46.033
Well, I like TV.

43:47.584 --> 43:51.827
I'm just saying you should try the bars.
I know you like getting laid too.

43:52.005 --> 43:54.462
Why should I go to the bars?

43:54.633 --> 43:55.998
I got this.

44:03.892 --> 44:06.474
You like me, don't you, Lafayette?

44:10.273 --> 44:12.355
Sure, I like you.

44:14.194 --> 44:15.809
I mean...

44:16.947 --> 44:22.408
...even if I wasn't helping out with
the blood, you'd still want me, right?

44:23.036 --> 44:25.072
Why you even got to ask me that?

44:27.290 --> 44:31.203
I'd hate to think it's just business for you
when you come over.

44:31.378 --> 44:33.243
Of course not.

44:33.421 --> 44:36.584
What, you think I fool around
with all my business associates?

44:38.635 --> 44:40.546
There we go.

44:47.853 --> 44:51.721
Now show me what
a dirty old vampire you is.

45:16.089 --> 45:18.705
I want you so bad...

45:19.134 --> 45:21.341
.ulache.

45:28.018 --> 45:30.054
Well, come on, baby.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.852
I'll take care of you.

45:40.113 --> 45:42.104
You said you wanted to go out tonight.

45:42.282 --> 45:44.398
I did not mean Fangtasia.

45:44.576 --> 45:48.990
I mean, really, all those pathetic people who
come here looking for sex with vampires.

45:49.164 --> 45:50.995
I know. It's despicable.

45:51.499 --> 45:53.330
You know what I mean.

45:53.501 --> 45:55.708
So, what, five, 10 minutes?

45:55.879 --> 45:57.915
As long as Eric requires us.

45:58.089 --> 46:00.501
You mean as long as he requires me.

46:00.675 --> 46:03.007
Didn't even have the decency
to ask me himself.

46:03.178 --> 46:06.011
You are mine.
He didn't need to ask your permission.

46:06.181 --> 46:08.172
He cannot check me out
like a library book.

46:08.350 --> 46:10.181
Unfortunately, Sookie, he can.

46:10.352 --> 46:13.059
-Eric is sheriff of Area 5.
-Sheriff?

46:13.229 --> 46:15.356
It's a position of great power
among our kind.

46:15.523 --> 46:17.434
We do not wanna anger him.

46:17.609 --> 46:21.978
As long as the requests are reasonable,
we should accede to his wishes.

46:41.716 --> 46:44.924
I had this crazy dream this morning.

46:45.095 --> 46:47.837
We were sitting, eating breakfast...

46:48.014 --> 46:51.222
...and all of a sudden
the sunlight set you on fire.

46:56.523 --> 46:59.310
It wouldn't happen quite that way.

47:01.236 --> 47:06.776
The sunlight would severely weaken me
and eventually, of course, I would die.

47:07.617 --> 47:09.232
But I wouldn't burst into flames.

47:13.081 --> 47:14.821
Not right away, at least.

47:17.085 --> 47:21.749
So I guess we'll never
have breakfast together.

47:43.778 --> 47:45.939
I knew you'd come.

47:47.615 --> 47:49.025
Let's go inside.

47:53.955 --> 47:55.616
No, I'm quite certain.

47:55.790 --> 47:57.781
We keep extensive records here.

47:57.959 --> 48:01.793
All the way back to 1958.

48:01.963 --> 48:04.124
Never had anybody by the name
of Merlotte here.

48:04.299 --> 48:06.961
And you're sure you're
the only nudist colony in the area?

48:07.135 --> 48:08.420
Naturist community.

48:08.595 --> 48:10.210
We 're the ﬁrst, ﬁnest and only...

48:10.388 --> 48:13.050
...clothing-optional sanctuary
in all of Jefferson County.

48:13.224 --> 48:15.806
All right. Thanks very much.

48:15.977 --> 48:17.558
You come visit us, you hear?

48:17.729 --> 48:18.969
Got a barbecue every month.

48:24.736 --> 48:28.649
Pam, Longshadow and I
are partners in this club.

48:28.823 --> 48:33.817
And we recently noticed that $60,000
has gone missing from our books.

48:34.746 --> 48:36.737
And Bruce...

48:38.166 --> 48:41.408
...is our accountant. Perhaps
you can start by listening to him.

48:41.586 --> 48:43.918
-He's not saying anything.
-Don't be coy.

48:45.590 --> 48:49.048
It's humbling enough
to turn to a human for assistance.

48:50.929 --> 48:54.262
-We know what you can do.
-And I know what you can do too.

48:54.432 --> 48:57.765
-Why don't you just glamour him?
-Don't you think we tried everything...

48:57.936 --> 48:59.801
...before summoning you?

49:00.522 --> 49:04.640
So it would be a great favor to me...

49:05.318 --> 49:07.434
...and to Mr. Compton if you help us.

49:09.906 --> 49:12.522
If I find out who did it, then what?

49:12.700 --> 49:16.818
We'll turn that person over to the police
and let the authorities handle it from there.

49:16.996 --> 49:21.786
Hundreds of years old and
you're still a terrible liar. Come on.

49:22.085 --> 49:24.041
I'll make you a deal.

49:24.504 --> 49:28.417
If you promise to hand over
the person who did this to the police...

49:28.591 --> 49:31.708
...I'II agree to help you
any time you want.

49:33.054 --> 49:34.510
All right.

49:34.681 --> 49:35.716
Why not?

49:42.147 --> 49:45.810
Holy shit, what's this crazy bitch doing?
Why did I agree to work for vampires?

49:45.984 --> 49:50.102
Goddamn it, I knew it was a bad idea.
I've been straight with these fuckers.

49:50.280 --> 49:54.740
Gotta be an idiot to steal from them.
Jesus Christ, I was the one who reported it.

49:54.993 --> 49:56.824
Bruce, it's okay. Take a deep breath.

49:59.205 --> 50:00.536
Did you steal their money?

50:04.794 --> 50:06.000
No.

50:06.171 --> 50:08.913
No, no. You gotta believe me.
I didn't do it. I swear to--

50:10.300 --> 50:11.335
Do you know who did?

50:12.927 --> 50:14.258
No.

50:14.429 --> 50:15.544
No, I wish.

50:15.722 --> 50:18.885
I would turn that fucker in.
Who was it? Couldn't have been Ginger.

50:19.058 --> 50:22.346
She's too dumb. Although
she's hot as shit. I'd fuck her ifl could.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.600
He's telling the truth.

50:24.272 --> 50:26.979
You trust the skinny human
to clear the fat one?

50:31.321 --> 50:33.232
Bring the next one in.

51:29.837 --> 51:31.168
You got cash? Are you buying?

51:31.339 --> 51:34.957
Just remember your lines, that's all
I need from you. I'll handle the rest.

51:35.134 --> 51:39.503
-I'm not gonna have to have sex with him?
-I said that I will handle it.

51:40.139 --> 51:41.879
Okay.

51:42.517 --> 51:45.850
I know you probably don't think
I'm all that smart, but I do know that...

51:46.020 --> 51:49.979
...that vampire can kill us both
before we even get in the door.

51:51.526 --> 51:53.232
You'll handle it.

51:55.446 --> 51:56.526
What the hell is that?

51:56.698 --> 51:59.940
While the wing nuts on the left
keep pushing their so-cal/ed...

52:00.118 --> 52:04.862
. . . vampire-righ ts legislation, / 'm more
concerned with basic human rights.

52:05.039 --> 52:08.998
The right for our sons and daughters
to go to school without fear...

52:09.168 --> 52:12.706
...of molestation by a bloodthirsty predator
in the playground...

52:12.880 --> 52:13.960
...or in the classroom.

52:14.132 --> 52:17.215
Someone has got to take a stand
for public safety...

52:17.385 --> 52:19.751
...over permissiveness and immorality.

52:19.929 --> 52:22.887
If you ask me,
he's protesting a little too hard.

52:23.057 --> 52:26.641
Come out of the closet, Reverend Steve.
I know plenty of friendly vampires...

52:26.811 --> 52:28.676
...who'd like to take a bite out of you.

52:30.815 --> 52:34.899
But truly, it's inflammatory talk
from folks like Steve New/in...

52:35.069 --> 52:38.402
...who make me ashamed
to call myself a human.

52:39.324 --> 52:42.566
Fangs for watching. We 'll be bite back.

52:52.253 --> 52:53.709
Who is it?

52:53.880 --> 52:55.916
I'm a friend of Lafayette Reynolds.

52:56.090 --> 52:58.547
He sent me for you.

53:06.559 --> 53:07.924
-Jesus Christ.
-Get his feet.

53:08.102 --> 53:09.717
-Are you kidding me?
-Get his feet!

53:09.896 --> 53:11.727
-Okay, okay.
-No, please!

53:11.898 --> 53:14.105
-|'|| give you anything you want.
-Shut up!

53:14.275 --> 53:16.516
-Amy, what the hell?
-No names, dumbass.

53:16.694 --> 53:19.731
-I thought we'd take a little blood and go.
-Shut the fuck up.

53:19.906 --> 53:21.942
-Jeez.
-Now, come on, lift.

53:22.116 --> 53:23.617
-What?
-Lift him up.

53:27.497 --> 53:33.208
Please! No!
I'll do anything you want. Please.

53:45.264 --> 53:47.550
This is the last of our humans.

53:48.351 --> 53:49.636
Yummy.

53:50.520 --> 53:53.136
Ginger, this woman
has some questions for you.

53:54.023 --> 53:57.811
-Be a good girl and answer them, will you?
-Aye, aye, master.

53:58.194 --> 53:59.775
Don't you touch me.

54:00.988 --> 54:02.774
Hold her still.

54:06.119 --> 54:08.451
Ginger, someone's been
stealing money from the bar.

54:08.621 --> 54:10.407
Really?

54:10.623 --> 54:14.616
Don’t look at me. I didn't do nothing. l'll
beat the shit out of you if you say I did.

54:14.794 --> 54:16.830
It wasn’t me that took it. It wasn’t me.

54:17.004 --> 54:18.665
She didn't do it...

54:19.340 --> 54:20.955
-...but she knows who did.
-What?

54:21.676 --> 54:22.665
Fuck you.

54:22.844 --> 54:28.055
Shit. How’d she know? I didn’t tell anyone,
I swear. Fuck, he’s gonna kill me.

54:28.224 --> 54:31.011
Who? Who's gonna kill you?

54:31.185 --> 54:33.847
Ginger, honey, what's his name?

54:35.231 --> 54:37.517
It's blank,
like her memory's been erased.

54:37.692 --> 54:39.683
I don't know anything, I swear.

54:39.861 --> 54:42.352
-She's been glamoured.
-It's a vampire.
