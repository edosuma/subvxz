WEBVTT

01:34.679 --> 01:37.098
This is Miller.
Sector one clear.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.267
<i>How are those new men
we sent you?</i>

01:39.350 --> 01:41.269
Feels like we're steppin' on each other.

01:41.352 --> 01:43.187
No one's causing trouble here tonight.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.397
Miller out.

02:18.556 --> 02:20.891
Look the place down!
No one gets in or out!

02:31.235 --> 02:33.321
<i>Get that tanker outside before it blows!</i>

03:12.610 --> 03:13.652
Come in, Bruce.

03:14.111 --> 03:17.198
What a pleasant surprise.
How've you been holding up?

03:17.948 --> 03:18.948
With a cane.

03:21.327 --> 03:22.327
Very clever.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.456
I must say, it's so nice to see you

03:25.539 --> 03:27.416
taking an interest
after all these years.

03:29.794 --> 03:31.629
We're lucky to have you as a resource.

03:31.962 --> 03:32.838
Mmm-hmm.

03:32.922 --> 03:34.757
You should come by more often.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.343
I'll set you up with the finest
office in the building.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.928
Just not this one.

03:39.011 --> 03:41.514
Uh, I prefer you not touch that.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.016
In case you're worried,

03:44.433 --> 03:46.143
I didn't come here to set up shop again.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.854
Why, Bruce! You've misread me.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.398
I don't worry.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.608
I just came to say this.

03:53.526 --> 03:55.486
Keep your hands off Foxteca.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.654
Pardon me?

03:57.029 --> 03:59.490
I may not have the leverage
on paper anymore

03:59.573 --> 04:01.617
but I still have friends.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.954
The Foxes were a valued
part of this company for years.

04:05.037 --> 04:08.290
I'd hate to find out Wayne-Powers
was involved in these attacks.

04:08.791 --> 04:11.794
Bruce, let me put your concerns to rest.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.337
I'd never do such a thing.

04:13.421 --> 04:17.425
Why, Lucius Jr. was still
vice-president when I took over.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.052
I know. You fired him.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.221
Yes, well.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.390
Had to make room
for the new guard, didn't we?

04:30.688 --> 04:33.399
- The McGinnis boy.
- I work for Mr. Wayne now.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.819
Well, yes,
I suppose with your father gone

04:36.902 --> 04:38.362
that would make you the breadwinner.

04:42.992 --> 04:43.992
Goodbye.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.000
- So, did you beat it out of him?
- Not exactly.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.791
But I do have some things to check out.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.835
Okay if I get some time
on my own tonight?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.879
Don't count on it.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.633
- No more interruptions.
<i>- Yes,</i> sir.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.345
That does not make me happy.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.097
Don't worry about Wayne.

05:05.181 --> 05:08.517
That performance was just to
remind me he's still breathing.

05:08.601 --> 05:10.102
And barely, I might add.

05:12.897 --> 05:15.649
- He knows too much.
- He's just fishing.

05:15.733 --> 05:18.277
I'll send up an extra basket
of oranges this Christmas

05:18.360 --> 05:19.653
and he'll be happy.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.820
Moving on.

05:21.405 --> 05:24.158
Here's what I'd like you to do
tonight, my dear.

06:02.488 --> 06:05.157
Is it wrong for me
to root for the other team?

06:05.241 --> 06:06.450
Not under the circumstances.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.246
I'm glad you came out.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.649
I know it's still gotta be tough.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.670
Yeah?

06:17.878 --> 06:18.878
But...

06:19.672 --> 06:20.672
On my way.

06:21.257 --> 06:22.299
Mr. Wayne?

06:22.800 --> 06:24.635
Sure got you on a short leash,
doesn't he?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.971
He needs me. Sorry.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.514
It isn't normal.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.600
You have no idea.

07:03.132 --> 07:05.759
- Wayne, you there?
- Go <i>ahead.</i>

07:05.843 --> 07:08.095
Is there any time of day,
I get to have a social life?

07:08.470 --> 07:09.638
Not in this business.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.890
<i>You get a real kick
out of this, don 't you?</i>

07:11.974 --> 07:14.727
Maybe it should be you up here
instead of me?

07:14.852 --> 07:17.521
- I'm doing my part.
<i>- Which</i> is <i>What again?</i>

07:17.813 --> 07:20.524
I did some digging after I saw
a report on Powers' desk.

07:21.317 --> 07:23.902
It seems that he and Foxteca
are up for the same job.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.323
The government wants a new lunar station

07:27.406 --> 07:28.926
and only one of them gets to build it.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.910
So Powers is crippling
the competition with sabotage.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.954
<i>And until we can stop him,</i>

07:34.038 --> 07:35.789
<i>you're Foxteca's guardian angel.</i>

07:36.582 --> 07:38.125
<i>Now, tell me what you see.</i>

07:38.208 --> 07:40.377
Looks like
someone's celebrating July 4th.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.921
Inside their office. I'm goin' in.

08:18.374 --> 08:19.917
McGinnis, get out of there!

08:20.292 --> 08:21.627
In a second.
I'm lookin' around.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.379
<i>I said get out! Now!</i>

08:23.462 --> 08:24.963
Why? What's the...

08:46.819 --> 08:48.779
What the heck was that?

08:53.492 --> 08:56.120
What did you send me into?
It was like some kinda blob!

08:56.203 --> 08:58.956
- You should've warned me!
- I tried.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.639
You have to learn to think on your feet.

09:02.126 --> 09:05.045
Look. You may be used to
dealing with freaks and monsters

09:05.129 --> 09:06.289
but I'm a little new at this.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.382
I don't even know
what half this stuff is.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.844
Way before your time. Here.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.595
Her name's Inque.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.639
She's a corporate saboteur.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.641
INTERPOL's been after her for years.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.935
It looks like Powers
is her new employer.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.437
What is she?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.605
The result of a mutagenic experiment.

09:23.689 --> 09:27.067
- The details aren't known.
- So, how do you stop her?

09:27.151 --> 09:29.111
That's where thinking on your feet
comes in.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.134
This is unbearably cool.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.344
<i>Remember. Easy gesture.</i>

09:54.428 --> 09:55.888
<i>Let the suit do the work.</i>

09:57.514 --> 09:58.849
Whoo-hoo!

09:59.516 --> 10:01.226
- Mind not doing that.
- Sony.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.021
<i>You scratch it, no allowance.</i>

10:39.848 --> 10:43.185
<i>I just picked up a radio call.
Fox's shipping unit. Pier 18.</i>

10:44.102 --> 10:45.187
I'm on it.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.672
Not exactly a fast learner,
are you?

12:24.953 --> 12:26.330
You don't like the water, do you?

12:59.196 --> 13:01.365
<i>Unfortunately,
last night's damage was minimal.</i>

13:01.907 --> 13:03.533
<i>They're still meeting their schedule.</i>

13:04.242 --> 13:05.577
Splendid.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.291
We need to talk.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.628
This better be good. What happened?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.547
Someone's been interfering.
This is the second time.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.508
- Who?
- I don't know.

13:19.591 --> 13:22.636
He wore a costume. Black and red.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.055
- Batman.
<i>- The</i> Batman?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.682
What difference does it make!

13:26.765 --> 13:28.225
What's happening to you?

13:28.558 --> 13:31.645
I have a condition.
I trust you'll be discrete.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.939
I'm putting you on a new assignment.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.316
Find this Batman and kill him.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.193
He has an accomplice.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.904
I heard him speak with someone
over a radio link.

13:41.613 --> 13:44.574
Then do them both!
I'll pay you whatever you want.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.910
No wonder I like working for you.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.787
Now, I suggest you leave.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.873
It's not healthy to be around me
when I'm shedding.

14:17.983 --> 14:19.651
Bad news. We're too late.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.631
- He's here.
<i>- Excellent.</i>

14:42.299 --> 14:43.550
I'll see you when you're done.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.595
At which time, I should be back
to my old self.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.069
<i>There's nothing you can do.
Come home.</i>

15:17.876 --> 15:19.476
The car's feelin'
kinda sluggish tonight.

15:19.795 --> 15:21.630
Park and I'll run a diagnostic.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.599
It's too heavy.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.689
Look out!

15:54.955 --> 15:56.373
Open wide.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.537
- What kept you?
- Sudden case of shyness.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.263
This isn't good.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.525
She's heading upstairs!

17:11.031 --> 17:12.115
Pays to be prepared.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.535
Someone's got a secret.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.037
She's getting through.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.755
Man, you are prepared.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.302
She won't get through that way, either.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.845
There's a layer of solid steel.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.975
I think she has something else in mind.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.154
Look out!

19:08.231 --> 19:09.566
That's it.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.192
You're showing me everything.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.332
Gordon.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.584
I figured I'd hear from you.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.267
Word is you've wrangled
a new errand boy.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.964
I never wrangled anyone.
Every one of you came to me.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.640
Maybe once, you should
talk someone out of it.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.719
<i>Would it have worked with you?</i>

19:38.303 --> 19:39.804
I don't suppose you wanna meet him?

19:39.888 --> 19:41.014
You know I can't.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.142
<i>Because he's leaving you
a get-acquainted gift right now.</i>

19:48.646 --> 19:49.731
<i>I'd keep it on ice.</i>
