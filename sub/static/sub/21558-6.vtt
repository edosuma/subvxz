00:15.098 --> 00:17.850
[classical music playing]

00:56.098 --> 00:59.351
[record skipping]

01:48.900 --> 01:51.611
-You okay?
-[sighs] Yeah, I mean...

01:52.695 --> 01:54.322
my head's still attached.

01:55.031 --> 01:58.201
-You didn't have to kill him.
-[Stick] Eh, it was him or the kid.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.870
[Danny] They could've stopped him.

02:00.953 --> 02:02.997
[Stick] Couldn't take the chance,
especially now.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.499
[Luke] What do you mean, "Especially now"?

02:04.582 --> 02:06.042
[Stick] We got our answer.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.462
He's what they've been after all along.

02:09.546 --> 02:10.922
[Luke] Yeah, well, we knew that.

02:11.005 --> 02:15.135
We didn't know the Iron Fist
was the key to what the Hand seeks.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.679
The word isn't accidental.

02:17.762 --> 02:20.432
You think he's a key?
To what, their survival?

02:20.515 --> 02:21.974
A key implies a lock.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.603
-I assumed it was a metaphor.
-[Stick] It's not.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.315
So you literally think
Danny opens something?

02:28.940 --> 02:33.069
And that something is worth dying for.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.656
I'm a weapon. I'm not a key.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.617
-[Stick] That you know of.
-What could I possibly open?

02:39.701 --> 02:43.079
[scoffs] You tell me.
Must be why they haven't killed you.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.665
They haven't killed me because
they want me on their side.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.168
The Iron Fist's chi is a weapon.
That's true.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.380
But I've heard stories
about it being used for more.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.925
To seal things shut.
Or opening them again.

02:56.008 --> 02:59.178
So the Hand is in New York
because he gives them access

02:59.262 --> 03:01.180
or opens something up?

03:01.264 --> 03:02.682
Come on, guys. [chuckles]

03:03.933 --> 03:05.310
That's insane.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.144
Well, it doesn't matter
if you think it's true or not.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.646
It's something they believe is true.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.065
He was a member of the Hand.

03:11.148 --> 03:14.068
An organization formed
by lying psychopaths.

03:14.151 --> 03:15.653
You can't trust a word he said.

03:15.778 --> 03:16.863
[Matt] I understand that, Danny,

03:16.946 --> 03:19.699
but the way I see it,
we only have one move.

03:23.202 --> 03:26.163
Whoa. What do you mean?

03:26.248 --> 03:29.751
To keep the Iron Fist
as far from them as possible.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.462
It sounds crazy, but I don't think
we have any other way.

03:33.421 --> 03:36.799
I dedicated my life to this fight.
You need me.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.968
We all need each other.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.515
This is exactly how they work.

03:43.598 --> 03:47.018
They divide us. They get into our heads.
They weaken us.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.645
They make you question
the people you trust.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.814
Danny, just take a deep breath
and calm down.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.652
Stop telling me to calm down, Luke!
This is what they want!

03:56.403 --> 03:59.322
They want you to be distracted.
[stammers] They want you to turn on me.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.948
[Matt] Sowande wasn't lying.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.450
[Danny] And how do you know?

04:02.534 --> 04:04.286
His heartbeat didn't waver.
Not for a second.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.538
And where was his heartbeat
when he came up behind me?

04:07.997 --> 04:10.667
It's the Hand.
You know how they can operate.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.836
And now we know what they need.
It's you, kid.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.298
Stick, you're falling for their trap.

04:16.381 --> 04:19.592
If Alexandra gets a hold of you,
the war's lost.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.845
I can't allow that.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.975
Listen, Stick, maybe we should just...
uh, let him lay low, or just...

04:28.059 --> 04:29.185
Maybe we should just hide him.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.812
We're running out of time!

04:31.563 --> 04:35.107
They're hunting our friends, our families,
and they're not gonna stop there.

04:35.191 --> 04:39.153
You heard what he said.
This ends with New York in ruins.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.991
They want me on the sidelines 'cause
I'm the only one who can destroy them.

04:47.036 --> 04:47.954
Jess?

04:50.748 --> 04:52.166
How do you suggest we hide him?

04:58.881 --> 04:59.882
Fine.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.053
I'll go back to doing this
without you if I have to.

05:05.347 --> 05:09.016
I've already lost one city.
I'm not losing another.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.185
Me neither.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.646
Really?

05:14.731 --> 05:17.567
[scoffs] You're gonna try
and keep me here against my will?

05:17.650 --> 05:19.151
I hear what you're saying, Danny, but...

05:19.235 --> 05:22.113
And no one loves this city more than I do,
but you can't leave this room.

05:22.196 --> 05:23.531
[scoffing]

05:24.824 --> 05:25.825
Whatever.

05:27.243 --> 05:28.370
[huffs]

05:31.956 --> 05:36.002
-You sure you want to do this?
-No, I don't want to, but if I have to.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.629
Same way you had to keep
your girlfriend secret?

05:37.712 --> 05:38.880
-We're past that.
-No, we're not.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.383
-Danny, we're all on the same side here.
-It doesn't feel like it.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.719
-Not anymore.
-Don't do this.

05:46.638 --> 05:50.392
[breathing heavily] Hey,
you guys seriously need to back off.

05:51.559 --> 05:54.103
You just stay here.
We can keep you safe, all right?

05:54.186 --> 05:55.730
You just need to calm down.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.314
Well, that's the problem, Matt.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.943
I'm all out of calm.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.695
[grunts]

06:05.239 --> 06:07.409
[both grunting]

06:14.248 --> 06:15.374
[grunts]

06:42.902 --> 06:45.154
Hey! Enough.

06:45.738 --> 06:46.739
[grunts]

06:48.741 --> 06:49.909
[Matt groans]

06:50.743 --> 06:51.953
[Jessica grunts]

06:52.036 --> 06:53.788
[groans and spits]

06:54.789 --> 06:57.041
Don't make me use this. [grunts]

07:00.169 --> 07:01.128
[grunts]

07:07.510 --> 07:08.845
[energy pulsating]

07:08.928 --> 07:09.971
[groans]

07:10.054 --> 07:11.973
[groans]

07:12.056 --> 07:14.308
[coughs and groans]

07:21.649 --> 07:23.526
[panting]

07:27.154 --> 07:29.031
-[straining]
-[grunts]

07:33.953 --> 07:35.329
-Sorry about this.
-[groans]

07:38.666 --> 07:40.668
[theme music playing]

08:58.162 --> 09:00.247
Nice way to spend your time
fresh out of prison.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.916
[chuckles] Yeah.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.211
I can't believe this is what it took
for us to talk again.

09:06.045 --> 09:09.506
I'm not good at keeping in touch.
But you could've called.

09:12.509 --> 09:13.510
Fair enough.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.024
You think that'll hold?

09:27.108 --> 09:30.737
Well, it's a constrictor knot.
Harder he pulls, harder it cinches.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.446
Rope's not your concern.

09:32.529 --> 09:33.906
I'm gonna assume it's his Fist.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.492
When he summons it, shit goes sideways.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.785
[Luke] How long do we have?

09:38.452 --> 09:41.080
Hard to say. Eh, maybe an hour.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.124
And we need to figure out
what he's the key to.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.251
Their headquarters is Midland Circle.

09:45.334 --> 09:46.543
[Luke] Yeah, we knew that.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.296
Matty, you ever go back to that place?

09:49.380 --> 09:51.465
Go back?
What, have you been there before?

09:51.548 --> 09:54.510
Yeah. Um, last year,
when I was investigating the Hand,

09:54.594 --> 09:57.054
the, uh, trail led me
to a construction site,

09:57.138 --> 09:58.555
which is now Midland Circle.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.225
Uh, there was a hole there.
Hundreds of feet deep.

10:01.308 --> 10:02.393
In the middle of New York?

10:02.476 --> 10:05.229
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-And you're just now remembering this?

10:05.312 --> 10:08.274
[Stick] You sense anything
at the bottom of that hole?

10:08.357 --> 10:10.610
I don't think so. I kept tabs on it.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.154
Once the building was finished,
my sense was the hole was gone.

10:13.237 --> 10:15.197
-[Stick] You sure?
-[Matt] I'm not sure of anything anymore.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.448
You didn't answer her question.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.117
How come we are now
just hearing about this?

10:18.200 --> 10:19.661
-It wasn't important, Luke.
-Try again.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.788
What? No. [stammers]
We had enough to worry about.

10:21.871 --> 10:22.997
What aren't you telling us?

10:26.959 --> 10:28.419
I was with Elektra.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.337
[Luke sighs]

10:30.421 --> 10:32.799
It was a mistake not telling you guys
about her. I realize that--

10:32.882 --> 10:37.053
The next time you conveniently forget shit
that affects the rest of us...

10:37.136 --> 10:38.888
You're not exactly
an open book yourself, Jessica.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.348
-What is that supposed to mean?
-Well, no one's digging into your past.

10:41.432 --> 10:45.311
My past is none of your goddamn business,
and it's not actively trying to kill us.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.521
-[Stick] Clock is ticking.
-So if we need more answers,

10:47.604 --> 10:49.565
going back to Midland Circle
is the only play.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.318
We barely made it out last time,
and they're gonna be waiting for us.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.529
-Yeah, she's right.
-So how do we find whatever he opens?

10:56.572 --> 10:57.699
The architect?

10:58.741 --> 11:02.161
My client's husband.
The one your girlfriend tried to kill.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.205
He designed the place.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.290
What, you think he knows
how Danny ties into this?

11:06.373 --> 11:07.709
[stutters] It's worth a shot.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.503
-Well, I guess you two better get going.
-[Jessica sighs]

11:11.587 --> 11:12.671
[Matt] What about you?

11:14.631 --> 11:16.759
Somebody's gotta stay and watch him.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.511
Preferably somebody who can take a punch.

11:45.162 --> 11:46.372
I know you're awake.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.333
[both chuckle]

11:52.128 --> 11:53.379
Yes, I am.

11:55.422 --> 11:57.716
-[groans]
-You've been sleeping for hours.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.969
[sighs] Thank you.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.154
I like it here.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.032
Back in New York?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.200
No.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.577
Back with you.

12:27.955 --> 12:28.998
[Matt chuckles]

12:29.623 --> 12:31.625
[sirens wailing]

12:31.708 --> 12:32.960
[horn blaring]

13:26.597 --> 13:27.598
[sniffles]

13:31.978 --> 13:33.145
[sighs]

13:33.855 --> 13:37.149
-Well, Danny's still knocked out.
-Good.

13:38.109 --> 13:41.528
[sighs] You know, after years
of tracking these assholes,

13:41.612 --> 13:43.948
you hear about all the shit they've done.

13:44.031 --> 13:47.618
And even after you take 'em off the count
and they're dead...

13:48.369 --> 13:50.872
it's still enough to keep you up at night.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.416
Where'd you find this piece of shit?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.627
Warehouse on 151st and Amsterdam.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.005
He was hiring kids out of Harlem.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.423
Using them as a cleanup crew.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.385
Destroying bodies at
an abandoned warehouse in Chinatown.

14:04.468 --> 14:08.222
Our headquarters.
Those bodies were the last of us.

14:09.765 --> 14:13.602
[sighs] Watch the kid.
I'll take care of this.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.396
What do you mean, take care of it?

14:15.479 --> 14:18.649
I mean, Hand-related or not,
that was a homicide, man.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.320
You are right again.
Less you know, the better.

14:24.571 --> 14:26.698
[scoffs] What are you gonna do,
get rid of the body?

14:26.782 --> 14:29.368
Yeah. Something like that.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.414
Yeah, you're right.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.917
Less I know, the better.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.838
So you wanna tell me how a pro bono lawyer

14:41.923 --> 14:44.050
can afford a loft like this
in New York City?

14:44.133 --> 14:47.261
You can't tell now, but there's
a neon billboard across the street.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.721
Keeps most people up at night...

14:50.639 --> 14:51.640
not me.

14:52.683 --> 14:53.809
Got it.

14:54.768 --> 14:57.271
Plus, I occasionally help
the landlord out.

14:58.439 --> 15:03.235
Not proud of it, but I put on the suit
and rough up people late on rent.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.696
I hope that's a joke.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.323
[chuckles]

15:08.615 --> 15:09.866
Sorry about the mess.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.121
[sighs] It's all right.
You should see my place.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.165
What, do you work from home?

15:16.248 --> 15:18.750
I used to have a partner.
We had an office.

15:19.751 --> 15:20.836
And?

15:21.628 --> 15:22.796
Now we don't.

15:23.839 --> 15:24.924
You ready?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.093
Yeah.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.479
Everything okay?

15:40.856 --> 15:41.983
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

15:45.652 --> 15:46.653
Let's go.

15:58.790 --> 16:03.254
[Alexandra] An operative discovered this
at one of Sowande's warehouses.

16:04.005 --> 16:07.383
Delivered, no doubt,
by our old friend Stick.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.304
Sowande has been with us
since we departed K'un-Lun.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.808
His loss will be felt
throughout our entire organization.

16:18.810 --> 16:20.437
[in Japanese] It has happened.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.108
This is what mortality looks like.

16:24.191 --> 16:28.154
-[Gao] A loss we could have prevented.
-He got himself captured.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.323
-We didn't even try to find him.
-Oh, please.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.995
-Let's not pretend to mourn this loss.
-Pretend?

16:36.078 --> 16:38.539
As if our time together
has always been peaceful.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.292
As if there's never been any discord.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.836
As if we haven't all survived
assassination attempts

16:44.920 --> 16:48.174
by those across from us in this very room.

16:59.018 --> 17:04.106
Now, more than ever,
it's time to show unity.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.442
[in Japanese] We were unified.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.735
Until you brought
the Black Sky into the fold.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.446
Where is she?

17:10.529 --> 17:12.406
-She's safe.
-What does that mean?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.825
I don't think I have to answer to you.

17:14.908 --> 17:17.744
But considering the events
of the last few hours,

17:17.828 --> 17:20.164
I thought it best to keep her isolated.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.833
Because you think we will kill her?

17:22.916 --> 17:24.085
No.

17:25.336 --> 17:30.591
I think she might kill you
if she even senses your disloyalty.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.760
We mean no disloyalty.

17:33.844 --> 17:38.640
Our goals are in alignment,
as they have been for centuries.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.269
I am not so sure anymore.

17:42.353 --> 17:47.441
We must honor Sowande
by continuing to fight for what he lost.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.735
-[tapping cane]
-Life itself.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.654
Our leader has brought us this far.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.283
And I for one will continue to follow her,

17:56.367 --> 18:01.913
until we have the Iron Fist.
Until we get what we need from New York.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.341
[Jessica sighs] I think it's up here.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.510
-[Matt] You think?
-I don't know.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.012
All these brownstones look the same,
don't they?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.472
-[chuckles]
-Oh, shit.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.642
-Sorry, I keep forgetting you're--
-Don't worry about it. Happens.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.895
So, what do I need to know
about the architect?

18:24.978 --> 18:27.356
[sighs] His wife hired me to find him.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.649
He didn't tell her much.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.735
Especially not about some secret tunnel
under New York.

18:31.818 --> 18:34.196
Not a tunnel. It's a hole, straight down.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.073
Right. Well, right before he shot himself,

18:37.158 --> 18:39.075
he said "they" were going to
take down the city.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.120
Obviously, we know now
"they" are the Hand.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.498
-Was he one of them?
-He said he was one of the good guys.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.583
And you believed him?

18:48.043 --> 18:50.129
I don't read heartbeats,
but I do read people.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.757
He was desperate.
He started stockpiling explosives.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.634
And you think his target
was Midland Circle?

18:56.177 --> 18:59.930
Maybe. [sighs]
Actually, I think this is it.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.099
-You think?
-[sighs] Ninety-nine percent.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.936
Ninety-two percent.
But that's still a lot.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.283
-Lexi, right?
-My mom isn't here.

19:20.992 --> 19:22.744
You have any idea when she'll be back?

19:24.538 --> 19:25.789
What do you want?

19:26.457 --> 19:28.834
-Just to talk.
-About my dad again?

19:28.917 --> 19:30.126
About what happened.

19:30.877 --> 19:33.839
You said so yourself. He got mixed up
with the mob or something.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.966
-[Matt] Wasn't the mob.
-Sorry. Who are you?

19:36.049 --> 19:39.094
-He's a lawyer.
-A what?

19:39.178 --> 19:42.806
Lexi, my name is Matthew Murdock.
We think there's more to your dad's story.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.934
If you could just answer a couple
of questions, it'd be a tremendous help.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.313
Okay.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.735
[Alexandra grunts]

20:07.706 --> 20:09.082
[sighs]

20:09.165 --> 20:11.752
Closed door used to mean something.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.129
My apologies.

20:16.047 --> 20:20.844
In all the time we've known each other,
I've never seen you like this.

20:26.767 --> 20:31.187
Your position is one of great power.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.317
But it is a burden as much as a blessing.

20:35.401 --> 20:39.655
Which is why I've convinced the others
to follow your lead.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.202
[Alexandra] You and I have
always understood each other.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.163
Under a single condition.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.625
We will seek out and capture
the Iron Fist ourselves

20:51.708 --> 20:53.126
without the Black Sky.

20:53.209 --> 20:56.212
It's not like you
to show such a lack of faith.

20:56.297 --> 21:00.091
And it's not like you, Alexandra,
to show such...

21:02.386 --> 21:03.470
Weakness?

21:05.055 --> 21:10.226
Our brothers, while clumsy in delivery,
speak the truth.

21:10.894 --> 21:14.690
The Black Sky has always been
your prophecy, your vision.

21:15.857 --> 21:18.234
-And you have failed.
-I don't agree.

21:18.319 --> 21:22.072
She is essential to our success.
You must talk to them.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.574
I've tried.

21:23.657 --> 21:27.786
Ever since her resurrection,
we are no closer to the Iron Fist,

21:27.869 --> 21:30.956
or the substance,
or returning to K'un-Lun.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.667
The only thing we're closer to is death.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.752
How can you not see what I see?

21:35.836 --> 21:37.504
Oh, she is skilled, yes--

21:37.588 --> 21:39.715
I'm not talking about her abilities.

21:40.799 --> 21:44.135
She has a strength
that you and I can only imagine.

21:44.720 --> 21:50.183
[chuckles] Even if I did,
the others do not feel the same way.

21:50.266 --> 21:52.394
The others want my seat at the table.

21:53.228 --> 21:56.940
As you said, it has happened before.
I was there.

21:57.983 --> 22:00.819
Gao, you were the one who led it.

22:03.154 --> 22:04.698
Past is the past.

22:05.782 --> 22:08.410
Right now, I may be your only ally.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.831
And you don't believe the Black Sky
is enough to save us?

22:12.914 --> 22:15.876
I have learned not to believe in anything.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.421
But our time together is not over.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.964
Not yet.

22:21.923 --> 22:24.092
Consider my proposal.

22:25.427 --> 22:28.680
We could be ready to move tonight.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.482
You were right.

23:01.212 --> 23:02.548
[grunting]

23:03.799 --> 23:05.801
[gasping and coughing]

23:11.097 --> 23:13.684
I'll be right here when you're done.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.105
You've got me tied up like a prisoner.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.569
Not "like." You're definitely a prisoner.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.029
It's not a good look.

23:27.656 --> 23:30.200
Where's Matt? Where's Jessica?

23:30.283 --> 23:35.246
They're digging up info on Midland Circle.
We think that's where it all started.

23:35.330 --> 23:38.875
"We"? As in the rest of you
who worked against me?

23:40.502 --> 23:42.838
[sighs] Look.

23:43.464 --> 23:44.923
If you'd listened instead of fighting us,

23:45.006 --> 23:46.967
you would've been
around for the conversation.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.510
And I think you would've agreed.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.473
Midland Circle's suspect.
Especially now that we found the hole.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.099
What hole?

23:54.725 --> 23:57.686
Murdock thinks there's something weird
about Midland Circle.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.899
And they got you on guard duty. [scoffs]

24:02.983 --> 24:04.485
Nah, that depends on you.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.028
Big mistake.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.615
[grunting and choking]

24:10.532 --> 24:13.201
-[chuckling]
-[breathing heavily]

24:14.452 --> 24:15.912
Don't you see what's happening?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.165
You've got me tied up like I'm the enemy,

24:19.249 --> 24:21.960
and they're out there trying to kill
the people we care about.

24:22.043 --> 24:24.420
-Misty's keeping everyone safe.
-For now.

24:24.505 --> 24:26.965
But I care about a lot more people
than we can fit in a police station.

24:28.174 --> 24:29.635
And I know you do, too.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.596
This city is at stake.

24:34.305 --> 24:35.390
Me and you...

24:36.391 --> 24:38.184
Luke Cage and the Iron Fist...

24:39.019 --> 24:40.020
we belong out there.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.774
Together, on the front lines.

24:45.316 --> 24:48.028
Look, I don't like to fight.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.364
But if I have to do it, I do it smart.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.034
Locking me up is not smart.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.579
Neither is fighting three people
that happen to be on your side.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.207
[breathes heavily]

25:02.959 --> 25:05.796
The moment I can refocus my chi,
I'm getting out of this chair.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.423
I'll be waiting.

25:18.058 --> 25:19.059
[sighs]

25:19.142 --> 25:20.226
What's he doing?

25:24.981 --> 25:26.858
-[exhales heavily]
-[Luke] Meditating.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.152
I think.

25:30.904 --> 25:36.367
He said something about crane pose
and centering his animal.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.078
Then I tuned him out.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.872
Anima.

25:41.998 --> 25:44.292
-What?
-He's centering his anima.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.379
Mmm, sure.
Uh, I'm not into that mystic stuff.

25:49.673 --> 25:51.382
It's not "mystic stuff."

25:53.301 --> 25:55.136
It's just a different way
of viewing the world.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.056
-Quite different.
-Yeah.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.059
It's about perspective.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.104
[chuckles] Hey,
why don't you tell me again

26:04.187 --> 26:06.982
about how you punched the dragon
and got your magic hand?

26:09.484 --> 26:11.987
During the final trial
of Shou-Lao the Undying,

26:12.654 --> 26:16.032
-I plunged my fist into his molten heart.
-Dude, I was kidding.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.243
[scoffs]

26:20.912 --> 26:22.914
[sighs heavily]

26:27.168 --> 26:28.586
[sighs]

26:33.549 --> 26:34.843
Molten heart, huh?

26:36.887 --> 26:38.304
I bet that must've hurt.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.768
[chuckles softly] Yeah.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.646
Like you wouldn't believe.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.730
Hmm.

26:48.064 --> 26:51.317
I took a direct hit
from a rocket launcher once.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.781
Got blasted in the face with a shotgun.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.408
By Jessica.

27:00.493 --> 27:01.662
Our Jessica?

27:01.745 --> 27:06.041
[chuckles] Trust me, I'd face a dragon
over Jessica Jones any day.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.709
[both chuckling]

27:11.629 --> 27:12.756
What happened between you two?

27:16.927 --> 27:18.178
We had a moment.

27:21.514 --> 27:26.812
But we both had to go
on our different paths, so we...

27:26.895 --> 27:29.064
[breathes heavily]

27:29.647 --> 27:30.857
Different paths?

27:32.442 --> 27:33.944
[chuckles]

27:34.610 --> 27:37.906
You know, you're starting
to sound like me. [chuckles]

27:40.575 --> 27:42.160
[both chuckling]

27:46.622 --> 27:49.710
[Lexi] I don't know what you think
you're gonna find. It's simple.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.920
My dad abandoned us
and got himself killed.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.004
[sighs]

27:53.964 --> 27:56.674
-I know it's probably hard to understand--
-Actually, it's not.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.179
Your dad didn't wanna hurt you
or your mom.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.140
Yeah, well, she cries herself to sleep
every night now. So...

28:04.975 --> 28:07.102
[Matt] Lexi, did your dad have
an office in the house?

28:07.811 --> 28:11.982
No, he... he kept work and life separate.
Some good that did him.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.446
You know, Lexi, you remind me
of a friend of mine.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.574
His dad was a boxer...

28:22.492 --> 28:25.495
who got in way over his head
and got himself killed.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.331
And for a long time,

28:29.624 --> 28:31.709
my friend thought
his dad abandoned him, too.

28:32.627 --> 28:34.295
Until one day, he learned the truth,

28:34.379 --> 28:37.924
that his dad was actually killed because
he wanted to stop being a criminal.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.927
Because he wanted his son
to be proud of him.

28:42.678 --> 28:45.223
Whatever. I'm just trying to say
that my friend's dad was a good guy

28:45.306 --> 28:46.641
and maybe yours was, too.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.324
[Alexandra] Her name was Elektra Natchios.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.577
You are not her.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.290
You are much more than she ever was.

29:11.624 --> 29:12.918
There was a man.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.797
They call him the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

29:17.463 --> 29:20.300
And in this other life,
he let Elektra die.

29:23.594 --> 29:25.721
Is he the one I faced in battle?

29:27.515 --> 29:31.477
He may try to deceive you again
and turn you away from us.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.521
That won't happen.

29:37.608 --> 29:39.778
There's something else you should know.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.490
Something about me.

29:46.659 --> 29:47.660
I'm dying.

29:48.829 --> 29:52.332
You cannot die. The Hand lives forever.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.792
We want to.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.294
But even our bodies
have always had limits.

29:56.377 --> 29:59.630
And when death doesn't come
from outside forces...

30:00.548 --> 30:02.926
sometimes the organism
tries to end itself.

30:04.510 --> 30:09.891
The thing I need is a substance
that we first discovered at K'un-Lun.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.937
And for years, it served
to bring us back from death.

30:14.020 --> 30:17.232
I used the last of it
to bring you back to life.

30:18.524 --> 30:19.525
Why?

30:20.318 --> 30:22.778
Because I knew you would be our salvation.

30:23.571 --> 30:25.073
And then seeing you,

30:25.156 --> 30:30.703
I realized that after all this time,
and even with the others at my side...

30:31.830 --> 30:34.790
I was tired of being alone.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.631
If we don't find more of this substance,

30:42.924 --> 30:44.509
we'll both die?

30:44.592 --> 30:45.593
Yes.

30:46.302 --> 30:48.972
You need to make sure that doesn't happen.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.350
You are the Black Sky.

30:53.726 --> 30:58.189
And when this is over,
you and I, the two of us...

30:58.273 --> 31:01.526
Will serve life. Always.

31:17.417 --> 31:20.003
[Stick] Your heart rate is slowing down.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.673
Hmm. Breathing.

31:25.341 --> 31:29.804
That's how good chi is born...
[inhales deeply]

31:29.888 --> 31:35.101
and bad chi is expelled from the body.
[exhales heavily]

31:35.185 --> 31:36.436
[scoffs]

31:37.478 --> 31:39.480
It's a little more complicated than that.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.357
Not by much.

31:41.441 --> 31:44.444
You know, from the others,
I could've expected this.

31:44.527 --> 31:47.030
But you of all people should understand.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.200
We are at war.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.494
And winning that war is our duty.

31:55.121 --> 31:59.000
Fighting it, maybe. But winning it...

32:00.460 --> 32:03.254
[sighs] is gonna take something else.

32:03.879 --> 32:06.925
-You trained with the same elders I did?
-No.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.635
Then what makes you think
tying me up is the right choice?

32:09.719 --> 32:12.680
It seems like you're just making this up
as you go along.

32:12.763 --> 32:14.015
I am, kid.

32:15.766 --> 32:17.602
That's what survivors do.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.067
To be honest, [sighs]
I don't even know where to start.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.027
[Jessica] Start at the beginning.

32:28.613 --> 32:32.408
[chuckles] My dad was...
was one of those guys...

32:34.202 --> 32:36.246
He was so nice, it was boring.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.663
[chuckles]

32:38.623 --> 32:41.792
-And then?
-Uh, and then he changed.

32:43.711 --> 32:47.090
He worked more, which...
which wasn't that weird, but...

32:47.173 --> 32:48.883
But then he stopped sleeping.

32:49.884 --> 32:52.512
I could hear him at night,
pacing down here.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.681
[sniffles] He stopped eating with us.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.976
He stopped eating, period.

32:59.185 --> 33:03.982
He'd sit at the piano sometimes,
but he wouldn't play.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.609
Not like he used to.

33:07.193 --> 33:08.944
He didn't do anything like he used to.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.489
I missed him.

33:12.782 --> 33:15.201
[sniffles] Long before my mom came to you.

33:15.826 --> 33:17.328
Long before he died.

33:18.954 --> 33:21.332
-Do you play?
-Excuse me?

33:21.416 --> 33:24.294
-The piano.
-Uh, no. You?

33:25.211 --> 33:29.007
Uh, yeah. I learned a little
in church, growing up.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.926
-Dude, what are you doing?
-Just... Do you mind?

33:32.510 --> 33:34.387
-Oh, it's straight ahead.
-Here?

33:34.470 --> 33:35.471
Yeah.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.808
[Matt] Uh, I wasn't very good, but...

33:53.573 --> 33:56.200
[playing slow tune]

34:08.421 --> 34:11.132
-Come on, we should go.
-Just give me a second here.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.885
[continues playing piano]

34:16.929 --> 34:20.308
-[sounding note]
-[object rustling]

34:20.391 --> 34:22.268
-You hear that?
-[Jessica] Mmm-hmm.

34:22.352 --> 34:24.395
-D-sharp.
-[sounding note]

34:24.479 --> 34:28.149
The hammer's ruffling something
before it hits the string here. Here.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.030
Whoa, what are those?

34:38.451 --> 34:39.452
[Jessica gasps]

34:40.411 --> 34:43.956
Looks like the plans to the building
your dad was working on.

34:44.039 --> 34:45.333
[Lexi] In the piano?

34:45.416 --> 34:47.543
He didn't want them
to get into the wrong hands.

34:47.627 --> 34:50.380
And yours... the right ones?

34:50.463 --> 34:52.798
Lexi, I promise,
whatever your dad was doing,

34:52.882 --> 34:54.092
we're on your side now.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.427
But we're gonna need a minute here, okay?

34:57.803 --> 34:59.222
He was gonna blow it up for sure.

35:02.558 --> 35:04.269
-Oh, shit.
-What?

35:05.478 --> 35:06.896
This isn't for the building.

35:07.980 --> 35:12.067
No, this is something else.
This is something below the building.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.279
-The hole?
-No.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.489
Whatever this is,
it's at the bottom of the hole.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.534
There's something under Midland Circle.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.262
-[Luke] How you feeling?
-[Stick] Never better.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.516
But you and the kid
ain't drinking buddies.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.601
Don't let him get your guard down.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.938
He's frustrated, that's all.

35:49.021 --> 35:51.899
Yeah? Give him a second,
he'll take us both out.

35:51.982 --> 35:53.526
Yeah, so he said.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.572
[Stick] I heard the girl say
you were fresh out of prison.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.284
Yeah?

36:03.328 --> 36:05.580
-That's behind me now.
-No, it's not.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.208
Never is. Not really.

36:08.999 --> 36:12.587
-No matter how many punches you pull.
-What's that supposed to mean?

36:12.670 --> 36:14.922
That means when the shit hits the fan,

36:15.005 --> 36:18.301
you could do a lot more damage
if you let yourself go.

36:18.384 --> 36:21.929
I'm not here to do damage.
I take no joy in watching people get hurt.

36:23.013 --> 36:25.933
I'm here for answers. That's it.

36:28.436 --> 36:29.895
I was in the joint, too.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.815
Before I went to war with the Hand.

36:33.524 --> 36:36.444
When I was a kid. Ten years.

36:37.612 --> 36:41.115
That was a lot of fun,
being blind on the inside.

36:43.201 --> 36:47.288
Then I met these people
who taught me how to fight for real.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.334
Taught me how the world works for real.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.421
When I got out, I had purpose.

36:59.174 --> 37:02.970
These people,
these the ones you call the Chaste?

37:03.888 --> 37:04.889
Yeah.

37:05.848 --> 37:07.892
Closest I ever had to family.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.354
[sighs] Aside from Matty.

37:12.438 --> 37:13.814
And Elektra.

37:13.898 --> 37:16.817
-Sorry for your loss.
-Thanks.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.487
It's nothin' compared to what comes next.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.572
[strikes match]

37:21.656 --> 37:23.157
What's with the incense?

37:24.199 --> 37:27.370
Mmm... Helps me meditate.

37:29.163 --> 37:30.665
Ask for guidance.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.834
Forgiveness. That kinda thing.

37:42.301 --> 37:45.471
So the architect discovers a structure
underneath his building.

37:45.555 --> 37:48.766
And whatever it is, it's bad enough
that he dies trying to blow it up.

37:48.849 --> 37:50.268
Right, he wanted to destroy it.

37:50.351 --> 37:53.228
But he didn't want to blow it up.
I think he wanted to collapse it down.

37:53.896 --> 37:55.565
Are you sure the structure
in the hole is man-made?

37:55.648 --> 37:57.024
Could it be some sort of bedrock?

37:57.107 --> 37:59.444
Thirty stories deep, in a perfect dome?

38:00.027 --> 38:01.404
All right. Fair enough.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.282
Jessica?

38:05.616 --> 38:06.659
How'd you know?

38:07.702 --> 38:08.786
About what?

38:09.787 --> 38:11.456
[sighs] About my dad.

38:12.498 --> 38:14.208
A crime-fighting blind lawyer,

38:14.292 --> 38:16.502
I figured there had gotta be
a good story there.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.463
Or a shitty one.

38:19.755 --> 38:21.632
You took my case, I took yours.

38:23.175 --> 38:27.888
I just think we'll work better together
if we trust each other. Don't you?

38:28.473 --> 38:30.140
That is the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

38:30.224 --> 38:31.851
Yeah, don't get used to it.

38:34.354 --> 38:35.730
[Luke] So much smoke.

38:39.191 --> 38:40.818
What is this stuff?

38:40.901 --> 38:44.196
Eh, little of this, little of that.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.699
[coughing]

38:49.034 --> 38:50.370
Kid was right.

38:51.371 --> 38:52.580
This is war.

38:55.082 --> 38:56.834
And they need him to win it.

38:59.169 --> 39:01.797
We assumed we only had two choices.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.134
Run or fight.

39:05.843 --> 39:06.927
Well...

39:08.804 --> 39:10.640
I found a third option.

39:13.393 --> 39:14.644
[grunts]

39:16.812 --> 39:17.980
Something's wrong.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.569
Luke! Luke!

39:25.237 --> 39:27.114
[panting]

39:36.874 --> 39:40.545
You won't feel any pain, kid. I promise.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.515
You don't have to do this.

39:52.598 --> 39:56.185
Alexandra said I didn't know
what you were. She was right.

39:56.268 --> 39:59.522
You were our weapon.
But they made you theirs.

39:59.605 --> 40:03.609
-What are you talking about?
-You served K'un-Lun as well as you could.

40:03.693 --> 40:06.529
With any luck, you'll see it again.

40:06.612 --> 40:08.363
I would imagine it's beautiful.

40:08.448 --> 40:09.782
Stick...

40:10.575 --> 40:11.701
you need to listen to me.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.836
I wish there was another way, kid.

40:21.919 --> 40:25.465
But there are things in this world
far worse than me.

40:25.548 --> 40:26.757
Stick!

40:29.051 --> 40:32.221
-You can't have him, girl.
-You no longer get to tell me what to do.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.072
[groans]

40:58.163 --> 40:59.665
[groans]

41:05.004 --> 41:07.381
[grunting]

41:07.965 --> 41:09.091
[groans]

41:18.350 --> 41:19.351
[Matt] Elektra!

41:20.728 --> 41:22.021
[panting]

41:23.523 --> 41:25.900
-Listen to me.
-[softly] Matthew.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.820
You don't have to do this. All right?

41:29.904 --> 41:32.948
You don't belong to them.
This is not who you are.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.867
It's good to see you.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.248
[Matt] No!

41:43.918 --> 41:45.169
[groans]

41:46.962 --> 41:48.589
[Jessica grunting]

41:57.181 --> 41:58.015
[groans]

41:59.600 --> 42:00.685
[Luke grunts]

42:02.812 --> 42:04.354
[grunting]

42:09.860 --> 42:11.361
[groans]

42:11.445 --> 42:12.947
[panting]

42:39.682 --> 42:41.391
[car alarm blaring]

43:00.119 --> 43:01.537
[in Japanese] May I join you?

43:02.580 --> 43:05.499
You like to dine alone, I know.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.710
But I feel the need to make amends.

43:09.294 --> 43:10.880
[in English] I thought that entire vintage

43:10.963 --> 43:13.841
had been destroyed
in the fires at Marseille.

43:13.924 --> 43:18.846
You'd be surprised what you can find
at the bottom of the Balearic Sea.

43:21.849 --> 43:22.892
Go on.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.230
I did not originally want
to leave K'un-Lun with you.

43:28.313 --> 43:29.982
Do you remember?

43:30.733 --> 43:34.361
I do. You wanted to stay with the elders.

43:35.445 --> 43:36.614
You wanted to...

43:37.364 --> 43:40.618
[chuckles] use our discoveries
only for good.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.580
It's time for you to know the truth.

43:50.585 --> 43:53.923
I did not want to stay in K'un-Lun
at the time.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.217
I simply did not want to leave with you.

43:59.219 --> 44:00.846
Well, that's no surprise.

44:01.931 --> 44:05.309
Your own strength
was always your singular focus.

44:06.101 --> 44:08.062
It's gotten me this far.

44:11.023 --> 44:13.108
I'm still waiting for my apology.

44:13.776 --> 44:14.819
[cork pops]

44:17.780 --> 44:19.573
I assume you've spoken to Gao.

44:20.365 --> 44:21.366
I have.

44:26.914 --> 44:32.211
Regardless of what has come before,
we were meant to fight this war together.

44:33.628 --> 44:36.381
Of course. Which is why...

44:38.383 --> 44:41.762
I wanted your last meal to be a good one.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.061
You came alone...

44:50.187 --> 44:51.355
to face me?

44:53.023 --> 44:54.024
[tsking]

44:54.108 --> 44:55.609
[in Japanese] Foolish.

44:57.027 --> 45:00.697
[in English] But then you always were...
a lone wolf.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.533
An interesting metaphor.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.412
But if you knew me at all...

45:09.581 --> 45:10.582
you'd know...

45:12.793 --> 45:14.378
I hunt the wolf.

45:14.461 --> 45:15.670
[door opens]

45:30.144 --> 45:31.812
If you knew me at all,

45:31.896 --> 45:34.899
you'd know I always win.

45:41.488 --> 45:43.157
[Murakami in Japanese] In the boardroom...

45:54.251 --> 45:57.212
Mr. Rand, I know I speak for all of us

45:57.296 --> 46:00.424
when I say how nice it is
to have you with us again.

46:00.507 --> 46:02.009
This time, for good.

46:02.092 --> 46:03.218
This war...

46:04.511 --> 46:06.889
[grunts] it isn't over.

46:08.057 --> 46:10.059
[Alexandra] Well,
the thing about war is...

46:10.767 --> 46:14.396
it only works if both sides believe
they're the good guys.

46:15.147 --> 46:19.693
You fight to defeat us.
We fight to get back what was once ours.

46:20.986 --> 46:22.154
And what is it that you want?

46:23.447 --> 46:24.990
To return to K'un-Lun.

46:26.283 --> 46:28.869
That's impossible. You destroyed it.

46:30.412 --> 46:31.413
I saw.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.541
You saw what you wanted to see.

46:36.210 --> 46:40.547
The truth is, you and I,
we're not so different.

46:41.340 --> 46:43.425
We share the same home.

46:43.508 --> 46:46.261
We both want nothing more
than to return to it.

46:46.846 --> 46:50.975
And now, without death
standing in our way,

46:51.058 --> 46:53.894
I believe we can, together.

46:53.978 --> 46:54.979
No.

46:55.729 --> 46:58.858
[scoffs] We are not the same.

47:00.109 --> 47:02.236
-I know.
-[breath trembling]

47:02.319 --> 47:03.487
But in the end...

47:05.572 --> 47:06.866
and this is the end...

47:07.574 --> 47:09.994
you'll do what everyone else does for me.

47:11.411 --> 47:12.579
You'll serve.

47:18.710 --> 47:19.920
[grunting]

47:21.380 --> 47:23.006
Where are you taking me?

47:25.092 --> 47:28.637
Well, now that he's taken care of,
we can proceed as planned.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.015
[in Japanese] Little has gone as planned.

47:31.723 --> 47:37.146
Yes, we have the Iron Fist,
but at what cost?

47:37.229 --> 47:40.232
[in English] Is any cost too great
for our survival?

47:40.315 --> 47:42.401
When it's the life of one of ours, yes.

47:42.484 --> 47:44.111
[Gao] We must look to the future.

47:44.194 --> 47:46.488
It's our greatest asset.

47:46.571 --> 47:50.325
[Bakuto] From this moment forth,
our sole focus is to secure the substance.

47:50.409 --> 47:52.702
Before his allies come for him.

47:53.495 --> 47:55.247
We cannot underestimate them.

47:55.330 --> 47:57.416
Do not underestimate me!

48:01.836 --> 48:03.380
Kill Luke Cage.

48:03.463 --> 48:04.881
Kill Jessica Jones.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.676
And the Devil of Hell's Kitchen,
whoever he is.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.721
I'm so happy you're all
on board with the plan.

48:11.805 --> 48:15.642
But let me remind you,
I neutralized our enemies.

48:15.725 --> 48:18.062
I brought you the Iron Fist.

48:18.145 --> 48:21.648
I was able to keep the most important
operation in our history running

48:21.731 --> 48:24.359
while you succumbed to chaos and conflict.

48:24.443 --> 48:28.613
I have proven myself to be
the one and only true leader--

48:36.580 --> 48:37.872
