Excuse us.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.871

<i>Our family is cursed, Cole.</i>

00:19.743 --> 00:21.142

has occurred.

00:23.814 --> 00:25.213
You are not selling
your grandparents' house.

00:25.215 --> 00:26.415
[Alison]
The house is in escrow.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.049
It's done.

00:28.051 --> 00:29.284
[Alison]
You're really late.

00:29.286 --> 00:30.786
My fault.
Totally my fault.

00:30.788 --> 00:33.388
Ah, Eden.
Where's the turkey?

00:33.390 --> 00:35.123
Shit, I knew
we forgot something.

00:35.125 --> 00:36.925
- I'll go get it right now.

00:48.203 --> 00:49.904
<i>I was trying to get you
out of my house,</i>

00:49.906 --> 00:51.772
and as soon as
you walked out that door,

00:51.774 --> 00:52.773
I wanted you back.

You're on

03:24.456 --> 03:26.222
Yes, I am.

03:26.224 --> 03:29.392
Um, but it's, um, Tinder.

03:29.394 --> 03:30.393
You know that?

03:30.395 --> 03:32.462
Yeah, I've heard of it.

03:32.464 --> 03:33.896
It's my first time.

03:33.898 --> 03:35.598
My daughter set the whole thing
up for me, so...

03:35.600 --> 03:37.265
- How old's your daughter?
- 18.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.834
That makes sense.

03:38.836 --> 03:42.337
Tinder is more of
a hookup site for millennials.

03:42.339 --> 03:44.306
You should try match.com.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.441
That's usually where
the divorcées hang out.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.412
- Thanks for the tip.
- No problem.

03:50.414 --> 03:51.614
Can I get you
anything else?

03:51.616 --> 03:53.115
Nope, this is great.

03:53.117 --> 03:54.617
Just the check, and here,
you can just run that.

03:54.619 --> 03:55.751
Sure.

03:59.989 --> 04:00.989
Hey.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.660
Do I know you?

04:07.630 --> 04:10.732
Yeah.

I operated on your son.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.571
- God. Dr. Ullah!
- Yeah.

04:17.572 --> 04:19.007
I'm sorry.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.473
It's such a different context.
Hi.

04:20.475 --> 04:21.642
How's he doing?

04:21.644 --> 04:22.976
He's better.

04:22.978 --> 04:25.012
Um, he gained six pounds
since the surgery.

04:25.014 --> 04:26.647
- That's great.
- Mm-hmm.

04:26.649 --> 04:27.881
I've been meaning
to follow up with you,

04:27.883 --> 04:29.182
just to get you
some sort of thank-you.

04:29.184 --> 04:30.617
Come on,
that isn't necessary.

04:30.619 --> 04:31.785
- It's my job.
- No, but I want to.

04:31.787 --> 04:33.120
I just, I really...
I wasn't sure

04:33.122 --> 04:37.124
what surgeons generally like.

04:37.126 --> 04:38.458
Alcohol.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.628
O... kay.

04:41.630 --> 04:43.530
Do you prefer red or white?

04:43.532 --> 04:46.065
- I prefer whiskey.
- Okay.

04:46.067 --> 04:48.000
Wine doesn't get you drunk
fast enough.

04:48.002 --> 04:49.635
Right.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.370
Whiskey, okay.

04:51.372 --> 04:53.472
Should I send that
to the hospital, or...

04:53.474 --> 04:54.907
No.

04:57.010 --> 04:59.045
You got a pen?
I'll give you my home address.

05:02.849 --> 05:05.685
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

05:05.687 --> 05:06.719
Okay.

05:06.721 --> 05:08.853
It's 322 Lenox Avenue.

05:08.855 --> 05:10.755
- You live in Harlem?
- Yep.

05:10.757 --> 05:12.391
What are you doing
all the way out here?

05:12.393 --> 05:14.426
Well, I'm on call tonight
at Brooklyn Central,

05:14.428 --> 05:15.760
but I was worried
about the weather,

05:15.762 --> 05:17.729
so decided to come
hang out down here

05:17.731 --> 05:18.930
in case I have to go in.

05:18.932 --> 05:21.032
I'll have another.

05:23.102 --> 05:24.436
How much have you
had to drink?

05:24.438 --> 05:27.206
This?
Oh, don't worry.

05:27.208 --> 05:29.174
This just loosens my joints.

05:36.415 --> 05:37.849
Hey, I hope
you don't mind.

05:37.851 --> 05:40.051
I couldn't help
eavesdropping.

a Tinder date?

[writes on paper]

05:45.025 --> 05:46.457
Yep.

05:46.459 --> 05:49.894
So married women
do use Tinder.

05:49.896 --> 05:51.696
- Fascinating.
- I'm not married.

05:51.698 --> 05:53.531
- You're not?
- Not anymore.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.532
- I'm shocked to hear that.
- Oh, really?

05:55.534 --> 05:57.768
I find that hard to believe
since the last time you saw me

05:57.770 --> 05:59.703
you had a front-row seat
to my divorce.

05:59.705 --> 06:01.138
Is that what was
happening there?

06:01.140 --> 06:02.706
Yes, that's what was happening.

06:02.708 --> 06:04.108
We were in the middle
of a horrible litigation,

06:04.110 --> 06:05.743
and he... it was...

06:07.846 --> 06:10.147
...well, bad,
but it's over now.

06:10.149 --> 06:13.283
Thank God.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.417
Very nice to see you.

06:14.419 --> 06:15.753
And I will, um...

06:15.755 --> 06:17.654
I'll get you that whiskey
straightaway.

06:17.656 --> 06:19.756
- You're leaving? Why?
- Yeah.

06:19.758 --> 06:22.859
Because I have to get
back to my kids.

06:22.861 --> 06:24.494
'Cause it's a little windy?

06:24.496 --> 06:26.996

we just got an emergency alert.

06:26.998 --> 06:30.867
The mayor is closing down
the subways at 9 p.m. tonight.

06:30.869 --> 06:32.201
My manager just said
we need to kick you all out,

06:32.203 --> 06:33.503
so we can go home.

06:33.505 --> 06:34.704
[Helen]
Okay, well, thanks again.

06:34.706 --> 06:36.706
And, uh, nice to see you.

06:36.708 --> 06:37.641
Wait.

06:39.276 --> 06:42.177
How about leaving me
your number?

06:44.514 --> 06:45.847
Yeah...

06:45.849 --> 06:47.683
[waitress]
This is great, you guys,

06:47.685 --> 06:49.117
but can you do
this part outside?

06:49.119 --> 06:50.452
[Vik]
Sure.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.125
[mouthing words]

07:02.198 --> 07:04.499
So can I have it?

07:04.501 --> 07:07.702
Your number.

07:07.704 --> 07:09.271
You're not gonna, like,

07:09.273 --> 07:11.106
ask me out on a date
or anything, are you?

07:11.108 --> 07:12.373
I was thinking about it.

07:12.375 --> 07:13.975
It's a bad idea.

07:13.977 --> 07:16.411
You'll accept a date
from some rando on the Internet,

07:16.413 --> 07:19.147
but you won't
go out with me?

07:19.149 --> 07:21.182
I mean,
what is a date, really?

07:21.184 --> 07:23.517
It's just an interview
for sex.

07:23.519 --> 07:27.087
Okay.

07:27.089 --> 07:29.123
Would you like
to have sex with me?

07:33.661 --> 07:35.595
Sure.

07:47.007 --> 07:48.407
Hi, guys.

07:48.409 --> 07:50.243
Hi, Mom.
How was your meeting?

07:50.245 --> 07:53.046
It was good.

07:53.048 --> 07:54.047
Where's Martin?

07:54.049 --> 07:56.015
[Trevor]
In his room.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.917
And did Whitney
leave already?

07:57.919 --> 08:00.586
Yeah, Chrissy came
to pick her up.

08:00.588 --> 08:02.388
Did they say
where they were going?

08:02.390 --> 08:04.390
No.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.227
[Helen]
Okay,

08:07.229 --> 08:11.664
I'm gonna go,
um, check the basement

08:11.666 --> 08:14.600
and make sure there aren't
any leaks from the storm.

08:14.602 --> 08:16.268
Is it raining yet?

08:21.575 --> 08:24.510

09:10.054 --> 09:12.623
Can I offer you something?

09:12.625 --> 09:14.958
Just some water
would be great.

09:14.960 --> 09:15.893
Great.

09:17.862 --> 09:20.798
[phone buzzing]

09:22.666 --> 09:24.500
Do you mind if I just...
it's the hospital.

09:24.502 --> 09:27.470
Oh, no, go ahead.

09:27.472 --> 09:31.173
This is Dr. Ullah.

09:31.175 --> 09:33.776
Who?

09:33.778 --> 09:35.110
Oh, yeah, okay.

09:35.112 --> 09:37.046
Put her through.
[mouths words]

09:39.983 --> 09:44.386
Hi, Mrs. Gatewood,
how's Kim feeling?

09:44.388 --> 09:46.789
What?

09:46.791 --> 09:48.524
No, no.

09:48.526 --> 09:50.292
You have nothing
to worry about.

09:50.294 --> 09:52.561
The hospital has
backup generators.

09:52.563 --> 09:54.696
They will...

09:54.698 --> 09:55.998
Well...

09:56.000 --> 09:58.133
No, none of the machines
will stop working,

09:58.135 --> 10:00.502
I promise,
especially not the ones

10:00.504 --> 10:05.107
connected to
your daughter's kidney.

10:05.109 --> 10:07.609
I know.
I know you are.

10:07.611 --> 10:12.114
That's perfectly natural,
but I promise you have...

10:12.116 --> 10:15.117
Well... but you have...

10:18.054 --> 10:20.356
You have nothing
to worry about.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.191
You guys just hang in there
for the night,

10:22.193 --> 10:24.292
and I'll see you all
in the morning for rounds.

10:24.294 --> 10:26.995
Okay?
Oh...

10:28.497 --> 10:30.431
You too.

10:32.468 --> 10:34.469
Me too.

10:34.471 --> 10:37.171
Yeah, you too.

10:37.173 --> 10:39.307
Okay, bye.

10:39.309 --> 10:41.476

10:47.816 --> 10:48.883

Dr. Ullah?

10:48.885 --> 10:50.551
- Martin, my man.
- Hi.

10:50.553 --> 10:51.952
[Vik]
What's happening?

10:51.954 --> 10:55.555
What are you doing here?

10:55.557 --> 10:57.190

to introduce you?

22:37.346 --> 22:38.379
I wouldn't know
what to say to him.

22:38.381 --> 22:39.947
- Aw...
- There he is.

22:39.949 --> 22:41.516

Oh, thank you.

22:41.518 --> 22:43.518

22:43.520 --> 22:44.818

22:44.820 --> 22:46.220
All right.

22:46.222 --> 22:48.622
The new bad boy
of American letters.

22:48.624 --> 22:50.457
- Mr. Callahan.
- [laughs]

22:50.459 --> 22:51.992
Rodney, come on.

22:51.994 --> 22:53.660
So you having a good time?
Anything you need?

22:53.662 --> 22:55.595
No, no.
I got everything, thanks.

22:55.597 --> 22:57.264
You got everything.
You got Eden here.

22:57.266 --> 22:58.432
Hi, sweetheart.

22:58.434 --> 22:59.533
How about just one slap?

22:59.535 --> 23:00.734
Go for it, big boy.
Whoo!

23:00.736 --> 23:02.102
Ooh, I love that girl!

23:02.104 --> 23:03.270
Come on, sit down.

23:03.272 --> 23:05.605
So let me tell you,

23:05.607 --> 23:08.708
I fucking love your novel.

23:08.710 --> 23:10.244
But you know
what else I love?

23:10.246 --> 23:12.779
The shit that
you have stirred up,

23:12.781 --> 23:15.114
some people calling you
the voice of your generation,

23:15.116 --> 23:17.884
others saying that the book
is nothing but porn.

23:17.886 --> 23:19.920
I mean, do you know
how long it has been

23:19.922 --> 23:21.922
since someone dared
to mix high art

23:21.924 --> 23:24.324
with good old-fashioned fucking?

23:24.326 --> 23:26.693
Hmm? Henry Miller?
Nabokov?

23:26.695 --> 23:28.862
But nowadays, most authors,

23:28.864 --> 23:31.397
they're scared shitless
to do something like that.

23:31.399 --> 23:33.266
I mean, political correctness

23:33.268 --> 23:36.903
has turned us all into
a nation of fucking pussies.

23:36.905 --> 23:39.005
[laughing]

23:39.007 --> 23:41.875
When I used to hang around
with Norman Mailer,

23:41.877 --> 23:44.877
I produced two movies
based on his novels, you know?

23:44.879 --> 23:47.245
He stirred up
the same kind of shit,

23:47.247 --> 23:51.016
but that's how you knew
that the books mattered.

23:51.018 --> 23:53.486
Here, try this.
I hear it's very good.

23:53.488 --> 23:55.153
You want some?

23:55.155 --> 23:56.421
[Eden]
No, thanks. Go ahead.

23:56.423 --> 23:58.223
[Rodney]
I'm telling you, Noah,

23:58.225 --> 24:01.326
Norman would've
loved your book.

24:01.328 --> 24:03.596
You're his, uh...

24:03.598 --> 24:05.564
You're like
his literary son.

24:05.566 --> 24:07.633
[chuckles]
Wow, thanks.

24:07.635 --> 24:09.234
I, uh...

24:09.236 --> 24:11.069
I... look,
I-I never thought

24:11.071 --> 24:14.272
I'd meet a producer in Hollywood
who understood my work so well.

24:14.274 --> 24:15.808
[Rodney]
Yeah, you know why that is.

24:15.810 --> 24:17.742
'Cause we're not
in Hollywood, yeah.

24:17.744 --> 24:19.177
- [laughs]
- Now listen, now listen.

24:19.179 --> 24:20.912
Just one thing
I want to discuss with you.

24:20.914 --> 24:22.247
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, please, anything.

24:22.249 --> 24:23.581
Look, like I said before,

24:23.583 --> 24:25.583
I love everything
about your novel,

24:25.585 --> 24:27.019
except that ending.

24:27.021 --> 24:29.488
I mean, it's so dark,
and I love dark,

24:29.490 --> 24:32.624
but come on, shit, the guy
mows her down in his car?

24:32.626 --> 24:35.727
Would you consider,
for the movie...

24:35.729 --> 24:38.096
well, let me put it to you
this way...

24:38.098 --> 24:41.233
when we have Jennifer Lawrence
playing Lana,

24:41.235 --> 24:43.402
she's not gonna end up

24:43.404 --> 24:45.170
getting dragged
under a fucking minivan, okay?

24:45.172 --> 24:46.938
Mm-mm.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.340
So what would you think of doing
something a little more upbeat?

24:49.342 --> 24:51.242
Maybe romantic?

24:52.744 --> 24:54.445
Like the two of them
sitting down to dinner

24:54.447 --> 24:56.680
with an unimaginable secret
between them?

24:56.682 --> 24:58.482
Ooh! I love this guy.

24:58.484 --> 24:59.950
He reads my mind.

24:59.952 --> 25:02.353
No, that was... that was
my original i... that's...

25:02.355 --> 25:04.621
- I fucking love your idea.
- Yeah.

25:04.623 --> 25:06.023
Why didn't I think of that?
That's a great idea.

25:06.025 --> 25:07.191
You wanna hear
another good idea?

25:07.193 --> 25:10.361
- Yes.
- [Max] Noah? Really?

25:10.363 --> 25:11.895
Hey, Max, what...

25:11.897 --> 25:13.030
What the fuck are
you doing here?

25:13.032 --> 25:14.165
I could ask you
the same question.

25:14.167 --> 25:15.466
Hey, come on,
hurricane party?

25:15.468 --> 25:16.667
You know I can't say no.

25:16.669 --> 25:18.402
[Max]
Isn't this place incredible?

25:18.404 --> 25:20.704
My real estate agent
sold this house to the host.

25:20.706 --> 25:22.572
Some rich Hollywood asshole.

25:22.574 --> 25:24.907
Hey, um, Rodney,
this is Max.

25:24.909 --> 25:27.043
Max, this is the Rodney,
the, uh, host.

25:27.045 --> 25:30.080
Ah, shit.
Sorry, man.

25:30.082 --> 25:31.147
Sorry.

25:31.149 --> 25:32.182
Max Cadman.

25:32.184 --> 25:34.817
Rich Wall Street asshole.

25:34.819 --> 25:37.220
It takes one to know one,
I guess.

25:37.222 --> 25:39.055
[Max]
Ain't that the truth.

25:39.057 --> 25:41.558
Those poor suckers in town
battening down for the storm,

25:41.560 --> 25:43.326
worried for their lives.

25:43.328 --> 25:45.628
Look, guys like you and me,
Rodney, we know the only way

25:45.630 --> 25:48.965
to survive a hurricane...
wall-to-wall models.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.800
Hey, we're in the middle
of a meeting.

25:50.802 --> 25:52.135
Who?

25:52.137 --> 25:53.868
You... you and Rodney?

25:53.870 --> 25:55.471
- No shit.
- Yeah, no shit.

25:55.473 --> 25:58.840
Rodney's gonna produce
the movie of my book, so...

25:58.842 --> 26:01.143
That's great. Yeah.
Don't let me interrupt you guys.

26:01.145 --> 26:02.611
Keep... keep talking.

26:02.613 --> 26:05.447
I'm gonna do a little work
right here.

26:05.449 --> 26:07.249
[chuckles]
You know, actually,

26:07.251 --> 26:08.450
if I could put in
my two cents,

26:08.452 --> 26:10.452
I've been giving
a lot of thought to,

26:10.454 --> 26:12.221
uh, the role of Alison.

26:12.223 --> 26:13.388
What do you call her
in the book, again?

26:13.390 --> 26:15.190
The, uh, whatever.

26:15.192 --> 26:17.559
Anyway, stick with me here,
little outside the box.

26:17.561 --> 26:20.395
As Alison, Sasha Grey.

26:20.397 --> 26:22.364
How hot would that be?

26:22.366 --> 26:25.233
[snorting]
Mm, yes.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.801
You know who she is,
right?

26:26.803 --> 26:30.304
[Max] No, you don't.
You are in for a treat, Rodney.

26:30.306 --> 26:32.774
Sasha Grey came out
of the adult cinema world.

26:32.776 --> 26:35.076
Now she's actually
completely legit.

26:35.078 --> 26:36.745
She's a beautiful actress,
and with her experience,

26:36.747 --> 26:37.946
she could kill
in the sex scenes.

26:37.948 --> 26:39.413
Come on, you need to go.
Let's go.

26:39.415 --> 26:40.649
- Max, come on, let's go.
- Why?

26:40.651 --> 26:42.083
- You gotta go.
- Jesus fucking Christ.

26:42.085 --> 26:43.718
That was quite rude.

26:43.720 --> 26:47.022
[Max] Good talking to you,
Rodney. Why do I have to leave?

26:47.024 --> 26:49.557
I'm trying to close
a fucking important deal,

26:49.559 --> 26:51.660
and you're fucking it up,
that's why.

26:54.095 --> 26:55.463
I'm fucking you up?

26:55.465 --> 26:57.532
Yes.

26:57.534 --> 27:00.401
Maybe you forgot,
buddy, that, um,

27:00.403 --> 27:01.702
I'm the guy that
lent you 50 grand

27:01.704 --> 27:03.103
when you were fucking up
your own life...

27:03.105 --> 27:04.838
- I know, Max.
- ...which you never paid back.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.140
- [Jake] Excuse me, everyone!
- You said it was a gift.

27:06.142 --> 27:07.208
Can I have your attention,
please?

27:07.210 --> 27:08.609
I didn't push it because I know

27:08.611 --> 27:10.278
you didn't have
any fucking money, right,

27:10.280 --> 27:11.546
'cause you wrote a book, right,
and I run a hedge fund.

27:11.548 --> 27:12.780
Excuse me.
According to the police blotter,

27:12.782 --> 27:14.582
they may start
shutting down the roads,

27:14.584 --> 27:17.751
so anyone who's not waiting out
the storm should start leaving.

27:17.753 --> 27:19.487
Uh, I gotta get back
to business.

27:19.489 --> 27:22.955
Business, is that... is that what
you're calling it now?

27:22.957 --> 27:25.758
Noah, the thing is, you were
supposed to be the good guy.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.994
Right? I was supposed
to be the asshole.

27:27.996 --> 27:30.797
Oh, you're still
the asshole, Max.

27:33.201 --> 27:34.701
I'm sorry about that.

27:34.703 --> 27:37.470
How do you know
that unpleasant human being?

27:37.472 --> 27:39.806
Uh...

27:39.808 --> 27:42.075
he was... he was a friend
of my ex-wife.

27:44.945 --> 27:47.380

- Sure.
