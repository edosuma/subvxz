WEBVTT

00:01.294 --> 00:02.454
Nathan: Previously on Haven...

00:02.545 --> 00:03.955
Dwight: Charlotte might be able
to create a vaccine

00:04.046 --> 00:05.172
against the contagion.

00:05.256 --> 00:07.622
If Charlotte's successful, it could lead
to a cure for the Troubles.

00:07.717 --> 00:10.675
- CDC denies having
any personnel in Haven.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.297
Dwight: Kirk.
What are you doing here?

00:12.388 --> 00:13.673
If your Trouble activates--

00:13.764 --> 00:15.550
Go home before you catch sick.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.848
- I can't breathe.
Nathan: None of us can.

00:17.935 --> 00:18.924
- It's Kirk.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.556
His Trouble draws the oxygen

00:20.646 --> 00:21.931
out of the air around him.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.227
And we're losing oxygen fast.

00:26.319 --> 00:27.900
Mara: Your friends are dying.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.649
Be a hero.
End the contagion.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.071
- Nathan.
(coughing)

00:32.158 --> 00:33.864
- Parker.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.236
You're still sick.

00:35.328 --> 00:37.068
How is that possible?

00:37.163 --> 00:38.699
- I want to fix you.

00:38.789 --> 00:39.778
- And I'm supposed to believe

00:39.874 --> 00:41.580
you're not planning on
gutting me because?

00:41.667 --> 00:42.656
- It's like you said.

00:42.752 --> 00:43.832
We're on our own.

00:48.925 --> 00:51.632
(chatter, door opens)

00:53.971 --> 00:55.802
- You used to bring me coffee.

00:55.890 --> 00:57.471
- Fresh pot brewing right now.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.179
Pete Palak's body was just found

01:01.270 --> 01:03.556
in a dumpster
outside the hospital.

01:03.648 --> 01:05.513
- Pete's dead?

01:05.608 --> 01:06.597
- Stabbed.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.693
Gloria puts T.O.D. At the same
time the contagion ended.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.363
- What are you thinking?

01:14.450 --> 01:15.439
- Duke.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.406
That would explain
why he's gone AWOL.

01:19.497 --> 01:21.112
- Mara has to be behind this.

01:22.959 --> 01:24.369
Do you think that he's with her?

01:24.460 --> 01:27.577
- There's no way Mara got off
duke's boat without his help.

01:27.672 --> 01:28.661
(chuckles)

01:29.507 --> 01:30.496
(coughing)

01:32.426 --> 01:33.415
- Hey.

01:35.346 --> 01:37.257
You shouldn't still be sick.

01:37.348 --> 01:38.337
- I'm fine.

01:39.225 --> 01:40.806
People get the flu, Nathan.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.804
- It's not flu season.

01:42.895 --> 01:44.726
- So you do think
it's about the split?

01:44.814 --> 01:47.851
That the reason I'm sick
is because I shouldn't be here?

01:47.942 --> 01:49.478
- No.
- That I'm not real?

01:49.568 --> 01:50.557
- No.
I did not--

01:50.653 --> 01:51.642
I didn't say that.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.147
- Okay, good.

01:53.239 --> 01:54.979
Because for once in my life

01:55.074 --> 01:56.154
I am my own person,

01:56.242 --> 01:59.200
and except for a little cough,

01:59.287 --> 02:00.697
I feel great.

02:00.788 --> 02:01.903
- Parker, hey...

02:03.374 --> 02:05.080
You...

02:05.167 --> 02:07.158
you are the realest person
I know.

02:08.504 --> 02:11.120
- More real than me, most days.
- Well.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.921
- But...

02:13.009 --> 02:15.125
what if losing your immunity
to the Troubles

02:15.219 --> 02:17.426
wasn't the only effect
that the split had on you?

02:17.513 --> 02:21.756
J‘J‘

02:21.851 --> 02:23.011
(birds calling)

02:23.102 --> 02:25.093
Duke: This journal is not helping!

02:25.187 --> 02:26.222
(thudding)

02:26.314 --> 02:27.520
- Wow, you're cranky.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.025
Absorbing that contagion Trouble

02:30.109 --> 02:32.725
must really be
stirring things up in there.

02:34.113 --> 02:36.820
- You said
you were gonna fix me.

02:36.907 --> 02:40.035
- Yes, but I also said
I need Aether to do it.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.531
- And to open up
one of your thinnies, right?

02:42.621 --> 02:44.703
Pretty sure I know what your
priority's gonna be.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.451
- Why don't you
just vent something?

02:46.542 --> 02:48.703
It might put you in
a better mood.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.295
(scoffs)
- I can't.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.494
- What's wrong?

02:53.507 --> 02:54.792
- I have been...

02:56.260 --> 02:58.046
through every page
of this journal...

02:58.137 --> 02:59.126
(thuds)

03:00.139 --> 03:01.549
And it seems
that the only Troubles

03:01.640 --> 03:04.928
left for me to let out are anything
but manageable.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.225
- Mass casualties, huh?

03:08.564 --> 03:09.553
Well...

03:10.524 --> 03:13.561
you can't say
I wasn't ambitious back then.

03:13.652 --> 03:14.641
(chuckles)

03:14.737 --> 03:15.726
- Yeah.

03:16.822 --> 03:17.811
Ambitious.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.189
(chair thuds)

03:21.535 --> 03:22.524
And cruel.

03:23.454 --> 03:26.571
You didn't care about
a single person's life

03:26.665 --> 03:27.916
that your Troubles ruined.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.913
So why should I believe
all of a sudden

03:31.003 --> 03:32.834
that you give a
damn about helping me?

03:32.922 --> 03:35.379
- Because helping you helps me.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.207
- Oh.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.006
I'm not immune to your Trouble,
remember?

03:43.182 --> 03:44.171
- Mm-hmm.

03:45.684 --> 03:46.673
Right.

03:48.396 --> 03:51.103
So you're just in this
to save your own skin?

03:51.190 --> 03:52.270
- Well...

03:52.358 --> 03:54.189
- Hey, at least it's honest.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.143
Almost makes me like you.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.227
- Good.

04:00.116 --> 04:02.823
Now stop sulking
and go find that damn Aether.

04:15.506 --> 04:16.791
Kirk: Hey.

04:16.882 --> 04:17.871
We're gonna talk.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.000
(beeping)

04:22.096 --> 04:23.302
- Call Dwight Hendrickson.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.220
computer: Dwight Hendrickson.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.513
Dialing.
(phone dialing)

04:29.562 --> 04:30.551
- Morning.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.095
Kirk, right?

04:34.984 --> 04:36.315
Dwight: Charlotte?

04:36.402 --> 04:38.017
- Did, uh, Dwight send you here?

04:38.112 --> 04:39.773
- I'm here for myself.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.479
They're saying you made a cure.

04:41.574 --> 04:43.815
- I heard about what happened
the other day at the hospital.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.696
- Lady, | suffocated
three people I wasn't even near.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.698
- That's terrible.
- Yes, it is.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.905
So fix me.
- Look, I'm sorry.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.080
I don't have a cure.

04:52.168 --> 04:53.328
Not now.

04:53.419 --> 04:54.784
I might have found a gene that

04:54.879 --> 04:56.244
could be associated
with the Troubles.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.839
But if you consent to tests--

04:57.923 --> 05:00.209
- I don't want a test.

05:00.301 --> 05:02.292
I already know what I am.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.671
- Okay, sir,
I'm just-I'm trying to--

05:03.762 --> 05:06.970
- Bull!
You need to do more.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.888
- Kirk.
Step back.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.091
- She's jerking us around.

05:10.186 --> 05:11.551
Can't you see that?

05:11.645 --> 05:13.181
- Leave now,

05:13.272 --> 05:14.478
under your own power

05:14.565 --> 05:15.554
or mine.

05:18.611 --> 05:19.600
(scoffs)

05:22.573 --> 05:23.688
(sighs)

05:23.782 --> 05:25.283
- I'm glad you called.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.652
- Yeah, me too.

05:26.744 --> 05:27.733
- He's losing it.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.786
Sometimes hope, it makes people,
I don't know, a little crazy.

05:30.873 --> 05:31.908
- I don't know about hope.

05:31.999 --> 05:35.833
I feel like I'm inspiring
frustration more than anything.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.126
- Not with me.

05:39.548 --> 05:42.085
- That sample of Aether
you gave me,

05:42.176 --> 05:43.882
I'm almost through with it.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.379
Could you get me some more?

05:45.471 --> 05:47.757
I'd like to compare it
to the DNA marker,

05:47.848 --> 05:49.964
see if there's
any commonalities.

05:50.059 --> 05:52.050
- I think I can do that.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.938
Why don't I bring it by when I...

05:55.022 --> 05:56.808
pick you up for dinner?

05:58.776 --> 06:00.391
- Dinner...

06:00.486 --> 06:01.475
- Gotta eat.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.686
- Gotta eat.

06:06.742 --> 06:07.731
man: Give me some change
for the meter.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.737
woman: There's
a spot around the corner.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.159
(dog barking)

06:11.247 --> 06:13.989
woman: No, I'm not crying
in front of my coworkers.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.290
They're in the back.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.914
Look, I need the extra shifts.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.505
I need the money.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.538
(sniffles)

06:22.758 --> 06:24.544
Please, she can afford it.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.211
My rent was due last week.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.889
Look,
I can't keep living this way.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.518
I don't know how much longer
I can hold it together.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.354
J‘J‘

06:40.192 --> 06:42.899
(gasping)

06:42.987 --> 06:44.272
(screaming)

06:46.073 --> 06:47.062
(thuds)

06:48.409 --> 06:52.493
J‘J‘

07:19.231 --> 07:23.395
J‘J‘

07:25.904 --> 07:27.644
(shop bells jingle)

07:27.740 --> 07:30.197
- You're supposed to check in,
Vince.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.820
Your contacts have
any word on Duke and Mara?

07:33.078 --> 07:37.242
- Although I don't approve
of his travel companion,

07:37.333 --> 07:39.324
maybe Duke Crocker
had the right idea.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.283
- Taking off with the woman
who created the Troubles?

07:41.378 --> 07:43.243
- To get out of Haven
before Charlotte Cross

07:43.339 --> 07:47.082
brings the wrath of whoever she
works for down on our heads.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.666
- We know who she works for.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.171
The CDC, I checked her out.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.377
- You checked?

07:51.472 --> 07:53.679
Well, I looked into it myself,

07:53.766 --> 07:56.508
and nothing official
supports the CDC

07:56.602 --> 07:59.844
being dispatched to
or conducting business here.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.144
- She's off the record.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.812
Sometimes an operative
makes a full assessment

08:02.900 --> 08:04.436
before calling in a whole unit.

08:04.526 --> 08:08.360
- You realize you trusted her
with our most ancient secrets?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.653
- She hasn't told anyone
back at the CDC

08:10.741 --> 08:12.823
what she's working on here.
(Vince scoffs)

08:16.538 --> 08:17.948
I just buried my sister.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.905
How many people have
you lost, Vince?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.706
We keep beating our
head against the supernatural,

08:21.794 --> 08:23.284
but what if it's just science?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.538
I know in my gut
that Charlotte Cross is here

08:27.633 --> 08:29.874
to help save this town
from the Troubles.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.674
Why are you so sure she's not?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.391
- I should be laying out copy
for tomorroW's paper.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.516
(door opens)

08:47.611 --> 08:49.727
(chatter)

08:49.822 --> 08:53.314
- It's like she was
a life-sized Mrs. Potato Head

08:53.409 --> 08:55.741
with loose parts and fewer
sartorial choices.

08:56.412 --> 08:57.572
- Blood?
Cut marks?

08:57.663 --> 08:59.745
- No.
I smell a Trouble,

08:59.832 --> 09:02.448
but I will be shipping a piece
over to Dr. Fancypants

09:02.543 --> 09:04.408
per order of the chief.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.084
- Dwight has Charlotte
checking up on you?

09:06.171 --> 09:08.833
- Oh, she's testing
subjects for her DNA marker.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.257
Sounds like a make-work
project to me.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.167
- You don't like her?

09:14.263 --> 09:16.049
- She can have the left foot.

09:16.140 --> 09:17.129
There's plenty.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.759
But if I was 30 years younger,

09:18.851 --> 09:22.514
she'd have to come down here
and take it from me.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.148
She's a skinny
thing, too, isn't she?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.517
Too skinny, it looks weird.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.441
- You think it hurt?

09:29.528 --> 09:30.859
To break apart like that?

09:33.282 --> 09:36.115
- We're still investigating
what exactly happened here.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.533
- Detective,
I know all about the Troubles.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.279
Could Marcy have infected me
or my daughter?

09:42.374 --> 09:44.581
- It doesn't, uh,
really work like that.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.461
But you said that Marcy was having
some money problems?

09:49.548 --> 09:52.164
- She was so desperate,
she asked for a pay advance.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.669
-Okay... and did you
give it to her?

09:53.761 --> 09:54.750
- No.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.301
People can't fight
their demons with a crutch.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.219
They need a sword.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.047
(coughs)

10:01.894 --> 10:02.883
That's a...

10:05.105 --> 10:07.016
You have
some strong convictions.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.483
- I thought Marcy was
a decent woman,

10:08.567 --> 10:10.273
but she's one of those people.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.227
She could have warned us:
me, my daughter, my employees.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.357
- Your daughter?

10:18.452 --> 10:20.238
- Samantha.
The tall one.

10:20.329 --> 10:23.196
- And the other girl
is Grace, the cashier.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.621
Have you called her parents?

10:24.708 --> 10:26.915
She seems like she's having
a pretty hard time with this.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.709
- Well, she found a dead body.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.413
I'm just thankful
it wasn't Samantha.

10:32.508 --> 10:33.964
- They seem pretty close.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.040
- They're dating.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.710
I'm glad they have each other,

10:37.805 --> 10:41.138
even though I don't approve of
consorting with the employees.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.260
(coughs)

10:42.351 --> 10:43.340
Sorry.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.300
(coughs)
- Do you need to sit down?

10:45.395 --> 10:46.976
(coughing)
- I'm okay.

10:47.064 --> 10:48.349
Can I get a water?

10:48.440 --> 10:49.429
- Yeah.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.480
(coughing continues)

10:57.074 --> 10:59.030
- Parker, what is it?

11:00.452 --> 11:03.364
- The victim, Marcy, she was
having some financial problems,

11:03.455 --> 11:07.698
so I think her Trouble kicked in
when her boss, the bigot,

11:07.793 --> 11:09.454
refused to give her
the help that she needed.

11:09.545 --> 11:10.910
- That's not what I meant.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.710
- What?
It's gonna be an open and shut case.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.709
I mean, how often do we get
one of those?

11:14.800 --> 11:15.789
- You're sick.

11:16.927 --> 11:17.916
Tell me.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.972
How bad is it?

11:22.724 --> 11:24.225
- It comes and goes.

11:25.561 --> 11:26.550
(exhales)

11:26.645 --> 11:29.728
- I think it's time
for you to see Dr. Cross.

11:29.815 --> 11:30.804
(exhales)

11:32.025 --> 11:34.562
(birds calling, insects chirping)

11:38.156 --> 11:39.145
(phone ringing)

11:41.451 --> 11:43.658
(grumbling)

11:46.623 --> 11:50.582
J‘J‘

11:51.503 --> 11:55.587
(ringing continues)

12:02.556 --> 12:03.545
- Good morning.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.806
- I knew I couldn't trust you.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.976
J‘J‘

12:12.858 --> 12:14.348
Mara: Still so cranky.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.768
You do realize
I left you napping

12:17.863 --> 12:19.649
when I could have left you dead?

12:19.740 --> 12:20.946
- What a surprise.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.232
Why didn't you?

12:23.327 --> 12:24.942
- I've been thinking
about what you said,

12:25.037 --> 12:28.575
about me only
looking out for myself.

12:28.665 --> 12:31.452
You let people think
that about you, too.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.205
But you sacrifice for the ones
that you care about.

12:35.881 --> 12:36.870
I've seen it.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.544
- Finally,
someone who understands.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.754
It all started when I was five.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.382
My unicorn got run over
by a tractor.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.221
- But the people
you sacrifice for...

12:55.525 --> 12:57.026
are they worth it?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.654
Do they really care about you?

12:59.738 --> 13:02.195
Or are they the ones that are
only out for themselves?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.189
- Right.

13:05.744 --> 13:08.702
But you're different
because you get me?

13:08.789 --> 13:12.828
- Maybe I know what it feels
like to sacrifice in vain.

13:12.918 --> 13:17.002
- You know, you are
probably 100 miles away already.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.705
Yet you're still pitching me
swamp land in Florida.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.040
So why the hard sell?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.999
- I'm not selling anything.

13:23.095 --> 13:24.960
Open the door.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.933
- What?
- Open the door, Duke.

13:32.270 --> 13:33.350
Would you step aside?

13:33.438 --> 13:34.598
My popsicles are melting.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.352
(grocery bags rustling)

13:42.531 --> 13:44.442
J‘J‘

13:47.661 --> 13:49.822
(announcements over P.A.)

13:49.913 --> 13:50.902
(knocking)

13:51.915 --> 13:53.200
Audrey: Excuse me, Dr. Cross?

13:56.086 --> 13:57.872
I'm sorry, this is a bad time?

13:57.963 --> 14:00.204
- No, um, of course not.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.341
You just startled me.
Please... come in.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.919
- Hi, I'm Detective
Audrey Parker, Haven PD.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.471
- Detective Parker,
what can I do for you?

14:10.350 --> 14:11.385
- It's the, uh...

14:11.476 --> 14:13.592
(clears throat)
contagion illness.

14:13.687 --> 14:17.305
- Oh, um, Dwight,
he told me it was over.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.811
I haven't seen any patients
express any symptoms

14:19.901 --> 14:22.153
for the past few days now.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.193
- Don't worry.
I know about the Troubles.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.737
I spend my life fighting them.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.315
(coughs)

14:29.161 --> 14:30.196
Sorry.

14:30.287 --> 14:31.527
(clears throat)

14:31.621 --> 14:33.577
- You're sick.

14:33.665 --> 14:36.042
Please... sit.

14:39.504 --> 14:42.371
- I thought it was the contagion
illness, but now In

14:43.550 --> 14:46.758
- You think another
Trouble might be the problem?

14:46.845 --> 14:48.631
- I don't know.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.337
- Let's start with
some blood work.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.136
So, what are your symptoms?

14:56.855 --> 14:58.595
- Uh, the-the dry cough.

14:59.441 --> 15:01.181
Uh... fatigue.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.608
Really, l-l feel
fine most of the time,

15:04.696 --> 15:09.531
but then all the sudden
it just hits like a wave.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.444
- You feel quite cool.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.122
- I am freezing all the time.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.665
- Some of your symptoms
sound like exhaustion.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.088
Maybe you need some time off.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.164
(scoffs)

15:26.259 --> 15:28.636
- I can't.
My work is--

15:28.720 --> 15:30.585
it's very important to me.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.047
- For now,
I'll get you a vitamin B12 shot.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.643
Should help with your energy.

15:35.727 --> 15:38.309
You should get something
for your cough over the counter

15:38.396 --> 15:40.648
until I get the results
of your test back.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.472
- I'm curious, Dr. Cross.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.479
Why haven't you told your people
about Haven?

15:45.570 --> 15:49.609
J‘J‘

15:50.909 --> 15:52.649
- In my line of work,

15:52.744 --> 15:53.904
reputation is everything.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.204
If I don't have proof,

15:58.291 --> 16:01.624
I can't convince my colleagues
to believe in a place like this.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.168
so you're covering your own ass

16:04.256 --> 16:06.417
before you blow us
out of the water?

16:06.508 --> 16:08.749
- Your ass, too.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.300
If I don't have
a complete understanding

16:10.387 --> 16:11.672
of what I've found,

16:11.763 --> 16:16.223
my superiors will come in and
most likely mishandle things.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.722
what happens then?

16:22.941 --> 16:23.930
- I don't know.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.934
But the people of this
town need help.

16:29.281 --> 16:30.896
They've already suffered enough.

16:37.038 --> 16:40.622
- l-l need to get back
to my... case.

16:41.251 --> 16:44.084
- Oh, yeah,
that woman who fell apart.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.380
Dr. Verrano sent a... foot.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.462
But she doesn't have
the same DNA marker

16:51.553 --> 16:54.886
I found in all the patients
I tested so far.

16:55.307 --> 16:56.843
- So her own
trouble didn't kill her.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.639
It had to have been
someone else.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.469
Thank you.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.729
- Glad I could help.

17:10.906 --> 17:11.895
(door closes)

17:16.077 --> 17:17.908
(Audrey coughing)

17:17.996 --> 17:19.577
Audrey: Excuse me.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.656
I have a few more
questions for Grace.

17:22.751 --> 17:25.413
I think she might know more
than she realizes,

17:25.503 --> 17:28.995
and right now
she's our only witness.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.705
- Grace isn't here.
I fired her.

17:33.637 --> 17:34.626
- Why?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.336
- Because I found out
she's one of them.

17:41.603 --> 17:42.592
(clears throat)
- Do you know

17:42.687 --> 17:43.938
where your daughter Samantha is?

17:44.022 --> 17:46.604
I think she may have a better
idea of where Grace may be.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.307
- I sent Samantha home
for her own safety.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.439
But there's a boy named
Terrance that the girls hang out with.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.067
I tried to call his parents
to warn them.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.739
He lives up the road.

17:58.119 --> 17:59.108
(coughing)

18:01.706 --> 18:03.116
- What'd the doctor say?

18:03.208 --> 18:05.494
- We're looking for
a missing teenager, remember?

18:05.585 --> 18:08.167
- I remember you insisted on going
to see Dr. Cross alone.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.745
What did she say?

18:10.382 --> 18:12.464
- She took my blood,
she gave me a shot of vitamins,

18:12.550 --> 18:14.836
and didn't discover
my secret identity.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.045
(siren wailing)

18:21.977 --> 18:22.966
(phone ringing)

18:23.061 --> 18:25.768
You get that.
I'll see what's going on.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.812
- Duke, what the hell?

18:31.903 --> 18:34.315
Where are you?
Do you have Mara?

18:34.406 --> 18:35.942
- One,
I'm doing the right thing.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.021
Two, I'm not telling you that.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.654
And three...
Sort of.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.076
- I don't have time for this.
Is Mara with you or not?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.114
- Yeah.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.494
- Bring her in.
Audrey is sick.

18:47.585 --> 18:48.961
We need to find out
if it has something

18:49.045 --> 18:50.330
to do with the separation.

18:50.422 --> 18:52.458
- What do you mean, Audrey is sick?
Is it serious?

18:52.549 --> 18:53.755
- I don't know.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.298
But if we have Mara,
then we can--

18:55.385 --> 18:56.374
- No.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.919
- What?
- Look, I know what I'm doing.

18:59.014 --> 19:00.675
And for once, Nathan...

19:01.766 --> 19:03.848
I need your help.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.550
I need you to bring me
some of the Aether

19:05.645 --> 19:07.351
so that Mara can fix me.

19:07.439 --> 19:08.428
- What?

19:08.523 --> 19:11.686
- To keep me from kicking out
any more dangerous troubles.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.732
- And you actually believe
that she'll help you?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.902
- Hey, pot, this is the kettle.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.398
- Look, I know
I've done crazy things,

19:19.492 --> 19:21.028
but that was for Audrey.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.154
You can't trust Mara.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.655
She's convinced you
to get her the one thing

19:23.747 --> 19:25.157
she needs to open a thinny.

19:25.248 --> 19:28.911
And if she does that, she will
take out the entire town.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.867
- I am the one
who could take out Haven.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.702
I don't have any more nice
little safe Troubles

19:32.797 --> 19:33.786
to let out.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.543
The next one

19:35.633 --> 19:37.134
is gonna be bad.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.712
Mara can stop it.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.464
- I'm not bringing you
the Aether, Duke.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.716
Everything she's
done has been to get Aether.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.547
Bring her in.

19:44.642 --> 19:45.677
We need her.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.519
- Yeah, you're right.
It doesn't add up.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.394
I can't believe a word
that comes out of her mouth.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.021
- Bring her in, Duke.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.817
We'll find another way
to help you.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.065
- Yeah, I know.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.280
(phone beeps, Duke scoffs)

20:05.372 --> 20:08.205
I actually thought he was gonna
come through for me for once.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.123
- So...

20:14.214 --> 20:15.454
now what?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.539
- Now I go take the Aether.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.500
And then you fix me.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.424
Right?

20:23.515 --> 20:25.255
- Right.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.644
J‘J‘

20:30.730 --> 20:32.686
(chatter)

20:39.948 --> 20:40.937
- What happened?

20:41.116 --> 20:43.152
- Grace's friend Terrance
is a workout fiend.

20:43.243 --> 20:46.110
He got crushed
trying to bench-press 280.

20:46.204 --> 20:48.490
- That kid couldn't lift 280
to drop it on himself.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.117
- Well, he could yesterday.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.244
Look, he's way bigger.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.950
- This can't be the same guy.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.160
- It is.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.288
I think this trouble
changes people physically.

20:59.843 --> 21:02.801
The victim at the bakery, she was
in over her head in debt.

21:02.887 --> 21:04.093
Her life was falling apart.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.091
And then she did, literally.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.764
- So he picked up the weight
and then transformed?

21:08.852 --> 21:10.342
(clears throat, phone ringing)

21:15.191 --> 21:16.692
- Vince, what's going on?

21:16.818 --> 21:20.060
(muffled coughing)

21:22.198 --> 21:23.654
- I'll be there
as soon as I can.

21:25.368 --> 21:26.574
- What's he want?

21:27.120 --> 21:28.906
- He just said
it was important.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.282
- Why don't you go and talk to him?
(siren chirps)

21:30.373 --> 21:32.989
I'm gonna head to the hospital.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.245
I want to be there the minute
Terrance gets out of surgery.

21:35.336 --> 21:36.837
(siren wails)

21:38.256 --> 21:39.496
If Grace was here,

21:39.591 --> 21:41.832
she's affected two people
and counting.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.422
(coughing)

21:56.608 --> 21:59.520
J‘J‘

21:59.611 --> 22:00.726
(chatter)

22:01.905 --> 22:02.894
Grace?

22:05.074 --> 22:06.985
Please, I need to talk to you.

22:11.873 --> 22:12.862
- Sam, don't look at her.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.869
Just go, go, go, go.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.211
- Grace.

22:18.588 --> 22:19.577
- HoW's Terrance?

22:21.716 --> 22:23.581
- Is what happened to him--
is it connected

22:23.676 --> 22:25.667
to what happened at the bakery?

22:25.762 --> 22:26.751
- I'll tell you whatever I know,

22:26.846 --> 22:30.179
but please take me
to the hospital to see Terrance.

22:30.433 --> 22:31.422
- Okay.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.063
Charlotte: You've reached
Dr. Charlotte Cross.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.136
Please leave a message.

22:37.232 --> 22:39.018
Dwight: Charlotte, it's me.

22:39.108 --> 22:42.066
See you in 15 minutes
with the Aether and then dinner.

22:44.364 --> 22:47.151
J‘J‘

22:47.242 --> 22:48.607
Change of plans.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.362
Something just came up.

22:50.453 --> 22:51.659
I'll call you later.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.444
(phone beeps)

22:57.085 --> 22:58.825
(door opens)

22:58.920 --> 22:59.909
(door closes)

23:00.004 --> 23:00.993
(Duke sighs)

23:01.089 --> 23:03.171
(scoffs)
- Where did you get that?

23:03.258 --> 23:04.794
- The store.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.964
I like pretty toes.

23:09.847 --> 23:10.836
No Aether?

23:14.352 --> 23:16.138
- It wasn't in the safe.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.185
- Nathan moved it.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.605
He didn't think
that you would turn me in.

23:20.692 --> 23:24.230
You told him what you needed
and why, and still, he--

23:24.320 --> 23:25.901
(groans)

23:25.989 --> 23:28.105
- You have to release
a Trouble, Duke.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.484
How much time
do you think you have left?

23:32.370 --> 23:33.576
- Not long enough.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.508
I really wish you were
somebody else right now.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.585
- Why?

23:53.057 --> 23:56.766
J‘J‘

23:56.853 --> 23:58.059
Well, I'm not.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.728
But I'm here,

24:01.816 --> 24:05.684
so you're just going
to have to make do.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.612
J‘J‘

24:10.825 --> 24:13.817
Vince: The CDC denies
sending Charlotte to Haven.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.162
- Does Dwight know about this?

24:15.246 --> 24:17.328
- Unfortunately, he's convinced
that Charlotte Cross

24:17.415 --> 24:19.201
will be our savior.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.157
- Vince, this woman is
taking care of Audrey now.

24:21.252 --> 24:22.241
Can you back this up?

24:22.337 --> 24:24.202
- Not enough
for Dwight to listen.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.003
We need real proof that
Charlotte Cross

24:26.090 --> 24:27.705
isn't who she says she is.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.301
- So let's get it.

24:29.427 --> 24:30.416
Now.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.463
(splashing)

24:38.102 --> 24:39.091
(knocking)

24:39.937 --> 24:40.926
Charlotte: Hey.

24:41.898 --> 24:44.560
You here to give me
a tissue sample?

24:44.651 --> 24:46.516
- Sure.
- Excellent.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.819
I'm trying to widen my baseline
for the DNA marker.

24:49.906 --> 24:50.895
Sit.

24:58.748 --> 24:59.908
- Nathan Wuornos.

25:00.792 --> 25:04.250
- Sorry, not trying to be rude,
but just-- Gloves.

25:04.337 --> 25:05.702
- Gloves.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.708
- May I ask you
about your Trouble?

25:07.799 --> 25:09.664
I'm keeping a catalog.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.044
- Sure,

25:11.135 --> 25:13.467
after you tell me what's
going on with Audrey Parker.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.384
I'm her partner.

25:17.475 --> 25:21.309
So... what can you tell me
about her illness?

25:23.147 --> 25:25.399
- Doctor-patient
confidentiality.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.348
- Even if I'm a cop?
- Mm-hmm.

25:27.443 --> 25:28.649
- Even if I'm her boyfriend?

25:28.736 --> 25:30.351
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

25:32.824 --> 25:34.530
(distant announcements)

25:37.286 --> 25:38.275
(phone ringing)

25:40.331 --> 25:42.743
- Fill this out
and talk to Audrey.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.041
And when you do,
get her to call me.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.243
She's been ducking me.
(phone beeps)

25:46.337 --> 25:47.326
Mr. Teagues?

25:48.673 --> 25:50.254
All right, Vince.

25:50.341 --> 25:52.753
Yeah, bleach is an antiseptic,

25:52.844 --> 25:55.005
but your brother
should definitely not use it

25:55.096 --> 25:56.176
to clean his wound.

25:56.264 --> 26:00.758
Yeah, even if that's
what he did when he was a kid.

26:00.852 --> 26:02.808
Let me see what else I have.

26:02.895 --> 26:07.685
J‘J‘

26:28.296 --> 26:31.459
J‘J‘

26:31.549 --> 26:33.210
Nathan: We should keep this quiet.

26:33.301 --> 26:35.792
Who's running the DNA test?

26:35.887 --> 26:37.798
- This will be taken care of
in-house.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.880
There is another who is
sympathetic to our cause.

26:42.393 --> 26:45.305
- Vince.
- Gloria will handle it.

26:45.396 --> 26:47.728
She'll have the results
in 24 hours.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.901
Nathan.

26:53.529 --> 26:54.564
- Listen, I know
you don't trust Charlotte,

26:54.655 --> 26:55.986
but now you've gone too far.

26:57.366 --> 26:58.697
- What are you talking about?

27:00.828 --> 27:02.034
- It's missing?
- Yeah.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.662
- What, you think I took it?

27:05.750 --> 27:07.160
- Your safe, your combination.

27:07.251 --> 27:08.752
- I didn't take the Aether,
Dwight.

27:08.836 --> 27:09.825
- Okay, then who?

27:09.921 --> 27:11.582
Who else knew about it?

27:11.672 --> 27:12.661
- Duke.

27:13.216 --> 27:15.753
(sighs)
I should have known.

27:15.843 --> 27:19.461
Mara convinced him to help her
get the Aether back.

27:19.555 --> 27:20.761
- It was in a safe.

27:20.848 --> 27:22.804
- Which probably took him
two minutes to crack.

27:29.273 --> 27:30.774
(announcements over the P.A.)

27:31.943 --> 27:34.104
- Audrey?

27:34.195 --> 27:35.401
I need to talk to you.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.401
- I'm gonna meet you
inside.

27:41.619 --> 27:43.405
- There's something strange
happening to you.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.491
Your test results seem fine,

27:46.582 --> 27:48.573
liver function,
kidneys, all in range,

27:49.043 --> 27:51.750
but I'm seeing protein markers
that concern me.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.123
- I don't understand.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.876
- It's like on a cellular level
you're going through

27:55.967 --> 27:58.208
rapid waves of deterioration.

27:58.302 --> 28:01.009
Every cell in your body
is degenerating.

28:01.097 --> 28:03.133
I've never seen
anything like it.

28:03.224 --> 28:04.384
- But my cough has stopped,

28:04.475 --> 28:06.466
and I'm actually feeling
much better.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.176
Much, much better.

28:09.272 --> 28:12.935
- The vitamin B12 shot may be
giving you a boost of energy,

28:13.025 --> 28:14.014
but it's temporary.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.436
I'll double-check my
diagnosis, but I know what I saw.

28:21.868 --> 28:22.948
- Terry, please don't be mad.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.571
- I can't look like this again.

28:24.662 --> 28:27.404
This is howl used to look,
and they never stopped.

28:27.498 --> 28:28.829
- You were bullied at school?

28:31.168 --> 28:33.454
- They said I was weak
'cause I am.

28:35.006 --> 28:37.588
But as long
as I didn't look weak...

28:37.675 --> 28:40.462
And now I'm back
where I started.

28:40.553 --> 28:43.260
- Bullies around here
aren't very imaginative.

28:43.347 --> 28:47.135
It's all scrawny guys and
fat girls for them.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.602
They do the usual--

28:48.686 --> 28:50.927
names,
farting noises when I walk.

28:51.022 --> 28:53.638
One time, someone left
a trail of potato chips

28:53.733 --> 28:55.269
from my gym class to my locker.

28:55.359 --> 28:57.350
It was mildly clever.

28:58.446 --> 28:59.936
- So what happened today?

29:02.450 --> 29:03.439
(Terry sighs)

29:03.534 --> 29:05.946
- She told me about this morning
at the bakery.

29:06.037 --> 29:08.779
She said to not look at her.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.784
How am I not
supposed to look at someone?

29:10.875 --> 29:13.207
I tried not to, but her eyes,

29:13.294 --> 29:14.283
they caught me in a trance,

29:14.378 --> 29:17.541
and I felt like she
could see right through me.

29:17.632 --> 29:20.248
- You don't have to be afraid.

29:20.343 --> 29:21.833
We can help you.

29:23.346 --> 29:24.461
- It's not my Trouble.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.680
Yeah, I'm bullied,
but I don't let that bother me.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.304
Teenagers are idiots.

29:30.394 --> 29:31.554
Two more years, I graduate,

29:31.646 --> 29:34.183
and Sam and l are out
of this crazy, backwards town.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.895
- You're covering for Samantha.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.318
She was with you
at Terrance's house.

29:41.405 --> 29:42.906
She found Marcy's body.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.736
Samantha's the one
that's Troubled.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.442
- And if she finds out,
her mom is gonna freak.

29:48.537 --> 29:50.528
- Grace and her kind
are dangerous.

29:50.623 --> 29:52.830
I don't want you around her.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.327
- Nobody gets Troubled
on purpose.

29:54.418 --> 29:55.669
It's just how they are.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.960
- Then why do they lie about it?

29:58.047 --> 29:59.036
Hmm?

30:00.633 --> 30:02.589
They keep it a secret
until it's too late.

30:02.677 --> 30:04.463
Look what happened to Marcy.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.053
Your father knew what he was,

30:08.140 --> 30:11.428
and he took advantage of me
because I was young and scared.

30:11.519 --> 30:12.508
That's what the Troubled do.

30:12.603 --> 30:14.184
They use their powers
to terrorize us.

30:15.773 --> 30:17.559
I'm just glad he's gone.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.139
- Dad's dead...

30:21.195 --> 30:22.480
and you still hate him.

30:23.948 --> 30:26.030
You want me to hate him,
but I'm not like you.

30:26.117 --> 30:27.982
- I'm just thankful
you're not like him.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.192
- You're wrong.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.413
- What did you say?

30:31.497 --> 30:33.783
Samantha, look at me
when I'm talking to you.

30:34.917 --> 30:36.908
- You're wrong.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.540
I am like him.

30:39.630 --> 30:42.167
J‘J‘

30:42.258 --> 30:43.293
(coughs)

30:43.384 --> 30:44.624
(breathing heavily)

30:44.719 --> 30:46.835
I can't hold it back anymore.

30:46.929 --> 30:48.294
I'm not strong enough.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.175
- You need to release a
trouble right away.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.512
- Help me let out
something harmless.

30:54.603 --> 30:55.592
- Okay.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.144
- Something that won't
hurt people.

31:01.444 --> 31:04.732
- Concentrate on
what you really want:

31:04.822 --> 31:06.312
not to hurt anyone.

31:08.492 --> 31:10.323
Then let your blood
hit the floor.

31:12.246 --> 31:17.286
J‘J‘

31:23.883 --> 31:25.919
(rattling)

31:26.010 --> 31:26.999
(whistling)

31:31.307 --> 31:33.548
(hissing)

31:37.146 --> 31:38.932
- This isn't gonna be harmless.

31:44.195 --> 31:46.527
(hissing)

31:50.451 --> 31:51.691
- I read about this
in the journal.

31:53.037 --> 31:54.823
It's the Egan family curse.

31:54.997 --> 31:55.986
(breathing heavily)

31:58.042 --> 31:59.703
This guy...

31:59.794 --> 32:01.785
he got stuck in a house fire
when he was a kid.

32:03.631 --> 32:04.620
Years later...

32:05.549 --> 32:07.050
his Trouble activated and...

32:08.135 --> 32:10.217
turned a diner into an oven.

32:10.304 --> 32:12.590
My grandfather couldn't kill him
in time to save the lunch rush.

32:12.681 --> 32:14.808
- Yeah, I remember,
he was an eight-year-old

32:14.892 --> 32:17.554
trapped in a house--
it was burning down,

32:17.645 --> 32:19.636
afraid that no one was
coming to get him.

32:20.815 --> 32:23.648
- So why did I release
this Trouble?

32:23.734 --> 32:25.565
I wanted it
to be something harmless.

32:25.653 --> 32:26.733
- You're like that boy.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.605
You think you're isolated,

32:30.699 --> 32:32.155
alone,

32:32.243 --> 32:34.484
abandoned,

32:34.578 --> 32:36.443
and you don't want
to let yourself feel it.

32:37.748 --> 32:40.410
(whistling)

32:41.794 --> 32:43.580
(bubbling)

32:44.755 --> 32:45.995
Okay.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.330
Let's...

32:47.424 --> 32:50.131
let's get out of here before
the pipes under this place blow.

32:50.219 --> 32:51.208
- No.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.587
I'm not gonna roast
a bunch of innocent people.

32:54.682 --> 32:55.671
You go.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.633
- No.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.228
You need me.

33:00.312 --> 33:03.600
- You don't have to play
this game anymore, Mara.

33:03.691 --> 33:06.899
You don't have to pretend
like you care.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.066
I'm dead.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.607
So you might
as well save yourself.

33:11.699 --> 33:12.905
- I'm not leaving.

33:15.119 --> 33:16.655
Let's fix this.

33:16.745 --> 33:19.578
J‘J‘

33:23.127 --> 33:24.116
- Audrey?

33:25.754 --> 33:27.540
- Can you wait here
just a sec?

33:27.631 --> 33:28.962
Thank you.

33:31.635 --> 33:34.877
- The degeneration,
it reversed itself.

33:34.972 --> 33:37.054
That's why
you're feeling better.

33:37.141 --> 33:40.554
But I need to know
exactly when it started.

33:40.644 --> 33:43.226
- It was at the house,

33:43.314 --> 33:44.394
on Terrance's lawn,

33:44.481 --> 33:45.857
after Samantha looked at me.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.482
I think her Trouble
transforms people.

33:49.570 --> 33:52.562
- So how people feel
on the inside becomes real?

33:53.657 --> 33:55.773
It sounds like this Trouble
is all about self-esteem.

33:55.868 --> 33:56.857
(phone rings)

33:57.036 --> 33:58.901
I've seen how you work, Audrey.

33:58.996 --> 34:02.488
You think of yourself as
someone who helps people, a healer.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.915
So when you got affected
by this Trouble,

34:05.002 --> 34:06.492
your cells repaired themselves.

34:06.587 --> 34:07.576
- We have to get
to the bakery now.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.707
Samantha needs us.

34:11.842 --> 34:12.831
- Audrey?

34:15.804 --> 34:17.089
What happens when you get there?

34:17.181 --> 34:19.092
- I'm gonna talk her down,

34:19.183 --> 34:20.719
help curb her Trouble,
hopefully keep her

34:20.809 --> 34:21.935
from hurting more people.

34:22.019 --> 34:23.350
- So if you do that,

34:23.437 --> 34:25.428
her Trouble will stop
affecting everyone?

34:25.522 --> 34:27.683
(elevator bell dings)
- That's the idea.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.440
- Won't that mean
you get sick again?

34:30.527 --> 34:32.313
- I do what I need to do.

34:34.782 --> 34:36.397
- I'm coming with you.

34:38.369 --> 34:40.200
You might need your doctor.

34:40.287 --> 34:44.530
J‘J‘

34:45.459 --> 34:46.448
- Sam?

34:48.963 --> 34:50.419
What's wrong?

34:50.506 --> 34:52.292
- You have to help her.

34:55.469 --> 34:56.970
- Is that your sister?

34:57.054 --> 34:58.419
- No.

34:58.514 --> 34:59.720
It's my mother.

35:01.976 --> 35:03.466
I gave her the look.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.393
J‘J‘

35:06.480 --> 35:08.220
- I won't abandon you, Duke.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.476
You say you don't need anyone?

35:10.567 --> 35:13.604
This Trouble is proof
that you're lying.

35:13.696 --> 35:15.812
You want people to think
that you're a selfish bastard

35:15.906 --> 35:17.817
so that when they walk away,

35:17.908 --> 35:20.240
they won't know
how badly they've hurt you.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.576
But I know it hurts, Duke.

35:24.957 --> 35:27.824
No matter how much armor
you put on,

35:27.918 --> 35:32.082
it still hurts.

35:32.172 --> 35:33.457
- You wouldn't be
saying all this

35:33.549 --> 35:36.211
if you didn't have
some kind of angle.

35:36.427 --> 35:37.416
-ldo.

35:40.097 --> 35:41.837
To save you.

35:43.934 --> 35:48.348
J‘J‘

36:03.203 --> 36:04.192
It's over.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.320
- Yeah.

36:07.958 --> 36:08.947
Why?

36:09.043 --> 36:11.705
- Because you finally believe
I care about you.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.328
That's why.

36:18.385 --> 36:22.549
J‘J‘

36:26.560 --> 36:31.054
J‘J‘

36:31.148 --> 36:32.308
- I did it on purpose.

36:34.234 --> 36:36.316
I looked right at her.

36:36.403 --> 36:39.395
- Samantha, it's not your fault.

36:40.282 --> 36:41.271
(coughs)

36:42.326 --> 36:43.315
- Audrey...

36:45.162 --> 36:48.154
Let me take Samantha and Janet
back to my lab.

36:48.248 --> 36:49.579
Maybe there's a
way to keep Samantha

36:49.666 --> 36:52.578
from affecting anyone while
still keeping you healthy.

36:52.669 --> 36:54.079
- Please, don't.

36:54.171 --> 36:55.331
You're helping her.

36:57.216 --> 36:59.172
- Samantha,
this could end with you.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.424
You're not evil just because
you're Troubled.

37:04.515 --> 37:05.755
- Shut up!

37:05.849 --> 37:08.181
You don't know
what you're talking about.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.514
- You don't have to be
so angry.

37:11.605 --> 37:13.516
No one is trying to hurt you.

37:13.607 --> 37:15.848
Troubled people
aren't monsters.

37:17.861 --> 37:20.193
They're just
as scared as you are.

37:26.120 --> 37:27.951
J‘J‘

37:28.038 --> 37:29.027
(chuckles)

37:32.126 --> 37:33.115
- Mom?

37:34.878 --> 37:36.084
- I'm all right.

37:37.381 --> 37:38.370
- I'm sorry.

37:44.221 --> 37:47.008
- Now get out of my store.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.509
I'm gonna save my child.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.057
She's being punished because she
doesn't know right from wrong.

37:51.145 --> 37:52.635
I'm gonna fix that.

37:52.729 --> 37:55.015
- The Troubles are not
a punishment.

37:55.107 --> 37:56.096
They're genetic.

37:57.109 --> 38:00.226
- Audrey's right.
We have scientific proof.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.821
- Aren't you listening, Mom?

38:01.905 --> 38:02.940
Maybe if you weren't
the way you are,

38:03.031 --> 38:05.693
this would have never
have happened to me.

38:05.868 --> 38:06.983
- No, Sam.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.157
- It's okay, Sam.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.234
- I didn't...

38:13.750 --> 38:14.956
You're my daughter.

38:20.591 --> 38:22.502
(Audrey coughs)

38:27.097 --> 38:28.507
woman: Haven PD, can I help you?

38:28.599 --> 38:30.965
- Surveillance footage
is still downloading.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.550
- Audrey went
to see Dr. Cross today

38:33.645 --> 38:35.181
as a patient.

38:35.272 --> 38:36.933
Something's been up with her
since the contagion.

38:37.858 --> 38:39.064
- I didn't know.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.854
This mean you've decided
to trust Charlotte?

38:41.945 --> 38:43.606
- I'd like to trust her, Dwight,

38:43.697 --> 38:46.234
but it's kind of hard
when Audrey's involved.

38:47.326 --> 38:48.315
- It's up.

38:50.746 --> 38:54.034
J‘J‘

38:55.626 --> 38:57.366
Crocker.

38:58.629 --> 38:59.618
- No, wait.

39:00.339 --> 39:02.625
That look on his face,
I've seen it a lot.

39:02.716 --> 39:05.173
He's furious.

39:05.260 --> 39:06.875
I don't think he has the Aether.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.506
Can you back it up?

39:12.351 --> 39:14.842
There, that's the vial of
Aether in his hand.

39:14.937 --> 39:16.393
Can you tell who it is?

39:16.480 --> 39:18.812
- Nope,
but I can see the tattoo.

39:18.899 --> 39:20.560
Definitely in the Guard.

39:20.651 --> 39:21.731
I'll get a name.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.103
(crickets chirping)

39:31.662 --> 39:36.201
J‘J‘

39:56.937 --> 39:59.019
(panting)

40:14.246 --> 40:15.452
- It's okay, Duke.

40:20.043 --> 40:22.034
J‘J‘

40:23.880 --> 40:26.292
- You'll be the first to know
when I get the Aether back.

40:26.383 --> 40:28.123
- I'm sorry we had
to cancel dinner.

40:28.218 --> 40:29.719
- Ah, maybe
it's for the best.

40:29.803 --> 40:31.464
I mean, we have a lot
of important things to do,

40:31.555 --> 40:33.386
and work can get complicated
enough without...

40:34.850 --> 40:36.181
distractions.

40:36.268 --> 40:37.474
- I completely agree.

40:41.398 --> 40:42.387
- Hey.

40:42.983 --> 40:44.189
What is it?

40:44.860 --> 40:46.976
- It's what I saw today.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.480
A woman who fell apart,

40:48.572 --> 40:51.314
a mother whose tortured
daughter transformed her

40:51.408 --> 40:53.899
based on her own ignorance
and cruelty.

40:53.994 --> 40:56.701
ljust wish I could do more.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.744
- Hey.

40:58.832 --> 41:00.117
Troubles are tough.

41:00.208 --> 41:02.540
You just have to take it
one day at a time.

41:02.628 --> 41:05.495
If you're here long
enough, it gets a little easier.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.206
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:13.096 --> 41:16.680
You should lock this
if you're gonna work this late.

41:16.767 --> 41:18.052
- Will do.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.132
Night, Dwight.

41:19.895 --> 41:22.602
- Night.

41:26.318 --> 41:28.900
J‘J‘

41:28.987 --> 41:29.976
(lock clicks)

41:44.670 --> 41:50.085
J‘J‘

41:56.640 --> 41:59.302
J‘J‘
