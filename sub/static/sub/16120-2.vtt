( music playing )

00:08.840 --> 00:13.277
* You spend
your days... *

00:15.080 --> 00:17.674
- ( sniffling )
- * Watching the door

00:24.490 --> 00:29.826
* Yeah, you spend
your whole life waiting... *

00:29.860 --> 00:31.589
- Morning.
- You're up early.

00:31.630 --> 00:34.656
* But you don't know
what for... *

00:36.470 --> 00:39.530
Thought we'd
go get breakfast
before you left town.

00:39.570 --> 00:42.300
George wanted me
to stop by the paper
before I leave.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.308
Thanks.

00:46.540 --> 00:49.179
Just let me know when
your daddy's serwce IS.

00:49.210 --> 00:51.303
I'll take the day off.

00:51.350 --> 00:53.477
It's just gonna be
a whole lot of people
who you don't know

00:53.520 --> 00:55.340
_ who I can't
Introduce you to.

00:58.120 --> 01:02.420
- Nova...
- ( train horn blaring )

01:02.460 --> 01:04.553
You don't even have
to gIve me the time of day.

01:04.590 --> 01:06.057
Not even a look.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.165
Come on, you were
at my daddy's service.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.566
So was the entire
police force and
half of New Orleans.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.534
It was easier for me
to blend in.

01:15.570 --> 01:18.562
What are you
trying to say?

01:18.610 --> 01:21.329
That I can't come
or you Just don't
want me to?

01:24.880 --> 01:26.768
( sighs )

01:30.250 --> 01:32.150
Saturday.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.822
Nova...

01:40.330 --> 01:42.867
I wanna make sure
you're okay.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.664
So please pick up
when I call you, okay?

01:51.640 --> 01:56.805
* Oh, this is
how we are fading *

01:56.850 --> 01:59.819
* This is how
we are fading... *

03:20.000 --> 03:25.563
* How can I say this
without breaking? *

03:25.600 --> 03:31.232
* How can I say this
without taking over?

03:31.270 --> 03:35.707
* How can I put it down
into words *

03:35.740 --> 03:41.315
* When it's almost too much
for my soul alone? *

03:44.550 --> 03:49.886
* I loved and I loved
and I lost you *

03:49.930 --> 03:55.755
* I loved and I loved and
I lost you *

03:55.800 --> 04:00.999
* I loved and I loved
and I lost you *

04:01.040 --> 04:04.362
* And it hurts
like hell *

04:06.780 --> 04:12.047
* Yeah,
it hurts like hell... *

to know the secrets *

04:29.400 --> 04:34.793
* I don't want them to know
the way I loved you *

04:34.840 --> 04:40.403
* I don't think
they'd understand it, no *

04:40.440 --> 04:45.275
* I don't think they would
accept me, no *

04:48.550 --> 04:53.817
* I loved and I loved
and I lost you *

( train horn blaring )

05:24.120 --> 05:27.089
( chattering continues )

05:31.130 --> 05:32.449
Can I help you?

05:34.560 --> 05:39.122
( train horn blaring )

05:39.170 --> 05:43.937
I'm Samuel Landry,
bu_t folks around here
Just call me Sam.

05:43.970 --> 05:46.063
You must be Ernest's
California girl.

05:46.110 --> 05:48.738
Charlotte, right?

05:48.780 --> 05:50.577
Charley.

05:50.610 --> 05:53.613
You have my deepest
sympathies.

05:53.650 --> 05:55.447
Your father
was a good man.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.981
A damn good man.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.659
Man:
Little man, come here.
What do you think?

06:01.890 --> 06:05.929
Is there something
that I can do for you,
Mr. Landry?

06:05.960 --> 06:08.497
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
( whistles )

06:11.630 --> 06:13.894
I thought it best
to make you an offer
in person.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.105
Thought you didn't think
anyone was home.

06:32.790 --> 06:35.850
Just give me a call
when y'all ready to talk.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.508
* Tongues on fire

06:49.540 --> 06:53.032
* Speak up
'cause the prophets seem
to have gone to sleep *

06:53.080 --> 06:56.129
* Make a war on terror?

06:56.180 --> 06:59.638
* Terror is taking
its war out on me *

06:59.680 --> 07:02.046
* Oh, why you gonna go
and put the fuel *

07:02.080 --> 07:06.187
* Into the middle
of the fire? *

07:06.220 --> 07:08.108
- * It's ablaze
- * It's ablaze

07:08.160 --> 07:13.029
* And the temperature
is slowly getting higher... *

07:13.060 --> 07:15.790
Sorry to hear
about your daddy,
Nova.

07:15.830 --> 07:17.889
Thank you, George.

07:17.930 --> 07:20.467
But you didn't
bring me all the way in
for condolences.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.866
Truth be told,
I thought we should
discuss your next story.

07:25.910 --> 07:28.674
Something that would be
front page worthy.

07:28.710 --> 07:30.200
What?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.639
You didn't like
my last three pitches?

07:32.680 --> 07:33.942
About the lead in the water?

07:33.980 --> 07:35.948
The kidney problems?
The nervous system damage?

07:35.980 --> 07:38.141
Look, your sister
and Davis West are coming
out for the service, right?

07:40.260 --> 07:42.854
I was hoping that's what
you'd be working on.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.559
Since when
are you chasmg
the gossip pages?

07:47.600 --> 07:49.568
Since they started
making more than us.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.228
Look, Davis West's face
is what people want to see.

07:52.270 --> 07:54.135
It's what they want
to read about.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.578
So you thought
I'd just roll up in here,

07:59.610 --> 08:02.977
happy to tell
all my family business?

08:03.010 --> 08:05.069
I thought you'd like to set
the record straight.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.613
No, I have
to bury my father.

08:09.250 --> 08:12.014
I'm not a source.

08:12.050 --> 08:16.726
Dig like everybody else
getting their stories
on Davis.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.250
Look, at least give me
the accuser's name.

08:19.930 --> 08:22.296
If you want to talk
about my story,

08:22.330 --> 08:24.025
we're good.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.890
Otherwise,

08:25.930 --> 08:28.296
stop wasting
my gas money.

08:32.170 --> 08:33.831
( sighs )

08:33.880 --> 08:35.632
( scoffs )

08:38.950 --> 08:41.646
( basketball game
playing over earbuds )

08:41.680 --> 08:45.047
( phone buzzing )

08:55.860 --> 08:57.896
Sit on down.
Let me do the stirrin'.

08:57.930 --> 09:00.694
No, I got it, baby.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.731
I heard you up all night
walking around.

09:02.770 --> 09:04.829
It's the least I can do.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.815
( phone buzzing )

09:17.950 --> 09:20.748
We gotta go get
some loafers for Blue.

09:20.790 --> 09:23.987
He done long outgrowed
the other ones.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.851
What he gotta get
dressed up for?

09:26.900 --> 09:30.063
What he gotta
get dressed up for?

09:30.100 --> 09:32.898
To say goodbye to his papa
for the last time.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.000
( clears throat )

09:37.040 --> 09:39.201
A funeral ain't
no place for kids.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.071
What?

09:41.110 --> 09:44.079
Why are we rushing something
he got to deal with
later on, anyhow?

09:44.110 --> 09:47.819
So, Blue don't
get no closure like
the rest of us gonna get?

09:47.850 --> 09:50.216
He don't need closure.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.889
He need to be a kid.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.788
You-- you ain't no more
than a kid yourself, baby,
so how you know?

10:05.130 --> 10:06.939
( chattering )

10:10.210 --> 10:12.974
Man:
...and his spank God!

10:13.010 --> 10:14.705
Davis West has decided

10:14.740 --> 10:16.230
that when he hits
a buzzer beater--

10:16.280 --> 10:17.702
- ( buzzer buzzes )
- ...he's gonna go hit

10:17.750 --> 10:18.899
some booty.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.214
What you looking at, man?

10:21.250 --> 10:23.787
Open palm,
double pat,
and across both cheeks.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.981
Only problem is,
that ain't his wife!

10:26.020 --> 10:28.250
( overlapping clamoring )

10:28.290 --> 10:30.383
Woman: Davis, do you have
a statement about
the rape allegations?

10:30.430 --> 10:32.990
- ( lights clicking )
- Davis: I'm innocent.

10:33.030 --> 10:35.396
- ( clamoring continues )
- Man: Bro!

10:35.430 --> 10:37.660
What are you doing?

10:37.700 --> 10:39.122
- You got caught
smacking some--
- ( door opens )

10:39.170 --> 10:41.388
...random girl's butt
in a hotel room

10:41.440 --> 10:42.930
by a video camera?

10:42.970 --> 10:44.699
You're the gentle--

10:44.740 --> 10:47.675
- Where you been?
- I went for a run.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.700
Out to Dad's.

10:54.250 --> 10:57.242
You know, it wouldn't hurt
if you got out, too.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.144
Get some fresh air.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.782
Okay.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.458
There are a lot of notes
at the house

11:08.500 --> 11:11.219
from this Remy Newell?

11:11.270 --> 11:13.238
- Y'all know him?
- Mm-hmm.

11:13.270 --> 11:16.467
Good friend
of your daddy's.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.231
I guess he's got
some tractor part for Dad.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.077
He knows--

11:22.110 --> 11:24.044
He knows he's passed,
right?

11:25.480 --> 11:27.869
Everybody knows.

11:31.220 --> 11:33.450
He got Pop's clutch kit.

11:35.890 --> 11:38.484
I got some things
lined up this week.

11:38.530 --> 11:42.057
I could do it,
if you want.

11:42.100 --> 11:45.991
All right.
Appreciate it.

11:46.030 --> 11:50.308
Remy be up
at B & C Seafood
for lunch every Wednesday.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.831
( phone vibrates )

12:11.330 --> 12:12.922
Which one are you
looking for?

12:12.960 --> 12:15.258
The one from the parish fair
a few years back.

12:15.300 --> 12:18.326
- I thought it was here.
- Just use the one of Daddy
on his boat.

12:18.370 --> 12:21.396
Lord knows, your daddy loved
that boat about as much
as he loved y'all's mama,

12:21.440 --> 12:24.967
but that picture ain't right
for no funeral program.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.978
Hey,

12:27.010 --> 12:29.205
you gonna go wake Blue up
before y'all late again?

12:29.240 --> 12:30.502
They had
the faculty conference

12:30.550 --> 12:32.040
this morning.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.139
He was tossing
and turning all night.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.341
I'm gonna let him sleep.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.213
Hey.
When did you get here?

12:39.250 --> 12:41.411
Just got here.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.926
Whoa.
Those are beautiful.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.964
- Your mama sent it.
- That was sweet of her.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.889
She sends
her deepest condolences.

12:57.970 --> 13:01.508
So, what's there to do
for Daddy's funeral?
Are we printing programs?

13:01.540 --> 13:04.577
I wrote it up
and put the order in with
the printer's an hour ago.

13:04.610 --> 13:06.498
What about the menu
for the repast?

13:06.550 --> 13:09.314
Aunt Vi and I
went through it
last night.

13:09.350 --> 13:11.181
And his suit?

13:11.220 --> 13:13.017
I'm gonna go by the house
and grab a couple of 'em.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.516
What up, Wood?

13:18.330 --> 13:20.548
Well, there must be
something I can do.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.192
You got enough
on your plate,

13:22.230 --> 13:24.562
with everything
that's going on back home.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.591
I'm here.

13:26.630 --> 13:29.064
I can help.
Just give me
whatever's left.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.568
We're good.

13:31.610 --> 13:34.078
Okay, what about
the tables, chairs,
Hnens?

13:34.110 --> 13:36.078
We got extra tables
and chairs out there
in the shade,

13:36.110 --> 13:38.999
just need wiping down,
is all.

13:39.050 --> 13:41.610
What about the casket?

13:41.650 --> 13:44.483
We're meeting at Price's
at 3:00 to pick one out.

13:46.220 --> 13:47.448
And you were just
gonna do that

13:47.490 --> 13:49.185
- without me?
- No.

13:49.220 --> 13:51.552
We're doing this
together, okay?

13:51.590 --> 13:53.524
No big deal.

14:02.670 --> 14:04.535
Oh, God, Blue.

14:04.570 --> 14:07.903
( whispering )
Blue, Blue, Blue!
Hey, come here, buddy.

14:07.940 --> 14:10.306
Thought we said Kenya
was gonna stay home
with me?

14:10.350 --> 14:14.047
- But, Papa, I want--
- Oh?

14:14.080 --> 14:16.981
Oh, what's that,
Kenya?

14:17.020 --> 14:18.009
Okay.

14:18.050 --> 14:19.381
She said she wanna stay home,

14:19.420 --> 14:22.287
watch some T.V.,
keep Pop a little company.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.255
Think Kenya can stay home
with me today?

14:25.290 --> 14:26.484
Yeah?

14:28.160 --> 14:30.628
- Miss Velez!
- Hello, Mr. Bordelon.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.389
- How are you doing today?
- Good!

14:33.440 --> 14:35.567
Oh!
( laughing )

14:35.600 --> 14:39.104
Don't let Kenya watch
too much T.V., Pop.

14:39.140 --> 14:41.574
She's scared
of big boy movies.

14:41.610 --> 14:44.078
Don't worry, buddy,
she gonna be with me
the whole time.

14:44.110 --> 14:46.305
- But she--
- Hey, how about
you tell me

14:46.350 --> 14:49.274
who the first
Latino astronaut is?

14:49.320 --> 14:52.915
Uh, Franklin Chang-Daz.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.951
And then the first
Latina astronaut?

14:54.990 --> 14:56.651
Ellen Ochoa!

14:56.690 --> 15:00.956
That's right!
All right, go on inside.
Get in there.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.161
Oh, these kids.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.090
So, how you been?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.267
Uh...

15:09.300 --> 15:12.133
as well as expected,
I guess.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.536
- You're great with him.
- He's a special kid.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.536
Yeah, he is.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.400
Good genes.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.940
( chuckles )

15:21.980 --> 15:25.609
( laughing )

15:25.650 --> 15:28.619
Look, I-- I wouldn't ask
if I didn't have to

15:28.660 --> 15:32.687
but... think you might be able
to watch Blue again?

15:32.730 --> 15:35.699
During the service
on Saturday, you know,
the funeral.

15:35.730 --> 15:38.528
I'm sorry.

15:38.570 --> 15:44.031
I, uh, I teach ESL classes
on the weekends to make
extra cash.

15:44.070 --> 15:46.265
But I would if I could.

15:46.310 --> 15:49.507
- You know that, right?
- Yeah, ain't no problem.

15:49.540 --> 15:53.977
You probably need
to get back in there.
I gotta get goin'.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.545
I'll see you later.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.048
T.V. day with Kenya?

15:59.090 --> 16:02.116
( chuckles )
Something like that.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.355
Only cartoons,
Ralph Angel.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.729
( chuckling continues )
All right, I promise.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.296
( music playing )

16:14.370 --> 16:15.394
How y'all doing
over here?

16:15.440 --> 16:16.737
- Just checking.
- I'm good.

16:16.770 --> 16:18.067
You like that meatloaf,
don't you?

16:18.110 --> 16:19.338
* After you want me...

16:19.370 --> 16:22.203
Special recipe we have here
at the diner.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.208
- Anything else I can get you?
- Excuse me, hi.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.740
Is there
a Remy Newell here?

16:25.780 --> 16:29.341
Over there.

16:29.380 --> 16:30.745
I know y'all want
some dessert.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.542
- Yeah, something sweet
as you.
- Uh-huh.

16:32.590 --> 16:34.478
Y'all want to buy
some pecan pie?

16:37.260 --> 16:40.229
Excuse me?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.750
Are you Remy Newell?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.768
Yes, ma'am.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.236
I thought you'd be old.

16:49.270 --> 16:51.238
( laughs )

16:51.270 --> 16:54.103
But still good looking,
right?

16:54.140 --> 16:56.370
( laughs )
Sorry.

16:56.410 --> 16:59.140
That's okay.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.579
I'm Ernest Bordelon's
daughter.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.679
I found your notes
at his place.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.814
I thought you'd be
more of a peer.

17:05.850 --> 17:10.458
Well, please,
sit on down.

17:10.490 --> 17:12.424
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.549
Um...

17:19.100 --> 17:20.465
Waitress:
A cup of coffee for you.

17:27.610 --> 17:29.669
- Mm. That's horrible.
- Terrible, right?

17:29.710 --> 17:32.702
- Mm-hmm.
- Maybe the worst
I've ever had.

17:32.750 --> 17:36.572
Well, it ain't no Starbucks
around here but the flapjacks
are worth coming back for.

17:36.620 --> 17:40.454
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Mm.

17:40.490 --> 17:44.256
Hey, just let me know
when you'd like me to bring
that clutch kit over.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.588
I didn't really
come here for that.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.294
When I read all those notes
you left...

17:52.330 --> 17:55.868
it seems like you and my dad
were pretty close?

17:55.900 --> 17:58.539
I'm really gonna miss
your dad.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.428
Yeah, Mr. Ernest
kept me out of a lot of

18:02.480 --> 18:06.849
what would have been
knock down, drag out fights
back in the day.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.145
Yeah, he was a good man.
But you know your daddy.

18:12.250 --> 18:15.310
I didn't know everything.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.624
It looks like my dad
was in a lot of debt,

18:17.660 --> 18:21.448
but I really
had no idea how much.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.594
What was going on
with him?

18:24.630 --> 18:26.598
I-- I don't know.

18:26.630 --> 18:30.600
I know he hadn't
farmed nothing
in the last two years.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.872
You know, Mr. Ernest
really was proud of you.

18:36.910 --> 18:38.207
I mean,
couldn't keep your name

18:38.250 --> 18:39.603
out of his mouth.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.413
( chuckles )

18:42.880 --> 18:46.213
A Samuel Landry came by
to make an offer--

18:46.250 --> 18:49.788
No, no.
Not here.

18:49.820 --> 18:53.495
Look here.

18:53.530 --> 18:56.658
When y'all get
everything squared away
with Mr. Ernest...

18:58.430 --> 19:00.489
I want you to call me, okay,

19:00.540 --> 19:02.496
and we'll talk it out.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.861
In the meantime,
I gotta get back to work.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.208
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. West.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.834
If you and your family
need anything,

19:09.880 --> 19:12.542
y'all just holler,
you hear?

19:21.260 --> 19:23.922
Miss Nova, I already
come down $1,000.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.679
- I'm still running
a business.
- No, we can pay the--

19:26.730 --> 19:29.324
And how much of that business
have I sent your way?

19:29.360 --> 19:31.897
That my daddy referred
your way?

19:31.930 --> 19:34.569
( sighs )

19:34.600 --> 19:36.932
I can do another $500,
but no better.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.205
- Then nine it is.
- Nine It IS.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.343
I'm not gonna forget this.

19:45.380 --> 19:47.769
You're a good man,
Mr. Price.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.380
Nothing like
Brother Ernest,
but I do my best.

19:50.420 --> 19:54.959
You can put it all on this,
Mr. Price.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.981
We'll handle
the arrangements.

19:57.020 --> 19:58.749
We're gonna give
Brother Ernest

19:58.790 --> 20:00.758
the homegoing he deserves.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.722
You have my word.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.297
Ed, put a third
on her card.

20:05.330 --> 20:08.390
Spread out
the remainder on these.
Put $300 on each.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.668
I'll pay
Ralph Angel's part.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.258
What? You ain't
gotta do that.

20:11.310 --> 20:13.369
Just let me cover
Ralph Angel's portion.

20:13.410 --> 20:14.502
Ralph Angel can't pay
you back.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.007
You don't even know
what I got.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.701
That's what I'm saying,
he doesn't have to.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.843
So, y'all gonna act like
I ain't even sitting here?

20:21.380 --> 20:24.019
I'mma pay my part.

20:24.050 --> 20:25.381
I just need a loan
till Friday,

20:25.420 --> 20:26.682
when I got
my money coming in.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.450
- Ralph--
- I got it.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.458
I just need a few days.

20:38.330 --> 20:40.366
Split the cost in half,
Mr. Price.

20:40.400 --> 20:45.360
Put half on mine
and the other half
across Nova's cards.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.303
( clears throat )

20:51.350 --> 20:53.511
Shall we pick out
a casket?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.541
( sighs )

20:59.920 --> 21:01.888
He liked Oak,
didn't he?

21:01.920 --> 21:03.683
He didn't fuss
with colors.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.619
Burgundy is nice,
maybe.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.548
Could I suggest
the purple?

21:08.600 --> 21:11.694
It gives a royal feeling,
and he was a king.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.528
Even got
velvet lining.

21:18.870 --> 21:22.328
I prefer white.

21:22.380 --> 21:25.440
He was our black stone,

21:25.480 --> 21:28.643
our protection.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.272
It should be white.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.627
Let light send him back
to the light.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.548
You know?

21:41.430 --> 21:44.661
A white casket.

21:44.700 --> 21:45.689
Will that work
for y'all?

21:50.710 --> 21:52.666
We'll take
this white casket.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.632
Okay, we can do that.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.409
Good.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.500
And I would like to sew this
into the satin?

22:02.450 --> 22:04.941
We don't allow
that kind of thing, Miss Nova.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.857
We run a straight
Christian business here.

22:09.990 --> 22:13.426
If she wants the pouch
in the casket,

22:13.460 --> 22:16.691
the pouch is going
in the casket.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.823
Okay.
I meant no harm.

22:22.470 --> 22:24.563
( purse unzips )

22:24.610 --> 22:26.566
Wait, y'all, these are
the show caskets.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.999
Y'all can't be
messing with them
like that.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.970
But you know what,
y'all are like family.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.840
Go on and I'll make sure

22:35.880 --> 22:37.939
this one belongs
to Brother Ernest.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.744
- King you.
- King me, dude!

23:10.790 --> 23:12.542
( laughs )

23:13.860 --> 23:16.010
- You win.
- I Win?

23:16.060 --> 23:18.449
Yeah.
( laughs )

23:18.490 --> 23:20.048
( phone vibrates )

23:20.090 --> 23:22.752
Your dad.
You better answer it.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.159
( beeps )

23:32.210 --> 23:34.178
Davis:
Micah, you there?

23:34.210 --> 23:36.132
I called the Aspen house,
Newport Beach--

23:36.180 --> 23:39.570
Where are you guys, man?

23:40.680 --> 23:43.547
Grandpa died.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.639
( sighs )
You're in St. Josephine's?

23:47.720 --> 23:48.948
( beeping continues )

23:52.960 --> 23:54.621
( music playing )

23:54.660 --> 23:59.529
* Need to search myself
to go back *

23:59.570 --> 24:01.993
* And those signs
of our performance... *

24:02.040 --> 24:04.201
How you holding up?

24:04.240 --> 24:08.939
About as well as you,
I assume.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.948
Not Daddy...

24:10.980 --> 24:12.049
Davis.

24:16.080 --> 24:20.141
Let's just say,
with everything
that's happened,

24:20.190 --> 24:23.159
you can dig a hole
right next to Daddy
and leave me there.

24:23.190 --> 24:24.680
Don't conjure that up.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.948
* Why we're meant

24:26.990 --> 24:29.527
* And understand something,
baby *

24:29.560 --> 24:32.563
* Now, I know God
has brought me here *

24:32.600 --> 24:34.966
* For something

24:35.000 --> 24:36.695
* Hey

24:36.740 --> 24:40.107
"f What is the Bible
Without the heart... *

24:40.140 --> 24:41.732
( chattering )

24:44.080 --> 24:46.105
What else are
you thinking about
for the repast?

24:46.150 --> 24:47.572
- Some crabs?
- Yeah, get some crabs.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.973
Hey, Mrs. Nguyen,
how's it going?

24:49.020 --> 24:52.046
Yeah, let me look
at some of the crab here.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.615
- Charley: You want
the crawfish, too?
- Yeah!

24:54.660 --> 24:57.527
No, I don't think we gonna do
crawfish today, I think
we gonna do this crab.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.723
- Yeah, here we go.
- Let's see what
you got there.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.027
- Mm-hmm.
- It's so beautiful.

25:03.060 --> 25:04.721
Looks like joy.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.522
Just give it all to me.
Yeah, I need all of that.

25:06.570 --> 25:09.038
- Let's see--
- Hey, what's in there?

25:09.070 --> 25:11.300
This is the snapper here--
no, I'll take this big one
right here.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.672
This one?

25:13.710 --> 25:15.268
- Yeah, that's perfect.
Thank you so much.
- Okay.

25:15.310 --> 25:18.279
What do we got in here?

25:18.310 --> 25:20.005
So, this is--
this is redfish
right here?

25:20.050 --> 25:21.677
- Yes.
- Yeah, that looks
really good.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.210
Let me see, you got--

25:23.250 --> 25:24.786
- Yeah, give me all of that.
- ( loud thumping )

25:24.820 --> 25:25.787
- What was that?
- Okay.

25:25.820 --> 25:27.139
Are they moving?

25:27.190 --> 25:28.612
Yeah, they moving,
they're alive.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.013
I mean, you got
to get 'em fresh.

25:30.060 --> 25:31.550
I thought maybe
they were just soakin'

25:31.590 --> 25:33.922
- in there or something.
- You don't remember?

25:33.960 --> 25:36.758
- Charley, really? Really?
- What?

25:38.070 --> 25:39.822
( sighs )

25:39.870 --> 25:43.067
I need you to wrap--
wrap the head up.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.660
Thank you.

25:45.710 --> 25:49.999
_ * What am I
Without my shadow? *

25:53.850 --> 25:55.909
( phone vibrating )

25:55.950 --> 25:57.679
Twenty.
Have a really good day.

25:57.720 --> 26:01.588
- All right, thank you.
- (vibrating continues )

26:01.620 --> 26:05.886
- Hello?
- Ralph Angel: What you doing
this weekend?

26:05.930 --> 26:06.828
Ralph Angel.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.824
Yeah, what you
doin' Saturday?

26:11.070 --> 26:11.968
Working.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.662
Look, I got Pop's funeral
and I can't take Blue with me.

26:18.740 --> 26:22.733
It's an early shift,
so I can be out way before
the service starts,

26:22.780 --> 26:24.941
or get somebody
to cover for me.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.902
All right,
11: 00 and no later.

26:26.950 --> 26:29.942
- All right.
- Now, I'm for real.

26:29.980 --> 26:32.881
Violet's house, 11:00,
and no later than that.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.751
I promise you, I--

26:34.790 --> 26:37.350
I'm not gonna let you down.
Thank you so much.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.793
( laughs )
Sorry. Thank you.

26:49.840 --> 26:52.138
There you go.

26:57.980 --> 27:01.108
How's Aunt Vi
holding up?

27:01.150 --> 27:04.119
She gonna be all right.

27:04.150 --> 27:07.711
Been through worse
and came out
on the other side.

27:07.760 --> 27:11.127
I ain't seen her
like this since
Ralph Angel's trial.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.129
That woman loves hard.

27:14.160 --> 27:18.699
- Hard for her
to let things go.
- ( truck beeping )

27:18.730 --> 27:20.391
Who is that?

27:20.430 --> 27:22.398
Whole bunch of peckerwoods.

27:26.310 --> 27:28.278
What the hell y'all think
y'all doin'?

27:28.310 --> 27:30.744
We're your servers.
We're here to set up
for tomorrow.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.407
Ain't nobody call
for no servers.

27:32.450 --> 27:34.873
You need to pack that bitch up
and go on back to New Orleans.

27:34.920 --> 27:38.344
But the order came from
Charley Bordelon-West.

27:47.030 --> 27:49.897
What the hell
is that out there?

27:49.930 --> 27:51.864
It's for the repast.

27:51.900 --> 27:55.290
You something else, Charley,
you know that?

27:55.340 --> 27:59.265
Whoa, whoa.
It is just some drinks,
tables, and linens.

27:59.310 --> 28:02.234
- I thought it would help.
- Don't nobody need
no fancy ass linen.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.475
Okay, look.
I'm paying for it.

28:04.510 --> 28:06.978
So, what's it matter?
Just let the servers
handle it.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.216
They know
what they're doing.

28:08.250 --> 28:09.410
And you don't know
a damn thing

28:09.450 --> 28:12.419
about n_othin'
except wasting money.

28:12.450 --> 28:15.055
How long have you
been gone, huh?

28:15.090 --> 28:16.489
You ain't been gone
that long.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.987
How come you don't remember
how it's done?

28:18.030 --> 28:20.328
Oh, and how it's done
has to be your way?

28:20.360 --> 28:21.327
Ain't that right?

28:21.360 --> 28:23.726
I've been trying to help

28:23.770 --> 28:26.466
but for some reason
you've been blocking me
at every turn.

28:26.500 --> 28:31.403
We don't honor our father
by sitting friends and family
outside at fancy tables.

28:31.440 --> 28:36.503
We don't honor our father
by haVIng strangers serve
those grieving.

28:36.540 --> 28:39.907
We serve comfort food
to those who need comfort

28:39.950 --> 28:42.248
and we do it
with our own hands!

28:42.280 --> 28:45.113
That's how a family
does a repast.

28:49.060 --> 28:53.121
And we certainly
don't pay our respects
with American Express.

28:56.130 --> 28:59.429
Now, get those folks
out that yard!

29:17.850 --> 29:19.886
Chi, you gonna catch
a cold out here.

29:30.970 --> 29:35.134
It won't be long
before Ralph Angel
take Blue.

29:35.170 --> 29:37.468
He ain't listening
to a damn thing
I say about it.

29:37.500 --> 29:42.278
Now, Vi, you gotta let
Ralph Angel be that
boy's daddy.

29:42.310 --> 29:46.201
Ernest gone, they'll go.
I'm alone now.

29:46.250 --> 29:49.071
Baby, you are not alone.
You got Hollywood.

29:54.590 --> 29:57.980
If you still want kids,

29:58.030 --> 30:00.282
you need to find somebody
who can do that.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.298
Woman, what you
talking about?

30:02.330 --> 30:04.423
You good with Blue.

30:04.470 --> 30:08.395
It it ain't right for you
to waste _time with me
if you still want kids.

30:08.440 --> 30:12.433
No, see, you can't be
wasting time when you are
where you want to be.

30:12.470 --> 30:15.439
And baby...

30:15.480 --> 30:19.143
I am exactly
where I want to be.

30:22.950 --> 30:25.510
- Micah: Auntie Vi.
- ( door closes )

30:25.550 --> 30:27.882
Up here, baby.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.258
You guys
got a basketball?

30:33.290 --> 30:35.053
( laughing )
Yeah, we got a basketball.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.591
- What you think this is?
- Micah: Y'all good.

30:37.630 --> 30:39.996
- Tell my mom I'm at the gym.
I'll be back later.
- Hollywood: All right.

30:53.010 --> 30:56.013
Hey, man.

30:57.050 --> 30:59.610
I missed you.

31:04.630 --> 31:08.589
Listen, Micah,
you're too young
to understand

31:08.630 --> 31:10.928
what's really happening
right now, okay?

31:10.970 --> 31:14.394
- I just need you to--
- Just what? Trust you?

31:15.470 --> 31:17.495
Okay, I get it.

31:17.540 --> 31:19.963
You're mad.

31:20.010 --> 31:21.079
Son, I'm mad, too.

31:21.110 --> 31:23.078
Yeah,
for getting caught?

31:24.450 --> 31:25.940
For hurting Mom?
For what?

31:25.980 --> 31:28.619
I didn't do anything,
son.

31:28.650 --> 31:32.586
I'm gonna prove
that I'm innocent,
but right now is not the time.

31:32.620 --> 31:35.259
We can all talk
when we're back in LA.

31:35.290 --> 31:37.986
I love you.
I love your mom.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.089
And we're gonna get
through this, okay?

31:40.130 --> 31:42.121
Micah, let's go.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.492
So, you go behind my back,
and what,

31:44.530 --> 31:46.293
arrange to meet Micah?

31:46.330 --> 31:48.161
Well, you wouldn't answer
any of my calls.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.191
My texts.
I didn't know where
the hell you were.

31:50.240 --> 31:51.662
- You shouldn't have
come here.
- Wait a minute.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.132
Wait a minute.
Charley, wait a minute.

31:53.170 --> 31:55.206
- Keep moving.
- Wait, wait.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.639
Baby, I'm here
for you and Micah.

32:01.680 --> 32:06.413
- You just lost your father--
- Don't tell me what I lost.

32:06.450 --> 32:08.554
I loved Ernest.
You know that.

32:08.590 --> 32:10.979
I'm glad he died
before knowing
what you did.

32:12.990 --> 32:14.127
Charley,
I know how it looks,

32:14.160 --> 32:15.388
but you have
to let me explain.

32:15.430 --> 32:17.557
You need to leave.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.488
No, wait, not until
I pay my respects.

32:19.530 --> 32:21.395
- Ernest was my family, too.
- No!

32:21.440 --> 32:23.169
See, you don't get
to say that anymore.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.565
I'm gonna stay
and you're gonna hear me out.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.703
- Come on, come on.
- Listen!

32:26.740 --> 32:29.538
I'm not leaving my boy
behind, okay?
You understand that?

32:29.580 --> 32:32.549
No matter where we stand,
we'll do right by Micah.

32:32.580 --> 32:35.413
- Micah needs me.
- I don't need you.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.059
But I need you,
though.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.320
Hey, hey.

32:44.360 --> 32:45.486
Listen...

32:50.630 --> 32:54.464
This was the proudest day
of my life.

32:54.500 --> 32:55.467
It was one
of the proudest days

32:55.500 --> 32:58.606
of your grandpa's life.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.460
( chuckles )

33:00.510 --> 33:03.274
My first ring.

33:06.550 --> 33:09.075
You were just a baby, man,
still in diapers,

33:09.120 --> 33:12.112
sitting on Ernest's lap.

33:12.150 --> 33:15.654
Your mom beside you.

33:15.690 --> 33:19.421
Son, this ring means nothing
to me without you.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.621
Nothing without
your love and respect of me.

33:24.470 --> 33:28.031
Everything is not about you.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.118
( razor buzzing )

33:54.430 --> 33:56.728
I fixed a bologna sandwich
for you.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.489
Put it
on the kitchen table.

33:58.530 --> 34:01.363
I want a haircut.

34:01.400 --> 34:04.198
I barely got enough time
to give myself one.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.708
But it's for Mom.

34:12.350 --> 34:14.409
Go get your chair.

34:21.290 --> 34:23.554
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:23.590 --> 34:25.820
You're not off yet, darling.
I need you to stay here.

34:25.860 --> 34:28.749
- Pam's gonna cover for me.
- I need Pam on booth four.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.189
I can't stay.
I gotta get my son.

34:31.230 --> 34:33.391
You also got to get
a check to take care
of that son, right?

34:33.430 --> 34:36.831
I will put in extra time
next week, Anthony, I promise,
just not today.

34:36.870 --> 34:39.566
You either stay today,
or there won't be
a next week.

34:47.580 --> 34:50.276
Just set it right here.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.288
I got you.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.189
Make sure
that she sit up straight.

35:06.230 --> 35:08.630
All right, come on.

35:12.370 --> 35:13.462
The clippers are dull

35:13.510 --> 35:15.307
so I'm gonna have
to cut it low.

35:15.340 --> 35:17.638
- Is that cool
with you, buddy?
- Yup.

35:25.520 --> 35:28.785
Glad you finally
shaping that boy's hair up.

35:28.820 --> 35:31.618
Gonna look real nice
for the serwce.

35:31.660 --> 35:35.323
But it's for Mom.
She's coming today.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.294
You think
she'll like it?

35:41.670 --> 35:43.433
( scoffs )

35:45.640 --> 35:48.234
- I'll be right back, buddy.
- Okay.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.908
- Hang tight.
- Okay.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.614
You think having
that no count gal
watch Blue

36:02.660 --> 36:05.959
is better than him
coming With us?

36:05.990 --> 36:08.925
Look, I respect ya,

36:08.960 --> 36:11.963
and I appreciate everything
you do for us.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.697
But he's mine, all right?

36:15.740 --> 36:18.208
I don't want him
seeing no coffin,

36:18.240 --> 36:21.232
no grave, no death.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.908
He'll have enough
of that to come.

36:23.940 --> 36:28.718
Baby, coddling him
ain't doing him no favors.

36:30.680 --> 36:34.355
Ernest always regretted
all the coddling he did
With you.

36:34.390 --> 36:36.585
His only son,
up on a pedestal.

36:36.620 --> 36:39.783
It ain't right,
it ain't healthy.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.390
See how it turns out.

36:45.330 --> 36:49.232
Oh, yeah?
How's that? Hmm?

36:49.270 --> 36:52.307
Wrestling with the world.

36:52.340 --> 36:55.275
A world that ain't got
no pedestal for you.

37:02.980 --> 37:06.416
- ( honking )
- Shit.

37:06.450 --> 37:07.587
Thank you so much.

37:07.620 --> 37:09.713
Shit.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.216
Shit!

37:18.900 --> 37:22.392
She's coming, Pop.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.464
I gotta go
or I'm gonna be late.

37:26.510 --> 37:29.399
We gotta go, buddy.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.408
- Come on, get your coat.
- Five more minutes, please?

37:31.450 --> 37:35.318
Let's go say bye to Papa.
Come on.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.641
You just do
What you want,
don't you?

38:11.820 --> 38:14.380
The rest of us be damned.

38:25.570 --> 38:28.733
Wait. Charley, wait.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.837
Charley.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.079
Baby-- okay,
you were right.

38:37.110 --> 38:39.101
Everything's not
about me, okay?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.970
This isn't
about you or us.

38:41.010 --> 38:42.944
This is about Ernest.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.088
Only Ernest.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.088
Remy:
Ain't no secret

39:34.130 --> 39:37.531
Brother Ernest
wasn't no blind follower.

39:37.570 --> 39:41.609
He was just a man
Who lead by just being
true to himself.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.677
I knew it was gonna be hot
today so I begged him,

39:44.710 --> 39:46.701
I said, "Brother Ernest,"
I said,

39:46.750 --> 39:49.469
"please don't make
these brothers
do your serwce outdoors

39:49.520 --> 39:54.014
With these mosquitoes
and all this heat."

39:54.050 --> 39:56.883
He just said to me,
he said, "Brother Remy,

39:56.920 --> 39:59.821
you better get 'em
some fly swatters
and some patience.

40:01.730 --> 40:04.392
'Cause I'm going
on my own way."

40:06.630 --> 40:09.929
He just wanted to go home
near what he loved.

40:17.710 --> 40:20.144
Man:
"The evergreen,
Which once marked

40:20.180 --> 40:22.717
the temporary
resting place

40:22.750 --> 40:25.184
of the illustrious dead,

40:25.220 --> 40:29.987
is an emblem of our faith
in the immortality

40:30.020 --> 40:31.954
of the soul.

40:37.630 --> 40:40.827
By this,
we are reminded that we have

40:40.870 --> 40:44.658
an immortal heart
Within us...

40:48.740 --> 40:51.641
that shall survive
the grave,

40:53.850 --> 40:58.071
and which never,
never die."

41:00.120 --> 41:01.587
Man #2:
"The shadows of mortality

41:01.620 --> 41:04.589
and reveal
to our anCIent souls

41:04.630 --> 41:06.552
those serene heights
of joy and beauty,

41:06.590 --> 41:10.526
Whither, we trust,
our brother has ascended.

41:10.560 --> 41:13.222
As we consign his body
to the resting place

41:13.270 --> 41:16.091
may we realize
how weak and impotent

41:16.140 --> 41:19.064
every human arm,
and trust in Thy might alone

41:19.110 --> 41:21.977
for deliverance
from the domain of death.

41:22.010 --> 41:24.001
Grant
Thy sustaining grace

41:24.040 --> 41:26.076
to these mourners
and bereaved friends.

41:26.110 --> 41:29.876
May all find rest
and comfort in Thee,

41:29.920 --> 41:31.979
and, relying upon
Thine infinite love,

41:32.020 --> 41:34.238
- wait in patient hope--
- Ain't the time.

41:34.290 --> 41:36.986
...death to be
swallowed up in victory."

41:37.020 --> 41:38.089
Amen.

42:04.820 --> 42:07.744
Man:
And Genesis 3:19,

42:07.790 --> 42:10.281
by the sweat
of your face,

42:10.320 --> 42:13.050
you will eat bread
until you're in the ground.

42:13.090 --> 42:15.797
Why? Because that's where
we were taken.

42:15.830 --> 42:19.766
We are dust,
and dust we shall return.

42:24.240 --> 42:27.038
Amen, Brother Ernest.

42:27.070 --> 42:29.777
May you rest in peace.
