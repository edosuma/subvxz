00:00.190 --> 00:01.569
<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:01.609 --> 00:02.680
We're letting you go.

00:02.719 --> 00:03.820
–Why?
–You're fat.

00:03.860 --> 00:06.190
So if I was thin, I…
I'd still have my job?

00:06.230 --> 00:08.000
If you were thin, I'd probably
try and have sex with you.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.040
Wait, no, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.330
I've been damaged. We'll
see you all in court.

00:11.370 --> 00:13.580
She's not coming back
to a firm of fat bigots.

00:13.620 --> 00:14.700
Are you this hostile in bed?

00:14.740 --> 00:17.830
Keep talking, Mr Crane. All I
hear is ca-ching, ca-ching, ca-ching.

00:17.870 --> 00:18.596
You're fat.

00:18.620 --> 00:20.460
Off you go now. Take
the man-eater with you.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.090
My name is Leigh Swift.

00:22.170 --> 00:25.330
And I am here today in hopes
of securing legal counsel.

00:25.370 --> 00:26.500
–Hello.
–Hello.

00:26.570 --> 00:29.078
Would you like to get a drink with me?

00:38.540 --> 00:39.530
Jerry, come on.

00:39.580 --> 00:42.260
You need to keep reminding
yourself that this is a good thing.

00:42.300 --> 00:42.920
No, it's not.

00:42.960 --> 00:43.530
Jerry.

00:43.630 --> 00:44.540
Please don't use my name.

00:44.580 --> 00:47.520
When you say my name, it reminds me
who I am, which is Jerry Espenson,

00:47.560 --> 00:49.730
which is not a good thing to
be at all in this situation.

00:49.770 --> 00:51.370
Okay, first, stop pacing.
It's driving me—

00:51.410 --> 00:52.810
Stay!

00:55.030 --> 00:57.580
You've had two wonderful dates.

00:57.690 --> 01:01.990
And we all know what's supposed
to happen on the third date after
two wonderful dates, don't we?

01:02.030 --> 01:04.510
You've really never kissed a woman?

01:04.580 --> 01:05.590
Not a real one.

01:05.670 --> 01:08.190
Well, it's actually quite simple.

01:08.290 --> 01:13.480
You just move your head towards
hers until your lips touch.

01:13.560 --> 01:17.430
Well, what about the tongue business?
What am I supposed to do about that?

01:17.470 --> 01:19.260
You just sort of...

01:19.350 --> 01:23.980
slip it in and, you know,
move it around a little.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.950
Oh, well. Shouldn't you
just write the book?

01:25.990 --> 01:29.070
Jerry, the thing about a first kiss,

01:29.160 --> 01:32.850
the combination of the psychological
and physical stimuli can be overwhelming.

01:32.890 --> 01:34.690
It's best to separate the two.

01:34.730 --> 01:37.170
That would be helpful if I
had any idea what you said.

01:37.210 --> 01:38.360
Look.

01:38.450 --> 01:39.870
You're standing at the
door with your date.

01:39.910 --> 01:42.410
–Lorraine.
–Alan, please.

01:43.920 --> 01:48.470
You look into her eyes, you
hold each other's gaze.

01:48.550 --> 01:50.790
You're essentially kissing now.

01:50.880 --> 01:58.410
Not physically, but you're both saying
with eye contact how much you long
for the taste of each other's lips.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.390
You moisten your own lips
gently with your tongue.

02:02.490 --> 02:08.590
A simple kiss now almost seems like
nothing, and yet, it's everything.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.020
Because there is nothing…

02:10.060 --> 02:14.810
nothing… so gentle as that first kiss.

02:30.570 --> 02:32.310
Jerry?

02:33.440 --> 02:35.430
Jerry left us.

02:36.750 --> 02:37.730
It's only a kiss, man.

02:37.770 --> 02:39.070
It's not just a kiss.

02:39.110 --> 02:41.390
That's the thing about
Lorraine, it's never just a kiss.

02:41.430 --> 02:45.480
She… I swear, she actually
makes my tongue change color.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.090
Let me see.

02:48.300 --> 02:50.050
It's normal color.

02:50.060 --> 02:51.750
Not the tip.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.150
It's bluish.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.260
It's the normal color.

02:56.330 --> 02:57.710
It's a bit puffy, though.

02:57.750 --> 02:59.740
Is it swollen? It's a bit puffy.

02:59.780 --> 03:00.990
Oh, sweet.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.400
It's the fat bigot and his
friend Mr Puffy tongue.

03:04.510 --> 03:06.700
I don't believe we've officially met.

03:06.740 --> 03:08.970
$1 million, nothing structured.

03:09.050 --> 03:13.100
As I understand it, your client was
offered her job back within an hour.

03:13.140 --> 03:15.800
Oh, gee. You're right.
You got me there.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.450
$1 million.

03:17.910 --> 03:19.100
I'm Alan Shore.

03:19.190 --> 03:20.770
$1 million.

03:20.860 --> 03:23.960
How about instead, I bite you on the
inner thigh? Does that work for you?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.860
If only I'd really said that, but
you, of course, misheard me.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.210
Just as your client misheard Denny.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.540
Is that your defense?

03:30.580 --> 03:32.960
He didn't really fire her
for being fat?

03:33.000 --> 03:36.170
Miss. I'm sure you have a name,
but I'm not much interested.

03:36.210 --> 03:38.960
I've taken an immediate dislike to
you. I'm sure you get that a lot.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.240
Where I was once prepared
to be generous, now I'm not.

03:42.280 --> 03:46.200
You've made the strategic
mistake of pissing me off.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.860
You scare me.

03:47.950 --> 03:49.990
See me shudder?

03:50.050 --> 03:51.780
Take your clothes off.
I'll make you shudder.

03:51.820 --> 03:53.870
That I did say.

03:54.510 --> 03:58.720
Your hostility is just a barely
concealed form of foreplay.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.970
I knew it. You're a
horny, insatiable little slut.

04:02.010 --> 04:04.020
I could smell it the
second you walked in.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.890
Well, I'm happy to oblige.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.420
Let's you and I
make like rabbits.

Boston Legal
Season 4 Episode 7
Attack Of The Xenophobes

04:43.330 --> 04:46.430
I realize this is
unbelievably late notice.

04:46.510 --> 04:47.720
When does your trial start?

04:47.760 --> 04:49.470
Today, actually.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.880
Look, I-I just had a knockdown
blowout with my lawyer.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.810
Now he's out, and I-I'm desperate.

04:53.850 --> 04:56.630
Let's back up. Uh, what
is your trial about?

04:56.670 --> 04:58.260
I'm being charged with murder.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.200
Mm, something simple then.

05:00.270 --> 05:02.052
Look, I'm a police officer.

05:02.180 --> 05:04.050
Well, I was. They fired me.

05:04.110 --> 05:07.210
I shot an unarmed man,
mistaking him for a suspect.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.768
I thought he had a gun.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.670
Turned out to be a soda
can the light caught funny.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.660
Anyway, it was a mistake.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.850
But the DA is saying otherwise.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.010
The thing is, they took
an MRI of my brain.

05:19.210 --> 05:20.930
Why?

05:21.470 --> 05:24.530
The man I shot was
african-american, and, uh,

05:24.630 --> 05:28.160
the district attorney's saying
the shooting's racially motivated.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.230
Look, I had a couple of incidents
at work where I had to go get,

05:30.270 --> 05:33.780
you know, sensitivity training
and so forth, but I'm not a racist.

05:33.820 --> 05:35.450
Wait.

05:35.540 --> 05:40.600
So they took a scan of your brain to see
if the shooting was racially motivated?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.750
Yeah, they called it a functional MRI.

05:42.790 --> 05:47.872
I've read that they can evidently detect
a predisposition toward racial bias.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.200
And did it, with you?

05:51.690 --> 05:53.540
Yes.

05:53.660 --> 05:58.280
They plan to use it as evidence to
convict me of second-degree murder.

06:09.190 --> 06:10.780
Well, you were worse than me.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.110
I just…

06:12.200 --> 06:17.580
between my agitation over Lorraine
and this Emma's repugnance…

06:17.690 --> 06:21.160
I think she was prepared to have sex, though.
I could've been right on the money there.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.520
So now what happens?

06:22.610 --> 06:28.022
Well, she's noticed your deposition. After
that, I'll bring our motion to dismiss.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.630
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said, denny.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.640
Oh, I'm glad to hear that.

06:32.740 --> 06:33.630
What'd I say?

06:33.750 --> 06:36.930
You said that maybe
Lorraine is the one for me.

06:37.030 --> 06:42.030
Maybe that's why I can't
shake the neck… or… the kiss.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.060
Maybe I just can't shake her.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.770
Maybe Lorraine's it.

06:47.850 --> 06:49.360
I said that?

06:49.460 --> 06:50.560
What's the big deal, Jerry?

06:50.600 --> 06:52.100
–Have you ever kissed a girl?
–Yes.

06:52.140 --> 06:52.970
As you or Clevant?

06:53.010 --> 06:54.760
I kissed Claire as me.

06:54.850 --> 06:56.764
–I don't believe you.
–I did.

06:57.030 --> 06:57.650
Hello.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.320
–Hello.
–Hello.

06:59.580 --> 07:04.070
Clarence, I'm ashamed to admit
I've been googling myself again.

07:04.150 --> 07:05.710
It happens when Shirley's
out of town.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.750
And I've been on YouTube again.

07:07.790 --> 07:11.060
Do you know what's playing now?

07:11.150 --> 07:13.300
That was not… oh, a minister?

07:13.310 --> 07:13.980
A preacher?

07:14.020 --> 07:15.730
Are you a man dressed as a woman?

07:15.770 --> 07:17.610
He stole my parking place.

07:19.210 --> 07:22.910
I was getting ready to back in, then
he whooshed in with his sports car,

07:22.950 --> 07:25.370
then he called me names and…

07:26.330 --> 07:28.330
I just lost it.

07:28.410 --> 07:29.690
You weirdo. You pervert.

07:29.730 --> 07:30.700
Oh, you know what else you can do?

07:30.740 --> 07:32.660
You can kiss my ass.
That's what you can do.

07:32.700 --> 07:33.820
Take a look at this here.

07:33.860 --> 07:35.770
Oh! Oh, his image, Mr Minister.

07:35.810 --> 07:38.020
Kiss it! His image!

07:38.030 --> 07:40.970
Take a good kiss of that,
Mr Minister!

07:41.890 --> 07:44.190
Okay, several issues.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.700
First, you're terrorizing clergy.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.320
That's something we frown on.

07:49.360 --> 07:53.460
Second, you likened your
buttocks to God's image.

07:53.530 --> 07:56.130
Very politically incorrect
even in a blue state.

07:56.170 --> 08:01.340
And you managed to do so on
the world wide web as an employee
of Crane, Poole & Schmidt,

08:01.380 --> 08:09.810
which means that your exposed ass…
not only speaks to the Almighty's image,
but ours.

08:16.010 --> 08:17.220
Take a look at this here.

08:17.260 --> 08:20.758
Take a look at this here.
Oh, his image, Mr Minister.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.490
I wasn't watching anything.

08:23.580 --> 08:25.270
I expected better from you.

08:25.310 --> 08:26.420
Me?

08:26.540 --> 08:28.550
Your conduct leaves
a little to be desired.

08:28.590 --> 08:30.040
Hello.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.500
Leigh, hello. Leigh, hello.

08:32.539 --> 08:34.429
I was just in the neighborhood.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.299
I thought, what the hey?

08:36.380 --> 08:38.380
What a surprise. Hey. Hello.

08:39.549 --> 08:41.390
This is Clarence. You remember Leigh.

08:41.429 --> 08:42.150
Hello.

08:42.220 --> 08:43.909
Hello.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.240
All set for tonight?

08:45.300 --> 08:46.610
Tonight.

08:46.670 --> 08:49.310
Well, uh, something's come up, actually.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.870
It looks like I have
to work late tonight.

08:51.910 --> 08:54.290
Oh, okay.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.780
–Tomorrow night?
–Yes.

08:58.170 --> 09:01.520
Well, this case could be consuming,
this one that just came up.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.700
Maybe we should postpone
till the weekend.

09:03.740 --> 09:06.440
Oh, okay.

09:06.550 --> 09:08.910
Good-bye.

09:08.990 --> 09:11.200
Good-bye.

09:12.850 --> 09:14.810
What came up? Nothing's come up.

09:14.850 --> 09:15.510
Did I ask you?

09:15.550 --> 09:16.930
You're just afraid
you'll have to kiss her.

09:16.970 --> 09:18.590
Don't be such a buttinskyhead.

09:18.630 --> 09:20.000
You hurt her feelings.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.290
I said I didn't ask you, you…

09:23.810 --> 09:25.520
poop!

09:30.780 --> 09:32.630
All rise.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.120
This court is now in session.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.000
The honorable judge
Gloria Weldon presiding.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.720
Be seated.

09:40.540 --> 09:41.840
Good morning, your honor.

09:41.880 --> 09:45.240
Whitney Rome along with Katie Lloyd of
Crane, Poole & Schmidt for the defense.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.360
Your motion is denied.

09:47.430 --> 09:49.050
I haven't even told you what it is yet.

09:49.090 --> 09:51.334
You seek to suppress the MRI scan.

09:51.340 --> 09:55.000
Mr Bass' previous counsel already
brought such a motion to suppress.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.800
The issue was ruled on.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.400
Your honor, come on.

09:58.510 --> 10:00.440
A brain scan to read his thoughts?

10:00.480 --> 10:02.480
Assuming these things
are even accurate—

10:02.520 --> 10:03.450
No.

10:03.530 --> 10:06.302
It reads chemical
responses, not thoughts.

10:06.340 --> 10:10.110
And we already make suspects give
blood, DNA, handwriting analysis.

10:10.150 --> 10:11.866
Those are objective tests.

10:11.900 --> 10:13.470
So is the brain scan.

10:13.570 --> 10:16.000
I'm allowing it. What else?

10:16.010 --> 10:19.050
–We also have a motion for a contin—
–Denied.

10:19.090 --> 10:20.250
Wait, we've just got this.

10:20.290 --> 10:23.250
Too late. Denied. We start today.

10:25.060 --> 10:26.870
Your honor…

10:27.290 --> 10:32.240
maybe in the interest of justice, we
should put our conflicts on the table.

10:32.300 --> 10:32.940
Meaning?

10:33.050 --> 10:38.170
Meaning there may be some bad blood
between you and my firm, and it—

10:38.280 --> 10:42.620
Mr Palmer, I once had a relationship
with a lawyer at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

10:42.660 --> 10:44.630
Do you object?
–Not at all.

10:44.660 --> 10:45.980
Well, my client objects.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.610
Tell your client the affair
wasn't very memorable.

10:49.710 --> 10:53.740
And if I had to recuse myself
from every case where I'd slept
with one of the lawyers,

10:53.780 --> 10:56.530
or both, I'd have to take up golf.

10:56.610 --> 11:01.626
I'll give you one hour to get yourself
ready, then I'm bringing in the jury.

11:03.860 --> 11:06.170
Okay.

11:09.990 --> 11:13.980
Listen to me, Denny, answer only what
you're asked, do not throw in little, uh,

11:14.020 --> 11:20.230
comments or asides, and above all, do
not, do not, do not offer your opinions.

11:20.340 --> 11:22.780
Will you relax, man? It's
me you're talking to.

11:22.820 --> 11:23.960
Dear God.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.890
–Alan.
–Lorraine.

11:25.950 --> 11:27.670
I was just leaving.

11:33.770 --> 11:35.280
Lorraine.

11:35.380 --> 11:38.800
I was just, uh, thinking
about you earlier.

11:38.910 --> 11:40.950
Really? Tell me.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.620
Well…

11:47.310 --> 11:53.650
you know how, uh, both of us seem
to be so relationship averse?

11:53.810 --> 11:56.290
I was thinking…

11:56.970 --> 12:02.120
maybe you are, uh, right
for a longer-term…

12:02.220 --> 12:04.150
thing.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.620
Funny.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.630
Who told you?

12:07.700 --> 12:08.820
Told me?

12:08.880 --> 12:11.320
That I'm a relationship.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.260
I was planning to tell you.

12:14.350 --> 12:15.940
You're in a relationship.

12:15.980 --> 12:19.660
Yeah, a really wonderful man.

12:19.770 --> 12:21.900
I think you'd like him.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.980
Oh, I'm s…

12:24.190 --> 12:26.060
not sure.

12:26.170 --> 12:28.460
Anyway, I-I-I thought
you'd be relieved.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.170
We've decided to make it exclusive.

12:30.210 --> 12:34.300
So you won't have to worry
about me stalking you anymore.

12:36.370 --> 12:38.740
Terrific.

12:42.610 --> 12:45.180
We had just came out the deli.

12:45.320 --> 12:49.260
And BJ went back in because he
forgot his soda on the counter.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.230
I kept walking to the car.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.220
BJ is your brother.

12:53.290 --> 12:54.910
Yes.

12:55.010 --> 12:59.390
Then as I got to the car, this
cop car comes screeching up,

12:59.480 --> 13:02.530
and two cops jump out, screaming.

13:02.610 --> 13:05.410
And they had their guns pointed at BJ.

13:05.470 --> 13:07.540
Then what?

13:07.920 --> 13:10.820
They just shot him.

13:11.060 --> 13:13.500
He shot him.

13:13.720 --> 13:18.070
He just kept shooting and shooting.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.430
It was like he unloaded the whole gun.

13:26.370 --> 13:29.870
I'm very sorry for your loss, Terrence.

13:30.660 --> 13:33.380
When the police arrived
and leapt from the car,

13:33.420 --> 13:35.330
what did you do, if I may ask?

13:35.370 --> 13:38.030
I just hit the ground.

13:38.390 --> 13:40.270
And did you actually see
your brother get shot,

13:40.310 --> 13:43.790
or did you first hear the
shots and then look up?

13:43.870 --> 13:45.110
Both.

13:45.180 --> 13:51.580
I first heard the shots, and then I
looked up and saw him getting shot.

13:51.650 --> 13:54.030
Thank you.

14:00.490 --> 14:02.380
Once again, tightly constructed answers.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.380
There's no room for
opinions, especially yours.

14:04.420 --> 14:05.278
What's wrong?

14:05.310 --> 14:05.980
Nothing's wrong.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.330
You're being surly. I can hear it.

14:07.370 --> 14:08.360
–I am not surly.
–Yes, you are.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.510
Whatever it is, I—
–Nothing's wrong!

14:10.550 --> 14:12.920
That hurt my feelings.

14:14.510 --> 14:16.380
She's involved.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.930
Who?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.720
Lorraine. She has a boyfriend.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.120
I never liked her.

14:21.210 --> 14:22.690
Did she say who?

14:22.770 --> 14:24.330
No, and I don't care.

14:24.410 --> 14:25.990
Jerry.

14:26.050 --> 14:27.100
Leigh.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.990
Hello. Welcome.

14:29.050 --> 14:30.600
I'm very unsettled.

14:30.700 --> 14:34.320
If you don't want to date me
anymore, please just be honest with me.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.300
I'm 44 years old, I've
heard every excuse there is.

14:37.340 --> 14:41.480
The last one said he got summoned for
astronaut duty and had to rush off for the moon.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.760
I'm sick of dishonest, disingenuous men.

14:44.850 --> 14:47.460
And people wonder how I could
end up with a utility box.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.688
You dishonest man!

14:48.750 --> 14:52.930
Hey, lady, I tried to let you down
nicely, and you punish me for it.

14:52.970 --> 14:54.920
What, I should have opted for cruelty?

14:54.960 --> 14:57.730
What do you want from me?

15:03.050 --> 15:05.310
They even fight weird.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.740
Come on, Denny. Let's go.

15:07.770 --> 15:12.860
We were responding to a call that
a man matching the description of
the suspect was seen going into the deli.

15:12.900 --> 15:15.930
When we arrived, we saw Mr
Owens and his brother emerging.

15:15.970 --> 15:17.780
We identified ourselves
as police officers,

15:17.820 --> 15:19.930
drew our weapons and asked
them to get on the ground.

15:19.970 --> 15:20.830
Then what?

15:20.900 --> 15:24.220
Well, I looked at Terrence, the
younger brother, over by the car.

15:24.260 --> 15:25.540
Then I heard the shots.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.900
I looked back to see my
partner firing at BJ.

15:27.940 --> 15:30.440
–And yet, you didn't shoot.
–No.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.270
In fact, you said to the, uh,

15:32.310 --> 15:36.480
field investigation division that
you thought the shoot was reckless.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.370
I thought it was a quick shoot.

15:38.410 --> 15:40.930
I never said it was racially motivated.

15:40.970 --> 15:46.060
Officer Payne, how long have you
and the defendant been partners?

15:46.140 --> 15:47.260
Three years.

15:47.340 --> 15:49.720
–He's your friend.
–Yes.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.590
Ever have reason to
think that he's a racist?

15:52.630 --> 15:53.290
–No.

15:53.380 --> 15:58.300
Really? You never complained about him?

15:58.640 --> 16:01.640
When we were first deployed
together, I didn't know him.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.360
He made a few comments that upset me.

16:03.400 --> 16:09.200
Like he “only believed
in busing for away games”?

16:09.960 --> 16:12.620
His sense of humor is
sometimes misplaced.

16:12.660 --> 16:14.350
But he's not a racist.

16:14.450 --> 16:15.780
BJ…

16:15.860 --> 16:18.660
the brother who was
mistaken for the suspect…

16:18.700 --> 16:21.050
did he in fact look like that suspect?

16:21.090 --> 16:24.490
We only had a general
description, but yes, he did match it.

16:24.530 --> 16:29.680
And that suspect was reported
as being armed and dangerous.

16:29.760 --> 16:30.990
Yes.

16:31.070 --> 16:33.510
Thank you.

16:41.400 --> 16:45.680
F-first of all, I apologize
for embarrassing the law firm.

16:45.790 --> 16:50.330
It's not like me to lose
my temper like that, and…

16:50.690 --> 16:53.630
I am very sorry.

16:53.970 --> 16:55.860
Uh, second, uh…

16:58.050 --> 16:59.400
I sued them.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.980
–Sued who?
–YouTube.

17:02.060 --> 17:05.228
It was wrong for them to
humiliate me like that.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.400
I'll represent myself but—

17:06.440 --> 17:07.619
You don't really have a case.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.609
What they did was wrong.

17:09.690 --> 17:10.760
I can't let it go. I—

17:10.800 --> 17:16.420
Clarence, certainly you've heard
the saying, any man who represents
himself has a drag queen for a client.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.890
Wait, no. That's not the saying.

17:17.930 --> 17:19.700
Clarence!

17:25.369 --> 17:26.960
Let me represent you.

17:27.040 --> 17:31.540
I agree, what they did
was wrong. I'll help you.

17:31.590 --> 17:33.600
You don't have to do that.

17:33.660 --> 17:40.500
I want to, and, son, I'm very good.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.980
All rise.

17:51.030 --> 17:54.700
This court is now in session. The
honorable judge Brown presiding.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.480
Be seated.

18:03.070 --> 18:04.220
All right.

18:04.320 --> 18:12.410
Before we begin, some of you may
or may not have noticed that
I'm wearing protective headgear.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.460
I sustained a small
wound while gardening.

18:15.540 --> 18:19.630
My doctor advised that I take conservative
precautions until the stitches are removed.

18:19.670 --> 18:22.600
Please pay it no attention.

18:22.690 --> 18:24.480
Your honor, I think we
can make this quick.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.670
Mr Bell is alleging
defamation of character.

18:26.710 --> 18:30.130
The footage depicts what actually happened,
and truth is a complete defense to defamation.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.010
This is silly.

18:31.050 --> 18:32.910
We're also suing under
right to publicity.

18:32.950 --> 18:35.820
The plaintiff is not a celebrity.
We get no value trading on his name.

18:35.860 --> 18:39.130
You get value trading
on footage depicting him.

18:39.230 --> 18:45.830
I direct you to Massachusetts
law, chapter 214, section 3a.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.730
I'm sorry.

18:48.850 --> 18:52.080
I'm finding it very difficult
to get past the helmet.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.240
I am a superior court jurist,

18:54.350 --> 18:58.290
and I expect to be treated with the
respect that goes with this robe.

18:58.330 --> 19:01.310
I do not sit up here
for your amusement.

19:01.410 --> 19:03.400
Even so…

19:04.650 --> 19:11.370
Judge, the v-video was aired without a
context, so it does not represent the truth.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.580
I'd like to hear exactly
how he's been defamed.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.410
You can read how in the complaint.

19:15.450 --> 19:16.836
It is a fair request.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.920
Mr Bell.

19:19.070 --> 19:22.750
You will take the stand after lunch.

19:27.060 --> 19:29.900
The helmet threw me.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.270
And you just thought you had the
right to fire her 'cause she was fat?

19:34.310 --> 19:35.950
And still is.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.790
I thought I had the right to fire
people who jeopardize my health.

19:38.830 --> 19:41.990
How does her weight
jeopardize your health?

19:42.070 --> 19:45.130
According to studies at Harvard—
you've heard of Harvard?

19:45.170 --> 19:48.270
Obesity can spread like
a contagious disease.

19:48.370 --> 19:49.980
That's not my opinion.
That's Harvard's.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.810
But I wasn't too fat for you to hit on?

19:51.850 --> 19:54.920
Oh, no. 'Cause I like chubby sex.
But I never asked you to dinner.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.210
Did you hear that?

19:56.320 --> 19:58.170
I only heard
ca-ching, ca-ching.

19:58.210 --> 20:00.080
–I have nothing against the chinese.
–Denny.

20:00.120 --> 20:03.700
So are you firing all the heavy
people at Crane, Poole & Schmidt?

20:03.740 --> 20:05.840
Well, I had to start
someplace. I started with her.

20:05.880 --> 20:06.590
Ca-ching.

20:06.680 --> 20:09.780
And let's just suppose, say, my client
did agree to have sex with you.

20:09.820 --> 20:10.990
Too late. I've moved on.

20:11.030 --> 20:13.470
Would you have fired her
had she not rejected you?

20:13.510 --> 20:16.670
I fired her because according
to the Harvard studies,

20:16.710 --> 20:21.610
the social influence of fat people
can be just as damaging as genetics.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.000
I tried to explain that to your client, but
her ears were too stuffed with twinkies.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.390
on their way in or
out, I-I couldn't be sure.

20:27.430 --> 20:29.300
Ca-ching.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.080
What?

20:32.350 --> 20:35.100
It's called functional
magnetic resonance imaging.

20:35.140 --> 20:37.140
What does it do?

20:37.230 --> 20:45.220
Well, in basic terms, it's a tool that allows us
to visualize brain function by showing changes
in blood flow and other metabolic processes.

20:45.260 --> 20:47.110
You can tell what someone is thinking?

20:47.150 --> 20:49.140
We can tell how someone is feeling,

20:49.180 --> 20:54.720
and we can specifically identify responses
associated with sociopathic tendencies.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.180
Here, we determined the
defendant was racist.

20:57.220 --> 20:59.690
You can really measure
this with accuracy?

20:59.730 --> 21:01.220
Extreme accuracy.

21:01.280 --> 21:04.540
In this case, we showed Mr Bass
pictures of people from various races,

21:04.580 --> 21:08.860
and then we measured the response in
the part of his brain that controls fear.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.260
It's called the amygdala.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.570
And what did it reveal?

21:12.650 --> 21:16.190
Officer bass perceives
black men as threatening.

21:16.270 --> 21:20.032
Possible he would be more
trigger-happy with a black man?

21:20.110 --> 21:22.220
Absolutely.

21:22.300 --> 21:26.290
How long have these tests been
used to read people's minds?

21:26.390 --> 21:30.810
They read responses, not minds,
but the answer is a long time.

21:30.920 --> 21:34.800
And here, they told you Jeffrey Bass
fears black men more than white.

21:34.840 --> 21:35.850
Unquestionably.

21:35.940 --> 21:39.710
Are you familiar with
shooter bias tests, professor?

21:39.810 --> 21:43.380
They're video games with white
characters and black characters,

21:43.420 --> 21:46.800
and the characters reach for
either guns or cell phones,

21:46.840 --> 21:49.430
and you're supposed to only
shoot the ones with guns.

21:49.470 --> 21:55.010
And do these tests reveal that
white officers more readily fire
on blacks than black police officers?

21:55.050 --> 21:56.230
No.

21:56.330 --> 21:58.930
Shooter bias tests have
generally concluded that,

21:58.970 --> 22:05.710
in this country, everyone
shoots black people faster.

22:06.570 --> 22:09.900
Focus on the images. This
should only take about a minute.

22:09.940 --> 22:11.690
Okay.

22:16.950 --> 22:19.120
Why are we doing this?

22:19.220 --> 22:24.570
If our scan gets different results, then
we can impeach the validity of theirs.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.220
And he's seeing what we're seeing?
–Yes.

22:39.680 --> 22:43.112
I don't think our scan is
getting different results.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.552
<i>You can kiss my ass.</i>

22:52.560 --> 22:53.820
<i>That's what you can do.
Well, you're a weirdo.</i>

22:53.860 --> 22:56.380
<i>Take a look at this here.
Oh, his image, Mr Minister.</i>

22:56.420 --> 22:58.830
<i>Kiss that right there! His image!</i>

22:58.870 --> 23:02.250
<i>Take a good kiss of that, Mr Minister!</i>

23:02.720 --> 23:04.910
Outrageous.

23:05.370 --> 23:09.210
Mr Bell, the footage fairly and accurately
depicts what happened, doesn't it?

23:09.250 --> 23:12.010
Yes, but it doesn't tell the whole story.

23:12.110 --> 23:14.530
–Have you gone out in public
dressed as a woman before?
–Yes.

23:14.570 --> 23:17.230
–In fact, you once joined an all-girls
gym, isn't that correct? –Yes.

23:17.270 --> 23:20.440
You recently signed up for a singing
contest in drag. You've gone to work in drag.

23:20.480 --> 23:25.210
But that moment, without a
context, makes me look like…

23:25.310 --> 23:27.330
You're a lawyer.

23:27.340 --> 23:27.890
I am.

23:27.940 --> 23:31.160
–Are you familiar with section 230
of the communications decency act,
–Yes, but—

23:31.200 --> 23:34.540
…which expressly protects online
services from defamation liability

23:34.580 --> 23:37.400
arising from material posted
on their sites by individuals?

23:37.440 --> 23:40.410
Your honor, this was an
extremely embarrassing event,

23:40.450 --> 23:45.010
aired worldwide on a web site, absent
the context that occasioned it.

23:45.090 --> 23:48.140
The… the footage depicts what happened.

23:48.140 --> 23:50.510
So where's the damage?

23:50.610 --> 23:53.210
Your honor, think of it.

23:53.290 --> 23:58.450
We've all had a meltdown or two, a-a
mortifying episode of some sort.

23:58.530 --> 24:00.890
Typically we're allowed
to live those moments down.

24:00.930 --> 24:04.430
But now thanks to the internet, we can't.

24:04.530 --> 24:08.080
Suppose I taped you
as justice Bubblehead.

24:08.170 --> 24:09.390
Put that thing down.

24:09.430 --> 24:13.456
–How would you like to be defined?
–Put it down this instant!

24:14.570 --> 24:22.970
My point is, life's little embarrassing
moments are now having far-reaching
and more devastating consequences.

24:23.090 --> 24:32.260
If the day has come that we are going to be publicly
and globally shamed by our foolish missteps,
then the laws of defamation should keep pace.

24:32.300 --> 24:38.440
Certainly when these tort laws were
drafted, the legislators never contemplated.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.080
YouTube.

24:50.070 --> 24:52.200
I repeated my command to freeze.

24:52.300 --> 24:59.000
This time he did, but then he started to
raise his hand, and in it was a metal object.

24:59.110 --> 25:01.220
I thought it was a
gun, and I just reacted.

25:01.260 --> 25:05.180
You know now he was probably
raising his hands in surrender.

25:05.220 --> 25:07.350
Yes…

25:07.460 --> 25:09.610
but at the time…

25:09.870 --> 25:11.760
I thought it was a gun.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.020
Do you work in a pretty
tough neighborhood, Mr Bass?

25:14.060 --> 25:15.480
Yes, it's a gang neighborhood.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.028
And have you ever been
shot at before?

25:18.040 --> 25:19.770
Three times.

25:19.910 --> 25:23.690
Have you ever shot
anybody, besides B J Owens?

25:24.080 --> 25:25.580
Twice.

25:26.170 --> 25:28.460
What color were they?

25:28.950 --> 25:30.990
I patrol a predominately black area.

25:31.030 --> 25:35.240
So the two you previously
shot were black?

25:35.790 --> 25:36.390
Yes.

25:36.490 --> 25:40.900
And according to internal affairs' reports,
one of the suspects was also unarmed.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.710
I was cleared of any wrongdoing.

25:42.750 --> 25:43.820
It was an innocent mistake.

25:43.860 --> 25:47.850
Another mistake? Well, have you
ever mistakenly shot a white person?

25:47.890 --> 25:50.080
–Objection.
–Sustained.

25:50.730 --> 25:55.070
According to the FMRI, you feel
more threatened by black people.

25:55.150 --> 25:57.520
Why do you think that is?

25:57.970 --> 26:01.650
Look, if that test is accurate,

26:02.390 --> 26:06.730
it could be because statistically,
blacks commit more violent crimes…

26:06.770 --> 26:10.080
it could be because I been shot
at three times by black suspects.

26:10.120 --> 26:12.140
Or maybe you just
dislike black people.

26:12.180 --> 26:13.640
No, I do not.

26:13.760 --> 26:14.700
I'm not a racist.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.654
But you shot him eight times.

26:16.740 --> 26:18.110
–Mrs Owens…
–You just shot him till he was dead.

26:18.150 --> 26:20.120
You kept shooting and shooting and shooting!
–Mrs Owens, I will have you—

26:20.160 --> 26:21.410
–You murdered my baby!
–Mom, calm down.

26:21.450 --> 26:23.250
–You murderer!
–Mrs Owens…

26:23.670 --> 26:28.650
any more such outbursts, and you
will be removed from this courtroom.

26:33.580 --> 26:35.690
Just let me do all the talking,
Denny, every word.

26:35.730 --> 26:37.910
Do not even move your lips
without checking with me first.

26:37.950 --> 26:39.760
All rise.

26:47.140 --> 26:48.170
You can't be serious.

26:48.210 --> 26:51.450
Judas priest, she's the
size of an elephant.

26:55.830 --> 26:57.830
Be seated.

27:00.030 --> 27:02.100
Okay, I'll hear from the petitioner.

27:02.140 --> 27:08.160
No, before we get to that, your honor,
uh, Alan Shore representing Denny Crane.

27:08.290 --> 27:10.630
I-I have
a-a motion.

27:10.710 --> 27:12.480
Let's hear it.

27:14.750 --> 27:20.890
Uh, your honor, uh, perhaps you are not
the right jurist to be objective on this one.

27:20.990 --> 27:23.430
What do you mean?

27:25.540 --> 27:28.312
His tongue is tied
for two reasons, judge.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.730
First, it's puffy.

27:30.810 --> 27:34.730
And second, it's a challenge
for him to spin this.

27:34.810 --> 27:39.360
Denny Crane fired Nancy Wilding
because she was fat.

27:39.440 --> 27:43.360
It is bigotry in its purest,
most evil form.

27:43.430 --> 27:48.740
Fat people in this country are subject
to prejudice, emotional abuse and ridicule.

27:48.780 --> 27:52.140
It starts on the playground,
and it never stops.

27:52.220 --> 27:54.790
This woman didn't get asked
to her high school prom.

27:54.830 --> 27:57.210
Waiters and waitresses ignore her.

27:57.290 --> 27:59.960
She's been denied housing, insurance.

28:00.030 --> 28:02.340
Airlines want to charge her double.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.120
But Nancy Wilding didn't sit in a
corner and feel sorry for herself.

28:06.160 --> 28:09.200
She said,“hey, I'm gonna use my brain.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.336
I'm gonna study.

28:10.410 --> 28:11.860
I'm gonna go to law school.”

28:11.900 --> 28:12.960
And she did.

28:13.080 --> 28:16.640
And she graduated near the top
of her class, she passed the bar,

28:16.680 --> 28:22.340
she performed ably and successfully
as a lawyer, and where did it all get her?

28:22.420 --> 28:24.750
Fired for being fat.

28:24.870 --> 28:29.270
Somebody somewhere has
finally got to say enough.

28:29.360 --> 28:33.850
Nancy Wilding is hoping
that person is you.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.270
I'll take it under advisement.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.560
Uh, wait, wait.
You didn't hear from me.

28:40.600 --> 28:44.780
I'll take it under advisement. I'll
hear you before I read my ruling.

28:44.820 --> 28:47.300
Judge, I don't think that's
how it's supposed to work.

28:47.340 --> 28:49.230
Whatever.

28:57.580 --> 28:59.560
–This is not going well, Alan.
–You think?

28:59.600 --> 29:01.514
She won't even hear our side.

29:01.570 --> 29:03.760
Hopefully she will before she—

29:06.700 --> 29:08.810
Excuse me, Denny.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.510
–Jerry?
–Alan.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.334
What are you doing?

29:21.370 --> 29:23.980
I'm standing with my
head up against a wall.

29:24.020 --> 29:25.750
Yes.

29:27.740 --> 29:28.990
Why?

29:29.070 --> 29:31.310
I had a little row with Leigh.

29:31.390 --> 29:33.220
I saw that.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.750
Much of the office did.

29:35.850 --> 29:37.460
I think I was mean to her.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.450
Was I mean to her?

29:38.490 --> 29:41.750
Well, from my vantage
point, you were very mean.

29:41.850 --> 29:44.930
She was feeling
hurt, extremely vulnerable.

29:44.990 --> 29:49.360
She lashed out in pain, at which point
you whipped out the wooden cigarette
and thrashed her with it.

29:49.400 --> 29:52.480
I just felt everyone staring at us and…

29:52.570 --> 29:54.650
Have you called her to apologize?

29:54.690 --> 29:56.880
Tried, but…

29:58.760 --> 30:02.420
She's dating my clock radio,
just to get back at me.

30:02.490 --> 30:03.700
Uh, I beg your pardon?

30:03.740 --> 30:05.530
She has a crush on my clock radio.

30:05.570 --> 30:09.140
I let her borrow it after
the utility box was killed,

30:09.380 --> 30:14.330
and when I called to apologize, the
two of them were headed out to a movie.

30:15.410 --> 30:18.190
I'm not quite sure
how to respond to that,

30:18.250 --> 30:23.320
other than to say, you've had two
wonderful dates with this woman.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.620
Uh, you're at the precipice of kissing.

30:25.660 --> 30:27.690
And it just seems…

30:27.740 --> 30:31.950
wrong for her now to be
dating your clock radio.

30:34.060 --> 30:38.860
Policemen do tough work, dangerous
work in cities across this country

30:38.940 --> 30:42.470
that seem to only grow
more and more dangerous.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.630
That is a reality.

30:45.870 --> 30:48.480
But here is another reality:

30:48.830 --> 30:56.270
african-americans have been targeted
disproportionately in both arrests
and excessive force.

30:56.350 --> 31:03.870
Blacks comprise 13% of our population,
yet 44% of our prison population.

31:03.950 --> 31:07.030
And how many times do you have to turn on
the news and see that yet another innocent,

31:07.070 --> 31:13.050
unarmed black man has been shot dead
by the police before we say “enough?”

31:13.110 --> 31:16.030
Eight times, he shot him.

31:16.130 --> 31:22.210
Even his partner, who is also his
friend, called the shooting “reckless.”

31:22.310 --> 31:24.460
Was it an honest mistake?

31:24.560 --> 31:29.510
Yeah, sure, like the last time he
mistakenly shot an unarmed black man.

31:29.590 --> 31:32.310
How many mistakes…

31:32.390 --> 31:34.700
can we allow him?

31:34.780 --> 31:40.030
Do we keep tolerating
these executions or not?

31:40.110 --> 31:44.560
The victim matched the
description of the armed suspect.

31:44.640 --> 31:46.820
He raised his hand with
something metallic in it.

31:46.860 --> 31:50.280
It looked like a gun.
My client reacted.

31:50.310 --> 31:56.430
The district attorney did not offer
even one witness to dispute that.

31:56.520 --> 32:00.230
Instead, he gave you a brain scan.

32:00.320 --> 32:04.580
The police can now take our
blood, our hair, our DNA.

32:04.650 --> 32:07.970
They can make us give handwriting
samples, voice patterns.

32:08.010 --> 32:13.750
They can check our computers to see what
interests us, our GPSes to see where we've been.

32:13.790 --> 32:19.710
And today, they're introducing
scans to show our feelings.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.640
Where does it stop?

32:21.740 --> 32:27.600
And let's assume these MRIs really
can show that my client feared
black people more than whites.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.320
So what?

32:29.410 --> 32:34.520
The law has to distinguish
between thought and deed.

32:34.600 --> 32:38.490
The supreme court is
doing away with warrants.

32:38.570 --> 32:41.360
Our administration
eavesdrops on all of us.

32:41.400 --> 32:46.620
Are we really going to allow this
government to unleash the thought police?

32:46.700 --> 32:49.580
Are we that scared?

32:52.030 --> 32:53.920
We must be.

32:54.000 --> 33:03.740
Because today, the prosecution is
trying to convict a man of murder
with nothing more than an MRI.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.980
God help us.

33:33.390 --> 33:35.980
It can't even keep proper time.

33:36.060 --> 33:37.570
You even have a dishonest clock.

33:37.610 --> 33:41.834
Hey, I'd really love to chat, but
I'm running late for the moon.

33:42.850 --> 33:44.410
I'm sorry, Leigh.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.370
I didn't mean what I said before.

33:46.410 --> 33:49.000
I'd love to keep seeing you.

33:49.100 --> 33:51.320
Just not in this lifetime.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.050
I'm too odd, Jerry. I get it.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.390
You're not too odd.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.860
It's… the reason…

33:55.880 --> 34:01.190
it's just, our two dates
went so well, I…

34:01.290 --> 34:04.490
was afraid of the third date.

34:04.570 --> 34:05.450
Why?

34:05.560 --> 34:09.280
Because I was worried
I'd be expected…

34:09.380 --> 34:10.469
to kiss you.

34:10.550 --> 34:16.027
Which I'd like to do, but it's all so
terrifying, your being a real person and all.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.710
There.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.100
Can we move on?

34:26.179 --> 34:28.940
It went by so fast.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.639
Jerry, I'm just as scared.

34:33.750 --> 34:35.880
Forget about kissing.

34:35.980 --> 34:40.467
Have you thought about how hard
it will be for the two of us to hug?

34:44.190 --> 34:45.940
All right.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.489
All right.

34:48.730 --> 34:54.389
First off, I will have no comment
about my modified headgear.

34:56.600 --> 35:01.250
Truth is always a complete
defense against defamation.

35:01.330 --> 35:02.800
Well, that's the law.

35:02.900 --> 35:07.260
But I am mindful that 30-second video
blogs… without the proper context…

35:07.300 --> 35:10.200
do not always capture the truth.

35:10.280 --> 35:13.540
I'm also mindful that we live in
a video world now, where every Tom,

35:13.580 --> 35:20.800
Dick and Harry with a cell phone
is a de facto cameraman and
via the internet, a-a distributor.

35:20.880 --> 35:25.210
Maybe the current tort
laws do need adjusting.

35:25.300 --> 35:34.400
But right now, as they are written,
they offer no remedy to those
who may be humiliated by this.

35:34.520 --> 35:39.110
The case is therefore dismissed.

35:39.310 --> 35:44.740
As a footnote, if anybody in this
room did take footage, moving or still,

35:44.820 --> 35:53.530
of me in my headgear, you are hereby
enjoined from posting it anywhere.

35:55.450 --> 35:58.440
We are adjourned.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.410
I'm okay.

36:11.120 --> 36:12.640
Sorry, Clarence. We tried.

36:12.680 --> 36:14.510
Yes, thank you.

36:14.630 --> 36:22.500
I think the best advice for all of us
to remember is if you're out in public,
assume the cameras are watching.

36:28.420 --> 36:31.410
Okay, then, I'm told we
have a unanimous verdict.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.930
The defense will please rise.

36:34.590 --> 36:37.410
Madam foreperson, what say you?

36:37.650 --> 36:43.630
“in the matter of the Commonwealth
vs Jeffrey Bass, on the charge of
murder in the second degree,

36:43.670 --> 36:47.620
we find the defendant
Jeffrey Bass not guilty.”

36:47.730 --> 36:49.040
No.

36:49.100 --> 36:52.760
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank
you for your service. You're dismissed.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.790
We're adjourned.

36:55.510 --> 36:57.210
Thank you.

36:57.310 --> 36:59.120
Thank you so much.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.540
Get a job without a gun, Mr Bass.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.610
All right, I've made my ruling.

37:07.650 --> 37:08.880
What? No.

37:08.890 --> 37:10.400
You said you'd hear from me.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.370
Yeah, I could predict
what you'd say.

37:12.410 --> 37:14.750
Well, I'd like to say it
just the same, your honor.

37:14.790 --> 37:16.300
Whatever.

37:16.620 --> 37:21.610
Your honor, uh, what Denny Crane
did and said here was offensive.

37:21.690 --> 37:22.960
It was cruel.

37:23.100 --> 37:26.030
I'd go so far as to say indecent.

37:26.120 --> 37:30.020
But every plaintiff has a
duty to mitigate damages,

37:30.100 --> 37:33.680
and this woman was offered
her job back within an hour.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.470
That couldn't make her
whole from the pain.

37:35.510 --> 37:36.320
May I finish?

37:36.360 --> 37:38.010
–I hereby rule that—
–No!

37:39.010 --> 37:43.430
Your honor, I agree w-with m-many
of the things Ms Path said.

37:43.440 --> 37:46.930
Fat people are discriminated
against, unfairly and pervasively.

37:46.970 --> 37:51.800
It is unforgivable to judge somebody
on physical appearance alone,
especially in the workplace.

37:51.840 --> 37:57.950
But what my client did here
was not altogether wrong.

37:58.070 --> 38:04.970
In fact, more employers should
draw a harder line on obesity.

38:05.050 --> 38:05.970
Oh, really?

38:06.080 --> 38:08.510
Yes, because it doesn't
just go to looks.

38:08.550 --> 38:12.576
This goes to a serious health issue.
–A serious health issue.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.780
And frankly, it's inexcusable.

38:14.850 --> 38:18.160
65% of american adults are obese.

38:18.260 --> 38:20.960
It's one of the leading causes
of death in this country.

38:21.000 --> 38:25.200
The health care costs run
about $117 billion a year.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.760
And we just keep eating
and eating and eating.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.350
Look at me. Look at—

38:30.400 --> 38:31.520
Denny.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.010
The fast food companies
keep proliferating,

38:34.050 --> 38:36.160
portion sizes keep
getting bigger and bigger,

38:36.200 --> 38:38.200
candy bars and soft drinks…

38:38.300 --> 38:43.190
and we keep getting fatter and fatter and
fatter as if it's not killing us, and it is.

38:43.230 --> 38:49.990
And given this new study at Harvard,
maybe what Denny did, uh,
wasn't altogether out of line.

38:50.070 --> 38:54.360
Simply having fat friends can
triple your risk of becoming obese.

38:54.460 --> 38:58.380
If this is true, judge, if obesity is
contagious through social networking,

38:58.420 --> 39:03.930
then maybe all employers have a duty to
their employees to weed out the heifers.

39:04.040 --> 39:08.680
And maybe it's about time, uh,
to put aside our inflated sense

39:08.760 --> 39:12.770
of political correctness and practice a
little tough love with our friends and family.

39:12.810 --> 39:15.320
Say to a loved one,“you're fat.”

39:15.430 --> 39:19.230
Tell a friend,“you look like a hippo
on the verge of a heart attack.”

39:19.270 --> 39:22.640
Shock them into going on diets,
not just to save themselves,

39:22.680 --> 39:24.560
but possibly their
friends and coworkers.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.510
That's all Denny Crane
was trying to say.

39:26.550 --> 39:29.890
And perhaps he should
be applauded for it.

39:38.600 --> 39:39.510
You done?

39:39.610 --> 39:42.610
Yes, your honor, it
appears I'm quite done.

39:43.650 --> 39:46.990
Case dismissed. Adjourned.

39:49.630 --> 39:51.790
We won?

39:52.770 --> 39:54.860
We won.

40:06.210 --> 40:09.590
I still can't believe
she ruled in our favor.

40:09.830 --> 40:11.910
Because you judged her by
her appearance, that's why.

40:11.950 --> 40:14.060
So did you.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.310
Maybe a little.

40:17.480 --> 40:21.836
You know, Denny, since I've been
your friend, I've gotten heavier.

40:22.410 --> 40:24.020
You're blaming me?

40:24.120 --> 40:25.830
Well, that study…

40:25.910 --> 40:27.920
Since I've met you,
I've gotten bigger.

40:27.960 --> 40:28.700
You're the feed bag.

40:28.740 --> 40:30.220
Me?

40:30.330 --> 40:31.090
You're the influence.

40:31.130 --> 40:33.290
Oh, come on.

40:33.370 --> 40:35.240
I don't believe that study anyway.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.810
You don't?

40:36.810 --> 40:37.710
Think about it.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.430
Of course fat people
have fat friends.

40:39.470 --> 40:43.670
Thin people don't want to hang
around with them. They're too fat.

40:43.710 --> 40:45.520
What?

40:47.150 --> 40:49.660
You doing okay?

40:49.790 --> 40:50.610
I don't know what
you're talking about.

40:50.650 --> 40:52.470
Of course you do.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.640
Here's my philosophy on women, Alan.

40:54.680 --> 40:55.320
Oh, God.

40:55.420 --> 40:59.410
It's better to want something you don't
have than have something you don't want.

40:59.450 --> 41:02.670
Now when it comes to you
and Lorraine…

41:02.900 --> 41:04.110
I can't have her.

41:04.190 --> 41:06.810
Exactly.

41:10.770 --> 41:13.430
Sleepover tonight?

41:13.450 --> 41:14.470
No popcorn.

41:14.530 --> 41:15.322
Oh, come on…

41:15.400 --> 41:17.310
See? Bad influence.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.110
Well, how can you watch
a movie without popcorn?

41:19.150 --> 41:20.660
Did you not listen
to my closing, Denny?

41:20.700 --> 41:22.380
I never listen.

41:22.460 --> 41:24.360
Was it good?
–It was good.

41:24.370 --> 41:27.080
–So stop sulking.
–I'm not sulking.

41:27.160 --> 41:31.370
Well, don't even come over
if you're gonna be like that.

41:31.990 --> 41:32.970
Maybe I won't then.

41:33.010 --> 41:34.440
–Fine.
–Fine.

41:37.330 --> 41:38.950
9:00?

41:39.070 --> 41:41.170
No red vines.
