<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:04.046 --> 00:05.127
The Flash is back!

00:05.506 --> 00:06.622
<i>How did you get your powers?</i>

00:06.757 --> 00:07.793
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>

00:07.925 --> 00:09.132
And do you too wanna know
the best part?

00:09.635 --> 00:10.876
I wasn't the only one.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.253
- Iris West, will you marry me?
- Yes.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.012
- This isn't goodbye.
- No.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.134
<i>Will I see you later?</i>

00:17.351 --> 00:19.638
He's right where you wanted him.
What do we do now?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.761
We find the others.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.363
Begin recording.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.442
Observations on subject number two.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.823
Name, Rebecca Sharpe,

00:37.913 --> 00:39.404
<i>or as she prefers...</i>

00:39.581 --> 00:42.119
<i>- The plebeian sobriquet Becky.
- Hey, I'm Becky.</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:45.998
It's Becky with a "Y,"
not an "I-E" or an "E-E."

00:46.088 --> 00:49.172
Just "Y." And you heard me
say no milk, right?

00:49.299 --> 00:52.667
'Cause I am
severely lactose intolerant, like...

00:52.970 --> 00:55.678
Subject was born in Sarasota, Florida.

00:56.306 --> 01:00.300
<i>The first indignity in a life
full of unfortunate circumstances.</i>

01:07.818 --> 01:09.980
That is definitely not soy.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.522
Subject lives with her boyfriend.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.572
Almost there, almost there,
almost there!

01:17.286 --> 01:18.322
Kenny!

01:20.664 --> 01:25.784
We are going to deal with this
in five to 10 minutes!

01:26.753 --> 01:28.039
<i>Correction.</i>

01:28.422 --> 01:31.335
Subject previously lived
with her boyfriend.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.460
<i>Subject's occupation,
blackjack dealer.</i>

01:36.430 --> 01:38.638
Or should I hit?

01:38.849 --> 01:40.090
Subject's temperament.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.926
I don't know, man, I think
you should just hit. Why don't you hit?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.010
Defeatist.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.475
- Okay, I'll hit.
- Great. Perfect.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.352
- And...
- Twenty-one!

01:48.442 --> 01:50.479
It is here.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.105
Oh, wow.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.480
- Here you go, sir, congratulations.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

01:55.574 --> 01:56.655
- Here you go.
- Sure.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.280
Oh, that's nice, thank you.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.868
- Looks like I found my good luck charm.
- Hey!

02:03.832 --> 02:04.822
My appletini!

02:05.167 --> 02:06.703
Oh, no, oh, no.

02:07.044 --> 02:10.162
Can I maybe just get
a reference, you think?

02:10.255 --> 02:11.416
No?

02:11.506 --> 02:13.543
Subject believes
no matter what she does,

02:13.634 --> 02:15.751
the universe will conspire
to punish her.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.298
Another job... Ow!

02:18.555 --> 02:21.468
<i>Or as she writes
on her Myspace page,</i>

02:21.600 --> 02:22.761
"I am jinxed."

02:29.733 --> 02:32.225
Great! There goes another car!

02:36.198 --> 02:37.359
It's okay, I'm fine.

02:37.699 --> 02:42.569
Subject's low self-esteem suggests
she will be easily manipulated.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.825
Wait! Wait!

02:44.956 --> 02:45.946
Ow!

02:48.960 --> 02:50.121
Wait! Wait! Wait!

02:51.630 --> 02:53.462
Come on! I'm here!

02:53.632 --> 02:57.091
Hey! Yes, thank you, universe!

02:57.177 --> 02:59.920
Finally, some good luck! Hi!

03:00.055 --> 03:01.421
Okay.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.465
Barry!

03:47.936 --> 03:49.222
- Where are you?
<i>- I don't know!</i>

03:49.604 --> 03:51.436
I lost Caitlin.
There's too many of them, man.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.685
No, you can take them.
Just listen to me.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.770
You just need to do one thing.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.186
Run, Barry. Run!

04:05.120 --> 04:06.110
Come on!

04:07.873 --> 04:08.863
They got me.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.536
You have failed this city.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.084
For real, Chad? In the back?

04:21.553 --> 04:22.634
Suck it, old man.

04:22.888 --> 04:23.878
Oh...

04:25.474 --> 04:26.965
Wait, did you guys die already?

04:27.058 --> 04:30.301
- Well, Chad...
- He just told us...

04:31.354 --> 04:32.470
Come on. Come on.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.684
I don't know what's wrong with kids
these days. You're churlish.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.317
You better watch yourself, Chad.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.564
Come at me at the paintball field
next time, I'll kick your little a...

04:43.825 --> 04:45.407
<i>Mrs. McConell, how are you doing?</i>

04:45.577 --> 04:47.569
Chad's a treasure, he really is.

04:47.662 --> 04:48.823
Pretzel for Caitlin...

04:49.039 --> 04:51.281
Corndog for Iris.
Two franks for Cisco.

04:51.374 --> 04:52.364
Yes, thank you.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.335
Three burgers, five churros
and six funnel cakes for Barry.

04:55.504 --> 04:59.123
Look at all of this junk.
Guys, I'm really sorry.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.841
If the pipes in the house weren't
making this weird, annoying sound,

05:02.928 --> 05:04.920
I would have just actually
had you all over for dinner.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.130
Squeaky pipes at the West house,
what a surprise.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.678
Really? You're familiar with this sound?

05:09.893 --> 05:11.634
Oh, yeah, you mean the...

05:14.564 --> 05:17.932
- Yeah.
- It's been doing that for 18 years?

05:18.026 --> 05:21.235
Every house has a personality,
ours just likes to be heard.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.824
Oh, my gosh, they broke up.
The Wexler-Waclawiks broke up.

05:26.910 --> 05:27.900
- For real?
- Yes.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.201
- Hell, yeah!
- Yes!

05:29.329 --> 05:31.616
Who are the Wexler-Wa-claws-wilix,

05:31.706 --> 05:33.413
and why are we happy
that their love is dead?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.287
They are a couple that were
getting married at the Propizio

05:35.377 --> 05:38.165
the weekend of the second,
which means now the venue is open.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.621
That's amazing. What good luck.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.956
Yeah, so, now, we just
have to put a deposit down.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.837
- I'll run it over.
- No, already covered, babe.

05:43.927 --> 05:44.917
Oh.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.175
Oh, God. Breach alert, guys.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.522
Uh...

06:04.865 --> 06:07.198
Hey, Harry. Um, is Jesse not coming?

06:09.119 --> 06:10.610
So, um...

06:10.787 --> 06:12.574
I thought Jesse and I
were having date night.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.577
Yeah, that's what you thought.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.075
<i>Let me just...</i>

06:18.628 --> 06:19.994
Okay.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.883
Let's... Just let me...

06:31.766 --> 06:34.179
- Okay, so...
<i>- Ahem. Hey, Wally, it's me.</i>

06:34.394 --> 06:35.601
Good to see you.

06:35.812 --> 06:39.180
<i>So, I've been doing
some thinking, and...</i>

06:39.941 --> 06:43.355
<i>You know, we've both been so busy...</i>

06:46.197 --> 06:49.281
Stupid hologram,
it's the darn Atlantean plastic.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.784
It's really shoddy workmanship.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.577
- Sorry about this.
- What is this thing?

06:58.460 --> 06:59.450
Break... Breakup cube.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.333
You don't have breakup cubes
on your Earth?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.466
It's not good. Okay, okay.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.341
A breakup cube is, uh...

07:13.308 --> 07:15.140
Kind of what it sounds like.
You know,

07:15.226 --> 07:18.094
you record a message
for the person you wanna...

07:18.480 --> 07:20.938
The person,
and you pick a music setting,

07:21.024 --> 07:23.732
and then there's...
A tissue pops out, if you need that.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.854
You know, a breakup cube.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.938
Jesse's breaking up with me
with a cube?

07:30.659 --> 07:32.901
Seems like a really convenient way
to break somebody's heart.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.443
Exactly.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.362
What did she say in the message?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.580
Well, you know, you heard.
"You're a great guy,"

07:38.667 --> 07:39.908
I don't remember.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.498
- Don't you have total recall?
- Yeah. No, no.

07:43.588 --> 07:47.002
Don't. I did, I don't.
I did, but I don't.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.626
Come on, don't make me...

07:51.137 --> 07:53.845
She... You heard. She said that
you are a great, great guy,

07:53.932 --> 07:56.766
and that she was busy on our Earth
and that you're busy here,

07:56.851 --> 07:58.308
filling in for, you know...

07:59.521 --> 08:02.730
On this Earth. And she just felt that
you guys were a little out of sync.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.974
You know? And that she needed some time

08:05.068 --> 08:08.357
to work on her stuff, you know?
"It's not you, it's me."

08:08.446 --> 08:11.359
Not me. "Her" me. Her.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.575
Not me, her. And she said, you know,

08:14.661 --> 08:19.201
"I'll never forget you, Wally West,
because you're amazing," and then...

08:19.332 --> 08:22.370
That you were her first.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.667
And a bunch of other stuff,
not important.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.673
So, the heeds talk,
you don't need that, right?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.842
You're a tough guy, right, West?

08:32.386 --> 08:33.594
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.921
Yeah. Um...

08:42.188 --> 08:44.305
Doesn't want a cube. I don't blame him.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.769
211s at First National
and O'Sullivan Bank.

08:49.946 --> 08:50.982
Could be a spree.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.110
The Central City Bank's on
that avenue, too. I'll check it out.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.120
- We're not done.
- What?

09:05.503 --> 09:09.042
I'm sorry, I don't know why the app
crashed, but this one's on the house.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.670
Oh.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.842
Find a penny, pick it up,
then all day, you'll have good luck.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.513
So true.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.803
Good afternoon, ma'am.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.265
It is a good afternoon,
Mr. Security Man.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.873
Please, don't touch the oven, Mom.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.394
Aw... You waited for me!

10:10.193 --> 10:11.183
I see her.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.313
She's getting away in a Prius.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.112
Last time I checked,
the Flash is faster than a Prius.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.866
Oh!

10:29.420 --> 10:30.877
What the hell?

10:38.513 --> 10:41.005
That's the least secure
security footage I've ever seen.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.261
Yeah, that's not even
the strangest thing she made happen.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.559
I mean,
I slipped on a barrel of marbles.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.977
It was like I was in a cartoon.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.304
That's some seriously bad luck.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.063
Yeah, no such thing as luck.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.982
Yeah? Tell that to my cousin, Hector.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.734
He got jinxed by an ex,

10:53.862 --> 10:56.445
hasn't been able to find
a mall parking spot for three years.

10:56.531 --> 11:00.775
Hey, so, we ran the sketches you made
us through the CCPD database, and...

11:00.952 --> 11:03.786
Her name's Becky Sharpe,
she's 24 years old.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.329
- No priors.
- No priors?

11:05.415 --> 11:06.747
Then why is she in the database?

11:06.875 --> 11:09.083
Because in the last three years
she has lived in Central City,

11:09.169 --> 11:12.207
she's been rear-ended four times,
her identity stolen twice.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.789
A cat burglar literally burgled her cat.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.750
Okay, you see, Harry,
that is bad juju.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.003
Okay, Ramon, what you call juju,

11:21.097 --> 11:22.759
I call quantum entanglement.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.177
<i>Discrete quantum particles</i>

11:24.267 --> 11:26.759
are connected and when triggered,
they simulate a synchronicity

11:26.853 --> 11:30.767
that to the untrained eye, to the
common eye, could seem like luck.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.400
So, if Becky can affect the particles
around her in a positive way,

11:34.485 --> 11:36.727
then their connected particles
start spinning negatively.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.526
So, when good things happen to her,
bad things happen all around her.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.448
Great, she's got a good luck field.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.486
- She's a meta.
- Well, except, she can't be,

11:44.579 --> 11:46.445
I mean, she's only been in
Central City for three years.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.662
Yeah, so,
there's no way she was affected

11:47.749 --> 11:49.115
by the particle accelerator explosion.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.833
Well, neither was Kilg%re.
We saw firsthand what he could do.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.373
Not to sound like a broken record,

11:53.463 --> 11:55.580
but where the hell are
all these new metas coming from?

11:55.882 --> 11:58.249
You know what, maybe the scanners
in the suit picked something up.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.004
You said you took all the tech out.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.552
Okay, well, I left something in.
Okay? Sue me.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.172
Cecile needs me at the house.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.632
You guys let me know
what you find out, all right?

12:06.726 --> 12:07.716
All right.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.769
- There.
- Yeah, I see it, okay.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.973
The suit definitely registered trace
amounts of dark matter on Becky.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.603
So, if there was another
dark matter incident...

12:15.693 --> 12:18.356
We need to figure out how and where
it happened, ASAP.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.405
I'll calibrate your satellite to scan
for the same dark matter in the suit.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.948
- No, you won't.
<i>- Yeah, I will.</i>

12:23.034 --> 12:26.152
- Don't touch the satellite. Don't...
<i>- I'll be touching it.</i>

12:27.455 --> 12:30.414
Oh, something just arrived for me
at the loft. I gotta go.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.038
What?

12:36.214 --> 12:37.330
<i>You called the plumber?</i>

12:37.507 --> 12:40.250
Joe West, I cannot keep
living with that sound.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.923
You know, this house is, uh...

12:43.096 --> 12:46.134
- Bitchin'?
- No. It's in need of some work.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.433
In my certified opinion,
you need all new piping.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.603
It'll set you back $15 thou.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.180
Mmm.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.142
Okay. Thank you so much.

12:58.444 --> 13:03.235
You've given us a lot to think about.
And I mean a whole lot.

13:07.245 --> 13:08.656
Fifteen thousand.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.580
My great uncle paid less
for this whole place.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.582
I guess I'm gonna have to break open
the piggy bank.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.796
Or, you know,
we could take that fifteen,

13:18.881 --> 13:21.214
we could put it towards
a down payment on something new.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.043
Ooh...

13:25.054 --> 13:28.218
You're suggesting that
we sell my house?

13:28.308 --> 13:30.550
Babe, I'm just saying,
you know, this is...

13:30.727 --> 13:33.720
This is a really big place for
a couple of empty nesters like us,

13:33.813 --> 13:36.897
and there's always gonna be something
that's gonna need replacing.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.148
Let me think about it, okay?

13:40.695 --> 13:44.063
- Think about it.
- Think about it.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.947
- I'll think about it.
- Think about it.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.623
Barry! Oh, my God, turn around!

13:58.713 --> 13:59.794
- I did.
- Did you see?

13:59.881 --> 14:01.088
- No, I didn't see!
- You saw!

14:01.174 --> 14:03.757
I did see, but just for a second.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.176
Which is like an eternity
for a speedster.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.929
You know it's bad luck to see a bride
in her dress before the wedding day.

14:09.307 --> 14:10.423
Too late.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.969
- What happened?
- The Propizio called.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.063
We're not gonna be able to
have our wedding there.

14:18.608 --> 14:19.598
What? Why?

14:20.234 --> 14:22.191
Well, the villa burned down,

14:22.278 --> 14:25.396
I guess a crème brûlée competition
got a little heated.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.651
Okay, well, thankfully,
we have our backup.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.488
No, another couple booked it
this morning.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.783
It's okay, though, it's okay.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.711
If we can stop evil,
time-traveling speedsters

14:40.797 --> 14:43.039
from destroying the planet,
we can find a wedding venue.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.919
Barry, our wedding is in six weeks!

14:45.009 --> 14:46.966
It'll work out, okay?

14:47.804 --> 14:50.296
I would marry you anytime, anywhere.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.315
Kobe beef, my favorite.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.653
Becky! What are the chances
I'd run into you?

15:06.739 --> 15:08.981
Is this your secretary?

15:09.367 --> 15:11.233
Funny, you said she was haggard.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.444
- No, I never said that.
- Let me get that for you.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.702
I don't understand.
Your plan revolves around this dolt?

15:22.046 --> 15:24.254
<i>Who makes soup so hot?</i>

15:25.591 --> 15:29.426
As lusterless as Rebecca is, she may
be the most formidable of them all.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.378
Then why don't we get her now?

15:31.556 --> 15:34.674
The capricious nature of her powers
warrants further observation.

15:39.981 --> 15:43.065
<i>Oh, man, are those live lobsters?</i>

15:45.820 --> 15:47.231
- Gimme that.
- Stop hovering, okay?

15:47.321 --> 15:49.062
- You're not holding it...
- I know how to read a dark matter...

15:49.157 --> 15:51.194
- Not from where I see, you don't.
- Oh, yeah, good one.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.365
Don't you have
somewhere else to be? Like,

15:52.452 --> 15:53.863
maybe breaking
another speedster's heart?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.660
- Have one...
- Sorry I'm late.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.409
Iris and I just lost two wedding
venues in less than 24 hours.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.991
- Bad juju.
- Gimme that, okay?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.001
It's more of a test. All right.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.919
Here we go and adjust...

16:07.425 --> 16:08.791
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.376
Here. Right here.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.844
This was where Becky Sharpe
was exposed to dark matter.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.301
- Here?
- Yes.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.848
It can't be,
this is the middle of the street.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.470
- It's not even an intersection.
- My scans are accurate.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.893
- My scans are accurate.
- Accurate?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.686
Explain how there's nothing
within miles of here

16:21.772 --> 16:23.809
capable of even creating dark matter.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.436
There was three weeks ago.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.065
<i>This is where I came out
of the Speed Force.</i>

16:31.782 --> 16:33.364
No, it isn't.
You came out in Ivy City.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.660
No, I ran there after. I remember
now, this is where I came out.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.033
This is where the portal opened.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.291
And a wave of dark matter
washed out with you.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.493
I can only imagine
how many meta-humans you created.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.291
My best guess...

16:52.553 --> 16:53.543
A busload.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.729
We did it? We brought dark matter
into Central City?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.730
When you pulled me out
of the Speed Force, yeah.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.612
All the people on that bus,
we turned them into metas.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.987
Every time we try to do something
right, it goes horribly wrong.

17:16.077 --> 17:17.067
We're cursed.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.239
Maybe we should burn some sage.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.411
Guys, we're not cursed.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.789
You're not cursed.
You should be cursed at.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.621
Okay, why should we be "cursed at"?

17:24.710 --> 17:26.952
You should be cursed at
because you opened the Speed Force

17:27.046 --> 17:28.502
- without consulting me.
- Okay, I don't think we need to...

17:29.757 --> 17:30.747
All right.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.457
Okay, I did consult you,
and you were the one

17:32.552 --> 17:33.759
who gave me the calculations
in the first place.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.460
I told you not to use them
without consulting me.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.217
I said, Ramon,
don't use the calculations

17:37.306 --> 17:38.763
- without consulting me!
- Guys!

17:38.933 --> 17:40.265
I heard you,
I didn't see the need for that.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.259
<i>And that's why
you should be cursed at.</i>

17:42.353 --> 17:44.436
- What does that even mean?
- What does that mean? It means...

17:44.522 --> 17:46.684
Okay, you know what, this is
exactly why we didn't contact you.

17:46.774 --> 17:47.855
'Cause the last thing
we need around here

17:47.942 --> 17:49.774
is more of your salty-ass attitude!

17:49.860 --> 17:52.318
If you don't need my salty attitude,
maybe you should carry on without me.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.317
- I'll let myself out.
- You're going back to your Earth?

17:54.407 --> 17:56.239
- I'll breach you there right now.
- "I'll breach you there right now!"

17:56.534 --> 17:58.400
That's not what I sound like.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.285
That was really high.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.658
Listen, Cisco,
I know Harry could stand to work

18:02.748 --> 18:05.365
- on his bedside manner, but...
- You know what, we don't need him.

18:05.543 --> 18:08.627
What we need is to focus
on catching this meta, am I right?

18:08.713 --> 18:09.703
Yeah, you're right.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.629
But Becky doesn't seem like
one of our typical villains.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.880
I think if we could track her down,
maybe we could get through to her.

18:15.886 --> 18:16.967
Hey, Cecile.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.296
What?

18:19.682 --> 18:20.672
I'm on my way.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.717
I need you to run me to the house.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.144
- You said you...
- I need you to run me to the house.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.304
Yes, sir.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.932
Ah...

18:31.152 --> 18:32.893
What happened?

18:34.113 --> 18:38.699
The ceiling went
from clanking to howling, and then

18:38.826 --> 18:41.910
it just started pouring
all of this stuff down.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.989
- We need to turn the water off, stat.
- Yeah.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.956
So, the water valve
is in the crawl space. Um...

18:50.713 --> 18:52.204
Don't ever go into the crawl space.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.124
I hear you, loud and clear.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.502
Barry, thank you very much
for your help.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.424
I'm gonna go check upstairs.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.216
Man, why is this happening?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.351
- Did that girl jinx us?
- No.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.600
No. Nobody jinxed us.
This house is just...

19:10.524 --> 19:12.231
- What's another word for old?
- Vintage.

19:12.777 --> 19:15.019
- Vintage.
- Cecile thinks I should sell it.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.989
Yeah, what do you think?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.449
I think she's got a point.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.283
Life would be a hell of a lot easier
in a brand-new house.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.826
Sounds like an easy decision.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.033
It should be, but...

19:31.253 --> 19:34.621
This house has got one thing
no other house will ever have.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.963
Remember I measured you kids
every birthday?

19:39.053 --> 19:42.888
Yeah, I outgrew Iris at 12.
She kept saying she'd catch up.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.181
All of my memories of you kids
are tied into these walls.

19:49.897 --> 19:53.186
- How can I give that up?
- You don't have to give that up, Joe.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.309
You'll always have those memories
no matter where you live.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.398
<i>Trust me.</i>

19:57.988 --> 20:01.277
When I came to live here
after my mom died, I learned that

20:01.492 --> 20:03.324
it doesn't matter where you live.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.447
It only matters
that you have people that love you.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.286
Hold on. What's up?

20:11.085 --> 20:14.203
Great. Okay. I'll go there now.
Thank you.

20:14.296 --> 20:17.084
We're not jinxed. If we were,
Cisco wouldn't have found Becky.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.291
She's at Jitters, I'm going there now.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.013
Winner, winner.
Another winner.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.224
Becky? Hi, do you mind if I sit here?

20:33.691 --> 20:37.150
Oh, today's my lucky day,
but you're not my type at all.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.309
Can I sit?

20:38.404 --> 20:39.645
Um...

20:39.739 --> 20:42.948
Becky, you're probably wondering
how I know your name.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.201
Mmm... It's written on my cup.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.954
Right. Um...

20:50.082 --> 20:54.326
But that's not how I... You see,
I work for the CCPD as a CSI.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.546
I investigate very special people.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.839
Celebrities?

21:00.468 --> 21:05.680
No, not celebrities. Meta-humans,
which is what I think you are.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.307
See, I think
you were exposed to dark matter

21:10.519 --> 21:12.135
on a city bus three weeks ago.

21:13.397 --> 21:18.768
I think I would know if I was
exposed to dark matter. That's weird.

21:20.279 --> 21:25.365
Becky, I know, you've been having
a lot of luck lately.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.318
And that you took some money
from the Central City Bank

21:28.412 --> 21:29.778
that doesn't belong to you.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.455
- How do you know all that?
- I just do.

21:33.459 --> 21:36.167
Look, getting powers is overwhelming.

21:36.587 --> 21:39.955
I'm sure you don't know how they work
or what you should do with them.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.710
I have some idea.

21:43.719 --> 21:44.709
Uh-uh-uh.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.011
Do you really wanna test your luck?

21:47.431 --> 21:50.219
Bad things happen to people
that get in my way.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.900
Listen, CSI guy.

22:02.822 --> 22:07.942
My entire life has been one piece
of crummy luck after the next.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.902
Look, we all have ups and downs in life.

22:11.038 --> 22:16.329
No, not Becky Sharpe.
I have only ever been dealt bad hands.

22:17.086 --> 22:21.251
But I knew one day, the universe
would see it made a mistake.

22:21.882 --> 22:25.091
And then I'd have the run of the table.

22:25.845 --> 22:30.715
I got on that bus and Lady Luck
smiled on me.

22:31.350 --> 22:35.310
Becky, this isn't some higher power
fixing a miscalculation.

22:35.396 --> 22:39.106
You have powers and they're affecting
everyone around you,

22:39.441 --> 22:41.649
making them feel as awful
as you used to feel.

22:43.237 --> 22:47.698
I'm sorry about that.
But maybe it's just their turn.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.944
Maybe for once, everyone else
can feel for a second,

22:52.037 --> 22:53.869
how bad I felt my entire life.

22:54.999 --> 22:59.460
Anyway, there is nothing you can do

23:00.170 --> 23:01.411
to stop me.

23:11.682 --> 23:12.672
<i>Toodles.</i>

23:24.028 --> 23:25.269
<i>So, what are we gonna do?</i>

23:25.779 --> 23:28.021
I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure yet.

23:28.157 --> 23:30.524
I can't get close enough to her
without triggering bad luck.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.325
Seriously, that girl's a hazard.

23:32.828 --> 23:36.367
Hazard. That's the one.
Maybe that means the jinx is gone.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.832
Her powers only work
in her immediate vicinity.

23:39.919 --> 23:40.909
She didn't jinx us.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.537
And the house
is still falling to pieces.

23:43.714 --> 23:47.833
It's been falling apart for years,
just like, really slowly.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.546
Plus, Jesse dumped me, too.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.678
I know, dude. And, you know, that sucks.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.927
And we're up against a meta
we can't even touch,

23:55.017 --> 23:56.758
and we're the ones
who made her in the first place.

23:56.852 --> 24:00.095
Guys, do you have any idea
how ridiculous you all sound?

24:00.189 --> 24:02.806
We have not been jinxed,
or cursed, all right?

24:03.025 --> 24:05.517
We make our own luck, right?

24:06.070 --> 24:08.403
So, what do you say we focus,
and we figure this out?

24:10.532 --> 24:13.616
Hey, Iris, you're where?

24:21.043 --> 24:22.955
- Oh, come on. Hey.
- Hey.

24:23.337 --> 24:26.296
Why did you want me to put on a shirt
and meet you at a funeral?

24:26.382 --> 24:28.248
No, no, I wanted you
to meet me at this church.

24:28.342 --> 24:29.458
- What?
- We're getting married.

24:29.551 --> 24:30.792
Here, put this on.

24:30.886 --> 24:31.967
- Excuse me?
- Barry,

24:32.096 --> 24:33.462
we've had the worst luck, okay?

24:33.555 --> 24:37.674
From the Dominators and Savitar,
to gorillas, and now, these bus metas.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.927
And on top of everything else,
now, we're cursed.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.101
Iris, we're not cursed.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.475
Barry, look, you said that
you would marry me

24:43.565 --> 24:45.181
- anytime, anywhere.
- Well, this is...

24:45.275 --> 24:48.359
And I just feel if we don't get
married now, it's never gonna happen.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.936
That's not true, okay? I mean...

24:50.197 --> 24:52.063
Oh. Our turn. Our turn.
Go, go, go.

24:52.825 --> 24:53.815
Sorry.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.861
- Sorry.
- Excuse me. Beautiful service.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.949
- So sorry.
- I love this coffin...

24:59.039 --> 25:00.496
Hey, that's...

25:03.210 --> 25:04.200
- Hi.
- Hello.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.330
Can I help you?

25:05.421 --> 25:08.835
- Ah, yes, we would like to get married.
- Yes, we would.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.086
- Right now.
- Oh.

25:12.302 --> 25:15.010
Would you give us a moment
to reset the altar?

25:15.764 --> 25:18.802
Oh, no, no, that won't be necessary.
Look, we'll just... Watch. Watch.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.097
Hey? Okay.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.474
She's excited, sorry.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.472
Flip that around.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.686
- Yes.
- You shouldn't have done that.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.017
I know, it's fine.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.484
Okay.
We are here today to join...

25:33.699 --> 25:34.940
Um...

25:35.034 --> 25:37.526
- That's you.
- Me? Bartholomew Henry Allen.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.115
- And...
- Iris Ann West.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.867
...in holy matrimony.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.624
- Excuse me.
- You okay?

25:48.589 --> 25:50.000
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

25:51.925 --> 25:55.509
Kevin, did you use
the cinnamon incense?

25:55.596 --> 25:57.428
You know he's allergic to it.

25:58.599 --> 25:59.840
Shame on you!

25:59.933 --> 26:01.970
- No need to shame the little boy.
- No, you're fine.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.053
You're fine. Walk it off, Father.

26:06.607 --> 26:07.597
It's fine.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.559
- That did not just happen.
- You know, it was a...

26:11.487 --> 26:14.195
- Very nice funeral.
- Really, Barry?

26:29.505 --> 26:31.246
That was golden!

26:33.175 --> 26:35.462
Don't shoot, okay?
I'm here to apologize.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.845
I know you're trying to help us
fix our own colossal screw up.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.093
- Yeah, like always.
- Yeah, I know.

26:41.183 --> 26:42.640
I mean, I actually thought
you'd be at home by now,

26:42.726 --> 26:44.183
but here you are, working away.

26:44.812 --> 26:49.557
Well, things are a little complicated
on Earth-2.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.023
Huh.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.934
- Everything okay with Jesse?
- Yes.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.736
I mean, yes. If you must know,

26:55.823 --> 26:59.863
I spent the summer assembling
a support staff for her, so...

26:59.993 --> 27:01.825
- Oh, like Team Quick.
- No.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.285
- Team Jesse.
- No.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.988
- Jesse and the Quicksters?
- They're not called that.

27:05.082 --> 27:06.493
Well, they should be, that
sounds like an awesome team.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.370
It is an awesome team
because I assembled it.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.745
But then Jesse goes
and kicks me off the team, all right?

27:11.839 --> 27:16.004
Apparently, I'm too much like me,
whatever that means.

27:16.093 --> 27:20.303
I push too hard, you know? Too many
tests, too many training sessions.

27:20.514 --> 27:24.007
And I don't allow the team enough
time for their personal bonding.

27:24.101 --> 27:26.764
I don't understand Millennials.
Anyway, they took a vote.

27:26.854 --> 27:29.096
I'm out. I don't even have
a home to return to now.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.523
I can't even go back
to my own Earth.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.771
I'm sure you can empathize,
right, Ramon?

27:34.862 --> 27:38.276
'Cause you know what I'm like. Well,
you know what? We'll handle Sharpe.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.031
And then I'll be out of your hair.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.952
Guys, there are low probability
events happening all over the city.

27:53.046 --> 27:55.459
- Becky's quantum field is expanding.
- Okay, that's not possible.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.791
- Yeah, no, her powers were localized.
- Not anymore.

28:01.263 --> 28:03.926
Babe, you in there?
The door's jammed.

28:05.142 --> 28:06.474
One sec!

28:12.900 --> 28:15.392
Guys, the quantum field
is getting higher.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.108
My boss said you were
bad luck, sir, but I figured

28:20.199 --> 28:23.033
what are the odds a pilot has
a goose fly into his engine twice?

28:32.044 --> 28:33.034
Bird strike!

28:33.420 --> 28:34.410
Mayday.

28:34.504 --> 28:37.417
<i>This is Flight 512 to tower. We lost
an engine and are coming down.</i>

28:37.633 --> 28:39.044
When did Hazard get so powerful?

28:39.134 --> 28:40.966
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction. So...

28:41.053 --> 28:43.466
The more good luck she experiences,
the more bad luck she spreads.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.592
She must be experiencing
an extreme level of good luck

28:45.682 --> 28:47.344
for her quantum field
to be expanding like this.

28:47.434 --> 28:50.268
- Where is she now?
- She went back to work.

28:51.813 --> 28:56.057
Snake eyes!
For the 37th time.

28:56.610 --> 28:57.942
Bringing your winnings to

28:58.028 --> 29:01.146
- $1.2 million!
- ...million!

29:02.115 --> 29:03.151
Give me those things.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.985
Hi. Okay, here we go.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.070
Come on, mama!

29:09.957 --> 29:12.290
Guys, if Becky keeps winning,
then bad luck will keep spreading.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.412
This could destroy the whole city.

29:13.502 --> 29:14.913
- Okay, keep calm, all right?
- Okay, keep calm.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.460
Nothing's going wrong here.

29:18.465 --> 29:20.832
Guys, the particle accelerator
turned back on.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.085
It's gonna explode.

29:28.976 --> 29:31.013
Four minutes
to particle accelerator activation.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.140
<i>Harry, Cisco, status report?</i>

29:33.230 --> 29:35.267
Generators turned themselves on,
we gotta shut 'em down.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.976
Flight 512 to tower,
we're attempting a water landing.

29:40.362 --> 29:41.352
Cecile!

29:42.281 --> 29:43.271
Damn it.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.279
Barry, you've gotta find Hazard.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.492
<i>I'm almost at the casino.</i>

29:52.582 --> 29:54.244
Hazard's quantum field is increasing.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.324
How much worse can it get?

29:55.585 --> 29:57.668
Hello, my old friend.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.416
Let's keep this winning streak
going, shall we?

30:06.346 --> 30:09.214
Yes. Okay, cherry. Here we go, cherry.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.392
Cherry, cherry, cherry,
cherry, cherry, cherry.

30:12.769 --> 30:16.137
Cherry. Cherry! Cherry,
it's a cherry.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.980
Gimme two, gimme two.

30:20.193 --> 30:21.934
Cherry, cherry, cherry,
cherry, cherry, cherry.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.862
How is that even possible?

30:30.287 --> 30:31.277
Wait, no!

30:37.711 --> 30:39.077
Starboard's fan blade
is just disintegrated.

30:39.171 --> 30:40.332
We're not gonna make it to the water.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.538
- Barry, what happened?
<i>- Well...</i>

30:41.631 --> 30:45.045
She's playing the slots
and I cuffed myself.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.752
- Oh, honey.
- I know. We need to get 'em off.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.633
<i>They're dampening my powers.</i>

30:49.723 --> 30:51.089
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm trying.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.140
Hydrogen particle hatch.

30:53.643 --> 30:54.633
<i>We need to seal it.</i>

30:58.023 --> 30:59.013
Here we go.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.440
Cherry, bang bang.
Cherry, bang bang. Cherry!

31:02.152 --> 31:04.394
Cherry, bang bang, cherry.
Cherry, bang bang.

31:04.488 --> 31:05.604
There's two cherries.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.235
- Come on.
- Hey, look, it's the Flash!

31:08.367 --> 31:10.575
No, hey, there's no fire.
It's not a fire!

31:10.660 --> 31:12.902
Someone set off the alarm! Calm down!

31:14.873 --> 31:16.705
- Babe, you okay?
- I think so.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.116
Damn it, out back.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.577
- Out back. Be careful.
- Okay. Okay.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.206
<i>- One minute to activation.</i>
- Got it.

31:23.757 --> 31:26.249
- Nope, don't got it.
- That just opened the electron hatch.

31:28.762 --> 31:30.879
Yes, I am on fire, I know.

31:32.432 --> 31:33.843
There's no fire!

31:37.229 --> 31:38.219
Come on, cherry, pop.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.972
Cherry, pop, cherry.
Cherry, pop, cherry.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.226
Damn!

31:52.869 --> 31:54.326
Barry, I can't get the cuffs off.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.696
Yeah, well, now, we have a sign
to get off of me, too.

31:56.790 --> 31:59.282
Cherry number three.
Pop, cherry, pop.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.537
Brakes, brakes, brakes!

32:02.838 --> 32:04.374
<i>Thirty seconds to activation.</i>

32:04.881 --> 32:06.417
Nope, nope.

32:10.053 --> 32:12.511
- What're you doing? Come on.
- Wait, wait.

32:12.764 --> 32:13.754
- Let it go.
- What?

32:14.057 --> 32:15.093
- Let the accelerator turn on.
- Harry!

32:15.183 --> 32:18.096
Let the accelerator turn on.
Trust me.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.302
Ten seconds to activation.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.604
This is it. Last one!

32:22.441 --> 32:24.728
<i>Five, four,</i>

32:25.610 --> 32:27.522
three, two.

32:28.405 --> 32:29.395
Here we go.

32:35.829 --> 32:36.865
<i>Cherry, pop, cherry!</i>

32:42.544 --> 32:44.786
No. What? Star?

32:45.046 --> 32:48.130
No, I don't understand. I lost?

32:52.095 --> 32:54.883
The starboard thrusters are alive.
We're gonna make it.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.380
Good.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.469
What just happened?

33:08.111 --> 33:10.228
The hydrogen electron collision
released a charge

33:10.322 --> 33:13.986
that temporarily negated
Hazard's quantum field.

33:14.576 --> 33:15.783
We did it.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.151
You did it.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.658
How did you know to do that?

33:21.374 --> 33:22.706
Lucky guess.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.631
Okay.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.050
- Hi. Um...
- Hi.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.880
Is there, like, any chance that
you're not gonna arrest me?

33:38.934 --> 33:39.970
No?

33:40.310 --> 33:41.972
- I understand. Sure.
- Come on.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.852
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.266
- Right this way.
- Yep.

34:02.832 --> 34:03.822
Ramon.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.668
I owe you an apology.

34:12.509 --> 34:13.498
Okay.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.293
- That was it.
- Okay, all right.

34:16.388 --> 34:17.879
How about something like...

34:20.058 --> 34:22.641
"I am sorry for blaming
everything on you"?

34:22.936 --> 34:25.303
Or, "I am sorry for 'cursing' at you."

34:27.857 --> 34:29.188
Yep, that's good.

34:29.859 --> 34:32.226
That's good. That.
Pretend I said that.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.938
Guess I'll take it where I can get it.

34:35.197 --> 34:36.438
All right, good talk.

34:37.659 --> 34:38.945
<i>- Hey?</i>
- Hmm.

34:39.369 --> 34:40.780
You don't have to go back to Earth-2.

34:42.581 --> 34:43.571
What?

34:44.206 --> 34:45.322
You saved the day.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.042
That's your get-out-of-jackass-jail
free card.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.286
Plus, you're family.

34:52.007 --> 34:52.996
You'll always have a home here.

34:56.636 --> 34:57.626
Thank you...

34:59.764 --> 35:01.926
I appreciate the sentiment,
it's just that...

35:03.476 --> 35:05.684
- This is not my world.
- Oh, and Earth-2 is?

35:06.229 --> 35:08.095
<i>Did you make a bunch of friends
there that I don't know about?</i>

35:09.190 --> 35:12.024
Are they all tall, brooding dudes
with bad haircuts?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.851
I have...

35:14.946 --> 35:16.608
I have colleagues.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.063
<i>Work colleagues.</i>

35:18.491 --> 35:21.734
And some of them, I don't dislike.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.663
Exactly my point. You've spent
so much time worrying about Jesse

35:25.749 --> 35:27.741
and talking to dead people,

35:27.834 --> 35:29.996
that you never even stopped
to make a life for yourself.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.834
Wait a second, Ramon, are you
literally saying I don't have a life?

35:33.923 --> 35:37.462
That's exactly what I'm saying.
You don't have a life.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.886
But you can make one.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.173
With us, right here. We'll help you.

35:45.393 --> 35:48.261
'Cause God knows
you're gonna need that help.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.564
- No, I don't think so.
- I don't think so, either.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.659
Becky is locked up in the meta wing
at Iron Heights.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.283
Something tells me our bad luck
streak has come to an end.

36:06.373 --> 36:08.831
Good. We can't afford
to blow this place up a third time.

36:09.334 --> 36:13.248
So, look at these heat scans taken
from the satellite three weeks ago.

36:13.713 --> 36:14.920
<i>That's the Central City bus.</i>

36:15.799 --> 36:17.506
- That's the bus?
- That's the bus.

36:17.592 --> 36:19.879
Each of these heat scans
indicates a human body.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.045
Twelve markers, twelve metas.

36:22.389 --> 36:23.550
Now that we know how many there are,

36:23.640 --> 36:25.848
we won't have to wait for them
to come to us.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.134
- We can go right to them.
- Well, two down.

36:28.353 --> 36:29.844
Yep, we got this.

36:30.855 --> 36:31.845
Yeah, you do.

36:34.859 --> 36:35.849
What's wrong, Wally?

36:38.655 --> 36:41.898
You guys tell me. I mean,
the city was about to blow up,

36:42.575 --> 36:44.157
no one realized I wasn't here?

36:45.328 --> 36:46.614
Where did you go, Wall?

36:47.122 --> 36:49.865
I went to Earth-2, I had to talk
to Jesse, hear it from her.

36:50.667 --> 36:54.001
She told me she needs to focus
on herself, and I get it.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.629
<i>And I think I have to do
the same, right?</i>

36:59.426 --> 37:03.420
So, I'm leaving Central City.

37:04.848 --> 37:06.589
Where are you going?

37:07.100 --> 37:09.387
I'm gonna go stay with a friend
in Blue Valley for a while.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.062
Every hero has their own journey.

37:13.648 --> 37:17.107
If yours is taking you on a new path,
you owe it to yourself to go.

37:18.695 --> 37:19.685
Yeah.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.034
Good luck.

37:29.664 --> 37:30.654
Kid Flash.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.333
I don't want anything more

37:43.678 --> 37:45.920
<i>than for you to find
what you're looking for.</i>

37:47.140 --> 37:50.099
But I've spent so much time

37:50.685 --> 37:52.347
without you in my life.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.558
I don't wanna lose you.

37:57.984 --> 37:59.646
You'll never lose me, Dad.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.857
Plus, I'm a speedster.
You need me and I'll come running.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.030
I love you, son.

38:09.746 --> 38:10.736
Yeah. Love you.

38:19.506 --> 38:20.496
You sure?

38:22.717 --> 38:23.707
Yeah.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.963
Well, don't forget, Central City
will always be the home of Kid Flash.

38:29.849 --> 38:30.839
I won't.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.930
- Don't be a stranger.
- No.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.729
- I love you.
- I love you more.

38:40.443 --> 38:41.433
Okay.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.787
West leaves.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.454
Allen returns, West leaves.
Move, counter-move.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.623
- What's your point?
- Simply that

39:01.297 --> 39:03.539
a mysterious stranger comes to town

39:03.925 --> 39:05.291
to seek out the Flash...

39:05.510 --> 39:07.547
Causes us to open the Speed Force.

39:07.637 --> 39:10.254
Which causes the creation
of a dozen new metas.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.338
Right.

39:11.432 --> 39:14.425
Hold on, you think the guy
behind the samurai robot...

39:14.519 --> 39:15.509
Samuroid.

39:16.187 --> 39:19.601
You think he wanted us to create
a busload of metas?

39:20.191 --> 39:21.272
I think it's all connected.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.351
Why would anyone wanna create metas?

39:23.570 --> 39:24.560
I don't know.

39:25.530 --> 39:28.443
Whoever they are, they've got
a seriously warped way of thinking.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.532
They identified the targets
sooner than we planned.

39:35.498 --> 39:38.991
Perhaps they're smarter
than you gave them credit.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.204
Perhaps.

39:47.552 --> 39:49.168
But I'm smarter.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.606
Oh!

40:06.696 --> 40:09.484
Just when I thought it was safe
to get back in the house.

40:09.574 --> 40:13.067
Hey. I may not be a craftsman expert
such as yourself,

40:13.161 --> 40:15.369
but I can handle plastering
a couple of holes in the wall.

40:16.456 --> 40:18.288
Babe, you don't have to do this.

40:18.499 --> 40:22.288
This is our home and it is
a disaster zone right now,

40:22.378 --> 40:24.916
so, I'm doing my part to fix it up.

40:25.006 --> 40:27.248
Oh... I appreciate that.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.178
But, you know, Cecile...

40:35.516 --> 40:37.098
- You were right.
- Hmm?

40:37.644 --> 40:39.681
It's time for me to let this place go.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.771
I... It took me a minute to get there,

40:42.857 --> 40:45.770
I'm not good with change,
you know that, but once I did,

40:46.653 --> 40:49.521
I realized that whatever house
I'm in with you,

40:50.490 --> 40:51.480
I'm gonna love.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.279
So, we might as well get one
with a dishwasher,

40:55.745 --> 40:56.952
and a Jacuzzi.

40:58.164 --> 40:59.405
Jacuzzi.

40:59.791 --> 41:00.998
Oh...

41:03.962 --> 41:05.999
- I love you.
- I love you.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.673
- Funny thing, babe.
- Hmm?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.760
I've actually had a change of heart.

41:15.431 --> 41:16.638
- What?
- Hmm.

41:17.934 --> 41:19.220
You wanna stay?

41:19.769 --> 41:20.850
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:24.941 --> 41:28.059
You told me that you couldn't have
asked for a better place

41:28.152 --> 41:30.235
to raise your kids and

41:31.239 --> 41:33.731
it made me look at this house
with new eyes.

41:35.618 --> 41:38.076
Especially after I found out...

41:45.420 --> 41:46.410
Joe...

41:48.381 --> 41:49.667
I'm pregnant.

41:53.761 --> 41:54.877
Joe?

41:58.099 --> 41:59.180
Joe?
