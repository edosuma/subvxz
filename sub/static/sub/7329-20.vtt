00:15.683 --> 00:17.360
Help! Help me!

00:17.384 --> 00:18.695
Somebody help, please!

00:18.719 --> 00:19.863
Oh, God!

00:19.887 --> 00:21.498
Help me!

00:21.522 --> 00:22.899
I'm coming! Hang on!

00:22.923 --> 00:25.025
- I'm coming!
- Please! Help!

01:05.364 --> 01:07.276
I thought you said 27,000 kills.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.578
28,000 kills.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.513
But yesterday,
you said 27,000 kills.

01:10.537 --> 01:11.715
That was yesterday.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.650
You killed 1,000 people
in a day?

01:13.674 --> 01:15.185
I was hot. I was super hot.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.319
I was cappin' fools.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.954
It's not a cause
for pride, McGee.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.723
It's a cause for concern.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.658
Speaking of causes for concern.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.026
Autopsy gremlin.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.961
What are you doing in here?

01:24.985 --> 01:26.830
You know what happens if the
direct sunlight hits your skin.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.299
I was just showing Ziva pictures
of me and Breena.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.034
Things are getting
pretty serious with

01:31.058 --> 01:32.469
- the girlfriend, huh?
- Oh, I don't know...

01:32.493 --> 01:34.871
Ooh! Matching tattoos.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.240
Well, it's just henna.
I-It's just... it's just henna.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.043
- It's going to be gone in a few days.
- Let me just see.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.879
You got commitment issues,
Palmer?

01:42.903 --> 01:44.214
I get a little nervous about...

01:44.238 --> 01:45.649
permanent things.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.184
Actually, I can't even put
a bumper sticker on my car.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.586
TONY Where is this?

01:49.610 --> 01:51.554
Looks like
the Baltimore Street Scene.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.023
McGee, didn't you say
you wanted to go to that?

01:53.047 --> 01:55.225
I decided not to.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.627
Did you really make
that decision, McGee,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.362
or was it made for you

01:59.386 --> 02:01.197
by your addiction to killing?

02:01.221 --> 02:02.532
McGee killed 1,000 people
yesterday.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.834
Huh? That is not the record.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.069
On his video game.

02:06.093 --> 02:09.104
Oh. Is that a record?

02:09.128 --> 02:11.131
- That's pretty good.
- Thank you, Palmer.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.244
We're not encouraging
this kind of behavior.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.679
You spent, like, six hours
online last night.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.748
You need to unplug,
talk to real people.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.950
Uh, these are real people, Tony.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.086
Living, breathing people
with lungs and skin

02:23.110 --> 02:25.622
you can touch and interact
with... we got to find you

02:25.646 --> 02:26.623
one of those.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.391
Yeah, well,
I got one of the other kind.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.093
Petty officer washed up
on a Maryland beach.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.227
Grab your stuff.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.344
Oh, all right!

02:34.655 --> 02:37.100
That is not an appropriate
reaction, is it?

02:37.124 --> 02:39.402
I know, boss.
I'm as shocked as you are,

02:39.426 --> 02:41.771
but Ziva invited the gremlin
up here.

02:41.795 --> 02:44.628
Don't get him wet.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.378
Mind your step, Mr. Palmer.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.529
- Minding my step, sir.
- It's slippery.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.921
Where's the burrito wrap?

02:57.945 --> 02:59.022
Got it right here, Doctor.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.457
And here is the body bag.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.058
Now, let's lay it out here.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.827
It's gnarly, dude.

03:03.851 --> 03:04.828
Man!

03:04.852 --> 03:06.996
Yeah! For real!

03:07.020 --> 03:08.331
Words.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.100
Use them... helpful words.

03:10.124 --> 03:12.001
We-we were sleeping
in a van, yo, right?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.737
And we heard... Bam! Bam!

03:13.761 --> 03:15.138
Boom! Boom! Crack! Crack!

03:15.162 --> 03:16.573
Gunshots, dude.
That's what I said.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.174
I was, like,
"Dude, gunshots," right?

03:18.198 --> 03:21.077
So, you're saying there
were six gunshots?

03:21.101 --> 03:23.113
- N-N-N-No...
- No, two gunshots.

03:23.137 --> 03:24.848
But there was, like, a echo.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.483
And he was, like, "Dude,
don't look," and I was, like,

03:26.507 --> 03:28.084
- "Dude, we're looking."
- Yeah, and-and-and...

03:28.108 --> 03:30.153
and then we, like, peeked
through the windows,

03:30.177 --> 03:33.356
and we saw two dudes drive off
in a black Lincoln.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.940
Two? You sure it was two?
It wasn't an echo?

03:36.784 --> 03:38.895
Yeah, two dudes.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.352
Two dudes.

03:41.588 --> 03:43.266
Right there.

03:43.290 --> 03:44.621
Okay.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.171
All right, well,
fingerprint scan

03:48.195 --> 03:49.739
matches his Navy I.D.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.574
Petty Officer Scott Roebuck.

03:51.598 --> 03:54.110
Lived within walking distance
from here.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.612
Actually, within
jogging distance, I'd say.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.013
Does your new

03:57.037 --> 04:00.283
magical machine tell you
how he died, Timothy?

04:00.307 --> 04:02.886
Well, it's not much

04:02.910 --> 04:04.187
of a noodle-scratcher
there, Duck,

04:04.211 --> 04:06.523
but I'm going to say GSW
to the head.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.192
Well, McGee would know...
head shots are his specialty.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.627
What?

04:10.651 --> 04:13.029
He's referring to a video game
he's been playing way too much.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.731
That's a surprising bit

04:14.755 --> 04:15.999
of editorializing, coming from

04:16.023 --> 04:18.168
the once and future
king of Dorkland.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.970
Hey, I now have a girlfriend.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.206
The king is dead.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.742
Long live the king.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.344
Hey! What do you got?

04:28.368 --> 04:29.712
Hey, boss.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.648
We, uh,

04:31.672 --> 04:34.484
found Petty Officer Roebuck's,
uh, MP3

04:34.508 --> 04:36.152
down at the end of the dock.

04:36.176 --> 04:39.656
Must have fallen off
before he went in the water.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.391
With his shoes on?

04:41.415 --> 04:43.660
Well, either he was shot first
and thrown in,

04:43.684 --> 04:45.495
or he went in
after something important.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.996
Or someone.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.432
How about the tides?

04:49.456 --> 04:50.889
Let's see.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.404
At this latitude,
high tide was at 11:00 p.m.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.606
So, we're still going down.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.565
Special Agent Gibbs...
found something!

05:04.104 --> 05:05.882
Wow, this is terrible.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.350
All right, Tony, let's hook him.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.852
I believe it's called a gaff.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.553
- What is?
- Uh, the hook.

05:10.577 --> 05:12.255
Well, you don't seem
to be gaffing very well,

05:12.279 --> 05:13.289
so try hooking.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.557
You know, I used to like

05:14.581 --> 05:16.025
spending time with you.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.227
Got him?

05:17.251 --> 05:20.063
I'll get another body bag.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.966
He's been beaten about the face.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.334
His hands and legs are bound.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.535
The chains must have snagged

05:25.559 --> 05:26.970
when the tides went down.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.805
McGee, put the scanner on.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.064
All right. Thanks, boss.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.777
There we go.

05:34.801 --> 05:36.145
Okay.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.582
Well, no names
coming up in AFIS.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.651
Oh, wait a second, boss,
we got a red flag here.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.438
It says contact the FBI.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.423
I think I recognize this guy.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.825
- Isn't it?
- Stefano Delmar.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.126
Who?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.294
Organized crime.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.662
Up-and-comer.

05:52.693 --> 05:56.424
Our petty officer stumbled
onto a hit.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.376
You sure it's Delmar?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.377
Can't be sure.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.845
The file just said
contact the FBI.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.948
Saves me a trip to the rooftop
to flash the Gibbs Signal.

06:11.972 --> 06:15.752
You, uh... still investigating
those Mob hits?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.403
Hence the undercover beard.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.690
I'm worried.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.292
It gets a little bigger...

06:22.316 --> 06:24.527
People are going to start
thinking you're Kenny Rogers.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.863
- The hits...
- I'm going to start calling you the Gambler.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.252
Not the beard.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.636
Yeah, what is this?

06:33.660 --> 06:36.039
That is just a small portion
of Stefano Delmar's

06:36.063 --> 06:37.807
sworn testimony
to the grand jury.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.043
- He turned state's evidence.
- He was trying

06:40.067 --> 06:41.277
to consolidate power,

06:41.301 --> 06:43.146
till we caught him cold
on a murder charge

06:43.170 --> 06:45.114
and he decided to give
everyone else up instead.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.883
He's done a whole lot
of talking.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.552
He was supposed to be on his way
into witness protection.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.120
Hmm, but now he's dead.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.355
Uh, yeah.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.524
And he's not the first.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.660
Someone is not doing
a very good job

06:57.684 --> 07:00.209
of protecting witnesses.

07:05.525 --> 07:06.936
There is cortisone cream

07:06.960 --> 07:10.106
in the far cabinet,
Mr. Palmer, for your itching.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.808
I think it's in my head, Doctor.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.443
Yeah, but you're
scratching your back.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.178
No, sometimes when I
get around sand,

07:15.202 --> 07:17.947
I just start itching.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.682
Well, if you'd care to explore

07:19.706 --> 07:21.017
the origins of this
psychological affliction,

07:21.041 --> 07:23.853
I can offer
my professional services.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.556
What's the first thing
that springs to mind?

07:26.580 --> 07:29.092
Well, I really liked to play
in the sand when I was a kid.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.495
I used to bury my toys,
play amateur archaeologist.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.698
Our neighbors, I remember, did
some remodeling once, and they

07:35.722 --> 07:37.200
had a big pile of sand
out front.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.534
To mix with cement.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.570
Yeah, yeah,
but it wasn't sand-sand,

07:40.594 --> 07:43.106
like good sand...
it was bad sand; Very bad sand.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.708
- Made me break out in red welts.
- Oh, it wasn't

07:45.732 --> 07:48.244
the sand, Mr. Palmer,
but the sand mite.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.979
The sand might what?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.547
The sand mite bit you.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.082
Sand bites?

07:53.106 --> 07:54.651
Well, sand mites might bite.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.853
I'm grammatically lost.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.122
But medically found.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.671
The tiny crustacean
known as the mite.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.227
M-I-T-E.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.628
I believe

08:05.652 --> 08:08.865
a simple allergy is the solution
to this problem.

08:08.889 --> 08:12.201
That's your conclusion, Doctor?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.003
Delmar was allergic to seawater?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.672
Well, to breathing it, perhaps.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.173
His lungs were full.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.709
Cause of death was,
in fact, drowning.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.645
- He was thrown in alive.
- Petty officer

08:22.669 --> 08:24.347
was trying to be
a Good Samaritan.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.896
No good deed goes unpunished.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.921
Yeah...

08:31.945 --> 08:33.322
That's Delmar, all right.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.692
This is the first body
that's actually turned up.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.360
Confirms the word on the street.

08:37.384 --> 08:38.828
What about the other two hits?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.596
Disappeared.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.554
Presumably
with extreme prejudice.

08:44.858 --> 08:48.438
FBI recently lost
a few witnesses.

08:48.462 --> 08:49.605
"Lost"?

08:49.629 --> 08:51.274
Well, we advise against it,

08:51.298 --> 08:53.376
but it's not uncommon
for witnesses

08:53.400 --> 08:55.244
to reject
the protection program,

08:55.268 --> 08:58.247
try to return
to their... their own lives.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.750
Delmar never even got
to his new home.

09:00.774 --> 09:01.918
You got a leak?

09:01.942 --> 09:03.519
Maybe.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.956
The Bureau's hands-on
until the testimony's complete.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.758
Then the marshals take over.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.027
We varied protocols,
just in case.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.663
Well, whoever killed him
took the job personally.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.565
I mean, he was not only
beaten around the face,

09:15.589 --> 09:18.501
but the torso, as well,
before being drowned.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.036
Like a rat.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.606
Yeah, well, I did find
one unexplained wound.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.775
Here... there's also
an infection.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.777
I suspect tetanus.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.112
What, those little scabs?

09:29.136 --> 09:31.414
Yeah, they're some sort
of punctures.

09:31.438 --> 09:34.550
About a week old, maybe two.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.120
He was in FBI custody last week?

09:37.144 --> 09:39.455
And the week before that.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.710
Oh, yeah, Tobias,
you've got a leak.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.544
All right, let's get moving.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.634
Okay, "FBI witness profile

09:51.658 --> 09:53.136
and sequestering schedule."

09:53.160 --> 09:54.904
Reminds me of middle school,

09:54.928 --> 09:56.506
when you get the smart kids

09:56.530 --> 09:57.974
to check
the dumb kids' homework.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.533
Yeah, which one were you?

10:00.967 --> 10:03.980
And that's because I anointed
you king of Dorkland?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.515
Fair enough.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.216
Let's start
with the safe houses.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.552
- I got a Motel 6.
- Freemont Inn.

10:09.576 --> 10:10.787
Got a Hyatt.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.688
Wow, must be nice to have
a budget for hotels.

10:12.712 --> 10:14.290
Moving on.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.326
Special agent in charge... hey!

10:17.350 --> 10:18.494
Look, there's my old buddy,

10:18.518 --> 10:19.829
Rick Sacks.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.130
Kind of hope he's the leak.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.298
Robertson.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.567
- Van Horn.
- Moving on.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.803
Appointment
with a company called.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.805
Cooper's Hawk Security.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.573
Me, too.

10:30.597 --> 10:31.741
Yeah, me, three.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.910
All right, Cooper's,
you go to the top

10:33.934 --> 10:35.745
of the "maybe" pile.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.236
Cooper's Hawk Security?

10:38.271 --> 10:39.882
Outside contractor...

10:39.906 --> 10:41.450
background checks, securities.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.453
They specialize
in polygraph investigations.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.556
Lie detectors are inadmissible.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.258
We occasionally use them
to verify statements

10:49.282 --> 10:50.326
before we get to court.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.061
Really? You can't just take

10:52.085 --> 10:54.197
what career criminals say
at face value?

10:54.221 --> 10:56.866
Even after agreeing to full
disclosure, some witnesses

10:56.890 --> 10:58.968
try to hold back,
but with a skilled technician,

10:58.992 --> 11:00.254
the polygraph will catch them.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.806
Son of a bitch.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.309
That's what happened
to Delmar's foot.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.944
The old tack
in the shoe routine.

11:07.968 --> 11:10.179
Pain messes up the baseline
reading when you tell the truth.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.582
It makes it difficult to get
an accurate read on a lie.

11:12.606 --> 11:16.052
If the wounds
are self-inflicted,

11:16.076 --> 11:17.587
the leak might be
outside the Bureau.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.322
Leak could be
in that company, Tobias.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.623
Common link
to all three witnesses.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.792
We should put someone
in there, see how they operate.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.160
Enough undercover work.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.394
Let's do this the easy way.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.029
We get the judge
off the last trial

11:27.053 --> 11:28.698
to issue a court order
for their internals.

11:28.722 --> 11:31.000
Find the name of anyone
who interacted with all three.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.435
All right, we'll do it your way.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.170
Let's go.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.405
There are two kinds
of people in the world:

11:36.429 --> 11:37.874
The kind that actually believes

11:37.898 --> 11:39.909
there's only two kinds
of people,

11:39.933 --> 11:42.445
and the kind
that ain't total idiots.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.080
Your Honor,

11:44.104 --> 11:47.316
if you'd review my request,
you'd see that I'm not asking

11:47.340 --> 11:49.585
to violate
client confidentiality.

11:49.609 --> 11:52.255
Not in those words,
Agent Fornell,

11:52.279 --> 11:54.257
but that would be the effect.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.025
If I granted the court order.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.194
So much for the easy way.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.962
- How is that?
- Ignore him, Your Honor.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.498
"Evelyn" is fine
when I'm not in the robe.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.133
Why can't we just have them all,
Judge?

12:04.157 --> 12:07.570
Cooper's handles sensitive
information, Agent Gibbs.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.771
They're a reputable firm

12:08.795 --> 12:10.740
with a very large
private clientele base,

12:10.764 --> 12:12.341
not to mention
the federal government.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.311
A two-man hit team
took down Stefano Delmar.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.280
And you think his people
knew he was talking

12:17.304 --> 12:19.015
because someone at Cooper's
let it slip?

12:19.039 --> 12:22.251
Tobias, that was one of
the worst-kept secrets in town.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.886
It's the same team that killed
Petty Officer Roebuck

12:23.910 --> 12:24.968
just for being there.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.324
I share your frustration

12:28.348 --> 12:30.960
with the occasional inequities
of the legal system,

12:30.984 --> 12:32.762
but I cannot sign off

12:32.786 --> 12:35.653
on blanket violations
of privacy.

12:37.490 --> 12:41.337
In the hopes of serving justice,
however,

12:41.361 --> 12:44.228
I could release Delmar's
full testimony to you.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.832
At least you could find out
what names he named.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.331
It would help narrow down
our search for the killers.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.918
Thank you... Evelyn.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.120
And I could buy you both
a coffee.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.338
Pick your poison.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.726
You had a cup this morning,
didn't you?

13:03.750 --> 13:05.428
Yeah. Every morning.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.297
And Judge Wallace
bought you one.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.033
What is that, your fifth?

13:11.057 --> 13:13.369
It's not even 4:00 yet.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.904
Hey, boss, I might have found

13:14.928 --> 13:17.707
a way into, uh,
Cooper's Hawk Security.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.475
Yep.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.477
Yeah?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.264
I didn't know you were looking.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.448
Well, it's not illegal.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.949
I'm not hacking or anything.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.451
Right.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.186
Did you start looking

13:30.210 --> 13:32.337
after we saw the judge?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.847
Or before?

13:38.752 --> 13:40.196
Before.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.198
Right.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.699
Thanks for doing it my way.

13:43.723 --> 13:44.834
Yeah, don't mention it.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.402
- I was being facetious.
- Yeah, me, too.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.792
Cooper's personnel files.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.640
Susan Grady?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.075
That's the polygraph lady.

13:53.099 --> 13:54.477
You know her?

13:54.501 --> 13:56.712
Says she's one
of their specialists.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.147
Yeah, she's one
of our specialists, too.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.482
More precisely...

13:59.506 --> 14:01.517
one of McGee's specialists,

14:01.541 --> 14:03.819
meaning she specializes
in McGee.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.921
And polygraphs.

14:05.945 --> 14:07.623
Employment histories overlapped.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.842
Looks like she was moonlighting.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.429
I'm an 080 security specialist,

14:13.453 --> 14:14.530
not a full-time agent.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.032
I got clearance
from the director

14:16.056 --> 14:17.533
before I started freelancing.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.168
Wait. Director Vance knows?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.237
No, this was Director Shepard.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.706
This was, I think,
February of '08.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.174
Susan, you're not in trouble.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.442
I know I'm not in trouble.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.377
I haven't broken
any regulations.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.578
Then stop acting defensive.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.780
I'm not acting.

14:30.804 --> 14:32.481
I'm genuinely feeling
on the defensive.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.418
You have a very off-putting way
of putting people...

14:35.442 --> 14:37.420
you know, off.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.955
I'm not the first one to say it.

14:39.979 --> 14:41.424
It's not my fault
you feel guilty.

14:41.448 --> 14:44.527
Sure, I guess I could have
reminded Director Vance

14:44.551 --> 14:47.096
when he took the desk,
and I could have told them "no"

14:47.120 --> 14:48.697
when they offered me
a more regular job.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.932
Or you could have told them

14:49.956 --> 14:52.034
- that you already have a job.
- It's still part-time.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.803
Two days a week, usually,

14:53.827 --> 14:57.263
unless they have a...
unusually heavy caseload or...

15:00.066 --> 15:02.311
Stay down! Stay down!

15:02.335 --> 15:04.070
Oh, my God!

15:16.815 --> 15:20.061
All noncombustible items
on the left.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.430
If it's fried, on the right.

15:22.454 --> 15:25.099
And mark a big "O"
on anything organic.

15:25.123 --> 15:27.335
Abby, do you really
need that thing?

15:27.359 --> 15:29.370
Need, McGee?

15:29.394 --> 15:31.039
Reason not the need, McGee.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.940
Don't be so limited.

15:32.964 --> 15:35.376
If it smells, bring it

15:35.400 --> 15:37.879
- directly to my lab, pronto.
- Noncombustible.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.514
McGee, we got a cause yet?

15:39.538 --> 15:41.683
Uh, well,
I called the fire marshal.

15:41.707 --> 15:43.718
He is, uh, still not ready
to sign off

15:43.742 --> 15:46.354
on the cause of the explosion,
but he is willing to admit

15:46.378 --> 15:48.489
- that it probably was not an accident.
- You think?

15:48.513 --> 15:49.957
Where's DiNozzo and David?

15:49.981 --> 15:52.160
Still out canvassing.
How is Susan?

15:52.184 --> 15:54.562
She's in the conference room...
go find out.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.364
What, you want me
to go question her?

15:56.388 --> 15:58.032
She's in shock, Tim.

15:58.056 --> 15:59.767
We're going to need
a gentle touch,

15:59.791 --> 16:01.369
and based on
your past relationship...

16:01.393 --> 16:03.471
Whoa, whoa... relationship?
There-there was no relationship.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.139
That's not how I remember it.

16:05.163 --> 16:07.608
Boss, she practically
sexually harassed me.

16:07.632 --> 16:09.544
I get chills just thinking

16:09.568 --> 16:11.468
about the EKG
that she was sticking up...

16:13.038 --> 16:15.165
Conference room.

16:22.881 --> 16:24.459
Hey.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.950
You okay?

16:27.919 --> 16:30.164
Well, maybe I can...

16:30.188 --> 16:32.179
Thank you. I was so scared.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.805
You have a surveillance camera

16:37.829 --> 16:40.208
in the conference room now?

16:40.232 --> 16:42.643
Hope you don't have one
in the elevator.

16:42.667 --> 16:43.911
We don't.

16:43.935 --> 16:47.014
Not yet, at least,
Agent Fornell.

16:47.038 --> 16:48.316
How can I help you?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.084
Need to borrow your TV.

16:50.108 --> 16:53.043
And my copy of Emily Post.
Door was closed.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.957
I thought you were in MTAC.

16:55.981 --> 16:57.191
Well, we all make mistakes.

16:57.215 --> 16:59.093
That's why God
invented knocking.

16:59.117 --> 17:01.496
McGee is interviewing
Susan Grady?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.365
You sure you don't have
a camera in the elevator?

17:04.388 --> 17:07.602
When I do, you'll be the first
to know, Agent Fornell.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.904
TV's all yours.

17:09.928 --> 17:11.172
Susan...

17:11.195 --> 17:12.205
Let go. Let go.

17:12.230 --> 17:13.540
Thank you. Thank you.

17:13.565 --> 17:14.876
Now, I know it's hard, okay?

17:14.900 --> 17:16.877
But I'm going to need you
to focus.

17:16.902 --> 17:19.347
- Can you do that for me?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.550
All right, so I'm going to have
to ask you a few questions.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.085
That's funny.

17:24.108 --> 17:27.021
I'm usually the one
who asks the questions.

17:27.045 --> 17:29.605
Yeah, I remember.

17:30.749 --> 17:33.027
You know,
we never really got a chance

17:33.051 --> 17:37.432
to talk about the, um...

17:37.456 --> 17:39.734
You know, the, remember?

17:39.758 --> 17:41.936
The time that you had me
retake my polygraph test,

17:41.960 --> 17:43.971
because you wanted to see
if I had a girlfriend or not?

17:43.995 --> 17:45.807
I know it was wrong,
and I'm sorry.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.208
I took care of that.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.509
It's just I... I...

17:48.533 --> 17:50.511
think you're really cute,
and I...

17:50.535 --> 17:52.280
Don't worry about it, Susan.

17:52.304 --> 17:53.548
It's okay, all right?

17:53.572 --> 17:55.483
Just water under the bridge.

17:55.507 --> 17:56.867
Let's just forget
it ever happened.

17:58.343 --> 17:59.787
All right, now,
you've been working

17:59.811 --> 18:02.323
at Cooper's Hawk Security
about two years?

18:02.347 --> 18:04.725
And you help them run
their background checks?

18:04.749 --> 18:07.495
No, I just administer
polygraphs.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.130
So, same as here.

18:09.154 --> 18:10.731
No, not the same.

18:10.755 --> 18:12.467
Here, everyone treats me
like a leper.

18:12.491 --> 18:15.069
I walk into a room,
they walk out.

18:15.093 --> 18:18.139
Like... like everyone's
afraid I'm going to find out

18:18.163 --> 18:20.575
their deepest, darkest secrets.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.710
But, um, Cooper's specializes

18:22.734 --> 18:24.879
in giving polygraphs.

18:24.903 --> 18:27.482
There, I was just...
one of the guys,

18:27.506 --> 18:29.064
which was nice.

18:30.475 --> 18:33.273
I can't believe
they're all dead.

18:39.684 --> 18:40.962
This man...

18:40.986 --> 18:43.064
You ever given him a polygraph?

18:43.088 --> 18:44.732
No.

18:44.756 --> 18:48.169
You aware of any threats
against Cooper's Hawk?

18:48.193 --> 18:49.237
No.

18:49.261 --> 18:51.172
Anything unusual
in the office this morning?

18:51.196 --> 18:53.274
No, the Internet was down
for a bit,

18:53.298 --> 18:55.376
but nothing unusual about that.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.978
The, uh, the techs came,

18:57.002 --> 18:59.213
and it was working
about an hour later.

18:59.237 --> 19:01.516
All right.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.117
Think I've got enough for now.

19:03.141 --> 19:05.253
Um, how'd I do?

19:05.277 --> 19:07.922
Uh, just fine. Just fine.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.323
I'll admit, the,

19:09.347 --> 19:11.459
the Q and A is a little
nerve-wracking.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.495
I see what everyone's
talking about.

19:14.519 --> 19:16.097
Yeah.

19:16.121 --> 19:17.952
But I'm glad it was you.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.804
It's... it's almost like...

19:23.828 --> 19:27.787
fate brought us together again.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.449
Maybe I ought to have
a little talk with her.

19:35.473 --> 19:36.851
I don't think
she knows anything.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.020
If she can be trusted.

19:39.044 --> 19:40.955
You're sure the leak
came from Cooper's Hawk?

19:40.979 --> 19:42.857
The explosion
wasn't an accident.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.292
There was something
to find there.

19:44.316 --> 19:47.228
And somebody didn't want you
to find it.

19:47.252 --> 19:49.497
And she's the only one
that made it out alive.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.532
Either she's extraordinarily
lucky...

19:51.556 --> 19:53.167
Or she's involved.

19:53.191 --> 19:55.436
Until we know which is which,

19:55.460 --> 19:57.451
let's not let her
out of our sight.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.642
I need help, Doctor.

20:01.666 --> 20:04.612
I can't tell whether
this is a metacarpal

20:04.636 --> 20:06.314
or a metatarsal bone.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.983
Neither.
No, it's the lower extremity

20:09.007 --> 20:10.551
of a Lepus cuniculus.

20:10.575 --> 20:12.587
A rabbit's foot?

20:12.611 --> 20:14.922
Yeah. Look at the markings
here on the end.

20:14.946 --> 20:18.225
It's where the metal
keychain cap was attached.

20:18.249 --> 20:21.696
Huh, someone must've been
carrying this for good luck.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.521
Wonder if they can get
their money back.

20:24.756 --> 20:27.335
I am so sorry.
Uh, th-that was just a joke,

20:27.359 --> 20:29.570
and it was... it was not a...
a good joke.

20:29.594 --> 20:31.061
I realize that now.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.441
DNA! I need more.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.242
I finished I.D.'ing
the first four victims.

20:35.266 --> 20:38.512
Ugh! And, uh, I'm ready
for a new batch.

20:38.536 --> 20:39.680
Mr. Palmer, if you've

20:39.704 --> 20:42.416
finished your multispecies
insensitivity...

20:42.440 --> 20:45.386
Uh, here are two more.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.088
It's going slow.

20:47.112 --> 20:48.856
We've been having trouble

20:48.880 --> 20:50.858
separating out
the unique DNA strands.

20:50.882 --> 20:52.193
I have faith.

20:52.217 --> 20:54.028
If anyone can dig through
burnt-out remains

20:54.052 --> 20:56.597
and find uncooked
cellular material, it's you two.

20:56.621 --> 20:59.533
Ugh! Remind me not to let
you give a speech at my wedding.

20:59.557 --> 21:00.968
Ducky, Gibbs would like

21:00.992 --> 21:03.070
to know, uh, what the update is

21:03.094 --> 21:05.573
with the bodies
that we discovered.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.475
Well, there are still
some spare parts,

21:07.499 --> 21:10.077
but we've been able
to reconstruct

21:10.101 --> 21:13.648
enough of the remains
to get a firm count.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.149
There are ten victims,

21:15.173 --> 21:16.697
not counting the rabbit.

21:17.742 --> 21:19.253
Are you sure?

21:19.277 --> 21:21.322
You were expecting
something different?

21:21.346 --> 21:22.923
I... I don't know
what the rabbit

21:22.947 --> 21:24.925
is about, but according
to the personnel records,

21:24.949 --> 21:27.395
there should've been 11 people
in the building when it blew up.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.562
Well, I can assure you

21:28.586 --> 21:32.500
our count is, uh,
accurate... ten.

21:32.524 --> 21:36.270
Susan Grady was not the only
person who made it out alive.

21:36.294 --> 21:38.455
So who's lucky 11?

21:39.831 --> 21:41.075
Well, wouldn't Susan know?

21:41.099 --> 21:42.410
She was there, right?

21:42.434 --> 21:44.111
Are you guys sure
that we can trust her?

21:44.135 --> 21:45.246
Because I am not.

21:45.270 --> 21:47.748
And why, may I ask, is that?

21:47.772 --> 21:49.216
Come on, Ducky.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.919
Everybody knows Susan's taken
a little shine to McGee.

21:51.943 --> 21:54.255
That has nothing to do with it.

21:54.279 --> 21:57.291
I mean, McGee...
he's a capable investigator,

21:57.315 --> 21:59.660
but when it comes
to matters of the heart,

21:59.684 --> 22:01.662
he can be a bit naive.

22:01.686 --> 22:05.332
Are you talking from experience?

22:05.356 --> 22:07.034
That's classified.

22:07.058 --> 22:09.070
Just think about
his last girlfriend.

22:09.094 --> 22:10.538
She tried to kill him.

22:10.562 --> 22:12.039
I get it.

22:12.063 --> 22:16.010
You're trying to cover McGee,
like a protective hen.

22:16.034 --> 22:18.512
Or an over-protective panther.

22:18.536 --> 22:21.415
Okay, if Susan can't tell you

22:21.439 --> 22:23.517
who lucky number 11 is, I can.

22:23.541 --> 22:25.532
Just keep her out of my hair.

22:27.178 --> 22:28.322
Should we tell her?

22:28.346 --> 22:29.457
No way.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.312
Tell her what?

22:32.117 --> 22:33.494
Keep pumping.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.529
How firm do you like it?

22:35.553 --> 22:36.530
A little harder.

22:36.554 --> 22:37.531
All right.

22:37.555 --> 22:39.633
Don't want to get a stiff back.

22:39.657 --> 22:41.302
Hm! Pretty good...

22:41.326 --> 22:43.204
Top of the line.

22:43.228 --> 22:45.423
Any more, I think
it's gonna pop.

22:46.431 --> 22:49.710
Wow... McGee.

22:49.734 --> 22:51.378
And in my lab.

22:51.402 --> 22:52.747
What?

22:52.771 --> 22:54.682
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, oh...

22:54.706 --> 22:57.151
- No!
- No. Listen, Abby, I volunteered

22:57.175 --> 22:58.953
your lab for Susan to crash in.

22:58.977 --> 23:01.489
I mean, if it's that big
of a problem, I can...

23:01.513 --> 23:03.381
have her stay at my place,
I guess.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.061
No problem.

23:07.085 --> 23:09.330
No problem, and there's pillows

23:09.354 --> 23:10.765
in the ballistics room.

23:10.789 --> 23:12.433
Oh, um, already got them.

23:12.457 --> 23:13.667
Thank you.

23:13.691 --> 23:15.202
Great.

23:15.226 --> 23:17.838
Well, if you need anything,

23:17.862 --> 23:19.607
I'll be

23:19.631 --> 23:22.065
closing in on the killer
in the next room.

23:23.101 --> 23:26.280
I don't think she likes me.

23:26.304 --> 23:28.182
Well, I wouldn't read
too much into it.

23:28.206 --> 23:30.572
Abby sometimes...

23:31.976 --> 23:32.953
One sec.

23:32.977 --> 23:35.309
Need to check something.

23:40.652 --> 23:42.950
I just wouldn't read too much
into it.

23:44.789 --> 23:47.434
Are you guys really
closing in on the killer?

23:47.458 --> 23:48.435
Well, unfortunately,

23:48.459 --> 23:51.605
all of Cooper's internal records
were destroyed in the explosion.

23:51.629 --> 23:54.275
It was likely the point.

23:54.299 --> 23:55.743
What? Something wrong?

23:55.767 --> 23:59.547
Well... what if I told you

23:59.571 --> 24:03.302
not all of the records
were destroyed?

24:04.809 --> 24:06.554
Well, then,
I'd ask you to explain.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.957
Um, you know, I took copies
of polygraph interviews

24:09.981 --> 24:12.159
and background data home.

24:12.183 --> 24:14.595
I know it was a serious breach
of protocol.

24:14.619 --> 24:15.596
Then why'd you do it?

24:15.620 --> 24:17.398
I was studying the data,

24:17.422 --> 24:20.067
hoping to improve
my people-reading skills.

24:20.091 --> 24:22.670
I'm really good
at what I do, Tim.

24:22.694 --> 24:26.373
I can read anyone
like a book with my machines.

24:26.397 --> 24:28.943
When it comes to doing it
blind... ugh...

24:28.967 --> 24:30.744
I'm, you know, blind.

24:30.768 --> 24:33.848
It's probably why I've had such
bad luck with men.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.149
I was actually voted.

24:35.173 --> 24:37.418
"Least Likely to Take a Hint"
in high school.

24:37.442 --> 24:38.686
Really? I can't imagine.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.788
Listen... the data
that you have at your house...

24:40.812 --> 24:41.956
it's important evidence.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.557
We need to go get it now.

24:43.581 --> 24:44.758
Oh, we don't have to.

24:44.782 --> 24:46.393
Actually,
it's on my desktop computer.

24:46.417 --> 24:48.729
We can tunnel in from here.
All we need...

24:48.753 --> 24:50.364
An open port
through our firewall

24:50.388 --> 24:51.799
and an external IP address.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.367
I'm already locked and loaded.

24:53.391 --> 24:57.191
I just need
your log-in information.

24:59.397 --> 25:03.277
So, um, the interviews
are digitized by date,

25:03.301 --> 25:05.946
but, um...
Whoa! What's going on?

25:05.970 --> 25:07.248
Abby, you're not mirroring this

25:07.272 --> 25:08.349
in the other room, are you?

25:08.373 --> 25:09.416
This is not me.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.285
Someone else is accessing
my files.

25:11.309 --> 25:13.554
- Do you have a Webcam?
- Yeah.

25:13.578 --> 25:15.910
All right. Remote-activating it.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.926
Oh, my God!

25:18.950 --> 25:20.440
Someone's in my house.

25:21.819 --> 25:23.650
Try and block access here.

25:29.227 --> 25:31.422
He's taking the computer, McGee.

25:39.535 --> 25:42.181
Abby's working on enhancing
the image, but I wouldn't

25:42.206 --> 25:43.917
- hold your breath.
- Whoever was after Susan,

25:43.941 --> 25:45.752
they disappeared
before we got there.

25:45.776 --> 25:48.121
The door was forced,
and the place was ransacked.

25:48.145 --> 25:49.656
You said you were still able

25:49.680 --> 25:51.124
to download some of the data?

25:51.148 --> 25:52.659
Managed to capture a portion

25:52.683 --> 25:54.294
of Cooper's client directory,

25:54.318 --> 25:56.996
but was unable to get
any actual polygraph files.

25:57.020 --> 26:00.233
We're reconstructing
what we have, but it's not much.

26:00.257 --> 26:01.501
Witnesses?

26:01.525 --> 26:03.203
Well, the neighbor did report

26:03.227 --> 26:05.038
seeing someone lurking,

26:05.062 --> 26:07.140
uh, but couldn't give
a useful description.

26:07.164 --> 26:10.410
Said the suspect seemed
to be waiting for Susan.

26:10.434 --> 26:12.112
Eventually got tired of waiting.

26:12.136 --> 26:14.147
Susan have any idea who?

26:14.171 --> 26:15.248
No.

26:15.272 --> 26:16.416
Come on.
She's the sole survivor.

26:16.440 --> 26:17.717
She must know something.

26:17.741 --> 26:19.219
Well, if she does,
she doesn't know what it is.

26:19.243 --> 26:20.687
Trust me. I spent half
the night up with her.

26:20.711 --> 26:22.288
Well, we know one thing.

26:22.312 --> 26:23.456
Whatever she knows...

26:23.480 --> 26:25.825
It was worth killing for.

26:25.849 --> 26:27.393
Yeah, Abbs. What do you got?

26:27.417 --> 26:29.963
The missing employee
was Gus Templeton, the janitor.

26:29.987 --> 26:31.998
Nice work.

26:32.022 --> 26:34.801
Abby's got an I.D.
on the missing employee.

26:34.825 --> 26:37.203
Gus Templeton. The janitor?

26:37.227 --> 26:39.639
Why was he not at work
during the explosion?

26:39.663 --> 26:40.874
I don't know. Find out.

26:40.898 --> 26:42.742
I've got to update

26:42.766 --> 26:44.427
all the interested parties.

26:48.138 --> 26:50.483
Boss, can I go with Tony,
instead of Ziva?

26:50.507 --> 26:52.852
I'm sorry, it's just,
I've been here all night.

26:52.876 --> 26:54.935
I got... I'm fighting
the cabin fever.

27:00.617 --> 27:02.428
Go on, get out of here.

27:02.452 --> 27:04.886
Thanks.

27:07.791 --> 27:09.636
Can I give you some lady advice?

27:09.660 --> 27:12.972
I'd rather get a lap dance
from a nun, Tony.

27:12.996 --> 27:14.395
NCIS!

27:15.833 --> 27:18.411
Listen, when Jimmy Palmer's
out-girling you,

27:18.435 --> 27:20.647
trust me, you need my advice.

27:20.671 --> 27:23.016
I think you should give
the girl a chance.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.285
You never have.
Maybe you should.

27:25.309 --> 27:27.353
She's a nice girl.

27:27.377 --> 27:29.923
That's very adult of you.

27:29.947 --> 27:32.225
Hmm. It's not me. It's her.

27:32.249 --> 27:33.226
Something about her.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.761
I can't put my finger on it,

27:34.785 --> 27:36.596
but I think she's got
a really nice butt

27:36.620 --> 27:37.997
underneath those long blouses.

27:38.021 --> 27:39.899
That is more like it.

27:39.923 --> 27:41.914
NCIS!

27:43.727 --> 27:44.938
Gus Templeton?

27:44.962 --> 27:47.040
NCIS. We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

27:47.064 --> 27:48.866
Mind if, uh, we come inside?

27:50.834 --> 27:52.579
Oh, boy.

27:52.603 --> 27:54.681
Actually,
we-we can do this out here.

27:54.705 --> 27:56.416
That's fine.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.418
Uh, where-where were you
last night?

27:58.442 --> 28:00.420
In my bathroom...

28:00.444 --> 28:02.522
throwing up.

28:02.546 --> 28:03.914
Bad sushi.

28:05.315 --> 28:07.217
Been there the last two days.

28:08.585 --> 28:11.731
You hear about the fire
at Cooper's?

28:11.755 --> 28:12.899
I'm the janitor.

28:12.923 --> 28:14.567
If someone wanted
to torch the place,

28:14.591 --> 28:16.903
how would I know
anything about it?

28:16.927 --> 28:19.339
Well, the thing is,
we told the media

28:19.363 --> 28:21.274
to report the fire
as an accident.

28:21.298 --> 28:24.043
Never mentioned arson.

28:24.067 --> 28:27.046
That's the janitor,
but I don't remember him

28:27.070 --> 28:28.681
looking quite so green.

28:28.705 --> 28:30.783
I told-told your agents
I don't know nothin'.

28:30.807 --> 28:32.018
I know that.

28:32.042 --> 28:33.820
I got an issue with it.

28:33.844 --> 28:35.334
What's that?

28:37.281 --> 28:39.259
You're lying.

28:39.283 --> 28:41.285
That's it?

28:42.953 --> 28:44.764
I must have missed something.

28:44.788 --> 28:47.033
There are many subtle tells

28:47.057 --> 28:49.035
to indicate a person is lying.

28:49.059 --> 28:53.640
Eye contact, body positioning,
micro-expressions.

28:53.664 --> 28:57.210
But with Gibbs,
it is all "gut," as you say.

28:57.234 --> 28:59.712
Is he ever wrong?

28:59.736 --> 29:02.204
Not that I remember.

29:04.841 --> 29:06.653
I don't have much of a gut.

29:06.677 --> 29:08.668
I never have.

29:10.147 --> 29:12.125
I actually thought

29:12.149 --> 29:14.160
Tim really liked me,

29:14.184 --> 29:18.131
and he was just
playing hard to get.

29:18.155 --> 29:20.133
Perhaps he is...

29:20.157 --> 29:22.168
and just doesn't know it.

29:22.192 --> 29:25.571
You definitely provoke
a strong response in him.

29:25.595 --> 29:27.740
Yeah. The response to run.

29:27.764 --> 29:30.243
Much less lie
about setting the fire.

29:30.267 --> 29:31.791
Why would I lie?

29:34.805 --> 29:37.550
I got ten reasons right here.

29:37.574 --> 29:40.720
Look at 'em.

29:40.744 --> 29:41.988
'Cause somebody's
going down for this.

29:42.012 --> 29:43.389
Please.

29:43.413 --> 29:45.058
You know what my problem is?

29:45.082 --> 29:48.494
My only suspect
makes 30 grand a year,

29:48.518 --> 29:50.396
and he just spent $40,000

29:50.420 --> 29:51.944
on a damn new fishing boat.

29:52.889 --> 29:55.835
They'll kill me.

29:55.859 --> 29:57.804
They already killed everyone
at Cooper's.

29:57.828 --> 29:59.005
No, you killed 'em.

29:59.029 --> 30:01.074
And that's exactly
what the jury's gonna see.

30:01.098 --> 30:02.963
Look at 'em!

30:14.378 --> 30:15.655
I had some gambling debts.

30:15.679 --> 30:18.424
These guys...
they show up at my place

30:18.448 --> 30:21.127
and...

30:21.151 --> 30:23.483
they agree to wipe it all out.

30:25.522 --> 30:28.013
What'd it cost you?

30:33.463 --> 30:35.842
My access card.

30:35.866 --> 30:40.613
Said they were gonna pose
as computer technicians, and

30:40.637 --> 30:43.616
my I.D. would give them access

30:43.640 --> 30:45.151
to every room.

30:45.175 --> 30:47.720
I don't know what they wanted.

30:47.744 --> 30:49.722
And they didn't say nothing

30:49.746 --> 30:51.724
about killing anyone.

30:51.748 --> 30:55.862
I would never
have helped them otherwise.

30:55.886 --> 30:57.877
I want names.

31:00.757 --> 31:02.802
Lifted prints
from the janitor's place.

31:02.826 --> 31:04.937
This is Peter
and Arnold Rafferty.

31:04.961 --> 31:07.407
Started with petty theft
as teens.

31:07.431 --> 31:09.308
Moved on to boosting cars.

31:09.332 --> 31:11.411
Graduated to muscle
for organized crime.

31:11.435 --> 31:12.779
Familiar?

31:12.803 --> 31:15.314
Those are the guys who came
in to fix the computers.

31:15.338 --> 31:17.650
Probably the ones
that disabled it.

31:17.674 --> 31:19.786
Well, their names
were mentioned 127 times

31:19.810 --> 31:22.588
in Stefano Delmar's testimony.

31:22.612 --> 31:25.224
I'm guessing they found out
where he was hiding

31:25.248 --> 31:26.793
and went and got some payback.

31:26.817 --> 31:29.095
Then broke into my house
to destroy my files.

31:29.119 --> 31:30.630
You have to catch them.

31:30.654 --> 31:32.932
Now. Like, right now.

31:32.956 --> 31:34.467
We're working on it.

31:34.491 --> 31:35.768
We have hit a Shamu.

31:35.792 --> 31:37.670
Does she mean "snafu"?

31:37.694 --> 31:38.671
Roll with it.

31:38.695 --> 31:40.273
We were able to track

31:40.297 --> 31:41.707
the Rafferty brothers'
movements prior to them

31:41.731 --> 31:43.176
destroying Cooper's Hawk
Security.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.244
- Right, then what?
- Nothing.

31:45.268 --> 31:47.046
Fornell and his beard
are running contacts,

31:47.070 --> 31:48.581
but it looks like
they've gone underground.

31:48.605 --> 31:50.516
Must've known an indictment
was coming soon.

31:50.540 --> 31:53.786
Maybe. But I don't think
that's why they disappeared.

31:53.810 --> 31:55.971
Monsieur Gibbs, s'il vous plaît.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.907
There's foulness afoot.

31:59.950 --> 32:01.160
First things first, Gibbs:

32:01.184 --> 32:03.129
The Rafferty brothers
definitely killed Delmar

32:03.153 --> 32:04.831
and the petty officer
that stumbled on them.

32:04.855 --> 32:06.799
I found their DNA
on both victims.

32:06.823 --> 32:09.168
Second, the fire marshal

32:09.192 --> 32:11.137
finally issued his report.

32:11.161 --> 32:12.972
I think he's some sort
of frustrated novelist

32:12.996 --> 32:14.874
or something,
but it's a pretty good read.

32:14.898 --> 32:15.975
Abby?

32:15.999 --> 32:17.009
Yes, Gibbs?

32:17.033 --> 32:18.478
Nutshell.

32:18.502 --> 32:19.946
Yes, Gibbs.

32:19.970 --> 32:22.115
The murder scene
is not the only place

32:22.139 --> 32:23.549
that I found the Raffertys' DNA.

32:23.573 --> 32:26.052
They never made it
out of Cooper's alive.

32:26.076 --> 32:27.620
You said all the bodies
were accounted for.

32:27.644 --> 32:29.322
And... they were.

32:29.346 --> 32:31.357
The fire marshal scraped this

32:31.381 --> 32:33.459
at the source of the explosion.

32:33.483 --> 32:35.394
It's ash, Gibbs.

32:35.418 --> 32:36.796
It's human ash.

32:36.820 --> 32:38.631
The Rafferty brothers
left no bodies,

32:38.655 --> 32:41.067
because they were literally
incinerated by the explosion.

32:41.091 --> 32:43.035
So who broke into Susan's house?

32:43.059 --> 32:44.303
Oh, it gets better.

32:44.327 --> 32:46.539
The fire marshal traced
the source of the explosion

32:46.563 --> 32:48.641
to Cooper's computer room
in the basement.

32:48.665 --> 32:50.910
And the explosive
was very small.

32:50.934 --> 32:52.145
Didn't look small.

32:52.169 --> 32:53.913
But it was.

32:53.937 --> 32:57.049
The explosive was designed
to fry the servers

32:57.073 --> 32:59.719
that were holding computer
records, not to kill anyone.

32:59.743 --> 33:01.654
But the explosion penetrated

33:01.678 --> 33:03.656
the gas main of the building,
and kaboom.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.391
Only the records were targeted?

33:05.415 --> 33:06.959
And I know what you're thinking.

33:06.983 --> 33:09.795
Delmar's testimony ratting out
the Rafferty brothers

33:09.819 --> 33:11.030
is already on record, so?

33:11.054 --> 33:15.013
So, what were they
trying to hide?

33:24.433 --> 33:26.478
They went to
a lot of trouble to destroy.

33:26.502 --> 33:28.180
Cooper's records. Why?

33:28.204 --> 33:30.148
Not to cover their connection
to Delmar.

33:30.172 --> 33:31.917
His testimony's
already on record.

33:31.941 --> 33:33.618
What else was
in those computers?

33:33.642 --> 33:37.122
Just spoke with the company
that handles Cooper's I.T.

33:37.146 --> 33:39.090
The server that they
specifically downloaded

33:39.114 --> 33:41.981
houses Cooper's polygraph files.

33:46.322 --> 33:47.732
What?

33:47.756 --> 33:49.634
What was in those files?

33:49.658 --> 33:52.537
Um, well, um...

33:52.561 --> 33:55.140
audio recordings
of the polygraph examinees.

33:55.164 --> 33:57.175
Um, their physiological data,

33:57.199 --> 33:58.843
post-test analysis...

33:58.867 --> 34:00.912
Questions, answers.

34:00.936 --> 34:02.747
Wavy lines next to them.

34:02.771 --> 34:05.483
Questions, you know,
involving each case, yeah,

34:05.507 --> 34:07.385
and the standard ones
we start with.

34:07.409 --> 34:08.920
Y-You've pretty much
heard them already.

34:08.944 --> 34:11.469
They're almost identical
to the ones we do here.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.543
Agent Gibbs has never taken
a polygraph exam.

34:18.587 --> 34:19.884
Ever?

34:21.657 --> 34:23.123
This won't hurt a bit.

34:27.228 --> 34:29.474
Wouldn't miss this
for the world, huh?

34:29.498 --> 34:31.762
He's been dodging this
for years.

34:32.967 --> 34:35.280
Um...

34:35.304 --> 34:37.864
if you could just
make some room.

34:41.710 --> 34:44.022
Where are you thinking
of clipping that thing?

34:44.045 --> 34:47.192
It's for the sphincter sensor.

34:47.216 --> 34:49.051
Oh, gee...

34:50.953 --> 34:54.980
I, uh, usually
set this up beforehand.

35:01.997 --> 35:04.643
All you need now is a buzzer.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.177
Oh, no, nothing like that.

35:06.201 --> 35:08.135
That'd make the testee
too nervous.

35:12.241 --> 35:15.335
All right, let's begin.

35:22.318 --> 35:25.014
Is your name Leroy Jethro Gibbs?

35:26.021 --> 35:27.318
Yes.

35:29.692 --> 35:32.270
Were you born
in Stillwater, Pennsylvania?

35:32.294 --> 35:33.886
Yes.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.909
Have you ever stolen

35:37.933 --> 35:40.278
more than a hundred dollars
in cash or property

35:40.302 --> 35:42.614
- from an employer?
- No.

35:42.638 --> 35:44.916
That one gets me every time.

35:44.940 --> 35:46.818
Have you ever committed
espionage

35:46.842 --> 35:48.553
for a foreign country?

35:48.577 --> 35:49.942
No.

35:51.213 --> 35:54.893
Have you ever divulged
classified information?

35:54.917 --> 35:56.394
No.

35:56.418 --> 35:59.478
Have you ever
committed a felony?

36:08.430 --> 36:09.607
Agent Gibbs?

36:09.631 --> 36:11.394
Could you answer
the question, please?

36:17.740 --> 36:18.740
That's enough.

36:19.842 --> 36:21.241
Something wrong, Agent Gibbs?

36:22.945 --> 36:24.956
What happens if you fail?

36:24.980 --> 36:27.525
At NCIS, you lose
your security clearance.

36:27.549 --> 36:29.928
- Usually your job.
- Same at FBI.

36:29.952 --> 36:32.430
The CEO of Cooper's
Hawk was pushing for its

36:32.454 --> 36:34.699
use in more areas
of federal employment.

36:34.723 --> 36:36.835
He even convinced several
congressional committees to give

36:36.859 --> 36:38.036
them a test run.

36:38.060 --> 36:39.537
I finally decoded
the data fragment

36:39.561 --> 36:40.805
that McGee
pulled from the computer.

36:40.829 --> 36:42.774
It's a list
of the past year's clients.

36:42.798 --> 36:44.275
It's a veritable who's who

36:44.299 --> 36:45.766
of senate confirmation
appointees.

36:50.472 --> 36:52.817
Well, how about that?

36:52.841 --> 36:54.331
Thanks, Craig.

36:57.413 --> 36:58.890
Boys.

36:58.914 --> 37:01.906
I didn't realize we were making
this a regular thing.

37:03.218 --> 37:04.863
You were a Cooper's client.

37:04.887 --> 37:07.098
Skipping the small talk?

37:07.122 --> 37:09.647
We need an explanation,
Your Honor.

37:11.093 --> 37:12.537
Wow, this is the big leagues.

37:12.561 --> 37:14.586
Judge?

37:15.931 --> 37:19.077
Two years ago,
I sat on a circuit court bench

37:19.101 --> 37:20.745
in a small town in Illinois

37:20.769 --> 37:23.782
when I was hand-picked
for a federal spot.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.450
Do you know how much combing

37:25.474 --> 37:29.387
and sifting takes place during
judicial confirmation hearings?

37:29.411 --> 37:31.055
I wanted to make sure
nothing embarrassing

37:31.079 --> 37:33.425
would surface before
I accepted the nomination.

37:33.449 --> 37:34.592
Personally embarrassing?

37:34.616 --> 37:35.927
Maybe.

37:35.951 --> 37:38.044
You want someone digging
up your skeletons?

37:39.822 --> 37:42.552
So, that's why you went to them?

37:43.592 --> 37:44.869
As a dry run.

37:44.893 --> 37:47.539
Take a dry run
at that polygraph machine?

37:47.563 --> 37:49.374
Learn how to beat it?

37:49.398 --> 37:50.809
To get accustomed to it.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.544
I had never taken one before.

37:52.568 --> 37:54.045
The committee was

37:54.069 --> 37:55.380
just experimenting
with polygraphs

37:55.404 --> 37:56.881
as part of the vetting.

37:56.905 --> 38:00.552
And my nervousness could have
derailed the confirmation.

38:00.576 --> 38:02.387
Not nervous around
the machine anymore?

38:02.411 --> 38:05.123
Nope.

38:05.147 --> 38:06.791
Good.

38:06.815 --> 38:08.646
Then you won't mind
taking another one.

38:11.086 --> 38:12.730
What exactly do you think
she knows?

38:12.754 --> 38:14.688
With her clearance level?

38:15.724 --> 38:17.101
Everything.

38:17.125 --> 38:18.670
Can't just accuse
a sitting judge

38:18.694 --> 38:20.605
of being a part of a criminal
conspiracy, Gibbs.

38:20.629 --> 38:23.189
I'm just going to ask
her a few questions, Leon.

38:25.067 --> 38:27.278
As a judge
in Skokie County, Illinois,

38:27.302 --> 38:30.014
did you preside over the case
of People v. Perkins?

38:30.038 --> 38:32.250
- Yes.
- The outcome was Perkins'

38:32.274 --> 38:34.285
conviction on three counts
of murder?

38:34.309 --> 38:36.174
Yes, you have the file.

38:42.117 --> 38:45.712
After the trial, primary witness
against Perkins went missing.

38:47.022 --> 38:48.233
You know what happened to him?

38:48.257 --> 38:49.958
No.

38:53.729 --> 38:55.130
Oh, yeah.

38:56.498 --> 38:57.909
Sorry about that.
I forgot to mention

38:57.933 --> 38:59.744
I had one of my agents, uh,

38:59.768 --> 39:01.837
rig up all
the bells and whistles.

39:04.239 --> 39:07.174
FBI never found the witness.

39:08.810 --> 39:10.788
Similar to the missing witnesses

39:10.812 --> 39:12.891
in the recent string
of RICO cases.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.960
Hmm, last one ended up
in your court.

39:15.984 --> 39:17.829
Stefano Delmar

39:17.853 --> 39:20.098
was granted immunity
after confessing

39:20.122 --> 39:22.867
to multiple murders.

39:22.891 --> 39:24.536
You know what happened to him?

39:24.560 --> 39:26.551
Yes.

39:27.930 --> 39:30.909
Can you tolerate
watching bad guys walk,

39:30.933 --> 39:34.603
because their testimony
convicts even worse guys?

39:38.440 --> 39:40.118
Is that what you call

39:40.142 --> 39:43.087
the "occasional inequities
of the system"?

39:43.111 --> 39:45.290
Did you leak
identities of protected

39:45.314 --> 39:48.951
witnesses to people
who had grudges against them?

39:50.953 --> 39:53.431
Did you use Cooper
to become a better liar

39:53.455 --> 39:56.825
in order to mete out vigilante
justice from a higher bench?

40:00.462 --> 40:03.274
Y-You accuse me of what?

40:03.298 --> 40:07.478
Of targeting rats
who bail out of a sinking ship?

40:07.502 --> 40:11.097
Without a shred
of admissible evidence...

40:12.474 --> 40:13.668
I'll have your badges.

40:20.949 --> 40:22.994
She is right.

40:23.018 --> 40:24.429
Was murder by proxy.

40:24.453 --> 40:26.431
Oh, yeah.

40:26.455 --> 40:29.133
The Rafferty brothers
did her dirty work.

40:29.157 --> 40:32.503
Their little mistake
took out more than she intended,

40:32.527 --> 40:34.772
but it also means

40:34.796 --> 40:38.543
that everyone connected
with those murders is dead.

40:38.567 --> 40:40.545
Yeah.

40:40.569 --> 40:42.847
No evidence she was involved
in any crime.

40:42.871 --> 40:43.848
No.

40:43.872 --> 40:45.216
Just the break-in.

40:45.240 --> 40:46.551
Oh, right.

40:46.575 --> 40:49.621
That was the first

40:49.645 --> 40:53.057
actual boots-on-the-ground crime

40:53.081 --> 40:54.559
that you committed yourself.

40:54.583 --> 40:57.195
Did the Raffertys
alert you that those

40:57.219 --> 40:58.563
files were copied?

40:58.587 --> 41:00.832
Or did you just lift that
from my own update?

41:00.856 --> 41:02.934
Very few people
had that information.

41:02.958 --> 41:05.003
You really think
you're such a natural

41:05.027 --> 41:06.704
that you didn't leave behind

41:06.728 --> 41:09.607
a single red hair?

41:09.631 --> 41:12.243
You never faced your victims,

41:12.267 --> 41:14.412
but you still murdered them.

41:14.436 --> 41:15.680
You know, it doesn't matter

41:15.704 --> 41:17.115
that you think
they had it coming.

41:17.139 --> 41:19.817
You were appointed judge.

41:19.841 --> 41:22.139
Not jury and executioner.

41:27.149 --> 41:29.360
We did find a hair
at your place.

41:29.384 --> 41:30.795
There might have been a red one.

41:30.819 --> 41:33.831
So, was he bluffing or not?
I just couldn't tell.

41:33.855 --> 41:36.067
Hey, Susan,
start in the shallow end.

41:36.091 --> 41:38.727
Reading Gibbs' mind is...
well, it's like re...

41:41.329 --> 41:44.609
Dear God...
someone fed him after midnight.

41:44.633 --> 41:46.177
Jimmy, what happened to you?

41:46.201 --> 41:49.047
Oh... turns out I am really
allergic to henna.

41:49.071 --> 41:50.381
But, uh...

41:50.405 --> 41:51.983
I can't reach back there,
so-so do you think

41:52.007 --> 41:53.651
- you guys could?
- I'm late for a squash game.

41:53.675 --> 41:55.486
- I'm sorry, I gotta get the hell out of here.
- Please, guys,

41:55.510 --> 41:57.488
- it really itches!
- That's what girlfriends are for. Hi.

41:57.512 --> 41:58.956
- Okay, I can get the top part...
- Stay, stay, stay! Stay!

41:58.980 --> 42:01.693
No, please, do not... It may be,
actually, very conta... I may

42:01.717 --> 42:03.061
- I need help. - Have to hurt you massively.
- She'll do it.

42:03.085 --> 42:04.328
- She'll do it.
- I may have to hurt you.

42:04.352 --> 42:05.697
- She'll do it.
- I would do it for you! I would do it for you!

42:05.721 --> 42:07.081
- No, you wouldn't!
- Yes, I would!

42:08.156 --> 42:09.834
Susan, you want
to get some dinner?

42:09.858 --> 42:12.737
You're asking me to dinner?

42:12.761 --> 42:14.338
Yeah.

42:14.362 --> 42:16.641
Yeah, seeing you in action,

42:16.665 --> 42:19.444
you know, you doing
what you do, it's, um...

42:19.468 --> 42:21.379
It's interesting to me.
I'd like to know more.

42:21.403 --> 42:22.714
You would?

42:22.738 --> 42:24.239
Yes, I would.

42:26.408 --> 42:27.885
Yeah, but, um,

42:27.909 --> 42:29.774
I don't think you really would.

42:32.781 --> 42:35.716
But it's-it's sweet of you
to say.

42:39.654 --> 42:43.000
Uh, no, I-I actually would.

42:43.024 --> 42:45.203
I really would.

42:45.227 --> 42:47.004
Hey!

42:47.028 --> 42:48.427
I would!
