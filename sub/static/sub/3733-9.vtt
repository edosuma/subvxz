00:02.300 --> 00:05.326
- (man): The novelty
of Hannibal Lecter has waned.

00:05.370 --> 00:08.294
This fellow, there is something
so universal about what he does.

00:08.340 --> 00:09.762
- This freak is in phase
with the moon.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.869
We might have a little more
than three weeks before
he does it again.

00:11.910 --> 00:16.370
- (Will): I don't think about
this anymore. I don't think
I can be any use to you, Jack.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.105
- (Jack): Is there an opinion
that you want, Will?

00:18.150 --> 00:20.414
- (Will): I have
to see Hannibal.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.057
(Lecter sniffing)

00:33.100 --> 00:36.126
- That's the same atrocious
aftershave you wore In court.

00:43.670 --> 00:46.104
- Hello, Dr. Lecter.

00:46.140 --> 00:49.371
- Hello, Will.

00:49.410 --> 00:51.378
Did you get my note?

00:51.410 --> 00:53.514
- I got it. Thank you.

00:53.550 --> 00:56.087
- Did you read it
before you destroyed it?

00:56.120 --> 00:59.157
Or did you simply toss it
into the nearest fire?

00:59.190 --> 01:01.112
- I read it...

01:01.160 --> 01:04.254
and then I burnt it.

01:04.290 --> 01:07.259
- And you came anyway.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.395
I'm glad you came.

01:14.440 --> 01:18.137
My other callers
are all... professional.

01:18.170 --> 01:22.641
Banal psychiatrists
and grasping second-raters.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.706
Pencil lickers.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.445
- I want you to help me,
Dr. Lecter.

01:30.490 --> 01:33.118
- Yes, I thought so.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.156
Are we no longer
on a first-name basis?

01:38.190 --> 01:40.294
- I'm more comfortable

01:40.330 --> 01:42.469
the less personal we are.

01:47.670 --> 01:50.230
(Lecter sniffing)

01:50.270 --> 01:53.433
- I smell dogs...

01:53.480 --> 01:57.348
and pine and oil
beneath that shaving lotion.

01:59.350 --> 02:02.239
It's something a child
would select, isn't it?

02:02.290 --> 02:05.441
Is there a child
in your life, Will?

02:05.490 --> 02:08.618
I gave you a chance
if you recall.

02:14.630 --> 02:18.828
- I came about
Chicago and Buffalo.

02:18.870 --> 02:21.191
You've read about it.
- I've read the papers.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.209
I can't clip them.
They won't let me have scissors.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.470
Of course.

02:26.510 --> 02:29.274
You want to know
how he's choosing them?

02:29.310 --> 02:32.518
- Thought you would
have some ideas.

02:36.550 --> 02:40.486
- You just came here
to look at me.

02:40.520 --> 02:45.219
Came to get the old scent again.
(Hannibal sniffing)

02:45.260 --> 02:47.296
Why don't you just
smell yourself?

02:47.330 --> 02:49.195
- Uh...

02:51.530 --> 02:53.964
I expected more
of you, Doctor.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.336
That routine... is old hat.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.304
- Whereas you are a new man.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.671
Are you a good father, Will?

03:09.520 --> 03:11.943
Let me have the file.

03:11.990 --> 03:15.812
An hour, and we can
discuss it like old times.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.821
- Thank you.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.566
- Family values may have
declined over the last century,

03:30.610 --> 03:33.306
but we still help
our families when we can.

03:35.310 --> 03:37.778
You're family, Will.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.619
- How many people
have you killed?

03:58.930 --> 04:01.398
- Many more than your father.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.831
- Are you going to kill me?

04:09.810 --> 04:12.415
- I'm so sorry, Abigail.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.740
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you
in this life.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.293
Blood rituals involve
a symbolic death,

04:28.330 --> 04:31.561
and then a rebirth.

04:31.600 --> 04:34.433
As with all things
in the natural world,

04:34.470 --> 04:37.507
you'll adapt now
and mutate later.

04:37.540 --> 04:40.509
- Evolve or die.

04:40.540 --> 04:43.008
- Even if you know the state
of who you are today,

04:43.050 --> 04:45.006
you can't predict
who you'll be tomorrow.

04:45.050 --> 04:48.019
You're defined up to now,
not beyond.

04:50.550 --> 04:54.008
- How would you have done it...

04:54.060 --> 04:56.449
if you were going to do it?

04:56.490 --> 04:58.481
- How would I have
murdered you?

05:00.030 --> 05:04.296
I would have cut your throat
like your father did.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.966
- But you're not my father.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.629
- You accepted your father...

05:11.670 --> 05:14.377
would it be
so difficult to accept me?

05:14.410 --> 05:17.777
- I don't know
if it would be smart.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.385
- We don't get wiser
as we get older, Abigail,

05:23.420 --> 05:25.388
but we do learn to avoid

05:25.420 --> 05:29.117
or raise a certain amount
of hell,

05:29.160 --> 05:31.424
depending on which we prefer.

05:35.030 --> 05:37.066
I'll need to collect some flesh.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.069
Not a pound, only a piece.

05:40.100 --> 05:42.364
Something you can
live without.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.664
- You mean, like a finger?
- I couldn't bear

05:45.710 --> 05:48.372
to take your fingers,
not even one.

05:48.410 --> 05:51.072
They're so lovely.

05:51.110 --> 05:53.647
And I was hoping to teach you

05:53.680 --> 05:55.739
how to play the harpsichord.

06:00.590 --> 06:03.127
That's enough for now.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.422
This will approximate
the amount of pressure.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.860
Blood leaves the body
at a gallop and then a stumble.

06:19.910 --> 06:22.549
Are you ready
to die, Abigail?

06:24.750 --> 06:26.945
- Yes.

06:26.980 --> 06:31.110
Can I push the button?

06:31.150 --> 06:34.608
- Yes.

07:05.650 --> 07:08.687
(Abigail sighing)

07:08.720 --> 07:10.927
Abigail Hobbs is dead.

07:12.930 --> 07:14.921
- Long live Abigail Hobbs.

07:18.670 --> 07:21.935
(theme music)

07:43.790 --> 07:47.851
- It's good to see you
looking so well, Will.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.619
But I can't help wishing
you weren't here.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.797
- Wishing and hoping.

07:54.670 --> 07:57.935
- How did it feel
to see him again?

08:00.940 --> 08:04.944
(sigh)
- Like...

08:04.980 --> 08:07.972
Hannibal was looking through
to the back of my skull.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.719
Felt like a fly

08:11.750 --> 08:14.150
flitting around
back there.

08:14.190 --> 08:16.556
I had the absurd feeling

08:16.590 --> 08:18.558
that he walked out with me.

08:18.590 --> 08:21.093
Had to stop outside the doors,

08:21.130 --> 08:24.122
look around,
make sure I was alone.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.536
- I know that feeling.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.861
Well, at least,
Jack Crawford is pleased.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.798
(Will chuckling)

08:32.840 --> 08:36.606
- He showed me
pictures of the families.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.813
I looked at Molly and Walter,
and I couldn't say no.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.909
- And Jack was counting on it.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.925
(Will sighing)
- Haha!

08:55.060 --> 08:57.119
Still with Margot?

08:57.170 --> 08:59.638
- Yes.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.036
We have a baby.

09:02.070 --> 09:04.129
A Verger baby.
- Haha!

09:04.170 --> 09:06.138
A son.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.604
- Oh... good for Margot.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.346
- Good for me. I carried him.

09:10.380 --> 09:13.269
He's my son.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.641
He's the Verger heir.

09:18.220 --> 09:21.951
- So... what are you
doing here?

09:21.990 --> 09:24.584
- There are only five doors
between Hannibal

09:24.630 --> 09:26.791
and the outside...

09:26.830 --> 09:28.855
and I have the keys
to all of them.

09:28.900 --> 09:33.064
Hannibal's never been...

09:33.100 --> 09:35.739
great with boundaries.

09:35.770 --> 09:39.638
"He who sups with the Devil
needs a long spoon."

09:45.080 --> 09:47.969
- I'm not letting him in, Alana.

09:50.950 --> 09:53.214
Don't worry about me.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.583
- Last time,
it didn't end with you.

10:13.740 --> 10:16.208
(Lecter sniffing)

10:16.240 --> 10:18.777
- This is a very shy boy, Will.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.778
I would love to meet him.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.209
- I'm sure you would.

10:23.250 --> 10:26.242
- Have you considered
the possibility that
he's disfigured?

10:26.290 --> 10:29.054
Or that he may believe
he's disfigured?

10:29.090 --> 10:31.058
- That's interesting.

10:31.090 --> 10:33.820
- That's not interesting.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.288
You thought of that before.
- He smashed

10:39.330 --> 10:41.833
all the mirrors in the houses,
not just enough

10:41.870 --> 10:44.907
to get the pieces he wanted.

10:44.940 --> 10:47.738
These shards are set
so he can see himself

10:47.780 --> 10:50.044
in their eyes.

10:51.910 --> 10:55.243
- Could you see yourself
in their eyes, Will?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.248
Killing them all?

11:07.360 --> 11:10.193
The first small bond
to the killer

11:10.230 --> 11:13.358
itches and stings like a leech.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.343
Like you, Will...

11:25.380 --> 11:28.679
he needs a family
to escape what's inside him.

11:39.230 --> 11:42.961
You know a fair amount
about how these families died.

11:45.030 --> 11:48.488
How they lived is
how he chooses them.

11:48.540 --> 11:50.735
- How is he choosing them?

11:52.510 --> 11:54.774
- How did you choose yours?

11:56.380 --> 12:00.271
Ready-made wife and child
to serve your needs.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.914
A stepson or daughter...

12:04.890 --> 12:08.280
A stepson absolves you
of any biological blame.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.249
You know better than to breed.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.997
Can't pass on those terrible
traits you fear the most.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.835
Why are there no descriptions
of the grounds?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.836
I see floor plans,

12:28.880 --> 12:33.169
diagrams of the rooms
where death occurred.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.472
What were the yards like?

12:37.290 --> 12:39.246
- Big...

12:39.290 --> 12:42.453
fenced, with trees. Why?

12:42.490 --> 12:45.379
- If this pilgrim feels
a special relationship

12:45.430 --> 12:48.422
with the moon, he might like
to go outside and look at it,

12:48.460 --> 12:52.829
before he tidies himself up.

12:52.870 --> 12:54.929
If one were nude, say,

12:54.970 --> 12:57.131
it would be better
to have outdoor privacy

12:57.170 --> 12:59.206
for that sort of thing.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.172
One must show some consideration
for the neighbours.

13:07.450 --> 13:10.510
Have you ever seen blood
in the moonlight, Will?

13:13.190 --> 13:16.182
It appears quite black.

13:43.650 --> 13:46.448
(camera clicking)

14:08.440 --> 14:12.149
You've come to wag
your finger?

14:12.180 --> 14:14.216
- I love
a good finger-wagging.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.468
- Yes, you do.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.511
How is Margot?

14:21.520 --> 14:26.082
- Your cogs
are turning, Hannibal.

14:26.130 --> 14:28.928
I can hear them clicking.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.326
- (softly): Click, click, boom.

14:33.300 --> 14:37.202
- I don't know what you're
planning with Will Graham,

14:37.240 --> 14:40.676
butyouTe
planning something.

14:40.710 --> 14:43.178
Why wouldn't you be?

14:43.210 --> 14:45.974
You've already
cracked the lid,

14:46.010 --> 14:48.410
can't resist
peeling it back.

14:50.450 --> 14:52.918
- Will came to me.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.916
- Yes, he did.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.679
- I advised him against it.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.948
- I'm sure.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.928
- Are you suggesting I don't
have Will's best interests

15:03.970 --> 15:05.995
in my mind?

15:08.500 --> 15:11.298
- I'm stating it as fact.

15:13.540 --> 15:16.577
- You've got Will dressed up
in moral-dignity pants...

15:19.010 --> 15:21.570
...nothing is his fault.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.512
- I've been courteous...

15:28.560 --> 15:31.188
and you have been
receptive to courtesy.

15:33.230 --> 15:37.018
But these _n_iceties
are condItIonal,

15:37.070 --> 15:39.994
and the conditions
are non-negotiable.

15:46.540 --> 15:49.304
- I must behave myself.

15:51.310 --> 15:53.471
- I know what
you're afraid of.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.347
It's not pain or solitude.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.383
It's indignity.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.194
You're a little bit
like a cat that way.

16:10.330 --> 16:13.766
I'll take your books.

16:13.800 --> 16:17.167
I'll take your drawings.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.599
I'll take your toilet.

16:27.380 --> 16:30.417
You'll have nothing
but indignity...

16:33.090 --> 16:35.752
...and the company
of the dead.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.737
- We have a basic affinity
for our family.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.719
We can detect each other
from smell alone.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.744
You recognize this?

17:06.790 --> 17:09.384
- My father made it...

17:09.420 --> 17:11.422
out of bone.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.690
- Your father never wished
for anything but your happiness.

17:18.700 --> 17:20.668
- My father cut my throat.

17:20.700 --> 17:23.760
- Out of love.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.132
- That wasn't love.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.240
- Every family
loves differently.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.248
Every love is unique.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.445
You deny your love
for your father

17:36.480 --> 17:38.744
_ _because of what
It might mean about you.

17:38.790 --> 17:41.850
Can you smell him
here, Abigail?

17:41.890 --> 17:44.154
(Abigail sniffing)

17:46.160 --> 17:49.049
- Yes.

17:59.340 --> 18:01.308
- This is
what your father is.

18:01.340 --> 18:03.308
This is all of him now.

18:03.350 --> 18:06.478
This is what death
has reduced him to.

18:11.150 --> 18:14.210
All that's left is honesty.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.358
Can you be honest
with me now?

18:24.670 --> 18:27.696
- He was as good to me
as he knew how to be.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.668
Hunting with him
was the best time

18:31.710 --> 18:35.168
I ever had.
- Yes.

18:35.210 --> 18:37.201
A fine definition of love.

18:39.850 --> 18:43.513
You have to allow yourself to
love him the way he loved you.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.942
- What you need
of your father is here,

19:11.980 --> 19:14.210
in your head...
(Abigail shivering)

19:14.250 --> 19:16.718
...and subject to
your judgment, not his.

19:18.790 --> 19:22.248
(Abigail shivering)

19:22.290 --> 19:24.758
Never be ashamed
of who you are, Abigail.

22:19.030 --> 22:21.760
- Found it
behind the Jacobis' garage.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.007
Flower between its paws,
wrapped in a dish towel,

22:24.040 --> 22:27.430
strangled.
- Son of a bitch.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.129
- OK... Seems like
you're more upset

22:29.180 --> 22:31.444
about the cat than you were
about the children, but...

22:31.480 --> 22:33.368
- I'm particularly
fond of cats;

22:33.420 --> 22:35.376
I'm not particularly
fond of children.

22:35.420 --> 22:38.389
- What about the Leeds' dog?
- It was punctured
in the abdomen.

22:38.420 --> 22:41.878
Vet worked on him. He should be
OK. They thought he was shot,
but they didn't find a bullet.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.582
They thought he was stabbed
with an ice pick or an awl.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.724
- The son of a bitch.
- So now he feels compelled

22:47.760 --> 22:50.058
to hurt the victims' pets before
he comes to kill the family?

22:50.100 --> 22:52.819
- It eliminates
an early-warning system.

22:52.870 --> 22:55.031
Case the place,
kill the pet,

22:55.070 --> 22:56.890
then the family.

22:56.940 --> 22:59.158
- We should send
a private bulletin

22:59.210 --> 23:01.531
to veterinarians
and anImal shelters,

23:01.580 --> 23:03.548
asking for immediate report

23:03.580 --> 23:05.707
of animal mutilation.
- Chicago and Buffalo

23:05.750 --> 23:09.470
are four states apart;
nothing's been found to
link these two families.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.488
What do they have in common?

23:11.520 --> 23:13.511
- They were both happy.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.744
(clanging)

24:23.630 --> 24:26.155
I sat here,

24:26.190 --> 24:28.192
and I watched them.

24:35.170 --> 24:37.161
- Now, are you just keeping

24:37.200 --> 24:39.668
America clean
or IS that evrdence?

24:41.580 --> 24:43.741
- You're trespassing, Freddie.
- I was trespassing

24:46.150 --> 24:49.176
- I'm not talking to you.
- We're coconspirators, Will.

24:49.220 --> 24:51.939
I died for you and your cause.
- You didn't die enough.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.914
You came into my hospital room
while I was sleeping,

24:54.960 --> 24:57.053
flipped back the covers
and snapped a photo

24:57.090 --> 24:59.058
of my temporary colostomy bag.

24:59.090 --> 25:01.058
- Covered your junk
with a black box.

25:01.100 --> 25:04.524
A big black box.
You're welcome.

25:04.570 --> 25:07.994
- You called us murder husbands.
- You did run off to
Europe together.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.804
How does the Tooth Fairy compare
with Hannibal Lecter?

25:10.840 --> 25:14.071
Haven't seen anything like this
since the Massacre
at Muskrat Farm.

25:14.110 --> 25:16.203
Funny thing about
that massacre:

25:16.240 --> 25:19.107
not only did Dr. Bloom survive,
she got rich.

25:19.150 --> 25:21.618
Lecter's living in the lab
under her care.

25:21.650 --> 25:23.811
What kind of arrangement
do you suppose they have?

25:23.850 --> 25:26.080
- Complicated arrangement.

25:26.120 --> 25:28.611
- Couldn't be more complicated

25:28.660 --> 25:30.628
than your relationship
with Hannibal.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.628
You paid him a visit?

25:32.660 --> 25:34.218
Before you lie,
know that I know you did.

25:34.260 --> 25:36.854
_ Goodbye, Freddie.
_ "Federal manhunters,

25:36.900 --> 25:38.868
"stymied in their search
for the Tooth Fairy,

25:38.900 --> 25:41.994
"have turned to the most savage
killer in captivity for help.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.065
"'It takes one to catch one,'

25:44.110 --> 25:47.204
a federal official
told this reporter."

25:47.240 --> 25:49.800
- "Takes one to catch one"?

25:49.840 --> 25:52.172
You're referring
to Hannibal Lecter or me?

25:52.210 --> 25:55.668
- I'll let my readers decide.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.745
If you're smart, you'd use me.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.088
All psychopaths
are narcissists;

26:00.120 --> 26:03.089
they love to read
about themselves.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.265
(knocking on door)

26:52.310 --> 26:55.905
- Come on in.
(shuffling)

26:55.940 --> 26:58.204
(door opening)

27:10.160 --> 27:12.128
- I'm Francis...

27:12.160 --> 27:14.128
Dolarhyde.
- Same Mr. D

27:14.160 --> 27:17.766
who send_s_t_he rockets
when the reqUISItIons are wrong?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.768
- The very one.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.768
- Put your back
against the door.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.768
Come forward three steps
until you feel

27:23.810 --> 27:25.937
the tile under your feet.
There'll be a stool

27:25.970 --> 27:29.872
on your right. I'll just put
this stuff in the black hole.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.259
- I was gonna...

27:54.970 --> 27:58.269
Do you think
I could have a plum?

27:58.310 --> 28:01.802
- Sure. They're really good.

28:19.190 --> 28:21.795
- I need to ask a favour.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.889
- In addition to the plum?

28:23.930 --> 28:26.467
- In addition
to the plum.

28:28.470 --> 28:31.200
I need... some...

28:31.240 --> 28:35.279
infrared movie film.

28:36.980 --> 28:38.777
Hot,

28:38.810 --> 28:41.973
sensitive up around...

28:42.020 --> 28:43.988
one thousand nanometers.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.988
- Better off
shooting digital.

28:46.020 --> 28:48.250
- Oh, I'm not a fan
of that format.

28:48.290 --> 28:50.258
- Nobody around here is.

28:50.290 --> 28:53.327
- I'm shooting at...

28:53.360 --> 28:56.329
maybe...

28:56.360 --> 28:58.328
eight feet.

28:58.370 --> 29:02.090
I wanna photograph
the nocturnal animals

29:02.140 --> 29:04.131
at the zoo.

29:04.170 --> 29:06.138
- The more sensitive
the film,

29:06.170 --> 29:08.877
the meaner it is to handle.

29:08.910 --> 29:11.549
You get in the coolers,
dry ice, all that.

29:11.580 --> 29:13.548
Do you plan
to process it yourself?

29:13.580 --> 29:16.014
- Uh-huh.
- Got to be total darkness.

29:16.050 --> 29:18.018
_Can't even wear
Infrared goggles.

29:18.050 --> 29:21.816
They'll give off radiation
and cloud the film.

29:21.860 --> 29:25.023
I'm happy to do it
for you, if you want.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.824
Privacy guaranteed.
(Francis chuckles softly.)

29:38.470 --> 29:40.461
- Thank you for the offer.

29:48.180 --> 29:49.818
(cane tapping the ground)

29:54.590 --> 29:57.559
(cane tapping the ground)

29:57.590 --> 29:59.785
(cane tapping the ground)

30:17.080 --> 30:19.503
Miss McClane.
- Mr. D.

30:22.580 --> 30:25.310
- Can I give you
a ride home?

30:25.350 --> 30:28.114
- Thank you. I take the bus
all the time; you don't

30:28.160 --> 30:31.379
need to worry about me.
- I'm not worried.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.580
Ride with me...

30:35.500 --> 30:39.266
...for my... pleasure.

31:21.540 --> 31:24.304
- Come in,
and I'll give you a drink.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.624
- So...

32:16.660 --> 32:20.221
how long have you been
at Gateway?

32:20.270 --> 32:22.431
- Three months.

32:22.470 --> 32:24.609
I trained newly blind people
for ten years

32:24.640 --> 32:26.961
after I ﬁnished school.

32:27.010 --> 32:29.205
This is my first job
on the outside.

32:29.240 --> 32:33.643
- Outside... of what?
- The inside.

32:35.520 --> 32:39.081
I was training people
to live in the sighted world;

32:39.120 --> 32:42.089
I didn't live in it myself.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.122
Thought I'd get out,

32:44.160 --> 32:46.151
knock around a little.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.544
I wanted to go
into speech therapy

33:06.580 --> 33:08.775
for speech-and-hearing-
impaired children.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.415
I expect I'll go back to that,
one of these days.

33:12.450 --> 33:15.681
Do you cook?

33:21.530 --> 33:23.555
- Uh-huh.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.522
- How about coffee?

33:27.370 --> 33:31.409
- Uh-huh.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.806
- Let's talk about
something for a minute

33:33.840 --> 33:36.707
and get it out of the way.

33:36.740 --> 33:40.574
You haven't said anything since
I mentioned speech therapy.

33:40.610 --> 33:44.319
I understand you
because you speak very well

33:44.350 --> 33:46.341
and because I listen.

33:46.390 --> 33:48.608
People don't pay attention.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.686
If you don't want to talk, OK,

33:51.730 --> 33:54.290
but I hope that you do talk
because you can

33:54.330 --> 33:56.753
and because I'm interested
In what you have to say.

33:56.800 --> 33:59.689
- Uh-huh.

33:59.730 --> 34:02.460
That's good.

34:05.440 --> 34:08.170
- Here's what
I like, Francis.

34:08.210 --> 34:12.101
I've felt no sympathy from you.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.118
I like that.

34:14.150 --> 34:17.574
Sympathy feels like
spit on my cheek.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.544
And I don't do self-pity.

34:20.590 --> 34:23.058
May I touch your face?

34:24.830 --> 34:28.197
I just want to know
if you're smiling or frowning.

34:28.230 --> 34:32.189
I wanna know
whether to just shut up or not.

34:37.370 --> 34:39.361
(small chuckle)

34:41.540 --> 34:44.748
- Trust me...

34:44.780 --> 34:47.647
I'm smiling.

35:02.630 --> 35:05.326
(sigh)
- [Hello, hotshot.]

35:05.370 --> 35:07.565
You doing some good?

35:07.600 --> 35:09.568
- [Nothing you'd notice.]

35:09.600 --> 35:11.568
I'm lonesome.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.532
- [Hmm... Me too.]

35:13.570 --> 35:16.130
I'm feeling Randy.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.705
- Me too.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.604
- Randy's our new dog.

35:20.650 --> 35:23.346
- Oh, hell.
(Will laughing)

35:23.380 --> 35:26.247
- Randy's got huge balls.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.588
- [Never mind about his balls.]

35:28.620 --> 35:30.850
- They almost drag
on the ground.

35:30.890 --> 35:33.188
He has to retract them
when he runs.

35:33.230 --> 35:38.258
(Will laughing)
Can you retract yours?

35:38.300 --> 35:40.825
- I retracted them once
when I was a kid.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.808
Had to clear
a barbed-wire fence,

35:44.840 --> 35:46.808
carrying a stolen watermelon.
(woman laughing)

35:46.840 --> 35:49.900
- Criminal mind
even at that age.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.880
- I_don't have
a crImInal mInd.

36:00.890 --> 36:04.223
- Of course you don't.

36:06.260 --> 36:09.627
- We have a new... new dog.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.628
- [Newer than Randy?]

36:13.400 --> 36:15.868
There was no one...

36:15.900 --> 36:17.663
left to claim her,
so I claimed her.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.668
- [You're a very sweet man.]

36:19.710 --> 36:22.634
I love you,

36:22.680 --> 36:24.773
and I miss you,

36:24.810 --> 36:27.574
and you're doing
the right thing.

36:27.610 --> 36:30.647
[It's costing you too,
I know that.]

36:30.680 --> 36:32.944
I'm here...

36:32.990 --> 36:36.448
and I'll be here
whenever you come home.

36:36.490 --> 36:37.957
- Good night, Molly.

37:01.350 --> 37:03.443
(silent scream)

37:03.480 --> 37:05.846
(gasping)

37:50.030 --> 37:52.294
I thought I'd seen
the last of you, Jack.

37:52.330 --> 37:55.766
- Dr. Lecter.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.635
- You're dressing younger.

37:59.670 --> 38:02.707
Have you taken up some sport
you enjoy with a new partner?

38:02.740 --> 38:04.708
Tennis, maybe?

38:04.750 --> 38:06.706
- You've taken up your sport

38:06.750 --> 38:08.945
with an old partner.

38:08.980 --> 38:11.619
- I wrote Will a note...

38:11.650 --> 38:14.448
warning him you'd come calling.
- Yes, I read your note

38:14.490 --> 38:16.981
before my office
forwarded it to Will.

38:19.790 --> 38:22.395
- To wet his appetite or yours?

38:22.430 --> 38:25.092
You've placed him
back in the pot,

38:25.130 --> 38:27.769
and you're letting him cook.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.531
- We're all in this stew
together, Doctor.

38:31.570 --> 38:33.606
- It would be more honest

38:33.640 --> 38:36.006
if you ate his brain right out
of his skull.

38:36.040 --> 38:37.837
- And you're nothing
if not honest.

38:44.650 --> 38:47.744
- This shy boy
has already seen Will.

38:47.790 --> 38:50.509
He already knows his name.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.051
Are you chumming
the waters, Jack?

38:53.090 --> 38:55.752
- It takes one to catch one.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.997
- It takes two
to catch one.

38:59.030 --> 39:02.136
- Will has never been
more effective

39:02.170 --> 39:03.967
than he is with you
inside his head.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.968
- I agree,

39:06.010 --> 39:08.808
but don't think you can
persuade me to play along

39:08.840 --> 39:11.604
with appeals
to my intellectual vanity.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.800
- I don't think
I'll persuade you, Doctor.

39:13.850 --> 39:17.570
You'll either play,
or you won't.

39:28.130 --> 39:30.849
- Bella used to say
your face was all scars,

39:30.900 --> 39:32.891
if you knew how to look.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.730
There's always room
for a few more.

39:40.010 --> 39:43.707
How much room
does Will have, Jack?

40:03.560 --> 40:05.494
(phone ringing)

40:09.940 --> 40:11.908
Hello?

40:11.940 --> 40:12.861
(static)

40:12.910 --> 40:16.004
- man: [They know.]

40:23.750 --> 40:26.048
- They're coming.

40:28.250 --> 40:31.048
- Are we going?

40:33.830 --> 40:36.219
- We're waiting for Will.

40:36.260 --> 40:38.660
It's important that he sees you.

40:38.700 --> 40:40.691
I want you two to be together.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.891
- They'll catch us
if we stay.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.761
- I'm on my honour
to look after you, Abigail.

40:45.810 --> 40:48.005
You have to look
after me, too.

40:48.040 --> 40:50.179
We have to protect
each other

40:50.210 --> 40:52.201
in these new lives
we create.

40:54.210 --> 40:57.213
I want you
to go upstairs and wait.

40:59.150 --> 41:01.243
- For what?

41:01.290 --> 41:04.555
- Hunting with your father was
the best time you've ever had...

41:06.090 --> 41:09.196
...now you're going
to hunt with me.

41:26.110 --> 41:28.647
- It's your attorney.
- Thank you.

41:47.270 --> 41:50.831
Hello?
- man: [Hello, Dr. Lecter.]

41:50.870 --> 41:55.204
[I wanted to tell you
that I am delighted]

41:55.240 --> 41:58.004
[that you have taken
an interest in me.]

41:58.040 --> 42:01.009
[I don't believe
you would tell them]

42:01.050 --> 42:03.871
[who I am, even if you knew.]

42:03.920 --> 42:06.286
[The important thing...]

42:06.320 --> 42:08.618
[is what I am becoming.]

42:08.660 --> 42:12.983
[I knew, you alone
would understand this.]

42:13.030 --> 42:15.919
- Tell me.

42:15.960 --> 42:18.326
What are you becoming?

42:18.360 --> 42:21.022
- [The Great...]

42:21.070 --> 42:23.994
[Red Dragon.]
