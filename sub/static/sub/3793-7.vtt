01:31.458 --> 01:33.449
I feel small.
You feel small, E?

01:33.493 --> 01:34.755
Shut up, Turtle.

01:34.794 --> 01:36.386
There's no need to be shy.
They're just models.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.124
I'm not shy.
In fact, I can't wait

01:38.164 --> 01:40.359
till I get to fuck a girl
while she rests her tits on my forehead.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.163
Oh right, like you
could ever get a model.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.363
- What, like you could?
- Like either of you could.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.964
- No, E did. Perfect 10 model, remember?
- Thank you.

01:47.006 --> 01:49.873
Come on, bro. She was a West Coast
model. That don't count.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.501
Why, Drama?
What's the difference?

01:51.544 --> 01:53.136
That's like asking what's
the difference between

01:53.179 --> 01:55.147
Central Park
and Park La Brea.

01:55.181 --> 01:57.012
When have you been
to Central Park?

01:57.050 --> 01:59.746
I don't brag to you guys
about all my conquests.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.447
No, usually you just
lie about them.

02:01.488 --> 02:03.479
I've never even heard
him lie about a model.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.821
Whatever. Tonight I'm gonna fuck
something so tall

02:05.859 --> 02:08.520
her scuff marks will be on
my ceiling for proof.

02:08.561 --> 02:10.961
These accessories are not
the best look for you, Vincent.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.828
Why you so mean, Shauna?

02:12.866 --> 02:14.925
Yeah, come on, I need a little support.
I'm feeling insecure.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.766
Well, don't, because while Hollywood
doesn't appreciate this gorgeous face,

02:17.804 --> 02:19.772
the fashion world does.
Now are you excited?

02:19.806 --> 02:21.933
I don't know, Shauna.
I'm an actor, not a model.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.875
Dolce & Gabbana's gonna
pay you $1 million

02:23.910 --> 02:25.343
for a one-day
photo shoot in Italy.

02:25.378 --> 02:27.175
You'll act like
a fucking model, okay?

02:27.213 --> 02:28.578
Oh, he will.
And he's excited.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.344
- Good.
- Hey, Shauna.

02:30.383 --> 02:33.841
Come on, I want to introduce you to
the man who made this all happen.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.651
We'll be over here
scoping out the terrain.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.247
Good luck, Johnny.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.623
How you doing, baby?

02:41.728 --> 02:43.093
Fucking Euro.

02:43.129 --> 02:46.587
- Fredrick, how are you?
- Hello, you sexy thing.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.897
- How are you?
- How you doing? Good.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.869
Vince, you have a very sexy
publicist, you know that?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.565
- I know.
- Vince, Fredrick Lyne.

02:52.605 --> 02:55.005
- Call me Freddy.
- Okay, Freddy.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.100
Freddy's the marketing genius
who put Madonna and Halle Berry

02:57.143 --> 02:58.701
in the Versace campaigns
when he was over there.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.576
It's what I do.
I put people together with things.

03:00.613 --> 03:02.308
And you, sunshine, I could
put together with anything.

03:02.348 --> 03:03.372
Fabulous.

03:03.416 --> 03:06.442
Now Annie Leibovitz is shooting it.
You met her?

03:06.486 --> 03:08.420
Lovely girl.
Not quick, but she's very very good.

03:08.454 --> 03:10.922
We're shooting at Mick Jagger's estate,
which is unbelievable.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.049
- Gorgeous.
- Sounds great.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.423
Natasha!
I want you to meet your co-star,

03:14.460 --> 03:16.690
'cause she is something else.
Natasha!

03:18.831 --> 03:19.923
Sorry.

03:19.966 --> 03:24.630
Guys, this ravishing creature
here is Natasha Ladianova.

03:24.671 --> 03:27.902
She is fast becoming the hottest model
on the entire planet bar none.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.909
Think you can
see why.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.740
Natasha,
Vincent Chase.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.474
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.541
- Eric Murphy. How are you?
- Oh, nice to meet you.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.816
They look fantastic together.
You've got an amazing eye, Fredrick.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.321
Yeah.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.221
Yeah, great.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.818
Listen, I've got to drag you off to meet
some magazine people.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.090
- Bye.
- Uh, Natasha.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.097
Yeah, certainly,
Bye.

03:52.131 --> 03:53.894
Vince, I'll see you later
at the fitting, yes?

03:53.933 --> 03:56.834
- Ciao, Fredrick.
- Nice to meet you guys.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.996
You fucked that girl,
didn't you?

03:59.038 --> 04:00.130
No.

04:00.173 --> 04:03.506
- But you know her.
- Uh-huh.

04:11.317 --> 04:13.080
I hate myself
for the fact

04:13.119 --> 04:15.451
that even today
I still don't like you.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.250
I mean, I want to.
I do.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.087
- Ari!
- Baby, I'm...

04:19.125 --> 04:21.024
- Ari.
- John.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.187
I am so sorry.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.527
Yeah, it's a shame.
He was having a good run.

04:25.565 --> 04:26.998
Yeah.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.092
I was on the golf course
with him when it happened.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.762
- Oh.
- Yeah.

04:30.803 --> 04:34.330
You know, he promised Vincent
Chase "Smokejumpers."

04:34.374 --> 04:37.969
We should keep that good run going
by honoring that promise.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.377
I'll speak to you after
we've paid our respects.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.005
Of course. Of course.
Of course.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.185
Listen, just excuse me
for one second, baby.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.085
No business, Ari.
Respect.

04:49.122 --> 04:52.148
Respect means keeping business
alive even when you're dead.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.125
Remember that.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.720
John, what do you say
we bring Vince back

04:56.763 --> 04:59.698
to the studio just to pay
tribute to Alan?

04:59.732 --> 05:02.462
I sell airplane
engines, Ari.

05:02.502 --> 05:05.903
The studio accounts
for 5% of our business.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.372
I can't focus on who's
doing what in what movie.

05:08.408 --> 05:10.239
His replacement
will have to do that.

05:10.276 --> 05:11.800
Who you thinking about?

05:11.844 --> 05:13.937
I'm thinking about you.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.914
Really?

05:15.948 --> 05:18.246
I thought about you
when I fist hired Alan,

05:18.284 --> 05:20.275
but you were still
a bit green.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.981
Well, a lot has changed
since then.

05:22.021 --> 05:23.682
It certainly has.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.020
You've made me
an even richer man

05:25.058 --> 05:27.253
by bringing me three
tentpoles in three years.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.352
Maybe it's time
I returned the favor.

05:29.395 --> 05:32.694
Ready to move from the ground floor
to the penthouse, Ari?

05:36.703 --> 05:39.001
- You saw the connection.
- I think everyone did.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.871
I only saw Drama strike out with every
model in the place.

05:41.908 --> 05:44.069
Shut it, Turtle.
These things take time.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.840
Vince had an 11-hour flight
to secure that chemistry.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.404
L.A. To London.
I don't even remember why I was going,

05:49.449 --> 05:51.280
but I definitely
remember Natasha.

05:51.317 --> 05:52.944
11 hours?
Why didn't you just mile-high it?

05:52.985 --> 05:54.509
We were both
in a relationship.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.044
How do you know she's not
still in a relationship?

05:56.089 --> 05:57.215
I can tell.

06:06.699 --> 06:08.360
Ready for round two,
Drama?

06:08.401 --> 06:10.961
Funny, E.
But the odds are in my favor here.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.664
How do you figure?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.900
It's a fitting.
They're already naked and vulnerable.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.465
Just try not to get
arrested again.

06:16.509 --> 06:18.136
At least in jail
he can probably get some.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.407
Whatever.
Watch and learn.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.641
Incoming.

06:22.682 --> 06:24.309
- Hi there.
- Hello, Vince.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.375
I hear you joined
the Dolce & Gabbana campaign.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.979
- Yes, I'm very excited.
- Hey, I recognize you.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.818
You were on the cover
of "Vogue" last month.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.848
- "Cosmo."
- Right.

06:32.892 --> 06:35.053
A very nice spread,
if I may say.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.255
Thank you.
I recognize you too.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.389
- Oh yeah?
- You were on "The View."

06:39.432 --> 06:41.662
You had a meltdown.
Not very nice, if I may say.

06:41.701 --> 06:44.363
It's not
his finest hour.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.797
Do I know you?

06:47.840 --> 06:49.273
Uh, I'm Eric.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.538
- I'm Raina.
- Nice to meet you.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.704
Good things come
in small packages.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.277
Nice to meet you, Vince.
And you, Eric.

07:01.220 --> 07:02.517
What the hell was that?

07:02.555 --> 07:04.750
I don't know.
I think she thinks you're cute.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.760
Cute like a little compact
bundle of joy.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.659
More like you're so
little and cute

07:09.695 --> 07:12.687
she wants to strap something on
and stuff you like a turkey.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.529
Hey, Vince, can I get you
over here to get started?

07:14.567 --> 07:16.364
Yeah, sure.
I'll be right back.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.393
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.998
- So is Natasha here yet?
- You mean Helena?

07:21.040 --> 07:24.305
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, how are you?

07:24.343 --> 07:26.004
- Vincent Chase, there he is.
- Hey.

07:26.045 --> 07:28.172
- The man, the legend.
- So what do you think?

07:28.214 --> 07:29.704
Let's have a look at you.

07:29.749 --> 07:32.343
- Very very nice. Turn around.
- Thank you.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.149
Absolutely terrible in the ass.
Do something about that, please.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.621
So, Freddy,
is Natasha not coming?

07:36.656 --> 07:38.283
This is Helena,
her replacement.

07:38.324 --> 07:39.552
- Did you meet?
- Yeah.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.560
Replacement?
What happened?

07:41.594 --> 07:43.425
Oh, I don't know.
She's a model, you know?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.363
She probably had her period,
thought she got stabbed.

07:45.398 --> 07:48.424
All right, come on.
Let's get the pants on.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.966
How would you like to be
fucking a studio head, baby?

07:51.003 --> 07:52.834
Well, Ron Meyers
is pretty handsome.

07:52.872 --> 07:54.203
Ha ha.
Seriously, what do you think?

07:54.240 --> 07:56.174
I think I've never
seen anyone

07:56.209 --> 07:58.905
so giddy
after a funeral, Ari.

07:58.945 --> 08:01.573
This is the kind of offer you dream
about getting your whole life.

08:01.614 --> 08:04.014
- So you're gonna take it?
- I don't know.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.848
- Your clients are gonna be pretty upset.
- Give me a break, honey.

08:06.886 --> 08:09.684
Look, there's probably maybe two clients
that I really care about.

08:09.722 --> 08:11.553
Vinnie is one of them.
And if I take the job

08:11.591 --> 08:13.491
I can put him in this
movie that he wants.

08:15.595 --> 08:19.053
Dana Gordon, you're on speakerphone
and my wife's in the car.

08:19.098 --> 08:22.192
- Oh, uh, hi.
- Hello.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.601
So how was the funeral?

08:24.637 --> 08:27.367
- It was fun.
- So you spoke to John?

08:27.406 --> 08:30.534
Spoke to John about what?

08:30.576 --> 08:33.669
I was at that place for a decade, Ari.
I know all about it.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.203
Okay, what do you want?

08:35.248 --> 08:36.772
I want to be under you.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.875
Dana, I told you
my wife's in the car.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.148
Very funny.
I want to be your number two.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.451
I know everyone there.
I helped build that place.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.616
And if it weren't for Alan
being such a woman-hating

08:45.658 --> 08:47.421
piece of shit,
I'd still be helping.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.860
Understood.
Listen, let's see how it plays out.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.126
Just asking for
consideration, Ari.

08:52.164 --> 08:53.654
- I'll get back to you.
- Bye.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.395
"I'm on speaker
with my wife in the car"?

08:56.435 --> 08:59.097
- It's common courtesy.
- What were you afraid she was gonna say?

08:59.138 --> 09:00.400
- Nothing.
- Who is she?

09:00.439 --> 09:02.930
Nobody.
She's a studio exec. A good one.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.136
In fact, she'd make
a great number two.

09:05.177 --> 09:06.508
Did you fuck her?

09:07.914 --> 09:09.882
Maybe she wouldn't.

09:09.916 --> 09:13.443
Who gives a shit
why some model quit?

09:13.486 --> 09:16.455
They're like cockroaches, stamp one out
and 50 lookalikes show up in their place.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.514
I want a number, Shauna,
not a lecture.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.356
Well, I can't get it and her agency wants
to know who it's for

09:21.394 --> 09:23.589
because apparently 50 actors
a week call trying to bang her.

09:23.629 --> 09:24.857
Oh, great.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.831
Look, what's the big deal?
You really like this one?

09:26.866 --> 09:28.493
I'm just curious to know
what happened.

09:28.534 --> 09:31.162
Christy, where are
all the models staying?

09:31.203 --> 09:34.400
- At the W.
- The W, Vince.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.307
Go there if it's really eating
you, but go cautiously

09:37.343 --> 09:40.506
because if she really did quit over you,
showing up could be really creepy.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.515
Thanks, Shauna. You don't think she quit
'cause of me, do you?

09:43.549 --> 09:44.641
- No shot.
- No way.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.276
Maybe.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.480
It's possible.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.118
How was the funeral, Ari?

09:53.159 --> 09:54.751
It was delightful.
Are you kidding?

09:54.794 --> 09:56.591
Alan has not looked
that good in years.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.597
Ari, that's very macabre.

09:58.631 --> 10:01.065
- What's been going on here?
- Jeffrey Tambor stopped by.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.398
- Oh God, is he gone?
- Yes, but he said he'll be back.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.631
- Excellent. What else?
- Barbara's been looking for you.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.298
- Don't tell her I'm back.
- Ari.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.706
- I won't say a word.
- Babs, what's the haps?

10:09.742 --> 10:11.266
Sussman and Levinson want
some face time with you.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.675
They're your clients.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.180
They're coming in for a meeting and they
want to know they have your support.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.614
Well, they're reality TV writers,
so they don't have my support.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.551
They made $4 million
last year, Ari.

10:20.586 --> 10:22.315
Understood, but they're
your clients.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.449
- They want to branch out.
- To what, the circus?

10:25.491 --> 10:26.719
Features.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.284
Oh come on.
I met those freaks.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.762
If it wasn't for losers
eating bull cock tempura,

10:31.797 --> 10:33.788
they'd be lucky
to produce a decent infomercial.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.495
They're coming in after lunch.
Do you have a minute to say hello?

10:36.535 --> 10:38.230
- Tell her I'm busy.
- He's got a lot on his plate.

10:38.270 --> 10:41.068
- I'll bring them by.
- Come with a gun.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.039
What's this?

10:46.078 --> 10:48.546
It came this morning with
that box and that note.

10:48.581 --> 10:49.605
Do you want me to read it?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.276
No, I want you to get out
and close the door.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.855
Jesus!

11:01.894 --> 11:04.488
- What've you got there, Ari?
- I asked you to get the fuck out.

11:04.530 --> 11:07.328
Yes, but John Ellis is on the phone.
I figured you'd want it.

11:07.366 --> 11:08.993
Put him through.

11:09.035 --> 11:10.900
Like the new watch,
Ari Gold.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.426
And your little plane.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.402
I love the watch, John.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.307
That's an Audemars
Piguet, Ari.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.778
Possibly the finest timepiece
known to man.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.838
What can I say?
I'm a fan.

11:22.882 --> 11:26.181
Fan enough to come to Geneva to watch
me try to buy the company?

11:27.386 --> 11:29.115
Are you serious?

11:29.155 --> 11:32.147
I never fuck around when I'm talking about
a billion-dollar deal.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.955
Bring your wife.
I'll show you Switzerland on a Wednesday.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.224
I'll also show you
what could be.

11:37.263 --> 11:40.255
Well, you know, I got
a lot of things going on here, John.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.290
No pressure, Ari.
It's not how I do it.

11:42.334 --> 11:45.303
I've got a Gulfstream leaving
out of Van Nuys at 7:00.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.066
If you're on it, good.
If not...

11:47.106 --> 11:49.199
I'll talk to you
when I'm back.

11:49.241 --> 11:50.936
Enjoy the day.

11:52.244 --> 11:53.871
Are you hiding
something from me, Ari?

11:53.913 --> 11:56.404
Only my cock
and my asshole, Lloyd.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.318
How you doing, honey?

12:05.357 --> 12:07.325
Which one of us
are you calling honey?

12:07.359 --> 12:10.385
Whichever one of you
is interested.

12:10.429 --> 12:12.260
That would be
neither of us.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.601
These models must
all be cycling together

12:16.635 --> 12:19.536
- 'cause they got bad attitudes.
- You got bad game.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.369
Oh yeah, yours is pretty
good today too, Turtle.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.466
Oh, I've given up playing.
At this point I'm just hoping

12:23.509 --> 12:25.670
an insecure civilian
walks by that I can fuck.

12:25.711 --> 12:28.612
- That's just sad.
- Room 813.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.308
- We'll wait down here.
- Cool.

12:30.349 --> 12:32.010
- Don't do anything we wouldn't do.
- I won't.

12:32.051 --> 12:34.611
And don't forget to tell her
no one likes a quitter, bro.

12:34.653 --> 12:36.177
Okay, Johnny.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.349
No one likes a quitter?

12:38.390 --> 12:40.221
I need a drink.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.656
- I got this one.
- Big shot.

12:44.697 --> 12:47.188
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

12:47.233 --> 12:48.928
Strange seeing you here.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.435
You're not following
me, are you?

12:50.469 --> 12:52.903
Actually, no. Vince is meeting with
one of your co-workers.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.031
And who are you
meeting with?

12:55.074 --> 12:56.302
I'm not meeting
with anyone.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.673
Yes you are.
Me.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.200
You boys mind
if I kidnap him?

12:59.245 --> 13:03.375
You have any friends
that might want to hold us hostage?

13:03.415 --> 13:05.508
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't fight me.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.314
If you do I will
sweep you off your feet

13:07.353 --> 13:09.719
and carry you
to my room.

13:09.755 --> 13:14.215
Am I not the one on
the network fucking TV show?

13:19.398 --> 13:21.730
- Hey, Vince.
- Hey.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.291
I'm Vivica.
Come on in.

13:23.335 --> 13:25.633
Thank you.

13:25.671 --> 13:27.571
Is Natasha here?

13:27.606 --> 13:29.471
No, she left.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.237
Oh, really?
Where'd she go?

13:31.277 --> 13:33.837
She had to go to Majorca,
I think.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.074
- Or maybe Hawaii.
- Oh wow.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.345
At least
they're both hot.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.251
Yeah, I think she was more excited
about going to Italy with you.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.017
And if she wasn't so
worried about her career

13:44.056 --> 13:45.921
she probably would've told
Fredrick to go fuck himself.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.721
Really?
What happened?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.955
- He told me she quit.
- Of course he did.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.589
He's a fucking liar
and he's obsessed with her.

13:52.631 --> 13:54.155
He saw you two vibing
at the party

13:54.200 --> 13:56.498
so he moved her to the lookbook shoot
and shipped her off.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.060
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

13:59.104 --> 14:01.698
Listen, don't tell him this because
I still want to work for him,

14:01.740 --> 14:04.709
- but Fredrick's a psycho.
- Yeah, sounds like it.

14:04.743 --> 14:06.711
Do you have her number?
I'd love to call her.

14:06.745 --> 14:08.042
Sorry, I don't.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.877
How about I leave you mine
just in case you see her?

14:09.915 --> 14:11.746
Sure, go ahead.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.945
You know, Vince,
you should stick around.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.648
I was about to puff a J,
take a bath.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.987
You could join.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.788
Sounds tempting...
very tempting.

14:21.827 --> 14:25.194
But I don't think
that's such a good idea.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.597
Okay, but I was just
testing you anyway.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.067
I'm gonna tell Natasha
that you're a good guy.

14:30.102 --> 14:32.127
Thank you.

14:32.171 --> 14:34.639
- Bye, Vince
- Ciao.

14:37.776 --> 14:40.336
Wow, nice room.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.438
Big stars get
the biggest rooms.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.005
No offense to
the little people,

14:44.049 --> 14:46.517
present company
excluded of course.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.112
- That's funny.
- Humor is one of many talents.

14:49.154 --> 14:51.884
Would you like to see
some of my others?

14:51.924 --> 14:53.482
Okay.

14:55.361 --> 14:57.295
You coming?

14:59.398 --> 15:01.195
In there?

15:08.941 --> 15:11.671
I heard you're a very
successful talent manager.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.041
Yeah, I've been
getting into the...

15:13.078 --> 15:14.943
I would like to
show you my reel.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.345
No problem.

15:16.382 --> 15:19.613
- Okay.
- Good.

15:24.189 --> 15:25.884
Very natural, no?

15:34.066 --> 15:35.624
- Busy day.
- Hey, Jeff.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.068
I tried to stop him but he could see you
procrastinating...

15:38.103 --> 15:41.300
- Like you could stop me anyway, Lloyd.
- Very true, Jeffrey.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.672
What's going on, Ari?
I called you this morning.

15:43.709 --> 15:45.506
You call me every morning.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.375
Yeah, but I called you this morning
and you did not call me back.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.472
Yeah, but I always
call you back, okay?

15:49.515 --> 15:51.483
Did you think maybe
that I had something else going on?

15:51.517 --> 15:53.917
What did you have going on?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.319
Alan Gray died.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.346
Yeah, so what?
I hated that prick.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.652
I know you did.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.751
You know, that man
had the audacity

16:01.794 --> 16:05.457
to tell me that he was gonna
put me in the Branagh film?

16:05.497 --> 16:07.624
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm not in that.

16:07.666 --> 16:09.725
I know.
I know.

16:09.768 --> 16:11.565
Who's the new guy
gonna be?

16:11.603 --> 16:13.594
Hope he likes me.

16:13.639 --> 16:14.901
How could he not?

16:14.940 --> 16:16.737
What are you
doing for lunch?

16:16.775 --> 16:18.538
Let me... Jeff.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.674
How come you don't do
another TV show?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.440
I don't want to do
any more TV.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.746
That's Satan's work.

16:26.785 --> 16:28.343
Yeah, but you're bored
out of your mind.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.083
Yeah, well get me
a fucking job.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.717
Every day I get an offer for you
and you don't want to do anything.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.818
- I wanted to do that Pitt film.
- You wanted to do his role.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.658
You're a dick.
Listen to me.

16:37.696 --> 16:39.357
- You listening?
- Yes.

16:39.398 --> 16:42.196
Okay, I brought
the breakdowns.

16:42.234 --> 16:45.260
I just want to go through everything
that they're getting ready to shoot

16:45.304 --> 16:47.932
and I want to see what
you think I'm right for.

16:47.973 --> 16:50.168
Now look at this,
"Good Goodbye."

16:50.209 --> 16:52.143
How bad can that be?

16:52.177 --> 16:54.008
Can we?

16:54.046 --> 16:56.378
"Big Deal Jimmy."

16:56.415 --> 16:58.440
What the fuck is wrong
with "Big Deal Jimmy"?

16:58.484 --> 17:00.782
I could be in that.
"Laugh Laugh Daddy."

17:00.819 --> 17:04.117
- There has to be a father's role in there.
- Lloyd!

17:04.156 --> 17:06.124
Come on, Vince.
You can fuck whoever you want.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.750
Just do it after
this campaign.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.590
I can't work a job knowing that a girl
got fired because of me.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.961
You're gonna make $1 million
for looking pretty.

17:12.998 --> 17:15.262
$1 million that you
and those morons

17:15.300 --> 17:16.961
standing behind you
desperately need.

17:17.002 --> 17:18.663
So please
don't fuck this up.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.537
- Shauna, give me the address.
- What are you gonna do?

17:21.573 --> 17:23.871
I'm gonna talk to him.
Don't worry, I'll be on my best behavior.

17:23.909 --> 17:27.208
Fine.
670 South Main, penthouse.

17:27.246 --> 17:30.079
Thank you,
as always.

17:30.115 --> 17:33.607
Well, that was quick.
Either he couldn't close

17:33.652 --> 17:36.280
or the sheer physics
of the act was too overwhelming.

17:36.321 --> 17:39.722
Actually, I've been trying to figure out
how it would line up.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.661
So I was right?
She was into you?

17:43.695 --> 17:46.391
No, you weren't right. She's an actress,
thought I could help manage her.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.957
- Thank God.
- Oh, you're happy about that?

17:49.001 --> 17:50.935
If I can't fuck a model
today, nobody should.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.335
- You're a real team player, Drama.
- I know, right?

17:53.372 --> 17:54.498
- So can she act?
- No.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.838
- No model can.
- And she's a bitch.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.843
I mean, she leans over me
to talk to me.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.344
- Come on.
- She's taller than you.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.870
You're taller than me too.
You don't lean over me.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.008
Sorry, E.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.642
- Poor E.
- Woe is E.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.676
How did it go
with Natasha?

18:08.720 --> 18:11.188
It's still going.

18:11.390 --> 18:12.982
No no, hold it.
You wait a minute.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.856
So what I'm hearing
from my own agent

18:14.893 --> 18:17.919
is that you don't think I have the acting
chops to play Marcel Proust?

18:17.963 --> 18:19.760
What I'm saying
is I don't think

18:19.798 --> 18:22.266
that an audience is gonna
buy you as a gay Frenchman.

18:22.301 --> 18:23.632
You know
I speak French?

18:23.669 --> 18:25.796
I meant it
as a compliment.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.602
- It didn't feel like one.
- Excuse me, Jeffrey Tambor.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.540
- I'm sorry.
- Apology not accepted.

18:30.576 --> 18:32.476
- Ari, listen to me.
- Jeff, take a breath.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.035
Please, Lloyd, please
tell me that someone

18:34.079 --> 18:36.047
hit my dog with a car
and I have to get out of here.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.572
No, Ari, your wife is on the phone
and wants to know why

18:38.617 --> 18:41.711
you sent over a set of Louis Vuitton
luggage and quite frankly so do I.

18:41.753 --> 18:43.914
- He'll call back.
- Hold on, Jeffrey, just...

18:43.956 --> 18:46.481
- Sorry to interrupt. Hello, Jeffrey.
- Barbara.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.857
- Ari.
- You know what? I'll call her back.

18:48.894 --> 18:50.225
I got a really important
meeting with Barbara.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.354
How long do you need him?

18:51.396 --> 18:52.795
- Not long.
- Long.

18:52.831 --> 18:55.664
I'll wait. Hey, take notes.
Let's go.

18:55.701 --> 18:57.498
Just say hello quickly.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.629
There's the man.
We know your time is precious.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.502
Not for talented
people like you.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.008
So I hear you want to make
the jump into features.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.805
We want to write something
for Peter Jackson.

19:05.844 --> 19:08.904
He usually writes
his own stuff.

19:08.947 --> 19:10.574
Well, we have a take
on "The Hobbit."

19:10.616 --> 19:12.982
We want to make him a giant.
I'm kidding.

19:13.018 --> 19:14.280
Seriously,
we have a take.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.446
Okay, he wrote all three
"Lord of the Rings."

19:16.488 --> 19:18.080
So I think he's gonna
want to write that.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.590
Maybe, maybe not.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.560
Oh, okay.
Well, do you have a sample?

19:22.594 --> 19:24.084
We do.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.259
- It's "The Hobbit."
- We did it on spec.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.394
But we don't want
to just send it to him.

19:31.436 --> 19:33.233
No, we want to present
it face to face.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.706
- Uh, he's in New Zealand.
- We have a plane.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.333
We just got it.
You can come.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.943
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Ari.

19:41.980 --> 19:43.948
Can we just give you the quick pitch?
It's very short.

19:43.982 --> 19:46.280
- Oh, I have to go to the bathroom.
- Ari, sit.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.548
- Ari, stay.
- The whole thing's a metaphor.

19:48.587 --> 19:50.680
- I speak French.
- Ari!

19:52.291 --> 19:54.384
- Where are you going, Ari?
- To the bathroom.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.053
- Bathroom's the other way.
- Honey, listen.

19:56.094 --> 19:59.427
Yeah, pack those bags.
We're going to Geneva tonight.

19:59.464 --> 20:01.625
- Vive la France!
- Geneva, Ari?

20:01.667 --> 20:04.659
What is going on?
What should I tell Jeffrey?

20:04.703 --> 20:07.137
I don't give a fuck.

20:07.172 --> 20:10.300
Vinnie, I think it's really sweet how
concerned you are about the campaign,

20:10.342 --> 20:12.537
but it doesn't matter who the model is.
She's decoration.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.637
You're the money.
You're the brand. Want a drink?

20:14.680 --> 20:17.376
Yeah, I just thought
we had really great chemistry.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.816
I'm not sure I really felt
it with this other girl.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.614
Well, let's dump her.
Know what I mean?

20:21.653 --> 20:23.621
You can choose whoever you want.
I'll get you a book.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.021
You know, Freddy, I think your instincts
were right the first time.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.959
- We should go with Natasha.
- What are we gonna do? She quit.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.928
Really?

20:30.963 --> 20:33.591
Did she?

20:33.632 --> 20:36.260
Why, what did she
tell you?

20:37.836 --> 20:39.929
All right, fuck it.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.270
I fired her.
She lied to me.

20:42.307 --> 20:44.832
She never told me when I booked her
that she knew you.

20:44.876 --> 20:46.343
We don't really
know each other.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.107
We shared
a plane ride together.

20:48.146 --> 20:49.579
So why do you
give a fuck?

20:49.615 --> 20:52.049
- It's a principle thing.
- What principle?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.143
Look, I'm paying you
a fortune to do the photo shoot.

20:54.186 --> 20:57.587
Vinnie, don't blow this between you
and me. I've got big plans for you.

20:57.623 --> 21:00.353
Freddy, I am
a professional.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.019
Well, this don't seem
too professional to me.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.858
And firing a girl because
she doesn't want you is?

21:06.832 --> 21:09.596
Because she doesn't want me?
Is that what you think?

21:09.635 --> 21:11.102
Do you think she does?

21:11.136 --> 21:13.400
Of course she wants me.
They all want me. Look at me.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.338
I don't want her.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.035
No?
Then what do you want?

21:17.075 --> 21:19.509
I want you,
you beautiful boy.

21:21.079 --> 21:23.070
Look, I didn't know
you had a history.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.049
No, I'll compete
with all the other

21:25.083 --> 21:27.677
anorexic empty spaces,

21:27.719 --> 21:29.346
but I can't compete
with history.

21:30.656 --> 21:32.715
Freddy, there's no
competition.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.692
I'm not gay.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.387
I'm not even bi.

21:36.428 --> 21:39.192
Hey, I'm just a straight man
that likes sucking cock.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.762
No one's gonna know.

21:44.369 --> 21:46.269
Well...

21:48.273 --> 21:50.867
I guess I'm just not cut out
for the fashion world.

21:50.909 --> 21:53.844
Aw, forget it.
That whole world is deviants, bro.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.938
The dudes bang each other
while the chicks watch.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.279
The chicks bang each other
while more chicks watch.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.285
And yet nobody would let
you watch anything.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.946
Pick on me
all you want, Turtle,

22:01.987 --> 22:04.979
but you never and shall forever never
get what I've had.

22:05.023 --> 22:06.684
- Herpes?
- Oh!

22:06.725 --> 22:08.625
My dick is clean,
tiny man.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.423
What did you say?

22:10.462 --> 22:12.396
Hold on, hold on.
I'm getting a call.

22:12.431 --> 22:13.659
Chill out.
Hello?

22:13.699 --> 22:15.599
- Hey, Vince.
- Natasha.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.659
Hey, I got your message.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.534
Yeah, I wanted to say
I'm sorry about the campaign.

22:19.571 --> 22:21.801
Eh, that shit happens
all the time.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.569
Are you gonna be okay
without me?

22:23.608 --> 22:25.473
It's funny
you should ask.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.774
I couldn't face it alone
so I quit.

22:27.813 --> 22:29.110
- Really?
- Yup.

22:29.147 --> 22:31.206
Well, if you have
some free time

22:31.249 --> 22:33.183
why don't you come join me
to Hawaii for my shoot?

22:33.218 --> 22:35.345
We've plenty of space
on the plane.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.252
Oh yeah?
You got room for four?

22:37.289 --> 22:40.281
For sure.
And maybe bring your manager.

22:40.325 --> 22:43.089
- I have a special request for him.
- Great.

22:43.128 --> 22:46.291
So Van Nuys airport tonight.
I'll text you.

22:46.331 --> 22:47.958
- See you there.
- What's up?

22:47.999 --> 22:50.263
Models models
and more models.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.430
- I don't follow.
- Oh, but you will. You will.

22:56.241 --> 22:58.209
Why have I never heard
Dana's name before?

22:58.243 --> 23:01.838
Because it was 1990
and you were dating Jack Wagner.

23:03.448 --> 23:05.348
Well, I don't think
I could live

23:05.384 --> 23:07.284
with having someone work
for you that you had sex with.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.480
Could you live with that?

23:14.793 --> 23:16.556
- Is Vince coming with us?
- What?

23:16.595 --> 23:18.927
Jesus Christ, what the fuck
is he doing here?

23:27.773 --> 23:30.469
- Look at this power couple.
- Hey, there he is.

23:30.509 --> 23:32.340
Good to see you, sir.
How are you?

23:32.377 --> 23:34.242
- Hello, John.
- You look beautiful.

23:34.279 --> 23:36.907
Thank you for the lovely invitation.
Kate, hi.

23:36.948 --> 23:38.677
- Shall we?
- Yes, we shall.

23:38.717 --> 23:41.185
Um, can you just give me
one quick second?

23:41.219 --> 23:43.050
- Sure.
- Yeah.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.455
- Vinnie.
- Ari.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.083
- Small world, huh?
- What are you doing here?

23:48.126 --> 23:51.425
- Listen, we are taking a little trip.
- Yeah, us too.

23:51.463 --> 23:54.023
Yeah, I can see that you're saving
money by flying private again.

23:54.065 --> 23:56.966
Not our dime.
It's theirs.

23:57.002 --> 23:59.300
Nice dime.

23:59.337 --> 24:01.032
- Where are you headed?
- We're going to Geneva.

24:01.072 --> 24:02.505
That's Alan's boss
right there.

24:02.541 --> 24:03.940
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

24:03.975 --> 24:05.499
Aw, you're going
to Geneva for me?

24:07.946 --> 24:10.437
- Something wrong?
- Yeah, listen, Vinnie.

24:10.482 --> 24:14.009
Um, you're the only one
in this town that I'm telling this to.

24:14.052 --> 24:16.748
I'm in a position to get you
any job that we want

24:16.788 --> 24:19.985
- for the rest of your career.
- How so?

24:20.025 --> 24:21.754
They're offering
me Alan's position.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.658
They want me to run
the studio.

24:23.695 --> 24:25.686
- Wow.
- Yeah.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.755
I know, it just came out of the blue.
What do you think?

24:27.799 --> 24:30.233
I just...
I mean l...

24:30.268 --> 24:32.930
I think I'd like us to finish
what we started together,

24:32.971 --> 24:36.065
but I think you gotta do
what you gotta do, right?

24:36.107 --> 24:38.166
What are you thinking?

24:38.210 --> 24:40.235
I'm thinking...

24:41.780 --> 24:45.307
I don't know.
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

24:45.350 --> 24:46.874
I'll tell you that much.

24:46.918 --> 24:49.216
Wow.

24:53.058 --> 24:55.151
- Have a good trip.
- You too.

24:55.193 --> 24:56.922
All right.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.566
Yo, what's up?

25:04.603 --> 25:06.434
They just offered Ari
the studio head position.

25:06.471 --> 25:08.268
Is he gonna take it?

25:12.611 --> 25:14.545
What's up, bro?

25:14.579 --> 25:16.308
Vinnie.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.373
Hello hello.

25:18.416 --> 25:20.008
I figure we could just
pick up where we left off.

25:20.051 --> 25:21.985
- Okay.
- All right.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.352
There are more girls
coming, right?

25:24.389 --> 25:27.051
- Don't worry. Any second.
- They better be good looking.

25:28.793 --> 25:30.192
You're so lucky.

25:30.228 --> 25:32.594
I get so claustrophobic
and cramped on these flights.

25:32.631 --> 25:34.326
- Will you stop it, Raina?
- What?

25:34.366 --> 25:36.061
Because I'm not that
small, that's why.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.194
Oh, did I hurt your feelings?
I'm just teasing you.

25:38.236 --> 25:40.431
Yeah, well it's not
a very smart way to get a manager.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.337
I want a manager.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.309
But I need a spinner.

25:45.343 --> 25:48.039
Did she just
call him a spinner?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.806
Hello, ladies.

25:50.849 --> 25:53.545
- Hey, now we're talking.
- How you doing?

25:53.585 --> 25:55.644
Hey, how are you?
Who needs a drink?

25:55.687 --> 25:57.484
Drinks?

25:58.857 --> 26:02.793
So who's ready for five hours
of captivity?

26:03.828 --> 26:05.955
Drinks all around?

26:07.599 --> 26:09.123
Are you all right, Vince?

26:09.167 --> 26:11.328
How could I be better?
