00:04.585 --> 00:06.216
Previously on Beyond...

00:06.217 --> 00:08.468
Don't you ever feel like we're
a part of something bigger?

00:08.469 --> 00:09.889
- Oh, no.
- The cops?

00:09.890 --> 00:12.553
- Worse. My brother Jeff.
- Assface.

00:13.894 --> 00:15.225
You're dead.

00:15.226 --> 00:17.558
Ah!

00:21.232 --> 00:24.064
Your son was unconscious
for 12 years.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.986
You're in a hospital, son.
But you're okay. You're safe.

00:26.987 --> 00:29.199
- You're in a lot of trouble.
- What are you talking about?

00:29.200 --> 00:31.861
- They're going to be coming for you.
- I know who you are.

00:31.862 --> 00:34.204
I know what you can do.

00:34.205 --> 00:36.416
Holden, get in the car!

00:36.417 --> 00:39.119
- Who are you?
- It's me, Willa.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.251
I can't take you home. That's the
first place they'll look for you.

00:41.252 --> 00:43.083
I don't want any of this!

00:43.084 --> 00:45.215
Those past 12 years,
I watched you learn

00:45.216 --> 00:46.127
to do the things you can do.

00:46.128 --> 00:48.218
No more holding back.

00:48.219 --> 00:49.629
This is just a scratch
on the surface.

00:49.630 --> 00:51.551
Beneath that surface
is something dangerous

00:51.552 --> 00:54.175
if you don't learn
to control it.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.018
You don't have any more time.

00:59.019 --> 01:01.392
You have to go now.

01:02.893 --> 01:04.444
Feels like I just got here.

01:08.149 --> 01:09.240
They know who you are.

01:10.611 --> 01:12.153
They know
what you're going to do.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.122 --> 01:22.253
Here.

01:25.126 --> 01:26.467
For luck.

01:39.270 --> 01:42.022
I'll see you where the light
shines the brightest.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.407
Run!

02:30.731 --> 02:33.863
- That must be him now.
- Holden?

02:33.864 --> 02:35.196
Honey?

02:37.698 --> 02:40.950
Holden.
I'm Sheriff Dayton.

02:40.951 --> 02:43.162
This is Deputy Lee.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.455
You mind if we ask you
some questions?

02:45.456 --> 02:47.457
You're the police?

02:47.458 --> 02:50.211
Why don't you get dressed and...

02:51.001 --> 02:52.172
we'll talk.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.264
Is that necessary?

03:04.265 --> 03:07.066
You wouldn't ask if you
could see my handwriting.

03:07.067 --> 03:08.228
Am I in trouble?

03:08.229 --> 03:11.231
- No, of course not.
- Fifth Amendment, dude.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.112
Don't have to answer
anything you don't want to.

03:14.905 --> 03:15.946
I'll be quiet.

03:16.987 --> 03:18.489
You don't have to answer.

03:19.580 --> 03:22.322
But we're just hoping
you can help us

03:22.323 --> 03:23.784
fill in some blanks.

03:24.825 --> 03:26.586
Okay.

03:26.587 --> 03:27.588
Okay.

03:31.091 --> 03:33.963
Now can you confirm
where you were last night?

03:33.964 --> 03:35.336
Um...

03:38.759 --> 03:40.720
We were at a bar.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.474
- I don't really remember the name.
- You were at a bar?

03:45.055 --> 03:46.267
You said "we."

03:47.348 --> 03:48.808
- That's you and...?
- Kevin.

03:48.809 --> 03:50.310
I don't know
how much time we have

03:50.311 --> 03:51.651
- or what they plan to do.
- They?

03:51.652 --> 03:54.524
Is... is this about Kevin?
Is he okay?

03:54.525 --> 03:57.407
We haven't been able
to reach him for questioning.

03:57.408 --> 03:59.118
What does that mean?

03:59.119 --> 04:03.203
- Where is he?
- What... what the hell is this all about?

04:04.204 --> 04:06.457
Holden, what happened
outside the bar?

04:07.708 --> 04:09.169
In the parking lot?

04:15.005 --> 04:16.255
The bartender.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.048
He saw you exit the bar,
followed by Kevin.

04:20.050 --> 04:22.932
Kev...

04:22.933 --> 04:25.345
- He then heard
several gunshots.

04:25.346 --> 04:27.887
We have over a dozen
shell casings at the scene.

04:27.888 --> 04:31.190
- Okay, stop the tape.
- Tom, just let them do their job.

04:31.191 --> 04:34.524
Their job is to protect Holden,
not level accusations, Diane.

04:34.525 --> 04:37.276
- There was gunfire. No one is
accusing your son of anything.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.399
I'm not who you think I am!

04:39.400 --> 04:41.362
They grabbed him.

04:44.204 --> 04:45.825
- Who did?
- They started hitting him.

04:45.826 --> 04:47.116
Why didn't you say anything?

04:47.117 --> 04:48.708
Did you see their faces?

04:48.709 --> 04:50.119
I know who you are.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.412
No, it... it was too dark.

04:52.413 --> 04:54.083
Do you remember
anything physical?

04:54.084 --> 04:56.125
Height, hair color? Clothing?

04:56.126 --> 04:57.797
More importantly,
I know what you can do.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.629
No, I... it was too dark.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.971
What happened next?

05:01.972 --> 05:03.724
How did you get away?

05:13.484 --> 05:15.144
Holden, how did you get away?

05:15.145 --> 05:18.237
Holden, get in the car!

05:18.238 --> 05:21.200
All right, we're done here.

05:21.201 --> 05:24.655
That's enough.
We're done.

05:30.210 --> 05:32.502
Okay, well,
thanks again for your time.

05:32.503 --> 05:35.456
- If we have any follow-ups...
- Phone call will be sufficient, Sheriff.

05:36.917 --> 05:37.917
Okay.

05:39.169 --> 05:40.801
Thank you.
Have a good day.

05:46.306 --> 05:48.017
Don't worry.

05:48.018 --> 05:50.470
"Don't worry"? Were you even
listening in there?

05:50.471 --> 05:51.971
He's safe, all right?

05:51.972 --> 05:54.685
Whether he is safe,
he doesn't feel safe.

05:55.816 --> 05:57.357
Diane, let it go.

05:58.779 --> 06:02.823
Did all that really happen
outside the... the bar?

06:03.944 --> 06:05.104
What, you think I made it up?

06:06.156 --> 06:07.366
Maybe.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.159
Truth is I don't know you
well enough to know

06:10.160 --> 06:12.082
if that's something
you'd make up.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.255
But for what it's worth,
you know, I'd avoid any lie

06:16.256 --> 06:18.549
that causes Dad
to go into cardiac arrest.

06:20.461 --> 06:23.092
And I know technically
I'm still your kid brother,

06:23.093 --> 06:25.595
but, you know, technically
I've been doing this

06:25.596 --> 06:28.307
- longer than you have.
- This?

06:28.308 --> 06:31.270
Yeah, you know... life,

06:31.271 --> 06:32.973
existing out in the world.

06:35.516 --> 06:37.567
So if you ever need anything...

06:37.568 --> 06:39.318
Yeah.

06:39.319 --> 06:40.651
I need a ride.

06:41.782 --> 06:44.193
I don't usually rent
month-to-month.

06:44.194 --> 06:45.785
One year minimum.

06:45.786 --> 06:47.787
I can pay cash.

06:47.788 --> 06:49.369
You're not from here.

07:01.542 --> 07:03.212
No.

07:03.213 --> 07:05.596
So what brings you here?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.641
A boy.

07:11.642 --> 07:14.013
So why did you want
to come back here again?

07:14.014 --> 07:15.975
Maybe if I knew
what we were looking for,

07:15.976 --> 07:20.229
I could, like, you know,
help speed up the process.

07:20.230 --> 07:24.023
I missed 12 years.
You can't give me 10 minutes?

07:24.024 --> 07:26.195
Look, don't get me wrong, man.

07:26.196 --> 07:30.070
Bar parking lot at noon on a
Saturday is not without its thrills.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.076
You gotta be kidding.

07:37.077 --> 07:40.710
Seriously, there's a trash
can, like, six feet away,

07:40.711 --> 07:42.502
but God forbid
you have to behave

07:42.503 --> 07:44.384
like a functioning member
of society.

08:01.692 --> 08:05.065
Whoa, whoa, come on, man.
Get off my truck.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.197
Holden?

08:08.198 --> 08:10.200
What, you see something?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.615
Nothing.

08:15.616 --> 08:17.207
Let's go home.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.119
You okay?

09:00.120 --> 09:01.831
I'm fine.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.164
Rough night.

09:07.217 --> 09:09.169
Is that real?

09:11.171 --> 09:12.381
You bet.

09:12.382 --> 09:14.343
You a cop?

09:14.344 --> 09:16.345
Sure.

09:16.346 --> 09:18.058
Then where's your badge?

09:19.229 --> 09:20.560
I'm undercover.

09:25.736 --> 09:27.527
Would you like to hold it?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.284
Here.

09:39.790 --> 09:43.083
Jake, honey, come here.
Honey?

09:53.844 --> 09:56.846
So you do this every Sunday?

09:56.847 --> 09:59.428
For the past few years, yeah.

09:59.429 --> 10:03.022
Man, Mom took to church
like a duck to holy water.

10:03.023 --> 10:04.984
And Dad?

10:04.985 --> 10:06.856
Dad believes in two things...

10:06.857 --> 10:09.398
Air conditioning and
sleeping in on the weekends.

10:09.399 --> 10:12.862
He sees church as an affront
to his "core convictions."

10:12.863 --> 10:15.786
Wait, so Dad's not coming?

10:16.947 --> 10:18.118
I'm sure if you asked him...

10:19.159 --> 10:22.662
This is... I have no idea
what I'm doing.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.954
- I can't...
- Here, here.

10:24.955 --> 10:27.917
I got it.
Pop a squat.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.839
- Thanks.
- Come on.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.962
Hey, you know,
it's not so terrible...

10:32.963 --> 10:34.514
Church.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.517
You know, it makes Mom happy.

10:39.059 --> 10:42.061
And I kind of think
she likes being around others

10:42.062 --> 10:45.065
who don't have a clue
what it all means...

10:47.107 --> 10:50.570
but, you know,
aren't afraid to ask.

10:51.822 --> 10:53.322
- There you go.
- Hey.

10:53.323 --> 10:56.326
- That's pretty good.
- Boom. Yeah.

10:57.738 --> 10:59.578
So what's in it for you?

10:59.579 --> 11:01.581
You know, going to church?

11:03.704 --> 11:05.625
I go for the scenery.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.222
I like the scenery too.

12:13.153 --> 12:16.566
Hey. Who is that?
He looks familiar.

12:24.534 --> 12:26.206
Yeah, he should.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.418
That's Kevin's brother.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.132
The psycho that put you
in a coma?

12:36.046 --> 12:37.047
Jeff.

12:38.839 --> 12:41.881
The subject of rebirth,
of resurrection,

12:41.882 --> 12:45.224
appears again and again
throughout the Bible.

12:45.225 --> 12:48.387
But what is it
about the restoration of life

12:48.388 --> 12:51.311
that makes it such a prominent
and poignant theme?

12:53.023 --> 12:56.155
We are tremendously thrilled
and grateful

12:56.156 --> 12:58.818
to have with us today
someone who's experienced

12:58.819 --> 13:02.161
a rebirth of sorts...
A miracle.

13:02.162 --> 13:03.493
Holden Matthews.

13:05.205 --> 13:07.867
Holden has been granted
his second chance,

13:07.868 --> 13:10.119
along with his mother, Diane,

13:10.120 --> 13:11.670
his brother, Luke.

13:11.671 --> 13:16.255
Their patience, their
ardent belief in our Lord

13:16.256 --> 13:18.418
has not gone unrecognized.

13:21.011 --> 13:22.762
But the question remains...

13:24.134 --> 13:28.098
Ahem.

13:30.190 --> 13:32.561
But the question remains,

13:32.562 --> 13:35.064
even with the gift
of a second chance...

13:35.065 --> 13:37.146
When the hell
did you buy a phone?

13:37.147 --> 13:39.989
Just... just turn it off.

13:39.990 --> 13:43.282
The answer to that

13:43.283 --> 13:45.325
is found within your heart.

13:47.537 --> 13:50.119
- Sorry. No matter
where you come from,

13:50.120 --> 13:52.542
- where you are or where
you're going... Sorry.

13:54.254 --> 13:57.087
If the Lord lives within you...

14:11.021 --> 14:13.563
Remember, Holden.

14:17.817 --> 14:20.189
You have to remember.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.280
You have to remember.

14:21.281 --> 14:23.033
Leave me alone!

14:31.491 --> 14:34.203
It's okay, Holden.
Come back and sit down.

14:34.204 --> 14:35.205
Come on.

14:36.206 --> 14:38.088
You okay?
It's gonna be okay.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.370
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:11.371 --> 15:13.242
- You're home early.
- Yeah.

15:13.243 --> 15:17.166
I... I don't know if church
is really my thing.

15:17.167 --> 15:20.249
I don't know
if anyone's gonna blame you.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.132
Well, except, you know...

15:23.503 --> 15:25.505
Right.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.757
You got a second?

15:28.758 --> 15:30.850
There's something
I want to show you.

15:34.014 --> 15:37.056
What? No.

15:37.057 --> 15:39.358
Oh! Does it work?

15:39.359 --> 15:41.360
Well, not yet.

15:41.361 --> 15:43.562
Couple of replacement parts,

15:43.563 --> 15:47.697
some man hours. If anybody can
fix it, it's you, Holden.

15:50.370 --> 15:52.661
You saved all this?

15:52.662 --> 15:56.035
Of course I did.
I cannot count the many times

15:56.036 --> 15:59.538
I had to pull you away from that
thing just to get you to eat.

15:59.539 --> 16:02.961
That bike...
Hell, this whole garage...

16:02.962 --> 16:05.084
This was your church.

16:05.085 --> 16:08.297
You're a lot like me, son. We're
nuts-and-bolts kind of guys.

16:08.298 --> 16:11.090
We see something that needs
to be fixed, we fix it.

16:11.091 --> 16:14.763
Right? We don't sit around and pray
that it's going to fix itself.

16:14.764 --> 16:17.147
That's... that's crazy.

16:22.442 --> 16:24.363
Hey, Dad?

16:24.364 --> 16:26.025
You and Mom...

16:26.026 --> 16:28.368
You guys are okay, right?

16:31.911 --> 16:33.872
We're through the worst of it.

16:33.873 --> 16:35.325
That's all the matters, right?

16:36.786 --> 16:37.996
Yeah.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.499
All right, well, come on.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.001
Give me a hand.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.602
Come on.

17:05.815 --> 17:07.196
You have ID?

17:14.154 --> 17:14.993
Where's your car?

17:14.994 --> 17:17.996
Missus forgot
to get it serviced.

17:17.997 --> 17:19.459
It's not the first time.

17:24.874 --> 17:27.587
Mind if we move this along?
I've got an appointment.

17:31.010 --> 17:32.092
With Frost.

17:33.593 --> 17:34.763
Of course.

17:34.764 --> 17:37.557
We'll have a car escort you
up to the main house.

18:32.282 --> 18:35.033
Over the archway,
across the light.

18:35.034 --> 18:38.117
Deny the side of darkness
into the light.

18:57.217 --> 18:59.218
Think that'll do it.

18:59.219 --> 19:00.760
Okay.

19:01.811 --> 19:03.352
Start her up.

19:03.353 --> 19:04.724
See how we did.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.239
Your mom would kill me
if I didn't say, "Be careful,"

19:20.240 --> 19:21.911
so be careful.

19:47.477 --> 19:50.480
Are you crazy?

19:52.021 --> 19:53.363
Hey!

19:58.658 --> 20:00.280
Get away from me!

20:16.215 --> 20:19.178
What the hell's wrong with you?

20:25.144 --> 20:28.608
- Get in!
- Kevin?

20:54.714 --> 20:57.005
Why can't we talk in the truck?

20:57.006 --> 20:59.508
- They could be listening.
- Who?

20:59.509 --> 21:01.510
Who is listening?
We're in the middle of nowhere.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.221
Keep your voice down.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.723
Not until you tell me
what's going on.

21:04.724 --> 21:06.144
Damn it, Holden, shut up!

21:06.145 --> 21:08.147
No! You need to tell me
what's going on!

21:09.649 --> 21:11.891
- What are you?
- What?

21:12.852 --> 21:14.313
Kevin, I'm your friend.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.856
No, you... you were a
vegetable for 12 years.

21:17.857 --> 21:19.698
And now look at you.

21:19.699 --> 21:22.951
People don't just wake up from a
coma and walk out of the hospital.

21:22.952 --> 21:24.323
Kevin, you need to calm down.

21:24.324 --> 21:27.786
No, I know what I saw!
I know what I saw.

21:27.787 --> 21:31.249
They were right about you,
about what you could do.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.001
And now
they won't leave me alone

21:33.002 --> 21:35.754
until they have you.
I never asked for any of this.

21:35.755 --> 21:37.466
Neither did I!

21:37.467 --> 21:41.179
I didn't ask to live
half my life unconscious

21:41.180 --> 21:42.881
in a hospital bed.

21:42.882 --> 21:45.133
I didn't ask to do
whatever the hell it was

21:45.134 --> 21:47.265
you saw me do the other night.

21:47.266 --> 21:51.099
I certainly didn't ask to
be driven miles out of town

21:51.100 --> 21:53.392
by some ninja girl
from The Matrix

21:53.393 --> 21:56.776
who claimed we lived a life
together while I was in a coma.

21:57.987 --> 22:00.569
The only thing I asked for

22:00.570 --> 22:02.491
was help...

22:02.492 --> 22:05.614
Help from my best friend

22:05.615 --> 22:09.369
who shared beers with me
right up there, man.

22:11.751 --> 22:13.542
I just want things
to be like they were.

22:13.543 --> 22:16.045
I still want that.

22:18.458 --> 22:20.299
Well, it's too late
for that now.

22:25.174 --> 22:26.265
Then I'm sorry.

22:28.307 --> 22:30.850
I'm sorry I woke up
and ruined your life.

23:12.061 --> 23:13.892
You're back less than a week

23:13.893 --> 23:16.184
and Mom's already
got you doing chores?

23:16.185 --> 23:17.856
No wonder you're the favorite.

23:17.857 --> 23:19.568
Maybe it has something to do

23:19.569 --> 23:21.730
with you sneaking out
after Mom and Dad are asleep.

23:21.731 --> 23:23.442
Yeah, I'm in college, man.
You're sneaking.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.784
- I'm not sneaking, I...
- I get it.

23:25.785 --> 23:27.906
Mom runs this place
like Guantanamo.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.158
A little rebellion now and
then could be good for you.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.031
Then you must be
a pinnacle of health.

23:33.082 --> 23:36.034
Yeah.

23:36.035 --> 23:38.206
You should come with me.

23:38.207 --> 23:40.208
This girl Julia's
having a few friends over.

23:40.209 --> 23:42.130
You know, it's nothing major.

23:42.131 --> 23:45.634
- I... I don't think so.
- You sure, Holden?

23:45.635 --> 23:47.676
Maybe a little bit of practice
being around other people

23:47.677 --> 23:49.098
wouldn't be the worst thing.

23:50.349 --> 23:52.051
Come on, dude.

23:53.763 --> 23:55.314
You got a shirt I can borrow?

24:13.372 --> 24:15.033
A few friends?

24:15.034 --> 24:17.997
Okay, so I underestimated
a little.

24:19.168 --> 24:20.750
Welcome down the rabbit hole.

24:21.881 --> 24:23.171
Just try and keep up.

24:23.172 --> 24:24.253
Okay.

24:50.409 --> 24:52.410
Start with this.

24:52.411 --> 24:57.205
You're going to want to avoid
any reds, blues, or clears.

24:57.206 --> 24:59.207
There's gonna be punch
floating around.

24:59.208 --> 25:02.081
It's essentially Kool-Aid
with turpentine, so...

25:03.673 --> 25:06.546
- Guess who?
- Ooh.

25:11.971 --> 25:14.132
Sorry. Holden, uh...

25:14.133 --> 25:17.766
uh, this is my... Riley...

25:17.767 --> 25:19.227
Girlfriend, sorry.

25:19.228 --> 25:22.140
- Um, Riley, this is my brother...
- Brother?

25:22.141 --> 25:25.564
Yeah, I know. You're all
this town's talking about.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.195
So, do you remember anything
from your coma?

25:27.196 --> 25:30.318
Could you, like, hear people speaking
to you while you were unconscious?

25:30.319 --> 25:33.531
I saw a kid on YouTube that could
hear everything going on around him.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.995
This is a party, so could
we not talk about comas?

25:36.996 --> 25:39.208
Why are you drinking beer?

25:41.210 --> 25:43.042
It's a neutral color?

25:45.084 --> 25:48.006
Come on, I'm taking you
where we got the good stuff.

25:48.007 --> 25:51.169
It's cool.
I'll catch up with you.

25:51.170 --> 25:54.383
- I promise.
- Okay. Let's go, superstar.

26:18.247 --> 26:19.659
I'm meeting with Frost.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.961
- No, you're not.
- I think there's been a mistake.

26:22.962 --> 26:24.963
No, no mistake.

26:24.964 --> 26:26.965
You had a meeting with Frost.

26:26.966 --> 26:29.047
Now you have a meeting with me.

26:29.048 --> 26:31.920
- Sorry to waste your time.
- Please take your seat.

26:31.921 --> 26:34.212
You've got my number where
Frost can reach me directly.

26:34.213 --> 26:35.594
Sit down!

26:52.111 --> 26:54.033
What the hell were you thinking?

26:55.284 --> 26:57.035
You had orders to be discreet.

26:57.036 --> 27:00.538
Discretion is how this
organization continues to operate

27:00.539 --> 27:02.160
with minimal
outside interference.

27:02.161 --> 27:06.164
What you did... that was
the opposite of discreet.

27:06.165 --> 27:08.046
Frost instructed me
to find something out...

27:08.047 --> 27:10.959
And yet that moronic show and
tell wasn't the worst of it.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.552
Your blunt-force tactics have likely
spooked Holden, not that I blame him.

27:14.553 --> 27:17.135
He'll involve law enforcement...
If he hasn't already...

27:17.136 --> 27:21.139
And photos of you in that hideous...
mustard jacket

27:21.140 --> 27:25.564
will be posted on every bus bench
from Fort Reed to Fort Worth.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.107
You're being reassigned.

27:29.108 --> 27:30.568
You don't have
the authority to do that.

27:30.569 --> 27:33.071
Our cause is too important.
Holden is too important.

27:33.072 --> 27:35.533
His cooperation is crucial.

27:35.534 --> 27:39.197
And by alienating him,
you've jeopardized

27:39.198 --> 27:42.330
the life's work of a great man.

27:42.331 --> 27:44.662
I gave him proof!

27:44.663 --> 27:47.126
Frost wanted to see what the
kid can do and now we know.

27:49.378 --> 27:52.290
You don't get a gold sticker

27:52.291 --> 27:54.133
for a job half done.

28:02.802 --> 28:04.393
You can go now.

28:17.116 --> 28:18.908
Holden!

28:21.120 --> 28:23.992
If it's too strong,
I can add more lemonade.

28:23.993 --> 28:26.124
Hi, I'm Jamie.

28:26.125 --> 28:28.086
Holden.

28:28.087 --> 28:29.667
Yeah, I... I know.

28:29.668 --> 28:32.000
You see?
Everybody knows.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.172
Luke told us
not to say anything,

28:34.173 --> 28:37.926
but I feel like it's wrong
not to say anything. Right?

28:37.927 --> 28:40.098
Like when someone dies,

28:40.099 --> 28:42.720
you don't just ignore
the fact that they're dead.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.223
You acknowledge the fact
that they've lived.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.186
- I didn't die. I'm still...
- Obviously you didn't die,

28:48.187 --> 28:52.150
but just 'cause you're not dead
doesn't mean you were alive.

28:52.151 --> 28:57.066
Ignore her. She gets hammered and
then suddenly she's Aristotle.

28:58.277 --> 29:00.448
Uh, the philosopher.

29:00.449 --> 29:02.240
Yeah, don't forget scientist.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.862
You know, a lot of people
don't know this,

29:03.863 --> 29:05.533
but his model of the universe

29:05.534 --> 29:07.535
is actually what paved
the way for Copernicus,

29:07.536 --> 29:09.868
who, as most people do know, said
the earth revolved around the sun,

29:09.869 --> 29:11.080
not the other way around.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.044
I was really big into science.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.216
No kidding.

29:20.219 --> 29:23.341
Well, I'm really big into
keeping this party a party.

29:23.342 --> 29:26.094
So let's skip study hall for now

29:26.095 --> 29:28.938
and let's start having some fun.

29:32.191 --> 29:35.944
All right, bitches,
around the world.

29:35.945 --> 29:37.105
- Here we go.
- All right.

29:37.106 --> 29:38.737
- Yeah!
- Woo!

29:45.074 --> 29:46.956
- Woo!
- Good job, Riley.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.141
Oh yeah!

30:34.293 --> 30:37.125
You don't look like you were
in a coma for 12 years.

30:37.126 --> 30:40.128
You look like a quarterback.

30:40.129 --> 30:42.801
The miracles of modern medicine.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.094
Some miracle.

30:51.560 --> 30:54.272
I...
I really don't do this.

30:54.273 --> 30:57.275
I mean, make out with guys
I hardly know.

30:57.276 --> 31:00.069
I thought everyone knows me.

31:01.780 --> 31:02.821
Valid point.

31:07.656 --> 31:10.249
I've wanted this for so long.

31:23.462 --> 31:25.213
What?
What's the matter?

31:25.214 --> 31:28.386
I... nothing.
Um...

31:28.387 --> 31:29.928
Oh, we don't have to...

31:29.929 --> 31:32.811
No. No, I... I want to.

31:44.984 --> 31:49.157
Um, I gotta... where...
Where's the bathroom?

31:49.158 --> 31:51.990
There's... sorry,
I'll be right back.

31:51.991 --> 31:53.332
Holden?

32:07.136 --> 32:09.008
Don't resist.

32:19.648 --> 32:22.151
They're coming for you, Holden.

32:59.438 --> 33:00.809
Whoa.

33:05.364 --> 33:06.525
Where am I?

33:32.551 --> 33:35.054
Hey!

33:37.015 --> 33:38.137
Hello?

33:44.773 --> 33:46.644
- Hurry up, man!
- I gotta take a leak!

33:46.645 --> 33:48.857
Dude, did you fall in or what?

34:04.293 --> 34:05.714
- Hey.
- Hey!

34:07.836 --> 34:09.257
Where's Holden?

34:09.257 --> 34:10.838
What?

34:10.839 --> 34:14.473
My brother? I thought
you were watching him.

34:36.034 --> 34:38.034
- Come on, man!
- Let's do this!

34:38.036 --> 34:40.998
Woo!

34:40.998 --> 34:42.790
- Hey!
- Oh!

34:42.791 --> 34:45.042
Right over there!

34:45.043 --> 34:47.876
- Oh yeah!
- I love you!

35:09.148 --> 35:12.191
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

35:13.282 --> 35:16.155
Man! What's going on?

35:32.050 --> 35:34.012
Holden!

35:35.754 --> 35:38.717
Holden? Holden!

35:40.519 --> 35:41.970
Holden!

35:50.359 --> 35:52.109
Holden. Holden.

35:52.110 --> 35:55.072
Holden, come on.
Wake up.

35:55.073 --> 35:58.696
Wake up, come on.

35:58.697 --> 35:59.988
- It's okay.
- Luke.

36:01.240 --> 36:03.120
Come on,
we gotta get out of here.

36:03.121 --> 36:05.204
Okay, you gotta stand up.
I'll help you.

36:19.348 --> 36:20.798
I got you.

36:20.799 --> 36:23.351
I... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

36:23.352 --> 36:25.853
I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.

36:25.854 --> 36:26.935
What?

36:32.020 --> 36:35.733
Hey. Hey, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

36:35.734 --> 36:37.406
Let's go.

38:15.674 --> 38:17.875
- Daddy! Daddy!
- He-he-he-hey!

38:17.876 --> 38:20.338
Easy there, butterfly. You're
getting too strong for me.

38:20.339 --> 38:22.009
You know
what might have happened?

38:22.010 --> 38:24.221
I think you got bit
by some radioactive spiders.

38:24.222 --> 38:26.223
- No.
- Yeah, 'cause that's a spider bite.

38:26.224 --> 38:28.095
That's another spider bite.
There's another spider bite.

38:28.096 --> 38:30.187
- Lots of spider bites.
- Hey, I didn't hear you come in.

38:30.188 --> 38:31.188
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.482
- Pancakes are almost ready.
- I'm starved.

38:34.483 --> 38:36.774
Did you get taller
while I was gone?

38:36.775 --> 38:38.195
- No!
- I think you did.

38:38.196 --> 38:39.697
- No.
- No, I measured you before I left.

38:39.698 --> 38:42.741
You are definitely taller.
I have a tall girl!

38:44.112 --> 38:45.153
Oh, right there.

38:48.907 --> 38:50.248
The door was unlocked.

38:51.329 --> 38:54.081
Spent an entire weekend
installing that double cylinder,

38:54.082 --> 38:55.664
but if you
don't actually lock it...

38:57.125 --> 38:58.757
Did you talk to your supervisor?

39:01.630 --> 39:04.131
Wasn't that the whole reason
you made the trip?

39:04.132 --> 39:05.843
He got called away, last minute.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.226
Called away?
He invited you down.

39:09.388 --> 39:11.469
Did he at least apologize
and reschedule?

39:11.470 --> 39:13.431
He's the owner, Mel. He
didn't actually speak to me.

39:13.432 --> 39:15.473
- His assistant relayed the message.
- Great.

39:15.474 --> 39:17.474
Maybe you can ask his
assistant for that promotion.

39:18.687 --> 39:20.187
You need to be more aggressive.

39:20.188 --> 39:22.189
Emily starts
at Westover in the fall.

39:22.190 --> 39:23.651
That plus mortgage payments...

39:23.652 --> 39:25.403
I mean, maybe it's...
I don't know...

39:25.404 --> 39:27.575
Maybe you need
to try something new.

39:27.576 --> 39:30.198
A sales job that doesn't require
that you travel so much.

39:32.991 --> 39:35.954
Hello?

39:37.796 --> 39:39.046
Uh, just a moment.

39:39.047 --> 39:41.880
It's for you.
Mr. Frost?

39:44.132 --> 39:45.594
Yes, hello.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.057
No, no, it's quite all right.

39:51.269 --> 39:53.141
Absolutely.
I understand.

39:54.563 --> 39:56.685
No, no, thank you.

40:09.117 --> 40:13.200
Ah, he is risen.
Before noon, no less.

40:13.201 --> 40:14.492
You want me
to make you something?

40:14.493 --> 40:16.794
No thanks.
I'm not really hungry.

40:16.795 --> 40:19.206
You sleep okay?

40:19.207 --> 40:23.631
Yeah, fine.
Just, uh, weird dreams.

40:23.632 --> 40:27.174
Well, try and eat.
You'll feel better.

40:27.175 --> 40:29.176
Hey, Luke, you didn't happen
to know anyone

40:29.177 --> 40:30.679
involved in that house fire,
did you?

40:32.511 --> 40:33.851
House fire?

40:33.852 --> 40:36.393
Yeah, it happened right off-campus.
Just awful.

40:36.394 --> 40:38.686
I guess there was a party
and it got out of hand.

40:38.687 --> 40:40.688
Whole house went up in minutes.

40:40.689 --> 40:42.770
Three kids were taken
to the hospital.

40:42.771 --> 40:44.062
It's a miracle
nobody was killed.

40:45.323 --> 40:46.985
Yeah, that's crazy.

41:12.180 --> 41:13.592
Hi.

41:14.853 --> 41:16.224
Hi.

41:17.896 --> 41:19.016
Can I come in?

41:19.017 --> 41:20.398
Of course.

41:29.568 --> 41:31.028
You live here?

41:31.029 --> 41:34.201
I... I just mean,
you know,

41:34.202 --> 41:38.325
there's a lot of, uh,
empty space.

41:38.326 --> 41:40.038
I am still moving in.

41:53.722 --> 41:55.182
The other night,

41:55.183 --> 41:58.977
you, uh, said we lived
a life together.

42:00.398 --> 42:01.600
Yeah.

42:11.449 --> 42:12.571
Where?

42:13.305 --> 42:19.876
