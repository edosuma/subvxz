00:49.630 --> 00:51.440
HEY,CHIEF.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.730
VICTIM IS LISA MASON.

00:53.910 --> 00:55.880
SHE'S A 34-YEAR-OLD WHITE FEMALE.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.760
SHE'S ALSO THE WIFE OF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SCOTT MASON.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.730
THAT'S HIM OVER THERE.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.349
I UNDERSTOOD THE BODY WAS FOUND NAKED ON THE BEACH

01:04.519 --> 01:05.640
LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.920
HOW WAS SHE IDENTIFIED SO QUICKLY?

01:07.090 --> 01:09.630
THE KILLER THREW HER WALLET AND CLOTHES HERE,

01:09.770 --> 01:11.620
AND THE HARBOR DIVISION GOT HER DRIVER'S LICENSE.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.500
AND ONE OF THEIR FRIENDLY DETECTIVES CALLED MR. MASON?

01:14.650 --> 01:15.740
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.380
MASON'S A HEAVY HITTER IN THE D.A.'s MAJOR-CRIMES OFFICE.

01:19.540 --> 01:22.810
MAYBE THEY WERE THINKING A LITTLE PROFESSIONAL COURTESY.

01:26.550 --> 01:29.150
SO,WHY ARE Y'ALL UP HERE INSTEAD OF DOWN THERE?

01:29.300 --> 01:31.110
COMMANDER TAYLOR'S ORDERS.

01:31.270 --> 01:34.400
CHIEF JOHNSON, I'D LIKE TO SEE MY WIFE.

01:34.550 --> 01:35.210
PLEASE.

01:35.340 --> 01:38.060
MR. MASON,I'M TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS,

01:38.220 --> 01:40.060
BUT I KNOW THAT I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE

01:40.200 --> 01:41.500
WHO PROSECUTES MURDERS FOR A LIVING

01:41.640 --> 01:43.910
WHY YOU CAN'T GO DOWN THERE WITH ME.

01:44.050 --> 01:45.060
AND THOUGH I'VE NEVER MET YOUR WIFE,

01:45.220 --> 01:47.800
I'M CERTAIN THAT SHE WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE HER THIS WAY.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.290
IT WILL BE MUCH MORE HELPFUL TO US

01:49.450 --> 01:51.700
IF YOU WOULD GIVE US YOUR STATEMENT,PLEASE.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.020
MR. MASON,WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME,SIR,DOWNTOWN?

01:54.170 --> 01:55.810
WE'LL GET YOUR STATEMENT THERE.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.880
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:58.330 --> 02:01.040
Brenda: DETECTIVE DANIELS IS STILL AT THE HOMELAND SECURITY SEMINAR?

02:01.210 --> 02:02.650
FOR TWO MORE WEEKS.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.110
SO,THIS PLAN THAT YOU'VE HATCHED WITH CHIEF POPE

02:05.260 --> 02:08.430
MEANS WE CONTINUE SHORT-STAFFED.

02:08.990 --> 02:10.810
NEVER MIND.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.120
LET ME SEE WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN HERE.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.760
WHAT IS THE POINT OF KEEPING MOST OF MY SQUAD

02:25.910 --> 02:27.460
OUT OF THE CRIME SCENE?

02:27.610 --> 02:30.430
MY CALL -- I WANT TO KEEP THE CRIME SCENE SIMPLE

02:30.580 --> 02:32.470
AND AVOID ATTRACTING THE MEDIA.

02:32.630 --> 02:36.670
AND FRANKLY,THIS IS SOMETHING NOT EVERYONE NEEDS TO SEE.

02:45.870 --> 02:47.760
I THOUGHT SHE WASHED UP ON SHORE.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.790
Flynn: NOPE. DRY AS A BONE.

02:49.940 --> 02:53.700
AND YOU WON'T FIND ANY WATER IN HER LUNGS,EITHER.

02:58.550 --> 03:01.100
THESE RED MARKS --

03:01.240 --> 03:04.690
NOT THE CIGARETTE BURNS, BUT THE LITTLE DOTS --

03:04.850 --> 03:07.000
DID THE CORONER'S INVESTIGATOR SAY WHAT THEY MIGHT BE?

03:07.160 --> 03:09.520
THOSE RED DOTS ARE FROM A CATTLE PROD.

03:09.660 --> 03:10.670
THEY'RE ALL OVER HER BACK,TOO.

03:10.820 --> 03:15.180
UNFORTUNATELY,THEY ARE NOT LIMITED TO OUTSIDE HER BODY.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.980
THE KILLER USED HIS WEAPON --

03:17.140 --> 03:18.420
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL IT --

03:18.570 --> 03:22.980
TO SERIOUSLY DAMAGE HER ORGANS.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.350
THERE'S SOME OLD BRUISING HERE.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.370
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN MISSING?

03:31.510 --> 03:34.470
ACCORDING TO THE HUSBAND, JUST SINCE LAST NIGHT --

03:34.620 --> 03:37.590
DEAD BETWEEN 7 AND 10 HOURS.

03:40.340 --> 03:45.180
THERE'S SOME CHAFFING AROUND HER ANKLES...

03:45.700 --> 03:48.400
WRISTS,AND NECK.

03:48.550 --> 03:50.520
SHE WAS TIED UP.

03:50.820 --> 03:56.240
STANDING. TORTURED. AND STRANGLED.

03:57.080 --> 03:58.020
NO SIGN OF A GAG,

03:58.170 --> 04:03.130
SO THE KILLER EITHER WANTED TO HEAR HER SCREAM OR...

04:03.280 --> 04:04.520
SHE WAS ANESTHETIZED.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.630
SHE'S GONNA BE NEGATIVE FOR DRUGS,CHIEF.

04:06.860 --> 04:08.630
VICTIM FELT EVERYTHING.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.950
I GET THE IMPRESSION YOU'VE FOUND BODIES LIKE THIS BEFORE.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.990
IN 1998, THREE OTHER WOMEN

04:13.160 --> 04:16.050
WERE TORTURED AND STRANGLED TO DEATH IN THE SAME WAY.

04:16.209 --> 04:19.230
THREE DAYS APART,EACH ONE DUMPED IN A L.A.-COUNTY BEACH.

04:19.370 --> 04:22.340
THEN THE NEXT YEAR,THE SAME THING HAPPENED ALL OVER AGAIN.

04:22.500 --> 04:26.590
PRESS CALLED THE GUY WHO DID THIS THE "P.C.H. KILLER."

04:26.750 --> 04:31.240
P.C.H. -- PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY?

04:31.390 --> 04:34.050
MEDIA NICKNAME. THAT MUST HAVE FED HIS EGO.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.800
SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY WHO LIKES A LOT OF ATTENTION.

04:36.970 --> 04:40.000
WHICH I PREFER HE NOT GET TILL AFTER WE FIND HIM.

04:40.150 --> 04:42.140
THERE'S ONE MORE THING. LIEUTENANT.

04:42.290 --> 04:45.710
OH,YEAH,HE BRANDS EACH VICTIM ON THE HEEL

04:45.890 --> 04:47.600
IN THE ORDER IN WHICH HE KILLS THEM --

04:47.760 --> 04:51.100
ONE,TWO,THREE, WITH ROMAN NUMERALS.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.750
SO,TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.330
WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BEHIND.

05:23.340 --> 05:24.180
THANK YOU.

05:24.350 --> 05:26.570
HEY,CHIEF,WE HAVE ALL AVAILABLE AIR ASSETS

05:26.730 --> 05:29.100
UP AND FLYING OUR WAY.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.110
YEAH,WE'RE SEARCHING EVERY BEACH IN THE COUNTY.

05:31.270 --> 05:33.500
THE SECOND YOU FIND ANYTHING, LET ME KNOW.

05:33.790 --> 05:34.930
BYE.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.910
YOU'RE WELCOME.

05:39.650 --> 05:43.110
SO,IT SAYS HERE THAT IN THE PREVIOUS CASES,

05:43.250 --> 05:46.830
THE MURDERS WERE CONSIDERED PART OF A RAPE,

05:46.990 --> 05:50.200
BUT SEMEN WAS ONLY DISCOVERED ON THE BODIES,NOT IN THEM.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.520
HE'S A REAL PERVERT -- NOT A SURPRISE.

05:53.670 --> 05:58.290
SO HE TIES THEM UP SO THAT THEY FEEL HELPLESS...

05:58.460 --> 06:03.190
AND THEN NEUTERS THEM WITH AN ELECTRIC PROD...

06:03.790 --> 06:06.250
AND THEN BRANDS THEIR FEET.

06:06.410 --> 06:08.680
HE'S TRANSFORMING THEM FROM WOMEN TO CATTLE.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.630
AND HE'S A PSYCHO, ALSO NOT A BIG SHOCK.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.920
AND WHEN HE'S FINISHED WITH THEM...

06:14.080 --> 06:17.640
HE DUMPS THEM ON A PUBLIC BEACH,NAKED,

06:17.780 --> 06:21.780
INDICATING HE BELIEVES THEY DESERVE TO BE HUMILIATED

06:21.930 --> 06:23.690
FOR SOME REASON.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.130
DO WE KNOW WHY?

06:25.270 --> 06:28.110
NO IDEA, BUT ALL OF THESE WOMEN

06:28.270 --> 06:30.840
WERE INVOLVED IN LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS --

06:31.000 --> 06:34.550
THREE OF THEM WERE MARRIED AND THREE WERE ENGAGED.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.300
AND ALL OF THEM WERE MESSING AROUND WITH MEN

06:36.460 --> 06:38.040
OTHER THAN THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.820
AND ALL OF THEM WERE DIVORCED AT LEAST ONCE.

06:40.990 --> 06:43.360
WELL,THAT DOESN'T NARROW DOWN THE FIELD VERY MUCH,LIEUTENANT.

06:43.520 --> 06:47.650
WELL,THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON. MAYBE YOU'VE NOTICED.

06:47.780 --> 06:49.600
THEY'RE ALL PRETTY.

06:49.770 --> 06:51.990
WHICH MAKES ME THINK THAT SINCE THE WOUNDS

06:52.100 --> 06:54.530
WERE INFLICTED DURING THE MURDER AND THERE WERE NO DRUGS,

06:54.690 --> 06:57.050
THAT THE WOMEN WENT WITH HIM WILLINGLY.

06:57.190 --> 06:59.900
SO EVEN THOUGH OUR SERIAL KILLER'S A SEXUAL PERVERT --

07:00.050 --> 07:02.450
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ONE.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.070
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO ALL THE VICTIMS' EX-HUSBANDS?

07:05.240 --> 07:06.640
YEAH. DEAD ENDS.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.740
OR MAYBE I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO ASK THEM.

07:09.520 --> 07:12.210
YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO LISA MASON'S FIRST HUSBAND,TOO?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.190
YES.

07:14.810 --> 07:18.650
SO,THREE WOMEN IN NINE DAYS.

07:19.380 --> 07:21.890
HE MUST CHOOSE HIS VICTIMS IN ADVANCE.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.140
HOW DOES HE DO THAT, I WONDER?

07:24.220 --> 07:24.990
excuse

07:25.000 --> 07:28.140
I HATE TO SUGGEST IT, BUT I'VE ALWAYS FELT OUR KILLER

07:28.310 --> 07:30.960
MIGHT BE PART OF L.A. COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

07:31.370 --> 07:33.880
P.C.H. RUNS THROUGH AREAS

07:34.060 --> 07:36.230
SUPERVISED BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT,L.A.P.D.,

07:36.400 --> 07:39.070
SANTA MONICA,HUNTINGTON, LONG BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.120
SO BY LEAVING BODIES ON ALL THESE DIFFERENT BEACHES,

07:41.290 --> 07:43.640
HE'S CREATING CROSS-JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES,

07:43.790 --> 07:45.890
COUNTING ON SLOW COMMUNICATION.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.570
AND HE'S MANAGED TO DUMP SIX BODIES

07:47.740 --> 07:49.270
ALONG A WELL-TRAVELED HIGHWAY

07:49.440 --> 07:52.700
DURING TWO MASSIVE MANHUNTS WITHOUT BEING CAUGHT.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.720
Flynn: EVERY LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE COUNTY

07:54.870 --> 07:57.460
STILL HANDS THEIR CASES OVER TO THE SAME DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

07:57.630 --> 07:59.480
AND WE JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A DEPUTY D.A.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.910
WAITING IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM FOR YOU.

08:02.100 --> 08:05.290
AND THOUGH HIS WIFE DIDN'T COME HOME LAST NIGHT,

08:05.440 --> 08:09.720
MR. DEPUTY D.A. SCOTT MASON DIDN'T REPORT HER MISSING.

08:09.870 --> 08:12.250
SEEMS NEGLECTFUL.

08:12.380 --> 08:13.060
ALL RIGHT.

08:13.210 --> 08:14.900
THANK YOU,LIEUTENANT.

08:15.060 --> 08:17.330
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA, COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE MORGUE

08:17.490 --> 08:20.830
AND GET A PRELIM ON MR. MASON'S WIFE A.S.A.P.?

08:21.030 --> 08:23.940
AND,LIEUTENANT FLYNN, PLEASE SEND OUT A REQUEST

08:24.110 --> 08:26.280
FOR FOLLOW-UPS TO ALL REPORTS OF SCREAMING IN THE COUNTY

08:26.450 --> 08:28.660
OVER THE LAST WEEK.

08:28.820 --> 08:32.990
THESE WOMEN DIDN'T GO QUIETLY. THANK YOU.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.270
Mason: THE P.C.H. KILLER.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.330
WE THOUGHT HE WAS PROBABLY DEAD.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.730
UNFORTUNATELY,NO.

08:44.890 --> 08:47.230
I'M SORRY,MR. MASON.

08:47.390 --> 08:48.980
I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS THAT NEED ANSWERED

08:49.130 --> 08:51.090
AND IN A HURRY, BECAUSE,AS YOU MAY REMEMBER,

08:51.250 --> 08:52.260
THIS PARTICULAR GUY --

08:52.420 --> 08:53.210
MURDERS IN THREES.

08:54.170 --> 08:56.290
AND DUE TO OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS,

08:56.510 --> 08:58.960
I ONLY HAVE ABOUT 60 HOURS BEFORE THIS GUY'S GONNA KILL AGAIN.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.670
I FEEL A PARTICULAR OBLIGATION TO JUST JUMP RIGHT IN HERE.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.830
SO,UM... IS THERE A REASON

09:05.980 --> 09:08.360
THAT YOU FAILED TO REPORT YOUR WIFE MISSING

09:08.530 --> 09:11.460
WHEN SHE DIDN'T COME HOME LAST NIGHT?

09:12.150 --> 09:15.050
WE LIVE IN ECHO PARK, AND SHE WORKS ON THE WESTSIDE.

09:15.200 --> 09:19.320
SHE SOMETIMES STAYS OVERNIGHT AT HER SISTER'S IN SANTA MONICA.

09:19.490 --> 09:21.880
LAST NIGHT, SHE CALLED ME TO SAY

09:22.030 --> 09:23.400
THAT SHE WAS TOO TIRED TO DRIVE HOME.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.260
AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SPOKE WITH HER?

09:25.420 --> 09:27.030
YES.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.490
YES, THAT WAS THE LAST TIME.

09:29.660 --> 09:31.140
SINCE YOU SEEM TO KNOW A BIT ABOUT

09:31.280 --> 09:33.620
THIS SO-CALLED P.C.H. KILLER'S M.O. --

09:33.780 --> 09:35.190
NOT THAT MUCH,REALLY.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.320
ALL THAT INFORMATION WAS PRETTY CAREFULLY HANDLED.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.040
OH.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.000
THEN YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT HE TENDS TO CHOOSE WOMEN

09:43.160 --> 09:44.690
THAT ARE DIVORCED.

09:44.850 --> 09:46.360
WHICH WOULD FIT.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.770
LISA LEFT HER FIRST HUSBAND ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.720
OKAY.

09:52.890 --> 09:55.750
ANOTHER CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VICTIMS --

09:56.160 --> 09:59.810
THEY WERE ALL STRAYING OUTSIDE THEIR PRIMARY RELATIONSHIPS.

09:59.980 --> 10:02.610
SO,ARE YOU AWARE,OR DO YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE,

10:02.760 --> 10:04.070
THAT YOUR WIFE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR?

10:04.210 --> 10:06.530
NO. NO,SH--

10:06.690 --> 10:08.330
LISA WOULD NEVER DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.650
AND CAN YOU ACCOUNT FOR YOUR OWN WHEREABOUTS LAST NIGHT,SIR?

10:11.810 --> 10:15.710
I WAS AT HOME,BY MYSELF.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.770
OKAY.

10:18.930 --> 10:21.290
JUST ONE LAST THING --

10:21.470 --> 10:24.530
IN ORDER TO FIND THE LUNATIC THAT DID THIS TO YOUR WIFE,

10:24.700 --> 10:26.230
I NEED YOU TO SIGN THIS CONSENT FORM

10:26.390 --> 10:27.710
ALLOWING US TO SEARCH YOUR HOUSE.

10:27.870 --> 10:30.140
SEARCH MY HOUSE? FOR WHAT?

10:30.290 --> 10:32.460
E-MAILS ON COMPUTERS, PHONE RECORDS,

10:32.630 --> 10:34.500
APPOINTMENT BOOKS -- FRANKLY, ANYTHING THAT'LL HELP --

10:35.080 --> 10:38.130
NO,NO. WHY WOULD I AGREE TO THAT?

10:39.600 --> 10:41.400
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T AGREE,SIR,

10:41.660 --> 10:43.780
I'M LEAVING THIS ROOM TO CALL THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

10:43.940 --> 10:46.700
TO INFORM HIM THAT A DEPUTY IN HIS MAJOR-CRIMES OFFICE

10:46.870 --> 10:49.070
IS STANDING BETWEEN ME AND A SERIAL KILLER.

10:49.230 --> 10:51.650
AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

10:51.790 --> 10:54.170
THAT I WILL NOT PERMIT THIS INVESTIGATION TO BE COMPROMISED

10:54.320 --> 10:56.570
BY YOUR AFFILIATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

10:56.730 --> 10:58.280
THERE IS A WOMAN'S LIFE AT STAKE HERE.

10:58.510 --> 11:01.000
DO NOT TEST ME ON THIS, SIR.

11:01.390 --> 11:03.690
SIGN THE CONSENT FORM.

11:04.350 --> 11:06.430
EXCUSE ME.

11:08.830 --> 11:10.740
WE FOUND THE FIRST VICTIM.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.370
ON WHICH BEACH?

11:12.610 --> 11:15.940
NOT ON THE BEACH. COUNTY MORGUE.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.060
THREE AND A HALF DAYS AGO, HOMICIDE INVESTIGATORS

11:24.210 --> 11:25.190
FROM THE L.A. SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

11:25.350 --> 11:27.120
BROUGHT HER IN FROM MALIBU BEACH.

11:27.290 --> 11:30.040
DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T CALL YOU.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.030
HER FACE IS UNRECOGNIZABLE.

11:35.190 --> 11:37.490
THAT'S ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO BODIES.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.850
YOUR MURDERER SMASHED IN OUR JANE DOE'S FACE

11:40.010 --> 11:41.320
WITH A BLUNT INSTRUMENT --

11:41.480 --> 11:43.340
BROKE HER CHEEK BONES, KNOCKED OUT SOME TEETH.

11:43.530 --> 11:45.110
JANE DOE?

11:45.340 --> 11:47.550
DIDN'T THEY FIND HER I.D. AND CLOTHES ON THE BEACH?

11:47.720 --> 11:48.740
THAT'S THE OTHER DISSIMILARITY.

11:48.890 --> 11:51.750
THIS VICTIM WAS DUMPED WITHOUT HER PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.370
BUT IN ADDITION TO THE SEMEN, CIGARETTE BURNS,

11:54.530 --> 11:58.990
AND PROD MARKS, WHICH MATCH LISA MASON'S BODY...

11:59.800 --> 12:02.620
THERE'S ALSO THIS.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.910
IT'S THE SAME KILLER.

12:07.080 --> 12:11.400
OKAY,EXACTLY WHEN AND WHERE DID THE SHERIFFS FIND HER?

12:13.170 --> 12:16.600
OKAY,WE NEED TO GET WHOEVER THIS DEPUTY SLADE GUY IS

12:16.770 --> 12:19.820
INTO POPE'S OFFICE RIGHT NOW.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.110
THIS LOOKS A LOT MORE PERSONAL.

12:22.270 --> 12:23.830
Slade: SO, THIS JANE DOE WE FOUND,

12:24.010 --> 12:25.790
RAN HER PRINTS THROUGH AFIS, NO HIT.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.390
DIDN'T HAVE A NAME OR EVEN A FACE,REALLY,

12:28.560 --> 12:30.820
TO CHECK WITH MISSING-PERSONS REPORTS.

12:31.000 --> 12:31.540
SO I WENT OUT ON MY OWN

12:31.690 --> 12:34.470
AND HAD A PLASTIC SURGEON HELP US TO CONSTRUCT THIS --

12:34.500 --> 12:36.890
A COMPUTER-GENERATED PORTRAIT.

12:37.350 --> 12:39.140
AND DID YOU IDENTIFY HER?

12:39.310 --> 12:41.660
Slade: NO,BUT WE'VE HAD PEOPLE KNOCKING ON EVERY DOOR

12:41.830 --> 12:43.500
IN MALIBU WITH THAT PICTURE.

12:43.660 --> 12:45.410
I TOOK IT TO BARS AND RESTAURANTS. NOBODY KNOWS HER.

12:45.580 --> 12:49.210
MY PARTNER AND I WERE ROOKIES DURING THE PREVIOUS MURDERS.

12:49.370 --> 12:51.180
THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY WE COULD HAVE KNOWN THE SIGNIFICANCE --

12:51.340 --> 12:53.490
WHAT ABOUT ENTERING THE MURDER INTO VICAP?

12:53.650 --> 12:56.890
Taylor: FELLAS,I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GOT HERE

12:57.070 --> 12:59.080
AS MUCH AS HOW WE MOVE ON.

12:59.230 --> 13:01.440
I AGREE. IN MY OPINION -- AND IF YOU THINK THE SHERIFF

13:01.590 --> 13:04.380
WILL HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THIS, DEPUTY SLADE,PLEASE SPEAK UP --

13:04.520 --> 13:07.140
INVESTIGATING THESE MURDERS SEPARATELY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

13:07.310 --> 13:08.950
WE AGREE. WE AGREE.

13:09.110 --> 13:10.270
IN FACT,I WAS TOLD, IF YOU WANT HER,

13:10.430 --> 13:12.340
WE CAN HAND OFF OUR JANE DOE TO YOU,

13:12.510 --> 13:14.040
INCREASE OUR PATROLS ALONG THE P.C.H.,

13:14.210 --> 13:16.220
AND COORDINATE WITH THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS.

13:16.370 --> 13:18.180
EXCEPT ALL THAT WAS DONE LAST TIME.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.930
THE KILLER TURNS OUR EXTRA SURVEILLANCE

13:21.100 --> 13:22.580
ALONG THE P.C.H. TO HIS ADVANTAGE,

13:22.760 --> 13:24.420
SO IT'S EITHER NOT ENOUGH OR IT'S TOO MUCH.

13:24.590 --> 13:26.520
AND THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS

13:26.690 --> 13:28.910
IF WE CONCENTRATE OUR RESOURCES ON THE HIGHWAY,

13:29.080 --> 13:30.810
BY THE TIME THE KILLER GETS TO THE BEACH,

13:30.980 --> 13:32.830
HE'LL HAVE TORTURED AND MURDERED ANOTHER WOMAN,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.420
AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE.

13:34.590 --> 13:37.380
BUT IF A HIGHLY VISIBLE FORCE GETS OUT ON THE ROAD

13:37.540 --> 13:39.470
AND IF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HELPS US MAKE IT CLEAR

13:39.640 --> 13:42.020
THAT WE ARE SPARING NO RESOURCES HERE,

13:42.190 --> 13:45.700
MAYBE THIS NUTJOB WILL BACK OFF UNTIL WE CAN FIND HIM.

13:46.670 --> 13:49.150
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.

13:49.310 --> 13:51.180
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW...

13:51.660 --> 13:53.390
WE'VE GOT ABOUT 48 HOURS LEFT

13:53.550 --> 13:56.280
BEFORE HE'S SUPPOSED TO KILL AGAIN.

13:56.590 --> 13:58.880
Fritz: NO I.D. YET FROM THIS COMPUTER-GENERATED PHOTO,

13:59.080 --> 14:01.510
SO I'VE SCOURED THE DIFFERENT COUNTY POLICE DEPARTMENTS

14:01.680 --> 14:04.050
FOR THEIR SHORT-TERM MISSING LISTS --

14:04.190 --> 14:06.530
WOMEN BETWEEN 19 AND 45.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.330
NOW,THESE AREN'T FULL REPORTS YET,

14:08.520 --> 14:10.010
BUT ONE OF THEM MIGHT HIT THE MARK.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.310
JUST CROSS-CHECK THESE

14:12.470 --> 14:14.330
WITH THE ONES I'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.100
Brenda: SO,OUR KILLER IS STRONG ENOUGH

14:17.260 --> 14:18.650
TO CARRY THE BODIES DOWN THE HILL

14:18.810 --> 14:21.230
AND SMART ENOUGH TO COVER HIS TRACKS.

14:21.390 --> 14:24.560
WHO WOULD BE THAT FAMILIAR WITH THE COUNTY BEACHES?

14:24.590 --> 14:25.840
I WISH I KNEW,CHIEF.

14:26.010 --> 14:29.830
DRIVES ME CRAZY I NEVER GOT THIS GUY. CRAZY.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.750
THIS CATTLE PROD IS LIKE THE ONE USED BY OUR KILLER.

14:33.930 --> 14:35.830
IT'S NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO SPREAD THE ELECTRIC SHOCK

14:36.000 --> 14:38.390
THROUGH THE ENTIRE BODY LIKE A STUN GUN,OKAY?

14:38.540 --> 14:41.010
IT'S DESIGNED TO HURT, NOT KILL.

14:41.220 --> 14:44.350
AND YOU CAN ORDER THIS ONLINE.

14:50.350 --> 14:52.710
LET'S CALL THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THIS THING

14:52.870 --> 14:56.240
AND HAVE THEM SEND US THEIR CUSTOMER DATABASE.

14:56.410 --> 14:59.360
AND THIS BATTERY PACK --

15:00.460 --> 15:02.150
LET'S SEE HOW LONG IT'S GOOD FOR.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.190
MAYBE OUR GUY JUST ORDERED A FEW MORE.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.860
WELL,I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING,CHIEF,

15:08.040 --> 15:10.840
DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY MASON

15:11.000 --> 15:15.660
HAS GOT A VERY INTERESTING...CLOSET.

15:18.230 --> 15:23.490
ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT VIBRATE AND...GLOW IN THE DARK.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.010
AND LISA MASON NEVER SET FOOT

15:26.200 --> 15:27.330
IN HER SISTER'S HOUSE YESTERDAY.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.760
AND SHE HASN'T SPENT A NIGHT THERE IN OVER FIVE MONTHS,

15:29.920 --> 15:32.740
SO THAT PART OF MASON'S STORY DOESN'T HOLD UP.

15:32.910 --> 15:34.400
DID YOU NOTICE IF D.D.A. MASON

15:34.560 --> 15:36.350
HAD A LOT OF SUNBLOCK IN HIS HOUSE?

15:36.510 --> 15:38.550
I DIDN'T THINK TO LOOK. WHY?

15:38.720 --> 15:41.430
HE'S NOT VERY TAN,IS HE?

15:44.300 --> 15:49.700
HOW WOULD MASON KNOW THE COUNTY BEACHES WELL ENOUGH

15:49.870 --> 15:53.700
TO DROP OFF THE BODIES IN EIGHT DIFFERENT PLACES?

15:54.070 --> 15:55.920
THAT KIND OF KNOWLEDGE WOULD PUT SOME COLOR IN YOUR CHEEKS,

15:56.090 --> 15:58.030
WOULDN'T IT?

15:58.800 --> 16:00.330
I THINK WE HAVE A MATCH!

16:00.490 --> 16:02.620
THE JANE DOE FROM THE MORGUE.

16:02.810 --> 16:04.820
TAMMY REYNOLDS.

16:04.990 --> 16:07.150
YEAH,HER BOSS CALLED ABOUT HER TWO DAYS AGO.

16:07.290 --> 16:09.780
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BACK AT WORK ON MONDAY,

16:09.940 --> 16:11.580
NOT OFFICIALLY MISSING YET.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.480
SHE COULD STILL BE ON VACATION WITH HER HUSBAND,

16:13.640 --> 16:17.000
WHO'S NAME IS ROBERT -- ROBERT REYNOLDS.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.870
Brenda: ON VACATION? WHERE?

16:19.030 --> 16:19.790
DOESN'T SAY.

16:19.950 --> 16:23.850
ROBERT REYNOLDS -- 38,HAS A CONDO IN SANTA MONICA,

16:23.870 --> 16:27.250
A BOAT IN THE MARINA,COUPLE OF DRUG ARRESTS IN THE '90s.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.410
HAS ANYONE REPORTED MR. REYNOLDS MISSING?

16:29.570 --> 16:32.000
UH,CAN'T TELL FROM HERE.

16:33.240 --> 16:35.690
LET ME LOOK INTO IT.

16:37.010 --> 16:38.900
I GUESS HE'S HANDSOME.

16:39.090 --> 16:40.960
IS IT ODD THAT THE KILLER STARTED UP AGAIN

16:41.120 --> 16:43.960
AFTER EIGHT YEARS BY OFFING HIS OWN WIFE?

16:44.120 --> 16:46.140
WELL,IT LOOKED A LOT MORE PERSONAL. I DON'T KNOW.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.270
DO YOU WANT TO SPLIT UP?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.870
F.B.I. WILL TAKE THE CONDO. YOU GUYS TAKE THE MARINA.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.480
YES,THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.990
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,COULD YOU PLEASE GET US A SEARCH WARRANT

16:54.150 --> 16:55.920
FOR MR. REYNOLDS' BOAT?

16:56.100 --> 16:57.270
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ, SERGEANT GABRIEL,

16:57.440 --> 16:59.650
I'M GONNA WANT SOME BACKUP WHEN WE GET TO THE MARINA.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.050
LIEUTENANT TAO, NOW THAT WE HAVE THEM,

17:01.210 --> 17:03.510
LET'S START LOOKING THROUGH LISA MASON'S COMPUTER FILES,

17:03.670 --> 17:06.349
MAYBE SHE MET MR. REYNOLDS ONLINE.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.300
AND,UH,LIEUTENANT FLYNN,

17:08.460 --> 17:10.550
IF YOU COULD DO SOME BACKGROUND WORK ON TAMMY REYNOLDS,

17:10.700 --> 17:13.440
SEE IF SHE FITS THE PROFILE OF OUR OTHER VICTIMS.

17:13.460 --> 17:15.000
thank you

17:40.450 --> 17:42.160
HEY.

17:42.350 --> 17:44.780
I KNOW YOU'RE EXHAUSTED AND THIS IS IMPORTANT,

17:44.950 --> 17:46.330
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT DONE BY 1:00 THIS AFTERNOON,

17:46.510 --> 17:47.570
YOU'RE STILL GONNA HAVE TO DELEGATE FOR AN HOUR

17:47.740 --> 17:49.100
SO WE CAN MAKE THAT FOLLOW-UP WITH YOUR DOCTOR.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.680
YES,YES,I KNOW.

18:06.330 --> 18:07.540
Delaney: AS SOON AS YOU SHOW ME THAT WARRANT,

18:07.700 --> 18:08.770
I'LL BE HAPPY TO LET YOU PASS.

18:09.010 --> 18:12.250
IF I COULD SEE IF MR. REYNOLDS IS ONBOARD HIS BOAT...

18:12.420 --> 18:14.060
THE REYNOLDS HAVEN'T BEEN HERE SINCE LAST SATURDAY

18:14.230 --> 18:16.560
WHEN THEY TOOK THE BOAT OUT, A LITTLE SUNSET TOUR.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.640
HARDLY WORTH ALL THIS FUSS.

18:18.810 --> 18:22.130
IT'S NOT A FUSS. IT'S A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.990
EXCUSE ME,SIR.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.050
PLEASE,MR. REYNOLDS BROUGHT HIS BOAT

18:27.230 --> 18:28.840
BACK FROM VACATION AND THEN TOOK IT OUT AGAIN?

18:29.020 --> 18:30.960
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ON VACATION SINCE LAST YEAR.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.300
YOU MAYBE HAVE THE WRONG BOAT ANYWAY,HUH?

18:33.460 --> 18:36.620
HELLO,DANNY,HOW YOU DOING? COME ON THROUGH.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.460
YOU'RE LETTING EVERYONE IN BUT US. EVERYONE.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.380
CHIEF.

18:43.560 --> 18:44.750
OH.

18:44.930 --> 18:47.650
HERE IS MY LEGAL AUTHORITY.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.040
NOW STEP ASIDE,SIR.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.320
MOVE!

18:51.480 --> 18:52.860
THANK YOU.

19:01.190 --> 19:04.530
EXCUSE ME,SIR. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:04.900 --> 19:07.890
I -- I GOT AN ORDER TO STRAIGHTEN UP THE BOAT.

19:08.060 --> 19:09.560
WHAT ORDER? WHEN?

19:09.740 --> 19:11.610
MR. REYNOLDS CALLED ME SUNDAY AFTERNOON,

19:11.790 --> 19:13.730
SAID HE CUT HIMSELF CLEANING FISH,

19:13.880 --> 19:15.650
WANTED ME TO SEE IF I COULD CLEAN THE BLOOD OFF HIS DECK.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.350
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT. THANK YOU,SIR.

19:19.010 --> 19:19.990
BLOOD.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.170
CLEAR!

19:45.230 --> 19:47.650
??????

20:12.760 --> 20:15.500
THERE'S MORE BLOOD IN THE SINK.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.060
NOBODY HERE,CHIEF.

20:25.820 --> 20:27.640
THERE WAS.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.330
WE FOUND SOME TEETH.

21:07.670 --> 21:09.030
I'M SENDING THEM TO THE MORGUE

21:09.210 --> 21:15.010
TO SEE IF THEY MATCH TAMMY REYNOLDS' MOUTH?

21:17.920 --> 21:19.980
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, CHIEF?

21:20.150 --> 21:23.400
I'M THINKING I UNDERSTAND WHY NO ONE HEARD THE VICTIMS SCREAM.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.530
THEY'RE DYING OUT THERE, LIEUTENANT.

21:27.680 --> 21:31.400
WE'VE BEEN CONCENTRATING ON THE WRONG INITIAL IN P.C.H.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.330
OUR KILLER DOESN'T BRING THE VICTIMS DOWN FROM THE HIGHWAY.

21:34.510 --> 21:37.400
HE'S SWIMMING THEM IN FROM THE PACIFIC.

21:37.660 --> 21:40.430
WHERE IS ROBERT REYNOLDS?

21:40.580 --> 21:42.330
I MEAN,AT THIS POINT,

21:42.540 --> 21:44.740
WE'RE MOVING INTO A MANHUNT, AREN'T WE?

21:44.880 --> 21:46.650
THERE'S STILL ANOTHER VICTIM TO THINK ABOUT,LIEUTENANT.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.470
I DON'T WANT TO FIND THAT GUY CARTING ANOTHER DEAD WOMAN AROUND.

21:52.220 --> 21:55.000
I HAVE TO GO FOR A BIT.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.150
WHILE I'M ON MY WAY BACK TO THE MURDER ROOM,

21:58.310 --> 22:00.970
I WANT TO HAVE THIS BOAT TAKEN APART.

22:01.110 --> 22:04.290
WE'RE LOOKING FOR FLOATATION DEVICES AND OXYGEN TANKS.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.530
GET SOME DIVERS IN HERE, TOO.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.560
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THIS THING.

22:08.900 --> 22:11.830
I WANT THAT BLOOD TESTED FOR TYPE.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.220
AND I WANT THOSE RESULTS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

22:16.790 --> 22:19.030
THANK YOU,LIEUTENANT.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.040
YES,MA'AM.

22:21.700 --> 22:22.970
Dr. Dioli: BASED ON YOUR LABS,

22:23.140 --> 22:27.640
I HAVE A PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS OF EARLY ONSET MENOPAUSE

22:27.800 --> 22:30.540
AND ALL THE SUFFERING THAT GOES WITH THAT --

22:31.380 --> 22:35.100
HOT FLASHES,CRAMPS, WEIGHT GAIN,

22:35.280 --> 22:39.250
ALSO WATER RETENTION, FOLLOWED BY NIGHT SWEATS,

22:39.420 --> 22:43.360
PREMATURE WRINKLING, AND MOOD SWINGS.

22:43.660 --> 22:46.960
OH,BUT...THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPENING.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.040
I'M ABOUT 100 YEARS TOO YOUNG.

22:49.210 --> 22:53.340
YES,YOU ARE SEVERAL YEARS BELOW THE AVERAGE AGE.

22:53.510 --> 22:55.940
BUT YOU'RE NOT IN CONTROL OF YOUR BODY.

22:56.110 --> 22:58.560
AND IN YOUR CASE, IT MAY BE GENETIC.

22:58.730 --> 23:01.300
HAVE YOU EVER ASKED YOUR MOTHER WHEN SHE WENT THROUGH --

23:01.440 --> 23:02.630
NO.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.840
WELL,MAYBE YOU SHOULD GIVE HER A CALL.

23:05.990 --> 23:07.490
TODAY,I FEEL FINE.

23:07.660 --> 23:10.780
YES,AND IF YOU'RE LUCKY,YOU'LL HAVE LOTS OF DAYS LIKE THAT.

23:10.940 --> 23:12.140
I DON'T.

23:12.290 --> 23:15.490
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN THREE YEARS, AND I KEEP A FAN IN MY PURSE.

23:15.640 --> 23:18.820
SO,IF IT'S NOT GENETIC,WHY ELSE WOULD THIS BE HAPPENING?

23:18.990 --> 23:19.950
WELL,THAT'S THE QUESTION.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.990
I'VE FOUND THAT EARLY ONSET MENOPAUSE

23:22.180 --> 23:24.550
IS SOMETIMES ONLY A SYMPTOM OF ANOTHER ILLNESS.

23:24.710 --> 23:27.000
AND WE SHOULD LOOK TO SEE WHAT THAT MIGHT BE,YES?

23:27.170 --> 23:28.480
WELL,YEAH,ABSOLUTELY.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.930
SO,WE'LL TAKE SOME MORE BLOOD TODAY,

23:31.100 --> 23:34.180
AND THEN I'LL SEE WHEN WE CAN SCHEDULE YOU FOR A SONOGRAM.

23:34.310 --> 23:36.520
W-W-WAIT,WAIT,WAIT.

23:37.360 --> 23:41.640
IF YOU MEAN... A SYMPTOM OF SOMETHING ELSE,

23:41.810 --> 23:44.820
DO YOU MEAN LIKE -- LIKE CANCER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

23:44.960 --> 23:47.150
THAT'S NOT THE FIRST THING THAT LEAPS TO MIND.

23:47.330 --> 23:50.000
IT CAN ALSO BE OVARIAN FAILURE

23:50.150 --> 23:53.000
OR A VIRAL INFECTION THAT MIGRATED TO YOUR ORGANS.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.500
I-I CAN'T KNOW.

23:54.690 --> 23:56.960
SO LET'S SCHEDULE YOU FOR THE SONOGRAM

23:57.120 --> 23:58.480
AND SEE WHERE THAT LEADS US, OKAY?

23:58.630 --> 23:59.660
THAT WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU.

23:59.880 --> 24:02.460
I'LL BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES.

24:13.930 --> 24:17.350
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING IN ROBERT REYNOLDS' CONDO?

24:19.260 --> 24:23.150
SOME OF THE SAME LEATHER GEAR MASON HAD,BUT NO BLOOD.

24:23.530 --> 24:26.570
HEY,COME ON. HEY. [ CRYING ]

24:26.740 --> 24:27.950
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.510
[ Sobbing ] NO,I'M NOT.

24:29.670 --> 24:33.620
I'M GONNA BE OLD AND WRINKLED AND RETAIN WATER AND --

24:33.780 --> 24:37.820
HEY,LISTEN. HOLD ON.

24:39.530 --> 24:42.530
LOOK,I WAS PLANNING ON DOING THIS AT DINNER TONIGHT.

24:43.030 --> 24:45.630
I THINK IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE ROMANTIC,

24:45.800 --> 24:47.050
BUT...

24:48.160 --> 24:51.000
CHANCES ARE YOU'RE STILL GONNA BE WORKING.

24:52.160 --> 24:55.250
AND THIS DAMN THING DOESN'T REALLY FIT IN MY POCKET.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.750
WHAT DAMN THING?

24:59.450 --> 25:02.770
I KNOW IN YOUR HEART YOU'RE A BIT OF AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.870
SO...

25:20.690 --> 25:23.320
YOU SEE,UH...

25:25.090 --> 25:26.170
I'VE ARRIVED AT THAT PLACE

25:26.320 --> 25:29.430
WHERE I CAN'T IMAGINE LIFE WITHOUT YOU.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.880
AND,UH...

25:32.030 --> 25:34.090
LET ME JUST SAY...

25:35.490 --> 25:37.600
I LOVE YOU

25:38.350 --> 25:41.690
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD.

25:42.150 --> 25:45.500
AND,BRENDA, WILL YOU MARRY ME,PLEASE?

25:45.660 --> 25:48.480
[ Sobbing ] YOU'RE ONLY ASKING ME 'CAUSE YOU FEEL SORRY FOR ME.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.490
NO,I DON'T. NOT AT ALL.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.400
yes,you do

25:50.460 --> 25:52.910
I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. I AM NOT BEING NICE.

25:53.070 --> 25:55.780
YOU ARE THE WOMAN I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR MY WHOLE LIFE.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.930
AND I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU WHEN YOU'RE MOST VULNERABLE

25:58.100 --> 26:00.370
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO SAY YES.

26:00.530 --> 26:03.130
SO PLEASE SAY YES.

26:07.580 --> 26:10.430
OH,IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

26:19.630 --> 26:22.940
IS IT OKAY IF I KEEP MY OWN NAME?

26:23.110 --> 26:25.780
OF COURSE.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.850
WELL...I GUESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE

26:31.000 --> 26:32.570
ANY BETTER SENSE THAN TO ASK ME,

26:32.710 --> 26:35.590
I GUESS I BETTER MARRY YOU.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.230
BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE THE GUY I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR,TOO.

26:39.430 --> 26:41.840
AND HERE WE ARE.

26:41.990 --> 26:44.750
WE FOUND EACH OTHER.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.670
we found each other

27:17.610 --> 27:19.060
Gabriel: UH,CHIEF?

27:19.220 --> 27:21.800
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA'S STILL WAITING FOR THE DIVERS DOWN AT THE MARINA,

27:22.000 --> 27:24.600
BUT I HAVE D.D.A. MASON IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM IF YOU'RE READY.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.900
IF YOU COULD JUST BABYSIT HIM FOR A MOMENT.

27:27.060 --> 27:28.090
OKAY.

27:30.570 --> 27:31.510
GOOD WORK,CHIEF.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.580
WE HAVE EVERYONE LOOKING FOR REYNOLDS.

27:33.740 --> 27:35.740
INCLUDING THE COAST GUARD SINCE YOU MADE IT CLEAR

27:35.900 --> 27:38.270
THAT HE'S MURDERING THESE WOMEN AT SEA.

27:38.530 --> 27:42.510
BUT D.D.A. MASON DOESN'T HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE ON THE WATER

27:42.680 --> 27:45.770
AND HE'S ONE OF US AND HE JUST LOST HIS WIFE,

27:45.960 --> 27:48.450
SO I WONDER IF QUESTIONING HIM NOW IS A GOOD USE OF OUR TIME.

27:48.610 --> 27:50.190
IT IS.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.060
I KNOW EVERY LAW-ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THE COUNTY

27:53.230 --> 27:55.810
IS LOOKING FOR OUR KILLER, BUT SO IS SOMEONE ELSE.

27:55.980 --> 27:56.450
WHO?

27:56.620 --> 27:57.640
HIS NEXT VICTIM.

27:57.810 --> 27:58.960
AND SHE MAY HAVE ALREADY FOUND HIM.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.390
AND WHAT MAKES YOU THINK MASON CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT?

28:01.570 --> 28:03.260
THE WOMAN'S SIZES IN HIS LEATHER GEAR

28:03.430 --> 28:06.190
AND THE PREVIOUS BRUISING ON HIS WIFE'S BODY.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.590
EXCUSE ME.

28:20.690 --> 28:23.640
TAMMY REYNOLDS WAS DEFINITELY DIVORCED LAST YEAR.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.280
MARRIED REYNOLDS SIX MONTHS AGO.

28:25.430 --> 28:27.120
PICTURES OF REYNOLDS WE GOT OFF THE INTERNET.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.330
HE POSTED THEM HIMSELF.

28:28.490 --> 28:30.060
IT MIGHT BE HOW HE MET HIS VICTIMS --

28:30.250 --> 28:33.430
LIKES ATTENTION,PERVERT, AND TAN.

28:34.890 --> 28:37.270
HAS ANYONE REPORTED MR. REYNOLDS MISSING?

28:37.430 --> 28:39.500
NO,BUT HE DIDN'T DISAPPEAR RIGHT AWAY.

28:39.650 --> 28:41.740
MADE A FEW CALLS AFTER HIS WIFE'S MURDER --

28:42.060 --> 28:43.290
ONE CALL TO HIS OFFICE,

28:43.460 --> 28:45.950
ONE TO THE BOAT-MAINTENANCE GUY FOR THE CLEANING,

28:46.110 --> 28:47.830
AND ONE TO THE RESTAURANT WHERE HIS WIFE WORKED.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.430
I HAVE THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES

28:49.590 --> 28:52.060
OF LISA AND TAMMY'S EX-HUSBANDS.

28:52.220 --> 28:54.650
LISA'S LIVES IN LONDON -- JEREMY SOMETHING --

28:54.810 --> 28:58.590
AND TAMMY'S EX HAS A SMALL BUSINESS ON PACIFIC STREET,

28:58.770 --> 29:01.300
LUCAS D. JONES.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.620
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO CALL THEM?

29:02.780 --> 29:04.090
NO. THANK YOU,LIEUTENANT.

29:04.270 --> 29:05.960
WE MAY BE NOTIFYING THEM OF A DEATH,

29:06.140 --> 29:08.620
WHICH WE HAVE TO DO IN PERSON WHEN WE HAVE THE TIME.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.520
[ CELLPHONE RINGS ] SORRY.

29:10.690 --> 29:11.920
YES,LIEUTENANT?

29:12.090 --> 29:15.310
THE BLOOD IN THE CABIN CORRESPONDS TO TAMMY'S TYPE.

29:15.460 --> 29:19.410
AND,UH,THE MORGUE MATCHED THE TEETH WE FOUND TO HER MOUTH.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.770
So that's done.

29:20.930 --> 29:24.030
Now,the blood on the deck may be male.

29:24.200 --> 29:28.040
UH,HOLD ON,LIEUTENANT. HOLD ON.

29:30.670 --> 29:31.480
OKAY.

29:31.640 --> 29:34.920
SO IT LOOKS LIKE REYNOLDS AND HIS WIFE HAD A DOMESTIC DISPUTE,

29:35.080 --> 29:37.350
WHICH PUSHED THE GUY BACK INTO PSYCHO MODE.

29:37.510 --> 29:41.620
IF IT'S REYNOLDS, WHERE DID HE KILL LISA MASON?

29:41.800 --> 29:44.070
HE HADN'T BEEN BACK TO THE MARINA SINCE SATURDAY.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.540
DOES HE HAVE ANOTHER BOAT SOMEWHERE?

29:45.720 --> 29:47.000
NOT REGISTERED.

29:47.150 --> 29:48.400
And what have the divers found?

29:48.550 --> 29:49.830
THEY HAVEN'T GOT HERE YET.

29:49.980 --> 29:51.640
HAVE THEY COME ACROSS ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE HELPED

29:51.790 --> 29:54.390
MR. REYNOLDS GET HIS WIFE TO SHORE COMPLETELY DRY,

29:54.550 --> 29:56.390
like a rubber raft or a body bag?

29:56.550 --> 29:59.130
NO. NO.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.360
YOU WANT ME TO LOOK AROUND

30:00.530 --> 30:02.710
AND SEE IF HE BORROWED ANY OF THAT STUFF FROM SOMEONE?

30:02.880 --> 30:05.470
YES,LIEUTENANT, AND LOOK VERY HARD,PLEASE,

30:05.630 --> 30:07.790
BECAUSE I'M WORRIED WE MAY BE LOOKING FOR THE WRONG MAN.

30:07.970 --> 30:10.270
YOU GOT IT,CHIEF.

30:21.750 --> 30:26.130
CHIEF JOHNSON,I WANT YOU TO TELL ME <i>EXACTLY</i> WHY I'M HERE.

30:26.290 --> 30:28.510
OBVIOUSLY,MY WIFE WAS MURDERED BY A SERIAL KILLER.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.960
AND FROM WHAT MY FRIENDS IN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE TELL ME,

30:31.130 --> 30:34.660
<i>THE FIRST VICTIM DIED</i>  <i>WHEN I WAS IN SACRAMENTO.</i>

30:35.630 --> 30:38.930
MR. MASON,OUR SEARCH WARRANT PRODUCED EVIDENCE

30:39.090 --> 30:40.550
INDICATING THAT YOU AND YOUR WIFE

30:40.680 --> 30:43.140
SHARED A LESS TRADITIONAL VIEW OF MARRIAGE

30:43.280 --> 30:44.080
THAN THE AVERAGE COUPLE.

30:44.260 --> 30:48.450
OKAY. NONE OF THAT STUFF IS ILLEGAL TO HAVE OR TO BUY.

30:48.620 --> 30:50.180
YES,BUT THE AMOUNT OF THAT STUFF

30:50.350 --> 30:52.700
INDICATES MORE THAN SIMPLE EXPERIMENTATION.

30:52.860 --> 30:54.520
AND FROM THE WOMAN'S SIZES, I HAVE TO ASSUME

30:54.680 --> 30:57.920
THAT YOUR WIFE SHARED YOUR INTERESTS,YES?

30:58.360 --> 31:00.440
LOOK,SIR, IN LESS THAN 39 HOURS,

31:00.600 --> 31:02.580
ANOTHER WOMAN COULD BE FOUND NAKED,TORTURED,

31:02.740 --> 31:04.120
AND STRANGLED TO DEATH ON A BEACH.

31:04.300 --> 31:05.930
I AM TRYING TO STOP THAT FROM HAPPENING.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.960
AND AS AN OFFICER OF THE COURT AND THE HUSBAND OF THE VICTIM,

31:09.120 --> 31:12.470
IT IS YOUR DUTY TO HELP ME.

31:13.030 --> 31:17.260
NOW,THERE ARE OLD BRUISES ON YOUR WIFE'S BODY,

31:17.430 --> 31:19.820
YET SHE WAS ONLY ABDUCTED TWO NIGHTS AGO.

31:19.970 --> 31:23.390
SO I NEED TO KNOW WHERE THOSE BRUISES CAME FROM.

31:23.860 --> 31:26.260
ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF DOMESTIC ABUSE?

31:26.410 --> 31:28.550
YOU KNOW I'M NOT.

31:28.710 --> 31:30.230
I'LL REPHRASE.

31:30.410 --> 31:31.800
WERE YOU AND YOUR WIFE INTO S&M?

31:31.970 --> 31:35.040
OKAY,YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M -- I'M...

31:39.980 --> 31:42.340
ALL RIGHT,YES,WE WERE.

31:42.490 --> 31:43.570
HOW DOES THAT HELP YOU?

31:43.740 --> 31:46.540
BECAUSE I WONDER IF THIS ATTITUDE THAT Y'ALL HAVE

31:46.700 --> 31:50.060
TOWARDS SEX INCLUDED, AS THE VICTIMOLOGY SUGGESTS,

31:50.220 --> 31:52.960
PARTNERS OUTSIDE YOUR MARRIAGE.

31:53.110 --> 31:54.840
I ASKED YOU THAT QUESTION BEFORE,SIR,

31:55.010 --> 31:57.010
BUT THIS TIME, I NEED A MORE TRUTHFUL ANSWER.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.720
AND THIS WILL REALLY HELP? YES,SIR.

32:01.260 --> 32:02.600
OKAY.

32:02.750 --> 32:05.570
YES,WE HAD AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP.

32:05.730 --> 32:06.310
IS THAT ENOUGH?

32:06.490 --> 32:08.800
NO. I NEED TO KNOW IF YOU EVER MET ANY OF THE MEN

32:08.970 --> 32:10.480
WITH WHOM YOUR WIFE WAS HAVING SEX.

32:10.670 --> 32:12.910
NO,NOT MET.

32:13.070 --> 32:15.280
THEN CAN YOU DESCRIBE THEM? EXCUSE ME?

32:15.440 --> 32:19.020
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT KIND OF MAN YOUR WIFE IS ATTRACTED TO?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.770
<i>PHYSICALLY?</i>  <i>DID SHE HAVE A TYPE?</i>

32:20.940 --> 32:22.750
SHE'S TRYING TO GET AN I.D. ON REYNOLDS,

32:23.670 --> 32:25.300
FIGURE OUT HOW HE MET LISA MASON.

32:25.460 --> 32:27.550
IT'S A LEGITIMATE LINE OF QUESTIONING,CHIEF.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.390
<i>I DIDN'T WANT TO POST</i>  <i>MY PICTURE ON THE INTERNET</i>

32:30.560 --> 32:31.030
<i>AND NEITHER DID SHE.</i>

32:32.520 --> 32:35.940
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU WANT HERE

32:36.130 --> 32:39.850
WITHOUT RUINING MY WIFE'S REPUTATION AND MINE?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.500
SHE WAS THE VICTIM HERE,RIGHT?

32:41.650 --> 32:44.010
I-I'M VERY SORRY.

32:44.190 --> 32:45.840
BUT THIS IS NOT A JUDGMENT OF YOUR LIFESTYLE.

32:46.010 --> 32:48.260
IT IS A HURRIED AND DIFFICULT INQUIRY

32:48.410 --> 32:51.370
INTO HOW THE KILLER AND YOUR WIFE MAY HAVE...

32:51.540 --> 32:53.530
FOUND EACH OTHER.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.930
SO,IF YOU DIDN'T MEET PEOPLE ONLINE,

32:56.100 --> 33:00.360
I'M ASSUMING THAT Y'ALL WENT TO A BAR OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

33:01.740 --> 33:05.730
MY WIFE AND I BELONG TO A PRIVATE CLUB CALLED THE VERGE.

33:05.890 --> 33:11.220
IT'S A SPACE ORGANIZED FOR THESE KIND OF...ENCOUNTERS.

33:11.370 --> 33:14.060
LOOK, IT WAS JUST SEX,OKAY?

33:14.160 --> 33:16.030
I LOVED LISA, AND LISA LOVED ME.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.610
I DON'T DOUBT IT.

33:19.340 --> 33:21.850
C-CAN YOU TELL ME IF YOU EVER NOTICED

33:22.020 --> 33:25.510
WHAT KIND OF MAN ATTRACTED YOUR WIFE'S ATTENTION?

33:25.670 --> 33:28.150
<i>'CAUSE ONE OF THOSE MEN</i>  <i>MAY HAVE BEEN HER KILLER,</i>

33:28.310 --> 33:30.820
<i>AND YOU MAY HAVE SEEN HIM,SIR,</i>  <i>JUST IN PASSING.</i>

33:30.970 --> 33:33.820
<i>I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED</i>  <i>IN ANYONE WITH ACCESS TO BOATS</i>

33:34.010 --> 33:35.930
OR SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE L.A. COASTLINE.

33:36.110 --> 33:39.010
WHAT,DO YOU THINK SHE TALKED TO THEM ABOUT GEOGRAPHY?

33:39.190 --> 33:41.100
MAYBE YOU HEARD A NAME. ROBERT REYNOLDS --

33:41.250 --> 33:46.270
NAMES?! THERE ARE NO NAMES,OKAY?

33:46.830 --> 33:49.760
ALL RIGHT,YOU WANT EVERY DARK DETAIL. HERE YOU GO.

33:49.910 --> 33:53.590
SHE LIKED REALLY FIT GUYS IN THEIR MID-30's TO MID-40's.

33:53.750 --> 33:55.670
MILITARY TYPES WERE A BIG PLUS.

33:55.850 --> 33:58.090
AND SHE WAS INTO GETTING TIED UP,WHICH DIDN'T INTEREST ME,

33:58.260 --> 34:01.190
SO SOMETIMES SHE WENT TO THE VERGE ON HER OWN.

34:01.350 --> 34:03.540
THEY HAVE A SPECIAL NIGHT FOR BONDAGE.

34:03.720 --> 34:07.000
SO YOU AND YOUR WIFE HAD SEX AT THE CLUB?

34:07.170 --> 34:09.730
IT'S A SEX CLUB.

34:10.310 --> 34:13.150
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE DID?

34:13.580 --> 34:17.370
SO,THIS SEX CLUB,THE VERGE, HAS OVER 6,000 MEMBERS,

34:17.520 --> 34:19.480
ALMOST 2,000 OF WHOM ARE FEMALE.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.880
NOW,YOU'RE NOT GONNA EVEN HAVE TIME TO FIND THEM ALL,

34:22.030 --> 34:23.060
LET ALONE TALK TO THEM.

34:23.239 --> 34:26.130
SOME OF THESE WOMEN ARE FROM OUT OF TOWN AND WILL BE SINGLE.

34:26.300 --> 34:29.190
ALL OUR VICTIMS ARE DIVORCED AND FROM L.A. COUNTY,

34:29.310 --> 34:30.590
SO IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME

34:30.750 --> 34:32.550
THAT THE KILLER'S NEXT VICTIM WILL FIT THIS PROFILE.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.310
WE'VE ALREADY GOT AN ALL-OUT MANHUNT

34:34.469 --> 34:36.310
IN PROGRESS FOR THIS ROBERT REYNOLDS --

34:36.489 --> 34:38.750
THE AREA BEACHES,THE HIGHWAYS, ALL THE LOCAL MARINAS.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.670
WE ARE STRAINING THE LIMITS OF WHAT COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN DO.

34:41.830 --> 34:44.159
BUT OBVIOUSLY,THE KILLER IS CHOOSING HIS VICTIMS IN ADVANCE,

34:44.300 --> 34:47.250
AND THE VERGE COULD HELP HIM DO THAT.

34:47.409 --> 34:48.969
NOW,WE KNOW THAT REYNOLDS WAS A MEMBER.

34:49.150 --> 34:50.590
AND BASED ON THAT INFORMATION,

34:50.730 --> 34:53.870
WE'VE INCLUDED THE VERGE ON THE LIST OF PLACES WE'RE WATCHING. AND THAT'S IT.

34:54.030 --> 34:55.520
BUT WE ARE  <i>ONLY</i> CONCENTRATING

34:55.670 --> 34:57.570
ON ONE SIDE OF THIS SEARCH OPERATION.

34:57.730 --> 34:59.060
LOOKING FOR THE KILLER IS IMPORTANT,

34:59.200 --> 35:01.010
BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO FIND THE WOMAN

35:01.160 --> 35:02.410
THAT HE IS ABOUT TO MURDER.

35:02.570 --> 35:04.860
NOW,IF YOU WOULD JUST LET ME HAVE SOME EXTRA PEOPLE

35:05.020 --> 35:06.590
TO CONTACT THE WOMEN ON THIS LIST --

35:06.730 --> 35:09.020
WE DON'T HAVE ANY EXTRA PEOPLE.

35:09.170 --> 35:12.250
I SAID,"THAT'S IT."

35:12.420 --> 35:13.290
I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO TALK

35:13.450 --> 35:14.870
TO THE EX-HUSBANDS OF THE OTHER VICTIMS.

35:15.060 --> 35:17.990
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.290
ALL RIGHT,FINE.

35:25.940 --> 35:28.650
PARDON ME,SIR.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.360
Flynn: CHIEF. YES.

35:38.720 --> 35:39.710
SO,NOW WHAT,CHIEF?

35:39.870 --> 35:42.830
WELL,I GUESS I'LL TALK TO TAMMY REYNOLDS' EX,

35:43.000 --> 35:44.730
THIS LUCAS D. JONES,

35:44.890 --> 35:47.180
WHILE I'M STILL ALERT ENOUGH TO DRIVE,

35:47.350 --> 35:49.820
AND SEE IF HE CAN TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T ALREADY KNOW.

35:49.990 --> 35:52.220
MEANWHILE,I WANT YOU AND THE REST OF THE SQUAD

35:52.380 --> 35:54.660
TO START CALLING ALL THE WOMEN ON THAT LIST FROM THE VERGE,

35:54.860 --> 35:58.680
BUT DISCRETELY,DISCRETELY START WARNING THEM.

35:58.760 --> 35:59.820
WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN, CHIEF.

35:59.980 --> 36:02.080
THANK YOU,LIEUTENANT.

36:02.250 --> 36:05.180

37:29.410 --> 37:32.210

I SAID, I NEED BACKUP AT 3740--

39:16.120 --> 39:19.220
AAH!

40:00.160 --> 40:02.740
WHERE'S MR. REYNOLDS' CELLPHONE?

40:03.110 --> 40:08.040
DID YOU USE ONE OF THOSE BOATS YOU WERE REPAIRING TO MURDER LISA MASON?

40:08.200 --> 40:11.090
ARE THERE ANY OTHER VICTIMS WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

40:32.400 --> 40:34.520
CHIEF.

40:37.730 --> 40:41.050
IT'S FROM LIEUTENANT FLYNN.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.640
"REMEMBER,CHIEF, WHEN RECOVERING FROM SHOCK,

40:43.810 --> 40:47.100
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP YOUR LEGS ELEVATED."

40:47.280 --> 40:48.300
[ LAUGHS ] FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.000
WELL,FLYNN'S A CLASS ACT.

40:50.190 --> 40:52.370
OW. OW.

40:54.610 --> 40:55.810
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO HEAR ALL THIS?

40:55.990 --> 40:59.110
YES. JUST SUMMARIZE.

40:59.550 --> 41:01.550
ALL RIGHT.

41:02.740 --> 41:06.170
DANNY'S FATHER WAS A LONG BEACH POLICE OFFICER,

41:06.330 --> 41:09.370
MOTHER...AN EXOTIC DANCER.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.600
SHE DIVORCED THREE TIMES.

41:11.780 --> 41:15.660
DANNY WENT INTO THE NAVY AT 17,BOAT MECHANIC,

41:15.830 --> 41:17.780
EVENTUALLY TRIED TO BECOME A S.E.A.L.

41:17.940 --> 41:20.660
LET ME GUESS -- HE FAILED THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.890
HE DID. ARE YOU SURPRISED?

41:23.020 --> 41:24.820
[ Sarcastically ] VERY. GO ON.

41:24.850 --> 41:28.040
SO,IN 1998, HE COMES TO L.A.,

41:28.200 --> 41:29.940
BECOMES A FREELANCE BOAT MECHANIC,

41:30.100 --> 41:32.320
KILLS A LOT OF PEOPLE,

41:32.490 --> 41:35.160
THEN MARRIED A GIRL NAMED TAMMY.

41:35.330 --> 41:37.130
SHE DIVORCED HIM LAST YEAR

41:37.290 --> 41:40.740
AND REMARRIED ROBERT REYNOLDS SIX MONTHS AGO.

41:40.790 --> 41:43.870
AND DANNY JONES REVERTS,

41:44.040 --> 41:46.820
JOINS THE VERGE WITH A FAKE I.D.,

41:46.990 --> 41:50.040
AND -- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

41:50.850 --> 41:54.590
MR. JONES SHOULD BE TELLING ME THIS,NOT YOU.

41:55.730 --> 41:56.410
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY UPSET

41:56.560 --> 41:57.940
YOU DIDN'T GET A CONFESSION FROM THIS GUY?

41:58.100 --> 42:00.920
I GOT HIM BY LUCK.

42:01.550 --> 42:04.460
KILLING SOMEONE'S NOT MY IDEA OF CLOSING A CASE ANYWAY.

42:04.630 --> 42:07.410
THE LUCKY THING IS YOU GOT HIM BEFORE HE GOT YOU.

42:07.570 --> 42:11.600
AND ONE OTHER THING -- TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THAT.

42:14.150 --> 42:14.870
WHO'S THAT?

42:15.030 --> 42:16.180
MELINDA TRENT.

42:16.350 --> 42:18.810
AND TONIGHT, SHE HAD A DATE WITH DANNY JONES,

42:18.970 --> 42:20.610
WHO SHE MET AT THE VERGE.

42:20.780 --> 42:24.070
THEY WERE GOING ON A SUNSET SAIL.

42:24.240 --> 42:27.010
YOU KEPT THAT GUY FROM KILLING SOMEONE.

42:27.180 --> 42:32.790
AND YOU WERE RIGHT... ABOUT EVERYTHING.

42:33.130 --> 42:35.520
MELINDA TRENT.

42:35.780 --> 42:38.360
REMEMBER THAT NAME.

42:41.770 --> 42:42.930
YOU KNOW WHAT?

42:42.960 --> 42:44.210
WHAT?

42:47.000 --> 42:53.190
I'M SO GLAD NOT TO BE DATING EVER AGAIN.

42:53.700 --> 42:59.030
I MEAN, REALLY...REALLY GLAD.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.030
OW. AH.

43:06.350 --> 43:07.460
DOES THAT HURT?

43:07.650 --> 43:09.180
NO.

43:10.420 --> 43:11.110
DOES THAT?

43:11.270 --> 43:12.370
NO.
