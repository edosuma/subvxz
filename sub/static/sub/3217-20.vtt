00:02.127 --> 00:04.043
Dad wants us to pick up where he left off:

00:04.212 --> 00:05.879
Saving people, hunting things.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.048
The family business.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.219
Goodnight, love.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.595
Hey, Dean.

00:13.763 --> 00:14.763
- Daddy.
Hey, buddy.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.101
Sammy.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.439
Mary.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.947
This is my girlfriend, Jessica.

00:32.115 --> 00:35.117
So here's to Sam
and his awesome LSAT victory.

00:35.285 --> 00:38.287
- What would I do without you?
- Crash and burn.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.084
No!

00:44.586 --> 00:46.628
- I'm not gonna ditch the job.
- Screw the job.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.922
I'm sick of the job anyway.
We don't get paid.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.508
We don't get thanked.
The only thing we get's bad luck.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.351
- Yeah?
- There's a cop car outside.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.395
You think it's for us?
I don't know.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.023
I don't see how. We ditched the plates,
the credit cards.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.942
They're leaving. False alarm.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.904
See, nothing to worry about.
- Yeah, being fugitives...

01:12.072 --> 01:14.156
- ...is a frigging dance party.
Hey, man...

01:14.324 --> 01:15.783
...chicks dig the danger vibe.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.535
You got anything?
Are you kidding? How could I?

01:18.703 --> 01:20.662
You got me sifting through,
like, 50 square miles.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.499
- That's where the victims disappeared.
- I got diddlysquat.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.627
- What about you?
- Just one thing. I'm pretty sure of it now.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.171
- We're hunting a jinn.
- A frigging genie?

01:29.339 --> 01:32.007
- You think these suckers can grant wishes?
I don't know.

01:32.175 --> 01:35.844
They're powerful enough. But not exactly
like Barbara Eden in harem pants.

01:36.012 --> 01:38.263
Jinn have been feeding off people
for centuries.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.474
- They're all over the Koran.
My God.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.143
Barbara Eden was hot, wasn't she?

01:43.311 --> 01:45.229
Way hotter than that Bewitched chick.

01:45.396 --> 01:46.647
Are you even listening to me?

01:47.398 --> 01:49.525
Ahem. Yeah.
So where do the jinns lair up?

01:49.692 --> 01:52.486
Ruins, usually. The bigger, the better.
More places to hide.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.364
I saw a place a few miles back.
I'm gonna go check it out.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.532
Come pick me up first.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.034
No. I'm sure it's nothing.
I just wanna take a look around.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.666
- Dean?
- Sam.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.126
What's going on?
- I don't know where I am.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.836
What? What happened?

04:15.004 --> 04:17.547
- Well, the jinn, it attacked me.
The gin?

04:17.714 --> 04:20.509
- You're drinking gin?
No, ass-hat, the jinn.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.511
The scary creature, remember?

04:22.679 --> 04:26.181
It put its hand on me and then I woke up
next to some hot chick.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.391
Who, Carmen?

04:27.558 --> 04:29.184
- Who?
Dean, you're drunk.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.811
- You're drunk-dialing.
I'm not.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.521
- Quit screwing around.
It's late.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.023
All right, just get some sleep.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.651
- I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- Wait, Sam. Sam.

04:53.668 --> 04:54.668
Lawrence?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.091
What the hell?

05:01.259 --> 05:02.801
Honey?

05:03.177 --> 05:04.886
What are you doing up?

05:05.054 --> 05:06.305
Hey.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.015
Carmen.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.183
Carmen, uh, I just, uh--

05:10.351 --> 05:13.228
- Oh, you can't sleep, huh?
- Yeah. Ha-ha.

05:13.396 --> 05:17.524
Well, why don't you come back to bed
and let's see if I can do anything to help?

05:18.943 --> 05:20.610
Sure.

05:20.778 --> 05:24.281
- Yeah, in a minute. You go ahead.
- Okay.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.658
- Don't stay up too long.
- No.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.686
Dean.

06:37.647 --> 06:38.647
Mom?

06:41.317 --> 06:43.485
What are you doing here?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.363
Are you all right?

06:47.490 --> 06:50.659
- I don't know.
- Well, come inside.

06:54.247 --> 06:58.417
Carmen just called
and said you just took off all of a sudden.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.503
Carmen?

07:02.046 --> 07:03.422
Right.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.466
Let me ask you a question.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.387
When I was a kid, what did you always
tell me when you put me to bed?

07:10.555 --> 07:12.806
- Dean, I don't understand--
- Just answer the question.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.144
I told you angels
were watching over you.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.693
I don't believe it.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.695
Oh!

07:30.324 --> 07:32.909
Honey, you're scaring me.

07:33.244 --> 07:37.497
- Now, just tell me what's going on.
- You don't think that wishes can really--?

07:38.166 --> 07:39.541
What?

07:40.084 --> 07:41.877
- Forget it.
Oh!

07:42.587 --> 07:43.920
Forget it. I'm just, uh--

07:44.380 --> 07:46.923
I'm happy to see you, that's all.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.722
You're beautiful. Ha.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.223
What?

07:59.562 --> 08:00.562
Hey, when I was, uh--

08:00.730 --> 08:02.481
When I was young,
was there ever a fire here?

08:02.648 --> 08:04.566
No, never.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.693
I thought there was.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.908
I guess I was wrong.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.542
Dad's on a softball team?

08:25.421 --> 08:28.381
Dad's softball team. It's--

08:28.549 --> 08:29.591
That's funny to me.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.969
He loved that stupid team.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.097
Dad's dead?

08:38.808 --> 08:40.602
And the thing that killed him was a--

08:41.520 --> 08:43.270
A stroke.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.650
He died in his sleep, you know that.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.110
- That's great.
- Excuse me?

08:50.363 --> 08:54.824
That's great.
That he went peacefully, I mean, it--

08:55.451 --> 08:57.577
It sure beats the alternative.

09:00.873 --> 09:01.915
You've been drinking.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.292
No, I haven't. Mom.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.420
I'm just gonna call Carmen
and have her come pick you up, okay?

09:07.588 --> 09:09.798
Wait. No. Don't do--
Don't do that. Don't do that.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.010
- I wanna stay here.
- Why?

09:14.804 --> 09:17.430
Because I miss the place.

09:17.598 --> 09:20.141
It's okay. You go to bed, okay?

09:34.657 --> 09:35.824
Are you sure you're all right?

09:37.159 --> 09:39.160
I think so.

09:39.328 --> 09:40.829
Okay.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.337
Get some rest.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.006
I love you.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.801
Me too.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.585
Hey, it's me. I can't come to the phone--

10:31.213 --> 10:33.715
Well, I don't think I've seen you
in my class before.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.718
You kidding me?
I love your lectures. You--

10:36.886 --> 10:38.928
You make learning fun. Ha-ha.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.222
So, what can I do for you?

10:41.390 --> 10:43.183
What can you tell me about jinns?

10:43.351 --> 10:46.102
A lot of Muslims believe the jinn
are very real.

10:46.270 --> 10:49.522
- They're mentioned in the Koran.
- Yeah, I know. Get to the wish part.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.609
- What about it?
- Do you think they could really do it?

10:52.860 --> 10:54.444
Um...

10:54.737 --> 10:59.115
Uh, no. No, I don't think
they can really do it.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.576
You understand,
these are mythic creatures.

11:01.744 --> 11:05.455
Yeah. No, I know. I know.
But, uh, I mean, in the stories.

11:05.623 --> 11:08.625
You know, say you had a wish, uh,
but you never even said it out loud.

11:08.793 --> 11:09.918
You know, like, that, uh...

11:10.503 --> 11:15.465
That a loved one never died or that,
uh, something awful never happened.

11:16.050 --> 11:18.093
Supposedly, yes.

11:18.260 --> 11:22.597
I mean, they have godlike power.
They can alter reality however they want.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.724
Past, present, future.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.227
Why would the jinn do it?

11:28.270 --> 11:31.231
What, self defense?
Or maybe it's not really evil.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.275
- Son.
- Hmm.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.236
You been drinking?

11:36.946 --> 11:41.157
Everybody keeps asking me that,
but, uh, no.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.415
Who'd have thought, baby?
We're civilians.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.603
Hey! What's the matter with you?

12:29.123 --> 12:33.042
- Mm. This is the best sandwich ever.
Thank you.

12:33.210 --> 12:36.045
I tried to get ahold of Sam earlier.
Where--? Where is he?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.840
Oh, he'll be here soon.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.092
Good. I'm dying to see him.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.596
Sweetie, uh, don't get me wrong.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.183
I'm thrilled you're hanging out here
all of a sudden.

12:48.350 --> 12:51.144
But, uh, shouldn't you be at work?

12:52.396 --> 12:53.813
Work?

12:54.231 --> 12:56.274
At the garage.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.985
Right. The garage.

12:59.153 --> 13:03.031
That's where I work. Yeah.
No. I've got the day off. Ha.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.657
Good thing.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.368
Mm.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.208
The lawn looks like
it could use some mowing.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.045
- You wanna mow the lawn?
- You kidding me? I'd love to mow the lawn.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.922
Knock yourself out.

13:20.424 --> 13:23.051
Think you'd never mowed a lawn
in your life.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.059
Ah.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.862
I don't believe it.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.038
- Jessica.
Ha.

14:34.206 --> 14:36.583
- Good to see you too, Dean.
Ha-ha-ha.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.585
Can't breathe.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.755
Sammy, look at you.
- Hey.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.592
You're with Jessica. That's--
I don't believe it.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.093
Ha-ha.
- Yeah.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.845
Where'd you guys come from?

14:49.013 --> 14:52.640
- We just flew in from California.
- California.

14:52.808 --> 14:55.143
Stanford, huh? Law school, I bet.

14:57.396 --> 15:01.024
I see you started off Mom's birthday
with a bang, as usual.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.276
Wait, Mom's birthday? That's today?

15:04.612 --> 15:07.697
Yeah. Yeah, Dean, that's today.
That's why we're here.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.490
Don't tell me you forgot.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.999
Wow, that looks awesome.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.877
All right.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.503
To Mom. Happy birthday.

15:22.671 --> 15:23.922
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.506
To Mom.
Cheers.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.014
I was really
worried about you last night.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.182
Oh, I'm-- I'm good.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.392
I'm really good.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.061
Okay.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.022
What do you say later
we get you a cheeseburger?

15:41.190 --> 15:43.149
Oh, God, yes.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.027
How did I end up with such a cool chick?

15:46.445 --> 15:48.696
I just got low standards.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.704
All right, Jess and I actually have
another surprise for Mom's birthday.

15:56.872 --> 15:59.582
- Uh, you wanna tell them?
- They're your family.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.709
All right.
- What? Tell me what?

16:02.503 --> 16:03.878
Oh, my God!

16:05.214 --> 16:08.549
That's wonderful. Congratulations.
Thank you.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.385
Congratulations.
Thank you.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.721
I'm so excited.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.224
I just wish your dad was here.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.309
Yeah, me too.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.187
Jessica, let me see that ring.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.231
Congratulations, Sammy.
- Thanks.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.732
I'm really glad you're happy.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.436
So, Dean, what was, uh...?

17:01.603 --> 17:03.771
What was all that
back at the restaurant?

17:03.939 --> 17:07.483
Oh, I thought I saw someone.
I'm sure it's nothing.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.820
Well, I had a lovely birthday.
Thank you.

17:11.989 --> 17:13.364
Good night.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.532
Night, Mom. Yeah, well, I'm beat.

17:16.076 --> 17:17.868
- Ready to turn in?
Sure.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.494
- Good night, guys.
Good night.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.790
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Come on, it's not even 9:00 yet.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.416
Let's go have a drink or something.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.045
- Maybe another time.
- Come on, man. Look at us.

17:27.212 --> 17:30.089
Huh? We both have beautiful women
on our arms. You're engaged.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.674
Let's go celebrate.

17:34.636 --> 17:37.096
Guys, can you excuse us?
I just wanna talk to my brother.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.723
Sure.
- Thanks.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.600
Come on, Carmen.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.394
So I needed to ask you...

17:43.562 --> 17:45.021
Come here.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.647
What?

17:49.276 --> 17:50.693
Okay.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.946
What's gotten into you?

17:54.114 --> 17:56.157
- What do you mean?
- I mean, this whole...

17:56.325 --> 17:58.618
...warm, fuzzy Ecstasy-trip thing.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.078
I'm just happy for you, Sammy.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.456
Yeah. Right. That's another thing.
Since when do you call me "Sammy"?

18:04.625 --> 18:06.959
Dean. Come on.
We don't talk outside of holidays.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.921
We don't?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.423
Well, we should.
I mean, you're my brother. Ha.

18:12.591 --> 18:16.427
"You're my brother." You know, that's what
you said when you snagged my ATM card.

18:16.595 --> 18:20.473
Or when you bailed on my graduation.
Or when you hooked up with Rachel Nave.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.559
Who?

18:23.727 --> 18:25.478
Uh, my prom date.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.438
On prom night.

18:28.732 --> 18:30.525
Yeah, that does kind of sound like me.

18:30.692 --> 18:34.529
- Well, hey, man, I'm sorry about all that.
- No. Look. It's all right, man. I just--

18:34.696 --> 18:38.116
You know, I'm not asking you
to change. I just, uh...

18:38.867 --> 18:40.535
I don't know.

18:40.702 --> 18:44.122
I guess we just don't really have
anything in common. You know?

18:47.376 --> 18:51.045
- Whoa, whoa. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. Ha.
- What?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.256
- Hunting.
Hunting?

18:54.174 --> 18:56.634
I've never been hunting in my life, Dean.

18:58.720 --> 19:02.140
Yeah, well, we should go sometime.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.724
I think you'd be great at it.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.360
Get some rest.

19:35.048 --> 19:38.217
My favorite.
I guess you know me pretty well.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.261
Afraid so.

19:42.639 --> 19:44.515
You all right?

19:46.602 --> 19:49.854
Sammy and I, we don't get along.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.440
Well, you don't really spend
a lot of time together.

19:52.941 --> 19:56.235
I mean, I just think you don't know
each other all that well.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.531
For the record,
he doesn't know what he's missing.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.285
I could fix things with Sam.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.163
I can make it up to him.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.248
To everyone.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.792
Okay.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.128
What's gotten into you lately?

20:15.172 --> 20:18.007
This isn't gonna make
a lick of sense to you.

20:20.427 --> 20:23.596
But I kind of feel like
I've been given a second chance.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.556
And I don't wanna waste it.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.476
You're right.
That doesn't make any sense.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.650
You know, I get it.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.568
Get what?

20:38.570 --> 20:40.446
Why you're the one.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.531
Well--

20:44.159 --> 20:48.246
Whatever's gotten into you, I like it.

20:58.507 --> 21:03.928
Oh, come on. Don't do this to me now.
I've gotta get ready for work.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.097
You gotta work now?

21:06.431 --> 21:09.809
I told you. I've got
the night shifts on Thursday.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.062
You work nights at the, uh...?

21:16.984 --> 21:18.693
Hospital.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.279
I'm dating a nurse.

21:22.030 --> 21:25.157
That is so respectable.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.537
The olive oil must have a purpose here.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.081
I'll take the olive oil,
and we'll just put a--

21:32.249 --> 21:34.959
Just a touch of olive oil in.
Okay. That's all.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.128
You can't make any mistakes
with this machine.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.714
Now, for liquid, I could use water...

21:39.881 --> 21:41.716
...but I'm gonna use a little spinach--

21:45.220 --> 21:47.513
And today marks
the anniversary of the crash...

21:47.681 --> 21:50.349
...of United Britannia Flight 424.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.060
Indianapolis residents
held a candlelight vigil...

21:53.228 --> 21:54.895
...in memory of the passengers
and crew...

21:55.063 --> 21:57.773
- No. No, I stopped that crash.
- ...who lost their lives--

23:06.635 --> 23:08.344
All of them.

23:09.596 --> 23:13.307
Everyone that you saved.
Everyone Sammy and I saved.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.478
They're all dead.

23:17.979 --> 23:21.524
And there's this woman haunting me.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.109
I don't know why.

23:24.152 --> 23:26.946
I don't know what the connection is.
Not yet anyway.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.324
It's like my old life is coming after me
or something, you know?

23:30.492 --> 23:32.660
Like it doesn't want me to be happy.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.370
Of course, I know what you'd say.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.790
Well, not the you that played softball,
but...

23:38.333 --> 23:42.002
You'd say, "Go hunt the jinn.
Hey, it put you here, it could put you back.

23:42.170 --> 23:46.882
Your happiness for all those people's lives.
No contest, right?"

23:49.302 --> 23:50.469
But why?

23:50.637 --> 23:53.889
Why is it my job to save these people?

23:54.057 --> 23:56.892
Why do I have to be some kind of hero?

23:57.644 --> 23:58.686
What about us, huh?

23:58.854 --> 24:03.357
What, Mom's not supposed to live her life?
Sammy's not supposed to get married?

24:04.151 --> 24:07.153
Why do we have
to sacrifice everything, Dad?

24:09.823 --> 24:11.282
It's--

24:22.794 --> 24:24.462
Yeah.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.569
That was so easy,
I'm embarrassed for you.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.322
Dean? What the hell are you doing here?

25:33.490 --> 25:35.199
I was looking for a beer.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.368
In the china cabinet?

25:43.250 --> 25:45.000
- That's Mom's silver.
- Sam--

25:45.168 --> 25:46.710
What, you broke into the house...

25:46.878 --> 25:49.463
- ...to steal Mom's silver?
- It's not what it looks like.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.507
- I didn't have a choice.
- Oh, really? Why?

25:51.675 --> 25:54.218
What's so damn important
that you gotta steal from your mother?

25:55.053 --> 25:58.806
- You want the truth?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.809
I owe somebody money.

26:03.019 --> 26:05.813
- Who?
- A bookie. I lost big on a game.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.857
- I gotta bring him the cash tonight.
- I can't believe we're even related.

26:09.818 --> 26:12.361
- Sam, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.030
I'm sorry that we don't get along.

26:15.657 --> 26:18.075
And I wish to hell I could stay and fix it.

26:19.619 --> 26:20.995
But I gotta do this.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.497
People's lives depend on it.

26:24.499 --> 26:26.375
What are you talking about, Dean?

26:27.544 --> 26:29.503
Nothing. Forget it. Just, uh...

26:32.048 --> 26:33.424
Hey, tell Mom I love her.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.306
Dean.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.184
I'll see you, Sammy.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.921
- Get out.
- I'm going with you.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.798
- You're gonna slow me down.
- Tough.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.967
- You could get hurt.
- And so could you.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.219
- Sam--
- Whatever stupid thing you're about to do...

27:19.387 --> 27:21.889
...you're not doing it alone.
And that's that.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.892
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

27:26.895 --> 27:29.104
Because you're still my brother.

27:31.775 --> 27:32.775
Bitch.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.903
What are you calling me a bitch for?

27:36.071 --> 27:37.988
- You're supposed to say, "jerk."
- What?

27:38.156 --> 27:39.740
Never mind.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.464
What's in the bag?
- Nothing.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.802
- Nothing?
- Yeah, nothing.

27:59.969 --> 28:01.428
Fine.

28:02.472 --> 28:03.972
- You don't wanna do that.
- Oh, really?

28:08.353 --> 28:10.270
- What the hell is this?
- Blood.

28:10.438 --> 28:13.774
Yeah, I can see that it's blood, Dean.
What the hell is it doing in here?

28:13.942 --> 28:16.944
- You don't really wanna know.
- No, I do really wanna know.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.822
- I really, really do.
- Well, you're gonna find out sooner or later.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.116
I needed a silver knife
dipped in lamb's blood.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.202
You needed a silver knife
dipped in lamb's blood why?

28:25.370 --> 28:28.664
Because there's this creature, a jinn,
and I have to hunt it.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.332
Okay. Um...

28:31.000 --> 28:33.127
- Stop the car.
- I know how it sounds.

28:33.294 --> 28:36.046
- Great. Just stop the car.
- It's the truth, Sam.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.299
There are things out in the dark.
There are bad things.

28:39.467 --> 28:41.468
There are nightmare things.

28:41.636 --> 28:44.638
People have to be saved.
If we don't save them, then nobody will.

28:44.806 --> 28:48.892
I wanna help you, all right? I really do.
You're having some psychotic breakdown.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.854
So I just--
- I wish.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.320
What the hell was that?
That was my phone.

29:00.488 --> 29:03.031
I'm not going to a rubber room.
And we got work to do.

29:03.199 --> 29:04.408
I was just trying to help.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.077
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- What, you protect me?

29:07.245 --> 29:09.037
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's hilarious.

29:09.205 --> 29:12.458
Why don't you just sit tight
and try not to get us both killed?

29:35.690 --> 29:39.568
Where are we?
- Well, we're not in Kansas anymore.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.446
Illinois.

29:43.281 --> 29:44.907
And you think something's in there?

29:45.700 --> 29:47.451
I know it is.

29:58.213 --> 30:01.757
See? There's nothing here, Dean.

30:06.638 --> 30:11.892
Look, Carmen's gotta be worried sick
about you, Dean. Come on, let's just go.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.477
Shh.

30:17.398 --> 30:19.233
What the hell is that?

30:20.235 --> 30:22.653
Stay behind me. Keep your mouth shut.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.305
What the hell?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.573
It's her.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.621
- Dean, what's going on?
- Shh.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.721
Where's my dad?

31:31.139 --> 31:34.224
I don't know. No.

31:35.018 --> 31:38.645
Don't. No. Where's my dad?

31:39.981 --> 31:41.773
Sleep.

31:45.653 --> 31:46.737
Sleep.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.967
Ugh.

32:33.534 --> 32:37.412
- This is real? You're not crazy?
She didn't know where she was.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.831
She thought she was with her father.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.050
What if that's what the jinn does?

32:50.218 --> 32:51.969
It doesn't grant you a wish.

32:52.136 --> 32:55.555
- It just makes you think it has.
- Look, man, that thing could come back...

32:55.723 --> 32:57.224
...all right?

33:18.162 --> 33:19.204
Dean.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.914
Please.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.333
What if I'm like her?

33:23.960 --> 33:26.586
What if I'm tied up in here someplace?

33:27.005 --> 33:28.630
What if all this is in my head?

33:33.928 --> 33:36.680
I mean, it could, you know...

33:36.931 --> 33:39.683
Maybe it gives us
some kind of supernatural acid...

33:39.851 --> 33:43.937
- ...and then just feeds on us slow.
- No. Dean, that doesn't make sense, okay?

33:44.105 --> 33:46.648
What if that's why
she keeps appearing to me?

33:47.775 --> 33:48.817
She's not a spirit.

33:48.985 --> 33:52.654
It's like more and more I'm catching flashes
of reality. I'm in here somewhere.

33:52.822 --> 33:56.533
I'm catatonic. And I'm taking
all this stuff in. But I can't snap out of it.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.578
Yeah. Okay. Look, you're right.
I was wrong. You're not crazy.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.747
But we-- We need to get out of here.
Fast.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.376
I don't think you're real.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.799
Did you feel that? You feel this?
I'm real. This is not an acid trip.

34:12.967 --> 34:16.344
I'm real and that thing's gonna
come down here and kill us for real.

34:16.512 --> 34:18.764
- Now, please.
- There's one way to be sure.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.223
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:21.141 --> 34:22.141
What are you doing?

34:22.310 --> 34:25.603
It's an old-wives' tale. If you're about
to die in a dream, you wake up.

34:25.772 --> 34:28.315
- No. No. No. That's crazy, all right?
- Maybe.

34:28.483 --> 34:31.234
- You're gonna kill yourself-- Okay.
- Or I'm gonna wake up.

34:32.527 --> 34:34.112
- One or the other.
Look.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.658
This isn't a dream, all right?
I'm here, with you, now...

34:38.826 --> 34:41.369
...and you are about
to kill yourself, Dean.

34:41.954 --> 34:43.996
No, I'm pretty sure.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.251
Like 90 percent sure.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.170
But I'm sure enough.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.297
Wait!

35:04.310 --> 35:05.519
Why'd you have to keep digging?

35:07.230 --> 35:10.107
Why couldn't you have left
well enough alone?

35:12.777 --> 35:14.528
You were happy.

35:19.242 --> 35:20.700
Put the knife down, honey.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.996
You're not real.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.456
None of it is.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.211
It doesn't matter.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.630
It's still better than anything you had.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.758
- What?
It's everything you want.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.344
We're a family again.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.264
Let's go home.

35:43.641 --> 35:44.933
I'll die.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.937
The jinn'll drain the life out of me
in a couple of days.

35:49.105 --> 35:53.191
But in here, with us, it'll feel like years...

35:53.526 --> 35:54.568
...like a lifetime.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.156
I promise.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.534
No more pain or fear.

36:02.702 --> 36:06.705
Just love and comfort and safety.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.251
Dean. Stay with us.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.546
Get some rest.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.383
You don't have to worry
about Sam anymore.

36:18.759 --> 36:20.760
You get to watch him live a full life.

36:33.274 --> 36:35.275
We can have a future together.

36:35.443 --> 36:37.485
Have our own family.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.780
I love you, Dean.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.575
Please.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.583
Why is it our job to save everyone?

36:53.377 --> 36:55.086
Haven't we done enough?

36:56.505 --> 36:57.797
I'm begging you.

37:01.969 --> 37:03.094
Give me the knife.

37:23.366 --> 37:24.908
I'm sorry.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.827
Dean!

37:28.329 --> 37:29.829
Dean.

37:30.957 --> 37:31.998
Dean.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.334
Oh, God. Come on.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.670
Hey, wake up.

37:37.296 --> 37:39.005
Wake up, damn it.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.425
Hey. Hey.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.344
Oh, Auntie Em.

37:45.805 --> 37:47.597
There's no place like home.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.057
Thank God.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.018
- I thought I lost you for a second.
- You almost did.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.145
Ugh.

37:55.773 --> 37:56.940
Let's get you down.

38:03.781 --> 38:04.906
Sam!

38:13.874 --> 38:15.500
Come on!

39:01.422 --> 39:03.548
She's still alive. Sam.

39:10.723 --> 39:11.723
I got you.

39:12.266 --> 39:14.601
I got you. We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

39:14.769 --> 39:15.894
I got you.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.272
I got you.

39:37.458 --> 39:41.711
Okay. Uh, thank you so much
for the update. Okay. Bye.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.964
That was the hospital.
The girl's been stabilized.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.717
Good chance she's gonna pull through.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.469
- That's good.
Yeah.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.766
How about you? You all right?

39:55.309 --> 39:57.685
Ahem. Yeah, I'm all right.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.315
You should've seen it, Sam.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.943
Our lives.

40:07.154 --> 40:09.239
You were such a wussy.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.117
So we didn't get along, then, huh?

40:12.284 --> 40:14.536
No.
- Yeah.

40:15.162 --> 40:17.622
I thought it was supposed to be
this perfect fantasy.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.332
It wasn't.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.086
It was just a wish.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.547
Yeah, I wished for Mom to live.

40:25.714 --> 40:29.759
If Mom never died, we never went hunting.
And you and me just never, uh...

40:30.261 --> 40:32.595
- ...you know.
- Yeah.

40:34.181 --> 40:36.099
Well, I'm glad we do.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.063
And I'm glad you dug yourself out, Dean.

40:43.149 --> 40:46.359
Most people wouldn't have had
the strength. They would have stayed.

40:46.902 --> 40:48.778
Yeah. Lucky me.

40:51.532 --> 40:54.826
I gotta tell you, though, man.
You had Jess.

40:55.286 --> 40:57.745
Mom was gonna have grandkids.

40:58.038 --> 41:01.541
Yeah, but, Dean, it wasn't real.

41:01.709 --> 41:02.792
I know.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.672
But I wanted to stay.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.845
I wanted to stay so bad.

41:17.516 --> 41:19.559
I mean, ever since Dad...

41:21.770 --> 41:25.607
...all I can think about
is how much this job's cost us.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.490
We've lost so much.

41:35.743 --> 41:37.285
We've...

41:37.578 --> 41:39.037
...sacrificed so much--

41:39.205 --> 41:42.415
But people are alive because of you.
It's worth it, Dean.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.542
It is. It's not fair.

41:46.003 --> 41:49.339
And, you know, it hurts like hell,
but it's worth it.
