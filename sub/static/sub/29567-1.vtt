WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:04.961
(eerie music)

00:18.241 --> 00:20.908
(ominous music)

00:34.530 --> 00:35.350
-  Let's talk about black

00:35.400 --> 00:37.170
unemployment rate okay.

00:37.220 --> 00:40.810
It is the lowest it's ever been.

00:40.860 --> 00:42.260
Obama couldn't even do that.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.015
Nobody could come close.

00:44.065 --> 00:46.732
(ominous music)

00:52.501 --> 00:53.990
You know what I think we should do?

00:54.040 --> 00:57.950
We should have a new show
called Mexican Ninja.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.510
I mean 'cause they're strong.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.800
That's why I'm gonna make the wall

01:01.850 --> 01:04.123
very very tall, okay?

01:04.173 --> 01:05.953
Because it could climb that easily.

01:17.026 --> 01:18.270
-  When the
crowd heard that Reagan

01:18.320 --> 01:21.442
was the projected winner,
here's what happened.

01:21.492 --> 01:22.406
-  Ronald Reagan is the winner

01:22.456 --> 01:24.994
for the 1980 election
and our next president!

01:25.044 --> 01:29.794
(cheering)
(owl hooting)

01:30.735 --> 01:31.518
-  Well the night is young

01:31.568 --> 01:33.347
as far as the celebration is going here.

01:33.397 --> 01:36.270
In an hour or so they're planning
a fireworks demonstration.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.413
- Paging Scorchy McDaniels!

01:40.170 --> 01:40.953
He gone?

01:41.003 --> 01:43.996
- Yes my husband is gone, Jermajesty.

01:44.046 --> 01:45.190
Now get that big 10-inch over here.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.140
- 10?

01:46.190 --> 01:47.790
Girl you must need glasses.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.147
You seein' double.

01:49.197 --> 01:49.980
(screaming)

01:50.030 --> 01:51.060
-  He won't be back for hours.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.240
We have all night.

01:52.290 --> 01:54.190
- Music to my ears!

01:56.810 --> 01:57.910
I love these girls.

01:57.960 --> 01:58.743
- Wait.

01:58.793 --> 02:00.430
Have you seen little David?

02:00.480 --> 02:02.223
I wouldn't want to traumatize him.

02:03.295 --> 02:04.921
- He's right there.

02:04.971 --> 02:06.526
(screaming)

02:06.576 --> 02:09.600
He's been watching us through
the window this whole time.

02:09.650 --> 02:11.320
Look at this little shit head.

02:11.370 --> 02:13.490
Trying to hide like we can't see his

02:13.540 --> 02:15.570
pig-face motherfucking ass.

02:15.620 --> 02:18.300
- He gets that from his father's side.

02:18.350 --> 02:20.280
- Why'd you have him anyway?

02:20.330 --> 02:22.300
- Having that little turd was my one way

02:22.350 --> 02:24.143
ticket to the Barron Empire.

02:25.940 --> 02:27.923
Look what Freddy got me today.

02:29.618 --> 02:31.035
It cost $130,000!

02:35.510 --> 02:38.770
- Scorchy, I stand
corrected, nicely played.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.003
- Now, I want to feel
a supernova in my womb.

02:43.150 --> 02:46.260
- We are gonna go intergalactic
black hole type of shit!

02:46.310 --> 02:47.110
- Yes!

02:47.160 --> 02:49.030
- They are gonna have to peel your ass off

02:49.080 --> 02:50.380
the ceiling in the morning!

02:50.430 --> 02:52.863
Big bang times 10 type of shit!

02:56.581 --> 02:58.803
-  The way it is going tonight.

02:58.853 --> 03:01.314
In all my years I think it's not too early

03:01.364 --> 03:06.181
to talk about one of Reagan's
presidencies might be like.

03:06.231 --> 03:08.110
-  Well Will,
I was reared to beware

03:08.160 --> 03:10.110
of the man who caused (speaks too low).

03:13.150 --> 03:15.040
-  What can you expect from

03:15.090 --> 03:18.671
a Reagan administration other
than Jimmy Carter's scalp?

03:18.721 --> 03:20.190
-  Well I think we'll see a lot

03:20.240 --> 03:22.682
of businesses coming to Washington--

03:22.732 --> 03:25.399
(ominous music)

03:27.145 --> 03:27.928
- Woo hoo!

03:27.978 --> 03:29.720
I will see you in the morning!

03:29.770 --> 03:31.500
-  I'll be waiting.

03:31.550 --> 03:32.937
You were amazing!

03:34.350 --> 03:35.663
- God damn right I was.

03:36.769 --> 03:39.186
Jermasty you are a devil dog.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.497
I can see you.

03:45.203 --> 03:46.960
You are one dumb kid.

03:47.010 --> 03:49.740
And take that Ronald Reagan mask off.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.790
Everybody knows this country ain't stupid

03:51.840 --> 03:53.920
enough to elect another Republican.

03:54.963 --> 03:59.706
After that Gerald Ford bullshit.

03:59.756 --> 04:02.423
(ominous music)

04:04.271 --> 04:07.104
(heavy breathing)

04:23.869 --> 04:26.137
♪ You got no more money honey ♪

04:26.187 --> 04:28.730
♪ Then I got no more time ♪

04:28.780 --> 04:30.824
- You shouldn't be here
my little orangutan.

04:30.874 --> 04:31.657
People might say you're too old

04:31.707 --> 04:33.651
to see your mommy like this.

04:33.701 --> 04:35.034
Well, maybe not.

04:35.897 --> 04:37.147
Are you hungry?

04:38.707 --> 04:40.503
What are you doing?

04:40.553 --> 04:44.230
(screaming)
(suspenseful music)

04:44.280 --> 04:46.863
(loud popping)

04:52.047 --> 04:54.964
(melancholy music)

05:19.126 --> 05:22.793
(speaking foreign language)

05:34.272 --> 05:36.939
(ominous music)

05:56.641 --> 05:59.224
(loud buzzing)

06:02.416 --> 06:06.658
- Christ, why does it have
to happen on my watch?

06:06.708 --> 06:07.580
- You got to save us.

06:07.630 --> 06:08.540
- On my salary?

06:08.590 --> 06:09.817
You on your own man!

06:11.576 --> 06:13.720
- Why would God let him escape?

06:16.433 --> 06:17.266
Why!

06:18.593 --> 06:23.593
Why God, why!
(suspenseful music)

06:28.110 --> 06:29.063
- Dr. Clinton.

06:36.264 --> 06:38.931
(loud growling)

06:40.200 --> 06:42.620
Gosh that's a really bad cough.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.680
This is Yen, I'm at
the southeast stairwell

06:45.730 --> 06:47.512
and Dr. Clinton was stabbed in the back

06:47.562 --> 06:49.692
and she fell down the stairs.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.231
-  Fell down the stairs?

06:51.281 --> 06:52.064
What, again?

06:52.114 --> 06:54.600
- Just get a medic here asap!

06:54.650 --> 06:58.030
- David has escaped and
you have to stop him.

06:58.080 --> 07:02.360
The world is not ready for
this creature's hatred,

07:02.410 --> 07:06.090
hypocrisy, insolence, lies,

07:06.140 --> 07:07.653
prejudice, and vanity.

07:08.655 --> 07:11.404
Not to mention that hair.

07:11.454 --> 07:13.908
You have to stop him.

07:13.958 --> 07:15.375
- Clinton let go.

07:20.291 --> 07:22.958
(loud growling)

07:24.410 --> 07:25.243
- Oh shit!

07:26.124 --> 07:30.475
Dr. Combes!

07:30.525 --> 07:31.820
And Dr. McCabe!

07:36.980 --> 07:37.763
All units.

07:37.813 --> 07:39.650
I think I spotted him.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.580
He's heading over to the west gate.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.783
Someone, anyone, stop him.

07:44.700 --> 07:45.593
Just not me.

07:46.970 --> 07:47.803
Don't let him

07:48.670 --> 07:49.503
get out.

07:52.792 --> 07:55.709
(melancholy music)

08:02.990 --> 08:06.090
(ominous music)

08:06.140 --> 08:07.790
- Four of our best
doctors murdered by that

08:07.840 --> 08:10.040
deranged lunatic, Dr. Lutin, four.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.320
And you know where David is
going but won't disclose it?

08:11.370 --> 08:12.630
- Where he might be going.

08:12.680 --> 08:14.140
- You have no right to
withhold that information.

08:14.190 --> 08:16.210
- As a medic I have every
right to withhold information.

08:16.260 --> 08:17.220
And you have allowed your personal

08:17.270 --> 08:18.660
feelings to skew your judgment Dr. Schiff.

08:18.710 --> 08:21.740
- What exactly is it
between you and David huh?

08:21.790 --> 08:24.260
He hated everyone on the staff except you.

08:24.310 --> 08:25.520
What kind of hold do you have over him?

08:25.570 --> 08:27.970
- You're insinuating that
there was some form of

08:29.320 --> 08:32.429
collusion between David and me?

08:32.480 --> 08:34.559
Then produce the evidence.

08:34.610 --> 08:35.820
- Oh we are.

08:35.870 --> 08:38.030
An internal investigation
has already begun.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.210
- Based on hysteria.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.440
You all need to take your pills.

08:40.490 --> 08:41.559
- We're also looking into your sudden

08:41.610 --> 08:42.770
rise of power here at the hospital.

08:42.820 --> 08:43.970
- I don't know what you mean.

08:44.020 --> 08:46.040
- Meaning that there's
something very sinister

08:46.090 --> 08:48.250
in the nature of your stranglehold here.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.850
- Like envy, or resentment, or both?

08:50.900 --> 08:52.720
- We have a witness Dr. Lutin.

08:52.770 --> 08:54.640
- Would that be Dr. Sergei?

08:54.690 --> 08:56.230
- Why yes it would.

08:56.280 --> 09:00.760
- Sergei met with an unfortunate
accident late last night.

09:00.810 --> 09:02.770
He will not be your witness.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.510
- What are you saying?

09:04.560 --> 09:06.160
- He expired.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.740
- You had something to do
with his death didn't you?

09:07.790 --> 09:11.360
- Another accusation based
on no tangible evidence.

09:11.410 --> 09:12.493
I'll be in touch.

09:40.539 --> 09:43.456
(slow paced music)

09:45.675 --> 09:48.998
(speaking foreign language)

09:49.048 --> 09:52.715
(speaking foreign language)

09:56.360 --> 09:57.673
- What a beautiful day.

09:59.125 --> 10:01.458
(whistling)

10:17.397 --> 10:18.867
-  Lana!

10:18.917 --> 10:20.415
- Good morning Pepe.

10:20.465 --> 10:22.290
- Good morning.

10:22.340 --> 10:24.710
- I'm so sorry to hear about your parents.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.920
Any word yet?

10:25.970 --> 10:28.730
- Not since the ICE agents took them away.

10:28.780 --> 10:31.710
Blanca has been calling
every day to find them.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.350
- I hope they're okay.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.890
- Me too.

10:34.940 --> 10:35.723
Lana.

10:35.773 --> 10:36.650
- Yes.

10:36.700 --> 10:38.463
- Why is this happening?

10:41.350 --> 10:43.200
- The people who run our country

10:43.250 --> 10:46.230
are filled with hatred,
prejudice, and fear.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.270
They think we're different
so they persecute us.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.570
- Even if we haven't done anything wrong?

10:50.620 --> 10:52.650
Like mi mama and papa?

10:52.700 --> 10:53.550
- That's right.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.650
We live in a dangerous world Pepe.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.430
We have to learn how to cope.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.830
The Republican party...

10:59.890 --> 11:02.420
- Don't say that word.

11:02.470 --> 11:03.950
It scares me.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.783
- Republican?

11:04.833 --> 11:05.616
- Yes.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.020
They're the ones who took my parents away.

11:08.070 --> 11:10.030
And now Blanca said they
could take her away too

11:10.080 --> 11:12.090
because she's a DACA recipient.

11:12.140 --> 11:13.533
I'll be all alone.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.250
- Your sister won't leave you.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.780
We're gonna fight this all the way.

11:17.830 --> 11:19.190
I promise you.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.023
- Okay.

11:20.073 --> 11:21.590
- You know, a great American president

11:21.640 --> 11:24.137
once said, "With malice toward none and

11:24.187 --> 11:25.300
"with charity for all."

11:25.350 --> 11:26.330
- Abraham Lincoln.

11:26.380 --> 11:27.750
- Yes, that's right.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.280
But in today's world, those amazing words

11:30.330 --> 11:32.680
only apply to the wealthy, the privileged,

11:32.730 --> 11:34.523
the intolerant, and the ignorant.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.260
Muslim, Mexican, Haitian,

11:38.310 --> 11:40.763
gay, black, transgender,

11:41.890 --> 11:44.630
they don't want us to be a
part of their elitist society.

11:44.680 --> 11:45.840
If it was up to them,

11:45.890 --> 11:47.840
they would throw us all away.

11:47.890 --> 11:49.422
You know what that makes them?

11:49.472 --> 11:50.255
- What?

11:50.305 --> 11:51.720
- Fucking assholes.

11:51.770 --> 11:53.560
- You said a bad word!

11:53.610 --> 11:55.310
- Do you know what's even scarier?

11:56.170 --> 11:58.170
The people in this country who believe

11:58.220 --> 11:59.820
the same things.

11:59.870 --> 12:03.220
Who follow and support
the hatred and bigotry.

12:03.270 --> 12:04.630
They're even worse.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.680
- Like those mean men I see on TV?

12:06.730 --> 12:07.513
- Yes.

12:07.563 --> 12:09.583
Like Sean Carlson and Tucker Hannity.

12:10.420 --> 12:12.790
All these horrible people
I would categorize as--

12:12.840 --> 12:14.930
- Stupid fucking assholes?

12:14.980 --> 12:16.180
- Now you're getting it.

12:18.820 --> 12:22.520
Also, just remember this when
you're feeling very scared.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.860
You have a powerful shield against them.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.480
It protects you.

12:26.530 --> 12:27.720
Do you know what it is?

12:27.770 --> 12:28.967
- What?

12:29.017 --> 12:30.897
- You're an American citizen.

12:30.947 --> 12:32.150
- I am?

12:32.200 --> 12:33.623
- You were born here weren't you?

12:33.673 --> 12:34.980
- Yeah.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.410
- That gives you a whole lot of ammunition

12:36.460 --> 12:38.050
to fight against them.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.940
Don't ever let anybody tell you you can't

12:39.990 --> 12:41.590
change the world Pepe.

12:41.640 --> 12:42.860
Heck, one day you might even be the

12:42.910 --> 12:45.090
President of the United States.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.590
I'll vote for you.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.163
Now, let's go before you're
late for school, okay?

12:51.550 --> 12:52.990
Oh, I have to drop off the keys

12:53.040 --> 12:54.920
at the McDaniels first real quick.

12:54.970 --> 12:56.150
- The McDaniels house.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.610
You can't go there, it's possessed!

12:58.660 --> 13:00.530
They say it's the gateway to hell.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.380
The son of the devil was born there.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.030
- Just an urban legend.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.689
Stay right here, I'll be back.

13:06.739 --> 13:07.906
-  Okay.

13:22.703 --> 13:25.370
(ominous music)

13:26.480 --> 13:27.313
- Hello?

13:36.125 --> 13:39.792
(speaking foreign language)

14:01.344 --> 14:03.761
(ominous music)

14:03.811 --> 14:05.150
(clanking)

14:05.200 --> 14:06.370
Who's there?

14:06.420 --> 14:07.333
Hello?

14:08.230 --> 14:09.173
Hello?

14:12.999 --> 14:16.030
(upbeat ringtone)

14:16.080 --> 14:17.680
Blanca, don't do that.

14:17.730 --> 14:18.513
-  Do what?

14:18.563 --> 14:19.705
It's a phone, you get calls.

14:19.755 --> 14:21.170
Where are you?

14:21.220 --> 14:22.524
- At the McDaniels house.

14:22.574 --> 14:23.690
-  Aye, get out of there girl,

14:23.740 --> 14:24.523
that place is possessed.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.290
- Soy here, the padlock
on the door was broken

14:27.340 --> 14:28.770
and the door was open.

14:28.820 --> 14:31.170
My dad's seen homeless
people sleeping in here.

14:32.150 --> 14:33.224
I hear a noise.

14:33.274 --> 14:34.597
-  (speaking foreign
language) you're still there.

14:34.647 --> 14:36.750
Jesus, you're like one of those
(speaking foreign language)

14:36.800 --> 14:37.720
in the movies who don't run away

14:37.770 --> 14:38.890
when they see the killer coming.

14:38.940 --> 14:40.714
- I gotta go, see you in a few.

14:40.764 --> 14:43.431
(ominous music)

14:59.482 --> 15:02.482
(suspenseful music)

15:18.542 --> 15:19.325
(clanking)

15:19.375 --> 15:20.208
Shit.

15:25.747 --> 15:28.747
(suspenseful music)

15:45.070 --> 15:47.480
See, nothing to be scared of.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.690
Hey, why don't you come
tonight with your sister?

15:49.740 --> 15:51.380
We're making the banners and watching

15:51.430 --> 15:52.769
the State of the Union Address.

15:52.819 --> 15:53.602
We could use your help.

15:53.652 --> 15:54.435
- Really?

15:54.485 --> 15:55.268
- Sure, come with your sister.

15:55.318 --> 15:57.610
- Isn't the State of the
Union speech in January?

15:57.660 --> 15:59.750
-  Not anymore, the
mob boss of the United States

15:59.800 --> 16:02.140
moved it up so he can vacation in Crimea.

16:02.190 --> 16:03.130
-  Well, I'll see you tonight.

16:03.180 --> 16:04.013
-  Bye.

16:05.431 --> 16:09.098
(sings in foreign language)

16:14.536 --> 16:15.319
(ominous music)

16:15.369 --> 16:16.400
- There was a big Republican rally today

16:16.450 --> 16:17.837
in the town of (speaks
in foreign language).

16:19.510 --> 16:22.960
A man matching the description
knocked out a driver,

16:23.010 --> 16:25.870
took his clothes, and stole his vehicle.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.180
So it's only a matter of time now.

16:27.230 --> 16:28.650
- Time for what Dr. Schiff?

16:28.700 --> 16:29.740
- Murder Dr. Lutin.

16:29.790 --> 16:31.040
The man is evil.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.330
- Alright.

16:32.380 --> 16:33.570
David's heading for Sinclair.

16:33.620 --> 16:36.040
He spent some times there
at Big Brothers Summer Camp.

16:36.090 --> 16:38.190
Often spoke of returning there one day.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.720
They have a hilarious puppet show.

16:39.770 --> 16:40.840
- You're not bullshitting me?

16:40.890 --> 16:42.830
-  I've always been
a man of my word Dr. Schiff.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.110
- Yeah okay sure.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.453
The only one stupid enough
to believe that is David.

16:45.503 --> 16:47.200
-  Think what you may,

16:47.250 --> 16:49.713
but David is not my bride
and I'm not his groom.

16:50.990 --> 16:53.150
- Alright, I'll let the authorities know

16:53.200 --> 16:54.650
to meet David in Sinclair.

16:54.700 --> 16:55.800
You stay by the phone.

17:07.537 --> 17:10.287
(birds chirping)

17:30.600 --> 17:33.873
- Hello, is there anyone here?

17:35.150 --> 17:38.250
I am locking the door from the outside

17:38.300 --> 17:41.373
so you will not be able to get out!

17:42.558 --> 17:44.210
(clanking)

17:44.260 --> 17:47.830
Whoever you are, come on out.

17:47.880 --> 17:51.403
You do not need to be afraid my friend.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.390
If you are in trouble,

17:55.440 --> 17:57.920
I will help you.

17:57.970 --> 18:00.460
If you are hungry,

18:00.510 --> 18:02.930
I will feed you.

18:02.980 --> 18:07.190
This is the credo of my people

18:07.240 --> 18:10.010
and well-being of our fellow--

18:10.060 --> 18:11.783
(dramatic music)

18:11.833 --> 18:14.000
(moaning)

18:28.810 --> 18:31.610
- Hitler used the idea of the Big Lie

18:31.660 --> 18:33.950
to mind control the people.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.040
Just tell them and they'll believe it.

18:37.090 --> 18:38.090
That's it.

18:38.140 --> 18:39.973
They just do.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.440
He used the use of trigger words

18:42.490 --> 18:43.940
to manipulate the people.

18:43.990 --> 18:47.170
Such as loser, winning,

18:47.220 --> 18:51.063
believe me, low-life, and covfefe.

18:51.900 --> 18:55.090
Hitler was just one man,
yet he rose to power.

18:55.140 --> 18:56.720
How Ms. Shaheed?

18:56.770 --> 18:58.920
- It was made possible by
his millions of supporters

18:58.970 --> 19:00.250
who wanted to believe his lies

19:00.300 --> 19:02.390
and did his dirty work for him.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.360
-  Yes!

19:03.410 --> 19:04.680
- Mr. Doocy.

19:04.730 --> 19:07.240
(loud screeching)

19:07.290 --> 19:08.553
- It's Doocy!

19:09.780 --> 19:11.240
- Doocy.

19:11.290 --> 19:14.680
Isn't it true that your great grandfather,

19:14.730 --> 19:17.860
Victor Von Doocy, hosted a radio show

19:17.910 --> 19:19.860
called the Fuhrer and Friends

19:19.910 --> 19:23.620
that subversively turned over
half of American Citizens

19:23.670 --> 19:26.000
into Nazi sympathizers?

19:26.050 --> 19:28.420
- Yes that is an unfortunate

19:28.470 --> 19:30.500
part of my scandalous heritage

19:30.550 --> 19:33.910
which I do not wish to discuss!

19:33.960 --> 19:37.750
Is that clear Mr. Scarborough?

19:37.800 --> 19:38.780
- Well isn't it true--

19:38.830 --> 19:39.900
- Remember boys and girls,

19:39.950 --> 19:41.960
after class we are
meeting in the courtyard

19:42.010 --> 19:44.180
to witness today's solar eclipse.

19:44.230 --> 19:47.263
Each of you will receive
a pair of these glasses.

19:48.250 --> 19:52.370
But do not stare directly
into the eclipse!

19:52.420 --> 19:55.130
As it will cause irreparable
harm to your retinas.

19:55.180 --> 19:57.240
But you all know this because you're not

19:57.290 --> 19:59.161
brainless idiots!

19:59.211 --> 20:01.461
(laughing)

20:06.410 --> 20:08.890
Our esteemed math teacher and rugby coach,

20:08.940 --> 20:11.900
Mrs. L. Ying Conway will escort you

20:11.950 --> 20:13.123
after we are adjourned.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.370
Now back to Hitler.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.360
Hitler's lies and rhetoric destroyed and

20:17.410 --> 20:19.620
deceived millions of lives.
(engine revving)

20:19.670 --> 20:22.130
And any radio programs, or newspapers

20:22.180 --> 20:23.970
who called out his lies

20:24.020 --> 20:26.270
were deemed fake news.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.200
And any officials who opposed him

20:28.250 --> 20:30.653
were arrested and taken
before a firing squad.

20:32.276 --> 20:34.443

20:40.410 --> 20:41.500

20:41.550 --> 20:43.990
- Look, your DACA sister, she's next.

20:52.743 --> 20:54.740

family should go back

20:54.790 --> 20:55.850
to your shit hole country.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.400
- Shut up Sessions, we won't!

20:57.450 --> 20:59.330
- We don't want you here anyway.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.860
You're gonna grow up to be
a rapist or a drug dealer.

21:01.910 --> 21:02.693
- Shut up, Arpaio.

21:02.743 --> 21:03.526
I am not.

of the United States.

22:08.270 --> 22:10.450
- Scorchy McDaniels.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.418
A voluptuous porn star with
giant triple D titties.

22:14.468 --> 22:16.900
And might I say an underrated actress.

22:16.950 --> 22:19.550
I owned all of her VHS tapes.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.640
I did not have sex
relations with that woman.

22:22.690 --> 22:23.523
I wanted to.

22:24.450 --> 22:25.840
She helped get me through the Bush years.

22:25.890 --> 22:28.010
- It pains me to hear you speak.

22:28.060 --> 22:31.253
- I have great fondness for
three of her cinematic opuses.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.823
Howard the Fuck, Anal Just-Ass League,

22:36.950 --> 22:39.100

22:40.870 --> 22:41.828
You Stupid Motherfu--

22:41.878 --> 22:43.543
- Just find the grave.

22:43.593 --> 22:44.426
- Okay.

22:46.485 --> 22:50.090

23:35.957 --> 23:37.167
"Hashtag sad."

23:38.390 --> 23:39.273

23:40.110 --> 23:42.440
- You know the man who did this?

23:42.490 --> 23:44.090
- I do.

23:44.140 --> 23:45.193
He's my patient.

23:46.870 --> 23:48.453
- He spelled digging wrong.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.027
He opened money digging
whore with quotation marks

23:53.077 --> 23:55.283
and then finished it with an apostrophe.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.353
- Yes.

23:58.530 --> 23:59.983
- Whore is misspelled.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.400
It should be, she lies here not she lays.

24:05.450 --> 24:06.780
- Yes.

24:06.830 --> 24:10.163
- This is grammatical and
syntactic cluster fuck.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.010
What is he, some kind of retard?

24:17.010 --> 24:18.880
- I think we're done here.

24:18.930 --> 24:19.713
- Can you believe it?

24:19.763 --> 24:21.760
He commits a felony and is still

24:21.810 --> 24:23.570
elected teacher of the year.

24:23.620 --> 24:24.870
- Incredible.

24:24.920 --> 24:25.703
What do you think is worse?

24:25.753 --> 24:26.536
School or hell?

24:26.586 --> 24:27.510
- School in hell.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.917
- Boo.
(screaming)

24:29.967 --> 24:31.380
(gasping)

24:31.430 --> 24:33.000
- You girls think this is hell?

24:33.050 --> 24:36.550
You have no idea what hell is like.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.500
- I bet you do Father Guiliani.

24:38.550 --> 24:40.653
- Indeed I do, indeed I do.

24:41.510 --> 24:43.360
Have you girls found Jesus?

24:43.410 --> 24:45.220
- I wasn't really looking.
(angelic singing)

24:45.270 --> 24:46.620
- Maybe he's down my shirt.

24:47.950 --> 24:50.423
- He is right here girls.

24:52.220 --> 24:55.793
But, you have to want his love.

24:57.334 --> 24:58.384
You have to reach out

24:59.559 --> 25:01.803
and grab his love.

25:05.017 --> 25:07.303
Are you feeling his
love grow in your hands?

25:08.400 --> 25:09.630
You wanna get down on your knees

25:09.680 --> 25:11.530
and feel his love all over your face?

25:12.790 --> 25:14.880
- I don't think Jesus would be into me.

25:14.930 --> 25:15.763
I'm Muslim.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.877
- Move along girls, baby
Jesus hates dwellers.

25:19.927 --> 25:21.400
- Fucking freak.

25:21.450 --> 25:22.720
-  He's such a perv.

25:22.770 --> 25:23.580
Can you believe he got away with molesting

25:23.630 --> 25:24.560
those underage boys?

25:24.610 --> 25:25.393
-  Yeah, all underage.

25:25.443 --> 25:26.486
- All of them.

25:26.536 --> 25:27.319
- They were of age.

25:27.369 --> 25:28.152
- Who?

25:28.202 --> 25:29.560
- No one.

25:29.610 --> 25:31.820
Girls, life begins--

25:31.870 --> 25:33.490
- I know, I know, conception.

25:33.540 --> 25:34.373
- No.

25:35.550 --> 25:36.383
Erection.

25:37.270 --> 25:38.823
Girls, I'm a man of the cloth.

25:40.220 --> 25:41.710
I can get away with rape, murder,

25:41.760 --> 25:45.320
incest, pedophilia, and even
bestiality if I felt like it.

25:45.370 --> 25:47.120
Without any consequences.

25:47.170 --> 25:47.953
I answer to God.

25:48.003 --> 25:53.003
He is my judge, jury, and
executioner in the end.

25:53.150 --> 25:54.626
- Let's go.

25:54.676 --> 25:56.480
- Why not have a little
fun in the meantime?

25:56.530 --> 25:58.230
- Shall we schedule your meeting with God

25:58.280 --> 25:59.850
say, right now!

25:59.900 --> 26:00.700
- You think you're gonna get away

26:00.750 --> 26:02.170
with all this shit you piece of fuck!

26:02.220 --> 26:04.253
We're here to make sure you don't!

26:05.180 --> 26:07.632
(loud thud)
(screaming)

26:07.682 --> 26:12.682
Fucking asshole.
(angelic singing)

26:20.251 --> 26:22.647
(ominous music)

26:22.697 --> 26:24.511
I have 42 people confirmed.

26:24.561 --> 26:25.356
You?

26:25.406 --> 26:27.433
82 so far.

26:28.380 --> 26:29.280
- Great!

26:29.330 --> 26:30.780
Glad you're getting so
many families involved.

26:30.830 --> 26:34.022
- That's just the Rodriguez
and Martinez families.

26:34.072 --> 26:35.940
- What, 82 people?

26:35.990 --> 26:38.930
- What, I can't help it
if passions in our blood.

26:38.980 --> 26:40.863
Oh and the daily tequila shots.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.532
- Anyway, strength in numbers right?

26:43.582 --> 26:44.820
- Hey.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.970
I heard the news coverage is
gonna be through the roof.

26:48.020 --> 26:50.310
I want the whole country,
the world to know

26:50.360 --> 26:52.490
that my parents were taken away.

26:52.540 --> 26:53.980
- Oh by the way Medjine, we're coming over

26:54.030 --> 26:55.080
to your place tonight to watch

26:55.130 --> 26:56.855
the State of the Union Address.

26:56.905 --> 26:59.020
- Oh great, my nights to be ruined.

26:59.070 --> 27:00.220
Why my place?

27:00.270 --> 27:01.630
- Because your parents are out of town

27:01.680 --> 27:03.435
and your place is stuffed with booze.

27:03.485 --> 27:05.726
(laughing)

27:05.776 --> 27:07.051
-  And Gabriel is gonna be there.

27:07.101 --> 27:07.884
(eerie music)

27:07.934 --> 27:09.248
- I feel so bad for him.

27:09.298 --> 27:13.560
First purple heart, bronze
star, silver star, and now this.

27:20.550 --> 27:22.740
Is that one of those ISIS agents?

27:22.790 --> 27:23.670
-  ICE agents.

27:23.720 --> 27:25.030
-  Same difference.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.510
- I don't think so.

27:26.560 --> 27:27.710
That weirdo was looking at me through

27:27.760 --> 27:28.813
the window at school.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.360
- Republican creep, why don't you take

27:31.410 --> 27:32.386
that stick shift out your--

27:32.436 --> 27:33.219
- Hey, cut it out Blanca,

27:33.269 --> 27:34.883
you're gonna get us all deported!

27:37.110 --> 27:39.420
-  I hate a Republican
without a sense of humor.

27:39.470 --> 27:41.043
-  Is there any other kind?

27:44.950 --> 27:47.020
- Okay, so I'm gonna
make Pepe some dinner,

27:47.070 --> 27:48.020
then I'm gonna get my stuff together

27:48.070 --> 27:49.390
and I'll pick you up in 45?

27:49.440 --> 27:50.672
- Yeah, sounds good.

27:50.722 --> 27:54.222
(speaks foreign language)

27:55.928 --> 27:58.928
(suspenseful music)

28:00.781 --> 28:01.614
- Hey you!

28:29.092 --> 28:30.430
(dramatic music)

28:30.480 --> 28:31.960
- I didn't mean to scare you Lana.

28:32.010 --> 28:32.800
- It's okay.

28:32.850 --> 28:34.580
This scary guy's been following me.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.350
He's wearing a suit and
creepy presidents mask.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.533
He was right there.

28:42.253 --> 28:43.763
- I don't see anybody.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.280
It's just your mind playing tricks on you.

28:47.330 --> 28:48.410
Hey, we've all got the jitters

28:48.460 --> 28:50.530
with those mid-terms
right around the corner.

28:50.580 --> 28:52.170
- Yeah, that must be it.

28:52.220 --> 28:54.000
- You still participating
in that rally tomorrow?

28:54.050 --> 28:55.720
- Yes of course, yeah.

28:55.770 --> 28:58.000
- I believe in your cause Lana.

28:58.050 --> 28:59.700
- I appreciate that Sheriff Mueller.

28:59.750 --> 29:00.533
Thank you.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.236
- You enjoy the rest of your day okay?

29:02.286 --> 29:03.119
- You too.

29:10.872 --> 29:13.539
(ominous music)

29:19.583 --> 29:23.416
(singing in foreign language)

29:27.343 --> 29:30.010
(door creaking)

29:39.894 --> 29:41.350
- David.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.143
David it's Dr. Lutin.

29:44.810 --> 29:45.803
You can come out.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.670
Have no fear little one.

29:58.720 --> 30:01.536
I am here to protect thee.

30:01.586 --> 30:04.253
(ominous music)

30:14.258 --> 30:17.591
(slow triumphant music)

30:50.327 --> 30:53.994
(music in foreign language)

30:58.290 --> 31:00.550
- So, I have to make
one stop along the way.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.170
- Oh, where?

31:02.220 --> 31:03.420
- My church.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.150
I have to get my fiesta box.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.220
- What's that?

31:06.270 --> 31:08.230
- Oh, you didn't hear?

31:08.280 --> 31:09.560
Food stamps have been discontinued

31:09.610 --> 31:12.780
so now the impoverished get
a fiesta box once a week.

31:12.830 --> 31:13.890
- You're kidding me.

31:13.940 --> 31:14.760
- Nope.

31:14.810 --> 31:16.820
You can thank the Christian Conservatives

31:16.870 --> 31:18.620
for that brilliant idea.

31:18.670 --> 31:19.633
- That's crazy.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.110
Can we change the station?

31:22.160 --> 31:24.570
- Yeah, go ahead if you want to.

31:24.620 --> 31:26.959
I like that song, but whatever.

31:27.009 --> 31:28.046
- Thank you.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.580
-  Native American, young, old,

31:30.630 --> 31:33.970
gay, straight, men, women,

31:34.020 --> 31:37.140
folks with disabilities,
all pledging allegiance

31:37.190 --> 31:39.200
under the same proud flag to this

31:39.250 --> 31:41.980
big bold country that we love.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.100
That's what I see.

31:43.150 --> 31:45.620
- (speaks foreign language)
I miss you so much.

31:45.670 --> 31:46.453
Come back.

31:46.503 --> 31:49.160
-  Kids who have a
different sexual orientation

31:49.210 --> 31:52.970
or are transgender are
subject to a lot of bullying.

31:53.020 --> 31:54.360
Children should be allowed to use

31:54.410 --> 31:55.943
the bathroom of their choice.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.890
- We miss you Obama.

31:58.940 --> 32:02.030
-  In response, the
president had this to say.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.420
-  You know what
happened to the Greeks?

32:04.470 --> 32:06.880
Homosexuality destroyed them.

32:06.930 --> 32:08.590
Aristotle was a fag.

32:08.640 --> 32:09.473
So was Socrates.

32:10.382 --> 32:11.335
(Blanca growling)

32:11.385 --> 32:12.490
(speaking in foreign language)

32:12.540 --> 32:14.232
- I can't stand the sound of
(speaks in foreign language)

32:14.282 --> 32:15.466
voice, he's such a pig fucker!

32:15.516 --> 32:16.299
He's not even a man!

32:16.349 --> 32:18.350
He should just crawl
up his own ass and die!

32:18.400 --> 32:19.183
Jesus!

32:19.233 --> 32:22.210
-  But once priests
started stuffing each others'

32:22.260 --> 32:24.580
tacos, that was the end.

32:24.630 --> 32:26.342
Homosexuality has always
(eerie music)

32:26.392 --> 32:30.170
signaled the downfall
of a once great society.

32:30.220 --> 32:32.721
Which won't happen under
my watch, believe me.

32:32.771 --> 32:34.520
Believe me, trust me okay.

32:34.570 --> 32:37.700
But anyway, Kanye thank you

32:37.750 --> 32:42.750
for speaking the truth
about me and black people.

32:42.804 --> 32:45.440
-  Ooh, if I could
just punch his face just once!

32:45.490 --> 32:46.550
Just once!

32:46.600 --> 32:48.319
Punch him, I'd knock his ass out,

32:48.369 --> 32:50.772
I swear to God!

32:50.822 --> 32:53.489
(bells ringing)

33:10.336 --> 33:13.169
(camera shudders)

33:19.616 --> 33:22.737
(dramatic music)
(screaming)

33:22.787 --> 33:26.490
- Oh Blanca, you scared
the shit out of me!

33:26.540 --> 33:28.680
- It's just a stupid presidents mask.

33:28.730 --> 33:30.280
They're handing them out like candy.

33:30.330 --> 33:31.230
You want it?

33:31.280 --> 33:33.003
- No, not on my dead body.

33:39.521 --> 33:40.354
- Okay.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.680
- Is that the fiesta box?

33:46.730 --> 33:48.483
- Mm hmm, check this out.

33:50.350 --> 33:53.053
We have about six of these.

33:54.970 --> 33:56.460
Oh and that's just the main course.

33:56.510 --> 33:58.300
We also have some nutritious veggies.

33:58.350 --> 34:00.990
- Oh my God, this doesn't
even qualify as prison food.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.840
- And a bottle of milk
that expired last month.

34:04.890 --> 34:06.020
- Wow.

34:06.070 --> 34:07.890
- Oh, and let's not forget.

34:07.940 --> 34:10.440
Desert!

34:10.489 --> 34:12.989
- Okay, we're going to the
grocery store right now

34:13.040 --> 34:14.620
and I'm gonna stock you
and Pepe up with food.

34:14.670 --> 34:16.600
'Cause this is just fucking stupid.

34:16.650 --> 34:17.590
- For real?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.790
- Of course, I'll put
it on my credit card.

34:20.974 --> 34:22.474
- You're the best.

34:24.197 --> 34:26.110
Okay, I take back all the bad things

34:26.159 --> 34:27.603
I ever said about Muslims.

34:27.654 --> 34:29.904
(laughing)

34:31.014 --> 34:33.489
(ominous music)

34:33.540 --> 34:36.790
- I command the forces of darkness

34:36.840 --> 34:41.290
to bestow their infernal powers upon us.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.139
God of the earth, Lord of the world,

34:46.620 --> 34:48.360
open thy the gates of hell

34:48.409 --> 34:51.733
so that your son, the devil incarnate,

34:52.719 --> 34:55.010
Prince of Darkness,

34:55.060 --> 34:56.920
may deliver unto your temple

34:57.777 --> 35:01.630
the unholy, the unclean,

35:01.680 --> 35:03.960
the deviant, the repellent spirits

35:04.010 --> 35:07.120
that are God's mistakes that violate

35:07.170 --> 35:08.943
this righteous world.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.910
Bestow this elixir,

35:12.960 --> 35:16.420
plus the essence of your supreme power,

35:16.470 --> 35:19.190
so that your exultant spawns reign

35:19.240 --> 35:20.833
shall burn eternal.

35:22.324 --> 35:26.528
(singing in foreign language)

35:26.578 --> 35:27.411
David,

35:28.740 --> 35:30.493
you've been doing great work.

35:34.870 --> 35:37.950
But you have to yet reach
your full potential.

35:40.281 --> 35:42.539
(eerie music)

35:42.589 --> 35:43.853
Where there was light,

35:43.903 --> 35:47.794
there will now be darkness.
(loud sipping)

35:47.844 --> 35:48.894
Where there was calm,

35:50.098 --> 35:52.098
there will now be chaos.

35:53.573 --> 35:55.573
And when there was love,

35:56.710 --> 35:58.793
there will now be hatred.

35:59.786 --> 36:03.619
(singing in foreign language)

36:11.447 --> 36:14.576
David, you have been unleashed.

36:14.626 --> 36:19.626
Let the purge begin.

36:20.422 --> 36:25.422
(dramatic music)
(laughing)

36:38.698 --> 36:40.115
-  Guys!

36:42.960 --> 36:44.238
- I love it!
(laughing)

36:44.288 --> 36:45.470
-  Awesome.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.070
- What do you think about mine?

36:53.067 --> 36:55.750
- It's so good, I hope
he tweets about that.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.050
(laughing)

37:02.990 --> 37:05.830
- You have got to be the
happiest person I know.

37:05.880 --> 37:08.560
- Well, my mama always said that

37:08.610 --> 37:10.060
ever since I came out of the womb

37:10.110 --> 37:10.980
I was smiling.

37:11.030 --> 37:13.940
Not even after the doctor
slapped me, I didn't cry.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.320
I did not.

37:15.370 --> 37:17.870
And I haven't stopped smiling ever since.

37:17.920 --> 37:21.020
You know, I just feel like
amid all the bad times

37:21.070 --> 37:25.670
I had to find something
to, you know, celebrate

37:25.720 --> 37:26.503
and laugh about.

37:26.553 --> 37:28.260
Even if it's that piece of shit

37:28.310 --> 37:29.860
President of the United States.

37:31.633 --> 37:33.550
You know, I came into
this world with a smile,

37:33.600 --> 37:35.303
and I plan to go out the same way.

37:42.493 --> 37:45.360
- Well would you lookie lookie here.

37:45.410 --> 37:50.080
A Haitian, a Muslim,
and a God damn Mexican!

37:50.130 --> 37:53.340
Making America less God damn American.

37:53.390 --> 37:55.120
- Oh Porter and Sorenson,

37:55.170 --> 37:58.223
two dumb ass rednecks
making America, puke.

37:59.670 --> 38:01.280
- What are you guys doing here?

38:01.330 --> 38:03.163
- We're just here to watch the tryouts.

38:04.688 --> 38:06.120
- Sorry Porter.

38:06.170 --> 38:07.953
- You guys aren't trying out are you?

38:12.120 --> 38:13.300
That's a God damn relief.

38:13.350 --> 38:16.800
You see, seeing dark meat
in little skimpy outfit,

38:16.850 --> 38:18.077
is just (imitates vomiting).

38:25.293 --> 38:27.710
I see you're prepping another

38:27.760 --> 38:29.900
hate-filled joke of a libetard rally aye?

38:29.950 --> 38:32.671
- Yes, and you Republicunts
are the punchline.

38:32.721 --> 38:34.667
(laughing)

38:34.717 --> 38:35.790
- We're fighting for democracy.

38:35.840 --> 38:38.110
- Oh, don't you spooks realize?

38:38.160 --> 38:40.440
Every time you pull one of these stunts,

38:40.490 --> 38:43.580
makes us real Americans want you

38:43.630 --> 38:45.378
out of our country even more?

38:45.428 --> 38:46.211
Hmm?

38:46.261 --> 38:47.044
You ever think about that?

38:47.094 --> 38:48.540
- Ever heard of the constitution?

38:48.590 --> 38:49.950
- Constitution?

38:50.000 --> 38:50.833
Constitution?

38:51.667 --> 38:52.846
I don't know.

38:52.896 --> 38:53.880
- Do you even know what's in it?

38:53.930 --> 38:55.720
- I know my people wrote it.

38:55.770 --> 38:56.860
We the people.

38:56.910 --> 39:00.125
- Okay then, what does
the 15th amendment say?

39:00.175 --> 39:01.008
- Uh, 15?

39:03.908 --> 39:04.691
- Medjine.

39:04.741 --> 39:06.970
- The right to vote for all citizens.

39:07.020 --> 39:08.570
- How about the 14th amendment?

39:10.640 --> 39:11.670
- Blanca?

39:11.720 --> 39:14.200
- All persons born in the
United States are citizens.

39:14.250 --> 39:15.590
With equal protection under the law

39:15.640 --> 39:17.798
you stupid motherfuckers!

39:17.848 --> 39:20.100
(speaks foreign language)

39:20.150 --> 39:22.220
- Look Pocahontas, I hate
to spoil your pinata here,

39:22.270 --> 39:24.280
but just 'cause you can
quote the constitution

39:24.330 --> 39:26.060
doesn't make you a true American.

39:26.110 --> 39:27.240
- How about my brother?

39:27.290 --> 39:29.070
He's a Lance Corporal
in Afghanistan fighting

39:29.120 --> 39:31.390
for your rights to be an assholes.

39:31.440 --> 39:33.810
- Mm hmm, and the only thing
you and him are good for,

39:33.860 --> 39:36.760
is going out on the front lines
and taking bullets for us.

39:38.014 --> 39:40.858
And mowing our state
lawns, trimming our hedges,

39:40.908 --> 39:44.570
cleaning our pools, and washing my BMW.

39:44.620 --> 39:45.910
- Wax on, wax off.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.540
- You know you're a real
piece of shit right?

39:47.590 --> 39:48.373
- Whoa!

39:48.423 --> 39:50.880
Where is all the
tolerance on the left huh?

39:50.930 --> 39:53.013
Look, don't hate us 'cause we're white.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.780
Just 'cause you got the
shit end of the stick.

39:55.830 --> 39:57.300
And you wanna know why?

39:57.350 --> 39:58.290
- Oh please.

39:58.340 --> 39:59.963
- God loves white people!

40:00.890 --> 40:03.220
He gave us power, wealth,

40:03.270 --> 40:04.350
superior intelligence,

40:04.400 --> 40:06.330
and might I say God damn good looks.

40:06.380 --> 40:07.680
- You do look good Porter.

40:09.260 --> 40:10.180
Sorry.

40:10.230 --> 40:11.830
- And that obviously trumps you.

40:14.202 --> 40:16.370
Pissed 'em off now.

40:16.420 --> 40:17.520
- The only thing that's gonna get trumped

40:17.570 --> 40:19.890
is your dumb asses if you
don't leave right now.

40:19.940 --> 40:21.680
- Ooh, a threat of violence?

40:21.730 --> 40:22.950
Not that I'm surprised.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.870
Minorities are 10 times more likely

40:24.920 --> 40:26.170
to commit violent crimes.

40:26.220 --> 40:27.063
- That's a fact.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.450
- Go ahead spook.

40:30.480 --> 40:31.480
Take the first shot.

40:34.480 --> 40:36.813
(screaming)

40:38.050 --> 40:39.492
- Breathe, breathe, are you okay?

40:39.542 --> 40:42.077
- What the fuck man!

40:42.127 --> 40:46.500
Holy teeth, they knocked
out my front tooth!

40:46.550 --> 40:48.907
(screaming)

40:48.957 --> 40:53.957
(loud punching)
(fast paced music)

41:07.860 --> 41:10.200
- Alright ladies, our job's done here.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.800
Let's go to your place Medjine.

41:13.655 --> 41:14.488
- Hey.

41:16.352 --> 41:18.602
(groaning)

41:20.902 --> 41:23.819
(slow paced music)

41:52.441 --> 41:57.441
(ominous music)
(heavy breathing)

42:14.574 --> 42:16.741
(beeping)

42:51.369 --> 42:52.202
- Hey!

42:56.177 --> 42:57.594
-  Oh yeah!

43:02.697 --> 43:03.883
-  I love you too.

43:03.933 --> 43:05.560
I know you love me, I do.

43:05.610 --> 43:06.499
Thank you.

43:06.549 --> 43:08.470
Oh these resistors huh?

43:08.520 --> 43:09.680
They love to resist.

43:09.730 --> 43:11.700
- Do we have to watch this?

43:11.750 --> 43:12.833
He scares me.

43:14.260 --> 43:16.823
- That is precisely why we must watch.

43:19.659 --> 43:22.510
(laughing)

43:22.560 --> 43:24.720
- Sorry to bother you Sheriff Mueller but

43:24.770 --> 43:27.910
my dad never came home today
and my mom's really worried.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.400
It's not like him.

43:29.450 --> 43:31.170
- Lana, where was he last seen?

43:31.220 --> 43:33.460
- He went to the McDaniel's
house to fix the lock.

43:33.510 --> 43:35.350
That's the last we heard from him.

43:35.400 --> 43:38.334
- Okay, I'll check it out
and I'll get back to you.

43:38.384 --> 43:40.051
- Thank you so much.

43:41.210 --> 43:42.043
Bye.

43:44.144 --> 43:44.927
-  I was like you go boy.

43:44.977 --> 43:46.090
You be yourself okay?

43:50.440 --> 43:52.570
I called for a total and complete

43:52.620 --> 43:55.430
shutdown of Muslims,
Mexicans, and Haitians

43:55.480 --> 43:57.710
entering out great nation.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.550
No more illiterate, immoral,

43:59.600 --> 44:01.840
and unprincipled coming here

44:01.890 --> 44:04.990
to contaminate our Christian values.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.210
- Who's illiterate,
immoral, and unprincipled?

44:07.260 --> 44:09.920
-  I say only
bring in quality individuals

44:09.970 --> 44:11.750
from you know, places like Sweden,

44:11.800 --> 44:13.700
Denmark, Finland.

44:13.750 --> 44:16.947
Respectable blonde-haired, blue-eyed--

44:17.809 --> 44:19.980
(speaks in foreign language)

44:20.030 --> 44:23.680
Let's remove those brown
stains on Americas teeth

44:23.730 --> 44:26.024
and make them pearly white again.

44:26.074 --> 44:28.230
- By those standards, Jesus Christ

44:28.280 --> 44:29.739
wouldn't even get a Visa to come here.

44:29.789 --> 44:32.754
- Yeah.
(cheering)

44:32.804 --> 44:33.873
(doorbell rings)

44:33.923 --> 44:35.673
- Oh, Gabriel's here!

44:39.055 --> 44:41.805
(dramatic music)

44:43.186 --> 44:44.694
- Hey, don't mind her,

44:44.744 --> 44:47.968
she's been seeing ghost
presidents all day.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.315
- So good to see you.

44:50.365 --> 44:52.532
- Hey buddy, how ya doing?

44:53.548 --> 44:55.186
- Gabriel, why the hell are you wearing

44:55.236 --> 44:57.310
this frickin' President suit?

44:57.360 --> 44:59.100
- My sadistic way of protesting.

45:01.293 --> 45:03.160
- Is this gun real?

45:03.210 --> 45:04.560
- Sure is.

45:04.610 --> 45:05.900
Locked and loaded.

45:05.950 --> 45:09.190
In case we get raided for
being just who we are.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.340
- Did you bring them, did you bring them?

45:10.390 --> 45:11.734
- Sure did.

45:11.784 --> 45:13.117
-  Yes.

45:15.098 --> 45:16.360
- Here they are.
(everyone gasping)

45:16.410 --> 45:19.193
- My God Gabriel, we're so proud of you.

45:20.312 --> 45:21.513
- How did you get those?

45:22.740 --> 45:24.960
- Well, for the purple heart,

45:25.010 --> 45:27.010
I pulled my team leader to safety

45:28.260 --> 45:29.810
when he came under sniper fire.

45:31.130 --> 45:33.150
Taking bullets to my shoulder.

45:33.200 --> 45:34.073
- Can I see?

45:35.736 --> 45:36.569
- Okay.

45:41.654 --> 45:42.972
-  Whoa!

45:43.022 --> 45:45.140
- That really must've hurt.

45:45.190 --> 45:47.230
- As for the silver star,

45:47.280 --> 45:49.400
my team came under heavy fire.

45:49.450 --> 45:50.890
Most of my comrades were hit

45:51.776 --> 45:53.120
and wounded.

45:53.170 --> 45:54.900
- What did you do?

45:54.950 --> 45:56.970
- I commandeered one
of the enemies vehicles

45:57.020 --> 45:59.260
and I scooped up as many of the wounded

45:59.310 --> 46:00.733
soldiers as I could.

46:01.690 --> 46:03.020
Got them to safety.

46:03.070 --> 46:04.730
- How many did you save?

46:04.780 --> 46:05.670
- 15.

46:05.720 --> 46:07.060
- Holy shit, that's ballsy.

46:07.110 --> 46:10.490
- It really isn't Blanca.

46:10.540 --> 46:11.760
It's expected.

46:11.810 --> 46:13.300
It's our duty.

46:13.350 --> 46:15.590
It's what every man and woman in uniform

46:15.640 --> 46:17.180
would do for each other

46:17.230 --> 46:19.153
in a similar situation.

46:19.203 --> 46:21.670
- You don't have to go back do you?

46:21.720 --> 46:22.553
- If asked.

46:24.070 --> 46:26.340
But after receiving my silver star,

46:26.390 --> 46:27.970
I was relieved of duty

46:28.020 --> 46:30.010
and booted out of the military.

46:30.060 --> 46:31.680
- But you're a war hero.

46:31.730 --> 46:33.560
- See, our Republican party

46:33.610 --> 46:36.980
decided that transgenders are an intrusion

46:37.030 --> 46:38.513
and unfit to serve.

46:40.460 --> 46:42.163
So a ban was put into place.

46:44.935 --> 46:47.700
- What's a transgender?

46:47.750 --> 46:50.960
- Someone who's feelings
about their gender

46:52.390 --> 46:53.763
don't match their bodies.

46:54.860 --> 46:56.480
- Well, it sounds to me like a transgender

46:56.530 --> 46:58.470
is someone who saves many lives.

46:58.520 --> 46:59.403
A hero!

47:00.800 --> 47:02.780
- Unfortunately Pepe,

47:02.830 --> 47:04.790
there are many people in this world

47:04.840 --> 47:08.760
who act on the fears of
what they don't understand.

47:08.810 --> 47:09.643
Or agree with.

47:11.400 --> 47:13.680
I generally refer to them as--

47:13.730 --> 47:14.682
- Fucking assholes!

47:14.732 --> 47:17.754
(laughing)

47:17.804 --> 47:19.660
- Yeah, how'd you know?

47:19.710 --> 47:21.405
- Well, Lana has been teaching me

47:21.455 --> 47:23.850
all about them today.

47:23.900 --> 47:24.900
- Yeah Pepe.

47:39.930 --> 47:42.597
(ominous music)

47:59.798 --> 48:02.048
(creaking)

48:17.986 --> 48:20.653
(flies buzzing)

48:27.809 --> 48:32.809
(clanking)
(suspenseful music)

48:51.560 --> 48:52.977
- Freeze, police!

49:01.524 --> 49:03.423
(ominous music)

49:03.473 --> 49:04.713
Who the hell are you?

49:06.380 --> 49:07.470
What's going on here?

49:07.520 --> 49:08.600
- I assure you officer,

49:08.650 --> 49:09.593
I am no threat.

49:10.650 --> 49:11.483
I'm a doctor.

49:12.420 --> 49:13.423
- Easy!

49:14.890 --> 49:16.050
- My badge.

49:16.100 --> 49:16.933
- Nice and slow.

49:21.700 --> 49:24.803
- Dr. Lutin of the Lar-A-Margo Sanitarium.

49:25.660 --> 49:27.630
I've been looking for my patient.

49:27.680 --> 49:28.990
- And why the hell would he come here?

49:29.040 --> 49:30.775
- He was born here.

49:30.825 --> 49:31.658
In this room.

49:33.150 --> 49:34.570
David Barron.

49:34.620 --> 49:35.580
- David Barron?

49:35.630 --> 49:36.760
- You know of him.

49:36.810 --> 49:37.643
- I sure do.

49:39.100 --> 49:41.300
His mother was a porn star

49:41.350 --> 49:42.970
who birthed a billionaire son

49:43.880 --> 49:46.353
and then blackmailed the
guy into marrying her.

49:51.610 --> 49:52.493
Is that him?

49:54.460 --> 49:55.603
- Yes.

49:58.750 --> 50:00.710
- A man has gone missing.

50:00.760 --> 50:03.703
He was last reported
walking into this house.

50:05.503 --> 50:06.286
Now you wouldn't happen to know

50:06.336 --> 50:07.660
anything about that would you?

50:07.710 --> 50:08.717
- I've been here most of the day

50:08.767 --> 50:10.067
and I haven't seen anyone.

50:33.476 --> 50:36.393
(faint whispering)

50:38.138 --> 50:40.305
- Elixir from Tana Leaves.

50:41.560 --> 50:43.680
Nine to be exact.

50:43.730 --> 50:45.860
- I don't know what that means.

50:45.910 --> 50:48.950
- The extract was used in ancient times

50:49.000 --> 50:51.320
during Satanic rituals.

50:51.370 --> 50:53.980
A high priest would use the potion

50:54.030 --> 50:56.490
to induce any living mummy or demon--

50:56.540 --> 50:58.823
- Know something about demons Mr. Mueller?

50:59.750 --> 51:02.820
- In my younger years I
did some work for the RNC.

51:02.870 --> 51:05.770
- All of this is beyond my understanding.

51:05.820 --> 51:10.613
You see, David was
heavily into the occult.

51:12.210 --> 51:13.910
- And you think he's coming back here?

51:13.960 --> 51:14.970
- I think he will.

51:15.020 --> 51:15.853
- Maybe not.

51:16.810 --> 51:19.979
Maybe this is exactly what he's expecting.

51:20.029 --> 51:23.029
(suspenseful music)

51:26.480 --> 51:30.190
- This is one fucked up
cabinet that I've ever seen.

51:30.240 --> 51:31.200
- You're right, it is.

51:31.250 --> 51:34.500
- Correction, the second
most fucked up cabinet.

51:34.550 --> 51:35.974
Where are the spices?

51:36.024 --> 51:37.641
- I'm sorry, I'm all out.

51:37.691 --> 51:39.429
- Ah, I have some at my place.

51:39.479 --> 51:41.166
- No, I'll get it, I'll get it.

51:41.216 --> 51:42.307
- No, that's okay.

51:42.357 --> 51:44.043
- Relax war hero.

51:44.093 --> 51:44.926
Keys?

51:46.876 --> 51:49.376
(light music)

52:02.551 --> 52:04.887
-  Okay, pull it tight here.

52:04.937 --> 52:06.000
- Alright.

52:06.050 --> 52:07.893
- Now, lean into it.

52:09.840 --> 52:11.313
Check the back blaster here.

52:13.499 --> 52:15.060
- Got it.

52:15.110 --> 52:18.360
- Then pull the trigger arming handle

52:18.410 --> 52:19.473
to the on position.

52:21.600 --> 52:22.433
- What's this?

52:23.450 --> 52:25.670
- That's the infrared laser sight.

52:25.720 --> 52:27.270
You don't wanna mess with that.

52:28.720 --> 52:29.960
- You started this.

52:30.010 --> 52:32.493
Show me everything, I can handle myself.

52:33.600 --> 52:34.970
- Yeah, I noticed.

52:35.020 --> 52:35.803
- Oh, Aliens!

52:35.853 --> 52:37.233
Fucking aliens!

52:37.283 --> 52:38.066
- You got it.

52:38.116 --> 52:39.360
- It's our turn!

52:39.410 --> 52:41.740
-  Go after them, it feels good.

52:41.790 --> 52:43.450
And people see you doing it.

52:43.500 --> 52:45.350
I always get even.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.130
- Getting even by having your attorneys

52:47.180 --> 52:50.992
and deluded supporters do
your dirty work for you?

52:51.042 --> 52:51.850
Ha, yeah!

52:51.900 --> 52:54.846
You know what Medjine, you
just have to laugh it off.

52:54.896 --> 52:55.843
(laughing)

52:55.893 --> 52:58.980
-  My wall, the
one paid for by Mexico,

52:59.030 --> 53:01.213
will be beautiful.

53:01.263 --> 53:02.046
- How?

53:02.096 --> 53:03.761
Oh right, by having it covered with nude

53:03.811 --> 53:06.634
photos of Eastern European women.

53:06.684 --> 53:07.650
-  And it must be tall.

53:07.700 --> 53:10.280
Because Mexican immigrants
are professional

53:10.330 --> 53:11.646
mountain climbers.

53:11.696 --> 53:12.479
Oh they're good.

53:12.529 --> 53:16.689
- Gabriel!

53:16.739 --> 53:19.906
Thanks Gabriel, I could use your help.

53:24.155 --> 53:26.822
(ominous music)

53:36.244 --> 53:37.077
Oh.

53:39.510 --> 53:41.653
-  I will absolutely apologize

53:41.703 --> 53:43.940
sometime in the distant future

53:43.990 --> 53:45.370
if I'm ever wrong.

53:45.420 --> 53:47.073
- Oh my God, what an idiot.

53:48.213 --> 53:50.869
(ominous music)

53:50.919 --> 53:52.103
- Put down the gun.

53:54.250 --> 53:55.643
- What's in the box?

53:57.775 --> 53:59.300
- Just give me the gun David.

53:59.350 --> 54:00.931
- What's in the box?

54:00.981 --> 54:02.499
- Give me the gun.

54:02.549 --> 54:04.974
- What's in the box!

54:05.024 --> 54:07.892
-  Seven!

54:07.942 --> 54:09.765
-  Got it!

54:09.815 --> 54:11.361
-  Sorry losers.

54:11.411 --> 54:12.859
- Oh my God, I can't stand him!

54:12.909 --> 54:15.770
-  But my IQ
is one of the highest.

54:15.820 --> 54:17.373
And you all know it.

54:18.514 --> 54:20.850
Please don't feel stupid or insecure.

54:20.900 --> 54:22.480
- Oh my God, he's such an idiot.

54:22.530 --> 54:24.412
-  It's not your fault.

54:24.462 --> 54:26.657
- I cannot believe he got elected.

54:26.707 --> 54:28.650
-  Are we tired of winning yet?

54:28.700 --> 54:29.710
- You're hysterical.

54:29.760 --> 54:31.990
You should do stand up.

54:32.040 --> 54:33.598
(ominous music)

54:33.648 --> 54:35.815
(gasping)

54:40.109 --> 54:45.109
You're killing me.

54:48.084 --> 54:50.116
- I've been trying to call them.

54:50.166 --> 54:52.142
I don't know where they are.

54:52.192 --> 54:54.775
I don't know how they're doing.

54:55.913 --> 54:58.129
They won't give me any information.

54:58.179 --> 55:00.179
- Hey, shouldn't Medjine be back by now?

55:01.240 --> 55:03.380
- Yeah, what's keeping her?

55:03.430 --> 55:05.203
- I tried calling but no answer.

55:07.380 --> 55:10.140
I'll go check on her, be right back.

55:10.190 --> 55:11.667
-  Black people love me.

55:11.717 --> 55:13.794
Yellow people love me.

55:13.844 --> 55:15.970
Orange people love me.
(ominous music)

55:16.020 --> 55:18.786
Blue people love me.

55:18.836 --> 55:19.669
- Medjine!

55:20.791 --> 55:24.357
-  I'm not
racist because I'm not.

55:24.407 --> 55:27.550
Let's talk about black
unemployment rates okay.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.566
-  Medjine?

55:29.616 --> 55:31.873
-  Lowest it's ever been.

55:31.923 --> 55:32.756
- Medjine.

55:33.998 --> 55:36.665
(ominous music)

55:47.057 --> 55:47.890
Medjine?

55:55.064 --> 55:56.960
(loud thumping)

55:57.010 --> 55:59.677
(ominous music)

56:19.113 --> 56:22.030
(triumphant music)

56:48.493 --> 56:51.160
(ominous music)

57:03.589 --> 57:05.839
(cracking)

57:06.992 --> 57:09.659
(loud punching)

57:23.245 --> 57:25.112
-  Remember a
time when boys were boys

57:25.162 --> 57:26.948
and girls were girls?

57:26.998 --> 57:28.699
That time has gone.

57:28.749 --> 57:31.150
Now we've got boy girl combos.

57:31.200 --> 57:32.190
What do we call them?

57:32.240 --> 57:34.407
Tranny, he-she, it,

57:35.370 --> 57:37.300
she-male, transvestite,

57:37.350 --> 57:39.900
man in a dress, hermaphrodite,

57:39.950 --> 57:41.750
chick with a dick.

57:41.800 --> 57:42.633
They're freaks.

57:44.071 --> 57:46.740
And people who like them
are even sicker okay.

57:47.880 --> 57:52.090
Transgenders are pure unadulterated evil.

57:52.140 --> 57:52.973
Okay.

57:56.830 --> 57:57.663
- Anything?

57:59.120 --> 57:59.953
- No answer.

58:01.095 --> 58:01.920
- You think it's a prank?

58:01.970 --> 58:04.450
- If it is, that bitch is
gonna get a piece of my mind.

58:04.500 --> 58:06.300
I'm going over there, I'll call you.

58:24.796 --> 58:25.629
Medjine.

58:26.557 --> 58:28.059
Gabriel.

58:28.109 --> 58:29.630
-  An alarming rate okay.

58:29.680 --> 58:31.503
It's skyrocketed through the roof.

58:31.553 --> 58:33.375
- Come on guys, quit playing!

58:33.425 --> 58:35.240
-  No pun intended okay.

58:35.290 --> 58:37.060
What else do you want
from me black people?

58:37.110 --> 58:39.735
What else do you want from me?

58:39.785 --> 58:40.972
- Medjine!

58:41.022 --> 58:44.939
(speaking in foreign language)

58:50.606 --> 58:51.773
What the fuck?

58:55.220 --> 58:56.053
Medjine?

58:59.880 --> 59:01.139
Medjine!

59:01.189 --> 59:03.924
Gabriel answer me now
or I'm calling the cops!

59:03.974 --> 59:05.822
-  Hilary's day off.

59:05.872 --> 59:06.908
Oh believe me.

59:06.958 --> 59:09.307
(dramatic music)

59:09.357 --> 59:11.120
- Oh, thank God Gabriel.

59:11.170 --> 59:12.303
You scared the shit out of me.

59:12.353 --> 59:13.686
Where's Medjine?

59:16.907 --> 59:18.657
Gabriel, is that you?

59:20.709 --> 59:23.459
(dramatic music)

59:38.033 --> 59:40.283
(clanking)

59:46.715 --> 59:49.215
(eerie music)

59:53.953 --> 59:54.786
Shit.

01:00:18.562 --> 01:00:19.468
Damn it!

01:00:19.518 --> 01:00:21.518
A wall, are you serious!

01:00:51.053 --> 01:00:52.470
Yes Gabriel, yes!

01:00:55.393 --> 01:00:59.060
(speaking foreign language)

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:08.666
(mexican music)

01:01:15.645 --> 01:01:16.478
Fuck you!

01:01:21.174 --> 01:01:25.007
(singing in foreign language)

01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:43.158
Woo!

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:44.041
Yes!

01:01:45.276 --> 01:01:48.276
(suspenseful music)

01:01:50.747 --> 01:01:54.173
Some day soon, my people
will remember your people!

01:01:54.223 --> 01:01:56.056
Your time's almost up!

01:01:57.456 --> 01:01:59.706
(groaning)

01:02:10.514 --> 01:02:12.712
- Sheriff Mueller, any
word from my father yet?

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.290
- No Lana, not yet.

01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:15.660
- I think there's something strange going

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:17.560
on at the house across the street.

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:18.540
My friends are all there and none

01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.639
of them are answering their phones.

01:02:20.689 --> 01:02:22.020
- Okay.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.017
I'll check it out.

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:28.786
Okay doctor, you're coming with me.

01:02:28.836 --> 01:02:30.173
- Of course.

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.983
-  We have great
relationships with China.

01:02:36.081 --> 01:02:38.998
(melancholy music)

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.930
I mean they love me, I love them.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:11.647
Long long time okay?

01:03:13.234 --> 01:03:15.734
Me and the president of China.

01:03:16.627 --> 01:03:19.210
One more time, we're tight now.

01:03:21.312 --> 01:03:22.979
Around a mouse okay.

01:03:24.494 --> 01:03:27.769
We had a long long discussion.

01:03:27.819 --> 01:03:29.113
- Lana.

01:03:29.163 --> 01:03:30.353
I see Gabriel.

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:38.313
- Where?

01:03:38.363 --> 01:03:40.000
I don't see anything.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.990
- He was right there,
he was carrying Blanca.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.420
- Carrying Blanca?

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:45.690
Okay I'm going over there.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:47.096
Lock the door, I'll be back.

01:03:47.146 --> 01:03:48.154
- You can't leave me here by myself!

01:03:48.204 --> 01:03:49.841
- You'll be fine.

01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:50.674
- Please.

01:03:50.724 --> 01:03:53.474
- You'll be fine, you'll be fine.

01:04:00.553 --> 01:04:03.053
(eerie music)

01:04:33.055 --> 01:04:33.888
Medjine?

01:04:35.033 --> 01:04:37.350
-  And now
we're gonna get respect.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.223
- Guys, stop playing.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:41.633
Blanca?

01:04:43.777 --> 01:04:44.610
Gabriel?

01:04:49.528 --> 01:04:50.361
Medjine?

01:05:02.208 --> 01:05:04.875
(ominous music)

01:05:06.061 --> 01:05:06.894
Medjine?

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:12.453
Blanca?

01:05:16.672 --> 01:05:19.339
(door creaking)

01:05:25.828 --> 01:05:27.995
(sobbing)

01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:00.737
(ominous music)

01:06:22.951 --> 01:06:27.312
Yes operator, this is
Lana Shaheed, I need--

01:06:27.362 --> 01:06:28.469
(screaming)

01:06:28.519 --> 01:06:31.436
(fast paced music)

01:06:39.842 --> 01:06:42.759
(triumphant music)

01:06:45.151 --> 01:06:47.401
(growling)

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:55.977
No!

01:07:02.612 --> 01:07:03.445
No, no!

01:07:10.698 --> 01:07:11.865
- David, stop!

01:07:14.162 --> 01:07:15.745
- David, it's okay.

01:07:17.235 --> 01:07:18.152
Let her go.

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:23.938
- Sheriff Mueller.

01:07:25.019 --> 01:07:26.193
Sheriff Mueller, he killed my friends.

01:07:26.243 --> 01:07:27.873
They're in the bedroom.

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:32.170
- Doctor, step aside.

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:34.620
I'm placing this lunatic
under arrest right now.

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:39.260
- I suggest you lower your
weapon Sheriff Mueller.

01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:40.183
Or I shoot her.

01:07:41.070 --> 01:07:44.090
- Doctor, put the gun down.

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.240
- You have no idea who or what you're

01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:47.563
dealing with here do you?

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:51.050
This is no ordinary man.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.503
He is the embodiment of evil.

01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:56.080
The Prince of Darkness

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:58.590
whose reign will soon sweep the globe.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.880
- It'll be difficult to sweep anything

01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:01.740
from solitary confinement.

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:03.543
Doctor, put the gun down.

01:08:04.445 --> 01:08:05.612
- As you wish.

01:08:06.852 --> 01:08:09.769
(loud guns firing)

01:08:13.791 --> 01:08:14.708
- You okay?

01:08:15.618 --> 01:08:16.925
It's okay.

01:08:16.975 --> 01:08:20.058
The bullet just grazed your hip okay?

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:26.270
- I failed you David.
(solemn music)

01:08:26.321 --> 01:08:27.154
I'm sorry.

01:08:30.203 --> 01:08:33.622
I will miss our Sunday walks.

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.377
Your warm embrace.

01:09:26.622 --> 01:09:28.122
Goodbye my friend.

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.550
(ominous music)

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.462
- David.

01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:49.263
You stand your ground or I will shoot you.

01:09:49.313 --> 01:09:50.224
David.

01:09:50.274 --> 01:09:53.107
(loud gun firing)

01:09:58.541 --> 01:09:59.610
Okay, hang tight.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.690
I'm gonna go radio for an ambulance okay?

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:03.890
- Please check on Pepe,
he's at Medjine's house

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.399
across the street.

01:10:05.449 --> 01:10:06.282
- Okay.

01:10:18.386 --> 01:10:20.636
(grunting)

01:10:23.479 --> 01:10:24.262
(loud knocking)

01:10:24.312 --> 01:10:25.145
Sheriff, open up!

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.003
Whoa there Rambo.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.430
Let's go ahead and hand
that over to me okay?

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.169
-  Thank you so much.

01:10:35.219 --> 01:10:37.360
I love you, and again.

01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:39.553
- Don't tell me you know how to use this?

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:40.900
- It's Gabriel's.

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:42.800
He taught Lana how to use it tonight.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:45.960
Where's my sister?

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.123
Where's Lana?

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.400
- Let's talk little man, come on.

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:20.445

What the hell are you doing!

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.135
He's gonna kill me!

Help me, open the door, open the door.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.883
Please help me!

01:13:19.018 --> 01:13:20.980
- I'm sorry ma'am I can't do that.

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.170
I don't have keys to the door.

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.280
You're gonna have to go around!

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:24.660
- You don't understand,
he's gonna kill me!

01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:26.120
He's right there, break the glass!

01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:26.984
Do something.

01:13:27.034 --> 01:13:28.782
- I can't do that.

01:13:28.832 --> 01:13:29.989
- Why not?

01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:31.207
- Look, I wanna help you I really do

01:13:31.257 --> 01:13:32.674
but I just can't!

01:13:34.122 --> 01:13:38.577
I'm already this close
to being fired as it is.

01:13:38.627 --> 01:13:39.850
But I'll show them,

01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.123
I'm destined to do great things.

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.800
Who knows,

01:13:45.850 --> 01:13:48.450
one day I might even bring
peace to the Middle East.

01:13:49.713 --> 01:13:52.680
- Will you shut the fuck up
and call Sheriff Mueller.

01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:54.150
Tell him it's Lana Shaheed.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.805
Lana Shaheed.

01:13:55.855 --> 01:13:57.110
- Shaheed?

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.120
Isn't that Muslim?

01:13:58.170 --> 01:13:59.423

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.223

01:15:27.572 --> 01:15:28.620
-  Sheriff

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:31.070
a distress call from a young
woman asking for your help.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.820
Her name is Lana Shaheed.

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:35.080

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:35.913

01:15:47.331 --> 01:15:49.581
(grunting)

01:15:51.946 --> 01:15:53.363
- Leave me alone.

Sheriff Mueller, where'd you go?

01:16:26.169 --> 01:16:27.419
Where'd you go!

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:57.550
I had to tell Pepe about his sister.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.210

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:14.630
They didn't deserve this.

01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:19.200
- Just hang tight, the
ambulance is on it's way okay?

01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:24.743
- Can they stop by somewhere before we go?

01:18:27.096 --> 01:18:28.340
- What could you possibly want to do

01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:30.340
that's more important than your health?

01:18:33.326 --> 01:18:34.159
