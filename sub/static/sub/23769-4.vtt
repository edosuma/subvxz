[theme music playing]

01:17.720 --> 01:19.880
[Suzanne] Everyone, let's get out of here!

01:19.960 --> 01:21.920
-Come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
-[all screaming]

01:22.000 --> 01:23.680

-Jackie!

01:24.600 --> 01:26.800
[all screaming]

01:26.880 --> 01:28.840
-[Alex] Stay low!
-There's no answer!

01:28.920 --> 01:29.880
The whole network must be down!

01:29.960 --> 01:31.360
Aspen!

01:31.440 --> 01:33.200
[gasping] Help!

01:34.600 --> 01:36.880
-[exclaiming]
-Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no!

01:36.960 --> 01:39.080
-Where are you going?
-I have to check the engine room.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.760
-Well, I'm coming with you!
-No, stay here. It's safer.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.600
This thing is taking way too long!
There's no way this building can make it!

01:44.680 --> 01:45.720
Daniel!

01:47.520 --> 01:48.800
[Jason] Brooke! Get back to the clubhouse!

01:48.880 --> 01:50.520
-[Brooke] Daniel!
-Please everyone, take cover!

01:50.600 --> 01:52.000
Take cover! Please stay calm!

01:53.640 --> 01:55.280
My name is Sophie Cardona!

01:55.360 --> 01:59.600
I'm a student at the Greenhouse!
It is now 3:16 in the afternoon!

01:59.680 --> 02:02.240
-[pants and screams]
-Brooke! What are you doing?

02:02.320 --> 02:04.000
-I'm looking for Daniel!
-No. Stay with me.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.960
You're not going anywhere
until this is over!

02:06.040 --> 02:07.480
Help! Help!

02:08.680 --> 02:10.520
[gasping]

02:10.600 --> 02:12.880
[Leo] Hayley, I'm coming! Hang on!

02:27.720 --> 02:29.080
Keep swimming!

02:39.920 --> 02:42.600
Leo, grab the rope! I'm coming!

02:45.240 --> 02:46.640
Grab the rope!

02:50.960 --> 02:52.560
[Leo] Just keep swimming.
You gotta keep swimming.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.840
This is the longest earthquake
I can remember!

02:57.920 --> 03:00.840
-If we're gone and you find this video--
-Sophie, listen!

03:00.920 --> 03:03.000
I just want you to know
I've always wanted us to be together.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.720
Sophie, I love you!

03:05.800 --> 03:08.400
-[rumbling stops]
-[all grunting and panting]

03:10.840 --> 03:13.280
Tammy? Alex? You guys okay?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.040
-[Tammy] Yeah.
-I got you. I got you.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.400
[breathing heavily]

03:20.680 --> 03:23.960
[groans] Gosh.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.160

[EKG beeping]

03:44.800 --> 03:46.000
[sighs]

03:46.560 --> 03:48.560
Your resting pulse is back to normal.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.840
Blood pressure...

03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
stabilized.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.720
[sighs] I'm sorry.

03:58.160 --> 04:01.000
-[Judy] Marcus, where are you?
-[sighs]

04:11.960 --> 04:14.880
Oh, God. Okay. [sighs]
What took you so long?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.320
Had to check the servers too.

04:17.399 --> 04:20.279
-I hope for your sake that my son is safe.
-[line ringing]

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080

[Louie ringing]

04:32.680 --> 04:34.440
[Brooke] Daniel, where are you?

04:34.520 --> 04:35.760
[cries] Daniel!

04:41.000 --> 04:42.560
Daniel!

04:42.640 --> 04:45.800
Daniel. Thank God! I was freaking out.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.080
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.840
What were you doing in there?

04:48.920 --> 04:50.880
-Um, I was...
-[Louie ringing]

04:52.280 --> 04:54.720
-It's Judy.
-She's calling you?

04:55.640 --> 04:57.160
Hey, Mom.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.120
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

05:01.720 --> 05:02.560
Right.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.960
I'm with her now. Yeah.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.720
We did a sweep of the school.
Um, the students are safe.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.520
We've got maintenance clearing debris.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.680
-Any injuries?
-None. Thank God.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.240
-You okay?
-Yeah.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.400
All right, everyone. Listen up.
Come close. Come close.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.200
Don't think I've ever been so happy
to see anyone in my entire life.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.200
-Suzanne? Is everyone here?
-Yeah?

05:24.280 --> 05:27.200
The rest of the Ravens are
on their way back. Everybody's fine.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.600
Okay. Thank you. So we got lucky.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.160
This was a serious earthquake.

05:31.240 --> 05:33.480
But everything appears to be okay.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.240
We're all safe now. We'll schedule
extra emergency drills this month.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.280
-There might be aftershocks.
-[Jason] That's a good idea.

05:39.360 --> 05:43.800
[Louis] So, we should clean up and get
back to normal just as soon as we can.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.400
-[indistinct chatter]
-Okay.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.280
Can I help?

05:54.720 --> 05:56.480
I'm... I'm looking for something.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.840
Can I help you?

05:59.360 --> 06:02.000
Well, actually, it's Emma's chess set.

06:02.640 --> 06:05.000
Really? Why?

06:06.840 --> 06:10.240
It's a very delicate set and I wanted
to make sure it wasn't damaged.

06:10.320 --> 06:13.920
Oh, I'm pretty sure it wasn't.
I already mailed it off.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.960
Emma had requested I send it back to her.
So don't worry.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.040
Her precious chessboard was saved.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.360
Okay. You guys heard Louis.

06:26.440 --> 06:29.680
Let's clean this place up and try to get
back to normal as soon as possible, okay?

06:33.840 --> 06:35.240
So, did you find it?

06:36.760 --> 06:38.640
Jason said he had it mailed back to Emma.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.400
[sighs]

06:41.480 --> 06:43.280
[on speakers] My name is Sophie Cardona!

06:43.360 --> 06:46.000
-I'm a student at the Greenhouse! It--
-[Parker] Hey.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.040
It's still a huge mess, but we
got up most of the glass like you said.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.360
Thanks, Parker.

06:56.160 --> 07:01.720
So, uh... a 5.2 on the Richter scale.
That's pretty crazy, right?

07:01.800 --> 07:05.360
Yeah. I mean, to me, it felt
more like a 9.0, though. Right?

07:05.440 --> 07:07.840
Didn't it? It's scary.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.000
It was.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.160
So, um...

07:13.760 --> 07:15.160
what you doing?

07:15.240 --> 07:19.760
Well, I'm just, uh, uploading some videos.
This always takes forever.

07:19.840 --> 07:24.200
[clears throat] Listen,
about that... I kinda...

07:24.280 --> 07:25.960
You know, during the earthquake, I...

07:26.680 --> 07:28.800
I said some things that...

07:28.880 --> 07:31.400
-My head was just--
-It's okay, Parker.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.760
'Cause I'm... I... I just...
I feel like a complete idiot.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.560
No! No, you're not an idiot.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.880
-We were nervous, that's all.
-Yeah.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.480
I, uh... I actually thought
it was kinda cute.

07:47.480 --> 07:50.080
-[chuckles]
-It's cool?

07:50.160 --> 07:51.160
Yeah.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.520
So listen, you're not gonna show
anyone the video? Are you?

07:57.600 --> 08:00.840
-Oh, no. Oh, no, of course not! No.
-Okay. [sighs]

08:11.960 --> 08:13.160
[sniffles]

08:19.320 --> 08:20.360
How do you feel?

08:22.800 --> 08:24.280
I'm fine.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.360
How are you, Aspen?

08:28.440 --> 08:32.400
I'm fine. My hand hurts
a little bit, but who cares?

08:33.120 --> 08:35.240
The important thing
is that you're all right.

08:36.039 --> 08:39.200
-I didn't get a chance to thank you for--
-You don't have to.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.720
I did what anyone in that situation
would have done.

08:43.360 --> 08:47.480
You don't have time to think in a moment
like that. You just jump into action.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.680
[chuckles]

08:50.040 --> 08:51.320
Yeah, I guess.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.400
You know, I get goose bumps just...

08:55.240 --> 08:58.480
thinking about what would have happened if
I hadn't pulled you and Leo out of there.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.720
So morbid.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.360
Awful way to go.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.960
[indistinct chatter]

09:25.480 --> 09:28.560
-Hey, Michelle... did you see this?
-What is it?

09:28.640 --> 09:30.640
That is a video blog

09:30.720 --> 09:33.120
that was shot by one
of the students at the Greenhouse.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.760
She shot it during the earthquake. Here.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.000
My name is Sophie Cardona!

09:37.080 --> 09:38.960
I'm a student at the Greenhouse!

09:40.240 --> 09:42.920
This is the longest earthquake
that I can remember.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.880
Get me this girl on the phone right now.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.960
I thought you knew how to swim.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.040
It was a whirlpool. And I felt
like an ant going down the drain.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.200
And that nutcase just stared at you?

09:58.280 --> 10:01.520
[sighs] I don't know. It was hard to tell.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.360
But I could've sworn that she saw me.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.440
If Leo hadn't showed up,
then you wouldn't have a sister anymore.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.400
If anything happened to you,
I would've killed you.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.000
[both chuckle]

10:13.880 --> 10:17.000
You know, Louis was right about
what he said to you on the first day.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.200
-What?
-You are never gonna be bored here.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.320
[scoffs] Please.
I could use a couple of days of boredom.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.840
[Alex sighs]

10:30.960 --> 10:32.480
There's something else, Alex.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.560
When I was underwater...

10:38.040 --> 10:39.200
I saw something.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.760
You mean, the way people...

10:42.600 --> 10:45.800
say that your life flashes
before your eyes?

10:47.320 --> 10:50.000
Yeah, but not my life.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.080
I saw Mom.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.840
I can't believe I'm talking
to the Michelle Wallace.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.480
I can't believe I am talking
to the Sophie Cardona. I mean...

11:10.560 --> 11:12.080
you're in the middle of an earthquake

11:12.160 --> 11:14.920
and your first instinct
is to record a story?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
You remind me of myself
when I was your age.

11:17.080 --> 11:21.120
-Wow. Thank you so much!
-That is the mark of a great journalist.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.560
We're always on the lookout
for the next big story, right?

11:23.640 --> 11:28.840
[gasps] What? I'm sorry.
I just... I can't breathe.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.280
Relax, sweetie.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.520
In fact...

11:32.320 --> 11:35.160
I wanted to get your permission
to use your videos

11:35.240 --> 11:37.960
for tonight's lead story
on the earthquake.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.680
Uh... you're kidding, right?

11:40.760 --> 11:42.200
That is a yes, is it?

11:42.280 --> 11:44.480
-Yes! Yes, of course.
-Great.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.760
Oh, we're gonna need more footage,
though, as soon as possible.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.480
You do have some more, right?

11:48.560 --> 11:51.200
Sure. Yes. I will get right on it.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.120
-Great.
-Thank you.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.880
The Eagles are gonna be on TV!

12:00.760 --> 12:04.280
Okay, you were scared.
You thought you were drowning.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.680
I was drowning.

12:05.760 --> 12:09.760
Right. If I was in your position,
I would've imagined Mom, too.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.120
I didn't imagine her.
It's hard to explain. It felt...

12:16.360 --> 12:18.280
-What?
-Forget it.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.200
What is it?

12:21.960 --> 12:24.560
You remember how I used to get
so mad at Dad

12:24.640 --> 12:26.920
when he would talk about Mom
as if she's still alive?

12:28.400 --> 12:32.680
Well, what if he was right, you know?

12:32.760 --> 12:33.960
What do you mean?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.680
I really felt her presence.

12:39.840 --> 12:45.360
You do realize that this is all part
of this traumatic experience you've had?

12:45.440 --> 12:48.200
This is some form of PTSD.

12:48.280 --> 12:52.560
This isn't post traumatic shock, Alex.
I saw her.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.400
I swear.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.240
-So, what'd the nurse say?
-Uh, I'm fine. No concussion.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.520
Well, I know what will make you
healthy and strong.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.240
My dad's world-famous lasagna.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.520
But it's taco night at the cafeteria.

13:06.600 --> 13:10.720
No, silly, you're having dinner with us.
My dad invited you and your mom over.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.600
[cell phone chimes]

13:21.400 --> 13:23.920
Well, the client seems
very happy with our work.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.480
Happy? We almost destroyed the Greenhouse.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.720
But we didn't. We know the program works.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.760
That's why it's called a test run.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.880
And now, we know
the parameters for the program

13:36.960 --> 13:40.400
and can fix the glitches
before the next time.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.880
Hey, aren't you guys coming over
to watch Sophie on TV?

13:45.960 --> 13:48.160
-Yeah!
-[Parker] That's not fair!

13:48.240 --> 13:49.760
Hey. So how does it feel
to be a celebrity?

13:49.840 --> 13:55.200
Come on. I'm not the celebrity.
My story is the celebrity.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.840
-But it still feels great!
-[all laughing]

13:58.920 --> 14:01.480
Do you know what time your story will air?

14:02.280 --> 14:04.000
Oh, my God. No. I have no idea.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.840
Maybe you should call her and ask?

14:08.560 --> 14:09.760
-You think?
-Go.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.600
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Okay. All right.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.520
[cell phone vibrating]

14:20.000 --> 14:20.840
Yes?

14:20.920 --> 14:23.280
Oh, hey, uh, this is Sophie Cardona.

14:23.360 --> 14:27.600
I was just calling to see what time
my footage will air during the broadcast.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.880
Oh, didn't my assistant call you?

14:30.960 --> 14:32.040
Uh. No, why?

14:32.120 --> 14:33.240
I asked him to call you.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.200
We decided we're not
gonna use your footage.

14:35.280 --> 14:36.440
Our show is jam-packed.

14:36.520 --> 14:40.200
-I'm sorry about that.
-Oh. But I thought you liked it.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.800
I did, but when we watched it
in the cutting room, it felt a bit stale.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.720
Yeah, well,
I was in the middle of an earthquake.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.680
I know. We have a lot of footage
from the earthquake.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.120
I was looking for a story.
A point of view.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.680
Something emotional that our viewers
could connect with.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.840
What... what is this? A reality show?

14:54.920 --> 14:57.080
Everything's a reality show
these days, sweetie.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.040
Actually...

15:06.120 --> 15:09.040
there... there is some footage
that I never sent you.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.280
Is it good?

15:15.120 --> 15:16.720
Yeah, It's good.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.720
[sighs]

15:38.000 --> 15:39.680
[Louie ringing]

15:46.320 --> 15:47.320
Hey, Dad.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.760
Yeah. I'm on my way.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.480
[groans] What a day.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.520
Hmm. Ah, this lasagna smells so good.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.880
[chuckles] This is exactly what we needed.
Some comfort food.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.440
Brooke insists I should start up
a food truck if I ever retire.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.840
-[all chuckle]
-Yeah.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.360
You must be so proud of her.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.760
I am.

16:23.840 --> 16:26.920
He couldn't have picked
a sweeter girl. [chuckling]

16:27.000 --> 16:30.240
[sighs] I'm so happy
you two are back together.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.480
Me, too.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.200
We were meant to be.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.240
What's wrong?

16:39.320 --> 16:42.120
Uh, I thought you didn't believe in fate.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.400
You always talk about being
in control of your destiny.

16:46.560 --> 16:49.440
But some things are beyond your control.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.240
Daniel, you can't control love.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.320
Exactly.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.960
-Hello, everyone!
-[Brooke] Hey. Hello!

16:59.040 --> 17:01.000
-Hey, Jason.
-Hello, hello.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.160
Hey, Jason.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.599
-[Brooke] Mmm. Okay. Try this one.
-Thank you.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.119
[indistinct chatter]

17:12.200 --> 17:14.599
Oh, shh! It's starting!
It's starting. Shh!

17:16.200 --> 17:20.480
What would you do if a 5.2 earthquake
struck your school?

17:20.560 --> 17:22.640
-For Sophie Cardona...
-[all cheering]

17:22.720 --> 17:24.720
...a student
at the prestigious Greenhouse,

17:24.800 --> 17:29.600
her first instinct was to record
a selfie video of the entire event.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.680
Today's earthquake was actually
a highly localized microquake

17:33.760 --> 17:37.280
that only affected the five-mile campus
of the Greenhouse.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.760
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
and there was no structural damage.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.560
But for the Greenhouse students,

17:42.640 --> 17:46.280
let's just say that quake
rocked their world.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.680
This is the longest earthquake
that I can remember.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.520
It is now 3:16 in the afternoon. [panting]

17:51.600 --> 17:53.880
I'm so grateful
that none of our students got hurt.

17:53.960 --> 17:57.800
The Greenhouse is one of the most
competitive high schools in the country.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.880
The academy is famous
for training future leaders

18:00.960 --> 18:02.680
who are passionate about their ideals.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.640
Like the passionate Parker Grant,

18:04.720 --> 18:07.600
who isn't afraid to say
what's on his mind.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.040
Look, there's my boy!

18:09.120 --> 18:11.960
-If we're gone and you find this video--
-Sophie, listen!

18:12.040 --> 18:13.760
I don't think we're gonna
come out of this alive.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.000
I just want you to know
I've always wanted us to be together.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.520
Sophie, I love you!

18:25.600 --> 18:29.600
[Michelle] Welcome to Generation Viral,
where privacy is a thing of the past

18:29.680 --> 18:34.840
and today's teens live their lives
on-screen 24/7.
