WITH ACTIVITY.

01:23.028 --> 01:25.015

WHAT IS IT,

06:13.017 --> 06:16.020
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
IS A MICROSCOPIC ROBOT,

06:16.022 --> 06:18.020
A NANO BOT--

06:18.022 --> 06:20.010
NANO, WHICH IN LATIN
MEANS SMALL,

IS SHORT FOR ROBOT.

ARE CORRECT,

MILLIONS OF NANO BOTS
ARE RAINING DOWN ON TOWNSVILLE.

06:27.021 --> 06:32.006
IT'S JUST POSSIBLE THAT THESE

DOES NOTHING.
