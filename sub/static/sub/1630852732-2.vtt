00:17.392 --> 00:19.019
<i>Dad?</i>

00:19.102 --> 00:20.228
<i>No!</i>

00:33.283 --> 00:34.784
Die!

00:55.138 --> 00:57.932
<i>When Dion's power</i>
<i>struck that lightning rod,</i>

00:58.016 --> 01:02.479
<i>I could feel every molecule</i>
<i>of my body being torn apart.</i>

01:07.776 --> 01:11.029
<i>And then I was floating.</i>

01:39.474 --> 01:40.683


01:41.184 --> 01:43.394
<i>I didn't understand what happened.</i>

01:43.478 --> 01:47.023
<i>All I knew was one minute I was dead</i>,

01:48.358 --> 01:50.693
<i>and the next, I wasn't.</i>

01:54.989 --> 01:58.159
<i>It took a whole day</i>
<i>for my body to completely reform.</i>

02:01.329 --> 02:04.666
<i>And another day</i>
<i>to walk to the nearest town.</i>

02:16.886 --> 02:20.974
It was a quiet place off the beaten path.

02:21.057 --> 02:24.435
I didn't know anyone, but,
um, they didn't know me either,

02:24.519 --> 02:26.855
so I figured I could

02:27.647 --> 02:29.774
make a fresh start, put…

02:31.192 --> 02:33.027
…everything that happened behind me.

02:34.904 --> 02:38.700
So you spend two years
in this quaint little town, and then what?

02:45.456 --> 02:48.668
You realize you want your old life back?
Is that why you're here?

02:50.295 --> 02:51.337
I told you.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.090
I saw the Crooked Man.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.051
You <i>are</i> the Crooked Man, Pat.

02:57.135 --> 02:57.969
No. No.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.554
I'm not.

03:00.054 --> 03:04.392
I have lived two years
without that horror show inside me.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.312
I'm not him.

03:07.812 --> 03:08.730
Or-- Or "it."

03:08.813 --> 03:12.650
That wasn't me. And it's…
And it's gone now. I swear.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.861
Except you just saw it.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.822
Yes, same electricity, same power,

03:17.906 --> 03:20.366
but someone else has it now.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.743
That's impossible.

03:21.826 --> 03:25.288
Powers derive from mutated DNA.
They're not transferable.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.873
Well, I don't have powers anymore

03:26.956 --> 03:28.917
and I saw a video
of the Crooked Man on the news.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.377
It killed a guy in a parking lot.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.881
They said it was a freak lightning strike,
but I know what I saw.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.383
The guards are carrying
ionic charge suppressors.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.302
Either you tell me why you're really here,

03:39.385 --> 03:43.348
or they pull the trigger and drop
your core temperature 250 degrees.

03:43.431 --> 03:47.143
Suzanne, I'm telling you the truth.
We don't have time for this.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.437
The Crooked Man killed someone,

03:49.520 --> 03:51.189
and you can check for yourself!

03:56.569 --> 03:59.197
-That's really cold.
-Thank you.

03:59.697 --> 04:02.408
We developed the gun
to shut down your electrical form.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.745
Which would work
if I <i>had </i>an electrical charge,

04:05.828 --> 04:06.829
but I don't,

04:06.913 --> 04:09.415
because I already told you, I'm normal.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.383
You say you don't have powers.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.179
We're gonna run every test we have
to make sure that's true.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.266
Let's keep this quiet.

04:26.766 --> 04:30.061
I don't want a riot on my hands
from all the people whose lives he ruined.

04:34.065 --> 04:34.899
Suzanne?

04:38.069 --> 04:39.696
Suzanne, you have to believe me.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.200
There's another Crooked Man out there!

04:44.951 --> 04:47.245
Suzanne, please!

05:04.512 --> 05:05.847
Readings are normal.

05:06.347 --> 05:09.726
Whatever they were seeing
on the monitors last night, it's gone now.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.565
This is some weird stuff.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.652
Did you guys see these roots growing here?

05:20.361 --> 05:21.571
No.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.240
That's new.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.084
Oh, man, what is this?

05:38.379 --> 05:39.630
Someone's been down here.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.800
Maybe it was the security guard?

05:43.426 --> 05:45.845
Gary? I didn't see him last night.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.723
Let me give him a call.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.880
<i>This is Gary.</i>
<i>I can't make it to the phone--</i>

06:20.963 --> 06:23.424
-Where are you, Gary?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.677
Looks like we had
a visitor inside the sinkhole.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.263
-<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
Security guard is nowhere to be found.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.349
So we need to get somebody up here ASAP.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.559
-<i>Okay.</i>
-Can't have school kids falling in.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.852
<i>Copy that.</i>
-Okay.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.281
What do you think
they're doing down there?

06:49.033 --> 06:50.785
I think they're just testing.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.539
I don't know.
Maybe you should ask Ms. Suzanne.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.375
Suzanne said it was nothing,
so don't worry about it.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.378
-Have your backpack?
-Is Ms. Suzanne your friend?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.798
Well, I mean, at first she wasn't.

07:03.881 --> 07:06.717
But now, yeah, we're friends.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.386
What if she kept a secret from you?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.431
That would go against our agreement.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.434
We said if we were
gonna work together at BIONA,

07:14.517 --> 07:17.186
we'd be completely honest
with each other. No secrets.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.064
Why? What's this about?

07:21.482 --> 07:23.526
Something going on
with you and your friends?

07:23.609 --> 07:25.736
-Are you keeping a secret from somebody?
-No.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.115
-Is this about the musical?
-No, but I'm way too busy to do a musical.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.535
-With what?
-I have a trainer with superpowers!

07:32.618 --> 07:34.704
Why would I want to do anything else?

07:35.496 --> 07:38.040
-So you like Tevin?
-He has a force field power.

07:38.749 --> 07:39.709
Yeah, I've seen it.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.335
And he's really fast.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.005
He's a runner.
Maybe I should start running.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.424
Well, I'm glad you like Tevin.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.177
And Esperanza asked you to do the musical.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.555
She's always been there for you,
so don't let her down, okay?

07:54.515 --> 07:55.766
All right, scoot.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.022
-I love you.
-I love you too, Mom.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.114
Are those abs?

08:10.698 --> 08:15.578
No, they're s-special… power stabilizers
that help him go faster

08:15.661 --> 08:16.913
Okay.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.625
Can we please get back to business?

08:20.708 --> 08:23.711
Dion, did you tell your mom
about the sinkhole secret?

08:23.794 --> 08:26.422
I couldn't, 'cause then she'd know
I snuck out to get my phone.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.133
How are we going to find out
what the big mystery is?

08:29.926 --> 08:32.428
We could sneak down there
after school before pick-up.

08:32.512 --> 08:33.888
-I'm in.
-Excellent.

08:33.971 --> 08:37.642
I'll be the lookout.
Any other Triangle of Justice business?

08:37.725 --> 08:39.060
-Well--
-Great.

08:39.143 --> 08:42.939
I know you're both really worried
about your auditions, so…

08:47.401 --> 08:50.029
-"Oh, Susanna"?
-What the… What is this?

08:50.112 --> 08:52.532
Songs. For your auditions.

08:52.615 --> 08:56.035
Oh, I don't need this.
I already know what I'm gonna do.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.161
You picked a song?

08:57.245 --> 09:00.706
My audition is gonna be awesome.
Trust me, I'm gonna nail it.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.542
-Oh!

09:03.960 --> 09:05.670
Michela, sit down, please.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.296
Everyone, settle.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.507
Okay, class,

09:10.925 --> 09:12.927
I need everyone's attention
up here, please.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.179
Ms. B,
I want to hear more about the battle.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.266
Well, you're in luck, Esperanza,

09:18.349 --> 09:21.143
because today's lesson is all about that.

09:27.358 --> 09:30.820
So I have a stomach ache,
I just call you? Text you?

09:30.903 --> 09:32.905
You hop on the app
and request an appointment.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.949
We video chat if we need to,

09:35.449 --> 09:39.704
you get quick, affordable healthcare,
and I get to wear yoga pants.

09:39.787 --> 09:43.666
Girl, where is the coffee and cream, and…?

09:43.749 --> 09:46.544
Sweet'N Low? Girl, why are you
buying this fake-ass sugar?

09:47.336 --> 09:50.214
Nothing in here
is where it's supposed to be.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.633
I didn't organize my kitchen
the way you would?

09:52.717 --> 09:55.803
I'm saying there's a certain logic
to the way things should be set up.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.346
Haven't you read Marie Kondo?

09:57.972 --> 10:01.267
I have a video conference call
in a few minutes, I have no place to sit.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.020
Ooh, Cherry Garcia.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.690
-Yes, girl. Thank you, God.
-I should have gone to med school.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.901
Oh, honey, there's still time.
Mom and Dad would love that.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.696
You getting in right when I'm getting out.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.905
You're still a doctor.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.907
Maybe not for long.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.786
My old life, it was killing me, Nic.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.415
I wasn't happy
long before it all fell apart.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.544
Sometimes I can't even remember
why I wanted to be a doctor.

10:29.545 --> 10:32.298
But of course,
Mom and Dad wanted me to do it, so…

10:32.381 --> 10:34.634
-You were always the good daughter.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.349
There's this Ghanaian word, "sankofa."
It means go back and get it.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.977
I know what <i>sankofa </i>means.
I listen to The Roots.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.940
While I was away,
I decided to go back and find

10:50.024 --> 10:51.776
whatever it was that I left behind.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.819
Figure out what I was missing,

10:53.903 --> 10:56.197
so I could finally live the life
that I was meant to.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.324
Maybe you should try it.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.285
What am I missing?

11:01.994 --> 11:02.828
I don't know.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.165
Maybe Kevin? Mmm.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.875
You mean Tevin?

11:07.958 --> 11:10.753
Well, if it's worth correcting the name,
it's worth getting them digits.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.672
I wanna see you having fun again.

11:14.548 --> 11:17.635
Ooh, you're gonna see him today
when you drop off Dion, right?

11:18.803 --> 11:22.515
You gotta wear my lucky dress.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.350
-Seriously?
-Oh, yes, seriously, honey.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.851
This is a proven commodity.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.604
You know how many bracelets
I racked up wearing this dress?

11:28.688 --> 11:29.522
Hm.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.233
It's beautiful.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.567
Just like you.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.653
Put that hair back,
let him see your pretty face.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.780
Hit him with that razzle-dazzle.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.909
-Maybe.
-No, no. Not maybe. You're wearing it.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.994
You're definitely wearing it.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.425
 <i>I'm starving.</i>
 <i>I gotta go.</i>

11:57.508 --> 12:01.178
<i>Pizza looks like brains today.</i>
-<i>Brayden. Pssh, what a creep.</i>

12:01.262 --> 12:04.056
-<i>That kid smells funny.</i>
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

12:04.140 --> 12:06.308
-<i>He looks scary.</i>
-Hey.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.270
-You're Brayden, right?
-Yeah.

12:10.020 --> 12:14.358
I'm Esperanza, that's Jonathan,
and that's Dion.

12:15.025 --> 12:18.028
I remember being the new kid.
It was super hard to make friends.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.280
Besides me.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.490
Dion and I were best friends
the first day.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.785
-So we thought we'd help you out.
-Can you sing?

12:25.745 --> 12:26.620
Why?

12:26.704 --> 12:29.373
There's a musical revue coming up,
and we're all gonna be in it.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.668
They're still trying
to figure out their auditions.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.379
You can audition with us
if you want.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.132
I don't know. I'm still trying
to figure out where everything is.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.842
<i>Get him.</i>

12:40.384 --> 12:43.095
<i>Get him alone.</i>

12:43.637 --> 12:45.556
Maybe you could show me around the school?

12:45.639 --> 12:46.515
Sure.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.102
-Now?
-No, we were gonna plan our auditions.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.355
It's better if he shows me around.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.195
Actually, yeah, it's probably better
if Dion shows you around.

13:00.446 --> 13:04.325
We're still gonna do
that thing after school, right?

13:04.408 --> 13:08.412
I got you. Come on.
I know everything about this place.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.956
<i>Attention, students.</i>

13:11.040 --> 13:13.834
<i>Until further notice,</i>
<i>no one is allowed near the sinkhole.</i>

13:15.377 --> 13:18.798
Over there's Mr. Fry's classroom.
He's a really good science teacher.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.218
So why are you just starting school now?

13:23.135 --> 13:24.512
I just got to Atlanta.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.640
-Well, where did you come from?
-Alabama.

13:27.723 --> 13:31.143
-Lived there a long time?
-My whole life, until three months ago.

13:31.936 --> 13:32.937
Why'd you come here?

13:34.438 --> 13:35.356
To find you.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.530
Science lab's down this hall.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.580
-Oh, yeah. And one--
-What are you doing?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.791
<i>He's mine.</i>

14:02.258 --> 14:03.509
No!

14:07.555 --> 14:08.514
What was that?

14:09.265 --> 14:11.308
-What just happened?!
-I-I-I don't know.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.440
Wanna see the gym?

14:19.900 --> 14:21.360
-Yeah.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.635
<i>Locating Dion.</i>

14:48.262 --> 14:49.847
Hi.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.267
Mrs. Warren, hi.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.436
Hey, sweetie, have you seen Di?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.771
He and Jonathan are working
on some extra credit work.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.316
After school, like, as in now.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.737
-And you look amazing.
-Well, thank you.

15:05.905 --> 15:10.284
-I wish he'd told me he was gonna be late.
-But this gives us a chance to catch up.

15:10.367 --> 15:13.454
-So, what you been up to, girl?

15:24.131 --> 15:26.759
How are we gonna get down there
to see what's inside?

15:28.344 --> 15:29.720
Hey, excuse me.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.389
You're not supposed to be here.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.307
Uh…

15:34.516 --> 15:39.855
-What are you doing here all by yourself?
-W-would you believe science stuff?

15:42.483 --> 15:43.317
What?

15:43.817 --> 15:44.777
Huh?

15:46.445 --> 15:47.446
Hmm.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.209
-Whoa!

16:17.935 --> 16:21.397
I tried to eat
an entire bunch of bananas, you see? Um…

16:22.064 --> 16:24.942
Anyway, th-thanks for listening.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.277
Good luck with the, with the science.

16:38.455 --> 16:42.710
So, have you been helping Dion
with his audition?

16:42.793 --> 16:45.170
I think he's a little lost.

16:45.754 --> 16:48.632
He'll get there, I'll make sure.
What about you? What song are you doing?

16:48.716 --> 16:50.843
I think I'm gonna do "Beautiful Dreamer."

16:50.926 --> 16:55.389
It was the last song Stephen Foster wrote
before he died in 1862.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.808
And instead of it being up here, like…

17:00.644 --> 17:02.062
It's down here like…

17:04.440 --> 17:06.358
And I can do that way better.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.193
Okay.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.114
I gotta go. Bye.

17:14.158 --> 17:14.992
Sorry I'm late.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.328
Dion, you cannot
use your powers in public.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.373
It's not public.
It's our private car that you own.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.418
Lease. And that's besides the point.
Someone could see you.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.337
The only people that saw me
were you and Esperanza,

17:27.421 --> 17:29.423
and you guys already know I have powers.

17:30.007 --> 17:31.091
We have rules.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.803
Well, I think one of the rules
should be that I get to be the judge

17:34.887 --> 17:36.346
of when I use my own powers.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.099
I think you're forgetting the rules
of how to speak to your mother.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.018
I'm sorry.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.732
Why are you dressed up?
Are you going somewhere?

17:47.775 --> 17:50.277
I, uh… I had a meeting.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.821
Put your seat belt on and let's go.

18:13.592 --> 18:14.426
Hey.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.762
What's up, little man?

18:17.346 --> 18:19.556
-Go get changed so we can get started.
-Okay.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.353
That kid is something else.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.688
They told me he was powerful,
but I had no idea.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.273
-Are you worried?
-Not at all.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.151
Honestly, I can't wait
to get in here and work with him.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.153
His imagination is incredible.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.989
He created a whole power
in front of me last time.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.325
-He could do that?
-Yeah. Y-- Yeah.

18:38.408 --> 18:39.952
I saw it with my own eyes.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.413
So I'm gonna incorporate that
into our training curriculum.

18:44.581 --> 18:47.501
It's kind of nice to hear someone
talk about it in a positive way

18:47.584 --> 18:48.919
and not something to be scared of.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.003
I'm not scared.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.133
I would love to know what that feels like.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.760
Maybe it's something
we should talk about, you and me.

18:57.886 --> 19:01.849
We're gonna be in this together,
so maybe we could find time.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.350
Maybe over--

19:03.433 --> 19:05.269
Don't say coffee.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.937
-Lunch?

19:08.188 --> 19:09.898
Is this you being subtle?

19:10.566 --> 19:12.484
-It's kind of weak, isn't it?
-What?

19:12.568 --> 19:15.654
If you want to ask me out,
you should just ask me out.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.364
-Okay, it's like that.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.324
All right, fine.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.744
You look amazing.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.331
And I'm not assuming it's because of me,

19:27.124 --> 19:29.293
although I kind of hope it is.

19:32.087 --> 19:32.921
Okay.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.506
Cool. Then,

19:35.757 --> 19:36.592
dinner?

19:37.634 --> 19:38.760
I'm ready.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.143
-What are you wearing?
-My superhero costume.

19:46.226 --> 19:49.771
I'm Mind Mover.
I move things with my mind.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.815
That's very literal.

19:52.858 --> 19:56.737
Okay, yeah, um, we just gotta
work on the costume a little bit.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.573
-I think he looks cute.
-No, it's fine. It's functional.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.241
Right? Like the Curry 4s.

20:01.325 --> 20:04.870
But we also want to find something with
a little bit of style like the Kyrie 5s.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.916
Neither of you is a sneakerhead?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.376
Okay, got it. Seriously?

20:11.460 --> 20:12.377
Uh-uh.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.925
-Still waiting on that answer.
-You'll find out after class.

20:21.261 --> 20:25.015
Now one more time. Great job. Yes.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.726
Remember,
it's all about the focus.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.728
-Whoa!

20:29.811 --> 20:31.855
-Janelle!
-<i>Code red, DR2.</i>

20:31.939 --> 20:33.982
-Are you okay?
-<i>Code red, DR2.</i>

20:34.066 --> 20:36.777
-What happened?
-I just walked up and the glass shattered.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.862
-Sorry.
-Why is this happening?

20:38.946 --> 20:40.155
She's having a bad day.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.659
Okay, just take a step back.
We will handle this.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.327
I don't understand what you're doing.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.663
You were supposed
to help her stop all this.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.456
Why are we here if you're not helping her?

20:49.539 --> 20:51.500
-There are setbacks.
-You okay?

20:51.583 --> 20:52.626
It's a process.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.379
Alonso, everything's fine,
just take care of her.

20:55.462 --> 20:58.257
-I'm fine.
-Hey, I'm Nicole, my son trains here.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.008
Simone.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.594
I've never seen
another mother here before.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.471
What's your daughter's power?

21:04.554 --> 21:05.806
She

21:06.890 --> 21:08.016
destroys things.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.310
I don't know how else to say it.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.063
One minute, there's a book on the table,

21:13.146 --> 21:15.732
and the next moment it's just dust.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.110
Yeah. It sounds like a lot.

21:18.193 --> 21:21.029
Yeah, well, these BIONA folks
said they could help,

21:21.113 --> 21:24.908
but we've been here a week
and she's still destroying things.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.660
I know what that feels like.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.454
I still have a scar on my shoulder
from when my seven-year-old

21:29.538 --> 21:31.915
created a toy-nado out of Legos.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.500
Seven.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.089
How did you handle
a seven-year-old with superpowers?

21:39.172 --> 21:41.091
Eh, I'm not sure that I did.

21:41.925 --> 21:42.884
Yeah.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.722
I know this place can seem weird,
but the people here, they do good work.

21:46.805 --> 21:51.351
And I'm on the advisory board,
so if you ever need anything,

21:51.435 --> 21:53.812
even just to talk, hit me up.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.149
Nicole?

21:59.359 --> 22:01.653
-It's gonna be okay, I promise.
-Thank you.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.071
What's up?

22:03.905 --> 22:05.240
I need to show you something.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.380
Why are you showing me a video of Pat?

22:21.631 --> 22:23.258
It's a live feed.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.095
That's not possible.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.181
He arrived last night.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.559
We locked him away
and we are taking every precaution

22:32.642 --> 22:34.603
until we can verify he is not a threat.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.442
-I want to see him.
-No.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.568
Where is he at, L5?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.363
Hey, this is a bad idea.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.698
Noted. Now, take me to him.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.630
Nicole, I…

23:03.507 --> 23:08.053
I-I didn't know
that you were here, or coming to visit me.

23:08.887 --> 23:09.763
Um…

23:10.680 --> 23:11.515
Hi.

23:13.350 --> 23:18.814
I-I want you to know, I am so sorry
for everything that-- that happened.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.942
You-- You were totally right to, uh,

23:22.776 --> 23:25.028
stab me with that lightning rod. Um…

23:25.112 --> 23:28.990
And I want you to know that I'm…
I'm not that guy anymore.

23:29.699 --> 23:33.286
I-I-I can't really explain it,
but it's like

23:34.871 --> 23:37.749
all of the things that messed me up
b-before I got powers,

23:37.833 --> 23:42.379
the-the, uh, jealousy, and the…
Whatever, all that stuff is gone.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.133
And once I realized
I wasn't sick anymore, I…

23:47.759 --> 23:50.137
I-- I'm so sorry for,

23:51.221 --> 23:52.639
for what I did to you,

23:54.015 --> 23:56.393
and to Dion.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.313
H-- How is he?

24:01.022 --> 24:01.857
No.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.236
No, you don't get to… miss him.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.031
You don't get to think about him
and talk about him.

24:10.657 --> 24:11.908
Sure, I understand.

24:11.992 --> 24:15.871
No, you don't understand.
I'm not your friend, Pat.

24:15.954 --> 24:18.874
I'm here to look at the room
where they keep you,

24:18.957 --> 24:22.461
so that I can make certain
that you are never getting out.

24:25.297 --> 24:29.634
Well, I mean, I-- I'll get out eventually.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.386
Once they confirm I'm not a threat,

24:31.470 --> 24:33.555
they're gonna let me out
so that I can help.

24:34.055 --> 24:34.890
With what?

24:38.018 --> 24:41.771
I saw the Crooked Man on the news.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.191
I-- I know it's-- it's weird,

24:44.274 --> 24:50.071
but somebody else has that dark energy
and is-- is doing bad things,

24:50.155 --> 24:52.324
and I wanna… I-I wanna help stop them.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.454
<i>You're</i> the Crooked Man, Pat.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.250
You're the one
with the darkness inside of you.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.878
You're the one that wanted to be Mark,

25:05.921 --> 25:08.840
right up until the moment
where you killed him.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.053
With or without powers,

25:13.929 --> 25:16.264
that is never going to change.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.238
-You cannot let him out of that cell.
-I won't.

25:31.321 --> 25:34.699
And Dion will never,
ever know that he's here?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.243
-He won't.
-Promise me.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.370
Nicole, I promise.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.290
I don't understand.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.126
Neither do we,
but we are running the tests now--

25:45.210 --> 25:47.337
No.
No, th-that's not what I mean.

25:48.713 --> 25:53.343
Of all the people that we lost,
why is <i>he </i>the one that gets to come back?

26:02.727 --> 26:05.355
I've never known anyone
who had more than one power,

26:06.064 --> 26:08.233
much less someone
who can make up their own.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.361
The new ones happen
when I really want something.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.573
-Also when I'm trying to help somebody.
-Yeah? How does that work?

26:15.073 --> 26:19.202
Well, once, when my mom was sad, I made
a light show to make her feel better.

26:20.662 --> 26:21.496
A light show?

26:21.580 --> 26:23.957
You know, twinkle lights
floating in the air.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.334
Can you show me that right now?

26:26.418 --> 26:28.920
I don't do that anymore. It's babyish.

26:30.964 --> 26:33.967
Making someone feel better,
particularly your mom,

26:34.759 --> 26:36.678
is the most grown-up thing you can do.

26:40.849 --> 26:44.185
-Hey, we were just taking a break.
-Dion, grab your things. We need to go.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.563
-But I wasn't finished talking to--
-Dion, now!

26:47.063 --> 26:49.733
Is, uh, everything okay?
I thought we were gonna talk.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.610
I'm sorry, I just…

26:53.987 --> 26:54.946
We just have to go.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.908
-My lesson wasn't done!
-Dion, please stop talking.

27:00.243 --> 27:03.705
Why are we leaving?
I wasn't finished talking to Tevin.

27:03.788 --> 27:06.958
I have to leave,
and when I need to leave, you need to go.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.044
-But why?
-Because I said so.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.756
But when do <i>I </i>get to say so?
I'm not a little kid anymore.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.342
One of these days,
you can do whatever you want

27:15.425 --> 27:18.887
and you won't have to listen to me, okay?
But today is not that day. Now, let's go.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.156
You should have stayed dead.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.701
It would've been easier for everyone,
especially Nicole.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.873
Or did you come back because you thought
you could repair things with her?

27:48.541 --> 27:50.502
Well, I never stopped caring about her.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.629
Even when you tried to kill her?

27:57.008 --> 27:58.593
But I didn't come back for her.

28:01.262 --> 28:03.431
Did you find the Crooked Man video yet?

28:03.515 --> 28:06.059
Still not letting that one go.

28:08.645 --> 28:10.605
Something bad is coming, Suzanne.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.859
Whether you like it or not,
you're gonna need my help.

28:22.992 --> 28:24.369
Do you have any more homework?

28:25.704 --> 28:26.538
Hey.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.332
Come here.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.711
Can we talk about today?

28:34.462 --> 28:36.673
-Why'd you do that?
-I was upset.

28:36.756 --> 28:37.882
About what?

28:40.218 --> 28:43.346
-Do you ever think about the Crooked Man?
-You mean Pat?

28:47.350 --> 28:48.476
You do? When?

28:49.102 --> 28:51.688
I used to have bad dreams
about Thanos or Voldemort,

28:51.771 --> 28:54.816
but now if I have a bad dream,
it's the Crooked Man.

28:55.692 --> 28:56.860
Does that happen a lot?

29:01.197 --> 29:04.200
-Why didn't you say anything?
-Because, you know…

29:05.326 --> 29:06.411
You're scared.

29:06.494 --> 29:07.829
<i>I'm</i> scared?

29:07.912 --> 29:09.706
That's why
you started boxing, right?

29:09.789 --> 29:13.418
But you don't have to worry.
If anything happens, I'll protect you.

29:16.546 --> 29:17.756
Oh, sweetie.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.718
Everything's gonna be okay.

29:22.927 --> 29:23.762
All right?

29:24.345 --> 29:26.556
I'm sorry I said anything, okay?

29:27.348 --> 29:28.349
Get ready for bed.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.461
What was that about?

30:01.382 --> 30:02.592
Pat's alive.

30:02.675 --> 30:04.677
What the hell? What are you talking about?

30:04.761 --> 30:05.887
Lower your voice.

30:07.680 --> 30:11.309
He's in a cell at BIONA,
and it's a long story,

30:11.392 --> 30:13.853
but Dion can't know about it.

30:13.937 --> 30:17.357
-So you're just gonna lie to him?
-Did you hear him?

30:17.440 --> 30:20.276
I'm trying to keep him
from having any more nightmares.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.529
He's a smart kid, Nic.
You can talk to him.

30:23.029 --> 30:25.281
He thinks he's supposed to be
taking care of <i>me.</i>

30:25.782 --> 30:26.783
That's messed up.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.661
I need to be more protective of him.

30:29.744 --> 30:32.038
Honey, I don't think
you <i>can </i>be more protective.

30:35.041 --> 30:38.253
Pat's in a cell,
and he's never getting out,

30:38.336 --> 30:40.296
and Dion will never know about it.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.552
I'm gonna put him to bed.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.829
-Hey.
-Hi.

31:13.413 --> 31:16.291
I heard there was a problem
with Dion Warren's mother

31:16.374 --> 31:18.084
and our new guest, Pat Rollins.

31:19.002 --> 31:19.961
They have history.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.463
I read the file.

31:25.091 --> 31:28.303
This is Pat Rollins
in his Crooked Man form two years ago.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.930
He said someone else
is the Crooked Man now,

31:31.014 --> 31:32.432
and it's on its way here.

31:33.391 --> 31:37.228
It took some searching,
but I found a news clip he mentioned.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.065
The two creatures look different,
but somehow

31:41.816 --> 31:44.027
they're both forms
of Pat's Crooked Man energy.

31:44.110 --> 31:47.864
Okay, but you said it yourself,
the Crooked Man <i>is </i>Pat.

31:47.947 --> 31:50.825
-It's his DNA.
-I know it doesn't make sense.

31:51.326 --> 31:55.371
But somehow, someone else
has all that power, and for some reason,

31:56.581 --> 31:58.458
they just brought it back to Atlanta.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.025
Why did you do that?

32:26.110 --> 32:29.405
Why did you try and attack him
if you couldn't do it?

32:30.114 --> 32:32.158
<i>He was so close.</i>

32:33.534 --> 32:35.745
I thought you were getting stronger.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.959
<i>You're making me stronger</i>
<i>every day.</i>

32:41.751 --> 32:44.837
<i>Our army is growing.</i>

32:45.964 --> 32:49.133
Why do you need an army to fight Dion?

32:50.551 --> 32:52.387
<i>He defeated me once,</i>

32:53.513 --> 32:56.933
<i>sent me into exile in pieces.</i>

32:58.685 --> 33:01.437
<i>But you will help me destroy him.</i>

33:02.981 --> 33:06.067
-Then what happens?
<i>Solidarity.</i>

33:06.150 --> 33:09.404
And then, you'll keep me
with you and I won't be alone?

33:09.487 --> 33:11.280
<i>Yes.</i>

33:12.573 --> 33:14.534
What can I do?

33:17.704 --> 33:19.580
<i>Take him down</i>

33:20.832 --> 33:23.334
<i>from the inside.</i>

33:37.557 --> 33:38.474
<i>Dion.</i>

33:39.058 --> 33:42.061
What the heck are you doing here?
Did you break into my room?

33:44.939 --> 33:48.109
Uh, that wasn't what it looked like.
I was startled, that's all.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.028
<i>I'm not in your room.</i>

33:50.611 --> 33:52.071
I'm staring right at you.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.114
<i>I'm in your head.</i>

33:53.740 --> 33:54.657
What do you mean?

33:55.158 --> 33:56.826
-What?

33:59.662 --> 34:00.788
<i>I'm in your head.</i>

34:02.248 --> 34:03.750
How are you doing this?

34:03.833 --> 34:05.334
<i>I have a secret, Dion.</i>

34:06.544 --> 34:07.545
<i>I have powers.</i>

34:09.130 --> 34:09.964
<i>Just like you.</i>

34:13.176 --> 34:15.386
<i>I think we're going to be best friends.</i>
