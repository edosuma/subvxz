00:13.200 --> 00:18.320
I'd like you to appear on television and
appeal to members of Islamic communities.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.313
Your cabinet feels
you're making a tragic mistake.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.994
The man has murdered countless innocents

00:25.080 --> 00:29.278
and you are putting your hopes
for this country's safety on him.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.351
They will come after you.
I assure you of that.

00:32.439 --> 00:35.398
We're talking about removing the president.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.233
We are in a national crisis
and he is in over his head.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.080
He's brought this on himself.
I need his itinerary,

00:42.160 --> 00:46.199
specifically in regards
to Assad's televised address.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.953
- Why?
- The less you know, the better.

00:49.040 --> 00:52.953
Because of me, Fayed has a device that
can arm all the suitcase nukes he wants.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.598
(Chloe) Don't blame yourself.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.831
When the next bomb goes off
and thousands of more people die,

00:57.920 --> 01:00.593
everybody will remember
I made it possible.

01:00.680 --> 01:05.355
CTU found me. I needed to preoccupy them
with a bomb to enable my escape.

01:05.440 --> 01:09.069
The delivery system software
was programmed for five detonations

01:09.160 --> 01:11.116
at five high-priority targets.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.192
Because of your carelessness,
we are now down to three.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.475
More than enough for our needs, Gredenko.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.152
Our country lost the Cold War

01:18.240 --> 01:22.074
because it was afraid to use these weapons
against the Americans.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.073
Today we will correct that mistake.
And the Arabs will take all the blame.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.558
Marilyn, it is vital that we find Gredenko.

01:29.640 --> 01:34.395
If we retrace the route you took that night,
do you think you'd recognise the house?

01:34.480 --> 01:35.071
Maybe.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.308
What's goin' on with you and Jack?

01:38.400 --> 01:40.709
He's looking for someone.
He thinks I can help.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.473
You mean Gredenko?
What do you know about him?

01:43.560 --> 01:46.870
I followed Graem to a house one night.
He met with some Russians.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.509
Jack wants to take me over there
to see if it can jog my memory.

01:50.600 --> 01:55.071
You won't take Jack where Graem met
the Russians but to a different address.

01:55.160 --> 01:58.914
Now, you do this for me,
and I promise you you will see Josh again.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.116
If you don't, he dies.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.629
Marilyn, is any of this familiar?

02:04.720 --> 02:07.632
Yes. That's it - the blue house on the right.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.038
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

02:09.560 --> 02:10.753
Go, go!

02:11.360 --> 02:13.237
Bomb! Everyone out!

02:17.680 --> 02:20.717
Come on, come on. Move.
Go, go. Don't stop!

02:46.600 --> 02:48.318
- (phone rings)
- Buchanan.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.038
- It's Jack.
- What do you got?

02:50.120 --> 02:54.193
We've been ambushed. The house that
Marilyn led us to was wired with explosives.

02:54.280 --> 02:59.400
Half my team is down.
Send paramedics to 9407 Hindry Place.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.516
- They knew we were coming.
- Gredenko?

03:01.600 --> 03:07.197
I think so. I'm trying to find Milo and Marilyn.
I think they're being pursued by hostiles.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.875
I'll have a team there.
I'll monitor local bandwidth.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.349
Bill, hurry. We need to find them.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.476
This way. This way, come on.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.674
- Marilyn?
- I can't...

03:22.760 --> 03:25.672
- We gotta keep moving. Move, move.
- I can't.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.071
Come on.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.116
Come on, this way.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.672
(man) Over there. The other way.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.795
- (phone ringing)
- (woman on TV)... within miles of ground zero.

04:05.880 --> 04:10.396
Survivors are being treated at local hospitals
and at makeshift medical facilities.

04:10.480 --> 04:16.156
Local authorities continue to urge people
to stay in their homes until further notice...

04:18.720 --> 04:22.315
- Yeah.
- We took out the CTU team.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.676
- So is my son dead?
- Yes, sir.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.919
Right, well.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.197
Had to be done.
Do you have Marilyn?

04:35.280 --> 04:37.555
- No, sir, not yet.
- Why not yet?

04:37.640 --> 04:40.200
She escaped with someone.
We're tracking them now.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.269
Dammit.

04:41.360 --> 04:46.115
We'll find her soon, sir. The man she's with
doesn't look like a trained field agent.

04:46.200 --> 04:50.637
Make sure you take her alive. I need her
to find Gredenko so I can end this mess.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.518
I understand.
I'll call you as soon as I have her.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.112
(thud)

05:03.920 --> 05:05.512
Ed.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.916
They know we're here.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.309
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

05:17.560 --> 05:20.472
Marilyn, listen to me.
I'm gonna cover you.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.676
When I do, head back towards the alley.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.435
Run as fast and as far away from here
as you can. You understand me?

05:26.520 --> 05:28.317
- Yeah.
- OK.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.990
Targets are right behind us,
behind those dumpsters.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.799
Remember, we need to take that woman alive.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.995
Just wait. Wait till I tell you.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.831
Go!

05:47.280 --> 05:49.350
(screeching)

05:54.320 --> 05:55.878
Let's go, let's go.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.349
- I told you to go!
- I couldn't! Oh!

06:03.160 --> 06:05.628
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait!

06:07.760 --> 06:09.159
Kill him.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.269
Drop your weapon!

06:18.360 --> 06:20.999
- Let her go!
- Drop your weapon or I'll kill her.

06:21.080 --> 06:26.074
If you wanted to kill her, she'd be dead
by now. Drop your weapon or I will use mine.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.196
Do it!

06:32.760 --> 06:38.676
On your knees! Hands on your head, interlace
your fingers. Turn around and face the fence.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.880
Milo, let me see it.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.393
(moaning)

06:47.480 --> 06:51.439
There's no arterial bleeding.
You'll be OK. CTU will be here in a minute.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.273
Take this gun, make sure he doesn't move.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.028
That call you took was from Gredenko. You
tipped him off. Over half my team is dead!

07:03.120 --> 07:06.874
- You don't understand!
- What, that Gredenko knew we were coming?

07:06.960 --> 07:09.997
It wasn't Gredenko on the phone.
Those aren't his men.

07:10.080 --> 07:14.392
If they weren't Gredenko's men,
whose were they? Who sent them?!

07:14.480 --> 07:16.630
Your father.

07:18.360 --> 07:22.114
- What are you talking about?
- It's true, Jack, I swear.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.760
Your father called me in the car.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.148
My father?

07:28.240 --> 07:32.392
He told me to lead you to that house.
He said if I didn't, he'd...

07:33.520 --> 07:35.909
He said that he killed Graem

07:36.000 --> 07:39.151
and that if he had to, he would kill Josh.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.231
I'm sorry.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.234
He has my son!

07:53.160 --> 07:55.879
Marilyn.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.669
Do you have the address
to Gredenko's safe house?

07:59.760 --> 08:01.193
Yes.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.434
- I need you to give it to me now.
- I can't. Not till I have my son.

08:06.520 --> 08:10.479
I will help you get Josh back,
but I need that address now.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.348
Gredenko is our only chance
of recovering the nuclear weapons.

08:14.440 --> 08:19.468
You saw what happened in Valencia
earlier today? This is going to be worse.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.632
Please, just give me the address.

08:24.680 --> 08:28.036
I recognised the house as we were driving.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.669
It's on Glasgow - 9421.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.313
Don't move.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.477
- (phone rings)
- Buchanan.

08:39.559 --> 08:43.951
I've got the correct address
for Gredenko's safe house - 9421 Glasgow.

08:44.039 --> 08:46.429
Turner's team will be there. Run point.

08:46.520 --> 08:49.318
I want you to send me
a smaller team to my location.

08:49.400 --> 08:53.359
I'm at an industrial park on Pine,
just south of Oxford.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.398
Have the team bring me a vehicle
with a full tactical kit.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.711
They have to transfer Milo to CTU.
He's shot. It's not critical.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.634
Divert the rest of the team to the address
on Glasgow to initiate attack.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.950
Get back to me when you've got Gredenko.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.554
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later.

09:08.640 --> 09:13.111
- That's not good enough.
- Bill, please. Just trust me.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.474
This is personal.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.073
Jack!

09:19.240 --> 09:21.117
How could I have been so stupid?

09:40.200 --> 09:42.270
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.397
- Did you finish the vectors?
- No.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.035
If you're having trouble,
I can help you.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.872
I'm just not finished.

09:50.960 --> 09:57.229
And I don't want this to turn into another
conversation about whether or not I'm OK.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.311
I'm sorry, love.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.836
If you can't talk to me,
talk to a staff psychologist or your sponsor.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.309
I don't need them. I'll be fine.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.791
We just heard from Jack. Marilyn Bauer
is safe. She gave us Gredenko's location.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.872
- Milo was shot but he's gonna be OK.
- What happened?

10:12.960 --> 10:17.670
He held off three armed hostiles till
Jack got there. He's up for a commendation.

10:17.760 --> 10:20.832
Debrief him when Medical gives you the OK.

10:20.920 --> 10:24.071
I will. Thanks for rubbing
that salt in the wounds.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.549
- What?
- The nukes are armed cos I'm a coward.

10:26.640 --> 10:30.872
And now you want me to listen to Milo
talk about what a bloody hero he is.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.757
Coincidence?

10:32.840 --> 10:36.719
- It'll be taken care of. Thanks.
- Taken care of.

10:37.600 --> 10:42.594
We're coordinating the Gredenko operation.
TAC teams are moving in on his location.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.671
I'll be right there.

10:46.560 --> 10:50.030
I pushed you to work too soon.
Someone from District will relieve you.

10:50.120 --> 10:55.513
They'll just make me feel worse. I need a few
minutes. I'll be fine. I'm gonna take a walk.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.639
- I'll cover for you. Be back before we launch.
- Yeah, I will.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.474
Give me the phone.
We need to make the call.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.949
"Scramble caller" has to be enabled.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.476
- Give us a second.
- Does he know where Phillip has Josh?

11:31.560 --> 11:35.633
- No. I'll have to force my father's hand.
- Meaning what?

11:35.720 --> 11:38.871
He'll call my father
and tell him he's apprehended you,

11:38.960 --> 11:43.192
but you won't give him Gredenko's location
until he takes you to see your son.

11:43.280 --> 11:44.554
What if Phillip refuses?

11:44.640 --> 11:48.838
You have to stay firm. Say it's not
a negotiation, no matter what he threatens.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.832
Jack, you're asking me
to put Josh's life at risk.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.956
Josh's life is at risk.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.476
My father won't give away his location
unless he thinks he has to.

11:57.560 --> 12:01.269
Is that what this is about, finding Phillip?
Josh is secondary?

12:01.360 --> 12:04.079
My father will have Josh with him.

12:05.040 --> 12:09.272
Marilyn, I will do everything in my power
to make sure your son is safe.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.916
How do you know he won't betray us?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.354
He wants to live.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.991
Let's go.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.995
(man on TV) As biohazard and hazmat units
make their way to the hot zone...

12:38.080 --> 12:39.832
You don't want to watch this.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.354
You know, Josh.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.590
Your father was very proud of you.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.117
He'd tell me how blessed he felt

12:53.200 --> 12:59.594
knowing everything he was working so hard
to build would be left in such good hands.

12:59.680 --> 13:04.356
- Do we have to talk about this now, Grandpa?
- No, of course not.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.509
He loved you very much.

13:10.960 --> 13:16.910
Remember, I'll be able to hear both sides
of this conversation. You're set, dial.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.956
(phone rings)

13:24.720 --> 13:27.029
- Do you have her?
- Yeah.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.554
But we took casualties.
I'm on my own now.

13:29.640 --> 13:33.599
- You're getting a team to take out Gredenko?
- Yeah, I am.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.672
She won't say where Gredenko is
until she sees her son.

13:41.720 --> 13:42.311
Put her on.

13:46.680 --> 13:50.116
- I did what you asked. Now, where's Josh?
- Marilyn, look.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.112
I know you're frightened.
This doesn't have to end badly.

13:53.200 --> 13:58.115
If you help me find Gredenko,
we can all survive this as a family.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.988
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just want my son!

14:02.080 --> 14:07.552
I'm just saying, you made your deal
with Graem, now make a deal with me.

14:07.640 --> 14:12.839
With enough time, you and I and Josh
can rebuild whatever is left of this family.

14:13.800 --> 14:19.557
After all, the legacy I'm trying to preserve
will someday be his. We can do this.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.791
But first you have to tell me
where Gredenko is.

14:23.920 --> 14:27.595
Only after this man takes me to see my son.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.797
That will only complicate things.
I need Gredenko now.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.271
Tell me where he is.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.276
No.

14:37.000 --> 14:43.075
You may have misunderstood my offer as
a sign of weakness, so let me make it clear.

14:43.160 --> 14:47.950
If you do not help me,
I see no future for you or Josh.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.591
I will walk into the next room
and I will kill him.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.274
Right now.

14:55.760 --> 14:59.799
Tell me... or Josh dies.

14:59.880 --> 15:05.273
I will not tell you
what you want to know until I have my son!

15:06.520 --> 15:08.033
Give him back the phone.

15:13.080 --> 15:13.796
Yeah.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.429
Bring her here to me
at the Grandmont Hotel, room 2132.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.475
We're on our way.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.869
We got the address. You did great.

15:25.560 --> 15:28.358
Cuff him, put him in the back.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.118
- Josh?
- Uh...

15:39.200 --> 15:42.033
I'll go downstairs to get a soda.
You want anything?

15:42.120 --> 15:45.635
- No, thanks. Did you look in the mini bar?
- Uh...

15:45.720 --> 15:47.950
There wasn't anything that I wanted.

15:48.040 --> 15:51.077
Why don't you call room service?

15:51.160 --> 15:53.116
Well, I just feel like getting out.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.032
Josh. Don't even think about it.

16:08.400 --> 16:13.315
No one's life is worth the destruction
of everything I've built.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.713
Now, step away from the door.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.791
I was beginning to worry.

16:37.880 --> 16:42.158
The meeting went long.
Here is the president's itinerary.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.118
Oh, good. This will work.

16:45.200 --> 16:48.636
- So when does all this happen?
- Now.

16:48.720 --> 16:53.919
Authorise clearance for someone to get inside
the bunker. Once he's in, he'll carry the ball.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.390
Carry the ball?
You mean kill the president.

16:57.480 --> 17:00.153
I like to think we're beyond
doubting ourselves.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.959
This president has endangered
the lives of millions.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.156
You do not need to tell me
what the stakes are here.

17:08.480 --> 17:12.632
- So who are we putting inside?
- A security specialist, private sector.

17:12.720 --> 17:16.315
I requested that he advise my group
on several response options.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.630
He has level-two clearance. Upgrade him.

17:18.720 --> 17:23.919
- They will trace this thing right back to me.
- No, you won't even be investigated.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.355
We have a cover.

17:26.440 --> 17:29.432
- A cover? Who?
- Assad.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.353
You're trying to make it look like he did this?

17:32.440 --> 17:36.592
Just call in your authorisation code.
That's all the information you need.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.875
(phone rings)

17:38.960 --> 17:42.077
- Yeah, Dan?
- The president's asked to see you.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.914
OK, tell the president
I will be with him in a moment.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.275
Sir, our man will be here within the hour.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.593
Call me when you're done with the president.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.829
Oh, Tom, come in.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.674
- You asked to see me?
- I'd like to hear your thoughts on something.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.957
- My thoughts? On what, sir?
- Assad's speech.

18:16.040 --> 18:21.068
He's going live in less than an hour. Before
I give him my thoughts, I wanted yours.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.672
Is there a problem?

18:24.760 --> 18:27.115
- No, sir. It's just...
- What?

18:28.080 --> 18:31.152
I assumed you were no longer
interested in my opinions.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.674
Tom, I still value yourjudgment.

18:33.760 --> 18:37.230
And if I've made you
feel otherwise, I apologise.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.959
All right, sir.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.593
How much longer?

18:57.680 --> 19:02.196
I'm not sure. I have to recalculate
the profile for two of the target cities.

19:02.280 --> 19:05.875
Hurry. I don't want to be exposed like this
any longer than necessary.

19:05.960 --> 19:09.475
You think the authorities know
we're working with Fayed?

19:09.560 --> 19:11.630
If they don't, they will soon.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.795
I was in my kitchen when I saw the flash.

19:17.880 --> 19:22.670
I turned to look out my window
and it just exploded.

19:22.760 --> 19:26.673
All the windows.
There was glass everywhere.

19:26.760 --> 19:30.958
And then there was this sound.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.871
It was so loud.

19:32.960 --> 19:38.080
- Oh, man. Hell of a day, huh?
- Yeah, you could say that.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.071
- Can I get you anything else?
- No.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.315
Yeah.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.312
Whiskey, pint, single malt.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.631
- What kind?
- That kind.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.711
- This?
- Yeah.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.277
- And these.
- OK.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.392
- Wait, your change?
- Keep it.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.438
- I'm on my way.
- From where?

20:52.520 --> 20:54.556
I told you, I went out for a walk.

20:54.640 --> 20:58.599
The TAC team is about to move in
on Gredenko. I need you at your station.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.797
- I'm on my way.
- Morris...

21:20.000 --> 21:21.797
Come with me.

21:31.560 --> 21:36.236
I want you to put this on under your clothes.
It's just a precaution.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.873
- My hands are shaking.
- Here.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.873
I'm gonna do everything I can
to get him back.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.997
He's the only reason I stayed with Graem.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.878
He's the only good thing I have left since.

22:21.800 --> 22:22.596
You ready?

22:22.680 --> 22:24.511
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.038
Get out.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.993
You do exactly what I tell you,
you understand me?

22:39.160 --> 22:41.993
Let's go.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.473
(woman) Agent Pressman,

22:59.560 --> 23:05.157
I just want to make sure you understand that
you need to not exert too much pressure...

23:12.280 --> 23:14.271
- Hey, Milo.
- Hey.

23:14.360 --> 23:18.558
- How are you holding up?
- They say I'm gonna be OK.

23:22.760 --> 23:25.274
It's... So, what happened?

23:25.360 --> 23:29.638
I was stupid.
They don't pay me to be a field agent.

23:29.720 --> 23:33.918
Maybe they should. You protected
Marilyn Bauer. That's what I heard.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.514
I had no idea what I was doing.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.068
The thing just happened so fast.

23:39.160 --> 23:44.154
You don't have to downplay it to make me
feel better. You don't have to do that.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.231
- OK.
- Yeah.

23:48.320 --> 23:51.153
Hey. You OK?

23:51.240 --> 23:53.549
Yeah.

23:53.640 --> 23:57.349
- Well done.
- Thanks.

24:01.280 --> 24:06.195
We'll push Assad to make these changes.
Your suggestions are all excellent, Tom.

24:06.280 --> 24:10.273
- Just doing my job.
- I'd like you to be there when he delivers this.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.909
I will be. Excuse me,
I have a briefing with Senator Benson.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.228
Of course, Tom.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.398
Melinda, I have notes
that need to be taken to Assad.

24:24.480 --> 24:27.472
Yes, Mr President. I'll be right in.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.675
- What did he want?
- He asked me to review Assad's speech.

24:38.760 --> 24:43.072
He'll never get the chance to deliver it.
You need to authorise that clearance.

24:43.160 --> 24:47.392
- Our man will be here any minute.
- It's in the works. It's just taking a while.

24:47.480 --> 24:50.438
- We need it before he's here.
- I will call Security again.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.592
I'll call if there's a problem.
Go meet with him.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.671
All right.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.349
(man) Operations.

25:00.440 --> 25:03.671
I need to speak to the ranking
Secret Service agent on site.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.671
- Yes.
- (man #2) Agent Hollister.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.354
This is Tom Lennox.
I need to see you immediately.

25:08.440 --> 25:13.070
I can meet you as soon as I get someone
to man my position in about 15 minutes.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.277
I've got something to show you.
Where are you right now?

25:16.360 --> 25:19.397
- B wing, room 17.
- I'm on my way.

25:23.560 --> 25:27.519
Carson wondered if you were playing us.
He didn't want to bring you into this.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.309
But I said that we could trust you.
I told him that you understood!

25:31.400 --> 25:36.394
- Nothing justifies killing the president.
- This president is giving us no choice.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.040
- Don't do this.
- It's already done.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.589
- (man) Operations.
- This is Reed Pollock.

25:58.680 --> 26:01.478
I have a message
for Agent Hollister from Mr Lennox.

26:01.560 --> 26:06.111
Tell him the issue has been resolved and
that Mr Lennox won't need to meet with him.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.589
- I'll tell him.
- OK, thanks.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.630
We confirmed the intel. The Glasgow house
is owned by a Russian shell corporation

26:20.720 --> 26:22.995
that Gredenko has an interest in.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.913
- Is Turner's team in place?
- They'll say when they're ready.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.356
Chloe, lock the satellite
and establish a comm link.

26:29.440 --> 26:30.395
Nadia.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.796
- I told you not to take too long.
- Sorry.

26:37.560 --> 26:43.032
- The backup module needs to be reset.
- Do it. The operation starts in two minutes.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.111
Come with me.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.478
Do you realise what a betrayal this is?

27:00.680 --> 27:03.353
I was a little late.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.637
Morris, I can smell it on your breath.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.790
Yes, I took a drink.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.110
But I spat it out straight away.

27:11.200 --> 27:15.113
- Please.
- I swear. Chloe, look at me. Look at me.

27:16.280 --> 27:19.192
I am stone-cold sober.

27:19.280 --> 27:23.398
You're losing control.
You're placing other people's lives in danger.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.989
I'm gonna have to tell Buchanan.

27:31.080 --> 27:34.629
After everything that has happened.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.553
Something had to give.

27:37.640 --> 27:42.509
The important thing is that I realised
I didn't want to throw everything away.

27:42.600 --> 27:45.751
Especially you, especially you.

27:48.520 --> 27:54.231
And I stopped myself
and that is a little victory. Right?

27:55.240 --> 27:57.913
I swear it will never happen again.

27:58.720 --> 28:04.238
Don't tell Buchanan because you're right.
Me getting back to work is the best medicine.

28:06.240 --> 28:09.471
- I'll be watching you for the rest of the shift.
- Fine.

28:09.560 --> 28:12.552
- Call your sponsor.
- I will.

28:22.520 --> 28:27.799
- Terrorist team is taking final positions.
- Chloe, open the video link.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.791
Hal, what's your status?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.108
No sign of a lookout.

28:31.200 --> 28:34.875
- Windows are covered but we're good to go.
- Commence at your discretion.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.155
- Ryan, is your team ready?
- Yes, sir.

28:37.240 --> 28:41.518
OK, we're going in on three, two, one.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.638
Cover, cover.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.995
- (man #1) Clear.
- (man #2) Clear.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.599
- (man #3) Clear!
- (man #4) Clear.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.237
- (man #5) Clear.
- (man #6) Clear.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.390
First sweep all clear, sir.

29:14.480 --> 29:16.152
Roger that.

29:16.240 --> 29:20.392
Mr Buchanan,
there's no sign of Gredenko or anyone.

29:21.040 --> 29:24.157
Hal, when you complete the sweep,
process for evidence.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.195
Yes, sir.

29:25.280 --> 29:29.068
Chloe, text Jack's cellphone
and tell him we don't have Gredenko.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.071
Open it.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.754
Hold up here.

29:48.440 --> 29:51.512
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.356
Don't think about warning my father.

29:54.440 --> 29:58.877
Once he sees you brought me here, he's more
likely to shoot you than I am. Understand?

29:58.960 --> 30:03.829
Both of you go up to the door. You knock.
When he lets you in, I'll follow. Let's go.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.634
Marilyn, get back.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.359
Open the door. Now, go.

30:34.040 --> 30:37.077
- Where the hell is my father?
- I don't know. I swear.

30:37.160 --> 30:41.039
- Where's Josh?
- Marilyn, just stay calm.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.599
Put these on.

30:42.680 --> 30:44.830
(phone rings)

30:44.920 --> 30:47.388
Answer. Put it on speaker.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.517
- Hello?
- (Phillip) Hello, Marilyn.

30:51.600 --> 30:55.354
Jack, even when you were young
I learned not to underestimate you.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.512
I didn't want to hurt Josh.
You forced my hand.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.558
Take a look out the window,
the adjacent roof.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.957
Oh, Phillip, please don't!

31:11.480 --> 31:16.998
Dad, you only have one play left here - that's
to try and cut a deal with the government.

31:17.080 --> 31:21.232
Explain your connection to the nuke
and that you'll help in exchange for immunity.

31:21.320 --> 31:26.314
That is your only option. You pull that trigger
and that option is gone. Understand?

31:26.400 --> 31:31.076
I'm no fool, Jack. They're never gonna
give me immunity after everything I've done.

31:31.160 --> 31:33.469
You don't know that for sure!

31:33.560 --> 31:38.509
Right now, they are desperate. But either way,
for you, this is over. Dad, it's over!

31:38.600 --> 31:41.672
There is no empire to protect,
there's no legacy left.

31:41.760 --> 31:45.150
There is Marilyn, Josh and me. That's it.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.877
Please, Dad.

31:49.960 --> 31:53.270
I know you don't want to hurt Josh.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.396
I'm the one you want.

31:55.480 --> 31:59.393
You let Josh go, I will surrender.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.357
Come alone, unarmed, and I'll let Josh go.

32:07.280 --> 32:11.319
But if you bring anyone else into this,
I will kill him.

32:11.400 --> 32:13.391
I understand.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.674
Hang up the phone.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.315
- (man) Field Ops.
- This is Jack Bauer.

32:30.400 --> 32:36.157
Send a team to the Grandmont Hotel to pick
up a hostile. He's secured. He's in room 2132.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.229
Right away.

32:37.320 --> 32:39.311
Jack.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.518
This is our only chance.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.831
Hey, I need to talk to you.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.831
- About what?
- Morris.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.717
- Not here.
- He came and saw me in the infirmary...

33:09.800 --> 33:12.917
- I know he's been a little shaky.
- Has he been drinking?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.594
- You smelled it on his breath?
- Yeah.

33:15.680 --> 33:18.592
I did too. We talked.
He didn't metabolise the alcohol.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.069
"He didn't metabolise the alcohol"?

33:21.160 --> 33:24.118
It sounds weird, but it's true.
He spit it out.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.509
- How do you know?
- Cos he told me.

33:26.600 --> 33:30.275
- And you believe him?
- We were married. If he was drunk, I'd know.

33:30.360 --> 33:33.238
He's not drunk.
He's been sober for three years.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.678
- I didn't know he was an alcoholic.
- Now you know.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.033
- You don't think Buchanan should know?
- No.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.430
If he slips up again,
I will personally tell Buchanan.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.592
Let's just leave it for now.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.989
OK.

33:55.720 --> 33:58.473
OK, I want you to wait here for Josh.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.279
Do you think your father will keep his word?

34:01.360 --> 34:03.635
If I keep mine.
You know how to use this?

34:03.720 --> 34:05.836
- No.
- Point, hit, shoot.

34:05.920 --> 34:09.036
Do you want me to call CTU
and tell them to send help?

34:09.120 --> 34:11.998
No. I need to take care of this myself.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.594
Jack... thank you.

34:20.159 --> 34:23.708
Everything is gonna be all right.
Just wait here.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.389
I'm unarmed!

35:05.240 --> 35:08.198
Dad?

35:09.720 --> 35:11.073
I'm unarmed.

35:12.880 --> 35:17.032
- Come out. I am unarmed!
- (Phillip) That's close enough.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.551
Turn around.

35:31.480 --> 35:35.109
Now show me that you're not
wearing an ankle holster.

35:46.960 --> 35:50.350
Take one step toward me
for every step Josh takes away.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.553
Josh.

35:55.440 --> 35:56.509
Slowly.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.596
Your mother is waiting
in the stairwell. Go! Go!

36:19.240 --> 36:20.468
That's it.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.756
Oh, Josh! Oh, God!

36:25.400 --> 36:28.198
Are you OK? Are you OK? Let's go. Go!

36:40.200 --> 36:44.557
I never meant for this to happen, Jack.
I didn't have a choice.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.711
I don't know how, but Gredenko found out
about my role in Palmer's assassination.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.952
So he blackmailed me.
Forced me to cooperate.

36:57.000 --> 37:02.393
So Gredenko had you divert the bombs your
company was responsible for destroying?

37:02.480 --> 37:04.675
He's a radical nationalist.

37:04.760 --> 37:07.479
Told me that he wanted to preserve arsenal

37:07.560 --> 37:12.350
for the day when the Soviet Union
would be re-established.

37:12.920 --> 37:15.480
I believed him because I had to.

37:15.560 --> 37:20.714
- When did you know he sold them to Fayed?
- When the bomb was detonated in Valencia.

37:20.800 --> 37:24.031
- That's the truth?
- Absolutely.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.429
I've been looking for Gredenko ever since

37:28.520 --> 37:31.910
so that I could find out
what he knew about Fayed and stop this.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.879
I'm a patriot, Jack. I never wanted
any harm to come to this country.

37:35.960 --> 37:39.316
You wanna lie to yourself, you go ahead.
But stop lying to me!

37:40.200 --> 37:44.512
You let all of this happen
just so you could cover up what you did.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.108
You have all the smarts
that Graem never had.

37:50.200 --> 37:53.795
You'd have handled Gredenko
before this all got out of control.

37:53.880 --> 38:00.069
You know, none of this would have happened
if you hadn't turned your back on me.

38:00.160 --> 38:05.473
So that you could become what?
A civil servant?

38:07.440 --> 38:12.389
So your people will use Gredenko
to find this terrorist.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.519
- The truth will come out about all I've done.
- We never got Gredenko.

38:18.520 --> 38:21.353
Then all of this was for nothing.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.273
On your knees.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.278
It didn't have to end like this, Jack.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.032
You could have had it all.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.756
I want you to know...

38:43.080 --> 38:46.436
I never wanted you to feel
like I had turned my back on you.

38:48.080 --> 38:51.277
That I had turned my back on the family.

38:52.360 --> 38:55.272
I just had to go my own way.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.595
Do things for myself. I...

39:04.200 --> 39:06.873
I was never good enough for you.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.671
I'm sorry.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.471
Anyway...

39:17.640 --> 39:19.631
I'm ready.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.914
What are you waiting for?

39:26.000 --> 39:28.958
Do it! Damn you.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.271
(rings)

40:09.120 --> 40:09.791
Yes.

40:09.880 --> 40:12.440
My name is Jack Bauer.
Who am I talking to?

40:12.520 --> 40:15.512
You must have exhausted
your options to find Gredenko.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.635
Who is this?

40:19.360 --> 40:20.873
It's Charles Logan, Jack.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.357
I might be able to help you but we need
to talk face-to-face. Where are you?

40:26.440 --> 40:29.876
- I'm near the airport.
- Good. You're local.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.633
CTU knows where I am.

40:32.720 --> 40:37.396
Come and see me, Jack.
As soon as possible.

40:37.480 --> 40:40.756
And come alone.
I'm looking forward to it.
