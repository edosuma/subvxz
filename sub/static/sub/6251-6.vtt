00:03.254 --> 00:06.212
I had a feeling
that my Melo/onfha melo/onfha
might hatch this morning,

00:06.340 --> 00:09.832
so I came in at the crack of dawn,
and there they were—
Iined up at the door.

00:09.969 --> 00:12.460
What, your
Melo/om‘ha me/o/onfha ?
No.

00:12.555 --> 00:14.546
The Woodchucks.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.052
- [ Whispering, Gasping ]
- They appear to be little girls.

00:17.143 --> 00:19.759
Yeah. Woodchucks are like
Girl Scouts, only scientific...

00:19.854 --> 00:21.435
and administered
by the Jeffersonian.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.433
They brought in
the dead body.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.810
A bunch of little girls
brought a dead body here?

00:25.902 --> 00:27.813
Woodchucks are
very industrious marmots.

00:27.904 --> 00:30.941
Okay, now, this is
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

00:32.617 --> 00:35.154
[ Device Beeps ]
Why are they applauding?

00:35.244 --> 00:36.905
Apparently, you’re
their role model.

00:36.996 --> 00:39.487
What I wanna know is why
they aren’t all freaked out...

00:39.582 --> 00:41.618
and getting trauma counseling.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.166
Because they’re the type
of children who idolize
Dr. Brennan.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.744
So, they were eco-camping
on the banks of the Savage River.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.376
These remains
are completely saturated

00:49.467 --> 00:53.460
[ Hodgins ] The girls fished
the body out of the river
and brought it to us.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.714
[Brennan ]
H0 W?

00:54.805 --> 00:58.047
- [Girl ] In our Woodchuck bus.
- Very impressive.

00:58.142 --> 01:01.726
I disagree.
Those Woodchucks disturbed
a federal crime scene.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.973
The area should have been
secured, samples taken.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.805
Yeah, they did a// that.

01:05.900 --> 01:09.484
Uh, water samples from the river
where the body was found.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.312
D/g/ta/ photographs
of the entire area.

01:12.406 --> 01:17.196
Plants, insects, soil samples
tagged with G.P.S. coordinates.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.902
Now, / know my soil samples,
and let me tell you something.

01:19.997 --> 01:23.080
These ladies— they are pros.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.078
Perhaps you should
throw them a bone.

01:25.169 --> 01:28.627
Not literally. Metaphorically.
After all, they were
very professional.

01:32.802 --> 01:35.384
[ Clears Throat]
Attention, Woodchucks.

01:35.471 --> 01:38.508
You were thorough
and assiduous...

01:38.599 --> 01:40.681
in your treatment of the body
and the crime scene.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.018
But next time, please
lea I/e the evidence
Where you found it...

01:45.106 --> 01:47.597
and let the experienced
professionals do their job.

01:47.692 --> 01:50.104
- [ Woodchucks Boa/ng ]
- But we helped!

01:50.194 --> 01:51.650
- [ Girl Gasps ]
- You’re mean!

01:51.737 --> 01:53.989
[ Woodchucks Booing, Jeer/ng ]

01:54.073 --> 01:57.190
- Their moods are capricious.
- You couldn’t have just
let them have that one,

01:57.285 --> 01:59.571
- let it go by?
- Then they’d never learn.
[ Scoffs ]

02:05.001 --> 02:07.913
[ Groans ]
What causes a corpse
to smell like a fan‘?

02:08.004 --> 02:10.245
[ Saroyan ]
Uh, a number of things.

02:10.339 --> 02:13.923
A compromised intestinal tract,
methane,

02:14.010 --> 02:17.468
some mining processes,
oil and gas refining,

02:17.555 --> 02:19.466
volcanoes.

02:19.557 --> 02:22.469
Volcanoes? Awesome.
Which of those is it
this time?

02:22.560 --> 02:26.678
Probably sulfur. Tissue samples
indicate a high concentration
of hydrogen sulfide.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.024
X-rays indicate this is
a middle-aged male...

02:29.108 --> 02:31.941
between 770 and 790
centimeters tall.

02:32.028 --> 02:34.861
Skeleton is... pretty banged up.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.781
Well, bouncing around the Savage River
for two months will do that.

02:38.868 --> 02:42.110
All the distal phalanges are missing
from the inner phalangeal joints.

02:42.204 --> 02:45.446
He’s missing his fingers.
What does that tell you?

02:45.541 --> 02:47.406
Tells me it was the mob
snipping off fingerprints.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.412
That very well may be,
but What it tells me...

02:49.503 --> 02:53.087
is you’re going out to look for fingertips
in case the Woodchucks missed them.

02:53.174 --> 02:55.631
Body was found by woodchucks?

02:55.718 --> 02:57.379
Take Hodgins.
He’ll explain.

02:58.888 --> 03:01.755
Hydrogen sulfide?
Yeah, guy’s full of it.

03:01.891 --> 03:04.223
So he smells basically
like a fart?
[ Chuckles ]

03:04.310 --> 03:06.676
Had to be pretty strong
to cover up the rotting
corpse smell, right?

03:06.812 --> 03:11.351
Hey, maybe somebody
drenched him in sulfur
to deal with the dead body stench.

03:11.442 --> 03:14.149
Or somebody tried to put him
in suspended animation.
That involves sulfides.

03:14.236 --> 03:18.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you
referring to ultra-secret
military experiments...

03:18.157 --> 03:20.990
to prolong life
by inducing hibernation?

03:21.077 --> 03:24.661
Uh, it’s not ultra-secret.
The army is doing field trials.

03:24.747 --> 03:27.363
I got a cousin in Iraq.
It maybe saved his life.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.365
It’s not ultra-secret?
Look, man.

03:29.502 --> 03:32.164
The trouble with getting your
info from conspiracy nuts—
[ Car Alarm Chirps ]

03:32.296 --> 03:34.662
is they never know
when to turn it off.
Yeah, you wait and see.

03:34.757 --> 03:37.715
We’re gonna find
that our victim was tortured
a little too enthusiastically,

03:37.802 --> 03:39.793
and then the government
tried to bring him back to life.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.629
Proving my point there, Hodgins.
Totally proving my point.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.430
Hey, should we call the military
possibility in to Booth?

03:45.518 --> 03:49.261
Yeah. Ooh, just leave out
my torture theory.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.433
Oh, so, you got a face
of the victim?
Why are you here?

03:55.569 --> 03:59.733
l-l would have called.
Well, I thought Hodgins
might have something...

03:59.824 --> 04:02.156
on this whole
“suspended animation” thing.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.529
- Hey, you listened to Hodgins?
- Listened to Wendell.

04:04.662 --> 04:07.324
What is DARPA?
Uh, it’s a Department
of Defense agency.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.997
The Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.166
Hodgins says they’re into
some pretty weird stuff,

04:12.294 --> 04:16.458
like creating supersoldiers
who don’t need sleep
and can kill with their laser beam eyes.

04:16.549 --> 04:19.040
Right. Well, I don’t know about
the “laser beam eye” thing.

04:19.135 --> 04:23.094
But they did have
a master sergeant go missing
about a couple months ago.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.513
Was the sergeant involved with
the hydrogen sulfide trials?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.091
Well, they wouldn’t confirm.
But I’ll tell you what.
They sounded nervous.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.435
There’s no photograph in here.
DARPA doesn’t give out
any photos.

04:31.522 --> 04:34.264
You give me
the reconstruction, though,
I can show them that,

04:34.358 --> 04:36.770
and they can tell us
if we got their guy.

04:36.861 --> 04:38.852
So, what do you have?

04:39.905 --> 04:42.738
Okay. Before you freak out,

04:42.825 --> 04:46.909
you should know that
I double- and triple-checked
the measurements and indicators.

04:46.996 --> 04:48.702
Okay, look.
I don’t freak out.
Do I freak out?

04:48.789 --> 04:51.531
- Some-Sometimes.
- Can we just see
the image, please?

04:53.043 --> 04:54.954
[Laughs]

04:55.045 --> 04:57.252
Yeah, what’s that
supposed to be?

04:57.339 --> 04:59.751
- Half man, half chicken.
- Come on.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.423
I believe this to be
fairly accurate.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.842
Okay, so you want me to go ask
the Defense Department...

05:03.929 --> 05:07.717
if their experimental supersoldier
is half man, half chicken?

05:45.262 --> 05:47.674
[ Hodgins ] DARPA created
a chicken soldier?

05:47.765 --> 05:50.347
[Wendell] I do not see
the United States military
making a chicken soldier.

05:50.434 --> 05:51.844
An eagle, maybe.

05:51.936 --> 05:54.097
That’s why we couldn’t find
his so-called fingers.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.974
Because they were
transformed into talons.

05:56.065 --> 05:59.023
lmean, talons would be
much better weapons.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.522
Human remains In water
tend to lose all their fingers
and toes due to predation.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.446
But if I were going to combine
human and animal D.N.A....

06:05.533 --> 06:08.900
with an eye toward
creating a supersoldier,
I’d go with a flatworm.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.906
- Why?
- Self-regeneration, obviously.

06:11.997 --> 06:15.740
People. Let’s break this down
as though we aren’t
in a comic book.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.871
No water In the smuses
or lungs.

06:18.963 --> 06:20.669
- No pulmonary edema.
- [Hodgins ]
He didn’t drown.

06:20.756 --> 06:24.044
No, the sinus cavity
is abnormally large.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.716
His whole sinus cavity is scarred.
The septum’s almost gone.

06:26.804 --> 06:31.423
Evidence of multiple
constrictions of the arterioles
at Kiesselbach’s plexus.

06:31.517 --> 06:35.055
[ Wendell] Well, that is a lot
of scar tissue. What are we
talking here— plastic surgery?

06:35.145 --> 06:38.808
The scarring could explain
why he has a beaklike nose.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.517
Polyps and tumors
in the maX/l/ary and sphenoid
could ’I/e enlarged the cavity

06:42.611 --> 06:45.774
The closest th/ng l’ve ever seen
to that is a cocaine addict
who ran out of drugs. ..

06:45.864 --> 06:48.571
and started snorting things like
sugar and powdered detergent.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.695
Anyone have any explanation
for these red str/pes. ..

06:50.786 --> 06:53.402
extending from the soft palate
down the esophagus?

06:53.497 --> 06:56.330
- Lacerations?
- Mmm. May I?

07:00.546 --> 07:03.333
I don’t think
these are lacerations.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.178
is that an organism ?

07:11.265 --> 07:14.052
Syngamus trachea.
It’s a gapeworm.

07:14.143 --> 07:17.385
- Where’d it come from?
- I don’t think you’re
gonna like my answer.

07:17.479 --> 07:21.313
Uh, it’s a parasite
found in... chickens.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.686
Do not tell me we’re back
to superchicken-soldier again.

07:29.742 --> 07:34.236
- Wh ya chicken?
- Wendell thinks maybe he
was supposed to be an eagle.

07:34.330 --> 07:36.321
You should be getting it now.
If you make a supersoldier,

07:36.415 --> 07:38.371
you would think it would be, like,
a robot or something invisible.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.242
Now you’re just delving into
pure science fiction.
Unlike a flatworm.

07:41.337 --> 07:44.875
That’s not science fiction.
Or a half chicken. That’s not
considered science fiction.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.502
Yeah. Okay, so we agree that
it does look like a chicken.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.299
No, it’s not a joke.

07:49.386 --> 07:52.378
Just tell me if we have
your missing DARPA guy.

07:52.514 --> 07:57.224
Does your missing sergeant look
anything like an animal—
any kind of an animal?

07:58.270 --> 07:59.771
A bulldog.

is this about my husband?

l’m afraid so.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.019
I’m very sorry
for your loss.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.980
What happened to him?

10:13.071 --> 10:15.027
We’re still in the process
of figuring that out.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.115
You don’t seem too surprised.

10:18.202 --> 10:21.786
Nick was never the type to just
disappear. I knew right away
it was something terrible.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.825
Where ’0’ you ﬁnd him?

from here.

He never swam in that river.

and sinuses were deformed.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.424
He didn’t take the proper
precautions at work, did he?

10:36.512 --> 10:38.798
No. I told him,
but he didn’t care.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.754
[Whispering ]
Sorry. Precautions to keep
from turning into a chicken?

10:40.849 --> 10:42.589
It’s the hydrogen sulfide
we smell.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.891
Without a breathing apparatus,
high concentrations...

10:44.978 --> 10:47.811
over a period of time
would deform the sinuses.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.638
Nick worked here
since he was a teenager.

10:49.733 --> 10:53.521
He said he was a chicken farmer
and he’d take the consequences.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.978
How did my husband
end up in the river?

10:56.073 --> 10:58.439
We were hoping maybe you’d be
able to help us with that.

10:58.534 --> 11:00.991
When I filed the Missing Persons report,
I told the police everything.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.735
He just disappeared
We have reason to believe...

ls Clucksten a supplier?

21:47.140 --> 21:50.632
They’re one of them. No way of
telling where these particular
human nuggets came from.

21:50.727 --> 21:54.185
There ’s a lack
of bruising on the bone
at the incision point.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.685
Removed postmortem.
So not torture obviously.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.482
There are symmetrical
slice marks.

22:00.570 --> 22:03.812
Also, pinching in the center
of the bone and tissue.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.192
Removed with shears?

22:05.283 --> 22:07.365
You should do a DNA. test,
of course.

22:07.452 --> 22:12.788
But l’m conﬁdent
that all four body parts
came from Nick Rabin.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.589
Hey.

22:28.932 --> 22:31.844
Are you here because of
your argument with Dr. Brennan?

22:31.935 --> 22:35.644
No, I’m-I’m here for a donation.
She told you about our fight?

22:35.730 --> 22:40.224
Booth figured it out.
I was just sitting there.
Donation for what?

22:41.528 --> 22:45.112
It’s gonna cost $1,500
to save this piglet.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.772
How much you in for?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.108
Are those tears in your eyes?

22:50.203 --> 22:54.116
I’m just—
I can’t stop thinking
about this little piglet.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.118
Okay.

22:56.209 --> 23:01.329
I’m gonna suggest that perhaps
it’s time for you to abandon
celibacy a little early.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.083
What does that have
to do with anything?

23:03.174 --> 23:05.381
Well, you’re forming
inappropriately strong attachments...

23:05.468 --> 23:07.129
to photographs of baby animals.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.131
Your libido is being rerouted.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.596
You need to come back
to the world.
W-Wait a minute.

23:11.683 --> 23:13.719
Inappropriate, my ass.

23:13.810 --> 23:17.052
Can I ask you—
What is wrong
with everyone here?

23:17.146 --> 23:20.354
Uh, well, you had a falling out
with your best friend over a pig.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.352
Your perspective is skewed.

23:22.443 --> 23:26.777
It’s time to reconnect with humanity,
gain a little perspective.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.820
Okay.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.866
All right,
so, if / ha ve sex,

23:31.953 --> 23:34.490
will you donate
to save my pig?

23:35.707 --> 23:38.949
That’s not really the point
I was trying to—

23:40.169 --> 23:42.160
We’ll revisit the pig question.

23:43.214 --> 23:46.377
You can keep this.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.016
cut off his thumbs...

23:58.104 --> 24:00.390
and then dumped him over
the Savage River Dam?

24:00.481 --> 24:02.392

24:02.483 --> 24:05.395
Oh. Do you recognize this?
[ Clears Throat]

24:05.486 --> 24:07.477
It’s the video
those PECT people
put on the Internet.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.358
Right. It was taken
with your camera.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.778
You’re making that up.
You can’t possibly know that.
No, we can prove that.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.825
Let’s start this
all over again.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.528
Okay. Did you
take this footage?

24:18.833 --> 24:21.745
Yes, I took it.
Did you give it
to Josh Parsons?

24:21.836 --> 24:24.202
Yes. I wanted
Clucksten shut down.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.755
Why? I mean, your husband
is next in line to take over
the whole business.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.754
Because I was tired of getting
threatening phone calls.

24:30.845 --> 24:33.427
I was tired of being hated
in my own town.

24:33.514 --> 24:37.598
But most of all, Agent Booth,
I wanted my husband
to get his real face back.

24:37.685 --> 24:40.347
So I gave the footage
to the activists.

24:40.438 --> 24:45.273
How is it possible
that your husband’s thumbs
ended up on the menu?

24:45.360 --> 24:47.772
Easy. Toss them in
with the nuggets...

24:47.862 --> 24:50.649
just before they’re breaded,
fried and frozen for shipment.

24:50.740 --> 24:54.904
Suggesting that the killer was
working in Clucksten Farms.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.236
You realize Clucksten ’s—
is doomed after this ?

24:58.373 --> 25:01.240
Yeah.
So you got exactly
what you wanted.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.165
No, Agent Booth, I did not.

25:03.252 --> 25:06.460
What I wanted
was my husband back.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.754
I understand.

25:11.302 --> 25:15.420
Is there anyone else who benefits
from Clucksten Farms going under?

25:17.141 --> 25:20.258
Probably the anti-smell people,
the people who live downwind.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.560
I need a name.
That’s all.

25:22.647 --> 25:25.730

about two miles downwind
of Clucksten’s.

Hey. I got some more data
on the bone bruising.

25:41.499 --> 25:45.583
Hey. So, I need $1,500.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.911
I need about 40,000

your money for?

into bacon?
Yeah.

We understand
that you’re trying to get the state
to shut down Clucksten Farms?

27:10.296 --> 27:14.209
Sure, because nobody
will come in and make them
regulate the stench.

27:14.342 --> 27:18.051
They were here first.
Yeah, back when it was
a free-range chicken ranch.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.048
It’s a different beast now.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.637
Uh, you’ll excuse me.

I took this up as a way
of getting some fresh air,
as ironic as that sounds.

27:30.733 --> 27:33.099
Considering your malodorous habit,
would you say that your dispute...

27:33.194 --> 27:37.654
with Clucksten Farms is more
financially motivated
than health-related?

27:37.740 --> 27:39.901
Sure. You know how
a baker sells his wares?

27:39.992 --> 27:42.984
Yeah, people smell the bread
from the outside. They go in,
they spend the dough.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.411

to smell my cinnamon buns,

to put you out of business.

[Lighter Flick/ng ]
Yeah, me and anybody who
relies on a sense of smell,

27:56.008 --> 27:58.215

Will your thumb
fit in this hole?

27:58.302 --> 28:01.669
Whoa, whoa, wait. Don’t be
sticking that on my thumb.
It’s like a mini guillotine.

28:01.764 --> 28:04.346
Yeah. Look, you want
to be careful with that.
It’s sharp as razors.

28:04.433 --> 28:07.095
That’ll nip your thumb off
in a jiffy.

28:10.273 --> 28:14.767
What?
Some kind of federal crime
to own a cigar clipper?

28:22.493 --> 28:25.360
The human eye
can only perceive color...

28:25.454 --> 28:29.038
between wavelengths
of 400 and 750 nanometers.

28:29.125 --> 28:33.368
This full-spectrum light source
simulates both the visible
and UV. spectrum.

28:33.462 --> 28:34.998
Angela is brilliant.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.711
So, we run the image
through the spectroscope.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.258
And now we can detect
color differences...

28:41.345 --> 28:43.256
that are not visible
to the human eye.

28:43.347 --> 28:47.215

as postmortem bruises
likely caused by rocks...

28:47.310 --> 28:49.392
and debris from the victim
traveling do wnriver.

28:49.478 --> 28:52.060
Right Then we assigned
all postmortem bruising...

28:52.148 --> 28:54.309
with one distinct color,
and perimortem with another.

28:54.400 --> 28:59.235
Now, injuries sustained
before death will appear red,

28:59.322 --> 29:01.233

and hours of work.

and work together closely.

the perimortem bruising?

29:21.218 --> 29:22.754

29:22.845 --> 29:25.461
continuing here
along the frontal
and parietal bones.

29:25.556 --> 29:29.094
All of them...
have identical directionality.

29:29.185 --> 29:32.222
- What the hell would leave
marks like that?
- Some kind of machine.

29:32.313 --> 29:34.850
And why
do they stop there?

29:34.941 --> 29:38.775
Something stops the weapon
from striking down
to the skull in this area.

29:38.861 --> 29:43.195
The microscopic metal deposits
on the clipped thumb bone don’t
match the baker’s cigar cutter.

29:43.282 --> 29:47.366
But, fortunately, I’m extremely
thorough and tenacious.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.945
There’s evidence of streaming
nuclei in the bone cells.

to find.

- No.

was that before or after...

Nick was a groper.
Never heard the guy coming.
It got old real fast.

How much training does it take
to run the beak-clipping machine?
None.

31:16.542 --> 31:20.205
Just gotta be the kind of person
willing to cut the beaks
off of newborn chicks.

31:20.337 --> 31:22.623
Why?
Because your machine...

31:22.715 --> 31:25.457

Nick’s thumbs and big toes.

31:25.551 --> 31:31.171
Hey, if I was gonna out
something off of Nick Rabin,
it would not be his thumb.

31:31.265 --> 31:35.178
Okay. What people usually do
right now is they insist
that they didn’t kill anyone.

31:35.269 --> 31:38.306
Well, maybe I fantasized
about it so many times,
it’s like I actually did it.

31:38.397 --> 31:42.811

about Nick Rabin ’5 death
or the mutilation of his body?

if you could arrange it,
