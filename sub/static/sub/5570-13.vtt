WEBVTT

00:02.436 --> 00:04.672
What do you got?
Hey. Nothing good.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.140
Woman named
Annemarie O'Hare

00:06.174 --> 00:07.675
didn't show up for
a date tonight,

00:07.708 --> 00:09.410
so her boyfriend asked
the superintendent

00:09.443 --> 00:11.212
to check her apartment.

00:18.119 --> 00:21.689
BOYLE: Someone raped her,
stabbed her 40 times,

00:21.722 --> 00:23.157
and then strangled
her with her own...

00:23.191 --> 00:26.427
MAN:
This isn't very fun, is it?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.162
*

00:28.196 --> 00:30.431
CHILD: * He's got games
to make you smile *

00:30.464 --> 00:32.500
* He'll make you say "my gosh"
My gosh.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.502
* It's Cookies
and Cuddles Corner *

00:34.535 --> 00:36.770
* With Josh-o-saurus Josh. *

00:36.804 --> 00:38.639
Oh, hi, Brian.

00:38.672 --> 00:42.310
I haven't seen you
in quite a while.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.313
Yeah, that's because
your show hasn't been on TV

00:45.346 --> 00:47.581
in, what, like, 15 years?

00:47.615 --> 00:49.583
Cool subconscious.

00:49.617 --> 00:52.320
I've been having
fun down here

00:52.353 --> 00:55.589
for the past decade
and a half.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.158
Why are we in my
childhood bedroom?

00:57.191 --> 00:58.526
What's going on?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.528
Nasty stuff.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.595
Stabbing.

01:01.629 --> 01:02.863
Strangulation.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.333
Traumatic events.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.201
I'm here to help.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.670
But you can't just interrupt.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.405
If you're in my
subconscious,

01:11.439 --> 01:13.507
aren't you supposed to
stay subconscious?

01:13.541 --> 01:15.776
The FBI has to catch bad guys.

01:15.809 --> 01:20.514
And sometimes it's scary,
and we use scary words,

01:20.548 --> 01:23.284
but what else
are we supposed to do?

01:23.317 --> 01:26.620
Hmm, how about,
just for this one,

01:26.654 --> 01:29.623
every time someone

01:29.657 --> 01:31.759
is going to use
a scary word,

01:31.792 --> 01:35.363
we come up with a word
that's better?

01:35.396 --> 01:39.767
You mean, like, we say
something nice or super-fun?

01:39.800 --> 01:42.436
Sure. Like, if I still
had my show,

01:42.470 --> 01:45.773
I would tell the kids
to play along at home.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.641
Sound good?
(kids cheering)

01:47.675 --> 01:51.145
Then let's get back
to the action.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.180
(bell chimes)

01:57.751 --> 02:01.222
Someone played Cowboys
and Indians with her.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.457
Tickled her 40 times.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.727
And then cuddled her
with her own unicorn.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.397
Well, the soda pop
spatter indicates

02:09.430 --> 02:10.931
that she was still
playing air guitar

02:10.964 --> 02:14.668
before she was sent to an
awesome farm in the country.

02:14.702 --> 02:16.404
But she didn't
go down easy.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.241
Take a look at the ring finger
on her left hand.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.815
The ring finger's gone.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.817
That's the trademark
of the Marrying Man.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.786
We've got a serial hugger
on our hands.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.522
JOSH-O-SAURUS:
"The Marrying Man"?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.257
Really?

02:36.290 --> 02:39.360
Why do bad guys get
cool nicknames?

02:39.393 --> 02:41.529
Shouldn't they get
stupid nicknames?

02:41.562 --> 02:43.464
I don't know, it's just
what they call him.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.466
Well, you should give
him a nickname he hates.

02:45.499 --> 02:49.203
You should give all the bad
guys nicknames they hate.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.738
Rule number two.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.807
Whenever you give a
hugger a nickname,

02:53.841 --> 02:58.779
say the word "mister" followed
by a delicious ice cream flavor.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.882
Everybody got it?

03:04.885 --> 03:06.854
The ring finger's gone.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.856
That's the trademark
of Mr. Pralines and Cream.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.959
We have a serial hugger on our
hands, and he's in New York.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.995
We should call Naz,
this is an all-hands-on-deck.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.997
I don't think Naz is gonna
be running point on this.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.234
David Englander's been
chasing Mr. Pralines and Cream

03:20.268 --> 03:21.902
ever since he hugged
his first victim.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.471
Right, the profiler.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.772
BRIAN:
David Englander.

03:24.805 --> 03:28.909
Everyone acted like it was this
huge deal that he was coming.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.345
He caught a notorious hugger
named Mr. Butter Pecan

03:31.379 --> 03:34.415
last year, and now he's got
a book on the best seller list.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.683
Everyone at the CJC acted

03:35.716 --> 03:37.418
like he was some kind
of a rock star.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.452
He's here.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.923
Wow.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.935
Mr. Pralines and Cream.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.405
Now, I'll bet you think
you've seen everything.

03:57.438 --> 04:01.742
Got yourself assigned to
the shiny New York division,

04:01.775 --> 04:03.477
must make you feel good.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.279
Hell, I'll
bet you think

04:05.313 --> 04:06.547
the Pope ought
to stop his sermon

04:06.580 --> 04:08.282
whenever you burp up a thought.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.784
Well, I promise you,

04:10.818 --> 04:14.722
you have never seen anything
like Mr. Pralines and Cream.

04:14.755 --> 04:19.059
Oh, sure, he... he plays Cowboys
and Indians with his victims.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.529
He tickles his victims.

04:21.562 --> 04:25.032
He cuddles them...
with their own unicorn.

04:25.065 --> 04:29.437
By now you're thinking, "Well,
what's the big deal? Come on.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.805
I've seen women tickled,
I've seen them cuddled."

04:31.839 --> 04:34.942
Not like this,
you haven't.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.545
The women he hugs,

04:37.578 --> 04:40.948
cuts off their cool dinosaur
toys to take 'em home with him.

04:40.981 --> 04:45.519
You are about to stare into the
abyss, ladies and gentlemen.

04:45.553 --> 04:48.522
And you'll be damned lucky
if the only thing that it does

04:48.556 --> 04:49.757
is stare back at you.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.394
Is everyone ready?

04:55.696 --> 04:56.964
Sure.

04:56.997 --> 04:57.931
Good.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.404
Now, without exception,
every single one of the hugs

05:03.437 --> 05:06.407
took place inside the
home of the victim,

05:06.440 --> 05:08.442
with no sign of
forced entry.

05:08.476 --> 05:11.412
That means that
Mr. Pralines and Cream...

05:11.445 --> 05:14.482
has the ability
to freely gain access.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.749
I think he works
for a utility company

05:15.783 --> 05:18.452
or poses as someone who does.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.555
I have been looking
at a Mr. Patrick Lee Boyd

05:21.589 --> 05:23.724
for some time.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.426
Excuse me.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.562
You, uh, consultant?

05:28.596 --> 05:31.532
Why... are you toying
with your phone?

05:31.565 --> 05:34.402
Sorry, I'm just looking at the
case from a different angle.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.937
(chuckles)

05:36.970 --> 05:38.406
Well, let's all try to stay

05:38.439 --> 05:39.873
on the same page
for the moment, shall we?

05:39.907 --> 05:43.076
No problem, definitely want
to be a team player.

05:43.110 --> 05:46.079
It's just, I'm pretty sure
Mr. Pralines and Cream

05:46.113 --> 05:48.549
is one of two guys I found--

05:48.582 --> 05:50.083
Jason Braun or Ian Aston.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.819
(scoffs)

05:51.852 --> 05:55.088
And, what, you've had
the case file for... (laughs)

05:55.122 --> 05:56.757
for... for, what, an hour?

05:56.790 --> 05:57.825
40 minutes.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.027
But you don't have to work
for the power company

06:00.060 --> 06:01.695
to get easy access
to a building.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.698
You can also be really good
at picking locks.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.435
I may or may not
do it... often.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.771
The point is, I just checked
locksmiths in the other cities

06:10.804 --> 06:12.039
where the huggings happened,

06:12.072 --> 06:14.041
I've been texting back and forth
with the owners,

06:14.074 --> 06:15.142
and as it turns out,

06:15.175 --> 06:17.778
there are two locksmiths
who have lived in the cities

06:17.811 --> 06:20.047
where Mr. Pralines and Cream
has hugged women

06:20.080 --> 06:23.817
and now live in New York--
Jason Braun and Ian Aston.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.154
Seems worth checking
out, right?

06:29.189 --> 06:31.158
Jason Braun turned out
to be a cool guy.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.895
I even got his Xbox Live handle
so we could hang out online.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.164
Ian Aston slammed
the door in our face,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.633
which made sense once we
established a connection

06:39.667 --> 06:41.168
between him and a couple
of the victims.

06:41.201 --> 06:44.638
That led to a warrant to search
a storage locker he kept.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.940
And that is where we found...

06:48.942 --> 06:51.679
...his trophy stash.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.881
JOSH-O-SAURUS: Those aren't
finger bones, are they?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.549
Yeah.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.685
Look, the finger bones
are a no-go.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.219
When you talked
about 'em before,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.755
they were cool
dinosaur toys.

07:01.789 --> 07:02.956
So if you
show them,

07:02.990 --> 07:04.758
I want them to be...

07:04.792 --> 07:06.627
BRIAN: Cool dinosaur toys.
All right, Josh.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.095
It doesn't matter what
the trophies looked like;

07:08.128 --> 07:09.597
we got him.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.769
I have been chasing Mr. Pralines
and Cream for years.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.771
You caught him in a day.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.906
What's your story?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.641
Fresh eyes.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.477
No, I know talent when I see it,
and you're the real thing.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.912
Well, some of the time.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.647
Well, I want to work with you.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.181
Now, Behavioral Analysis

07:28.215 --> 07:30.484
is the top appointment
at the FBI, Brian.

07:30.518 --> 07:31.985
(chuckles)

07:32.019 --> 07:33.987
We're the profilers.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.088
The freaking rock stars.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.591
And we are tapping you
on the shoulder.

07:37.625 --> 07:38.992
Okay.

07:39.026 --> 07:42.262
So what do you say,
Mr. Brian Finch?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.997
Want to come visit Quantico,

07:44.031 --> 07:46.767
help me catch some of the worst
people on the planet?

07:49.202 --> 07:51.572
Would you please stop
shouting "road trip"?

07:51.605 --> 07:52.740
Come on, it's not like
I wouldn't be

07:52.773 --> 07:53.774
doing anything important.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.610
The Behavioral Analysis
Unit works on big cases.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.146
Mr. Fudge Brownie, Mr.
Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,

07:59.179 --> 08:00.614
Miss Mango Sorbet...

08:00.648 --> 08:01.882
Did you read that
off the Web site?
Maybe.

08:01.915 --> 08:06.053
Behavioral Analysis also works
tirelessly at self-promotion.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.288
David Englander
more than anyone.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.256
Yeah, he's weird.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.792
But he's also a master
at Bureau politics.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.527
If I don't at least give him
a crack at you,

08:13.561 --> 08:16.196
I'll never hear
the end of it, so...

08:17.631 --> 08:19.867
...you can go to Quantico
for a couple of days.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.701
Yes!
What?

08:20.734 --> 08:23.904
As long as you
do not discuss NZT.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.174
No one at Behavioral Analysis,
including Englander,

08:27.207 --> 08:28.742
has been read into those files.

08:28.776 --> 08:29.877
Mum's the word.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.211
You're gonna need your NZT
while you're in Virginia.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.814
Hmm.

08:33.847 --> 08:34.948
That has to be
properly supervised.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.053
I have a job here.
(scoffs)

08:40.087 --> 08:41.922
It's just a couple of days.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.658
(quietly):
Fine.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.926
Looks like we're going on a...

08:45.959 --> 08:46.827
Road trip.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.931
*

09:11.919 --> 09:15.355
* One, two, three,
four, five, six... *
Almost ready.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.357
There's no way you're
putting all this in my car.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.359
And there's no way
you're bringing a bong--

09:19.392 --> 09:21.729
or anything that you would
put in a bong-- in my car.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.363
Fine, I guess I can rough it
for a couple of days.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.933
One bag, one backpack.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.669
* With the radio on

09:28.702 --> 09:31.939
* I'm in love
with Massachusetts *

09:31.972 --> 09:35.042
* And the neon
when it's cold outside *

09:35.075 --> 09:38.011
* And the highway
when it's late at night *

09:38.045 --> 09:39.947
* Got the radio on...

09:39.980 --> 09:43.250
BRIAN: So, as it turns out, not
only is Rebecca a good partner,

09:43.283 --> 09:45.252
she also checks most
of the boxes you want

09:45.285 --> 09:47.387
in a road-trip buddy.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.889
She's down for Punch Buggy.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.824
Like, really down.
She can throw a jab.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.093
* You're a rich girl...
And she's more than willing

09:53.126 --> 09:56.897
to sing along when
her favorite song comes on.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.633
* You can rely
on the old man's money *

09:59.667 --> 10:02.102
* You can rely on the old
man's money *

10:02.135 --> 10:04.705
* It's a bitch, girl...
Whoa, this is
a sweet sound system.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.239
You know what would sound
awesome on this

10:06.273 --> 10:07.708
is Artificial Brain.
Please don't touch that

10:07.741 --> 10:09.009
with your dusty
orange fingers.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.844
It's voice-activated.
Really?

10:10.878 --> 10:11.845
That's awesome.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.647
Car, find
Artificial Brain.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.916
After this song.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.417
* Out of the rain.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.418
(heavy metal blares)

10:18.451 --> 10:19.820
We didn't hit our first hiccup

10:19.853 --> 10:20.988
until Virginia.
(music stops)

10:21.021 --> 10:23.791
But it was kind of a doozy.
Hey, that was a good song.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.793
Can I ask you something?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.327
Yeah.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.330
I've been thinking
about Senator Morra.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.733
The shooting.

10:32.766 --> 10:37.270
Brandy Jo Hawkins shot him
from over 3,300 yards away.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.139
If you believe her story.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.373
Oh, yeah?

10:40.407 --> 10:42.843
Not only does she make
an impossible shot,

10:42.876 --> 10:44.745
but she does it
while she's sick?

10:44.778 --> 10:48.248
Well, she was... on NZT, right?

10:48.281 --> 10:50.818
Yes, the shooter was on NZT,
which is weird enough,

10:50.851 --> 10:52.419
'cause there's not a
lot of it out there,

10:52.452 --> 10:55.155
but I was watching footage
of Morra from when it happened,

10:55.188 --> 10:59.793
and... I swear,
it's almost like he dodged.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.763
Like, before the gunshot.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.398
Like he saw it coming
from over 3,300 yards.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.036
Do you think he's on NZT?

11:09.069 --> 11:10.170
Bad.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.105
Very bad.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.173
Also dangerous.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.708
For me, for Rebecca--

11:14.742 --> 11:15.909
I have to nip this in the bud.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.011
Why? I mean...

11:18.045 --> 11:20.247
Why would a guy like that
need NZT?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.049
Well, he wasn't always
a guy like that.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.183
He was a broke,
struggling writer,

11:23.216 --> 11:25.085
and now he's running
for president.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.455
The pattern's
pretty familiar, right?

11:28.488 --> 11:30.023
Like the people
in my dad's group or...

11:30.057 --> 11:30.724
Me.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.926
It's all right-- you can say it.

11:35.262 --> 11:37.464
It does kind of feel
like a stretch, though.

11:38.832 --> 11:40.333
You know?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.035
And the thing is,
I'm the only one

11:42.069 --> 11:43.403
that's immune to
the side effects of NZT, right?

11:43.436 --> 11:44.404
You're the only one

11:44.437 --> 11:45.906
that we know about.

11:47.474 --> 11:49.409
Maybe Edward Morra's just, uh,

11:49.442 --> 11:51.711
your garden-variety
late bloomer.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.015
I'm just curious.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.216
Just curious?

11:56.249 --> 11:57.417
In my experience,

11:57.450 --> 12:00.020
when Rebecca Harris
is "just curious,"

12:00.053 --> 12:02.122
stuff gets figured out.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.958
Like Chinatown level stuff.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.299
Welcome to my house.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.967
This is where we catch

12:14.001 --> 12:15.969
the worst killers
and perverts there are.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.071
Uh-uh-uh!

12:20.540 --> 12:22.142
Welcome to my house.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.443
This is where we catch

12:23.476 --> 12:26.279
the worst huggers
and silly geese there are.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.981
Badass.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.282
Ready to meet the bad guys?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.122
They were out of office space,

12:35.155 --> 12:37.124
so they set us up
in something they call

12:37.157 --> 12:39.192
"The Evil Minds
Research Museum."

12:39.226 --> 12:41.394
It's where they keep
the journals and paintings

12:41.428 --> 12:43.330
and weird trophies
from these guys,

12:43.363 --> 12:45.565
but who wants to look
at that stuff?

12:45.598 --> 12:48.068
Wouldn't you rather see
some adorable kittens?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.137
And who doesn't like lollipops?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.105
Or balloon animals?

12:52.139 --> 12:53.841
Isn't that more fun?

12:56.309 --> 12:59.312
While Rebecca did what work
she could on our CJC case,

12:59.346 --> 13:03.116
I looked into a guy they called
Mr. Rainbow Sherbet.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.852
It didn't take me long
to figure out

13:04.885 --> 13:07.420
that he was probably a janitor
named Russell Lawlor.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.889
And that night,

13:08.922 --> 13:11.158
I ventured out
to grab a bite to eat

13:11.191 --> 13:12.525
near the hotel.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.566
Hi.
(groans)

13:19.599 --> 13:22.302
Sorry. If you're busy, I can
totally sit somewhere else.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.436
No, don't be ridiculous.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.044
Is something wrong?

13:31.078 --> 13:32.812
No.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.615
So, we got into a routine.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.616
During the day,

13:36.649 --> 13:38.551
I went through open case files.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.921
I checked out Mr. Mint Chip.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.223
He was a guy in Louisville
named Travis Seward.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.258
The guy they called
Mr. Rocky Road

13:45.292 --> 13:46.894
actually turned out to be a guy

13:46.927 --> 13:48.561
and his sick girlfriend
working together.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.031
Double scoop,
I guess you'd call it.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.333
At night,
I did everything I could

13:53.366 --> 13:56.036
to keep Rebecca from thinking
about Senator Morra and NZT.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.205
I pulled out my best material.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.107
How I got expelled
from middle school

14:00.140 --> 14:02.209
for smoking in the chem lab.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.476
How I almost got arrested

14:03.510 --> 14:05.212
for breaking
into the Central Park stables.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.247
I mean, it's not
a long-term solution,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.382
but it'll have to do until
I think of something better.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.383
A few days of that,

14:10.417 --> 14:13.386
and it was time to head
back to New York.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.293
(meowing)

14:20.327 --> 14:21.361
Ah.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.562
There sits our golden boy.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.997
(chuckles)

14:24.031 --> 14:25.032
I don't know about that.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.233
I just hope I was helpful.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.267
Helpful? (chuckles)

14:27.300 --> 14:28.635
You're a superstar, man.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.004
Game can recognize game,
right?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.239
Oh, hey, this is for you.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.141
I wanted to thank you.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.476
Oh, hey, signed and everything.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.378
This represents more
than just a parting gift, Brian.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.113
Hmm?

14:40.147 --> 14:41.281
See, I want you to read it,

14:41.314 --> 14:43.316
and I want you to consider
spending more time with us.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.152
We could make it worth
your while, Brian.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.286
The FBI

14:46.319 --> 14:49.422
is no place to build a nest egg,
you know what I mean?

14:50.423 --> 14:52.425
What do you mean?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.161
People just can't get enough
of this stuff, Brian.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.495
You know?

14:55.528 --> 14:58.398
The inner workings
of a depraved mind.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.399
Yeah.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.334
I got seven figures
for that.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.635
And I've already sold
the movie rights.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.337
Whew.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.006
You build a reputation here,

15:06.039 --> 15:07.374
hunting madmen,

15:07.407 --> 15:09.509
and you can do good

15:09.542 --> 15:12.445
and you can do well.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.516
Man, Englander's actually
kind of a douche, huh?

15:16.549 --> 15:17.617
One of a breed.

15:17.650 --> 15:18.551
Yeah.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.287
Something in his book
telling you that?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.055
Well, it's just sloppy.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.057
It's about Mr. Butter Pecan,

15:24.091 --> 15:25.592
the guy who hugged
all those high school kids.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.327
His real name is Andre Hannan.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.162
He was always a loner,

15:29.196 --> 15:31.999
got picked on a lot in school,

15:32.032 --> 15:33.300
so Englander figured out

15:33.333 --> 15:35.368
that he was targeting
the kinds of guys

15:35.402 --> 15:37.437
who made fun of him.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.539
So, captain of the football team

15:39.572 --> 15:41.141
and the prom king.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.313
Can we make a quick stop?

15:46.346 --> 15:48.148
Do you have to pee?

15:48.181 --> 15:49.382
I begged you not to drink
so much.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.450
No, I want to go to Bethlehem.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.985
Pennsylvania?
Yeah.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.520
That's where Andre Hannan is.
He's on death row.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.188
You want to go see him?
I do.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.656
But first,

15:56.689 --> 15:59.326
we got to find
a sporting goods store.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.228
I still don't understand
what we're doing here,

16:01.261 --> 16:03.630
or why we had to stop and buy
hand-grippers on the way.

16:03.663 --> 16:07.734
Well, Mr. Butter Pecan cuddles
his victims to death, right?

16:07.767 --> 16:10.437
Per my calculations, the hugger
would have had to exert

16:10.470 --> 16:13.073
no less than 300 pounds
of pressure on their necks.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.607
That's a lot of pressure.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.343
It didn't even come
up in the trial.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.212
Isn't that because Andre Hannan
confessed to all of them?

16:19.246 --> 16:22.182
Yes, but I looked up
a picture of him,

16:22.215 --> 16:24.051
and Andre Hannan
doesn't look like

16:24.084 --> 16:26.219
he could get anywhere
near 300 pounds.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.694
You guys are from the FBI?

16:34.727 --> 16:37.197
I was just wondering
if you could squeeze this for me

16:37.230 --> 16:39.132
as hard as you can.

16:51.344 --> 16:54.114
Mr. Hannan, I know you made it
all the way to death row,

16:54.147 --> 16:55.748
but I can tell you one thing.

16:55.782 --> 16:59.686
David Englander
got the wrong guy.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.289
You are not Mr. Butter Pecan.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.565
Andre Hannan confessed.
He went on 60 Minutes.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.467
He confessed again--
I watched it.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.770
Moreover,
his confession is consistent

17:17.804 --> 17:19.072
with the physical evidence.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.607
His confession was hazy.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.841
He said himself
that it felt like

17:21.874 --> 17:23.443
he was in some kind
of a fugue state.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.644
And the physical evidence
was extremely limited.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.346
There was no DNA match;

17:26.379 --> 17:27.614
there was no murder weapon
to be found.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.082
It was all circumstantial.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.184
What I'm offering you is a fact.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.153
There is absolutely no way
that Andre Hannan

17:33.186 --> 17:35.322
could exert
300 pounds of pressure

17:35.355 --> 17:36.656
with his bare hands.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.491
He just couldn't do it,
so that means

17:38.525 --> 17:40.160
you have an innocent man
sitting on death row.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.594
I let you go to Quantico

17:41.628 --> 17:43.363
to bank some good will
with David Englander,

17:43.396 --> 17:45.532
not to unravel his cases.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.633
So you choose politics
over the truth?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.335
Or justice?

17:48.368 --> 17:50.670
The American way?

17:50.703 --> 17:52.105
Give Hannan a polygraph.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.373
That's all I ask.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.275
EXAMINER:
Is your name Andre Hannan?

17:55.308 --> 17:57.277
(machine beeping steadily)

17:57.310 --> 17:58.311
Yes.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.680
Were you born
on April 17, 1978?

18:00.713 --> 18:02.549
Yes.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.817
Have you ever lied
to somebody who trusted you?

18:06.819 --> 18:08.688
Yes.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.723
Did you hug Jamie Anderson
in Cherry Hill, New Jersey,

18:10.757 --> 18:13.626
on September 13, 2012?

18:13.660 --> 18:15.128
Yes.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.829
How did you hug
Jamie Anderson?

18:16.863 --> 18:18.498
I gave him a juice box,

18:18.531 --> 18:20.267
and when he went night-night,

18:20.300 --> 18:21.701
I cuddled him.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.303
BOYLE:
So he passed?

18:23.336 --> 18:24.404
BRIAN:
With flying colors.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.873
"The most definitive pass
the examiner has ever seen."

18:26.906 --> 18:28.141
Direct quote.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.309
REBECCA:
Sorry, Brian.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.478
You were there. You saw him try
to squeeze those grippers.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.579
He couldn't do it.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.780
Maybe there's some
other explanation.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.348
Maybe he was stronger
back then.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.450
I mean, even he is
sure he did it.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.818
People have beat
polygraphs before.

18:38.851 --> 18:39.919
BOYLE:
Why would he lie?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.221
Why would he be trying

18:41.254 --> 18:42.222
to get on death row?

18:42.255 --> 18:43.823
And how could he lie so well?

18:43.856 --> 18:45.592
I don't know yet.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.460
Well, in the meantime,

18:47.494 --> 18:50.597
we have a lot of work
to do here at the CJC,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.665
where we're all
employed, so...

19:00.773 --> 19:02.475
BRIAN: She's still looking
into Senator Morra?

19:04.411 --> 19:06.613
I guess whatever I said
in Virginia wasn't good enough,

19:06.646 --> 19:08.781
which means
I need to do better.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.383
Fast.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.451
SANDS:
You want what, mate?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.220
Soda pop.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.955
I need a sample of
Senator Morra's soda pop.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.624
Hey, hey.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.192
Time-out on the fun words, okay?

19:19.226 --> 19:21.328
Just until we get back
into serial hugger territory.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.229
Why? Where are we?

19:22.262 --> 19:23.763
Uh, France.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.698
My parents took us
on vacation here

19:25.732 --> 19:27.234
when I was, like, ten.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.835
Or... I don't know.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.437
But I don't know
how it works down here.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.972
But the point is,
this part's not gross, okay?

19:33.005 --> 19:34.741
In fact, the blood...

19:34.774 --> 19:36.543
is kind of
a crucial detail here.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.646
Blood.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.382
I need a sample
of Senator Morra's blood.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.651
And it has to be clean, no NZT.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.319
And why do you need that?

19:46.353 --> 19:48.388
There may be
some lingering questions

19:48.421 --> 19:49.889
about the shooting--

19:49.922 --> 19:52.959
the fact that the sniper
was on NZT,

19:52.992 --> 19:55.262
the senator's
impressive reflexes,

19:55.295 --> 19:56.929
whether NZT

19:56.963 --> 19:59.266
may be involved in that.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.933
It's Rebecca Harris,
isn't it?

20:00.967 --> 20:01.934
Asking the questions?

20:01.968 --> 20:03.002
Doesn't matter who it is.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.804
What matters is that
they're smart.

20:04.837 --> 20:05.938
And it's only
a matter of time

20:05.972 --> 20:08.741
before they think of some way
to test their theory.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.678
The coat Senator Morra
wore that day

20:11.711 --> 20:13.546
is in an FBI evidence locker

20:13.580 --> 20:15.382
with his blood on it.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.251
Blood I'm pretty sure
would test positive for NZT

20:18.285 --> 20:19.319
is someone thinks to test it.

20:19.352 --> 20:22.555
And we certainly don't want her
doing that, do we?

20:22.589 --> 20:23.556
I didn't say

20:23.590 --> 20:24.557
it was Rebecca.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.293
What I am trying to say

20:26.326 --> 20:28.728
is that this little problem

20:28.761 --> 20:30.897
could actually be a blessing.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.399
I'm listening.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.733
If Senator Morra waits

20:33.766 --> 20:36.703
just a little bit between doses,
just long enough

20:36.736 --> 20:38.471
for us to draw blood,

20:38.505 --> 20:40.707
we could use
that clean blood,

20:40.740 --> 20:42.709
put it on a new, identical coat.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.312
I could swap it out
with the real one.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.381
And then they can test it
for NZT all they want.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.484
Let it be forensic proof
that their theory

20:51.518 --> 20:53.320
is wrong.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.954
Case closed.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.691
You know,
clock's ticking and stuff.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.929
You get it.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.599
And now I wait.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.602
But Andre Hannan
is still waiting for me.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.004
And how could someone
who says he did it--

21:12.038 --> 21:14.741
and who seems to believe
what he's saying--

21:14.774 --> 21:16.709
be innocent?

21:16.743 --> 21:19.446
I mean, the guy does seem
to be pretty troubled.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.715
Bipolar,
possible schizophrenia.

21:22.749 --> 21:26.353
He was seeing a psychiatrist
for most of his life.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.893
Interesting.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.463
Something you'd like to share?

21:39.699 --> 21:40.767
BOYLE:
Is this some kind

21:40.800 --> 21:42.068
of science fair project?

21:43.803 --> 21:45.638
I identified the problem

21:45.672 --> 21:47.707
and explored a hypothesis

21:47.740 --> 21:51.678
that somebody paid off
Andre Hannan to take the fall

21:51.711 --> 21:52.712
for these crimes.

21:52.745 --> 21:53.946
However,

21:53.980 --> 21:56.349
an examination of Hannan's
financial records

21:56.383 --> 21:59.018
showed no suspicious
influx of funds

21:59.051 --> 22:02.422
nor major outstanding debts.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.792
Uh, we have PowerPoint,
you know.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.060
So that brings us to
our next hypothesis.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.829
Andre Hannan...

22:11.498 --> 22:13.800
...wasn't lying.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.736
So you just made
all these posters

22:16.769 --> 22:19.005
to explain why you were
wrong about Hannan?

22:19.038 --> 22:20.573
Andre Hannan wasn't lying,
because he sincerely

22:20.607 --> 22:22.542
believes he did it.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.110
He remembers doing it.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.045
Even though he's innocent.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.948
What do you know
about optogenetics?

22:28.981 --> 22:30.817
Was that rhetorical?

22:30.850 --> 22:32.952
It's the manipulation

22:32.985 --> 22:34.787
of memory.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.557
Scientists can use blue light

22:37.590 --> 22:39.659
and a fiber-optic wire

22:39.692 --> 22:43.496
to make certain memory-oriented
neurons sensitive.

22:43.530 --> 22:46.933
It is going to
change the world!

22:46.966 --> 22:49.436
This is like
real-life Inception.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.971
No, we're only concerned
with the here and now, please.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.808
Right now

22:55.842 --> 22:58.177
neurons can be
genetically modified

22:58.210 --> 22:59.111
to be more sensitive

22:59.145 --> 23:00.913
to light.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.916
They respond to blue light

23:03.950 --> 23:06.453
from a fiber-optic wire inserted

23:06.486 --> 23:09.121
into the brain just like that.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.558
Now, researchers
recently reported

23:11.591 --> 23:14.961
using optogenetics
to implant a false memory

23:14.994 --> 23:16.763
into a mouse's brain.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.898
And I think somebody used it

23:18.931 --> 23:22.068
to plant false memories
of these huggings

23:22.101 --> 23:23.903
in Andre Hannan's brain.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.538
How would that work?
If you could activate

23:25.572 --> 23:27.006
Andre Hannan's neurons

23:27.039 --> 23:29.776
while he was in some kind
of hypnotic state,

23:29.809 --> 23:31.678
you could tell him
about the huggings.

23:31.711 --> 23:34.146
And with enough detail
and enough suggestions,

23:34.180 --> 23:35.915
he could actually

23:35.948 --> 23:38.751
incorporate the narrative
as his own memory.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.620
Finch, a mouse is one thing--

23:40.653 --> 23:42.221
BRIAN:
And it turns out

23:42.254 --> 23:44.757
that there's a project
at Hudson University--

23:44.791 --> 23:46.726
the New York Mind
and Memory Institute--

23:46.759 --> 23:49.028
that's been experimenting
with optogenetics

23:49.061 --> 23:51.130
as a potential treatment
for all kinds of things.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.999
PTSD,

23:53.032 --> 23:54.801
schizophrenia,
addiction.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.036
And one of the leading
researchers is a neuroscientist

23:57.069 --> 23:59.506
by the name
of Dr. Howard Gilroy.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.041
Now, Dr. Gilroy is also
a trained psychiatrist.

24:02.074 --> 24:05.011
Would you care to guess
who one of his patients was?

24:05.044 --> 24:06.879
Andre Hannan.
Bingo.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.215
HANNAN:
I don't get it.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.183
You guys keep showing up here.

24:11.217 --> 24:12.619
First the hand squeezers,

24:12.652 --> 24:13.820
then the polygraph.

24:13.853 --> 24:14.954
Now these?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.489
Yeah, we need
to shave your head.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.926
Do you remember Dr. Gilroy?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.061
The psychiatrist that treated
you a couple of years ago

24:22.094 --> 24:23.830
before you were arrested?

24:23.863 --> 24:25.498
Sure.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.133
Did he ever do any

24:27.166 --> 24:28.635
medical procedures

24:28.668 --> 24:29.969
involving your head?

24:30.002 --> 24:31.738
HANNAN:
Sort of.

24:31.771 --> 24:34.574
They tried some kind
of electronic stimulation

24:34.607 --> 24:36.242
to help with the depression.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.578
They had to put some wires
on my head for that.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.680
That wasn't
in the medical record.

24:40.713 --> 24:43.082
I think they did a lot
more than that, Andre.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.150
Were you conscious during this?

24:44.183 --> 24:45.184
Sort of.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.219
They doped me up
a lot, though.

24:47.253 --> 24:50.723
Did you ever notice
any kind of scar afterwards?

24:50.757 --> 24:53.025
What kind of scar?

24:58.998 --> 25:01.000
*

25:22.188 --> 25:23.389
See, this kind
of incision is exactly what

25:23.422 --> 25:26.325
it would look like if someone
inserted a fiber-optic wire

25:26.358 --> 25:28.227
into Andre Hannan's brain.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.630
You really think
that there is a doctor

25:30.663 --> 25:33.232
going into the brains
of unsuspecting patients

25:33.265 --> 25:36.002
and planting false memories
of hugs, no less?

25:36.035 --> 25:39.572
If the memories are false,
then how are they so accurate?

25:39.606 --> 25:40.973
Hannan's confession
matched the details

25:41.007 --> 25:43.075
of those huggings
almost exactly.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.578
So how would his doctor
know those things?

25:45.612 --> 25:47.614
Unless...
He was there.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.648
You think Hannan's
doctor is the one

25:48.681 --> 25:49.749
who's committed those huggings?

25:49.782 --> 25:50.917
We need to go talk
to that doctor.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.218
Couldn't agree more.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.253
(whirring and beeping)

25:56.956 --> 25:58.324
I'm the one
that called in the cavalry,

25:58.357 --> 25:59.859
so I can't keep
the cavalry waiting.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.128
And if they're
at the doctor's office,

26:02.161 --> 26:05.097
they definitely won't be
at the evidence locker.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.733
It's the perfect window.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.134
What are you waiting for?

26:08.167 --> 26:10.336
Um, you know what?
You guys just go on without me.

26:10.369 --> 26:12.271
It's your theory, Finch...

26:12.304 --> 26:13.372
I know, but

26:13.405 --> 26:14.941
my mom just texted me.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.342
My dad's not feeling very well,

26:16.375 --> 26:17.944
so she's gonna
take him to the doctor.

26:17.977 --> 26:18.945
Is it serious?

26:18.978 --> 26:20.079
I mean, he says
it's not,

26:20.112 --> 26:21.113
but he always says that.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.682
So I should probably go.

26:22.715 --> 26:23.916
Well, we can wait.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.084
No.
No, no, no, no.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.218
Look, I don't know what this is

26:26.252 --> 26:27.687
or how long
this is gonna take.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.921
This guy's messing
with people's brains

26:28.955 --> 26:30.289
and he might be a serial hugger.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.390
Yeah, he's right.
Let's go.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.692
Yeah, just keep
me posted.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.226
Yep.

26:38.665 --> 26:42.134
Is it strictly necessary
for you to break and enter?

26:43.670 --> 26:45.705
One navy blue
Brooks Brothers overcoat,

26:45.738 --> 26:48.941
identical to the one worn by
Senator Morra when he was shot.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.110
What about the blood?

26:51.143 --> 26:52.344
It's the senator's.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.346
And free of NZT.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.986
Wear gloves.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.654
And bring the baggage
out with you.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.355
Yeah, I know how to plant
evidence thanks to you guys.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.824
And I'm on NZT.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.298
Let me know when it's done.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.937
What can I do for you?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.272
Well, this is a photograph
of Andre Hannan,

27:20.306 --> 27:21.741
a former patient of yours.

27:21.774 --> 27:23.743
Andre Hannan
was convicted

27:23.776 --> 27:27.213
of four different huggings
between 2011 and 2014.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.415
He's on death row
in Pennsylvania.

27:29.448 --> 27:30.983
Of course.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.418
I remember Mr. Hannan.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.253
BOYLE:
And we think you had
something to do

27:34.286 --> 27:35.955
with what Mr. Hannan
remembers, too.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.356
REBECCA:
We think you implanted
false memories

27:37.389 --> 27:40.426
of him committing
those huggings into his brain.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.795
(chuckles)

27:42.829 --> 27:44.330
I'm sorry?

27:44.363 --> 27:47.299
You're working on cutting-edge
optogenetic technology here.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.768
To help people.

27:48.801 --> 27:51.270
To treat soldiers
with post-traumatic stress.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.740
Why would I try to make someone
think they had hugged somebody,

27:53.773 --> 27:55.074
much less four people?

27:58.945 --> 28:00.312
Oh.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.950
You think I'm responsible.

28:03.983 --> 28:07.086
You think I'm a serial hugger?

28:07.119 --> 28:09.321
Andre Hannan
lacked the strength

28:09.355 --> 28:12.091
to cuddle those victims
with his bare hands.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.425
But he happens to have
a psychiatrist who's involved

28:13.459 --> 28:15.227
in memory manipulation.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.695
What are the odds of that?

28:18.497 --> 28:20.266
And what are the odds of that?

28:23.870 --> 28:25.972
I cooperated with the FBI
during the investigation

28:26.005 --> 28:28.374
of Mr. Hannan to the
full extent of the law.

28:28.407 --> 28:29.375
With Mr. Hannan's consent,

28:29.408 --> 28:30.409
I turned over all records
of his treatment.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.212
All the records you wanted
to share, at least.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.084
(chuckles)

28:38.117 --> 28:39.886
You really think I did this?

28:39.919 --> 28:42.221
We'd like to know where you were
on the dates of the huggings.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.757
Just so we can rule things out.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.192
Happily.

28:46.225 --> 28:49.028
I keep meticulous records.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.830
Evidence Control.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.464
One of the most secure areas

28:52.498 --> 28:56.202
of the FBI, designed
expressly to prevent anyone

28:56.235 --> 28:58.971
from doing
what I'm about to do.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.206
This is
an Evidence Request Form

29:00.239 --> 29:01.340
with a fake signature

29:01.373 --> 29:03.042
from Special Agent
Arthur Vance.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.310
Add it to the list.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.912
In my defense, there are a lot

29:05.945 --> 29:08.147
of ridiculous laws
still on the books.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.082
Did you know that in New York,
a person may not walk around

29:10.116 --> 29:14.320
on Sundays with an ice cream
cone in his pocket, still?

29:14.353 --> 29:16.022
I.D.?
Oh, you bet ya.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.790
I whipped up an I.D.
and a profile

29:17.824 --> 29:18.991
for Agent Arthur Vance.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.260
I may have given him a few

29:21.293 --> 29:23.395
commendations.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.264
That's quite an impressive
service record, Agent Vance.

29:25.297 --> 29:26.332
Oh, just doing my part.
If you'll just wait right here,

29:26.365 --> 29:27.566
I'll be right back
with your items.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.269
Here I shall remain.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.004
From the moment
he stops typing,

29:32.038 --> 29:34.406
I've got about 30 seconds
until the security screen

29:34.440 --> 29:36.843
comes back and locks me out.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.330
Step one-- don't get
locked out of the computer.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.299
Check.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.401
Step two--
erase any evidence

30:02.434 --> 30:04.103
that I was here.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.537
Oops, these systems
can get so buggy.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.174
(phone ringing)

30:08.207 --> 30:10.042
REBECCA:
Hey, it's me.

30:10.076 --> 30:12.411
I know you're with your dad,
but Gilroy was a bust.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.446
He has alibis
for all the huggings.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.083
Boyle and I will confirm,
but it doesn't look good.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.450
He was so sure.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.353
Yeah, we should still run
down the alibis, though.

30:21.387 --> 30:23.189
Look, do you mind if we
swing through Brooklyn

30:23.222 --> 30:24.556
on the way back?

30:24.590 --> 30:26.058
"On the way back"?

30:26.092 --> 30:27.326
I want to check
something out.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.228
All right.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.200
Make sure
to request evidence

30:34.233 --> 30:36.502
from a current,
high-profile case.

30:36.535 --> 30:39.571
They keep that stuff
behind extra security.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.507
Buys me some time.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.385
(typing rapidly)

30:57.689 --> 30:59.358
(beeps)

31:10.502 --> 31:13.372
*

31:42.334 --> 31:44.436
*

31:48.174 --> 31:50.342
Damn it.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.044
The button.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.584
Great attention
to detail, Sands.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.301
Bathroom break, maybe.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.336
Or system's down.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.374
Hello?

32:37.256 --> 32:39.558
I got the left.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.693
*

32:46.632 --> 32:47.599
(clicking sound)

32:47.633 --> 32:49.468
(door closes)

32:49.501 --> 32:50.669
BRIAN:
What was that?

32:57.243 --> 32:59.611
(distant banging)

33:12.491 --> 33:13.525
BOYLE:
Reb, over here.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.740
(banging continues)

33:30.709 --> 33:32.111
Are you okay?

33:32.144 --> 33:34.480
Can you give me a hand?
I'm locked in.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.683
The system malfunctioned again.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.319
And the service
in here sucks.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.624
I still want
to get that coat.

33:52.398 --> 33:53.399
(alarm burbles, cuts off)

34:00.172 --> 34:03.142
You want to tell me what the
hell is going on here, Finch?

34:03.175 --> 34:05.777
I got a call from Howard Gilroy

34:05.811 --> 34:08.447
that the FBI is accusing him
of being a serial hugger,

34:08.480 --> 34:11.183
and then I find out
you're hanging out

34:11.217 --> 34:12.418
with Andre Hannan?

34:12.451 --> 34:14.320
Now, I don't know
what kind of stunt

34:14.353 --> 34:16.222
you think you're pulling here,

34:16.255 --> 34:18.290
but if you screw this up for me,

34:18.324 --> 34:20.626
I swear I will end you, damn it!

34:20.659 --> 34:23.729
I will freaking play
Cowboys and Indians with you

34:23.762 --> 34:25.497
until I cuddle you to sleep.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.433
Do you hear me, Finch?

34:27.466 --> 34:28.500
Do you hear me?!

34:36.775 --> 34:37.876
REBECCA:
Naz got a call

34:37.909 --> 34:39.445
from David Englander
this morning.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.180
Yeah. Me, too.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.482
He was kind of mad.
Well, can you blame him?

34:43.515 --> 34:46.352
We're trying to unravel
the case that made his career.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.619
As an author, at least.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.855
And we're not doing
the best job.

34:49.888 --> 34:51.457
Gilroy's alibis checked out.

34:51.490 --> 34:52.591
There's no way he's the hugger.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.726
But what about
Andre Hannan's head?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.428
I mean, where else
would he get that scar?

34:56.462 --> 34:57.229
I don't know.

34:57.263 --> 34:59.131
But even if Gilroy
did incept him,

34:59.165 --> 35:00.366
he wasn't at the huggings.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.500
So how could he
know what happened?

35:01.533 --> 35:02.801
(sighs)

35:08.440 --> 35:09.808
What if somebody told him?

35:09.841 --> 35:11.743
Who?
Well, I don't
know yet.

35:11.777 --> 35:14.346
But we know Gilroy wasn't
just a researcher.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.614
He was also
a practicing psychiatrist.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.483
I mean, he had
patients, like Andre

35:17.516 --> 35:19.551
and... other people, too, right?

35:19.585 --> 35:21.453
You think it was
another one of his patients?

35:21.487 --> 35:22.888
What better place
to confess to huggings

35:22.921 --> 35:24.590
than your psychiatrist?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.392
With the doctor-patient
privilege?

35:26.425 --> 35:27.693
It's one thing not to report it.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.661
But you think Gilroy
was actively trying

35:29.695 --> 35:31.497
to help a serial hugger cover?

35:31.530 --> 35:33.232
Why?

35:33.265 --> 35:34.500
Why does anyone do anything?

35:34.533 --> 35:36.168
Lust, money.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.803
Occasional sociopathy.

35:37.836 --> 35:38.704
Speaking of money,

35:38.737 --> 35:40.772
the New York
Mind and Memory Institute

35:40.806 --> 35:43.375
did just get
a $500 million investment.

35:43.409 --> 35:46.212
Really?
Yeah. Boyle found
an article

35:46.245 --> 35:47.646
when he was checking out
Gilroy's alibis.

35:47.679 --> 35:48.780
Who was it from?

35:48.814 --> 35:49.881
Alexander Bale.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.918
Oh, yeah, the tech guy, right?

35:52.951 --> 35:54.520
Wow, he must think
a lot of Gilroy

35:54.553 --> 35:56.355
to give him
half a billion dollars.

35:56.388 --> 35:57.389
Wonder how he knows him.

35:57.423 --> 35:58.824
Maybe Bale's a patient of his.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.826
That's what we need to find out.
Well, good luck,

36:00.859 --> 36:02.394
because Bale's
not gonna tell you

36:02.428 --> 36:05.397
and-and Gilroy doesn't have to.

36:05.431 --> 36:07.233
Doctor-patient privilege.

36:07.266 --> 36:10.536
I actually may know
a way around that.

36:10.569 --> 36:13.305
Hi. My name is Mike Ikerson

36:13.339 --> 36:14.706
and I require
immediate treatment

36:14.740 --> 36:17.376
for many destructive urges.
Is Dr. Gilroy available?

36:17.409 --> 36:19.411
I'll have to speak
to the doctor.
I don't mind waiting.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.247
Though... could I use
your restroom?

36:26.285 --> 36:28.587
Well, I didn't find
an Alexander Bale

36:28.620 --> 36:29.855
in Dr. Gilroy's patient files,

36:29.888 --> 36:34.526
but I did find his son.

36:34.560 --> 36:38.330
(dogs barking)

36:38.364 --> 36:40.999
So Alexander Bale's son
was in Dr. Gilroy's file?

36:41.032 --> 36:44.236
Nolan Bale.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.472
The doctor had some choice words
to say about his patient.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.706
"Lies with ease."

36:47.739 --> 36:48.807
"Sociopathic tendencies."

36:48.840 --> 36:51.810
So you think
Dr. Gilroy figured out

36:51.843 --> 36:54.246
that Nolan Bale
is Mr. Butter Pecan

36:54.280 --> 36:57.283
and he made a deal
with Nolan's billionaire father

36:57.316 --> 36:59.585
to set up Hannan
in exchange for a donation

36:59.618 --> 37:01.687
that would fund
his doctor's research

37:01.720 --> 37:03.422
for the rest of his life.

37:03.455 --> 37:06.292
And that has something to do
with us being in a dog park.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.759
You can convince someone else

37:07.793 --> 37:10.462
that they committed the huggings
that Nolan Bale did.

37:10.496 --> 37:12.864
You can't cure Nolan Bale
of the urge to hug.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.433
When he was active
as Mr. Butter Pecan,

37:14.466 --> 37:16.402
Nolan hugged someone

37:16.435 --> 37:17.903
every ten to 13 months.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.271
It was like clockwork.

37:19.305 --> 37:21.940
Mm-hmm. And if Nolan
hugged someone else,

37:21.973 --> 37:23.575
then everyone would know
that Hannan was innocent.

37:23.609 --> 37:24.776
Well, not necessarily.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.945
Mr. Butter Pecan
was known for hugging men.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.847
It was a huge part
of his profile.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.383
So if he got his rocks off
with a woman,

37:31.417 --> 37:32.918
no one would connect it.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.487
So I went through
every unsolved hug

37:35.521 --> 37:37.789
in the city
over the past year.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.791
And a couple
of months ago,

37:39.825 --> 37:41.593
someone picked up
a prostitute

37:41.627 --> 37:43.762
and cuddled her
until she went away

37:43.795 --> 37:45.030
to an awesome farm
in the country.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.499
He put about 300 pounds
of pressure on her neck.

37:47.533 --> 37:49.901
You think it was Nolan.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.003
Yeah. The woman,
Vanessa Chipman?

37:52.037 --> 37:53.572
She didn't go down easy.

37:53.605 --> 37:55.774
She played air guitar
with her attacker.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.909
His DNA was under
her fingernails.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.912
Yeah, but you got all this stuff
from Nolan's medical file.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.481
We can't compel DNA samples.

38:02.514 --> 38:03.882
No.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.384
But what if we just
happened to be around

38:05.417 --> 38:07.386
when he offered
one up?

38:07.419 --> 38:08.587
Would you hold this?
Thank you.
Sure.

38:08.620 --> 38:09.721
Excuse me.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.056
Hi.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.991
Do you mind if I shave your dog?

38:14.826 --> 38:16.795
It's in the name of justice.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.568
(elevator bell dings)

38:22.601 --> 38:24.069
BRIAN:
I went to the building
where Nolan works

38:24.102 --> 38:26.572
and spent a couple of hours
hanging out in the elevator.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.073
Eventually...

38:28.106 --> 38:29.675
(elevator bell dings)
...I struck gold.

38:33.712 --> 38:34.880
(sniffs)

38:34.913 --> 38:35.881
(clears throat)

38:35.914 --> 38:38.584
(coughing)

38:38.617 --> 38:39.685
Dude, you okay?

38:39.718 --> 38:41.119
Yeah. (coughs)

38:41.152 --> 38:42.988
I just, um...

38:43.021 --> 38:44.956
Is that dog hair
on your coat?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.992
Oh, my God,
look at that.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.494
(coughing)

38:48.527 --> 38:50.729
(sneezes)

38:50.762 --> 38:52.731
What the hell'd
you do that for?

38:52.764 --> 38:53.899
Hygiene.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.068
Have a good day.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.404
(sneezes)

39:00.739 --> 39:01.807
REPORTER:
Psychiatrist Howard Gilroy

39:01.840 --> 39:05.043
was arrested today for his part
in a bizarre attempt

39:05.076 --> 39:07.946
to frame Andre Hannan
and cover up the crimes

39:07.979 --> 39:10.982
committed by Nolan Bale, son of
billionaire Alexander Bale,

39:11.016 --> 39:12.784
who was also arrested.

39:12.818 --> 39:14.486
Details remain sketchy
about the exact nature

39:14.520 --> 39:15.921
of the conspiracy,
but authorities...

39:15.954 --> 39:18.056
ENGLANDER:
Well, you did it, Finch.

39:18.089 --> 39:20.392
You proved me wrong.

39:20.426 --> 39:22.928
(TV shuts off)

39:22.961 --> 39:26.064
Hear Andre Hannan's
getting out soon.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.099
Man, did you fly up here

39:28.133 --> 39:30.402
just to apologize
to me in person?

39:30.436 --> 39:32.704
If that's what it takes.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.607
What is this place, anyway?

39:35.641 --> 39:37.443
It's my headquarters.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.077
They just finished it.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.779
Pretty cool,
right?

39:40.812 --> 39:42.748
Yeah. Whatever.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.851
Well, they're pulling my book
off the shelves as we speak.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.018
Hmm.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.020
But hey, you know...

39:49.054 --> 39:50.088
Me, personally,

39:50.121 --> 39:52.190
I'd rather light a candle
than curse the darkness.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.159
And this story,
Brian, your story?

39:54.192 --> 39:55.827
The memory implants

39:55.861 --> 39:57.529
and the innocent man
on death row?

39:57.563 --> 39:58.564
That's better than what I had.

39:58.597 --> 40:00.566
And it happens to be true.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.434
And we can sell it, Brian.

40:02.468 --> 40:03.969
Come on. Fifty-fifty.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.173
My name. My rep.

40:08.206 --> 40:11.209
Your story.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.578
Brian, don't be stubborn.

40:12.611 --> 40:13.912
Come on, it's business.

40:14.946 --> 40:16.114
Sixty-forty.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.649
I'll build you a headquarters

40:17.683 --> 40:19.885
with your own damn cotton candy
machine if you want.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.696
(sighs)

40:30.729 --> 40:31.830
There you are.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.865
* So let me hammer

40:33.899 --> 40:35.901
* This point home

40:35.934 --> 40:39.671
* I see us all as lonely fires

40:39.705 --> 40:41.673
* That have burned alive

40:41.707 --> 40:43.141
* As long as we remember...

40:43.174 --> 40:45.944
You know Rebecca's gonna
figure it out, right?

40:45.977 --> 40:47.913
The chip on the button?

40:47.946 --> 40:52.884
You didn't get that
exactly right.

40:52.918 --> 40:55.821
Did you seriously think
she wouldn't notice?

40:55.854 --> 40:58.223
Well, it wasn't exactly
optimal circumstances.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.626
And you were on NZT.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.695
To get it right,
all you had to do

41:03.729 --> 41:07.098
was two seconds of extra effort.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.668
She's gonna notice.

41:09.701 --> 41:12.170
But maybe that's
what you wanted, huh?

41:12.203 --> 41:13.271
Hmm?

41:13.304 --> 41:14.906
She'll keep
poking around,

41:14.940 --> 41:18.910
and eventually, maybe,

41:18.944 --> 41:20.646
she'll find you.

41:20.679 --> 41:23.048
Yes, Josh,
that's exactly what I want.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.050
I want to get caught
committing a felony.

41:25.083 --> 41:29.154
Things that happen
down where I live

41:29.187 --> 41:30.922
don't always make sense

41:30.956 --> 41:32.257
at first, up here.

41:32.290 --> 41:36.061
Look. You hate your life.

41:36.094 --> 41:37.663
Lying.

41:37.696 --> 41:38.864
Why not make it impossible?

41:38.897 --> 41:41.099
It's not just about me.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.535
It's my family...

41:43.569 --> 41:46.104
Rebecca-- all this
will kill them.

41:46.137 --> 41:50.208
Maybe we could, uh...
before I go?

41:50.241 --> 41:52.911
Josh-o-saurus Josh can't smoke.

41:52.944 --> 41:55.814
A) you're not real, Josh.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.917
B) you're a role model to kids.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.552
I retired.

42:00.586 --> 42:05.090
* They will not last the year

42:05.123 --> 42:07.826
* But expire like

42:07.859 --> 42:11.763
* A sudden shooting star

42:11.797 --> 42:14.933
* That only nightingales

42:14.966 --> 42:16.134
* Had seen

42:16.167 --> 42:19.971
* Before transforming
into bluebirds *

42:20.005 --> 42:21.607
* And in this way

42:21.640 --> 42:23.609
* You will come find me

42:23.642 --> 42:25.644
* In December.
