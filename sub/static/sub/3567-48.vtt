00:31.425 --> 00:34.310
Give me the ...
Oh, thanks.

00:34.378 --> 00:37.680
- Eh, I saw you guys coming.
- Are you closing up

00:37.748 --> 00:38.948
- all by yourself?
- Yeah.

00:39.016 --> 00:40.650
- It's just me tonight.
- Wow.

00:40.718 --> 00:43.236
That's a lot of responsibility
for a kid your age.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.904
Hey, your dad must really trust you.

00:45.022 --> 00:48.691
- Don't patronize me, sir.
- See you, Peedee!

00:48.742 --> 00:51.803
So, like I was saying,
Peridot's been shooting huge

00:51.804 --> 00:54.864
robots here from space.
And when you smash them,

00:54.915 --> 00:57.367
- they explode into goo.
- That sounds scary.

00:57.418 --> 01:00.753
You know, I'm not sure if ...
Do you ever feel like this gem

01:00.871 --> 01:02.755
- stuff is too much for you?
- What do you ...

01:02.873 --> 01:05.792
Oh!

01:10.381 --> 01:14.183
What the hey was that?!
Steven?

01:14.218 --> 01:17.854
- Is that a hand?
- The light cannons

01:17.921 --> 01:19.522
- should be ready.
- Guys!

01:19.590 --> 01:21.290
Did you see that thing in the sky?

01:21.358 --> 01:23.660
It's a ship.
We have to assume it's Peridot.

01:23.727 --> 01:26.529
Lapis told us she'd
be coming with advanced

01:26.597 --> 01:29.165
- weapons and reinforcements.
- It's happening.

01:29.233 --> 01:33.724
I want to see.
Whoa!

01:33.904 --> 01:37.707
Ready the light cannons!

01:39.048 --> 01:41.661
Steven, light 'em up.

01:41.745 --> 01:43.830
If every pork chop
were perfect...

01:43.914 --> 01:46.582
<i>we wouldn't have hot dogs.</i>

01:57.010 --> 01:59.429
- No affect.
- What now?

01:59.563 --> 02:01.264
We'll have to take them head on.

02:01.315 --> 02:02.815
The whole town might be in danger.

02:02.900 --> 02:06.436
I better make a call.
Time for some...

02:06.520 --> 02:09.354
<i>political favors.</i>

02:09.440 --> 02:11.774
- Hello?
- Mayor Dewey, it's me,

02:11.859 --> 02:13.609
- Steven Universe.
- Universe!

02:13.660 --> 02:17.480
What's this thing in the sky?
As a politician, pointing

02:17.548 --> 02:21.384
- fingers make me very nervous.
- Mayor Dewey,

02:21.452 --> 02:22.836
the whole town's in danger.

02:22.837 --> 02:24.220
<i>We have to evacuate the city.</i>

02:24.288 --> 02:25.855
Evacuate? Hmm.

02:25.923 --> 02:28.424
Evacuate.
Could be tough. Um...

02:28.492 --> 02:32.762
I'll need a catchy slogan.
Eva-cu-ate!

02:32.796 --> 02:36.599
<i>Eva-cu-ate!
Eva-cu-ate!</i>

02:36.633 --> 02:39.552
<i>Eva-cu-ate!</i>

02:39.636 --> 02:44.962
People! I need everyone
to consider evacuation.

02:44.997 --> 02:47.477
<i>Evacuation is something we all</i>

02:47.561 --> 02:51.314
<i>- depend on in times of trauma!
- Oh, hey.</i>

02:51.365 --> 02:53.533
That's a great idea, Dad.
You should leave with

02:53.617 --> 02:57.320
the rest of ...
Is that my luggage?

02:57.404 --> 03:00.031
- Uh...
- Who wants to tell him?

03:00.032 --> 03:04.420
Hey, I'm not good
with this stuff.

03:05.498 --> 03:08.898
Steven, I know you
don't think we trust you.

03:08.899 --> 03:12.163
I know more often than not,
we treat you like a human child.

03:12.241 --> 03:14.554
But the truth is we rely on you.

03:14.671 --> 03:19.175
Your voice inspires us, binds us,
 reminds us why we promised

03:19.259 --> 03:22.895
to protect the planet.
You must now be that voice...

03:22.980 --> 03:24.847
- for them.
- Peedee, come on!

03:24.932 --> 03:27.900
- When are we coming back?!
- Ronaldo, help me with your brother!

03:27.985 --> 03:30.353
If anything happens,

03:30.437 --> 03:33.856
you need to be there to protect
them, like your mother once did.

03:33.907 --> 03:39.288
- It's your destiny.
- I won't disappoint you.

03:39.323 --> 03:40.836
I know.

03:45.906 --> 03:48.538
We did everything we could.

03:48.622 --> 03:50.706
All right. Pull it together.

03:50.757 --> 03:55.545
<i>Eva-cu-ate.
Eva-cu-ate.</i>

03:57.514 --> 04:00.716
Maybe when Peridot
gets to Earth, she'll see how

04:00.801 --> 04:04.103
nice all the people are and
she won't want to hurt anyone.

04:04.221 --> 04:07.523
- Just like your mother.
- Yeah?

04:07.558 --> 04:10.393
Yeah.
But these other gems aren't

04:10.477 --> 04:12.562
like your mother.
They're not like Garnet,

04:12.646 --> 04:15.198
Amethyst, or Pearl.
They're not gonna start caring

04:15.232 --> 04:17.399
about people now.
They didn't the first time they...

04:17.534 --> 04:22.655
- The first time they what?
- I mean, it was thousands

04:22.739 --> 04:24.574
of years ago.
It's ... It's not like I was there.

04:28.298 --> 04:31.548
The gems should be telling you
all this stuff, but I get it.

04:31.549 --> 04:32.882
I mean, they don't want you

04:32.916 --> 04:36.825
- thinking of them like that.
- Like what?

04:38.338 --> 04:41.557
- Dad, like what?
- Like aliens, Steven!

04:41.592 --> 04:44.727
- Aliens who invaded Earth!
- What?

04:44.761 --> 04:47.813
All they do is try to make up
for it, but they just can't

04:47.898 --> 04:50.650
<i>forgive themselves.
Do you understand?</i>

04:50.734 --> 04:54.353
<i>Look, they were doing
something awful to the planet,</i>

04:54.438 --> 04:56.355
<i>and your mother couldn't
stand it anymore.</i>

04:56.440 --> 04:59.442
<i>She told me that's why she had
to turn on her own kind.</i>

04:59.526 --> 05:02.445
<i>She gave up everything just
to stop what they started here</i>

05:02.496 --> 05:04.780
<i>and drive the invading
gems off of Earth.</i>

05:04.865 --> 05:07.116
So, sh-she saved the world.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.502
- That's good!
- Uh, no such thing as a good

05:09.586 --> 05:12.371
war, kiddo.
Gems were destroyed.

05:12.456 --> 05:14.924
People, too.
In the end, your mother could

05:14.992 --> 05:17.126
<i>only save a handful of her
closest friends.</i>

05:17.210 --> 05:21.023
If it weren't for her shield ...
man, I don't know.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.685
Bu-but hey.
Let's look on the bright side!

05:25.769 --> 05:28.304
We're gonna drive by that waffle
place in a couple miles.

05:28.355 --> 05:31.357
We got to go back!
Turn the van around!

05:31.441 --> 05:33.225
No way!
The gems don't want you going back.

05:33.310 --> 05:35.144
I know they're just

05:35.228 --> 05:37.446
trying to protect me, but I have
to protect them.

05:37.531 --> 05:39.565
I have Mom's shield.
They need me!

05:39.650 --> 05:42.451
- I need you, too!
- Please, Dad!

05:42.486 --> 05:44.487
What if they get hurt?

05:44.572 --> 05:48.312
Dad, turn around! Dad!

05:49.270 --> 05:52.077
Turn the van around, please!

05:57.668 --> 06:00.419
Steven!

06:00.504 --> 06:02.338
- Dad...
- Yo, Greg!

06:02.422 --> 06:05.841
Are you and your kid okay?

06:05.892 --> 06:08.260
Yeah! Yeah. We're fine.
We're fine.

06:08.345 --> 06:11.147
Dad, please.
I have to go back.

06:11.181 --> 06:13.349
I have to.
They don't have my shield.

06:13.483 --> 06:18.354
- Do you ... Do you understand?
- Yeah. Okay.

06:18.438 --> 06:22.825
Just be careful or I'm gonna run
fresh out of family.

06:22.859 --> 06:24.910
Stay with everyone
and keep them safe.

06:24.995 --> 06:28.531
I'll figure out some way
to get back to Beach City.

06:28.615 --> 06:32.055
Steven: Oh, this'll work.

06:36.340 --> 06:39.208
- Come on. Pick up.
- You have reached

06:39.259 --> 06:41.210
<i>- the Maheswaran residence.
- Aw!</i>

06:41.261 --> 06:42.878
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

06:42.929 --> 06:44.547
<i>And keep it short.</i>

06:44.631 --> 06:46.716
<i>Hey, Connie.
It's Steven.</i>

06:46.800 --> 06:49.185
<i>Just seeing what you
were up to.</i>

06:49.219 --> 06:51.804
<i>Uh, don't know if you knew, but
there's some crazy stuff going</i>

06:51.888 --> 06:55.641
<i>on with a giant space hand,
and we all might die, so, uh...</i>

06:55.726 --> 06:58.611
<i>I guess call me back when you
get this, and talk to you soon!</i>

06:58.695 --> 07:01.230
Uh, bye!

07:10.407 --> 07:12.324
Fire!

07:18.415 --> 07:20.750
Stay here.
If something happens,

07:20.834 --> 07:22.752
Dad will need a new son.

07:28.258 --> 07:29.809
At least Steven is safe.

07:29.893 --> 07:32.395
<i>- Hey, guys!
- Steven!</i>

07:34.081 --> 07:35.731
You came back!

07:35.766 --> 07:38.571
What are you doing?!
Get out of here!

07:38.606 --> 07:41.687
- But ...
- It's too late. Just stay behind us.

07:49.946 --> 07:51.747
Uh...

08:05.462 --> 08:08.681
That's them all right.
They're the ones that keep

08:08.765 --> 08:12.852
- breaking my machines.
- This is it?

08:12.936 --> 08:19.809
Jasper! They keep interfering
with my work!

08:19.860 --> 08:23.646
Looks like another waste of my time.

08:23.697 --> 08:26.869
Hey, get over here.

08:28.618 --> 08:31.487
- Lapis.
- This is their base?

08:31.538 --> 08:34.206
- Yes.
- You need to leave immediately.

08:34.291 --> 08:36.542
Yeah, step off!

08:36.626 --> 08:38.744
This is not
a gem-controlled planet.

08:39.029 --> 08:41.547
Neither of you saw Rose Quartz?

08:41.664 --> 08:44.583
Oh, what a shame.
I hoped to meet her.

08:44.668 --> 08:47.803
I was looking forward to beating
her into the ground.

08:47.838 --> 08:50.422
- Oh.
- But this is all that's left

08:50.507 --> 08:53.509
of her army?
Some lost, defective Pearl,

08:53.593 --> 08:57.513
a puny, overcooked runt,
and this shameless display?

08:57.581 --> 09:01.350
Hmm.
What is that?

09:01.434 --> 09:04.687
- It calls itself the Steven.
- He's just a human.

09:04.738 --> 09:07.523
He isn't a threat at all.
He ... He's not one of them!

09:07.607 --> 09:11.193
I know what a human is.
You don't need me for this.

09:11.244 --> 09:15.698
- Just blast them with the ship.
- Fine.

09:23.590 --> 09:25.674
Steven, get out of here!

09:25.759 --> 09:27.793
- No!
- I won't let you risk your life.

09:27.878 --> 09:29.762
But this is my home,

09:29.846 --> 09:36.719
- and you're all my family!
- Firing.

09:36.770 --> 09:40.472
I'm ...
I'm a Crystal Gem, too!

09:43.527 --> 09:47.897
That shield.

09:47.981 --> 09:52.735
That symbol!

09:52.819 --> 09:54.236
You!

09:54.371 --> 09:56.572
You have the power of Rose Quartz!

09:56.623 --> 10:01.544
- Now do you believe I needed an escort?
- Fire a barrage, wide spread!

10:05.749 --> 10:11.337
Rose, why do you look like that?
Why are you so weak?

10:11.421 --> 10:13.923
- Don't hurt him!
- You knew about this!

10:13.990 --> 10:16.225
It wasn't relevant to the mission!

10:16.259 --> 10:18.310
- Forget about the mission.
- What?!

10:18.428 --> 10:21.313
Yellow diamond needs
to see this... thing.

10:21.398 --> 10:28.604
- Uh, uh...
- Good.

10:28.688 --> 10:33.275
- Steven, run!
- Priming gem destabilizer.

10:47.874 --> 10:53.012
I was there, you know, at the
first war for this garbage planet.

10:53.013 --> 10:54.715
I fought against your armies.

10:54.750 --> 10:59.487
I respected your tactics.
But this...

11:00.020 --> 11:03.138
- this is sick.
- Unhand him!

11:03.189 --> 11:06.609
I don't get what you're planning,
Rose, but look.

11:06.643 --> 11:10.229
<i>Your base is taken.
Your armies are ruined.</i>

11:10.313 --> 11:13.416
You have failed!
