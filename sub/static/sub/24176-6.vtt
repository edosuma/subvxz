01:32.175 --> 01:36.885
- Where are you going?
- To sleep on the sofa. Goodnight.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.130
I don't like sleeping alone.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.050
- No?
- No.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.105
Is this what you did
when you thought about me?

02:55.300 --> 02:57.462
What's up?

03:02.432 --> 03:07.393
Well, isn't this what
you've always wanted?

03:59.030 --> 04:01.692
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.200
JULY 7th

04:04.286 --> 04:06.072
Certainly...

04:06.913 --> 04:10.281
- What are we working on?
- A new weekly, "Noi".

04:10.375 --> 04:14.039
- Mondadori's targeting families.
- The boss wants us to do the launch.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.837
Families? Not my strong point.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.709
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Company match.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.301
I'm second,
if I score today, I'll be first.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.300
â€œBehind every family,
there's a lone woman...

04:25.515 --> 04:28.928
A survey says so,
it calls them "the lone women".

04:29.019 --> 04:31.556
48% of Fininvest's TV viewers.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.434
Widows, pensioners,
women from the South.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.856
Reduced spending,
especially on culture.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.019
Berlusconi changed their lives,
with Dallas and soap operas.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.024
Let's target them.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.607
Did you say "first"?
Isn't it a team game?

04:44.659 --> 04:47.321
The players take turns,
the score is individual.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.245
Draw: 1, win: 2, score: 3.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.789
I'll score today.
Shit, I can feel it!

04:53.460 --> 04:54.916
Who'll be on the cover:

04:55.003 --> 04:58.212
Carlucci, Parietti
or Dalla Chiesa marrying Frizzi?

04:58.381 --> 05:01.419
Van Basten, Walter Zenga.

05:01.635 --> 05:02.966
A mirror.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.087
A mirror, yes.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.471
So everyone will feel like
the protagonist.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.889
"Stop for a moment, fragile creature
and consider what you are".

05:13.480 --> 05:17.018
"The Cloud of Unknowing"
by an unknown English mystic.

05:18.401 --> 05:21.689
- I like the mirror idea.
- Sir?

05:21.863 --> 05:23.820
Gianni Letta's here to see you.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.445
- Did we have an appointment?
- No.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.485
I have to go, excuse me.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.013
How are you?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.599
Everything okay?

05:53.728 --> 05:55.139
Yeah.

06:01.152 --> 06:04.065
- Have you had a screw?
- Fuck off!

06:05.031 --> 06:09.616
If Magic Johnson's in the Olympics
then why can't you have a screw?

06:09.786 --> 06:12.949
The Australians have said
they won't play against Magic.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.531
- They're scared of getting AIDS.
- I know.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.992
Did you hear
what Charles Barkley said?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.747
You don't have work to do?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.629
No.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.628
Please, come this way.

06:26.803 --> 06:30.046
- Take a seat, I'll be right there.
- Shit, it's Ligresti.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.644
When we found your villa empty,

06:41.234 --> 06:43.475
we thought
you'd gone back to Sicily.

06:43.695 --> 06:47.108
As you can see, I'm here now.
And I came of my own free will.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.617
Yes, you've taken a few days off
to sort some things out.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.078
The industrialists are talking,
Ligresti.

06:55.832 --> 07:00.167
- It's the end of an era.
- Di Pietro...

07:01.046 --> 07:06.587
You're in the headlines now,
you feel loved by the people, powerful!

07:07.260 --> 07:10.469
So you keep making
the investigation bigger.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.760
But one of these days,
by casting the net further,

07:13.850 --> 07:16.638
you'll catch the small fish too.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.934
When the Italians realize
Clean Hands is homing in on them,

07:21.107 --> 07:24.691
on that day,
you and your colleagues...

07:25.236 --> 07:30.697
will end up alone,
from one moment to the next.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.739
And things will go back
to the way they were in Italy.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.030
Don't you believe me?

07:38.249 --> 07:40.616
Do you want to bet?

07:41.127 --> 07:44.245
Let's do this: you take this

07:45.048 --> 07:49.337
and return it to me when you explain
your business with Craxi.

07:52.639 --> 07:57.759
If that's the case,
kiss your precious watch goodbye.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.637
We'll talk about it in San Vittore.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.015
How come
you're going to the airport?

08:05.110 --> 08:06.066
JULY 12th

08:06.152 --> 08:09.019
Because I'm on the mafia's blacklist
along with other judges.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.446
It seems they want to kill us.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.657
Those idiot guards should escort me,
but I don't trust them.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.411
- Are you up to it?
- Yes.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.410
- Are you scared?
- No.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.912
Hi, Di Pietro.

08:23.169 --> 08:26.036
Schifani worked with Falcone,
and he's dead.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.257
- The watch you gave to Ligresti...
- It's fake.

08:31.553 --> 08:35.217
We seized a load of them
six months ago.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.390
What if Ligresti's right?

08:39.227 --> 08:42.219
Davigo already tried to nab them
six years ago.

08:42.397 --> 08:46.356
They never end up paying,
they always find a way out,

08:46.609 --> 08:49.647
and we work our asses off,
will it pay off?

08:49.821 --> 08:51.653
- Yes.
- Will they win?

08:51.823 --> 08:54.315
- No.
- No, yes, you're so damn eloquent!

08:54.576 --> 08:57.910
First you resign,
then you volunteer...

08:58.121 --> 09:00.453
I can't figure you out, dammit!

09:21.394 --> 09:22.509
Hi

09:23.438 --> 09:25.975
Is this where I sign up
for Actor's Studio?

09:26.191 --> 09:28.228
- Giuliano.
- Veronica.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.567
You're interested in the method?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.941
I've been told that to be an actress
I need to learn to act.

09:34.032 --> 09:38.651
- Have any experience?
- No, but my mother was an actress.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.702
Your mother? What's her name?

09:41.039 --> 09:43.030
You don't know her.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.616
She did experimental theatre.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.827
You make it sound
like it's something weird.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.792
So, how much is it?

09:52.300 --> 09:57.170
"At very high temperature, such
ionizing radiation from depleted uranium

09:57.347 --> 10:01.011
can modify the structure
and emit neutrons".

10:01.643 --> 10:04.226
- Ionizing radiation.
- Yes.

10:04.395 --> 10:08.389
You can't just say
your usual bullshit!

10:09.234 --> 10:11.566
It's all written here.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.368
Hi.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.164
He's Massimo, an old friend.
She's Veronica.

10:27.877 --> 10:28.992
Hi.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.376
Not too shabby, Pietro Bosco!

10:34.634 --> 10:38.218
I get cancer and you get to screw
that hot babe?

10:38.388 --> 10:40.629
Keep your goddamn voice down!

10:41.850 --> 10:44.387
- Give me that paper.
- Here.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.314
I signed up for an acting course.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.397
A serious one.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.025
It's American,
run by the Actor's Studio.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.577
Okay.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.533
Fine, bye.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.043
Wait!

11:14.591 --> 11:16.377
Fucking hell!

11:17.051 --> 11:21.636
It's good. If that's what
you want to do, that's good.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.219
It's expensive, I'm warning you.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.760
How much?

11:33.985 --> 11:35.646
Here.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.649
Two million liras?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.572
<i>Pass me a pen.</i>

12:02.388 --> 12:03.924
I have bad news for us.

12:04.015 --> 12:08.054
Fininvest found out about
your forays in Rome

12:08.228 --> 12:10.014
and your meeting with Segni.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.312
They want to close
the Study Campus.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.019
What?

12:15.401 --> 12:19.019
"Politics is not within
Publitalia's jurisdiction".

12:20.156 --> 12:21.646
What?

12:21.824 --> 12:26.034
Advertisers have increased in numbers
since the Study Campus opened.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.828
What's this about?

12:28.039 --> 12:31.623
For the agency, backing this project
is a waste of money,

12:31.834 --> 12:34.622
so as of tomorrow,
your office is closed.

12:34.837 --> 12:38.250
Those who've come from Publitalia
will remain within the group,

12:38.383 --> 12:42.843
the others, many thanks,
will receive adequate compensation.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.762
- What's Berlusconi saying?
- What do you think?

12:46.391 --> 12:48.632
It's his decision.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.092
Get me an appointment with him.

12:51.312 --> 12:54.395
Even just for 5 minutes,
I'll get him to change his mind...

12:54.649 --> 12:57.562
He's on holiday,
he's enjoying Milan's victory

12:57.652 --> 12:59.188
and he wants to be left in peace.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.816
I'm sorry, that's the way it is.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.326
What a shame.

13:25.388 --> 13:29.097
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Viola, you want to go on holiday?

13:48.036 --> 13:50.403
I think you've forgotten where it is.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.697
When I came here 10 years ago,
there was nothing.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.621
You sound like an old man,
I'm telling you.

13:58.963 --> 13:59.919
There it is!

14:13.144 --> 14:14.851
Amanda!

14:15.730 --> 14:19.223
Hi! Welcome!

14:22.820 --> 14:24.857
- How are you?
- You look beautiful.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.321
- Thanks.
- Sorry for calling out of the blue.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.404
Don't be, it's a pleasure!

14:29.702 --> 14:31.818
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.871
Shall I get your annexe ready?

14:35.625 --> 14:39.835
- You're sure it's no trouble?
- Sure! Stay as long as you like.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.583
It's a real pleasure for me.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.045
You've not changed, that's for sure.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.972
- Mum, I'm going out. I need money.
- Good evening!

14:52.141 --> 14:55.850
My daughter, Angelica.
That's right, I have a daughter.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.852
She looks just like you.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.356
Here. Only horribly younger.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.310
- How old are you?
- 15.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.238
It's a challenge
having a daughter that age.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.695
- I'm going, bye.
- Bye!

15:11.035 --> 15:12.696
I can imagine.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.029
Viola, my daughter.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.786
- Can you add an extra bed?
- Of course.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.334
- Hello, my dear.
- This is Amanda.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.003
Sit down.

15:31.389 --> 15:35.098
You called me for this? I hoped
you'd tell me Di Pietro's fate.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.968
I've got Beatrice Mainaghi,
ready to ruin her father.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.307
Isn't that enough?

15:40.648 --> 15:42.855
This blood story is a real scoop.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.857
How did you find out?

15:45.653 --> 15:49.396
A friend of mine contracted AIDS
via a blood transfusion.

15:49.824 --> 15:54.614
He tried suing them, it was tough,
so I gave him a hand.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.163
I found an informer at Zenit
who confirmed the story.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.033
The blood comes from America.

16:01.252 --> 16:04.210
The donors are prisoners
from Arkansas.

16:04.380 --> 16:08.089
Zenit bought their blood cheaply
and didn't test it.

16:08.593 --> 16:12.587
They used it to make blood products
to sell to the State

16:12.805 --> 16:15.297
who distributed them to hospitals.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.308
Is Beatrice Mainaghi your informer?

16:19.395 --> 16:22.854
No, it's someone
from the buyers' sector.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.357
I spoke to him, then he disappeared.

16:26.611 --> 16:27.976
Do you trust her?

16:28.613 --> 16:33.403
She said she'll give you free access
to Zenit's archives, she seems honest.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.450
How did you persuade her?

16:38.039 --> 16:40.326
Do you want to do
this interview or not?

16:49.926 --> 16:53.760
- Will you get the boxes?
- Yes.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.776
Isn't it creepy coming to live
where your father died?

17:09.945 --> 17:10.902
No.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.988
- You're brave.
- Very brave!

17:14.534 --> 17:17.026
I spoke to my journalist friend,

17:17.244 --> 17:20.032
she's willing to interview you.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.156
What should I say?

17:23.251 --> 17:26.618
That you want the truth
about that blood too

17:26.837 --> 17:28.999
and that you weren't involved.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.383
You're sure you want to do it?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.925
Are you sure it's his fault?

17:38.933 --> 17:40.048
Yes.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.512
All right.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.229
Everyone will hate you.

17:46.399 --> 17:51.610
My brother already hates me
because he thinks I stole his job.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.576
What documents do you need?

18:06.961 --> 18:12.377
Today the committee is gathered
with the Defense Minister, Salvo Andi).

18:16.304 --> 18:19.296
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18:24.270 --> 18:29.310
Today's agenda deals with
the presentation by the minister

18:29.525 --> 18:33.610
of military expenditure items
included in the financial bill.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.654
And about how these
have been articulated

18:36.824 --> 18:40.317
following the recent
parliamentary debate.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.738
Honorable... Bosco.

18:46.834 --> 18:51.704
Instead of talking about money,
let's discuss our soldiers' health.

18:53.507 --> 18:58.252
The Defense Committee should worry
about its soldiers, every so often.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.545
Pass these round.

19:01.307 --> 19:05.050
Many survivors from the Gulf War
have fallen ill.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.181
What are these papers?

19:07.313 --> 19:11.932
A list of the illnesses that NATO soldiers
back from Iraq suffer from.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.900
Take one.

19:14.195 --> 19:17.608
It shows how many American soldiers
fell ill in the past year.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.399
But no one's talking about it here.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.076
We fought alongside them,
our men got ill too.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.154
- Honorable Bosco...
- Our men are ill!

19:26.791 --> 19:29.328
Honorable Bosco, what are you doing?

19:29.502 --> 19:33.245
The minister is here today,
we have to discuss the financial bill.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.794
It's the Presidency's decision.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.876
If you have a question
for the Committee,

19:39.970 --> 19:43.053
we'll include it on the agenda
of the next meeting.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.056
What a drag!

19:45.685 --> 19:48.393
And now, please
gather your paperwork.

19:48.729 --> 19:52.848
No, keep it,
so you can read them for next time.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.394
Go ahead, sir.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.028
Good morning, dear colleagues.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.037
- Mr Bosco?
- Colonel Maggioni...

20:08.249 --> 20:12.038
- May I ask you a question?
- You just did.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.836
- Are you a patriot?
- I'm a Northern League member.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.833
Answer me.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.632
You're a soldier, right?

20:19.844 --> 20:22.632
Only a military man is interested
in soldiers' health.

20:22.805 --> 20:26.844
- So? ls that a problem?
- Regarding these illnesses...

20:27.393 --> 20:31.227
are you sure your sources
of information are reliable?

20:31.397 --> 20:35.641
Shit, I get it. The minister
handed you the note.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.022
You've come to lecture me!

20:39.405 --> 20:43.569
You know why I asked you that?
Because you're no patriot,

20:43.659 --> 20:46.242
you're slinging mud
at the Italian Navy!

20:46.412 --> 20:48.870
Have you been to Iraq?

20:49.415 --> 20:55.036
Swear on your children's lives that
we never used depleted uranium there.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.370
We never used it.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.044
Fuck you!
I bet you don't have children.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.627
If you want answers, ask us.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.054
Don't bring politicians into it.

21:08.017 --> 21:11.226
They don't want to know
what really happens in a war,

21:11.395 --> 21:15.855
and if you tell them,
they'll hate you for it.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.642
You know what war is, they don't.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.982
Dirty laundry shouldn't be aired
in public, right?

21:23.407 --> 21:25.648
You were one of us, Bosco.

21:27.244 --> 21:31.238
Do you really want to disgrace
your family in front of everyone?

22:04.031 --> 22:07.023
I'd only gone to ask
if she wanted some tea.

22:07.243 --> 22:11.407
They were having sex in broad daylight,
with the door wide open.

22:11.622 --> 22:12.657
My mum...

22:14.375 --> 22:16.412
said it was natural.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.370
That there was nothing
to be ashamed of.

22:23.926 --> 22:26.543
His ass... his skinny ass,

22:28.848 --> 22:31.215
moved up and down.

22:31.392 --> 22:33.804
My mother's face...

22:35.020 --> 22:38.229
It looked like she was shouting
even though she was quiet.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.229
At a certain point,
he opened his eyes...

22:42.903 --> 22:44.735
and saw me.

22:45.823 --> 22:47.985
My mother didn't even notice me.

22:48.826 --> 22:50.612
He smiled at me,

22:50.828 --> 22:53.320
he kept screwing her
and smiling at me.

22:54.623 --> 22:56.830
I ran away.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.628
I was always competing with her.

23:03.674 --> 23:06.257
So I wanted to see if he...

23:07.386 --> 23:10.845
if that look of desire
had been real.

23:12.850 --> 23:15.933
So I started messing around with him,

23:16.103 --> 23:18.390
one day when my mum was out.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.856
I hadn't imagined it.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.645
He really did desire me.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.618
I was 13, shit.

23:35.623 --> 23:38.490
You were brilliant, Veronica.

23:49.720 --> 23:54.635
A friend of mine has written
a very courageous, real piece

23:54.934 --> 23:56.845
and wants to bring it to theatre.

23:57.853 --> 24:00.390
Would you like to audition for it?

24:10.157 --> 24:12.023
Are you going out?

24:13.661 --> 24:15.823
Angelica's taking me to a party.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.779
Hey!

24:18.457 --> 24:20.619
No lipstick.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.037
You look like a mini Jessica Rabbit.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.501
Confiscated.

24:35.057 --> 24:36.673
Where did you meet Amanda?

24:37.685 --> 24:39.392
She's an old client of mine.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.387
She owns Lombardy's
biggest textile conglomerate.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.389
She's had some work done.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.227
Getting old is horrible.

25:18.767 --> 25:22.135
I saw a guy wearing
a vest and flip-flops.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.730
- You'll be seeing more of them...
- What can we do?

25:25.816 --> 25:28.399
Shopkeepers have yachts now!

25:34.366 --> 25:36.198
Leo Notte!

25:38.078 --> 25:40.319
- Cool, how are you?
- Looking good.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.080
As always! Hi, how are you?

25:43.333 --> 25:46.121
I'm having a party on Friday.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.665
Loads of babes, will you come?

25:48.881 --> 25:51.088
- If I'm in the area.
- Come!

25:51.675 --> 25:53.837
Don't forget! Bye.

25:58.891 --> 26:04.386
Zeno Mainaghi, talking of
the decadence of the Costa Smeralda.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.185
Right.

26:12.237 --> 26:15.400
You don't need to feel obliged.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.818
You can be my guest all the same.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.622
I remember you being a smart woman.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.419
Turn it on...

26:39.848 --> 26:42.010
Do you also remember...

26:43.393 --> 26:45.384
how beautiful I was?

26:46.105 --> 26:47.891
You're still beautiful.

26:49.024 --> 26:53.643
You're smart, witty, good in bed,
that's what makes you beautiful.

26:53.821 --> 26:56.358
- You're right!
- Turn it on.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.573
I will.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.370
Are you still friends with Berlusconi?

27:12.631 --> 27:15.373
I've not been in touch
with him for a while.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.209
I'd like to meet him.

27:19.138 --> 27:24.224
Your friend, Zeno Mainaghi,
is his neighbor. Did you know?

27:24.601 --> 27:29.391
If I were you, I'd go to that party.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.895
Give me the cigarette.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.938
Want a smoke?

28:13.233 --> 28:15.474
That stuff stinks of shit.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.455
Basketball?

28:33.879 --> 28:35.620
Rugby-

28:36.632 --> 28:39.090
What's up, are you a faggot?

28:41.261 --> 28:43.844
Did you come with Veronica?

28:45.349 --> 28:48.842
- What do you do in Rome, Mr Rugby?
- I'm a politician.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.849
No way! Wait!

28:53.857 --> 28:55.393
Northern League.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.229
I don't believe it,
did I guess right?

29:01.865 --> 29:06.234
No! You're the first Northern League
member I've met, can I touch you?

29:08.956 --> 29:13.166
Doesn't Veronica mind
being with an ignorant racist?

29:15.212 --> 29:17.374
You promised her a house up north?

29:19.424 --> 29:21.916
I was interested in her,
but I didn't realize

29:22.010 --> 29:25.503
she screws politicians
to further her career.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.305
That's right, I remember!

29:34.731 --> 29:36.438
Say again?

29:37.901 --> 29:39.892
Stop! Shit, are you nuts?

29:40.112 --> 29:42.649
- What's the matter?
- Pietro, stop!

29:43.115 --> 29:44.276
Enough, Pietro!

29:44.408 --> 29:46.820
- Lock that fascist up.
- What did you say?

29:47.035 --> 29:48.446
Get lost, enough!

29:49.288 --> 29:52.280
- Pieces of shit.
- Pietro, get lost.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.414
What are you staring at?

29:57.629 --> 30:00.246
Pieces of shit!

30:06.888 --> 30:08.595
Where the hell are you going?

30:09.725 --> 30:13.434
- I hate people like that.
- So you beat them up?

30:13.645 --> 30:17.354
- Is this how you help me?
- That faggot called you a slut!

30:21.695 --> 30:24.437
Fuck it! Damn it.

30:25.449 --> 30:27.816
- Shit head.
- You did that for me?

30:28.076 --> 30:30.192
Are you coming or not?

30:34.082 --> 30:36.244
Tell me you did it for me.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.539
I did it for you.

30:48.889 --> 30:51.301
I didn't want to hit him, shit.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.763
I didn't find anything
about the blood.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.228
I've been searching documents
for days.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.356
They'll have destroyed them.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.108
What are these?

31:49.199 --> 31:52.066
Documents about
administrative stuff.

31:52.452 --> 31:55.615
Bank payments, statements, invoices...

31:55.831 --> 31:58.243
- Can you leave them with me?
- Yes.

31:58.625 --> 32:03.415
Maybe you'll find proof that
what you said about my dad is true.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.167
So I'll have something to say
at that interview.

32:12.055 --> 32:14.046
Do you trust me?

32:16.226 --> 32:18.888
I told you I'm brave.

32:35.162 --> 32:37.369
A white hair on your chest.

32:42.043 --> 32:44.410
Getting old is horrible, right?

33:09.196 --> 33:10.937
What's so funny?

33:11.406 --> 33:15.024
I made a bet with Martina,
she said I don't have the guts.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.235
To do what?

34:08.255 --> 34:09.541
It happens to me too.

34:09.755 --> 34:14.000
I order a dish, then when I see it,
I'm no longer sure.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.467
<i>- Luca?
- I think I found what we're after.</i>

34:23.853 --> 34:26.641
<i>- Luca Pastore?
- Bibi?</i>

34:26.856 --> 34:28.722
Hold on, I'll call you back.

34:32.027 --> 34:33.985
How did you know?

34:34.947 --> 34:37.440
Partners shouldn't keep secrets
from each other.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.867
How rude,
I haven't introduced myself.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.032
Luigi Brancato.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.627
Don't worry,
I didn't expect you to know my name.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.831
We... like keeping a low profile.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.632
What do you mean by "we"?

34:59.264 --> 35:02.632
I think we need to break the myth
of certain cliches.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.432
I don't have much in common
with my father either.

35:07.647 --> 35:12.016
That's why when they mentioned you
I was sure we'd get along.

35:15.822 --> 35:20.111
But based on who you hang around with,
I'm not so sure.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.657
May I?

35:26.082 --> 35:27.868
I asked myself...

35:28.084 --> 35:31.247
Why is she sleeping with someone
who works for the prosecutor?

35:32.255 --> 35:34.667
She's either very smart...

35:36.343 --> 35:38.630
or very stupid.

35:49.939 --> 35:54.024
Now that we're doing business,
don't let me down, Bibi.

35:54.611 --> 35:58.980
Don't make me resort to old methods
that I frankly don't approve of.

36:01.451 --> 36:03.613
Did you order meat?

36:04.621 --> 36:06.658
- Carpaccio.
- Good.

36:18.802 --> 36:21.419
Who the hell is Luigi Brancato?

36:22.180 --> 36:26.265
He's a businessman, he helped us out
during a difficult period.

36:26.851 --> 36:30.060
So you and my father
messed around with the mafia?

36:36.236 --> 36:39.024
- Did they kill him?
- No.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.815
I don't know, Bibi.

36:43.451 --> 36:47.820
What could we do? Close shop
and fire hundreds of people?

36:48.248 --> 36:52.617
I don't want any part of this,
keep me out of it, okay?

36:52.836 --> 36:55.828
Then what? Will you testify?

36:56.047 --> 37:00.257
Will you change identity or move away?
That's what you'll have to do.

37:00.427 --> 37:03.340
Who'll be the first to pay?
Your mother, your brother...

37:03.430 --> 37:07.094
- Are you threatening me?
- Are you stupid?

37:07.475 --> 37:09.307
I'm not the one threatening you.

37:09.561 --> 37:13.145
Do you realize who the hell
we're dealing with?

37:13.231 --> 37:16.394
I don't give a shit, I'll talk!

37:16.693 --> 37:18.650
I'm not scared.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.748
Leo!

37:41.968 --> 37:43.629
- My friend, welcome.
- Thanks.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.386
This is Assia...

37:46.681 --> 37:49.048
- And Teresa.
- Hi, I'm Leonardo.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.890
Leo.

37:51.227 --> 37:55.061
Keep Leo company,
you come with me. Have fun!

37:55.273 --> 37:58.015
- Isn't your neighbor coming?
- Berlusconi?

37:58.234 --> 38:00.225
Who knows!

38:03.823 --> 38:07.657
- Shall we have a drink?
- Yes, I'd like that.

38:11.414 --> 38:13.121
Excuse me.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.917
Angelica?

38:17.712 --> 38:19.077
Is Viola here?

38:19.756 --> 38:23.624
Relax, I drove her home
a while ago.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.643
You shouldn't smoke like this.

38:40.443 --> 38:44.152
- Are you my mother?
- No. Inhale!

38:45.740 --> 38:47.230
That's the point of it.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.822
Do you want to make another bet?

38:55.708 --> 38:57.244
Try me.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.747
I'll guess what star sign you are.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.579
If you win?

39:02.549 --> 39:04.631
I'll kiss you.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.255
What if I win?

39:08.137 --> 39:10.048
You'll kiss me.

39:10.932 --> 39:13.594
A so-called "win-win agreement".

39:15.854 --> 39:16.935
Aquarius.

39:19.607 --> 39:20.847
23.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.399
January? I guessed!

39:25.822 --> 39:28.234
The age difference between us.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.951
Shame you're such a moralist.

39:36.583 --> 39:40.247
Shame... you're so under-age.

39:41.838 --> 39:45.422
By the way, I'm not 15, I'm 19.

39:46.050 --> 39:50.009
My mom lies about my age
not to feel so old.

39:53.141 --> 39:56.224
Why deny yourself
something you desire?

40:21.461 --> 40:23.077
Are you a good girl?

40:23.838 --> 40:26.045
I'm good at everything.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.423
I want to screw like a man.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.839
I want to do the thrusting
instead of being thrust into.

40:36.059 --> 40:39.427
I want to be the one seizing
instead of being seized.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.398
All right, thanks. Next.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.661
Next!

41:12.720 --> 41:16.179
- Name?
- Veronica Castello.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.598
When you're ready, Veronica.

41:30.029 --> 41:32.191
When you're ready.

41:49.716 --> 41:53.630
Don't be upset, come on!
You'll get another chance, right?

42:04.731 --> 42:06.813
Is that your mother?

42:09.527 --> 42:13.020
- She looks like you.
- No, that's not true.

42:13.239 --> 42:16.072
Look, that's me.

42:18.119 --> 42:19.905
Viola?

42:20.371 --> 42:23.238
I slept over at the villa
where the party was.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.870
Get our swimsuits and come join me.

42:28.838 --> 42:32.627
Come on, she goes to your school,
it's her birthday party.

42:32.842 --> 42:34.628
Of course, you met her by chance...

42:34.844 --> 42:38.212
She lives near here.
Come on, you'll have fun.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.428
Dad, she's 8 years old.

42:42.643 --> 42:46.352
And you're nearly 14,
you'll be able to drive a moped soon.

42:46.606 --> 42:49.724
Is this why we came to Sardinia?

42:49.901 --> 42:52.643
A brand new, shiny, dark blue one.

42:57.992 --> 43:02.031
Red, and 300,000 liras
pocket money a month.

43:05.208 --> 43:06.664
A chip off the old block.

43:28.231 --> 43:31.223
You realize I'll be surrounded
by little girls...

43:31.442 --> 43:35.436
I'd rather you hang out
with a girl who's 8, not 19.

43:35.655 --> 43:38.568
- Who do you mean?
- Angelica.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.357
But she's 15!

43:40.660 --> 43:43.994
- She's 19, she told me.
- No, I'm sure.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.656
She'll be in the second year
of high school.

44:02.223 --> 44:04.715
<i>- Hello?
- What happened to you?</i>

44:05.017 --> 44:07.224
My friend said
you postponed the interview.

44:07.311 --> 44:08.301
<i>Yes, sorry,</i>

44:08.396 --> 44:10.933
I needed to think about what to say.

44:11.691 --> 44:13.273
You've changed your mind.

44:14.152 --> 44:17.110
No, but it's not easy.

44:19.031 --> 44:22.023
- Is something wrong?
- N0 .

44:22.451 --> 44:25.068
<i>Did you find anything
in those documents?</i>

44:25.371 --> 44:26.657
Maybe.

44:27.039 --> 44:31.454
<i>Your father was using
a Swiss bank account to pay bribes.</i>

44:31.836 --> 44:35.079
<i>- What about the blood?
- Maybe he used the same account</i>

44:35.214 --> 44:38.582
to buy the blood
without leaving any trace.

44:38.801 --> 44:40.712
Problem is, it's a blind account.

44:41.554 --> 44:43.170
<i>I need time.</i>

44:43.264 --> 44:48.179
I need the documents back,
someone might notice they're gone.

44:49.645 --> 44:50.680
<i>Luca!</i>

44:50.897 --> 44:54.515
<i>- I need the documents back, okay?
- Luca?</i>

44:54.734 --> 44:57.317
<i>- What's up?
- Luca, did you hear me?</i>

44:58.779 --> 45:00.065
I'll call you back.

45:00.156 --> 45:02.318
<i>Four victims confirmed.</i>

45:02.408 --> 45:05.867
<i>This news came in just before
the special bulletin.</i>

45:06.078 --> 45:10.493
<i>The news has yet to be confirmed
but out of duty we must report it,</i>

45:10.708 --> 45:12.415
<i>obviously for now
we are only presuming</i>

45:12.460 --> 45:13.450
JULY 19th

45:13.502 --> 45:17.837
<i>that the judge involved
in this bomb attack is Borsellino</i>

45:18.049 --> 45:22.464
<i>and the attack
was in actual fact a car bomb</i>

45:22.678 --> 45:28.014
<i>which exploded, it seems,
near the judge's mother's house.</i>

45:28.184 --> 45:30.846
<i>Most likely,
but this needs to be confirmed,</i>

45:31.020 --> 45:33.637
<i>Borsellino was going
to visit his mother,</i>

45:33.856 --> 45:38.646
<i>as the location of the attack
is where the judge's mother lives.</i>

45:38.819 --> 45:41.436
- <i>A judge who was very close...</i>
- Shit!

45:41.656 --> 45:44.899
<i>...to Judge Falcone,
that's why we're re-experiencing</i>

45:45.117 --> 45:48.235
<i>this terrible, difficult,
anguished atmosphere</i>

45:48.454 --> 45:51.822
<i>which began when
the first reports arrived</i>

45:52.041 --> 45:55.204
<i>regarding the news of the attack
on Judge Falcone.</i>

45:55.544 --> 45:58.252
<i>Yes, we are receiving more details</i>

45:58.422 --> 46:01.210
<i>from colleagues
who are updating me...</i>

46:16.482 --> 46:19.850
<i>JULY 28th</i>

46:22.947 --> 46:25.359
Do you realize that
they even made me pay?

46:33.916 --> 46:36.624
Unbelievable! Those jerks!

46:37.628 --> 46:39.039
Bortolotti!

46:41.090 --> 46:45.175
Who knew you were a beach-goer.
Why are you here?

46:45.386 --> 46:48.219
- Why? Isn't it allowed?
- No, of course it is.

46:50.641 --> 46:53.679
Listen, I don't think
I've ever thanked you.

46:53.769 --> 46:57.637
- For what?
- For everything.

46:58.441 --> 47:01.274
I've become an MP.

47:02.445 --> 47:05.733
If it hadn't been for you,
who knows where the hell I'd be.

47:07.283 --> 47:09.240
You're in good shape!

47:09.452 --> 47:11.409
Maybe you're a bit burnt...

47:11.620 --> 47:15.454
- I didn't put cream on, I'm all burnt.
- I can see.

47:15.624 --> 47:17.615
Well...

47:18.461 --> 47:21.624
I'll go back to my girl,
look how hot she is!

47:23.841 --> 47:26.629
I bring her here,
so no one will bother her.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.255
They're all queers.

47:29.055 --> 47:30.341
Here?

47:31.891 --> 47:33.677
See you in Parliament.

47:33.893 --> 47:36.385
Shit. I got you!

47:36.604 --> 47:38.436
- Bye.
- Bye, Bortolotti!

47:38.856 --> 47:40.597
Bye. bye.

47:44.153 --> 47:47.111
Well, shall we go for a dip?

47:53.371 --> 47:55.578
Well? Sorry...

48:00.086 --> 48:02.828
Listen, I was thinking...

48:05.716 --> 48:07.957
why don't we get married?

48:09.428 --> 48:11.214
Not now.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.380
When you're ready.

48:15.267 --> 48:17.474
I thought we had a deal?

48:19.688 --> 48:21.850
I've kept my part of the deal.

48:23.859 --> 48:25.816
Now it's your turn.

48:29.448 --> 48:31.655
Find me a job on TV.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.820
I'm going for a swim.

48:42.628 --> 48:45.040
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

48:45.923 --> 48:47.914
Bibi, it's me.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.416
Where the heck are you?

48:50.636 --> 48:54.220
I've been looking for you for days,
I've been to your house

48:54.432 --> 48:56.514
but you're not answering the door.

48:56.642 --> 48:59.760
I've been to your parents' house,
but they don't know anything,

48:59.854 --> 49:01.390
where the hell are you?

49:01.981 --> 49:04.814
I'm worried. Call me.

49:16.537 --> 49:17.777
- Hey!
- Hey!

49:18.038 --> 49:20.826
You could've told me
it wasn't an exclusive story.

49:21.041 --> 49:23.749
- What do you mean?
- Mainaghi's daughter.

49:23.836 --> 49:26.828
After postponing thirty times,
today she cancelled her interview.

49:26.922 --> 49:29.254
Did you speak to her today?
What did she say?

49:29.425 --> 49:32.042
- She's doing a press conference.
- When?

49:32.219 --> 49:35.928
- Don't you know about it?
- When is the conference?

49:36.515 --> 49:39.598
Do you think your father's death
weighs on the judges' conscience?

49:39.685 --> 49:42.928
How does it feel to be in charge
of such an important company?

49:43.022 --> 49:45.730
How will the company change
under your management?

49:45.858 --> 49:48.099
Please, just a moment,

49:48.194 --> 49:51.232
Miss Mainaghi is about to make
a detailed announcement

49:51.447 --> 49:54.656
in relation to all your questions,
thank you.

49:56.243 --> 49:58.610
When I took my father's place...

49:59.747 --> 50:02.865
I decided I would change
the name of the Mainaghi group.

50:03.167 --> 50:05.454
I wanted to start afresh,

50:05.628 --> 50:09.246
give a clear message of change.

50:10.257 --> 50:15.423
But then I realized I'd only be doing it
to win over the public.

50:17.348 --> 50:21.307
My father paid too high a price
for his mistakes.

50:21.685 --> 50:25.644
And it's for this reason
that the group...

50:27.274 --> 50:29.060
will keep his name.

50:30.945 --> 50:33.937
Because Michele Mainaghi
was a great man,

50:34.281 --> 50:37.865
targeted by politicized judges

50:38.869 --> 50:42.612
who use unscrupulous
and violent methods.

50:45.376 --> 50:47.287
My father was a martyr.

50:48.462 --> 50:52.046
- What do you mean by "martyr"?
- Which "politicized judges"?

50:54.218 --> 50:55.708
Thank you.

50:57.054 --> 51:00.137
Please. Please!

51:22.413 --> 51:24.450
- Did you sleep with her?
- What?

51:25.249 --> 51:27.707
Did you sleep with Amanda?

51:28.460 --> 51:30.622
I thought you liked them young.

51:30.838 --> 51:34.251
I care about her,
I'm making her happy.

51:34.425 --> 51:37.417
It's nice giving people
what they want.

51:37.636 --> 51:39.218
Fresh meat?

51:39.430 --> 51:42.263
After your twenties life is just
a preparation for death.

51:42.474 --> 51:44.056
Nice thought!

51:44.226 --> 51:47.218
So try to give and receive
as much pleasure as possible.

51:47.438 --> 51:50.476
My friends' fathers don't say
these kind of things.

51:50.649 --> 51:54.438
I think your friends' fathers
don't have a goddamn clue.

52:02.620 --> 52:05.783
Here, a present for Barbara.

52:07.625 --> 52:09.457
Have fun.

52:09.627 --> 52:12.244
Right, it'll be a ball.

52:17.092 --> 52:18.503
Viola!

53:30.999 --> 53:32.865
Come to daddy.

53:33.210 --> 53:35.793
So, I have a joke to tell you.

53:36.839 --> 53:38.250
Sit down.

53:38.424 --> 53:42.509
Berlusconi suddenly walks into a room,
his wife jumps up and shouts:

53:42.720 --> 53:46.839
"Oh God!", and he says:
"Relax, just call me Silvio".

53:50.853 --> 53:53.220
Was I good?

53:54.940 --> 53:57.102
Shall I tell you another one?

53:58.652 --> 54:00.643
Good evening, sir.

54:01.155 --> 54:03.943
- I'm Viola's father.
- Ah, good evening.

54:11.749 --> 54:15.708
NEXT TIME

54:51.872 --> 54:54.159
I've missed you.
