Joe can't know what
I'm about to tell you.

00:06.661 --> 00:09.830
I'm pretty
sick, Allison.

00:09.897 --> 00:11.398
My odds are 60%.

00:11.465 --> 00:15.602
I was having a dream
about you.

00:15.670 --> 00:17.103
We were,

00:17.171 --> 00:19.539
we were in your living room
in Grosse Pointe.

00:19.607 --> 00:22.843
It was, uh, it was
Ariel, Bridgette, Marie.

00:22.910 --> 00:25.579
And-And Bridgette had just

00:25.646 --> 00:27.480
graduated
from college.

00:28.583 --> 00:29.783
You did a good thing.

00:29.851 --> 00:31.618
Even though I lied.

00:31.686 --> 00:34.354
Ah, don't worry about it.

Morning, Bob.

00:46.033 --> 00:46.967
Morning, Tom.

00:47.034 --> 00:48.001
Ready to
get to work?

00:48.069 --> 00:48.985
You betcha.

00:49.070 --> 00:52.772
Let's go for
day number 24,838.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.041
Cool offices!

00:55.109 --> 00:58.111
What are you guys
working on in here?

00:58.179 --> 00:59.829
Look, I don't know
who let you in,

00:59.914 --> 01:01.648
but it's not cool
for you to be here.

01:01.716 --> 01:03.550
Now, I'm gonna let you
off with a warning,

01:03.618 --> 01:07.053
but the next time I look up,
you best be gone.

01:08.689 --> 01:10.724
Nice light.

01:10.791 --> 01:13.793
How often you guys have
to change the bulbs in here?

01:13.861 --> 01:15.428
What is the matter
with you two?

01:15.479 --> 01:17.564
Did you not
hear my friend?

01:17.632 --> 01:19.766
Hit the road.

01:21.502 --> 01:24.571
So what are you guys
getting all upset about?

01:24.638 --> 01:26.039
We're just new
to the neighborhood,

01:26.107 --> 01:27.324
wanted to say "hey."

01:27.408 --> 01:28.642
New to the
neighborhood?

01:28.709 --> 01:29.910
This isn't your
neighborhood.

01:29.977 --> 01:31.494
You're not even
supposed to be here.

01:31.579 --> 01:32.746
Why not?

01:35.166 --> 01:37.217
This is bad.

01:37.285 --> 01:38.484
We should call Central.

01:38.536 --> 01:39.486
On it.

01:39.553 --> 01:40.987
You're calling Central?

01:41.038 --> 01:42.372
Awesome!

01:42.456 --> 01:44.624
Hey, you think they'd call out
and get us some pizzas?

01:44.675 --> 01:46.059
Oh, my God.

01:46.127 --> 01:48.011
They're multiplying
really fast.

01:48.095 --> 01:49.346
Pizza?

01:49.430 --> 01:51.765
Anybody interested in
some pineapple on top?

01:51.832 --> 01:52.966
It's just ringing
and ringing.

01:53.017 --> 01:54.100
Nobody's picking up.

01:54.168 --> 01:55.602
Can I see a show of hands?

01:55.669 --> 01:56.770
How many for pineapple?

02:00.441 --> 02:01.975
Get out.

02:02.026 --> 02:03.059
Get out!

02:03.144 --> 02:04.844
You're not supposed
to be here!

02:04.895 --> 02:07.314
None of you are
supposed to be here!

02:07.365 --> 02:08.648
Get out!

02:08.716 --> 02:11.584
None of you are
supposed to be here!

02:11.652 --> 02:13.887
Leave us alone,
all of you!

02:13.955 --> 02:16.356
Get out!

02:16.407 --> 02:18.291
I'm truly sorry, Marjorie.

02:20.044 --> 02:24.247
We had no idea things had gotten
this bad this quickly.

02:24.332 --> 02:27.133
I know this isn't the diagnosis
you were hoping for,

02:27.201 --> 02:30.070
the diagnosis you expected.

02:30.137 --> 02:33.073
If you have any questions
or if you just need time

02:33.140 --> 02:35.709
to think about everything
you've been told...

02:37.712 --> 02:39.813
No.

02:39.880 --> 02:43.183
I'm fine.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.851
Really.

02:44.919 --> 02:47.754
Are you sure?

02:47.822 --> 02:50.357
Absolutely.

02:59.367 --> 03:02.335
Mom?

03:02.403 --> 03:04.070
It's not even 7:00 here.

03:04.138 --> 03:06.406
You all right?

03:06.457 --> 03:08.458

You know what she's

04:08.602 --> 04:11.771
She's telling him not to worry.

04:11.839 --> 04:14.674
She's saying it's no big deal,
just a few tests.

04:30.958 --> 04:33.927
Why?

04:37.798 --> 04:41.334
I know what you know.

I know that she's sick,
I know it's not good.

But beyond that,
I... I can't see too much.

04:49.209 --> 04:50.577
I'm too close to her.

04:50.644 --> 04:52.145
You know how that stuff works.

04:54.548 --> 04:58.084
Today... Ally.

04:58.152 --> 04:59.352
Tell him.

05:05.593 --> 05:07.510
My mom's in the hospital.

05:07.595 --> 05:08.528
It's no big deal.

05:08.596 --> 05:09.879
It's just some tests.

05:09.964 --> 05:12.365
She was afraid I might call
the house and not get her

05:12.433 --> 05:14.000
and didn't want me
to be alarmed, so...

05:14.068 --> 05:15.401
I want you to pack a bag.

05:15.469 --> 05:16.769
I want you to go out there.

05:16.837 --> 05:18.705
What are you talking about?

05:18.772 --> 05:19.872
Do you know something?

05:19.940 --> 05:21.975
I don't know anything.

05:22.042 --> 05:24.410
I just know
you need to pack a bag.

05:24.478 --> 05:26.346
You need to get on a plane.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.880
<i>I don't get it.</i>

05:27.948 --> 05:31.784
If Grandma's not really sick,
then why is Daddy going there?

05:31.852 --> 05:34.070
Well, Daddy's just
worried about her.

05:34.154 --> 05:36.122
And sometimes when people
are in the hospital,

05:36.190 --> 05:37.657
it's good to have
somebody around.

05:37.725 --> 05:42.295
Okay, I'm on a flight
in two and a half hours.

05:42.362 --> 05:45.131
Don't even ask
what the ticket cost.

05:45.198 --> 05:46.699
When will you be back?

05:46.767 --> 05:47.800
I don't know, honey.

05:47.868 --> 05:49.035
Maybe tomorrow.

05:49.103 --> 05:50.937
Maybe the next day;
I can't be sure.

05:51.005 --> 05:52.372
That's what I'm
hoping, anyway.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.307
Will you give Grandma
a kiss for me?

05:54.375 --> 05:55.975
Yes.

05:56.043 --> 05:56.976
Oh.

05:57.044 --> 05:57.977
Me, too.

05:58.045 --> 05:59.178
Mm.

05:59.246 --> 06:01.047
Me, too.
Mm.

06:01.098 --> 06:03.099
Hey.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.553
Call me when you land.

06:07.604 --> 06:09.355
Okay.

06:11.425 --> 06:13.593
Thanks for coming.

06:13.661 --> 06:15.361
We got ourselves
a head-scratcher here.

06:15.412 --> 06:16.496
How you doing?
You okay?

06:16.563 --> 06:18.031
Yeah. No.

06:18.098 --> 06:19.732
Joe's mom is
not well.

06:19.783 --> 06:22.585
He's taking off for Michigan
probably right about now.

06:22.670 --> 06:23.903
Anything I can do?

06:23.954 --> 06:25.038
No, no, thanks.

06:25.105 --> 06:28.241
So what do we
have here?

06:28.308 --> 06:29.776
Fell on the tracks
just as the train

06:29.843 --> 06:30.810
was pulling into
the station.

06:30.878 --> 06:32.244
May have jumped, may
have been pushed.

06:32.296 --> 06:33.245
We just don't know.

06:33.297 --> 06:34.847
Pushed?

06:34.915 --> 06:37.116
Apparently, some homeless guy
was, uh, begging for change

06:37.184 --> 06:38.685
on the platform this morning.

06:38.752 --> 06:41.721
Couple people reported that he
was standing near this fellow.

06:41.789 --> 06:44.223
For the moment, he seems
to have disappeared.

06:44.291 --> 06:46.592
Security cameras didn't
catch much of him either.

06:46.660 --> 06:49.162
Of course, everyone's
all over the place on, uh,

06:49.229 --> 06:52.932
how tall the guy is, color of
his hair, stocky, slight.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.534
The only thing
everyone can agree on

06:54.601 --> 06:56.869
is that apparently the guy stunk
to holy hell.

06:56.937 --> 06:58.738
Body odor, urine.

06:58.806 --> 07:00.273
Guess he had it
all going on.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.241
But since we can't

07:02.309 --> 07:03.943
put an APB out
on a stench

07:03.994 --> 07:06.012
and since we don't even
know who the guy is...

07:06.080 --> 07:07.663
What do you mean?
We know where he works

07:07.748 --> 07:09.015
and we know
that his name's Adam.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.817
What do you mean?
H-How do we know

07:10.884 --> 07:12.585
where he works
and that his name's Adam?

07:12.653 --> 07:13.886
Well, he's wearing...

07:16.023 --> 07:18.624
It was just there.

07:18.692 --> 07:21.794
When I was looking a second ago,
it said, "Burger Palace.

07:21.862 --> 07:24.664
Hello, my name is Adam."

07:24.732 --> 07:27.483
Okay.

07:27.568 --> 07:28.968
But, uh, he's
wearing a nice suit.

07:29.019 --> 07:31.471
Doesn't look like the kind
of thing a guy who works, uh,

07:31.538 --> 07:33.272
Burger Palace flipping
burgers would wear.

07:33.323 --> 07:36.275
I don't know what to tell you,
I just know what I saw.

07:36.343 --> 07:40.246
Maybe he's a district manager,
or maybe he owns the franchise.

07:40.314 --> 07:43.649
Okay, I'll, uh,
I'll check it out.

07:46.987 --> 07:48.788
MAN Michael Crawford,
340. Michael Crawford...

07:48.856 --> 07:50.256
Mom?

07:50.323 --> 07:51.824
Hello?

07:57.998 --> 08:00.933
WOMAN Paging Dr.
Stateman. Dr. Stateman, please.

08:09.977 --> 08:12.445
I told you not to come.

08:12.513 --> 08:14.847
MAN Michael Crawford,
please call 340.

08:14.915 --> 08:17.450
Well, what are you
looking at me like that for?

08:17.518 --> 08:19.018
Is it the IV?

08:19.086 --> 08:21.788
'Cause I'll tell you,
it's all the rage around here.

08:21.855 --> 08:24.290
I just took a lap
to show mine off.

08:24.358 --> 08:25.858
Mom.

08:25.926 --> 08:27.994
It's not that serious,
sweetheart.

08:28.061 --> 08:29.695
Come give your mother a hug.

08:35.001 --> 08:36.702
You said you were here
for headaches.

08:36.753 --> 08:37.886
And I am.

08:37.971 --> 08:41.924
I get headaches,
I-I'm feeling a bit weak...

08:42.009 --> 08:46.095
and my appetite
seems to be gone.

08:46.180 --> 08:49.315
Although I'm sure that's
all about the headaches.

08:50.918 --> 08:52.852
What do the
doctors say?

08:52.920 --> 08:56.355
Oh, the doctors say
they're going to run tests.

08:56.406 --> 08:59.192
And they have, and they are.

09:04.598 --> 09:05.698
I like your haircut.

09:05.766 --> 09:07.633
It's very smart.

09:11.638 --> 09:12.772
Oh, now, while...

09:12.840 --> 09:16.843
while I'm thinking
about it, um... um...

09:23.183 --> 09:25.351
The keys to my house.

09:25.419 --> 09:27.019
Hmm?

09:27.087 --> 09:29.255
You're gonna have to
take a taxi there,

09:29.323 --> 09:32.592
but then you can use my car.

09:36.930 --> 09:37.864
What?

09:37.931 --> 09:39.999
Why are you
looking at me like that?

09:40.067 --> 09:41.934
Sorry, I'm worried about you.

09:42.002 --> 09:43.202
You don't look well.

09:43.270 --> 09:45.905
Well, don't be.

09:47.774 --> 09:50.509
I'm sure this is nothing.

09:50.577 --> 09:52.211
I'm sure it'll pass.

09:52.279 --> 09:55.214
Now, you go back
to the house,

09:55.282 --> 09:57.116
get settled, call your wife

09:57.167 --> 09:59.285
and tell her you arrived
safe and sound.

09:59.353 --> 10:01.220
Mom, I came here to be with you.

10:01.288 --> 10:03.456
Well, that's very nice,
sweetheart.

10:03.523 --> 10:04.857
I appreciate that, I do.

10:04.925 --> 10:09.462
But... right now,
I could really use a little nap.

10:10.597 --> 10:14.533
So go to the house, unpack.

10:14.601 --> 10:15.902
Come back for dinner.

10:15.969 --> 10:17.970
I'll share my Jell-O with you.

10:23.377 --> 10:26.312
It's okay, Joe.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.781
Listen to your mother.

10:35.155 --> 10:37.256
Uh, excuse me.

10:37.324 --> 10:39.375
Are you Dr. Chapman?

10:39.459 --> 10:41.227
My name is Joe Dubois.

10:41.295 --> 10:43.129
You're treating
my mother, Marjorie.

10:43.196 --> 10:44.964
Nice to meet you.

10:45.032 --> 10:46.465
Lovely woman,
your mother.

10:46.516 --> 10:49.235
Uh, so-so she said that
you were running some tests.

10:49.303 --> 10:51.504
I was wondering when we might
actually see the results.

10:51.571 --> 10:52.705
Tests?

10:52.773 --> 10:54.106
For her headaches.

10:54.174 --> 10:56.742
She said that you were
trying to determine the cause.

10:58.779 --> 11:00.713
Is there something wrong?

11:00.781 --> 11:04.183
I'm sorry, it's just...

11:04.234 --> 11:05.851
I'm afraid your
mother is not

11:05.919 --> 11:08.371
being entirely
forthcoming with you.

11:08.455 --> 11:10.323
The truth is, we
ran tests on her

11:10.390 --> 11:12.058
the day she checked
herself in here.

11:12.125 --> 11:16.062
We diagnosed her condition
within a matter of hours.

11:16.129 --> 11:18.664
She has an astrocytoma
in her frontal lobe.

11:20.367 --> 11:22.068
Brain cancer.

11:24.137 --> 11:26.339
As I'm sure you've noticed,

11:26.406 --> 11:28.741
your mother's attitude
is quite remarkable.

11:28.809 --> 11:31.210
She doesn't want anybody
to worry about her.

11:31.278 --> 11:33.045
Not even her doctor.

11:34.014 --> 11:36.265
Okay.

11:36.350 --> 11:38.217
So... what's the treatment?

11:38.285 --> 11:40.219
Are we looking at surgery?

11:40.287 --> 11:41.887
I'm afraid we're
past that, Mr. DuBois.

11:41.955 --> 11:43.556
The cancer's too far along.

11:43.623 --> 11:45.791
It's well beyond the point
where a craniotomy would help.

11:45.859 --> 11:47.960
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

11:48.028 --> 11:50.763
Are-are you saying
it's incurable?

11:50.831 --> 11:52.565
Is my mom gonna die?

11:52.632 --> 11:55.101
There's really no such thing
as an incurable cancer.

11:55.168 --> 11:57.703
People do recover
from stage four illnesses.

11:57.771 --> 12:00.339
It's just...
statistically?

12:00.407 --> 12:04.944
Those kinds of recoveries,
in a patient your mother's age,

12:05.012 --> 12:08.781
they're... well, we call them
outliers. That means...

12:08.849 --> 12:12.585
It means it hardly ever
happens, yeah.

12:12.652 --> 12:15.788
I know what an outlier is.

12:15.856 --> 12:17.523
I'm sorry, Mr. DuBois.

12:17.591 --> 12:20.059
I didn't realize nobody'd
explained the situation to you.

12:21.528 --> 12:23.863
There's some literature
you should read. Studies.

12:23.930 --> 12:26.332
I'll make sure our staff
gets them to you.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.702
You can have a look at
the statistics for yourself.

12:39.546 --> 12:41.747
The guy's name's Adam.
You were right about that.

12:41.798 --> 12:43.449
Adam Tallmadge.

12:43.517 --> 12:45.885
Doesn't work at the
Burger Palace, though;

12:45.952 --> 12:47.753
he's a CPA with
Denison Consulting,

12:47.821 --> 12:50.622
or he was, until his
unfortunate run-in

12:50.674 --> 12:52.725
with the 7:20 express
train this morning.

12:52.793 --> 12:54.627
Apparently, he just
got passed over

12:54.694 --> 12:56.028
for a big promotion at work.

12:56.096 --> 12:58.330
His boss said he didn't
take it too well.

12:58.398 --> 13:00.099
You don't think he jumped in
front of that train, do you?

13:00.167 --> 13:01.567
Well, I think
it's a possibility.

13:01.635 --> 13:04.103
He'd been sending all kinds of
strange emails to his colleagues

13:04.171 --> 13:05.371
in the middle of the night.

13:05.439 --> 13:08.107
But I also think, unless
this homeless guy turns up,

13:08.175 --> 13:09.308
and starts to explain things,

13:09.376 --> 13:11.177
we may never know
what really happened.

13:14.164 --> 13:15.915
Oh, Lee, I gotta
take this. It's Joe.

13:15.982 --> 13:18.384
Yeah, no problem. I just
thought you'd want to know.

13:18.452 --> 13:20.519
Uh, listen, I hope everything's
okay with your mother-in-law.

13:20.587 --> 13:22.822
Hey, Joe.
Is everything all right?

13:22.889 --> 13:25.391
Uh, I don't know, it's...

13:25.459 --> 13:27.860
It's bad, I guess,
it's really bad.

13:27.928 --> 13:29.845
Sweetie, hold on a second.

13:29.930 --> 13:31.931
I'm going to try to
find someplace private.

13:40.140 --> 13:41.574
Hey, what's going on?

13:41.641 --> 13:43.609
She has brain cancer.

13:43.677 --> 13:46.879
My mom has brain cancer.

13:46.947 --> 13:50.082
Oh, Joe. I'm so sorry.

13:50.150 --> 13:53.686
It's not even operable.

13:53.753 --> 13:54.820
Oh, my God.

13:54.888 --> 13:56.622
They're giving her radiation.

13:56.690 --> 14:00.192
They're trying to get her strong
enough so she can... have chemo.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.695
And then if she survives
the chemo, then...

14:02.762 --> 14:05.531
according to the literature
they gave me, she's got maybe...

14:05.599 --> 14:08.434
a year, 18 months, tops.

14:08.502 --> 14:12.571
How is she handling it?
How's her state of mind?

14:12.639 --> 14:15.574
She's in total denial.
She's telling me not to worry,

14:15.642 --> 14:17.042
that everything's
going to be okay.

14:17.110 --> 14:18.911
Maybe that's good.
Maybe that's not a bad thing.

14:18.979 --> 14:21.413
Maybe-maybe she knows
something about herself,

14:21.481 --> 14:23.749
maybe she can sense that she's
going to pull through this.

14:23.817 --> 14:26.152
Honey, it's inoperable.

14:29.489 --> 14:31.790
Honey, is there anything
that you need us to do?

14:31.858 --> 14:33.492
I mean, maybe I should just...

14:33.560 --> 14:36.529
pack the girls up, we should
fly out there tomorrow.

14:36.596 --> 14:39.231
I don't know.

14:39.299 --> 14:41.534
No, I mean...

14:41.601 --> 14:45.437
Maybe next week, when...
they start the chemo.

14:45.505 --> 14:48.607
I'm going to go back
in the room now, okay?

14:48.675 --> 14:51.010
Okay.

14:51.077 --> 14:52.344
Hey, I love you.

14:52.412 --> 14:54.413
I love you, too.

15:00.420 --> 15:02.254
Excuse me, sir.

15:10.096 --> 15:11.697
Yeah, Marcie, it's me.

15:11.764 --> 15:13.199
Tell Trevor I'm going to be late

15:13.266 --> 15:14.950
for the 9:00
staff meeting, okay?

15:17.988 --> 15:19.371
I don't know how late.

15:19.439 --> 15:21.307
It depends on when
the train gets here.

15:31.351 --> 15:33.619
God bless your
heart, ma'am.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.545
Yeah, Marcie, it's me.
Tell Trevor I'm going to be late

15:53.630 --> 15:55.497
for the 9:00 staff
meeting, okay?

15:55.548 --> 15:58.550
I don't know how late. Depends
on when the train gets here.

16:06.643 --> 16:08.844
Hey. Remember, don't be
overanxious.

16:08.912 --> 16:10.913
If you see our friend,
tell me where he is.

16:10.980 --> 16:13.232
We don't want to pick him up
unless and until

16:13.316 --> 16:15.701
he makes a move on that woman,
so we can arrest him.

16:15.785 --> 16:17.402
Everybody copies that.

16:17.487 --> 16:19.922
We're just waiting
on your signal.

16:20.890 --> 16:24.042
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

16:24.127 --> 16:26.061
It's all right, you
haven't missed anything.

16:26.129 --> 16:27.713
What's with the entourage?

16:27.797 --> 16:29.398
Joe's out of town.

16:29.465 --> 16:31.266
I couldn't find anyone
to take them to school.

16:31.334 --> 16:32.568
Okay, remember what I told you:

16:32.635 --> 16:34.703
Bridgette, when you hear the
train come into the station,

16:34.754 --> 16:36.221
you're going to
hold Marie's hand.

16:36.306 --> 16:38.240
You guys'll just
turn around and...

16:38.308 --> 16:41.393
stare at that poster, and...

16:41.477 --> 16:43.912
until I tell you to
turn back around, okay?

16:43.980 --> 16:46.682
Why? What is it
you think we'll see

16:46.749 --> 16:48.483
that we haven't
seen already?

16:48.551 --> 16:49.651
Mom. We have cable.

16:49.719 --> 16:51.887
Yeah.

16:51.955 --> 16:53.956
Girls, please just
do what I ask.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.528
Hey, hey. That's our lady.

16:59.596 --> 17:02.030
Have you seen the man yet?

17:02.081 --> 17:05.534
Ain't seen him,
ain't smelled him.

17:08.037 --> 17:09.621
Okay, girls.
Hold hands, turn around.

17:20.266 --> 17:22.050
Can somebody get me
an update, please?

17:22.117 --> 17:26.421
We're on the woman.
No sign of our guy.

17:39.953 --> 17:42.321
Hey, I can't see anything, guys.
What's going on?

17:42.405 --> 17:45.240
Nobody made a move
on her. She, uh...

17:45.291 --> 17:47.209
she just got on the train.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.482
Looks like she got
a pretty good seat, too.

17:53.549 --> 17:55.684
Still no homeless guy, either.

17:55.752 --> 17:57.085
Can we turn around now?

17:57.136 --> 17:58.953
Yeah. Yeah, you
can turn around.

18:00.757 --> 18:02.424
I don't understand.

18:02.492 --> 18:05.260
It was supposed to be
today, I'm sure of it.

18:05.328 --> 18:07.462
WOMAN
Paging Dr. Bender.

18:09.532 --> 18:11.984
Yep.

18:14.771 --> 18:16.305
You must be Joe.

18:16.372 --> 18:18.357
I'm an attorney, Joe.

18:18.441 --> 18:19.574
Mostly corporate work,

18:19.642 --> 18:22.577
but I did handle your
parents' affairs for them.

18:22.645 --> 18:24.579
Anyway, I need you
to help me with something.

18:24.647 --> 18:26.281
What's that?

18:26.349 --> 18:28.383
Your mother's will.

18:28.451 --> 18:31.186
Or, more accurately,
the lack of one.

18:31.254 --> 18:33.555
You're saying she
has no will?
Oh, no, no, no.

18:33.623 --> 18:35.824
She has a will. It's something
I drew up for her

18:35.892 --> 18:37.259
right after your
parents divorced,

18:37.327 --> 18:38.927
but it hasn't been
amended in years.

18:38.994 --> 18:42.331
Because of that, if
something were to happen,

18:42.398 --> 18:45.067
there'd be a substantial portion
of her estate unaccounted for.

18:45.134 --> 18:46.852
And those assets
could stay locked up

18:46.936 --> 18:48.637
in estate court for years.

18:48.705 --> 18:50.472
Okay. So she'll
amend her will.

18:50.540 --> 18:53.575
Well, that's the thing.
She won't.

18:53.643 --> 18:56.645
She won't even entertain it
as a topic of discussion.

18:56.713 --> 18:59.314
She just keeps insisting
that she's gonna be fine,

18:59.365 --> 19:01.233
she'll take care of it
when she's feeling better.

19:01.300 --> 19:05.353
My mother seems to be having
trouble absorbing her diagnosis.

19:05.405 --> 19:07.956
Uh, okay, no, it's fine.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.224
I-I-I'll talk to her.

19:09.292 --> 19:10.859
I'll get her to attend to this.

19:21.371 --> 19:24.206
Hey, Mom.

19:24.273 --> 19:27.709
How are you feeling?

19:27.777 --> 19:30.212
I'm a little
bit tired, mm-hmm.

19:31.781 --> 19:33.882
Will you drink
something for me?

19:33.950 --> 19:35.517
Hmm. For you?

19:35.585 --> 19:37.569
Mm-hmm.

19:40.690 --> 19:42.457
There you go.

19:49.799 --> 19:51.600
How beautiful.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.435
You didn't have to do that.

19:53.503 --> 19:56.238
Oh, they're not from me.
Sam Diller

19:56.305 --> 19:57.939
came by while
you were asleep.

19:58.007 --> 20:00.776
Oh.

20:00.843 --> 20:02.711
Hey, Mom?
He says he's been trying

20:02.779 --> 20:04.212
to talk to you about your will.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.747
He certainly has.

20:05.815 --> 20:08.483
It seems to be all
that he wants to talk about.

20:08.551 --> 20:10.285
Well, it's important.

20:10.353 --> 20:12.287
I know you think you're
going to get better,

20:12.355 --> 20:14.289
and I do, too.

20:14.357 --> 20:15.690
Nevertheless, the
prudent thing to do...

20:15.758 --> 20:18.093
Don't lecture me about prudence.

20:18.161 --> 20:20.162
I've read the same
studies that you have,

20:20.229 --> 20:22.264
and I know all the statistics.

20:22.331 --> 20:25.200
Well, then?
Well, then, it might be
the prudent thing to do,

20:25.268 --> 20:26.701
but I don't think
it's necessary.

20:26.769 --> 20:28.303
Mom, you can't be sure.

20:28.371 --> 20:30.172
Of course I can.
How?

20:30.239 --> 20:34.576
Because I have been given
assurance by a higher authority.

20:37.013 --> 20:40.449
You remember three years ago,
when I had my first scare?

20:40.516 --> 20:43.318
I came to see you while I was
waiting for the test results,

20:43.386 --> 20:45.187
and I talked to your wife.

20:45.254 --> 20:49.991
I asked her if she could tell me
anything about my future.

20:50.059 --> 20:52.260
And she had a dream, Joe.

20:52.328 --> 20:55.197
She dreamt that
I was at Bridgette's graduation,

20:55.264 --> 20:58.733
and that I was celebrating with
all of you, the whole family.

20:58.801 --> 21:00.569
And that's years from now.

21:00.636 --> 21:01.570
Mom...

21:01.637 --> 21:04.272
So, I don't really
need to worry

21:04.340 --> 21:07.409
about a new will
right now, do I?

21:13.950 --> 21:14.883
Hello?

21:14.951 --> 21:16.251
Hi.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.886
Joe, hey.
I-I just tried to call you.

21:17.954 --> 21:19.855
It went right to voicemail.
Is everything okay?

21:19.922 --> 21:23.091
I don't know.
My head is spinning.

21:23.159 --> 21:25.827
Plus, I'm staring at
a sign that's telling me

21:25.895 --> 21:27.429
I'm compromising people's health

21:27.497 --> 21:29.631
by talking on a cell phone
in a hospital,

21:29.699 --> 21:31.433
but I don't care.

21:31.501 --> 21:34.436
Joe?

21:34.503 --> 21:37.105
My mother said that you told her
that she was going to live,

21:37.173 --> 21:38.707
at least long enough to see

21:38.774 --> 21:40.442
Bridgette graduate
from high school.

21:42.912 --> 21:44.479
Well, she was sick.

21:44.547 --> 21:46.681
You remember.

21:46.749 --> 21:49.885
She was having tests done,
and she was worried and...

21:49.952 --> 21:52.988
She kept begging me
to dream about her.

21:53.055 --> 21:55.123
And I just couldn't get her
to understand

21:55.191 --> 21:57.158
that it doesn't work that way.

21:57.226 --> 21:59.027
So you lied?

21:59.095 --> 22:01.363
I was trying to give her hope.

22:05.167 --> 22:07.302
Joe...?

22:07.370 --> 22:09.604
She thinks she's going
to beat this.

22:09.672 --> 22:11.773
You get that, right?

22:11.841 --> 22:14.109
She thinks she's gonna come back
from stage four brain cancer

22:14.176 --> 22:16.044
because of what you said.

22:16.112 --> 22:18.780
I mean, she doesn't even
have a proper will.

22:18.848 --> 22:20.849
Okay, I will talk to her.

22:20.917 --> 22:22.751
I will make her understand.

22:22.818 --> 22:24.886
No, I'll make her understand.

22:27.123 --> 22:28.890
I'm sorry. I love you.

22:28.958 --> 22:31.526
Honey, I love you.

22:32.562 --> 22:34.963
How are the girls?

22:35.031 --> 22:36.831
The girls are fine.

22:36.899 --> 22:38.800
Okay. I should go.

22:38.868 --> 22:41.069
Joe, I'm so sorry.

22:41.137 --> 22:42.637
I know.

23:14.954 --> 23:16.571
Everybody copies that.

23:16.622 --> 23:18.439
We're just waiting
on your signal.

24:39.531 --> 24:41.232
I'm sorry, Allison,.

24:41.299 --> 24:43.868
you say that this man
disguises himself as a vagrant?

24:43.935 --> 24:47.171
Look, I'm saying he spotted the
stakeout we set up for him.

24:47.239 --> 24:48.672
He went back
to the parking lot.

24:48.723 --> 24:50.341
He took off his,
what, costume?

24:50.408 --> 24:52.543
He had on nice clothes.

24:52.611 --> 24:53.894
He had a nice haircut.

24:53.979 --> 24:56.013
His car is cleaner than mine.

24:56.081 --> 24:58.716
But Allison, everybody
who has had any kind of
contact with this fella

24:58.783 --> 25:00.885
says not only does he
look the way he does,

25:00.952 --> 25:02.419
but he also reeks of urine.

25:02.487 --> 25:04.121
Okay, what better way
to make sure

25:04.188 --> 25:05.823
no one remembers
what you look like

25:05.891 --> 25:09.493
than to disguise yourself
as one of the kinds of people

25:09.561 --> 25:10.928
that people don't notice?

25:10.996 --> 25:14.215
The kind of person that
people just turn away from.

25:14.299 --> 25:16.901
The kind of person that no one
can bear being around.

25:16.968 --> 25:19.136
I know it sounds crazy,
but this is our suspect.

25:19.204 --> 25:21.038
This is our man.

25:21.106 --> 25:23.140
Allison, we don't even know
if there is a suspect.

25:23.208 --> 25:25.009
For all we know,
this guy Adam Tallmadge

25:25.060 --> 25:27.094
jumped in front
of the train on purpose.

25:27.178 --> 25:28.913
I'm telling you
he was murdered.

25:28.980 --> 25:31.265
He was killed by the same man

25:31.349 --> 25:32.583
who planned on murdering
that woman

25:32.651 --> 25:34.084
at the train station
the same way.

25:34.152 --> 25:36.770
You know what, let's
distribute this sketch.

25:36.855 --> 25:38.389
Say this man is wanted
for questioning

25:38.456 --> 25:40.241
in relation to
Adam Tallmadge's death.

25:40.325 --> 25:42.860
If he does exist, maybe
someone will turn him in.

25:42.928 --> 25:45.429
It's the best I can do, Allison.

25:45.497 --> 25:47.364
Good.

26:03.949 --> 26:06.016
Good morning.

26:06.084 --> 26:08.485
Good afternoon.

26:08.553 --> 26:11.889
Wow. That's some
serious sleeping.

26:11.957 --> 26:14.191
Hmm...

26:14.259 --> 26:16.260
I had no idea.

26:16.328 --> 26:18.428
The nurses said
you had a rough night,

26:18.480 --> 26:20.864
so they gave you a little
something to help you rest.

26:20.932 --> 26:23.133
Can I order you some food?

26:23.201 --> 26:24.635
No, no.

26:24.703 --> 26:27.237
Just-- let's sit
for awhile.

26:34.846 --> 26:37.848
Listen, Mom, I
called Sam Diller.

26:37.916 --> 26:39.883
He's coming by
in a little while

26:39.951 --> 26:41.986
to talk to you
about your will.

26:42.053 --> 26:45.856
Why? I told you I'd take care
of that when I got home.

26:47.859 --> 26:50.828
Mom, I'm just worried that
you're never going to get home.

26:50.895 --> 26:54.465
Why would you say
something like that to me?

26:54.532 --> 26:56.033
I told you...

26:56.101 --> 26:57.801
I know what you told me.

27:00.138 --> 27:02.740
Listen, the things
that Allison said--

27:02.807 --> 27:05.109
the dreams that she said
that she had--

27:05.176 --> 27:08.112
she made them all up.

27:08.179 --> 27:11.315
She knew you were scared,

27:11.383 --> 27:14.485
so she told you these things
to make you feel better.

27:32.437 --> 27:34.972
Go get me my makeup bag.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.574
Your makeup?

27:37.642 --> 27:42.613
If Sam's coming over,
I want to put on some makeup.

27:46.251 --> 27:48.719
Go and get my makeup bag.

28:04.502 --> 28:06.437
Allison, it seems I may
owe you an apology.

28:06.504 --> 28:08.405
It appears likely that
the death of Adam Tallmadge

28:08.473 --> 28:09.573
was a murder, after all.

28:09.641 --> 28:11.241
And we think we've
located a suspect.

28:11.309 --> 28:12.509
You're kidding.

28:12.577 --> 28:15.179
I'm about to go down and
take a look at him now.

28:15.246 --> 28:16.447
Would you care
to join me?

28:16.514 --> 28:20.117
He died of congestive heart
failure sometime last night.

28:20.185 --> 28:22.720
A beat cop found his body
in the Eighth Street alley.

28:22.787 --> 28:25.823
I know you said he was only
pretending to be homeless,

28:25.890 --> 28:28.609
but if he was, he was
doing a hell of a job.

28:28.693 --> 28:31.228
Cop found his body
beside a shopping cart

28:31.296 --> 28:33.030
full of the guy's stuff.

28:33.081 --> 28:36.116
It sure as hell looked like
he was living out of there.

28:36.201 --> 28:37.901
We don't have an I.D. yet,

28:37.969 --> 28:40.704
but hopefully it's only
a matter of time.

28:44.776 --> 28:46.009
That's not him.

28:46.077 --> 28:47.778
That's not the man who
killed Adam Tallmadge.

28:47.846 --> 28:49.680
I beg to differ.

28:49.748 --> 28:52.883
He was wearing the exact
same coat you described.

28:52.951 --> 28:54.451
The same one three
other witnesses saw

28:54.519 --> 28:55.953
the morning Tallmadge died.

28:56.020 --> 28:58.122
And we found Tallmadge's watch
inside his shopping cart.

28:58.189 --> 28:59.556
What else do you need, Allison?

28:59.624 --> 29:01.458
This man obviously
wasn't wearing

29:01.526 --> 29:03.026
any kind of disguise.

29:03.094 --> 29:04.328
But the evidence
does indicate

29:04.395 --> 29:06.630
that he was involved in
Adam Tallmadge's death.

29:06.698 --> 29:11.602
Is it possible that you somehow
misinterpreted what you saw?

29:11.669 --> 29:14.004
I don't know, maybe.

29:22.213 --> 29:24.281
I think his name was Jerry.

29:24.349 --> 29:25.949
Excuse me?

29:26.017 --> 29:28.018
Jerry.
Why do you say that?

29:28.086 --> 29:29.553
Well, he's got a name tag.

29:29.621 --> 29:31.655
Name tag?

29:35.794 --> 29:39.396
It was just right here.

29:39.464 --> 29:41.231
It said "Burger Palace."

29:41.299 --> 29:44.001
It was the same kind
of name tag that
Adam Tallmadge had.

29:44.068 --> 29:46.103
It said his
name was Jerry.

29:46.171 --> 29:48.038
Jerry, huh, from
the Burger Palace?

29:48.106 --> 29:50.207
All right, I'll
check it out.

29:50.275 --> 29:51.842
Although it doesn't look
like Jerry here's

29:51.910 --> 29:54.178
held down a job
for quite some time.

30:06.357 --> 30:07.291
Hello.

30:07.358 --> 30:08.659
Hey, it's me.

30:08.726 --> 30:10.127
Oh, hey, Joe.

30:10.195 --> 30:13.163
I saw your mom's name come up
on the caller I.D., and...

30:13.231 --> 30:14.298
and I panicked.

30:14.365 --> 30:17.518
Yeah, I'm calling you
from her house.

30:17.602 --> 30:19.903
It's so weird being here
by myself,

30:19.971 --> 30:21.972
with everything that's going on.

30:22.040 --> 30:23.774
How is she doing?

30:23.842 --> 30:25.776
She's the same.

30:25.844 --> 30:29.346
Did you guys get a chance
to talk?

30:29.414 --> 30:31.181
We sure did.

30:31.249 --> 30:33.450
So how did it go?

30:33.518 --> 30:36.119
Well, she's a rock.

30:36.187 --> 30:39.022
She absorbed it,
and then she put on makeup

30:39.090 --> 30:42.059
so she could meet her lawyer
and revise her will.

30:42.126 --> 30:44.661
I'm so sorry.

30:44.729 --> 30:47.931
I-I still feel
terrible about this.

30:47.999 --> 30:51.368
She really wants
to see the girls, Al.

30:51.436 --> 30:53.704
She wants to see all of you.

30:53.771 --> 30:55.706
I think it's time.

30:58.009 --> 30:59.576
Okay.

30:59.644 --> 31:01.879
I'm going to get off the phone,
get on the computer

31:01.946 --> 31:04.882
and I'll book us a flight
for first thing in the morning.

31:04.949 --> 31:07.084
I think
that would make her happy.

31:07.151 --> 31:10.654
Please tell her again
how sorry I am.

31:10.722 --> 31:13.457
And I really look forward
to seeing her.

31:13.524 --> 31:15.392
Of course I will.

31:15.460 --> 31:17.861
I really miss you.

31:17.929 --> 31:19.763
I miss you.

31:19.831 --> 31:21.498
Hopefully I'll see you tomorrow.

31:21.566 --> 31:24.067
Yeah. Honey, of course you're
going to see us tomorrow.

31:24.135 --> 31:26.036
I love you.

31:26.104 --> 31:27.537
I love you.

31:37.582 --> 31:39.583
I'm sorry, Jerry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

31:39.651 --> 31:42.686
Oh, this damn cough.

31:42.754 --> 31:44.688
It's me, it's
David Ostrowski.

31:47.091 --> 31:49.626
We worked together
years ago-- Burger Palace.

31:52.263 --> 31:56.633
The Burger Palace--
I remember.

31:56.701 --> 31:59.136
That's right, summer of '88.

31:59.203 --> 32:01.271
You worked the
fry-o-later,

32:01.339 --> 32:02.873
Adam Tallmadge
worked the grill.

32:02.941 --> 32:04.007
I handled the register.

32:05.777 --> 32:09.880
You came to see me
a couple weeks ago.

32:09.948 --> 32:13.617
You... bought my jacket from me.

32:13.685 --> 32:17.487
That's good, Jerry. Yes,
I did buy your jacket.

32:17.555 --> 32:20.958
And now I'm here
to give it back.

32:21.025 --> 32:22.426
No.

32:23.461 --> 32:24.928
Uh-uh. No!

32:24.996 --> 32:27.497
A deal's a deal.

32:27.565 --> 32:29.566
Plus, I already spent
the money you gave me.

32:29.634 --> 32:31.601
I don't want the
money back, Jerry.

32:31.669 --> 32:34.071
I just want to give
the jacket back.

32:34.138 --> 32:35.806
I can't use it anymore.

32:35.873 --> 32:37.607
Use it?

32:39.210 --> 32:41.311
Yeah.

32:41.379 --> 32:43.580
I had some stuff
to take care of,

32:43.648 --> 32:46.550
and I'm finished now,
and so I'm giving it back.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.120
Here.

32:53.491 --> 32:55.692
Let me help
you put it on.

33:06.604 --> 33:08.805
It's okay.

33:08.873 --> 33:11.041
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

33:28.359 --> 33:29.993
David...

33:33.765 --> 33:35.766
Allison?

33:38.269 --> 33:41.004
Marjorie.

33:45.710 --> 33:47.144
Hello?

33:47.211 --> 33:49.312
Hey.

33:49.380 --> 33:51.081
I'm sorry to call so late,

33:51.149 --> 33:54.551
but I just heard
from the hospital.

33:54.619 --> 33:57.054
Mom's gone.

34:06.991 --> 34:09.192
Mr. Ostrowski,
good morning.

34:09.260 --> 34:11.393
Manuel Devalos. Thank you
for coming on such short notice.

34:15.132 --> 34:17.065
That's a nasty cough, sir.
You feeling all right?

34:17.134 --> 34:18.467
It's always like that.

34:18.534 --> 34:19.668
It's a chronic thing.

34:19.737 --> 34:20.837
I'm a little confused.

34:20.904 --> 34:22.338
Are you sure you have
the right Ostrowski?

34:22.406 --> 34:24.274
I can't imagine what you folks
could want with me.

34:24.341 --> 34:25.507
We just have a
few questions.

34:25.559 --> 34:27.842
Shouldn't take long. Please.

34:27.895 --> 34:29.512
No. I'm sorry.

34:29.580 --> 34:30.880
He doesn't look familiar to me.

34:30.947 --> 34:33.483
His name is Adam Tallmadge.

34:33.534 --> 34:35.818
The two of you
worked together years ago

34:35.869 --> 34:38.821
at a branch of the Burger Palace
in Chandler.

34:38.871 --> 34:40.255
I believe our research indicated

34:40.324 --> 34:43.092
it was the summer
of 1988?

34:43.159 --> 34:44.594
Wow. Okay.

34:44.661 --> 34:46.262
That was a long time ago.

34:46.330 --> 34:48.665
Mr. Tallmadge was
killed recently.

34:48.732 --> 34:51.668
Someone pushed him in front of a
commuter train a few days ago.

34:51.735 --> 34:53.268
Seriously?

34:53.337 --> 34:54.904
I heard about that,

34:54.972 --> 34:57.005
but I had no idea
that I knew the person.

34:57.074 --> 34:59.075
Look, I don't know
how I can help you guys.

34:59.143 --> 35:00.109
I honestly don't remember him.

35:00.177 --> 35:01.728
There were a lot of us
who worked

35:01.812 --> 35:03.413
at the Burger Palace
that summer.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.415
There were 14, actually.
We checked.

35:09.103 --> 35:10.286
That's Jerry Thornton.

35:10.354 --> 35:12.071
He's another coworker.

35:13.424 --> 35:15.058
Okay.

35:15.125 --> 35:16.459
If you say so.

35:16.527 --> 35:19.429
But he obviously didn't look
like that 20 years ago.

35:19.496 --> 35:20.863
Mr. Thornton's
been homeless

35:20.931 --> 35:22.598
for the better part of a decade.

35:22.666 --> 35:24.434
We found him dead
the other night.

35:24.501 --> 35:27.270
Initially, it looked like
a simple case of heart failure.

35:27.338 --> 35:30.473
We did a routine tox screen,
and nothing unusual came up.

35:30.541 --> 35:31.474
Okay.

35:31.542 --> 35:32.709
Then I received a tip

35:32.776 --> 35:34.043
suggesting we look
a little closer.

35:34.111 --> 35:35.678
We ran some additional tests.

35:35.746 --> 35:38.614
Turns out your old friend died
from an insulin overdose.

35:38.682 --> 35:40.683
If you give someone too much
of the stuff,

35:40.751 --> 35:42.485
it causes
a hypoglycemic reaction.

35:42.553 --> 35:45.455
Cause of death appears
to be heart failure...

35:45.522 --> 35:47.223
unless you know
what to look for.

35:54.965 --> 35:56.265
Okay.

35:56.316 --> 35:58.701
Uh, I... I'll take
your word for it.

35:58.769 --> 36:00.470
But why are you telling me this?

36:00.537 --> 36:03.339
Indulge us for another moment.

36:05.509 --> 36:06.993
That's Ingrid Martinez.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.578
She worked with you, too.

36:08.645 --> 36:10.380
We think that someone
was planning to push her

36:10.447 --> 36:11.981
in front of a train
earlier this week.

36:12.049 --> 36:13.850
It didn't happen
because we placed

36:13.917 --> 36:15.885
extra law enforcement
at the station.

36:15.953 --> 36:17.754
Okay.

36:17.821 --> 36:19.255
We believe all three
of these events

36:19.323 --> 36:20.623
are connected, Mr. Ostrowski.

36:20.691 --> 36:24.627
I'm sorry. Connected how?

36:24.695 --> 36:28.164
Because they all had
the same summer job back in '88?

36:28.232 --> 36:30.933
I know--
sounds crazy.

36:31.001 --> 36:33.770
But did you know
that during the summer of 1988,

36:33.837 --> 36:35.738
the insulation
in the Burger Palace kitchen

36:35.806 --> 36:37.373
where you worked
contained asbestos?

36:38.409 --> 36:39.842
I think you must.

36:39.910 --> 36:42.779
After all, you filed a
suit against Burger Palace

36:42.846 --> 36:44.747
alleging that the
asbestos in the piping

36:44.815 --> 36:46.149
caused that cough of yours.

36:47.284 --> 36:48.885
Yes, that's true.
I did file a suit.

36:48.952 --> 36:50.119
Is something wrong with that?

36:50.187 --> 36:51.821
No, not at all.

36:51.889 --> 36:54.290
And from what I understand,
it's quite a compelling case.

36:54.358 --> 36:55.925
So compelling,
as a matter of fact,

36:55.993 --> 36:58.594
that the Burger Palace
didn't want to take it to court.

36:58.662 --> 37:00.830
Which is why
they offered to settle.

37:00.898 --> 37:03.232
They realized that if they
did settle with you,

37:03.300 --> 37:05.001
they would face lawsuits
from everybody

37:05.068 --> 37:07.136
who worked at that franchise
in 1988.

37:07.204 --> 37:08.805
Which is why they offered
you a group settlement.

37:08.872 --> 37:11.374
One lump sum, to be divided
among all the workers

37:11.442 --> 37:13.576
who were exposed
to that asbestos.

37:13.644 --> 37:15.711
Now, to hear their lawyers
tell it,

37:15.779 --> 37:17.780
they gave you a choice.

37:17.848 --> 37:20.082
Accept the group route or...

37:20.150 --> 37:21.517
they would use
their considerable resources

37:21.585 --> 37:23.519
to tie your suit up in court
for years.

37:23.587 --> 37:24.687
Well, they're a big company.

37:24.755 --> 37:26.222
And yes, they're playing
hardball. So?

37:26.290 --> 37:28.758
So, you knew
that the fewer people around

37:28.826 --> 37:31.027
to claim their piece
of the settlement,

37:31.094 --> 37:33.296
the larger your share would be.

37:33.363 --> 37:34.730
Our guess is that

37:34.798 --> 37:36.499
every member of the group
that was eliminated

37:36.567 --> 37:38.434
is worth about
an extra million to you.

37:41.205 --> 37:43.439
You can't prove any of that.

37:49.580 --> 37:52.582
I urge you to take
a look at the stain

37:52.649 --> 37:54.584
on the right elbow
of that jacket.

37:54.651 --> 37:56.285
We believe it's mucus.

37:56.353 --> 37:58.387
The right elbow--
that's where you tend

37:58.455 --> 38:00.556
to cover your mouth
when you're hacking up phlegm

38:00.624 --> 38:02.191
from your asbestosis,
isn't it?

38:02.259 --> 38:05.695
If we were to test your
DNA against the DNA

38:05.762 --> 38:07.463
on that portion
of the jacket,

38:07.531 --> 38:09.265
we'd find a match,
wouldn't we?

38:16.173 --> 38:17.473
Hey.
Hey.

38:20.344 --> 38:24.046
Oh. Oh, honey.

38:28.252 --> 38:31.304
I'm sorry
I couldn't pick you up.

38:32.789 --> 38:35.525
Honey, how can I help you?

38:35.592 --> 38:36.759
Did you get any

38:36.827 --> 38:38.528
sleep last night?

38:38.595 --> 38:42.698
You mean, like, in a bed,
where you close your eyes?

38:42.766 --> 38:46.402
Sweetie, you need
to get some rest.

38:46.470 --> 38:50.473
I would that I could,
but I got a eulogy to write.

38:55.512 --> 38:57.713
You know what I regret?

38:57.781 --> 39:00.816
I regret that I didn't let you
make that call.

39:02.252 --> 39:05.521
I regret that the two of you
didn't get to talk.

39:08.642 --> 39:11.360
She loved you, Allison.

39:11.428 --> 39:15.131
She loved that I
was married to you.

39:15.198 --> 39:17.533
And I think she understood
about the lie.

39:17.601 --> 39:18.935
I do.

39:19.002 --> 39:21.771
I even kind of think she
was grateful for it.

39:22.806 --> 39:24.440
Come on.

39:25.475 --> 39:27.777
You get some rest.

39:27.828 --> 39:30.646
It was such a long trip.

39:30.714 --> 39:32.031
Okay.

39:32.115 --> 39:34.750
I'm going to be in the
living room for a little bit,

39:34.818 --> 39:37.119
trying to sum up a life.

39:47.097 --> 39:49.298
Oh. Did you just get back?

39:54.771 --> 39:56.872
Who are you
talking to?

39:56.940 --> 39:58.941
♪ ♪

40:18.261 --> 40:20.563
♪ ♪

40:41.985 --> 40:44.020
He's writing
a beautiful eulogy.

40:44.087 --> 40:48.257
He's really
a pretty terrific son.

40:52.863 --> 40:56.332
He's a pretty terrific
husband, too.

40:56.400 --> 40:59.035
God, I was worried about you.

41:00.637 --> 41:04.540
Last night,
when you came to see me,

41:04.608 --> 41:08.177
you came and went so quickly.

41:08.245 --> 41:11.447
I was worried
that you were angry.

41:11.515 --> 41:14.350
No. Just confused.

41:14.418 --> 41:18.120
I didn't really understand
what had just happened to me.

41:18.188 --> 41:21.157
I felt wonderful
and wonderfully sad

41:21.224 --> 41:23.192
all at the same time.

41:23.260 --> 41:26.529
It's funny-- nothing in life
prepares you for death.

41:28.832 --> 41:33.769
I feel terrible
about what I did--

41:33.837 --> 41:37.773
deceiving you like that,
giving you false hope.

41:37.841 --> 41:41.077
It's okay. I understood.

41:42.612 --> 41:44.246
But how could you?

41:44.314 --> 41:46.782
I just did.

41:49.586 --> 41:52.722
I knew from the first day
you told me.

41:52.789 --> 41:57.460
Deep down, I thought...
this is a lie.

41:57.527 --> 42:01.230
This is a beautiful,
generous lie.

42:01.298 --> 42:03.866
But I liked it, so I lived it.

42:03.934 --> 42:06.569
As long as I could, anyway.

42:06.636 --> 42:09.038
It seemed so much nicer
than the truth.

42:13.210 --> 42:18.481
Take care of my boy
and my granddaughters.

42:21.518 --> 42:25.187
I've peeked,
and there's some darkness ahead.

42:26.223 --> 42:27.990
What do you mean?

42:28.058 --> 42:30.025
What kind of darkness?

42:30.093 --> 42:32.928
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

42:36.366 --> 42:39.635
It's going to be
a wonderful life.

42:39.703 --> 42:41.403
Well, wait.

42:41.471 --> 42:43.839
Tell me about the darkness.
Allison.

42:44.941 --> 42:47.042
Who you talking to?

42:52.783 --> 42:56.152
Nothing. No one.
