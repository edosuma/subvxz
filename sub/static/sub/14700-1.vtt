00:36.360 --> 00:40.600
- First time here ?
- Me ? No, I used to live here.

00:41.040 --> 00:44.200
- For ten years.
- And you left ?

00:47.200 --> 00:51.080
- So, what brings you back ?
- I'm here for a wedding.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.440
Yours ?

00:54.920 --> 00:58.600
- No.
- So, is it good to be back ?

01:02.160 --> 01:05.560
- Ask me in a couple of days.
- Fair enough.

01:26.160 --> 01:32.240
LOOKING

01:36.840 --> 01:38.200
Thank you.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.640
- Looks who's ambled into town.
- Hey, boys.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.000
I love that you're late. I don't
think you've ever been late.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.800
Maybe I'm finally becoming fashionable.
I love your beard.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.520
I told you nine months is all it takes
to make a new man out of him.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.440
- Stop it.
- No, no, we need more lisp.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.240
How long has it
been since we've been here ?

02:07.320 --> 02:08.639
My twenty-third birthday,

02:08.720 --> 02:11.400
I had sex with the waiter and you
threw up in toilet, over there.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.080
Good times. Fuck, it is so good
to see you guys.

02:14.160 --> 02:15.520
You, too.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.400
I'm sorry I've been so bad lately,

02:17.480 --> 02:18.920
it's just that work
has been super hectic

02:19.000 --> 02:21.680
and it doesn't help
I've de-activated my Facebook,

02:21.760 --> 02:23.200
but that's not an excuse.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.880
Don't worry, it's all going fine.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.200
Last Tuesday there was a line
all the way down the block.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.240
- That's amazing.
- It's getting there.

02:30.320 --> 02:33.720
He promised me tonight he wouldn't
check the window, not even once.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.240
- Maybe once.
- No, no you swore, not even a text.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.360
- Okay, Jesus.
- How's the Art Institute ?

02:40.440 --> 02:43.720
These punk art-school brats, they
have no respect for the equipment.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.040
But I can almost pay rent, now,
so that's something.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.240
My balls are here.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.600
What is the plan for tonight ?

02:52.680 --> 02:55.920
First up
is Li Po for Chinese Mai Tais.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.920
We haven't been there
in a million years.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.280
Doris and Malik
are gonna meet us there.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.280
- Nice. How are they ?
- They're good, I think.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.280
He hasn't thrown her out,
so that's something.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.600
- They went to Hawaii recently.
- Richie and Brady are coming too.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.760
What ? You invited them ?
No, I'm kidding.

03:11.640 --> 03:15.240
I think it's gonna be nice to see them,
both of them.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.320
In fact, I made a pact
with myself on the plane

03:18.400 --> 03:20.320
that I was gonna try
and make a real effort with Brady.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.920
That's good,
'cause he's actually pretty cool.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.800
When he's not drunk.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.160
Wait a second.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.520
We gotta raise a glass.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.120
To the new, grown up Agustin.
To all of us, really,

03:34.200 --> 03:37.720
for finally finding something
close to adulthood, right ?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.360
Close to it.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.320
It took us long enough.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.960
- Would you stop eating my balls ?
- I love your balls.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.600
I can't get enough of your balls.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.360
Nothing has changed.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.080
Heya, stranger.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.600
I'm good.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.040
Since you've been gone, I've been
embracing my heterosexuality.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.080
I went on a wine tour.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.080
Which she got thrown off
for getting wasted.

04:14.160 --> 04:17.800
We get couples massages,
we got book club,

04:17.880 --> 04:19.880
I have like dinner parties,
where I kind of cook a little bit.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.560
Which we don't get invited to.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.080
You would come if I invited you ?

04:23.160 --> 04:24.520
Probably not.
There's only so many times

04:24.600 --> 04:26.240
I can hear you talk
about the container store.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.960
I love the container store ! Would
you rather we talk about poultry ?

04:29.040 --> 04:30.040
No.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.800
Do I hear the ding-dong
of wedding bells ?

04:31.880 --> 04:34.200
Are the two of you gonna follow
Agustin down the aisle ?

04:34.280 --> 04:37.360
Sorry, Disney princess,
no that dream's not happening.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.600
I'm embracing my heterosexuality,
but I'm not insane.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.920
So, that's a no ?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.920
Malik and I made a very important
commitment to living in sin.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.720
We embrace the sin. Sunday morning ?
We're not in church.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.640
Marriage is for the gays.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.280
And you poor fuckin bastards,
you can have it.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.040
It's a magical time !

04:55.680 --> 04:58.400
This is the best news ever.
Congratulations.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.240
Congratulations, Augustin.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.560
How you doing ?

05:08.080 --> 05:10.640
- Hey, Brady !
- The prodigal son returns !

05:10.720 --> 05:12.160
Hi. Good to see you.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.600
How are you ?

05:19.360 --> 05:23.640
- Hi, Kyah!
- I'm so the new Patrick of the group.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.120
We're all back together.

05:33.880 --> 05:37.400
Patrick, how is it going ?
I want to hear about...

05:37.880 --> 05:39.680
How's Boise ?

05:39.760 --> 05:41.920
It's Denver, not Boise.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.560
Same thing.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.080
But it's good, I'm loving work

05:45.160 --> 05:47.280
and I'm finally
the head of my own department.

05:47.360 --> 05:52.240
No more cage fighting homos ?
No more otter vs owls ?

05:52.320 --> 05:54.600
Not at work, at least.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.080
What is it you're actually doing ? I've
asked but nobody seems to know.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.000
We're developing
this virtual reality video game

06:00.080 --> 06:03.240
where humans have mated with aliens,
and they've created

06:03.320 --> 06:05.280
this super-race
with special abilities.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.960
- I'm so in.
- It's a cool game.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.480
Of course you're in.
Anything with aliens, sold.

06:12.520 --> 06:14.640
But what is there to do in
Salt Lake City ? What do you do ?

06:14.720 --> 06:15.920
Denver.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.480
What do you do in Denver ?
Goddammit, sorry.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.480
You don't miss it here ?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.760
I miss you guys.
I miss the people, for sure.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.600
But in a lot of ways,
the cities are very similar,

06:25.680 --> 06:28.760
it's the same small batch coffee,
the same Korean meat-balls,

06:28.840 --> 06:31.560
except people there are a little less
San Francisco.

06:31.640 --> 06:35.960
In the way that people in San Francisco
can be annoying.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.080
I totally get it.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.080
But the Denver people,
they're really cool.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.360
Are there any gays in Denver ?

06:42.440 --> 06:44.520
Yeah, there's a lot of gays,
it's a big city,

06:44.600 --> 06:48.320
And Paddy's been making the most
of being the single cowgirl in town.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.000
I have, indeed.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.440
They're like Brokeback Mountain,

06:51.520 --> 06:55.080
are you just like having sex
with Jake Gyllenhaal ?

06:55.160 --> 06:59.720
No, but, I broke
this back mountain a couple times.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.760
Girl, you changed.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.040
I can't believe
I have this stupid bag.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.640
Your hair looks good.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.080
- Thank you.
- Kept it short, huh ?

07:17.160 --> 07:19.960
Yeah, short on the sides.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.000
It's good to see you.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.080
You, too.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.720
Sorry I was so incommunicado,

07:26.800 --> 07:28.760
but it felt like the right thing
to do while I got settled.

07:28.840 --> 07:31.320
You don't need to explain.

07:31.400 --> 07:35.080
Yeah, but I left so suddenly
without much of an explanation.

07:35.160 --> 07:39.040
You did what you had to do.
So don't sweat it.

07:42.440 --> 07:46.040
What's it like being back home,
so close to your folks ?

07:46.120 --> 07:47.640
I'm near home, I'm not at home,

07:47.720 --> 07:51.160
and that 50 minute car-ride
makes all the difference.

07:51.320 --> 07:55.600
Butit's been pretty positive.
I never thought

07:55.680 --> 07:57.800
that I could actually be there
and be myself,

07:57.880 --> 07:59.920
so that feels like progress.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.600
That's good.
And how's your mom ?

08:02.680 --> 08:05.400
She's all right.
It's probably helpful I was there

08:05.480 --> 08:09.320
and only semi-judgmental
about her choice to drop my dad.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.200
How are you about the divorce ?

08:12.280 --> 08:15.480
- I'm thirty.
- I don't think that matters.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.360
She dumped the guy
that she left my dad for,

08:20.440 --> 08:24.400
and now she's having sex
with her therapist, Dr. Samperstein.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.120
Really ?

08:26.200 --> 08:29.800
She really likes to make
a fuckin mess of things.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.799
But then,
like mother like son, I guess.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.880
I'm saying nothing.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.240
I finally followed your advice

08:41.320 --> 08:44.039
and tried to work things out
with my dad.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.240
It turns out that advice
totally sucked.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.520
Shit, really ?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.800
Yeah. I tried to honor the fact

08:49.880 --> 08:52.240
that he would never really be
completely happy with who I am,

08:52.320 --> 08:54.800
and tried to find
a common ground, but...

08:54.880 --> 08:56.200
There was none ?

08:56.280 --> 08:58.600
Turns out
he is a raging homophobe.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.840
It's like him
trying to understand me

09:00.920 --> 09:03.400
undermines everything he thinks
he knows about himself. So...

09:03.480 --> 09:06.320
Do you think
he'll ever come around ?

09:06.400 --> 09:09.240
He's a proud fucker,
so probably not.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.640
If I'm like my mom, then...

09:13.760 --> 09:19.040
Shut up. But Brady has been
really cool about the whole thing.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.040
He's been super supportive,
so that's helped.

09:23.120 --> 09:28.040
Good. What about the barber truck ?
I've been hearing amazing things.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.520
- It's going really well.
- And you don't miss Willy's ?

09:31.600 --> 09:34.360
Yeah, but it's also good
to be doing my own thing.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.440
Agustin did a really great job
with the paint-work on it.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.520
He's really good.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.200
I can just picture you cruising
down Valencia

09:43.280 --> 09:46.920
luring people into your truck
for a fade. It's kind of perfect.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.760
Sometimes, I want to drive
to Reno and start doing perms

09:49.840 --> 09:53.040
in some casino parking lot.
Just to do something different.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.120
That would be the best reality
show, ever. Or maybe the worst.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.400
It's basically the same thing.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.840
You should come by some time.
See me in action.

10:01.920 --> 10:06.920
I'd like that. If not this trip,
then the next one, for sure.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.160
Here they are !

10:10.240 --> 10:13.880
- We thought we'd lost you.
- I know, it's this bag.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.760
Agustin has totally convinced me.
I'm pro-marriage now.

10:18.760 --> 10:19.760
You fuckin' traitor.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.600
- You wanna get married ?
- Right now ?

10:22.680 --> 10:26.840
- Maybe not right now.
- Come on !

10:29.720 --> 10:31.320
You all right ?

10:31.400 --> 10:35.280
- I'm good, how you feelin' ?
- I'm good. I'm a little tired.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.480
- You gonna sing ?
- Yeah !

10:37.560 --> 10:41.800
What are you gonna sing ?
What are we gonna sing together ?

10:44.760 --> 10:46.760
I love that you've chosen
all of our old haunts.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.960
I felt like I needed to return
to the scenes of my crimes.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.160
You're not dying.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.640
This whole getting married
thing is making me feel all...

10:53.720 --> 10:56.360
I don't think that the air quotes
are necessary.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.640
Oh, shit.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.080
- Bride to be.
- You made it.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.120
Of course. Miss Murray !

11:07.040 --> 11:08.120
How's it going ?

11:08.200 --> 11:11.800
Good, you took the Concorde
in from Paris ?

11:11.880 --> 11:15.200
Yes. It's so good to see you.
What a surprise !

11:15.880 --> 11:18.040
What are you ladies drinking ?
I'm buying.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.400
- Something cheap and strong.
- Yeah, just like you.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.720
- I'll take it.
- I'm kidding.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.360
So, you guys are friends, now,
like actual friends ?

11:29.440 --> 11:30.800
Who reached out to who ?

11:30.880 --> 11:33.240
I felt like I needed to close that
chapter before I opened a new one,

11:33.320 --> 11:36.320
I called him up.
I thought I told you,

11:36.400 --> 11:38.640
No, it's great.
He's always been a good guy.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.920
Just because it didn't work out
doesn't mean

11:41.000 --> 11:44.240
it couldn't turn into something new.
Plus Eddie's cool with it.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.080
- Of course he is.
- He's the best.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.640
BT dubs, you and I are singing.
For old time's sake !

11:50.720 --> 11:53.680
I love you, but bad things happen
when I get behind a microphone.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.400
No, badass things.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.480
Oh my god !

12:04.080 --> 12:07.120
Why isn't he making
eye contact with me ?

12:09.360 --> 12:10.760
I remember.

12:10.840 --> 12:14.960
I think his exact words were,
I'd rather seal up my butthole

12:15.040 --> 12:19.120
and never suck another cock again
rather than get married.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.720
I can't believe that gay people
are so desperate to be straight.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.120
They shouldn't even be called
gay any more.

12:24.200 --> 12:28.880
- Did I really sound that annoying ?
- No, you don't, he was a total cunt.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.640
I miss cunty Agustin.
He was fun at parties.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.960
You've become one of those gay guys
you always hated.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.440
Soon you'll be adopting babies

12:35.520 --> 12:38.800
and going on cruises
with the other Stepford homos.

12:38.880 --> 12:43.000
- Leave him alone.
- What you're doing is amazing.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.640
You know I'm kidding.
I'm thrilled.

12:47.720 --> 12:52.960
Eddie is a shining light
of awesomeness in your life.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.640
And you're doing it
for the right reasons.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.720
So, what's there not to love ?

12:58.800 --> 13:01.480
Thank you, Frank.
That was beautiful.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.480
Just don't fuck it up.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.640
Stay away from rent boys
for a start.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.680
I know that I said I wouldn't,
but fuck it. Let's do this.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.040
- We're gonna sing ?
- Yes, we're gonna sing.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.320
- Can I finally be Justin ?
- Yes !

13:16.400 --> 13:17.400
Let's do it !

13:17.480 --> 13:19.480
I will never suck a cock again !

13:19.560 --> 13:22.400
That's my advice,
stay away from rent boys.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.480
This was actually the first club me
and Paddy ever came to in the city.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.320
It's also where
me and Paddy hooked up.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.600
Yes, it was.

13:29.680 --> 13:33.760
Muscle Mary and goodie-two-shoes,
get the fuck outta here.

13:33.840 --> 13:36.320
I didn't know you guys hooked up.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.640
Yes, but it was a long time ago
and we do not need to go back there.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.960
- Yeah we do.
- No, we do not.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.960
Story !

13:44.080 --> 13:46.440
Once upon a time there was
a pretty princess called Paddy,

13:46.520 --> 13:50.240
he was all by himself,
poor lonely baby, totally wasted

13:50.320 --> 13:52.000
and dancing to Britney, remember ?

13:52.080 --> 13:53.080
I do.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.960
I'm assuming we've all seen
Paddy's drunk dancing.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.440
- What's it like ?
- Enthusiastic.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.640
Did you guys fuck ?

14:03.040 --> 14:04.240
I wouldn't say fuck.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.360
It was more like
side by side jerking off,

14:06.440 --> 14:08.720
although I do remember
almost giving you a blowjob.

14:08.800 --> 14:13.000
I remember you licking the side
but refusing to put the tip in.

14:13.080 --> 14:15.680
I was very disease-phobic
in those days.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.040
I had a lot
of self-loathing back then.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.880
Back then ?

14:20.280 --> 14:22.040
That was a joke !

14:24.480 --> 14:26.960
I'm glad you cried on my shoulder
I didn't put my dick in your butt

14:27.040 --> 14:29.240
because look where we are now.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.720
Hey, faggots !

14:34.720 --> 14:36.760
I am so glad you came in for this.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.600
He never would have did it
without his maid of dishonor.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.080
I wouldn't have missed this for
the world, are you kidding ? Please.

14:41.160 --> 14:42.440
And this is my friend Jake.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.040
He's my oldest
and dearest from Chicago.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.960
I'm trying to get him to move here,
so please play nice with others !

14:48.000 --> 14:50.360
I want you to meet Dom. Dom ?

14:50.440 --> 14:53.480
He saw your pic and he really
wants to taste your chicken.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.520
What was that ?

14:58.600 --> 15:01.160
He's cute. You've literally
had nothing for months.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.960
Plus, from what Eddie says,

15:03.040 --> 15:06.680
he has the most beautiful penis
in all of Illinois.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.920
Dance with me our last time
as single girls.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.880
A nice Midwestern girl.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.680
What ?

15:17.760 --> 15:19.680
He's really cute.
I feel like you should go for it.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.120
You're as bad as Doris.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.600
- What's the harm ?
- I gotta pee.

15:26.040 --> 15:30.360
I wanna see you guys on the dance
floor later. Both of you.

15:30.440 --> 15:31.800
Tequila ?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
I wanna dance on the bar.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.680
Last time I was here,
I was in a leather vest.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.480
I remember.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.080
That seems like a long time ago.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.520
It does.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.760
I'm glad you left, you know ?

16:11.120 --> 16:13.800
- What ?
- You know what I mean ?

16:14.120 --> 16:19.720
It took a lot of guts, and it seems
to have done you a lot of good.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.320
You think ?

16:24.240 --> 16:28.720
Sometimes you gotta leave things
behind so you can move forward.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.680
- I got you a tequila.
- Thank you !

16:32.760 --> 16:35.680
You haven't tasted it yet,
it's the cheap stuff.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.640
Cheers.

16:41.280 --> 16:44.440
- That is the cheap stuff.
- Get your ass out on the dance floor.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.320
How could I resist the call
of Britney ?

16:47.760 --> 16:49.320
You coming ?

16:49.440 --> 16:53.000
I think I need another drink first but
looking forward to see you move.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.320
I can't hear you.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.120
Richie !

17:00.200 --> 17:03.400
Fine. Let's just dance.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.320
Holy fuck.
You're really good at that.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.240
I've been training.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.880
I think I want you to fuck me.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.320
We don't have to
if you don't want to,

17:57.400 --> 17:59.440
- Don't you want to fuck me ?
- Yeah.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.320
Then do it.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.600
You feel so good.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.840
Can you put the brakes on,
a bit ?

18:08.920 --> 18:10.720
Sorry, is it hurting ?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.480
Don't flatter yourself.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.840
No, I just don't to come too...

18:14.920 --> 18:17.880
It's way too late for that,
just go faster.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.520
Harder, harder !

18:29.440 --> 18:31.520
I'm gonna come.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.200
So, how do you like it at Zynga ?

18:49.280 --> 18:52.760
You get free Reese's Pieces,
what's not to love ?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.600
That's how they get you.
All that sugar.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.520
Watch out, you don't want
to get stuck in their fly traps.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.920
- Is that why you left MDG ?
- Something like that.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.200
Come on, spill the beans.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.240
Okay, fine. I was in a relationship
with my boss.

19:07.320 --> 19:10.640
But after we broke up,
the office was like that movie Saw,

19:10.720 --> 19:14.160
except without the cute guy chained
to the wall.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.560
It wasn't Kevin Matheson, was it ?

19:19.640 --> 19:20.960
What ?

19:21.040 --> 19:22.480
My god, it was, wasn't it ?

19:22.560 --> 19:23.600
Why do you say that ?

19:23.680 --> 19:26.440
I know he works there,
and he's gay.

19:26.520 --> 19:29.400
That's why I hate this fucking
city, it's so small.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.480
Please don't tell me
that you had sex with him.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.640
No, no, but I would.

19:35.720 --> 19:39.800
Those ears,
I would tug on those babies.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.440
I did interview with him
back in January.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.280
Oh, my god, for my job.

19:46.360 --> 19:52.040
I didn't get it. I heard he hired
a 19 year old muscle queen from LA.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.440
Of course, he did.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.800
I take it you two don't talk ?

19:59.880 --> 20:04.240
Talk, no, but he PayPals me
every now and again

20:04.320 --> 20:06.680
for this game
we designed together.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.560
- Cha-ching.
- I wish.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.520
I would so happily give up
those ninety dollars

20:10.600 --> 20:13.280
just so I didn't have
to see his name in my in-box.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.760
So, why don't you ?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.680
You have to bury your dead
real good,

20:16.760 --> 20:19.800
so they don't come back
and haunt you.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.920
Who made you so fucking wise ?

20:23.000 --> 20:27.080
What ? I'm twenty-two, I've had
my fair share of boyfriends.

20:27.160 --> 20:31.440
Really, at twenty-two ?
You must have started pretty young.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.200
Sixteen.

20:33.920 --> 20:36.160
You had a boyfriend
when you sixteen years old ?

20:36.240 --> 20:42.400
Yeah. He's quite butch, isn't he ?
Kevin.

20:44.440 --> 20:47.120
He's not so butch
when he's got his legs in the air.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.200
Is he a hungry bottom ?

20:50.120 --> 20:53.800
- Super hungry.
- Oh, my god, that's awesome.

20:54.360 --> 20:56.720
So is he why you left
San Francisco ?

20:56.800 --> 20:59.680
Kevin, no, he's not getting
full credit for that.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.160
Then, why did you leave ?

21:02.240 --> 21:06.520
A lot of different reason.
To be honest,

21:06.600 --> 21:10.200
I sort of made a mess
of this other relationship

21:11.080 --> 21:13.160
with someone else I was with.

21:13.240 --> 21:16.440
- I'm sensing a theme.
- Yeah, exactly.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.320
Then after Kevin,
I realized what an idiot I'd been,

21:20.400 --> 21:24.600
but it was too late then.
That ship had sailed.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.800
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.240
It was actually the best thing
for both of us.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.640
And the truth is, even
if that ship hadn't sailed,

21:32.720 --> 21:34.280
I probably would have found a way
to sink it

21:34.360 --> 21:36.600
before it left the harbor, anyway.

21:36.680 --> 21:41.320
Yes, so then I went to Denver
and I swore myself off relationships

21:41.400 --> 21:45.200
which was probably better
for everyone in the long run.

21:47.680 --> 21:53.640
But it was also about
just being tired

21:53.720 --> 21:56.520
of my life not moving forward,
you know ?

21:56.600 --> 21:58.480
Or at least not moving
in the right direction.

21:58.560 --> 22:03.520
Going away was about pressing
the reset button and starting over.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.800
- Do you know what I mean ?
- Sure, yeah.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.880
- And, so ?
- So, what ?

22:18.360 --> 22:22.440
The reset, did it work ?

23:33.560 --> 23:36.520
- Hey, lazy bones.
- Hi.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.880
You could
have slept in your old bed.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.280
Wasn't that Jake guy in there ?

23:42.360 --> 23:43.920
No, of course not.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.000
Thank you.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.720
And Agustin's at Eddie's place,
you could have slept in his room.

23:49.800 --> 23:53.440
- I'm not getting in those sheets.
- I don't blame you.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.640
What time is it ?

23:54.720 --> 23:58.160
It's the afternoon.
I gotta go to work.

23:58.240 --> 24:02.560
- You can come if you want.
- I want to see the window.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.120
And that way you can tell me

24:04.200 --> 24:07.840
all the disgusting things
you did to that poor child.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.440
I rimmed him, he rimmed me.
I fucked him, he fucked me.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.800
It was very democratic.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.680
I'm loving all this sex positive
sex you've been having lately.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.480
Are you sure
it doesn't make me a slut ?

24:24.560 --> 24:27.720
- Does it make you feel positive ?
- Most of the time.

24:27.800 --> 24:33.000
- There you go.
- Then, afterwards, I don't know.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.480
- What happened ?
- Nothing happened.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.160
Then what ?

24:38.240 --> 24:41.120
I don't know, maybe it's that
I went away to Colorado

24:41.200 --> 24:43.360
and everything was out
of sight and out of mind,

24:43.440 --> 24:46.120
and now I'm back,
and then there it all is.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.240
There what is ?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.200
Everything I thought
I'd dealt with.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.280
Do you think I should see Kevin
while I'm here ?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.040
Why would you even think
about doing that ?

24:54.120 --> 24:57.600
Just to close the chapter,
bury the dead.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.920
See if he's gotten fat and gross.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.960
Just assume he's gotten
fat and gross, and move on.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.200
You're right.

25:05.320 --> 25:10.440
I forgot that you have a parklet !
Holy shit. It looks so good !

25:10.520 --> 25:11.520
Right ?

25:11.600 --> 25:14.480
If this doesn't mean you've made it I
don't know what does.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.320
Hi !

25:16.400 --> 25:18.320
Is it bring your daughter
to work day ?

25:18.400 --> 25:19.760
What are you doing here ?

25:19.840 --> 25:22.880
I came to talk to you. I didn't come
to talk to you. Go home.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.480
- I'm sorry, I can go home.
- No, it's fine. Please.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.880
Does anybody have a donut ?
I'm starving.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.080
And what do you do for a
hangover ? And I want to throw up.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.800
And he was totally into Dom, too.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.720
He was, great.
And, was he nice ?

25:35.800 --> 25:36.800
He was very nice.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.280
So did you fuck him ?
Is he gonna move in with you ?

25:39.360 --> 25:40.920
Help you clean the grease stains
off your aprons ?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.560
No to both of those,

25:42.640 --> 25:45.000
and do we really need to have
this conversation again ?

25:45.080 --> 25:47.880
We're having it again, how can that
be ? I haven't seen you in months.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.760
- I saw you last night.
- That didn't count.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.880
That was before you ran home for a
hot bubble bath and an early night.

25:52.960 --> 25:57.160
I don't get to stay out to all hours
just enjoying myself, any more.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.760
That never used to stop you.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.320
Not that I'm taking Doris's side,

26:00.400 --> 26:02.640
but why didn't you have sex
with Jake ?

26:02.720 --> 26:05.800
He lives in Chicago.
It would just be sex.

26:06.240 --> 26:08.360
I want to keep my focus clear.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.440
I don't want to complicate
things right now.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.400
Complicate. That doesn't mean
you gotta turn

26:12.480 --> 26:15.000
into Sister Dominic
of the Tenderloin.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.600
That should be the name
for the second window.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.360
This is so what he's like, Patrick.
This is what I have to deal with.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.240
The only thing he ever
thinks about is work.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.680
Is that so bad right now ?

26:24.760 --> 26:27.080
I think that all we're saying
is it's ok have a little fun.

26:27.160 --> 26:30.360
Get your hands on some skin that
doesn't belong to a plucked chicken.

26:30.440 --> 26:36.560
I appreciate the concern,
but I'm fine.

26:38.520 --> 26:42.960
I know what it is that I want,
and better still,

26:43.080 --> 26:45.960
I can see a way of getting it.
I got some purpose.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.960
- And sex could risk that ?
- Or maybe even a relationship ?

26:49.040 --> 26:50.680
Very possibly.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.600
I don't want to sound

26:53.680 --> 26:58.720
like one of those gross
couple relationship evangelist thing

26:59.520 --> 27:01.560
but you liked being with Lynn.

27:01.640 --> 27:07.080
Yes, of course I did. But that's
not what I want right now.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.480
I don't want to compromise,

27:10.560 --> 27:13.000
and relationships
take a lot of compromise.

27:13.080 --> 27:15.160
- Can I say one thing ?
- Would it matter if I said no ?

27:15.240 --> 27:20.160
This is working,
you're not gonna fuck it up.

27:22.640 --> 27:26.000
I know the feeling.

27:26.480 --> 27:30.480
But I'm not my mom
and you're not your dad.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.800
I'm being... whatever.

27:37.160 --> 27:38.680
Hey.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.240
Yeah, I could do that.

27:44.240 --> 27:45.720
Yes.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.560
I'll meet you there.

27:47.640 --> 27:51.880
I will meet you there right now.
All right, I'll see you soon.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.640
Bye.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.840
Does anybody want to come
with me to Indian Rock ?

27:58.920 --> 28:02.200
I think that Agustin
might be having a crisis.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.120
Fuck no.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.880
- Not in a million years.
- God.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.440
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.760
You're so gonna get laid
smelling like that.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.920
Good, Patrick,
we're together again.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.280
What happened ?
You seemed so calm yesterday.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.240
I was calm, and then I woke up
this morning

28:25.320 --> 28:26.920
with this pain in my stomach,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.400
like, I had an ulcer
that was about to burst.

28:29.480 --> 28:32.200
It's a stressful thing
you're doing getting married.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.440
I guess.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.720
You're getting committed
to somebody else.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.040
I don't think your choice
of vocabulary's helping.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.680
- Do you love him ?
- Do I love him ?

28:41.760 --> 28:43.480
Do you love Eddie ?

28:43.560 --> 28:45.600
I always used to say
that love is a social construct

28:45.680 --> 28:47.080
that doesn't really exist.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.080
I didn't believe you then
and I don't believe you now.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.160
- So, what is it ?
- Christ, don't ask me.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.600
Seriously, how would you define it ?

28:56.120 --> 28:58.680
Let me ask a different question.

28:58.760 --> 29:03.240
Does the idea of being with Eddie
make you happy ?

29:03.320 --> 29:05.800
Like, the two of you getting
old and grey together,

29:05.880 --> 29:08.680
smoking weed
to ease the arthritis.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.040
That thought does makes me happy.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.400
Why ?

29:14.640 --> 29:16.080
I don't know.

29:16.160 --> 29:19.720
I like his beard.
I like his hat collection.

29:19.800 --> 29:23.320
I like that whenever
I have someone I wanna bitch about

29:23.400 --> 29:25.200
or there's something funny
that I see,

29:25.280 --> 29:28.800
he's the person I want to tell.
He's my best friend, I guess.

29:28.880 --> 29:31.320
I'm mildly jealous
that I'm no longer your best friend.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.360
Okay, he's my best friend
that I wanna have sex with.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.480
- Also, he has a huge penis.
- Isn't that everything ?

29:37.560 --> 29:40.480
Not the penis part, obviously,
but the other stuff ?

29:40.560 --> 29:42.760
Maybe if you just focus on that,

29:42.840 --> 29:45.400
this won't
seem like such a big deal.

29:48.400 --> 29:52.640
Actually, I don't even think
this is about Eddie.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.200
This isn't like
some runaway bride moment

29:55.280 --> 29:58.000
where I feel like there's
someone else out there for me.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.640
Then what is it ?

30:01.280 --> 30:04.520
Remember when we first came here
after we started college ?

30:04.600 --> 30:08.720
- Of course.
- We talked about our big life plan.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.560
Among other things.

30:11.640 --> 30:13.840
If you had told me
then that a decade later

30:13.920 --> 30:17.360
I'd be working at the Art Institute
as a shop manager

30:17.440 --> 30:19.480
and getting hitched to a man, I...

30:19.560 --> 30:21.520
What did you know about
anything in those days ?

30:21.600 --> 30:23.640
We couldn't even
get married back then.

30:23.720 --> 30:28.480
You heard those guys last night.
Frank, especially him. Dom. Brady.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.200
Don't listen to anything Brady says.

30:30.280 --> 30:34.240
He's like a blog that nobody reads,
but in human form.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.520
But those guys were right.
I used to think

30:36.600 --> 30:40.200
that I would be like Keith Herring,
or Robert Mapplethorpe.

30:41.200 --> 30:44.440
But instead,
I've become Neil Patrick Harris.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.440
Only not as cool,
'cause I can't tap dance.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.560
- You can learn.
- I'm being serious.

30:50.640 --> 30:54.640
I'm not who I thought I'd be,
and it's tough for me to take.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.960
I've become everything
that I rallied against for years.

30:57.040 --> 30:59.160
- Very loudly.
- You're allowed to change.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.240
Especially when you've found
something that works for you.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.040
But what happens if I get
married and I freak out ?

31:04.120 --> 31:06.080
Not about Eddie
but about me.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.600
What happens if I can't cope
that this new me is so far

31:08.680 --> 31:11.640
from who I thought I would be
that I fuck everything up ?

31:11.720 --> 31:16.880
What happens if I hurt Eddie ?
I don't want to to him.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.320
What makes you think
you'll do that ?

31:18.400 --> 31:20.200
Because it's what I do,
for fuck's sake.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.680
Before you know it,
I'll be on the phone with CJ

31:22.760 --> 31:24.360
and I'll get him and a couple
of other rent boys

31:24.440 --> 31:26.840
to fuck Eddie just so I could
feel better about myself.

31:26.920 --> 31:30.360
I doubt that very much. I think
you learned your lesson there.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.960
Did I ?

31:35.840 --> 31:39.960
You know what I love ?
Over the last couple years,

31:40.680 --> 31:42.600
when you found that something
didn't work for you,

31:42.680 --> 31:48.360
you somehow found a way to fix it.
And that made you happy, right ?

31:49.080 --> 31:50.080
I suppose.

31:50.160 --> 31:53.200
You are happier now
than you've ever been.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.400
Not in this particular moment,
obviously,

31:55.480 --> 31:58.000
but who cares if you aren't you
who thought you were gonna be

31:58.080 --> 32:01.960
when you were eighteen years old.
You have had ten years of experience

32:02.040 --> 32:05.680
to figure out what it is
you really need.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.480
That's well said.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.600
And you know what ? This is not
a Katherine Heigl movie. Fuck her.

32:13.680 --> 32:16.960
This is your Sigourney Weaver
Alien trilogy.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.440
You've got so much left to go.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.600
You could even start up
your art practice again.

32:22.680 --> 32:26.320
Now that's a scary thought.
Scarier than the alien.

32:26.840 --> 32:31.560
That's true. Forget I said that last
part, but you know what I mean.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.720
I miss you.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.840
I miss you, too.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.920
We're just like Julianne Moore
and Annette Benning

32:53.000 --> 32:55.120
in The Kids are All Right.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.800
- Totally.
- Who am I ?

32:58.240 --> 33:00.520
Annette Benning, obviously.

33:02.240 --> 33:04.960
You're sleeping with him,
aren't you ?

33:07.440 --> 33:10.800
Dom, do you think things
would have been different for me

33:10.880 --> 33:12.680
if I came out when I was sixteen ?

33:12.760 --> 33:15.320
- Different how ?
- I don't know, just different.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.320
More adjusted,
like Jimmy from the other night,

33:17.400 --> 33:20.360
or better at being
in relationships, maybe ?

33:20.440 --> 33:22.400
I thought you didn't want
a relationship.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.280
Maybe I was kidding myself
just a little bit.

33:25.360 --> 33:28.280
- At least you admit it.
- So, what do you think ?

33:28.360 --> 33:30.720
I may not be the best person
to ask about relationships,

33:30.800 --> 33:32.320
since my history
is with a meth-head

33:32.400 --> 33:34.880
and an old dude in love
with a dead guy.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.400
But maybe it's not worth
thinking about.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.680
You can't go back in time.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.200
Maybe everything would've taken
a very different turn

33:43.280 --> 33:45.560
if you had managed to shoehorn
your dick into my butt

33:45.640 --> 33:47.040
all those years ago.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.680
Seriously ?

33:48.760 --> 33:51.720
I would've gotten over
my anal sex fear a lot earlier.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.280
Probably a lot of other fears, too.

33:53.360 --> 33:57.120
Remember in the movie 2012 when
California sank into the Pacific ?

33:57.200 --> 33:58.520
You really think
it would've been that bad ?

33:58.600 --> 34:02.040
Yes. And plus we never
would've become best friends,

34:02.120 --> 34:04.200
and that would've
been a real shame.

34:04.280 --> 34:07.760
That's true. I am glad that
you're my best friend, now,

34:07.840 --> 34:11.400
especially
since Agustin's out of the picture.

34:16.520 --> 34:19.440
So, what if we got together now ?

34:19.520 --> 34:23.639
Sure. I don't want a relationship,
but for you, I'll make a exception.

34:23.719 --> 34:26.840
Oh, come on. It's not
the worst idea in the world.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.280
- It's up there.
- You just said we're best friends.

34:29.360 --> 34:33.440
And that is the perfect basis
for a relationship.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.560
- Says who ?
- Says Agustin.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.560
What the hell does he know ?

34:42.960 --> 34:47.120
We don't make each other sick

34:47.920 --> 34:50.719
physically, right ?

34:52.080 --> 34:55.880
- Do I make you sick ?
- It depends on what I've eaten.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.840
I don't know, I mean, maybe
this has been staring us in the face

34:59.920 --> 35:01.520
the whole time.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.520
You are actually scaring me
right now.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.880
We understand and accept
each other's flaws.

35:12.960 --> 35:16.320
Your work is important to you
as mine is to me.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.280
We like the same movies.
On paper...

35:19.360 --> 35:23.400
Would you stop laughing ?
On paper, it sounds totally right.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.680
You are not being serious.

35:32.640 --> 35:34.200
- Not really.
- Okay, good.

35:34.280 --> 35:36.320
But it would be nice, wouldn't it ?

35:38.400 --> 35:41.600
To suddenly find something
by mistake that makes sense.

35:41.680 --> 35:48.520
That makes it all easier.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.120
What just happened ?

36:18.200 --> 36:19.320
- I kissed you.
- Why ?

36:19.400 --> 36:24.320
I don't know, I felt like it.
I wanted to see if you were right.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.120
And you looked a little sad.

36:29.760 --> 36:33.000
- How did it feel ?
- A little bit weird, if I'm honest.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.120
Kind of like
kissing your brother ?

36:36.440 --> 36:38.520
I can't believe we did that.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.280
My god.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.320
- I think maybe I'm a little stoned.
- Yeah, me, too.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.160
We should sleep.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.320
I'm sorry I made you make out
with me.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.640
You did say you wanted me
to have some fun.

36:54.720 --> 36:56.320
So fun.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.400
Go again ?

37:09.360 --> 37:13.640
Oh, god. So hard to know whether
you're doing the right thing.

37:13.720 --> 37:18.080
Yes. So, what's the answer ?

37:19.600 --> 37:21.320
Who the fuck knows ?

37:22.720 --> 37:25.840
Although, maybe you were right
this morning.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.600
- About what ?
- About closing a chapter.

37:31.120 --> 37:35.120
It's so easy to let the past
make a mess of the present.

37:36.840 --> 37:40.280
You should try not
to let that happen, just FYI.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.280
This is a surprise.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.960
- You're blonde.
- Yeah, I'm blonde.

39:34.040 --> 39:37.400
- And you had your hair cut, too.
- You look well.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.680
You didn't need to dress up.

39:40.240 --> 39:43.320
Agustin's getting married, today,
actually, so...

39:43.400 --> 39:44.680
- To Eddie ?
- Yeah.

39:44.760 --> 39:47.480
Fuck. I never put money
on that lasting.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.360
Love is a mysterious game,
I guess.

39:53.840 --> 39:57.400
- You look well, too, by the way.
- Thank you.

39:58.040 --> 40:00.360
Should we just stand here and tell
each other how well we look,

40:00.440 --> 40:03.160
or should we go get that coffee
and explain why you texted me ?

40:03.240 --> 40:05.720
- Let's do that.
- I'm thinking this way.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.000
- Cool ?
- Yes, let's do it.

40:09.480 --> 40:13.480
So, how's Denver ?
I love what you guys are doing.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.040
It's good.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.920
I hear you're finally heading
your own chain. That's a good thing.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.440
That's something that should've
happened a long time ago.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.800
Thanks.

40:23.880 --> 40:28.400
Word of advice. Don't go falling
for any of your subordinates.

40:30.000 --> 40:37.000
I'll try my best. How's MDG ?
And Owen ? I haven't really talk...

40:37.160 --> 40:40.840
Talked to them, I know.
He's good. He's been promoted.

40:40.920 --> 40:44.480
- Meredith, she finally came out.
- What ?

40:44.560 --> 40:47.120
I'm kidding. Here.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.000
Thank you.

40:53.320 --> 40:56.760
You look different.
Not completely different, but...

40:59.720 --> 41:01.560
I lost a little weight,
maybe it's that, right ?

41:01.640 --> 41:03.960
Maybe. I've piled on the pounds.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.800
John finally embraced
my love of fried chicken.

41:06.880 --> 41:10.320
- John ?
- We got back together.

41:10.760 --> 41:12.720
Really ?

41:13.120 --> 41:15.240
Does that surprise you ?

41:15.840 --> 41:18.920
I donno. Maybe not.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.240
Do you know what, in many ways,
what happened between us

41:21.320 --> 41:23.360
was a good thing.
The break-up...

41:23.440 --> 41:26.280
- The large, filtered, tall, black ?
- That's me. Thank you.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.600
The whole thing has just made me
think about what I wanted,

41:28.680 --> 41:30.480
what I needed in a relationship
to make it work,

41:30.560 --> 41:32.840
so in many ways, I'm quite thankful
that you came into my life

41:32.920 --> 41:36.160
and fucked it up
'cause it's better, now.

41:37.600 --> 41:39.200
I don't really know how
to answer that.

41:39.280 --> 41:43.760
John and me are actually,
we're actually really good.

41:43.840 --> 41:47.200
We had some therapy, which
I would highly recommend for you.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.880
You're not the first person
to suggest that.

41:49.960 --> 41:55.280
Not surprising. We came to fully
understand our wants and our needs.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.360
You've been here too long,

41:57.440 --> 41:59.240
you're even starting
to sound like an American.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.080
Large, soy milk iced coffee ?

42:01.160 --> 42:03.960
If I meet Chris Pratt
down at Fitness First

42:04.040 --> 42:07.920
I can jerk him off to my heart's
content and that's completely fine.

42:09.160 --> 42:13.080
I'm happy for you and John.
And Chris Pratt.

42:13.160 --> 42:15.000
I don't a-hundred percent
believe that.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.480
It's not like I ever wanted you
to be miserable.

42:18.560 --> 42:23.320
I'm glad it worked out for you.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.480
Shall we sit ?

42:33.040 --> 42:37.200
Basically, I want to hand over
all rights to you for the app.

42:37.280 --> 42:41.400
Okay. We didn't need
to meet for that.

42:41.480 --> 42:45.840
I know, but it's better
to do it like this.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.360
I could have a guy draw up
a document, but I feel like...

42:48.440 --> 42:51.040
- What if it makes a fortune ?
- It's hardly Minecraft.

42:51.120 --> 42:54.720
Okay, but it could still
end up making us some money.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.360
Stereotyped, cliche-ridden dross.

42:57.920 --> 43:01.080
Or my personal favorite,
what the fuck is the point ?

43:01.160 --> 43:02.680
Why do you read what people say ?

43:02.760 --> 43:05.320
- Don't you ?
- Yeah, but I don't care.

43:05.400 --> 43:08.160
Anyway, making money
was never the point.

43:08.240 --> 43:10.480
What was the point ?

43:12.640 --> 43:18.600
I feel like it doesn't make sense
for us to do it anymore.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.360
Together.

43:23.560 --> 43:26.040
Okay, I'm gonna ask you something.

43:26.120 --> 43:29.200
Were you ever actually in love
with me ?

43:33.400 --> 43:36.560
Yes, I think so.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.880
I certainly
loved the idea of us...

43:39.960 --> 43:42.240
'Cause I could've made it work.

43:42.320 --> 43:46.520
When I said I wanted to
be monogamous with you, I meant it.

43:46.600 --> 43:50.200
I didn't want you to make a promise
you couldn't keep.

43:50.280 --> 43:53.160
Fuck you. How do you know
I wouldn't keep it ?

43:53.240 --> 43:55.040
That's not why we broke up, we
just weren't right for each other.

43:55.120 --> 43:57.880
- No, how do you know that ?
- I did, I do.

43:57.960 --> 44:02.080
You didn't even try, you moved
in one day, you moved out the next.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.280
You didn't even unpack.

44:03.360 --> 44:06.920
I admit that I handled that
horribly, but I apologized for that.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.880
And isn't it better to quit
rather than drag out something

44:10.960 --> 44:13.480
that you know won't work ?

44:13.960 --> 44:16.760
In a nutshell, there's your problem.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.400
What is ?

44:22.480 --> 44:27.400
You quit, you run away,
you don't take risks, ever.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.240
What are you talking about,
I moved in with you.

44:29.320 --> 44:32.800
No, no, Patrick, the risk would've
been trying to make it work.

44:32.880 --> 44:35.600
The risk would've been putting in
hard graft to make it work.

44:35.680 --> 44:39.800
I don't want to seem
like a cunt, but you are a coward.

44:39.880 --> 44:43.720
I don't think that's fair.
I couldn't trust you, any more.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.240
And I don't know
what hard graft means,

44:46.320 --> 44:47.760
but I don't think
I've been a coward, at all.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.920
I think the facts tell
a very different story.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.600
Would a coward have moved
to a different city, a new job,

44:52.680 --> 44:54.640
left everything behind ?

44:55.200 --> 44:58.800
You basically moved home.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.520
Are you sure you didn't run away,
and not move away ?

45:01.600 --> 45:05.640
They're two very different things.
What next for Patrick Murray ?

45:06.160 --> 45:08.120
When that doesn't work out,
I bet you a million dollars

45:08.200 --> 45:10.520
you're already looking
for the next thing.

45:10.600 --> 45:15.760
You are. I know you.
You run away and you are a coward.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.680
You were a coward with me,
you were a coward with Richard.

45:18.760 --> 45:21.040
You come across a few potholes
in the road,

45:21.120 --> 45:22.520
and instead of trying to navigate
through it,

45:22.600 --> 45:25.160
you slam your brakes on,
and you run the other direction.

45:25.240 --> 45:28.560
I did not come here
to get nailed to the cross.

45:28.640 --> 45:31.320
So, why did you come here, then ?

45:31.760 --> 45:35.960
Honestly, and please
don't use the app as an excuse.

45:36.720 --> 45:39.120
I came here to close a chapter.

45:39.200 --> 45:41.480
To see if we could move forward
from this.

45:41.560 --> 45:44.080
To become friends ?
Is that what you want ?

45:44.160 --> 45:46.920
Why don't you come over to my house,
and then we can have a barbecue,

45:47.000 --> 45:49.280
me, you, and John ?

45:53.720 --> 45:59.680
Do you really think that you
and me could ever be friends ?

46:06.920 --> 46:10.040
No, sadly.

46:16.800 --> 46:20.560
Sorry. I really didn't want it
to be like that.

46:22.440 --> 46:25.800
- I shouldn't have texted.
- It's a good thing.

46:25.880 --> 46:27.800
It needed to be done.

46:29.160 --> 46:32.240
Just draw the contract,
I'll sign it.

46:32.680 --> 46:36.840
Thinking about it, it's probably
the right thing for me, too.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.840
Kevin,

46:44.240 --> 46:47.520
do you honestly think
we would've worked ?

46:51.280 --> 46:53.960
I'd like to have given it a try.

47:08.520 --> 47:10.240
I wasn't gonna tell you this,

47:10.320 --> 47:14.080
but seeing as I'm gonna make
a fortune off One Up 'Em...

47:14.160 --> 47:16.040
Tell me what ?

47:16.280 --> 47:18.400
I know of a job position
coming here,

47:18.480 --> 47:20.880
that you'd be good for, in S.F.

47:22.680 --> 47:24.680
At MDG ?

47:25.320 --> 47:30.680
Don't worry, I'm not gonna be there.
John and I are moving to London.

47:32.280 --> 47:33.360
Really ?

47:33.440 --> 47:37.280
Got a job offer there, and I've been
been missing home a lot.

47:37.360 --> 47:38.560
Are you done with San Francisco ?

47:38.640 --> 47:40.960
If that's something that you'd be
interested in, I can make it happen,

47:41.040 --> 47:44.640
but I have to warn you:
Owen will hate you.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.440
But, he will also love
to have you back, so...

47:52.560 --> 47:55.040
Why would you do that for me ?

47:55.920 --> 47:59.480
Seriously, after... everything.

47:59.560 --> 48:03.840
Because, despite everything,
I just want you to be happy.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.400
Why ?

48:08.040 --> 48:10.600
Why ? 'Cause I love you.

48:16.320 --> 48:19.160
Look, don't stay in Denver.
Come back,

48:19.240 --> 48:21.640
and you can take that from someone
who moves around constantly

48:21.720 --> 48:23.880
to avoid dealing with things.
It never works.

48:23.960 --> 48:27.040
But I think you know that already.

48:29.160 --> 48:33.880
If you're interested, email me.
We don't need to talk, okay ?

48:35.960 --> 48:37.600
One last hug ?

49:19.960 --> 49:21.560
Oh, shit.

49:51.400 --> 49:53.080
Sorry I'm late,
there was trouble...

49:53.160 --> 49:56.640
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah, I'm fine, are you good ?

49:57.320 --> 49:59.240
- Don't worry.
- Where's Eddie ?

49:59.320 --> 50:02.000
He's using the toilet
for the eleventh time.

50:02.080 --> 50:06.200
I'm getting married to an old lady.
Where the fuck is he ?

50:07.760 --> 50:10.320
Hurry up !
We're gonna lose our spot in line.

50:10.400 --> 50:12.720
It's like every fucker in the city's
getting married.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.080
I nearly got run over by a stampede
of bride's maids.

50:15.160 --> 50:17.320
- Why don't we have bride's maids ?
- You have us.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.200
I'm Italian, for Christ's sake.
This is gonna be the smallest

50:19.280 --> 50:20.960
Italian wedding
in the history of time.

50:21.040 --> 50:23.800
This is just paperwork.
We're gonna party tonight.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.800
Yeah, then why am I wearing this ?

50:25.880 --> 50:28.560
Wearing what ? You're
not wearing a wedding dress.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.160
Maybe I should be.

50:30.240 --> 50:32.200
And maybe we should be getting
married in a church,

50:32.280 --> 50:34.760
giving thanks to the great white man
in the sky for our love.

50:34.840 --> 50:35.920
That's not what I said.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.320
We're not doing this
for other people,

50:37.400 --> 50:39.600
we're not doing this
for our parents,

50:39.680 --> 50:42.040
we're doing this for us.
That's what we discussed.

50:42.120 --> 50:45.440
Shouldn't my mother be here ?
Otherwise, why are we doing this ?

50:46.840 --> 50:50.120
Oh, my god.
Why are we doing this at all ?

50:50.200 --> 50:53.360
Can we at least check in ?

50:53.440 --> 50:55.120
I have to toilet again,
and this time it's not pee-pee.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.280
No, hold it in okay ?
You have a powerful sphincter.

51:00.120 --> 51:02.760
I'll meet you guys up there.
Jake, can we get mama on FaceTime ?

51:02.840 --> 51:04.720
- Yes.
- I got this.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.640
We should man the exits.
Eddie is surprisingly fast.

51:07.720 --> 51:09.240
He's not gonna do that, is he ?

51:09.320 --> 51:11.080
He's had that look
in his eyes before.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.800
I think Agustin's
gonna figure it out.

51:12.880 --> 51:15.440
- Where were you ?
- Nowhere.

51:15.520 --> 51:18.640
- So, why do you look so...
- I look fine.

51:18.720 --> 51:21.160
- Shit, I need to pee, now.
- Really ?

51:21.240 --> 51:22.800
So do I.

51:24.200 --> 51:26.800
What ? I really do.

51:27.160 --> 51:29.960
You guys pee,
and I'll meet you up there.

51:35.640 --> 51:39.320
... by the state of California,
I pronounce you partners for life.

51:39.400 --> 51:41.080
Now you may kiss.

51:58.720 --> 52:03.280
Hello.
Sorry, I think that we're next.

52:03.360 --> 52:06.560
- Are you Rankin or Lanwise ?
- No, I'm not getting married.

52:06.640 --> 52:10.200
It's my friends,
but they'll just be a minute.

52:10.720 --> 52:13.480
- Last minute nerves ?
- Something like that.

52:13.560 --> 52:16.880
It's very common. I wouldn't worry.

52:18.640 --> 52:21.040
Those two have been together
for 45 years.

52:21.120 --> 52:23.560
- That's amazing.
- Yes, it is.

52:27.960 --> 52:31.040
- Can I ask you something ?
- Of course.

52:31.120 --> 52:33.320
How long have you been doing this ?

52:33.400 --> 52:36.520
A very long time.
Some people would say too long.

52:36.600 --> 52:41.800
And are you able to tell
if it's gonna work or not ?

52:42.640 --> 52:46.960
Sometimes, maybe I can tell who
wants it more than the other one,

52:47.040 --> 52:51.320
who's gotten real and who's head
is still in the clouds.

52:51.400 --> 52:54.680
Who's willing
or unwilling to adapt.

52:56.200 --> 53:02.280
And, do you really think that people
can change for each other ?

53:03.480 --> 53:07.880
I prefer adapt to change.
It's a little more realistic.

53:07.960 --> 53:11.920
Plus I read somewhere that
every part of us has something to do

53:12.000 --> 53:16.200
with the part that came before.
Does that sound corny ?

53:17.400 --> 53:18.640
Works for me.

53:18.720 --> 53:21.320
Maybe that's why we keep making
the same mistakes.

53:21.400 --> 53:23.080
Probably.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.560
How long have you been married ?

53:27.520 --> 53:32.320
- Between you and me, not married.
- But, your ring.

53:32.400 --> 53:37.120
It's a prop. Nobody wants
a fat trainer at the gym.

53:39.880 --> 53:42.600
- You all set ?
- Yes.

53:42.680 --> 53:44.360
- Lanwise ?
- I got it.

53:44.440 --> 53:46.360
Oh, it's my mom.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.360
I'm sorry I think we'll just be
one more minute.

53:49.440 --> 53:52.800
- Sure. Take your time.
- Is everything all right ?

53:52.880 --> 53:55.280
- It is, now.
- What'd you say ?

53:55.360 --> 53:59.880
Let's just say he's a big Sigourney
Weaver fan, so thank you for that.

53:59.960 --> 54:03.240
It was my pleasure. That's
what maids of dishonor are for.

54:03.320 --> 54:07.240
I just hope that this marriage
can be whatever we want it to be.

54:07.320 --> 54:09.960
Exactly. It's not like you're
just gonna suddenly be monogamous

54:10.040 --> 54:11.320
and move to the suburbs.

54:11.400 --> 54:16.320
No. And then, I love him,
and he loves me,

54:16.840 --> 54:18.240
so what's the worst
that could happen ?

54:18.320 --> 54:21.280
It doesn't work out, it doesn't
work out, but, at least we tried.

54:21.360 --> 54:23.480
Let's fuckin' do this.

54:35.960 --> 54:37.120
You got it all done, right ?

54:37.200 --> 54:39.080
Great, perfect, and if you would
just take a look at that

54:39.160 --> 54:42.200
and make sure they're saying
everything they want to say.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.400
Edward, you have chosen Agustin
to be your partner in life.

54:45.480 --> 54:47.880
Will you strive to love
and respect him always,

54:47.960 --> 54:51.680
be honest and kind and stand by him,
whatever may come ?

54:52.200 --> 54:53.200
I do.

54:53.280 --> 54:56.360
Agustin, you've chosen Edward
to be your partner in life.

54:56.440 --> 54:58.560
Will you strive to love
and respect him always,

54:58.640 --> 55:02.520
be honest and kind and stand by him,
whatever may come ?

55:02.600 --> 55:04.920
I do. Yes.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.520
And do you both promise to make
the necessary adjustments

55:07.600 --> 55:09.360
in your personal
and professional lives

55:09.440 --> 55:13.320
in order that you may live in a
harmonious relationship together ?

55:13.400 --> 55:15.360
We do.

55:16.360 --> 55:18.120
And as much as you, Edward,
and you, Agustin,

55:18.200 --> 55:21.000
have pledged your love to each
other in front of these witnesses,

55:21.080 --> 55:23.640
by the power vested in me
by the state of California,

55:23.720 --> 55:26.560
I pronounce you
partners in life.

55:28.200 --> 55:29.640
Now you may kiss.

55:35.040 --> 55:36.560
My god.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.400
Now what ?

55:38.560 --> 55:42.880
Now we get drunk and we take a lot
of fuckin' drugs. Sorry, mom.

56:17.000 --> 56:22.120
- Hey, there. How'd it go ?
- It was really sweet.

56:24.120 --> 56:26.080
Agustin didn't freak out ?

56:26.160 --> 56:29.800
Yesterday, but not today. Eddie,
though, that was a close call.

56:29.880 --> 56:31.280
Really ?

56:33.720 --> 56:36.720
It's so easy
to disregard all of this,

56:36.800 --> 56:39.680
being able to get married stuff,
and what it means,

56:39.760 --> 56:41.920
but when we were in city hall,
today, in public,

56:42.000 --> 56:45.720
in front of total strangers,
I don't know,

56:45.800 --> 56:47.960
in a few years,
this is all just gonna be normal,

56:48.040 --> 56:49.840
it'll just be a way of life
and that's great,

56:49.920 --> 56:56.080
but for us, and for all those people
that came before us,

56:56.360 --> 56:59.640
that actually had to struggle
against something,

57:00.200 --> 57:03.400
it's just pretty fucking
incredible, right ?

57:03.480 --> 57:04.760
It is.

57:04.840 --> 57:09.080
And you can't help but feel,
I don't know, validated,

57:09.160 --> 57:12.840
even though I know we shouldn't
need that validation.

57:12.920 --> 57:15.880
I guess just because you feel
you shouldn't need something,

57:15.960 --> 57:17.960
doesn't mean you don't.

57:21.200 --> 57:23.120
Hi, Paddy-cakes.

57:25.160 --> 57:28.080
- Sorry I didn't get you one.
- It's okay.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.120
What are we talking about ?

57:30.200 --> 57:34.240
Just how great it is.
Them getting married.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.760
Champagne ?

57:48.840 --> 57:52.280
Could I please get a tequila ?
Thank you.

57:54.240 --> 57:57.760
- Have you seen Dom ?
- He's around here somewhere.

57:59.240 --> 58:03.280
I've already made a round of...
I so know that look.

58:03.360 --> 58:05.520
Weddings are awful, aren't they ?
They're horrible.

58:05.600 --> 58:09.560
You have to take solace in knowing
that it's gonna end in divorce.

58:09.640 --> 58:11.320
Malik seems to be enjoying himself.

58:11.400 --> 58:14.200
I know ! He's dancing
with a bunch of bears.

58:14.280 --> 58:17.000
Should I be worried ?
It looks like he's having fun.

58:17.080 --> 58:19.720
Are you sure you don't wanna lock
that down with a wedding ring ?

58:19.800 --> 58:23.160
Wedding rings don't do shit.
Babies, on the other hand,

58:23.240 --> 58:25.960
so much harder
to flush down the toilet.

58:26.040 --> 58:27.680
What ?

58:27.760 --> 58:31.040
What ? I'm so drunk, y'all.
What'd I say ?

58:31.120 --> 58:34.800
- Oh, my god, are you...
- No ! I'm not...

58:34.880 --> 58:39.960
I wouldn't be drinking if I was.
If I was my mother I would be.

58:40.040 --> 58:44.120
- You are, aren't you ?
- No, I'm not, okay ?

58:44.200 --> 58:46.760
But, okay, Sherlock Homo.

58:46.840 --> 58:50.280
Malik and me
we're talking about having a baby.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.040
Doris, this is incredible news !

58:53.120 --> 58:54.920
- Oh, god, is it ?
- Yeah !

58:55.000 --> 58:57.240
You don't think I'm this big,
old cliché who has incredible news ?

58:57.320 --> 59:00.400
Cliché ? No. If you wanna have a
baby, you wanna have a baby, right ?

59:00.480 --> 59:03.960
- I guess.
- Does Dom know ?

59:04.040 --> 59:08.440
No, I was gonna tell him yesterday,
but then you ruined it.

59:11.120 --> 59:14.400
- Tell him !
- Shit, take it easy.

59:14.480 --> 59:19.320
You're making...  Malik and me
are talking about having a baby...

59:19.400 --> 59:22.760
I may not even be able to have one,
'cause I'm old.

59:22.840 --> 59:24.960
There's gonna be sand pouring
out of me.

59:25.040 --> 59:26.880
And if we have one, it's gonna
a have this weird chest hair.

59:26.960 --> 59:28.400
Are you kidding me ?

59:28.480 --> 59:31.000
No, I'm not kidding you.
We are talking about it.

59:32.640 --> 59:34.920
Unfortunately, it's not...

59:36.520 --> 59:39.520
- I'm gonna be an uncle ?
- Yep. You can be an guncle.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.160
Why didn't you tell me ?

59:41.240 --> 59:47.360
I don't know, because I thought
that if I was gonna have a baby

59:47.440 --> 59:50.280
I thought I was gonna have one
with you,

59:50.360 --> 59:54.040
and I'm not going
to be having one with you.

59:58.200 --> 01:00:01.640
- I know, it's just so...
- It's so much better !

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:05.840
You're spilling your beer
all over me, too.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.960
- That's just fucking amazing.
- Yeah, oh, the miracle of life.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.600
I'm not gonna get married.
So don't bring that up.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.520
It's gonna be a bastard child.
That's what we want,

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.120
and for god's sakes,
please let it be a gay baby.

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:20.960
With you as its mother, the poor
fuck doesn't have a choice.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.800
I know. But before I ruin my life,
I wanna do some drugs tonight.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.200
Pretend we're 25.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.800
Fuck yes. Handsome Jake
has some moon-rocks.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.040
Handsome Jake ?

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.800
Handsome Jake
is kind of weakening my resolve.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.600
This evening is going
to take a little turn.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.440
I thought it was gonna
be a nightmare.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.560
Wonderful, all right.
Let's do it.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.160
This does not last forever.
This feeling.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.280
I know exactly what you're feeling.
This whole misery thing it passes.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.440
If you want it to, it will.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.520
I'll talk to you later.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.080
Can I cut in ?

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.400
We need to tell our kids
every day that they are beautiful,

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.760
that their lives do matter,
that they deserve to be healthy

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.480
and happy and safe and loved.
That's what Eddie does.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:33.560
Eddie does that every day
when he goes to work.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.040
And that's why I love you,
Eddie,

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.040
I'm proud of you, I'm so happy
that you found a man.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.720
And thank you for inviting me
to be a part of this, tonight.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.720
Now where are those
maids of dishonor ?

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.680
Patrick, get your skinny ass
up here.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.480
You beautiful boys, here we go.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.480
I think everybody in this room

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.400
can agree that this is the most
surprising thing in the world,

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.240
but, at the same time,
it makes total sense, am I right ?

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.320
We love you, Paddy.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.480
This isn't about me, I'm not
gonna make this speech about me.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.720
Never gonna happen.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.440
I want to talk about Agustin.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.320
We have been friends
for a very long time.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.960
And there are a million reasons
why I love you.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.720
But one of them,
one of the biggest ones,

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:38.360
is that you have been always incredibly
committed

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.640
to making the most
of your life.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.520
And even when you fuck up,
and we all fuck up, right ?

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.880
You keep going despite any sort
of doubts that you might have,

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.640
and you keep trying to find
the things that work for you,

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.000
and you found Eddie, right ?

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.600
And it is really clear

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.040
that you two are absolutely
crazy about each other,

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:08.480
while at the same time being
incredibly realistic

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:12.200
about what that means,
and both being really committed

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.760
to figuring out
how to make that work.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.760
And I...

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.280
I just think that that is...

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.120
Amazing ! And so, before I start
openly weeping,

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.240
let's raise a cheap cocktail
to Agustin and Eddie !

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.440
To Eddie and Agustin !

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.080
That too. And now, everybody,
please welcome to the stage

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.960
my fellow maid of dishonor, Jake.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.040
Patrick, thank you,
that was beautiful.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.520
Excuse me.

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.160
Hey, guys.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.920
Better speech than last time.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.360
Couldn't really
have been any worse, right ?

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:11.480
Probably not.
I need another drink.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.960
Will you buy me another drink ?
I don't have any cash left.

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.360
You don't think
you've had enough ?

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.960
Big gay wedding, right ?
I want to get super drunk

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.360
so I can forget about how dull
we've all become.

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.320
Aren't you already super drunk ?

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:27.640
Less of the nagging fifties
housewife, please, okay ?

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.080
We aren't married.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.320
I always thought you'd be the wife.
You look so good in an apron.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400
What was that ?

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.840
It was just a joke. You called
him a nagging wife and I...

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.760
- You'd expect me to be the wife.
- It was just a joke, that's all.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.280
Is your fem-phobia a joke
all of a sudden ?

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.160
- Brady...
- What, I'm kidding.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.680
No, that's okay, you can say it.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.400
It's not the first time
you've implied

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.080
I'm everything that's wrong
with the gay community.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:56.480
I said you and Kevin were...

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:01.200
- What are we talking about ?
- About Patrick being a shitty gay.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.440
I love it when gays argue
with other gays about being gays.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.040
Brady thinks he's grand minister
of queer.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.160
The leader of the gay
thought police.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:14.440
It's called having a brain
and think about things.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.400
Both of you, enough.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.000
It's a little frustrating
that sometimes Brady thinks

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.880
there's only one way to be gay,
his way.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.680
I'm just sick of people like you
giving us a bad name, okay ?

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.520
You would think that if there
was such a thing as us,

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.200
there would be
a little more solidarity.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.280
- Maybe you don't deserve it.
- Brady, seriously, what the fuck ?

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.960
I will never understand why you're
so intent on making me feel bad,

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.680
because I can't live up
to some ideal

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.640
that I'll never live up to
because it just isn't who I am.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.680
If you feel bad,
it's probably not my fault.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.400
- Enough. Okay ?
- I'm sorry, Richie, you're right.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.560
Brady, I apologize.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.360
And I promise to read
more of your articles,

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:52.880
and hope that one day I can
finally learn how to be gay

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.960
and be as perfectly adjusted
as you.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.440
- Yeah, fuck you.
- Fuck you back !

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:58.960
That's it, we're out of here.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.280
- Why are you taking his side ?
- I'm not.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.760
- Why does it feel like you are ?
- This has nothing to do with sides.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.240
Then what is it about ?

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.480
This is about you being too drunk,

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.080
and this is a party for Eddie
and Agustin,

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.560
and has nothing to do
with how you feel about Patrick.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:18.120
- Or how he feels about you.
- Typical that you would take his...

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:23.920
You want to be with him ? After all
the shit he's put you through ?

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.560
Because I can guarantee

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.160
he will do nothing
but break your heart again.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.760
That your plan ?

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.560
You want to fly in here
on your private jet

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.040
and steal my fucking boyfriend ?

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:43.480
- Of course not.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.960
You're not gonna come, are you ?

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.680
Come on, let's go.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.160
- You okay, bud ?
- He's just jealous.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.240
Everyone can see
there's something between you.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.880
There's nothing between us.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.280
Yet I have managed to fuck things up
for him again.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.520
- That was totally not your fault.
- I could've just shut the fuck up.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:15.920
You all right ?

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.800
You have a private jet ?

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.479
How come you're so fuckin' cheap
if you have a private jet ?

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.680
That's a legitimate question.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.240
I didn't come here
to just ruin everybody's weekend.

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:28.000
Can we please just dance ?

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.200
Let's just all get on the dance
floor and dance.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.399
Let's do it !

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.440
I should tell you something.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.320
I'm thinking about leaving
San Francisco.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.160
What do you mean ?

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.360
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.040
You mean leaving,
like, for good ?

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.880
You did it.
You had the guts to do it.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.120
Yeah but I think I was
just running away.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.600
Who cares ? Sometimes, running
away is exactly what you need to do.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.080
But you were born here. This is
your home, you've always been here.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:31.320
Exactly.
Everyone else gets to come here.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:36.040
- I never had that.
- Where you gonna go ?

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.000
- I have some family in Texas.
- What are you gonna do in Texas ?

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.800
I could take the truck.
I can work.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.200
At least there I might get
to do more than just fades

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.280
and hipster bullshit.

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:51.920
Better not go to Austin, then.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.560
It's funny or ironic, that
you're thinking about leaving,

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.440
because just today,

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.480
I was offered a job back here.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.600
- Shit !
- What ?

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.600
- I don't want you to do that.
- What ?

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.960
Come back here.

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:23.560
I need to do this

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.040
and I don't need
the temptation to stay.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.840
I gotta get my head straight,
'cause it's all over the place.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.880
And there's so much
that I need to sort out.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.800
Like what ?

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.880
I've been in a relationship
for a year

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.920
with a guy
that I wasn't in love with.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:50.080
I think right now,
I just need to be alone.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.720
I get that.

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.320
I get your desire to be alone.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:01.920
That's what I've just done
for the last nine months.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.640
But at the same time,
being back here,

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.160
I've realized that being alone
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.560
- We aren't the same person.
- We're not that different either.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.000
Wouldn't you like to be
with someone

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.920
while you work through your shit ?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.280
Someone who understands you,
someone who cares about you ?

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:29.960
That way you have someone
to hang out with.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.600
You against the world.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:36.280
You've got someone
to make out with.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.600
Someone to sit on the sofa
and eat takeout with.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:48.640
Someone to get old and grey
and watch The Goonies with.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.640
Hey, you guys !

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:58.160
Oh, my god, you saw it !

01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.760
Twice.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.560
You saw it twice ?
Wow, you must have liked it.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:13.040
Okay, so, what are we gonna do ?

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.360
This is insane.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:21.280
I just broke up with Brady
not even two hours ago.

01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.080
We can't do this now.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:25.040
I know. And if you want me
to shut up, I will,

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:30.280
but if that's the case, then
why did you come back tonight ?

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:35.000
Why did you come back
to the Endup ?

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.960
What are you suggesting we do ?

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.560
I'm not going to Denver,
that's for sure,

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:48.000
and I really need
to get out of here.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:51.080
Then...

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:56.520
- How about I come to Texas ?
- What ?

01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:01.400
I'll come with you or I'll go there
after you've gotten settled.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.240
You have a job in Denver.
You have another job lined up here.

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.680
I can work remotely.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.680
I'll do my own thing.
I've always wanted to do that.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:14.280
Do they have computers in Texas ?

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:19.160
And what happens
when you've sobered up ?

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:25.560
When the wedding's over and
you've lost this sense of romance ?

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.840
- Is that what you're scared of ?
- Of course I am.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.040
I have met you.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:37.360
What happens when you freak out ?
Again.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:42.200
I am so sick of taking care
of people.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.320
I don't want to do that again.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:49.080
I don't need you to take care
of me, Richie. Okay, I don't.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:55.600
I want to be with you
while you figure out

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.720
whatever it is you need
to figure out.

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:06.080
You told me once that you were this
close to falling in love with me.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.440
I was in love with you back then,

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.640
I'm in love with you now,

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:16.200
except I was afraid
of that feeling.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.080
I'm not afraid anymore.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:28.600
What happens if it doesn't
work out ? What do we do then ?

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.880
If it doesn't work out, it doesn't
work out. But at least we tried.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:41.480
Do you want to try ?

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.080
Come in here !

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.480
This city drives me crazy,

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:17.160
but right now it feels like
the best place in the world.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.640
Yes, it does.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:22.160
These eggs are disgusting,
but they are so good.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.760
Is that the moon-rocks ?

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:27.640
I think you should come back.
What do you think, guys ?

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.040
Come back down from the mountains

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.040
and live with us
happily ever after.
