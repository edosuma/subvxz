WEBVTT

00:11.122 --> 00:14.183
Uh, Brick, what's with the getup?

00:14.208 --> 00:16.174
Oh, this?

00:16.175 --> 00:17.543
I've noticed high-school kids

00:17.545 --> 00:19.277
seem to be very into school pride.

00:19.279 --> 00:21.613
As you know,
I live life on the periphery,

00:21.615 --> 00:23.382
on the fringes of fun.

00:23.384 --> 00:25.116
But I've decided, if I want to graduate

00:25.118 --> 00:26.918
having lived the highschool experience,

00:26.920 --> 00:29.621
it will require total immersion.

00:29.623 --> 00:31.922
But you don't even like sports.

00:31.924 --> 00:34.091
Correction... used to not like sports.

00:34.093 --> 00:35.226
Now all I care about

00:35.228 --> 00:37.695
is we beat the Bentonville Bears
Friday night.

00:37.697 --> 00:40.765
The Bears are going down.

00:40.767 --> 00:42.933
I hate them based on
their geographical location.

00:42.935 --> 00:44.068
Good man.

00:44.070 --> 00:45.703
In addition to sports cheering,

00:45.705 --> 00:47.304
I will also decorate my locker

00:47.306 --> 00:49.138
and perhaps participate
in a school prank.

00:49.140 --> 00:52.308
One thing's for sure...
count on a lot of selfies.

00:52.310 --> 00:54.644
You can follow my antics
on social media.

00:54.646 --> 00:56.079
I've got this year down...

00:56.081 --> 00:58.915
like the Bears, who are going down.

00:59.918 --> 01:02.952
Aww, look at Brick.

01:02.954 --> 01:04.319
All full of high-school spirit.

01:05.221 --> 01:06.555
Huh. What do you think of that?

01:06.557 --> 01:09.057
I think he's going down.

01:14.399 --> 01:15.564
Oh, my God.

01:15.566 --> 01:17.833
I have read the same sentence
three times.

01:17.835 --> 01:19.668
This room is driving me crazy.

01:19.670 --> 01:21.803
Seriously, Lexie, I can't concentrate

01:21.805 --> 01:23.805
with the noise
of that stupid trash chute.

01:23.807 --> 01:26.340
Not to mention the smell
when somebody throws up in it.

01:26.342 --> 01:28.877
Come on, this is college, Sue.

01:28.879 --> 01:31.145
We're roughing it, doing it on our own.

01:31.147 --> 01:32.514
That's why, when my dad
offered to put us

01:32.516 --> 01:34.783
in a super-fancy apartment
at Gumford Falls,

01:34.785 --> 01:36.117
I said, "No, Daddy,

01:36.119 --> 01:38.386
it's time for this
Daddy's little girl to grow up."

01:38.388 --> 01:40.320
Is it, though?

01:40.322 --> 01:41.955
Whoa!

01:41.957 --> 01:43.990
What a pit.

01:43.992 --> 01:46.126
My place doesn't have a roof,
and it looks better than this.

01:46.128 --> 01:47.394
Then why don't you go there?

01:47.396 --> 01:48.295
What do you want, Axl?

01:48.297 --> 01:49.897
My tummy is rumblin'.

01:49.899 --> 01:52.499
I'm in between classes, so where is it?

01:52.501 --> 01:53.867
I know you guys must have
some girl chocolate

01:53.869 --> 01:54.935
around here somewhere.

01:54.937 --> 01:56.569
Hm? No?

01:56.571 --> 01:57.770
Hm.

01:57.772 --> 02:00.339
Okay, Lexie, I can feel
your eyes follow me around.

02:00.341 --> 02:02.575
I'm sorry, but I am taken.

02:02.577 --> 02:05.044
I'll try to restrain myself.

02:05.046 --> 02:06.378
Well, it's not gonna be easy,

02:06.380 --> 02:07.680
'cause I'm gonna bend over

02:07.682 --> 02:09.449
and look in this drawer down here.

02:09.451 --> 02:11.551
What do we got? Oh-ho!

02:11.553 --> 02:12.984
Go-diva.

02:12.986 --> 02:15.053
Mmm, mmm, mmm, these look good.

02:15.055 --> 02:16.254
It's Godiva.

02:16.256 --> 02:17.789
I said I'm taken.

02:17.791 --> 02:18.957
Oh, Sue, by the way,

02:18.959 --> 02:21.125
your weirdo boyfriend
is chained to a tree outside

02:21.127 --> 02:22.994
screaming about owls or something.

02:22.996 --> 02:24.162
Ugh, Jeremy.

02:24.164 --> 02:25.964
What?

02:25.966 --> 02:28.567
Do I sense trouble in dork-adise, huh?

02:28.569 --> 02:30.367
She's over him.

02:30.369 --> 02:31.435
Really?

02:31.437 --> 02:33.103
Why don't your break up
with him, dummy? Hm?

02:33.105 --> 02:34.738
Blagh. Almonds.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.206
Ugh.

02:37.510 --> 02:39.109
Well, I've tried breaking up with him.

02:39.111 --> 02:40.611
It's not that easy.

02:40.613 --> 02:42.446
I mean, when he puts his mind
to something,

02:42.448 --> 02:44.715
he just does not give up.

02:44.717 --> 02:46.516
And you know how weak I am.

02:46.518 --> 02:47.784
Remember how hard it was for me

02:47.786 --> 02:49.085
to finally be honest with Darrin?

02:49.087 --> 02:50.720
Sue, look...

02:50.722 --> 02:53.189
it's very simple, okay?

02:53.191 --> 02:54.557
When I want to break up with someone...

02:54.559 --> 02:55.625
not like my current relationship,

02:55.627 --> 02:56.759
in which I am very happy,

02:56.761 --> 02:59.128
Lexie, seriously, you're
embarrassing yourself...

02:59.130 --> 03:01.631
I let them break up with me.

03:01.633 --> 03:02.899
What do you mean?

03:02.901 --> 03:04.500
What I mean is
guys don't like to break up,

03:04.502 --> 03:06.267
so when they want to end a relationship,

03:06.269 --> 03:07.503
they just act like a jerk

03:07.505 --> 03:09.305
until eventually the girls
break up with them.

03:10.207 --> 03:11.306
That seems kind of mean.

03:11.308 --> 03:12.541
No, it's not mean,

03:12.543 --> 03:13.876
'cause we're letting them
do the breaking up,

03:13.878 --> 03:15.310
so it's actually quite kind.

03:15.312 --> 03:16.244
Mm.

03:16.246 --> 03:17.379
Ahh.

03:17.381 --> 03:19.080
I got to bounce.
Thank you for the chocolate.

03:19.082 --> 03:21.382
She is really making me
feel uncomfortable.

03:21.384 --> 03:22.683
Wha...

03:25.488 --> 03:27.755
I hope you told your mom
not to wait for you for dinner.

03:27.757 --> 03:29.757
Font Club may run a little late tonight.

03:29.759 --> 03:31.392
We're having a raising Helvetica party.

03:31.394 --> 03:32.894
I thought we were gonna
discuss Garamond.

03:32.896 --> 03:34.662
I'm saving that for Monday.

03:34.664 --> 03:35.897
Gara-Monday?

03:35.899 --> 03:36.964
Ah, cool.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.464
Hey, you.

03:38.466 --> 03:40.400
You ever thought about
trying out for football?

03:40.402 --> 03:41.668
Who, me?

03:41.670 --> 03:43.236
No, the wall of man behind you.

03:43.238 --> 03:45.405
I didn't see you at tryouts.
What's your name?

03:45.407 --> 03:46.573
Brick Heck.

03:46.575 --> 03:48.174
Again, not you.

03:48.176 --> 03:49.976
Why don't you come to practice,
see if you like it.

03:49.978 --> 03:52.311
We could always use help
with nose tackle.

03:52.313 --> 03:53.312
What's your name?

03:53.314 --> 03:54.813
Troy Tangaroa.

03:54.815 --> 03:56.815
Tango.

03:56.817 --> 03:58.083
Tango.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.293
So, Sue took Axl's advice

04:08.295 --> 04:10.663
and implemented Operation Jerk.

04:10.665 --> 04:12.664
Hey, where you been?

04:12.666 --> 04:14.032
I've been texting you all morning.

04:14.034 --> 04:15.299
Did you forget to set the alarm

04:15.301 --> 04:16.767
to get up and save our dying planet?

04:16.769 --> 04:17.902
Nah, I got your texts.

04:17.904 --> 04:19.704
Just got, uh, other things to do.

04:19.706 --> 04:22.339
You know, been busy, doesn't matter.

04:22.341 --> 04:23.675
Whatevs.

04:23.677 --> 04:25.176
Okay.

04:25.178 --> 04:27.144
Well, at least you're here now.

04:27.146 --> 04:29.179
Why don't you hand out these pamphlets.

04:29.181 --> 04:30.313
I...

04:30.315 --> 04:32.716
The sea ice in the Arctic Circle
is melting!

04:32.718 --> 04:35.586
Sign our petition to protect
the polar bears!

04:37.489 --> 04:40.223
I don't know. Polar bears
are kind of overrated.

04:40.225 --> 04:42.025
Do they really need our help?

04:42.027 --> 04:45.361
I went to a zoo once,
and they seemed fine.

04:45.363 --> 04:46.963
The polar bears are dying

04:46.965 --> 04:49.565
because of man's endless thirst for oil.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.266
Yeah, but if you're on a long road trip

04:51.268 --> 04:53.102
and you need a place
to go inside and pee,

04:53.104 --> 04:55.738
where are you gonna go
if you don't have a gas station?

04:55.740 --> 04:57.506
So thank you, oil.

05:00.177 --> 05:02.811
Big corporations
are pillaging Mother Earth.

05:02.813 --> 05:04.779
But don't big corporations

05:04.781 --> 05:08.083
always have our best interests at heart?

05:08.085 --> 05:09.584
No, they don't.

05:09.586 --> 05:12.487
They support child labor.

05:12.489 --> 05:15.389
Keeps the kids off their phones,
am I right?

05:15.391 --> 05:17.425
Sue, what's going on?

05:17.427 --> 05:19.893
Guess I'm just a big, giant jerk.

05:19.895 --> 05:21.128
No, no, no, no, no.

05:21.130 --> 05:23.430
You're just still working out
some meat toxins

05:23.432 --> 05:24.431
from your system.

05:24.433 --> 05:26.166
Yeah, that's right.

05:26.168 --> 05:28.102
I saw you eating bacon
at breakfast yesterday.

05:29.338 --> 05:30.170
O-okay, okay.

05:30.172 --> 05:31.672
Jeremy... Okay.

05:31.674 --> 05:34.675
Don't you feel like lately,
I don't know,

05:34.677 --> 05:37.777
we're just... in different places?

05:37.779 --> 05:39.746
Hey, hey, we're not in different places.

05:39.748 --> 05:44.017
We're right here
on a journey... together.

05:44.019 --> 05:45.184
Okay.

05:45.186 --> 05:48.487
But don't you feel like, I don't know,

05:48.489 --> 05:51.891
lately, it's gotten kind of hard?

05:51.893 --> 05:54.092
Changing the world is hard, Sue.

05:54.094 --> 05:56.594
We're not quitting on the earth
when she needs us the most,

05:56.596 --> 05:58.563
and I'm not quitting on us.

05:58.565 --> 06:00.231
You're not quitting on me, are you, Sue?

06:02.136 --> 06:04.402
No.

06:04.404 --> 06:05.704
Okay, then.

06:08.108 --> 06:10.741
Hey, you! Hey, fashion slave!

06:12.611 --> 06:15.279
Hey, what's that on your butt?

06:15.281 --> 06:16.881
Huh?

06:16.883 --> 06:18.448
There's some kind of message there.

06:18.450 --> 06:19.283
What?

06:19.285 --> 06:20.785
What are you talking about?

06:20.787 --> 06:22.252
I can't see anything. Huh.

06:22.254 --> 06:24.221
Wait. Oh, my God.

06:24.223 --> 06:26.290
I did not mean to get these.

06:26.292 --> 06:27.424
If you say so.

06:27.426 --> 06:31.227
Seriously, do these look
like something I'd buy?

06:31.229 --> 06:32.896
I don't know.

06:32.898 --> 06:35.331
You buy T-shirts for those
fun runs you never go on.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.266
No, no, they were all on this table...

06:37.268 --> 06:39.669
5 for 20 bucks...
so I just grabbed a handful.

06:39.671 --> 06:40.804
I bought all these normal ones.

06:40.806 --> 06:42.371
This must have got in by mistake.

06:42.373 --> 06:44.040
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

06:44.042 --> 06:45.473
I'm gonna have to return them.

06:45.475 --> 06:46.775
Why?

06:46.777 --> 06:49.945
Right, I'm gonna wear something
that says "I'd hit that."

06:49.947 --> 06:51.346
Come on, that's ridiculous.

06:51.348 --> 06:52.447
Boy, lesson learned...

06:52.449 --> 06:54.950
Never shop for underwear
without your glasses.

06:54.952 --> 06:58.253
Well, I guess if you need reading
glasses to see the underwear,

06:58.255 --> 07:00.022
you should probably just go
straight to diapers.

07:05.628 --> 07:07.595
What happened to all the Hen stuff?

07:07.597 --> 07:09.864
Uh, I wasn't in the mood.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.337
What's the matter?

07:11.339 --> 07:13.072
High school not treating you so good?

07:13.074 --> 07:15.808
No, but it sure is treating Troy good.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.110
I don't get it.

07:17.112 --> 07:18.911
One second, I'm walking down
the hall with my best friend,

07:18.913 --> 07:19.978
and the next second,

07:19.980 --> 07:21.646
he's swallowed up by the football team.

07:21.648 --> 07:23.615
Troy's on the football team?

07:23.617 --> 07:26.084
Really? That's your takeaway
from this conversation?

07:26.086 --> 07:27.219
Well, I'm just saying... football...

07:27.221 --> 07:28.286
a lot of people think that's a big deal.

07:28.288 --> 07:29.321
Aren't you happy for him?

07:29.323 --> 07:31.523
No, not at all. Not even a little.

07:31.525 --> 07:33.425
That sounds a little selfish,
don't you think?

07:33.427 --> 07:35.660
It's not just about him being popular.

07:35.662 --> 07:38.095
I mean, he didn't even show up
for Font Club.

07:38.097 --> 07:40.231
That could be for a lot of reasons.

07:40.233 --> 07:42.666
Maybe you just got to put in
a little more effort, Brick,

07:42.668 --> 07:44.001
that's all.

07:44.003 --> 07:46.003
And, hey, find out what position
they got him playing,

07:46.005 --> 07:47.471
'cause they really need a nose tackle.

07:47.473 --> 07:49.973
Although, they could put him
somewhere on the O-line.

07:51.644 --> 07:52.809
Fine.

07:52.811 --> 07:55.345
Write down the sports words,
and I'll try and ask.

07:55.347 --> 07:57.147
Okay.

07:59.157 --> 08:02.097
Tell the university to divest
its endowment...

08:02.137 --> 08:03.269
Breaking up with Jeremy

08:03.271 --> 08:04.604
was harder than Sue thought,

08:04.606 --> 08:06.740
so she took the obvious next step...

08:06.742 --> 08:09.575
got her no-cut a cappella group
to do it for her.

08:10.745 --> 08:12.678
This is from Sue.

08:14.082 --> 08:14.947
Three, four.

08:18.519 --> 08:19.618
Whoo, whoo!

08:26.392 --> 08:28.559
Great plays, you guys. Great plays.

08:28.561 --> 08:30.929
Franklin went down.

08:30.931 --> 08:31.930
And remember,

08:31.932 --> 08:34.032
when football is over, Font Club.

08:34.034 --> 08:35.866
Wednesdays after school
in the Xerox room.

08:35.869 --> 08:37.368
Limited cookies for early comers.

08:37.370 --> 08:38.302
Troy.

08:38.304 --> 08:39.169
Hey, Brick.

08:39.172 --> 08:40.905
- You see me play?
- I did.

08:40.907 --> 08:42.373
The way that you pushed down that person

08:42.375 --> 08:43.640
was quite impressive.

08:43.642 --> 08:44.708
Thanks, man.

08:44.710 --> 08:45.976
Anyways, I was wondering
if you were free

08:45.978 --> 08:47.477
to grab some French fries on Saturday.

08:47.479 --> 08:49.146
Oh, shoot.

08:49.148 --> 08:51.715
One of the guys, Psycho,
is having a party Saturday.

08:51.717 --> 08:54.084
Oh. Okay.

08:54.086 --> 08:55.119
Wait.

08:55.121 --> 08:57.054
You should come.

08:57.056 --> 08:58.088
Oh.

08:58.090 --> 08:59.822
Sure, I guess.

08:59.824 --> 09:01.791
Should I have my parents
call Psycho's parents?

09:01.793 --> 09:03.292
I don't think
high school works that way.

09:03.294 --> 09:05.161
Great.

09:07.732 --> 09:08.898
Go Hens.

09:08.900 --> 09:09.899
Go Hens!

09:13.905 --> 09:15.704
Mm-mwah.

09:15.706 --> 09:17.172
I knew Grandma sent you fudge.

09:17.174 --> 09:18.373
Didn't she send you any?

09:18.375 --> 09:19.775
Yeah, but it's gone.

09:19.777 --> 09:20.742
I knew I could count on

09:20.744 --> 09:22.110
your "I'll only eat one a day

09:22.112 --> 09:23.979
to make the pleasure last" theory.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.114
Okay, well, you do not
deserve fudge, Axl.

09:26.116 --> 09:27.348
Your advice didn't work.

09:27.350 --> 09:29.384
What? Did you act like a jerk?

09:29.386 --> 09:30.451
Yes!

09:30.453 --> 09:31.753
You would have been so proud of me.

09:31.755 --> 09:34.521
I was totally obnoxious,
but he didn't care.

09:34.523 --> 09:35.622
Amateur.

09:35.624 --> 09:36.991
You want me to break up
with him for you?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.192
You would do that for me?

09:38.194 --> 09:39.293
Of course, Sue.

09:39.295 --> 09:41.595
You're my sister.
I'd do anything for you.

09:41.597 --> 09:43.330
And 20 bucks.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.099
You would charge your own family?

09:45.101 --> 09:46.633
Hey, the Boss Co. Break Up Service rate

09:46.635 --> 09:47.634
is normally $25.

09:47.636 --> 09:49.203
I'm giving you a family discount.

09:49.205 --> 09:51.737
What about all the chocolate
you've been eating?

09:51.739 --> 09:52.806
You're right.

09:52.808 --> 09:54.808
I should probably buy my own chocolate.

09:54.810 --> 09:55.809
Better make it $25.

09:59.815 --> 10:00.713
Excuse me.

10:00.715 --> 10:02.648
I would like to return an item.

10:02.650 --> 10:05.318
It's kind of... embarrassing.

10:05.320 --> 10:09.188
Obviously, I didn't mean to buy these.

10:09.190 --> 10:10.289
Obviously.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.690
Well, not that obviously.

10:11.692 --> 10:13.391
I mean, I could wear those.

10:13.393 --> 10:14.993
Oh, sure, of course.

10:14.995 --> 10:16.128
Back in the day, right?

10:16.130 --> 10:17.996
Anyway, let me just get a price check.

10:17.998 --> 10:19.698
Uh, Tiffany, can I get a price check

10:19.700 --> 10:20.999
on I'd Hit That?

10:21.001 --> 10:22.701
Well, no, no, no, no.

10:22.703 --> 10:24.036
Not just back in the day.

10:24.038 --> 10:26.637
I mean, it's still within
the realm of possibility.

10:26.639 --> 10:29.373
There are people that
have wanted to hit that before.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.574
Even recently.

10:30.576 --> 10:32.643
I mean, I have a loving husband.

10:32.645 --> 10:34.511
We have a good relationship.

10:34.513 --> 10:36.347
Sure, we get busy and tired,

10:36.349 --> 10:37.715
and we still have one kid at home.

10:37.717 --> 10:40.351
And I have stomach issues.
They want me off the Dr. Pepper.

10:40.353 --> 10:41.518
I'm down to one.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.253
Otherwise, that would get hit
a lot more.

10:43.797 --> 10:45.388
Well, we usually don't accept returns,

10:45.390 --> 10:47.891
but I'll make an exception
because your story's so sad.

10:47.893 --> 10:49.993
So, do you want this
on your credit card or cash?

10:49.995 --> 10:51.561
I-I-I'm sorry, I just feel like

10:51.563 --> 10:53.964
I really need to make a point here.

10:53.966 --> 10:55.966
I think, for a woman my age,

10:55.968 --> 10:57.934
I have kept myself in pretty good shape.

10:57.936 --> 11:00.169
I have been an inactive member
of a ladies gym

11:00.171 --> 11:01.837
going on 22 years now.

11:01.839 --> 11:03.005
And yeah, sure,

11:03.007 --> 11:04.940
I hit the frosting every now and then,

11:04.942 --> 11:07.276
but I have been blessed
with a fast metabolism.

11:07.278 --> 11:09.044
Look, if you want
something more your style

11:09.046 --> 11:11.247
and more, you know, functional,

11:11.249 --> 11:12.781
you might try the Undergarment Garage.

11:12.783 --> 11:13.916
My mom loves it.

11:13.918 --> 11:17.585
Hey, I am not
Undergarment Garage material.

11:17.587 --> 11:19.387
I am still vibrant.

11:19.389 --> 11:21.655
As a matter of fact,
I will keep these underwear,

11:21.657 --> 11:23.925
and I will also take...

11:23.927 --> 11:27.128
Hashtag Hottie...

11:27.130 --> 11:28.496
Twerk it...

11:28.498 --> 11:30.431
uh, Party In My Pants...

11:30.433 --> 11:33.833
and, uh, oh, no, no...
this is disgusting.

11:33.835 --> 11:35.002
You should keep these in the back.

11:35.004 --> 11:36.736
Kids are walking by.

11:40.084 --> 11:43.476
Free refreshments! Hey! Care for
a big glass of fracking juice?

11:43.543 --> 11:44.942
Make yourself a frackarita.

11:44.944 --> 11:45.943
You like that?

11:45.945 --> 11:47.511
Yo, dude.

11:47.513 --> 11:48.646
We need to talk.

11:48.648 --> 11:50.982
Listen, my sister's done with you.

11:50.984 --> 11:54.418
Is she? Axl, let me ask you something.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.687
Have you ever been in love?

12:00.159 --> 12:00.991
Yo.

12:00.993 --> 12:02.492
Ah!

12:02.494 --> 12:04.661
Oh, hey.

12:04.663 --> 12:07.397
So, is it done?

12:07.399 --> 12:10.533
Uh... yeah-ish.

12:10.535 --> 12:11.902
Oh, my God. You didn't do it.

12:11.904 --> 12:13.103
Uh...

12:13.105 --> 12:14.504
He talked about love, okay?!

12:14.506 --> 12:16.372
And I'm very sensitive
to that right now.

12:16.374 --> 12:17.740
So when the four of us
go to dinner on Thursday,

12:17.742 --> 12:18.741
we can talk about it then.

12:18.743 --> 12:21.210
I cannot believe you caved, Axl.

12:21.212 --> 12:22.778
I want my money back.

12:22.780 --> 12:23.913
I don't have it.

12:23.915 --> 12:25.614
I gave it to stop fracking.
The guy is good.

12:25.616 --> 12:26.448
Hey.

12:26.450 --> 12:28.450
Oh, Lexie, seriously?

12:28.452 --> 12:31.620
You're a very cute girl.
Just please, have some dignity.

12:31.622 --> 12:32.454
No.

12:32.456 --> 12:34.555
Hey.

12:34.557 --> 12:37.358
Just so you know,
we bought you some lunch meat,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.027
so you can tell the school
they can stop calling.

12:39.029 --> 12:40.095
I talked to Troy.

12:40.097 --> 12:41.096
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

12:41.098 --> 12:42.463
He invited me to a party.

12:42.465 --> 12:43.865
Hey, great.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.200
Did you find out
what position he's playing?

12:45.202 --> 12:48.536
Actual son here trying
to work through a problem.

12:48.538 --> 12:50.871
Anyway, at first,
I was looking forward to going,

12:50.873 --> 12:52.773
but now I'm worried.

12:52.775 --> 12:55.109
What am I gonna say to a bunch of jocks?

12:55.111 --> 12:56.910
Can you give me
some football terms to use

12:56.912 --> 12:58.178
so I don't embarrass myself

12:58.180 --> 13:00.114
trying to fit into
the conversational bouquet?

13:00.116 --> 13:03.416
Uh, first of all,
I'd steer clear of "bouquet."

13:03.418 --> 13:05.518
Second, just talk about anything.

13:05.520 --> 13:06.486
Just be yourself.

13:06.488 --> 13:08.420
Should I talk about Charlie Rose?

13:08.422 --> 13:10.289
No. Why would you do that?

13:10.291 --> 13:11.724
Well, I like his interviewing style.

13:11.726 --> 13:14.393
The way he takes one topic
and really delves into it.

13:14.395 --> 13:15.427
Um, just talk,

13:15.429 --> 13:18.497
like, uh, "Hey, what class are you in?

13:18.499 --> 13:20.099
Where'd you get those sneakers?"

13:20.101 --> 13:21.768
You're giving me tall-guy advice.

13:21.770 --> 13:23.269
That all works coming from you.

13:23.271 --> 13:24.836
If I did it, I'm just the weirdo

13:24.838 --> 13:26.772
paying too much attention
to people's shoes.

13:26.774 --> 13:28.073
Okay, whatever.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.674
I'm just saying don't put
so much pressure on it.

13:29.676 --> 13:30.608
Relax.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.877
You know a joke? Tell a joke.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.612
I don't know any jokes.

13:34.614 --> 13:35.713
Oh.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.649
Well, um...

13:37.651 --> 13:40.152
Okay, here's one I like.

13:40.154 --> 13:41.386
Your mom is so ugly,

13:41.388 --> 13:43.353
when she goes to the zoo,
she needs two tickets...

13:43.355 --> 13:46.323
one to get in and one to get out.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.992
I don't understand.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.927
Well, they're saying that she's so ugly

13:49.929 --> 13:51.796
they think she's an animal.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.099
So she needs a ticket
to get out of the zoo.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.168
So, you're saying
if an animal had a ticket,

13:57.170 --> 13:58.669
the zoo would just let it out?

13:58.671 --> 13:59.903
That's not safe.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.938
And how would he even carry
a ticket with its hooves?

14:01.940 --> 14:02.872
No, it...

14:02.874 --> 14:04.107
You're missing the point.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.109
Is the animal being let
out of the zoo the joke part?

14:06.111 --> 14:09.245
No! The woman is so ugly
they think she's an animal.

14:09.247 --> 14:10.313
That's the joke.

14:10.315 --> 14:11.647
- Is it?
- Yes!

14:11.649 --> 14:13.382
So I'm insulting someone's mother,

14:13.384 --> 14:15.751
animals are on the loose
causing chaos in society,

14:15.753 --> 14:18.120
and the zoo is somehow
charging people to leave.

14:18.122 --> 14:19.955
I'm sorry, there's just
so much wrong with this, Dad.

14:19.957 --> 14:21.223
Thank you,

14:21.225 --> 14:23.058
but when it comes to talking
to teenage football players,

14:23.060 --> 14:24.893
I'll take my chances with Charlie Rose.

14:32.836 --> 14:34.535
Boop.

14:34.537 --> 14:36.403
You didn't return them, did you?

14:36.405 --> 14:37.604
No, I did not.

14:37.606 --> 14:40.975
In fact, I bought more,
and I'm happy I did.

14:40.977 --> 14:44.846
I am telling you, Mike,
these things are power.

14:44.848 --> 14:46.080
Mm-hmm. You know what?

14:46.082 --> 14:47.548
I'm gonna finally quit the gym.

14:47.550 --> 14:49.883
They keep sucking me in
with their free magnets

14:49.885 --> 14:53.086
and their little measuring cups
for doling out cereal.

14:53.088 --> 14:56.089
Well, I'll have as much cereal
as I want, Mindy,

14:56.091 --> 14:58.825
'cause I'm a metabolizing machine.

14:58.827 --> 14:59.860
You go, girl.

14:59.862 --> 15:01.161
Oh, I didn't get that pair,

15:01.163 --> 15:03.096
but I got some good ones.

15:03.098 --> 15:05.131
So, I'm not gonna tell you
what they are,

15:05.133 --> 15:08.067
so make sure you wear your
reading glasses to bed tonight.

15:15.243 --> 15:17.943
Got a pizza for Sue Hack.

15:19.247 --> 15:20.545
That's me.

15:23.251 --> 15:24.782
Wait a minute.

15:24.784 --> 15:28.286
No, I-I ordered a large
pepperoni with extra cheese.

15:28.288 --> 15:30.221
This is a small with green peppers.

15:30.223 --> 15:34.292
That's the pizza they gave me,
so... take it or leave it.

15:34.294 --> 15:35.626
Fine.

15:37.397 --> 15:38.796
Are you kidding me?!

15:38.798 --> 15:41.899
The room just ate the pizza
I didn't even want.

15:41.901 --> 15:44.501
Oh, yeah. It's November 1st.

15:44.503 --> 15:46.203
That's when they
reverse the air for heat,

15:46.205 --> 15:48.238
so instead of blowing, it sucks.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.373
Yes.

15:49.375 --> 15:50.473
Yes, it does.

15:50.475 --> 15:53.243
I hate this room and I hate Jeremy.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.311
What happened to me?

15:54.313 --> 15:55.812
I used to stand up for myself.

15:55.814 --> 15:57.014
I used to have grit.

15:57.016 --> 15:58.881
I fought for everything
I've ever gotten.

15:58.883 --> 15:59.715
Gah!

15:59.717 --> 16:01.017
And now I'm just a doormat?

16:01.019 --> 16:02.885
No, no, not anymore!

16:02.887 --> 16:05.621
You, get me the right pizza.

16:05.623 --> 16:08.925
You, starting packing,
'cause we're leaving this dump.

16:08.927 --> 16:12.094
And me, I've got a boyfriend
to break up with.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.263
- Jeremy.
- Oh, hey.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.497
Sue, glad you're here. I'm chaining
myself to the administration building.

16:16.499 --> 16:17.665
I need you to hold my pee bottle.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.767
Uh... what? No.

16:19.769 --> 16:21.269
You hold your own pee bottle.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.571
I have something to say,
and I need you to listen.

16:23.573 --> 16:25.907
Sue, you can wait. The earth can't.

16:25.909 --> 16:27.675
Stop it. Jeremy, no.

16:27.677 --> 16:31.446
For once, you are going
to stay and listen to me.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.947
Sue, what are you do...

16:37.119 --> 16:38.919
Jeremy...

16:38.921 --> 16:41.155
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

16:41.157 --> 16:43.590
Wow, this came out of nowhere.

16:43.592 --> 16:45.025
Are you serious?

16:45.027 --> 16:46.193
I sent my brother.

16:46.195 --> 16:47.995
I sent my nocut a cappella group

16:47.997 --> 16:50.663
to sing "We Are Never Ever
Getting Back Together."

16:50.665 --> 16:52.265
They sang "Chattanooga Choo Choo."

16:52.267 --> 16:54.533
Ugh, Landis. Mnh.

16:54.535 --> 16:55.668
Always pushing his own agenda.

16:55.670 --> 16:56.769
He's got a solo in that one.

16:56.771 --> 16:58.104
He shouldn't.

16:58.106 --> 16:59.405
Look...

16:59.407 --> 17:01.540
Look, Sue, we can't break up.
We're a team.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.776
Me, the fierce, tireless,
natural-born leader,

17:03.778 --> 17:05.911
and you... the naturalborn follower.

17:07.047 --> 17:08.246
What?

17:08.248 --> 17:10.315
You think I'm a follower?

17:10.317 --> 17:13.151
Sue, babe, I didn't mean
follower as a bad thing.

17:13.153 --> 17:15.920
I just meant that I have
all this great knowledge.

17:15.922 --> 17:17.589
I'm the person out there
on the front lines

17:17.590 --> 17:19.057
changing the world,

17:19.059 --> 17:21.859
and you're like this sponge
that soaks up everything I say.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.827
I am not a sponge.

17:24.829 --> 17:26.329
I have grit.

17:26.332 --> 17:28.565
Sponges do not have grit.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.001
Okay, some sponges have grit,

17:30.003 --> 17:31.835
like the ones with the pot-scoury side,

17:31.837 --> 17:33.004
but that's not the point.

17:33.006 --> 17:35.939
The point is you think
I am your mindless follower?

17:36.976 --> 17:39.243
You want to know what I think, Jeremy?

17:39.245 --> 17:41.844
I think you don't do all
this stuff for the earth.

17:41.846 --> 17:44.147
I think you do it for you

17:44.149 --> 17:47.217
because you don't actually care
about anyone else's ideas.

17:47.219 --> 17:49.185
You only care about your own ideas

17:49.187 --> 17:50.920
and hearing yourself talk.

17:50.922 --> 17:52.388
So, pardon me, Jeremy.

17:52.390 --> 17:53.523
Is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?

17:53.525 --> 17:56.692
Yeah, it is, and it's going thata-way.

17:56.694 --> 17:59.719
And you are going that-a-way.

18:00.431 --> 18:02.231
Wait, uh, Sue, the... the...

18:08.712 --> 18:10.045
Hey, buddy, how'd it go?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.547
Ugh.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.048
That bad, huh?

18:13.050 --> 18:14.483
Actually, I was amazing.

18:14.485 --> 18:15.717
Your zoo joke killed.

18:15.719 --> 18:16.751
Huh.

18:16.753 --> 18:17.952
And when I asked the guys

18:17.954 --> 18:19.220
to explain why it was funny,

18:19.222 --> 18:20.288
I got an even bigger laugh.

18:21.324 --> 18:22.856
And then it just got worse from there.

18:22.858 --> 18:23.691
I don't get it.

18:23.693 --> 18:24.758
You talked to people.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.727
You came back wearing both your shoes.

18:26.729 --> 18:27.895
From where I'm sitting,

18:27.897 --> 18:30.030
it sounds like you had
a pretty good night.

18:30.032 --> 18:32.066
Truly, it couldn't have gone better.

18:32.068 --> 18:34.435
I was witty, interesting.

18:34.437 --> 18:36.469
I used a curse word to great effect.

18:36.471 --> 18:39.439
But it was just... exhausting.

18:39.441 --> 18:40.440
All I could think about

18:40.442 --> 18:42.008
was how long before I could leave.

18:42.010 --> 18:45.378
Uh, well, that explains the 8:30 pickup.

18:45.380 --> 18:46.613
I don't know.

18:46.615 --> 18:49.216
I guess I wanted the whole
high-school experience,

18:49.218 --> 18:51.518
but it ended up feeling
like a lot of work.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.586
Yeah, I don't know what
to tell you, Brick.

18:53.588 --> 18:54.653
That's high school.

18:54.655 --> 18:57.356
You feel all this pressure to be social,

18:57.358 --> 18:59.868
go to parties,
hang out with the right people.

19:00.695 --> 19:02.194
It gets a little easier in your 20s.

19:02.196 --> 19:04.830
You can go out or stay home.

19:04.832 --> 19:08.334
Then when you're 50, well,
you can just stay home.

19:08.336 --> 19:10.034
Oh, thank God.

19:10.036 --> 19:11.669
I wish I was 50.

19:11.671 --> 19:13.438
Eh, there's trade-offs.

19:13.440 --> 19:14.739
Look, the main thing is

19:14.741 --> 19:16.341
you stepped up to the plate
and you took a swing,

19:16.343 --> 19:17.842
and I'm proud of you.

19:19.512 --> 19:20.612
So, what's the plan for tomorrow?

19:20.614 --> 19:22.179
You want to stop at the hardware store

19:22.181 --> 19:23.948
after church, maybe grab a...

19:23.950 --> 19:27.851
Dad, would you mind if we're
just quiet for a little while?

19:27.853 --> 19:29.927
I would not mind that at all.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.858
Well, I didn't quit the gym.

19:34.860 --> 19:36.860
When I got there,
the underwear kicked in,

19:36.862 --> 19:38.362
and I wanted to work out.

19:38.364 --> 19:40.230
Plus, Mindy made some excellent points.

19:40.232 --> 19:42.299
And they have these new
collapsible bowls now

19:42.301 --> 19:43.599
that you can pop in your purse

19:43.601 --> 19:45.601
and just take right to a restaurant.

19:45.603 --> 19:47.637
Makes portion control so much easier.

19:54.779 --> 19:57.079
Ma'am, can you hear me?

19:57.081 --> 19:58.514
Excuse me, ma'am, can you hear me?

20:00.337 --> 20:02.636
You took quite a spill there.

20:02.665 --> 20:04.632
Just gonna check your hips
for any bruising or fractures.

20:04.921 --> 20:05.987
Okay.

20:07.157 --> 20:09.056
No, wait.

20:09.058 --> 20:10.925
No, see, there was this table,

20:10.927 --> 20:12.994
and they had all the underwear
spread out on them,

20:12.996 --> 20:14.862
and I wasn't wearing my glasses.

20:14.864 --> 20:17.564
You know, it's funny
where you draw your power from.

20:17.566 --> 20:19.333
It could be from your underpants.

20:21.203 --> 20:23.136
It could be from a pizza-stealing vent.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.941
And sometimes, it can come
from a really good friend.

20:27.943 --> 20:29.410
- Then I said...
- You know what?

20:29.412 --> 20:31.478
Why don't we just dispense with
the reading of the minutes.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.713
All in favor...

20:34.249 --> 20:36.215
Sorry I'm late.

20:36.217 --> 20:38.351
Troy. What are you doing here?

20:38.476 --> 20:40.275
We're discussing Helvetica Bold, right?

20:40.300 --> 20:41.667
Wouldn't want to miss that.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.957
In fact, I told the whole
football team about it.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.225
Really?

20:49.597 --> 20:51.596
Well, we should probably get started.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.164
Um, okay.

20:53.166 --> 20:55.434
Cindy, did you make your list
of top-five fonts?

20:55.436 --> 20:56.267
Yes.

20:56.269 --> 20:57.869
- Nexa Bold.
- Mmhmm.

20:57.871 --> 20:59.371
- Manifesto.
- Mm.

20:59.373 --> 21:00.972
I know, Brick, I know.

21:00.974 --> 21:02.173
You're not a fan of upper case.

21:02.175 --> 21:03.942
But I happen to like that it's inspired

21:03.944 --> 21:06.812
by the Italian rationalist
movement of the 1920s.

21:06.814 --> 21:09.580
No, it's fine if you want a font
to slap you in the face.

21:09.582 --> 21:12.750
But in my opinion,
there's Bookman Old Style.

21:12.752 --> 21:14.452
That's such an artistic font.

21:14.454 --> 21:17.020
It's in so many pieces
of literature nowadays.

21:17.022 --> 21:19.022
And if you want something's that's bold,

21:19.024 --> 21:20.391
there's always oblique.

21:23.399 --> 21:32.153
