14:13.320 --> 14:14.402
Are you fucking kidding me?

14:14.487 --> 14:16.738
Come on, this is not a surprise.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.406
Nobody could have turned
this limp dick paper

14:18.491 --> 14:20.041
around in a year.
What did they expect?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.410

14:22.495 --> 14:24.829

They can eat shit.

-Well...

14:43.316 --> 14:44.548
Temporarily.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.716
Thank god.

Nine whole months of not working

Just hang tight, okay?

No. I've got something.
It can't wait.

14:58.782 --> 15:01.366

kick the publisher out?

15:01.451 --> 15:02.584
I don't know.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.503

15:49.799 --> 15:52.717
Lab tech:
We usually hold these
for evidence,

15:52.802 --> 15:55.003
but I thought you'd want them.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.123
What is it?

15:59.225 --> 16:01.175
Tianna's personal items.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.736
You really should go home
and get some sleep.

16:11.821 --> 16:15.106
All of this will be waiting
on you when you get back.

16:20.780 --> 16:24.415
She's right. We should just go.

16:24.501 --> 16:27.085
Fuck that. I'm not leaving.

I know it ain't the ritz,

17:03.406 --> 17:04.822
but our tenants
moved out suddenly,

17:04.908 --> 17:08.543
so the utilities work
till the end of the month.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.879
I'll be back with some food
in a little while.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.389
Don't leave, don't call nobody.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.424
Just lay low.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.376

to drop you somewhere?
-No, I'm okay, I'm good.

-What the fuck is up, man?
-I'm sorry-- no, no, s-sorry.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.168
We have to prepare her

20:04.254 --> 20:06.671
-Hey, you ain't finna
cut up my little girl!
-Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

She was shot!

20:12.762 --> 20:15.879

20:28.695 --> 20:30.861

21:09.869 --> 21:12.770
-Okay. So what's up?
-Uh...

21:12.855 --> 21:15.106
A five-year-old girl got killed.

21:15.191 --> 21:18.192
Yesterday afternoon in gardena.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.861

what the cops know.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.730
Killed by one of your men?

21:24.117 --> 21:26.567
Can you help me out, or no?

21:29.872 --> 21:32.790
Yeah. Yeah,
just give me a few hours.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.460
Thanks.

bringing in cocaine.

I-I mean, this is huge.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.879

21:59.652 --> 22:00.851

Look, that is a lot to ask for.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.331
Really? You have a better plan
for how to save this paper?

22:13.416 --> 22:15.666
'cause I'm pretty sure
this story keeps the lights on

22:15.752 --> 22:16.951
and then some.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.786
Walter:
You don't have a story.

22:18.871 --> 22:21.789
You have one source,
off the record.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.074
Charlie:
Before we commit,

22:24.177 --> 22:26.076
get some kind of corroboration,
all right?

22:26.179 --> 22:28.245
A legitimate second source.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.848
You think the dea agent
is, what, making it up?

22:30.933 --> 22:32.016
Look, if the story's
as big as you say it is,

22:32.101 --> 22:33.100
there's got to be
some other way of

22:33.219 --> 22:35.136

we push all our chips in.

28:41.937 --> 28:44.855
Money is protection.

28:44.940 --> 28:48.275
No one is hurting
<i> mi gente</i> again.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.528
That's fine. What else?

28:52.531 --> 28:53.897
I want you to find lucia.

28:53.999 --> 28:56.450
Cia can do that, no?

28:58.037 --> 29:01.121
Look, you're talking
about cleaning up.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.590
You really think digging around
in the past

29:03.709 --> 29:05.259
is the way to do that?

29:05.878 --> 29:07.628
I can't keep wondering.

29:08.631 --> 29:10.514
Just need to know what happened.

29:10.599 --> 29:14.301
You do that, then we're good.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.891
You went to see him?

29:20.976 --> 29:23.610
He's staying in my building.

29:23.729 --> 29:25.863
Thought I should check on him.

29:25.948 --> 29:29.233
-See if he's okay.
-Why?

29:30.119 --> 29:34.571
'cause he's no different
than you, franklin.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.632

30:29.128 --> 30:32.846

-Nah.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.849

30:35.968 --> 30:38.468

-Skully.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.310

Well, this nigga here
trying to apologize.

30:53.903 --> 30:55.852

30:55.955 --> 30:58.455
And you gonna accept it for me.

30:59.575 --> 31:00.207
Fuck you.

31:01.243 --> 31:02.709
Hey, nigga, that's still

31:04.046 --> 31:05.913

motherfucking daddy.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.915

31:08.000 --> 31:11.635

31:18.594 --> 31:20.227

31:21.013 --> 31:24.598
You told me not
to have her around this shit.

31:29.855 --> 31:33.407
And now my baby girl gone.

31:34.777 --> 31:37.361
You ain't the reason she gone.

31:40.032 --> 31:42.616
Got to let that shit go.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.701
It ain't on you.

31:53.596 --> 31:55.596

31:55.714 --> 31:56.847

-Uh, no.

31:59.268 --> 32:02.636

we've been here?
-Diego: Too long.

32:02.721 --> 32:03.971
-Way too fucking long.
-No calls.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.922
-No lawyer.
-No trial.

32:06.025 --> 32:09.860
And you show up,
asking for our help?

32:09.945 --> 32:12.613
-It's not cool,<i> chica.</i>
-Far fucking from it.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.031
Hold on. Are you serious?

32:14.116 --> 32:15.866

One minute we're at lax,

32:22.741 --> 32:24.708

our grandmothers.

32:24.793 --> 32:26.910
Our sick grandmothers.

32:26.996 --> 32:28.078
When all of a sudden,
we're arrested,

32:28.163 --> 32:29.713
thrown in a cell and forgotten.

32:29.798 --> 32:31.614

32:31.717 --> 32:32.749
Isn't this america?

32:32.835 --> 32:33.967
Diego:
We could have stayed in colombia

32:34.086 --> 32:35.168
if we wanted
to be treated like this.

32:35.254 --> 32:38.588
At least there
we'd be with our nanas.

32:39.642 --> 32:40.924
Listen to me.

32:41.010 --> 32:43.960
This is exactly the kind of
corruption I'm trying to fight.

32:44.063 --> 32:47.147
If you can confirm my story,
I promise I'll do everything

32:47.266 --> 32:50.317
-I can to see you
get a fair trial.
-Diego: Mm.

32:51.904 --> 32:55.739

32:55.824 --> 32:57.941

32:58.027 --> 33:02.245
It's not snitching if you're
getting the guy who gave you up.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.000
Say that again.

33:07.119 --> 33:09.953
According to my dea source,
reed thompson used you

33:10.039 --> 33:13.874
as bargaining chips to get one
of his assets out of trouble.

33:13.959 --> 33:16.460
He's the reason you're in here.

33:17.963 --> 33:22.015
Help me, not only
will I get you a trial,

33:22.134 --> 33:25.385
I'll take down the man
who put you here.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.692

33:31.810 --> 33:34.844

33:34.947 --> 33:37.481
off of a bullet
they found at the scene.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.617
So they know he was there.

33:42.121 --> 33:46.356
And I'll help out in any way
I can on my end, but...

33:46.458 --> 33:49.993
Understand that you're all
listed as-as known associates.

33:50.079 --> 33:52.028
Which means that the longer
it takes to find him,

33:52.131 --> 33:55.882
the more heat you're gonna feel
coming down on you here.

33:56.001 --> 33:58.368

41:42.884 --> 41:45.218
everything go back
to the way it was.

41:45.804 --> 41:47.754
Nah. Nah, can't do that.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.540
You really want to go to war?

41:50.642 --> 41:51.925
Over lil' leon?

41:52.010 --> 41:56.712
You see, that's the difference
between me and you, drew.

41:56.815 --> 41:59.098

41:59.184 --> 42:02.652

42:04.189 --> 42:06.022

about you, saint?

42:06.107 --> 42:08.741
You was always about business.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.743
It was never personal.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.278
Even when I didn't like shit,

42:12.364 --> 42:15.915
and he did some fucked up shit,
but I could respect it,

42:16.034 --> 42:18.785
'cause it was consistent.

42:18.870 --> 42:22.956
But now... You breaking
your own rules.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.041
And I can't respect that.

42:25.126 --> 42:28.761
Hope you got a plan, nigga.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.714
'cause when the sharks
smell blood...

42:33.718 --> 42:35.552

42:35.637 --> 42:36.970
(chuckles)

42:37.055 --> 42:41.391

to stop it.
