00:23.880 --> 00:25.632
(Man) Taxi!

00:40.080 --> 00:42.435
- Still pretty thick.
- Sure is.

00:42.520 --> 00:47.435
A real London fog.
Shall l call a cab for you?

00:47.520 --> 00:51.195
No. l can walk it.
We live across the square. Thank you.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.033
- You're welcome, Mrs Preston.
- Bye-bye.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.110
Hold on to Mummy's hand, Alfred.
We don't want you getting lost.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.031
- Yes, Mummy.
- Taxi!

01:01.120 --> 01:03.793
(Woman) Taxi!
(Man) Taxi!

01:23.080 --> 01:24.877
(Faint tapping)

01:25.960 --> 01:27.916
(Tapping becomes louder)

01:39.480 --> 01:41.232
Oh.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.469
<i>(Echoing high voice) Mrs Preston.</i>

02:07.680 --> 02:09.636
<i>Over here.</i>

02:13.080 --> 02:18.916
<i>So close l could reach out</i>
<i>and put my hands on your throat.</i>

02:20.680 --> 02:24.070
- Who are you?
- <i>Here.</i>

02:25.600 --> 02:28.239
<i>Over here now, Mrs Preston.</i>

02:28.320 --> 02:31.118
<i>By the statue of your late president.</i>

02:33.440 --> 02:36.591
Who are you? What do you want?

02:36.680 --> 02:40.036
<i>You'll know when the time comes,</i>
<i>Mrs Preston,</i>

02:40.120 --> 02:42.998
<i>just before l kill you.</i>

02:55.240 --> 03:00.189
<i>Careful, Mrs Preston.</i>
<i>l wouldn't want you to get hurt.</i>

03:00.280 --> 03:02.748
<i>Not yet.</i>

04:24.920 --> 04:26.876
Nora! Nora!

04:31.720 --> 04:35.190
Nora won the lrish Sweep and left.
l'm the new maid.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.590
- Oh, Tony.
- What is it? Swallowed too much fog?

04:38.680 --> 04:43.231
l've never been so frightened.
l couldn't even scream. l just ran.

04:43.320 --> 04:47.154
You've no idea. lt was horrible.
He said he was going to kill me.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.912
- Who said?
- A man.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.877
- What man?
- l don't know.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.838
- You don't know?
- l couldn't see him.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.310
All l heard was a horrible voice
coming out of the fog.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.755
First it was this side, then that side.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.673
lt was high and sing-song.
Like a puppet's.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.756
Like a puppet?

05:06.920 --> 05:11.516
Promise you won't hit me?
Someone's been pulling your leg.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.434
- There was a man. l heard him.
- l'm sure you did, darling.

05:15.520 --> 05:19.752
He's laughing his head off at the local
with the other members of the club.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.314
- What club?
- Look, darling...

05:23.400 --> 05:26.949
Whenever there's a thick fog
in London - a peasouper -

05:27.040 --> 05:29.759
practical jokers crawl out of the woodwork.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.796
Wait till you see the morning's papers.

05:31.880 --> 05:36.192
Dozens of ladies will have complained
about invisible goblins in Hyde Park

05:36.280 --> 05:40.478
and 100 to one there'll be a bedpan
on top of Nelson's Column.

05:40.560 --> 05:45.793
But he called me Mrs Preston
and he knew l was an American. How?

05:45.880 --> 05:50.749
How do you climb Nelson's Column?
Practical jokers have talents.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.195
Not commendable, but highly special.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.833
Well, l can't believe it. ls it true?

05:58.920 --> 06:02.071
Of course.
How do you think l lost my hat?

06:02.160 --> 06:03.513
Hat?

06:03.600 --> 06:08.230
Yes. Barrelling down Piccadilly
at two miles an hour, black as ink,

06:08.320 --> 06:10.356
l stuck my head out of the window

06:10.440 --> 06:14.149
and a hand lifted
my brand-new homburg off my head.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.994
A grateful voice murmured,
''Much obliged, guv'nor.''

06:19.800 --> 06:22.758
He might well have been.
That hat cost me Â£10.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.316
This is incredible.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.476
l'm sorry you were scared, darling.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.397
Even sorrier about my hat.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.555
You've got lots of hats.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.074
(Chuckles) Let's have a drink.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.031
Well, l need something.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.998
- Straighten everything out at the Embassy?
- Finally.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.629
They do a lot of lost passports.
l'll get mine next week.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.837
Good. That'll save us trouble in ltaly.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.388
- ltaly?
- Yes. On our way to Venice.

06:56.560 --> 07:00.838
Venice! Oh, Tony! Do you mean it?

07:00.920 --> 07:04.230
Three short months ago
l promised you a honeymoon.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.276
Every day's been a honeymoon.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.670
You've never felt married to a corporation?

07:09.760 --> 07:12.433
Well, now that you asked, yes.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.750
Darling, when do we leave?

07:14.840 --> 07:18.469
21st. l booked a gondola for midnight.
Can you make it?

07:21.040 --> 07:23.395
(English accent) l think so, ducks.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.275
To Venice.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.112
To us.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.359
lt's a ruddy shame, if you ask me.

07:56.440 --> 08:00.877
- No respect for English heroes.
- What happened?

08:01.800 --> 08:05.236
Some hooligans went up in the fog
and painted him pink.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.554
Horatio Nelson, mind you.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.596
Pink.

08:41.559 --> 08:44.552
Here we are, ma'am. Preston Building.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.279
That'll be eight and six, ma'am.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.316
Eight and six...

08:50.360 --> 08:52.999
Take it out of this, will you, please?

08:53.080 --> 08:55.036
Add a good tip for yourself.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.788
- Thank you very much, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.438
..someone who knows l borrowed on
the shares to keep the mine running,

09:26.520 --> 09:31.355
who knows that if he can drive
the stock lower, l'll be sold out, ruined.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.230
By ''someone'', Mr Elliott,
do you mean someone here at Preston's?

09:36.320 --> 09:40.313
You hold my note, only the men in this room
have seen my engineer's report.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.472
There's a fortune waiting
if you buy in at the bottom.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.796
We're not in the habit of destroying
the men we deal with.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.395
l don't know. l'm no financier.
Gold's my game.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.278
lsn't that beside the point, Mr Elliott?

09:55.480 --> 09:59.439
Are you going to extend my note
or do you let me go under?

09:59.520 --> 10:03.115
Let me remind you,
you've been granted two extensions.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.431
And we do have an obligation
to our shareholders.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.954
However, we'll see what can be done.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.996
Daniel, see Mr Elliott out.

10:23.880 --> 10:28.078
lf l lose Wiluna West,
somebody's going to pay for it.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.799
- Oh!
- Allow me, Mrs Preston.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.678
- What...?
- Please forgive Mr Elliott.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.354
l will if he's on his way to an eye doctor.

10:43.440 --> 10:47.399
You're looking marvellous today.
That's a most becoming outfit.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.550
You always say exactly the right thing.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.712
- l'll tell Mr Preston you're here.
- All right.

11:06.880 --> 11:10.190
Hi, darling. What do you think?

11:10.280 --> 11:12.953
Don't let Carstairs see.
He has a weak heart.

11:15.400 --> 11:19.632
lt's called Midnight Lace. Do you like it?

11:19.720 --> 11:24.430
At least you'll be cool. No telling
what will happen to my temperature.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.069
lf it doesn't go sky-high,
this goes back in the morning.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.355
You've got a sale.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.034
Hartnell's, Michel. An expensive morning.

11:33.120 --> 11:37.557
Only on approval. l wanted you to like them
before l bought a thing.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.393
- That's odd.
- What's odd?

11:40.480 --> 11:44.792
- l just had a call from Hartnell's.
- From Hartnell's?

11:44.880 --> 11:48.998
Yes. The sales girl said
you'd overpaid her by five pounds.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.193
Oh, dear.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.517
English money gets me into more trouble.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.592
Your inventive mind helps a little bit too.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.636
l didn't want to fib, darling.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.871
l was going to tell you at lunch,
after your martini.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.509
Oh, about that.
l'm afraid it's my turn. l'm sorry.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.275
Oh, Tony. Not again.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.114
l phoned you, but you'd gone out.
lt's an all-day session.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.158
l had a lovely table on the terrace
at Les Ailes.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.196
lt can't be helped.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.999
Come on, darling. Fair exchange.
One fib for one broken date.

12:31.200 --> 12:36.797
- My mistake. Several broken dates.
- ls it really important?

12:36.880 --> 12:41.192
Darling. Do you think l'd give up
having lunch with you if it wasn't?

12:42.600 --> 12:45.160
- How are you, Kit?
- Hello, Charles.

12:45.240 --> 12:48.073
- Are you coming to say hello?
- l was just leaving.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.550
Too bad. The board
could do with a touch of glamour.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.712
- Do you mind if l use your phone?
- Help yourself.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.758
- l'll see you to the lift.
- Goodbye, Charles.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.116
- Will they hold our table till dinner?
- lt'll be chilly.

13:01.200 --> 13:05.159
l've got a better idea.
Let's have Nora fix us something at home.

13:05.240 --> 13:09.028
- Would you rather?
- lt's safer with my temperature up.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.714
This little lace thingumabob.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.717
- Excuse me, sir?
- Carry on, Kevin.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.995
The noon post, sir.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.154
That's right. 500 each way,
Bold River at Sandown.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.391
What do you mean, you can't take it?

13:30.480 --> 13:34.029
l don't care how much l'm into you for.
l'm no welsher.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.598
There are plenty of other firms
where my credit will not be questioned.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.114
You don't think so? We'll see.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.036
(Tony) Anything the matter, Charles?

13:48.080 --> 13:51.277
No. l'm just bothered
about that Elliott business.

13:51.360 --> 13:55.797
- Think there's anything in it?
- l doubt it, but we'll look into it.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.873
(Noisy drilling and clanking)

14:32.240 --> 14:34.356
Look out below! Look out below!

14:40.720 --> 14:44.679
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l think so. What happened?

14:44.760 --> 14:47.513
- What happened, Harry?
- The ring snapped.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.354
Use a heavier one
before you wipe out half the population.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.873
The pretty half.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.959
- Are you sure you're all right?
- No, l'm not.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.508
l'm terribly sorry about this.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.068
l'll get your things for you.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.957
(Woman) Kit!

15:04.040 --> 15:07.316
- What on earth...?
- l'm all right, Peg.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.029
- Need any help?
- No. Everything's fine. Thanks to...

15:11.120 --> 15:13.190
Brian Younger. l'm the contractor.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.840
l hope your building stays up.

15:15.920 --> 15:19.276
So do l!
l'll take these things up for you.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.920
No. No, really. l'm perfectly fine.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.753
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Thank you very much.

15:27.240 --> 15:30.118
l hope you'll forgive us, Mrs Preston.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.952
Of course.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.554
Mr Younger?

15:38.640 --> 15:41.632
- Yes?
- How did you know my name?

15:41.720 --> 15:44.712
l thought l handled that rather brilliantly.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.712
l asked the postman. Excuse me.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.118
- What are you doing back so early?
- What?

16:05.200 --> 16:09.239
l met Tony this morning.
He said you had a luncheon date.

16:09.320 --> 16:12.198
- Oh, that.
- The groom was like a little boy.

16:12.280 --> 16:14.555
The groom stood me up for a meeting.

16:14.640 --> 16:19.668
Oh. Well, don't look so glum. At least
your husband comes home at night.

16:19.760 --> 16:23.469
All l have of Roy is a signature
at the bottom of a weekly letter.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.711
- Try curling up with that.
- Where's his boat now?

16:26.800 --> 16:29.360
Dry dock in Singapore.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.399
For your information, darling,
in the Royal Navy, they call it a ship.

16:33.480 --> 16:37.951
Oh. l'll remember that.
When do we meet this husband of yours?

16:38.040 --> 16:42.431
He's due for a leave in a couple of months.
l hope we recognise each other.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.398
Come up and we'll have a cry
over a hamburger.

16:45.480 --> 16:48.995
As soon as l've posted this -
for Roy to curl up with.

16:50.520 --> 16:54.195
- Oh. With or without onions?
- With.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.637
When your husband's ten thousand miles
away, what does it matter?

17:09.119 --> 17:11.554
- How do, Mrs Preston?
- Hello, Malcolm.

17:15.720 --> 17:19.792
Nora, l told you to go home.
You should not be working with that cold.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.111
- l'll be off in a jiffy.
- Goodbye, Mother.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.032
Thank you. You'll get it back and more.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.759
Goodbye, dear. Take care of yourself.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.638
Cheerio, Mrs Preston.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.632
Oh, Malcolm?
How's the new job going?

17:42.120 --> 17:44.554
Going's not the word for it. lt's gone.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.392
G-O-N-E. Gone.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.995
- l'm sorry.
- There's no need to be. Really.

17:50.080 --> 17:52.355
They were a dreadful bunch of clots.

17:52.440 --> 17:57.230
Nose to the grindstone from nine till five.
l felt like a shoe salesman.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.190
- What are you going to do now?
- l don't know really.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.193
l was thinking of going into public relations.
lt's quite the thing.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.236
Do you know anything about it?

18:09.320 --> 18:13.518
Oh, PR's merely a question
of knowing the right people

18:13.600 --> 18:17.195
and l'm luckier than most chaps
in that department.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.834
Considering everything, you know?

18:21.920 --> 18:27.199
lf you mean you're lucky having Nora
for a mother... Yes, l know.

18:28.920 --> 18:32.879
Well, er, l'm due at the lvy for a bite.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.916
My best to Mr Preston.

18:35.880 --> 18:39.668
Oh... Thank you for everything
you've done for Mother.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.553
l'm very glad she's here.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.392
Bye now.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.595
- Nora?
- Yes, ma'am?

18:55.080 --> 18:57.036
Just a minute.

19:01.480 --> 19:02.913
Here.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.355
l want you to buy yourself a decent coat

19:05.440 --> 19:08.238
and l don't want to see you
until your cold is better.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.676
- Do you understand?
- Bless you, ma'am.

19:14.520 --> 19:19.640
Oh, Lordy. l nearly forgot.
A cable came for you. l put it on the bar.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.597
Thank you, Nora.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.508
(Phone)

19:38.840 --> 19:40.592
Hello?

19:46.800 --> 19:49.439
Yes. Yes, l remember.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.598
What?

19:55.640 --> 19:59.269
What a horrible... You must be insane.

20:03.560 --> 20:04.913
Why?

20:05.960 --> 20:09.191
Who are you? Who are you?!

20:11.600 --> 20:13.352
Who...?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.436
(Buzzer)

20:18.360 --> 20:20.715
- Who is it?
- Peggy.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.313
Peggy...

20:25.040 --> 20:27.713
l brought some pickles to fight the onions.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.633
What on earth...? Kit, what is it?

20:31.920 --> 20:34.832
A man on the phone just now...

20:34.920 --> 20:37.115
- An awful man.
- Who was he?

20:37.200 --> 20:39.191
l don't know.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.876
He told me to listen and then he said it.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.712
Said what?

20:45.800 --> 20:47.438
Just...

20:48.520 --> 20:49.919
filth.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.959
You must have got one of those
telephone talkers with a kink.

20:54.040 --> 20:59.717
l know a girl who didn't get the blush
off her face for a month. Then what?

21:01.560 --> 21:05.348
He said he was going to kill me
before the month is out.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.755
You got one of the less romantic ones.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.751
Oh, Peggy, he means it.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.673
They always sound
as though they mean it, pet.

21:13.760 --> 21:18.595
- But l'm scared.
- Yes, you are, aren't you?

21:20.080 --> 21:22.514
Shouldn't we call Tony?

21:22.600 --> 21:24.875
No... No.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.916
He's at a board meeting.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.152
l'll tell him tonight.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.196
Don't let it get you down.

21:32.280 --> 21:36.159
The man's had his fun.
Ten to one you'll never hear from him again.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.754
That's what Tony said the first time.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.957
The first time?
You mean it's happened before?

21:42.040 --> 21:45.589
- Yesterday in the fog.
- And he said the same thing?

21:45.680 --> 21:49.229
- Yes. The same voice.
- About killing you?

21:50.280 --> 21:53.750
That makes it more important
than any board meeting.

21:54.800 --> 21:58.679
Mrs Preston, can you think
of anybody who might want to kill you?

21:58.760 --> 22:01.672
- No, lnspector.
- Or upset you for any reason?

22:01.760 --> 22:04.035
- No.
- A servant you dismissed?

22:04.120 --> 22:07.749
- lsn't this a little far-fetched?
- No, l don't think so.

22:07.840 --> 22:12.152
A former admirer who may
have set his cap at your fortune?

22:12.960 --> 22:14.916
- No.
- No enemies?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.592
None that l know of.

22:16.680 --> 22:20.639
Not that revenge is often a motive
in these cases, of course.

22:20.720 --> 22:24.952
lt's usually just the impulse of a man
who's sexually off the track.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.913
Oh, no need to be alarmed, Mrs Preston.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.310
They get their satisfaction
at the end of the telephone

22:32.400 --> 22:34.709
by shocking you, making you gasp.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.633
The intake of your breath is like a kiss.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.518
- (Knocking)
- Come in.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.835
Whenever you're ready, sir.

22:43.920 --> 22:49.836
Sometimes l think the Blitz left us with more
derelict minds than derelict buildings.

22:49.920 --> 22:54.198
These phone cranks, for instance.
Our file on them is a mile high.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.589
One of ours wasn't on the phone.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.478
Yes. The park.
All cut from the same cloth.

22:59.560 --> 23:04.111
The fog made him just as anonymous
as the man on the phone.

23:04.200 --> 23:08.398
- Was it the same voice each time?
- Yes. Yes, it was.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.711
Do you recall
any distinguishing characteristic?

23:11.800 --> 23:15.509
Accent, timbre,
some oddity of phrasing? Anything?

23:15.600 --> 23:18.273
Yes. His voice was very high-pitched...

23:19.640 --> 23:23.030
- She said it was sort of ''sing-song''.
- Yes.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.315
Yes. lt was unreal, l thought.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.272
lt all seems so unreal.

23:28.360 --> 23:32.478
- He disguised his voice of course.
- Ready, lnspector.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.835
Mrs Preston, would you sit over here?

23:38.520 --> 23:42.069
Once in a blue moon we manage
to pull these fellows in.

23:42.160 --> 23:46.278
Then we tape their voices on the QT -
in a cell, court, anywhere.

23:46.360 --> 23:49.397
There's a chance
you might recognise your man.

23:49.480 --> 23:51.675
We'll forgive you if you blush.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.672
Some of them
would make Freud sit up and blink.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.992
There.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.672
Mr Preston?

24:05.760 --> 24:11.153
l suppose a man in your position
is bound to have some enemies.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.391
There's a few men who won't
send flowers to my funeral,

24:14.480 --> 24:16.436
but this isn't their cup of tea.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.036
Your wife's in good health?

24:33.120 --> 24:35.873
Yes. Like a young racehorse. Why?

24:35.960 --> 24:40.556
lt's sometimes a factor.
Your work keep you away from home much?

24:40.640 --> 24:45.031
- No more than the next man.
- Much less than it does me, l'm sure.

24:45.120 --> 24:50.274
How does she like London?
Does she miss the American way of life?

24:50.360 --> 24:54.911
lf you want to know if my wife's happy,
l suggest it's she you ask.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.912
- l'm sorry. We have to.
- Mind telling me why?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.834
We waste time looking for
crank phone chaps who don't exist,

25:01.920 --> 25:04.388
except in the minds of unhappy women.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.313
You'd be surprised how far a wife will go

25:07.400 --> 25:10.312
to make her neglectful husband
toe the mark.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.794
l don't think so, Mr Preston.
l don't think so at all.

25:26.080 --> 25:30.551
- Any luck?
- The last was closest, but l don't...

25:30.640 --> 25:33.359
Crowther.
He's doing three years in Dartmoor.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.716
Crowther? Oh, yes. Wild for long red hair.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.716
That's all we can do till next time.

25:41.640 --> 25:45.349
- The next time?
- Perhaps. lf he enjoyed your gasp.

25:45.440 --> 25:48.352
Please, please don't worry, Mrs Preston.

25:48.440 --> 25:51.955
lf he'd meant it,
he'd have done something in the park.

25:54.040 --> 25:58.716
Just one thing. l'd stay out of peasoupers,
if l were you, in future.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.791
Just to be on the safe side.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.994
- Thank you.
- Not at all, Mr Preston.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.559
Bea!

26:53.800 --> 26:56.189
Oh. Gosh, it's good to see you.

26:56.280 --> 27:00.910
- Oh, l've missed you terribly.
- Same here.

27:02.560 --> 27:06.838
Oh, l haven't done this in years.
Not in public, anyway.

27:06.920 --> 27:10.151
There you are.
You've beaten me through Customs.

27:10.240 --> 27:14.313
Basil, l've been one step ahead of you
since you boarded at Karachi.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.356
You're right, by Jove.

27:16.440 --> 27:20.513
Lucky for me it was a jet. One more
hour aloft and l'd have been done for.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.989
l was beginning to tire over the Alps.

27:23.080 --> 27:27.710
Darling, this is Basil Stafford.
You've probably drunk his quinine water.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.189
- My niece, Kit Preston.
- How do you do?

27:30.280 --> 27:32.350
Can l give you a lift into town?

27:32.440 --> 27:34.271
l have a car, thank you.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.316
Wonderful. l'll dismiss my chauffeur.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.709
No, no. You run along like a good boy.

27:38.800 --> 27:42.395
l haven't seen Kit since one
of your countrymen kidnapped her

27:42.480 --> 27:44.710
from my shack in Bermuda last summer.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.756
lt's going to be woman talk.

27:46.840 --> 27:49.798
All right. l'll give you a ring. Claridges?

27:49.880 --> 27:52.519
- l won't leave the phone.
- Dazzling!

27:53.800 --> 27:57.759
- But you're staying at the Plaza.
- lf he cares enough, he'll find me.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.308
- Oh, Bea.
- Let me look at you.

28:00.400 --> 28:04.678
Three months of wedlock haven't
done any harm. You look radiant.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.876
- How's the groom?
- He's fine.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.953
He wanted to be here but something
came up at the last minute.

28:11.040 --> 28:14.999
Ah, the jungles of finance.
Men must work and women must weep.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.629
l used to think Father was eager.
Tony's got him beat.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.995
The office lets us have breakfast together.

28:21.080 --> 28:25.039
Count your blessings.
At least he has an office.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.475
You wouldn't want what l've had.

28:27.560 --> 28:32.429
Three charming lapdogs with no ambition
beyond clipping my coupons.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.080
- Oh, Bea.
- That's it, ma'am. Ten pieces.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.435
The car's just over there. Daimler hire.

28:46.480 --> 28:48.948
A dedicated hunter, the Maharajah.

28:49.040 --> 28:53.192
The trouble was l didn't realise
that all the time l was stalking tigers,

28:53.280 --> 28:55.748
he was stalking me.

28:55.840 --> 29:00.277
Believe me, l was much safer
in the jungle than in the palace.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.233
Oh, Bea. Don't ever change.

29:04.320 --> 29:08.518
l try not to, but the bills at the beauty
parlour get bigger every year.

29:09.600 --> 29:14.037
Oh. You don't know how good
it makes me feel having you here.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.997
Good and safe.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.310
What do you mean? Safe from what?

29:20.680 --> 29:22.796
- Did l say that?
- Come on now.

29:22.880 --> 29:26.395
You haven't been able to fool
Aunt Bea since you were two.

29:26.480 --> 29:30.473
Well, it's just some stupid thing
that's been happening really.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.994
A man's been calling me on the telephone

29:33.080 --> 29:35.514
and saying that he's going to kill me.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.079
Kill you?

29:37.800 --> 29:41.156
- Have you reported it to the Embassy?
- We went to Scotland Yard.

29:41.240 --> 29:44.630
Yes. They're supposed
to be good too. Well?

29:44.720 --> 29:48.554
He's just a crackpot.
They call them telephone talkers.

29:48.640 --> 29:51.757
Oh, one of those.
They have them here too?

29:51.840 --> 29:53.796
Scads of them, they say.

29:53.880 --> 29:58.476
l was once in Dublin for a horse show
and l got a call at the Sheldon

29:58.560 --> 30:03.076
from a man who wanted to dress me
in black underwear...personally.

30:03.160 --> 30:06.550
lt was the most stimulating minute
l spent in lreland.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.192
Oh, you're beautiful.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.277
Oh, Kitten, don't worry about that crackpot.

30:16.360 --> 30:19.557
l'm here
and everything's going to be all right.

30:19.640 --> 30:23.189
Starting tonight.
Tony's taking us out on the town.

30:23.280 --> 30:28.308
Good. Thank heaven
there are no tigers in London.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.475
- ls that you, Tony?
- Yes, darling.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.319
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.357
More.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.351
After l've had a pick-me-up.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.000
l didn't waste my day. lt's already made.

31:03.080 --> 31:07.039
What a perfect wife. How's Bea?
Bring any stuffed heads back with her?

31:07.120 --> 31:09.634
One. She met him on the plane.

31:09.720 --> 31:13.269
- She's bringing a date tonight.
- The stuffed head?

31:13.360 --> 31:16.033
No. An old beau.

31:16.120 --> 31:19.237
You'll never guess. Charles Manning.

31:20.120 --> 31:23.829
- Our Charles Manning?
- The very same. Your treasurer.

31:23.920 --> 31:26.559
l thought his only hobby was slow horses.

31:27.600 --> 31:30.956
- Come on. We're in a hurry.
- Wait a minute, darling.

31:31.040 --> 31:33.508
l've got a little knick-knack for you.

31:35.800 --> 31:38.360
Oh, Tony. What is it?

31:38.440 --> 31:42.149
One of the Crown Jewels.
Don't wear it around the Palace.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.313
l love presents.

31:47.160 --> 31:48.479
Tony.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.676
l'm afraid it doesn't float.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.836
Oh, darling. Thank you.

31:56.840 --> 32:00.116
l'll have the only diamond gondola
on the Grand Canal.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.794
Oh, Kit. l, er...

32:10.600 --> 32:14.957
- We're not going.
- Not for a while. That Elliott business.

32:16.080 --> 32:18.640
And this was just to soften the blow.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.154
l rather hoped it would.

32:22.720 --> 32:27.157
Believe me, darling, if other people
weren't involved, l'd drop everything.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.870
Why don't you go to Venice
as planned? l'll join you.

32:31.960 --> 32:35.236
Take Bea.
At least you'll have a chuckle or two.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.788
That's the way l've always dreamed
of going to Venice.

32:40.880 --> 32:46.079
The moon on the Grand Canal
and the gondoliers singing...

32:46.160 --> 32:49.516
and Aunt Bea beside me, chuckling.

32:49.600 --> 32:54.310
l've got a job to do. You wouldn't
want an irresponsible husband.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.152
No, Tony.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.516
Just a husband.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.190
l'm terribly sorry, darling.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.358
You'd better get dressed.
They'll be here soon.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.556
l'll be up in a minute.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.833
(Phone)

33:22.880 --> 33:24.632
Hello?

33:26.480 --> 33:28.471
Tony.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.199
Keep talking. l'll take it in the bedroom.

33:33.400 --> 33:36.915
Yes... Yes, l am here.

33:37.960 --> 33:40.474
No. No, don't... Don't!

33:56.560 --> 33:59.313
Why didn't you keep him talking?

33:59.400 --> 34:03.757
l couldn't stand it, Tony.
The things he said.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.553
l might have spotted his voice.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.757
l couldn't stand it.
l just couldn't stand it.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.559
Oh, l'm sorry, my darling.

34:17.880 --> 34:21.315
- You've got to do something.
- Yes.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.670
Not at all, Mr Preston.
We're here to be disturbed.

34:27.159 --> 34:30.755
Oh, he did? The same man, of course?

34:31.800 --> 34:34.792
Mm. Persistent cuss.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.474
My wife can't take much more of this.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.632
lt's pretty upsetting, this sort of business.

34:40.719 --> 34:44.110
May l suggest you get
an unlisted telephone number

34:44.199 --> 34:46.760
and keep a record
of everyone you give it to?

34:46.840 --> 34:50.230
l'll call the GPO myself
and make the request, if you like.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.197
Not at all.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.668
Just one more thing, Mr Preston...

34:55.719 --> 34:57.472
Were you there when the call came?

34:57.560 --> 35:01.348
Yes, l was. Why do you ask?

35:01.440 --> 35:06.719
l merely thought perhaps you might have
been able to listen for yourself.

35:06.800 --> 35:12.511
Well, it didn't quite happen that way.
l picked up the extension, but...

35:12.600 --> 35:14.556
He'd rung off, l suppose.

35:15.880 --> 35:19.236
Oh... Oh, your wife had?

35:19.320 --> 35:21.880
Pity. Did she say why?

35:21.960 --> 35:26.476
You know what he's been saying.
She couldn't listen to another word.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.711
- ls that difficult to understand?
- Of course not.

35:29.800 --> 35:33.031
We do have to ask
rather odd questions in our job.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.476
Surely that's not difficult
to understand either?

35:39.880 --> 35:44.908
l'm sorry, lnspector.
l'm afraid this matter's wearing us all down.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.959
Don't hesitate to call me at any time.
l'll see to the change of number.

35:49.040 --> 35:53.033
l don't think Mrs Preston
will have any more trouble. Good night.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.714
(* Romantic dance)

36:07.440 --> 36:11.638
(Charles) More champagne, Emilio.
The whole night's on a filly.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.517
She beat the favourite.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.397
Won me a packet.

36:15.480 --> 36:19.712
Charles must be a very dedicated treasurer.
He adores the feel of money.

36:19.800 --> 36:24.157
Why not? There's nothing wrong about
money that having it can't cure.

36:24.240 --> 36:27.869
Jolly good music. May l, Kit?

36:29.840 --> 36:31.432
Kit?

36:33.280 --> 36:36.397
Oh. l'm sorry, Charles. Excuse me.

36:40.400 --> 36:44.075
- How about it, Bea?
- Not now, Tony. Do you mind?

36:44.160 --> 36:46.515
No. Relieved, actually.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.831
What's wrong?

36:53.880 --> 36:56.519
Did Kit tell you about the man on the phone?

36:56.600 --> 36:58.352
Yes. What about him?

36:58.440 --> 37:01.477
He called again just before
you and Charles arrived.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.312
- Oh?
- lt was pretty bad.

37:03.400 --> 37:06.710
- l phone the police, but...
- What?

37:07.760 --> 37:09.716
lt's rather difficult to explain.

37:09.800 --> 37:14.351
While l was talking to the inspector,
l got the feeling of having to defend Kit.

37:14.440 --> 37:16.476
Against what, for heaven's sake?

37:16.560 --> 37:18.915
The sceptical mind of Scotland Yard,

37:19.000 --> 37:20.638
case histories,

37:20.720 --> 37:24.395
the file devoted to women
who pretend to receive these calls

37:24.480 --> 37:26.948
to get attention from neglectful husbands.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.999
lf he stuck Kit in that file,
l hope you gave him a piece of your mind.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.036
l think he had an idea.

37:33.120 --> 37:37.113
The trouble is that no one but Kit
has heard this man.

37:37.200 --> 37:40.556
l suppose the Yard can't overlook
any possibility.

37:42.080 --> 37:45.516
Tony, would you call Kit a neglected wife?

37:47.240 --> 37:49.913
lt's no picnic being married to an heiress.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.231
l can't run Preston's by remote control.

37:53.320 --> 37:57.279
l suppose there have been times
when Kit felt neglected.

37:57.360 --> 38:01.956
Then it's a good thing you have Venice.
That'll put an end to this nonsense.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.032
There are no telephones in gondolas.

38:05.120 --> 38:09.955
- l had to call Venice off for a while.
- Oh? That was sudden, wasn't it?

38:10.040 --> 38:11.996
Couldn't be helped.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.036
Kit must have been disappointed.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.439
Yes. There was a slight chill in the air.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.951
Oh, Tony?

38:35.040 --> 38:36.712
Yes?

38:36.800 --> 38:42.193
The phone call - did it come before
or after you told Kit about Venice?

38:43.720 --> 38:46.439
lt was after, now you mention it. Why?

38:46.520 --> 38:49.080
Nothing. l was just wondering.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.796
(Applause)

40:06.440 --> 40:08.237
Help!

40:08.320 --> 40:11.118
(Slow footsteps)

40:11.200 --> 40:13.395
Help...!

40:26.280 --> 40:28.236
(Footsteps continue)

40:42.280 --> 40:44.032
(Clattering)

40:54.720 --> 40:56.676
Mrs Preston?

40:57.840 --> 41:00.434
(Kit whimpers and gasps)

41:00.520 --> 41:02.476
(Banging)

41:08.680 --> 41:11.319
(Cries hysterically)

41:24.520 --> 41:27.671
lt's all right, Mrs Preston. You're quite safe.

41:27.760 --> 41:30.433
Oh, Mr Younger... Mr Younger...

41:30.520 --> 41:33.239
Mr... (Gasps)

41:33.320 --> 41:37.677
Please calm yourself. We seem to be
causing you a great deal of trouble.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.991
One of our transformers
has shorted a power circuit.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.036
lt'll be fixed directly.

41:43.120 --> 41:46.396
l was coming up to warn you
when l saw this thing stuck.

41:46.480 --> 41:49.233
l thought you might have started down.

41:51.440 --> 41:55.399
l called down to you, Mrs Preston.
Didn't you hear me?

41:55.480 --> 41:59.029
Yes, l heard you, but l thought...

42:01.200 --> 42:03.156
There we are.

42:04.760 --> 42:07.911
- Oh...
- lt's going to be all right.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.389
All right. Calm yourself.

42:21.440 --> 42:24.398
l'm afraid l don't have my land legs yet.

42:24.480 --> 42:27.392
A brandy might help
put your nerves back on course.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.232
l think it might.

42:33.360 --> 42:35.749
lsn't there a pub around the corner?

42:35.840 --> 42:38.035
Yes. We could go there, if you like.

42:38.120 --> 42:40.076
Yes, thank you.

42:45.120 --> 42:49.796
Come on, Tim. Back to work.
You'll never get that double three.

42:49.880 --> 42:51.836
Give us a chance, old girl.

42:51.920 --> 42:54.957
He'll never get it.
He's been trying for years.

42:58.440 --> 43:03.150
l know how you must have felt.
l've been through it myself in a way.

43:03.240 --> 43:06.038
- Trapped in an elevator?
- Burning tank.

43:06.120 --> 43:09.078
- Mortar shell jammed the hatch.
- Oh.

43:09.160 --> 43:11.594
Strange thing, the human mind.

43:11.680 --> 43:14.240
l think l've forgotten all about it

43:14.320 --> 43:18.598
and then no reason at all
l can hear the explosion...

43:19.880 --> 43:21.836
l can smell the smoke...

43:24.800 --> 43:29.316
my hands start to shake and l'm back
in a burning tank at El Alamein.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.035
Sometimes when l come to...

43:34.080 --> 43:36.389
hours have passed.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.436
Once, an entire day.

43:39.520 --> 43:43.513
And l've no recollection of the missing time.

43:45.560 --> 43:49.758
How awful to keep losing
part of your life like that.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.796
lt's not so bad.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.836
Chaps with me lost all of theirs.

43:57.840 --> 44:02.277
But it has left me with very little
affection for closed-in places.

44:02.360 --> 44:05.557
Elevators, phone booths, that sort of thing.

44:05.640 --> 44:10.111
l can imagine.
ls that why you work out in the open?

44:11.440 --> 44:14.591
Before the war,
l'd planned on being an architect,

44:14.680 --> 44:17.148
but that meant an office and four walls.

44:17.240 --> 44:20.710
l even sleep out under the stars
whenever l can.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.314
Camping trips and things like that.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.633
That's fine if you're married to a Girl Scout.

44:27.720 --> 44:32.316
l'm not married to anyone.
''Still looking'' l believe the expression is.

44:33.120 --> 44:36.556
ln America, we call it ''playing the field''.

44:36.640 --> 44:40.713
Playing the field?
Perhaps l should have gone to America.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.959
- l must be going.
- You won't have another?

44:46.040 --> 44:47.792
No, thank you.

44:47.880 --> 44:51.634
l'm just fine, Mr Younger.
Thank you very much.

45:03.120 --> 45:06.317
- Anything wrong, love?
- Oh, no.

45:06.400 --> 45:09.915
- Pretty thing, isn't she?
- Yes.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.675
- Shall l put the calls on the bill?
- What?

45:13.760 --> 45:17.355
The phone calls last night
from the back. You said...

45:17.440 --> 45:19.476
Yes. Put them on the bill, Dora.

45:19.560 --> 45:21.312
OK, ducks.

45:26.680 --> 45:29.114
(* Swan Lake)

47:25.000 --> 47:26.956
That was marvellous.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.998
Swan Lake always
makes me terribly thirsty.

47:30.080 --> 47:31.957
lt's those long necks.

47:32.040 --> 47:35.476
That will cost you
one champagne cocktail. Come on, Kit.

47:35.560 --> 47:37.596
l'll wait for Tony. You go on.

47:48.640 --> 47:53.111
- Mind if l talk to you for a moment?
- What is it, Malcolm?

47:53.200 --> 47:55.191
lt's about my mother.

47:55.280 --> 47:59.558
She'll have to stay in bed for a few
more days, according to the doctor.

47:59.640 --> 48:03.599
l'm sorry to hear that.
Tell her that l'll call her tomorrow.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.636
Oh, that would be nice.

48:07.040 --> 48:10.715
l wish that a phone call
could pay the doctor's bills.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.234
Ask her to send the bills to me.

48:13.320 --> 48:16.551
That's very generous of you, l'm sure.

48:16.640 --> 48:19.313
There are so many other expenses.

48:19.400 --> 48:23.359
They just seem to add up.
Food, medicine, that sort of thing.

48:23.440 --> 48:28.434
l'm doing everything l can
but the old wallet's rather thin these days.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.910
l'll see that your mother
has everything she needs.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.959
l could pick it up at the flat later.

48:37.040 --> 48:41.397
- l'll save you the trouble.
- l'll see that she gets it, thank you.

48:41.480 --> 48:46.156
Are you trying to suggest
that l might pocket the money myself?

48:47.560 --> 48:52.509
A chap doesn't like to be accused of
stealing money from his own mother.

48:52.600 --> 48:56.388
- Makes him out to be pretty low.
- l wish you'd leave, Malcolm.

48:56.480 --> 49:00.314
You can give orders to my mother,
Mrs Preston, not to me.

49:00.400 --> 49:04.712
l know you've been trying
to come between us. l don't like it.

49:05.560 --> 49:08.518
l'd advise you to stop it or you will regret it

49:08.600 --> 49:11.273
Regret what?
Are you threatening my wife?

49:11.360 --> 49:14.955
- lt's all right, Tony.
- l ought to call the police.

49:15.040 --> 49:17.395
We were talking. What's the harm in that?

49:17.480 --> 49:19.835
There can be a good deal of harm in talking

49:19.920 --> 49:22.912
especially if you've been making
nasty phone calls.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.560
(Malcolm) l don't know
what you're talking about.

49:25.640 --> 49:27.596
lf you're lying, Malcolm...

49:29.200 --> 49:32.158
l don't want to see you around the flat again.

49:38.360 --> 49:43.070
One day you'll both change your minds
about Malcolm Stanley.

49:47.240 --> 49:50.232
- What did he want?
- The usual. Money.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.436
Poor old Nora.

49:52.520 --> 49:56.195
- Did you get your call, darling?
- Yes, it was Daniel.

49:56.280 --> 49:59.670
Something he wanted to show me.
Very urgent, he said.

49:59.760 --> 50:02.877
- Do you mind awfully?
- No, darling.

50:02.960 --> 50:06.111
- Are you sure?
- Bea and Charles will see me home.

50:06.200 --> 50:08.236
They'll baby-sit till you get back.

50:08.320 --> 50:11.198
- Back from where?
- l'll tell you later. Go on.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.919
Daniel did say it was important.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.956
l'll see you at the flat.

50:18.560 --> 50:21.552
- Daniel, did he say?
- Yes. At the office.

50:21.640 --> 50:25.315
- At this hour of the night?
- lt isn't serious, is it?

50:25.400 --> 50:27.152
He didn't say.

50:31.600 --> 50:33.750
(Orchestra plays)

50:54.840 --> 50:57.513
- Yes, Daniel?
- Look at this, sir.

50:57.600 --> 51:01.559
l've underlined the transactions
that l felt required your attention.

51:12.280 --> 51:15.795
This leaves us with thousands
of shares unaccounted for.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.996
Exactly, sir.

51:18.080 --> 51:20.355
ln the neighbourhood of Â£1 million.

51:21.440 --> 51:25.353
Someone's been using the money
to squeeze Mr Elliott out of his stock

51:25.440 --> 51:27.431
in the Wiluna West.

51:28.560 --> 51:32.439
- Do you know who it is?
- l'd rather not say until l've checked further.

51:32.520 --> 51:37.958
l've had the impression for some time that
someone's been dipping a hand into the till,

51:38.040 --> 51:41.999
so l decided to burn the midnight oil
until l was quite sure.

51:42.080 --> 51:46.039
lf you hadn't, he might have gone on
bleeding us dry for years.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.596
Cleverly done, l'll say that.

51:49.680 --> 51:52.069
ln a corporate structure like Preston's,

51:52.160 --> 51:55.277
it requires a knowledge
of accounting procedure

51:55.360 --> 51:57.316
and a high executive position.

52:00.120 --> 52:02.236
(Phone)

52:02.320 --> 52:06.472
- You haven't told anyone else, have you?
- Naturally not, sir.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.992
Hello?

52:11.080 --> 52:13.036
Hello, Charles.

52:13.120 --> 52:15.475
Just wondered if l could be of help.

52:17.320 --> 52:22.110
l didn't suppose that Daniel dragged
you there to interview a new charwoman -

52:22.200 --> 52:24.760
unless she was jolly attractive.

52:24.840 --> 52:28.196
A cable from our engineer
at Broken Hill. Full report.

52:28.280 --> 52:31.636
Has to know by tomorrow
if he's to go ahead. Sounds promising.

52:31.720 --> 52:35.713
Good. l thought it might be serious.
l'll see you at the flat.

52:40.360 --> 52:45.150
No need to tell anybody until
we're sure of our facts. And our man.

52:45.240 --> 52:47.310
l agree, sir.

52:47.400 --> 52:50.995
By the way, Daniel,
Preston's won't be ungrateful.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.832
Thank you, sir.

52:52.920 --> 52:57.311
l consider l have more to offer
in some more responsible capacity.

54:21.240 --> 54:22.673
Tony?

54:25.120 --> 54:28.237
Sorry. l didn't mean
my insomnia to be contagious.

54:28.320 --> 54:32.791
- ls something wrong?
- Just a few wheels that won't stop spinning.

54:32.880 --> 54:35.553
ls it something Daniel told you?

54:35.640 --> 54:38.154
That's one of the smaller wheels.

54:38.240 --> 54:40.356
No reason for you to worry.

54:40.440 --> 54:42.590
Off to bed. l'll join you in a minute.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.159
All right.

55:16.040 --> 55:17.393
Tony!

55:17.920 --> 55:19.069
Tony!

55:23.240 --> 55:25.276
The window. l saw someone.

55:45.400 --> 55:49.154
There's no one there, Kit.
Come and see for yourself.

55:52.480 --> 55:54.630
But l could have sworn...

55:54.720 --> 55:57.234
Perhaps your scream scared them off.

56:01.600 --> 56:05.957
Anyway, no reason why the inspector
shouldn't have insomnia too.

56:08.600 --> 56:11.956
- No, Tony. No.
- Why not?

56:12.040 --> 56:14.395
l don't know. l don't know.

56:15.440 --> 56:19.752
Maybe it was just my nerves.
l've been so on edge lately.

56:19.840 --> 56:23.071
Maybe it was just a shadow
that l saw and jumped.

56:24.200 --> 56:27.749
lt's gone and there's no need
to bother the inspector.

56:27.840 --> 56:29.796
Poor darling.

56:31.680 --> 56:33.636
- Tony...
- Yes?

56:34.880 --> 56:38.190
- You do believe me, don't you?
- About what?

56:39.240 --> 56:40.912
The phone calls.

56:42.840 --> 56:46.753
Course l believe you, darling.
Why shouldn't l?

56:48.640 --> 56:52.872
No reason, darling. No reason at all.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.353
Mrs Corman, please.

57:19.440 --> 57:22.716
One moment please.
lt's Mrs Preston, madam.

57:22.800 --> 57:26.634
Tell her l'll call her back
as soon as l surface.

57:26.720 --> 57:29.917
Yes, madam.
Mrs Corman will call you back directly.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.752
Thank you.

57:40.440 --> 57:42.396
(Phone)

57:45.680 --> 57:47.432
Bea?

57:49.560 --> 57:53.997
Why are you doing this to me?
Why should you want to kill me?

57:56.240 --> 57:58.674
No. No, l'm not alone.

57:58.760 --> 58:00.716
My maid is here.

58:00.800 --> 58:03.189
Hello? Hello?

58:22.320 --> 58:23.753
Mrs Preston?

58:23.840 --> 58:25.398
(Phone)

58:29.360 --> 58:32.750
Aunt Bea! Help me, help me! He's...

58:40.320 --> 58:43.232
Help me! Help me, please!

58:43.320 --> 58:46.471
Help me! Help me!

58:47.720 --> 58:49.233
Hurry!

58:51.520 --> 58:55.354
Hurry. Hurry, please. He's in there!

58:58.320 --> 59:01.278
He must have gotten away.

59:01.360 --> 59:04.830
Tommy! Cover the back.
Stop anyone you see.

59:04.920 --> 59:06.194
Right, guv'nor.

59:06.280 --> 59:09.590
- l'll check the other floors.
- Oh!

59:26.520 --> 59:29.956
- lf you don't mind, young man.
- l'm terribly sorry.

59:31.280 --> 59:33.748
No go, guv'nor. Not a soul.

59:33.840 --> 59:35.592
'Ere.

59:39.360 --> 59:43.239
- All clear back there.
- Who are we looking for?

59:45.080 --> 59:47.833
lt's all right, boys. Back to work.

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.398
Mrs Preston, tell me exactly
how your visitor got into the flat.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.233
- l let him in.
- You let him in?

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.110
l mean, l didn't let him in.
l was running out of the flat.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.475
You were running out of the flat?

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:24.190
Yes. There'd been another phone call
and he asked if l was alone.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.589
l thought he might be coming here.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:31.708
l was very frightened and l ran
and then when l opened the door...

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.756
there he was.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.594
l see. What makes you certain
he was the man who's been phoning you?

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.875
- He called me by name.
- Your name's on the letter box.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.351
- But l know it was the man.
- Did you recognise his voice?

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.468
No. But you said he would have
disguised his voice on the phone.

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.437
So l did.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:01.071
Tell me, Mrs Preston,
did you try to close the door on him?

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:06.915
No. l went to answer the telephone.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.638
Here's a man who wanted to kill you
and you answered the telephone?

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.593
Yes.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.399
But you were running because of the phone.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.869
Yes, l was but...

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.589
l suddenly realised
that if he was here in the hall,

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.989
how could he be on the phone?

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.595
And l was expecting a call from my aunt

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.672
and l thought that she could help.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.751
That makes sense to me, lnspector.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.549
The logic isn't over my head either,
Mr Preston.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.158
Mrs Corman. Do you recollect
exactly what your niece said to you?

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.392
Yes. She said,
''Aunt Bea, help me, help me.''

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.436
What did you assume she meant?

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.829
That she needed help, lnspector.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.829
Then will you explain why the phone
call l received was from Mr Preston?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.431
Well, l was confused.
l thought Mr Preston would know what to do.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.195
You didn't think your niece
was in any immediate danger?

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.840
That the man might threaten her life?

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.674
lt was all so quick. She didn't
mention the man. l thought she was...

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.352
She was what?

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.720
ln some kind of trouble, naturally.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.396
l called Mr Preston, then l rushed
here myself to see what l could do.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.752
May l submit that it might
have been wiser to call the Yard?

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.796
Just a suggestion,

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.839
in case you run into another emergency
while you're visiting.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:46.592
Mr Younger.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.639
How long did it take you from the time
you heard Mrs Preston call

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.676
until you set foot in the flat?

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.957
Oh, l'd say 15, 20 seconds.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.032
- You saw no sign of this man?
- No.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.432
Then you immediately called down
to your men to check the entrances?

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.398
lt depends on what you mean
by immediately.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.675
l made sure the intruder wasn't in the flat.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.399
- Say, ten seconds?
- Near enough.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.473
- And they saw no sign of him either?
- That's right.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:21.396
About 35 seconds to negotiate
four storeys and vanish into thin air.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.553
l didn't have a stopwatch
but it does seem to me he'd be in a hurry.

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.234
He must have been fleet of foot.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.669
Why don't you say what you're thinking?

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.316
- What would that be?
- You don't believe me, do you?

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.029
You think l made him up.
You think l made everything up.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.588
The man in the square, the phone calls.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.319
From the start you haven't believed me.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.675
Now, Kit...

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:56.350
We've delayed
the rebuilding of London long enough.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.192
You may go.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.400
Everything will be all right, darling.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.435
l can't deny that the thought
had occurred to me, Mrs Preston,

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.751
but we have to explore every avenue,

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:19.551
then seal them off
until there's only one left - the right avenue.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:23.076
l'm sorry, lnspector.
l shouldn't have said what l said.

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.075
We'll continue to do
everything we can. Good afternoon.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.151
Please don't trouble.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.434
Tony, l can't stay here any longer.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.069
l can't... l can't.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:52.314
You don't have to. We'll go to Venice
as planned. Away from telephones.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.517
(Bea) That's the first bright idea
l've heard today.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.160
- But, Tony, you said...
- That's right.

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.198
- How can you? What about...?
- Preston's?

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.271
Let it come tumbling down.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.920
Oh, Tony.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.755
- lt's stopped raining.
- Good.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.752
- l hope you have a wonderful trip.
- We shall.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.870
- Thank you.
- You will have it there before five?

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.873
l'll see that your husband's initials
are engraved.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.199
Taxi!

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.436
Taxi!

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.516
Oh. l'm sorry...
No, you first. Thank you.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.989
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:34.234
Good. l like Americans, they're so...
l don't really know why, l just do.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:39.232
Pardon me? Could you tell a helpless
American how to get to Grosvenor Square?

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:43.791
l'm going right by there. We shall
have to change at Hyde Park Corner.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.031
- You just hang on to my coat-tails.
- Thank you.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.273
That's us. Take your battle stations.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.510
- Call a hospital.
- She was standing right next to me.

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.593
- Let me help you up.
- You all right, miss?

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.150
(Peggy) Excuse me.
(Kit) l'm all right, thank you.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:20.597
- You ought to have a doctor look at you.
- No, thank you. l'm all right.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.272
Oh, Peggy.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.555
Kit. l saw the whole thing.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.438
- What's going on here?
- Wasn't my fault.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.513
One second she wasn't there,
then she was practically under my wheels.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.720
- Are you hurt, miss?
- No. lt wasn't anyone's fault.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.837
lt was an accident. l slipped and l fell.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.239
Taxi!

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:45.677
You do want to be more careful
with our weather. All right. Move along.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:02.113
l'd just come out of Carroll's
when l saw you.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.668
l thought we might have tea. l called.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:08.389
Then l saw you fall
and the bus coming toward you.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.471
l thought you were done for.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.752
- Peggy...
- Yes?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.513
- l didn't fall.
- What?

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.428
- Someone pushed me.
- Kit, are you sure?

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:24.511
l felt his hand on my back.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.399
lt was the man who's been telephoning.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:32.519
- Did you see him?
- No, but l know he was there.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.112
From the moment l left that luggage shop...

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.116
l could feel his eyes on me.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.707
Why didn't you tell the police?

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:47.156
They don't believe me.
Not after all that's happened.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.710
You've got to call Tony
the moment we get home.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.756
He won't believe me either.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.589
- There.
- Thank you.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:20.550
- Peggy...
- Yes?

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.434
What would your husband do
if all of this were happening to you?

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.071
Roy? Take me away somewhere, l suppose,
until the man was found.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.475
Just as Tony's taking you away to Venice.

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:40.393
Tony's taking me to Venice because...
because he thinks...

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:45.948
Oh, Peggy. l know the man is real.
l've seen him.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.953
Oh, l wish he'd call right now,

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:52.600
so that you could hear it for yourself.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.559
And tell Tony, you mean?
lt must be awful for you.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.192
Peggy...

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:05.277
- Can't we say it happened that way?
- What way?

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:08.318
That you were here,
that you heard him on the phone.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.993
- Kit!
- Then Tony would have to believe me.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:17.073
lt isn't that l don't want to help,
but it does seem to be going a bit far.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.310
But it could have happened that way.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.996
You were downstairs the first time he
called but you could have been here.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.150
Having tea.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:31.671
Please, Peggy. Won't you help me?

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.955
Please.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.032
Well, if that's what you want.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.356
You'd better brief me.
What exactly does he say?

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:48.110
Just filth, then he says that he's going
to kill me before the month is out.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.838
Pleasant little gorilla.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.993
(Tony) Kit?

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.832
- Did you expect him early?
- No.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.273
Kit?

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.315
- Yes, Tony.
- Sit still. l'll go.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.392
Peggy. You won't let me down?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.718
- Hello, Peggy.
- Hello.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.677
- You been here long?
- An hour.

01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.719
l always forget about that chain.
Any news of your husband's leave?

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:23.759
l haven't heard from Roy for a couple
of weeks. l expect he's at sea.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.391
Doesn't he think it's dangerous leaving
an attractive girl for months on end?

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.756
- Tell Roy that when you meet him.
- l might do that.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.832
- How's Kit?
- Well, frankly, Tony...

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.316
Hello, darling. Everything all right?

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.756
Tony, he called again.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.997
- What?
- Peggy was here when it happened.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.998
- ls that right?
- Kit passed me the receiver.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.356
She heard everything he said.
Every word.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.196
When did he ring?

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:09.360
- Half an hour ago. Wasn't it, Peggy?
- Yes. About that.

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.035
l've been trying to reach you all day.
The phone's out of order.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.153
lt's still dead.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.512
lt's very silly, Peggy.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.479
- l only wanted to help.
- Wasn't that rather overdoing it?

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.516
l'm sorry, Peggy.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.830
l had no right to drag you into this.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.876
Sorry, you two.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.278
Kit? l do think you ought
to tell Tony about the bus.

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.596
What about the bus?

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.873
lt wasn't important.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.474
Peggy seemed to think it was.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.348
l fell in front of a bus, just as it was stopping.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:22.476
You fell? Were you running?

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.154
- No.
- How did you fall?

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:27.435
Someone pushed me.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.829
The man who was here pushed me.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.549
Tony, you've got to believe me.
l'm not lying this time.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.756
You're making it very difficult.

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.549
l don't know why
l did that before with Peggy.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.234
l just thought you wouldn't believe me

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:44.515
about the man and the bus and...

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.831
Of course l would
have believed you, darling.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.357
But did you actually see him there?
The truth now.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:57.116
No, but l know he was there. l could feel it.

01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.156
(Phone)

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.915
Don't, Tony! Let me. Let me.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.956
This is Mrs Preston.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.878
Yes? Yes.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.632
Yes, l heard you.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.352
Well?

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:27.631
lt was the exchange
telling us the line was clear.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.197
Don't, Kit.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.712
(Buzzer)

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.398
- Oh, it's you, Bea.
- lt usually is when l've been invited.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.948
Tea at 3:30, Kit said.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.199
(Sobbing)

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.236
Come inside, Bea.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.397
You're being mysterious.
What's happened?

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.789
Kit had a run-in with a bus.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.474
- She isn't...?
- No, nothing like that.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.272
No. Not now, Bea.

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.276
We've got to have a talk.

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.398
l think l could use something stronger
than tea. How did it happen?

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.957
Kit said she was pushed
by the man who's been phoning.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.589
- She saw him again?
- No, not exactly.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.270
What does that mean?

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.636
This time she only
had the feeling he was there.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.156
Bea, l don't know any more.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:54.233
l don't know if l'm married to a woman
or a girl. l don't know what to think.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.392
l'm beginning to wonder
whether any of it happened.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:00.358
Of course it has.
lt happened just as she said.

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:04.228
That's very loyal of you, but perhaps
it would be better to face the facts.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.075
The facts are that Kit is being tormented
by a sadistic fiend.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.151
Surely you believe that?

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.796
l'm trying to. She's my wife.

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:19.395
l'm sorry, Tony.
l know you've done everything you can.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:23.870
Just now, Kit got a neighbour
of ours to lie for her,

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.997
to pretend she heard the man on the phone.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.354
Oh, no?

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.671
Yes. And that bus thing gave me a jolt.

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.479
Heaven knows what threw her in front of it.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.472
We've got to act
before Kit does herself an injury.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.996
- She'd never...
- She might not be aware of doing it.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.668
(Phone)

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.119
Bea, it's a chance.
You take it, pretend you're Kit.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.919
lf it's our friend, at least we'll know.

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.273
Hello?

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.669
Yes. This is Mrs Preston.

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.716
Yes. l'm listening.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.672
Well?

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.633
Bea?

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.277
lt was him, wasn't it?

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.591
- You heard him, didn't you?
- Yes.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:47.035
What did he say?

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.154
Kit, go back and rest.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.032
Why won't you tell me?

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.032
Don't you know
what l've been going through?

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.719
Please stop treating me like a child.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.234
Bea, what did he say?

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.437
Kit, it's going to be all right.
We're going to help you.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:14.314
Bea, what did he say? What did he say?

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:21.873
He said, ''What time shall l ring you,
Mrs Preston? You haven't called me.''

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.393
Oh...

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:27.112
Oh.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:31.352
He's lying. He knows my voice.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.273
Don't you see? He knows my voice.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.116
He's lying.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.196
Oh, God...

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.390
Tony, help me!

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.672
Tony...

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.912
Aunt Bea...

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.434
(Hysterical sobbing)

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.876
Stop this, Kit.

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.916
Kit, stop this.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.992
Lights, Nurse.

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:13.312
Mrs Preston, keep your head still,
follow my finger with your eyes.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.076
Don't move your head. Just your eyes.
Thank you.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:28.631
- Now the X-rays, nurse.
- Yes, Doctor. This way, Mrs Preston.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.472
Mrs Preston?

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.278
So far l'd say she was
in good physical health.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.316
That's good news anyway.

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.155
As to the other - the phone calls,
hiring a man to make them,

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.196
the feeling of persecution -

01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:58.239
that doesn't show up in a blood count
or on a photographic plate.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.551
She may be the victim
of disassociation of personality.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.949
Living two lives without knowing it.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:08.033
Probably the wisest course
would be a talk with the psychiatrist.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.794
You think...?

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.350
He might be able to uncover
some forgotten experience,

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.432
some pattern
of childhood behaviour, perhaps.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.717
l could give you the names
of some very good men.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:25.430
lt's up to you of course, Mr Preston.
Give it some thought. Excuse me.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.631
Oh, Doctor?

01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.835
Yes?

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.516
We'd planned to go abroad tomorrow.
l suppose that's out of the question.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.397
A change might do her good.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.790
Relax the tension.
Make the psychiatrist's job easier.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.589
l mean, if that's what you decide on.
Excuse me.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.193
Well, Bea?

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.393
Maybe Venice is the answer, Tony.
To clear the cobwebs away.

01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.631
And if it isn't the answer?

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:06.236
We'll do what's best for Kit, naturally.

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.196
- Darling?
- Yes?

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.953
- Any luck with Bea yet?
- Just paging her.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:36.874
Thank you. For Venice, l mean.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.712
Hope you're going to pack that.

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.989
(* Piano playing)

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:49.870
- Hello, love. Gonna have the usual?
- Yes, thank you. And a sandwich.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.838
- Lamb be all right?
- That'll be fine.

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:17.319
- Bea will be here in half an hour.
- Good.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.356
Need any help?

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:22.591
Just like a man -
when l'm practically finished.

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.716
What's the matter?

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.076
l shouldn't leave you alone at all tonight.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:37.516
Oh, darling, l thought we'd settled all that.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.558
- Stop worrying.
- l can call off the board meeting.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.552
lf it's a special meeting it must be important.

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:45.835
Darling, Aunt Bea will be with me.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:48.673
Maybe she'll bring
one of her elephant guns.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.912
- l'll be fine, really l will.
- l'll make it as quick as l can.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.959
l'll go and mix one for the road,
wait for Aunt Bea to arrive.

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.076
(Door closes)

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:42.319
- Odd looking chap, isn't he, ducks?
- Yes. The war, l suppose.

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:45.073
l don't blame the poor soul for how he looks

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:49.392
but a thing like that has been known
to unsettle a man's mind.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.354
- What are you getting at, Dora?
- He's been hanging around for days.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.318
He's quiet enough and pays
when you serve him,

01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.278
but take last night
when Tim and l closed up.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.751
l turned the lights off
and l spotted him in the dark of a doorway,

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:10.073
just standing there like he was waiting
for someone with no good in his mind.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.549
Fair gave me the creeps.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.073
Go on.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:18.072
That's it. What do you suppose he's up to?

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:22.756
A woman isn't safe on the streets any more,
not with all you read in the papers.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:24.592
Eat your supper, love.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:36.675
(Phone)

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.389
Tony, pick up the phone.

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:52.473
Tony, quickly.
You've got to know l wasn't lying.

01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.912
Yes. Yes, l'm still here.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.835
<i>(Voice) Sorry if l caused you</i>
<i>embarrassment he last time l phoned,</i>

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:06.275
<i>but l knew that wasn't your voice.</i>

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:08.032
<i>What else could l do?</i>

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.389
<i>Are you there, Mrs Preston?</i>

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.835
<i>You won't be going to Venice.</i>

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.435
<i>We have an appointment, remember?</i>

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.279
Oh, darling. What can l say?
Can you ever forgive me?

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.990
That isn't important now.

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:48.918
You won't be safe until he's locked away.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.351
How did he know about Venice?

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.556
He seems to know about everything.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.074
Do you think he knows about the meeting?

01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:00.116
Probably. lt was no secret.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.998
Maybe that's what he meant
about the appointment.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.548
He could be waiting for you to leave.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:08.995
Darling, l won't leave you now.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:12.550
- What are we going to do?
- l don't know.

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.753
The first thing is to ring the inspector.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.596
lnspector Byrnes, please.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.433
lnspector? Anthony Preston.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:42.830
Yes. About our friend.
He's just called again.

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:48.678
No, not quite the same, lnspector.
This time l heard him, too.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:52.948
l think he intends to make his move tonight.

01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.477
lt's a good thing he didn't ring later -
l'd have been on my way to a meeting.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:59.755
Yes, l think he did know.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.792
Yes. l'm listening.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:11.193
lt's an idea, but l don't know.
Not unless she agrees.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.996
l don't have the right to ask.
lt's a lot to expect.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:20.433
Yes, l suppose so.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.676
What does he want me to do?

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.638
Can you stay here by yourself
for a minute or two?

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:29.678
But why, Tony? l don't understand.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:34.436
He wants the man to see me go - leave the
building, get into the car and drive away.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:36.875
Oh, no, Tony. No.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.714
l'll drive round the corner,
park and come up the rear entrance.

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.839
- l'll be back before you know it.
- Don't ask me to do it, Tony.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:49.710
The inspector will have the police
downstairs. He won't have a chance.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:51.756
lt's the only way.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.673
All right. All right.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.475
All right, lnspector.
How long will you be?

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:05.313
l'll leave here in exactly two minutes.

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:10.157
Freshen my drink, darling.
l'll be right back.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.238
- You'd better take this.
- That's my girl.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.508
Bolt this after me. l'll be right back.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.514
(Banging)

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.236
(Creaking)

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:36.236
(Crashing)

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:07.836
(Rings)

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.111
(Knocking)

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:16.952
Kit, open up!

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.996
(Ringing continues)

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.952
Oh.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:28.229
Answer it. lf it's our friend,
let him know you're alone.

01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:31.032
Go on, answer it.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:37.353
Hello.

01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:40.396
Yes, l'm listening.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:49.114
He saw you leave and then he laughed.

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:52.795
- What else did he say?
- The same... The same.

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.477
The terrace.
He could come from the building next door.

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.516
Put out the lights.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:14.035
<i>(Voice) l've come to keep</i>
<i>our appointment, Mrs Preston.</i>

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:24.314
<i>Everyone will understand.</i>
<i>lt's all been too much for you.</i>

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.713
Tony?

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.519
<i>Your mind couldn't take it any more.</i>

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:34.594
<i>You threw yourself over the terrace...</i>
<i>with a little help from me.</i>

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:39.119
Tony?

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.639
(Screams)

01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:47.712
(Gunshot)

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.479
<i>(Voice) lt won't do you</i>
<i>any good to scream, Mrs Preston.</i>

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.476
<i>You're a known hysteric.</i>

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.120
<i>You screamed and l tried to pull you back</i>
<i>but you twisted out of my grasp</i>

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:25.952
<i>and you fell.</i>

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.716
<i>And then it was all over, Mrs Preston.</i>

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.792
Oh, Tony. Oh, thank God.

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:36.917
<i>We all meet death</i>
<i>somewhere along the way.</i>

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:41.155
So that's how he did it.

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:43.708
Recordings for all occasions.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.232
Tony, it's the same man -
the one who was here.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.880
Timed his visit badly, l must say.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.076
The police... Why aren't they here?

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.396
l wouldn't do that if l were you, Kit.

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.998
But they should have been here by now.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:17.229
l'm afraid they won't be here at all.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.113
Why not?

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.479
l didn't phone them.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.591
You talked to the inspector.

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.151
That wasn't the inspector.
lt was a girl who gave me the correct time.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.310
ln ten second intervals.

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.750
Come to think of it,
l will be phoning him in a few minutes

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.796
to report an accident.

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:52.199
Unfortunately, in trying to defend
yourself out on the terrace,

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.748
you fell to the street below.

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.477
Tony, what...?

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:01.233
l was upstairs dressing.

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:03.959
l ran down when l heard the commotion.

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:07.999
ln the scuffle, he accidentally shot himself
with his own gun.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.439
lt's even better than my original plan.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.956
What have l done?

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.715
Why, Tony?

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:24.358
Why?

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:30.312
Money.

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:37.034
l had to find a way to put
a million pounds back into my company.

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:44.116
And that's all you ever...?

01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:50.833
Sorry, Kit. There have been times
in the last three months

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.550
when l've regretted
the inevitability of this moment.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.033
(Door opens)

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.994
Peggy... Help me, Peggy.

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.513
Help me.

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:07.433
lt's no use, Kit. Peggy's my witness.

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.789
Who pushed you in front of the bus

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:14.190
and played the recorder
into the phone when l was here?

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.357
We had an unexpected visitor.
Don't worry, darling.

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:23.396
lt only helps our plan.

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.118
(Heavy footsteps)

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.991
Roy!

01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:37.034
He couldn't have known a thing about us.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.557
l've been writing to him, sending him gifts.
He couldn't have known.

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.712
Yet he knew.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:55.637
Tony!

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.476
Get her, Tony. Get her.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.519
Keep that light on her.

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:40.233
Tony?

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:10.355
(Pounding on door)

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.638
Call the ambulance.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:38.756
You're all right, Mrs Preston. You're all right.

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:44.430
Now easy... Let go of the girder.

01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:47.717
Let go of the girder now. lt'll be all right.

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.396
Easy. Don't look down.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.153
Easy, easy.

01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:58.196
Easy now, Mrs Preston.

01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.794
Just a little bit more now.

01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.350
One step... No, don't look down.
A little bit more.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:06.192
Oh!

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.752
Easy. There we go.

01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:20.397
Don't look down. Just a little bit more now.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.516
A bit more.

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:33.871
Rest a moment, Mrs Preston.
You'll be all right.

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.996
Just catch your breath.

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.635
There were too many letters, Peg.

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:43.716
Too many packages.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:48.959
l knew there was something wrong.
l had to find out.

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:55.868
l followed you both for days.
l meant to kill you.

01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.554
l wouldn't talk now.
The ambulance is coming.

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.032
Kit.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.752
Here, darling.

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:16.511
lnspector?

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.559
lt's mere curiosity but would you tell me
what brought you here tonight?

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:22.995
You phoned me yourself, Mr Preston.

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:25.196
We tapped your line.

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:29.398
Just to make sure, you know.
Your last call was most informative.

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:31.596
We also got the correct time.

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:35.878
The world always
underestimates the British.

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:38.474
How could l have made the same mistake?
