WEBVTT

00:03.101 --> 00:04.233
Get yourself

00:04.268 --> 00:06.299
a nice, big
umbrella, friend.

00:06.334 --> 00:08.600
You're in the middle
of a major shit storm.

00:08.635 --> 00:10.700
That gay prick
shoots his mouth off,

00:10.735 --> 00:12.099
and pisses all over the memories

00:12.134 --> 00:14.301
of those good men
that died down at Ground Zero,

00:14.336 --> 00:15.732
and I'm the bad guy?

00:15.767 --> 00:18.967
You didn't have to
beat the living crap out of him.

00:19.002 --> 00:20.167
He's in a coma, you know.

00:20.202 --> 00:21.365
Now, hold on.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.699
A medically induced coma.

00:22.734 --> 00:24.167
The doctors put him there,
not me.

00:24.202 --> 00:25.365
Oh, good.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.933
That makes a difference.

00:26.968 --> 00:28.501
He threw the first punch.

00:28.536 --> 00:29.999
You got a witness to that?

00:30.034 --> 00:31.433
There were plenty of guys
down there

00:31.468 --> 00:32.497
that saw what happened.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.800
I'm sure one of them
will step up.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.233
You better hope.

00:36.269 --> 00:38.446
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

00:38.476 --> 00:40.133
Mayor's office
is sniffing around,

00:40.169 --> 00:41.166
newspapers...

00:41.201 --> 00:42.700
Headquarters
will cut you loose,

00:42.735 --> 00:44.132
use you as an example

00:44.167 --> 00:47.034
to show that they're not afraid
to discipline a senior officer.

00:48.667 --> 00:50.467
This could be it for you, pal.

00:50.502 --> 00:52.151
Can't you call somebody?

00:52.186 --> 00:53.800
I called
everybody I know.

00:53.835 --> 00:55.334
You call somebody.

00:55.369 --> 00:56.834
Like a good lawyer.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.001
Meeting's over.

01:02.533 --> 01:03.867
Look, chief, you got to--

01:03.902 --> 01:05.200
I said, the meeting's over.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:17.533 --> 01:20.334
"Crash! The sky is falling.

01:20.369 --> 01:21.432
"Crash!

01:21.467 --> 01:23.700
"A shower of glass and fire.

01:23.735 --> 01:24.665
"Crash!

01:24.700 --> 01:26.099
"My maker's calling,

01:26.134 --> 01:28.433
but I won't answer
his heavenly choir."

01:31.634 --> 01:33.201
Another "crash"?

01:33.236 --> 01:34.368
One more.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.268
Across the line!
Let's go!

01:50.034 --> 01:51.067
Two-line pass!

01:51.102 --> 01:52.500
Change!

01:55.901 --> 01:57.400
Hey, watch this kid
right here.

01:57.435 --> 01:58.934
Right here. Number 12.

01:58.969 --> 01:59.999
He's fast.

02:00.034 --> 02:01.167
He skates good.

02:01.202 --> 02:02.398
Nice move.

02:02.433 --> 02:04.268
Put it in,
put it in, put it in.

02:04.303 --> 02:05.866
Nice!

02:05.901 --> 02:08.270
- That's why we don't have probies.
- Why ?

02:08.291 --> 02:09.810
They all think
they're frickin' Bobby Orr.

02:09.835 --> 02:10.951
Guess what.

02:10.985 --> 02:12.032
They're not.

02:12.067 --> 02:13.850
Kid got his first grab
last week.

02:13.885 --> 02:15.599
One month out of probie school.

02:15.634 --> 02:18.034
If he pulled me out of the fire,
I'd give a shit.

02:18.069 --> 02:19.351
The annual cop game's
coming up.

02:19.386 --> 02:20.634
We've lost
two years in a row.

02:20.669 --> 02:21.599
All right?

02:21.634 --> 02:22.800
I'm not losing again.

02:22.835 --> 02:23.932
I need kids with balls,

02:23.967 --> 02:25.432
not kids who skate
with blinders on.

02:25.467 --> 02:27.201
Kid's got balls.
He just needs some coaching.

02:27.236 --> 02:28.166
Well, you coach him.

02:28.201 --> 02:29.400
I'm here
to beat the cops.

02:29.435 --> 02:30.365
Look, me and you,

02:30.400 --> 02:31.700
we're co-captains,
right?

02:31.735 --> 02:33.067
There's no you.
There's me.

02:33.102 --> 02:34.400
I have 14 years
on this team,

02:34.435 --> 02:35.532
five more than you.

02:35.567 --> 02:36.734
That means
I got seniority.

02:36.769 --> 02:37.765
Yeah?

02:37.800 --> 02:39.400
We both got As on our chest,
okay?

02:39.435 --> 02:40.899
Yours got voted on, all right?

02:40.934 --> 02:42.901
As far as I'm concerned,
the A is honorary.

02:42.936 --> 02:44.167
Might as well
stand for "asshole."

02:45.834 --> 02:47.665
Hey, 12!
Change it up!

02:47.700 --> 02:49.100
All I'm saying,
the kid's got speed.

02:49.135 --> 02:50.518
We ain't getting
any younger, you know?

02:50.560 --> 02:53.030
Yeah, you're out there huffing
and puffing like the big bad wolf.

02:53.070 --> 02:54.134
Oh, and you're not, huh?

02:54.169 --> 02:55.099
Yeah.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.099
Hey, rook,
you're done.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.301
Leave your jersey
in the locker room.

02:58.336 --> 02:59.465
What did I tell you, huh?

02:59.500 --> 03:01.368
You ain't skating alone
out there.

03:01.403 --> 03:02.498
Keep the jersey

03:02.533 --> 03:04.033
and show up
for the game anyway.

03:04.068 --> 03:05.901
All right, but he
just told me to--

03:05.936 --> 03:07.734
What did I just tell you?
Now, screw.

03:15.446 --> 03:18.646
KANSAS

03:57.800 --> 03:59.166
Calm down, huh?

03:59.201 --> 04:00.467
You're gonna be fine.

04:00.502 --> 04:01.699
Calm down, my ass.

04:01.734 --> 04:03.734
Pencil pushers downtown,
the red tape,

04:03.769 --> 04:05.699
it'll be months before
you hear anything.

04:05.734 --> 04:07.800
By that time, the whole thing
will have blown over.

04:07.835 --> 04:09.233
I don't know.

04:09.268 --> 04:11.867
The Grinch is making this sound
like it's the end of the world.

04:11.902 --> 04:13.132
Well, he would.

04:13.167 --> 04:15.834
I mean, so this gay guy's
in a medically induced coma.

04:15.869 --> 04:18.166
Billy's been in one of those
for years.

04:18.202 --> 04:19.498
Hello?

04:19.533 --> 04:20.999
See what I mean?

04:21.034 --> 04:23.201
You're gonna be okay.

04:23.236 --> 04:25.433
Thanks, Lou.

04:25.468 --> 04:28.333
Hmm.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.567
This is bullshit,
Tommy.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.732
Yeah, I know, I know.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.067
We need that probie.
He's fast.

04:32.102 --> 04:33.167
I'm working on it,
okay?

04:34.433 --> 04:35.532
Yeah?

04:35.567 --> 04:36.565
Tommy, hey.

04:36.600 --> 04:37.733
It's your brother
Johnny.

04:37.768 --> 04:38.984
Listen, man,
you got to lay

04:39.019 --> 04:40.359
a little cash down
on Damian.

04:40.394 --> 04:41.930
- Catch up with you later.
- What?

04:41.965 --> 04:43.432
Look, he says
he knows for a fact

04:43.467 --> 04:45.533
his computer virus
screwed up Roger's office

04:45.568 --> 04:46.532
for at least three days,

04:46.567 --> 04:47.832
and he deserves
to be compensated.

04:47.867 --> 04:50.334
What, I have to be the bagman
for my own godson?

04:50.369 --> 04:51.732
Yeah. Five bills, bro.

04:51.767 --> 04:54.017
F--? Five bills?
Forget about it.

04:54.052 --> 04:55.876
Tell him to kiss
my white Irish ass.

04:55.911 --> 04:57.665
I'm not paying
this guy 500 bucks.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.767
What is he, nuts?
The balls on this kid.

04:59.802 --> 05:01.834
Yeah, well, he says
if you don't pay up,

05:01.869 --> 05:02.834
he's gonna
tell his mother.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.501
How's that?

05:04.536 --> 05:05.918
Goddamn it.

05:05.953 --> 05:07.266
All right.

05:07.301 --> 05:09.134
Tell him I'll pay it.

05:09.169 --> 05:10.233
Oh!

05:10.268 --> 05:11.901
Sorry, Gavin.
I didn't see you there.

05:11.936 --> 05:12.932
Son of a bitch.

05:12.967 --> 05:14.450
That was a good choice,
you know?

05:14.485 --> 05:16.126
Drop the cabbage off
this afternoon.

05:16.161 --> 05:17.767
- He'll be home after 3.
- All right, fine.

05:17.802 --> 05:19.866
Hey, you, uh...?

05:19.901 --> 05:22.101
You talked to Dad
lately?

05:22.136 --> 05:24.266
- No. Why?
- Give him a call.

05:24.301 --> 05:26.467
I talked to him last week.
He sounded strange.

05:26.502 --> 05:27.532
Strange how?

05:27.567 --> 05:29.365
Tommy, just give him
a call, all right?

05:29.400 --> 05:31.934
- All right.
- All right. Talk to you later. Bye.

05:31.969 --> 05:33.233
Uh-huh.

05:33.268 --> 05:34.565
See you, guys.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.334
- Yeah, see you.
- Yeah.

05:44.667 --> 05:45.767
Hey.

05:45.802 --> 05:46.832
Hey.

05:46.867 --> 05:47.867
How's it going?

05:47.902 --> 05:49.032
Great.

05:49.067 --> 05:50.398
Andrew. Andy.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.516
Yeah, yeah.
I remember.

05:51.551 --> 05:52.600
What are you
doing here?

05:52.635 --> 05:53.632
Waiting for you.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.101
What's up
with dinner?

05:55.136 --> 05:56.398
What?

05:56.433 --> 05:57.699
Our dinner.

05:57.734 --> 05:58.834
We haven't scheduled it yet.

05:58.869 --> 05:59.899
Hey, listen,

05:59.934 --> 06:01.533
you got to let me
buy you dinner.

06:01.568 --> 06:02.565
You saved my life.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.500
So, uh, how's
your week looking?

06:05.535 --> 06:07.151
Bad.

06:07.186 --> 06:08.732
Aw.

06:08.767 --> 06:09.732
Yeah, I-I-I got this--

06:09.767 --> 06:11.683
I just made
the department hockey team,

06:11.718 --> 06:13.459
and I got this big game
against the cops,

06:13.494 --> 06:15.201
and I got practice,
and all kinds of--

06:15.236 --> 06:16.235
Mm. Mm-hmm.

06:16.270 --> 06:17.234
It's just bad.

06:17.269 --> 06:18.199
Busy guy.

06:18.234 --> 06:19.467
Hey, don't worry
about it, buddy.

06:19.502 --> 06:20.734
It's okay.
I'll just, uh...

06:20.769 --> 06:21.932
I'll check back in next week

06:21.967 --> 06:23.867
and see how your schedule is,
okay?

06:23.902 --> 06:24.932
I'll call you.

06:24.967 --> 06:26.134
You have my number?

06:26.169 --> 06:27.099
Yeah.

06:27.134 --> 06:28.333
I got your cell phone.

06:28.368 --> 06:30.134
Why, do you have a home phone?

06:30.169 --> 06:31.166
No.

06:31.201 --> 06:33.184
Um, I can't afford it.

06:33.219 --> 06:35.167
Good luck with your game.

06:35.202 --> 06:36.634
Yeah.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.367
You're the best.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.334
I'll call you.

06:49.734 --> 06:52.533
Three and two
is the count.

06:54.901 --> 06:56.250
Yeah.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.565
Hey, Dad.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.600
Oh, how you doing,
Tommy?

06:58.635 --> 06:59.565
Good.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.967
Yeah, you want to talk
to your mother?

07:02.002 --> 07:03.700
- Is she good?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:03.735 --> 07:05.534
She's upstairs.

07:05.569 --> 07:07.299
How you doing?

07:07.334 --> 07:09.132
Oh, I'm doing good.

07:09.167 --> 07:12.667
I'm just watching the Astros
get the shit kicked out of them.

07:12.702 --> 07:14.067
Great. Clemens pitching?

07:14.102 --> 07:15.665
No, no, uh...

07:15.700 --> 07:17.901
that other piece of shit is,
Pettit.

07:17.936 --> 07:19.032
Couple of mutts.

07:19.067 --> 07:21.334
I hope the two of them
get skin cancer.

07:21.369 --> 07:22.899
Not enough to kill 'em.

07:22.934 --> 07:25.433
Just enough to keep them
out of the lineup for a while.

07:25.468 --> 07:26.699
I don't know, Dad.

07:26.734 --> 07:28.268
I think
most ballplayers nowadays

07:28.303 --> 07:29.667
wear sunscreen, you know?

07:29.702 --> 07:32.166
Well, okay, then.

07:32.201 --> 07:33.600
I'll call you in a couple days.

07:33.635 --> 07:34.751
All right?

07:34.786 --> 07:35.867
Okay, son.

07:35.902 --> 07:36.734
Bye.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.467
...reports
and warnings...

07:40.502 --> 07:41.700
Hey, how'd it go?

07:41.735 --> 07:42.866
Good.

07:42.901 --> 07:44.132
Well, pretty good.

07:44.167 --> 07:45.767
Captain of the team's
kind of a jerk.

07:45.802 --> 07:46.932
Yeah. Tommy?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.101
No, the other guy.

07:48.136 --> 07:49.500
And Tommy.

07:49.535 --> 07:50.532
Oh.

07:50.567 --> 07:51.599
I like hockey.

07:51.634 --> 07:52.634
I could never play,
though.

07:52.669 --> 07:53.999
I got weak ankles.

07:54.034 --> 07:56.034
That's not the only thing
you got that's weak.

07:56.069 --> 07:57.101
What does that mean?

07:57.136 --> 07:58.066
Nothing.

07:58.101 --> 07:59.151
No, what does that mean?

07:59.186 --> 08:00.166
It was a joke, Shum.

08:00.201 --> 08:01.201
Well, what are you
saying?

08:01.236 --> 08:02.201
Like, I got weak knees?

08:02.236 --> 08:03.166
No.

08:03.201 --> 08:04.365
Arms? What?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.133
I was talking
about your mind.

08:06.168 --> 08:07.867
I'm saying you got a weak mind.

08:07.902 --> 08:09.166
You know what, Franco?

08:09.201 --> 08:11.166
Do I piss all over you
all the time?

08:11.201 --> 08:12.834
I don't understand
why you're such a prick.

08:12.869 --> 08:14.433
Hey, girls, do I have to
separate you?

08:14.468 --> 08:15.999
He said I had a weak mind, Lou.

08:16.034 --> 08:17.934
Yeah, like he's pulling that
out of thin air.

08:17.969 --> 08:19.132
PTSD?

08:19.167 --> 08:20.600
What's this bullshit?

08:22.467 --> 08:23.899
"Headquarters is sponsoring

08:23.934 --> 08:25.498
"a post-traumatic
stress disorder seminar.

08:25.533 --> 08:27.268
"If anybody would like
to discuss their feelings

08:27.303 --> 08:28.233
"about 9/11

08:28.268 --> 08:29.834
"with members
of the general public--"

08:29.869 --> 08:31.699
Let me see that.

08:31.734 --> 08:33.567
You know, like this
is going to help anybody.

08:33.602 --> 08:35.698
Bunch of goddamn crybabies.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.520
Probably still broken up
about the Hindenburg going down.

08:39.234 --> 08:40.832
Hey, what's the Hindenburg?

08:40.866 --> 08:43.567
It's, uh, one of
the space shuttles?

08:43.602 --> 08:44.765
Hmm.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.301
Gentlemen of the jury,
I rest my case.

08:49.467 --> 08:50.967
What jury?

08:58.201 --> 09:00.467
Damian?

09:02.201 --> 09:03.467
Hello?

09:05.667 --> 09:07.034
Damian?

09:09.600 --> 09:10.800
Hey, Uncle Tommy.

09:10.835 --> 09:11.765
Jesus.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.999
You scared me.

09:13.034 --> 09:14.301
Hey, is your mom home?

09:14.336 --> 09:15.465
Not yet.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.101
So how about that virus, huh?

09:17.136 --> 09:19.318
Am I good or what?

09:19.353 --> 09:21.465
Yeah, that was great.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.901
I just sent
a second virus through.

09:22.936 --> 09:24.201
That's two more days of misery

09:24.236 --> 09:25.599
for Roger.

09:25.634 --> 09:27.268
Oh, and the second one's
on the house.

09:27.303 --> 09:28.967
- No charge.
- Heh.

09:29.002 --> 09:29.834
So...

09:31.500 --> 09:32.500
got my money?

09:32.535 --> 09:33.934
Well...

09:35.533 --> 09:37.066
I appreciate what you did.

09:37.101 --> 09:39.967
You did a great job for me,
and, uh, it was terrific,

09:40.002 --> 09:42.334
but, uh,
I'm not giving you the money.

09:42.369 --> 09:43.685
And I'll
tell you what,

09:43.720 --> 09:44.966
it's not
about the cash.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.400
It's about
the principle of the thing.

09:46.435 --> 09:47.632
I'm your godfather.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.400
I'm in charge
of keeping track of you now,

09:49.435 --> 09:51.099
and making sure
you do the right thing,

09:51.138 --> 09:53.620
and the right thing
in this particular circumstance

09:53.669 --> 09:55.411
is not to give you the money.

09:55.669 --> 09:56.533
Cool?

09:58.101 --> 09:59.484
Great.

09:59.519 --> 10:00.832
See you.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.767
I'm telling my mom.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.066
Okay.

10:06.101 --> 10:07.599
Let me explain this again.

10:07.634 --> 10:09.567
Um, I'll tell you what I'll do.

10:09.602 --> 10:11.465
I'll-- I'll give you the money,

10:11.500 --> 10:13.334
but I'm not gonna
physically give it to you.

10:13.369 --> 10:14.866
I'm gonna put it
into an account,

10:14.901 --> 10:17.301
and when you're 18 years old,
you can do whatever you want.

10:17.336 --> 10:18.732
Mm.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.034
I'm gonna call her right now.

10:20.069 --> 10:21.301
All right. Put that away.

10:21.336 --> 10:23.498
Look, you asked me

10:23.533 --> 10:24.600
to do something illegal.

10:24.635 --> 10:25.699
I did it.

10:25.734 --> 10:27.900
Now you got to pay me.

10:27.935 --> 10:30.067
I'm not paying you.

10:30.102 --> 10:31.199
Oh, no?

10:31.234 --> 10:34.268
Well, my mom
is the least of your worries.

10:34.303 --> 10:35.532
Oh, really?

10:35.567 --> 10:37.234
Yeah, there's
the legal system,

10:37.269 --> 10:38.368
and the fire department.

10:38.403 --> 10:39.734
Oh, and Aunt Janet.

10:41.067 --> 10:43.901
She'd be pissed
if she found out.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.134
You want some yogurt?

10:47.001 --> 10:50.201
I can only get 300 bucks
out of the ATM.

10:50.236 --> 10:51.732
That's okay.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.467
You can owe me the rest.

10:53.502 --> 10:54.765
I trust you.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.299
You know what, kid?

10:56.334 --> 10:59.268
I was at your christening,
and I didn't drown you, okay?

10:59.303 --> 11:02.268
So let's think
about who owes who, all right?

11:02.303 --> 11:03.518
Hey!

11:03.553 --> 11:04.699
Hi, you!

11:04.734 --> 11:05.734
What are you
doing here?

11:05.769 --> 11:06.832
Hey, Mom.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.268
Just catching up.
You want a hand?

11:08.303 --> 11:09.400
- Yeah.
- Uh, you know what?

11:09.435 --> 11:10.398
Actually,

11:10.433 --> 11:12.034
I got a lot of homework
to finish,

11:12.069 --> 11:13.168
so I'll leave you two alone,

11:13.203 --> 11:14.568
but, uh,
thanks, Uncle Tom.

11:14.603 --> 11:15.934
Yeah, yeah.
Go Yankees.

11:15.969 --> 11:17.134
Yeah. Right.

11:17.169 --> 11:18.432
Hey.

11:18.467 --> 11:20.350
How you been?

11:20.385 --> 11:22.234
Uh, good. You?

11:22.269 --> 11:23.834
Not bad.

11:25.533 --> 11:27.834
Actually, I suck.

11:27.869 --> 11:29.199
Yeah?

11:29.234 --> 11:30.732
Well, you know, my marriage.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.400
I'm sure you've heard
Janet's point of view.

11:32.435 --> 11:33.417
Not really.

11:33.452 --> 11:34.576
We don't--

11:34.611 --> 11:35.665
Well, I mean,

11:35.700 --> 11:37.567
I see her at the supermarket
and school stuff,

11:37.602 --> 11:39.800
but she doesn't really call me
anymore.

11:39.835 --> 11:41.599
Really?

11:41.634 --> 11:43.533
When's the last time
she, uh--

11:43.568 --> 11:45.050
Uh, Christmas...

11:45.085 --> 11:46.498
but whatever.

11:46.533 --> 11:47.616
It's no big thing.

11:47.651 --> 11:48.665
You know, some people,

11:48.700 --> 11:50.101
they don't know
what to say.

11:50.136 --> 11:51.932
It just comes down

11:51.967 --> 11:54.032
to some good days,
and some bad days,

11:54.067 --> 11:55.901
and some really, really
close girlfriends,

11:55.936 --> 11:57.132
like Lisa,

11:57.167 --> 11:58.967
you know,
that have the time to put in,

11:59.002 --> 12:00.034
because--

12:00.069 --> 12:01.032
I don't know.

12:01.067 --> 12:02.534
I might want to go
to the movies,

12:02.569 --> 12:04.201
or I might get
emotionally crippled

12:04.236 --> 12:05.834
and want to bawl my eyes out
all night

12:05.869 --> 12:06.932
and curse the gods.

12:06.967 --> 12:08.368
Sounds like fun,
right?

12:08.403 --> 12:09.333
Yeah.

12:09.368 --> 12:10.799
Sounds like my life

12:10.834 --> 12:13.800
except the crying is replaced
by whiskey and black rage.

12:13.835 --> 12:15.632
Oh, you drinking again?

12:15.667 --> 12:17.201
No, no, I'm kidding
about the...

12:17.236 --> 12:18.802
whiskey part.

12:18.837 --> 12:20.402
What's this?

12:20.437 --> 12:21.932
An avocado.

12:21.967 --> 12:23.901
Ah, right. Fridge?

12:23.936 --> 12:25.500
Yeah.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.832
Hello?

12:28.867 --> 12:30.334
Uh, yeah,
Dr. Thompson?

12:30.369 --> 12:31.934
It's "Thompkins."

12:31.969 --> 12:33.465
Oh, right, sorry.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.667
Your name's on the crease.

12:34.702 --> 12:35.832
Uh-huh.

12:35.867 --> 12:37.299
I wanted to get
some information

12:37.324 --> 12:39.899
about this post-traumatic stress group
thing you got going on.

12:39.970 --> 12:41.166
Yeah, by all means.

12:41.201 --> 12:42.700
Not that I'm planning
on getting involved.

12:42.735 --> 12:45.434
Uh, it's just, uh...

12:45.469 --> 12:47.651
I was there 9/11.

12:47.686 --> 12:49.834
I'm a firefighter.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.532
Oh, my God.

12:51.567 --> 12:55.234
Um, well, it-- It would be
so incredible,

12:55.269 --> 12:56.333
so helpful

12:56.368 --> 12:57.565
if you would come
and speak.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.201
- I mean, to have someone--
- Hey, what's up?

12:59.236 --> 13:00.634
None of your
goddamn business.

13:00.669 --> 13:02.333
Hello?

13:02.368 --> 13:03.800
What did I do?

13:03.835 --> 13:05.832
Hello?

13:05.867 --> 13:07.032
Anything now?

13:07.067 --> 13:09.266
No, it's still snow.

13:09.301 --> 13:12.034
You got to let me
get you a new TV.

13:12.069 --> 13:13.185
This is ridiculous.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.301
No. Jimmy got that.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.498
Believe me,

13:15.533 --> 13:17.334
Jimmy would want you
to have a new TV.

13:17.369 --> 13:18.632
Okay?

13:18.667 --> 13:19.950
How's work?

13:19.985 --> 13:21.226
It's all right.

13:21.261 --> 13:22.432
Got the, uh,

13:22.467 --> 13:24.800
annual cop hockey game
coming up.

13:24.835 --> 13:27.199
You guys feeling good?

13:27.234 --> 13:28.567
Well, Ryan's being a beast.

13:28.602 --> 13:29.901
That guy's such an asshole,

13:29.936 --> 13:31.251
you know?

13:31.286 --> 13:32.532
Yeah.

13:32.567 --> 13:33.934
He's called me a couple times.

13:33.969 --> 13:35.166
What?

13:35.201 --> 13:37.034
Yeah, last week, last night.

13:37.069 --> 13:38.485
About what?

13:38.520 --> 13:39.866
Asked me out.

13:39.901 --> 13:41.134
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

13:41.169 --> 13:42.333
Don't knock it,
okay?

13:42.368 --> 13:44.600
He's my only male suitor
since Jimmy died.

13:44.635 --> 13:46.699
He's married, all right?

13:46.734 --> 13:49.268
Told me he was getting divorced.

13:49.303 --> 13:50.932
News to his wife. Scumbag.

13:50.967 --> 13:52.333
Oh! Jesus!

13:52.368 --> 13:53.434
Are you all right?

13:53.469 --> 13:54.465
You know what?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.465
Can we just
forget this?

13:55.500 --> 13:56.700
Let me call
the cable company--

13:56.735 --> 13:58.201
No. No. I can fix this.

13:58.236 --> 13:59.667
I can definitely do this.

14:02.433 --> 14:03.398
So...

14:03.433 --> 14:04.767
you dating yet?

14:04.802 --> 14:06.066
Me? No. No, no.

14:06.101 --> 14:09.034
How's, uh, Lisa doing?

14:09.069 --> 14:10.632
Oh, she's fine.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.600
She's out of town this week.

14:12.635 --> 14:14.634
You know what?

14:14.669 --> 14:16.599
You and me?

14:16.634 --> 14:18.867
We should go out on a date.

14:18.902 --> 14:20.401
What do you mean?

14:20.436 --> 14:21.866
Let's go this week.

14:21.901 --> 14:23.700
We'll get dressed up,
go to a nice restaurant,

14:23.735 --> 14:24.866
do the whole
nine yards.

14:24.901 --> 14:26.700
- I don't know. I mean--
- Come on, come on!

14:26.735 --> 14:28.334
Tuesday's good for me.

14:28.369 --> 14:30.132
All right.

14:30.167 --> 14:31.433
I mean, why not? Right?

14:31.468 --> 14:33.333
Mm.

14:33.368 --> 14:34.832
Okay, but I'm-- I'm paying.

14:34.867 --> 14:36.634
Yeah, you bet your ass
you're paying.

14:42.433 --> 14:43.665
Roger,

14:43.700 --> 14:44.700
is your computer on?

14:44.735 --> 14:46.084
Hibernating.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.433
Wake it up.

14:51.800 --> 14:52.900
Hello, Roger.

14:52.935 --> 14:53.968
Hello, Roger.

14:54.003 --> 14:54.966
Another virus?

14:55.001 --> 14:56.901
Who exactly
did you piss off?

14:56.936 --> 14:58.385
Hello, Roger.

14:58.420 --> 14:59.834
Hello, Roger.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.233
Hey, I was thinking

15:03.268 --> 15:04.465
about that
Hindenburg thing.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.301
I stopped off
at the Barnes & Noble,

15:06.336 --> 15:07.266
looked it up.

15:07.301 --> 15:08.901
It turns out
it was this huge blimp

15:08.936 --> 15:10.101
that blew up
in New Jersey.

15:10.136 --> 15:12.132
See?

15:12.167 --> 15:14.234
That's exactly why I'm trying
to read the paper more.

15:14.269 --> 15:15.500
I miss stuff.

15:15.535 --> 15:16.465
What?

15:16.500 --> 15:17.732
No, it didn't happen recently.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.201
It happened like,
way back in the...

15:19.236 --> 15:20.467
In the '30s or something.

15:20.502 --> 15:21.432
Oh.

15:21.467 --> 15:22.832
Thank God.

15:22.867 --> 15:25.067
I wouldn't want to be
out of the loop that bad.

15:25.102 --> 15:26.498
Excuse me.

15:26.533 --> 15:28.500
Is Chief Jerry Reilly around?

15:31.101 --> 15:33.500
The guy said something
he shouldn't have said,

15:33.535 --> 15:34.999
and I took exception to it.

15:35.034 --> 15:37.500
So I went there
to have my say.

15:37.535 --> 15:39.134
He took the first swing.

15:39.169 --> 15:40.734
I threw a couple of my own.

15:40.769 --> 15:42.333
End of story.

15:42.368 --> 15:44.333
Or beginning of story,

15:44.368 --> 15:46.567
as far as the papers
are concerned.

15:46.602 --> 15:48.767
You didn't know
it was a gay bar?

15:48.802 --> 15:49.932
Hell, no.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.365
I mean, everybody there

15:51.400 --> 15:53.267
looked like they were
regular guys.

15:53.302 --> 15:54.934
What the hell
is going on here?

15:54.969 --> 15:56.567
The Bureau
of Investigation

15:56.602 --> 15:58.565
is talking with people.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.700
They are gathering
eyewitness accounts.

16:00.735 --> 16:02.800
That's why I'm here
speaking with you.

16:02.835 --> 16:04.384
A punishment
is deemed necessary,

16:04.419 --> 16:05.899
it'll come
from the commissioner,

16:05.934 --> 16:08.867
and you'll have a few days
to accept or decline it.

16:08.902 --> 16:11.234
What kind of punishment
are we talking about?

16:11.269 --> 16:13.901
As an example? 30 days' pay.

16:13.936 --> 16:15.967
A 30-day rip? Bullshit.

16:16.002 --> 16:16.999
Gimme the paper.

16:17.034 --> 16:18.365
I'll decline it right now.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.834
If you decline,
it goes to trial.

16:19.869 --> 16:21.085
Do you really want that?

16:21.120 --> 16:22.577
I don't really care.

16:22.612 --> 16:23.999
I'm in the right here.

16:24.034 --> 16:25.634
I'll have to take
a more detailed statement

16:25.669 --> 16:26.732
from you.

16:26.767 --> 16:28.400
I've already given you
my statement.

16:28.435 --> 16:30.368
Now you're wasting my time, kid.

16:30.403 --> 16:31.632
I have a house to run.

16:31.667 --> 16:33.550
And if you want to
keep running it,

16:33.585 --> 16:35.433
Chief Reilly,
I suggest you sit down

16:35.468 --> 16:36.967
and start talking to me.

16:37.002 --> 16:38.233
Wake up.

16:38.268 --> 16:40.017
Your job's
at stake here.

16:40.052 --> 16:41.732
Your future,
your pension.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.301
Now, you can bluster
all you want.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.901
This thing isn't going away.

17:02.101 --> 17:03.199
Hello?

17:03.234 --> 17:05.101
Hey, doc, it's
the fireman again.

17:05.136 --> 17:07.165
I'm so glad
you called back.

17:07.201 --> 17:10.767
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't
get back to you yesterday.

17:10.801 --> 17:12.266
So this group...

17:12.300 --> 17:14.416
Yeah, uh, listen,
it would mean so much

17:14.452 --> 17:16.532
if you would come
and share with us,

17:16.568 --> 17:18.233
especially
if you could share

17:18.269 --> 17:19.765
how you've dealt

17:19.800 --> 17:21.034
with the emotional
repercussions

17:21.069 --> 17:22.268
of the attack.

17:22.303 --> 17:23.432
Well, I...

17:23.467 --> 17:25.268
I haven't dealt
with all that too much.

17:25.303 --> 17:27.500
I've been writing
some poetry.

17:27.535 --> 17:29.534
Poetry? Huh.

17:29.598 --> 17:32.782
Well, you see, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

17:32.835 --> 17:33.832
If you could come

17:33.867 --> 17:35.067
and maybe
share some of it

17:35.102 --> 17:36.151
with the group...

17:36.186 --> 17:37.166
I don't know.

17:37.201 --> 17:39.166
It's, um, not that good.

17:39.201 --> 17:41.901
Well, I-I'm sure
It's better than you think.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.385
Would you at least
consider it?

17:44.420 --> 17:46.260
Um, can I get
back to you on that?

17:46.295 --> 17:47.798
You have no idea
how helpful--

17:47.833 --> 17:49.301
Hey, Bill,
what's going on?

17:49.336 --> 17:50.498
Hello?

17:50.533 --> 17:52.301
I was thinking about
global warming last night,

17:52.323 --> 17:53.687
and you realize
they're saying

17:53.716 --> 17:55.832
that Greenland's in danger
of melting away altogether?

17:55.872 --> 17:57.719
So I couldn't sleep.
I'm tossing, I'm turning--

17:57.767 --> 18:00.134
Bill, uh,
I didn't really care.

18:00.169 --> 18:02.467
I'm... sorry.

18:11.201 --> 18:12.233
Some day, Franco,

18:12.268 --> 18:13.700
science is gonna
isolate the gene

18:13.735 --> 18:14.832
that makes people think

18:14.867 --> 18:16.867
barbecuing indoors
is a good idea.

18:16.902 --> 18:18.468
Can't happen
soon enough.

18:18.503 --> 18:19.999
I'm telling you, Tommy,

18:20.034 --> 18:21.532
there's no way
those guys were gay.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.600
They were dressed like
regular guys, like you and me.

18:23.635 --> 18:24.966
That's the whole point, okay?

18:25.001 --> 18:27.034
It's one of the most
famous gay bars in Manhattan.

18:27.069 --> 18:28.568
You said this guy
swung at you first,

18:28.603 --> 18:29.935
he was an asshole,
blah blah, blah.

18:29.970 --> 18:31.268
Was there anybody
who was there

18:31.303 --> 18:32.535
can attest to that fact?

18:32.570 --> 18:33.732
Well, some Italian guy.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.368
- His name is Vinny something.
- There you go.

18:35.403 --> 18:37.299
There's no way he was gay.

18:37.334 --> 18:39.368
You were in a gay bar, okay?
He's probably gay.

18:39.403 --> 18:40.999
You better pray
he was gay,

18:41.034 --> 18:43.433
because you need
a gay character witness.

18:43.468 --> 18:44.398
Why?

18:44.433 --> 18:45.699
Because, to prove

18:45.734 --> 18:47.467
that you're not some
crazy gay-bashing guy.

18:47.502 --> 18:48.334
You know any other fags?

18:49.268 --> 18:50.467
Besides you? No.

18:50.502 --> 18:51.601
I'm serious, chief.

18:51.636 --> 18:52.665
I'm serious too.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.634
I don't know anybody that's gay.

18:54.669 --> 18:56.066
Now get off of my ass.

18:56.101 --> 18:57.834
Go help those guys
take up the line.

19:01.368 --> 19:03.433
Gay...

19:06.767 --> 19:10.867
"Soldiers marching into hells
known and unknown,

19:10.902 --> 19:14.918
"brothers working
side by side armed

19:14.953 --> 19:18.934
only with water, axe,
muscle and bone."

19:25.301 --> 19:31.834
"With axe, muscle,
water and bone."

19:31.869 --> 19:33.166
That's better, baby.

19:33.201 --> 19:34.433
Okay, what are you doing?

19:34.468 --> 19:35.699
Oh, Jesus.

19:35.734 --> 19:37.633
I come down here and hear you
talking to yourself.

19:37.668 --> 19:39.533
You can't get something
off that screen fast enough.

19:39.568 --> 19:40.699
Why do you spy on me?

19:40.734 --> 19:42.700
Why don't you get a hobby?
Knit something.

19:42.735 --> 19:44.667
I know what you're doing
down here, Kenneth.

19:44.702 --> 19:46.266
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.

19:46.301 --> 19:47.967
You think that I don't know,
but I know.

19:49.101 --> 19:50.667
It's porn.

19:50.702 --> 19:52.832
Porn?

19:52.867 --> 19:54.268
That's right. Internet porn.

19:54.303 --> 19:55.618
You're hooked.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.076
You're a pig.

19:57.111 --> 19:58.465
It's not porn.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.901
It's a fishing site,
for God's sakes.

19:59.936 --> 20:00.866
Come look at it.

20:00.901 --> 20:02.266
I'm not looking
at that crap.

20:02.301 --> 20:04.101
You don't need to lie to me,
either.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.034
What are you doing?

20:07.067 --> 20:09.101
Okay, you want the truth?

20:09.136 --> 20:10.134
Yeah.

20:12.001 --> 20:13.268
I've been writing poetry.

20:14.767 --> 20:15.867
What?

20:15.902 --> 20:16.967
Poetry.

20:18.533 --> 20:21.016
Since just after 9/11.

20:21.051 --> 20:23.465
It's kind of been...

20:23.500 --> 20:25.167
I don't know,
my therapy, I guess.

20:25.202 --> 20:26.199
I don't know.

20:26.234 --> 20:27.967
You're writing poetry?

20:28.002 --> 20:29.500
Yeah.

20:31.201 --> 20:32.432
Oh, my God.

20:32.467 --> 20:33.734
Why couldn't it
have been the porn?

20:38.301 --> 20:39.498
Hey!

20:39.533 --> 20:41.301
You are not gonna believe this.

20:41.336 --> 20:42.665
I just passed a newsstand.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.334
I thought you were
gonna let me sleep.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.351
Get up, sweetheart.

20:45.386 --> 20:46.299
You want to see this.

20:46.334 --> 20:47.365
It's The New York Post.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.767
Your dad's name
is Jerry, right?

20:48.802 --> 20:49.765
Yeah.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.800
He beat up a gay man
the other night

20:51.835 --> 20:53.167
in some bar.

20:57.368 --> 20:59.467
Oh, my God.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.034
Oh, you son of a bitch.

21:06.101 --> 21:07.501
Tommy!

21:07.536 --> 21:08.866
Hey.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.132
What the hell
are you doing?

21:10.167 --> 21:11.767
Oh, I got this prick
of a squirrel.

21:11.811 --> 21:13.818
He's eating through my roof.
I just missed him.

21:13.853 --> 21:14.799
What are you doing?

21:14.834 --> 21:16.233
Look. I am so damned angry.

21:16.268 --> 21:17.767
I found this
in Damian's underwear drawer.

21:17.802 --> 21:18.967
Look at this. Look at this.

21:19.002 --> 21:20.166
It's $300, Tommy.

21:20.201 --> 21:21.667
Okay, listen, calm down, okay?

21:21.702 --> 21:23.400
The thing is...

21:25.533 --> 21:27.133
I'm sure there's a--

21:27.168 --> 21:28.699
I think that he's--

21:28.734 --> 21:29.934
I think he's dealing drugs.

21:29.969 --> 21:31.299
No.

21:31.334 --> 21:32.565
Damian, no, he wouldn't--

21:32.600 --> 21:34.650
He wouldn't be involved
in anything like that. No.

21:34.685 --> 21:36.700
Where else would he
get this kind of money?

21:36.735 --> 21:38.032
You're right.

21:38.067 --> 21:39.999
It's probably drugs.

21:40.034 --> 21:41.365
You know what I'm gonna do?

21:41.400 --> 21:43.634
I'm gonna go home and
beat his ass black and blue.

21:43.669 --> 21:45.066
No. You know what?

21:45.101 --> 21:47.101
Let me go over there,
and I'll talk to him.

21:47.136 --> 21:48.700
I'll straighten it out,
okay?

21:48.735 --> 21:50.451
All right?

21:50.486 --> 21:52.132
It's just--

21:52.167 --> 21:54.867
I wish that Jimmy
was here.

21:54.902 --> 21:56.767
Yeah.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.667
Yeah.

22:02.767 --> 22:04.467
So you'll talk to him?

22:05.767 --> 22:07.250
Jimmy?

22:07.285 --> 22:08.699
Damian.

22:08.734 --> 22:10.132
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

22:10.167 --> 22:11.800
Yeah, first thing tomorrow,
I'll talk to him.

22:11.835 --> 22:13.368
Thank you.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.550
You got a ciggy butt?

22:16.585 --> 22:17.967
Yeah, I do,
actually.

22:21.368 --> 22:22.800
Ahhh...

22:25.433 --> 22:27.565
Mm.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.467
Thank you.

22:32.201 --> 22:33.333
Is it just me,

22:33.368 --> 22:34.967
or does it feel
like the whole world

22:35.002 --> 22:37.500
is just falling to pieces?

22:37.535 --> 22:39.500
No.

22:40.934 --> 22:43.233
I know what you mean.

22:43.268 --> 22:45.498
I feel the same way.

22:45.533 --> 22:52.001
Everything that's good and fun,
it's just... sliding away.

22:52.036 --> 22:53.668
You know?

22:53.703 --> 22:55.266
Jimmy,

22:55.301 --> 22:57.234
all the good times
we used to have

22:57.269 --> 22:59.400
down at the firehouse...

22:59.435 --> 23:01.067
that's all changed.

23:01.102 --> 23:02.665
Come home here,

23:02.700 --> 23:06.101
and dealing with this shit
across the street.

23:06.136 --> 23:07.699
I just feel like everything--

23:07.734 --> 23:10.834
everything good in my life
is just...

23:10.869 --> 23:12.199
sliding away,

23:12.234 --> 23:16.067
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

23:16.102 --> 23:18.734
Jesus, Tommy.

23:18.769 --> 23:20.866
What?

23:20.901 --> 23:22.467
How big a pussy are you?

23:24.634 --> 23:26.034
I had something
taken away from me,

23:26.069 --> 23:27.632
my husband,

23:27.667 --> 23:29.334
but the things
you want,

23:29.369 --> 23:30.599
they're here.

23:30.634 --> 23:32.301
All you have to do
is fight for them.

23:34.567 --> 23:36.034
Grow a pair of balls,
why don't you?

23:37.301 --> 23:39.567
And talk to Damian.

23:39.602 --> 23:40.634
I will.

23:54.234 --> 23:55.632
She still looks good, though.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.400
I thought maybe
the sadness of me dying

23:57.435 --> 23:59.684
might have aged her, you know?

23:59.719 --> 24:01.899
I mean, I see a little of that,

24:01.934 --> 24:04.134
but she looks okay,
don't you think?

24:04.169 --> 24:05.532
She's your wife.

24:05.567 --> 24:07.001
I don't look at her
that way.

24:07.036 --> 24:09.166
What way?

24:09.201 --> 24:11.134
Like I look at women
who aren't your wife.

24:11.169 --> 24:12.465
All right?

24:12.500 --> 24:14.101
Is there a bottle
in the living room?

24:14.136 --> 24:15.132
No.

24:15.167 --> 24:16.299
What are you doing?

24:16.334 --> 24:18.134
Stopping the slide,
brother.

24:23.634 --> 24:25.199
So when can you do it?

24:25.234 --> 24:27.301
Um... give me
till the end of the week.

24:27.336 --> 24:29.432
Yeah.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.500
We'll come down,
we'll take a look at it,

24:31.535 --> 24:33.533
and I'll give you an est--
I got to go.

24:33.568 --> 24:34.800
Yeah,
I'll call you back.

24:34.835 --> 24:36.066
All right.

24:36.101 --> 24:37.767
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

24:37.802 --> 24:40.899
What is that?

24:40.934 --> 24:42.199
What, the cookies?

24:42.234 --> 24:44.700
No. Below the cookies,
peeking out of your pants,

24:44.735 --> 24:46.018
and it better
not be a tattoo,

24:46.053 --> 24:47.266
because
if it is a tattoo,

24:47.301 --> 24:49.301
you're not gonna
see the light of day ever again.

24:49.336 --> 24:50.934
It's not like it's huge.

24:50.969 --> 24:52.901
Move the cookies.

24:55.301 --> 24:56.700
Oh, my God. What the hell?

24:56.735 --> 24:57.665
It's a shamrock.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.134
I can see it's a shamrock.

24:59.169 --> 25:00.132
You're always saying

25:00.167 --> 25:01.567
we should be proud
of being Irish.

25:01.602 --> 25:02.932
You want to be proud
you're Irish?

25:02.967 --> 25:04.967
Wave a flag, march in a parade,
have 100 kids.

25:05.002 --> 25:05.932
Not yet.

25:05.967 --> 25:07.150
- Oh, my God.
- Neat!

25:07.185 --> 25:08.299
Can I get one too?

25:08.334 --> 25:10.734
How would you like to eat dinner
in front of the TV?

25:10.769 --> 25:11.699
Awesome!

25:11.734 --> 25:12.750
But we're
not allowed to--

25:12.785 --> 25:13.732
You're allowed
tonight.

25:13.767 --> 25:15.134
- Grab your food and go.
- Yes!

25:16.867 --> 25:18.800
"S & M"? You're into S & M?

25:18.835 --> 25:20.217
What's S & M?

25:20.252 --> 25:21.600
Never mind.

25:23.268 --> 25:25.318
Whose initials are those?

25:25.353 --> 25:27.333
None of your business.

25:27.368 --> 25:29.800
What's the Murphy kid's
first name?

25:29.835 --> 25:30.932
Sean.

25:30.967 --> 25:32.233
Thank you.

25:32.268 --> 25:33.465
Goddamn it.

25:33.500 --> 25:34.966
I knew that kid
was trouble.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.584
It's not that big
of a deal.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.167
Mom has a tattoo
on her butt.

25:38.202 --> 25:39.734
How do you know that?

25:39.769 --> 25:41.101
She showed me.

25:41.136 --> 25:42.535
She showed you?

25:42.570 --> 25:43.934
Jesus Christ.

25:45.268 --> 25:46.432
I'll tell you what.

25:46.467 --> 25:47.867
You're gonna
get rid of that yourself,

25:47.902 --> 25:49.467
or I'll get rid of it for you.

25:49.502 --> 25:50.966
How?

25:51.001 --> 25:52.901
I'm sure Black & Decker
has some kind of attachment.

25:52.936 --> 25:54.066
It's my body.

25:54.101 --> 25:55.901
You can't tell me
what to do with it.

25:55.936 --> 25:57.333
Oh, really?

25:57.368 --> 25:59.368
Let me just remind you
of a couple things, okay?

25:59.403 --> 26:00.765
When you turn
18 years old,

26:00.800 --> 26:03.600
you can move out of this house.
Get a flower tattoo on your ass,

26:03.635 --> 26:05.001
get a rainbow tattooed
on your tits,

26:05.036 --> 26:06.266
but until then,

26:06.301 --> 26:08.500
when you live under my roof,
you play by my rules.

26:08.535 --> 26:09.465
I didn't get it

26:09.500 --> 26:10.901
when I was living
under your roof.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.199
I got it under Mom's.

26:12.234 --> 26:13.634
Don't be a smart-ass with me.

26:13.669 --> 26:15.034
I don't care
what you say.

26:15.069 --> 26:15.999
I'm keeping it.

26:16.034 --> 26:17.034
You're not keeping it.

26:18.301 --> 26:19.533
Aw, Christ.

26:19.568 --> 26:20.599
Hello.

26:20.634 --> 26:22.334
Hey, it's me.

26:22.369 --> 26:23.498
Oh, hi.

26:23.533 --> 26:25.133
Look, I hate to ask you
for favors,

26:25.168 --> 26:26.951
but a pipe is leaking
in the kitchen,

26:26.986 --> 26:28.734
and Roger's coming over
for dinner.

26:28.769 --> 26:30.032
He can't fix it himself?

26:30.067 --> 26:31.799
No. He's not good with tools.

26:31.834 --> 26:33.767
Yeah, that's funny,
seeing as how he is one.

26:33.802 --> 26:36.001
I really need your help, Tommy.

26:36.036 --> 26:38.301
I'll be right over.

26:38.336 --> 26:39.985
Watch them.

26:40.020 --> 26:41.599
So the poetry,

26:41.634 --> 26:42.734
what exactly
are you planning

26:42.769 --> 26:43.901
on doing with it?

26:43.936 --> 26:45.365
Nothing.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.432
But there's
this psychiatrist guy

26:47.467 --> 26:51.734
who wants me to read some of it
to this group he has.

26:51.769 --> 26:52.999
What group?

26:53.034 --> 26:55.567
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

26:55.602 --> 26:56.532
I don't know.

26:56.567 --> 26:57.532
It's a support group.

26:57.567 --> 26:59.483
He thinks
me reading my stuff

26:59.518 --> 27:01.400
might help some of these people.

27:01.435 --> 27:03.001
So are you gonna do it?

27:03.036 --> 27:04.567
I'm thinking about it.

27:04.602 --> 27:05.866
The thing is,

27:05.901 --> 27:08.234
I don't know whether the stuff
is good or not.

27:08.269 --> 27:10.567
I mean, I'm gonna feel
like enough of an idiot

27:10.602 --> 27:11.832
just going
to this thing.

27:11.867 --> 27:14.032
If I go
and the stuff sucks...

27:14.067 --> 27:16.084
Hey, look, if it sucks,
you don't do it, right?

27:16.119 --> 27:18.101
- You don't look like a big jerk.
- Yeah, I guess.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.932
I guess
I'm just looking for someone

27:19.967 --> 27:23.634
to tell me whether the stuff
is good or not.

27:25.467 --> 27:26.767
Well, don't be looking at me.

27:26.802 --> 27:28.132
Aw, come on, Phyll.

27:28.167 --> 27:29.732
I got no one else I can trust.

27:29.767 --> 27:31.532
No one else even knows
that I'm doing this.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.567
Not the guys on my crew,
not my brother, nobody.

27:33.602 --> 27:35.400
I'm not good with poetry, Ken.

27:35.435 --> 27:36.718
It's too fancy.

27:36.753 --> 27:38.001
It's not fancy.

27:38.036 --> 27:39.432
It's not.

27:39.467 --> 27:41.067
Would you read it
for me?

27:41.102 --> 27:42.934
Please?

27:44.167 --> 27:46.932
I did not show it to her, Tom.

27:46.967 --> 27:49.067
She walked in
while I was getting dressed.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.299
If anything,

27:50.334 --> 27:51.632
mine should be a deterrent.

27:51.667 --> 27:53.467
I mean, a heart
with your initials in it?

27:53.520 --> 27:56.610
I mean, it should prove that even
the most well-intentioned tattoo

27:56.660 --> 27:58.435
can become absolutely useless.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.934
Whatever.

28:29.767 --> 28:30.932
So I was talking
to Sheila.

28:30.967 --> 28:32.368
She says you don't
call her anymore.

28:32.403 --> 28:33.532
Yeah?

28:33.567 --> 28:35.368
Well, Sheila's a bitch
who treated me like shit

28:35.403 --> 28:36.565
when we first
started dating,

28:36.600 --> 28:38.117
then acted barely civil
towards me

28:38.152 --> 28:39.634
once you and Jimmy
became firemen.

28:39.669 --> 28:41.132
So her husband gets killed,

28:41.167 --> 28:42.767
and I'm supposed to be
her best friend?

28:42.802 --> 28:44.999
She can kiss my tight Irish ass.

28:45.034 --> 28:48.001
Her and all the other two-faced
hypocrite broads like her

28:48.036 --> 28:49.299
are one of the main reasons

28:49.334 --> 28:51.167
I can't wait
to get out of this neighborhood.

28:51.202 --> 28:52.532
I'm gonna read
between the lines here

28:52.567 --> 28:54.433
and guess what you're
really trying to say is

28:54.474 --> 28:56.870
- "hypocritical Italian broads," right?
- Is it fixed?

28:56.902 --> 28:57.999
No.

28:58.034 --> 28:59.667
Well, you can't just
leave me here

28:59.702 --> 29:01.201
with all the wet towels
on the floor.

29:01.236 --> 29:02.700
Roger's gonna be here
any minute and--

29:03.700 --> 29:04.732
- Shit!
- What?

29:04.767 --> 29:06.167
The tablecloth
is still in the dryer.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.567
Okay, I'm gonna be right back.

29:07.602 --> 29:10.201
Please don't go.

29:11.368 --> 29:12.800
Boy...

29:27.500 --> 29:29.368
And now the dryer
smells funny.

29:29.403 --> 29:30.565
Like wires burning.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.032
Well, so, what about the sink?

29:33.067 --> 29:35.600
Well, it's not fixed,
but it won't leak.

29:35.635 --> 29:38.099
Franco actually has
a plumber buddy.

29:38.134 --> 29:40.134
I'll be able
to get the part that we need

29:40.169 --> 29:41.199
from him, on the arm.

29:41.230 --> 29:43.502
It's actually a pretty expensive part
of the garbage disposal,

29:43.535 --> 29:44.498
but I'll do that tomorrow.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.734
You're too under-the-gun
tonight.

29:45.769 --> 29:47.498
Oh.

29:47.533 --> 29:49.732
Well, thanks.

29:49.767 --> 29:52.667
I really
appreciate it.

29:52.702 --> 29:55.234
You're welcome.

30:05.867 --> 30:07.734
What are you doing?

30:07.769 --> 30:09.799
Well, I...

30:09.834 --> 30:11.334
I fixed the sink.

30:11.369 --> 30:12.433
Hey, babe.

30:12.468 --> 30:13.584
Oh.

30:13.619 --> 30:14.700
Hey!

30:16.400 --> 30:17.634
Hey, I hope that you're hungry.

30:17.669 --> 30:19.368
I made
way too much food.

30:22.234 --> 30:25.500
I can't stay for dinner,
actually.

30:25.535 --> 30:26.800
I've got some stuff to do.

30:26.835 --> 30:27.918
Okay.

30:27.953 --> 30:29.001
Toodles.

30:31.301 --> 30:33.634
Hi.

30:41.667 --> 30:42.800
Oh, my God.

30:42.835 --> 30:43.899
What?

30:43.934 --> 30:45.234
Nothing.
I'm not finished yet.

30:45.269 --> 30:46.467
Go away.

30:48.600 --> 30:50.268
Yeah.

30:51.967 --> 30:53.400
Secret evil plan, one,

30:53.435 --> 30:55.251
Roger, nothing.

30:55.286 --> 30:57.032
Hey, Jimmy,

30:57.067 --> 30:58.268
you got to see this, man.

30:58.303 --> 30:59.134
This is great.

31:00.001 --> 31:02.301
Son of a bitch!

31:06.301 --> 31:07.667
Hey!

31:09.867 --> 31:10.834
Roger, don't do this.

31:13.500 --> 31:15.533
Get the hell off of me!

31:15.568 --> 31:17.132
Hey!

31:17.167 --> 31:18.334
What are you doing?

31:20.500 --> 31:23.334
I know where you live, Murphy,
you son of a bitch!

31:23.369 --> 31:24.299
What are you doing?

31:24.334 --> 31:25.700
Should I
call the cops?

31:25.735 --> 31:26.665
No.

31:26.700 --> 31:27.901
Go back to bed,
Mrs. O'Brian.

31:27.936 --> 31:28.899
Everything's fine.

31:28.934 --> 31:30.667
This is crazy. I'm out of here.

31:30.702 --> 31:31.966
Roger!

31:32.001 --> 31:33.234
Hey, that was the Murphy kid.

31:33.269 --> 31:34.832
Yes, I know. Roger!

31:34.867 --> 31:36.067
He was over in my house...

31:36.102 --> 31:37.451
Roger, don't leave.

31:37.486 --> 31:38.800
while I was
over here.

31:40.034 --> 31:41.465
See you, Rog.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.667
What's eating him?

31:43.702 --> 31:45.799
Don't say anything.

31:45.834 --> 31:47.234
Everything all right
out there?

31:47.269 --> 31:48.665
Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.034
Oh, God,
how I hate this neighborhood.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.101
What do you want me to do
about Colleen?

31:54.136 --> 31:55.266
Just send her home.

31:55.301 --> 31:56.800
Yeah, nice
talking to you too.

32:12.901 --> 32:15.433
Oh.

32:18.234 --> 32:19.667
Pretty powerful
stuff, huh?

32:19.702 --> 32:21.433
Oh, Kenny, it's awful.

32:21.468 --> 32:22.450
I know.

32:22.485 --> 32:23.398
You know,

32:23.433 --> 32:24.834
some of the imagery
I chose

32:24.869 --> 32:26.035
was pretty--

32:26.070 --> 32:27.235
No, the poetry.

32:27.270 --> 32:28.365
It's awful.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.783
It's some of
the worst stuff

32:29.818 --> 32:31.167
I ever read
in my whole life.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.534
No, it can't be.

32:33.569 --> 32:34.665
I-I-I rushed you.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.634
Maybe you should read it again.

32:36.669 --> 32:38.467
Oh, my God, no.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.967
Kenny, you can't show this
to anybody.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.832
Wait a minute.

32:43.867 --> 32:46.133
Now, you listen to me.

32:46.168 --> 32:48.184
This is
how I've learned

32:48.219 --> 32:50.560
how to express myself,

32:50.595 --> 32:53.597
my feelings about work,

32:53.632 --> 32:55.950
the stuff
that goes on,

32:55.985 --> 32:58.268
the things
that I've seen.

33:00.334 --> 33:03.034
I thought you'd be happy.

33:03.069 --> 33:05.734
I'm finally able to...

33:05.769 --> 33:08.365
open up to you, share.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.767
No, Ken, please,
I don't need you to share.

33:12.567 --> 33:13.899
I don't want you
opening up.

33:13.934 --> 33:16.132
I don't want you
coming home from work

33:16.167 --> 33:19.001
and talking about dead babies
and cats and people burning.

33:19.036 --> 33:21.066
Kenny, I like it

33:21.101 --> 33:23.467
when it's just
me and you

33:23.502 --> 33:25.318
and some red wine and cookies

33:25.353 --> 33:27.134
and watching
Mary Tyler Moore

33:27.169 --> 33:29.465
and The Match Game.

33:29.500 --> 33:33.767
I love you the way you are,
okay?

33:33.802 --> 33:35.334
So I'll get rid of these.

33:44.167 --> 33:45.333
...take into account

33:45.368 --> 33:47.001
the amount of room
they're going to have

33:47.036 --> 33:48.234
under the salary cap
next year.

33:48.269 --> 33:49.199
I mean,
I don't think

33:49.234 --> 33:50.534
Richardson is
going to get...

33:50.569 --> 33:52.051
What are you doing with that?

33:52.086 --> 33:53.498
You're missing
a button.

33:53.533 --> 33:55.699
I'm gonna fix it in the morning.

33:55.734 --> 33:59.301
Took it out of the closet
so I wouldn't forget.

33:59.336 --> 34:00.852
You coming up?

34:00.887 --> 34:02.368
Yeah, in a minute.

34:05.567 --> 34:07.334
So where you think
he'll end up?

34:07.369 --> 34:09.065
There's plenty
of teams

34:09.101 --> 34:11.600
that can still use
a veteran player...

34:22.167 --> 34:23.734
Huh.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.233
Come on.

34:49.268 --> 34:50.266
Pick it up here.

34:50.301 --> 34:52.134
We're better
than this.

34:52.168 --> 34:53.299
Goddamn it.

34:53.333 --> 34:54.766
Who's covering him,
huh?

34:54.802 --> 34:56.364
I had my guy.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.498
This is bullshit, Ryan.

34:58.533 --> 35:00.134
You got to put the kid in.
Seriously.

35:00.169 --> 35:01.233
Play some defense.

35:01.268 --> 35:03.722
You're joking. I was playing defense.
Got no speed down there.

35:03.753 --> 35:04.910
We're dying out there.

35:04.945 --> 35:06.032
Let's take a vote, guys.

35:06.067 --> 35:07.467
Who wants to put
the kid in?

35:07.502 --> 35:08.465
I do!

35:08.500 --> 35:09.632
Pretty much unanimous.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.500
You ladies can stick your votes
up your asses.

35:11.535 --> 35:12.732
This isn't
a democracy.

35:12.767 --> 35:14.867
It's a dictatorship,
and I'm Castro.

35:14.902 --> 35:16.567
The kid sits.

35:18.201 --> 35:19.167
Scumbag.

35:24.567 --> 35:26.167
What the--?

35:29.533 --> 35:31.533
How you doing now, Fidel, huh?
How you doing now?

35:35.467 --> 35:36.467
What's up
with those guys?

35:36.502 --> 35:37.334
I don't know.

35:39.767 --> 35:41.368
That's got to be
against the rules, right?

35:41.403 --> 35:42.433
I don't know.

35:44.867 --> 35:47.067
Go get him, John.

35:48.867 --> 35:50.384
Come on,
break it up, Tommy.

35:50.419 --> 35:51.866
Come on, Tommy,
break it up.

35:51.901 --> 35:53.700
If you call Sheila again,
you're a dead man.

35:56.734 --> 35:58.368
Scumbag.

36:14.001 --> 36:15.699
Sheridan Real Estate.
Don Regis speaking.

36:15.734 --> 36:18.634
Yeah, I think you might have
spoken to my wife last week,

36:18.669 --> 36:19.599
Janet Gavin.

36:19.634 --> 36:20.867
Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

36:20.902 --> 36:22.101
About the farmhouse.

36:22.136 --> 36:23.284
Farmhouse?

36:23.319 --> 36:24.398
In San Jose?

36:24.433 --> 36:26.034
No, we're located
in Wichita...

36:26.069 --> 36:27.418
Kansas.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.476
Kansas?

36:29.511 --> 36:31.500
Oh, my God.

36:33.034 --> 36:34.132
Hey!

36:34.167 --> 36:35.368
What's up, man?

36:35.403 --> 36:37.001
You going in?

36:42.001 --> 36:43.400
Take care of yourself,
all right, man?

36:43.435 --> 36:44.400
It was good seeing you.

36:44.435 --> 36:45.467
All right.

36:45.502 --> 36:46.584
Hey, hey!

36:46.619 --> 36:47.667
Oh, it's you.

36:47.702 --> 36:49.299
Yeah.

36:49.334 --> 36:51.217
You got a lot of balls
showing up here.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.101
There are 20 or 30 guys
inside right now

36:53.136 --> 36:54.565
who'd like a piece of your ass.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.700
Well, it is that kind of joint,
isn't it?

36:56.735 --> 36:57.700
Yeah, very funny.

36:57.735 --> 36:58.665
Hey, wait.

36:58.700 --> 36:59.732
It's Vinny, right?

36:59.767 --> 37:02.067
I didn't come here
the other night

37:02.102 --> 37:03.333
looking for a fight.

37:03.368 --> 37:06.667
And I didn't come tonight
looking for one, either.

37:06.702 --> 37:09.901
I came to talk to that Teff guy.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.233
He started the fight.

37:11.268 --> 37:12.433
He threw
the first punch,

37:12.468 --> 37:13.699
you saw him do that.

37:13.734 --> 37:15.734
And I know a couple
of other guys in there

37:15.769 --> 37:17.134
- saw it, too.
- So?

37:17.169 --> 37:20.266
So, uh...

37:20.301 --> 37:22.000
I mean, it's possible I...

37:22.035 --> 37:23.665
I might need a witness,

37:23.700 --> 37:25.834
and I was hoping you'd,
you know,

37:25.869 --> 37:27.099
do the right thing.

37:27.134 --> 37:28.765
You know,
funny thing about gay bashers.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.134
They're all tough guys
until they get caught.

37:32.169 --> 37:33.966
I never--

37:34.001 --> 37:37.567
I saw what every other guy
in the place saw.

37:37.602 --> 37:39.234
You threw the first punch.

37:56.001 --> 37:57.684
Kansas.
What the hell is she thinking?

37:57.719 --> 37:59.368
I mean, of all the places
she could pick.

37:59.403 --> 38:00.734
You've seen The Wizard of Oz.

38:00.769 --> 38:01.899
Kansas sucks.

38:01.934 --> 38:03.665
What does that mean to you,
though?

38:03.700 --> 38:05.150
I mean, you're not
going anywhere, right?

38:05.185 --> 38:06.600
No, I'm not going there.
Forget that.

38:06.635 --> 38:07.565
All right. Good.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.632
I mean, you can't, right?

38:08.667 --> 38:10.498
Why? What are you talking about?

38:10.533 --> 38:12.250
No, I'm just saying
you can't go to Kan--

38:12.285 --> 38:13.932
What would happen to me?
I'm stuck here.

38:13.963 --> 38:15.660
I don't have enough worries
and responsibilities.

38:15.691 --> 38:17.852
I have to worry about
where you're gonna go?

38:17.904 --> 38:20.098
After everything I've done for you?
Are you drunk?

38:20.134 --> 38:21.299
What have you done for me?

38:21.334 --> 38:22.899
I-- What do you mean,
what have I--?

38:22.934 --> 38:25.368
I gotta sit here and listen
to you whine, bitch and moan

38:25.403 --> 38:26.432
about this and that.

38:26.467 --> 38:28.765
I gotta baby-sit your demons.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.034
You know--
You insensitive prick!

38:30.069 --> 38:31.166
You know what?

38:31.201 --> 38:32.900
If things are so rough for you
around here,

38:32.935 --> 38:34.600
why don't you go haunt
somebody else, okay?

38:34.635 --> 38:35.765
Go ahead, huh?

38:35.800 --> 38:37.400
Go to somebody else's house
and hang around,

38:37.435 --> 38:38.398
and you know what?

38:38.433 --> 38:39.599
You can take them with you.

38:39.634 --> 38:41.700
You can take
the little girl with the kitten

38:41.735 --> 38:43.665
and the black kid.
Go get 'em. Screw.

38:43.700 --> 38:46.433
As a matter of fact,
get the hell out now. Get out!

38:46.468 --> 38:47.450
Tommy?

38:47.485 --> 38:48.459
I, uh...

38:48.494 --> 38:49.398
I knocked.

38:49.433 --> 38:50.933
I, uh, guess
you didn't hear.

38:50.968 --> 38:52.398
I thought you got company.

38:52.433 --> 38:53.734
I heard you talking to somebody.

38:53.769 --> 38:54.699
No, no, no.

38:54.734 --> 38:56.767
I was yelling at the...

38:56.802 --> 38:58.284
The game was on.

38:58.319 --> 38:59.726
The cable went out.

38:59.761 --> 39:01.134
You want a drink?

39:01.169 --> 39:02.699
Yeah, sure.

39:02.734 --> 39:04.167
Here you go, pal.

39:04.202 --> 39:05.365
Hey, thanks.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.750
So how you doing?

39:07.785 --> 39:10.101
I'm all right.

39:10.136 --> 39:11.101
Yeah?

39:15.967 --> 39:16.834
What's going on?

39:18.500 --> 39:20.500
Did I ever tell you
about my old man?

39:20.535 --> 39:22.334
The cop.

39:22.369 --> 39:24.099
Yeah.

39:24.134 --> 39:26.732
On the force for 39 years.

39:26.767 --> 39:29.550
I mean, he wasn't like a star
or anything,

39:29.585 --> 39:32.334
but they gave him points
for staying power,

39:32.369 --> 39:33.498
you know what I mean?

39:33.533 --> 39:36.233
Anyway,
he puts his paper in,

39:36.268 --> 39:39.600
and my mother, Edna,
she wanted to travel, you know?

39:39.635 --> 39:41.565
A little golf, maybe.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.934
Maybe get a motor home,
you know,

39:42.969 --> 39:44.268
and travel
around the country,

39:44.303 --> 39:46.099
all that bullshit.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.667
Then three days into it,
he, uh...

39:48.702 --> 39:50.932
He takes his service revolver,

39:50.967 --> 39:52.600
and he tries
to blow his head off.

39:52.635 --> 39:54.251
Holy shit.

39:54.286 --> 39:55.832
Oh, yeah.

39:55.867 --> 39:57.201
He missed, though.

39:57.236 --> 39:58.567
Thank God.

39:58.602 --> 40:00.299
Wow.

40:00.334 --> 40:01.932
Anyway, you know...

40:01.967 --> 40:05.301
we're in the hospital,
just the two of us, huh?

40:05.336 --> 40:07.599
And I said to him,

40:07.634 --> 40:10.967
"You busted your ass
for 39 years.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.850
"I mean, you're finally free,

40:15.885 --> 40:18.101
"and this
is what you do?

40:18.136 --> 40:20.632
What the hell?"

40:20.667 --> 40:22.634
And you know what he says to me?

40:27.201 --> 40:30.167
He said he couldn't live
without his family.

40:30.202 --> 40:31.599
I said,
"What are you talking about?

40:31.634 --> 40:36.067
"We're all right here:
Mom, me, Danny boy."

40:42.600 --> 40:46.001
He meant the guys on the job.

40:50.834 --> 40:53.067
Oh, God, Tommy.

40:55.101 --> 40:57.567
What have I done?

41:02.101 --> 41:04.301
Jesus Christ, what have I done?

41:09.767 --> 41:10.934
All right, pal.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.418
Take it easy.

41:12.453 --> 41:13.832
All right?

41:13.867 --> 41:16.301
Everything
will be fine.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.767
Tough, huh?

41:26.802 --> 41:28.432
Yeah.

41:28.467 --> 41:30.599
Don't worry, cuz.

41:30.634 --> 41:32.134
I'll always be here for you.

42:06.767 --> 42:08.533
Ahhh.
