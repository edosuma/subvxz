Welcome to gymnastics. I am Coach Lugash.

02:00.820 --> 02:05.348

- Eight.
- Eight? Too old! Go home, Grandma!

into a nature preserve...

Whoo! You da man, Carl!
I believe you can fly!

04:15.822 --> 04:20.815

at basketball because I'm African-American!

[Quietly]
All right, Skinner, I want you to block out Carl.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.823
Moe, you can take
Professor Frink.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.828
Homer, you take
Groundskeeper Willie.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.830
No way am I taking
Groundskeeper Willie.

04:59.932 --> 05:02.992
Yes, you are.
Are you a team player or not?

05:04.037 --> 05:06.471
Oh, my goodness,

your anterior cruciate ligament.

- Did you say <i>anterior?</i>
- Yes.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.060
[Screaming]

05:33.166 --> 05:35.157
Now how did this happen?

05:35.268 --> 05:38.726

would refresh my memory.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.802
[Chuckles, Sighs]

05:41.908 --> 05:44.843
I don't know.

Ga! Oh, yeah.

05:47.847 --> 05:52.181
- Now I remember it like it was yesterday.
- It happened today.

Hey, man,
you're harshing my buzz.

05:55.154 --> 05:59.488
Anyway, it all started
when I was-

06:03.629 --> 06:05.529
You go, Homer.

06:13.439 --> 06:15.930
We've got to
get you into surgery.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.034
Maybe a little morphine
would get me there quicker.

06:19.145 --> 06:22.012
- [Sigh]
- [Grunts]

06:24.784 --> 06:27.912
So many times we've seen our father
go under the knife.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.545
One more and I get
a free hysterectomy.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.991
Now, Homer, you'll have a full recovery
from your spinal cord injury.

06:37.096 --> 06:40.896
- What spinal cord injury?
- Oh, he fell off the gurney.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.094
But it will take plenty of time and rehab
before you can go back to work.

06:44.203 --> 06:48.003
Miss work? But my life would be nothing
without the nucleon plant.

06:48.107 --> 06:51.474
Oh, you're also responsible
for this hefty hospital bill.

06:51.577 --> 06:55.035
You shouldn't have ordered all those
hospital haircuts and porno films.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.413
But <i>Doctor Screwlittle</i>
sounded like a delightful romp.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.850

worry about the bill.

Two weeks?
What am I supposed to do?

07:22.775 --> 07:26.643
Just sit on my ass and watch TV?
That ain't my style, man.

07:26.746 --> 07:31.274

No, Homer won't be able to play
for a long time.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.269

07:51.370 --> 07:54.134

Well, I can still hang out with you guys.

07:57.944 --> 08:00.071
Sorry. I got a baseball game
in 15 minutes.

Aw, come on.
There's lots of ways to pass the time.

Uh, Mr. Simpson, you weren't
supposed to leave the home.

08:29.742 --> 08:32.073

08:32.178 --> 08:34.942
Sure, it is.

08:37.049 --> 08:41.850

My babysitter canceled, and I

It's gonna be one wholesome evening.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.469

09:31.571 --> 09:35.029
Well, Marge isn't here.
She had to identify a body at the morgue.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.105
That's not my Uncle Lou.
And this man's not dead.

09:42.214 --> 09:45.775

I'm kinda in a pickle here.

Well, they would
keep me company.

- Sure. Knock yourselves out. And call me Homer.
- [Boys Gasp]

10:10.610 --> 10:14.137
Daddy said it's rude to call
grown-ups by their first name.

10:14.246 --> 10:18.444
Daddy's not here, is he?
[Laughs]

10:21.854 --> 10:24.914
Now my good man,
what do you like to play?

10:25.024 --> 10:28.050
- Pokémon!
- Pokémon? Pokémon?

10:28.160 --> 10:32.995

10:40.606 --> 10:42.506
So did you boys
have a good time?

10:42.608 --> 10:45.133
Yeah. Mr. Simpson
was really funny.

10:45.244 --> 10:48.680
He told us how the world
keeps screwing him over.

10:48.781 --> 10:51.409
[Laughs]
Yeah. Well, how was the concert?

10:51.517 --> 10:55.578
Well, sir, I've never heard a preacher
use the M-F word so many times.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.588
Anyway, thanks again.

Hey, it was fun.
My kids are sick of all my stories.

Oh, Roddy, he's not running a day care center.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.300
Don't tell me
what I'm not doing.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.099
So you are running
a day care center?

11:13.205 --> 11:15.070
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

11:15.174 --> 11:18.803
Oh, I sure would. It would
give the boys a place to go after school.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.846
Then I'll do it,
just to see the look on your face.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.277

Why, Homer, your surgical incision

12:12.598 --> 12:16.762
I owe it all to my rewarding work with children.
And not picking at it.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.962
Ah, yes, how is your
day care center doing?

12:19.071 --> 12:23.701
Wonderful! Being with those kids

- [Chuckles] Peek... a... boo!
- [Whines]

12:46.265 --> 12:49.132
Uncle Homer, will you sing
that crazy song we love?

12:49.235 --> 12:51.635
[Chuckles]
Okay.

12:51.737 --> 12:54.865
# Is that all there is #

12:54.974 --> 12:58.466
# Is that all there is #

12:58.577 --> 13:02.411
# If that's all there is
my friend #

13:02.515 --> 13:05.951
#Then let's keep dancing ##

13:06.051 --> 13:10.818
- [Laugh]
- I can't remember the last time
Dad sang us a torch song.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.357
Yeah! Homer, I thought you were only
gonna do this day care thing...

13:13.459 --> 13:15.359
till your knee was better.

13:15.461 --> 13:19.488
Yes. But then I discovered
the joys of raising children.

13:19.598 --> 13:22.396
- What about us?
- Don't worry, honey.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.833
You'll have children
of your own someday.

13:24.937 --> 13:27.030
Then you'll know my joy.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.709
Hey, Bart, your dad gave me
this temp tattoo.

13:34.814 --> 13:39.945
It's so cool.
[Imitating Motorcycle]

13:41.287 --> 13:43.755
You have the "bestest" dad.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.154
He read me
a story about Chinese food.

13:46.258 --> 13:49.819
You haven't seen the real Homer.
It's all burping and neglect.

13:49.929 --> 13:53.421
I think we know your dad
a little bit better than you do, Bart.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.432
Is that my jacket?

13:55.534 --> 13:59.163
- He said it looked better on me!
- [Groans]

14:00.773 --> 14:03.241
# If you're happy
and you know it, say a swear #

14:03.342 --> 14:05.902
- Boobs!
- Heinie!
- Mitten!

14:06.011 --> 14:09.378
[All Laugh]

14:09.481 --> 14:13.110
They're always laughing.
Laughing at nothing.

14:13.219 --> 14:16.313
How come parents are always nicer
to other kids than they are to their own?

14:16.422 --> 14:18.754
I guess Dad just
takes us for granted.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.758
Well, don't worry.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.556
This'll give his heartstrings
a much-needed plucking.

14:26.565 --> 14:30.228
[Laughs]
Huh?

14:31.670 --> 14:34.366
Aw, what a beautiful frame.

14:34.473 --> 14:37.067
Perfect for my day care permit.

14:37.176 --> 14:40.737
Sweet. Mm-hmm.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.746
[Both Groan]

14:44.950 --> 14:46.850
Hang on, everybody!

14:46.952 --> 14:50.388
Three... two... one, blast off!

14:50.489 --> 14:53.356
[Laughing]

14:53.459 --> 14:57.361
That was "tree-mendous!"
[Chuckles] Where's Ralph?

14:57.463 --> 14:59.488
I almost died!

15:01.433 --> 15:03.560
Homer, this man
is from the Good Guy Awards.

15:03.669 --> 15:06.001
We honor people who make
life better for the community.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.005
Like you with your
day care center.

15:08.107 --> 15:12.237
- I contributed by not objecting too much.
- Aw, that's my girl.

15:12.344 --> 15:16.610
Anyway, this film crew will shoot some
behind-the-scenes footage of your amazing work.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.649
- Is there a snack table?
- It's already set up.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.686
[Giggles, Chomping]

15:21.787 --> 15:22.811
Don't film this!

15:27.826 --> 15:30.317
Uh, excuse me.
This is a hot set. No visitors.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.024
- It's my room.
- Well, if you want, you can sit on this.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.101
[Grumbling]

15:36.201 --> 15:39.193
- Teamsters are sleeping in my room.
- <i>We'rejust resting our eyes.</i>

15:39.305 --> 15:42.206
'Cause the thing is
there are no bad kids.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.435
Ow! You stepped on my arm!

15:44.543 --> 15:47.307
Sorry. Daddy thought
you were a pile of cable.

15:47.413 --> 15:49.472
Tell me about
the Homer Cares Program.

15:49.581 --> 15:53.449
My kids wear these hearts
to remind them they are always loved.

15:53.552 --> 15:56.077
Aww. Did you make 'em yourself?

15:56.188 --> 15:58.816
Yes. Through the magic of caring.

15:58.924 --> 16:02.985
- Night will come soon.
- There's gotta be a way to get back at Dad.

16:03.095 --> 16:06.792
Well, I've been cutting
the felt kind of crooked.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.925
No. We've gotta show the world
what Dad's really like.

16:10.035 --> 16:13.004
Then everything
will be back to normal.

16:13.105 --> 16:16.871
[Evil Laugh]
Back to normal.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.443
[Evil Laugh Continues]

16:24.049 --> 16:27.075
# I'm a nice guy
I'm a hell of a guy #

16:27.186 --> 16:29.518
#And tonight we honor you ##

16:29.621 --> 16:31.646
Stop the music!
Stop it!

16:31.757 --> 16:34.157
One more line,
and we have to pay for the song!

16:34.259 --> 16:38.696
- Now, is anyone here from Springfield?
- You know we are!

16:38.797 --> 16:42.563
Oh, tough crowd.
[Laughs]

16:42.668 --> 16:44.568
So what's in the news?

16:44.670 --> 16:49.403
Oh, right.
The bus disaster-very sad.

16:49.508 --> 16:53.000
Now our first award
is for biggest people pleaser.

16:53.112 --> 16:56.639
You can walk all over these doormats.

17:09.228 --> 17:13.164

17:13.265 --> 17:18.202
[Laughs] Now I'm told
there's a glitch in our Internet webcast.

17:18.303 --> 17:24.242
So all of you out there, type " control
backslash semicolon alt dot escape"...

17:24.343 --> 17:28.575
- and you'll be fine.
- [Grunts] Ah, perfect.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.979
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

17:32.084 --> 17:36.111

- <i>If you can find a sturdier hypno-coin, you buy it.</i>
- <i>[Applause]</i>

17:40.426 --> 17:45.830
Now, every year we find one Good Samaritan
so deserving that not recognizing him...

17:45.931 --> 17:49.492
would make Santa Claus himself
vomit with rage.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.933
[Groans]
Who writes this stuff?

17:52.037 --> 17:56.736
[Chimp Chitters, Growls]

17:58.510 --> 18:01.809
This year's winner ofThe Saint

<i>[Krusty]</i>
<i>Homer Simpson!</i>

18:07.486 --> 18:09.386
- Yes!
- [Cheering, Applause]

18:09.488 --> 18:12.787
All my love has come back
in trophy form.

18:12.891 --> 18:16.554
Now let's take a look
at Homer's wonderful work.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.994
[Man Narrating]
It looks like any other home in America.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.396
<i>But this is the house</i>
<i>that love built.</i>

18:21.500 --> 18:23.400

<i>His scabby red knee became</i>
<i>an infectious beacon ofhope.</i>

18:37.182 --> 18:38.547
Aww.

18:40.419 --> 18:43.582
<i>I guess you could sum up Homer</i>
<i>in two words:</i>

18:43.689 --> 18:45.748
- <i>[Bart] Big phony!</i>
- [Gasp]

18:45.858 --> 18:47.883
This is the real Homer Simpson-

18:47.993 --> 18:50.359
- <i>A beer-drinking meanie!</i>
- [Sniffs]

18:50.462 --> 18:53.761
- [Groans]
- Huh?

18:53.866 --> 18:56.960

- [Laughs]

18:58.203 --> 19:00.171
- I'll call.
- Three nines.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.740
Oh! I almost had a straight!

19:02.841 --> 19:04.741
Come to new papa.

19:04.843 --> 19:07.607
- [Gasping, Murmuring]
- Hey, what's the deal?

19:07.713 --> 19:11.376
We just spliced in some home movies.
What do you think?

19:11.483 --> 19:15.419
Well, I'd rather reserve judgment until l-
Oh, my God!

19:15.521 --> 19:18.456
- I'll mace you good!
- [Screams]

19:18.557 --> 19:22.152
- [Gasps]
- That is completely taken out of context!

19:22.261 --> 19:26.891
Why you little-
[Screaming]

19:26.999 --> 19:29.661
Our children aren't safe
with that monster!

19:29.768 --> 19:31.998
Yeah, keep away from him,
Milhouse!

19:32.104 --> 19:34.572
<i>You too, Ralphie.</i>
<i>You're out of that day care center.</i>

19:34.673 --> 19:37.938
Oh! My polite indignation
knows no bounds!

19:38.043 --> 19:40.273
[Grunts]
No! No!

19:40.379 --> 19:42.904
No one is taking
my kids from me!

Come back here with my young'un!

19:50.455 --> 19:54.323

all too often these days.

20:24.523 --> 20:26.889
Arnie, please leave this
to the police.

20:26.992 --> 20:29.688
I'm sick of being a reporter.
I want to make the news!

20:29.795 --> 20:33.891
- Arnie, this is not the time!
- You're not the time, Kent! You're not the time!

20:35.467 --> 20:37.492
Where are we going,
Mr. Simpson?

20:37.603 --> 20:42.165
- I'll tell you where we're not going. Jail!

21:14.506 --> 21:16.770
All right, Fatty.
Out of the pipe!

21:18.877 --> 21:20.902
Why did you rat me out, kids?

21:21.013 --> 21:24.881
Was it because I showered love
on those other children while ignoring you?

21:24.983 --> 21:26.348
- Yep.
- Pretty much.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.043
Well, I learned my lesson.

From now on, you two are the only kids
I'll care about. Oh, and Maggie.
