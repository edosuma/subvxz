<i>It's 9:45 p.m.,
December 3, 1926.</i>

01:16.871 --> 01:20.463
<i>Famed mystery writer
Agatha Christie.</i>

01:20.540 --> 01:21.727
<i>She's kind of like the</i>

01:21.804 --> 01:24.560
Stephen King of the 1920s.

01:24.709 --> 01:28.239
<i>Packed a small suitcase,
walks out of her house,</i>

01:28.496 --> 01:31.244
<i>and she disappears.</i>

01:31.321 --> 01:33.818
<i>♪ Dun, dun, dun ♪</i>

01:33.895 --> 01:34.984
<i>Mystery.</i>

01:35.061 --> 01:36.150
Um...

01:36.227 --> 01:39.057
<i>So the next day, a gypsy
boy named George Bess</i>

01:39.134 --> 01:42.204
<i>is walking along, and then he
comes to the bottom of a hill,</i>

01:42.281 --> 01:43.736
<i>and he's like, whoa!</i>

01:43.813 --> 01:45.077
<i>What's this car doing here?</i>

01:45.154 --> 01:47.250
<i>Cars don't... aren't
at the bottom of hills.</i>

01:47.327 --> 01:48.930
<i>And the car has the hood popped,</i>

01:49.007 --> 01:50.836
<i>and a door is open,
and lights are on,</i>

01:50.913 --> 01:52.236
<i>so he calls the police.</i>

01:52.313 --> 01:54.215
<i>The police come, and
Deputy Chief Constable</i>

01:54.292 --> 01:56.391
<i>William Kenward was like,
you know what?</i>

01:56.468 --> 02:00.489
<i>I'm on the case, and I'm gonna
search the shit out of this.</i>

02:01.301 --> 02:04.219
<i>And he looks inside, and
there's an expired license</i>

02:04.296 --> 02:06.616
<i>and a piece of paper, and they say,</i>

02:06.693 --> 02:10.130
<i>Agatha... Christie.</i>

02:11.718 --> 02:13.528
<i>It's called vocal fry.</i>

02:26.563 --> 02:29.285
<i>So he's like,
oh, my God.</i>

02:29.479 --> 02:33.649
<i>There's been a mystery with
our own mystery writer.</i>

02:33.726 --> 02:35.807
So then,
William Kenward is like,

02:35.884 --> 02:37.130
<i>I'm gonna get scouts.</i>

02:37.207 --> 02:39.375
<i>I'm gonna get bloodhounds.
I'm gonna get divers.</i>

02:39.452 --> 02:40.493
<i>I'm gonna get planes.</i>

02:40.570 --> 02:42.391
<i>We've never used planes
before to search for someone,</i>

02:42.468 --> 02:43.602
<i>but, you know what,
I'm gonna **** do it.</i>

02:43.679 --> 02:46.435
- Wow.
- They **** were searching

02:46.524 --> 02:48.420
like, to the max.

02:48.497 --> 02:49.916
<i>But no dice.</i>

02:49.993 --> 02:51.674
<i>They don't find her.
Shit.</i>

02:51.751 --> 02:53.233
So Kenward's like, okay.

02:53.310 --> 02:55.597
<i>What I'm gonna do is, we're
in the middle of a mystery...</i>

02:55.674 --> 03:00.109
<i>I'm gonna get two mystery
writers to help find her.</i>

03:00.186 --> 03:02.716
<i>So he employs the help of
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,</i>

03:02.793 --> 03:04.487
<i>AKA the writer of "Sherlock Holmes,"</i>

03:04.564 --> 03:07.033
<i>and then this lady Dorothy
L. Sayers, who we don't know.</i>

03:07.110 --> 03:09.090
<i>But then somebody comes in like, ooh!</i>

03:09.167 --> 03:10.201
<i>Record scratch.</i>

03:10.278 --> 03:11.227
<i>Oh, what?</i>

03:11.304 --> 03:13.126
<i>Don't worry about it.
We found Agatha.</i>

03:14.545 --> 03:17.053
<i>So 11 days after she disappeared,</i>

03:17.130 --> 03:18.461
<i>people are waiting, being like,</i>

03:18.538 --> 03:20.705
<i>what happened to famed mystery
writer Agatha Christie?</i>

03:20.782 --> 03:22.041
<i>Where did she go?</i>

03:22.118 --> 03:23.262
<i>And she's like, I don't know.</i>

03:23.339 --> 03:24.736
<i>I can't... I can't help you.</i>

03:24.813 --> 03:26.787
<i>The police are like, what?</i>

03:26.864 --> 03:29.075
<i>Really disappointing.
We were all searching for her,</i>

03:29.152 --> 03:30.428
<i>but she's just here?</i>

03:30.505 --> 03:33.748
<i>So the police were left to
just like piece together</i>

03:33.825 --> 03:35.594
<i>what had happened over those 11 days.</i>

03:35.671 --> 03:36.865
<i>So flashback.</i>

03:36.942 --> 03:40.098
<i>Okay, at the time, December 3, 1926,</i>

03:40.175 --> 03:43.236
<i>um, Agatha is having a tough time.</i>

03:43.313 --> 03:44.936
<i>Okay? She's 36.</i>

03:45.013 --> 03:48.472
And... life is punching
her in the tits, okay?

03:48.549 --> 03:50.382
<i>Like, her marriage is on the rocks,</i>

03:50.459 --> 03:52.957
<i>and her husband Archie
is being a dick about it.</i>

03:53.034 --> 03:55.728
<i>He was like, I want
to marry my secretary,</i>

03:55.805 --> 03:57.282
<i>but I'm already married.</i>

03:57.838 --> 04:00.634
<i>This **** wife of mine.</i>

04:00.740 --> 04:03.802
<i>So she starts to exhibit the
signs of a nervous breakdown.</i>

04:03.879 --> 04:06.365
<i>And Archie's like, hey,
I'm gonna leave you.</i>

04:06.442 --> 04:07.902
<i>I'm gonna leave you
for my secretary</i>

04:07.979 --> 04:09.285
<i>because I like her
better than you.</i>

04:09.362 --> 04:10.826
<i>And she's like,
wow!</i>

04:10.903 --> 04:12.468
<i>Really cool.</i>

04:12.545 --> 04:14.582
<i>She was like, you know what?
I'm gonna go to...</i>

04:14.659 --> 04:15.974
<i>I'm gonna leave.</i>

04:16.051 --> 04:17.435
<i>I'm gonna drive to London.</i>

04:17.512 --> 04:19.072
<i>So she starts driving to London...</i>

04:19.149 --> 04:21.156
<i>Bash! Bam!</i>

04:21.233 --> 04:23.369
<i>Car accident.
She gets into a car accident.</i>

04:23.446 --> 04:26.042
<i>So 24 hours later,</i>

04:26.119 --> 04:29.751
<i>very mysteriously,
she arrives at this spa</i>

04:29.828 --> 04:32.427
<i>and hotel called
the Swan Hydropathic</i>

04:32.504 --> 04:33.563
<i>in Harrogate,</i>

04:33.640 --> 04:36.335
230 miles from
where she had been.

04:36.412 --> 04:37.471
<i>She checks in.</i>

04:37.548 --> 04:39.317
<i>And she's like, hey, look at me.</i>

04:39.394 --> 04:40.442
<i>I'm wearing glasses.</i>

04:40.519 --> 04:41.871
<i>I wasn't wearing glasses before,</i>

04:41.948 --> 04:43.422
<i>and I've got a different hairstyle.</i>

04:43.499 --> 04:44.626
<i>What?</i>

04:44.703 --> 04:46.404
Did she stage her
own disappearance?

04:46.481 --> 04:49.008
Or did she have a mental break?

04:49.085 --> 04:50.257
- Whoa.
- Right?

04:50.334 --> 04:52.795
And she's like
<i>my name is Teresa Neele.</i>

04:52.872 --> 04:54.621
<i>I'm from Capetown, South Africa.</i>

04:54.698 --> 04:56.248
<i>I've just lost a child.</i>

04:56.325 --> 04:57.658
<i>Please lay off my back.</i>

04:57.735 --> 04:59.332
<i>I'm trying to recuperate.</i>

04:59.409 --> 05:02.275
<i>Um, that's all there is to it.</i>

05:03.170 --> 05:05.897
<i>And the hotel people are like,
okay, too much information.</i>

05:05.974 --> 05:07.135
<i>And then she's like,
you know what?</i>

05:07.212 --> 05:08.379
<i>I'm gonna have a great time.</i>

05:08.456 --> 05:11.386
<i>I'm gonna like, live it up.</i>

05:12.177 --> 05:14.609
<i>She gets some beauty treatments.</i>

05:14.686 --> 05:15.879
<i>She goes dancing.</i>

05:15.956 --> 05:17.533
<i>Chilling out, maxin', and relaxing.</i>

05:17.610 --> 05:18.704
<i>All cool.</i>

05:19.084 --> 05:21.458
<i>And she's reading her own story.</i>

05:21.535 --> 05:22.628
<i>Like, ooh.</i>

05:22.705 --> 05:24.157
<i>What's going on in the news?</i>

05:24.234 --> 05:25.200
<i>This is interesting.</i>

05:25.277 --> 05:26.376
<i>The weather's gonna be 78,</i>

05:26.453 --> 05:28.305
<i>and there's lady missing
named Agatha...</i>

05:28.382 --> 05:30.124
<i>Christie.</i>

05:31.400 --> 05:32.523
So...

05:32.600 --> 05:34.592
Be careful with that drink.

05:34.678 --> 05:37.133
It's fine, Derek!

05:39.022 --> 05:40.206
So...

05:40.307 --> 05:42.338
<i>Meanwhile, a chambermaid is like,</i>

05:42.415 --> 05:44.608
<i>wait, um, aren't you her?</i>

05:44.685 --> 05:46.077
<i>Aren't you this person?</i>

05:46.154 --> 05:48.761
<i>And she's just like, I don't
know what you're saying.</i>

05:48.838 --> 05:51.001
- <i>So the police...</i>
- This is really bothering me.

05:51.078 --> 05:52.731
- I'm so afraid...
- No, no, no.

05:52.808 --> 05:54.219
That's gonna fall.

05:54.296 --> 05:55.719
Okay, so...

05:55.796 --> 05:57.081
So.

06:00.513 --> 06:01.956
I got it.

06:02.775 --> 06:04.206
So.

06:04.431 --> 06:05.599
So.

06:05.808 --> 06:07.274
The police didn't know
what to make of it.

06:07.351 --> 06:09.703
<i>They were like, this
is a publicity stunt</i>

06:09.780 --> 06:12.912
<i>for her new book, 
"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd."</i>

06:13.115 --> 06:14.548
<i>And some of them are like,</i>

06:14.625 --> 06:17.057
<i>this is her trying to
get back at her husband.</i>

06:17.134 --> 06:18.566
<i>And others are like,</i>

06:18.643 --> 06:21.943
<i>she was in a car crash,
so she had amnesia.</i>

06:22.242 --> 06:23.612
<i>But so Agatha's like,</i>

06:23.689 --> 06:24.954
<i>I don't know. You know what?</i>

06:25.031 --> 06:27.104
<i>But what I do know is
I have a new attitude.</i>

06:27.181 --> 06:28.548
<i>I'm gonna divorce my husband</i>

06:28.625 --> 06:30.522
<i>and I'm gonna go on
to write 80 novels,</i>

06:30.599 --> 06:32.360
<i>and 66 are gonna be mystery novels.</i>

06:32.437 --> 06:36.104
<i>And I'm gonna be such
a best-selling author</i>

06:36.181 --> 06:38.902
<i>that the only person
who beats me... or...</i>

06:38.979 --> 06:40.626
<i>literature that beats me is the Bible.</i>

06:40.703 --> 06:42.298
<i>And...
Shakespeare.</i>

06:42.375 --> 06:43.782
And that is exactly what she did.

06:43.859 --> 06:45.870
<i>She was the huge success.</i>

06:45.947 --> 06:48.609
<i>She never speaks of the event again.</i>

06:48.686 --> 06:50.410
<i>Oh, P.S., I forgot to say,</i>

06:50.487 --> 06:53.024
that at one point,
Agatha said to her sister,

06:53.101 --> 06:55.958
<i>I can disappear at any
point if I wanted to.</i>

06:56.035 --> 06:57.239

06:59.554 --> 07:03.175
<i>So if I disappear,</i>

07:03.260 --> 07:05.318
<i>maybe I know how to do it.</i>

07:08.952 --> 07:10.246
<i>Okay, great.</i>

07:10.323 --> 07:12.858

11:38.434 --> 11:40.121
The guy's name is Dan Cooper.

<i>But thus started the
legend of D.B. Cooper.</i>

11:45.126 --> 11:48.669
And the FBI was able
to dwindle the suspects

11:48.746 --> 11:49.904

18:46.849 --> 18:51.037
<i>Comes to Circleville, Ohio,
to do a story on the letters</i>

18:51.114 --> 18:53.764
<i>and the possible murder and
what the **** is happening.</i>

18:53.841 --> 18:56.547
<i>Everyone's like, we couldn't
believe this happened here.</i>

18:56.624 --> 19:00.730
<i>And then "Unsolved
Mysteries" got a letter from</i>

19:00.984 --> 19:02.977
<i>the Circleville Letter Writer.</i>

19:03.054 --> 19:05.872
<i>And it said forget Circleville.</i>

19:05.949 --> 19:07.675
<i>If you guys come to Circleville,</i>

19:07.752 --> 19:10.972
<i>you... you freakos will pay.</i>

19:11.049 --> 19:12.519
<i>- Wow.
- I know.</i>

19:12.915 --> 19:14.786
I think we should solve this mystery.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.394
All right, so

19:16.521 --> 19:17.923
uh... mm...

19:18.000 --> 19:19.053
What do you think?

19:19.130 --> 19:21.254
You know who talks?

19:21.331 --> 19:22.439
Kids.

19:22.672 --> 19:24.522
You know who listens to kids?

19:24.599 --> 19:25.561
Nobody.

19:25.638 --> 19:26.934
A bus driver.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.454
<i>So what does...
what does that mean?</i>

19:29.545 --> 19:32.564
<i>My theory is that
she would be the perfect person</i>

19:32.641 --> 19:35.800
<i>to know what was going on
in other people's lives.</i>

19:35.877 --> 19:37.866
<i>Because she was hearing
the kids talk</i>

19:37.943 --> 19:39.235
<i>about their parents.</i>

19:39.312 --> 19:41.149
- Oh, my God. You're smart.
- Right?

19:41.226 --> 19:45.073
<i>So Ron Gillespie could
have been suspicious</i>

19:45.227 --> 19:47.021
that Mary is having an affair.

19:47.098 --> 19:48.165
Are you cheating on me?

19:48.242 --> 19:50.359
No, I love you
with my whole heart.

19:50.436 --> 19:52.342
What are... what are these?
Who wrote these?

19:52.419 --> 19:54.214
Please, you're not making
any sense.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.507
You're being hysterical.

19:55.584 --> 19:59.326
<i>And then maybe
she steals the gun</i>

19:59.403 --> 20:01.563
from her **** brother-in-law.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.921
<i>And set up the booby trap.</i>

20:02.998 --> 20:03.997
<i>Exactly.</i>

20:04.074 --> 20:05.202
School bus driver?

20:05.279 --> 20:08.572
More like
I dropped out of school

20:08.649 --> 20:13.035
to become the greatest
criminal of the kind.

20:15.082 --> 20:18.196
<i>And then Paul went to
prison having no idea.</i>

20:18.273 --> 20:20.012
<i>I totally buy this.</i>

20:21.579 --> 20:22.704
Cheers, Georgia.

20:22.781 --> 20:24.223
Let's solve every murder.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.314
To us.

20:25.435 --> 20:26.501
To us.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.238
The night is young, and so are we.

20:28.673 --> 20:29.931
I'm not.

20:30.184 --> 20:31.647
- Yes, you are.
- I am.

20:31.724 --> 20:33.149
22?

20:33.226 --> 20:34.524
Mm-hmm.
