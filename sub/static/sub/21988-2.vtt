WEBVTT

00:03.571 --> 00:05.439
(forklift beeping)

00:05.473 --> 00:07.075
All right,

00:07.108 --> 00:09.243
three down,
three to go.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.649
This doesn't seem right.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.585
Are you still bellyaching?
I chose this career

00:17.618 --> 00:20.254
to help good people
transition peacefully

00:20.288 --> 00:21.555
into the hereafter.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.091
It was this
or brain surgeon, huh?

00:23.124 --> 00:24.258
And here we are

00:24.292 --> 00:25.393
moving dead folks around

00:25.426 --> 00:27.128
like checkers on a board.

00:27.161 --> 00:30.098
All to make room for another
damn lane on the interstate.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.832
At least traffic's
one less thing you'll have

00:31.865 --> 00:34.168
to complain about.
I'll think of
something else.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.472
All right.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.175
Nice and easy.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.210
Careful, Phil.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.277
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:43.311 --> 00:45.279
Watch it!
Damn it.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.682
(shouts)

01:01.195 --> 01:04.098
What in the hell...

01:14.242 --> 01:16.244
*

01:44.805 --> 01:46.907
Your numbers are good, Gibbs,
despite the weight loss.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.310
Nothing a few weeks
of fireplace T-bones

01:49.343 --> 01:51.812
won't put back on you.
Got a head start on that, Doc.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.148
Uh-huh. I figured as much
from your red count.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.584
But all in all, I'd say

01:56.617 --> 01:58.286
you're good to go
for full duty.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.753
Not so fast, Dr. Nuali.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.390
That is, once
Dr. Confalone has added

02:02.423 --> 02:04.392
her seal of approval.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.460
Hey.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.795
How are you?
Good, boss.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.897
Passed with flying colors.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.199
Got a clean bill of health.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.700
Yeah, go figure, huh, Tim?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.302
As I was just saying
to Agent McGee...

02:14.335 --> 02:17.471
Paraguay. Really?

02:17.505 --> 02:18.639
We go where we're needed.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.740
Exactly what I said.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.908
Yeah, which is
doubly great

02:20.941 --> 02:22.310
since Director Vance needs

02:22.343 --> 02:24.212
mandatory psych evaluations

02:24.245 --> 02:25.346
from each of you.

02:25.379 --> 02:28.349
I assume you would prefer
sooner rather than later.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.251
Uh, tell you what
I'd prefer.
A root canal, I know.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.220
What say you we skip
our usual dance?

02:32.253 --> 02:33.821
I was gonna say this afternoon.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.923
Oh.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.659
Great.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.328
Um...
(phone beeps)

02:40.361 --> 02:42.563
want to do 3:00?

02:42.596 --> 02:43.764
I'll be there.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.534
Okay. Um...

02:46.567 --> 02:49.403
Agent McGee, I can get you
right after Gibbs.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.905
(phone ringing)
Oh.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.608
Sorry. One second.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.244
(Grace laughs)

02:56.277 --> 02:58.746
I have to say,
you seem, I don't know,

02:58.779 --> 03:01.482
sunnier than I expected.
Sunnier?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.751
You had a lot of
people praying for you.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.953
You know that.
Well...

03:05.986 --> 03:08.589
I guess it worked.
Don't be glib.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.991
We were worried sick
we might never see you again.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.526
It's good to be seen.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.396
Never mind.
Cloudy as ever.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.398
Bishop wants to know
if we're available.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.967
Says they've got something,
uh, weird, apparently.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.705
Oh, so it's up to me, now?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.006
It is up to you.

03:26.039 --> 03:31.011
Well, I suppose a return
to normalcy wouldn't hurt.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.714
Perhaps a temporary
exception could be made.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.449
Okay, Bishop...
On the condition

03:35.483 --> 03:37.485
that you both keep
your appointments.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.820
No one blows me off
today, understand?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.255
Understood.
And,

03:41.289 --> 03:42.690
you can't be boss,
either, Gibbs.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.259
No supervisor role until
we've had our little chat.

03:45.293 --> 03:48.262
All right, Bishop, you're boss.
We're on our way.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.965
WOMAN (over P.A.): Attention,
Michael, to Admitting.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.234
(elevator bell dings,
door opens)

03:55.068 --> 03:56.870
(bird caws)

03:56.904 --> 03:59.006
(siren wails)
TORRES: Oh, that's nasty.

03:59.039 --> 04:02.443
Yeah, two bodies,
twice the smell.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.611
Yeah, and twice
the nasty.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.279
The way they're
cuddled up like that.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.780
I was gonna go with "stacked,"

04:06.814 --> 04:08.416
but now that you said "cuddle,"

04:08.449 --> 04:09.650
I can't really un-see that.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.320
Thank you.
You're welcome.

04:13.621 --> 04:14.788
And welcome back.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.290
JIMMY:
Yeah, the conquering heroes.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.058
DUCKY:
Just try keeping them away.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.393
Good to be back.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.561
Back where you belong.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.595
In a cemetery?

04:21.629 --> 04:23.431
No, not a cemetery...

04:23.464 --> 04:25.899
I'm sorry, did Gibbs just
try to make a joke?

04:25.933 --> 04:28.001
We are all very happy
that you found your jacket.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.670
Fits better than
I thought it would.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.805
Where do you want us, Bishop?

04:31.839 --> 04:34.308
Oh, no, no, no, that's...
that's okay, Gibbs.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.743
You can, you can take the lead.
GIBBS: No.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.311
No, I can't.
No, still you, Ellie.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.779
You know, Bishop
did a fine job

04:38.812 --> 04:39.813
filling in for you, Gibbs.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.349
I had my doubts,
but, you know,

04:41.382 --> 04:42.483
she actually
surprised me.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.652
Hmm, I surprised you?

04:44.685 --> 04:46.687
Well, not surprised, but...
You had your doubts.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.489
Yeah, well, I mean,
experience alone.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.691
I-I risked my life as an
undercover agent for years

04:50.724 --> 04:53.361
while you were still
crunching numbers at NSA,

04:53.394 --> 04:54.795
that's what I'm saying.
Mm, that's right.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.930
Because my time in Afghanistan,
I mean, that was, like...

04:56.964 --> 04:58.599
that was like spring break.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.833
Ellie.

04:59.867 --> 05:00.868
Where do you want us?

05:00.901 --> 05:03.070
(sighs)
Uh, you two stick with me.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.406
Torres, go talk
to the groundskeepers.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.408
Oh, is that how
we're playing now?

05:07.441 --> 05:08.409
You surprised?

05:08.442 --> 05:10.544
Wow.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.346
Wow...

05:12.380 --> 05:13.714
Amazing how
nothing's changed.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.583
Oh, it's changed plenty.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.951
It'll be so nice to finally
get back to normal.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.953
Whatever that is.
Who's our victim?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.523
Dog tags I.D. him as
Richard Coyne,

05:22.556 --> 05:24.925
a Navy lieutenant
reported U.A.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.927
from Joint Base
Anacostia-Bolling

05:26.960 --> 05:28.929
a year and a half ago.
Who's the woman?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.864
BISHOP: That would be
the casket's rightful owner,

05:30.898 --> 05:32.933
Edna Stone, 87.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.803
She died two years ago,
according to her headstone.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.471
How the hell did
he get in there?

05:37.505 --> 05:39.407
PHIL: I have no idea
how he got in here.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.643
The funeral homes bring us
sealed caskets, and we bury 'em.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.612
There's no one
with access in between.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.779
Y'all remember
burying that one?

05:45.813 --> 05:47.114
Yeah, right.
You remember what

05:47.147 --> 05:48.749
you had for lunch
last Thursday?

05:48.782 --> 05:49.917
Meatball hero.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.985
Dang, maybe you should
work here.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.454
Look, the thing is,

05:53.487 --> 05:55.122
we maintain every inch
of this place.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.491
And I know for a fact there's
been no unauthorized digging.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.759
Not on our watch.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.993
Some stupid digging, maybe.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.062
Stupid how?

06:02.095 --> 06:04.565
Moving bodies is bad juju, man.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.535
You mess with the dead,
they mess with you.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.069
Like Poltergeist.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.505
Can't be good
for anyone's karma.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.709
DUCKY: The old
"two bodies in one casket."

06:15.743 --> 06:17.578
(chuckles)

06:17.611 --> 06:20.481
Yeah, conjures up
a wave of nostalgia.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.682
JIMMY:
You've seen this before?

06:21.715 --> 06:22.983
DUCKY:
Oh, quite a few times.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.752
Yeah, it was
a common means

06:24.785 --> 06:28.822
of hiding dead gang rivals
in London back in the '70s.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.424
Now...

06:30.458 --> 06:31.725
(bagpipe ringtone playing)

06:31.759 --> 06:34.728
Oh, leave me alone, will you?

06:34.762 --> 06:37.565
Cause of death?
It's hard to say.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.533
There is a pretty deep
blunt force trauma

06:39.567 --> 06:40.400
right over here.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.503
Ooh, I could never work
at a cemetery.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.905
Too boring for you?
No, man, not boring enough.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.540
You know, all these
weird vibes.

06:46.574 --> 06:50.043
You mess with the dead,
they mess with you.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.479
Seriously?
Dead serious, man.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.080
My-my grandmother
used to believe

06:53.113 --> 06:54.848
in all that spooky stuff,

06:54.882 --> 06:57.017
so superstitions are
in my DNA.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.619
Nothing boring about that.

06:58.652 --> 06:59.953
Well, I'm with Ducky.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.623
This has "mob hit" written
all over it.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.191
And we've all seen
enough mob movies to know

07:04.224 --> 07:05.926
it's easier to dump a body
in the woods

07:05.959 --> 07:07.828
than it is to dig up
an existing grave.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.030
Yeah, except bodies in the woods
usually get found.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.665
Somebody didn't want us
to find this one.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.689
You okay?

07:37.024 --> 07:39.693
Yeah. You?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.136
I'm glad you guys are.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.205
Still can't get over
you being back.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.674
TORRES:
Yeah, really.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.842
It's like it never happened.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.578
And as pleased as I am that
you are both back to work,

07:57.611 --> 07:59.780
I trust that you will keep
your appointments today.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.214
Planning on it,
Director.

08:01.248 --> 08:02.650
Good.
Clean slates for everybody.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.618
From here on out,
we go by the book,

08:04.652 --> 08:05.719
or we go home.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.621
Yeah, I got it.
Bishop is in charge.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.056
That's right.
Update.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.758
See? By the book.

08:10.791 --> 08:11.759
McGEE:
Lieutenant Richard Coyne.

08:11.792 --> 08:15.128
32, married, no kids.
Once a SEAL candidate.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.630
He was forced out
of BUD/S training

08:16.664 --> 08:17.631
due to a shoulder injury,

08:17.665 --> 08:19.767
though he continued to
train for triathlons.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.869
Tracked down his wife,
living in Falls Church.

08:21.902 --> 08:22.803
Reported him missing
18 months ago.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.137
That's one day after

08:24.171 --> 08:26.840
his command
reported him U.A.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.843
What?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.244
Nothing.

08:31.278 --> 08:36.116
So, he just disappeared
for no apparent reason?

08:36.149 --> 08:38.919
Oh, no, there was a reason,
but the cops couldn't prove it.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.253
Coyne disappeared one week
before he was supposed to

08:40.287 --> 08:41.822
testify as a key witness

08:41.855 --> 08:44.692
at this drug dealer's trial,
Leo Vairo.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.127
Six months before, Lieutenant
Coyne stopped a robbery

08:47.160 --> 08:48.261
at a local health club.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.330
A masked man shot and wounded

08:50.363 --> 08:52.600
the owner of the health club,
Pete Wilkins,

08:52.633 --> 08:53.967
before Coyne jumped him.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.335
Robber escaped,

08:55.368 --> 08:56.837
but Coyne managed
to see his face

08:56.870 --> 08:58.205
and I.D. Vairo for the cops.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.840
Multiple drug arrests,
burglaries.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.975
Jail terms.
He was looking at three strikes.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.311
Yeah, and without Coyne's
testimony, he walked.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.715
No record of him since,
and his whereabouts are unknown.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.182
ALL:
BOLO.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.350
BISHOP:
So, uh...

09:10.383 --> 09:12.620
McGee and I will
notify Coyne's wife.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.087
Gibbs, you and Torres
go to the cemetery,

09:14.121 --> 09:15.823
talk to the
funeral director.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.791
Wait, wait, wait,
why do I have to go back there?

09:17.825 --> 09:19.359
BISHOP: Well,
you said the groundskeepers

09:19.392 --> 09:21.028
bury sealed caskets,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.997
so it seems to me
we should talk to whoever

09:24.031 --> 09:25.866
sealed that old woman's.
Oh, I know,

09:25.899 --> 09:27.868
but why, why do I have
to go back there?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.069
Is this...

09:29.102 --> 09:30.838
is this about me
doubting you again?

09:30.871 --> 09:32.906
Yes.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.942
I'm kidding, Nick.

09:34.975 --> 09:38.045
Okay, if you're
that spooked, I can go.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.780
Oh, no, I-I'm not spooked.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.815
I-I didn't say "spooked."

09:43.383 --> 09:45.819
Oh, Gibbs!

09:46.954 --> 09:48.321
Cemetery it is.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.261
I-I knew it.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.896
I knew he hadn't just run off.

09:55.929 --> 09:58.098
I knew... he had to be dead,

09:58.131 --> 10:01.769
but somehow hearing it...

10:01.802 --> 10:03.070
BISHOP:
Mrs. Coyne...

10:03.103 --> 10:05.272
How is it possible?

10:05.305 --> 10:08.308
How'd that creep
sneak him into the cemetery?

10:08.341 --> 10:09.877
That creep being Leo Vairo?

10:09.910 --> 10:13.246
I don't say his name,
but who else?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.848
Have you arrested him yet?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.283
We will when we find him.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.687
Saving a man's life,
it wasn't enough.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.955
I begged Richie not to testify.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.925
Why? Had he,
had he been threatened?

10:24.958 --> 10:28.295
No, but I know he felt it.

10:28.328 --> 10:31.131
As the trial got closer, he got
physically ill with the strain.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.134
His bad shoulder,
his back, his stomach.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.970
But he wouldn't back down.

10:37.004 --> 10:40.674
Richie always had
to be the hero.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.075
You know what, I'm gonna
go check that BOLO.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.011
(quietly):
Okay.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.947
And you're saying
he'd been buried?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.882
Like, in a coffin
and everything?

10:48.916 --> 10:50.718
(door closes)

10:50.751 --> 10:53.286
JENSEN:
I came in as soon as I heard.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.455
Let's go to my office.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.925
Things like this
just don't happen, Agents,

10:57.958 --> 10:59.159
not in all my years.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.961
Well, it happened, Jensen.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.930
Anything you can tell us
on the old lady's funeral,

11:02.963 --> 11:04.097
Edna Stone?

11:04.131 --> 11:05.332
Yeah, let's see.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.201
Edna passed away...

11:08.235 --> 11:09.970
uh, two Christmas Eves ago.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.705
Uh, platinum package,
no viewing,

11:11.739 --> 11:13.807
small service,
26 mourners.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.242
Service take place
at the gravesite?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.410
Uh, no, at our
in-house chapel.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.079
It was a brutal winter.

11:19.112 --> 11:22.082
Ground was frozen solid,
making it impossible to dig,

11:22.115 --> 11:25.418
so we stored our winter
decedents until the spring thaw.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.255
Uh, May 11,
in Edna's case.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.090
Coyne went missing May 8.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.224
Yeah, sometime between
then and May 11,

11:31.258 --> 11:33.260
his body got into
Edna's casket.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.996
Can't imagine how.
I-I personally lock each one.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.965
There's no way anyone could've
done that without being seen.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.733
You have more of these around?

11:39.767 --> 11:42.269
JENSEN: You're welcome
to check all our video,

11:42.302 --> 11:44.471
but our system only saves the
last few months at a time.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.239
Surely, it's been
recorded over by now.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.140
There you are.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.876
Excuse me, ma'am,
we're in the middle

11:48.909 --> 11:50.844
of something right now...
Don't you "ma'am" me.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.913
First you move
my mother's grave.

11:52.946 --> 11:56.116
Now, I hear she's had
a roommate all this time?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.517
You're Edna's daughter.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.286
How quickly they forget.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.754
TORRES: Ma'am, any connection
between Lieutenant Coyne

12:00.788 --> 12:02.055
and your mother, or any reason

12:02.089 --> 12:03.490
why your mother's coffin
was targeted?

12:03.523 --> 12:05.826
What do you mean "targeted"?

12:05.859 --> 12:07.527
Who is Lieutenant Coyne...

12:07.560 --> 12:08.996
Who are you?

12:09.029 --> 12:09.797
NCIS.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.464
This is a criminal
investigation.

12:11.498 --> 12:12.532
Any connection, ma'am,
between...
Okay.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.834
Wait a minute.
Now you think

12:13.867 --> 12:16.036
my mother ran with criminals?

12:16.069 --> 12:19.072
Let me tell you this:
that woman drove us all nuts,

12:19.106 --> 12:20.373
but she never
(phone rings)

12:20.407 --> 12:22.009
missed a day of church. Ever.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.344
Uh, yeah, Bishop.
Do you know what
that means?

12:24.377 --> 12:26.213
BISHOP:
No hits on the BOLO yet, Gibbs.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.081
Uh, McGee has a "thing,"

12:28.115 --> 12:30.884
so I was gonna head over to
Coyne's gym, scene of the crime.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.319
You want to meet me?

12:32.352 --> 12:34.521
Uh, no, you know,
I kind of got a thing, too,

12:34.554 --> 12:36.924
so I'm gonna send Torres.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.526
All right, what is with
you guys and these things.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.529
We all know it's therapy.
Let's just call it what it is.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.398
Uh, no, no, no.
It's a psych evaluation.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.500
Okay? So technically
not therapy.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.970
Well, I wish I was in therapy.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.809
(knocking on door)
Come in.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.311
Hey. I know I'm early.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.480
Uh, Gibbs, is everything okay?
No, I just got here

13:00.513 --> 13:01.849
faster than I thought.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.183
You want me to wait out here?
No, no, no.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.952
Don't leave. Stay, sit. I mean,

13:04.985 --> 13:06.286
I mean, um...

13:06.319 --> 13:08.121
g-grab a seat
and get a water, and...

13:08.155 --> 13:10.490
(dialing)

13:10.523 --> 13:12.325
(quietly): Hey, um, I hate
to do this, but do you think

13:12.359 --> 13:14.995
you could try and catch
my 3:00 and postpone?

13:15.028 --> 13:18.031
Um, apologize
for the short notice.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.833
Family emergency.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.068
Thanks.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.837
I thought I was your 3:00.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.505
Who knew you'd show up?

13:25.538 --> 13:28.175
Like I had a choice.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.543
Never stopped you before.

13:45.025 --> 13:49.062
Been getting stared at
a lot since we got back.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.064
I'm sure.

13:51.098 --> 13:54.034
For most, it's likely disbelief,

13:54.067 --> 13:56.269
and gratitude
that you're home safe.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.471
And for me, it's that,

13:58.505 --> 14:00.507
and that you're here at all.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.212
How does it feel?

14:05.245 --> 14:06.947
To be stared at?

14:08.315 --> 14:10.117
This mean we're starting?

14:10.150 --> 14:13.053
Yes, Gibbs, my assessment
of your mental health has begun.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.222
Commence with
the one-word answers.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.090
Now who's being glib?

14:17.124 --> 14:18.591
Sorry.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.195
Where were we?

14:22.229 --> 14:25.132
How I feel being stared at.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.299
And?

14:26.333 --> 14:28.001
Uh...

14:28.035 --> 14:29.202
I-I don't know.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.537
I-I feel...

14:33.173 --> 14:35.575
(chuckles)

14:35.608 --> 14:37.577
Happy.
Happy?

14:37.610 --> 14:40.013
Yeah.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.215
To be alive.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.452
Grateful.
Grateful.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.954
Yeah, look, I-I've
survived worse.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.189
I cheated death a bunch, but...

14:49.222 --> 14:52.459
this was different.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.128
(exhales)

14:55.162 --> 14:57.630
I thought it was over.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.301
I feel different.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.402
You seem different.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.337
I mean, what did I call you
this morning-- sunnier.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.139
Hey, it's not like

15:06.173 --> 15:09.176
I'm whistling rainbows
or anything like that, I...

15:09.209 --> 15:14.281
I mean, maybe,
I don't... I don't know.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.017
Even after they tortured you?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.088
It's in your file.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.289
Torture, starvation.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.991
I can't even imagine.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.959
We can talk about that.

15:25.993 --> 15:31.098
I'm more interested
in where it left me.

15:31.131 --> 15:36.003
I don't know why or how,
but it's not where I expected.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.038
I feel like I
just want to...

15:40.473 --> 15:44.411
...savor being back.

15:51.218 --> 15:52.619
What is so funny?

15:52.652 --> 15:55.322
I'm not laughing, I am smiling.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.624
Well, why you smiling?
Well, why not?

15:57.657 --> 16:00.193
If you'll pardon
the cliché, Gibbs,

16:00.227 --> 16:01.995
if I didn't know any better,

16:02.029 --> 16:05.198
I'd say you just might have
a new lease on life.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.200
You think?

16:07.234 --> 16:10.237
You've just said more to me
about how you feel

16:10.270 --> 16:11.671
in the last two minutes

16:11.704 --> 16:14.141
than in all the time
that I've known you.

16:14.174 --> 16:17.577
If that's not a new you,
I don't know what is.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.386
(rock music playing)

16:26.419 --> 16:28.755
Hey-- ooh.
Everything okay?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.357
TORRES:
Yeah. Peachy.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.325
Crazy lady yelled at me
at the funeral home. You?

16:32.359 --> 16:34.727
BISHOP: Mm. Sounds like
you're having quite the day.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.496
I hate cemeteries, okay?
Mm.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.231
All that messing
with the dead stuff.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.167
It just gets in your head
and you can't shake it.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.668
All right, well,
forget the dead.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.570
Look, you are
amongst the living.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.772
Yeah. Thank you.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.208
So much life here!

16:49.442 --> 16:51.444
(grunts)

16:51.478 --> 16:53.146
(tire thuds)
(chuckles)

16:53.180 --> 16:54.381
(grunting):
Okay.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.715
Ooh.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.317
Your back?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.286
Nope, I'm fine.
The dead can't mess with me.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.587
Just a little tight.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.355
You okay?
Oh.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.623
Yeah, oh, I'm fine.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.258
(chuckles)
I'm totally fine.

17:05.292 --> 17:09.496
Just an old injury from, uh,
stopping a-a drug lord.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.165
Whole cartel, really,
you know, the whole gang.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.300
It's no big deal.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.334
Hmm.
(sighs)

17:14.367 --> 17:15.635
Hi.
Hi.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.170
Do you know where
the owner is, Pete Wilkins?

17:17.204 --> 17:18.271
He's here.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.073
I just saw him heading
for his office.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.441
Uh, I'm with a client,
or I'd take you myself.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.509
No, that's okay,
we'll find him.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.510
Just right up the stairs.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.544
Just be sure to knock.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.778
He's with his girlfriend.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.314
Ooh.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.849
And you mind that old
injury, Jason Bourne.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.085
Most definitely.

17:32.119 --> 17:33.320
BISHOP:
See?

17:33.353 --> 17:36.323
Jason Bourne, your day
is getting better already.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.462
PETE:
I can't wait for...

17:42.495 --> 17:43.863
Hello?
(knocks on door)

17:43.896 --> 17:45.432
Pete Wilkins...?

17:46.699 --> 17:48.235
Mrs. Coyne?

17:48.268 --> 17:50.337
Oh, God.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.572
This must look terrible.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.074
Oh, it looks worse than that.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.784
PETE:
The first time we met was when

18:04.817 --> 18:06.719
she and Richie came
and visited me at the hospital.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.854
After he saved your life?

18:07.887 --> 18:09.689
Yeah, if he wouldn't have
stepped in front of Vairo,

18:09.722 --> 18:11.124
I would've been dead for sure.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.559
So there was no
love triangle.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.161
Never.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.528
Pete and I barely
knew each other

18:15.562 --> 18:17.197
before Richie
went missing.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.232
That's the crazy part.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.235
Richie was just
a member at Pete's gym.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.705
He risked his life
for an acquaintance.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.440
That's just the kind of guy
Richie was.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.210
We, uh, got a lot closer
after he saved my life.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.878
We started rehabbing together.

18:31.911 --> 18:32.912
Your gunshot wound?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.614
And Richie's shoulder.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.617
He threw it out
when he tackled that creep.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.819
The pain,
it was worse than ever.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.221
How could I not
feel responsible?

18:41.254 --> 18:43.490
Now, he-he was really
in pain, so we, uh,

18:43.523 --> 18:44.624
we worked out here
most every day.

18:44.657 --> 18:45.725
BISHOP:
Until...

18:45.758 --> 18:47.227
he went missing.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.463
And that's when I got
to know Pete.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.732
We were so concerned
about Richie.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.167
PETE:
We were so disgusted

18:54.201 --> 18:55.935
seeing Vairo go free.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.205
So we, uh,

18:58.238 --> 19:00.307
Donna and I, we, uh, we, you
know, we kind of came together

19:00.340 --> 19:01.708
to comfort each other.

19:01.741 --> 19:05.278
And after a year and a half, uh,
what can I say?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.847
We fell in love.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.249
PETE:
And now with Richie

19:09.282 --> 19:10.517
turning up dead,

19:10.550 --> 19:12.185
look, just promise me

19:12.219 --> 19:13.886
that I get to testify
at Vairo's trial this time.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.655
Okay?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.557
As soon as we find him.
That bastard shot me

19:17.590 --> 19:19.392
over $200 in my safe.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.660
If I'd have just given it
to him,

19:20.693 --> 19:22.229
none of this
would've ever happened.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.197
And your friend would
still be alive.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.533
I think about that
more than ever.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.368
Me, too.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.744
GRACE: Uh, yes,
this is Dr. Confalone

19:37.777 --> 19:40.447
for, uh, Director Vance, please?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.415
WOMAN: One moment.
Thank you.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.751
VANCE:
Dr. Confalone.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.220
Oh, yes, Director,
I'm sorry to bother you.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.356
It's not Gibbs?
No, it's not about Gibbs.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.459
In fact, I'm signing
his psych eval as we speak.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.362
What is it?
I'm afraid it's about
Agent McGee.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.396
(elevator bell dings)

19:58.030 --> 19:59.532
McGee.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.268
Hey.
You're back at work.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.735
Yeah.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.437
Oh.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.606
Are you sure it's not too soon?

20:06.639 --> 20:08.941
I'm not sure of much,
to be honest with you.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.411
So, how's the casket?

20:11.444 --> 20:13.413
You mean the Rolls-Royce
of caskets?

20:13.446 --> 20:15.014
That Edna was one lucky lady.

20:15.047 --> 20:18.951
This is, by far, the cushiest
casket on the market.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.321
Selling it or examining it?
I mean, if it wasn't
"pre-owned,"

20:21.354 --> 20:22.955
I'd be all over this thing.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.292
Mine at home
is getting so lumpy.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.260
How did Lieutenant Coyne's body
get in here?

20:27.294 --> 20:28.127
Not with the help of anyone

20:28.160 --> 20:30.263
from the funeral parlor
or the cemetery.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.265
How do you know that?
Because this beauty
was pried open.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.833
See these marks right here?

20:33.866 --> 20:35.835
It took several times
to break the lock.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.471
Probably why it opened
so easily when it was dropped.

20:38.505 --> 20:39.706
And no one at the cemetery
has a crowbar?

20:39.739 --> 20:40.773
Not when it's, like,

20:40.807 --> 20:43.410
a million times easier
to just use a casket key.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.312
They'd be the only ones
that would have one.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.346
You have one.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.447
I also have a casket.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.986
DUCKY:
This indignity

20:54.020 --> 20:56.289
will soon be over, Edna.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.325
And we'll have you back
to your resting place.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.694
No further disturbance,
I promise.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.863
And a lot more elbow room.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.698
How's it coming, Dr. Palmer?

21:05.732 --> 21:07.767
Uh, not bad,
once my eyes stopped watering.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.936
This guy is ripe.

21:09.969 --> 21:13.573
Another ringing endorsement for
the virtues of embalming fluid.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.343
(bagpipe ringtone plays)
(grunts)

21:16.376 --> 21:18.345
JIMMY:
Hey, Doctor,

21:18.378 --> 21:19.379
I don't mean to be nosy,

21:19.412 --> 21:20.513
but, uh,
you've been grumbling

21:20.547 --> 21:22.081
about those phone calls
all week.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.082
Who is that?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.951
Edinburgh University.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.453
It's that time of year

21:26.486 --> 21:30.089
when they seek an increase
in my alumni dues.

21:30.122 --> 21:35.628
They'll just have to get by with
my current levels of generosity.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.397
Oh, how generous is that?

21:37.430 --> 21:38.765
Now you are being nosy.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.468
GIBBS: Hey, Duck,
what do we got? Whew!

21:41.501 --> 21:43.436
Wow, that's gotten worse.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.236
Yeah, I was thinking about

21:44.270 --> 21:45.705
hanging a warning sign
out there.

21:45.738 --> 21:46.573
Leave the door open.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.907
Nobody's gonna get off
the elevator.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.476
Jethro, these little fibers

21:49.509 --> 21:50.977
will hopefully point us

21:51.010 --> 21:55.548
to whomever intruded
into Edna's casket.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.984
Oh. What about the lieutenant?

21:58.017 --> 21:59.986
Oh, yeah, the, uh,
the blunt force

22:00.019 --> 22:01.488
narrowly missed his
squamosal suture,

22:01.521 --> 22:04.824
which likely contributed,
but I highly doubt

22:04.857 --> 22:06.493
it was the cause of death.

22:06.526 --> 22:07.860
(coughs)
Yeah, all this decay has got me

22:07.894 --> 22:09.462
off to a really slow start,

22:09.496 --> 22:11.864
but, yeah, I should have plenty
to send up to Abby.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.099
Okay, keep me posted.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.133
Oh, oh, Jethro, Jethro.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.134
I know it's been said

22:15.167 --> 22:17.103
many times of late,

22:17.136 --> 22:19.138
but do allow me to echo

22:19.171 --> 22:21.374
the resounding chorus

22:21.408 --> 22:23.743
of our peers
in welcoming you...

22:23.776 --> 22:26.012
Duck, Duck, come on.
Echo faster, huh?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.383
It's good to have you back.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.918
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, I'm glad to be here.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.153
(chuckles)

22:34.186 --> 22:35.988
You did that on purpose.

22:36.022 --> 22:39.091
Well, I meant every word.
(chuckles)

22:40.126 --> 22:41.494
BISHOP:
Any updates?

22:41.528 --> 22:42.829
McGEE: Abby's still working
on the casket.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.163
GIBBS: Ducky and Palmer
are mid-autopsy.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.700
Whew. Uh, you might want to
burn that jacket.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.836
What do you got?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.805
Uh, trying to link Leo Vairo

22:52.839 --> 22:54.441
to any of our players here.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.643
Social media,
hometowns in common, schools.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.445
But there's no
connections so far.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.612
We may not
need connections.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.613
Our BOLO?

23:00.647 --> 23:02.148
Virginia State Police
just picked up Leo Vairo

23:02.181 --> 23:03.916
working at a used car lot
in Springfield.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.117
Let's get him in here.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.456
LEO VAIRO:
I was the victim.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.823
Mistaken identity.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.192
That Navy fella might have
picked me out of a lineup,

23:13.225 --> 23:14.827
but he got it wrong.

23:14.861 --> 23:15.962
TORRES:
Well, your criminal record

23:15.995 --> 23:18.197
makes that really hard
to believe.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.533
LEO:
Yeah, I screwed up plenty.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.735
But I've been clean
18 months now.

23:22.769 --> 23:23.836
18 months.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.138
About the same time
Lieutenant Coyne disappeared,

23:26.172 --> 23:28.174
you avoided a third strike.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.609
That was a miracle,

23:29.642 --> 23:32.679
I know,
but it scared me straight.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.614
You think Coyne disappearing
is a miracle?

23:34.647 --> 23:35.848
LEO:
It was to me.

23:35.882 --> 23:39.552
I had nothing to do with it
and have no idea where he went.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.820
Nor do I care.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.622
Well, you should care,

23:42.655 --> 23:44.056
'cause he's dead.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.495
He's dead?

23:48.528 --> 23:49.962
You found him?

23:49.996 --> 23:51.564
Take a guess where.
Is that why

23:51.598 --> 23:53.566
you got me down here?
TORRES: Damn.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.568
You figured that out
all by yourself?

23:57.604 --> 24:01.541
In that case, I need a lawyer.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.946
Yeah, I'd say he needs one, too.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.214
McGEE: I can definitely
imagine this guy

24:08.247 --> 24:10.249
prying open a casket
or two.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.118
Oh, he's lawyering
up for a reason.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.054
Is there a reason for
this afternoon, Agent McGee?

24:15.087 --> 24:17.089
Oh, my, uh, psych eval.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.925
I'm all ears.
I was actually headed there,

24:18.958 --> 24:21.227
um, but something came up
at home.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.995
Delilah and I are, you know,

24:23.029 --> 24:24.664
trying to get back
into the swing of things.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.732
Understandably.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.233
Actually, I was hoping, um,

24:27.266 --> 24:29.669
I could make it home
tonight for dinner

24:29.702 --> 24:30.803
if there isn't anything else

24:30.837 --> 24:32.605
case-related
keeping me here.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.807
Good by me. Leon?

24:34.841 --> 24:35.942
Of course.

24:37.977 --> 24:41.914
Of course, you will see Dr.
Grace by end of day tomorrow.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.916
Or just stay home
until you do.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.018
Yeah.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.189
(door closes)

24:50.222 --> 24:53.192
JIMMY: So much for
getting used to the smell.

24:53.225 --> 24:55.695
(exhales)

24:55.728 --> 24:58.531
If I didn't know any better,
I'd swear it's getting worse.

24:58.565 --> 25:02.068
Just as too much salt
will dull the taste buds,

25:02.101 --> 25:06.673
a lifetime of autopsies has
dulled my olfactory nerve.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.941
Yeah, but a salt factory
don't taste bud.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.209
Come again?

25:10.242 --> 25:13.613
Paper cut floor action...

25:14.947 --> 25:16.248
Ducky?

25:16.282 --> 25:18.184
Step away from the body.
Do it now.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.652
Get away from the table!

25:19.686 --> 25:20.820
(alarm ringing)

25:36.068 --> 25:37.737
Ugh.

25:37.770 --> 25:40.272
The plastic helps, Ducky,
but the smell's not much better.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.741
GIBBS:
Trust me,

25:41.774 --> 25:42.575
it's a lot better.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.777
It wasn't the smell
that took him out.

25:44.811 --> 25:47.780
His delirium
points to something far worse.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.248
Wait, wait, I was delirious?

25:49.281 --> 25:50.717
DUCKY:
Incoherent.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.118
You called me Ducky.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.253
Palmer, what's the last
thing you remember?

25:54.286 --> 25:58.024
Let's see, I was taking a sample
from the liver.

25:58.057 --> 26:01.961
And then the smell got bad
and then it got much worse.

26:01.994 --> 26:05.732
And... now I'm laying
on an autopsy table.

26:05.765 --> 26:08.167
DUCKY: Since the liver
acts as a filter,

26:08.200 --> 26:10.336
a concentration of toxins
built up,

26:10.369 --> 26:12.772
enough to fell
a seasoned professional.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.674
Thank you, Doctor.

26:14.707 --> 26:15.975
What kind of toxins
are we talking about?

26:16.008 --> 26:18.010
Well, that's up to Abby
to ascertain

26:18.044 --> 26:19.846
once I've cut
out a sample.

26:19.879 --> 26:23.315
I suggest you two leave and
take Dr. Palmer with you.

26:23.349 --> 26:24.684
What? No.

26:24.717 --> 26:25.885
Absolutely not.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.386
Whatever did this
to me, Doctor,

26:27.419 --> 26:29.388
I-I want it. Bad.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.891
Oh.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.894
Spoken like
a true medical warrior.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.329
Ooh. All right.
You're on your own.

26:40.900 --> 26:41.934
(sighs)

26:41.968 --> 26:44.303
And to think they
actually enjoy this.

26:44.336 --> 26:48.107
Uh-huh. Face it,
we all enjoy this.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.278
How'd your psych
eval go today?

26:52.311 --> 26:56.048
Not... not specifically,
just in terms of

26:56.082 --> 26:57.884
you resuming "boss" duties.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.753
I thought it went well.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.755
I haven't heard.

27:02.789 --> 27:06.325
I mean, no clearance yet.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.262
If you want to go home
for the night, I can stay.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.430
Are you kidding?

27:11.463 --> 27:13.399
This is your first day back.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.134
No, Torres and I will stay.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.103
I don't mind.
Well, I mind.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.270
And I'm still boss.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.839
So...

27:19.872 --> 27:22.274
you go home, Gibbs.

27:23.710 --> 27:24.877
That's an order.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.746
(elevator bell dings)

27:26.779 --> 27:28.848
And take a shower.

27:30.449 --> 27:31.951
(chuckles)

27:34.821 --> 27:36.355
(knocking on door)

27:36.388 --> 27:38.024
Is it safe
to come in?

27:38.057 --> 27:40.793
All clear. Jimmy hasn't
brought the sample down yet.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.195
(grunts) I'm not taking
any chances today.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.698
Did you hurt your back?
Yeah.

27:45.732 --> 27:48.334
I tweaked it flipping this, um,

27:48.367 --> 27:51.738
like, giant tire.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.273
Now, why would you
flip over a giant tire?

27:54.306 --> 27:56.108
It was there.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.711
Any other questions?
Yeah.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.113
You still on about this whole
"messing with the dead" thing?

28:01.147 --> 28:02.749
Okay, how does this happen?

28:02.782 --> 28:04.817
I tell one person,
now everybody knows?

28:04.851 --> 28:06.118
Okay, you told three.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.387
And dead people
can't mess with you, Nick.

28:08.420 --> 28:11.423
Actually, they're in
a very unique position not to.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.960
Yeah, okay, go ahead
and tell that to Jimmy.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.394
Actually,
I have a theory on that.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.797
It sounds like
a Toxic Lady case to me.

28:17.830 --> 28:18.597
Toxic Lady?
Yeah.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.299
In the mid-'90s,
there was a woman

28:20.332 --> 28:22.301
who was being treated
for cervical cancer.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.937
And she got rushed to
the E.R. for chest pains

28:24.971 --> 28:26.305
and trouble breathing.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.907
When she was getting
her blood drawn,

28:27.940 --> 28:30.142
all the hospital staff
that was near her

28:30.176 --> 28:31.978
got a strong whiff
of something,

28:32.011 --> 28:34.914
and they all got
violently ill.
What was it?

28:34.947 --> 28:37.383
Well, eventually, the theory was
that there was a cocktail

28:37.416 --> 28:39.385
of the cancer medication
that had gotten clogged

28:39.418 --> 28:41.220
in her bloodstream,
and then it crystallized

28:41.253 --> 28:43.022
when it was exposed to oxygen.

28:43.055 --> 28:46.458
It made this toxic gas,
and it took out half the room.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.160
Um, there's still debates
(elevator bell dings)

28:48.194 --> 28:50.229
about the hows and the whys.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.431
Those hows and whys
sound good to me.

28:53.933 --> 28:56.002
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Am I supposed
to wear one of those,

28:56.035 --> 28:58.004
uh, Abby's space suits or...?

28:58.037 --> 29:00.206
No, you're good, Nick. I-I
sealed these babies up tight.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.308
And, plus, you're not staying.
So, out.

29:02.341 --> 29:03.542
Hey, no argument here.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.946
Uh, argument: I need to know.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.783
(blows)

29:10.817 --> 29:13.886
(insects chirping)

29:13.920 --> 29:16.055
(dog barks in distance)

29:25.064 --> 29:27.066
*

29:32.038 --> 29:34.907
(doorbell rings)

29:43.916 --> 29:46.318
Since when do you
lock your door?

29:47.319 --> 29:49.321
Ah. Right.

29:51.991 --> 29:52.959
(door locks)

29:52.992 --> 29:55.461
Problem sleeping?

29:55.494 --> 29:57.229
Oh, I could ask you
the same thing.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.899
Not enough to show up
at your place at 3:00 a.m.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.001
Well, I didn't want to keep
Delilah up another night

30:02.034 --> 30:03.836
with my tossing and turning.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.404
What's going on?

30:05.437 --> 30:08.407
Well, maybe it's all that
time we spent sleeping

30:08.440 --> 30:09.909
on that cell floor.

30:09.942 --> 30:12.144
Mattresses are hard
to get used to again.

30:12.178 --> 30:14.246
Yeah. How's Delilah doing?

30:14.280 --> 30:15.481
How's the baby?

30:15.514 --> 30:16.949
McGEE:
Baby's good.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.217
Delilah's fantastic.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.853
We came from an ultrasound
a few days ago.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.321
We don't want to know
what we're having,

30:22.354 --> 30:25.257
but, uh, baby's growing.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.860
So...

30:27.894 --> 30:30.196
what are you doing here?

30:36.969 --> 30:40.006
We spent two months, Tim,
getting beat up,

30:40.039 --> 30:42.508
tortured, starved.

30:43.542 --> 30:47.146
All that time...

30:47.179 --> 30:50.249
I never saw you as scared
as you are right now.

30:51.283 --> 30:53.652
I'm not scared, boss.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.522
To be honest with you,
I don't know what I am.

30:56.555 --> 30:59.158
I don't know...

30:59.191 --> 31:02.394
what to feel
or why I'm feeling like I do.

31:02.428 --> 31:05.231
So why'd you blow off Grace?
Boss, we can't all be you, okay?

31:05.264 --> 31:09.135
You came home from Paraguay
like it was nothing.

31:09.168 --> 31:12.038
But maybe I can't do that.

31:12.071 --> 31:15.041
And you had it worse
than I did.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.043
And you're cracking jokes
and smiling

31:17.076 --> 31:19.245
like you never have before.
Who said that I had it worse?

31:19.278 --> 31:21.047
Gibbs, you were beat more,
you were tortured more.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.115
And you had to watch.

31:23.149 --> 31:25.084
Just because I'm
cracking jokes,

31:25.117 --> 31:27.586
Tim, doesn't mean I'm okay.

31:29.956 --> 31:33.225
I'm okay... enough.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.227
Maybe.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.997
Enough to pass your psych eval.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.698
Yeah. You don't think you will?
What if I don't?

31:39.731 --> 31:41.533
What if I can't fake it
like you?

31:41.567 --> 31:43.135
Fa-Fake it?

31:43.169 --> 31:44.103
Wait, no, no,

31:44.136 --> 31:45.637
who's faking it here?

31:45.671 --> 31:48.140
Boss, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it like that.

31:48.174 --> 31:50.276
Look, all I'm trying
to tell you is I feel like...

31:50.309 --> 31:52.344
I feel like the guy
who's avoiding the doctor

31:52.378 --> 31:54.646
because he doesn't want
to find out how sick he is.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.049
No, you're not like that guy,
McGee. You are that guy.

31:57.083 --> 32:00.052
Just go.

32:03.155 --> 32:06.092
Just go.
(phone ringing)

32:06.125 --> 32:08.127
What if I have
to keep going?

32:08.160 --> 32:10.396
I'll see you there.

32:10.429 --> 32:13.165
I guess.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.701
ABBY: Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
I was right.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.003
Toxic Lady.

32:17.036 --> 32:17.869
GIBBS: Who?
Blunt force trauma

32:17.903 --> 32:19.638
may have knocked out
Lieutenant Coyne,

32:19.671 --> 32:22.041
but it was a cocktail of drugs
in his liver that killed him.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.476
ABBY: Fentanyl,
dimethyl sulfoxide

32:24.510 --> 32:25.577
and a whole bunch of ibuprofen.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.046
JIMMY:
It was a triple dose,

32:27.079 --> 32:29.081
most likely for the
pain in his shoulder.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.383
That combo of drugs
was put into pill form,

32:31.417 --> 32:33.752
which crystallized
when Jimmy cut into the liver

32:33.785 --> 32:35.521
and the fumes
just knocked him out.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.024
JIMMY: Now, ibuprofen is sold
over the counter,

32:38.057 --> 32:40.492
but where would Lieutenant Coyne
go to get all those other drugs?

32:40.526 --> 32:43.129
No. Question is, who would've
slipped them to him?

32:43.162 --> 32:44.096
We can think of someone.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.376
Ah. I tried to get here early,
you still beat me in.

32:57.409 --> 32:59.311
Ah, no, I never left.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.712
Showered in the gym.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.415
I keep a change of clothes
in my locker.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.217
Yeah, that's a good idea
for a boss.

33:05.251 --> 33:06.485
I don't feel so boss.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.054
Digging into
Vairo's record

33:08.087 --> 33:11.423
and there's not
one hint of him

33:11.457 --> 33:13.559
ever dealing with the drugs
Abby found last night.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.694
All his busts were
for pot and coke.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.129
And no DMSO?

33:17.163 --> 33:18.364
What is that?

33:18.397 --> 33:20.132
D-M-S-O.
Look that up for me.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.233
So, last night
I was putting

33:21.267 --> 33:22.334
sports cream on my back

33:22.368 --> 33:23.569
and I was wishing
I had this stuff

33:23.602 --> 33:25.137
that, uh, that a doctor
in Colombia gave me

33:25.171 --> 33:26.505
last time I tweaked it.

33:26.538 --> 33:29.441
BISHOP: "DMSO, AKA
dimethyl sulfoxide."

33:29.475 --> 33:31.243
Yep. Sound familiar?

33:31.277 --> 33:33.312
BISHOP: Yeah, it's what Coyne
had in his system

33:33.345 --> 33:34.480
along with fentanyl
and ibuprofen.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.315
They're all types
of pain killers.

33:36.348 --> 33:37.349
Now, we know Coyne was in pain,

33:37.383 --> 33:39.518
but you don't take DMSO
as a pill.

33:39.551 --> 33:40.752
Yeah, yet he took all three.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.054
McGEE:
Saw Vairo's lawyer

33:42.088 --> 33:43.322
on my way in.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.490
Says her client

33:44.523 --> 33:46.658
is not talking
and she wants him out now.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.660
Ah, doubt he'd be much good
to us, anyway.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.697
He's not exactly
the sports injury type.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.367
What are you thinking, Gibbs?

33:55.401 --> 33:59.505
I am thinking that Vairo
won't have to say much.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.473
That we'll do all the talking

34:01.507 --> 34:04.510
after you look up
one more thing.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.511
Mm-hmm.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.546
(Bishop typing)

34:07.579 --> 34:09.681
ATTORNEY: Premeditated murder
is a long way

34:09.715 --> 34:11.517
from armed robbery, agents.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.385
Mr. Vairo isn't talking
until we see some basis

34:13.419 --> 34:14.786
for your allegations.
Cool.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.556
Well, our basis are
a list of these drugs

34:17.589 --> 34:19.458
that were found
in Coyne's system.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.327
Recognize any of them, Leo?

34:21.360 --> 34:23.395
Can't hardly pronounce them.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.097
Yeah, we doubt
you sold them.

34:25.131 --> 34:27.533
I mean, you dealt mostly in
recreational drugs, right?

34:27.566 --> 34:29.501
Weed, blow.
I was good, too.

34:29.535 --> 34:30.536
Mr. Vairo.

34:30.569 --> 34:31.737
BISHOP: We thought
maybe that's how

34:31.770 --> 34:33.872
you knew the gym owner.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.741
Turns out Pete was hit

34:35.774 --> 34:37.409
with a misdemeanor
coke possession

34:37.443 --> 34:38.544
a few years ago.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.446
TORRES: Wasn't your
coke on him, was it?

34:40.479 --> 34:41.480
I mean, he told us
he didn't even know

34:41.513 --> 34:42.548
who you were before, uh,

34:42.581 --> 34:43.549
before the robbery.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.284
Pete said that?
Leo.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.051
TORRES: Rock and
a hard place, Leo.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.819
You admitting
to knowing Pete

34:47.853 --> 34:50.122
and you're pretty much
confessing to shooting him.

34:50.156 --> 34:51.557
BISHOP: Yeah,
I don't know, Leo.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.492
I mean, you seem, you
seem smarter than that.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.361
How stupid would you have to be
to rob a gym?

34:55.394 --> 34:56.628
TORRES:
Seriously.

34:56.662 --> 34:58.797
The guy didn't even have
200 bucks in the safe.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.599
I mean, you got to
be an idiot

35:00.632 --> 35:01.600
to shoot a guy over that.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.502
It was way more than that.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.740
Look, I didn't kill
this Navy guy.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.609
I get why you think I did,
but I didn't.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.211
TORRES: Then help us
figure out who did.

35:12.244 --> 35:13.212
Why did you rob the gym?

35:13.245 --> 35:15.314
(stammers, stops)

35:15.347 --> 35:17.516
Oh, go for it.

35:17.549 --> 35:19.818
I knew Pete back in the day.

35:19.851 --> 35:22.154
Sold to him a few times.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.856
A couple years ago,
I hear he's making a bundle

35:24.890 --> 35:26.625
off this wonder drug,

35:26.658 --> 35:28.760
importing it
from South America.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.696
Some kind of miracle
pain killer.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.531
PETE:
Look, guys.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.600
Richie was my friend.
He saved my life.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.735
I mean, what,
are-are you gonna believe

35:36.768 --> 35:38.670
some trigger-happy drug dealer?
TORRES: We normally don't,

35:38.704 --> 35:40.606
but now...

35:40.639 --> 35:41.873
Okay, did-did he happen to say

35:41.907 --> 35:43.575
how I got the body
in the casket?

35:43.609 --> 35:44.576
Much less the cemetery?

35:44.610 --> 35:46.478
Now here's a good shot.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.580
I... don't touch my stuff,
please.

35:48.614 --> 35:49.681
(chuckles)
Look at that.

35:49.715 --> 35:52.218
Gorton Poly High School, 2001.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.552
Varsity football.

35:53.585 --> 35:54.586
There you are.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.621
Number 2-5.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.656
Look at the size of your neck.

35:57.689 --> 35:58.890
Where have I
seen this before?

35:58.924 --> 36:01.693
Oh, that's right,
um... I know.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.595
The, uh, the yearbook
we dug up online

36:03.629 --> 36:04.696
trying to connect
our suspects.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.232
What?
How could I be a suspect?

36:06.265 --> 36:07.266
Check this out.

36:07.299 --> 36:08.500
Good-looking kid, huh?

36:08.534 --> 36:12.271
Let's see where's
that, uh, team photo?

36:12.304 --> 36:13.939
Oh, wow, look at that.
It's the same shot.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.474
You're not just
a football player,

36:15.507 --> 36:17.709
you were a co-captain, Pete.
There you are.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.578
Huh?

36:19.611 --> 36:21.747
Who's your
buddy there?

36:36.295 --> 36:38.364
I needed the money, okay?

36:42.668 --> 36:45.237
Well, so much for
taking one for the team.

36:45.271 --> 36:46.705
He's spilling
his guts out.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.574
(sighs)

36:48.607 --> 36:49.741
Look, just leave Phil
out of this.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.543
He didn't have
anything to do with it.

36:51.577 --> 36:54.012
All he did was
get me access to the casket

36:54.045 --> 36:56.448
and then he just...
he looked away.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.250
TORRES:
That miracle drug

36:58.284 --> 36:59.918
did a real number
on your other buddy.
Look, I was just

36:59.951 --> 37:01.587
trying to help him.

37:01.620 --> 37:02.654
Richie was
in so much pain.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.923
His shoulder was killing him.
TORRES: Yeah, sure,

37:04.956 --> 37:07.293
along with everything else
when you started helping him.
No.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.295
Nobody else had a reaction
like that. I didn't know...

37:09.328 --> 37:11.763
Look, I didn't know what to do.
You take him to the hospital.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.532
Oh, but he couldn't
do that, Gibbs,

37:13.565 --> 37:14.766
'cause they'd find out that
Rich was poisoned.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.669
No, he wasn't poisoned, okay?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.705
And I got rid
of my supply after...

37:19.738 --> 37:21.573
After you killed him.
No, I didn't kill him.

37:21.607 --> 37:24.543
It killed him, and it was
an accident. All right, look,

37:24.576 --> 37:25.944
Richie comes by the gym

37:25.977 --> 37:28.447
after-hours one night,
on his way to the base.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.616
And he's in pain
and he's blaming me.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.651
And then things
just got out of hand

37:32.684 --> 37:34.686
and we got physical and, uh,
the next thing I know,

37:34.720 --> 37:36.455
Richie just... he just fell.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.823
He fell?
Yeah. He just fell.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.391
I'm assuming
he fell on something

37:39.425 --> 37:40.992
heavy and hard.
He hit the barbell rack.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.329
He didn't even hit it
hard enough for it to kill him,

37:43.362 --> 37:44.596
but he, uh...

37:46.365 --> 37:48.367
...he was dead.

37:50.669 --> 37:53.004
What about Donna?

37:54.706 --> 37:57.743
Does Donna
have to know about this?

37:57.776 --> 37:59.778
I mean, with everything
she's been through.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.683
You okay?

38:05.751 --> 38:07.753
I want to testify at his trial.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.361
Lingering effects?

38:15.394 --> 38:17.363
Oh. No, I'm fine.
Thanks, Doctor.

38:17.396 --> 38:19.030
I was just...
thinking about that poor woman.

38:19.064 --> 38:20.732
Loses her husband

38:20.766 --> 38:23.502
and then falls for the man
who killed him.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.872
"Death leaves a heartache
no one can heal.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.575
Love leaves a memory
no one can steal."

38:29.608 --> 38:30.876
That's nice.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.978
It was carved
on a headstone

38:33.011 --> 38:35.113
in Ireland
centuries ago.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.916
Yeah. No one
does death

38:37.949 --> 38:39.885
quite like the Irish.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.687
You really should write a book.
Yeah, yeah.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.722
In all my free time.
ABBY: Registered letter

38:43.755 --> 38:46.625
for "The Esteemed
Dr. Donald Mallard."

38:46.658 --> 38:48.093
I signed for it. It's from
the University of Edinburgh.

38:48.126 --> 38:51.062
Must be important.
Hardly. Thank you, Abby.

38:51.096 --> 38:54.132
To the circular file,
please, Dr. Palmer.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.968
No, I'm not throwing this away.
Now you're being ridiculous.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.705
Oh, please don't.
He doesn't want us to know

38:59.738 --> 39:01.707
how much he gives
to his old school.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.609
Because it's none
of your business.
"To the Honorable

39:03.642 --> 39:05.544
Dr. Mallard..."
Yada, yada, yada.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.079
"Attempts to reach you
have failed."

39:08.113 --> 39:09.381
Not well enough.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.550
Doctor...

39:11.583 --> 39:14.720
this is not a solicitation,
this is an invitation.

39:14.753 --> 39:17.523
ABBY: "The University
requests your presence

39:17.556 --> 39:18.790
"at a weekend honoring

39:18.824 --> 39:21.627
its most distinguished alumni."

39:21.660 --> 39:24.095
JIMMY: "At which
you will be a guest of honor

39:24.129 --> 39:25.831
"and awarded
the honorary degree,

39:25.864 --> 39:27.966
Doctor of Humane Letters."

39:29.601 --> 39:31.403
Has to be a prank.

39:31.437 --> 39:32.404
It's not a prank.

39:32.438 --> 39:33.672
You're the bestest,

39:33.705 --> 39:35.040
baddest, Duckiest,

39:35.073 --> 39:37.843
most legendary medical
examiner of all times,

39:37.876 --> 39:39.845
and, obviously,
they know.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.513
JIMMY:
It's pretty cool, Doctor.

39:41.547 --> 39:42.948
How much do you
donate, by the way?

39:42.981 --> 39:44.049
Shame on me.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.751
What?
For allowing

39:45.784 --> 39:48.720
my cynicism to reject
all those phone calls.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.756
That's true.
You might never have known.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.560
But now that you do know?

39:56.528 --> 39:58.897
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

40:01.867 --> 40:03.502
(chuckles)

40:03.535 --> 40:05.837
Delilah has been a champ.
You know?

40:05.871 --> 40:08.774
She was a total rock
while I was gone.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.909
Can't say enough.
Yeah, you've been saying it

40:10.942 --> 40:12.511
for most of the hour.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.446
We've got
five minutes left, Tim.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.047
Tell me why you're not sleeping.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.716
I told you
I don't know.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.451
Pretend you do.

40:19.485 --> 40:20.886
Take a chance.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.689
What is it you don't know?

40:23.722 --> 40:25.090
(sighs)

40:29.495 --> 40:31.830
I don't know...

40:31.863 --> 40:33.832
why I've been worrying so much

40:33.865 --> 40:35.901
since we got back.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.604
It was hard enough surviving
Paraguay, but you'd think

40:38.637 --> 40:40.672
there would be nothing left
to fear after that.

40:40.706 --> 40:42.908
You certainly had reason
to be afraid down there.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.543
That was different.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.778
We stared death
in the face every day,

40:46.812 --> 40:48.647
but I knew that,
somehow, we'd get back.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.248
A wife at home,
baby on the way.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.651
Perhaps fear wasn't an option.

40:52.684 --> 40:54.486
There was no time to be afraid.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.622
But now you have time.
I just can't shake this feeling

40:56.655 --> 40:57.856
like the other shoe
is gonna drop.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.492
Like I've run out of luck

41:00.526 --> 41:02.561
and... something's
bound to go wrong.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.963
There's some
big scoreboard out there

41:04.996 --> 41:06.832
that keeps track
of who's had enough hardship

41:06.865 --> 41:08.834
and who's owed some more?

41:08.867 --> 41:10.836
Sounds crazy when you
put it like that.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.504
Maybe a little.

41:12.538 --> 41:14.840
Misfortune is
pretty arbitrary, after all.

41:14.873 --> 41:15.974
Well, I don't
know about that.

41:16.007 --> 41:18.510
Some people
seem to just skate by

41:18.544 --> 41:20.979
while others
are magnets for disaster.

41:21.012 --> 41:21.680
Which one are you?

41:23.248 --> 41:24.883
Somewhere in the middle,
I guess.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.685
We're all in the middle, Tim.

41:26.718 --> 41:30.155
Despite appearances,
everybody's got a story to tell.

41:30.188 --> 41:32.724
No one gets through
this life unscathed.

41:32.758 --> 41:34.926
Is that... is that
supposed to help me sleep?

41:34.960 --> 41:36.595
Worry's a bully.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.930
It gives you nothing,

41:38.964 --> 41:41.567
it only takes.
Just wish

41:41.600 --> 41:42.868
I could enjoy the ride more,
you know?

41:42.901 --> 41:44.936
Quit obsessing
about what lies ahead.

41:46.938 --> 41:50.576
All the danger that you've faced
over the years, Tim--

41:50.609 --> 41:53.645
that experience
was put to the test down there.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.581
And you passed
with flying colors.

41:55.614 --> 41:58.116
So whatever lies ahead,

41:58.149 --> 42:00.085
you're more prepared
to deal with it

42:00.118 --> 42:03.521
than you've ever been before
in your life.

42:06.658 --> 42:10.028
And I will file your paperwork
later tonight,

42:10.061 --> 42:12.030
and let Director Vance

42:12.063 --> 42:13.599
know you're good to go.

42:13.632 --> 42:15.033
That'd be great.
Hey, boss.

42:15.066 --> 42:17.002
Told you I'd see you here.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.169
Been here the entire time?

42:18.203 --> 42:20.305
About ten minutes.
Keep getting here early.

42:20.338 --> 42:22.273
But she's got good magazines.

42:23.809 --> 42:24.643
You ready?

42:24.676 --> 42:26.712
And able.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.182
Hey, you going home?

42:33.384 --> 42:34.853
I'm going to bed.

42:36.722 --> 42:38.056
Yeah.
