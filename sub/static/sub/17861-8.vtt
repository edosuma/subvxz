WEBVTT

00:00.295 --> 00:02.390
A contraceptive diaphragm.

00:02.624 --> 00:05.502
It physically blocks the semen.

00:05.504 --> 00:09.364
And the spermicide you smear on it
also has an effect.

00:09.365 --> 00:11.305
This isn't dirty or wrong.

00:11.309 --> 00:13.589
Not if we're honest with everyone.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.479
I'd like to take you on a picnic
tomorrow, just the two of us.

00:16.481 --> 00:18.681
Aren't you sick of me?
Never.

00:18.784 --> 00:20.502
Her behaviour has been absolutely...

00:20.504 --> 00:22.582
There are explanations
for everything she has done!

00:22.584 --> 00:25.302
Our bed is an icefield.

00:25.304 --> 00:26.942
Then warm it.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.862
I will never respect you again.

00:29.864 --> 00:33.302
That side of you.
It's over.

00:33.304 --> 00:34.824
You remember Harry.

00:36.864 --> 00:38.424
Hello, James.

01:00.024 --> 01:02.222
That's it.

01:02.224 --> 01:04.501
Come about. Come on. Come around.

01:04.504 --> 01:06.142
Round now, that's it.

01:06.144 --> 01:07.584
Father!

01:09.784 --> 01:12.102
Come! It's Grandmother!

01:12.104 --> 01:15.222
They shouldn't
have... called you.

01:15.224 --> 01:18.502
It's a good thing they did.
It's a lot of fuss.

01:18.504 --> 01:19.582
Mother?

01:19.584 --> 01:21.222
We found her collapsed.

01:21.224 --> 01:23.022
How serious, Jack?
Serious.

01:23.024 --> 01:25.582
Just put me to bed.
We need to get her to hospital.

01:25.584 --> 01:28.302
No, my own bed.
Mother, Jack is the doctor.

01:28.304 --> 01:30.862
Oh. Oh!

01:30.864 --> 01:32.662
I'll be perfectly fine.
Elizabeth!

01:32.664 --> 01:35.782
Go to the hospital, please!
Elizabeth, listen to me.

01:35.784 --> 01:38.742
Listen to me. Do you want to die?

01:38.744 --> 01:41.864
Because if you stay here,
it is a distinct possibility.

01:42.864 --> 01:45.864
Lean on me. Come on.

01:48.424 --> 01:51.584
It's alright.

01:59.224 --> 02:01.502
Sister! Emergency.
We need a wheelchair outside.

02:01.504 --> 02:03.382
You're back.
Yes.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.142
We're bringing Elizabeth in.
Her heart?

02:05.144 --> 02:06.464
Yeah.

02:16.104 --> 02:20.942
Hey, Col, stop mucking around and
make yourself useful. Grab a plank.

02:20.944 --> 02:22.302
They're too heavy.

02:22.304 --> 02:23.582
Slacker.

02:23.584 --> 02:26.222
What did those poor old ants ever do
to deserve getting fried?

02:26.224 --> 02:28.462
They're why you're pulling
that down.

02:28.464 --> 02:32.142
White ants, you silly galoot,
not that sort.

02:32.144 --> 02:35.302
Leave them be. Go on, scoot.

02:35.304 --> 02:37.302
He's fine where he is.

02:37.304 --> 02:39.624
Run and get Mr James
a drink of water.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.344
I don't need one, thank you.

02:43.504 --> 02:44.862
Go on, mate.

02:44.864 --> 02:46.064
Oh!

02:55.304 --> 02:57.502
We used to be friends.

02:57.504 --> 02:59.502
We're not kids anymore.

02:59.504 --> 03:01.222
We weren't kids then.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.302
We were young.

03:03.304 --> 03:06.224
It wasn't my idea to come back.
Someone's got to help.

03:07.824 --> 03:09.742
You're not worried I'm going to...

03:09.744 --> 03:11.584
I don't want to talk about it.

03:13.024 --> 03:14.502
OK.

03:14.504 --> 03:15.824
Ever.

03:18.304 --> 03:21.942
You haven't wondered what I've been
doing all these years?

03:21.944 --> 03:23.822
Can't say I have.

03:23.824 --> 03:24.904
James!

03:28.024 --> 03:30.102
Grandmother's been taken
to the hospital.

03:30.104 --> 03:32.184
What? What's happened?
I'll explain on the way.

03:33.464 --> 03:35.784
Miss Anna.

03:36.864 --> 03:38.382
Harry!

03:38.384 --> 03:40.502
Oh, my, I...
I didn't even recognise you.

03:40.504 --> 03:42.102
It's been over five years.

03:42.104 --> 03:44.382
I'm sorry, I can't...
Go to your gran.

03:44.384 --> 03:46.264
I'll see to the horse.
I'll fetch him later.

03:47.224 --> 03:49.104
James!

03:51.224 --> 03:53.142
I'm not here to cause trouble.

03:53.144 --> 03:54.504
James!

04:03.024 --> 04:06.024
Will I put this laundry
away for you, ma'am?

04:07.464 --> 04:09.144
Oh, yes, in the dresser.

04:10.304 --> 04:12.584
You should be eating.
It's good for the baby.

04:14.184 --> 04:16.382
I'm not hungry.

04:16.384 --> 04:19.502
No news from the hospital yet,
but do not worry.

04:19.504 --> 04:22.544
I am sure things will work out
for the best.

04:25.304 --> 04:26.984
Yes, I hope so.

04:41.024 --> 04:43.462
How is she?
She's, uh... she's finally settled.

04:43.464 --> 04:45.502
And?

04:45.504 --> 04:47.182
She'll pull through.

04:47.184 --> 04:48.822
Thank you, Jack.

04:48.824 --> 04:50.742
What caused it?

04:50.744 --> 04:52.742
Well, she's a woman
with a heart condition

04:52.744 --> 04:54.662
who keeps acting like
a woman without one.

04:54.664 --> 04:56.182
And the treatment?

04:56.184 --> 04:58.142
The only remedy is rest,
and more rest.

04:58.144 --> 05:01.222
And no stress, so I want to
keep her here to guarantee it.

05:01.224 --> 05:03.102
Can we see her now?

05:03.104 --> 05:05.382
I think it's best
if you come back in the morning.

05:05.384 --> 05:07.862
Take Anna home.
I'd like to stay for a while.

05:07.864 --> 05:10.582
Alright, not too long. She's
sedated. I ask you not to disturb
her.

05:10.584 --> 05:13.264
Of course. I'll let you know
if anything changes.

05:15.384 --> 05:16.864
Thanks again.

05:43.024 --> 05:44.904
This is ridiculous.

05:46.664 --> 05:49.544
All this fuss.
Don't excite yourself.

05:50.904 --> 05:52.544
It's entirely unnecessary.

06:03.224 --> 06:06.022
How is she?
Bad, but better.

06:06.024 --> 06:08.462
Good-o. Your horse
is round the side.

06:08.464 --> 06:10.862
See you at home, then?

06:10.864 --> 06:12.864
Amy's back there somewhere.
She's been worried.

06:15.024 --> 06:17.384
Help Miss Anna, Col.

06:20.664 --> 06:23.942
Just so you know,
I've never told anyone about us.

06:23.944 --> 06:26.142
I never will.

06:26.144 --> 06:27.142
Good.

06:27.144 --> 06:28.902
What are you so scared of?

06:28.904 --> 06:32.704
I'm not scared.
You're something.

06:34.544 --> 06:36.584
I'm married.
Amy said.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.542
I won't lie.

06:41.544 --> 06:44.462
Sometimes I wondered
what it'd be like to come back.

06:44.464 --> 06:46.104
You shouldn't have.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.582
I'd like to hear a bit
about your life.

06:50.584 --> 06:53.544
I can tell you a few things about
mine, you know, normal things.

06:55.024 --> 06:56.584
Normal?

06:58.424 --> 07:01.424
Are you married, Harry?
No.

07:04.224 --> 07:05.984
Step away from the car.

07:41.464 --> 07:43.022
Have you spoken to your mother yet?

07:43.024 --> 07:44.944
No. Papa's in the shed.

07:46.784 --> 07:48.862
What is it?

07:48.864 --> 07:50.942
Grandmother's had a heart attack

07:50.944 --> 07:53.502
and she's in the hospital.

07:53.504 --> 07:57.942
And all I want to do is hold you.
This is all wrong.

07:57.944 --> 07:59.262
Cara...

07:59.264 --> 08:01.382
Dr Duncan says
she's not going to die.

08:01.384 --> 08:03.182
But she's so sick.

08:03.184 --> 08:05.302
We can't tell about us, not now.

08:05.304 --> 08:07.502
The only thing that matters
is your nonna.

08:07.504 --> 08:11.782
OK? You just have to be patient
till your nonna can take the news.

08:11.784 --> 08:14.062
The shock, you mean.

08:14.064 --> 08:15.024
Smile.

08:16.824 --> 08:17.824
Better.

08:18.944 --> 08:20.422
Miss Anna!

08:20.424 --> 08:22.424
Mr Poletti!

08:25.424 --> 08:28.302
It has to come at the right time.
Just remember.

08:28.304 --> 08:29.304
OK.

08:32.823 --> 08:34.384
Why Miss Anna come here?

08:36.904 --> 08:38.544
Some bad news.

09:15.464 --> 09:19.302
I would say nothing, of course,
but others may find it highly
irregular,

09:19.304 --> 09:21.422
one of yours
standing up at a christening.

09:21.424 --> 09:24.982
One of mine?
You understand, Miriam.

09:24.984 --> 09:27.102
A Jew?
Exactly.

09:27.104 --> 09:29.302
Jesus was a Jew, Doris.

09:29.304 --> 09:32.782
Oh, no, dear. Jewish?
I don't think so.

09:32.784 --> 09:35.702
I know Sister Adams performed
a miracle with the birth,

09:35.704 --> 09:38.942
but Eve's got quite carried away,
asking her to be godmother.

09:38.944 --> 09:40.062
Miriam.

09:40.064 --> 09:42.422
Oh, Sister Adams.
Back from the city, I see.

09:42.424 --> 09:43.902
Mm, this morning.
Oh.

09:43.904 --> 09:46.742
Sarah, I was so sorry to hear
about your mother's passing.

09:46.744 --> 09:48.782
I wish you long life.

09:48.784 --> 09:50.902
Thank you.
Oh, yes indeed.

09:50.904 --> 09:52.462
My condolences.

09:52.464 --> 09:55.502
Yes, well, um, it's my day
for the CWA newsletter.

09:55.504 --> 09:58.544
Oh, perhaps you might distribute
these amongst the female patients.

10:00.104 --> 10:02.784
Such kvetching over a christening.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.662
You're going to be
the baby's godmother, yeah?

10:06.664 --> 10:08.342
I was asked.

10:08.344 --> 10:10.702
Who thought I would say
such a thing?

10:10.704 --> 10:13.822
But Doris might have a point.

10:13.824 --> 10:18.024
It could make a scandal
even more a scandal, no?

10:19.544 --> 10:20.944
Perhaps.

10:21.944 --> 10:23.424
What's brought you here?

10:29.304 --> 10:31.264
Come in.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.382
Oh! Alma said you'd gone.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.622
It was so mad here this morning

10:37.624 --> 10:40.182
I completely forgot to ask
how you're holding up. Are you OK?

10:40.184 --> 10:43.782
Yeah, thanks. Uh, Miriam Goldberg's
hoping to see you.

10:43.784 --> 10:44.864
Problem?

10:47.304 --> 10:49.022
It's about Guy Fawkes Night.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.502
Oh, yeah, right.
That's crept up on us.

10:51.504 --> 10:54.022
Leah has a rough time of it.
Did Miriam explain?

10:54.024 --> 10:55.382
A little.

10:55.384 --> 10:57.502
Send her in.

10:57.504 --> 11:00.304
Elizabeth, she'll be alright,
won't she?

11:01.304 --> 11:04.342
She's out of the woods, yeah,
but she'll be in for a while.

11:04.344 --> 11:08.022
I will keep my head down, then.
Good on you. We're in the same boat.

11:08.024 --> 11:10.024
We're both the last thing
her blood pressure needs.

11:21.144 --> 11:22.782
Excuse me, Mr James.

11:22.784 --> 11:25.422
Do you mind if I put
the room in order?

11:25.424 --> 11:27.264
Of course.

11:33.024 --> 11:37.222
I have not had a chance to say yet
how happy we are to see you back,

11:37.224 --> 11:40.984
looking so fine
and with such a beautiful wife.

11:43.064 --> 11:44.384
Thank you.

11:46.024 --> 11:47.664
And Miss Anna.

11:48.704 --> 11:52.702
She must have had some handsome
young suitors in England.

11:52.704 --> 11:55.262
Anna? No.

11:55.264 --> 11:58.744
So there was no special young man
for her while you were travelling?

11:59.984 --> 12:03.624
Grandmother just introduced her
to a highly eligible chap.

12:05.064 --> 12:06.544
To very little effect.

12:09.304 --> 12:10.902
Excuse me.

12:10.904 --> 12:11.904
Mm.

12:24.864 --> 12:25.984
Yes?

12:26.944 --> 12:28.382
Miss Anna.

12:28.384 --> 12:31.502
Carla, you don't have to
call me "miss".

12:31.504 --> 12:34.264
Here,
yes.
No, that's silly.

12:37.504 --> 12:40.182
I've come to ask if there's anything
before I go.

12:40.184 --> 12:43.742
No, thank you.
And thank you for this morning.

12:43.744 --> 12:46.184
I don't know what we would have done
without you.

12:47.944 --> 12:51.184
Now you must try your hardest to
make your grandmother a happy woman.

12:52.544 --> 12:54.022
Mr James tells me

12:54.024 --> 12:57.102
Mrs Bligh has chosen a handsome
young man for you to marry.

12:57.104 --> 12:58.702
Ah, him.

12:58.704 --> 13:01.262
Well, there are some things
I won't do,

13:01.264 --> 13:03.184
not even to make Grandmother happy.

13:07.424 --> 13:09.184
Miss Anna...
Anna!

13:11.024 --> 13:13.422
I put your laundry away
in the top drawer of your dresser,

13:13.424 --> 13:16.264
if you're looking for
anything special.

13:40.344 --> 13:41.542
Ciao, Mamma.

13:41.544 --> 13:44.464
Take a load of your feet, huh?

13:46.104 --> 13:49.422
You must be worried about Mrs Bligh.
How do you know about Mrs Bligh?

13:49.424 --> 13:51.824
I saw Anna when she was out riding.

13:53.424 --> 13:55.024
I see.

13:56.104 --> 13:57.624
Just by chance.

13:58.624 --> 13:59.824
Accident.

14:15.178 --> 14:16.378
George.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.656
How are you? Are you alright?

14:19.658 --> 14:21.656
It's been a shock.

14:21.658 --> 14:23.736
She's sleeping like a baby.

14:23.738 --> 14:27.096
She's in good hands, but if
there's anything I can do to help...

14:27.098 --> 14:30.096
Thank you.
I'm surprised to see you here.

14:30.098 --> 14:33.298
I was just seeing how things went so
I could hit the ground running
tomorrow.

14:34.738 --> 14:36.936
Have you finished?
Yes.

14:36.938 --> 14:39.016
I'll drive you home.

14:39.018 --> 14:41.018
I'd like that.

15:12.898 --> 15:14.016
Sleep.

15:14.018 --> 15:16.258
I refuse to die.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.378
I refuse to let you.
Hm.

15:23.258 --> 15:24.978
You're a good boy.

15:28.018 --> 15:29.818
So like...

15:31.018 --> 15:32.418
So...

15:34.098 --> 15:35.578
Oh, I don't like it.

15:37.738 --> 15:39.576
Disagree.

15:39.578 --> 15:41.418
Nor do I.

15:43.218 --> 15:44.936
If I've said anything...

15:44.938 --> 15:47.858
Whatever the stoush,
you'll come through it.

15:50.058 --> 15:51.458
Always.

15:53.378 --> 15:56.218
I would never hurt you.

15:57.658 --> 15:58.978
Never.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.018
Not like your f...

16:05.298 --> 16:06.538
Like?

16:08.018 --> 16:09.458
So like him.

16:21.378 --> 16:22.816
If a broad-minded person

16:22.818 --> 16:24.456
like Miriam Goldberg's
reacting like that,

16:24.458 --> 16:26.096
it's hard not to wonder.

16:26.098 --> 16:28.096
I've been having doubts
about our involvement as well.

16:28.098 --> 16:30.056
Considering Bert's attitude and...
Yes.

16:30.058 --> 16:33.096
Perhaps we could talk about it
at the picnic tomorrow.

16:33.098 --> 16:34.776
Oh, I-I thought we'd postpone.

16:34.778 --> 16:36.976
Why? Because of my mother?
Yes.

16:36.978 --> 16:40.176
Like you said, she...
she's in good hands.

16:40.178 --> 16:43.256
Midday outside the hospital,
if that suits.

16:43.258 --> 16:45.498
I'll get cook to rustle up a hamper.

16:51.058 --> 16:52.696
You getting chauffeured around
these days.

16:52.698 --> 16:54.976
This town only needs one gossip,

16:54.978 --> 16:58.338
and Doris Collins
has the position filled.

17:07.137 --> 17:09.218
Where have you been?

17:10.458 --> 17:11.498
Why?

17:12.498 --> 17:14.336
I heard Anna's voice ages ago.

17:14.338 --> 17:16.698
You must have been back
for some time.

17:23.778 --> 17:25.938
Why didn't you go to the hospital
with Grandmother?

17:27.137 --> 17:30.658
I didn't want to get in the way.
It showed a certain lack of concern.

17:31.618 --> 17:35.776
Yes. I won't be
going to the hospital. At all.

17:35.778 --> 17:38.976
Of course you will!
I think it's for the best.

17:38.978 --> 17:40.776
You have to.

17:40.778 --> 17:43.816
I refuse to stand there
pretending I care.

17:43.818 --> 17:45.376
This is ridiculous.

17:45.378 --> 17:46.896
I can't be so hypocritical.

17:46.898 --> 17:48.976
Whatever you feel,
you have to do what's right.

17:48.978 --> 17:51.816
Like your grandmother did by me?

17:51.818 --> 17:53.898
Olivia!
I said no.

17:56.978 --> 17:58.936
How can I explain it, then?

17:58.938 --> 18:00.616
I'm pregnant.

18:00.618 --> 18:03.056
Say that I don't need the stress

18:03.058 --> 18:05.136
of seeing my darling
grandmother-in-law suffer.

18:05.138 --> 18:06.978
What has got into you?

18:09.018 --> 18:12.618
I'm simply prepared to admit
what you must have thought.

18:13.818 --> 18:16.138
We'd all be better off if she died.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.456
That is utterly poisonous.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.738
And utterly true.

18:37.738 --> 18:39.536
You know, it wasn't until I met you

18:39.538 --> 18:42.696
that I truly appreciated a beer
on the veranda after a long day.

18:42.698 --> 18:45.016
Nothing beats it.

18:45.018 --> 18:46.338
Cheers.

18:48.498 --> 18:49.578
Oh!

18:52.738 --> 18:54.778
Did you know George Bligh's wife?

18:57.778 --> 18:59.176
Fine woman.

18:59.178 --> 19:01.656
In what way?

19:01.658 --> 19:03.938
Just about every way
you can imagine.

19:07.658 --> 19:10.016
Has he courted anyone since?

19:10.018 --> 19:13.296
I thought there was room
for only one gossip in this town.

19:13.298 --> 19:17.576
I'm not gossiping, I'm...
I'm just interested.

19:17.578 --> 19:19.858
A bloke's not blind.

19:21.698 --> 19:25.416
I thought you and I were of the same
mind when it come to people's past.

19:25.418 --> 19:27.616
It's their right to tell it
as they see fit.

19:27.618 --> 19:30.418
My thoughts haven't changed.
Well, something has.

19:35.058 --> 19:37.056
Blood pressure is down.

19:37.058 --> 19:38.058
Good.

19:39.098 --> 19:40.218
Yes.

19:41.498 --> 19:44.296
You still got pain?
Oh, a little.

19:44.298 --> 19:47.618
Nausea? Dizziness?
No.

19:50.498 --> 19:52.898
I thought I'd been forgiven.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.058
You're a lot more reasonable
when you're sedated.

19:58.378 --> 20:00.216
Jack, what are you talking about?

20:00.218 --> 20:04.056
We had an entire conversation
you seem to have forgotten.

20:04.058 --> 20:06.096
I was assuming I'd been pardoned.

20:06.098 --> 20:07.858
Oh, I see.

20:09.378 --> 20:13.256
Well, I don't intend to be held
to any drug-addled ramblings.

20:13.258 --> 20:17.378
It made a lot more sense
than this lemon-lipped act.

20:20.058 --> 20:22.618
Either we clear the air
or I'll transfer you to the city.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.376
You need rest,
not tension, Elizabeth.

20:26.378 --> 20:29.696
Might I remind you, it was
your defying me over Sarah Adams

20:29.698 --> 20:31.256
that helped put me here.

20:31.258 --> 20:33.538
I gave you
some well-needed home truths.

20:34.498 --> 20:36.816
You gave me insolence
and ingratitude.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.696
OK, that's it. City.

20:38.698 --> 20:40.656
No, I'm not going!

20:40.658 --> 20:43.136
You need a doctor who won't upset
you simply by being there.

20:43.138 --> 20:45.016
I'll get you another sedative
and arrange a transfer.

20:45.018 --> 20:48.138
Jack, after all I've done for you.
Just stop!

20:49.898 --> 20:53.376
If I took your blood pressure now
it'd be way up again.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.778
You're killing yourself. Now please.

20:57.418 --> 20:59.138
I don't want to go elsewhere.

21:00.218 --> 21:02.256
And I don't want to send you.

21:02.258 --> 21:04.378
Give me a choice, huh?

21:06.218 --> 21:12.656
I remember lying in the gutter -
literally -

21:12.658 --> 21:14.818
and you reaching your hand down
and saying, "Trust me."

21:17.298 --> 21:19.098
I did, and you saved me.

21:21.138 --> 21:22.778
Let me return the favour.

21:27.698 --> 21:32.096
♪ When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie

21:32.098 --> 21:34.778
♪ That's amore

21:36.698 --> 21:41.376
♪ When the world seems to shine

♪ That's amore... ♪

22:04.978 --> 22:06.658
Angelo Poletti.

22:15.778 --> 22:18.858
I'm going to ask you a question,
and I want an honest answer.

22:20.178 --> 22:22.858
What is happening
between you and Anna Bligh?

22:33.338 --> 22:37.496
How can you be engaged?
If it's a secret, it doesn't exist.

22:37.498 --> 22:39.376
It's a lie.
Don't say that.

22:39.378 --> 22:41.136
We're in love.

22:41.138 --> 22:45.896
Everything we have,
everything we owe to that family.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.016
We were going to tell them,
you and Papa.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.776
But Mrs Bligh got sick.
That's your excuse?

22:49.778 --> 22:52.216
It's not an excuse, I swear.
We were going to tell everyone.

22:52.218 --> 22:56.256
Tell everyone what? That you've been
doing unspeakable things?

22:56.258 --> 22:58.258
Is love unspeakable now?

23:00.098 --> 23:02.936
I found something in her bedroom,

23:02.938 --> 23:06.738
a vile thing the Holy Father forbids.

23:09.098 --> 23:11.938
It's not what you think!

23:13.218 --> 23:15.936
Move! Or do you want your papa
to know what you have done?

23:15.938 --> 23:18.336
He's going to know when Anna and I
decide to tell everyone.

23:18.338 --> 23:20.736
Your father's lost one son.

23:20.738 --> 23:22.896
Think what it will do to him
to lose another.

23:22.898 --> 23:24.456
Mamma, listen to reason.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.896
Do you really think
they're going to let you marry?

23:26.898 --> 23:29.136
Why not?
You're a Catholic.

23:29.138 --> 23:31.536
Her family won't allow it.

23:31.538 --> 23:33.178
The Church won't allow it.

23:34.618 --> 23:37.418
Someone like her is not for you.

23:40.418 --> 23:42.056
She thinks she is.

23:42.058 --> 23:45.378
It's my mother who thinks
I'm worthless.

23:48.098 --> 23:49.496
Carla!

23:49.498 --> 23:52.658
Nothing. Do you hear?
Nothing to your father.

23:54.698 --> 23:56.176
Si, caro.

23:56.178 --> 23:57.818
I'm coming!

24:48.338 --> 24:49.896
You're looking much better
this morning.

24:49.898 --> 24:51.816
Well, I don't know why.

24:51.818 --> 24:53.536
I'm being woken every hour,

24:53.538 --> 24:57.216
and I'm on a mattress that harbours
who knows what infectious horrors.

24:57.218 --> 24:59.536
You gave us such a fright.

24:59.538 --> 25:03.816
Olivia sends her apologies.
She's... not feeling well.

25:03.818 --> 25:04.896
Ah.

25:04.898 --> 25:06.658
She wishes you a speedy recovery.

25:08.218 --> 25:12.736
So, Olivia unwell. What else?

25:12.738 --> 25:14.538
Nothing of any consequence.

25:17.258 --> 25:18.896
Anna?

25:18.898 --> 25:20.976
Nothing of consequence either?

25:20.978 --> 25:22.538
No.

25:24.058 --> 25:26.018
You sure?

25:30.138 --> 25:33.256
Harry's back!
Who?

25:33.258 --> 25:35.056
Amy's brother. Harry!

25:35.058 --> 25:36.536
And you should see him.

25:36.538 --> 25:38.416
He is a lot different
to when he left.

25:38.418 --> 25:41.016
He's staying as long as
she needs the help.

25:41.018 --> 25:43.056
Oh, Harry.

25:43.058 --> 25:45.376
He wasn't up to much, as I recall.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.016
Didn't we let him go, George?
He moved on.

25:48.018 --> 25:50.336
Well, there you are.
No to be relied on.

25:50.338 --> 25:53.456
James, you keep an eye on things.
Make sure Amy has what she needs.

25:53.458 --> 25:55.138
I will.

25:57.058 --> 25:58.536
Well, I can't imagine

25:58.538 --> 26:01.176
what nonsense you're all
getting up to in my absence.

26:01.178 --> 26:04.176
The same old boring things.
You've got a suspicious mind.

26:04.178 --> 26:08.938
Hm. Methinks you all protest
too much.

26:16.618 --> 26:20.216
The one thing about your mother,
she is shrewd.

26:20.218 --> 26:22.176
I felt like a ten-year-old
with a secret.

26:22.178 --> 26:25.176
Blushing and in short pants.

26:25.178 --> 26:28.018
Well, we both know if she got wind
of this, she probably would die.

26:30.618 --> 26:33.138
Sorry, that...
I make my own decisions.

26:34.098 --> 26:35.096
And...

26:35.098 --> 26:36.736
And if it wasn't for her heart,

26:36.738 --> 26:38.658
I would have no hesitation
in telling her.

26:43.258 --> 26:46.658
However, I didn't invite you here
to discuss my mother.

26:47.938 --> 26:51.178
I've been contemplating the problem
of the christening.

26:52.898 --> 26:54.258
Oh, yes.

26:55.418 --> 26:57.896
Well, we both know Eve invited us
for sentimental reasons,

26:57.898 --> 26:59.456
which is understandable,

26:59.458 --> 27:01.616
but we're not the most appropriate
of choices.

27:01.618 --> 27:03.536
What do you suggest?

27:03.538 --> 27:05.736
Amy and Harry.

27:05.738 --> 27:08.056
I could say I feel awkward
cutting them out,

27:08.058 --> 27:10.536
and we could both keep
a protective eye over the baby.

27:10.538 --> 27:12.498
An elegant solution.
Thank you.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.536
Under different circumstances

27:17.538 --> 27:20.698
I would have liked very much
to have shared the honour with you.

27:24.858 --> 27:27.536
So... here we are.

27:27.538 --> 27:29.018
Yes.
Yes.

27:32.618 --> 27:34.298
Thank you.

27:44.890 --> 27:46.850
Carla, have you seen
my blue neckerchief?

27:47.122 --> 27:48.642
No, miss.

27:52.962 --> 27:55.200
Carla's in a strange mood today.

27:55.202 --> 27:57.642
I hadn't noticed.

27:58.602 --> 28:01.360
You should come to
the hospital tomorrow.

28:01.362 --> 28:03.282
It really isn't that grim.

28:04.962 --> 28:06.842
The baby comes first.

28:08.202 --> 28:10.362
Grandmother's quite cheery.

28:11.722 --> 28:13.442
I don't like hospitals.

28:15.242 --> 28:16.960
Is that all it is?

28:16.962 --> 28:19.362
What else would it be?

28:22.282 --> 28:24.722
We don't share things
like we used to.

28:25.722 --> 28:27.282
There's nothing to share.

28:28.282 --> 28:30.202
It's all about resting for the baby.

28:31.922 --> 28:33.442
Alright.

28:38.522 --> 28:40.722
It's nothing you've done, Anna.

28:42.722 --> 28:46.082
Well, as long as it's not.
It's not.

28:50.002 --> 28:51.842
Enjoy your ride.

29:12.202 --> 29:14.680
It's a beautiful spot, isn't it?
It's lovely.

29:14.682 --> 29:16.840
I used to come here a lot

29:16.842 --> 29:20.320
with Elaine and the children,
before she died.

29:20.322 --> 29:22.082
In the war.

29:23.962 --> 29:26.642
I'm sorry. I never imagined
that was how she was lost.

29:30.522 --> 29:32.000
Where was she?

29:32.002 --> 29:34.240
Australia.

29:34.242 --> 29:35.600
Oh.

29:35.602 --> 29:37.280
I was stationed in Darwin.

29:37.282 --> 29:40.162
I thought Elaine and the children
would be safe with me.

29:41.722 --> 29:43.800
We were on high alert
after Pearl Harbor,

29:43.802 --> 29:46.002
but no-one truly believed
an attack on home soil.

29:49.242 --> 29:50.920
I was walking across the street.

29:50.922 --> 29:53.760
Elaine was on the other side.

29:53.762 --> 29:55.562
You saw it happen?

29:58.082 --> 29:59.920
When the first bombs hit,

29:59.922 --> 30:03.442
she started to run towards the hotel
where the children were.

30:06.242 --> 30:08.722
She was there one moment,
and the next...

30:11.682 --> 30:13.362
I ran towards her, but...

30:19.122 --> 30:20.922
She was a wonderful woman.

30:21.882 --> 30:23.562
I miss her.

30:28.522 --> 30:31.362
I've not met anyone
I've admired in that way since.

30:33.522 --> 30:35.002
Until now.

31:04.778 --> 31:07.576
Gino! Our luck is changing!
Anna.

31:07.578 --> 31:09.576
Things couldn't be better.
What has my mother said?

31:09.578 --> 31:11.336
Nothing.

31:11.338 --> 31:14.776
Father and Sarah
are having a romantic picnic,

31:14.778 --> 31:16.976
and if he's seeing her
then he has to understand...

31:16.978 --> 31:18.816
Anna, Mamma knows.

31:18.818 --> 31:20.618
She knows. She guessed.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.258
She forced me to tell.

31:25.818 --> 31:27.418
She's forbidden me to see you.

31:30.658 --> 31:32.256
Didn't you tell her
we love each other?

31:32.258 --> 31:35.096
I told her we're in love, we're
engaged. She hates it, all of it.

31:35.098 --> 31:36.776
As soon as your nonna's better

31:36.778 --> 31:38.856
she's going to tell her
and your father.

31:38.858 --> 31:41.696
No, no, no, I have to talk to her.

31:41.698 --> 31:43.698
Anna, listen. Wait.

31:46.218 --> 31:47.698
Stay.

31:55.018 --> 31:56.698
Who knows what will happen?

32:21.018 --> 32:22.338
Here.

32:33.258 --> 32:35.778
We're from such different worlds.

32:37.938 --> 32:39.698
Yes, we are.

32:57.978 --> 33:00.258
Grandmother asked me
to check on Amy again.

33:04.218 --> 33:06.298
What are you doing?

33:08.858 --> 33:12.736
You think me monstrous for what
I said about your grandmother.

33:12.738 --> 33:14.418
Yes.

33:16.058 --> 33:21.138
With her, it's a family
dominated by an iron will.

33:22.378 --> 33:27.498
Without her, just look.

33:28.938 --> 33:32.816
Your father, so full of warmth.

33:32.818 --> 33:38.218
Anna able to marry for love
and not as some trade negotiation.

33:40.298 --> 33:41.818
You and I.

33:44.298 --> 33:47.938
Go on. What would we be
if she died?

33:50.818 --> 33:54.778
The other night,
when you made love to me...

33:56.378 --> 33:58.618
..was it on her orders?

34:02.338 --> 34:04.296
Was it?
Livvy.

34:04.298 --> 34:06.778
You want to know
what would be different if she died?

34:07.978 --> 34:11.335
I would know my husband
was making love to me

34:11.338 --> 34:13.297
of his own volition.

34:14.858 --> 34:18.295
And I'd know our child
was being born into a house

34:18.297 --> 34:21.818
where there was
some vague hope of love.

34:37.330 --> 34:39.447
My family was supposed to be
the easy part.

34:39.449 --> 34:40.608
Hm.

34:40.610 --> 34:43.047
She couldn't see it at all?

34:43.050 --> 34:44.409
No.

34:45.370 --> 34:47.608
What if she changed her mind?
She won't.

34:47.610 --> 34:50.007
She would, if my father agreed.

34:50.010 --> 34:52.888
A nice dream.

34:52.889 --> 34:55.888
If he's in love with Sarah,
how can he say no to us?

34:55.889 --> 34:57.728
But they're different.

34:57.730 --> 35:02.808
Well, he's rich, she's poor.
He's Christian, she's Jewish.

35:02.810 --> 35:06.130
It's all about class and religion,
just like us.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.608
I don't know.
I do.

35:09.610 --> 35:14.490
If he fights for her, he'll be
fighting for us without knowing it.

35:17.090 --> 35:18.970
I'll make it happen.

35:34.050 --> 35:36.088
Grandmother wants me
to keep an eye out for Amy,

35:36.090 --> 35:38.368
so I'll be dropping by
from time to time.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.688
Good.

35:39.690 --> 35:43.450
I'm a married man.
I heard you the first time.

35:46.530 --> 35:49.808
Good, then, is it? Being married?

35:49.810 --> 35:51.730
We're expecting a child.

35:53.610 --> 35:55.090
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:09.810 --> 36:11.608
I owe you an apology.

36:11.610 --> 36:13.608
I've spoken to Gino.

36:13.610 --> 36:15.608
Not here!
It's OK.

36:15.610 --> 36:17.410
We're alone, I've checked.

36:21.810 --> 36:26.688
It was wrong to keep it a secret,
and I am sorry for that.

36:26.690 --> 36:30.490
But I won't apologise
for how I feel.

36:31.890 --> 36:36.088
This is the ring that Gino gave me,
and this proves that we're engaged.

36:36.090 --> 36:38.808
Not in the eyes of your family.

36:38.810 --> 36:40.408
Not in my eyes.

36:40.410 --> 36:42.888
We're in love.

36:42.890 --> 36:44.968
What you want is impossible.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.088
Why?

36:46.090 --> 36:49.968
You must marry into your own church.

36:49.970 --> 36:54.048
You must marry a rich man
and live in a grand house.

36:54.050 --> 36:56.448
Gino will never be enough for you.
He will.

36:56.450 --> 36:57.968
He is.

36:57.970 --> 37:01.328
Would you change your whole life
for him?

37:01.330 --> 37:04.690
Would you change your home,
your religion?

37:07.410 --> 37:11.530
I would do anything
to be with him.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.408
You are too young to understand
what you are saying.

37:16.410 --> 37:18.888
I've always loved Gino. Always.

37:18.890 --> 37:22.528
Even when we were little
and playing together.

37:22.530 --> 37:24.408
What else is there to understand?

37:24.410 --> 37:26.888
I can't approve of
something so wrong.

37:26.890 --> 37:28.688
And what if my father approved?

37:28.690 --> 37:30.448
No.
What if he did?

37:30.450 --> 37:32.688
That will never happen.
But if it did.

37:32.690 --> 37:35.888
If I can convince him to accept us,
will you?

37:35.890 --> 37:38.968
You mean can I?

37:38.970 --> 37:41.730
After what you did.

37:49.610 --> 37:54.368
It would be an honour for any mother
to have such a daughter-in-law,

37:54.370 --> 37:57.688
even knowing of your sins,
but it will never happen.

37:57.690 --> 38:02.328
Anna... it cannot.

38:02.330 --> 38:04.328
So you would go against my father?

38:04.330 --> 38:06.770
This will only lead to heartbreak.

38:09.250 --> 38:12.490
I'm putting Gino's and my happiness
in your hands.

38:13.970 --> 38:17.408
And you can give this back
when you can give us your blessing,

38:17.410 --> 38:19.808
and I know you will.

38:19.810 --> 38:21.328
One day.

38:21.330 --> 38:26.410
Now, all I ask for is time
to make my father understand.

38:31.730 --> 38:34.370
A month, no more.

38:35.810 --> 38:38.850
And what you have in your drawer,
you will have no need for that.

38:39.810 --> 38:41.608
I promise.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.490
At least you show shame.

38:45.170 --> 38:47.090
One month.

38:59.330 --> 39:00.328
Oh.

39:00.330 --> 39:02.808
I wouldn't presume to intrude,
Mrs Bligh,

39:02.810 --> 39:07.248
but the ladies of the CWA
asked me to deliver these.

39:07.250 --> 39:08.248
Oh.

39:08.250 --> 39:10.328
Our thoughts and prayers
are with you.

39:10.330 --> 39:12.688
Thank you.

39:12.690 --> 39:14.888
I won't stop. You need your rest.

39:14.890 --> 39:17.010
I'll get my Alma
to put these in water.

39:17.970 --> 39:21.768
I knew it couldn't be anything
dreadfully serious.

39:21.770 --> 39:24.168
The way Mr Bligh was chatting
so cheerily to Sister Adams

39:24.170 --> 39:25.768
as they passed me.

39:25.770 --> 39:28.048
Sister Adams?

39:28.050 --> 39:29.048
Yesterday.

39:29.050 --> 39:31.048
Giving her a lift home, I presume.

39:31.050 --> 39:33.168
No doubt.

39:33.170 --> 39:34.290
Indeed.

39:35.410 --> 39:38.888
Yes, well, if it's up to the good
wishes of the town,

39:38.890 --> 39:40.890
you'll be back home in no time.

40:09.515 --> 40:10.515
Livvy!

40:11.882 --> 40:13.362
Come here.

40:16.802 --> 40:18.522
Nobody told me to do this.

40:31.482 --> 40:33.162
I love you.

40:34.122 --> 40:36.520
I hate seeing
what this is doing to you.

40:36.522 --> 40:40.082
We will get through this,
I promise.

41:04.002 --> 41:07.082
So, who's going to break the news
to Eve about the christening?

41:08.162 --> 41:09.842
Perhaps we both could.

41:11.962 --> 41:14.162
I'm sure she'll understand.

41:22.722 --> 41:24.240
I heard Doris invaded.

41:24.242 --> 41:25.880
Oh, she did.

41:25.882 --> 41:28.840
I'll make sure she doesn't
make it through next time.

41:28.842 --> 41:31.080
Oh, she's harmless enough.
Hm.

41:31.082 --> 41:34.360
Anything you need?
I'm fine.

41:34.362 --> 41:36.522
It's good to see you settling.

41:37.842 --> 41:40.720
Well, what sort of person
doesn't listen to their doctor?

41:40.722 --> 41:43.122
I can't imagine.

41:46.522 --> 41:48.520
Actually, Jack, there is.

41:48.522 --> 41:51.080
Something I need. Or someone.

41:51.082 --> 41:54.080
Would you be kind enough
to make a telephone call for me?

41:54.082 --> 41:55.562
Long distance.

42:12.682 --> 42:14.000
What's wrong?

42:14.002 --> 42:15.480
I don't care.

42:15.482 --> 42:16.522
What?

42:28.661 --> 43:14.027
