WEBVTT

00:11.140 --> 00:12.960
I think Brandon James
might be back.

00:12.970 --> 00:15.530
I th/h/(I may have a way
to tell ifhe ’5 really back.

00:15.540 --> 00:17.167
Look in the background.
That's Eli.

00:17.180 --> 00:19.102
What was Eli doing
at will's funeral?

00:19.110 --> 00:21.101
These are just
like the pictures
i saw out at the farm.

00:21.110 --> 00:23.408
You realize that
if Eli had these letters...
Then he's the killer.

00:23.420 --> 00:26.241
Maybe he's using
the pig farm as a hideout.
I'm dedicating

00:26.250 --> 00:27.945
this installment
of the morgue to Zoe Vaughn.

00:27.950 --> 00:30.953
What the heck? Stop...
Emma:
No matter where I ran,

00:30.960 --> 00:32.552
they fol/owed me. . .
The/”r voices...

00:32.560 --> 00:36.326
Miguel:
This playing
from that Noah kid is podcast?

00:36.330 --> 00:37.354
Okay, I'm here!

00:37.360 --> 00:39.123
(Screaming)
Emma:
Mr. Maddox!

00:39.130 --> 00:42.065
Maggie:
Emma and Audrey are
on their way to the James farm,

00:42.070 --> 00:43.992
and Emma won ’t
answer my calls.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.160
(Sirens blaring)

00:45.170 --> 00:46.137
We didn't do it!

00:46.140 --> 00:49.064
You're arresting her?
Emma!

00:54.550 --> 00:57.713
(Suspenseful music playing)

01:03.160 --> 01:07.153
Me and you!
It never gets old.

01:08.430 --> 01:10.352
We didn't do this.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.354
Are you listening to me?

01:13.630 --> 01:16.599
Whoa, hey!
Look out! Watch out!
Man in the road!

01:16.600 --> 01:19.797
(Tires squealing)

01:24.280 --> 01:26.202
(Both groan)

01:28.350 --> 01:29.772
(Coughs)

01:30.750 --> 01:33.617
(Groaning, coughing)

01:52.140 --> 01:53.437
(Grunts)
(Screams)

01:53.440 --> 01:55.533
(Groans)

01:58.180 --> 01:59.499
(Screams)

01:59.510 --> 02:02.638
Wait, where'd he go?
I don't know.
I don't know.

02:02.650 --> 02:04.914
Do you see him?
No.

02:11.190 --> 02:13.852
(Screaming)

02:22.570 --> 02:25.562
Those are the keys
to the handcuffs.

02:29.340 --> 02:30.876
Come on.

02:31.780 --> 02:33.304
Are you clear?
Yeah.

02:33.310 --> 02:34.299
Okay, come on.

02:34.310 --> 02:36.403
Come on, come on, come on.

02:38.180 --> 02:39.909
He's still out there.

02:41.650 --> 02:44.483
Emma! What...?

02:50.360 --> 02:54.865
Lang:
Its called ”
fo/ie aﬂo'eux
or ”the mao‘ness of two. ”

02:54.870 --> 02:56.667
Its a psychological
syndrome

02:56.670 --> 02:58.331
in which
one deranged person

02:58.340 --> 03:01.309
transmits a delusion
to another,

03:01.310 --> 03:02.538
creating a shared psychosis

03:02.540 --> 03:05.270
that's stronger than one
could've developed alone.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.374
The second person can help
push the first over the edge,

03:08.380 --> 03:09.972
and that can result
in a psychotic break.

03:09.980 --> 03:14.246
So, you really think Emma
and Audrey could be suffering
from this madness of two?

03:14.250 --> 03:17.344
Seeing the news
and the videos
they posted online,

03:17.360 --> 03:18.884
it suddenly all made sense.

03:18.890 --> 03:20.926
I believe they can't
move past their trauma,

03:20.930 --> 03:23.455
so they just keep
replaying it.

03:23.460 --> 03:26.725
They may not even be aware
of what they're doing.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.608
I'm gonna ask him
if we can use their landline.

03:38.610 --> 03:40.271
(Man speaking on TV)

03:40.280 --> 03:41.975
(Door dings)

03:42.720 --> 03:44.915
(Phone rings)

03:46.590 --> 03:49.639
Pep 'n zip,
how can I help you?

03:50.390 --> 03:52.255
Sorry, what?

03:52.730 --> 03:53.879
Uh, let me, uh...

03:53.890 --> 03:57.451
(Chuckles)
This is gonna
sound weird, but...

03:57.460 --> 03:59.849
Are either of you Emma?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.488
That's me.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.628
Here, it's for you.

04:07.940 --> 04:11.307
. Hello?
D/storteo' voice:
Oh,
you must feel hire a star.

04:11.310 --> 04:15.041
Everybody wants
a piece of you.
Look outside. Look.

04:20.550 --> 04:22.916
I know you let us
out of there for a reason.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.353
I want to keep playing.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.612
So, if you turn
yourselves in,

04:26.630 --> 04:27.779
or even get caught,

04:27.790 --> 04:31.499
I’m gonna gut
someone you love.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.855
Better start running.

04:37.970 --> 04:40.495
He followed us here.
I didn't see anyone outside.

04:40.510 --> 04:42.569
Man on TV:
This just in. Local teenagers

04:42.580 --> 04:44.639
Emma duva/l and Audrey Jensen

04:44.640 --> 04:47.302
are wanted for questioning
in conjunction

04:47.310 --> 04:48.538
with the mayors murder.

04:48.550 --> 04:52.941
Citizens are advised...
Come on, let's go.

04:54.850 --> 04:56.841
(Knocking on door)

05:07.530 --> 05:12.069
Oh, so you knock now?
I didn't_ want
to surprise you.

05:12.070 --> 05:14.937
Yeah, I might've stabbed you.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.077
I heard about your dad.
I'm really sorry.

05:20.080 --> 05:25.848
Where were you last night?
Why didn't you answer
any of my texts?

05:26.090 --> 05:29.981
I just couldn't go home,
and then my phone died.

05:29.990 --> 05:33.084
That's pretty
terrible timing, huh?

05:35.060 --> 05:39.599
Listen, did you see
that stuff that got
uploaded on the morgue?

05:39.600 --> 05:43.559
Yeah...
I couldn't avoid it.

05:43.570 --> 05:45.435
Audrey looks pretty bad.

05:45.440 --> 05:49.433
(Sighs) Look, stavo,
Emma and Audrey
did not kill my dad,

05:49.440 --> 05:50.668
or Jake,
or anybody else.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.875
Did you really watch it?
The one with Jake's body?

05:52.880 --> 05:58.614
'Cause that was really twisted.
I do not need this
from you right now, okay?

05:58.620 --> 06:03.489
Audrey was quick
to point a finger at me.
Maybe this is why.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.085
(Scoffs)
You're so wrong.

06:07.090 --> 06:09.888
Am I? How...?
How can you be so sure?

06:09.900 --> 06:14.121
Sometimes, the people
closest to you are the ones
who keep the biggest secrets.

06:14.130 --> 06:17.167
I think you should just go.
Brooke, come on!

06:17.170 --> 06:18.865
Just go!

06:22.710 --> 06:24.109
Okay.

06:37.190 --> 06:40.409
(Faint police radio chatter)

06:44.930 --> 06:46.693
We need a home base.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.827
The theater.
We can figure out
our next move there.

06:48.830 --> 06:52.766
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I'm gonna sneak around back.
Take the gun.

06:52.770 --> 06:55.864
You stay here
and keep watch.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.678
Hold on!
Shouldn't we ditch this?

06:58.680 --> 07:02.172
No, not yet.
What. . .?

07:10.760 --> 07:12.512
Thank god, Emma!

07:13.230 --> 07:16.882
It was horrible.
Ithought
that psycho had you.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.822
I thought maybe you...

07:19.830 --> 07:22.162
Where's Audrey?
She's outside.
She's fine.

07:22.170 --> 07:24.798
So, what happened?
(Sighs)

07:24.800 --> 07:27.803
He killed the deputy,
and then... and then
he set us free,

07:27.810 --> 07:30.165
and then he called
and he threatened
and he said that...

07:30.180 --> 07:33.729
If we get caught,
he's gonna kill
somebody else.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.875
So, what are we gonna do?
I don't know.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.872
We have to think of a plan.
Have you seen Eli lately?

07:39.890 --> 07:43.246
No, Tina's packed and gone,
and Eli never came back
last night.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.148
Oh, my god...

07:46.160 --> 07:51.120
Okay, we're thinking
about hiding out
in the movie theater.

07:51.530 --> 07:52.895
I gotta go.
The cops are everywhere.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.789
Hey, I'll meet you there.
We'll figure this out.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.893
Okay.
Okay?

08:22.860 --> 08:24.020
(Door closes)

08:24.030 --> 08:28.569
Emma: I'm so sorry.
Kieran: You don't have
to apologize.

08:28.570 --> 08:32.199
(Both speaking indistinctly)

08:36.180 --> 08:41.277
Audrey: Right now, come on!
Emma: We need to help
each other, right?

08:41.280 --> 08:43.077
Kieran: Right.

08:43.620 --> 08:47.215
What the hell, Eli?
don't "what the hell" me.
What did you say to the cops?

08:47.220 --> 08:50.087
I just came from the station.
They questioned me for,
like, three hours.

08:50.090 --> 08:52.149
Yeah, I told them the truth.
I think you're obsessed
with Emma.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.981
And I think they should
check you out.
That's funny.

08:54.990 --> 08:56.082
Also, found out you were

08:56.100 --> 08:57.749
in town last year,
in October.

08:57.760 --> 09:00.320
Why didn't you tell me?
I figured you were busy.

09:00.330 --> 09:03.925
Just heard lakewood
was nice in the fall.
Thought I'd pay a visit.

09:03.940 --> 09:06.033
Hey, just stay away
from Emma.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.702
Look, I'm not scared
of you, okay?

09:08.710 --> 09:13.579
And I'm gonna do
whatever I want.
Try and stop me.

09:16.580 --> 09:20.641
(Siren blaring faintly)

09:22.190 --> 09:24.283
(Whispers)
Come on.

09:29.560 --> 09:36.523
Man:
I know its just
a matter of time

09:37.970 --> 09:44.933
I know its just
a state of mind

09:48.250 --> 09:51.913
please be there.
Please be there. Bingo!

09:51.920 --> 09:53.911
Locked myself out once,
stashed a spare just in case.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.808
Wait, are you sure
that there's nobody in there?

09:55.820 --> 09:57.014
Yeah. There's no matinee.

09:57.020 --> 10:00.183
The place is empty
till five.
Okay.

10:00.830 --> 10:04.220
Man:
Local teenagers
Emma duva/l and Audrey Jensen

10:04.230 --> 10:06.221
are wanted
for guest/on/ng. . .
Brooke. . .

10:06.230 --> 10:09.063
in conjunction
with the mayors m...

10:09.070 --> 10:11.789
Your dad...
I'm so sorry.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.736
Yeah. It's just been
so much, you know?

10:17.810 --> 10:20.631
I know I don't have
to tell you that.

10:23.120 --> 10:27.568
He wasn't always
the best dad,
but he was...

10:28.790 --> 10:31.111
there, you know?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.279
This morning, I...

10:33.290 --> 10:37.829
I went into the kitchen...
To get some jurce,

10:37.830 --> 10:40.025
and Ijust realized...

10:40.030 --> 10:43.295
I mean, he always
made me juice.

10:46.140 --> 10:48.961
I'm just really
gonna miss him.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.330
And now,
Emma and Audrey...

10:52.340 --> 10:56.743
You know
it's not them, right?
Of course.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.240
Look...

10:59.050 --> 11:01.245
We're in this together.

11:04.860 --> 11:08.580
(Phone ringing)

11:11.030 --> 11:12.224
Uh, hello?

11:12.230 --> 11:14.198
Hey, Noah, it's me.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.690
Emma! You guys
are about to hit

11:15.700 --> 11:18.635
"ten most wanted" territory
if you don't watch out.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.335
What-what happened?

11:21.010 --> 11:22.136
It was terrible.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.767
Hey, look, have you...

11:23.780 --> 11:24.974
Have you talked to Brooke?

11:24.980 --> 11:27.835
Uh, she's right here.

11:29.620 --> 11:31.645
(Clears throat)
Hey.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.175
Hey. I...

11:34.390 --> 11:36.813
I'm so sorry
about your dad.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.685
Brooke, you have
to believe us.

11:38.690 --> 11:43.320
We didn't... we didn't do
what they're saying we did.

11:43.330 --> 11:46.390
By the time we got there,
it was too late.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.222
I know you didn't
kill him, Emma.

11:50.870 --> 11:51.939
You couldn't.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.396
(Sighs)
Where are you guys?

11:53.410 --> 11:56.004
We ’re at the mo vie theater.
We'll be right there.

11:56.010 --> 11:58.774
No. Hey, no!
Stay where you are, okay?

11:58.780 --> 12:00.338
Stay where you are, and...

12:00.350 --> 12:03.171
And we'll call you back
when we have a plan.

12:06.020 --> 12:09.148
They're at the theater.
They want us to stay here.

12:09.150 --> 12:12.313
And let them go
through all this alone?

12:13.090 --> 12:15.183
Hell no.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.089
Okay.

12:22.100 --> 12:26.662
(Grunts)
Okay. Okay, let's go.

12:27.770 --> 12:32.673
Actually, I'm gonna
need some pants.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

12:33.450 --> 12:36.408
You don't actually believe
that they uncuffed themselves

12:36.420 --> 12:38.980
and killed a deputy
with their bare hands?

12:38.980 --> 12:40.049
I get this isn't easy.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.813
My daughter could
be kidnapped,

12:41.820 --> 12:43.378
or worse, and you're
searching my house?

12:43.390 --> 12:46.382
It's pretty obvious
that she's not here!
I know that it's hard

12:46.390 --> 12:48.028
to suspect someone
that you love.

12:48.030 --> 12:50.726
I don't suspect her!
You do!

12:50.930 --> 12:53.728
Has she ever told you
about her nightmares?

12:53.730 --> 12:55.288
How-how do you know
about those?

12:55.300 --> 12:58.269
We found a journal last night,
Emma's handwriting.

12:58.270 --> 13:01.091
She wrote about the barn
where we found the mayor.

13:01.110 --> 13:03.203
She wrote about
killing her friends.

13:03.210 --> 13:04.802
Maybe she doesn't
even know it's real.

13:04.810 --> 13:08.849
Those are just dreams.
Emma is not a murderer!

13:08.850 --> 13:13.275
Right now,
she's the best lead
that I've got.

13:13.290 --> 13:16.088
Oh, my god...

13:27.470 --> 13:30.962
Noah”.
Hey, Audrey...

13:30.970 --> 13:32.232
Hey.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.437
Oh, god.
You look terrible.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.408
Let's get you cleaned up.

13:37.410 --> 13:38.399
Noah: Yeah.

13:38.410 --> 13:40.275
Hey.
Hey, Noah.

13:40.810 --> 13:43.847
You doing good, Noah?
Yeah. As good
as can be expected,

13:43.850 --> 13:48.014
given the whole "killer
on the loose" of it all.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.951
Hey.

13:52.220 --> 13:56.350
We're gonna get
through this... together.

13:57.830 --> 14:00.025
(Ringtone playing)

14:03.940 --> 14:05.498
It's him.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.469
(Sighs, clears throat)
What do you want?

14:08.470 --> 14:11.439
Distorted voice:
Mm, ifit Isn ’t
daddys little girl.

14:11.440 --> 14:13.806
I'm the one you should
be talking to, you bastard.

14:13.810 --> 14:17.871
So, the gang’s all there.
Whats the occasion?
Another funeral?

14:17.880 --> 14:21.111
Wow, you think you're
really funny, don't you?

14:21.120 --> 14:22.087
You're a coward,

14:22.090 --> 14:24.012
running around in the dark,
hiding behind a mask.

14:24.020 --> 14:27.285
Careful, Emma.
You don ’t want
to see my face.

14:27.290 --> 14:28.951
I'm at the movie theater.

14:28.960 --> 14:31.258
If you want me,
come and get me.

14:31.260 --> 14:32.329
Emma!

14:32.330 --> 14:35.458
Are you sure
that was a good idea?

14:35.870 --> 14:37.519
I'm done running.

14:40.410 --> 14:43.265
You know half of those
are fake, right?

14:43.280 --> 14:45.908
Yeah, well,
the other half are real.

14:46.110 --> 14:50.979
Man:
you ’re the only one
that can calm me down

14:51.820 --> 14:57.349
my head spins in circles
so I ’m dizzy now

14:57.360 --> 14:58.281
oh, what?

14:58.290 --> 15:01.828
All of this time,
I should ’ve figured it out

15:01.830 --> 15:04.390
Emma:
We need to guard the doors
and stay in touch.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.494
Here, take my phone.
Thanks.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.162
Free animal, free animal

15:10.170 --> 15:11.990
my heart
pitter-patters...

15:12.000 --> 15:15.037
you guys know that you
don't have to stay, right?

15:15.040 --> 15:19.204
This is on me.
you ’re the only one
that can calm me down

15:19.210 --> 15:22.247
free animal, free animal
we're with you.

15:22.250 --> 15:26.914
You ’re the only one
that can calm me down

15:34.260 --> 15:38.822
(sighs)
So... here we are.

15:38.830 --> 15:39.524
Here we are.

15:39.530 --> 15:42.397
All of us
holed up together
in one room...

15:42.400 --> 15:44.595
Trying to trap
the killer... I mean...

15:44.600 --> 15:47.865
I think this is it.
I think this is
the big finale.

15:47.870 --> 15:50.361
Noah, please don't go
all meta on me right now.

15:50.380 --> 15:53.008
I need you guarding
this door with me.
I'm just saying,

15:53.010 --> 15:57.071
if this were a movie, we'd
be at the unmasking stage.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.445
Well, if it's you,

15:58.450 --> 16:02.238
I will defend myself
with this little hook thing.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.387
You know it's not me.

16:03.390 --> 16:06.382
Of course, that's what
the killer would say.

16:06.390 --> 16:09.882
(Chuckles)
Okay, I'm sorry.
It's... it's not me.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.425
It's really not me.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.567
Nothing.

16:16.570 --> 16:17.867
What if he doesn't show?

16:17.870 --> 16:19.132
He likes to pull the strings,

16:19.140 --> 16:20.334
not dangle from them.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.103
He's gonna show.

16:23.040 --> 16:23.904
Okay.

16:23.910 --> 16:26.128
(Phone rings)

16:27.110 --> 16:28.304
Hey, is everything okay?

16:28.310 --> 16:31.245
Just checking in.
How's it going back there?

16:31.250 --> 16:34.219
It's quiet.
Same here.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.983
It's been a while, though.
Maybe he's not coming.

16:35.990 --> 16:38.288
No, no. That is exactly
what he wants us to think.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.418
He wants us to let
our guard down. I'm not
gonna let that happen.

16:41.430 --> 16:47.096
Me either. I'm right there
with you, no matter what.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.567
Okay.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.637
Okay, if-if Piper
had an accomplice,

16:55.640 --> 16:57.528
maybe that accomplice
found another accomplice.

16:57.540 --> 16:59.633
Maybe there are
two killers again,
working together.

16:59.650 --> 17:03.279
That really opens up
the possibilities,
if you think about it.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.214
Noah, that's
not comforting.
I'm just saying,

17:05.220 --> 17:09.213
I think we should just
be prepared for anything.

17:09.220 --> 17:11.211
(Banging)

17:17.060 --> 17:21.326
Are you just gonna stare at me,
or are you gonna let me in?

17:24.300 --> 17:25.961
And why do you have a hook?

17:25.970 --> 17:27.494
What are you doing here?

17:27.510 --> 17:30.365
Seriously?
You asked me to come.

17:30.380 --> 17:33.531
Wait, you did?
No, I did not.

17:33.550 --> 17:34.505
Really?

17:34.510 --> 17:37.399
Then what the hell is this?

17:41.220 --> 17:46.658
I... H didn't send that.
I did not send that text.

17:47.230 --> 17:50.188
Will you just let me in?
Don't let him in.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.155
Dude, what?

17:51.160 --> 17:52.696
We're trying
to lure the killer

17:52.700 --> 17:53.997
and you show up.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.319
I'm sorry.
This is a pretty classic

17:55.330 --> 17:57.594
"don't let him in"
situation, right?

17:57.600 --> 18:00.068
Are you buying this?

18:10.420 --> 18:14.311
(Girl screaming)
What the hell?

18:15.320 --> 18:19.086
Where'd that come from?
It's coming from
inside the auditorium.

18:19.090 --> 18:20.182
Hey, wait. Hang on.

18:20.190 --> 18:22.624
Somebody has to stay here
and watch the door.

18:22.630 --> 18:24.552
I'm gonna go
check it out. Okay?

18:24.560 --> 18:26.221
Okay.
I'll be right back.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.324
Why-why-why
would you say that?

18:31.570 --> 18:32.468
Great.

18:32.470 --> 18:34.734
(Girl screaming)

18:34.740 --> 18:37.538
Oh, my god. What is this?
Who put this on?

18:37.540 --> 18:39.735
You guys, this isn't
a movie. This is real.

18:39.750 --> 18:43.208
(Screaming)
It's coming from
the projection room.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.245
There must be
somebody up there.
How did they get in?

18:45.250 --> 18:47.275
I don't know.
(Screaming continues)

18:47.290 --> 18:51.283
Where's Audrey?
She's... she's in the back.
She's guarding the door.

18:51.290 --> 18:53.656
She shouldn't be alone,
not if he's in here with us.

18:53.660 --> 18:57.152
You wait here, together.
I'm gonna get Audrey.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.491
Oh, god.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.094
(Screaming)

19:01.600 --> 19:05.138
I can't even... _
Just something make It stop.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.534
Help me/

19:08.740 --> 19:10.731
Okay. Okay,
I'm gonna go turn it off.

19:10.740 --> 19:14.107
You guys stay here.
Okay.

19:15.710 --> 19:19.316
(Screaming continues faintly)

19:56.660 --> 20:01.108
What...? What...?
(Breathing heavily)

20:01.130 --> 20:01.710
Noah?

20:01.730 --> 20:05.291
I'm here,
in the dark, not alone.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.791
Emma will be right back.
Kieran and Audrey are safe.

20:07.800 --> 20:11.190
Everything's okay.
Stavo showing up
is just a fluke.

20:11.200 --> 20:15.432
And Eli... I'm sure
he's just misunderstood.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.876
(Creaking)
Wait, what? Shh! Listen.

20:18.880 --> 20:23.772
(Screams)
Noah:
No, no! Brooke! Brooke!

20:27.850 --> 20:29.488
No!

20:34.260 --> 20:35.386
Call the police, now!

20:35.390 --> 20:38.655
Emma, wait! Oh, god...

21:06.190 --> 21:08.249
Brooke, just stay with us.
It's okay, Brooke.

21:08.260 --> 21:09.921
You're gonna be okay.
(Siren blaring faintly)

21:09.930 --> 21:12.797
Oh, my god.
Did you call an ambulance?
It's on its way.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.756
The police are on their way,
too. You have to go.

21:14.770 --> 21:16.658
I am not leaving Brooke.
(Siren blaring faintly)

21:16.670 --> 21:19.264
Did you find Audrey?
No. She's not
in the back room.

21:19.270 --> 21:21.795
Wait, where'd she go?
I don't know.
The door was open.

21:21.810 --> 21:24.529
Maybe she left already.
Emma, you need to leave.

21:24.540 --> 21:27.737
(Man banging on door)
Sheriff's department! Open up!
It's the police.

21:27.750 --> 21:31.379
We have to let them in.
Open up!

21:31.580 --> 21:35.243
Emma, go. Go now.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.813
It's okay, Emma. Go.

21:41.630 --> 21:43.723
Okay, okay.

21:44.500 --> 21:47.253
I'm gonna see you later.

21:50.940 --> 21:53.431
Noah:
She's in there.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.840
Woman:
Single stab wound. Looks
like internal hemorrhaging.

22:04.850 --> 22:07.239
You're gonna be okay, Brooke.
You're almost there.
Sorry, hun.

22:07.250 --> 22:10.139
That's as far
as you can go.

22:13.430 --> 22:15.421
(Ringtone playing)

22:17.330 --> 22:19.594
Emma, we're at the hospital.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.919
Hey. How is she doing?

22:20.930 --> 22:24.388
They're saying it's critical.
She's gone into surgery.

22:25.170 --> 22:27.138
Oh, my god!

22:27.140 --> 22:29.199
Have you heard
from Audrey?

22:29.210 --> 22:31.906
No. No, I haven't
heard anything.

22:31.910 --> 22:34.401
I really screwed up, Kieran.

22:34.610 --> 22:36.407
I never should've
told him where we were.

22:36.410 --> 22:39.015
We couldn't have known
it would go down like that.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.373
Yeah, I...

22:40.390 --> 22:41.470
I just didn't think.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.617
I didn't think and I put
everybody in danger.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.554
(Voice breaking)
And now, Brooke and Audrey...

22:45.560 --> 22:48.449
Emma...
I don ’t know
what to do anymore.

22:48.460 --> 22:51.554
I mean...
Should I turn myself
in to the police?

22:51.560 --> 22:55.155
I don't know.
He told me that he would
kill somebody if I do that.

22:55.170 --> 22:59.561
Listen, it's not your fault.
None of it, okay?

22:59.570 --> 23:01.435
Just hold on.

23:02.170 --> 23:03.660
Okay.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.209
Okay.

23:10.380 --> 23:11.608
Hey.
(Clears throat)

23:11.620 --> 23:14.942
I heard Brooke's hurt.
Is she okay?

23:15.290 --> 23:17.144
Brooke's a survivor.
She's tough.

23:17.160 --> 23:21.449
Uh, last year, she was
trapped in a freezer
and
stabbed, so...

23:21.460 --> 23:22.984
This surgery's
gonna be a cakewalk.

23:22.990 --> 23:27.290
I should've stayed,
gotten in somehow.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.663
(Indistinct chatter)

24:03.170 --> 24:07.493
Um, you know,
maybe this isn't
the best time, but...

24:07.510 --> 24:11.162
But what?
It's not Emma and Audrey.
There's no way...

24:11.180 --> 24:14.672
I'm not gonna comment
on a case, but if you know
where they are, tell me now.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.648
Because, off the record,
there's a lot of evidence.

24:16.650 --> 24:20.108
Yeah, see,
that's just the thing.
There's too much evidence.

24:20.120 --> 24:23.647
But you already knew that.
Everything points their way,
but who else could it be?

24:23.660 --> 24:26.379
Can I see your phone, please?
Are you kidding me?

24:26.390 --> 24:29.587
I need
to show you something...
another suspect.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.249
Thank you.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.169
Okay... look.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.060
What is this?
Eli was in lakewood
last October,

24:43.070 --> 24:47.234
during the murders,
at the funeral of a victim
he didn't even know.

24:47.250 --> 24:49.707
Maybe he was there
to view his own handiwork.

24:49.710 --> 24:52.372
Maybe he knew Piper.

25:21.150 --> 25:23.345
(Faint police radio chatter)

25:32.420 --> 25:34.285
(Phone dings)

26:36.690 --> 26:39.056
(Bird wings fluttering)

26:41.730 --> 26:43.652
(Phone rings)

26:48.070 --> 26:50.288
Hey.
What's going on?
I got your text.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.530
He's got Audrey.
Jesus. Where are you?

26:52.540 --> 26:58.308
I can't tell you that.
I'm not gonna let anyone else
die because of me.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.374
Whatever you're doing,
you don't have to do it alone.

27:02.380 --> 27:05.645
No, I do.
I'm sorry, I do.

27:05.650 --> 27:07.470
(Phone beeps)

27:09.990 --> 27:13.653
This ends now...
With me.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.479
I love you.

27:18.500 --> 27:22.527
Wait, Emma!
I love you, too.

27:27.410 --> 27:33.007
I ’ve been waiting
a long time for this.
I can almost taste it.

27:33.010 --> 27:34.102
Then why are you hiding?

27:34.110 --> 27:36.271
I ’rn not hiding.
I ’rn sa voring. . .

27:36.280 --> 27:40.614
The ﬁnal destruction
of you, Emma duva/l,

27:40.620 --> 27:43.145
and all you love.

27:43.660 --> 27:45.309
Why did you bring me here?

27:45.320 --> 27:47.288
This Is where P/per grew up.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.712
This place forged her.

27:48.730 --> 27:50.550
Did you love Piper?

27:50.560 --> 27:52.050
Is that what this is about?

27:52.060 --> 27:53.152
Love...
(Scoffs)

27:53.160 --> 27:54.354
7'o k/l/ with someone,

27:54.370 --> 27:56.167
now thats a real bond
Isn ’t it?

27:56.170 --> 28:01.096
You know.
You k/l/ed with Audrey.
What did that feel l/ke?

28:01.110 --> 28:03.567
We had no choice.
We had to kill her.

28:03.580 --> 28:06.231
You thought k/l/ing her
made you safe?

28:06.240 --> 28:10.347
You 7/ never feel safe
aga/n, Emma. lVe ver.I

28:13.280 --> 28:17.114
Audrey? Audrey,
can you hear me?

28:18.390 --> 28:20.358
(Screams)

28:57.400 --> 29:00.824
Oh, my god, oh, my god!
Audrey! Hey, hey!

29:00.830 --> 29:05.096
Audrey! Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.438
Hey. Hey, stay with me.

29:12.440 --> 29:13.702
Emma!

29:13.710 --> 29:15.200
Emma!
Kieran!

29:15.210 --> 29:16.746
Wait. What are you
doing here?

29:16.750 --> 29:19.275
I got Noah to ping his phone,
and we saw you were out here.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.747
I got here as fast
as I could. You're cut!

29:20.750 --> 29:23.218
Are you okay?
(Stammering)
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.541
Audrey... she's-she's drugged,
or passed out, or something.

29:25.560 --> 29:30.179
I don't know.
We gotta get her
out of here. Hurry.

29:35.370 --> 29:36.792
Hey.

29:37.840 --> 29:40.229
Eli... Eli, what happened?

29:40.240 --> 29:41.889
I followed Kieran
from the hospital,

29:41.910 --> 29:44.231
and the second
i got in the building,

29:44.240 --> 29:47.129
he comes behind me
and stabs me!

29:47.150 --> 29:49.471
So, I played dead
and called the police

29:49.480 --> 29:51.175
and told_them
It was Kieran.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.171
What? I didn't stab you.

29:53.180 --> 29:56.388
Hey, stop! Stay back!
Emma, I could've run away!

29:56.390 --> 29:58.688
Okay? And I heard your voice
and I came to help you!

29:58.690 --> 30:00.817
Do not listen to this!
He probably stabbed himself!

30:00.830 --> 30:02.684
You think this is me?
I don't know what to think.

30:02.690 --> 30:07.252
Tell me...
tell me why you were
in lakewood last October.

30:07.270 --> 30:09.522
It was because
of Kieran! Okay?

30:09.530 --> 30:11.725
Listen to this.
He just twists everything!

30:11.740 --> 30:13.537
No, you remember
that girl in Atlanta

30:13.540 --> 30:15.701
that had the restraining
order against me?

30:15.710 --> 30:19.237
That was Kieran's fault.
He liked her, too,
and he lied to her mom!

30:19.240 --> 30:23.574
Sa-said I was posting
naked pictures of her
online, or something!

30:23.580 --> 30:26.276
Because you were!
you
were!

30:26.280 --> 30:30.341
That's why
i was in lakewood...
to get back at him!

30:30.350 --> 30:32.682
And that's why
i was at the funeral.

30:32.690 --> 30:35.250
And then, I saw
all you guys and...

30:35.260 --> 30:37.228
I-i couldn't do it!
I don't know!

30:37.230 --> 30:39.448
That's the truth!
That's all there is!

30:39.460 --> 30:40.449
He's working you.

30:40.470 --> 30:41.926
He was obsessed
with that girl

30:41.930 --> 30:43.522
and he's obsessed with you.

30:43.530 --> 30:46.795
He's the killer!
Son of a...

30:47.770 --> 30:49.761
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Emma...

30:49.770 --> 30:52.409
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
He was gonna stab you!

30:52.410 --> 30:54.878
I know, I know.
It's okay, it's okay.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.939
It's over.
Mm-hmm.

30:57.350 --> 31:01.775
It's over.
Audrey:
Where... where am I?

31:01.790 --> 31:03.883
Audrey! Audrey...

31:03.890 --> 31:05.812
Hey. What's happening?

31:05.820 --> 31:09.221
It's over.
I think it's over.

31:10.560 --> 31:11.879
We're calling the police.

31:11.900 --> 31:15.529
You will feel safe again,
Emma. You too, Audrey.

31:15.530 --> 31:18.966
What did you just say?
We're calling the police.

31:18.970 --> 31:22.906
No. No, not that. What...?

31:23.910 --> 31:25.730
Before that...

31:26.340 --> 31:28.399
You just said...

31:28.410 --> 31:30.799
I will feel safe again?

31:30.820 --> 31:34.517
He said something
just like that
on the phone.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.444
What?
The killer.

31:38.420 --> 31:39.512
The killer said,

31:39.520 --> 31:43.854
"you will never
feel safe again."

31:46.530 --> 31:50.364
(Gasps)
Oh, my god...

31:51.500 --> 31:53.730
Oh, my god, it's you.

31:55.370 --> 31:58.498
No... no, Kieran...

32:02.010 --> 32:03.773
Tell me that I'm wrong.

32:03.780 --> 32:09.309
(Breathing heavily)

32:10.050 --> 32:12.484
Audrey:
Kieran?

32:12.490 --> 32:14.549
(Sighs deeply)

32:15.630 --> 32:17.518
You're not wrong.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.958
Emma!

32:25.800 --> 32:29.566
You know... he probably
really liked you.

32:29.570 --> 32:30.730
You're a monster.

32:30.740 --> 32:32.674
And the best part is...

32:32.680 --> 32:37.049
You just told me
you love me.

32:37.050 --> 32:39.314
(Chains clanging)

32:40.520 --> 32:44.047
I did. Not now.

32:44.060 --> 32:47.552
Oh. Okay.

32:48.960 --> 32:52.828
Tell me, so you and Piper...
You're... what?

32:52.830 --> 32:56.027
We were together
before you and I even met.

32:56.530 --> 32:57.963
All it took...

32:57.970 --> 33:01.394
was your mother throwing
Piper out like trash

33:01.410 --> 33:03.037
and my dad
dumping me in Atlanta

33:03.040 --> 33:05.508
so he could party
on pain pills.

33:05.510 --> 33:08.502
It made me and Piper sick
to see them together.

33:08.510 --> 33:09.875
Okay! Okay, so all of this...

33:09.880 --> 33:14.044
For you, all of this
is all about some
messed up daddy issues?

33:14.050 --> 33:15.608
Really?
You're right.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.088
I should've definitely
seen someone about that.

33:18.090 --> 33:21.514
But Piper showed me
that killing people

33:21.530 --> 33:24.681
is way more fun
than therapy.

33:24.700 --> 33:25.894
So...

33:25.900 --> 33:30.519
I made the sheriff
and the medical examiner
look like idiots.

33:30.530 --> 33:34.762
We tortured them
with a killing spree
they could not stop!

33:34.770 --> 33:37.466
And the last kills
was gonna be my dad,

33:37.480 --> 33:40.779
and then you,
and then your mother.

33:41.480 --> 33:43.698
You were Piper's
last surprise.

33:43.710 --> 33:45.769
Surprise!

33:45.980 --> 33:50.019
Your boyfriend is banging
your crazy half-sister,

33:50.020 --> 33:52.079
and we're both
about to kill you!

33:52.090 --> 33:55.548
And then,
i showed up with a gun!

33:56.590 --> 33:58.387
Yes.

33:59.860 --> 34:01.657
And you killed...

34:02.800 --> 34:03.994
my Piper.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.627
Yes.

34:06.770 --> 34:09.534
Which is why
i tortured you, too.

34:09.540 --> 34:12.100
It's gonna look
like you lured me here

34:12.110 --> 34:13.668
as the last victim,

34:13.680 --> 34:16.171
except I turned
the tables on you

34:16.180 --> 34:18.000
and killed you both!

34:18.020 --> 34:20.739
Stopped the rampage!

34:21.520 --> 34:22.646
I'll be the new hero.

34:22.650 --> 34:25.949
No one is gonna
believe you,

34:25.960 --> 34:26.984
you psychopath!

34:26.990 --> 34:29.083
That'll be for me
to worry about.

34:29.090 --> 34:32.082
You'll be dead.
I don't think so!

34:32.600 --> 34:34.750
Run, Emma!
Get out of here! Go!
(Grunts)

34:34.770 --> 34:39.093
Hey! If you let me get away,
all of this will have
been for nothing!

34:39.100 --> 34:41.034
No!

34:45.940 --> 34:47.931
Emma!

34:47.950 --> 34:50.839
Emma, you're not
gonna win this!

34:50.850 --> 34:53.171
I've got Audrey!
(Grunts)

34:53.180 --> 34:57.549
You can make her death
easy or hard!

34:57.560 --> 35:00.779
You know, she's
probably already gone!

35:08.530 --> 35:09.622
You already lost, Emma.

35:09.630 --> 35:11.063
Don't give him
what he wants!

35:11.070 --> 35:13.038
Get out of here!

35:13.540 --> 35:16.703
Don't think I won't
end you right now!

35:16.710 --> 35:19.235
I'm done with you!
You're trash.

35:19.240 --> 35:22.676
Looks like
you're gonna need her
until you find me.

35:22.680 --> 35:23.772
Stop being stupid, Emma!

35:23.780 --> 35:26.840
If you go,
at least one of us lives!

35:32.720 --> 35:35.257
(Grunting)

35:42.000 --> 35:43.729
Emma...

35:46.270 --> 35:48.261
(Grunts)

35:56.510 --> 35:58.000
Emma...

35:59.220 --> 36:01.939
How does it feel
to be helpless?

36:02.520 --> 36:05.216
How does it feel
to be hunted?

36:08.590 --> 36:10.626
Wondering when
it's gonna end?

36:10.630 --> 36:12.257
(Grunts)

36:12.260 --> 36:14.728
(Groans)

36:15.830 --> 36:19.288
Okay... so, how are we
gonna end this game?

36:19.300 --> 36:22.804
Shoot him.
Shoot him, Emma!
He deserves it!

36:22.810 --> 36:24.698
Yeah, come on!
(Grunts)

36:24.710 --> 36:27.873
You're a killer.
Shoot me!

36:27.880 --> 36:29.848
Do it!

36:35.690 --> 36:36.748
(Grunts)

36:36.750 --> 36:41.210
I get to choose
how you're gonna die.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.291
And you're not.

36:53.140 --> 36:54.937
Not today.

36:55.340 --> 36:58.207
You're gonna rot
in prison...

36:58.210 --> 37:02.635
Because you lost
at your own sick game.

37:02.650 --> 37:04.777
(Banging on door)

37:04.780 --> 37:07.169
Miguel:
Sheriff's department!

37:14.360 --> 37:17.659
Woman:
easy on the eyes

37:17.660 --> 37:20.322
truth is
him a loaded gun

37:20.330 --> 37:23.959
you don ’t want to point
that thing around here

37:23.970 --> 37:27.736
make all of your
skeletons appear

37:27.740 --> 37:30.129
this is real life

37:30.140 --> 37:33.303
and you ’ve been
living ﬁctional

37:33.310 --> 37:36.302
I don ’t want to hurt
your heart, my dear

37:36.310 --> 37:40.644
but if] gotta cut you,
oh, I W/l/

37:40.650 --> 37:42.015
’cause I ’ve given you

37:42.020 --> 37:44.989
damn near every chance
to make it poss/b/e

37:44.990 --> 37:50.326
have it all, but all you do
Is buﬂd a wall of fears

37:50.330 --> 37:53.697
and drown us
/n your tears

37:53.700 --> 37:57.261
but I pray for ya

37:57.270 --> 38:01.138
pray for ya

38:01.140 --> 38:03.267
I pray

38:03.270 --> 38:06.239
I pray, yeah

38:06.240 --> 38:09.129
when all this pain
Is gone

38:09.150 --> 38:12.301
when all
this blood has run

38:12.320 --> 38:16.279
when my heart’s
an empty gun

38:16.290 --> 38:19.851
I pray

38:21.630 --> 38:24.087
Noah:
Well, its oﬁ‘ia'al.
Three months later,

38:24.090 --> 38:28.823
and lakewood has survived
another mass murderer.

38:28.830 --> 38:32.596
It turns out Piper
did have an accomplice.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.569
Go figure!
I was right all along.

38:35.570 --> 38:38.733
But none of us saw
this killer coming,

38:38.740 --> 38:41.971
and believe me,
it cuts deep.

38:42.180 --> 38:44.148
Alter a betrayal l/ke that:

38:44.150 --> 38:46.846
can you ever really
learn to trust again?

38:46.850 --> 38:50.217
Miguel: Well, I have to admit
i did watch a couple episodes.

38:50.220 --> 38:53.587
Stavo: Yeah,
he watched five episodes.
At which point, he...

38:53.590 --> 38:55.182
Maybe the best way
to move forward

38:55.190 --> 39:00.196
Is to put it all
behind us, if we can.

39:03.870 --> 39:07.590
Brandon James,
P/per Shaw,

39:07.610 --> 39:09.237
Kieran W/lcoX...

39:09.240 --> 39:10.639
All wanted revenge,

39:10.640 --> 39:14.007
and maybe thats
the end of the chain.

39:14.010 --> 39:14.829
Thanks.

39:14.850 --> 39:18.479
Magic mix?
Absolutely.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.888
Maybe this was
the last dangling thread.

39:23.890 --> 39:27.485
Maybe there are
no more to pull.

39:27.760 --> 39:31.685
Maybe things really
are back to normal.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.498
Your lavwer's calling.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.976
Why?

39:56.750 --> 40:02.859
Or maybe, lakewood
you 7/ always be murderwl/e.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.921
Only time wﬂl tell.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.693
Distorted voice:
Hello, Kieran.

40:07.700 --> 40:10.897
Who told you
you could wear my mask?
