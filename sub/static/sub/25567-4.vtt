00:22.689 --> 00:23.815
Ungrateful bastards!

00:24.691 --> 00:25.525
Whatever.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.902
There will be lots
of people at this party.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.447
If I want to get a job,
I can't hide here, right?

00:30.530 --> 00:33.116
-Marcinho said I have to go out.
-Get out!

00:33.199 --> 00:36.661
He said if I'm not playing
then why not get a job off the pitch?

00:36.745 --> 00:39.914
-A broadcaster or commentator...
-I'm using the bathroom!

00:39.998 --> 00:42.709
He told us to arrive as a couple,
because couples sell.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.794
Are you going like that? It's almost ten!

00:44.878 --> 00:48.423
If I'm using the bathroom,
you can't come in! Do you understand?

00:48.757 --> 00:50.508
Couples use the bathroom together.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.386
-Nobody's shit smells nice.
-I didn't make myself clear.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.973
-I'm not going to this party!
-Samantha, you promised me!

00:57.057 --> 00:59.768
-I can't handle this TV stuff.
-You can handle a party.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.021
-Damn, are we together or not?
-We are, my dear, but we're not.

01:03.104 --> 01:06.691
Speaking of that, you can sleep
with the first bimbo you see, OK?

01:06.775 --> 01:09.360
Then you'll stop being needy
and leave me alone.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.155
Relax, I'll dress nicely
for the bimbos, OK?

01:12.238 --> 01:14.616
See if you can get one
with a spare room, Dodoi!

01:14.699 --> 01:16.910
Just one, Samantha? You don't know me!

01:18.870 --> 01:22.707
Dodoi, I'm not going to any damn party,
especially after this circus here!

01:23.208 --> 01:27.086
They didn't even take a good picture
of me getting kicked off that lousy show.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.006
I can't go to the party anyway,
did you forget?

01:30.507 --> 01:31.716
I'm in Paris!

01:33.468 --> 01:35.470
-Where?
-I went to Paris...

01:35.553 --> 01:37.180
and I'll be back next week!

01:46.231 --> 01:49.192
<i>"I'm in Paris."</i>
<i>Never heard that one before.</i>

01:49.984 --> 01:53.780
-Hey, Dodoi! Notice me! Come here!
-You're so hot!

02:03.331 --> 02:06.751
<i>Bonjour, Plimploms. I just woke up, guys.</i>

02:07.877 --> 02:09.753
<i>I'm here having my cup of coffee,</i>

02:09.838 --> 02:12.549
<i>eating my typical Parisian croissant.</i>

02:13.758 --> 02:15.885
<i>Delicious! Mine is ham and cheese.</i>

02:16.553 --> 02:17.637
<i>I have to tell you</i>

02:17.971 --> 02:20.849
<i>it's like I was born to be here,</i>
<i>in this amazing city, guys.</i>

02:21.057 --> 02:24.144
<i>I don't have time for the evil gossip</i>
<i>of jealous haters.</i>

02:24.352 --> 02:26.855
<i>Everywhere I look, I see beautiful things!</i>

02:27.564 --> 02:28.773
<i>By the way...</i>

02:28.857 --> 02:33.153
I want to thank Frizzon Optics
for these gorgeous sunglasses.

02:33.611 --> 02:36.197
I have to go, my loves.
It's very chilly here!

02:37.740 --> 02:39.325
Cindy, what are you laughing at?

02:39.701 --> 02:40.910
How does it look, son?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.662
This time it didn't burn.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.455
No, love. I mean the video.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.375
I have to use this trip to Paris
to grow my Instagram.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.460
And reach, maybe, at least 200k.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.629
So I don't depend as much on TV.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.716
What are you laughing at? Look, Cindy!

02:54.799 --> 02:58.136
You should have come to Paris with me.
You were kicked off the show too.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.055
Mom, I'm laughing at Laila.
She's so funny.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.474
Did you know she went to Paris
twice this month?

03:03.558 --> 03:05.518
-Twice?
-I'd go to Paris with her.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.478
As if she'd go with you.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.105
That's your problem, Cindy.

03:09.188 --> 03:13.443
I know lots of people in that city,
my real friends.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.361
Like Gretchen, like Neymar!

03:15.445 --> 03:17.530
I'm childhood friends with Jordi.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.781
She's so humble.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.075
She just said she farts
when she eats bread.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.577
She announces when she farts?

03:22.660 --> 03:25.580
You and Laila have nothing in common, Mom.
She's different.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.750
What do you mean "different", Brandon?
Come here, Cindy.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.376
Let me see this girl's face!

03:30.460 --> 03:32.503
So much talk about this girl!

03:34.130 --> 03:35.715
Four million followers?

03:36.758 --> 03:37.842
Namibia.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.886
Australia?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.096
Germany?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.057
What is this girl? A flight attendant?

03:49.812 --> 03:51.564
I recognize that bathtub!

04:15.672 --> 04:18.341
<i>Baby, will you bring me a towel?</i>

04:18.800 --> 04:19.841
Fucking hell!

04:31.980 --> 04:34.649
Morning! How is Paris?

04:34.732 --> 04:38.361
Just great! It's very nice, actually.
I feel really at home.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.780
-Do you need the bathroom?
-I've got a headache.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.448
A shower might help.

04:42.532 --> 04:46.619
I know how it is. You look good
for someone who was afraid to party.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.497
It was a business occasion.
I was there to network.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.834
Network, sure.
Well, I'm going to pee real quick.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.712
I don't want an emergency
in the line for the Eiffel Tower.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.465
Can't you use the guest bathroom?

04:59.549 --> 05:03.177
<i>I'm cold, baby!</i>
<i>My body fat is like half a percent.</i>

05:03.261 --> 05:05.555
Did you teach the tub to talk, Dodoi?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.557
Or is this part of your networking?

05:07.640 --> 05:10.643
It's a funny story, you won't believe it!

05:10.727 --> 05:13.062
I'm sure I won't believe it!

05:14.105 --> 05:16.858
You scared me! Samantha!

05:16.941 --> 05:18.609
This is embarrassing, sorry!

05:19.652 --> 05:21.154
Laila. It's my pleasure.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.700
Where are the kids? I'd love to meet them!

05:25.783 --> 05:29.412
-Who's that in my bathtub?
-Well, she's the first bimbo I saw.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.291
And the line was long.
You probably forgot, right, Samantha?

05:33.374 --> 05:36.586
When you're famous, people gather around,
wanting attention.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.212
What's this to do with you?

05:38.713 --> 05:41.966
Mom! Laila just posted a photo
shaving with your razor!

05:42.050 --> 05:44.886
Adults are talking, Cindy!
Excuse us, excuse me!

05:45.178 --> 05:46.888
And no more banging doors, OK?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.481
<i>I think help has arrived, guys!</i>

05:57.148 --> 05:58.816
<i>Do you guys see this?</i>

05:58.900 --> 06:01.360
<i>Look at this cutie!</i>

06:01.444 --> 06:02.945
<i>I feel like Angelina.</i>

06:03.029 --> 06:06.032
<i>Is she here to answer</i>
<i>my hashtag "a towel for Laila"?</i>

06:06.532 --> 06:08.076
Caught you in your pajamas?

06:10.870 --> 06:11.746
No.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.372
Crazy girl!

06:13.456 --> 06:17.627
<i>I think I got my towel, babies!</i>
<i>What else will I find in this house?</i>

06:19.128 --> 06:21.672
<i>I wanted to thank</i>
<i>the members of the Academy,</i>

06:21.756 --> 06:24.133
<i>my dear Samantha, my father,</i>
<i>and my sister,</i>

06:24.217 --> 06:27.470
<i>who unfortunately couldn't be here</i>
<i>as I only had two invitations.</i>

06:27.553 --> 06:29.889
Kids are cute even when they're sad.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.352
This is Laila, my personal friend.
I'm going to lend her some clothes.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.188
I don't repeat outfits.
And your dad vomited on my dress.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.735
Are you dad's girlfriend?

06:43.194 --> 06:46.239
-We're getting to know each other.
-I love it when you say that!

06:46.739 --> 06:48.366
Do you want a little brother?

06:48.449 --> 06:52.120
I'm joking, silly!
Actually, by law, I can't get pregnant.

06:52.203 --> 06:55.414
I'm injecting shark hormones for my hair.
What's your Instagram?

06:55.498 --> 06:59.335
@Brandon_Real_Official.
Will you follow me?

06:59.418 --> 07:02.004
Obviously not!
I tagged you in the Oscars video!

07:02.088 --> 07:04.549
You two are so cute!
I already feel attached to you.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.134
Imagine a picture of us?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.718
Hashtag "heart family"!

07:09.846 --> 07:11.013
Only pictures of me.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.724
Take whatever you want. Feel free!

07:14.350 --> 07:15.977
Do you have any clean ones?

07:16.310 --> 07:19.522
-Where is she?
-You scared her off with your jealousy.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.858
Jealousy, Dodoi?
You don't even know her name!

07:21.941 --> 07:23.443
-It's Sheila!
-Hello!

07:23.526 --> 07:24.819
-Here's Sheila!
-It's Laila.

07:24.902 --> 07:27.447
-Look, Laila.
-Sorry, I came straight from the party.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.741
But Cindy was cute and lent me
this shirt. Hashtag "gratitude".

07:31.284 --> 07:34.203
Dodoi, your girlfriend fits in
your daughter's clothes.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.997
I know. And she looks hot, right?

07:36.497 --> 07:38.958
Samantha, I love that this is
a museum of your life.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.668
It's just what fits on the walls.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.254
It seems like you died
at your peak, super chic.

07:43.337 --> 07:46.382
My mom was a huge fan
when you were famous!

07:46.466 --> 07:48.342
If I don't get a photo, she'll kill me!

07:48.426 --> 07:50.011
-Let me take the picture!
-Yeah?

07:50.094 --> 07:52.305
-It's for her mom, Samantha.
-It's for my mom.

07:52.388 --> 07:55.224
-No photos!
-No, I'll put a filter on you, honey.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.517
No! She's in Montmartre!

07:56.601 --> 08:01.063
Is it contagious? I used your bathtub!
I used your razor. And your toothbrush!

08:02.064 --> 08:03.149
I love your family.

08:03.232 --> 08:07.361
Colorful, cheerful, full of minorities.
It would make a beautiful post!

08:07.445 --> 08:11.115
If you want to help with those
party contacts, I know everyone, OK?

08:23.002 --> 08:25.087
-Call me, OK?
-No, Laila, stay.

08:25.421 --> 08:26.339
What?

08:26.422 --> 08:29.509
Stay a little. Samantha would love
some tips on Paris, you know?

08:29.592 --> 08:32.053
You're going to Paris?
Winter is fattening!

08:32.135 --> 08:34.889
-What a good tip, Samantha!
-No, guys, I can't stay!

08:34.972 --> 08:38.768
-Imagine! It's crazy! I'm not family.
-Of course you are. You're not a burden!

08:38.851 --> 08:41.729
-The kids would love it!
-She's always welcome, right?

08:45.024 --> 08:48.736
Make yourself at home, Laila.
No problem, make yourself comfortable.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.363
By the way,

08:50.446 --> 08:53.866
I'm going out for a while,
but I'll be right back.

08:53.950 --> 08:58.204
I know what you're thinking,
that I killed animals to make this coat.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.456
No, I'm thinking it's a little hot.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.792
They were already dead.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.628
Just kidding, silly!

09:05.962 --> 09:08.965
Brandon, get the bike,
we're going to Versailles.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.633
There's a bakery near here.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.688
Mom, you can't leave.
There are paparazzi out there.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.273
No, you're in Paris!

09:25.356 --> 09:28.025
But if I'm in Paris,
why are there paparazzi outside?

09:28.109 --> 09:30.486
They didn't come because of you.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.538
I won't let this girl ruin my trip.

09:40.621 --> 09:44.208
All right, Brandon. Let's choose
another place to make the video.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.378
Brandon? Brandon!

09:57.847 --> 10:01.601
When I saw you at the party, I thought
you were just another soccer player

10:01.684 --> 10:03.144
on my Instagram stories.

10:03.853 --> 10:07.023
But now I look at you
and I see a real father.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.942
You have matured so much since yesterday.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.528
I'm still learning this dad business.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.655
Samantha does almost everything.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.158
I think your relationship is so civilized.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.037
Once I bumped into my ex-boyfriend
in the street, he threw poop in my hair.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.165
Then he screamed,
"You murderer! You killed my cat!"

10:25.082 --> 10:26.626
But did you kill his cat?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.378
I helped the cat to move on.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.591
Focus, Samantha. Focus! Project Paris.
Leave Dodoi and that girl in Brazil.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.217
How's my Instagram?

10:35.968 --> 10:39.263
-Another 70 followers.
-Only 70, honey?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.265
So I'm not sightseeing enough.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.935
If that girl got four million followers
just by travelling,

10:45.019 --> 10:48.147
a woman like me can have 300,000
by the end of the day.

10:48.439 --> 10:52.401
You think when we're a bit more intimate
I can give Samantha a gift?

10:52.943 --> 10:55.863
I don't know.
It's better not to mix things up.

10:55.946 --> 10:59.408
I'd like to change that armchair,
but I don't want to be rude.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.035
Did you see that coat?

11:01.994 --> 11:04.872
"The animals were already dead."

11:05.581 --> 11:08.292
"Winter is fattening." How rude.

11:08.793 --> 11:09.919
What about the Louvre?

11:10.002 --> 11:13.047
Mom, for three hours
you've only been posting paintings.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.509
Only Dodoi can make me this mad
while I'm on vacation in Paris.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.554
Mom, forget it, what if you went to a spa?

11:20.638 --> 11:25.226
Honey, no. I need something
more important, I don't know, an event.

11:25.309 --> 11:28.062
<i>It was a multicolored disc</i>

11:28.145 --> 11:29.188
Hey, look.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.112
Go, go, faster! Go, go! Thanks, darlings.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.531
Can I take it?
One, two, three, I'm answering.

11:38.614 --> 11:40.116
Hi, my love!

11:40.199 --> 11:44.120
<i>Honey, I can't believe you're in Paris</i>
<i>and you didn't tell me!</i>

11:44.203 --> 11:45.913
<i>Where are you staying?</i>

11:46.205 --> 11:48.791
In a hotel here called Bon... Bon Vivant.

11:48.874 --> 11:53.045
<i>Are you avoiding me? Now everyone is</i>
<i>talking about you because of "Caged".</i>

11:53.129 --> 11:55.131
<i>You don't have time for your friend?</i>

11:55.214 --> 11:57.633
No way, love. I was going to...

11:57.716 --> 12:01.137
<i>I'll pick you up right now!</i>
<i>There's a huge party, with chic people.</i>

12:01.220 --> 12:04.890
<i>Open bar, champagne, the whole of Monaco,</i>

12:04.974 --> 12:06.767
<i>and free croissants.</i>

12:06.851 --> 12:09.937
I would really love to go, but I'm busy.

12:10.020 --> 12:14.150
<i>Please! Send me your location.</i>
<i>I'll pick you up right now.</i>

12:14.233 --> 12:16.193
I already said I can't and it's true.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.570
<i>I get it!</i>

12:18.404 --> 12:22.324
<i>You ashamed of your three-star hotel?</i>
<i>Don't worry, I've been there too.</i>

12:22.408 --> 12:24.034
I knew this would be a lot of work.

12:24.118 --> 12:28.831
I'm at work. I'm in a super new project,
but I can't talk about it yet.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.542
If I get a break,
I promise I'll tell you, OK?

12:31.625 --> 12:34.962
<i>-What are you doing? Come on, tell me!</i>
-Speak to you later, love.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.715
<i>-Samantha, let's talk more!</i>
-We'll talk later, bye!

12:38.382 --> 12:41.302
I knew she wouldn't keep it a secret.
Think she noticed?

12:42.636 --> 12:45.055
I think I'm going to have
to shorten my trip.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.900
-There's a photographer out there again.
-I know, I called him.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.444
Another picture?

12:58.527 --> 13:01.989
This is for hashtag "love sees no color",
against racism.

13:02.072 --> 13:06.869
I'm keeping your identity a secret.
But you're already a big hit!

13:06.952 --> 13:09.371
20,000 people already liked
your rock hard booty.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.165
Did you take a picture of my ass?

13:11.248 --> 13:13.292
You know what I think would explode?

13:13.792 --> 13:15.669
A family photo!

13:15.753 --> 13:18.214
Can I take your kids to Disneyworld
or is it too early?

13:18.297 --> 13:20.299
I want to do everything at the right time.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.765
Laila, we need to talk.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.309
Hey.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.395
You can say whatever you want to me.

13:33.896 --> 13:36.106
I know we're thinking the same thing.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.526
I accept.

13:39.944 --> 13:43.489
<i>Airports are closed. Streets are blocked.</i>

13:43.822 --> 13:45.282
<i>The electricity has gone out.</i>

13:45.366 --> 13:49.578
<i>This is a summary of the biggest blizzard</i>
<i>in the last 30 years in Paris.</i>

13:49.662 --> 13:51.205
Hashtag "I knew it".

13:51.288 --> 13:53.123
<i>People are completely terrified.</i>

13:53.374 --> 13:56.502
OK, we're stuck in Paris.
This is not a problem!

13:56.585 --> 13:59.630
We can find some snow.
How's Instagram looking?

14:00.714 --> 14:04.593
I've got a bunch of new followers.
They found out I'm friends with Laila.

14:04.677 --> 14:08.138
I'm talking about my Instagram, Brandon!
Focus here, please.

14:08.222 --> 14:13.435
Guys! I've got 5,000 followers.
Everyone is tagging me in this post, why?

14:16.313 --> 14:18.857
They're going to shoot
a soap opera here in Paris.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.569
People think that's why you came.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.997
Leave me alone, Dodoi. I didn't overcome
candidiasis to be treated this way.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.667
I knew this was an abusive relationship
when you didn't remember my name!

14:45.843 --> 14:49.054
<i>Sweethearts, you won't believe</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:51.056
<i>My mom got hit by a car.</i>

14:51.265 --> 14:54.310
<i>No, I'm joking,</i>
<i>but it was just as horrible.</i>

14:54.935 --> 14:59.189
<i>I was deceived by someone</i>
<i>I thought was the love of my life.</i>

14:59.273 --> 15:02.151
<i>One moment we're planning to spend</i>
<i>New Year's in Trancoso,</i>

15:02.234 --> 15:05.529
<i>the next moment he throws me away</i>
<i>like I'm an old 30-year-old woman.</i>

15:05.613 --> 15:09.408
<i>He's not even my type.</i>
<i>I like players who still score goals!</i>

15:09.491 --> 15:11.577
<i>I could have been a mom to his children.</i>

15:12.620 --> 15:17.082
<i>This is the subject of this week's video.</i>
<i>Hashtag "How could he fool me".</i>

15:17.166 --> 15:20.336
<i>The best story wins two sessions</i>
<i>of cryolipolysis.</i>

15:20.419 --> 15:24.256
<i>Girls, let's empower ourselves.</i>
<i>Hashtag "girl power".</i>

15:24.340 --> 15:26.675
Tell me what you know
about the soap opera.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.638
<i>You used to be more humble. Now you</i>
<i>disrespect those who've helped you.</i>

15:30.721 --> 15:33.223
I'm sorry!
I was in the middle of a meeting.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.184
But now we can gossip as much as we want.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.312
<i>All right. We can't fight,</i>
<i>especially if you're on TV, right?</i>

15:38.938 --> 15:41.065
<i>Are you preparing for the role?</i>

15:41.148 --> 15:45.986
Sure! Of course! I want to add
a more modern, current style.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.613
<i>For the French Revolution?</i>

15:48.530 --> 15:50.866
Precisely. Ancient France.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.578
The subject always needs a revamp,
don't you think?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.956
But tell me, what else do you know?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.457
<i>I'll tell you everything!</i>

16:05.130 --> 16:06.131
Dodoi!

16:06.840 --> 16:09.301
Don't you have a friend
who was beheaded in prison?

16:09.385 --> 16:11.637
I'm looking for references for a job.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.639
Samantha, you were right.

16:14.765 --> 16:15.683
What?

16:16.392 --> 16:17.726
Say that again.

16:18.060 --> 16:22.189
-That girl over there. That...
-Laila. Yes, go on.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.024
We need to make her leave.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.110
-"We", Dodoi?
-"We" do!

16:26.193 --> 16:29.029
If you'd come with me,
I wouldn't have met her.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.698
I'm working, my dear. OK?

16:30.781 --> 16:33.742
I'm looking for some references
in the kids' history books.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.704
Because you can't trust the internet
these days, right?

16:36.787 --> 16:40.332
According to rumors, I am part
of the first Brazilian soap opera

16:40.416 --> 16:43.210
on the French Revolution.
You know who you're talking to?

16:43.293 --> 16:44.461
Who am I talking to?

16:44.545 --> 16:48.966
The apparent star of <i>Passion and</i>
<i>Revolution 2: The Fall of the Bastille.</i>

16:49.049 --> 16:51.218
-A soap opera?
-They're only rumors, Dodoi.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.095
That I'm going to turn into reality.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.849
<i>-People...</i>
-Look. That's what I'm talking about.

16:56.932 --> 17:00.310
<i>...let's not give in to men</i>
<i>who don't respect us.</i>

17:00.394 --> 17:03.939
<i>Laila, look at your power. Be happy, sis!</i>

17:04.022 --> 17:07.984
<i>Babes, you know I always support</i>
<i>an anti-toxic-man campaign.</i>

17:08.068 --> 17:10.362
<i>Stay strong, and girl power!</i>

17:11.405 --> 17:12.656
I'm leaving.

17:13.281 --> 17:17.036
That's fine, then. We'll talk, darling.

17:17.618 --> 17:20.664
Samantha, thank you so much
for everything.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.209
Want some advice, girl?
You should leave too.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.420
You can go. You can go ahead, OK?

17:26.502 --> 17:28.922
I should expose the truth
about this family!

17:29.006 --> 17:31.467
-Stay, girl!
-Weren't you busy?

17:31.550 --> 17:35.179
Super busy. Working. Spreading news.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.765
But I think I have
a lot to learn from Laila.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.899
-Thanks!
-Come here.

17:54.406 --> 17:58.744
I can't believe you know her!
We've even gone to war on Twitter once.

17:58.994 --> 18:02.164
-We did a commercial.
-For that intimate soap, Fungicide?

18:02.956 --> 18:03.791
No.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.211
OK. I was invited to do that one too.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.297
-What a small world, right?
-Yeah.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.467
Samantha, I'm so happy
with our friendship!

18:13.967 --> 18:16.845
I have the hardest time
making relationships last long.

18:16.929 --> 18:22.434
I totally get you, Laila. It's hard
for successful women like us, right?

18:22.518 --> 18:25.312
-Everyone likes to talk.
-Everyone wants to take advantage.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.358
Thanks.

18:29.733 --> 18:33.904
This is the most comfortable armchair
in the entire universe!

18:34.780 --> 18:37.825
-You think they're OK in there?
-Define "OK".

18:39.118 --> 18:43.831
So it's true? I always thought that story
about knives inside the doll was a rumor.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.292
With the internet,
there's no more fuss about true or false.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.629
Occasionally people make stuff up
that I wish were true.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.840
They said I took part in an animal orgy.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.216
I wasn't even invited.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.177
In the end, I signed a deal
with a pet food brand.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.680
Girlfriend, tell me,
how did you really get famous?

18:59.763 --> 19:01.974
Did you take part in
that singing competition?

19:02.057 --> 19:03.100
I can't sing.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.811
-Are you an actress?
-I hate theater. So boring!

19:05.894 --> 19:09.231
But you have four million followers
on Instagram, don't you?

19:09.314 --> 19:12.276
Five million followers.
I'm a "digital influencer".

19:12.359 --> 19:15.654
-A what?
-A spiritual guide. Without the spiritual.

19:15.737 --> 19:19.158
Hold on, you're saying
you don't sing, don't dance,

19:19.241 --> 19:22.703
you're not an actress,
so you do absolutely nothing?

19:24.872 --> 19:28.458
For example, if I say
that food poisoning makes you thinner,

19:28.542 --> 19:31.003
in five seconds
everyone will drink toilet water,

19:31.086 --> 19:33.422
something I personally don't do anymore.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.257
The world's gone really crazy.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.967
But I try to use it only to do good.

19:37.050 --> 19:40.179
Like nature.
If I say that the cool thing now

19:40.262 --> 19:43.348
is to dye your hair green
to defend the Amazon rainforest,

19:43.432 --> 19:45.767
tomorrow everyone will have green hair.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.106
What are they talking about?
I thought they hated each other!

19:51.190 --> 19:55.903
Dad, as much as it hurts to say this,
as a feminist and cosmopolitan,

19:55.986 --> 19:58.780
I think there's no denying it,
they're bad-mouthing you.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.949
Nothing unites people like a common enemy.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.370
Think they will make a doll of me?

20:08.165 --> 20:09.666
They won't make a Laila doll?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.294
They only made dolls
of truly famous people.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.004
You don't think I'm truly famous?

20:14.087 --> 20:16.715
You are. Of course you are.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.801
But this internet business
is very fast, you know, Laila?

20:19.885 --> 20:22.846
When they make a Laila doll,
there'll be a new girl already.

20:22.930 --> 20:27.601
Back then, to be famous, you had
to have done something impressive,

20:27.684 --> 20:30.229
like a movie, a show, a soap opera.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.981
So you think Samantha
is more famous than Laila?

20:38.779 --> 20:40.530
#SAVETHEGREENAMAZON

20:40.906 --> 20:42.699
-Count to five.
-Seriously?

20:42.783 --> 20:44.952
-I'm saving the fucking Amazon! Do it.
-No.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.412
Let me see! She just posted something.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.582
Ten thousand people already
liked my picture.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.459
Am I or am I not fucking famous?

20:54.920 --> 20:57.839
<i>It was a multicolored disc</i>

20:57.923 --> 21:00.592
<i>A flying saucer</i>

21:00.676 --> 21:02.302
<i>So bright</i>

21:03.387 --> 21:05.639
<i>A beautiful sight</i>

21:07.808 --> 21:10.560
<i>Today, I'm going to read a letter</i>
<i>from Rodrigo Menezes,</i>

21:10.644 --> 21:12.604
<i>from São Raimundo Nonato.</i>

21:13.063 --> 21:15.190
<i>Look how cute...</i>

21:15.691 --> 21:18.193
<i>He gave me his tooth!</i>

21:19.361 --> 21:23.156
It costs nothing for these people
to like your picture, Laila.

21:23.573 --> 21:27.077
What you need to understand
is that a fan of mine at that time

21:27.160 --> 21:30.080
is worth 100,000 of your fans today,
got it?

21:30.163 --> 21:33.625
I'm not trying to offend you.
I swear. I like you.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.919
But it's different being on television.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.339
I also like you, Samantha!

21:39.423 --> 21:42.175
When Dodoi told me
that you were in "Paris"

21:42.259 --> 21:44.970
to overcome a trauma,
my heart ached, you know?

21:45.053 --> 21:46.054
What are you saying?

21:46.138 --> 21:49.182
I kept thinking if I should do a campaign,

21:49.266 --> 21:52.602
like a crowdfunding,
to really send her to Paris.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.855
-Is that a threat?
-No!

21:55.230 --> 21:58.442
Now that I know you so well,
I know you're so...

21:59.568 --> 22:00.777
"real-life".

22:01.111 --> 22:02.988
You are real, Samantha.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.410
They're not laughing anymore!
That's a bad sign. I know!

22:12.581 --> 22:15.709
-What happened to you?
-It's for the Amazon rainforest, Dad.

22:15.792 --> 22:20.255
Nice! This will distract your mom!
Can you go in there?

22:20.339 --> 22:23.467
Dad, people are cursing you on Twitter.

22:23.550 --> 22:27.471
-I don't have Twitter.
-You do. Look at this death threat.

22:28.388 --> 22:33.018
"After I kill you, I'll wear your skin."
A nine-year-old girl said that?

22:33.101 --> 22:35.103
You shouldn't have mistreated Laila.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.482
Samantha Enterprise, good morning!

22:38.565 --> 22:41.860
Actually, I think that having
your own doll is kind of tacky.

22:41.943 --> 22:45.113
It's not about tackiness,
it's about talent, you know?

22:47.032 --> 22:49.701
For both your own sake,
I hope that comes out!

22:49.785 --> 22:53.163
You see? Everything for the Amazon.
Your kids are on my side!

22:53.246 --> 22:57.375
-Mom, it's a call for you, it's from...
-Honey, I'm in Paris, I made that clear!

22:57.459 --> 23:00.629
-It's from TV, Mom.
-TV? What do you mean?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.714
Give me that phone! Hello?

23:02.798 --> 23:06.259
Hi, I'm so sorry for the delay,
I'm out of the country, you know.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.846
What rumor? I haven't heard any rumors.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.599
It's funny, I was walking
around Versailles today!

23:13.016 --> 23:15.393
Silvio wants to talk to me? OK!

23:15.936 --> 23:18.188
Tell him to call me.
I'll look at my schedule.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.856
I think I can do it.

23:19.940 --> 23:24.945
I'm absolutely sure I can, let's do this.
All right! Thank you! Kisses!

23:25.737 --> 23:29.908
I've just been invited to a soap opera!
Mommy is back on television!

23:30.909 --> 23:34.830
You're talking to the sister-in-law
of the Queen of France's lover!

23:34.913 --> 23:36.540
I can't believe it worked!

23:36.623 --> 23:38.083
It's almost official.

23:38.166 --> 23:41.086
But once Silvio speaks to me,
he'll understand my charisma.

23:41.169 --> 23:44.339
-Nobody resists Samantha!
-Mommy's going to be beheaded!

23:44.422 --> 23:47.384
Yes! And it was so easy!
You didn't have to do anything.

23:47.467 --> 23:51.346
What do you mean? I used the power
of internet in my favor, right, Laila?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.890
Sincerely, I'm not thankful.

23:56.643 --> 24:00.230
Hey, Laila, look what I made for you.
Guava croissants of forgiveness.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.440
Don't you want to post this
on social media?

24:02.524 --> 24:04.943
Look, a couple that deserves each other.

24:05.026 --> 24:08.405
You were made for one another!
Hashtag "ciao". They contain gluten!

24:08.488 --> 24:11.158
Laila, some girl wants to tear
my skin off, she's nine!

24:11.741 --> 24:13.285
It's Silvio! Watch and learn.

24:14.119 --> 24:18.957
Hi, Silvio, how are you, honey?
Long time! Yes, we can talk!

24:19.207 --> 24:21.668
I can't meet in person, I'm in Paris.

24:23.044 --> 24:28.216
Oh, you too? Well, it's just that
I'm super busy, but... No!

24:28.300 --> 24:31.511
The soap opera is my priority!
Always! No...

24:32.095 --> 24:33.513
How far is Paris?

24:34.598 --> 24:36.683
Silvio, here's the thing...

24:37.309 --> 24:40.187
I'm stuck in traffic.
There's snow everywhere.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.981
Silvio, for God's sake,
we know each other!

24:43.064 --> 24:46.443
Hello? Hello, Silvio? Hello?

24:47.736 --> 24:48.612
Did he hang up?

24:49.821 --> 24:51.573
I needed to be in Paris.

24:54.492 --> 24:57.621
I didn't even want to do this soap opera,
it's an outdated genre.

24:59.206 --> 25:02.542
Actually, I was going to do it for Silvio.
I need to focus on me.

25:03.126 --> 25:04.336
Croissant?

25:05.837 --> 25:08.465
No, but it's OK.
I don't want you following that girl!

25:08.548 --> 25:10.675
Enough of this horrible green hair!

25:10.759 --> 25:12.385
-You were jealous.
-Me, jealous?

25:12.761 --> 25:15.347
Dodoi, you know what?
All of this is your fault.

25:15.430 --> 25:18.099
You went to a party looking for work,
look what you found.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.476
-What did I find?
-What?

25:19.559 --> 25:20.810
I forgot Laila's name...

25:20.894 --> 25:23.730
but I scheduled a meeting
with a sports radio station.

25:23.813 --> 25:26.024
You must have given
a great first impression.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.443
-And you were jealous.
-Jealous? Stop!

25:28.526 --> 25:31.404
-You were jealous.
-I was not.

25:31.488 --> 25:33.490
You and your lousy taste for women.

25:34.991 --> 25:38.119
-Ouch, Mom.
-What, honey? It's coming out.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.871
<i>I just woke up, guys.</i>

25:41.039 --> 25:42.666
<i>I'm here having a coffee,</i>

25:42.749 --> 25:45.835
<i>eating my typical Parisian croissant.</i>

25:51.508 --> 25:54.177
I found our mysterious brunette.

26:59.743 --> 27:03.788
Coming soon, <i>Passion and</i>
<i>Revolution 2: The Fall of the Bastille.</i>

27:03.872 --> 27:08.043
If they don't have bread,
let them eat croissant! <i>Oui!</i>

27:09.305 --> 27:15.928
