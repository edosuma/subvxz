00:01.697 --> 00:03.568
[dramatic music]

00:14.318 --> 00:15.754
[knock on door]

00:15.841 --> 00:18.583
Jane? You in there?

00:18.670 --> 00:19.932
I'm up. I'm up.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.412
Homicide in San Francisco.

00:21.499 --> 00:23.980
Cho and Rigsby are already
on their way.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.329
Did you sleep here?

00:25.416 --> 00:26.852
No, I was working.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.593
It looks like
you were sleeping.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.682
[clears throat]
Well, I programmed my, uh

00:30.769 --> 00:32.293
dreams to work
on the Red John case.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.643
Oh, well, then make sure
you put in for overtime.

00:34.730 --> 00:37.428
Ah, healthy skepticism.
I like it. But it could work.

00:37.515 --> 00:41.432
Mendeleev saw the entire
periodic table in his dream.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.782
- That's nice for him. Jane?
- Shall we?

00:43.869 --> 00:45.871
As a friend..

00:45.958 --> 00:47.177
...this doesn't look good.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.309
[clears throat]

00:48.396 --> 00:50.311
[instrumental music]

00:50.398 --> 00:51.703
Keeps me going.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.794
[indistinct chattering]

00:59.798 --> 01:01.757
There's evidence
of a physical confrontation

01:01.844 --> 01:03.280
and this is where he ended up.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.934
He was on his back
when the shots were fired.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.153
Eight to ten rounds
to the head.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.545
- Whew. What head?
- Yeah.

01:07.632 --> 01:08.981
Ew.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.548
Two motel guests heard
muffled pops

01:10.635 --> 01:12.811
around 1:00 a.m.,
figured it was city traffic.

01:12.898 --> 01:14.813
No defense wounds. You'd think
he would've at least put up

01:14.900 --> 01:16.206
his hands to shield his face.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.729
Or it depends on
how hard he fell.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.775
Forensics recovered
the casings. 9 millimeter.

01:19.862 --> 01:21.124
Also collected a cigarette butt

01:21.211 --> 01:22.256
and some red fibers
around the body.

01:22.343 --> 01:25.433
You woke me for this?

01:25.520 --> 01:27.913
This man is a sociopath.
He should've been in prison.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.960
He was. Full pardon
two days ago. Name's Henry Dahl.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.483
Convicted nine years ago

01:32.570 --> 01:34.311
in the rape and murder
of one Jennie Winter.

01:34.398 --> 01:37.532
Was a lifer at Del Norte until
a new DNA test set him free.

01:37.619 --> 01:38.794
How'd you peg him as an inmate?

01:38.881 --> 01:40.709
Give me a break.
A classic rooster build.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.537
Massive upper body, skinny legs.

01:42.624 --> 01:44.713
Jaundiced skin,
probably hepatitis "C"

01:44.800 --> 01:46.802
from the dirty needle
tattoo on his elbow.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.804
Spider web representing
the passage of time.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.675
Wh-where are you going?

01:50.762 --> 01:55.027
I'm tired, and I don't really
care who killed this creep.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.160
- He was innocent.
- Meh.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.641
He made instruments
of death out of toothpicks.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.601
[instrumental music]

02:12.088 --> 02:14.351
I know you, don't I?

02:14.438 --> 02:16.310
Are you with homicide?

02:16.397 --> 02:19.008
Right now I'm with you,
unless, uh, of course

02:19.095 --> 02:20.792
are you with homicide?

02:20.879 --> 02:22.968
Did you know it cost
taxpayers 2.4 million

02:23.055 --> 02:24.796
to convict Henry Dahl
in the murder of Jennie Winter?

02:24.883 --> 02:26.233
No kidding.
That's a lot of money.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.364
Now they'll have to spend
millions more finding

02:27.451 --> 02:28.974
and convicting Dahl's killer

02:29.061 --> 02:30.585
because the state set
a hardened criminal free.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.456
How many man hours
will youwaste chasing

02:32.543 --> 02:33.588
'Henry Dahl's killer?'

02:33.675 --> 02:34.589
Not too many.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.941
- Anything usable?
- Ah, maybe.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.253
[instrumental music]

02:54.565 --> 02:55.479
Get this.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.751
[theme music]

03:16.587 --> 03:17.936
[woman on TV]
'And I'm here to tell you'

03:18.023 --> 03:20.069
'Henry Dahl deserved
what he got.'

03:20.156 --> 03:22.376
Even the CBI agrees with me

03:22.463 --> 03:24.943
the premiere law enforcement
agency of California.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.641
Take a look
at one of their agents

03:26.728 --> 03:29.818
just two hours after the
gruesome body was discovered

03:29.905 --> 03:32.734
in a South San Francisco
motel room.

03:32.821 --> 03:36.172
'Not in too big a rush
to catch the killer, is he?'

03:36.259 --> 03:38.827
We've identified this man
as Patrick Jane

03:38.914 --> 03:41.482
the CBI's
top criminal consultant.

03:41.569 --> 03:45.312
'Sleep tight tonight, Mr. Jane.
I know I will.'

03:46.878 --> 03:49.751
This isn't unfamiliar
territory to me.

03:49.838 --> 03:52.493
A paid consultant
mistaking state contracts

03:52.580 --> 03:54.930
for a country club where
he can do as he pleases.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.237
He was tired because
he was here all night

03:57.324 --> 04:00.065
working on the Red John case.
It's completely bogus.

04:00.152 --> 04:03.243
Yeah, I know it's bogus.
But that's not how it looks.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.680
It looks like he puked
in the fish tank.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.421
Kinda does, yeah.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.249
The attorney general
has enough to worry about

04:09.336 --> 04:11.381
with the murder
of a wrongly imprisoned man.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.818
I need Jane awake on this.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.038
To be honest, I'm more
concerned about her behavior

04:16.125 --> 04:18.997
than I am about his.
The police never released

04:19.084 --> 04:21.217
Dahl's identity to the press.

04:21.304 --> 04:24.220
So what's a famous cable TV host
doing in front of the motel?

04:24.307 --> 04:25.874
Karen cross' production company

04:25.961 --> 04:28.050
footed the bill
for Henry Dahl's motel room.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.617
Dahl had driven in from Lodi

04:29.704 --> 04:31.532
to appear as a guest
on her talk show today.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.185
Explains how she knew
he was there.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.449
Wait. Their connection runs
deeper than that.

04:35.536 --> 04:38.800
Before Cross joined Trial TV,
she was a state prosecutor

04:38.887 --> 04:42.238
with 102 violent felony
convictions, no losses.

04:42.325 --> 04:43.631
Guess who one of
those convictions was?

04:43.718 --> 04:46.851
- Hello, Dahl-y.
- Don't do that.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.897
Why would Dahl appear
on the national talk show

04:48.984 --> 04:50.681
of the lawyer who put him away?

04:50.768 --> 04:52.683
Notoriety. Payback. Women.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.163
Cross can't be happy
about Dahl's name being cleared.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.643
Ruins her perfect record.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.906
Agreed. Jane and I will go
talk to her.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.603
Now did Dahl have
a local residence?

04:59.690 --> 05:01.301
A halfway house in Lodi.

05:01.388 --> 05:04.260
You and Cho, start driving.
See what you find there.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.914
I'll Grab the keys.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.046
[instrumental music]

05:10.440 --> 05:11.833
Hey, what's the matter?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.009
Oh. I had a lunch appointment.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.793
Well, I can drive
to Lodi with Cho.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.491
Oh, no. I couldn't
ask you to do that.

05:17.578 --> 05:18.970
Don't worry about it.
I'll clear it with Lisbon.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.581
You know, you go do
your lunch thing.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.800
I hope you're hungry.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.367
- Hey, Grace.
- Hey.

05:24.454 --> 05:25.760
- Rigsby.
- Hey.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.457
So you should grab a jacket.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.590
I hitched us a ride
on the tac team chopper.

05:29.677 --> 05:31.331
We're flying to lunch?

05:31.418 --> 05:33.028
Tac team was heading up north
anyhow, so they're gonna

05:33.115 --> 05:36.640
drop us off at this great
picnic spot I know on the river.

05:36.727 --> 05:38.250
I mean, you said you had
a couple hours, right?

05:38.338 --> 05:43.560
Yeah. Thank you so much.
I owe you one.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.475
[instrumental music]

05:47.521 --> 05:49.653
It's okay.
We'll stop for Big Gulps.

05:54.397 --> 05:57.182
[indistinct]

05:57.269 --> 05:58.706
[Teresa]
'How you doing?
You alright?'

05:58.793 --> 06:01.143
Eh, it's a little chilly
in here, no?

06:03.972 --> 06:07.192
Excuse me. Hi.
I'm Agent Lisbon.

06:07.279 --> 06:09.456
I think you know my colleague,
Patrick Jane.

06:09.543 --> 06:10.935
Well,
he's probably taking a nap.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.461
[indistinct]

06:14.548 --> 06:16.724
He gets nervous on TV sets.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.856
I imagine so, considering
what happened to his family

06:18.943 --> 06:20.771
after his last
talk show appearance.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.818
Even I know better than to
taunt a serial killer on air.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.298
Then you should know better
than to taunt the CBI, because--

06:26.386 --> 06:27.952
I'm a person of interest.
I get it.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.389
So let me make this
easy for you.

06:29.476 --> 06:32.261
Yes, I was outraged that
Henry Dahl was set free.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.568
Did I shoot him?
No. I was in edit bay four

06:34.655 --> 06:36.483
at the time of his murder.
The log includes

06:36.570 --> 06:38.006
a contact number for
the editor who was with me.

06:38.093 --> 06:39.790
Why'd you invite Henry
on your show?

06:39.877 --> 06:41.313
The state may have
let Henry go

06:41.401 --> 06:43.490
but my show is tougher
than any court of law.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.143
I was gonna nail him
to the cross.

06:45.230 --> 06:48.408
- Karen cross?
- You've seen my promos?

06:48.495 --> 06:51.280
Read the trial coverage, too.
It was all smoke and mirrors.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.760
You whipped the jury
into a frenzy

06:52.847 --> 06:54.457
to cover for a lack
of physical evidence.

06:54.544 --> 06:56.459
Two witnesses
put Dahl at the scene.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.461
That doesn't make him a killer.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.941
You caught a break
when the DNA test

07:00.028 --> 07:02.204
from the rape kit
came back as inconclusive.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.902
The new test excludes
Dahl as the perpetrator.

07:04.989 --> 07:06.513
You don't trust DNA?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.253
I don't trust anything coming
out of the justice system.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.777
That's why I left.

07:09.864 --> 07:11.474
I heard you left because

07:11.561 --> 07:13.128
you were gonna be fired
for ethical violations--

07:13.215 --> 07:15.609
Nothing stops me from following
my instincts, Agent Lisbon.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.088
I won't apologize for that.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.395
I spent six months deposing
and questioning Henry.

07:19.482 --> 07:22.137
I'm telling you for a fact,
that man was a reptile.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.400
[instrumental music]

07:32.495 --> 07:33.453
[clears throat]

07:40.068 --> 07:41.156
Shrink, right?

07:41.243 --> 07:43.071
Excuse me?

07:43.158 --> 07:44.812
The vest.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.553
The tea.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.163
Karen Cross
always invites a shrink

07:48.250 --> 07:49.512
to comfort the grieving mother.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.907
I'm Jodi Dahl.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.865
Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.

07:55.953 --> 07:58.303
Don't you worry about me.

07:58.390 --> 08:01.176
I've been letting go
of Henry for years.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.264
Excuse me, hon.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.837
[door closes]

08:10.881 --> 08:12.970
Tea?

08:13.057 --> 08:15.407
It's a hug in a...cup.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.845
No, no, thank you.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.281
I take it you're family, too.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.458
Max Winter.

08:22.545 --> 08:23.503
Max Winter.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.028
The widower of the victim.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.293
Truevictim.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.035
My wife's name was Jennie.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.867
There is nothing about
you that indicates loss.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.739
No scars of aged pain. Bravo.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.219
Corner seat says you're wary.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.829
Need to control
your environment.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.876
In most people,
that creates tension.

08:48.963 --> 08:50.486
But your breathing is relaxed.

08:52.619 --> 08:53.663
What's your trick, Max?

08:55.404 --> 08:58.102
It's...inner peace.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.583
The kind of peace you get when
you shoot your wife's killer?

09:02.367 --> 09:03.978
Henry was innocent, it seems.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.806
Well, if that's true,
the man that raped

09:05.893 --> 09:07.938
and cut your wife up
is still out there.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.333
That doesn't bother you?

09:11.420 --> 09:13.857
Jennifer's life
ended abruptly.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.773
Could've been a drunk driver,
could've been a meteorite.

09:16.860 --> 09:21.169
Anger is unhelpful
and unproductive.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.127
Well, I don't know.

09:23.214 --> 09:27.871
To some people, it's, uh,
it's invigorating.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.133
I'm sorry I don't fit your image

09:29.220 --> 09:30.570
of the tragic husband.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.096
You ask where my peace
comes from.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.967
[dramatic music]

09:37.054 --> 09:40.014
It's called...reconciliation.

09:40.101 --> 09:43.365
I can't undo
what happened to my wife

09:43.452 --> 09:46.107
but for the sake
of my son Jackson

09:46.194 --> 09:50.024
I can decide how I wanna
live thereafter.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.721
So I forgive Henry..

09:51.808 --> 09:54.898
or...whoever it was
who killed Jennie.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.988
I actually forgave
them long ago.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.602
Let's get you wired for sound,
Mr. Winter.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.604
- Excuse me.
- 'Where's Miss Dahl?'

10:05.735 --> 10:07.171
Okay. Bring her to the stage.

10:09.043 --> 10:11.045
This was the scene
nine years ago

10:11.132 --> 10:12.916
when Henry Dahl was attacked

10:13.003 --> 10:15.266
before a pre-trial hearing
by the husband

10:15.353 --> 10:16.485
of the woman whose throat

10:16.572 --> 10:18.400
he was accused of cutting.

10:19.444 --> 10:20.707
I'm gonna kill you, Dahl.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.143
[audience]
'Oh!'

10:23.274 --> 10:26.060
[indistinct chattering]

10:31.979 --> 10:35.591
Threedeputies were guarding
Henry Dahl that day.

10:35.678 --> 10:37.288
Now thatwas the Max I knew.

10:37.375 --> 10:40.335
'He would be dancing a jig after
hearing Henry Dahl was dead.'

10:40.422 --> 10:43.033
But am I to understand
you actually forgave Dahl

10:43.120 --> 10:46.167
before this so-called new
DNA evidence came to light?

10:46.254 --> 10:47.472
It's called
reconciliation, Karen.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.170
Meh.

10:49.257 --> 10:51.128
- 'Reconciliation?'
- 'Yeah, reconciliation. In--'

10:51.215 --> 10:52.782
[Karen]
'Oh, I'm familiar with
what reconciliation means.'

10:52.869 --> 10:55.002
'Reconciliation is basically
when family members'

10:55.089 --> 10:56.699
'of victims, they waltz over
to the prison, they decide'

10:56.786 --> 10:58.570
'they're gonna forgive
this person who murdered'

10:58.658 --> 11:01.138
'their wife or children.
I just don't buy it, Max.'

11:01.225 --> 11:03.271
[instrumental music]

11:07.492 --> 11:09.494
[male #1]
'He was only here for
two nights. I hardly saw him.'

11:09.581 --> 11:11.409
'When I did, he was
just so happy to be free.'

11:11.496 --> 11:13.107
'Who wouldn't be?'

11:13.194 --> 11:14.151
[Kimball]
'Did Mr. Dahl have
any visitors?'

11:14.238 --> 11:15.675
Yeah, the first night out.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.286
Some woman, she dropped
by for a few hours.

11:18.373 --> 11:21.593
Not bad-looking either.
The guy didn't waste much time.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.682
You catch her name?

11:22.769 --> 11:25.032
No. Sorry. Here we go.

11:30.864 --> 11:31.865
[Kimball]
'Thank you.'

11:31.952 --> 11:33.257
[Wayne]
'Thanks a lot.'

11:34.215 --> 11:35.869
[sighs]

11:35.956 --> 11:38.785
Oh, we can take it from here.
Thank you.

11:38.872 --> 11:39.786
You're welcome.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.007
Someone was looking
for something.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.836
Thank you, captain obvious.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.795
Three hours of brooding silence,
then sarcasm.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.492
It's like we're married.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.930
Sorry, Cho. It's just
Special Agent Craig O'Laughlin

11:54.017 --> 11:56.759
and his...chopper.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.805
What's she see
in that guy anyway?

11:58.892 --> 12:01.068
Ivy league degree
in criminology

12:01.155 --> 12:04.158
'6 years in the 101st airborne'

12:04.245 --> 12:06.813
and a black belt in Wushu
from a real shaolin temple.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.336
Yeah, thanks, buddy.
Whatever.

12:12.383 --> 12:15.038
- Aah!
- Cho, under the bed!

12:15.125 --> 12:16.170
[grunts]

12:16.257 --> 12:18.128
[instrumental music]

12:20.261 --> 12:21.175
[panting]

12:23.830 --> 12:25.745
- What are you doing?!
- Just go! Go!

12:34.188 --> 12:35.102
[grunts]

12:36.973 --> 12:39.019
[groaning]

12:39.106 --> 12:41.021
Bet they don't teach
that at a shaolin temple.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.073
[instrumental music]

13:00.127 --> 13:02.085
[male #2]
'Dad! In the garage!'

13:08.788 --> 13:11.529
Wow. Hi.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.531
I thought you were my dad.

13:13.618 --> 13:14.576
No.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.449
What..

13:18.536 --> 13:20.147
...an amazing phenomenon..

13:21.757 --> 13:23.628
...flying machines frozen..

13:24.542 --> 13:26.631
...in mid-air.

13:26.718 --> 13:27.676
I kinda feel sorry for 'em.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.939
Did-did you do all this?

13:30.026 --> 13:32.159
Um, no, my-my dad does.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.248
I just help out.

13:34.335 --> 13:37.207
You're Max's son.
I-I saw you at the talk show.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.470
Jackson, right?

13:39.557 --> 13:41.559
I-I-I'm-I'm looking
for your dad.

13:42.560 --> 13:43.997
Who are you?

13:44.084 --> 13:45.433
You-you a cop or something?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.696
No. Too many laws to uphold.

13:47.783 --> 13:50.438
But I-I do work with the police.

13:50.525 --> 13:54.442
Don't touch that, please.
It's-it's not cured yet.

13:54.529 --> 13:57.314
- It feels okay to me.
- It needs two more hours.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.493
[instrumental music]

14:02.580 --> 14:04.017
Can-can you go now?

14:06.236 --> 14:07.672
Uh, look, my-my dad's
not at the house.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.587
I don't know where he is.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.415
Sure, you do.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.764
You just don't want me to know.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.682
Is he hiding something?

14:17.769 --> 14:19.684
No, he's not hiding anything.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.473
- Are you?
- No. Of course not.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.389
Your dad doesn't seem like

14:28.476 --> 14:31.131
the kind of man
who would ask you to lie.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.441
Artie Mock.

14:37.528 --> 14:40.009
"Multiple arrests
for assault, battery"

14:40.096 --> 14:42.490
"battery with injury.."

14:42.577 --> 14:44.492
And today, aggravated assault
against a police officer.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.233
I'm sorry.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.451
Did I hurt you?

14:47.538 --> 14:49.584
It was just a mattress.

14:49.671 --> 14:52.152
Now what's your relationship
with Henry Dahl?

14:52.239 --> 14:53.980
Friends.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.591
We met in junior college.

14:56.678 --> 14:57.809
We were art majors.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.115
Why'd you break into his room?

14:59.202 --> 15:01.683
I was looking for my money.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.816
He owes me 22 large,
plus nine years' interest.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.298
Where were you last night?

15:08.385 --> 15:10.474
Last night?

15:10.561 --> 15:12.259
I was working graveyard
at the plant.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.348
And, no, I didn't kill him.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.785
I mean, now I ain't ever
gonna see what's mine.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.657
What did Dahl owe you for?

15:19.744 --> 15:22.269
Statute of limitations on drug
dealing is what, six years?

15:22.356 --> 15:24.271
Six years.

15:24.358 --> 15:27.535
In that case, Henry and I ran
a small business in college.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.539
We-we weren't very good at art

15:31.626 --> 15:35.195
so we started
distributing cocaine.

15:35.282 --> 15:38.241
- That's a natural transition.
- That's what we said.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.939
No, H-Henry was storing
a shipment

15:40.026 --> 15:41.679
and-and he gets popped
for murder.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.290
2 kilos.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.074
I visited him in prison,
and he tells me

15:45.161 --> 15:47.859
that the-the stash gets
confiscated, so I let it go.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.513
But then the day
that Henry gets out of prison

15:49.600 --> 15:51.907
he starts flossing about taking
his girlfriend to Jamaica

15:51.994 --> 15:55.128
so I'm thinking he's still
got those drugs hidden.

15:55.215 --> 15:57.347
- His girl?
- Mm-hmm.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.436
Henry'd been out for two days.
When did he find a girlfriend?

15:59.523 --> 16:02.570
She found him, in prison.

16:02.657 --> 16:03.571
They were pen pals.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.530
According to Del Norte

16:06.617 --> 16:09.011
Henry Dahl had just one name
on his approved e-mail list

16:09.098 --> 16:11.883
a woman named Betsy Meyers
from Lodi, his hometown.

16:11.971 --> 16:17.106
Lodi, yeah, I was just there
today. Long drive. Hot.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.152
She and Dahl had a thing
going in high school.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.892
She reached out to him
two months ago

16:20.980 --> 16:24.157
'rekindled their romance.
But there's just one problem.'

16:24.244 --> 16:26.115
- Betsy's married?
- Yes, to a Sean Meyers.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.552
He's a factory worker. They've
been together for seven years.

16:28.639 --> 16:29.814
Somebody should question him.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.033
Agreed.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.904
Someone who hasn't been
to Lodi yet.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.994
I want to see how willingly
they come to us.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.386
Let's call them in
in the morning.

16:36.473 --> 16:38.171
In the meantime there's
no shortage of suspects

16:38.258 --> 16:39.911
who hated Henry Dahl.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.002
23 people threatened his life
during his murder trial

16:43.089 --> 16:44.655
most of which were
friends or family

16:44.742 --> 16:47.745
of the alleged victim.
Here's a list of those names

16:47.832 --> 16:52.446
courtesy of our cable
television friend, Miss Cross.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.535
We got a lot of eyes on us
on this one.

16:54.622 --> 16:56.667
I want you to stay late
and run down these names.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.110
[gunfire]

17:12.422 --> 17:13.336
Bravo.

17:15.382 --> 17:16.296
Oh.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.781
I had a feeling
I'd see you again.

17:23.868 --> 17:26.306
Takes a confident man
to visit a shooting range

17:26.393 --> 17:27.959
when he's still
a murder suspect.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.787
Or an innocent one.
I never got your name.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.833
- I'm sorry?
- Never got your name.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.095
Uh, Patrick Jane.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.183
What kind of gun
do you use, Patrick?

17:34.270 --> 17:35.880
Oh, no. I don't, I don't use.

17:35.967 --> 17:39.449
No? That's, uh, a little strange
for a policeman, isn't it?

17:39.536 --> 17:41.843
Me, I-I like a well-balanced 45.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.454
Best combination of power,
accuracy, and kick.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.241
- Whoa.
- Hey, hey. Careful. Whoa.

17:48.328 --> 17:49.764
Whoa, watch the muzzle sweep.

17:49.851 --> 17:51.200
- 'Sorry'
- 'You never point at anything'

17:51.287 --> 17:52.506
'you don't want to shoot.'

17:52.593 --> 17:54.725
[dramatic music]

17:58.207 --> 17:59.121
Um..

18:01.776 --> 18:02.864
[whirring]

18:02.951 --> 18:05.780
[sighs]
So..

18:05.867 --> 18:07.260
...how can I help you,
Patrick?

18:07.347 --> 18:09.610
Well, um, I'm just curious
to hear how you did it.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.483
How I did what?

18:13.570 --> 18:15.094
Forgave your wife's killer.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.270
Ah. So you believe me now.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.836
Well, I wouldn't
get carried away

18:18.923 --> 18:21.535
but I-I did find out that
you've become quite the, uh

18:21.622 --> 18:25.669
evangelist for reconciliation,
corporate talks and all.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.193
You know why I came here
in the first place?

18:27.280 --> 18:28.368
I manage real estate funds.

18:28.455 --> 18:32.067
I never touched a weapon
in my life.

18:32.154 --> 18:36.985
But then Jennie was butchered,
and I needed a release.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.466
At first, I pretended
the targets were Henry Dahl

18:39.553 --> 18:42.556
and now, they're just targets.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.472
It's a discipline. Very Zen.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.257
You found the gift
of forgiveness through firearms.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.303
Yeah, shooting helped me cope.

18:50.390 --> 18:51.739
My son led me to forgiveness.

18:51.826 --> 18:55.134
All this rage inside me,
that lust for vengeance

18:55.221 --> 18:58.049
I could see I was
scaring Jackson.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.529
I didn't want to lose him, too.

18:59.616 --> 19:02.228
Lo and behold,
Henry Dahl was exonerated

19:02.315 --> 19:03.533
like a sign from above.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.056
Yes. Exactly.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.319
I just wish
I had forgiven him sooner.

19:07.798 --> 19:10.497
Do you have children, Patrick?

19:10.584 --> 19:11.585
No.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.674
[dramatic music]

19:20.942 --> 19:21.899
Try it.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.729
No better pain relief.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.430
- I'm not in pain.
- No?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.520
I sense pain.

19:33.607 --> 19:34.999
Ah, it's nothing
a gun will fix.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.873
By the way, I don't own a gun.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.831
I just rent them
while I'm here.

19:40.918 --> 19:44.574
And I was with my son, at home,
at the time of the murder.

19:44.661 --> 19:46.924
Just, uh..

19:47.011 --> 19:48.012
...in case you're interested.

19:49.710 --> 19:50.841
- It's gonna get loud. Yeah.
- Oh.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.194
I'll just step back here.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.850
[gunfire]

19:59.937 --> 20:02.636
Henry had a beautiful spirit.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.420
That whole bad boy thing

20:04.507 --> 20:07.380
that was always just an act.

20:07.467 --> 20:10.078
He even wanted to try acting
when he got out of prison.

20:10.165 --> 20:11.427
How did you know that?

20:11.514 --> 20:13.734
He told me...in his e-mails.

20:15.779 --> 20:18.042
Did you know that your wife
was exchanging e-mails

20:18.129 --> 20:19.435
with a convicted felon?

20:19.522 --> 20:22.656
Yeah, I was taking
dictation for her.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.353
What do you think? No.

20:24.440 --> 20:25.615
Betsy, according to the prison

20:25.702 --> 20:27.835
you'd been writing Henry
for two months.

20:27.922 --> 20:30.098
- Why'd you reach out to him?
- Yeah, why didyou?

20:31.969 --> 20:33.928
You've had a first love, right?

20:34.015 --> 20:35.843
You know that feeling?

20:35.930 --> 20:37.845
It never really goes away..

20:37.932 --> 20:39.063
...not totally.

20:41.022 --> 20:42.893
I never thought
that Henry killed anyone

20:42.980 --> 20:45.200
and when I read that
there was new DNA evidence

20:45.287 --> 20:47.811
I just wanted to say
"woot, woot," you know.

20:48.638 --> 20:49.596
'As a friend.'

20:51.380 --> 20:53.687
Does this sound like friends?

20:53.774 --> 20:56.646
"Dear Henry,
wild thoughts in my head."

20:56.733 --> 20:59.301
"I know I shouldn't wonder
what your body feels like now."

20:59.388 --> 21:01.216
- But it's all--"
- Okay, stop. Alright?

21:01.303 --> 21:02.391
[dramatic music]

21:02.478 --> 21:04.524
Why are you doing this to me?

21:04.611 --> 21:06.439
My husband is sitting
right here.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.747
I'm sorry.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.183
I'm so sorry.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.795
She is so full of it.

21:14.882 --> 21:18.233
What? She wrote some stuff
to a guy. There's worse crimes.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.495
[Teresa]
'Betsy, tell me the truth.'

21:19.582 --> 21:21.062
You heard.
She's in love with him.

21:21.149 --> 21:22.542
No, that's not true.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.329
I really just started
writing him as a friend.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.115
We were arguing so much.

21:32.247 --> 21:34.597
And he knew me so well.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.295
'He started saying
all the things to me'

21:36.382 --> 21:38.035
'that you stopped
saying years ago.'

21:41.256 --> 21:44.172
Did you have any contact with
him after he was released?

21:44.259 --> 21:46.217
Only in e-mails.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.046
Betsy, we showed a photo
of you to the manager

21:49.133 --> 21:51.353
of the halfway house
Henry was living in.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.660
He identified you
as the woman who visited Henry

21:53.747 --> 21:55.139
the day after his release.

21:57.751 --> 21:58.665
You slept with him?

22:00.623 --> 22:01.755
Oh, hush.

22:01.842 --> 22:04.192
I didn't say anything.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.889
What is this, marriage counsel?

22:05.976 --> 22:07.804
[Wayne]
'They're suspects
in the shooting.'

22:07.891 --> 22:09.197
These two?

22:09.284 --> 22:10.851
Really? Hmm.

22:12.069 --> 22:13.897
Um..

22:13.984 --> 22:15.203
Can I see your gun?

22:15.290 --> 22:16.987
Hmm?

22:17.074 --> 22:18.728
Where were the two of you
at 1:00 a.m.?

22:18.815 --> 22:21.470
Drinking beers
at the Lamplighter.

22:21.557 --> 22:25.213
Hi. Patrick Jane. Very nice
to meet you. Hold that, please.

22:25.300 --> 22:26.823
- 'Whoa. Okay.'
- I'm sorry. Here.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.216
What the hell are you doing?

22:28.303 --> 22:29.739
It's okay.
Rigsby took the bullets out.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.916
Muzzle sweeps. They have
no idea how to handle a gun.

22:33.003 --> 22:37.356
Give me a break. Van pelt, run
down Betsy andSean's alibis.

22:37.443 --> 22:38.574
You, outside!

22:39.401 --> 22:40.359
Excuse me.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.189
Soyou're a gun expert now?

22:45.276 --> 22:47.583
No, not me. Max Winter.
You should see him shoot.

22:47.670 --> 22:48.715
Did he shoot Dahl?

22:48.802 --> 22:50.281
What caliber was
the murder weapon?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.545
- 9 millimeter.
- Yeah, Max prefers a 45.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.895
Oh, shucks.
I guess he's innocent.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.637
Here's a revised suspect list.
Max is still on it.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.378
And I hope you got
some sleep last night

22:59.465 --> 23:02.206
because we're going to Lodi
to run interviews.

23:02.293 --> 23:03.730
I just got back from Lodi.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.906
Van leaves in 20 minutes.
Be outside.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.908
[instrumental music]

23:11.738 --> 23:13.914
Patrick Jane, I didn't
recognize you yesterday

23:14.001 --> 23:16.873
at the crime scene. You were
quite the psychic once.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.614
Oh, there's no such thing
as psychics.

23:18.701 --> 23:21.008
So you say now.

23:21.095 --> 23:23.227
Your cold reading of a serial
killer on live television

23:23.314 --> 23:25.708
led to the brutal murder
of your wife and daughter.

23:25.795 --> 23:28.319
Oh. Really?
Thanks for reminding me.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.321
Mr. Jane, I am on your side.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.888
You were a victim
of violent crime

23:31.975 --> 23:34.413
and now you help others.
That's wonderful.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.024
Don't tell me you don't have
the psychic stuff.

23:37.111 --> 23:39.679
What are you doing for the CBI
if you're not psychic?

23:39.766 --> 23:41.202
Are you scamming them,
Mr. Jane?

23:41.289 --> 23:43.073
No, Karen, I am not.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.989
Well, prove it.
Identify Dahl's killer.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.733
Well, if I had Carte Blanche
to do things my way

23:50.820 --> 23:53.170
I would do just that, but they
don't give me carte blanche.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.651
The CBI won't, but I will.

23:55.738 --> 23:56.652
Deputy?

23:58.219 --> 23:59.481
You've been served.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.309
You are hereby
commanded to testify

24:01.396 --> 24:03.877
before a studio audience
of your peers.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.574
What do you need
to solve this crime?

24:05.661 --> 24:06.575
'Name it.'

24:08.185 --> 24:10.144
Well, I suppose, uh..

24:10.231 --> 24:13.408
I need the help of those that
are affected by Dahl's murder.

24:13.495 --> 24:16.498
Those two you had on
your show yesterday would do.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.413
I'll bring them back.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.938
And, uh, I guess,
uh, I need suspects.

24:22.025 --> 24:25.028
Yeah. Make sure these people
are in the audience.

24:25.115 --> 24:27.553
Give 'em an appearance fee,
whatever it takes.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.425
[instrumental music]

24:39.129 --> 24:40.479
Beats driving back to Lodi.

24:47.094 --> 24:48.399
[instrumental music]

24:50.532 --> 24:55.015
You saw him here first,
the sleeping CBI agent.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.974
Well, get ready to meet him.

24:58.061 --> 25:01.935
Patrick Jane, psychic detective?
Tragic victim?

25:02.022 --> 25:03.414
You be the judge today at 3:00

25:03.502 --> 25:05.765
when Mr. Jane taps
his mind's eye

25:05.852 --> 25:08.028
to reveal who killed Henry Dahl.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.596
[indistinct]

25:10.683 --> 25:14.121
Well, where is he?
We're five minutes to air.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.905
Without him, it's just
a rehash of yesterday's show.

25:15.992 --> 25:19.605
- I've left messages everywhere.
- Oh.

25:19.692 --> 25:23.391
Oh. Sorry I'm late. I had to
stop by a bed and bath boutique.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.872
Mr. Jane, there is a reason
that I asked you to arrive

25:25.959 --> 25:27.830
two hours early. I need to
walk you through the lineup.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.005
Are all my suspects here?

25:29.092 --> 25:30.746
Yeah, they're
in the first two rows.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.270
Now the lineup, I'll start
with my state of the union

25:33.357 --> 25:34.794
and then we're just gonna
roll a clip to introduce you.

25:34.881 --> 25:35.925
A clip?

25:36.012 --> 25:38.580
Uh, y--well,
just some old footage.

25:38.667 --> 25:39.973
My Red John
talk show appearance.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.018
Oh, no, just save-save
your reaction for on-air.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.542
I really want you
to relive the moment

25:43.629 --> 25:45.892
Excuse me, Karen.
I gotta hand out candles.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.720
Candles? Wait.
What-what candles?

25:47.807 --> 25:49.504
Hey, folks.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.810
I hope Lodi is
treating you well.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.639
A little treat from Karen Cross.

25:53.726 --> 25:56.467
Hand them out. One each.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.558
Here you go. Pass that back
to him, please. Thank you.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.212
Ah, Jackson.

26:02.299 --> 26:05.476
Here to see the old man again,
are you? Here.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.478
A candle.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.958
We need you onstage now.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.308
Oh, I have to hand these out.
They're for my act.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.745
Unless, uh, what are you doing?

26:14.529 --> 26:16.879
Everybody must have one.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.838
Okay? I need these. Thank you.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.538
- Patrick.
- Max.

26:23.625 --> 26:24.974
[applause]

26:25.061 --> 26:26.976
[instrumental music]

26:38.988 --> 26:41.121
You've probably read stories

26:41.208 --> 26:44.646
about psychics who help
the police solve murder cases.

26:44.733 --> 26:48.302
Well, today, we're gonna take
a peek behind the mystic's veil

26:48.389 --> 26:50.347
to see how that's done.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.872
To introduce our featured guest

26:52.959 --> 26:55.657
we have a dramatic video clip
of his last talk show--

26:55.744 --> 26:57.833
Uh, Karen, sorry to interrupt.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.356
Uh, Mr. Jane, I'll get
to you in a minute.

26:59.443 --> 27:01.010
Could you please sit down?

27:01.097 --> 27:03.622
You-you-you wanted to tell me
something about the lineup.

27:03.709 --> 27:07.451
I forget. The lineup,
did you tell me?

27:07.538 --> 27:10.672
The lineup, I forget.
Forget the lineup.

27:10.759 --> 27:13.544
- What is the lineup?
- Uh--

27:13.632 --> 27:15.242
Let me remind you.
Ladies and gentlemen

27:15.329 --> 27:17.418
it is time
to unmask the shooter.

27:17.505 --> 27:18.680
[audience]
'Ohh.'

27:18.767 --> 27:20.290
What you have all
just witnessed

27:20.377 --> 27:23.816
is a remarkable piece
of mental tomfoolery

27:23.903 --> 27:26.949
from our psychic guest star,
Patrick Jane.

27:27.036 --> 27:29.996
However, this is not
Mr. Jane's show

27:30.083 --> 27:32.912
So I'm gonna ask Mr. Jane
again to please sit down.

27:32.999 --> 27:36.350
I'm sorry. I forget. Whose show
is it? Whose show? I forget.

27:36.437 --> 27:38.004
I forget whose show. Forget--

27:38.091 --> 27:40.789
W-will you stop doing that?
You are a guest here.

27:40.876 --> 27:44.184
Well, actually, no.
I was, uh, summoned.

27:44.271 --> 27:46.186
Are you sure this is
how you want to play it?

27:46.273 --> 27:49.319
You really wanna make yourself
a sorrier spectacle?

27:49.406 --> 27:51.191
Oh, is there anyone more
sorry than you, Karen

27:51.278 --> 27:55.021
with your morbid interest in all
things shocking or repulsive?

27:55.108 --> 27:57.632
You pretend to be a victim's
advocate, but you're a vulture

27:57.719 --> 27:59.939
preying on the carrion
of human suffering.

28:00.026 --> 28:01.027
Are you gonna give me
that carte blanche

28:01.114 --> 28:02.158
you promised me or not?

28:02.245 --> 28:04.552
- Yeah, buddy, go.
- Yeah.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.641
[audience cheering]
You gonna give me
that carte blanche?

28:09.078 --> 28:11.907
'I feel like getting me
some carte blanche.'

28:11.994 --> 28:15.694
Okay, Mr. Jane,
let the psychic wonders unfurl.

28:18.044 --> 28:21.047
There's no such thing
as psychics, Karen.

28:21.134 --> 28:24.703
Only entertainers skilled
in the art of deception.

28:24.790 --> 28:26.443
But I'm happy to, uh

28:26.530 --> 28:28.837
perform
a psychic "demonstration."

28:30.317 --> 28:33.407
Usually begins
with a fantastic claim

28:33.494 --> 28:38.412
such as Henry Dahl's killer is
sitting in this room right now.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.979
[indistinct chattering]

28:40.066 --> 28:43.373
and then, uh, any good psychic
would make sure

28:43.460 --> 28:46.507
that the front row is full
of actual police suspects

28:46.594 --> 28:49.379
which I believe that we have
done for you today.

28:49.466 --> 28:51.555
Then he might go on and explain

28:51.642 --> 28:54.384
how, uh, a-a spirit
that has crossed over

28:54.471 --> 28:58.911
still has the power to
manipulate energy in our world

28:58.998 --> 29:01.435
creating noises, moving objects

29:01.522 --> 29:03.959
and sometimes
even starting fires

29:04.046 --> 29:08.094
and that is what Henry Dahl
is gonna do for us right now.

29:08.181 --> 29:11.401
Henry Dahl will light a candle

29:11.488 --> 29:13.882
to reveal his shooter.

29:13.969 --> 29:16.363
[indistinct chattering]

29:16.450 --> 29:19.279
- Dim the lights, please.
- Oh, I can't wait for this.

29:19.366 --> 29:21.107
That's the spirit.
That's your candle.

29:21.194 --> 29:22.935
Oh. There is one other thing.

29:23.022 --> 29:25.589
A truly world-class psychic
would invite police officials

29:25.676 --> 29:28.201
up on the stage
to make an arrest

29:28.288 --> 29:30.464
once the killer
has been unmasked.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.727
And today, we are very
fortunate to have some, uh

29:32.814 --> 29:35.686
conveniently
telegenic CBI officers

29:35.774 --> 29:37.384
uh, Agent Wayne Rigsby

29:37.471 --> 29:41.127
and the pocket rocket,
the dynamite, heavily armed

29:41.214 --> 29:43.477
cute as a button
Agent Teresa Lisbon.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.609
Ladies and gentlemen,
a round of applause.

29:45.696 --> 29:47.829
[cheering]

29:50.092 --> 29:52.878
Ladies and gentlemen, please

29:52.965 --> 29:55.315
raise your candles
high above your heads

29:55.402 --> 29:59.188
while we wait for Henry Dahl
to reveal his shooter.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.364
[dramatic music]

30:02.626 --> 30:05.281
Speak to us, Henry.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.501
Speak to us from beyond

30:07.588 --> 30:08.894
the great beyond.

30:20.557 --> 30:21.863
- This is ridiculous--
- Ah.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.050
Wait.

30:35.137 --> 30:39.228
Jackson Winter,
of course.

30:39.315 --> 30:40.839
Uh, you think it was me?

30:40.926 --> 30:42.841
Henry Dahl was convicted
of killing your mother

30:42.928 --> 30:46.409
but you didn't buy the DNA
test that set him free, did you?

30:46.496 --> 30:48.150
What are you doing?

30:48.237 --> 30:49.412
[Karen]
'Of course he didn't
believe the DNA.'

30:49.499 --> 30:52.241
I presented an ironclad case.

30:52.328 --> 30:55.505
And the owner of a certain
firing range I visited

30:55.592 --> 30:59.161
tells me that Jackson, in fact,
does like to shoot guns.

30:59.248 --> 31:01.250
Prefers a nine millimeter

31:01.337 --> 31:03.078
same caliber
as the murder weapon.

31:03.165 --> 31:05.994
Look...I didn't shoot anyone,
okay? Dad--

31:06.081 --> 31:10.520
What's more, forensics matched
red fibers from the murder scene

31:10.607 --> 31:12.435
with carpet fibers
from the firing range.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.481
Stop it. You stop this.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.178
My son didn't do anything.

31:16.265 --> 31:18.964
Casting blame on him
like this, it'll ruin his life.

31:19.051 --> 31:20.704
I know.

31:20.791 --> 31:22.184
Then don't do it.

31:22.271 --> 31:23.185
Don't let me.

31:25.709 --> 31:28.495
Alright. You leave him alone.

31:28.582 --> 31:30.323
It was me.

31:30.410 --> 31:31.367
I shot Henry Dahl.

31:31.454 --> 31:32.978
[indistinct chattering]

31:34.588 --> 31:37.156
Or he is just lying
to protect his son.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.375
- Agents, arrest him.
- I'm not lying.

31:39.462 --> 31:41.160
He's not lying.
His son told me.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.208
What are you talking about?
No, I didn't.

31:46.295 --> 31:49.559
Epoxy takes 12 hours to cure.

31:49.646 --> 31:50.952
Yesterday you told me that

31:51.039 --> 31:52.693
that model only needed
two more hours.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.390
That puts you working
in the garage

31:54.477 --> 31:56.392
in the middle of the night.
Your son wasn't asleep.

31:56.479 --> 31:59.569
He heard you leaving. That's why
he wanted to protect you, right?

31:59.656 --> 32:00.701
Alright, let him be.

32:05.575 --> 32:07.882
I pulled the trigger

32:07.969 --> 32:09.188
and I can prove it.

32:09.275 --> 32:10.929
[instrumental music]

32:20.286 --> 32:22.592
[male #3]
'You'll find his prints
on the gun.'

32:22.679 --> 32:24.594
Ballistics will match
the casings.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.031
How did you obtain it?

32:26.118 --> 32:28.163
Gun trafficker eight years ago.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.383
You purchased an illegal weapon
eight years ago. Why?

32:32.602 --> 32:33.995
Dahl was a lifer
in a state pen.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.301
You had no way of knowing
he'd get out.

32:35.388 --> 32:37.390
[dramatic music]

32:40.088 --> 32:42.047
Oh, you wanna stop
talking now? That's fine.

32:42.134 --> 32:44.310
All bets are off.

32:44.397 --> 32:45.833
We're gonna take you
and your son into custody.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.922
No, j-just..

32:48.009 --> 32:49.097
...just wait.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.060
I knew Henry was gonna get out

32:55.147 --> 32:57.149
because I'm the one
who set him free.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.326
How'd you know?

33:00.413 --> 33:03.416
Well, he's a man
of infinite patience

33:03.503 --> 33:05.548
and suppressed rage.

33:05.635 --> 33:08.682
His wife's killer had
to die by his own hand.

33:08.769 --> 33:11.554
He had no choice.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.339
[Kimball]
Okay, you're gonna have
to help me out a little bit.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.036
How did you set Dahl free?

33:15.123 --> 33:17.952
I'm a fund manager at
a real estate investment firm.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.824
I used one fund
to buy up old warehouses

33:20.911 --> 33:22.870
safe investment,
convert 'em into condos

33:22.957 --> 33:26.265
and that's how my firm came to
own a certain bay area warehouse

33:26.352 --> 33:28.049
used for evidence storage.

33:28.136 --> 33:29.355
Including DNA.

33:29.442 --> 33:30.399
[Max]
'It took since months

33:30.486 --> 33:32.053
'to pull the condo permits.'

33:32.140 --> 33:33.837
'I used that time to gain
access to the property'

33:33.924 --> 33:36.188
and I swapped out
Dahl's DNA sample.

33:36.275 --> 33:39.713
Dahl passes retest.
You kill Dahl.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.367
You should sell the book rights.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.282
Hold on. My client never
said he killed Henry Dahl.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.501
Your client confessed
on basic cable.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.721
Toshooting Dahl.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.157
Hello.

33:49.244 --> 33:51.246
I shot that piece of filth.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.335
I shot him right in the face.

33:53.422 --> 33:55.685
[dramatic music]

33:55.772 --> 33:58.949
But I didn't kill Henry Dahl.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.386
He was already dead.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.476
That's a development.

34:03.563 --> 34:05.826
How do you know Dahl was dead?

34:05.913 --> 34:07.567
Back of his head
was busted open.

34:07.654 --> 34:09.395
He was lying in a pool of blood.

34:09.482 --> 34:10.439
Maybe he was still breathing.

34:10.526 --> 34:13.573
No. I checked for a pulse.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.401
I don't buy it.

34:15.488 --> 34:18.534
If you knew Dahl was dead,
why'd you shoot him nine times?

34:26.629 --> 34:29.937
Because he murdered my wife.

34:30.024 --> 34:31.721
Uh-oh.

34:31.808 --> 34:32.766
What?

34:36.726 --> 34:37.771
He's telling the truth.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.166
With no head left to speak of

34:41.253 --> 34:42.906
the coroner can't make
a definitely call

34:42.993 --> 34:45.257
but he did say there was less
blood loss than expected

34:45.344 --> 34:47.389
which supports
postmortem gunshots.

34:47.476 --> 34:49.565
Well, in that case..

34:49.652 --> 34:51.393
...let's go pick out
the actual killer, shall we?

34:53.047 --> 34:55.005
It's kind of obvious now,
isn't it?

34:55.093 --> 34:57.747
I mean, shooting is a crime
of planning. That's Max.

34:57.834 --> 35:02.230
He built an entire fleet
of planes with his hands.

35:02.317 --> 35:05.277
- But a blow to the head?
- Crime of passion.

35:05.364 --> 35:06.452
[Grace]
'A lot of emotions
were flying around'

35:06.539 --> 35:08.106
that interrogation room
yesterday.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.369
The jilted husband,
Sean Meyers, I felt his pain.

35:10.456 --> 35:12.327
Meyers said he
didn't know his wife

35:12.414 --> 35:15.504
was having an affair with
the victim. Maybe he was lying.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.115
What about his alibi?

35:17.202 --> 35:18.725
He alibi'alibieded out
for the 1:00 a.m. shooting

35:18.812 --> 35:20.553
but a blow to the head would
have occurred earlier.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.729
It's like watching a symphony
orchestra come together.

35:22.816 --> 35:24.818
[dramatic music]

35:28.038 --> 35:30.084
[Teresa]
'Dead River Bridge.'

35:32.565 --> 35:34.044
Sean Meyers'
cell phone server

35:34.132 --> 35:36.003
got a fix on his signal
somewhere around here.

35:36.090 --> 35:37.483
Why would he come out here?

35:37.570 --> 35:39.137
Van Pelt talked
to the apartment manager.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.661
He heard a couple fighting.
Betsy got in her car.

35:41.748 --> 35:44.054
Sean took off after her.
She could be his next victim.

35:45.447 --> 35:47.101
Well, that's one theory.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.450
[Betsy]
'Get back!'

35:48.537 --> 35:49.799
[Sean]
'Betsy!'

35:49.886 --> 35:50.844
Stay away from me!

35:51.975 --> 35:52.933
Okay.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.066
[dramatic music]

35:57.981 --> 36:00.245
We're with the CBI.
What's going on here?

36:00.332 --> 36:02.464
Oh, they were up there
when we arrived.

36:02.551 --> 36:03.813
'Can't tell yet.'

36:03.900 --> 36:06.860
'It looks like
an attempted assault.'

36:06.947 --> 36:09.123
He's gonna reach her soon.

36:09.210 --> 36:12.518
We may have to shoot
to stop him.

36:12.605 --> 36:13.562
Get back!

36:13.649 --> 36:14.563
Stay away from me!

36:21.048 --> 36:22.354
Betsy!

36:22.441 --> 36:24.138
If you shoot him,
you'll have two victims.

36:24.225 --> 36:26.053
She just went up there
to see about jumping.

36:26.140 --> 36:29.056
He's trying to save her.

36:29.143 --> 36:30.144
Can I use that?

36:33.321 --> 36:34.627
[beeps]

36:34.714 --> 36:36.324
Uh, Betsy?

36:39.371 --> 36:43.026
If you're gonna jump,
make sure to dive, headfirst.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.593
- Hey.
- Jane.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.029
From that height,
you'll just shatter bones

36:46.116 --> 36:47.988
and suffer
massive internal injuries.

36:48.075 --> 36:50.556
Make sure you dive, headfirst.

36:52.079 --> 36:53.950
[instrumental music]

36:55.430 --> 36:57.911
I just want this all
to end now!

36:57.998 --> 36:59.652
I know.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.654
What do I have to live for?

37:01.741 --> 37:03.221
Um, nothing.

37:03.308 --> 37:06.398
Your husband killed Henry Dahl.
He's going to prison.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.661
[dramatic music]

37:10.184 --> 37:12.578
You killed Henry?

37:12.665 --> 37:14.493
He was gonna hurt you.

37:14.580 --> 37:16.103
You did that for me, baby?

37:18.932 --> 37:21.543
[panting]

37:23.545 --> 37:25.112
Oh!

37:25.199 --> 37:28.246
- Ohh.
- I got you.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.118
Ah, ain't love grand?

37:31.205 --> 37:32.162
Thank you.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.341
Yeah, she was
never gonna jump anyway.

37:36.428 --> 37:37.951
She just wanted the attention.

37:43.435 --> 37:47.090
I found the e-mails
on her laptop two weeks ago.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.701
My entire world fell apart.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.226
I couldn't lose Betsy.
I just couldn't.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.491
When Henry got out of prison
I went to the motel

37:56.578 --> 37:57.840
but I went to talkwith him.

37:59.451 --> 38:00.669
[Henry]
'I'm a free man now.'

38:03.193 --> 38:04.456
'Means free to love, too.'

38:05.718 --> 38:07.023
She's married.

38:07.110 --> 38:10.070
I'll share her with you.
I don't mind.

38:11.332 --> 38:12.986
You learn to share..

38:13.073 --> 38:14.988
...in lockdown.

38:15.075 --> 38:17.295
Where are
my damn cigarettes?

38:17.382 --> 38:19.209
I'll pay you.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.081
I'll give you money
to stay away from Betsy.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.996
How much?

38:23.083 --> 38:24.737
I have 3,200 saved.

38:24.824 --> 38:26.434
[laughing]

38:26.521 --> 38:28.175
I've got millions
coming my way

38:28.262 --> 38:30.395
once the state reimburses me
for all that time in jail.

38:31.961 --> 38:32.919
Sorry.

38:34.877 --> 38:36.792
I plan on having a little fun
with your wife.

38:38.925 --> 38:40.753
'Maybe I'll..'

38:40.840 --> 38:41.797
...slash her throat..

38:43.146 --> 38:44.365
Like I did the last one.

38:45.279 --> 38:48.021
[dramatic music]

38:48.108 --> 38:49.370
Damn,
where are those cigarettes?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.288
[grunts]

38:58.684 --> 39:00.860
I just wanted
to protect her.

39:00.947 --> 39:03.428
This is all my fault.
I'm so sorry.

39:06.518 --> 39:07.693
Alright, time to go.

39:13.612 --> 39:14.700
I'll write you every day.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.359
I suppose, from your perspective

39:21.446 --> 39:23.926
it's a shame that neither man
will serve any real time.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.275
Oh, will they not?

39:25.363 --> 39:28.104
Well, who knows who really
killed Henry Dahl?

39:28.191 --> 39:30.193
Well, prosecution
will say Sean Meyers.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.240
- He struck him in the head.
- Ah, but did he kill him?

39:33.327 --> 39:34.981
Max may well have lied
to protect himself.

39:35.068 --> 39:37.505
Maybe Dahl was still alive.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.594
Max's attorneys
point the finger at Sean

39:39.681 --> 39:42.031
and Sean's attorneys
point at Max

39:42.118 --> 39:45.557
and in the end, they both walk.
Yep, that could happen.

39:45.644 --> 39:48.124
Ah, maybe we could save everyone
a lot of time and money

39:48.211 --> 39:49.865
and let 'em both walk now.

39:49.952 --> 39:52.302
After all, the killer
did get what he deserved.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.478
That's common sense.

39:55.436 --> 39:58.831
But, uh, common sense
carries very little weight

39:58.918 --> 40:00.049
in the DA's office.

40:01.660 --> 40:02.574
Pity.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.316
[instrumental music]

40:08.797 --> 40:10.973
- What you doing there, Rigsby?
- Nothing.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.627
He's trying to light the candle
with the power of his mind.

40:12.714 --> 40:13.846
No, I wasn't.

40:13.933 --> 40:14.934
Is that one of those
candles Jane used

40:15.021 --> 40:16.283
on the talk show?

40:16.370 --> 40:18.154
- Look, I know how he did that.
- Oh, yeah?

40:18.241 --> 40:21.114
A candlewick dipped in liquid
phosphorous will spontaneously

40:21.201 --> 40:24.465
burst into flame when it dries.
The oxygen hits the phosphorous.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.119
Jane must've dipped
the kid's candle in the stuff

40:26.206 --> 40:28.426
before he gave it to him.
Now the real trick, though..

40:28.513 --> 40:30.602
...is in the timing,
which Jane nailed.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.647
Hey. Where are we going
for lunch today?

40:32.734 --> 40:34.954
- 'Napa.'
- 'Nice.'

40:35.041 --> 40:36.216
Bye, guys.

40:36.303 --> 40:38.523
[instrumental music]

40:47.401 --> 40:50.360
Uh, excuse me, Patrick.
I was looking for you.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.711
It seems they're gonna drop
the attempted murder charge.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.843
The, uh, evidence tampering
is another matter

40:54.930 --> 40:57.237
but my attorney's gonna
work out a deal for probation.

40:57.324 --> 40:59.413
Well, that's-that's
very good for Jackson.

40:59.500 --> 41:02.503
Yeah. I'm told that somebody
high up in your office

41:02.590 --> 41:05.593
was very influential
with the DA.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.943
Mm. Wasn't me.
Good to see you.

41:08.030 --> 41:09.945
Yeah. But I brought
you a gift anyway.

41:10.032 --> 41:12.774
Oh, listen, thank you,
but I-I can't--

41:12.861 --> 41:15.298
Please? Please.

41:16.256 --> 41:17.213
Okay.

41:18.867 --> 41:20.739
- Should I open it now?
- No.

41:20.826 --> 41:22.871
[dramatic music]

41:26.962 --> 41:28.834
Was it worth it?

41:28.921 --> 41:30.444
Was what worth it?

41:30.531 --> 41:33.708
The man that killed
your wife no longer exists.

41:33.795 --> 41:35.623
The time you took pursuing him.

41:37.016 --> 41:40.933
The pain, the sacrifice,
was it worth it?

41:41.020 --> 41:42.282
Yes, it was.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.157
Thank you.
