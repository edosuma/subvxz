WEBVTT

00:04.059 --> 00:05.689
Gordon teaches history.

00:05.689 --> 00:07.110
- Where do you teach?
- Des Moines.

00:07.110 --> 00:08.940
We're looking
for a change of pace.

00:08.940 --> 00:11.280
There is a lot of history
in this town...

00:11.280 --> 00:12.650
Not all of it good.

00:15.030 --> 00:16.700
We knew your father.

00:16.700 --> 00:18.490
You're Henry Deaver, aren't you?

00:18.490 --> 00:19.910
What's in the basement?

00:19.910 --> 00:22.540
Don't make me
call the state police.

00:22.540 --> 00:23.920
You're lagging.
Let's go.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.210
Which way do you think it is, son?

00:25.210 --> 00:26.290
Your father called it...

00:26.290 --> 00:29.750
The Voice of God.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.880
Inside this chamber
is total silence...

00:31.880 --> 00:34.220
Perhaps the only total silence on Earth.

00:34.220 --> 00:36.720
Hey!

00:36.720 --> 00:39.180
Something terrible
is going to happen.

00:39.180 --> 00:42.020
You haven't aged one day,

00:42.020 --> 00:44.890
not for 27 years.

00:44.890 --> 00:48.310
The reason, the stain...

00:48.310 --> 00:49.770
The curse on our town.

00:49.770 --> 00:51.070
Suspected arson

00:51.070 --> 00:52.780
at Juniper Hills Hospital.

00:52.780 --> 00:55.410
Police have released a photo,
but not a name.

00:55.410 --> 00:57.910
Dragging evil behind you
everywhere you went.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.410
And after all these years...

01:07.540 --> 01:09.500
I still don't know
what you really are.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074

01:18.300 --> 01:20.390
The fundamental problem

01:20.390 --> 01:22.810
is that repression
has become a dirty word,

01:22.810 --> 01:25.730
when it is, in fact,
a crucial Darwinian tool.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.310
The human mind is expressly designed

01:28.310 --> 01:30.230
to forget much of its past suffering,

01:30.230 --> 01:33.070
as the body is designed
to heal its wounds.

01:33.070 --> 01:36.030
Yes, but don't
the evolutionary psychologists

01:36.030 --> 01:39.410
want to have their
heuristic cake and eat it, too?

01:39.410 --> 01:42.120
Surely you're not suggesting
that we ignore

01:42.120 --> 01:43.910
the lessons of history?

01:43.910 --> 01:46.460
Huxley and Rogers
have empirically demonstrated

01:46.460 --> 01:48.710
that fetishizing cultural memories

01:48.710 --> 01:51.630
is both dangerous and foolhardy.

01:51.630 --> 01:54.380
Well...

01:54.380 --> 01:56.130
then perhaps I'm a fool...

01:56.130 --> 01:59.720
but a fool with tenure.

02:02.510 --> 02:05.270
But...

02:05.270 --> 02:08.690
you know what
I just can't forget?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.570
That you fucked my wife.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.050
Wow.

02:38.050 --> 02:39.840
It's certainly beautiful country.

02:51.520 --> 02:55.190
There's no Masshole
summer tourists in Castle Rock.

02:55.190 --> 02:57.400
The average cost of a three-bedroom

02:57.400 --> 03:00.200
is 39% lower than the next zip code over,

03:00.200 --> 03:02.990
and as soon as Main Street
is redeveloped,

03:02.990 --> 03:05.620
property values are gonna
shoot through the roof!

03:05.620 --> 03:08.580
Which, by the way, was just
re-shingled last year.

03:08.580 --> 03:12.250
Would they consider including the art?

03:19.470 --> 03:20.550
- You're good.
- More.

03:20.550 --> 03:21.880
All right.

03:21.880 --> 03:22.970
More, more, more, more, more.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.470
- Down here?
- There.

03:24.470 --> 03:25.850
All right, got it.

03:44.070 --> 03:46.740
Widow said he made
hundreds of paintings.

03:46.740 --> 03:48.580
Wonder where
the rest of them are.

04:10.930 --> 04:12.770
Oh, hey, I found
the key to the basement!

04:41.300 --> 04:42.720
Gordon?

05:39.400 --> 05:41.070
You comin' up?

05:42.530 --> 05:44.400
Yeah, five minutes.

05:46.610 --> 05:50.530
I thought we could, um...

05:50.530 --> 05:51.990
give it a shot?

06:03.880 --> 06:05.970
Can't we just say
it never happened?

06:08.760 --> 06:10.470
I'm trying.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.610
Castle Rock Historic B&B.
Can I help you?

06:24.190 --> 06:25.280
Absolutely.

06:27.150 --> 06:29.280
OK, great. Bye-bye.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.740
Gordon.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.750
We got a booking.

06:38.870 --> 06:43.380
The murder capital of 1991.
Can you believe that?

06:43.380 --> 06:46.460
Gordon has always been
interested in the macabre.

06:46.460 --> 06:49.220
He did his Ph. D. Work
on the BTK Killer.

06:49.220 --> 06:51.840
Well, uh...
sociological analysis.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.890
Nothing too juicy, I'm afraid.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.480
We believe this to be
the first fully immersive

06:58.480 --> 07:01.190
lodging experience
of historical integrity

07:01.190 --> 07:03.610
for the true crime aficionado.

07:03.610 --> 07:06.030
A chance to stay in a house

07:06.030 --> 07:09.860
where actual murders
have been recreated

07:09.860 --> 07:12.070
in exquisite detail.

07:12.070 --> 07:15.700
And as we acquire
more properties around town,

07:15.700 --> 07:20.160
we think Castle Rock
could be a unique destination.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.670
Yup. For young people
who, um, will like this.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.930
How long have you been married?

07:32.930 --> 07:36.010
- Uh, 13 years.
- It's, uh, two for me.

07:42.770 --> 07:46.190
So, uh, the tour tomorrow,
we could...

07:46.190 --> 07:48.860
Oh, that's OK, we'll probably
be getting out of here early.

07:50.900 --> 07:55.450
Uh, we just needed
a sleepy little town, so...

07:55.450 --> 07:56.740
I see. Yeah.

08:05.290 --> 08:06.630
Thank you.

08:09.170 --> 08:10.300
Mmm.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.090
Gordon?

09:03.390 --> 09:04.560
Gordon?

11:03.430 --> 11:04.560
Aah!

11:10.810 --> 11:13.940
Henry!

11:16.030 --> 11:18.440
It's Molly.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.950
Henry. It's me, OK?

11:34.340 --> 11:36.630
Come on.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.380
Where are those men?

11:38.380 --> 11:39.630
I don't know.

12:05.700 --> 12:09.620
They really just
locked you in there and left?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.710
Were you in there with me?

12:15.710 --> 12:17.590
Is that how you found me?

12:19.210 --> 12:20.920
Kind of. It...

12:23.130 --> 12:25.430
I don't know.

12:25.430 --> 12:27.220
It was confusing.

12:28.470 --> 12:30.140
I know it was only a few hours,

12:30.140 --> 12:32.730
but it felt like... years.

12:34.650 --> 12:37.360
I thought I knew
how the world worked.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.230
What was real and what's not.

12:46.530 --> 12:48.120
I sound crazy.

12:51.290 --> 12:54.790
People have been calling me
crazy my whole life.

12:54.790 --> 12:56.960
You get used to it.

13:07.890 --> 13:09.180
I'm sorry.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.440
You're not crazy.

14:00.730 --> 14:03.150
Front door open.

14:38.730 --> 14:39.850
Wendell?

14:52.280 --> 14:53.240
Mom?

15:26.020 --> 15:27.610
Wendell?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.530
What are you doing here?

15:36.370 --> 15:37.830
Where's my son?

15:45.340 --> 15:46.670
He's not here.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.670
Where is he?

15:54.340 --> 15:56.720
Front door open.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.230
Wendell.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.310
- You aight?
- Yeah.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.090
He's still here?

16:12.490 --> 16:15.190
Go upstairs. Lock the door.
Don't come out till I say so.

16:15.190 --> 16:16.080
What do you mean, "go upstairs"?

16:16.080 --> 16:17.240
- What's wrong?
- Go upstairs.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.160
- Dad...
- Lock the door. Now.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.080
- Is Grandma OK?
- Go.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.430
Back door open.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.700
Where you going?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.790
You shouldn't be here.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.880
What did you do?

17:55.760 --> 17:57.470
She was afraid.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.550
Confused.

18:00.550 --> 18:02.890
She killed him.

18:02.890 --> 18:05.310
I cleaned up.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.980
If we take the body
into the woods...

18:06.980 --> 18:08.770
What are you talking about?

18:08.770 --> 18:10.310
We have to protect her.

18:16.150 --> 18:18.860
Do you hear it?

18:26.330 --> 18:27.830
You do?

18:30.170 --> 18:31.540
Finally.

18:33.130 --> 18:35.550
We have to go.
We have to go to the woods.

18:35.550 --> 18:37.800
Who are you?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.840
Why did you ask for me?

18:42.850 --> 18:46.220
I waited for you.

18:46.220 --> 18:50.060
I waited for 27 years.

18:50.060 --> 18:52.150
Maine State Police.

18:52.150 --> 18:53.610
Come out if you're in there.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.480
I rescued you from that basement,

18:55.480 --> 18:56.990
and I didn't ask for any of this.

19:02.870 --> 19:06.700
Come out now!
This is your last warning.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.370
Copy that, dispatch.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.880
Hands up.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.560
According to authorities,

20:12.560 --> 20:13.900
several other suspects

20:13.900 --> 20:15.400
in addition to the John Doe

20:15.400 --> 20:17.440
just released from Shawshank Prison

20:17.440 --> 20:20.240
may have been involved in
the disaster at Juniper Hill.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.200
CCTV footage revealed multiple patients

20:23.200 --> 20:26.320
lighting their mattresses
on fire around the same time.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.740
These residents had
no known history of arson...

20:42.670 --> 20:45.890
Lilith.

20:45.890 --> 20:49.010
I don't know what came over me.
I'm not a murderer.

20:49.010 --> 20:51.220
I jus... I... I don't...

20:53.480 --> 20:55.350
It never happened.

21:02.490 --> 21:03.610
Oh, shit.

21:05.820 --> 21:07.820
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- OK, calm down.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.080
Hello?

21:14.750 --> 21:17.130
- Hello.
- Hi there.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.760
Wow. Look at this place.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.590
Uh, can we help you?

21:24.590 --> 21:26.130
Oh, sorry. I'm Jackie.

21:26.130 --> 21:30.100
Uh... Sweet Chariot Taxi.

21:30.100 --> 21:33.180
Saw your website, was thinkin'
maybe we could help each other.

21:33.180 --> 21:37.310
Excuse me just a second.
I need to...

21:37.310 --> 21:39.730
You know, like I'd talk you
guys up with my fares,

21:39.730 --> 21:41.610
and I'd be "supes" appreciative

21:41.610 --> 21:45.820
if you thought of me with
your guests, so boy...

21:45.820 --> 21:47.160
howdy.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.240
What have we here?

21:49.240 --> 21:50.450
Um...

21:56.210 --> 21:58.420
Gotta be honest...

21:58.420 --> 22:00.040
kind of makes me kick myself,

22:00.040 --> 22:04.420
because... no shit...
I had this idea five years ago.

22:04.420 --> 22:07.630
Like, turn this town
into a murder theme park.

22:07.630 --> 22:10.930
And now with the warden,
plus his friend in the cage,

22:10.930 --> 22:13.600
never mind Juniper Hill,
this place is a gold mine.

22:13.600 --> 22:17.100
But hey, you guys got here first, so...

22:17.100 --> 22:18.480
respect.

22:19.810 --> 22:22.650
Johnny Carrick, 1929.

22:22.650 --> 22:25.110
Uh, yeah. Rather obscure.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.740
Not to me.

22:26.740 --> 22:29.740
His cousin lost it all
in the stock market crash,

22:29.740 --> 22:33.120
and Johnny here
refused to help him. Tsk.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.170
That is a felling axe.

22:39.170 --> 22:42.750
It's not a fire axe.
Carrick was a fireman.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.050
You know your axes.

22:46.050 --> 22:49.260
- Um, Ms...?
- Torrance.

22:49.260 --> 22:51.890
Jackie. It's on the card.

22:51.890 --> 22:53.930
Right, yeah. Well,

22:53.930 --> 22:56.180
it turns out we got
a big group coming in tonight,

22:56.180 --> 22:59.480
- so we kinda need to...
- Absolutely! Um...

22:59.480 --> 23:04.150
Hey, if you need a volunteer,
like a docent or anything,

23:04.150 --> 23:06.190
I do a lot of... OK.

23:06.190 --> 23:09.110
Uh, well, nice to meet ya.

23:09.110 --> 23:10.360
You, too.

24:47.590 --> 24:49.210
You and him were close?

24:56.090 --> 24:58.050
He took care of your grandmother.

24:58.050 --> 24:59.510
For a long time.

25:03.940 --> 25:06.020
Tried to be a good man.

25:08.450 --> 25:10.120
Sometimes he was.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.490
Grandma told me to leave.

25:22.060 --> 25:24.090
I didn't know where to go.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.010
I shouldn't have left you two alone.

25:33.010 --> 25:35.300
Where were you last night?

25:36.590 --> 25:37.970
I...

25:37.970 --> 25:39.800
I had to do something.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.350
I slept in one of the
pews at Grandpa's church.

25:46.600 --> 25:49.460
This is fucked up, Dad.

25:49.460 --> 25:50.900
Henry?

26:29.520 --> 26:32.150
I wanted to talk to you.

26:32.150 --> 26:35.740
Explain what I did before
they take me away.

26:35.740 --> 26:38.110
He was comin' at me.

26:38.110 --> 26:41.490
I tried to hide, but he found me
out in the shed.

26:41.490 --> 26:43.700
I had no choice.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.620
I was scared, Henry.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.580
He scared me.

26:51.580 --> 26:53.290
You know what he can be like.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.010
Wait, Mom, what are you...

26:56.010 --> 26:57.260
What are you talkin' about?

26:57.260 --> 26:59.430
It's hard for you, of course,

26:59.430 --> 27:01.050
but you do know.

27:01.050 --> 27:02.930
The way he treated you.

27:02.930 --> 27:05.060
I was scared for you,
scared he was gonna hurt you.

27:05.060 --> 27:06.240
- Mom, who?
- And I didn't protect you.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.890
I should have, I know,
but I didn't,

27:07.890 --> 27:11.310
because he was
not in his right mind.

27:12.260 --> 27:13.610
- Dad?
- I don't know

27:13.610 --> 27:16.780
how he came back, but he did.

27:16.780 --> 27:19.570
Only I stood up to him
this time,

27:19.570 --> 27:20.860
like I should have before.

27:20.860 --> 27:23.200
I protected you.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.580
And your boy.

27:25.580 --> 27:28.620
You'll help me, won't you?
Explain everything?

27:28.620 --> 27:31.960
You'll help me get them to see
that I had no choice.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.500
Find Alan.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.550
He knows these men.

27:36.550 --> 27:39.420
They trust him.

27:39.420 --> 27:41.510
He can talk to them.

27:43.550 --> 27:45.720
Find Alan.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.350
Suspect is Caucasian,

27:47.350 --> 27:49.020
approximately six-foot-four,
mid-twenties,

27:49.020 --> 27:50.520
wearing a plaid overcoat.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.350
He is considered armed and dangerous.

27:54.860 --> 27:57.860
But he was your client, right?

27:57.860 --> 27:59.320
- You know he was.
- Yet somehow

27:59.320 --> 28:02.030
you never even got a first name.

28:02.030 --> 28:03.030
No.

28:03.030 --> 28:05.490
And he never said a word
about Juniper Hill?

28:09.200 --> 28:11.710
Fourteen dead, another five missing.

28:11.710 --> 28:13.580
Maybe next time
you'll think twice before

28:13.580 --> 28:16.040
you spring a lunatic from prison.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.630
Maybe prison is what
turned him into a lunatic.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.930
Your mother's still confused
about what happened.

28:22.930 --> 28:24.760
I'll circle back tomorrow
and talk with her again.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.800
Only with me present.

28:32.390 --> 28:35.810
- What?
- You don't remember me, do you?

28:35.810 --> 28:37.400
Daria Reese. My daughter,

28:37.400 --> 28:39.360
she went to Castle Rock High with you.
Dana.

28:39.360 --> 28:41.610
- I was on the PTA.
- I'm sorry.

28:41.610 --> 28:44.570
It's OK, but who could forget you, right?

28:44.570 --> 28:48.080
What was the name that
the kids used to call you?

28:48.080 --> 28:50.290
- The Black Death?
- Are we done?

28:50.290 --> 28:53.330
And here you are,
back in town not two weeks

28:53.330 --> 28:56.630
and there's another dead guy
in your house.

28:56.630 --> 29:00.090
Shawshank, too. Heard that CO
popped all the guards

29:00.090 --> 29:02.760
was gonna be your star witness,
you were there when it happened.

29:02.760 --> 29:05.470
You're like a fuckin' lightning rod.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.050
What is your badge number?

29:15.770 --> 29:17.650
I'll be in touch.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.820
Hey, hey.

29:20.820 --> 29:23.320
Come here.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.360
Let's go.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.740
What was she asking you about?

29:25.740 --> 29:28.240
What was she asking you about?

29:28.240 --> 29:30.080
Dad, tell me.

29:35.830 --> 29:38.500
This place is messed up.

29:38.500 --> 29:40.750
It always has been. That's why
I never brought you here.

29:40.750 --> 29:41.920
I shouldn't have
brought you here now.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.210
Look, I heard
what Grandma said, all right?

29:43.210 --> 29:44.550
I was listening.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.340
All that...

29:46.340 --> 29:48.180
All that stuff about your dad?

29:48.180 --> 29:50.180
It kind of explained some things, you know?

29:50.180 --> 29:52.100
Yeah, what's it explain?

29:52.100 --> 29:53.980
Grandma's got dementia.

29:53.980 --> 29:56.060
And she's told me more
about you in one day

29:56.060 --> 29:57.940
than you have in my whole life.

30:00.060 --> 30:03.280
Wendell... hey.

30:03.280 --> 30:05.990
- We can talk about this.
- No, we can't, Dad.

30:05.990 --> 30:08.360
All right? You can't.

30:14.830 --> 30:17.750
I'm gonna come up to Boston
as soon as I get done here.

30:17.750 --> 30:21.130
And I'll stay
for a few weeks... or longer.

30:21.130 --> 30:23.960
Then let's go home now.
Together.

30:27.590 --> 30:28.890
Please.

30:32.430 --> 30:33.850
I wish I could. I just...

30:33.850 --> 30:35.640
Can't get away?

30:35.640 --> 30:37.060
Right?

30:39.480 --> 30:41.150
I just need a few days.

30:43.690 --> 30:44.820
Yeah.

31:06.510 --> 31:08.590
Henry, it's Molly.

31:08.590 --> 31:10.930
I heard about Sheriff Pangborn.

31:10.930 --> 31:12.100
I'm so sorry.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.760
Call me when you can. Please.

31:33.530 --> 31:35.200
Jeez!

31:35.200 --> 31:37.540
Come on. Another one.

32:20.870 --> 32:23.210
Everywhere this guy goes,
people die.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.420
Juniper Hill,

32:26.420 --> 32:29.010
Shawshank Warden Lacy, now Alan.

32:29.010 --> 32:32.050
He doesn't do
those things himself,

32:32.050 --> 32:35.550
it's like... it's like...

32:35.550 --> 32:37.720
other people do it for him.

32:37.720 --> 32:40.430
He pushes them somehow.

32:43.520 --> 32:44.980
I don't know.

32:48.610 --> 32:51.280
I've never felt anything like it

32:51.280 --> 32:53.200
when I was near him.

32:54.410 --> 32:56.530
He said he waited for me.

32:56.530 --> 32:59.160
That he rescued me from a basement

32:59.160 --> 33:01.620
and waited for me for 27 years.

33:09.630 --> 33:11.840
Can I ask you a crazy question?

33:11.840 --> 33:13.130
Of course.

33:13.130 --> 33:16.640
You saw Lacy's house, right?

33:16.640 --> 33:18.600
Did you ever go down to his basement?

33:20.560 --> 33:23.180
The widow said
she couldn't find the key.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.640
I waited for you.

36:53.020 --> 36:56.110
I waited for 27 years.

39:12.410 --> 39:14.580
This is Henry Deaver,
I'm away from my phone.

39:14.580 --> 39:16.370
Please leave a message
after the tone.

39:16.370 --> 39:18.370
Hi. Henry.

39:18.370 --> 39:22.000
Um, it's me, I'm coming over.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.380
I just can't
be alone right now, OK?

39:31.720 --> 39:34.560
Can I help you?

39:37.850 --> 39:40.270
Uh...

39:40.270 --> 39:42.230
I'm sorry.

39:46.780 --> 39:49.990
I knocked. Uh... but...

39:49.990 --> 39:53.740
I'm a lawyer,
and a man I represent is...

39:55.120 --> 39:56.990
Well, your paintings...

39:59.330 --> 40:01.670
You know, I should just leave.

40:07.550 --> 40:09.880
Yeah. I think you'd better.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.600
Aah! Aah! Aah!

40:25.400 --> 40:26.480
Aw, fuck!

40:30.320 --> 40:32.450
Stop it!

40:32.450 --> 40:33.780
Get off!

40:33.780 --> 40:36.160
Unh!

40:36.160 --> 40:37.620
- Aah!
- Oh, God!

40:50.170 --> 40:52.340
Aah.

43:06.810 --> 43:08.770
I mean, they were just so creepy.

43:08.770 --> 43:11.560
Something...

43:11.560 --> 43:13.110
seemed off,

43:13.110 --> 43:16.240
so I drove by again
'cause I was like...

43:16.240 --> 43:19.950
Well, yeah, I mean,
I guess I was snooping.

43:29.960 --> 43:33.000
I wasn't myself anymore, you know?

43:43.720 --> 43:45.350
What the fuck?

44:34.560 --> 44:36.820
What...

44:36.820 --> 44:39.190
What are you doing here?

44:45.490 --> 44:47.450
Where's Henry?

44:49.950 --> 44:52.290
I don't think he's ready yet.

44:54.790 --> 44:55.880
Ready.

44:57.130 --> 44:58.500
Ready for what?

44:59.920 --> 45:01.720
But you can help me.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.930
Because you know me.

45:09.810 --> 45:11.890
I don't know anything about you.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.310
You do.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.400
And I know you.

45:23.950 --> 45:25.450
Your parents.

45:27.160 --> 45:29.280
They had a television in there.

45:31.500 --> 45:33.870
Sometimes they'd let you stay up late

45:33.870 --> 45:36.500
and watch movies with them.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.170
And you'd sit a lot

45:38.170 --> 45:41.460
by the window in there...

45:41.460 --> 45:43.630
in a big chair...

45:43.630 --> 45:45.760
listening to your music.

45:56.600 --> 45:59.190
- Hello?
- Henry, it's Reverend Appleton.

45:59.190 --> 46:02.780
Your mother just came to
the church and seemed confused.

46:02.780 --> 46:04.440
- She asked me if...
- Wait, when?

46:04.440 --> 46:06.240
Sheriff Pangborn was alive
or dead this time.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.860
- Where is she now?
- I tried to take her home,

46:07.860 --> 46:09.280
but she left in a hurry.

46:09.280 --> 46:11.330
She seemed very disoriented.

46:11.330 --> 46:12.830
I'm a little worried
about where she went...

46:15.580 --> 46:17.920
Henry? Henry?

46:24.660 --> 46:26.470
Suspect has left the area.

46:26.470 --> 46:27.950
I thought you were watching him!

47:11.470 --> 47:14.060
You painted your nails with Wite-Out.

47:17.930 --> 47:20.400
And your bed was over here.

47:25.480 --> 47:28.740
And your desk was over here.

47:28.740 --> 47:30.610
And you had a flashlight.

47:33.490 --> 47:35.580
And you shined it
up at the hill.

47:45.050 --> 47:47.340
H-How do you know all of this?

47:50.430 --> 47:52.470
I was there.

48:19.080 --> 48:21.870
Out there... in the woods.

48:25.420 --> 48:26.880
That's where you died.

50:25.660 --> 50:27.250
Bad Robot!
