<i>Previously on "Smallville"...</i>

00:04.651 --> 00:08.304
You ran off with a girl
you barely know and got married.

00:08.322 --> 00:11.063
It wasn't legal.
I was on red Kryptonite, mom.

00:11.064 --> 00:12.773
Jason, what's really going on here?

00:12.774 --> 00:15.290
Where this is heading with us,
I just don't think you're ready.

00:15.291 --> 00:20.027
There's a part of me that never feels freer
than when I'm with Alicia.

00:20.028 --> 00:24.012
You know what she did. She tried
to kill Lana, and she tried to kill you.

00:24.013 --> 00:25.745
Alicia needs to be in an institution.

00:25.746 --> 00:27.135
Why'd they let her out of Belle Reve?

00:27.136 --> 00:30.779
A little something my doctor came up with.
It keeps me from using my powers.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.209
Why did you just walk out
on this relationship?

00:33.210 --> 00:34.862
I think that my mother arranged it.

00:34.863 --> 00:37.056
You don't even see
what you did was wrong!

00:37.057 --> 00:38.933
You dosed me with red Kryptonite!

00:38.934 --> 00:42.033
Look, I know that we can never be
together after what I did.

00:42.034 --> 00:45.848
Whatever's going on, it doesn't change
the way that I feel about you.

00:45.849 --> 00:51.004

That was subtle, Lois.
Right. Good.

02:14.911 --> 02:16.624
Lana, wait.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.282
- I just want to apologize.
- For what?

02:22.283 --> 02:24.789
Trying to kill me or not succeeding?

02:24.790 --> 02:28.805
Look, all I want is a chance
to prove to you who I really am.

02:28.806 --> 02:31.164
You already have.

02:37.822 --> 02:40.082
- I can't believe you brought her here.
- Jason, listen...

02:40.083 --> 02:42.701
listen to what... another apology?

02:43.099 --> 02:44.344
You think just 'cause she says

02:44.348 --> 02:46.458
she's better that everything's
going to be okay?

02:47.884 --> 02:49.273
Come on, man.

04:09.589 --> 04:10.801
Lana?

04:18.404 --> 04:19.519
Lana?

04:24.605 --> 04:25.719
Hey.

04:28.161 --> 04:29.483
Lana?

04:30.174 --> 04:32.193
Hey, can you hear me?

04:37.466 --> 04:38.580
Lana.

04:39.158 --> 04:40.483
Lana, look at me.

Original Airdate Feb. 2, 2005

05:45.636 --> 05:47.370
How is Lana?
Is she okay?

05:47.371 --> 05:49.616
Hey, Clark, yeah,
she's... she's fine.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.302
I mean, lucky for her,
Jason pulled a

05:51.305 --> 05:53.160
T.J. Hooker and broke her
bathroom door down.

05:53.171 --> 05:54.776
Only to discover
that Lana's mystery

05:54.785 --> 05:57.044
assailant had somehow
flown the coop.

05:57.450 --> 06:00.826
So, have they arrested
your arm ornament yet?

06:01.004 --> 06:02.156
What?

06:02.157 --> 06:04.537
Sheriff Adams was just here,
and she spent a lot of time

06:04.542 --> 06:07.557
focusing on the "attacked
in a locked room" scenario.

06:07.998 --> 06:09.463
And the name Alicia
Baker came up...

06:09.475 --> 06:12.004
more than once in a bunny
boiler kind of way.

06:12.429 --> 06:14.659
Alicia didn't do this.

06:14.660 --> 06:16.892
Ever since her release from
Belle Reve, she's been wearing

06:16.918 --> 06:19.218
a lead bracelet. It prevents
her from using her abilities.

06:19.224 --> 06:21.168
And did she also happen
to be wearing anything

06:21.194 --> 06:23.662
low-cut when she spun
you that tale, 'cause

06:23.663 --> 06:26.023
I'm not sure you're thinking
with your big brain here.

06:26.124 --> 06:28.847
Clark, just because Alicia
says that the bracelet keeps her

06:28.851 --> 06:31.776
from teleporting doesn't
mean that it's the truth.

06:32.247 --> 06:34.172
She was with me when
Lana got attacked.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.723
I was saying good
night in Grandville.

06:35.724 --> 06:38.319
Yeah, but every second?
You have to admit that

06:38.326 --> 06:41.191
she can transport easier
than captain Kirk.

06:41.293 --> 06:43.488
And she did try to carve
herself a jack-o-Lana

06:43.496 --> 06:45.746
before, cut and dry...
emphasis on the "cut."

06:45.847 --> 06:47.992
I'm telling you, Alicia
couldn't have done this.

06:48.018 --> 06:49.178
I know her.

07:02.067 --> 07:03.020
Clark...

07:04.544 --> 07:06.725
Lana doesn't want to see you.

07:13.705 --> 07:17.330
I'm getting a funny sense
of <i>"déjà vu"</i>  here, Mr. Kent.

07:17.397 --> 07:19.812
Haven't we acted out
this particular charade before?

07:19.813 --> 07:22.719
This is different, sheriff.
Alicia did not attack Lana.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.142
She was with me.

07:24.813 --> 07:28.689
I better not find out you're covering
for that girlfriend of yours, Mr. Kent.

07:28.690 --> 07:34.699
Having you as an alibi is the only thing
keeping me from tossing her tail in jail.

07:43.650 --> 07:46.372
Sheriff Adams already has
Alicia tried and convicted.

07:46.373 --> 07:48.019
Sheriff Adams has a point, Clark.

07:48.020 --> 07:51.803
First Las Vegas, and now an assault charge.
What are you doing with this girl, Clark?

07:51.804 --> 07:53.172
Alicia didn't do this.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.162
Son, your girlfriend
has problems, and this

07:55.188 --> 07:57.557
relationship is not healthy.
Why can't you see that?

07:57.558 --> 08:00.818
You always told me to look for
the good in people, to believe in them,

08:00.819 --> 08:02.680
and Alicia deserves a second chance.

08:02.681 --> 08:05.987
Why do you continue to see her
knowing how we feel?

08:05.988 --> 08:09.504
She kept my secret.
She got shot protecting me.

08:09.505 --> 08:11.766
What else does she have to do
to prove herself?

08:11.767 --> 08:13.627
What if she did this, Clark?

08:13.628 --> 08:17.570
What if she attacked Lana
the way she did before?

08:24.605 --> 08:26.932
Ever thought about getting out more?

08:27.067 --> 08:31.004
This coming from the hotshot college student
who ran away from college this weekend.

08:31.005 --> 08:33.049
- It's Greek week.
- So?

08:33.051 --> 08:37.466
So they're wearing their letters on their shirts,
they sing group songs...

08:37.467 --> 08:39.975
the fraternities are having
a power puking contest.

08:39.976 --> 08:41.635
Oh, okay. Enough said.

08:41.635 --> 08:44.696
I don't understand why you
came out to Smallville, though.

08:44.697 --> 08:47.579
Well, believe it or not,
I like spending time with you, little cousin.

08:47.797 --> 08:49.522
Although, that doesn't
mean I'm ready to buy

08:49.525 --> 08:51.579
into your "meteors
make freaks" theory.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.308
It's not just a theory, Lois.

08:53.334 --> 08:55.989
Alicia Baker tried to kill
my best friend twice,

08:55.990 --> 08:58.224
and it was because of
her meteor-induced abilities

08:58.250 --> 09:00.404
that she was able to do that.

09:00.405 --> 09:02.537
Did you know that Lana's
bathroom door was locked?

09:02.538 --> 09:05.137
Who else could've gotten in or out,
for that matter?

09:05.138 --> 09:06.783
That's what I want to know.

09:06.784 --> 09:08.587
Chloe, we need to find out
if there's anybody else

09:08.613 --> 09:10.460
in Smallville who has abilities
similar to Alicia's.

09:10.461 --> 09:13.008
Clark, I'm sorry, but even
if there was someone else

09:13.034 --> 09:15.314
like Alicia, what would
they have against Lana?

09:15.315 --> 09:18.514
Hey, I finished that op-ed piece, Chloe.

09:18.515 --> 09:19.613
Great.

09:19.638 --> 09:21.835
- Hey, Lois.
- Hi.

09:22.515 --> 09:25.899
I had a feeling I'd bump into you here. Um,

09:25.900 --> 09:29.652
I was wondering if, uh,
you'd like to maybe

09:29.653 --> 09:33.955
have a cup of coffee
or something with me, maybe.

09:33.956 --> 09:35.264
Coffee?

09:36.326 --> 09:39.863
You know, Lois was just saying
she needs to get out more.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.027
I... I... look

09:42.028 --> 09:43.812
excellent, it's a date.

09:43.813 --> 09:46.139
"Smallville's glory days."

09:47.844 --> 09:49.304
Sounds interesting.

09:49.305 --> 09:53.004
I think it is, and I'll tell you
about it over coffee.

09:55.305 --> 09:58.051
Hey, Tim, uh, you were
at the talon last night.

09:58.105 --> 10:00.150
Did you see anything...
suspicious?

10:00.231 --> 10:03.215
Um, no, nothing out of the ordinary.

10:03.216 --> 10:05.686
But your mother... she was there.
She was cleaning up,

10:05.712 --> 10:08.200
and the blond girl that you
were with was in the alley.

10:08.201 --> 10:10.349
Maybe they saw something.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.850
You look like a big cat in a small cage.

10:28.016 --> 10:29.923
You all right?

10:31.003 --> 10:32.263
No.

10:34.865 --> 10:37.325
Someone saw a blond girl

10:37.326 --> 10:40.865
in the alley behind the talon
when Lana was attacked.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.525
Then somebody saw
another blond girl in the alley,

10:48.535 --> 10:50.608
because it wasn't me.

10:53.300 --> 10:56.315
There's bound to be suspicion, Clark.

10:56.316 --> 10:58.690
People think I did it.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.161
Besides, you couldn't have done it,
because you were with me

11:03.162 --> 11:06.942
and you were wearing your bracelet.

11:15.557 --> 11:16.784
Clark.

11:16.803 --> 11:18.596
You lied to me.

11:22.388 --> 11:25.110
I didn't... I didn't lie.

11:25.111 --> 11:27.631
I didn't think I needed it.

11:28.065 --> 11:30.356
You don't understand.

11:30.357 --> 11:35.089
I couldn't give up my powers again.
It was worse than being in prison.

11:35.090 --> 11:39.743
What would you do if somebody told you
that you couldn't use your abilities?

11:39.828 --> 11:41.504
I don't know.

11:41.505 --> 11:43.322
But I would... I would
give them away in a

11:43.348 --> 11:45.181
second before I'd use
them to hurt someone.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.330
Yeah, so would I.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.048
I'm better now, Clark.
You know that.

11:51.049 --> 11:54.795
I just want people
to accept me for who I am.

11:54.796 --> 11:57.155
I think if you're honest with yourself,

11:57.156 --> 12:01.013
you'll realize that deep down inside,
you want that to.

12:02.509 --> 12:08.068
Look, I'm... so sorry that I didn't tell you
about the bracelet.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.085
But I didn't do anything to hurt Lana.

12:14.772 --> 12:16.452
I swear.

12:19.633 --> 12:21.085
I swear.

12:26.186 --> 12:29.877
Jason, don't be ridiculous.
I'll be fine for a few hours.

12:29.878 --> 12:32.328
You do realize that you were attacked
in your own apartment

12:32.329 --> 12:35.556
behind a locked door.
You want me just to leave you alone,

12:35.557 --> 12:38.592
and spend the evening digging through
the university's microfiche? No.

12:38.593 --> 12:42.429
Well, I am not going
to let you flunk history.

12:43.093 --> 12:45.532
Mom. Ready to go?

12:46.816 --> 12:49.659
Why don't Clark and I stay with Lana?

12:54.943 --> 12:58.286
I think that
that is a great idea.

13:00.235 --> 13:01.382
Go.

13:01.835 --> 13:03.692
I'll be fine.

13:04.635 --> 13:06.363
All right.

13:06.850 --> 13:08.547
I won't be long.

14:38.274 --> 14:38.993
Oh...

14:38.994 --> 14:40.871
Mom, what are you doing here?

14:41.271 --> 14:44.534
I had to come to make sure
my son was all right.

14:44.963 --> 14:47.900
I phoned Dr. Martin on the way here.
He can see you today.

14:47.901 --> 14:50.224
I'm fine. I've been hurt worse in football.

14:50.225 --> 14:53.147
Well, it never hurts to get a second opinion
from a real doctor.

14:53.148 --> 14:55.135
Let it go, mom.

14:55.379 --> 14:58.739
It's just hard to see you
suffering here by yourself.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.147
You'd at least think
your girlfriend would be here.

15:01.148 --> 15:02.685
You really want to play that game?

15:02.686 --> 15:06.030
This is not a game, Jason. This is your life.

15:06.255 --> 15:08.947
And I'm worried about the path
you're heading down.

15:08.948 --> 15:11.452
Oh, you mean the path you sent me down?

15:11.502 --> 15:13.537
What are you talking about?

15:14.317 --> 15:18.355
Lana... the girl you made sure
I met in Paris.

15:18.548 --> 15:20.758
Are you serious?

15:22.271 --> 15:28.328
How could anyone maneuver two people
meeting and falling in love in Paris?

15:29.582 --> 15:32.351
Mrs. Teague.
Um, I didn't know you were here.

15:32.352 --> 15:35.372
Come in, Lana.
We were just talking about you.

15:36.275 --> 15:40.954
Did, uh, Jason share
his matchmaking theory with you?

15:42.085 --> 15:43.284
Yeah, he did.

15:43.285 --> 15:46.407
And what did you think...
that I had somehow used my

15:46.408 --> 15:50.115
mysterious powers to coerce
you into going to Paris

15:50.141 --> 15:53.561
at exactly the same time
that my son was there?

15:53.997 --> 15:55.904
You don't have to answer that.

15:55.905 --> 15:58.021
I think she already has.

15:59.951 --> 16:01.066
Lana,

16:01.505 --> 16:04.227
I'm not a perfect mother. I can be...

16:04.228 --> 16:06.695
overprotective and
sometimes overbearing,

16:06.721 --> 16:09.750
especially when it comes
to women in my son's life.

16:09.751 --> 16:10.624
Mom?

16:10.628 --> 16:14.996
I had nothing to do
with getting the two of you together,

16:14.997 --> 16:17.596
as you can probably realize
from my reaction to it.

16:17.597 --> 16:21.393
And why my son
feels the need to blame me

16:21.612 --> 16:23.535
for meeting you...

16:24.012 --> 16:27.260
is something you should be asking yourself.

16:32.212 --> 16:35.208
If you change your mind about the doctor,
let me know.

16:36.295 --> 16:37.927
Feel better?

17:16.496 --> 17:18.789
It won't work.

17:20.250 --> 17:24.156
The one that they made me
at Belle Reve was special.

17:24.156 --> 17:26.958
It had to be able to
release trace amounts of

17:26.983 --> 17:29.941
lead into my bloodstream
to dampen my abilities.

17:29.942 --> 17:31.524
Remember?

17:32.480 --> 17:35.177
I guess it's the thought that counts.

17:36.295 --> 17:39.268
That's a pretty ugly cut.

17:39.372 --> 17:41.407
Where were you last night?

17:41.587 --> 17:45.238
I was wondering if you were
ever gonna call me again. Why?

17:46.619 --> 17:49.300
Lana's boyfriend was attacked.

17:50.465 --> 17:53.970
I was the one who saved him,
and I found this in his car.

17:54.219 --> 17:56.185
Okay, I didn't do it, Clark.

17:57.214 --> 18:00.316
I don't know how
that got there, but I...

18:00.506 --> 18:01.659
it wasn't me.

18:01.660 --> 18:04.164
Alicia, you have to turn yourself in.

18:04.383 --> 18:05.951
You don't believe me.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.582
I want to.

18:07.583 --> 18:10.705
I really do.
But I need to stop who's doing this.

18:10.706 --> 18:12.582
Okay, well, then find out
who really did it.

18:12.583 --> 18:15.662
- Everybody thinks it's you.
- Why, because of my powers?

18:15.663 --> 18:17.989
Because I'm a freak?

18:19.647 --> 18:21.674
You know what, Clark?
Maybe if everybody knew

18:21.685 --> 18:23.795
your secret, you'd be a suspect, too.

18:23.801 --> 18:26.269
No, Alicia, this is not about your abilities.

18:26.270 --> 18:28.730
That's really easy for you to say, Clark.

18:28.731 --> 18:30.869
Everybody thinks that you're normal.

18:30.870 --> 18:32.848
How do you think your
friends would react if

18:32.874 --> 18:34.869
they found out that you
were exactly like me?

18:34.870 --> 18:36.794
We'll just go to the sheriff.
We'll tell her what happened.

18:36.820 --> 18:37.628
We'll explain everything.

18:37.629 --> 18:40.731
She'll understand, and it'll all work out.

18:43.737 --> 18:45.530
Just explain it to her.

18:46.738 --> 18:49.000
All right, I'll go with you...

18:52.830 --> 18:56.013
if you tell her about your powers, too.

18:58.968 --> 19:00.697
I can't do that.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.306
Why not, Clark?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.552
Don't you understand that...

19:04.814 --> 19:08.231
once people know the truth
about us, then they'll

19:08.257 --> 19:11.058
have to accept us for
who we really are?

19:12.891 --> 19:14.290
I'm sorry.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.271
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

19:16.275 --> 19:18.367
Letting people know
about us is the only way

19:18.388 --> 19:20.939
that we're ever
gonna be free, Clark.

19:22.844 --> 19:25.751
Don't hate me for wanting that.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.522
Goodbye, Clark.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.220
Alicia...

19:56.291 --> 19:58.782
Mr. Kent, didn't see you there.

19:58.783 --> 20:00.738
Did you come to help your mother?

20:02.368 --> 20:05.690
Mmm, she has almost got
that latte machine down.

20:05.691 --> 20:08.276
No, sheriff, I came here to see you.

20:09.814 --> 20:13.837
I found this in the car
when Jason was attacked.

20:15.152 --> 20:17.059
It belongs to Alicia.

20:17.506 --> 20:20.249
You flip-flop more than a politician, Mr. Kent.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.497
So now you think
your girlfriend's guilty, huh?

20:23.635 --> 20:24.695
Maybe.

20:24.696 --> 20:27.218
Well, I hate to disappoint you, Mr. Kent,

20:27.219 --> 20:29.311
but I've already been
down that road.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.514
Despite your claim that
miss Baker was with

20:31.540 --> 20:33.466
you at the time of
the first incident,

20:33.467 --> 20:36.586
I yanked her in for a little dog-and-pony.

20:37.375 --> 20:40.751
The scarf may have been there,
but your girlfriend wasn't.

20:41.037 --> 20:44.015
Alicia Baker was locked
in an interrogation room

20:44.041 --> 20:47.175
with me at the time the
second victim was attacked.

20:47.176 --> 20:50.293
There's no way she could've done it.

21:20.511 --> 21:23.095
"Can any cell hold her?"

21:24.367 --> 21:26.290
Probably not.

21:27.428 --> 21:29.722
Alicia, what are you doing here?

21:30.382 --> 21:32.320
Chloe Sullivan...

21:32.351 --> 21:34.418
ace reporter.

21:34.705 --> 21:37.919
You write all these articles
about the people you call "freaks",

21:37.920 --> 21:41.876
and you don't even realize
that someone close to you is one of them.

21:42.089 --> 21:45.854
Why are you ignoring
what's right in front of your face, Chloe?

21:45.998 --> 21:48.841
Don't you want to know
the truth about Clark Kent?

21:49.887 --> 21:52.798
Everyone knows you're crazy.
Why should I believe you?

21:52.799 --> 21:56.413
You don't have to.
I'm gonna prove it.

21:56.414 --> 21:59.257
And then you can write
the story of a lifetime.

22:03.076 --> 22:05.351
Where are we?
What are you doing?

22:05.352 --> 22:10.230
Giving you your next headline...
and making things better for Clark.

22:15.594 --> 22:17.848
Clark, I'm on old blossom
road, and there's

22:17.874 --> 22:20.511
something really wrong with the car!
It won't stop!

22:20.512 --> 22:22.805
Just hurry!

22:24.002 --> 22:28.926
Once you see this, you'll understand.
And Clark can be who he really is,

22:28.927 --> 22:34.044
and you can use that poison pen of yours
to enlighten Smallville for a change.

22:42.846 --> 22:45.851
- Clark, what are you..?
- Don't worry, Chloe.

23:17.987 --> 23:19.958
Oh, my god.

23:29.319 --> 23:32.503
<i>Voilà</i>, Smallville... about 1988.

23:32.504 --> 23:36.754
Before the meteor shower.
After that, everything changed.

23:36.755 --> 23:39.174
My father used to say that...
that the meteor

23:39.200 --> 23:41.908
shower infected Smallville somehow.
It brought an..

23:41.909 --> 23:44.074
Evil to our town.

23:44.109 --> 23:46.570
Sounds like something
from the sci-fi channel.

23:46.571 --> 23:47.846
Yeah.

23:47.847 --> 23:52.209
I'm sorry, I get a little carried away
by the past sometimes.

23:52.694 --> 23:56.939
I don't have many memories
of my father, you know.

23:56.940 --> 23:59.525
He passed away when I was young.

24:01.202 --> 24:03.355
I know what it's like to lose a parent.

24:03.356 --> 24:05.378
My mom died when I was little.

24:05.379 --> 24:08.230
I cherish the memories I have of her.

24:08.687 --> 24:09.914
Yeah...

24:10.241 --> 24:14.917
my favorites are when my father
used to talk about Smallville

24:14.918 --> 24:17.584
and the way things used to be.

24:17.964 --> 24:19.289
I mean...

24:19.302 --> 24:21.163
look at it now.

24:21.164 --> 24:25.301
Nobody... nobody cares
about right or wrong or...

24:25.302 --> 24:26.901
or morality.

24:26.902 --> 24:30.086
Like that football coach dating a student.

24:30.087 --> 24:31.783
It's not right.

24:31.825 --> 24:34.522
They're both over 18.

24:37.133 --> 24:41.252
Lois, it... it doesn't make it right.

24:41.318 --> 24:45.209
No. I mean, rules...
rules are there for a reason.

24:45.210 --> 24:49.301
If those two got away with it,
then other people would try,

24:49.302 --> 24:50.820
you see?

24:50.918 --> 24:53.987
It's a good thing
that they were punished.

24:54.687 --> 24:57.232
So you think they were
attacked because someone

24:57.258 --> 24:59.377
thought their
relationship was immoral?

25:00.546 --> 25:04.988
I think that they got exactly
what they deserved.

25:10.431 --> 25:12.230
Wow... just look at the time.

25:12.231 --> 25:16.657
I've gotta get back to the Torch.
I have some... studying to do.

25:35.460 --> 25:37.444
Chloe, have you seen Clark?

25:37.445 --> 25:40.077
What?
Have I seen Clark do what?

25:40.091 --> 25:42.028
What? Uh...

25:42.029 --> 25:44.212
- yeah, I've seen him.
- Where?

25:44.213 --> 25:46.166
Why?
Something happen?

25:46.167 --> 25:48.096
Bad date. I'm starting
to think maybe

25:48.122 --> 25:50.177
Alicia isn't our
resident psycho killer.

25:50.178 --> 25:51.670
I need to find Clark.

25:51.671 --> 25:54.352
He's probably zipping around,
looking for Alicia.

25:54.963 --> 25:56.400
You all right?

25:56.471 --> 25:59.621
Fine. Yeah.
Fine. Uh...

26:01.871 --> 26:03.670
he's probably out at Alicia's house.

26:03.671 --> 26:05.332
I'll swing by, see if he's there.
Can you

26:05.358 --> 26:06.993
give me a call if he shows up here?
Okay.

26:06.994 --> 26:09.030
Okay.
Okay.

26:21.736 --> 26:23.535
I'm glad you're finally home.

26:23.536 --> 26:25.168
What are you doing?

26:26.028 --> 26:27.531
Oh, I'm...

26:27.659 --> 26:31.658
I'm just looking for evidence
to leave at the next murder.

26:31.659 --> 26:33.549
It was you.

26:33.905 --> 26:37.089
Everyone thinks that
I'm guilty because of you.

26:37.090 --> 26:38.665
You are guilty.
I mean, this...

26:38.691 --> 26:41.027
this really used to be
such a nice little town.

26:41.028 --> 26:43.320
You don't understand what you've done.

26:43.321 --> 26:46.891
Even Clark thinks that I'm guilty.
You're not getting to...

26:49.613 --> 26:51.067
I already have.

27:16.465 --> 27:19.438
You certainly have grown.

27:20.434 --> 27:25.202
Forgive me, but... you'll have to
refresh my memory, Mrs. Teague.

27:25.203 --> 27:27.448
I wasn't aware that we'd met before.

27:27.449 --> 27:30.163
No, please, Lex, call me Genevieve.

27:30.603 --> 27:35.017
I served on numerous committees
with your father and your late mother.

27:35.018 --> 27:37.169
I used to see you with them often.

27:37.679 --> 27:40.217
A bored young boy at the opera...

27:40.218 --> 27:42.366
always getting into trouble.

27:42.587 --> 27:45.601
Some of my finer moments, I'm sure.

27:45.602 --> 27:47.832
Can I get you something, Genevieve?

27:47.833 --> 27:51.355
I assure you, my tastes have matured.

27:53.048 --> 27:57.706
I'm sure you've developed a taste
for quite a lot of things, Lex.

28:01.699 --> 28:05.350
I understand you have
a relationship with Lana Lang.

28:06.761 --> 28:09.442
Care to tell me where this is going?

28:11.284 --> 28:14.898
My son is young, Lex.
Young and headstrong...

28:14.924 --> 28:17.123
like that boy at the opera.

28:17.283 --> 28:20.077
He can't always see what's best for him.

28:20.083 --> 28:21.940
And you can.

28:22.037 --> 28:25.258
With the wisdom of age, yes, I can.

28:25.259 --> 28:27.935
And what I see is that he's

28:27.936 --> 28:31.344
throwing his future away,
as is your friend.

28:34.593 --> 28:39.067
Surely you know they're in a relationship
that will never work.

28:39.762 --> 28:42.223
I don't usually involve
myself in other

28:42.249 --> 28:44.807
people's affairs of
the heart, Genevieve.

28:44.808 --> 28:47.176
But you did intervene at the high school.

28:47.177 --> 28:49.568
That was a civic matter.

28:50.192 --> 28:52.793
Look, I'm not a family
therapist, but I

28:52.819 --> 28:55.484
would suggest that you
talk to your son.

28:57.839 --> 29:00.311
Oh, I've tried, Lex.

29:00.885 --> 29:03.823
But as is often the way with young men,

29:03.824 --> 29:06.780
they don't listen particularly to their mothers.

29:08.631 --> 29:11.881
I was hoping I could
persuade you to help me.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.802
As I said, I don't interfere...

29:16.803 --> 29:20.390
in other people's affairs
of the heart, I know.

29:21.588 --> 29:23.972
Perhaps you should look
at the bigger picture, Lex.

29:23.973 --> 29:27.527
Helping me could work
to your advantage.

29:28.065 --> 29:30.480
I recently came across
some information

29:30.481 --> 29:33.071
about how your father
managed to overturn

29:33.097 --> 29:35.439
his conviction and
get out of prison.

29:36.241 --> 29:38.728
Information you might find...

29:38.810 --> 29:40.991
very interesting.

30:12.698 --> 30:14.233
Alicia!

30:26.087 --> 30:27.106
Alicia.

30:34.410 --> 30:36.477
No. Please, no.

30:38.533 --> 30:40.517
Please, Alicia.

30:40.518 --> 30:42.456
No... no.

30:44.441 --> 30:45.878
No!

30:46.379 --> 30:47.349
No!

30:52.303 --> 30:53.789
No!

30:56.011 --> 30:57.125
Clark!

30:58.272 --> 31:00.081
Oh, my god.

31:00.395 --> 31:02.753
Clark, what happened?

31:07.784 --> 31:10.385
I think I know who did this...

31:12.422 --> 31:14.894
and where we can find him.

31:29.504 --> 31:32.799
Even you thought she was guilty,
didn't you? Huh?

31:38.135 --> 31:43.917
Try not to feel too bad. I mean, hey,
she did try to kill your girlfriend last year.

31:46.104 --> 31:48.580
You tried to kill Lana.
What does that make you?

31:48.581 --> 31:53.467
No, try to understand, Clark.
I did what's right for Smallville.

31:53.550 --> 31:56.167
I have to make things right.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.284
You killed Alicia.

31:58.990 --> 32:02.075
I loved her, and you took
that away from me.

32:22.755 --> 32:24.597
You killed her!

32:24.955 --> 32:27.431
All she wanted was a chance.

32:27.432 --> 32:29.493
- You killed her!
- Clark! Stop!

32:29.494 --> 32:32.336
Stop! Clark!

32:37.279 --> 32:38.716
Let him go!

32:47.759 --> 32:49.746
It's gonna be okay.

32:51.990 --> 32:54.526
Clark, it's gonna be okay.

33:04.885 --> 33:07.441
Now, why would Lex Luthor
want to see me?

33:07.442 --> 33:09.122
Let me take a stab at it.

33:09.242 --> 33:12.644
'Cause you want to lecture me
on the evils of a part-time

33:12.670 --> 33:15.518
coach dating an 18-year-old
high school student.

33:15.519 --> 33:18.827
I took a hard line about
the school rules, Jason, but...

33:18.828 --> 33:22.196
that doesn't mean I don't appreciate
the individuals involved.

33:22.197 --> 33:24.704
I'm sorry I cost you a job.

33:24.705 --> 33:26.821
And I'd like to make it up to you.

33:28.962 --> 33:30.302
Really.

33:30.962 --> 33:33.090
I mean, you still
haven't rescheduled my

33:33.116 --> 33:35.530
meeting with your H.R.
guy over at Luthorcorp.

33:35.531 --> 33:38.924
I have a position you might
find more appealing.

33:39.454 --> 33:43.157
A position that pays $100,000 a year.

33:44.366 --> 33:48.642
Because I'm obviously qualified
for a $100,000-a-year job.

33:48.643 --> 33:50.584
My mother put you up to this,
didn't she?

33:50.585 --> 33:52.845
She is trying her best
to get between Lana and me.

33:52.846 --> 33:55.705
She's trying to do
a lot more than that, Jason.

33:56.092 --> 33:58.661
That's why I want to work together...

33:58.723 --> 34:01.324
to find out what she's really up to.

34:01.681 --> 34:03.773
You want to team up
against my mother?

34:03.774 --> 34:05.938
The enemy of my enemy.

34:07.574 --> 34:10.158
And how do I know I can trust you?

34:10.789 --> 34:12.259
You don't.

34:13.036 --> 34:15.685
But what other choice do you have?

34:37.283 --> 34:38.591
Clark...

34:40.452 --> 34:43.710
honey, you've been up here for two days.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.646
What happened to Alicia...

34:54.893 --> 34:57.056
wasn't your fault.

34:59.093 --> 35:01.856
If I had believed her,
she wouldn't be dead.

35:01.978 --> 35:02.930
Clark,

35:02.932 --> 35:05.549
she was framed. There's...

35:06.547 --> 35:09.341
there's no way
you could've known that.

35:11.024 --> 35:12.931
I could've trusted her.

35:12.932 --> 35:15.254
Did you know that Alicia
wanted me to go to

35:15.280 --> 35:17.706
the sheriff with her and
tell her everything?

35:18.916 --> 35:22.669
Alicia thought that if people knew
the truth about me and what I can do,

35:22.670 --> 35:25.400
they wouldn't be so quick to judge her.

35:26.932 --> 35:29.011
But I didn't go.

35:30.158 --> 35:33.664
I was too afraid of
what people might think,

35:33.697 --> 35:35.449
how they would react.

35:35.450 --> 35:37.342
What if she was right?

35:37.343 --> 35:39.491
Because if people knew

35:40.130 --> 35:43.683
what I can do and who I really am...

35:45.591 --> 35:48.144
maybe she'd still be alive.

35:52.860 --> 35:56.189
And I just can't
forgive myself for that.

36:19.970 --> 36:23.015
I'm headed back to school.
I have an 8:00 class tomorrow.

36:23.016 --> 36:24.147
Okay.

36:25.339 --> 36:27.769
Looking for clues about Tim's ability,

36:27.770 --> 36:29.738
things we should have
seen before, blaming Alicia?

36:29.739 --> 36:31.723
I think maybe
I've seen too much already.

36:31.724 --> 36:35.431
I've spent the last four years
ferreting out meteor freaks, trying to

36:35.432 --> 36:37.370
expose them.

36:37.693 --> 36:40.116
I never should've started this wall.

36:41.739 --> 36:44.459
Chloe, you're a reporter.

36:44.606 --> 36:47.236
You investigate and expose.
That's who you are.

36:47.237 --> 36:50.080
Yeah, well, I guess
sometimes it sucks being me.

36:55.189 --> 36:56.403
Lois, if...

36:56.404 --> 36:58.731
if you found out something...

36:59.143 --> 37:01.262
something someone
didn't want you to

37:01.288 --> 37:03.578
know about them...
would you tell them?

37:04.347 --> 37:08.321
That depends. Is that person
someone you care about?

37:09.839 --> 37:11.132
Yeah.

37:11.224 --> 37:14.225
And has keeping
the secret hurt anyone?

37:16.251 --> 37:17.705
No.

37:18.359 --> 37:20.173
Then my answer is no.

37:20.174 --> 37:24.142
If I really cared about that person,
I wouldn't tell them that I knew.

37:24.143 --> 37:28.111
But I would go out of my way to be
supportive of them so that hopefully,

37:28.112 --> 37:31.916
one day, they would be comfortable
enough to tell me themselves.

37:33.098 --> 37:37.072
No offense, Lois, but that's the last thing
I expected to hear from you.

37:38.600 --> 37:41.922
I've learned the hard way
that people keep secrets for a reason,

37:41.923 --> 37:44.540
even from the people
they're closest to.

37:47.143 --> 37:50.164
Chloe, is there something
you want to tell me?

37:52.543 --> 37:54.696
Are you the one with the secret?

37:54.697 --> 37:56.215
No.

37:56.782 --> 37:58.575
No, it's not me.

37:58.951 --> 38:00.340
Okay.

38:01.659 --> 38:04.291
I'll see you in a couple
of weeks or so.

38:04.413 --> 38:05.527
Yeah.

38:08.932 --> 38:11.992
I'm sure whoever it is
that you're talking about

38:11.993 --> 38:14.336
will tell you when they're ready.

38:15.470 --> 38:16.973
Thanks.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.461
Bye baby.

38:18.611 --> 38:19.742
Bye.

38:20.103 --> 38:22.268
- Safe drive home.
- Okay.

38:37.174 --> 38:38.708
Clark...

38:39.543 --> 38:40.979
why don't you just tell me?

38:57.703 --> 39:00.592
Local teen discovers Indian caves.

39:28.786 --> 39:29.949
Hey, Clark.

39:31.863 --> 39:35.240
I... just wanted to say
that I am so sorry.

39:35.602 --> 39:37.735
For everything.

39:43.590 --> 39:46.497
It must've been so hard

39:46.882 --> 39:49.047
being so different,

39:50.093 --> 39:54.225
having everyone judge you
before they even know you.

39:55.591 --> 39:59.452
Knowing that there's some people that...
might never accept you.

40:06.886 --> 40:08.146
I just...

40:08.978 --> 40:12.257
I want you to know
that I'm here for you...

40:13.424 --> 40:15.734
if you ever need to talk.

40:20.867 --> 40:24.340
Thanks, Chloe.
I appreciate that.
