WEBVTT

00:04.911 --> 00:06.446
Elizabeth, are you in or out?

00:06.447 --> 00:07.781
Are you insane, Will?

00:07.782 --> 00:09.315
Knock.

00:10.350 --> 00:11.518
Are you in or out?

00:11.519 --> 00:13.653
- Of what?
- Milkshakes at M&G's.

00:13.654 --> 00:14.855
I have to study.

00:14.856 --> 00:16.823
Come on, Euclid, it's 15 minutes.

00:16.824 --> 00:18.065
Come on, you could use a break.

00:18.066 --> 00:19.809
Yeah, your head is
actually starting to take

00:19.810 --> 00:21.394
- the shape of an egg.
- Will.

00:21.395 --> 00:22.796
At least there's a brain inside.

00:22.797 --> 00:25.432
Family time. Let's go, Elizabeth.

00:25.433 --> 00:26.366
Last chance!

00:26.367 --> 00:28.602
Bring me something back. Strawberry.

00:28.603 --> 00:30.003
Gross. Who has strawberry? Like...

00:30.004 --> 00:31.338
All right, get out of here.

00:31.339 --> 00:33.206
Okay.

00:33.207 --> 00:34.741
Close the door!

00:34.742 --> 00:36.076
Sorry.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.077
Two scoops.

00:39.646 --> 00:42.616
You could take a page
out of her book, you know.

00:42.617 --> 00:44.417
What book, the weirdo book?

00:44.418 --> 00:46.586
Everybody at school thinks she's a nerd.

00:46.587 --> 00:48.855
She's not a nerd. She's gifted.

00:48.856 --> 00:50.557
Yeah, at being a nerd.

00:50.558 --> 00:51.691
You have every bit

00:51.692 --> 00:53.960
as much potential; It's just a matter

00:53.961 --> 00:55.929
of applying yourself.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.697
Wait, wait, turn this up.

00:57.698 --> 00:59.165
The Fix.

00:59.166 --> 01:00.800
So cool.

01:00.801 --> 01:03.470
Sounds like new wave to me.

01:03.471 --> 01:06.939
Wait, you know what new wave is?

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.106 --> 01:41.574
Dad.

01:41.575 --> 01:44.844
Come on. Come on.

01:52.185 --> 01:55.455
Mom, what can I do?

01:55.456 --> 01:57.523
What should I do?

02:06.866 --> 02:08.268
Help!

02:08.269 --> 02:11.404
Please, somebody help!

02:11.405 --> 02:13.505
Help! Over here!

02:14.908 --> 02:16.543
Please!

02:16.544 --> 02:18.445
Somebody help!

02:18.446 --> 02:20.080
Help!

02:20.081 --> 02:22.882
You really think your brother's
gonna care about a photo?

02:24.185 --> 02:26.419
Yes, because the last time he was here,

02:26.420 --> 02:27.687
he made some crack about

02:27.688 --> 02:28.955
not seeing one.

02:28.956 --> 02:31.224
Well, don't we have
any more recent ones,

02:31.225 --> 02:33.326
- like maybe him and his family?
- No.

02:33.327 --> 02:36.296
Because in order to take one of those,

02:36.297 --> 02:39.065
he'd have to be in the
same location as his family

02:39.066 --> 02:41.001
for more than five minutes.

02:41.002 --> 02:44.004
Okay, you might want to get
all that out of your system

02:44.005 --> 02:45.171
before they get here.

02:45.172 --> 02:46.740
That's what I'm doing.

02:46.741 --> 02:49.442
You having second thoughts
about getting him that interview?

02:49.443 --> 02:52.612
No. It's the perfect job for him.

02:52.613 --> 02:56.149
I mean, if he's really
serious about settling down

02:56.150 --> 02:58.184
and acting like a normal doctor

02:58.185 --> 03:00.220
with a normal job.

03:00.221 --> 03:03.390
I just... I don't want him to resent me.

03:03.391 --> 03:05.325
Well, Sophie made it
very clear that he needed

03:05.326 --> 03:07.694
to get a job where he could
spend more time with them.

03:07.695 --> 03:09.529
So, if he wants to keep
his family together,

03:09.530 --> 03:10.633
he's doing the right thing.

03:10.634 --> 03:13.433
I mean, I get how rewarding it is

03:13.434 --> 03:16.903
to be a war-zone doctor.

03:16.904 --> 03:19.305
Go to those places no one else will.

03:19.306 --> 03:21.741
Sweep in, save lives,

03:21.742 --> 03:23.076
sweep out.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.111
Yeah, but Annie's only
six. She deserves a father.

03:25.112 --> 03:28.214
We figured out how to
balance our lives, right?

03:28.215 --> 03:29.582
So can he.

03:29.583 --> 03:32.819
The fact that he wants to
turn things around says a lot.

03:32.820 --> 03:34.987
Yeah, it does.

03:36.723 --> 03:39.291
We have that figured out, right?

03:40.660 --> 03:41.895
Absolutely.

03:48.802 --> 03:51.304
Aah! Yay, they're here! Finally!

03:52.807 --> 03:53.940
What's with all the adults?

03:53.941 --> 03:54.974
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:54.975 --> 03:56.709
Hi.

03:56.710 --> 03:58.578
- Are we in the right house?
- Yes.

03:58.579 --> 04:00.680
Wait a minute, who is this young woman?

04:00.681 --> 04:02.682
Annie.

04:02.683 --> 04:03.843
Uncle Henry's kidding, honey.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.565
You remember Uncle
Henry and Aunt Elizabeth?

04:05.566 --> 04:07.049
- No.
- Well, of course not.

04:07.050 --> 04:10.323
Because the last time you
were here, it was so long ago,

04:10.324 --> 04:12.459
- you were just three.
- I've seen pictures.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.528
Well, we got plenty of time
to get to know each other.

04:15.529 --> 04:16.696
Because why?

04:16.697 --> 04:18.565
Because we're moving to this house.

04:18.565 --> 04:20.733
No, honey.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.035
To this town.

04:22.036 --> 04:23.902
Well, we'll... we'll see how it goes.

04:25.105 --> 04:26.639
Okay, who's hungry? Come on.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.341
Come on, we got all
kinds of yummy muffins

04:28.342 --> 04:29.943
and carbs and fruit.

04:29.944 --> 04:31.978
Kitchen is open for special orders.

04:31.979 --> 04:32.979
Waffles and bacon.

04:32.980 --> 04:34.681
No. Guests first.

04:34.682 --> 04:36.216
And would you please put that away.

04:36.217 --> 04:38.184
Just turning it off.

04:38.185 --> 04:40.353
- I can also make smoothies.
- Everything looks great.

04:40.354 --> 04:41.988
Can I see this girl's room?

04:41.989 --> 04:44.757
Alison? She must like
what you're wearing.

04:44.758 --> 04:45.792
She's into clothes.

04:45.793 --> 04:48.761
So am I. In fact, I have a few looks

04:48.762 --> 04:51.030
featured in a fashion
and design show at school.

04:51.031 --> 04:53.565
Which you are all officially invited to.

04:54.367 --> 04:56.136
You don't have to come,

04:56.137 --> 04:57.137
but please come.

04:57.138 --> 04:58.104
We'd love to.

04:58.105 --> 04:59.372
Should we check out my closet?

04:59.373 --> 05:00.573
Sure.

05:00.574 --> 05:03.743
I'm so glad you guys
could come in on a Sunday.

05:03.744 --> 05:05.645
Then we have time to hang out.

05:05.646 --> 05:08.815
So what is this new job Mom
told us about at Walter Reed?

05:08.816 --> 05:11.217
Well, I don't have it
yet. I'm interviewing.

05:11.218 --> 05:14.187
But it's training trauma surgeons

05:14.188 --> 05:16.322
to perform in high-stress situations.

05:16.323 --> 05:20.226
So teach people to do what
I... what I used to do.

05:20.227 --> 05:22.695
It's gonna be so cool
to have you guys in town.

05:22.696 --> 05:23.796
Yeah.

05:23.797 --> 05:26.266
Wow. 9.1. That's a...

05:26.267 --> 05:28.034
That's a big earthquake, right?

05:28.035 --> 05:29.335
Where?

05:29.336 --> 05:30.987
- Venezuela.
- Yeah, that's huge.

05:30.988 --> 05:32.207
Everything's been knocked out.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.406
There's no communication.

05:33.407 --> 05:35.711
There hasn't been much upkeep
on the infrastructure there,

05:35.712 --> 05:39.078
but a quake that size
could be devastating.

05:39.079 --> 05:41.383
Do we have an embassy in Caracas?

05:41.384 --> 05:42.784
Yeah, we do.

05:44.817 --> 05:46.786
Excuse me. I'm sorry...

05:46.787 --> 05:47.887
Don't be. Go.

05:47.888 --> 05:50.690
Nadine, how bad is it?

05:50.691 --> 05:53.793
Still no communication with the embassy?

05:53.794 --> 05:56.930
No, ma'am. No contact with the
Venezuelan government, either.

05:56.931 --> 05:58.898
Yeah, at this point, even the sat phones

05:58.899 --> 06:00.266
are spotty and unreliable.

06:00.267 --> 06:03.169
All we know so far is
that President Suarez

06:03.170 --> 06:04.837
was addressing the National Assembly

06:04.838 --> 06:06.072
when the earthquake hit.

06:06.073 --> 06:08.875
We have no idea why he
called a session on a Sunday.

06:08.876 --> 06:10.443
Other than he thinks he's God?

06:10.444 --> 06:14.013
- Miss Tolliver?
- He was probably mid anti-American rant.

06:14.014 --> 06:15.715
And that guy never misses an opportunity

06:15.716 --> 06:19.752
to rail against the brutish
and imperialistic United States.

06:19.753 --> 06:22.455
- He could be dead.
- Rest in peace.

06:22.456 --> 06:26.292
Okay, here are the satellite
photos from Caracas.

06:26.293 --> 06:29.362
The Plaza Bolivar is gone.

06:29.363 --> 06:33.233
That's the roof of the
Capitolio on the ground.

06:33.234 --> 06:36.069
The embassy is at least
still recognizable.

06:36.070 --> 06:37.653
Would anyone even be there on a Sunday?

06:37.654 --> 06:39.539
Keep trying our embassy
employees' sat phones.

06:39.540 --> 06:40.607
Yep.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.508
We need to get in touch
with the Ops Center

06:42.509 --> 06:44.611
and get the latest stats
on Americans in country.

06:44.612 --> 06:48.214
Daisy, Nadine, make
sure that the 800 number

06:48.215 --> 06:50.483
and the Web site for
information on Venezuela

06:50.484 --> 06:52.418
- are up and running.
- Yeah.

06:52.419 --> 06:53.820
Coordinate with USAID.

06:53.821 --> 06:55.564
I want to stay on top
of our progress there.

06:55.565 --> 06:56.923
What about me, ma'am?

06:56.924 --> 07:01.728
Help with the messaging
for worried families.

07:01.729 --> 07:04.597
It's gonna be a hard few days.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.232
If you could check on the 800 number,

07:06.233 --> 07:08.301
I'll head over to the Ops Center.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.370
Will do.

07:10.371 --> 07:12.805
Excuse me, Ms. Tolliver,
your line kept ringing.

07:12.806 --> 07:14.974
I picked it up... I didn't
know what the system was.

07:14.975 --> 07:17.377
Well, there's not really
much of a system today.

07:17.378 --> 07:19.212
- Who is it?
- Arabelle Marsh.

07:19.213 --> 07:21.116
She's the wife of the
former Secretary of State.

07:21.117 --> 07:22.782
She says you know her.

07:22.783 --> 07:25.184
Of course. I'll take
the call in my office.

07:25.185 --> 07:26.953
Well, she's here. She was calling

07:26.954 --> 07:28.321
from downstairs from the lobby.

07:28.322 --> 07:30.957
All right...

07:30.958 --> 07:32.792
Well, you can bring her up.

07:32.793 --> 07:35.060
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

07:38.464 --> 07:40.300
I'm sure it's about Venezuela.

07:40.301 --> 07:43.001
- They had a place down there.
- Of course.

07:44.337 --> 07:46.339
Does she know?

07:46.340 --> 07:48.473
About you and Secretary Marsh?

07:50.943 --> 07:52.979
I have no idea.

07:52.980 --> 07:55.782
Can you check in with the
Ops Center, too, please?

07:55.783 --> 07:57.749
- Of course.
- Thanks.

08:04.457 --> 08:06.525
Thank you.

08:08.061 --> 08:10.897
Arabelle... it's been a long time.

08:10.898 --> 08:12.799
- How are you?
- I'm well, Nadine.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.133
Thank you for seeing me.

08:14.134 --> 08:16.302
Thank you.

08:16.303 --> 08:18.438
I can imagine what kind
of day you're having.

08:18.439 --> 08:19.806
Yes, it's a lot.

08:19.807 --> 08:22.008
There's still not a great
deal of communication,

08:22.009 --> 08:25.278
and we're scrambling for information.

08:25.279 --> 08:28.214
Well, unfortunately,
that's what I'm looking for.

08:28.215 --> 08:31.084
You remember Vincent and I
had a ranch outside of Caracas?

08:31.085 --> 08:32.251
Yes, I do.

08:32.251 --> 08:34.520
Well, I kept it going
after he passed away,

08:34.520 --> 08:37.123
with the same property
manager we had for years.

08:37.124 --> 08:40.126
She lives in an area that's
close to where the quake struck,

08:40.126 --> 08:42.929
and I have not been able to reach her.

08:42.929 --> 08:44.230
I know it's a lot to ask,

08:44.231 --> 08:45.854
but I wondered if
maybe you could help me

08:45.855 --> 08:46.966
find out about her?

08:46.967 --> 08:49.102
Of course. What's her name?

08:49.103 --> 08:51.571
Carla Alvarez.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.073
You might have even spoken
with her on occasion.

08:54.074 --> 08:56.509
Yes, I believe so.

08:56.510 --> 08:57.977
I feel bad about asking,

08:57.978 --> 09:00.213
but she really is like family.

09:00.214 --> 09:04.917
Well, I'll do my best to get
whatever information I can.

09:04.918 --> 09:07.820
Thank you, Nadine.

09:07.821 --> 09:11.057
So terrible what's happening.

09:11.058 --> 09:14.193
I have fond memories of
being there with Vincent.

09:14.194 --> 09:17.430
Such a turbulent place,
but he found it beautiful.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.733
Something about it really spoke to him.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.634
I remember.

09:24.937 --> 09:29.142
So I will look into
this and get back to you

09:29.143 --> 09:30.376
as soon as I can.

09:30.377 --> 09:32.612
- Thank you. Bye.
- Yeah.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.479
Bye.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.056
Hey. So USAID and the navy are all set.

09:44.057 --> 09:46.492
The hospital ship is manned,
stocked, and ready to go.

09:46.493 --> 09:48.761
Well, we can't move
until we get permission

09:48.762 --> 09:50.463
from the Venezuelan government.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.165
Right, because President Suarez

09:52.166 --> 09:55.001
would consider American
aid to be an invading force.

09:55.002 --> 09:57.837
Well, no foreign aid
at all can get in there

09:57.838 --> 09:59.572
without consent from the top.

09:59.573 --> 10:01.307
Ma'am, I have Ambassador
Willis in Caracas.

10:01.308 --> 10:02.575
I got through on his sat phone.

10:02.576 --> 10:04.010
Thank God.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.346
Chuck, it's Secretary McCord.

10:07.347 --> 10:08.881
I'm here with Jay Whitman.

10:08.882 --> 10:11.083
Madam Secretary, Jay, finally.

10:12.286 --> 10:14.287
You cannot imagine how relieved we are

10:14.288 --> 10:16.489
to hear your voice. How are you?

10:16.490 --> 10:19.559
We are still standing.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.561
The embassy was built
to a higher building code

10:21.562 --> 10:23.729
than most of the structures in Caracas.

10:23.730 --> 10:25.832
So we took a hit,

10:25.833 --> 10:27.834
but nothing like everyone else.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.268
What about our people?

10:29.269 --> 10:31.637
We have a number of
injuries, some missing.

10:31.638 --> 10:34.307
Three confirmed dead.

10:34.308 --> 10:36.612
We're still trying to get an
accurate account of everyone.

10:36.613 --> 10:39.245
Look, I know we need
to get aid in there,

10:39.246 --> 10:41.481
but we can't risk sending anyone in

10:41.482 --> 10:43.816
without permission
from President Suarez.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.218
President Suarez is dead.

10:45.219 --> 10:48.421
My friend, Salvador
Vela, is the Secretary

10:48.422 --> 10:49.789
of the National Assembly,

10:49.790 --> 10:53.226
and according to him, the...
the whole Capitolio collapsed

10:53.227 --> 10:55.261
as the president was speaking.

10:55.262 --> 10:57.629
The Executive Vice President died, too.

10:59.699 --> 11:03.202
We need to speak to the next
in the line of succession.

11:03.203 --> 11:04.203
Who's that?

11:04.204 --> 11:08.241
President of
the National Assembly.

11:08.242 --> 11:10.375
He's dead, too.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.639
Venezuela's constitution only stipulates

11:13.640 --> 11:15.107
a three-person line of succession.

11:15.108 --> 11:18.350
There's no one else named after that.

11:21.654 --> 11:23.356
Chuck, we'll figure this out.

11:23.357 --> 11:26.425
Okay, in the meantime,
you need to stay safe

11:26.426 --> 11:28.394
while we coordinate a response plan

11:28.395 --> 11:31.831
to get all non-essential
embassy people evacuated, okay?

11:31.832 --> 11:32.899
Yes, ma'am.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.535
I know I don't need to say this, but...

11:35.536 --> 11:37.303
please hurry.

11:37.304 --> 11:39.404
Talk soon.

11:51.050 --> 11:52.818
Okay, let's move!

11:52.819 --> 11:54.620
Keep an eye on those test tube kits.

11:54.621 --> 11:56.054
They don't come cheap.

12:12.038 --> 12:15.040
Vamos, chicos!

12:34.093 --> 12:35.827
No. Somos doctores.

12:44.304 --> 12:47.672
Somos doctores. Somos doctores!

12:48.207 --> 12:49.674
Somos doctores!

12:51.744 --> 12:53.745
Somos doctores! Somos doctores!

13:08.454 --> 13:11.186
The abducted aid workers
are part of an NGO

13:11.187 --> 13:12.712
operating out of Florida.

13:12.713 --> 13:13.780
They're called.

13:13.781 --> 13:15.715
The International Collective of Doctors.

13:15.716 --> 13:18.351
They pride themselves on
being the first to arrive

13:18.352 --> 13:19.535
wherever they're most needed.

13:19.536 --> 13:21.654
Yeah, well, they might
want to rethink that.

13:21.655 --> 13:23.990
Do we have any idea who
grabbed them and why?

13:23.991 --> 13:28.227
DEA Intel says that they
were taken by Los HuÃ©rfanos,

13:28.228 --> 13:31.297
a mega-gang that rules
the slums of Caracas.

13:31.298 --> 13:32.265
They've also become

13:32.266 --> 13:33.733
the unofficial police force

13:33.734 --> 13:36.235
for Francisco Suarez Jr.

13:36.236 --> 13:37.704
The late president's son?

13:37.705 --> 13:41.374
He has a reputation for
being a globetrotting partier.

13:41.375 --> 13:42.675
He's a gang leader now?

13:42.676 --> 13:43.676
No.

13:43.677 --> 13:45.511
He's in government now.

13:45.512 --> 13:47.379
He says he's the new president.

13:48.181 --> 13:50.283
He's never held public office.

13:50.284 --> 13:51.818
Even the Venezuelans make fun of him.

13:51.819 --> 13:54.620
So he has no real
claim to the presidency.

13:54.621 --> 13:58.858
What he does have is
six American aid workers.

13:58.859 --> 14:02.128
Suarez Jr.'s actions
have managed to halt

14:02.129 --> 14:04.430
all other international groups

14:04.431 --> 14:07.066
from sending in aid
because of safety concerns.

14:07.067 --> 14:10.403
I'd hate to pile on, but...

14:10.404 --> 14:12.805
I spoke with Colombia's
foreign minister.

14:12.806 --> 14:15.475
They're expecting a sizeable escalation

14:15.476 --> 14:18.511
in what's already a big
refugee problem with Venezuela.

14:18.512 --> 14:21.214
Well, we have hit the trifecta...

14:21.215 --> 14:24.083
a hostage crisis, a humanitarian crisis,

14:24.084 --> 14:25.818
and a political crisis.

14:25.819 --> 14:27.220
All in one.

14:27.221 --> 14:29.856
Let's start by tracking down Suarez Jr.

14:29.857 --> 14:31.758
Get him on the phone,
see what his demands are.

14:31.759 --> 14:33.259
Sir,

14:33.260 --> 14:35.895
we can't acknowledge
the status he's assumed.

14:35.896 --> 14:37.296
Of course not.

14:37.297 --> 14:39.298
We're calling to offer our condolences

14:39.299 --> 14:42.235
for the loss of his father.

14:42.236 --> 14:44.669
Then see what happens.

14:47.073 --> 14:49.409
Anybody home?

14:49.410 --> 14:51.077
Just me. I'm in the kitchen.

14:51.078 --> 14:52.612
Just you?

14:52.613 --> 14:55.415
Yup.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.150
What have you done with my family?

14:57.151 --> 14:59.185
Apparently, there was
some kind of sewing crisis

14:59.186 --> 15:01.020
in the collection

15:01.021 --> 15:02.084
for Alison's fashion show,

15:02.085 --> 15:03.656
so Sophie and Annie volunteered

15:03.657 --> 15:05.858
to be her wingmen at the fabric store.

15:05.859 --> 15:08.528
Hey, that... that sounds...

15:08.529 --> 15:09.695
Terrifying?

15:09.696 --> 15:11.431
So terrifying.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.695
Well, I guess you'll be the
first to know, I got the job.

15:13.696 --> 15:15.501
Hey, man.

15:15.502 --> 15:17.403
Fantastic, congratulations.

15:17.404 --> 15:19.747
- Good for you.
- I'll be head of the training program.

15:19.748 --> 15:21.774
Grooming my successors.

15:21.775 --> 15:24.177
And I am stoked.

15:24.178 --> 15:25.178
Dude.

15:25.179 --> 15:28.147
Lying is not your gift.

15:28.148 --> 15:30.349
Well, not stoked yet,

15:30.350 --> 15:32.085
but, I'll get there.

15:32.086 --> 15:35.021
Well, come on, it's important work.

15:35.022 --> 15:37.390
And you get to stay in the same
place for a while, you know?

15:37.391 --> 15:38.691
Keep your family.

15:38.692 --> 15:43.196
You know, if we don't get
aid down in Venezuela soon,

15:43.197 --> 15:46.065
it's gonna make Haiti look
like a day at the fair.

15:46.066 --> 15:47.500
I know.

15:47.501 --> 15:48.734
I just got off the
phone with your sister.

15:48.735 --> 15:50.703
She had the overwhelmed
voice. You know, that...

15:50.704 --> 15:51.838
Yeah.

15:51.839 --> 15:52.872
Half sentences.

15:52.873 --> 15:55.174
Unfinished thoughts.

15:55.175 --> 15:56.809
Dangling modifiers.

15:56.810 --> 16:01.314
Wow, sloppy grammar Elizabeth?

16:01.315 --> 16:03.349
She's in the thick of it.

16:03.350 --> 16:04.417
Yeah, she is.

16:04.418 --> 16:07.053
But having you guys around really helps.

16:07.054 --> 16:09.988
Yeah, we really like spending
time with you guys, too.

16:12.658 --> 16:15.261
You know, every time

16:15.262 --> 16:16.929
I flew into one of these disasters,

16:16.930 --> 16:18.331
it started the same way.

16:18.332 --> 16:21.366
We'd tell each other our war stories.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.036
It sounded like a competition,

16:24.037 --> 16:26.772
but I'm sure we were just preparing for

16:26.773 --> 16:29.108
what we were about to walk into.

16:29.109 --> 16:32.044
I don't know if you had a
similar process in the Marines.

16:32.045 --> 16:35.781
You mean posturing and
bravado, and trash talking

16:35.782 --> 16:37.183
to disguise how terrified

16:37.184 --> 16:38.484
we all were?

16:38.485 --> 16:41.820
Nah, we didn't have anything
like that in the Marines.

16:42.522 --> 16:44.790
Do you ever miss it?

16:44.791 --> 16:48.194
Being a part of something bigger?

16:48.195 --> 16:50.429
Something essential?

16:50.430 --> 16:52.931
Well, I'd like to think that I still am.

16:53.766 --> 16:56.434
But it doesn't have
to be round the clock.

16:57.336 --> 17:00.206
And it shouldn't have
to cost you everything.

17:00.207 --> 17:02.008
Just because something
isn't life-threatening,

17:02.009 --> 17:03.309
doesn't mean it's not essential.

17:03.310 --> 17:05.111
So you really managed to get there?

17:05.112 --> 17:06.345
Yeah.

17:06.346 --> 17:07.779
How?

17:09.048 --> 17:10.916
Well, I thought about
all the guys I knew

17:10.917 --> 17:12.952
who made the ultimate sacrifice.

17:12.953 --> 17:16.255
Those brave men and women who
left their families behind.

17:16.256 --> 17:18.391
Some didn't even have a
chance to have a family.

17:18.392 --> 17:21.227
And they were willing to risk that...

17:21.228 --> 17:22.862
I guess for the same reason I was,

17:22.863 --> 17:24.063
a sense of duty.

17:24.064 --> 17:26.566
But there comes a point
where you've done your part,

17:26.567 --> 17:28.099
and if you go beyond that,

17:28.101 --> 17:30.770
then you might have other motives.

17:30.771 --> 17:33.105
Honestly,

17:33.106 --> 17:36.609
the idea of losing my
family scared me in a way

17:36.610 --> 17:38.411
that going into battle never did.

17:38.412 --> 17:40.346
Yeah.

17:40.347 --> 17:42.447
I get that.

17:44.110 --> 17:45.413
We would like to express

17:45.414 --> 17:47.687
our condolences on the
loss of your father.

17:47.688 --> 17:49.822
He was a great man.

17:49.823 --> 17:52.158
Something your country
never acknowledged.

17:52.159 --> 17:54.860
We all come together in times of loss,

17:54.861 --> 17:56.128
Mr. Suarez.

17:56.129 --> 17:57.512
That's why we'd like to talk about

17:57.513 --> 17:59.185
the American aid workers who have been

17:59.186 --> 18:01.734
taken hostage by Los HuÃ©rfanos.

18:01.735 --> 18:02.902
This is news to me.

18:02.903 --> 18:07.240
But perhaps these aid workers should've

18:07.241 --> 18:08.741
come to me first, I would've tried to

18:08.742 --> 18:10.076
assuage my people's fear

18:10.077 --> 18:13.212
that America was staging
a covert invasion.

18:13.213 --> 18:17.650
A covert invasion armed
with medical supplies?

18:17.651 --> 18:21.654
Los HuÃ©rfanos is rumored
to be quite vicious.

18:21.655 --> 18:23.022
I can talk to them on your behalf,

18:23.023 --> 18:26.592
but I would need something in return.

18:26.593 --> 18:28.127
Recognize my presidency

18:28.128 --> 18:30.296
and acknowledge its legitimacy.

18:30.297 --> 18:32.832
Fine, Mr. President.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.334
Now, will you please
free our aid workers?

18:35.335 --> 18:37.803
I will need a public acknowledgement

18:37.804 --> 18:39.238
of my presidency.

18:39.239 --> 18:42.575
Show me and my people
the respect we deserve,

18:42.576 --> 18:45.211
and I will insure the
release of your hostages

18:45.212 --> 18:47.480
and allow international aid
missions into my country,

18:47.481 --> 18:50.483
but under my supervision.

18:50.484 --> 18:52.485
If you want the trust and loyalty

18:52.486 --> 18:55.388
of your people, freeing our aid workers

18:55.389 --> 18:58.257
so that international aid can flow in,

18:58.258 --> 19:00.826
will take you a lot further
than attempting to blackmail

19:00.827 --> 19:02.595
the United States.

19:02.596 --> 19:05.231
I suggest you move quickly

19:05.232 --> 19:08.166
so that your people will not be harmed.

19:10.836 --> 19:13.406
That little pissant.

19:13.407 --> 19:17.510
A pissant who seems to
have us over a barrel.

19:17.511 --> 19:19.078
He knows that a U.S.-recognized

19:19.079 --> 19:21.814
administration would
give him legitimacy.

19:21.815 --> 19:23.949
We cannot be seen as capitulating

19:23.950 --> 19:25.117
to a wannabe dictator.

19:25.118 --> 19:26.652
Of course not.

19:26.653 --> 19:30.089
But we still have a humanitarian crisis

19:30.090 --> 19:32.124
that's getting worse by the hour,

19:32.125 --> 19:34.260
and six American hostages' lives

19:34.261 --> 19:36.324
that hang in the balance.
We've got to do something.

19:36.325 --> 19:38.597
Decapitation strike by
way of natural disaster.

19:38.598 --> 19:40.261
There's nothing in
the rule book for that.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.535
On the up side,

19:42.536 --> 19:44.503
we don't have to worry
about breaking the rules.

19:44.504 --> 19:46.172
So...

19:46.173 --> 19:50.975
what if we help the Venezuelans
find a legitimate leader?

20:00.768 --> 20:03.149
I just talked to my buddy
Pete at the Venezuela desk.

20:03.150 --> 20:04.517
He says we could make the argument

20:04.518 --> 20:06.119
that the title of interim president

20:06.120 --> 20:08.354
should go to the
senior-most surviving member

20:08.355 --> 20:09.789
of the National Assembly.

20:09.790 --> 20:12.225
So roughly the same as
our Speaker of the House.

20:12.226 --> 20:13.560
Exactly.

20:13.561 --> 20:15.865
It's an interpretation we can
use to get someone in power.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.330
I think the U.N. would support it.

20:17.331 --> 20:18.531
Okay, that's good.

20:18.532 --> 20:20.700
So who is it and is
he or she still alive?

20:20.701 --> 20:23.036
Salvador Vela, the Secretary
of the National Assembly.

20:23.037 --> 20:25.772
Who told Ambassador Willis
that President Suarez was dead.

20:25.773 --> 20:26.940
So, we know he survived.

20:26.941 --> 20:28.964
If we go to Vela and get
him to accept the position

20:28.965 --> 20:30.543
of interim president,

20:30.544 --> 20:34.047
he would be eons more
legitimate than Suarez Jr.

20:34.048 --> 20:36.149
Well, and he would
certainly allow in aid, so...

20:36.150 --> 20:37.550
There's one small hiccup.

20:37.551 --> 20:39.085
Of course there is.

20:39.086 --> 20:40.253
We don't know where Vela is.

20:40.254 --> 20:42.922
We need a search and rescue mission.

20:42.923 --> 20:45.091
Don't we have assets in Colombia, right?

20:45.092 --> 20:46.593
DEA has armed units stationed

20:46.594 --> 20:48.695
within miles of the
border with Venezuela.

20:48.696 --> 20:50.964
Okay, doesn't solve our hostage crisis,

20:50.965 --> 20:52.198
but it's a start.

20:52.199 --> 20:54.600
- I'm going back to the White House.
- Yes, ma'am.

20:55.335 --> 20:56.769
Daisy, any word yet

20:56.770 --> 20:58.638
on that woman I asked you to find,

20:58.639 --> 21:00.473
- Carla Alvarez?
- Not yet.

21:01.066 --> 21:02.742
I've been trying to
coordinate with the Ops Center

21:02.743 --> 21:04.077
about the hotline we set up.

21:04.078 --> 21:06.646
Though the information is
still spotty and unreliable.

21:06.647 --> 21:07.780
I'll keep checking.

21:07.781 --> 21:09.916
Never mind, I'll do it myself.

21:09.917 --> 21:11.084
Seriously?

21:11.085 --> 21:13.520
Hospitals in Caracas,
the ones still standing,

21:13.521 --> 21:15.922
you think someone's
still taking patient info?

21:15.923 --> 21:17.857
I'm doing the best that I can.

21:17.858 --> 21:20.360
I know. I know, you're right. I'm sorry.

21:20.361 --> 21:24.063
We're all a little on edge.

21:24.064 --> 21:27.132
And I can see how this would be
a little more sensitive for you.

21:30.436 --> 21:32.472
I know Carla Alvarez.

21:32.473 --> 21:34.707
Did you know her well?

21:34.708 --> 21:40.213
I'd see her when Vincent
and I visited down there.

21:40.214 --> 21:43.816
Arabelle doesn't know I
ever went to the ranch.

21:43.817 --> 21:45.151
Unless she does.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.021
This situation

21:48.022 --> 21:52.091
is just a big morass.

21:52.092 --> 21:54.527
I feel like blurting out the truth.

21:54.528 --> 21:56.062
Which would be awful.

21:56.063 --> 21:58.965
But I don't know, maybe it would just...

21:58.966 --> 22:01.000
I don't know, set us both free

22:01.001 --> 22:03.236
somehow.

22:05.105 --> 22:08.241
I'm just not sure that
I can carry this forever.

22:08.242 --> 22:12.078
Not by myself.

22:12.079 --> 22:13.546
Foreign affairs, I'm great.

22:13.547 --> 22:14.781
Domestic affairs?

22:14.782 --> 22:15.982
Not so much.

22:17.518 --> 22:21.588
Because the telecommunications
are so disrupted,

22:21.589 --> 22:24.023
most of the nation doesn't even know

22:24.024 --> 22:25.692
that Suarez Jr. has declared

22:25.693 --> 22:28.094
himself president, but
we have to act fast.

22:28.095 --> 22:30.163
So, assuming we can even find Vela,

22:30.164 --> 22:31.497
if communications are so bad,

22:31.498 --> 22:33.081
how-how is he gonna let his people know

22:33.082 --> 22:33.967
that he's in charge?

22:33.968 --> 22:35.271
We'd have to get him to Caracas,

22:35.272 --> 22:37.203
to the local television station there,

22:37.204 --> 22:38.771
which is in the process of rebooting.

22:38.772 --> 22:40.773
And what if Suarez Jr. gets there first?

22:40.774 --> 22:44.043
Well, that's a possibility.

22:44.044 --> 22:47.413
But... I think he's
playing a different game...

22:47.414 --> 22:48.715
waiting for your endorsement

22:48.716 --> 22:51.216
before he goes in front of the cameras.

22:52.051 --> 22:53.720
Well, any mission the U.S. undertakes

22:53.721 --> 22:55.521
to help Mr. Vela become president

22:55.522 --> 22:57.223
would have to be done with a deft touch.

22:57.224 --> 22:59.325
Or how about not at all?

22:59.326 --> 23:01.694
The U.S. can't risk
being seen as installing

23:01.695 --> 23:03.463
a puppet president in Caracas.

23:03.464 --> 23:05.131
This is in no way

23:05.132 --> 23:06.833
the Contras and the Sandinistas.

23:06.834 --> 23:08.701
We're not putting our
thumb on the scale,

23:08.702 --> 23:12.705
just delivering to the
Venezuelan people a...

23:12.706 --> 23:14.641
key part toward building

23:14.642 --> 23:17.410
their own scale.

23:17.411 --> 23:19.445
Well...

23:19.446 --> 23:21.881
Vela's no friend of the United States.

23:21.882 --> 23:24.150
He's been very vocal about it...

23:24.151 --> 23:25.885
so we got that going for us.

23:25.886 --> 23:27.887
He may not be a friend to the U.S.,

23:27.888 --> 23:30.890
but he is legitimate and a lot of lives

23:30.891 --> 23:32.525
would be saved if we help him.

23:32.526 --> 23:34.761
Would he help us free our hostages?

23:34.762 --> 23:37.864
We have every reason to
think that once he's in charge

23:37.865 --> 23:39.288
and he has the military behind him,

23:39.289 --> 23:41.167
he would want to free

23:41.168 --> 23:42.468
our doctors and nurses

23:42.469 --> 23:45.203
who have come to help his people.

23:46.339 --> 23:48.841
I know the intrusion
of political reality

23:48.842 --> 23:52.245
may not be welcome
here, but losing lives

23:52.246 --> 23:55.281
in a covert Venezuelan op...

23:55.282 --> 23:57.283
could cost us our already

23:57.284 --> 23:58.685
tenuous grasp on the election.

23:58.686 --> 24:02.220
I'm-I'm not... saying it's a factor.

24:03.323 --> 24:04.590
It's just a fact.

24:04.591 --> 24:07.126
Noted.

24:07.127 --> 24:08.761
But I can't let the election stop us

24:08.762 --> 24:10.262
from saving so many lives.

24:12.498 --> 24:15.233
Let's move on this.

24:22.929 --> 24:23.692
Hello.

24:23.693 --> 24:25.626
We're in here.

24:26.328 --> 24:29.098
Male bonding in my kitchen.

24:29.099 --> 24:31.300
I love that.

24:31.301 --> 24:33.631
Where's everybody else?

24:33.632 --> 24:34.415
Girls night.

24:34.416 --> 24:36.344
Something about pedicures and salad.

24:36.345 --> 24:37.446
Tempted as we were,

24:37.447 --> 24:39.681
we opted for leftovers and beer.

24:39.682 --> 24:40.816
Jason's upstairs,

24:40.817 --> 24:42.217
claiming to be doing his homework.

24:42.218 --> 24:44.653
He's probably gambling online.

24:44.654 --> 24:47.155
As long as he wins.

24:47.156 --> 24:48.857
What are you having?

24:48.858 --> 24:49.925
I wasn't sure

24:49.926 --> 24:51.960
I'd get to see you tonight, but...

24:51.961 --> 24:54.094
since you're here...

24:54.830 --> 24:56.798
I've decided not to take the job.

24:56.799 --> 24:59.000
I'm going to Venezuela
with my medical team.

24:59.001 --> 25:01.403
First of all, you're
not going to Venezuela

25:01.404 --> 25:04.272
because no aid is allowed in there yet.

25:04.273 --> 25:07.743
The State Department has
officially issued a warning

25:07.744 --> 25:09.567
against any U.S. citizen
entering the country.

25:09.568 --> 25:10.746
We consider ourselves warned.

25:10.747 --> 25:11.680
And second of all,

25:11.681 --> 25:14.349
you cannot do that to your family.

25:14.350 --> 25:16.685
To Sophie and Annie, but also to me.

25:16.686 --> 25:17.886
I-I went out on a limb

25:17.887 --> 25:19.287
to get you that job interview.

25:19.288 --> 25:21.823
The people at Walter Reed
were very understanding.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.625
So...

25:23.626 --> 25:25.260
- Of course they were.
- They were.

25:25.261 --> 25:29.131
Everybody's always
understanding of the big hero.

25:29.132 --> 25:30.832
'Cause they don't get to see what

25:30.833 --> 25:33.301
your choices cost everyone around you.

25:33.302 --> 25:35.904
Look, Henry seems to have
made his peace with letting go

25:35.905 --> 25:38.507
of being in the field,
but we're not the same guy.

25:38.508 --> 25:41.576
Henry puts himself at risk

25:41.577 --> 25:42.920
- more than you know.
- Elizabeth.

25:42.921 --> 25:44.045
But unlike you,

25:44.046 --> 25:46.615
he has an understanding of limits.

25:46.616 --> 25:47.679
Yeah, and he's right here.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.818
You know how Sophie feels.

25:49.819 --> 25:53.789
If you go back in the field,
she's going to leave you.

25:53.790 --> 25:56.023
You know that.

25:56.992 --> 25:58.226
You need to start calling

25:58.227 --> 25:59.227
this what it is.

25:59.228 --> 26:00.195
This is an addiction.

26:00.196 --> 26:02.030
Really?

26:02.031 --> 26:03.331
Is-Is that it?

26:03.332 --> 26:04.866
No, I couldn't be more serious, Will.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.333
You need help.

26:07.269 --> 26:10.005
So, when I go to work
in a dangerous situation,

26:10.006 --> 26:11.973
it's an addiction, but when you do it,

26:11.974 --> 26:13.341
it's a calling.

26:13.342 --> 26:17.579
I am not constantly
putting my life at risk.

26:17.580 --> 26:19.014
No, just half the time.

26:19.015 --> 26:20.782
Nearly getting yourself
blown up in Iran?

26:20.783 --> 26:21.783
That happened.

26:21.784 --> 26:24.019
And Henry just told
me about your stalker.

26:24.020 --> 26:25.153
Wow, you guys did

26:25.154 --> 26:27.097
- a lot of talking.
- Yeah, we had a family talk.

26:27.098 --> 26:28.957
I never imagined it
would be used against me.

26:28.958 --> 26:30.562
- Well, that's what Will does.
- I was using it

26:30.563 --> 26:32.708
- to illustrate a point, as family, that...
- Divide and conquer.

26:32.709 --> 26:34.663
- Okay.
- Anyone and anything is fair game.

26:34.664 --> 26:36.207
- You know what?
- As long as it serves

26:36.208 --> 26:37.899
his higher purpose.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.534
I don't want to fight about this.

26:39.535 --> 26:41.402
I'm going to Venezuela.

26:47.175 --> 26:48.977
Boy, here we go.

26:48.978 --> 26:50.178
I can't believe

26:50.179 --> 26:53.215
you're just walking out,
bailing on the whole thing.

26:53.216 --> 26:54.516
Just let it go.

26:55.651 --> 26:57.519
Mom and Dad would be so
disappointed right now.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.854
What?

26:58.855 --> 27:00.055
It's true.

27:00.056 --> 27:02.757
Don't-don't... You have

27:02.758 --> 27:06.061
no idea what letting
them down feels like.

27:06.062 --> 27:07.762
None.

27:07.763 --> 27:09.030
I was there.

27:09.031 --> 27:09.931
You weren't.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.733
Really? You want to do this?

27:11.734 --> 27:13.401
Okay, I wasn't there.

27:13.402 --> 27:14.636
I wasn't in the car.

27:14.637 --> 27:16.340
If I had been, maybe
they would have lived.

27:16.341 --> 27:17.672
Or maybe I.

27:17.673 --> 27:19.541
- That's...
- would have died, too, or instead.

27:19.542 --> 27:21.221
- That's not what I'm...
- Do you think that I haven't

27:21.222 --> 27:22.686
turned that scenario over in my mind

27:22.687 --> 27:24.446
- a million times?
- That is not

27:24.447 --> 27:25.968
- what I'm talking about.
- Then what?!

27:25.969 --> 27:27.112
What are you talking about?!

27:27.113 --> 27:29.359
I couldn't save her, all right?

27:32.654 --> 27:34.522
Mom died because of me,

27:34.523 --> 27:36.557
because I didn't know what to do.

27:38.193 --> 27:40.094
They died instantly.

27:42.063 --> 27:44.999
That was the story, but it's not true.

27:51.373 --> 27:53.508
She was still alive...

27:53.509 --> 27:56.176
for, I don't know, a few minutes.

27:57.279 --> 27:59.481
Just sitting there, staring at me.

27:59.482 --> 28:02.717
I-I used my sweatshirt

28:02.718 --> 28:04.052
to try and stop the bleeding,

28:04.053 --> 28:07.122
but it was pointless, so I...

28:07.123 --> 28:09.923
I just left to try and get some help.

28:11.726 --> 28:14.628
And by the time I came
back, she was gone.

28:17.732 --> 28:23.438
So, the last thing our
mother saw was me...

28:23.439 --> 28:26.073
failing her.

28:26.775 --> 28:29.610
You never told me.

28:34.950 --> 28:36.683
Why would I?

28:37.485 --> 28:40.387
Because it's the story of my life, too.

28:42.657 --> 28:45.527
Not that moment.

28:45.528 --> 28:46.928
That one...

28:48.965 --> 28:51.298
that one belongs to me.

29:04.145 --> 29:06.146
You gonna get that?

29:13.755 --> 29:17.592
I have to go, but I want
to talk about this later.

29:17.593 --> 29:19.860
Please, don't leave before we do.

29:24.233 --> 29:27.102
We've located

29:27.103 --> 29:28.069
Salvador Vela.

29:28.070 --> 29:30.705
He is safely hiding in a residence

29:30.706 --> 29:31.840
in El Junquito,

29:31.841 --> 29:33.742
which is about ten
miles west of Caracas.

29:33.743 --> 29:36.277
Good, so that's near
the television station.

29:36.278 --> 29:38.313
Except he's in no shape to be moved.

29:38.314 --> 29:40.115
I've spoken with our DEA units

29:40.116 --> 29:41.182
on the ground there

29:41.183 --> 29:43.051
and they've assessed his condition.

29:43.052 --> 29:46.287
He has a compound leg
fracture that he sustained

29:46.288 --> 29:48.089
when the Capitolio collapsed.

29:48.090 --> 29:51.760
It's vital that we get him
to declare the presidency.

29:51.761 --> 29:54.062
You're telling me there's no
way to secure his leg enough

29:54.063 --> 29:55.196
for a ten mile journey?

29:55.197 --> 29:57.899
If he had gotten immediate
medical care, maybe.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.335
He's got a high fever.

30:00.336 --> 30:01.836
He's in and out of consciousness.

30:01.837 --> 30:04.672
They gave him first aid,
but he needs a lot more

30:04.673 --> 30:07.242
than we can supply.

30:07.243 --> 30:09.310
Then what about abandoning this strategy

30:09.311 --> 30:11.379
and going directly for our hostages?

30:11.380 --> 30:12.414
Any progress

30:12.415 --> 30:14.315
- on where they're being held?
- None.

30:14.316 --> 30:16.818
Los HuÃ©rfanos is a gang that operates

30:16.819 --> 30:18.686
out of the slums of Caracas.

30:18.687 --> 30:20.321
They have no central hideout

30:20.322 --> 30:22.456
that we can ascertain.

30:23.391 --> 30:26.094
We're out of alternatives and time.

30:26.095 --> 30:27.429
So what?

30:27.430 --> 30:29.464
We just give Suarez Jr. what he wants?

30:29.465 --> 30:31.166
Maybe.

30:31.167 --> 30:33.668
As Russell said, when
there's no rule book,

30:33.669 --> 30:36.204
you don't have to worry
about breaking the rules.

30:36.205 --> 30:38.640
Sometimes I just say stuff.

30:38.641 --> 30:41.942
Yeah, but there's always
a little wisdom in it.

30:43.244 --> 30:44.712
I think you may be right, Bess.

30:44.713 --> 30:46.079
Seriously?

30:51.486 --> 30:53.321
Arabelle, hi.

30:53.322 --> 30:54.289
Hi, Nadine.

30:54.290 --> 30:55.356
I have good news for you.

30:55.357 --> 30:56.391
Carla's safe?

30:56.392 --> 30:57.392
Yes, she is.

30:57.393 --> 30:58.393
Well, she was injured,

30:58.394 --> 31:00.462
but she received treatment

31:00.463 --> 31:01.696
at a local clinic

31:01.697 --> 31:03.264
and she'll make a full recovery.

31:03.265 --> 31:04.799
I'm so relieved.

31:04.800 --> 31:06.133
Thank you.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.437
As I said, she's like family.

31:09.438 --> 31:13.007
And I appreciate you taking
the time to do this for me.

31:13.008 --> 31:14.843
Well, I was glad to help.

31:14.844 --> 31:18.680
Actually... I was happy to be able

31:18.681 --> 31:20.081
to do something for you.

31:21.317 --> 31:22.816
Why is that?

31:24.119 --> 31:26.688
Well...

31:26.689 --> 31:31.426
I feel like we fell out of communication

31:31.427 --> 31:34.028
after Vincent passed.

31:34.029 --> 31:36.798
And... it was so...

31:36.799 --> 31:41.202
well, it was... such an abrupt end.

31:41.203 --> 31:45.639
We never really... got a chance to talk.

31:47.542 --> 31:51.746
Well, the truth is, it's painful
for me to be around you, Nadine.

31:51.747 --> 31:53.414
I'm sorry.

31:53.415 --> 31:56.251
When the scandal hit, I was blindsided.

31:56.252 --> 31:58.086
I felt so ashamed,

31:58.087 --> 31:59.888
realizing I didn't know my husband

31:59.889 --> 32:01.256
the way I thought I did.

32:01.257 --> 32:04.125
But the idea that he was a conspirator

32:04.126 --> 32:05.226
in this rogue operation

32:05.227 --> 32:08.129
to blow up the Iran peace deal...

32:08.130 --> 32:09.430
covert meetings,

32:09.431 --> 32:11.833
secret bank accounts, all of it...

32:11.834 --> 32:13.801
and I didn't have a clue.

32:16.672 --> 32:18.939
Well...

32:20.608 --> 32:25.113
what you need to
remember is that he died

32:25.114 --> 32:26.414
trying to do the right thing.

32:26.415 --> 32:30.251
He was a good man who took a wrong turn

32:30.252 --> 32:32.854
for idealistic reasons,

32:32.855 --> 32:36.558
no matter how misguided they were.

32:36.559 --> 32:40.261
He lost his bearings a little...

32:40.262 --> 32:45.667
but that didn't change
everything about who he was.

32:45.668 --> 32:47.835
Yes.

32:47.836 --> 32:49.936
That's right.

32:50.838 --> 32:54.141
But it also doesn't
change how blind I was.

32:56.778 --> 32:59.079
You loved him.

33:00.181 --> 33:02.983
And we know what they say about that.

33:09.057 --> 33:12.326
Nadine, is there anything
else I need to know?

33:14.095 --> 33:16.130
No.

33:16.131 --> 33:18.398
There isn't.

33:20.134 --> 33:22.436
Well.

33:26.574 --> 33:28.875
Thank you, again.

33:30.378 --> 33:32.946
For your time.

33:34.716 --> 33:36.050
Take care.

33:39.788 --> 33:42.857
Venezuela faces a crucial
time in its history,

33:42.858 --> 33:46.461
and every crucial time
requires a capable leader.

33:46.462 --> 33:48.963
With President Francisco Suarez Jr.

33:48.964 --> 33:51.299
Taking the helm as
Venezuela's new president,

33:51.300 --> 33:54.802
we anticipate that the recovery
from this natural disaster

33:54.803 --> 33:58.406
will be handled with
supreme care and expediency.

33:58.407 --> 34:00.642
God Bless the people of Venezuela.

34:00.643 --> 34:02.110
As to be expected,

34:02.111 --> 34:03.544
Dalton's opponents in the election

34:03.545 --> 34:05.480
wasted no time in reacting.

34:05.481 --> 34:09.183
Once again, we see just how
weak President Dalton is.

34:09.184 --> 34:12.219
Anointing the first
person who claims his name

34:12.221 --> 34:15.523
is Suarez to the position of president.

34:15.524 --> 34:17.091
President Dalton once again

34:17.092 --> 34:19.260
demonstrates just how tone deaf he is

34:19.261 --> 34:22.763
to the rest of the world.
What about the Venezuelan...

34:31.739 --> 34:33.574
Mr. President...

34:33.574 --> 34:34.909
the hostages.

34:34.909 --> 34:36.610
We have to work on

34:36.612 --> 34:37.995
getting them released immediately.

34:37.996 --> 34:40.148
I am a man of my word.

34:40.149 --> 34:41.947
Tell your president I said that.

34:42.949 --> 34:46.219
The hostages will be at
Charallave airport in an hour.

35:04.939 --> 35:06.674
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

35:06.675 --> 35:08.809
Come on, everybody!

35:09.510 --> 35:11.679
Congratulations, gentlemen.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.081
Some of your finest work

35:13.082 --> 35:14.415
performed for an audience of one.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.651
You're much more relaxed when speaking

35:16.652 --> 35:17.952
to an imaginary press, Conrad.

35:17.953 --> 35:19.520
I have to say, I'm more than

35:19.521 --> 35:21.356
a little unnerved by
both your acting skills.

35:21.357 --> 35:24.359
Well, we have to send a
special thanks to CYBERCOM.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.694
'Cause of their signal
jamming, there was no chance

35:26.695 --> 35:29.197
Suarez Jr. could check
with the outside world

35:29.198 --> 35:32.400
on our little, fake news report.

35:32.401 --> 35:35.069
Well, I think this
demonstrates what we can achieve

35:35.070 --> 35:37.405
when we come together for
common goals and values.

35:37.406 --> 35:40.675
Some things do rise above the
level of partisan politics,

35:40.676 --> 35:43.111
like being blackmailed by a common thug.

35:43.112 --> 35:46.547
Hear, hear. Hostages
saved, dictatorship averted.

35:46.548 --> 35:48.483
We're still working
on that last part.

35:48.484 --> 35:49.484
Thanks again, gentlemen.

35:49.485 --> 35:51.145
- Mr. President.
- Sir.

35:52.754 --> 35:56.224
DEA reports Junior's still
holed up in his bunker,

35:56.225 --> 35:59.560
but now he's sending out gang
members to summon the press.

35:59.561 --> 36:03.297
We might not have long before
he realizes he's been duped

36:03.298 --> 36:05.967
and makes a run at the
state television station.

36:05.968 --> 36:08.202
So, how are we going to get aid to Vela

36:08.203 --> 36:10.871
so he can get well
enough to get there first?

36:11.939 --> 36:14.942
It could just be a matter of
turning a helicopter around.

36:14.943 --> 36:17.111
- What? The hostages?
- They're all ready to go.

36:17.112 --> 36:19.180
We just pulled them
from the jaws of death.

36:19.181 --> 36:21.416
Can we really ask them to go back in?

36:21.417 --> 36:24.585
From what I know about guys like this...

36:24.586 --> 36:27.254
we may not even have to ask.

36:36.995 --> 36:38.530
Hi, Daddy.

36:38.531 --> 36:40.497
Hey, sweet pea.

36:42.902 --> 36:44.837
You know I'm... I'm leaving today.

36:44.838 --> 36:47.138
Yes.

36:49.475 --> 36:52.612
I'm gonna be gone for awhile, but...

36:52.613 --> 36:55.281
you know I love you.

36:55.282 --> 36:58.083
I love you, too.

37:00.119 --> 37:02.388
Come here.

37:02.389 --> 37:04.223
Oop...

37:04.224 --> 37:06.092
There are...

37:06.093 --> 37:08.427
sick people,

37:08.428 --> 37:11.564
who need daddy's help,
you know that, right?

37:11.565 --> 37:15.201
Otherwise, there's nothing
that would make me leave you

37:15.202 --> 37:17.069
or your mother.

37:17.070 --> 37:19.371
I know. Bye, Daddy.

38:16.295 --> 38:17.496
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

38:17.497 --> 38:18.880
I'm doing a quick load of laundry.

38:18.881 --> 38:20.800
Do you want to throw anything in?

38:20.801 --> 38:22.264
No, thanks. Do you know where it is?

38:22.265 --> 38:24.465
Yeah.

38:25.071 --> 38:26.704
Hey.

38:29.175 --> 38:30.209
Where's Will?

38:30.210 --> 38:31.577
You just missed him.

38:31.578 --> 38:33.579
I did?

38:33.580 --> 38:35.448
He's flying out to Venezuela.

38:35.449 --> 38:38.516
Annie and I are packing
to go back to London.

38:39.652 --> 38:41.387
Sophie, I'm so sorry.

38:41.388 --> 38:42.555
Don't be.

38:42.556 --> 38:43.889
To be honest,

38:43.890 --> 38:46.492
I never really thought the
whole job thing would happen.

38:46.493 --> 38:48.994
But I appreciate everything you did.

38:48.995 --> 38:51.397
Mind if I get tucked into the wine

38:51.398 --> 38:52.932
while I do this?

38:52.933 --> 38:54.734
Help yourself.

38:54.735 --> 38:57.101
Thank you.

39:00.673 --> 39:03.041
I can't believe he left.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.847
Did you try and stop him?

39:07.848 --> 39:09.615
No.

39:09.616 --> 39:11.684
Look, maybe it's time
we just let him be.

39:11.685 --> 39:14.519
He knows what's at stake.
We did the best we could.

39:19.325 --> 39:23.262
Or, you might still be
able to catch him. Go.

39:23.263 --> 39:25.331
Just like that? Chase
him to the airport?

39:25.332 --> 39:26.465
Yeah. He's your brother.

39:26.466 --> 39:29.435
I love you.

39:29.436 --> 39:31.203
- I love you, too.
- Okay.

39:38.210 --> 39:41.313
There's a military aid
transport, leaving for Caracas.

39:41.314 --> 39:44.716
Yes ma'am. It just
took off at 2100 hours.

39:52.024 --> 39:53.692
You missed your flight?

39:53.693 --> 39:55.960
- Couldn't go.
- Why not?

39:57.730 --> 40:00.299
When I said good-bye to Annie,

40:00.300 --> 40:03.135
she wasn't upset.

40:03.136 --> 40:05.237
Made no impression on her,

40:05.238 --> 40:07.506
and she wasn't masking her pain.

40:07.507 --> 40:09.508
She was just used to.

40:09.509 --> 40:12.011
Daddy going away.

40:12.012 --> 40:14.480
That's her life.

40:14.481 --> 40:15.815
So...

40:15.816 --> 40:18.918
for the first time ever,
when I got ready to board,

40:18.919 --> 40:21.287
I thought, you know what?

40:21.288 --> 40:23.655
Let someone else do it.

40:26.725 --> 40:30.061
I think it's okay to pass the mantle.

40:31.931 --> 40:35.266
You've saved enough people for a while.

40:37.069 --> 40:39.971
And none of them are ever gonna be Mom.

40:40.706 --> 40:43.742
No. They never are.

40:43.743 --> 40:46.178
I'm so sorry that...

40:46.179 --> 40:48.380
you had to...

40:48.381 --> 40:50.749
go through this alone,
and I'm mad at myself

40:50.750 --> 40:52.451
for not figuring it out, I...

40:52.452 --> 40:55.888
With what? Your magical CIA skills?

40:55.889 --> 40:57.723
No.

40:57.724 --> 41:00.192
With my magical big sister skills.

41:00.193 --> 41:03.929
- It was my job to take care of you.
- Yeah.

41:03.930 --> 41:07.199
Well, I was trying to take care of you.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.535
I just didn't think it
was something that you

41:09.536 --> 41:10.903
needed to know.

41:10.904 --> 41:13.005
I've never really been
able to give you anything,

41:13.006 --> 41:15.273
except that.

41:16.475 --> 41:19.178
- That's not a gift, Will.
- I know.

41:19.179 --> 41:22.381
It's a plan that a stupid,
traumatized 13-year-old

41:22.382 --> 41:24.450
came up with, and for some reason,

41:24.451 --> 41:27.419
I was still carrying it around.

41:27.420 --> 41:28.821
Well, return it.

41:28.822 --> 41:32.024
I'd rather have something from the Gap.

41:32.025 --> 41:34.527
You know, last night,

41:34.528 --> 41:36.529
when the three of us were fighting,

41:36.530 --> 41:39.999
it felt s... distantly familiar.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.469
And I thought, this is weird,
all these messy feelings

41:43.470 --> 41:46.305
flying around... what is it?

41:46.306 --> 41:48.274
And then I remembered,

41:48.275 --> 41:51.076
like going back in a time machine,

41:51.077 --> 41:53.412
that this is family.

41:53.413 --> 41:56.615
And I've been running
from it my whole life

41:56.616 --> 41:59.752
because I'm afraid of losing it.

41:59.753 --> 42:02.053
Again.

42:04.557 --> 42:06.791
You're not gonna lose us.

42:07.793 --> 42:10.329
Sophie on the other hand...

42:10.330 --> 42:11.397
I know.

42:11.398 --> 42:13.332
I called her.

42:13.333 --> 42:15.834
The woman... she's crazy.

42:15.835 --> 42:18.137
For some reason, she still loves me,

42:18.138 --> 42:21.472
at least enough to have the discussion.

42:22.107 --> 42:24.809
Maybe we can work it out.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.617
I don't believe the last thing Mom saw

42:31.618 --> 42:34.052
was you failing her.

42:35.654 --> 42:39.457
The last thing she saw
was that you were okay.

42:40.659 --> 42:44.162
And she knew that we
would have each other.

42:45.898 --> 42:48.267
I think she was all right,

42:48.268 --> 42:50.268
knowing that.
