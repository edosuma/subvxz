08:16.914 --> 08:19.731
For her to snap at you, mary,
it actually makes me feel like

08:19.750 --> 08:21.750
lisa must be going through
a lot or something.

08:21.785 --> 08:23.902
Well, I snapped at her first,
and I went in.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.337
I just went all the way in
because--

08:25.372 --> 08:28.907
yeah. You're sick of the
passive-aggressive little jokes.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.275
You know, it triggered,

08:30.310 --> 08:32.844
and I didn't really realize
that was there

08:32.880 --> 08:35.447
until she said it again,
and then she's like,

08:35.482 --> 08:36.848
boom, and it came out.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.767
Why does lisa trigger you?

08:38.802 --> 08:40.435
You're gonna make me cry,
you know.

08:40.470 --> 08:42.220
Yeah.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.692
Lisa... [crying]

08:47.728 --> 08:51.146
when you question me,
it just triggers.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.448
I lost someone over that.
Don't question my--

08:53.483 --> 08:57.035
don't question what I'm saying.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.204
My mom was my friend,
I thought,

08:59.239 --> 09:03.608
heather, that was
my best friend, you know?

09:03.644 --> 09:05.460
So I thought whatever I chose,

09:05.495 --> 09:09.748
she knew that I was capable
of handling the right choice.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.884
I lost my mom 'cause I knew
I was right,

09:12.920 --> 09:14.469
and I wasn't backing down.

09:14.504 --> 09:16.471
She cut me off.

09:16.506 --> 09:18.089
What--
was there a specific issue?

09:18.124 --> 09:19.891
-It was robert sr.
-Robert sr.?

09:19.927 --> 09:21.059
Mm-hmm. Yeah, mainly.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.126
She didn't want you
to marry him?

09:22.145 --> 09:24.029
No.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.849
When my grandmother passed
and I married robert sr.,

09:27.901 --> 09:30.802
my mom wanted everything that,
you know, she felt like

09:30.821 --> 09:32.020
that her mom--it was her mom

09:32.072 --> 09:34.189
and that she should've been
next in line,

09:34.241 --> 09:36.191
that she should've had
the church,

09:36.243 --> 09:40.829
and when we felt like that
wasn't the will of god,

09:40.864 --> 09:42.998
she just, like, cut me off,

09:43.033 --> 09:47.151
was like, "I deserve that.
You don't."

09:47.170 --> 09:49.153
she wanted the security and
the lifestyle and the money...

09:49.172 --> 09:50.321
-I don't know.
-...And the things that

09:50.340 --> 09:52.173
robert sr. Could provide, so...
-She wanted to be you.

09:52.209 --> 09:53.458
It was bizarre.

09:53.493 --> 09:56.044
When we departed, and I haven't
spoke to her in 25 years,

09:56.096 --> 09:59.965
it was because she didn't
believe what I said.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.051
So when people question me
like lisa, like,

10:03.103 --> 10:05.220
"oh, let me google
what mary said,"

10:05.272 --> 10:08.056
then it takes me back
to that wound.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.941
I mean, does your mom
want resolve?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.443
-No.
-She doesn't want--

10:11.478 --> 10:13.244
no, and that's--I think
that's what hurts the most.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.229
-Yeah, of course.
-You have other siblings, right?

10:14.281 --> 10:15.113
Mm-hmm.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.732
I have a sister
and three brothers.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.900
Did most of your family
go with your mom,

10:18.952 --> 10:20.151
or is it still divided?

10:20.186 --> 10:21.987
One of my brothers
went with my mom.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.822
Is there anything
that could bring resolve?

10:23.857 --> 10:27.292
No. Yeah. But it's fine.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.028
But you navigated it,
and you came out on top.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.698
And you--you've taken a lot
of sh-- from our friends,

10:33.734 --> 10:36.200
you know, and you held strong
and you've been forgiving.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.252
Well, I mean, with lisa,

10:37.304 --> 10:40.105
I clearly have to do
a little work.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.140
Do you think her feelings
are--are hurt,

10:42.175 --> 10:44.208
or do you think she's just...
-Well, I mean, it's the same

10:44.227 --> 10:47.846
as saying, "okay, I'm good."
but you're not good. It's lisa.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.148
I think that lisa's friendship
with you

10:50.183 --> 10:53.568
is probably contingent
with how much she thinks

10:53.603 --> 10:55.320
you're on team lisa.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.857
It's gonna be a matter of
if you "fall back into line."

10:58.892 --> 11:00.492
lisa looks at everything
as a game,

11:00.527 --> 11:04.112
and everything's a strategy,
and every move is calculated.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.247
And so as long as she believes
that mary's on team lisa,

11:06.283 --> 11:08.133
there won't be a problem.

11:08.168 --> 11:12.454
But if you cross her,
lisa will reveal herself.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.072
