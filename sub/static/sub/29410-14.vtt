00:03.046 --> 00:05.005
MARTIN:
So what's your new paper about?

00:05.048 --> 00:08.008
"Deviations in Modus Operandi."

00:08.051 --> 00:09.487
Sophomoric topic.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.663
Well, I am a sophomore.

00:11.707 --> 00:14.014
[chuckles]

00:14.057 --> 00:16.059
Serial killers tend to be
fairly consistent

00:16.103 --> 00:17.669
in their modality.

00:17.713 --> 00:20.890
Berkowitz had "women who
looked like his mother."

00:20.933 --> 00:23.849
Kemper had coeds,
decapitations and...

00:23.893 --> 00:25.155
Please, son, not before lunch.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.027
[Bright laughs]

00:27.070 --> 00:31.248
-You had your scalpel.
-Like any artist,
I had my themes.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.424
But I also experimented.

00:33.468 --> 00:38.038
So you would sometimes
improvise?

00:38.081 --> 00:40.649
A little free-form jazz.

00:41.911 --> 00:42.868
Yeah, often.

00:42.912 --> 00:45.436
That's interesting.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.526
Improvisational murder.

00:48.570 --> 00:53.183
Which--
which raises the question,

00:53.227 --> 00:56.404
if you were going
to kill me right now,

00:56.447 --> 00:57.535
how would you do it?

00:57.579 --> 01:00.712
Oh, geez, son...

01:00.756 --> 01:02.236
what a morbid thought.

01:02.279 --> 01:07.154
I'm afraid my options are
a tad restricted.

01:10.113 --> 01:12.855
If you weren't cuffed.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.729
Come on, my professor would
love to know your thoughts.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.776
Well, that's a tricky one.

01:20.819 --> 01:23.779
Perhaps I'd just bash your skull
into the table.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.955
You know, one swift strike
and it's done.

01:29.872 --> 01:33.745
Maybe that loose screw
on the table behind me.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.443
Jamming that into
your carotid artery

01:35.486 --> 01:36.748
would do the trick.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.750
Though it might get
a little messy.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.579
Um, I could plow it
into your eye socket.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.103
Go for the frontal lobe.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.279
Turn you off
like a light switch.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.760
[laughs]

01:48.804 --> 01:51.589
But this is nonsense.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.114
-I could never hurt you.
-Why?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.290
Because you're--
because you're my son.

01:59.641 --> 02:03.123
I mean, could you kill me?

02:09.651 --> 02:11.609
No.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.481
No. Of course not.

02:15.657 --> 02:19.182
Right, right. Of course not.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.184
â™ª

02:24.231 --> 02:25.841
JESSICA:
To your first day reporting

02:25.884 --> 02:27.973
from the studio!
Now you don't have

02:28.017 --> 02:29.323
to pound the pavement
like some salesman

02:29.366 --> 02:32.152
-or census taker.
-BRIGHT: Yes.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.023
-To Ainsley.
-AINSLEY: Aw.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.808
Anderson Cooper is
shaking in his boots.

02:36.852 --> 02:40.029
And I am so proud
of you, too, Malcolm.

02:40.072 --> 02:43.815
No murders for two weeks.
It's a new record.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.991
Are you glad you went
on your vacation after all?

02:46.035 --> 02:50.909
I did miss the work,
but it was nice to get away.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.303
I shut the drapes
and never left my room.

02:53.347 --> 02:54.478
Just me and my books.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.350
On your tropical holiday?

02:57.351 --> 02:59.831
When you say "get away,"

02:59.875 --> 03:01.485
I take it you mean
from your father.

03:01.529 --> 03:04.358
In which case, might I suggest
a permanent vacation?

03:05.924 --> 03:08.666
We seem to be entering
the "daddy issues" segment

03:08.710 --> 03:12.017
of this meal, which is
my cue to go to work.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.890
-Love you.
-Bye. Bye.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.762
Really, Malcolm, you haven't
seen him in two weeks,

03:17.806 --> 03:19.329
and you seem great.

03:19.373 --> 03:22.506
I'm not exactly rushing
to Claremont,

03:22.550 --> 03:25.857
but there are some things
that were left unresolved.

03:25.901 --> 03:27.337
BRIGHT:
You were going to kill me.

03:27.381 --> 03:31.080
I have done bad things,
but I never did that.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.690
Like what?

03:32.734 --> 03:34.257
I mean, you can tell me.

03:34.301 --> 03:37.521
I-I feel sure I've heard
everything by now.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.741
It's complicated.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.047
What are you doing after this?

03:42.091 --> 03:43.875
Just errands.

03:43.919 --> 03:46.878
You, you don't run errands.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.880
[sighs]

03:48.924 --> 03:51.143
Fine.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.188
I'm meeting someone.

03:53.929 --> 03:56.453
They claim to know something
about the girl in the box.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.933
It came from the tip line.

03:59.587 --> 04:03.068
And you were going to meet
this total stranger alone?

04:03.112 --> 04:05.375
Yes.

04:05.419 --> 04:06.724
[exhales sharply]

04:06.768 --> 04:09.510
Until my meddling son
got involved.

04:12.948 --> 04:15.167
Well, I don't see anyone.

04:15.211 --> 04:18.170
He said he'd be wearing
a blue sweater.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.738
Did he say by the carousel

04:20.782 --> 04:23.915
or onthe carousel?

04:23.959 --> 04:25.743
Oh...

04:25.787 --> 04:28.790
[thunder rumbling]

04:35.362 --> 04:38.278
[carousel music playing]

04:38.321 --> 04:40.105
[Jessica stammers]

04:40.149 --> 04:42.151
Stay here.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.160
Hello?

04:51.203 --> 04:53.641
Anybody here?

04:55.469 --> 04:58.298
[music slowing]

05:01.170 --> 05:02.650
Don't look!

05:04.652 --> 05:06.001
[screams]

05:15.663 --> 05:18.013
Malcolm!

05:34.899 --> 05:36.814
I knew this vacation
wouldn't last.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.163
Be honest.
Did you kill this guy

05:38.207 --> 05:39.469
just so you could
get back to work?

05:39.513 --> 05:42.385
This one fell in my lap.
Tell them, Mother.

05:42.429 --> 05:45.083
-What are you looking for?
-My purse.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.999
I dropped it when...
Forget it.

05:48.043 --> 05:50.828
Uh, this gentleman was
supposed to give us information

05:50.872 --> 05:52.090
on the girl in the box.

05:53.875 --> 05:54.832
Who's the vic?

05:54.876 --> 05:56.486
That's gonna be tough.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.661
His fingerprints were burned off
postmortem.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.010
DNA's gonna take some time.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.143
Hey, you stole my thunder.
[chuckles]

06:02.536 --> 06:05.016
It's okay,
I've got plenty of thunder.

06:05.060 --> 06:08.019
He died by exsanguination
from the carotid artery,

06:08.063 --> 06:09.760
aka a slit throat.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.849
Which may be metaphorically
significant.

06:11.893 --> 06:14.417
A silencing of sorts.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.593
Any idea who'd want
to silence your informant?

06:16.637 --> 06:19.117
Well, yes, but he's rotting
in a cell.

06:19.161 --> 06:22.599
Not-- not rotting.
More like flourishing.

06:22.643 --> 06:23.948
You're saying Martin Whitly
is somehow behind this?

06:23.992 --> 06:26.951
With that man,
anything is possible.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.300
So you think we should
question your dad?

06:28.344 --> 06:29.258
No, I don't.

06:30.564 --> 06:33.393
I mean... not yet.

06:33.436 --> 06:36.091
Martin Whitly's psychopathic.
He's not superhuman.

06:36.134 --> 06:39.094
It's also unnecessary
'cause you're completely wrong.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.532
Sorry, that came out harsher
than I intended.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.405
I was going for, like,
a playful repartee.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.232
Have I mentioned
how much I missed you?

06:47.276 --> 06:50.105
-[Edrisa chuckles]
-You'll get used to it.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.892
I missed you, too.
Now tell me

06:54.936 --> 06:56.807
why I'm completely wrong.

06:56.851 --> 06:57.939
He died last night.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.723
You know, based on the lividity,

06:59.767 --> 07:02.552
he spent several hours on
his side, in a fetal position.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.032
Like in the trunk of a car.

07:08.210 --> 07:11.561
But the call came in
to the tip line this morning.

07:11.605 --> 07:15.304
Which means our killer
was the one who called you.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.959
He wanted you to find the body.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.920
LESLIE:
Ainsley.

07:22.964 --> 07:24.487
Ainsley, we're throwing
to you next.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.098
-I thought Rod was up.
-We're breaking in.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.274
The body they found
on the carousel--

07:29.318 --> 07:31.451
we've got somebody on the line
claiming to be the killer.

07:31.494 --> 07:34.802
And they want to talk to you
on the air right now.

07:34.845 --> 07:39.502
Well, um... are-are you sure
it's not a hoax? I mean,

07:39.546 --> 07:41.373
-I don't want to get
Baba Booey'd the first day.
-Trust me.

07:41.417 --> 07:42.940
Trust me, we ran it down.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.465
The caller knew the victim's
prints were burned off.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.118
That hasn't been made public.

07:47.162 --> 07:49.991
A-And no one's concerned
about the ethics of all this?

07:50.034 --> 07:52.689
I mean, putting a, a killer
live on the air?

07:52.733 --> 07:56.127
That's an interesting position
coming from you.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.912
I just...

07:59.566 --> 08:02.873
Look, he says if we don't
do this, others will die.

08:02.917 --> 08:06.790
I got the lawyers on the phone
with the FCC and NYPD.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.836
If you want,
I'll give it to James.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.185
But he wants you.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.578
We're set to go.

08:14.537 --> 08:15.799
Okay.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.672
I'm going to need
a fact sheet ASAP,

08:18.715 --> 08:23.024
and, uh, call Gil Arroyo
at Major Crimes.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.808
He's gonna want to see this.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.462
Thank you.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.641
-FLOOR MANAGER: Five, four...
-[Ainsley clears throat]

08:31.685 --> 08:32.816

08:32.860 --> 08:35.253
[intro music plays]

08:35.297 --> 08:36.820
Welcome back.

08:36.864 --> 08:39.388
I'm Ainsley Whitly interrupting
our regular programming

08:39.431 --> 08:41.651
with an unusual caller
on the line.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.262
A man claiming responsibility
for a murder

08:44.306 --> 08:46.656
that occurred this morning
in Queens.

08:46.700 --> 08:47.918
Are you there?

08:47.962 --> 08:50.834
[static buzzing]

08:50.878 --> 08:52.532
DISTORTED VOICE:
Hello, Ainsley.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.449
Hello.
Who am I speaking with?

08:57.493 --> 08:59.277
I am the Carousel Killer.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.192
Catchy.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.194
I have two questions for you.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.848
Why did you kill
that man this morning,

09:04.892 --> 09:06.676
and why are you calling us
about it?

09:06.720 --> 09:08.678
So you would all take heed.

09:08.722 --> 09:12.203
AINSLEY:
Well, you have our attention.
Now what?

09:12.247 --> 09:14.292
When he called the tip line,
he didn't leave a name?

09:14.336 --> 09:15.859
[door opens]

09:15.903 --> 09:17.426
You got to see this.

09:20.429 --> 09:21.735
Oh, who picked out that blazer?

09:21.778 --> 09:23.867
She looks like the carpet
at the DMV.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.782
AINSLEY:
You didn't answer my question.

09:25.826 --> 09:27.088
Why did you kill that man?

09:27.131 --> 09:28.698
I chose him at random

09:28.742 --> 09:30.700
to let everyone know
I'm serious.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.572
Is this live?

09:32.615 --> 09:33.877
The killer called in
a few minutes ago.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.575
AINSLEY:
Serious about what?

09:35.618 --> 09:37.620
CAROUSEL KILLER:
Your mother Jessica Whitly.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.144
She went on TV and offered
a million dollars

09:40.188 --> 09:42.494
for information about one
of her husband's victims.

09:42.538 --> 09:45.062
-I'm aware.
-Like she's some kind of hero.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.630
But she's not.
She's a fraud and a hypocrite.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.414
My mother is neither
of those things.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.721
[laughs] The chickens
are coming home to roost.

09:51.765 --> 09:52.766
-[slams desk]
-What...?

09:55.551 --> 09:56.813
What, exactly, do you want?

09:56.857 --> 09:58.162
I want that money.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.251
I'll call back
with instructions.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.776
If she doesn't listen,
more people will die.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.299
-[line clicks]
-Wha...

10:09.957 --> 10:12.612
No good deed goes unpunished.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.092
If I hadn't gone on TV,
I hadn't offered that money...

10:15.136 --> 10:16.833
You can't think like that.

10:16.877 --> 10:20.097
Why? The killer just
announced it

10:20.141 --> 10:21.446
to millions of people.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.623
-That man is dead because of me.
-No.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.537
He's dead because
someone killed him,

10:25.581 --> 10:27.104
not you.

10:27.148 --> 10:28.932
You were just trying to do
some actual good.

10:28.976 --> 10:32.457
I want to pay.
It is a small price

10:32.501 --> 10:34.677
to ensure that
no more lives are lost.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.113
NYPD policy is firm.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.289
We do not cooperate
with extortionists.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.770
-I don't give a flying...
-BRIGHT: Mother!

10:40.814 --> 10:42.946
Gil's right. We'll send
an officer to the house.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.166
The smartest thing you can do
right now is go home

10:45.209 --> 10:46.646
and let us do our jobs.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.649
Please.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.172
[sighs]

11:02.836 --> 11:04.794
You know, I have
to tell you, Mr. David,

11:04.838 --> 11:08.972
I am... really
taking to clay time.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.322
You know, I think it would be
even more therapeutic, though,

11:11.366 --> 11:13.673
if I had the, the proper
implements, huh?

11:13.716 --> 11:15.587
Is there any chance I could get
a fettling knife?

11:15.631 --> 11:18.242
Well, you lost me at knife.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.332
Well, then my hands

11:21.376 --> 11:23.334
will just have to suffice.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.162
Ready for your TV time?

11:25.206 --> 11:29.340
Ooh, I never say no to TV time.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.386
AINSLEY:
Authorities have not released
the victim's identity,

11:31.429 --> 11:33.257
-but have...
-Oh, look at that.

11:33.301 --> 11:36.043
My little girl's reporting
from the studio now.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.088
AINSLEY: The killer asked
to speak to me directly

11:38.132 --> 11:41.265
and proceeded to levy
unfounded accusations

11:41.309 --> 11:43.920
about my family,
specifically my mother

11:43.964 --> 11:46.009
Jessica Whitly, on air.

11:46.053 --> 11:48.708
-Oh, my.
-It should come as no surprise
that my father...

11:48.751 --> 11:51.188
-Oh, this looks very exciting.
-...Martin Whitly,
also known as The Surgeon,

11:51.232 --> 11:53.843
has been in the news before.

11:53.887 --> 11:58.456
He was arrested in 1998
for murdering 23 people.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.241
The Carousel Killer...

12:01.242 --> 12:03.592
I know you're worried.

12:03.635 --> 12:07.161
Best thing we can do for them
is to catch this guy.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.906
Ransom killers
are most often motivated

12:12.949 --> 12:14.559
-by financial gain.
-Could this be

12:14.603 --> 12:16.431
a crime of opportunity?
Someone sees a million bucks

12:16.474 --> 12:18.041
offered up on TV
and they jump on it?

12:18.085 --> 12:19.651
That explains the hasty M.O.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.741
Slitting a throat is simple,
straightforward.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.743
You're right. The killer
didn't savor the murder.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.441
This isn't any
sort of paraphilia.

12:26.484 --> 12:29.313
And the money is definitely
part of it,

12:29.357 --> 12:31.402
but it's not only
about the money.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.143
He wanted everyone
to hear his demands.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.754
-He's after the notoriety.
-BRIGHT: Yes.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.103
Except he didn't call
a random newscast.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.757
He called Ainsley,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.889
told her "the chickens
are coming home to roost,"

12:39.933 --> 12:41.761
and then demanded money
from our mother.

12:41.804 --> 12:45.590
This killer has been wronged
by the Whitlys.

12:45.634 --> 12:47.244
DANI:
Okay, well, we're gonna
need a list

12:47.288 --> 12:48.898
of all the people connected
to your father's victims.

12:48.942 --> 12:50.682
That's a long-ass list.

12:50.726 --> 12:52.162
-No offense.
-None taken.

12:52.206 --> 12:54.774
-Start with the Lehrer brothers.
-Who?

12:54.817 --> 12:56.601
GIL:
The Surgeon killed
their mother in '96,

12:56.645 --> 12:58.778
but he wasn't connected
with the crime for three years.

12:58.821 --> 13:01.258
In the meantime
they went to jail for it.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.999
BRIGHT:
My mother offered them
a settlement.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.522
She wanted to help them.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.786
They insisted on a jury trial
and lost.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.918
Financially motivated
with a personal vendetta.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.355
-That fits.
-GIL: JT and I will take them.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.315
Dani, you and Bright
get down to ADN.

13:19.494 --> 13:22.497
[carousel music playing]

13:27.328 --> 13:30.200
Change of plans, Adolpho.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.376
Take me to the bank.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.335
BRIGHT:
When he calls back,
you need to keep him on the line

13:34.378 --> 13:36.641
as long as possible.
Let him ramble.

13:36.685 --> 13:38.861
Don't interrupt.
Try to tease out any details

13:38.905 --> 13:39.949
about his past.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.646
Oh. You mean, be a journalist?

13:41.690 --> 13:43.866
I went to Columbia
J School, Malcolm,

13:43.910 --> 13:45.563
I know how
to conduct an interview.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.304
This is different.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.871
-You're dealing
with an active killer.
-Yeah, well,

13:48.915 --> 13:51.178
interviewing killers
is kind of my thing now, so...

13:52.222 --> 13:54.659
-Joking.
-This is a bad idea.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.966
Okay, don't big brother me,
Malcolm.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.490
-I can handle it.
-You're not trained for this.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.405
These people
can get under your skin.

14:01.449 --> 14:04.582
Oh, I see we're going
for maximum irony here.

14:04.626 --> 14:07.324
Do you think this is how I saw
my first day going?

14:07.368 --> 14:10.153
I did not ask to be put
in the center of a crisis,

14:10.197 --> 14:12.503
but I am here,
so I'm gonna do whatever I can

14:12.547 --> 14:15.680
to help you catch this guy.
Cool?

14:15.724 --> 14:17.160
-Fine.
-[sighs]

14:17.204 --> 14:19.597
Yeah.
Let's do this.

14:21.643 --> 14:24.341
-NEWSMAN: A deranged killer
called into...
-JT: Ari Lehrer.

14:24.385 --> 14:26.866
...and asked to speak
with our own Ainsley Whitly.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.738
Been following
the Carousel Killer story?

14:31.827 --> 14:34.786
Yeah.
So's everyone in New York.

14:34.830 --> 14:38.225
-JT: Your brother around?
-ARI: Noah's out with a cold.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.402
Detectives.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.188
GIL:
Must feel pretty good, right?

14:45.232 --> 14:46.537
Someone messing
with the Whitlys?

14:46.581 --> 14:48.278
I got nothing to do
with any of this.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.889
We just want to ask you
some questions.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.803
Last time you people asked me
some questions,

14:51.847 --> 14:53.457
you stole three years
of my life.

14:53.501 --> 14:54.894
I ain't going through
that again.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.896
Then give us better answers.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.898
GIL:
We know the killer has a grudge
against the Whitly family.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.203
And we know he had access

15:00.247 --> 15:03.032
to high-end
electronic equipment.

15:03.076 --> 15:04.555
You can see why that makes
the two of you

15:04.599 --> 15:05.730
pretty good suspects.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.384
I didn't do anything.

15:07.428 --> 15:10.083
You said "I."
You didn't say "we."

15:15.784 --> 15:18.569
I've been doing this
a long time, Ari.

15:18.613 --> 15:21.398
I can tell
you're holding something back.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.792
And I can also see
that you're afraid.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.837
[sighs]

15:29.450 --> 15:31.974
Guy came in.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.236
Maybe two, three weeks ago.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.065
White guy, 40s.
He knew who we were.

15:36.109 --> 15:40.243
Said he had a plan
to get back at the Whitlys.

15:40.287 --> 15:42.332
-Asked for our help.
-What'd you tell him?

15:42.376 --> 15:44.769
I told him to piss off.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.423
Trying to keep the past
in the past.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.860
-But your brother
was interested.
-He didn't say.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.862
But he's been acting
a little strange.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.255
Calling in sick.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.083
Hmm. That's why
you were glued to the TV.

15:54.127 --> 15:56.433
-You're worried about him.
-Eh, it's just...

15:56.477 --> 15:59.088
he can't let it go.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.090
We need to find
your brother ASAP.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.613
Can you help us do that?

16:02.657 --> 16:05.181
You have a chance to stop him

16:05.225 --> 16:07.357
from losing more
than three years.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.493
I can track his phone.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.977
[sighs]

16:19.717 --> 16:21.981
Bro?
Pacing?

16:22.024 --> 16:23.373
Not helping.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.986
We're cutting in again.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.639
-The killer's on the line?
-Well...

16:28.683 --> 16:30.337
akiller's on the line.

16:32.513 --> 16:33.993
AINSLEY:
Welcome back.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.386
I'm getting word
that Dr. Martin Whitly,

16:36.430 --> 16:38.649
also known as The Surgeon,

16:38.693 --> 16:40.303
also known as my father,

16:40.347 --> 16:43.002
-is on the phone.
-Hello. Uh...

16:43.045 --> 16:45.395
-am I live?
-Hello, Dr. Whitly.

16:45.439 --> 16:49.834
Well, hello, Ainsley.
Uh, first-time, longtime.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.446
I'm very excited
to be here with you.

16:54.448 --> 16:58.147
-Hello, Dr. Whitly.
-MARTIN [chuckling]:
Hello, Ainsley.

16:58.191 --> 16:59.844
AINSLEY:
Look at that. It's really you.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.542
So you'll just put anything
on the air?

17:01.585 --> 17:03.152
If it bleeds, it leads?

17:03.196 --> 17:04.675
The Carousel Killer
threatened to kill someone.

17:04.719 --> 17:05.676
My hands were tied.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.331
And it doesn't hurt our ratings.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.681
Oh, that-that's the photo
you're going with?

17:10.725 --> 17:12.857
Well...
[clears throat]

17:12.901 --> 17:16.948
It's not my best angle,
but, uh... c'est la vie.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.342
LESLIE:
Okay, Ainsley, see if you can
steer him into a soundbite.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.344
Can I get one of those?

17:21.388 --> 17:23.694
AINSLEY:
Dr. Whitly, why are you
calling in, exactly?

17:23.738 --> 17:25.348
MARTIN:
Because I want to help!

17:25.392 --> 17:27.959
You know, just in case
there are any NYPD consultants

17:28.003 --> 17:31.093
out there that could benefit
from my, uh, my insights.

17:31.137 --> 17:34.531
Well, Doctor, since
this is apparently

17:34.575 --> 17:36.359
a call-in show now, sure.

17:36.403 --> 17:39.536
-Let's hear your insights.
-Uh, well,

17:39.580 --> 17:42.452
profit-motivated killers
have always mystified me.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.367
You know, taking a human life
for something

17:44.411 --> 17:47.196
as tawdry as money, uh...

17:47.240 --> 17:50.721
but I guess that's easy to say
when your wife's loaded.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.376
-Ex-wife.
-Then again, uh,

17:53.420 --> 17:54.943
I don't think our killer

17:54.986 --> 17:57.554
is motivated one whit
by the money.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.904
In fact, it's clear
his motivation

17:59.948 --> 18:02.733
is all about, uh...

18:02.777 --> 18:04.387
[chuckling]

18:04.431 --> 18:05.736
...me.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.565
He's a psychopath
and a narcissist.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.654
Everything is always about him.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.917
AINSLEY:
Well, youare
a diagnosed psychopath

18:12.961 --> 18:14.005
and narcissist.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.572
Isn't everything

18:15.616 --> 18:18.575
-always about you?
-Well, that may be.

18:18.619 --> 18:23.102
Uh, but even a broken psyche
is right twice a day.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.495
And I'd bet my life that, uh,

18:25.539 --> 18:28.107
this Carousel Killer

18:28.150 --> 18:32.676
is connected to one
of my alleged victims.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.982
You don't need to say "alleged"

18:34.025 --> 18:35.636
when you're already
serving time.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.986
Yeah, but it has
such a beautiful ring to it,

18:38.029 --> 18:41.424
-don't you think?
-BRIGHT: Ainsley. When you get a chance, ask him,

18:41.468 --> 18:43.948
why does he think the money
doesn't matter?

18:43.992 --> 18:45.950
I have a question
from one of our producers.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.649
Why do you think the money
doesn't matter?

18:48.692 --> 18:50.868
MARTIN:
A producer, really?

18:50.912 --> 18:52.870
Astute question.

18:52.914 --> 18:56.439
Uh, well, uh,
it's the ostentation of it all.

18:56.483 --> 18:59.616
You know, the, the dead body
on the carousel,

18:59.660 --> 19:01.444
calling into your program--
there's a,

19:01.488 --> 19:04.273
there's a performative quality
about it that makes me think--

19:04.317 --> 19:05.970
and, you know, this is
just one man's opinion--

19:06.014 --> 19:09.148
that, uh, this is all
a distraction.

19:09.191 --> 19:12.629
You know, this killer
really wants something else.

19:12.673 --> 19:14.457
-Ask him... -AINSLEY: And what do you think

19:14.501 --> 19:15.545
the killer really wants?

19:18.331 --> 19:21.160
Oh... damn.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.987
Looks like I'm out
of phone time.

19:23.031 --> 19:26.469
But, you know, feel free
to book me on a segment

19:26.513 --> 19:27.470
anytime.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.168
Bye, sweetheart!

19:29.211 --> 19:31.170
AINSLEY: Once again,
that was The Surgeon,

19:31.213 --> 19:32.649
Dr. Martin Whitly,

19:32.693 --> 19:34.825
notorious serial killer.

19:34.869 --> 19:38.307

And... clear.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.483
And embarrassing father.

Great job, Ainsley.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.356
[phone ringing]

19:44.357 --> 19:47.316
Yes?

19:47.360 --> 19:49.579
Is it the killer?

19:49.623 --> 19:51.320
This is it.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.192
He wants to go on now.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.022
Okay, we're back
in five, people.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.677
[theme music plays]

20:00.721 --> 20:04.028
I'm Ainsley Whitly for ADN,

20:04.072 --> 20:06.857
and I'm getting word
that the Carousel Killer

20:06.901 --> 20:08.250
is back on the line.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.860
Sir, are you there?

20:09.904 --> 20:11.775
CAROUSEL KILLER:
Are you enjoying this?

20:11.819 --> 20:13.212
I was hoping
for a light first day.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.344
Then you called.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.259
CAROUSEL KILLER:
Well, I'm sure your ratings
are soaring.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.870
Just like a Whitly to profit
off the misfortune of others.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.611
AINSLEY:
Jessica Whitly has done

20:21.655 --> 20:23.526
so much for this city,
and she doesn't deserve this.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.049
-No one does.
-But they do.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.616
Admit it.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.228
You people don't care
if some random stranger

20:29.271 --> 20:31.230
-gets killed.
-Of course I care.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.535
And I don't think
that you're in a place

20:32.579 --> 20:34.233
to be making moral judgments.

20:34.276 --> 20:36.539
You literally have the word
"killer" in your name.

20:36.583 --> 20:37.540
BRIGHT:
Ains, listen.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.368
He keeps saying "random,"

20:39.412 --> 20:41.805
but he burned the fingerprints
off the victim in the park.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.894
He doesn't want us to know
who he was.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.548
AINSLEY:
You know whatI think?

20:45.592 --> 20:48.551
I think that maybe this victim
wasn't random at all.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.945
CAROUSEL KILLER:
Enough small talk.
Here are my instructions

20:50.988 --> 20:52.642
-for Jessica Whitly.
-Hold on!

20:52.686 --> 20:54.296
This is my show,
and I ask the questions.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.602
Who is that man you killed?

20:55.645 --> 20:57.560
Tell me, or I will
cut to commercial

20:57.604 --> 20:59.780
and you won't get
your million dollars.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.394
CAROUSEL KILLER:
He was an accessory.

21:05.438 --> 21:08.571
In 30 minutes, your mother
will bring the money

21:08.615 --> 21:11.922
-to the place where
she first met your father.
-[line clicks]

21:11.966 --> 21:16.100
AINSLEY:
Uh, I'm sorry,
we have been disconnected.

21:16.144 --> 21:18.581
As you know, this is
a developing situation,

21:18.625 --> 21:21.323
and ADN will continue
to provide

21:21.367 --> 21:24.108
updates as they come in.
Again...

21:24.152 --> 21:25.284
[phone buzzing]

21:25.327 --> 21:27.198
[sighs]

21:28.852 --> 21:31.638
-Hello, dear. Any updates?
-BRIGHT: Possibly.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.944
I need you to tell me the spot
where you first met Dad.

21:33.988 --> 21:37.818
Oh... who can remember?

21:37.861 --> 21:40.168
That's ancient history.

21:41.648 --> 21:42.997
You're planning
to pay the ransom.

21:43.040 --> 21:46.130
Don't do this.
It's too dangerous.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.002
-Tell me the meeting spot.
-Malcolm,

21:48.045 --> 21:50.613
he's left me no choice.

21:50.657 --> 21:52.223
I need to put an end to this

21:52.267 --> 21:54.487
before any more blood
is shed in our name.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.012
[sighs]

22:01.668 --> 22:04.148
And we'll be back with
more coverage after the break.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.889
And clear.

22:05.933 --> 22:08.327
-Where did Mom and Dad meet?
-How am I supposed to know?

22:08.370 --> 22:10.198
It's not exactly a story
she was fond of telling.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.982
You think the killer knew her?

22:12.026 --> 22:13.984
No.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.464
But she was a socialite.

22:15.508 --> 22:17.205
They must've done a write-up
on the wedding

22:17.248 --> 22:19.381
in the Times.Those usually
include how they met.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.688
-I'll get my researchers on it.
-DANI: Uh, no need. We got

22:21.731 --> 22:23.733
a lock on the killer's phone.
Those extra seconds did it.

22:39.749 --> 22:41.534
[phone buzzing and ringing]

22:52.936 --> 22:54.590
Hello?

22:54.634 --> 22:57.593
CAROUSEL KILLER:
Walk to the northwest corner.

23:07.908 --> 23:10.040
We're closing in on Noah Lehrer.
What do you got?

23:10.084 --> 23:12.391
We tracked the call.
The killer's in Stuyvesant Park.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.784
That's funny, so are we.

23:14.828 --> 23:16.220
He's here.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.135
I'll take the east side.

23:27.580 --> 23:31.540
CAROUSEL KILLER:
Good. Now look up.

23:31.584 --> 23:34.413
The corner building.

23:34.456 --> 23:38.068
-Do you see us?
-Yes, I see you.

23:38.112 --> 23:42.769
Do exactly as I say,
or I shove him over the edge.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.078
CAROUSEL KILLER:
Did you bring the money?

23:48.122 --> 23:50.080
-Of course I did.
-Good.

23:50.124 --> 23:51.125
I want you to dump it out.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.127
You can't be serious.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.477
Dump the money,
or I dump the man.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.784
-What?
-Now!

23:57.827 --> 23:59.612
Do you understand me?

24:12.799 --> 24:14.757
Yo, yo,

24:14.801 --> 24:16.455
that-that crazy lady's
throwing hundreds.

24:16.498 --> 24:20.154
[overlapping shouting]

24:27.422 --> 24:30.643
Are you happy?
I did exactly what you said.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.167
GIL:
Jessica!

24:34.995 --> 24:36.300
-Jessica!
-[gasps]

24:36.344 --> 24:38.302
-[shrieks]
-Are you okay?

24:38.346 --> 24:40.304
-[bystanders screaming]
-[gasps]

24:40.348 --> 24:43.046
He did it anyway!

24:49.836 --> 24:52.316
That's Noah Lehrer.
Ari's brother.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.363
The killer was just on that
roof, he can't have gone far.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.976
GIL:
All right. You can't stay here.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.369
Okay? We got to go.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.982
He did it anyway.

25:06.026 --> 25:08.419
Come on. Come on.

25:14.556 --> 25:17.167
We searched everywhere,
but there's no sign of him.

25:17.211 --> 25:21.345
Why? Why would anyone do that?

25:21.389 --> 25:24.218
You'd think I'd understand after
all these years, but I don't.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.350
That's a good thing.
You're not supposed to.

25:26.394 --> 25:27.700
Adolpho's here.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.005
I'll have uniformed officers
waiting at home.

25:29.049 --> 25:30.833
Wait, that's it?

25:30.877 --> 25:34.184
You're not gonna scream at me
for not listening to you both?

25:34.228 --> 25:36.665
It's not your fault. It's mine.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.580
This guy's been toying
with us all day.

25:38.624 --> 25:41.714
Go easy on yourself,
both of you.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.673
If I flew off the handle every
time a Whitly went rogue on me,

25:44.717 --> 25:45.892
I'd never get anything done.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.937
[sighs]

25:54.074 --> 25:55.249
BRIGHT:
Mom.

25:56.816 --> 25:59.949
From now on,
let the police deal with this.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.298
Can you do that?

26:01.342 --> 26:03.431
Just stop him.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.047
Million dollars.

26:11.091 --> 26:12.701
[exhales] Gone.

26:12.745 --> 26:16.052
Could've fixed
my Le Mans with that.

26:16.096 --> 26:19.055
This is psychological warfare.

26:19.099 --> 26:21.405
The killer wanted
to humiliate my mother

26:21.449 --> 26:23.712
by flaunting his disregard
for her wealth.

26:23.756 --> 26:27.324
He wanted my sister to look
like some craven muckraker.

26:27.368 --> 26:30.153
According to Ari,
he's a white male, 40s.

26:30.197 --> 26:32.895
I've already spoken to almost
all of the family members

26:32.939 --> 26:35.594
of your father's victims--
so far that's a dead end.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.813
Still no ID on the body
on the carousel?

26:37.857 --> 26:39.902
DNA didn't match anyone
in the system.

26:39.946 --> 26:42.601
The killer said
he was an "accessory."

26:42.644 --> 26:45.299
To him or my father?

26:48.998 --> 26:52.349
-Where are you going?
-To ask him myself.

27:01.315 --> 27:04.448
[sighs]

27:04.492 --> 27:06.494
[phone buzzing]

27:12.021 --> 27:14.458
Adolpho, you found my purse?

27:14.502 --> 27:16.678
What purse, ma'am?

27:16.722 --> 27:18.680
[phone continues buzzing]

27:26.993 --> 27:28.647
CAROUSEL KILLER:
Don't hang up.

27:28.690 --> 27:32.651
Don't warn the driver.
If you do, she will die.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.219
Who?

27:36.263 --> 27:38.744
There's a picture
in your purse.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.580
Why are you doing this?

27:49.624 --> 27:52.801
Because you understand the pain your husband inflicted,

27:52.845 --> 27:54.673
and now you can help stop it.

27:54.716 --> 27:58.589
-How do you propose I do that?
-You passed my last test.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.809
Means I can trust you.

28:00.853 --> 28:03.507
In your purse,
there's a ceramic weapon.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.684
The metal detectors
won't catch it.

28:13.648 --> 28:16.695
What are you asking me to do?

28:16.738 --> 28:18.740
Once you're alone in the cell,

28:18.784 --> 28:21.351
stab Martin Whitly
in the heart.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.527
I have eyes everywhere.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.442
I'll know if it's done.

28:25.486 --> 28:29.011
If he's not dead within 30
minutes, the hostage will die.

28:29.055 --> 28:31.535
If you warn the authorities,
the hostage will die.

28:31.579 --> 28:34.016
Is that clear?

28:34.060 --> 28:36.018
I can't do this.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.933
Yes, you can.

28:37.977 --> 28:41.110
That's why I chose you.

28:41.154 --> 28:45.114
This is an opportunity to do
what you've always wanted to,

28:45.158 --> 28:47.551
to kill The Surgeon.

28:47.595 --> 28:48.727
[line clicks]

28:57.910 --> 28:59.476
[lock buzzes]

29:05.482 --> 29:07.093
My boy.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.575
Oh, it's so good to see you.

29:11.619 --> 29:14.100
How was vacay?
Tell me everything.

29:14.143 --> 29:16.755
Did you know this man?

29:16.798 --> 29:20.584
You want to talk
about work. Okay.

29:20.628 --> 29:22.630
Uh... I don't think so.

29:22.673 --> 29:25.502
I mean, it's hard to tell with
the postmortem bloating. Why?

29:25.546 --> 29:27.635
I think he's somehow connected
to one of your victims.

29:27.678 --> 29:30.769
Well... you know more
about my victims than anyone.

29:30.812 --> 29:31.770
Start there.

29:32.858 --> 29:35.774
You've already done that.

29:35.817 --> 29:37.819
None of their families
match our killer,

29:37.863 --> 29:42.128
at least not one of the 23
that everybody knows about.

29:43.346 --> 29:46.262
But what about the others?

29:46.306 --> 29:48.308
Now, who says there are others?

29:48.351 --> 29:51.485
People have always speculated,

29:51.528 --> 29:54.053
and I know there's
at least one more.

29:58.187 --> 29:59.667
Hey,

29:59.710 --> 30:02.148
did you see my appearance
on Ainsley's show?

30:02.191 --> 30:03.802
Not bad, right?

30:03.845 --> 30:08.023
I mean, I'm no Regis,
at least not yet.

30:08.067 --> 30:09.808
Are you sure
you've never seen him before?

30:11.853 --> 30:14.943
[sighs]

30:14.987 --> 30:18.468
Nope. I'm sorry.

30:18.512 --> 30:20.688
-[lock buzzes, latch clicks]
-Damn it. I got to go.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.211
Don't leave angry.
I want to help.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.822
Malcolm.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.825
Well,

30:26.868 --> 30:30.698
this truly is my lucky day.

30:32.265 --> 30:35.964
I need to talk to your father,

30:36.008 --> 30:37.705
alone.

30:40.186 --> 30:43.363
MARTIN:
Jessie, darling,
we were not expecting you.

30:43.406 --> 30:45.495
Not that I'm complaining.

30:45.539 --> 30:48.672
Oh, gosh, when was the last time

30:48.716 --> 30:50.849
the three of us
were together like this?

30:50.892 --> 30:54.548
Could it be at that
pumpkin patch in Ossining?

30:54.591 --> 30:55.418
It was your murder trial.

30:56.463 --> 30:59.031
Ah, yes. You're right.

30:59.074 --> 31:03.339
-[chuckles]
-Oh, good times.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.167
Why are you here, Mother?

31:05.211 --> 31:09.693
I have something urgent
to discuss with your father.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.695
I just need a minute
alone with him.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.262
Well, as much as it pains me
to say this,

31:13.306 --> 31:15.003
I don't think I'm allowed
a conjugal visit

31:15.047 --> 31:18.615
right now. I'm a little on thin
ice when it comes to privileges.

31:21.401 --> 31:24.752
I'm very familiar
with your stress reactions.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.929
What's going on?

31:27.973 --> 31:30.236
Nothing.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.412
Did the killer contact you?

31:34.588 --> 31:37.547
He's holding something
over your head. What is it?

31:37.591 --> 31:39.636
MARTIN:
Look at him go, dear.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.029
Profiler extraordinaire.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.465
Shut up.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.206
What happened?

31:44.250 --> 31:47.557
Malcolm, I am begging you: go.

31:47.601 --> 31:50.560
You're working up your nerve.

31:50.604 --> 31:53.737
There's something
he wants you to do.

31:53.781 --> 31:56.218
That's your purse from the park.
The one you lost.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.394
-Uh...
-What's in there?
-I'm quite certain, son,

31:58.438 --> 32:00.919
you're not supposed
to ask a lady that.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.574
You're here to kill him.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.185
Sorry, what's that now?

32:08.796 --> 32:10.798
[exhales]

32:14.454 --> 32:15.803
JESSICA [whispers]:
He says your father

32:15.846 --> 32:17.413
has to die.

32:17.457 --> 32:20.764
BRIGHT:
You're not working
with a clear head.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.331
The killer's gotten
under your skin.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.420
You're not going to do this.

32:24.464 --> 32:25.944
JESSICA:
Why?

32:25.987 --> 32:27.423
How do you know that I won't?

32:27.467 --> 32:29.948
Because you're a good person.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.951
And going through with this
makes you like him.

32:32.994 --> 32:35.779
And you are nothing like him.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.781
MARTIN:
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure
of that, Malcolm.

32:37.825 --> 32:40.393
I can see a look in her eyes.

32:52.013 --> 32:54.015
-Ainsley.
-[knocks]

32:54.059 --> 32:55.234
You okay?

32:57.845 --> 32:59.978
What happens next time
somebody's taken?

33:00.021 --> 33:02.023
Are we gonna give every killer
this platform?

33:02.067 --> 33:04.286
All they have to do is call in
and we put them on TV?

33:04.330 --> 33:05.896
You know we did
a six share today?

33:05.940 --> 33:06.985
People died.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.684
You reported the news.
That's the job.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.686
-[scoffs]
-And you're great at it.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.649
What's the matter?

33:19.693 --> 33:21.651
My family.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.697
They're not answering.

33:28.354 --> 33:29.833
We should call Gil.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.661
No. The killer will know
if I call the police.

33:31.705 --> 33:33.489
And he will know if I don't
go through with it.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.056
How was he planning to verify?
Did he give you

33:35.100 --> 33:36.840
-any sort of camera?
-No, he just said

33:36.884 --> 33:38.842
that I have 30 minutes
to go through with it,

33:38.886 --> 33:40.714
and if I don't,
an innocent woman will die.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.759
Here. See for yourself.

33:45.066 --> 33:46.502
Who is she?

33:46.546 --> 33:49.679
-He didn't say.
-MARTIN: That's Cathy Paul.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.855
I used to do
the occasional surgery

33:51.899 --> 33:53.074
at Tarrytown Medical Center.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.555
Cathy was a, an OR nurse there.

33:55.598 --> 33:57.948
Actually, d-do you have
that other photo?

34:00.603 --> 34:02.040
Ah.

34:02.083 --> 34:04.346
Well, now I see it.
That's Dr. Jack Weaver.

34:04.390 --> 34:06.174
He assisted me
with the procedures.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.176
Man had terrible breath.

34:08.220 --> 34:09.612
Oh, I shouldn't speak ill
of the dead.

34:09.656 --> 34:12.093
Did anybody ever die
on your table there?

34:12.137 --> 34:14.052
Only one. Uh, Amelia Wheaton.

34:14.095 --> 34:16.576
Congenital heart defect.
She never had a chance.

34:16.619 --> 34:17.881
Did you purposely kill her?

34:17.925 --> 34:20.101
I never hurt a patient
on purpose.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.625
I followed the Hippocratic Oath
to the letter.

34:22.669 --> 34:26.107
Albeit with one small asterisk.

34:26.151 --> 34:28.762
We've been looking for someone
connected to your victims,

34:28.805 --> 34:31.547
but this killer is connected
to one of your patients.

34:31.591 --> 34:33.071
And he blames Cathy, too.

34:33.114 --> 34:35.899
In-in his eyes,
she's an accessory to murder.

34:35.943 --> 34:37.727
Malcolm, what are we
going to do?

34:37.771 --> 34:40.295
-I just need a minute to think.
-We don't have a minute.

34:40.339 --> 34:42.558
A good woman dies
so that a bad man can live?

34:42.602 --> 34:45.648
You know, I consulted
on three operations this week.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.302
Three. Saved lives.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.912
I mean,
maybe I'm the good person.

34:48.956 --> 34:51.567
BRIGHT:
You're not...

34:51.611 --> 34:53.613
a good person.

34:57.704 --> 35:00.141
He tried to kill me
when I was ten years old.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.578
[groans, chuckles]

35:02.622 --> 35:04.102
BRIGHT:
I found the girl.

35:04.145 --> 35:07.409
I'd learned what he was.

35:07.453 --> 35:08.976
-And he wanted to silence me.
-This is John Watkins

35:09.019 --> 35:10.499
told him this.

35:10.543 --> 35:12.936
He's taking the word
of a serial killer over...

35:12.980 --> 35:14.416
JESSICA:
Over who?

35:14.460 --> 35:17.158
A serial killer? You bastard.

35:27.168 --> 35:28.474
Yes, it's true.

35:30.911 --> 35:33.566
I took you up to the cabin
to kill you.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.788
The chloroform had lost its
efficacy, so I thought I'd...

35:38.832 --> 35:40.486
nip it in the bud.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.010
But...

35:44.838 --> 35:49.147
...I couldn't bring myself
to go through with it.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.800
That was my choice.

35:50.844 --> 35:54.282
And God knows I've been
paying for it ever since.

35:54.326 --> 35:55.849
You made sure of that.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.287
JESSICA:
I never imagined

35:59.331 --> 36:02.856
my opinion of you
could drop any lower.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.555
We're out of time.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.559
MARTIN:
Well, the solution is clear.

36:12.213 --> 36:17.479
If this man told you
to kill me, then kill me.

36:17.523 --> 36:19.307
What?

36:19.351 --> 36:22.005
You heard.

36:22.049 --> 36:24.312
I'm the villain here.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.314
The monster.

36:26.358 --> 36:29.317
So vanquish me.

36:29.361 --> 36:34.017
I hereby put myself
on the chopping block.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.845
Don't be such a martyr.

36:35.889 --> 36:37.630
Come on, boy!

36:41.155 --> 36:43.940
Remember Old Jeb Waller.

36:43.984 --> 36:46.943
-What would he do?
-Who?

36:54.908 --> 36:56.823
Are you sure?

37:03.264 --> 37:05.962
MARTIN:
Well, look at that.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.226
Steady as a statue.

37:08.269 --> 37:10.532
JESSICA:
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

37:10.576 --> 37:13.579
Malcolm. Malcolm,
you do not have to do this.

37:15.494 --> 37:18.453
He's right.

37:18.497 --> 37:19.802
It's the only way.

37:19.846 --> 37:22.152
My boy.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.765
[screams]

37:29.464 --> 37:31.292
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

37:43.348 --> 37:45.306
[monitor beeping steadily]

37:54.794 --> 37:56.839
[laughter]

37:56.883 --> 37:58.841
MARTIN:
My boy.

37:58.885 --> 37:59.973
[screams]

38:13.639 --> 38:15.641
â™ª

38:30.830 --> 38:33.006
BRIGHT:
Stop.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.883
Cory Wheaton,
you're under arrest.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.103
-[grunts]
-[handcuffs click]

38:44.191 --> 38:45.497
[laughs]

38:45.540 --> 38:47.325
Where's the hostage?

38:47.368 --> 38:49.196
-CORY: How did you find me?
-I was wondering how you'd know

38:49.239 --> 38:50.806
Martin Whitly was dead.

38:50.850 --> 38:55.985
The cameras at Claremont
are ancient, impossible to hack.

38:56.029 --> 38:58.336
They haven't hired
new guards there in years.

38:58.379 --> 39:01.556
It's what they don't have:
an operating room.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.253
A morgue.

39:03.297 --> 39:05.908
This hospital handles both.

39:05.952 --> 39:08.737
So all you needed was some
stolen scrubs and a badge.

39:09.782 --> 39:10.870
[sniffles]

39:12.872 --> 39:17.659
Your wife Amelia...
had a heart condition.

39:17.703 --> 39:19.269
Martin Whitly tried to save her.

39:19.313 --> 39:20.314
He murdered her.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.578
For what it's worth,

39:23.622 --> 39:25.493
The Surgeon never killed
any of his patients.

39:25.537 --> 39:28.366
-That's a lie.
-There's just one thing
I can't figure out.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.672
Why now?

39:30.716 --> 39:34.023
I thought I'd moved on.

39:34.067 --> 39:37.244
But then there's this interview
and a news conference.

39:37.287 --> 39:40.421
Suddenly, it's the Whitlys
everywhere,

39:40.465 --> 39:45.295
reminding me of Amelia
and everything I lost.

39:45.339 --> 39:47.820
Why do they get to be happy?

39:48.908 --> 39:50.605
We don't.

39:52.346 --> 39:55.305
We never have.

39:55.349 --> 39:58.221
We feel the same pain as you do.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.659
The kind that never goes away.

40:03.009 --> 40:05.315
But we don't go
murdering people.

40:05.359 --> 40:06.752
You're the son.

40:07.753 --> 40:10.233
Malcolm.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.584
[laughing]

40:13.759 --> 40:15.717
It looks like your mother

40:15.761 --> 40:17.980
followed my instructions
perfectly.

40:18.024 --> 40:19.547
Where's Cathy?

40:19.591 --> 40:21.244
-All right. Bright, easy.
-Where's the nurse?

40:21.288 --> 40:23.246
I always knew your mother
had it in her.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.423
Where is Cathy?

40:25.466 --> 40:28.991
Why should I tell you?
She helped that monster.

40:29.035 --> 40:31.254
You're the monster!
How do you explain Noah?

40:31.298 --> 40:33.561
He had nothing to do
with your wife's death.

40:33.605 --> 40:37.739
You'll tell yourself anything to
help justify what you've done.

40:37.783 --> 40:39.915
Cathy Paul?

40:39.959 --> 40:44.180
She's not a murderer,
she's not an accessory.

40:44.224 --> 40:46.879
She's just an innocent person.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.840
Where does it stop?

40:54.974 --> 40:58.456
42 Briggs. Apartment 12.

40:58.499 --> 40:59.805
16 Squad Central.

40:59.848 --> 41:02.677
Need a hostage recover,
42 Briggs, Apartment 12.

41:02.721 --> 41:05.506
I did you a favor
tonight, Malcolm.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.377
You're free of him.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.423
Your father's dead.

41:16.517 --> 41:20.303
Do you remember Jebediah Waller?

41:20.347 --> 41:21.957
MARTIN:
Why do I know that name?

41:22.001 --> 41:24.307
The St. Paul's Stabber.

41:24.351 --> 41:26.788
He tried improvisation.

41:26.832 --> 41:30.139
He stabbed a No. 2 pencil into
the heart of a local sheriff.

41:30.183 --> 41:33.969
I know this story. Uh, he
pierced the cop's myocardium

41:34.013 --> 41:36.145
a centimeter beneath
the seventh intercostal.

41:36.189 --> 41:37.495
And the cop lived.

41:37.538 --> 41:39.801
I still can't believe
he was okay.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.542
You know, there is a,
there is a point

41:41.586 --> 41:43.152
where you can pierce the heart,

41:43.196 --> 41:45.807
uh, and not disrupt
a single coronary artery.

41:45.851 --> 41:48.810
So, in effect, you know,
you can be stabbed right here

41:48.854 --> 41:51.770
and somehow emerge
perfectly fine.

41:53.467 --> 41:56.949
â™ª Would it be without you?â™ª

41:58.951 --> 42:01.519
I need you to come down
to the hospital, Ains.

42:01.562 --> 42:02.694
It's Dad.

42:04.739 --> 42:07.437
See you soon. Bye.

42:09.483 --> 42:13.835
â™ª She feels she needs
to leave...â™ª

42:13.879 --> 42:17.273
Kid, what happened at Claremont?

42:17.317 --> 42:21.060
Jessica stabbed him?
You were there?

42:23.584 --> 42:25.020
[screams]

42:25.064 --> 42:27.545
Where is she?

42:27.588 --> 42:29.198
Is she all right?

42:29.242 --> 42:32.245
JT and Dani are talking to her
down at the precinct.

42:34.421 --> 42:38.077
And I'm talking to you now.

42:40.079 --> 42:41.689
What happened?

42:41.733 --> 42:46.085
â™ª While the others
start to disagree...â™ª

42:48.348 --> 42:50.306
It was the only way.

42:50.350 --> 42:53.048
â™ª Rough and moving grounds...â™ª

42:53.092 --> 42:54.789
MARTIN:
But, naturally,

42:54.833 --> 42:56.965
the margin for error is nil.

42:57.009 --> 43:00.882
I mean, if you miss the target,
the heart will fail,

43:00.926 --> 43:04.103
and no surgeon, not even me,
can save you then.

43:05.626 --> 43:09.499
It's like, uh,
threading the eye of a needle.

43:09.543 --> 43:11.023
â™ª Would it be without you?â™ª

43:46.145 --> 43:47.712
MAN:
Greg, move your head.
