WEBVTT

01:21.373 --> 01:26.994
DOUBLE LOVER

01:48.609 --> 01:49.724
Am I hurting you?

01:50.736 --> 01:51.736
Are you sure?

01:52.904 --> 01:53.904
Yes.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.031
Just a little infection.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.245
Nothing serious.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.786
But be careful of your weight.

02:06.918 --> 02:10.036
If you lose more,
your periods will stop again.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.163
And my stomach pains?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.335
They're back?

02:14.760 --> 02:16.842
They're getting worse.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.257
I see nothing abnormal.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.097
I can prescribe an ultrasound
if you like.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.307
I think it's mainly psychological.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.593
In your head.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.560
Could you recommend someone?

02:31.443 --> 02:32.443
Yes.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.189
I think I'm ready.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.563
Would you prefer
a man or a woman?

02:44.081 --> 02:46.368
Paul Meyer Psychiatrist

03:30.377 --> 03:31.377
Ms. Fortin?

03:41.388 --> 03:42.469
Have a seat.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.400
I suppose I should start?

04:01.867 --> 04:03.198
If you like.

04:06.204 --> 04:09.117
I've always had stomach pains.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.200
I've tried a number of diets.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.456
I went gluten-free.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.250
I've seen specialists,
but they never find anything.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.590
People say it's psychological,

04:23.722 --> 04:25.929
the stomach being a second brain.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.474
So I might as well see a shrink.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.636
I understand.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.609
I'm 25.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.146
I live alone.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.609
Well, not completely.
I live with my cat, Milo.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.038
I'm currently looking for work.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.707
It's tough, I'm stressed.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.372
I say the wrong things,
blow everything.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.628
I made good money
when I was younger.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.467
As a model.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.094
But I quit.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.431
I've had a few lovers.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.184
Nothing major.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.520
I think I'm incapable of loving.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.066
I feel empty sometimes.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.644
Like something's missing.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.985
Sometimes I cry for no reason.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.037
There you are.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.961
Think you can help me?

05:41.925 --> 05:45.293
I think the pain you feel
reveals something about you.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.763
Together,
we'll try to find out what it is.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.693
I dreamt about you already.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.702
Is that a good sign?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.247
I'm listening.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.667
I was pregnant.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.749
By who, I don't know.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.543
But it hurt, real bad.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.669
My stomach kept expanding.
I was afraid it'd explode.

06:28.763 --> 06:32.802
I was here,
lying on a gynecological table.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.468
You had steel instruments

06:37.647 --> 06:40.014
resembling torture instruments.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.811
I asked you not to hurt me
but you didn't respond.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.114
You spread my legs

06:50.243 --> 06:52.234
and looked at my sex.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.995
I tried to close my legs.
I felt you were going to rape me.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.871
Ridiculous, no?

07:06.134 --> 07:08.671
When I started modeling, it was...

07:09.930 --> 07:11.136
exciting.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.097
Then it got sleazy.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.509
I wanted to be an actress as a kid.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.927
I wanted...

07:19.356 --> 07:20.437
to charm.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.098
Seduce those around me.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.352
Especially the adults.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.312
My mother's friends.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.776
I liked feeling them looking at me.

07:34.245 --> 07:36.407
But I didn't like them touching me.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.369
I was shy.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.829
Awkward.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.464
I often imagined I had a sister.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.844
A twin.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.215
A double, who would protect me.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.264
When I was 7,
my mother told me I was an accident.

08:04.526 --> 08:07.188
From a one-night stand
she'd forgotten.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.357
She wouldn't recognize his face.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.818
Maybe he was violent with her.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.287
Or maybe he paid for her.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.073
Like a whore.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.875
I was raised by my grandparents.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.543
My mother didn't have time.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.380
She was a beautiful woman.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.547
Free,

08:34.389 --> 08:35.845
intelligent.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.765
But there was no tenderness
between us.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.312
When I imagine her death,
her funeral...

08:46.109 --> 08:47.850
I feel nothing.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.695
In her coffin, I see myself.

08:51.823 --> 08:52.823
Dead.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.242
I don't see her anymore.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.987
But I feel she's watching me.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.198
Knows my thoughts.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.620
In my dreams
she looks at me harshly.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.256
She judges me.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.387
I feel she doesn't love me.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.933
And it hurts.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.690
Hurts where?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.600
In my stomach.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.357
For once you speak.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.617
When you look at me that way...

09:49.380 --> 09:51.166
I feel I exist.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.099
Hello.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.669
They called me today.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.713
I got the job.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.044
Part-time in a museum, decent pay.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.671
Watchwoman.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.267
It's funny.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.644
Funny?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.059
Watching people is strange.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.480
Then again, it's a museum.
Not a prison.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.233
It's thanks to you.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.652
You gave me confidence.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.321
My stomach hasn't hurt in a week.

11:45.997 --> 11:47.863
I'm afraid I'll get better.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.126
Why?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.793
I think I want to stay weak.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.668
Keep hurting, while you...

11:59.219 --> 12:01.130
stay strong.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.840
Nothing to say today?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.046
I feel good.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.511
I think I'm happy.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.768
Right.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.182
Then we should end our sessions.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.436
Why?
Did I do something wrong?

12:57.735 --> 12:58.735
No.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.479
It´s me.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.358
This has never happened before.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.161
I have feelings
that make it impossible to continue.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.041
Feelings?

13:16.170 --> 13:17.170
Yes.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.507
I'll recommend a colleague.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.505
An excellent therapist.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.632
No need, thanks.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.431
We should take the time
to discuss it.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.146
No need.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.529
You don't think you've cured me?

13:51.706 --> 13:53.617
I think you were my remedy.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.950
Goodbye.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.474
Don't play with this.

14:21.611 --> 14:22.817
I'm not playing-

15:13.496 --> 15:14.496
Hello.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.365
Are you the one moving in
on the 13th floor?

15:18.501 --> 15:19.366
Yes.

15:19.502 --> 15:20.583
Hello, miss.

15:21.379 --> 15:24.167
We'll be neighbors,
I'm on the same floor.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.333
That's nice.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.503
I loved my last neighbors.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.218
They had to leave.
She was pregnant.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.011
You have a cat?

15:32.181 --> 15:33.181
Yes.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.016
What a sweetheart!

15:35.184 --> 15:36.424
He's so cute.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.102
- What's his name?
- Milo.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.516
Milo, you're a looker!

15:41.315 --> 15:42.805
How old are you?

15:43.192 --> 15:44.192
Seven.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.393
I've always loved cats.

15:46.529 --> 15:49.146
I had a darling one
who died <i>2</i> years ago.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.317
You should get a new one.

15:51.868 --> 15:52.868
No.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.493
Goodbye, miss.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.331
Goodbye.

17:25.545 --> 17:26.626
It's me.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.872
- Chloé, are you here?
- I'm here.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.465
Hello, my love.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.348
I see your cat's right at home.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.054
- Want a drink?
- Yes.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.391
- How was your day?
- I spent it at the hospital.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.654
It's so different
to see people in real pain,

17:54.782 --> 17:55.988
who need me.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.487
Makes a change from me.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.240
You're my very special case.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.337
You OK?

18:16.429 --> 18:17.429
Yes.

18:20.683 --> 18:21.798
Are you sure?

18:22.226 --> 18:24.513
It's strange,
you know everything about me.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.849
But I sometimes feel
I'm with a stranger.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.681
Like you're hiding things.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.652
Why do you say that?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.152
I found your old passport in a box.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.197
- You got into my stuff?
- I was just unpacking.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.164
I saw you had a different name.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.670
Delord, I believe.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.131
Don't want to talk about it?

19:01.766 --> 19:02.766
Sure.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.014
It's not important.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.842
That's why I didn't tell you.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.730
When I began my practice
I took my mother's name.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.351
Paul Meyer has a ring to it, no?

19:51.273 --> 19:52.934
We said not in the bedroom.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.182
Sorry.

19:54.485 --> 19:56.101
He has to get used to it.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.072
Come on, kitty.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.740
Paul?

20:05.371 --> 20:08.113
Promise to tell me everything
and hide nothing?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.287
Promise to stop getting into my stuff?

20:13.504 --> 20:14.960
I promise.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.723
Good morning.

20:26.851 --> 20:27.966
Sleep well?

20:28.644 --> 20:30.601
Not really.
I had a strange dream.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.518
The first night is always strange.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.310
Especially with a stranger.

20:35.693 --> 20:36.693
I gotta run.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.690
Big day at the hospital.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.562
Have a good day, honey.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.491
You too.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.526
- See you tonight.
- Yes.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.140
Hello.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.108
- You can go.
- Ok, thanks.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.691
What'd you do today?

22:46.407 --> 22:47.989
Worked non-stop.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.608
Where were you?

22:51.328 --> 22:52.534
At the hospital.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.954
I didn't even have time for lunch.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.084
Why are you lying?

23:00.838 --> 23:02.328
I'm not lying, Chloé.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.380
I saw you on my way home.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.124
Talking to a woman.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.501
Impossible.
The hospital's across town.

23:08.929 --> 23:09.929
But I saw you.

23:11.807 --> 23:12.922
You're mistaken.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.343
It wasn't me.
I must have a look-alike.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.520
I'm sure it was you!

23:20.274 --> 23:21.274
Chloé!

23:21.483 --> 23:22.483
Calm down.

23:25.279 --> 23:26.360
You're tired.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.939
You didn't sleep last night.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.411
Take it easy.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.430
Louis Delord Psychoanalyst

24:03.484 --> 24:04.484
Hello.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.234
I'm calling to make an appointment.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.107
My name is Eva.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.563
Eva Martin.

24:10.699 --> 24:15.193
You can reach me at
O6 34 22 19 16.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.449
Thank you, goodbye.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.042
Ms. Martin?

24:31.762 --> 24:32.762
Yes?

24:33.263 --> 24:36.096
This is Mr. Delord.
I got your message.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.432
You'd like an appointment.

24:40.521 --> 24:43.354
Very well.
I've got an opening in two weeks.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.064
Nothing sooner?

24:45.484 --> 24:46.599
Let me check.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.313
I've got a cancellation
tomorrow at 1 pm.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.444
Ok, tomorrow's perfect.

24:55.661 --> 24:56.661
See you tomorrow.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.156
See you tomorrow.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.013
Have you settled in well?

25:18.183 --> 25:19.264
Yes, thanks.

25:19.393 --> 25:20.393
Is he nappy?

25:20.769 --> 25:22.430
- Happy?
- Your cat.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.147
Milo, yes.
My boyfriend, not so much.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.561
He never liked cats.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.685
Men are heartless.
They don't understand animals.

25:31.071 --> 25:32.812
- Goodnight.
- Good evening.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.784
Milo?

25:48.422 --> 25:49.457
Where are you?

25:57.681 --> 25:59.922
My baby!
Who put you in there?

26:08.776 --> 26:10.062
Hi, it's me.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.852
- How are you?
- Fine, good.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.611
When'll you be home?

26:14.907 --> 26:18.400
I've got emergencies at the hospital.
I'll be late.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.071
Eat without me.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.786
It'll probably drag on.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.029
All right.

26:23.499 --> 26:24.580
Are you mad?

26:25.793 --> 26:26.874
No.

26:27.544 --> 26:28.409
Work well.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.331
Thanks. Kisses.

28:16.570 --> 28:17.570
MS. Martin!

28:35.047 --> 28:36.047
Come in.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.262
Have a seat.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.312
Does it happen often?

28:57.694 --> 28:58.694
What?

28:59.404 --> 29:00.986
Your little dizzy spell.

29:01.990 --> 29:02.990
No.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.615
Only in certain circumstances?

29:07.371 --> 29:09.453
You look like someone I know.

29:10.624 --> 29:11.624
Do I?

29:13.585 --> 29:15.246
Paul Meyer.

29:21.051 --> 29:22.291
He's my brother.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.053
Do you know him well?

29:28.517 --> 29:29.598
Not very.

29:30.852 --> 29:33.139
I consulted him, to no avail.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.307
Rest assured.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.726
We're twins
and went to the same schools,

29:36.858 --> 29:39.475
but our therapeutic methods
are very different.

29:40.112 --> 29:42.149
I don't suppose he sent you.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.281
No.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.273
A girlfriend did.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.408
I mean my sister.

29:48.996 --> 29:50.862
A girlfriend, your sister...

29:51.999 --> 29:54.457
- Do I know her?
- I don't think so.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.084
My name is Eva, I'm 25...

30:02.175 --> 30:04.507
and I live with a man I adore.

30:05.429 --> 30:08.842
He loves me, but sometimes
I feel very alone with him.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.473
I feel an emptiness.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.554
Do you make love with him?

30:16.106 --> 30:17.106
Yes.

30:18.108 --> 30:19.108
Of course.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.319
It all stems
from my mother's death.

30:24.448 --> 30:27.782
I feel her watching me, judging me.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.784
But I'm not convinced
you can help me.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.373
If you follow my therapy,

30:36.501 --> 30:37.741
which will cost you,

30:38.211 --> 30:39.918
I think I can cure you.

30:40.047 --> 30:41.833
If you stop lying to me.

30:43.050 --> 30:44.050
Lying to you?

30:44.426 --> 30:46.542
I don't believe you have a sister.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.464
You're an only child, right?

30:49.765 --> 30:52.974
Is your mother really dead,
or do you wish her dead?

30:53.518 --> 30:55.304
Lying to seduce

30:56.104 --> 30:58.436
is common practice
among pretty women.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.561
Especially the frigid ones.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.708
Yes.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.376
I'll call you back.

31:22.672 --> 31:23.878
Take care.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.540
Excuse me.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.417
I'm willing to see you again.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.510
I do refuse certain patients.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.464
Those who'd be bland
without their vices.

31:34.434 --> 31:35.434
Excuse me.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.392
This isn't going to work.

31:37.562 --> 31:40.020
Please pay me for the full session.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.434
150 euros.

31:42.025 --> 31:43.766
Don't mention me to my brother.

31:44.361 --> 31:45.361
I don't see him anymore.

31:45.654 --> 31:46.654
Good.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.818
Next time
we'll see if you're interesting...

31:50.492 --> 31:51.607
or a silly twat.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.529
There'll be no next time!

32:09.052 --> 32:10.052
How's the museum?

32:11.805 --> 32:12.840
Not great.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.099
Really?

32:15.642 --> 32:16.973
I guess it's fine.

32:17.561 --> 32:18.642
Are you bored'?

32:20.480 --> 32:21.891
Why do you say that?

32:22.023 --> 32:23.354
I don't know.

32:24.067 --> 32:26.775
I suppose sitting there for hours...

32:33.493 --> 32:36.201
Why won't you introduce me
to your family?

32:37.706 --> 32:39.162
You know my parents

32:39.291 --> 32:42.374
live in the USA.
You'll meet them when they're here.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.836
You haven't introduced me
to your mother.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.503
Honey...

32:53.096 --> 32:54.427
What's wrong?

32:54.556 --> 32:56.638
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.435
Maybe you need to go back to therapy.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.106
You think?

33:04.983 --> 33:08.101
If you're feeling low,
I can recommend someone.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.602
I feel fine.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.821
I remember the first time I saw you.

33:13.408 --> 33:17.151
You seemed a bit lost,
but stronger than most of my patients.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.371
Did you think
I was a silly twat?

33:21.500 --> 33:22.500
No.

33:23.293 --> 33:24.783
Just a dirty twat!

33:27.047 --> 33:29.084
Tell me what you really thought.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.796
"I hope I don't fall in love."

34:06.836 --> 34:07.836
Milo...

34:09.005 --> 34:10.210
my baby...

34:39.744 --> 34:41.576
Ever wish you had a brother?

34:41.705 --> 34:42.739
A brother?

34:44.833 --> 34:47.165
I suffered as an only child.

34:47.877 --> 34:49.538
It never bothered me.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.791
I had a happy childhood.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.335
What about a twin brother?

34:54.467 --> 34:55.922
No thanks.

34:56.052 --> 34:59.010
It'd be like looking in a mirror
all the time.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.005
Maybe you have one
and don't know.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.975
Why'd you change your name?

35:11.151 --> 35:12.733
Why not use Delord?

35:13.111 --> 35:14.476
I told you, Chloé.

35:14.904 --> 35:17.066
Taking my mother's name was easier.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.866
It's an old story.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.153
My father's company
had legal troubles.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.496
Conflicts of interest,
insider trading...

35:26.625 --> 35:29.037
It was in the headlines for months.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.502
He wasn't guilty,
but he was responsible.

35:33.048 --> 35:36.291
He was acquitted,
but his name was sullied.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.258
My parents moved far away.

35:40.472 --> 35:41.472
As for me,

35:41.598 --> 35:45.136
it was better to use
my mother's name professionally.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.267
My father even advised me to.

35:48.813 --> 35:49.813
That's all.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.396
Do you believe me?

35:52.067 --> 35:53.067
Yes.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.609
That cat!

36:01.660 --> 36:02.775
Shit.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.451
Hello.

36:04.579 --> 36:05.990
Hello.
Everything OK?

36:06.414 --> 36:07.154
Yes.

36:07.290 --> 36:10.157
I made a cake, I thought I'd share.

36:10.835 --> 36:11.835
How nice, thanks.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.376
Can I come in?

36:14.089 --> 36:15.089
Of course.

36:20.845 --> 36:22.802
Looks good.
You've fixed it up well.

36:23.264 --> 36:24.470
I like the colors.

36:24.599 --> 36:25.599
Thank you.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.688
Say. . -

36:31.481 --> 36:33.438
- Could you do me a favor?
- Sure.

36:34.484 --> 36:37.977
Paul doesn't like Milo.
Could you take him awhile?

36:38.863 --> 36:40.149
Of course.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.906
That's very kind.
Sure you don't mind?

36:43.034 --> 36:44.650
I'll take good care of him.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.784
I love cats!

36:51.042 --> 36:52.373
Some of Rose's cake?

37:21.698 --> 37:23.689
The Meaning of Dreams
by A. Wexler

37:31.332 --> 37:33.073
Agnès Wexler...

37:37.630 --> 37:38.916
Surprised I came back?

37:39.048 --> 37:41.460
To be honest,
I didn't give it a thought.

37:43.553 --> 37:44.964
Do you regret it?

37:45.597 --> 37:47.804
I didn't like your behavior.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.474
- But I think you can help me.
- Help you with what?

37:52.645 --> 37:53.726
Cure me.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.055
Cure you of what?

37:56.900 --> 37:58.106
My problems.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.143
Your problems... or problem?

38:01.988 --> 38:03.103
My problem.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.567
How would you define it?

38:06.701 --> 38:08.317
I don't really know.

38:08.453 --> 38:09.659
- Yes you do.
- No.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.370
That's why I'm here.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.788
So you can help me find out.

38:14.209 --> 38:15.791
I think you're lying again.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.501
- That's not why you're back.
- It is.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.084
Perfect.

38:21.216 --> 38:23.082
See you next week, same time.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.924
The session just began.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.589
I decide how long it lasts.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.758
We've covered it for today.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.065
Goodbye.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.607
Pardon me.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.688
150 euros.

38:59.128 --> 39:01.119
How'd it go with Agnès Wexler?

39:02.549 --> 39:03.549
Good.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.337
Don't want to talk about it?

39:07.011 --> 39:08.593
She didn't say much.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.929
She mainly listened.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.715
Like you, the first time.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.799
Tell her about your stomach?

39:15.311 --> 39:16.311
Yes.

39:16.896 --> 39:18.352
What's she think?

39:18.481 --> 39:19.767
That it's your fault.

39:19.899 --> 39:20.899
My fault?

39:21.234 --> 39:22.440
Just kidding.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.272
We didn't go into it.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.229
But you're happy?

39:27.574 --> 39:29.690
Yes, she thinks she can cure me.

39:29.826 --> 39:32.443
Cure you?
Are you sure she used that word?

39:32.912 --> 39:33.912
Yes.

39:34.497 --> 39:35.612
Surprising.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.499
Why?

39:38.293 --> 39:39.624
It's not her style.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.776
What's the matter?

42:06.190 --> 42:07.396
Come in.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.069
Follow me.

42:17.618 --> 42:18.618
Where?

42:40.725 --> 42:42.056
Get undressed.

42:42.727 --> 42:43.512
You're crazy.

42:43.686 --> 42:45.347
Time for applied techniques.

42:45.480 --> 42:46.641
- Come closer.
- No.

42:47.398 --> 42:48.398
Yes.

42:49.442 --> 42:50.773
You want to.

42:51.652 --> 42:52.687
I can%.

42:53.821 --> 42:56.734
"He who desires but acts not,
breeds pestilence."

42:56.866 --> 42:58.402
I don't desire you.

42:59.035 --> 43:00.617
Then why'd you come back?

43:01.412 --> 43:03.119
- To...
- Yes?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.365
Learn the truth.

43:10.421 --> 43:11.536
Then let yourself go.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.663
Next time you'll come.

47:11.287 --> 47:12.698
Leaving already?

47:13.706 --> 47:15.322
I have to go to work.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.161
Did you like our session?

47:20.921 --> 47:22.628
No one's ever done that to me.

47:22.757 --> 47:25.215
No one's ever fucked you like that?

47:25.718 --> 47:27.504
You've fantasized it.

47:27.636 --> 47:28.797
Same thing.

47:31.140 --> 47:33.097
- Beautiful cat. Is he yours?
- Yes.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.309
I have a cat too.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.847
My neighbor has him
because of my boyfriend.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.976
Is he allergic to cats?

47:44.570 --> 47:47.278
He just wants to be the only male.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.447
Is it a female?

47:50.826 --> 47:51.826
No.

47:52.995 --> 47:54.861
Danton is a male.

47:54.997 --> 47:57.034
Rare for a tortoiseshell.

47:57.166 --> 47:58.372
Tortoiseshell?

47:58.501 --> 47:59.707
Never heard of it'?

48:01.170 --> 48:03.753
They're usually female,
with two colors.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.748
In less than 1% of cases,
they're male

48:07.301 --> 48:09.292
with three colors.

48:10.513 --> 48:11.719
Always twins.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.472
- Twins?
- Yes.

48:15.684 --> 48:18.267
It's a genetic eccentricity.

48:18.813 --> 48:22.056
Caused by a trisomy
of the sex chromosome.

48:25.486 --> 48:27.272
Unique creatures.

48:27.696 --> 48:29.152
Monstrous.

48:30.533 --> 48:32.444
When the cat's ovum is fertilized,

48:32.576 --> 48:35.113
twin fetuses develop in the uterus.

48:35.496 --> 48:39.956
But after a few weeks
they meld into one organism.

48:40.626 --> 48:42.162
A unique cat,

48:42.294 --> 48:44.626
with the genetic properties of twins,

48:44.755 --> 48:46.462
XXY...

48:47.299 --> 48:48.334
In fact,

48:49.051 --> 48:50.633
it's the dominant twin.

48:53.514 --> 48:55.505
It happens in people, too.

48:56.517 --> 48:59.555
Some people discover, as adults,

48:59.728 --> 49:04.222
they're carrying inside them
the fetus of a brother or sister.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.646
They're cannibal twins.

49:40.102 --> 49:41.102
Hello.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.302
How's Milo doing?

49:43.439 --> 49:45.100
I was just coming to see you.

49:45.232 --> 49:46.267
What's wrong?

49:46.400 --> 49:48.937
I'm sorry,
I think I did something foolish.

49:49.320 --> 49:52.312
Don't worry,
you know how cats come and go.

49:53.908 --> 49:56.070
He took off that way.

50:03.918 --> 50:06.455
I'm leaving it open
so he can come back.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.636
This is my sweetheart, Luigi.

50:17.264 --> 50:18.971
He was my daughter's cat.

50:19.266 --> 50:21.348
- Your daughter?
- This was her room.

50:22.311 --> 50:23.426
Sorry, I didn't know.

50:23.812 --> 50:25.974
She's not dead, rest assured.

50:26.774 --> 50:27.774
Good.

50:27.900 --> 50:29.436
She's just a bit sick.

50:30.110 --> 50:33.523
She's been in an institution
since she turned twenty.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.151
She's a tormented young lady.

50:54.260 --> 50:55.341
Come.

51:02.309 --> 51:04.141
How did you and Paul meet?

51:04.812 --> 51:06.644
He prefers I don't talk about it.

51:06.772 --> 51:07.978
Why?

51:09.108 --> 51:11.645
It's a secret.
I'm an ex-patient.

51:13.529 --> 51:14.529
I see.

51:15.114 --> 51:16.400
Do you know Paul's brother?

51:17.074 --> 51:19.361
- Paul has a brother?
- A twin.

51:20.786 --> 51:22.447
You've never met him?

51:22.746 --> 51:23.746
No.

51:24.540 --> 51:26.326
They went to school together.

51:27.126 --> 51:28.491
I'd remember that.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.417
Excuse me.

51:37.511 --> 51:40.173
- Had any cases with twins?
- Meaning?

51:40.306 --> 51:43.469
A patient
who hides the existence of a twin?

51:43.642 --> 51:45.974
No, but I'm sure it happens.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.761
When twins are raised
to be the same,

51:48.897 --> 51:50.638
as adults they're eager

51:50.774 --> 51:53.357
to cut the other twin
from their lives.

51:53.485 --> 51:56.022
I remember some worried parents

51:56.155 --> 51:58.988
who thought their twins
were psychically linked.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.778
The twins had a secret language,

52:01.910 --> 52:05.653
and one of them
sucked his brother's thumb.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.365
Bizarre, no?

52:33.484 --> 52:34.484
Miss?

52:38.280 --> 52:39.280
Thank you.

52:47.289 --> 52:48.404
Where were you?

52:49.375 --> 52:50.661
Wandering around.

52:51.669 --> 52:53.956
- Who's that woman?
- Seriously?

52:54.088 --> 52:54.748
What?

52:55.089 --> 52:56.500
You don't recognize her?

52:56.632 --> 52:57.497
No.

52:57.633 --> 52:59.795
It's your shrink, Agnès Wexler.

53:03.097 --> 53:05.179
I've had too much to drink, sorry.

53:06.183 --> 53:07.183
Let's go home.

53:10.270 --> 53:11.270
Good night.

53:12.398 --> 53:13.763
- Careful.
- I'm fine.

53:13.899 --> 53:15.435
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.360
Chloé...

53:20.989 --> 53:22.445
Feeling better?

53:22.783 --> 53:24.319
My stomach pains are back.

53:24.868 --> 53:26.074
From seeing Wexler?

53:26.203 --> 53:26.863
No.

53:26.995 --> 53:28.577
Since you began seeing her...

53:28.706 --> 53:30.196
- Stop the car.
- What?

53:30.332 --> 53:31.447
Let me out!

53:31.583 --> 53:32.368
I can%.

53:32.501 --> 53:33.501
Stop!

53:33.627 --> 53:35.083
Careful!

54:08.412 --> 54:09.573
What's she doing?

54:22.301 --> 54:23.462
Unbelievable.

54:23.594 --> 54:24.594
Chloé!

54:33.812 --> 54:35.428
Think I'm hysterical?

54:36.148 --> 54:37.263
Cut the crap.

54:37.399 --> 54:38.399
Enough.

54:39.526 --> 54:40.526
Come on.

54:49.411 --> 54:51.152
Your boyfriend would be jealous.

54:51.747 --> 54:53.533
If he knew, I'd leave you.

54:55.918 --> 54:57.784
So you love me less?

55:04.843 --> 55:07.050
I know only sex with you.

55:10.933 --> 55:13.391
And him?
Think you know him?

55:14.686 --> 55:15.686
No.

55:16.146 --> 55:17.307
Not really.

55:22.277 --> 55:24.518
Which of us is more attractive?

55:25.447 --> 55:26.687
I don't know.

55:29.576 --> 55:30.941
You don't know...

55:31.495 --> 55:33.156
or don't want to tell me?

55:33.914 --> 55:36.326
When I'm with you,
I think of him.

55:37.501 --> 55:39.617
When I'm with him,
I think of you.

55:59.648 --> 56:01.309
What're you thinking about?

56:01.900 --> 56:02.900
You.

56:03.235 --> 56:04.350
Liar!

56:04.486 --> 56:05.486
I am.

56:18.292 --> 56:19.532
Not tonight.

56:21.295 --> 56:22.706
My stomach hurts.

56:23.088 --> 56:24.088
Again?

56:24.548 --> 56:25.754
I have my period.

56:46.862 --> 56:47.862
Let go.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.486
- Stop.
- Let me...

56:50.866 --> 56:51.866
No.

56:53.660 --> 56:55.651
- Let yourself go.
- I don't want to.

57:33.283 --> 57:35.445
Does my brother fuck you this way?

57:36.662 --> 57:37.662
What?

57:37.913 --> 57:40.029
I've had patients
with pseudonyms before!

57:40.666 --> 57:42.452
Miss Eva-Chloé!

57:45.504 --> 57:48.496
- How'd you know?
- I've known from the start.

57:49.049 --> 57:50.380
Why didn't you say anything?

57:50.509 --> 57:53.422
It was fun
watching you drown in your lies.

57:53.553 --> 57:56.966
I understand.
My brother can't cure you like I do.

57:58.767 --> 58:00.257
- I gotta go.
- Wait!

58:01.353 --> 58:02.468
- I'm in a hurry!
- Wait.

58:03.855 --> 58:05.266
We have to talk.

58:05.399 --> 58:07.015
We must stop this.

58:07.693 --> 58:09.275
Just don't tell him.

58:10.445 --> 58:12.607
You don't exist to him anyway.

58:17.577 --> 58:18.577
I know.

58:24.042 --> 58:26.409
He could never stand having a twin.

58:28.213 --> 58:29.669
He denies my existence.

58:30.257 --> 58:32.214
He wanted to be the only one.

58:33.510 --> 58:34.966
An only child.

58:36.513 --> 58:38.299
My parents' favorite.

58:41.476 --> 58:43.012
I no longer exist.

58:47.774 --> 58:49.356
I think I'll quit.

58:49.484 --> 58:51.020
You just started again.

58:51.153 --> 58:52.939
Feels like stirring up muck.

58:53.071 --> 58:54.857
That's the point of therapy.

58:54.990 --> 58:56.355
But I'm fed up.

58:56.491 --> 58:58.323
You sound like a fickle child.

58:58.452 --> 59:00.659
- I'm not fickle!
- You know you need it.

59:01.788 --> 59:03.904
- Did you talk to her about it?
- No.

59:04.041 --> 59:06.157
Do it.
I'm sure she'll understand.

59:07.210 --> 59:08.210
I don't like her.

59:09.796 --> 59:11.082
What do you mean?

59:11.506 --> 59:13.713
I want to please her so much
I hate her.

59:15.302 --> 59:17.043
I think about her constantly.

59:17.429 --> 59:19.011
I'd rather think about you.

59:21.266 --> 59:23.849
Great. That's transference.
It's a good sign.

59:25.187 --> 59:26.187
Is it?

59:26.730 --> 59:27.730
Yes.

59:28.482 --> 59:29.722
Stick with it.

59:30.150 --> 59:31.732
You'll feel better.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.267
Where the hell are you?

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:12.983
Sorry, I can't.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:14.318
Why not?

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.603
I'm afraid Paul suspects something.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:18.854
Did you tell him?

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.482
- Of course not.
- Then don't worry.

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:23.950
I'll expect you tomorrow.

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.974
I knew you'd like it.

01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:58.318
I did, but...

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.030
But what?

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:03.608
I want to try something else.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:05.661
Really?

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:06.996
What?

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:10.163
I want to fuck you.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:15.452
Don't want to?

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:17.871
Impossible.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.008
Why?

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:24.466
Isn't your therapy based on
exploring my repressed desires?

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:27.715
You need to do it with someone else.

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:29.602
Who?

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:36.773
Guess.

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:57.294
Did Paul change his name
to cut you out of his life?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.330
Of course.

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:01.508
What do you feel

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.091
for Paul?

01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:05.304
Nothing.

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:08.597
I rarely think of him.

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:12.217
People often confuse us, that's all.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:16.305
When they learn I'm his older brother,
they ask after him.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:17.522
Older brother?

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:19.816
I'm 15 minutes older.

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:22.985
Why the smile?

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.479
15 minutes isn't much.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:28.701
I was born 15 minutes sooner.
Head first.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:31.453
Paul came out afterwards,
feet first.

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:36.033
My mother suffered like hell.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:39.541
He made her lose a lot of blood.

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.249
I weighed 5 1/2 pounds.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:44.841
He was under 4 1/2.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:48.841
Even in my mother's uterus
I was the dominant twin.

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:52.515
I'm right-handed, he's left.

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:55.135
Our hair curls the opposite way.

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:58.602
His left eye is weak.
My right eye is.

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:02.442
We're mirror twins.

01:03:05.282 --> 01:03:07.694
In certain primitive cultures,

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:10.450
they'd kill the second-born twin

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:12.782
because he was weaker

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:15.663
and had less chance of survival.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:37.655
Good evening.
Reservation for Meyer.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:38.997
This way.

01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:47.591
You were right.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.504
We had a good talk.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:53.216
I learned a lot about myself.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:54.556
And about you.

01:04:55.934 --> 01:04:56.934
About me?

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.809
Why I was attracted to you,

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.397
why I love you.

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:07.400
My stomach pains are nearly gone.

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.604
That's good.
Keep it up. Take it further.

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:12.526
You'll feel even bet...

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.447
You're no longer my shrink, sir.

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:16.985
Just"

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:18.872
my lover.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:24.711
Chloé...

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:25.921
Yes?

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:30.419
Will you marry me?

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:32.630
Be my wife?

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.214
Can you help me?

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:26.146
Want to go in the bedroom?

01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:27.810
No, I'd rather do it here.

01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:40.993
Are you sure?

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.415
Go easy.

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:50.371
Easy.

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:51.997
- How's that?
- Ok.

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:55.552
Easy.

01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:30.744
You're hurting me.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:51.182
Was that your first time?

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:52.936
Of course.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.194
Did you like it?

01:07:58.741 --> 01:07:59.856
I did it for you.

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:32.805
Why don't you tell him?

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:34.933
He doesn't want children?

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.106
Sure, I think he does.

01:08:38.156 --> 01:08:40.613
My poor Chloé, you're lost.

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:43.984
You don't know if it's mine or his.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.444
But you can rest easy.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.492
We have the same genes.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:50.448
Stop it, Louis!

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:51.585
Enough.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:06.471
What's your secret, Louis?

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:10.014
I need to know now.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.639
What happened?

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:18.144
What made him
cut you out of his life?

01:09:20.198 --> 01:09:21.734
Please tell me.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:25.693
I'm pregnant
and Paul wants to marry me.

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:27.698
ASK him.

01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:30.404
It's your secret against his.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.327
What if you're the one

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:37.754
who's obsessed with him?

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:39.383
Jealous.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:42.504
In two seconds you've turned ugly.

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:46.595
You hate Paul.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.258
Because he's the real dominant twin.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:53.553
He fucked you in the ass.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.106
Get lost, Chloé.
Fuck off.

01:09:57.985 --> 01:09:59.567
Want me to leave?

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:04.822
Fine. I'll get my things.

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:07.947
I'm off.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:09.535
Paul's waiting for me.

01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:16.545
Get out!

01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:18.505
Bitch!

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:21.425
Stop!

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.050
Dirty whore!

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.387
Get your fetus out of here

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:28.515
before I kill you!

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:13.307
Milo...

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.105
This is a bit cold...

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.485
I'm pressing a little.

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:45.832
Is something wrong?

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.427
Hang on, let me look.

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:03.368
Hello Chloé.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.541
- I can't talk.
- Is he there?

01:13:05.673 --> 01:13:06.708
In the next room.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:08.206
I miss you, Chloé.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:09.965
Do you miss me'?

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:11.175
No, we're through.

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:13.677
Sorry for last time.
Let me make it up to you.

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:15.338
I want to fuck you.

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.383
- Enough, Louis.
- Surely you miss my cock.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:19.392
You're crazy!

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:21.394
- I want to see you again.
- No.

01:13:21.689 --> 01:13:23.680
I love making love
to pregnant women.

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:26.274
- I'm hanging up.
- Tomorrow, same time.

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.142
Shut up.

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.770
You're carrying my child.
Check the dates.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:32.272
Enough.
I'm hanging up.

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.361
Who was that?

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:40.113
A colleague from the museum.

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:42.285
About a scheduling problem.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:02.687
Paul!

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:06.348
- Is this a bad time?
- You've finally come!

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:10.268
A patient canceled.
I'll buy you lunch.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:11.404
Thanks.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.570
Charming place.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.988
My break's in 10 minutes, OK?

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:24.073
I'll have a look around.

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:25.210
See you in a bit.

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:34.425
Thought I forgot your birthday?

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:36.339
No, but you said nothing
this morning.

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:42.592
I hope you like it.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.427
I bet it's jewelry.

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:46.064
Good guess.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:51.017
Reminds me of Milo...

01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:52.776
Glad you like it.

01:14:53.614 --> 01:14:54.695
Thank you.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.337
Thought I was my brother?

01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:13.711
Calm down!

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:16.092
Sorry, but I had to see you.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.218
I want to resume our therapy.

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:20.046
I'll cure you.

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:21.224
Sir?

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:37.985
My darling, it's your birthday!

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:44.789
To our reunion...

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:46.124
Asshole.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:47.876
You turn me on.

01:15:47.918 --> 01:15:49.329
I don't know what's stopping me.

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:50.876
Our secret, Chloé!

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:56.378
Let me go.

01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:58.717
Has Paul mentioned our classmate?

01:15:58.846 --> 01:15:59.846
What?

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:03.719
Ask him about Sandra Schenker.
Then you'll understand.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:12.394
Happy birthday to you...

01:16:20.993 --> 01:16:22.199
Got you something...

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.618
What is it?

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:26.164
Guess.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.994
A cat-shaped brooch?

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:32.084
- That would be tasteless.
- Yes.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:39.042
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:41.423
It's beautiful.

01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:45.222
Thank you.

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:52.935
Ever see old classmates?

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:54.557
Why do you ask?

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:57.105
I ran into a friend
on the way home.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:17:00.609
I hadn't seen her in 1 O years.
Quite a surprise.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:04.109
We were once so close.
Now we have nothing to say.

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.452
Her name is Sandra...

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:09.705
Don't answer it.

01:17:11.001 --> 01:17:13.117
Another one of your patients.

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:15.461
I love when you're jealous
of my patients.

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:23.674
It's me.

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:26.933
Yes.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:28.810
Very well.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:31.268
8:30 tomorrow morning.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:32.397
Perfect.

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:33.812
See you then.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:37.479
Who was it?

01:17:38.195 --> 01:17:40.106
The taxi for the airport.

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:42.731
When'll you be back?

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:44.483
The seminar is 3 days.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:46.321
I'll be back Friday.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:25.399
The Delord Twins Bewitch The Crowds

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:33.406
I love you so much.
Your sweetheart, Sandra

01:18:49.433 --> 01:18:50.514
Hello?

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.725
May I speak to Sandra Schenker?

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:54.094
Who's calling?

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.892
I'm an old classmate of Sandra's.

01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:58.640
I was wondering how she is.

01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:00.687
My daughter doesn't go out anymore.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:03.982
Hasn't in a long time.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:06.655
Why doesn't she go out?

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:08.991
You don't know about the accident?

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:44.727
- Hello.
- Hello, madam.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:47.321
Antigone, her best role.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.907
She was also wonderful as Orphelia.

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:53.494
The production wasn't very good.
She was so young.

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.372
Before each performance,

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.959
she'd get down on her knees
and say a little prayer.

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:03.371
- Wasn't she beautiful?
- Yes.

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:06.291
She could've been a great actress.

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:09.718
She always seemed so strong.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:12.838
So intelligent.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.276
Say hello, Sandra.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:36.537
An old classmate has come to see you.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:37.780
Chloé.

01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:42.747
Go ahead, talk to her.
Don't be afraid.

01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:45.212
Hello, Sandra.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:49.625
You probably don't remember me.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:52.552
I'm Chloé.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.805
Sandra!

01:21:03.359 --> 01:21:05.441
Don't be impolite, darling.

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:07.602
It's Chloé!

01:21:07.738 --> 01:21:09.103
Look over there.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:16.285
She was so glad you were coming.

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:19.451
We got ourselves ready,
washed our hair,

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:20.618
styled it...

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:22.537
She chose her prettiest dress.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:23.830
For you.

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:28.213
She has her ups and downs.

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:30.754
Impossible to predict.

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:38.432
Excuse me...

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.010
I shouldn't have disturbed you.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:42.762
You're not disturbing us!

01:21:43.857 --> 01:21:45.347
Quite the contrary!

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:48.814
Are you OK?

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:57.197
Do you have time for a cup of tea?

01:21:58.372 --> 01:21:59.372
If you like.

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:01.117
Wonderful. Come.

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:05.664
They were such a perfect couple.

01:22:05.796 --> 01:22:08.083
Sandra and Paul,
Paul and Sandra.

01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:11.624
He was shy.
A charming boy.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.342
Unlike his twin.

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:14.718
A monster.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:20.926
He's the one who got her drunk,
pretending to be Paul.

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:24.770
Sandra had never
had a drop to drink.

01:22:24.898 --> 01:22:27.435
She was a serious girl.

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:30.480
Innocent

01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:33.354
A virgin.

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.071
What happened, happened.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:42.696
He raped her.

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.375
When Paul found out,

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:48.870
he became extremely violent.

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:51.171
He was so very jealous.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.462
He began to hate his brother.

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:56.051
He refused to see Sandra again.

01:22:56.763 --> 01:22:58.345
Sandra didn't understand.

01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:01.932
So she committed that act.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.552
Attempted suicide with a firearm.

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:12.477
When it comes to twins,

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.521
we assume if we know one,

01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:17.944
we know the other.

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:22.244
But the Delord brothers...

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:33.080
Did you know them too?

01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:35.384
Yes.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:38.802
But nothing bad ever happened to you?

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:42.515
No, I mean...

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:49.222
You were their victim too?

01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:52.187
What do you mean?

01:23:58.408 --> 01:23:59.614
But you...

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:02.822
you liked it!

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:04.904
Didn't you'?

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040
No.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:10.121
You little tramp.

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:12.585
You liked it.

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:14.459
Dirty hussy.

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:17.215
- Dirty hussy!
- I'll be going.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.136
I knew it.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.513
Little whore!

01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:04.023
Dear Chloé,
My cat gives you his heart.

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:05.945
And so do I.
He who truly loves you.

01:26:39.069 --> 01:26:40.069
Hello.

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:41.518
Is something wrong?

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:45.110
Paul is away. I don't feel safe.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:48.617
Is your daughter's room free?

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:52.988
Follow me.

01:26:56.670 --> 01:26:59.002
You'll feel better here.
Safer.

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:01.497
Come in.

01:27:06.221 --> 01:27:09.054
I was afraid
you were still mad about Milo.

01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:12.101
Here.

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:14.601
My daughter's nightgown.

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:16.725
Thank you very much.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.680
Chloé?

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:51.429
Wake up.

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.807
Someone's here for you.

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:04.231
Look who I found downstairs.

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:06.444
Milo!

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:07.823
My love...

01:28:10.202 --> 01:28:12.364
How'd you know I was here?

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:13.496
Hose told me.

01:28:14.664 --> 01:28:16.496
I asked her to watch over you.

01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:19.412
Let's go home.

01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:32.596
Sorry, I should've told you.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:34.340
Yes, you should've.

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:37.351
If I'd known about your brother,
we'd have avoided all this.

01:28:37.521 --> 01:28:38.521
All this?

01:28:39.272 --> 01:28:41.559
Yes, you didn't tell me the truth.

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:43.728
You made me seek it out.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:47.194
Dig into your life,
your belongings.

01:28:48.073 --> 01:28:49.359
Why?

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:51.824
Because I love you.

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:57.037
I never wanted
to hear that story again.

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:00.040
My brother,

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:01.825
Sandra.

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:07.214
I tried so hard to forget.

01:29:11.555 --> 01:29:13.011
She betrayed me.

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:17.512
He soiled her.

01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:21.019
I broke up with her because...

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:23.146
I stopped loving her.

01:29:24.067 --> 01:29:25.728
I had no feelings left.

01:29:26.903 --> 01:29:28.940
I felt only pity for her.

01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:32.273
It wasn't Sandra's fault.

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.697
Your brother pretended he was you.

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:38.036
He tricked her, then raped her.

01:29:38.164 --> 01:29:39.164
Not at all.

01:29:39.749 --> 01:29:41.660
Sandra was attracted to him.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:44.455
She only wanted me
because I was his twin.

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:46.662
He's the one she wanted.

01:29:47.841 --> 01:29:49.047
What do you think?

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:52.843
That she was the victim
of two diabolical brothers?

01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:54.346
No.

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:56.471
She's responsible too.

01:29:59.269 --> 01:30:00.509
Her fascination...

01:30:01.187 --> 01:30:02.677
her lust...

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:04.020
for twins.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:07.482
That's what killed her.

01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:08.611
She's still living!

01:30:09.779 --> 01:30:11.315
Living dead...

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:20.953
Good morning, Chloé.

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:24.658
Sleep well?

01:30:25.337 --> 01:30:28.250
I made you
my daughter's favorite cake.

01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:31.581
Excuse me.

01:30:34.554 --> 01:30:35.589
I've got to go.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.643
Why'd you lie to me?

01:30:52.155 --> 01:30:53.862
- Who is this?
- Me.

01:30:54.366 --> 01:30:56.073
- Paul?
- Yes.

01:30:56.993 --> 01:30:57.993
You're back?

01:30:58.078 --> 01:31:01.571
Wexler was at the seminar.
She's never heard of you.

01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:02.867
But...

01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:04.364
Why'd you lie to me?

01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:07.083
- Got a lover?
- No.

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:08.373
I have to explain.

01:31:08.505 --> 01:31:09.961
Am I the father?

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:12.174
Hello?

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:30.565
Finally.

01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:32.643
Nice to see my old patient.

01:31:32.779 --> 01:31:33.985
Hands off!

01:31:37.909 --> 01:31:40.401
Weren't you happy
to get my heart?

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.572
Did you really think
it was his heart?

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:47.116
You know I love that beast.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:50.578
Enough, Louis!
I saw Sandra and her mother.

01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:52.704
I know what you did.

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:55.340
You destroy everything.

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.297
The whole thing was absurd and tragic.

01:32:00.306 --> 01:32:02.263
Sandra was a beautiful girl.

01:32:03.476 --> 01:32:05.217
But completely hysterical.

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:09.764
That little bitch
cried rape to my brother.

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:11.191
You're lying.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:15.193
Did her mother mention
Sandra was pregnant?

01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:17.020
By me, obviously.

01:32:19.075 --> 01:32:20.075
It's funny.

01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:22.860
Looking at you now,
I feel I'm seeing her.

01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:25.116
The same greedy mouth...

01:32:25.248 --> 01:32:26.488
You're a monster.

01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:28.080
There are no monsters.

01:32:28.376 --> 01:32:30.162
Only human beings. Like you,

01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:31.456
me...

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.086
and Paul.

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:38.135
My god.

01:32:39.012 --> 01:32:40.673
Sandra Schenker returns.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:42.136
I won't end up like her.

01:32:42.599 --> 01:32:44.431
She should've killed you, Louis.

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:46.766
Are you quite sure, my dear Chloé,

01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:49.098
that I'm Louis...

01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:52.431
and not Paul?

01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:55.444
Freeze or I'll shoot!

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:57.439
What're you doing?

01:32:57.781 --> 01:32:59.613
I believe we have a guest.

01:33:03.703 --> 01:33:04.703
Paul?

01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:06.077
My brother told me everything.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:08.868
You shouldn't have lied to us.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.661
You made Sandra's mistake.

01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:11.659
Stop!

01:33:11.795 --> 01:33:13.285
- Put down the gun.
- Surrender.

01:33:14.672 --> 01:33:16.162
So we can both fuck you!

01:33:16.299 --> 01:33:18.085
That's what you want.

01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:19.504
To fuck twins like Sandra!

01:33:19.636 --> 01:33:20.967
Shut up, both of you!

01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.011
Who's Paul?

01:33:24.307 --> 01:33:25.307
It's me, Chloé.

01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:26.433
It's me, Chloé.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:27.768
It's me.

01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:29.969
You can see I'm Paul, not Louis.

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:34.390
Is this what you want?

01:33:34.526 --> 01:33:35.937
Like with Sandra'?

01:33:36.486 --> 01:33:39.353
Whoever I am, don't shoot.
You're carrying my child.

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:42.238
If you kill one of us,

01:33:42.659 --> 01:33:44.115
you'll lose the other.

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:46.067
Think of your sister.

01:33:46.496 --> 01:33:48.078
You're a double, too.

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:43.544
Hello, Paul.

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:58.051
I'm so angry at myself.

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:01.558
It's not your fault.

01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:03.978
My daughter's always been fragile.

01:37:04.402 --> 01:37:05.984
I refused to see.

01:37:07.155 --> 01:37:09.647
I thought loving her
would keep her safe.

01:37:09.782 --> 01:37:11.364
Help her live.

01:37:11.492 --> 01:37:13.608
Love has never saved anyone.

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:20.369
Mr. Meyer?
You may come in.

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:21.501
How is she?

01:37:21.711 --> 01:37:23.122
Better this morning.

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:24.540
She's eating now.

01:37:25.381 --> 01:37:28.419
She's recovered from the operation.
She can go home.

01:37:29.302 --> 01:37:31.669
Did you talk to her
about the baby?

01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:33.010
Of course.

01:37:33.139 --> 01:37:35.722
It was difficult to hear,
or even comprehend.

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:37.090
But I think she understood.

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.304
As you can see
on the x-ray images,

01:37:40.063 --> 01:37:43.181
the growth
Chloé took for a pregnancy

01:37:43.316 --> 01:37:45.353
was actually a cyst weighing

01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:46.975
nearly 2 pounds.

01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:49.363
And...

01:37:49.655 --> 01:37:52.317
here's what we removed
from her belly.

01:37:52.909 --> 01:37:55.150
It's a bit hard to look at.

01:37:57.497 --> 01:37:59.488
It looks shocking in the photos,

01:37:59.624 --> 01:38:02.662
but it's only fifteen centimeters long.

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.383
Could this explain her mental state?

01:38:12.512 --> 01:38:15.971
Learning she was carrying
not a baby but her unborn twin,

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:19.349
triggered an emotional shock

01:38:19.519 --> 01:38:21.135
and inhibited her sexuality.

01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:23.310
So that means

01:38:24.482 --> 01:38:25.847
I was carrying

01:38:26.317 --> 01:38:27.523
two fetuses?

01:38:27.652 --> 01:38:28.517
Yes.

01:38:28.653 --> 01:38:30.690
At the start of your pregnancy.

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:34.572
- I could have had twin girls?
- Yes.

01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:37.863
If the second fetus had developed
normally and not been absorbed

01:38:37.995 --> 01:38:39.201
by Chloé's.

01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:43.619
Do you remember the ultrasounds
from your pregnancy?

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:44.751
No.

01:38:46.838 --> 01:38:49.626
I realized very late I was pregnant.

01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:54.217
Chloé was not...

01:38:54.887 --> 01:38:56.173
a wanted child.

01:38:56.305 --> 01:38:57.386
I understand.

01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:09.109
Hello.

01:39:16.367 --> 01:39:17.152
Chloé?

01:39:17.285 --> 01:39:19.868
Paul and your mother
have come for you.

01:39:20.163 --> 01:39:21.449
Hello, honey.

01:39:22.665 --> 01:39:24.451
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:27.075
Hello, Chloé.

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.376
I'll leave you to it.

01:39:29.505 --> 01:39:30.620
Thank you.

01:39:31.299 --> 01:39:33.461
The doctor says you're doing better.

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:35.546
- No more pain?
- No.

01:39:35.887 --> 01:39:37.798
I don't feel my stomach anymore.

01:39:38.389 --> 01:39:39.470
Good.

01:39:42.477 --> 01:39:44.059
Aren't you sad?

01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:46.310
- About what?
- Not having a baby.

01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:52.400
We have plenty of time.

01:39:52.695 --> 01:39:54.561
You'll get pregnant soon.

01:39:56.282 --> 01:39:57.647
Did you see Sandra?

01:39:58.618 --> 01:39:59.618
Sandra?

01:40:00.036 --> 01:40:01.447
Yes, my twin.

01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:03.079
The fetus.

01:40:04.457 --> 01:40:05.457
No.

01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:07.292
Of course not.

01:40:09.587 --> 01:40:12.796
It says on internet I'm a cannibal twin.

01:40:12.924 --> 01:40:13.924
The exact term

01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:15.415
is parasitic.

01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:16.551
A parasitic twin.

01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:24.132
I devoured my twin sister
in your womb.

01:40:25.561 --> 01:40:27.347
She was inside me.

01:40:27.813 --> 01:40:29.053
No, Chloé.

01:40:30.483 --> 01:40:33.396
You didn't devour her,
you absorbed her.

01:40:33.528 --> 01:40:35.018
It wasn't your fault.

01:40:35.613 --> 01:40:37.604
It never became a fetus.

01:40:38.741 --> 01:40:41.324
It was just some sort of a growth

01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:43.068
with limbs and bones.

01:40:48.668 --> 01:40:50.329
It was my sister.

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.846
Get home safe.

01:41:24.996 --> 01:41:27.203
I know you've always
been angry with me.

01:41:27.832 --> 01:41:30.290
I wasn't there when you needed me.

01:41:31.544 --> 01:41:33.251
But now I will be.

01:41:33.838 --> 01:41:35.249
For you.

01:41:37.425 --> 01:41:39.462
You're my daughter, Chloé.

01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:46.180
My one and only.

01:42:26.515 --> 01:42:27.630
Feeling OK?

01:42:31.896 --> 01:42:34.183
Ever wish you had a brother, Paul?

01:42:35.858 --> 01:42:37.440
Enough of that.

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:39.775
It's over.

01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:45.740
Yes.
