00:25.442 --> 00:28.444
First, there was
the collapse of civilization:

00:28.611 --> 00:33.657
...anarchy, genocide, starvation.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.326
Then, when it seemed
things couldn't get any worse...

00:36.494 --> 00:38.495
...we got the plague

00:38.663 --> 00:40.497
...the living death...

00:40.665 --> 00:43.834
...quickly closing its fist
over the entire planet.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.754
And then we heard the rumors...

00:46.921 --> 00:49.548
...that the last scientists
were working on a cure...

00:49.716 --> 00:53.343
...that would end the plague
and restore the world.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.306
Restore it? Why?

00:57.974 --> 01:00.684
I like the death.

01:00.852 --> 01:03.312
I like the misery!

01:03.480 --> 01:07.316
I like this world!

01:10.820 --> 01:13.322
Come on, Pearl! It's clear.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.951
I think we lost Fender and his pirates.

01:18.912 --> 01:23.165
We've got a chance to reach
the Prox township and hire a slinger.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.668
Get... Get going, Pearl.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.253
I'll try to hold them here.

01:29.672 --> 01:31.340
Find a slinger to help you, Pearl.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.008
Now!

03:09.272 --> 03:11.231
Get her.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.901
- Let her go!
- To Atlanta?

03:14.068 --> 03:16.945
To cure the plague
with the information she has.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.614
I wanna own it.

03:20.491 --> 03:21.533
Own the cure?

03:21.701 --> 03:24.119
I'd be a god!

03:24.287 --> 03:27.789
- But the misery could be stopped.
- I like the misery.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.292
- The world could be changed.
- I like this world.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.752
Go to hell!

03:34.172 --> 03:36.089
Been there.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.139
Thanks.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.726
Wait!

06:37.980 --> 06:39.439
Who are you?

06:41.275 --> 06:43.485
Why did you help me?

06:46.989 --> 06:50.075
I thought it was somebody else.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.372
I can trust you.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.668
For what?

06:59.836 --> 07:02.337
To get me back to Atlanta.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.715
There's a group of doctors there,
the last ones.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.683
They've been working
on a cure for the plague.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.803
They need information I have.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.182
I swear it's the truth.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.692
I'm a cyborg.

07:30.491 --> 07:34.327
They created me to retrieve data from
the computer system here in the city.

07:38.833 --> 07:39.833
Slinger!

08:02.106 --> 08:04.941
That slinger can't help you now.

08:10.281 --> 08:12.240
I'll take you to Atlanta...

08:12.408 --> 08:14.242
...and you'll give me the cure.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.162
And if you don't...

08:17.330 --> 08:20.081
...I'll give you the horror show.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.624
Get me back to Atlanta.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.418
There's a group of doctors there,
the last ones.

09:05.586 --> 09:09.673
They've been working on a cure for the
plague. They need information I have.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.916
You think we're gonna swim
all the way to Atlanta?

09:47.503 --> 09:50.672
I... can't... swim...

09:50.840 --> 09:53.842
...asshole! I hate the water!

09:54.844 --> 09:57.679
Hey, I caught a nice fish here!

09:57.847 --> 10:00.015
Aaagh!

10:21.203 --> 10:24.205
Hoist anchor, mates!

10:27.460 --> 10:31.838
We got us a skin-job to take to Atlanta!

12:48.142 --> 12:50.727
Say your final goodbyes to your daddy...

12:50.895 --> 12:52.854
...and let's be on our way.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.734
I'm losing money. Let's go.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.917
I don't know if I really trust you.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.754
I don't know if there's really
any difference between slingers...

13:17.922 --> 13:20.715
...and the pirates that killed my pa.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.970
But I guess I ain't got no choice.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.766
You're the only guy that answered
the posting for the pay.

13:33.395 --> 13:35.605
Just get us out of this city.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.023
It's what I do.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.404
Get people out of the city.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.740
Let's go.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.347
You're good with them.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.272
I like them.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.376
- It's beautiful.
- We'll be safe here.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.211
Um...

16:03.379 --> 16:05.588
Are you looking for that woman?

16:08.342 --> 16:12.011
I heard the pirates say
she has a cure for the plague.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.305
They're taking her to Atlanta.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.765
Atlanta.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.833
The pirates wanted a boat.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.382
All this for a stupid boat.

16:51.051 --> 16:53.469
Why are you still alive?

16:54.430 --> 16:56.347
I hid when they came.

16:57.766 --> 17:01.644
I saw them setting off
down the waterway to Charleston.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.939
I was just getting ready to take off
when you showed up.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.693
I figured you for one of the pirates.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.950
I'm gone.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.922
So, are you going after
that woman with the cure?

17:30.090 --> 17:31.841
To save her from the pirates?

17:32.009 --> 17:33.801
I'd like to help.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.220
My family died from the plague.

17:36.388 --> 17:39.057
So did most everybody else I've known.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.505
So as soon as I heard the pirates
talk about this woman...

17:41.643 --> 17:44.312
...I knew I had to do something to help.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.022
Keep moving.

17:46.190 --> 17:48.149
You don't want my help?

17:48.317 --> 17:51.444
- No.
- Think you can rescue her by yourself?

17:51.612 --> 17:53.821
It's not my business.

17:53.989 --> 17:57.992
You're not gonna try to save this woman?
You don't care?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.952
Well, what do you care about?

18:00.120 --> 18:02.038
Fender.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.957
There's a cure for the plague
and you don't give a shit?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.667
What kind ofjerk are you?

18:06.835 --> 18:09.837
- Why don't you rescue her?
- Maybe I will.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.509
You know, the short cut
to Charleston's a free road.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.719
You can't stop me from traveling.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.471
Good luck!

18:37.449 --> 18:39.200
Not too much.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.073
So do you think we'll find Fender?

19:37.384 --> 19:38.926
We'll get him.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.972
Tell me something.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.932
I tried to kill you.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.270
So why did you stay with me
while I was knocked out?

19:51.148 --> 19:54.108
Sort of goes
against your hard-ass style.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.363
It's because I felt sorry for you.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.412
The man has a heart.

20:45.619 --> 20:49.288
Fender's making his way down the
inter-coastal waterway to Charleston.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.707
He stopped for wood
at Hatteras yesterday.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.876
Torched a settlement there.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.213
I'll catch up with him.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.758
Where the ocean meets
the road to Atlanta.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.928
Folks generally make it a point
to stay out of Fender's path, Gibs.

21:05.180 --> 21:07.265
Not go looking to kill him.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.728
I heard you'd given it up.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.107
Found some peace in the country.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.954
This is going to be our home.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.712
You said you wanted a change.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.841
Stay with us?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.884
Just for a little while?

21:59.609 --> 22:02.069
I was a fool, Maze.

22:02.237 --> 22:04.697
I started to believe in the dream.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.700
Everybody's gotta have a dream,
Gibs. A little hope.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.202
Ha, look at old Maze!

22:10.370 --> 22:12.872
Got my bar, family.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.457
How's that for hope?

22:20.005 --> 22:23.424
Make sure you put your knives on
for the right reason, son.

22:23.592 --> 22:27.094
What if you kill Fender? What then?

22:28.263 --> 22:30.598
What about the rest of your life?

22:51.620 --> 22:54.080
So the cure's not important, huh?

23:03.465 --> 23:06.342
I got your ball!

23:09.096 --> 23:12.098
Knock it off,
or I'll bash your brains out.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.311
Hey!

23:17.437 --> 23:19.397
I don't think this is yours.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.068
Hey, kid.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.217
Are you crazy?
This is the Wasteland.

24:30.385 --> 24:34.221
- We can't go through here.
- Fender has a boat. We're walking.

24:34.389 --> 24:36.724
You want the cure. I want Fender.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.085
Short cut to Charleston, my ass!
We are lost.

25:13.803 --> 25:15.429
Typical.

28:07.519 --> 28:08.977
Son of a bitch!

28:22.701 --> 28:24.493
You're pretty good.

28:32.460 --> 28:36.797
- Do you ever get used to it?
- Used to what?

28:36.965 --> 28:38.549
The killing.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.931
I didn't make this world.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.354
Yeah, you only live in it.

29:02.365 --> 29:04.533
Fender's boat will pass here.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.162
Good.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.164
Then we're stopping.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.740
You're just a walking wound, aren't you?

29:46.534 --> 29:47.659
Sorry.

29:47.827 --> 29:50.954
I like scars, really.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.713
So what did Fender do to you?

30:05.929 --> 30:08.680
You know, if you let me help you...

30:10.308 --> 30:11.850
...you can help me.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.310
No.

30:15.230 --> 30:18.232
You still don't think
that woman is worth saving?

30:20.693 --> 30:23.153
I don't want to see you die.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.992
I don't wanna see you die either.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.459
You're not gonna be here in the morning
when I wake up, are you?

32:26.986 --> 32:28.779
It's OK.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.603
What is it?

33:02.730 --> 33:04.523
Fender.

34:05.168 --> 34:09.379
You were chosen because of
your matrix engineering background...

34:09.547 --> 34:13.050
...and the make-up of your personality.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.802
You are the perfect choice
for this mission.

34:15.969 --> 34:19.264
However, I think it's important...

34:19.431 --> 34:22.434
...that you understand
the ramifications of your decision.

34:22.601 --> 34:26.563
I wouldn't have volunteered
if I didn't understand the consequences.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.483
After the operation...

34:30.902 --> 34:34.029
...you will never
be the same again, Pearl.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.739
The plague has destroyed so much.

34:38.451 --> 34:42.661
We've lost our humanity.
We've lost our purpose.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.623
There's no meaning in this world.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.375
I wanna change that.

35:06.395 --> 35:08.271
I'll bring back
the data you need.

35:08.439 --> 35:10.857
I swear it.

35:14.028 --> 35:15.654
Good luck, Pearl.

35:18.574 --> 35:22.786
Don't worry, Pearl.
I'll get you to New York - and back.

35:41.722 --> 35:44.850
We'll dock and reach
the inland road by noon.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.790
Fender's boat.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.792
Stay next to me.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.020
Who are they?

36:32.773 --> 36:34.858
Take 'em out.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.195
Move!

37:04.388 --> 37:06.139
- Wait here.
- I'm not gonna stay here!

37:06.307 --> 37:08.058
I want you out of my way...

37:08.226 --> 37:11.102
...until I see what's going on.

37:11.270 --> 37:15.982
Look, I'm here to make sure
that woman lives.

37:16.150 --> 37:19.486
And I'm not gonna let you do anything
that could hurt her.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.821
Nothing's going to happen to her.

37:21.989 --> 37:24.115
It's a promise.

37:25.034 --> 37:26.826
A promise.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.600
Fuck it!

38:09.704 --> 38:12.622
Oh, shit.

39:26.405 --> 39:27.781
Hyahh!

40:18.499 --> 40:19.499
Fuck!

40:46.026 --> 40:47.902
Come on!

41:13.804 --> 41:14.804
Motherfucker!

42:00.643 --> 42:03.269
I told my sister
that slingers kill pirates.

42:03.437 --> 42:05.605
I'm gonna be a slinger some day.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.399
No, you're not.

42:08.567 --> 42:10.818
You'll do something better, Haley.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.037
Go!

43:21.515 --> 43:23.683
You, keep an eye on her.

43:45.581 --> 43:47.206
Move!

44:52.398 --> 44:53.398
Come on.

44:53.524 --> 44:58.486
I'm not going with you. You're not
strong enough to get me to Atlanta.

44:58.654 --> 45:02.031
Fender would eventually catch us.
Maybe kill me.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.283
Certainly kill you.

45:04.451 --> 45:06.452
Look, Fender must be destroyed.

45:06.620 --> 45:08.538
In Atlanta, we have the means.

45:08.706 --> 45:10.707
I'll lead him to his death.

45:12.084 --> 45:14.377
Nothing can stop him in this world.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.296
Not even you.

45:19.967 --> 45:20.967
You!

45:35.649 --> 45:37.817
You take her!

46:41.548 --> 46:43.633
Here!

46:48.555 --> 46:50.223
Over here!

47:03.070 --> 47:04.987
Here!

49:20.248 --> 49:22.917
- Can you make it?
- Yeah.

49:54.908 --> 49:58.244
I guess I should have stayed put, huh?

50:10.924 --> 50:12.758
Come on.

50:14.636 --> 50:16.345
Let's go. Let's go.

50:56.636 --> 51:00.139
Run! Run!

55:08.555 --> 55:11.348
Stand him up!

58:02.770 --> 58:04.646
Let's go.

58:43.311 --> 58:45.646
Haley.

58:52.278 --> 58:54.112
Haley!

59:04.249 --> 59:06.542
What's wrong with you?

59:57.260 --> 59:59.261
You're good with them.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.935
I like them.

01:00:09.063 --> 01:00:10.981
They like you, Gibs.

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:36.131
This is going to be our home.

01:00:39.218 --> 01:00:41.094
Stay with us?

01:00:41.262 --> 01:00:43.263
Just for a little while?

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.016
It's up to you, honey.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.063
If you can hold them, they'll live.

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:26.838
Fender!

01:05:52.573 --> 01:05:54.950
I told you you were gonna need my help.

01:06:13.427 --> 01:06:15.845
What's waiting in Atlanta?

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:21.559
What I told you.
The last of the old world.

01:06:23.562 --> 01:06:26.564
What's waiting for me, cyborg?

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:28.108
Whatever you want.

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:31.069
Guns. Weapons.

01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:34.614
The cure, if they find it.

01:06:36.033 --> 01:06:38.410
Life.

01:06:38.577 --> 01:06:40.996
Death.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.622
Death?

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:45.875
You think you can stop me there.

01:06:46.043 --> 01:06:47.752
No, we have a deal.

01:06:49.922 --> 01:06:51.923
You'll fail.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.884
Of course I would.
I know how strong you are.

01:06:55.052 --> 01:06:56.886
Don't look down on me!

01:06:57.054 --> 01:06:58.930
I don't.

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:09.579
Move!

01:10:18.797 --> 01:10:20.298
Go!

01:10:52.122 --> 01:10:53.122
No!

01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:06.010
Come with me. Hurry!

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.544
I kill slingers!

01:12:08.532 --> 01:12:10.491
Aaaaagh!

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:18.703
Stop it!

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:31.966
Please.

01:15:14.259 --> 01:15:17.512
Nady!

01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:38.074
- Fender!
- Fucker!

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:45.998
Hey, come on!

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:18.990
Fuck you!

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.650
Haley.

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:18.455
Welcome home, Pearl.

01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:23.627
- Were you able to retrieve the data?
- Yes, I was.

01:21:23.795 --> 01:21:26.171
Thanks to this man.

01:21:28.425 --> 01:21:30.676
Stay with us, Gibson.

01:21:32.929 --> 01:21:36.265
They need us out there. Let's go.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.645
It's strange.

01:21:41.813 --> 01:21:44.398
But I feel he's the real cure
for this world.
