Life's full of disappointments.

10:17.145 --> 10:18.610
Okay. Make it 10%,

10:18.612 --> 10:21.313
and you've got yourself
a concierge doctor.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.421
I would have settled for 5.

10:28.423 --> 10:30.156
I would have paid 15.

10:30.158 --> 10:33.126
[Cell phone ringing]
Hm.

10:33.128 --> 10:34.628

Whoa, what?

10:36.299 --> 10:37.732
Dude, I need you 24/7.

10:37.734 --> 10:39.700
Aw, sorry, bud.

10:39.702 --> 10:42.804
Can't get a full-time doctor
with part-time money.

10:42.806 --> 10:45.240
Life's full of disappointments, huh?

10:49.478 --> 10:52.380
It's me, again.

10:52.382 --> 10:54.482
I know that you are busy,

10:54.484 --> 10:57.184
but please call me.

11:04.792 --> 11:05.792
Ms. Novak?

11:05.794 --> 11:08.763
[Beeping]

11:08.765 --> 11:10.965
Sorry to interrupt your... lunch?

11:10.967 --> 11:12.434
A three hour eat-a-thon.

11:12.436 --> 11:14.069
It's my training for the competition.

11:14.071 --> 11:15.237
Of course.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.672
Well, how is it going?

11:16.674 --> 11:20.043
Great, except for the nausea
and vomiting I called you about.

11:20.045 --> 11:21.811
I can't imagine what's causing it.

11:21.813 --> 11:23.880
I never get sick when
I'm training or competing.

11:23.882 --> 11:25.215
It's very strange.

11:25.217 --> 11:27.784
So you have been blessed
with a petite figure,

11:27.786 --> 11:30.153
and an iron stomach.

11:30.155 --> 11:33.122
How many lobster rolls
can you eat in ten minutes?

11:33.124 --> 11:35.191
- 47.
- Get out!

11:35.193 --> 11:36.391
But that will go down

11:36.393 --> 11:38.226
if I keep losing it during training.

11:38.228 --> 11:40.061
I may be competing against amateurs,

11:40.063 --> 11:42.096
but I take nothing for granted.

11:42.098 --> 11:43.831
Plus, I don't want to let down my sponsor,

11:43.833 --> 11:45.366
who rented me this house.

11:45.368 --> 11:46.434
But I'm more concerned with why

11:46.436 --> 11:48.403
you're experiencing these symptoms.

11:48.405 --> 11:50.138
Yeah, that too.

11:52.174 --> 11:55.810
Your gall bladder
and your appendix look fine.

11:55.812 --> 11:57.779
So, what does that mean?

11:57.781 --> 12:01.384
It means that a full G.I. workup is next.

12:01.386 --> 12:03.653
Can we do that after my next meal?

12:03.655 --> 12:05.988
On the contrary,
you'll need to fast for a bit,

12:05.990 --> 12:07.524
considering your lunch portions.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.325
Then go right to the hospital.

12:09.327 --> 12:10.294
That will interrupt my training.

12:10.296 --> 12:11.829
I can't interrupt my training.

12:11.831 --> 12:16.134
Rosie, the way that you eat is
an invitation to gastroparesis.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.568
What's that?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.338
It's a form of stomach paralysis.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.974
That wouldn't be good for me.

12:21.976 --> 12:25.010
The accumulation of food could
cause an obstruction,

12:25.012 --> 12:26.778
possible perforation,

12:26.780 --> 12:27.913
and that would interrupt your training

12:27.915 --> 12:29.915
and a whole lot more, permanently.

13:08.119 --> 13:10.020
Great, I'll text you the address.

13:10.022 --> 13:12.055
Awesome, see you then.

13:12.057 --> 13:15.926
Did you buy my shares
to use them against Hank?

13:15.928 --> 13:17.428
What?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.796
How could you think that?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.365
One, you bought my shares.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.867
Two, you used them against Hank.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.469
I see how you could think that.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.270
Why did you buy my shares?

13:26.272 --> 13:28.472
To help you. Divya, I swear.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.974
It was not premeditated.

13:29.976 --> 13:34.210
Hank... we were fighting.

13:34.212 --> 13:37.780
I just wanted him to take
me seriously, for once.

13:37.782 --> 13:42.484
So, I used whatever I had at my disposal.

13:42.486 --> 13:45.353
Can you imagine how he took it?

13:45.355 --> 13:48.123
Maybe it was not the best approach.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.692
Oh, Evan.

13:50.694 --> 13:54.129
You believe me, though.

13:54.131 --> 13:58.065
Being vengeful didn't
really sound like you.

13:58.067 --> 14:01.969
Acting impulsively, ah, textbook you.

Of course I believe you.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.653

14:16.655 --> 14:18.756
but he just seems a little off.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.458
He's got a terrible headache,
and, of course,

14:20.460 --> 14:22.627
he refuses to let me take his temperature.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.762
Ernie, come on, can I help
you with that, please?

14:24.764 --> 14:26.163
I'm good, Jill.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.933
I don't need a helper,
and I don't need a doctor.

14:28.935 --> 14:32.135
Uh, yeah, uh, actually, Ernie,
I came to check on your cast

14:32.137 --> 14:34.237
and make sure you don't have
any tenderness in your hand.

14:34.239 --> 14:37.173
Hand good. Cast good.

14:37.175 --> 14:39.308
- All good.
- Uh, okay.

Any other issues?

14:40.711 --> 14:43.479
Well, I have, uh, three younger siblings,

14:43.481 --> 14:46.316
an ex-wife, and a teenage son.

14:49.554 --> 14:50.954
Little bit of a headache.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.423
So what?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.525
I just need to make sure
it's not connected to your hand.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.528
No, I think it's, uh, more
connected to this conversation.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.197
So I'm gonna go get myself an advil.

14:59.199 --> 15:02.300
- Excuse me.
- Uh, okay.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.402
Hey, if you see Luke anywhere,
send him to the kitchen.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.203
He needs to man the fryer.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.706
I thought Luke left for chess camp.

15:08.708 --> 15:09.940
He did.

15:09.942 --> 15:14.911
He put him on the bus himself an hour ago.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.218
Is all this really necessary?

15:19.220 --> 15:21.387
When I checked your eyes,
I found swelling that indicates

15:21.389 --> 15:23.656
increased intracranial pressure.

15:23.658 --> 15:26.359
Plus, you forgot Luke left.

15:26.361 --> 15:28.161
So, yes. It's necessary.

15:28.163 --> 15:30.464
I'm a little stressed out, that's all.

15:30.466 --> 15:31.732
Okay, the C.T. is clean.

15:31.734 --> 15:33.600
So, can I get back to the pier?

15:33.602 --> 15:36.670
Because Harborfest isn't gonna
wait for intracranial pressure.

15:36.672 --> 15:37.904
Sure, right after a spinal tap.

15:37.906 --> 15:38.939
Are you serious?

15:38.941 --> 15:40.240
I need to rule out encephalitis.

15:40.242 --> 15:41.975
How long will that take?

15:41.977 --> 15:44.143
Ernie, he's gonna put
a needle in your spine,

15:44.145 --> 15:47.246
so, let's focus on precision, not speed.

15:47.248 --> 15:48.680
Have you met my sister, Jill?

15:48.682 --> 15:50.649
She's the one always wanting
to take care of everyone...

15:50.651 --> 15:51.716
- Uh-huh.
- And everything.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.985
And Ernie's lucky to have her.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.187
Next thing Ernie knows,

15:55.189 --> 15:56.555
she'll make him go to chess camp.

15:56.557 --> 15:58.757
Luke's a genius. He wanted to go.

15:58.759 --> 16:00.693
He worships you. He always has.

16:00.695 --> 16:02.462
So, if aunt Jill is going on vacation,

16:02.464 --> 16:04.997
now, of course, Luke wants one too.

16:04.999 --> 16:06.566
Hank will just wait until
you guys finish talking

16:06.568 --> 16:08.769
before he sticks a needle
in Ernie's spine.

16:08.771 --> 16:11.505
I'm just gonna prep the anesthetic.

16:11.507 --> 16:12.506
Okay.

16:12.508 --> 16:16.677
You're gonna feel a little pinch.

16:16.679 --> 16:20.580

chapter in my life,

Harborfests I'm going to miss,

16:30.724 --> 16:32.791
I bet you're home by Christmas.

17:07.065 --> 17:08.263
There's champagne in there?

17:08.266 --> 17:09.933
'Cause I'm more of a beer guy myself.

17:09.935 --> 17:11.635
Uh, no, that just means it's clear,

17:11.637 --> 17:13.804
but I still don't know what's
causing the swelling.

17:13.806 --> 17:15.538
So, now what?

17:15.540 --> 17:18.407
We get the fluid to Hamptons
Heritage for a closer look.

17:18.410 --> 17:19.609
Okay, I'll put a rush on it.

17:19.612 --> 17:21.345
Um...

Yeah, and to stretch her stomach.

19:48.158 --> 19:49.657
Right.

19:52.595 --> 19:55.096
Uh, what's this?

19:55.098 --> 19:58.133
It's a loan application, from the bank.

the shares out of the equation.

Cramping, to go along with
your confusion, and spasming.

20:55.022 --> 20:57.523
You're competing in the eat-off,
aren't you?

20:57.525 --> 20:59.191
Damn straight, I am.

20:59.193 --> 21:00.793
Enough's enough.

21:00.795 --> 21:03.028
I'm not gonna let a pro take that trophy.

21:03.030 --> 21:05.496
So I'm gonna eat 1 or maybe 40

21:05.498 --> 21:07.198
for the little guy.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.367
And how much have you been
drinking for the little guy?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.369
A few gallons here, a few there.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.737
Polydipsia.

21:12.739 --> 21:15.273
You overwhelmed your kidneys
to the point of toxicity.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.608
If you keep it up, the increased
pressure in your skull

21:17.610 --> 21:19.109
could cause your brain to herniate,

21:19.111 --> 21:21.211
- which could ultimately be fatal.
- From water?

21:21.213 --> 21:22.679
Too much of anything can hurt you.

21:22.681 --> 21:24.047
The problem didn't start
in your head, Ernie,

21:24.049 --> 21:26.082
it started in your stomach.

21:26.084 --> 21:28.685
Cut back to normal consumption,
and you should be okay.

21:28.687 --> 21:32.956
I'm sure you'll win
the eat-off next summer.

21:35.492 --> 21:36.726
Good news.

21:36.728 --> 21:40.698
No gastroparesis, no ulcers,

21:40.700 --> 21:42.599
and no obstruction.

21:42.601 --> 21:43.601
Oh!

21:43.603 --> 21:46.103
Rosie?
[Machine beeps]

21:46.105 --> 21:47.772
Rosie, what happened?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.306
I have no idea.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.975
Okay, lie down.

21:53.746 --> 21:57.515
[Exhales]

21:57.517 --> 21:59.684
I've been doing some homework
on competitive eating.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.019
It can lead to glucose swings.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.287
I guess that makes sense.

22:03.289 --> 22:07.524
I need to check your levels, okay?

22:07.526 --> 22:10.193
Hey, Rosie, what made you decide to become

22:10.195 --> 22:12.262
a full-time competitive eater?

22:12.264 --> 22:16.433
I... I only ask because it seems to attract

22:16.435 --> 22:18.768
so many different types of people.

22:18.770 --> 22:22.772
I was reading that one person
at the eat-off is a policeman

22:22.774 --> 22:26.843
and one is a realtor.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.212
You all right?

22:28.214 --> 22:30.947
Yes, I'm feeling much better now.

22:30.949 --> 22:32.582
Oh, good.

22:32.584 --> 22:35.652
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

22:35.654 --> 22:37.788
I just asked you what made you choose

22:37.790 --> 22:39.656
competitive eating as a career.

22:39.658 --> 22:43.327
Oh, um, the restaurant...

22:43.329 --> 22:46.363
I hated waiting tables at hated me back.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.865
It's gonna pinch.

22:48.867 --> 22:53.403
I was a terrible waitress. A major klutz.

22:53.405 --> 22:57.073
But then I discovered this talent.

22:57.075 --> 22:59.743
It's a crazy thing to call it,
I know, but,

22:59.745 --> 23:02.546
when you suck at almost all you do,

23:02.548 --> 23:05.181
and then you find something
you're good at,

23:05.183 --> 23:08.151
really good at, it changes everything.

23:08.153 --> 23:10.353
The magical power of food.

23:10.355 --> 23:14.357
There's no escape like a big meal.

23:14.359 --> 23:17.995
You might be right about that.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.297
Your glucose level is fine.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.500
So I can compete.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.035
I have no medical grounds

23:24.037 --> 23:27.206
for pulling you out of the competition.

23:27.208 --> 23:30.243
And I will be there
if you need me for anything.

23:36.484 --> 23:38.785
Voila.

23:38.787 --> 23:40.921
Harborfest comes home.

23:40.923 --> 23:41.922
Wow.

23:41.924 --> 23:43.824
You really are harbor-festive.

23:43.826 --> 23:45.959
There's no escape like a good meal.

23:45.961 --> 23:48.929
I could get used to this.

23:48.931 --> 23:50.398
I think that's a great idea, Evan.

23:50.400 --> 23:54.401
We should make family dinner
a weekly thing.

23:54.403 --> 23:56.236
To Harborfest,

23:56.238 --> 23:58.905
and to family.

24:05.981 --> 24:07.849
Okay, Divya, this is noble of you...

24:07.851 --> 24:10.252
Hank, you know that Evan gets upset

24:10.254 --> 24:11.854
when you dismiss his ideas.

24:11.856 --> 24:15.224
Evan, you know that Hank gets upset

24:15.226 --> 24:18.494
when you push your ideas first,
ask how he feels second,

24:18.496 --> 24:22.198
and ignore how he feels third.

24:22.200 --> 24:23.566
You guys are family,

24:23.568 --> 24:26.769
to each other, and to me.

24:26.771 --> 24:29.939
So I am begging you, please...

24:29.941 --> 24:32.308
Get past the anger
and have a conversation,

24:32.310 --> 24:35.179
like adults.

24:35.181 --> 24:37.948
Okay. Can I start?

24:37.950 --> 24:40.350
Yes, please.

24:40.352 --> 24:42.485
- Henry...
- Evan.

24:42.487 --> 24:47.023
You did dismiss my idea
about embracing technology,

24:47.025 --> 24:49.392
and it did upset me.

24:52.029 --> 24:54.765
To be fair, you can't say
your idea was dismissed,

24:54.767 --> 24:57.634
since you went ahead
and ran with it anyway.

24:57.636 --> 24:58.769
Okay, good, great.

24:58.771 --> 25:00.804
- So, now we can just...
- I'm sorry,

25:00.806 --> 25:03.073
what was my alternative?
Uh, wait a few years

25:03.075 --> 25:04.642
until you gave me your blessing?

25:04.644 --> 25:07.111
I'm ambitious, Hank.
It can be useful at times.

25:07.113 --> 25:08.513
I'm careful.

25:08.515 --> 25:10.915
That can be useful too,
you know, in a medical practice.

25:10.917 --> 25:12.083
Wow, why do you say that like I think

25:12.085 --> 25:13.351
we're running a Hooters franchise?

25:13.353 --> 25:14.852
- Well, if the shoe fits...
- Okay, guys, please.

25:14.854 --> 25:17.689
Honestly, I... Evan, I really
don't think that he meant that.

25:17.691 --> 25:19.691
Yes, Divya, I did.

25:19.693 --> 25:21.359
We focus on people first, profit second.

25:21.361 --> 25:23.195
That's the only type
of Hankmed I'm interested in.

25:23.197 --> 25:24.429
Well, then I guess we're
right back where we started.

25:24.431 --> 25:26.465
- Guys, please...
- You mean back where we ended.

25:26.467 --> 25:28.066
- No. No, no, no... wait...
- There he goes again.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.468
He always needs the last word.

25:29.470 --> 25:31.436
Well, guess what, Henry?
This time, you can have it.

25:31.438 --> 25:33.471
- You can have it.
- Technically, you had it,

25:33.473 --> 25:35.306
since you were just talking, for a change.

25:35.308 --> 25:36.675
- And now you're talking.
- You are!

25:36.677 --> 25:38.010
- You're talking!
- Listen! It's your voice!

25:38.012 --> 25:39.277
- Oh, my God...
- That's all I'm hearing,

25:39.279 --> 25:40.745
- your voice.
- Oh, my God...

25:40.747 --> 25:42.314
listen, what's that sound?
It's Evan talking!

25:42.316 --> 25:43.749
It doesn't even matter!

25:55.096 --> 25:57.196
Mr. Berman stopped by yesterday?

25:57.198 --> 25:58.530
He did.

25:58.532 --> 26:01.366
- Why didn't you tell me?
- When?

26:01.368 --> 26:03.936
Last night, over our quaint
little family dinner?

26:03.938 --> 26:05.271
Whether we're fighting or not,

26:05.273 --> 26:07.307
you have to inform me
when my patient comes...

26:07.309 --> 26:09.175
You mean your patient that I landed?

26:09.177 --> 26:12.546
By bringing his wife tulips and
orchids every day for six weeks

26:12.548 --> 26:14.982
just to secure his business?

26:14.984 --> 26:17.985
Eh, I guess to you that was just
another one of my zany schemes,

26:17.987 --> 26:20.154
- wasn't it?
- Where's his file?

26:22.357 --> 26:25.860
- It's on the table.
- Thank you.

26:30.699 --> 26:33.434
Dude, what are you doing?

26:33.436 --> 26:36.036
What is this?

26:36.038 --> 26:38.338
Private communication between
me and my fiancee.

26:38.340 --> 26:39.572
Yeah, about me.

26:39.574 --> 26:41.040
So?

26:41.042 --> 26:43.509
You want a royalty payment?

26:43.511 --> 26:45.879
How could you call me a quitter?

26:45.881 --> 26:47.414
How could I call you... hm, let's see.

26:47.416 --> 26:49.450
Because you quit.

26:49.452 --> 26:53.722
Things got tough, you walked away.

26:53.724 --> 26:57.960
Guess you got that move from dad.

26:57.962 --> 27:00.763
If that's how you feel,

27:00.765 --> 27:03.466
maybe ending our partnership isn't enough.

27:03.468 --> 27:06.002
Right? I mean...

27:06.004 --> 27:11.073
I can't imagine you want
to live with a quitter.

27:11.075 --> 27:13.475
Guess we've got a lot
to figure out before Monday.

27:13.477 --> 27:17.246
Yeah. I guess we do.

27:29.826 --> 27:31.059
Uh...
[Ahem]

27:31.061 --> 27:32.560
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

27:32.562 --> 27:35.096
My name is Evan R. Lawson,

27:35.098 --> 27:36.298
and I will be your color commentator

27:36.300 --> 27:38.266
for this year's Hamptons
Harborfest eat-off.

27:38.268 --> 27:40.034
[Crowd cheering, applauding]
Which is... yes, that's... yes!

27:40.036 --> 27:41.235
That's good.

27:41.237 --> 27:43.705
Are you guys ready
to meet your contestants?

27:43.707 --> 27:45.974
[Crowd cheering, applauding]

27:45.976 --> 27:47.142
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

27:47.144 --> 27:48.343
Are you ready to meet your contestants?

27:48.345 --> 27:50.613
[Crowd cheering]
Contestants, come on out!

27:50.615 --> 27:52.782
Hey, Divya. Have you seen Ernie around?

27:52.784 --> 27:55.084
No one at the restaurant
knows where he is.

27:58.155 --> 28:00.090
He didn't pull out of the contest?

28:00.092 --> 28:02.892
Well, if he did, he has very good seats.

28:02.894 --> 28:04.661
[Softly] Ernie. Ernie!

28:04.663 --> 28:06.763
Can I talk to you for a second?

28:10.234 --> 28:11.534
I need to do this, Hank.

28:11.536 --> 28:13.769
I thought I specifically
told you not to do this.

28:13.771 --> 28:14.970
Look, everything's changing.

28:14.972 --> 28:16.505
My son's gone, my sister's leaving,

28:16.507 --> 28:18.406
my job's not too far behind.

28:18.408 --> 28:21.809
I've been to every Harborfest
every year since I was born.

28:21.811 --> 28:23.077
And they're gonna change that too.

28:23.079 --> 28:24.946
I need this, Hank.

28:24.948 --> 28:27.983
For my community, yeah,
but more for myself.

28:27.985 --> 28:31.320
This contest has always been won
by a local,

28:31.322 --> 28:33.422
and something around here has got to stay

28:33.424 --> 28:35.959
the way it should be.

28:35.961 --> 28:37.227
Mm-hm?

28:37.229 --> 28:38.495
How much water have you had today?

28:38.497 --> 28:40.964
A glass, with breakfast.

28:43.668 --> 28:45.502
Open your eyes, look over my shoulder.

28:47.805 --> 28:50.040
Okay, now over this shoulder.

28:50.042 --> 28:52.408
Okay.

28:52.410 --> 28:54.844
Deep breath, in and out.

28:57.380 --> 28:59.514
So?

28:59.516 --> 29:01.516
Thanks to the spinal tap,
and the fact that you finally

29:01.518 --> 29:03.084
gave your kidneys a break?

29:03.086 --> 29:04.419
You dodged a bullet, my friend.

29:04.421 --> 29:06.789
All right, so?

29:06.791 --> 29:07.957
Eat your heart out, Mcgillicuddy.

29:07.959 --> 29:10.125
Thanks, doc.

29:10.127 --> 29:12.528
Okay, guys, all right.
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:12.530 --> 29:14.229
the eaters have taken their spots.

29:14.231 --> 29:16.031
Are you guys ready? Thumbs up, please.

29:16.033 --> 29:18.000
Ladies and gentlemen, on the count of

29:18.002 --> 29:20.402
five... four...

29:20.404 --> 29:22.772
three... two...

29:22.774 --> 29:23.839
one...

29:23.841 --> 29:25.674
eat!
[Ding, ding, ding]

29:25.676 --> 29:28.042
They are off, ladies and gentlemen.

29:28.044 --> 29:29.577
Look at them go!

29:29.579 --> 29:31.879
Early on, Rosie "The Ravenous"
is choking down her first one.

29:31.881 --> 29:35.349
"Munchy" Mcgillicuddy already
has two down the hatch.

29:35.351 --> 29:37.485
I'm sensing something
very personal here, guys.

29:37.487 --> 29:39.553
She is chomping them down.

29:39.555 --> 29:41.555
Rosie "The Ravenous" looking very good

29:41.557 --> 29:43.156
at this halfway point.

29:43.158 --> 29:44.458
And, oh, my God,

29:44.460 --> 29:47.661
Jeff "The Vacuum Cleaner"
Darland, slowing down.

29:47.663 --> 29:50.231
Look at Rosie "The Ravenous"
put away number 37.

29:50.233 --> 29:53.267
"Munchy" Mcgillicuddy right behind her.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.803
This is insanity!

29:54.805 --> 29:56.205
It's insanity.

29:56.207 --> 29:59.408
Over here we've got
"The Regurgitator" and T-Bone.

29:59.410 --> 30:02.845
Novak and Mcgillicuddy, near the wire.

30:02.847 --> 30:04.247
Oh, they are looking eyes.

30:04.249 --> 30:05.848
I mean, it's Novak.

30:05.850 --> 30:06.983
It's Mcgillicuddy.

30:06.985 --> 30:08.951
It's Novak again!

30:08.953 --> 30:10.252
And as time expires...
[Ding, ding]

30:10.254 --> 30:12.588
It's a tie!

30:12.590 --> 30:13.722
What?

30:13.724 --> 30:15.357
I don't know what that means,

30:15.359 --> 30:17.259
so I'm gonna go and ask my referees,

30:17.261 --> 30:19.094
'cause I have no idea
what to do right now.

30:21.864 --> 30:25.433
Okay. I've just been informed...

30:25.435 --> 30:26.768
after a short break,

30:26.770 --> 30:31.206
Novak and Mcgillicuddy
will go into sudden death.

30:31.208 --> 30:32.341
[Crowd murmuring]

30:32.343 --> 30:35.644
Which means,
whoever eats five lobster rolls

30:35.646 --> 30:38.647
the fastest will
be crowned Harborfest champ.

30:38.649 --> 30:41.250
Let's just give them a breather right now.

30:41.252 --> 30:42.651
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm just gonna ask you guys.

30:42.653 --> 30:43.819
Who do you think is gonna win this?

30:43.821 --> 30:47.823
Is it gonna be the girl from Grand Rapids?

30:47.825 --> 30:49.925
[Crowd cheering]

30:49.927 --> 30:52.828
Or the boy from Bridgehampton?

30:52.830 --> 30:57.065
[Crowd cheering, applauding]

30:57.067 --> 30:58.132
I'm not sure, it's a little unclear.
