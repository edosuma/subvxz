00:00.709 --> 00:03.128
[moans]

00:12.637 --> 00:15.974
Calzone, eggplant parm,
mushroom pizza. No clams.

00:16.057 --> 00:18.309
Spaghetti, lasagna. No clams.

00:18.393 --> 00:21.104
Going through all these Japopo's receipts
is making me hungry.

00:21.187 --> 00:23.982
-Can we go there tonight?
-They may have killed your mother, so no.

00:24.065 --> 00:25.525
Also, the food's not great.

00:26.484 --> 00:30.071
Hey, if I ask you a boy question,
will you promise not to be weird?

00:30.155 --> 00:32.532
-I promise.
-There's this guy at school, Sven--

00:32.615 --> 00:33.491
You can do better.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.661
Okay, starting now.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.496
He asked me out,
so we're getting coffee today.

00:38.580 --> 00:42.167
Do I tell Eric, who likes me
and may be really hurt?

00:42.250 --> 00:44.377
Or do I not tell him,
which feels like I'm hiding it

00:44.461 --> 00:46.671
because Sven is hot and spent a summer
in Greece playing guitar?

00:47.046 --> 00:48.548
Well, let me ask you a question.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.217
Does Sven know your mother and I
are constantly looking for people to kill?

00:51.301 --> 00:52.343
Dad.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.722
Okay. Eric is your friend,
and it's gonna hurt him a lot more

00:55.805 --> 00:58.099
if he finds out from someone else,
so you should tell him.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.769
Thanks, Dad. That was
uncharacteristically good parenting.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.604
Couldn't just let me have
the straight win, huh?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.397
I feel like I gave you enough.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.942
Hi, guys.
How's it going with the receipts?

01:08.026 --> 01:12.280
This is the final one.
And it's... chicken piccata.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.532
Someone didn't read my first Yelp review.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.077
"If you like capers,
try a Marx Brothers movie

01:17.160 --> 01:19.913
because you won't find any
in this piccata!"

01:24.292 --> 01:25.126
Okay.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.922
So, the night we ate at Japopo's,
clams was a special,

01:29.005 --> 01:30.340
and only three people ordered them.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.593
You, Ramona, and a guy named Ed Thune.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.887
Colonel Ed Thune. We Googled him.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.555
He's single, retired,

01:37.639 --> 01:40.809
and he thinks that a profile picture
is literally a profile.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.603
If he's undead, the clams are definitely
the source of this thing.

01:43.686 --> 01:46.648
You and Ramona could be a coincidence,
but three people is a pattern.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.818
Way to go, you guys. This is huge!

01:49.901 --> 01:53.238
If we know it's the clams,
<i>we</i> can stop it from spreading.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.198
We could literally save the world!

01:55.281 --> 01:56.866
It's all up to us!

01:56.950 --> 01:59.119
-Then let's go find Ed Thune!
-Ooh!

01:59.202 --> 02:02.330
-Today's not good.
-What? Honey, it's the world.

02:02.413 --> 02:05.458
We have that meeting with Carl,
and then we're pitching to that investor.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.417
Yeah, but...

02:07.544 --> 02:10.296
-The world!
-Dad's right. What could possibly

02:10.380 --> 02:12.215
-be more important than saving the--
-[ringtone playing]

02:12.298 --> 02:15.260
Holy shit, it's Sven!
Hey, how was paddle boarding?

02:15.343 --> 02:16.177
Who's Sven?

02:16.261 --> 02:18.096
Just a boy who's gonna break Eric's heart.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.473
I really think we should talk
to Ed Thune today.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.517
We absolutely should, tomorrow,

02:22.600 --> 02:24.769
because if we don't make
that meeting today,

02:24.853 --> 02:27.147
Carl's gonna take us off
the biggest project of our lives.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.024
But if Ed is feral
and infecting people today,

02:30.108 --> 02:31.693
what good is a housing development

02:31.776 --> 02:34.654
when rabid armies of flesh-eating goons
are roamin' the streets?

02:34.737 --> 02:38.074
-We both have really good arguments.
-I don't think we both do.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.659
Okay, how about this?

02:39.742 --> 02:43.329
You go talk to Ed. And if he's undead,
we know it's the clams.

02:43.746 --> 02:47.500
And if he's feral, we go back together
and make him regular dead.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.128
In the meantime,
I'm gonna take that meeting with Carl.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.673
Speaking of making people dead, you
should not go talk to Carl by yourself.

02:53.756 --> 02:55.341
Don't worry, I have a plan.

02:55.425 --> 02:59.512
I'm just gonna act like old Sheila,
who's demure and chipper

02:59.596 --> 03:02.432
and never had an orgasm
while eating a man's liver.

03:03.057 --> 03:03.975
[moans]

03:04.809 --> 03:07.437
Judging by your look,
I haven't mentioned that before.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.024
No, you have.
I just never know what to say.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.409
You think you can even act
like the old Sheila around Carl?

03:21.492 --> 03:23.620
I think so, but maybe you're right.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.788
Maybe it's too dangerous,
and I shouldn't go.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.082
-I really think that's best.
-Fooled you, motherfucka.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.877
That was the old, agreeable Sheila.
I'm gonna nail this.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.171
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Anne.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.632
Hey, uh, Joel,
you're a pretty good dancer, right?

03:36.090 --> 03:38.343
-No. Who told you that?
-You did.

03:38.968 --> 03:42.096
Remember, honey, that's why you trashed
Principal Novak's house,

03:42.180 --> 03:44.474
is because you were giving
his grandmother dancing lessons.

03:44.557 --> 03:48.645
Of course. I was confused because you
asked me if I was a pretty good dancer,

03:48.728 --> 03:49.646
which I'm not.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.606
I'm an outstanding dancer.

03:52.023 --> 03:56.027
Salsa, tango, numerous others that I know.

03:56.444 --> 03:59.239
Perfect! Lisa's birthday's coming up,
and I wanna take her dancing.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.449
She loves the tango,
but I don't know the first thing about it.

04:01.532 --> 04:02.575
Can you teach me?

04:03.284 --> 04:05.286
The thing is, I'm a little busy.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.081
-Yeah, he's really busy.
-Yeah.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.502
-Are you sure?
-Uh-huh.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.422
I could do it anytime,
work around your schedule.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.886
-Okay.
-Great. How's tonight at 6:00?

04:23.346 --> 04:25.265
-Okay.
-I have Bible study at 9:00.

04:25.348 --> 04:28.810
-Is three hours enough time?
-Okay.

04:29.227 --> 04:32.021
Perfect. I'll see you tonight.
Bye, Sheila.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.356
Bye, Anne.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.528
-What the fuck?
-She makes me nervous.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.572
You said you were busy,
and I backed you up.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.074
All you had to do was stick with that.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.326
I'm worried about you talking
to Ed Thune without me.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.080
He's a colonel, and as you just
demonstrated with Deputy Garcia,

04:49.163 --> 04:50.290
you're not good with authority.

04:50.873 --> 04:52.792
I think it's because you have
a cold, dominating dad.

04:53.459 --> 04:56.462
-Can we leave Father out of this?
-The way you froze with Anne?

04:56.546 --> 04:58.923
If you do that with Colonel Thune
and he's gone feral,

04:59.007 --> 05:00.967
you're gonna end up wearing
your intestines as a necklace.

05:02.343 --> 05:05.430
Fine. I'll just stake the place out,
see what I can learn.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.266
I promise I'll be the coward
you want me to be.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.309
Thank you.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.146
-Have a good day.
-You too. Don't kill Carl.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.023
Okay. Don't get killed by Ed.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.107
-Okay.
-Okay.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.403
[Eric] Okay. Here is the satellite image
of the fracking site.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.990
I think that that blurry thing
might be a construction trailer.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.952
Or a shoebox.
I'm having trouble with the scale.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.706
Well, that's a field... or gravy.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.375
Maybe we should bring biscuits
just to be safe.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.211
It's gonna be hard shutting down
a fracking site

05:37.295 --> 05:38.671
if we don't know what's there.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.089
We need better pictures.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.050
We can't just go in there.
They'll see us.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.011
-Do you know what a ghillie suit is?
-Assume I don't.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.805
It's a camouflage outfit
that snipers make from local flora,

05:47.889 --> 05:50.099
which enables them to disappear
into their surroundings.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.686
If you have a couple extra hours this
afternoon, we can gather dirt and leaves--

05:53.770 --> 05:55.646
I have a date today.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.567
-What?
-Sorry. That was the wrong way to do that.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.779
I thought it would be better if you
found out from me than someone else.

06:02.862 --> 06:07.408
-There's this guy, Sven.
-Cool. Cool.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.994
Do you mean handsome Sven
who was on <i>Good Morning America</i>

06:10.078 --> 06:12.163
after he saved his little brother
from a shark attack?

06:12.246 --> 06:14.999
Or another totally non-threatening Sven
who I've never met or heard of?

06:15.458 --> 06:17.335
-This is weird for you.
-Totally not weird.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.712
Heard the shark
wasn't even that big, so...

06:19.796 --> 06:23.925
You sure you're okay with it?
'Cause, you know, if you're not,

06:25.259 --> 06:28.805
then... I could...

06:32.308 --> 06:34.811
Okay, thought you were gonna jump
in there, but I am going out with him.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.020
And you should, 100 percent.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.649
You were happy for me when I went out
with Ramona, so I'm happy for you.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.150
Because if life has taught me anything,

06:41.234 --> 06:43.528
it's that human emotion
is all about fairness.

06:44.362 --> 06:47.240
Well, thank you for trying
and failing to be cool.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.617
That's kinda my jiggity jam.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.091
Good morning, Carl.
I stopped on the way and got your coffee.

07:05.174 --> 07:06.425
Oh, give it to me.

07:06.884 --> 07:11.139
I also picked up some of those Danishes
your doctor doesn't let you have.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.517
Oh, you are bad.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.437
Mm. Mm. Oh.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.022
So good. Come on, let's be bad together.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.443
Oh, I can't. I'm on a new diet.
I can only eat meat.

07:23.818 --> 07:28.990
-That's stupid. Come on, have one.
-I will literally throw up on you.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.744
Fine. Fuck me for being generous.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.331
All right, well, the investor's
gonna be here this afternoon

07:37.415 --> 07:39.792
to hear the concepts
for the first six houses.

07:40.084 --> 07:43.171
Yeah, I know, Carl.
You're reading off a memo I wrote to you.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.424
Whoa! You're rough in the morning.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.509
Have a lamb chop or somethin'.

07:48.593 --> 07:51.512
Nobody is stealing your memo byline, okay?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.390
-Anyway...
-"Anyhoo."

07:56.809 --> 07:59.061
I like it when girls say "anyhoo."
It's cute.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.815
-Um, anyhoo...
-Better!

08:02.899 --> 08:04.734
Um, I've been doing some research,

08:04.817 --> 08:07.737
and I thought that maybe
we could design these homes

08:07.820 --> 08:11.782
with a more sustainable approach
than we typically see in Santa Clarita.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.327
There's this article in the<i> New York Times</i>
about smart homes.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.995
I'm gonna stop you right there.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.331
People don't give a shit
about sustainability.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.041
They want big beige boxes.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.003
Actually, according to this study,
many new home buyers--

08:24.086 --> 08:25.254
Sheila.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.464
Mm-mm?

08:29.592 --> 08:32.303
Big beige boxes is how we make money.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.930
Now, if you wanna be part of that,

08:34.013 --> 08:38.059
your job is to smile
and back up everything I say.

08:38.142 --> 08:38.976
Understand?

08:39.852 --> 08:40.686
Absolutely.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.522
Well, then let's see the smile.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.151
Come on, bigger.

08:49.153 --> 08:49.987
More teeth.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.115
That's better.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.495
Oh, Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is wrong with your eye?

08:58.329 --> 08:59.163
Oh, shit!

09:10.633 --> 09:13.803
[tango music playing]

09:41.539 --> 09:43.165
Well, that told me nothing.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.084
Fuck it.

09:54.010 --> 09:54.885
[knocking]

10:00.891 --> 10:02.685
-Yes?
-Good morning.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.353
I'm Martin L. Taylor, Esquire,

10:04.437 --> 10:07.523
and I'm putting together a lawsuit
against a local eatery, Japopo's.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.983
If you've eaten there recently,

10:09.066 --> 10:11.777
you may be entitled to a share
of a very large settlement.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.572
Sorry, son, I've never been there.
Now, if you'll excuse me--

10:14.655 --> 10:16.032
You are Ed Thune, right?

10:17.825 --> 10:20.161
-Colonel Ed Thune.
-It's just...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.417
This is your receipt, isn't it, Colonel?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.966
Oh, Japopo's. [chuckles]

10:34.050 --> 10:38.512
Yeah, the Italian place on Soledad.
I'd completely forgotten.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.765
If I could just ask you a few questions...

10:41.182 --> 10:44.018
Of course, Martin. Come on in.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.898
I wouldn't want to impose.
We can just talk here.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.984
Nonsense.
You're letting all the cold air out.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.736
Come inside.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.073
Okay.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.037
You're not deteriorating.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.498
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, your blood--

11:05.581 --> 11:08.459
Technically, your black goo hasn't changed
since we gave you the serum.

11:08.542 --> 11:09.377
May I?

11:09.460 --> 11:11.379
[sighs] Well, that's a relief.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.256
Looks like you got the eye back in okay.
That's good.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.718
Eh...

11:18.302 --> 11:19.136
Except...

11:20.513 --> 11:22.139
I got your nose.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.937
If I'm not deteriorating,
then why did my eye get weird?

11:28.020 --> 11:30.439
Well, I noticed
you've been biting your nails.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.691
-Are you under stress?
-A little.

11:32.775 --> 11:36.529
I'm working on a project with my boss,
and he doesn't like the newer, bolder me.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.739
So, I'm trying to act like old Sheila,

11:38.823 --> 11:42.952
when, really, all I wanna do is
snap off his jaw and feed him his balls.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.956
Well, like any of us,
when you bottle up your feelings,

11:47.039 --> 11:48.374
they come out in other ways.

11:48.457 --> 11:51.919
For some, it's hives or panic attacks
or getting shingles so young,

11:52.002 --> 11:54.839
your doctor wants to send you to Virginia
for a special study.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.884
-Maybe you should quit the project.
-I can't.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.386
Why not? It's only money.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.430
And everyone with money
says money's not important.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.223
It's more than that.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.476
If I can't control my emotions,
then I can't function in the world.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.146
And I don't wanna go through life
only being undead.

12:11.355 --> 12:14.650
I understand. It's like that billboard
with the old guy riding a bike that says,

12:14.733 --> 12:16.569
"I am more
than my irritable bowel syndrome."

12:17.445 --> 12:18.320
Yeah, kind of.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.072
We thought my grandma had irritable bowel.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.868
Turns out she was just what
her pharmacist called a "grumpy pooper."

12:24.452 --> 12:26.912
Eric, I adore you, but this isn't helping.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.123
-Okay.
-I'm just gonna have to suck it up.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.460
That's what people do at work
all the time.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.337
Just tell me
that it isn't gonna get worse.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.299
Oh, it'll probably get a lot worse.

12:38.382 --> 12:42.052
For all we know, your eye could pop out
and, well, take somebody's eye out.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.263
This is a complicated medical condition.

12:44.346 --> 12:48.184
Maybe I will style my hair differently
so no one will see.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.273
Yeah. That might work.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.985
Wandering around Greece
playing my guitar was like a dream.

12:58.944 --> 13:03.240
After a month, I woke up, and I realized
I'd travelled halfway around the world,

13:03.824 --> 13:05.826
and I'd taken all my problems with me.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.078
Yeah, wherever you go, there you are.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.914
Yeah. So, I went home.

13:10.915 --> 13:13.542
I'd also left my guitar on a train
after an old lady got me drunk on ouzo.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.503
[chuckles]

13:15.878 --> 13:18.297
Right, but now I'm just the guy
who talks about himself.

13:18.714 --> 13:22.968
So, Abby Hammond, what is your deal?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.931
Well, let's see. What can I tell you?

13:27.473 --> 13:29.642
What can I tell you?

13:30.476 --> 13:31.769
My parents are realtors.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.231
A co-worker of theirs was staying
in our basement for a while.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.525
He was a handful. And...

13:37.608 --> 13:39.109
oh, here's something I just found out.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.986
I'm really boring on dates.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.404
You're not boring.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.282
You hit Christian in the face
with a frickin' lunch tray.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.160
The girl who did that has a story to tell.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.663
Yeah, she does.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.790
Okay, then tell it. I wanna hear it.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.503
Well, at first, I was just upset.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.547
I saw what he did to Janie

13:59.630 --> 14:01.590
and that no one else
was gonna do anything.

14:01.674 --> 14:06.470
And then it's like I felt
this quiet, overwhelming rage.

14:07.721 --> 14:11.100
It was so strong, I picked that lunch tray
up without even feeling it.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.603
I just kept thinking about Janie
and about all the other girls

14:14.687 --> 14:16.689
Christian was gonna dick over
in the future, and...

14:17.565 --> 14:21.402
the next thing I remember is the sound
of the hard plastic hitting his face.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.029
That's when I got scared.

14:24.113 --> 14:28.534
Not scared that I'd done anything wrong,
but scared how good it felt to hurt him.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.371
Jesus.

14:35.666 --> 14:39.253
Anyway, that's me. What've you been up to
since you got back from Greece?

14:39.336 --> 14:42.423
Um, uh, I don't know.
I like to play soccer.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.258
Um, photography.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.803
-I like to paddle board.
-Photography? Do you have a good camera?

14:49.096 --> 14:53.267
So, Japopo's was selling bad clams.
That's terrible.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.852
-Yeah.
-Is everyone all right?

14:55.102 --> 14:56.645
Some people got pretty sick.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.440
Really? How sick? Did they vomit?

14:59.648 --> 15:01.901
Yes, they did, Ed. Why? Did you?

15:01.984 --> 15:05.988
No. Thank God. I hate food poisoning.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.908
Good thing
I didn't have the clams, Martin.

15:09.199 --> 15:13.037
-You didn't? Are you sure?
-Positive. I'm a vegan.

15:14.288 --> 15:18.167
It's just strange because the receipt says
you did have the clams.

15:21.378 --> 15:23.714
My date must've had the clams.
I had a salad.

15:24.131 --> 15:28.844
-Oh. You were on a date?
-Yes, Martin. People my age date.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.305
Of course. Right on.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.682
So, did your date get sick?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.393
I don't know.
I haven't heard from her since that night.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.939
There was no... connection.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.817
-So, do you know where she is now?
-Barbara?

15:45.277 --> 15:48.781
I have her phone number written
on a post-it out in the kitchen.

15:48.864 --> 15:51.742
Why don't you come with me
and we can chat some more?

15:52.701 --> 15:56.121
The kitchen is just right here,
behind this door.

15:57.539 --> 16:01.085
No. I'll stay here and enjoy your clocks.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.880
Are you sure? I just made some Danish.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.551
I used fresh apples from the tree
in my backyard. It's delicious.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.387
You can eat Danish?

16:11.470 --> 16:15.683
I'm a vegan, not a monster.
Of course I eat Danish. [chuckles]

16:17.518 --> 16:21.814
I would like to see that Danish
and eat it, together.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.734
Weird way of saying that, but okay.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.488
Barbara's number is here someplace.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.533
So, how about that pastry?

16:32.616 --> 16:33.951
Somebody's hungry.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.328
It's right there on the table.
Help yourself.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.916
-Hey, Ed, what's with the tarps?
-Oh.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.752
Pardon the mess. I'm painting.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.963
-I don't see any paint.
-Haven't bought the paint.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.632
-But you bought the tarps?
-They didn't have the color I wanted.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.052
Is that okay with you,
guy who just walked into my house?

16:52.136 --> 16:54.847
I just wanna eat Danish with you.
Why can't we eat Danish together?

16:54.930 --> 16:58.225
You said Barbara might be sick.
I want to get you her number.

16:58.308 --> 17:00.769
I'll bet you it's in the basement.
Let's go to my basement.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.187
I'm not going to your basement.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.817
I have a problem with stairs.
Extreme vertigo.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.236
I faint if I look directly
into the washing machine.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.197
I get it.

17:13.782 --> 17:16.869
"Let's go to my basement"
did sound kinda creepy.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.413
It's just... that's where my office is.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.915
I just redid it.
You should come take a look.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.003
I'm doing it again. I'll be right back.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.004
Find anything interesting?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.800
So, this development is more upscale,

18:12.883 --> 18:15.219
but, I mean, there's no reason
to reinvent the wheel.

18:15.803 --> 18:20.099
Exactly. Why would anyone want
to reinvent the wheel? So smart!

18:20.724 --> 18:23.352
So, we just build the houses
that we know people like.

18:23.435 --> 18:26.396
We just build them bigger.
It means more profits.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.316
Money, money, money, money, money!
It's what makes the world go round.

18:29.399 --> 18:32.611
Like a wheel. Why reinvent it?
Anyhoo, Carl?

18:32.694 --> 18:35.030
Thanks, Sheila.
I love the hair, by the way.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.366
You look like an attainable
Jessica Rabbit.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.620
Wow! You really have a way with words...
and houses.

18:42.287 --> 18:43.122
Carl.

18:43.205 --> 18:47.167
Wait. So, your plan is to just build
the same thing but bigger?

18:47.793 --> 18:50.087
You get it. Todd gets it.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.880
-So smart.
-[Todd] I don't know.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.175
I was hoping for something
more forward-thinking, disruptive.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.135
Like Uber.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.804
But, it's a house.

19:00.180 --> 19:01.014
[phone dings]

19:02.891 --> 19:07.437
We have another eco-friendly idea
that you might be uber interested in.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.314
Great. Love to hear it,
but give me a minute.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.691
My brother's contesting the will.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.200
-What was that, Sheila?
-I don't know. Sounds like someone died,

19:20.284 --> 19:23.120
and his brother wants more money
than Todd feels he's entitled to.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.582
No, I mean why the fuck
did you say that you had another idea?

19:26.665 --> 19:30.085
Because we're losing him, Carl.
He wants something different.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.962
I don't care what he wants.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.590
Your only job here is to support me.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.801
If you can't do that, then go on back
to the kiddie pool. You understand?

19:38.468 --> 19:39.303
[sighs]

19:40.304 --> 19:41.722
Yes, Carl.

19:41.805 --> 19:45.434
We are a team, Sheila,
and there is no "I" in "team."

19:45.517 --> 19:49.062
There is a "me" and a "mate"
and a "meat."

19:49.146 --> 19:53.650
And "tame" and "eat" and "mat."

19:54.818 --> 19:55.861
Are you following me?

19:56.320 --> 20:01.283
See, because I see things from all angles.
That's why I am in charge.

20:01.366 --> 20:05.996
So, tame your meat
and be a teammate to me.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.081
Okay.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.501
-There he is! Hey, Todd.
-Sorry about that.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.963
My brother and my father's nurse think
they're smarter than me.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.298
And they're not.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.051
-[chuckles]
-Oh. Well, jumping back in--

20:19.134 --> 20:21.553
Hang on. Sheila, didn't you say
you had a different take?

20:23.889 --> 20:25.849
I think Carl's idea is the way to go.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.394
Because I read something about millennials
wanting eco-friendly homes.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.605
-Is that what you were talking about?
-Nuh-uh.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.565
Are you sure? It sounded like it was.

20:34.066 --> 20:34.900
No.

20:35.817 --> 20:39.571
See, sales and marketing
is really Sheila's forte.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.699
You really can't listen to her
when she starts spouting off

20:42.783 --> 20:44.493
about the big picture stuff.

Todd, step over here to the easel.
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.833
Look at that master bathroom.
You could wash a car in that thing.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.836
What people want is space, luxury.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.173
I've been in this business a lot longer
than Sheila, and I know what sells.

20:58.257 --> 21:02.803
Trust me, bigger is better.
And forget Sheila and her eco bullshit.

to put on my Danish.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.066
Here's Barbara's number.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.070
Turns out it was next to the phone,
and I think you should leave.

21:20.862 --> 21:24.449
-But we haven't had our Danish.
-You can take your Danish to go, son.

21:25.826 --> 21:26.660
Oh.

21:28.912 --> 21:34.293
Actually, I would really like us
to eat it together.

21:35.877 --> 21:37.671
Is that necessary?

21:37.754 --> 21:40.340
Yes. Danish is a treat.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.050
It's no fun eating it alone.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.430
Okay, Martin.

Damn, that's good.

Listen, Colonel. I'm sorry about all this.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.123
I'll get out of your hair.
Thanks for Barbara's number.

He has this really fancy camera,
so we didn't need to get too close.

25:27.317 --> 25:30.278
The guards thought we were just teenagers
taking pictures of each other, you know,

25:30.362 --> 25:32.530
before we banged it out
on the hood of his Mazda.

25:32.614 --> 25:36.201
-What? Oh, okay. Payback.
-Mm-hm.

25:36.284 --> 25:39.204
Anyway, look at this fence.
Right there, there's a tree.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.374
You could easily throw a blanket
on that barbed wire, and we're in.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.210
And this billboard can be seen
from the highway.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.461
That's where we make our statement.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.464
Wow. We're really gonna do this?

25:49.756 --> 25:50.757
I want to do it.

25:51.925 --> 25:53.969
-Are you in?
-I am in.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.556
Huh, this is the exact conversation
I had with Sven on the hood of his car.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.059
Okay, you know what?
You are a guest in my room.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.146
Sheila?

26:06.314 --> 26:08.608
I found the guy, and it <i>was</i> the clams!

26:09.109 --> 26:12.279
-Oh, look who's here.
-Anne came for her dance lesson.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.155
So, that should be fun.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.575
What were you saying about clams, Joel?
You seemed pretty agitated.

26:19.202 --> 26:23.832
Anne, I was discussing
a private seafood matter with my wife.

26:23.915 --> 26:27.210
-Do you have a problem with that?
-No, it just sounded strange--

26:27.294 --> 26:29.170
Great. That's settled.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.172
Now, you want me to teach you
how to tango?

26:31.840 --> 26:33.049
Here's how I tango.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.929
These moves may be unorthodox...

26:41.016 --> 26:42.309
but, on the dance floor...

26:44.185 --> 26:46.646
the only authority I bow to...

26:49.065 --> 26:50.108
is rhythm.

27:00.618 --> 27:01.870
Tango.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.874
Lisa also wanted a blender
for her birthday,

27:05.957 --> 27:07.584
so I'm just gonna get her that.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.253
-Good night, Sheila.
-Bye, Anne.

27:11.921 --> 27:14.257
I recommend the Vitamix.
Cuts through anything.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.134
You can liquefy a golf ball.

27:18.386 --> 27:20.889
-[door opens, closes]
-So...

27:21.514 --> 27:24.267
I know you told me
not to confront Ed, but I did,

27:24.351 --> 27:27.395
and he was undead and he attacked me,
but I held my ground.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.231
And I killed him.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.817
Then I threw his body in the trunk,
drove it out to the desert,

27:32.901 --> 27:36.071
and buried him,
but now we know it is the clams.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.948
We just have to find
Japopo's seafood distributor,

27:39.032 --> 27:40.784
and maybe we can stop this thing.

27:41.451 --> 27:42.494
That's great, honey.

27:43.912 --> 27:44.871
Are you okay?

27:45.747 --> 27:48.208
Being undead
and having a successful career

27:48.291 --> 27:50.293
is going to be more challenging
than I thought.

27:50.377 --> 27:53.630
-I had a little incident.
-Oh, no. Did you attack someone?

27:54.047 --> 27:54.881
Kind of.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.634
Me.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.010
Fuck.
