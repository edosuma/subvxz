00:14.400 --> 00:17.040
The Americans have been able
to shut down most of the reactors.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.560
I'll have to manage the override personally.
Make sure those six melt down on schedule.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.120
Is there anything I can do?

00:23.200 --> 00:24.760
Take care of your mess.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.960
I give you my word. My wife and son
will be dead by the end of this day.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.120
- I'm not afraid of Father.
- You should be.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.160
He tried to kill me,
and then he did this to you.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.240
You're going to need
to set things up on your end.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.720
All right. What do I do?

00:39.800 --> 00:41.960
Divert suspicion.

00:42.040 --> 00:46.600
Someone inside CTU is leaking information
to someone on the outside.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.840
Ms Driscoll, what's going on?

00:48.920 --> 00:51.480
- You're under arrest, Gavin.
- For what?

00:51.560 --> 00:54.760
You've been passing classified information.

00:56.480 --> 01:01.120
Thousands of lives are at stake. Where
are the people who control the override?

01:01.200 --> 01:03.600
I swear I don't know anything.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.320
- Yeah?
- " We've got a match, Jack."

01:06.400 --> 01:08.240
His name is Henry Powell.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.360
He was a computer consultant
for McLennan-Forster.

01:11.440 --> 01:15.080
They designed the device
controlling the power plants.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.680
You're going to fly me out of here.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.680
Drop the weapon now! Now!

01:22.080 --> 01:24.040
Put him in the back.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.040
He's dead, Jack.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.200
Dammit!

01:35.600 --> 01:38.400
You got the wrong one.
Sarah's not guilty.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.720
It's Marianne Taylor.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.760
You're under arrest.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.280
- Excuse me, Curtis.
- Not now.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.360
All right.

02:12.080 --> 02:16.200
Coordinate that with NRC.
Copy me on six-zero-Baker. Fine.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.920
- I warned you about her.
- What are you talking about?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.040
Marianne Taylor.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.200
I said she was trouble and it was
a mistake to let her work here.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.960
You said you weren't
comfortable working with her.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.120
You didn't say you were
having a relationship with a spy.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.920
How could I have known?
Don't play that card with me.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.920
Fine. Then don't have
an "I told you so" attitude.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.520
- Now we both have to deal with this.
- Division?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.840
That's right.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.280
They're gonna want a timeline -
from how Marianne got in here,

02:45.360 --> 02:51.360
down to the high-security files that she was
able to access in a very short period of time.

02:53.120 --> 02:57.200
- Can we have a conversation off-book?
- Go ahead.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.440
Neither of us should compromise
our authority with Division.

03:00.520 --> 03:02.520
- Agree or disagree?
- Agreed.

03:03.640 --> 03:06.800
Marianne did an excellent job
in establishing her credentials.

03:06.880 --> 03:11.640
All we need to do is leave out some of the
details in how she managed to get in here.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.200
I don't like anyone
holding something over me.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.560
Neither do I.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.200
How long will it take you to adjust the files?

03:28.280 --> 03:30.480
Two minutes.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.440
I'll call Division in five.

03:44.560 --> 03:49.560
Explain to me how this mole, Marianne
Taylor, was able to infiltrate CTU.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.280
- We're still investigating.
- Who does she work for?

03:52.360 --> 03:54.240
- We don't know.
- Find out.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.080
We will, as soon as she's conscious.
She's being treated here.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.840
- "Treated for what?"
- An attempt on her life.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.160
- Who tried to kill her?
- We don't know that either.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.800
But whoever it was, they're more than likely
connected with the theft of the override.

04:08.880 --> 04:12.560
Jim, we need to find that override now.
What's the latest from the NRC?

04:12.640 --> 04:16.399
They reported the San Gabriel Island
reactor's about to go critical.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.720
What's the time frame?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.399
Meltdown within the hour.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.840
We're evacuating the San Gabriel zone.

04:22.920 --> 04:27.960
The population affected is less than 100,000.
Hopefully, most are already on the move.

04:28.040 --> 04:31.600
All right. Expedite the process
as much as you can.

04:31.680 --> 04:32.920
Yes, sir.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.640
Jack?

04:39.720 --> 04:43.000
Erin, Powell's dead. He was hit
by a sniper when we arrested him.

04:43.080 --> 04:47.800
- "Get anything from him before he was killed?"
- No. But I got his last ten cellphone calls.

04:47.880 --> 04:52.480
He called two numbers repeatedly.
We traced one of them to Marianne Taylor.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.040
- Powell was working with Marianne?
- Apparently.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.320
- What about this other number?
- Hold on.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.560
- I'm gonna need you to trace it through CTU.
- OK. Go ahead.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.400
818-555-0539.

05:04.480 --> 05:09.480
- I'll get back to you as soon as I've got an ID.
- I'll be standing by.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.600
Edgar?

05:12.680 --> 05:15.960
I need you to run a locate on this number.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.000
- It's a cellular account.
- Location?

05:21.080 --> 05:22.320
- I need to ping the number.
- How?

05:22.400 --> 05:24.960
It has to ring at least four times
for triangulation.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.880
Jameson can have me set up
in a couple of minutes.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.840
- " Who is it?
- Navi.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.720
Navi?

05:47.760 --> 05:50.000
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Dina.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.280
- Why would Dina be here?
- She hasn't called in the last hour?

05:53.360 --> 05:54.560
No.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.200
What's going on, Navi?

05:57.280 --> 05:59.880
- Why are you blocking the door?
- I'm not.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.200
Let me in.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.120
- She's not here.
- You're lying. You're hiding her.

06:05.200 --> 06:09.480
No, I'm not. Navi, no!
You have no right to come in here like this.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.840
She is not here.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.920
Look.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.720
That is my bedroom.
You can't go in there!

06:22.680 --> 06:25.040
- What's going on here?
- Nothing. It's OK.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.400
Navi, please. Please go.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.400
This is none of your business.
Why don't you hike it on out?

06:30.480 --> 06:32.160
Please, don't interfere.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.920
You can either walk out of here
or I'm gonna throw you out.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.320
- I said go!
- No, Navi. Please, no!

06:40.480 --> 06:41.800
Navi,

06:41.880 --> 06:43.880
don't, please.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.200
Get back inside.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.840
Navi.

07:02.920 --> 07:06.480
Don't tell my husband, I beg of you.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.200
You disgust me.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.080
Navi...

07:18.560 --> 07:20.920
Dina's not here.
What about the hospitals?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.640
- " Nothing so far."
- Keep looking.

07:49.080 --> 07:52.320
- " Is it your father?
- I can't tell.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.320
Don't answer it.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.360
- We got it.
- Where?

08:02.440 --> 08:05.520
- A hotel in Chatsworth.
- Download the coordinates to Jack.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.720
Here's the backup.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.600
- Yeah.
- " We've traced the call."

08:12.680 --> 08:15.160
Hold on a second.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.880
- I got it. We're less than ten minutes out.
- "I'll have a tactical team in place."

08:19.960 --> 08:21.520
Thank you.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.680
The body's by my car.
He was taken out by a sniper from the roof.

08:24.760 --> 08:29.080
I want you to take your photographs,
get the body back to CTU as fast as possible.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.799
- Come on, Tony. We gotta go.
- Wait, Jack.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.919
- Look, I think I'm done here today.
- What are you talking about?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.880
CTU backup's here.
You don't need me any more.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.360
I need you to see this through with me.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.040
I appreciate that,
but you don't have to prop up my ego.

08:45.120 --> 08:46.400
This isn't about you.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.600
If we don't find the override device in
an hour, we'll have six nuclear disasters.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.080
So please, get in the car. Let's go.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.080
Mom, we've got to get you some help.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.920
I'm OK.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.360
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.880
Your father shot me, not you.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.520
Because you were trying
to stop him from killing me.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.480
Everything that's happening today,

09:42.400 --> 09:46.160
what we've all been fighting to achieve,

09:46.240 --> 09:49.600
it's more important to him than anything,

09:49.680 --> 09:52.240
or anyone.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.280
But not to you.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.200
Mom?

10:10.480 --> 10:15.000
- I need to get you something for the pain.
- I'll be fine. I just need to rest.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.280
- I can get it from Naseem.
- No.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.400
The hospital he works at is near here.
I'll be right back.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.480
Naseem doesn't know
why we were really living here.

10:23.560 --> 10:27.480
Mom, he's your brother.
I'll tell him you need it, and nothing else.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.760
I promise. I'll be right back.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.840
- Just hurry.
- I will.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.560
Mr Secretary.

10:45.640 --> 10:49.640
We have a meltdown. San Gabriel Island
reactor's just gone critical.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.960
- Core material is now airborne.
- I thought we had more time.

10:53.040 --> 10:57.560
Ms Driscoll, Derek Rosner, the engineer
at San Gabriel Island, is on with the NRC.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.880
One of their generators exploded,
cooked their comm lines.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.640
- We may only have a few seconds.
- Patch us in.

11:03.720 --> 11:08.280
- What's going on?
- We've had a meltdown in San Gabriel Island.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.120
All attempts to contain the core failed.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.920
We're trying to bypass the reactor trip,
but that's not working.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.840
Mr Rosner, this is Erin Driscoll from CTU.
Can you hear me?

11:18.920 --> 11:20.000
Yes, ma'am.

11:20.080 --> 11:24.080
Secretary of Defense James Heller is here.
What are your radiation levels?

11:24.160 --> 11:27.400
We're at... 500 REM right now.

11:27.480 --> 11:31.080
That's ten thousand times
the dose of an x-ray.

11:31.160 --> 11:34.000
At this REM rate the radiation will get stronger

11:34.080 --> 11:37.320
and will spill into the atmosphere
until the core is exhausted.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.760
Son, you've done everything you can,
now get out of there.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.600
Evacuating won't make any difference, sir.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.320
We've already been exposed.

11:46.840 --> 11:49.720
" We've lost them.
Can we re-establish the link?

12:06.440 --> 12:08.760
Have we analysed the cloud's movement?

12:08.840 --> 12:11.360
We're waiting for NGS
to get a satellite refresh.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.800
- Get on the phone, have them expedite.
- I will.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.120
After rerouting evacuation instructions.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.560
- Can't someone else do that?
- No. We're short of manpower.

12:22.640 --> 12:27.280
A government spokesman has confirmed
that the nuclear reactor at San Gabriel Island

12:27.360 --> 12:30.280
is in full meltdown.
Emergency personnel are on site,

12:30.360 --> 12:35.080
attempting to rescue
workers exposed to radiation.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.800
You're not listening.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.440
I've been trying to get through to
the evacuation zone for ten minutes.

12:40.520 --> 12:44.520
I need you to link me in to access
the emergency bandwidth. I need it now.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.360
- " All right. Stand by."
- Thank you.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.040
If you are on the road or awaiting

12:52.560 --> 12:56.160
here are some items
you and your family might need.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.760
- Hello?
- " Mom."

12:57.840 --> 12:59.080
Hello, Edgar.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.600
- Have you seen the news?
- I'm watching it now.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.040
Why aren't you evacuated by now?

13:04.120 --> 13:06.800
- You know I don't have a car.
- Where's Margaret?

13:06.880 --> 13:10.520
I tried to get her but the lines are busy.
I'm surprised you got through.

13:10.600 --> 13:15.600
- What about one of your neighbours?
- By the time I got outside they were all gone.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.840
Listen to me. I'm gonna make some calls.
I'm gonna get someone there to help you.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.600
I want you to sit and wait for my call.
Can you do that?

13:22.680 --> 13:26.160
Yes. I don't really have a choice.

13:26.240 --> 13:29.280
- I'll call you back. OK?
- OK, honey. Bye.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.840
We've delegated that
to Murphy's group.

13:38.920 --> 13:42.760
I'm not interested in that. We don't have
the luxury of miscommunications.

13:42.840 --> 13:47.840
Someone from my office will coordinate
between state police and the National Guard.

13:47.920 --> 13:52.000
Set up the conference call in ten minutes.
Thank you all.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.840
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. How are you holding up?

14:01.920 --> 14:04.720
Considering the situation we're in...

14:05.720 --> 14:07.360
I'm doing fine.

14:07.440 --> 14:12.560
The truth of the matter is... we do not have
the manpower to handle this mess.

14:12.640 --> 14:16.920
- Tell me what I can do.
- I've prioritised evacuation protocol,

14:17.000 --> 14:21.720
but I need someone to keep the state police
and the National Guard from interacting.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.600
All right.

14:23.680 --> 14:28.320
I'll stop the guard at the 75th-mile marker
and let the police take over from there.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.000
We'll maximise room for civilian traffic.

14:31.080 --> 14:35.480
I wish we had some other way
to get those people out of there.

14:35.560 --> 14:38.600
There's nowhere else to route them.

14:39.600 --> 14:44.120
Jack has got to find the override before
the rest of these reactors go critical.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.360
Hey, Jack. Good to have
you in the field again.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.360
- Thanks, Lee. You remember Tony Almeida?
- Yeah.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.240
- I don't know what he's doing here.
- I want him here.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.280
He's not authorised to be in the field.

15:07.360 --> 15:12.280
I'm going through that door first.
I want him there to back me up.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.240
Fine. Get another vest.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.880
- You got a visual on the suspect?
- We got a fibreoptic camera inside.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.200
The manager says there's
a mid forties female and a teenage male.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.720
Possibly mother and son.
Both Middle Eastern.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.280
We need them alive.
They're no good to us dead.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.160
- I've been briefed.
- Let's go.

15:38.360 --> 15:41.680
- " We got a visual on the woman.
- What about the kid?

15:41.760 --> 15:43.440
I haven't seen him yet.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.520
We gotta go, now.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.880
- You ready?
- Go.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.400
Don't move. Drop your weapon!

16:12.200 --> 16:15.200
Where is the override?
Tell me who's got it!

16:15.280 --> 16:16.760
Tell me.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.920
Now!

16:20.120 --> 16:22.520
- Agent Castle!
- Stand down!

16:22.600 --> 16:25.600
Lee, stand down!

16:27.120 --> 16:30.720
- I'm gonna get her to talk.
- She'll go into shock before she does.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.880
Agent Castle, step outside. Now!

16:35.080 --> 16:39.360
I want her prints and photograph
send over to CTU immediately.

16:39.760 --> 16:44.280
- He has no right to give me orders.
- Hey, come here.

16:44.360 --> 16:47.360
He did the right thing.
She was willing to kill herself.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.720
- She'd die before she gave in to force.
- We need to get her to talk now.

16:51.800 --> 16:55.680
- And we will.
- What do you have in mind?

16:55.760 --> 16:58.480
We need to find some leverage.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.520
- "CTU, Hudson."
- It's Jack. Put me through to Erin.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.680
Come here. Come here.

17:06.240 --> 17:08.200
Let me see your arm.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.880
- Driscoll.
- "We have a suspect."

17:10.960 --> 17:13.960
I'm sending fingerprints and photographs.
Run a profile.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.079
Send me all databases
and electronic communications.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.960
- Got it.
- Thank you.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.720
Hey,

17:20.800 --> 17:26.920
I understand your concerns about Almeida,
but for me, please, just give him a break.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.280
OK, Jack.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.560
- " Jack?
- Thanks.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
Yeah.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.520
This is a bullet wound.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.920
Probably a couple of hours old.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.320
The evacuation appears to be in
full swing, with delays on all routes.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.800
Excuse me.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.680
The nuclear emergency team
has just emerged from the plant.

17:52.760 --> 17:55.840
We can see them here on our skycam.

17:55.920 --> 18:01.080
They seem to be going through some
kind of decontamination process here.

18:01.160 --> 18:05.800
Their mission under these circumstances
is probably just to try and limit...

18:07.840 --> 18:09.320
- Behrooz.
- Uncle Naseem.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.480
You all right?

18:11.560 --> 18:13.080
Yeah, I think so.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.440
It's a disaster. Everyone's panicked
about radiation poisoning.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.280
They all want iodide pills.
Is that why you're here?

18:19.360 --> 18:20.920
No.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.240
I need pain medication.

18:23.320 --> 18:27.840
It's for my mother. She couldn't reach her
doctor, so she wanted me to get it from you.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.520
- What's wrong with her?
- It's her back.

18:30.600 --> 18:36.560
- She needs a prescription.
- I told you, she couldn't reach her doctor.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.160
I'll see what I can do, OK?
Just have a seat.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.680
- Yes?
- "Navi, it's Naseem."

19:03.760 --> 19:07.640
- Hello. How are you?
- "Well. But Behrooz showed up at the hospital."

19:07.720 --> 19:10.680
- "He seems disturbed."
- Is Dina there too?

19:10.760 --> 19:15.880
No. He says he needs pain medication for her,
but he's acting very strange.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.400
I'm sorry you have to be involved in this.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.240
- "Involved in what? What's going on?"
- Behrooz may be taking drugs.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.880
- "It's been getting worse."
- I'm sorry.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.480
- Me too.
- What do you want me to do?

19:29.040 --> 19:33.000
- Keep Behrooz there until I can come for him.
- How long will you be?

19:33.080 --> 19:35.280
- Fifteen minutes.
- "I'll do my best."

19:35.360 --> 19:39.200
Please, Naseem,
don't let him leave until I get there.

20:01.120 --> 20:06.320
... congestion. The government is asking
people to remain calm and exit...

20:06.400 --> 20:08.680
Excuse me, Ms Raines. I'm Edgar Stiles.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.160
- Sorry.
- We have a noncompliance problem.

20:11.240 --> 20:14.040
25% of the evacuees
aren't going where they should,

20:14.120 --> 20:16.960
and another 25% don't know
they're in the evac zone.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.720
However you need to do it,
make sure it gets done.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.720
- What is it?
- It's my mother.

20:26.800 --> 20:32.040
She lives near San Gabriel Island. She's in
a wheelchair and missed her call to evacuate.

20:32.120 --> 20:34.240
Maybe the National Guard can get her.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.320
The area commander said
he couldn't spare anyone.

20:37.400 --> 20:41.600
- I'm sorry, I'm not sure what I can do.
- Here's his number.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.920
I thought that maybe if you called him...

20:44.000 --> 20:50.240
Look, I hate asking for special treatment,
I wouldn't normally ask, but she's my mother.

20:52.280 --> 20:56.200
- I can't make any promises.
- Just promise me you'll try, OK?

20:58.720 --> 21:00.720
All right.

21:10.760 --> 21:16.760
I want you to give her something for the pain
but make sure she stays lucid. Understand?

21:26.120 --> 21:28.440
- Have you found out who she is yet?
- Yeah.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.360
She is Dina Araz.
She emigrated to the US five years ago.

21:31.440 --> 21:35.720
Became a citizen two years ago. Married to
Navi Araz, also a naturalised citizen.

21:35.800 --> 21:39.600
Owns an electronics store in Carson.
They have one son, Behrooz, 17.

21:39.680 --> 21:42.360
Junior at the local high.
No criminal records.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.680
- Not on any watch lists?
- Must have slipped under the radar.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.960
Send teams to the house and the store,
see what we can find.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.920
- Yeah?
- Jack, it's Driscoll.

21:51.000 --> 21:54.880
- "Homeland Security..."
- Hold on, Erin. I can barely hear you.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.320
- Go ahead.
- After the attack this morning,

21:57.400 --> 22:01.040
Homeland Security has been archiving
communications in the LA area.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.960
They pulled up a call that
may explain how Dina got shot.

22:04.040 --> 22:08.640
Erin, I'm gonna put you on speaker phone.
Hold on a second. You're on.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.920
This conversation happened two hours ago,
between the mother and the son.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.080
He wants me dead because
I messed up with Debbie.

22:15.160 --> 22:19.480
Behrooz, that's not possible.
Your father would never want to hurt you.

22:19.560 --> 22:22.400
It's true. Tariq told me everything.

22:22.480 --> 22:26.280
- "He was lying."
- "No, he wasn't."

22:27.360 --> 22:30.640
Mom, I don't know what to do.
You have to help me.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.760
Where are you now?

22:32.840 --> 22:36.040
I'm near the Metrolink station
on Lassen in Chatsworth.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.320
- "Are you using Tariq's car?"
- "Yes."

22:38.400 --> 22:43.000
- "Hide it. I'll pick you up there in a half-hour."
- "Hurry."

22:43.440 --> 22:46.680
That's it. Let me know the minute
you get something from her.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.080
Yeah.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.160
We got our leverage.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.120
Lee.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.760
How long have you been
planning this operation?

23:44.840 --> 23:47.160
Two years?

23:47.240 --> 23:48.680
Five years?

23:48.760 --> 23:50.760
Ten?

23:51.960 --> 23:54.520
All this planning for one day.

23:56.280 --> 24:02.920
You do realise, if all the reactors melt down...
hundreds of thousands of people will die.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.960
Every war has casualties.

24:05.040 --> 24:09.360
These people don't know about your war.
These people are innocent.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.920
No one is innocent.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.880
You really believe that?

24:13.960 --> 24:18.880
As strongly as you believe
in what you believe.

24:18.960 --> 24:24.640
So I won't waste your time or mine trying to
explain something you can never understand.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.760
Maybe I understand more than you think.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.440
I doubt it.

24:33.520 --> 24:38.280
I know that something happened today
to challenge your commitment to your war.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.840
You weren't willing to let
your son become a casualty.

24:41.920 --> 24:46.720
That's why you were shot.
Protecting him from his father.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.720
I understand that.

24:57.120 --> 25:00.040
I know what it's like

25:00.120 --> 25:02.960
to watch your child be threatened

25:03.040 --> 25:06.600
and feel helpless to do anything about it.

25:09.200 --> 25:12.520
Right now Behrooz is out there alone.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.560
And you and I know
he's not going to last very long.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.960
His father will find him...

25:19.720 --> 25:22.200
then kill him.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.840
There is another option.

25:33.680 --> 25:37.600
If you were to help us
find the override device,

25:37.680 --> 25:41.520
we "will" protect your son.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.240
So he can spend
the rest of his life in prison?

25:44.320 --> 25:47.520
No. So he can walk away from this
immune from prosecution.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.200
- How?
- Mrs Araz, your son is a minor.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.960
He's 17 years old.

25:53.040 --> 25:57.960
I can get him a legal and binding pardon
signed by the President of the United States.

25:58.040 --> 26:01.920
You don't have the authority to do this.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.240
I can reach the president.

26:05.080 --> 26:10.080
If you provide us with the information that
allows us to find the override device in time,

26:10.160 --> 26:13.840
I am confident that the president
will sign that pardon.

26:13.920 --> 26:19.920
This offer expires the second another
reactor melts down. Do you understand me?

26:22.440 --> 26:26.720
You don't have a lot of time.
I would think about this.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.280
Show me this document,

26:31.680 --> 26:34.400
and I'll help you find what you want.

26:52.520 --> 26:55.600
Can we rule out this boy's
involvement with the terrorists?

26:55.680 --> 26:59.120
No. It's likely he knew of his parents' plans
and that he helped them.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.120
You're asking me
to grant clemency to a terrorist.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.560
Mr President, I don't think we have a choice.

27:04.640 --> 27:08.360
In all of my experience, I believe
that we have to give in to her demands.

27:08.440 --> 27:11.000
- Have you tried negotiating?
- We don't have time.

27:11.080 --> 27:15.280
In two hours, five reactors will go critical
unless we find the override device.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.360
She is our only link.

27:19.040 --> 27:22.240
I'm uncomfortable with this,
but I trust your judgment.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.240
I'll release the letter.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.880
Thank you, Mr President.

27:29.480 --> 27:33.120
Make sure that document is non binding.

27:34.720 --> 27:39.040
Yes, I understand. I'll get back to you
on the redeployment figures.

27:39.120 --> 27:40.480
Ms Raines?

27:40.560 --> 27:42.960
- Did you talk to them?
- Yes.

27:44.480 --> 27:49.000
- I'm sorry, they can't get your mother.
- Why not? They're five miles off the highway.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.200
- They know where she is.
- What's the problem?

27:51.280 --> 27:56.480
Thousands of people are stuck. It's taking the
police and the National Guard to move them.

27:56.560 --> 28:01.040
- So, who cares about one old woman?
- They have to save the most number of lives.

28:01.120 --> 28:06.680
If my mother were rich or a politician,
they'd find a way to save her.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.280
Communications.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.600
I need another switching station
to that number. Do you need it?

28:27.680 --> 28:31.680
- "No, I've got it logged. Hold the line."
- Thank you.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.920
- "Go ahead, please."
- Mom.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.240
- Hello, honey.
- I can't get anyone out there to help you.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.560
- "I've done everything I could. I did."
- I'm sure you did.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.120
- "It's OK."
- It's not OK.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.000
The fallout's coming towards you.
It's 15 miles away.

28:50.080 --> 28:53.240
I know. I'm watching it on the news.

28:53.320 --> 28:56.000
And... I know what to do.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.480
There's nothing you can do.
You can't stuff towels under the door.

28:59.560 --> 29:03.240
- That's not what I'm talking about doing.
- What do you mean?

29:04.240 --> 29:07.080
They talked about radiation poisoning.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.760
That's not something I want to go through.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.360
Especially since there's
only one way it can end.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.080
Honey,

29:15.160 --> 29:18.440
I want to end things on my terms,

29:18.520 --> 29:21.440
as opposed to all that pain and suffering.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.600
Mom...

29:22.680 --> 29:26.680
It's the right thing to do.
It's the only thing, you know that.

29:26.760 --> 29:29.120
No, I don't.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.760
You have been a wonderful son, Edgar.

29:31.840 --> 29:35.080
You've been a gift to me and your father.

29:35.160 --> 29:38.840
It's OK. I'm going to a better place, and...

29:38.920 --> 29:42.320
I'll see you there.
But not for a long time.

29:42.400 --> 29:45.760
You've got a lot ahead of you, great things.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.880
Maybe I can get someone to you.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.800
You've got a very important job to do there.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.080
A lot of people are counting on you.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.080
So...

29:58.120 --> 30:00.760
I'm gonna hang up now.

30:00.840 --> 30:06.160
And I want you to know
how very very much I love you.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.360
Mom...

30:09.960 --> 30:11.760
Ma?

30:34.400 --> 30:36.600
Edgar, where are you going?

30:36.680 --> 30:37.680
Edgar?

30:37.760 --> 30:39.960
- I have to get out of here.
- What?

30:40.040 --> 30:43.040
My mother lives next to
the San Gabriel Island plant.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.440
She wasn't able to evacuate in time.

30:45.520 --> 30:48.920
We have five other reactors that
are on the verge of melting down.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.640
- I need you at your station.
- I don't care.

30:51.720 --> 30:56.040
You better start caring. You have a choice -
obey orders or end up in a jail cell.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.640
You'll arrest me for
saving my mother's life?

30:58.720 --> 31:03.320
If what you're saying is true, there's
nothing you can do for your mother.

31:03.400 --> 31:06.200
But there are thousands of others
who you can save.

31:06.280 --> 31:12.640
If your mother were here, what would make
her proud? What would she want you do to?

31:17.960 --> 31:21.400
- She'd want me to help.
- Then don't you think you should?

31:37.360 --> 31:42.160
" We're ready to go.
We're just setting up a comm line.

31:44.320 --> 31:48.520
This is a pardon for your son
signed by the president.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.920
- This is acceptable.
- Where is he?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.360
He is at Lindauer Memorial Hospital.
It's not far.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.760
Set up a perimeter around Lindauer Memorial.

31:56.840 --> 32:01.320
I want you to call him, tell him we're coming
to pick him up. Give her the phone.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.560
We have to record the call.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.680
- Hello?
- It's me. Where are you?

32:19.760 --> 32:23.320
Waiting for Naseem.
I don't know why he's taking so long.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.880
Don't worry about that now.
Things have changed.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.800
- What do you mean?
- Listen carefully, Behrooz.

32:29.880 --> 32:34.720
Government agents found me.
I'm with them now.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.360
Behrooz, they know everything.

32:37.440 --> 32:40.040
Behrooz, just a few more minutes, OK?

32:40.760 --> 32:42.880
But it's all right.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.680
Everything is going to be all right.

32:46.120 --> 32:49.520
- I made a deal.
- What are you talking about?

32:49.600 --> 32:51.360
You're going to be OK.

32:51.840 --> 32:56.320
You won't be arrested,
or even named in any of this.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.640
I don't understand.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.760
I'm going to help them stop your father.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.440
You are?

33:05.520 --> 33:07.280
Yes.

33:09.040 --> 33:13.040
You said that I would be OK.
But what about you?

33:14.720 --> 33:20.280
We'll talk about that later. Right now
these men are coming to pick you up.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.520
I want you to go with them.

33:23.600 --> 33:27.080
- Are they making you say this?
- No.

33:27.920 --> 33:33.920
I don't know who these people are. I want to
be sure they're not forcing you to say this.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.160
I'll come with them.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.920
You'll know when you see me. OK?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.800
- I'll meet you outside.
- No.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.880
Tell him to go to the emergency room,
where it's crowded.

33:44.960 --> 33:47.840
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.800
I'll see you in a few minutes, Behrooz.

33:50.880 --> 33:52.160
OK.

33:53.160 --> 33:57.280
We're transferring the suspect.
I want to set up a protective cordon now.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.320
Let's go.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.880
Uncle Naseem,

34:14.960 --> 34:17.199
I have to go.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.280
What about the pain medication?

34:19.360 --> 34:23.840
My mom's gonna get it from somewhere else,
but thanks for trying.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.239
Behrooz.

34:27.320 --> 34:29.159
- I can't let you go.
- Why not?

34:29.239 --> 34:31.719
- I spoke to your father.
- What?

34:31.800 --> 34:36.120
- He told me you need help.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.480
- I gave your father my word.
- My father is a terrorist.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.480
- Stop talking crazy.
- I swear.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.679
- You're talking nonsense.
- I'm not.

34:44.760 --> 34:48.000
He's behind the kidnapping
and the reactors melting down.

34:48.080 --> 34:52.639
We're all involved, my mother and me.
We've killed people.

34:52.719 --> 34:56.600
Your father will be furious when he hears this.

34:57.960 --> 34:59.800
My father's coming here?

35:01.760 --> 35:03.360
No!

35:03.440 --> 35:05.000
Behrooz!

35:39.840 --> 35:43.200
I tried to stop him.

36:06.840 --> 36:10.600
You broke my heart, Behrooz.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.960
You broke my heart.

36:14.040 --> 36:17.520
If you kill me,
Mother will tell them everything.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.280
- Tell who?
- The police. She's with them.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.160
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

36:22.240 --> 36:26.240
She wants me to be safe. If you kill me,
she will ruin everything you're doing.

36:26.320 --> 36:30.840
If you don't believe me look outside.
They're coming to pick me up.

36:46.080 --> 36:48.080
- Help!
- Shut up.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.520
- Tony, did you notify Security?
- No.

36:58.600 --> 37:01.680
" Something is wrong.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.320
Set up a level-three cordon
around the hospital.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.720
- I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.480
- What's going on?
- A pharmacist has been shot. Who are you?

37:21.560 --> 37:25.680
Jack Bauer. I work with CTU. We've
been tracking the shooter. Where is he?

37:25.760 --> 37:28.960
Someone radioed in from C Wing.
A Middle Eastern man has a hostage.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.040
- A 17-year-old boy?
- I think so.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.680
What are the possible exits?

37:32.760 --> 37:36.000
He'll end up in the east parking garage.
We got men heading there.

37:36.080 --> 37:41.240
Tell your supervisor to tell his men to back
off. No one makes contact. Understand me?

37:41.320 --> 37:43.640
Hang on a sec.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.200
- Yeah?
- "It's Jack."

37:45.280 --> 37:47.720
Navi is here.
He's killed his wife's brother.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.280
- What about the boy?
- I don't know.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.000
Lock down exits.
He's headed for the parking garage.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.520
Meet me on the east of
the building with backup.

37:54.600 --> 37:58.000
Copy. We're going to the east of the building.
Backup teams there now.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.000
- What happened?
- We're still looking for your son.

38:08.080 --> 38:12.120
- There's more, tell me.
- Mrs Araz, we're gonna find your son.

38:21.040 --> 38:23.040
I hate you.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.880
I've always hated you,

38:24.960 --> 38:28.640
and the only reason I never said so
was because I was afraid of you.

38:28.720 --> 38:31.400
But I'm not afraid of you any more.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.760
- Get in.
- Go to hell.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.920
Get in!

38:44.800 --> 38:47.280
We're in the garage.
We've secured the exit.

38:47.360 --> 38:50.160
- I'm almost there. Can you get an ID?
- Nothing yet.

39:12.680 --> 39:16.200
Let me see your hands!
Put your hands where I can see them, now!

39:16.280 --> 39:18.440
- Careful!
- " Drop the gun!

39:18.520 --> 39:21.840
- You'll hit the boy.
- Let the boy go!

39:21.920 --> 39:26.760
We can work this out. I will put my gun down
if you give me the boy. All I want is the boy.

39:26.840 --> 39:29.200
- Stay back!
- Put the gun down!

39:29.280 --> 39:31.440
Put the gun... Tony, stop the car!

39:31.520 --> 39:33.200
- Behrooz!
- Mom!

39:33.280 --> 39:35.520
Keep her in the car.

39:35.960 --> 39:40.400
That stairwell leads to the basement. He's got
to go down. Set up a link with CTU now!

39:40.480 --> 39:42.480
Copy that. Call CTU, we need backup.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.760
Mrs Araz, calm down.
We'll get your son.

40:05.320 --> 40:10.040
We've uploaded the plans to you.
There are only three exits from the basement.

40:10.120 --> 40:13.200
We've got all entrances and exits covered.
He's trapped.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.720
- Let's try to open up a negotiation.
- My husband won't negotiate.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.560
- Why's that?
- He doesn't need to.

40:18.640 --> 40:22.720
He has to assume I have agreed to help you
in return for my son's safety.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.400
- He can't stay down there forever.
- He won't.

40:25.480 --> 40:28.240
In two hours, all the reactors
will have gone critical.

40:28.320 --> 40:32.320
After that, it won't matter what I tell you,
and he can kill my son.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.880
I am only helping you to save his life.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.960
I believe in our cause,

40:38.040 --> 40:44.600
and if you can't save my son,
I am happy to see the reactors melt down.

40:46.200 --> 40:47.920
Did you get that?
