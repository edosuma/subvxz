<i>Something that had been buried for
centuries has just been uncovered.</i>

00:33.075 --> 00:37.205
<i>And as this mysterious force
moves across the southern valley,</i>

<i>it leaves behind
only silence and death.</i>

02:33.737 --> 02:35.785
Take your seats, please.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.543
I just talked with the Cartel.

02:47.569 --> 02:50.196
They're concerned that the rumors
are getting out of control.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.261
They'd like to make a statement
in two hours.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.101
Some of you may not know
we've had another incident.

02:56.343 --> 03:00.689
At 1520 hours yesterday a freight
train, Trans Marineris 74 Yankee,

03:00.931 --> 03:04.185
<i>returned from the southern
valley on auto pilot.</i>

03:04.434 --> 03:07.313
GUARD 1: Get to your
security stations now!

03:16.947 --> 03:18.164
GUARD 2:
Okay, let's move!

03:25.455 --> 03:28.459
<i>INQUISITOR: Initial reports
indicated it was a ghost train.</i>

03:28.709 --> 03:31.057
<i>It appeared no one was

03:37.968 --> 03:40.892
second officer for a
squad of escort police.

03:41.096 --> 03:44.817
They were assigned to transfer a prisoner
from the jail at Shining Canyon Mine

03:44.975 --> 03:45.976
back here to Chryse.

03:47.394 --> 03:50.273
<i>Lieutenant Ballard was taken
to hospital under guard.</i>

<i>She had superficial wounds but was
in otherwise good physical condition.</i>

illegal substance,</i>

found in her system.</i>

Take it easy.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.706
Bring her in, please.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.267
Lieutenant Ballard,
please be seated.

04:19.885 --> 04:23.389
Do I get a lawyer, or don't police
officers have rights these days?

04:23.638 --> 04:26.767
Representation by counsel
won't be necessary.

Then I'm not being charged?
INQUISITOR: Sit down, lieutenant.

04:34.357 --> 04:38.863
This is a discovery hearing, and your
presence is required as ranking officer.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.373
I want your After Action Report.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.705
Where's the rest of your team? The
prisoner you were sent to pick up?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.204
What happened at Shining Canyon?

04:48.330 --> 04:53.052
Last Friday at 1750, we were
slamming through a dust storm

04:53.293 --> 04:55.546
<i>on the edge of the southern valley.</i>

04:56.880 --> 05:01.602

the mines in the outer sector.</i>

Be straighter than this track
long before we hit the canyon.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.593
You better be. This prisoner
transfer is no sleepwalk.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.257
We're picking up
James Williams.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.259
You mean
“Desolation" Williams?

07:05.508 --> 07:10.059
Cooling his heels in the Shining
Canyon jail. Deep solitary.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.688
What's the charge this time?
Murder.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.772
Man's been up on murder
three times.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.734
He gets off every time
on self-defense.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.691
It's different this time. Sounds
like he finally went psycho.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.615
Beaucoup corpses,
all mutilated.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.201
Williams shows up at the Shining Canyon
Mine with some bizarre-ass story.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.122
Sends three officers to the medevac
before they locked him down.

see the picture?

of Sergeant Jericho?

07:39.793 --> 07:43.013
I mean, I was hoping we'd get a good,
solid woman we could count on.

I guess we'll see.

Well...

07:49.260 --> 07:52.764

Don't worry about that, commander.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.590
Here's your coffee,

You want some?
No, thanks.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.381

About 40.

08:45.608 --> 08:49.033
I couldn't help but notice that charming
little scene with the queen bee.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.281
Yeah, well, you know how
the service is, sergeant.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.956
She figures if I want to make
captain, I'll have to pay the price.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.704
The thing is, I don't give a
damn about wearing another bar.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.831
Yeah, it could be that.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.880
Or she just has
good taste in women.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.921
Sergeant, you are
seriously out of line.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.390

my record.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.725
I know you think you're
some pretty tough hombres.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.440
You've had the best training,
you have the best gear.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.610
You probably think this is
a routine prisoner transfer.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.483
But that's what I want
to bang into your heads.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.693
There's nothing routine
about this prisoner.

09:24.939 --> 09:28.239
We are here to pick up
James "Desolation" Williams.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.159

and double-tough.

Officers, you can
disembark here.

09:57.263 --> 10:00.358
What time is departure? We'll need at least
a half an hour to secure our prisoner.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.232
We got about a four-hour turnaround
and we're due back at this spot

10:03.394 --> 10:07.524
at around 2200. You can
report anytime after that.

your breathers.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.480
God, I hate this thing.
You'll get used to it.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.067
Two years ago we were still
wearing full-face breathers.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.489
Takes about a month to get
over the headaches out here.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.120
Huh.

10:54.279 --> 10:58.250

God, what a dump.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.753

Standard layout.

11:01.911 --> 11:05.506
Just another shitty boomtown like all the
others. Seen one, you can go home.

MELANIE: You're always cold,
you can't get a decent shower

11:07.917 --> 11:09.965
and they don't tell you
a one-year contract here

11:10.211 --> 11:12.805
equals two years
Earth time.

<i>Instead we got a graveyard.</i>

I mean, there'd be
a huge explosion, right?

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:41.096
No, not unless you retract the
control rods and expose the core.

Then what?

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:47.516

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:55.568
