WEBVTT

00:34.109 --> 00:37.736
<i>Once, I had it all.
Power, money, respect.</i>

00:37.903 --> 00:39.447
<i>I was a real somebody.</i>

00:39.613 --> 00:41.949
Oh, God. Let me out of the trunk.

00:42.116 --> 00:45.326
Shut up. You're interrupting
my inner monologue. Where was I?

00:45.493 --> 00:50.330
<i>Ah, yes. I was a real somebody.
But I squandered that life away.</i>

00:50.497 --> 00:52.124
<i>And now I'm a nobody again...</i>

00:52.291 --> 00:55.001
<i>... working the same old boring job
at the CIA.</i>

00:55.168 --> 00:57.253
I'm gonna die.
I am going to die.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.046
<i>It all started 12 days ago.</i>

00:59.213 --> 01:02.632
<i>But I remember it
like it was a week ago yesterday.</i>

01:03.466 --> 01:07.344
God, the world today, it's gone crazy.
Oh, this is yesterday's paper.

01:07.511 --> 01:09.513
"Pumpkin Amaretto Cream"?

01:09.680 --> 01:14.350
- Coffee Pal, you've done it again.
- You can't go out dressed like that.

01:14.517 --> 01:16.936
Don't worry, I'll be taking it off
at Art class...

01:17.103 --> 01:18.520
...where I'll be posing nude.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.689
- You'll do nothing of the sort.
- I'm late.

01:20.856 --> 01:22.858
Can we just cut
to the key yelling points?

01:23.025 --> 01:25.401
Fine. I forbid it.
Not while you're under my roof.

01:25.568 --> 01:26.694
I didn't raise a hussy.

01:26.861 --> 01:28.863
My right as a woman.
Nudity empowers me.

01:29.030 --> 01:31.615
There's nothing sinful
about the female form. We done?

01:31.781 --> 01:33.158
Yeah, we're done.

01:34.159 --> 01:36.577
God.

01:36.744 --> 01:39.622
You taste awful.

01:39.788 --> 01:41.956
They're coming.

01:47.961 --> 01:50.005
Greg and Terry, congratulations.

01:50.172 --> 01:54.592
You'll be Stop Number 6
in this year's Parade of Homes.

01:54.759 --> 01:57.595
Just think, in two weeks,
you'll have drunken strangers...

01:57.762 --> 01:59.930
...walking through your house
and judging you.

02:00.096 --> 02:02.724
Just like my mom's boyfriends
when I was growing up.

02:03.683 --> 02:06.518
Oh, Barb, tell me the Smiths
get a sign this year.

02:06.685 --> 02:08.812
You sure do.

02:17.069 --> 02:19.196
I'm gonna get the shrimp.
Something shrimp.

02:19.363 --> 02:21.698
Stan, this place is so fancy.

02:21.865 --> 02:25.493
Hey, you deserve a night of pampering
after today's big disappointment.

02:25.660 --> 02:29.829
Stan, Francine.
I didn't know you ate at restaurants.

02:29.996 --> 02:33.166
We don't have a reservation
but my husband is Chuck White.

02:33.333 --> 02:38.253
Of White Used Cars. Remember,
you'll never get robbed by a White guy.

02:38.420 --> 02:42.924
But of course. Give the esteemed
used-car salesman our finest table.

02:43.591 --> 02:47.177
Listen, we'd ask you to join us,
but you probably would.

02:47.719 --> 02:50.722
So mean.

02:51.514 --> 02:57.185
Hi, we don't have a reservation
but I'm Stan Smith of the CIA.

02:57.352 --> 03:02.774
The CIA? Why didn't you say so?
Right this way.

03:05.526 --> 03:07.861
Someone will be right with you.

03:08.445 --> 03:12.240
Hi, I'm Jonathan. I'll be
peeing on your feet this evening.

03:19.830 --> 03:23.708
Oh, we're so glad to have you, Hayley.
I know it's not easy to pose nude.

03:23.874 --> 03:27.669
Maybe for some people,
but I am a proud and evolved woman.

03:27.836 --> 03:30.380
And I have nothing to be ashamed of.

03:31.297 --> 03:32.798
Nice.

03:35.676 --> 03:37.928
Madam, please uncover yourself.

03:38.094 --> 03:41.889
Does anyone have more Areola Pink?
I only have one tube.

03:46.685 --> 03:51.397
Sea gulls. Francine,
this time they could drive.

04:26.217 --> 04:30.430
Tonight was so embarrassing.
I didn't know what to do, sis.

04:30.596 --> 04:33.432
What? I've never called you
"sis" before?

04:33.599 --> 04:36.559
You're right.
It is oddly clunky and expositional.

04:36.726 --> 04:41.147
I mean, I know you're my sister,
so who am I saying it for? Weird.

04:41.314 --> 04:45.609
Anyway, it wasn't just the restaurant
or the Parade of Homes.

04:45.775 --> 04:48.028
It's just everything.

04:48.194 --> 04:51.864
I mean, I love Stan.
But I don't know.

04:52.031 --> 04:53.990
I guess I just always pictured myself...

04:54.157 --> 04:57.535
...with somebody who was,
well, a somebody.

05:00.245 --> 05:01.914
So, what's going on with you, sis?

05:02.080 --> 05:04.583
Are you enjoying being
three years younger than me?

05:04.750 --> 05:06.918
You should have heard Francine
on the phone.

05:07.084 --> 05:09.837
She thinks she married a nobody.

05:10.004 --> 05:12.505
I appreciate you saying that, bro.

05:12.672 --> 05:16.176
I've called you "bro" before.
That's what we are. We're half brothers.

05:16.343 --> 05:19.136
I don't care how they say it
in New Glarence, Wisconsin...

05:19.303 --> 05:22.389
...where you live on a lake
and have nothing in common with me.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.599
Then maybe we should
just stay estranged...

05:24.766 --> 05:27.101
...until you can find
a dramatic enough reason...

05:27.268 --> 05:29.394
...to show up on my doorstep
unannounced.

05:30.896 --> 05:32.314
No, wait. That's my car.

05:32.481 --> 05:34.899
Here I am. Sir, I'm not
in a good place right now.

05:35.066 --> 05:36.651
Please don't give me a ticket.

05:36.817 --> 05:39.362
- Sorry. I already started.
- Well, then tear it up.

05:39.528 --> 05:41.154
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

05:41.321 --> 05:43.448
Paper is weak and you are strong.

05:43.615 --> 05:46.117
Come on. You can't
give me a ticket. You just can't.

05:46.284 --> 05:49.662
Why not? Who the hell are you?
You're just a nobody.

05:57.794 --> 06:01.546
- Please, stop.
- Sorry. I already started.

06:09.512 --> 06:14.015
- This is humiliating.
- Relax, Stan. Nothing's gonna happen.

06:14.182 --> 06:17.434
Punching a meter maid.
It's like punching a fat person.

06:17.601 --> 06:19.728
No one cares.

06:19.895 --> 06:24.565
Stan Smith, I sentence you
to two weeks of community service...

06:25.233 --> 06:26.818
...as a meter maid.

06:29.653 --> 06:32.239
A meter maid. How embarrassing.

06:32.406 --> 06:35.574
At least we'll get through this together.
Right, Francine?

06:50.337 --> 06:54.674
Stan, you're gonna be late
for your first day of community service.

06:54.841 --> 06:56.426
Everyone's gonna laugh at me.

06:56.591 --> 06:59.219
Hey, there are worse things
than being laughed at.

06:59.386 --> 07:02.555
And in that uniform,
all those things will happen to you.

07:02.721 --> 07:06.392
Hey, Dad, what's your route?
It's not near my school, is it?

07:06.559 --> 07:11.729
Because I'd want to tell all my friends
to be on the lookout for a cool guy.

07:11.896 --> 07:14.356
You buying that?
Can I look up from my plate?

07:14.523 --> 07:17.776
I can't believe I have to miss
two weeks of paid work for this.

07:17.943 --> 07:20.194
It's okay,
I'm used to doing without.

07:20.361 --> 07:21.737
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

07:21.904 --> 07:24.699
Just being passive-aggressive.

07:26.408 --> 07:28.452
The lines I drew serve their purpose.

07:28.618 --> 07:31.413
Though, it's the lines I didn't draw
that haunt me.

07:31.579 --> 07:34.582
Roger, you had no right coming
to that class and sketching me.

07:34.748 --> 07:37.584
The subject telling the artist
what he can and can't do?

07:37.750 --> 07:40.587
That's like a soup can telling Warhol
where to buy speed.

07:40.753 --> 07:43.255
You are not keeping
a naked drawing in this house.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.382
Didn't you say your nudity
empowered you?

07:45.549 --> 07:48.385
That there was nothing sinful
about the female form?

07:48.552 --> 07:50.386
This isn't over.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.765
Really? You're leaving. I'm not
thinking about it. Sure feels over.

07:56.099 --> 07:58.560
Pay attention because
I'm gonna be throwing you...

07:58.727 --> 07:59.769
...some big concepts.

07:59.936 --> 08:03.480
You put your key in the meter.
You turn it to the right. The right!

08:03.647 --> 08:05.065
And you empty it. You got it?

08:05.232 --> 08:07.275
What happens if you turn
it to the left?

08:07.442 --> 08:09.527
Oh, nothing. It only turns one way.

08:09.694 --> 08:11.779
How can you take pride in this job?

08:11.946 --> 08:14.656
Since I put on these sporty
yet functional cargo pants...

08:14.823 --> 08:16.825
...my wife can barely
look me in the face.

08:16.992 --> 08:18.743
Mine looks me in the face
and more...

08:18.910 --> 08:21.787
...because she knows I'm on
these mean streets every day...

08:21.954 --> 08:26.249
...juggling power and justice
like they were damn chain saws.

08:28.293 --> 08:34.381
No, wait. This is my store. I was just
inside making some fresh bagels for you.

08:35.131 --> 08:37.383
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

08:37.549 --> 08:41.553
- Man, he was really afraid of you.
- It's called respect, cupcake.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.429
It comes with the uniform.

08:43.597 --> 08:46.850
And with it,
you can get anything you want.

08:52.688 --> 08:55.982
You booted my car?
You have to take that off.

08:56.149 --> 08:58.777
- I have a meeting to get to.
- Well, you're out of luck.

08:58.944 --> 09:02.029
That is unless the meeting is about
including the Smith house...

09:02.196 --> 09:03.572
...in the Parade of Homes.

09:03.739 --> 09:06.282
Well, no, actually it's about...

09:07.617 --> 09:09.786
What? Did you forget something
in the office?

09:09.953 --> 09:13.455
No. I just realized
you're blackmailing me.

09:16.958 --> 09:20.753
Stan, what are we doing here?
I don't want to be embarrassed again.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.921
Relax. Things are different now.

09:23.088 --> 09:25.590
We'd like to be seated.

09:25.757 --> 09:29.426
Green Bonneville, isn't it? Nice car.

09:29.593 --> 09:31.762
Be a shame if you were to wake up
one day...

09:31.929 --> 09:33.597
...and that nice car was booted.

09:33.764 --> 09:37.975
Touché, monsieur. Touché.

09:40.977 --> 09:44.439
Stan, this is the nicest table
in the restaurant.

09:44.606 --> 09:46.273
I can't smell either bathroom.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.525
Get used to it, doll.

09:47.692 --> 09:50.736
You're with a meter maid now.
And everything is on the house.

09:50.903 --> 09:54.072
- Caviar, milady?
- Gross.

09:54.239 --> 09:57.325
- Thank you.
- No, no, really dig in there.

09:57.491 --> 09:59.368
The good part's at the bottom.

10:00.285 --> 10:03.788
Congratulations.
You're in the Parade of Homes.

10:06.165 --> 10:08.626
<i>Francine finally had what she wanted.</i>

10:08.793 --> 10:10.293
<i>She was married to a somebody.</i>

10:10.460 --> 10:12.963
<i>And she was enjoying
a taste of the good life.</i>

10:13.130 --> 10:16.257
<i>Unfortunately, I didn 't count on her
having an appetite.</i>

10:16.424 --> 10:19.969
<i>The appetite of a good-life elephant.</i>

10:20.136 --> 10:24.055
<i>Does that make sense?
It doesn 't need to. I was a meter maid.</i>

10:25.974 --> 10:30.102
- Welcome to the club, Francine.
- Look how shiny your sign is.

10:30.269 --> 10:33.521
Thank you.
Look how short your shorts are.

10:35.440 --> 10:39.025
Francine, I heard you bullied
your way into the Parade of Homes.

10:39.192 --> 10:42.362
Too bad you can't strong arm
your house into looking presentable.

10:42.529 --> 10:43.989
I think it looks okay.

10:44.155 --> 10:46.198
Well, if you think "okay"
is good enough...

10:46.365 --> 10:48.742
...then you're as stupid
as your house is ugly.

10:48.909 --> 10:52.454
Oh, my God, I'm a bitch.
Okay, vroom-vroom.

10:52.620 --> 10:56.039
She's right.
My house looks so ordinary.

10:56.206 --> 10:59.543
Especially compared to yours.
How do you guys do it?

10:59.710 --> 11:02.962
Oh, well, we hired celebrity Jamaican
house-painter Belmonpau.

11:04.714 --> 11:08.592
Man, I'm higher than a king snake
in a sugar-cane tree.

11:12.762 --> 11:13.804
City streets.

11:13.971 --> 11:16.682
I want our house painted.
By Belmonpau.

11:16.849 --> 11:19.267
I don't know.
I've heard he's pretty expensive.

11:19.434 --> 11:21.978
Stan, expensive is only a problem...

11:22.145 --> 11:26.481
...when people aren't persuaded
to give their meter maid things for free.

11:28.025 --> 11:31.194
Oh, please, sir, if I have to pay
that ticket you're writing...

11:31.360 --> 11:33.946
...I won't be able to buy
medicine this month.

11:34.113 --> 11:36.282
You've lived long enough.

11:39.492 --> 11:42.078
And I don't paint houses for free, man.

11:42.245 --> 11:45.289
You must have some parking tickets.
I can make those disappear.

11:45.456 --> 11:48.167
You meter maids are always trying
to muscle me.

11:48.334 --> 11:49.959
But I got news for you, mister.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.212
In addition to being
the world's best house-painter...

11:53.379 --> 11:56.089
...I'm also the Jamaican ambassador.

11:57.966 --> 11:59.009
That's right.

11:59.176 --> 12:03.179
Man, I have diplomatic plates
on my car. You can't touch me now.

12:03.346 --> 12:05.222
Now, go on, get out of here.

12:05.389 --> 12:11.186
And tell all your friends
Belmonpau is looking for some weed.

12:21.986 --> 12:25.697
- You lent Steve the drawing?
- Relax. He doesn't know it's you.

12:25.864 --> 12:28.742
I know it's me.
Do you know what he just did with it?

12:28.909 --> 12:30.952
If you disagree
with my lending policies...

12:31.118 --> 12:32.995
...you can buy the drawing
for yourself.

12:33.162 --> 12:35.121
- Fine. How much?
- Thanks for the loan.

12:35.288 --> 12:38.833
- Can I borrow it again in four minutes?
- No. Because I'm buying it.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.128
What? You can't.
I need it. I'll buy it.

12:43.295 --> 12:45.130
Recent rumblings
from the art world...

12:45.297 --> 12:47.632
...suggest the market
should decide this one.

12:47.799 --> 12:50.718
I'll be holding the auction
this Saturday.

12:53.095 --> 12:57.307
Who ever heard of a sad clown?

12:58.100 --> 13:01.852
<i>I guess I just always
pictured myself with a somebody.</i>

13:02.019 --> 13:05.480
<i>Somebody. Somebody.
Somebody.</i>

13:08.483 --> 13:11.193
Francine, call Belmonpau.

13:11.360 --> 13:15.364
We're gonna be able to afford
that paint job after all.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.883
Rise and shine, meter man.

13:39.050 --> 13:41.260
Thanks again for getting
the house painted.

13:41.427 --> 13:44.012
Thanks for helping me
hide the salami last night.

13:44.179 --> 13:46.681
That darn neighbor's cat,
always stealing our salami.

13:46.848 --> 13:48.808
Hey, hand me my cargo shorts,
would you?

14:01.777 --> 14:04.362
Seems like more change
than you usually carry.

14:07.115 --> 14:11.869
Stan, is there something
you're not telling me?

14:12.035 --> 14:16.414
Yes. I've decided you should
go buy yourself a Jacuzzi.

14:16.581 --> 14:18.833
But my suspicions.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.211
- And Jacuzzi lessons.
- Oh, Stan.

14:24.171 --> 14:27.923
<i>It was one thing when Stan was
just feared by the chumps he ticketed.</i>

14:28.090 --> 14:32.135
<i>But when Stan was feared
and had the money to back it up...</i>

14:32.302 --> 14:34.929
<i>... we had finally arrived.</i>

14:35.638 --> 14:38.724
Hey, everybody.
The rinse cycle's on me.

14:45.062 --> 14:47.565
<i>I didn 't know where the quarters
were coming from...</i>

14:47.732 --> 14:49.233
<i>... and I didn 't want to know...</i>

14:49.399 --> 14:51.067
<i>... as long as they kept coming.</i>

14:52.903 --> 14:58.115
- I can almost see the airport.
- You can look all day, baby.

15:01.659 --> 15:04.287
<i>We were different than everyone.</i>

15:05.997 --> 15:08.874
<i>And because we were different,
the rules didn 't apply to us.</i>

15:10.417 --> 15:13.002
<i>I know there are women
who would have gotten out...</i>

15:13.169 --> 15:15.880
<i>... the minute they saw their husband
in that uniform.</i>

15:18.215 --> 15:19.507
<i>But I got to admit...</i>

15:19.674 --> 15:24.262
<i>... there was something about Stan
ticketing people that turned me on.</i>

15:24.428 --> 15:30.183
<i>Our next piece is Lot 247,
Headless Naked Whore. Do I hear 20?</i>

15:30.350 --> 15:31.392
- Twenty.
- Twenty-five.

15:31.559 --> 15:32.602
A hundred dollars.

15:32.769 --> 15:36.563
Be warned, I am proxy-bidding
for an anonymous patron in Zurich.

15:36.730 --> 15:39.524
Anonymous and very wealthy.

15:39.691 --> 15:41.526
- One hundred and one dollars.
- I'm out.

15:41.693 --> 15:42.985
- Two hundred.
- Two-fifty.

15:43.152 --> 15:44.695
Five thousand dollars.

15:45.529 --> 15:49.074
- Sold. Sold. A thousand times sold.
- Mom?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.785
It's the perfect piece to hang
in our dining room...

15:51.952 --> 15:53.286
...for the Parade of Homes.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.621
No, you can't.

15:57.289 --> 16:01.376
Well, I guess it's back to squinting
really hard till stuff looks like boobs.

16:08.590 --> 16:13.094
- Enjoying your coffee, Smith?
- I'm not drinking coffee.

16:13.260 --> 16:14.303
I'm just testing.

16:14.470 --> 16:17.555
If you were a liar, you might
say you were enjoying your coffee.

16:17.722 --> 16:19.349
Maybe drink
from an imaginary cup.

16:19.516 --> 16:21.518
Who are you
and why do you freak me out?

16:21.685 --> 16:23.894
Turlington, Parking Internal Affairs.

16:24.061 --> 16:27.231
Our quarter count's been low lately.
Any idea why?

16:27.398 --> 16:30.233
Well, I guess
gas is so cheap these days...

16:30.400 --> 16:33.861
...that people have been driving around
and not parking?

16:37.322 --> 16:40.533
Yeah. I got a kid of my own.
I know what you're going through.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.576
Okay, you can go.

16:42.743 --> 16:47.789
I know it couldn't possibly be you.
But Smith, I'm onto you.

16:52.126 --> 16:54.294
This couch is upholstered
in cheetah...

16:54.461 --> 16:57.131
...and the throw pillows
are made from her cubs.

16:57.297 --> 17:00.758
We didn't wanna separate them.
That would be cruel.

17:01.259 --> 17:04.428
I have a number of influences.
Chagall, Rembrandt...

17:04.594 --> 17:06.430
...huffing a garbage bag
of gasoline.

17:09.640 --> 17:12.935
Believe it or not,
the beautiful marble on this wall...

17:13.102 --> 17:15.854
...came from Italy,
not from marbles.

17:17.063 --> 17:21.191
- Francine, I think we have a problem.
- What are you talking about?

17:24.403 --> 17:27.070
The jig is up. Internal Affairs
knows about everything.

17:27.238 --> 17:29.031
The quarters, the dimes, the nickels.

17:29.198 --> 17:32.160
My God. The nickels?
We have to destroy everything...

17:32.326 --> 17:34.411
...we bought with that dirty change.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.334
Dump it. Dump it all.

17:55.762 --> 17:57.972
Left my badge in the car.

17:58.598 --> 18:00.892
Everything goes.

18:01.058 --> 18:03.393
Fire will cleanse our sins.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.858
Forgot my sunglasses.

18:11.483 --> 18:14.027
That was bought with dirty money.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.655
My art. You've destroyed
my drawing of Hayley.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.740
Hayley?

18:21.366 --> 18:24.703
It's obvious what you have to do, Steve.
You have to kill yourself.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.954
What? Why? Nobody saw.

18:27.121 --> 18:29.582
God saw. Everyone in heaven saw.

18:29.749 --> 18:32.876
Aunt Sadie, Great Gram-Gram,
Star Trek's James Doohan.

18:33.043 --> 18:37.004
- Scotty saw?
- Scotty watched the whole damn thing.

18:37.171 --> 18:42.051
You know what, Roger? This whole thing
is your fault. I am gonna kick your ass.

18:42.217 --> 18:45.470
You think you got a shot, porn star?
Then bring it.

18:45.637 --> 18:49.973
I wasn't ready.
This is how Houdini died.

18:51.475 --> 18:53.477
Wait.

18:53.644 --> 18:57.229
I'm headed inside.
I don't need sunglasses.

18:59.607 --> 19:01.942
Are they flushing?
They're not flushing.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.693
I'm so sorry, Francine.

19:03.860 --> 19:07.237
I never should have exposed you
to this stinking life of corruption.

19:07.404 --> 19:09.782
I just wanted you to think
you married a somebody.

19:09.949 --> 19:10.991
What?

19:11.158 --> 19:13.201
I heard you on the phone
with your sister.

19:13.368 --> 19:15.745
I know you think
you could've done better than me.

19:15.912 --> 19:17.413
Oh, Stan, you heard that?

19:17.580 --> 19:22.876
No. I was wrong. I should have been
happy with what we had.

19:27.630 --> 19:29.673
So it's time.

19:29.839 --> 19:32.967
Yes, Stan. I'll need your badge
and cargo shorts.

19:33.134 --> 19:35.178
I understand.

19:37.471 --> 19:41.100
I know this means nothing now,
but I'm sorry.

19:41.265 --> 19:44.602
Sorry? I just came by to give you
your certificate of completion.

19:44.769 --> 19:47.437
As of today,
your community service is finished.

19:47.604 --> 19:51.233
Wait. I'm not a suspect
in the missing-quarters case?

19:51.400 --> 19:54.485
The funny thing is,
I did suspect you.

19:54.652 --> 19:58.364
But then I did some digging
and I found out that you're in the CIA.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.740
Some folks might not respect that
anymore...

20:00.907 --> 20:04.576
...but I know a CIA agent
can always be trusted.

20:04.743 --> 20:09.873
Unless he's a liar, which you aren't.
If you hear anything, let us know.

20:10.040 --> 20:14.252
Otherwise, even if you were somehow
involved, you'll never hear from us again.

20:21.007 --> 20:24.552
<i>So that's my story.
You can pass judgment if you want.</i>

20:24.718 --> 20:27.721
<i>But if you've never experienced
a ticket book in one hand...</i>

20:27.888 --> 20:29.848
<i>... and a sack of quarters
in the other...</i>

20:30.014 --> 20:32.851
<i>... you'll never truly understand.</i>

20:33.017 --> 20:37.312
<i>Of course, I had to go back to the CIA
and resume my boring life.</i>

20:55.077 --> 20:56.412
Raid, raid, raid.

20:57.996 --> 21:00.665
Cover me.

21:05.127 --> 21:10.423
<i>No more excitement, no more power.
I'm back to being a nobody.</i>

21:11.674 --> 21:13.801
Just a regular schnook.

21:50.539 --> 21:52.625
