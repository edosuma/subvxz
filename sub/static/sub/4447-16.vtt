You sure school
is worth all this?

00:03.417 --> 00:06.333
Dan, I'm going to graduate,
pass the bar up North

00:06.333 --> 00:07.667
and work in the DA's office.

00:07.667 --> 00:08.959
You're applying
for a scholarship?

00:08.959 --> 00:09.959
I have one now,
for cheerleading.

welcome to Cheertown.'

I'm afraid
I let all of you down.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.667
I know now that
an innocent man went to jail

00:17.667 --> 00:20.000
for my crime and that's why
I've come forward

00:20.000 --> 00:21.500
and told the district attorney

00:21.500 --> 00:23.834
that Travis Guthrie must go free

00:23.834 --> 00:25.875
and I must do my time.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.875

a mistake. We were both drunk.'

his locker and said, "See ya."

I'm not losing him again.

a little insulting.

there, he's the best man.

That's right, and he's only
in town for the weekend.

if you don't do this.

have nothing to be afraid of.

to settle this

is meant to be.

to the wedding, though.

to get my strength up.

you and me brother and sister.

20:00.708 --> 20:03.166
Not since Luke and Leia, huh?

20:07.500 --> 20:10.041
- Okay.
- Yo, M, uh, wait up.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.417
- Yeah.
- We need to talk.

20:14.834 --> 20:16.917
I owe you an apology.

20:16.917 --> 20:19.542
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

20:19.542 --> 20:21.834
I left you
with a big mess in your lap

20:21.834 --> 20:23.208
and then I wouldn't take
your calls and I--

20:23.208 --> 20:26.917
Okay, stop.
You don't owe me an apology.

20:26.917 --> 20:30.708
I was horrible
about how I handled everything.

20:30.708 --> 20:33.041
- I've thought a lot about--
- I've been thinking...

20:33.041 --> 20:34.834
Sorry. You first.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.333
Ladies first.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.542
Okay, well, um...

20:41.500 --> 20:44.458
It's been really weird
around here without you.

20:44.458 --> 20:47.667
- And I've been thinking--
- Mushroom puff?

20:47.667 --> 20:49.875
Savannah.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.375
You look good.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.917
Thank you.

20:53.917 --> 20:56.375
I hope
I didn't interrupt anything.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.041
- No.
- No. No, not at all.

20:58.041 --> 21:00.750
- I'm glad to see you.
- 'Dan!'

21:00.750 --> 21:04.917
- There you are.
- Hey, you.

21:04.917 --> 21:08.083
Um, Marti, Savannah,
this is Vicky.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.250
She came up to Memphis with me
from New Orleans.

21:10.250 --> 21:14.083
We, uh, met on a boat
doing oil-spill reclamation.

21:14.083 --> 21:16.750
I'm passionate about shorebirds.

21:16.750 --> 21:20.834
I've cleaned oil
off of 276 of them so far.

21:22.458 --> 21:24.750
[sighing]
Are those mushroom puffs?

21:24.750 --> 21:26.458
Awesome.

21:35.959 --> 21:37.208
[guitar music]

21:38.792 --> 21:42.250
The chicks live in the marsh
where the oil is

21:42.250 --> 21:44.834
and then the oil gets on
their little downy bellies

21:44.834 --> 21:49.125
and then they clean their
feathers and, well, you see that

21:49.125 --> 21:53.625
276 times, it's devastating.

21:53.625 --> 21:55.583
Devastating.

21:55.583 --> 21:58.792
I admire your dedication.

21:58.792 --> 22:02.291
I can't imagine how those birds
get along without you.

22:02.291 --> 22:04.166
You should go back.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.500
Uh, I think I need to sit down.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.959
Yeah, okay. Excuse us.

22:12.166 --> 22:13.291
[scoffing]

22:13.291 --> 22:16.834
"It's devastating. Devastating."

22:16.834 --> 22:19.834
I mean, uh, I don't get it.
What does Dan see in her?

22:19.834 --> 22:23.625
Her flawless, protruding
breasts? I don't know.

22:23.625 --> 22:25.542
I want to punch him.

22:25.542 --> 22:29.000
Hey, I, uh, appreciate the save.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.291
What save?

22:30.291 --> 22:32.000
If you hadn't come up
when you did

22:32.000 --> 22:34.667
I would've made a complete
fool of myself with Dan. Huh.

22:34.667 --> 22:36.792
You were going to tell him
how you really feel?

22:36.792 --> 22:40.542
That you wanted to be
more than friends?

22:40.542 --> 22:42.875
- I-I don't know.
- You don't know?

22:42.875 --> 22:44.959
I have no idea what was going
to come out of my mouth.

22:44.959 --> 22:46.959
I-I do miss, Dan.

22:46.959 --> 22:48.458
And then there's
this stupid competition

22:48.458 --> 22:50.708
we're not having.

22:50.708 --> 22:52.834
Whatever I said would've been
a complete disaster

22:52.834 --> 22:55.625
and I'm lucky you stopped me.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.500
That was really honest.

22:58.500 --> 23:00.166
Thank you.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.208
Dan and I work as friends.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.708
'That's what I want.'

23:08.708 --> 23:10.917
That's all I want.

23:12.917 --> 23:15.417
And I'm sorry
he's with someone else.

23:15.417 --> 23:19.041
I wish he were with you,
making you happy.

23:19.041 --> 23:21.083
Don't count me out yet.

23:21.083 --> 23:23.375
Come on, he's with someone.

23:23.375 --> 23:24.708
For now.

23:24.708 --> 23:25.875
Now, if you'll excuse me

23:25.875 --> 23:28.291
I have to pass out the nibbles.

23:34.708 --> 23:37.250
♪ Tonight candle light... ♪

23:37.250 --> 23:39.041
Hey, see that girl over there

23:39.041 --> 23:41.667
in the blue dress?

23:41.667 --> 23:43.708
You want to make a quick 40?

23:43.708 --> 23:46.250
- No, make that 50.
- Um, sure.

23:46.250 --> 23:49.083
Just get her talking
about shorebirds, okay?

23:49.083 --> 23:50.250
Okay.

23:51.917 --> 23:55.208
♪ What if there's no goodbye ♪♪

23:55.208 --> 23:58.083

23:58.083 --> 24:00.750
I spilled on my uniform. Yeah.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.750
Yeah, lucky for me,
I had this dress in my car.

24:03.750 --> 24:06.417
Just think of me
as a stealth waiter.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.375
- Come back here.
- Sorry, Wanda.

24:08.375 --> 24:11.291
Those guests
are looking really thirsty.

24:11.291 --> 24:13.708
Wanda? We need to fix the cake.

24:13.708 --> 24:16.417
My mother's new boyfriend
is allergic to dairy.

24:16.417 --> 24:19.417
It's buttercream icing.
You know, let's get you a drink.

24:19.417 --> 24:22.750
Have you ever had
a mood-stabilizer martini?

24:22.750 --> 24:24.583
- No.
- 'Oh, they're great.'

24:24.583 --> 24:27.417
Come on. Give me
something with everything.

24:27.417 --> 24:31.291
We moved the bird
to a second clean pan.

24:31.291 --> 24:34.458
Now, there we have
this special spa nozzle

24:34.458 --> 24:36.667
that propels the water
at sufficient pressure.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.250
Uh, cheers.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.959
Hey, Dan.

24:39.959 --> 24:41.458
Mr. Patch,
it's good to see you again.

24:41.458 --> 24:44.083
The pleasure's mine.
And call me James.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.458
Yes.

24:45.458 --> 24:47.667
Uh, Savannah,
these are my cousins--

24:47.667 --> 24:49.417
Michael, Chris and Frank.

24:49.417 --> 24:51.792
'And Michael's wife, Casey,
Chris' girlfriend, Jill'

24:51.792 --> 24:53.166
'and Frank's wife, Kimmie.'

24:53.166 --> 24:54.834
Incidentally,
congratulations, Kimmie.

24:54.834 --> 24:57.166
It's impossible to tell
you had a baby six months ago.

24:57.166 --> 25:00.792
- Uh, thank you.
- Oh, you're good.

25:00.792 --> 25:04.834
[chuckling]
Yeah, uh, Dan would pull out
a photo album from time to time

25:04.834 --> 25:06.750
'and I have a good memory
for faces.'

25:09.333 --> 25:11.250
(James)
'So anyway, uh...'

25:12.625 --> 25:14.000
Whoosh!

25:14.000 --> 25:15.041
Dry.

25:15.041 --> 25:17.625
It's very impressive.

25:17.625 --> 25:19.875
Now, we don't normally condone
the use of leg bands--

25:19.875 --> 25:21.041
- Okay.
- But in some--

25:21.041 --> 25:22.375
This isn't worth it.

25:22.375 --> 25:24.375
She can keep her 50 bucks.

25:24.375 --> 25:27.792
We never expected Mikey
to ever get married.

25:30.875 --> 25:32.667
Uh, Dan, could we go outside?

25:32.667 --> 25:34.500
I just need to talk to you.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.208
Dan?

25:36.208 --> 25:37.708
Who is this person?

25:37.708 --> 25:39.333
Oh, you-you met her
a little while ago.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.792
No, I mean, who is she to you?

25:41.792 --> 25:44.208
She just paid some guy
$50 to ask me questions

25:44.208 --> 25:47.000
'about the shorebird
rescue project.'

25:47.875 --> 25:50.000
Do you deny it?

25:54.667 --> 25:56.875
I think it's time
to cut the cake.

25:56.875 --> 25:58.875
Except for those
who are lactose intolerant.

25:58.875 --> 26:01.708
Yes, dear. Uh, Savannah,
we are running low on plates.

26:01.708 --> 26:03.375
Be a darling and go grab some.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.208
Alright, come on.
Let's go. Come on.

26:05.208 --> 26:08.625
I would like to know
what the hell's going on here.

26:08.625 --> 26:11.208
- 'Come on, everybody.'
- Uh-uh.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.250
I'm assuming
you didn't invite Savannah?

26:13.250 --> 26:15.708
No. No, I have no idea
why she's here.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.583
No idea? Really?

26:17.583 --> 26:20.417
I thought you were the smart one
in the family.

26:20.417 --> 26:25.041
Figure she wants to talk to me,
make me explain myself.

26:25.041 --> 26:27.917
It's a conversation
I'm not anxious to have.

26:27.917 --> 26:31.583
- Hurt her pretty bad, huh?
- Yeah.

26:31.583 --> 26:34.375
So you brought the bird woman
of Lake Pontchartrain along

26:34.375 --> 26:37.250
as what, a human shield?

26:37.250 --> 26:40.917
I thought having a date along
would keep my head straight

26:40.917 --> 26:43.208
keep me from doing
something stupid.

26:43.208 --> 26:45.458
Any of this
got something to do with Marti?

26:45.458 --> 26:46.583
How?

26:46.583 --> 26:48.250
She didn't wanna show up today.

26:48.250 --> 26:50.083
Wanda came to me
with some cock-and-bull story

26:50.083 --> 26:51.250
about stage fright.

26:51.250 --> 26:53.959
Stage fright? Marti? Come on.

26:53.959 --> 26:56.291
- I played along.
- Yeah.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.750
Yeah, things got a little weird
between us before I left.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.583
Broke up with Savannah
because of it.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.959
Marti.

27:05.959 --> 27:08.417
- My, my.
- What?

27:08.417 --> 27:11.458
I love that girl as a daughter,
but she is a bad fit for you.

27:11.458 --> 27:14.125
- Why?
- She's a train wreck.

27:14.125 --> 27:17.750
- You're a train wreck.
- Thank you, dad.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.792
I say that with love.

27:19.792 --> 27:21.417
I mean, two train wrecks
are exciting to watch

27:21.417 --> 27:23.458
but people get hurt.

27:23.458 --> 27:25.125
You need a girl like your mom

27:25.125 --> 27:28.291
somebody to call you
on your crap.

27:28.291 --> 27:30.458
You know how I knew
your mother was the one?

27:30.458 --> 27:32.458
She made me try harder.

27:32.458 --> 27:34.291
She made me
want to be a better person

27:34.291 --> 27:36.583
and believe that I could be.

27:36.583 --> 27:39.083
When you were seeing Savannah,
I saw a little of that

27:39.083 --> 27:41.291
saw you behaving
like a grown-up.

27:41.291 --> 27:43.166
It's a good color on you,
my son.

27:43.166 --> 27:44.667
If you're trying
to make me feel worse

27:44.667 --> 27:47.458
about screwing up
with her...it's working.

27:47.458 --> 27:50.333
Good. Then my fatherly work here
is done.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.125
Oh, and, uh, ahem, are you aware

27:52.125 --> 27:56.125
that Vicky, uh,
cleaned up 276 shorebirds?

27:56.125 --> 27:58.750
Yeah, that may have come up
once or twice.

28:01.959 --> 28:03.458
[sighing]

28:06.125 --> 28:07.792
[chuckling]
You're still not dressed?

28:07.792 --> 28:12.333
Uh, neither one of these
feels quite...right.

28:12.333 --> 28:15.000
Honey, you're gonna
look gorgeous in either one.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Hm.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.166
Okay, so I printed out
the, uh, online form

28:19.166 --> 28:21.500
for our marriage license,
now, I filled in most of it

28:21.500 --> 28:25.000
but I wasn't exactly sure
what to put here.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.333
Do you plan
on changing your name?

28:27.333 --> 28:29.208
Oh, I hadn't thought about it.

28:29.208 --> 28:33.208
Well, I'm-I'm okay
with whatever you want to do.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.250
I'll keep it, then.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.542
Honey, what's wrong?

28:39.542 --> 28:43.041
- I'm nervous.
- It's perfectly natural.

28:43.041 --> 28:44.375
Alright, listen.

28:44.375 --> 28:47.875
All you have to do
is sign on the dotted line

28:47.875 --> 28:50.542
and, I promise you,
I will fill out all the rest.

28:50.542 --> 28:51.959
Yeah.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.166
[sighing]

29:09.166 --> 29:11.542
I'm sorry, uh, Derrick. I...

29:11.542 --> 29:13.417
It's okay. It's okay.

29:13.417 --> 29:15.917
Just take a breath.

29:15.917 --> 29:18.291
You know, I'm sure all brides
get nervous on the day--

29:18.291 --> 29:21.458
Well, I just thought that
I'd have more time to be sure.

29:21.458 --> 29:22.792
About what?

29:25.083 --> 29:26.500
About us.

29:30.583 --> 29:32.375
Oh.

29:34.625 --> 29:36.125
Okay.

29:37.458 --> 29:39.041
Okay.

29:42.125 --> 29:43.375
I see.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.834
Is it Red Raymond?

29:54.792 --> 29:56.708
I'm sorry.

29:58.959 --> 30:00.458
Oh, wow.

30:04.959 --> 30:07.834
Yeah, he warned me.

30:10.125 --> 30:11.458
Look, it's, it's my fault.

30:11.458 --> 30:13.000
Blame me. It's my fault.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.625
No. No, I'm not gonna blame you.

30:16.625 --> 30:19.166
And I'm not gonna blow up at you
and storm of here

30:19.166 --> 30:24.250
like some child. That's not
how I want this to end.

30:24.250 --> 30:28.166
All I ever wanted
was to make you happy.

30:28.166 --> 30:31.375
That's it, and I'm so sorry
that I couldn't do that.

30:33.125 --> 30:36.083
But I still love you, Vanessa...

30:37.458 --> 30:39.750
...and I always will.

30:40.875 --> 30:42.333
Alright.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.500
Just, uh...

30:44.500 --> 30:46.458
...tell Red
that I said congratulations.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.792
And I wish you two
the very best.

30:55.375 --> 30:58.333
[instrumental music]

31:01.834 --> 31:03.625
[sobbing]

31:09.291 --> 31:11.667
It was awful.

31:11.667 --> 31:13.000
I don't know
what I would've done

31:13.000 --> 31:15.208
if your mom hadn't stepped in.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.875
Is there something
wrong with me, Marti?

31:19.875 --> 31:23.625
The fact that I'd want
Dan back after what he...

31:24.750 --> 31:27.041
What you guys did?

31:28.792 --> 31:31.166
You're a wonderful person
with love and forgiveness

- Yeah.

take the blame.

getting away with it.

think this was your fault.

35:07.792 --> 35:09.417
Why?

I could guilt you
into coming back to visit again.
