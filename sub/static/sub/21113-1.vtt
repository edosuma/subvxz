This is totally different.

about the word "punani."

- The article specifically says
"Don't call it your punani."

05:06.940 --> 05:09.710
- Understood, but in the past,
we've been criticized

05:09.743 --> 05:11.712
by a small but very vocal
Indian group

05:11.745 --> 05:12.813

I'd rather swap it out
and avoid any kind of backlash.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.903
We think this will have
a huge social-media reach.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.905
- Unfortunately,
it's a moot point.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.708
The artist initially agreed
to let us run her photographs,

05:40.741 --> 05:42.843

to pull out?

Okay, I just--I think this story
is worth fighting for.

of political.

rabbit hole.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.858
What's wrong with her?

08:44.892 --> 08:46.660

all of my ideas.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.629
- She didn't hate them.
- Oh, no, she was just

08:48.662 --> 08:50.631
fascinated by how boring
they were.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.766

I heard Jacqueline tell Lauren

for something

We can talk about Kat's

- Yeah.

- I'm gonna persuade that artist
to be in the magazine.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.819

I would let it go.

09:11.852 --> 09:12.886
Lauren was not happy today.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.087

she's threatened

with ambition.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.057

wasn't happy either.

with the interruption,

09:18.926 --> 09:22.863

to go after that story.

as confident as her.

How did she get to be
so confident?

this is about?

and wait.

I'm so incredibly sorry, sir.

This is probably
the weirdest thing

- You can call me Carl.
- Hi, Carl.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.666
- How about I get out
and see if his name

did I spend

with him?

- Mm, honey...
- It's okay. It's okay.

There's no need
to be melodramatic.

that you said "I love you" to.

It's okay to not be fine.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.515
I think that I could handle
bigger subject matter,

19:42.549 --> 19:45.618
and I want to prove it,
so I have some ideas

19:45.652 --> 19:46.819

to throw at you.

might be there with him?

are good enough

on panties,

with something?

21:45.672 --> 21:46.839
So tell me, Kat,

21:46.873 --> 21:48.375
have I misunderstood you?

21:48.408 --> 21:49.842
- I'm a feminist, okay?

21:49.876 --> 21:52.645
I'm political,
and so is this magazine.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.481
- It's about clothes and makeup

21:54.514 --> 21:55.882

- I dare you to tell that
to Jacqueline.

You know, when she took over
the magazine,

21:59.652 --> 22:00.820
she shifted the focus.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.389
She calls it
stealth feminism.

in my country,

22:37.557 --> 22:38.925

is repressive...

to do this anymore."

26:58.951 --> 27:01.020
*

27:01.053 --> 27:03.289
- I hope your friends back home
appreciate the contraband.

27:03.322 --> 27:04.857
- They will.
- [laughs]

27:04.891 --> 27:07.760
- Can I ask you
a personal question?

27:07.794 --> 27:09.996
- Uh, I don't know
what the signals are like

27:10.029 --> 27:12.765
in your culture,
but in mine,

27:12.799 --> 27:15.735
when we spend an evening helping
someone take apart vibrators

27:15.768 --> 27:17.269
to smuggle
into a foreign country,

27:17.303 --> 27:20.172
it's a pretty good indicator
that it's okay to get personal.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.942
- What's your
sexual orientation?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.877
*

27:24.911 --> 27:27.780
- Out and proud hetero.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.816
Sorry.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.851
- It wasn't a come-on.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.753
- Oh, it would be okay
if it was.

27:33.786 --> 27:34.787
I could do worse,

27:34.821 --> 27:36.723
and, you know, honestly,

27:36.756 --> 27:39.091
I actually really get
the whole girl thing.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.092
I do.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.028
But, you know, for me,

27:42.061 --> 27:45.264
I could just never get past...

27:45.297 --> 27:47.266
this.

27:47.299 --> 27:51.003
- Well, for me, it's never
just been about...

27:51.037 --> 27:53.873
"this."

27:53.906 --> 27:55.975
It's, uh...

27:56.008 --> 27:58.978
it's more about this.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.279
- Damn it.

28:00.312 --> 28:03.282
Never really been much
of a boobs girl either.

28:05.885 --> 28:08.821
- You use humor to hide
your real emotions.

28:08.855 --> 28:11.958
- Oh, okay.
All right.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.960
Hey, I'm gonna ask you
a personal question.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.963
- Okay.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.965
- Why do you still wear
a hijab?

28:18.998 --> 28:23.002
Isn't it
kind of contradictory?

28:23.035 --> 28:26.272
- I choose to wear the hijab.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.875
It does not oppress me...

28:28.908 --> 28:30.877
but liberates me

28:30.910 --> 28:33.345
from society's expectations

28:33.379 --> 28:35.915
of what a woman
should look like.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.383
People tend to get uncomfortable

28:37.416 --> 28:40.286
when they cannot put you
in a box.

28:40.319 --> 28:45.357
But I've always liked
to make people uncomfortable.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.861
- Well, you're
very good at it.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.262
- * Every night
you're saying prayers *

28:50.296 --> 28:53.065
[both chuckle]

28:53.099 --> 28:56.035
[cell phone vibrating, ringing]

28:56.068 --> 28:58.170
- [clears throat]

28:58.204 --> 28:59.806
Oh, sorry, I should--

28:59.839 --> 29:01.941
I should take this.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.910
Jane?

29:03.943 --> 29:06.412
- At first, I was calling
because Sutton lied to me,

29:06.445 --> 29:08.948
and I'm worried about her,

29:08.981 --> 29:11.884
but now I'm calling
because I'm drunk

29:11.918 --> 29:13.920
and I might puke
and I need you to come

29:13.953 --> 29:15.121
and hold my hair back.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.388
- I'm on my way.

29:16.422 --> 29:19.125
*

29:19.158 --> 29:20.993
I'm sorry, I, uh,

29:21.027 --> 29:22.161
kind of have to go.

29:22.194 --> 29:25.064
- Well, it's been very nice

29:25.097 --> 29:27.233
packing contraband with you,

29:27.266 --> 29:29.936
Kat Edison.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.939
- Yeah, you too,
Adena El-Amin.

29:32.972 --> 29:40.012
*

29:41.180 --> 29:44.884
* Don't go

29:44.917 --> 29:47.920
- Kat?

29:47.954 --> 29:48.988
- * Don't go

29:49.021 --> 29:51.958
- You can run the article.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.025
- Okay.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.261
- * Don't go on me now

29:55.294 --> 29:57.029
- Thanks.

29:57.063 --> 29:59.899
*

29:59.932 --> 30:01.133
- I have no idea
why she lied to me,

30:01.167 --> 30:03.169
but she seriously
saved my ass last night.

30:03.202 --> 30:06.105
I was about three seconds
from drunk-dialing Eric.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.306
- Kind of wish you had.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.976
I like the idea of angry Jane.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.277
- Are you sure
this is the right place?

30:11.310 --> 30:14.080
- Yeah. This is the building.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.948
- Swanky.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.918
[dramatic music]

30:18.951 --> 30:20.920
- Oh, my God.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.990
*

30:24.023 --> 30:27.259
Oh, my God.

30:27.293 --> 30:34.333
*

30:44.310 --> 30:46.045
- You guys followed me?
- We have each other's

30:46.078 --> 30:48.280
"Find My Friends" for a reason.
- Yeah, in case one of us

30:48.314 --> 30:50.016
gets blackout drunk
and/or roofied.

30:50.049 --> 30:52.284
- How could you not
tell us that you're having sex

30:52.318 --> 30:53.886
with Richard Hunter?
- 'Cause she's being an idiot.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.521
- I've been dying
to tell you guys everything,

30:55.554 --> 30:58.424
but he's a board member.
This is a huge risk for him.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.459
If this ever got out,
it would be--

31:00.492 --> 31:03.429
- No, if this gets out,
Richard will be absolutely fine.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.131
Uh, he'll probably get
a pat on the back

31:05.164 --> 31:06.665
from the rest of the board.

31:06.698 --> 31:09.368
You're the one who's gonna
get trashed, Sutton.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.437
We all know what everyone
at "Scarlet" calls this,

31:11.470 --> 31:13.372
sleeping with an older man
with money, you're--

31:13.405 --> 31:15.407
- Screwing up?
You think I'm screwing up?

31:15.441 --> 31:17.143
- I don't think that, Sutton.
- First of all...

31:17.176 --> 31:20.146
I can screw whoever I want.

31:20.179 --> 31:25.017
And second of all, that's not
even what this is, Kat.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.920
I like him.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.523
What? A guy like that would
never go for a girl like me?

31:31.557 --> 31:32.959
- That's not what we're saying.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.460
- Do you realize
how insane it is

31:34.493 --> 31:35.394
that you used an app
to stalk me?

31:35.427 --> 31:37.463
[cell phone ringing]

31:37.496 --> 31:38.965
- Okay, well, I called you--
- Just give me one second.

31:38.998 --> 31:40.466
I needed you,
and you lied to me.

31:40.499 --> 31:41.600
[both speaking at once]

31:41.633 --> 31:44.370
- Firuze?
Okay, slow down.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.504
- Okay, well, I'm sorry--
- I would never do that to you.

31:45.537 --> 31:46.572
- Guys, shut up.
Shut up.

31:46.605 --> 31:47.639
Adena's been detained

31:47.673 --> 31:49.475
at the airport back home.

31:49.508 --> 31:53.345
They found one of the vibrators
in her luggage.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.347
Hello?
Yeah, I'm here.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.349
They're supposed to take
the contraband and let her go,

31:57.383 --> 31:59.151
but they've been holding her
for hours,

31:59.185 --> 32:02.454
and they won't let Firuze
or anyone else talk to her.

32:02.488 --> 32:03.956
- Well, does she have a lawyer
over there?

32:03.990 --> 32:06.425
- No. that's why Firuze
called me.

32:06.458 --> 32:09.461
She was hoping, you know,
that maybe I could help,

32:09.495 --> 32:13.499
but, uh, I just have no idea
who to call.

32:13.532 --> 32:16.202
- Um, Evan.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.437
Get Janice O'Hare
on the phone.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.106
I have a friend
at the State Department.

32:20.139 --> 32:25.677
*

32:25.711 --> 32:29.481
- Hey, I got the rundown
on what Adena's up against.

32:29.515 --> 32:30.582
- Okay.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.651
- Okay, there's some
legal document

32:32.684 --> 32:34.987
that she has to sign,
but the gist is this--

32:35.021 --> 32:39.058
she has to admit that she's
deeply ashamed of her crime.

32:39.091 --> 32:42.661
- Well, Adena would never
sign that, so...

32:42.694 --> 32:44.196
- Kat, she's got to sign it,

32:44.230 --> 32:45.697
or else they're not gonna
let her go.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.166
There's strict punishment

32:47.199 --> 32:48.567
for women
who choose to defy them.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.737
- Oh, really? Okay.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.239
Well, then I guess I'll just
have to show them

32:53.272 --> 32:55.774
a woman defying them.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.676
Listen up, everyone.
Stop what you're doing.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.511
We are going to tweet

32:59.545 --> 33:01.780
that a woman is being held
against her will

33:01.813 --> 33:04.583
simply for wanting to own
her own sexuality.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.053
#FreeAdena, unless someone
has something better.

33:07.086 --> 33:10.156
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.
Nobody is tweeting anything.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.158
Kat, my office.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.792
- I am the social-media
director, okay?

33:13.825 --> 33:15.594
I'm tweeting this.

33:15.627 --> 33:18.764
- Have you even considered
what this could do to Adena?

33:18.797 --> 33:21.433
Putting attention on it?
Shaming them?

33:21.467 --> 33:24.236
God, Kat,
just think it through

33:24.270 --> 33:26.438
before you open your mouth.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.441
*

33:29.475 --> 33:32.811
[keys tapping]

33:32.844 --> 33:34.046
What are you doing?

[tapping continues]

33:36.682 --> 33:38.184
[cell phone whistles]

33:38.217 --> 33:40.786
*

33:40.819 --> 33:42.554
Get me
into "Scarlet's" Twitter.

33:42.588 --> 33:46.625
We need to delete
whatever she just posted.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.828
[dramatic music]

33:49.861 --> 33:54.233
*

33:54.266 --> 33:55.734
- It's funny.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.203
- Kat, where are you going?

33:57.236 --> 33:58.770
- I don't know, okay?

33:58.804 --> 34:01.607
I don't know. I just--
I need to go to the consulate.

34:01.640 --> 34:05.177
Or--or call the--

34:05.211 --> 34:07.213
I don't know. I just--
I need to do something.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.714
- There's nothing
you can do.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.849
- Hey, hey, it's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.485
- They could send her
to jail forever,

34:13.519 --> 34:15.287
or worse, and it is
completely my fault.

34:15.321 --> 34:17.756
- Hey, it is not your fault.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.226
- Yes, it is.
I gave her the vibrators.

34:20.259 --> 34:23.162
It was my idea to smuggle
them in, all because I...

34:23.195 --> 34:24.496
[exhales shakily]

34:24.530 --> 34:26.332
I just--I--
I need to fix this.

34:26.365 --> 34:28.334
- No, what you need to do
right now is just scream.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.136
When I was a kid
in Colorado,

34:30.169 --> 34:31.570
I used to just hike up
to the mountains and scream.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.305
Just let it out.

34:33.339 --> 34:34.773
- Well, that is
a beautiful story, Jane,

34:34.806 --> 34:37.209
but unfortunately,
this is not Colorado.

34:37.243 --> 34:40.212
This is New York City,
and there is literally nowhere

34:40.246 --> 34:44.516
in this entire city where people
aren't always on top of you!

34:44.550 --> 34:46.318
Excuse me, sir, thank you.

34:46.352 --> 34:48.720
*

34:48.754 --> 34:50.322
- Shut up!

34:50.356 --> 34:51.723
*

34:51.757 --> 34:53.759
- No, no, no, this is perfect.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.228
We just found the one place in
New York where you can scream.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.130
- Oh, my God, Jane.
Please stop.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.531
- Hey, we're just trying
to help you.

34:59.565 --> 35:01.300
- What are you gonna do
to help, Sutton?

35:01.333 --> 35:03.135
Are you gonna call
your boyfriend

35:03.169 --> 35:04.670
and see if maybe he can fix
the problem for me?

35:04.703 --> 35:06.272
- * Can't stop me now

35:06.305 --> 35:08.140
- I got to go.
- You know what?

35:08.174 --> 35:10.142
If she wants to
go through this alone,

35:10.176 --> 35:11.277
let her.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.578
*

35:12.611 --> 35:15.814
- * Ah-ooh, oh-oh oh-oh-oh

35:15.847 --> 35:18.917

35:18.950 --> 35:20.586
- Hello, Jane.
- Jacqueline.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.554
I'm so sorry, I didn't realize
you were in here.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.556
I'll get out of your way.
- I just wasn't feeling

35:24.590 --> 35:25.824
these shoes
sent over for the gala,

35:25.857 --> 35:27.293
but it seems like you
need this closet

35:27.326 --> 35:29.161
a lot more than I do.
- No, no, no.

35:29.195 --> 35:31.797
Uh, don't wear shoes
you don't like because of me.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.165
Just forget I was here.

35:33.199 --> 35:34.700
- Jane.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.768
What is going on with you?
- Um, nothing.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.338
- I felt very confident
giving you this promotion,

35:39.371 --> 35:41.573
but your energy this week
has been off.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.175
Maybe you're not quite ready.
- No.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.177
I am.
I'm ready.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.613
And I'm so grateful
for this opportunity.

35:47.646 --> 35:48.880
- Good.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.417
I'm glad to hear that.

35:51.450 --> 35:54.420
So when am I gonna get
some material from you?

35:54.453 --> 35:56.188
- Soon. It's all there.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.756
Well, I found Eric.

35:57.789 --> 36:01.427
I, um--I'm just having trouble
finishing it.

36:01.460 --> 36:04.830
- How can we fix that, then?

36:04.863 --> 36:06.898
- Well, I guess
I-I need to talk to him.

36:06.932 --> 36:09.201
- Well, that sounds like
a pretty good guess to me.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.436
Why haven't you done that?

36:13.905 --> 36:15.741
- Because it hurts too much.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.776
[door opens]

36:17.809 --> 36:20.379

- No shit, Andrew.

Tell her I'll call right back.

36:32.658 --> 36:33.892
So it's your choice
whether you want

36:33.925 --> 36:36.362
to go after
that ending or not,

36:36.395 --> 36:38.930
but I've never met anybody
who made a career happen

answer that, or...

I could show you.

38:43.489 --> 38:46.558
Our little magazine has gone
through quite a few changes

38:46.592 --> 38:48.427
over the past six decades,

38:48.460 --> 38:50.562
and for those of you who say
that we are still

38:50.596 --> 38:53.432
a fashion and beauty magazine,
I say yes.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.466
Yes, we are.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.535
But for those of you who say

38:56.568 --> 38:59.571
we are just  a fashion
and beauty magazine,

38:59.605 --> 39:02.574
I say, "Here's the next
great mascara

39:02.608 --> 39:05.377
"to give you bigger eyes
to see the world.

39:05.411 --> 39:07.145
"Here's a fabulous pair
of jeans.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.415

39:09.448 --> 39:12.451
A few years ago,
I read an application

39:12.484 --> 39:14.520
of a young intern,

39:14.553 --> 39:17.456
and her words have always
stayed with me.

39:17.489 --> 39:22.027
When asked why she wanted
to work at "Scarlet,"

39:22.060 --> 39:25.464
she said,
"Because when I needed it,

39:25.497 --> 39:28.033
"'Scarlet' was like
getting the advice

39:28.066 --> 39:32.604
of an older sister that
I'd always wished I'd had."

39:32.638 --> 39:34.139
No matter
how many years pass,

39:34.172 --> 39:37.509
no matter
how the world changes,

39:37.543 --> 39:42.147
"Scarlet" will always be
that older sister.

39:42.180 --> 39:45.451
And we will always be there
for the girls who need her.

39:45.484 --> 39:48.086

You are the women and men

39:59.765 --> 40:03.034
who work at "Scarlet,"

40:03.068 --> 40:06.204
and 60 years ago,
this magazine set out

40:06.237 --> 40:10.542
to redefine the rules.

40:10.576 --> 40:15.547
And now that responsibility
falls to each one of you.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.148
And I want to make sure
you understand

40:17.182 --> 40:20.452
what I expect of you.

40:20.486 --> 40:24.656
I expect you
to have adventures.

40:24.690 --> 40:28.059
I expect you to fall in love,

40:28.093 --> 40:30.195
to get your hearts broken.

with the right people,

40:37.803 --> 40:40.071
to make mistakes
and make amends,

40:40.105 --> 40:44.510
take a leap
and make a splash.

40:44.543 --> 40:46.612
And I expect you
to unleash holy hell

40:46.645 --> 40:48.780
on anybody who tries
to hold you back,

40:48.814 --> 40:53.051
because you don't just
work for "Scarlet."

40:53.084 --> 40:56.555
You are "Scarlet."
