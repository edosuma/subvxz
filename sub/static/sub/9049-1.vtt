00:35.439 --> 00:38.273
Whoo!

00:38.275 --> 00:40.208
What's up, Atlanta?

00:40.210 --> 00:41.977
Welcome to my comeback show.

00:41.979 --> 00:43.139
My first gig in three months.

00:43.161 --> 00:46.581
I want to thank Jimmy starr for changing
his mind and letting me perform again.

00:46.583 --> 00:47.583
Let's go.

02:02.391 --> 02:04.793
Austin! Austin! Austin!

02:04.795 --> 02:08.497
Austin. Austin. Austin.

02:08.499 --> 02:09.663
Austin!

02:10.900 --> 02:12.734
I brought you pancakes.

02:12.736 --> 02:13.835
Huh?

02:13.837 --> 02:15.337
It was just a dream.

02:15.339 --> 02:17.572
I know, right?

02:17.574 --> 02:20.575
My whole tour has been like
this one amazing dream.

02:22.612 --> 02:25.347
Yeah, that's what I meant.

03:23.472 --> 03:26.141
Surprise!

03:26.143 --> 03:28.043
You're not Austin and Ally.

03:28.045 --> 03:30.045
Nice to see you too.

03:30.754 --> 03:33.114
I thought you were still on tour
with that British boy band.

03:35.152 --> 03:38.720
I left Boynado in new York and flew
back here to surprise Austin and Ally.

03:38.722 --> 03:40.555
Well, I came all
the way from L.A.

03:40.557 --> 03:41.756
To surprise Austin and Ally.

03:41.758 --> 03:44.593
I've been hiding
here for three days.

03:45.506 --> 03:48.997
Apparently, you also haven't
brushed your teeth in three days.

03:48.999 --> 03:50.832
No. No, I have not.

03:51.834 --> 03:54.469
Look, I was here first, so I get
to surprise Austin and Ally.

03:54.471 --> 03:56.938
Okay, you can surprise them
after I surprise them.

03:56.940 --> 03:57.560
Dez? Trish?

03:57.591 --> 04:00.041
You guys didn't tell us
you were gonna be here.

04:00.043 --> 04:02.010
Guys, please, we're in
the middle of something.

04:02.012 --> 04:03.945
So when Austin and Ally
come in, I'm gonna...

04:09.552 --> 04:10.885
What are you guys doing here?

04:10.887 --> 04:12.621
We couldn't miss the
last night of your tour.

04:12.623 --> 04:14.422
Oh, it's so good to
see you guys again.

04:14.424 --> 04:16.124
It's like a breath of fresh air.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.094
- Nothing fresh about it.
- Mm-mm.

04:19.096 --> 04:21.129
Oh, come on. Whoo!

04:25.868 --> 04:28.080
This was such an amazing
summer, but I missed you so...

04:28.739 --> 04:30.905
Hang on, it's Boynado.

04:30.907 --> 04:31.940
Trish here.

04:31.942 --> 04:34.042
Uh-huh.

04:34.044 --> 04:36.611
Well, tell Nigel to give
Devon his hairbrush back.

04:38.481 --> 04:39.948
You were saying?

04:40.883 --> 04:42.951
And then, the gorilla
rips off his mask,

04:42.953 --> 04:46.221
and it turns out it was the kangaroo
committing all those crimes.

04:46.223 --> 04:48.223
Oh, and the diamonds
were in his pouch.

04:48.225 --> 04:50.091
- Yep.
- Wow.

04:50.093 --> 04:52.093
Huh, sounds like you're
doing great at film school.

04:52.095 --> 04:54.796
Yeah. In fact, now that we're
finished with the summer session,

04:54.798 --> 04:56.898
they gave me money to shoot
a movie here in Miami.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.967
That's awesome!

04:58.969 --> 05:00.235
Hey, how's it going
with you and Carrie?

05:00.237 --> 05:01.870
Oh, couldn't be better.

05:01.872 --> 05:04.005
Her modeling career
is really taking off.

05:04.007 --> 05:07.108
Check it out. She's the new
face of Aqua Smile Toothpaste.

05:08.644 --> 05:11.680
No way! Carrie's the new
is-there-something-in-my-teeth girl?

05:11.682 --> 05:12.981
Yeah.

05:12.983 --> 05:14.983
So how's it going
with what's-her-face?

05:16.052 --> 05:17.619
You mean Ally?

05:18.888 --> 05:20.155
Oh, it's been incredible.

05:20.157 --> 05:21.656
She's the best.

05:21.658 --> 05:23.525
It's like, every day
we spend together...

05:23.527 --> 05:26.227
is like the best day ever,

05:26.229 --> 05:29.197
except that the day before
was just as amazing,

05:29.199 --> 05:33.234
and I know that the next day is
gonna be just as amazing too.

05:33.236 --> 05:37.972
So, I guess you could say that every
day is tied for the best day ever.

05:37.974 --> 05:39.574
I'm sorry, were you
saying something?

05:40.810 --> 05:42.510
Nope.

05:42.512 --> 05:46.114
Anyway, how's Austin been dealing
with the whole not-performing thing?

05:47.049 --> 05:48.083
You know what?

05:49.018 --> 05:52.787
He's great. He's totally happy just
hanging out behind the scenes.

05:52.789 --> 05:56.157
I mean, I'm totally happy for
Ally, but it's really hard for me

05:56.159 --> 05:57.959
just hanging out
behind the scenes.

05:59.295 --> 06:02.063
Austin doesn't even think
about playing music anymore.

06:02.065 --> 06:04.566
All I ever think about
is playing music.

06:06.035 --> 06:09.070
You know, I'm kind of sad that
tonight's the last show of the tour.

06:09.072 --> 06:12.540
I gotta be honest, I'm kind of happy that
tonight's the last show of the tour.

06:13.430 --> 06:14.751
So, I guess what
I'm saying is...

06:15.545 --> 06:18.046
Hang on. Boynado is
driving me crazy.

06:19.548 --> 06:21.149
So, I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

06:21.151 --> 06:23.051
Hang on, Boynado's
driving me crazy.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.986
I can't get their
song out of my head.

06:31.060 --> 06:32.193
Love that song.

06:37.901 --> 06:39.234
Thank you, Miami!

06:40.269 --> 06:43.772
This show is extra special to me,
because this is my hometown.

06:44.975 --> 06:46.141
And because...

06:46.143 --> 06:47.709
My best friends are all here.

06:53.115 --> 06:54.816
This song is called
no place like home.

08:35.116 --> 08:36.251
Thank you.

08:38.755 --> 08:41.422
Remember when you used to
play concerts like this?

08:41.424 --> 08:44.058
Ugh, must be frustrating
to know that Jimmy Starr

08:44.059 --> 08:45.960
will never let you
perform again.

08:45.962 --> 08:48.696
Dez, can you please
stop talking?

08:48.698 --> 08:50.698
Not only is what you're
saying very upsetting,

08:50.700 --> 08:52.934
but your breath is
melting my face.

08:54.169 --> 08:55.136
Hey, guys.

08:55.138 --> 08:56.471
- Ally!
- Great show.

08:56.473 --> 08:58.072
You killed it.

08:58.074 --> 09:00.141
I am so glad you guys
are here with me.

09:00.143 --> 09:03.177
Now that the tour's over, it's gonna be
nice for things to go back to normal.

09:03.179 --> 09:05.113
I'm really looking forward
to going back to school.

09:05.115 --> 09:06.314
- Really?
- Say what?

09:06.316 --> 09:08.116
I'm confused.

09:08.118 --> 09:09.784
I'm excited to go back to school

09:09.786 --> 09:12.213
because the four of us get to
spend our senior year together.

09:12.244 --> 09:14.389
Hey, I came up with a
cool nickname for us:

09:14.391 --> 09:16.224
The fearsome foursome.

09:19.955 --> 09:22.196
If you don't like it, we can
come up with something else.

09:22.198 --> 09:24.065
It's not that.

09:24.067 --> 09:27.902
Well, it is that, but also,
I'm not going back to school.

09:27.904 --> 09:29.070
- What?
- Really?

09:29.072 --> 09:30.505
Finally kicked you out?

09:30.507 --> 09:34.042
I'm getting my diploma online, so I
can go back on the road with Boynado.

09:34.044 --> 09:35.209
- Oh.
- Congrats.

09:35.211 --> 09:37.145
Cool.

09:37.147 --> 09:38.379
What?

09:40.249 --> 09:43.084
Well, at least we're all
still gonna be together,

09:43.086 --> 09:45.219
the fearsome threesome.

09:46.422 --> 09:48.790
Dude, you know I'm going back to L.A.
for film school.

09:48.792 --> 09:49.499
What?

09:49.530 --> 09:52.327
But you said you were
making a film in Miami.

09:52.329 --> 09:53.995
Yeah, a short film.

09:53.997 --> 09:55.396
It's called, Ally
performs in Miami.

09:55.398 --> 09:56.864
I just finished it.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.969
My plan was always just to be here
for a few days, then head back.

10:00.971 --> 10:02.170
Oh.

10:02.172 --> 10:03.471
Don't be sad, bud.

10:03.473 --> 10:05.173
Because then you'll make me sad.

10:13.015 --> 10:15.049
I'm bummed Dez and Trish
aren't gonna be with us,

10:15.051 --> 10:18.786
but at least I get to spend my
senior year with my girlfriend.

10:18.788 --> 10:20.855
The fearsome twosome.

10:20.857 --> 10:24.058
I mean, unless you're gonna tell me
that you're jetting off to Switzerland.

10:25.928 --> 10:27.289
You're jetting off
to Switzerland?

10:28.330 --> 10:31.132
Ronnie Ramone called
me before the show.

10:31.134 --> 10:34.936
The tour did so well that he
booked me a European tour.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.038
It... starts next week.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.874
What about school?
You love school.

10:41.111 --> 10:42.543
This is Ronnie now.

10:44.013 --> 10:45.179
Sorry, Austin.

10:49.918 --> 10:51.552
Ronnie, hey.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.192
Well...

10:58.194 --> 11:01.195
I guess now it's just
the fearsome onesome.

11:13.276 --> 11:16.845
Hey, instead of being sad about
everyone going their separate ways,

11:16.847 --> 11:19.348
let's talk about the next
time we can get together.

11:19.350 --> 11:22.150
I'm free pretty much every
day, except, like...

11:22.152 --> 11:23.919
No. I'm free always.

11:25.355 --> 11:27.389
How about the first
weekend of October?

11:27.391 --> 11:29.257
Yep, works for me.

11:29.259 --> 11:30.592
I'm in Barcelona.

11:30.594 --> 11:31.626
How about the sixth?

11:31.628 --> 11:32.794
No, wait, I can't.

11:32.796 --> 11:33.895
How about the seventh?

11:33.897 --> 11:35.263
No, wait, I can't.

11:35.265 --> 11:37.165
The eighth? No, wait, I can't.

11:37.167 --> 11:38.333
The ninth?

11:38.335 --> 11:40.502
- No, wait, I can't.
- Okay, forget October.

11:40.504 --> 11:42.237
How about the first
weekend of November?

11:42.239 --> 11:43.271
Yep, works for me.

11:43.273 --> 11:44.373
I'm in Milan.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.341
Well, when do you
get back, Ally?

11:46.343 --> 11:48.343
Uh... Christmas.

11:48.345 --> 11:49.878
Oh, I can do Christmas.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.380
Oh, I can't.

11:51.382 --> 11:52.381
Oh, wait, I can.

11:52.383 --> 11:54.383
Great, so Christmas it is.

11:54.385 --> 11:55.584
Yay!

11:55.586 --> 11:56.852
That's kind of far away.

11:56.854 --> 11:58.520
You're right.

11:58.522 --> 12:01.390
Well, it'll be here
before you know it.

12:01.392 --> 12:03.325
Anyway, I got you guys
a little something.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.528
Matching backpacks.

12:06.530 --> 12:10.432
They were supposed to be for school,
but why let them go to waste?

12:10.434 --> 12:11.767
They all say "fearsome foursome"

12:11.769 --> 12:12.968
and have our names on them.

12:15.705 --> 12:17.973
Oh, how come mine says "Trish"?

12:19.442 --> 12:21.276
Because that one's not yours.

12:21.278 --> 12:22.411
Oh.

12:22.413 --> 12:24.346
Oh, cool. Mine says "Ally."

12:33.322 --> 12:34.923
Mom, can I talk to you a sec?

12:34.925 --> 12:35.991
Hang on.

12:38.294 --> 12:40.796
This mattress is supposed to
have a jump factor of 80,

12:40.798 --> 12:42.664
and I'm only getting 63.

12:44.434 --> 12:45.867
That's... horrible?

12:45.869 --> 12:47.235
Yeah.

12:49.338 --> 12:50.639
Is everything okay?

12:50.641 --> 12:51.840
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:52.775 --> 12:54.509
I guess I just have
a lot on my mind.

12:54.511 --> 12:56.278
Oh, honey.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.067
Come have a seat on this
relaxapedic memory foam

12:59.098 --> 13:01.713
comfort sleeper, and
tell mommy all about it.

13:03.386 --> 13:04.719
It's just...

13:04.721 --> 13:06.721
I'm really...

13:06.723 --> 13:08.523
Ooh, this is really comfortable.

13:08.525 --> 13:10.258
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

13:11.394 --> 13:16.832
Anyway... I was really looking forward
to senior year with my best friends,

13:16.834 --> 13:19.034
and now I'm gonna be going
to school all by myself.

13:19.036 --> 13:22.471
Sounds like someone's
mattress has lost its spring.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.440
I can't even make music anymore.

13:26.643 --> 13:30.345
When I was your age, I
felt exactly like you do.

13:30.347 --> 13:32.380
I was lost and directionless.

13:32.382 --> 13:34.282
My hair was losing its luster.

13:34.284 --> 13:36.051
Ugh, it was dried out,

13:36.053 --> 13:38.553
and brittle, and frizzy,
and I had split ends,

13:38.555 --> 13:41.167
and I was suffering from dry
scalp, and I was like...

13:41.198 --> 13:42.634
Can you please get to the point?

13:43.359 --> 13:46.361
The point is, is I needed
a change in my life,

13:46.363 --> 13:48.763
so I decided to go
to military school.

13:48.765 --> 13:50.499
You think I should go
to military school?

13:50.501 --> 13:52.467
Oh, it was the best
decision I ever made.

13:52.469 --> 13:55.094
I made great friends there,
and every weekend we had

13:55.125 --> 13:57.472
mixers with the kids from
the mattress academy.

13:57.474 --> 13:59.074
That's where I met your father.

14:00.977 --> 14:01.918
I don't know.

14:01.949 --> 14:05.680
Oh, military school can give
you the confidence, structure,

14:05.682 --> 14:07.349
and discipline your
life's missing.

14:08.084 --> 14:10.018
But did it fix your hair?

14:10.020 --> 14:11.486
You tell me.

14:12.455 --> 14:15.090
I should get back to work now.

14:20.029 --> 14:21.429
This week flew by.

14:21.431 --> 14:24.966
It feels like we all just got here,
and now we're saying goodbye again.

14:24.968 --> 14:27.869
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

14:27.871 --> 14:30.605
One of you much more
than the other.

14:30.607 --> 14:31.907
Sorry, Ally.

14:31.909 --> 14:33.875
Me and Trish just have
this special thing.

14:40.483 --> 14:41.683
Come on, Dez.

14:41.685 --> 14:45.086
You're going back to film school,
and Carrie's there waiting for you.

14:49.492 --> 14:50.959
She's not waiting for me.

14:51.928 --> 14:53.395
Carrie broke up with me.

14:53.397 --> 14:54.596
- What?
- Seriously?

14:54.598 --> 14:56.131
A month ago.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.799
I was too embarrassed
to tell anybody.

14:57.801 --> 15:00.802
I don't want to go back to L.A.
I lied, it wasn't fun.

15:00.804 --> 15:02.737
I was sad and lonely
there without you guys.

15:02.739 --> 15:05.707
Aw, Dez, I'm so sorry.

15:05.709 --> 15:08.476
I really thought you and Carrie
were so perfect for each other.

15:08.478 --> 15:09.878
Oh, don't you think I know that?

15:12.548 --> 15:13.682
Sorry.

15:15.418 --> 15:17.018
Since we're being honest...

15:17.020 --> 15:18.520
My summer touring with Boynado

15:18.522 --> 15:20.388
wasn't as great as I
made it sound either.

15:20.390 --> 15:22.958
Actually, you never
made it sound great.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.126
You pretty much just complained
about it the whole time.

15:25.128 --> 15:27.662
Well, those boys are
driving me nuts!

15:27.664 --> 15:29.531
"Rupert ate my cereal."

15:29.533 --> 15:31.066
"Nigel stole my trousers."

15:31.068 --> 15:33.702
"Stop mocking me, Trish."

15:33.704 --> 15:35.670
I miss just managing my friends.

15:37.006 --> 15:38.640
Honestly...

15:38.642 --> 15:41.543
I'm not that excited about
going back on tour.

15:41.545 --> 15:45.046
I'm gonna miss Austin, and I really was
looking forward to our senior year.

15:46.082 --> 15:49.084
Wait, why are we all going to
do things we don't want to do

15:49.086 --> 15:52.754
when we can stay here and enjoy
our senior year together?

15:52.756 --> 15:54.456
That's a great idea.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.458
So we're all staying in Miami?

15:57.560 --> 15:58.793
On three.

15:58.795 --> 16:00.262
One, two, three.

16:00.264 --> 16:01.563
- Senior year!
- Let's go manatees!

16:01.565 --> 16:02.631
We're staying in Miami!

16:05.434 --> 16:08.354
We probably should have planned what
we were gonna say before we did that.

16:09.472 --> 16:11.606
We have to tell Austin.
He's gonna be so excited.

16:13.776 --> 16:14.809
Oh, hey, Mrs. Moon.

16:14.811 --> 16:16.077
Hey, guys.

16:16.079 --> 16:18.680
Austin wanted me to
give you these letters.

16:18.682 --> 16:21.650
He said not to read them
until after I leave.

16:33.462 --> 16:36.064
Austin's going to
military school?

16:36.066 --> 16:38.800
He didn't have the heart
to say goodbye in person?

16:38.802 --> 16:40.235
He already left?

16:41.671 --> 16:43.238
"Dear Dez"?

16:51.981 --> 16:55.216
I can't believe Austin left for military
school without even saying goodbye.

16:55.218 --> 16:58.253
We have to get down there and stop
him before he's officially enrolled.

16:58.255 --> 16:59.554
Let's go.

17:00.857 --> 17:03.591
Dez, please do something
about your breath.

17:03.593 --> 17:05.727
It's like you have a dead
skunk in your mouth,

17:05.729 --> 17:08.696
and that skunk has another
dead skunk inside of his.

17:09.799 --> 17:12.067
I haven't brushed my teeth
since Carrie dumped me.

17:12.069 --> 17:14.035
Now that she's doing
ads for Aqua Smile,

17:14.970 --> 17:17.204
it's too painful to even
look at toothpaste.

17:26.882 --> 17:30.652
Okay, according to the schedule,
registration is in a half hour.

17:30.654 --> 17:33.162
After Austin signs his paperwork,
there's nothing we can do.

17:33.180 --> 17:35.123
We gotta get in there
before it's too late.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.012
Oh no.

17:36.043 --> 17:39.561
This says Austin's at the school barber
right now getting his head shaved.

17:39.563 --> 17:40.929
His hair is all he has left!

17:40.931 --> 17:42.530
Really, Dez?

17:42.532 --> 17:44.599
Austin's about to enroll
in military school,

17:44.601 --> 17:46.735
and you're worried about
something as silly as his hair?

17:46.737 --> 17:48.536
Those golden locks?

17:48.538 --> 17:50.538
The way it flows in
the summer breeze.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.841
How it perfectly
cascades behind his...

17:52.843 --> 17:54.644
We've gotta get in there
before it's too late!

17:56.245 --> 17:58.980
Dez, we'll distract the
guard so you can sneak in.

17:58.982 --> 18:00.582
Okay, thank you.

18:28.577 --> 18:29.744
Can I help you?

18:29.746 --> 18:30.912
Yes.

18:30.914 --> 18:32.313
Hello.

18:32.315 --> 18:34.048
Yes.

18:34.050 --> 18:36.151
You can help us.

18:36.153 --> 18:38.353
- Right, Trish?
- Yes.

18:38.355 --> 18:40.321
Oh, yeah.

18:40.323 --> 18:42.023
Uh, we're looking for our...

18:42.025 --> 18:43.358
- Grandma.
- Bird.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.659
Our bird's grandma.

18:44.661 --> 18:47.662
Or our grandma's bird.

18:47.664 --> 18:49.664
Which would make
much more sense.

18:54.236 --> 18:56.337
Oh, look. It's a
bird over there.

19:05.748 --> 19:08.149
And that's when she
flew out of the window.

19:08.151 --> 19:09.951
The bird, not our grandma.

19:09.953 --> 19:11.186
Grandma's don't fly.

19:15.324 --> 19:17.826
- Doof.
- Excuse me?

19:17.828 --> 19:20.795
Uh, Doof is our grandma's name.

19:20.797 --> 19:22.897
Yep, old Nana Doof.

19:22.899 --> 19:24.365
It sounds like a
real name, right?

19:39.715 --> 19:43.284
That five-minute song and dance
routine was sweet and all,

19:43.286 --> 19:45.687
but what does it have to do
with your grandma's bird?

19:45.689 --> 19:47.722
Uh...

19:51.193 --> 19:53.127
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.

19:53.129 --> 19:54.762
- Ow!
- I didn't hear that either.

19:54.764 --> 19:56.231
Mm-mm.

19:56.233 --> 19:58.166
Guys, I got us in.
Come on, let's go.

19:58.168 --> 20:00.368
You, come here.

20:01.737 --> 20:03.438
What is going on here?

20:04.406 --> 20:07.242
Uh... I'm their grandma's bird.

20:09.446 --> 20:11.045
Ca... caw?

20:15.084 --> 20:18.152
We weren't really looking
for old Nana Doof's bird.

20:18.154 --> 20:19.721
It's true.

20:19.723 --> 20:21.356
I'm not a bird.

20:23.325 --> 20:26.728
We were just trying to sneak in
to see our friend Austin moon.

20:26.730 --> 20:28.296
Well, why didn't you say so?

20:28.298 --> 20:29.330
Go on in.

20:29.332 --> 20:30.221
- Really?
- Seriously?

20:30.252 --> 20:32.400
Sure, students have
visitors all the time.

20:32.402 --> 20:36.304
You just have to sign in, and I
will give you an I.D. Badge.

20:36.306 --> 20:37.906
Sweet.

20:37.908 --> 20:39.007
And a breath mint.

20:56.358 --> 20:58.993
Not the hair!

21:06.169 --> 21:08.736
No-oo!

21:17.379 --> 21:19.447
Austin, I can't fix it!

21:19.449 --> 21:20.381
- Huh?
- What?

21:20.383 --> 21:21.916
Austin?

21:21.918 --> 21:23.318
What did they do to your face?

21:23.320 --> 21:24.320
Guys?

21:25.754 --> 21:27.322
- Austin!
- It's you!

21:27.324 --> 21:29.424
What are you doing here?

21:29.426 --> 21:31.793
You can't go to military school.

21:31.795 --> 21:33.094
We came here to stop you.

21:33.096 --> 21:34.429
What? Why?

21:34.431 --> 21:38.433
We all decided to stay in Miami, so we
can enjoy our senior year together.

21:38.435 --> 21:39.901
Are you serious?

21:39.903 --> 21:41.369
- Yes!
- All right!

21:41.371 --> 21:43.972
The fearsome foursome is back!

21:43.974 --> 21:45.273
- Yeah, not so much.
- It's getting really old.

21:45.275 --> 21:46.507
We're not doing that.

22:02.125 --> 22:03.524
Man, I love that song.

22:03.526 --> 22:06.060
I'm really glad everyone
decided to stay.

22:06.062 --> 22:07.862
This year's gonna
be the best, man.

22:07.864 --> 22:09.564
You said it. I
couldn't be happier.

22:09.566 --> 22:11.165
Nothing could bring me down.

22:12.101 --> 22:13.541
Hey, is there something
in my teeth?

22:14.370 --> 22:16.504
Carrie!

22:20.042 --> 22:20.689
What's going on?

22:20.720 --> 22:23.277
- We're brushing your teeth.
- Whether you like it or not.

22:25.148 --> 22:26.280
Is that Aqua Smile?

22:26.282 --> 22:29.350
No-oo!
