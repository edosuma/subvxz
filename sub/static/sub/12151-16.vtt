00:01.929 --> 00:04.389
- Previously;
- Check me out. I'm Mr. Dad.

00:04.929 --> 00:06.679
I need the blood of Angel's son.

00:07.330 --> 00:09.080
- Got it? How?
- Swiped it.

00:09.730 --> 00:12.640
Things have been slow since
Cordelia and the Groosalugg left.

00:12.730 --> 00:16.350
You've been holed up with all those
prophecies and books. You okay?

00:17.530 --> 00:20.579
That the vampire will devour
his child is certain.

00:21.129 --> 00:23.160
- When will it happen?
- It's already started.

00:23.530 --> 00:25.489
The evil beside you.

00:25.929 --> 00:27.960
Earthquake, fire, blood.

00:34.929 --> 00:37.100
- It's okay.
- Earthquake, fire, blood.

01:10.930 --> 01:12.090
Jeez, Wes.

01:13.329 --> 01:15.750
Don't you know what you're
supposed to do?

01:19.329 --> 01:22.099
You pick them up when they fuss.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.750
Daddy's here.

01:25.329 --> 01:28.420
Sorry, I don't know what I was--
I didn't sleep well.

01:28.930 --> 01:30.510
You look like hell.

01:31.329 --> 01:34.069
And not the fun one,
where they burn you for all eternity...

01:34.329 --> 01:37.170
...but the hard-core one.
You know, Nixon and Britney Spears.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.879
- You're awfully chipper today.
- Yeah, it's weird.

01:41.530 --> 01:45.599
Maybe it was the earthquake, but I
barely slept, and I have all this energy.

01:46.329 --> 01:47.590
I could drink a horse.

01:48.129 --> 01:50.129
Speaking of earthquake...

01:50.530 --> 01:53.719
- ...you realize we have no insurance.
- Yeah, bummer.

01:54.129 --> 01:56.760
- And your room is--
- The wreck of the Hesperus.

01:57.730 --> 02:02.150
Don't worry. The best part about owning
a hotel is there's plenty of rooms.

02:02.530 --> 02:04.109
I'll move to another one
till it's fixed.

02:06.730 --> 02:08.658
Who is that singing?

02:09.128 --> 02:12.889
- Lorne's seeing a client in the garden.
- She's good.

02:14.530 --> 02:17.060
Do you want to see the lady sing?

02:18.729 --> 02:22.169
I fell so far

02:22.930 --> 02:26.650
A light went on in my heart

02:28.330 --> 02:30.289
You're gone

02:30.729 --> 02:36.030
Now I'm left alone in the dark

02:37.330 --> 02:38.729
Do you see anything?

02:39.729 --> 02:43.419
I see you're plenty scared.
It's all right, keep going.

02:45.729 --> 02:48.219
My soul is aching

02:48.729 --> 02:50.659
Hey, now, no fussing.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.689
Do you wanna see something cool?
Sure you do.

02:55.930 --> 02:57.819
Look.

02:58.330 --> 03:01.740
You like that broadsword?

03:02.530 --> 03:04.599
That's your old man's favorite.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.180
Wes, he's gonna be crawling
in no time.

03:07.930 --> 03:10.180
We gotta start baby-proofing
this place.

03:10.330 --> 03:15.949
Take him. Yeah, it's all right, it's
your Uncle Wes. He loves you bunches.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.259
He's just English.

03:18.729 --> 03:21.400
Are you crazy? It's the best state.

03:21.729 --> 03:23.759
What's wrong with Texas?

03:25.930 --> 03:27.930
Texas doesn't hate the black man.

03:28.330 --> 03:32.580
Texas loves the black man. Well,
most of Texas. Anyone with a brain.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.900
- What's so great about California?
- Everything.

03:36.729 --> 03:38.060
It's got the climate...

03:38.530 --> 03:40.919
- ...the ocean.
- The earth that swallows you whole.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.000
- The Lakers, the music.
- The traffic...

03:43.930 --> 03:45.469
- ...the smog.
- It's got you.

03:46.330 --> 03:48.580
- Okay, you win. Morning.
- Hi.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.280
Glad to see you're using the
company phones for important calls.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.469
- Want me to pay?
- Chain them up.

03:54.729 --> 03:57.259
- What?
- Let's chain and lock the weapons.

03:57.729 --> 04:01.729
Better safe than sorry. Isn't that
right? He likes you, I can tell.

04:02.530 --> 04:04.069
I like him too.

04:04.330 --> 04:09.180
I was thinking perhaps I'd take him to
the park or beach. Just the two of us.

04:10.330 --> 04:12.219
Maybe in the next day or two.

04:12.729 --> 04:14.520
Sounds great. Count on it.

04:15.129 --> 04:18.680
Guys, there's something you should--
Can you come here for a sec?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.959
Everybody, this is my friend Kim.

04:25.930 --> 04:29.370
It's all right, they're professionals.
Take it from the chorus.

04:32.529 --> 04:36.110
My heart is breaking

04:36.730 --> 04:39.259
In two

04:40.329 --> 04:45.209
No love
No light left, no you

04:46.329 --> 04:49.420
I'll hack your eyeballs out
and rip your children in two!

04:54.730 --> 04:57.540
It's all right. It's okay.

04:57.730 --> 05:00.680
It's all right. It's okay.
Catchy finish, huh?

05:52.649 --> 05:55.139
Kim came to see me
a couple of years ago.

05:55.649 --> 05:56.980
You put me on my true path.

05:57.449 --> 06:00.540
She was wasting in medical school
when she should've been a singer.

06:01.050 --> 06:03.300
Who needs more doctors
when you can have singing demons?

06:03.449 --> 06:05.620
The demon part is new.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.470
Singing demons, flying nuns.
Good one, G.

06:10.649 --> 06:13.350
She hooked up with this band
recently and--

06:14.250 --> 06:17.829
They were mellow. Organic types. Never
did drugs or played a diminished chord.

06:18.449 --> 06:23.579
I like nuns. How did the Flying Nun
fly, anyway? Was it God or magic?

06:28.050 --> 06:32.620
What? You think about these things
sometimes. Please, continue.

06:34.050 --> 06:39.779
They started changing. Stevie, the
lead guitar, grew a seventh finger.

06:41.250 --> 06:44.660
- Seventh?
- He already had six. I just thought--

06:45.449 --> 06:47.129
I don't know what I thought.

06:47.850 --> 06:51.290
Raw, the drummer, sprouted
this spiny thing on his back...

06:52.050 --> 06:56.120
...and they started playing this
beyond industrial, trash-noise funk.

06:56.850 --> 07:00.360
Day and night. And then it
happened to me. You saw it.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.350
- Am I gonna turn into that?
- No.

07:05.250 --> 07:09.250
You're human, they're not.
It isn't permanent. It's an infection.

07:10.050 --> 07:14.790
It's cured by taking 2O milligrams of
cylenthiam twice a day for a month.

07:15.449 --> 07:17.660
A mystical antibiotic.
I'll get you some.

07:18.449 --> 07:22.519
I thought your saliva was suspect,
being green and all. No offense, Lorne.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.779
Under the microscope,
it showed traces of penloxia.

07:26.250 --> 07:29.160
- They're Wraith-ers.
- Wraith-ers?

07:29.850 --> 07:32.620
Demons that can make themselves
look human for a time.

07:33.449 --> 07:35.730
Then they revert to what
they really are.

07:36.449 --> 07:38.980
- Why look like musicians?
- For the chicks.

07:39.449 --> 07:44.579
Musicians get the chicks. They're gonna
appear as dentists? Let's take them out.

07:45.449 --> 07:47.339
- Where are they?
- In the rehearsal space.

07:47.850 --> 07:50.379
It's an old loading dock behind
the Shop 'n' Go in Echo Park.

07:50.850 --> 07:51.970
Wes?

07:52.050 --> 07:56.829
You have to kill Wraith-ers. You, Gunn
and Fred go. Lorne, stay with the baby.

07:58.050 --> 07:59.589
I have some business to do.

07:59.850 --> 08:02.800
Shouldn't we call Cordelia and
the Groosalugg back into action?

08:03.449 --> 08:07.980
If one of us gets hurt, say, killing
Wraith-ers, we'll need some backup.

08:08.850 --> 08:12.500
I don't want to disturb her.
It's just a couple of Wraith-ers.

08:13.050 --> 08:14.379
Three, actually.

08:14.850 --> 08:18.180
Piece of cake. I'm up for a little
kick-ass. Who's with me?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.439
Good.

08:23.250 --> 08:27.709
He'd be sucking the life out of you right
now. Never take your eyes off a vampire.

08:28.649 --> 08:33.500
Feel where your fellow soldiers are.
Trust each other with your lives.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.279
Never, ever trust a bloodsucker.

08:45.450 --> 08:46.779
Keep practicing.

08:51.450 --> 08:52.779
Get him up.

09:00.450 --> 09:03.429
- I don't like it.
- They'll learn, or they'll die.

09:04.049 --> 09:08.720
Not that. They're coming right along.
I don't like tea in these cotton cups.

09:09.450 --> 09:12.080
It's called Styrofoam.
I'll get you some china ones.

09:13.649 --> 09:16.600
Thank you, Justine. Are you ready?

09:18.450 --> 09:19.679
Yes.

09:20.250 --> 09:24.039
- What are you not sure of? Is it me?
- No.

09:26.850 --> 09:30.820
It's these people that work for Angel.
We may end up killing a lot of them.

09:31.649 --> 09:32.980
We might kill them all.

09:32.850 --> 09:36.779
I'd follow you to the gates of hell
to kill vampires, Daniel.

09:37.649 --> 09:38.840
But people...

09:40.649 --> 09:44.299
...even evil people who help vampires,
are another kettle of fish?

09:47.850 --> 09:51.220
They chose Angel.
That makes them enemy soldiers.

09:51.450 --> 09:53.980
So I guess that makes it all right.

09:54.450 --> 09:55.850
Mr. Wyndam-Price.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.159
- Nice to see you again.
- What the hell do you want?

09:59.850 --> 10:02.940
Don't be rude, Justine.
He's our guest.

10:04.049 --> 10:08.090
And in the throes of a very
difficult decision, I imagine.

10:10.649 --> 10:12.019
You want some apple?

10:17.250 --> 10:19.529
I hate your zit-face smile
That's why I cut it in two

10:20.250 --> 10:21.259
Scoop out your blood
Your brain, your bowls

10:21.450 --> 10:24.120
And when I'm done with you
I throg your mother, brother

10:24.450 --> 10:26.549
Uncle, sister
And your little dog too

10:33.450 --> 10:35.769
Dude, you're paying for that window.

10:36.450 --> 10:38.730
- No, I'm not.
- Are you the A and R guys?

10:38.850 --> 10:43.519
This isn't even the whole band.
We got a killer chick who sings.

10:44.850 --> 10:46.080
Hey, baby.

10:46.649 --> 10:48.860
Don't worry about the window, homes.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.190
We're not the A and R guys.
We're just here to kill you.

10:52.049 --> 10:54.049
Dude, they want to kill us.

10:54.450 --> 10:57.190
Okay. But they're still
paying for the window.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.240
I got first ride on the hottie.

11:02.250 --> 11:04.389
- Get them out of here.
- Be careful.

11:11.850 --> 11:13.779
Come on, take it like a demon.

11:46.649 --> 11:48.019
That was fun.

11:48.769 --> 11:52.320
I don't want to see anyone get hurt.
Your soldiers or mine.

11:53.570 --> 11:59.259
I share your hatred of violence. I've
meted out less of it than Angelus has.

12:00.169 --> 12:02.590
- Angel.
- Whatever you wish to call him.

12:03.169 --> 12:06.820
I will never agree that he's absolved
from his past by the presence of a soul.

12:07.370 --> 12:10.000
He's a vampire. End of discussion.

12:10.370 --> 12:14.899
And I bet you a dollar this one's here
to stab us in the back.

12:18.169 --> 12:19.539
Who did you lose?

12:19.970 --> 12:21.129
What?

12:21.769 --> 12:26.230
You're here in Holtz's army, ready to
kill others, die for the cause....

12:27.769 --> 12:30.259
You must have lost someone
very important to you.

12:30.769 --> 12:32.240
That's not your business.

12:32.570 --> 12:35.620
Her twin sister, Julia,
was murdered by vampires.

12:36.169 --> 12:39.289
You lost family. I'm sorry.

12:43.370 --> 12:47.690
Angel and the people
I work with are my family.

12:48.169 --> 12:50.519
When I say I don't want to see
anyone get hurt...

12:52.370 --> 12:54.299
...I mostly mean them.

12:57.769 --> 13:00.019
But I don't stab people in the back.

13:01.370 --> 13:03.259
You're an honest man.

13:05.570 --> 13:06.830
I trust you.

13:08.570 --> 13:11.309
- And you can trust me.
- It's funny, I don't.

13:12.169 --> 13:16.980
Your problem isn't me. Your problem is
your friend who's gonna kill his child.

13:18.769 --> 13:24.250
You know you have to do something
about it. You know if you don't, I will.

13:25.970 --> 13:30.919
Don't misunderstand me. I won't stand
by while an innocent child is murdered.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.990
But I won't endanger other
innocent lives unless I'm forced to.

13:35.570 --> 13:36.799
How long do I have?

13:38.570 --> 13:40.289
I'll give you one day.

13:40.970 --> 13:45.009
You may not trust me,
but I trust you to do what's right.

13:46.370 --> 13:48.929
One day. After that...

13:51.169 --> 13:52.919
...everyone will get hurt.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.840
So Sammy's at the Flamingo.

14:00.169 --> 14:03.649
Frank, Dino, Peter, Joey
and Shirley are all front row center.

14:04.370 --> 14:06.299
Sammy starts singing
"I Did It My Way. "

14:06.769 --> 14:10.950
Then he stops and says, "I can't sing
this song in front of you, Frank. "

14:12.169 --> 14:14.340
The crowd loves it. They're laughing.

14:14.570 --> 14:17.169
Then Frank calls out,
"Hey, you're short...

14:17.570 --> 14:20.870
...you're one-eyed, and you're Jewish.
Don't be intimidated."

14:22.970 --> 14:24.049
And the crowd goes wild.

14:24.169 --> 14:27.649
- How'd it go?
- The Wraith-ers are no more.

14:28.370 --> 14:29.840
- Tore them apart.
- Literally.

14:32.570 --> 14:36.259
He has been so good the whole
time his daddy's been gone.

14:36.769 --> 14:41.090
Do you miss your daddy? He's here.
I think Connor needs some papa love.

14:42.169 --> 14:44.909
He needs a lot of things.
All day, every day.

14:45.169 --> 14:46.399
That's how kids--

14:46.970 --> 14:50.899
He needs a bath, he needs a bottle.
What Connor needs is to grow up.

14:52.970 --> 14:55.289
- Something wrong?
- No, everything's great.

14:55.370 --> 14:58.669
I got a kid that cries, pees, moans,
and never gives me a moment to myself.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.870
- It's all right.
- It's really not. Connor, shut up!

15:03.169 --> 15:06.259
- Don't yell at him. He's just a baby.
- He keeps it up, he won't be.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.710
You better get a grip.

15:23.570 --> 15:25.389
What's wrong with me?

15:32.850 --> 15:35.690
- Something's not right.
- You could say that.

15:36.450 --> 15:39.220
When did you start
drinking so much blood?

15:39.450 --> 15:42.750
- I don't know. A few days ago.
- Where'd you get it?

15:43.649 --> 15:46.529
Same butcher as always.
It's pig's blood.

15:47.850 --> 15:50.379
This last batch just
seemed so much more....

15:50.850 --> 15:52.039
What?

15:53.850 --> 15:55.179
Tasty.

15:55.649 --> 15:58.909
You were hyped this morning, then
you went all Tyson on those demons.

15:59.850 --> 16:02.480
Then you crashed, had another drink,
then you started throwing things.

16:02.850 --> 16:06.149
Like my Aunt Viola and her
Southern Comfort.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.909
Hey, vampire.

16:09.450 --> 16:12.779
Need to drink something red.
Doesn't make me a blood-aholic.

16:13.649 --> 16:15.789
Unless someone's spiking your drink.

16:17.850 --> 16:19.039
Let's find out.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.610
Daddy!

16:37.009 --> 16:40.309
Hey, there, kiddo. How's my boy, huh?

16:41.210 --> 16:43.879
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

16:57.409 --> 17:01.759
For God's sake. I know you're
better at following people than this.

17:10.009 --> 17:11.660
So, what's the play?

17:14.809 --> 17:17.160
I just need to talk to you.

17:17.809 --> 17:20.720
I'm alone. He doesn't know that I'm....

17:21.410 --> 17:24.220
- I want to talk to you about him.
- Holtz?

17:25.608 --> 17:27.858
Great guy. Not overly tall.

17:28.009 --> 17:30.990
Is this the part where you offer
to help me behind his back?

17:31.609 --> 17:35.089
Do you believe in anything?
Or is it all just a big scam to you?

17:35.809 --> 17:37.880
You're a soldier. I respect that.

17:38.809 --> 17:42.740
You think your boss is noble and good.
I respect that. Trouble is, he's not.

17:43.009 --> 17:45.710
- You work with a vampire.
- Who, in fact, is noble and good.

17:46.609 --> 17:52.119
Quirky, but there it is. Holtz talks
about justice, but he wants revenge.

17:53.210 --> 17:57.990
He's driven by it, blinded by it. He'll
kill anybody who gets in his way.

17:59.210 --> 18:03.490
You're wrong. You don't know him.
All that he's done for me, for us all....

18:04.009 --> 18:05.759
It sounds like a nice cult.

18:08.210 --> 18:12.279
He gave you his word. He'll keep it.
You're the one who's blind.

18:14.809 --> 18:16.039
How so?

18:16.609 --> 18:21.349
What you're about to do to your friend.
It's easier to hate Holtz than yourself.

18:23.210 --> 18:26.619
There's enough to go around
for both him and me.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.640
Be careful.

18:36.410 --> 18:39.529
You are being careful.
I didn't even hear you leave.

18:50.369 --> 18:52.509
Want to hold him? He's sleeping.

18:55.170 --> 18:58.009
Maybe it's not such a good idea
right now.

19:00.569 --> 19:04.190
So there's more to pig's blood
than meets the eye.

19:06.569 --> 19:11.140
- There's just a trace of--
- Human blood in it. I feel it.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.039
It's his.

19:16.769 --> 19:17.930
It's Connor's.

19:18.569 --> 19:20.079
How do you know that?

19:21.569 --> 19:26.349
The past couple of days,
he's smelled like food.

19:28.170 --> 19:33.119
They've been feeding you your son's
blood so you'll like it and want more.

19:35.970 --> 19:37.549
Who's "they"?

19:38.970 --> 19:40.579
Who do you think?

20:04.769 --> 20:08.349
Like a cat. Can't hear you...

20:08.970 --> 20:12.450
...but I'm starting to be able
to feel you when you're near.

20:14.970 --> 20:17.250
Isn't that nice and creepy?

20:17.970 --> 20:20.670
- How'd you find me?
- Your assistant.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.710
- I'll have his arms broken.
- Already taken care of.

20:24.569 --> 20:25.730
And am I next?

20:26.369 --> 20:29.700
Lilah, there are so many things
I could do to you.

20:31.769 --> 20:36.650
With transfusions, I could keep you
alive indefinitely. I am experienced.

20:40.170 --> 20:43.289
My own son. How could you?

20:45.569 --> 20:47.079
It's my job.

20:53.369 --> 20:58.430
Don't you get tired of the femme fatale
act? Whiskey, straight. Lots of it.

20:58.769 --> 21:03.019
How about just once you
talk to me like a person?

21:04.170 --> 21:06.490
I've been doing this a long damn time.

21:07.170 --> 21:10.539
I've had to be better, smarter, quicker
than every man at Wolfram & Hart.

21:11.369 --> 21:13.789
So it's a feminist thing. It's on her.

21:14.369 --> 21:19.319
It's a survival thing. I made a lot of
devil's bargains, and I stuck to them.

21:20.369 --> 21:23.460
As a result, I live somewhat
dangerously and quite comfortably.

21:23.970 --> 21:28.109
My mother, who doesn't recognize me,
has the best room at the clinic.

21:29.369 --> 21:31.759
I put on my game face
and do what I have to.

21:32.369 --> 21:37.809
You wear a game face long enough,
it stops being removable.

21:39.569 --> 21:40.829
Wow.

21:41.369 --> 21:44.140
We have spent so much time
and money on you...

21:44.970 --> 21:49.109
...you're so pivotal to the coming
cataclysms, I forget how dense you are.

21:49.769 --> 21:54.049
The game face, the one I worked so
hard to get, I became that years ago.

21:54.569 --> 21:56.640
Just like you've become simpering
and good from yours.

21:57.569 --> 21:59.569
You're the poster boy for human.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.720
Thank you, I don't want it.

22:01.769 --> 22:05.349
Speaking as one non-human to another,
I'm sorry if I hit a nerve.

22:06.569 --> 22:11.279
You think you can awaken some buried
spark of decency in me?

22:11.970 --> 22:14.109
Is that the way you
"help your helpless"?

22:15.569 --> 22:17.359
I am not helpless.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.390
I'm glad you came.
I was feeling a little...

22:20.970 --> 22:22.970
... "what's it all about?"
And now I know.

22:23.369 --> 22:26.279
It is all about making the rest
of your eternal life miserable.

22:28.170 --> 22:29.990
Shall we drink to that?

22:30.569 --> 22:33.690
You backstabbing, traitorous bitch.

22:35.369 --> 22:39.410
I have a lot of work to do. I can't
be in every time-space at once.

22:40.170 --> 22:42.910
And I find you drinking
with my sworn enemy.

22:43.170 --> 22:47.769
Sworn enemy? Really? Have we met?
Because I don't remember swearing.

22:48.569 --> 22:50.109
Sahjhan, he found me.

22:53.369 --> 22:56.920
So you all are in cahoots.

22:58.170 --> 23:02.700
Ethereal time-traveling demon.... You're
the screwball that brought Holtz back.

23:04.769 --> 23:07.230
How's that working out?
He's not fond of demons.

23:07.769 --> 23:09.450
You'll learn nothing from me.

23:09.569 --> 23:12.029
Other than, you're his sworn enemy
who brought Holtz back...

23:12.569 --> 23:15.130
...and when that failed,
you came to me. Idiot.

23:16.170 --> 23:20.029
You think my life is easy? I'm
jumping from dimension to dimension.

23:20.369 --> 23:25.359
I don't always hear. Sometimes it's just
a visual. I saw you two all chummy.

23:26.369 --> 23:28.539
So why do you want to kill me?

23:28.769 --> 23:33.089
He wouldn't tell me either. Not that I
need a reason. I was just curious.

23:34.170 --> 23:37.220
Did he boink your demon bride?
Eat your mother?

23:40.170 --> 23:42.339
You really don't know who he is.

23:43.170 --> 23:44.430
You will pay.

23:45.569 --> 23:47.009
For what?

23:49.769 --> 23:53.880
Well, whatever his grudge,
I think you just made him madder.

24:22.970 --> 24:24.369
What are you doing?

24:25.970 --> 24:28.500
Hi. I'm taking Connor.

24:28.970 --> 24:30.089
Where?

24:30.769 --> 24:33.720
To my place. We're going
to the park in the morning.

24:34.369 --> 24:36.329
Angel knows all about it.

24:38.569 --> 24:40.890
- Are Fred and Gunn--?
- Out. Getting food.

24:40.970 --> 24:42.900
That girl can put away the chow.

24:43.369 --> 24:44.950
Here, I heated up a bottle.

24:46.970 --> 24:49.460
Hey, Angel didn't say
anything about....

24:49.970 --> 24:52.710
He probably forgot.
He went off in a hurry.

24:52.970 --> 24:56.019
- What happened?
- He was acting weird this morning.

24:57.170 --> 24:58.500
I'm sure you noticed.

24:58.369 --> 25:01.069
When he came back
from killing the Wraith-ers....

25:01.970 --> 25:03.829
It's okay. It's your Uncle Wes.

25:04.369 --> 25:09.039
You like your Uncle Wes.
We're gonna have a great time.

25:46.369 --> 25:50.720
All right. That's a boy. That's a boy.

25:52.970 --> 25:54.130
Angel.

25:54.769 --> 25:55.960
Where is everybody?

25:56.569 --> 26:01.700
Fred and Gunn went for food. Lorne
had to go out. I'm watching the baby.

26:02.569 --> 26:04.779
I packed up some overnight things.

26:05.569 --> 26:09.289
We talked about me taking Connor to
the park, and the one near my place....

26:09.769 --> 26:13.210
It's full of kids. I thought he could
spend the night with me.

26:17.569 --> 26:19.599
That's probably a really good idea.

26:22.970 --> 26:26.869
- You want to say goodbye?
- Okay. Hey. Hey.

26:27.170 --> 26:32.230
Sleep tight, big guy, huh?
Daddy'll see you real soon.

26:33.170 --> 26:38.579
Check on him a lot. You have his
pediatrician's number? His formula?

26:39.769 --> 26:40.930
I've got all that.

26:42.170 --> 26:45.329
You ever hear of a time-traveling
demon named Sahjhan?

26:45.769 --> 26:46.930
No.

26:48.170 --> 26:51.190
The guy that brought Holtz here.
He thinks I'm his sworn enemy.

26:51.769 --> 26:55.140
I don't know him.
Can you hit the books before you go?

26:56.569 --> 27:01.069
Where's Lorne? He doesn't show his
face pronto, Fred'll eat his hoagie.

27:01.970 --> 27:04.180
I will not. I already had two.

27:05.569 --> 27:07.599
Unless he's really not here.

27:07.970 --> 27:09.829
- He had to go out.
- Where?

27:10.369 --> 27:11.839
Where'd you say he went?

27:12.170 --> 27:15.789
I don't know. He didn't say.
I think he had to see a client.

27:16.369 --> 27:19.140
I've got better reference materials
for your demon at home.

27:19.970 --> 27:23.089
And Connor's getting sleepy.
Why don't I look into it there?

27:28.369 --> 27:32.440
Okay.
Just call me if you find something.

27:36.170 --> 27:37.569
I guess....

27:40.369 --> 27:41.980
I'll see everyone tomorrow.

27:42.170 --> 27:46.069
Hey, Wes, what's the closest
emergency room to your place?

27:47.569 --> 27:51.470
Drew Medical, one minute away.
Top infant-care center. Don't worry.

27:58.369 --> 28:01.210
Well, my first whole night
without the kid.

28:04.369 --> 28:06.369
This'll be good for both of us.

28:06.769 --> 28:08.940
He can bond with his Uncle Wes...

28:13.369 --> 28:15.089
...and I can get some rest.

28:16.970 --> 28:18.759
- We'll stay up with you.
- Really?

28:18.769 --> 28:20.069
Thanks.

28:20.569 --> 28:21.970
He's just a little guy.

28:22.970 --> 28:23.809
I'm sure he'll be--

28:25.970 --> 28:27.650
Is someone in Wes' office?

28:48.650 --> 28:50.400
Won't you come in.

28:51.049 --> 28:53.079
How's fatherhood treating you?

28:54.049 --> 28:55.279
I like it.

28:57.650 --> 29:01.089
You know,
I met a friend of yours tonight.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.579
A demon named Sahjhan.

29:03.650 --> 29:06.460
- What did he have to say?
- He was cryptic.

29:06.650 --> 29:09.769
Actually, he was long-winded.
I didn't get what his deal was.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.730
He hates me. Do you know why?

29:14.450 --> 29:16.309
I don't really care why.

29:17.450 --> 29:19.839
Where is the little nipper?

29:20.450 --> 29:24.490
He had to go out. Sorry.
I know he'd love to meet you.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.180
I'm sure he'll turn up.

29:28.849 --> 29:30.670
You've made a nice life here.

29:31.250 --> 29:34.059
Did you come here to fight,
or should I make some tea?

29:37.250 --> 29:39.500
I want to keep Angelus alive.

29:40.849 --> 29:43.450
- But not well.
- Come on!

30:47.450 --> 30:51.029
- Come on. Are you hurt?
- I don't think so. The baby....

30:51.650 --> 30:53.299
Call Wes.

30:55.250 --> 30:58.339
Jeez, Lorne, they got you good.
You better sit down.

31:00.049 --> 31:01.210
What?

31:01.849 --> 31:05.259
They didn't do this to me. Wesley did.

31:07.250 --> 31:08.410
Wesley?

31:08.450 --> 31:10.450
What are you talking about?

31:11.450 --> 31:13.799
Earlier, when he came for the baby...

31:14.450 --> 31:18.630
...Connor started crying, and Wes
hummed a lullaby, and I read him--

31:20.450 --> 31:22.700
- I don't know why he did it.
- Did what?

31:24.049 --> 31:28.049
He's been to see Holtz
behind your back, twice.

31:28.849 --> 31:32.400
He's not taking the baby overnight.
He's taking the baby away.

31:33.650 --> 31:34.839
For good.

32:04.930 --> 32:06.369
That's close enough.

32:16.329 --> 32:17.519
Justine?

32:17.529 --> 32:19.250
He's everything you said.

32:21.130 --> 32:22.319
It's true.

32:27.130 --> 32:28.319
What happened?

32:29.529 --> 32:32.900
Well, he didn't keep his word.

32:39.130 --> 32:40.670
He took everybody...

32:42.130 --> 32:44.200
...and he went after the baby.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.990
And when I questioned him....

32:48.730 --> 32:52.279
Bastard. I'll kill him for this.

32:54.130 --> 32:55.809
You have to get out of here.

32:57.730 --> 33:00.920
- You have to get to a hospital.
- No. I just need to do this.

33:26.049 --> 33:29.490
It doesn't make sense. Why
would Wes do that? You misread him.

33:30.250 --> 33:33.130
I read him right.
The gash on my head proves it.

33:33.849 --> 33:36.480
He isn't answering his cell,
pager or home.

33:37.450 --> 33:38.609
Where is he?

33:38.650 --> 33:41.809
- Should we get them to a hospital?
- No.

33:42.849 --> 33:47.130
Holtz knew Connor wasn't here.
He would've torn the place apart.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.819
- He was stalling.
- Buying Wesley time to get away.

33:50.650 --> 33:51.980
Holtz is the key. I want Holtz.

33:52.450 --> 33:53.710
If I find Wesley with him--

33:53.650 --> 33:56.420
We don't know the whole story.
I don't think getting too pumped--

33:57.250 --> 33:59.319
- I don't care what you think.
- Easy.

33:59.650 --> 34:01.579
- He took my son.
- I know. I'm just saying--

34:02.049 --> 34:04.259
- He took my son!
- Get your hands off me!

34:05.049 --> 34:06.450
Stop it, both of you!

34:06.849 --> 34:09.170
This isn't helping, damn it! Back off!

34:10.449 --> 34:13.960
Only one thing that matters now,
and that's, where is Connor?

34:20.650 --> 34:23.349
- Where's Holtz?
- You think I'd tell--

34:29.050 --> 34:32.099
I'm gonna count to three,
then I'm gonna bury this in your face.

34:32.650 --> 34:36.159
2239 Santa Elena.
It's a big Victorian in Silver Lake.

34:38.650 --> 34:42.579
- We better find Wes before he does.
- We should start at his place.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.800
I'll stay here in case he comes back.

34:49.449 --> 34:51.239
And this time I'll be ready.

35:04.289 --> 35:05.409
What do we know?

35:06.090 --> 35:09.880
No Holtz, no baby.
These don't know where Holtz went.

35:10.289 --> 35:12.179
Get them off the street.

35:13.289 --> 35:15.289
- So we're in the right place?
- Yeah.

35:15.690 --> 35:16.849
Excuse me?

35:18.090 --> 35:21.280
Yes, ma'am. But Holtz didn't come
back here after the hotel.

35:21.690 --> 35:24.460
- Where'd he go?
- We had him, and we lost him.

35:25.889 --> 35:27.570
We're picking him up again.

35:28.889 --> 35:31.800
Just give me a moment, please.
Spring Street.

35:32.489 --> 35:34.559
- Downtown.
- Near the Sixth Street Bridge.

35:34.889 --> 35:36.679
- Let's go.
- Sixth Street Bridge.

35:40.289 --> 35:42.460
Let's go. Hustle, hustle, hustle.

36:11.090 --> 36:12.530
It went well?

36:12.889 --> 36:15.519
Very well.
You're paying for my dental work.

36:21.889 --> 36:27.369
Hello, son. I'm your father. That lady
with the black eye is your mother.

36:27.889 --> 36:31.190
Your name is
Steven Franklin Thomas...

36:32.090 --> 36:35.849
...and you'll grow up with me on
a ranch in the middle of nowhere.

36:41.690 --> 36:43.159
What's it like in Utah?

36:44.690 --> 36:46.019
It's pretty.

36:46.489 --> 36:47.679
Let's go.

37:11.090 --> 37:13.230
Come any closer, I'll snap his neck!

37:18.289 --> 37:20.460
- Who are they?
- They work for me.

37:21.289 --> 37:22.730
Oh, the attorney.

37:23.090 --> 37:25.900
Yes. You are gonna give us the kid,
Captain Holtz.

37:26.690 --> 37:28.130
- Don't.
- That's cute.

37:28.489 --> 37:30.559
You'd rather see the fanatic
with the baby than us?

37:30.889 --> 37:34.219
Those are automatic weapons.
They didn't have them in your time.

37:35.090 --> 37:37.119
They fire 16 bullets per second.

37:37.489 --> 37:39.349
And if they were gonna
use them, they would've already.

37:39.889 --> 37:41.429
They want the baby alive.

37:42.289 --> 37:44.150
Something we all have in common.

37:47.690 --> 37:49.130
Not all of us.

37:50.090 --> 37:55.039
You do not want the child alive. You
want him dead. That's our arrangement.

37:55.489 --> 37:57.630
Yeah. I'm a lawyer. Have you met me?

37:58.489 --> 38:00.809
We have a new arrangement.
I'm keeping the baby.

38:01.489 --> 38:05.070
- You can't do that.
- Ignore the loudmouth with the bad skin.

38:06.289 --> 38:08.780
He's impotent in this dimension.

38:09.289 --> 38:11.679
- We're leaving.
- No one's going anywhere.

38:14.690 --> 38:15.989
- Don't shoot.
- Yeah.

38:15.889 --> 38:18.940
You really don't want to.
Your bullets won't kill me.

38:19.489 --> 38:22.050
But mine will kill you, and her first.

38:24.889 --> 38:26.429
He'll be dead before I hit the ground.

38:26.690 --> 38:28.159
I know.

38:29.090 --> 38:32.500
So I'm going to leave now, right?

38:33.289 --> 38:37.679
With me, he gets to live.
Anyone tries to take him, he dies.

38:44.090 --> 38:45.280
Take him.

38:45.289 --> 38:48.059
Whoa. No!
What is wrong with you people?

38:49.489 --> 38:53.389
I will take good care of him,
as though he were my own son.

38:54.289 --> 38:58.190
He'll never even know you existed.
But come after me....

38:58.489 --> 39:02.070
You will, though, won't you?
Maybe I should just--

39:03.289 --> 39:05.610
No. Please.

39:09.289 --> 39:10.519
Take him.

39:25.489 --> 39:30.230
You look into the Quor-toth.
The darkest of the dark worlds.

39:31.489 --> 39:37.219
I can widen the portal, and you'll all be
swallowed by a world you can't imagine.

39:38.090 --> 39:40.900
Or you can keep your word
and kill that child.

39:42.289 --> 39:43.900
Now!

39:46.489 --> 39:48.210
Don't say I didn't warn you.

39:52.489 --> 39:54.099
- Kill it.
- No!

39:57.289 --> 39:58.449
Daniel!

40:00.289 --> 40:01.659
Daniel!

40:02.690 --> 40:05.530
No! No!

40:11.690 --> 40:14.079
Wow. I didn't count on that.

40:14.690 --> 40:16.940
Kind of takes care of my problem.

40:28.489 --> 40:30.030
All right, then.

40:31.489 --> 40:33.000
Have a good summer.

40:38.690 --> 40:41.429
Well, I'm looking at
a mountain of paperwork.

40:46.489 --> 40:48.489
Should we do something about...?

40:50.090 --> 40:51.250
Yes, we should.

40:52.489 --> 40:54.210
We should let him suffer.

41:23.090 --> 41:24.250
Connor.
