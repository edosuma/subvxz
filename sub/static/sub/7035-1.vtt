03:37.384 --> 03:40.112
Save me from my enemy.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.539
Well, hi.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.183
Hi.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.893
You okay?

03:47.894 --> 03:51.188
Yeah... Sorry.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.190
Want something to eat?

03:53.191 --> 03:55.589
No.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.513
- You know what?
- Hmm?

04:02.617 --> 04:04.910
We should get out of
Calgary for a few days.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.912
You know, just take off.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.914
Any place special?

04:08.915 --> 04:11.500
Somewhere we can be alone together.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.210
More alone than this?

04:13.211 --> 04:15.654
Yeah.

04:15.672 --> 04:19.382
No work, no telephone calls.

04:19.384 --> 04:22.453
- No bad dreams.
- No bad dreams.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.289
Mmm...

04:33.607 --> 04:36.630
Decker's been calling again.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.886
When?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.947
All last week, every day.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.532
And what does he want?

04:43.533 --> 04:46.135
I don't know, I haven't talked to him.
I haven't called him back.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.559
Well, if he can help...

04:50.040 --> 04:53.042
I'm just... so frustrated.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.877
You spend all that time
working for somebody and...

04:54.878 --> 04:56.570
Look, go see him.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.486
Okay? Tell him it's all
gone except the bad dreams.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.719
The dreams aren't even
that bad anymore.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.163
I'm actually beginning to like them.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.043
That does sound crazy,
now doesn't it?

05:21.655 --> 05:22.571
Boone.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.048
Aaron?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.534
It's Dr. Decker.

05:26.535 --> 05:29.662
Hey... long time, no speak.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.664
Four months.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.063
So you miss me?

05:34.376 --> 05:37.545
- I need to see you.
- Why? I'm healthy.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.989
I'm feeling good.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.174
I'd like to believe that,
I really would.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.176
So believe it, it's true.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.178
I'm still in my office,
I'll wait for you.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.431
Oh, I uh, can't. I'm on my way out.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.158
Tomorrow then.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.208
Okay...

05:55.397 --> 05:57.022
Is something wrong?

05:57.023 --> 05:59.466
Don't let me down again.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.013
I'll be there.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.357
God help us both.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.014
'Cause I like being fat
because it's comfortable

06:30.015 --> 06:32.641
and I like myself fat.
And I like you fat, too!

06:32.642 --> 06:35.665
Keep it down,
you'll wake the munchkins!

06:36.646 --> 06:37.855
Mommy...

06:37.856 --> 06:40.900
Sweety, you're supposed
to be beddy-byes!

06:40.901 --> 06:42.902
I heard something.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.653
What did you hear, honey?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.405
A bad man.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.324
Oh, everything's alright.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.992
You go back to bed, munchkin,

06:49.993 --> 06:51.827
and I'll come and see
you a bit later, OK?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.896
OK.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.649
Boone!

08:27.007 --> 08:29.234
You've got a visitor.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.831
Wow... you look great.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.132
If I wasn't so dirty...

08:46.151 --> 08:48.424
I've gotta get to rehearsal.

08:51.072 --> 08:54.516
I don't need to see my
baby sing, you know.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.849
Get one more car done and we'll see.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.839
I'm not going to be at home, so...

09:08.840 --> 09:15.197
why don't you meet me at the club,
and we'll go to my place from there?

09:15.430 --> 09:17.202
OK?

09:18.516 --> 09:20.538
Yeah.

09:29.402 --> 09:33.597
You know, most of my colleagues would
have walked away from a case like yours.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.867
But I found you intriguing.

09:36.868 --> 09:40.120
All that talk about
monsters, and Midian.

09:40.121 --> 09:43.040
Only I didn't create 'em, I heard
about 'em from other people.

09:43.041 --> 09:46.668
Yeah, but you've incorporated
it into your private mythology.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.067
I guess I did.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.384
I needed a place to escape to.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.887
A place where all your
sins would be forgiven.

09:56.888 --> 09:57.763
Yeah.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.723
Do you remember what sins?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.433
What do you mean?

10:01.434 --> 10:04.394
Well, when you imagined yourself
being taken away to this...

10:04.395 --> 10:09.316
invented city, to Midian,
what sins were you gonna be forgiven?

10:09.317 --> 10:13.570
Are we back in therapy, Doctor?
They were just dreams.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.406
Midian doesn't exist.
Monsters don't exist.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.951
But murder does, Aaron.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.805
Murder is very, very real.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.932
It might start in the mind...

10:25.083 --> 10:27.981
but then it changes
to flesh and blood.

10:29.254 --> 10:34.049
Two days ago, the police
brought me some photographs.

10:34.050 --> 10:37.136
They wanted to know if any
of my patients was capable...

10:37.137 --> 10:40.456
of doing what's in those photographs.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.285
I'm gonna show them to you.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.313
Why?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.774
Because when you talked
about murder on the tapes...

10:50.775 --> 10:53.610
I assumed it was just hallucination.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.134
That's what I assumed.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.577
What you described on
those tapes, Aaron...

11:01.578 --> 11:04.204
was very detailed. Very specific.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.807
Houses, faces.

11:07.792 --> 11:11.253
These houses. These faces.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.590
No, I... I don't remember.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.258
Would you like to hear it?

11:16.259 --> 11:17.610
No.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.306
So you think I did this?

11:22.307 --> 11:25.267
Six families killed in
ten months, Aaron.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.962
Oh, God...

11:30.857 --> 11:33.425
So what am I gonna do?

11:35.320 --> 11:38.924
You're gonna take these.
They'll help you.

11:41.492 --> 11:45.120
You've got 24 hours
to go to the police...

11:45.121 --> 11:46.872
and tell them the truth.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.271
And that's all I can give you.

16:03.254 --> 16:04.980
Boone?

16:26.611 --> 16:28.195
This is Boone.

16:28.196 --> 16:31.865
You know what to do. Adios.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.783
Yeah, hi, it's me.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.386
I'm at my place and I thought
you were gonna be here.

16:37.079 --> 16:40.248
So come over as soon
as you get this, OK?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.851
I love you... Bye.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.918
Take it easy.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.607
Take it easy.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.026
- What have you been taking tonight?
- Lithium.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.028
Lucky you're in one piece, fella.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.280
This is not Lithium, my friend.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.865
What was I taking?

17:13.866 --> 17:17.219
It looks like it could be some
kind of lab quality hallucinogen.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.704
You're on what we used to
call a bad trip, ol' buddy.

17:20.705 --> 17:24.501
Six families killed
in ten months, Aaron.

17:24.502 --> 17:29.107
Six families killed
in ten months, Aaron.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.220
Please take me.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.619
Take me to Midian!

17:44.897 --> 17:48.797
Take me to Midian, I'll do anything!

17:50.861 --> 17:55.056
Have I missed you?
Have I missed you? No.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.492
Please come. Please come.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.745
Please come. Come and take me.
Take me to Midian!

18:00.746 --> 18:05.601
Please take me. Take me!
Take me to Midian!

18:06.627 --> 18:10.606
Please, I beg you. I'll do anything.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.552
Why won't you come?

18:15.553 --> 18:17.554
What'd you say?

18:17.555 --> 18:19.998
I said shut up!

18:21.726 --> 18:23.351
They won't come while you're here.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.104
They won't show themselves
to the likes of you.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.252
What'd you just say?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.941
What'd you just say?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.610
You said "Midian."

18:31.611 --> 18:34.029
Did I? Maybe.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.473
What do you know about it?

18:37.366 --> 18:40.094
It's where the monsters go.

18:40.328 --> 18:43.056
It takes away the pain.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.070
Hey, wait a minute...

18:52.882 --> 18:54.716
What do you know about it?

18:54.717 --> 18:56.301
They forgive you there.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.280
See, they only take
you if you're worthy.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.599
You know what they do to
those that... aren't worthy?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.268
Kkkkk!

19:05.269 --> 19:07.416
So you know where it is?

19:08.230 --> 19:10.298
You and I could go there.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.030
- They sent you.
- What?

19:17.031 --> 19:19.741
They sent you to take me.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.389
Yes.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.939
But I need to know where it is.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.793
It's a test.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.192
Yes. Yes.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.635
North of Athabasca.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.204
East of Peace River.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.909
North of Dwyer.

19:47.061 --> 19:50.855
You'll take me.
I'm worthy, you ask anyone!

19:50.856 --> 19:53.900
I knew you'd come.
I was... I was waiting!

19:53.901 --> 19:55.193
Good.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.987
I know, I know, I know.
I know. I know.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.741
First, I have to show you.
That's how it works.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.160
- Show me what?
- My true face.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.162
That's what these are for.

20:06.163 --> 20:08.164
I'm an actor, see?

20:08.165 --> 20:10.709
There's a face beneath this face.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.545
- No!
- Let me! You have to see me!

20:13.546 --> 20:16.649
First I show you,
then you take me with you!

20:17.383 --> 20:20.760
Juvenile delinquency,
periodically institutionalized...

20:20.761 --> 20:22.762
some violent episodes.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.390
No criminal charges,
and he's been in my care...

20:36.736 --> 20:39.338
- What the hell have you done?
- Nothing!

20:45.161 --> 20:47.183
In there! They need help!

21:04.889 --> 21:06.661
What's he saying?

21:06.807 --> 21:09.350
He's not making a whole lot of sense.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.436
Something about a
place called "Midian."

21:11.437 --> 21:15.291
He's dying. I think he wants to die.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.194
Inspector, I know Boone.
I know how he talks,

21:19.195 --> 21:21.488
I know how he manipulates.

21:21.489 --> 21:24.491
Now, maybe if the right
words are said to this man,

21:24.492 --> 21:27.094
they'll trigger something.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.142
Go ahead.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.104
I'll do what I can...

21:34.585 --> 21:37.187
but I'll have to have privacy.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.579
Move and I'll slit your throat!

24:58.580 --> 25:01.649
- You've got him?
- I've got him.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.736
Holy shit!

25:07.381 --> 25:09.173
Are you from Midian?

25:09.174 --> 25:12.844
- We should take him below, Peloquin.
- He's not Nightbreed.

25:12.845 --> 25:17.370
- He's natural.
- No, I've killed people!

25:17.391 --> 25:19.308
I-I'm like you. That's why I'm here.

25:19.309 --> 25:22.645
Shut the fuck up. You're meat.

25:22.646 --> 25:25.089
If we eat him we break the law!

25:26.025 --> 25:27.025
That's true.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.424
Everything's true.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.263
God's an astronaut.

25:32.489 --> 25:35.183
Oz is over the rainbow.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.933
And Midian is where
the monsters live.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.832
And you came to die.

25:42.833 --> 25:46.085
I didn't come to die.
I came to be with you.

25:46.086 --> 25:49.610
No. Sorry.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.407
I can smell innocence...

25:55.262 --> 25:56.971
From 50 yards.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.266
I've killed people.
I've killed 15 people!

26:00.267 --> 26:02.685
- Who told you that?
- What do you mean?

26:02.686 --> 26:05.084
He lied, asshole!

26:07.066 --> 26:10.260
You're natural.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.637
That means...

26:13.113 --> 26:14.965
you're meat...

26:15.574 --> 26:17.784
for the beast.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.799
We mustn't! It's the law!

26:32.800 --> 26:35.198
Fuck the law.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.574
I want meat.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.170
Let him go!

27:12.005 --> 27:13.714
Peloquin, no!

27:13.715 --> 27:16.943
He's meat. He's meat!

27:43.704 --> 27:46.914
That way. The gate's that way!

27:46.915 --> 27:49.584
Run while you've still got legs!

27:49.585 --> 27:52.529
He's gone! Enough!

28:08.896 --> 28:10.292
What?

28:10.981 --> 28:14.801
Something... natural.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.426
Freeze! Aaron Boone,
you're under arrest!

28:40.427 --> 28:42.970
Boone, listen to him. It's no use.

28:42.971 --> 28:44.493
Stay back!

28:44.806 --> 28:49.456
Inspector, I know how to talk to him.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.460
Boone, it's gonna be OK.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.803
They know everything now.
I've explained everything to them.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.154
They're not gonna hurt you.

29:00.155 --> 29:03.574
I didn't do it. I didn't hurt anyone!

29:03.575 --> 29:06.974
- Of course you didn't.
- Then you believe me?

29:07.412 --> 29:08.788
I believe you.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.665
He's got a gun!

29:10.666 --> 29:13.815
No! Hold your fire!

29:14.419 --> 29:17.363
I said hold your goddamn fire!

29:44.074 --> 29:45.846
Where's the gun?

29:49.037 --> 29:51.105
He reached into his jacket.

30:29.536 --> 30:33.481
Ms. Winston, can you identify
this as the body of Aaron Boone?

30:56.396 --> 30:59.374
You know, you meant
the world to Aaron.

30:59.649 --> 31:02.468
He used to talk about
you all the time.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.613
He talked a lot about you, too.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.114
We don't have to do this
right now, Ms. Winston.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.968
No, I'd really rather
just get it over with.

31:17.334 --> 31:20.232
What was your relationship
with the deceased?

31:26.051 --> 31:27.468
We were lovers.

31:27.469 --> 31:30.429
Deceased is male,
white caucasian, late-20s.

31:30.430 --> 31:35.684
Possible cause of death multiple gunshot
wounds to thoracic cavity and extremities.

31:35.685 --> 31:40.231
Unspecified animal bite adjacent
bullet wound on upper left shoulder.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.483
Bullet wound number one,
upper left shoulder.

31:42.484 --> 31:45.569
Second bullet wound
above left nipple.

31:45.570 --> 31:48.823
Third bullet wound below
costal margin, to the left.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.472
Jesus, they weren't
taking any chances!

31:52.160 --> 31:56.355
He never raised a hand to me.
He never hurt anyone in his life.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.725
Ms. Winston...

31:59.209 --> 32:01.877
everybody has a secret face.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.650
Coffee break.

32:06.466 --> 32:08.739
Sweet dreams.

32:09.636 --> 32:13.889
Where did he die? What was
the name of the town?

32:13.890 --> 32:16.618
It was a place called Midian.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.535
Someone's taken the body!

33:30.342 --> 33:32.760
Is it always the same dream then?

33:32.761 --> 33:36.805
No, sometimes it's like I'm, uh...

33:36.806 --> 33:40.518
I don't know.
It's like I'm underground.

33:40.519 --> 33:44.563
I'm in Midian, in a place full
of monsters, being tortured by them.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.962
Are you buried alive?

33:47.108 --> 33:48.817
No. Not a lot.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.819
But you're conscious?

33:50.820 --> 33:55.470
Y-Yeah, but not alive.
I'm dead but I'm still functioning.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.303
Death is the end, Boone.

34:00.622 --> 34:04.146
But in Midian, I live forever.

34:08.088 --> 34:11.942
So maybe death isn't the end, Doc.

34:44.623 --> 34:47.601
- What'll it be, darling?
- Yeah, uh, draft.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.025
Draft coming up.

34:50.964 --> 34:53.532
I'm looking for a
place called Midian.

34:54.509 --> 34:58.554
You're not the only one. Bunch
of TV news folk passing through,

34:58.555 --> 35:01.265
ever since they nailed that
baby slasher up there.

35:01.266 --> 35:04.184
- Baby slasher?
- Yeah, been a hell of a week for us.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.913
Took 30 shots to bag that sucker.

35:10.609 --> 35:13.678
What is it? Men or money?

35:15.155 --> 35:19.100
Whenever I cry,
it's usually men or money.

35:20.327 --> 35:21.803
A man.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.935
What'd he do? Leave?

35:25.999 --> 35:29.335
- Not exactly.
- Well he didn't come back, did he?

35:29.336 --> 35:33.005
That's even worse.
Some loser gets a crush on you,

35:33.006 --> 35:35.966
you could throw him in the river,
tie him to a piano and he'd come back

35:35.967 --> 35:38.410
faster than a dog with a bone.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.807
Why I bother to look so good when
there's no one here to admire

35:43.808 --> 35:47.144
the end product is beyond me.
Know what I mean?

35:47.145 --> 35:49.873
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

35:51.024 --> 35:55.174
Do you want a drink? I want a drink.

35:58.615 --> 36:01.784
You know, I've seen men go to
a lot of trouble to get rid of a girl

36:01.785 --> 36:05.496
but uh... I've gotta say this is
the first time I've heard of a guy

36:05.497 --> 36:08.145
doing it when he was dead.

36:11.086 --> 36:14.254
They think some sick
bastard stole the body.

36:14.255 --> 36:18.884
So, what, you want to go check
out the place where he...

36:18.885 --> 36:20.953
checked out?

36:21.388 --> 36:24.082
I guess it's just a
way to say goodbye.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.829
I loved him, but you know...

36:30.772 --> 36:33.670
I don't think I ever
really understood him.

36:35.819 --> 36:39.238
Well listen, I'm not doing anything
really important tomorrow.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.240
In fact, I'm not doing
anything tomorrow.

36:41.241 --> 36:44.560
Why don't I drive up to this
place with you and check it out?

36:46.162 --> 36:50.187
- You don't have to do that.
- I know I don't have to do it but I want to.

36:51.418 --> 36:55.147
OK. Thanks.

36:57.799 --> 37:01.343
- I guess I'm gonna have to go.
- Yeah, you go get some rest.

37:01.344 --> 37:05.369
I'm gonna stay down here and
see if I can find me a good time.

37:05.557 --> 37:09.661
Who knows, maybe one of
these jerks will win the lottery.

37:09.853 --> 37:11.420
Good luck.

37:17.694 --> 37:20.797
Compliments of the gent
in the corner by the door.

37:28.830 --> 37:32.934
Well, isn't he just the
picture of sophistication.

38:07.452 --> 38:11.997
You'll enjoy this. No, really.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.458
You hit me again and I'm
gonna rip your face off.

38:14.459 --> 38:17.461
It's just a way to say
welcome to the club.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.630
I'm not so sure I want
to be in the club.

38:19.631 --> 38:23.217
You found your way back here
for the same reason I did.

38:23.218 --> 38:28.039
We belong here. There's no place
else on Earth that would take us in.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.377
Go on in.

38:41.736 --> 38:44.304
They're waiting for you.

38:49.619 --> 38:53.018
That's Lylesberg, the boss.

38:58.545 --> 39:02.945
- Who's that girl?
- Shuna Sassi. Why?

39:03.800 --> 39:07.370
- I dreamt about her.
- I dreamt him.

39:21.067 --> 39:24.152
- Who is your advocate?
- I am.

39:24.153 --> 39:26.446
Have you tutored him in the law?

39:26.447 --> 39:30.450
- Yes, he has.
- Let the advocate answer.

39:30.451 --> 39:33.019
Yes, I have.

39:33.204 --> 39:37.058
You understand what
you do, joining us here?

39:37.125 --> 39:40.836
Tonight, you leave the
natural world behind.

39:40.837 --> 39:44.840
The life you lived will be a dream.

39:44.841 --> 39:47.068
I know.

39:47.552 --> 39:52.874
The blood of Baphomet
knows all truth.

40:04.360 --> 40:08.760
Are you prepared to
be judged by the god?

40:08.865 --> 40:12.218
Yes. I am.

40:51.783 --> 40:53.851
Aaron Boone...

40:54.285 --> 40:58.185
the Tribes of the Moon embrace you.

41:11.135 --> 41:14.158
You were wonderful.

41:25.775 --> 41:28.002
Bon appetit.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.412
Hi. How's your head?

41:38.413 --> 41:40.560
Please...

41:40.832 --> 41:43.333
But it was worth it.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.294
Lori, my grandmother
always used to say

41:46.295 --> 41:48.797
"Sheryl Ann, there's a man
walking around out there

41:48.798 --> 41:52.467
with your name on his mind.
All you gotta do is run into him."

41:52.468 --> 41:56.096
Of course he happened to be checked
in here at the crossroads of the world?

41:56.097 --> 42:00.017
He's fabulous. His name is Curtis

42:00.018 --> 42:03.103
and he's a banker, and he's
just moved to Edmonton

42:03.104 --> 42:04.771
since he got his divorce.

42:04.772 --> 42:09.234
And best of all,
he thinks I'm wonderful.

42:09.235 --> 42:11.236
Sheryl, are you sure you
want to come along?

42:11.237 --> 42:12.988
Oh yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.449
Besides, Curtis has some
business to do today.

42:15.450 --> 42:19.054
But um... But we're meeting
tonight so that's okay.

42:32.133 --> 42:35.093
- My God!
- Looks like the gold rush is over.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.970
Why the hell would
Boone come out here?

42:36.971 --> 42:39.414
To get away from it all?

42:40.641 --> 42:43.209
Shut up, Sheryl Ann.

42:43.770 --> 42:48.466
Look, you go do whatever it is you
have to do and I'll stay here and...

42:48.691 --> 42:50.859
do something else.

42:50.860 --> 42:53.053
Right, I'll see you later.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.527
So this is Midian.

43:49.669 --> 43:51.441
Curtis?

43:52.130 --> 43:54.858
What are you doing here?

43:56.509 --> 43:59.077
Hello, Sheryl Ann.

44:45.683 --> 44:49.207
Bring her. Please, bring her.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.416
Don't be frightened.

45:03.367 --> 45:05.560
Pick her up.

45:06.954 --> 45:10.057
O-Okay, hold still.

45:11.292 --> 45:12.893
Come on.

45:14.337 --> 45:17.964
It's okay. It's all right.

45:17.965 --> 45:23.287
Hurry, please. Bring her.
Please, bring her to me.

45:33.439 --> 45:36.792
Pay no attention,
just give her to me.

45:37.777 --> 45:39.549
What is this?

45:40.071 --> 45:42.924
- Babette, no!
- What's happening?

45:44.158 --> 45:45.992
What, is it sick?

45:45.993 --> 45:49.472
- What's happening to it?
- Mommy, help me.

45:50.957 --> 45:52.604
Jesus...

45:53.793 --> 45:57.897
- What the hell is this?
- She likes to play outside.

45:57.922 --> 46:02.717
I tell her the sun will hurt her,
but she's just a child.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.803
She doesn't understand.

46:04.804 --> 46:07.847
- She likes to play outside...
- You saved her.

46:07.848 --> 46:10.141
I owe you something.

46:10.142 --> 46:13.541
Listen, I know why you've come.

46:18.067 --> 46:21.736
Is Boone here?
Did somebody bring him here?

46:21.737 --> 46:25.591
Rachel, you have said
too much already.

46:25.866 --> 46:29.661
But Lylesberg, she saved Babette.

46:29.662 --> 46:33.732
We know. But you cannot help her.

46:34.292 --> 46:39.421
Look... I don't know
who you people are,

46:39.422 --> 46:43.993
but I saved the
child's life, didn't I?

46:45.553 --> 46:47.637
So don't I deserve
something for that?

46:47.638 --> 46:50.582
The child has no life to save.

46:52.601 --> 46:55.979
But what it has is yours,
if you want it.

46:55.980 --> 46:59.733
That is the law. Do you want her?

46:59.734 --> 47:03.679
No! No thanks.

47:04.488 --> 47:07.115
No, I just want some answers.

47:07.116 --> 47:12.203
But to speak of this, to anyone,
would bring dire consequences.

47:12.204 --> 47:14.039
What is that, a threat?

47:14.040 --> 47:18.144
Not to you. To us.

47:18.669 --> 47:24.571
What's below... remains below.

47:24.884 --> 47:26.801
This is the law.

47:26.802 --> 47:30.305
Boone. Aaron Boone.

47:30.306 --> 47:33.500
Just tell me, is he here?

47:33.726 --> 47:36.394
You took him. You took
his body, didn't you?

47:36.395 --> 47:39.623
I need to know. Didn't you!

47:40.858 --> 47:43.902
I'm sorry. Please, don't go.

47:43.903 --> 47:46.346
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

47:52.161 --> 47:54.559
Where'd they go?

48:21.816 --> 48:23.633
She's mine!

48:31.992 --> 48:35.266
Y'all come back now, y'hear!?

48:38.624 --> 48:40.851
Sheryl, we're going.

48:41.210 --> 48:45.255
I saw, uh...
Something's kinda come up

48:45.256 --> 48:48.450
and, um, I...

48:56.934 --> 48:58.660
Sheryl?

49:34.972 --> 49:37.199
Oh my God.

49:39.852 --> 49:41.920
Oh my God.

49:48.611 --> 49:51.738
- Lori.
- How do you know my name?

49:51.739 --> 49:54.433
Oh, that's a good question.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.306
Here's the answer.

50:01.332 --> 50:03.666
Boone's alive, Lori.

50:03.667 --> 50:07.897
And your death is gonna
bring him out of hiding.

50:14.220 --> 50:17.164
Somebody help me!

50:34.698 --> 50:37.242
I'm not gonna let her die!

50:37.243 --> 50:40.161
You made an oath to obey the law.

50:40.162 --> 50:42.230
I'm not gonna let him butcher her.

50:47.711 --> 50:49.045
No!

50:49.046 --> 50:50.647
Bitch!

50:50.714 --> 50:53.132
- I love her.
- But she's a Natural.

50:53.133 --> 50:55.593
She can't love you, not now.

50:55.594 --> 50:57.571
I don't care!

51:07.898 --> 51:09.440
Boone!

51:09.441 --> 51:12.920
Boone!

51:13.362 --> 51:17.842
Lie still... It's quicker that way.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.147
Decker!

51:24.582 --> 51:26.399
You're here.

51:27.001 --> 51:29.043
Well isn't this where the
dead are supposed to go?

51:29.044 --> 51:30.587
But you're not dead.

51:30.588 --> 51:33.214
You're wrong, Decker.
We're both dead.

51:33.215 --> 51:34.782
Boone.

51:40.306 --> 51:43.409
Don't you get it?
Blades are no better than bullets.

51:45.811 --> 51:48.646
I'm dead. I'm the walking dead.

51:48.647 --> 51:50.648
Are you gonna kill him or not?

51:50.649 --> 51:55.653
Only I want his balls. And his eyes.

51:55.654 --> 51:58.072
Unless, of course, you want them?

51:58.073 --> 51:59.657
I think I'll pass.

51:59.658 --> 52:02.493
Remember me, Doctor?

52:02.494 --> 52:05.580
I was dying when you
had your way with me.

52:05.581 --> 52:10.168
You made me give up my secrets when
I was feeling particularly vulnerable.

52:10.169 --> 52:14.239
Now, is that a nice thing
for a doctor to do?

52:16.300 --> 52:17.901
He's mine!

52:29.521 --> 52:31.498
Pretty sweet.

52:34.026 --> 52:36.344
No!

52:42.034 --> 52:47.265
I wasn't gonna hurt her.
I only wanted to keep her warm.

52:49.124 --> 52:52.227
She's not gonna like
the way you look.

53:08.268 --> 53:11.396
You've put us all in danger
for your love of this woman.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.897
Decker won't tell anyone.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.751
He can still lead our enemies here.

53:16.026 --> 53:19.300
If he does, and Midian is unearthed

53:19.321 --> 53:21.322
you are responsible.

53:21.323 --> 53:23.491
I'll make amends.

53:23.492 --> 53:28.579
Just take the girl, then go on
your way amongst the Naturals.

53:28.580 --> 53:30.331
That is the law.

53:30.332 --> 53:32.750
And who made this law?

53:32.751 --> 53:36.150
Baphomet made Midian.

53:54.356 --> 53:57.425
We've got visitors, boy.

53:58.819 --> 54:01.070
Can I use your phone?

54:01.071 --> 54:04.824
Yeah, uh, don't know if it works.

54:04.825 --> 54:07.177
Broke down, did ya?

54:08.078 --> 54:10.913
You ain't gonna get
nobody to come out here.

54:10.914 --> 54:14.000
- Nobody never comes out here.
- Get me Inspector Joyce.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.148
Dr. Philip Decker.

54:16.670 --> 54:19.238
You been up to Midian?

54:21.800 --> 54:26.053
- Kind of smelt like you had.
- Where exactly is the town of Midian?

54:26.054 --> 54:28.723
There ain't no town, just cemetery.

54:28.724 --> 54:32.852
Joyce? Decker. Listen,
I found out where Boone is.

54:32.853 --> 54:35.229
- Where are the nearest police?
- Shere Neck.

54:35.230 --> 54:40.131
Shere Neck. Yes.
I'll meet you in Shere Neck.

54:42.070 --> 54:45.281
- Who's buried in Midian?
- Dead folk.

54:45.282 --> 54:48.451
Prospectors come from all
over and got buried up there.

54:48.452 --> 54:53.523
- But there's something else.
- Ain't nothin' but dead folk.

54:54.625 --> 54:56.067
Thanks.

55:11.600 --> 55:16.521
Had to happen sooner or later.
They couldn't hide forever.

55:39.461 --> 55:42.213
It's all right, boy. It's all right.

55:42.214 --> 55:44.862
Everything's gonna be all right.

55:50.430 --> 55:52.031
Boone?

56:07.030 --> 56:09.598
What the hell is this?

56:12.786 --> 56:15.913
- It was Boone up there.
- Yes.

56:15.914 --> 56:18.165
But Boone's dead,
I saw him in the morgue.

56:18.166 --> 56:23.671
You still don't understand.
You're below now, with the Nightbreed.

56:23.672 --> 56:28.050
- The last survivors of the great tribes.
- OK, tribes of what?

56:28.051 --> 56:31.095
We're shape shifters. Freaks.

56:31.096 --> 56:35.266
Remains of races that your tribe
have almost driven to extinction.

56:35.267 --> 56:37.768
- So you're not immortal?
- Far from it.

56:37.769 --> 56:41.105
The sun can kill some
of us, like Babette.

56:41.106 --> 56:43.774
Some of us can be shot down.

56:43.775 --> 56:47.778
Others can survive that because
they've gone beyond death.

56:47.779 --> 56:49.906
This is too weird.

56:49.907 --> 56:53.451
To be able to fly? To be smoke?

56:53.452 --> 56:55.202
Or a wolf?

56:55.203 --> 56:58.497
To know the night and
live in it, forever.

56:58.498 --> 57:00.625
That's not so bad.

57:00.626 --> 57:04.545
You call us monsters,
but when you dream

57:04.546 --> 57:08.215
you dream of flying, and changing

57:08.216 --> 57:11.069
and living without death.

57:11.637 --> 57:15.932
You envy us. And what you envy...

57:15.933 --> 57:18.309
We destroy.

57:18.310 --> 57:23.381
Babette? Show her. Show her the past.

58:16.284 --> 58:18.619
We are all that remain.

58:18.620 --> 58:22.832
So you're saying...
You're saying that Boone's like you.

58:22.833 --> 58:26.152
Yes. He's Nightbreed.

58:26.753 --> 58:31.757
No, that's not possible.
I've gotta find him.

58:31.758 --> 58:34.969
- He's beyond your help.
- Where did he go?

58:34.970 --> 58:37.888
Down to the tabernacle. To Baphomet.

58:37.889 --> 58:41.934
- Who's that?
- The baptizer, who made Midian

58:41.935 --> 58:44.937
who called us here and
saved us from our enemies.

58:44.938 --> 58:47.815
- OK, take me there.
- It's forbidden.

58:47.816 --> 58:49.793
We'll see about that.

58:51.319 --> 58:56.282
- I told you everything I know.
- No, no. The monsters.

58:56.283 --> 58:59.702
- Nightbreed?
- Can they die?

58:59.703 --> 59:02.163
What harm they ever done to you?

59:02.164 --> 59:04.562
Can they die!

59:05.834 --> 59:07.710
- Yeah.
- How?

59:07.711 --> 59:14.175
Well, there are all kinds of breed.
All kinds of ways to kill them.

59:14.176 --> 59:19.638
Uh, b-bullets for some,
and f-fire for others.

59:19.639 --> 59:22.958
Why is it that you know
so much about them?

59:23.268 --> 59:26.621
I wanted to be one of them.

59:28.190 --> 59:33.296
Did they kick you out? Is that
why you hate them so much?

59:33.820 --> 59:38.891
I'm not one of them.
I'm here to destroy them.

59:38.992 --> 59:43.454
See, I've cleaned up
a lot of breeders.

59:43.455 --> 59:48.959
Families like cesspools.
Filth making filth, making filth.

59:48.960 --> 59:53.214
And I did it over,
and over, and over again.

59:53.215 --> 59:56.634
But it was all leading me here.

59:56.635 --> 01:00:00.805
I was born to destroy Boone
and the breed together.

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:04.892
- You're crazy!
- No, I'm death.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.291
Plain and simple.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:09.209
Say it!

01:00:16.404 --> 01:00:18.381
Then don't say it.

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:25.871
- You may go no further.
- Where's Boone?

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:30.042
Boone is with Baphomet.
He is beyond recall.

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:33.567
Just tell me where the tabernacle is.
I'll go get him myself.

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:37.446
OK... I'm gonna go find Boone

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:41.196
and I don't think you're
gonna try and stop me.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:51.747
Excuse me.

01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:18.520
There goes the neighborhood.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.288
Looking for Boone?

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:59.519
Boone?

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.903
Boone!

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:11.489
Dammit, Boone.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:15.994
No one here with that name.

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:30.175
I know you. He's talked about you.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:33.261
Lori.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:37.231
Pretty little butterfly. Nice.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:42.191
You're still a Natural.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.199
- Wanna join the family?
- No!

01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:53.639
Sooner or later,
you'll want to live forever.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.366
No!

01:04:56.684 --> 01:05:00.020
- OK, Decker, what have you got?
- I found Boone.

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:02.272
Somebody stole the corpse,
brought it down here?

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:05.626
There is no corpse. He's not dead.

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:08.654
He was shot full of bullets.
I saw him.

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:12.908
I saw it too, but he's alive.
He's killed again.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:16.979
- In Shere Neck?
- No. No, up in Midian.

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:18.643
Gentlemen.

01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:22.751
Captain Eigerman.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.629
Inspector Joyce,
Calgary Police Department.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:26.880
And this is Dr. Decker.

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:29.967
And this is Shere Neck.
Midian is my jurisdiction.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:33.595
Boone was my prisoner.
We can work together.

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.098
No we can't.
I'll bring him in myself.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:39.810
- But he's not alone anymore.
- I've heard that talk.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.895
It's nuthouse talk.

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:44.523
- What talk?
- Midian.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:48.360
Something is breeding there.
Underneath the cemetery.

01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:49.653
Bullshit.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:51.864
- You believe that?
- Yes I do.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:55.389
And if somebody doesn't stop them,
there's gonna be a lot more bloodshed.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:57.682
I promise.

01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:00.873
Hey, you're very light on your feet.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:06.822
You may not be gorgeous,
but you'll do for me.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.630
Hoppin' about already?

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.216
- Just stay away from me.
- Hey, I'm sorry about upstairs

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:15.287
but I do see your pretty face
and I just had to kiss it.

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:19.099
- Hey, you can't go down there!
- Why not?

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.686
Isn't this a great place?
Shangri-la on dope.

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:24.354
We love it!

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.064
What's that smell?

01:06:26.065 --> 01:06:29.134
Not me.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.422
The Berserkers are down there!

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:37.284
Mad bastards...

01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:40.913
They'll rip off your head
and shit down your neck!

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:44.583
- Did Boone go down there?
- And he won't be coming back.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:47.169
- He's not dead?
- He's more than that.

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.880
If you don't believe me,
just wait until he comes to

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:52.508
sniff a little blood!

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:55.237
That'll bring out the beast in him!

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:57.454
You can't go down there!

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:02.292
You need some beauty sleep.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:08.670
Hey... Love those tattoos.

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:13.549
Sailors.

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.021
Help me.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:37.511
Get back here!

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:38.845
Come back!

01:07:38.846 --> 01:07:41.540
Hey! Shine!

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:46.041
Slaughter! You missed!

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.692
- Where's Boone?
- This way.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.265
Boone!

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:15.448
Don't look.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:18.660
Don't look!

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:35.885
Come on!

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:40.140
Well well, guess he
can't take the heat.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.841
Thank God. Let's go.

01:08:58.843 --> 01:09:02.095
I can't go out there. I belong here.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:05.950
Now listen to me. You belong with me.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.810
That's why you lived.
That's why we both survived.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.104
Because we belong together.

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:15.334
Don't you see they don't need you?

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.928
Nobody needs you but me.

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:24.810
I love you. Come on.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:44.872
There's no answer from the room.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.870
I tried twice.

01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:49.743
Huh?

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.622
Yeah, the key's still here.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.149
I don't know, I haven't seen them.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:10:01.881
Arnie! Hey, Arnie!
Where the fuck is he?

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:04.241
Arnie!

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:07.311
Listen, I'm gonna have to get
someone back to you on that...

01:10:07.328 --> 01:10:08.578
OK.

01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:10.226
Yeah.

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.275
Oh, shit.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:20.988
Oh God, what a mess.

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:32.495
Gross me out.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.008
Arnie?

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:12.919
OK, come on. I'll get my
stuff in two minutes.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:24.529
- What's wrong?
- Why's it so empty?

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.552
Must be the rodeo.

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:32.058
I smell blood.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:40.316
It's OK.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.956
Shere Neck Police.

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.020
Boone!

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:23.276
Next door...

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:03.062
It was Decker.

01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:05.439
Decker did this.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:15.515
Boone, what's wrong? What is it?

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.560
I don't want you to see. Get out!

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:21.146
Boone, I'm not gonna leave you!

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:22.919
Get in! Go! Go!

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:42.234
They're coming!

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.002
Go!

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:08.919
Freeze!

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:12.197
Up, up, up! Get him up!

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:14.971
Christ, he stinks.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:21.223
What are you looking at?

01:14:23.501 --> 01:14:24.818
Move.

01:14:25.836 --> 01:14:27.232
Captain?

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:35.572
You are a freak and a cannibal.
And you've come to the wrong town.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:38.848
Get the door.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:42.077
I'm gonna give you something
to remember me by.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.654
Fucking cannibal.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:14.067
Creep.

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:26.730
Put him in my custody right now!

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:29.357
- Still here, huh?
- I'm gonna go back to Midian with you.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.738
Yeah... I'll be right there.

01:15:34.739 --> 01:15:38.158
Well I'm not going anywhere with you,
I've got a press conference to deal with.

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:40.452
You tell him I've got
Boone under control.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:43.872
Don't trust him. He changes.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.474
Sure he does.

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:48.977
Eigerman!

01:15:49.336 --> 01:15:51.588
- He was right about the motel.
- So what?

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:55.175
- So maybe there are others.
- What are you talking about, monsters?

01:15:55.176 --> 01:15:57.635
A cult, I don't know.
We should check it out.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:59.179
- You wanna go out there?
- Yeah.

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:01.222
- OK, we'll go out there. Pettine.
- Yo Chief.

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:04.559
You and some of the boys take
Inspector Joyce here out to Midian.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.561
When you get out there,
look around that graveyard.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.230
You see anything with more than
two eyes, give me a holler.

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:12.175
In the mean time I've got a
press conference. Goodbye.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.696
Hey! Doctor's here to
examine you, freak

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:20.050
just so no one can say
we laid one finger on you.

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:23.557
He looks okay to me.

01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:26.227
What do you think, Doc?

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:45.266
No pulse.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.915
- What's that?
- The man is dead.

01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:57.654
Has Boone made a confession?

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.490
They found traces of
human flesh in his system.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:02.117
Does that answer your question?

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:05.578
- Cannibalism?
- Sounds like that, doesn't it sweetheart?

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:11.026
Is this the same Aaron Boone that was
shot down in Midian four days ago?

01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:13.503
What are you talking about?

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:17.825
The man that was shot in
Midian was Aaron Boone.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:25.456
Excuse me.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.439
What the hell are you
trying to do to me!?

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:35.942
I don't understand what the
hell's going on around here!

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:39.717
Now how many bullets did they
pull out of that geek up in Midian?

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.448
- Why?
- Why? You tell him why!

01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:45.518
- I can't get a pulse on him.
- Jesus Christ!

01:17:45.536 --> 01:17:46.744
Are you saying he's dead?

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:51.958
Not lying down dead, my friend.
Walkin' around in my fuckin' cell dead!

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:54.687
Now what do you got
to say about that?

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:03.928
Christ. You can hide an army in here.

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:08.784
- What exactly are we looking for, Sarge?
- We're here to kick some major league butt.

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:14.272
- We're here to scout, not engage.
- What about if they engage us?

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:16.045
What about that?

01:18:18.777 --> 01:18:22.256
There's people down there.
I can feel it.

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:26.868
Why don't we shoot them in their graves?
Save us digging new ones.

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:31.599
I don't know, maybe we're all just spooked.
Who would want to live in a graveyard?

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:35.501
What do you say, Inspector?
Let's just call it a day.

01:18:35.502 --> 01:18:37.354
Head for home!

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:42.450
No, no, no! Ahhh!

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:53.311
You want we should
interrogate it, Inspector?

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:56.022
- Give him some air.
- What the hell for?

01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:58.546
Can't you see there's
something wrong with him?

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:04.465
- Help me, please!
- Get him off me!

01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:08.305
Get off me!

01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:40.175
- Jesus...
- Christ on a crutch.

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.544
He was just dust?

01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:49.347
It was the sun. The sun did it.

01:19:49.660 --> 01:19:53.184
We've got the perfect weapon,
right over our heads.

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:58.273
Yeah... Just until it goes down.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:14.035
Oh no. Shit! Pettine!
Goddammit, get out here!

01:20:16.854 --> 01:20:17.770
Who did it?

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:21.107
Pettine, what's your status?

01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:24.086
They torched our car! Lousy freaks!

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.722
Kane, get in here.

01:20:28.282 --> 01:20:29.532
Yes, sir?

01:20:29.533 --> 01:20:31.931
I think it's about time we
go out there, don't you?

01:20:32.578 --> 01:20:35.788
Reverend Ashberry,
your services are required.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:37.081
He looks like a drunk.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.625
He is a drunk, lost his way
the poor son of a bitch.

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:42.337
Now you wouldn't want to miss
the Judgment Day, would you?

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:45.798
The Apocalypse? It's here?

01:20:45.799 --> 01:20:47.925
They're warming up
for it over at Midian.

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:51.346
What I want you to do is go over
to your church, get crosses,

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:55.497
and prayer books, and Bibles,
and whatever the hell else you people use.

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:58.644
'Cause we're going out
there with God on our side.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:07.111
Officer Kane, show him.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.554
OK.

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:16.204
We've got your spankin' new H and K G3
.308 NATO semi-automatic assault rifle.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:19.775
Blowback action and
retractable bipods.

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:24.230
For standard combat
firepower, can't beat it.

01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:30.968
For the sportsman in the crowd...

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:35.665
we carry this handy pump-action
Frenchie eliminator.

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:38.226
This is the lightweight
single barrel size.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:41.771
A perfect gift selection
for ladies and juniors.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:45.672
That's fabulous, really. Terrific.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:53.513
You can always count
on friendly garrote.

01:21:55.494 --> 01:22:00.540
Whether it's Commies, freaks or Third
World Y-chromosome mutants, we are there.

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:02.939
Sons of the free.

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.964
Hey, freak-face, we found your pals.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:10.363
And they're gonna fry, just like you.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.254
Please, get in.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:27.213
- Rachel?
- Lori, now.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:36.017
- What?
- Close the door.

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:38.870
OK, what?

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:41.664
We have to get Boone back,
Midian needs him.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.624
Why? What can he do?

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:47.044
He went into Baphomet's chamber.
He spoke to the baptizer.

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:49.338
And survived.
Nobody ever did that before.

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:53.259
Maybe Baphomet told him something,
something that could save Midian.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.679
Hey, Constable Labowitz,
something to blow your brains?

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.389
- Beauties.
- All right!

01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:59.307
Suck on that.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:01.917
Hey, who's there?

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:05.501
What's the problem?

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.457
No problem!

01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:09.463
Shit!

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:13.755
Hold him!

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:19.435
You all right, Coback?

01:23:21.705 --> 01:23:24.040
Where is he? Where's Boone?

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:26.834
Cell 3, through the door.

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.779
I love a coward!

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:33.758
Don't think you're
getting sprung, freak!

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:36.677
No way they get through
that door, it's solid steel!

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.530
You hear me, freak!?

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.626
Jesus Christ!

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.751
Ray!

01:24:03.872 --> 01:24:07.146
I do not want to hurt you.

01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:29.130
Naughty, naughty.

01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:34.419
- I want you to wait out here.
- Brave girl.

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:45.980
Boone?

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:54.568
Stay away from me.

01:24:55.132 --> 01:24:56.904
I'll hurt you.

01:24:57.759 --> 01:25:03.411
I don't think so. Whatever you
are, I'm not afraid of you.

01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:43.704
No time for hoochie-coochie.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.334
Are we going?

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:53.898
So Moses spoke to the people saying,

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:58.069
"Arm yourselves for war and let them
go and take vengeance for the Lord"

01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:59.779
"...on Midian."

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:03.199
"And so they burned with fire
all the cities where they dwelt"

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.304
"and killed the kings of Midian,
both man and beast."

01:26:07.537 --> 01:26:12.333
Ooo, Doc, it sounds like we're going
head-to-head with the Devil himself.

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:16.984
- I don't believe in the Devil.
- Oh, but you will.

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:30.501
Alright, let's move in.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:39.568
Plastic explosives at every intersection.
Tripwires outside the biggest tombs.

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:41.570
Figure those will be the
major escape routes.

01:26:41.571 --> 01:26:43.572
- How much time?
- Five minutes.

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:46.409
All right, pull back to the
perimeter before we lose the light

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.637
- ...there's movement underground.
- Captain.

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:52.581
Stop! Jesus, Reverend, not there.

01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:55.526
We've got claymores planted
in the undergrowth.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:27:00.381
We've made a mistake.
There's no evil.

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:04.677
No, you're not listening to me!
It's wrong, it's sacrilege!

01:27:04.678 --> 01:27:09.306
- This is holy ground!
- Go back to the perimeter, you pinhead.

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:12.226
You brought me here because
I'm a man of God and...

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:15.896
Hang around here any longer and
you'll be sitting in his left hand.

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:19.876
No you get the fuck out of here,
you sorry son of a bitch.

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:26.133
Claymore's gonna cut his nuts
off faster than a hedge clipper.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:38.444
Move it! Move it, move it!

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:42.611
Only a mile or two more.

01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.038
What are you doing here, Decker?

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.040
You'll miss all the fun.

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:55.394
There's a shortcut near here.

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:57.793
- Where?
- Now!

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:02.259
Found it!

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:08.850
I just... I just found something in there I
really think you ought to take a look at.

01:28:14.372 --> 01:28:16.519
What the hell is this, Decker?

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:36.957
T-minus ten seconds.

01:28:40.023 --> 01:28:45.379
Five... four... three...
two... one...

01:28:51.201 --> 01:28:53.303
We are too late.

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:15.913
Looks like the millennium just ended.

01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:48.532
Die, you fucker!

01:30:10.614 --> 01:30:12.716
Bastards.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.973
- Rachel!
- Babette!

01:30:25.879 --> 01:30:29.340
Stay down. Stay where you are!

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:32.051
- They're waiting for us above!
- No!

01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:35.095
Don't listen to him or
we'll all be slaughtered.

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:39.266
- This is our home.
- If you want to live, it won't be here.

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:41.101
And it won't be by your laws.

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:44.605
Now if we want to survive we've got
to fight back, we can't hide anymore.

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:47.399
Take the children above ground.
Find a hiding place.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:49.877
What about Baphomet, can he be moved?

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.237
Can he be moved!?

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:55.933
- Yes, it could be done.
- It must be done.

01:30:56.076 --> 01:31:00.245
Brothers and sisters...
It is time to fight.

01:31:00.246 --> 01:31:02.689
Outstanding.

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:05.960
Come on!

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:08.754
- Don't look down.
- Come on, hurry! Hurry!

01:31:08.755 --> 01:31:10.756
Women and children upstairs.

01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:13.968
- You heard what he said.
- What chance have we got?

01:31:13.969 --> 01:31:17.368
- They're armed.
- So am I.

01:31:18.598 --> 01:31:20.950
Come to daddy.

01:31:36.574 --> 01:31:38.642
You're with God now.

01:31:52.716 --> 01:31:57.094
Arm yourselves! Defend yourselves!

01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:58.637
You're not cattle for Christ sake.

01:31:58.638 --> 01:32:01.161
You're gonna need
weapons, all of you.

01:32:29.836 --> 01:32:34.407
If you can't do it for yourselves,
do it for your children.

01:32:55.945 --> 01:32:58.764
Come on! This way!

01:33:02.368 --> 01:33:03.890
No!

01:33:27.852 --> 01:33:30.796
Babette... Come on.

01:33:32.232 --> 01:33:35.756
Hey! My lucky day!

01:33:36.694 --> 01:33:39.046
Come on, she's just a kid!

01:33:56.256 --> 01:33:58.073
You found her.

01:34:01.511 --> 01:34:04.054
Look what we got here.

01:34:04.055 --> 01:34:05.952
Say goodnight.

01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:17.093
You've got to stop!

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:23.016
There are children down there...
You're killing children!

01:34:26.119 --> 01:34:28.221
Go ahead, faggot.

01:34:31.624 --> 01:34:33.020
Don't!

01:34:33.668 --> 01:34:34.918
Sorry, Padre.

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:37.396
Eigerman!

01:34:41.092 --> 01:34:43.660
We don't like priests here.

01:34:44.345 --> 01:34:45.846
Get out.

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:48.165
- Run!
- No.

01:34:48.474 --> 01:34:52.203
I have to see. Take me with you.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:01.216
Ow!

01:35:03.406 --> 01:35:05.849
What the fuck is this?

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.198
What is it?

01:35:39.484 --> 01:35:41.176
Kane!

01:36:11.683 --> 01:36:15.227
What in the hell are you doing
down here? Your people need you!

01:36:15.228 --> 01:36:19.398
Baphomet is going to destroy us all.
The Naturals, the Breed, Midian.

01:36:19.399 --> 01:36:21.400
- Everything!
- How do you know?

01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:23.799
Take a look for yourself.

01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:29.491
The whole place is gonna blow?

01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:32.786
- It's Baphomet's will.
- Look, we can make it out.

01:36:32.787 --> 01:36:36.164
- But we need fighters.
- We're not warriors.

01:36:36.165 --> 01:36:40.127
- What about the Berserkers?
- Madness, they're uncontrollable.

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:42.526
Better yet, let them out.

01:36:42.547 --> 01:36:46.758
We are the Tribes of
the Moon. You said so.

01:36:46.759 --> 01:36:49.487
The Tribes of the Moon.

01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:53.449
I'll release them.

01:36:57.395 --> 01:37:00.022
You take the big guy.

01:37:00.023 --> 01:37:01.875
Sucker.

01:37:12.744 --> 01:37:17.122
- You don't want to do that.
- Gimme a good reason why not.

01:37:17.123 --> 01:37:19.191
I'll give you two.

01:37:31.304 --> 01:37:32.655
What a mess.

01:37:37.727 --> 01:37:40.329
Yo! Moses!

01:37:41.522 --> 01:37:43.169
Wait for it...

01:39:25.501 --> 01:39:27.444
Holy shit!

01:39:44.729 --> 01:39:46.171
Slop!

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:50.000
You goddamn cowards!

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:58.638
I'll kill you all!

01:39:59.452 --> 01:40:01.953
You! Gimme a weapon!

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:26.749
Lori.

01:40:27.563 --> 01:40:31.107
I didn't believe in the prophecies.

01:40:31.108 --> 01:40:34.712
- It's all over.
- What prophecies?

01:40:35.196 --> 01:40:37.343
You want to see?

01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:48.291
- That's Boone.
- Yes, it's him.

01:40:48.292 --> 01:40:52.772
All these years waiting for a savior.

01:40:52.838 --> 01:40:57.425
He hasn't saved us.
He's destroyed us.

01:40:57.426 --> 01:40:59.719
I made him.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:03.390
The bite... was mine.

01:41:03.391 --> 01:41:08.667
- The bite that mocks death.
- That doesn't make him yours.

01:41:16.779 --> 01:41:18.572
Quite a dance, huh?

01:41:18.573 --> 01:41:21.346
Death everywhere and
you and me in the middle.

01:41:25.454 --> 01:41:27.180
Come on!

01:42:18.341 --> 01:42:20.488
Come on!

01:42:27.642 --> 01:42:28.993
Boone!

01:42:42.615 --> 01:42:44.558
Not yet.

01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:57.522
One last dance?

01:43:09.058 --> 01:43:11.126
Oh my God.

01:43:12.478 --> 01:43:15.046
Decker's dead.

01:43:17.108 --> 01:43:19.506
Pull the knife out.

01:43:30.329 --> 01:43:32.852
No!

01:43:37.086 --> 01:43:38.528
Don't go.

01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:44.409
I have to. I'm responsible.

01:44:44.361 --> 01:44:50.263
You have destroyed our refuge.
This was inevitable.

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:56.857
No home is forever. You must
rebuild what you've destroyed.

01:44:56.874 --> 01:45:03.046
You must find me... Heal me...
Save me from my enemies.

01:45:03.047 --> 01:45:05.381
You are no longer Boone.

01:45:05.382 --> 01:45:08.280
You are Cabal.

01:45:09.512 --> 01:45:12.490
Save me from my enemies.

01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:15.959
Save me from my enemies.

01:46:16.036 --> 01:46:18.138
My God...

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:47.133
What have you done!

01:48:02.351 --> 01:48:05.079
I've gotta start out tonight.

01:48:08.357 --> 01:48:10.425
I'll go with you.

01:48:12.444 --> 01:48:15.217
I belong to the Breed now.

01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:17.848
Then make me belong too.

01:48:19.243 --> 01:48:21.536
They made you one of them,
you can do the same for me.

01:48:21.537 --> 01:48:23.013
I can't.

01:48:25.207 --> 01:48:27.775
But I want to be with you.

01:48:31.547 --> 01:48:34.445
I'll come back for you
when I'm finished.

01:48:37.678 --> 01:48:40.121
When's that gonna be?

01:48:40.681 --> 01:48:43.750
When I'm 90 and you're
still the way you are?

01:48:43.892 --> 01:48:47.712
I went through hell to find
you and you're just...

01:48:49.606 --> 01:48:51.924
You're just gonna walk away.

01:48:53.068 --> 01:48:56.547
Just go, then. Just go.

01:48:58.699 --> 01:49:00.767
Get out of here!

01:49:02.077 --> 01:49:04.179
What do you want?

01:49:05.122 --> 01:49:06.769
Go!

01:49:16.884 --> 01:49:18.531
Boone.

01:49:20.137 --> 01:49:22.410
Lori, no!

01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:34.635
I lied. I'm sorry.

01:49:36.612 --> 01:49:39.180
You're all I want.

01:49:39.364 --> 01:49:42.433
Please, don't die.

01:49:43.035 --> 01:49:46.104
Then do something, dammit.

01:49:48.165 --> 01:49:50.893
Remember what you said.

01:50:05.516 --> 01:50:11.418
Lori? Please...
Don't let it be too late.

01:50:14.024 --> 01:50:15.796
No...

01:50:19.655 --> 01:50:23.304
No!

01:50:24.368 --> 01:50:25.890
No!

01:50:44.179 --> 01:50:47.623
You said you'd never leave me.

01:51:25.137 --> 01:51:27.865
I saw their god.

01:51:28.515 --> 01:51:30.287
I saw him.

01:51:33.812 --> 01:51:37.732
I can still smell him.
He's out there.

01:51:40.235 --> 01:51:42.087
Oh yes.

01:51:46.074 --> 01:51:49.598
- We'll go together.
- No, they're mine.

01:51:50.787 --> 01:51:53.560
You got burned, mate.

01:51:53.665 --> 01:51:57.690
Now I'm burning back. All of 'em.

01:51:58.462 --> 01:52:01.485
Burn them all away.

01:52:04.927 --> 01:52:07.495
Take me with you.

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:52.327
Who will come for us?

01:52:52.683 --> 01:52:55.251
His name is Cabal.

01:52:55.352 --> 01:52:59.422
He... unmade Midian.

01:53:00.107 --> 01:53:01.959
How soon?

01:53:02.818 --> 01:53:08.299
In the next wind.
If not tonight, then tomorrow.

01:53:08.573 --> 01:53:11.016
On the next wind.
