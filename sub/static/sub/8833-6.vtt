WEBVTT

00:00.324 --> 00:02.840
Lorenzo's lost blood, I'm
gonna give him some of mine.

00:02.841 --> 00:04.842
I feared I'd lost you.
Where am I?

00:04.910 --> 00:06.844
You're where you belong.

00:06.912 --> 00:09.780
There is goodness in you,
there is grace.

00:09.848 --> 00:12.616
No one looks on me
and sees grace.

00:12.684 --> 00:14.218
I do.

00:14.286 --> 00:16.554
Storm on the way, could push us
into the rocks.

00:16.621 --> 00:18.622
This is not how I saw us finding
your new world.

00:20.225 --> 00:23.461
Nico!
Not everyone abandoned him.

00:23.528 --> 00:28.132
You dare enter Naples unannounced
and meet with my wife in secret?

00:28.200 --> 00:31.969
All must earn a seat
at my table.

00:32.037 --> 00:33.204
Call it a game.

00:33.271 --> 00:35.172
Make me a full partner
in your plan.

00:35.240 --> 00:38.442
The Sword of Osman Gazi.
I'm taking it with me.

00:38.510 --> 00:41.078
They came here when
I was just a little girl.

00:41.146 --> 00:43.013
We called them the Sun
and the Moon.

00:43.081 --> 00:45.216
It is her face
I see in yours.

00:45.283 --> 00:48.385
She came for the Book of Leaves.
My mother.

01:58.123 --> 02:01.992
My dreamer. Soon you will enter
the Vault of Heaven.

02:07.299 --> 02:08.933
I feared I'd lost you.

02:13.104 --> 02:15.940
I've been here before.

02:20.946 --> 02:25.115
There is only one way to enter
the Vault of Heaven, Leonardo.

02:25.183 --> 02:29.486
You must become
one with me forever.

02:29.554 --> 02:32.189
Your secrets, mine.

02:32.257 --> 02:33.891
And my secrets, yours.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.526
So...

02:38.697 --> 02:39.930
Is this...

02:39.998 --> 02:42.800
a marriage proposal?

02:42.867 --> 02:45.903
Are you devoted
to another?

02:45.971 --> 02:47.738
No.

03:20.038 --> 03:23.474
Topa believes you will die
in the trials ahead.

03:23.541 --> 03:25.142
And he may be right.

03:26.277 --> 03:28.045
He will make the ceremony
binding us

03:28.113 --> 03:30.547
as grueling
as possible.

03:30.615 --> 03:34.685
He wants the Book always
to remain in the Vault.

03:34.753 --> 03:37.721
But why would the Book
still be in the Vault?

03:37.789 --> 03:40.858
When my mother left here, why
didn't she take it with her?

03:40.925 --> 03:44.228
You mistake my words.

03:44.295 --> 03:47.064
I said she went
in the Vault.

03:47.132 --> 03:49.433
I never said
she left it.

03:57.876 --> 03:59.743
Not an inch further.

04:03.014 --> 04:05.616
You can't have any idea
what kind of man he is.

04:05.684 --> 04:08.485
I have attended him
for years.

04:08.553 --> 04:11.121
I speak your language,
thanks to him.

04:11.189 --> 04:13.624
He is a man much like
Da Vinci.

04:13.692 --> 04:15.893
They're both dangerous,
that's as far as it goes.

04:15.960 --> 04:19.663
He released me from slavery,

04:19.731 --> 04:23.734
as your friend
has made men free.

04:23.802 --> 04:26.370
He has seen others die
for his goals

04:26.438 --> 04:29.807
just as Da Vinci has.

04:29.874 --> 04:31.842
And they need each other.

04:31.910 --> 04:33.143
If it's come to
a point where Da Vinci

04:33.211 --> 04:35.612
needs that
twisted shitheel,

04:35.680 --> 04:38.415
you might as well choke me
to death yourself.

04:38.483 --> 04:40.684
You will never
understand him.

04:40.752 --> 04:42.753
There we agree.

04:50.128 --> 04:52.963
Aargh!

04:53.031 --> 04:55.432
Focus past the pain.

05:02.774 --> 05:04.675
Aargh!

05:07.846 --> 05:09.413
Aargh!

05:12.884 --> 05:14.685
Tell me about my wife.

05:16.121 --> 05:18.021
Aargh!

05:23.294 --> 05:25.462
What was Ippolita like,

05:25.530 --> 05:28.565
when you first saw her?

05:28.633 --> 05:33.070
What did you have
that charmed her?

05:33.138 --> 05:35.072
Heroics?

05:35.140 --> 05:37.975
Poetry?

05:38.042 --> 05:40.611
Money?

05:40.678 --> 05:42.513
What did the trick?

05:42.580 --> 05:47.484
Alfonso, it was
a very long time ago.

05:47.552 --> 05:48.952
Aargh!

05:49.020 --> 05:50.988
Not for her!

05:51.055 --> 05:53.023
She is married to a duke,

05:53.091 --> 05:57.995
but still dreams of her past
with a common money-lender.

06:00.031 --> 06:03.534
You send two whispered
words to Ippolita,

06:03.601 --> 06:06.870
and she comes running
like a bitch for its master.

06:12.710 --> 06:16.280
I want to know
how you won her.

06:17.849 --> 06:19.917
Every detail.

06:21.586 --> 06:24.021
It was simple.

06:24.789 --> 06:27.624
With my tongue.

06:40.238 --> 06:42.172
Filthy fucking Florentine!

06:42.240 --> 06:44.208
You've forgotten your place.

06:44.275 --> 06:49.179
You've forgotten
where you are, Magnifico.

06:49.247 --> 06:52.149
This is not Florence.

07:03.127 --> 07:05.095
This is Naples!

07:05.163 --> 07:09.900
Where your little ploys of
finance count for nothing!

07:09.968 --> 07:15.806
Where the depravity of your
artists will not stand.

07:15.874 --> 07:21.445
Where the only truly
holy things are strength...

07:21.512 --> 07:24.047
..and a good aim.

08:08.726 --> 08:10.460
I'm sorry,
what's happening?

08:10.528 --> 08:13.497
Topa Inca requires the most
demanding of the rituals.

08:13.564 --> 08:17.768
Only this will allow Leonardo to
enter the Vault of Heaven

08:17.835 --> 08:19.202
as my mate.

08:19.270 --> 08:21.138
Mate?

08:21.205 --> 08:23.674
Sorry, this is your wedding day,
Leo, is it?

08:23.741 --> 08:25.776
Mm-hm.

08:29.914 --> 08:35.686
I give this to you with
whom I will share my life.

08:42.927 --> 08:44.561
I have nothing
to give to you.

08:48.099 --> 08:50.467
Perhaps this.

09:03.648 --> 09:06.116
Speak the words
I spoke to you.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.588
'I give this to you.

09:11.656 --> 09:15.559
With whom I will share
my life.'

09:17.996 --> 09:19.763
Next.

09:19.831 --> 09:23.767
One of your friends must be
willing to spill blood on your behalf.

09:23.835 --> 09:25.869
Their own blood
or someone else's?

09:25.937 --> 09:27.337
That depends upon them.

09:29.774 --> 09:34.011
You are best suited to spill
blood for your companion.

09:34.078 --> 09:36.413
She's a good judge of character,
I'll give her that.

09:39.917 --> 09:42.686
If there is risk to him
involved...

09:42.754 --> 09:44.221
let me do it.

09:44.288 --> 09:48.358
No.
I can do what is required.

09:48.426 --> 09:51.895
I require
that you remain safe.

09:51.963 --> 09:55.265
God will protect me.

10:01.272 --> 10:02.372
Lorenzo.

10:02.440 --> 10:05.108
Lorenzo!

10:05.176 --> 10:06.843
This is Vezzi.

10:06.911 --> 10:09.713
He knows something
of Ferrante's game.

10:09.781 --> 10:12.049
The King subjects those
who would petition him

10:12.116 --> 10:14.384
to perform a kind of feat.

10:14.452 --> 10:16.720
They say it has something
to do with archery.

10:16.788 --> 10:18.532
You, Lorenzo, are a trained
bowman.

10:18.533 --> 10:22.918
<i>You are mediocre with a bow</i>
<i>on your best of days, Lorenzo.</i>

10:22.919 --> 10:26.333
<i>This hardly qualifies</i>
<i>as your best of days.</i>

10:26.334 --> 10:28.815
Who would speak to me
in this way?

10:28.816 --> 10:31.618
Come on, then.
Out of the shadows with you.

10:31.686 --> 10:35.822
Boo! Hello, brother.

10:35.890 --> 10:40.260
Lorenzo? Lorenzo.

10:40.328 --> 10:43.530
Lorenzo, I tried.
Alfonso, he hates you.

10:43.598 --> 10:47.701
The game.
Ask her about the game.

10:47.768 --> 10:49.736
How do I win this...

10:49.804 --> 10:52.339
game of his?

10:53.774 --> 10:55.442
I do not know.

10:55.509 --> 10:57.877
It is a death trap designed
by my father-in-law

10:57.945 --> 11:02.349
to convince him God is on his
side in all affairs of state.

11:02.416 --> 11:06.686
A noose around your neck
connects to a horse inspired to run.

11:06.754 --> 11:08.922
You'll be given a bow
and a single arrow.

11:08.990 --> 11:13.326
You must, with that arrow,
kill the horse before it snaps your neck.

11:16.230 --> 11:17.764
It's impossible.

11:17.832 --> 11:19.466
Nearly.

11:19.533 --> 11:22.669
Only one man has
successfully beaten it.

11:22.737 --> 11:25.338
Alfonso.

11:25.406 --> 11:26.773
His own son?

11:26.841 --> 11:29.503
And this is the man
you thought you could negotiate with?

11:29.504 --> 11:31.472
There is another way, though..

11:31.539 --> 11:34.875
A third option between the
impossible and the brutal.

11:35.048 --> 11:36.808
You will be given a bow and arrow

11:36.833 --> 11:39.454
and be in clear line
of sight of King Ferrante.

11:39.646 --> 11:43.744
You will have the chance to kill Ferrante
before you yourself are slain.

11:44.505 --> 11:46.473
It will not save you.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.409
But it will make me
Queen of Naples.

11:49.477 --> 11:52.239
Then I can remove
Alfonso myself

11:52.264 --> 11:54.259
to end the war
between our homes.

11:55.483 --> 11:57.717
So...kill a wild horse...

11:57.785 --> 12:00.720
or assassinate a mad king
with a single shot,

12:00.788 --> 12:03.823
whilst a noose dangles
at my neck?

12:05.660 --> 12:07.661
Excellent.

12:09.664 --> 12:11.798
It's all I have to offer.

12:14.902 --> 12:19.873
It's not quite the diplomatic
conclave you imagined, is it?

12:39.894 --> 12:42.300
Viracocha is the creator

12:42.325 --> 12:44.104
who brought our people
to this land.

12:45.032 --> 12:49.235
Leonardo, you must offer your flesh
to the animals who attend him.

12:50.571 --> 12:53.139
This way. Come.

13:05.653 --> 13:07.976
Now what?

13:11.225 --> 13:12.492
Ima?

13:12.560 --> 13:16.096
Like coils of serpents, both of
your fates are entwined.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.131
How very poetic.

13:18.199 --> 13:21.596
Listen, tonight you must

13:21.621 --> 13:23.488
make your way through
the cornfield,

13:23.489 --> 13:27.358
where three predators
will hunger for your blood.

13:27.426 --> 13:32.030
Show no mercy.
They will show none to you.

13:32.097 --> 13:35.366
Before the morning sun
hits the ritual altar,

13:35.434 --> 13:37.368
you must defeat
one final guardian

13:37.436 --> 13:39.370
to claim the antidote.

13:39.438 --> 13:42.373
Agh!

13:42.441 --> 13:44.142
Maestro!

13:45.644 --> 13:50.448
Unless Leonardo is purified,
he will die.

13:50.516 --> 13:54.719
And they will all be sacrificed
and I'll be helpless to stop it.

13:54.787 --> 13:57.422
And these predators
you speak of?

13:57.489 --> 13:59.457
How exactly do you
expect me to...

13:59.525 --> 14:04.272
Tonight we feed the earth,
either with your blood or theirs.

14:11.303 --> 14:14.739
My horse is tired.
Let's stop for a rest.

14:20.279 --> 14:22.246
I said, let's stop.

14:22.314 --> 14:25.483
The horse is not tired,
you are not tired.

14:25.551 --> 14:26.784
No?

14:26.852 --> 14:30.154
You hesitate because we're
so close to Constantinople,

14:30.222 --> 14:32.190
the goal you
and your father share.

14:32.257 --> 14:34.492
Once we enter the city
and the die is cast,

14:34.560 --> 14:36.961
terrible things
will happen

14:37.029 --> 14:38.796
that is not
why I hesitate.

14:38.864 --> 14:40.064
Then?

14:41.633 --> 14:46.304
Ever since we left Rome,
I've been thinking about my father.

14:46.371 --> 14:47.972
We hadn't seen each other
in years

14:48.040 --> 14:51.576
and all he could talk about
were his games and his schemes.

14:51.643 --> 14:54.479
<i>You wonder what kind</i>
<i>of man he is?</i>

14:54.546 --> 14:57.315
If an evil man hates him...

14:57.382 --> 14:59.350
does it make your father
a good man?

14:59.418 --> 15:01.686
I don't know any more.

15:01.754 --> 15:04.722
My father and Alessandro
are brothers.

15:04.790 --> 15:08.126
Perhaps they're not
as different as I thought.

15:08.193 --> 15:10.528
Few men are like your father.

15:12.030 --> 15:14.165
These strategies
take time to unfold.

15:14.233 --> 15:17.235
But...

15:17.302 --> 15:19.504
Quon?

15:19.571 --> 15:21.038
Quon!

15:35.154 --> 15:37.188
If I thought you were going
to attack me,

15:37.256 --> 15:39.223
I would have drugged
you both.

15:39.291 --> 15:43.494
You drugged him?
Forgive me.

15:43.562 --> 15:45.263
Aslam Al-Rahim.

15:45.330 --> 15:47.298
Before you
reach Constantinople,

15:47.366 --> 15:49.534
I would like to
share something with you.

15:49.601 --> 15:52.336
You cannot think
I would trust you.

15:52.404 --> 15:54.772
And yet Leonardo does.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.440
Did he send you?

15:56.508 --> 16:01.145
I do not know Da Vinci's fate on
the other side of the world.

16:02.748 --> 16:05.683
But the Book of Leaves may have
fallen into evil hands.

16:05.751 --> 16:08.586
So if Da Vinci returns...
When he returns.

16:08.654 --> 16:11.389
..you will need to be ready.

16:11.456 --> 16:13.090
For what?

16:13.158 --> 16:15.827
As I said.

16:18.463 --> 16:22.066
Leonardo trusts me.

16:22.134 --> 16:25.236
Would you like to know why?

16:32.811 --> 16:35.813
You are dying, Leonardo.

16:35.881 --> 16:38.916
And your part of the test,
my dreamer,

16:38.984 --> 16:42.653
will not take place in this
world of the living.

16:42.721 --> 16:44.689
Then I'm not dead?

16:44.756 --> 16:46.924
Am I?

16:46.992 --> 16:49.627
You will be at sunrise.

16:49.695 --> 16:52.763
<i>Your life force is already</i>
<i>untethered.</i>

16:52.831 --> 16:56.734
<i>But that is what makes you able</i>
<i>to walk between worlds.</i>

16:59.304 --> 17:01.205
What is that?
Ayahuasca.

17:01.273 --> 17:04.508
We call it the rope
of the dead.

17:04.576 --> 17:07.744
Here.
No, no.

17:07.813 --> 17:09.547
Drink.
No.

17:09.615 --> 17:12.415
It will let you see.

17:12.483 --> 17:14.752
Perhaps the spirits
will reveal to you

17:14.819 --> 17:17.054
secrets from
the Vault of Heaven.

17:38.343 --> 17:41.078
Ssh, listen.

17:41.146 --> 17:46.784
As you walk among the dead,
you will find many temptations.

17:46.852 --> 17:51.789
But I will guide you
on your journey.

17:51.857 --> 17:53.824
How will you guide me?

17:53.892 --> 17:59.397
We have committed ourselves to
one another in the ritual.

17:59.464 --> 18:03.134
But to tie you to this world,
my dreamer,

18:03.201 --> 18:07.538
we must unite our bodies
as one.

19:16.208 --> 19:18.142
Draw from me here
the strength

19:18.210 --> 19:20.778
you will need
to survive.

19:20.846 --> 19:23.381
Give yourself to me.

19:23.448 --> 19:26.550
Give yourself to me.

19:38.797 --> 19:41.665
Give yourself to me.

19:50.675 --> 19:55.212
Your journey has begun.

19:55.280 --> 19:59.650
You will see friends
and loved ones

19:59.718 --> 20:03.554
that journeyed before you.

20:03.622 --> 20:06.424
Listen to their words.

20:06.491 --> 20:08.059
But be careful.

20:08.126 --> 20:11.562
Don't listen too long.

20:11.630 --> 20:17.134
Or your life will slip
before your eyes, dreamer.

22:23.228 --> 22:27.331
These three notes will help keep
you on your path.

22:27.399 --> 22:31.368
If you hear them, you will know
you've strayed too far.

22:41.513 --> 22:47.251
This room, Leonardo, is a
threshold between worlds.

22:47.319 --> 22:49.253
You can find your way back.

22:49.321 --> 22:53.157
Just listen to the sound
of my voice.

22:57.896 --> 22:59.496
<i>As you journey</i>
<i>through this place,</i>

22:59.564 --> 23:02.666
<i>you must follow</i>
<i>the three tones.</i>

23:02.734 --> 23:07.104
<i>Or you will be lost</i>
<i>to us forever.</i>

23:58.590 --> 24:00.824
<i>Artista?</i>

24:29.721 --> 24:31.689
Aargh!

25:46.231 --> 25:47.631
Giuliano?

25:47.699 --> 25:50.701
We meet again, artista.

25:50.769 --> 25:53.737
Am I meant to fight you?

25:53.805 --> 25:57.074
Each man is given a challenge
suited to his skills.

25:57.142 --> 26:00.210
For me, it was a battle.

26:00.278 --> 26:04.114
Yours...a riddle.

26:04.182 --> 26:07.851
<i>'A vessel I have</i>
<i>that's round like a pear</i>

26:07.919 --> 26:10.120
Moist in the middle,
surrounded with hair

26:10.188 --> 26:14.425
And often it happens,
water flowers there'

26:14.492 --> 26:18.729
Given your celebrated worship
of the female anatomy,

26:18.797 --> 26:21.398
I'm tempted to answer vulva.

26:24.169 --> 26:27.304
That would be too easy.

26:30.642 --> 26:32.910
An eye.

26:32.977 --> 26:37.948
It's moist and round,
surrounded by lashes - hair.

26:38.016 --> 26:39.516
Often glistening with tears.

26:39.584 --> 26:42.553
As were mine...

26:42.620 --> 26:44.121
when I learned of my son.

27:04.342 --> 27:06.844
Vanessa.

27:12.450 --> 27:14.618
I will protect her.

27:14.686 --> 27:16.119
See to it.

27:23.661 --> 27:27.364
My life no longer has anything
to do with Leonardo's.

27:29.968 --> 27:32.102
We are on separate journeys.

27:32.170 --> 27:35.405
Believe that if you like.

27:35.473 --> 27:38.242
But as we sit here
in the bright of day,

27:38.309 --> 27:40.944
in the New World, it is
the middle of the night.

27:41.012 --> 27:46.917
And in this night, something
disturbs the underworld.

27:46.985 --> 27:52.623
Something calls on souls
that cannot find rest.

27:52.690 --> 27:56.593
Leonardo trusts me because
I show him there are worlds

27:56.661 --> 27:59.963
larger than
the one he knows.

28:00.031 --> 28:04.768
And now I do the same
for you.

28:06.037 --> 28:09.206
Your sister has words
for you.

28:19.617 --> 28:21.051
I don't want
to see her.

28:21.119 --> 28:24.755
This is not a matter
of choice.

28:27.859 --> 28:29.993
Sister.

28:33.164 --> 28:34.865
Amelia.

28:34.933 --> 28:37.100
Amelia?

28:38.570 --> 28:39.636
I'm so sorry.

28:39.704 --> 28:42.573
Don't be.
I tried to save you.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.474
You couldn't have...

28:44.542 --> 28:45.809
I wanted it to be me.

28:45.877 --> 28:49.079
The deaths that happened,
they had to happen.

28:49.147 --> 28:53.016
The deaths that will happen,
they have to happen.

28:53.084 --> 28:54.384
What?

28:56.287 --> 28:59.923
No... No.

28:59.991 --> 29:01.458
Wait, no.

29:05.663 --> 29:06.697
Revive him.

29:06.764 --> 29:09.333
Constantinople awaits.

29:11.869 --> 29:14.938
<i>Let's talk about</i>
<i>you surviving this thing.</i>

29:15.006 --> 29:19.576
Clearly, survival wasn't
your area of expertise.

29:19.644 --> 29:24.014
No, but I excelled
in archery far beyond you.

29:24.082 --> 29:27.584
You see, if you wish
to hit your mark,

29:27.652 --> 29:30.887
whether it's galloping
horse or tyrant king,

29:30.955 --> 29:32.923
<i>you must still everything,</i>

29:32.991 --> 29:35.659
mind and body alike.

29:35.727 --> 29:40.097
That was never really
your strong suit.

29:40.164 --> 29:45.636
My entire body is screaming
different variations

29:45.703 --> 29:48.305
of 'Kill me now.'

29:48.373 --> 29:51.308
As loud as it can.

29:51.376 --> 29:53.343
Will that be of aid?

29:53.411 --> 29:56.179
To whom do you speak,
my lord?

29:59.450 --> 30:01.118
The prisoner over there.

30:01.185 --> 30:05.589
In my pain, he looks
and speaks like Giuliano.

30:07.859 --> 30:11.061
He brings me comfort.

30:11.129 --> 30:15.766
There hasn't been anyone in that
cell in all the time I've been here.

30:15.833 --> 30:19.269
<i>They think you've gone mad.</i>

30:19.337 --> 30:23.006
Perhaps you do, too.

30:23.074 --> 30:24.708
As if drawing strength
from my memory

30:24.776 --> 30:26.777
were not the sanest thing
you could do.

30:26.844 --> 30:28.945
The question is...

30:29.013 --> 30:31.314
whether you're sane enough
to accept tutelage

30:31.382 --> 30:33.917
from the one man
who can help you?

30:36.721 --> 30:40.791
You cannot rest now, brother.
You must stay awake.

30:40.858 --> 30:41.858
You must!

30:41.926 --> 30:44.294
For the first time
in your life,

30:44.362 --> 30:45.728
unless you want your
bow hand to wobble,

30:45.753 --> 30:47.667
your aim to be false
and your neck to snap

30:47.668 --> 30:51.015
like kindling, will you
at long last listen to me?

30:52.036 --> 30:55.205
Yes. Yes, I will listen.

30:55.273 --> 30:57.074
<i>You see,</i>
<i>I know you, Lorenzo.</i>

30:57.141 --> 30:59.910
Some men are
driven by love.

30:59.977 --> 31:04.581
You are at your best
when fueled by rage.

31:04.649 --> 31:06.917
All the good in you
burns brighter

31:06.984 --> 31:09.019
when you see
something you despise

31:09.087 --> 31:11.288
and that rage
drives you to act.

31:11.355 --> 31:15.058
<i>Whom do you need to see</i>
<i>in that target?</i>

31:15.126 --> 31:19.563
Whom do you hate so much
that it steadies your aim?

31:19.630 --> 31:23.700
I hate Alfonso
a fair amount just now.

31:23.768 --> 31:27.637
I've half a mind to fuck
his wife crooked once more.

31:27.705 --> 31:30.040
Alfonso's just a cruel
little daddy's boy.

31:30.108 --> 31:33.110
Every time he's inside her,
he thinks you were there first.

31:33.177 --> 31:35.145
He's far to petty to be
worth hating.

31:35.213 --> 31:37.881
Ferrante?

31:37.949 --> 31:39.549
Sixtus?

31:39.617 --> 31:43.386
No, dangerous,
deadly but remote.

31:43.454 --> 31:45.122
Think harder, brother.

31:45.189 --> 31:48.425
Who do you hate?

31:48.493 --> 31:50.894
So, old fucking Cosimo, then.

31:50.962 --> 31:54.631
With his legacy and his infernal
riddles and mysteries,

31:54.699 --> 32:00.070
that he could not entrust
to his own blood.

32:00.138 --> 32:04.207
Because of his
fucking secrets,

32:04.275 --> 32:06.543
our grand inheritance
will be our own,

32:06.611 --> 32:11.715
violent fucking deaths,

32:11.783 --> 32:17.187
at the hands of these
goddamn philistines!

32:17.255 --> 32:19.856
Long dead!

32:19.924 --> 32:23.727
<i>Long dead! Find your best</i>
<i>target, Lorenzo.</i>

32:23.795 --> 32:25.295
Quiet down!

32:25.363 --> 32:29.866
I'm to be made an example of?

32:29.934 --> 32:33.970
The great Ferrante wishes
to embarrass me, to humble me.

32:34.038 --> 32:37.073
To humble you more,
brother.

32:37.141 --> 32:39.342
No, I really didn't imagine it
would be this difficult

32:39.410 --> 32:40.777
for you to answer.

32:40.845 --> 32:45.949
Who...do...you...hate?

32:57.929 --> 33:00.697
Aargh! Argh!

33:17.715 --> 33:19.583
Aargh!

34:07.899 --> 34:11.268
I know the hand
of this painter.

34:11.335 --> 34:14.804
Painted some time around 1502,
it is said.

34:14.871 --> 34:16.306
La Giaconda.

34:16.373 --> 34:18.541
The Mona Lisa.

34:18.609 --> 34:21.911
Not your best work,
in my opinion.

34:21.978 --> 34:24.714
Who is this woman?

34:24.782 --> 34:26.716
For centuries,
the Mona Lisa's identity

34:26.784 --> 34:28.885
will be shrouded
in mystery.

34:28.953 --> 34:32.088
One of many mysteries
surrounding your life,

34:32.156 --> 34:35.425
but I believe the Turk already
told you of that?

34:35.493 --> 34:38.762
How your history
would be suppressed.

34:39.730 --> 34:41.898
What I don't know...

34:41.966 --> 34:45.302
One of the many things
that I don't know...

34:45.369 --> 34:47.337
..is why.

34:47.405 --> 34:50.005
How quickly would you unfold
the answers of a lifetime?

34:51.375 --> 34:52.943
Is this my mother?

34:53.010 --> 34:54.978
Of course you would
think that.

34:55.045 --> 34:57.045
I might argue every woman
you paint is your mother.

34:57.047 --> 34:58.615
Fuck you!

34:58.683 --> 35:00.183
The retort of a genius?

35:02.586 --> 35:07.390
Well, why do I complete
this painting, then?

35:07.458 --> 35:10.060
Of all the paintings
I start then stop,

35:10.127 --> 35:13.396
you've shown me
I can finish it.

35:13.464 --> 35:15.432
Why do I have to?

35:15.499 --> 35:17.534
Ask her.

35:24.709 --> 35:27.644
She knows!

35:27.712 --> 35:30.580
Doesn't she?

35:30.648 --> 35:33.450
<i>The landscape</i>
<i>behind this woman?</i>

35:33.517 --> 35:35.452
<i>It's mysterious.</i>

35:35.519 --> 35:38.121
<i>Desolate.</i>

35:38.189 --> 35:41.925
<i>A sort of...riddle, no?</i>

35:41.993 --> 35:44.461
Always another puzzle.

35:44.528 --> 35:47.130
<i>Well, it works, does it not?</i>

35:49.400 --> 35:51.034
What's this?

35:51.102 --> 35:53.436
<i>'Leonard di ser Piero</i>
<i>Da Vinci.</i>

35:53.504 --> 35:55.472
<i>Born in Vinci, 1452,</i>

35:55.539 --> 35:58.541
died in Nanterre, 1525.'

35:58.609 --> 36:00.143
Nanterre?

36:00.211 --> 36:02.245
France is where I'll die?

36:02.313 --> 36:05.281
History is a canvas,
constantly repainted.

36:05.349 --> 36:07.317
You might die today.

36:07.385 --> 36:09.919
Perhaps you are dying
as we speak.

36:11.789 --> 36:15.258
No, no, wait!
Wait, I need more time!

36:15.326 --> 36:18.161
You were warned
not to stay too long.

36:18.229 --> 36:20.196
My life is about
tempting fate.

36:20.264 --> 36:24.968
What if I told you the road
ahead would be even more perilous?

36:25.036 --> 36:26.436
More painful?

36:26.504 --> 36:29.572
I would not stray from it.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.041
I hope that is so.

36:33.044 --> 36:36.446
<i>The longer you remain here,</i>
<i>the greater the price you will pay.</i>

37:09.980 --> 37:11.548
You're here?

37:15.486 --> 37:17.687
At last.

37:20.291 --> 37:22.892
I thought I would not live
to see this moment.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.928
Who are you?

37:24.995 --> 37:27.263
Who am I?

37:34.071 --> 37:39.375
I recall being more observant
when I was your age.

37:43.614 --> 37:44.747
You're me!

37:56.093 --> 37:58.628
I am the wrath of God!

38:17.948 --> 38:19.782
Aaargh!

38:46.744 --> 38:49.946
Fuck, fuck! Die!

38:58.622 --> 38:59.703
I live to be your age,
then?

38:59.757 --> 39:02.725
That all depends.

39:02.793 --> 39:06.462
Just because you see me now,

39:06.530 --> 39:10.333
it doesn't mean you will
live to see tomorrow.

39:10.401 --> 39:11.901
How is this possible?

39:11.969 --> 39:14.637
You should have learnt
by now.

39:14.705 --> 39:18.474
Anything is possible.

39:18.542 --> 39:23.980
<i>Did we not experience</i>
<i>something similar in our youth?</i>

39:26.150 --> 39:28.184
Free me!

39:31.488 --> 39:34.724
Well, if you're me...

39:34.792 --> 39:39.762
..then you know what happens
in the years that bridge us.

39:39.830 --> 39:42.932
And if I tell
you anything...

39:43.000 --> 39:44.834
..it may change
every outcome.

39:44.902 --> 39:46.936
You already have just
by being here.

39:47.004 --> 39:49.539
I forgot just how petulant
I could be.

39:49.607 --> 39:53.643
Apparently, that's the one thing that
doesn't fade with age.

39:53.711 --> 39:56.379
We have not the time.

39:59.250 --> 40:03.119
What is the most
important question

40:03.187 --> 40:06.656
that you
could ask me?

40:11.862 --> 40:15.665
Do I find the Book of Leaves?

40:15.733 --> 40:17.967
Do you find it?

40:20.671 --> 40:25.775
You must protect it.

40:26.510 --> 40:30.113
And it will cost you...

40:30.180 --> 40:32.815
..everything

40:32.883 --> 40:37.120
that you hold dear.

40:37.187 --> 40:40.590
But you must not let it
fall into their hands.

40:40.658 --> 40:42.458
Whose hands?
You don't know...

40:42.526 --> 40:44.894
You don't know yet.

40:44.962 --> 40:48.431
The enemies of Man.

40:48.499 --> 40:50.833
If it falls into the hands
of the Labyrinth,

40:50.901 --> 40:53.603
it will bring about
a permanent darkness.

40:53.671 --> 40:55.938
<i>Stay on the path,</i>
<i>my dreamer.</i>

40:56.006 --> 40:58.474
Time is a river and yours
is about to run dry.

40:58.542 --> 41:02.111
You must go.
But please, promise me...

41:02.179 --> 41:05.448
Promise me that you will...

41:05.516 --> 41:08.451
you will not end up
like this.

41:08.519 --> 41:09.652
No.

41:09.720 --> 41:10.953
Promise me.

41:11.021 --> 41:12.588
How? Why?

41:12.656 --> 41:15.158
Why are you...

41:15.225 --> 41:17.427
Why are we in chains?

41:17.494 --> 41:20.129
Because I failed.
How?

41:20.197 --> 41:24.067
There's no time.
And you must go.

41:24.134 --> 41:25.635
You must go!

41:25.703 --> 41:27.670
Your journey cannot
have been in vain.

41:27.738 --> 41:29.772
<i>You have stayed</i>
<i>too long, Leonardo.</i>

41:29.840 --> 41:32.408
Go!

41:32.476 --> 41:35.311
<i> Come back!</i>

41:35.379 --> 41:36.646
Go!

41:40.718 --> 41:43.519
The Lord
is a man of war.

41:43.587 --> 41:46.055
The Lord
is his name.

41:46.123 --> 41:50.560
<i>Those who would join me at</i>
<i>my table be similarly worthy.</i>

41:50.627 --> 41:53.930
Warriors baptized in blood.

41:53.997 --> 41:56.799
In his name. Amen.

41:56.867 --> 41:58.401
Amen.
Amen.

41:58.469 --> 42:01.971
<i>The Game of Thrace</i>
<i>is simple.</i>

42:02.039 --> 42:05.608
<i>And it removes from my presence</i>
<i>those who are not worthy</i>

42:05.676 --> 42:07.143
<i>of bargaining with me.</i>

42:07.211 --> 42:09.379
It's fiendish, Lorenzo.

42:09.446 --> 42:11.414
Unless your aim is perfect,

42:11.482 --> 42:14.417
your strength great enough
to kill the poor beast

42:14.485 --> 42:16.085
with a single shot.

42:16.153 --> 42:18.221
Then, snap.

42:53.023 --> 42:56.359
Long live Florence!
Pull the lever!

43:27.458 --> 43:29.392
Constantinople.

43:29.460 --> 43:32.995
Its new ruler is pleased
to rename it Istanbul,

43:33.063 --> 43:35.965
a city the likes of which
has never been seen before.

43:36.033 --> 43:38.935
Nor shall ever be seen again.

43:43.173 --> 43:45.875
Your sister
spoke of death.

43:48.946 --> 43:52.515
That wasn't my sister.

43:52.583 --> 43:54.050
You know whom you saw.

43:54.117 --> 43:59.021
The memory
will serve you.

43:59.089 --> 44:02.425
Someday there will be a man
who would  serve the Labyrinth,

44:02.493 --> 44:05.828
who would use the
Book of Leaves for death.

44:05.896 --> 44:09.599
You must make him listen
to you, Signora Donati.

44:09.666 --> 44:13.369
You alone can
make him listen.

44:13.437 --> 44:16.672
What is this Labyrinth?

44:16.740 --> 44:19.775
Who is the man
that you speak of?

44:19.843 --> 44:23.679
When you must know,
you will know.

44:27.084 --> 44:28.518
I wish you luck
on your quest.

44:28.585 --> 44:31.320
I pray you survive it.

44:31.388 --> 44:34.724
And in preparing you
for what will come,

44:34.791 --> 44:37.593
whether you accept it or not,

44:37.661 --> 44:39.996
I have done you
a kindness today.

44:40.063 --> 44:43.032
And now you owe me.

44:47.004 --> 44:48.771
Get up!

44:54.945 --> 44:56.345
King Ferrante!

44:56.413 --> 44:59.615
As you are like the Lord, full
of mercy and wisdom,

44:59.683 --> 45:02.652
I plead mercy
for my companion Piero.

45:02.719 --> 45:04.687
He is here because I am here.

45:04.755 --> 45:07.690
He must not be made
to face this test.

45:07.758 --> 45:11.561
For it is I who seek
an audience and not him.

45:11.628 --> 45:15.431
If you are the man of character
your people say you are,

45:15.499 --> 45:18.634
spare him.

45:21.038 --> 45:22.772
We understand.

45:22.839 --> 45:26.509
And we grant you this boon.

45:26.577 --> 45:29.445
If Lorenzo fail
in his task,

45:29.513 --> 45:31.898
executioner, run your sword
through his companion,

45:31.899 --> 45:32.319
No!

45:32.344 --> 45:34.344
so that his death may
be swift and merciful.

45:36.553 --> 45:38.521
It is how God
would want it.

45:38.589 --> 45:40.556
You can do this,
Lorenzo.

45:40.624 --> 45:42.592
<i>Master your rage</i>
<i>and harness it.</i>

45:42.659 --> 45:45.461
Name it and you will own it.
Clarice.

45:45.529 --> 45:48.831
You resent her for not being
every woman in the world

45:48.899 --> 45:49.966
but you're still
proud of her.

45:50.033 --> 45:51.968
Dig deeper, brother.
Da Vinci.

45:52.035 --> 45:54.003
Come on!
He may infuriate.

45:54.071 --> 45:57.506
But he fights for the same world
as you with the same weapons.

45:57.574 --> 46:02.545
The traitor Lucrezia.
Finally someone worth hating!

46:02.613 --> 46:04.580
But most likely
dead already.

46:04.648 --> 46:08.250
So are you. It doesn't seem
to stand in your way.

46:08.318 --> 46:11.887
And there it is.

46:11.955 --> 46:13.756
No.
Yes.

46:13.824 --> 46:18.027
Yes. Is it really
so surprising?

46:18.095 --> 46:20.062
Why, brother?
Why me?

46:20.130 --> 46:22.098
For one thing,

46:22.165 --> 46:24.800
you could have passed
this test in an instant.

46:24.868 --> 46:26.836
<i>This test and any other.</i>

46:26.903 --> 46:30.439
<i>Everything was so easy</i>
<i>for me, my life was so easy.</i>

46:30.507 --> 46:33.042
It wasn't true.
It wasn't true.

46:33.110 --> 46:35.611
It's what I thought once,
perhaps.

46:35.679 --> 46:38.581
But you fought for Florence
harder than any of us.

46:38.649 --> 46:41.817
Yes, I fought.
I fought.

46:41.885 --> 46:44.887
And died.

46:44.955 --> 46:50.760
And that...
that is why you hate me.

46:50.827 --> 46:52.828
<i>No one ever</i>
<i>wants to say it.</i>

46:52.896 --> 46:56.065
<i>A part of us always hates</i>
<i>the dead for leaving us.</i>

46:56.133 --> 46:57.667
God damn you for dying!

47:00.404 --> 47:01.437
<i>Name your hate now.</i>

47:01.505 --> 47:03.773
<i>Master it.</i>

47:03.840 --> 47:06.742
<i>And loose your fucking bow.</i>

47:09.413 --> 47:13.282
God damn you
for dying before me"

47:25.962 --> 47:29.665
No! No!

47:34.071 --> 47:35.871
So, Ferrante.

47:35.939 --> 47:37.807
No more games!

48:20.617 --> 48:23.986
Be swift, my lord.

48:24.054 --> 48:27.156
The sun is on its way.

48:38.034 --> 48:41.637
Do they expect me
to kill you?

48:41.705 --> 48:44.306
You must...

48:44.374 --> 48:47.977
before you claim
this antidote.

48:48.044 --> 48:51.714
<i>Stay on the path,</i>
<i>my dreamer.</i>

48:51.782 --> 48:56.152
<i>Follow the tones and I will</i>
<i>lead you back to me.</i>

48:56.219 --> 49:00.022
<i>Do not be tempted by the</i>
<i>knowledge you may find.</i>

49:06.963 --> 49:10.166
<i>The threshold, Leonardo.</i>

49:10.233 --> 49:11.534
<i>You must hurry back!</i>

49:13.870 --> 49:15.471
How many years
have you lost

49:15.539 --> 49:18.040
that you would have had
otherwise, artista?

49:18.108 --> 49:18.763
Giuliano!

49:18.788 --> 49:21.355
Can you make the rest of your
life count?

49:21.545 --> 49:24.747
Would you have me protect
Vanessa or not?

49:26.316 --> 49:28.050
I implore you.

49:28.118 --> 49:31.987
Strike quickly
and with all mercy.

49:32.055 --> 49:34.857
What's at stake here

49:34.925 --> 49:38.093
is greater than one life,
Girolamo.

49:38.161 --> 49:40.663
You have told me
again and again.

49:40.730 --> 49:43.833
Da Vinci must live.

49:43.900 --> 49:46.602
Without him, you cannot
enter the Vault of Heaven.

49:49.272 --> 49:51.941
No, no.
You must.

49:53.944 --> 49:56.111
You must.

49:59.115 --> 50:00.282
<i>Hurry, my dreamer!</i>

50:12.729 --> 50:14.063
<i>Leonardo!</i>

50:21.705 --> 50:23.939
You must.

50:45.562 --> 50:48.664
Do you remember the story
of Solomon and Sheba?

50:48.732 --> 50:50.599
Of course.

50:58.575 --> 51:02.077
I had such plans.

51:09.252 --> 51:10.686
Zita?

51:29.039 --> 51:32.374
Tell him I forgive him.

51:32.442 --> 51:35.911
<i>Run to me,</i>
<i>Leonardo. Run!</i>

51:45.488 --> 51:47.489
Come back to me, Leonardo!

51:47.557 --> 51:49.925
Come back, my dreamer,
you have stayed too long!

51:49.993 --> 51:53.162
Come back!

51:58.201 --> 52:01.403
You have returned.

52:01.471 --> 52:05.908
Look, your friend
has succeeded.

52:05.976 --> 52:07.676
I am not his friend.

52:28.431 --> 52:30.933
You have passed the test,
my dreamer.

52:39.809 --> 52:41.176
Thank you.

52:43.646 --> 52:46.815
Tomorrow,
the Sun and the Moon

52:46.883 --> 52:48.550
will enter
the Vault of Heaven.

52:48.618 --> 52:50.019
As will I.

53:14.344 --> 53:18.113
I killed Zita
to save you.

53:18.181 --> 53:19.214
I know.

53:23.953 --> 53:26.188
She forgives you.

53:38.701 --> 53:41.537
Know this, Da Vinci.

53:41.604 --> 53:46.208
If we depart this place
without the Book of Leaves,

53:46.276 --> 53:49.144
I will kill you myself.
