00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:07.670 --> 00:10.500
What the heck is that?

00:10.500 --> 00:12.880
- Could be a camera.
- Or a thermometer.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.380
I bet it's a dolphin
translator.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.830
And it could not
come sooner.

00:15.830 --> 00:17.620
I can't wait to hear
what they have to say.

00:17.620 --> 00:19.120
It's a heart rate monitor.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.420
It's the first part
of my lie detector test.

00:21.420 --> 00:23.120
Your heart rate goes up
when you lie.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.500
Or when your work
gets interrupted.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.540
Uh, what do you need
a lie detector for?

00:27.540 --> 00:29.460
Abuela sent us
Valentine candy.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.500
Everybody says
they didn't see it,

00:31.500 --> 00:33.500
yet I found the empty box
in the trash.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.330
-Well, it wasn't me.
-We'll see.

00:36.330 --> 00:38.710
Oh, which wire are you gonna
connect next, red or blue?

00:38.710 --> 00:41.670
I thought you guys were
going to the movies tonight.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.500
Well, we couldn't
decide which one,

00:43.500 --> 00:44.880
so we figured we'd see
what you were doing.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.420
This happens every time
Georgie and Wyatt hang out.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.460
You know how sometimes
people feel like

00:51.460 --> 00:53.500
they're the third wheel
in a relationship?

00:53.500 --> 00:56.710
That's me. And I never
even wanted to be
a part of the tricycle.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.330
I'm working.

00:59.330 --> 01:00.670
At least I'm trying to.

01:00.670 --> 01:02.250
Well, I'd better get home.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.830
But still really curious
about that red

01:03.830 --> 01:05.540
-Red
-Knew it.

01:05.540 --> 01:08.620
-Okay, bye.
-Oh-- Bye.

01:08.620 --> 01:11.040
Have you noticed
every time you and Wyatt
hang out,

01:11.040 --> 01:12.420
you actually hang in?

01:12.420 --> 01:14.790
-With me.

01:14.790 --> 01:18.120
-Wait, why is the queen
running through the forest?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.540
Because the fire elves
are chasing her.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.380
-We don't know yet.

01:21.380 --> 01:23.040
They just crawled
out of the dungeon.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.250
Oh. Missed that.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.750
-I'll rewind.
-Okay.

01:30.380 --> 01:32.380
What do you want to eat?

01:32.380 --> 01:34.500
I don't know.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.170
Huh. Me neither.

01:37.210 --> 01:38.460
Hey, Harley,

01:38.460 --> 01:39.710
what are you having?

01:39.710 --> 01:41.080
Peanut butter
and jelly.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.750
That sounds good.
-Mmm.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.580
Wow.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.960
Our relationship
has really slipped
since the prom.

01:51.960 --> 01:54.790
And he spent half of that
talking to a potted fern
he thought was me.

01:54.790 --> 01:57.540
Okay, "Grandpa thought
I was a potted plant"

01:57.540 --> 02:00.040
is not the kind of story
you want to be telling
your grandkids.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.250
You two need to get out
and make better memories.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.420
It's weird. We have fun
at my games and at parties,

02:05.420 --> 02:07.290
but when it's up to us
to make a plan,

02:07.290 --> 02:10.380
we end up eating
your sandwich.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.170
I like Wyatt, but maybe
the two of us just don't work.

02:13.170 --> 02:14.830
Well, I know
the three of us don't.

02:14.830 --> 02:18.000
Starting now, you are
going to be coming up
with your own activities.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.170
You're right.
One of us needs
to take charge.

02:20.170 --> 02:22.790
But how will we decide
which one?

02:22.790 --> 02:24.880
You, Georgie! It should be you!

02:24.880 --> 02:27.880
Yes. Me, of course.
I will take charge.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.420
-With your help.
-I would be happy to.

02:30.420 --> 02:31.830
For your sake.

02:31.830 --> 02:33.460
And because I need
to finish this

02:33.460 --> 02:35.580
before the Valentine thief
strikes at Easter.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.080
You can steal my candy hearts,

02:37.080 --> 02:39.040
but no one takes
my chocolate bunny.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.750
The new take-charge,
decisive Georgie
just texted Wyatt.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.380
I'm making us a plan
for Saturday.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.880
So what should we do?

03:39.880 --> 03:43.670
Well, where would you go
if you were taking yourself out?

03:43.670 --> 03:44.620
Start with a meal.

03:44.620 --> 03:47.290
Hmm. Okay, well,

03:47.290 --> 03:49.670
I would take me
to the grilled cheese truck.

03:49.670 --> 03:50.960
See how easy that was?

03:50.960 --> 03:52.500
Keep going.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.460
Then I would eat it
in Dobson Park.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.080
You know the bench
next to the garden?

03:57.080 --> 04:00.120
Love it. That sounds so good
I want to tag along.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.540
But I won't, because,
as you know now,

04:02.540 --> 04:04.620
and should have before,
that's weird.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.790
-Hmm.
-Okay.

04:05.790 --> 04:07.750
Grilled cheese, park--
then what?

04:07.750 --> 04:10.790
Oh! And if I'm in the park,
I would love for me
to take me roller skating!

04:10.790 --> 04:13.540
See? You're showing yourself
a great time.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.460
I am, but this date's
for Wyatt, too.

04:16.460 --> 04:18.540
Isn't it selfish
if I only plan stuff
that I like?

04:18.540 --> 04:21.120
Well, you and Wyatt
like most of the same things.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.960
That's why you're such
a great couple.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.790
If you plan things
that you like to do,
he'll like them too.

04:25.790 --> 04:28.750
You're right.
I can't wait to have
the perfect date with me!

04:28.750 --> 04:30.380
I mean, Wyatt.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.330
And I can't wait
for the perfect date with me--

04:34.330 --> 04:35.920
finishing my heart rate
monitor.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.170
I'm so excited.
I wish it was already finished

04:38.170 --> 04:40.420
so I could measure
how excited I am.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.670
Hey. Saw you reading comics
at school the other day.

04:46.670 --> 04:48.580
Ever heard of Doctor Tick

04:48.580 --> 04:49.920
Of course.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.790
I just got the latest issue.

04:51.790 --> 04:54.210
Thought you might
want to check it out.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.710
I'll just give it
a quick glance

04:58.710 --> 05:01.000
and then slide it back
under the gate to you.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.710
Okay, bye.

05:04.290 --> 05:05.830
Wait.

05:05.830 --> 05:08.670
This issue isn't even out yet.

05:08.670 --> 05:10.210
How do you have it already?

05:10.210 --> 05:12.290
My friend Todd
from my old school,

05:12.290 --> 05:13.830
his dad draws it.

05:13.830 --> 05:15.830
You know Garth Benson?

05:15.830 --> 05:17.790
-Uh-huh.

05:17.790 --> 05:19.420
A lot like Doctor Tick-Tock,

05:19.420 --> 05:20.830
minus the solar-powered
clock helmet.

05:20.830 --> 05:22.880
I had that helmet
when I was a kid!

05:22.880 --> 05:24.210
Me too!

05:24.210 --> 05:25.670
That thing made no sense.

05:25.670 --> 05:27.750
What's the point
of having a clock
on your head?

05:27.750 --> 05:29.040
You can't even see it!

05:29.040 --> 05:30.620
And it never worked!

05:30.620 --> 05:33.170
I was late to school,
every day.

05:34.670 --> 05:37.830
They're in town.
I'm supposed to have dinner
with them tonight.

05:37.830 --> 05:39.170
You're welcome to come.

05:39.170 --> 05:41.080
To dinner?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.830
W

05:42.830 --> 05:45.250
-Uh-huh.
-Oh ho!

05:45.250 --> 05:46.620
Wait.

05:46.620 --> 05:49.000
No, I-I can't.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.830
You're not exactly
my sister's favorite person.

05:51.830 --> 05:54.710
I mean, between
the backyard battle

05:54.710 --> 05:57.210
and the fight you had
over the announcements...

05:57.210 --> 05:59.120
Oh, and do you still
do that drumming thing
with your fingers?

05:59.120 --> 06:00.460
'Cause she hates that.

06:00.460 --> 06:03.920
That's why I'm inviting you--
no her.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.250
Still.

06:05.250 --> 06:08.170
Wait. You're not
afraid of your sister, are you?

06:08.170 --> 06:11.170
Afraid? No.

06:11.170 --> 06:15.080
Pfft! She's, like...small.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.830
So that's yes.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.750
Yes.
That's a yes.

06:22.540 --> 06:24.330
See ya.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.830
Thanks to me having
some alone time,

06:37.830 --> 06:39.830
this baby's finally finished.

06:43.710 --> 06:47.380
Heart rate steady.
I did not take Abuela's candy.

06:47.380 --> 06:50.170
Hey! New take-charge Georgie
is back.

06:50.170 --> 06:51.580
How'd it go with Wyatt?

06:51.580 --> 06:52.880
Wait.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.750
Your heart is racing.

06:55.750 --> 06:56.960
It must have been exciting.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.290
Or you took the candy.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.330
-I didn't.
-We'll see.

07:00.330 --> 07:02.580
Now sit. I want
to hear everything.

07:02.580 --> 07:04.250
Start at the beginning.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.710
Okay. Well, first,
we hit the grilled cheese truck.

07:06.710 --> 07:09.290
Mmm! Warm, gooey goodness.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.790
Solid start to an awesome time.

07:11.790 --> 07:15.380
Oh! This is so delicious!

07:15.380 --> 07:17.330
Thanks for takin' charge
of today.

07:17.330 --> 07:20.830
Don't thank me.
We owe it all to Harley.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.250
-Boop!
-Oh! Boop!

07:25.250 --> 07:27.790
I was just the inspiration.

07:27.790 --> 07:29.920
-You get the credit.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.960
-More like blame.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.420
Georgie: Last month
Wyatt got food poisoning
from a grilled cheese.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.620
Now even the smell of it
makes him sick.

07:36.620 --> 07:38.170
He didn't want to say anything
because I told him

07:38.170 --> 07:39.960
grilled cheese was
my favorite thing.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.540
Oh!

07:44.920 --> 07:46.380
Oh! Done already?

07:46.380 --> 07:48.000
I'll order you another.

07:51.790 --> 07:55.960
Okay, food fail,
but at least you were
eating at the park.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.670
The setting was beautiful.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.830
What a great spot.

08:01.830 --> 08:03.460
You really nailed it.

08:03.460 --> 08:05.790
No. Harley nailed it.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.880
I'm just a person.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.880
Anybody could save
a relationship.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.920
Slow down, anybody.
That is not how it went.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.880
Georgie: Turns out they had
fertilized the garden--

08:17.880 --> 08:19.460
with chicken manure.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.290
Oh, no,
could you smell it?

08:21.290 --> 08:23.830
Smell and,
when a big wind
kicked up, taste.

08:23.830 --> 08:25.830
FYI, chicken manure
does not taste like chicken.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.380
-Not fast enough.

08:30.830 --> 08:33.790
So...roller skating
turned it all around?

08:35.620 --> 08:37.580
Ahh. This is fun.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.420
And thanks to all this
protective gear,

08:39.420 --> 08:40.620
we can't even get hurt.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.880
Hurt? We're past
that nonsense.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.620
Only good things
can happen now.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.710
After
the fertilizer storm,
Wyatt couldn't really see.

08:53.710 --> 08:56.290
He didn't learn
his lesson after prom
and have backup contacts?

08:56.290 --> 08:59.000
-Oh, yeah. They're fine.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.460
-Okay.
-Go ahead.

09:00.460 --> 09:02.880
He not only learned,
he got laser eye surgery.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.330
Which is too bad,
because his giant glasses

09:05.330 --> 09:07.080
could have kept
the tornado of chicken poop
out of eyes.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.920
Ohh!

09:08.920 --> 09:11.380
Which led to my first
good decision of the day:

09:11.380 --> 09:12.790
taking him to the hospital.

09:12.790 --> 09:14.120
-When he fell

09:14.120 --> 09:16.500
he broke his arm--
and his other wrist.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.330
If this isn't a sign
we're not meant to be together,

09:18.330 --> 09:20.710
I don't know what
I'm waiting for--
a meteor to hit him?

09:20.710 --> 09:24.920
I'm sorry. I don't even
know what to say.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.170
Except that there won't be
another meteor shower
for five months.

09:27.170 --> 09:29.080
Ohh. I can't wait that long.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.710
In every couple, there should be
a leader and a follower.

09:31.710 --> 09:34.580
When two followers
get together,
this is what happens.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.000
Wyatt and I
need to break up.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.960
Okay.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.880
Wow. Uh...

09:43.880 --> 09:45.670
well, you're being a leader now.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.670
You just made
a really big decision.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.080
Actually, two decisions.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.790
I also decided
you're telling him.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.290
Me?! Why should I
be the one

09:57.290 --> 09:58.540
to break up with Wyatt?!

09:58.540 --> 09:59.710
This whole thing is your fault.

09:59.710 --> 10:00.920
You made me plan
my perfect day

10:00.920 --> 10:02.290
and ruin Wyatt's life.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.210
Look, I gave you advice,
you took it,

10:04.210 --> 10:05.460
and it turned out terribly.

10:05.460 --> 10:06.670
It happens every day
in this house.

10:06.670 --> 10:08.120
Well, I can't
break up with him.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.120
You've seen what happens
when I make decisions.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.880
Wyatt's already lost
both of his arms--

10:11.880 --> 10:13.120
he can't afford to lose
his legs, too.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.580
He walks to school.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.120
I don't know how to
break up with someone!

10:16.120 --> 10:17.880
I took a nine-year-old
to the prom

10:17.880 --> 10:19.330
because I couldn't
hurt his feelings.

10:19.330 --> 10:21.380
There's a photo in the yearbook
of me and the top of his head.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.080
You know what?

10:23.080 --> 10:25.380
This is my problem,
not yours.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.290
-I'll handle it.
-Good.

10:27.290 --> 10:29.250
Now what are you
gonna say?

10:29.250 --> 10:31.960
Nothing. Wyatt and I
will just stay together.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.500
Get married someday,

10:33.500 --> 10:34.880
move upstate,

10:34.880 --> 10:36.080
maybe downstate.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.670
Maybe some other state.

10:37.670 --> 10:38.830
Or we could stay here.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.120
Can we do Thanksgiving
with your family?

10:40.120 --> 10:43.210
No. I will break up with him.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.250
Hey.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.420
Why are you here?

10:46.420 --> 10:48.120
"Thanks for the awesome dinner
last night

10:48.120 --> 10:49.710
"with my favorite
comic book artist

10:49.710 --> 10:52.000
I never would have met
on my own, Aiden."

10:52.000 --> 10:53.080
Is that what you meant?

10:53.080 --> 10:55.330
Sorry. You just
surprised me.

10:55.330 --> 10:57.960
You're right. Thanks.

10:57.960 --> 11:00.120
So, uh, what's up?

11:00.120 --> 11:01.670
Just wanted to borrow that book
you were talking about.

11:01.670 --> 11:04.750
Ya know, I can't
go get it right now.

11:04.750 --> 11:05.960
I'll bring it
to school tomorrow.

11:07.920 --> 11:10.120
You didn't tell Harley
we're hanging out, did you?

11:10.120 --> 11:13.040
Uh, haven't really seen her.
Heh. Big family.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.500
People get lost
in the crowd.

11:14.500 --> 11:18.080
Didn't even know we had Daphne
till she was, like, three.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.420
I'm going to track down Harley
and tell her.

11:20.420 --> 11:22.120
As soon as I'm finished
with this.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.960
Okay.

11:23.960 --> 11:27.040
Hey, good luck standing up
to your little sister.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.040
Ohh.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.250
Aah!

11:35.250 --> 11:38.210
You put that guy
on the Dead To Diaz list

11:38.210 --> 11:40.000
for being a jerk to Harley.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.210
Why are you back there?
What are you doing?

11:42.210 --> 11:44.380
What are you doing?

11:44.380 --> 11:46.290
You're not supposed
to speak to him--

11:46.290 --> 11:48.120
even if it's lies.

11:48.120 --> 11:50.210
Especially if it's lies.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.500
Your lies are terrible.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.920
Really? I thought
they were pretty--

11:53.920 --> 11:55.040
Terrible.

11:55.040 --> 11:57.920
You're hanging out with a dude
who's Dead To Diaz.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.580
Even I wouldn't do that.

11:59.580 --> 12:02.580
And I just spied on you
through garbage.

12:02.580 --> 12:05.460
I'm going to need ten dollars
to keep this quiet.

12:05.460 --> 12:08.380
Forget it.
I'm telling Harley myself.

12:08.380 --> 12:10.960
Fine. I'll take five!

12:10.960 --> 12:15.040
Uhh. Nothing kills a bribe game
like honesty.

12:17.790 --> 12:21.120
I'm kind of worried
about how Wyatt's
going to handle the bad news,

12:21.120 --> 12:24.670
but I figure
everything is easier to take
with some warm cookies.

12:24.670 --> 12:27.210
Plus, who can cry
when their mouth's filled
with chocolate chips?

12:27.210 --> 12:29.500
Ohh. Got a sec?

12:29.500 --> 12:34.000
Sure. Just baking some cookies
for Georgie's soon-to-be
ex-boyfriend.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.620
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

12:36.620 --> 12:39.670
So, I...

12:39.670 --> 12:41.380
What are you doing?

12:41.380 --> 12:42.790
Heart rate monitor.

12:42.790 --> 12:44.170
I think it's messed up.

12:44.170 --> 12:47.040
I have something to do later
that I'm really nervous about,

12:47.040 --> 12:49.290
and it's saying my heart rate
is only normal.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.880
I'm gonna test the levels out
on you while you talk.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.290
-Great idea.

12:55.290 --> 12:58.830
Okay...
how do I put this?

12:58.830 --> 13:03.080
You know that video
where the man becomes friends
with the goose?

13:03.080 --> 13:04.540
I haven't seen it.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.670
So, this guy is going
for a walk one day,

13:07.670 --> 13:09.500
and this goose
climbs out of a lake

13:09.500 --> 13:11.000
and starts following him around.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.330
-It sounds crazy,

13:12.330 --> 13:13.750
but before you know it,

13:13.750 --> 13:15.540
they end up becoming buds.

13:15.540 --> 13:18.960
The man never thought it would
happen in a million years,

13:18.960 --> 13:20.540
and I'm sure the goose
didn't either,

13:20.540 --> 13:23.040
and even though a man
and a goose becoming friends
makes no sense,

13:23.040 --> 13:26.120
it totally works
because they're both fans
of the same comic book.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.710
Wait, the goose can read?
You should have led with that.

13:28.710 --> 13:32.670
The thing to remember is,
neither the man or the goose
meant to hurt anyone's feelings.

13:32.670 --> 13:35.120
-I guess what I'm trying
to say is--

13:35.120 --> 13:37.920
Whoa. This thing says
your heart rate
is off the charts.

13:39.290 --> 13:41.210
Did you take the abuela candy?

13:41.210 --> 13:44.460
No! It's because I--

13:44.460 --> 13:46.500
friends--

13:46.500 --> 13:48.580
the goose can read, Harley!

13:48.580 --> 13:49.580
-Ohh!

13:53.170 --> 13:56.120
Ohh. I don't want to do this.

14:03.380 --> 14:06.580
Huh. Everything is easier
with cookies.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.290
Harley!

14:14.290 --> 14:16.880
Oh. I think I know
why you're here.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.250
Good. That'll make this go
a lot faster.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.250
I always knew the Diazes
were great people,

14:22.250 --> 14:24.620
but I can't believe you
remembered today's my birthday!

14:26.710 --> 14:28.290
I can't either!

14:28.290 --> 14:30.210
I just can't believe it!

14:30.210 --> 14:32.000
Really can't believe it.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.580
Your birthday!
Of course!

14:38.580 --> 14:41.620
Which is why I brought you
these chocolate chip cookies.

14:41.620 --> 14:42.920
Happy birthday.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.960
Or should I say,
"Chippy birthday"?

14:44.960 --> 14:46.580
Here you go.

14:46.580 --> 14:48.750
Could you carry them in
for me?

14:48.750 --> 14:51.380
Your timing's great.
You can stay and watch me
open presents.

14:51.380 --> 14:53.040
Of course.

14:54.210 --> 14:56.120
Ohh.

15:01.290 --> 15:03.670
Hey! Thanks for comin' down.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.040
I got that comic book
you wanted to borrow.

15:06.040 --> 15:10.210
In fact, I brought
my entire collection.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.210
What better place
to get your geek on
than a bait shop?

15:13.210 --> 15:15.420
Lots of space to lounge,

15:15.420 --> 15:17.380
refreshing salty air,

15:17.380 --> 15:19.380
the chatter
of old fishermen.

15:19.380 --> 15:20.920
Dude, just admit it.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.500
You're afraid to tell
your sister we're friends.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.250
I'm not afraid
of my sister.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.420
Good, 'cause
there she is now.

15:26.420 --> 15:29.040
Duck!

15:29.040 --> 15:30.710
I was joking.

15:30.710 --> 15:33.250
Heh. Me too.

15:33.250 --> 15:35.330
You still didn't
tell her yet, did you?

15:35.330 --> 15:36.880
Ah, no, no, not yet.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.420
But-But I will.

15:38.420 --> 15:42.620
For now, have fun.
Enjoy the books.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.460
If you want to read anything
prior to 2010,

15:45.460 --> 15:47.330
use these protective gloves.

15:48.330 --> 15:50.330
Dad?

15:50.330 --> 15:52.250
I-I thought you went out
to fix that motor.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.620
No, good news.
I got there late,
the boat sank.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.380
It's good news because
I didn't have to fix anything.

15:58.380 --> 16:00.880
And someone's coming here
tomorrow to buy a boat.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.210
Hey.

16:04.210 --> 16:06.380
Isn't that the kid
you guys put on
the Dead To Diaz list?

16:06.380 --> 16:07.670
Y-Yeah, yeah.

16:07.670 --> 16:10.380
He's just here shopping
for...

16:10.380 --> 16:12.120
an anchor.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.250
Like teenage boys do.

16:14.250 --> 16:15.380
I-I'll ring him up.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.670
Here's the one
you're looking for.

16:21.670 --> 16:23.330
Comes out to $107.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.380
Look, Ethan,

16:25.380 --> 16:27.000
you're cool and all,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.080
but we're either friends
or we're not.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.580
Let me know
when you figure it out.

16:30.580 --> 16:33.500
Until then, I'm taking
your Vampilot 6.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.710
It's a long walk home.

16:39.670 --> 16:41.420
You didn't tell me
it was his birthday!

16:41.420 --> 16:44.460
You seemed nervous.
I didn't want to put
any more pressure on you.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.830
So, how did it go?
I want every detail.

16:46.830 --> 16:49.460
Funny you want details
when you're so fond
of leaving them out.

16:49.460 --> 16:50.880
How'd he handle
the breakup?

16:50.880 --> 16:53.750
Pretty well--
probably because I never
got to that part.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.120
-He had a lot
of presents to open.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.330
By the way, his parents say hi.

16:58.330 --> 17:01.330
And he's coming over later
because the reason
you weren't with me

17:01.330 --> 17:03.120
was that you were planning
a party for him here.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.620
He's coming here?!
Harley!

17:05.620 --> 17:07.380
Hey, this is your fault!

17:07.380 --> 17:10.380
The birthday thing
caught me off guard
and I started rambling.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.420
FYI, you're baking him
his favorite cake.

17:12.420 --> 17:15.120
Oh, and you should probably
get him a gift.

17:15.120 --> 17:17.250
Not a book, though.
He got a ton of those.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.380
A cake? You went over there
and made it worse.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.500
-Thanks a lot.
-Don't be mad at me.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.420
I told you I'd never
broken up with anybody before.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.750
You still haven't.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.040
Ohh. I wish Rachel were here.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.500
She would talk to Wyatt
and he would be gone
in a hot second.

17:29.500 --> 17:33.000
Great idea. Let's buy her
a plane ticket home
to do the dirty work.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.380
Not fast enough.

17:34.380 --> 17:37.460
We need a heartless assassin
who's in the same country.

17:40.170 --> 17:45.040
Anyone else got
a problem with my spoons?

17:45.040 --> 17:47.380
Okay.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.830
Hit the bricks, Unicorn!

17:50.540 --> 17:53.620
Great. Now Blue Fairy's crying.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.830
How can I enjoy my tea
with all that blubbering!

18:04.710 --> 18:08.080
So what we're saying is,
we'd like for you to break up
with Wyatt for me.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.670
No, thanks.

18:09.670 --> 18:12.620
We're all enjoying
our scones. Right?

18:12.620 --> 18:14.380
If you don't help us,

18:14.380 --> 18:16.460
I'll use my heart rate monitor
to find out

18:16.460 --> 18:18.330
if you were the one
who took Abuela's candy.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.790
-Like you have a--

18:20.790 --> 18:23.380
Someone ate all the candy
that Abuela sent us.

18:23.380 --> 18:25.460
-No!

18:25.460 --> 18:27.790
-Uh--Lewie took it!

18:27.790 --> 18:30.040
Beast took it!
Dad took it!

18:30.040 --> 18:32.080
Would you excuse me?
I have to go to the bathroom.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.790
Aah! Get her!
She's the one who
took the candy!

18:34.790 --> 18:36.120
All right, all right,
I'll do it!

18:36.120 --> 18:37.500
But I keep the candy.

18:40.290 --> 18:42.420
Hey, Dad?
There's something important

18:42.420 --> 18:44.330
I need to talk to you about.

18:44.330 --> 18:46.830
Have you seen that video
where the man is friends
with the goose?

18:46.830 --> 18:49.000
Yeah! You're like,
"What are these two
doing together?"

18:49.000 --> 18:51.290
-But it totally works.
-Exactly.

18:51.290 --> 18:54.460
Aiden and I are friends,

18:54.460 --> 18:57.000
and I'm the one who put him
on the Dead To Diaz list
for Harley.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.540
Oh.

18:58.540 --> 19:02.380
When Harley finds out,
she'll think I betrayed her.

19:02.380 --> 19:05.670
If I stay loyal to my sister,
I have to lose my friend.

19:05.670 --> 19:07.500
What do I do?

19:07.500 --> 19:09.620
I'm sorry, I can't make
this decision.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.000
You're gonna have to
do it yourself.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.420
I don't want Harley
to be mad at me.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.790
Well, she might be.

19:15.790 --> 19:19.670
But that's the good thing about
family--no matter what choices
you make, good or bad,

19:19.670 --> 19:21.540
your family's
not going anywhere.

19:21.540 --> 19:22.920
They're stuck with you
for life.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.540
Thanks, Dad.
I guess I have a lot
to think about.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.040
You know what
helps me think?

19:30.040 --> 19:33.120
Scrubbing algae.
It's very therapeutic.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.290
Hmm.

19:34.290 --> 19:36.580
Thanks for coming by.

19:36.580 --> 19:39.120
Make yourself comfortable.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.620
I will be over there.

19:41.620 --> 19:43.710
Oh. Uh, is this
a surprise party?

19:43.710 --> 19:45.460
Because Harley already told me
there's gonna be a party.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.710
Don't worry.
There's a surprise.

19:50.170 --> 19:51.960
Hello, Wyatt.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.620
May I offer you
a refreshment?

20:04.540 --> 20:07.710
Umm. Sorry.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.670
Thank you.

20:20.540 --> 20:23.290
I understand
today is your birthday.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.290
-Yes.
-Happy birthday.

20:26.540 --> 20:27.710
Cake?

20:36.540 --> 20:38.000
Sure.

20:56.580 --> 21:00.750
February birthday--
that would make you
an Aquarius.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.330
I find that the weakest
of all the signs.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.460
Pisces, actually.
I'm on the cusp--

21:05.460 --> 21:08.170
Enough small talk.
You've been dumped.
Tissue?

21:20.330 --> 21:21.710
Haha.

21:21.710 --> 21:24.170
Georgie, what's going on?

21:24.170 --> 21:26.580
Okay...
here she goes.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.000
I'm breaking up with you.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.330
Are we done here?
I'm meeting Blue Fairy
for an apology lunch.

21:36.330 --> 21:39.120
I can't wait to hear her beg.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.670
Uh, I don't understand.

21:41.670 --> 21:44.790
-We broke up weeks ago.
!

21:44.790 --> 21:47.880
Yeah, don't you remember
when I said I wanted to
see other people?

21:47.880 --> 21:50.750
We were in the recovery room
for your laser eye surgery.

21:50.750 --> 21:53.710
I-I thought you meant
you wanted to see
other people.

21:53.710 --> 21:56.830
Oh. It was "see"
and "go out with."

21:56.830 --> 21:59.170
So, what you're saying is,

21:59.170 --> 22:03.210
these last few weeks
we've been hanging out
as friends?

22:03.210 --> 22:06.040
♪ Sittin' here daydreamin' ♪

22:06.040 --> 22:09.420
♪ 'Bout how you see me ♪

22:09.420 --> 22:12.290
No, thanks.
I'm not in the mood.

22:12.290 --> 22:14.540
You should be happy.

22:14.540 --> 22:16.670
This is what you wanted,
right?

22:16.670 --> 22:20.250
I did, but I'm not good
at letting things go.

22:20.250 --> 22:23.290
I get sad when I sell
my old clothes at a yard sale.

22:23.290 --> 22:25.500
They don't fit,
and I don't want them,

22:25.500 --> 22:27.750
but still.

22:27.750 --> 22:31.170
I miss Wyatt like I miss
those red clogs
that gave me blisters.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.250
Decisions are tough--

22:35.250 --> 22:37.420
even for the best of us.

22:37.420 --> 22:39.670
Sometimes you can't decide
what to do.

22:39.670 --> 22:42.000
So, what do you
want to watch?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.710
I don't know.

22:43.710 --> 22:44.670
It's all right.

22:44.670 --> 22:47.120
I'll decide.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.330
Sometimes you need some help.

22:51.460 --> 22:54.710
And sometimes, you need
someone to do it for you.

22:54.710 --> 22:57.250
So, we...can't hang out anymore?

22:58.380 --> 23:00.040
Don't drag this out.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.620
It's my second one of these
today, and I'm tired.

23:04.380 --> 23:07.120
Boys. So pathetic.
