00:11.690 --> 00:12.427
Tonight,

00:12.616 --> 00:14.553
James drives a Rolls-Royce,

00:15.265 --> 00:17.476
Richard drives a Bugatti Veyron,

00:18.025 --> 00:19.206
and I drive something

00:19.258 --> 00:20.972
that isn't either of those things

00:28.301 --> 00:29.578
Hello. Good evening.

00:30.478 --> 00:32.081
Good evening and thank you very much.

00:33.142 --> 00:34.908
Thank you so much. Thanks. Now...

00:35.799 --> 00:36.880
We start tonight

00:36.957 --> 00:37.805
with a letter:

00:38.697 --> 00:39.760
<i>"Dear Top Gear,</i>

00:39.997 --> 00:41.051
<i>why, oh, why</i>

00:41.103 --> 00:42.852
<i>don't you feature more cars</i>

00:42.920 --> 00:43.692
<i>aimed at</i>

00:43.777 --> 00:44.703
<i>ordinary people</i>

00:44.780 --> 00:45.526
<i>like me?</i>

00:45.921 --> 00:46.966
<i>Yours sincerely,</i>

00:47.009 --> 00:48.375
<i>Mr. R. Abramovich</i>

00:48.435 --> 00:49.086
<i>of Chelsea."</i>

00:50.269 --> 00:51.640
Well, Mr Abramovich,

00:52.191 --> 00:53.843
our man of the people, James May,

00:53.913 --> 00:55.578
was only too happy to oblige.

00:57.614 --> 00:59.231
Perhaps this is what he's on about.

00:59.899 --> 01:01.364
No, not the gin palace.

01:05.848 --> 01:06.564
This.

01:09.914 --> 01:10.819
The new

01:10.972 --> 01:12.088
Rolls-Royce

01:12.487 --> 01:13.592
Phantom

01:14.285 --> 01:15.237
Drophead.

01:23.585 --> 01:24.784
As I'm sure you know,

01:24.831 --> 01:26.430
on Top Gear, if a car spends

01:26.582 --> 01:28.780
too long sitting on the deck of an aircraft carrier,

01:29.109 --> 01:31.401
it eventually gets launched off the ramp thing

01:31.624 --> 01:32.506
down at the end.

01:33.024 --> 01:34.470
And this definitely isn't going to fly

01:34.799 --> 01:36.397
because it weighs 2.6 tonnes.

01:36.550 --> 01:37.197
So,

01:37.244 --> 01:38.419
let's be on our way.

01:40.382 --> 01:43.061
This really isn't the sort of car you want to drop into the ocean

01:44.518 --> 01:45.776
Largely because it costs

01:45.964 --> 01:47.574
307,000 pounds.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.587
That's 50,000 more

01:51.940 --> 01:54.067
than the Rolls-Royce Phantom Saloon

01:54.126 --> 01:55.713
which we tested a few years ago,

01:55.936 --> 01:58.581
and which, I have to say, we liked rather a lot.

02:04.059 --> 02:05.693
So, what are you paying the extra for,

02:05.833 --> 02:07.266
aside from the drop-top?

02:07.431 --> 02:09.500
Well, you certainly get a lot more metal-working

02:09.547 --> 02:12.179
because, to keep the Drophead's body rigid,

02:12.660 --> 02:15.359
Rolls gave it to their adoptive parents at BMW

02:15.551 --> 02:16.868
who added another

02:16.938 --> 02:18.678
460 feet

02:18.748 --> 02:19.877
of welding.

02:21.428 --> 02:23.285
And they did that at their Centre

02:23.392 --> 02:25.225
For Aluminium Competence.

02:25.860 --> 02:27.776
I'm not making that up, that is what it's called.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.433
They're Germans.

02:33.146 --> 02:35.825
Otherwise, it has the same 6.75 litre engine

02:35.861 --> 02:36.636
as the Phantom,

02:36.836 --> 02:37.823
the same top speed

02:38.059 --> 02:39.539
and the same 0-60 time.

02:45.072 --> 02:45.565
So,

02:45.636 --> 02:47.175
the mechanicals are the same.

02:47.574 --> 02:48.479
But the image,

02:48.879 --> 02:50.101
very different.

02:51.946 --> 02:53.016
The saloon

02:53.251 --> 02:55.096
is the sort of car that you could hide in.

02:55.155 --> 02:56.917
You can sit in the back behind the tinted glass

02:56.964 --> 02:58.398
and just pretend to be selling

02:58.680 --> 03:00.125
Russian gas or whatever

03:00.360 --> 03:01.677
on your laptop.

03:02.876 --> 03:03.933
But with the Drophead,

03:04.145 --> 03:05.708
it will be you who's doing the driving.

03:06.630 --> 03:08.827
You don't really want to ride in the back of this car,

03:08.885 --> 03:09.861
unless, perhaps,

03:10.014 --> 03:12.024
you're the Queen of England or Elton John.

03:12.752 --> 03:14.163
Which is the same thing, really.

03:20.706 --> 03:21.118
So,

03:21.318 --> 03:22.434
you'll be sitting up front,

03:22.540 --> 03:24.021
for all the world to see,

03:24.115 --> 03:25.925
in a car that's hardly discreet,

03:26.172 --> 03:28.205
and this is why I'm driving it around town

03:28.263 --> 03:29.250
at night:

03:29.344 --> 03:30.578
because the producer thought

03:30.649 --> 03:32.141
I'd be too embarrassed

03:32.200 --> 03:33.223
in daylight.

03:36.161 --> 03:38.079
But why would I be embarrassed?

03:38.337 --> 03:39.830
If this was truly vulgar,

03:40.018 --> 03:40.700
maybe,

03:41.017 --> 03:41.863
but it isn't.

03:42.227 --> 03:43.403
It's exquisite.

03:45.824 --> 03:46.435
This lot

03:46.576 --> 03:48.702
don't do carbon fibre

03:48.867 --> 03:50.289
but they will let you have this

03:50.559 --> 03:52.146
teak decking at the back,

03:52.440 --> 03:54.226
like you might find on a motor launch.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.447
And they will also let you have the bonnet

03:56.894 --> 03:58.150
finished in

03:58.197 --> 03:59.631
brushed stainless steel.

04:00.477 --> 04:01.112
And

04:01.617 --> 04:03.674
other car manufacturers are currently spending

04:03.791 --> 04:05.872
millions and millions of pounds on research

04:05.942 --> 04:07.376
into hydrogen fuel cells

04:07.541 --> 04:08.621
and hybrid drive

04:08.762 --> 04:09.738
but Rolls-Royce

04:09.832 --> 04:11.172
spends the same money

04:12.147 --> 04:14.181
in its ashtray design department.

04:14.592 --> 04:15.415
Look at that!

04:17.000 --> 04:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.268 --> 04:27.985
Furthermore,

04:28.067 --> 04:29.666
you won't be overwhelmed by all

04:29.805 --> 04:31.510
the flashing lights and gizmos and gadgets

04:31.604 --> 04:33.837
that you'd find in a BMW 7 Series

04:33.989 --> 04:35.153
or a Maybach.

04:36.834 --> 04:37.703
I don't have

04:38.044 --> 04:39.440
ten different settings

04:39.569 --> 04:41.309
for the ride firmness, I don't have

04:41.826 --> 04:44.412
five different speeds at which the interior lights

04:44.682 --> 04:46.609
switch off when I close the door.

04:46.868 --> 04:48.725
It's more like a butler, this car.

04:48.937 --> 04:49.677
It just sort of

04:49.817 --> 04:51.710
takes care of everything for you

04:51.968 --> 04:53.296
and you don't even notice.

05:03.202 --> 05:04.471
Like the Phantom Saloon,

05:04.694 --> 05:06.610
the Drophead doesn't follow the herd.

05:07.092 --> 05:08.726
It has its own ideas about

05:08.820 --> 05:10.359
what a luxury car should be.

05:10.993 --> 05:11.816
You can't order

05:11.957 --> 05:12.827
a sports pack

05:12.874 --> 05:14.237
or a flappy-paddle gearbox

05:14.496 --> 05:14.966
but

05:15.025 --> 05:16.235
you CAN choose from

05:16.815 --> 05:18.872
44,000 shades of paint.

05:23.397 --> 05:24.737
You know that teak decking?

05:25.524 --> 05:26.946
When you take the car for a service

05:27.121 --> 05:28.144
a man in an apron

05:28.320 --> 05:29.319
oils it for you,

05:29.742 --> 05:31.670
like you might your favourite cricket bat.

05:35.948 --> 05:36.901
And when it rains,

05:37.089 --> 05:39.745
yes, you call on an old-fashioned soft-top,

05:39.886 --> 05:41.285
instead of some trendy,

05:41.438 --> 05:43.036
folding, metal origami.

05:43.530 --> 05:44.987
But that soft-top

05:45.058 --> 05:46.703
is lined with cashmere.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.282
And yet,

05:51.412 --> 05:53.069
for all its teak and stainless

05:53.116 --> 05:54.268
steel and cashmere,

05:54.397 --> 05:56.407
the Drophead just doesn't come across as

05:56.747 --> 05:58.333
brash, or in-your-face.

05:58.827 --> 06:00.484
I like to think you could leave it

06:00.602 --> 06:02.153
in the rougher parts of town

06:02.341 --> 06:03.763
and no-one would hurt it.

06:04.891 --> 06:05.737
Yo!

06:06.113 --> 06:07.171
I love you!

06:07.524 --> 06:08.922
Let's not try it out, though, eh?

06:16.065 --> 06:17.535
This is, without doubt,

06:17.629 --> 06:19.121
a proper Rolls-Royce.

06:19.415 --> 06:20.543
Wonderful to drive,

06:20.931 --> 06:21.930
beautifully made.

06:22.647 --> 06:23.952
But there's something else.

06:24.563 --> 06:26.232
Here's an amazing thing.

06:26.301 --> 06:27.817
Rolls-Royce is the most

06:27.876 --> 06:30.156
established marque in the history of motoring.

06:30.344 --> 06:31.108
It has

06:31.202 --> 06:32.965
the most pompous radiator grille.

06:33.141 --> 06:34.916
It has the most ridiculous mascot.

06:35.257 --> 06:36.174
And yet,

06:36.326 --> 06:37.524
this car's very,

06:38.147 --> 06:39.204
very cool.

06:39.792 --> 06:42.295
I think this might be the coolest car in the world.

06:51.297 --> 06:53.459
You said it wasn't brash?

06:53.506 --> 06:54.987
Yeah, it's not like clock too tall...

06:58.752 --> 07:00.820
I'd better say I'm with you, it's an exquisite car.

07:01.584 --> 07:02.560
Trouble is, though.

07:02.806 --> 07:04.229
When the roof comes back,

07:04.252 --> 07:05.768
You know, a cloche in a stupid restaurant,

07:05.839 --> 07:06.920
when they go, "Ta-daaa!"

07:07.542 --> 07:09.093
Oh yeah, "any more convertible at all?"

07:09.223 --> 07:10.433
Yes, I know, and you sit...

07:10.516 --> 07:11.973
You sit in the damn thing

07:12.032 --> 07:14.441
and it's like sitting in a convertible Range Rover, you sit high up.

07:14.629 --> 07:16.486
You feel so conspicuous!

07:16.790 --> 07:18.260
I didn't feel conspicuous in it.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.258
The thing is, I believe,

07:20.328 --> 07:21.668
deep in my heart, that

07:21.797 --> 07:23.396
I looked good in it, and it suits me,

07:23.819 --> 07:25.018
'Cos it's stylish and it's

07:25.194 --> 07:26.163
contemporary.

07:28.032 --> 07:31.463
Every time I see you those are the words that pop into my head:

07:31.546 --> 07:33.332
Stylish and contemporary!

07:33.379 --> 07:35.189
After other words, like, for instance

07:35.460 --> 07:36.223
... beige!

07:37.010 --> 07:38.244
Standard stairlift

07:38.350 --> 07:39.619
The War, wanna hear any more?

07:40.231 --> 07:41.206
Homosexual!

07:42.993 --> 07:43.980
I object to the beige!

07:46.600 --> 07:47.811
Now, the news.

07:47.892 --> 07:50.188
Imagine if you will that you bought a Bugatti Veyron,...

07:50.599 --> 07:51.777
It's a big investment...

07:51.871 --> 07:54.031
You'd be very excited about the day it was gonna be arrived,

07:54.125 --> 07:56.415
So you'd imagine such a thing would be delivered

07:56.844 --> 07:58.786
You know, on like a golden carriage,

07:58.866 --> 08:01.076
on a bed of swan's feathers, it's a special moment.

08:01.170 --> 08:02.148
I'd want mine...

08:02.326 --> 08:04.213
born aloft by sixteen...

08:04.483 --> 08:06.295
greased, naked eunuchs...

08:07.209 --> 08:08.170
That's what I'd want.

08:08.275 --> 08:09.787
Whatever, the point is

08:09.892 --> 08:11.649
that's the sort of thing you'd expect,

08:11.704 --> 08:13.080
it's a big moment...

08:13.532 --> 08:15.547
In Russia they do things a little bit differently...

08:15.594 --> 08:16.544
Here is one, it's

08:16.661 --> 08:17.809
being transported...

08:18.578 --> 08:19.762
That's a Bugatti!

08:20.606 --> 08:22.996
I brrought yourr Bugatti, sirr, it is herre...

08:23.207 --> 08:24.789
Why is it on a flatbed pickup?

08:24.836 --> 08:26.242
Your??????

08:26.324 --> 08:27.813
That's a disappointment in your life.

08:28.047 --> 08:28.956
Now, anyone

08:29.003 --> 08:30.351
parked in London recently?

08:30.913 --> 08:31.253
No.

08:31.347 --> 08:33.924
You see, the problem is no more parking meters are pay'n'display.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.796
What you do is you pull up and there's a sign, we've got a picture of one here...

08:37.073 --> 08:38.748
Ok? Where you pay by phone

08:38.830 --> 08:40.143
for your parking space.

08:40.294 --> 08:41.783
Would anybody like me to try that?

08:43.248 --> 08:44.713
Ok. I have brought with me

08:44.866 --> 08:46.412
all you need: got a phone,

08:46.869 --> 08:47.678
and a credit card

08:47.739 --> 08:48.876
These are what you need, ok?

08:49.614 --> 08:51.384
I've got a microphone so you can hear what I'm doing.

08:51.548 --> 08:53.809
- Just give me the number. 0-8...
- 7-0...

08:53.950 --> 08:55.614
- 7-0, yep...
- 4-2-8

08:56.095 --> 08:56.985
4-2-8...

08:57.173 --> 08:58.263
4-00-9.

08:58.359 --> 08:59.390
4-00-9.

08:59.461 --> 09:00.973
This puts me through to...

09:01.219 --> 09:02.531
a laptop in India...

09:03.281 --> 09:05.754
Here you go. Got the microphone ready, I'll put the speaker on.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.174
<i>Brooke to Westminster...</i>

09:08.294 --> 09:09.617
<i>Option Service</i>

09:09.909 --> 09:12.499

09:12.593 --> 09:15.171

09:15.377 --> 09:17.264
Right. So it's 8... that's the location.

09:17.311 --> 09:18.682
8-7-44

09:19.467 --> 09:20.733
Your car's rotting at this point...

I can't read them, I need gla...

09:33.603 --> 09:35.091
You can't if you ain't got any glasses...

09:35.138 --> 09:37.235
- Give it to me, I'll read your number out loud...
- Someone will have to read it for you...

09:37.376 --> 09:39.027
- All of them...
- No, you won't do that...

09:40.773 --> 09:42.695
Someone's got some reading glasses?

09:42.777 --> 09:44.663
That's... Oh yes!

09:48.411 --> 09:50.216
They're not reading glasses!

09:50.368 --> 09:51.845
No, there we go... 7...

09:57.160 --> 09:58.484
This is to park your car!

09:58.550 --> 09:59.921
Hey, I haven't finished yet!

10:00.413 --> 10:04.690
<i>Please, press the key on which the first character of your numberplate resides...</i>

10:05.370 --> 10:05.769
Ei?

10:05.898 --> 10:08.307
Somebody give me a registration number of one of these cars...

10:08.776 --> 10:10.405
That Ferrari, was it V12...?

10:10.452 --> 10:11.073
V...

10:11.577 --> 10:12.280
V!

10:13.827 --> 10:15.522
<i>For T  press 1,</i>

10:15.580 --> 10:17.092
<i>For U press 2...</i>

10:17.268 --> 10:18.537
<i>For V...</i>

10:20.798 --> 10:21.701
Nooo!!

10:23.711 --> 10:25.797
You gotta go through the whole numberplate,

10:25.844 --> 10:27.895
pressing hundreds of thousands of numbers!

10:28.270 --> 10:30.743
I promise faithfully, the other day I was in London,

10:30.797 --> 10:32.730
I used an entire charge...

10:32.824 --> 10:33.632
<i>Numberplate retype...</i>

10:33.738 --> 10:34.500
Shut up!

10:35.297 --> 10:36.974
I used an entire charge

10:37.038 --> 10:37.922
of battery

10:38.422 --> 10:41.422
Just to get halfway through the number and the battery died.

10:41.469 --> 10:43.590
Had to go into a shop, buy a car charger,

10:43.859 --> 10:45.992
come back, then finally you get through a man that goes:

10:46.027 --> 10:47.574
"It's all right, the system doesn't work."

10:48.472 --> 10:50.851
He actually admitted it doesn't work, no one can do it.

10:51.123 --> 10:53.752
We've got to do something about Ken Livingstone.

10:54.708 --> 10:55.931
It's his fault.

10:56.092 --> 10:57.594
- ... obviously
- I have this plan...

10:57.959 --> 10:59.108
Bring him down here, all right?

10:59.247 --> 11:00.325
And set fire to him.

11:00.390 --> 11:01.302
Well, that's brilliant!

11:01.892 --> 11:03.491
That would do it! That would get rid of him...

11:07.236 --> 11:08.172
Well, look.

11:10.286 --> 11:11.048
Look!

11:12.765 --> 11:14.397
This is the problem we've got.

11:15.352 --> 11:17.294
This... You know we accidentally lit

11:17.380 --> 11:18.593
some pipes last week.

11:18.668 --> 11:19.398
A bit...

11:19.906 --> 11:20.904
A hysterical woman,

11:20.958 --> 11:22.686
who runs some hysterical organization,

11:22.750 --> 11:24.918
thin lips, the sort that take their own lunch to work,

11:25.015 --> 11:26.120
You know the sort?

11:27.451 --> 11:29.221
She got in touch and she pointed out,

11:29.361 --> 11:32.454
after having "DEMANDED an apology from the BBC"...

11:32.822 --> 11:34.034
She pointed out that,

11:34.109 --> 11:35.808
you can't smoke anything

11:36.090 --> 11:36.682
now

11:37.294 --> 11:38.627
in the studio. Anything.

11:38.668 --> 11:39.778
doesn't matter if it's herbal or tobacco,

11:39.834 --> 11:40.557
you're not allowed to.

11:40.754 --> 11:41.750
which means it is now

11:41.815 --> 11:43.130
illegal to inhale

11:43.168 --> 11:44.135
the Mayor of London

11:44.210 --> 11:45.243
if he's on fire.

11:47.454 --> 11:48.590
What if we turf him?

11:49.649 --> 11:50.607
Turf him?

11:50.983 --> 11:53.358
Is that some euphemism from those "special clubs" you go?

11:55.837 --> 11:57.415
You see a nice bloke in a leather hat,

11:57.462 --> 11:58.739
"I'd love to turf him."

12:00.846 --> 12:01.419
- It's not?
- No!

12:01.490 --> 12:02.138
All right.

12:02.203 --> 12:03.050
No, it isn't

12:03.116 --> 12:04.496
I'm thinking of that artist

12:04.524 --> 12:06.684
I can't remember his name, who turfs buildings and statues...

12:06.740 --> 12:07.811
Where do you live?!

12:08.684 --> 12:09.688
He does it in London,

12:09.735 --> 12:10.778
he did it in the South Bank,

12:10.825 --> 12:13.035
we turf Ken Livingstone, stick him on a plynth, job done.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.791
Oh, now, word of warning,

12:14.856 --> 12:15.701
You know you...

12:15.748 --> 12:18.406
... can now buy radar-guided cruise-control with your car.

12:18.445 --> 12:20.286
First to test it was Mercedes, and I liked it very much.

12:20.342 --> 12:21.403
The idea is you...

12:21.450 --> 12:22.577
You set the cruise control

12:23.009 --> 12:25.394
Go along with the speed. If a car pulls out along in front of you

12:25.534 --> 12:26.926
Your car sees it,

12:27.395 --> 12:28.832
slows you down to speed it's going,

12:28.879 --> 12:29.930
when it pulls over,

12:30.099 --> 12:32.212
you accelerate back up to the speed you selected, ok?

12:32.259 --> 12:33.301
I thought it was great,

12:33.348 --> 12:34.522
but I tried a Volvo this week.

12:34.702 --> 12:36.035
What it does when it slows down

12:36.073 --> 12:37.979
when someone... is apply the brakes

12:38.045 --> 12:39.218
and the brake lights come on.

12:39.481 --> 12:42.054
Actually, putting the brakes to slow you down is very clever.

12:42.214 --> 12:44.148
Nononono, you should never apply the brakes

12:44.188 --> 12:44.864
on a motorway.

12:44.920 --> 12:48.084
- Well, it's...
- It's the brake lights what cause all the tailbacks,

12:48.160 --> 12:49.681
People who can't maintain

12:49.746 --> 12:51.493
a constant speed. You know what I mean?

12:51.577 --> 12:52.986
Those people that drive...

12:54.427 --> 12:56.502
I'm braking, I've accelerated too close,

12:56.615 --> 12:59.394
I'd had police marksmen shoot them in the head for doing that...

13:00.014 --> 13:01.329
I have never braked

13:01.423 --> 13:02.108
on a motorway.

13:02.155 --> 13:03.096
What if something's in the way?

13:03.135 --> 13:05.028
What if somebody swerves and you're going... you...

13:05.306 --> 13:06.170
You see them coming.

13:06.373 --> 13:07.500
If it's an old Rover,

13:07.522 --> 13:10.598
you know it's being driven by a man with ears the size of a satellite dish,

13:10.655 --> 13:12.101
and you don't ever need to brake, you just...

13:12.335 --> 13:13.631
prepare yourself.

13:14.542 --> 13:17.190
Do you know the game, if you ever played the "I Have Never..." game...

13:17.312 --> 13:18.889
You think of things, you know, round the table,

13:19.068 --> 13:20.345
I've never... never braked

13:20.579 --> 13:22.429
never bought anything in Marks&Spencer,

13:22.824 --> 13:23.645
And then if you're losing

13:23.702 --> 13:25.636
you go for the "I've never used a tampon."

13:27.195 --> 13:28.209
That's a winner...

13:28.312 --> 13:29.476
I remember that, too.

13:29.711 --> 13:30.406
I have.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.210
You've used a tampon...

13:35.257 --> 13:36.017
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

13:36.130 --> 13:36.694
You know,

13:37.257 --> 13:37.980
spillage.

13:38.609 --> 13:39.726
Oh, mate, what?

13:41.088 --> 13:42.921
I had a bit of an accident on the cooker once...

13:43.052 --> 13:44.292
Sorry, this is getting worse!

13:45.052 --> 13:46.282
No, hear me out...

13:46.846 --> 13:48.029
When you're boiling something,

13:48.085 --> 13:49.259
something with milk in it, and it,...

13:49.343 --> 13:50.273
you know, it boiled over,

13:50.320 --> 13:51.317
and it goes in that bit of the back

13:51.364 --> 13:52.369
where you can't get your finger in,

13:52.425 --> 13:53.514
and if you don't clean it up...

13:54.857 --> 13:56.040
If you don't clean that out...

13:56.087 --> 13:57.862
it goes rancid and it smells forever.

13:57.946 --> 14:00.744
You used tampons to clean a cooker?!

14:01.666 --> 14:03.338
'Cos I couldn't get my finger in it!

14:03.497 --> 14:05.300
He doesn't have OCD!

14:05.488 --> 14:06.173
Listen, no...

14:06.201 --> 14:07.450
You do have OCD!

14:07.478 --> 14:08.136
I don't!

14:08.183 --> 14:09.681
You know the bezel on the watch?

14:09.831 --> 14:11.230
You know the little arrow thing here?

14:11.268 --> 14:12.056
If I have it

14:12.094 --> 14:12.873
here,

14:13.042 --> 14:14.028
it's fine.

14:14.113 --> 14:15.634
But if I put it round... Ready?

14:15.793 --> 14:16.798
There...

14:16.845 --> 14:17.962
It's like kryptonite.

14:22.009 --> 14:23.145
Go back in the wrong position.

14:23.202 --> 14:25.464
You can't... you can't bear it if I haven't got that arrow...

14:27.695 --> 14:28.483
Look!

14:32.382 --> 14:34.129
Do I say the other interesting thing about tampons?

14:36.551 --> 14:38.288
Seriously, if you've got... Has anybody got like an old...

14:38.328 --> 14:39.332
twin-cylinder motorcycle?

14:39.436 --> 14:40.637
Parallel twin. You'll know this.

14:40.675 --> 14:41.905
- You'll always get a little bit of oil...
- I WILL NOT!

14:41.961 --> 14:42.600
You will...

14:43.210 --> 14:44.130
You'll get a little bit of oil that

14:44.168 --> 14:45.437
always leaks out through the seal,

14:45.475 --> 14:46.808
when you close it, and you can't

14:46.846 --> 14:48.010
get at it to mop it up.

14:48.048 --> 14:50.226
Allright, you put a lilac on the end of a screwdriver Phillips,

14:50.339 --> 14:53.102
- Shake it... gone.
- You carry them with you on a bandolier round...

14:53.656 --> 14:56.181
like a Swcharzenegger arrangement, full of tampons

14:56.228 --> 14:57.083
just in case.

14:57.186 --> 14:59.806
It's a new application for an existing technology.

14:59.853 --> 15:01.656
- I'm adapting to...
- James, go away...

15:01.761 --> 15:03.122
Watch out... I can't stand that...

15:03.199 --> 15:04.861
- Somebody...
- He can't bear it...

15:05.030 --> 15:07.199
He honestly cannot bear it if I do that.

15:08.373 --> 15:10.195
Anyway, pray silence now,

15:10.251 --> 15:11.631
please, for the most

15:11.782 --> 15:13.741
breathtaking car we've ever had

15:14.032 --> 15:14.886
here in our studio.

15:14.933 --> 15:16.783
Here is the new Lamborghini Reventón.

15:16.825 --> 15:18.187
Re <i>b</i> entón.

15:18.365 --> 15:19.097
No, it's Reventón.

15:19.154 --> 15:20.556
No, no, <i>Rebentón</i>

15:20.592 --> 15:21.382
No, it's Reventón, I can prove it:

15:21.427 --> 15:22.434
It's got

15:22.540 --> 15:24.065
It's got a 'V': Reventón.

15:24.245 --> 15:25.643
No, I know it's spelt with a V,

15:25.665 --> 15:26.559
but it's pronounced

15:26.612 --> 15:27.393
with a B.

15:27.460 --> 15:27.934
Why?

15:27.964 --> 15:29.286
Don't know, they told us.

15:29.459 --> 15:30.067
It's B:

15:30.102 --> 15:30.980
ReBentón.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.910
Anyway, it has a 6.5 litre V12...

15:33.963 --> 15:34.766
<i>B12.</i>

15:35.067 --> 15:36.847
Yeah, whatever...

15:36.892 --> 15:37.576
It can do...

15:37.651 --> 15:38.364
<i>Whateber...</i>

15:38.577 --> 15:39.769
Please, stop...

15:40.126 --> 15:41.581
Stop, that's very annoying.

15:41.638 --> 15:42.992
It can do 212...

15:43.030 --> 15:44.382
- <i>Bery</i> annoying...
- Leave it!!

15:45.451 --> 15:47.105
It is an awe-inspiring car.

15:47.143 --> 15:49.753
It is, and honestly, I'm with you. It's styled to look

15:49.800 --> 15:51.397
like an F-22 Raptor,

15:51.443 --> 15:52.889
you know, the new stealth fighter.

15:53.115 --> 15:53.894
And it really does, it's...

15:53.941 --> 15:55.688
This is what Lamborghini should be doing:

15:55.727 --> 15:57.379
Making cars where you just go...

15:59.239 --> 16:00.581
Just fantastic!

16:00.619 --> 16:02.178
And it's not just on the outside,

16:02.236 --> 16:03.644
it's clever inside, too.

16:03.701 --> 16:04.931
We've got some pictures here...

16:04.996 --> 16:06.039
The dashboard is a

16:06.117 --> 16:08.856
thin liquid film transistor like you get on aircraft.

16:09.053 --> 16:10.302
That's on car setting.

16:10.453 --> 16:12.528
If we switch it now to aircraft setting...

16:12.575 --> 16:13.467
Look at that!

16:13.521 --> 16:15.765
I want that in my life...

16:15.868 --> 16:17.558
It's just covered in things you want!

16:17.615 --> 16:18.882
Round here, the rear lights,

16:18.929 --> 16:20.647
LEDs in little arrow shapes.

16:20.835 --> 16:22.507
These enormous fans down here,

16:22.535 --> 16:23.596
behind these grilles.

16:23.793 --> 16:25.516
And round here, the wheels.

16:25.647 --> 16:27.441
They've got carbon fibre fins on them

16:27.488 --> 16:29.957
that act as a giant fan to suck in cold air

16:30.290 --> 16:31.408
to cool the brakes. And just

16:31.464 --> 16:33.355
Just a fuel-filler cap, look at that!

16:33.459 --> 16:34.313
Couple of problems:

16:34.360 --> 16:36.566
One, they're only making 20, only one is coming to Britain.

16:36.623 --> 16:37.759
The other thing is:

16:37.834 --> 16:40.210
800,000 pounds.

16:40.510 --> 16:41.712
That is quite a lot.

16:42.426 --> 16:44.325
But with this you would get a lot of badge.

16:45.019 --> 16:45.864
Badge?

16:48.897 --> 16:50.184
Think we got away with that...

16:50.231 --> 16:52.268
So, let's move on to Ferrari.

16:52.662 --> 16:53.970
Now, in the olden days,

16:54.065 --> 16:56.733
they used to build their racing cars with a lot of passion.

16:56.993 --> 16:58.461
and enthusiasm, and then,

16:58.706 --> 16:59.741
on lap three,

16:59.782 --> 17:01.469
they would explode as often as not in a...

17:01.634 --> 17:03.725
passionate and enthusiastic fireball.

17:04.215 --> 17:05.340
But then, a few years ago,

17:05.396 --> 17:07.569
they started building their racing cars with science

17:07.637 --> 17:08.502
and Maths.

17:08.544 --> 17:10.045
And since then, as we know, they've been

17:10.414 --> 17:11.311
top of the tree.

17:11.717 --> 17:13.630
So now, Ferrari is putting

17:13.856 --> 17:15.152
science and Maths

17:15.398 --> 17:17.172
into its road cars as well...

17:25.214 --> 17:26.902
This is the 599.

17:29.532 --> 17:31.287
It has a six-litre V12

17:31.329 --> 17:32.878
with variable valve timing

17:32.913 --> 17:34.124
on each of its four cams

17:34.159 --> 17:37.285
and magneto-rheological shock absorbers.

17:38.019 --> 17:39.765
It has lights on the steering wheel

17:39.793 --> 17:41.356
telling you when to change gear

17:41.390 --> 17:43.859
and then there's the gearbox itself.

17:44.385 --> 17:46.189
When I pull this paddle here,

17:46.587 --> 17:48.136
the clutch disengages,

17:48.198 --> 17:49.398
the cogs are swapped

17:49.439 --> 17:51.145
and the clutch re-engages,

17:51.494 --> 17:53.702
all in 100 milliseconds.

17:54.161 --> 17:54.929
Ready...

17:56.001 --> 17:57.523
Yeah, 100 milliseconds.

18:03.318 --> 18:04.998
See that diffuser at the back?

18:05.121 --> 18:06.143
That's generating

18:06.239 --> 18:08.589
165 kgs of downforce,

18:08.709 --> 18:09.740
That is...

18:09.811 --> 18:11.686
That's about that much...

18:15.959 --> 18:18.970
You can't even start this car in the normal way.

18:19.427 --> 18:21.085
To get it off the line,

18:21.331 --> 18:23.476
you pull that paddle to put it in... No!

18:24.730 --> 18:25.948
No. Wait. You turn...

18:26.593 --> 18:29.077
the traction control off, yeah, that's that done,

18:29.206 --> 18:30.988
then you pull this paddle,

18:31.053 --> 18:32.108
to put it in first.

18:32.248 --> 18:34.522
Then you press the launch control button,

18:34.604 --> 18:35.776
Now the L's flashing,

18:35.834 --> 18:37.779
and then you put your left foot on the brake,

18:38.506 --> 18:39.990
build up the revs...

18:41.349 --> 18:43.435
Then you take your foot off the brake...

18:52.655 --> 18:54.600
That was hugely impressive.

18:55.650 --> 18:57.338
But I'll let you into a little secret.

18:57.959 --> 18:59.213
Launch control

18:59.353 --> 19:01.076
is primarily designed

19:01.165 --> 19:04.235
for fat, useless drivers to impress their friends

19:04.387 --> 19:06.497
with all the tyre smoke and so on.

19:08.219 --> 19:09.801
There's another, quicker way

19:10.294 --> 19:11.946
of getting this car off the line.

19:12.071 --> 19:14.625
Ferrari won't thank me for this, but what you do is:

19:14.953 --> 19:16.149
put it in Race...

19:17.121 --> 19:19.981
OK? Then you hold this paddle down for two seconds.

19:20.719 --> 19:21.195
There it is...

19:21.242 --> 19:23.117
It says "Transmission Failure", but don't worry.

19:23.257 --> 19:24.183
Left foot on the brake,

19:24.242 --> 19:25.660
don't turn the launch control on,

19:25.941 --> 19:27.218
build up the revs.

19:34.740 --> 19:35.760
That's phenomenal.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.787
The onboard computer's just got me

19:37.846 --> 19:39.135
from 0 to 60

19:40.260 --> 19:41.643
in 3.5 seconds.

19:42.308 --> 19:43.468
3.5!

19:43.585 --> 19:46.374
in a car that weighs nearly two tons!

19:48.284 --> 19:49.597
More amazing still,

19:49.655 --> 19:51.730
in the time it takes a two-litre Mondeo

19:51.788 --> 19:53.171
to get from 0 to 60,

19:53.735 --> 19:56.266
the 599 will get you from 0

19:56.348 --> 19:57.837
to 150!

20:02.466 --> 20:03.719
And then there's the way

20:03.790 --> 20:05.438
it goes round corners.

20:05.919 --> 20:06.856
What I do

20:06.927 --> 20:08.415
in a normal fast car

20:08.474 --> 20:10.032
coming round here is brake...

20:10.337 --> 20:11.298
turn in,

20:11.544 --> 20:13.079
you feel the grip, OK?

20:13.473 --> 20:15.266
And then you balance the throttle

20:15.570 --> 20:18.008
to hold it on the limit of grip, and then

20:18.195 --> 20:20.562
you call the tow truck to pull you out of the field.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.976
In this, however,

20:23.035 --> 20:24.894
things are a little bit different.

20:25.081 --> 20:27.355
I simply choose what sort of

20:27.589 --> 20:28.937
cornering I'd like to do

20:28.995 --> 20:30.800
with this little switch.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.825
So, if I put it here...

20:33.167 --> 20:34.702
I can make it do this.

20:40.627 --> 20:42.373
Or if I put it here,

20:42.619 --> 20:44.564
I can make it do this.

20:48.994 --> 20:50.834
Hold onto your spleen, everyone!

20:54.216 --> 20:56.485
Or if you're feeling brave

20:56.543 --> 20:57.551
and talented,

20:57.598 --> 20:59.801
you can turn the system off all together,

21:00.387 --> 21:01.805
in which case you'll corner

21:02.039 --> 21:03.012
like this.

21:07.699 --> 21:08.566
Oh, dear!

21:12.011 --> 21:13.218
Big cloud of smoke!

21:14.631 --> 21:15.897
And then it stalls.

21:19.049 --> 21:21.006
To be honest, I don't really like

21:21.112 --> 21:22.237
any of this

21:22.841 --> 21:24.165
electronic stuff.

21:24.212 --> 21:26.298
I'm not the sort of person who spends his evening

21:26.603 --> 21:27.669
on Bebo

21:27.951 --> 21:29.087
or Myface,

21:30.060 --> 21:31.302
but I will admit...

21:31.396 --> 21:32.708
when it all comes together,

21:32.826 --> 21:34.064
the effect is, um...

21:35.271 --> 21:36.455
... profound.

21:40.931 --> 21:41.752
In short,

21:41.857 --> 21:43.439
this does for other cars

21:43.533 --> 21:44.517
what the laptop did

21:44.599 --> 21:46.286
for the typewriter.

21:46.509 --> 21:48.841
And because it's so high-tech, it's easy to drive.

21:48.934 --> 21:50.270
You might even imagine

21:50.329 --> 21:52.345
you could use a 599

21:52.567 --> 21:53.985
for trips to the shops.

21:56.502 --> 21:58.893
But not so fast on that one.

22:02.289 --> 22:03.156
In the past,

22:03.226 --> 22:06.004
this was the natural stomping ground of the Ferrari,

22:06.355 --> 22:07.245
under a cover,

22:07.667 --> 22:08.722
in a garage

22:09.682 --> 22:11.346
and with good reason.

22:11.826 --> 22:13.338
The 512 was

22:13.408 --> 22:15.389
too difficult and heavy to be used

22:15.483 --> 22:16.748
as an everyday car.

22:19.291 --> 22:20.001
The Enzo

22:20.060 --> 22:21.243
has problems too.

22:21.525 --> 22:23.493
It was only available with left-hand drive,

22:23.552 --> 22:26.505
so if you pulled up at a slightly oblique junction,

22:27.044 --> 22:28.532
you couldn't see what was coming.

22:31.531 --> 22:33.453
The 599, though, looks

22:33.570 --> 22:35.773
as though it gets round these problems.

22:36.804 --> 22:38.363
There's a parcel shelf in the back

22:38.457 --> 22:39.629
for your golf clubs.

22:40.086 --> 22:41.559
Service intervals are every

22:41.629 --> 22:43.023
12,500 miles

22:43.117 --> 22:44.945
and because the engine's in the front...

22:45.719 --> 22:47.172
it has a big boot.

22:47.852 --> 22:49.469
Don't, however, be fooled,

22:49.996 --> 22:52.149
because there are one or two little issues.

22:52.429 --> 22:55.452
I took one of these out on the roads near where I live the other day

22:55.523 --> 22:56.753
and it was so wide

22:56.800 --> 22:59.097
I spent most of my time in the ditch

22:59.249 --> 23:00.861
or the hedge trying to avoid people

23:00.908 --> 23:01.916
coming the other way.

23:02.104 --> 23:04.834
The headlights were like candles in jam jars,

23:05.526 --> 23:08.045
the automatic wipers turned themselves on

23:08.197 --> 23:09.908
every time it stopped raining,

23:10.384 --> 23:12.224
The air-conditioning system had a mind of its own

23:12.376 --> 23:13.372
it kept steaming up.

23:13.501 --> 23:15.106
And the ambient lighting,

23:15.177 --> 23:18.095
designed to bathe the interior in a warm glow,

23:18.329 --> 23:20.580
lit the whole thing up like a battlefield.

23:20.768 --> 23:21.776
You really couldn't

23:21.823 --> 23:24.108
buy a 599 to use every day.

23:26.756 --> 23:28.080
More worryingly, though,

23:28.268 --> 23:29.733
I wouldn't buy one at all.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.599
You see, if it's a car you can only really use on

23:32.763 --> 23:35.048
special occasions, you want it to feel...

23:35.130 --> 23:35.939
special.

23:37.228 --> 23:39.068
..and somehow it doesn't.

23:40.379 --> 23:42.207
Technically, it's brilliant.

23:42.301 --> 23:43.543
I respect it

23:43.660 --> 23:44.469
hugely,

23:44.563 --> 23:47.692
in the same way that I respect the technology in my iPod,

23:48.067 --> 23:49.344
but I don't love it.

23:49.715 --> 23:51.051
And that's why if I were gonna

23:51.122 --> 23:54.016
blow £185,000 on a Ferrari,

23:54.122 --> 23:56.465
I'd walk right past the 599

23:56.688 --> 23:58.340
and get one of these:

24:12.779 --> 24:14.818
It's a Ferrari 275 GTS.

24:16.002 --> 24:18.017
Even by the standards of the day,

24:18.380 --> 24:20.338
1964, it was...

24:20.666 --> 24:21.650
rubbish!

24:22.765 --> 24:24.301
The prop-shaft, for instance,

24:24.371 --> 24:26.574
that links the engine at the front to the gearbox at the back,

24:26.621 --> 24:28.789
was never aligned properly, so it'd wear out

24:29.035 --> 24:29.867
immediately.

24:30.425 --> 24:33.273
And that was a good thing, actually, because it meant owners

24:33.718 --> 24:35.815
didn't have a chance to find out that the brakes

24:35.874 --> 24:37.761
were actually milk bottle tops.

24:38.546 --> 24:39.507
They'd stop you...

24:40.386 --> 24:41.042
once.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.113
And, you know what?

24:45.379 --> 24:46.726
None of that matters,

24:46.879 --> 24:48.543
because, look at it...

24:49.234 --> 24:51.894
It's 14 feet of almost nothing but

24:51.988 --> 24:54.448
passion and flair and style.

24:54.624 --> 24:56.944
So when you drive it once a year, maybe,

24:57.812 --> 24:59.019
it makes you feel...

24:59.616 --> 25:00.554
special.

25:01.409 --> 25:02.581
The 599

25:03.272 --> 25:06.092
is just a bucket-load of science and maths,

25:06.795 --> 25:08.728
this 275 is...

25:09.760 --> 25:10.744
is what matters.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.619
It's heart and soul.

25:20.537 --> 25:21.357
Look at this.

25:21.428 --> 25:22.728
It is amazing!

25:24.041 --> 25:25.951
As a technical exercise,

25:26.021 --> 25:28.412
As a technical exercise it's just...

25:28.517 --> 25:29.326
astonishing.

25:29.478 --> 25:31.044
The science and maths is phenomenal in it,

25:31.126 --> 25:31.969
it really is.

25:32.063 --> 25:33.868
And would you really rather have

25:34.173 --> 25:35.544
that old 275?

25:35.708 --> 25:36.926
Honest to God, I really would.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.684
Anyway, we must now find out

25:38.731 --> 25:39.868
how fast this car

25:39.992 --> 25:41.234
goes round our track.

25:41.281 --> 25:43.929
Of course, that means handing it over to our tame racing driver.

25:44.907 --> 25:45.951
Some say

25:46.679 --> 25:48.128
that he gets terrible eczema

25:48.325 --> 25:49.336
on his helmet...

25:51.496 --> 25:53.755
... and that if he'd been the video ref

25:53.851 --> 25:55.522
in the World Cup rugby final

25:55.582 --> 25:59.157
he would have seen that of course it was a try, you blind Australian halfwit!

26:00.340 --> 26:01.420
All we know is,

26:01.463 --> 26:02.758
he's called the Stig!

26:04.129 --> 26:05.192
And he's off!

26:05.224 --> 26:06.295
Lots of smoke there,

26:06.347 --> 26:07.461
mostly from the tortured clutch

26:07.521 --> 26:09.107
as Stig gives it the beans

26:09.313 --> 26:10.718
in the secret Launch mode!

26:11.198 --> 26:12.030
First corner.

26:12.078 --> 26:13.286
He turns in hard.

26:14.023 --> 26:14.975
The tyres squeal...

26:15.035 --> 26:16.552
more roll than you might expect, actually...

26:16.629 --> 26:17.255
Well... that's...

26:17.801 --> 26:18.769
That is a lot!

26:19.267 --> 26:21.230
<i>'A sixth-sensory person</i>

26:21.290 --> 26:22.910
<i>interacts with the world,</i>

26:22.944 --> 26:24.530
<i>witnessing energy</i>

26:24.579 --> 26:26.027
<i>in a detached mode.</i>

26:27.047 --> 26:29.042
Magneto-rheological dampers

26:29.071 --> 26:30.688
sport traction control off,

26:30.722 --> 26:32.342
stereo sadly on, though.

26:32.402 --> 26:34.825
Tail just flicking out there, coming into the Hammerhead...

26:34.860 --> 26:36.000
Very hard on the brakes.

26:36.394 --> 26:37.766
Almost beat the ABS there.

26:39.737 --> 26:41.370
That's a big drift!

26:41.816 --> 26:44.894
This may be a V12 Pentium Processor, but God, it can dance!

26:44.928 --> 26:46.522
<i>Use that energy to be more giving,</i>

26:46.574 --> 26:48.211
<i>more supportive and more effective.</i>

26:49.134 --> 26:52.083
Right, now the full fury of that Enzo engine.

26:52.958 --> 26:54.072
Here it goes.

26:54.124 --> 26:55.324
Powers through the Follow-through,

26:55.358 --> 26:56.427
through the tyres.

26:56.693 --> 26:57.470
That is quick,

26:57.513 --> 26:58.628
but is it supercar quick

26:58.679 --> 27:01.988
or will the 599 softer GT side slow it down?

27:02.749 --> 27:04.594
Coming up to Gambon now.

27:05.029 --> 27:06.632
Super tidy through there.

27:07.018 --> 27:08.389
And across the line!

27:12.599 --> 27:13.818
Got to remember

27:13.876 --> 27:16.513
that we're talking here about a car that weighs

27:16.794 --> 27:18.025
nearly two tons,

27:18.142 --> 27:19.138
leather seats,

27:19.208 --> 27:20.193
air conditioning,

27:20.286 --> 27:22.052
big boot... and it did it

27:22.134 --> 27:23.037
faster

27:23.271 --> 27:24.853
than a Ford GT.

27:25.755 --> 27:26.951
1 minute 22.2

27:27.044 --> 27:29.236
That is truly staggering.

27:30.033 --> 27:31.193
But now we must move on,

27:31.436 --> 27:32.233
because

27:32.303 --> 27:33.510
it's time to put a star

27:33.580 --> 27:35.104
in our reasonably priced car.

27:35.174 --> 27:36.276
My guest tonight holds

27:36.452 --> 27:37.998
an amazing record.

27:38.127 --> 27:39.768
He has been seen in the flesh

27:39.822 --> 27:41.216
by more people than

27:41.333 --> 27:44.157
anyone else in the history of humankind.

27:44.802 --> 27:47.029
And that is because he is a member of a band

27:47.146 --> 27:48.278
called the Rolling Stones.

27:48.348 --> 27:50.118
Ladies and gentlemen, Ronnie Wood!

27:54.237 --> 27:55.206
Can't believe this.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.217
Hello, mate.

27:56.654 --> 27:57.606
Staggering!

27:57.655 --> 27:58.084
All right?

27:58.426 --> 27:59.541
I'm very well, how are you?

27:59.927 --> 28:00.655
Good.

28:01.938 --> 28:02.744
I guess, um...

28:05.427 --> 28:08.170
I guess you must be unnerved by a crowd as big as this.

28:08.373 --> 28:09.230
I know, I know...

28:09.265 --> 28:10.259
500 people here.

28:10.293 --> 28:11.434
It's nice to be intimate.

28:12.548 --> 28:14.254
It's not intimate, this is huge!

28:14.297 --> 28:15.308
Is this true...?

28:15.784 --> 28:17.010
Cos we were working out the other day...

28:17.045 --> 28:18.776
What do you get on an average tour these days?

28:18.819 --> 28:20.011
How many people come?

28:20.799 --> 28:22.025
Oh, God... Um...

28:22.428 --> 28:23.439
Many millions.

28:23.491 --> 28:24.670
I reckon...

28:25.270 --> 28:26.547
more people than the Pope.

28:28.964 --> 28:30.242
The Pope is nothing...

28:30.581 --> 28:32.776
Can't see the Pope singing Satisfaction,

28:32.819 --> 28:34.010
let's be honest.

28:34.122 --> 28:36.462
Now, I've got to get straight to business here.

28:37.573 --> 28:39.656
You look at the Stones, you've all got good hair.

28:40.076 --> 28:41.534
How can you have known that

28:41.705 --> 28:42.982
when you all got together?

28:44.960 --> 28:46.803
Well, none of us wanted to be in Fleetwood Mac.

28:49.958 --> 28:51.878
Hair's an important thing... why is... you know...

28:52.101 --> 28:53.275
Must be the gypsy blood!

28:53.369 --> 28:55.122
I know you're the first member of your family

28:55.163 --> 28:56.432
to be born on dry land, is that right?

28:56.555 --> 28:57.769
Yeah, me and my two brothers,

28:57.920 --> 29:00.825
all the rest of the family right back down to the 1700s

29:00.894 --> 29:03.733
that I traced so far were all born on the water.

29:04.103 --> 29:05.015
You all were on...

29:05.042 --> 29:06.695
- ... canals rather than...?
- Yeah, on the canals.

29:06.818 --> 29:08.544
I didn't realise that gipsies were born...

29:08.578 --> 29:09.956
I thought they were born in caravans, not in...

29:11.081 --> 29:11.952
narrowboats.

29:11.993 --> 29:13.760
I've got a caravan for the dry land bit.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.296
You're kidding! You've still got a caravan?

29:15.481 --> 29:16.400
Yeah, I got a few...

29:16.516 --> 29:17.915
one in the front and one in the back garden.

29:17.947 --> 29:19.202
Would you like us to destroy them?

29:20.539 --> 29:21.732
No, I can do that myself.

29:22.096 --> 29:24.990
Honestly, we would be even better than you at destroying them.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.189
Now, you've got a book out.

29:27.353 --> 29:28.783
- Which is called...
- Da-dah!

29:28.818 --> 29:29.943
You've brought one with you...

29:30.048 --> 29:31.103
It's called Ronnie.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.552
The one thing, having read it,

29:32.599 --> 29:35.259
that fascinates me is, how are you still alive?

29:37.099 --> 29:38.177
Good question.

29:38.294 --> 29:39.782
How did you do it?

29:39.876 --> 29:42.091
Every single thing that's ever happened in your life

29:42.262 --> 29:43.609
would have killed anybody else.

29:43.680 --> 29:44.570
The drugs,

29:44.793 --> 29:46.785
the fights even in the early days, when you were with

29:47.031 --> 29:47.910
Jeff Beck...

29:47.957 --> 29:49.973
Yeah, the escapes, the escapes

29:50.043 --> 29:51.813
oh, my God, from some motorway café.

29:52.687 --> 29:54.632
- What, the Blue Boar days?
- Yeah.

29:54.843 --> 29:56.810
Cos all the bands used to meet there after doing gigs,

29:56.930 --> 29:57.995
at the Blue Boar, on the M1.

29:58.101 --> 29:59.073
We would ahm...

29:59.261 --> 30:01.281
be sitting there at the shank of the evening

30:01.331 --> 30:03.768
and outside you could see the gangs gathering, you know,

30:03.827 --> 30:05.713
and they're going, "We'll have that lot, in the end"

30:05.772 --> 30:07.295
- The mods and rockers gangs?
- Yeah!

30:07.372 --> 30:09.774
And we didn't know which one was gonna attack us,

30:10.637 --> 30:12.617
We had to pretend to be on both sides,

30:12.688 --> 30:15.524
and also get out of there and make our escape so...

30:15.957 --> 30:17.996
we had to jump into the car through the window,

30:18.265 --> 30:19.379
into the back...

30:19.472 --> 30:21.887
The full Dukes of Hazzard through the window?

30:22.015 --> 30:25.273
Yeah, just the window was luckily wound down because they'd come at you with...

30:27.101 --> 30:29.276
with baseball bats and whatever other sticks

30:29.335 --> 30:32.417
and nails and stuff they could get their hands on.

30:32.510 --> 30:35.311
And Jeff would get behind the driver's seat, and...

30:35.346 --> 30:37.955
one against the petrol pump, another one against the wall...

30:38.001 --> 30:39.337
Boom, boom, get out!

30:39.654 --> 30:41.869
So Jeff Beck's not only an amazing guitarist,

30:41.927 --> 30:43.392
but he's also a getaway driver?

30:43.458 --> 30:45.192
He is. Oh yeah.

30:45.275 --> 30:47.346
This is one of the things I noticed in your friend list,

30:47.455 --> 30:50.000
in your book, it's looking at your friends,

30:50.455 --> 30:53.121
you've met people like John Belushi, Hendrix...

30:53.456 --> 30:56.014
All those people... they're not exactly a Methodist Bible group.

30:57.675 --> 31:01.141
Which brings us round to our dearly departed friend, Keith Moon,

31:02.012 --> 31:03.258
God bless him.

31:03.847 --> 31:06.780
Driving up the steps, straight through the plate glass window and saying,

31:06.861 --> 31:08.816
"Could I have my room key, please?"

31:09.647 --> 31:10.919
You saw him do that?

31:11.039 --> 31:12.258
Yeah, and he pitched a tent

31:12.379 --> 31:15.486
in the lobby of the Beverley Wiltshire in Hollywood

31:15.633 --> 31:17.187
because they wouldn't let him in,

31:17.334 --> 31:19.384
so he said, "I'm staying anyway."

31:19.598 --> 31:20.857
Oh, look, that's proper...

31:20.925 --> 31:23.398
There's none of that... you wouldn't see Daniel Bedingfield

31:23.468 --> 31:24.478
doing that.

31:25.510 --> 31:27.186
What's your record for staying up?

31:28.064 --> 31:29.975
6 days, 6 nights

31:30.139 --> 31:31.744
With a concert after everyone.

31:32.084 --> 31:34.475
We would play Madison Square Garden,

31:34.803 --> 31:36.194
Keith and I would say,

31:36.569 --> 31:38.151
"Well, we might as well make a laugh of it..."

31:38.268 --> 31:40.834
Let's go down to the studio with Eric Clapton,

31:40.905 --> 31:43.131
Let's go down to Electric Lady", so we'd do that

31:43.471 --> 31:44.537
every night...

31:44.608 --> 31:46.795
We'd say, "There's no point in going to bed now,

31:47.310 --> 31:49.021
we'll be on in a few more hours".

31:49.080 --> 31:51.142
So that went on second day, third day,...

31:51.342 --> 31:53.931
Fourth day I said, "Keith, I'm going to rest now..."

31:54.224 --> 31:56.154
"Nobody sleeps while I'm awake..."

31:56.611 --> 31:59.353
So we did the extra two days and, before we knew it...

32:00.126 --> 32:01.861
We had a nice two days' kip.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.368
That's just fantastic...

32:04.427 --> 32:06.872
And then there was also, not only the danger, obviously,

32:06.930 --> 32:08.231
of touring and staying up,...

32:08.278 --> 32:10.000
Keith Richards obviously was...

32:10.247 --> 32:12.262
armed a lot of the time as well...

32:12.579 --> 32:15.340
Yeah, before the good old days of the terrorists,

32:15.492 --> 32:18.563
at the airports, you used to be able to carry a piece on with you

32:18.633 --> 32:20.156
Did Keith ever shoot anybody

32:20.567 --> 32:21.199
or anything?

32:21.234 --> 32:22.156
He'd shoot

32:22.589 --> 32:24.968
between somebody's legs that he was mad at in his room once,

32:25.015 --> 32:26.105
And it went...

32:26.292 --> 32:28.073
through the ceiling and disturbed

32:28.179 --> 32:29.573
an old people's card game

32:29.679 --> 32:30.968
in the room below.

32:32.452 --> 32:34.092
Why do we all have the jobs we have?

32:34.151 --> 32:35.475
Why aren't we all in bands?

32:35.592 --> 32:37.397
Didn't he shoot somebody's guitar once?

32:37.889 --> 32:39.882
Yeah, which turned out to be his own guitar!

32:41.952 --> 32:43.686
He thought it was Mick's, and he was mad at Mick

32:43.733 --> 32:45.209
and said, I'll shoot his guitar...

32:45.350 --> 32:46.698
So he got a pillow,

32:47.694 --> 32:49.416
And I said to a roadie,

32:50.876 --> 32:52.517
"Oh, what we're gonna tell Mick?"

32:52.622 --> 32:54.556
He said, "Don't worry, he borrowed it from Keith anyway..."

32:58.001 --> 33:00.000
Reading the book I was thinking, OK, you lived through that,

33:00.071 --> 33:02.590
you lived through the fights, you lived through the 60s and the mods and the rockers,

33:02.637 --> 33:04.582
you lived through the drugs, you lived through all the drink.

33:04.981 --> 33:05.953
But when you...

33:06.024 --> 33:07.676
taped over your wedding video,

33:08.426 --> 33:09.935
Why did you have to bring that out for?

33:10.978 --> 33:12.220
Nearly an early divorce.

33:12.372 --> 33:14.364
Did you actually kill him for that?

33:15.384 --> 33:16.321
You nearly did.

33:16.403 --> 33:17.774
It's only the last bit of it,

33:17.821 --> 33:19.567
you know in the old days with videos,

33:19.633 --> 33:21.566
you'd hit STOP and it would go back about...

33:21.660 --> 33:22.467
Yeah...

33:22.587 --> 33:23.723
... a foot, or something...

33:23.898 --> 33:24.695
So...

33:24.941 --> 33:26.863
We're getting into Joe singing...

33:26.922 --> 33:28.422
"And then he kissed me" at the...

33:28.488 --> 33:29.718
wedding reception.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.968
and then suddenly, ???

33:36.838 --> 33:38.415
Ok, now, there's one thing that...

33:39.019 --> 33:41.820
I think we all have in our heads, really about the Stones

33:41.940 --> 33:44.956
is that you have absolutely no idea about how the world works any more...

33:45.076 --> 33:46.995
You just live in this incredible...

33:47.581 --> 33:48.636
... separate existance.

33:48.756 --> 33:51.085
Is that the case or are you in touch with how the world goes?

33:51.205 --> 33:52.198
Well, it is...

33:52.318 --> 33:54.111
difficult being on tour and...

33:54.580 --> 33:56.490
you know, going to the office with a...

33:56.610 --> 33:57.908
police escort and...

33:58.028 --> 33:59.619
private planes, and...

33:59.739 --> 34:01.236
It's pretty hard to adjust,

34:01.591 --> 34:02.305
coming off.

34:03.114 --> 34:05.094
I just find it so very difficult

34:05.214 --> 34:07.157
to imagine a Rolling Stone... Can't imagine Mick

34:07.277 --> 34:09.969
driving a car. I can't imagine him knowing what the levers where for.

34:10.895 --> 34:12.536
I can't see Charlie driving, either,

34:12.656 --> 34:13.731
Has he got a driving license?

34:13.851 --> 34:14.293
No.

34:14.516 --> 34:15.254
Oh, he hasn't.

34:15.476 --> 34:16.543
So he's got no cars.

34:16.663 --> 34:17.844
He owns...

34:17.964 --> 34:19.274
a wonderful...

34:19.393 --> 34:20.072
Lagonda.

34:20.193 --> 34:22.792
He's got a collection of rare old cars

34:23.109 --> 34:24.187
and he likes to

34:24.306 --> 34:25.628
hear the sound of the engine,

34:26.179 --> 34:27.525
but not rev it up.

34:27.646 --> 34:29.205
Don't like to rev it up.

34:29.324 --> 34:29.908
Or...

34:30.027 --> 34:31.103
go anywhere in it.

34:31.223 --> 34:33.094
He gets suits made

34:33.634 --> 34:34.547
of the same...

34:34.668 --> 34:36.822
design as the car, you know, it's sort of...

34:36.942 --> 34:38.603
maroon and grey,

34:38.724 --> 34:40.397
with stripes and something, and...

34:40.516 --> 34:41.275
sits in it,

34:42.225 --> 34:43.690
He's an eccentric.

34:44.522 --> 34:45.940
I love the idea of being him,

34:46.060 --> 34:47.699
You're just so...

34:47.819 --> 34:48.730
I do have,

34:48.850 --> 34:50.393
In Ireland I do have my

34:50.514 --> 34:51.717
old 6.3 Mercedes

34:51.838 --> 34:52.574
An old one?

34:52.694 --> 34:54.425
Yeah, 97, yeah.

34:54.545 --> 34:56.101
Huge, really good looking.

34:56.406 --> 34:56.956
beautiful?

34:57.076 --> 34:58.327
With hydraulic

34:58.447 --> 35:00.320
- seats and boot-lid and everything?
- Yeah.

35:00.440 --> 35:02.605
That's a lovely car, what else have you got?

35:03.613 --> 35:04.714
I've got an old

35:05.160 --> 35:06.016
Chevrolet

35:06.136 --> 35:07.035
2-seater

35:07.155 --> 35:08.313
with dickie seats.

35:08.433 --> 35:10.539
and wooden spoke wheels.

35:10.785 --> 35:11.770
from the 1920s.

35:11.890 --> 35:13.737
Though it really didn't set you up in any way

35:13.857 --> 35:15.846
for the Chevrolet that we provided you with

35:15.858 --> 35:16.913
today to do the lap.

35:17.170 --> 35:18.213
Is that what it was?

35:18.333 --> 35:19.983
Chevrolet Lacetti!

35:20.103 --> 35:20.967
Oh!

35:21.087 --> 35:22.397
How was it out on the...

35:22.517 --> 35:23.438
on the circuit?

35:23.558 --> 35:24.786
It was fantastic, by the

35:24.906 --> 35:26.684
time I did my last lap, I thought,

35:26.804 --> 35:27.927
"I could get into this!"

35:28.047 --> 35:29.016
Who'd like to see

35:29.136 --> 35:29.837
the lap?

35:30.425 --> 35:31.679
Play the tape, here we go!

35:34.072 --> 35:35.583
Hello, come on, let's go!

35:36.263 --> 35:37.892
Ronnie Wood in our Chevrolet.

35:38.012 --> 35:40.060
We gotta think lap times here.

35:40.295 --> 35:41.607
The slowest one ever!

35:43.536 --> 35:44.989
Let's have a look. Is that slow?

35:45.109 --> 35:46.290
No, it is not.

35:46.410 --> 35:47.485
Better than Jools Holland.

35:49.782 --> 35:50.556
That was nice.

35:51.235 --> 35:51.950
Brake.

35:52.958 --> 35:54.699
You need to for that corner.

35:55.261 --> 35:56.726
That's looking good as well.

35:57.558 --> 35:58.531
Come on!

35:58.651 --> 36:00.054
You old crate!

36:01.906 --> 36:03.594
You do need to brake again there.

36:05.082 --> 36:06.980
Liking the braking while understeering,

36:07.100 --> 36:08.222
nice and tidy.

36:08.551 --> 36:09.828
Go on, Ronnie, go on,

36:09.948 --> 36:10.812
go on!

36:10.932 --> 36:13.077
Going into this one nice and fast.

36:15.362 --> 36:16.592
I'm loving this.

36:18.256 --> 36:19.124
This one...

36:19.244 --> 36:20.542
even faster.

36:21.422 --> 36:23.297
Bloody hell, that is quick!

36:24.106 --> 36:26.040
I'll hit this nice too.

36:26.508 --> 36:28.793
I really didn't think you'd be able to do this.

36:28.913 --> 36:30.926
I thought you'd just get lost and not know your name.

36:31.316 --> 36:33.097
It's the last corner again...

36:33.718 --> 36:36.191
and there he is across the line, everybody!

36:38.792 --> 36:40.081
I didn't spin off!

36:40.491 --> 36:41.581
I'm staggered!

36:43.163 --> 36:44.769
I am genuinely amazed at that.

36:44.889 --> 36:45.812
I'm still shaken.

36:45.932 --> 36:47.066
But you liked it?

36:47.186 --> 36:48.448
Yeah, adrenaline.

36:48.568 --> 36:49.058
That's great.

36:49.178 --> 36:51.228
So, where do you think

36:51.556 --> 36:52.435
you've come

36:52.763 --> 36:53.607
on our

36:53.935 --> 36:55.130
lap times board?

36:55.529 --> 36:56.664
Even if I came last,

36:56.784 --> 36:58.552
I just enjoyed the hell out of it.

36:59.112 --> 37:00.799
Sweet man, but you didn't come last.

37:00.919 --> 37:01.807
Not even close.

37:01.927 --> 37:02.744
You did it

37:02.864 --> 37:04.033
in 1 minute...

37:06.869 --> 37:08.920
49.4 seconds.

37:09.347 --> 37:10.249
You, mate,

37:11.222 --> 37:11.949
are right...

37:14.433 --> 37:16.027
Quicker than Jools.

37:19.645 --> 37:21.180
Where's Helen Mirren's name on there?

37:21.300 --> 37:22.539
Helen Mirren is there,

37:22.879 --> 37:24.133
1.52.8.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.262
Well, that has just been the best fun having you on,

37:27.382 --> 37:28.750
honestly. Ladies and gentlemen,

37:28.870 --> 37:30.227
Ronnie Wood!

37:37.567 --> 37:38.563
Now,

37:39.090 --> 37:40.086
over the years,

37:40.206 --> 37:42.606
technology has done a great deal to help old people.

37:42.726 --> 37:44.223
It's given them the Stannah Stairlift,

37:44.343 --> 37:45.667
the electric tin opener

37:45.787 --> 37:47.331
and the rubberised undersheet.

37:47.753 --> 37:50.531
But there's never been anything to help old people park...

37:50.777 --> 37:51.937
until now!

37:52.057 --> 37:55.221
'Cause this Lexus LS600 can park itself.

37:55.619 --> 37:57.448
Now, here's basically how it works.

37:57.568 --> 37:59.229
At the back of the car, there are sensors

37:59.349 --> 38:01.584
in the bumper that know where its extremes are.

38:01.704 --> 38:03.134
There's a tiny little camera here

38:03.254 --> 38:06.333
that looks behind and when Hammond presses a little button on the screen,

38:06.453 --> 38:08.677
it will reverse and steer itself

38:08.934 --> 38:10.118
into that spot.

38:10.238 --> 38:11.747
Yup, it's that easy.

38:11.867 --> 38:13.447
I just engage reverse gear,

38:13.693 --> 38:15.040
I can see the cameras here,

38:15.160 --> 38:16.740
I press some buttons and stuff

38:16.860 --> 38:17.958
and then it parks!

38:18.078 --> 38:19.810
Here goes! This is gonna go well.

38:20.243 --> 38:22.388
Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt

38:22.508 --> 38:23.970
but this is the instruction book

38:24.090 --> 38:25.352
that I have here, ok?

38:25.472 --> 38:26.829
for this command system.

38:26.949 --> 38:28.165
All of that...

38:28.598 --> 38:29.852
is for the park assist.

38:29.972 --> 38:31.168
You think you can do it without reading it?

38:32.036 --> 38:32.633
Well...

38:33.395 --> 38:35.434
All right, go on, see if I care.

38:35.554 --> 38:37.098
Go on then, go on then.

38:37.452 --> 38:39.573
I don't do anything, I just take my foot off the brake, yeah?

38:39.693 --> 38:42.081
Yeah, you take your foot off the brake, and then it goes.

38:42.201 --> 38:45.421
I'm not doing anything, I'm not doing anything, I'm not doing anything! It's just the car!

38:45.751 --> 38:46.675
I'm not!

38:46.795 --> 38:47.801
Oh, bugger!

38:48.809 --> 38:49.430
No!

38:49.550 --> 38:50.075
Stop!

38:50.848 --> 38:51.786
Stop!

38:56.004 --> 38:57.785
You've hit the cool wall!

38:57.905 --> 39:00.000
Well, it's new technology...

39:00.120 --> 39:02.027
Has anyone got any reading glasses?

39:03.270 --> 39:04.594
I can't read this damn book.

39:04.714 --> 39:06.129
Thanks, I promise I'll pay you back.

39:08.368 --> 39:09.188
Right.

39:09.645 --> 39:11.989
I've got a green light and I've hit OK.

39:12.633 --> 39:14.093
And, er, right.

39:14.504 --> 39:17.199
If I put my foot on the brake, it slows it down.

39:20.797 --> 39:21.968
Yes, yes!

39:22.707 --> 39:24.170
No! No! No, no, no, no, no!

39:26.608 --> 39:28.084
The Cool Wall again!

39:29.127 --> 39:31.049
I think we set the radar wrong.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.983
We've got to read the book!

39:34.146 --> 39:36.524
<i>"A equals B, is less than C..."</i>

39:36.644 --> 39:39.255
<i>"(A and B are equally far away)..."</i>

39:39.724 --> 39:41.962
How can old people understand this?

39:42.994 --> 39:43.662
Jeremy?

39:43.782 --> 39:44.283
What?

39:44.403 --> 39:44.986
James?

39:45.106 --> 39:45.536
Yes.

39:45.656 --> 39:46.332
Both of you,

39:46.333 --> 39:48.126
is the green square important?

39:48.246 --> 39:49.017
BOTH: Yes!

39:49.019 --> 39:50.907
- What does that green square mean?
- It's where you go!

39:51.027 --> 39:53.204
Oh, I put that in the cool wall!

39:55.571 --> 39:56.895
Ah, I've moved it, I've moved it!

39:57.015 --> 39:58.477
It's in the right place now.

39:58.597 --> 39:59.509
So that's where I go.

39:59.629 --> 40:00.540
- Here I go!
- He's going, he's going...

40:00.660 --> 40:01.407
I've got it,

40:01.981 --> 40:03.434
I'm not touching anything.

40:03.997 --> 40:05.228
Please, turn. Please, God, turn!

40:05.239 --> 40:06.236
Turn it the other way!

40:06.259 --> 40:08.075
- No, I can't touch it!
- Turn it the other way!

40:08.195 --> 40:09.540
- The car has to do it.
- It's doing it!

40:09.660 --> 40:10.466
The car has to do it.

40:14.124 --> 40:15.437
That's nearly in!

40:15.557 --> 40:16.538
That's parked!

40:18.155 --> 40:19.444
That is nearly there.

40:19.564 --> 40:23.101
Ladies and gentlemen, give the car that nearly did it a round of applause.

40:27.577 --> 40:29.850
And the really tremendous thing about this is:

40:29.970 --> 40:32.452
this car is £83,000.

40:32.572 --> 40:35.420
The old age pension at the moment is £87.30,

40:35.724 --> 40:37.482
which means if you save all your money,

40:37.763 --> 40:39.006
do without food and warmth,

40:39.126 --> 40:40.493
you will be able to buy one of these

40:40.494 --> 40:42.217
in just 18 years.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.932
Who says we don't do sensible consumer advice on this show?

40:47.947 --> 40:48.849
And there's more.

40:48.969 --> 40:51.407
Because as the country becomes more and more crowded,

40:51.527 --> 40:54.055
and the environmentalists become more and more noisy,

40:54.313 --> 40:56.528
it makes more and more sense than ever

40:56.648 --> 40:58.438
to have a small car.

40:58.688 --> 41:00.106
There are lots to choose from.

41:00.226 --> 41:01.149
I've got a selection here:

41:01.173 --> 41:02.755
Volkswagen Polo, Suzuki Swift

41:02.875 --> 41:03.950
quite nice, actually...

41:04.454 --> 41:06.024
and the Citroen C1.

41:06.144 --> 41:07.126
The trouble is

41:07.454 --> 41:09.446
none of these cars are really small.

41:09.566 --> 41:10.876
They are in fact...

41:11.392 --> 41:12.505
MASSIVE.

41:14.896 --> 41:16.056
40 years ago,

41:16.176 --> 41:18.833
car makers could sell you something much smaller:

41:19.408 --> 41:21.201
the original Mini, for example,

41:21.321 --> 41:22.736
or the bubble car.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.763
But even these aren't small.

41:25.113 --> 41:25.863
Not really.

41:26.414 --> 41:27.727
Not compared...

41:28.020 --> 41:29.285
to this:

41:29.941 --> 41:32.109
the Peel P50.

41:33.983 --> 41:34.621
That

41:35.045 --> 41:36.732
is 54 inches long

41:36.852 --> 41:38.195
and 41 inches wide.

41:38.315 --> 41:41.171
It's listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the smallest

41:41.291 --> 41:43.398
production car ever.

41:43.518 --> 41:45.554
And what I'm sure you're expecting me to do now

41:45.840 --> 41:47.668
is introduce Richard Hammond.

41:48.758 --> 41:50.786
But what I'm ACTUALLY going to do

41:51.547 --> 41:52.649
is drive it to work.

41:54.758 --> 41:56.575
All, erm, 6'5" of me.

42:02.950 --> 42:04.989
No, that's not gonna work. I'll have to... Hang on.

42:08.095 --> 42:11.540
Leg first and then... Yes!

42:15.337 --> 42:17.763
Built on the Isle of Man in the early '60s,

42:17.883 --> 42:19.133
the P50 was said to be

42:19.253 --> 42:20.963
almost cheaper than walking.

42:21.455 --> 42:23.177
It cost £198

42:23.297 --> 42:25.369
and did 100 miles to the gallon.

42:26.414 --> 42:27.949
It sounds perfect then,

42:28.289 --> 42:29.649
for the roads of today.

42:32.391 --> 42:34.700
Of course, there are one or two drawbacks.

42:34.820 --> 42:37.301
I can't imagine, for instance, that it's terribly safe,

42:37.559 --> 42:40.102
not when your knees are the crumple zones.

42:41.673 --> 42:43.407
And nor is it very...

42:43.689 --> 42:44.415
fast.

42:45.130 --> 42:46.126
What I've got

42:46.138 --> 42:47.907
down here by my right knee,

42:48.027 --> 42:49.501
in the cabin,

42:49.621 --> 42:51.434
making an awful lot of noise

42:51.435 --> 42:53.427
and generating quite a bit of heat

42:53.708 --> 42:56.273
is the 49cc engine

42:56.393 --> 42:57.763
from a moped.

42:58.501 --> 43:01.033
Top speed rather depends on how big you are

43:01.279 --> 43:02.215
and, erm...

43:03.306 --> 43:05.615
actually how much you had for breakfast.

43:06.517 --> 43:08.709
Realistically, even the skinniest,

43:08.943 --> 43:11.240
shortest chap with the whitest of teeth

43:11.591 --> 43:13.959
will struggle to get past... 35?

43:19.338 --> 43:21.576
There's something else I've just thought of as well.

43:22.642 --> 43:24.728
I have to pay congestion charge in this

43:24.848 --> 43:26.287
in this part of London,

43:26.908 --> 43:28.607
but the camera crew in the

43:28.727 --> 43:30.564
Lexus 4x4 don't,

43:30.684 --> 43:31.888
because it's a "hybrid".

43:32.008 --> 43:33.553
How fair is that?

43:34.162 --> 43:36.541
It's not like I'm creating any pollution at all.

43:38.732 --> 43:42.177
The Peel, then, is not only a handy way of getting TO work,

43:42.851 --> 43:44.960
but it's also pretty practical

43:45.080 --> 43:46.507
when you get there.

43:53.063 --> 43:55.981
Normally, the BBC make you

43:57.445 --> 43:59.484
moor up in an underground car park,

43:59.604 --> 44:01.082
but the bays are only big enough for

44:01.202 --> 44:02.488
ethnic peace bicycles and

44:02.608 --> 44:04.470
fairtrade G-Wizzes.

44:05.548 --> 44:09.064
Because this is smaller than an ethnic peace bicycle,

44:09.184 --> 44:11.349
I don't have to worry about parking

44:12.161 --> 44:13.004
at all.

44:18.934 --> 44:21.301
The great thing about a car this small

44:21.421 --> 44:22.754
is that it's very light,

44:23.211 --> 44:25.016
which means that when you get to work,

44:25.136 --> 44:26.493
you just pick it up and

44:26.727 --> 44:27.946
carry it inside.

44:37.023 --> 44:37.702
Morning!

44:37.822 --> 44:39.085
In the Top Gear office,

44:39.205 --> 44:42.299
the team were keen to know more about the P50.

44:42.419 --> 44:43.775
I give you the future,

44:43.895 --> 44:45.439
young men and women!

44:45.721 --> 44:46.693
The Peel P50.

44:46.813 --> 44:48.662
I think it's 4.5 horsepower.

44:48.942 --> 44:50.442
You know those Little Tykes cars

44:51.181 --> 44:52.142
that all kids have got?

44:52.262 --> 44:54.356
That's exactly the same - one door.

44:55.212 --> 44:56.278
I have never seen

44:56.398 --> 44:57.474
the Top Gear team

44:57.594 --> 44:59.489
so enthusiastic about any car.

44:59.609 --> 45:02.806
"Lads, I put a Koenigsegg down in the car park... Oh, right."

45:02.926 --> 45:04.821
"I've got a new Ferrari there."

45:04.941 --> 45:06.019
"Not interested." This...

45:08.961 --> 45:11.492
Even John Humphrys dropped by for a look.

45:12.195 --> 45:12.816
Hammond...

45:13.074 --> 45:13.437
No...

45:14.129 --> 45:15.359
Well, can't you just clean them?

45:17.527 --> 45:19.180
Really, £4,000 to whiten them?

45:19.766 --> 45:20.633
4,000 quid?

45:21.582 --> 45:22.180
You've white...?

45:23.668 --> 45:25.437
No, well, I'll stick with the yellow ones. OK.

45:25.557 --> 45:26.059
Take care!

45:26.434 --> 45:26.773
Bye.

45:28.285 --> 45:29.609
Who's got the car?

45:34.408 --> 45:36.049
That's fantastic!

45:36.169 --> 45:37.514
Who's stolen the car?

45:38.990 --> 45:41.088
God, the power under this bonnet!

45:41.208 --> 45:43.080
It's impressive!

45:47.347 --> 45:49.574
Ah, Clarkson, you've met your match here with me.

45:52.562 --> 45:54.531
Please don't just steal our things.

45:54.800 --> 45:55.433
D'you mind?

45:55.553 --> 45:57.144
Thanks very much. Jolly nice of you.

46:01.268 --> 46:04.691
Soon, I was summoned to an important BBC meeting.

46:04.914 --> 46:06.752
Most of the people going would be walking,

46:06.872 --> 46:08.791
but I was running late, and decided

46:08.911 --> 46:10.117
to use the car.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.496
'Doors closing.'

46:24.333 --> 46:25.739
'Fourth floor.'

46:26.923 --> 46:29.560
Fiona Bruce is standing here, the newsreader.

46:35.963 --> 46:37.135
'Ground floor.'

46:37.255 --> 46:39.022
Sorry, Fiona, could you give me a push?

46:39.549 --> 46:40.545
A push out?

46:40.665 --> 46:43.076
Please, cos it's got no reverse gear, so...

46:46.337 --> 46:47.099
Thank you!

46:47.219 --> 46:48.400
Shall I leave you right there?

46:48.657 --> 46:50.181
This is fine, thanks.

46:51.880 --> 46:52.945
She has got

46:53.065 --> 46:54.353
quite a nice bottom.

46:56.603 --> 46:57.950
I said that out loud, didn't I?

47:01.091 --> 47:02.600
After a short drive,

47:02.720 --> 47:05.368
I arrived at BBC Television Centre.

47:09.540 --> 47:10.617
Unfortunately though,

47:10.737 --> 47:14.251
this is the most complicated building in the world.

47:29.510 --> 47:31.700
I've worked at the BBC for 20 years

47:31.820 --> 47:33.799
and I still don't know where I'm going.

47:34.138 --> 47:35.743
Tomorrow's World was cancelled,

47:35.863 --> 47:38.861
not because the programme wasn't interesting any more, but simply because

47:39.623 --> 47:41.662
Judith Hann was lost in here.

47:41.932 --> 47:44.428
Remember John Noakes, Peter Purves from Blue Peter?

47:44.548 --> 47:46.092
They're in here somewhere, lost...

47:49.361 --> 47:51.051
Hello, can anyone help?

47:53.090 --> 47:54.097
Thanks!

47:54.777 --> 47:56.359
Which department's this?

47:59.309 --> 48:00.927
I'm really lost now.

48:03.434 --> 48:05.015
"...Talks with Government ministers about...

48:05.135 --> 48:07.429
... how to handle the number of claims that have resulted...

48:07.549 --> 48:08.741
from last month's floods...

48:08.861 --> 48:12.762
... The total bill is estimated at about £1.5b...

48:12.882 --> 48:14.299
... Mark Simpson is here..."

48:14.322 --> 48:15.060
Sorry!

48:15.180 --> 48:16.522
Sorry, everyone! Sorry!

48:17.237 --> 48:18.794
Eventually, though, I made it

48:18.914 --> 48:21.186
to the top-level BBC seminar.

48:23.049 --> 48:25.830
I believe we've already made significant inroads

48:25.950 --> 48:28.397
into the implementation of an open and inclusive

48:28.517 --> 48:29.337
policy

48:29.457 --> 48:30.883
for the ethnocentrically

48:31.003 --> 48:33.415
homogenous objectives of this department.

48:33.652 --> 48:35.410
But I'd like to say that climate change

48:35.530 --> 48:37.637
is the biggest threat EVER

48:37.757 --> 48:39.547
to face the peoples of this world.

48:39.887 --> 48:42.254
And minimising our carbon footprint

48:42.605 --> 48:44.293
through the functional usage

48:44.413 --> 48:46.414
is a key responsibility of

48:46.534 --> 48:49.226
anyone who uses a photocopier.

48:49.719 --> 48:52.390
I hope that in this session we can discuss

48:52.510 --> 48:53.164
and address...

48:53.284 --> 48:55.367
Sadly the meeting went on for so long,

48:55.487 --> 48:57.195
that there was no time left in the day

48:57.315 --> 48:59.281
for any programme-making.

48:59.597 --> 49:01.250
..for the ethnocentrically...

49:01.370 --> 49:02.960
So I headed home.

49:04.686 --> 49:06.255
I really do think that today

49:06.375 --> 49:07.850
I have seen the future.

49:07.970 --> 49:08.823
And it comes

49:09.175 --> 49:10.921
from 1963.

49:11.601 --> 49:13.345
This Peel P50 really is

49:13.465 --> 49:14.894
absolutely brilliant.

49:15.014 --> 49:17.155
If it had a reverse gear,

49:17.601 --> 49:19.382
I would describe it as the absolute

49:19.502 --> 49:21.347
ultimate, really, of...

49:21.467 --> 49:22.906
personal mobility.

49:25.226 --> 49:26.925
That's Dermot Murnaghan! Oi!

49:27.535 --> 49:28.121
It is!

49:28.449 --> 49:29.527
Murnaghan!

49:29.647 --> 49:30.734
Murnaghan!

49:30.854 --> 49:32.750
Oh! Thanks!

49:33.875 --> 49:35.902
Thanks for that! Sorry...

49:45.107 --> 49:47.205
We really have a very big problem

49:47.755 --> 49:49.654
at the BBC with newsreaders.

49:49.774 --> 49:52.383
Just the other day we were in the canteen, Paxman came through

49:52.503 --> 49:53.943
on a Harley Davidson.

49:55.075 --> 49:56.094
They're out of control!

49:56.214 --> 49:58.707
Is this the best car we've ever had on Top Gear?

49:58.968 --> 49:59.542
Yes!

49:59.776 --> 50:01.417
Honestly, I think it's...

50:01.537 --> 50:02.952
genuinely astonishing!

50:03.210 --> 50:04.780
But I think I can now go

50:04.900 --> 50:05.776
one better!

50:05.896 --> 50:07.544
Because, ladies and gentlemen,

50:07.848 --> 50:09.055
I'm able to reveal

50:09.175 --> 50:11.352
there is a sports version of this car!

50:12.792 --> 50:14.106
Who'd like to see it?

50:15.111 --> 50:16.022
Here we go!

50:16.142 --> 50:17.571
Look at that!

50:18.500 --> 50:19.383
It's just...

50:19.503 --> 50:19.984
staggering!

50:20.104 --> 50:21.386
It's "The Jetsons"...

50:23.269 --> 50:25.226
I just want one of those. That is...

50:25.346 --> 50:26.562
That would be my perfect

50:26.682 --> 50:27.874
two-car garage.

50:29.573 --> 50:30.698
Yeah... Now,

50:30.818 --> 50:31.683
a year ago,

50:31.803 --> 50:33.338
Jeremy raced James and me

50:33.362 --> 50:34.170
from Italy

50:34.290 --> 50:34.873
to London.

50:35.166 --> 50:37.405
James and I in his ridiculous aeroplane,

50:37.525 --> 50:39.303
and Jeremy in a Bugatti Veyron.

50:39.725 --> 50:40.944
And, annoyingly,

50:41.342 --> 50:41.987
he won.

50:42.455 --> 50:45.654
Then we heard from a bunch of aeroplane enthusiasts

50:45.947 --> 50:47.072
called the RAF.

50:47.494 --> 50:49.381
They said, "Why don't you come up to our place

50:49.501 --> 50:51.230
and we've got a plane "that'll give your car

50:51.350 --> 50:52.603
a run for its money."

50:52.723 --> 50:53.791
And, well...

50:53.911 --> 50:56.451
since I'm the only one who hasn't yet driven the Bugatti Veyron,

50:56.709 --> 50:57.822
I took up the challenge.

51:12.919 --> 51:14.700
Yes, the 1,000 horsepower legend

51:14.712 --> 51:15.778
is back

51:15.898 --> 51:18.028
and, if I'm honest, I'm a bit nervous.

51:19.247 --> 51:20.935
Not because of the car itself,

51:21.055 --> 51:22.247
but because of the burden

51:22.367 --> 51:24.664
that now rests on my shoulders.

51:25.285 --> 51:26.938
When Jeremy drove the Veyron,

51:27.594 --> 51:28.766
all he had to beat

51:28.886 --> 51:31.884
was an incompetent James in a useless little aeroplane.

51:33.759 --> 51:36.654
Then when James went to Germany and maxed it,

51:36.774 --> 51:38.602
the car didn't even break sweat.

51:39.762 --> 51:40.805
But this time,

51:41.192 --> 51:43.911
the Veyron's honour really is at stake

51:44.356 --> 51:45.598
because never before

51:45.868 --> 51:48.347
has it gone up against something like this.

51:52.073 --> 51:53.011
The most modern,

51:53.362 --> 51:55.612
the most hi-tech strike fighter

51:55.732 --> 51:56.718
on the planet.

51:57.140 --> 51:58.875
The Eurofighter Typhoon.

52:03.023 --> 52:03.912
And for once,

52:04.032 --> 52:05.472
when it comes to figures,

52:05.695 --> 52:09.633
the Bugatti really is well and truly top-trumped.

52:10.640 --> 52:14.636
Its twin engines develop 20,000lb of thrust each,

52:15.117 --> 52:18.117
punching the Eurofighter up to 65,000ft

52:18.375 --> 52:19.617
and a top speed

52:19.737 --> 52:22.899
of over 1,500mph.

52:24.727 --> 52:26.385
This machine is the cutting edge

52:26.505 --> 52:27.839
of what a plane can do.

52:32.960 --> 52:34.522
It's actually designed to be

52:34.642 --> 52:36.551
aerodynamically unstable

52:36.671 --> 52:38.431
to make it as agile as possible

52:38.551 --> 52:39.788
in a dogfight.

52:42.753 --> 52:45.554
So it needs 70 computers to keep it in the air,

52:45.823 --> 52:46.913
and if they fail,

52:47.300 --> 52:49.597
it would simply fall out of the sky.

52:51.976 --> 52:53.183
It's a kind of a mix

52:53.303 --> 52:54.648
of science fiction

52:54.768 --> 52:56.054
and brute strength.

52:56.312 --> 52:59.581
These wings, for example, have to be able to take the stresses and strains

52:59.921 --> 53:01.117
of all those extreme,

53:01.237 --> 53:02.371
high-speed manoeuvres.

53:02.842 --> 53:04.846
They might look slim and dainty,

53:05.175 --> 53:06.745
but each one can take the weight

53:06.865 --> 53:08.796
of 35 Volkswagen Golfs.

53:09.874 --> 53:12.414
All in all, a handy bit of kit,

53:12.660 --> 53:13.586
as you'd expect,

53:13.706 --> 53:15.742
at £67m a pop.

53:18.484 --> 53:21.250
Faced with the clear and present danger of the Eurofighter,

53:21.472 --> 53:24.590
the Bugatti Veyron really is the car world's best shot

53:24.710 --> 53:26.054
at clinging to some honour.

53:28.281 --> 53:30.845
And no-one knows what the outcome will be.

53:32.954 --> 53:35.239
In fact, Bugatti's so concerned,

53:35.532 --> 53:37.102
they've sent over not one,

53:37.829 --> 53:39.434
but two Veyrons.

53:39.786 --> 53:41.661
Maybe they're gonna tie them together or something.

53:46.009 --> 53:47.778
The shoot-out will take place here:

53:47.898 --> 53:49.443
on the main runway

53:49.563 --> 53:51.681
at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire.

53:54.447 --> 53:55.349
And here's the challenge:

53:55.469 --> 53:58.127
it's a horizontal versus vertical drag race

53:58.247 --> 53:59.545
over two miles.

53:59.897 --> 54:01.443
Here's the start-finish line

54:01.563 --> 54:03.846
and the car and the plane.

54:04.830 --> 54:07.139
Yeah, It's difficult to get hold of models of a Veyron and a

54:07.162 --> 54:08.229
Eurofighter.

54:08.349 --> 54:10.033
Both start from here, the car will race

54:10.153 --> 54:11.463
down the runway for a mile,

54:11.583 --> 54:13.139
when it reaches the mile marker,

54:13.259 --> 54:14.709
turn, as quickly as possible,

54:14.970 --> 54:16.400
and then race back down,

54:16.520 --> 54:17.677
over the same mile,

54:17.797 --> 54:19.728
to cross the start-finish line here.

54:20.044 --> 54:20.689
Meanwhile,

54:20.911 --> 54:22.095
the plane will set off,

54:22.215 --> 54:24.138
and take off as quickly as possible,

54:24.258 --> 54:25.322
and cover a mile...

54:25.650 --> 54:26.763
vertically.

54:27.033 --> 54:27.853
When it's done the mile,

54:27.973 --> 54:29.669
it turns and swoops

54:29.916 --> 54:31.474
back down the same mile

54:31.594 --> 54:33.364
to cross the start-finish line.

54:33.867 --> 54:37.512
Or to crash into a £1m supercar it didn't expect to see

54:37.805 --> 54:39.340
and YouTube has a field day.

54:39.460 --> 54:41.672
Otherwise, last one to finish is a vegetarian.

54:41.792 --> 54:42.902
Simple as that.

54:45.152 --> 54:48.198
Now, you might think the plane is going to walk it.

54:49.755 --> 54:51.536
But don't be so sure.

54:52.766 --> 54:54.325
The car should have the edge

54:54.445 --> 54:55.438
off the line.

54:55.558 --> 54:59.017
It will do nought to 100 in 5.7 seconds, for God's sake.

55:02.674 --> 55:04.642
And when it gets to these yellow dots,

55:04.762 --> 55:07.537
which mark the mile point where it has to turn around,

55:07.865 --> 55:09.858
the Veyron has another advantage.

55:10.842 --> 55:11.486
Down here,

55:11.606 --> 55:13.771
its awesome brakes should come into play.

55:15.318 --> 55:17.005
And then there's the air brake as well,

55:17.125 --> 55:19.478
which on its own generates the same stopping power

55:19.598 --> 55:21.341
as you'd get in a normal hatchback.

55:25.738 --> 55:27.461
A straight line is a straight line.

55:27.707 --> 55:29.957
So the car does what it does there.

55:31.329 --> 55:32.935
But up here,

55:33.779 --> 55:34.915
I've got to brake

55:35.220 --> 55:36.673
as late as possible,

55:36.793 --> 55:39.289
and lose as little time as possible making the turn,

55:39.781 --> 55:41.094
before the return mile.

55:41.656 --> 55:42.734
so I reckon

55:43.027 --> 55:44.094
it'll be won or lost

55:44.375 --> 55:45.898
here at this end.

56:20.307 --> 56:21.607
Traction control off,

56:21.854 --> 56:23.072
gearbox to manual,

56:23.192 --> 56:24.268
launch control,

56:24.388 --> 56:25.674
left foot on brake,

56:25.990 --> 56:28.018
give it the full beans on the throttle...

56:29.318 --> 56:30.057
This is it.

56:31.672 --> 56:33.336
<i>'Stand by one, give me 20 seconds.'</i>

56:37.906 --> 56:39.640
As drag races go, you will agree,

56:40.239 --> 56:41.868
this is quite a good one.

57:01.776 --> 57:02.748
We are away!

57:06.250 --> 57:07.363
We're neck and neck!

57:08.336 --> 57:09.672
I'm getting away!

57:12.206 --> 57:14.207
I can't believe I'm looking in...

57:14.327 --> 57:15.180
Wow!!

57:16.410 --> 57:18.074
I can feel the wash from the jet!

57:19.260 --> 57:20.702
And there it goes!

57:26.854 --> 57:30.019
So I'm fighting for the Germans in a battle against the RAF!

57:34.367 --> 57:36.254
If you're watching thinking, "This is cool"...

57:36.374 --> 57:37.390
It is.

57:39.749 --> 57:43.007
After just 18 seconds I was doing 188mph

57:43.127 --> 57:45.702
and getting ready to brake for the mile turn.

57:48.951 --> 57:50.580
That's as late as I dare.

57:55.289 --> 57:56.555
This is where it's won or lost.

58:06.517 --> 58:07.607
I'm on the return mile now.

58:09.927 --> 58:12.177
This is the best race in history!

58:15.857 --> 58:18.704
If I mess this up, I may as well get a paper out.

58:20.572 --> 58:23.760
I was doing 196mph but was it enough?

58:26.244 --> 58:28.635
I must still be ahead, I can't see the plane.

58:32.947 --> 58:34.412
NO-O-O-O-O!!!

58:35.338 --> 58:36.205
Nooo!

58:43.236 --> 58:45.486
I suspect I may get some abuse for this.

59:09.003 --> 59:10.316
You failed!

59:11.232 --> 59:13.716
You are a vegetarian and you failed

59:13.836 --> 59:15.308
and you're useless.

59:15.577 --> 59:16.152
Yes...

59:16.432 --> 59:18.589
Gotta admit though, it IS quite a car.

59:18.709 --> 59:20.182
Oh, it is staggering, but...

59:20.302 --> 59:21.495
what a plane!

59:21.615 --> 59:23.604
And here is the guy who flew it:

59:23.944 --> 59:25.737
Squadron Leader Jim Walls.

59:31.409 --> 59:32.780
Must have been terrifying.

59:32.900 --> 59:33.799
Well, it was, because...

59:33.919 --> 59:35.035
Not you, him!

59:35.973 --> 59:37.496
Had to wake up that morning, "What am I doing today?"

59:37.616 --> 59:41.469
"Oh, Richard Hammond's coming, he's driving a fast car in a straight line on a runway in the North!"

59:43.078 --> 59:45.855
He's not gonna go, "Can I do nuclear war instead?"

59:46.957 --> 59:48.140
So, well done, mate, fantastic.

59:48.260 --> 59:50.147
Next week we are in Africa,

59:50.267 --> 59:51.237
for a Top Gear special.

59:51.357 --> 59:54.166
The three of us are trying to drive across the spine of the continent

59:54.518 --> 59:57.928
in three ordinary, used, 2WD road cars.

59:58.162 --> 59:59.826
It is worth watching, trust me.

59:59.946 --> 01:00:00.603
See you then,

01:00:00.723 --> 01:00:01.551
Good night!

01:00:02.305 --> 01:00:08.723
