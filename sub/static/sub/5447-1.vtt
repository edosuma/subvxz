02:58.776 --> 03:00.901
There it is.

03:00.986 --> 03:04.280
Pretty much how
I remember it.

03:04.365 --> 03:06.573
I was younger than you
last time I was here, Simon.

03:06.658 --> 03:10.286
Well, it's big.

03:10.371 --> 03:12.829
Yeah, so I can get bigger
pets here, right, Mom?

03:12.914 --> 03:16.041
Sure! Get a cow.
Get a whole flock.

03:16.126 --> 03:17.543
Herd.

03:17.627 --> 03:20.003
That, too. What do
you think, Jared?

03:23.049 --> 03:24.007
Jared?

03:31.099 --> 03:32.891
Okay. Here we go.

03:41.985 --> 03:43.901
Shh!

03:43.986 --> 03:47.238
Shh. It's okay,
Mr. Tibbs. It's okay.

03:47.322 --> 03:51.201
It has
that old people smell.

03:51.285 --> 03:53.452
It's just an observation,
not a judgment.

04:13.306 --> 04:16.934
You're angry about
the move. I get that.

04:17.019 --> 04:20.353
Just what are you expecting
your silent protest will get you?

04:23.984 --> 04:26.192
At least acknowledge this isn't
the way to deal with your anger

04:26.277 --> 04:28.445
the way you said
you were gonna do.

04:29.489 --> 04:31.406
Say yes with your head.

04:31.491 --> 04:32.741
Two blinks.

04:35.245 --> 04:36.245
Nothing.

04:40.792 --> 04:43.834
Mal, you and Simon
take your stuff.

04:43.919 --> 04:46.504
Wait in the foyer while I go
look for the main circuit breaker.

04:46.589 --> 04:47.756
Okay, Mom.

04:49.174 --> 04:50.758
Get out of the car
right now.

04:50.843 --> 04:52.635
You're not my mother,
Mallory.

04:52.719 --> 04:54.804
No, I'm worse, because Mom
doesn't believe in hitting.

04:54.889 --> 04:56.430
Ow! Come here,
you little...

04:56.515 --> 04:59.684
And he's out of the car!
Thank you!

04:59.768 --> 05:02.520
Stop it! I'm not gonna let
you keep acting like a jerk!

05:02.604 --> 05:04.480
I'll do whatever I want.
- No, you won't!

05:04.565 --> 05:06.774
Mom needs this to work,
so cut it out!

05:06.859 --> 05:07.859
Simon, get her!

05:07.942 --> 05:10.652
I'm a pacifist.

05:10.737 --> 05:12.362
You're so annoying. You
think you know everything!

05:12.447 --> 05:13.739
Well, I know
stuff you don't.

05:13.824 --> 05:15.115
Like what?

05:16.160 --> 05:17.117
Nothing.

05:19.871 --> 05:21.538
Thanks for
having my back, bro.

05:21.623 --> 05:22.747
I don't do conflict.

06:02.121 --> 06:03.120
What are you doing?

06:03.205 --> 06:04.497
Unpacking.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.582
Why? I told you
it was only temporary.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.876
Dad's coming tomorrow, and he's
gonna take us back with him.

06:08.961 --> 06:10.711
I know.
But what about Mom?

06:10.796 --> 06:12.629
She can have Mallory.

06:12.714 --> 06:14.381
Come on, Simon,
we can't stay here.

06:14.466 --> 06:16.174
Look at this place.

06:16.259 --> 06:17.802
It's the house
that time forgot.

06:17.886 --> 06:19.637
And it's got that...

06:19.721 --> 06:21.263
Old people smell,
I know.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.889
And what's this?

06:25.018 --> 06:27.812
Salt. There's salt
on the window.

06:27.895 --> 06:29.813
I know. It's on all the windows.

06:29.898 --> 06:32.356
Yeah, and that's not weird.

06:32.441 --> 06:35.610
I'm guessing
she put it there.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.029
Is that the nut bag
and her husband?

06:37.113 --> 06:38.989
No.

06:39.074 --> 06:42.075
That's Arthur Spiderwick, you
know, our great-great-uncle.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.035
The little girl's
the nut bag.

06:44.120 --> 06:48.290
I mean, Aunt Lucinda,
his daughter.

06:48.373 --> 06:51.960
She's the one who lived here
before they took her away to the...

06:52.045 --> 06:53.168
To the...

06:53.253 --> 06:54.420
To the nut house.

06:55.381 --> 06:56.965
Right.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.049
And why'd she
get taken there?

06:59.134 --> 07:01.427
Because she said
her father was abducted.

07:01.512 --> 07:02.261
By?

07:04.764 --> 07:06.223
By faeries.

07:06.975 --> 07:08.684
Exactly.

07:08.769 --> 07:12.479
Our crazy aunt stayed here her
whole life and never left, ever!

07:12.564 --> 07:14.982
That's not gonna
happen to me, or you.

07:15.943 --> 07:17.484
End of discussion.

07:31.124 --> 07:32.707
Has anybody
seen my keys?

07:32.792 --> 07:34.083
I know I left
them right here.

07:34.168 --> 07:35.043
Nope.

07:38.340 --> 07:41.466
I guess Aunt Lucinda liked
honey with her oatmeal, huh?

07:41.551 --> 07:43.051
And tomato sauce.

07:43.136 --> 07:44.677
Hmm?

07:47.932 --> 07:48.639
Wow.

07:50.351 --> 07:52.018
Where is my
fencing medal, Jared?

07:52.103 --> 07:53.228
Hanging on your bed?

07:53.312 --> 07:54.770
It's not there anymore.

07:54.855 --> 07:56.147
Well, find the bed
and you'll find your medal.

07:56.232 --> 07:57.357
I'm not talking
about the bed...

07:57.442 --> 07:58.692
You know what?

07:58.775 --> 08:00.318
I'm not acknowledging
your existence

08:00.403 --> 08:01.819
until you bring
my medal back.

08:01.904 --> 08:03.570
Promise?

08:03.655 --> 08:05.698
Well, actually, you'd have to
acknowledge his existence

08:05.783 --> 08:07.450
in order to receive
the medal from him.

08:07.534 --> 08:09.243
Thanks, Spock. You're the
pride of the Federation.

08:09.328 --> 08:11.077
Jared, give it back.

08:11.162 --> 08:12.371
I didn't take
the stupid medal!

08:12.456 --> 08:13.831
You're such a liar!
Conflict.

08:13.915 --> 08:14.790
Shut up, Simon!
Shut up, Simon!

08:14.875 --> 08:15.875
Hey!

08:18.545 --> 08:20.296
We're not
gonna do this.

08:21.965 --> 08:25.717
New town. New house. New job.

08:25.802 --> 08:28.053
This is our new life.

08:28.137 --> 08:31.181
Let's not fall
into old ruts, okay?

08:31.266 --> 08:34.601
I know this house isn't
perfect, but we can make it work,

08:35.727 --> 08:36.977
if we want
to make it work.

08:37.063 --> 08:38.188
All right?

08:38.273 --> 08:39.105
All right, Mom.

08:42.985 --> 08:43.860
Shut up!

09:03.339 --> 09:04.797
Hi.

09:04.882 --> 09:05.923
Dad.
- Dad.

09:07.801 --> 09:09.968
Yeah, we made it.

09:10.053 --> 09:11.387
What's that noise
in the background?

09:11.471 --> 09:12.721
You know, scratch that.

09:12.806 --> 09:13.722
I don't want to know.

09:13.807 --> 09:15.474
Just because I don't.

09:15.558 --> 09:16.808
I'm gonna go
look for my medal.

09:16.893 --> 09:18.436
I'll help you.

09:20.522 --> 09:21.479
What?

09:24.275 --> 09:25.484
Um...

09:27.153 --> 09:28.654
It's your dad.

09:32.825 --> 09:34.159
<i>Hi, Dad.
- Hey, buddy.</i>

09:34.244 --> 09:35.576
<i>How's the Addams
Family mansion?</i>

09:35.661 --> 09:37.413
Oh, the house?
Yeah, it's great,

09:37.496 --> 09:39.664
if you like big creepy houses
in the middle of nowhere.

09:39.749 --> 09:42.709
<i>Now, come on.
- Seriously. There's nothing here.</i>

09:42.794 --> 09:43.960
You'll see.

09:44.045 --> 09:45.670
<i>Yeah, well, listen...</i>

09:45.755 --> 09:47.339
<i>You're still coming tomorrow, right?
- Um...</i>

09:47.424 --> 09:49.382
<i>Yeah, maybe.
I'm gonna try.</i>

09:49.467 --> 09:51.467
<i>Why maybe?
- Look, don't worry. I'm coming.</i>

09:51.552 --> 09:53.177
<i>There's something
we need to talk about.</i>

09:53.262 --> 09:55.096
<i>But tomorrow might
not work out, okay?</i>

09:55.181 --> 09:56.597
Yeah, I understand.

09:56.682 --> 09:58.225
<i>Okay, good.</i>

09:58.308 --> 09:59.892
<i>You'll try though, right?
- Absolutely.</i>

09:59.977 --> 10:02.228
<i>But I'll see you soon,
though. Definitely.</i>

10:02.312 --> 10:03.396
Okay.

10:04.231 --> 10:05.314
<i>See you, Son.</i>

10:05.399 --> 10:05.939
Bye, Dad.

10:13.407 --> 10:15.074
What did you
say to him?

10:21.831 --> 10:24.750
Can't you at least pretend you
want him to come and see us?

11:05.206 --> 11:07.083
Jared Grace,
put that broom down!

11:07.168 --> 11:09.376
There's something in the wall!
- Now!

11:12.005 --> 11:15.966
You said you were gonna stop
hitting things when you got angry!

11:16.051 --> 11:18.135
I know I said I was
gonna stop yelling.

11:18.220 --> 11:19.720
Please, please,
don't do this.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.058
We'll clean it up, Mom.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.435
You go to bed.
You need to sleep.

11:33.151 --> 11:33.983
Nice move,
pinhead.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.611
Shut up.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.237
Something's in there,
moving.

11:37.322 --> 11:38.781
Probably
a red squirrel.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.698
Very common
in this region.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.158
Or it could just be a rat.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.662
Uh-uh!

11:45.747 --> 11:48.707
We don't need any
more holes in the wall!

11:59.051 --> 12:00.926
Great.
I'll get blamed for that.

12:02.596 --> 12:04.889
Check it out.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.766
This is one of those things
they use to send food upstairs.

12:07.851 --> 12:09.017
What are they called?

12:09.102 --> 12:10.227
Dumbwaiter.

12:12.313 --> 12:14.065
Hey,
those are Mom's keys.

12:16.943 --> 12:18.944
And my medal!

12:19.028 --> 12:21.906
What? You still
think I took it.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.824
Yeah, Mal,
you busted me.

12:23.908 --> 12:26.368
I took your medal, hid it
here and re-plastered the wall.

12:26.453 --> 12:27.994
I don't know
how you did it.

12:28.079 --> 12:30.580
I just know you did it,
because you always do it.

12:30.665 --> 12:32.499
And now you're
gonna clean it up.

12:32.584 --> 12:34.293
You told Mom we
were gonna clean it.

12:34.377 --> 12:36.169
We means you.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.759
Simon, don't you want to know
where this thing goes?

12:42.844 --> 12:44.135
Not really.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.156
Simon!

15:14.241 --> 15:15.575
Simon, wake up!

15:15.658 --> 15:17.410
Ow!

15:17.495 --> 15:21.622
I went up. It's a room,
a secret room, upstairs.

15:21.707 --> 15:24.708
There's a desk and a chest,
and I found this book!

15:24.793 --> 15:25.918
Something was in there!

15:26.002 --> 15:27.252
A red squirrel?

15:27.337 --> 15:28.962
No, not a squirrel.

15:29.047 --> 15:30.006
Unless squirrels
can spell.

15:31.674 --> 15:33.467
It wrote in the dust
on the desk,

15:33.552 --> 15:35.260
"Jared Grace,
leave this place."

15:36.429 --> 15:37.888
Wow.

15:37.973 --> 15:40.556
That's really...impossible.

15:41.893 --> 15:43.601
It's late.

15:43.686 --> 15:45.145
Just go to sleep.

16:01.287 --> 16:03.788
"Do not dare to
read this book,

16:03.872 --> 16:06.207
"for if you take
one fateful look,

16:06.292 --> 16:08.542
"you barter at
your life's expense

16:08.627 --> 16:10.461
"and face
a deadly consequence."

16:44.204 --> 16:45.078
What the...

16:46.206 --> 16:47.205
Hmm.

16:52.628 --> 16:54.003
How did you guys
get out?

17:30.206 --> 17:31.707
<i>Dear reader,</i>

17:31.791 --> 17:33.500
<i>what you now
hold in your hands</i>

17:33.585 --> 17:35.293
<i>is the culmination
of a life's work.</i>

17:35.378 --> 17:37.380
<i>And you will
soon see, as I have,</i>

17:37.463 --> 17:40.173
<i>that there are fantastical
creatures living among us,</i>

17:40.258 --> 17:42.592
<i>hidden through
mimicry and magic.</i>

17:48.599 --> 17:50.850
<i>This book will give you
the tools and techniques</i>

17:50.935 --> 17:54.229
<i>needed to lift the veil
and see the unseen.</i>

17:54.313 --> 17:56.230
<i>Once you have this sight,</i>

17:56.315 --> 17:59.359
<i>you will never see things
the same way again.</i>

17:59.443 --> 18:00.985
<i>But be forewarned,</i>

18:01.070 --> 18:02.654
<i>the secrets you
are about to learn</i>

18:02.738 --> 18:04.864
<i>have been kept
hidden for ages,</i>

18:04.949 --> 18:08.367
<i>secrets that many of this realm
would prefer to stay hidden.</i>

18:08.452 --> 18:11.370
<i>The creatures you will meet
are truly a sight to behold,</i>

18:11.455 --> 18:13.831
<i>and most of them do not
like being observed.</i>

18:13.916 --> 18:17.543
<i>But, over time,
I have garnered their trust.</i>

18:17.627 --> 18:20.838
<i>Some, I am quite happy to
report, I now call friend.</i>

18:23.342 --> 18:26.843
<i>But a rare few are, quite
frankly, to be feared.</i>

18:26.928 --> 18:28.846
<i>The darker forces
of this realm</i>

18:28.931 --> 18:30.681
<i>all live in service
of one creature,</i>

18:30.766 --> 18:32.766
<i>the ogre, Mulgarath.</i>

18:32.851 --> 18:34.977
<i>The secrets herein
are powerful,</i>

18:35.062 --> 18:36.979
<i>more powerful than
even I was aware.</i>

18:37.063 --> 18:39.732
<i>Never before has knowledge
of the fantastical realm</i>

18:39.815 --> 18:41.650
<i>been assembled in one tome.</i>

18:41.734 --> 18:43.694
<i>And so I implore you,
dear reader,</i>

18:43.778 --> 18:45.904
<i>to use this
information wisely,</i>

18:45.989 --> 18:47.989
<i>for the ogre, Mulgarath,
seeks this knowledge</i>

18:48.074 --> 18:50.450
<i>with relentless persistence.</i>

18:50.535 --> 18:53.577
<i>If he were to obtain the
information in these pages,</i>

18:53.662 --> 18:57.124
<i>I can assure you his intentions
would be of the vilest sort.</i>

18:57.207 --> 18:59.167
<i>He assumes many forms,</i>

18:59.251 --> 19:01.711
<i>and so you must constantly
be on guard.</i>

19:01.796 --> 19:04.297
<i>I deeply fear that
the more I learn,</i>

19:04.381 --> 19:07.550
<i>the more I place everyone

19:10.346 --> 19:12.429
<i>So, reader, beware.</i>

19:12.514 --> 19:14.057
<i>I beseech you, beware.</i>

19:20.522 --> 19:22.064
Mom!

19:22.149 --> 19:23.399
What's going on?

19:23.483 --> 19:24.733
Mom!
Mom, please, help!

19:24.818 --> 19:26.193
What happened to you?

19:26.278 --> 19:27.820
Hold still.

19:27.904 --> 19:29.864
Please, Mom,
just cut it! Cut it!

19:29.948 --> 19:31.073
Ow!
- Okay, calm down.

19:31.158 --> 19:32.574
Mom, please!

19:32.659 --> 19:34.618
Just cut
me out! Cut it out!

19:34.703 --> 19:36.078
Please, just get a scissors!
I don't care!

19:36.163 --> 19:37.746
What happened?

19:37.831 --> 19:39.331
He ruined my hair!
Get him out!

19:39.415 --> 19:41.709
Jared, you've gone
way too far this time.

19:41.792 --> 19:44.795
Mom, please! Please!
- What? I didn't do this!

19:44.880 --> 19:46.380
I've been sitting
in a footlocker

19:46.464 --> 19:47.506
for the last two hours,
reading!

19:47.882 --> 19:48.798
Yeah, right!

19:48.883 --> 19:51.092
Ask Simon.

19:51.177 --> 19:52.636
Well, he was
in a footlocker.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.803
Just cut me out!

19:53.888 --> 19:55.430
Field guide.

19:55.515 --> 19:57.098
Mom, just cut it!

20:02.146 --> 20:02.771
Ow!

20:08.485 --> 20:10.362
I'm not enjoying this.

20:10.445 --> 20:12.655
I told you, I'll help you
catch a woodchuck or something.

20:12.739 --> 20:14.657
I need the practice.
Now, come on.

20:15.993 --> 20:16.993
Simon!

20:17.160 --> 20:18.369
Ow!

20:18.454 --> 20:20.621
That's not fair.
He distracted me.

20:20.706 --> 20:21.956
What does
"appease" mean?

20:22.040 --> 20:23.708
"Appease."

20:23.793 --> 20:27.294
You know, placate, pacify, assuage.

20:27.379 --> 20:28.337
In English.

20:28.421 --> 20:29.296
To make nice.

20:30.882 --> 20:32.716
Is that what you
came out here to do?

20:32.801 --> 20:34.801
Well, apology
not accepted.

20:34.886 --> 20:36.511
I'm not apologizing
'cause I didn't do it!

20:37.180 --> 20:38.722
This did.

20:38.807 --> 20:41.642
A brownie is living in the
house and wants us to leave.

20:41.726 --> 20:43.602
Wow. That's incredible.

20:44.228 --> 20:46.062
You can read!

20:46.147 --> 20:48.106
I'm telling you, something
is in that house with us,

20:48.191 --> 20:49.524
and Arthur Spiderwick
knew about it,

20:49.609 --> 20:51.568
and that's why he
wrote this guide!

20:51.653 --> 20:53.278
I'm a little lost.

20:53.363 --> 20:54.738
Who needs
to be appeased?

20:54.822 --> 20:57.240
The brownie?
- No, a boggart.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.117
So there's a brownie
and a boggart?

20:59.202 --> 21:01.536
A brownie turns into a
boggart when it's angry,

21:01.620 --> 21:04.080
and it got angry when
Mallory destroyed his nest.

21:04.165 --> 21:06.415
It likes honey.

21:06.500 --> 21:07.750
That's why all
the honey's there.

21:07.835 --> 21:09.294
Really?

21:09.378 --> 21:10.920
Don't listen to him, Simon.

21:11.005 --> 21:12.630
Come on, let's go eat.

22:18.654 --> 22:19.696
Hello!

22:22.533 --> 22:23.699
Hello?

22:27.287 --> 22:29.455
Sorry I wrecked your home,
but I made you a new one.

22:32.959 --> 22:34.626
And I got you some honey.

22:37.214 --> 22:38.464
I read you liked it.

22:40.050 --> 22:41.508
Hope you do.

22:41.593 --> 22:43.635
Hope it, you know,
appeases you.

22:45.930 --> 22:46.972
Uh...

22:47.891 --> 22:50.141
I'll be over here.

22:50.226 --> 22:52.477
I'm really hoping
you actually exist.

23:31.141 --> 23:32.266
Hello?

23:52.829 --> 23:55.038
Oh! My, my, my.

23:55.123 --> 23:59.793
That is just, mmm, tasty,
tasty, delicious honey.

24:02.172 --> 24:04.422
So good!
So yummy, yummy, yummy!

24:13.474 --> 24:16.184
Wait! No!
I won't hurt you!

24:16.269 --> 24:18.645
Here, here,
have some more honey!

24:18.729 --> 24:20.562
I shouldn't, I shouldn't,
I really shouldn't.

24:20.647 --> 24:22.649
I mean, if you insist.

24:24.067 --> 24:27.611
Oh, my, my, my!
That is good!

24:27.696 --> 24:29.863
Where are you?
Why can't I see you?

24:29.948 --> 24:31.616
You don't see us,
but now you do.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.451
But only if we want you to.

24:33.534 --> 24:35.828
We? You mean
all the magical creatures

24:35.912 --> 24:37.121
Arthur Spiderwick
wrote about.

24:37.206 --> 24:39.623
The book! Oh, my gosh!

24:39.708 --> 24:41.750
I'm sorry, master,
I've failed!

24:41.834 --> 24:44.128
Failed, failed, failed!

24:44.212 --> 24:47.464
Your instructions were
simple, "Protect the book."

24:47.549 --> 24:50.092
And I did it, I hid it,
I bound it and I wound it.

24:50.177 --> 24:52.553
I did my best,
locked it in the chest!

24:52.636 --> 24:56.348
But you looked and looked
and found the book!

24:56.433 --> 24:59.393
And from the chest,
the thing was stolen!

24:59.478 --> 25:01.602
You foolish boy!

25:01.687 --> 25:03.689
Idiot! Are you blind?

25:03.772 --> 25:05.481
I put a note
right on the cover!

25:05.566 --> 25:07.400
Can't you read?

25:07.485 --> 25:08.694
Why do I write notes when no
one's gonna read the notes?

25:08.777 --> 25:10.528
I'm sorry. Here!
More honey!

25:10.612 --> 25:12.863
No! I'm not falling for that!

25:12.948 --> 25:14.616
Mmm! Mmm!

25:16.368 --> 25:18.118
Oh, that is so good.

25:19.747 --> 25:21.706
And they say I've
got anger issues.

25:21.791 --> 25:23.958
"Protect the book.
Don't let it get took!"

25:24.043 --> 25:25.334
Right, you had
to protect the book.

25:25.419 --> 25:26.919
Who told you
to protect it?

25:27.004 --> 25:27.920
Uh...

25:30.507 --> 25:32.174
Wait! What did I say?

25:32.259 --> 25:33.675
Protect the book,
protect the book.

25:33.760 --> 25:35.594
It wasn't complicated.

25:35.679 --> 25:36.804
I just had to protect
the book. That's all.

25:39.933 --> 25:41.600
Arthur Spiderwick.

25:41.685 --> 25:43.519
So he wrote it
and asked you to protect it.

25:43.604 --> 25:45.520
I said, "Master,
we must destroy it!"

25:45.605 --> 25:47.940
He said, "We must
protect the book.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.941
"Keep it in the circle,
safe from the ogre."

25:50.026 --> 25:52.945
Ogre? Do you mean Mulgarath?

25:53.029 --> 25:56.615
All the years protecting it
now ruined by a little twit!

25:56.700 --> 25:58.116
Circle,
circle, little jerkle.

25:58.201 --> 25:59.367
Little jerkle
broke the circle!

25:59.452 --> 26:01.161
Whoa! Stop! What circle?

26:01.246 --> 26:02.787
Okay.

26:02.872 --> 26:04.288
Uh...

26:12.298 --> 26:14.173
Look. Here, here.

26:14.258 --> 26:17.635
Wait, I read about that,
the protective circle.

26:17.719 --> 26:19.762
So it protects the house
to protect the book.

26:19.847 --> 26:21.889
Safe in the circle,
safe in the circle, safe in the circle.

26:21.974 --> 26:23.308
Safe from who?

26:23.391 --> 26:24.475
Them!

26:24.560 --> 26:26.018
What? Who's them?

26:26.103 --> 26:27.269
I don't see anything.

26:27.354 --> 26:29.646
Tibbsy, come here, boy!

26:29.731 --> 26:32.107
Breakfast time!
Mr. Tibbs?

26:32.192 --> 26:34.276
All right, what did
you do with Simon's cat?

26:34.361 --> 26:35.444
They're not here for the cat.

26:35.529 --> 26:36.529
They want the book!

26:40.450 --> 26:42.410
What is that?
What's out there?

26:42.493 --> 26:45.203
It's goblins!
Goblins are here.

26:45.288 --> 26:47.790
And all because
you took the book out there

26:47.875 --> 26:50.042
and practically waved it in
their faces, you little twerp!

26:50.126 --> 26:51.709
Simon!

26:51.794 --> 26:53.921
Go ahead! Now look
at the mess you made!

26:54.004 --> 26:56.089
Simon! They're taking him
away. What's happening?

26:56.174 --> 26:57.966
The Stone! The Stone!

26:58.051 --> 26:59.509
Look through the Stone!

27:04.849 --> 27:06.265
What the hell?

27:06.350 --> 27:08.601
No! No!

27:08.686 --> 27:09.853
The book stays
or we all die!

27:09.938 --> 27:11.395
I need it! Let go!

27:11.480 --> 27:13.606
It must stay in the circle!
In the circle!

27:13.941 --> 27:14.858
Mom!

27:15.693 --> 27:16.359
Mom!

27:17.736 --> 27:19.654
Mom! Where's Mom?

27:19.739 --> 27:21.656
She went to work, okay?
I'm in charge.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.242
Hey, where are you going?

27:25.327 --> 27:26.536
Psycho.

27:31.333 --> 27:32.792
Help me!

27:32.876 --> 27:35.252
What are you doing? Help!

27:39.424 --> 27:40.216
Help!

28:05.491 --> 28:06.950
Give me, give me.

28:09.871 --> 28:11.287
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Give me a leg!

28:11.497 --> 28:13.247
Hey, give me!

28:13.332 --> 28:15.792
Give me a leg! A leg!

28:17.378 --> 28:19.587
That's not a leg!

28:19.672 --> 28:21.672
This is a leg!
Imbeciles.

28:24.468 --> 28:25.301
Oh, my God.

28:27.137 --> 28:27.971
Simon.

28:35.312 --> 28:36.312
Don't move.

28:36.397 --> 28:39.314
Slowly lift your foot.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.619
Wait, wait,
don't go out there.

28:51.702 --> 28:53.120
They'll see you. Unless...

28:53.205 --> 28:54.914
Wait, are you with them
or with me?

28:54.997 --> 28:56.957
Whose side are you on?
State your side!

28:57.041 --> 28:58.750
Yours. Your side.

28:58.835 --> 29:01.043
Then we must shake
on our alliance.

29:02.422 --> 29:03.838
What? It's good.

29:05.383 --> 29:08.384
Who are you?
I am Hogsqueal.

29:08.469 --> 29:12.097
And I am here on a mission to
destroy the ogre, Mulgarath,

29:12.181 --> 29:13.848
who killed my family!

29:13.933 --> 29:15.349
Can you help me
save my brother?

29:15.434 --> 29:16.893
Please?

29:16.978 --> 29:18.894
Yeah! Sure!

29:18.979 --> 29:22.023
I was gonna suggest that right
after you let me out of this cage.

29:22.108 --> 29:22.982
So, come on! Free me!

29:23.067 --> 29:24.358
Okay, okay.

29:24.443 --> 29:26.694
Get it open.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.

29:26.779 --> 29:29.321
Now get behind me
and keep your mouth shut.

29:29.406 --> 29:31.031
Okay, here's our plan.

29:31.116 --> 29:33.534
I will find a safe
position over there

29:33.619 --> 29:35.786
and create a distraction
with my stick.

29:35.871 --> 29:37.662
Then you leap out
with your knife

29:37.747 --> 29:39.581
and finish
the beast yourself.

29:39.666 --> 29:41.500
I like that plan. That's
a good plan. I'm smart.

29:41.585 --> 29:43.419
What beast?

29:43.504 --> 29:45.796
The ogre, of course!
Mulgarath!

29:45.881 --> 29:47.131
I just want to
save my brother.

29:47.215 --> 29:49.132
Again with the brother?

29:49.217 --> 29:52.427
Okay, fine. If we kill them,
saving him will be much easier.

29:52.512 --> 29:54.221
Trust me.
Now drop that stone.

29:54.306 --> 29:56.014
You'll need both hands
to choke a goblin.

29:56.099 --> 29:57.974
But how do I see without...

29:59.268 --> 30:02.228
Nailed him!

30:02.313 --> 30:06.983
I have given you the Sight, a
gift only a hobgoblin can bestow.

30:07.068 --> 30:08.402
Oh, gross!

30:08.485 --> 30:10.445
You're welcome.
Now, let's go.

30:20.831 --> 30:22.499
Simon!
- Jared.

30:22.582 --> 30:23.875
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

30:23.959 --> 30:25.084
Shh!

30:25.169 --> 30:26.669
Jared, what's happening?

30:26.754 --> 30:27.837
Get me out of here.

30:27.921 --> 30:29.255
Just hang on.

30:30.341 --> 30:32.425
I'm gonna cut you out.

30:32.510 --> 30:33.926
Jared!
- Get back.

30:34.011 --> 30:35.470
Hide.

30:35.553 --> 30:36.887
Jared!

30:38.182 --> 30:40.098
Mulgarath!

30:40.183 --> 30:42.434
Mulgarath!

30:42.519 --> 30:44.603
Mulgarath!

30:44.688 --> 30:46.563
Mulgarath!

30:46.648 --> 30:48.107
Mulgarath!

30:48.192 --> 30:49.817
What are they doing?

30:49.902 --> 30:51.359
Summoning Mulgarath.
Get ready.

30:51.444 --> 30:55.447
Mulgarath!
Mulgarath! Mulgarath!

31:24.435 --> 31:27.103
That's Mulgarath?

31:27.187 --> 31:28.979
That's the ogre
you're all freaked out about?

31:29.064 --> 31:30.273
That old man?

31:30.357 --> 31:32.901
Don't be fooled
by what you think you see.

31:32.984 --> 31:34.860
That's just what he wants.

31:39.824 --> 31:42.159
I beg your forgiveness.

31:42.244 --> 31:47.414
I asked my friends here to invite
you to a nice little meeting.

31:47.499 --> 31:51.084
Then they got
a bit overzealous.

31:52.463 --> 31:54.337
That's a goblin for you.

31:55.715 --> 31:56.799
My apologies.

31:58.926 --> 32:00.510
What do you want with me?

32:00.595 --> 32:02.678
It's not what
I want with you.

32:02.763 --> 32:05.181
It's what I want from you.

32:05.266 --> 32:07.726
Arthur Spiderwick's
field guide.

32:07.811 --> 32:11.146
I know you found it.

32:11.231 --> 32:14.566
That's right, you can simply
walk back the way you came.

32:15.859 --> 32:18.027
Just give me the book.

32:18.112 --> 32:19.278
I don't have it.

32:20.698 --> 32:22.157
I don't. Look.

32:22.825 --> 32:24.075
Search him!

32:26.912 --> 32:29.539
What? If Mulgarath learns
the secrets in that book,

32:29.623 --> 32:31.749
he could kill us all!

32:31.834 --> 32:32.959
He's weak in his human form.

32:33.043 --> 32:34.168
It's now or never.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.379
Come! Death to the ogre!

32:36.463 --> 32:37.630
Bird!

32:37.714 --> 32:40.049
Delicious! Come back here!

32:40.134 --> 32:41.675
I'll be back! Kill him
if you get a chance!

32:41.760 --> 32:43.552
Remember the plan!

32:43.637 --> 32:45.179
Move!

32:45.264 --> 32:47.640
Pockets.
Search the pockets.

32:47.724 --> 32:50.851
The pockets! No, these!

32:50.936 --> 32:53.728
These are pockets, idiot!

32:53.813 --> 32:55.522
Master, this is
all we found.

33:04.241 --> 33:05.907
Do they have the book?

33:08.787 --> 33:10.078
No.

33:10.163 --> 33:11.538
But I know
where it is.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.707
I'll go get it and
give it to you. I swear.

33:15.710 --> 33:19.003
I'm placing my trust in you.

33:19.088 --> 33:21.214
If you give me the book,

33:21.299 --> 33:24.259
your life will go on
as if nothing ever happened.

33:25.469 --> 33:28.596
However, if you fail,

33:28.681 --> 33:33.685
I'm afraid I'll have to find
somebody else to get my book for me.

33:36.021 --> 33:37.813
Go. Go on.

33:39.150 --> 33:40.691
Run along.

33:40.776 --> 33:41.483
Go.

33:45.072 --> 33:51.284
Mulgarath!
Mulgarath! Mulgarath!

33:58.334 --> 34:01.128
You failed me, Redcap!

34:01.213 --> 34:03.880
There are two human boys
with the same faces.

34:03.965 --> 34:05.799
The Jared and the not Jared.

34:05.884 --> 34:07.926
We took the wrong one.

34:08.010 --> 34:11.762
Then find the Jared,
get the book and kill them!

34:11.847 --> 34:13.599
Kill them all!

34:13.681 --> 34:14.724
Move out!

34:28.739 --> 34:30.322
Stupid!

34:30.407 --> 34:31.949
Stupid!

34:32.034 --> 34:33.576
Those things
were gonna kill me

34:33.661 --> 34:35.161
over your stupid, stupid book!
- Shh!

34:35.246 --> 34:37.121
They're right over there.
- I can't take this.

34:37.206 --> 34:38.955
Let's just get to the house
and give it to them.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.458
Hey, it's not
at the house.

34:40.542 --> 34:41.875
It's right here
in my backpack.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.502
What? Then let's
just give it to them.

34:43.587 --> 34:45.212
No, they'll just
kill us anyway!

34:45.297 --> 34:47.255
Well, let's just...

34:47.340 --> 34:49.049
Give it!
- Stop!

34:49.134 --> 34:50.134
Give it!

34:53.513 --> 34:55.931
Book!

34:56.014 --> 34:57.391
Get them! Go! Go! Go!
- Come on!

35:02.730 --> 35:03.939
After them!

35:08.195 --> 35:10.903
Get them! Get them!
Rip them apart!

35:10.988 --> 35:13.156
But not the book!
Don't hurt the book!

35:20.998 --> 35:22.082
Jared! Jared! Over here!

35:22.166 --> 35:23.708
Help me! Help me!

35:23.793 --> 35:24.709
Come on!

35:26.170 --> 35:27.670
Calm down!

35:27.755 --> 35:29.589
Keep them away!
Keep them away!

35:29.673 --> 35:31.090
It's okay. There's a protective
circle around the house.

35:31.175 --> 35:32.299
We're safe inside it.

35:32.384 --> 35:33.468
There you are.

35:33.551 --> 35:36.011
You know,
Mom left me in charge,

35:36.096 --> 35:37.106
so you can't just run
off without telling me.

35:37.107 --> 35:37.304
- Get her.

35:37.389 --> 35:38.723
Mallory, this way, now!

35:39.266 --> 35:41.643
Now! Now!

35:41.726 --> 35:43.227
What? Don't yell at me.
Mal, come on! Come on!

35:43.311 --> 35:45.145
Run to the front door, fast!

35:45.230 --> 35:47.314
I'm not running anywhere,
and stop throwing rocks at me!

35:47.399 --> 35:49.691
Listen to him! You're
surrounded by goblins!

35:49.776 --> 35:51.527
Get inside
the protective circle!

35:51.611 --> 35:54.196
Oh, God, Simon, he's
got you in on this now?

35:54.281 --> 35:56.156
For the last time,
there's no such thing as...

35:58.952 --> 36:00.869
What's happening?

36:00.953 --> 36:02.203
No, Mallory, they're short.

36:02.288 --> 36:03.913
Aim below your knees.
10 o'clock.

36:04.082 --> 36:05.373
10 o'clock!

36:06.668 --> 36:09.377
Mallory! Mallory!
12 o'clock!

36:09.462 --> 36:11.088
Behind you! Behind you! 6 o'clock!

36:11.172 --> 36:12.672
3 o'clock!
3 o'clock!

36:12.757 --> 36:14.424
Here, look through this!

36:33.110 --> 36:35.111
Come back!
You're safe. You're safe.

36:35.195 --> 36:36.362
You're safe.

36:43.412 --> 36:45.162
Now do you believe me?
Uh-huh.

36:48.417 --> 36:49.542
Mom!

36:53.547 --> 36:54.672
It's gonna be bad!
It's bad!

36:56.465 --> 36:57.842
Oh, God.
No, that's bad.

36:57.925 --> 36:59.718
Mom!
- Jared!

36:59.803 --> 37:00.844
What were those things?

37:00.929 --> 37:02.304
I told you, goblins.

37:02.389 --> 37:03.138
It's okay, Simon.
It's okay.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.641
No, it's not okay!
It's not! It's not!

37:06.726 --> 37:07.934
He's right.
What am I saying?

37:08.019 --> 37:09.144
Of course it isn't!

37:09.229 --> 37:10.770
How many of those things
are out there?

37:10.855 --> 37:12.189
I don't know!
I don't know! Okay?

37:12.273 --> 37:13.690
Sit tight!
I'll be right back!

37:13.775 --> 37:17.319
Jared! God, he's gonna
get us all killed!

37:17.404 --> 37:20.030
I'll be right back.
Keep pressure on that.

37:20.114 --> 37:21.990
Pressure? What?

37:22.075 --> 37:23.073
Jared?

37:23.158 --> 37:24.742
Why are they doing this?

37:24.827 --> 37:25.910
What do they want from us?

37:25.995 --> 37:27.245
The book.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.627
Oh, God!

37:34.712 --> 37:36.171
They're coming
from everywhere!

37:36.254 --> 37:38.756
I know, I can see.

37:38.841 --> 37:40.341
This can't
be happening.

37:40.426 --> 37:41.425
This can't
be happening.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.179
Where did you
get that book?

37:45.264 --> 37:47.682
So, the book was in here
with a big warning that said,

37:47.767 --> 37:49.808
"Do not read,"
and you read it?

37:49.893 --> 37:51.644
It's a book. I didn't
think reading it

37:51.728 --> 37:53.604
would unleash
goblin fury, okay?

37:53.689 --> 37:55.898
But that's the thing,
you never think of anything!

37:55.983 --> 37:57.608
You're always doing this!
Yeah, right.

37:57.693 --> 37:59.359
You don't think,
you just do!

37:59.444 --> 38:01.236
Maybe I could think
if you'd stop talking.

38:01.321 --> 38:03.321
You do stuff
and we pay for it.

38:03.406 --> 38:05.866
Hey, if you're so smart, what do
you think we should do with it?

38:05.950 --> 38:08.576
If freaky goblins want this
book, I say we give it to them!

38:08.661 --> 38:11.162
No!

38:11.247 --> 38:13.206
Back off!
The book stays here!

38:13.291 --> 38:15.250
Right here!
Here, here, here!

38:15.335 --> 38:17.168
No! Mallory, no! No!

38:17.253 --> 38:19.087
What is that hideous thing?

38:19.172 --> 38:21.756
Haven't I made myself that
clear? Touch it and you'll pay!

38:21.841 --> 38:22.510
Stop it! Chill! Chill!

38:22.511 --> 38:23.758
- Touch it and I'll
bite your fingers off!

38:23.843 --> 38:24.843
Get me some honey
from the kitchen.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.219
What?
- Just do it!

38:26.303 --> 38:27.345
Come on,
try it! Try it!

38:27.429 --> 38:28.763
I invite you
to try it!

38:28.848 --> 38:30.223
Go!
You'll be fingerless, you...

38:30.308 --> 38:31.765
You, get away!

38:31.850 --> 38:33.309
You ruined everything!
Okay, protect the book.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.310
Okay, I promise.

38:34.394 --> 38:36.270
Mallory!
- I'm coming!

38:36.355 --> 38:37.502
Okay, honey's coming,
honey's coming.

38:37.503 --> 38:38.105
Idiots!

38:38.190 --> 38:40.441
I don't need your stinking
honey! Here, drink, drink.

38:40.525 --> 38:43.069
Mmm! Mmm!

38:43.153 --> 38:44.570
It's okay. It's okay.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.364
It's okay?

38:46.447 --> 38:48.074
There is so much about this
that's not okay.

38:48.157 --> 38:50.785
I don't even know
where to start.

38:50.869 --> 38:52.786
Why can I see him
without that stone thing?

38:52.871 --> 38:54.539
Because he's
letting you see.

38:54.622 --> 38:58.000
Thimbletack, what happens
if goblins get the book?

38:58.085 --> 39:02.128
You die, I die,
we all die. Bye-bye.

39:02.213 --> 39:04.006
What does he mean,
we all die?

39:04.091 --> 39:05.841
I think he means
we all die.

39:05.926 --> 39:07.717
He can't know the
secrets. He can't!

39:07.802 --> 39:09.678
The ogre is not
to be trusted.

39:09.762 --> 39:11.931
He's right. We can't
give it to Mulgarath.

39:12.014 --> 39:13.307
He'll just kill
us anyway.

39:13.390 --> 39:14.724
I heard him say so.

39:14.809 --> 39:16.559
Then let's
just burn it.

39:21.149 --> 39:22.107
No!

39:22.691 --> 39:23.691
No!

39:25.110 --> 39:27.320
Give it! Give the book!

39:27.405 --> 39:29.114
Give it!

39:36.497 --> 39:38.915
Sorry, master! Forgive us!

39:39.709 --> 39:41.000
Give the book!

39:45.506 --> 39:47.047
Okay, okay, okay, wait!

39:47.132 --> 39:50.008
You win. You are strong,
smart human boy.

39:50.093 --> 39:52.469
So don't be foolish.
Give us the book.

39:52.554 --> 39:53.971
We'll leave you alone.

39:54.056 --> 39:55.347
I don't believe you!

39:55.432 --> 39:57.099
No!

39:57.183 --> 39:59.602
Now you've done it!
Now you will pay!

40:05.108 --> 40:07.275
Book!

40:07.360 --> 40:10.945
Book, book, book.

40:11.030 --> 40:15.993
Book, book, book, book, book.

40:18.371 --> 40:19.830
It's cold.

40:19.914 --> 40:21.164
You can't stay in
the circle forever.

40:21.249 --> 40:23.625
And when you leave,
here we will be.

40:41.059 --> 40:43.227
Let me guess, the
book's got a charm on it.

40:43.312 --> 40:45.062
Lest there fall
any more harm on it.

40:45.147 --> 40:45.938
Great.

40:47.399 --> 40:48.399
They're not leaving.

40:48.483 --> 40:49.692
I know.

40:49.777 --> 40:52.945
They're never leaving!
- I heard you.

40:53.029 --> 40:55.155
Why does he want that book so bad?
- I don't know.

40:55.240 --> 40:57.115
Well, figure it out!

40:57.200 --> 40:59.826
All I know is Mulgarath can't
break the circle without this book,

40:59.911 --> 41:01.745
so we're safe as long as
we stay in the house.

41:01.830 --> 41:03.455
Until when?

41:03.540 --> 41:06.541
We stay here long enough,
we're gonna end up like her!

41:07.669 --> 41:09.044
Wait a minute.

41:09.962 --> 41:11.505
She can help us.

41:11.590 --> 41:12.965
Aunt Lucinda?
Are you kidding?

41:13.048 --> 41:15.926
We don't even know her
or where she is!

41:16.010 --> 41:17.386
I think I do.

41:17.470 --> 41:20.013
She's at the Woodhaven
Sanatorium.

41:20.097 --> 41:21.764
But how do
you get to her?

41:21.849 --> 41:23.767
If you step outside that
circle, they'll get you.

41:23.851 --> 41:26.644
Thimbletack
knows a secret way.

41:26.729 --> 41:28.813
But in the house,
the book must stay.

41:35.404 --> 41:36.654
There, all safe.

41:36.739 --> 41:39.240
Good. Now go.
Make haste.

41:39.324 --> 41:41.951
Okay, I think I
have this figured out.

41:42.035 --> 41:44.913
Some sort of secret tunnel
system, goes all the way to town.

41:44.996 --> 41:47.331
About a mile, that way.

41:47.416 --> 41:50.542
The first ladder you find, go
up, and the sanatorium's here.

41:50.627 --> 41:51.835
Thanks.

41:53.339 --> 41:55.089
You ready?

41:55.174 --> 41:57.132
Oh, yeah.
Now I'm ready.

41:57.217 --> 41:58.633
All right. Let's go.

41:58.718 --> 42:00.177
Mallory?

42:00.262 --> 42:02.096
I already told you,
Simon, you can't go.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.597
Not with that leg,
you'll slow us down.

42:03.682 --> 42:05.598
I know, but I found this.

42:05.683 --> 42:07.267
It'll make it easier
for you to see.

42:15.109 --> 42:16.527
Okay, Simon?

42:20.865 --> 42:21.739
Go!

42:30.499 --> 42:32.000
Hey, are you there?

42:32.084 --> 42:33.293
Show yourselves!

42:36.880 --> 42:38.464
Yeah, right here,
on the porch!

42:38.549 --> 42:39.966
Come to me on the porch!

42:40.050 --> 42:41.050
Yeah, yeah, good.

42:41.135 --> 42:42.135
Right here, over here.

42:42.219 --> 42:44.136
Yeah, are you hungry?

42:44.221 --> 42:45.255
Right here on the porch.

42:45.256 --> 42:46.763
Come on. Hurry up. Get in.

42:46.848 --> 42:48.766
Go! Go! Go!

42:48.851 --> 42:50.476
They're coming!
Open the door!

42:50.561 --> 42:52.061
Jared, hurry!

42:52.146 --> 42:53.271
Come on!

42:53.354 --> 42:54.229
Get in, get in!

42:57.609 --> 42:59.443
Let's go! Go, go, go!

43:10.830 --> 43:12.373
Wait, wait, wait.

43:13.833 --> 43:15.500
This way, this way, this way.

43:16.878 --> 43:18.670
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

43:19.380 --> 43:20.673
Dig! Dig!

43:29.515 --> 43:30.390
Go!

43:32.267 --> 43:34.018
"Goblin defenses.

43:34.103 --> 43:36.605
"Tomato sauce burns
the skin like acid.

43:36.688 --> 43:38.690
"Vinegar fumes
asphyxiates.

43:38.775 --> 43:40.524
"Salt, blinding effect."

43:41.986 --> 43:43.778
Are there more?
What does the book say?

43:43.862 --> 43:46.948
Step away from the book!
Okay, okay, you open it.

43:51.620 --> 43:53.162
Where is it? Where
did he put it? Where?

43:53.247 --> 43:54.329
Oh, there.

43:55.499 --> 43:57.833
Oh, no. Jared.

43:57.918 --> 44:00.753
What did you do with it? Liars! Liars!
- No, it wasn't me.

44:00.838 --> 44:03.380
All of you, liars!
Where's the book?

44:06.176 --> 44:07.967
You brought
the book?

44:08.052 --> 44:09.386
We need to show it
to Lucinda.

44:11.222 --> 44:12.514
Which way goes
into town?

44:12.599 --> 44:13.556
Right.

44:22.275 --> 44:23.400
Get the troll.

44:26.821 --> 44:28.154
Now left. Go left!

44:36.497 --> 44:38.248
Oh, God.
What was that?

44:41.877 --> 44:43.503
It's a mole troll.
What?

44:43.588 --> 44:44.253
Run!

45:02.940 --> 45:04.147
This way!

45:07.402 --> 45:09.236
Go, go, go!

45:11.989 --> 45:13.114
Jared!

45:15.452 --> 45:16.284
Jared!

45:23.250 --> 45:25.293
Jared, come on!

45:49.776 --> 45:52.195
Are you okay? Oh, man,
did I hit somebody?

45:52.278 --> 45:53.821
Yes. Thank you!

45:57.033 --> 45:58.701
Then you hit F1,
tab, tab.

46:00.371 --> 46:02.704
Then shift-return
to get the total.

46:11.339 --> 46:13.173
I know, it's a lot to remember,

46:13.258 --> 46:14.508
but let's just go
through it again.

46:28.272 --> 46:29.940
Here you go.

46:30.024 --> 46:32.442
So tomato sauce really kills goblins?
- Mmm-hmm.

46:46.957 --> 46:48.207
Jared, come on.

46:51.294 --> 46:52.920
Wow,
you're really in a hurry.

46:53.004 --> 46:54.172
We're just really
excited to see her.

46:54.255 --> 46:55.757
Those are nice
flowers and sword.

46:55.840 --> 46:58.259
I take fencing.
- Huh.

46:58.343 --> 46:59.927
Lucinda?
You have visitors.

47:05.350 --> 47:06.183
More salt.

47:12.816 --> 47:14.566
There, there, there, now.

47:14.651 --> 47:16.235
It's okay.
It's okay.

47:16.319 --> 47:17.736
Aunt Lucinda?

47:22.283 --> 47:24.076
I'm Mallory Grace, and
this is my brother, Jared.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.786
Our mom's Helen.

47:29.707 --> 47:31.499
We have some
questions.

47:31.584 --> 47:32.626
See, we moved
into your house.

47:32.709 --> 47:33.709
What?

47:35.171 --> 47:37.172
Oh, no, no, no.

47:37.256 --> 47:39.382
No, it isn't safe.

47:39.467 --> 47:41.425
Why have you done this?

47:41.510 --> 47:44.220
Mom said you gave it to her
since she's the only living heir.

47:44.304 --> 47:45.388
No, you have to
get out of there.

47:45.473 --> 47:46.848
We can't.

47:46.933 --> 47:49.058
We don't have
anywhere else to go.

47:49.143 --> 47:50.893
It isn't safe.
You don't understand.

47:50.978 --> 47:53.313
Yes, we do.

47:53.396 --> 47:55.314
We know everything.
We've seen.

48:02.406 --> 48:04.865
It's okay. They've seen.

48:13.458 --> 48:14.499
Mallory, look.

48:32.769 --> 48:33.518
Mmm!

48:35.229 --> 48:36.854
No, no, not for you.

48:36.939 --> 48:38.356
She's right.

48:38.440 --> 48:40.608
Eat that and you'll never
crave human food again.

48:40.693 --> 48:41.734
How do you know that?

48:41.819 --> 48:44.111
I found this.

48:44.196 --> 48:45.696
Your father's
field guide.

48:49.869 --> 48:51.368
Inside, quickly, quickly!

48:51.453 --> 48:52.661
Quickly!

48:57.876 --> 49:02.629
Do you know what you've done by
bringing it outside the circle?

49:02.714 --> 49:04.464
Don't you know
what could happen

49:04.549 --> 49:06.092
if it falls into
the wrong hands?

49:06.176 --> 49:07.551
No, we don't.

49:07.636 --> 49:08.927
That's why I
brought it to you.

49:09.012 --> 49:10.595
Then you
haven't read it.

49:11.682 --> 49:12.598
He did.

49:15.602 --> 49:17.769
Then you know
more than you should.

49:17.854 --> 49:19.855
And your lives
are in danger.

49:19.939 --> 49:22.149
Didn't you read
the note?

49:22.233 --> 49:25.653
Please. We don't know what to do.

49:25.736 --> 49:28.405
Can't you tell us something
that'll help us?

49:34.079 --> 49:38.456
This book has brought nothing but
heartache and misery to my family.

49:41.418 --> 49:42.961
I would say it
was his life's work,

49:43.045 --> 49:44.170
but, in truth,
it was his life.

49:46.924 --> 49:50.677
<i>The last day I saw him
he was so agitated,</i>

49:50.761 --> 49:53.596
<i>almost delirious.</i>

49:53.681 --> 49:55.764
<i>I remember him
running through the house,</i>

49:55.849 --> 49:57.308
<i>a crazed look in his eyes.</i>

49:59.728 --> 50:02.730
<i>That was the day he
created the circle,</i>

50:02.814 --> 50:05.274
<i>the day that he learned
what he had done</i>

50:05.359 --> 50:08.068
<i>by putting all those secrets
into one book,</i>

50:08.153 --> 50:12.364
<i>a book Mulgarath would use to
destroy all the other faeries.</i>

50:12.449 --> 50:15.450
<i>And then nothing could
stop him, even humans,</i>

50:15.535 --> 50:17.244
from becoming the
most powerful creature

50:17.329 --> 50:19.496
the world
had ever known.

50:19.581 --> 50:23.625
<i>My father immediately did
everything he could to protect us.</i>

50:23.710 --> 50:25.293
<i>Everything except...</i>

50:25.378 --> 50:27.003
Master must
destroy the book!

50:27.088 --> 50:29.465
No! We need to protect it!

50:29.548 --> 50:33.134
Keep it inside the circle,
safe from the ogre!

50:33.219 --> 50:34.636
I just need more time,
Thimbletack.

50:34.721 --> 50:36.513
I need more time.

50:36.597 --> 50:39.641
But I didn't know about
the circle, you see.

50:39.726 --> 50:42.977
# London Bridge
is falling down

50:43.062 --> 50:44.228
# Falling down

50:44.313 --> 50:45.604
Oh, no!

50:45.689 --> 50:47.357
# Falling down

50:47.442 --> 50:50.776
# London Bridge
is falling down

50:50.861 --> 50:53.070
Lucy!

50:53.155 --> 50:54.739
Come away
from the toadstools!

50:54.824 --> 50:56.324
What?

50:56.408 --> 50:57.491
Stay inside the circle!

50:57.576 --> 50:58.576
I can't hear you!

50:58.660 --> 50:59.952
Lucy! No!

51:00.036 --> 51:03.414
# London Bridge
is falling down #

51:06.376 --> 51:08.335
Daddy! Please, help me!

51:08.420 --> 51:10.212
Somebody's
dragging me, Daddy!

51:10.297 --> 51:11.922
Leave her alone!
- Daddy!

51:14.217 --> 51:17.761
Lucy, come!
Come! Stay there!

51:17.846 --> 51:19.429
Stay inside the circle!

51:19.514 --> 51:20.722
Daddy! Daddy,
what's going on?

51:20.807 --> 51:22.682
What's happening?

51:22.767 --> 51:24.017
Don't go over the mushrooms!
No!

51:25.186 --> 51:26.978
What are those?

51:27.063 --> 51:28.229
Daddy, what
are those things?

51:28.314 --> 51:29.523
Tell me!

51:32.193 --> 51:33.818
Daddy! Daddy?

51:34.529 --> 51:36.238
Daddy?

51:36.321 --> 51:39.408
<i>The sylph protect
the entire faerie realm,</i>

51:39.491 --> 51:43.578
<i>and the secrets my father
discovered put them in danger.</i>

51:43.663 --> 51:46.581
<i>So they rescued him
from the goblins,</i>

51:46.665 --> 51:48.707
<i>but took him away from me.</i>

51:48.792 --> 51:51.836
Daddy!
- Lucy! I'll be back!

51:52.755 --> 51:54.214
Each day,

51:55.466 --> 51:57.216
I would stare
down that drive,

51:59.052 --> 52:01.721
and dream of him
walking up those steps

52:03.515 --> 52:06.726
and holding me in
his arms once again.

52:08.728 --> 52:10.187
But he never did.

52:12.273 --> 52:16.443
One night, I dreamt that
I saw him in the woods.

52:16.528 --> 52:18.779
So I went out
to look for him,

52:20.323 --> 52:23.158
but something
wouldn't let me.

52:26.370 --> 52:30.958
When they say suicide
and you say goblins,

52:31.041 --> 52:32.709
here is where
they put you.

52:35.462 --> 52:38.715
They thought I'd
read the book, you see.

52:38.800 --> 52:43.302
Mulgarath will stop at
nothing to get these secrets,

52:43.387 --> 52:47.390
which is why you and your
family are in grave danger.

52:47.475 --> 52:50.601
And there is only one
person who can help you.

52:50.686 --> 52:51.852
Who?

52:51.937 --> 52:52.394
My father.

52:54.857 --> 52:57.692
Your father?
But your father's dead.

52:57.777 --> 53:00.235
No! No, no,
he's not dead.

53:00.320 --> 53:02.863
The sprites have
told me he's alive,

53:02.948 --> 53:06.492
held captive by the sylph
for all that he knows.

53:06.577 --> 53:09.203
You must find him,

53:09.288 --> 53:12.998
bring him his book
and have him destroy it.

53:13.083 --> 53:15.751
It is your only hope.

53:17.337 --> 53:19.212
No!
- Give me that!

53:19.297 --> 53:20.922
Where did he come from?

53:24.385 --> 53:26.095
No!

53:26.179 --> 53:27.553
Horrible, horrible!

53:32.685 --> 53:33.768
Mom?

53:36.438 --> 53:37.731
Useless!

53:39.192 --> 53:41.317
Worthless! No.
- Wait. Wait.

53:41.402 --> 53:43.027
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

53:43.112 --> 53:44.695
What's this?
What's this? No?

53:44.780 --> 53:47.073
You had the book
in your possession,

53:47.158 --> 53:51.660
and all you bring me is pages
of nixies and phooka habitats!

53:51.745 --> 53:52.995
Don't hurt me.

53:54.206 --> 53:55.123
It hurts!

53:57.960 --> 54:00.544
"Charm for
protective circle."

54:01.796 --> 54:03.547
Forgive me, master.

54:05.926 --> 54:09.720
When the moon rises,
the book will be mine.

54:09.805 --> 54:13.015
Redcap,
we have a potion to make.

54:13.100 --> 54:15.267
Oh, no.
This is not good.

54:15.352 --> 54:18.187
Must find human boy.
Must warn him.

54:18.271 --> 54:21.356
Or maybe I'll just hide.
Ooh, I like that plan.

54:21.441 --> 54:23.901
So,
you say you found this book,

54:23.986 --> 54:26.361
and it tells you
how to see faeries

54:26.446 --> 54:28.404
and goblins and
magic sprites,

54:28.489 --> 54:31.867
and that's what
this is all about.

54:31.952 --> 54:34.703
I told you you
wouldn't believe me.

54:34.787 --> 54:35.954
What do you think
about all this, Mal?

54:36.038 --> 54:37.622
It's true, Mom.

54:37.707 --> 54:39.415
No, it's not!

54:39.500 --> 54:43.211
Do you really
think I am so stupid

54:43.295 --> 54:45.338
that I don't see
what this is about?

54:45.423 --> 54:47.256
You hate the house

54:47.341 --> 54:50.260
and you want to go back to
New York and to our old life!

54:50.344 --> 54:53.304
Well, let me just be
really clear when I say

54:55.349 --> 54:58.100
that isn't gonna happen.

54:58.185 --> 55:00.686
Because we can't afford
New York, because...

55:05.735 --> 55:07.568
This is why Dad left,
you know.

55:08.612 --> 55:10.654
Excuse me?

55:10.739 --> 55:11.947
When someone's trying to tell you
something you don't wanna hear,

55:12.032 --> 55:13.407
this is what you do.

55:13.492 --> 55:15.492
You just stop listening
and start yelling.

55:15.577 --> 55:17.035
You did it to Dad
all the time.

55:17.120 --> 55:18.453
Stop it.
- I saw you.

55:18.538 --> 55:20.289
Yeah, you saw what
you wanted to see.

55:20.373 --> 55:21.582
You wouldn't listen,
and that's why he left!

55:25.961 --> 55:27.129
Get out.

55:27.213 --> 55:28.671
What?
- I said get out.

55:29.758 --> 55:30.799
Gladly.

55:34.971 --> 55:37.597
I hate you, and I don't
want to live with you!

55:48.276 --> 55:51.068
Don't you think you
should just tell him?

55:55.116 --> 55:58.201
Go inside, Mal. We'll deal
with this when I get home.

56:17.721 --> 56:19.138
Oh, my!
We're so organized.

56:19.223 --> 56:20.639
Organized,
organized, organized.

56:20.724 --> 56:21.932
Look at that.
Oh, that's very good.

56:22.016 --> 56:23.350
More bombs for you.

56:23.435 --> 56:24.810
The book!
What happened to the book?

56:24.895 --> 56:26.227
What did you do
to the book?

56:26.312 --> 56:27.896
It's okay, it's okay.
I'll talk to him.

56:27.981 --> 56:29.690
Stained!

56:29.774 --> 56:31.275
You said you wouldn't take
the book, and you lied!

56:31.358 --> 56:33.693
You tricked him!
- I know. I'm sorry.

56:33.778 --> 56:35.903
Jared, I think you
should come and see this.

56:46.582 --> 56:49.584
See? No goblins.

56:49.668 --> 56:50.793
Do you think
they've given up?

56:50.878 --> 56:51.962
Wrong!

56:52.045 --> 56:53.463
Goblins don't give up.

56:53.547 --> 56:56.299
They're too stupid
to know how.

56:56.383 --> 56:59.844
They're relentless, and they're
out there right now, plotting,

56:59.929 --> 57:02.221
which is why I
came back for you.

57:02.306 --> 57:04.223
Now is the perfect time to...

57:04.308 --> 57:07.184
Bird! Bird!

57:07.269 --> 57:08.894
Oh, come here,
come here, come here.

57:08.979 --> 57:10.730
Don't go up there!
No, come here!

57:10.814 --> 57:11.981
What is that?

57:12.065 --> 57:12.565
It's Hogsqueal.

57:14.317 --> 57:15.567
Wait a minute.

57:15.652 --> 57:16.943
Do birds live in
these little houses?

57:17.028 --> 57:18.653
Yeah.

57:18.738 --> 57:20.072
Oh, my gosh. That's
genius. Who thought of that?

57:20.156 --> 57:21.281
You can stick
your tongue right in.

57:21.366 --> 57:24.285
Hogsqueal! Hogsqueal!

57:24.368 --> 57:26.203
You said the goblins
are plotting. To do what?

57:26.287 --> 57:28.372
They have pages
of the book.

57:28.456 --> 57:30.623
That stupid book!

57:30.708 --> 57:31.833
You don't understand.

57:31.918 --> 57:33.001
I talked to Spiderwick.

57:33.086 --> 57:35.420
I shared hobgoblin secrets.

57:35.504 --> 57:37.923
But Mulgarath stole
just that one page,

57:38.007 --> 57:40.300
then used it to
kill my entire family!

57:40.384 --> 57:42.635
If he gets ahold
of the whole book,

57:42.720 --> 57:45.930
he will do the same to
everyone, including you!

57:46.015 --> 57:47.556
And now he's coming.

57:47.641 --> 57:49.184
"When the moon rises,"
he said.

57:49.268 --> 57:52.228
But we'll be waiting.
We'll set a trap.

57:52.313 --> 57:57.232
You with your knife and me hiding
safely near these bird homes.

57:57.317 --> 57:58.942
Who is that?
Who's up there?

57:59.027 --> 58:00.570
Ooh! Ooh!
More humungous humans!

58:00.655 --> 58:02.363
Recruits for
the alliance!

58:06.535 --> 58:09.871
Huh? Huh?
Join us on our quest!

58:09.955 --> 58:12.914
Vengeance or death!

58:12.999 --> 58:14.499
Hopefully vengeance.

58:14.584 --> 58:16.752
Okay, here's the plan.

58:16.837 --> 58:18.421
No, no.
Wait, wait, wait!

58:18.504 --> 58:20.714
We must unite!
We must stay focused!

58:24.553 --> 58:27.638
Dad, I've left
like four messages.

58:27.723 --> 58:29.473
Why haven't you called back?

58:29.558 --> 58:32.016
Where are you?

58:32.101 --> 58:33.268
You've got to
come here right now.

58:33.353 --> 58:35.895
There's all this crazy...

58:35.980 --> 58:38.440
All this weird
stuff's been happening.

58:38.524 --> 58:40.359
Bad stuff, real bad.

58:40.442 --> 58:42.485
And you, you said
you were gonna come get me.

58:42.570 --> 58:43.779
So where are you?

58:52.621 --> 58:54.080
He's not coming, is he?

58:59.044 --> 59:00.628
He's with someone else.

59:02.298 --> 59:03.631
He's moved in with her.

59:05.384 --> 59:07.134
He's not getting
back with Mom.

59:09.179 --> 59:10.137
He's not.

59:15.143 --> 59:16.851
Mom wanted him
to tell you himself.

59:18.480 --> 59:20.773
She's been waiting
for him to do that.

59:34.328 --> 59:36.663
It's okay, Tibbsy.
It's okay.

59:38.250 --> 59:40.208
Oh, God,
they're coming.

59:40.293 --> 59:41.292
Jared, what do we do now?

59:48.509 --> 59:50.509
Lucinda said
our only chance

59:50.594 --> 59:52.595
is to take the book to Arthur
Spiderwick and have him destroy it.

59:52.679 --> 59:54.597
What?

59:54.682 --> 59:57.600
We don't even know if he's
alive, let alone how to find him.

01:00:05.484 --> 01:00:06.525
What? What are you looking for?

01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:08.153
He had a pet.

01:00:08.236 --> 01:00:11.364
A pet? And Fluffy the
dog is gonna save us?

01:00:11.447 --> 01:00:15.159
It wasn't a dog.
It was this, a griffin.

01:00:15.244 --> 01:00:18.079
"When I call upon him in the
native tongue of the tree elf

01:00:18.164 --> 01:00:21.540
"with whom he dwells,
he comes to my assistance."

01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:24.418
See? His pet
can find him.

01:00:24.502 --> 01:00:28.588
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Summon a
griffin in native tree elf

01:00:28.673 --> 01:00:31.967
to find a 125-year-old man
who may or may not be alive?

01:00:32.052 --> 01:00:33.718
That's our plan?

01:00:33.803 --> 01:00:35.637
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:35.722 --> 01:00:38.682
And you know how to summon
a griffin in native tree elf?

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.979
Of course.

01:00:59.036 --> 01:01:00.286
Is that it?

01:01:01.455 --> 01:01:02.789
Did it work?

01:01:05.626 --> 01:01:07.251
I guess not.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.967
Whoa! That sounds like a big one.

01:01:15.052 --> 01:01:17.803
Okay! Here, birdie,
birdie, birdie.

01:01:17.888 --> 01:01:19.806
Come to Hogsqueal.

01:01:19.889 --> 01:01:21.432
Oh, wow.

01:01:21.517 --> 01:01:24.684
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:01:34.863 --> 01:01:36.238
Jared! Jared!

01:01:36.323 --> 01:01:37.781
Simon, be careful!

01:01:37.865 --> 01:01:40.075
Yes, yes, yes!
Find Arthur Spiderwick.

01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:41.326
Bring him the book.

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:42.494
There's your ride.
Off you go.

01:01:42.579 --> 01:01:43.870
Go, go, go!

01:01:43.955 --> 01:01:45.830
What? You want us
to ride that beast?

01:01:45.915 --> 01:01:49.334
He's not a beast.
He's a bird.

01:01:49.419 --> 01:01:51.211
He's a big-boned bird!

01:01:51.295 --> 01:01:53.838
There's no way we can possibly...
- Shh...

01:01:53.922 --> 01:01:55.757
It's okay.
Calm down. It's okay.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.635
Cool pet.

01:02:01.681 --> 01:02:02.679
Hurry up!
What are you waiting for?

01:02:02.764 --> 01:02:03.431
Get on him!

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:52.536
My God, it's him.

01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:54.998
Arthur Spiderwick.

01:03:56.709 --> 01:03:58.168
He's alive.

01:03:58.253 --> 01:03:59.419
Whoa.

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:14.058
How are we gonna
get home?

01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:15.476
Arthur Spiderwick?

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:20.063
Thank God we found you.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:22.691
You don't even know
what we've been through.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.484
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.487
Um, not really.

01:04:26.572 --> 01:04:30.824
Lucinda, your daughter,
our great-aunt, she sent us.

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:33.243
Lucy? She's only
6-and-a-half years old.

01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:36.371
No. No, she's 86-and-a-half.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:41.293
Well, that's nonsense.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:42.628
I was with her
only this morning.

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:46.631
Or was that yesterday?

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:49.801
No, that was 80 years ago!

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.677
Listen, you gotta believe me.

01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:53.430
You're my great-great-uncle.

01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:56.557
Help me out, guys.

01:04:57.685 --> 01:04:59.143
Guys?

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.603
What's happening?

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:01.687
What's the matter
with them?

01:05:01.772 --> 01:05:03.606
The sylphs.

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:06.358
Their songs must have altered
my perception of time.

01:05:06.443 --> 01:05:08.361
That is what they do.

01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:11.489
Lucy's an old
woman now, you say?

01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:14.783
That must mean
that my wife is...

01:05:14.868 --> 01:05:16.452
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

01:05:16.537 --> 01:05:19.372
Look, I'm sorry
about all that, really.

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:20.998
But you gotta help us.
I found your book.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.708
The field guide? No!

01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:24.084
No, not here.
Not now.

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:27.504
Don't listen to them.

01:05:28.048 --> 01:05:29.506
Follow me.

01:05:35.722 --> 01:05:37.347
Here! Under here!

01:05:37.432 --> 01:05:38.682
Quickly,
while they're distracted.

01:05:42.562 --> 01:05:44.312
The book,
give me the book.

01:05:44.397 --> 01:05:45.938
Oh, the field guide.

01:05:47.858 --> 01:05:50.359
The field guide.

01:05:50.444 --> 01:05:52.194
You should never
have read this.

01:05:52.279 --> 01:05:54.281
You should not have brought
this outside the circle.

01:05:54.364 --> 01:05:57.658
I know. I know, but I brought it
to you so you could destroy it.

01:05:58.744 --> 01:06:00.578
Destroy it?

01:06:00.663 --> 01:06:02.372
No. Are you mad?

01:06:02.457 --> 01:06:04.457
I have uncovered
all of their secrets.

01:06:04.542 --> 01:06:05.958
And this book
is my validation.

01:06:06.043 --> 01:06:07.710
This book is my life.

01:06:07.795 --> 01:06:11.548
You're 125 years old!
Your life is over!

01:06:11.631 --> 01:06:13.508
And your daughter spent
her life without a father,

01:06:13.593 --> 01:06:15.301
all because
of that book.

01:06:22.392 --> 01:06:24.267
I never imagined
that the things I'd learned

01:06:24.352 --> 01:06:27.187
could possibly
have led to this.

01:06:27.272 --> 01:06:31.025
Look, I know stuff
I wish I didn't, too,

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:34.195
but there's nothing
I can do about that.

01:06:34.278 --> 01:06:37.781
One thing I know for sure is
that you gotta destroy that book.

01:06:43.913 --> 01:06:45.914
What's this?
- What?

01:06:45.998 --> 01:06:47.833
What's wrong?
- Where's my book?

01:06:47.917 --> 01:06:49.793
What is this?

01:06:49.878 --> 01:06:52.838
Thimbletack,
he switched the pages.

01:06:52.922 --> 01:06:55.131
But the real book is still
inside the circle. It's safe.

01:06:55.216 --> 01:06:57.591
No, Mulgarath got pages.
- What?

01:06:57.676 --> 01:06:59.176
He'll break the circle
as soon as...

01:06:59.261 --> 01:07:00.595
As soon as
the moon rises, I know.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.930
That's when Mom
will be getting home.

01:07:02.014 --> 01:07:03.389
I gotta get back.

01:07:03.474 --> 01:07:05.641
No! They won't
let you leave.

01:07:05.726 --> 01:07:08.102
They'll keep you here for the
same reason they're keeping me.

01:07:08.187 --> 01:07:09.687
We know too much.

01:07:13.233 --> 01:07:15.276
Then what are
we gonna do?

01:07:15.361 --> 01:07:17.152
Please, you've
gotta help us!

01:07:17.237 --> 01:07:19.447
If I'm as old
as you say I am,

01:07:19.531 --> 01:07:21.073
I'm useless
outside this glade.

01:07:35.088 --> 01:07:38.089
The last thing I said to
my mom was, "I hate you."

01:07:43.763 --> 01:07:45.764
Listen, son.

01:07:45.849 --> 01:07:48.433
The boy who had
the tenacity to find me,

01:07:48.518 --> 01:07:50.435
doesn't need my help.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.189
Now, Mulgarath wants the power
that comes with knowledge.

01:07:55.107 --> 01:07:57.109
You have that knowledge.

01:07:57.192 --> 01:07:58.735
You are the book now.

01:08:04.783 --> 01:08:06.910
And you have to
get out of here. Now.

01:08:11.289 --> 01:08:13.124
Yes!

01:08:13.208 --> 01:08:16.167
I think I can distract them.

01:08:16.252 --> 01:08:18.962
On my signal, run to
your brother and sister.

01:08:19.048 --> 01:08:21.090
You'll only have a few
moments to escape.

01:08:21.174 --> 01:08:23.259
But...
- Await my signal.

01:08:23.343 --> 01:08:25.428
But...

01:08:25.511 --> 01:08:29.305
Here! Here!
I have the field guide!

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:31.640
Do you want it?
Yes, here!

01:08:31.725 --> 01:08:33.810
Come take it! You can
keep it safe right here!

01:08:36.189 --> 01:08:36.770
Now!

01:08:52.037 --> 01:08:54.831
Yes, Byron! Yes!

01:08:54.916 --> 01:08:56.749
Get them home safely!

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:03.798
Come on, snap out of it!
Come on!

01:10:02.273 --> 01:10:04.690
Oh, shoot! They
started spreading the potion.

01:10:07.361 --> 01:10:08.361
Oh, no.
There's Mom.

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:11.865
Mom! No! Turn around!

01:10:11.949 --> 01:10:12.990
Go away, Mom!

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:14.159
Stop the car!

01:10:14.242 --> 01:10:15.576
What?

01:10:18.330 --> 01:10:19.705
Mom, move over!

01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:21.123
What are you doing?

01:10:21.208 --> 01:10:23.042
Mallory, you drive!

01:10:23.127 --> 01:10:24.418
Get the car
inside the circle!

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:27.504
Go, go!

01:10:27.589 --> 01:10:28.797
You're not
driving this car!

01:10:28.882 --> 01:10:30.424
Stop it! Mal, stop!

01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:40.434
Thank God.

01:10:40.518 --> 01:10:42.519
Will someone please
tell me what's going on?

01:10:42.604 --> 01:10:43.854
Jared, what do
we do now?

01:10:43.938 --> 01:10:45.689
Protect the house.

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.231
Simon, the sage in the planter boxes.
- I know, I know.

01:10:47.316 --> 01:10:48.941
Hang them in the windows!
I'm on it.

01:10:49.026 --> 01:10:50.819
Mal, go upstairs and get
all of Lucinda's salt.

01:10:50.904 --> 01:10:52.029
All of it?
- All of it!

01:10:52.113 --> 01:10:53.237
Okay. Okay.

01:10:53.322 --> 01:10:54.406
Thimbletack!

01:10:54.490 --> 01:10:56.825
Jared!
- Thimbletack!

01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:59.244
The circle's about to be
broken! Please come out!

01:10:59.329 --> 01:11:01.246
Jared! Jared!
What is going on?

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:03.873
Mom, you've got to believe me. Okay?
- No! No!

01:11:03.958 --> 01:11:06.710
One more word about faeries
and goblins and I swear...

01:11:06.793 --> 01:11:09.212
Goblins, I know. But I hid the
book. They'll never find it.

01:11:09.296 --> 01:11:10.505
Well, I hope they don't.
Unless...

01:11:12.091 --> 01:11:13.424
Why is she screaming?

01:11:13.508 --> 01:11:14.676
I'm the one who
should be screaming.

01:11:14.759 --> 01:11:16.594
The circle's
about to be broken!

01:11:16.678 --> 01:11:18.471
Mom, no!
He's not the problem.

01:11:20.057 --> 01:11:20.973
They are.

01:11:24.937 --> 01:11:26.353
Get in there!
Get in there!

01:11:32.778 --> 01:11:34.111
We have to protect
the house.

01:11:34.195 --> 01:11:35.154
Understand?

01:11:39.284 --> 01:11:42.952
Hurry, hurry!
Yeah, get every opening!

01:11:43.037 --> 01:11:44.996
Okay,
the living room's done!

01:11:45.081 --> 01:11:46.581
Simon, do the music room!

01:11:46.666 --> 01:11:48.792
Okay, okay,
I got it!

01:11:48.876 --> 01:11:50.460
Steel, it cuts and burns.

01:11:52.338 --> 01:11:53.421
Good thing
we're New Yorkers.

01:11:58.427 --> 01:12:00.136
Wait, wait,
here it comes.

01:12:00.221 --> 01:12:01.763
Here it comes.

01:12:14.901 --> 01:12:16.444
The circle is broken.

01:12:16.529 --> 01:12:18.154
The circle is broken.

01:12:18.239 --> 01:12:21.740
The circle is broken! Attack!

01:12:38.383 --> 01:12:39.716
The windows and
doors are protected.

01:12:39.801 --> 01:12:41.802
Get down there.
Go low! Go low!

01:12:41.887 --> 01:12:44.054
Break it!
Break on through! Come on!

01:12:46.016 --> 01:12:48.474
The rest of you, up!
Up, up, up!

01:12:48.559 --> 01:12:51.061
Go, you toads!
Go! Find the book!

01:12:55.524 --> 01:12:56.983
Where did they go?

01:12:57.902 --> 01:12:58.985
Did it work?

01:13:50.203 --> 01:13:51.536
Come on, Jared!
Come on!

01:13:51.621 --> 01:13:52.829
Let's go!
Let's go!

01:13:52.914 --> 01:13:54.498
Get back, Jared!
Get back!

01:13:56.834 --> 01:13:58.585
Go, go, go!
Run!

01:14:36.039 --> 01:14:38.540
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

01:14:38.625 --> 01:14:40.459
Simon, get the back door!
- I'm on it!

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:42.002
Mal, help me!

01:14:46.174 --> 01:14:47.800
It won't hold for long.

01:14:50.052 --> 01:14:51.345
Give me a hand.

01:14:58.061 --> 01:15:00.187
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:15:00.271 --> 01:15:01.771
Go, go, go! Go!

01:15:11.574 --> 01:15:14.033
Go on! Get in there!
Where did they go?

01:15:14.118 --> 01:15:15.409
Where are they?
Where are they?

01:15:15.494 --> 01:15:16.744
Come on, let's find them.

01:15:16.829 --> 01:15:18.037
You, over there,
to the left.

01:15:18.122 --> 01:15:19.414
You, to the right.

01:15:19.498 --> 01:15:21.249
Spread out, spread out.

01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:22.916
That's right, over there.

01:15:24.003 --> 01:15:25.461
Wait a minute.

01:15:25.545 --> 01:15:27.129
Wait a minute!

01:15:28.799 --> 01:15:30.090
Uh-oh.

01:15:30.175 --> 01:15:30.757
Uh-oh!

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:34.595
Oh, sh...

01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:02.330
Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:07.544
It worked.

01:16:07.628 --> 01:16:08.670
Yeah.

01:16:10.381 --> 01:16:11.965
Book safe?

01:16:12.049 --> 01:16:13.882
Yes. Good job, Thimbletack.

01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:15.551
Thank God.

01:16:19.056 --> 01:16:20.597
What is it?

01:16:20.682 --> 01:16:21.682
Come on.

01:16:34.446 --> 01:16:35.028
Dad?

01:16:37.616 --> 01:16:39.116
What happened?

01:16:39.201 --> 01:16:40.743
Richard?

01:16:40.827 --> 01:16:42.119
What are you
doing here?

01:16:42.203 --> 01:16:43.120
What's going on?

01:16:44.789 --> 01:16:46.123
Where do we start?

01:16:48.168 --> 01:16:49.334
With this, I guess.

01:16:51.213 --> 01:16:52.879
What's that?
Let me see.

01:16:53.881 --> 01:16:54.714
No!

01:16:57.885 --> 01:17:00.511
Not until you tell me
what you need to tell me.

01:17:00.596 --> 01:17:02.055
What?

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.556
The last time we
were on the phone,

01:17:03.641 --> 01:17:05.266
you said
the next time we met,

01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:07.644
you had something
you needed to say to me.

01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:09.603
So what is it?

01:17:12.733 --> 01:17:15.401
Look me in
the eyes and tell me.

01:17:20.241 --> 01:17:21.532
I just want to
hear you say it.

01:17:25.162 --> 01:17:26.162
I...

01:17:29.249 --> 01:17:31.375
I just wanted to tell
you that I love you.

01:17:35.505 --> 01:17:36.630
Let me see.

01:17:39.968 --> 01:17:40.926
Jared.

01:17:41.010 --> 01:17:42.636
Wrong answer.

01:17:44.014 --> 01:17:45.639
Jared!
- Get back! Get back!

01:17:45.724 --> 01:17:46.932
What did you do?

01:17:47.016 --> 01:17:48.057
It's not Dad!
- What?

01:17:50.102 --> 01:17:51.145
Oh, my God!

01:17:58.987 --> 01:18:02.697
Now give me the book!

01:18:02.782 --> 01:18:04.282
Run, Jared!

01:18:25.054 --> 01:18:28.096
Give me the book.
Give me the book.

01:18:43.613 --> 01:18:44.530
Back off!

01:18:52.956 --> 01:18:54.373
Thimbletack!

01:19:35.538 --> 01:19:37.664
Give me the book!

01:19:47.634 --> 01:19:48.425
Jared!

01:19:51.804 --> 01:19:54.223
Give me the book!

01:19:59.729 --> 01:20:00.979
Oh, yeah.

01:20:01.064 --> 01:20:02.731
Give me the book now!

01:20:04.066 --> 01:20:05.734
You want the book?
- Yeah.

01:20:05.819 --> 01:20:07.694
Go get it!

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:23.834
Oh! Mmm, mmm, mmm!

01:20:36.557 --> 01:20:37.932
Jared! Jared!

01:20:40.018 --> 01:20:41.810
Jared, are you okay?

01:20:41.895 --> 01:20:43.770
Jared, you did it.

01:20:43.855 --> 01:20:46.524
Oh, my God. Oh,
my God. Jared, are you okay?

01:20:48.193 --> 01:20:50.944
Yes! Death to the ogre!

01:20:51.029 --> 01:20:52.821
We did it!
You sent him right to me,

01:20:52.906 --> 01:20:55.031
and I ate him!
That's teamwork! Oh!

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:57.075
The taste of
vengeance is sweet!

01:20:57.160 --> 01:21:00.621
I can still taste a little!
Oh, it's good!

01:21:00.705 --> 01:21:02.831
I did it!
I knew I could do it!

01:21:02.916 --> 01:21:04.958
They said I couldn't,
but I did it!

01:21:05.042 --> 01:21:08.044
It's the field guide.
Here, we'll help you.

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:09.003
Jared.

01:21:13.217 --> 01:21:15.927
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you. I mean...

01:21:16.012 --> 01:21:17.637
No, I'm sorry.

01:21:17.722 --> 01:21:18.888
No, listen, I...

01:21:18.973 --> 01:21:20.514
For what I said,
I didn't mean...

01:21:20.599 --> 01:21:23.143
Jared, it's not
your fault.

01:21:23.227 --> 01:21:25.436
It's mine.

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.063
I was trying
to protect you,

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:30.941
but I guess I should have
just told you the truth.

01:21:31.026 --> 01:21:34.611
Your dad does love you, and if you
want to stay with him, that's...

01:21:34.696 --> 01:21:36.489
I don't want
to live with Dad.

01:21:39.451 --> 01:21:42.829
Is it okay if I
stay here with you?

01:21:47.333 --> 01:21:48.417
Is it okay?

01:21:52.506 --> 01:21:54.214
Who else is gonna
protect us?

01:22:13.484 --> 01:22:15.610
I'll go put this
in your old room.

01:22:23.244 --> 01:22:24.119
Oh!

01:22:25.496 --> 01:22:27.121
My old friend Thimbletack.

01:22:29.375 --> 01:22:31.917
My little guardian angel.

01:22:32.002 --> 01:22:33.877
I've missed you
so much.

01:22:33.962 --> 01:22:36.380
Book safe, Lucy.
Book safe.

01:22:36.465 --> 01:22:39.299
Yes, yes.

01:22:39.384 --> 01:22:43.053
And if my father were here,
he'd say, "Job well done."

01:22:45.766 --> 01:22:46.807
Aunt Lucinda?

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.935
I think you should
come see this.

01:23:33.103 --> 01:23:34.062
Am I dreaming?

01:23:35.605 --> 01:23:37.648
No, my child. You're not.

01:23:38.275 --> 01:23:39.775
Child?

01:23:40.944 --> 01:23:42.778
Do you know
how old I am?

01:23:43.530 --> 01:23:45.155
Yes, I do.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.908
I'm so sorry.

01:23:47.993 --> 01:23:51.036
I was so captivated by all
the magical creatures I found

01:23:51.121 --> 01:23:53.580
that I lost sight of
the one I already had.

01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:57.209
But I see now,

01:23:57.294 --> 01:23:59.670
and I may never be able
to forgive myself.

01:24:01.465 --> 01:24:03.173
You came back
as you promised,

01:24:04.551 --> 01:24:06.342
so I forgive you.

01:24:06.427 --> 01:24:09.888
My dear,
because the book was saved,

01:24:09.972 --> 01:24:12.391
the sylph allowed me
to come see you,

01:24:12.474 --> 01:24:14.934
but I cannot stay.

01:24:16.562 --> 01:24:18.813
Because if I do,

01:24:18.898 --> 01:24:20.607
all my years will
come back to me,

01:24:20.692 --> 01:24:22.942
all at once,
and I will turn to dust.

01:24:28.032 --> 01:24:31.784
Then this time,
take me with you.

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:13.117
Daddy.

01:25:16.871 --> 01:25:18.163
Oh, Lucy.

01:25:25.171 --> 01:25:26.754
Come with me.
- Okay.

01:26:31.818 --> 01:26:33.277
Hey, come on.

01:26:42.704 --> 01:26:44.580
Fly while you can, griffin.

01:26:44.664 --> 01:26:46.290
I swallowed an ogre whole.

01:26:46.374 --> 01:26:48.007
You could be next.

01:31:47.834 --> 01:31:48.834
