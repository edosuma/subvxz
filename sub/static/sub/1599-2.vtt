00:02.670 --> 00:04.837
Blaine:<i> In a world</i>
<i>where everything changes,</i>

00:04.839 --> 00:07.373
<i>Some things</i>
<i>always stay the same.</i>

00:07.375 --> 00:08.707
<i>They say</i>
<i>there's only three things</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:10.042
<i>You can count on in life:</i>

00:10.044 --> 00:14.046
<i>Death, taxes</i>
<i>and dalton academy.</i>

00:14.048 --> 00:16.048
<i>When kurt and i broke up,</i>
<i>i was devastated.</i>

00:16.050 --> 00:18.150
<i>I thought i was gonna spend</i>
<i>the rest of my life with him,</i>

00:18.152 --> 00:20.686
<i>And then suddenly he was gone.</i>

00:21.956 --> 00:23.355
<i>My therapist told me</i>
<i>i should concentrate</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:26.025
<i>On the thing i love most:</i>
<i>Music.</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:27.860
<i>And then,</i>
<i>i couldn't even do that.</i>

00:27.862 --> 00:30.829
<i>But then i started</i>
<i>coaching the warblers,</i>

00:30.831 --> 00:33.198
<i>And i was totally</i>
<i>reinvigorated.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:38.070
¶ oh, yeah! ¶

00:38.072 --> 00:41.507
<i>I know i stepped out of the box</i>
<i>when i started dating dave,</i>

00:41.509 --> 00:42.908
<i>But honestly i thought</i>

00:42.910 --> 00:44.643
<i>I needed to shake things up</i>
<i>even more.</i>

00:44.645 --> 00:45.844
<i>I mean, everyone's always</i>
<i>saying</i>

00:45.846 --> 00:48.080
<i>Change is a good thing, right?</i>

00:48.082 --> 00:49.515
<i>So i stopped gelling my hair.</i>

00:49.517 --> 00:51.750
Terrorist!

00:53.254 --> 00:54.586
<i>I even stopped</i>
<i>wearing bow ties.</i>

00:54.588 --> 00:55.921
Hey.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.689
It's me.
It's blaine.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.525
Look, bro, okay, i don't
care what your name is.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.060
I'm not into
that stuff.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.728
Blaine:
<i>It was that moment</i>

01:02.730 --> 01:05.397
<i>I realized that</i>
<i>i didn't need to change it up.</i>

01:05.399 --> 01:07.366
<i>I had to get back</i>
<i>to where i once belonged,</i>

01:07.368 --> 01:10.235
<i>And that's dalton academy,</i>
<i>where no matter what happens,</i>

01:10.237 --> 01:11.937
<i>You can always</i>
<i>count on the fact</i>

01:11.939 --> 01:14.039
<i>That nothing's</i>
<i>ever gonna change.</i>

01:14.041 --> 01:15.074
Excuse me.

01:15.076 --> 01:17.509
Can i help you?

01:17.511 --> 01:18.944
You're mr. Anderson, right?

01:18.946 --> 01:20.079
Um, my name's jane.

01:20.081 --> 01:21.246
I'm... New to dalton.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.682
Uh... What do you mean?

01:23.684 --> 01:24.850
You're a girl.

01:24.852 --> 01:25.784
My dad went to dalton.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.019
And two of
my uncles.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.253
That's nice.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.855
But then here i was,
stuck at one of

01:29.857 --> 01:31.390
The lowest-performing
public schools in ohio,

01:31.392 --> 01:33.092
With no arts, no music.

01:33.094 --> 01:35.761
So my parents brought a title ix
lawsuit against dalton academy

01:35.763 --> 01:36.862
And won.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.030
That's shocking.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.899
I mean, that's-that's amazing.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.434
Thanks, that's nice to hear.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.203
Anyway, i talked to
the dean of performing arts,

01:44.205 --> 01:45.971
And he said i should
talk to you.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.372
I want to be a warbler.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.414
Attention, mckinley idiots.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.982
It's homecoming week,

01:56.984 --> 01:59.151
Which means that
a bunch of old farts

01:59.153 --> 02:00.652
Will be creeping
around the hallways

02:00.654 --> 02:02.421
Like<i> game of throne</i>
white walkers...

02:02.423 --> 02:03.589
Did you hear?

02:03.591 --> 02:05.724
The glee club is back!

02:05.726 --> 02:07.092
...Horrifying you
with their beer bellies

02:07.094 --> 02:08.961
And their liver spots.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.896
And that's just
the class of 2012.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.798
The sign-up sheet
is right over here.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.333
Sue:
Fyi,

02:14.335 --> 02:17.603
The much-beloved mckinley high
homecoming dance

02:17.605 --> 02:19.972
Is canceled, due to...

02:19.974 --> 02:21.907
Uh, let's say sharia law.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.312
Ima loser.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.481
(gasps)

02:30.518 --> 02:32.951
(cup clatters on floor)

02:32.953 --> 02:34.520
(school bell ringing)

02:34.522 --> 02:37.789
I mean, honestly, i forgot
how cold those slushees are.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.424
They chill you
to the bone!

02:39.426 --> 02:40.826
I'm so sorry that
happened, rachel.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.427
All right, guys,
dinner is served.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.630
You know what, though?
It didn't really bother me.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.431
It's like i felt good
being an underdog again,

02:46.433 --> 02:48.367
Like i was getting back
to my mckinley roots.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.035
All that from getting
slusheed in the face?

02:50.037 --> 02:51.803
Well, i guess becky
did you a solid.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.205
Well, i don't know.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.439
Uh, wait, so you two
are codirecting, then?

02:54.441 --> 02:56.208
Yes.
Not really.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.110
Well, i guess we haven't come
around to that conversation yet.

02:58.112 --> 03:00.279
We're just focusing on
recruiting right now, so...

03:00.281 --> 03:01.346
Oh, uh...
(doorbell rings)

03:01.348 --> 03:03.448
Oh.
Oh, guess that's blaine.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.317
(door opens)
will:
Oh, hey, buddy.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.351
Come on in.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.619
Blaine:
Hey, everybody.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.321
Oh, my god, you
will not believe

03:09.323 --> 03:10.522
The day that
i just had.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.823
Sorry i'm late.

03:11.825 --> 03:12.991
What did i miss?
Will:
Uh, not much,

03:12.993 --> 03:14.393
But since i have you all here,

03:14.395 --> 03:15.561
We might as well get started.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.229
Rachel:
Mm-hmm.
(clears throat)

03:17.231 --> 03:19.164
We have some fierce show choir
competition ahead of us,

03:19.166 --> 03:21.466
And, uh, i think we should
lay down some ground rules.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.735
Yes. Uh, like no stealing
each other's set lists

03:23.737 --> 03:24.903
And no spying.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.371
And no poaching.
Mm-hmm.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.573
And always be supportive
and clap for each other,

03:27.575 --> 03:29.041
No matter what.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.509
I actually really,
really need everyone's advice.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.878
I have a huge dilemma.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.347
A girl wants
to join the warblers.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.882
What's the dilemma?

03:36.884 --> 03:38.917
You cannot be on the wrong
side of history here.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.519
I mean, you of all people
should know that.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.054
Well, i know, i just think

03:42.056 --> 03:43.488
That tradition
is important, too,

03:43.490 --> 03:44.890
You know?
Yeah, well,

03:44.892 --> 03:46.191
Some traditions
are meant to be broken.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.227
You have to let
her try out.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.395
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

03:55.436 --> 03:58.003
A house divided against itself
cannot stand.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.706
This house is built
on a foundation of lies.

04:00.708 --> 04:01.873
The warblers

04:01.875 --> 04:02.874
Is a house of lies!

04:02.876 --> 04:05.010
(all arguing loudly)

04:05.012 --> 04:06.245
Order!

04:06.247 --> 04:07.346
Blaine:
Look, look.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.580
No decision has been made yet.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.282
I'm just presenting
the issue

04:10.284 --> 04:12.351
For the warbler
council to discuss.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.886
Should female students
be allowed to join?

04:14.888 --> 04:17.256
(all arguing loudly)

04:17.258 --> 04:18.590
You know, okay.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.725
What's next, huh?

04:19.727 --> 04:21.026
Cat and dog warblers?

04:21.028 --> 04:22.461
I mean, the
very question

04:22.463 --> 04:23.695
Is risible.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.230
How about a student
who's a skunk?

04:25.232 --> 04:27.032
Should it be allowed
to become a warbler?

04:27.034 --> 04:29.468
We can't have a girl warbler.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.036
Imagine the sexual tension.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.704
We would never
get anything done.

04:32.706 --> 04:35.107
But, uh, aren't
most of you guys gay?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.041
How dare you?!

04:36.043 --> 04:38.043
(warblers exclaiming)

04:38.912 --> 04:39.978
I have a girlfriend.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.813
We all have girlfriends.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.582
Really?
Warblers:
Yes!

04:43.584 --> 04:45.384
(clamoring)

04:46.787 --> 04:48.420
Order. Order.

04:48.422 --> 04:51.757
Warblers, as coach,
i am a non-voting member

04:51.759 --> 04:54.760
Of this body,
and once a vote is cast,

04:54.762 --> 04:56.762
I will respect
the council's decision.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.298
But let's be on the right side
of history here.

04:59.300 --> 05:03.468
Dr. King-- he said that the arc
of the moral universe

05:03.470 --> 05:05.304
Bends toward justice, and...

05:05.306 --> 05:08.240
Isn't justice all about

05:08.242 --> 05:10.242
Equal rights
and equal opportunity

05:10.244 --> 05:11.276
And inclusion?
I mean...

05:11.278 --> 05:12.611
What about squirrels?

05:12.613 --> 05:14.112
(laughing):
I mean,

05:14.114 --> 05:15.947
Should squirrels be allowed
to join the warblers?

05:15.949 --> 05:17.983
Th-the very premise
of your argument

05:17.985 --> 05:18.850
Is laughable.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.818
Warbler:
So is yours!

05:19.820 --> 05:22.821
(all arguing loudly)

05:24.458 --> 05:25.590
Order! Order.

05:25.592 --> 05:26.658
Thank you, gentlemen,

05:26.660 --> 05:29.695
For that... High-minded debate.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.998
As head warbler, i'd like
to propose a compromise.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.033
Why take the unprecedented step
of amending

05:35.035 --> 05:37.269
The warbler constitution
when we may not even need to?

05:37.271 --> 05:41.340
We may be allowed to refuse
entry based on gender.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.674
And we may not.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.675
That's an open question.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.210
But what is not in question

05:45.212 --> 05:48.780
Is our right to refuse entry
based on talent.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.450
What i'm saying is,
shouldn't we first find out

05:51.452 --> 05:52.484
If she can even sing?

05:52.486 --> 05:54.686
Hmm?

05:54.688 --> 05:55.987
All those in favor?

05:55.989 --> 06:00.158
(singing in harmony):
¶ aye. ¶

06:00.160 --> 06:02.861
Kurt: Well, i never agreed
to be your assistant.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.663
I'm just saying, cochair seems
a little more fair.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.198
Yeah? Well, you never
would have thought

06:06.200 --> 06:07.666
To do your work-study program
here at mckinley

06:07.668 --> 06:09.334
If i wasn't here
in the first place.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.303
Okay. Well, let just hold off
on the whole labels issue

06:11.305 --> 06:13.138
Until we actually have
a glee club to lead.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.639
Fine.
Where did you put

06:14.641 --> 06:16.541
"we both reached for the gun"
from<i> chicago?</i>

06:16.543 --> 06:18.710
1975 to 1980.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.512
You organized them
chronologically?

06:20.514 --> 06:21.413
Yes.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.647
(sighs)

06:22.649 --> 06:24.149
Wait a minute.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.218
What does<i> xanadu</i> have to do
with ace of base?

06:26.220 --> 06:28.019
I'm filing them
based on emotion,

06:28.021 --> 06:29.888
As we always should
have filed them.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.723
All right, this pile
is divas strike back

06:31.725 --> 06:33.525
And that pile is
cherish yourself

06:33.527 --> 06:35.360
And that pile right
there is makeovers,

06:35.362 --> 06:36.895
'cause we always tend to
love a good makeover.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.330
Great. Well, we just
wasted the past two hours,

06:38.332 --> 06:39.865
And now we have to start over
all over again.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.067
Okay, there is no point
in organizing sheet music

06:42.069 --> 06:43.769
If we don't have
any members.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.337
Rachel, you've got
to get more proactive

06:45.339 --> 06:46.905
If you expect this to work.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.040
Okay, you can't just
post a sign-up sheet

06:49.042 --> 06:51.109
And-and expect people
to sign up, like mr. Shue did.

06:51.111 --> 06:53.078
Mckinley has changed.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.380
Sue has got these kids thinking
the arts don't even exist.

06:55.382 --> 06:58.183
We have got to show them
that glee is possible.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.818
I'll be in the auditorium.

07:01.688 --> 07:04.389
Male voice: ¶ can you hear me
now, can you hear me now? ¶

07:04.391 --> 07:07.893
¶ i'm singing out
as loud as i know how ¶

07:07.895 --> 07:12.297
¶ am i loud enough? ¶

07:12.299 --> 07:15.967
¶ i've got my voice
and you've got yours ¶

07:15.969 --> 07:18.937
¶ so let's make a little noise ¶

07:18.939 --> 07:22.541
¶ oh, all together now... ¶

07:22.543 --> 07:24.075
Whoa!

07:24.077 --> 07:27.546
I promise i am not looking
at anyone or anything.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.914
I just am looking...

07:28.916 --> 07:31.316
Don't worry. Sorry, guys.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.884
And...

07:32.886 --> 07:34.486
¶ oh... ¶

07:34.488 --> 07:37.756
¶ can you hear me now,
can you hear me now? ¶

07:37.758 --> 07:41.560
¶ i'm singing out
as loud as i know how... ¶

07:41.562 --> 07:43.795
Oh, my god, sam,
you hear it, too?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.297
Yeah, is it like
a high-pitched ringing

07:45.299 --> 07:46.631
But only in
your left ear?

07:46.633 --> 07:48.333
Because yes, i do,
all the time.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.402
I never wanted mr. Shue to know
because he's like god to me,

07:50.404 --> 07:52.003
But now that you know,
i feel like i can tell you

07:52.005 --> 07:53.171
All this stuff that
i've been holding...
Shh!

07:53.173 --> 07:55.407
I hear it now.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.910
I swear i heard it.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.178
I know it's true.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.646
Yeah.
No, i believe you, rachel.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.683
I mean, doctors won't,
but i believe you.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.918
(school bell ringing)

08:07.921 --> 08:10.689
Found the god mic.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.662
Okay, i know things got
a little crazy earlier,

08:17.664 --> 08:19.698
And we both said some things
about your life

08:19.700 --> 08:21.266
That weren't
very nice, so...

08:21.268 --> 08:22.767
Mostly me.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.369
Wait, why are you smiling?

08:24.371 --> 08:25.937
'cause you were right.

08:25.939 --> 08:29.174
About me hiding in here
and not being proactive.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.176
But when you left yesterday,
i had an epiphany

08:31.178 --> 08:33.211
And i heard a voice.
Y-you found a student?

08:33.213 --> 08:35.313
Well, not exactly, but
i heard him. At least
i think it's a him.

08:35.315 --> 08:36.848
Well, let's not label or judge.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.950
The point is,
is that you were right.

08:38.952 --> 08:39.951
About everything.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.653
They're out there.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.855
They're here right now in
mckinley, hiding in plain sight.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.358
They just need something huge
to draw them out,

08:46.360 --> 08:47.492
To show them what they could be.

08:47.494 --> 08:48.660
Uh-huh.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.961
So i got on the phone.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.197
With who?

08:52.199 --> 08:53.798
With everyone!

08:53.800 --> 08:55.667
Mercedes:
Surprise!

08:55.669 --> 08:56.968
(giggles)

08:56.970 --> 08:58.136
Yay!

08:58.906 --> 09:00.639
(laughs)
let's go say hi.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.876
Artie:
What's up?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.912
Rachel:
Hi, guys!

09:12.085 --> 09:13.351
Puck:
Welcome back.
Quinn: Hey.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.986
Hi!

09:14.988 --> 09:16.788
(excited chatter)

09:18.158 --> 09:22.027
Now the whole gang is back
to reboot the glee club.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.562
Damn it, you guys,
you said you'd wait for me

09:23.564 --> 09:25.597
To park
the rental car!
All: Oh...

09:25.599 --> 09:28.266
All:
Tina! Tina!

09:28.268 --> 09:29.501
Come on!
Come over here.

09:29.503 --> 09:30.702
Let's go.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.103
All (chanting):
Tina, tina, tina,

09:32.105 --> 09:34.039
Tina, tina, tina...
Sam:
Come on, tina!

09:34.041 --> 09:37.375
...Tina, tina, tina, tina...

09:37.377 --> 09:39.177
Yay, group hug!

09:39.179 --> 09:41.713
Are you still
a virgin?

09:41.715 --> 09:43.014
Sam...

09:43.016 --> 09:44.182
Hugs, everybody!

09:49.456 --> 09:50.855
(school bell ringing)

09:50.857 --> 09:52.524
It's so great to have
you all together

09:52.526 --> 09:53.925
In this room again.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.893
It means so much to us
that you would come

09:54.895 --> 09:55.860
At the drop of a hat.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.128
Artie, are you
drawing me?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.763
Nope, just your boobs.
Hmm.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.699
I'm practicing for my
storyboarding class.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.133
Okay, we need to focus.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.435
Yeah, guys, we really got
to focus here, okay?

10:03.437 --> 10:04.636
W-we're in crisis mode,
all right?

10:04.638 --> 10:06.037
Glee club has done so
much for all of us.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.472
You know? It brought
us together,

10:07.474 --> 10:09.374
It-it gave us hope, it
put us out in the world.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.408
And it brought
some of us home again.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.576
She's talking
about me.

10:11.578 --> 10:12.944
Here's the situation.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.579
We need you guys back--
not all the time,

10:14.581 --> 10:16.281
We realize that you have lives
in other places.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.216
We've got to get glee club
back on its feet, you know?

10:18.218 --> 10:20.819
Especially since now some
of us are the competition.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.220
He's talking about
shue and blaine.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.321
We need you back.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.456
Not all the time,

10:24.458 --> 10:26.224
But if you're not here,

10:26.226 --> 10:28.059
Then the tradition of the club
we love so much will be gone.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.161
So we're going to find kids
that can bring something to it

10:30.163 --> 10:31.630
The same way that we did,

10:31.632 --> 10:32.831
And we will mentor them
based on our strengths.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.332
Kurt: But right now
we really got

10:34.334 --> 10:35.567
To get out there
and take on the school.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.102
You know, really
rattle sue's cage.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.937
We are going
to give mckinley

10:38.939 --> 10:41.573
A little taste of what
they've been missing.

10:41.575 --> 10:44.142

(song ends)

13:06.987 --> 13:08.286
(school bell ringing)

13:08.288 --> 13:09.988
Boy:
<i>Did you hear the joke</i>

13:09.990 --> 13:12.290
<i>About the fat kid</i>
<i>who always wears headphones?</i>

13:12.292 --> 13:14.626
<i>He wears them</i>
<i>so he doesn't have to hear</i>

13:14.628 --> 13:16.127
<i>Your lame-ass fat jokes.</i>

13:16.129 --> 13:19.397
<i>'cause, believe me,</i>
<i>i've heard them all.</i>

13:19.399 --> 13:21.766
<i>And this is my senior year.</i>

13:21.768 --> 13:24.068
<i>It's supposed to be</i>
<i>the best year of my life,</i>

13:24.070 --> 13:27.071
<i>But instead i'm a no-name</i>
<i>transfer from chicago,</i>

13:27.073 --> 13:29.574
<i>And not one of these</i>
<i>mckinley douche bags</i>

13:29.576 --> 13:32.177
<i>Has bothered to talk to me.</i>

13:32.179 --> 13:33.778
<i>Whatever.</i>

13:33.780 --> 13:35.446
<i>Who needs them?</i>

13:35.448 --> 13:38.783
<i>I've got my boys: Tupac,</i>
<i>hendrix, jagger, sinatra.</i>

13:38.785 --> 13:41.252
<i>Music might be my only friend,</i>

13:41.254 --> 13:44.088
<i>But it's the only friend</i>
<i>that i need.</i>

13:44.090 --> 13:45.790
<i>Still...</i>

13:45.792 --> 13:48.426
<i>Wouldn't kill me</i>
<i>to meet some people here.</i>

13:48.428 --> 13:50.762
<i>Maybe make some friends?</i>

13:50.764 --> 13:53.364
<i>Some real friends.</i>

13:53.366 --> 13:54.833
(muffled, indistinct talking)

13:54.835 --> 13:56.334
I'm sorry, what?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.669
Are you thinking of trying out
for the glee club?

13:57.671 --> 13:59.137
I-i just saw the...
Fantastic.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.272
I'm rachel berry,
and i'm rebooting mckinley's

14:01.274 --> 14:03.474
Award-winning new directions!
With my best friend kurt hummel.

14:03.476 --> 14:05.043
You may have heard of us.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.544
We're taking a break from
our showbiz careers right now

14:06.546 --> 14:07.879
Just to give back
to the community.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.180
I'm so sorry.
I didn't even ask your name.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.815
Uh, roderick.
Okay, roderick,

14:10.817 --> 14:12.183
So auditions are next week,
and we're asking everyone

14:12.185 --> 14:13.718
To prepare an up-tempo song
and a ballad.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.719
Do you have any favorites?

14:14.721 --> 14:16.287
I...
Fantastic.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.522
Okay, so i would pick
something not too obscure--

14:17.524 --> 14:18.823
Like "corner of the sky"
from<i> pippin.</i>

14:18.825 --> 14:20.291
Isn't that, like,
the best song ever?

14:20.293 --> 14:21.659
And then i would pick
something not too popular.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.294
Try not to stay within,
like, two minutes.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.897
And if i were you, i would do,
like, 16 to 32 bars.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.399
Here's some sheet music for...
Uh, listen, i... I'm sorry.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.468
I-i'm really busy
after school

14:30.470 --> 14:31.736
With everything, so...

14:31.738 --> 14:33.805
Okay, are you sure?
Thank you.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.807
It was nice meeting you.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.376
Nice going, berry.
You scared him off.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.715
Jane, wait up. Wait.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.083
The warbler council
has decided

14:45.085 --> 14:47.018
To let you come in
and sing for them.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.653
They want to see
how talented you are

14:48.655 --> 14:49.921
Before they decide to overturn

14:49.923 --> 14:51.389
A 100-year-old
males-only policy.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.991
Let me get this straight.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.360
I have to go in there
and perform for the warblers

14:55.362 --> 14:57.028
Just to make sure
i'm good enough

14:57.030 --> 14:58.830
To warrant them taking
a closer look at their already

14:58.832 --> 15:01.733
Sexist and discriminatory
admission policies?

15:01.735 --> 15:03.334
Yeah.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.737
Hey, jane, jane, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.205
Just-just listen to me.

15:07.207 --> 15:10.341
Look, the warblers are
a very old organization.

15:10.343 --> 15:13.011
I mean, they've been around
since the war of 1812.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.915
When francis scott key sang
"the star-spangled banner"

15:16.917 --> 15:19.050
To an ailing
president william henry harrison

15:19.052 --> 15:22.420
On his death bed,
the warblers hummed behind him.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.455
The point
that i'm trying to make

15:24.457 --> 15:26.758
Is that sometimes change
is scary,

15:26.760 --> 15:28.893
Even when it doesn't seem
all that significant,

15:28.895 --> 15:30.361
And i'm telling you,

15:30.363 --> 15:31.896
It would mean so much to me--

15:31.898 --> 15:33.932
And-and it could mean
so much to the warblers--

15:33.934 --> 15:36.868
If you'd just...
If you could swallow your pride,

15:36.870 --> 15:38.870
Come in and show us
what you got.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.039
And before you do,

15:41.041 --> 15:43.641
There is someone
i want you to meet.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.244
Jane, meet rachel berry,

15:46.246 --> 15:47.979
The greatest performer

15:47.981 --> 15:49.414
I have ever known.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.982
Ms. Berry, it's so nice
to actually meet you.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.583
You're a legend.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.118
Yeah, well, that's not
the general opinion these days,

15:54.120 --> 15:55.653
But thank you--
it's an honor to help.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.289
I think you are in the
best possible hands.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.824
My work is done here,

15:59.826 --> 16:02.093
And i think i should leave
you two ladies alone.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.861
All right.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.765
Um... Can i say something?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.233
Why are you helping me?

16:09.235 --> 16:10.668
Oh, well, look.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.603
We might be mortal
show-choir enemies,

16:12.605 --> 16:14.806
But i'm a woman
before all of that,

16:14.808 --> 16:17.442
And i figure you're fighting
this fight for all of us girls,

16:17.444 --> 16:19.344
So... Let's get started.

16:19.346 --> 16:20.778
Okay.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.080
Center stage.

16:22.916 --> 16:23.982
(snaps fingers)

16:23.984 --> 16:25.283
All right.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.251
It's a packed house.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.253
Show me your presence.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.722
(takes deep breath)

16:31.624 --> 16:34.258
Okay, keep your back straight.

16:34.260 --> 16:38.830
You have to command the audience
with your body language.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.498
Keep your head up.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.667
And make eye contact.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.536
Even if there's
a hundred people out there,

16:45.538 --> 16:47.171
You have to make
a personal connection.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.340
You have to
make each person feel

16:49.342 --> 16:51.509
Like they have a one-on-one
connection with you.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.112
And, most important,

16:54.114 --> 16:55.780
Your song.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.549
Well, my family has a tradition

16:58.551 --> 17:00.685
Of singing "up, up and away,"
which is bad because...

17:00.687 --> 17:02.720
Let me see your phone.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.160
Oh, it... Well...
(chuckles)

17:09.162 --> 17:11.195
Janelle monáe's "tightrope"
has the most plays.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.297
Oh, my god, that...
She's incredible.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.102
Well, i think you found
your audition song.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.640
Oh.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.908
Okay.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.777
From the top.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.881
Kurt:
Hey. I'm open.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.820
I guess that's
why i was the kicker.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.322
Which was
a transformational moment

17:38.324 --> 17:40.658
For the school, by the way.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.361
Yeah, marked the beginning
of a great synchronicity

17:43.363 --> 17:45.163
Between glee club and football.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.998
Just ask any of
the-the football guys

17:47.000 --> 17:48.032
That are back
for homecoming.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.233
So, why aren't they here

17:49.235 --> 17:50.535
Trying to recruit me?

17:50.537 --> 17:52.270
Why'd they send you?

17:52.272 --> 17:54.572
'cause we both like guys?

17:56.242 --> 17:59.043
Look, i know we don't have
much else in common,

17:59.045 --> 18:00.778
But only a gay man

18:00.780 --> 18:02.346
Knows what it's like
for us out there.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.515
I know, when you were
in high school,

18:04.517 --> 18:07.018
Being gay was how you
primarily identified yourself,

18:07.020 --> 18:08.686
But that's not my thing.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.255
But don't you think it's
everyone else's thing?

18:11.257 --> 18:13.057
When i told people i was gay,

18:13.059 --> 18:14.892
Only two people
had a problem with it.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.427
Coach beiste
kicked them off the team.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.629
Look, you're-you're naive
if you don't think

18:18.631 --> 18:19.964
You're standing
on our shoulders.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.365
Okay, you owe glee club.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.935
Please. I owe<i> modern family.</i>

18:25.438 --> 18:27.305
Listen, when coach beiste
kicked those guys off the team,

18:27.307 --> 18:28.906
They cornered me
in the parking lot

18:28.908 --> 18:30.408
When i was getting into my car.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.943
Got all up in my face.

18:31.945 --> 18:34.212
One of them ended the day
with his jaw wired shut,

18:34.214 --> 18:36.948
And the other... I don't think
he ever stopped running.

18:36.950 --> 18:40.718
I can't stand gaga,
i've never seen<i> newsies,</i>

18:40.720 --> 18:42.920
And i don't write
<i>archie</i> fan fiction

18:42.922 --> 18:45.389
Where archie and jughead
are hot for each other.

18:45.391 --> 18:48.126
Just because you and i
happened to be born in the same

18:48.128 --> 18:50.495
Ten percent of the population
that would choose

18:50.497 --> 18:52.263
Andrew garfield over emma stone

18:52.265 --> 18:54.565
Doesn't mean we have
anything else in common.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.734
So, i'm not saying no
to your glee club

18:56.736 --> 18:59.103
Because it's gay or straight;

18:59.105 --> 19:02.607
I'm saying no
because i think it sucks.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.042
I'm sorry, man.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.314
(sighs)

19:12.118 --> 19:14.318
(phone vibrates)

19:21.094 --> 19:22.827
Ready?

19:24.797 --> 19:26.964
(takes deep breath)

19:26.966 --> 19:29.800
Distinguished councilmen,
fellow warblers,

19:29.802 --> 19:31.536
May i present...

19:31.538 --> 19:33.638
Jane heyward.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.907
(janelle monáe's
"tightrope" begins)

19:36.709 --> 19:40.144
¶ oh... ¶

19:40.146 --> 19:41.779
¶ some people talk about you ¶

19:41.781 --> 19:43.147
¶ like they know all about you ¶

¶ while they jumpin' round you ¶

19:58.865 --> 20:00.698

20:02.235 --> 20:04.635

¶ i tip on alligators

20:17.217 --> 20:20.017
¶ but i'm another flavor,
something like a terminator ¶

20:20.019 --> 20:21.485
¶ ain't no equivocating ¶

20:21.487 --> 20:23.154
¶ i fight for what i believe ¶

¶ tightrope ¶

21:41.434 --> 21:47.138
¶ oh, yeah, yeah, ooh. ¶

21:47.140 --> 21:50.875
(whooping, applause,
excited chatter)

21:57.517 --> 21:59.750
(school bell ringing,
gavel banging)

21:59.752 --> 22:01.852
Tea party patriot club
has now come to order.

22:01.854 --> 22:04.522
First order of business:
Protecting mckinley's borders.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.357
Puck:
Attention!

22:06.359 --> 22:08.492
At ease, teabaggers.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.927
I'm airman first class
noah puckerman.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.162
But you can call me sir.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.830
Quinn:
When we went to mckinley,

22:12.832 --> 22:14.832
We were part
of conservative clubs as well,

22:14.834 --> 22:17.001
Such as the celibacy club
and the god squad.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.636
Most of you guys are
christians, right?

22:18.638 --> 22:20.037
We're all christian.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.706
Before i joined glee club,

22:21.708 --> 22:23.674
I only hung out with people
that were exactly like me.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.142
And then puck
got her pregnant,

22:25.144 --> 22:27.011
And she sort of changed
for the better.

22:27.013 --> 22:30.548
Point is, nerds, you need to
take the three-cornered hats

22:30.550 --> 22:33.784
Out of your loser butts
and join the new directions!

22:33.786 --> 22:35.820
They'll take anybody. Even you.

22:35.822 --> 22:38.723
Sir, i was brought up
to respect my elders.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.791
But don't
call us losers.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.694
The tea party patriots is
mckinley's most popular club.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.364
Oh, my god, that's horrible.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.299
What is happening to america?!

22:48.301 --> 22:50.334
I'll tell you what's happened.

22:50.336 --> 22:52.803
We've grown up in the
biggest economic depression

22:52.805 --> 22:54.171
Since the 1930s.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.374
Our mission is to fix the mess

22:56.376 --> 22:58.075
That barack hussein obama
created

22:58.077 --> 23:00.378
Before he and the homo-elite

23:00.380 --> 23:02.747
Turn this country
into a muslim welfare state.

23:02.749 --> 23:03.981
Oh, no.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.817
Oh, hell to the no.
You know what?

23:06.819 --> 23:09.086
Don't you, you or you

23:09.088 --> 23:10.721
Join the glee club.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.556
'cause, you know, we don't need
you ignorant, backwards,

23:12.558 --> 23:17.428
Lily-white, gay-hating,
obama-bashing clubbers anyway.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.396
Nope.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.167
I will be taking these.

23:23.836 --> 23:24.835
Yeah.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.203
And you know what?

23:26.205 --> 23:29.573
Quinn once had sex
with a latina lesbian.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.208
Ooh.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.209
(grunts)

23:32.211 --> 23:33.677
Learned that in glee club.

23:33.679 --> 23:35.279
My bad.

23:35.281 --> 23:36.280
(laughing)

23:36.282 --> 23:37.882
(gavel banging)
order.

23:37.884 --> 23:38.849
Order!

23:38.851 --> 23:40.518
Order.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.753
(school bell ringing)

23:55.435 --> 23:57.835
The warbler council
voted against you.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.572
They saw how
talented you are,

24:01.574 --> 24:05.443
But they're a brotherhood, and
they voted to keep it that way.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.917
What am i gonna tell my dad?

24:12.919 --> 24:15.953
You are gonna tell him that
we are not giving up on you,

24:15.955 --> 24:18.322
Because i am going straight
to the dalton board of directors

24:18.324 --> 24:20.624
And telling them
that i am not interested

24:20.626 --> 24:22.827
In coaching the warblers
if you're not one of them.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.830
So you're going
to threaten to resign

24:25.832 --> 24:30.067
So i can join a club
where nobody wants me?

24:30.069 --> 24:32.636
Yeah.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.406
Yeah, because this is wrong.

24:35.408 --> 24:37.007
This is wrong.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.009
And sometimes, if you
want to make change,

24:39.011 --> 24:41.679
You-you got to make
a little noise.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.448
I can fix this.

24:44.450 --> 24:47.685
I just need
a little time.

24:50.490 --> 24:52.590
Okay, just remember,
sex sells.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.258
That's true,
that's how lady tubbington got

24:54.260 --> 24:55.860
Lord tubbington caught up
in a ponzi scheme.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.761

¶ problem, yeah. ¶

27:02.221 --> 27:03.554
(cheering)

27:07.226 --> 27:09.460
You guys got some great moves.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.395
We could really use some of that
in the glee club.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.831
Yeah, you could.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.966
Oh, hi, artie.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.501
Kitty, wh-where have you been?

27:17.503 --> 27:19.503
I thought sue made
all the new directions! Transfer

27:19.505 --> 27:21.972
Out of mckinley.
We need you back.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.807
You really think
i'm gonna come back

27:23.809 --> 27:25.309
And help you
and your stupid glee club

27:25.311 --> 27:26.844
After the way
you treated all of us?

27:26.846 --> 27:30.180
The way you treated me
when you went away to college?

27:30.182 --> 27:32.616
Sue didn't make me
transfer

27:32.618 --> 27:34.118
Because she's smart enough
to recognize

27:34.120 --> 27:36.120
A star player
when she sees one.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.856
Unlike rachel berry, who never
even knew any of our names.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.357
(scoffs) i know your
name, it's quinn.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.859
(scoffs)
i'm quinn.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.327
Liar.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.695
Listen, don't you guys
want to do more

27:44.697 --> 27:45.996
Than just get shot
out of cannons?

27:45.998 --> 27:47.264
Don't you want to be a star?

27:47.266 --> 27:50.300
Oh, that is rich
coming from you,

27:50.302 --> 27:54.038
Pathetically stuffed back into
your cheerios! Uniforms again.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.106
Both:
Can two people try out together?

27:56.108 --> 27:58.042
Yes.
Yep.
Yeah, i don't
see why not.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.510
The three of us
tried out together.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.645
Of course
the incest twins want in.

28:01.647 --> 28:02.946
Let's go, ladies.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.882
We have to explain
to these two again

28:04.884 --> 28:08.786
Why<i> flowers in the attic</i> is
not a love story to aspire to.

28:18.664 --> 28:20.998
(school bell ringing)
if you really want
to get blaine back,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.633
Here's what you do.

28:22.635 --> 28:24.501
First, promise him you're
gonna burn all your clothing,

28:24.503 --> 28:25.969
And then tell him

28:25.971 --> 28:27.671
You're gonna start dressing
like a normal person.

28:27.673 --> 28:29.373
Then i think you should really
start getting honest with him

28:29.375 --> 28:31.075
About following
your life's ambition,

28:31.077 --> 28:32.676
Which is becoming america's
top barbara bush impersonator.

28:32.678 --> 28:34.578
That's not my
life's ambition.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.413
(laughing):
That's hilarious.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.881
Rachel:
Okay, guys, progress report.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.317
How's it going with
the new recruits?

28:40.319 --> 28:41.251
Horrible.

28:41.253 --> 28:42.486
It ain't working.

28:42.488 --> 28:43.987
Mercedes:
It's not good, rachel.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.823
Glee club has fallen
so far at this school,

28:45.825 --> 28:47.391
We're not gonna be able
to get anyone to join.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.526
Male voice:
¶ i'm singing out... ¶

28:49.528 --> 28:51.995
There's the voice again.

28:51.997 --> 28:56.734
¶ am i loud enough? ¶

28:56.736 --> 29:00.204
¶ oh... ¶

29:00.206 --> 29:01.839
Dudes, he's in the showers
in the locker room.

29:01.841 --> 29:02.740
They're always in the showers.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.074
All:
Shh!

29:04.076 --> 29:06.343
¶ oh... ¶

29:06.345 --> 29:09.546
¶ can you hear me now,
can you hear me now? ¶

29:09.548 --> 29:13.917
¶ i'm singing out
as loud as i know how ¶

29:13.919 --> 29:17.554
¶ am i loud enough? ¶

29:17.556 --> 29:19.790
¶ o-oh... Oh... ¶

29:25.097 --> 29:26.597
(music playing faintly
over headphones)

29:26.599 --> 29:27.898
Oh, god.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.700
Are you guys gonna beat me up?

29:29.702 --> 29:31.969
'cause i just need a second
to get in the fetal position...

29:31.971 --> 29:34.271
No, no, we...
We heard you singing.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.739
Yeah, you're amazing.

29:35.741 --> 29:37.608
Dude, you've got to audition
for the glee club.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.811
So people can make fun of me
more than they already do?

29:40.813 --> 29:43.113
Even the principal calls me
white precious.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.248
(chuckles)

29:44.250 --> 29:45.983
Come here,
you are precious.

29:45.985 --> 29:49.953
Well, all anybody cares about in
glee club is the way you sing.

29:49.955 --> 29:53.157
Look, no one has signed up
for your club yet, right?

29:53.159 --> 29:56.493
Okay. Well, having me
as your first member

29:56.495 --> 29:59.096
Is just gonna drive kids
away even more.

29:59.098 --> 30:02.666
I have designed my entire life
around people not noticing me.

30:02.668 --> 30:05.002
Look, no one has wanted
to feel more invisible

30:05.004 --> 30:06.837
Than i have over the past
couple of months.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.505
But when i'm with
these people,

30:08.507 --> 30:10.507
They remind me
of the best parts of myself.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.142
And they would never
make fun of me.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.511
Mm, not to her face,
no way.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.847
You're the poster child
for glee club.

30:16.849 --> 30:19.349
You're why mr. Shue started
the club in the first place.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.419
It's a place
where misfits can fit in.

30:22.421 --> 30:23.754
Will you please try out?

30:23.756 --> 30:26.290
I'm really sorry
that i came on so strong.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.425
But you can sing
whatever you want.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.294
Yeah, i guarantee
you're gonna get in.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.262
Quinn:
Look at all of us.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.097
We're all so different,
and yet there's nothing

30:34.099 --> 30:35.599
That we wouldn't
do for each other.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.434
We're all just
a phone call away.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.304
And that is because we
took a chance on glee club.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.739
And that's something
that you deserve as well.

30:46.612 --> 30:48.879
Sue:
<i>Dear journal,</i>

30:48.881 --> 30:51.949
<i>I am living a nightmare.</i>

30:51.951 --> 30:53.717
<i>Just when i thought</i>

30:53.719 --> 30:56.987
<i>I had finally killed</i>
<i>my white whale,</i>

30:56.989 --> 31:00.858
<i>Vanquished the tone-deaf</i>
<i>pansexual leviathan</i>

31:00.860 --> 31:02.659
<i>That is the mckinley high</i>
<i>glee club,</i>

31:02.661 --> 31:05.729
<i>It returns...</i>

31:05.731 --> 31:08.832
<i>To defile the great musical</i>
<i>heritage of this nation</i>

31:08.834 --> 31:13.337
<i>One execrable mash-up</i>
<i>at a time.</i>

31:13.339 --> 31:15.239
<i>So forlorn am i</i>

31:15.241 --> 31:17.207
<i>That my pakistani doctor</i>
<i>has informed me</i>

31:17.209 --> 31:21.645
<i>That i, sue sylvester, have</i>
<i>developed a duodenal ulcer.</i>

31:21.647 --> 31:23.080
(sighs loudly)

31:23.082 --> 31:25.649
<i>And now i've taken</i>
<i>to drinking a mixture</i>

31:25.651 --> 31:29.553
<i>Of motor oil, bloody mary mix</i>
<i>and bat guano,</i>

31:29.555 --> 31:32.890
<i>Just so i can bleed out</i>
<i>and die.</i>

31:32.892 --> 31:37.094
<i>There must be some way</i>
<i>i can get at that glee club,</i>

31:37.096 --> 31:41.198
<i>Some naive unsuspecting pawn</i>
<i>i can bend to my will</i>

31:41.200 --> 31:45.269
<i>To dismantle that glee club</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

31:47.106 --> 31:48.772
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

31:48.774 --> 31:50.707
<i>That's it.</i>

31:50.709 --> 31:54.711
<i>Oh, journal, once again, you've</i>
<i>given me reason to go on.</i>

31:54.713 --> 31:59.082
<i>Sue sylvester knows who her</i>
<i>shiny new plaything will be.</i>

32:05.391 --> 32:07.224
So let me get
this straight, sue.

32:07.226 --> 32:08.458
Uh, principal sylvester.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.960
You want me to infiltrate
the glee club

32:09.962 --> 32:11.428
And be terrible on purpose

32:11.430 --> 32:13.263
So that everybody gets
demoralized and quits.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.532
It works every time.
(chuckles)

32:15.534 --> 32:18.035
And i'll make it
worth your while.

32:19.872 --> 32:21.104
What's that?

32:21.106 --> 32:23.573
This is a
one-of-a-kind,

32:23.575 --> 32:27.844
Custom-molded
tom brady fleshlight.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.781
Um, no, thank you.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.052
Okay, well...

32:35.054 --> 32:38.288
How about i hook up with
my friends at pfizer

32:38.290 --> 32:40.991
To supply me with
enough antinausea pills

32:40.993 --> 32:42.893
So i can stomach
a conversation

32:42.895 --> 32:46.763
With the lovably
hideous coach beiste

32:46.765 --> 32:49.733
And force her to make you
the starting quarterback.

32:49.735 --> 32:54.004
I'm gonna have to be
really honest with you, sue.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.106
It's, uh, principal sylvester.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.308
First of all, i'm not for sale.

32:58.310 --> 33:01.511
And secondly, if you want
to get rid of the glee club,

33:01.513 --> 33:04.014
You're gonna have to get
better items than that.

33:07.820 --> 33:10.887
Touché, postmodern gay.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.528
(school bell ringing,
students chattering)

33:18.530 --> 33:20.330
(music playing faintly
over headphones)

33:20.332 --> 33:23.300
Hey, uh, can you... Can you
take your headphones off?

33:23.302 --> 33:24.601
It's distracting me.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.536
Uh, actually, i kind of need...

33:26.538 --> 33:27.838
No, it's fine.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.539
It's okay.
You can keep them on.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.008
We get it.

33:31.010 --> 33:32.275
Everyone has
their own security blanket.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.677
We just want to hear you sing.

Thank you.

Why don't we

Okay, you're in!

35:51.450 --> 35:54.684

35:59.791 --> 36:02.192
Loyal subjects,

Homecoming day is upon us,

36:04.196 --> 36:05.962
And i am pleased
to welcome back

36:05.964 --> 36:09.466
One of mckinley high's
most distinguished graduates,

36:09.468 --> 36:11.101
Who will serve as grand marshal

36:11.103 --> 36:13.103
For tonight's activities.

36:13.105 --> 36:15.605
Becky jackson,

36:22.047 --> 36:25.515
Rule number one:
I'm bringing my taser.

36:25.517 --> 36:30.153
I am going to drop anyone who
is not dressed in school colors.

36:30.155 --> 36:31.354
Rule number two:

36:31.356 --> 36:34.724
No making out
under the bleachers.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.626
That's where i'm gonna make out.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.728
Rule number three:

36:38.730 --> 36:41.631
Every student must bring
two books to burn

36:41.633 --> 36:43.466
At the bonfire.

36:43.468 --> 36:45.702
Rule number four...

36:45.704 --> 36:47.704
Okay, that's enough.
Give me the microphone.
Give me the microphone.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.839
Becky: The losing team
will be sacrificed.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.141
Sue:
Okay, that's enough.

36:51.143 --> 36:52.742
Let go of the microphone.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.011
Honey, i'm gonna peel
your fingers off one by one.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.313
Give me the microphone!

36:56.315 --> 36:57.981
Give it to me! (groans)

36:57.983 --> 36:59.849
Oh, there she is.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.885
Come on. You don't want
to be late

37:01.887 --> 37:03.420
For the first official
glee club meeting.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.188
You okay?

37:05.190 --> 37:09.159
Yeah, i was just...
Thinking about mr. Shue.

37:09.161 --> 37:10.760
About how he did it.

37:10.762 --> 37:13.897
About how he turned nothing
into what we became.

37:13.899 --> 37:17.867
As individuals and
a team, as friends.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.003
Well, we can't recreate
what we had,

37:20.005 --> 37:22.439
But we have to be open
to finding something new

37:22.441 --> 37:24.874
Or different or better.
Yes.

37:24.876 --> 37:27.711
So, why don't we just have
the meeting in here?

37:27.713 --> 37:30.213
I mean, since i am
the only member.

37:30.215 --> 37:32.249
First of all, we have
to have the first meeting

37:32.251 --> 37:33.850
In the choir room;
it's tradition.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.453
And second of all,
you're not the only member.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.288
Someone new joined yesterday.
Wait, who?

37:38.290 --> 37:39.389
(door opens)

37:39.391 --> 37:41.358
I cannot believe you did this!

37:41.360 --> 37:43.360
We sat down, we made rules.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.628
No poaching.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.229
It's not poaching.

37:46.231 --> 37:47.430
She came to me.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.132
I don't feel comfortable
with this.

37:49.134 --> 37:50.800
Even if they let me
on the warblers,

37:50.802 --> 37:52.736
I'll be fighting for
every vocal breakout.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.271
Yeah, you'll be fighting
that fight anywhere.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.373
Yeah, but at least here,
it'll be a fair fight.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.941
With the changes
principal sylvester

37:57.943 --> 37:59.709
Has made to the school,
it's academically on par

37:59.711 --> 38:01.244
With any private school
in the state.

38:01.246 --> 38:03.280
My parents are willing
to let me transfer here

38:03.282 --> 38:04.748
If it's what i want.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.650
And besides, what did you
expect me to do?

38:06.652 --> 38:07.884
I mean, say no?

38:07.886 --> 38:09.319
Jane asked me
not to say anything

38:09.321 --> 38:11.121
Until the transfer papers
were through.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.390
I just spent the last two days
threatening to quit my job

38:13.392 --> 38:15.425
In order to convince everyone
to let her in,

38:15.427 --> 38:16.960
And as soon as i did,

38:16.962 --> 38:18.595
She tells me she's leaving
to join your team?

38:18.597 --> 38:20.130
I was humiliated.

38:20.132 --> 38:22.732
Blaine, you have a full team
and god knows how many

38:22.734 --> 38:24.634
Other students at dalton
that would kill to join.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.470
Don't act all cool
and loving about this, kurt.

38:27.472 --> 38:28.805
I'm sure you're very happy

38:28.807 --> 38:30.507
About all of this.
I wouldn't be surprised

38:30.509 --> 38:31.941
If you made this all happen
after seeing you with dave.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.677
Uh, maybe i should just go.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.779
No, it's okay.
No, stay.
No, no, stay.

38:35.781 --> 38:38.114
You're fine.
You should stay and see
what kind of people

38:38.116 --> 38:40.150
Your coaches are.

38:40.152 --> 38:43.153
This whole
friendly competition thing...

38:43.155 --> 38:46.089
It's over.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.967
(school bell ringing)

38:57.969 --> 39:00.837
The new and improved
glee club

39:00.839 --> 39:02.539
Has officially begun.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.274
Introducing our first
two members,

39:04.276 --> 39:05.675
Jane and roderick.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.711
(applause)

39:07.713 --> 39:09.012
(deep voice):
If you build it, they will come.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.280
Well, they'd
better come fast.

39:10.282 --> 39:11.648
I mean, i'm sorry,
but two people?

39:11.650 --> 39:13.883
Santana:
Shut up, tina.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.318
There's actually four.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.387
As per usual, my undeniable
sexual magnetism

39:17.389 --> 39:18.955
Has worked yet again.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.791
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is mason and madison

39:21.793 --> 39:23.226
Mccarthy.

39:23.228 --> 39:24.361
(applause)

39:24.363 --> 39:26.796
Hey, gang.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.398
We're super pumped
there's a glee club again.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.833
Now, i know what
you're thinking.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.668
They can obviously log roll
and kick toss,

39:31.670 --> 39:33.503
But can they sing?

39:33.505 --> 39:35.138
Well, not to toot
our own horns...
Toot!

39:35.140 --> 39:36.740
But we've won karaoke night

39:36.742 --> 39:38.508
At the wapakoneta
summer cheer camp

39:38.510 --> 39:40.510
Every year since we were three.
It's in our blood.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.479
Our parents met
while touring

39:42.481 --> 39:44.814
With the inspirational,
world-famous singing group,

39:44.816 --> 39:46.916
Up with people.

39:46.918 --> 39:49.152
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I think i've made a mistake.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.553
Rachel: No, it's okay.
You're welcome.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.554
I mean, you're gonna have
to audition.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.189
We have a very rigorous process.

39:53.191 --> 39:54.991
I mean, not really. Sugar motta
was literally tone-deaf.

39:54.993 --> 39:56.659
Yeah, but she was hot.

39:56.661 --> 39:58.661
I'm actually really happy.

39:58.663 --> 39:59.696
This is the start

39:59.698 --> 40:01.765
Of something really special.

40:01.767 --> 40:05.368
And i know that most of you
came home just for homecoming

40:05.370 --> 40:07.337
And not for me and kurt,

40:07.339 --> 40:09.906
But we can't tell you how
grateful we are for your help.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.510
Get over here.
(laughs)
let's hug.

40:13.512 --> 40:14.944
Bring it in.
Get in for this.

40:14.946 --> 40:17.080
Come on, bring it in!

40:17.082 --> 40:20.183
Start getting comfortable
with group hugs.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.185
(whistling)

40:22.187 --> 40:24.354
(edward sharpe's "home" begins)

40:29.194 --> 40:30.760

41:27.786 --> 41:29.285
You think this is hard?

41:29.287 --> 41:30.954
Try having sex
with michael bolton

41:30.956 --> 41:33.089
And not fall in love.
That's hard!
