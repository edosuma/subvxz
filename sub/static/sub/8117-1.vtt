01:19.647 --> 01:21.149
Hey, Dad.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.316
Hey, buddy.

01:22.350 --> 01:23.517
What's in the bag?

01:23.551 --> 01:25.286
Uh-uh! What is it? Come on.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.320
What's in the bag?

01:29.990 --> 01:32.760
No way.
Where'd you get it?

01:32.793 --> 01:33.394
Get what?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.863
Dad scored
an orange.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.432
No. From where?

01:38.466 --> 01:41.935
I can't even remember the last
time I saw one of those.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.637
Hey, look, Zoe.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.240
Hey, Zoe.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.808
I can peel it
for her.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.513
Hi. Hey. How was your day?

01:52.546 --> 01:54.882
Missed you.
How was yours?

01:54.915 --> 01:56.284
Great, actually.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.886
Three more patients
with pulmo-replasia.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.589
One was a seven-year-old boy. He
could hardly breathe on his own.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.457
It's getting worse
and worse out there.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.360
Even a rebreather isn't
enough anymore.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.928
Got a little
on your nose.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.997
All right, cool, huh?

02:14.001 --> 02:15.736
They're coming.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.906
I was downstairs and I saw them.
They're on their way now.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.977
Zoe, baby, it's time
to play hideaway, okay?

02:24.011 --> 02:26.146
Okay, come on.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.383
Climb in there for Mommy.
Everything's gonna...

02:34.021 --> 02:36.390
Okay, love you.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.608
Population Control.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.077
You're being investigated
for a possible violation.

02:58.346 --> 03:01.982
Oh, no, there must be
some mistake. Uh...

03:02.015 --> 03:03.984
I'm a cop, too.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.719
Hey!

03:05.753 --> 03:09.290
I need you to step outside
so we can search the premises.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.892
Okay, let's go.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.927
Come on, guys.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.931
It's okay.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.640
Hey, be careful with that!

03:41.989 --> 03:43.424
Hold it!

03:45.092 --> 03:47.461
Mommy!

03:51.164 --> 03:53.734
Mommy!

04:00.408 --> 04:01.342
Come on. Come here.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.944
I'm not playing
around. Come on.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.012
Leave her alone!

04:05.045 --> 04:06.079
Don't touch her!

04:06.113 --> 04:07.113
Jim! Dad! No!

04:07.281 --> 04:08.749
Dad!

04:08.782 --> 04:09.283
Mommy!

04:09.317 --> 04:10.584
Stay back!

04:11.184 --> 04:12.520
Zoe! Dad! Look at Mommy!

04:15.022 --> 04:16.857
Stop! Stop it!

04:16.890 --> 04:18.158
Dad, no!
Jim!

04:22.763 --> 04:24.698
See? Now, you shouldn't have
done that, pal.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.919
Shannon.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.489
You paid
for five minutes.

04:52.159 --> 04:53.627
Oh, my God, Jim.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.302
Elisabeth.
Jim...

05:10.043 --> 05:12.245
Look at you...

05:14.748 --> 05:15.949
Oh, they're just prisoners,

05:15.983 --> 05:18.986
so there's no need to filter
the air, is that it?

05:21.689 --> 05:24.558
Don't worry about me.
I'm holdin' on okay.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.760
What are you doing here?
Are the kids all right?

05:26.794 --> 05:30.063
Yeah, they're good,
but, oh, Jim...

05:33.166 --> 05:34.101
I've been contacted

05:34.134 --> 05:38.972
by the, the recruitment people
for Terra Nova.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.114
Terra Nova.

05:49.316 --> 05:53.086
That's incredible news.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.187
When?

05:54.221 --> 05:59.493
The Tenth Pilgrimage
is scheduled to leave next week.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.430
My God, Liz, you gotta go.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.665
You gotta take the kids
and you gotta go.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.734
Jim...
It's a chance at a new life.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.412
Don't mess it up.
No, no, you don't understand.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.003
They're not gonna let me
take Zoe.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.573
Why?

06:14.041 --> 06:17.878
They said we can't be
rewarded for breaking the law.

06:17.911 --> 06:23.016
So it's... it's me and Maddy
and Josh or it's nothing.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.055
No. There's, there's, there's
got to be some way around this.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.023
There is.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.797
Time's up. Someone's coming.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.665
Okay.

06:37.698 --> 06:42.069
Jim, I'm counting on you.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.270
We need to go now!

06:43.303 --> 06:44.838
Okay, all right.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.974
Just let me give him this, okay?

06:47.007 --> 06:50.010
Please? It's the air.
It's killing him.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.779
Fine.

06:54.214 --> 06:58.886
Take that, and take care
of yourself, okay? Okay?

07:43.764 --> 07:46.500
Terra Nova, a new world.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.802
A name everyone,
everywhere has come

07:48.836 --> 07:51.705
to know as a symbol of hope.

07:51.739 --> 07:55.943
22 years have passed since
scientists first realized

07:55.976 --> 08:00.047
their experiments uncovered
an unexpected phenomenon.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.115
Physicists characterized
this anomaly

08:02.149 --> 08:04.952
as a fracture in the fabric
of time and space...

08:04.985 --> 08:06.754
He said he'd be
on this train.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.821
He'll be here, Maddy.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.489
Just keep
your voice down.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.158
I got it all
planned out.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.459
Don't worry.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.694
Yeah, step one:

08:13.727 --> 08:15.963
Dad breaks out of a
maximum-security facility.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.166
Step two: Dad breaks into
a maximum-security facility.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.034
Piece of cake.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.605
Next in line, please.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.741
Dr. Elisabeth Shannon.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.209
Transferring
with two children?

08:29.242 --> 08:30.944
That's right.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.164
The latest word
from Hope Plaza is that

09:24.197 --> 09:26.566
the Tenth Pilgrimage will depart
for Terra Nova.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.068
In just an hour from now.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.704
This Pilgrimage will bring
the total number of colonists

09:30.738 --> 09:33.073
to Terra Nova to...

10:08.776 --> 10:10.678
Next in line, please.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.345
Thank you.

10:12.379 --> 10:16.016
...please report
to the departure platform.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.218
If you are wearing
a red security badge...

10:29.629 --> 10:31.331
I love you.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.134
I miss you already.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.338
I'm gonna figure out
a way to get you there...

10:38.371 --> 10:42.710
even if I have to come back
here and get you myself.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.878
It's a one-way trip, Josh.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.814
There's no way back.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.982
Final call has commenced.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.986
Please proceed immediately
to the departure platform.

10:53.020 --> 10:56.356
Go. Live a wonderful life.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.258
I love you.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.935
Please return
your rebreathers

11:07.968 --> 11:10.137
and place them in the bins
provided.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.440
Your rebreathers
will not be required.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.324
Launch platform is straight
down that corridor.

12:04.357 --> 12:05.492
Hurry.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.469
You're late.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.605
Where is it?

12:18.638 --> 12:20.440
The money first.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.475
Where is it?

12:33.120 --> 12:36.223
Remember, if you get caught,
you're on your own.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.032
Portal dilation
will commence in T-minus five...

12:45.065 --> 12:47.267
Come on, Jim,
where are you?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.569
If Dad doesn't make it,
do we still have to go?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.570
He'll make it.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.340
He has to.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.609
The event horizon is
at point-six microns.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.979
Point-seven.
Holding at point-seven.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.915
Standing by
to initiate portal dilation.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.884
Terminus is stable.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.219
Initiate portal dilation.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.797
Your bodies
will not be accustomed

13:17.831 --> 13:20.968
to the oxygen-rich atmosphere.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.204
Please take short, even breaths.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.407
Medical assistance and care
will be on hand.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.125
Receiving portal
is synchronized.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.451
Sir, you need to have
a look at this.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.889
Terminus is stable.

13:41.922 --> 13:44.557
Get me security.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.604
Disorientation is expected
while transiting.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.440
Your eyes will not be accustomed
to the bright sunlight.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.676
Medical care will be on hand
to provide assistance.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.313
I'm telling you, he's not gonna
show. Something went wrong.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.955
Mom.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.092
Oh, Jim, thank God.

14:19.126 --> 14:19.960
Dad.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.594
Okay, okay.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.298
Easy. Don't call attention.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.937
Perimeter breach.
Suspect...

14:29.970 --> 14:31.671
Jim, what?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.507
Take the pack.

14:42.916 --> 14:46.153
Whatever happens,
keep moving.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.387
Go.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.358
Go.

14:52.359 --> 14:55.228
Sir, I need you to
step out of line.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.900
You were seen leaving
a restricted area.

15:00.934 --> 15:04.137
Oh, sorry, I took
a wrong turn.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.005
Mom!

15:05.038 --> 15:06.073
We have to keep going.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.041
If we go in there,
we can't come back.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.243
We will be right behind you.

15:12.946 --> 15:15.648
Go.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.365
I've already been
through security.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.657
I need to check your pack
and do a retinal scan.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.336
I told you I've already
been cleared.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.329
No, I won't go without Dad.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.164
Go with your brother.
Mom!

15:31.198 --> 15:32.841
It's okay. I'm gonna be
right behind you, Maddy.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.501
But Dad...
Will find a way.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.369
Okay?

15:36.403 --> 15:38.238
He always does.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.406
Now go.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.908
You go.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.577
I love you.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.918
This is ridiculous.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.320
You must have made a mistake.

15:59.592 --> 16:02.295
Sir, I need to know why
you were in a restricted area.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.405
Sir, you're gonna
have to come with me now.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.842
Hey!

16:15.875 --> 16:17.044
Stop that man!

16:17.077 --> 16:19.579
Someone stop him!

16:29.722 --> 16:31.391
Back up, back up!

16:31.424 --> 16:33.626
Come on, you guys,
let's go.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.771
He's going into
hyperoxic shock!

16:44.804 --> 16:46.239
CO2 infuser now!

16:46.273 --> 16:46.906
Dad!

16:46.939 --> 16:49.042
Gun!

16:49.076 --> 16:51.344
Get away from my family!

16:52.879 --> 16:53.780
Put it down!

16:53.813 --> 16:55.115
Put it down!

16:57.450 --> 16:59.519
Check that pack
for more weapons!

17:01.954 --> 17:03.623
No! No!
No!

17:59.011 --> 18:00.046
You heard right.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.749
Two stowaways... adult male
and a five-year-old girl.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.552
Copy that,
Lieutenant Washington.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.156
Tell Commander Taylor
we're headed back now.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.233
So how much trouble
do you think we're in?

18:20.267 --> 18:21.601
Well, you were recruited.

18:21.634 --> 18:25.037
I mean, they need you too much
not to cut you some slack.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.440
Me?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.542
You think they'll make you
serve out your time?

18:29.576 --> 18:30.610
I hope not.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.180
I'm not scheduled
to be released

18:33.213 --> 18:36.849
for another 85
million years.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.188
Are those clouds?

18:43.055 --> 18:45.625
Yeah, sweetie,
they are.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.728
They're so white.

19:06.112 --> 19:08.281
Hey, uh, Zoe?

19:08.315 --> 19:11.184
I know I was gone
a long time, but

19:11.218 --> 19:13.886
you remember me, right?

19:25.465 --> 19:29.001
Allosaur tripped a sonic-mine.

19:29.035 --> 19:29.836
Just keep moving.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.071
Allosaur... that the
carnivorous kind?

19:32.104 --> 19:34.040
Yep.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.642
We're getting close.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.930
Hey, welcome to Terra Nova.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.673
Welcome!

20:32.198 --> 20:34.334
Citizens of 2149...

20:36.436 --> 20:39.772
I'm Commander Nathaniel Taylor.

20:39.806 --> 20:43.676
But you probably
already know that.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.845
Congratulations.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.847
Each one of you has taken
a first step,

20:47.880 --> 20:53.052
just as I did seven years ago,
toward a new beginning.

20:53.085 --> 20:58.891
Together, we are at the dawn
of a new civilization.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.694
No pressure.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.766
The world you left behind
fell victim

21:06.799 --> 21:10.370
to some of the baser instincts
of our species:

21:10.403 --> 21:14.874
Greed, war, ignorance.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.276
We blew it.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.612
We destroyed our home.

21:24.083 --> 21:28.888
But we have been entrusted
with a second chance.

21:28.921 --> 21:32.659
A chance to start over.

21:32.692 --> 21:36.396
A chance to get it right.

21:38.030 --> 21:41.100
Welcome to Terra Nova, folks.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.370
Welcome home.

21:58.050 --> 22:01.153
Taylor wants
to see you.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.623
Without the children.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.492
Okay.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.260
We'll be right back,
sweetheart.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.329
We'll be right back.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.511
Dr. Elisabeth Shannon.

22:24.544 --> 22:27.146
First in your class
at Northwestern Med.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.281
Doctor of science in immunology,

22:29.315 --> 22:33.620
bacteriology, and a couple other
ologies I can't even pronounce.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.622
Two years pro bono trauma work

22:35.655 --> 22:37.557
at I Help the Poor People
General.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.125
Commander Taylor...
What I don't get is

22:39.158 --> 22:42.395
it also says here that your
husband is currently serving

22:42.429 --> 22:44.330
a six-year bit
at Golad lock away.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.366
And yet,
here he is.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.037
With a third child in tow.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.540
What am I to make of this?

22:53.573 --> 22:56.776
Look, uh, this was
all my idea, okay?

22:56.809 --> 22:59.278
Elisabeth didn't even know.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.448
Didn't she?

23:03.082 --> 23:08.154
A man doesn't escape from Golad
without help from the outside.

23:09.656 --> 23:13.025
Um, they weren't going to let
us bring Zoe.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.126
There was no other choice.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.896
Law caps families at two kids.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.599
You had a third, you got
caught and you took the fall.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.133
The thing is this:

23:21.167 --> 23:25.204
I really don't care about
populations laws from another time.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.541
What I do care about is
whether or not an individual

23:28.575 --> 23:31.210
is of use to this colony.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.012
A doctor we need.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.114
An escaped fugitive...

23:35.147 --> 23:36.048
Not so much.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.560
Commander Taylor,
all we're looking for here

23:37.584 --> 23:41.988
is... a fresh start.

23:42.021 --> 23:45.892
We just want to be
a family again.

23:51.564 --> 23:55.167
Well, Dr. Shannon, we are
pleased to have you here.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.604
Lieutenant Washington

23:57.637 --> 23:59.872
will show you
your kits.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.609
I'm going to have a private
word with your husband.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.681
Now it also says here

24:08.715 --> 24:12.719
that you were a cop
before you went away.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.987
Narcotics, Chicago P.D.

24:15.021 --> 24:15.888
I don't understand.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.925
A man sworn to uphold the law,

24:18.958 --> 24:21.861
a woman as accomplished
as your wife...

24:21.894 --> 24:25.331
And you decide to have
a third kid.

24:25.364 --> 24:26.866
To risk everything. Why?

24:26.899 --> 24:29.736
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

24:29.769 --> 24:33.640
You thought that
was a good idea?

24:33.673 --> 24:35.675
That you'd actually
get away with it?

24:35.708 --> 24:37.476
Good grief, son,
what were you thinking?

24:37.510 --> 24:39.946
What's between me and my wife
is none of your damn business.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.948
Now, are you going
to lock me up or what?

24:41.981 --> 24:44.183
What I ought to do is throw you
outside the fence

24:44.216 --> 24:45.518
and let you fend for yourself.

24:45.552 --> 24:48.287
No, what you ought to do is give
me a gun and a badge and let me

24:48.320 --> 24:49.455
do what I'm good at.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.825
There must be some bad guys
around here who need catching.

24:57.363 --> 25:01.668
Agricultural detail
is down a man.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.270
That's all.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.273
According to my daughter,

25:07.306 --> 25:10.142
I have whatever the opposite
of a green thumb is.

25:12.579 --> 25:15.147
I'll do my best.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.761
Agricultural duty.

25:28.795 --> 25:31.664
You can make that
work, right?

25:31.698 --> 25:34.266
Beats making
license plates.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.434
Your quarters are here

25:35.467 --> 25:37.870
in the newer part
of the settlement.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.139
There's a PX down that way
for supplies.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.141
Some of these units
aren't quite finished.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.944
I don't even think yours
has been painted yet.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.413
Here we are.

25:47.446 --> 25:49.616
This is ours?

25:49.649 --> 25:52.719
If you need anything,
just let us know.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.623
This is it.
Come on.

26:05.497 --> 26:08.067
I get the room
with the most windows!

26:08.100 --> 26:09.301
I get first pick.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.904
Says who?
I'm the oldest.

26:11.938 --> 26:16.308
Man, they gave us
the M-7 model.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.477
It's not bad, right?

26:18.510 --> 26:20.379
We can throw
some paint on the walls.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.314
Get a rug or something.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.951
Do they have rugs here?

26:24.984 --> 26:27.219
Maybe a nice sort
of Dino runner

26:27.253 --> 26:30.823
would be great down
the hallway. I don't know.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.359
Jim.

26:35.161 --> 26:38.564
We did the right
thing, didn't we?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.599
Coming here?

26:42.802 --> 26:44.536
Mommy, there's
no room for me.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.875
We'll figure something
out, sweetie.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.046
She doesn't know me.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.383
Last time you saw her,
she was barely three.

27:00.953 --> 27:04.791
So, we need to find
a bed for...

27:04.824 --> 27:07.459
Oh, what's your
name again?

27:07.493 --> 27:09.662
Oh, that's
right, Martha.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.497
Okay, so we need...

27:12.665 --> 27:14.901
Oh, right, right, right.
Priscilla.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.105
Not Priscilla, huh?

27:22.641 --> 27:25.778
Oh, wait, I got it.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.113
It's Zoe. Yeah.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.782
Well, hi, Zoe.
My name's Alfredo.

27:29.816 --> 27:30.783
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.484
I... What?

27:32.518 --> 27:33.853
No, it's not.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.856
Well, what is it?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.895
Daddy.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.171
Okay, so it's settled.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.941
Me and Zoe get this room,
seeing as it's bigger.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.909
And we can squeeze
another bed in.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.277
Can I see?
Yeah.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.414
One big, happy family.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.284
Like nothing ever happened.
What's that supposed to mean?

28:09.421 --> 28:12.191
I guess we're supposed to just
forget about the last years

28:12.224 --> 28:14.761
we had to fend for ourselves
'cause Dad was in jail.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.262
Josh! That's enough.
Admit it, Mom,

28:16.295 --> 28:17.463
it's his own damn fault.

28:17.496 --> 28:20.132
If he hadn't lost his cool
and thrown a punch at that cop

28:20.166 --> 28:21.276
he might have just gotten
away with a fine.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.601
Have you ever thought
about that?

28:22.634 --> 28:24.503
Hey, we're not gonna
stand here and argue

28:24.536 --> 28:26.372
the past with you, okay?

28:26.405 --> 28:29.776
We're starting over.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.178
As a family.

28:36.282 --> 28:39.218
Zoe.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.020
- Has anybody seen Zoe?
- Where'd she go?

28:41.053 --> 28:42.554
I thought she
was with you.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.490
She was.
Zoe?

28:44.523 --> 28:46.926
Zoe?
Zoe?

29:33.205 --> 29:34.506
Zoe!

30:20.152 --> 30:22.989
Good night, sweetheart.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.557
I'm really glad
you're home, Dad.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.268
Good night.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.674
Night.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.911
Yep.

30:59.725 --> 31:02.661
She got used to sleeping
in my room.

31:02.694 --> 31:06.032
It seems we've
run out of beds.

31:06.798 --> 31:09.235
Luckily there's a couch.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.237
Right.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.820
The answer is yes.

31:28.854 --> 31:31.690
We did do the right thing,

31:31.723 --> 31:33.159
coming here.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.307
You telling me this
is all we can have

31:48.340 --> 31:50.585
for the next three days? Did
you not read any of the literature

31:50.609 --> 31:51.910
they gave us?

31:51.944 --> 31:54.056
Real food has all these enzymes
are bodies aren't used to yet.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.457
And besides it's
really not that bad.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.758
I don't want to go
to orientation.

31:56.782 --> 31:57.883
I want to stay with you.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.427
Mommy has a brand-new
job she has to go to.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.687
And Maddy and Josh are going
to go to orientation

32:01.720 --> 32:03.055
so you can go
with them, okay?

32:03.089 --> 32:04.566
You guys used up
all the hot water. Thanks.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.693
No, the solar panels can only
heat up so much at a time.

32:07.726 --> 32:10.129
Blame it on the sun,
if you want.

32:19.505 --> 32:22.574
The Agricultural department,
a quarter mile that way, Dad.

32:22.608 --> 32:23.675
And...
Wait, that way?

32:23.709 --> 32:25.577
The clinic should be
right here. Are you sure?

32:25.611 --> 32:28.180
All right, I better go.
That's... okay.

32:28.214 --> 32:29.348
Have a good time.

32:29.381 --> 32:33.885
Okay, now, you... no more
wandering off, okay? Okay.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.687
So see you when you're done.
Yeah.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.056
Have fun. Bye.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.358
Okay, so we should be
meeting at the south end.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.726
Come on.

32:40.759 --> 32:41.793
No way.

32:41.827 --> 32:44.830
I can't believe it!

32:44.863 --> 32:47.333
Can't believe what?

32:47.366 --> 32:48.967
What is it?

32:49.001 --> 32:50.736
You've got to be joking.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.071
It's the probe.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.448
You know, the one
they sent through

32:53.472 --> 32:55.607
when they first discovered
the time fracture.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.076
How can you not know that?

32:57.109 --> 32:58.510
I was having a life, Maddy.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.812
No one knew at first
how far back the fracture went

33:00.846 --> 33:01.947
or even where it led to.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.115
They sent this back

33:03.149 --> 33:05.417
with a beacon inside
so that, you know,

33:05.451 --> 33:06.628
they could find it however many

33:06.652 --> 33:08.587
millions of
years later.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.688
Only, they never did.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.158
That's how they knew that they

33:12.191 --> 33:13.792
were dealing
with a new time stream.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.261
Whatever, Maddy.
Whatever?

33:15.294 --> 33:17.429
Okay, Josh,
you do realize that if we

33:17.463 --> 33:19.998
were in the same time stream,
then something like...

33:20.032 --> 33:22.801
I don't know...
Just stepping on a butterfly

33:22.834 --> 33:24.002
could change
everything.

33:24.036 --> 33:26.405
Like, for example,
us never being born.

33:26.438 --> 33:30.709
Can I scratch my name on
it like everybody else's?

33:30.742 --> 33:33.045
Yeah, go ahead, Zoe.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.614
Mark it up.
Okay, I'm out of here.

33:35.647 --> 33:36.848
Where are you going?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.750
To get some real food.
I'm starving.

33:38.784 --> 33:39.551
What about orientation?

33:39.585 --> 33:40.986
I can explore
on my own, Maddy.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.621
Josh!
Look after Zoe.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.257
Let's keep it simple.

33:45.291 --> 33:48.527
Why don't you, uh, give us
a hand with, uh, some weeding?

33:48.560 --> 33:49.828
Weeding?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.630
Yeah. Think I
can handle that.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.432
Good.

33:53.465 --> 33:57.035
Yeah, this place needs
a whole lot of upkeep.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.205
I'll leave you to it.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.114
Okay.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.581
I'm okay.

34:42.614 --> 34:43.649
I'm okay.

34:43.681 --> 34:45.684
Just a bug.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.918
No worries. I'm okay.

34:47.953 --> 34:51.422
Just a... just a bug.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.634
Yes!

35:10.642 --> 35:12.611
Thanks.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.952
Oh, this is
funny to you?

35:20.986 --> 35:22.354
That's how
you get off...

35:22.388 --> 35:25.724
Making fun of the new
guy trying to eat fruit?

35:27.726 --> 35:30.396
Here. Give it to me.

35:36.568 --> 35:37.636
Go ahead.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.413
You get used to it.
I promise.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.848
I'll take your
word for it.

35:49.881 --> 35:52.451
Hey, what's your name?

35:52.484 --> 35:54.553
Josh.

35:54.586 --> 35:55.987
I'm Skye.

35:56.021 --> 35:57.989
Fifth Pilgrimage.

35:58.023 --> 36:00.192
So you a recruit or lottery?

36:00.226 --> 36:02.994
Uh, my mom was recruited,
so we all had to come.

36:03.028 --> 36:05.231
Most people
count themselves lucky.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.437
You left somebody behind, huh?

36:13.372 --> 36:15.507
So what's there to do
around here anyway?

36:17.643 --> 36:21.547
Well, depends on how close
to the edge you like to walk.

36:32.624 --> 36:35.561
Okay, bed one's sedated
and his wound's sutured.

36:35.594 --> 36:38.464
Great. Nurse, a hand
over here, please.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.832
If you get a sec, could you
check bed three's oxygen?

36:40.866 --> 36:42.167
Okay.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.703
Hi. I'm Dr. Shannon.

36:45.837 --> 36:46.738
Okay, so you came in

36:46.772 --> 36:50.108
complaining of nausea
and a headache, right?

36:50.141 --> 36:52.811
The other doctor said
I was hyperoxic,

36:52.844 --> 36:54.413
whatever that means.

36:54.446 --> 36:57.115
It means you're not used
to so much fresh air.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.352
Can you
unhook me, please?

37:00.386 --> 37:01.663
They said it'd only
take a half hour,

37:01.687 --> 37:03.455
and it's been at least
that long already.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.591
I don't see an IV anywhere.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.528
Is that...
is that a technical term?

37:10.996 --> 37:12.698
Sorry.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.433
Interesting.

37:14.466 --> 37:17.469
They must get rid of the
excess oxygen from the blood.

37:17.503 --> 37:19.070
Can you just
get it off me?

37:19.104 --> 37:21.006
Yeah. Let me just...

37:25.844 --> 37:26.945
Hang on.

37:32.284 --> 37:34.686
There we go.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.788
All better.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.292
Josh.
Dad.

37:40.326 --> 37:41.927
You're supposed to
be at orientation.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.329
What are you doing?

37:45.531 --> 37:47.466
Josh, this is not how you
start your first day.

37:47.499 --> 37:48.739
Would you excuse
my son, please?

37:48.767 --> 37:50.836
There's somewhere
he needs to be.

37:50.869 --> 37:51.937
Let's go.
Come on.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.305
Hey, I told you...

37:53.339 --> 37:54.416
You can't just come back
after all this time

37:54.440 --> 37:56.775
and start telling me
what to do.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.617
Let's go.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.062
So how bad
are things in 2149?

38:17.095 --> 38:19.365
It's funny... when it's
the only thing you know,

38:19.398 --> 38:21.066
it all seems so normal,
but coming here

38:21.099 --> 38:23.301
makes you realize
how bad things have gotten.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.570
I don't really
remember much.

38:24.603 --> 38:26.405
I was just a kid
when we left.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.374
Oh, this is my place here.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.710
Hey, guys. This is Josh.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.645
He's new. Welcome to Terra Nova.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.047
I'm Tasha. That's Hunter.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.049
How you doing, fresh?

38:39.117 --> 38:40.452
So far, so good.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.488
So this is all
your guys' place?

38:42.521 --> 38:44.523
Yeah, us
and one other... Max.

38:44.556 --> 38:45.757
And your parents?

38:45.791 --> 38:47.793
Mine live just up that way. Why?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.728
It's your own place.
Aren't you only, like, 16?

38:49.761 --> 38:51.697
So? I mean, we work.
We have jobs.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.131
Yeah, this
is the frontier, son.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.199
You got to grow up quick.

38:54.232 --> 38:56.635
You got the whole Taylor
welcome speech, didn't you?

38:56.668 --> 38:58.970
We're the new dawn
of civilization.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.573
How was
the office, sweetheart?

39:01.607 --> 39:04.209
Not bad. We finished
another hydroturbine today.

39:04.242 --> 39:05.310
Who's the fresh?

39:05.343 --> 39:06.445
Name is Josh.

39:06.478 --> 39:08.380
Max. Glad to meet you.

39:08.414 --> 39:10.516
It's so hot.
Who's up for a little OTG?

39:10.549 --> 39:12.784
- Yes!
- On foot? No way.

39:12.818 --> 39:15.153
Well, guess who started
repair dock duty this week.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.087
Great. Okay.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.356
We'll meet you guys
in the usual spot in 20?

39:18.390 --> 39:19.725
Yeah.

39:19.758 --> 39:22.694
OTG on your first day.
That's got to be a record.

39:37.308 --> 39:40.412
To us.

39:40.446 --> 39:41.813
We actually made it.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.182
I had my doubts
for a minute there.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.393
So...

39:55.427 --> 39:57.963
how is your day going?

39:57.996 --> 40:03.168
Well, I practiced some
neo-medieval medicine,

40:03.201 --> 40:06.037
and I tended to a thief.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.906
A thief?

40:08.774 --> 40:11.109
That's what they
told me. Why?

40:11.142 --> 40:12.844
Well, it's just,

40:12.878 --> 40:14.846
why would anyone
steal anything here?

40:14.880 --> 40:17.082
Everyone's pretty much
provided for.

40:17.115 --> 40:17.749
Who knows?

40:17.783 --> 40:19.685
But guess what.
What?

40:19.718 --> 40:21.653
It's not your problem.

40:22.821 --> 40:25.056
You're not a cop anymore.

40:26.157 --> 40:30.361
So what's this about Josh
skipping orientation?

40:31.763 --> 40:34.500
I don't know.
He just blew it off.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.434
I mean, I...
I can't say I'm surprised.

40:36.468 --> 40:38.003
Oh, no, I can't
say I am, either.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.171
You know what? We shouldn't
be too hard on him.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.272
He's been through a lot.

40:41.306 --> 40:42.674
We all have.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.810
That doesn't excuse him
getting out of line with me.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.813
He really missed you...
You know that.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.683
Just give him
some time, okay?

40:51.717 --> 40:53.852
He'll come around.

40:53.885 --> 40:57.055
I just worry about him.
That's all.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.828
He has this knack
for finding trouble.

41:03.662 --> 41:05.230
Where are we going?
Stay close.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.236
Okay.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.973
You... you don't have to
come if you don't want to.

41:15.006 --> 41:17.108
Out there?
You're kidding, right?

41:17.943 --> 41:20.846
Only way to find out
is to come with.

41:22.748 --> 41:25.116
There. No big deal.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.822
You coming or not?

41:44.536 --> 41:45.804
Skye. Damn.

41:45.837 --> 41:47.606
Come on. We were about
to leave without you.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.941
Ah, hell you were, Hunter.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.010
Get ready to go OTG, fresh.

41:53.044 --> 41:54.713
OTG?

41:54.746 --> 41:56.848
Outside the gates.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.826
Who's up for the shortcut?

42:07.859 --> 42:11.262
No way, Skye.
We'll meet you there.

42:11.296 --> 42:13.064
Keep up.

42:13.098 --> 42:14.733
I'm trying.

42:17.736 --> 42:18.937
Just a howler.

42:18.970 --> 42:22.040
Sound a lot worse
than they actually are.

42:26.111 --> 42:29.014
What, are you just
going to stand there and watch?

42:56.441 --> 42:57.575
You think that was fun?

42:57.609 --> 42:58.753
You want to see
something really cool?

42:58.777 --> 43:00.378
Cooler than that? Sure?
All right.

43:00.411 --> 43:03.048
Come on.

43:04.449 --> 43:06.351
This way.

43:08.754 --> 43:11.056
Check it out.

43:11.857 --> 43:14.125
Found it when we
were exploring.

43:19.798 --> 43:22.067
There's more
over there.

43:36.481 --> 43:37.916
What is it?

43:37.949 --> 43:40.952
Looks like some kind
of geometry or something.

43:40.986 --> 43:43.922
I think they're equations,
but I can't be sure.

43:43.955 --> 43:47.358
I-I can't make heads
or tails of it.

43:47.392 --> 43:48.727
Who did this?

43:48.760 --> 43:49.928
I don't know.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.629
Why do it on
a bunch of rocks?

43:51.663 --> 43:54.966
Doesn't make any sense. It looks
like it's been here for awhile.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.602
You tell Taylor about
this place? No. We're not

43:57.635 --> 43:58.904
even supposed
to be out here.

43:58.937 --> 44:00.271
This whole area's off-limits.

44:00.305 --> 44:04.175
It's like Taylor doesn't want
anyone to know about this.

44:06.077 --> 44:10.181
Don't tell anybody about this,

44:10.215 --> 44:11.416
all right?

44:11.449 --> 44:13.852
You promise?

44:14.720 --> 44:17.088
Good.

44:42.247 --> 44:44.850
What was he stealing that made
it necessary to shoot him?

44:44.883 --> 44:47.753
Him and his buddies were
siphoning off our power grid.

44:47.786 --> 44:50.088
Why would they need to do that?
They're Sixes.

44:50.121 --> 44:52.223
Sixes?

44:55.293 --> 44:56.795
Slide your weapon
across the floor.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.529
Now!

45:08.907 --> 45:12.043
So, basically,
Calysonias is real finicky,

45:12.077 --> 45:15.113
so you gotta keep
the nitrogen level just so,

45:15.146 --> 45:18.283
otherwise the roots get
hydroxic.

45:18.316 --> 45:19.384
Hydroxic?

45:19.417 --> 45:20.385
Right.
Right.

45:20.418 --> 45:22.754
So what you need to do is
you need to stick this

45:22.788 --> 45:24.189
into the root
of the plant,

45:24.222 --> 45:26.391
and then you need
to record it on here.

45:26.424 --> 45:27.525
Okay.

45:27.558 --> 45:28.827
Are you listening?

45:31.729 --> 45:33.331
And like I was saying,

45:33.364 --> 45:35.633
once you, uh, get it on there,
into the plant,

45:35.666 --> 45:36.935
and then you record
it here.

45:36.968 --> 45:39.604
Yeah, you know, I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be right back,

45:39.637 --> 45:41.472
and we're gonna do more stuff

45:41.506 --> 45:42.573
with the,
with the thing...

45:42.607 --> 45:43.674
Right.
Hydroxic.

45:43.708 --> 45:45.243
Hydroxic.

45:58.023 --> 46:00.058
...and Hope Plaza says they want
to put through

46:00.091 --> 46:01.793
more than a hundred people
next time.

46:01.827 --> 46:04.863
That's a lot of housing units,
not a lot of time.

46:17.675 --> 46:19.644
...suspend work on
the south beach,

46:19.677 --> 46:21.379
we'll focus
on the western project.

46:25.316 --> 46:26.551
Get down, Taylor!

46:26.584 --> 46:27.986
Down!

46:35.526 --> 46:37.695
Throw him in the brig.

46:37.728 --> 46:39.998
I'll deal
with him later.

46:43.734 --> 46:45.670
You want to tell me
who that was

46:45.703 --> 46:47.272
and what the hell's
going on here?

46:52.643 --> 46:57.015
Come on, let's take a drive.

46:57.048 --> 47:00.018
There's a lot about this place
you need to know.

47:05.924 --> 47:07.392
School was nice,
didn't you think?

47:07.425 --> 47:09.803
You know, playground where you
don't have to wear a rebreather.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.563
I want to see the
dinosaurs again. Zoe?

47:12.597 --> 47:14.732
You do, huh?

47:14.765 --> 47:15.877
It's probably
not a good idea, though,

47:15.901 --> 47:19.004
'cause if they get too full,
then they get really sleepy

47:19.037 --> 47:21.506
and it's really noisy
when dinosaurs snore.

47:21.539 --> 47:23.975
Well, actually, brachisauri
aren't actually true herbivores.

47:24.009 --> 47:25.911
They, they sometimes supplement
their diets

47:25.944 --> 47:27.145
with smaller reptiles,

47:27.178 --> 47:28.923
which is why they have
proto-lateral incisors.

47:28.947 --> 47:31.316
Two sets: Upper and lower.

47:34.419 --> 47:35.853
Okay.

47:35.887 --> 47:38.423
All right, I'll see
you guys later.

47:38.456 --> 47:39.457
Yeah.

47:40.625 --> 47:42.527
Kill me now.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.863
You can't build civilization
in a day, Shannon.

47:45.897 --> 47:47.698
Bound to be
a few setbacks.

47:47.732 --> 47:49.634
We've had our share.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.002
Yeah? Like what?

47:51.036 --> 47:53.704
That fella who tried
to put a bullet in me?

47:53.738 --> 47:57.909
He's part of another settlement
that split away from Terra Nova.

47:57.943 --> 48:00.645
Around here,
people call 'em "Sixers."

48:00.678 --> 48:03.114
They call them that
'cause they all came through

48:03.148 --> 48:05.350
on the Sixth Pilgrimage.

48:07.718 --> 48:10.655
At first, they seemed
just like the rest of us.

48:10.688 --> 48:14.892
But pretty soon, we began
noticing some things,

48:14.926 --> 48:16.661
like how curious
they were

48:16.694 --> 48:18.263
about camp security
procedures.

48:18.296 --> 48:22.300
By the time we found the cache
of contraband weapons,

48:22.333 --> 48:25.003
it was clear...
They had an agenda.

48:25.036 --> 48:27.805
What agenda? Who sent them?

48:27.838 --> 48:31.709
Believe me, many nights, I've
asked myself the same thing.

48:31.742 --> 48:36.514
Long story short... they caught
on that we caught on to them,

48:36.547 --> 48:38.950
then they high-tailed it
like thieves in the night.

48:38.984 --> 48:41.686
Pilfered a significant
amount of equipment...

48:41.719 --> 48:42.920
And weapons.

48:42.954 --> 48:47.092
Well, maybe they gamed
the lottery somehow.

48:47.125 --> 48:49.694
The thought has occurred to me.

48:49.727 --> 48:53.198
What did Hope Plaza have to say
about all this?

48:53.231 --> 48:55.366
What makes you think
I asked them?

48:55.400 --> 48:58.703
Until we know who sent those
people back, and why,

48:58.736 --> 49:02.540
I just don't know who in
the future I can trust.

49:25.563 --> 49:28.233
This is what
we're fighting for, Jim,

49:28.266 --> 49:31.669
a new beginning for all of us.

49:35.606 --> 49:38.143
If today has shown me anything,
it's shown me

49:38.176 --> 49:39.577
that you've got
what it takes

49:39.610 --> 49:42.147
to be part of my security
team here in Terra Nova.

49:42.180 --> 49:46.117
You asked me
for a badge and a gun.

49:46.151 --> 49:48.419
They're yours if you want 'em.

49:50.955 --> 49:52.490
Welcome aboard, Shannon.

49:58.863 --> 49:59.830
What is it?

49:59.864 --> 50:02.333
Where?

50:03.801 --> 50:05.370
Taylor to base.

50:05.403 --> 50:07.905
Got a pair of transports
in-bound.

50:07.938 --> 50:10.841
And they're
coming in hot.

50:10.875 --> 50:12.177
Who are they?
Sixers.

50:12.210 --> 50:15.746
Things are about to get ugly.

50:27.725 --> 50:30.528
Taylor to base. You got a visual
on those Sixers?

50:30.561 --> 50:32.681
We seen 'em, but we got a
work crew outside the gates.

50:33.198 --> 50:36.101
We need time to get them inside.

50:36.134 --> 50:37.735
I'll try and slow 'em down,

50:37.768 --> 50:40.605
but get everybody inside
as soon as you can.

50:40.638 --> 50:43.141
Over there! Two o'clock!

50:50.715 --> 50:52.550
Whoa! Look out!

50:56.387 --> 50:58.823
What are they firing at?
'Cause it's not us.

51:02.693 --> 51:03.694
What the hell is that?

51:03.728 --> 51:06.264
Carnotaurus.

51:06.297 --> 51:07.498
I hate Carnotaurus.

51:12.670 --> 51:14.572
We're all clear!

51:21.812 --> 51:23.748
What's going on
back there?

51:23.781 --> 51:25.850
Just keep driving!

51:28.886 --> 51:30.155
Situation's changed.

51:30.188 --> 51:32.557
We've got Carnos out here.
Get everyone inside.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.892
We'll deal with the Sixers
later.

51:34.925 --> 51:38.296
We're almost there,
but you gotta buy us more time.

51:42.567 --> 51:46.103
Hey! Keep those people back!
We got Sixers coming in!

51:49.807 --> 51:51.609
Take the wheel.
What?!

51:51.642 --> 51:52.777
Take the wheel!

51:52.810 --> 51:54.312
Okay. Okay.

51:57.182 --> 51:59.083
Hey! Hey!

51:59.116 --> 52:01.619
Look at me, you ugly bastard!

52:01.652 --> 52:02.653
This way!

52:03.821 --> 52:04.655
Mom!

52:04.689 --> 52:06.591
What's happening?

52:07.692 --> 52:09.494
Come here! Stay down!

52:19.003 --> 52:21.606
Come on. Come on.

52:31.982 --> 52:33.618
What are you waiting for?

52:37.822 --> 52:39.357
Sonics, go!

53:03.414 --> 53:04.715
Back away! Get back!

53:18.329 --> 53:20.197
Hello, Taylor.

53:20.231 --> 53:21.932
What are you
doing here, Mira?

53:23.067 --> 53:26.271
This is no way to treat company.

53:27.104 --> 53:28.873
Have your men lower
their weapons.

53:28.906 --> 53:30.174
You first.

53:30.207 --> 53:32.076
You're outnumbered.

53:32.109 --> 53:34.879
Then what are you so afraid of?

53:34.912 --> 53:37.615
Came here for a reason.

53:37.648 --> 53:39.016
You've got one of my people.

53:39.049 --> 53:41.085
Carter got shot...

53:41.118 --> 53:42.853
while he was trying
to siphon power

53:42.887 --> 53:43.654
off our grid.

53:43.688 --> 53:45.756
We know he's alive
and in your brig.

53:45.790 --> 53:47.558
You know this how?

53:47.592 --> 53:51.429
Maybe we still have a few
friends here in Terra Nova.

53:51.462 --> 53:54.565
Well, maybe I'll have a sit-down
with Carter...

53:54.599 --> 53:57.602
...have a little chat
about your friends.

53:57.635 --> 53:59.846
We want Carter, you son of a
bitch! Put the weapon down now!

53:59.870 --> 54:03.841
Don't even think about it!
Back up... right there!

54:03.874 --> 54:04.575
Watch it, you!

54:04.609 --> 54:08.746
Get back!
Don't come any closer!

54:08.779 --> 54:09.747
Enough!

54:09.780 --> 54:12.483
Stand down!

54:34.605 --> 54:36.541
A trade.

54:40.911 --> 54:42.246
What is that?

54:42.279 --> 54:44.281
Meteoric iron.

54:44.315 --> 54:46.183
They control the quarry.

54:46.216 --> 54:49.086
I want Carter,
medical supplies

54:49.119 --> 54:50.655
and ammo.

54:52.390 --> 54:56.260
You can have your man.

54:56.293 --> 54:58.062
You can have the meds.

54:58.095 --> 54:59.797
No ammo.

54:59.830 --> 55:01.165
No way.

55:01.198 --> 55:04.469
Can't blame a girl for trying.

55:04.502 --> 55:08.473
Guzman, get Carter
out of the brig.

55:08.506 --> 55:11.742
Have Medical put together
some supplies.

55:19.116 --> 55:20.685
You're new.

55:22.387 --> 55:25.490
Welcome to Paradise.

55:33.731 --> 55:34.365
Dad!

55:34.399 --> 55:36.166
Are you guys okay?

55:36.200 --> 55:37.668
Yeah.

55:37.702 --> 55:41.238
How'd you get yourself caught
up in the middle of all that?

55:41.271 --> 55:45.543
Taylor asked me
to join Security.

55:46.744 --> 55:49.313
So you're going to
be a cop again?

55:49.346 --> 55:51.416
Dr. Shannon.

55:51.449 --> 55:54.685
Uh, we could use a hand
over in the infirmary.

55:55.352 --> 55:56.654
It's all right. Go.

55:56.687 --> 55:59.457
I'll take the girls
back to the house.

56:02.259 --> 56:04.194
Come on. It's okay.

56:04.228 --> 56:07.331
That wasn't a very
nice dinosaur.

56:07.364 --> 56:08.966
No, he wasn't, was he?

56:08.999 --> 56:10.100
Is he gonna come back?

56:10.134 --> 56:13.170
Look, you don't have
to worry about him, okay?

56:13.203 --> 56:14.304
You're safe here.

56:14.338 --> 56:17.274
I want to go home.

56:17.307 --> 56:19.477
Oh, you want to go home, huh?

56:19.510 --> 56:22.246
Uh-huh, I know what you mean.

56:22.279 --> 56:24.181
It's all this sunshine,
isn't it?

56:24.214 --> 56:25.349
It's way too bright.

56:25.382 --> 56:26.684
And the, and the fresh air?

56:26.717 --> 56:28.819
Ooh! Boy, does that
ever get on my nerves.

56:28.853 --> 56:30.721
What's with all
these flowers here?

56:30.755 --> 56:32.389
I mean, there's,
there's too much color.

56:32.423 --> 56:33.791
And they're smelling
up the place!

56:33.824 --> 56:35.860
Daddy!

56:36.894 --> 56:38.228
Come on.

56:38.262 --> 56:40.197
You are home, sweetie.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.567
We all are.

56:43.300 --> 56:44.535
I'm telling you, Skye.

56:44.569 --> 56:45.870
We're close, Max, trust me.

56:45.903 --> 56:47.905
I thought you said you came out
here all the time.

56:47.938 --> 56:50.541
Yeah, well, it's been
over a week.

56:50.575 --> 56:52.510
- And the jungle grows fast.
- Oh, yeah.

56:52.543 --> 56:55.746
Here. Here we go.

57:01.151 --> 57:02.453
How'd we do?

57:02.487 --> 57:04.327
Could've used a couple more
days, maybe, but...

57:04.354 --> 57:06.023
it's not bad.

57:10.928 --> 57:12.963
Hey.

57:12.997 --> 57:14.499
Have a taste.

57:23.307 --> 57:24.975
Yeah, that is moonshine.

57:26.276 --> 57:28.245
Cretaceous-style.

57:28.278 --> 57:30.014
What's it made from?

57:30.047 --> 57:32.082
Uh... we call 'em fruts.

57:32.116 --> 57:33.317
You know, as in

57:33.350 --> 57:35.385
part-fruit, part-nut.

57:35.419 --> 57:38.623
Looks like we need a...
a restock.

57:38.656 --> 57:40.400
Well, why don't you guys go
grab us some fresh ones?

57:40.424 --> 57:43.193
Then Josh and I'll start
cutting. Let's do that.

57:53.403 --> 57:54.672
Why give Mira the meds?

57:54.705 --> 57:57.207
All we're doing is making it
more difficult to beat them.

57:57.241 --> 57:58.175
Look, Guz,

57:58.208 --> 57:59.143
we need the ore.

57:59.176 --> 58:00.110
You know that.

58:00.144 --> 58:01.812
Doc!

58:03.180 --> 58:04.515
That's enough iso-biotics.

58:04.549 --> 58:06.951
I don't want us
to run short.

58:13.924 --> 58:17.862
Look, I'm sorry you got tangled
up in that situation before.

58:17.895 --> 58:20.965
Security should've been more
careful with the prisoner.

58:20.998 --> 58:23.367
Wouldn't be the first time a
patient's pulled a knife on me.

58:23.400 --> 58:28.673
Considering you put in time at
a state hospital, I expect so.

58:31.809 --> 58:35.145
Dr. Shannon,
I'm curious.

58:35.179 --> 58:39.183
With your résumé,
as accomplished as you are...

58:39.216 --> 58:41.051
you could've had it
pretty good back there.

58:41.085 --> 58:44.521
I mean, money and connections,
you can buy a pretty good life.

58:44.555 --> 58:47.357
Maybe even one
of those houses

58:47.391 --> 58:49.259
in one of the Domes.

58:49.293 --> 58:50.828
Still, you chose to come here.

58:50.861 --> 58:52.496
Why?
Well, yeah, believe me,

58:52.529 --> 58:55.399
I've had plenty of colleagues
who have gone down that route,

58:55.432 --> 58:57.101
eking what they can

58:57.134 --> 58:59.069
from a world that's
on its last breath.

58:59.103 --> 59:02.773
But I didn't want that
for my children.

59:02.807 --> 59:04.842
I mean, I know life here
is gonna present

59:04.875 --> 59:07.211
a lot of challenges
to say the least, but...

59:08.913 --> 59:10.080
I think
they deserve

59:10.114 --> 59:14.685
the chance to be part
of something real...

59:14.719 --> 59:17.521
something new...

59:17.554 --> 59:19.624
something that has a future.

59:20.357 --> 59:22.026
I understand.

59:22.059 --> 59:25.362
I felt the same way
about getting my own boy here.

59:25.395 --> 59:27.632
I didn't know you had a son.

59:29.133 --> 59:32.102
Came in
on the Second Pilgrimage.

59:32.136 --> 59:35.439
Worked right here
in the Science division.

59:35.472 --> 59:37.341
He went missing
a few years back.

59:37.374 --> 59:39.576
I'm so sorry.

59:39.610 --> 59:41.211
Ah, there's
always the hope.

59:41.245 --> 59:44.148
I haven't given up on him.

59:44.181 --> 59:46.316
Dr. Shannon,

59:46.350 --> 59:48.152
it's good
to have you here.

59:48.185 --> 59:51.021
I think you're gonna do
just fine.

59:51.055 --> 59:53.557
Can I just ask you to please...

59:53.590 --> 59:56.260
to be careful
with my husband?

59:56.293 --> 01:00:00.230
You asking him to be
on your Security team,

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:02.032
that is between you and him.

01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:06.470
But, you know, I'm the one
who stays up late worrying.

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:10.675
I'll make sure
he gets home to you.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.784
What is this?

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:22.753
Oh, it's the, uh, the barb
from a slasher tail.

01:00:22.787 --> 01:00:25.322
The males all have 'em.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:26.857
It's sharp.

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:29.960
Yeah. You should
see their teeth.

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:33.463
Don't worry.
They mostly hunt at night.

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:35.399
Yeah.

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:37.367
Mostly?

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:42.973
Oh, no, thanks.

01:00:52.016 --> 01:00:56.721
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about
what happened back there.

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:58.588
That whole thing
with my dad.

01:01:03.527 --> 01:01:05.863
You two don't get along?

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:10.768
Ah, we're just... really
different, that's all.

01:01:13.938 --> 01:01:18.108
I mean, he can go from zero to
infinity in no second flat.

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:20.711
You saw how bent
out of shape he got.

01:01:20.745 --> 01:01:22.522
"That's not how you start
your first day, Josh."

01:01:22.546 --> 01:01:25.315
"Oh, excuse me, miss,
my son has somewhere to be."

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:30.988
He's lecturing me about rules?

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:33.023
He broke every rule in the book
just to get here.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:35.993
Right. No, he's like the kind of
guy who would show up

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:38.963
in a new place, and he's like,
"Oh, I'm gonna ditch orientation

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:42.099
and go for a swim with a bunch
of people I barely know."

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:43.233
Right?

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:49.239
Yeah, you guys
are pretty different.

01:01:53.277 --> 01:01:55.479
Pretty different.

01:01:56.146 --> 01:01:58.248
Yeah.

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:14.498
You're bleeding again.

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:16.266
Let me see.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.804
Look, I know things haven't
gone exactly like we planned.

01:02:21.371 --> 01:02:22.807
It's all about to change.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:26.844
Delta One, can you read me?

01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:29.313
Delta One, can you read me?

01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:30.280
Go ahead, Delta Two.

01:02:30.314 --> 01:02:31.524
We spotted a vacated
TN transport.

01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:33.283
Looks ripe.

01:02:33.317 --> 01:02:36.120
Grab the power supplies
and any ammo you find.

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:38.923
But move fast
they can't be too far.

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:03.313
This power cell is jammed.

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:05.349
Hurry it up already.

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:06.383
What's with you?

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:07.651
Thought I heard something.

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:09.186
You're always hearing things.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.455
Got it.

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:14.591
Let's get out of here.

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:22.632
What was that?

01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:23.567
Probably just a howler.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.568
Yeah.

01:03:24.601 --> 01:03:26.470
A... howler.

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:28.973
You know, it's getting late.
We should go.

01:03:44.721 --> 01:03:45.789
You wanted to see me?

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.458
Shannon, come on in.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:49.994
We've got a situation here.

01:03:50.027 --> 01:03:52.796
One of our rovers
went missing.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.198
Surveillance
picked this up.

01:03:54.231 --> 01:03:57.567
Couple of our kids sneaking
outside the perimeter.

01:03:57.601 --> 01:03:59.203
Josh!

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:01.747
We've been trying to reach
the rover over the comm

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:04.608
for the past half
hour... no response.

01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:06.076
Night is falling.

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:09.313
If we don't get to them pretty
quick, something else might.

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:13.683
Why in heaven's name would he
do something like that?!

01:04:13.717 --> 01:04:15.285
She must've talked him into it,

01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:16.662
so I'm going to go
with the search party.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.522
She? Who's she?

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.590
That girl he met
when he skipped orientation.

01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:23.093
I told him to go back,
but he wouldn't listen.

01:04:23.127 --> 01:04:24.394
Okay, I'm going with you.

01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:25.671
Uh, no, you're not
it's too dangerous.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:29.299
Jim, our son is out there!
Yeah. Let me handle it!

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:32.536
No, You "handling it" is why
he's out there in the first place.

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:33.569
Elisabeth!

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:38.675
Stay here.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.410
Watch your sister.

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:41.711
Dad!
It's okay.

01:04:41.745 --> 01:04:43.380
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:44.448
I promise.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.791
No, no, no, no.

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:55.659
Damn it!
Wh-Wh-What's wrong?

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:57.237
It's stripped.
The power cells are gone.

01:04:57.261 --> 01:04:58.128
The transport's
dead.

01:04:58.162 --> 01:05:01.065
Okay, well, then we
have to call somebody.

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:02.575
We have to tell them
that we're out here.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:03.567
Did you hear what he said?

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.269
It's dead. That means
there is no radio.

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:07.037
It's too far to walk.

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:09.974
We'll never make it
back before dark.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.610
Oh, God. What's that?

01:05:15.312 --> 01:05:17.414
That's a
Sixer vehicle.

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:19.183
What's a Sixer?

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:20.150
Wait, where are you going?

01:05:20.184 --> 01:05:21.385
To get our stuff back.

01:05:21.418 --> 01:05:22.286
Skye, no!

01:05:22.319 --> 01:05:23.620
I'm not going
over there.

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.322
You can't trust
a Sixer.

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:28.925
Whatever, Tash.
I'll handle them.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:29.960
Hello?

01:05:29.994 --> 01:05:32.997
We're not armed.

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.099
We just want to talk.

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:37.434
Hey, we're stuck out here
without those power cells.

01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:39.503
Skye.

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:40.637
Look, blood.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.539
Yo, guys, I got them.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:43.607
The cells are all here.

01:05:47.077 --> 01:05:48.578
Slasher, run! Go,
go, go, go, go, go!

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:50.014
Go, go, go!
What is it?!

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:51.148
Slasher! Just run!

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:52.549
Get away from me!

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:55.485
Come on, man,

01:05:55.519 --> 01:05:56.720
let us in, please.

01:05:56.753 --> 01:05:58.122
Hey, uh, I remember you.

01:05:58.155 --> 01:05:59.456
Drake, right?

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:00.957
It's me, Skye.

01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:02.492
Skye.

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:04.094
All right.
Get in.

01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:05.895
Come on, go. Get in,
get in. Let's go.

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:08.432
Get in! Come on, go! Hurry!

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:12.169
Max, get this
thing started!

01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:13.246
Yeah, well, it's got
an alpha-num key-punch.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:14.447
So unless I know
the code, then...

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.340
Okay, pop the panel,
jack the starter.

01:06:16.373 --> 01:06:17.450
I can't.
The rig is booby-trapped.

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:18.375
Hey, Drake.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:20.477
Hey, how do you
get this thing started?

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:21.378
It's dead.

01:06:21.411 --> 01:06:23.480
Power converter got crushed by

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:24.513
a slasher tail.

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:27.051
Oh, my God!

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:31.255
He's really
bleeding a lot.

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:33.457
Hey, your mom's
a doctor, right?

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.258
Found weapons!

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:35.825
Tie this
around his leg

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:37.161
above the wound
tight as you can.

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:40.497
You make it through this,
you won't be a fresh anymore.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.600
Oh, my God!

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:15.932
Last known location

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:18.402
is the outer marker, two klicks
down the southeast road.

01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:19.579
We're gonna head in
that direction,

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:21.238
start scanning
for a heat signature.

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:22.706
Hunter Boyce is missing.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:24.108
Max Pope, too.

01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:26.076
And another one.
Who?

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.311
My daughter.

01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:30.080
Tasha.

01:07:30.114 --> 01:07:31.781
Weapons and ammo
in the vehicle.

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:33.016
You'll need a medic.
No.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:35.919
Both parents,
dangerous situation, bad idea.

01:07:35.952 --> 01:07:37.521
Sorry, Jim.
No, I'm going.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:39.289
No time for squabbles.

01:07:39.323 --> 01:07:41.158
Both of you ride with me!

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:43.393
Move out, people!

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:05.081
Most people know I was the first
man through the portal.

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:07.484
What people don't
know is that

01:08:07.517 --> 01:08:09.319
the men who came through
behind me,

01:08:09.353 --> 01:08:11.588
well, they didn't show up
on this end right away.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:14.291
For them, it was just
the blink of an eye.

01:08:14.324 --> 01:08:17.093
For me, 118 days.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:22.098
Look, I know
you're scared for your boy.

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:23.099
You have every
reason to be.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:24.468
But point is,

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:27.871
this jungle can be survived.

01:08:38.682 --> 01:08:41.285
Why does it keep making
that sound?!

01:08:41.318 --> 01:08:44.188
Oh, God,
there's another one!

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:46.622
Slashers hunt in packs.

01:08:46.656 --> 01:08:48.134
They corner their prey
and signal the others.

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:50.160
Before long, there'll be dozens.

01:08:50.194 --> 01:08:51.928
We're stuck in here!

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:52.862
We're trapped, okay?!

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.698
What about the radio?
Can we get it to work

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:56.209
without the converter?
The comm won't work.

01:08:56.233 --> 01:08:58.535
But Alvarez might have a
portable one in his pack.

01:08:58.568 --> 01:09:00.937
On the floor.
Hunter, get it out.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.206
It's in that bag.

01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:05.108
Got it.

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:06.310
Anybody can hear this?

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:08.212
Come in. Terra
Nova, come in.

01:09:15.285 --> 01:09:16.586
We're going in circles.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.055
No, we're establishing
a search grid.

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:20.366
Well, what if they're
outside the grid?

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:23.126
Then we expand it.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.328
Can anybody hear this?

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:25.828
We need help.
Come in. Terra Nova.

01:09:25.862 --> 01:09:26.863
Copy that.

01:09:26.895 --> 01:09:28.965
This is Tango November One.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:30.099
Identify yourself.

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.734
Commander Taylor!

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:33.136
This is Hunter Boyce.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.304
We-We're stuck in a rover

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.839
outside the perimeter. Uh...

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:37.207
Is your rover

01:09:37.241 --> 01:09:38.442
operational, Hunter?

01:09:38.475 --> 01:09:39.709
Sixers jacked our power cells.

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.515
Hunter, do you
copy? Slashers.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.785
Say that again.
And say again about slashers.

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:56.226
Conserve your ammo.
Short bursts.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.327
Got it.

01:09:57.361 --> 01:09:59.329
Hunter, say again
about slashers.

01:09:59.363 --> 01:10:02.632
Uh, three, maybe more.
I can't see any...

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:07.671
...about 80 meters down from...
80 meters?

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:09.273
I said we're about
80 meters east...

01:10:09.306 --> 01:10:12.041
East of what?

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.178
Where is it?!
Grab it!

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:16.946
Josh, grab the radio!

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.980
Grab it!

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.384
Hello! If you're still there,

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:21.927
we're, uh, we're about
80 kilometers east...

01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:23.219
That's Josh.

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:25.021
Josh?

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.656
Josh, it's your dad.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:28.658
Could not copy
last transmission.

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:29.692
Please repeat.

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:32.028
Mom! Dad!

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.297
Is that you?

01:10:33.330 --> 01:10:34.631
Do you copy, Josh?

01:10:34.664 --> 01:10:35.865
Please repeat.

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:39.101
Josh!

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:47.143
Out of the way.

01:10:47.176 --> 01:10:49.178
My side's clear.

01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:51.348
Mine, too.

01:10:51.381 --> 01:10:52.616
You think they left?

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:54.183
Don't assume anything
with slashers.

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:57.787
Our gunfire drove them away for
now, but they'll regroup and come back.

01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:59.832
No, we should... we should make
a run for it while we still can.

01:10:59.856 --> 01:11:00.990
Make a run for what?

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:02.368
Terra Nova! That's,
like, five klicks away.

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:03.560
Tash, we'd never make it.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:04.804
We have weapons,
and anything is

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:05.795
better than being
sitting ducks...

01:11:05.829 --> 01:11:07.006
No, we don't know
how many of them

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.574
are out there,
and we have limited ammunition.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:09.942
Hey, hey, hey,
I might be a fresh, but,

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:11.444
I mean, Commander Taylor
got our distress call.

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:12.369
Commander Taylor
knows we're in trouble.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:13.670
We just got to hold on

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:15.405
a little while longer
for them to get here.

01:11:15.439 --> 01:11:16.749
It could take them
hours to find us!

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.183
Well, we have enough ammo
to hold off the slashers

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:19.619
a little while longer.
We can make it.

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:21.153
My God, he doesn't even know
what he's talking about!

01:11:21.177 --> 01:11:22.888
- Tasha, Tasha...
- They can smell his blood!

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:24.280
They can smell his blood!

01:11:24.314 --> 01:11:26.115
They're gonna come...
Calm down!

01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.916
We're not gonna make it!

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.652
Whoa, whoa! Tasha!
Tasha!

01:11:28.685 --> 01:11:30.354
Tasha, no!
Tasha! Tasha!

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:31.488
Hunter, stop it!

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:33.690
No! Tasha!

01:11:33.723 --> 01:11:34.891
It's suicide!

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:54.978
Hi.
Hey.

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:56.580
What are you doing here?

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:57.881
Well, with
everything going on,

01:11:57.914 --> 01:12:00.116
I wanted to make
sure you were okay.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.017
Yeah.

01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.419
You know, we're okay.

01:12:02.452 --> 01:12:03.553
Considering.

01:12:03.587 --> 01:12:06.189
Uh, we haven't heard back
from the search team yet,

01:12:06.222 --> 01:12:07.624
but, uh, shouldn't
be long though.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:10.594
I'm sure your brother's
gonna be okay.

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:12.796
Um, if you need
anything, just...

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.998
Don't go.

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:18.101
Uh, Zoe's scared.

01:12:18.134 --> 01:12:19.536
Right, Zoe?

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:27.043
This is Tango November.

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:28.912
I have all frequencies open.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:29.779
Hunter, do you copy?

01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:31.948
Josh Shannon,
do you copy?

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:33.016
This is Commander Taylor.

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:34.050
Just keep heading east.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.819
I think that's where
the signal originated.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:38.287
With all this technology,
shouldn't they know?

01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:39.423
Elisabeth.

01:12:39.456 --> 01:12:40.356
Anywhere else, we would know,

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:41.767
but this is some
dense jungle out...

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.593
Watch out!

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:47.363
Oh, God.

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:53.202
What's her name?

01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:54.103
It's Tasha.

01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:55.472
Okay, Tasha,
can you hear me?

01:12:55.505 --> 01:12:57.441
I'm a doctor, okay?

01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:01.578
I'm right here.

01:13:01.611 --> 01:13:02.812
It's me, Daddy.

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:04.648
I'm right here, honey.
I need you to

01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:05.891
apply pressure to this
wound. Here, here, here.

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:06.926
Tasha, you stay
with me, okay?

01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:08.452
Slashers came.

01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:10.854
Fired the gun...

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:13.657
Can you tell me where
the others are? No.

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:14.824
We'll get her safely

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:17.861
to the hospital as soon
as I stabilize her.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:21.865
Tasha, did you have to go
through water to get here?

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.900
I-I...

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:27.136
There's a stream about
a half a klick north of here.

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:30.807
Bracco, you stay here
with Guz and the doc.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:32.075
Yes, sir.

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:34.210
Rest of you, gather up.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.648
Put your hand there.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.251
Just in case.

01:13:42.285 --> 01:13:44.153
Jim, wait, wait.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:47.667
Look, I-I'm sorry about
what I said before.

01:13:47.691 --> 01:13:48.992
This is not
your fault.

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:50.627
Yes, it is.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.530
Josh came out here with
these kids just to spite me.

01:13:53.563 --> 01:13:54.864
Spite you?
No, he is you.

01:13:54.898 --> 01:13:56.933
Pretty girl and a chance
to break the rules...

01:13:56.966 --> 01:13:59.035
You'd have done the
same thing at his age.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:00.003
Well, you should know.

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:03.206
You were that girl.

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:07.811
Bring him back.

01:14:07.844 --> 01:14:09.078
I will.

01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:23.693
Max, say we make a run
for our rover.

01:14:23.727 --> 01:14:25.461
Are those power
cells usable?

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:27.740
This one's completely drained.
The other two are half charged.

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:29.499
If Hunter and
I cover you,

01:14:29.533 --> 01:14:32.702
how fast do you think you can
get those power cells installed?

01:14:32.736 --> 01:14:34.771
Maybe five, ten minutes.

01:14:35.672 --> 01:14:37.406
I say we make a run
for our rover,

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.876
power it up and get
the hell out of here.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:43.813
Hunter, check the
cylinders on our weapons.

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:45.414
We can do this,
you guys.

01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:47.183
Come on.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:58.261
Are you hurt?

01:14:58.294 --> 01:14:59.328
I'm fine.

01:14:59.362 --> 01:15:03.266
You're pretty good at this
whole taking charge thing.

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:07.771
Yeah, well, my dad was a
corporal under Commander Taylor.

01:15:07.804 --> 01:15:10.473
I guess he kind
of rubbed off on me.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.008
Was?

01:15:14.077 --> 01:15:15.712
Sincyllic fever.

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:19.115
Mom, too.

01:15:23.953 --> 01:15:25.321
Sorry.

01:15:25.354 --> 01:15:27.090
Whatever.

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:29.726
Everybody loses their
parents sooner or later.

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:33.830
What's not supposed to happen
is the other way around.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:38.134
Let's try to get the hell out
of here in one piece, all right?

01:15:43.807 --> 01:15:45.718
If we do engage slashers,
aim for the underbelly.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:49.012
Hides are too thick for the
tranq-guns to penetrate.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.581
Stay five meters
clear of their tails.

01:15:51.615 --> 01:15:52.982
Tango November,

01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:54.851
this is Guzman. Do you copy?
Yeah, I'm here.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:58.254
We're taking Tasha back to camp.
Doc says she needs surgery.

01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:02.058
Understood. Hey, Guz,
she's in good hands.

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:03.426
Keep sharp eyes.

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:06.095
Mira's your area. We picked up
Sixers' radio chatter.

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:07.631
Damnation!

01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:08.965
Copy that.

01:16:08.998 --> 01:16:11.868
Mira... just what I need
right now.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.178
Her people always
this much trouble?

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:14.971
Yeah, so far.

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:17.006
I don't know who sent them,
I don't know why,

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.984
but I'll tell you this...
I'm not going to let them,

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.910
I'm not going
to let anybody

01:16:20.944 --> 01:16:23.146
stand in the way
of what we are building here.

01:16:23.179 --> 01:16:26.282
Terra Nova will succeed.

01:16:26.315 --> 01:16:27.817
How's it
looking, Josh?

01:16:27.851 --> 01:16:31.487
Looks like we've got a clear run
to the vehicle.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.957
Okay, I think we're
clear on this side.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.291
This side, too.

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:37.002
Okay. All right, remember
to stay together.

01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:38.628
We all set?

01:16:38.662 --> 01:16:40.296
Look, maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:42.307
Maybe we... should just stay
here and wait for help.

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:44.200
We talked about this.
We can't stay here.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.635
Just take it easy, man.

01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:47.871
Look, if a slasher's going
to munch on any of us,

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:49.405
it won't be
your scrawny ass.

01:17:04.087 --> 01:17:05.154
No!

01:17:05.188 --> 01:17:08.024
Hunter!

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:10.226
Hunter?!

01:17:13.196 --> 01:17:15.364
Hunter!

01:17:29.913 --> 01:17:33.783
Hunter, are you okay?

01:17:33.817 --> 01:17:35.384
Give me a hand.

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:44.961
We've got to get into the
rover. What about Hunter?

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:48.664
I'll stay and cover him. You guys just get
those power cells in and get the thing moving.

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:03.279
I'm out!

01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:15.424
Come on.

01:18:47.891 --> 01:18:49.926
Flank and tranq.

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:52.929
Establish a perimeter.

01:18:59.135 --> 01:19:02.271
Keep moving, Skye.
Got you covered.

01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:04.974
Josh!

01:19:05.008 --> 01:19:06.109
Dad!

01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:08.544
Josh.

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:11.480
Get down!

01:19:19.989 --> 01:19:21.791
It's okay, it's okay.

01:19:21.825 --> 01:19:23.226
It's me.

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:25.294
It's over.

01:19:29.032 --> 01:19:31.300
Get him in the transport.

01:19:31.334 --> 01:19:33.136
Max, Max!

01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:35.471
Oh, God.

01:19:37.974 --> 01:19:39.142
You're going to be okay.

01:19:39.175 --> 01:19:40.977
You all right,
young lady?

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.646
Tasha... she-she tried
to make it back to camp.

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:45.281
Uh, huh, we got her.

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:48.985
You said there were Sixers?

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:50.319
Yeah, over there.

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:53.722
With me.

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:55.258
You're safe.

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:07.937
He's gone.

01:20:07.971 --> 01:20:11.908
Mira. She came
for her man.

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:19.315
Looks like they're back.

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:32.828
Let's get you looked at.

01:20:32.862 --> 01:20:34.597
Try not to put
too much weight on it.

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:37.300
I guess we know why they call
them slashers, huh?

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:07.964
I'm sorry.

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:09.332
It's okay.

01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:42.698
I want to say how sorry I am
for what happened today.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.934
I know.

01:21:44.968 --> 01:21:47.836
You know,
you've been so good to me

01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:49.638
since my folks...

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:54.710
I just don't like
to disappoint you.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:59.382
Well, you're still in one piece,
that's the important thing, huh?

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:02.385
Now you know why that
area's off limits.

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:05.121
Sir.

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:08.124
Well, it's slasher territory.

01:22:08.992 --> 01:22:11.094
Yeah, of course.

01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:19.468
So just what were you all
doing out there, anyhow?

01:22:19.502 --> 01:22:22.505
Dumb stuff.

01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:24.473
Drinking.

01:22:30.013 --> 01:22:33.416
You didn't go anywhere
near the falls, did you?

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:35.518
No, sir.

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:37.153
Good.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:41.157
Good.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.696
Those can be
some treacherous waters.

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.476
Someone was definitely here.

01:23:00.509 --> 01:23:02.645
Found footprints.

01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:04.113
It was those kids.

01:23:04.147 --> 01:23:06.149
Taylor's not
going to like that.

01:23:06.182 --> 01:23:08.217
He wants to keep
all this under wraps.

01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:12.088
Why doesn't he just
blast them off the rocks?

01:23:12.121 --> 01:23:13.822
'Cause they're
the only connection

01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:15.058
he has left to his son.

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:19.995
I still don't get why the crazy
bastard does this out here.

01:23:20.596 --> 01:23:22.165
Why do you think?

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:24.767
To throw it
in his old man's face.

01:23:27.236 --> 01:23:30.873
Every time he gets
closer to an answer,

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:33.476
he puts it here
for Taylor to see.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:37.946
To remind him... the real reason
for Terra Nova's existence.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:42.551
Control the past,
control the future.

01:23:43.286 --> 01:23:46.422
These are the key...

01:23:46.455 --> 01:23:48.657
to everything.

01:24:03.406 --> 01:24:05.274
Is it going to fall on us?

01:24:07.009 --> 01:24:09.578
Is what going to fall
on us, sweetie?

01:24:11.914 --> 01:24:14.150
What is it?

01:24:16.285 --> 01:24:19.355
That, my little Zoe,
is the moon.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:22.125
And no, it's not
going to fall on us.

01:24:22.158 --> 01:24:24.860
Wow. Almost forgot
what it looks like.

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:29.198
I was a kid when the air got so
bad you couldn't see it anymore.

01:24:29.232 --> 01:24:32.067
Was it always
so big?

01:24:32.101 --> 01:24:34.803
Not always.

01:24:34.837 --> 01:24:39.108
It moves about half a centimeter
away from the Earth every year.

01:24:39.142 --> 01:24:40.809
So it's much closer

01:24:40.843 --> 01:24:43.179
than it was yesterday.

01:24:43.212 --> 01:24:45.181
You mean tomorrow.

01:24:45.214 --> 01:24:47.283
You know
what I mean.

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:54.056
The sky is insane.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:57.260
This whole place is.

01:25:01.897 --> 01:25:04.167
The stars are all different
here, too.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:08.837
They're not in
the same place as in 2149,

01:25:08.871 --> 01:25:10.306
because the universe has had

01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:12.341
85 million fewer
years to expand.

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:13.709
I mean, do the math.

01:25:17.746 --> 01:25:21.116
We'll just leave the math
up to you, sweetie.
