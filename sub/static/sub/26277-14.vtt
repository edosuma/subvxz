00:01.168 --> 00:02.569
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.569 --> 00:04.771
I love you.
It's always been you.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.880
Maybe you can help me
get my life back, too.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.116
I went from entrepreneur
wunderkind to out on my ass.

00:16.116 --> 00:19.319
Excuse me.
Can we touch you?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.595
We're all but certain
the Major sent her to spy on us.

00:28.595 --> 00:30.497
What does she want
with our son?

00:30.497 --> 00:33.767
If I've learned anything
running point for 22 years,

00:33.767 --> 00:35.869
there's no need
to chase the enigma

00:35.869 --> 00:37.971
when it lives
right in our backyard.

00:37.971 --> 00:38.639
He's coming.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.440
He's almost here.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.512
I didn't mean to.

00:45.512 --> 00:46.980
But I killed
my little sister.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.482
Zeke:
Go back.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.816
Zeke: What the hell
was that?

00:50.584 --> 00:51.919
Michaela:
That was a calling.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.487
Maybe you're supposed
to come back with me.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.354
Go back where?

00:54.354 --> 00:55.622
Back to the world?

00:55.622 --> 00:57.557
I'm not sure the world
wants me back.

01:04.197 --> 01:07.100
Michaela: Here we are,
home sweet home.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.403
It's amazing how,
after 5 1/2 years

01:09.403 --> 01:13.273
and a new address, they still
know how to send you junk mail.

01:13.273 --> 01:16.043
I just hope, after one year,
somebody fed my fish.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.578
Um, Ben just moved out.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.948
The couch is free,
so you can crash here for a bit.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.115
No, no.
I don't want to impose.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.751
I can find my own place.
How?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.586
Look, Zeke, if you're not gonna
reach out to your family,

01:26.586 --> 01:29.056
all you've got are the clothes
on your back, and that's it.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.490
You don't need me
in your hair.

01:30.490 --> 01:34.628
Zeke, the petrograph --
that's about you and me.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.996
You've got to start
trusting me.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.397
I've been having
these callings for weeks.

01:37.397 --> 01:40.600
It wants us to accomplish
something...

01:40.600 --> 01:42.002
together.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.905
I just got
to figure out what.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.776
Okay. I fold.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.144
Thank you.

02:09.396 --> 02:10.931
I'm scared.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.567
Tommy Barber says girls
aren't good at science.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.736
Tommy Barber's an idiot.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.270
It's a pickle.

02:18.338 --> 02:22.109
Come on, Einstein.
You got this.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.314
You're the best
brother ever.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.049
I love you, Zeke.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.221
Michaela:
Ben left these.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.822
You can try them on,
see if they fit.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.891
Anything's better
than what I've got on now.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.226
It's like somebody
died in this.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.494
Cute.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.964
Um, hey, you should also try
and keep a low profile.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.365
Not a lot of people
know you're back.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.634
That's a --
That's a good thing.
Meaning?

02:47.634 --> 02:50.470
There are some military types
who are not very friendly,

02:50.470 --> 02:53.507
and, um, not a lot of people
have had the greatest reaction

02:53.507 --> 02:55.308
to those of us that came back
on that flight.

02:55.308 --> 02:58.612
So, I'm gonna guess
it's the same for you.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.213
Right.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.481
Yeah.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.556
Beloved,
my fellow passengers and I

03:09.556 --> 03:12.259
were sent back
to heal the world.

03:12.259 --> 03:16.963
And, already, the returned
are making a difference.

03:16.963 --> 03:20.200
There are police who have saved
people's lives.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.969
Doctors who have cured disease.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.509
We are miracles unto you.

03:29.509 --> 03:35.182
Blessed is Flight 828,
the vessel of the miracle.

03:35.182 --> 03:39.786
All: Blessed are the returnees,
the purveyors of that miracle.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.902
What's a petrograph?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.205
Rock painting.
Mick found one upstate.

03:58.205 --> 04:01.374
I'm trying to figure out how it
connects with Zeke coming back.

04:01.374 --> 04:02.476
Look.

04:02.476 --> 04:05.679
According to this,
petrographs in that area

04:05.679 --> 04:08.148
are hundreds
of years old.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.950
Nobody knows
who made them.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.251
First peacocks,
now this.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.787
I mean, do you think
they might be related?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.122
It's possible.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.557
I got to say,
this is a welcome sight.

04:17.557 --> 04:18.792
It feels good
to be home.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.193
Dad, check this out.
Huh?

04:20.193 --> 04:23.096
Petrographs database,
sorted by geography.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.732
Wow.
She's definitely your daughter.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.768
I'm not gonna argue with that.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.773
Sorry.
It's Mick.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.674
Finally. Where are you?
You okay?

04:34.674 --> 04:36.776
Yeah. We're back in the city.
We're at my place.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.111
Zeke, too?
Yeah.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.446
He's gonna crash here
for a couple days.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.815
And before you say anything,
I spent the last

04:41.815 --> 04:43.483
couple days with him.
He's one of us, Ben.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.519
No, it's -- it's a good thing
he's staying with you.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.088
There's a lot of hate around
about 828 right now.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.556
I don't even want to think
about what happens

04:49.556 --> 04:50.924
when news
about Zeke gets out.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.292
Yeah, well,
it's not a problem over here.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.361
Zeke's not exactly fired up
to tell the world

04:54.361 --> 04:55.862
he's back quite yet.

04:55.862 --> 04:58.965
Good.
Then you guys lay low.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.134
Saanvi's doing some research
to see what else Zeke

05:01.134 --> 05:03.670
has in common
with the rest of us.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.338
She's gonna get back
to me tomorrow.

05:05.338 --> 05:08.708
Mick, this isn't just about
the flight anymore.

05:08.708 --> 05:11.211
Everything's changed.

05:11.211 --> 05:12.946
We need to figure out
what Zeke's return

05:12.946 --> 05:14.581
means for
the bigger picture.

05:29.863 --> 05:33.233
Jared, what's going on?

05:33.233 --> 05:35.869
I don't know.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.505
Look, I know I promised
not to rush you,

05:38.505 --> 05:41.174
but the doc gave you
a clean bill of health.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.642
There's no medi--
Look, I know.

05:42.642 --> 05:48.048
I just --
I just need some time.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.688
Is Michaela back yet?

05:54.688 --> 05:58.124
I don't know.
Why?

05:58.124 --> 05:59.893
I've just been thinking
about her.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.664
What was that?

06:41.334 --> 06:42.502
Buddy.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.137
Ben:
You all right?

06:44.137 --> 06:47.641
It's okay, honey.
You just...fell out of bed.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.376
It's coming.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.419
Good morning.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.687
Traffic this morning?

07:00.687 --> 07:01.888
You're usually
three hours early.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.490
Today, only two.
Uh, no.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.258
I had to stop by
the Columbia med-school library

07:05.258 --> 07:08.094
and pick up some extra research
I'm doing for a side project.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.896
What? It's not enough
you cured cancer?

07:09.896 --> 07:11.564
You got to do
extra credit?

07:11.564 --> 07:12.832
Non-fat, extra foam?

07:12.832 --> 07:15.302
Mm.
You always were my favorite.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.839
Dr. Bahl?
Saanvi Bahl?

07:19.839 --> 07:21.207
Yes?

07:21.207 --> 07:22.609
I'm Alice Ciccone.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.644
I need your help.
My husband is sick.

07:24.644 --> 07:27.380
Oh, I'm sorry.
Alice, I do clinical research.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.149
I don't actually see patients
outside of my studies, but I --

07:29.149 --> 07:30.917
I know, but I heard you have
a new treatment,

07:30.917 --> 07:34.421
and my husband is, uh...

07:34.421 --> 07:37.424
I'm sorry.
We've tried everything.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.459
Do you think
you could just take a look?

07:42.896 --> 07:45.899
Okay.
Take a seat.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.200
I don't want
to get your hopes up.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.102
The treatment that we're
currently working on

07:49.102 --> 07:51.404
is only testing
for juvenile patients.

07:51.404 --> 07:56.343
I just need to know
if there's a chance or if...

07:56.343 --> 07:59.612
Please. We're supposed to have
the rest of our lives together.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.950
Did you bring your husband's
medical files?

08:03.950 --> 08:05.118
Uh, of course.

08:05.118 --> 08:09.055
His name is Jacob,
and this --

08:09.055 --> 08:10.990
I'm sorry.

08:14.060 --> 08:17.263
He, uh -- He sees a new doctor
this month, so...

08:17.263 --> 08:21.067
Jacob, he's always the...

08:21.067 --> 08:23.370
organized one.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.705
Always so many forms...
Hey, hey. Alice?

08:25.705 --> 08:28.074
Look at me.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.376
It's gonna be okay.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.678
It's not.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.447
If you can't help me,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.687
It was definitely a wolf, and it
was definitely not friendly.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.856
It leapt at me,
and then it just vanished.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.491
Cal had a calling
last night, too.

08:44.491 --> 08:48.128
We found him on the floor.
He said, "It's coming."

08:48.128 --> 08:49.929
What's coming?
A wolf?

08:49.929 --> 08:52.432
I know I've been gone a while.
We get a lot of those in Queens?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.970
It could be
anything...anyone --

08:56.970 --> 08:58.571
the Major,
the red x tagger,

08:58.571 --> 09:01.241
some threat we don't know
anything about yet.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.475
Where is Cal?
Can we not talk to him?

09:02.475 --> 09:04.277
He was up all night,
scared to death.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.545
He finally crashed
an hour ago.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.480
Can you stick around
till he gets up?

09:07.480 --> 09:09.916
I got to go to work, but that
doesn't mean Zeke can't.

09:09.916 --> 09:12.452
It's not like I've got
anything else on my calendar.

09:15.622 --> 09:17.624
Um...okay.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.001
Hey.
Where have you been?

09:28.001 --> 09:29.669
You haven't returned
any of my phone calls.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.138
Yeah, I, um...

09:32.138 --> 09:35.208
I needed a couple days
to clear my head.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.609
Mick,
you just disappeared.

09:36.609 --> 09:37.944
I know. I...

09:37.944 --> 09:41.014
I was hoping that I could get
some clarity on what happened.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.615
Did you?

09:42.615 --> 09:45.585
I can't get over what we did.
It's not right.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.454
We're supposed
to be together, Mick.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.190
Supposed to be or not,
we're -- we're not together.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.357
You're with Lourdes.

09:51.357 --> 09:53.493
I'm not gonna
take you away from her.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.394
I won't do that.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.029
You're not taking me.
I...

09:56.029 --> 09:57.363
Welcome back.

09:57.363 --> 09:59.065
I need one of you down
on the waterfront.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.601
Recovery of the getaway vehicle
from that armored-car heist

10:01.601 --> 10:03.036
that went into
the East River.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.137
That's still happening?

10:04.137 --> 10:06.105
Yeah.
It's going on four days now.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.574
At first, divers couldn't
go into the water

10:07.574 --> 10:09.042
because of the electrical
storm.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.443
Now they can't even
find the thing.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.145
How do you lose
a utility vehicle in the river?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.580
You got me.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.448
Isn't babysitting a little
below our pay grade?

10:15.448 --> 10:18.918
Well, this baby went for a swim
with $75 million stashed inside.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.320
Now, last night,
a couple of geniuses

10:20.320 --> 10:21.955
with scuba tanks
tried to find it themselves.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.792
So, the chief of detectives
wants a gold shield on-site,

10:25.792 --> 10:28.228
'round the clock,
till the thing comes up.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.296
How about Vasquez
takes the day shift

10:30.296 --> 10:32.799
so that he can be at home
with his wife, um,

10:32.799 --> 10:34.367
and I'll do nights?

10:35.869 --> 10:37.036
It works for me.

10:37.036 --> 10:39.405
Great.
Get a move on.

10:45.411 --> 10:48.248
It was just a nightmare.
I don't want to talk about it.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.983
Buddy,
it's -- it's okay.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.619
Zeke had a calling
last night, too.

10:52.619 --> 10:55.255
Cal, maybe you can help him
understand it.

10:57.757 --> 11:01.494
I saw a wolf.
Or at least I imagined one.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.430
You, too?
This is all new to me.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.667
I don't have the slightest idea
what it all means.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.202
Do you?

11:10.436 --> 11:15.742
Honey, last night,
you said, "It's coming."

11:15.742 --> 11:16.976
Are we in danger?

11:16.976 --> 11:19.145
Don't ask me.
It's his calling.

11:20.713 --> 11:21.681
That's okay.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.583
I don't want
to do this anymore.

11:28.087 --> 11:30.356
It's okay, baby.
You don't have to.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.296
Sorry.
He's not normally like this.

11:36.296 --> 11:39.098
I'm not great around kids.
He can probably sense that.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.970
Uh, give us a sec.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.246
Cal is afraid of something.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.747
Could it be Zeke?

11:54.747 --> 11:57.584
He rescued Zeke.
I doubt it.

11:57.584 --> 12:01.321
I think something's...
escalating.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.224
What?
It's just
a-a gut feeling.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.762
What's up?

12:09.762 --> 12:11.764
I've been texting Saanvi
about these new callings,

12:11.764 --> 12:13.233
but she's not
getting back to me.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.500
It's not like her.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.903
Why don't you go down
and see her?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.104
I can handle things here.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.472
You're okay being here
with Zeke?

12:19.472 --> 12:20.940
I won't take my eyes
off him.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.810
And you're right --
Cal rescued him for a reason.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.716
All right.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.718
Hey...

12:34.320 --> 12:35.888
Be careful.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.966
Thank you for coming.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.836
Since we lost the insurance,
nobody will come to the house.

12:50.870 --> 12:54.440
Okay.
You got to save your energy.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.709
You know, your wife
loves you very much.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.758
So...you think
you could help him?

13:11.758 --> 13:13.860
I'm sorry, Alice.
I wish I had better news,

13:13.860 --> 13:15.895
but there's nothing
I can tell you

13:15.895 --> 13:18.097
that your doctors
haven't already told you.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.666
But your treatment.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.135
Jacob's cancer
is just too far along.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.003
We've only been married
for two years.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.506
I've spent half of it going
from specialist to specialist.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.175
I'm not ready to lose him.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.777
I'm sorry, Alice.

13:30.777 --> 13:33.279
You and Jacob really should
be looking to make him

13:33.279 --> 13:36.049
as comfortable
as possible.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.817
What?
Until he dies?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.986
I'm happy to make
some recommendation

13:39.986 --> 13:42.021
for palliative care,
if you like.

13:42.021 --> 13:44.424
N-No.
I-I would not like.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.726
I want you
to make him better.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.528
Alice...

13:48.528 --> 13:50.363
You are returned.

13:52.331 --> 13:55.535
You were brought back here
to help, so help.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.670
You can cure him.
I'm sorry.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.439
I don't know where you got
that impression.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.606
I'm just a doctor.
Actually, you know what?

14:00.606 --> 14:02.442
I have to go.
No, no. Please.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.843
You're the only one.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.713
Alice, there is nothing
I can do to help --

14:10.016 --> 14:11.517
I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

14:11.517 --> 14:14.921
It's okay.
It's okay.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.122
I just really have to go.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.025
No!

14:21.060 --> 14:22.395
Alice.

14:27.366 --> 14:32.305
I told you,
you're going to save him.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.673
Get in there.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.644
Do what you were
brought here to do.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.352
She was supposed to call me
first thing this morning.

14:46.352 --> 14:49.021
Dr. Bahl misses one call,
and you come down to check?

14:49.021 --> 14:51.591
You're quite the friend.
Well, I am a little worried.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.426
Some of the passengers
are receiving threats.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.994
She seemed fine
to me earlier.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.196
Maybe she's just head-down
in some research.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.269
Let me call the lab.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.406
Hey, it's Cam.
Is Dr. Bahl down there?

15:09.709 --> 15:12.145
Thanks.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.446
They haven't seen her
all morning.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.114
They say she missed
a meeting.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.949
That doesn't sound
like Saanvi.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.451
Let me check her schedule.

15:39.238 --> 15:42.375
Ben says Cal experiences
the callings

15:42.375 --> 15:45.178
differently than
everyone else.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.813
Stronger.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.581
Thanks.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.682
I don't know how long
it's been since I've had

15:49.682 --> 15:53.219
a home-cooked meal.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.454
Speaking of home,

15:55.454 --> 15:58.658
have you reached out
to your family,

15:58.658 --> 16:00.426
let them know
you're back?

16:00.426 --> 16:02.728
You, too?

16:02.728 --> 16:04.297
No.

16:07.700 --> 16:12.772
Zeke...as the mother
of a returned son,

16:12.772 --> 16:16.108
I can tell you
that every parent wan--

16:16.108 --> 16:19.445
needs to know
their child is safe.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.848
With all due respect,
my family --

16:21.848 --> 16:23.983
it's a different
situation.

16:23.983 --> 16:28.454
And my coming back
feels like a fluke.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.856
Well, I don't really know
how all this works,

16:29.856 --> 16:35.027
but I know
it's not random.

16:42.301 --> 16:46.172
Could random...

16:46.172 --> 16:47.807
do this?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.946
That's you.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.848
Please don't take this
the wrong way,

16:55.848 --> 17:00.920
but my son risked his life
to save you.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.090
He thinks
you're important.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.259
That's no fluke.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.848
That's Ben Stone.

17:28.848 --> 17:32.151
Blessed is Flight 828,
the vessel of the miracle.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.755
And blessed are the returnees,
the purveyors of that miracle.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.932
Brother Benjamin.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.134
Adrian, what --

17:48.134 --> 17:49.402
Welcome to my church.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.504
Well, our church, really.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.072
What is this?
Some kind of scam?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.440
Not at all.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.576
Ben, this is my --
What was the word you used?

17:56.576 --> 17:58.611
My calling.

17:58.611 --> 18:02.848
When I came back, I had nobody,
but I found new purpose.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.417
It's to bring hope
to the world.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.420
Or to incite
dangerous beliefs.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.888
How can I help you?

18:08.888 --> 18:11.090
I'm looking for a passenger,
Saanvi Bahl.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.992
Last time I saw Saanvi
was at a meeting you called.

18:12.992 --> 18:15.728
Then why did I find
a flier for this...church

18:15.728 --> 18:18.431
in her office with her name
on written on the back?

18:18.431 --> 18:21.734
Have any of your...parishioners
taken an interest in her?

18:21.734 --> 18:24.670
Oh, they've taken an
interest in all of
the returned, even you.

18:24.670 --> 18:26.505
And why wouldn't they?

18:26.505 --> 18:28.407
We're saints.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.544
You've lost your mind.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.579
Ben, we came back
from the dead.

18:33.579 --> 18:35.448
If not to help others,
then why?

18:35.448 --> 18:38.284
Mind if I have a look around?

18:38.284 --> 18:41.554
Like I said, this church
is as much yours as it is mine.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.476
Alice:
We used to walk...

19:03.476 --> 19:05.277
Brother Adrian,
please help my...

19:05.277 --> 19:08.314
...faces his battle
with cancer.
Pray for us.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.615
My beloved Jacob...

19:25.164 --> 19:26.365
You have to help me.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.700
Your wife thinks
I can heal you,

19:27.700 --> 19:29.101
and she is going to hurt me
if I don't.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.836
I'm sorry.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.439
This isn't who Alice is,
but ever since I got sick

19:33.439 --> 19:34.907
and things
have been getting worse...

19:36.876 --> 19:39.245
She's not a bad person.
You have to believe me.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.546
I do.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.148
Lie to her.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.083
Tell her I'm healed.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.786
I am a doctor, Jacob.
I am a scientist.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.354
Lying isn't in
the playbook.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.156
Not even
to save your life?

19:50.156 --> 19:52.892
I'm already living
on borrowed time.

20:02.168 --> 20:06.105
Someone lied to me once,
and it didn't end well.

20:06.105 --> 20:08.207
What happened?

20:08.207 --> 20:13.879
Someone said they loved me,
but it was complicated.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.049
And we made plans to go away
to spend a week on the beach,

20:17.049 --> 20:18.150
hash it out.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.186
But then, when the day came,
only one of us

20:20.186 --> 20:22.221
showed up at the airport.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.123
What'd you do?

20:26.325 --> 20:29.795
I wasn't gonna waste
a round-trip ticket to Jamaica.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.565
So I went.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.267
I think you know
how that story ends.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.269
I'm sorry.

20:37.269 --> 20:39.438
You and Alice found love.

20:39.438 --> 20:42.708
That's the miracle.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.343
She needs to accept
the truth, Jacob,

20:44.343 --> 20:49.482
or she is gonna spend the rest
of her life regretting it.

20:49.482 --> 20:53.719
What was it like on the other
side, before you came back?

20:53.719 --> 20:57.256
I never went
to the other side.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.659
I don't even know
if that exists.

21:00.659 --> 21:04.029
I'm not ready to die.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.598
Neither am I.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.037
Hey.
Hey.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.673
Um, Jared's not here right now.
He's down at the river.

21:14.673 --> 21:15.741
I know.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.843
I came to see you.

21:17.843 --> 21:20.246
Can we talk outside?

21:20.246 --> 21:22.181
Yeah.
Of course.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.587
I was gonna talk to Jared,
but it sort of feels like

21:28.587 --> 21:31.023
I should start
with you.

21:31.023 --> 21:34.960
This is about us
as much as it is about him.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.595
Okay.

21:39.431 --> 21:44.236
Mick...is there something
going on between you two?

21:52.044 --> 21:53.646
Thanks.
That's all I needed to know.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.481
Please, please, please, please.
It was a mistake, okay?

21:55.481 --> 21:56.715
I don't know
what I was thinking.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.017
I-I wasn't thinking.
I regret it.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.818
Lourdes, he's supposed
to be with you.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.221
You figure that out before
or after you slept with him?

22:04.123 --> 22:05.791
How am I supposed to look
at Jared after this

22:05.791 --> 22:07.359
and not feel like
I'm the other woman?

22:07.359 --> 22:09.061
You're not the other woman,
Lourdes. You're his wife.

22:09.061 --> 22:12.498
And you're not just a random
girl he hooked up with.

22:12.498 --> 22:16.268
He loves you.

22:16.268 --> 22:21.173
And I can't help feeling
that you took advantage of that.

22:21.173 --> 22:24.410
I-I can't apologize
for still loving him.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.679
Lourdes, it was one month ago,
my time,

22:26.679 --> 22:28.948
that he was down
on his knees.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.350
I had a ring on my finger.
I was gonna marry him.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.251
Is that right?

22:32.251 --> 22:35.120
'Cause you told me that you were
gonna turn him down.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.189
What was I supposed to say?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.958
I was trying
to protect your marriage.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.193
Is that how
I'm supposed to feel?

22:41.193 --> 22:42.728
Protected?

22:42.728 --> 22:44.263
My marriage can't recover
from this.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.165
You broke it.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.366
You broke us.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.702
And you didn't even have
the decency to tell me.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.972
Decency?

22:52.972 --> 22:55.741
Lourdes,
you didn't even show up.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.376
I have known you
my entire life.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.813
You didn't even come to the
hangar to tell me to my face.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.314
And that makes this okay?

23:02.314 --> 23:04.650
That's not what I'm saying.
But, Lou, I know you.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.051
There's a --
There's a part of you

23:06.051 --> 23:08.454
that didn't show up
'cause you felt guilty.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.956
Of course I felt guilty.

23:10.956 --> 23:14.526
Guilty and scared
that I would finally find out

23:14.526 --> 23:18.430
the truth of whether he loved me
the same way that he loved you.

23:22.301 --> 23:24.236
I guess now we know.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.697
Gartrell: Vasquez!
Are you kidding me?

23:51.697 --> 23:53.432
Is this a spectator sport?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.434
They haven't even found
the damn thing yet.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.636
I've been freezing my ass off
for four days.

23:57.636 --> 24:00.105
What are they doing
down there?

24:00.105 --> 24:02.107
Jared:
Beats me.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.295
Go ahead.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.071
Hey, Cal.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.473
Your mom showed me
some of your drawings.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.241
Pretty cool.

24:37.576 --> 24:41.547
I-I need -- I need some help
with my wolf calling.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.282
You're an old pro.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.317
Think you can help me
draw it?

24:53.726 --> 24:58.564
Look, man, I know we just met,
but the thing is...

24:58.564 --> 25:00.099
the only person in the world
who I trusted

25:00.099 --> 25:04.636
and trusted me
was my little sister.

25:04.636 --> 25:07.306
And she's -- she's gone.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.744
But I could really
use some help.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.512
And I hear you're the guy.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.717
I can't.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.786
If I draw it,
it'll happen.

25:27.259 --> 25:30.629
Cal...did you see
the wolf, too?

25:33.599 --> 25:35.300
It's okay.

25:37.669 --> 25:41.073
And you think if you draw it,
you'll make it real?

25:41.073 --> 25:43.075
I brought you back
from the dead.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.212
Cal, I wasn't dead.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.281
I-I don't know what I was,
but I don't think you --

25:49.281 --> 25:53.018
you brought me
back to life.

25:53.018 --> 25:55.654
I get it -- you're scared.

25:55.654 --> 25:58.357
My sister
used to get scared.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.627
But she was stronger
than she thought.

26:01.627 --> 26:05.364
I think you are, too.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.000
I've got an idea.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.270
If you think your drawing
causes the future,

26:11.270 --> 26:14.673
then draw me this lamp
broken on the floor.

26:14.673 --> 26:16.875
Will that make it happen?

26:16.875 --> 26:18.177
That's not how it works.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.878
It has to come
from my head.

26:19.878 --> 26:22.681
Okay.
Then you think of something.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.583
Go ahead, Cal.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.719
Draw something fun.

26:27.719 --> 26:29.121
Okay.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.557
I'll draw you tall.

26:31.557 --> 26:33.659
Great.
I'd love to be able to dunk.

26:37.863 --> 26:40.766
Hey. Thanks
for pulling the address.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.769
It's down a block.

26:43.769 --> 26:45.037
You okay?

26:45.037 --> 26:46.371
Yeah, I don't want
to talk about it.

26:46.371 --> 26:47.873
Um, so, what makes you think
Saanvi was taken

26:47.873 --> 26:49.308
by one of these nutbag
believers?

26:49.308 --> 26:51.310
I found this
at the hospital...

26:51.310 --> 26:53.111
and this at the church.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.980
It's the same handwriting.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.081
And Cal and Zeke's
calling.

26:56.081 --> 26:58.016
Adrian
is a false prophet,

26:58.016 --> 27:00.619
a wolf's in sheep's clothing --
Matthew 7:15.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.789
Look at the atheist
remembering Bible verses.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.491
You looked it up,
didn't you?

27:06.925 --> 27:08.760
This is it.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.028
Stop.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.230
If Saanvi is in danger,
we need to know

27:11.230 --> 27:13.966
what's going on
in there first.

27:13.966 --> 27:16.668
Alice,
can we talk about this?

27:21.106 --> 27:25.410
Alice...let her go.
This has gone too far.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.313
Nothing's too far for you,
my love.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.249
How are you?
Are you -- Are you healed?

27:30.249 --> 27:32.184
Healing isn't on
the table anymore.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.186
We need to accept that.

27:35.521 --> 27:38.624
I am not losing you.

27:38.624 --> 27:40.526
Why didn't you
do what I asked?!

27:40.526 --> 27:42.494
I'm sorry.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.396
There's only so much
I can do.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.932
Look at me.
I'm dying.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.268
You are not
going to die!

27:49.268 --> 27:51.270
Alice, I have seen
a lot of couples

27:51.270 --> 27:53.572
lose each other in grief.

27:53.572 --> 27:56.475
What you two have
is very special.

27:56.475 --> 27:59.144
Please don't let your last days
together be this way.

27:59.144 --> 28:00.245
Stop talking.

28:00.245 --> 28:02.948
No.
Listen to her, Alice.

28:02.948 --> 28:05.284
I don't want your last memory
of me to be begging

28:05.284 --> 28:06.952
for some other
woman's life.

28:06.952 --> 28:08.320
Please, Alice.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.988
Don't you think
if I could heal him, I would?

28:15.394 --> 28:16.728
You're a liar!

28:16.728 --> 28:17.930
No, Alice.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.832
You healed the others!
Now heal him!

28:20.832 --> 28:22.601
Mick.

28:24.603 --> 28:26.171
Alice.

28:26.171 --> 28:30.042
If he dies, you die.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.010
Detective Stone,
Badge 9915.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.545
I need ESU
to 408 Cheever Street.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.815
We have a hostage
situation.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.984
ESU is 10 minutes out.
I don't think
we have that long.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.019
Ben, stop. Come on.
This could backfire.

28:41.019 --> 28:42.788
NYPD protocol
is to wait for backup.

28:42.788 --> 28:45.691
Well, I'm not NYPD.
No, you're not.
Can you please stop?

28:45.691 --> 28:48.226
Saanvi is in there because
Adrian is telling the believers

28:48.226 --> 28:49.928
that the passengers
can work miracles.

28:49.928 --> 28:53.131
So?
So, let's give her one.

28:53.131 --> 28:54.800
Ben...

28:57.803 --> 28:59.137
Alice: Hello?

28:59.137 --> 29:03.342
Alice, it's Ben Stone
from Flight 828.

29:03.342 --> 29:06.545
Adrian told me
you needed some help.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.681
Can I come up?

29:31.403 --> 29:33.205
Alice?

29:34.106 --> 29:37.542
I'm here to help.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.745
It is you.

29:39.745 --> 29:41.546
Can I come in?

29:41.546 --> 29:44.082
I knew a miracle
would come.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.452
Please, this way.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.464
Ben, she's got a gun.

30:02.534 --> 30:05.137
Alice...now,
there's no need for that.

30:05.137 --> 30:08.240
I'm here to heal
your husband.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.207
Put the gun down.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.342
No.
Fix him first.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.611
I will, I promise.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.946
But I need to be able to focus,
and I can't when you have --

30:14.946 --> 30:16.615
Heal him.

30:21.019 --> 30:22.621
Okay.

30:33.832 --> 30:37.202
You see? Brother Adrian
said they would help.

30:39.471 --> 30:43.075
We're waiting,
Brother Ben.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.577
It's going to be okay.

30:48.647 --> 30:52.017
Faith is compromised
by pessimism, Alice.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.785
Let's be optimistic.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.421
Put the gun down.

30:56.421 --> 31:00.225
Alice...please.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.235
Let us pray.

31:10.235 --> 31:13.105
Blessed is Flight 828.

31:13.105 --> 31:16.308
The vessel of the miracle.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.477
And blessed are those
who are returned,

31:18.477 --> 31:20.812
the purveyors
of the miracle.

31:20.812 --> 31:24.883
Alice...hold my hand.

31:31.022 --> 31:34.426
Blessed are those
left behind,

31:34.426 --> 31:36.895
for they shall
be brought to the light.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.497
Drop it!
Drop it!

31:40.565 --> 31:42.334
Please don't hurt her.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.582
Miss, there's
an ambulance downstairs

31:57.582 --> 31:59.184
if you'd like to go
to the hospital.
I'm fine.

31:59.184 --> 32:02.220
After what you've been through,
maybe you should see a doctor.

32:02.220 --> 32:03.855
I am a doctor.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.991
I have a patient I need
to go take care of.

32:05.991 --> 32:07.392
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

32:07.392 --> 32:09.828
Ben:
Okay, appreciate it.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.133
Is this ever gonna stop?

32:15.133 --> 32:17.602
Is this the new normal?

32:17.602 --> 32:20.572
At least you got your family
to get you through it.

32:20.572 --> 32:21.840
But I guess,
in a pinch,

32:21.840 --> 32:25.544
you're not so bad
as a big brother.

32:25.544 --> 32:29.748
I'm heading your way.
You need a lift?

32:29.748 --> 32:32.384
There's something
I got to take care of.

32:36.154 --> 32:37.689
Alice is going to jail,

32:37.689 --> 32:39.391
Jacob is dying
without his wife by his side,

32:39.391 --> 32:41.393
and Saanvi is traumatized
because of you.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.562
You're blaming me?
I have nothing to do with this.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.630
You made Alice believe
we can perform miracles.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.799
You have everything
to do with this.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.735
I-It made me sick
to even pretend.

32:50.735 --> 32:51.937
How can you live
with yourself?

32:51.937 --> 32:55.507
Because I'm opening people
to the truth.

32:55.507 --> 32:56.908
Miracles happen.

32:56.908 --> 32:59.211
After all, what was Flight 828
if not miraculous?

32:59.211 --> 33:01.513
Adrian, you and I both know
whatever happened to that plane

33:01.513 --> 33:03.648
was not the result
of divine intervention.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.116
Do we?

33:05.116 --> 33:07.285
You mean to tell me, in all
the years your son was sick,

33:07.285 --> 33:08.587
you never prayed for him
to get better?

33:08.587 --> 33:09.754
Don't talk about my son.

33:09.754 --> 33:11.456
You're afraid to admit it
to yourself,

33:11.456 --> 33:14.893
but Saanvi's cure was a miracle,
wasn't it?

33:14.893 --> 33:17.329
We live in a world where
airplanes full of people

33:17.329 --> 33:19.130
come back from the dead.

33:19.130 --> 33:22.534
Who's to say we aren't the
answers to the world's prayers?

33:27.272 --> 33:30.609
And I don't have
to believe.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.211
They do, and that's more
than enough.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.451
Now, if you'll excuse me,

33:39.451 --> 33:41.720
I have a flock
that needs tending.

33:54.399 --> 33:59.104
Adrian: Blessed is Flight 828,
the vessel of the miracle.

33:59.104 --> 34:03.241
All: Blessed are the returnees,
the purveyors of that miracle.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.543
Blessed are
the left behind,

34:05.543 --> 34:08.313
for they shall
be brought to the light.

34:08.313 --> 34:10.382
All: And blessed
are those who serve,

34:10.382 --> 34:12.918
for they make the light shine.

34:12.918 --> 34:17.622
Blessed is Flight 828,
the vessel of the miracle.

34:24.629 --> 34:28.667
I can tell by your look
that you owe me 10 bucks.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.703
How did you know Ben Stone would
be popping up again so fast?

34:31.703 --> 34:33.238
And what does this have to do
with his son?

34:33.238 --> 34:37.208
Clearly, the boy is special.
His father knows it, fears it.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.878
This is a man desperate
for answers.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.947
You want me
to bring him in?

34:41.947 --> 34:44.149
I want to see
what he does next.

34:44.149 --> 34:45.917
These people are a threat.

34:45.917 --> 34:49.688
Whatever power they possess,
our job is to understand it.

34:49.688 --> 34:54.693
That's the only way
to protect the country.

34:54.693 --> 34:58.363
Once we've done that,
if we can,

34:58.363 --> 34:59.965
we weaponize it.

34:59.965 --> 35:02.634
We have a clear line
on Ben Stone right now.

35:02.634 --> 35:03.735
Why don't we take it?

35:03.735 --> 35:05.937
Eye on the prize,
Jansen.

35:05.937 --> 35:09.808
Ben Stone is only a vehicle
to get to his son.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.877
Until we're sure the boy
is our Holy Grail,

35:12.877 --> 35:14.946
we sit tight.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.186
Hey, Dad.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.320
How was your day?

35:22.320 --> 35:25.323
It was...

35:25.323 --> 35:27.092
It's better now.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.399
You really are
your father's daughter.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.369
Wow.
You've been busy.

35:37.369 --> 35:40.972
This -- This is awesome.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.141
Okay, so,
that petrograph --

35:43.141 --> 35:46.344
it's a drawing of
the constellation Gemini.

35:46.344 --> 35:47.579
It is?

35:47.579 --> 35:50.415
From mythology,
like the peacock.

35:50.415 --> 35:52.150
The stars
were the giveaway.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.219
Gemini.
The twins.

35:54.219 --> 35:57.122
So, you think that's what this
could be about?

35:57.122 --> 35:58.623
Cal and I being twins?

35:58.623 --> 36:00.959
I don't know.
Maybe.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.310
Lourdes, it's Mick.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.446
Come on.
Please let me in.

36:23.815 --> 36:26.484
Lou, we got to talk.

36:41.766 --> 36:45.003
She's not home.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.337
Where is she?

36:46.337 --> 36:48.606
She's gone, Mick.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.982
Right after your text,
I, uh...

36:57.982 --> 37:02.754
I got my shift covered
and...came home,

37:02.754 --> 37:07.459
and, uh...she was waiting
with her bags packed.

37:07.459 --> 37:08.827
Jared, I...

37:08.827 --> 37:10.095
Why did you tell her?

37:10.095 --> 37:13.231
I didn't have to.
She already knew.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.066
This is not how
it was supposed to be.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.501
We're lying to ourselves,
Jared.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.002
She was always
gonna find out.

37:18.002 --> 37:19.671
Which is why we should have
come clean in the first place.

37:19.671 --> 37:21.406
That would have
never done anything.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.808
The hell
it wouldn't, Mick.

37:23.808 --> 37:25.243
That's the difference
between --

37:25.243 --> 37:27.145
between hiding a lie
and embracing the truth.

37:27.145 --> 37:28.713
The truth? What?
That we cheated?

37:28.713 --> 37:32.250
That we love each other.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.786
You know what?

37:34.786 --> 37:38.656
Maybe this was meant
to happen...

37:38.656 --> 37:40.625
so that we could finally
be together.

37:40.625 --> 37:44.395
We could start over
without any of the lies.

37:44.395 --> 37:45.396
Jared...

37:45.396 --> 37:47.232
Mick,
please talk to me.

37:52.737 --> 37:54.606
I got to go.
The divers just found the van.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.574
No, please.

37:56.574 --> 37:58.309
Mick, don't walk away
from me right now,

37:58.309 --> 37:59.777
after everything
that we've been through,

37:59.777 --> 38:03.348
the whole universe
conspiring against us.

38:03.348 --> 38:04.783
Mick,
I almost died for you.

38:04.783 --> 38:09.087
And I'd do it
again tomorrow.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.989
I love you.

38:14.859 --> 38:16.794
I love you, too, Jared.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.496
I want everything
that you want.

38:18.496 --> 38:24.169
But...Lourdes
just walked out.

38:24.169 --> 38:27.338
I can't --
I can't talk about

38:27.338 --> 38:31.376
you and me right now.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.178
I'm sorry. I...

38:46.157 --> 38:49.127
Come on, money.
Come on, money.

38:53.398 --> 38:56.534
Ew.
Tough luck, kiddo.

38:56.534 --> 38:59.003
I don't think your drawings
cause the future.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.773
I think they predict it.
See the difference?

39:01.773 --> 39:03.841
So, I'm not making
things happen.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.810
I just know
about them first.

39:05.810 --> 39:10.048
Exactly.
Big difference.

39:10.048 --> 39:11.616
But it would be nice to have
that money, wouldn't it?

39:11.616 --> 39:14.219
I guess.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.087
The thing is --
I still need your help.

39:16.087 --> 39:18.556
I still don't understand
what it means.

39:18.556 --> 39:20.592
But I think you do.

39:20.592 --> 39:24.362
Can you draw it for me?

39:24.362 --> 39:26.965
It wasn't just a wolf.

Here it comes.

40:56.554 --> 40:58.423
Ben?

41:08.533 --> 41:10.935
The body's
still inside.

41:10.935 --> 41:12.570
That long underwater?

41:12.570 --> 41:14.372
It's not gonna be pretty.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.428
Aunt Michaela?
