It's just another one of

01:07.700 --> 01:12.203
This man's writing about
a woman who lived in Vermont.

01:12.271 --> 01:15.907
Seems to me
they all lived in Vermont.

01:15.975 --> 01:18.509
What was so unforgettable
about her, ma?

01:18.577 --> 01:22.981
Well, she lived in this house
for 40 years with a big porch,

all these roads came together.

01:26.552 --> 01:29.688

and asked her for directions.

find her so unforgettable?

01:32.925 --> 01:36.127

Mike's friend, the artist.

He's an old friend of mine
from Chicago.

02:20.606 --> 02:24.175
He started painting
a couple years ago, and now
he's the hottest painter around.

We've got one of his old

03:54.800 --> 03:57.368
What the hell kind of
paintings are these?

03:59.571 --> 04:02.440
They're nudes, daddy,
but they're very abstract.

04:02.507 --> 04:04.442
Look,
here's one we love.

04:04.509 --> 04:07.445
It's called <i>nude in limbo.</i>
<i>You see?</i>

04:07.512 --> 04:10.614
There's her head,
and there's the long line
of her neck...

04:10.682 --> 04:13.184
And over there
are her shoulders,
and over there are--

04:13.252 --> 04:15.686
I know what those are, buddy.

04:18.790 --> 04:21.226
How come he give her
three of them?

04:25.030 --> 04:27.298
That's the way
he saw her, daddy.

04:27.366 --> 04:31.336
Geez, he must have been
bombed out of his skull
when he done this.

04:31.403 --> 04:36.007
The next time he thinks he sees
three of them, tell him to
take two aspirin and go to bed.

04:38.143 --> 04:42.680
Maybe it's a picture
of two girls
and he left something out.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.456
Take it away.

04:52.524 --> 04:56.361

for you, daddy.
Three what?

04:56.428 --> 04:58.462
- Huh?
- You heard me.

04:58.530 --> 05:01.432
You said,
"there's three of them,"
but you didn't say what.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.968
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

You can't say it,
can you, arch?

05:08.540 --> 05:11.475
A simple part of the anatomy,
and it sticks in your throat.

I got no anatomies
sticking in my throat.

to have some respect
for common decency, that's all.

Long before any of us

Leave me alone!

05:38.537 --> 05:40.471
It's a breast, isn't it?

05:40.539 --> 05:43.507
Edith, do you hear what
she's saying in front of
her own father?

05:43.575 --> 05:46.644
But that's what it is--
a breast.
She said it again.

05:46.711 --> 05:48.479
All she said was "breast."

05:48.547 --> 05:51.149
Now he's saying it
over there!

Well, let's hear you
say it just once.

"breast of chicken."

he showed me how
to do the breast stroke.

So? Jim mcnab
is our oldest friend.

Suppose I put your mother-in-law

without her clothes on?

10:18.817 --> 10:21.419
Oh, Archie, no!

Relax.
It ain't happened yet.

the pure form, it's art,
it's part of life.

but I don't want to look at it.

10:39.804 --> 10:41.739

One of the most talented
painters around today...

Flatters me by
offering to paint me,

so nasty.

Well, what else is it,
then?

10:54.686 --> 10:57.855
She's right, Archie.
Dirty is in the eye
of the beholder.

10:57.922 --> 11:01.525
And stupid is in
the head of the polack.

11:02.994 --> 11:04.928
I wanna tell you
something--

11:04.996 --> 11:08.031
don't start talking to me
unless you take that back.
All right, I take it back.

11:08.099 --> 11:11.569
Now sit down,

and let me talk to you.

11:13.605 --> 11:16.840

a little talk, man to man.

11:16.908 --> 11:20.311
That's nice.
Like father and son.

Well, maybe there's something
that needs doing upstairs.

11:24.816 --> 11:26.850
I'm sure there is.

11:26.918 --> 11:28.852
Now listen--

If you're gonna start in
again with that paranoia
about szabo, forget it,

and I trust him.

Oh, famous last words.

when he got it in the back from
his own brother with a cane.

out here--

11:51.843 --> 11:54.679
This guy is
way better looking
than you, buddy,

11:54.746 --> 11:56.681

ain't so hard to be.

11:58.249 --> 12:01.652
This could upset a girl.
You don't even trust
your own daughter.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.489
I didn't say that.
Now, sit down over here
and let me talk to you.

12:05.557 --> 12:07.692
Just sit down over here.

12:07.759 --> 12:11.595
Now, let me tell you
something about men.

12:11.663 --> 12:14.164
Men have got
certain things--

12:14.232 --> 12:16.900
hormones, see.

12:16.968 --> 12:20.003
Women have hormones too.
Theirs don't mean nothing.

12:21.340 --> 12:25.142
Now, a man's hormones,
they put ideas in his head.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.144
See? Ideas.

12:27.212 --> 12:29.279
And he goes around
thinking of these ideas...

12:29.348 --> 12:33.083
Until one day he has to
do something about them...

12:33.151 --> 12:35.319
To clear his mind.

12:35.387 --> 12:37.321
That's right!

12:37.389 --> 12:40.324
And when that day comes when
he's gotta clear his mind,

12:40.392 --> 12:42.493
he don't care
who he does it with.

12:42.561 --> 12:45.663
Now, I know guys that go after
the wife of their best friend.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.998
Come on!
What are you

12:48.066 --> 12:52.069

Gotta run now, buddy.
See you later.
See you, Mr. bunker.

13:03.348 --> 13:05.883
Are you going now?
Yes, I am.

13:05.950 --> 13:07.885
Thanks a lot

13:07.952 --> 13:10.220

thank you for my new model.

13:10.288 --> 13:12.356
Look at her--
she's a pixie...

13:12.424 --> 13:15.359

and the body of a woman.

13:49.761 --> 13:52.863

- Cut your toenails.

13:57.936 --> 14:01.371
your feet come over

runnin' up and down my leg.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.373

He talks to her
while he's painting,
and she loves listening to him.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.137
He's been everywhere,

a pile of inner tubes,

When did you start that?

15:27.792 --> 15:29.727

You wouldn't be jogging away
from any personal problems,

15:34.032 --> 15:36.466
What do you mean by that?
Actually,
it was my idea.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.536
I've been

You can do that by yourself.

16:24.382 --> 16:28.251
And you sit there
and you have no opinion at all.

16:28.319 --> 16:30.253
Oh, I got an opinion,

16:30.321 --> 16:33.057
but you never asked me
for it.

16:33.124 --> 16:35.926
Well, I'm asking you now,
Edith.

16:35.994 --> 16:40.297
Well, I'm not sure
you should butt in
where angels fear to tread.

Then we'll probably
grab a quick drink

when I came into the studio...

17:27.578 --> 17:29.880
And you were posing?

17:29.948 --> 17:33.183
How come when you saw me
you jumped up and--
and put my robe on?

17:33.251 --> 17:36.186
Yeah.
Why did you do that?
I don't know, Michael.

17:36.254 --> 17:39.489
It's just that szabo was there
looking at me his way,

17:39.557 --> 17:43.360
and then you came in
looking at me,

17:43.427 --> 17:46.030

17:46.097 --> 17:48.032
and suddenly I felt naked.

when you're upset.

23:44.422 --> 23:48.058
¶ It's the Japanese sandman ¶

23:48.126 --> 23:50.060
¶ he'll be here soon ¶

23:53.898 --> 23:56.099
well, meathead,
I hope you learned
something tonight.

23:56.167 --> 23:58.435
You should've heard yourself
on that telephone.

23:58.503 --> 24:00.904
What are you talking about?

24:00.971 --> 24:02.972
She was home at 6:00.

24:05.776 --> 24:08.378
Get outta here.

24:08.446 --> 24:11.381
I wonder why the sandman
is Japanese.

24:11.449 --> 24:14.884
He should have been an arab.
They got much more sand.

24:23.327 --> 24:25.228
Here's the painting.
Yeah.

24:25.296 --> 24:28.231
Szabo said we could
bring it home tonight
so you could see it.

24:28.299 --> 24:30.633
Oh, ain't that exciting.

24:30.701 --> 24:33.470
You ready?
Yeah.
¶ ta-da ¶

24:33.538 --> 24:35.305
oh, my.

24:35.373 --> 24:38.408
It's very nice.
Isn't it great?

24:39.444 --> 24:41.545
[ Mike ]
What do you think, arch?

24:41.612 --> 24:43.913
I knew it.

24:43.981 --> 24:45.915
There's one there,

24:45.983 --> 24:47.684
two, three,
four, five...

24:47.751 --> 24:49.686
Six...
