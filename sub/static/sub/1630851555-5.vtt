WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.466
-How did she get out of her room?
-I don't know.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.010
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:10.468 --> 00:13.596
-Did she take her pill?
-Yes. At 6:00 as usual.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.681
Alice.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.520
It's okay. Get the chair.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.481
It's okay.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.150
Calm down.

00:29.487 --> 00:32.115
-Take her to her bed.
-Are these letters?

00:33.074 --> 00:34.826
It's meaningless scribbling.

00:35.326 --> 00:36.453
Take her to bed.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.330
-Boss, these are letters, look.
-Now!

00:52.052 --> 00:54.637
SIMÓN

01:00.393 --> 01:03.313
She's never had a seizure
like last night's.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.939
What did you say to her?

01:05.023 --> 01:08.109
I told her about my father.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.528
Your father?

01:12.030 --> 01:15.575
I need to know his name,

01:16.284 --> 01:18.244
and only she can tell me.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.457
Alice's brain damage is severe.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.459
Her expression changed.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.377
I saw it.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.923
I know my mom is in there somewhere.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.768
-Pérez speaking.
-Any news?

01:41.851 --> 01:45.855
-It's all under control.
-Good. Don't take your eyes off of her.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.273
Okay.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.614
She'd leave the apartment if she knew.
She was there all evening.

01:54.697 --> 01:58.409
Tell Romero not to let her
out of his sight.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.162
Pérez relieved Romero at 7:00 am.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.873
I said I wanted no one else involved!

02:04.999 --> 02:07.710
Nobody knows why you're watching her, sir.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.629
And Romero needed to rest.

02:11.214 --> 02:14.217
-Mr. Bernardo is here, sir.
-Show him in.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.635
If you'll excuse me.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.144
-Simón.
-Bernardo.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.103
Simón.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.773
-How are you?
-It's so nice to see you. What's up?

02:29.566 --> 02:34.821
Today the president is announcing
your official nomination.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.866
-Congratulations.
-Great.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.659
I need more information,

02:39.742 --> 02:43.079
their jobs after Conaculta,
families, addresses.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.707
-Valentina de la Paz?
-Over there.

02:46.332 --> 02:47.167
Thanks.

02:49.627 --> 02:50.753
Thanks, Gregorio.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.216
Fifty-eight names? Give me a break!

02:56.384 --> 02:57.927
What are you doing here?

03:00.805 --> 03:01.723
Val.

03:02.765 --> 03:03.808
Listen.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.186
You were way out of line.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.813
I swear I'll keep my trap shut.

03:13.401 --> 03:17.280
There's an operation tomorrow.
You can come if you want.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.324
Chango again?

03:19.407 --> 03:22.410
He's back in business,
but we tapped his phones.

03:22.493 --> 03:26.247
-How?
-Teresa. Caridad helped me find out…

03:26.331 --> 03:27.665
Sorry. I need coffee.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.962
Gregorio Robles, Valentina's PA.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.924
Detective Lorenzo Márquez.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.468
-You're here for the investigation?
-Sorry?

03:38.551 --> 03:40.678
No, he's here for something else.

03:43.097 --> 03:43.932
Come.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.518
Nice to meet you.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.232
The Senate has 30 days
to make their decision.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.527
They'll put your life, your work,
under a microscope.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.071
Someone will come here,

03:58.154 --> 04:01.115
others will contact your son,
your wife, Rogelio.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.494
They'll make it look like a social call,
but be careful.

04:05.536 --> 04:08.122
They're bloodhounds hunting you down.

04:08.206 --> 04:12.543
-I told you I have nothing to hide.
-All that matters is…

04:17.799 --> 04:19.259
Continue. Sorry.

04:19.342 --> 04:23.304
As I was saying,
you just need to be careful.

04:26.140 --> 04:29.602
-Simón Marroquín. Leave a message.
-Simón, it's Susana.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.854
Catalina gave me your number,

04:31.938 --> 04:34.816
and you said I should call
if I needed anything.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.110
It's about Manny.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.113
Please call me. It's urgent.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.282
ST. JAMES ALMOND CAKE

05:03.511 --> 05:07.307
I'm having dinner with Mom today.
How about tomorrow?

05:08.391 --> 05:11.644
I have an important task to do. Wednesday?

05:12.895 --> 05:16.816
I'm going to Puebla on business.
You can come with me.

05:16.899 --> 05:20.611
I'm an employee on a schedule.
When will you be back?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.780
Friday.

05:23.364 --> 05:24.866
Let's meet at a hotel.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.162
Okay. The Urbano?

05:30.038 --> 05:31.164
At 8:00.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.668
No phones, laptops, tablets, nothing.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.839
We'll say not to disturb us
even if there's an earthquake.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.718
Damn fate won't have it's way this time.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.679
See you on Friday, Federico.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.514
See you on Friday, Valentina.

05:58.316 --> 06:02.737
Is the piece about the reform ready?
Congress is in session tomorrow.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.614
Yes. Hold on.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.206
Hi.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.959
I spoke with my grandma.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.380
She said nothing about the APB,
but she spoke with Mom.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.048
Where in the world is she?

06:23.091 --> 06:24.384
No idea, she didn't say,

06:24.467 --> 06:27.804
but she asked about me
and they told her I was in Mexico.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.223
What about your sisters?

06:30.306 --> 06:34.977
I can't tell my grandma about my sisters.
She'd have a heart attack.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.815
It's weird for my mom
to start calling me now.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.817
She always mailed me letters.

06:41.734 --> 06:45.071
What if she's been spying on me
all these years?

06:46.030 --> 06:47.407
You know what I think?

06:47.490 --> 06:50.410
She's the one
that planned my trip to Mexico.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.370
That's impossible.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.623
But, Pocho, where did Papá Antonio
get all that money?

06:55.706 --> 06:59.419
The store barely supports us.
He told me to move here.

06:59.502 --> 07:03.631
He said, "Go straight to Cancún,
then to Mexico City whenever you can."

07:03.714 --> 07:04.841
The postcards…

07:04.924 --> 07:07.427
The jerk that assaulted you
is part of the plan?

07:10.012 --> 07:13.641
Look, you can believe all that stuff
if you want,

07:15.017 --> 07:17.061
but you're not alone anymore, Mati.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.771
You're with me.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.400
You don't need your mom,
or your grandparents or anyone.

07:24.152 --> 07:24.986
Okay?

07:25.987 --> 07:26.821
Okay.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.283
Thanks.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.412
-The food is going to burn.
-Stay a little while.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.247
No, I…

07:49.510 --> 07:51.220
I need to tell her, Claudio.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.975
No, you said you'd get to know her,
and gain her trust.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.102
I didn't know she had sisters.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.397
She'll think you're a Judas
if you tell her now.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.732
Can't you see?

08:03.357 --> 08:06.777
As long as Matilde
doesn't know the truth about her mom,

08:06.861 --> 08:08.070
we can protect her.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.031
Okay?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.458
What time is the announcement?

08:21.834 --> 08:25.546
-You can't go dressed like that.
-I'm not going with you.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.007
You have to. You're my wife.

08:28.090 --> 08:31.511
But I'm not a Chinese decorative vase.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.389
And I have dinner plans.
If you had told me earlier…

08:35.473 --> 08:36.724
Okay. Don't start.

08:37.391 --> 08:41.062
I just found out.
Your girlfriends can wait.

08:42.855 --> 08:43.689
Damn!

08:44.649 --> 08:49.111
You don't need me, Simón.
You and Rogelio can handle it very well.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.615
-Let me see.
-I'm not done.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.995
No. The blue one suits you better.

09:13.094 --> 09:14.303
Have you seen Alice?

09:15.012 --> 09:20.768
Yes, but she had an anxiety attack
last night and she's sedated.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.354
Did the boss tell you that?

09:28.901 --> 09:33.072
She got up on her own
and tried to write something, Caridad.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.493
-Did she mention the pills?
-What pills?

09:38.494 --> 09:42.748
Some pills your mom was hiding.
That's not anxiety.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.626
Hugo.

09:47.378 --> 09:48.754
What's going on?

09:50.089 --> 09:51.173
That's all I know.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.635
But if I were you, I'd take her elsewhere.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.196
MENTAL HOSPITAL - MANAGEMENT

10:14.280 --> 10:16.449
SIMÓN

10:19.910 --> 10:21.037
Hello.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.747
Hi. What's the matter?

10:22.830 --> 10:28.085
Simón, Manny's missing.
I haven't heard from her since yesterday.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.422
She must be with a friend or a boyfriend.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.299
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.761
She won't take my calls
and she hasn't called me.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.387
I think something happened to her.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.183
Come on, Susana.
Manny can take care of herself.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.436
Aren't you worrying over nothing?

10:45.519 --> 10:48.814
No, that's not all.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.985
A guy parked in front of her condo
this morning

10:53.069 --> 10:55.696
and he keeps looking this way.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.200
-Do you know him?
-No.

11:00.701 --> 11:04.955
I'm scared. I'm calling the cops.
What if he knows Manny?

11:05.039 --> 11:07.500
Get out of there. I'll call you later.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.752
Don't worry about it.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.921
He's a driver waiting for someone.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.758
All day? No, I know she's in danger.
What do we do?

11:15.841 --> 11:20.471
I'm going to a very important event.
I'll call you as soon as I can.

11:21.138 --> 11:23.182
Are you in Manny's apartment?

11:23.265 --> 11:24.100
Yes.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.644
Stay there in case she shows up.

11:26.727 --> 11:30.773
And don't worry.
There must be an explanation for all this.

11:30.856 --> 11:31.732
Okay.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.902
Thanks, Simón. Bye.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.758
MEXICO CITY TAXICABS

12:20.406 --> 12:22.825
Here's the rent, Julia.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.119
If you want more clients,

12:25.202 --> 12:28.998
I'll give you a big discount
on fliers, calling cards.

12:29.081 --> 12:32.585
Maybe a nice poster for outside?
Whatever you say, dear.

12:32.668 --> 12:35.588
I'm giving it a try
with online advertising.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.589
MYSTICAL MAYA

12:36.672 --> 12:40.634
I just got an Instagram account.
I have 16 followers.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.640
Hang some cool stuff here every day.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.393
That'll make your groups grow faster.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.438
-Go that way, I'll go this way.
-Okay.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.148
Holy crap!

12:57.318 --> 12:59.153
Have you seen the print shop lady?

13:03.240 --> 13:05.117
Someone told your wife.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.953
She's kicking you out tonight.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.794
Let's go, Martínez.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.428
Thanks for not giving me away, sis.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.223
So…

13:28.849 --> 13:32.937
You can really see the future?

13:53.833 --> 13:58.337
-Let me help you.
-Excuse me. I'm looking for Manny.

13:59.171 --> 14:03.342
She hasn't shown up.
Customers aren't allowed in here.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.845
I know. Just tell me if she works today.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.597
Please, I'm her mom.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.141
Do I look like her nanny to you?

14:12.268 --> 14:14.353
Get out! Now!

14:16.605 --> 14:18.774
-What, Leches?
-There's a problem in zone 4.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.568
Damn it! I'll be right there.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.780
Are you really Manny's mom?

14:24.864 --> 14:25.739
Yes.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.535
-Nina.
-Susana.

14:32.162 --> 14:34.039
How much do you need this time?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.084
This time I need…

14:38.085 --> 14:40.087
$15,000.

14:41.171 --> 14:44.425
But it's all I need, really.
This is the last time.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.093
Please.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.137
Last time.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.558
Maybe eight or nine max,
or Simón will find out.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.018
Sure. Whatever.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.313
What I really need is an investor.

14:57.938 --> 15:02.026
I thought about Uncle Ignacio.
He's got two bars in California.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.653
I think he's interested.
What do you think?

15:04.737 --> 15:07.948
-If your dad finds out…
-I know, I'm dead meat.

15:08.991 --> 15:13.203
But if you don't say anything,
my uncle won't either.

15:14.038 --> 15:14.872
Okay.

15:15.706 --> 15:21.712
But only if you tell me
who's the girl you're crazy about.

15:21.795 --> 15:25.382
-I knew it. You're a busybody.
-Tell me, come on.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.468
-No, Mom.
-Come on.

15:27.551 --> 15:31.347
I'd rather wait
for things to cool off a little.

15:31.430 --> 15:35.434
-Just her name and where you met her.
-Okay.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.103
Don't laugh.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.275
It was destiny.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.988
-You promised not to laugh, Mom.
-I'm not.

15:48.697 --> 15:52.034
Seriously, the woman saved my life.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.619
Did she really?

15:54.745 --> 15:55.579
Yes.

16:01.585 --> 16:04.713
I even thought I'd die
before this ever happened.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.342
But your appointment is in 30 days.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.014
Thirty days, that's a long time.

16:15.683 --> 16:19.019
It's a month and I'm in perfect health.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.276
Bernardo says they need to run

16:26.360 --> 16:30.197
a thorough background check on me
and my family.

16:31.115 --> 16:35.494
We already knew that.
And we have nothing to worry about.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.248
Not you. Never.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.375
You neither.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.380
Unless you did something I'm not aware of.

16:54.638 --> 16:59.143
Simón! Finally!
Susana is worried sick about Manny.

16:59.226 --> 17:02.271
She's convinced someone hurt her.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.523
Why are you whispering?

17:04.606 --> 17:06.316
She's in the living room.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.403
She was sobbing her heart out downstairs.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.238
She says she phoned you.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.322
Susana?

17:12.948 --> 17:16.827
Yes. My sister. She's back from Spain.
Didn't Simón tell you?

17:16.910 --> 17:19.371
Can you come with me? I can't do it alone.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.376
Is that the Susana that…

17:43.771 --> 17:44.855
Pérez speaking.

17:44.938 --> 17:48.233
Pérez, where the hell are you, you moron?

17:48.317 --> 17:51.403
That's all Manny's coworker,
the bartender, knows.

17:51.487 --> 17:55.115
That she was so upset she never went back.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.869
Didn't Manny tell you a guy assaulted her?

17:58.952 --> 18:03.499
No, she doesn't talk much about her job
because she knows I worry.

18:04.583 --> 18:08.378
The same guy could've threatened her
or followed her.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.090
Someone's watching her apartment.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.591
Is anything missing?

18:13.759 --> 18:18.889
Is there any evidence or indication
that she was kidnapped?

18:19.807 --> 18:26.396
Her clothing, her laptop,
and a bag are missing.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.693
No, she's not on a trip.

18:31.777 --> 18:35.948
She won't answer my calls,
or my text messages, it's not normal.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.952
Well, let's wait.

18:41.078 --> 18:44.873
And if on say, Thursday,
we still know nothing,

18:44.957 --> 18:48.043
I'll file a report myself
at the police department.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.503
Okay? I promise.

18:50.129 --> 18:54.758
I know Manny's okay, Aunt.
She's one tough cookie.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.512
-She's fine.
-Yes.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.769
-Want some?
-No, thanks.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.147
Drinking alone is boring.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.234
What's your name?

19:18.073 --> 19:20.325
I see you come and go alone.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.536
And that body!

19:24.204 --> 19:25.914
I can just imagine you nude.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.961
Where's your man?

19:32.337 --> 19:34.965
What? You're not getting some today?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.969
These walls are made of paper.

19:39.845 --> 19:43.056
And the doors too.
It's better than watching porn.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.484
Let me in.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.696
No!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.209
What happened?

20:16.924 --> 20:21.303
I couldn't stab him.
I remembered what happened to Matilde and…

20:36.193 --> 20:39.446
You need to report the scumbag, Bautista.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.491
What for?

20:43.742 --> 20:46.954
So they'll ask
how I flirted with the lowlife?

20:47.454 --> 20:49.331
Or why I wear miniskirts?

20:49.414 --> 20:53.377
They always blame us.
As if you didn't know.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.051
Okay.

21:02.886 --> 21:07.808
Let's ask Lorenzo to at least
scare the hell out of the bastard.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.061
And when he sees I'm all alone?

21:12.396 --> 21:14.273
Moving is my only safe option.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.655
Didn't you…

21:23.365 --> 21:25.492
Didn't you see this would happen?

21:26.994 --> 21:28.704
That he'd try to rape you?

21:28.787 --> 21:30.831
I can't have visions about myself.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.126
Or do my own Tarot reading.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.129
It's as if the universe won't allow it.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.841
-But you saw the car crash.
-That's a weird memory.

21:44.594 --> 21:45.887
I'll make your bed.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.390
Valentina.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.187
Thanks.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.651
It's good to know who to turn to
when you need a hand.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.487
It's the least a sister can do.

22:09.703 --> 22:12.164
You can stay as long as you need.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.016
ALTERNATIVA

22:31.099 --> 22:31.933
Good morning.

22:33.935 --> 22:37.647
The guy I'm looking for
knocked up five women.

22:41.735 --> 22:42.778
He raped them?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.989
No idea, but I wouldn't be surprised.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.992
They didn't even tell their daughters.

22:50.619 --> 22:54.122
I found out from one of them
who's searching for her dad.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.666
And where are the women?

22:57.793 --> 23:01.296
Two of them died,
one has overdose-related brain damage,

23:01.380 --> 23:04.674
one is missing and nobody knows
who the last one is.

23:06.385 --> 23:10.472
When will guys be responsible
for how they use their dicks?

23:14.017 --> 23:15.727
What's up, bro?

23:17.521 --> 23:18.605
I'm fine too.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.734
Can we get together today or tomorrow?

23:23.235 --> 23:28.365
I can't, I'm very busy.
The prosecutor arrives on Wednesday.

23:28.448 --> 23:32.452
Today and tomorrow I'm with some mayor
who arrived today.

23:32.536 --> 23:36.289
-We can use the old presentation.
-Or whatever you've got.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.375
-Okay. Let me know.
-Fine.

23:38.458 --> 23:42.879
-But you owe me one, dude.
-Sorry. I have to go. Sorry.

24:00.689 --> 24:04.025
-Any women inside?
-No, they just meet here.

24:04.818 --> 24:09.448
These middle-ranking guys are the best way
to go straight to the top.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.993
So who are the ones on the list
you gave me?

24:13.994 --> 24:15.328
The owners.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.308
Who's that?

24:37.184 --> 24:39.311
No idea. I've never seen him before.

24:46.943 --> 24:49.613
Child, I don't think
anyone's hurting Alice.

24:50.197 --> 24:53.325
All the foundation does
is take care of her.

24:54.951 --> 24:55.785
Why?

24:56.912 --> 24:59.206
In exchange for what?
They didn't know her.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.627
Mother, please tell me the truth.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.171
I need to know the truth.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.465
The only thing…

25:09.883 --> 25:13.053
was her inclusion in the new treatments.

25:17.307 --> 25:21.144
It was her only hope, Caridad.
What else could we do?

25:25.857 --> 25:27.984
Dr. Zapata. Good evening.

25:29.194 --> 25:33.990
You asked me to report anything unusual
about Alice McAllister.

25:35.283 --> 25:38.703
It looks like she is responding.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.248
The bastards!

25:41.331 --> 25:44.751
Is that why Caridad's mom
hasn't recovered in 20 years?

25:44.834 --> 25:47.379
First we identify
the foundation's trustees.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.714
What did you say it's called?

25:51.758 --> 25:56.513
That's the worst part.
Having a female name on top of everything.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.767
The Eloísa Santisteban Foundation.

26:10.819 --> 26:11.987
What's that?

26:17.742 --> 26:19.536
How did that happen, Bautista?

26:22.205 --> 26:23.081
Tell them.

26:35.218 --> 26:38.805
IS THIS FATE AGAIN?
VALENTINA'S MARKET

26:42.726 --> 26:46.938
They'll be in session in 40 minutes.
I'll be in the car.

26:47.022 --> 26:47.897
Coming.

26:50.817 --> 26:53.236
I'll be at Palacio de San Lázaro all day.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.865
I need you to check out
the Eloísa Santisteban Foundation.

26:56.948 --> 27:00.910
Workers, founders, board of trustees,
I need everything.

27:00.994 --> 27:04.080
-Is this about that list?
-It's just a hunch.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.916
Eloísa Santisteban.

27:14.716 --> 27:17.093
-Good morning.
-You're here for the bags?

27:17.177 --> 27:18.845
-This is for you.
-Thanks.

27:34.402 --> 27:39.032
Mom, I hope you're okay.
Don't worry, I'm fine.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.576
I can't explain much right now.

27:58.426 --> 27:59.844
They just brought it.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.849
You still think
there are any clues in here?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.434
I don't know.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.729
It's all I have from my mom.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.442
HISTORY

28:14.526 --> 28:17.779
Eloísa Santisteban. The Marroquín family.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.329
WHO IS SIMÓN MARROQUÍN?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.500
Simón Marroquín. Leave a message.

28:47.100 --> 28:47.934
No.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.747
What? Don't you like that?

29:33.354 --> 29:36.399
Mrs. Catalina! What are you doing here?

29:38.318 --> 29:40.069
It's all a lie, Grace.

29:41.029 --> 29:41.988
Everything.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.283
This.

29:46.993 --> 29:48.411
This.

29:57.712 --> 29:58.713
Valentina.

30:00.381 --> 30:02.592
Someone else knows who your dad is.

30:03.301 --> 30:06.387
Did you know he had a daughter?

30:08.973 --> 30:11.684
No, right? Of course not.

30:12.852 --> 30:14.229
He didn't either.

30:15.647 --> 30:20.235
This letter was delivered a year ago,
but I never gave it to him.

30:21.694 --> 30:24.447
"You would've never heard from me again…

30:28.034 --> 30:29.953
but I'm dying.

30:31.162 --> 30:35.875
And my daughter Valentina,
your child, will be left all alone."

30:35.959 --> 30:39.212
Bastard!

30:39.295 --> 30:42.882
"Yes, Simón, I didn't get the abortion
you insisted I had."

30:43.675 --> 30:44.801
The Martínez woman!

30:44.884 --> 30:48.429
"I loved the child from the minute I knew
I was carrying her.

30:50.139 --> 30:52.183
Valentina knows nothing about you,

30:52.267 --> 30:56.479
and she never will
unless after all these years

30:57.522 --> 31:00.483
there's finally room for her
in your heart.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.570
Rosa Martínez."

32:30.907 --> 32:32.992
