01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:49.974
KELLIE:
What?

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:03.253
Too stupid to tell you.
It's just something Tuff did.

01:02:03.253 --> 01:02:06.423
I'll tell you when
I don't hurt so much.

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:11.195
Night.

01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:15.766
Night.

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:28.678
Want to thank you folks
for coming here today

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.214
on such short notice.

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:33.750
But Red Rock and I and Lane
have an important announcement.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.319
Lane's gonna try
the impossible--

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:37.521
to ride the unridable bull
Red Rock.

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:40.190
Red Rock hasn't been ridden
in 309 tries

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.992
by the world's
toughest bull riders,

01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:43.160
including Lane.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.929
Lane'll get
three chances.

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:48.432
The first one, April 17th,
right here in Sabine, Texas.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:51.368
If Lane succeeds, he'll write
his own page in rodeo history.

01:02:51.368 --> 01:02:53.237
Now, I'm sure you folks
have some questions

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:54.905
and Lane and I'll be
glad to answer 'em for you.

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:56.173

Lane! Lane!

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:57.741
LANE: Go and get you
something now, champ.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:02:59.709
Ah. No, thanks.
Appreciate it, though.

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:00.945
No, take it.

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:02.379
I watched you ride
ever since I was a kid.

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:03.747
I always wanted to give you
something back.

01:03:03.747 --> 01:03:05.816
Well, I got a spot
for this. Thanks.

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:08.052
Yeah.
Take care of yourself.

01:03:08.052 --> 01:03:10.154
Lane, why didn't you
tell me about this?

01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:12.189
You said we were coming
for a shirt promotion.

01:03:12.189 --> 01:03:14.691
Oh, well, I just wanted it
to be a surprise is all.

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:16.193
We're partners, Lane.

01:03:16.193 --> 01:03:18.095
Well, of course we're
partners. I know that.

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:19.363
What do you think
I'm doing this for?

01:03:19.363 --> 01:03:21.298
We got money, Lane.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.300
Well, he used to be
a world champion,

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.534
he had him a little
bit of money.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.070
Now all he's got's
his hand out.

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:27.304
I just don't want
that for us is the thing.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:29.406
We're never
gonna be like that.

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:31.475
Well, shoot, I know.
Red Rock's my guarantee.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:33.277
Your guarantee is us.

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:36.914
Of course it is, baby. What do
you think I'm doing this for?

01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:38.248
'Cause you like
all the attention

01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:40.417
and people
crowding around.

01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:42.219
So you don't have
to be alone with me.

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:44.754
This is the most
important day of my life,

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:46.290
and you're picking
a fight with me.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:48.758
Now I gotta go talk to some
of the people. You comin'?

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.194
Not hardly.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.003
ELSIE:
We wanted to add on,
but we never had enough money.

01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:00.404
It's gonna be great,
Elsie.

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:03.273
The corrals
that he's building for us

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:05.209
are gonna be right up there.

01:04:05.209 --> 01:04:08.879
Lane's been
so good to us.

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:10.948
I don't know where
he gets his energy.

01:04:10.948 --> 01:04:13.350
I've never seen him relax.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.585
We didn't even
have a honeymoon.

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:17.021
We did.

01:04:17.021 --> 01:04:19.924
Clyde didn't talk to me
for the first three days.

01:04:19.924 --> 01:04:21.425
On your honeymoon?

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:23.327
Finally I went to him
and said,

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:26.030
"What is wrong?
What have I done?"

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:27.564
You know what he said?

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.533
"They ruined my boots."

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:31.168
His boots?

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:33.037
Yeah,
on the wedding day.

01:04:33.037 --> 01:04:35.472
Some of his friends threw him
into the water trough.

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:40.410
It was, you know, just a joke,
but he worried and brooded.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.246
It's funny now.

01:04:42.246 --> 01:04:45.215
I see a lot of Clyde in Lane.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.416
But he's
a good man.

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:49.253
I couldn't have asked
for better.

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:51.989
Oh, heck, fellas. Why didn't you
tell me we was driving
to Spanish Fork?

01:04:51.989 --> 01:04:53.690
I told Kellie we was
flying there in the morning.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:56.593
Tomorrow's flight's
all full. Sorry, Kel.

01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:57.727
Lane, it's all right.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.563
No, it ain't.

Gotta go, gotta go, gotta rodeo!

01:05:01.498 --> 01:05:04.368
I got to see you ride.
You needed clean clothes
anyway.

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:06.370
Just give me
your dirty things.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.038
If Spanish Fork wasn't
big money,

01:05:08.038 --> 01:05:09.806
I'd turn around
and stay with you.

01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:11.008
Don't worry about it.

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:12.509
At least I got to see you
for a bit.

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:13.978
I'll call you
in the morning.

01:05:13.978 --> 01:05:16.013

Oh, I just drove
up to see Lane. Uh. Thanks.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.464
You'd figure world champion,

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:36.800
he could get somebody
to do his laundry for him.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.503
I don't mind.
That way, it's done right.

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:42.739
Hey, um...
want to get some dinner?

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:46.843
Thanks, but I should go.
I got a million things to do.

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:49.379
Lane's been gone so much,
it's really hard to keep up.

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:51.381
If I leave now,
I'll get back by 11.

It was good to see you,

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.518
Now, it's good
seeing you too, Kellie.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.526
Can I change my mind?

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.498
He gets up at 6 every morning
and jump-ropes or runs,

01:06:08.498 --> 01:06:10.034
then works in
the barn all day.

01:06:10.034 --> 01:06:12.669
At night, he watches
tapes of himself to improve.

That's on his day off.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.708
You've changed so much.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.744
Changed? How?

01:06:20.744 --> 01:06:23.947
I remember the first time
I ever saw you ride.

01:06:23.947 --> 01:06:28.418
It was at Ardmore about
five years ago.

Right before we
started going out.

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:34.458
I could see how much
you loved it,

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:37.027
how much pride
you had in racing,

01:06:37.027 --> 01:06:39.163
in beating your own time.

01:06:40.597 --> 01:06:44.168
I've been riding my whole life,
and I remember I was, uh,

01:06:44.168 --> 01:06:47.471
envious of the way
that you handled that horse.

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:50.307
His name was Crawford,
wasn't it?

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:53.210
Yeah.

If that's what he wants.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.502
Would he do
the same thing for you?

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:25.442
Yes. He would.

01:07:25.442 --> 01:07:28.078
It's not about him
or me. It's--

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:30.814

01:36:25.047 --> 01:36:30.318
* That never was his style *

01:36:30.318 --> 01:36:33.621
* Oh, we still miss him *

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:38.894
* Every once in a while *

01:36:51.806 --> 01:36:56.078
* Oh, they can face up *

01:36:56.078 --> 01:36:59.381
* To the tears *

01:36:59.381 --> 01:37:04.319
* And somehow
Still find a smile *

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:07.789
* But we only get 'em *

01:37:07.789 --> 01:37:12.527
* Every once in a while *

01:37:14.062 --> 01:37:17.399
* Oh, how I miss him *

01:37:17.399 --> 01:37:23.005
* Every once in a while *

[REBA McENTIRE'S
"IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN" PLAYING]

01:37:38.653 --> 01:37:42.557
* If I had only known *

01:37:42.557 --> 01:37:46.929
* It was our last walk
In the rain *

01:37:46.929 --> 01:37:52.500
* I'd keep you out for hours
In the storm *

01:37:54.102 --> 01:37:58.040
* I would hold your hand *

01:37:58.040 --> 01:38:02.410
* Like a lifeline
To my heart *

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:05.047
* Underneath the thunder *

01:38:05.047 --> 01:38:09.417
* We'd be warm *

01:38:09.417 --> 01:38:14.322
* If I had only known *

01:38:14.322 --> 01:38:19.461
* It was our last walk
In the rain *

01:38:23.431 --> 01:38:27.769
* If I had only known *

01:38:27.769 --> 01:38:32.207
* I'd never hear
Your voice again *

01:38:32.207 --> 01:38:35.043
* I'd memorize each thing *

01:38:35.043 --> 01:38:38.546
* You ever said *

01:38:38.546 --> 01:38:43.385
* And on those lonely nights *

01:38:43.385 --> 01:38:47.522
* I could think of them
Once more *

01:38:47.522 --> 01:38:53.328
* And keep your words alive
Inside my head *

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:59.434
* If I had only known *

01:38:59.434 --> 01:39:05.007
* I'd never hear
Your voice again *

01:39:09.177 --> 01:39:13.348
* You were the treasure
In my hand *

01:39:13.348 --> 01:39:17.785
* You were the one
Who always stood beside me *

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:23.591
* So unaware
I foolishly believed *

01:39:23.591 --> 01:39:28.563
* That you would
Always be there *

01:39:28.563 --> 01:39:31.466
* But then there came a day *

01:39:31.466 --> 01:39:35.737
* And I turned my head *

01:39:35.737 --> 01:39:41.309
* And you slipped away *

01:39:53.455 --> 01:39:57.792
* If I had only known *

01:39:57.792 --> 01:40:02.030
* It was my last night
By your side *

01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:07.369
* I'd pray a miracle
Would stop the dawn *

01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:13.408
* And when you smile at me *

01:40:13.408 --> 01:40:17.279
* I would look
Into your eyes *

01:40:17.279 --> 01:40:19.547
* And make sure you know *

01:40:19.547 --> 01:40:25.653
* My love for you
Goes on and on *

01:40:26.554 --> 01:40:30.725
* If I had only known *

01:40:33.895 --> 01:40:39.601
* If I had only known *

01:40:41.503 --> 01:40:46.408
* Oh, the love
I would've shown *

01:40:48.076 --> 01:40:54.349
* If I had only known *

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:02.056
TUFF HEDEMAN:
Don't be afraid
to go after what you wanna do

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:03.591
and what you wanna be.

01:41:03.591 --> 01:41:05.427
But don't be afraid to...

01:41:05.427 --> 01:41:07.729
be willing
to pay the price.
