Give me your phone, give me your headset.
I gotta get back online ASAP.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.883
I just made some big things happen.
Big things, baby! Boom!

18:00.960 --> 18:02.291
No.

18:02.360 --> 18:04.089
She's not with you anymore, bro.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.731
Hold on. Shut up. VVh-Why is
the soiled fool talking to me?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.962
I don't need you anymore, Charlie.
I'd like a divorce.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.407
[All ]
Ooh!

18:11.480 --> 18:13.881
Wait.
What are you talking about?

18:13.960 --> 18:16.160
I know you were gonna leave
me for the Queen of Thrones,

18:16.240 --> 18:18.368
so I've slept with Mac
to humiliate you.

18:18.440 --> 18:22.047
[ Chuckles ] She's humiliated you
and herself by sleeping with me.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.336
- I'm good at the game now.
- Oh, my God, Dee. You stupid idiot.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.850
Do you have a brain
in your head?

18:25.920 --> 18:28.969
I was tricking that girl so
that I could destroy her tribe.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.456
We're the most powerful tribe in the
whole game now! what are you doing?

18:31.480 --> 18:33.570
[ Gasps ] You know, I-l
guess maybe I hadn't

18:33.582 --> 18:35.451
really thought the
whole thing through.

18:35.520 --> 18:39.730
No, you didn't think!
Because you don't think!

18:39.800 --> 18:42.485
You're just a stupid
kept housewife, okay?

18:42.600 --> 18:43.965
Zing it, girl!

18:44.040 --> 18:45.963
Frank, shut the hell up!

18:46.040 --> 18:48.884
How dare you
all conspire against me!

18:48.960 --> 18:51.884
How dare you! You know what?
I want everyone out.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.849
Everyone get out of
my apartment, okay?

18:53.920 --> 18:57.003
No, not you, not you and not you.
The three of you, sit.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.242
Get out!

19:01.720 --> 19:03.563
Okay, I think
we can all agree...

19:03.640 --> 19:06.296
that this game is the most important
thing that ever happened to us, right?

19:06.320 --> 19:08.176
- [ Dee ] Absolutely, yeah.
- It's very important.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.407
That's true. [ Charlie ] It's
a hugely important thing.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.926
So, because I'm a nice guy,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.162
you know,
'cause I'm a cool dude,

19:15.240 --> 19:17.163
<i>I'll</i> let you live, all right?

19:17.240 --> 19:20.722
But, Mac and Frank, you gotta give
me your shares of Paddy's Pub. Done!

19:20.840 --> 19:22.330
What?
Yes!

19:22.400 --> 19:24.936
And, Dee, you're gonna have to do
all the Charlie work in the bar...

19:24.960 --> 19:27.327
from here till-oh, I don't
know-how's eternity sound?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.323
[ British Accent]
Stop, Charlie!

19:30.720 --> 19:34.088
This game has gone on-[
Accent Falters ] long enough.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.003
- Oh, shit.
- Are you doing an accent?

19:36.080 --> 19:38.576
- Yeah, I was doing a British-It was
a British accent. - That was British?

19:38.600 --> 19:41.524
I had it so good in my head. Oh, I was
doing a really good British accent.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.090
Doesn't matter. Anyway-

19:43.200 --> 19:46.010
Charlie, you think
you have all the power?

19:46.120 --> 19:47.724
Well, you don't.

19:47.800 --> 19:50.565
You see, the only thing
bigger than a king...

19:50.640 --> 19:52.165
is a god.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.925
You think you're a god? I'm the
one who's thriving, Dennis.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.002
I mean, look at me.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.003
You look like you're covered
in Hawaiian Punch.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.969
Yeah?

20:01.040 --> 20:02.565
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.889
I am the god of my own
universe, Charlie.

20:05.960 --> 20:11.285
I decide my own reality, and I've
decided all of your realities as well.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.648
So, you see, I unplugged it.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.006
You... unplugged reality?

20:18.120 --> 20:20.043
I don't understand what he's saying.
Me neither.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.521
I just-I deleted all of your
characters from the game.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.251
- What?
- I erased all your people.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.209
- How did you do that?
- Well, it was easy.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.656
You guys all have the same password-
“paddyspub.” [ Dee ] Shit.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.560
Oh, that's my password for everything.
Mine too.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.130
Yeah.
Why would you do that though?

20:33.200 --> 20:34.850
Why would you delete
our characters?

20:34.960 --> 20:36.736
Because the goddamn game
was irritating to me.

20:36.760 --> 20:39.445
I thought it was really stupid,
and it really is just, you know,

20:39.520 --> 20:41.296
sort of that simple,
so I ended the game, you know.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.845
That's the end.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.526
Doesn't have to be a whole big
thing every single time, you know.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.371
That's life. That's just
sort of how-how shit goes.

20:48.440 --> 20:53.526
[ Chuckles ] Sometimes
things just sort of... end.
