I can't turn him back.

I gave Bridget my powers,
and she tricked me.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.920
I can create a new Evermoor.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.800
The tapestry will fix lives,
not ruin them.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.520

you will give us your essence.

Is there a problem, Everine?

No.

Yes.

In Evermoor, we can live

15:50.000 --> 15:52.640
To do that,
we need to bring back the snoot cage.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.560
He's standing here right now?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.400
Yes.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.000
I hear him.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.080
But unpicking the stitching,
the eternal law?

16:07.160 --> 16:11.440
The whole tapestry's illegal.
The eternal law doesn't apply.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.560
-Ah! That's better.
-Otto.

16:27.720 --> 16:32.000
And now for the touch of a demigod--

16:34.640 --> 16:36.960
Not so fast.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.440
Where were we? Oh, yes, you know too much.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.760
Aunt Bridget, this is wrong.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.200
I have no choice, Tara. I made a promise.

16:47.360 --> 16:51.760
I have to release the Founders,
or we lose our perfect world.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.560
You're releasing the Founders?
They brought the world to chaos.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.280
They'll do it again.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.960
Well, I won't let you!

16:59.080 --> 17:01.120
I know.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.920
Hurry, girls,
you'll miss the lantern dance.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.760
(ALL) Yes, Great Aunt Bridget.

(DANCING MUSIC PLAYS)

18:03.520 --> 18:05.960
We must be three.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.760
We must be three.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.080
Still me.

18:20.520 --> 18:24.200
You defy my stitching? How?

18:24.360 --> 18:26.840
This jogged my memory.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.600
What do you think you're going to do?

18:34.760 --> 18:36.040
I'm the Supreme.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.360
I can fix every hole you create.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.520
I'm going to smash this lantern.

18:40.680 --> 18:45.280
If the Founders created this mess,
then breaking this thing should undo it.

18:45.440 --> 18:48.520
And lose Cameron?
The demigod didn't tell you

18:48.680 --> 18:51.000
of Cameron's fate
in the old world, did he?

18:51.160 --> 18:56.360
What about Cameron?
He was turned into a tree, Tara. By you.

18:56.560 --> 18:57.880
Tara?

18:59.680 --> 19:01.000
It's irreversible.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.560
In that world, I cannot sew.
He'll be a tree forever.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.120
(SIGHS) You want this too,

19:06.280 --> 19:10.000
or you would've broken through sooner.
You and I are the same.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.360
No, we're not.

19:19.120 --> 19:22.800
I'm sorry, Cameron. I'll find a way.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.400
No!

20:01.120 --> 20:03.360
Oh, no, it's meant to be like that.

20:03.560 --> 20:07.440
Ugh. Tara, you look like The Walking Dead.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.360
Tara, you're hugging me.

20:12.560 --> 20:16.320
You're not horrible, Bella.
You're just real.

We're back in the village
we founded, sister.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.760
A thousand years and little has changed.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.720
Where is the third? Where is our sister?

20:36.360 --> 20:39.800
The lantern was smashed in two
before her release.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.640
But we'll find her.

20:44.960 --> 20:49.720
And then the world will be ours again
to do as we wish.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.440
Until then...

Patrionat tuk Ecripé Mae!

21:20.840 --> 21:23.840
You did the incantation?
Thought I could do the same.
