00:02.040 --> 00:04.839
<i>- Previously on</i> The Flash...
- You never come back.

00:04.920 --> 00:06.320
You're not stuck here,
are you?

00:06.440 --> 00:08.238
- Bye, Cisco.
- Bye, Sandy.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.878
My father's death
certificate.

00:11.960 --> 00:13.952
The ME who signed off on it,
he doesn't exist.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.600
- So this death certificate...
- Is a fake.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.672
Who the hell are you?
What do you want?

00:18.760 --> 00:20.274
For all of you

00:20.360 --> 00:21.999
to die.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.360
What the...

01:35.560 --> 01:37.756
Damn, man.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.559
Another fight?

01:45.840 --> 01:47.957
Yeah.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.952
I'd hate to see
the other guy.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.633
See you on the floor.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.631
So you're not stuck here.

02:19.720 --> 02:21.552
No, I'm not.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.597
So they will reverse
tachyons in your system?

02:23.680 --> 02:26.036
Were put there
because of me.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.634
Are you kidding?

02:27.720 --> 02:29.456
You know how many credit card
points I just blew just

02:29.480 --> 02:31.472
trying to get rid of your
negative tachyons?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.376
<i>I just bought a brand new
spectral tachyeometer</i>

02:33.400 --> 02:36.518
when I could have
my Fiji get away.

02:36.600 --> 02:40.150
Not that I have
anyone to go with, anymore.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.197
I'm not taking you to Fiji,
Ralph.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.749
Why didn't you guys tell us
about this before?

02:52.760 --> 02:54.479
Oh, my God!

02:54.560 --> 02:55.630
Barry never returns?

02:58.360 --> 03:00.636
That's why
you came here.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.518
To see your father,

03:02.600 --> 03:04.956
because you
were raised without him.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.279
So what?

03:16.960 --> 03:18.440
Iris.

03:19.080 --> 03:22.357
So what that that article
says that you never come back.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.176
So what if the other one says
that you vanished.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.034
I mean, it's said other things
before, right?

03:27.120 --> 03:30.591
We made it say other things
before.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.320
So whatever the future brings,

03:33.440 --> 03:36.672
we're gonna deal with it
when it gets here.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.480
And change it if we need to.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.960
<i>She has a point.</i>

03:41.040 --> 03:42.997
If there's anything Team Flash
is good at,

03:43.080 --> 03:46.232
it's handing the future
its own ass and then some.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.274
What he said.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.238
Well, looks like Nora's

03:50.320 --> 03:52.835
gonna need more training
after all.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.709
Oh, okay.
She's hungry.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.029
Yeah, why don't we, uh,

03:58.120 --> 04:00.635
all meet back at S.T.A.R. Labs,
all right?

04:03.000 --> 04:07.313
Wow, first you meet your
adult daughter from the future

04:07.400 --> 04:08.629
and now this.

04:08.720 --> 04:10.757
I mean, it's a lot.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.273
Yeah.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.680
Well, I guess now I know why

04:18.760 --> 04:20.279
she never wants
to leave her dad's side

04:20.360 --> 04:22.829
and why she...

04:22.920 --> 04:24.479
Never wants to be by mine.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.678
Nora will reach out
at some point.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.832
The trick is you gotta keep
yourself busy.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.391
Yeah.
Thanks, Dad.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.999
<i>Joe!</i>

04:45.080 --> 04:48.039
Cecile?
Cecile, what's wrong?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.720
I can't hear
what she wants.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.751
I can't hear anything.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.633
I think I'm losing my powers.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.110
<i>Hey babe, uh, it's me,</i>

05:11.200 --> 05:13.317
<i>just checking in, for my dad.</i>

05:13.400 --> 05:15.312
<i>He...</i>

05:18.160 --> 05:19.514
- Hello there.
- Hey.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.990
- What are you doing?
- I was just trying to get

05:22.080 --> 05:23.514
Barry's new suit
into this ring.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.240
Oh, it's... it's tiny.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.996
Yeah? You weren't watching
old holograms of Gypsy?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.197
- Why would I be doing that?
- Because you miss her.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.112
We just had something
so special.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.793
Shouldn't it have worked?

05:35.880 --> 05:37.560
Of course, now it's
not so special anymore.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.718
Now she's just rattlin' around
inside my head.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.190
I'm sorry
this is so hard for you.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.296
But it's okay that you're
still thinking about her.

05:45.320 --> 05:46.879
I don't think you understand,
Caitlin.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.031
I mean, she's literally...

05:49.160 --> 05:50.640
inside my head.

05:50.720 --> 05:51.915
<i>I can't vibe.</i>

05:52.000 --> 05:53.514
<i>Everything I vibe
connects to her.</i>

05:53.600 --> 05:56.991
I put some music on,
I hear her voice singing along.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.311
I'm painting my figurines,
I see her face

05:59.400 --> 06:02.632
on Captains Kirk's body.
Shh...

06:02.720 --> 06:04.518
Do you smell that?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.637
Of course you don't.

06:06.760 --> 06:10.276
'Cause that's her perfume
and I'm only one smelling it.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.875
Of course.
Your powers linked you guys

06:12.960 --> 06:15.316
over pan-dimensional spacetime,
so it makes complete sense

06:15.400 --> 06:16.776
that your vibe echoes
would still be...

06:16.800 --> 06:18.154
Connecting us to each other.

06:18.240 --> 06:20.709
Yes, I know.
Thank you for the diagnosis.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.632
I'm sorry.
You don't need a doctor.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.632
You need a friend.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.156
I'm sorry.
I'm just...

06:28.280 --> 06:29.794
I'm a mess.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.519
Oh, perfect.
Been looking for you two.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.670
We need to talk.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.399
I've hit a real wall
trying to figure out

06:34.480 --> 06:36.039
who forged this
death certificate,

06:36.120 --> 06:37.736
so I was thinking maybe Cisco
could give this

06:37.760 --> 06:39.558
a little bit of a...

06:39.640 --> 06:40.920
Cisco is not available
right now.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.189
Please leave a message.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.192
Oh, hey, Cisco, it's Ralph.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.896
Hope you are doing well.
Just get back to me.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.513
I need to vibe this
as soon as possible.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.875
Bye, bye.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.553
Ralph, um, Cisco
can't vibe right now,

06:50.680 --> 06:52.990
so we're just gonna have to
deal with this a little later.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.879
Why can't he vibe right now?
What's going on?

06:55.960 --> 06:58.714
Because we need
to help him get over Gypsy.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.235
I mean, like you said,
Cisco gets his vibe back,

07:01.320 --> 07:03.755
- we can crack this case.
- Please, stop caring about me.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.991
Ralph, I mean,
you don't have any ideas about

07:06.080 --> 07:08.879
how to help a man get
over a heartbreak, do you?

07:08.960 --> 07:11.873
Oh, my God,
you stop it, girl.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.111
You know I have plenty.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.840
Cisco, you wanna know
why I'm the perfect guy

07:16.920 --> 07:20.118
to help you get over this and
get back into the game of love?

07:20.200 --> 07:23.557
Because trust me, buddy,
nobody, I mean nobody,

07:23.640 --> 07:27.077
has been kicked out of
that more than me.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.475
- Hello, Bobby.
- Vanessa Jansen.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.517
You got out of the slammer.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.398
Now I'm gonna loosen
up that chokehold

07:56.480 --> 07:58.119
you and that punk-ass
brother of yours

07:58.200 --> 08:01.318
have on all the big arms deals
in this city.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.437
I don't think so.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.991
What the hell?

08:07.080 --> 08:08.958
Do you know what four years
in Iron Heights

08:09.040 --> 08:10.076
will do to you, Bobby?

08:10.160 --> 08:13.995
It makes you very,
very angry.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.390
Vanessa,
you don't have to do this.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.949
Vanessa, please.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.672
Okay.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.736
So this is where
the Moretti brothers

08:42.760 --> 08:45.480
- have been running guns.
- Yeah.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.510
Stealing from these guys
takes some real <i>cojones.</i>

08:51.040 --> 08:52.952
Any idea who our
bold thief might be?

08:53.040 --> 08:54.952
Not yet.
Made my rounds too.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.874
So far the only prints belong
to Bobby and Bruno Moretti.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.120
Well, whoever did this,
they're running fast and loose.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.799
- Mm-hmm.
- If we don't stop this,

09:01.880 --> 09:04.056
a lot of high powered weapons
are gonna flood the streets.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.878
Central City is gonna be
a war zone.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.560
<i>Don't worry about the
city, friend.</i>

09:07.640 --> 09:10.155
CCPD's finest are on the case.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.756
- And you are...
- Nora, CSI intern.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.959
- Who are you?
- The captain of CCPD.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.999
Captain David Singh.
Oh, I've read so much about you.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.396
It's really nice to meet you.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.675
You hired an intern, Allen?

09:24.760 --> 09:28.720
I am very sorry, sir,

09:28.800 --> 09:31.269
but I needed help with, um,

09:31.360 --> 09:33.272
the cases that accumulated
while I was suspended

09:33.360 --> 09:34.720
and you said
the Mayor wasn't going

09:34.800 --> 09:36.056
to give us any money
to help solve them,

09:36.080 --> 09:39.039
so I hired an intern
to help for free.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.715
Mm.

09:41.800 --> 09:43.440
Well, make her official
when you get back.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.517
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.193
I know you're
surprised to see me

09:49.280 --> 09:51.351
but I found this badge
and this jacket and thought,

09:51.440 --> 09:53.477
"I'm a CSI too,"
so I should help my dad.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.880
Right, okay.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.416
You said you were still
a rookie, right?

09:56.440 --> 09:58.716
Well, yeah, but forensic
science in the future

09:58.800 --> 10:01.713
is, like, way advanced, so I can
totally handle a robbery scene.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.952
- Like, not a prob.
- Ah, got you.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.118
- That's great.
- What is that?

10:08.200 --> 10:10.032
That I haven't gotten to yet.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.555
But it looks like somebody
wanted their pound of flesh.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.279
- Nora, wait.
- Wha...

10:14.360 --> 10:15.776
What are you doing?
You can't touch that.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.075
You'll contaminate
the evidence.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.719
Sorry,
you mean you don't have

10:18.800 --> 10:21.156
a scene-wide modified
bosonic frequency field

10:21.240 --> 10:22.959
to avoid cross-contamination?

10:23.040 --> 10:26.078
I don't even think we have
some of those words yet.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.800
Oops.
Well... ugh.

10:28.880 --> 10:32.396
It's just this seems
way denser than human tissue.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.676
Yeah, you're right,
actually.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.600
I can't even move this thing.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.356
This isn't a pound of flesh.
This is a whole human body.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.558
That is so schway.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.256
Let's hold off on telling
the Mayor about this

10:48.280 --> 10:49.440
until we have some more info.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.439
She's still be upset
about the Lang homicide.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.952
Hey, Captain,
did you mean Gridlock?

10:56.040 --> 10:57.336
I thought he was locked up
in Iron Heights.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.397
Iris, it's a pleasure
to see you.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.995
Can we secure
the crime scene, please?

11:02.080 --> 11:04.675
You know I can't make
a comment on the record.

11:04.760 --> 11:08.595
Okay, well,
how about off the record?

11:10.480 --> 11:12.949
Just once and that's it,
and only because it's you.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.633
Okay.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.239
While in transport
to Iron Heights

11:19.320 --> 11:22.518
the convoy was attacked.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.274
Lang was killed
by something strong.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.955
- We think maybe a meta.
- Were there any survivors?

11:28.080 --> 11:31.596
Four guards.
They're still in the hospital.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.195
- So if you hear anything...
- Yeah, I got you.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.839
Thanks.

11:38.320 --> 11:39.834
<i>Put this away, and, hey.</i>

11:39.920 --> 11:42.071
- Here, put these on.
- Okay.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.391
<i>You do have...</i>

11:48.080 --> 11:49.753
<i>The Book of Ralph.</i>

11:49.840 --> 11:52.150
Yep, and we are gonna
start with a page of Ralph

11:52.240 --> 11:55.312
'cause he's nowhere near ready
for this whole book.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.552
<i>"Ralph Dibny's 27 steps</i>

12:02.640 --> 12:03.896
<i>to getting over
the love of your life."</i>

12:03.920 --> 12:05.400
Are you kidding me with this?

12:05.480 --> 12:07.437
We just want to help
you get past Gypsy.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.159
And if this has worked
for Ralph...

12:09.240 --> 12:10.469
Multiple times I will add.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.760
Then I think
it's worth trying.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.200
Come on, what's step one?

12:13.280 --> 12:15.192
Shark cage diving.

12:15.280 --> 12:17.397
- What's step two?
- Affirmations.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.676
- Oh.
- Okay.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.480
Ralphie is kind.
Ralphie is great.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.756
Ralphie is
a brilliant detective.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.559
Yeah, buddy, I mean,
I know all that.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.280
But it works a lot better
if you use your name instead.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.319
Cisco is creative.
Cisco is good.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.796
Cisco is smarter
than your average bear.

12:37.880 --> 12:40.111
That's Yogi's.
You stole Yogi's affirmation.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.714
Yeah, I did,
'cause it's a winner.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.712
You don't see him moping
over any lady bears.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.156
Okay, you know what, Caitlin?
I changed my mind, all right?

12:46.240 --> 12:48.152
I... I don't care
about the Gypsy vibes.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.560
I'll just muscle through them,

12:49.640 --> 12:50.936
let's just help you
with your thing

12:50.960 --> 12:52.416
and just get me the hell
out of here, please?

12:52.440 --> 12:55.080
No, Cisco,
after Ronnie and Jay

12:55.160 --> 12:57.800
you helped me get back past it.
Now it's my turn to help you.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.674
Okay?
So...

13:00.800 --> 13:03.554
We don't have time
to find ourselves in Thailand.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.200
And we are certainly not
watching <i>Beaches</i>

13:06.280 --> 13:07.634
while painting
each others toes.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.816
That's a really
important one, though.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.672
But step twelve isn't so bad.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.550
Holy Kafka.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.199
Come on, Cisco,
change is good.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.272
No, no, no.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.635
Change is pain.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.679
It's not as painful
as seeing you like this, buddy.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.353
Fine.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.597
Whatever you say, doc.

13:35.520 --> 13:38.911
Um, Officer Matthews?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.639
Yes.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.951
Hi, I'm Iris West-Allen.

13:43.040 --> 13:46.033
I'm a reporter, and I'm doing
a story about William Lang.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.238
- Gridlock.
- Pardon?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.073
You call him Gridlock.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.880
In your blog. I've read it.
It's good.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.079
Thanks.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.632
Um, I understand that you
were part of the convoy

14:02.720 --> 14:06.236
that was escorting him to Iron
Heights when you were attacked.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.119
- Something like that.
- What do you mean?

14:09.240 --> 14:12.358
I mean, I don't really
remember what happened.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.831
One minute I was in my vehicle.
There was a pile up,

14:15.920 --> 14:17.593
I got out
to see what was going on.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.032
<i>Everything went black.</i>

14:22.280 --> 14:24.400
<i>Finally came to and Lang's
laying there on the ground,</i>

14:24.480 --> 14:26.995
beaten to a pulp.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.151
He was beaten to death?

14:29.240 --> 14:30.435
Beaten, then stabbed.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.273
- Was anyone else hurt?
<i>- No.</i>

14:32.360 --> 14:34.272
Everyone in SWAT
was concussed like me.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.431
So, Lang was the only target?

14:38.080 --> 14:39.719
Looks like it.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.036
Thanks for your time.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.799
- Oh, hi, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Hey.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.998
I just...
I got a little too excited.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.673
Okay, guess what?

14:59.760 --> 15:02.559
You know my powers have
been fading in and out.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.074
Mostly out.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.551
Well, I am definitely
losing them.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.871
You weren't that excited
about that this morning.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.235
No.
No, I was not.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.392
But I'm excited now
because I have a fix.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.630
I have a fix!

15:15.720 --> 15:17.996
Mental activity dampener 2.0.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.355
2.0.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.711
Harry altered it so that
you can hear the thoughts

15:21.800 --> 15:23.029
of whoever is wearing it.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.759
And why would
we wanna do that?

15:24.840 --> 15:27.230
So we can make sure it works
before we put it on Jenna.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.714
Uh-uh.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.439
Oh, honey,
it's completely safe.

15:30.520 --> 15:31.776
Harry used it on
his own daughter.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.360
It doesn't mean
we have to use it on ours.

15:34.440 --> 15:38.195
Oh, ok... okay.
Honey, listen.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.432
I have had a constant

15:41.520 --> 15:44.160
telepathic connection
to our child

15:44.240 --> 15:46.152
since before
she was born.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.233
It's been constant.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.256
Babe, now when she cries
half the time I don't know why.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.670
Look, she's an infant.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.717
They cry and you don't always
get to know why.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.757
No, not... me.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.911
You don't understand.

16:02.720 --> 16:06.714
I haven't been the mother
to a newborn in a long time.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.995
When I got pregnant,
baby, I was so scared.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.029
But then I got powers.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.629
These powers that...

16:18.720 --> 16:22.760
gave me a chance
to be a perfect parent.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.356
The parent
that our child deserves.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.194
And now they're going away?

16:31.960 --> 16:34.794
I'm scared I can't live
up to that.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.954
I know you're struggling,
babe.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.952
But that device...

16:42.040 --> 16:45.158
isn't the solution.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.709
We'll figure it out, okay?

16:47.800 --> 16:51.032
But...

16:51.120 --> 16:53.316
I got it.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.714
Ugh,
these old-timey computers

17:07.800 --> 17:11.077
are even slower than the ones
in storage at the Flash Museum.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.800
DNA analysis used to take
a lot longer

17:13.880 --> 17:15.837
even just ten years ago.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.277
So, Mom took the news
about you being gone

17:20.359 --> 17:21.839
better than I
thought she would.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.832
Iris is
as tough as they come.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.195
I'm sure you know that.

17:26.280 --> 17:29.273
Got a match.
Vanessa Jansen.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.914
Low level weapons dealer

17:31.000 --> 17:33.515
affiliated with the
East Street Skulls gang.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.593
I ran into a couple of them
while I was in prison.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.433
- You were in prison?
- Mm-hmm.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.670
That wasn't in the museum.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.240
The Skulls make
the Hell's Angels

17:41.320 --> 17:42.656
look like a knitting club,
drug trafficking,

17:42.680 --> 17:44.114
armed robbery.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.431
Any places Jansen's
known to frequent?

17:47.720 --> 17:49.313
East Street Auto Haven.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.154
Looks like it's probably
a front for Skulls activities.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.551
Yes, I get to take down
my first baddie!

17:55.640 --> 17:57.916
Uh, with your permission,
of course.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.469
Let's do it.

18:05.720 --> 18:09.157
What is the hold up?
These are gonna move fast.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.758
Well, I guess I heard right.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.355
You got something
you're selling.

18:15.440 --> 18:19.400
Too late, another interested
customer just showed up.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.631
You're looking to buy, Bruno?

18:21.720 --> 18:25.509
From the broad who killed
my brother and stole our stash?

18:25.600 --> 18:28.752
This is way out of your league,
Vanessa.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.638
See,
I would've agreed with you...

18:30.720 --> 18:32.552
before prison.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.030
But then I got out
and it hit me...

18:35.120 --> 18:37.157
I'm tougher now, Bruno.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.360
I got connections
with people

18:38.440 --> 18:40.033
that'll pay big money
for my weapons.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.396
Except
they're not your weapons.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.794
Like I said...

18:52.520 --> 18:54.591
I'm tougher now.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.040
All right, I'm gonna take
Vanessa and the gangster.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.536
Why don't you
just scan the perimeter

18:59.560 --> 19:01.153
for any back up
she might have.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.596
- I can do better than that.
- What?

19:03.680 --> 19:05.319
Nora, what're you...

19:05.400 --> 19:06.914
Crap.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.590
Sorry,
I can't let you hurt him.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.400
Or take this.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.709
Didn't know I was a meta.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.752
Don't feel bad,
it's my new look.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.514
- Vanessa!
- The Flash!

19:22.600 --> 19:24.432
I guess I better put
my hands up.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.678
How long
do you think it will...

19:57.120 --> 19:58.873
I think Nora is good to go.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.679
She didn't even need
an Ibuprofen.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.076
- You sure you feel okay?
- I'm totally okay.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.913
Come on,
let's get back to work, Flash.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.673
Okay.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.656
All right, well, let's
figure out where Vanessa went.

20:08.680 --> 20:12.390
If she sells those stolen
weapons to the wrong people I...

20:12.520 --> 20:15.035
Um, Cisco, were you able
to get the satellite

20:15.120 --> 20:17.555
up and running?
Cisco?

20:19.600 --> 20:21.831
We weren't able
to track Vanessa,

20:21.920 --> 20:23.673
but we did find
a scientific anomaly

20:23.760 --> 20:25.638
that we've never seen
before, right, Cisco?

20:31.200 --> 20:34.671
- Han shot second.
- That doesn't even make sense.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.116
Ralph, it's you.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.600
Sorry to lie like that,
man.

20:38.680 --> 20:43.277
- We just... we need the CCTV...
- CCTV, yes.

20:43.360 --> 20:47.115
Vanessa Jansen's concentrated
air squares are dense,

20:47.200 --> 20:50.238
very dense, stupid dense.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.630
The kind of dense reserved for

20:52.720 --> 20:54.757
people who still believe...

20:54.840 --> 20:56.069
in love.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.720
I think what Cisco
is trying to say

20:58.800 --> 21:01.031
is that Vanessa can manipulate
the movement of atoms

21:01.120 --> 21:04.079
to created concentrated
air molecules in cube form.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.470
The space between the molecules
is so compact that...

21:06.560 --> 21:08.472
That there isn't enough room
for a speedster

21:08.560 --> 21:10.313
to vibrate through them.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.456
What do you call someone
who can compress air molecules

21:12.480 --> 21:15.314
- into solid blocks?
- I don't know, Block.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.038
So, I guess
Cisco is still

21:20.120 --> 21:21.376
taking the Gypsy thing
pretty hard?

21:21.400 --> 21:23.357
Well, we're working on it.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.954
But you can't expect
real progress

21:25.040 --> 21:27.236
till you hit step 17.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.391
It's this thing
we're working on with Cisco.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.790
You can do without us
for a little while, right?

21:31.880 --> 21:33.480
I mean, we're blind
without our satellite

21:33.560 --> 21:34.880
so we're just
gonna have to wait

21:34.960 --> 21:36.496
until Vanessa makes
her next move anyway.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.911
What about you? Gonna
hang around here for a bit?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.720
Actually,
I am working on a lead.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.474
- Huh.
- Can I use your lab?

21:47.560 --> 21:49.358
There's something
I wanna follow up on.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.238
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.439
Okay.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.079
Uh, what kind
of training is this?

21:58.160 --> 22:01.995
Well, speedsters need
to know about physics,

22:02.080 --> 22:04.675
aerodynamics,
trajectory formulas.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.474
And after your
last encounter with Jansen,

22:07.560 --> 22:10.394
I think it's time for you
to get back to basics.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.836
- My training is math?
- Yeah.

22:12.920 --> 22:16.152
I think chapter one is probably
a good place to start.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.399
All right,
you're in for a real treat.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.312
He initially said no,
but after I told him

22:23.400 --> 22:24.800
that your cousin
was John Stamos...

22:24.880 --> 22:26.473
My cousin is not John Stamos.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.119
...he agreed to take you on.

22:28.240 --> 22:32.200
I proudly present
my personal stylist, Bruce.

22:36.240 --> 22:38.277
This guy does it all,
hair, makeup.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.760
He picks everything I wear.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.513
- That explains that.
- Come on.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.399
Bruce is gonna help us
accomplish step twelve.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.278
Metamorphosis.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.216
Does that mean you think
there's something wrong

22:49.240 --> 22:50.515
with me?

22:51.920 --> 22:54.913
Even a Ferrari needs a
tune-up every once in a while.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.119
This feels like purgatory.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.956
You cut my hair,
I cut you.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.676
My work here is done.

23:28.320 --> 23:30.198
So...

23:30.280 --> 23:32.397
I hate it.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.199
I hate it all.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.795
Great. Now that that's over
and done with,

23:36.880 --> 23:39.349
why don't we focus
on the death certificate?

23:39.440 --> 23:41.193
Well, I mean, we
need you to vibe it.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.478
Or we can ask Joe to do some
good old fashioned police work.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.640
Did you ever think of that?

23:45.720 --> 23:47.393
Let's not worry about it,
okay?

23:47.480 --> 23:48.994
No, I mean,
it's a good idea.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.296
- We'll just, uh...
- Let's give him a call.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.199
Guys, stop.
Seriously, cut it out!

23:53.280 --> 23:54.839
Okay?

23:54.920 --> 23:56.400
Forget about the death
certificate

23:56.480 --> 23:58.915
and let's just focus
on helping our friend, okay?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.480
I need a break.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.040
Okay, so the key with
Higgs particles

24:14.080 --> 24:15.080
isn't the mass per se,

24:15.160 --> 24:17.755
but the effect they have
on the mass of other particles.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.797
- Yeah.
- Question.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.998
How would one go about
performing a supersonic punch

24:23.080 --> 24:25.151
on one of those particles?

24:25.240 --> 24:27.391
- Nora.
- Dad, I'm sorry,

24:27.480 --> 24:29.392
but I already know all of this.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.676
My high school textbooks
had laws of physics

24:31.760 --> 24:34.320
that this time
hasn't even discovered yet.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.676
I don't need
this kind of training.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.400
I need to learn
how to be like you.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.920
What do you think it means
to be like me?

24:43.040 --> 24:46.795
You know, running so fast
you can stop a tsunami.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.196
Or vibrating something bigger
than a plane.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.192
Or how about defeating
a sand demon

24:51.280 --> 24:53.397
by throwing lighting at him.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.834
Nora, look,
all those things

24:54.920 --> 24:56.639
are way beyond
your current skill level.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.952
<i>You gotta stick to what
you can handle right now.</i>

25:00.040 --> 25:01.713
You know, just because
I'm your daughter

25:01.800 --> 25:04.190
doesn't mean you have
to baby me.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.795
I can handle
way more than you think.

25:07.880 --> 25:09.678
Watch.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.554
Dad!

25:28.640 --> 25:30.472
- Dad, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.153
I've been hit
with lighting before.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.436
Ow.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.830
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.354
I guess
greatness isn't hereditary.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.435
Body cam footage.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.876
Officer Matthews.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.394
Bingo!

26:05.560 --> 26:07.153
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

26:07.240 --> 26:08.776
<i>Stay where you are.
Freeze. Don't move.</i>

26:10.720 --> 26:13.235
What was that?

26:26.960 --> 26:29.873
Hey, I need your help.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.680
- That's blunt.
- Yeah, so Nora

26:32.760 --> 26:34.360
isn't really spending any time
with Iris.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.256
So she's kind of with me
all the time, you know?

26:36.280 --> 26:38.033
And I've been training
her a lot by myself

26:38.120 --> 26:40.351
and I just don't get it.

26:40.440 --> 26:41.556
I mean, it's like...

26:41.640 --> 26:43.871
she keeps taking things on
that she can't handle yet.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.917
It's like she wants
to go big for big's sake

26:46.040 --> 26:47.296
and I've tried to walk her back,

26:47.320 --> 26:48.800
but it's like
she's not listening

26:48.880 --> 26:50.240
to what I'm teaching her,
you know?

26:50.280 --> 26:51.576
It's actually like she hears
the opposite

26:51.600 --> 26:53.910
of what I'm saying.
Why are you nodding?

26:54.000 --> 26:55.480
Are you agreeing with me?

26:55.560 --> 26:59.554
Do you remember
your 4th grade science fair?

27:01.280 --> 27:03.920
Yeah, but what does that
have to do with this?

27:04.000 --> 27:06.276
All you had to do was make
a baking soda volcano.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.760
- And what did you do?
- I...

27:07.840 --> 27:11.231
You built a robot
with wheels,

27:11.320 --> 27:13.391
pretty much set
the gym on fire.

27:13.480 --> 27:15.551
Almost got Mrs. Dumas too.

27:15.640 --> 27:18.075
- But that was different.
- How so?

27:18.160 --> 27:21.358
That was the first year
you took me in.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.716
I mean, you took me
when I had no one.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.598
I looked up to you.
I mean, you were my hero.

27:25.680 --> 27:27.319
I...

27:31.680 --> 27:33.637
I really wanted to impress you.

27:33.720 --> 27:36.679
Bar, all the information

27:36.800 --> 27:40.157
this girl has on you
comes from that museum.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.233
There're literally statues

27:43.320 --> 27:45.994
of you on pedestals.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.959
How much do you think she wants
to impress her hero?

27:51.080 --> 27:53.231
So what do I do?

27:53.320 --> 27:56.119
Well, show her
it's okay not to be perfect

27:56.200 --> 27:57.554
coming out of the gate.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.836
There's no shortcuts.

27:59.920 --> 28:02.799
Takes time to get things right
and that's not a failure.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.997
<i>That's life.</i>

28:05.120 --> 28:09.831
<i>And also show her
that no matter what</i>

28:09.920 --> 28:13.436
<i>you're always gonna love her.</i>

28:13.520 --> 28:16.718
<i>That's what parents do.</i>

28:16.840 --> 28:18.399
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:18.480 --> 28:20.870
<i>- Yeah, thanks, Joe.
- Mm.</i>

28:20.960 --> 28:23.395
See you later.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.151
Mm.
Mm.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.038
Mm.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.430
What was that for?

28:37.520 --> 28:39.796
Just 'cause.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.792
Uh-uh.
I got her.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.194
Yeah, you do.

28:57.920 --> 29:01.800
Ah, yes,
the sugary pastry.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.315
I think as far as avoiding
your feelings goes,

29:04.400 --> 29:07.757
cinnamon bun
was a solid choice.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.036
You look nice.

29:10.120 --> 29:13.716
Yeah, well, I think Bruce
burned all my clothes, so...

29:13.800 --> 29:15.678
Hmm.

29:18.640 --> 29:19.920
Why don't you want
to investigate

29:20.000 --> 29:22.515
your dad's
death certificate?

29:26.640 --> 29:29.109
Because...

29:29.200 --> 29:32.238
if it's true...

29:32.320 --> 29:35.757
if he has been alive
this whole time...

29:37.080 --> 29:39.037
It just means
he didn't want to see me.

29:54.840 --> 29:57.116
Accept that she isn't
the love of your life

29:57.200 --> 30:00.671
because if she were,
she'd still be in it.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.832
- Pretty deep for Ralph Dibny.
- Yeah.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.354
Granted, it took him 26 swings
before he could hit the ball.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.993
I don't know...

30:16.080 --> 30:18.549
I think he might have knocked
out of the park with that one.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.191
Gypsy isn't the one.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.039
<i>I know that.</i>

30:27.200 --> 30:30.511
And there's no amount
of new clothes or...

30:30.640 --> 30:33.917
crazy makeover distractions
that can change that fact.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.155
Because some truths you can
only hide from for so long.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.669
The truth is, it's too late for
me to change things with her.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.511
But it's not too late for you.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.839
It's not too late for you
to change things with your dad.

31:00.280 --> 31:03.876
But what if he doesn't want
anything to do with me?

31:09.640 --> 31:11.711
Maybe he doesn't.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.912
But wouldn't you rather
face that truth

31:17.000 --> 31:19.959
instead of spending the rest
of your life wondering?

31:29.000 --> 31:31.515
- Is this part of my training?
- Just watch.

31:33.080 --> 31:36.232
- Schway, is that you?
- Yeah.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.959
A few weeks
after I got my powers.

31:38.080 --> 31:41.152
OG Flash.
God, look at you move.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.118
Yeah, just wait for it.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.156
And this.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.240
And this.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.152
- Yeah.
- Oh!

31:50.240 --> 31:53.074
It takes time
to hone your skills, Nora.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.976
<i>You can'tjust can't
just skip rungs on the ladder</i>

31:55.000 --> 31:57.674
or jump right to the big stuff.
It's not how it works.

31:59.320 --> 32:01.073
All right,
that's enough of that.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.152
Look, when you first got here

32:03.240 --> 32:06.756
you said that you weren't
a great speedster.

32:06.840 --> 32:10.311
But obviously neither was I
when I first started.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.280
Um, do you think one day
I'll be great like you?

32:16.240 --> 32:18.152
You punched out a satellite

32:18.240 --> 32:21.074
while it was falling
to the earth and on fire.

32:21.160 --> 32:22.992
And you were moving so fast

32:23.080 --> 32:25.549
even I couldn't
see who you were.

32:25.640 --> 32:28.314
- Yeah, that was pretty epic.
- Yeah.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.158
I'm sorry I didn't listen
to you today.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.436
I just wanted to make
you proud.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.873
Sometimes for people
with our abilities

32:39.960 --> 32:44.193
the most impressive feat
is restraint.

32:50.800 --> 32:53.315
I want what's mine, Vanessa.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.400
Now step aside.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.954
Because you brought
a bigger gun this time?

33:00.080 --> 33:01.150
Not happening.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.959
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.280
I'm sure.

33:25.760 --> 33:28.400
Hey, guys.
Any luck with Block?

33:28.480 --> 33:30.199
Nothing. No.
Anything at the lab?

33:30.280 --> 33:33.352
Uh, maybe. It's still
a little too early to tell.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.477
<i>Unit 7-5-2
requesting a 10-61.</i>

33:35.560 --> 33:37.040
- What is that?
- Nothing.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.896
An officer requesting
to go on a coffee break.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.513
Not having our satellites
is killing us.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.115
I mean, we can't scan the city
for dark matter.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.759
We don't have
facial recognition.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.036
All we would need to do
is see if there are any pockets

33:47.120 --> 33:48.976
of compressed air around
the city and we'd have her.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.879
You mean gauging atmospheric
pressure like a barometer?

33:51.960 --> 33:53.736
Yeah, but it would have
to be a big barometer.

33:53.760 --> 33:57.436
You mean like channel 52's
Doppler radar relay?

33:57.520 --> 34:00.399
Yeah, I mean, Vanessa's
blocks are constructed

34:00.480 --> 34:02.756
of highly dense air, so they'd
have the same composition

34:02.840 --> 34:04.354
as an extreme
atmospheric system.

34:04.440 --> 34:07.035
So, we track the weather
and we find her.

34:07.120 --> 34:08.952
- That's so schway.
- Okay, yeah.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.600
Let's do it, yeah.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.993
Go Team West-Allen.
Yeah!

34:16.080 --> 34:19.232
Okay, look, there's a
high-density low-pressure zone

34:19.320 --> 34:21.835
in a six block radius
around Pacific and Davies.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.478
Okay, cool.
All right, let's go.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.710
Hey, maybe I should
just stay here.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.871
Or you could put some
of that training to good use.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.797
Last chance, Vanessa.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.559
To do what?

34:35.639 --> 34:36.994
Just give me the keys

34:37.080 --> 34:38.536
<i>so I can drive my weapons
out of here.</i>

34:38.560 --> 34:39.880
Come on.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.176
Just hand them over
nice and easy.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.272
Yeah, right.

34:45.360 --> 34:46.953
Light her up!

34:59.560 --> 35:01.472
You two.
I swear...

35:08.200 --> 35:09.998
She's getting tired.

35:14.120 --> 35:15.713
We got her.

35:15.840 --> 35:17.115
Yeah, we did.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.473
- Gotcha.
- Uh-oh.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.714
- "Uh-oh"?
<i>- Flash is trapped!</i>

35:27.800 --> 35:29.000
What's wrong?
What's happening?

35:29.080 --> 35:30.992
Barry's in trouble.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.440
She gets tired.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.592
Hey, blockhead!
Try that on me!

36:11.160 --> 36:14.312
Bit off more
than you could chew, huh?

36:25.600 --> 36:28.718
Well,
my work here is done.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.110
Looks like she's a regular
chip off the ol' block.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.236
- Am I...
- Don't.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.470
Okay, yeah, I know.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.077
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.675
Get her to a hospital.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.878
XS! Now!

37:02.560 --> 37:03.994
Barry?
What is it?

37:04.080 --> 37:05.514
<i>- Who's there?</i>
- I don't know yet.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.589
I just lost my speed.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.672
- I got nothing.
- Negative, Ghost Rider.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.996
Guys, I know we're
three against one, but

37:23.080 --> 37:25.470
something tells me this guy's
got the advantage.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.110
Barry!

38:17.920 --> 38:21.277
What is that sound?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.551
Oh, my God.
Barry!

38:23.640 --> 38:25.416
<i>Barry, you've gotta get out
of there right now!</i>

38:29.840 --> 38:30.910
Dad!

38:44.520 --> 38:47.194
Dad.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.875
- Dad, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.799
I mean, this is
definitely dark matter,

39:07.880 --> 39:10.236
but these levels
of concentration are unlike

39:10.320 --> 39:12.710
any dark matter levels
I've ever seen before.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.896
Yeah, well, that wasn't quite
like any ass kicking

39:14.920 --> 39:17.151
I've ever gotten before either.

39:17.240 --> 39:18.310
That dagger he had,

39:18.400 --> 39:20.676
I think that
negated our powers.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.798
And he control it too,
like Mjolnir.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.555
That's Thor's hammer.

39:25.640 --> 39:27.313
I'm just glad
you guys are okay.

39:27.400 --> 39:28.675
This could've been a lot worse.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.029
Yeah.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.839
Careful.
Those cuts are pretty deep.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.196
It could take a while
for them to heal.

39:36.640 --> 39:40.077
Cisco,
that's not important right now.

39:48.440 --> 39:52.320
Look, if you wanna know,
this is your chance.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.718
I support you
either way, Caitlin.

40:23.960 --> 40:26.680
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.390
Caitlin,
did you see something?

40:31.480 --> 40:33.870
Yeah, I did.

40:36.720 --> 40:38.598
My mother.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.034
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

40:41.680 --> 40:43.512
Let's go.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.957
Hey, we got a big problem.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.350
So I talked to Captain Singh
and he said that Gridlock

40:56.440 --> 40:58.636
was killed during his transport
to Iron Heights.

40:58.720 --> 41:01.280
- Gridlock's dead?
- How?

41:01.360 --> 41:02.635
I'm not sure.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.016
I interviewed everyone
that was there

41:04.040 --> 41:05.040
and no one knows.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.520
But I did some digging...

41:07.720 --> 41:09.393
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

41:09.480 --> 41:10.896
<i>Stay where you are!
Freeze! Don't move!</i>

41:14.720 --> 41:16.598
Okay, so what are we
looking for here?

41:16.680 --> 41:19.400
Not looking.
Listening.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.993
It sounds like the guy
who just attacked us.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.311
Sounds like an insect.

41:29.400 --> 41:30.550
Yeah, it does.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.393
- Like a...
- Like a cicada.

41:38.160 --> 41:40.072
Who's Cicada?

42:10.280 --> 42:11.680
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
