the old Burmese capital Rangoon,

'where, having bought
three ancient lorries...'

00:12.022 --> 00:14.822

bridge over the River Kwai that was

00:17.852 --> 00:19.851
'strong enough to support them.'

00:19.852 --> 00:22.851
How big a bridge are we going to have
to build to support my truck?

00:22.852 --> 00:24.851
How much does yours weigh?
About 1,000 tonnes.

00:24.852 --> 00:29.851
'Getting to the river in Thailand
meant a 1,200 mile journey

00:29.852 --> 00:32.851

were dangerous...'

00:32.852 --> 00:35.851
Whoa.

00:35.852 --> 00:37.851
'..mountainous...'

00:37.852 --> 00:39.852
Ahhhhh!

00:40.097 --> 00:42.096
'..and often not roads at all.'

00:42.097 --> 00:45.096
Watch the wheel spin.
Sliding badly.

00:45.097 --> 00:50.096
'Since the producers insisted
we stay in Burmese truck stops...'

00:50.097 --> 00:52.097
Oh, it's not so bad.

00:54.097 --> 00:57.096
'..we turned our lorries
into houses.'

00:57.097 --> 01:00.097

have turned out to be improvements.

we ran out of fuel,

01:07.097 --> 01:09.096

and injured his arm.'

forced us to take drastic action.'

'Far ahead of Hammond's
disintegrating lorry,

02:24.236 --> 02:28.235
'James and I were about to enter a
secretive region of Burma known as

02:28.236 --> 02:30.235
'the Shan state.

'A civil war has raged
here for 60 years.

'No television crew has ever been
allowed in. We would be the first.'

02:41.236 --> 02:44.235
There is a very good reason
why it's so secretive in there.

02:44.236 --> 02:47.235
You see, the travel companies
would have you believe that

02:47.236 --> 02:51.235
the Golden Triangle is,
well, it's a tourist attraction,

02:51.236 --> 02:54.236
at the point where Thailand, Burma
and Laos all meet.

02:56.236 --> 03:00.235
But the golden triangle
with the - how can I put this -

03:00.236 --> 03:05.236
the special agriculture -
that is in the Shan.

03:07.236 --> 03:11.235
Apparently, some of the special
agriculture is known as horse,

03:11.236 --> 03:16.235
they're obviously growing horses
somehow. I shall look for those.

03:16.236 --> 03:19.236
Fields of horses growing in them.

03:24.236 --> 03:27.235
Here we go. Warm and cordial
welcome, this is it. This is it.

03:27.236 --> 03:29.236
We are entering the Shan.

03:32.236 --> 03:35.236
We genuinely are representing
the Western world.

03:37.236 --> 03:39.236
Good job I'm wearing a tie.

03:41.236 --> 03:43.235
'Unfortunately,
as the roads started to climb,

03:43.236 --> 03:47.236
'James and I rather forgot
the significance of where we were.'

It's coming.

04:15.236 --> 04:19.236
No, no, no!
I'm trapped by the pick-up.

04:20.236 --> 04:22.236
Eat my dirt.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.236
Got the inside line.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.236
This is the best race in the world.

04:41.236 --> 04:44.235
I've blocked him, I blocked him.

04:44.236 --> 04:48.236
Shall we call a temporary truce
while we go through the town, yeah?

04:51.236 --> 04:53.235
When we get back,
if we're interviewed by MI6

04:53.236 --> 04:56.235
and they say,
"What was it like in the Shan?"

04:56.236 --> 04:59.235
We'll have to go, "I don't know,
we were racing lorries."

04:59.236 --> 05:03.235
I am embarrassed to be
the first Westerner in here

05:03.236 --> 05:06.236

a pink teddy bear on the front.

05:09.236 --> 05:13.235
'To make us look more dignified,
I put Rudyard in the cab,

05:13.236 --> 05:17.444

we set off into the unknown.'

05:21.236 --> 05:22.236
God above.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.235
I think I've accidentally
taken a short cut

05:26.236 --> 05:29.236
into the set of Game Of Thrones.

'Here, in a region that is bigger
than England and Wales put together,

That is gigantic.

James and I pulled over,

'..we tried to work out why
us three had been the first ones

06:19.236 --> 06:21.235
'allowed in here.'

06:21.236 --> 06:22.235
Think about it.

06:22.236 --> 06:27.235
If you were North Korea, and you
wanted to portray to your people

06:27.236 --> 06:32.235
how lumpen and useless the West was,
you'd invite us three, wouldn't you?

06:32.236 --> 06:34.235
Yeah.

06:34.236 --> 06:36.235
Because we'd wander about
and the North Koreans would go,

06:36.236 --> 06:39.235
"Why would we want to be Western?
Look at them. They're dreadful."

06:39.236 --> 06:41.235
You've got bird poo on
your shoulder. I have.

06:41.236 --> 06:44.235
So what the government is
essentially saying to these

06:44.236 --> 06:46.235
people is, why would you want to
live like they do in the West?

06:46.236 --> 06:49.235
Look at them. There's another
thing that we're doing.

06:49.236 --> 06:51.235
This is just an incidental service.

06:51.236 --> 06:54.235
They haven't seen many
Westerners here.

06:54.236 --> 06:57.235
We are at least showing...
They're not going to end up saying,

06:57.236 --> 07:00.235
"They all look the same to me,"
are they? With us three.

07:00.236 --> 07:04.235
That's just blatantly racist.

07:04.236 --> 07:08.235
No... Clearly. Yes, you are.
You are.

07:08.236 --> 07:10.235
You're assuming that they think
we all look the same

07:10.236 --> 07:12.235
because we think
they all look the same.

07:12.236 --> 07:14.235
Now you're making a leap,
I didn't...

07:14.236 --> 07:17.235
You're completing something
that I didn't put in.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.236
Yes, we are,
but it's quite good fun.

we moved on.'

Chaps, check out the driver of this
tuk-tuk. What's he done?

07:44.236 --> 07:47.236
I don't know what it was,
but he's done a lot of it.

07:48.236 --> 07:51.236
He's off his face. Oh, dear.

07:52.236 --> 07:54.236
Oh, Lord, I see what you mean.

07:57.236 --> 08:01.235
James, do you see any fields
where they are growing horses?

08:01.236 --> 08:05.236
No, I haven't seen a single
horse plantation yet.

08:07.236 --> 08:11.235
'What we did see, however,
was evidence of what is officially

08:11.236 --> 08:14.236
'the world's longest running
civil war.'

08:19.236 --> 08:21.236
This is a big army presence, here.

'James, however, seemed to have
less important things on his mind.'

08:32.236 --> 08:36.236
Time to try out my water
brake cooling system.

08:37.236 --> 08:40.236
I'm ready. A little switch.

08:44.236 --> 08:45.627
I think it works.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.235
Cock.

08:59.236 --> 09:02.236
My steering has just locked up.

09:04.236 --> 09:08.235
I'm not sure that's a good idea,
James, is it? Blocking the Army?

09:08.236 --> 09:14.236
'The problem was a big one.
The front axle had broken.'

09:17.236 --> 09:21.236
There's only one thing I can think
to play at a time like this.

09:27.236 --> 09:32.236
Well, off you go. Goodbye.
That's a bad one, isn't it? See you.

09:49.236 --> 09:53.235
Ow! BLEEP.

09:53.236 --> 09:56.235
'As Hammond and I travelled
deeper into the Shan,

09:56.236 --> 09:57.236
'the road became worse.'

10:00.236 --> 10:02.236
Argh!

10:06.236 --> 10:10.236
'And the reason why soon
became clear.'

10:14.236 --> 10:17.236
That was an actual baby there,
building the road.

10:23.236 --> 10:26.236
It's not a good policy, because
the road surface is dreadful.

10:28.236 --> 10:31.236
Babies are no good at
building roads, look.

10:37.236 --> 10:40.236
'Which were a problem for
Hammond's heavy lumber bus.'

10:44.236 --> 10:46.235
God, it's torture.

10:46.236 --> 10:50.236
I hate this, I hate this,
I hate this.

10:55.236 --> 11:01.236
Change gear...
No. Grind, grind, grind.

11:03.236 --> 11:05.235
And when we get to the end,

11:05.236 --> 11:09.236
we have to build a bridge
over the River Kwai.

'Eventually,
we had to rest our weary bones,

11:16.236 --> 11:19.236
'so we pulled over in
a remote settlement.'

11:21.236 --> 11:23.235
You know, in a village like this,

11:23.236 --> 11:28.235
it really is possible
they don't know the West exists.

11:28.236 --> 11:31.235
They will never have seen
faces like ours. No.

11:31.236 --> 11:34.235
I'm amazed they're not more amazed.

11:34.236 --> 11:38.235
I think it's a cultural thing,
it would be rude to show it. Yeah.

11:38.236 --> 11:40.235
It's sort of...

11:40.236 --> 11:43.236
Definitely the first white faces
they've ever seen.

'Many miles further back,

11:48.236 --> 11:52.235

dog's egg with a crane on the back.

'and we decided to make camp
in a small town.'

Look at that lot.
Communal, open-air natural bathing.

12:31.236 --> 12:33.236
Hello.

12:36.236 --> 12:38.235
We're in the middle of the Shan.

12:38.236 --> 12:41.235
We're supposed to be
frightened to death.

12:41.236 --> 12:43.236
It's not frightening though,
is it? It's lovely.

12:45.236 --> 12:48.236
'As we set up camp, the locals
seemed to be busy as well.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.236
'And Jeremy had found out why.'

12:55.236 --> 13:03.235
Hammond, May. Yes? What? It turns
out we've been invited to a party.

13:03.236 --> 13:06.235
Right. Where? Here, in the town.

13:06.236 --> 13:10.235
You know there's been
a civil war raging?

13:10.236 --> 13:13.235
All of the people who've been
fighting are coming together tonight

13:13.236 --> 13:16.235
to welcome us here
to the Shan state.

13:16.236 --> 13:19.235
You know the Good Friday Agreement
where they got Major,

13:19.236 --> 13:23.235
Gerry Adams and Paisley all in
one room and it was amazing?

13:23.236 --> 13:26.235
Well, apparently this
is as amazing as that in Burma.

13:26.236 --> 13:30.235
Who do they think we are?
I don't know.

13:30.236 --> 13:34.235
Probably Richard Dimbleby,
James McNulty and Jeremy Paxman.

13:34.236 --> 13:37.235
They're not familiar with Top Gear,
are they? Evidently not.

13:37.236 --> 13:40.235
The only thing I'm speculating on
is I don't think

13:40.236 --> 13:46.235
we should turn up looking like this.
No. I have no formal wear with me.

13:46.236 --> 13:48.236
Naked would be better than that.

use his shower,

Listen, help yourselves to a drink,
because I've had a thought.

14:34.236 --> 14:40.235
It's possible MI6 or the DEA or
some intelligence agency will want

14:40.236 --> 14:45.235
to talk to us when
we get back about here. Right.

14:45.236 --> 14:49.235
So, manners - polite, British,
representatives of the BBC,

14:49.236 --> 14:51.235

finding things out, just be...

to Hammond...'

14:57.236 --> 14:58.235
Don't get drunk.

15:08.236 --> 15:12.235
'Where we were offered
some local delicacies...'

15:12.236 --> 15:13.235
It's a caterpillar?

15:13.236 --> 15:16.235
That's right, that's right,
caterpillar. Caterpillar.

15:16.236 --> 15:18.235
Goodbye, caterpillar.

to Hammond's taste,

'he went off to find something
that was.'

Hello, hello. Hello, yes.
I can do that. Yes, I could do that.

15:34.236 --> 15:36.235
This is all right.

nothing else. Nothing, nothing.

and I'm acting cool,

16:42.236 --> 16:45.236
♪ Got a cheerleader here... ♪

17:12.236 --> 17:15.234
Well, one thing is for sure.

17:15.236 --> 17:19.234
There are absolutely no drugs
in this part of Burma. No, none.

17:19.236 --> 17:21.234
I talked to everybody and...

17:21.236 --> 17:26.234
I talked to people involved
in the sales and distribution

17:26.236 --> 17:30.235
of stationery, I talked to
farmers, Army people, Colonel Kurtz.

17:30.236 --> 17:36.235
I spoke to Colonel Kurtz,
he was in vegetables.

17:36.236 --> 17:40.236
we can say, "You're looking
in the wrong place."

17:42.236 --> 17:46.235
Have you seen...
Our colleague is not well.

17:46.236 --> 17:50.235
We've got a lot of time to kill this
morning before that is capable

17:50.236 --> 17:51.236
of driving a lorry.

17:58.236 --> 18:02.236
'Many, many hours later,
we were back on the road.'

18:06.236 --> 18:08.236
I think I punched a colonel.

18:10.236 --> 18:12.235
Or kissed him.

18:12.236 --> 18:17.235
Hammond? Yeah? What was
your whiskey called again?

18:17.236 --> 18:20.235
Hankie Banister.

18:20.236 --> 18:25.236
"Hankie Banister. Third-best
Whiskey in northern Burma."

18:28.236 --> 18:32.235
'Soon, though, the memories of our
summit at the end of Apocalypse Now

18:32.236 --> 18:37.236
'were eclipsed by the sheer beauty
of this untouched paradise.'

18:45.236 --> 18:50.235
I've never taken more landscape
photographs in my entire life.

18:50.236 --> 18:51.236
It's just...

18:53.236 --> 18:57.236
You've got to come here.
You have got to come and see this.

19:04.236 --> 19:07.235
'James would have enjoyed
the view, too,

19:07.236 --> 19:11.236
'but predictably he'd had yet
another breakdown.'

19:16.236 --> 19:25.235
Cock. The problem is - well,
I don't know what the problem is,

19:25.236 --> 19:28.235
on two, then it was definitely only
running on one cylinder, because it

19:28.236 --> 19:32.236
sounded like the sort of generator
people put on in the night.

19:33.236 --> 19:35.236
Ah, BLEEP.

19:36.236 --> 19:38.236
Non-BBC Two word.

19:40.236 --> 19:43.235
'Once I'd fixed the problem,
which was wonky fuel injectors,

19:43.236 --> 19:45.236
'I was on the move again.'

19:47.236 --> 19:49.236
God, this lorry is appalling.

19:51.236 --> 19:53.235
'And it didn't take long
to catch the others,

19:53.236 --> 19:57.236
'because the road was steep,
and Hammond was in front.'

20:01.236 --> 20:04.236
First gear. Bad.

20:07.236 --> 20:09.236
Literally the slowest
I've ever been.

20:12.236 --> 20:14.235
Hammond, I haven't got
any more gears left.

20:14.236 --> 20:16.235
I can't get out the way,
the road's too narrow,

20:16.236 --> 20:19.236
I can't go any faster,
I'm in a lorry.

20:25.236 --> 20:27.236
It's pretty much vertical.

20:29.236 --> 20:35.236
God, look at the smoke now.
I've got a mining lung disease.

20:36.236 --> 20:40.236
I'm starting to imagine what Hammond
might look like without any skin on.

20:45.236 --> 20:46.236
Now what?

20:48.236 --> 20:51.236
I think if we all back up,
he can come in here.

20:53.236 --> 20:56.236
Hammond, we can't -
there's nothing to be gained by...

20:58.236 --> 21:01.236
Hammond, you idiot, you've
reversed into the sports lorry!

21:03.236 --> 21:07.236
You've broken it. I didn't know.
Genuinely, that was an accident.

21:08.236 --> 21:12.236
Don't just drive off, Hammond.
Hammond! Hammond!

21:14.236 --> 21:21.236
He's broken my headlights, radiator.
My bull bar is broken. The mirror.

21:22.236 --> 21:24.235
What, you just reverse and hope?

21:24.236 --> 21:27.235
Where did you think I was?!
All day, I have been behind you.

21:27.236 --> 21:30.235
I didn't think you were
that close behind me.

21:30.236 --> 21:33.235
I now know why they have those
stickers for lorry drivers -

21:33.236 --> 21:36.236
"If you can't see my mirrors,
I can't see you."

21:38.236 --> 21:42.235
'Even though the incident had been
technically my fault,

21:42.236 --> 21:44.236
'I still followed
the standard procedure.'

21:46.236 --> 21:49.236
What? He knows the rules.
Live by the sword, you must...

21:51.236 --> 21:54.236
I can't remember. Whatever.
Something to do with swords.

21:59.236 --> 22:03.235
Held me up all day,
then he reversed into me,

22:03.236 --> 22:07.236
so I think tonight Hammond's
other wrist might break.

22:11.236 --> 22:13.235
However, when I reached
the overnight holds,

22:13.236 --> 22:16.235
I came up with a more fiendish idea.

22:16.236 --> 22:19.235
An idea that involved the bucket
Hammond had fitted to collect

22:19.236 --> 22:21.236
rainwater for his shower.

22:25.236 --> 22:31.236
I think this does pay him back
for holding us up all day long. Yep.

22:33.236 --> 22:35.236
Oh, there's more. Part two.

22:38.236 --> 22:42.235
'I then began to work
on my lorry's waterworks.'

22:42.236 --> 22:47.236
Massive nuts holding the radiator
on. 22 millimetres. Yeah.

22:50.236 --> 22:54.236
Oh, it's warm.
So warm, fresh rainwater.

22:56.236 --> 23:01.236
Golden rain. I can taste
the goodness. The outdoors.

23:03.236 --> 23:06.236
And neither of you two
thought of this.

23:14.236 --> 23:16.235
'After dining on roast grasshopper,

23:16.236 --> 23:20.236
'we spent the evening playing
with my Chinese lanterns.'

23:21.236 --> 23:24.235
Are you going to set them off here?
Why not?

23:24.236 --> 23:28.235
I should say in a country where a lot
of people live in houses made of...

23:28.236 --> 23:32.235
What is it, dried grass? Oh, relax.
That's not going to be a problem.

23:32.236 --> 23:36.235
The chances of you getting one
of those things to work...

23:36.236 --> 23:38.236
There, let it fly.

23:39.236 --> 23:42.235
Yes. Hammond, ye of little faith.

23:42.236 --> 23:44.235
Go find a barn or a thatched roof.

23:44.236 --> 23:48.235
Now, let's just... I'm going to get
a beer and savour the moment.

23:48.236 --> 23:50.235
This is a... It's a mobile bonfire.
It is.

23:50.236 --> 23:53.235
If it were to land in a field
of poppies, for example,

23:53.236 --> 23:56.236
imagine how beautiful that would be.

23:58.236 --> 24:03.236
'Feeling content and happy, we
went to bed. Well, one of us did.'

24:06.236 --> 24:09.235
What do you think
the chances are of waking him?

24:09.236 --> 24:11.372
You won't wake him,
he sleeps the sleep of the dead.

24:14.236 --> 24:16.236
That's in neutral.

24:29.236 --> 24:30.236
Jesus Christ!

24:42.236 --> 24:46.236
'Jeremy hit the road
in a fractious mood.'

24:47.236 --> 24:49.236
Why did you tip me out of my lorry?

24:51.236 --> 24:54.235
Because you swung me
around in my tent.

24:54.236 --> 24:58.235
You deserved that because you're
irritating. I'm never irritating.

24:58.236 --> 25:02.235
It's a good point Jeremy raises,
I feel quite bad about it now,

25:02.236 --> 25:04.236
because when has he
ever been irritating?

25:06.236 --> 25:08.235
'To make my mood even worse,

25:08.236 --> 25:13.236
'the endless hard going had had
a catastrophic effect on my brakes.'

25:15.236 --> 25:18.235
I think they're only working
now on the left-hand side.

25:18.236 --> 25:21.235
Nothing, everything.

25:21.236 --> 25:23.276
You move your foot that much,
that's the difference.

25:25.236 --> 25:30.235
Fortunately, we were now only 80
miles from the border with Thailand.

25:30.236 --> 25:34.236
But, unfortunately,
none of those miles would be gentle.

25:41.236 --> 25:46.236
Oh, it's bad in here and it will be
worse in Jeremy's lorry.

25:55.236 --> 25:58.235
'It was desperately uncomfortable,
and hot,

25:58.236 --> 26:02.236
'and ahead of us lay
the biggest mountain range yet.'

26:18.236 --> 26:22.236
This climb is exactly what you need
in a lorry with a leaky radiator.

26:30.236 --> 26:35.236
Oh, that is a
trouser-threatening drop.

26:37.236 --> 26:40.236
James May is a man
who does not like heights.

26:41.236 --> 26:45.235
He is also a man whose lorry has
its front axle held on with

26:45.236 --> 26:46.236
a bit of string.

26:48.236 --> 26:51.235
How's your vertigo, May?
I'm not looking.

26:51.236 --> 26:54.236
But thanks for reminding me.

26:57.236 --> 27:00.235
'Progress was extremely slow

27:00.236 --> 27:02.236
'as I had to keep stopping to
refill my radiator.'

27:04.236 --> 27:07.236
Pouring out from exactly
where the araldite was.

27:10.236 --> 27:14.235
Fairly convinced this is an
old wives' tale, but we shall see.

27:14.236 --> 27:18.236
'Meanwhile, James was having
his first breakdown of the day.'

27:22.236 --> 27:23.236
Oh, BLEEP.

27:25.236 --> 27:27.236
Nope.

27:29.236 --> 27:32.235
'This time, it was the transfer box,

27:32.236 --> 27:35.235
'which had burst
free from its mountings.'

27:35.236 --> 27:39.235
That's the transfer box, that's
the bracket where it's bolted on,

27:39.236 --> 27:42.235
those two bolts have been
shaken out.

27:42.236 --> 27:43.236
Oh, cock.

27:50.236 --> 27:53.236
Still going on,
still more mountains.

27:55.236 --> 27:57.236
When will this end?

28:00.944 --> 28:02.235
Oh, my God, it gets steep.

28:02.236 --> 28:04.235
I've got to keep moving,

28:04.236 --> 28:10.235
if I stop, pulling away will
kill the clutch, I'm sure of that.

28:10.236 --> 28:14.235
OK, my temperature gauge is now
really very high.

28:14.236 --> 28:18.235
I'm looking for a little stream.

28:18.236 --> 28:22.235
'Still, at least the mood
was more cheerful than it

28:22.236 --> 28:24.236
'was at the back of the convoy.'

28:33.236 --> 28:35.235
BLEEP.

28:35.236 --> 28:39.236
BLEEPING second gear failed, and now
the engine has BLEEP BLEEP arse.

28:40.236 --> 28:43.236
You piece of BLEEP.

28:45.236 --> 28:50.235
'With some careful nursing,
Jeremy and I eventually reached

28:50.236 --> 28:55.236
'the summit, where there was
one hell of a reward.'

29:00.236 --> 29:01.236
That is insane.

29:16.236 --> 29:22.235
Never seen views like it. Not as
extensive. Not all at the same time.

29:22.236 --> 29:26.235
What have we got here?
Himalayas. Yeah. Austria.

29:26.236 --> 29:32.235
Bit of Scotland going on there. Quite
a bit of Scotland. And the sky.

29:32.236 --> 29:37.236
Enormous. Like a sky from Texas.
Texas sky. But bigger. Much bigger.

29:40.236 --> 29:43.236
Absolutely staggering.

29:45.236 --> 29:49.236
'Sadly, though, the piece
of the moment was then shattered.'

29:53.024 --> 29:54.641
The A-MAY van has arrived.

29:58.236 --> 30:00.236
He's in a rile.

30:03.236 --> 30:06.235
Mate, you've got the crane here.

30:06.236 --> 30:08.236
BLEEP! Heap of dog BLEEP!

30:10.236 --> 30:14.235
Don't say anything.
I don't think he's very happy.

30:14.236 --> 30:16.235
You know the old Buddhist
expression, don't you?

30:16.236 --> 30:20.236
He who tips a man out of his lorry
will suffer from many breakdowns.

30:23.236 --> 30:27.235
From here to the border
with Thailand it was downhill

30:27.236 --> 30:28.235
all the way.

30:28.236 --> 30:31.235
Which for me, at least,
was a bit alarming.

30:31.236 --> 30:33.236
Oh, God. Look at that road now.

30:35.236 --> 30:37.236
No brakes, no brakes.

30:41.235 --> 30:43.235
If your brakes went entirely
would you stay with it

30:43.236 --> 30:47.235
and hope you could sort it out
or would you bail out?

30:47.236 --> 30:50.236
I'm actually sitting here
planning that very thing.

30:52.236 --> 30:54.235
I've planned my bailout already.

30:54.236 --> 30:58.235
I've even practised
lunging for the door handle.

30:58.236 --> 31:01.235
I've got an image of James
punching his lorry all

31:01.236 --> 31:03.236
the way down the slopes as they fell.

31:13.236 --> 31:18.235
Amazingly, we all made it to the
bottom of the mountain in one piece.

31:18.236 --> 31:20.236
Nearly.

31:22.236 --> 31:25.236
And now we were
only 40 miles from the Thai border.

31:29.236 --> 31:32.236
Oh, this is it.
We are about to leave Burma.

31:35.236 --> 31:37.236
I'm gonna miss it.

32:14.236 --> 32:17.235
Soon we cross the border
into Thailand and this meant

32:17.236 --> 32:23.235
we were now just 90 miles from our
finishing line at the River Kwai.

32:23.236 --> 32:27.236
19 miles of easy-going
on smooth roads.

32:36.236 --> 32:40.235
Oh, it's hammered your tyre!
Your tyre is...

32:40.236 --> 32:43.236
It's detonating, mate.

32:45.236 --> 32:47.236
It's hard to explain to you...

32:51.236 --> 32:56.236
I'm not giving up. I'm not stopping.
How many wheels do I need?

33:00.236 --> 33:05.236
Happily, the rest of my tyres stayed
inflated and as darkness fell...

33:06.236 --> 33:09.236
..we finally reached our destination.

33:14.236 --> 33:17.235
I believe we are at the River Kwai.

33:17.236 --> 33:19.236
The crane is here, everybody.

33:21.236 --> 33:25.235
It's bolted onto a BLEEP lorry
but never mind that.

33:25.236 --> 33:27.236
My brain is frazzled.

33:32.236 --> 33:36.235
to the lorry struggling and screaming
and straining to climb another hill.

33:36.236 --> 33:38.236
Ah, ah, ah!

33:40.236 --> 33:43.236
I am going to sleep for 1,000 years.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.235
Has my spine come out
of the top of my head?

33:51.236 --> 33:54.235
I can't see because my eyes
have been shaken loose.

33:54.236 --> 33:57.235
I think my pelvis has
moved around in my body.

33:57.236 --> 34:00.235
I'm not surprised in your lorry.
It doesn't work.

34:00.236 --> 34:02.235
Your pedals are all different.

34:02.236 --> 34:05.235
Releasing the clutch is that.

34:05.236 --> 34:08.235
It's like a Masonic dance thing
that I have to do every time.

34:08.235 --> 34:11.235
You know those power plates in gyms
that make you stupid?

34:13.235 --> 34:15.235
There's also a psychological thing,

34:15.235 --> 34:18.235
every time I hear a diesel engine
start I have a nervous twitch.

34:18.235 --> 34:21.235
Manual gearboxes. What?

34:21.235 --> 34:24.235
You have ruined me and my life.

34:24.235 --> 34:26.235
The gearbox is too far...

34:28.235 --> 34:32.235
"The Prisoners Of War
walked to their bridge site,

34:32.235 --> 34:35.235
"you have driven here so shut up."

34:38.235 --> 34:42.235
"Work on the bridge starts at 0500."
What?!

34:43.235 --> 34:47.235
"0500 and you can't go home

34:47.235 --> 34:51.235
"until all three lorries
have driven over it."

34:51.235 --> 34:55.235
0500. What's the point?
We're not still in the war.

34:55.235 --> 34:58.236
What's the point of 0500?
It will only be a little river.

35:03.236 --> 35:07.235
The next morning at precisely 0500..
and 11,

35:07.236 --> 35:10.236
we discovered just how wrong
we were.

35:24.236 --> 35:28.235
It is much wider than I thought
it was going to be.

35:28.236 --> 35:34.236
I thought it would be a comedic
gully. I did. It's 100 times wider.

35:36.236 --> 35:42.235
We were going to need a 60m bridge
so James went off to make plans

35:42.236 --> 35:47.235
and Hammond and I decided to measure
the depth of the water.

35:47.236 --> 35:50.236
Well, when I say Hammond and I...

35:52.236 --> 35:54.235
I'm approaching plumb depth.

35:54.236 --> 35:58.236
Ah! Broach the plumb... Oh! Ah!

36:00.236 --> 36:02.235
It's ever so cold.

36:02.236 --> 36:03.235
I hate my job!

36:03.236 --> 36:06.235
In Bridge On The River Kwai
did Alec Guinness go,

36:06.236 --> 36:08.235
"Oh, it's ever so cold!"

36:08.236 --> 36:12.236
I bet he did in reality.
Oh! I bet he did in reality.

36:13.236 --> 36:18.235
Oh! Sadly, at this point my colleague
was carried away by the current.

36:18.236 --> 36:20.235
Swim, man!

36:20.236 --> 36:21.235
I am!

36:21.236 --> 36:24.235
You're the weakest swimmer
in the world.

36:24.236 --> 36:28.235
And since he was providing
no useful feedback,

36:28.236 --> 36:31.235
I went to check on James's plans.

36:31.236 --> 36:33.235
This is what I was thinking.

36:33.236 --> 36:36.235
The bank goes down at each
side obviously,

36:36.236 --> 36:39.235
we build up the approach area
with these baskets of stones,

36:39.236 --> 36:43.235
make vertical piles out of bamboo
like this, these longerons

36:43.236 --> 36:47.235
I'm calling them, they are bamboo
lashed together,

36:47.236 --> 36:48.235
these will go this way...

36:48.236 --> 36:51.235
Two tracks for the wheels,
the rest is immaterial

36:51.236 --> 36:54.235
and then a superstructure like this

36:54.236 --> 36:55.235
all adding strength.

36:55.236 --> 37:00.235
You know the sort of thing so
that it looks a bit like the film.

37:00.236 --> 37:03.235
Basically we need to start
with rocks

37:03.236 --> 37:05.235
and some wire mesh to make boxes
to put them in.

37:05.236 --> 37:07.235
Where are we getting rocks from?

37:07.236 --> 37:10.236
That's your job
because you have the tipper lorry.

37:11.236 --> 37:14.235
I set about making
the wire mesh baskets,

37:14.236 --> 37:18.236
freed up the space in Jeremy's
cargo bay...

37:20.236 --> 37:22.235
May, you imbecile!

37:22.236 --> 37:24.235
And when Hammond finally returned,

37:24.236 --> 37:28.236
I sent them both off to a nearby
quarry to get the rocks.

37:30.236 --> 37:34.235
You've put them in the front
of this one.

37:34.236 --> 37:36.235
Yeah, stick them in the front.

37:36.236 --> 37:39.236
Let's have these ones here.

37:40.236 --> 37:44.235
Jeremy...
Are you going to do anything?

37:44.236 --> 37:49.236
What can I do? Load the trucks.
He's loading them!

37:51.236 --> 37:55.235
With the trucks loaded,
Jeremy finally got off his backside

37:55.236 --> 37:58.235
and immediately started to shout
at me.

37:58.236 --> 38:01.235
Hammond! You idiot.

38:01.236 --> 38:03.235
What?

38:03.236 --> 38:07.236
You put about 400 tonnes of rocks
and it is stuck.

38:08.236 --> 38:13.235
I woke you to say are you going to
help with the loading?

38:13.236 --> 38:16.235
Your words were,
"There's nothing to do!"

38:16.236 --> 38:19.235
That's exactly the kind of issue
you should have been awake for.

38:19.236 --> 38:22.235
How do I know what your load is?
I don't know.

38:22.236 --> 38:25.236
The only solution was to tip
some of the rocks out.

38:28.236 --> 38:31.235
Oh, no, no, no!

38:31.236 --> 38:35.236
Oh, my. That's a remarkable accident.
Look...

38:37.236 --> 38:39.235
Oh, jeez, no.

38:39.236 --> 38:45.236
Your windscreen has come out.

38:47.236 --> 38:49.236
The breeze will be nice!

38:51.236 --> 38:56.236
Predictably, when we got back, James
was overflowing with sympathy.

39:04.236 --> 39:08.236
Did you head-butt it? But look...

39:13.236 --> 39:16.236
Richard and James began to load
their basket by hand.

39:17.236 --> 39:19.235
Oh, that's a big rock.

39:19.236 --> 39:23.236
But I'm allergic to manual labour
so I used horsepower instead.

39:28.236 --> 39:31.236
And then I went into town
to buy supper.

39:33.236 --> 39:35.236
Is this a marrow?

39:39.236 --> 39:42.235
A...? Name...

39:42.236 --> 39:46.236
This is... Crikey, is it?
I thought it was a marrow.

39:48.236 --> 39:52.235
That's something you learn. In
Thailand, the word for... Yes, that.

39:52.236 --> 39:54.236
That's the word for marrow.

39:56.236 --> 40:00.236
When I returned, I brought with me
a gang of local labourers.

40:01.236 --> 40:02.235
What are you doing?

40:02.236 --> 40:06.235
There's no way we're going to be
able to build this bridge
by ourselves, let's be reasonable.

40:06.236 --> 40:08.235
He's right, Hammond.

40:08.236 --> 40:12.235
You and I are not going to be able
to build this bridge by ourselves.

40:12.236 --> 40:15.235
I know.
Hello, officers won't work.

40:15.236 --> 40:18.235
Alec Guinness made that very
plain in Bridge On The River Kwai

40:18.236 --> 40:20.235
in the film.

40:20.236 --> 40:23.235
That was the whole premise of the
story is that officers won't work.

40:23.236 --> 40:29.235
You're an officer?
Of course I'm an officer.

40:29.236 --> 40:33.236
Because you've got a stick.
That stick may disappear quite soon.

40:36.236 --> 40:41.236
With the local chaps helping, James
and I started to make good progress.

41:01.236 --> 41:02.235
As we toiled away,

41:02.236 --> 41:08.236
the self-appointed officer seemed to
be setting up a children's tea party.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.235
What are you doing now?

41:13.236 --> 41:19.235
Well, it's a trick I learnt from
the British in Burma in the 19th century,

41:19.236 --> 41:24.235
they would employ some local young
chap, cover him in jam,

41:24.236 --> 41:27.235
he would follow them around all day
and he'd attract the insects.

41:27.236 --> 41:29.235
They called him a jam boy.

41:29.236 --> 41:32.235
This is my jam bear.
It doesn't seem very fair.

41:32.236 --> 41:37.236
It was, it was because at the end
of the day he got to keep the jam.

41:42.236 --> 41:48.235
At the end of our long difficult
day, I produced my delicious supper.

41:48.236 --> 41:51.235
It smells very good, Clarkson,
what is it?

41:51.236 --> 41:55.235
Mm, I'll whisper it to you because I
can't say it in front of the viewers.

41:55.236 --> 41:59.235
What? She just looked at me
and went...

41:59.236 --> 42:03.235
What did you say? Steady on!

42:03.236 --> 42:06.235
I'd even prepared a treat
for Hammond.

42:06.236 --> 42:09.236
For afters I've got you something
very special indeed. What?

42:10.534 --> 42:15.235
I know you're partial to
a bit of Black Cock. Oh, yes.

42:15.236 --> 42:18.235
And so I've managed to find...

42:18.236 --> 42:20.235
Oh, you hero.

42:20.236 --> 42:24.235
Oh, well done. Black Cock.
Stiff one? Yes, please.

42:24.236 --> 42:28.235
Get that down your neck.
Cheers.

42:28.236 --> 42:30.235
Bottoms up.

42:30.236 --> 42:34.235
I'll tell you what, I'm going
to sleep tonight. Absolutely.

42:34.236 --> 42:35.236
I am worn out.

42:39.236 --> 42:43.235
The next morning, the dawn light
reveals just how little

42:43.236 --> 42:44.236
we had achieved.

42:46.236 --> 42:51.236
So, before the morning mist had
cleared, everyone was hard at work.

42:52.236 --> 42:54.236
Well, when I say everyone...

43:16.236 --> 43:22.236
Morning, May. Good morning. Are you
actually going to do any work today?

43:23.236 --> 43:28.235
I have explained this to you
until I'm blue in the face.

43:28.236 --> 43:31.236
Officers won't work.

43:39.236 --> 43:40.236
Guys!

43:42.236 --> 43:44.235
May?

43:44.236 --> 43:46.236
Can you hear something?

43:47.236 --> 43:49.235
I need a poo!

43:49.236 --> 43:54.236
Guys, I've had a thought.
It turns out officers will work.

43:56.236 --> 44:01.235
After they released me...
Right, work. Remains available.

44:01.236 --> 44:06.235
I immediately decided we needed more
labour-saving machinery so I rented

44:06.236 --> 44:11.236
a digger for Hammond and I went for
something that would humiliate May.

44:21.236 --> 44:26.236
James has totally wasted his time
bringing that crane here.

44:29.236 --> 44:31.236
Go on, son!

44:32.236 --> 44:34.236
Oh, no!

44:42.236 --> 44:44.236
BLEEP! BLEEP!

44:46.236 --> 44:50.235
What was that? It fell over, James.
What have you done?

44:50.236 --> 44:53.235
Hold on a minute! Did you see
where the end of your jib landed?

44:53.236 --> 44:56.235
I had only walked back
to see where the pile was.

44:56.236 --> 45:00.235
If I'd still been standing there,
it would have taken my head off!
It fell over! It almost killed me!

45:00.236 --> 45:03.235
What do you mean, "It fell over"?
They don't fall over, crane lorries!

45:03.236 --> 45:05.235
They don't fall
over on the motorway!

45:05.236 --> 45:07.235
What do you mean,
it doesn't fall over?

45:07.236 --> 45:10.235
You knocked it over!
Your crane is too small,

45:10.236 --> 45:13.235
so, I've got a bigger one
to reach further into the river.

45:13.236 --> 45:16.236
Right. My crane is too small.
That's punishable by death, is it?

45:17.236 --> 45:22.235
After James had calmed down a bit,
we decided to solve the problem

45:22.236 --> 45:27.235
by using the combined power of
Richard's digger and the A-May Van.

45:27.236 --> 45:31.235
In three, two, one...

45:31.236 --> 45:33.236
Lift away!

45:47.236 --> 45:49.235
Oh!

45:49.236 --> 45:50.235
Yeah!

45:50.236 --> 45:55.236
But, with stronger cables, we soon
had my crane the right way up.

45:57.236 --> 45:59.236
Excellent. And back to work.

46:12.236 --> 46:14.236
Just use this as
an enormous hammer so...

46:22.236 --> 46:24.236
Just delicacy, this.

46:25.236 --> 46:27.235
Oi!

46:27.236 --> 46:30.235
That little insect that he's dragged
all the way here

46:30.236 --> 46:32.236
is simply getting in our way.

46:35.236 --> 46:36.236
Oh, well done, Hammond.

46:37.236 --> 46:38.236
Hang on.

46:40.236 --> 46:43.236
That's the ticket! Hammond!
Come on, James, out you come.

46:46.236 --> 46:48.235
Spiky things!

46:48.236 --> 46:51.235
Even though we were now
working as a team, and the bridge

46:51.236 --> 46:56.236
was starting to take shape, we were
still way behind James' schedule.

46:58.236 --> 47:02.235
This side, the blue pegs, represents
how far we should have got by now.

47:02.236 --> 47:05.235
The red pegs show how far
we actually have got.

47:05.236 --> 47:06.235
Obviously not far enough.

47:06.236 --> 47:08.236
It's worse than I thought.

47:10.236 --> 47:13.235
So, the three of us worked
on into the night.

47:13.236 --> 47:15.235
This long? This is long.

47:15.236 --> 47:17.235
That's to go to Hammond.

47:17.236 --> 47:20.235
Whoa, stop there. A bit further.
I've got it, I've got it.

47:20.236 --> 47:24.236
And even though we went to bed
exhausted...

47:25.236 --> 47:29.236
..Sleep for Jeremy and I was
impossible.

47:43.236 --> 47:45.236
Clarkson!

47:46.236 --> 47:47.236
Funny!

47:49.236 --> 47:50.236
You funny man!

47:51.236 --> 47:55.235
We were even funnier
getting him back in.

47:55.236 --> 47:58.235
I think it's the red one.
Is it the red one? I don't know.

47:58.236 --> 48:01.235
Right, so, hang on,
I've got one with, like, a circle.

48:01.236 --> 48:02.235
This one looks like an alien.

48:02.236 --> 48:04.236
That bottom one swivels. Jeez...

48:06.236 --> 48:08.235
No, the bottom one!

48:08.236 --> 48:09.236
Waargh!

48:12.236 --> 48:14.236
James, you're falling out your tent!

48:15.236 --> 48:17.235
He's fallen in!

48:17.236 --> 48:18.235
Help!

48:18.236 --> 48:21.236
That's an alarm clock, isn't it?!
Oh, sorry, James!

48:23.236 --> 48:26.235
The bottom of this river's
made out of turds. I know.

48:26.236 --> 48:28.236
Yeah.
Try not to drink more than a pint.

48:30.236 --> 48:33.235
As I was carried away
by the current, I noticed

48:33.236 --> 48:37.235
that the end of the bridge was
now beyond the reach of our cranes.

48:37.236 --> 48:40.236
So when I returned,
we built a home-made piledriver.

48:44.236 --> 48:47.235
Mounted it to a home-made barge...

48:47.236 --> 48:49.236
And kept right on going.

48:55.236 --> 48:57.236
Oh, no!

48:59.236 --> 49:00.236
BLEEP!

49:02.236 --> 49:04.235
Get it, stop it, stop it! James!

49:04.236 --> 49:06.235
I can't stop it!

49:06.236 --> 49:09.235
Get it, get it.

49:09.236 --> 49:10.235
Our bridge! Our bridge!

49:10.236 --> 49:11.236
Whoa!

49:13.236 --> 49:17.235
Quickly, go! Let's get it.

49:17.236 --> 49:18.235
Took hours!

49:18.236 --> 49:21.235
I've got it!

49:21.236 --> 49:22.236
Hold on!

49:24.236 --> 49:28.235
Oh, no! No! No!

49:28.236 --> 49:31.235
That was a deep bit!
I'm drowning in BLEEP!

49:31.236 --> 49:32.236
Oh, no!

49:34.236 --> 49:37.236
Man overboard!

49:38.236 --> 49:40.235
How the hell are we
ever going to...?

49:40.236 --> 49:42.235
This is worse!

49:42.236 --> 49:45.236
Abandon bridge! I'm getting back...
BLEEP!

49:46.236 --> 49:47.236
BLEEP!

49:50.236 --> 49:53.236
Once we were back ashore, we
gathered for an emergency meeting.

49:56.236 --> 49:59.235
I presume it was one of these
that gave way.

49:59.236 --> 50:02.235
The piling. But why did it?

50:02.236 --> 50:03.235
Come on.

50:03.236 --> 50:07.235
Would it help focus our minds
more on the problem

50:07.236 --> 50:10.235
if we had a shot of Hong Thong?

50:10.236 --> 50:13.235
Yes. Or we could have a Red Cock.

50:13.236 --> 50:15.235
We haven't had that.

50:15.236 --> 50:16.235
You got any white spirit?

50:16.236 --> 50:18.235
Yes, I have.

50:18.236 --> 50:21.235
I just don't get it.

50:21.236 --> 50:24.236
If one of the piers was wrong,
that would do it.

50:27.236 --> 50:33.235
If we used... What if we used more of
those whatever you call them,

50:33.236 --> 50:35.236
those bags of...

50:38.236 --> 50:43.235
I'm not helping him cough. What if
we use more of those bags of stones

50:43.236 --> 50:48.235
to protect the bamboo
pillars from the current?

50:48.236 --> 50:52.235
That White Spirit, by the way,
actually IS white spirit!

50:52.236 --> 50:54.236
You're kidding?! What?
It's for cleaning brushes.

50:59.236 --> 51:02.235
'We carried on with the build
and as the long, hot days passed,

51:02.236 --> 51:06.235
'the bridge inched closer to the
opposite bank.'

51:06.236 --> 51:09.236
There you go.

51:13.236 --> 51:15.236
Oh! He's gone through the ramp.

51:17.236 --> 51:19.235
Who here would like
an ice cold beer?

51:19.236 --> 51:23.236
Oh, yes, please.

51:30.236 --> 51:33.235
'But, as we passed the two
thirds point,

51:33.236 --> 51:37.236
'I was forced to call another
emergency meeting.'

51:39.236 --> 51:41.235
What's the matter?

51:41.236 --> 51:44.235
Well, you know, we thought
we were building a bridge over

51:44.236 --> 51:46.235
the River Kwai, which is noble?

51:46.236 --> 51:48.235
We are. We're not.

51:48.236 --> 51:50.236
The name of THAT river...

51:56.236 --> 51:57.236
The Kok?

51:58.236 --> 52:02.236
Top Gear is building a bridge
over the River Kok.

52:06.236 --> 52:08.235
It's actually memorable.

52:08.236 --> 52:12.235
It is, you wouldn't order the wrong
film from an Internet website.

52:12.236 --> 52:14.235
You'd be very careful if you
were. How is BBC presentation...

52:14.236 --> 52:17.235
You know the woman at the beginning
of every programme.

52:17.236 --> 52:20.235
"And tonight, Jeremy, James
and Richard build a bridge

52:20.236 --> 52:21.236
"over the River Kok"...

52:23.236 --> 52:25.236
Well, we're not moving it!

52:28.236 --> 52:31.235
'At this point we had been
at the site

52:31.236 --> 52:33.235
'for what seemed like an eternity

52:33.236 --> 52:35.235
'and we were desperate to get home

52:35.236 --> 52:38.235
'so we were working
round the clock.'

52:38.236 --> 52:40.235
Got it? Yeah. That's a heavy...

52:40.236 --> 52:42.236
That's a bit denser, that one.

52:45.236 --> 52:46.235
I hate bamboo.

52:46.236 --> 52:47.235
I hate bamboo.

52:47.236 --> 52:49.236
So much.

52:59.236 --> 53:00.235
You know,

53:00.236 --> 53:03.235
after that drive through Burma,

53:03.236 --> 53:05.235
I was left with

53:05.236 --> 53:09.235
an enormous amount of respect
for long-distance lorry drivers.

53:09.236 --> 53:10.235
But...

53:10.236 --> 53:12.235
Here, now,

53:12.236 --> 53:15.235
I have even more respect for those
prisoners of war...

53:15.236 --> 53:17.235
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

53:17.236 --> 53:20.235
I mean, let's be honest,
shall we,

53:20.236 --> 53:22.235
we are eat eating here at night.
Yeah.

53:22.236 --> 53:26.235
We haven't got dysentery
and we haven't got cholera. No.

53:26.236 --> 53:29.235
And we're not been beaten, daily.
No, no.

53:29.236 --> 53:32.235
This is difficult, hard, hot work...

53:32.236 --> 53:36.235
But nothing... No... at all...

53:36.236 --> 53:39.235
You know that metal box. Yeah.

53:39.236 --> 53:43.235
There was a guy called
Captain Drauer

53:43.236 --> 53:47.235
who broke the camp commandant's
table.

53:47.236 --> 53:50.235
He was sentenced to life underground
and they buried him

53:50.236 --> 53:53.235
in one of those metal boxes with
a metal roof exposed to the sun

53:53.236 --> 53:57.235
and he was in there for 76 days.
Oh, God.

53:57.236 --> 54:01.235
He had a broken arm when they put
him in and when they got him out

54:01.236 --> 54:03.236
the rats had eaten most of one
of his feet.

54:05.236 --> 54:07.236
It just beggars belief.

54:25.236 --> 54:28.235
'As the sun rose on the 15th day,

54:28.236 --> 54:32.235
'after the hardest work any of us
had ever done,

54:32.236 --> 54:34.236
'the bridge was finished.'

54:45.236 --> 54:47.235
That is a proud moment.

54:47.236 --> 54:49.235
But...

54:49.236 --> 54:51.236
There's a slope on it.

54:53.236 --> 54:55.236
You're right.
It's definitely higher on that side.

54:59.236 --> 55:01.235
'We decided to ignore the slope

55:01.236 --> 55:04.235
'and move straight to the
opening ceremony.'

55:04.236 --> 55:07.235
In three, two, one...

55:07.236 --> 55:08.236
I declare...

55:09.236 --> 55:11.236
..the bridge open.

55:13.236 --> 55:15.235
What a moment.

55:15.236 --> 55:17.235
And James May,
you shall cross it first.

55:17.236 --> 55:19.235
Why am I crossing it first?

55:19.236 --> 55:22.235
Because I just said, "James May,
you shall cross it first".

55:22.236 --> 55:25.236
He did, he said that. I did, didn't I?
You did, you said that. Definitely.

55:30.236 --> 55:32.235
Right...

55:32.236 --> 55:34.235
Lucky elephant, lucky owl,

55:34.236 --> 55:36.236
Buddha, here we go.

55:50.236 --> 55:52.236
Oh, yeah.

55:53.236 --> 55:56.236
I on the bridge over the River Kok.

56:06.236 --> 56:09.235
This is genuinely the most nerve
wracking thing I've ever done.

56:09.236 --> 56:13.235
James, you are perilously...
Does he realise?

56:13.236 --> 56:15.235
He's a long way over to the right.

56:15.236 --> 56:17.235
Just keep calm,

56:17.236 --> 56:19.235
keep calm.

56:19.236 --> 56:22.236
Oh, my God! It's squirreling.

56:25.236 --> 56:27.236
Oh! They're bending.

56:29.236 --> 56:30.578
I'm more than halfway across.

56:35.236 --> 56:37.236
BLEEP

56:39.236 --> 56:41.235
All I've got to do is get down here.

56:41.236 --> 56:44.235
I just got to get down here.

56:44.236 --> 56:46.235
I've almost done it.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.236
Please...

56:54.236 --> 56:56.236
I'm over the River Kok
on our own bridge!

56:59.236 --> 57:01.235
Yee-ha!

57:01.236 --> 57:02.236
Come on!

57:04.236 --> 57:05.235
Can you go next?

57:05.236 --> 57:08.235
Yes, I will go next. Yes?

57:08.236 --> 57:11.236
Yes, because your lorry is a lot heavier
than my lorry and will weaken it.

57:13.236 --> 57:14.236
I didn't think of that.

57:20.236 --> 57:23.235
I have a policy here,
speed and power.

57:23.236 --> 57:26.235
Because, in my mind,

57:26.236 --> 57:27.236
speed makes you lighter.

57:30.236 --> 57:31.634
I'm approaching the bridge now.

57:33.236 --> 57:35.235
Here we go.

57:35.236 --> 57:40.235
Taking your first ever gear change
on the bridge over the River Kok

57:40.236 --> 57:41.236
and I bolst it up!

57:43.236 --> 57:46.236
Getting to close to the middle.

57:50.236 --> 57:52.236
Oh, the splintering noises.

57:55.236 --> 57:57.236
I'm weakening it for Hammond!

57:59.236 --> 58:02.236
Yes! Come on sports lorry!

58:04.236 --> 58:06.235
Yes!

58:06.236 --> 58:09.235
My sports lorry has broken its door

58:09.236 --> 58:14.235
but it is across and is bouncing to
celebrate the moment.

58:14.236 --> 58:17.236
Yes!

58:18.236 --> 58:23.236
'Now it was the turn of the heaviest
lorry of the lot.'

58:26.236 --> 58:28.236
Oh, dear God.

58:32.236 --> 58:34.235
This is a bridge that we built.

58:34.236 --> 58:38.235
I mean, obviously, I want him to
fall into the Kok.

58:38.236 --> 58:39.235
Yes...

58:39.236 --> 58:42.235
But, if he does, we can't go home.

58:42.236 --> 58:45.236
The challenge said all three
lorries doing it. I know.

58:46.236 --> 58:51.235
This struck is supposed
to weigh 7.5 tonnes.

58:51.236 --> 58:54.235
I don't know if that takes
into consideration

58:54.236 --> 58:56.235
all the extra bits on top!

58:56.236 --> 58:57.235
Oh, my God!

58:57.236 --> 58:59.236
Oh, oh!

59:03.236 --> 59:05.235
Oh!

59:05.236 --> 59:07.235
Oh, I can hear it crushing.

59:07.236 --> 59:09.236
I can feel it moving.

59:10.236 --> 59:12.235
Oh, no, what's happened?

59:12.236 --> 59:16.235
Oh, no!

59:16.236 --> 59:18.235
What have I done?

59:18.236 --> 59:21.235
It's going at this end, as well.

59:21.236 --> 59:24.235
It's losing structure!

59:24.236 --> 59:26.235
Oh!

59:26.236 --> 59:28.235
It's breaking apart!

59:28.236 --> 59:30.235
Oh!

59:30.236 --> 59:31.463
Don't rush to the end, Rich.

59:31.464 --> 59:33.235
Just go in your own...

59:33.236 --> 59:37.235
Oh!

59:37.236 --> 59:38.236
Just tiptoe.

59:40.236 --> 59:42.235
Just tread lightly.

59:42.236 --> 59:44.235
Just tiptoe your way across.

59:44.236 --> 59:47.235
That's it. That's it.

59:47.236 --> 59:48.235
Light thoughts.

59:48.236 --> 59:50.236
This way, this way.

59:56.236 --> 59:58.235
This way a bit. This way a bit.

59:58.236 --> 01:00:00.235
This way a bit.

01:00:00.236 --> 01:00:02.235
This way, this way,
you're going to fall off.

01:00:02.236 --> 01:00:04.236
You're going to fall in!

01:00:09.236 --> 01:00:10.236
Yeah!

01:00:12.236 --> 01:00:14.235
Wo-ha-ha!

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:16.235
Yes!

01:00:16.236 --> 01:00:18.235
Richard Hammond!

01:00:18.236 --> 01:00:20.235
I've never been
glad to see you alive before

01:00:20.236 --> 01:00:21.235
but I am now.

01:00:21.236 --> 01:00:23.235
You were so close.

01:00:23.236 --> 01:00:26.235
We did it. We did it.

01:00:26.236 --> 01:00:28.235
Ow! Sorry.

01:00:28.236 --> 01:00:29.236
Mate...

01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:35.235
Do you know how close you were to
falling into the middle at the end?

01:00:35.236 --> 01:00:37.235
Half a tyre.

01:00:37.236 --> 01:00:39.235
Half a tyre over the edge.

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:41.235
The fact is, though...

01:00:41.236 --> 01:00:43.235
All three of us have done it.

01:00:43.236 --> 01:00:46.235
With our trucks, over the river.

01:00:46.236 --> 01:00:47.235
Here we are.

01:00:47.236 --> 01:00:50.235
1,200 miles, built a bridge... Yeah.

01:00:50.236 --> 01:00:52.235
..drove all three lorries across it.
Yeah.

01:00:52.260 --> 01:01:42.357
