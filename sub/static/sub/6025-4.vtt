00:10.640 --> 00:12.005
Richie!

00:13.560 --> 00:15.608
- Right on time.
- Hey. You're the lawyer?

00:15.720 --> 00:17.688
Ron LaFlamme. Great to meet you.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.884
All right, homeboy. Pop a squat.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.405
Start autographing by the flags.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.130
Lot of paper to get through.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.090
So, what do you think?

00:33.160 --> 00:34.321
About?

00:35.280 --> 00:37.408
Jeannie. She's pretty hot, right?

00:37.800 --> 00:40.280
Oh, yeah. No, she's... She's very pretty.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.761
Yeah, she is.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.570
Oh, we're doing that. Okay.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.768
So yo, Peter tells me you're
popping your cherry with this.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.080
So let me just walk you through it.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.409
That stuff you're signing gives you
the convertible note for funding

00:52.480 --> 00:54.960
and establishes you and Peter Gregory

00:55.080 --> 00:59.130
as the board members of Pied Piper,
incorporated in the state of Delaware.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.243
Okay. Why Delaware?

01:01.360 --> 01:03.089
Rich, Rich.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.403
Lawyer, not lawyer. I got you.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.729
So, Peter Gregory, big fan of you.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.922
- Oh.
- He invited you to his toga party, right?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.889
That's a big deal. Flo Rida's playing.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.849
- You dig Flo Rida?
- Should be fun.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.729
- Yeah, I went to a lot...
- See this guitar?

01:20.160 --> 01:22.640
Sergey and Larry from Google signed it.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.889
Both of them. Right there.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.482
So, Pied Piper.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.843
You're one of Peter's
compression plays, huh?

01:34.040 --> 01:36.008
One of? How many does he have?

01:36.360 --> 01:37.850
Not too many. Like six or eight.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.048
Okay. Why are there so many?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.931
You know how sea turtles
have a shit-ton of babies

01:43.040 --> 01:45.441
because most of them die
on their way down to the water?

01:45.840 --> 01:48.923
Peter just wants to make sure
that his money makes it to the ocean.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.765
But it seems like you
got your shit together.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.689
A lot of these guys come in here

01:52.800 --> 01:54.529
and they can do all the engineering stuff

01:54.680 --> 01:56.648
but they get all hung up on technicalities.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.525
They can't just tell you
what their vision for the company is.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.690
Those guys are so fucked.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.760
It's like you need both halves
of the brain, right?

02:04.840 --> 02:08.447
The Jobs and the Wozniak.
The ying and the yang.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.087
Ch. I think it's "Yin".

02:11.480 --> 02:13.005
- "Yin"?
- Yeah.

02:13.360 --> 02:17.160
- Like "Yin and yan?"
- No. Like yin and yang.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.245
No. It's ying and yang, they're opposites.

02:20.520 --> 02:23.569
So, Pied Piper, drop it on me. What is it?

02:24.720 --> 02:26.688
Well, we started off as a music app.

02:26.760 --> 02:27.807
Yuck.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.290
Yeah. Gross.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.840
But we've pivoted since then.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.929
Uh-oh. To what?

02:36.000 --> 02:39.322
Well, our Weissman scores
are consistently high across all media,

02:39.400 --> 02:41.402
audio, video, meta-data.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.490
Actually, that's not true.
We've had some trouble encoding 3D video.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.965
I think it's because the pixels change...

02:46.040 --> 02:49.840
value differently than conventional...

03:06.720 --> 03:07.767
Just look at the flow diagram, dude.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.241
No, the filter bank
is part of the prediction loop.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.444
What are you talking about,
this is lossless compression.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.682
Oh, hey, Big Head, you were there.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.122
Why did Richard use a DCT filter bank?

03:20.600 --> 03:21.601
Oh...

03:23.240 --> 03:25.925
Not really sure.
Richard tried to explain some of this stuff

03:26.000 --> 03:27.365
but a lot of it I didn't really understand,

03:27.440 --> 03:29.442
so I'd kinda just nod and smile, you know?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.243
Can you at least help us figure out
this insane DFT spider web he's using?

03:38.480 --> 03:41.165
Dude, do you understand any of this?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.166
I eat the fish.

03:48.240 --> 03:49.924
I understand you eat the fish.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.845
But when you clean the fish

03:52.080 --> 03:55.050
you can't leave the fish head
and guts and shit in the sink.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.208
Because the whole house
smells like a bait station.

03:57.560 --> 04:01.121
So you gotta put it in the trash
and then take the trash out.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.001
Do you understand?

04:03.600 --> 04:05.523
Yes. I eat the fish.

04:05.880 --> 04:07.120
Motherfuck!

04:08.560 --> 04:11.928
Do you know how awkward it is to not be
able to describe your own company?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.764
Like, I built Pied Piper and you can see it

04:13.840 --> 04:15.888
but I can't really
describe to you what it is

04:15.960 --> 04:17.769
even though I kind of know where I'm going.

04:17.839 --> 04:21.003
You do realize we quit working
on our own apps to work for you, right?

04:21.079 --> 04:24.687
Shouldn't you more than
"Kind of know where you're going?"

04:24.800 --> 04:26.848
Because that's basically what the CEO does.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.321
I do. Sort of.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.445
Okay, it's like trying to tell
someone how to get somewhere,

04:32.560 --> 04:34.562
even though you don't really know
the exact address. Right?

04:34.680 --> 04:36.444
Like, how do you do that?
Because you can't just say

04:36.520 --> 04:37.601
"Go to 415 Elm Street,"

04:37.680 --> 04:39.045
because you don't even know
what that is. Right?

04:39.160 --> 04:40.446
So you have to say, you know,

04:40.520 --> 04:43.364
"Go straight down that big road
and take a right at the weird thing."

04:43.480 --> 04:44.720
But, you can't describe
what that weird thing is

04:44.800 --> 04:46.840
because you just know
it as a weird thing, you know,

04:47.000 --> 04:48.286
in your head. You always have.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.721
Is that weird thing in
your head an aneurysm?

04:51.240 --> 04:53.925
Richard, I'm just gonna recap for a second,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.528
you turned down 10 million dollars

04:56.600 --> 05:00.127
to be able to develop something that you,
as the head of the company,

05:00.200 --> 05:02.521
can't even describe to another human being?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.209
I say this only to motivate you.

05:06.880 --> 05:10.930
Okay, so I have been
instructed to remove you

05:11.080 --> 05:13.811
from the list of employees
assigned to the Nucleus project.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.687
You will no longer receive any
Nucleus related communications,

05:18.560 --> 05:21.484
file reports, or attend
any Nucleus meetings.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.526
Any questions?

05:24.520 --> 05:27.126
No. That's... That's pretty clear.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.641
Great.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.248
Am I being reassigned to something else?

05:31.640 --> 05:35.725
Not that I am aware of. At this time. No.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.165
Wait, so then am I being fired?

05:37.240 --> 05:39.971
Because I have a three year contract
and my stock options...

05:40.040 --> 05:43.123
Okay. Nobody is being fired. Okay?

05:43.360 --> 05:45.681
Look, a contract is a contract.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.401
You know. You've got a contract.
And I've got a contract.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.403
We all have contracts.

05:51.480 --> 05:55.371
And here at Hooli, contracts are honored.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.611
Yours and mine.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.204
Everybody's. So...

06:01.440 --> 06:02.885
Have I made that perfectly clear?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.963
Yeah, no. That's clear.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.801
But, when I come into work
tomorrow, what do I do?

06:12.720 --> 06:15.644
That is unclear. At this time.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.040
Should've worn more than
my underwear and a bed sheet.

06:27.560 --> 06:31.042
- Underwear? Pussy.
- Yeah. I'm with him.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.970
This is the type of evening
that requires free-balling.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.009
Oh. I'm gonna take my underwear off too.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.082
Richard! Hey, you made it!

06:42.160 --> 06:45.960
So Peter met with LaFlamme today
and signed the paperwork,

06:46.040 --> 06:49.010
which means Pied Piper
is officially launched.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.961
Why didn't you tell me about all the
other compression plays Peter was seeding?

06:53.000 --> 06:57.289
What? No... Because it's nothing
you need to worry about.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.920
Because none of those other
companies have your vision.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.005
- My vision?
- Exactly.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.368
Speaking of which,
Peter really wants you to come in on Friday

07:04.440 --> 07:05.851
to chat about big picture stuff.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.764
You know, lay out your vision
in broad strokes.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.763
Broad strokes for the vision of the...

07:09.920 --> 07:12.890
Well, Pied Piper is compression
and we all know that.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.891
So we don't need to talk about that,
but I could because I'm the CEO.

07:17.280 --> 07:20.090
Pied Piper takes the data and...

07:21.200 --> 07:22.531
Smaller... To smaller form.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.331
And, also, there's more.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.331
It compresses the data overall...

07:29.440 --> 07:31.522
Excuse me. See you Friday. Hi Tom.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.483
Richard, pace yourself, buddy.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.403
You know, I wish this was Roman times.
You know?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.090
Life was simpler back then.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.128
Simpler for you. I would have been a slave.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.886
There's still time.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.246
Cool costume. Where'd you get it?

08:00.120 --> 08:01.451
My bed.

08:01.520 --> 08:03.249
- You're funny!
- Oh.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.448
I'm Brooke and this is my friend Anastasia.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.721
Hi.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.569
- Hi.
- What's up, guys?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.490
So, how do you know Peter Gregory?

08:14.680 --> 08:15.886
Oh, through work.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.080
We're actresses.

08:18.920 --> 08:20.081
Cool.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.730
What type of actressing work?

08:21.800 --> 08:23.165
Oh, we're working right now.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.444
Our startup sources actors
to parties to liven things up

08:26.520 --> 08:29.729
and get into conversations with guests
and be interested in them.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.841
Oh, neat.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.001
So, who else is paid to be here?

08:36.080 --> 08:39.402
Pretty much anyone that's
over a seven is with us,

08:39.480 --> 08:41.528
and anyone that's under a three is a guest.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.206
It's a really fun job.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.284
- Plus, I get to work with my boyfriend.
- Yeah.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.200
Yo, yo, party people,
y'all ready to get crazy?

08:52.280 --> 08:53.850
Is that Flo Rida?

08:54.120 --> 08:55.167
No idea.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.005
Y'all ready to take this party
to a whole 'nother level?

08:58.920 --> 09:01.446
It's time to meet the original O.G.
gangster,

09:01.640 --> 09:02.880
cash money mobster.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.128
Y'all put your hands
together for my brother!

09:05.320 --> 09:10.645
The illest, the chillest, emperor of Rome,
big Pete Gregory!

09:18.400 --> 09:20.243
He is the illest and the chillest?

09:25.760 --> 09:28.001
Big Pete Gregory!

09:35.200 --> 09:36.884
Thank you, Florida.

09:37.720 --> 09:41.122
Welcome to the Peter Gregory Foundation's

09:41.200 --> 09:43.680
fourth annual orgy of caring.

09:44.320 --> 09:47.130
The first three were fine.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.529
I hope that you enjoy the party.

09:52.360 --> 09:56.126
There is a second bar in back

09:56.840 --> 09:59.002
where the line is much shorter.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.602
Thank you. I'm finished now.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.650
That was very abrupt.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.683
- So this is a rap concert?
- Yep.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.810
Holy shit, look at Erlich!

10:23.360 --> 10:24.885
How the fuck did he get up there?

10:27.720 --> 10:29.688
Man. See, that's what I wish I had.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.524
It's like, I don't have any...

10:31.720 --> 10:34.644
- Game.
- Game, yes! That's it.

10:34.920 --> 10:36.490
You know, I always knew
I was missing something

10:36.560 --> 10:39.131
and then someone explained
to me the concept of game,

10:39.240 --> 10:44.280
I remember very distinctly thinking,
"That's what I don't have. Game."

10:47.080 --> 10:48.286
Sorry.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.764
- Hello?
- What's up, Richie Rich?

11:08.840 --> 11:10.604
Great seeing you last night, buddy.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.808
Just wanted you to know I had my associate

11:12.880 --> 11:16.248
draft up everything like we talked about
and it is all good.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.285
Just emailed you the board consent
which appoints your new board member.

11:19.400 --> 11:23.689
So just print it, sign it,
get it to Gregory to sign and it is donezo.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.610
New board member, what?

11:26.680 --> 11:28.444
It's in the PDF, you'll see.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.205
All right, homey, I gotta go.
My enema guy is here.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.562
<i>Gary! Namaste!</i>

11:36.720 --> 11:39.530
Pied Piper Incorporated
amended board of directors,

11:40.120 --> 11:44.284
Richard Hendricks, Peter Gregory,
Erlich Bachman?

11:45.240 --> 11:46.366
Oh, my God.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.563
Ls Sleeping Beauty awake yet?

11:50.640 --> 11:52.051
Yes, she is.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.486
Oh, boy. Here, I brought you something
for your stomach.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.322
Be forewarned,
the orange juice has vodka in it.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.404
Little hair of the dog.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.728
What exactly happened last night,
from your side?

12:06.800 --> 12:09.326
We happened, Richard. And the best part is,

12:09.480 --> 12:11.005
we can relive it whenever we want to.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.840
<i>We're two halves of the same brain!</i>

12:18.000 --> 12:19.411
<i>You complete me!</i>

12:19.480 --> 12:21.847
<i>Don't ever say that again!
Do you understand me?</i>

12:22.360 --> 12:24.010
<i>I will beat the shit out of you.</i>

12:24.200 --> 12:25.440
<i>Yo, yo, get that camera out my face.</i>

12:25.520 --> 12:27.409
<i>Come on, Mr. Rida. Okay. Okay.</i>

12:27.840 --> 12:31.242
- Look <i>at this</i> part.
<i>- I'm asking this fat, beautiful man...</i>

12:31.320 --> 12:34.483
<i>...in front of God and the Flo Rider</i>

12:34.560 --> 12:37.484
<i>and this white, weird cocaine statue</i>

12:38.520 --> 12:41.524
<i>to be on the Pied Piper board of directors.</i>

12:41.680 --> 12:44.843
<i>- Yes! A thousand times, yes!
- He's doin' it!</i>

12:45.960 --> 12:47.485
<i>- Shake on it.
- It's a deal.</i>

12:47.560 --> 12:48.686
Oh, no.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.526
Plus, we have this
for the Pied Piper documentary

12:51.600 --> 12:52.921
that we're eventually gonna make.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.731
We're making history together, partner.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.683
Are you dressed like Steve Jobs?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.011
Oh, am I?

13:03.400 --> 13:06.529
Well, I suppose Steve and I
always have shared a similar aesthetic.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.564
Hey.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.441
Little help?

13:27.080 --> 13:28.241
Oh. Okay.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.890
- Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.084
Sorry about the throw. Bursitis.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.521
Yeah.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.321
So, you guys having a meeting up here?

13:59.320 --> 14:00.560
No. Not exactly.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.724
We're all currently unassigned.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.127
How about you?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.651
- Yeah. Unassigned.
- Yeah.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.450
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

14:12.360 --> 14:14.800
How could you put Erlich on the board?
What were you thinking?

14:15.360 --> 14:17.886
You don't put someone inside
the company on the board.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.000
Then he and Peter Gregory can vote you out.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.403
Yeah. You gotta find an outsider you trust.
Like your mom.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.845
I'd put Erlich on the board before my mom.
Backstabbing bitch.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.520
Guys, I was drunk, okay?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.928
You know, I half-jokingly
said to Gilfoyle last night,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.161
"it looks like Richard
is going to suck Erlich's dick."

14:35.600 --> 14:37.409
But that would be reasonable
compared to this.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.640
Richard, could I speak to you?

14:41.760 --> 14:43.728
Okay. Yeah.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.727
He's the least cool guy I've ever met.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.650
I heard about what's been happening.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.288
I have to say, I'm a little disappointed.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.007
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know what I was thinking.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.970
Yes. I mean,

15:02.320 --> 15:05.244
is there a reason I wasn't
invited to the party?

15:05.560 --> 15:08.040
Is there some sense that
I'm not part of the gang?

15:08.320 --> 15:10.971
What? Jared.

15:11.280 --> 15:14.966
Of course not. it was just an oversight.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.202
I mean, we weren't even sure
if we were gonna go.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.364
And what was it like there?

15:20.800 --> 15:22.643
Were there gelatin shots?

15:23.480 --> 15:27.371
No. No, it was stupid and loud.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.920
Honestly, you're better off.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.367
I suppose. I had a fine night.

15:32.400 --> 15:36.530
I had some palak paneer
and I watched a documentary about Liberia.

15:36.800 --> 15:41.089
But then I woke up to this
unexpected development.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.561
Do you...
Do you really want Erlich on the board?

15:43.680 --> 15:47.082
- Because I'll support you...
- No. I don't. At all.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.203
I was drunk.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.561
I don't know how to get out of it.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.967
I mean, what am I going
to say to Peter Gregory?

15:54.880 --> 15:57.963
Well, if you don't sign the documents,
and you don't give them to Peter Gregory,

15:58.040 --> 15:59.769
then it won't happen. Simple as that.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.369
Really? I...

16:03.120 --> 16:04.201
Wow. Okay.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.448
That is a relief, Jared. Thanks.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.845
I'm glad you're around.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.246
Well, keep that in mind for future parties.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.801
Honestly, sometimes we forget you're here.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.565
You guys, company photo time
out back. Let's go!

16:23.120 --> 16:25.885
Gilfoyle, okay, off to
the center a little bit.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.644
Like your personality. No, no, no, no.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.207
Dinesh, leave it unbuttoned.
We want you to look like shit.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.050
Makes for a better "Before" photo.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.600
But you're wearing a jacket.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.084
Yeah, because I'm the genius marketer.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.804
I'm not a code freak like you guys.

16:37.960 --> 16:41.760
Besides, I'm wearing sandals
so I am iconoclasting a little bit.

16:42.120 --> 16:45.044
Oh, good. Jared.
What the fuck is with that vest?

16:45.240 --> 16:48.050
Right over here.
As if you're sort of a late addition

16:48.120 --> 16:51.488
that may not stick around
for the entire duration of the company.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.245
And then, Richard.
There you go. The man of the hour.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.647
Okay. We'll take a few like this,

16:57.400 --> 16:59.767
and then just Richard and I.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.451
Because at the end of the day,

17:01.920 --> 17:05.163
people only want to see a picture
of the board members.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.404
It... Actually, it's...

17:10.079 --> 17:11.684
You're not gonna be a board member.

17:12.119 --> 17:13.609
What?

17:15.560 --> 17:17.449
I'm in year three of a five year deal

17:17.520 --> 17:19.521
and, Matt, you got what,
like three years left?

17:19.920 --> 17:22.127
Yeah. We all got acquired by Hooli,

17:22.200 --> 17:25.010
when we didn't work out,
none of us got reassigned.

17:25.079 --> 17:29.529
Because Gavin believes in this
Japanese form of management

17:29.640 --> 17:32.928
where not being assigned
is the most shameful outcome.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.483
Yeah, it does feel uncomfortable.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.241
Give it a week or two,
you'll get, like, numb to it.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.961
Well, why are you guys still coming in?

17:42.240 --> 17:43.810
Rest and vest.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.407
Oh...

17:45.480 --> 17:47.721
Because in order to fully
vest your options,

17:47.800 --> 17:50.406
you've gotta wait until
your contracts are up.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.528
- I get it.
- You catch on slow.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.240
You'll fit right in here.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.285
Lunch? Arby's on El Camino? I'll drive.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.643
No, let's walk. It'll take longer.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.520
Gotta do something to fill the day, right?

18:01.720 --> 18:03.802
I was drunk! You took advantage of me!

18:03.880 --> 18:06.400
Man, they are really going at it.

18:06.600 --> 18:11.003
So, last night, what was
the girl situation?

18:12.040 --> 18:13.724
And after all I've given
up for this company.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.325
Oh, what have you given up?

18:15.560 --> 18:18.848
I owned 10% of Dinesh's app,
10% of Gilfoyle's app.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.208
Multiple potential streams of income.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.449
Not to mention that 100%
of the team that you have,

18:24.520 --> 18:26.682
were all guys that I
recruited for this house.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.088
- That must be worth something to me.
- It is.

18:29.240 --> 18:30.765
10% of Pied Piper!

18:30.880 --> 18:33.531
For which I forewent,
yes, that's a real word,

18:33.680 --> 18:35.569
one million dollars.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.521
I supported you, Richard. I bet on you.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.928
And now you're just gonna
give me a seat on the board,

18:41.000 --> 18:42.764
only to retract that offer?

18:42.840 --> 18:44.888
I can't even remember doing that!

18:45.000 --> 18:48.561
Oh, really? Well, do you remember
this particular dick-bag I got on video?

18:49.240 --> 18:50.366
Because you did.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.001
Put it away.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.646
It's right here.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.327
Goddammit.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.161
- I've seen the video.
- It's the wrong album, just give me a sec...

19:00.200 --> 19:01.201
You know what? Fuck it!

19:01.280 --> 19:03.726
You offering me a position on this board
and reneging it

19:03.880 --> 19:06.247
is a perfect example of
you having no vision,

19:06.400 --> 19:08.368
no balls and no game.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.280
Maybe he did blow him.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.010
Well, love and hate. It's all passion.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.129
And if that's the kind of
company you wanna run,

19:16.240 --> 19:17.287
well, then, fine.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.926
God help you. 'Cause I sure as hell ain't.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.925
What are you doing?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.365
You give your loyalty to somebody...

19:23.440 --> 19:24.720
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch!

19:25.080 --> 19:26.605
I can do it myself.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.961
All right.

19:31.080 --> 19:34.084
I just put it back on. Goddammit!

19:36.560 --> 19:37.766
Okay. Read that back to me.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.129
"Pied Piper's mission is to bring its unique
compression algorithm to a variety..."

19:41.280 --> 19:42.850
One thing you should know
about living in this house

19:42.920 --> 19:44.729
is I do not tolerate substance abuse.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.531
There's no drinking and
lying in this house.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.531
I should have made that more clear
to some of the current residents.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.927
Like this one. Don't mind him.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.844
He'll be gone soon
when his company cakes its pants.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.647
Hopefully, Jurgen, you'll be able to bring
a more positive element to the house.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.405
Let me show you the room I'm offering.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.164
Some of his stuff is still in there,

20:03.240 --> 20:05.447
but, as I mentioned, it will soon be gone.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.764
Once his company cakes its pants.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.649
It's okay. Just take a breath.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.524
It's fine. I'm fine. We just...

20:13.600 --> 20:15.841
Let's get through this.
Okay, so, read this back to me.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.801
- "Pied Piper's mission..."
- Hey, guys.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.962
Hope you don't mind,
the front door was just open.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.246
Hi, Big Head. What's up?

20:22.360 --> 20:26.331
Honestly? Nothing.
I've just been sitting around all day.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.041
Not working. It's weird, you know?

20:30.120 --> 20:31.167
Yeah.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.361
So, what's up with you guys?

20:36.440 --> 20:37.726
We're just sort of...

20:37.880 --> 20:40.167
We're getting ready for this big
Peter Gregory meeting.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.931
And we have a lot of work to do, so...

20:44.160 --> 20:46.845
Cool. Very cool.

20:49.280 --> 20:53.001
You know, Richard, the irony is that
if you had taken the ten million,

20:53.160 --> 20:55.242
you'd be kicking back
with a ton of money right now

20:55.320 --> 20:56.321
and I'd still be working.

20:56.440 --> 20:59.728
But you didn't, obviously.
And now I've got nothing to do,

20:59.800 --> 21:03.327
I'm rolling in it,
and you're working your ass off.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.841
Life's funny isn't it?

21:08.480 --> 21:10.005
You guys want to walk to Arby's,

21:10.120 --> 21:12.361
maybe grab a bite, play
a little hacky sack?

21:16.040 --> 21:18.964
Yeah. I should probably
get back to work, anyway.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.805
I mean, not work, exactly, I don't...

21:21.880 --> 21:24.770
I don't work.
But, you know, just get back to Hooli.

21:26.360 --> 21:29.170
Sit around all day and get paid
a bunch of money to do nothing.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.486
Weird.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.964
You ready?

21:36.040 --> 21:37.883
You know what you're going to say?
You want to run it by me?

21:37.960 --> 21:40.406
No, no. I got this. Fuck Erlich.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.120
You know, I turned down ten million dollars
to build this thing.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.810
You want vision,
I will show you fucking vision.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.247
I like this new angry side to you.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.763
Being around angry people relaxes me,
because I know where I stand.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.163
Oh, shoot. I think I got something
stuck in my teeth.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.084
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom,
check it out. I'll be back in a sec.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.761
Richard, it's Jared. Are you okay?

22:30.480 --> 22:34.724
Hey buddy, what's going on here?

22:35.400 --> 22:37.323
I thought I had something in my teeth,

22:37.600 --> 22:40.570
but when I looked over, right?
I looked in the mirror like this,

22:41.120 --> 22:42.565
my pants, they hit the counter top,

22:42.640 --> 22:44.529
and it must have some
water on there, right?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.721
So I got a spot on my pants, kinda looked
like I pissed myself like a big baby.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.729
So what I did was, I just
took off all my pants

22:49.880 --> 22:51.803
and I put it in the water
just to make it all completely wet.

22:51.960 --> 22:53.610
You know, that way I figured
no one would really notice.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.603
So, you know, it wouldn't be as bad.
I've got it under control.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.011
I've sorted it out. We're good.

22:57.480 --> 23:00.927
Yes. So you felt this wouldn't look as bad.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.171
- Understood.
- Yeah.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.449
But, Richard?

23:06.640 --> 23:10.406
Consider that maybe this might not be
the best choice for the meeting?

23:10.920 --> 23:13.571
Yeah. Holy...

23:14.120 --> 23:15.531
What the fuck am I doing?

23:16.160 --> 23:17.685
I can't go like this to the meeting.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.406
Jared. I have no vision.

23:20.640 --> 23:21.766
Yes, you do.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.481
- I believe in you...
- No, no, I literally have no vision.

23:25.560 --> 23:29.042
All I see is stars and swirls.
I cannot see right now.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.361
Okay, okay, let's get your pants on.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.330
Richard? Jared? Are you in there?

23:33.840 --> 23:34.841
Ohh.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.208
Hey, there's some weather over the ocean

23:39.320 --> 23:41.481
so Peter would love to get started.
Are you guys ready?

23:41.520 --> 23:43.522
Yep. All good. Be there in a jiffy.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.681
- Okay.
- Oh.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.282
Jared, I'm on a carpet in a bathroom.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.688
Yeah, okay.

23:50.960 --> 23:54.601
I know this isn't the best thing to say
to someone having a panic attack,

23:55.000 --> 23:56.650
but we need to hurry here.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.489
- Doing okay?
- Yes, much better.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.166
Nope. Worse.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.567
Richard, you're gonna listen to me
if you know what's good for you.

24:05.680 --> 24:06.680
Erlich.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.643
I may have been wrong
about being a board member

24:08.720 --> 24:11.963
and I may be wrong about being
the Steve Jobs in our relationship.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.811
But I do know this,
you are the Steve Wozniak.

24:14.960 --> 24:18.203
And no Woz should go into
a meeting like that alone.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.881
No. Actually...

24:19.960 --> 24:23.123
So if you'll just let me come in,
then I won't speak.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.441
And I just think you should
have somebody in there

24:25.680 --> 24:27.409
who will actually have your back.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.571
Okay. No, I... Erlich, I
want you to be in there.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.371
Okay... Wait, what?

24:33.480 --> 24:34.811
Yes, and I need you to do all the talking.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.480
Because I feel like if I do
I'm gonna puke all over Peter Gregory.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.722
Oh. Okay. Wow.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.282
That was easier than I... All the talking?

24:42.960 --> 24:44.689
Oh, Erlich, you're here too?

24:45.400 --> 24:46.765
Okay. Come on in, guys.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.005
I'm going to stay here, I think.
Because I look absurd.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.325
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.251
So what are you going to say?

24:55.760 --> 24:57.171
Fuck, I don't know.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.685
Today's user wants access
to all of their files

25:06.800 --> 25:09.121
from all their devices instantly.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.562
That's why cloud-based is the Holy Grail.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.444
Now Dropbox is winning,

25:13.840 --> 25:15.808
but when it comes to audio and video files,

25:15.920 --> 25:18.161
they might as well be called Dripbox.

25:20.320 --> 25:25.611
Using our platform, Pied Piper users would
be able to compress all of their files

25:25.960 --> 25:29.567
to the point where they truly
can access them instantly.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.521
We control the pipe,

25:32.440 --> 25:33.521
they just use it.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.681
That's the vision in
Richard Hendricks' head.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.121
Sure.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.480
Sounds fine.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.367
Oh.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.887
I received an email from Ron LaFlamme

25:56.200 --> 25:59.090
saying that this gentleman

25:59.520 --> 26:01.602
is going to be our third board member?

26:06.040 --> 26:08.122
Yes. Yes.

26:09.040 --> 26:11.520
Erlich helped me with all this stuff.
He's very talented.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.285
I need him as a partner.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.566
Fine.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.082
It's okay for you to leave now.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.560
All right, okay.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.849
Wait, is that you and Gavin Belson?

26:37.640 --> 26:40.689
Yes. It's an old photograph.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.687
Were you guys friends?

26:43.160 --> 26:44.366
I thought so.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.366
Good-bye.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.241
How'd it go?

26:52.320 --> 26:53.560
That was amazing.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.166
I mean, that was like everything
in my head, but, like, clear.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.840
Did you just make that up on the spot?

26:58.200 --> 27:01.124
Yeah. We should probably
write some of it down.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.124
Yeah. Well, look. I gotta be honest,

27:04.240 --> 27:06.766
I mean, I can't tell you
how much this means.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.247
You really saved my ass
even after I was such a dick to you.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.727
- You're making up!
- What else could I do, Richard?

27:11.920 --> 27:13.251
You're my Wozniak.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.085
And I will always be...

27:19.600 --> 27:20.647
Motherfu...
