[narrator] <i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:10.010 --> 00:13.555
The first time any of us heard
of Gryphons and Gargoyles

00:13.638 --> 00:14.723
was from your mother.

00:14.806 --> 00:17.100
[Betty] Ben and Dilton kill themselves,

00:17.350 --> 00:20.395
all to appease some creature
called the Gargoyle King.

00:20.687 --> 00:24.733
Toxicology report revealed lethal levels
of cyanide in Mr. Doiley's blood.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.735
There's something familiar about this.

00:26.818 --> 00:27.819
We made a vow.

00:27.902 --> 00:31.865
-The secret we buried all those years ago.
-Made a pact to never revisit that.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.993
-[Jughead] Do you have a player's manual?
-Flip for your fate.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.203
-Promise to give me the scripture?
-Promise.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.039
-Salut.
-[FP] You been playing the game?

00:39.122 --> 00:40.707
-No.
-Don't lie to me, boy.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.250
I see the blue on your lips.

00:42.333 --> 00:45.795
[Jughead] No one will play, but that book
may be our best shot at figuring out

00:45.879 --> 00:49.007
-what happened to Dilton and Ben.
-[Hermione] Our children are in danger.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.425
-Where'd you get this?
-My locker.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.093
Same with everyone else.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.681
[Jughead] <i>A deadly mutating virus</i>
<i>had been introduced</i>

00:56.765 --> 00:58.266
<i>to the ecosystem of Riverdale,</i>

00:58.767 --> 01:00.685
<i>and it was spreading like an epidemic.</i>

01:01.352 --> 01:04.773
<i>For every manual confiscated,</i>
<i>two popped up in its place.</i>

01:04.981 --> 01:07.484
<i>And the ever-resourceful students</i>
<i>of Riverdale High</i>

01:07.859 --> 01:09.652
<i>were playing it everywhere.</i>

01:10.487 --> 01:13.156
<i>Why? Because for us,</i>
<i>the game was an escape</i>

01:13.239 --> 01:17.368
<i>from our nightmarish reality,</i>
<i>a fantasyland at our fingertips.</i>

01:17.952 --> 01:20.663
<i>But for our parents,</i>
<i>it was a death-dealing nightmare.</i>

01:20.747 --> 01:23.124
Two students have taken their lives.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.753
A third tried.
The common thread linking these tragedies:

01:26.836 --> 01:31.049
all three victims were playing the game
known as Gryphons and Gargoyles.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.260
You're admitting
the game killed Dilton and Ben?

01:34.719 --> 01:35.720
Yes, Mr. Jones.

01:35.970 --> 01:39.474
But where did G&amp;G come from?
Where did Ben and Dilton even get it?

01:39.557 --> 01:41.351
We still don't have many answers,

01:41.434 --> 01:45.396
but from the little that we know about it
the game seems targeted

01:45.480 --> 01:47.273
at impressionable developing minds.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.067
Namely, teens like yourselves.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.402
Um... Challenge accepted.

01:51.694 --> 01:52.695
Respect to the dead,

01:52.779 --> 01:56.157
but some among our flock are shepherds,
not sheep.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.743
The game's quests
and role-playing scenarios

01:58.827 --> 02:00.370
are specifically designed

02:00.453 --> 02:03.957
to foster delusion, paranoia,
and ultimately violence.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.252
As mayor, I'm officially banning
Gryphons and Gargoyles.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.964
Mrs. Burble is gonna be holding
extended office hours,

02:11.047 --> 02:14.175
and I've set up a 24-hour crisis hotline,

02:14.884 --> 02:16.136
overseen by Kevin Keller.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.929
FYI, I am only there after school.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.515
As a parent, I'm imploring you.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.226
Take care of yourselves. And stay away from this game.

02:28.773 --> 02:30.483
[Veronica] Newsflash, Mom,
banning something

02:30.567 --> 02:32.235
only makes it more interesting.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.319
Thank you.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.823
And now this stupid game
is literally all anyone is talking about.

-Are you and Jughead playing?
-No.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.129
We're trying to find out why my mom
and his dad were so triggered

02:51.212 --> 02:52.589
by us having the manuals.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.965

02:55.133 --> 02:57.802
-Hello?
-<i>Ms. Cooper, this is Dr. Curdle Junior.</i>

02:57.886 --> 02:58.887
<i>Are you alone?</i>

03:02.348 --> 03:03.600
Hi, Dr. Curdle.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.144
Yes. Have you had any luck?

03:06.227 --> 03:09.230
<i>Per your request,</i>
<i>I did some digging in the morgue archives.</i> <i>I found something</i>
<i>I think you'll be interested in.</i>

03:13.776 --> 03:16.404
Dr. Curdle Junior told me and Jughead

03:16.487 --> 03:18.907
that the circumstances
of Dilton Doiley's suicide

03:18.990 --> 03:20.867
felt oddly familiar to him.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.370
That file is why.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.873
A case from when his dad was coroner.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.209
I am right in the middle
of my affirmations.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.169
Trust me, you'll wanna look at this.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.640
Per your Farm "testimony,"

03:43.723 --> 03:45.850
you've clearly played G&amp;G before.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.937
Now I have concrete evidence
that when you were my age

03:49.020 --> 03:52.690
there was another suspicious death,
maybe a murder,

03:52.941 --> 03:56.861
that took place at Riverdale High
where the corpse had blue lips.

03:58.279 --> 04:03.117
I can keep digging or you can just tell me
what you know about G&amp;G.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.494
All right.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.496
Wait, really?

04:10.208 --> 04:13.044
You're right, Betty.
You deserve to know the whole truth.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.840
If for no other reason,
for your own protection.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.302
