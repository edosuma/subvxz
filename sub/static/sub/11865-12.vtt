01:11.189 --> 01:14.110
When I was little, my father,
who was an english teacher,

01:14.257 --> 01:16.377
used to tell me that
I would never be alone

01:16.550 --> 01:18.395
as long as I had a good book.

01:19.439 --> 01:20.222
Good thing.

01:20.736 --> 01:22.331
You ready to go to
Susie's birthday party?

01:22.527 --> 01:24.467
No. My book's getting good.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.202
George, we RSVP'd.

01:27.273 --> 01:29.828
I didn't RSVP anything.

01:30.872 --> 01:33.525
- We bought her a present.
- What did you get her?

01:33.831 --> 01:36.156
We got her a flannel nightgown,

01:36.571 --> 01:37.928
with pretty little flowers on it.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.654
Mom, you're going toget me killed.

01:40.737 --> 01:42.601
Georgia, don't be silly. We're going.

01:42.720 --> 01:44.072
- Not.
- You are so.

01:44.153 --> 01:46.565
- So not.
- Why do you have to be so obstinate?

01:46.760 --> 01:47.697
"Obstinate."

01:48.008 --> 01:53.278
O-B-S-T-I-N-A-T-E.

01:53.661 --> 01:54.577
"Stubborn."

01:54.818 --> 01:58.772
Georgia Lass, you cannot spend your
entire life with your nose stuck in a book.

01:59.340 --> 02:00.333
Try me.

02:01.150 --> 02:02.811
Reading didn't make me popular,

02:03.753 --> 02:06.426
and reading didn't
necessarily make me happy.

02:06.855 --> 02:10.229
What it did make me was
a really good speller.

02:10.435 --> 02:11.510
"Succedaneum."

02:11.595 --> 02:15.069
S-U-C-C-E-D-A-N-E-U-M.

02:15.201 --> 02:15.774
Fuck off.

02:16.512 --> 02:17.223
S...

02:18.223 --> 02:18.708
U...

02:19.282 --> 02:25.993
C-C-E-D-A-N-E-U-M.

02:26.179 --> 02:29.277
Nice one, Georgie. Nice one, Georgie.

02:29.436 --> 02:30.450
I was a reader.

02:30.531 --> 02:34.217
Focus, Harjeet. Eyes on the prize.
Your trophy, and 10,000 big ones!

02:34.535 --> 02:36.701
Mr. Akhtar, no talking to the finalists.

02:38.263 --> 02:39.808
I'm gunning for the nerd.

02:39.885 --> 02:41.712
And that would be which one?

02:42.614 --> 02:43.633
"Thanatos."

02:44.294 --> 02:45.047
Shit.

02:45.486 --> 02:47.038
Could I hear the definition, please?

02:47.258 --> 02:48.241
Desire for death.

02:48.374 --> 02:50.361
"An instinctual desire for death."

02:50.642 --> 02:51.697
Very nice, Mason.

02:51.809 --> 02:53.842
It is kind of in my
wheelhouse, isn't it?

02:54.376 --> 02:56.161
Come on, Franc. Kick his little ass.

02:56.239 --> 02:57.585
Go on, my son. Go on.

02:58.118 --> 03:01.273
Uh, shouldn't you be focusing on that?

03:01.400 --> 03:04.656
Uh, shouldn't you shut the fuck up so
he can spell the fucking word, Georgie?

03:04.843 --> 03:06.110
"Thanatos."

03:06.540 --> 03:08.820
T-H...

03:08.916 --> 03:11.964
A-N-A...

03:12.070 --> 03:13.916
T-O-S.

03:14.012 --> 03:15.638
"Thanatos."

03:17.793 --> 03:20.246
Excuse me. Mr. Mcfadden.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.373
That word is far too easy.

03:21.441 --> 03:23.137
- That's your guy.
- It's an insult.

03:23.232 --> 03:25.372
My son has had much
harder words. Much harder.

03:25.445 --> 03:28.921
Please remain silent, or you will
be asked to leave the auditorium.

03:31.241 --> 03:32.444
The next word is...

03:33.765 --> 03:34.792
"apoplectic."

03:36.024 --> 03:36.718
Miss it.

03:36.814 --> 03:37.255
Miss it.

03:37.353 --> 03:37.995
Miss it.

03:40.892 --> 03:42.268
Game over anyway.

03:43.441 --> 03:44.542
"Apoplectic."

03:46.119 --> 03:48.950
A-P...

03:50.735 --> 03:52.616
P-E-P...

03:52.816 --> 03:55.869
L-E-C-T-I-C.

03:56.048 --> 03:57.220
"Apoplectic."

03:57.506 --> 03:58.202
I'm sorry.

03:59.176 --> 04:02.478
- "Apoplectic" is
spelled A-P-- - No!

04:09.539 --> 04:10.599
What just happened?

04:12.392 --> 04:17.700
Oh, I'm afraid
you are D-E-D.

04:17.783 --> 04:19.928
That's
D-E-A-D.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.187
I was joking.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.614
Coffee, please, Kiffany.

04:23.692 --> 04:25.616
Does anyone ever order
the Elvis Presley?

04:25.702 --> 04:27.081
- Sure.
- What's in it?

04:27.177 --> 04:29.415
Peanut butter, bananas,
bacon, and cool whip.

04:29.553 --> 04:31.853
- What does that taste like?
- Death on a plate.

04:32.053 --> 04:33.328
Yeah, I'll just get the coffee.

04:34.627 --> 04:35.795
I hear you have a boyfriend.

04:37.713 --> 04:39.343
Who'd you hear that from?

04:39.733 --> 04:41.539
Doesn't matter who I
heard it from. Is it true?

04:41.637 --> 04:42.169
No.

04:43.218 --> 04:45.533
So you don't have a
boyfriend who's living

04:45.599 --> 04:48.278
and breathing and has no idea
that you're a grim reaper?

04:48.344 --> 04:49.696
Did roxy tell you that?

04:49.983 --> 04:52.102
- Tell me what?
- That I have a boyfriend.

04:52.717 --> 04:54.985
That handsome devil I saw
you leaving with last night?

04:55.040 --> 04:56.628
- Is that your boyfriend?
- No.

04:57.135 --> 04:57.780
Okay.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.599
Hey. How'd it go?

05:02.322 --> 05:04.795
G-R-E-A-T.

05:04.923 --> 05:06.065
It was a spelling bee.

05:06.469 --> 05:07.514
Seriously, how'd it go?

05:07.631 --> 05:11.435
F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C.

05:11.543 --> 05:12.673
How do I get it to stop?

05:12.899 --> 05:14.406
Well, go on, Georgie, tell him.

05:14.568 --> 05:19.193
As far as senseless, brutal deaths
go, I'd say it went beautifully.

05:19.243 --> 05:21.541
Yeah, so maybe a simple thank you

05:21.598 --> 05:24.876
is in order, instead of your
constant irritation, Rubie.

05:25.168 --> 05:28.778
Maybe a little
bit of G-R-A-T...

05:29.534 --> 05:30.222
uh...

05:31.682 --> 05:33.473
. ..itude.

05:36.708 --> 05:39.243
For you and you.

05:39.330 --> 05:40.109
Where's Roxy?

05:40.282 --> 05:42.725
She has got a personal day.

05:42.868 --> 05:44.685
Well,  why don't I have a personal day?

05:44.788 --> 05:48.797
Because you're
an F-U-C-K-U-P.

05:49.202 --> 05:50.717
"Fuck up" has two words.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.843
Actually, "fuck-up" is a hyphenate.

05:54.548 --> 05:55.510
Well, it is.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.692
This is in a bad part of town.

05:58.059 --> 06:00.595
I know that address. That's
the linklater boxing gym.

06:00.737 --> 06:02.484
Sounds sweaty and violent.

06:02.827 --> 06:04.035
Why don't you keep her company?

06:04.921 --> 06:08.551
I think I'm past the "I need
protection" stage, don't you?

06:08.608 --> 06:11.715
I don't think I'd consider
Mason's company "protection."

06:11.792 --> 06:13.681
Well, whatever it is, no thanks.

06:13.752 --> 06:15.412
You already have
company today, princess?

06:16.164 --> 06:18.242
Your boyfriend riding
shotgun for your reap?

06:19.001 --> 06:21.084
I don't have a boyfriend, okay?

06:21.269 --> 06:22.165
I don't have a boyfriend.

06:22.216 --> 06:25.718
Mason, I would love it if you
could come with me to the gym.

06:25.754 --> 06:26.466
I'd feel safer.

06:26.527 --> 06:27.812
I would be so happy to.

06:29.232 --> 06:30.495
B-Y-E.

06:33.757 --> 06:34.776
Tell me about her boyfriend.

06:36.815 --> 06:39.179
Uh, Kiffany? I haven't met him.

06:40.469 --> 06:41.964
Blueberry pancakes.

06:44.258 --> 06:44.909
What?

06:45.850 --> 06:46.680
What did you do?

06:48.134 --> 06:49.548
I made blueberry pancakes.

06:49.614 --> 06:51.298
You make those when you feel guilty.

06:51.427 --> 06:52.732
That's not true.

06:54.950 --> 06:56.300
Why are you dressed like a realtor?

06:57.396 --> 06:59.607
Because I'm going out job hunting.

06:59.936 --> 07:00.815
Why?

07:01.359 --> 07:03.662
Because they give you
money at the end of the day.

07:05.286 --> 07:07.292
I'm just looking for
something temporary.

07:07.908 --> 07:09.643
You know, office work.

07:09.744 --> 07:10.630
Sounds boring.

07:11.313 --> 07:13.186
Well, Reggie,it's either that or

07:13.555 --> 07:15.576
we sell the dog to a chinese restaurant.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.729
That's not funny.

07:18.483 --> 07:20.265
All right, I guess
that's not a good idea.

07:21.078 --> 07:22.862
Golden Retrievers just
aren't good eatin'.

07:23.236 --> 07:25.249
So when you're at work,
who's going to watch me?

07:26.043 --> 07:27.218
Who do you want to watch you?

07:28.120 --> 07:29.176
No one.

07:31.855 --> 07:33.742
Daisy has alleged in the past

07:34.085 --> 07:36.579
that she has had dalliances with men,

07:37.414 --> 07:41.327
sexual escapades with people who
were alive while she was a reaper.

07:42.611 --> 07:43.487
If so...

07:44.608 --> 07:45.539
it's a blunder.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.096
Charlie Chaplin, Tyrone
Powers, Babe Ruth...

07:50.241 --> 07:51.152
I've heard the stories.

07:51.209 --> 07:54.506
Douglas Fairbanks, Errol
Flynn, William Holden--

07:54.568 --> 07:55.280
I get it.

07:56.574 --> 07:57.343
William holden?

07:57.399 --> 07:58.776
Yeah, I don't know who that is either.

07:58.853 --> 07:59.903
Sunset boulevard?

08:00.491 --> 08:01.843
Face down in the swimming pool?

08:04.797 --> 08:05.437
Jesus.

08:07.368 --> 08:09.033
The point, George, is that, uh...

08:10.419 --> 08:13.076
these alleged indiscretions...

08:15.168 --> 08:16.645
they were not on my watch.

08:17.367 --> 08:19.384
I am not a snitch, Rube.

08:19.446 --> 08:20.827
I'm not telling on Daisy.

08:20.982 --> 08:22.482
Georgia, snitching is not the point.

08:22.993 --> 08:25.616
The point is, she shouldn't be
involved with someone living.

08:26.081 --> 08:26.901
The point is,

08:27.989 --> 08:30.099
keep the syrup away from the eggs.

08:30.267 --> 08:31.196
I like syrup on my eggs.

08:31.698 --> 08:32.318
Who's that?

08:32.485 --> 08:33.715
- Who's who?
- This.

08:34.836 --> 08:35.917
George, right?

08:36.934 --> 08:39.076
Yeah, Daisy told me this
is one of her haunts.

08:39.926 --> 08:41.821
- Hey. Ray summers.
- Rube.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.528
Quite a death grip you got there, Rube.

08:46.725 --> 08:47.647
You seen my girl?

08:48.530 --> 08:49.832
Oh, she just left.

08:50.841 --> 08:52.419
So much for timing.

08:52.629 --> 08:53.643
What's your story, Ray?

08:54.729 --> 08:57.979
My story is that I'm
a television producer.

08:58.517 --> 09:01.689
- You may have seen my program. It's--
- I don't watch that much television.

09:02.987 --> 09:03.923
Let me guess.

09:04.825 --> 09:06.673
-  You're a reader.
- I'm a reader.

09:07.732 --> 09:09.423
How do you know daisy, Ray?

09:09.616 --> 09:12.782
Met her in a bar, bought
her a drink... or three.

09:13.308 --> 09:15.818
We may have been a little
over-served that night.

09:16.191 --> 09:17.378
So you're just drinking buddies?

09:17.497 --> 09:18.670
No. No, no.

09:19.443 --> 09:23.088
Daisy's my, uh... my good luck charm.

09:24.291 --> 09:25.510
Charm, perhaps.

09:26.765 --> 09:27.536
Good luck...

09:28.167 --> 09:29.385
not in my experience.

09:29.677 --> 09:31.859
Well, maybe not in
your experience, but...

09:33.728 --> 09:35.248
actually, come to think of it,

09:36.491 --> 09:38.402
the night I met her, some guy died.

09:39.577 --> 09:41.171
- You were there.
- No, I wasn't.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.152
I wasn't.

09:47.501 --> 09:50.650
- So how do you know Daisy, Rube?
- That's not any of your business.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.027
Wow. Don't candy-coat it for me, Rube.

09:55.088 --> 09:57.178
- If I'm not welcome here--
- You are not welcome here.

09:58.478 --> 10:00.453
Did I say something to offend you?

10:00.873 --> 10:02.537
- No.
- Then what's your problem?

10:02.979 --> 10:05.160
I just don't like
strangers all that much,

10:05.539 --> 10:09.409
and I did not invite you to sit down at
this table with people you do not know.

10:09.465 --> 10:13.055
- Actually, Rube, I know george here.
- You don't know me.

10:20.341 --> 10:21.483
Okay.

10:22.369 --> 10:23.716
You folks have a nice day.

10:27.970 --> 10:29.306
I do not like him.

10:29.463 --> 10:33.207
Don't  you want to just slap
that smile right off his face?

10:41.394 --> 10:44.641
Yeah, so I really don't think it's a
good idea for you to invite Ray to a reap.

10:44.926 --> 10:46.929
Oh, suddenly you're the responsible one.

10:47.001 --> 10:47.616
Come on.

10:47.963 --> 10:49.883
It's reckless. He might see something.

10:49.986 --> 10:53.151
Please. He doesn't notice
anything. He's blinded by love.

10:54.733 --> 10:55.408
Ha!

10:57.798 --> 11:00.605
You are flirting with
disaster, Daisy Adair.

11:00.739 --> 11:02.626
You just don't like it
that I'm flirting at all.

11:02.831 --> 11:04.005
Come on.

11:04.449 --> 11:06.902
I'm not interested in
you in that way anymore...

11:07.339 --> 11:08.136
actually.

11:09.042 --> 11:09.851
Really.

11:11.199 --> 11:11.971
Anymore.

11:12.059 --> 11:13.204
- I believe you.
- Good.

11:16.016 --> 11:17.594
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

11:46.859 --> 11:47.797
How's it going?

11:53.844 --> 11:54.579
What's your name?

11:55.014 --> 11:55.856
Crystal.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.115
Um, will miss Herbig be back soon?

12:17.448 --> 12:18.641
I don't like hospitals.

12:19.241 --> 12:19.895
Why?

12:20.416 --> 12:21.994
Who the hell likes hospitals?

12:22.819 --> 12:25.261
Well, let's see.

12:26.414 --> 12:28.190
Doctors, nurses,

12:28.999 --> 12:29.834
orderlies.

12:31.379 --> 12:33.157
People who are sick
and want to get better.

12:33.233 --> 12:35.839
People  who know people who are
sick and want them to get better.

12:36.843 --> 12:40.201
I don't see anyone around here who
looks like they're getting any better.

12:41.577 --> 12:43.734
Well, it's the long-term care ward.

12:45.260 --> 12:47.455
They're probably not going
out the way they came in.

12:54.157 --> 12:56.519
- Do we know her?
- We do.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.749
Natural causes is one of the...

12:59.810 --> 13:01.593
nicer assignments for a reaper,

13:01.894 --> 13:03.339
especially in a hospital.

13:03.882 --> 13:05.176
No chasing anyone down.

13:05.239 --> 13:06.770
Everyone's got a name tag.

13:07.023 --> 13:08.038
Nice gig.

13:09.176 --> 13:11.351
Except everyone's really old.

13:11.873 --> 13:13.441
You got something against old people?

13:13.513 --> 13:15.785
They just freak me out a little,

13:16.268 --> 13:18.818
and the really old ones irritate me.

13:18.914 --> 13:19.938
That's nice.

13:20.865 --> 13:25.186
You know when they're crossing
a street at the "walk" sign,

13:25.334 --> 13:29.011
and the time is ticking by,

13:29.078 --> 13:31.632
and even if they start right away,

13:31.694 --> 13:36.942
they still never make it across on time.

13:39.829 --> 13:40.849
That irritates you?

13:43.036 --> 13:44.966
They're really slow.

13:47.136 --> 13:48.866
- Go find your reap.
- Okay.

13:50.095 --> 13:50.859
How?

13:51.586 --> 13:52.272
Hey, Bud,

13:52.537 --> 13:56.099
do you have an N. Rommey on this floor?

13:56.160 --> 13:57.427
It's N. Rommey, like "mommy."

13:57.607 --> 13:59.428
Nina. Room 331.

14:00.095 --> 14:01.401
See? It's a nice gig.

14:03.801 --> 14:04.671
I'll see you later.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.915
My bonny lies over the ocean

14:12.967 --> 14:16.388
my bonny lies over the sea

14:16.930 --> 14:18.998
my bonny
lies over--

14:19.119 --> 14:20.150
Are we there yet?

14:20.964 --> 14:21.553
Where?

14:21.631 --> 14:22.516
Are we there yet?

14:22.987 --> 14:24.907
Well, I don't believe we are.

14:25.577 --> 14:27.073
Are you N. Rommey?

14:27.298 --> 14:28.782
Yes. No.

14:29.392 --> 14:32.509
My bonny lies over the ocean

14:32.860 --> 14:35.668
my bonny lies over the sea

14:35.959 --> 14:39.509
my bonny lies over the ocean

14:39.714 --> 14:41.946
so bring back my bonny to me.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.608
Like I said, they freak me out a little.

14:50.018 --> 14:53.435
Now, you know it's better
when you stay in your room.

14:53.504 --> 14:54.148
My room.

14:54.336 --> 14:56.861
Uh, is this... Nina?

14:57.097 --> 15:00.265
I am mrs. Nina Rommey. How do you do?

15:04.342 --> 15:06.824
- Nina, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:08.560 --> 15:11.894
We're hearing a story
today. It's a fairy tale.

15:13.069 --> 15:17.018
Well, once upon a time, you
were alive, then you died.

15:17.335 --> 15:18.063
The end.

15:18.554 --> 15:20.617
Oh, hey, I know you.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.357
You're the one who was
killed by a toilet seat.

15:23.454 --> 15:25.692
God, will anyone ever let that go?

15:25.769 --> 15:29.184
- Blah, blah, blah,
blah-- - Blah, blah, blah.

15:29.424 --> 15:32.138
- I'm Penny.
- I'm George.

15:32.240 --> 15:36.029
Nina, this is George. She's
come to take care of you.

15:37.714 --> 15:40.161
We have to go. We really
don't want to be late.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.356
Oh, we won't be.

15:45.130 --> 15:46.321
Kate Hepburn boxed.

15:47.355 --> 15:48.814
Also Kitty Lombard.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.526
It's a great acting exercise.

15:53.603 --> 15:55.546
I need to find my reap
before ray gets here.

15:55.855 --> 15:56.673
Good idea.

16:00.529 --> 16:02.597
He'll be dead and gone
before Ray even shows up.

16:05.907 --> 16:07.425
Boxers are really beautiful.

16:10.856 --> 16:12.274
Boxers are really beautiful.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.942
Ray's really beautiful.

16:15.494 --> 16:16.861
I'll tell you who's beautiful, Daisy.

16:18.054 --> 16:20.569
I'll tell you who's beautiful.
It's fucking me. I'm beautiful.

16:20.655 --> 16:22.744
Yeah. Yeah, I'm hot.

16:23.461 --> 16:25.161
I'm hot. I can box. I can box.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.672
Who is it, crowd? Who is it?

16:26.728 --> 16:27.977
It's kid Mason!

16:28.106 --> 16:31.941
Yeah! Kid Mason. Kid Mason.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.469
Yeah, the Masonator. The Masonator.

16:35.166 --> 16:37.265
Shake it out, shake
it out, shake it out.

16:37.941 --> 16:40.696
Yeah, you're not so fucking
beautiful now, are you, Ray?

16:40.987 --> 16:42.661
Whoa! Easy, tiger.

16:44.075 --> 16:45.248
Ooh. Sorry, mate.

16:45.785 --> 16:47.445
Daisy called me. Good for you.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.509
Asked me to meet her here.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.338
- And?
- And I'm here.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.423
Are you her lap dog, Ray?

17:03.023 --> 17:05.017
Did you just bark at me?

17:06.460 --> 17:07.766
No. No.

17:07.882 --> 17:09.998
Can you box, Ray? Can you?

17:10.387 --> 17:13.219
Bit of boxing, hey? Can you? Huh?

17:13.813 --> 17:16.030
I've had my share of fights,
if that's your question.

17:16.791 --> 17:17.392
Really?

17:18.076 --> 17:20.042
Oh, I'm just asking,
because, uh, you know...

17:21.473 --> 17:22.915
not every man can box.

17:23.325 --> 17:24.161
You know what I mean?

17:24.396 --> 17:26.380
Something you want to say to me, Mason?

17:27.232 --> 17:27.826
No.

17:28.869 --> 17:29.731
Well, then...

17:32.221 --> 17:34.533
don't stand so fucking close.

17:37.753 --> 17:39.270
Seriously.

17:39.970 --> 17:40.995
Step back.

17:41.865 --> 17:43.464
You step back.

17:50.702 --> 17:51.732
Okay.

17:52.843 --> 17:54.373
Okay, Mason, you win.

17:55.358 --> 17:57.861
You get to take home the big prize.

17:59.431 --> 18:00.559
Oh, no, wait.

18:03.952 --> 18:04.603
I do.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.302
Fuck off, you righteous
fucking cocksucker.

18:15.186 --> 18:16.472
Pardon me, I'm looking for a...

18:16.554 --> 18:18.300
I think it's a mr. Washington.

18:18.437 --> 18:19.063
It's Kid.

18:19.891 --> 18:20.697
Kid washington.

18:21.228 --> 18:24.218
You are just so much more
handsome up close than in the ring.

18:25.999 --> 18:27.281
I'm not the Kid.

18:29.725 --> 18:30.805
Oh. Oh.

18:31.795 --> 18:33.087
What can I do for you, miss?

18:33.190 --> 18:34.212
Oh, I...

18:34.720 --> 18:37.100
- I just wanted to meet you.
- I'm Kid Washington,

18:37.156 --> 18:37.858
and you are...

18:37.935 --> 18:39.369
I'm Daisy. Daisy Adair.

18:39.496 --> 18:40.213
Mm-hmm.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.348
My  father used to talk about you.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.404
Oh, is that so?

18:43.618 --> 18:46.716
Yeah, he said your harrison fight was...

18:47.300 --> 18:48.089
a classic.

18:48.570 --> 18:52.360
15 rounds. Yeah, that was some fight.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.932
Well, it's an honor to meet you, Kid.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.492
Well, nice of you to
stop by today, miss.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.510
All right, Louis.

19:10.438 --> 19:12.782
Showing off is an easy way to get hurt.

19:19.238 --> 19:22.189
Chris, code blue in 301.
Get me dr. Rothschild.

19:24.886 --> 19:26.579
- Is that the school bell?
- Sure.

19:26.653 --> 19:27.743
We're going to be late for class.

19:27.968 --> 19:30.866
Oh, no, we won't.
We'll be right on time.

19:31.399 --> 19:33.037
Ooh. Thank you.

19:37.850 --> 19:39.320
Oh, I have to take these.

19:43.442 --> 19:45.115
I'd seen a lot
of people die--

19:45.597 --> 19:49.119
hit by a bus, mauled by a
bear, torn up by a lawnmower--

19:49.611 --> 19:53.333
but this quiet mistake
I couldn't make sense of.

19:56.910 --> 19:58.971
Then again, neither could Nina.

20:00.327 --> 20:02.263
I know I wasn't supposed to interfere,

20:02.324 --> 20:05.483
but I just wanted to stop
her before it was too late.

20:05.784 --> 20:06.394
Nina.

20:09.088 --> 20:10.904
Let's go back to your room.

20:13.352 --> 20:14.714
Your hair is so pretty.

20:15.651 --> 20:16.419
Thank you.

20:23.761 --> 20:24.991
Get me out of this.

20:26.173 --> 20:26.983
Are you kidding?

20:27.079 --> 20:29.337
Two boys fighting
over me? It's my dream.

20:30.294 --> 20:31.104
Lovely.

20:31.165 --> 20:32.864
I'm not fighting over
you, but this could hurt.

20:32.938 --> 20:33.797
You heal fast.

20:37.247 --> 20:39.393
That doesn't take away
from the hurty-painy bit.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.327
You forgot to kiss me for good luck.

20:48.426 --> 20:50.165
Not in front of Mason.
Hey, go easy on him.

20:50.279 --> 20:52.639
Easy on him? I think that
ship's pretty much sailed.

20:52.731 --> 20:54.661
Why do you have to be like
that? Why do you have to be mean?

20:54.728 --> 20:57.145
Hey, I'm just finishing
what you started, sweetheart.

20:57.216 --> 20:58.605
You're the one who put
the guy in harm's way.

20:58.682 --> 20:59.382
No, I didn't.

20:59.494 --> 21:01.103
You're involved with two men, Daisy.

21:01.645 --> 21:03.207
That story never ends well.

21:03.288 --> 21:04.354
Now, shut up and kiss me.

21:12.023 --> 21:12.931
Let's go.

21:25.940 --> 21:27.374
We all like working with Ricky.

21:28.854 --> 21:29.709
That's nice.

21:30.646 --> 21:33.222
Ricky was doing velum binding
on, like, his third day here.

21:33.948 --> 21:35.038
Delores didn't even talk to me

21:35.079 --> 21:37.367
about that kind of responsibility
until at least week two.

21:38.198 --> 21:39.518
And he's excellent about recycling.

21:40.456 --> 21:41.234
I'm sorry,

21:41.291 --> 21:42.567
I don't know who you're talking about.

21:43.759 --> 21:44.746
Aren't you Ricky's mom?

21:45.572 --> 21:46.170
No.

21:46.589 --> 21:48.811
He said his mom was
visiting him today at lunch.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.558
You look like you could be his mom.

21:50.629 --> 21:52.668
- Well, I'm not her.
- Are you sure?

21:53.707 --> 21:55.866
Yeah, I'm here to be
placed... for a job.

21:57.055 --> 21:58.949
That's... that's really brave.

22:00.545 --> 22:01.447
"Brave?"

22:02.897 --> 22:04.458
Yeah, I mean, to just...

22:07.674 --> 22:10.080
Do you want half a sandwich? It's tuna.

22:10.224 --> 22:11.090
No, thanks.

22:18.698 --> 22:20.546
Hi. I'm Delores Herbig.

22:20.592 --> 22:23.676
- Crystal tells me you're...
- Joy. Joy Lass.

22:23.751 --> 22:26.751
Well, why don't you follow me to my
cubicle, and we'll have a chat, ms. Lass...

22:26.972 --> 22:27.785
or is it mrs.?

22:28.058 --> 22:29.015
Ms. is fine.

22:45.815 --> 22:46.683
Coming?

22:48.143 --> 22:48.711
Yes.

22:50.913 --> 22:52.367
I'm a little rusty, so help me out here.

22:52.623 --> 22:54.425
Is that the two-step
or the cha-cha?

22:54.630 --> 22:58.285
Cha, cha-cha-chance to beat your
white, pasty ass, motherfucker.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.545
I'm not familiar with that one.

23:03.347 --> 23:04.911
Need a little help there, Ginger?

23:05.459 --> 23:07.610
Should I just kill him or
send him to the hospital?

23:07.666 --> 23:09.498
Seriously, don't hurt him. Play nice.

23:09.555 --> 23:10.851
It's a fight, Daisy.

23:10.897 --> 23:12.149
You're going to have to pick a corner.

23:12.218 --> 23:13.574
I don't want to pick a corner.

23:15.858 --> 23:17.040
He looks like a bleeder.

23:17.517 --> 23:18.863
The drunks bleed like hell.

23:19.436 --> 23:20.748
Yeah, I don't need to see this.

23:21.116 --> 23:22.780
I don't need to see any of this.

23:22.842 --> 23:26.405
Hey. Hey! Don't walk away from
me when I'm talking to you.

23:29.715 --> 23:30.722
Come on, bitch.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.262
Come on, bitch.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.771
Now you've made me mad.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.238
I'm actually really sorry, Ray,

23:37.285 --> 23:39.944
because this is a gentleman's
sport, isn't it, so...

23:40.604 --> 23:44.274
so fuck off,
bitchety-bitchy-bitch! Come on!

23:45.134 --> 23:46.436
Yeah, go on, darling.

23:46.491 --> 23:48.192
Hide that pretty face
of yours, sweetheart,

23:48.252 --> 23:51.263
because you are going
to leave here hurting.

23:51.416 --> 23:57.049
Your unborn children and
grandchildren and step-half...

23:57.115 --> 24:01.124
bloody two-headed nephews are going to
be feeling the fucking pain, beeotch!

24:01.339 --> 24:01.953
Come on!

24:02.046 --> 24:05.396
Like the pain you feel every time I take
your precious Daisy home and fuck her?

24:10.017 --> 24:12.440
Whoa. Kid. You all right?

24:13.316 --> 24:14.554
Get up, Kid. Come on.

24:18.952 --> 24:19.982
Am I getting up?

24:20.025 --> 24:21.840
No.

24:22.680 --> 24:23.146
Oh.

24:23.443 --> 24:24.979
Yeah. Sorry.

24:25.905 --> 24:27.072
You're down for the count.

24:28.111 --> 24:31.056
Night-night. I'm sleepy.

24:31.349 --> 24:32.142
I know.

24:33.989 --> 24:35.833
We shouldn't cut class today.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.716
Come on, under the covers.

24:40.941 --> 24:43.083
Book reports are due today.
Did you read the book?

24:44.220 --> 24:45.223
I loved it.

24:46.371 --> 24:47.420
Yeah, me too.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.859
- Are we there yet?
- I think so.

25:00.507 --> 25:03.942
- I love the eighth grade.
- Yeah.

25:04.910 --> 25:06.348
Eighth grade was fun.

25:11.540 --> 25:14.889
History major, with a
business minor in college,

25:15.314 --> 25:17.735
executive secretary for two law firms...

25:18.012 --> 25:20.890
and I know gregg shorthand
and medical shorthand.

25:21.024 --> 25:24.679
Oh, wonderful. Your resume
is so well-organized.

25:24.766 --> 25:27.413
Let's just input you into the databank.

25:27.766 --> 25:30.761
I know I've heard your name before.

25:30.828 --> 25:33.311
You know, your name sounds
familiar to me as well.

25:33.368 --> 25:34.735
Really? Huh.

25:37.612 --> 25:38.621
Oh, my goodness.

25:40.215 --> 25:42.492
Are you any relation to
the young woman who died?

25:43.108 --> 25:45.211
That was my daughter. George.

25:45.282 --> 25:46.403
I hired her.

25:47.461 --> 25:48.693
Georgia Lass.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.996
You're the woman who gave her the job.

25:55.011 --> 25:57.515
You called the house. You
and I spoke on the phone.

26:09.886 --> 26:11.651
I'm sorry for your loss.

26:12.168 --> 26:12.915
Thank you.

26:13.684 --> 26:17.903
I didn't spend much time with
your daughter. She seemed sweet.

26:18.021 --> 26:19.484
- Did she?
- No.

26:20.632 --> 26:23.002
She seemed complicated. Smart.

26:24.645 --> 26:27.094
- What else?
- Difficult.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.596
A handful... but promising,

26:30.012 --> 26:31.618
which is why I hired her.

26:34.922 --> 26:37.563
We don't have to do this now, ms. Lass.

26:37.624 --> 26:39.750
We can reschedule,
or not do it at all--

26:39.827 --> 26:40.487
No.

26:41.781 --> 26:44.332
I'm here. I'm fine.

26:45.255 --> 26:46.319
I want to work.

26:49.959 --> 26:52.009
- It's "Joy."
- Okay.

26:54.945 --> 26:57.022
What do you want to do, Joy?

26:57.093 --> 26:58.617
What's your passion? What do you like?

26:58.960 --> 27:00.869
Oh, I don't know.

27:01.684 --> 27:04.853
Well, uh, we have a number of, um...

27:05.165 --> 27:07.183
I like making lists.

27:08.202 --> 27:11.079
I like boxes.

27:11.975 --> 27:13.061
Files.

27:13.937 --> 27:14.970
Shelves.

27:15.119 --> 27:16.604
Self-sticking labels.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.685
Me too.

27:23.691 --> 27:28.759
- So she was in this office?
- Yes.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.320
What did George do
that last day, for work?

27:38.283 --> 27:41.810
I really, uh... don't remember.

27:45.250 --> 27:46.413
Okay, everyone,

27:46.767 --> 27:49.598
I know that you all think that you
couldn't live without the internet,

27:49.863 --> 27:51.461
but before online research,

27:51.614 --> 27:52.797
there were card catalogues

27:53.027 --> 27:54.839
and paper cards in library book pockets.

27:55.198 --> 27:56.862
Oh, reggie, don't play with those books.

27:56.981 --> 27:58.348
They haven't been bar-coded yet.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.580
They still have those antiquated
check-out cards in them.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.485
Sy Benjamin,

28:02.567 --> 28:05.541
if that is a skin magazine I
see you holding, so help me...

28:28.819 --> 28:30.420
Do you know who this is?

28:31.971 --> 28:32.883
I don't remember.

28:33.584 --> 28:35.351
This is your husband, William.

28:35.591 --> 28:37.517
- Who?
- William.

28:38.423 --> 28:40.020
There will be a quiz on this material.

28:40.116 --> 28:41.699
Yeah, I know, and actually,

28:41.772 --> 28:43.859
I think you're late for
that quiz, so this way...

28:43.984 --> 28:44.356
No.

28:46.202 --> 28:46.966
Oh!

28:49.784 --> 28:51.530
Nina, you really need to follow me.

28:51.586 --> 28:54.023
- Don't tell me what to do.
- You're dead, Nina.

28:54.161 --> 28:56.629
This is the lady who brushes my hair.

28:56.752 --> 29:01.380
Yes. That is your daughter,
Beth... and you are dead.

29:09.711 --> 29:11.933
So who is this, this Rosie?

29:12.409 --> 29:13.496
Nobody you know.

29:13.910 --> 29:16.275
Is it somebody you knew?
Is she related to you?

29:18.231 --> 29:20.316
- Is she related to you?
- Yes.

29:25.082 --> 29:25.911
Beau chene.

29:26.699 --> 29:28.973
That's a decent hospital? They
take good care of people there?

29:30.248 --> 29:32.173
No, Rube, they water them once a week.

29:32.987 --> 29:35.568
Look at you, driving on
the wrong side of the road.

29:36.141 --> 29:37.180
It's not good.

29:38.216 --> 29:39.044
Thanks for this.

29:39.182 --> 29:40.656
- How's Der Waffle Haus?
- Good.

29:40.893 --> 29:41.978
- Kiffany?
- Fine.

29:42.064 --> 29:44.011
- Your merry band of reapers?
- They're awful.

29:44.072 --> 29:45.376
Okay, you have to help me.

29:45.521 --> 29:47.588
- She's one of the better ones.
- Better one what?

29:48.074 --> 29:49.617
What's the problem, George?

29:49.969 --> 29:52.288
I can't get her to go.
She won't follow me.

29:52.499 --> 29:56.023
- Nina forgets things.
- Yeah, I picked up on that.

29:57.267 --> 29:59.858
What penny's saying is
she has no idea she's dead.

30:00.344 --> 30:02.914
I get that. How do I get her to go?

30:03.743 --> 30:04.926
I'm telling you, George,

30:05.025 --> 30:07.200
you have to get nina to
connect to her own death

30:07.291 --> 30:08.598
before she can move on.

30:08.664 --> 30:10.227
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

30:10.314 --> 30:11.563
Ooh, she's got a mouth on her.

30:11.654 --> 30:13.601
Always a pleasure, Penny.
I'll see you around the campus.

30:13.693 --> 30:15.633
Are you kidding me? You're just bolting?

30:15.679 --> 30:17.651
I got fish to fry, little Georgia.

30:24.065 --> 30:27.982
- Hey, I'm on my lunch break.
- Oh, come on. Please?

30:28.069 --> 30:30.178
Sorry, honey, can't do it.

30:30.255 --> 30:31.433
Come on. I don't...

30:32.775 --> 30:35.535
I don't really like old people.

30:35.670 --> 30:37.126
Then you're one lucky girl.

30:37.352 --> 30:39.712
- How so?
- Because you'll never be one.

30:41.571 --> 30:45.805
Listen, I have to report Nina's
time of death to the hospital,

30:47.085 --> 30:48.882
but I'll delay as long as I can.

30:51.201 --> 30:52.733
- So...
- So?

30:53.900 --> 30:55.328
Better get a move on...

30:57.280 --> 30:57.965
peanut.

31:02.087 --> 31:03.521
I would never become old.

31:03.838 --> 31:06.403
Dead and young has to be
better than alive and old.

31:06.849 --> 31:08.595
Isn't it? Right?

31:09.107 --> 31:10.520
At least I remember things.

31:15.814 --> 31:17.273
What happened?

31:18.098 --> 31:19.148
What do you mean, what happened?

31:19.372 --> 31:21.292
- You're labeling.
- I like to label.

31:21.733 --> 31:23.137
When something bad happens.

31:23.301 --> 31:25.077
I'm just reworking our shelving system.

31:25.650 --> 31:28.553
Once I started doing that, I realized
it was time to reorganize the pantry.

31:31.031 --> 31:32.362
Oh, honey, could you get that?

31:33.294 --> 31:34.810
You know what? I'm not
going to keep buying these

31:34.865 --> 31:37.318
chewy granola bar thingies
anymore if you don't eat them.

31:37.385 --> 31:38.942
You know, because I'm
not made of money here.

31:46.318 --> 31:47.385
Hi, boy.

31:49.424 --> 31:50.635
Hi, Claire.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.750
Oh, I'm sorry to bother
you, but your dog...

31:52.985 --> 31:55.693
your dog dropped a zoomer
into my nasturtiums.

31:55.909 --> 32:00.819
Well, claire, aren't zoomers
supposed to be good for nasturtiums?

32:01.095 --> 32:02.862
Small flowers, big dog.

32:03.707 --> 32:06.087
These flowers won a prize at
the Pickwick club last year.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.593
Yeah, I remember.

32:07.681 --> 32:09.999
So if you could just be a little
more careful with your dog...

32:10.133 --> 32:12.893
Uh, yeah, we will. Won't we?

32:12.994 --> 32:14.531
Don't look at me. I wasn't home.

32:17.871 --> 32:19.998
Quite a project you've
got going on here.

32:20.327 --> 32:21.229
Oh, my goodness.

32:21.802 --> 32:22.795
Are you moving?

32:23.219 --> 32:24.556
No, no, I'm just, uh...

32:24.801 --> 32:26.020
reorganizing my kitchen.

32:26.133 --> 32:27.838
Oh, it's breathtaking.

32:28.108 --> 32:28.816
Thank you.

32:28.892 --> 32:30.628
You can see where
everything is right away.

32:30.726 --> 32:32.825
Well, a place for everything,
and everything in its place.

32:33.664 --> 32:36.568
- Did you do all this yourself?
- I did.

32:38.391 --> 32:39.204
Do you think...

32:40.854 --> 32:43.460
would you ever come over
and do this to my kitchen?

32:44.693 --> 32:46.408
Yeah, I could do that...

32:48.502 --> 32:50.212
for 75 an hour.

32:56.069 --> 32:57.345
How about thursday?

32:58.524 --> 32:59.464
Thursday's good.

33:08.926 --> 33:09.858
What did Rube say?

33:09.981 --> 33:12.377
He said I have to make her
connect to her own death.

33:12.644 --> 33:15.197
This bloody job never
bloody ends, does it?

33:15.249 --> 33:16.202
K-k-k-katy

33:16.299 --> 33:18.658
beautiful katy

33:18.869 --> 33:22.524
you're the only
g-g-girl that I adore

33:22.739 --> 33:23.928
What's with the post-its?

33:24.108 --> 33:25.269
She forgets things.

33:25.616 --> 33:26.887
They remind her of things...

33:27.461 --> 33:28.260
or not.

33:30.030 --> 33:31.905
Mason, don't. It's not helping.

33:31.982 --> 33:33.267
You're going to get her all riled up.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.003
- Yeah, fight's over, Mason.
- What fight?

33:35.264 --> 33:36.820
- Ray hit him.
- I hit him back,

33:37.081 --> 33:38.521
and he nearly bloody died.

33:38.848 --> 33:41.279
When the m-m-moon
shines over the cowshed

33:41.326 --> 33:42.212
You know what, Daisy?

33:42.586 --> 33:44.505
- Ray's an asshole.
- Ray's an asshole.

33:44.598 --> 33:45.356
See?

33:45.422 --> 33:47.849
Nina can't remember a thing, and
even she can figure that one out.

33:47.905 --> 33:49.512
Yeah, well, I'm not
going to see him anymore.

33:49.743 --> 33:50.511
Really?

33:50.588 --> 33:51.469
I'm done.

33:51.679 --> 33:54.161
Good. Excellent.
Moving on--

33:54.208 --> 33:56.732
I'll be waiting at
the k-k-kitchen door

33:56.778 --> 33:59.358
So, this is Nina?

33:59.431 --> 34:02.281
This is Nina, whether
she knows it or not.

34:05.318 --> 34:06.762
Hello, nina. Hello, my darling.

34:06.839 --> 34:07.588
Hello.

34:07.731 --> 34:09.034
I have to tell you something.

34:09.103 --> 34:10.955
You have to listen to me very carefully.

34:11.027 --> 34:13.382
It might upset you,
but listen to me, okay?

34:13.428 --> 34:14.989
James Bond.

34:15.835 --> 34:17.878
You're dead. You snuffed it.

34:18.103 --> 34:20.109
Shaken but not stirred.

34:20.187 --> 34:22.286
Okay, she's batty.
She's gone. She's gone.

34:22.362 --> 34:23.530
Is there anything valuable in here?

34:23.601 --> 34:25.052
No. She can't remember a thing.

34:25.107 --> 34:26.859
She doesn't even know who she is.

34:26.918 --> 34:29.011
- I have a thought.
- You're very pretty.

34:29.071 --> 34:30.775
- Oh, thank you.
- Perfect.

34:31.606 --> 34:33.422
She seems pretty lucid to me.

34:38.569 --> 34:39.454
Dad?

34:40.297 --> 34:41.364
Hello, Beth.

34:42.946 --> 34:44.887
Your husband, William.

34:45.681 --> 34:47.606
Your daughter, Beth.

34:48.947 --> 34:51.112
Dad, I have some horrible news.

34:51.231 --> 34:52.004
What is it?

34:52.224 --> 34:54.420
Mom is dead.

34:56.161 --> 35:00.913
Dead? Your mother? Dead? Nina?

35:01.021 --> 35:03.437
Sitting right there? Dead?

35:04.845 --> 35:10.507
Woe is us. Woe is me. Just woe. Dead.

35:10.723 --> 35:12.976
Really fucking dead.

35:15.816 --> 35:16.852
Was I all right? Was that good?

35:16.950 --> 35:18.028
- Yeah, it was incredible.
- I had fun.

35:18.123 --> 35:19.379
Yeah, but not that great.

35:19.679 --> 35:22.129
How do you explain to
someone what death is?

35:22.215 --> 35:25.335
What do I say?  "Death
is like..."  what?

35:27.005 --> 35:28.468
It's like a play, right?

35:28.766 --> 35:30.977
The swan song, the last act...

35:31.498 --> 35:33.221
The fat lady singing.

35:34.650 --> 35:35.601
That's what it is.

35:36.246 --> 35:37.255
The final curtain.

35:48.718 --> 35:51.607
How do I tell someone who doesn't
understand that the show's over?

36:05.517 --> 36:08.810
How do I tell someone who
doesn't quite understand the words

36:08.865 --> 36:10.652
that it's okay to leave?

36:21.645 --> 36:24.636
Reggie needs to disappear.

36:25.455 --> 36:28.005
Reggie, look at that face.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.715
Look at the monkey face.

36:29.821 --> 36:31.111
Yes, you are. You are so cute.

36:31.180 --> 36:33.913
Does the little monkey
know how precious she is?

36:34.001 --> 36:35.607
She is so perfect.

36:36.847 --> 36:37.840
Just perfect.

36:39.063 --> 36:40.575
Daddy loves you.

36:40.753 --> 36:41.430
Mom?

36:41.670 --> 36:42.279
Yeah, george?

36:42.417 --> 36:44.030
I don't want Reggie to die.

36:45.368 --> 36:46.242
Okay.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.142
That's good, sweetie.

36:48.566 --> 36:50.993
Well, no one here wants
anyone to die, George.

36:56.305 --> 36:57.577
What do we do?

36:57.732 --> 37:00.071
Not a thing. It's sibling rivalry.

37:00.164 --> 37:01.855
Spock says it's completely normal.

37:02.024 --> 37:04.736
"I don't want Reggie
to die" is not normal.

37:04.879 --> 37:08.904
Relax, Joy. It'll disappear.
She'll forget she ever said it.

37:12.908 --> 37:14.080
How's your book, sweetie?

37:15.028 --> 37:15.759
Pretty good.

37:18.493 --> 37:19.508
How's your thumb?

37:21.101 --> 37:22.565
Hey, could I have one?

37:22.688 --> 37:24.740
Did you see she made a raisin
sandwich? Put a raisin right in there.

37:25.792 --> 37:27.592
Look what she did. Look what
she did. She did that herself.

37:33.026 --> 37:35.081
- Look, she made that.
- She did that?

37:42.612 --> 37:45.518
Nina couldn't move on
because she couldn't remember,

37:45.630 --> 37:48.851
but most of us are haunted
by the things we can't forget.

37:48.906 --> 37:50.423
- Are we there yet?
- Are we there yet?

37:54.090 --> 37:56.904
- Stop it!
- Great, now she won.

37:57.519 --> 38:01.548
What am I supposed to do?
She's forgotten everything.

38:01.625 --> 38:04.693
I can't talk to her about her
memories because I don't know her.

38:04.752 --> 38:07.939
It's like she's not
even here. It's a joke.

38:08.026 --> 38:10.959
It's like there's no difference
between being dead and alive.

38:12.424 --> 38:13.357
I need a drink.

38:16.146 --> 38:17.974
Yeah, I can't let him drink alone.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.993
Well, don't worry about me.

38:28.116 --> 38:28.823
What?

38:29.872 --> 38:30.912
What do you want?

38:31.009 --> 38:31.624
The post-it?

38:35.152 --> 38:35.694
Beth.

38:36.754 --> 38:37.640
My daughter, Beth.

38:47.217 --> 38:49.338
Do you want to hear a story, Nina?

38:49.452 --> 38:50.635
Oh, I love stories.

38:52.879 --> 38:55.930
Well, once, there was
a girl named George.

38:56.708 --> 38:58.475
She was 18 years old,

38:59.236 --> 39:01.731
and she didn't have a husband William,

39:02.166 --> 39:04.213
she didn't have a daughter named Beth,

39:05.136 --> 39:08.417
but she had a mom, a
father, and a sister,

39:08.683 --> 39:10.706
and one day, she went outside.

39:10.768 --> 39:14.265
It was a sunny day, few
clouds, but an ordinary day,

39:15.866 --> 39:21.003
and she went out to get
some lunch, and this man...

39:22.548 --> 39:23.787
he stopped me,

39:25.538 --> 39:26.891
and he talked to me,

39:27.920 --> 39:29.757
and he knew my last name.

39:30.398 --> 39:32.113
I told him to leave me alone,

39:32.190 --> 39:35.835
but then something from the sky fell,

39:36.367 --> 39:37.786
and I didn't feel anything.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.579
I couldn't remember anything,

39:43.360 --> 39:44.841
at first,

39:45.701 --> 39:46.786
but then I did.

39:47.151 --> 39:50.627
I realized... I died.

39:58.542 --> 39:59.725
I...

40:01.267 --> 40:02.367
died.

40:06.150 --> 40:08.239
I'm dead.

40:33.621 --> 40:34.680
I'm dead.

40:36.006 --> 40:37.030
That's right.

40:38.443 --> 40:39.928
Yes. That's right.

40:42.744 --> 40:43.748
That's all right.

40:48.714 --> 40:49.462
Thank you.

40:51.187 --> 40:52.590
You're welcome, Nina.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.163
I didn't know Nina's story.

40:56.461 --> 40:57.762
I could only tell her mine.

40:58.461 --> 41:00.515
It was the only story I really knew.

41:07.985 --> 41:10.699
I guess death makes
everything grow cold.

41:11.816 --> 41:14.657
I hadn't been thinking
about Reggie at all lately,

41:15.071 --> 41:16.014
or my mom,

41:16.239 --> 41:17.077
or my dad.

41:17.744 --> 41:19.864
I hadn't been thinking
about them at all,

41:20.581 --> 41:22.547
and I bet they weren't
thinking about me.

41:26.083 --> 41:29.522
Either way, my afterlife was a secret.

41:32.542 --> 41:35.403
Anything else was just too dangerous.

41:36.033 --> 41:38.354
My bonny lies over the ocean

41:38.701 --> 41:41.097
my bonny lies over the sea

41:41.594 --> 41:44.072
my bonny lies over the ocean...

41:44.272 --> 41:47.420
so bring back my bonny to me

41:51.106 --> 41:52.781
We were just getting
home from the hospital.

41:53.416 --> 41:54.870
I didn't ask you where you were.

41:55.108 --> 41:56.247
What are you doing here, Ray?

41:56.314 --> 41:58.634
Waiting for you. Well, not you,

41:59.611 --> 42:01.859
not you, but you.

42:02.577 --> 42:04.424
You left the gym without saying goodbye.

42:04.547 --> 42:05.325
I'm sorry.

42:06.590 --> 42:07.394
Goodbye.

42:10.680 --> 42:11.977
I think you should piss off.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.999
I think you should stay
out of this, Ginger.

42:15.248 --> 42:16.772
Somebody die at the hospital?

42:17.373 --> 42:18.009
No.

42:18.156 --> 42:19.754
Somebody died at the gym today,

42:20.399 --> 42:23.261
but then, you knew that,

42:23.626 --> 42:24.932
and the night we met,

42:25.263 --> 42:26.829
and two days ago.

42:28.888 --> 42:32.021
I'm beginning to think
that you're bad luck.

42:32.170 --> 42:32.964
Yeah.

42:33.532 --> 42:34.265
I am.

42:34.500 --> 42:35.244
Yeah.

42:36.229 --> 42:39.061
That's what your friend
Rube told me this morning.

42:39.159 --> 42:41.708
- You met
Rube? - Mm-hmm.

42:42.814 --> 42:44.238
He wasn't very nice to me.

42:44.965 --> 42:48.877
Then again, none of you
has been very nice to me.

42:49.174 --> 42:50.371
You really should leave now.

42:53.521 --> 42:54.432
Okay.

42:56.010 --> 42:56.868
I'll go.

42:57.355 --> 42:59.132
And don't come back. I'm done with you.

42:59.885 --> 43:00.893
Good for you.

43:02.255 --> 43:03.632
I think you're right to end it.

43:11.465 --> 43:12.731
Just one thing, sweetie.

43:13.319 --> 43:15.562
You don't end things. I end them.

43:15.814 --> 43:18.307
You don't tell me you're done. I do.

43:18.982 --> 43:20.354
You're worse than bad luck.

43:20.462 --> 43:21.942
You're a black fucking hole.

43:22.495 --> 43:23.269
Fuck you.

43:24.506 --> 43:26.536
You're not as genteel
as you look, Daisy.

43:26.951 --> 43:28.414
In fact, as pretty as you are,

43:28.701 --> 43:30.309
I just can't shake the feeling

43:30.447 --> 43:33.812
that you're really just a
cheap hillbilly piece of tail.

43:52.033 --> 43:53.072
He's dead.

43:53.344 --> 43:54.071
He's dead?

43:54.842 --> 43:56.697
I... I...

44:03.540 --> 44:05.151
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

44:09.181 --> 44:09.855
There's...

44:10.957 --> 44:12.544
there's no post-it.

44:14.189 --> 44:15.729
And there's no fucking soul.

44:16.113 --> 44:17.623
Fucking...

44:19.650 --> 44:20.945
Is there a shovel in here?

44:21.634 --> 44:24.172
There's got to be a shovel,
hasn't there? Is there?

44:48.501 --> 44:51.277
This is all my fault. This
is all my fucking fault.

44:51.344 --> 44:52.280
It's my fault. It's my fault.

44:52.373 --> 44:54.341
It's not your fault, and you're
in it now. You're in it now.

44:54.404 --> 44:56.025
- Stop it.
- You are in it now.

44:56.192 --> 44:57.539
It's nobody's fault.

45:00.263 --> 45:01.539
Uh, and it's done.

45:02.331 --> 45:03.473
- All right?
- Yeah.

45:04.217 --> 45:05.568
We keep this to ourselves,

45:06.270 --> 45:07.692
and no one needs to know.

45:09.592 --> 45:11.040
What the fuck was that?

45:11.840 --> 45:14.455
How the fuck did you know that was
going to happen, that graveling?

45:14.753 --> 45:16.032
Because I've seen it before,

45:17.518 --> 45:19.166
and he was right. I'm bad luck.

45:22.818 --> 45:25.645
There are things inside you
that no one wants to face,

45:27.497 --> 45:31.102
things that you keep
secret, even from yourself...

45:32.013 --> 45:33.850
but secrets are funny.

45:34.666 --> 45:38.973
The things that you try to hide always
turn out to be the things you can't forget.
