<i> Previously on</i> Empire...
Empire Entertainment has filed

00:03.170 --> 00:05.371
to become a publicly
traded company.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.973
HAKEEM:<i> Come on, Jamal,</i>
<i> I need your help.</i>

00:07.975 --> 00:09.041
I don't care.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.042
How long did you think that

00:10.044 --> 00:11.377
I would just let you use me?

00:11.379 --> 00:13.145
There's no special
girl in your life?

00:13.147 --> 00:15.347
No one special.
For someone who's bipolar,

00:15.349 --> 00:17.850
canceling a doctor's appointment
is life-threatening.

00:17.852 --> 00:19.551
No!
Give it back!

00:19.553 --> 00:20.719
I am fighting for
a comeback, too, Elle.

00:20.721 --> 00:23.322
It is do or die
for me, too.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.791
I'm Malcolm DeVeaux,
Empire's new head of security.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.960
I feel safer already,
Mr. DeVeaux.

00:27.962 --> 00:30.329
How long I got?
Three years.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.731
Dr. Mason, how do we know
that this is gonna be safe?

00:32.733 --> 00:33.966
It's an experimental drug.

00:33.968 --> 00:36.035
But...
I am dead without it.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.836
What's up, Olivia?
What are you doing here?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.538
OLIVIA:
She wanted to meet her daddy.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.876
♪ ♪

00:48.515 --> 00:50.983
LUCIOUS: <i> This investor showcase
is make or break for us, Vernon.</i>

00:50.985 --> 00:52.584
<i> I mean, nothing can go wrong.</i>

00:52.586 --> 00:54.586
Eric.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.555
We need more technology.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.891
I mean, serious holograms.
Okay, boss.

01:00.727 --> 01:02.828
Also got word that, um,

01:02.830 --> 01:05.431
Olivia, the baby mama?

01:05.433 --> 01:06.832
No, his ex-wife.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.233
Whatever you want
to call her-- anyway,

01:08.235 --> 01:09.868
she's been down in
St. Louis since '09,

01:09.870 --> 01:12.704
working as a hairdresser,
never got remarried...

01:12.706 --> 01:14.440
That girl is
a problem, Lucious.

01:14.442 --> 01:17.009
You did this to Jamal.
Now, what does she want?

01:17.011 --> 01:18.877
She wants a father for
her kid is what she said.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.113
Anyway, she's working
as a hairdresser.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.782
Living with some dude who
put his hands on her,

01:23.784 --> 01:25.717
so she got an order of
protection against him,

01:25.719 --> 01:27.719
the police, all that
nonsense, you know?

01:27.721 --> 01:29.721
How could you make
your son marry that girl?

01:29.723 --> 01:31.890
How could you
force him to do that?

01:31.892 --> 01:33.392
He was 18; a baby.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.761
Now, she's claiming
she has his baby.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.362
Well, how do you know
it's not his baby?

01:37.364 --> 01:40.065
You got to have sex
to make a baby, Lucious.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.934
Come on.

01:41.936 --> 01:43.936
VERNON:
Either way,

01:43.938 --> 01:45.637
we still gonna have
to deal with it.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.573
One way or another.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.109
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.578
I just got off
with MKTO's managers.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.613
They would have to cut
the South American tour short

01:54.615 --> 01:56.615
in order to make the showcase,
so they want a promo contest

01:56.617 --> 01:58.784
to send out 100 of
their Brazilian fans.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.220
No, this is
for prospective investors only.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.455
Malcolm says it's
a huge security risk.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.757
And no fans, no press.

02:05.759 --> 02:08.727
We still got
a problem, Lucious.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.396
Hi! Marvin Menchel is...

02:11.398 --> 02:12.931
Are you okay?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.633
We need to go over the budget
for the showcase.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.235
The bank has only...

02:16.237 --> 02:17.603
You can't keep
avoiding this!

02:17.605 --> 02:18.804
ANDRE: Fantastic.
Thank you. Okay, bye.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.405
Dad, we are on for dinner.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.774
What's... tell me
about this guy.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.276
Uh, Terry Schiller, late 60s,

02:24.278 --> 02:25.911
manages one of the biggest funds
in the country.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.012
Billions at his fingertips.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.413
So, an early commitment

02:28.415 --> 02:29.781
from him would mean what?

02:29.783 --> 02:31.250
A huge boost
in the company's valuation.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.417
You all right?

02:33.586 --> 02:36.088
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, okay.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.256
We need to get him to
the showcase, Dad.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.657
The way to appeal to him is

02:38.659 --> 02:40.692
through family--
he's a real family guy, right?

02:40.694 --> 02:42.694
The reason he's coming
to dinner with us tonight

02:42.696 --> 02:44.296
is because his daughter roomed
with Rhonda at Wharton.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.664
Well, Empire is family.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.132
I mean, that's
what we're selling.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.800
Family is the whole showcase.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.836
Then like I said, Lucious,
you got a problem.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.372
Jamal and Hakeem--
they can't stand to be

02:53.374 --> 02:55.641
in the same room together,
let alone on the same stage.

02:55.643 --> 02:58.443
Look... (chuckles) this beef
they got between each other,

02:58.445 --> 02:59.778
it ain't dying.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.213
I'll meet you at La Banana Noire.
Okay.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.382
8:00?
Yeah.

03:04.717 --> 03:07.553
And on top of that,
Jamal is going damn crazy.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.021
(muffled): Why would
you make him marry

03:09.023 --> 03:10.822
some stupid-ass backup singer?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.824
Now we got to deal
with her baby mama...

03:12.826 --> 03:14.760
Enough, Cookie!

03:24.637 --> 03:27.873
(siren wailing,
EMT speaks indistinctly)

03:27.875 --> 03:29.508
ANIKA (muffled):
Lucious, can you hear me?

03:29.510 --> 03:31.476
(muffled voices
speaking over each other)

03:31.478 --> 03:32.844
Lucious, come on,
we're gonna get you

03:32.846 --> 03:34.646
to the hospital
as soon as possible.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.648
Are you okay, Lucious?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.016
Lucious!

03:38.018 --> 03:39.218
MAN:
How long has he been out?

03:39.220 --> 03:41.853
When did he last eat?

03:41.855 --> 03:43.422
Has he lost
consciousness before?

03:43.424 --> 03:45.991
(indistinct chatter)

03:46.893 --> 03:48.827
Shh...
W-Watch it, watch it.

03:48.829 --> 03:52.097
(Anika speaking,
muffled and indistinct)

03:52.099 --> 03:54.266
(EMTs speaking,
muffled and indistinct)

03:54.268 --> 03:56.168
Be careful!
All right, we're good.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.373
What are you doing?
I'm his wife.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.609
Ex-wife.
She's his soon-to-be ex-wife.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.844
I just need to know
who's gonna ride with him.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.686
Thank you.
Come on. We'll take a cab.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.088
EMT: Here we go.
Let's go, guys.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.256
(Lucious mutters weakly)

04:24.364 --> 04:26.765
Michael, why are you
doing all of this?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.600
Because this is
what you want, Jamal.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.135
Couldn't even tell it
to my face.

04:30.137 --> 04:33.038
I had to hear it on the radio:
"Nobody special"?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.139
I said no special girl.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.741
Yeah, and how do you think

04:35.743 --> 04:36.975
that made me feel, huh?

04:36.977 --> 04:38.076
Listening to you say that

04:38.078 --> 04:40.145
in front of the whole world!

04:40.147 --> 04:43.215
Well, now you do have a
special girl in your life.

04:43.217 --> 04:44.716
A daughter.

04:47.253 --> 04:50.622
It's better to end this
now before I have to...

04:50.624 --> 04:52.557
walk out on you and a kid.

04:52.559 --> 04:53.592
The kid can't be mine.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.826
I slept with that girl once.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.728
Well, once is all it takes.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.463
Oh,<i> príncipe, </i>
you know that I love...

04:58.465 --> 04:59.898
No, don't call me that!

04:59.900 --> 05:01.099
You don't love me.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.802
I love you.

05:05.405 --> 05:08.240
But you're in love
with your music.

05:08.242 --> 05:11.343
You don't have room
for anyone else.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.079
(engine starts)

05:16.149 --> 05:18.050
(door closes)

05:24.157 --> 05:25.524
I'll never forget the first time

05:25.526 --> 05:27.092
Sarah brought you
for Thanksgiving.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.860
I was so nervous
I couldn't even eat.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.529
I mean, your home

05:30.531 --> 05:31.930
is so beautiful. Oh, my God.
Hold on, Dad.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.433
Hold on one second
while I fill him in, okay?

05:34.435 --> 05:36.134
Mr. Schiller, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.103
My father's jet had
to make an emergency

05:38.105 --> 05:39.204
landing in Baltimore.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.305
One of the engines caught fire.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.273
Now, he's okay, but he just,

05:41.275 --> 05:42.341
he feels terrible.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.542
He'd like to speak with you.

05:45.044 --> 05:48.180
LUCIOUS (over phone):
Hey, Terry... sorry.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.614
I can't tell you, man.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.516
You know,
these damn planes.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.151
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.854
And I'm delighted
to spend the evening with your

05:55.856 --> 05:57.789
charming son
and his beautiful wife.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.991
And I'll hear them out,
Lucious.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.893
But frankly,
as I told Andre in advance,

06:01.895 --> 06:03.829
the Schiller Fund
has never been drawn

06:03.831 --> 06:05.464
to entertainment companies.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.832
They're too volatile.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.067
Terry, even if you decide
not to invest,

06:09.069 --> 06:10.736
come and enjoy the concert.
I promise you

06:10.738 --> 06:13.038
you will not see another one
like it for a while.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.973
All right.
All right. Later.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.241
(groans):
Oh, my...

06:16.243 --> 06:17.976
You okay? Nurse! Nurse!
I'm here.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.045
Thank you, sir.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.713
Sir, please turn over.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.048
It's all for you, bae.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.683
Your own personal
private chef Roblé.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.551
Enjoy it.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.720
"Bae"? What is a "bae"?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.322
It means "babe."

06:31.991 --> 06:33.759
Bro...

06:33.761 --> 06:35.727
seems like the lady's
on a completely

06:35.729 --> 06:37.529
different date than
you are, but, uh,

06:37.531 --> 06:40.065
if that chicken right there
doesn't turn that around,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.500
I don't know what will.

06:45.938 --> 06:48.073
This is for you.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.875
What is it?

06:49.877 --> 06:51.610
Open it.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.514
(chuckles)

07:01.087 --> 07:03.622
What?
You got to be joking.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.190
You want to brand me
with your name,

07:05.192 --> 07:07.426
but you don't want
to take me out in public?

07:07.428 --> 07:08.960
(shuts box)

07:08.962 --> 07:11.463
I'm not your
backstreet slut, Hakeem.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.732
Treat me like
you treat that girl.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.367
Why you keep
talking about Tiana?

07:15.369 --> 07:17.903
You know she wasn't
nothing to me.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.571
It was for record
sales and buzz.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.106
That's what you got
to do in my position.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.140
Just tell me...

07:22.142 --> 07:24.543
Just tell me what you want,

07:24.545 --> 07:26.278
and I'll do anything.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.081
When are you performing next?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.716
Baby, I can't.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.318
It's a private thing
for money folks.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.520
IPO investors
gonna be there.

07:38.925 --> 07:42.127
How about I just put
you on the VIP list,

07:42.129 --> 07:43.762
as a private investor?

07:43.764 --> 07:47.999
So you mean, like, incognito?

07:48.001 --> 07:51.069
Yeah. I mean, we keep it
on the DL this time.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.938
Next time,
it's me and you.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.041
Arm in arm, promise.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.377
Come on.

08:06.619 --> 08:07.752
(door opens)

08:07.754 --> 08:08.787
Hi, Doctor.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.256
Thank you for coming.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.591
What the hell is she doing here?

08:12.593 --> 08:13.959
Where's Dr. Mason?

08:13.961 --> 08:14.960
I called Dr. Shahani.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.695
I want Dr. Mason here!

08:16.697 --> 08:17.963
Luther Mason...
(scoffs)

08:17.965 --> 08:19.631
I can't even call him "Doctor"--

08:19.633 --> 08:21.800
had his license revoked

08:21.802 --> 08:23.101
two years ago for doing
to another patient

08:23.103 --> 08:24.269
what he's now doing to you.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.271
He's saving my life.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.772
Sadly, the opposite is true.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.608
Your ALT and your AST levels
are elevated,

08:29.610 --> 08:31.209
and you're in the early stages
of liver damage.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.311
These aren't
symptoms of ALS.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.380
That charlatan's drugs
are doing this.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.182
I'm getting better.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.284
It's a breakthrough treatment
they've got in Russia.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.385
They're so far ahead.

08:40.387 --> 08:41.853
The FDA is
behind the curve.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.723
Okay, well, this Russian
so-called breakthrough

08:44.725 --> 08:46.191
is killing you faster

08:46.193 --> 08:48.026
than your disease is,
Lucious.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.295
It's poison.
Do you understand?

08:50.297 --> 08:52.230
There is no cure for ALS.
Get out of here!

08:52.232 --> 08:54.866
And anyone who tries
to tell you that there is--

08:54.868 --> 08:57.202
and takes your money while
they're at it-- is a criminal.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.570
Really, do you understand?

08:58.572 --> 09:00.105
Get the hell out of here!

09:03.309 --> 09:04.643
What's going on in there?

09:04.645 --> 09:05.810
Are you family?

09:05.812 --> 09:07.145
I used to be married to the man.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.580
I gave him three sons.

09:08.582 --> 09:10.181
That should be family enough.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.616
I'm sorry I can't let you in.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.901
(groaning)

09:35.908 --> 09:38.610
Let's hear from Empire Sports Management
Division. Empire Elite Sports rules.

09:38.612 --> 09:41.079
We rep six
first-round NBA picks.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.714
Endorsement deals
have brought in

09:42.716 --> 09:44.249
well over $32 million...

09:44.251 --> 09:46.351
Impressive.
We'll lead with that.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.887
Sports is an investor favorite,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.122
Gets the crowd
revved up and energized.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.259
LUCIOUS:
No, we will lead with music.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.595
Empire begins and ends
with music.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.029
Never forget that.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.632
This presentation's
about money, Dad.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.934
Men like Schiller want
to hear the numbers.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.569
No, music is
what's going to get them

10:04.571 --> 10:06.738
to invest their millions
in this company.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.872
Music is emotional.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.075
Music is what Empire is about.

10:10.077 --> 10:13.612
I want to hear the music lineup.

10:13.614 --> 10:14.813
Lovely.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.147
All right.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.983
We have multiple acts
that we will be doing

10:17.985 --> 10:20.485
for the pre-show
cocktail party.

10:20.487 --> 10:21.786
And then Hakeem and Jamal

10:21.788 --> 10:24.055
are gonna be opening
on the main stage.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.291
No, no, no, no, no.
I want to open

10:26.293 --> 10:28.960
with Elle Dallas--
she was Empire's first

10:28.962 --> 10:31.730
platinum-selling artist
after me.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.966
She'll have a sentimental appeal
to this money crowd.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.901
I would love
to have Elle, Lucious,

10:36.903 --> 10:38.269
but she's an addict.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.904
Well, Cookie says
she's in good shape.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.306
I trust Cookie on this.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.440
Fine.

12:11.497 --> 12:15.233

out of bed?

12:15.235 --> 12:16.835
It was just food poisoning.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.603
"Food poisoning," huh?

12:18.605 --> 12:20.839

Lucious, save your
little sad songs.

What?
I just need time to think.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.965
No, let him go.
He needs to blow off some steam.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.713
And you have
written this thing,

29:42.715 --> 29:44.648
but I need someone that can
go and excite these people.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.116
Cookie...
Hmm?

29:46.118 --> 29:48.452
I need you to go out
there and remind them

29:48.454 --> 29:50.721
that Empire is a
family business

29:50.723 --> 29:52.289
built for<i> our</i> sons.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.125
(pants) And it is gonna
pass from one generation

29:55.127 --> 29:56.760
to the next generation.

29:56.762 --> 29:58.729
It's gonna stay
in the family. Please.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.300
(panting)

30:03.302 --> 30:05.402
Okay.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.982
(crowd murmuring)

30:18.984 --> 30:21.919
I'm gonna sue
that Dr. Mason.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.188
(weakly):
It's not the drugs.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.489
What?

30:25.491 --> 30:28.025
It's not the drugs,
it's ALS.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.993
It's-it's... Wait a minute,
take your time, baby.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.162
It's not the drugs
that did this to you?

30:32.164 --> 30:34.832
It's like a tremor with
my hands; it will...

30:34.834 --> 30:36.266
(clears throat)
...pass.

30:36.268 --> 30:39.169
It'll... it'll pass.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.607
Where's Lucious?

30:43.609 --> 30:45.843
(clears throat softly)

30:45.845 --> 30:47.644
Ladies and gentlemen...

30:47.646 --> 30:50.647
(sighs)

30:50.649 --> 30:53.083
Uh...

30:55.320 --> 30:57.654
Child, I ain't readin'...

30:57.656 --> 30:59.523
Just read the
teleprompter, Mom.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.892
My name is Cookie Lyon.

31:03.228 --> 31:07.297
My ex-husband, Lucious,
and I started this company

31:07.299 --> 31:09.199
in a little garage

31:09.201 --> 31:12.669
in one of the worst ghettos
in West Philadelphia.

31:12.671 --> 31:14.571
Yeah.

31:14.573 --> 31:17.841
Some of y'all probably have
a few ex-wives, so...

31:17.843 --> 31:20.010
(laughter)
...so you know I'm not gonna be

31:20.012 --> 31:22.980
standing up here, telling you
all this mushy stuff

31:22.982 --> 31:25.549
about what a fine man my ex is.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.551
(laughter) What the
hell's she doing?

31:27.553 --> 31:29.887
Lucious Lyon...

31:29.889 --> 31:32.589
is a musical god.

31:32.591 --> 31:36.860
And he's also a crazy
son of a bitch that had a dream.

31:36.862 --> 31:38.528
(laughter)

31:38.530 --> 31:40.197
Still has a dream--

31:40.199 --> 31:41.765
and nobody better ever try

31:41.767 --> 31:44.401
to get in between
Lucious and his dreams.

31:46.104 --> 31:48.038
We were hustlers.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.007
Hmm. Only choice we had.

31:50.009 --> 31:53.877
But... do you know what
the first rule of hustling is?

31:53.879 --> 31:56.113
MAN:
Supply and demand.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.848
(laughter)
Hey, who said that?

31:57.850 --> 31:59.850
COOKIE:
That's right, baby.

31:59.852 --> 32:01.885
Smart man.

32:01.887 --> 32:04.955
That's right-- you create
your own customer base.

32:04.957 --> 32:07.958
Give them some of
that good stuff.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.427
Make 'em want more.

32:10.429 --> 32:14.197
You see, Lucious did that
with music.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.967
He created... a sound.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.902
They call it
"the Lucious Lyon sound."

32:18.904 --> 32:21.104
You all know it,
or else you wouldn't be here.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.572
(laughter)

32:22.574 --> 32:24.875
Lucious's music took the street

32:24.877 --> 32:27.311
mainstream, and made
the mainstream feel street.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.613
Everything Lucious touches

32:29.615 --> 32:32.316
turns to platinum,
and that's a fact.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.718
He started out doing it
with the music.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.386
Next, he did it

32:36.388 --> 32:39.056
with over a dozen
profitable entertainment

32:39.058 --> 32:41.325
<i> and</i> merchandise divisions.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.160
And now...

32:43.162 --> 32:45.729
he's gonna do it
with your money...

32:45.731 --> 32:48.999
if you're lucky enough
and smart enough

32:49.001 --> 32:50.300
to put it in his hands.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.269
(scattered laughter)

32:52.271 --> 32:54.338
(chuckles)

32:56.007 --> 32:59.810
Lucious and I had three sons,
before he dumped me.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.345
(laughter)

33:01.347 --> 33:03.747
Our oldest son Andre

33:03.749 --> 33:06.917
is the CFO of this company.

33:06.919 --> 33:08.685
He's brilliant,

33:08.687 --> 33:12.255
and he's gonna make every
last one of you filthy rich.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.491
(murmurs of affirmation)

33:15.960 --> 33:19.196
Our other two sons,
Jamal and Hakeem Lyon...

33:19.198 --> 33:22.432
(crowd cheers)
they are living proof...

33:22.434 --> 33:26.536
that Empire is more
than just one man's dream.

33:26.538 --> 33:29.172
It's a dream come true

33:29.174 --> 33:32.843
that's ready to be passed down
to the next generation,

33:32.845 --> 33:35.479
and the next and the next.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.014
And you all...

33:37.016 --> 33:39.449
can be a part of it.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.951
(crowd cheering)

33:50.495 --> 33:53.463
Thank you.

33:53.465 --> 33:56.633
I love you, Cookie.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.268
(exhales)

34:00.038 --> 34:01.905
Very impressive, Lucious.

34:01.907 --> 34:04.541
Especially that story
that your ex-wife told.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.877
(groans): Oh. What
really sold me though

34:06.879 --> 34:10.981
is your family and how devoted
each and every one of them is

34:10.983 --> 34:13.283
to the future
of this company.

34:15.153 --> 34:18.055
Thank you so much, Terry.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.826
Oh, baby...
Are you sure

34:22.828 --> 34:25.228
you don't want me to cancel
my trip to Chicago?

34:25.230 --> 34:26.396
Lana's gonna understand.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.864
No, don't cancel.
I mean,

34:27.866 --> 34:29.266
whatever that is,
it's gone now.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.734
I'm, like...
I'm a hundred percent.

34:30.736 --> 34:33.370
Look, and you need
to hammer out the new details

34:33.372 --> 34:35.038
of that contract for her.
Don't forget,

34:35.040 --> 34:37.174
her lawyer's gonna be
on the plane, too, okay?

34:37.176 --> 34:40.210
All right. Well, you better
call me if something goes down.

34:40.212 --> 34:41.445
You call me
when you get there.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.913
Don't tell me
what to do.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.048
I love you. (laughs):
I love you too.

34:45.050 --> 34:46.583
Come on.

34:57.728 --> 34:59.563
Where's she going?

34:59.565 --> 35:01.631
She has to go up
to Chicago overnight,

35:01.633 --> 35:03.934
take care of something
with Lana Del Rey.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.640
Are you gonna tell me what's
going on with you, or what?

35:12.777 --> 35:14.377
Yeah.

35:18.616 --> 35:21.651
Lola, say good night to
Uncle Andre and Aunt Rhonda.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.386
Aw, good night, baby.
Pretty.

35:23.388 --> 35:24.754
(laughs): Thank you. Good night.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.057
Don't forget about
your Uncle Hakeem.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.259
Pretty.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.661
Well, she got taste.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.597
(growls) Give me that, give me that.
Stop, stop.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.298
You're gonna
scare her. Stop.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.766
I'm gonna
call you back.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.768
Come here.
My brother's stupid.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.403
Mom, here.
Oh. Okay.

35:40.405 --> 35:42.572
I don't know
how to do all this.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.976
Don't worry, sweetie,
he'll get the hang of it.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.644
MALCOLM: I'll get back
to you with a proposal.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.579
In the meantime,
I'll be standing by.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.148
What are you two scheming up?

35:51.150 --> 35:53.016
Oh, we're talking about
the new security system

35:53.018 --> 35:54.251
we're having installed.

35:54.253 --> 35:56.786
Kevlar-lined walls,
infrared cameras,

35:56.788 --> 35:58.488
a bunker...

35:58.490 --> 36:00.023
Place is gonna be
an impenetrable fortress.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.791
You know, Mr. DeVeaux,
I was thinking

36:01.793 --> 36:04.995
maybe I need to... beef up
the security at my place,

36:04.997 --> 36:06.730
because, you know, I live alone.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.804
Sir, I'll get those numbers
and get back to you.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.207
You should call me
so we can set that up.

36:17.209 --> 36:18.775
You realize...

36:18.777 --> 36:20.010
Shut up, Lucious.

36:21.812 --> 36:23.547
Juanita, take the
baby upstairs.

36:23.549 --> 36:24.848
Yes, sir.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.750
Excuse me.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.686
Hakeem.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.555
Have a seat.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.824
Hold up.

36:34.826 --> 36:38.495
Mm! My little gangsta.

36:38.497 --> 36:40.797
(laughs)

36:44.335 --> 36:46.636
(sighs)

36:47.471 --> 36:49.406
I'm sick.

36:49.408 --> 36:51.641
Wait, what-what
do you mean?

36:51.643 --> 36:54.211
I have ALS.

36:54.213 --> 36:56.880
Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.381
It is a...

36:58.383 --> 37:00.150
(sighs)

37:00.152 --> 37:01.818
...an aggressive

37:01.820 --> 37:03.687
and degenerative

37:03.689 --> 37:05.589
neuromuscular disorder

37:05.591 --> 37:10.093
that will eventually take away
my ability to control...

37:10.095 --> 37:11.695
my body.

37:11.697 --> 37:14.898
What happened tonight
is, uh...

37:14.900 --> 37:18.268
it means the symptoms
are getting worse.

37:20.037 --> 37:21.905
It's fatal. There's no cure.

37:25.343 --> 37:27.444
Then why are we even doing this?

37:27.446 --> 37:29.246
That monster show
we put on today.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.213
That was

37:30.215 --> 37:32.048
my legacy for you.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.684
I mean, that's why I've been
pushing y'all so hard.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.287
I was so proud of
y'all tonight.

37:37.289 --> 37:40.790
Who knows this? Hmm?

37:40.792 --> 37:42.092
Vernon,

37:42.094 --> 37:43.426
Becky...

37:43.428 --> 37:46.263
and, uh, Anika, of course.

37:46.265 --> 37:48.932
Well, the IPO-- we...
we have to have a plan.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.368
He's dying and you're
worrying about a IPO?

37:51.370 --> 37:53.770
Yo, I should knock you...
Hakeem! Hakeem!

37:53.772 --> 37:55.372
What's wrong with you?!
What's up?!

37:55.374 --> 37:56.906
Andre! Andre!
Beat your little ass!

37:56.908 --> 37:58.808
Come on!
Stop! Sit down!

37:58.810 --> 38:01.311
He<i> should</i> be upset.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.383
Come on, baby, we got to go home.
(muttering) I don't know what to do.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.218
Andre, Andre, look at me. What?!

38:08.220 --> 38:09.853
I don't need your help!

38:14.625 --> 38:16.960
I'm sorry, Lucious.

38:21.799 --> 38:24.134
It's not what
I wanted, son.

38:26.437 --> 38:27.937
Ma...

38:27.939 --> 38:30.740
LUCIOUS: Boys, come on,
let's talk for a minute.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.353
Y'all have been through a lot.

38:45.122 --> 38:48.258
But y'all are gonna get
through this, whatever happens.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.295
Right now, I need y'all
to be strong.

38:52.297 --> 38:54.964
We will, Dad.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.567
Just tell us
what you need.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.940
Your mama didn't take this well.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.142
I need a moment with her, okay?

39:06.144 --> 39:08.545
Y'all go on home, okay?

39:17.621 --> 39:19.789
(shower running)

39:33.871 --> 39:35.538
Andre.

39:39.143 --> 39:40.877
Baby, what are you doing?

39:40.879 --> 39:42.312
Baby?

39:42.314 --> 39:43.646
Andre, what's wrong?

39:43.648 --> 39:44.981
(gasping)

39:44.983 --> 39:45.982
Baby, stop.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.817
Look at me.

39:47.819 --> 39:49.986
Baby... stop...
breathe...

39:49.988 --> 39:51.588
(gasping loudly)

39:51.590 --> 39:53.056
Stop...

39:53.058 --> 39:54.657
(breathing slows)

39:54.659 --> 39:56.226
Look at me.

39:56.228 --> 39:58.561
You're gonna run
this company.

39:58.563 --> 40:02.399
You're gonna have everything
you've ever worked for, okay?

40:05.369 --> 40:07.437
Look at me.

40:11.876 --> 40:13.943
Remember this?

40:13.945 --> 40:15.612
(mellow acoustic guitar
music playing)

40:15.614 --> 40:16.846
(chuckles softly)

40:24.955 --> 40:27.090
You said some really,
really nice things

40:27.092 --> 40:28.758
about me up
there tonight.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.527
♪ Sometimes you feel insecure ♪

40:30.529 --> 40:32.228
Kind of made
me feel good.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.731
Especially hearing
that from you.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.100
Why are you acting
so surprised?

40:37.102 --> 40:38.968
Because, I don't know...

40:38.970 --> 40:41.771
I just feel
like I owe you.

40:43.307 --> 40:46.743
Why do you have to
owe me, Lucious?

40:46.745 --> 40:49.712
This was my dream,
too, remember?

40:49.714 --> 40:52.415
Yeah. But, I mean, you...

40:52.417 --> 40:55.552
saw this... way before I did.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.388
Ain't even had my
first single, you said

40:58.390 --> 41:01.391
we're about to change the
music business forever...

41:01.393 --> 41:02.959
baby.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.494
(laughs)

41:04.496 --> 41:06.896
And that's because
I know you.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.466
I know what you're capable of.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.734
(soft, trembling breath)

41:11.736 --> 41:14.571
(crying): That's why
you got to beat this, Lucious.
