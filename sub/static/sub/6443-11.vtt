00:22.140 --> 00:24.797
Hey, Clark.
What ya doin'?

00:24.852 --> 00:26.273
Hey, um,

00:26.363 --> 00:28.895
I'm just trying to figure out
some of this trig homework.

00:28.948 --> 00:32.256
What for? Don't you already
have a scholarship to Met U.?

00:32.326 --> 00:35.526
Yes, for football. But they're still
gonna be looking at my final GPA.

00:35.595 --> 00:37.635
Well, when you're done
playing with your protractor,

00:37.640 --> 00:40.198
there's a party
over at Katie's house.

00:40.777 --> 00:43.237
Her parents have a hot tub.

00:45.793 --> 00:47.705
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:50.727 --> 00:54.188
Thanks, but I still got
a lot of work to do.

00:56.485 --> 01:00.567
Okay. Well, why don't you
drop by later if you finish?

01:01.826 --> 01:03.405
See ya.

01:06.129 --> 01:07.597
Good bye Clark.

01:16.283 --> 01:18.687
She was cute.

01:19.915 --> 01:21.179
Which one?

01:21.220 --> 01:23.562
Both. Thinking of asking
one of them out?

01:23.611 --> 01:26.144
Yeah, so that I could ruin
it just when we're getting close

01:26.215 --> 01:28.342
by having to lie about who I really am?

01:28.399 --> 01:29.959
Just like I did with Lana?

01:29.998 --> 01:32.811
Clark, there is someone
out there for you.

01:32.869 --> 01:34.167
Who?

01:34.946 --> 01:38.258
Mom, a girl would have to be crazy
to get into a relationship with me.

01:48.633 --> 01:51.098
I can't believe you're thinking
about letting that psycho go.

01:51.149 --> 01:55.288
That is what generally happens
when a patient is cured.

02:02.131 --> 02:03.420
Alicia.

02:04.948 --> 02:06.654
It's time.

02:07.256 --> 02:09.627
You can go home now.

02:13.122 --> 02:18.122
<i><font color="#ff0000">Smallville</font>: "<font color="#ffd700">Unsafe</font>"</i>
Season 4 Episode 11

02:19.039 --> 02:21.539
Original Airdate Jan. 26, 2005

03:29.186 --> 03:33.793
So what's Smallville's star quarterback
doing up here alone on a Saturday night?

03:34.179 --> 03:35.660
Alicia.

03:36.626 --> 03:38.909
I'm kinda surprised
you remembered my name.

03:39.563 --> 03:41.543
How could I forget?

03:45.349 --> 03:46.966
You tried to kill me.

03:47.017 --> 03:48.498
And Lana.

03:51.583 --> 03:54.412
I'd ask how you escaped, but I
guess that's pretty obvious.

03:54.471 --> 03:56.152
I didn't escape.

03:56.367 --> 04:00.496
They let me out.
The doctors say I'm cured.

04:02.997 --> 04:06.226
You could've called,
instead of teleporting into my loft.

04:06.293 --> 04:09.398
Actually, I borrowed
my mom's car and I drove.

04:10.275 --> 04:13.120
It's a little something
my doctor came up with.

04:13.275 --> 04:16.926
Trace amounts of lead are
released into my bloodstream and

04:17.000 --> 04:19.673
keeps me from using my powers.

04:22.598 --> 04:24.661
I'm glad they think you're better.

04:26.999 --> 04:29.356
That doesn't change
what happened between us.

04:29.405 --> 04:31.268
I know that, Clark.

04:31.877 --> 04:36.219
I just wanted to tell you how sorry
I am for everything I put you through.

04:36.773 --> 04:40.455
You're the last person on earth
that I ever wanted to hurt.

04:45.300 --> 04:48.444
But you didn't
answer my question.

04:49.688 --> 04:53.065
Why are you up here alone
on a Saturday night?

04:56.743 --> 04:59.106
Maybe I prefer to be alone.

05:01.263 --> 05:03.409
Because of your secret?

05:05.977 --> 05:08.819
Don't worry.
I didn't tell anyone.

05:08.878 --> 05:11.772
I promised you that I wouldn't.

05:11.832 --> 05:12.830
Alicia...

05:12.870 --> 05:16.180
the whole time I was in Belle Reve,
just the thought

05:16.249 --> 05:18.878
that there was
someone out there like me,

05:19.101 --> 05:22.809
who knew what it was like
to be different,

05:23.994 --> 05:25.575
gave me hope.

05:27.060 --> 05:31.123
In my darkest moment,
you gave me hope, Clark.

05:42.355 --> 05:43.470
Bye.

05:54.243 --> 05:58.384
So they just let Alicia
teleport out of Belle Reve?

05:58.470 --> 06:01.698
They gave her some sort of lead bracelet
that stops her from using her powers.

06:01.765 --> 06:03.946
And she doesn't seem
as dangerous anymore.

06:04.060 --> 06:05.555
Well, her powers weren't
the only thing that made

06:05.580 --> 06:07.643
her dangerous, Clark.
She's obsessed with you.

06:07.705 --> 06:09.433
And she knows your secret.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.782
Which she kept for over a year.

06:12.353 --> 06:15.002
Whatever they did to her
in Belle Reve, maybe it worked.

06:15.057 --> 06:17.287
We know how much you
want to be with someone

06:17.359 --> 06:19.564
you don't have to
lie to, sweetheart. But...

06:19.610 --> 06:21.523
Alicia isn't the one.

06:22.016 --> 06:24.177
So, what should I do...
just wait for the next cute

06:24.247 --> 06:26.257
girl with special abilities
to knock on my door?

06:26.299 --> 06:28.845
Clark, you know what she did.

06:28.986 --> 06:31.166
Alicia needs to be in an institution.

06:31.211 --> 06:33.424
Then why'd they let her
out of Belle Reve?

06:35.464 --> 06:37.723
What if she really is better?

06:37.949 --> 06:40.012
And what if she isn't?

06:46.883 --> 06:50.125
Damn, I'm good.
All right, Alicia Baker.

06:50.490 --> 06:53.177
"Suffering from a histrionic
personality disorder, causing

06:53.240 --> 06:56.440
emotional instability, resulting
in psychotic episodes." Yeah,

06:56.625 --> 06:58.855
that's our girl.

07:02.585 --> 07:03.999
Who's that guy?

07:04.035 --> 07:07.236
It's Alicia's psychiatrist
Dr. William McBride.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.065
Yeah, I've heard of him.

07:09.102 --> 07:13.711
He graduated from Harvard in two years
with more degrees than a thermometer.

07:14.921 --> 07:16.851
What's he say about Alicia?

07:20.579 --> 07:21.860
Wow. Well,

07:21.964 --> 07:25.191
according to Dr. McBride,
Alicia really is cured.

07:28.313 --> 07:30.293
She was telling the truth.

07:36.374 --> 07:41.625
And that, I take it, is exactly
what our young Mr. Kent wanted to hear.

08:00.342 --> 08:02.100
What are you doing here?

08:03.341 --> 08:05.085
It's nice to see you, too.

08:05.122 --> 08:07.334
Sorry, I just didn't expect you
to show up on campus.

08:07.385 --> 08:09.713
Like I didn't expect you
to say that you needed space

08:09.770 --> 08:11.843
right before you
walked out on me?

08:14.273 --> 08:16.669
Jason, what's really going on here?

08:17.125 --> 08:20.324
Where this is heading with us,
I just don't think you're ready.

08:20.788 --> 08:23.367
I don't think you're ready
for a relationship like that.

08:23.492 --> 08:25.489
Relationship like what?

08:26.046 --> 08:28.994
Can we not talk about this right now?
I don't want...

08:29.560 --> 08:31.657
look, Lana, I have to go.

08:55.381 --> 08:59.145
Super powers can't
save you now, Clark Kent.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.785
No, I'm good.
I'm... I'm good.

09:01.978 --> 09:03.375
Okay, come on.

09:05.538 --> 09:07.219
Just relax your knees.

09:07.618 --> 09:09.332
Just glide.

09:11.294 --> 09:13.607
I'm really glad that you called me.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.168
I didn't think that you
would after what happened

09:16.218 --> 09:18.546
the last time we
went out on a date.

09:20.199 --> 09:23.427
Well, you were sick then.
I understand now.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.504
I don't.

09:27.205 --> 09:28.619
I mean,

09:28.672 --> 09:30.585
I remember feeling

09:31.045 --> 09:33.774
angry and alone and doing
all those things, but...

09:34.445 --> 09:37.206
I don't know... when I think
about it now, it's like...

09:37.263 --> 09:40.186
it's like watching a movie.
Like it wasn't even really me.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.293
Maybe it wasn't.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.795
Maybe this is the real you.

09:54.188 --> 09:57.349
Good thing you've got buns of steel.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.653
Oh...

10:06.253 --> 10:09.176
you might be impervious to the cold,

10:09.237 --> 10:12.032
but I'm turning into a Popsicle.

10:13.423 --> 10:16.075
Well, I do have heat vision.

10:16.130 --> 10:18.697
Well, I think I'd settle
for some hot chocolate.

10:18.750 --> 10:19.848
Okay.

10:20.185 --> 10:23.713
I'm just gonna go freshen up first.
I'll meet you over there.

10:23.786 --> 10:25.001
Okay.

10:37.072 --> 10:38.686
Enjoying your freedom?

10:38.720 --> 10:40.609
Dr. McBride.

10:40.649 --> 10:42.130
What are you doing here?

10:42.165 --> 10:44.947
Checking up on my favorite patient.

10:47.509 --> 10:50.610
This does more than just
keep you in place, Alicia.

10:50.674 --> 10:52.691
You lojacked me?

10:54.534 --> 10:56.813
I have to know where
you are, so that you

10:56.865 --> 11:00.104
don't do anything to
jeopardize your release...

11:00.881 --> 11:03.952
like associating with Clark Kent.

11:04.187 --> 11:07.015
What I do with Clark is my own business.

11:07.187 --> 11:10.502
Clark was the object of your obsession, Alicia.

11:10.586 --> 11:14.773
Your feelings for him are what
precipitated your psychotic break.

11:14.859 --> 11:18.386
You really want to risk
an incident like that again?

11:19.424 --> 11:21.806
But you said that I was better.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.484
And I want you to stay that way.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.652
Perhaps more sessions together

11:29.701 --> 11:32.846
outside of the office would be beneficial.

11:35.454 --> 11:38.549
You are such a bright,
beautiful young girl.

11:41.794 --> 11:45.038
It'd be a shame to see you
end up back in Belle Reve.

11:46.030 --> 11:50.040
Stop seeing Clark Kent
before someone gets hurt.

12:00.405 --> 12:02.890
There you are.
I thought I'd lost you.

12:02.942 --> 12:06.085
Oh, you're not getting rid of me that easily.

12:08.575 --> 12:10.446
Ooh, I let it get cold.

12:10.969 --> 12:12.566
Would you mind?

12:20.492 --> 12:21.866
Thank you.

12:27.443 --> 12:29.365
So, what do you want to do next?

12:29.405 --> 12:30.686
Um...

12:31.119 --> 12:32.969
You wanna go for a drive?

12:33.298 --> 12:36.010
Sure. Where do you want to go?

12:37.254 --> 12:39.533
Have you ever been to California?

12:39.727 --> 12:41.195
California.

12:44.659 --> 12:49.168
Sure, let's jump in the truck,
and we'll go to California right now.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.180
Are you serious?

12:58.493 --> 13:00.242
Alicia, going to
California would be...

13:00.285 --> 13:01.548
Crazy?

13:02.551 --> 13:03.972
I wasn't gonna say that.

13:04.002 --> 13:07.097
No, I know that it sounds crazy.
I just...

13:09.153 --> 13:14.627
I just want to go somewhere where
nobody knows me or what I did.

13:15.944 --> 13:17.907
And I want you to come with me.

13:22.378 --> 13:23.759
I can't.

13:25.757 --> 13:28.020
I mean, as much as I'd want to be with you...

13:32.191 --> 13:33.854
is everything okay?

13:38.669 --> 13:41.401
I actually have to go.

13:42.859 --> 13:45.455
I'll call you later.

15:20.026 --> 15:22.388
Well, the prodigal father returns.

15:23.075 --> 15:26.361
I've been trying to reach you,
but you're always somehow, uh...

15:26.512 --> 15:27.976
unavailable.

15:28.292 --> 15:31.586
Too busy playing with your sword
to speak to your father?

15:31.654 --> 15:34.998
Actually, I've been preoccupied
by your court papers...

15:35.067 --> 15:38.340
trying to unravel how you managed
to get your conviction overturned.

15:38.408 --> 15:41.831
Well, I don't think you'll find the answers
in that stack of legal documents.

15:41.902 --> 15:43.899
It was a, uh...

15:45.149 --> 15:48.011
A miracle.
There's no other way to explain it.

15:48.070 --> 15:53.178
And I must use that freedom
I was given towards a...

15:53.971 --> 15:55.937
a greater purpose.

15:57.601 --> 16:00.125
Well, I hope that
purpose doesn't include

16:00.187 --> 16:02.210
returning to
Luthorcorp, because

16:02.352 --> 16:05.113
you won't be walking through the
door to the executive suite

16:05.195 --> 16:07.924
or raiding the coffers to line
your pockets any time soon.

16:07.995 --> 16:09.215
I'm not here for money, Lex.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.385
I don't want to take
Luthorcorp away from you.

16:11.457 --> 16:14.782
Corporate maneuvering
doesn't interest anymore.

16:14.851 --> 16:18.408
So, what, now trying to kill me
is going to be a full-time job?

16:18.482 --> 16:21.582
I know... I know where
you're coming from, Lex.

16:21.646 --> 16:24.457
It's a place of anger and mistrust.

16:24.815 --> 16:27.630
But it's not too late. It's not.
There's still time

16:27.714 --> 16:30.504
to get off the path that
can only lead to darkness.

16:30.575 --> 16:32.077
Come on, dad.

16:32.271 --> 16:33.997
What are you really up to?

16:34.208 --> 16:37.372
I am trying to make the world a better place.

16:37.438 --> 16:41.301
I'm going to create
a charitable foundation, not just...

16:41.381 --> 16:44.255
to feed the hungry and clothe the poor.

16:44.315 --> 16:48.370
No, I want to really help people,
to inspire the human spirit.

16:48.454 --> 16:54.128
I wish everyone on the face of the earth
could be as blessed as I am.

17:00.482 --> 17:02.259
So now you're the messiah?

17:02.296 --> 17:03.493
No.

17:03.730 --> 17:05.976
Lex, no, I'm just... I'm...

17:07.482 --> 17:11.097
I'm a man who has a dream.

17:22.251 --> 17:24.608
Oh! Guess who?

17:24.656 --> 17:27.516
I was starting to think you were on your way
to California already.

17:27.575 --> 17:29.921
Well, my bags are in the car.

17:31.147 --> 17:33.144
What's going on?

17:33.685 --> 17:35.332
Uh...

17:36.768 --> 17:40.199
Dr. McBride, my psychiatrist...

17:40.530 --> 17:42.360
he was at the ice rink.

17:43.563 --> 17:48.406
He said that if I keep seeing you,
he's going to send me back to Belle Reve.

17:48.608 --> 17:50.455
Why would he do that?

17:51.460 --> 17:54.006
Maybe because he's jealous.

17:54.246 --> 17:58.867
I think, in his mind, he thought
that if I was out, he could be with me.

17:59.049 --> 18:01.890
Well, go to the review board at Belle Reve,
and tell them about McBride.

18:01.910 --> 18:04.788
Well, I can't risk them revoking my probation.

18:04.848 --> 18:07.111
What do you think they're gonna do if you run?

18:09.743 --> 18:12.858
As long as I'm free, I don't care.

18:15.923 --> 18:18.398
Come with me, Clark.

18:20.753 --> 18:22.866
I want to...

18:22.912 --> 18:26.722
but running's not the answer.
Trust me, I know.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.712
I wish I was as strong as you are.

18:36.077 --> 18:37.524
But...

18:37.989 --> 18:39.819
I'm not.

18:46.607 --> 18:51.616
I made something for you in Belle Reve...
for when I got out.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.179
Alicia...

18:54.667 --> 18:58.428
I guess now it's a...
it's a goodbye present.

19:05.839 --> 19:09.799
Would you mind wearing it
so I can see it on you just once?

19:32.439 --> 19:33.437
Hey.

19:33.478 --> 19:34.546
Hey.

19:34.586 --> 19:36.604
I missed you in A.P. Lit today.
What happened?

19:36.646 --> 19:41.837
You decide you just couldn't face
the love songs of J. Alfred Prufrock?

19:42.168 --> 19:43.903
No, um...

19:43.939 --> 19:46.285
I went to go see Jason.

19:46.873 --> 19:49.402
Sounds like it didn't go so well.

19:49.741 --> 19:55.066
Sorry. But, uh, poker face isn't
exactly your strong suit. What's up?

19:57.282 --> 20:02.656
I think I finally figured out why
he's been so cryptic.

20:04.505 --> 20:10.328
He doesn't think that I'm ready for...
"that" kind of a relationship.

20:10.688 --> 20:14.294
What? What kind?

20:18.508 --> 20:20.859
Oh, that kind.

20:20.919 --> 20:23.643
Oh, okay.

20:23.762 --> 20:28.184
Wow, that answers a question
I've been dying to ask you all semester.

20:28.275 --> 20:32.256
- Does everybody think that we've...
- Lana.

20:32.338 --> 20:37.080
You were alone with him
for three months in Paris.

20:38.272 --> 20:41.080
Right. Um...

20:44.217 --> 20:45.964
Well, we haven't...

20:48.421 --> 20:51.665
but I'm starting to think that I'm ready.

20:55.781 --> 21:01.088
First off, don't do this just because
you're afraid to lose him if you don't.

21:02.069 --> 21:03.962
It's not that.

21:05.613 --> 21:08.237
It's just Jason's in college,

21:08.292 --> 21:12.044
and I think that he's used
to relationships that are...

21:12.483 --> 21:15.229
that area little more adult.

21:16.630 --> 21:19.889
Well, at the risk of going "After
School Special" on you, two-thirds

21:19.980 --> 21:23.338
of all people under the age of
18 regret doing it too soon.

21:25.344 --> 21:31.959
And on behalf of that two-thirds,
just be sure that you're really ready.

21:32.226 --> 21:34.327
Wait a minute.

21:34.781 --> 21:37.177
- Are you saying that you've...
- Yeah.

21:37.649 --> 21:41.226
During my intern ship at the "Daily Planet."

21:42.223 --> 21:47.444
His name was Jimmy.
He was very cute in a bow tie kind of way.

21:47.663 --> 21:50.376
You know, I mean, it was...
it was a summer

21:50.458 --> 21:53.331
infatuation that I thought
was the real thing.

21:53.390 --> 21:56.531
Do you wish you hadn't done it?

21:57.903 --> 21:59.670
Sometimes.

22:00.746 --> 22:03.993
I mean, it wasn't awful, by any means.
But it just wasn't special,

22:04.060 --> 22:07.714
and as cliché as it sounds,
it only happens once.

22:07.790 --> 22:13.967
So just make sure Jason's the guy
that you want to remember forever.

22:39.948 --> 22:41.321
Okay...

22:41.349 --> 22:43.679
can we just slow down?

22:46.232 --> 22:48.796
I want this to last forever.

22:48.849 --> 22:52.509
I'm not sure that's one of my abilities,
but I'll do my best.

22:57.107 --> 22:58.770
Okay, just one minute.

22:59.518 --> 23:00.744
What?

23:05.143 --> 23:06.345
Um...

23:06.416 --> 23:07.809
what is it?

23:12.206 --> 23:14.389
I'm a virgin.

23:16.141 --> 23:19.868
That's great. So am I.

23:20.493 --> 23:21.949
Really?

23:22.821 --> 23:23.944
What?

23:23.995 --> 23:28.221
It's just... well, we don't have
any kind of commitment or anything.

23:28.308 --> 23:29.327
Oh...

23:29.380 --> 23:33.893
Baby, no one is more committed
to making this happen than me.

23:34.663 --> 23:39.044
You are the most beautiful, amazing,
sexiest girl I've ever met.

23:39.134 --> 23:41.509
And there's no way
I'm letting you get away.

23:43.053 --> 23:45.617
Does that mean, like,
you want me to be your girlfriend?

23:45.670 --> 23:47.022
No.

23:47.916 --> 23:50.411
I want you to be my wife.

23:52.566 --> 23:54.376
Are you serious?

23:55.986 --> 23:58.691
We were meant to be together.

23:58.797 --> 24:03.137
We could be in Vegas tonight
and wake up Mr. And Mrs. in the morning.

24:03.227 --> 24:05.411
Oh, my god!

24:41.199 --> 24:46.327
We are, uh, gathered here
to join this happy couple in holy matrimony.

24:46.433 --> 24:50.364
Marriage, as you know, is a union
that should not be entered into lightly.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.504
Yeah, yeah, skip to the good stuff, pops.

24:52.547 --> 24:54.085
Oh, alright. Um...

24:55.246 --> 25:01.028
do you, Clark Kent, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

25:01.213 --> 25:02.919
Hell, yes.

25:02.985 --> 25:09.243
And do you, Alicia Baker, take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

25:09.372 --> 25:10.849
I do.

25:11.474 --> 25:15.199
Well, you may kiss the br...
oh, I see you're already doing that.

25:15.276 --> 25:19.272
Well, by the power vested in me
by the state of Nevada,

25:19.355 --> 25:22.787
I now pronounce you man and wife.

25:40.687 --> 25:43.223
My head is swimming.

25:45.445 --> 25:47.650
Don't drown just yet.

25:49.340 --> 25:52.459
Oh, my god, I can't believe this!

25:52.826 --> 25:56.008
I'm Mrs. Clark Kent.

25:58.183 --> 26:00.117
Let's make it official.

26:19.951 --> 26:21.512
Jason.

26:22.032 --> 26:23.821
You're early.

26:23.866 --> 26:26.664
I got your message. It
sounded like an emergency,

26:26.735 --> 26:28.622
so I came as soon as I could.

26:28.749 --> 26:32.057
This isn't exactly how I planned it.

26:45.392 --> 26:50.848
I need you to look me in the eye
and tell me that you don't love me.

26:57.596 --> 27:01.575
Then there's no good reason
why we shouldn't be together.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.327
Okay, I'm gonna stop you. Um...

27:18.317 --> 27:21.520
not that I wouldn't love for this to happen,

27:22.644 --> 27:24.849
but it can't.

27:25.652 --> 27:27.709
I mean, not like this.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.761
Oh, Ok. I don't understand.

27:30.822 --> 27:34.496
Um, I thought that you broke up with me

27:34.572 --> 27:35.798
because...

27:35.849 --> 27:37.846
okay, all right, um...

27:40.924 --> 27:44.272
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

27:49.248 --> 27:51.120
There's someone else.

27:53.101 --> 27:54.307
No.

27:55.175 --> 27:56.964
Um... no.

27:59.213 --> 28:01.189
Then what is it, Jason?

28:01.232 --> 28:03.816
Why did you just walk out
on this relationship?

28:03.870 --> 28:06.598
Because I don't think we met by accident.

28:08.098 --> 28:11.072
I think that my mother arranged it.

28:11.580 --> 28:13.659
How's that even possible?

28:13.702 --> 28:16.445
My mother was the one who convinced
me to go to Paris in the

28:16.527 --> 28:19.064
first place. She said that I
would meet someone special.

28:19.117 --> 28:20.531
And I did.

28:20.601 --> 28:24.820
And then everything started happening...
the tattoo and Isabelle's tomb...

28:24.907 --> 28:26.550
and the spell book.

28:26.658 --> 28:28.530
None of it made any sense.

28:29.351 --> 28:32.943
Until you saw my mother in your nightmare
about Isabelle being burned at the stake.

28:33.017 --> 28:34.868
No, that was just a bad dream, that's all.

28:34.907 --> 28:37.885
Or maybe it was your subconscious
connecting the dots.

28:39.308 --> 28:40.792
Either way,

28:40.827 --> 28:44.555
I didn't want my mother to use me
to get close to you, so, uh...

28:45.047 --> 28:46.312
Jason...

28:46.432 --> 28:51.450
whatever's going on, it doesn't change
the way that I feel about you.

28:54.288 --> 28:55.486
Yeah.

30:21.127 --> 30:23.955
Oh, god. I love you so much.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.487
I know how you feel.

30:29.908 --> 30:31.172
Wait.

30:31.226 --> 30:33.535
We don't have to wait.
We're married.

30:33.583 --> 30:34.881
No.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.988
I just want this to be right.

30:40.042 --> 30:42.305
I want all of you.

30:49.350 --> 30:50.615
What'd you do to me?

30:50.652 --> 30:52.091
Okay, don't get mad.

30:52.993 --> 30:54.901
How'd you know about the red Kryptonite?

30:54.941 --> 30:57.154
Because I know everything
about you, Clark.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.896
We were meant to be together, remember?
Just like you said.

30:59.952 --> 31:00.984
You drugged me.

31:01.024 --> 31:02.488
No, it's not...

31:02.524 --> 31:05.030
I just didn't know what else to do because...

31:05.082 --> 31:08.199
because I couldn't stay,
and I couldn't leave without you,

31:08.264 --> 31:09.628
so I just...

31:09.665 --> 31:13.208
just thought if you could listen to your heart
instead of your head for once.

31:13.281 --> 31:16.708
Look, you don't even see what you did
was wrong. What's the matter with you?

31:16.779 --> 31:17.595
I just...

31:17.636 --> 31:20.021
Clark, you could've hooked
up with any girl you wanted,

31:20.095 --> 31:21.975
and you chose me. Why do
you think that that is?

31:22.025 --> 31:24.666
You dosed me with red Kryptonite.
It makes me do things I don't want to do.

31:24.691 --> 31:27.861
No! I don't think that rock forces
you to do anything, Clark!

31:27.927 --> 31:30.021
Maybe it dampens your
inhibitions, but...

31:30.090 --> 31:32.558
Clark Kent got himself
into this situation, okay?

31:32.609 --> 31:35.920
Clark Kent asked me to marry him.

31:36.123 --> 31:39.866
Clark Kent brought me up to this hotel
to make love to me.

31:41.331 --> 31:44.176
Well, maybe Clark Kent made a mistake.

31:49.758 --> 31:51.604
No. I did.

31:53.346 --> 31:54.594
No!

32:01.932 --> 32:04.275
Her mom hasn't heard anything, either.

32:04.450 --> 32:07.079
Okay, call me if you hear anything, okay, Chloe?

32:07.137 --> 32:08.202
Thanks.

32:08.372 --> 32:10.827
I warned Alicia to stay away from you.

32:10.878 --> 32:12.525
Dr. McBride.

32:12.740 --> 32:13.971
Where is she?

32:14.010 --> 32:16.936
She called me from her cell phone... hysterical,

32:16.997 --> 32:18.967
crying that maybe she wasn't better...

32:19.008 --> 32:21.705
that maybe she belonged
back at Belle Reve.

32:21.761 --> 32:24.919
Just where you threatened to send her
if she didn't stop seeing me.

32:25.137 --> 32:27.608
Alicia is my greatest achievement.

32:27.659 --> 32:30.712
When she came to me,
her mind was fractured and broken.

32:30.775 --> 32:32.622
I made her whole again.

32:32.786 --> 32:34.203
Now look what you've done to her.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.321
What I've done?

32:35.344 --> 32:37.249
You're the reason she wanted to run away.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.923
No, you stalked her, you kidnapped her.
You forced her to marry you.

32:40.998 --> 32:42.341
That's not what happened.

32:42.369 --> 32:43.318
Well,

32:43.606 --> 32:46.092
that is what the police
will believe when I take you in.

32:46.144 --> 32:47.442
What are you doing?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.057
To help Alicia,

32:49.622 --> 32:53.259
I had to understand her obsession,
so I studied you.

32:53.571 --> 32:54.687
It wasn't hard.

32:54.780 --> 32:56.353
The sheriff's files
are filled with your

32:56.390 --> 32:59.175
unexplained appearances
at violent crime scenes.

32:59.541 --> 33:02.253
It's the classic earmarks of a troubled teen.

33:02.459 --> 33:05.947
But don't worry,
they don't send kids like you to jail.

33:06.019 --> 33:09.098
They send them to me... at Belle Reve.

33:13.789 --> 33:15.386
Clark didn't do anything.

33:15.421 --> 33:17.750
- What are you doing here?
- Alicia, get out of here.

33:17.910 --> 33:19.340
Don't tell her what to do.

33:19.397 --> 33:22.481
Clark, I know I made a huge mistake.

33:22.545 --> 33:25.407
You're the only person
who's ever really known me.

33:25.466 --> 33:26.344
Alicia...

33:26.373 --> 33:29.312
and when I'm with you, I feel normal.

33:29.373 --> 33:32.021
I'll always love you for that.

33:32.076 --> 33:34.243
No. I'm not gonna let him
keep hurting you.

33:34.288 --> 33:35.951
You don't know what
you're talking about!

33:35.986 --> 33:37.733
This stops now!

33:57.745 --> 33:58.926
Alicia.

34:04.058 --> 34:06.920
We should really get to a hospital,
don't you think?

34:06.979 --> 34:10.112
Alicia, why'd you do that?
You know I could've caught that bullet.

34:10.177 --> 34:13.404
Because I promised you that
I'd always protect your secret.

34:33.054 --> 34:33.991
Hey.

34:35.416 --> 34:36.481
Hey.

34:36.685 --> 34:38.266
How are you feeling?

34:39.388 --> 34:43.181
Like I just teleported
in front of a bullet.

34:44.879 --> 34:46.777
The doctor said you could
be released today.

34:46.842 --> 34:48.877
You might want to hold
the jokes until then.

34:49.708 --> 34:52.389
What happened to Dr. McBride?

34:52.445 --> 34:57.643
They're holding him for observation at Belle Reve
for trying to kill one of his patients.

34:59.078 --> 35:02.771
I'm so sorry about
what I did to you, Clark.

35:04.748 --> 35:06.030
I guess...

35:06.886 --> 35:10.679
I just didn't want to lose
the one good thing in my life.

35:13.463 --> 35:17.624
I'm not so sure that drugging me was
the best way to preserve the relationship.

35:29.477 --> 35:32.272
I wanted you with or without that rock.

35:34.249 --> 35:36.579
Past tense noted.

35:43.394 --> 35:45.607
Get some rest, okay?

35:59.612 --> 36:00.861
Clark?

36:04.162 --> 36:06.241
I really am sorry.

36:07.195 --> 36:09.045
You know that, right?

36:11.286 --> 36:12.634
Yeah, I know.

36:42.947 --> 36:46.580
Oh. A warm fire on a cold night.

36:46.655 --> 36:48.652
There's nothing like it, is there?

36:49.309 --> 36:51.473
Thanks for coming by, dad.

36:51.700 --> 36:54.679
I know how busy you are
with saving the world.

36:55.524 --> 37:00.050
I was, uh, hoping that your call
was an olive branch, that we could

37:00.143 --> 37:03.936
reconcile, but obviously, I was wrong.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.231
Where are you going, dad?

37:06.660 --> 37:09.688
Back to the motel out by the interstate?

37:10.534 --> 37:11.848
Or, hey,

37:11.952 --> 37:13.582
it's almost dinner time.

37:13.617 --> 37:16.995
You might still be able to make it to the mission
for your evening bowl of soup.

37:17.065 --> 37:20.992
They also serve a surprisingly
tasty Salisbury steak.

37:26.423 --> 37:30.719
You know, I gotta hand it to you, dad.
When you throw yourself into a role,

37:30.808 --> 37:32.173
you really commit.

37:32.213 --> 37:34.635
This is not an act, Lex.

37:34.685 --> 37:37.043
You should know that by now.
You've been having me

37:37.092 --> 37:38.852
followed since I was released.

37:38.889 --> 37:40.952
Which you knew I would.

37:43.030 --> 37:47.805
I'm not playing some elaborate game, Lex.
This is my life now.

37:48.157 --> 37:52.582
You've stripped me of every penny I once had,
and I'm making the best of it.

37:53.966 --> 37:56.063
And you're right. It's, uh,

37:56.933 --> 38:00.410
it's about time for my evening bowl of soup.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.229
Dad...

38:06.185 --> 38:09.063
you can stay in the guesthouse.

38:10.322 --> 38:11.304
Thanks.

38:13.798 --> 38:16.897
It'd be much easier keeping an eye on me.

38:17.989 --> 38:19.903
Good night, dad.

38:38.043 --> 38:40.157
Is dad still upset?

38:41.373 --> 38:43.420
What do you think?

38:45.247 --> 38:46.811
How about you?

38:50.627 --> 38:52.606
I'm upset.

38:54.022 --> 38:56.834
More than that, I'm disappointed.

38:59.303 --> 39:01.665
I was on red Kryptonite, mom.

39:02.319 --> 39:06.631
My god, you ran off with a girl
you barely know and got married.

39:06.720 --> 39:10.130
- It wasn't legal.
- That's not even the point.

39:10.201 --> 39:14.497
Marriage is sacred, Clark.
It's about two people who trust each other

39:14.586 --> 39:17.440
and are willing to go through
life together, no matter

39:17.524 --> 39:20.481
how difficult it gets. I thought
we had taught you that.

39:24.069 --> 39:26.203
You're an amazing young man, Clark.

39:26.248 --> 39:29.509
You make life and death decisions every day.

39:30.765 --> 39:34.981
But then you turn around and... and you do this.
Why did you do it?

39:35.068 --> 39:37.598
Mom, there's a part of me

39:37.936 --> 39:39.873
that never feels freer

39:39.914 --> 39:41.977
than when I'm with Alicia.

39:45.057 --> 39:49.500
She makes me feel normal
and special at the same time.

39:50.101 --> 39:52.507
I know how badly you want
to be with somebody.

39:52.570 --> 39:54.519
I want that for you, too.

39:57.528 --> 39:59.291
I guess...

39:59.390 --> 40:03.550
I just expected you
to use better judgment.

40:20.951 --> 40:23.363
I guess I know why you're alone.

40:23.869 --> 40:25.050
Hey.

40:25.435 --> 40:26.919
Alicia.

40:36.625 --> 40:39.337
I see you're wearing
the lead bracelet again.

40:39.641 --> 40:42.370
Yeah.
It keeps me grounded.

40:44.273 --> 40:47.310
Anyway, I just wanted
to say thank you.

40:47.974 --> 40:49.538
For what?

40:52.293 --> 40:56.020
For helping me be a better person.

41:00.686 --> 41:02.849
I have faith in you.

41:07.774 --> 41:13.219
Look, I know that we can never be
together after what I did.

41:16.085 --> 41:19.110
But it doesn't change how I feel.

41:20.285 --> 41:22.864
And I just wanted you to know that,

41:23.285 --> 41:27.378
for as long as I live, I'm never
going to reveal your secret.

41:36.026 --> 41:39.104
I love you... That's all.

41:45.357 --> 41:47.852
Alicia, wait.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.021
Wait.
