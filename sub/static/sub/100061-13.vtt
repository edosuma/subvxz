Eddie! Stop! Stop right there.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.150
Eddie, no! No!

Hey-- no, no! Eddie! Eddie!

00:23.545 --> 00:25.068
Ed-- Eddie! Eddie!

00:29.594 --> 00:30.682
Eddie.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.383
I got you. I got you, buddy.

00:35.426 --> 00:38.081
I'm right here. I'm right here.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.736
What the hell
got into you, buddy?

01:43.146 --> 01:44.974
I have a question.

01:45.017 --> 01:47.716
Why would a guy
come to a bar

01:47.759 --> 01:49.674
and order a club soda?

01:50.936 --> 01:52.895
I don't know.
Uh, it's 10:00 a.m.?

01:52.938 --> 01:54.331
That doesn't stop people
at airports.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.246
Oh, so you've been watching me?

01:56.290 --> 01:58.161
No.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.250
You are sitting
underneath the TV,

02:00.294 --> 02:02.122
and I've been
watching that.Ah.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.514
But it did
have me wonder,

02:03.558 --> 02:05.734
because there are
a lot of places a guy could go

02:05.777 --> 02:08.519
to get a glass
of carbonated water...Mm.

02:08.563 --> 02:11.131
...but you came to a bar,
and so you want to be drinking,

02:11.174 --> 02:12.871
but instead you're staring
at a cup of club soda.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.960
Are you, are you
the beverage police?

02:15.004 --> 02:16.310
Yes, I am.

02:17.485 --> 02:18.442
And I'm writing you up.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.490
You, uh...

02:22.533 --> 02:24.883
I-I do, I do, uh, drink alcohol,

02:24.927 --> 02:26.450
too, sometimes.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.452
Would you like to sit?

02:28.496 --> 02:30.280
Yeah. Okay.Yeah?

02:30.324 --> 02:31.890
Please.If you insist.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.632
Are we gonna drink alcohol?

02:34.676 --> 02:36.634
I mean, it's not the airport,

02:36.678 --> 02:39.159
but I'll give it a shot
if you want, yeah.All right.

02:39.202 --> 02:40.421
Hi.
EKA:
Hi.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.509
What can I get for you?

02:41.552 --> 02:42.466
Hi. He's gonna
have an Irish Mule,

02:42.510 --> 02:44.207
and I...Wha--

02:44.251 --> 02:45.556
Hold on. Uh,
what's a...

02:45.600 --> 02:47.079
what's an Irish Mule?Oh, no.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.342
You'll like it. It's good.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.082
Maybe I want a Scotch.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.475
Maybe this isn't about
what you want and maybe

02:51.519 --> 02:52.694
this is about what you need.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.349
I'd listen to the lady.

02:55.392 --> 02:56.654
Sounds like she knows
what she's talking about.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.961
Yeah, she does, but, um,
I-I don't even know

02:59.004 --> 03:01.224
what is in an Irish Mule.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.921
He's always like this.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.488
I'm sure he's always
like this.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.837
EKA: The ginger
in the ginger beer

03:05.881 --> 03:07.796
is gonna help improve
your brain function.

03:07.839 --> 03:10.015
Which will maybe bring you back
to the land of the living.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.017
And the whiskey, well,
that is nothing less

03:12.061 --> 03:14.019
than a time-honored tradition
to elevate one's mood.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.934
Aha.
Mm-hmm.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.762
Two Irish Mules, then.Actually, that's
too sweet for me.

03:17.806 --> 03:18.894
I'm gonna have a Scotch.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.374
Neat.
You got it.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.202
You're very funny.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.291
Mm-hmm. What's your name?

03:24.334 --> 03:25.944
Oh, God, that's so cliché.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.250
Really, you're gonna meet
someone at a bar,

03:27.294 --> 03:28.425
and that's your opening line?

03:28.469 --> 03:30.688
I just, I feel like
you're the type of guy

03:30.732 --> 03:31.907
who comes up with something
more original.

03:31.950 --> 03:34.257
I-I generally would be
that type of guy.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.128
Maybe I get a drink in me first
and that'll help.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.914
Hmm. I'll allow it.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.437
You will. Nice.Yes.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.134
Nice. This will be
a two-way street.

03:42.178 --> 03:44.224
I will not ask you your name,
I will not ask you what you do.

03:44.267 --> 03:45.747
And...

03:45.790 --> 03:47.575
we will think
of only interesting

03:47.618 --> 03:49.490
and original things
to talk about.Okay.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.970
We will do that, um...

03:52.014 --> 03:53.885
Right after you take that.

03:53.929 --> 03:56.497
It's-it's a work thing. I-I
promise I'll be right back.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.802
Mm.If you touch my Irish Mule,

03:57.846 --> 03:59.978
I'll, um, I'll do
something terrible. Okay?

04:00.022 --> 04:01.980
Give me one second.

04:02.024 --> 04:05.157
Hey. Um, I'm--
just, quick question:

04:05.201 --> 04:07.725
um, how am I supposed to have
a couple personal days

04:07.769 --> 04:09.074
if you keep calling me
all the time?

04:09.118 --> 04:10.554
STEVE:
Relax.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.382
It's not a work thing.
I'm just checking in with you.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.079
I'm-I'm doing fine.
But, hey, I-I did,

04:14.123 --> 04:16.386
I called Adam again, a-and it
went straight to voice mail.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.996
All right, so I'm thinking,Mm-hmm.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.260
usually it rings a couple times,
then it goes to voice mail.

04:20.303 --> 04:23.263
So, when-when in life
do you turn your phone off?

04:23.306 --> 04:25.395
I don't know. Uh, when I'm on
a plane, I guess.

04:25.439 --> 04:28.180
That's right. Right,
so maybe he's on his way back

04:28.224 --> 04:29.312
from wherever he was.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.271
Yeah, it's possible.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.837
Hang on. You're
okay, you're okay.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.709
It's all right.
It's all right.

04:34.752 --> 04:36.319
How's Eddie doing?

04:36.363 --> 04:37.625
Uh, he seemed
a little off when I left.

04:37.668 --> 04:39.583
No, he's worse than "off."

04:39.627 --> 04:41.846
He took off from the house, ran
into traffic on Kalanianaole.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.065
I just pulled him out.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.110
You need a hand?No, no, no, I'm good.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.895
I got the vet
coming by pretty soon.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.331
Is that the vet,
the nice vet lady

04:48.375 --> 04:50.464
that you took out on a date
and it went really great

04:50.507 --> 04:52.117
and you didn't ask her out again
because you're insane

04:52.161 --> 04:53.293
or something?

04:53.336 --> 04:55.295
Yes, her. Listen, uh...

04:55.338 --> 04:56.731
after I'm done here,
I'm gonna go

04:56.774 --> 04:58.776
grab a bite to eat.
You want to join me?

04:58.820 --> 05:00.778
Uh, no, I don't want
to have a bite with you.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.258
In fact, I am sitting
at a bar right now

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
with a very pretty lady.

05:04.347 --> 05:06.567
What are you doing talking
to me? Are you crazy?

05:06.610 --> 05:09.091
Listen to me, Danny, don't blow
this very rare opportunity

05:09.134 --> 05:10.658
that a w-- a female wants

05:10.701 --> 05:11.876
to converse with you.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.356
Get this:
she actually came up to me.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.358
Oh, wait, is she a bartender?

05:15.402 --> 05:17.186
'Cause you know that
she has to talk to you.

05:17.229 --> 05:18.361
If that's the case,
that's her job.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.798
Tell Eddie I love him.
Okay? Goodbye.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.887
Very sorry. Sorry, sorry.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.411
It's fine.
Is everything okay?

05:24.454 --> 05:25.673
Yeah, everything's good.
Okay.

05:25.716 --> 05:28.066
Ah. Ahoy.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.894
All right. Down the hatch.All right.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.679
Cheers.
Yep.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.682
Mmm.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.074
That's a lot.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.467
It's, uh, it's good.

05:37.511 --> 05:41.166
So, how-how are you liking
the island so far?

05:41.210 --> 05:42.907
So far?

05:42.951 --> 05:44.082
Mm-hmm.

05:44.126 --> 05:45.083
What makes you think
I'm new here?

05:45.127 --> 05:46.520
Oh, well, the outfit, for one.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.305
Which I like very much.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.828
It's very classy.
You look fantastic.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.526
But it's very
East Coast.

05:52.569 --> 05:55.746
And you look like, uh, you know,
you'd be gainfully employed,

05:55.790 --> 05:57.922
but, uh, we're at a bar,
not an office.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.924
Thank you.So here-here's
what I'm thinking.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.231
I'm thinking either you, um,
you got a new gig,

06:02.274 --> 06:03.406
flew out here for it,

06:03.450 --> 06:05.452
it hasn't started yet,
or you-you know,

06:05.495 --> 06:07.497
you're doing, like, half-days

06:07.541 --> 06:10.326
while you, while y-you get
yourself settled.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.110
How am I doing?
Warm? Hot? Cold?

06:12.154 --> 06:13.634
Yeah, I think
you're pretty warm.

06:13.677 --> 06:14.852
Thanks.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.071
So are you, like...

06:16.114 --> 06:17.638
you're, like,
a detective or something?

06:17.681 --> 06:20.858
Something like that.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.035
Can I tell you things?
Can I be honest?

06:24.079 --> 06:26.386
Please.I'm not,

06:26.429 --> 06:29.301
I'm not too sure
about this place.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.390
Not--

06:30.433 --> 06:31.956
The, um, the island.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.524
Ah. I understand.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.484
And, uh, I felt the same way
when I first got here,

06:37.527 --> 06:39.703
but it grows on you.

06:39.747 --> 06:42.227
Right. I'll believe that.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.403
Mm-hmm.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.379
DANNY:
That was, uh...

07:03.423 --> 07:05.381
Yeah, it was.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.427
For the record-- not that, uh,

07:07.470 --> 07:08.558
you're keeping a
record or anything...

07:08.602 --> 07:10.430
...but, uh, I've
never done

07:10.473 --> 07:12.040
this before.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.131
Yeah. Me, neither.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.698
Oh, that's good.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.396
Um...

07:20.440 --> 07:22.006
I don't know, if you're up
for it sometime, maybe

07:22.050 --> 07:23.530
I'd like to take you out to
dinner or something like that?

07:23.573 --> 07:25.575
: Take me out to dinner?Yeah, something
like that.

07:25.619 --> 07:28.709
Yes, I would, um,
I would like that very much.

07:28.752 --> 07:29.971
Good.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.581
Good.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.975
Just, um...

07:34.018 --> 07:35.150
What-what are
you doing?

07:35.193 --> 07:36.586
I'm calling a Lyft.

07:36.630 --> 07:37.892
Oh, why you calling a Lyft?

07:37.935 --> 07:39.328
I think, I think I could
give you a ride home.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.678
Oh, you could give me a ride?Mm-hmm.

07:42.723 --> 07:43.898
You don't, you don't
have to do that.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.465
I know, I'd like to do that.

07:45.508 --> 07:46.770
Uh, and I had one sip
of that drink.

07:46.814 --> 07:48.468
Yes. I know,
you did not like that.

07:48.511 --> 07:49.991
It was okay.

07:51.645 --> 07:53.473
I guess I'm gonna get
in a strange man's car.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.475
You are gonna get in a strange
man's midsize rental.

07:55.518 --> 07:56.606
Wow.Yeah.

07:56.650 --> 07:57.912
A midsize rental.Yeah. But it came

07:57.955 --> 08:00.392
with a beautiful, uh,
tropical air freshener.

08:00.436 --> 08:01.785
Wow. Uh, you know,

08:01.829 --> 08:03.787
on second thought,
I'll probably just take the bus.

08:03.831 --> 08:05.485
Shut up.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.095
Whoa, hey.

08:07.138 --> 08:09.140
What?You trying
to get busted?

08:09.184 --> 08:10.490
Let me just make sure
the coast is clear.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.100
Frickin' amateur hour over here.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.884
Sorry, sorry.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.090
it was pretty cool

08:46.134 --> 08:47.396
'cause it's about
a half a block away

08:47.439 --> 08:49.485
from where Benny Agbayani went
to high school.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.748
Okay, stop everything right now.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.228
Did you just name-drop

08:53.271 --> 08:55.926
late-90s Mets outfielder
Benny Agbayani?

08:55.970 --> 08:58.102
Wow.
You got that reference.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.495
Yeah-- Me? I'm-I'm--
the Hawaiian Punch?

08:59.539 --> 09:00.757
I was at the game.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.193
No, you were not. You were not.Yes, I was.

09:02.237 --> 09:03.673
Don't-- No. No.I'm telling you,

09:03.717 --> 09:05.022
it was the craziest thing
I've ever seen live.

09:05.066 --> 09:07.198
I'm telling you,
it was, it was, it was nuts.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.504
That's crazy.
Thought it was the third out.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.114
Yeah.Ah, I knew

09:10.158 --> 09:11.638
you were from the East Coast.
You're from the East Coast.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.641
Okay, I think that
you are from... Jersey.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.773
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

09:16.817 --> 09:17.774
I love Jersey.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.646
That makes two of us.

09:19.689 --> 09:20.908
Well, I'm from Massapequa.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.126
All right. Strong Island.

09:22.170 --> 09:23.301
But I love Passaic.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.216
My-my favorite aunt lived there.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.522
Okay.Yeah, it was the best.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.656
I'd go see her
and we'd watch R-rated movies

09:29.699 --> 09:31.527
and we'd order sausage pizza
from Romeo's.

09:31.571 --> 09:35.313
Romeo's. Well, your aunt
has very good taste.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.844
He sees us, right?

09:43.887 --> 09:45.149
Hey...
Hold on.

09:46.411 --> 09:47.456
Oh, my God!

10:15.049 --> 10:16.572
Doc, hey. Thanks so much.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.008
Uh, come in, come in.

10:18.052 --> 10:22.273
Um, I know you don't
usually do house calls.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.927
Yeah, no, I don't,
but it sounded urgent.

10:23.971 --> 10:25.320
Where is he?He's in the kitchen.

10:25.363 --> 10:26.930
Small confined space, right?
Like you said.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.454
Yeah, good. Oh,
well, uh-- whoa.

10:29.498 --> 10:30.586
Probably, it's...

10:30.630 --> 10:32.196
probably best if I conduct

10:32.240 --> 10:33.763
my initial exam without you.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.766
It's just that dogs, they pick
up on our anxiety and...

10:36.810 --> 10:38.159
Yeah, I got a little bit
of that today.Yeah.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.595
Um, just so you know,

10:39.639 --> 10:43.207
uh, what's been going on lately,
has been, uh, bizarre.

10:43.251 --> 10:44.774
I mean, he's not himself.How so?

10:44.818 --> 10:46.297
What do you mean?Well, he's kind of s--

10:46.341 --> 10:47.647
he's skittish and jumpy,
he's, like,

10:47.690 --> 10:49.300
on high alert all the time.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.781
And you know Eddie.
He's a relaxed guy.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.001
Right? I mean,
at the moment, I can't,

10:54.044 --> 10:56.481
I can't close a drawer
in the, in the bedroom

10:56.525 --> 10:57.874
without him
totally freaking out.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.615
And this morning, the door
was cracked a little bit.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.138
He bolted.
He's never done that before.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.924
He ended up in the middle
of Kalanianaole.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.143
Almost got us both killed
pulling him out of that traffic.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.972
Well, uh, how about I
go take a look at him?

11:09.016 --> 11:11.235
Yeah, yeah; yeah, yeah. Okay.

11:14.151 --> 11:15.718
Hey, there, Eddie.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.981
Remember me?
Stitched you up

11:18.025 --> 11:20.984
a little while back?

11:21.028 --> 11:24.248
All right... it's maybe not
the most pleasant of memories.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.990
Right? I thought we had a
little bit of a bond, hmm?

11:27.034 --> 11:30.124
Now let's see what's going on
with you, bud.

11:30.167 --> 11:33.997
Come on. Let's see, bud...

11:34.041 --> 11:35.695
Good boy...

11:37.174 --> 11:41.613
All right. Let's just check
those pearly whites...

11:42.963 --> 11:45.748
All right.
Good boy.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.359
Good boy.

11:58.892 --> 12:00.850
Uh, hey...

12:00.894 --> 12:03.723
Look at me.
You okay?
Yeah...

12:03.766 --> 12:05.855
Look at me.
Uh, it hurts...

12:05.899 --> 12:07.291
All right.
It hurts.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.729
Okay.
I'm gonna get my
phone, all right?

12:14.908 --> 12:15.952
Hey.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.562
Mm-hmm?Where's your phone?

12:17.606 --> 12:21.436
Uh, it's in my, um,
it's in my bag.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.666
LESLIE:
Oh, God,
my legs...

12:34.710 --> 12:36.799
God, it hurts.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.586
Okay.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.153
All right.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.155
We got no service.
I'm gonna...

12:45.199 --> 12:46.896
I'm gonna go up
to the road,

12:46.940 --> 12:50.334
try to get a signal, okay?Mm-hmm...

12:50.378 --> 12:52.162
All right?

12:52.206 --> 12:53.642
Okay.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.470
We're gonna be fine,
all right? I promise.

12:55.513 --> 12:56.819
Sorry.

12:56.863 --> 13:00.475
Huh?Mm...

13:00.518 --> 13:03.043
Seven-two-four.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.393
Huh?
The, um...
the last three digits...

13:05.436 --> 13:07.874
...of the plate
were seven, two, four.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.659
Don't worry about
that right now, okay?You have to tell...

13:10.702 --> 13:12.269
you have
to tell the police,

13:12.313 --> 13:13.836
so that he doesn't
hurt anyone.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.882
He already hurt somebody.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.841
Just...

13:18.885 --> 13:20.887
just breathe.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.279
It's gonna be okay,
I promise, all right?

13:22.323 --> 13:24.455
Be right back.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.414
Seven-two-four, right?
Got it.Seven-two-four.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.991
The door's jammed.

13:56.966 --> 14:00.143
Hey.Hey.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.929
He's showing signs of
post-traumatic stress.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.321
PTS?

14:04.365 --> 14:06.628
Okay, h-- I know
military working dogs

14:06.671 --> 14:09.326
can get PTS, but he's never
shown a hint of that.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.763
Maybe so. But what he's
exhibiting right now,

14:11.807 --> 14:12.982
hyper-vigilance,

14:13.026 --> 14:14.766
an elevated heart
rate, dilated pupils;

14:14.810 --> 14:16.377
those are
telltale signs.Doc, this doesn't

14:16.420 --> 14:18.161
make any sense.
Uh, look, after the Marines,

14:18.205 --> 14:20.816
he was with the DEA for years.
Why now?

14:20.860 --> 14:25.690
Look, Steve, you and I both know
PTS is varied; it's complex.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.649
We understand very little
of how it affects humans,

14:27.692 --> 14:28.998
much less dogs.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.434
I don't know;
in my opinion,

14:30.478 --> 14:33.220
I think that Eddie must have
some long-buried trauma

14:33.263 --> 14:35.700
that for some reason
has just resurfaced.

14:35.744 --> 14:38.051
But I don't know. I'm not
an expert in this, so...

14:38.094 --> 14:40.923
sorry I... can't
be more helpful.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.577
No, no, you've been
plenty helpful, thank you.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.579
I'm, I'm just, you know...

14:47.538 --> 14:49.410
Thank you.

14:49.453 --> 14:50.759
I mean...

14:52.979 --> 14:55.285
I-I got a place
to start now, right?Yeah.

14:55.329 --> 14:56.852
Um, Emma,

14:56.896 --> 14:58.245
before you leave?

14:58.288 --> 15:00.160
I feel like I should probably
bring up the, uh...

15:00.203 --> 15:02.814
How-- how you never
called me back?

15:02.858 --> 15:04.077
Yes. That.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.252
And, uh...

15:05.295 --> 15:07.558
first of all, I'm really sorry.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.169
I just want to let you know
that, uh,

15:09.212 --> 15:10.605
it wasn't because
I didn't like you,

15:10.648 --> 15:13.086
'cause I did, I do.
I mean...

15:14.914 --> 15:19.570
I have always had a problem
balancing the job with my life,

15:19.614 --> 15:22.225
and historically,

15:22.269 --> 15:25.185
uh, my personal life always
gets the short end of the stick,

15:25.228 --> 15:28.884
and I guess I just wanted
to let you know that, um...

15:28.928 --> 15:30.277
it wasn't a you issue.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.280
Uh... I'm the problem.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.893
Typically, when men say
something like that to me,

15:37.937 --> 15:38.981
I think about

15:39.025 --> 15:41.375
which shin I should
kick.

15:41.418 --> 15:43.029
But...

15:43.072 --> 15:46.032
I don't know, for some reason,
when you say it, I believe you.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.425
Well, you should,
'cause it's the truth.

15:48.469 --> 15:51.951
Yeah. Hey, look,
there's no hard feelings.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.257
'Cause I'm seeing someone.

15:54.301 --> 15:56.085
That's great.Yeah, it turns out
there are some good guys

15:56.129 --> 15:57.739
on those godforsaken apps, so...

15:57.782 --> 15:59.959
I'm legitimately happy for you.
You deserve it.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.395
Thanks.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.875
Anyway, I don't want
to hold you hostage.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.616
Thank you.
Bye, Steve.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.967
Oh, and keep me
posted on Eddie.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.838
I will, I promise.
Thanks again, Emma.Yeah.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.589
Big man on campus.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.286
How's Parents Weekend?GROVER: Expensive.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.332
Renee's got me
running all over the place

16:25.375 --> 16:26.898
running errands
while she's helping Will

16:26.942 --> 16:29.118
decorate his
new off-campus apartment.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.033
Uh-huh.Boy, these kids now.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.035
Did you know, when I went away
to school,

16:33.079 --> 16:34.863
you know what my parents
gave me?

16:34.906 --> 16:37.866
A ratty old blanket and a roll
of quarters for the pay phone

16:37.909 --> 16:38.998
and the laundromat.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.131
Now, Father of the Year,

16:42.175 --> 16:44.916
aka yours truly,
is going out to buy Will

16:44.960 --> 16:49.486
a flat screen TV and a portable
air conditioning unit.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.836
Come on, you love spoiling
that kid, you know it.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.925
Yeah, I know, but let that be
our little secret.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.318
Listen, the reason
I'm calling you

16:55.362 --> 16:57.146
is because I got a text

16:57.190 --> 17:00.149
from Tani, and she said
that Eddie's in a bad way.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.324
He's not doing too good.

17:01.368 --> 17:02.586
The vet just left.

17:02.630 --> 17:03.935
She said she thinks it's PTS,

17:03.979 --> 17:05.720
but she's no expert.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.723
Well, fret not, pal of mine,
because I happen to know one.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.290
Will played high school baseball

17:10.333 --> 17:14.250
with the son
of a resident Army veterinarian.

17:14.294 --> 17:17.688
And his primary expertise
is in military working dogs.

17:17.732 --> 17:18.820
Are you kidding me right now?

17:18.863 --> 17:19.951
About Eddie?

17:19.995 --> 17:22.084
Bite your tongue, man.
I love that dog,

17:22.128 --> 17:23.868
so I reached out to him.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.697
And he thinks he can help.
His name is Dr. Art Currin.

17:26.741 --> 17:30.353
You'll find him at the
Veterinary Treatment Facility

17:30.397 --> 17:31.746
at Fort Shafter.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.270
And he's expecting you, too.
How about that?

17:34.314 --> 17:36.533
Thank you so much, Lou.
I really appreciate this.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.709
No problem, man.
Anything for that pup.

17:38.753 --> 17:41.277
All right, I got to go.
I'm late for an argument.

17:45.107 --> 17:48.328
Shh... you're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

18:30.500 --> 18:34.417
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.593
You were right
to bring him in.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.466
Eddie is definitely
exhibiting signs of canine PTS.

18:39.509 --> 18:41.598
He recently
suffer any trauma

18:41.642 --> 18:43.383
in the field?

18:43.426 --> 18:45.254
No. I mean, that's the thing.

18:45.298 --> 18:46.951
He's been, he's been
with me for, uh,

18:46.995 --> 18:48.257
couple years now, and

18:48.301 --> 18:51.956
he's been exposed to, to
gunshots, to explosions,

18:52.000 --> 18:54.045
uh, he's-he's never
had a bad reaction.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.137
Before he came to me,
he was a DEA dog.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.139
And then preceding that,
he was with a Marine unit

19:00.182 --> 19:01.488
in Afghanistan.

19:01.531 --> 19:04.099
I'm trying to
think what I

19:04.143 --> 19:05.361
could have exposed him to.

19:05.405 --> 19:06.797
I've had a lot going on
in my personal life.

19:06.841 --> 19:09.496
I-I guess, uh...

19:09.539 --> 19:11.411
It's killing me, Doc,
to think that maybe

19:11.454 --> 19:13.369
I-I've exposed
him to something

19:13.413 --> 19:15.284
that's, that's, that's
had this reaction.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.547
I can tell you're hurting.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.810
You shouldn't
beat yourself up.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.899
It's not uncommon
for canine PTS

19:21.943 --> 19:26.382
to stay dormant for weeks,
months, sometimes years;

19:26.426 --> 19:28.210
lying dormant till something
sets it off.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.387
That something can be a sound,
sight, smell.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.476
Literally anything
can bring an old trauma

19:33.520 --> 19:34.869
back to the surface.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.827
My guess, this didn't happen
because of something

19:36.871 --> 19:38.307
you exposed him to.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.831
You would have noticed the signs
immediately if you had.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.833
More likely, Eddie was alone

19:42.877 --> 19:44.313
when the triggering
event happened;

19:44.357 --> 19:47.011
in your home,
perhaps outside.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.057
It's not your fault, Commander.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.451
Now let's
talk treatment.Mm.

19:51.494 --> 19:52.843
First, I'll administer
an anxiolytic

19:52.887 --> 19:54.541
to help with
the underlying anxiety.

19:55.542 --> 19:58.022
Honestly, the meds
are just a band-aid.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.851
You're gonna have to figure out
exactly what triggered Eddie

20:00.895 --> 20:02.723
and remove it
from his environment,

20:02.766 --> 20:06.161
or, frankly, his condition's
only gonna get worse.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.771
That said,

20:07.815 --> 20:10.209
you can't know what you need
to remove until you determine

20:10.252 --> 20:11.253
the root cause of this trauma.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.081
Right.

20:13.124 --> 20:15.605
Lou tells me you're
a seasoned investigator.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.868
Something like that, yeah.

20:17.912 --> 20:20.697
It's time to investigate this.Understood.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.439
Eddie's first handler...

20:23.483 --> 20:25.398
he was killed in action
in Afghanistan.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.922
You know any details about how?

20:27.965 --> 20:28.966
No.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.272
Well, then I'd start there.

20:35.538 --> 20:39.063
Steve. You got
me and Quinn.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.413
How's the little man?

20:41.457 --> 20:43.242
He's all right.
He's a little quiet.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.591
I think it's the meds.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.419
So the Army vet was helpful?

20:46.462 --> 20:47.898
He was. He was very helpful.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.378
But, uh, Eddie's not
out of the woods yet.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.989
We still need to figure out
what triggered it.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.991
So where do we start, boss?

20:54.035 --> 20:57.691
We start by turning back
the clock.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.259
Eddie's first handler
was killed in action

21:00.302 --> 21:01.695
in Afghanistan.
I want to know everything

21:01.738 --> 21:03.262
that happened that day.
Okay?

21:03.305 --> 21:05.568
The doctor seems to think
that his trauma is rooted there,

21:05.612 --> 21:07.178
so let's dig around
and see if we can find

21:07.222 --> 21:08.354
anything actionable.

21:08.397 --> 21:11.357
If we can't,
look into his DEA history.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.272
But my gut says

21:13.315 --> 21:15.709
that the doctor's right, and his
trauma is linked to the death

21:15.752 --> 21:17.406
of his old handler.

21:17.450 --> 21:21.671
That was a one-of-a-kind bond,
and it got broken.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.673
In the meantime,
I don't want to leave him alone,

21:23.717 --> 21:25.153
so if you guys
could do me a favor,

21:25.196 --> 21:27.938
I want you to go talk
to Colonel O'Donnell at MCBH.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.462
He should be able
to put us in contact

21:29.505 --> 21:31.290
with Eddie's old unit.TANI: On it.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.987
We'll send you an update ASAP

21:33.030 --> 21:34.989
as long as you give Eddie
a belly rub from us.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.120
STEVE:
Will do.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.473
Hang in
there, buddy.

21:45.739 --> 21:49.438
Okay. All right,
just relax, okay?

21:49.482 --> 21:51.962
Here's what we're gonna do.
I just need to get you stable.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.616
I'm gonna go
up the road

21:53.660 --> 21:55.139
and I'm gonna flag down a car,
all right?

21:55.183 --> 21:56.140
We're gonna take a look.

21:56.184 --> 21:58.229
Okay?
Okay.

21:58.273 --> 21:59.796
Let me see.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.451
Okay, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
No, no, no, no, no.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.541
I can't feel my l-- I can't
feel my leg, can't feel my leg.Sorry.

22:05.585 --> 22:07.238
It hurts everywhere. There's
something wrong with my back.

22:07.282 --> 22:10.459
Okay, all right, so look,
just breathe, focus on me.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.983
Look at me. Everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

22:13.027 --> 22:14.245
I'm just gonna
check you out

22:14.289 --> 22:15.943
and see where else
you're hurt, okay?

22:15.986 --> 22:18.075
Yeah, you do that.
You need to do that.All right.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.469
Lean forward a little bit,
just a little bit.

22:20.513 --> 22:21.862
Little bit,
little bit.

22:21.905 --> 22:23.646
Okay, I see it.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.999
DANNY:
Okay.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.174
All right.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.525
All right,
stay like that.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.486
What is that? What is that?It's just a little cut.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.401
What was that?
What is it? Is it bad?

22:39.445 --> 22:41.664
It's bad.No. It's just a little cut.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.145
Just, look it, look it,
I got to get it cleaned up,

22:44.188 --> 22:45.755
and then we'll
be okay, all right?

22:47.104 --> 22:48.715
Just tell me.

22:48.758 --> 22:52.283
Just don't lie to me, please.
Don't lie to me now.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.115
It's not good.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.682
Okay?
It's a little bad,

22:59.726 --> 23:01.728
but I'm gonna fix it, all right?
I'm gonna get you stable,

23:01.771 --> 23:03.120
and everything's
gonna be okay.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.384
You are gonna make it
through this. You understand?

23:05.427 --> 23:07.255
Yeah.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.350
O'DONNELL:
You're looking for

23:15.394 --> 23:17.961
personnel information
on the dog's old unit?Yes, sir.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.311
Eddie, is it?
TANI: Correct.
Um, specifically,

23:20.355 --> 23:22.226
we would be grateful to speak
with any of the Marines

23:22.270 --> 23:24.881
that were on duty the day
that Eddie's handler was killed.

23:24.925 --> 23:27.580
I understand.
Uh, Corporal Bollinger

23:27.623 --> 23:30.626
was killed
in Farah Province

23:30.670 --> 23:33.150
on July 9, 2013.

23:33.194 --> 23:36.066
Of the unit on patrol,
two men died that day.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.808
Another two are on
active missions

23:38.852 --> 23:41.158
in classified locations,
thus unreachable.

23:42.508 --> 23:43.770
But it looks as though
two Marines

23:43.813 --> 23:45.075
might be available
to make contact.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.121
That's great.

23:47.164 --> 23:49.950
One has left the service.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.648
He's now a firefighter
in Portland.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.781
Uh, Maine, not Oregon.

23:54.824 --> 23:55.956
And the other,

23:55.999 --> 24:00.264
he was the unit's
radio operator.

24:00.308 --> 24:03.833
He's currently stationed
at Marine Wing Liaison Kadena

24:03.877 --> 24:05.922
at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa.

24:05.966 --> 24:08.925
Great. Thank you
so much, Colonel.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.406
Happy to help.Thank you.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.277
I hope the warrior's
better soon.

24:13.321 --> 24:14.931
Thank you, sir.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.934
Absolutely.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.462
LESLIE:
Anything?

24:23.505 --> 24:25.812
I'm looking.

24:25.855 --> 24:28.336
I thought you said
this place grows on you.

24:28.379 --> 24:31.774
It does. Do me a favor
and don't talk.

24:31.818 --> 24:32.993
You got to save
your energy, okay?

24:37.954 --> 24:40.783
There's so much blood.I know.

24:40.827 --> 24:43.133
I'll take care of that
right now, okay?

24:43.177 --> 24:45.962
Okay.Lean forward

24:46.006 --> 24:47.921
for me. Breathe.Mm-hmm.

24:51.141 --> 24:52.621
All right.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.539
Lean back,

24:57.583 --> 25:00.847
and good pressure on that, okay?

25:00.890 --> 25:02.762
All right, we're gonna
take care of this now.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.028
This is probably
gonna hurt,

25:08.071 --> 25:09.203
but I got to stop this
bleeding, all right?

25:12.772 --> 25:14.687
Okay, I got it.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.606
Come on, come on, you're tough.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.346
You're tough.
Look at me.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.348
Look at me.
Stay with me, okay?

25:26.350 --> 25:27.700
I'm scared.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.832
I know you're scared,
but you don't have to be.

25:29.876 --> 25:32.748
You're gonna be okay.
I'm right here, all right?I don't pray.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.968
You don't have to pray.I should pray.

25:35.011 --> 25:37.492
No, you don't have to pray
'cause I'm right here, okay?

25:37.536 --> 25:40.147
All you got to do is hang tough.
All right? Look at me,

25:40.190 --> 25:42.584
we're gonna get out of this
thing. I'm gonna go up there,

25:42.628 --> 25:44.543
I'm gonna flag down a car,
we're gonna go home.

25:44.586 --> 25:48.024
Okay? Promise.
I promise.

25:48.068 --> 25:50.984
Don't get upset,
okay?

25:51.027 --> 25:53.987
You know, since we're being
honest with each other, I, um,

25:54.030 --> 25:57.338
something I didn't tell you
that I think I should.

25:57.381 --> 25:58.600
You know, you said your aunt

25:58.644 --> 26:00.471
used to take you to,
uh, to Romeo's.

26:00.515 --> 26:03.257
I know Romeo's very well.
I actually got into

26:03.300 --> 26:05.172
a-a fight in front of Romeo's
when I was in,

26:05.215 --> 26:07.000
when I was in school
when I was a kid.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.436
You serious right now?

26:08.479 --> 26:10.220
Yeah. Seventh grade.
Seventh grade,

26:10.264 --> 26:12.658
there was these two big
high school jerks

26:12.701 --> 26:14.834
that were messing with my
friend, calling him fat 'cause--

26:14.877 --> 26:16.487
I don't know,
calling him butterball.

26:16.531 --> 26:17.663
Well, was he fat?

26:17.706 --> 26:19.316
Yeah, he was very fat.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.362
You know, he was,
he was a big kid.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.320
He used to pop zeppolis
like they were Tic Tacs.

26:23.364 --> 26:25.758
Anyway, it doesn't justify
the ridicule, you know?

26:25.801 --> 26:28.543
I agree with that.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.849
What happened?

26:29.892 --> 26:33.853
Why, I, uh, I, uh...
They were in high school.

26:33.896 --> 26:35.768
They were big high school
basketball players.

26:35.811 --> 26:39.685
They beat me up pretty good.
I got my ass kicked, you know.

26:39.728 --> 26:43.340
You're a good guy.Thanks.

26:47.214 --> 26:49.695
QUINN: Just got a text from
the radio op, he should be ready

26:49.738 --> 26:51.044
to Skype McGarrett
in a few minutes.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.176
Cool.

26:53.220 --> 26:55.831
Eddie okay?He's restless.

26:55.875 --> 26:59.879
He's restless. McGarrett's
trying to settle him for a nap.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.185
He did lap up some of the water
from the bowl

27:02.229 --> 27:03.796
that I brought, though, so...

27:03.839 --> 27:06.407
Oh, that's weird. Did you tell
him the water was for Eddie?

27:10.933 --> 27:12.718
You want to talk about it?

27:12.761 --> 27:15.242
I don't know.
I-- Okay, fine. Yeah. Um...

27:15.285 --> 27:18.332
So I go upstairs, and
I'm-I'm thinking about Eddie,

27:18.375 --> 27:19.986
and I'm-I'm worried about him.
I'm thinking about

27:20.029 --> 27:22.118
all the terrible things
that have happened to him.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.424
I'm thinking about
the trauma that

27:23.467 --> 27:25.469
almost got him killed today.

27:25.513 --> 27:27.950
And then I-I walked by
Junior's room...

27:30.039 --> 27:31.258
Junior's not invincible either.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.086
And now he's off on

27:33.129 --> 27:35.175
his secret SEAL mission,
and I haven't

27:35.218 --> 27:37.307
heard from him since
the morning that he left.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.745
But, like, I'm-I'm-I'm trying
not to think about it.

27:39.788 --> 27:44.575
Um... Just...
being in this house is...

27:44.619 --> 27:46.926
doesn't make it easier.

27:46.969 --> 27:49.189
You're right.

27:49.232 --> 27:51.104
Junior's not invincible,

27:51.147 --> 27:54.281
but he is tough as hell.

27:54.324 --> 27:55.761
And I know that
he will do everything

27:55.804 --> 27:57.763
that he can to get
back home safe,

27:57.806 --> 28:01.331
back to the people
that he loves.

28:09.296 --> 28:11.951
Hey. You okay?
Hi. Yeah.

28:11.994 --> 28:14.257
I think he, uh, he's
finally sleeping, so...

28:14.301 --> 28:16.390
Okay, this is him.

28:16.433 --> 28:19.698
Okay, his name is
Sergeant Victor Michaels.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.569
I brought him
up to speed.
Copy that.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.876
Sergeant Michaels,
can you hear me?

28:23.919 --> 28:25.442
Loud and clear, Commander.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.314
Thank you very much for your
time today. I appreciate it.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.445
Hey, I always got time
for Eddie.

28:28.489 --> 28:29.969
Sorry to hear
what he's going through.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.232
Yeah,
appreciate that.

28:32.275 --> 28:34.713
We spoke with his doctor,
and the doctor said if we can

28:34.756 --> 28:36.366
figure out what the-the
trigger is for him,

28:36.410 --> 28:39.326
then maybe we can prevent this
from happening in the future.

28:39.369 --> 28:42.764
We're pretty sure it's connected
to the death of his handler,

28:42.808 --> 28:45.419
so-- and I'm very sorry
to ask this

28:45.462 --> 28:47.943
'cause I know how hard it is--
but anything you could

28:47.987 --> 28:50.729
tell us about
that day, uh,

28:50.772 --> 28:52.513
it'd be really helpful.

28:52.556 --> 28:55.821
Of course.

28:55.864 --> 28:57.866
That's not the kind of day
you forget.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.304
As soon as we got out
of the Humvees,

29:01.348 --> 29:04.873
I had that...
that eerie feeling.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.701
You know the one,

29:06.745 --> 29:08.703
like there was death
in the air.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.879
The area was littered
with IEDs.

29:10.923 --> 29:13.708
It felt like the whole place
could blow at any second.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.363
Eddie, he had about
the best nose in the Corps.

29:16.406 --> 29:19.192
That area was a straight-up
death trap.

29:19.235 --> 29:21.194
All it took is
for one boot to take

29:21.237 --> 29:22.499
one step out
of formation, and...

29:24.719 --> 29:25.981
Suddenly I was on my back.

29:26.025 --> 29:27.809
I remember
the first thing I saw

29:27.853 --> 29:30.333
were purple flowers,

29:30.377 --> 29:32.379
covered in blood that
I thought was mine.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.382
And that's when
I spotted Eddie.

29:35.425 --> 29:38.080
He looked injured,
but then he got up.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.388
He had to find his handler.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.564
Those two had a special bond.

29:56.185 --> 29:57.883
Bollinger
was a good man.

29:57.926 --> 30:01.669
I'm sure he was. I'm sorry.

30:01.712 --> 30:03.410
Thank you, Commander.

30:03.453 --> 30:05.586
I'm not sure
if any of that helps.I know, I...

30:05.629 --> 30:07.196
I think it really does. Listen,

30:07.240 --> 30:08.850
those purple flowers
you mentioned, you remember

30:08.894 --> 30:10.286
what they were called?

30:10.330 --> 30:12.114
Oh, yeah, they grew all over
the place in, uh, Farah.

30:12.158 --> 30:13.420
It's that restharrow stuff.

30:13.463 --> 30:14.551
Restharrow.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.858
Well, thank you again, Sergeant.

30:16.902 --> 30:20.949
Of course. And look,
you take care of that dog, sir.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.472
Lord knows he took care of us.

30:22.516 --> 30:23.647
I will.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.048
See what I'm seeing?

30:33.092 --> 30:34.833
If you're talking about
the look of a man

30:34.876 --> 30:37.444
who's about to crack the code,
then that's an affirmative.

30:39.925 --> 30:44.146
All right,
all right.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.801
Hey. I need you to lean forward.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.238
I'm gonna change
these dressings, okay?

30:57.899 --> 31:00.467
Can I ask you something?Of course.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.512
Why were you in that bar?

31:02.556 --> 31:05.907
That's really what you want
to talk about right now?

31:05.951 --> 31:08.344
If I can't be rescued,
I shall be entertained.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.651
You are going
to be rescued, okay?

31:10.694 --> 31:13.567
I was in that bar

31:13.610 --> 31:17.832
because I was in a mood
because of my ex-wife.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.703
Yeah, yeah, that'll do it.

31:21.836 --> 31:26.319
How long you been
split up?

31:26.362 --> 31:29.670
If I, uh, if I try to tell you
that whole story,

31:29.713 --> 31:31.498
we'll both be dead
before I finish.

31:31.541 --> 31:35.589
We were sort of trying to
work it out the last year or so.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.417
Didn't take?
No, no.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.245
We're better off as friends.Yeah.

31:39.288 --> 31:42.639
I've been there.
Yeah? You got
some stories of your own?

31:42.683 --> 31:44.380
Mm-hmm.
Really?

31:44.424 --> 31:46.078
A lady never tells.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.122
Ah.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.300
It's a car.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.085
No, no, no, no. You can't
leave me, you can't leave me.Hey, look at me,

31:53.128 --> 31:55.043
look at me, look at me.
You're fine.You can't leave me,

31:55.087 --> 31:56.349
you can't go.I'll stop the car,
we get an ambulance,

31:56.392 --> 31:57.480
and then we go home, okay?

31:57.524 --> 31:58.917
That's all, that's all.Please don't go.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.977
Hey!

32:16.021 --> 32:18.284
Stop!
Hey, hey!

32:18.327 --> 32:19.850
Hey!

32:19.894 --> 32:21.374
Hey!

32:45.398 --> 32:47.269
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

32:47.313 --> 32:48.575
Hey, wake up.

32:48.618 --> 32:50.403
Wake up, wake up.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.013
There you go.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.536
Hey, I missed the car. Okay?

32:53.580 --> 32:54.581
Okay.
It's not your fault.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.409
Oh, thank you.

32:56.452 --> 32:58.324
Mm-hmm. Are you
always this unlucky?

32:58.367 --> 33:00.761
I was in that bar, wasn't I?
Come on.

33:00.804 --> 33:02.067
Mm.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.633
Let me check you out here.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.986
Let me see.
All right, this is good.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.552
Let me see your back.

33:09.596 --> 33:12.207
Hey, you gotta stay awake
for me. Okay?

33:12.251 --> 33:13.252
Stay awake.

33:17.082 --> 33:19.301
You're out of towels.

33:19.345 --> 33:20.433
It's all right.

33:22.261 --> 33:23.305
It's gonna be okay.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.525
Not of we don't
stop the bleeding.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.832
I got this. Gonna...

33:41.019 --> 33:43.151
All right, lean back.
Lean back.

33:43.195 --> 33:44.326
Pressure.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.024
You gotta keep pressure
on your back

33:46.067 --> 33:47.895
and you're gonna be fine.
We're getting out of here. Okay?

33:47.938 --> 33:50.115
All right?

33:50.158 --> 33:53.683
Just breathe easy. Easy, okay?

34:10.396 --> 34:11.658
Excuse me.

34:11.701 --> 34:13.007
Hi.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.054
Hello.
Can I help you?

34:16.097 --> 34:17.577
We sure hope so.
I'm Tani Rey.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.839
This is Quinn Liu.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.319
We work with your neighbor,
Steve McGarrett.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.016
I hope we're
not intruding.No, not at all.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.106
Steve mentioned you're
a botany professor.
I am.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.107
We came from central
Connecticut,

34:26.151 --> 34:27.543
so this is paradise.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.893
The biodiversity of flora here
is incredible.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.460
90% of plant life
found in Hawaii

34:31.504 --> 34:33.158
can't be found anywhere else
in the world.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.120
Sorry. Uh, you obviously
didn't come by

34:39.164 --> 34:42.123
to hear me geek out
about plants.Actually...

34:42.167 --> 34:45.039
Oahu's climate can support the
growth of just about anything,

34:45.083 --> 34:47.128
so I've planted rare species
from all over the world.

34:47.172 --> 34:49.087
For my students to study
and enjoy.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.567
Someday for my son, too.

34:51.611 --> 34:52.655
This is the one
you were asking about.

34:52.699 --> 34:54.004
Spiny restharrow.

34:54.048 --> 34:55.963
Known to Latin speakers
as ononis spinosa.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.878
It's quite lovely,
isn't it?TANI: It is, yeah.

34:57.921 --> 34:59.140
So Eddie must have
gotten through the hedges

34:59.184 --> 35:01.403
connecting the yards,
or through the gate.

35:01.447 --> 35:02.665
Either way,
he was nosing around,

35:02.709 --> 35:03.927
smelled them
and got triggered.

35:03.971 --> 35:05.146
I don't understand.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.974
Are you talking about
Eddie, Steve's dog?

35:07.017 --> 35:08.149
Is he all right?

35:08.193 --> 35:09.281
It wouldn't be a problem
if he ingested it.

35:09.324 --> 35:10.760
It's not poisonous.

35:10.804 --> 35:13.154
It-It's not that. Um,
I'm not sure if Steve told you,

35:13.198 --> 35:14.938
but Eddie was a military
working dog.

35:14.982 --> 35:16.723
He served with the Marines
in Afghanistan.

35:16.766 --> 35:19.552
These plants are
abundant there.

35:19.595 --> 35:21.902
And he suffered a combat trauma
in a field full of them.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.948
A couple days ago, Eddie's
canine PTS was triggered.

35:24.992 --> 35:29.388
And my plants were the trigger.
Oh, I feel awful.

35:29.431 --> 35:30.737
Oh, please.
How could you know?

35:30.780 --> 35:31.912
None of us did.

35:31.955 --> 35:33.696
Regardless, I will
remove these right away.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.959
I can call a few
of my students and have them

35:36.003 --> 35:38.048
help me transfer them
to the greenhouse on campus.Thank you.

35:38.092 --> 35:40.050
We appreciate your
understanding.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.748
Steve will, too.
Yeah.

35:41.791 --> 35:43.619
Oh, come on.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.493
Come on, wake up.Uh, wha--

35:47.536 --> 35:50.583
Wake up. You're okay.

35:50.626 --> 35:54.152
All right? Just breathe.
Just breathe.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.458
There you go.
That's good.

35:56.502 --> 35:58.068
All right, look,
you're stable right now

35:58.112 --> 35:59.374
and you're strong.I don't feel strong.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.767
All right? You're strong.

36:00.810 --> 36:02.769
All we gotta do is
catch a break. Okay?

36:02.812 --> 36:04.945
That's it. That all
we gotta do, all right?

36:04.988 --> 36:07.295
You cold?
I'm tired.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.210
All right. You're all right.I'm tired.
So cold.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.126
I know, I know.
I know, I know.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.084
I know.
I know.

36:14.128 --> 36:15.738
Hey, I know. Come on.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.392
Come on, won't you come on?

36:17.436 --> 36:19.002
Okay.Okay, good.

36:19.046 --> 36:20.613
Can't stay awake.Okay.

36:20.656 --> 36:24.007
Can't stay awake.
No...

36:24.051 --> 36:25.139
All right.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.228
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.143
Come o--

36:29.187 --> 36:31.145
Come on!

36:31.189 --> 36:33.103
Somebody!

36:39.458 --> 36:41.460
Come on!

36:41.503 --> 36:43.418
Come on!

36:45.507 --> 36:48.510
Wake up!
Come on!

36:48.554 --> 36:50.991
Come on!

36:57.389 --> 36:59.695
Hey.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.958
You hear that?Don't miss this one.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.628
Hey, I'm a cop.
I need to use your radio

37:19.672 --> 37:20.847
to call an ambulance.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.196
Of course.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.806
Channel nine.

37:23.850 --> 37:26.418
Is it good?
Yeah.

37:26.461 --> 37:29.508
All right, this is
Detective Danny Williams

37:29.551 --> 37:30.770
with the Five-O Task Force.

37:30.813 --> 37:33.686
I need an ambulance,
uh, Waianae Valley Road,

37:33.729 --> 37:36.732
about a mile past Haleahi.

37:36.776 --> 37:41.041
Um, got life-threatening
injuries sustained by a female.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.869
She's lost a lot of blood.
I need an ambulance immediately.

37:42.912 --> 37:44.305
DISPATCH:
Copy, Detective.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.873
Sending paramedic units
to your location right away.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.571
Right now, right now, please.
Thanks.

37:51.399 --> 37:55.273
Aw, look at you two.
Love is real.

37:55.316 --> 37:56.883
Yeah, you know, uh, I think
romcoms want us to believe

37:56.926 --> 37:58.972
that a race to the airport
tops the list

37:59.015 --> 38:00.365
of romantic gestures,

38:00.408 --> 38:03.585
but I believe that
dodging traffic has that beat.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.413
Not to mention I always thought
chasing somebody to the airport

38:05.457 --> 38:06.806
was a little psycho.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.810
You know, it's strange,
out there this morning

38:10.853 --> 38:11.854
in the traffic,

38:11.898 --> 38:13.116
where Eddie made
eye contact with me,

38:13.160 --> 38:16.294
and I could see his panic
and his fear,

38:16.337 --> 38:18.121
not knowing
which way to turn.

38:18.165 --> 38:19.688
And I swear to God,
I could relate.

38:21.647 --> 38:25.128
And after everything
that's happened this year...

38:25.172 --> 38:27.130
that's exactly
where I would be

38:27.174 --> 38:29.872
if I didn't have this dog
to lean on every day.

38:29.916 --> 38:31.483
If I didn't have all of you.

38:31.526 --> 38:32.962
Not going anywhere, Steve.

38:33.006 --> 38:34.312
Yeah, ditto.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.444
And I don't think
young Edward here

38:36.488 --> 38:38.141
is gonna be moving
for the next 18 hours.

38:38.185 --> 38:40.840
So I hope you're comfortable.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.321
By the way, um,

38:43.364 --> 38:45.018
how's Danny doing?

38:45.061 --> 38:47.455
I heard he was taking
a few days.

38:47.499 --> 38:50.328
I spoke to him this morning.
He's good.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.896
Oh, maybe that's him now.

38:53.940 --> 38:56.334
Not unless he forgot his key.

39:08.868 --> 39:10.391
Adam.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.610
Hey.

39:11.653 --> 39:13.960
It's been a minute.

39:15.701 --> 39:17.093
ADAM:
Yeah, I, uh...

39:17.137 --> 39:19.574
I'm sorry I was gone so long.

39:21.054 --> 39:24.013
I just, um...

39:24.057 --> 39:26.146
I just had to get away.

39:27.626 --> 39:28.627
Clear my head.

39:32.892 --> 39:35.024
I get it.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.896
Welcome home, bro.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.002
Hey, hey...

39:56.045 --> 39:59.353
Hey. Hey. Good news.
Ambulance is on the way.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.311
Huh?

40:01.355 --> 40:03.052
Okay? So you gotta
stay awake.

40:03.096 --> 40:04.489
All right?

40:04.532 --> 40:08.231
Okay. Okay, there you go.

40:08.275 --> 40:10.190
What's so funny?What's so funny?

40:10.233 --> 40:11.844
I got, I got the luck,
like you said.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.889
I meet the girl of my dreams,
and I get into a car accident.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.545
Ah, you're okay.

40:17.589 --> 40:19.591
Things are gonna
work out for you.

40:19.634 --> 40:22.028
Yeah. Yeah.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.466
Stay awake.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.250
Hey, you never
told me your name.

40:27.294 --> 40:29.601
My name? My name is Danny.

40:29.644 --> 40:33.605
My name's Danny. You gonna
tell me your name now?

40:34.606 --> 40:36.956
Huh?

40:41.264 --> 40:43.223
Huh?

40:43.266 --> 40:44.398
No, no.
Hey, hey.

40:49.403 --> 40:51.884
Wake up. Wake--

40:51.927 --> 40:53.015
Wake up.
