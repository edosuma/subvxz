00:05.839 --> 00:07.841
What are you doing?

00:07.925 --> 00:10.052
Wondering how to tell my roommate

00:10.135 --> 00:13.222
he drives me crazy,
without hurting his feelings.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.682
Sarcasm works better
when it's shorter.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.685
- Fascinating.
- See, there you go.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.188
So what're you doing?

00:21.271 --> 00:24.525
- You're annoying me.
- l'm OK with it.

00:24.608 --> 00:28.654
l've had such a crappy morning l decided
to come out here and eat my lunch.

00:28.737 --> 00:32.573
This spot feels secluded.
lt's so peaceful.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.535
l'm getting my spirit back.

00:34.618 --> 00:39.540
- lt's just a bench.
- Sit down, sweet thang.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:48.298 --> 00:52.135
Nice. You know, l've already eaten,
but l could...

00:52.219 --> 00:54.763
- What's it gonna take?
- Your cupcake.

00:57.015 --> 01:00.394
This is how l get my spirit back.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.609
l feel alive again.

01:14.867 --> 01:18.537
<i>It's time to change this pattern.</i>

01:18.620 --> 01:21.164
- Morning.
- How do you figure?

01:21.248 --> 01:24.209
Doing a little drilling?

01:24.293 --> 01:28.422
l have an idea. Let's go the whole day
without getting in each other's hair.

01:28.505 --> 01:32.676
Just give each other a break?
What do you say?

01:32.759 --> 01:35.179
l'm gonna give you a nickname.

01:35.262 --> 01:39.766
That's good.
l already have a nickname. lt's JD.

01:39.850 --> 01:43.937
How about... Whinyface?

01:45.189 --> 01:46.815
Whinybritches?

01:46.899 --> 01:50.736
Whinysomething.
l definitely like whiny.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.321
Whinydancer.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.467
l can't believe
l went out last night.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.636
You said you were exhausted.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.764
l was.
But l figured l owed it to the ladies.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.183
Do you ever stop giving?

02:21.266 --> 02:24.895
<i>It's hard for doctors and nurses
to be long-term friends.</i>

02:24.978 --> 02:28.857
His O2-sat's dropping.
He just needs respiratory treatment.

02:28.941 --> 02:31.860
<i>When you start out,
the nurses know more than you.</i>

02:31.944 --> 02:36.907
<i>After a few months, the training kicks
in and you both feel the dynamic shift.</i>

02:36.990 --> 02:41.828
l think because of the congestive
heart failure, he just needs Lasix.

02:44.206 --> 02:48.377
<i>The future of the relationship depends
on how she handles that very moment.</i>

02:48.460 --> 02:51.004
l'm so proud of you, Bambi.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.633
They grow up so fast.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.484
- Dr Cox.
- And there you are.

03:12.568 --> 03:16.280
- Excuse me?
- l was wondering if there's anything

03:16.363 --> 03:19.658
that could push my headache
into a full-blown migraine.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.160
And there you are.

03:22.244 --> 03:26.498
- What's the story on the admit in 64?
- She's great. l really like her.

03:26.582 --> 03:30.919
Let's see if you can't focus on things
l give a rat's ass about.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.045
What?

03:32.129 --> 03:35.007
She blacked out at work.
Accelerated heartbeat.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.383
lnteresting.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.553
l don't care if it wasn't
good first-date conversation,

03:39.636 --> 03:44.892
Michael deserved to know what
l think about circumcising babies.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.560
What? Actually, no.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.938
No, it wasn't, which is
surprising cos he's Jewish.

03:50.022 --> 03:53.609
- l gave her two Valium.
- l'm e-mailing you as we're talking.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.903
How cool is that?

03:55.986 --> 03:58.488
So she's actually sedated as we speak?

03:58.572 --> 03:59.656
OK, bye.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.992
Elliot. OK, first impressions.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.203
- Did l scare Michael off?
- No.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.289
Not if he enjoys a big fat cup of crazy.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.460
Ms Tracy, we're all busy,
so if we could...

04:11.543 --> 04:14.087
l have the same e-maily-pagey thingy.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.756
Get out!

04:18.800 --> 04:22.930
- My H sticks a little bit. Does yours?
- lt does!

04:24.556 --> 04:27.643
lt may just be a bench,
but you know what?

04:27.726 --> 04:32.064
lt's quiet. And l can chill.
lt's like my special place.

04:32.147 --> 04:35.150
You are so damn cute,
l can't even stand it.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.485
Serious?

04:36.568 --> 04:39.404
l love it that my man's
all deep and whatnot.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.698
- You know, l get deep.
- l know.

04:41.782 --> 04:45.452
- What's happening, Rerun?
- What up, Roge?

04:47.829 --> 04:49.915
How about some of this?

04:49.998 --> 04:52.543
lt wasn't even that good a show.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.087
- Take it back.
- This second.

04:55.170 --> 04:59.299
Look at the time.
Gotta go, it's lunchtime.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.843
See ya, baby!

05:00.926 --> 05:04.805
- We still on for the Bresson exhibit?
- Yes, we are.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.976
- Did you just ask out my girlfriend?
- You wanna come?

05:09.059 --> 05:12.229
Black-and-white photography,
no boobies.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.773
Hell, no.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.907
- Hello, sir.
- Nice spot.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.326
Yes, sir.

05:26.410 --> 05:30.664
l usually try to get out here
for lunch every day at 1 2.30.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.749
You don't say?

05:32.833 --> 05:36.378
Every day, 1 2.30, for 23 years.

05:39.173 --> 05:42.050
From now on, your name is Scooter.

05:42.134 --> 05:46.013
- l don't get it.
- Short for scooter pie.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.182
l hate scooter pies.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.477
Now l see.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.937
<i>You big jerk.</i>

05:54.021 --> 05:57.441
Thanks again for the invite, Bambi.
l love photography.

05:57.524 --> 06:01.445
Photography's for studs.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.659
<i>After working at a hospital for a while,
you develop a sixth sense for danger.</i>

06:07.743 --> 06:11.580
<i>Maybe there's a mass cas alert,
maybe there's a code...</i>

06:13.081 --> 06:15.167
<i>Maybe someone spent the morning</i>

06:15.250 --> 06:18.712
<i>with an annoying patient
and needs to vent.</i>

06:18.795 --> 06:20.714
<i>Luckily, I was prepared.</i>

06:22.424 --> 06:24.176
- You do your pre-rounds?
- Yes.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.929
Discharge summaries?
Pharmacy renewals?

06:27.012 --> 06:29.640
SOAP notes?
Central line changes?

06:29.723 --> 06:30.766
Yes.

06:30.849 --> 06:34.520
OK, but did you
go ahead and fix your beeper

06:34.603 --> 06:40.484
so it doesn't play that annoying
song every time you get paged?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.653
Yes.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.154
<i>Crap.</i>

06:47.491 --> 06:49.451
l expect you to act like

06:49.535 --> 06:52.621
a professional around here!

06:52.704 --> 06:55.207
ls that all you got?

06:56.333 --> 06:57.584
Good one.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.382
lnteresting titbit.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.593
Back during the gold rush
when a man staked a claim,

07:06.677 --> 07:09.471
if he came upon another man
panning his spot,

07:09.555 --> 07:12.349
he could shoot that fella dead

07:12.432 --> 07:15.394
without even asking any questions.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.230
You don't say.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.399
Simpler times.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.406
What if you've had three great dates
and he likes you so much

07:27.489 --> 07:30.659
he hasn't even tried to have sex
with you yet?

07:30.742 --> 07:33.912
l could sabotage that relationship
in two phone calls.

07:33.996 --> 07:37.499
- l could do it in one.
- Sabotage that relationship.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.419
l would ask him
why he finds me so repulsive.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.088
Then, coerce him
into having phone sex with me,

07:43.172 --> 07:46.300
then l would ask him
if he thinks we have a future,

07:46.383 --> 07:49.595
and then l'd probably just cry
until he hung up on me.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.806
- We are so alike.
- l know!

07:52.890 --> 07:55.976
''Oh, stop.'' ''No, you stop.''

07:56.059 --> 07:57.603
Oh, dear God.

07:59.730 --> 08:03.650
- Ms Tracy, we'll go ahead...
- Can you give me one sec?

08:03.734 --> 08:08.113
l'm arranging to have food delivered.
Fatty had a party and nobody came.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.324
Preaching to the choir.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.912
Think of what little patience l have

08:14.995 --> 08:18.332
as your virginity.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.627
You always thought it would
be there until that night

08:21.710 --> 08:24.213
when you were feeling down,

08:24.296 --> 08:27.216
and your pal, Kevin,
who just wanted to be friends,

08:27.299 --> 08:30.886
he dropped by and he brought
a copy of 'About Last Night'

08:30.969 --> 08:35.849
and a four-pack of Bartles & Jaymes.
And...

08:35.933 --> 08:39.977
lt was gone for ever.
Just like my patience is now.

08:40.062 --> 08:43.607
So you do scary little speeches?

08:43.690 --> 08:47.486
- How adorable!
- This is so much fun.

08:47.569 --> 08:51.615
Careful, Rapunzel.
Fun time is officially over.

08:51.698 --> 08:55.202
You think you can just treat Bambi
like that and walk away?

08:55.285 --> 08:57.704
Get him, girlfriend.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.165
What up, T-Dog?

09:00.249 --> 09:02.835
<i>The only way to avoid
the high five with Todd</i>

09:02.918 --> 09:05.963
<i>is not to say anything
that he can connect to sex.</i>

09:06.046 --> 09:08.507
How you doing?

09:08.590 --> 09:13.011
That's totally how my car was rocking
when l took this girl out last night.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.726
Am l right?

09:19.852 --> 09:21.520
<i>He earned it.</i>

09:23.397 --> 09:24.606
Pain.

09:24.690 --> 09:28.193
- So Cox tore into you?
- You know what pisses me off?

09:28.277 --> 09:30.279
No one ever calls him on anything.

09:30.362 --> 09:33.031
You want to kick and scream,

09:33.115 --> 09:37.244
that's fine, but if you ever yell
at my friend again over nothing,

09:37.327 --> 09:40.372
then l will wipe
that scary smile off your face,

09:40.455 --> 09:43.041
and keep it in my purse
until no one around here

09:43.125 --> 09:45.002
is any more scared of you than l am.

09:45.085 --> 09:49.798
lt's not fair.
Why are you eating in here?

09:49.882 --> 09:54.011
- T-man's afraid of Kelso.
- l'm not afraid of Kelso.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.305
l just felt like eating in here.

09:56.388 --> 10:00.058
Go outside and stand up for yourself.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.269
Hell, yeah.

10:04.646 --> 10:08.108
You know what else
stands up for itself?

10:08.192 --> 10:12.279
l'm not sure.
But l'll guess that it's your penis.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.906
lt is.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.490
<i>Oh, no.</i>

10:16.116 --> 10:19.870
Everyone, we can all relax now.
The planets have been realigned

10:19.953 --> 10:22.623
and order shall be returned.
Hey, you.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.876
Give me two seconds.
Gotta finish e-mailing Jill.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.670
l have
your little friend's test results.

10:28.754 --> 10:31.131
Shall we have some fun
and take a look?

10:31.215 --> 10:35.135
lnteresting. EKG, negative.
Tilt table, negative.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.596
Echo, negative.

10:37.679 --> 10:43.227
Nothing, in fact, is wrong with her
but exhaustion, brought on by...

10:43.310 --> 10:46.230
let it come... being her.

10:46.313 --> 10:50.025
- Yeah, but if you don't...
- No, no, no.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.277
There's no time for ''Yeah, buts''.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.947
l want her out of here in five minutes

10:55.030 --> 10:58.492
or you will be responsible
for covering every missed shift

10:58.575 --> 11:00.994
during this year's flu season.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.413
Now go.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.874
Hey, you...

11:05.958 --> 11:10.379
For what it's worth,
l don't care if your beeper plays

11:10.462 --> 11:13.298
<i>Who let the dogs out?
Hoof, hoof</i>

11:13.382 --> 11:16.969
- as many times as you like.
- Actually, sir, it's ''who, who''.

11:17.052 --> 11:20.931
- But thank you.
- And, by the way,

11:21.014 --> 11:24.768
just a real smooth move
running to your mommy.

11:24.852 --> 11:28.897
- Excuse me?
- Your mommy cr-rushed me.

11:28.981 --> 11:32.025
She did. l'd like to issue
a warning to everybody,

11:32.109 --> 11:34.152
and l'm dead serious.

11:34.236 --> 11:37.573
FYl: JD's mommy
has made it clear

11:37.656 --> 11:40.826
that she doesn't want her
daughter picked on any more.

11:40.909 --> 11:45.956
Nothing mean. She's a precious flower
and we should all be super nice to her.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.683
l was paged.

12:04.766 --> 12:05.976
Hello?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.978
Anyone?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.147
Oh, hell, no!

12:14.359 --> 12:16.570
When l get out, we should hang.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.572
l'd love to. l should warn you,

12:18.655 --> 12:21.783
l work a ton and when l'm off,
l catch up on paperwork

12:21.867 --> 12:25.078
or read medical journals
to stay ahead of the curve.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.580
l'm a nerd.

12:26.663 --> 12:30.501
l wish l could stay home and read,
but my job, it's like, you know?

12:30.584 --> 12:35.797
With the married-by-the-millennium
thing, l go on like, 1 ,000 blind dates.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.842
And all my friends
always need something.

12:38.926 --> 12:44.640
There's me who never wants to
let anyone down, you know, ever.

12:44.723 --> 12:50.145
With so many balls in the air, sometimes
it gets a little overwhelming.

12:51.563 --> 12:55.359
As soon as l leave, l know
l'm going right back to that mess.

12:57.694 --> 13:01.990
My God, l'm practically crying.
How pathetic is that?

13:03.534 --> 13:06.328
<i>Around here,
you make big choices every day.</i>

13:06.411 --> 13:09.039
l came to tell you
we're gonna keep you here

13:09.122 --> 13:11.291
for the weekend, just to get some rest.

13:12.626 --> 13:17.172
<i>Most of these choices actually
have nothing to do with medicine.</i>

13:17.256 --> 13:19.508
lt's so on.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.718
<i>In those cases, you have to make sure</i>

13:21.802 --> 13:24.638
<i>that your emotions
don't get the best of you.</i>

13:25.806 --> 13:27.015
<i>Mommy.</i>

13:30.394 --> 13:34.815
- Give me that, Bambi, that's not a toy.
- My name is not Bambi.

13:34.898 --> 13:38.694
lt's Dr Dorian.
l don't need to be looked after.

13:38.777 --> 13:43.574
How about l'll be the doctor
and you be the nurse.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.576
Yes, doctor.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.744
<i>Good choice.</i>

13:55.544 --> 13:58.005
l have to go check on something.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.340
<i>Fix this before word gets around.</i>

14:00.424 --> 14:01.592
Carla, wait.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.552
What did you do?

14:03.635 --> 14:08.390
- What did you do?
- What did you do?

14:08.473 --> 14:11.059
She called me Bambi
in front of everyone.

14:11.143 --> 14:14.605
- My name is not Bambi!
- lt's Scooter!

14:16.773 --> 14:18.817
Short for scooter pie.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.154
Baby, JD is my best friend,

14:22.237 --> 14:26.992
but if you need me to kick his ass,
l will kick his ass, cos l care for you.

14:27.075 --> 14:30.996
- And cos l'm willing to sleep with you.
- Hell, yeah.

14:31.079 --> 14:34.208
lf l wanted
his ass kicked l'd do it myself.

14:36.251 --> 14:37.878
Todd,

14:38.795 --> 14:41.173
if you ever make that noise at me again,

14:41.256 --> 14:44.218
l will reach into your mouth
and unscrew that bulb

14:44.301 --> 14:46.637
that barely keeps your brain going.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.808
Dude, chick threats are hot.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.102
What did l say about annoying Carla?

14:54.186 --> 14:57.940
lf she makes me choose between you two,
you know how it'll end up.

14:58.023 --> 15:01.235
Yes, l do. And l thank you for that.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.158
Could you be any cuter
with the new hair colour?

15:08.242 --> 15:11.495
Holy cow! Please, no.

15:13.372 --> 15:15.457
Good morning, sunshine.

15:16.708 --> 15:20.295
Could you possibly
excuse me for just one second?

15:23.966 --> 15:26.051
Dear God, you're still here.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.012
Who exactly is doing this to me?

15:30.305 --> 15:33.684
<i>There's nothing worse than
knowing you've wronged a friend</i>

15:33.767 --> 15:36.270
<i>and having to apologise.</i>

15:36.353 --> 15:39.439
- Look, Carla...
- lt's OK. You overreacted.

15:39.523 --> 15:42.818
l should've realised
you can stand up for yourself.

15:42.901 --> 15:46.196
l know you would take it back
if you could. l do.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.240
We're OK, right?

15:48.323 --> 15:51.910
- l think l've said all l can.
- See you tonight for the exhibit.

15:51.994 --> 15:56.331
- Why'd you have me paged?
- To ask you to forgive me.

15:56.415 --> 15:58.000
For what?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.669
Hello, sad clown.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.881
- Thanks for paging her.
- How could you?

16:03.964 --> 16:07.843
He called me cutie and said my eyes
were as blue as the ocean.

16:07.926 --> 16:10.012
l got confused.

16:11.597 --> 16:16.852
- lt probably would've worked on me too.
- You're damn right it would've. Come.

16:17.853 --> 16:19.813
ls he single?

16:19.897 --> 16:21.106
Hello?

16:21.190 --> 16:24.234
Look at you, all proud.

16:24.318 --> 16:27.070
Don't tell me
you've already managed to eat?

16:27.154 --> 16:29.031
l took my sweet time, too.

16:31.950 --> 16:35.954
Consider that your last supper.
l'm bored with the games.

16:36.038 --> 16:40.292
- Are you forbidding me to sit here?
- This is a public bench.

16:40.375 --> 16:44.463
You are as welcome here as l am
but you won't come back again.

16:44.546 --> 16:49.885
You know why? Because you
just don't have the mettle.

16:49.968 --> 16:53.639
Now get out of here so l can
eat my wife's egg salad sandwich

16:53.722 --> 16:56.725
before the tomato
soaks through the bread.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.732
Beautiful day.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.446
Did you get into photography
when you were in college or...?

17:10.531 --> 17:12.907
No. Actually, l never went to college.

17:16.118 --> 17:19.039
Don't tell any of my patients
but neither did l.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.961
ls that supposed
to make me feel better?

17:24.044 --> 17:26.588
No, it was just a joke.

17:26.672 --> 17:30.717
l was doing the whole, like,
turn a frown upside-down.

17:30.801 --> 17:34.513
You know what? Hold it.
l don't think we're OK.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.516
You accepted my apology.
You can't take it back.

17:37.599 --> 17:40.060
Have you ever spent time with a woman?

17:47.442 --> 17:52.364
ls my punishment still coming
because the anticipation is killing me?

17:52.447 --> 17:55.200
- Make your case.
- l'm sorry, what?

17:55.284 --> 17:57.703
Well, you tell me
why Chorey McCrazy Chore

17:57.786 --> 18:00.414
gets to stay here two more nights.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.999
OK.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.919
You don't know how hard it is
for some women to make it alone.

18:06.003 --> 18:09.798
Jill is so exhausted.
She's her own worst enemy.

18:09.882 --> 18:14.011
Constantly trying to please.
She judges herself harsher than anyone.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.763
Have you seen
what you look like today?

18:16.847 --> 18:19.850
l'm a skank.
She never says no to anyone, so...

18:19.933 --> 18:25.355
Could you pick up a sample of my dog's
stool and take it to the vet for me?

18:25.439 --> 18:28.150
l can do it at lunch.

18:29.985 --> 18:33.363
lt's OK.
Jill can stay a little longer.

18:33.447 --> 18:36.992
And if we're real lucky,
she'll realise that it's OK

18:37.075 --> 18:41.872
to give yourself a break
every once in a while, right?

18:52.382 --> 18:54.843
l took a cab from the last stop.

18:54.927 --> 18:57.930
- You forgot your coat.
- l don't want it.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.057
Why would you?

19:01.058 --> 19:03.143
l was only gonna go to that exhibit

19:03.227 --> 19:06.438
because l wanted you to think
l was brainy.

19:06.522 --> 19:10.025
- l'm so angry at myself.
- Thank goodness.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.152
l thought you were mad at me.

19:12.236 --> 19:16.657
Hundreds of interns have decided they
don't need me any more. Why should...?

19:16.740 --> 19:19.993
This is why you can't
be friends with doctors.

19:20.077 --> 19:23.789
lf it's a problem, you, me,
Elliot and Turk will get together...

19:23.872 --> 19:26.750
l don't work with Turk and
l'm not close to Elliot.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.878
The only problem here is you, OK?

19:31.797 --> 19:34.424
We're supposed to be friends.

19:34.508 --> 19:38.220
Your self-esteem
is so wrapped up in what you do.

19:38.303 --> 19:41.849
A doctor. That's all you are.
That's how you define yourself.

19:41.932 --> 19:44.643
You think you're
better than me because of it.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.187
- Carla, l do not think...
- Admit it.

19:47.271 --> 19:50.858
Admit it right now
or l'll never respect you again.

19:52.276 --> 19:54.695
OK. Sometimes that's true.

19:57.656 --> 20:02.119
- Carla, you're a good nurse.
- l'm a great nurse.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.163
You patronising ass.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.501
You don't even get it, do you?

20:10.502 --> 20:13.463
ln nine years, l never once
felt bad about myself

20:13.547 --> 20:16.091
for what l do, not for one second.

20:16.175 --> 20:18.552
And then l met you.

20:19.970 --> 20:22.431
- Please wait.
- Don't.

20:57.591 --> 21:00.761
<i>Sometimes the only way to
take a good look at yourself</i>

21:00.844 --> 21:03.055
<i>is through someone else's eyes.</i>

21:05.057 --> 21:08.143
<i>If you're lucky,
you'll like what you see.</i>

21:15.692 --> 21:17.653
lmpressive.

21:21.031 --> 21:23.283
<i>Or you'll learn from it.</i>

21:26.495 --> 21:28.580
<i>If you don't like what you see,</i>

21:28.664 --> 21:31.834
<i>you have to hope
you haven't burned too many bridges.</i>

21:31.917 --> 21:35.629
How many mEqs of potassium
should l give this guy?

21:35.712 --> 21:38.465
You know the answer to that.
Don't do that.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.680
But thanks, Bambi.

21:45.764 --> 21:48.767
<i>From that moment on,
I knew I'd be Bambi for ever.</i>

21:48.851 --> 21:50.936
See you tomorrow, Scooter.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.984
<i>He's actually very talented.</i>
