up with Martha.

08:07.985 --> 08:09.419
That's too bad.

WOMAN (over PA): Dr. Chan

10:50.886 --> 10:53.287
The bullet entered the maxilla,
passed through the sinus

10:53.289 --> 10:54.788
and severed the carotid artery.

10:54.790 --> 10:56.791
He's critical.

10:56.793 --> 10:59.844
He would've bled to death
if your team hadn't acted fast.

11:01.647 --> 11:06.684
How long before we know which
way the scales are tipping?

11:07.903 --> 11:12.189
We'll keep you updated as

11:14.309 --> 11:15.809
Thank you, Doctor.

11:23.318 --> 11:24.818
Is he gonna be okay?

11:24.820 --> 11:26.654
Going into surgery now.

11:26.656 --> 11:29.090
What happened out there?

11:31.760 --> 11:33.160
We're not sure.

11:33.162 --> 11:34.662
What do you mean
you're not sure?

11:34.664 --> 11:36.180
You were there,
weren't you, Mr. Callen?

11:36.182 --> 11:38.349
Did you secure
the facility?

11:38.351 --> 11:39.884
We cleared the shop
and the range.

11:39.886 --> 11:41.135
SAM:
Renko confirmed

11:41.137 --> 11:42.169
we had everyone covered.

11:42.171 --> 11:43.137
But you didn't.

11:43.139 --> 11:44.472
I mean,
obviously there were

11:44.474 --> 11:48.309
areas of vulnerability other
than the shop and the range.

11:48.311 --> 11:49.427
Hetty.

11:55.901 --> 11:59.620
I expect to see you all

11:59.622 --> 12:00.821
ASAP.

12:00.823 --> 12:01.906
Not me.

12:01.908 --> 12:02.907
Someone should

12:02.909 --> 12:04.508
stay with Renko.

12:04.510 --> 12:07.695
Yes, Miss Blye
of course you're right.

12:07.697 --> 12:10.331
DEEKS: I think maybe I
should stay with her.

12:10.333 --> 12:11.415
One agent is

12:11.417 --> 12:13.317
more than sufficient, Mr. Deeks,
thank you.

26 years old,
no criminal record.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.387
Rich Mayfield married

12:33.389 --> 12:34.705
She's been working as

12:34.707 --> 12:37.341
the bookkeeper at Point Blank

12:37.343 --> 12:38.359
Bookkeeper?

12:38.361 --> 12:39.994
Our guest in
the boat shed should

12:44.934 --> 12:47.034
Okay, Eric,
bring up the footage.

12:47.036 --> 12:50.121
Let's see if we missed anything.

12:55.510 --> 12:56.744
Is this the only camera angle?

12:56.746 --> 12:58.879
Yeah, only one security cam
in the parking area.

12:58.881 --> 13:00.715
(gunshot over speakers)

13:00.717 --> 13:03.751
ERIC: Zoom in a little.

13:04.936 --> 13:06.920
(gunshot)

13:06.922 --> 13:09.056
Well, from the angle
and the way Renko dropped,

13:09.058 --> 13:11.142
that shot had to come from
the hills somewhere.

13:11.144 --> 13:13.694
Nearest place the shooter could
have been and not been seen

13:13.696 --> 13:15.196
is at least 300,

13:15.198 --> 13:17.882
400 yards away.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.700
The shooter was trained.

13:24.656 --> 13:27.541
I was on my way
to D.C. when I heard.

13:27.543 --> 13:29.210
What happened?

13:29.212 --> 13:31.445
Why don't you ask them.

13:32.998 --> 13:34.331
Damn.

13:34.333 --> 13:39.904
Why the hell can't I access
Agent Renko's case file?

13:45.794 --> 13:47.645
You were his handler.

13:47.647 --> 13:52.683
I still like to keep my hand
on the tiller once in a while.

13:56.721 --> 13:58.022
Oh...

13:58.024 --> 14:00.024
But as assistant director,

14:00.026 --> 14:03.828
the agency tends to take a
dim view on that sort of thing.

14:03.830 --> 14:06.697
So you covered your ass.

14:06.699 --> 14:08.199
Mm.

14:08.201 --> 14:11.118
It seemed like the prudent
thing to do, considering.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.703
What was Renko working?

14:15.990 --> 14:20.878
We got a tip that Rich
Mayfield's operation was dirty.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.464
That he might be selling
assault rifles to a middle man

14:23.466 --> 14:26.767
who was gonna turn them around
to a homegrown terrorist cell.

14:26.769 --> 14:28.886
Did the tip pan out?

14:28.888 --> 14:30.221
Renko was only under
three weeks.

14:30.223 --> 14:31.605
He was still
gaining Rich's trust.

14:31.607 --> 14:33.691
But he did allude
to a special client

14:33.693 --> 14:35.976
he was gonna be
taking care of soon.

14:35.978 --> 14:37.978
And the sale is still pending?

14:37.980 --> 14:40.114
It was supposed to go down
in the next day or two.

14:40.116 --> 14:42.700
We don't know anything
else about the buyer.

14:42.702 --> 14:45.653
He was gonna text Rich
with a time and a place.

14:45.655 --> 14:47.621
But maybe he's

14:47.623 --> 14:49.990
still in the dark about
what happened today.

14:49.992 --> 14:52.660
We had information
that made us believe

14:52.662 --> 14:57.364
that Agent Renko's cover
was in jeopardy.

14:57.366 --> 14:59.884
Would you have preferred
that we let that play out

14:59.886 --> 15:01.535
for the sake
of the investigation?

15:01.537 --> 15:03.087
Of course not.

15:03.089 --> 15:06.090
But it didn't change
the outcome, did it?

15:06.092 --> 15:08.876
You were his handler.

15:08.878 --> 15:10.928
Why weren't you handling him?

15:10.930 --> 15:13.481
I told you,
I was on my way to D.C.

15:13.483 --> 15:15.649
There was an urgent situation.

15:15.651 --> 15:17.067
A little advice,

15:17.069 --> 15:18.686
Assistant Director.

15:18.688 --> 15:24.625
The next time you feel the urge
to put your hand on the tiller,

15:24.627 --> 15:26.110
it might be prudent

15:26.112 --> 15:28.662
to actually keep your hand
on the tiller.

15:28.664 --> 15:34.351
Otherwise, the ship
tends to veer off course.

15:42.210 --> 15:44.378
WOMAN: Blood pressure is 120/80.

15:47.465 --> 15:49.683
(indistinct PA announcement)

15:54.022 --> 15:55.523
Mr. Renko's still in surgery,

15:55.525 --> 15:57.391
but it's going better
than we hoped.

15:57.393 --> 15:59.860
He's not completely out
of danger, but he should

15:59.862 --> 16:00.978
be in recovery soon.

16:00.980 --> 16:03.764
Thank you very much.

16:05.784 --> 16:07.318
(phone ringing nearby)

16:09.120 --> 16:13.040
WOMAN (over PA): Dr. Kaiser to Radiology.
Dr. Kaiser to Radiology.

16:14.543 --> 16:16.610
California EDD records
indicate there are

16:16.612 --> 16:18.862
two other employees
at Point Blank.

16:18.864 --> 16:20.664
From the security cam
footage,

16:20.666 --> 16:23.467
neither appeared to be
at work when Renko was shot.

16:23.469 --> 16:24.752
Paul Manning
was arrested

16:24.754 --> 16:27.621
yesterday by LAPD for DUI.

16:27.623 --> 16:29.590
He's still in holding
at County downtown.

16:29.592 --> 16:31.592
ERIC:
And Walter Henderson, 32--

16:31.594 --> 16:34.094
arrests for assault,
robbery, grand theft

16:34.096 --> 16:36.480
and illegal
firearms possession.

16:36.482 --> 16:37.598
A real Renaissance man.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.999
ERIC:
And here's the kicker.

16:39.001 --> 16:41.735
While in the Army, he was
enrolled in the sniper school

16:41.737 --> 16:43.303
at Fort Benning,
Georgia.

16:43.305 --> 16:44.488
NELL:
But he washed out.

16:44.490 --> 16:45.889
He received
a bad conduct discharge

16:45.891 --> 16:47.191
for multiple counts of

16:47.193 --> 16:48.809
insubordination
and assault.

16:48.811 --> 16:50.778
A Renaissance man
with anger issues.

16:50.780 --> 16:52.646
Angry 'cause he knew
Renko was a cop?

16:52.648 --> 16:54.648
Maybe.

16:54.650 --> 16:56.116
We have a bead on this guy?

16:56.118 --> 16:57.751
ERIC: Last known address
was in Burbank.

16:57.753 --> 16:59.152
Evicted two months ago.

16:59.154 --> 17:00.821
No forwarding.

17:00.823 --> 17:02.206
Contact local
law enforcement.

17:02.208 --> 17:05.342
Tell them to put out
an APB on Mr. Henderson.

17:05.344 --> 17:07.211
CALLEN: Eric, run a scan
for facial rec hits

17:07.213 --> 17:08.429
and credit card activity.

17:08.431 --> 17:10.431
On it.

17:11.633 --> 17:12.549
You got something on your mind?

17:12.550 --> 17:14.602
Lots, Agent Callen.

17:14.604 --> 17:16.920
Lots.

17:20.191 --> 17:22.026
(sighs)

17:26.698 --> 17:28.565
(alarm beeping)

17:28.567 --> 17:30.284
Systolic down to 78.

17:30.286 --> 17:32.620
Get him down to 100%,
non-rebreather.

17:32.622 --> 17:33.537
Pulse 130 and thready.

17:33.539 --> 17:34.571
Doctor, w-what's
going on?

17:34.573 --> 17:35.572
We got it handled.

17:35.574 --> 17:36.824
BP 78/56.

17:36.826 --> 17:37.908
Give him two
liters of saline.

17:37.910 --> 17:39.209
Set up for
ultrasound.

17:39.211 --> 17:40.861
Running a 12-lead.

17:40.863 --> 17:42.496
Pulse ox up to
82 on 100%.

17:42.498 --> 17:45.165
(indistinct, overlapping
conversation)

17:45.167 --> 17:46.467
Soon as he stabilizes,

17:46.469 --> 17:49.586
prep for a central line to
draw 50 of tenecteplase.

17:49.588 --> 17:51.204
SAM:
<i>Seems like some of</i>

17:51.206 --> 17:53.724
the murders are connected and
others aren't connected at all.

17:53.726 --> 17:56.376
DEEKS: Maybe whoever was shooting
had a plan when they started.

17:56.378 --> 17:58.145
Then they got a taste for it

17:58.147 --> 18:00.347
and the plan
didn't matter anymore.

18:00.349 --> 18:01.882
So the killings became random.

18:01.884 --> 18:03.434
Maybe.

18:03.436 --> 18:05.052
But I don't think so.

18:05.054 --> 18:05.953
Why?

18:05.955 --> 18:08.739
I wish I knew.

18:08.741 --> 18:10.791
(phone ringing)

18:12.610 --> 18:14.445
Yeah.

18:14.447 --> 18:16.497
Yeah, she's right here.

18:21.419 --> 18:22.619
Hello.

18:22.621 --> 18:24.254
CALLEN: Something in my
gut tells me

18:24.256 --> 18:25.572
there's more
going on here.

18:25.574 --> 18:28.208
Yes, Miss Blye.

18:28.210 --> 18:32.245
CALLEN: This case is complicated--
almost too complicated.

18:32.247 --> 18:34.548
(murmuring): There's something
that we're missing.

18:34.550 --> 18:35.749
Something
simple...

18:35.751 --> 18:37.935
Thank you.

18:45.977 --> 18:48.429
Hetty?

18:54.986 --> 18:56.453
Agent Renko...

18:56.455 --> 18:57.771
(clears throat)

18:57.773 --> 19:02.442
...had a cardiac arrest
right after surgery.

19:04.462 --> 19:07.898
There was nothing
they could do for him.

19:39.707 --> 19:41.508
You decorate this
yourselves

19:41.510 --> 19:44.911
or did you bring in
Extreme Makeover: Home Edition?

19:49.300 --> 19:52.636
Hal's a cop, isn't he?

19:52.638 --> 19:55.539
Hal's name was
NCIS Special Agent Mike Renko.

19:55.541 --> 19:58.692
CALLEN: And he's dead
now, Mara.

19:58.694 --> 20:01.678
Shouldn't take you long to
decorate a cell at Valley State.

20:01.680 --> 20:04.197
SAM: I'm sure you
could try

20:04.199 --> 20:07.200
many different styles
over the next 20 years.

20:07.202 --> 20:09.403
Here's the deal, Mara...

20:09.405 --> 20:12.322
They're never gonna
make her talk.

20:12.324 --> 20:14.023
Dysfunctional, militant
family like that--

20:14.025 --> 20:16.460
she'll go to jail
out of spite.

20:16.462 --> 20:17.961
Listen, I
know I didn't

20:17.963 --> 20:19.195
know Renko as
well as you guys,

20:19.197 --> 20:21.048
but if you want to talk
about it, I can...

20:21.050 --> 20:22.999
I think that it's best if
we focus on the interrogation.

20:23.001 --> 20:24.051
Right, of course.

20:24.053 --> 20:26.336
I'm just saying
that if it's...

20:27.505 --> 20:29.389
Of course.

20:29.391 --> 20:31.641
CALLEN:
So what's it gonna be?

20:31.643 --> 20:33.009
I need a smoke.

20:33.011 --> 20:35.512
No. What you need to do is help
us with this investigation.

20:35.514 --> 20:38.315
SAM: A federal agent
has been murdered.

20:38.317 --> 20:40.233
You have any idea how much
trouble you could be in?

20:40.235 --> 20:41.902
I didn't have anything
to do with that.

20:41.904 --> 20:42.686
Then help us.

20:42.688 --> 20:44.855
Did I ever say I wouldn't?

20:50.728 --> 20:52.395
(sighs)

20:54.248 --> 20:57.567
Accounting files on my computer
go back to 2003.

20:57.569 --> 20:59.336
There are handwritten
ledgers before that

20:59.338 --> 21:02.672
when Rich opened
the place in '98.

21:02.674 --> 21:05.208
On the surface,
everything looks legit,

21:05.210 --> 21:06.109
but it's not.

21:06.111 --> 21:07.461
What are we
talking about?

21:07.463 --> 21:08.678
Receipts and invoices.

21:08.680 --> 21:12.132
I'd say at least 15% are fudged.

21:12.134 --> 21:13.350
SAM:
Will you walk us

21:13.352 --> 21:14.217
through the paperwork?

21:14.219 --> 21:15.435
Sure, but you probably

21:15.437 --> 21:16.803
won't need much help.

21:16.805 --> 21:19.356
Snooki could tell you
something's wonky.

21:19.358 --> 21:21.525
Rich thought he was
some kind of

21:21.527 --> 21:23.092
criminal mastermind.

21:23.094 --> 21:24.478
He was a moron.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.096
You didn't approve
when your mom married him.

21:27.098 --> 21:30.817
She made a lot of
dumb choices in her life.

21:30.819 --> 21:33.436
Marrying Rich
was top of the list.

21:33.438 --> 21:35.122
She wasn't exactly

21:35.124 --> 21:38.708
a charter member of Mensa, but
compared to those inbred idiots,

21:38.710 --> 21:40.827
she was frickin'
Stephen Hawking.

21:40.829 --> 21:42.746
And you worked for them.

21:42.748 --> 21:44.331
I didn't know anything was wrong
until I started.

21:44.333 --> 21:45.715
But you stayed anyway.

21:45.717 --> 21:49.803
I've got a kid,
an upside-down mortgage

21:49.805 --> 21:53.056
and health insurance bills
that run a grand a month.

21:53.058 --> 21:54.925
Rich paid more than
anyone else would have.

21:54.927 --> 21:56.760
He paid you
to keep your mouth shut.

21:56.762 --> 21:58.178
And I did.

21:58.180 --> 22:01.531
Then I guess he wasn't
as big of an idiot as you say.

22:04.685 --> 22:06.820
Rich confided in Renko
that he was worried

22:06.822 --> 22:09.322
there was a bad apple
among his people.

22:09.324 --> 22:11.140
Someone who could
bring them down.

22:11.142 --> 22:12.108
Did Renko believe

22:12.110 --> 22:13.276
he was being baited?

22:13.278 --> 22:15.278
He didn't think so.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.446
His family--

22:16.448 --> 22:19.099
have they been informed?

22:20.368 --> 22:22.452
My office is handling it.

22:22.454 --> 22:23.753
Did you get anything

22:23.755 --> 22:24.871
off Rich Mayfield's cell?

22:24.873 --> 22:26.706
Excuse me.

22:26.708 --> 22:28.375
Your office is what?

22:30.211 --> 22:32.679
I made the call myself, Hetty.

22:32.681 --> 22:35.098
Now, if it's not

22:35.100 --> 22:37.133
too inconvenient...

22:37.135 --> 22:39.436
ERIC:
Um, well, there...

22:39.438 --> 22:42.338
Mayfield got a text on his cell
this morning from the buyer.

22:42.340 --> 22:44.608
The deal is supposed
to happen soon.

22:44.610 --> 22:46.175
Any indication where?

22:46.177 --> 22:47.194
No.

22:47.196 --> 22:49.178
And I wasn't able
to trace the cell.

22:49.180 --> 22:51.114
It seems like
it's a burn phone.

22:51.116 --> 22:52.816
(tablet beeps)
Whoever it belongs to

22:52.818 --> 22:54.367
disabled the
GPS tracking.

22:54.369 --> 22:56.203
So we're in the dark.
ERIC: Whoa.

22:56.205 --> 22:58.405
Someone may have just
turned a light on.

22:58.407 --> 23:01.074
Walter Henderson, our missing
Point Blank employee,

23:01.076 --> 23:04.461
just used his credit card to
rent a motel room in Sun Valley.

23:07.248 --> 23:09.132
SAM:
I don't think so.

23:10.668 --> 23:13.837
I'm helping you take down
an illegal gun operation

23:13.839 --> 23:16.423
and you're gonna go
all Rob Reiner on me? Serious?

23:16.425 --> 23:19.593
(cell phone ringing)

23:19.595 --> 23:21.228
Yeah, Eric?

23:21.230 --> 23:22.762
Henderson just used his
credit card to rent a motel.

23:22.764 --> 23:25.432
All right, send me the details
on the location.

23:25.434 --> 23:27.884
We just got a lead on
Point Blank's missing employee,

23:27.886 --> 23:29.352
Walter Henderson.

23:29.354 --> 23:32.606
What do we need to know
about him?

23:32.608 --> 23:34.223
Besides being
a first-class douche,

23:34.225 --> 23:38.227
Walter is not exactly the
poster boy for mental health.

23:38.229 --> 23:40.247
Bipolar,
doesn't take his meds.

23:40.249 --> 23:42.532
Another great combination, huh?

23:42.534 --> 23:46.119
Said he didn't like
the way they "made him feel."

23:46.121 --> 23:48.255
Never mind how it made
anyone else feel

23:48.257 --> 23:49.539
when he was off them.

23:49.541 --> 23:50.540
Like he could snap

23:50.542 --> 23:51.575
at any time.

23:51.577 --> 23:52.842
He'd be happy
and joking

23:52.844 --> 23:55.244
one minute,
then fly into a rage

23:55.246 --> 23:58.798
and beat the crap out of
the filing cabinet, copier.

23:58.800 --> 24:02.052
Really made the customers feel
at ease in a store full of guns.

24:02.054 --> 24:04.087
He had sniper training.

24:04.089 --> 24:05.272
Washed out

24:05.274 --> 24:06.706
'cause he couldn't
hack the math.

24:07.858 --> 24:09.258
He was a damned good shot.

24:09.260 --> 24:10.860
Saw him at the range myself.

24:11.779 --> 24:13.363
Had no problem doing

24:13.365 --> 24:14.731
anything Rich told him to.

24:14.733 --> 24:15.982
And word was

24:15.984 --> 24:19.319
that Rich had him do
some really nasty stuff.

24:25.293 --> 24:28.261
Not that I'm sure
it matters to you...

24:29.413 --> 24:31.998
...I really liked Hal.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.718
He was different
from the rest.

24:40.675 --> 24:42.225
(door closes)

24:46.130 --> 24:48.181
MAN:
Oh, I hear you.

24:48.183 --> 24:49.733
But that's just politics,
ain't it?

24:49.735 --> 24:52.602
I mean, you can't trust
any of them, if you ask me.

24:52.604 --> 24:53.987
(clears throat)

24:53.989 --> 24:55.638
Well, 65 a night.

24:55.640 --> 24:58.241
Or 30 for an hour.

24:59.827 --> 25:02.812
Oh. I got to go.

25:02.814 --> 25:04.698
Yeah?

25:04.700 --> 25:06.166
This man.

25:06.168 --> 25:07.650
Oh.

25:07.652 --> 25:09.786
Room 22, second floor.

25:09.788 --> 25:12.589
The guy's a friggin' psycho.

25:12.591 --> 25:15.425
Case you haven't noticed, this
ain't exactly the Four Seasons.

25:15.427 --> 25:16.760
Even for this place,

25:16.762 --> 25:18.378
guy's a friggin' psycho.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.296
You want to
explain that?

25:20.298 --> 25:21.330
Well, he-he's nervous.

25:21.332 --> 25:22.682
He's on edge.

25:22.684 --> 25:25.835
I-I don't know if it's
drug nervous or PTSD nervous

25:25.837 --> 25:27.837
or just nervous nervous,
but the guy's a...

25:27.839 --> 25:29.839
BOTH: A friggin' psycho.
Mm-hmm.

25:29.841 --> 25:32.225
Room have a back way out?
Window.

25:32.227 --> 25:33.843
You might want to stay inside.

25:33.845 --> 25:35.362
No arguments here.

25:35.364 --> 25:37.113
Key.
Mm?

25:37.115 --> 25:38.181
To the room.

25:38.183 --> 25:40.183
Oh.

25:40.185 --> 25:42.035
Sure, sure.

25:42.037 --> 25:44.320
DEEKS: It's gonna be hard for you
to believe, Kens,

25:44.322 --> 25:46.189
but this is actually
one motel that I have

25:46.191 --> 25:47.207
no prior
experience with.

25:47.209 --> 25:48.524
Yep. Never been here

25:48.526 --> 25:52.528
for an undercover op or
an under-the-cover op--

25:52.530 --> 25:54.697
which is actually much more
fun for all parties involved.

25:54.699 --> 25:56.249
But it's kind of
amazing, really...

25:56.251 --> 25:57.250
Deeks.

25:57.252 --> 25:58.218
Sorry.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.536
I have a tendency
of using comedy

26:00.538 --> 26:01.921
to diffuse tension
in situations...

26:01.923 --> 26:03.640
Shut up, Deeks.
All right.

26:06.477 --> 26:08.878
And thank you.

26:11.515 --> 26:13.817
Manager says Henderson's second-
floor room has a rear window.

26:13.819 --> 26:16.569
Why don't you two cover the back
in case he's crazy enough to jump.

26:16.571 --> 26:18.271
On it.

26:35.423 --> 26:37.740
(lock beeps)

26:37.742 --> 26:39.408
Federal agents!

26:42.179 --> 26:43.246
Sam.

26:43.248 --> 26:45.381
G.

26:49.386 --> 26:51.554
Head shot.

26:55.192 --> 26:57.393
(sirens wailing in distance)

27:14.159 --> 27:15.791
He's gone into rigor.

27:15.792 --> 27:17.727
He must have been shot
right after he checked in.

27:17.729 --> 27:19.846
Which means the shooter
is long gone.

27:19.848 --> 27:22.148
Any number of buildings that
shot could've come from.

27:22.150 --> 27:23.599
Sniper shoots sniper.

27:23.601 --> 27:27.887
Let's say Henderson
shot Earl Mayfield and Renko.

27:27.889 --> 27:30.156
Everyone knows
he's unstable.

27:30.158 --> 27:31.607
So Rich has
someone else make sure

27:31.609 --> 27:34.110
he doesn't go blabbing
about it in his manic phase.

27:34.112 --> 27:35.778
Except we took out Rich
before this went down.

27:35.780 --> 27:37.163
He could've ordered
the hit before.

27:37.165 --> 27:38.781
DEEKS: I'm having two
random thoughts,

27:38.783 --> 27:40.533
first of which is the movie
Enemy at the Gates

27:40.535 --> 27:41.668
with the two snipers

27:41.670 --> 27:43.453
that try to shoot--
That's not important.

27:43.455 --> 27:44.704
I digress.

27:44.706 --> 27:47.674
Secondly, does anyone else smell
the proverbial rat?

27:47.676 --> 27:50.259
Mara said these guys
weren't geniuses,

27:50.261 --> 27:53.529
but this doesn't make sense,
even for them.

27:58.018 --> 28:00.553
t's assume that Ballistics
will show that the bullet

28:00.555 --> 28:02.972
that killed Walter Henderson
matches those

28:02.974 --> 28:06.642
that shot Earl Mayfield
and Renko.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.594
So Rich thought his employee,
Conrad Weaver,

28:08.596 --> 28:12.398
was the bad apple, so he sends
his nephew, Earl, to kill him.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.584
Only, Earl had information
on his cell phone

28:14.586 --> 28:18.321
that suggested that Mr. Renko
was the bad apple.

28:18.323 --> 28:19.605
Which doesn't make much sense,

28:19.607 --> 28:21.791
but it is motive
for two of the shootings.

28:21.793 --> 28:23.876
Well, if it is the same gun,
it's most likely the same person

28:23.878 --> 28:26.546
who killed all of them.
So then it would make sense

28:26.548 --> 28:28.965
that someone outside of
the Mayfield organization

28:28.967 --> 28:31.551
was responsible
for all three shootings.

28:31.553 --> 28:33.152
Or maybe Renko wasn't shot

28:33.154 --> 28:35.738
because Mayfield suspected
his cover was fake.

28:35.740 --> 28:38.358
Maybe there was another reason.

28:39.393 --> 28:41.144
HETTY:
We know for a fact

28:41.146 --> 28:45.481
that Rich Mayfield was ready
to shoot Mr. Renko himself.

28:45.483 --> 28:47.633
So who has a motive
outside of Point Blank

28:47.635 --> 28:48.818
for the three shootings?

28:48.820 --> 28:51.404
Someone with a grudge
against the Mayfields.

28:51.406 --> 28:53.022
Well, if you're in
the illegal weapons business,

28:53.024 --> 28:55.525
your list of potential enemies
is bound to be a long one.

28:55.527 --> 28:56.526
(tablet beeps)

28:56.528 --> 28:57.527
ERIC:
A text just came

28:57.529 --> 28:58.611
into Rich
Mayfield's cell.

28:58.613 --> 29:01.197
It's our buyer.

29:01.199 --> 29:03.482
He's got a time and place
for the deal: East L.A.

29:03.484 --> 29:05.101
four hours from now.

29:05.103 --> 29:07.370
Well, we need to make that meet.

29:07.372 --> 29:10.139
He's gonna want to see the
weapons before he makes payment.

29:10.141 --> 29:11.791
Only, we don't know
what they are.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.846
My guess is that he was
going to sell him AR-15s.

29:16.848 --> 29:19.048
Two dozen were sold
over a three-week period

29:19.050 --> 29:20.183
to various individuals.

29:20.185 --> 29:21.968
Individuals who probably
don't even exist.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.553
We're lucky to sell one a month.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.438
The receipts are in
Rich's handwriting.

29:25.440 --> 29:28.724
I've seen him work the
counter maybe twice.

29:28.726 --> 29:30.309
Okay, well,
if the sales were bogus

29:30.311 --> 29:32.845
and Rich didn't know when
the deal was gonna go down...

29:32.847 --> 29:34.346
He hid them.

29:34.348 --> 29:35.648
KENSI:
Yeah.

29:35.650 --> 29:36.816
So where'd Richie boy hide them?

29:36.818 --> 29:38.184
There's a gun vault,

29:38.186 --> 29:40.286
but even he wouldn't be
stupid enough to put them there.

29:40.288 --> 29:41.237
CALLEN:
Any unusual activity

29:41.239 --> 29:43.456
at the shop
or here at the range?

29:43.458 --> 29:44.490
Maintenance? Construction?

29:44.492 --> 29:45.741
A few weeks ago,

29:45.743 --> 29:46.959
there was some kind of problem

29:46.961 --> 29:48.961
with the backstop
on one of the firing lanes.

29:48.963 --> 29:51.464
Rich usually has
one of the guys

29:51.466 --> 29:53.049
take care of that stuff.

29:53.051 --> 29:54.684
This time, he did it himself.

29:59.506 --> 30:03.542
I don't know which is the
greater Henrietta Lange legend,

30:03.544 --> 30:05.711
her obsession with exotic teas

30:05.713 --> 30:08.431
or her capacity
for single malts.

30:10.383 --> 30:14.220
I need to know
what's going on, Owen.

30:14.222 --> 30:16.489
You were on your way
to Washington.

30:16.491 --> 30:20.993
Must have been important
for you to leave an active op.

30:22.663 --> 30:23.779
Yeah, it was.

30:23.781 --> 30:25.832
There's a problem
with one of our agents.

30:27.668 --> 30:28.951
Is it one of mine?

30:28.953 --> 30:31.003
I can't tell you
more than that, Hetty.

30:31.005 --> 30:33.956
There was a time...

30:33.958 --> 30:37.376
when you would've
told me everything.

30:37.378 --> 30:40.680
Well, that was
a long time ago.

30:40.682 --> 30:43.049
And we were
different then.

30:43.051 --> 30:45.584
I miss those times.

30:47.304 --> 30:50.806
I don't think
you miss those times, Owen.

30:50.808 --> 30:55.528
I don't think
you miss them at all.

31:17.784 --> 31:19.168
Here.

31:19.170 --> 31:20.920
It's loose.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.739
Got something.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.019
Phew.

31:37.021 --> 31:41.190
Well, in the words of
Monty Hall, let's make a deal.

31:43.827 --> 31:46.696
The buyer wants you to
meet in that parking lot.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.331
Which makes us sitting ducks
if that sniper

31:48.333 --> 31:50.333
is on that bridge
or any of those buildings.

31:50.335 --> 31:53.035
Which is why I'm sending in
teams to sweep them

31:53.037 --> 31:55.504
and posting our own snipers.

31:55.506 --> 31:57.489
He spots us and gets spooked,
we might never find him.

31:57.491 --> 31:58.708
HETTY:
You think the alternative

31:58.710 --> 32:01.510
is worth another one
of our agents being killed?

32:01.512 --> 32:04.046
We don't know that the buyer
is the sniper.

32:04.048 --> 32:05.197
CALLEN:
At this point,

32:05.199 --> 32:06.899
we don't know
what we don't know.

32:07.834 --> 32:08.801
Do we?

32:08.803 --> 32:09.802
HETTY:
This is not

32:09.804 --> 32:10.953
up for debate, Owen.

32:10.955 --> 32:16.242
Either our sniper team goes in
or no one does.

32:22.783 --> 32:24.967
All right.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.354
KENSI:
The parking lot is wide open.

32:28.356 --> 32:31.357
There's no way our sniper team
can cover every single angle.

32:31.359 --> 32:32.875
Got to take our chances.

32:32.877 --> 32:35.261
Just like Renko.

32:51.812 --> 32:53.763
ERIC: Teams have cleared
the surrounding buildings.

32:53.765 --> 32:56.015
Snipers are taking
rooftop positions.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.337
I see three.

33:32.853 --> 33:34.586
Hey, you Rich?

33:34.588 --> 33:37.023
Yeah.

33:37.025 --> 33:38.691
I'm Jeff.

33:39.426 --> 33:40.976
Brent and Ari.

33:40.978 --> 33:44.263
Carlo told us to help you
guys unload the crates.

33:44.265 --> 33:46.232
He's gonna pull the truck up
in a couple minutes--

33:46.234 --> 33:47.783
just went to get
some Starbucks.

33:47.785 --> 33:48.901
Starbucks.

33:48.903 --> 33:50.152
Yeah.

33:50.154 --> 33:52.771
Sorry.

33:52.773 --> 33:55.007
Should've asked if you guys
wanted anything.

33:56.443 --> 33:59.378
I think we've
just been had.

34:15.212 --> 34:17.463
Look, we just haul stuff
to make some extra cash.

34:17.465 --> 34:19.114
Put an ad on
Craigslist,

34:19.117 --> 34:21.918
this guy Carlo wanted us to
help him with a couple crates.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.219
Picked us up
in his truck.

34:23.221 --> 34:24.637
Then he went to Starbucks.
Yeah.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.956
I mean, that's
what he said.

34:26.958 --> 34:28.675
Is it drugs?

34:28.677 --> 34:30.844
It's drugs, isn't it?

34:30.846 --> 34:32.344
(sighs)

34:32.347 --> 34:34.179
We didn't know!

34:34.181 --> 34:35.797
Hey, look, I'll be
straight up with you.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.400
Campus cops wrote me up for
some weed, but I have a card.

34:38.402 --> 34:40.770
That's it, I swear.

34:40.772 --> 34:42.021
Eric.

34:42.023 --> 34:43.973
ERIC: All three are students
at community college.

34:43.975 --> 34:45.324
No criminal records.

34:45.327 --> 34:47.527
Jeff Foster was cited
by campus security

34:47.529 --> 34:50.313
for smoking marijuana on campus,
though he has a medical card.

34:50.315 --> 34:53.565
Low-level anxiety disorder,
early onset arthritis

34:53.568 --> 34:55.918
and foreign accent syndrome.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.003
Impressive.

34:57.005 --> 34:58.487
They said the guy
that hired them

34:58.489 --> 35:00.089
was driving
a rental moving truck.

35:00.091 --> 35:01.257
Where the hell is he?

35:01.259 --> 35:02.375
ERIC:
We're on it.

35:05.462 --> 35:07.096
NELL:
Got him.

35:07.098 --> 35:10.016
A half hour ago,
parked on Northview,

35:10.018 --> 35:12.268
two blocks from the parking lot.

35:12.270 --> 35:14.170
Can you see the driver?

35:15.773 --> 35:18.441
Barely. I can't really make out
what he looks like.

35:18.443 --> 35:19.692
Either this guy's

35:19.694 --> 35:22.562
really lucky or he knew
exactly where the camera was.

35:24.114 --> 35:27.533
Nell, where was
Earl Mayfield shot?

35:27.535 --> 35:29.452
Where specifically on his body?

35:29.454 --> 35:31.821
Coroner's report states
the right mandible.

35:31.823 --> 35:33.873
The jaw.

35:33.875 --> 35:35.191
What about Henderson?

35:35.193 --> 35:36.192
Same.

35:36.194 --> 35:37.193
And Renko?

35:37.195 --> 35:38.194
Upper jaw.

35:38.196 --> 35:40.380
All three shot in the mouth.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.801
You the cop who shot me?

35:45.970 --> 35:47.203
Don't shoot at me next time.

35:47.205 --> 35:49.489
The bullet is still in my head.

35:49.491 --> 35:51.691
My mouth doesn't work.

35:53.710 --> 35:55.478
Either this guy's really lucky

35:55.480 --> 35:57.931
or he knew exactly
where the camera was.

35:59.133 --> 36:00.900
I'm just the driver.

36:00.902 --> 36:02.552
Picked us up
in his truck.

36:03.921 --> 36:06.489
MAN:
Agent G. Callen,

36:06.491 --> 36:09.509
I know where you work,
I know where you live,

36:09.511 --> 36:11.594
I know who you care about.

36:11.596 --> 36:13.896
One day, I'm going to kill you.

36:13.898 --> 36:15.999
Soon.

36:16.001 --> 36:17.400
That's all I live for.

36:17.402 --> 36:21.387
It's all I care about.

36:24.258 --> 36:26.242
(computer beeps)

36:26.244 --> 36:30.046
Guys, our buyer just turned
the GPS on his phone back on.

36:30.048 --> 36:32.632
Lucky break.

36:34.969 --> 36:36.585
No.

36:36.587 --> 36:37.937
No, he did it
on purpose.

36:37.939 --> 36:40.640
He wants us to find him.

36:40.642 --> 36:41.691
Who?

36:41.693 --> 36:44.027
The Chameleon.

36:45.396 --> 36:47.063
It's been him all along.

36:47.065 --> 36:49.699
Where is he, Eric?

36:52.703 --> 36:55.204
Left out of the parking
lot, three blocks.

36:55.206 --> 36:56.789
Pulling up pictometry.

36:56.791 --> 36:59.826
All right, looks like
some sort of industrial area.

36:59.828 --> 37:02.161
First gate, turn right.

37:03.797 --> 37:06.799
ERIC:
400 yards and closing.

37:21.065 --> 37:24.751
DEEKS:
Looks like a DOT dumping ground.

37:26.487 --> 37:29.322
You good?

37:32.159 --> 37:33.659
Yeah.

37:33.661 --> 37:35.762
All right.

37:37.998 --> 37:39.665
100 yards directly
in front of you,

37:39.667 --> 37:41.250
you should see him any second.

37:45.089 --> 37:47.006
Got him.

38:08.278 --> 38:10.797
Just a cell phone.

38:11.982 --> 38:14.951
What the hell is he doing?

38:16.036 --> 38:17.487
(cell phone ringing)

38:17.489 --> 38:19.539
I need to take this.

38:19.541 --> 38:20.656
Put the phone down

38:20.658 --> 38:21.741
now!

38:21.743 --> 38:25.962
You need me to take this,
Agent Callen.

38:28.132 --> 38:29.132
(cell phone beeps)

38:29.134 --> 38:31.551
WOMAN (screams):
Callen!

38:33.337 --> 38:34.971
Help me!

38:34.973 --> 38:37.974
(woman panting)

38:45.715 --> 38:47.266
What is it?

38:47.268 --> 38:49.435
Pulling it up.

38:54.908 --> 38:56.676
There's someone in it.

38:58.579 --> 39:00.363
It can't be.

39:00.365 --> 39:02.281
Dear God.

39:02.283 --> 39:03.950
It's Hunter.

39:08.905 --> 39:10.923
Help me!

39:12.742 --> 39:16.512
I guess you don't want
to talk to her after all.

39:17.681 --> 39:20.183
(panting)

39:20.185 --> 39:22.185
So be it.

39:22.187 --> 39:24.303

40:20.765 --> 40:22.933
Angry?

40:27.823 --> 40:30.358
Not angry.

40:30.360 --> 40:33.528
Well, I have to admit, I am
more than a little pissed.

40:33.530 --> 40:35.730
This wasn't supposed
to happen to me.

40:35.732 --> 40:38.249
I never promised you
that it wouldn't.

40:38.251 --> 40:40.451
Doesn't make
you guilt-free.

40:40.453 --> 40:42.453
No, it doesn't.

40:42.455 --> 40:45.306
Gives you something
to cling onto, though.

40:47.843 --> 40:51.713
A slippery rock
in a rising tide.

40:52.564 --> 40:56.601
If not angry, then what?

40:56.603 --> 40:59.253
I feel like I'm drowning.

40:59.255 --> 41:03.141
Beats being blown up.

41:03.143 --> 41:04.309
What am I?

41:05.144 --> 41:07.312
The fourth.

41:07.314 --> 41:09.314
There are more
on the other side, of course.

41:09.316 --> 41:12.600
You could stack the bodies
like cordwood.

41:12.602 --> 41:14.935
Who was
number three?

41:15.738 --> 41:18.489
Renko.

41:18.491 --> 41:20.792
Number two was Dom.

41:20.794 --> 41:24.278
Sullivan was the first.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.998
Do you talk
to them, too?

41:27.800 --> 41:30.134
From time to time.

41:37.292 --> 41:39.627
You think I'm going mad?

41:39.629 --> 41:41.112
Oh, probably.

41:41.114 --> 41:42.797
Do you remember
when you picked me up

41:42.799 --> 41:45.166
from the orphanage?

41:45.168 --> 41:48.636
I didn't let go of your hand
for three days.

41:48.638 --> 41:49.637
I was seven and I...

41:49.639 --> 41:50.605
Stop it.

41:50.607 --> 41:55.076
Too soon for fond memories,
Henrietta?

41:55.078 --> 41:58.029
You always were
an impertinent little brat.

41:58.031 --> 42:00.948
That's why
you loved me.

42:02.167 --> 42:05.219
Too much.

42:17.383 --> 42:19.117
He's not talking.

42:20.619 --> 42:22.653
The son of a bitch
who did this.

42:22.655 --> 42:25.690
There's no explanation
for his behavior?

42:25.692 --> 42:28.025
No, doesn't make
any sense.

42:28.027 --> 42:31.195
He leads us there,
kills Hunter...

42:31.197 --> 42:33.013
and gives himself up.

42:33.015 --> 42:35.400
He hasn't uttered
a single word.

42:36.235 --> 42:38.436
I'm gonna hand him over
to Callen.

42:39.555 --> 42:41.522
What?

42:41.524 --> 42:43.491
You think that's a mistake?

42:43.493 --> 42:48.045
This whole thing's
a mistake, Owen.

42:54.386 --> 42:57.271
Who were you talking to
just now?

42:58.874 --> 43:01.058
The dead.

43:11.286 --> 43:14.322
Let's start with
your full name.

43:19.495 --> 43:21.746
Okay, how about
your first name?

43:27.586 --> 43:30.955
Let me guess, you
want a lawyer?

43:34.843 --> 43:37.595
Sounds like he doesn't
want a lawyer, Sam.

43:37.597 --> 43:40.097
That's fine by me.

43:40.099 --> 43:42.917
What do you want?

43:43.719 --> 43:45.937
The right to
remain silent?

43:45.939 --> 43:48.773
That's fine, we'll
give you that.

43:48.775 --> 43:50.358
It's not gonna
help you.

43:52.644 --> 43:54.862
Because we both know,

43:54.864 --> 43:57.949
sooner or later you
will talk to me.

43:57.951 --> 44:00.201
'Cause that's what this
is all about, isn't it?

44:00.203 --> 44:03.237
You and me.

44:03.239 --> 44:04.772
(door opens)

44:04.774 --> 44:07.458
Do you have a minute?

44:10.796 --> 44:13.798
What time is it?

44:15.834 --> 44:18.219
The time.

44:22.758 --> 44:24.642
Ten after 6:00.

44:24.644 --> 44:28.646
In exactly six hours
from now,

44:28.648 --> 44:32.700
I'll be walking out of here,
Agent Callen.

44:36.137 --> 44:40.074
And you'll be holding
the door for me.

44:46.865 --> 44:49.050
(chuckles)

44:54.006 --> 44:56.290
GRANGER:
Agent Callen,

44:56.292 --> 45:00.928
six weeks ago an NSA analyst
named Kelvin Atley went missing.

45:00.930 --> 45:02.763
After he disappeared,
the NSA discovered

45:02.765 --> 45:05.099
Atley had used his clearance
to access

45:05.101 --> 45:08.052
a highly classified file,
code-named Cherokee.

45:08.054 --> 45:09.854
Nell.

45:09.856 --> 45:11.105
NELL:
Cherokee is the cover name

45:11.107 --> 45:12.506
of an asset
with access

45:12.508 --> 45:15.443
to the highest echelons
of Iran's military.

45:15.445 --> 45:17.612
In particular,
Cherokee has supplied

45:17.614 --> 45:20.231
critical intelligence
on Iran's nuclear program.

45:20.233 --> 45:22.199
Atley knows everything
about Cherokee,

45:22.201 --> 45:23.985
including
his real name.

45:23.987 --> 45:26.237
Agent Hunter
got an anonymous tip

45:26.239 --> 45:27.521
about Atley in Paris,

45:27.523 --> 45:29.790
tracked him to New York
two days ago and disappeared.

45:29.792 --> 45:31.859
You think the anonymous tip
came from the Chameleon?

45:31.861 --> 45:32.960
Looks that way.

45:32.962 --> 45:34.545
Then how do we know
he has Atley?

45:34.547 --> 45:37.031
We don't, but if he does,
we need to get him back

45:37.033 --> 45:39.383
before he compromises
our man in Tehran.

45:39.385 --> 45:41.168
How does Renko fit into this?

45:41.170 --> 45:43.504
As far as we can see,
he doesn't.

45:43.506 --> 45:45.256
I don't know
why he killed Renko.

45:45.258 --> 45:47.341
CALLEN: Maybe he
was just trying

45:47.343 --> 45:50.161
to get our attention.

45:54.316 --> 45:56.400
Why don't you tell us
about Kelvin Atley.

45:58.987 --> 46:01.889
I'd rather tell you
about the Mayfields.

46:01.891 --> 46:03.774
A family of gun runners?

46:03.776 --> 46:07.745
Unfinished business
from five years ago.

46:07.747 --> 46:11.415
A mistake to ever trust them.

46:11.417 --> 46:14.201
Thank you for taking care
of that for me.

46:14.203 --> 46:16.621
You set them up.

46:16.623 --> 46:21.408
Just enough for Agent Renko
to get interested.

46:21.410 --> 46:25.880
I thought they would find out
he was an NCIS agent,

46:25.882 --> 46:27.581
but they didn't.

46:27.583 --> 46:29.083
So you tipped them off.

46:29.085 --> 46:30.718
Then tipped us off

46:30.720 --> 46:33.404
that Renko's identity
had been compromised.

46:39.227 --> 46:41.479
Setting the board.

46:42.364 --> 46:44.532
So, why'd you shoot him?

46:46.234 --> 46:48.319
First move.

46:48.321 --> 46:52.606
You countered
by coming after me.

46:54.292 --> 46:56.160
Second move.

46:56.162 --> 46:58.629
I killed Agent Hunter.

47:02.134 --> 47:04.952
You countered
by bringing me here.

47:04.954 --> 47:06.921
This is a game to you?

47:06.923 --> 47:10.641
You play chess, Agent Callen?

47:11.510 --> 47:13.227
A little.

47:13.229 --> 47:17.214
The term, <i>sans voir.</i>

47:18.600 --> 47:20.568
Playing blindfolded.

47:26.641 --> 47:30.444
You are in a
secure facility.

47:30.446 --> 47:32.480
Who's the blind one?

47:33.782 --> 47:35.499
You are.

47:35.501 --> 47:37.651
Really?

47:37.653 --> 47:39.704
And whose move is it?

47:39.706 --> 47:40.905
Mine.

48:00.642 --> 48:03.060
A file-sharing Web site?

48:03.062 --> 48:06.513
The password is...

48:06.515 --> 48:09.600
"Muley Hassan."

48:17.525 --> 48:20.795
ERIC: <i>All right,</i>
<i>it's a public Web site.</i>

48:20.797 --> 48:21.962
You upload your file,

48:21.964 --> 48:24.364
and anyone with the password
can download it.

48:24.366 --> 48:26.533
Muley Hassan.

48:26.535 --> 48:28.502
Mean anything to anyone?

48:28.504 --> 48:32.223
Last emirate of Granada
in the 15th century.

48:32.225 --> 48:33.974
Didn't happen
to play chess, did he?

48:33.976 --> 48:35.509
Famously.

48:35.511 --> 48:37.377
He would use prisoners

48:37.379 --> 48:39.263
from the royal dungeons
as his pieces,

48:39.265 --> 48:41.515
and if one of the pieces
were captured,

48:41.517 --> 48:43.984
he'd have the prisoner
beheaded on the spot.

48:46.104 --> 48:47.354
Chess club.

48:48.190 --> 48:49.356
(beeping)

48:49.358 --> 48:50.658
All right, download's finished.

48:50.660 --> 48:52.877
It's a video file.

49:01.837 --> 49:03.704
Play it, Eric.

49:03.706 --> 49:06.373
I made a mess of this one.

49:06.375 --> 49:09.293
I'm sorry that I let you down.

49:09.295 --> 49:11.712
CHAMELEON:
Go ahead, tell them.

49:13.048 --> 49:16.467
He-he wants me to tell you
that his name is Marcel Janvier.

49:16.469 --> 49:19.253
He is a French national,
born in Lyon.

49:19.255 --> 49:22.306
He is holding Kelvin Atley.

49:22.308 --> 49:24.225
If you don't give him
what he wants,

49:24.227 --> 49:25.392
he'll put Atley on the market,

49:25.394 --> 49:27.311
and he'll sell him
to the highest bidder.

49:28.263 --> 49:30.114
CHAMELEON:
Tell them what I need.

49:30.116 --> 49:31.999
He wants $50 million

49:32.001 --> 49:34.702
deposited in his bank account
by noon today.

49:34.704 --> 49:37.771
He'll give you
the account details.

49:37.773 --> 49:39.957
(speaking foreign language)

49:44.579 --> 49:46.997
GRANGER:
Get that tape analyzed, Eric.

49:46.999 --> 49:49.216
Does anyone recognize
the language?

49:49.218 --> 49:51.218
Romani.
It... it was a number.

49:51.220 --> 49:52.503
Like a phone number.

49:52.505 --> 49:54.221
KENSI:
How exactly does he think

49:54.223 --> 49:56.724
that he can kill someone
in front of us,

49:56.726 --> 49:59.226
and then expect us
to let him go?

49:59.228 --> 50:02.563
Because Janvier--
if that is his name--

50:02.565 --> 50:05.299
thinks we'll have
no other choice.

50:05.301 --> 50:07.434
Janvier for Atley.

50:07.436 --> 50:10.354
He wants to do
a prisoner exchange.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.550
The number
is a cell phone.

50:22.552 --> 50:23.768
GPS?
Turned off.

50:23.770 --> 50:24.853
Burn phone--

50:24.855 --> 50:26.120
number was activated
three days ago.

50:26.122 --> 50:27.755
All right, find out
where it was bought.

50:27.757 --> 50:29.174
Maybe we'll be lucky
with the store's

50:29.176 --> 50:31.476
security footage
or a credit card receipt.

50:31.478 --> 50:32.510
Hetty.

50:32.512 --> 50:34.379
We are not letting this guy go.

50:34.381 --> 50:36.648
No.

50:36.650 --> 50:38.233
Indeed, we're not.

50:38.235 --> 50:39.884
That's not a decision
we get to make,

50:39.886 --> 50:42.487
Agent Callen.

50:46.325 --> 50:49.894
Sometimes I really
hate that guy.

50:49.896 --> 50:52.063
Only sometimes?

50:56.568 --> 50:59.087
How'd you get to Atley?

51:01.423 --> 51:04.676
Same way I got to Hunter.

51:04.678 --> 51:07.095
Same way I got to Renko.

51:09.181 --> 51:12.416
Same way I got to you,
Agent Callen.

51:12.418 --> 51:15.753
Everyone has a weakness.

51:15.755 --> 51:18.356
So what was Atley's?

51:18.358 --> 51:21.392
Right now,
you've convinced yourself

51:21.394 --> 51:24.729
that you will not
hand me over for him.

51:24.731 --> 51:26.097
Predictable response

51:26.099 --> 51:30.568
based on your
emotional attachment

51:30.570 --> 51:32.603
to your dead friends.

51:32.605 --> 51:34.539
Those who will ultimately

51:34.541 --> 51:39.827
make the decision
won't share that attachment.

51:39.829 --> 51:42.947
Who do you think's gonna
want Atley the most, Sam?

51:42.949 --> 51:44.799
Hmm.

51:44.801 --> 51:45.884
Chinese?

51:45.886 --> 51:48.670
Chinese would
pay for him.

51:48.672 --> 51:51.956
Mid-level analyst, top
security clearance.

51:51.958 --> 51:54.292
They'd have to believe he's
gonna know something they don't.

51:54.294 --> 51:55.727
Yeah? How about the Israelis?

51:55.729 --> 51:58.479
Now, the Israelis would
definitely be interested.

51:58.481 --> 52:00.014
Guy like Atley
could spill

52:00.016 --> 52:03.768
all kinds of classified intel
about Iran that we don't share.

52:03.770 --> 52:06.971
Bet you Tel Aviv is on their way
to the ATM right now.

52:06.973 --> 52:08.306
So you like the Israelis?

52:08.308 --> 52:10.108
They're definitely in the hunt.

52:10.110 --> 52:12.076
But I think there's someone
who wants Atley

52:12.078 --> 52:13.745
even more than the Israelis.

52:15.814 --> 52:17.448
Iran.

52:17.450 --> 52:20.702
They got a traitor
in the house.

52:20.704 --> 52:23.538
Atley knows
who it is.

52:23.540 --> 52:25.590
Tehran.

52:25.592 --> 52:27.875
That's top dollar right there.

52:27.877 --> 52:31.679
So we don't buy him, Iran does.

52:34.166 --> 52:36.500
You abduct him?

52:36.502 --> 52:38.019
Blackmail.

52:38.021 --> 52:40.054
A woman?

52:40.056 --> 52:41.672
A girl.

52:41.674 --> 52:44.008
Underage.

52:44.010 --> 52:46.978
He was very willing
to believe me

52:46.980 --> 52:49.614
when I said
we would be partners.

52:52.117 --> 52:54.619
That's a nice try.

52:54.621 --> 52:56.621
But Atley's gay.

52:56.623 --> 52:59.040
He thought he kept it
a secret from the NSA,

52:59.042 --> 53:01.376
but it's noted
in his personnel file.

53:01.378 --> 53:06.364
Welcome to the game,
Agent Callen.

53:10.919 --> 53:13.304
If you'd shared
operational details,

53:13.306 --> 53:15.340
this would never
have happened.

53:15.342 --> 53:17.675
Your assumption, Henrietta,
that your involvement would have

53:17.677 --> 53:20.144
resulted in a different outcome
is egotistical,

53:20.146 --> 53:22.430
and it exposes
your greatest weakness.

53:22.432 --> 53:25.216
I should have been informed.

53:25.218 --> 53:27.852
You didn't need to know.

53:27.854 --> 53:29.404
(computer beeping)
ERIC: Uh, guys?

53:30.739 --> 53:32.357
Um, I mean...

53:32.359 --> 53:33.891
Cell phone's been turned on.

53:33.893 --> 53:35.326
And we have a GPS fix.

53:36.245 --> 53:37.912
What do you got, Eric?

53:37.914 --> 53:39.247
Cell phone's been turned on.

53:39.249 --> 53:41.699
GPS puts it at an abandoned
freight warehouse downtown.

53:41.701 --> 53:43.785
Address is
uploading now.

53:43.787 --> 53:46.287
Why wouldn't Janvier
edit out what she said?

53:46.289 --> 53:49.573
Either he doesn't care or
he wanted us to chase it down.

53:49.575 --> 53:50.741
Like we have
a choice.

53:50.743 --> 53:52.176
Don't lose that signal, Eric.

53:52.178 --> 53:53.378
GRANGER:
Not you, Agent Callen.

53:53.380 --> 53:56.197
Want you to keep
the pressure on Janvier.

53:57.516 --> 54:00.034
Don't test me, Agent Callen.

54:23.075 --> 54:24.409
(monitor beeps)

55:00.913 --> 55:02.997
DEEKS:
There's no people.

55:02.999 --> 55:04.916
This place is like a ghost town.

55:04.918 --> 55:08.002
I don't think
I like this at all.

55:08.004 --> 55:10.204
(sighs) Me neither.

55:20.165 --> 55:23.667
You let me go once.

55:23.669 --> 55:26.003
I didn't know who you were.

55:26.005 --> 55:29.307
But now you do.

55:29.309 --> 55:32.193
And you will still
have to let me go.

55:34.062 --> 55:36.314
That's not gonna happen.

55:37.983 --> 55:40.151
Picture's up.

55:42.454 --> 55:44.205
I'll take the back.

55:44.207 --> 55:46.824
Copy.

55:46.826 --> 55:48.159
How's your mouth?

55:48.161 --> 55:51.862
Mm, I still get headaches.

55:52.998 --> 55:54.382
Good.

55:54.384 --> 55:58.202
I find the sea air helps.

56:00.973 --> 56:03.474
You slipped up the
day I shot you.

56:03.476 --> 56:06.377
It won't happen again.

56:06.379 --> 56:08.229
You sure about that?

56:08.231 --> 56:11.215
Are you?

56:16.905 --> 56:19.056
Kens.

56:27.332 --> 56:30.668
(cell phone ringing)

56:30.670 --> 56:35.673
Sometimes you have to sacrifice
a piece to win an adage.

56:35.675 --> 56:39.961
You need to know your
opponent's next move

56:39.963 --> 56:42.847
before he does.

56:45.601 --> 56:47.051
Eric!

56:47.053 --> 56:48.786
Get them out of there!
It's a trap!

56:48.788 --> 56:50.087
Guys!

56:50.089 --> 56:51.922
Guys, get out of
the building now!

56:51.924 --> 56:53.024
(cell phone continues ringing)

56:53.026 --> 56:54.592
Go! Go!

57:19.918 --> 57:21.619
(grunting weakly)

57:27.809 --> 57:29.427
You okay?

57:29.429 --> 57:31.145
Yeah. You?

57:31.147 --> 57:33.314
(groaning)

57:36.602 --> 57:37.568
Sam.

57:37.570 --> 57:39.654
Sam!

57:42.307 --> 57:44.492
Sam!

57:48.096 --> 57:50.481
Sam!

57:51.917 --> 57:54.368
(coughing)

57:54.370 --> 57:56.320
(sighs)

57:57.673 --> 57:59.340
(coughing)

58:07.266 --> 58:09.467
(sirens approaching)

58:23.323 --> 58:24.973
(door opens)

58:24.975 --> 58:28.310
You want to kill someone,
try me!

58:28.312 --> 58:30.732
In fact, here.
Use this.

58:30.832 --> 58:33.416
All you got to do
is squeeze the trigger.

58:33.418 --> 58:34.751
Take it.

58:37.955 --> 58:38.788
Take it!

58:38.790 --> 58:40.306
And give you an excuse

58:40.308 --> 58:42.308
to break my neck?

58:44.178 --> 58:46.229
I don't need another excuse.

58:46.231 --> 58:50.934
You value the lives
of Agent Hunter and Agent Renko

58:50.936 --> 58:53.153
less than the others.

58:59.110 --> 59:01.828
You kill me...

59:01.830 --> 59:03.913
and I win.

59:07.418 --> 59:09.252
Stand down, Mr. Callen.

59:11.589 --> 59:14.841
I said stand down.

59:32.726 --> 59:34.360
Was, um...

59:34.362 --> 59:37.480
anyone killed?

59:37.482 --> 59:39.732
No.

59:39.734 --> 59:41.851
Pity.

59:54.215 --> 59:55.582
Put that thing away before

59:55.584 --> 59:58.818
I take it off you
and shoot the bastard myself.

01:00:02.256 --> 01:00:03.840
He was speaking Romani,
wasn't he?

01:00:03.842 --> 01:00:05.558
Oh, he knew
what Hunter said

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.177
the minute she said it.

01:00:07.179 --> 01:00:09.179
So he planted the number,
made her think it was important,

01:00:09.181 --> 01:00:10.647
then he used her to set us up.

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:11.815
Yeah.

01:00:17.855 --> 01:00:20.406
The last time I lost an agent,

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:23.559
I handed my resignation
to Director Vance.

01:00:23.561 --> 01:00:25.328
And I lifted it
out of his pocket

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:26.913
and I gave it back to you.

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:28.397
It's still in my desk.

01:00:28.399 --> 01:00:33.419
Only, now I've lost
two more agents.

01:00:33.421 --> 01:00:34.904
She was special?

01:00:34.906 --> 01:00:39.175
You know I don't have favorites,
Mr. Callen.

01:00:40.961 --> 01:00:43.880
You telling me that
after all these years...

01:00:49.186 --> 01:00:50.887
(sighs)

01:00:52.723 --> 01:00:54.390
Could you see her,

01:00:54.392 --> 01:00:58.411
her face, at the end?

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.764
(gasps)

01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:08.104
(sighs)

01:01:08.106 --> 01:01:10.456
Did she know?

01:01:15.579 --> 01:01:17.747
Was she afraid?

01:01:23.387 --> 01:01:26.289
Angry and defiant.

01:01:29.426 --> 01:01:32.929
And yeah...

01:01:32.931 --> 01:01:34.597
she was afraid.

01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:45.925
How long did you know her?

01:01:48.478 --> 01:01:50.980
Almost 30 years.

01:01:50.982 --> 01:01:53.499
Not as long as I've known you.

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.001
But like you,

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:58.204
I found her
in an orphanage.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:03.509
Any other orphanage kids out
there you want to tell me about?

01:02:09.133 --> 01:02:12.018
She said something else
at the end, didn't she?

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.787
On the tape,
when she gave the number.

01:02:18.559 --> 01:02:21.361
"I'm sorry."

01:02:23.113 --> 01:02:25.732
She said, "I'm sorry."

01:02:29.403 --> 01:02:32.622
She was saying it to me.

01:02:38.462 --> 01:02:40.964
We're not letting this guy
out of here.

01:02:43.083 --> 01:02:44.700
We're not letting
them exchange

01:02:44.702 --> 01:02:47.370
this guy for Atley.

01:02:48.672 --> 01:02:53.259
And if we don't
and Atley shares his secrets,

01:02:53.261 --> 01:02:57.513
a very brave man in Tehran
will almost certainly die.

01:02:57.515 --> 01:03:01.717
Do you really think
we have a choice, Mr. Callen?

01:03:02.736 --> 01:03:04.737
You should have let me
shoot him.

01:03:14.031 --> 01:03:15.498
Okay.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.750
Traffic cams.

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:19.786
One?

01:03:19.788 --> 01:03:21.704
One traffic cam. Really?

01:03:21.706 --> 01:03:25.792
Okay, so it's a red-light camera
a block from the warehouse.

01:03:25.794 --> 01:03:27.076
Let's try pulling up the footage

01:03:27.078 --> 01:03:28.695
immediately after the bomb
was detonated.

01:03:30.431 --> 01:03:32.098
Oh, wait.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.416
Go back.

01:03:33.418 --> 01:03:34.384
(horn honking)

01:03:34.386 --> 01:03:36.419
Whoa. That guy's
in a hurry.

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:38.137
Maybe we just got lucky.

01:03:38.139 --> 01:03:39.922
Plug the details
into Kaleidoscope.

01:03:39.924 --> 01:03:41.774
Let's see where this guy went.
Yeah.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:43.142
Hey, Sam?

01:03:43.144 --> 01:03:44.394
SAM:
Yeah.

01:03:44.396 --> 01:03:46.029
Sam, I got something for you.
What is it, Eric?

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:47.930
Yeah, we had a car
run a red light

01:03:47.932 --> 01:03:50.216
at the end of the block
less than half a minute

01:03:50.218 --> 01:03:51.651
after the bomb was detonated.

01:03:51.653 --> 01:03:53.019
Black M-Series Mercedes.

01:03:53.021 --> 01:03:56.289
License plate
is two-Sierra-Alpha...

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.790
Quebec-three-two-one?

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:59.608
Uh, how did you know that?

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:02.378
'Cause I'm staring right at it.

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.298
Eric, you might want
to run that plate.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.649
I'm on it.

01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:08.784
12:00.

01:04:08.786 --> 01:04:10.970
Near the kid
with the skateboard.

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:14.507
Maybe.

01:04:14.509 --> 01:04:15.692
Could be.

01:04:18.762 --> 01:04:20.913
That's them.
Go.

01:04:24.768 --> 01:04:26.302
(tires squealing)

01:04:44.338 --> 01:04:47.757
(horns honking)

01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:17.703
(tires screeching)

01:05:41.678 --> 01:05:44.713
That's a giant train
about six inches to your left.

01:05:44.715 --> 01:05:45.881
Deeks, shut up.

01:05:54.775 --> 01:05:57.593
SAM: <i>Can't make it!</i>
<i>You can't make it!</i>

01:06:06.203 --> 01:06:08.371
Federal agents!

01:06:08.373 --> 01:06:09.455
Get out of the car!

01:06:09.457 --> 01:06:11.174
Put your hands where
we can see them!

01:06:15.429 --> 01:06:17.096
DEEKS:
Get against the train.

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:19.015
Put your hands
against the train!

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.516
Move!

01:06:21.902 --> 01:06:25.021
Okay, the car
is registered to...

01:06:29.776 --> 01:06:31.110
Not good.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:33.312
(cell phone ringing)

01:06:34.398 --> 01:06:36.566
Yeah, Eric.

01:06:38.101 --> 01:06:40.536
KENSI:
Look forward.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.955
What?

01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:48.044
No mistake?

01:06:48.046 --> 01:06:49.712
No mistake.

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:53.699
Car is registered
to the Israeli Consulate.

01:06:53.701 --> 01:06:56.052
Sam, you're going to have
to let them go.

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:09.464
They were at the warehouse.

01:07:09.465 --> 01:07:10.732
They tried to get away.

01:07:10.734 --> 01:07:12.684
If they weren't involved,
then at the very least,

01:07:12.686 --> 01:07:13.985
they may have seen something.

01:07:13.987 --> 01:07:15.320
GRANGER:
I understand, Agent Hanna,

01:07:15.322 --> 01:07:17.105
but I'm telling you,
cut them loose.

01:07:17.107 --> 01:07:18.690
State Department
has confirmed their identities.

01:07:18.692 --> 01:07:21.409
They're both employed
by the Israeli Consulate.

01:07:21.411 --> 01:07:22.360
Mossad?

01:07:22.362 --> 01:07:23.644
Probably.

01:07:23.646 --> 01:07:25.446
We've got to let them go.

01:07:26.582 --> 01:07:28.533
Let them go.

01:07:28.535 --> 01:07:30.985
That's an order, Agent Hanna.

01:07:31.987 --> 01:07:34.172
Yes, sir.

01:07:36.875 --> 01:07:38.326
You're going to be charged

01:07:38.328 --> 01:07:40.494
with the attempted murder
of a federal agent.

01:07:40.496 --> 01:07:42.130
You need to speak
to your State Department.

01:07:42.132 --> 01:07:43.264
We did.

01:07:43.266 --> 01:07:44.498
This is an outrage.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.499
Two federal agents are dead,

01:07:45.501 --> 01:07:47.051
and our allies
are refusing to tell us

01:07:47.053 --> 01:07:48.219
what the hell is going on.

01:07:48.221 --> 01:07:49.387
Don't talk to me about outrage.

01:07:49.389 --> 01:07:51.055
It will never reach court.

01:07:51.057 --> 01:07:52.640
Probably not.

01:07:52.642 --> 01:07:54.776
But we could drag
this thing out

01:07:54.778 --> 01:07:55.977
three, maybe four months.

01:07:55.979 --> 01:07:57.645
Find you a nice,
quiet corner in hell,

01:07:57.647 --> 01:07:59.314
have you begging
to be sent to Gitmo.

01:07:59.316 --> 01:08:00.481
I assure you, we had no idea

01:08:00.483 --> 01:08:01.866
this was going to happen.
If we knew,

01:08:01.868 --> 01:08:03.067
we would have
warned you.

01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:04.402
What were you
doing there?

01:08:04.404 --> 01:08:06.321
The same thing you were doing.

01:08:06.323 --> 01:08:07.739
Looking for someone.

01:08:07.741 --> 01:08:09.324
Who?

01:08:11.526 --> 01:08:12.577
(train whistle blowing)

01:08:12.579 --> 01:08:13.911
Cuff them.

01:08:13.913 --> 01:08:15.163
Done.

01:08:16.715 --> 01:08:19.966
I am going to make this
as uncomfortable as possible.

01:08:19.969 --> 01:08:21.419
He's a French national.

01:08:21.421 --> 01:08:23.421
We lost track of him
yesterday morning.

01:08:23.423 --> 01:08:26.224
The last place we saw
him was the warehouse.

01:08:26.225 --> 01:08:28.843
So you came back
and staked it out.

01:08:28.845 --> 01:08:31.212
We had no idea they'd
wired the building.

01:08:31.214 --> 01:08:32.764
We got out fast
and circled back

01:08:32.765 --> 01:08:34.232
to find out
what we could.

01:08:34.234 --> 01:08:36.684
And then you saw us.

01:08:38.103 --> 01:08:39.553
Easy.

01:08:39.555 --> 01:08:40.938
If you have more questions,

01:08:40.939 --> 01:08:42.890
please submit them
in writing to our embassy.

01:08:42.892 --> 01:08:44.776
KENSI:
Have a nice day.

01:08:45.894 --> 01:08:48.229
Tell me you got it, Deeks.
Oh, yeah, I got it.

01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:49.947
They're going to be so pissed

01:08:49.948 --> 01:08:51.282
when they check
that camera.

01:08:51.283 --> 01:08:53.033
Good.

01:08:55.537 --> 01:08:58.072
GRANGER: Do I want to know
where you got these from?

01:08:58.073 --> 01:09:00.140
Probably not.

01:09:01.877 --> 01:09:04.462
I count six guys.

01:09:04.464 --> 01:09:06.346
CALLEN:
Janvier got himself a new crew.

01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:08.582
Find them, we find Atley.

01:09:09.768 --> 01:09:11.301
Who's our mystery man?

01:09:11.304 --> 01:09:13.104
NELL:
We don't have a clear shot.

01:09:13.106 --> 01:09:14.471
He's either obscured

01:09:14.474 --> 01:09:16.390
or looking the wrong way
at the right time.

01:09:16.393 --> 01:09:18.091
Photos are time
and date stamped,

01:09:18.094 --> 01:09:20.044
and Santa Monica Pier
is a tourist hot spot.

01:09:20.046 --> 01:09:22.279
A lot of people with
a lot of cameras.

01:09:22.282 --> 01:09:24.198
We'll trawl the
social media sites,

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.933
see if we can pull
together a panorama.

01:09:25.935 --> 01:09:27.335
Janvier's got
good protection.

01:09:27.337 --> 01:09:28.636
They're obviously pros.

01:09:28.638 --> 01:09:30.270
What about their cars?

01:09:30.273 --> 01:09:31.639
Just a few
partial license plates.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.907
I could start
a Kaleidoscope search.

01:09:32.908 --> 01:09:34.207
KENSI: Narrow down the
search parameters.

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:36.243
Instead of looking
for individual cars,

01:09:36.246 --> 01:09:38.162
look for all of them
in the same place.

01:09:38.163 --> 01:09:40.747
Say, parked outside a house
or in a parking lot.

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:43.468
It would be best if we
could narrow the search area.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.537
Nell, start your search
on the coast-- Malibu.

01:09:46.538 --> 01:09:48.256
Work your way south.

01:09:48.258 --> 01:09:50.006
Janvier likes the sea air.

01:09:50.009 --> 01:09:52.126
Will do.

01:10:17.619 --> 01:10:21.055
Agent G. Callen.

01:10:22.057 --> 01:10:25.726
You want to know
what the "G" stands for?

01:10:27.196 --> 01:10:31.015
Of course you
do-- Gary.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.268
Gaston.

01:10:35.354 --> 01:10:37.338
Gustav.

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.307
(chuckles)

01:10:39.309 --> 01:10:43.177
I've had so many names,
and you just want one.

01:10:44.196 --> 01:10:46.614
Marcel Janvier.

01:10:46.616 --> 01:10:48.266
One of many?

01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:53.955
Why me?

01:10:53.957 --> 01:10:55.706
You shot me.

01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:58.242
But you came back.
Curiosity.

01:10:58.244 --> 01:10:59.577
I almost caught you.

01:10:59.579 --> 01:11:00.912
But you didn't.

01:11:00.914 --> 01:11:02.964
And don't make the mistake

01:11:02.966 --> 01:11:06.250
of thinking
that I'm caught this time.

01:11:11.089 --> 01:11:13.140
Whose move?

01:11:13.976 --> 01:11:15.643
Mine.

01:11:15.645 --> 01:11:18.646
Choose carefully.

01:11:18.648 --> 01:11:21.682
You don't have many left.

01:11:24.386 --> 01:11:25.719
Come on.

01:11:25.721 --> 01:11:26.854
(beeping)

01:11:26.856 --> 01:11:28.055
Guys, I got a hit.

01:11:29.274 --> 01:11:30.942
All three cars,
same location.

01:11:30.944 --> 01:11:32.226
It looks like a condo

01:11:32.228 --> 01:11:33.861
in Marina Del Rey.

01:11:33.863 --> 01:11:35.112
Okay, we're taking
a tactical team.

01:11:35.114 --> 01:11:36.998
Call Callen. Let's move.

01:11:51.246 --> 01:11:53.097
SAM: Their cars
are still here.

01:11:53.099 --> 01:11:54.632
We know if they are?

01:11:55.684 --> 01:11:57.635
Condo manager identified
Kelvin Atley from a photo.

01:11:57.637 --> 01:11:59.604
18th floor penthouse,
short-term rental.

01:11:59.606 --> 01:12:01.055
Atley plus seven others.

01:12:01.057 --> 01:12:03.858
We get Atley, it's game over.

01:12:04.693 --> 01:12:06.944
We play our game, G, not his.

01:12:06.946 --> 01:12:09.096
Either way, he loses.

01:12:09.098 --> 01:12:10.431
Deeks.
Yeah.

01:12:10.433 --> 01:12:11.916
Keys to the front door.

01:12:12.951 --> 01:12:14.902
Done.

01:12:48.487 --> 01:12:50.137
We're clear.

01:12:50.139 --> 01:12:51.238
No wires.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.107
It ain't going
to go bang.

01:12:53.109 --> 01:12:54.992
(pumps shotgun)

01:13:14.346 --> 01:13:15.630
Clear.

01:13:15.632 --> 01:13:17.298
Clear.

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.350
Clear.
Clear.

01:13:19.352 --> 01:13:21.552
Looks like somebody
beat us to it.

01:13:21.554 --> 01:13:22.503
Atley?

01:13:22.505 --> 01:13:23.721
KENSI: Negative.
DEEKS: No.

01:13:23.723 --> 01:13:25.773
He's not here; he's gone.

01:13:27.609 --> 01:13:29.143
Guys?

01:13:29.145 --> 01:13:30.344
In here.

01:13:52.935 --> 01:13:55.653
So we've got almost 100 photos
from social media sites

01:13:55.655 --> 01:13:59.307
taken at Santa Monica Pier
that fit our time window.

01:13:59.309 --> 01:14:03.328
Whole range of different
cameras, different qualities.

01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:06.581
Not to mention
different subjects.

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:08.616
That a fish-eye lens?

01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:11.920
For his sake, I hope so.

01:14:11.922 --> 01:14:15.290
Okay, downloading the photos
into the application.

01:14:15.292 --> 01:14:18.460
Let the magic begin.

01:14:22.831 --> 01:14:24.682
Well, lots
of tourists.

01:14:24.684 --> 01:14:28.336
And every one of them
a budding photographer.

01:14:28.338 --> 01:14:29.854
There's Janvier.

01:14:29.856 --> 01:14:32.106
And there is
our mystery man.

01:14:32.108 --> 01:14:35.460
Let's come in from
the other side.

01:14:35.462 --> 01:14:37.979
Love this technology.

01:14:39.681 --> 01:14:41.566
Mystery man has a face.
Uh-huh.

01:14:41.568 --> 01:14:44.202
Can you zoom in?

01:14:44.204 --> 01:14:46.187
Snip him and we'll run him
through photo-rec,

01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:48.373
give our mystery
face a name.

01:14:48.375 --> 01:14:50.842
If this guy's in the
database, we'll find him.

01:14:52.661 --> 01:14:55.246
Consider him snipped.

01:14:55.248 --> 01:14:57.415
Oh, damn.

01:14:57.417 --> 01:14:58.633
What?

01:14:58.635 --> 01:15:00.668
Now I feel like
a chili dog.

01:15:01.921 --> 01:15:04.005
Yes, sir, I understand.

01:15:05.391 --> 01:15:08.226
No, I have no idea
how that could happen.

01:15:10.563 --> 01:15:13.731
I will make it a priority, sir.

01:15:18.487 --> 01:15:20.488
The Israelis
are pissed.

01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:22.323
The undersecretary at
the State Department

01:15:22.325 --> 01:15:24.943
wants a full
investigation.

01:15:24.945 --> 01:15:28.196
He also asked me about
a missing SD card from a camera.

01:15:28.198 --> 01:15:30.665
I told him we didn't know
anything about that.

01:15:31.951 --> 01:15:35.587
Have you ever come up against
someone like this before?

01:15:35.589 --> 01:15:38.540
No.

01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:40.291
He's evil.

01:15:40.293 --> 01:15:42.243
He's many things.

01:15:42.245 --> 01:15:47.365
But there's only one thing
he's not and should be.

01:15:48.601 --> 01:15:50.751
Dead.

01:15:50.753 --> 01:15:52.287
(door opens)

01:15:59.612 --> 01:16:01.396
So, we're all
out of time.

01:16:01.398 --> 01:16:03.865
They've authorized
the exchange.

01:16:03.867 --> 01:16:07.118
We give Janvier what he wants,
we let him go, we get Atley,

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.788
and the identity of our
asset in Iran is safe.

01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:12.073
You're gonna let this happen?

01:16:12.075 --> 01:16:14.559
We are all gonna let this
happen, Agent Callen.

01:16:14.561 --> 01:16:18.746
So Hunter and Renko
died for nothing?

01:16:18.748 --> 01:16:21.466
They died to protect an asset
that could be the only thing

01:16:21.468 --> 01:16:23.668
standing between us and
another war in the Middle East.

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:25.637
There will always be another war
in the Middle East!

01:16:25.639 --> 01:16:26.638
Sorry to interrupt.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.006
What is it, Eric?

01:16:28.008 --> 01:16:30.808
We've identified the man Janvier
met at Santa Monica Pier.

01:16:30.810 --> 01:16:33.094
His name is Naseem Vaziri.

01:16:33.096 --> 01:16:34.312
He's Iranian.

01:16:34.314 --> 01:16:36.931
NELL: He runs an international
air freight business,

01:16:36.933 --> 01:16:38.232
and the NSA believes

01:16:38.234 --> 01:16:40.818
he has close ties
to Iranian intelligence.

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.187
What if Atley
already told Janvier

01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:45.239
the name of the asset in Iran?

01:16:46.442 --> 01:16:49.861
Janvier then sells the name
to this Iranian, Vaziri,

01:16:49.863 --> 01:16:51.946
before he sells
Atley back to us.

01:16:51.948 --> 01:16:54.616
Janvier gets paid
from both sides,

01:16:54.618 --> 01:16:56.334
Cherokee gets compromised.

01:16:56.336 --> 01:16:58.086
Cherokee could've already
been picked up in Tehran!

01:16:58.088 --> 01:16:59.370
They could be torturing
him right now!

01:16:59.372 --> 01:17:01.589
Eric, find out
if there have been

01:17:01.591 --> 01:17:04.492
any fund transfers
into Janvier's account

01:17:04.494 --> 01:17:06.127
in the past 48 hours.

01:17:06.129 --> 01:17:08.129
It's too late;
we have to proceed.

01:17:08.131 --> 01:17:11.015
We need to get Atley back,
and that's the price we pay.

01:17:11.017 --> 01:17:12.350
The price we pay?!

01:17:12.352 --> 01:17:13.801
You need to let this go.

01:17:13.803 --> 01:17:15.053
He killed our people!

01:17:15.055 --> 01:17:16.354
Our people!

01:17:16.356 --> 01:17:18.306
We are out of time,
Agent Callen!

01:17:18.308 --> 01:17:21.476
And we don't have another plan!

01:17:25.864 --> 01:17:28.533
HETTY:
I'm sorry, Mr. Callen.

01:17:30.369 --> 01:17:32.704
I'm sorry.

01:17:53.392 --> 01:17:55.476
Copy of the
transfer documents.

01:17:55.478 --> 01:17:58.012
$50 million

01:17:58.014 --> 01:18:02.233
wired to the account number you
gave us in the Cayman Islands.

01:18:04.019 --> 01:18:05.236
And binding agreement
promising you

01:18:05.238 --> 01:18:06.821
immunity from
prosecution

01:18:06.823 --> 01:18:09.741
signed by the Attorney
General of the United States.

01:18:09.743 --> 01:18:11.859
Phone.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:22.170
And a glass of water, please.

01:18:23.038 --> 01:18:25.790
(dialing)

01:18:25.792 --> 01:18:27.842
Get some water?

01:18:27.844 --> 01:18:29.994
(speaking French)

01:18:45.027 --> 01:18:46.894
Very good.

01:18:46.896 --> 01:18:49.096
Tell them to bring Atley.

01:19:07.966 --> 01:19:11.619
My move.

01:19:15.224 --> 01:19:17.141
JANVIER:
Straight ahead until

01:19:17.143 --> 01:19:19.894
I give you further directions.

01:19:19.896 --> 01:19:21.679
Any clue as to
where they're going?

01:19:21.681 --> 01:19:23.815
They're heading
towards downtown.

01:19:25.234 --> 01:19:27.968
Turn right.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:30.154
(tires screeching)

01:19:31.573 --> 01:19:34.826
Any further fund transfers
into his account?

01:19:34.828 --> 01:19:36.444
Still working it.

01:19:36.446 --> 01:19:37.829
Take the next left.

01:19:43.118 --> 01:19:45.620
<i>Stop.</i>

01:19:45.622 --> 01:19:47.171
<i>This is it.</i>

01:19:56.765 --> 01:19:59.350
The news team
is a strategic move

01:19:59.352 --> 01:20:02.670
to keep you honest,
Agent Callen.

01:20:02.672 --> 01:20:05.606
Where is he?

01:20:05.608 --> 01:20:09.193
The SUV across
the park.

01:20:11.146 --> 01:20:12.346
You can send

01:20:12.348 --> 01:20:13.798
your people to get him.

01:20:29.698 --> 01:20:31.966
You okay?

01:20:34.553 --> 01:20:36.337
NELL:
I'm looking for eyes.

01:20:36.339 --> 01:20:38.372
I got a traffic cam.

01:20:39.708 --> 01:20:41.642
This is messed up.

01:20:41.644 --> 01:20:42.810
Yep.

01:20:42.812 --> 01:20:44.812
Nothing we can change
about it now.

01:20:46.715 --> 01:20:49.567
That's Atley.

01:20:49.569 --> 01:20:51.102
He's drugged.

01:20:52.905 --> 01:20:54.105
ERIC:
We're in.

01:20:54.107 --> 01:20:55.890
Janvier's bank account.

01:20:55.892 --> 01:20:57.391
Transfer early yesterday.

01:20:57.393 --> 01:21:00.494
$50 million channeled through
a bank in Moscow.

01:21:00.496 --> 01:21:02.496
Where did
the transfer originate?

01:21:04.783 --> 01:21:06.033
Tehran.

01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:07.869
(sighs)

01:21:07.871 --> 01:21:10.404
So, Mr. Callen was right.

01:21:10.406 --> 01:21:12.857
No turning back now.

01:21:33.896 --> 01:21:37.114
(garbled radio transmissions)

01:21:46.625 --> 01:21:48.576
No.

01:21:48.578 --> 01:21:50.277
No, this is
not happening.

01:21:50.279 --> 01:21:51.278
Sam!

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.463
G, no!

01:21:53.999 --> 01:21:56.334
You're not
going anywhere.

01:21:56.336 --> 01:22:00.554
Are you gonna shoot me
for the whole world to see?

01:22:05.177 --> 01:22:06.427
Pull up that video feed.

01:22:10.565 --> 01:22:15.269
One can never be
too careful, Agent Callen.

01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:16.804
G, don't do this.
Let him go.

01:22:16.806 --> 01:22:19.907
(tires screech, siren whoops)

01:22:20.826 --> 01:22:21.993
Federal agents!

01:22:21.995 --> 01:22:23.828
We've got this covered!
Back down!

01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:24.862
Put the gun down!

01:22:24.864 --> 01:22:26.247
Lower your weapon!

01:22:26.249 --> 01:22:27.665
NCIS! Federal agents!

01:22:27.667 --> 01:22:29.116
(distorted, fading):
Stand down!

01:22:29.118 --> 01:22:30.201
He's a federal agent!

01:22:30.203 --> 01:22:32.653
(voices overlapping)

01:22:33.822 --> 01:22:36.123
OFFICER (distorted):
Put the weapon down!

01:22:36.125 --> 01:22:37.341
SAM:
Step back!

01:22:37.343 --> 01:22:38.659
(explosion)

01:22:38.661 --> 01:22:40.628
(voices distorted, overlapping)

01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:43.497
(panting)

01:22:46.334 --> 01:22:48.285
(echoing): Your move.

01:23:06.187 --> 01:23:07.488
KENSI:
Don't shoot!

01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:09.140
Don't shoot!
He's with us!

01:23:09.142 --> 01:23:10.691
Drop your weapon, G.
Drop your weapon.

01:23:10.693 --> 01:23:11.842
Easy!

01:23:11.844 --> 01:23:13.494
Move!
Against the van!

01:23:13.496 --> 01:23:14.528
Back off.
Relax.

01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:16.831
Hands behind your back.

01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:18.132
Anything you say
can and will be

01:23:18.134 --> 01:23:19.867
used against you
in a court of law.

01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:21.702
You have the right
to an attorney,

01:23:21.704 --> 01:23:23.971
to have an attorney present
during any questioning.

01:23:23.973 --> 01:23:25.306
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

01:23:25.308 --> 01:23:26.590
one will be provided...
