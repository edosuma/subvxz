-You don't even cook it.

10:07.804 --> 10:09.845
-Hi.
-[Alice] Hi.

10:09.845 --> 10:11.053
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:11.053 --> 10:13.762
Oh, u-uh, Lena, this is,
uh, Bette and Alice.

10:13.762 --> 10:15.345
It's really good
to meet you both.

10:15.345 --> 10:17.220
-You, too.
-Yeah, nice to meet you.

10:19.512 --> 10:22.303
Okay, uh, I'm gonna...
I'll pick up my takeout order.

10:22.303 --> 10:23.804
It was nice
to meet you.

10:23.804 --> 10:25.011
-Nice to meet you.
-I'll, uh,

10:25.011 --> 10:26.261
-see you at the bar.
-Yeah, yeah.

10:26.261 --> 10:29.053
[music playing faintly]

10:31.095 --> 10:32.970
-Stop.
-I didn't say anything.

10:32.970 --> 10:34.637
You two seem cozy.

10:34.637 --> 10:35.679
-We're not.
-Oh.

10:35.679 --> 10:37.595
So where exactly

10:37.595 --> 10:38.804
did you meet Lena?

10:38.804 --> 10:40.053
She is a bartender at Atlas.

10:40.053 --> 10:43.261
Oh. I haven't been there
in a long time.

10:43.261 --> 10:45.637
Well, why would you? It's not
the same. It's a sports bar.

10:45.637 --> 10:47.595
Why are you hanging out
at a sports bar?

10:47.595 --> 10:49.387
Uh...

10:49.387 --> 10:50.929
I-I bought it.

10:50.929 --> 10:53.387
-Wait, what?
-What?

10:53.387 --> 10:56.095
I'm gonna flip it, and I'm
gonna make it a gay bar again.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.136
That's amazing.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.345
-Right?
-That's really impulsive.

11:01.345 --> 11:02.804
Um...

11:06.762 --> 11:10.053
that I'm, I'm-I'm-I'm, I'm
laying down roots again, Bette.

11:10.053 --> 11:12.136
No. We are. We are... Aren't we?

11:12.136 --> 11:14.178
Well, I just, I don't know,
I just don't think

11:14.178 --> 11:18.387
you should make any kind
of life-changing decisions

11:18.387 --> 11:20.345
when you're heartbroken.
That's all.

11:20.345 --> 11:21.679
I'm fine.

11:21.679 --> 11:24.136
Okay. My bad.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.512
Maybe, though, don't shit
where you eat, with...

11:30.512 --> 11:33.887
[chuckles] Yeah, that I would
definitely not recommend.

11:36.053 --> 11:38.762
[school bell ringing]

11:38.762 --> 11:41.720
[indistinct shouting, laughter]

11:41.720 --> 11:43.887
I'll catch up with y'all later.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.637
I wanted to ask you about
something I read on Twitter

11:47.637 --> 11:49.178
last night, Ange-munch.

11:49.178 --> 11:50.887
-No. Fuck off.
-I heard

11:50.887 --> 11:53.303
that your mom slept with
everyone on the school board.

11:53.303 --> 11:56.553
I always thought you were
an affirmative action kid.

11:56.553 --> 11:58.887
But it turns out your mom
is just a fucking slut

11:58.887 --> 12:01.929
and everyone knows it.

12:06.929 --> 12:09.303
[Sophie] What's wrong with you,
girl? You look like shit.

12:09.303 --> 12:11.428
[Finley] I had
a weird morning with Rebecca.

12:11.428 --> 12:13.387
-[Sophie] What happened?
-We wake up,

12:13.387 --> 12:15.220
and I think
we're gonna have breakfast,

12:15.220 --> 12:17.178
-so I try to act normal and...
-Ooh, I know

12:17.178 --> 12:19.136
-that's hard for you.
-Very.

12:19.136 --> 12:21.303
-Mm-hmm.
-And then she's like,

12:21.303 --> 12:24.679
"Yo, I got to go to church."

12:24.679 --> 12:26.345
On a Tuesday.

12:26.345 --> 12:27.762
Okay.

12:27.762 --> 12:29.261
What, you don't think
that's fucked up?

12:29.261 --> 12:30.762
Mm, not really.

12:30.762 --> 12:33.887
Dude, we've been
fudging all night.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.929
[laughs]
Yeah, I get that.

12:36.929 --> 12:39.679
And then she went to
church and prayed.

12:39.679 --> 12:41.220
To, like, Jesus.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.136
Ooh. Where does she go?

12:43.136 --> 12:45.136
I don't know. It-it reminded me
of The Mickey Mouse Club.

12:45.136 --> 12:47.220
Oh, you a little stupid.
You mean MCC?

12:47.220 --> 12:48.470
-Yes.
-Ah, that place

12:48.470 --> 12:49.553
is on my venue list.

12:49.553 --> 12:51.303
Do you want to scope
it out with me?

12:51.303 --> 12:52.679
-No.
-[sighs]

12:52.679 --> 12:55.178
Dude, we're gonna, like,
burn if we go in there.

12:55.178 --> 12:57.303
We ain't gonna burn, fool.

12:57.303 --> 12:58.679
Okay, fine.

12:58.679 --> 13:00.970
But only because I want
to be your flower girl.

13:00.970 --> 13:02.970
[laughs] Oh, not
in those shorts. Burn 'em.

13:02.970 --> 13:04.804
These are my nice cutoffs.

13:04.804 --> 13:06.303
Not today.

13:12.470 --> 13:15.970
What happened?
Did-did they expel me?

13:15.970 --> 13:18.095
They suspended you.

13:19.011 --> 13:20.887
And Missy?

13:20.887 --> 13:23.512
Missy will probably get
a stern talking to.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.637
That makes...
That makes no sense.

13:25.637 --> 13:27.679
Sh-Sh...

13:29.929 --> 13:32.178
Fuck these people.

13:33.845 --> 13:36.261
Fuck these people.

13:43.136 --> 13:45.929
Look, Missy is gonna get away
with a lot in life,

13:45.929 --> 13:47.512
and you won't.

13:47.512 --> 13:50.762
Okay? The rules are different
for you, and you know that.

13:50.762 --> 13:52.512
I know.

13:52.512 --> 13:55.178
It sucks.

13:55.178 --> 13:56.512
I know

13:56.512 --> 13:58.512
it's not fair, okay?

13:58.512 --> 14:00.387
But the only way
to survive the system

14:00.387 --> 14:02.553
is to understand how it works.

14:02.553 --> 14:04.720
And then you stay ahead of it.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.970
And I know
that's shitty.

14:06.970 --> 14:09.512
And I'm sorry.

14:09.512 --> 14:11.720
I thought you'd be mad.

14:13.303 --> 14:14.553
I am.

14:14.553 --> 14:16.261
I'm angry that
this happened to you,

14:16.261 --> 14:17.387
and I couldn't prevent it.

14:17.387 --> 14:18.637
And I am fucking enraged

14:18.637 --> 14:20.136
that the world works like this.

14:20.136 --> 14:22.679
But there are two things
you need to take away from this.

14:22.679 --> 14:25.720
One, you are too good
for this place.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.845
And two,
you cannot,

14:27.845 --> 14:30.887
under any circumstances,
hit people.

14:30.887 --> 14:33.720
You got that?

14:33.720 --> 14:36.720
Yes. Yes, ma'am.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.470
I love you.

14:40.470 --> 14:43.303
I love you, too.

14:43.303 --> 14:45.512
Let's go.

14:45.512 --> 14:47.553
I got it.

14:49.679 --> 14:52.762
[audience applauding]

14:56.053 --> 14:57.679
[whooping]

14:57.679 --> 14:59.303
Thank you so much!

14:59.303 --> 15:00.470
Welcome back.

15:00.470 --> 15:03.220
So my next guest
is one of my gay heroes.

15:03.220 --> 15:05.804
And if she's not one of yours,
we cannot be friends.

15:05.804 --> 15:08.428
Uh, ladies and gentlemen
and everyone in between--

15:08.428 --> 15:10.929
her coffee is an Americano
with a little bit

15:10.929 --> 15:13.303
of almond milk
and not a single sugar,

15:13.303 --> 15:15.095
'cause she's better
than the rest of us--

15:15.095 --> 15:17.387
please welcome
America's gay sweetheart

15:17.387 --> 15:20.095
-Megan Rapinoe!
-[audience cheering]

15:20.095 --> 15:22.762
-[lively music playing]
-Yes!

15:25.595 --> 15:28.303
[both cheering]

15:28.303 --> 15:29.553
-I got to hug her.
-No.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.595
-I got to tell her
I love her, dude.
-No.

15:31.595 --> 15:33.804
[cheering]

15:33.804 --> 15:36.303
-So great.
-Okay.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.720
-So great having you here.
-Oh,

15:37.720 --> 15:39.637
-my pleasure.
-Oh, so, okay,

15:39.637 --> 15:42.053
I'm gonna get into
your legendary soccer career,

15:42.053 --> 15:44.970
but before we do that,
I would love to hear

15:44.970 --> 15:47.136
your coming out story,
if you're willing to share.

15:47.136 --> 15:48.470
-Of course.
-[audience cheers]

15:48.470 --> 15:49.804
Yeah, right?

15:49.804 --> 15:51.261
Go, gays!

15:51.261 --> 15:53.178
Um, well, I didn't realize

15:53.178 --> 15:55.470
that I was gay growing up,

15:55.470 --> 15:57.595
which, looking back,
is a big shock.

15:57.595 --> 16:00.345
I didn't really figure it out
for myself until college.

16:00.345 --> 16:02.970
-Oh. So...
-So, yeah, it was--

16:02.970 --> 16:04.470
That kid?

16:04.470 --> 16:05.804
-That kid didn't know?
-[sighs]

16:05.804 --> 16:07.011
-[audience] Aw...
-[Rapinoe] I know.

16:07.011 --> 16:08.470
-[Alice] Really?
-Well, I mean, listen.

16:08.470 --> 16:10.470
I'm from, like,
kind of a small town.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.887
-Okay.
-It was, like, a conservative

16:11.887 --> 16:14.929
area, so there wasn't
a lot of, like,

16:14.929 --> 16:17.553
hey, there's this, you know,
mommy and daddy option

16:17.553 --> 16:20.387
or this mommy and mommy option
or this daddy and daddy option.

16:20.387 --> 16:21.845
-Sure.
-So there wasn't a lot

16:21.845 --> 16:22.845
-of that going on.
-Right.

16:22.845 --> 16:24.345
So, yeah, we had
some confusion.

16:24.345 --> 16:25.595
Yeah.

16:25.595 --> 16:28.136
Early on. So as soon
as I went to college,

16:28.136 --> 16:31.095
-um, spread my wings on my own,
-Mm-hmm.

16:31.095 --> 16:33.845
I pretty quickly
found out that I was gay.

16:33.845 --> 16:34.845
-Right.
-Yeah.

16:34.845 --> 16:36.845
So that was amazing.

16:36.845 --> 16:38.178
I love that.

16:38.178 --> 16:39.929
It was really great.

16:39.929 --> 16:42.804
And, so who came out first,
you or your twin sister?

16:42.804 --> 16:44.804
Um, well, I came out first.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.178
I told my mom.

16:46.178 --> 16:48.095
Um, and Rachael wasn't there,

16:48.095 --> 16:49.804
but then I told my mom
about Rachael, too.

16:49.804 --> 16:54.136
So you outed your sister
to your mother

16:54.136 --> 16:56.136
-Yeah.
-That's such a nice thing
to do to your sister.

16:56.136 --> 16:58.345
Yeah, well, I didn't
want her to have to take on

16:58.345 --> 16:59.887
-the responsibility, so...
-True.

16:59.887 --> 17:02.261
If you could say anything
to that little kid,

17:02.261 --> 17:03.553
what would you say?

17:03.553 --> 17:04.929
You're gay!

17:04.929 --> 17:07.053
-Oh, yeah, well, that's... yes.
-Obviously!

17:07.053 --> 17:08.553
You're a big lesbian, um...

17:08.553 --> 17:11.095
And it's wonderful
and you're beautiful.

17:11.095 --> 17:12.595
And you're gonna love it.

17:12.595 --> 17:14.053
And it's, it's
gonna be great.

17:14.053 --> 17:15.595
-Oh...
-It's like, it's better.

17:15.595 --> 17:17.220
And you get yourself
out into the light.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.136
-Yes, well said.
-Yeah.

17:19.136 --> 17:23.053
Um, okay, and what's
the gayest thing

17:23.053 --> 17:25.512
that has ever happened
in the locker room?

17:25.512 --> 17:28.428
[audience oohing]

17:28.428 --> 17:30.845
[cheering]

17:30.845 --> 17:32.637
-Me, obviously.
-Yeah, right.

17:32.637 --> 17:33.887
-Besides me?
-Yes.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.595
Um...

17:35.595 --> 17:37.595
our celebrations
were pretty gay.

17:37.595 --> 17:39.053
-Really?
-If you think about it,

17:39.053 --> 17:41.303
it's, like, champagne
sprayed everywhere.

17:41.303 --> 17:42.970
-Everyone's in their sports bra.
-Oh.

17:42.970 --> 17:46.178
Everyone just jumping
on each other.

17:46.178 --> 17:48.762
Oh, so it's like
a lesbian fantasy.

17:48.762 --> 17:50.178
-[Rapinoe] Yeah. Yeah.
-[Alice] Yeah.

17:50.178 --> 17:51.762
Okay, have there been

17:51.762 --> 17:54.762
any surprising hookups
on the team?

17:54.762 --> 17:56.929
[audience whooping]

17:56.929 --> 17:59.095
It's just you and I here.
You can tell me.

17:59.095 --> 18:00.136
We're just

18:00.136 --> 18:01.595
-totally alone.
-Lips sealed.

18:01.595 --> 18:02.804
-Yeah, like...
-Just us?

18:02.804 --> 18:05.261
...a one-night stand or
a drunken mistake kind of thing?

18:05.261 --> 18:06.637
-That's what I'm looking for.
-Yeah.

18:06.637 --> 18:09.470
I mean, I don't think
they would call them mistakes,

18:09.470 --> 18:12.261
but there's been some,
some incidents,

18:12.261 --> 18:13.553
-for sure.
-I knew it.

18:13.553 --> 18:15.095
-I knew it.
-I know, yeah.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.220
We're not gonna name names,
but you know who you are.

18:17.220 --> 18:19.095
-No... Yeah.
-Yeah.

18:19.095 --> 18:20.970
All of you know who you are.

18:20.970 --> 18:22.804
It's not me, of course.

18:22.804 --> 18:24.720
-Ah, that's so exciting.
-Yeah.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.512
Uh, who is
your celebrity crush?

18:27.512 --> 18:28.929
I'm gonna go first: you.

18:28.929 --> 18:32.428
-[cheering]
-Uh... but, yeah.

18:32.428 --> 18:33.845
-But, no, really, I'm just--
-Well--

18:33.845 --> 18:35.345
You can answer your side.
You can go next.

18:35.345 --> 18:36.845
Now it's gonna seem like I'm
just saying it because...

18:36.845 --> 18:38.470
No, I'm just right here.
Don't... no pressure.

18:38.470 --> 18:40.136
-It's you, so now--
-What...?

18:40.136 --> 18:42.136
-It's you.
-Megan.

18:42.136 --> 18:43.679
[Rapinoe]
Alice, are you kidding?

18:43.679 --> 18:44.970
Of course.

18:44.970 --> 18:46.845
[Alice]
Um, we will be right back

18:46.845 --> 18:48.303
with Megan to talk about

18:48.303 --> 18:50.220
equal pay in sports

18:50.220 --> 18:52.303
and her new partnership

She's my ex-wife.

28:31.178 --> 28:33.053
Well, she's also
your ex-friend.

28:33.053 --> 28:35.637
Okay, but I don't want her
to know that I miss her.

28:35.637 --> 28:38.720
[sighs] Did you not just
tell me this morning--

28:38.720 --> 28:39.804
Yes. I told you.

28:39.804 --> 28:41.887
I didn't want
her  to know.

28:41.887 --> 28:45.428
[sighs]
Well, she misses you, too.

28:46.470 --> 28:47.428
Did she say that?

28:47.428 --> 28:48.428
Well, no,

28:48.428 --> 28:50.845
but... I can tell.

28:52.136 --> 28:53.887
I can't just flip a switch
and forget what happened.

28:53.887 --> 28:57.595
I know. I'm sorry.
It's just...

28:57.595 --> 28:59.720
[sighs]
She was your friend first.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.470
Why are you
pushing this?

29:01.470 --> 29:03.011
Because I get it.

29:03.011 --> 29:05.011
You know? I dated
my best friend, too,

29:05.011 --> 29:06.553
as you know,
and when we broke up,

29:06.553 --> 29:09.095
-it was very painful.
-You would really be

29:09.095 --> 29:13.512
okay if me and Gigi were just

29:13.512 --> 29:15.970
gal-pal-ing around town,

29:15.970 --> 29:18.303
-having fun...
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

29:18.303 --> 29:21.011
I could see it.
Plain as day.

29:21.011 --> 29:25.261
I could see a brunch,
I could see a mani-pedi.

29:25.261 --> 29:26.595
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

29:26.595 --> 29:28.345
I don't love a spa.

29:28.345 --> 29:31.345
But, yeah, I am not threatened
at all by a casual...

29:31.345 --> 29:34.303
-public hang.
-[chuckles] Okay.

29:34.303 --> 29:36.053
I'm... so sure.

29:36.053 --> 29:39.637
I'm serious. All I want
is for you to be happy.

29:39.637 --> 29:40.929
It's all I ever want.

29:40.929 --> 29:43.303
Well, you're very, very sweet.

29:43.303 --> 29:44.470
Thank you.

29:44.470 --> 29:46.804
I love you so much.

29:46.804 --> 29:49.136
-And you know what?
-Mm?

29:49.136 --> 29:50.637
I think you're the cool one.

29:50.637 --> 29:52.679
Okay, now I know
you're lying.

29:52.679 --> 29:54.053
No, I think
you're so cool.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.637
You're just a
different kind of cool.

29:55.637 --> 29:58.136
-I'm not cool.
-You're so cool.

30:03.053 --> 30:05.095

30:09.011 --> 30:10.720
Hey.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.095
So, I did a deep dive
on Dale Lewis.

30:12.095 --> 30:15.345
And, uh, you know,
I'm just, uh...

30:15.345 --> 30:16.845
You okay?

30:16.845 --> 30:19.512
I'm really sorry,
I have to cancel.

30:19.512 --> 30:21.261
Something came up.

30:21.261 --> 30:23.178
I'll make it up to you,
I promise.

30:23.178 --> 30:25.178
Oh. Uh, is there anything
I can help you with?

30:25.178 --> 30:26.887
No. No.

30:26.887 --> 30:28.970
I just need some time
to take care of some stuff.

30:28.970 --> 30:30.053
Some personal stuff.

30:30.053 --> 30:32.679
Sure. Yeah.

30:32.679 --> 30:34.512
You should take
Sophie with you.

30:35.929 --> 30:37.845
No, that's okay.

30:37.845 --> 30:39.345
Okay.

30:40.470 --> 30:41.762
See you later, yeah?

Can a friend get

31:38.303 --> 31:42.512
You have good timing. I was just
starting to feel bad for myself.

31:44.261 --> 31:45.595
I'm sorry.

31:47.261 --> 31:49.804
-Such a shitty friend earlier.
-No, you weren't.

Very.

32:03.303 --> 32:04.929
[laughs]

32:04.929 --> 32:07.428
What was I doing?

32:08.679 --> 32:11.970
I just wanted to
forget a little.

32:11.970 --> 32:13.970
I get it.

32:15.720 --> 32:18.804
-Put those in some water?
-Yeah.

32:21.470 --> 32:22.970
There are times I just...

32:22.970 --> 32:24.720
I feel normal,
and then...

32:24.720 --> 32:27.303
the feeling of missing her

32:27.303 --> 32:29.970
just hits me like
a fucking wave.

32:30.887 --> 32:33.387
Are you sure that it's over?

32:33.387 --> 32:35.178
I have divorce papers

32:35.178 --> 32:39.303
sitting in my drawer
right now, so...

32:39.303 --> 32:41.136
pretty sure it's over.

32:41.136 --> 32:44.136
But does she know that you're
still in love with her?

32:44.136 --> 32:46.470
I don't think
that matters so much.

32:46.470 --> 32:47.720
Well, it matters a lot

32:47.720 --> 32:49.345
if you still want
to be with her.

32:49.345 --> 32:51.804
The problems we have...

32:53.762 --> 32:56.011
don't involve us
not loving each other.

32:56.011 --> 32:57.595
Hmm.

32:59.970 --> 33:02.929
Ah, I just want to
feel normal again.

33:02.929 --> 33:04.595
Just give me
some good news.

33:04.595 --> 33:07.804
Tell me how long it took for
you to feel normal after Tina.

33:07.804 --> 33:10.970
Well, you're assuming
that I feel normal now.

33:10.970 --> 33:11.929
You don't?

33:11.929 --> 33:14.637
-No.
-Great.

33:18.553 --> 33:22.261
I still miss the kind of love
that I had with Tina.

33:26.428 --> 33:28.845
It made me feel alive.

33:31.553 --> 33:33.679
Never thought she would
fall in love with someone else.

33:35.553 --> 33:39.053
Everything changed
when she left me.

33:39.053 --> 33:40.720
I mean, my God, my body changed.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.261
-No, it didn't.
-Oh, yeah. It did.

33:42.261 --> 33:46.303
I mean, sometimes I sweat
so much at night,

33:46.303 --> 33:48.804
I feel like I should be sleeping
on a fucking towel.

33:48.804 --> 33:50.095
That's where we are now, Shane.

33:50.095 --> 33:52.345
I should be sleeping
on a towel.

33:52.345 --> 33:54.220
But you're younger,
you'll bounce back faster.

33:54.220 --> 33:56.303
Oh, come on,

some time pass, that's all.

can do it if you want.

35:32.220 --> 35:33.345
Whatever works for you.

35:33.345 --> 35:35.303
-[chuckles] Thank you.
-Your tea.

35:35.303 --> 35:36.970
Thanks.

35:36.970 --> 35:39.011
Yeah. You, too. Bye, T.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.220
So, you are going
to be starting

35:41.220 --> 35:43.512
at Harrington Academy
come Monday morning.

35:43.512 --> 35:46.887
Great. Same assholes,
different zip code.

35:46.887 --> 35:49.929
-[sighs] Where are we?
-[Dani] If Milner's team

35:49.929 --> 35:51.470
-is smart--
-[Pierce] Which they are.

35:51.470 --> 35:55.178
They'll use yesterday's incident
to attack you on education.

35:55.178 --> 35:56.261
Bring it on.

35:56.261 --> 35:58.345
You cannot be reactive.

35:58.345 --> 36:00.929
You have to just take a
deep breath, count to three.

36:00.929 --> 36:02.512
You know, whatever
you have to do.

36:02.512 --> 36:04.970
This is an opportunity for you
to clarify your position

36:04.970 --> 36:08.220
on education, which,
as it stands, is murky.

36:08.220 --> 36:09.512
Murky? How's it murky?

36:09.512 --> 36:11.345
I mean, he wants to pour money
into charter schools,

36:11.345 --> 36:13.929
and I support improving
our public school system.

36:13.929 --> 36:15.053
-What's murky about that?
-Right.

36:15.053 --> 36:16.845
But as long as Angie's
in private school,

36:16.845 --> 36:18.553
your position could come across
as hypocritical.

36:18.553 --> 36:20.804
[Dani] I might have
a solution for that.

36:20.804 --> 36:23.470
There are a few
great public schools

36:23.470 --> 36:24.762
-in your district.
-[Bette] Oh, no.

36:24.762 --> 36:27.762
She needs to be
academically challenged.

36:27.762 --> 36:29.845

for Enriched Studies

36:36.887 --> 36:40.512
60% of the student body is
of a lower socioeconomic class.

36:40.512 --> 36:42.053
Look, I get what
you're trying to do,

36:42.053 --> 36:44.261
but I'm not about to exploit
my daughter in order to improve

36:44.261 --> 36:45.679

of the campaign.

You can if you want.

36:47.011 --> 36:48.345

36:50.178 --> 36:51.595
I've spoken to the
teachers' union.

36:51.595 --> 36:53.679
They're ready to support
you if you enroll Angie

36:53.679 --> 36:54.720
-in a public school.
-[Bette] Okay,

36:54.720 --> 36:55.970
look, I'm not trotting out
my daughter

36:55.970 --> 36:57.970
in order to win an endorsement.

36:57.970 --> 37:00.970
I will do what I think is best.

37:03.970 --> 37:05.470
Okay.

37:05.470 --> 37:07.679
I will just leave
these here, then,

37:07.679 --> 37:09.512
-in case you change your mind.
-I won't.

37:09.512 --> 37:12.345
-Just in case.
-I'm never gonna look at these.

37:12.345 --> 37:14.762
I can't hear you.
Sorry. Very busy.

37:14.762 --> 37:16.345

Okay.

37:16.345 --> 37:17.679
[Angie clears throat]

37:21.303 --> 37:22.929
Yes?

37:24.136 --> 37:26.261
Will you please look at those?

37:30.220 --> 37:33.345
Harrington is much better
than these schools.

37:33.345 --> 37:34.762
But I don't...
[chuckles softly]

37:34.762 --> 37:36.595
I don't want to check
their diversity box.

37:36.595 --> 37:37.804
And I don't want to be

37:37.804 --> 37:39.762
in their "Look,
we're color-blind" brochures.

37:39.762 --> 37:41.762
-You know?
-Look, I get it, but here's--

37:41.762 --> 37:44.053
No, but public schools
are not like that.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.470
Okay? It's...

37:45.470 --> 37:48.178
-it's different there, you know?
-T and I

37:48.178 --> 37:49.845
chose the best school for you.

37:49.845 --> 37:52.261
Okay? You have to trust
that, as adults,

37:52.261 --> 37:55.804
sometimes we can see
the bigger picture.

37:55.804 --> 37:57.804
Are you sure
it's the best school for me,

37:57.804 --> 38:00.428
or is it actually
the best school for you?

before the break,

41:25.804 --> 41:28.011
we were discussing the
use of public space.

41:28.011 --> 41:32.095
The city of Los Angeles has
a number of vacant buildings

41:32.095 --> 41:33.428
that are falling
into disrepair.

41:33.428 --> 41:36.053
There are several

regarding how to
use that space.

41:37.679 --> 41:40.220
What exactly is your plan?

My plan is to use
those spaces

41:42.345 --> 41:44.512
to bring money and jobs
back to the city.

41:44.512 --> 41:47.512
Look where those buildings are:
Skid Row, Hyde Park,

But the businesses you support

42:30.220 --> 42:32.720

42:59.053 --> 43:00.679

you believe in public schools

would have her?

was not expelled.
