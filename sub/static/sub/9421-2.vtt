WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:04.601
My father worked as a lawyer
for the richest family in New York,

00:04.704 --> 00:07.571
until his plane went down
in long island sound.

00:07.640 --> 00:12.270
My dad left me only two things,
his briefcase and his biggest client,

00:12.746 --> 00:14.179
the Darlings.

00:14.247 --> 00:15.771
Tripp, the empire builder.

00:16.181 --> 00:18.514
I need your help, Nicky. You're the guy.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.145
Letitia,
the sophisticated socialite.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.488
Patrick, the principled politician.

00:23.556 --> 00:26.855
No, I'm not gonna go into a hotel
and give a tranny hooker a check!

00:26.926 --> 00:28.985
Karen,
the professional divorcée.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.496
She's still in love with you, huh?

00:31.564 --> 00:33.293
Brian, the man of God.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.233
I know he's mine, but I can't just
bring him home to my wife and kids!

00:36.302 --> 00:38.532
And Jeremy and Juliet,
the well-behaved twins.

00:38.605 --> 00:39.663
Yeah.

00:39.739 --> 00:42.970
I said I'd never work for them,
but I will for now,

00:43.043 --> 00:46.069
'cause I think one of them may have
murdered my dad.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.950
Money

00:56.022 --> 00:58.149
money makes the world go round

00:58.224 --> 00:59.555
money

00:59.626 --> 01:01.787
money will make you change your sound

01:01.895 --> 01:03.760
if the price is right

01:03.830 --> 01:08.199
if the price is right

01:11.604 --> 01:13.299
if you want paper

01:13.373 --> 01:15.204
if you want gold and silver

01:15.275 --> 01:16.970
learn now not later

01:17.043 --> 01:18.670
people pay for what's familiar

01:18.745 --> 01:22.010
no need to know yourself too well

01:22.082 --> 01:25.984
you can trade in that saga you tell

01:26.052 --> 01:27.212
for the song you know will sell

01:27.287 --> 01:28.914
here you go, sir.

01:31.491 --> 01:34.051
Hey, Lisa, have you seen my blue suit?

01:34.160 --> 01:37.857
Oh, I forgot to pick it up from
the cleaners! Sorry, honey.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.990
Take off your sweater

01:41.301 --> 01:45.203
Maria. Maria.
Do we have wild salmon?

01:45.271 --> 01:46.932
- Yes.
- Poached.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.903
Soupçon of hollandaise on the side.
Steamed broccoli.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.910
But not Al Dente.
He's been making it nearly raw,

01:52.979 --> 01:54.344
tell him to cross-cut the stem.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.210
I don't know why he doesn't know
how to do that.

01:58.184 --> 01:59.412
Damn it!

02:02.455 --> 02:03.820
It was hot.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.787
Money will make you change your sound

02:06.860 --> 02:09.520
if the price is right

02:09.596 --> 02:13.965
you forfeit your style without a fight

02:14.033 --> 02:15.967
who will be your beacon

02:16.035 --> 02:19.664
you know, I can't find anything today.
My wallet, my keys.

02:19.772 --> 02:22.206
A casual observer might assume
you don't really want to go to work.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.435
- There you go.
- Really?

02:23.543 --> 02:24.635
You don't have to do this.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.201
- You know that, right?
- What?

02:26.513 --> 02:29.812
Your dad wasted his life
babysitting the Darlings.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.851
You don't have to do the same thing.
You know that, right?

02:31.918 --> 02:33.579
Come on, Lisa,
we've been through this, okay?

02:33.653 --> 02:36.121
I get to
help a lot of people with a lot of money.

02:37.123 --> 02:40.650
And I'm also trying to find out what
happened to my dad.

02:40.727 --> 02:44.493
- You really think someone killed him?
- I think it seems highly possible, yeah.

02:44.597 --> 02:47.293
Is that why you took this job?
Do you feel like

02:47.400 --> 02:49.061
you have some score to settle
or something?

02:49.135 --> 02:51.262
Look, I don't know, Lisa.
It was a gut decision.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.898
I took it for many reasons, I guess...
None of which are Karen.

02:55.074 --> 02:57.304
Hey, I didn't mention Karen.

02:57.410 --> 03:02.074
Look, I owe my dad something. I just...
I want to find out the truth. Okay?

03:02.715 --> 03:04.239
- Okay.
- All right.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.643
Has that airplane mechanic guy ever
called you back?

03:07.720 --> 03:11.679
Norman Exley? No. I've called him,
like, ten times. Where are my keys?

03:11.791 --> 03:14.521
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.721
And I would get your dad's briefcase
if I knew where you put it.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.320
- Do you know where it is?
- I left it with Daisy.

03:18.398 --> 03:20.059
She's figuring out the combination
for me.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.691
I'm hoping there are some
answers in there.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.629
- Mmm.
- What?

03:25.338 --> 03:26.771
There. Now you're perfect.

03:26.839 --> 03:30.206
- Well, I may look perfect, but...
- Just like the Darlings.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.575
Love you.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.714
Can Freddy be in the picture? Please?

03:41.087 --> 03:42.179
No.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.223
This photo shoot, for better or worse,

03:44.290 --> 03:46.622
is going to launch your brother's
senate campaign.

03:46.693 --> 03:50.629
I'm not going to let you cheapen it
by including your fourth husband.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.665
But mom, his heart is set on this.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.496
My heart was set on your brother
leaving politics altogether

03:55.602 --> 03:57.467
and pursuing a life
of emotional integrity,

03:57.537 --> 03:59.835
but that's not happening either.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.067
The answer is no.

04:02.141 --> 04:05.269
Patrick's romantic habits are a lot
more embarrassing than mine.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.781
I don't see why you can't be on my side
every once in a while.

04:08.848 --> 04:13.012
You've always been stronger than your
older brother, Karen, and you know it.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.950
Don't be disingenuous.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.853
It's not becoming.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.116
- Mrs. Darling?
- Yes, Elizabeth?

04:21.194 --> 04:24.823
The caterers have arrived to discuss
the lunch for the photo shoot tomorrow.

04:24.897 --> 04:28.060
- They're waiting in the kitchen.
- I'll be right up.

04:29.869 --> 04:34.169
Patrick needs me more than you do.
He always has.

04:34.374 --> 04:37.434
I'm not running for senate.
I've decided.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.871
I'm telling my father today.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.149
- And when will you tell your wife?
- About the senate?

04:44.250 --> 04:45.717
No, about us.

04:47.186 --> 04:48.278
Soon.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.453
I promise.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.458
Real soon.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.453
I don't believe you.

04:56.529 --> 04:58.656
I'm just asking my sister
to come home.

04:58.731 --> 04:59.993
I don't want to.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.591
I'm through with daddy paying
for everything

05:02.669 --> 05:05.035
and secretly arranging my life
behind my back.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.232
It makes me feel like...
Well, like, this big.

05:08.441 --> 05:09.806
Like I'm living on a train set.

05:10.376 --> 05:11.741
That sounds kind of cool, actually.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.110
No! I want to be normal-sized
and independent.

05:15.381 --> 05:17.008
Well, then, can you at least
get a hotel room

05:17.083 --> 05:19.711
that isn't the size
of a frigging postage stamp?

05:19.786 --> 05:22.152
I tried to get the penthouse suite,
but it was taken.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.745
- Bummer.
- Yeah.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.259
- Who's the mutt?
- This is Bingles.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.557
I found him the day I left home.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.961
- He is my totem.
- Are you allowed to have dogs here?

05:32.031 --> 05:35.899
No, but if I were in the penthouse,
they'd be making exceptions.

05:35.968 --> 05:39.529
Would you please be so kind as
to investigate who's staying in there?

05:39.605 --> 05:42.369
- I'd be so grateful.
- I'm on it.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.773
Thank you.

05:47.413 --> 05:49.779
- To independence.
- To independence.

05:50.950 --> 05:53.043
You're going back to your mother today
and that's final.

05:53.119 --> 05:56.486
- I want to live with you, daddy.
- Well, you can't.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.284
And stop calling me daddy.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.156
I lied to my wife and daughters
last night. I told...

06:01.227 --> 06:03.593
Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry, father.

06:05.398 --> 06:08.367
I lied to my wife and daughters last
night and told them that you were

06:08.468 --> 06:12.632
an orphan whose parents were killed
in a bullet train accident in Sweden.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.866
- What's a bullet train?
- It's none of your business.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.805
The point is,
do you know what my wife would do

06:16.876 --> 06:19.436
if she found out that you talk English?
Or that you're mine?

06:20.380 --> 06:23.406
- Mommy is not gonna take me back.
- She'll take you back.

06:23.483 --> 06:25.849
She'll take you back if I have to shoot
you at her with a Cannon.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.189
Sorry I'm late.
Train got hung up at union square.

06:37.296 --> 06:42.632
Whoa. You have a date with me
and you take the subway?

06:42.702 --> 06:44.966
Usually runs on time.
Trust me, it won't be a problem again.

06:45.037 --> 06:47.562
- Let me set you up with a car.
- No, subway's fine. Thanks.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.198
- 24l7.
- I'm good.

06:50.777 --> 06:52.677
- All right.
- What can I do for you, Tripp?

06:52.745 --> 06:57.375
Well, we have this photo shoot
happening here tomorrow.

06:57.450 --> 07:01.181
We're re-branding the family as "fresh. "

07:01.254 --> 07:02.687
"Hip. "

07:03.222 --> 07:06.521
For Patrick's campaign. It's idiocy.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.891
And since everyone lives here
except Brian,

07:09.962 --> 07:13.864
they figured it'd be a good idea
to have it in the living room.

07:13.966 --> 07:17.265
- So what would you like me to do?
- Just hang around.

07:18.237 --> 07:22.196
Set a tone.
Make sure everybody gets there.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.140
- Sounds simple enough.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:25.878 --> 07:29.177
It's a piece of cake. Here.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.280
What's this?

07:33.352 --> 07:35.513
Well, I used to give some cash
to your dad

07:35.621 --> 07:38.454
- at the beginning of every work week.
- For?

07:40.126 --> 07:43.493
Well, things come up. Trust me.

07:54.941 --> 07:57.102
Well, I thought you said you could
open it up.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.043
I'm a paralegal, Nick,
not a code breaker.

08:00.112 --> 08:01.238
Any calls?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.839
Juliet called. She doesn't want to do
the photo shoot tomorrow.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.577
Here. What? Why?

08:05.651 --> 08:09.553
She says she's a free radical now and
you, of all people, would understand.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.522
- What else?
- Jeremy called.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.020
He wrote with Justin Timberlake
last night.

08:16.095 --> 08:19.064
- He left it on your answering machine.
- Great.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.895
Brian hasn't called to yell at me?
That's surprising.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.936
Actually, he did stop by.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.598
This is your mother's phone number
and address, right?

08:28.674 --> 08:29.641
Mmm-hmm.

08:29.742 --> 08:33.303
Okay. I'm gonna get in touch with your
mom. Everything's gonna be okay.

08:33.412 --> 08:34.777
- All right?
- Okay.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.548
Call for you. It's Norman Exley.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.687
Put him through.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.190
Hello?

08:45.291 --> 08:49.227
Hi, this is Norman Exley.
I hear you've been looking for me.

08:49.795 --> 08:52.161
Look, I know Brian Darling paid you
$ 100,000

08:52.265 --> 08:55.701
for something, Mr. Exley.
I have the canceled checks.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.264
You sure got all your little ducks
in a row there, don't you, chief?

08:59.338 --> 09:01.806
Yeah, I do. What was the money for?

09:01.874 --> 09:05.332
Well, I did a lot of work on your dad's
plane over the years.

09:05.411 --> 09:09.108
Sometimes he'd show up early when
I'd still be spot-checking the engine,

09:09.181 --> 09:13.015
- and I'd, you know, overhear things.
- Yeah. What kind of things?

09:13.085 --> 09:14.643
Come on, Mr. Exley. You can tell me

09:14.720 --> 09:16.381
or later on you're going to be
talking to the police.

09:16.455 --> 09:19.891
Okay. One time I heard your dad
talking to reverend Darling

09:19.959 --> 09:21.722
about his little secret love baby.

09:21.827 --> 09:24.921
So, I gave the reverend,
you know, a call.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.593
We came to an understanding.

09:29.669 --> 09:32.900
So you blackmailed Brian Darling
about his illegitimate son?

09:32.972 --> 09:35.031
Yes, sir. I'm not proud...

09:35.107 --> 09:37.871
Brian Darling never paid you
to sabotage my father's plane?

09:37.977 --> 09:40.639
No, sir. Not in any way, shape, or form.

09:42.048 --> 09:44.812
Thank you for your honesty, Mr. Exley.

09:45.351 --> 09:48.047
- Mr. George?
- Yeah.

09:52.058 --> 09:56.791
A lot of times when your dad took the
plane, he brought along his lady-friend.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.294
- Letitia Darling?
- Yes, sir.

10:00.399 --> 10:03.027
I know I'm talking out of school
here but...

10:03.102 --> 10:07.038
If I was Tripp Darling, I sure would
have found that troublesome.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.401
Real troublesome.

10:25.252 --> 10:27.379
- Good morning, Clark.
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Darling.

10:27.455 --> 10:28.513
Enjoying that book?

10:28.589 --> 10:31.057
It's great. Thanks for giving it to me.
I'm not sure I understand it...

10:31.125 --> 10:34.288
Oh, now don't take it too seriously.
Just enjoy it, but stick with it.

10:34.362 --> 10:36.193
- I'm going to, sir.
- The scene at the end

10:36.263 --> 10:37.730
when xenophon crests the Mountain

10:37.798 --> 10:40.062
and the water stretches out
in front of him...

10:40.234 --> 10:44.534
Thalatta! Thalatta! The sea! The sea!
Stunning.

10:46.307 --> 10:47.331
Tish went out this morning?

10:47.408 --> 10:50.343
Yes, sir.
I took her to forest lawn cemetery.

10:55.616 --> 10:57.243
Keep it even.

11:00.955 --> 11:03.389
Hey, could you maybe tell me
who's staying here?

11:03.457 --> 11:07.587
Jeremy Darling?
What the hell are you doing here?

11:07.795 --> 11:11.424
Natalie Kimpton! Jeez...

11:12.133 --> 11:13.430
You look amazing.

11:13.567 --> 11:18.470
- You look... I got... I gotta go.
- No. No. No. Stay!

11:19.106 --> 11:21.939
God, I haven't seen you since
your sister freaked out on me.

11:22.009 --> 11:24.671
I know, it's been, like, a year.

11:25.446 --> 11:29.314
What a crap blizzard that was. Sit!
How did you get up here?

11:29.383 --> 11:32.113
I thought this penthouse
was maximum privacy.

11:32.186 --> 11:36.555
Well, I told the elevator girl that
she could sing back-up with me

11:36.624 --> 11:38.785
on this project I'm doing
with Justin Timberlake.

11:38.893 --> 11:43.853
- Oh, you're writing songs now?
- Yeah, you know, whatever, I get by.

11:43.931 --> 11:47.492
- Natalie!
- Is that your mom?

11:47.768 --> 11:51.864
Yeah. She's trading in her third face
for a fourth and a brand-new ass.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.736
So, of course, I'm stuck
here taking care of her like a slave.

11:54.842 --> 11:58.209
And her face, her face looks
like a grape smushed on the sidewalk.

11:58.312 --> 12:00.473
- It's so bad.
- Natalie, come here!

12:00.614 --> 12:03.981
Carlos, mommy wants something! God!

12:05.286 --> 12:08.016
- That sucks. I gotta go.
- No! No, no, no! Stay!

12:08.089 --> 12:10.717
Stay! Stay! Stay! Come here. Please.

12:10.791 --> 12:13.555
It'll be just like old times, you know?
Remember St. Barts...

12:15.596 --> 12:17.962
- You remember St. Barts?
- Okay, just...

12:29.477 --> 12:31.638
I don't want to run for senate.

12:32.313 --> 12:34.941
- I want to get out of politics.
- Okay.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.382
What about the photo shoot?

12:38.486 --> 12:40.351
I already had my office call and cancel.

12:40.421 --> 12:44.118
Because I'm not running, so what's
the point, right? I mean, I'm not.

12:45.926 --> 12:48.690
- The family's had...
- I'm not the family, dad.

12:50.498 --> 12:53.126
- I'm me.
- Yeah, you're you. You.

12:54.001 --> 12:56.231
And you could be president
of the United States.

12:56.303 --> 13:00.262
I don't want to be president!
I let you push me into law school,

13:00.341 --> 13:01.467
then the Attorney General's office.

13:01.542 --> 13:05.000
I won't let it happen again.
I can't be any more clear.

13:06.580 --> 13:07.911
Can't you?

13:15.356 --> 13:20.521
If you're worried about some things
coming to light in the election,

13:22.863 --> 13:25.024
we can handle that. Together.

13:26.901 --> 13:32.362
You know, these things have a way
of coming to the surface anyway.

13:34.008 --> 13:36.977
They're like splinters. They want out.

13:37.945 --> 13:40.106
That's not why I don't want to run.

13:40.481 --> 13:43.644
Come here. Come here. Come.

13:47.388 --> 13:50.915
Contrary to popular belief,

13:50.991 --> 13:54.017
history is not made by great men.

13:54.762 --> 13:56.593
It takes more than one man
to change the world.

13:56.664 --> 13:59.565
It takes more than one generation.
It takes a family.

13:59.633 --> 14:01.794
Dad, I don't wanna make history.

14:01.902 --> 14:04.530
I just want to live my life, okay?

14:04.605 --> 14:08.041
Patty, you're the eldest son.
You're the only one

14:08.108 --> 14:10.599
who can carry on our name
in public service.

14:10.678 --> 14:13.442
You're the scion
of the Darling family tree.

14:14.849 --> 14:15.816
Please.

14:17.151 --> 14:20.917
Make me proud. Make yourself proud.

14:30.097 --> 14:33.589
- We're home!
- Hey.

14:34.001 --> 14:35.969
Hi. You must be Brian junior.

14:36.270 --> 14:39.296
- I'm Lisa. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

14:39.373 --> 14:41.136
Our daughter, Kiki, is in the living room
watching a movie.

14:41.242 --> 14:42.732
- Do you wanna join her?
- Okay.

14:42.810 --> 14:45.040
- She's right around the corner.
- All right.

14:47.615 --> 14:49.446
- You're kidding me, right?
- What?

14:49.717 --> 14:52.880
Look, Lisa, I told you that Daisy already
watched him for two hours at the office.

14:52.987 --> 14:54.750
I'm fine watching him.
What I'm not fine with is that

14:54.822 --> 14:56.790
the Darlings think this is part
of your job.

14:56.891 --> 14:58.324
- No. You and me both...
- You're a lawyer! Hey.

14:58.392 --> 14:59.916
- I know!
- You always said

15:00.127 --> 15:01.458
your dad sacrificed his family

15:01.528 --> 15:03.428
to take care of every crazy thing
the Darlings wanted.

15:03.497 --> 15:04.623
And now here you are,

15:04.698 --> 15:06.825
you're bringing home this kid.
You're babysitting!

15:06.901 --> 15:08.869
- Look... Lisa, I know this sounds crazy.
- You know that, right?

15:08.936 --> 15:12.099
But right now this is the best way for
me to get to the bottom of things, okay?

15:12.239 --> 15:14.070
I need to do my job.

15:15.809 --> 15:17.970
- That's Karen.
- Of course.

15:18.245 --> 15:21.612
Take it. She probably
wants you to wash her pet tiger

15:21.715 --> 15:25.344
or insure her solid-gold toilet
or something very reasonable like that.

15:25.786 --> 15:27.048
It could be important.

15:27.121 --> 15:29.453
Hey, I said take it. Tell her "hi. "

15:31.725 --> 15:33.022
Hey, Karen, what's up?

15:33.093 --> 15:36.961
Nick. Hi. It's me.
Can you hear me?

15:37.031 --> 15:38.794
No, not really.

15:39.366 --> 15:40.663
I need you to do me a favor.

15:40.734 --> 15:41.758
What?

15:41.835 --> 15:45.327
- I need you to do me a favor!
What's up, baby?

15:45.739 --> 15:49.300
- Nothing, nothing. I love you!
Yeah, I love you, too.

15:49.376 --> 15:51.708
I need you to tell Freddy he can't be in
the picture tomorrow.

15:51.779 --> 15:53.212
Mommy says no

15:53.280 --> 15:56.010
and I just don't have the heart
to tell him.

15:56.216 --> 15:57.683
Do you think you can handle that?

15:57.751 --> 16:00.311
Look, Karen.
It isn't really my job to tell your fiancé

16:00.387 --> 16:03.288
he can't be in some photo shoot
for a fashion magazine.

16:03.357 --> 16:07.418
I never thought it was your job, Nick.
I'm asking you as a friend.

16:08.829 --> 16:09.853
Nick?

16:11.231 --> 16:12.960
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Thank you.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.557
You're my hero.

16:14.635 --> 16:16.193
Okay, bye.

16:16.270 --> 16:19.364
That did sound very, very,
very important.

16:19.506 --> 16:20.473
Yeah.

16:20.574 --> 16:22.872
Look, if you are ever going to get
to the bottom of things,

16:22.943 --> 16:25.377
you need to stop avoiding the obvious.

16:25.713 --> 16:27.681
- Like talk to Letitia?
- Yeah.

16:28.015 --> 16:29.175
I won't let you do it.

16:29.450 --> 16:32.283
I won't let you push that boy
into the senate

16:32.353 --> 16:35.186
for the sake of your almighty
family name.

16:35.756 --> 16:36.916
You've pushed him his whole life

16:37.024 --> 16:39.925
to try to make up for what happened
to your brother, Kenneth.

16:41.228 --> 16:43.287
- It's not right.
- It is what's best for him.

16:43.564 --> 16:45.725
You know he has issues

16:45.799 --> 16:47.096
- that will come out...
- Issues?

16:47.167 --> 16:51.126
Our married son has affairs
with transsexuals,

16:51.205 --> 16:54.436
and you stand there calling
them "issues"?

16:55.609 --> 16:58.169
Don't lecture me in that tone.

16:58.278 --> 17:02.237
Can't someone in this family,
besides me, live in the light

17:02.316 --> 17:04.876
of the simple truth? Someone, anyone?

17:05.050 --> 17:08.214
Oh, God. I wish Dutch was here.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.789
Why? Why do you wish
Dutch were here?

17:09.857 --> 17:12.826
Because I miss the days when
there was somebody in this family

17:12.893 --> 17:16.260
who knew the difference
between power and love.

17:19.366 --> 17:20.924
In this family?

17:27.241 --> 17:29.106
You know what I mean.

17:37.117 --> 17:39.677
Oh, God.

17:55.531 --> 17:58.056
Excuse me? Thank you.

18:01.537 --> 18:04.165
So... who's up there?

18:04.339 --> 18:05.363
Hmm?

18:05.441 --> 18:07.409
You went up to find out
who's in the penthouse!

18:07.476 --> 18:09.774
Oh, it's... it's nobody. It's...

18:10.913 --> 18:12.608
- Some chef.
- A chef?

18:12.881 --> 18:15.645
What kind of chef stays at
the penthouse at the argyle hotel?

18:15.751 --> 18:19.380
It's some dude from Belgium. He's
here to cook for the united nations.

18:19.455 --> 18:20.786
What?

18:20.856 --> 18:22.949
God, this place is really changing.

18:23.025 --> 18:26.188
- See you tomorrow at the shoot?
- Oh, no, you won't.

18:26.762 --> 18:28.389
- Why not?
- Because I won't be appearing

18:28.464 --> 18:30.398
- with the family anymore.
- Ah, come on, Jules.

18:30.466 --> 18:32.832
There's gonna be lions. Live lions.

18:32.935 --> 18:34.493
- Come on.
- I don't care.

18:34.570 --> 18:35.696
- Thank you.
- Okay.

18:35.771 --> 18:37.534
I'm on my own now.

18:37.973 --> 18:39.998
Are you paying for this place
out of your own pocket?

18:40.075 --> 18:42.100
- What do you mean?
- I mean, this isn't independence.

18:42.177 --> 18:45.146
- Okay? Dad's paying for it.
- What's your problem?

18:46.482 --> 18:49.110
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look.
You should... you should...

18:50.018 --> 18:53.317
You should come tomorrow
and you should be in the picture.

18:54.022 --> 18:55.751
And then you should come home.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.622
We should both get the hell out of here.

19:01.897 --> 19:03.057
Later.

19:03.332 --> 19:05.562
Have you always known
about the affair?

19:05.701 --> 19:08.670
No, actually, I just found out
a few days ago.

19:09.938 --> 19:12.907
The two of you were real good
at maintaining appearances.

19:13.041 --> 19:18.206
Well, it started as a necessity
and then became a lifestyle.

19:19.515 --> 19:20.982
Who told you?

19:21.984 --> 19:24.214
- Karen?
- Yeah.

19:27.623 --> 19:29.386
- Does Tripp know?
- Why?

19:29.491 --> 19:32.551
The police think that my father's plane
may have been tampered with.

19:32.628 --> 19:33.925
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

19:33.996 --> 19:35.964
It's not clear at all.

19:36.965 --> 19:40.332
I mean, we'll know more once
the NTSB reports comes back,

19:40.435 --> 19:43.131
but if Tripp did know about the affair,

19:44.106 --> 19:46.734
I just thought that maybe he...

19:49.044 --> 19:50.011
I see.

19:50.245 --> 19:52.577
No, I have no idea if he knew.

19:53.849 --> 19:58.343
Your father, Nick.
Your father was my great love.

19:58.453 --> 19:59.579
So...

20:01.957 --> 20:05.893
- How could Tripp not have known?
- I know! I've thought the same thing.

20:06.562 --> 20:10.658
But, Nick, for the past forty years,
I've read

20:10.766 --> 20:13.530
every look on his face like it was code,

20:13.602 --> 20:16.969
wondering if he was gonna come down
to bed and ask me or tell me

20:17.072 --> 20:20.439
he knew or... he never did.

20:21.677 --> 20:24.202
Do you think he's capable of murder?

20:30.752 --> 20:34.119
We're all capable of everything.

20:36.091 --> 20:40.050
You know, Tripp's faith in God
has always been shaky.

20:40.329 --> 20:42.695
He puts his faith in facts. He...

20:42.898 --> 20:46.197
He believes in history,
keeps track of everything.

20:46.768 --> 20:49.464
If he did know about the affair,

20:49.538 --> 20:51.836
he would have written about it
in his journal.

20:54.643 --> 20:56.736
He keeps it in his desk.

21:01.283 --> 21:03.410
- And you've never looked at it?
- No, no.

21:03.785 --> 21:08.415
I've always been too frightened
to find out how much I've hurt him.

21:08.590 --> 21:10.023
Why is that?

21:10.926 --> 21:12.188
Because...

21:13.895 --> 21:15.453
I love him, too.

21:25.007 --> 21:26.565
Please tell me
none of the Darlings called.

21:26.642 --> 21:27.904
Just the lion wrangler.

21:27.976 --> 21:29.910
Am I supposed to know
what you're talking about?

21:29.978 --> 21:31.036
No one told you?

21:31.113 --> 21:33.138
Apparently, there are gonna be lions
at the photo shoot.

21:33.215 --> 21:35.046
But you need to figure out
the insurance first.

21:35.117 --> 21:37.950
- Live lions?
- I know. Crazy.

21:38.020 --> 21:39.180
So what do you want me to do?

21:39.254 --> 21:40.915
I guess we should get some
lion insurance.

21:40.989 --> 21:43.287
Did Brian junior's mother
ever call back?

21:43.358 --> 21:45.826
- No.
- And did you solve Juliet's problem

21:45.894 --> 21:48.260
- with the photo shoot?
- When did all this become our job?

21:48.363 --> 21:51.127
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
Tell me about it. I'll see you.

22:16.825 --> 22:18.315
Mr. George?

22:20.696 --> 22:22.186
Hey, Maria.

22:25.801 --> 22:26.768
Yes?

22:27.569 --> 22:31.938
Okay, so look, I just took this journal
from Mr. Darling's desk

22:32.040 --> 22:35.203
and you probably saw me, and I don't
want you to think I was doing

22:35.277 --> 22:39.441
something that I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.

22:39.514 --> 22:42.608
So... I need this, for...

22:42.684 --> 22:45.448
It's something to do with the family.
Very high-priority matter.

22:45.554 --> 22:49.923
I'd appreciate it if we could keep this
between, just in between, you and me,

22:50.659 --> 22:53.423
for the sake of security,
family security.

22:54.596 --> 22:57.963
- Five hundred.
- Five hundred what?

22:58.133 --> 23:00.897
Oh! Yeah! Yeah! Five hundred.
Sure. Here.

23:01.002 --> 23:02.731
Five hundred. Here you go.

23:02.804 --> 23:04.533
Hey, tell you what,
how about a thousand?

23:04.606 --> 23:06.540
Five hundred is plenty.

23:07.342 --> 23:11.711
Okay. All right. Here you go. Fantastic.
Okay. Thank you.

23:11.780 --> 23:14.749
There were quite a few times I walked
in on your father

23:14.816 --> 23:16.511
getting away with things.

23:16.585 --> 23:21.147
He put my daughter alejandra
through college. Med school.

23:25.761 --> 23:27.490
You find anything?

23:27.896 --> 23:30.364
Nothing that indicates
with absolute certainty

23:30.432 --> 23:32.161
that Tripp knew anything
about the affair.

23:32.234 --> 23:35.203
There's lots of stuff in here about
poetry and arctic expeditions,

23:35.303 --> 23:38.795
but barely any mention of dad
or, for that matter, Letitia.

23:38.874 --> 23:40.705
Not even on the day your dad died?

23:40.776 --> 23:44.940
Yeah, actually, that's the one thing
that's kind of odd.

23:45.147 --> 23:47.809
Check it out. Look at this.

23:51.953 --> 23:54.478
- What the heck did that say?
- I don't know.

23:54.923 --> 23:57.949
But why did he cross it out?

23:58.026 --> 24:00.517
Kiki! Hey, Kiki!

24:01.863 --> 24:03.228
- How's he doing?
- He's all right.

24:03.298 --> 24:05.163
I think he's a little discombobulated.

24:05.233 --> 24:07.701
Did you get a hold of his mom
or is he spending the night,

24:07.769 --> 24:10.465
maybe staying forever?
Are we gonna adopt him perhaps?

24:10.539 --> 24:11.801
No, I called her, like, five times.

24:11.873 --> 24:13.636
She never returned.
And the last time I called,

24:13.708 --> 24:16.973
I got this recording
saying the number's out of service.

24:17.712 --> 24:20.078
- Take a look at this.
- What is it?

24:20.615 --> 24:23.641
The kids were drawing pictures
this afternoon.

24:23.718 --> 24:27.154
He did this one of his mom
at this giant waterfall.

24:27.222 --> 24:28.883
Well, he's a better artist than Tripp.

24:28.957 --> 24:32.859
He said this is in Brazil,
which is where she's going.

24:33.195 --> 24:34.492
She's going to Brazil?

24:34.563 --> 24:38.192
- Yeah, I thought it was imagination.
- Great.

24:38.266 --> 24:39.290
You know? I mean...

24:39.367 --> 24:43.667
Well, do me a favor and imagine that
she hasn't already gone to Brazil.

24:44.706 --> 24:46.401
- She's gone.
- Who?

24:46.942 --> 24:49.638
- The mother of your son.
- What are you talking about?

24:49.711 --> 24:51.440
That address you gave me?
I just came from there, Brian.

24:51.513 --> 24:55.847
The landlady said she left last night,
sold everything, went to Brazil.

24:56.485 --> 24:59.010
What are you gonna do about the kid?

24:59.087 --> 25:02.955
You know, it's funny, Brian, I just came
here to ask you the same question!

25:03.024 --> 25:05.117
You know, your father
was a cash-sucking leech.

25:05.193 --> 25:07.252
But at least he wasn't willfully stupid,

25:07.329 --> 25:10.230
or self-righteous, or whatever it is
that makes you show up here

25:10.298 --> 25:12.766
expecting me to be nice to you.
I'm not gonna claim that kid, Nick.

25:12.834 --> 25:14.859
Even if you leave him on my frigging
doorstep, okay?

25:14.936 --> 25:16.870
Good night, God bless.

25:25.580 --> 25:28.674
Why doesn't daddy live here?
It's so much bigger.

25:29.618 --> 25:33.247
Well, that's because he lives
near the church where he works.

25:33.321 --> 25:36.085
But today he has to be here
to get his picture taken.

25:36.157 --> 25:38.887
- Come on.
- Daddy doesn't want me, does he?

25:39.027 --> 25:41.052
Hey. Brian, listen.

25:41.496 --> 25:44.863
Sometimes daddies get confused.

25:44.933 --> 25:48.300
But sometimes, when a daddy
gets around his own daddy,

25:49.905 --> 25:52.840
things get less confusing
very, very quickly.

25:55.310 --> 25:58.074
Hey, I want to show you something.
Come here. Up.

26:00.582 --> 26:02.277
- What is it?
- You'll see.

26:08.456 --> 26:09.821
Welcome to the family, kid.

26:17.260 --> 26:18.420
- Nick!
- Hey.

26:18.495 --> 26:19.757
- Where have you been?
- Where have you been?

26:19.829 --> 26:21.353
I've been living my life.
Where have you been?

26:21.431 --> 26:23.490
You have to tell Freddy
he can't be in the picture.

26:23.567 --> 26:25.228
- I'm sorry, I forgot.
- Nice.

26:25.302 --> 26:27.998
- Who is this?
- Rebecca colfax, family publicist.

26:28.104 --> 26:30.163
- Who are you?
- Nick George, family lawyer.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.141
Oh. Well, this photo is probably
the most important thing

26:33.209 --> 26:34.699
that's gonna happen
in this campaign.

26:34.778 --> 26:37.838
People will be voting for the Darlings
as much as they'll be voting for Patrick.

26:37.914 --> 26:41.077
And Mr. Darling
told me you'd be here to set a tone.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.145
- So get in there and set it.
- Okay.

26:44.921 --> 26:49.551
Hey, Brian. This nice lonely lady
is gonna get you some cake, okay?

26:51.227 --> 26:55.755
- Thank you!
- Can you get it cake?

26:59.102 --> 27:01.195
Freddy, you're a golfer,
so I'm gonna give it to you straight.

27:01.271 --> 27:03.739
- Hit me.
- You can't be in the picture.

27:03.807 --> 27:07.038
- Who says? Karen? Her mother?
- I do.

27:08.244 --> 27:11.008
I'm sorry. It's nothing against you,
it's just family politics.

27:11.114 --> 27:13.605
- You're still in love with her.
- What?

27:14.317 --> 27:16.148
You. You're still in love with her.

27:16.219 --> 27:18.187
Freddy, it's just a picture in a magazine

27:18.288 --> 27:20.347
for women and girls,
what's the big freaking deal?

27:20.423 --> 27:23.392
Fine. You know what? You can keep
me out of the picture, Nick, okay?

27:23.460 --> 27:27.624
But you can't keep me out
of the picture. Got it? Karen is mine.

27:31.735 --> 27:33.600
He's still in love with you.

27:36.006 --> 27:40.306
Hi. Thanks for taking care of that.

27:41.211 --> 27:42.701
Not a problem.

27:43.513 --> 27:45.037
Why didn't you cancel this?

27:45.115 --> 27:47.481
Well, I didn't want to ruin it
for everyone.

27:47.584 --> 27:50.485
And just because we're taking a picture
does not mean that I'm running.

27:50.553 --> 27:52.919
You can't keep pleasing
your father forever.

27:52.989 --> 27:55.617
Tell him no and move on.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.820
- Completely...
- Still no luck with the briefcase, huh?

27:59.896 --> 28:02.126
I've been kind of busy.
I'm just getting around to it.

28:02.232 --> 28:03.199
Yeah? And what's going on with

28:03.299 --> 28:05.199
the Juliet situation?
I haven't seen her here yet.

28:05.335 --> 28:07.235
Oh, that's fine. I solved that one.

28:07.303 --> 28:09.828
- What does that mean?
- You'll see. Bye!

28:15.679 --> 28:17.510
What a circus.

28:18.982 --> 28:22.349
"But yet I know, wherever I go

28:23.286 --> 28:26.585
"that there hath passed away a glory
from the earth"

28:29.426 --> 28:32.657
what a glory your Uncle Kenneth
was, cupcake.

28:38.702 --> 28:41.262
- Who is this girl?
- Bring in the lions!

28:42.005 --> 28:44.371
Beautiful! Hold it.

28:46.076 --> 28:48.601
- Magnificent.
- One minute, dream-kids!

28:49.512 --> 28:51.673
Has anyone seen my journal?

28:52.649 --> 28:53.980
I've been looking for it all morning.

28:54.050 --> 28:56.211
I can't imagine where I could
have set it down. Tish?

28:56.319 --> 28:58.480
No. I haven't seen it, dear.

28:58.555 --> 29:03.219
Have you come across an orange
journal during your stay with us?

29:03.293 --> 29:05.557
What? Do you think I stole it?

29:05.762 --> 29:08.390
- You're... you're not my sister.
- Duh!

29:08.898 --> 29:12.994
- Nick, is this travesty your idea?
- Technically, no, but I did...

29:13.069 --> 29:16.004
- I asked you to set a tone.
- And I'm trying, Tripp, I'm trying. It...

29:16.072 --> 29:17.630
Excuse me.

29:19.242 --> 29:20.971
What do you think you're doing
bringing him here

29:21.044 --> 29:22.477
where my whole family can see him,

29:22.545 --> 29:24.979
- where my father can see him?
- I'm sorry. Is that a problem?

29:25.048 --> 29:26.413
- Hi, daddy.
- Shh!

29:26.516 --> 29:28.541
Who is this unnamed youth?

29:29.385 --> 29:32.843
He's an orphan whose parents
were killed

29:32.922 --> 29:35.254
in a bullet train accident in Sweden.

29:35.325 --> 29:38.089
- Could he have taken my journal?
- Oh, no. I don't think so. No.

29:38.161 --> 29:39.992
Why would he take your journal, Tripp?

29:40.063 --> 29:43.760
Perhaps he thought it was filled with
arcane secrets and treasure maps.

29:43.833 --> 29:47.064
It's that kind of object.
Does he speak English?

29:47.170 --> 29:49.866
No. Just Swedish.

29:55.378 --> 29:58.074
I was on the
nobel peace prize committee in 1990.

29:58.148 --> 30:00.173
It was a fascinating experience.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.483
Is he deaf?

30:05.588 --> 30:08.557
Was he in the train with his parents
when it crashed?

30:10.360 --> 30:15.320
Look, I took it! Okay? I took...
I took the journal. I took it. I'm sorry.

30:17.200 --> 30:21.261
- I took it. I'm sorry.
- Why would you take my journal?

30:22.472 --> 30:25.441
I took it because I wanted to
figure out...

30:26.276 --> 30:27.243
What?

30:30.013 --> 30:31.776
Who killed my dad.

30:35.084 --> 30:39.316
And you... you thought it might be me?
Is that why you stole my journal?

30:39.389 --> 30:41.448
Well, I thought that...

30:43.193 --> 30:47.061
What possible reason could I have had
to do such a thing?

30:47.130 --> 30:50.497
He was my best friend.
I don't understand.

30:59.742 --> 31:00.970
You all right?

31:01.044 --> 31:05.708
Don't even pretend to be concerned,
Tripp. Just say what you came to say.

31:06.549 --> 31:08.517
- I'm astounded.
- By what?

31:10.987 --> 31:13.421
That someone could be so mistaken.

31:14.524 --> 31:18.153
I know. I'm sorry.

31:19.329 --> 31:25.029
It's not your fault.
I mean, it's not even Nick's, really.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.003
I'm sure

31:28.605 --> 31:32.371
blaming someone must be
an attractive notion in the face of such

31:32.475 --> 31:35.035
hideous randomness,

31:35.144 --> 31:38.307
even when it's so
obviously groundless.

31:39.782 --> 31:43.047
- I'm sure.
- But still,

31:44.153 --> 31:47.122
it's such an extravagant accusation
to make.

31:48.057 --> 31:49.615
To think even.

31:50.393 --> 31:51.360
Yes.

31:53.930 --> 31:55.090
Please.

31:57.233 --> 32:00.066
I know that you miss Dutch
as much as I do.

32:01.371 --> 32:05.933
And I know this is
a terrifically hard time.

32:08.511 --> 32:09.671
But we'll

32:10.546 --> 32:12.275
get through it.

32:12.982 --> 32:15.075
We'll get through it together.

32:15.151 --> 32:19.713
You and me and Nick.

32:41.477 --> 32:43.809
Thank you for coming to find me.

32:46.883 --> 32:48.373
I have to rest.

33:00.024 --> 33:01.252
Brian,
would you just wait a minute?

33:01.326 --> 33:02.657
What are you gonna do? Hit me?

33:02.727 --> 33:06.254
- Hey, look. I just want to talk.
- I didn't kill your dad.

33:06.764 --> 33:08.425
Look. Brian, it's just...

33:09.701 --> 33:11.669
Look, Brian, just listen to me
for a second.

33:11.736 --> 33:14.603
Every minute that I spend working
with this family is another minute

33:14.672 --> 33:16.435
that I find out I didn't know
my father at all.

33:16.541 --> 33:18.475
- That's not my fault.
- And that's not the point.

33:18.543 --> 33:20.568
Don't do that to your son.

33:21.212 --> 33:22.702
Let him get to know you
while there's still time.

33:22.780 --> 33:24.907
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

33:25.683 --> 33:28.117
Go home, tell the truth, figure it out.

33:28.186 --> 33:30.154
For the sake of your only son.

33:32.357 --> 33:34.052
- Don't do that again.
- What?

33:34.125 --> 33:36.457
That "only son" thing, it's stupid.

33:41.399 --> 33:43.924
Could you check and see if I have
some mail, please?

33:44.002 --> 33:45.299
- Juliet Darling.
- No problem.

33:45.370 --> 33:47.736
Thank you. Jeremy?

33:49.640 --> 33:50.664
Hey!

33:50.742 --> 33:52.676
- What are you doing here?
- I was just going to surprise you.

33:52.744 --> 33:55.907
- You didn't tell me you were coming.
- That's crazy.

33:56.114 --> 33:57.411
Uh...

33:57.482 --> 34:00.849
- Surprise.
- Hi. Silly.

34:01.219 --> 34:04.518
- How was the photo shoot?
- It was... it was... it was a trip.

34:04.589 --> 34:05.715
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

34:05.790 --> 34:08.054
- Did everybody miss me?
- We did.

34:08.126 --> 34:10.594
But you know, it was kind of like
you were there. Like, we...

34:10.661 --> 34:12.219
We did. We felt your presence.

34:12.330 --> 34:14.161
Oh. Good.

34:15.500 --> 34:16.967
- Guess what?
- What?

34:17.034 --> 34:19.799
The guest in the penthouse
isn't a Belgian chef,

34:19.871 --> 34:23.398
is Natalie Kimpton.
And she's been staying there all month.

34:23.474 --> 34:24.735
Natalie...

34:26.377 --> 34:28.469
- Why'd you lie to me?
- I didn't want to bum you out.

34:28.545 --> 34:31.310
Don't lie to me, Jeremy.
Especially about Natalie Kimpton.

34:31.416 --> 34:33.850
She was my best friend
in the whole world. And then...

34:33.918 --> 34:36.250
She put out your signature perfume
without your name on it?

34:36.320 --> 34:37.810
- Yeah. And...
- She stole your bangs.

34:37.889 --> 34:42.018
- Like, yeah. And I hate her guts.
- That's completely understandable.

34:43.161 --> 34:44.628
- Thank you.
- Hang on a second.

34:45.496 --> 34:46.860
Jeremy Darling. Go.

34:46.964 --> 34:48.295
I just took a shower.

34:48.366 --> 34:52.632
I'm hot and I'm very, very, very wet.

34:53.438 --> 34:55.201
I'm... I'm gonna...

34:55.306 --> 34:56.398
I'm gonna have to get
back to you on that.

34:56.474 --> 34:57.771
What is that supposed to mean?

34:57.842 --> 35:01.141
You know, just work on the second
verse and then give me a call when...

35:01.212 --> 35:04.579
When it's gold, okay? Bye.

35:07.752 --> 35:09.879
- Who was that?
- That was Justin.

35:09.954 --> 35:11.649
- Timberlake?
- Yeah. He...

35:11.722 --> 35:15.180
You know, sometimes he can't,
like, see the forest for the trees.

35:15.259 --> 35:18.558
And so I help him.
Like, he gets all eggy.

35:18.629 --> 35:20.256
Do you promise not to lie to me
ever again?

35:20.331 --> 35:22.424
- You got it, sis. Yeah.
- Promise?

35:22.500 --> 35:24.559
Yeah. I don't know what...

35:24.635 --> 35:26.728
- Got into you.
... got into me. Yeah.

35:27.405 --> 35:28.463
Okay, here's the deal.

35:28.539 --> 35:32.600
We're gonna tell my wife and kids
the truth, but not until it's time, okay?

35:32.677 --> 35:35.510
- Okay.
- So, until then, just...

35:36.714 --> 35:39.478
- Act Swedish, okay?
- Okay.

35:39.550 --> 35:40.812
And...

35:43.054 --> 35:45.614
You know, I'm really, really sorry.
This is hard.

35:45.723 --> 35:48.624
You know, if this was up to me,
you wouldn't even be here.

35:48.693 --> 35:51.253
But... no, I mean,
you know, that came out wrong,

35:51.362 --> 35:53.387
but you know, what I mean is...

35:54.332 --> 35:57.790
Just...
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

35:57.869 --> 35:59.598
- Okay?
- Okay.

36:01.139 --> 36:03.107
Hey. What's your name?

36:03.474 --> 36:06.238
- Swedish name?
- Gustav.

36:06.711 --> 36:10.010
Good boy. All right, now you go up
there and you go straight to bed, okay?

36:10.081 --> 36:11.514
Okay, daddy.

36:21.192 --> 36:22.750
What is the matter?

36:22.860 --> 36:27.126
I can't concentrate
or stop concentrating.

36:28.933 --> 36:30.491
I don't know.

36:31.435 --> 36:32.959
I'm sorry.

36:35.039 --> 36:37.735
- What do you want to do, pat?
- About what?

36:38.075 --> 36:41.044
Your dad wants you to run,
your mother doesn't.

36:41.445 --> 36:44.812
- What do you want to do?
- I'm not sure.

36:46.884 --> 36:49.318
If I say something,
don't get mad, okay?

36:51.022 --> 36:52.080
Okay.

36:53.057 --> 36:55.423
I think that you should run.

36:55.526 --> 36:58.757
You should embrace
what he wants for you, and win.

36:58.829 --> 37:02.356
Go even further than little Tripp Darling
ever dreamed of.

37:04.068 --> 37:06.036
I like the sound of that.

37:06.337 --> 37:09.829
And doing what he wants today
is the only way

37:09.907 --> 37:13.206
that you might be able to do
what you want tomorrow.

37:27.291 --> 37:29.191
- Hello?
- Hi, Nick.

37:29.260 --> 37:31.091
Hey, Karen, what's up?

37:31.629 --> 37:33.563
I just wanted you to know

37:34.465 --> 37:38.333
- I'll always love you, too.
- Hey, Karen, listen, I...

37:38.402 --> 37:39.562
- Karen?
- I know.

37:39.637 --> 37:42.697
I shouldn't have said it, I'm sorry.

37:44.275 --> 37:46.436
Okay, good night.

37:48.079 --> 37:49.341
Karen?

38:04.957 --> 38:08.256
- What the hell are these?
- Virtual-reality goggles.

38:09.695 --> 38:11.526
- You really didn't have to do this.
- Oh, sure I did.

38:11.597 --> 38:15.124
I mean, you're trapped in
here all day with your momster.

38:15.201 --> 38:17.533
You sounded so down when you called.

38:18.704 --> 38:19.671
Thanks.

38:20.773 --> 38:22.502
So, what do you...

38:22.575 --> 38:25.874
- What do you do with them? I mean...
- Well, you put them on.

38:27.013 --> 38:30.278
- Okay.
- And I have to plug them in,

38:30.349 --> 38:33.375
but when the time is right,
you look where you want to go,

38:33.886 --> 38:35.581
and then you blink.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.156
Like...

38:38.257 --> 38:39.224
This?

38:43.629 --> 38:45.290
So, I got three games.

38:45.364 --> 38:50.825
I got clown fight, cosmic pirates,
and last tango in Tanya.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.599
- You wanna do it?
- Cosmic pirates?

38:55.942 --> 38:58.502
No! Last tango in Tanya.

39:04.383 --> 39:05.873
No, no, I gotta... I gotta go.

39:05.952 --> 39:08.682
I just wanted to give you
your goodbye present.

39:08.754 --> 39:10.051
Jeremy.

39:16.863 --> 39:18.228
I want you.

39:20.533 --> 39:22.364
If Juliet found out...

39:22.435 --> 39:24.164
She won't find out.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.370
Promise.

39:33.412 --> 39:34.379
Okay.

39:41.053 --> 39:42.213
Social security, national security.

39:42.288 --> 39:43.312
Sorry I'm late,

39:43.389 --> 39:44.686
- again.
- No one issue is

39:44.757 --> 39:45.917
- singularly more important...
- It's okay.

39:46.025 --> 39:47.549
...than that of education.

39:47.627 --> 39:51.154
Every young American child has
the right to a great education.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.399
To not only fulfill the dreams of their
parents, but most importantly,

39:54.500 --> 39:55.797
their own dreams.

39:55.868 --> 39:58.632
So it is with great pride and respect

39:58.804 --> 40:01.432
that I announce my candidacy
for the United States senate,

40:01.507 --> 40:04.738
representing the great state,
the empire state...

40:05.645 --> 40:08.011
- Congratulations.
... New York state.

40:10.249 --> 40:13.275
Thank you. It's what he wants.

40:15.521 --> 40:17.682
I wasn't sure you'd show up.

40:18.991 --> 40:20.356
Yeah, well...

40:23.129 --> 40:25.461
Wasn't sure I wanted you to.

40:25.531 --> 40:26.998
I understand.

40:28.734 --> 40:30.065
Thank you.

40:35.641 --> 40:39.133
I don't have any secrets, Nick.
Not there.

40:41.414 --> 40:42.972
Not anywhere.

40:44.450 --> 40:46.418
You brought his briefcase?

40:46.519 --> 40:50.751
Yeah. I did. I still haven't been able to
figure out the combination.

40:53.793 --> 40:55.954
Why don't you try 712.

41:02.235 --> 41:03.600
What's that?

41:04.904 --> 41:06.462
Tish's birthday.

41:11.911 --> 41:13.435
Give it a shot.

41:50.549 --> 41:53.017
So you knew about the affair?

41:53.519 --> 41:54.884
Of course.

42:06.966 --> 42:08.297
Simon elder.

42:09.068 --> 42:12.435
The billionaire. There's all this
information in here on Simon elder.

42:12.538 --> 42:14.233
Information about what?

42:14.907 --> 42:20.846
Immigration papers, patent records,
criminal files...

42:22.615 --> 42:26.676
Well, if I were trying to figure out

42:27.361 --> 42:32.194
who had killed my father,
that's the guy I'd start with.
