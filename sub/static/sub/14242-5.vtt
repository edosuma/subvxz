ELLIS HARTLEY MONROE:
I think someone's got to say it.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.559
We are surrounded
by people who should have died,

00:27.680 --> 00:30.239
and by persisting,
they are draining the resources

00:30.360 --> 00:32.959
of healthy, living citizens.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.159
- They're calling them Overflow Camps.
- But what the hell are they up to?

00:36.280 --> 00:37.559
Whatever it is, I bet it ain't good.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.519
And I can understand your pain,
all of you. I understand it

00:40.640 --> 00:43.399
because I have suffered the same as you.

00:43.520 --> 00:48.759
Is Oswald Danes now becoming the one
true representative of this miracle age?

00:48.880 --> 00:51.159
They're building these sort of camps
to help people.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.279
- Overflow Camps?
- Aye, that's it.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.239
And I got your dad
inside the South Wales site.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.959
Just... Just get him back!

(SIREN WAILS)

01:02.080 --> 01:04.639
Gwen...it's too late.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.199
Excuse me. I'm on the medical panels.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.719
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, you didn't get the e-mail?

01:26.840 --> 01:27.759
Sorry, those are done.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.759
Those are done?
How... How are they done?

01:29.880 --> 01:31.279
The report was sent to Congress today.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.599
The HHS secretary took it
directly to the President.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.559
Now the categories have been finalised,

01:35.680 --> 01:37.639
it clears the way
for a lot of legislation.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.479
- Categories? What categories?
- The categories of life.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.719
- What does that mean?
- Instead of dead or alive,

01:43.840 --> 01:46.479
there are now three categories. Here.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.119
It's being rolled out
across America and Europe.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.599
The categories become official
at midnight.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.479
(PHONE RINGS)

02:02.000 --> 02:04.839
DrJuarez, I was right.
I knew you'd call me back.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.919
Oh, I'm doing a lot more than that!
I'm joining the cause.

02:07.040 --> 02:10.439
Whatever you're doing
to fight this miracle, count me in.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.359
They just took control
of life and death.

02:31.600 --> 02:35.159
And today, United Nations has officially
sanctioned the new category system

02:35.280 --> 02:36.359
with immediate effect,

02:36.480 --> 02:39.319
calling this a radical new start
for the health of humanity.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.519
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

02:42.640 --> 02:46.519
The President said today
that categorisation was compulsory.

(SPEAKS JAPANESE)

02:52.000 --> 02:53.439
Under the emergency miracle law,

02:53.560 --> 02:56.639
anyone designated
as Category 1 or Category 2

02:56.760 --> 02:59.239
must be taken to the new
Overflow Camps.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.559
The scheme is already under way
in the United Kingdom,

03:01.680 --> 03:06.119
with the Prime Minister declaring this
a new age of care and compassion.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.279
Thank you.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.839
Yvonne Pallister.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.639
Yes, indeed, madam.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.479
I'm your driver...clearly.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.359
Might I ask,
is there any luggage to pick up?

03:55.480 --> 03:57.919
No, the only thing
you'll be picking up is me.

03:58.040 --> 03:58.999
Well, that'll be a pleasure.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.559
I don't think I like
the tone of your voice.

04:00.680 --> 04:03.119
- And what are you going to do about it?
- Many things.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.519
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

04:08.640 --> 04:11.159
(LAUGHS) Come on, let's get out of here.
Who's with Anwen?

04:11.280 --> 04:13.719
No-one. I left her with petrol
and a cigarette lighter.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.959
- Oh!
- Your mum's there, isn't she?

04:16.080 --> 04:20.479
Oh, great(!) See, now in America,
you can legally divorce your own mother.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.679
That's it, I get it. They do things
better in America, don't they?

04:23.800 --> 04:25.719
Not everything, Mr Sloane.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.919
Well, hello there. Look at you.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.839
(LAUGHS) Look at you!

04:34.960 --> 04:37.799
Have you been good?
Have you missed your mum?

04:37.920 --> 04:41.999
Oh, look at how you've grown so much.
Now, have I got a kiss?

04:42.120 --> 04:44.919
She's a very good girl.
Sleeps the whole night.

04:45.040 --> 04:47.359
Doesn't fuss at bedtime
like some babies I could mention.

04:47.480 --> 04:50.159
Look what you're wearing, huh?

04:50.280 --> 04:52.919
So much pink.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.319
Huh? So cute.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.199
- What's all this?
- Your latest mission.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.439
Oh, for God's sake, Mary,
I told you, let her get in!

04:59.560 --> 05:01.599
Let her sit down and spend some time
with her own daughter.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.879
She doesn't need to start work
straightaway, isn't that right, Gwen?

05:05.800 --> 05:08.839
- And this is all off the A48?
- Two miles outside Cowbridge.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.439
Taking in patients
from the whole of South Wales.

05:11.560 --> 05:14.999
- It looks like old army barracks.
- Closed down in 1 996, reopened

05:15.120 --> 05:18.359
two days ago.
Designated an official Overflow Camp.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.639
That's where they've taken your father.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.799
And that's where you're going...

05:23.920 --> 05:25.679
to get him out.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.279
If you're here about an existing claim,

05:32.400 --> 05:34.479
step to the right, please.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.959
But my son is in there.
They took him and no-one asked me.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.479
Can I see him, please? He's only 1 7.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.519
I've written, I've phoned. I've been
standing over there for two hours

05:40.640 --> 05:42.239
- and I was in the wrong place.
- MAN: I've got money,

05:42.360 --> 05:44.599
- 5,000 in cash...
- No, no. Can I remind you all,

05:44.720 --> 05:50.359
any cars parked by the gates
of the module will be towed? No excuses.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.519
Bloody hellfire.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.919
What's the size of this place?

05:53.040 --> 05:55.719
God knows. They've got patients
coming in from Bristol too.

05:55.840 --> 05:59.319
Hospitals are closing across
the Southwest, cos MRSA is going crazy.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.999
Add to that the increase
in geriatrics and maternity,

06:02.120 --> 06:03.679
the NHS is going to go bust
by the end of the week.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.839
How many camps nationwide?

06:04.960 --> 06:08.079
35 so far. I mean, fair do's,
it might be chaos, but at least it works.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.879
Andy, don't be so thick!

06:10.000 --> 06:12.559
- Well, it's nice to have you back(!)
- Well, think about it!

06:12.680 --> 06:14.959
No NHS - who's paying for all this?
PhiCorp.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.519
You've got healthcare
being run by private business.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.559
And, believe me,
just the start of your problems.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.639
Now, listen, one at a time.

06:21.760 --> 06:24.719
- He's Category 2.
- I'm first, my mother's Category 1 .

06:24.840 --> 06:27.159
- I need to take my father home.
- You need to get...

06:27.280 --> 06:28.879
You need to back off.
His name is Geraint Wyn Cooper.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.959
- No-one's going out today.
- Right, forget you.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.199
Who's in charge?
(SHOUTS) Who's in charge?!

06:33.320 --> 06:36.599
Admin is over there.
Complaint forms are on the desk in yellow.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.439
- Right.
- But we've been waiting over there.

06:38.560 --> 06:39.879
- (CROWD SHOUTS)
- Everyone...

06:47.000 --> 06:50.839
Excuse me. Excuse me, Lieutenant.
This won't take long.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.679
I need to remove a patient.
It's urgent.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.759
Then you really need to speak

06:53.880 --> 06:55.559
to one of the care workers over there.
They can tell you

06:55.680 --> 06:57.079
- how to process your claim.
- It's not a claim.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.559
I haven't bumped my car.
We're talking about my father.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.439
Sorry, if I could just, er...

07:01.560 --> 07:03.879
The thing is,
the removal of this woman's father

07:04.000 --> 07:06.719
is being done under police authority...

07:06.840 --> 07:08.199
- sir.
- Thank you,

07:08.320 --> 07:10.959
but we are not under the control
of the Welsh police, Sergeant.

07:11.080 --> 07:15.199
Look, his name is Geraint Wyn Cooper.
He's had a heart attack,

07:15.320 --> 07:17.679
- but he's recovering.
- So he sounds like a Category 2,

07:17.800 --> 07:19.239
which means he'll be perfectly safe
in here.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.079
If you'd care to read the definitions...

07:21.200 --> 07:24.199
GWYN: Oh, I like that!
Yeah, I'll show you definitions.

07:24.320 --> 07:25.599
Just have a look at this.

07:25.720 --> 07:26.999
Bloody PhiCorp logo.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.759
Now, listen to me.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.519
This country is not under martial law.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.079
My father is a taxpayer
and a law-abiding citizen,

07:33.200 --> 07:34.599
and he is entitled to go home,

07:34.720 --> 07:38.399
and I am not moving until I take him.
Have you got that?!

07:38.520 --> 07:40.919
Yes, that's perfectly clear.
And I hope it's also clear

07:41.040 --> 07:42.519
why I'm now having you arrested.

07:42.640 --> 07:44.479
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, sorry, boys.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.399
- Come on, Gwen, I think we're leaving.
- I'm not going anywhere.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.919
Given time, we will have this facility
open and happy

07:49.040 --> 07:52.079
and running like clockwork
with access for all. But right now,

07:52.200 --> 07:55.239
we have cholera and dysentery
and swine flu,

07:55.360 --> 07:57.519
and every single patient needs
immediate definition

07:57.640 --> 07:59.519
under the three categories.
So it's a lockdown.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.999
No-one is allowed in
and no-one is allowed out.

08:02.120 --> 08:06.839
When the situation changes,
we'll let you know. Thank you.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.479
Excuse me, please. Excuse me.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.479
Bloody categories.
All the things I fought with Torchwood,

08:15.600 --> 08:16.879
and what stops me? Red tape.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.399
- We'll find another way, Gwen.
- Yes, and I'll tell you what it is.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.239
We're going to break in here,
find my father,

08:21.360 --> 08:22.999
and we're going to get him out...
tonight.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.079
Do you think I'm useless?

08:35.200 --> 08:38.279
No. I think you're new to all this.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.479
- Yeah, but I'm CIA.
- So is Rex.

08:41.640 --> 08:42.999
But he's just pretending.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.319
And that's the big secret, Esther.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.719
At times like these,

08:47.840 --> 08:50.679
the game goes to the person
who speaks with the loudest voice.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.919
But pretty much everyone just wishes
their mother was here.

08:54.960 --> 09:00.599
I lost my mom back in 2003.
What about you?

09:00.720 --> 09:02.039
I don't know.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.399
Long ago and so far away.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.239
Jack...

09:11.560 --> 09:12.559
Where are you from?

09:12.680 --> 09:15.759
(PHONES RING)

09:17.680 --> 09:18.719
Rex.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.479
Rex. Hmm. The loudest voice.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.999
That's him.

09:25.160 --> 09:28.039
Got to go.
World to save, useless Esther.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.959
Vera, this is Jack Harkness.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.439
We keep meeting. It's like destiny.

09:35.560 --> 09:38.799
Yeah, he likes to call himself
Captain Jack, but I'm not buying that.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.599
And Esther you've already met,
when I got injured.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.119
DrJuarez, hello again.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.799
You can call me Vera.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.519
I was lucky to get a flight.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.119
Everyone's coming to LA for this event
tonight - the Miracle Rally?

09:49.240 --> 09:51.239
The plane was full, and the AC was bust.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.719
I could use a shower.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.599
We're a bit short of room.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.559
- That's OK.
- But I suppose you two...

09:58.680 --> 10:01.999
I mean, you're going to share...
Or is that none of my business?

10:02.120 --> 10:04.679
I mean...you're both....

10:04.800 --> 10:05.919
Didn't you?

10:06.040 --> 10:07.839
I'll sleep on the floor.

10:09.160 --> 10:10.799
Yeah, thanks for nothing, man.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.839
Sorry, my mistake.
Or are you not buying that too?

10:23.760 --> 10:25.959
Let me make one thing clear.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.039
I didn't travel across the country
for you. I came here to work.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.199
My patients are being held
behind a barbed-wire fence,

10:31.320 --> 10:33.439
which means
I need to get this miracle resolved.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.359
And that's all I need from you.
Understood?

10:36.520 --> 10:37.519
This is my room.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.919
I know.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.719
And Torchwood is...go!

10:51.760 --> 10:54.679
This is everything we've gathered so far,
and we've got chases updating

10:54.800 --> 10:57.639
every 20 seconds,
tapping into major news feeds,

10:57.760 --> 11:01.799
WikiLeaks, back-door routes
into the CIA and FBI.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.719
What about South Wales?

11:04.840 --> 11:06.439
Yeah, I'm here. Can you see me?

11:06.560 --> 11:07.759
Clear as daylight, Agent Cooper.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.879
Have you seen the latest?
France and Germany,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.559
they've all started Overflow Camps.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.959
The whole of Europe is joining in.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.199
China's saying no to the camps,
and the Pan-African Summit said yes.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.079
You're researching morphic fields?

11:19.200 --> 11:20.599
Yeah, that's Jack's favourite subject.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.519
It kept getting mentioned
on the medical panels.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.279
But it's only theory.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.919
That's Jilly Kitzinger!
Are you following her?

11:29.040 --> 11:32.119
No, we're following Oswald Danes,
but she never leaves his side.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.879
He's connected to the top,
even if he doesn't know it yet.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.039
So this name, Torchwood...

11:38.160 --> 11:41.359
you're like...investigators?

11:41.480 --> 11:43.639
More like freedom fighters.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.719
That makes you sound like terrorists.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.279
Look, Torchwood's gone, OK?
It's just a name these days.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.959
Just kind of works as a...a codeword

11:51.080 --> 11:53.279
- to connect us, that's all.
- Hmm.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.359
So am I Torchwood now?

11:55.480 --> 11:56.919
Welcome aboard.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.999
Not sure if that's good or bad.

12:00.960 --> 12:05.479
OK, let's figure out
how these categories work.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.119
- Esther.
- Uh, yeah.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.439
Uh...

12:13.320 --> 12:15.639
Well, they've activated the categories
over here.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.399
It's officialdom gone mad. So, listen,

12:17.520 --> 12:20.679
um...Category 1 is bad, yes?

12:20.800 --> 12:22.719
Yeah, that's people
with no brain function,

12:22.840 --> 12:25.679
or anyone who would normally have died.
They're now officially Category 1 .

12:25.800 --> 12:27.199
Ordinary people are Category 3.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.199
Right. That's people with no injuries,
nothing. They're fine.

12:30.320 --> 12:32.559
Then Category 2
is everyone in-between -

12:32.680 --> 12:35.359
people who are alive and functioning
with an illness or injury

12:35.480 --> 12:36.959
that's gonna persist but not kill.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.159
Like me.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.839
Yes, like you.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.679
Wait a minute, when I got hurt,
I should have died.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.439
I was Category 1 .

12:44.560 --> 12:46.279
But now I'm healing, so I'm Category 2.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.239
- So which one am I?
- Well, that's the point.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.879
People don't fit categories.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.359
Worse than that, this process
has given the United Nations

12:53.480 --> 12:56.679
a definition for life, which is therefore
a definition of death.

12:56.800 --> 13:00.719
The Government now has the power
to decide whether you're dead or alive.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.479
No-one should have that much control.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.199
Yeah, but I still don't see it, though.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.119
I mean, what does PhiCorp get
out of this? How do they profit?

13:07.240 --> 13:10.599
- You think they causedthe miracle?
- Well, they had advance knowledge,

13:10.720 --> 13:13.359
but they just deal in pharmaceuticals.
It's gotta be bigger than that.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.519
So you're looking for
someone behind PhiCorp?

13:16.640 --> 13:18.639
- Right.
- And whoever that is,

13:18.760 --> 13:21.199
maybe they need
these Overflow Camps for a reason,

13:21.320 --> 13:25.639
cos I have been looking into the
NORAD satellites and the building specs.

13:25.760 --> 13:29.799
Um, sorry,
I've been overlaying documents. Um...

13:29.920 --> 13:34.239
Look, this is our nearest
Overflow Camp in San Pedro.

13:34.360 --> 13:38.399
These...are the specs that we got
from the PhiCorp server.

13:39.480 --> 13:42.959
Spot the difference? Look at the building
on the plans called the module.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.599
But where is it on the photograph?

13:44.720 --> 13:46.439
No module.

13:46.560 --> 13:50.719
There's a module on the plans
but not on the photos. It doesn't exist.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.119
No, hang on. I heard somebody
refer to the module today.

13:53.240 --> 13:56.119
Exactly, and that's what
I've been wanting to show you.

13:56.240 --> 13:59.199
The module's been masked. That's what
they do with military installations.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.039
Right, so I went into NORAD

14:02.160 --> 14:05.039
and I got the undoctored photographs.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.479
The buildings exist. Half of these are
old army camps just being converted.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.119
And now anything labelled "the module"
is hidden from view

14:13.240 --> 14:14.639
so the public can't see what's going on.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.359
It's the same for all the sites
I've checked.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.799
Same thing in Wales too, Gwen.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.079
- Mm-hm.
- So they've taken buildings

14:21.200 --> 14:24.999
and sealed them off out of sight?
What for?

14:25.120 --> 14:26.879
Well, they're gathering
all the Category 1 s.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.599
The only question is,
what are they using the bodies for?

14:29.720 --> 14:32.799
Is it to investigate or to experiment?

14:32.920 --> 14:36.119
Do you mean like dissections?
They're dissecting people?

14:36.240 --> 14:38.559
Vivisections.
When they're alive, it's vivisections.

14:38.680 --> 14:40.239
My father's in there.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.999
They could be cultivating -
making diseases to make more customers

14:44.120 --> 14:46.559
using Category 1 patients
like Petri dishes.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.079
It could explain the rush
to strip away their human rights.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.839
So we need to get inside the camp
to find out what those modules are.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.639
Yeah, already on it this end.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.279
Rhys has signed up as a driver,
and I used the ID software

14:56.400 --> 14:58.199
to get on the medical register.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.959
So, er, Nurse Yvonne Pallister
is going on the night shift.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.839
- (LAUGHTER)
- San Pedro needs clerical staff.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.519
If I can get inside the office, there's
bound to be paperwork on the module.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.159
I could get inside.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.399
What?

15:11.520 --> 15:13.519
If I use my position
on the medical panels,

15:13.640 --> 15:15.679
I could go to San Pedro as an inspector.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.399
Vera, this isn't a game, OK?

15:17.520 --> 15:20.759
Infiltration is specialised work,
and this time, I'm pulling rank.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.279
I'm the only one that can get
to the heart of this Category 1 thing,

15:24.400 --> 15:27.479

His name's Rex.

15:35.640 --> 15:39.239
He was injured after Miracle Day.
We thought he'd be fine, but he collapsed.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.879
It's OK, Rex. We've got you.
So what happened?

to the Overflow Facility in San Pedro.

- Is that OK?
- Can I come with him?

16:09.800 --> 16:10.719
He's on his way.

16:10.840 --> 16:14.039
Right, I'm going to follow. I phoned
Washington and pulled a few strings.

- No, no, no.

- Any trouble, I can help get her out.
- OK,

- I could be your...assistant.
- We told you

16:32.960 --> 16:36.839
not a chance. That assassin said
that you're too connected. And besides,

23:39.600 --> 23:40.999
- Yeah.
- Your friend Vera

23:41.120 --> 23:44.199
- is keeping the boss distracted.
- What? I told her to stay out of this!

23:44.320 --> 23:46.159
Yeah, well, guess what, Rex?
Not everyone listens to you.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.359
All right, now quickly,

23:48.480 --> 23:50.879
this makes you dead.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.119
- All right.
- I hate this.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.359
Don't go getting sentimental on me.
Did you bring the camera?

23:56.480 --> 24:01.959
All right, great. Now you need
to categorise me. Get me that red peg.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.959
Go ahead, it's right there. Red peg.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.319
Put it right there.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.479
All right, here. Here.

24:09.600 --> 24:13.599
Here, keep that in case
you need to change categories.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.999
Category 1 , there's no coming back.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.519
Don't say that.
You're going to be fine.

24:17.640 --> 24:20.719
Just find out what's inside the module.
See you outside.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.119
All right.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.919
Excuse me.

24:28.040 --> 24:30.559
Hello. Hi. Excuse me.
This man's in the wrong place.

24:30.680 --> 24:33.399
His chart says that he's Category 1 .
I double-checked with the office.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.239
He's not supposed to be here,
so we need to get him moved.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.639
Take him to the module, OK?

24:42.280 --> 24:44.559
OK, I found you this.

24:44.680 --> 24:46.159
Huh?

24:48.360 --> 24:50.439
And here's a new copy of the speech.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.239
They've added some stuff in about
a lifetime of penitence, et cetera.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.759
I understood that I was supposed
to have a dressing room.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.239
- Did they run out?
- Oh, no.

25:00.360 --> 25:01.799
No, there's plenty of dressing rooms.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.999
Actually, I just checked.
You'd be surprised - genuinely chic.

25:05.120 --> 25:07.359
I'd imagined
this place to be all concrete.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.279
Where's mine?

25:10.400 --> 25:12.319
Mm, tiny little problem.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.279
Certain other people
in certain other dressing rooms,

25:15.400 --> 25:16.959
they don't want you anywhere near them.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.199
And we're talking
serious names here.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.559
It's a very definite
ixnay on the Oswaldway.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.519
But that's yourjob.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.439
You represent me.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.039
You get me a room!

25:27.160 --> 25:30.159
Now, don't get angry.
Careful with the bloodlust. It's showing.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.079
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- Excuse me...?

25:32.200 --> 25:34.479
Steve, no. I told him no.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.879
And you know what?
If that little bastard tries to charge me

25:37.000 --> 25:39.999
one more time, so help me God,
I'm going to get Ioannidis on him.

25:51.960 --> 25:55.679
Won't be but a minute.
No, no, stay here. That's an order.

26:43.480 --> 26:45.159
MAN: Take him to the module.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.919
(HORN PLAYS "I Wish I Was In Dixie")

26:58.040 --> 27:01.399
I want you to meet Ralph. He's my
personal escort while I'm on the lot.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.599
- Great guy. Great guy.
- Good to meet you, Doctor.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.599
You too, Ralph.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.919
This is my first tour,

27:07.040 --> 27:09.999
but I think we might get some important
people wanting to visit, you know?

27:10.120 --> 27:11.559
- Mm-hm?
- We've got a line on Hilary

27:11.680 --> 27:13.399
I'm feeling really good about.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.119
Hillary Clinton?

27:15.240 --> 27:16.239
Duff.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.399
Hilary Duff.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.199
All right, this way.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.279
Pearls before swine.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.519
TV: ...to help their system and to fund
research into the miracle itself.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.799
Oh, we're missing it -
that Miracle Rally.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.799
I hear rumours of Phil Collins.

27:39.840 --> 27:42.879
This patient is being monitored
every hour. That's very good.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.279
Yes, our priority is efficiency.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.399
If a patient is in decline,
we monitor them very closely

27:48.520 --> 27:50.399
so that we can move them
to Category 1 promptly

27:50.520 --> 27:52.239
without wasting any more resources.

27:52.360 --> 27:55.119
Your priority is not efficiency.
Your priority is care.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.839
Everybody gets sufficient care,
Miss Juarez. Did I say any different?

27:58.960 --> 28:00.759
Category 1 is the same as dead.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.919
You're not just downgrading
someone's status if you move them

28:03.040 --> 28:04.719
from Cat 2 to Cat 1 .
You're letting them die.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.239
Well, there are new triage regulations,
Doctor.

28:08.360 --> 28:11.479
- Treat the ones that can recover.
- Yes, and I started those...

28:11.600 --> 28:13.959
- for emergency situations only.
- This is an emergency.

28:14.080 --> 28:17.679
Everything here is an emergency.
We can't give everybody private rooms.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.279
Would you like a private room...

28:19.400 --> 28:20.959
George?

28:21.080 --> 28:24.639
Yeah? See, they'd all love private rooms.
But it's impossible.

28:24.760 --> 28:27.679
Now, you should see the kitchens.
They are gleaming.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.639
Gwen?

29:01.640 --> 29:03.039
(GASPS) Oh, my God, Dad.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.399
I thought that was you.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.319
How are you? How do you feel?

29:06.440 --> 29:09.319
- All the better for seeing you.
- Oh, Dad!

29:11.280 --> 29:15.799
- What are you wearing? Pyjamas?
- No, Dad. (LAUGHS)

29:15.920 --> 29:18.679
You look good, though.
(WHISPERS) It's good to see you.

29:18.800 --> 29:21.479
Yeah, we couldn't come and visit.
They wouldn't let us in.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.359
So that's why I've come to get you,
all right?

29:23.480 --> 29:25.479
- Get me?
- Yeah.

29:25.600 --> 29:26.719
Oh, Rhys is here.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.519
Hiya, Geraint, all right?
I've got the lorry. Ready to go.

29:29.640 --> 29:32.559
Let's go, Dad. What have you got -
shoes or...orjust slippers?

29:32.680 --> 29:34.719
- Where are we going?
- It's not safe here, Dad,

29:34.840 --> 29:36.239
OK? I'm going to take you home.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.879
What... What do you mean it's not safe?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.639
You know all those things I used
to investigate with Torchwood?

29:40.760 --> 29:44.119
This is one of them. Haven't got time
to explain now, but listen,

29:44.240 --> 29:47.799
- you've got to come with me, Dad, OK?
- Yeah. Right you are, then.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.919
OK, that's it. That's it,
as fast as we can.

29:51.040 --> 29:54.119
That's it, all right?

29:54.240 --> 29:56.759
- Almost there, Dad.
- Easiest to have him in the cab.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.479
Geraint, can you climb up?
We'll give you a hand.

29:58.600 --> 29:59.919
I can do that, don't worry.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.119
- Rhys, go around and pull him up.
- OK.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.439
Are they coming? Is it safe?

30:04.560 --> 30:07.279
Dad, don't panic now.
Stay calm. I've got you.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.039
Hurry up.
People are starting to notice.

30:12.080 --> 30:14.319
(GROANS)

30:14.440 --> 30:17.239
- He doesn't look good.
- What? Dad?

30:17.360 --> 30:19.919
- Gwen. (GROANS)
- Dad? Dad?

30:20.040 --> 30:22.519
- (GERAINT GROANS)
- Dad! We need some help, please.

30:22.640 --> 30:24.279
I need some help!
Anyone, please, I need some help!

30:24.400 --> 30:26.719
- You're a nurse, you're a nurse.
- OK, code one.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.399
Assistance needed, please!

30:28.520 --> 30:30.759
- Code one! I need assistance now!
- Come on!

30:30.880 --> 30:33.479
Look, he's my patient. He's already
had a heart attack, all right?

30:33.600 --> 30:35.839
Look, he's my dad, OK?
He's my father.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.679
Now I need you to look after him, please.
Is it bad?

30:38.800 --> 30:41.239
I got you. Dad?

30:56.240 --> 31:01.279
All right, this must be the module.
I'm inside.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.119
As you can see, they...

31:03.240 --> 31:05.679
they treat the patients like...

31:06.720 --> 31:08.599
...like objects.

31:12.760 --> 31:16.279
This wall is cold.
I was thinking it might be brick, but...

31:16.400 --> 31:18.319
ceramic maybe.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.439
These people are still alive.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.879
I'm starting to think
I'm in a refrigeration unit.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.239
A lot of these patients are injured,
so I can't tell

31:30.360 --> 31:32.199
if they've been experimented on or not.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.119
And just for the record,
this man is warm,

31:38.240 --> 31:40.679
which feels strange in this cold place.

31:43.480 --> 31:46.999
I'm going to go outside
and see what I can find in this area.

31:47.120 --> 31:49.039
God knows what PhiCorp is doing.

31:49.160 --> 31:54.639
But why the hell...would they have
all these bodies...in one place?

32:16.960 --> 32:18.599
I'm sorry, where are you going?

32:18.720 --> 32:20.679
- I want to see inside.
- It's just storage!

32:20.800 --> 32:22.519
Every time I want to see anything,
you turn me away.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.839
I'm here to inspect, so let me do my job.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.119
Storage? This is storage?!

32:31.240 --> 32:32.759
It's a temporary measure.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.599
- Oh, my God.
- We don't have the staff,

32:34.720 --> 32:36.319
we don't have the money,
we don't have the room.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.199
- But who are they?
- These are the ones without insurance.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.159
Where are the nurses?
Have they even been fed?!

32:42.360 --> 32:45.839
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
but how long have you been here?

32:45.960 --> 32:48.199
Yesterday.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.439
They said...we had to wait.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.559
These people, they're just...
They're pending.

32:52.680 --> 32:54.759
We've a couple of glitches
in the system, that's all.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.199
I'd point out that ten days ago,
I had a job in public housing.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.279
I think I've adapted very well.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.359
- (WEAKLY) Please, help me.
- Holy shit. He's wearing red!

33:01.480 --> 33:04.039
He's got a red peg.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.759
But he can't be, he's conscious.

33:05.880 --> 33:08.119
So we made a mistake.
Hundreds of patients, one mistake.

33:08.240 --> 33:09.559
That's an excellent hit rate.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.319
You made him Category 1 !

33:11.440 --> 33:12.959
He's not 1 ! He's nowhere near 1 !

33:13.080 --> 33:16.159
Do you realise what happens
when you make somebody 1 ?

33:16.280 --> 33:18.679
I think we should step outside.
We're disturbing the patients.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.599
What else are you hiding?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.279
Is this laundry?
Are they bed sheets?

33:29.400 --> 33:30.639
Oh, God, this place is stinking!

33:30.760 --> 33:33.519
I think you've forgotten
America's in crisis. Times like this,

33:33.640 --> 33:35.439
somebody's got to take charge.

33:35.560 --> 33:37.679
And in this instance, it just...
happens to be me.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.959
- You think you're doing a good job?!
- I'm under budget.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.319
You're supposed to spendthe money.

33:42.440 --> 33:45.039
Oh, for God's sake. That's why
a system like this is never gonna work -

33:45.160 --> 33:46.999
because it's always gonna be run
by men like you.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.239
Oh, so what are you gonna do,
report me(?)

33:49.360 --> 33:51.719
I'm gonna do more than that.
I'm gonna have you prosecuted.

33:51.840 --> 33:54.999
- Oh, you're so full of it!
- You're gonna be prosecuted

33:55.120 --> 33:56.399
for causing harm
to those people in your care

33:56.520 --> 33:58.759
and youwill be found
guilty as charged.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.239
I guarantee you're going to jail,
you stupidlittle man.

34:02.360 --> 34:05.799
I'm gonna see you inside a prison cell,
you limp-dick little coward.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.679
Ralph, come on. Come on, arrest me.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.559
- Oh, don't be so rid...
- This lady wants to arrest me.

34:09.680 --> 34:12.279
- You going to do that?
- Maybe you should both cool off.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.839
You should do it, DrJuarez.
You're so clever.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.439
- Come on. Come on, arrest me.
- Get your hands the hell off me!

34:18.520 --> 34:19.439
Give me the gun!

34:19.560 --> 34:22.759
- Oh, my God!
- Shut up. Both of you, shut up!

34:22.880 --> 34:27.119
You are going away for ever!
Do you hear me? You shot me!

34:27.240 --> 34:28.199
Oh, God!

34:28.320 --> 34:31.959
No way! Colin, that's enough now, OK?

34:33.720 --> 34:36.159
Get someone. (WHIMPERS)

34:36.280 --> 34:39.719
Colin, think what
you're going to say, OK?

34:39.840 --> 34:42.159
Cos someone's going to hear
those gunshots.

34:45.240 --> 34:46.879
It was a door.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.799
- It was a door.
- (SLAMS DOOR)

34:48.920 --> 34:53.039
Hear that? Hear that, everybody?
It was a door!

34:53.160 --> 34:54.919
It was only the door!

34:55.040 --> 34:59.159
It was the door! It was the door!
It was only the door!

34:59.280 --> 35:01.119
(WHIMPERS) Get some...

35:01.240 --> 35:02.959
Get me a car.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.199
Ralph, help me.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.119
Oh, man, there's blood everywhere.
We can get her help.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.239
- Colin, she's talking!
- Just lift her goddamn feet.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.959
You're an accomplice.
Just do what I say.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.559
(PANTING)

35:38.040 --> 35:40.319
- On the floor?
- She's fine.

35:40.440 --> 35:41.879
Sometimes the floor is fine.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.599
Hey, what is this place?

35:44.720 --> 35:48.959
OK...you take the car. I'll walk back.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.559
- You didn't see anything, OK?
- Colin,

35:51.680 --> 35:54.559
you've just got to stop and think.
This is murder!

35:54.680 --> 35:58.239
No, it can't be. Don't you get that?
It's a brand-new world, Ralph.

35:58.360 --> 36:02.879
A world with no more death,
which means there is no more murder.

36:04.200 --> 36:05.159
Now go.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.559
Go.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.079
Leave me my jacket.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.479
(DOOR SLAMS)

36:14.600 --> 36:19.479
Ladies and gentlemen
and children of the world,

36:19.600 --> 36:22.279
this is Los Angeles...

36:22.400 --> 36:26.839
- (CHEERING AND WHOOPING)
- ...and this is the Miracle Rally!

36:31.080 --> 36:32.839
Ah. OK.

36:34.200 --> 36:36.239
You're on in five minutes.
They've cut you down to 90 seconds.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.319
But here's the new draft.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.919
- Oh, goddamn it.
- And the keyword

36:40.040 --> 36:43.959
is still "revelation".
You got that? Hm?

36:44.080 --> 36:46.159
You've got to say "revelation".

36:46.280 --> 36:48.039
Hm?

36:48.160 --> 36:49.479
OK.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.079
MAN: Miss Kitzinger?

37:01.200 --> 37:02.319
Can I help you?

37:04.920 --> 37:08.839
Just wanted to say
you're doing a very good job.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.399
Thank you. And you are?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.719
Oh, this isn't about me.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.839
You're the one being noticed.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.279
By whom?

37:19.400 --> 37:21.359
The right people.

37:23.640 --> 37:24.879
Good.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.319
Excellent.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.159
We should talk.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.439
We'll see.

37:37.560 --> 37:40.679
(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

37:47.080 --> 37:48.639
He was fine.

37:48.760 --> 37:53.959
Then I sweep in like I'm gonna
solve everything. And then I cause this.

37:54.080 --> 37:56.399
- You didn't cause anything.
- He had another heart attack...

37:56.520 --> 37:57.559
- (PHONE BUZZES)
- ...because I made him get up, Rhys,

37:57.680 --> 37:58.599
and your phone won't stop

37:58.720 --> 38:00.319
- bloody buzzing.
- It's the supervisor.

38:00.440 --> 38:03.479
- I'm supposed to be at work, remember?
- Go! Go to work.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.359
Don't let them give you the sack -
we might still need that lorry.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.199
Go on, I'll call you
when I know something.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.599
- I promise.
- Yeah.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.039
Excuse me.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.999
Hi. Don't want to bother you,
but the man who had a heart attack,

38:24.120 --> 38:26.439
Geraint Cooper, he's my dad.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.519
Sorry, your father's being reclassified.
He's Category 1 .

38:28.640 --> 38:29.919
Um...

38:30.040 --> 38:31.959
No, no, no, I read the definitions.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.039
- Category 1 is like death.
- Well, your father is unconscious.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.599
His heart is failing.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.999
- But that's not Category 1 .
- I'm sorry. The doctor decides, not me.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.119
Right, well, where is this doctor,
because I need a word, OK?

38:41.240 --> 38:43.159
- Because my father is not dead.
- Well, you've got

38:43.280 --> 38:45.079
till tomorrow morning,
cos then we have to move him.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.959
Those are the instructions, I'm afraid.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.439
All Category 1 s go to the module.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.879
- And what happens there?
- Sorry, it's not my area.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.919
Try asking admin.

38:53.040 --> 38:57.239
Wheel him out.
Store him with the rest of the Cat 1 s.

39:00.360 --> 39:04.119
I just got a call that Maloney's golf cart
is sitting outside the west block.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.799
Is he still on that tour?

39:05.920 --> 39:07.399
I guess not.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.719
- He called for a car.
- He did?

39:09.840 --> 39:14.239
So that woman, DrJuarez,
is she still here?

39:28.280 --> 39:30.799
All right, I've searched the perimeter.

39:30.920 --> 39:32.559
This place is sealed off.

39:32.680 --> 39:35.039
There are a total of three buildings
in this module.

39:35.160 --> 39:37.839
But the capacity is small.
There's no way in hell

39:37.960 --> 39:41.719
that they'll be able to accommodate
all the Category 1 patients coming in.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.159
It's impossible.

39:44.880 --> 39:49.799
MAN ON STAGE: I remember
when I was a child, I used to dream.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.919
I had a dream...

40:01.800 --> 40:05.559
MrJack Harkness.

40:05.680 --> 40:09.199
I could accuse you
of having an obsession with me.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.519
What happens afterwards, Oswald,

40:11.640 --> 40:13.439
when the fever dies down

40:13.560 --> 40:17.599
and the world wakes up to the fact
that a murderer is standing centre stage?

40:19.040 --> 40:23.079
Somewhere out there, those men
are waiting for you in the dark.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.479
I can smell them.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.759
Their pits are soaked
with sweat and bile.

40:28.880 --> 40:29.839
But what if...

40:29.960 --> 40:32.759
you became a hero instead?

40:34.400 --> 40:37.919
Oh, my, so...
Certainly, that would be good.

40:40.200 --> 40:44.639
You're about to go out on stage
and talk to the world

40:44.760 --> 40:47.599
with a happy little PhiCorp speech, yeah?

40:49.880 --> 40:52.679
But you could use this moment,
Oswald.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.679
Here's your speech.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.159
Say those words instead.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.599
PhiCorp knew about the miracle,

41:01.720 --> 41:06.399
they've been ready for years.
That's the proof all written down

41:06.520 --> 41:08.479
ready for everyone to hear it.

41:10.000 --> 41:11.919
You want my help.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.879
I want anyone's help.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.439
I've never dealt with anything like this.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.439
It's way beyond me.

41:19.560 --> 41:24.119
But you...you could expose PhiCorp
live on air

41:24.240 --> 41:27.159
and help me change the world.

41:29.160 --> 41:31.239
We'd be partners?

41:31.360 --> 41:34.639
- Mm.
- And what would I get out of it?

41:37.200 --> 41:38.359
End the miracle...

41:41.200 --> 41:42.319
...then you can die.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.199
You're cursed with intelligence.

41:45.760 --> 41:50.319
Clever enough to know who you are
and wise enough to want it to end.

41:52.760 --> 41:56.159
You help me, and I promise...

41:56.280 --> 41:59.159
I will help youto die.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.639
JILLY: Oswald! Oswald, they've been
looking for you. You're on in 30 seconds.

42:04.760 --> 42:06.199
Yeah, sure. Certainly.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.479
Do the right thing, Oswald.

42:08.520 --> 42:09.439
I'm sorry, who are you?

42:09.560 --> 42:11.759
- You've got one chance. Take it.
- One chance for what?

42:11.880 --> 42:13.319
What exactly did you just say to him?

42:13.440 --> 42:14.959
Maybe you're about to find out.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.079
Who are you?

42:17.200 --> 42:18.559
Don't miss the speech.

42:20.440 --> 42:21.999
One more thing, soldier.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.319
We're ready to bring him out now.

42:26.640 --> 42:29.679
Wait a minute, Oswald.
What did that man say to you?

42:30.960 --> 42:34.479
- Revelation.
- Oswald Danes!

42:34.600 --> 42:36.439
(CHEERING AND WHOOPING)

42:36.560 --> 42:40.439
That's the keyword. Stick to the script,
OK? Say "revelation".

42:59.920 --> 43:01.559
Kind of hard to see.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.279
What do I want?

43:08.400 --> 43:11.159
That's the question.

43:13.560 --> 43:16.239
All these years on this Earth,

43:16.360 --> 43:17.959
what do I really want?

43:18.080 --> 43:20.519
MAN IN CROWD: Children, you bastard!

43:20.640 --> 43:22.599
(BOOING AND SHOUTING)

43:22.720 --> 43:23.959
No.

43:24.080 --> 43:26.079
Because that's...

43:26.200 --> 43:31.079
my curse. I'm cursed with the knowledge
of that deep down in my soul, sir.

43:32.840 --> 43:34.719
And that's my tragedy.

43:34.840 --> 43:37.679
It's who I am. I... Wh...

43:37.800 --> 43:39.919
MAN IN CROWD: You're a loser!

43:40.040 --> 43:41.959
All these...

43:43.080 --> 43:44.919
All right.

43:45.040 --> 43:50.559
All these fancy words, they're no help
to me. And these... These...

43:52.560 --> 43:54.519
...these won't help me either.

43:58.600 --> 44:00.439
The truth is I know what I am.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.679
And I know what you are too.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.319
Yes, I do.

44:08.440 --> 44:12.239
Each and every one of you.

44:12.360 --> 44:15.119
Because I know for certain...

44:15.240 --> 44:18.639
what has happened to the human race.

44:18.760 --> 44:24.479
I know,
because this has happened before.

44:26.240 --> 44:29.959
50,000 years BC.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.879
What's called the Great Leap Forward.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.039
Human beings suddenly...

44:38.880 --> 44:40.519
...we started to bury our dead.

44:40.640 --> 44:43.959
We created art and money...

44:45.040 --> 44:46.839
...and love.

44:46.960 --> 44:50.039
They loved. They learned to love.

44:50.160 --> 44:54.199
We made a leap from animal...

44:54.320 --> 44:57.999
to human. And now, right now,

44:58.120 --> 45:00.879
in our very own lifetimes...

45:01.000 --> 45:04.239
it has happened again.

45:04.360 --> 45:07.479
The next Great Leap.

45:10.520 --> 45:13.679
We have made it from animal to human...

45:13.800 --> 45:15.599
to what?

45:15.720 --> 45:17.999
This is the question.

45:18.120 --> 45:20.039
After Miracle Day...

45:21.640 --> 45:22.919
...what are we now?

45:23.040 --> 45:24.399
I know.

45:24.520 --> 45:29.599
This is something I know,
because I am the man...

45:29.720 --> 45:32.919
who has lost heaven for ever.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.799
So I can feel the truth of it.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.919
I'm telling you...

45:40.640 --> 45:44.879
...man...has risen again!

45:45.000 --> 45:46.439
(CHEERING)

45:46.560 --> 45:48.959
Now he has a new name.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.239

...is...
