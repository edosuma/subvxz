Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:56.972 --> 00:59.743
Well?
This is it.

01:00.008 --> 01:03.012
Wow, baby.
This is so romantic.

01:03.512 --> 01:04.811
Yeah.

01:04.813 --> 01:07.083
Nothing but the best
for my best girl.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.910
I think there's
something out there.

01:33.776 --> 01:36.143
I'm sure it's just the wind
or a cat or something.

01:36.145 --> 01:38.449
No baby, I'm serious.

01:46.990 --> 01:48.458
I'll go check it out.

02:12.281 --> 02:13.850
Be right back.

02:50.085 --> 02:52.088
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

02:54.190 --> 02:56.323
Oh God it hurts!

03:00.729 --> 03:03.000
Oh God!

04:00.423 --> 04:02.960
<i>It's a girl.</i>

05:58.975 --> 06:00.042
Jason.

06:03.813 --> 06:06.283
- Jason!
- Casey?

06:06.383 --> 06:08.314
You got such
a beautiful name.

06:08.316 --> 06:09.453
Casey.

06:09.852 --> 06:11.384
Casey.

06:11.386 --> 06:13.487
I could see why you
might want to call me that.

06:13.489 --> 06:16.727
Okay. Mom.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.360
Sorry.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.232
She's your mother.
Show some respect.

06:24.232 --> 06:25.801
Sure thing, Mr. Pollack.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.302
Stop trying to impress
your sister's friends.

06:29.304 --> 06:30.973
Mom, that's disgusting.

06:32.275 --> 06:33.407
Don't get your hopes up,
Becky.

06:33.409 --> 06:34.441
Becky thinks you're a loser.

06:34.443 --> 06:36.076
All right, you guys.

06:36.078 --> 06:37.143
Get it all out
of your system

06:37.145 --> 06:39.078
or else you're gonna be
sleeping outside tonight.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.917
Not you, Becky.
You're cool.

07:13.883 --> 07:15.152
Hey.

07:15.852 --> 07:16.617
How are you?

07:18.354 --> 07:20.020
Steve's an a-hole.

07:22.390 --> 07:23.256
He knew three weeks ago,

07:23.258 --> 07:25.025
so I don't really care
what he thinks.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.960
He can bring in a sub.

07:26.962 --> 07:29.398
Okay. It's all right.
Go back to sleep.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.804
I can't sleep.

07:34.003 --> 07:36.205
I'm starting to pick up
too much energy.

07:37.539 --> 07:39.006
James.

07:39.008 --> 07:40.340
How about you, kids?

07:40.342 --> 07:42.412
Anyone else feel that
sweet energy?

07:43.546 --> 07:44.978
Your mom didn't tell you
the cabin's built

07:44.980 --> 07:46.379
on a pile of magic rocks?

07:46.381 --> 07:48.581
Okay, we don't need
to get into this with them.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.286
Get into what?

07:54.189 --> 07:55.323
Your mom's trying
to cure me.

07:55.325 --> 07:57.490
Please tell me we're not
going to a hippie commune.

07:57.492 --> 07:59.960
No, we're not going
to a hippie commune.

07:59.962 --> 08:01.331
It's just a vacation.

08:02.164 --> 08:06.066
On top of a deposit
of iron oxide.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.533
Don't overthink it!

08:07.535 --> 08:09.069
There are places like this
all over the world.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.306
It's totally normal.

08:37.399 --> 08:39.232
Your mom's friend Mika
is into hoodoo.

08:39.234 --> 08:41.168
She's not into hoodoo.

08:41.169 --> 08:42.534
It's what she does
for a living.

08:42.537 --> 08:44.102
Does what for a living?

08:44.105 --> 08:45.338
Becky doesn't want
to hear this, right?

08:45.340 --> 08:46.973
Yeah, Becky wants
to hear this.

08:46.975 --> 08:48.107
You want to hear this,
right?

08:48.109 --> 08:49.376
I, I do want to hear this?

08:49.378 --> 08:51.111
Yeah. See?
She wants to hear this.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.046
All right, this is just
what Mika told me.

08:53.048 --> 08:56.349
But she said
that if you live

08:56.351 --> 09:00.987
on top of this energy
for a while,

09:00.989 --> 09:06.025
then it kind of realigns
everything inside of you.

09:06.027 --> 09:07.527
Sounds kind of like
bullshit.

09:07.529 --> 09:10.032
Yeah well, let's hope
this bullshit works.

09:38.527 --> 09:39.258
That's it?

09:39.260 --> 09:40.996
Help your dad
with the bags.

09:41.430 --> 09:43.262
I'm really sorry about this.

09:43.264 --> 09:45.031
It's okay.

09:45.033 --> 09:45.967
Really?

09:45.969 --> 09:46.900
Because I thought
it was gonna be like,

09:46.902 --> 09:48.736
fun in the mountains,
not weird, creepy

09:48.738 --> 09:50.136
energy house.

09:50.138 --> 09:51.671
Seriously, it is fun.

09:51.673 --> 09:53.208
Sounds creepy.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.208
Oh, Mika says
that the front door

09:55.210 --> 09:56.609
is gonna be locked.

09:56.611 --> 09:58.312
We have to go
around the side.

09:58.314 --> 09:59.512
It's supposed to be
cooler on the inside.

09:59.514 --> 10:01.180
Well, by "cooler,"
I hope you mean warmer

10:01.182 --> 10:03.085
because it's freezing.

10:04.286 --> 10:06.122
All right, buddy.
Help me lift...

11:08.450 --> 11:10.019
What do you think?

11:10.686 --> 11:12.422
Well, it's a house.

11:13.388 --> 11:14.521
What do you think?

11:14.523 --> 11:16.725
Kind of rustic.

11:17.225 --> 11:18.794
Wait â€˜til we get
the fire going.

11:23.199 --> 11:24.434
It's nice.

11:27.402 --> 11:28.368
Honey, go open
the front door

11:28.370 --> 11:30.305
and help your brother
with the groceries.

11:34.442 --> 11:36.211
Thank you.

11:44.452 --> 11:45.419
No, you're good.

11:45.421 --> 11:46.252
Let me help.

11:46.254 --> 11:47.854
I already dragged
you out here.

11:47.856 --> 11:50.125
I don't need you to help
with the groceries.

11:51.793 --> 11:53.861
Are you gonna be okay
in here with them?

11:53.863 --> 11:55.395
They're just your parents.

11:55.397 --> 11:57.731
Yeah.
But they're crazy.

11:57.733 --> 11:59.469
Go help your brother.

12:00.168 --> 12:01.537
Okay.

12:13.249 --> 12:15.451
Thank you for doing this.

12:17.485 --> 12:19.188
I know you don't,

12:20.255 --> 12:21.155
I know you don't
really want to be...

12:21.157 --> 12:23.359
Maybe it'll work.

12:38.673 --> 12:40.576
Honey, look.
It's snowing.

12:58.293 --> 12:59.793
What are you doing?

12:59.795 --> 13:01.464
Uh, nothing.

13:06.301 --> 13:07.434
I feel better already.

13:07.436 --> 13:08.635
Ha-ha.

13:08.637 --> 13:09.906
I do.

13:11.806 --> 13:15.611
This is the best I have felt
in a very long time.

13:17.378 --> 13:19.215
What else could
a guy want?

14:13.869 --> 14:16.035
<i>It was here during
one spring vacation</i>

14:16.037 --> 14:18.804
<i>that a young family came
to enjoy some rest</i>

14:18.806 --> 14:20.873
<i>and relaxation.</i>

14:20.875 --> 14:22.578
And gain a bit of hope.

14:28.383 --> 14:32.051
<i>But what they found
was the opposite.</i>

14:32.053 --> 14:34.721
<i>Ending with four
gruesome murders,</i>

14:34.723 --> 14:37.493
<i>and a still missing
teenage girl.</i>

14:39.927 --> 14:43.764
<i>All at the hands of one
Casey Pollack.</i>

14:43.766 --> 14:46.967
<i>Who would soon become
known in the press as...</i>

14:46.969 --> 14:48.805
<i>the "Axe Mom."</i>

14:53.308 --> 14:55.809
<i>Casey Pollack worked
the night shift as a nurse,</i>

14:55.811 --> 14:57.777
<i>coming home most mornings
just in time</i>

14:57.779 --> 14:59.578
<i>to make her children
their lunches</i>

14:59.580 --> 15:01.580
<i>and see her husband
off to work</i>

15:01.582 --> 15:04.920
<i>as a local high school
physical education teacher.</i>

15:06.088 --> 15:08.755
<i>But her family
is in terrible danger.</i>

15:08.757 --> 15:11.558
<i>Casey Pollack,
the loving wife and mother,</i>

15:11.560 --> 15:12.958
<i>is an illusion</i>

15:12.960 --> 15:15.797
<i>hiding a terrible
monster inside.</i>

15:17.432 --> 15:19.665
<i>Detective Dean Walker,
a 14 year veteran</i>

15:19.667 --> 15:21.601
<i>of the Mt. Ryerson
Police Department</i>

15:21.603 --> 15:24.440
<i>remains lead detective
on the Pollack case.</i>

15:25.907 --> 15:27.573
Detective Walker,

15:27.575 --> 15:29.742
Casey Pollack's crimes were

15:29.744 --> 15:32.047
by any standard heinous.

15:32.980 --> 15:35.881
Was this something you believe
she thought of beforehand?

15:35.883 --> 15:38.084
What she did was
incomprehensible.

15:38.086 --> 15:41.921
And the amount of planning
that went into it...

15:41.923 --> 15:44.359
She knew exactly
what she was doing.

15:46.394 --> 15:48.060
The way she performed
the killings...

15:48.062 --> 15:51.564
The sheer number of
executions she performed

15:51.566 --> 15:53.702
in such a short period
of time...

15:54.702 --> 15:56.870
with zero remorse,
none.

15:56.872 --> 16:01.375
She made no attempt
to hide what she had done.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.477
<i>It was here,
at Shand Healing Estates</i>

16:04.479 --> 16:07.514
<i>a service specializing
in spiritual retreats</i>

16:07.516 --> 16:09.915
<i>that Casey began planning</i>

16:09.917 --> 16:11.653
<i>her family getaway.</i>

16:27.668 --> 16:30.972
Mm. Sorry about
the smell in here.

16:31.407 --> 16:32.639
It doesn't smell.

16:32.641 --> 16:34.544
It doesn't smell
gross in here?

16:35.109 --> 16:36.878
It's probably just wet.

16:38.614 --> 16:41.017
Yeah, the fucking
drawer's stuck.

16:45.954 --> 16:47.857
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

17:20.454 --> 17:23.626
Do you think that's
the cabin that we're in?

17:25.092 --> 17:28.063
Yeah, looks like it.

17:41.009 --> 17:42.478
Dad?

17:42.910 --> 17:44.013
Jason?

17:44.847 --> 17:46.581
Mr. Pollack?

17:49.083 --> 17:52.020
Ladies,
let's go find their ax.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.988
Get those boots on,
pronto.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.490
Pronto?

17:56.492 --> 17:58.157
Yeah. Pronto.

17:58.159 --> 18:01.531
You, too... blonde girl.

18:03.831 --> 18:05.699
Becky, Dad.
Her name's Becky.

18:05.701 --> 18:06.599
Becky.

18:06.601 --> 18:09.869
Of course.
It's the cancer.

18:09.871 --> 18:10.971
Let's go.

18:10.973 --> 18:13.810
Just go get the bags first,
'kay?

18:15.577 --> 18:16.946
All right.

18:29.992 --> 18:32.759
The ladies are in this room
with the two beds.

18:32.761 --> 18:34.528
You and I...

18:34.530 --> 18:35.831
are in here.

18:36.197 --> 18:38.764
Wait, wait.
We're sharing a room?

18:38.766 --> 18:41.169
Ah shit.
Not cool.

18:44.805 --> 18:46.106
The service up here sucks.

18:46.108 --> 18:47.107
I told my grandma
I'd let her know

18:47.109 --> 18:48.174
I got here safe.

18:48.176 --> 18:50.980
Uh, there's a landline.
Go ahead and use that.

18:54.081 --> 18:55.917
- It's dead.
- Shit.

18:57.019 --> 18:58.117
Batteries.

18:58.119 --> 18:59.821
Is there another one?

19:02.157 --> 19:04.190
James, is there a phone
in the bedroom?

19:04.192 --> 19:06.262
<i>I, I didn't see one.</i>

19:08.163 --> 19:09.828
Sorry, honey.
Is Lily gonna worry?

19:09.830 --> 19:11.998
I had texted her from the car
that we're almost here.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.169
It's okay, Mrs. Pollack.

19:13.668 --> 19:15.638
You girls wanna
help me cook dinner?

19:17.872 --> 19:18.938
Brrr.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.674
No luck on the ax.

19:20.676 --> 19:22.110
I'm gonna check the flu.

19:23.244 --> 19:25.078
Then we'll look for wood.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.816
In the woods.

19:48.102 --> 19:49.772
Ready to go?

19:50.071 --> 19:51.006
Jason?

19:51.974 --> 19:52.906
Jason!

19:52.908 --> 19:55.107
What? Uh, no, sorry,
I can't right now.

20:05.620 --> 20:06.486
Last chance.

20:06.488 --> 20:08.221
I'll uh,
I'll help you get it lit.

20:08.223 --> 20:09.792
That's not the hard part.

20:16.231 --> 20:18.732
- James!
- What?

20:18.734 --> 20:20.202
Sorry.

20:21.837 --> 20:22.836
Don't look, kids.

20:24.973 --> 20:25.938
Where are you going?

20:25.940 --> 20:26.806
Getting the wood.

20:26.808 --> 20:27.973
Be careful out there.

20:27.975 --> 20:29.611
Wolves love me.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.883
I'm a wolf person!

21:50.725 --> 21:51.692
Dad?

21:51.694 --> 21:53.225
He's probably out
in the woods somewhere.

21:53.227 --> 21:54.793
I'm not going out there.

21:54.795 --> 21:56.762
What if he needs help
carrying the wood?

21:56.764 --> 21:58.498
Mm, he probably doesn't.

22:00.101 --> 22:01.269
Mom?

22:02.369 --> 22:04.005
She's cooking.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.710
Make sure she
can't anything.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.822
Uh, no thanks.

22:23.225 --> 22:25.191
I'm so glad that you could
come with us this trip.

22:25.193 --> 22:26.425
This would've been worse
than the year

22:26.427 --> 22:28.293
we went to Hoover Dam.

22:29.330 --> 22:30.996
You know,
with my uncle's RV.

22:30.998 --> 22:32.197
- Yeah.
- Oh my God.

22:32.199 --> 22:34.166
My grandma was having a book
club meeting this weekend,

22:34.168 --> 22:36.502
so, glad I could
get out of the house.

22:36.504 --> 22:39.105
God, those old ladies make
the living room sell like,

22:39.107 --> 22:41.473
like weird meat and mint.

22:42.511 --> 22:44.376
That's like weirdly specific.

22:44.378 --> 22:46.479
No, it's gross, though.
It's like a meat cream.

22:46.481 --> 22:47.981
Yeah, that sounds gross.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.854
How is she,
by the way?

22:52.788 --> 22:55.155
She's okay.
She got sick last week.

22:55.157 --> 22:56.455
I know.

22:56.457 --> 22:57.859
You said.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.293
She's okay,
though, right?

23:01.295 --> 23:05.200
Yeah. You know.
Lily's Lily.

23:06.368 --> 23:08.233
Well, she's not that bad.

23:08.235 --> 23:09.402
Oh, come on.

23:09.404 --> 23:10.270
She's not like my parents.

23:10.272 --> 23:12.374
They watch me
every fucking second.

24:02.290 --> 24:04.857
What causes this woman...

24:04.859 --> 24:06.059
to act in this manner?

24:06.061 --> 24:08.927
Her, her killings
surely were ritualistic,

24:08.929 --> 24:11.499
but I believe her motive
was greed.

24:12.434 --> 24:13.936
Pure and simple.

24:15.637 --> 24:17.406
It's the oldest motive
in the world.

24:20.140 --> 24:22.075
<i>Now, things did get
out of hand</i>

24:22.077 --> 24:23.242
<i>and she lost control,</i>

24:23.244 --> 24:27.816
<i>but greed was
the original motivator.</i>

24:30.349 --> 24:33.289
And it was a direct result
of her husband's diagnosis.

24:34.289 --> 24:37.326
James recently updated his will
to include his children.

24:37.626 --> 24:40.092
<i>For Detective Walker
and the rest of the officers</i>

24:40.094 --> 24:41.360
<i>on the Pollack case,</i>

24:41.362 --> 24:45.063
<i>the changing of James's will
seemed like an airtight motive.</i>

24:45.065 --> 24:48.300
<i>But some didn't believe
Casey's motivation</i>

24:48.302 --> 24:50.472
<i>was quite so simple.</i>

24:51.171 --> 24:52.571
<i>Up next...</i>

24:52.573 --> 24:55.040
<i>We sit down with one of the
only people who's heard</i>

24:55.042 --> 24:58.310
<i>Casey Pollack speak since
the traumatizing events.</i>

24:58.312 --> 25:01.417
Right here on Inside Crime.

25:11.959 --> 25:14.559
I'm not ashamed to admit
I have values.

25:14.561 --> 25:17.297
But you don't have to preach
the gospel to realize

25:17.299 --> 25:19.331
that something's wrong
in this country.

25:19.333 --> 25:20.666
When the dream
of a better life

25:20.668 --> 25:21.601
is out of reach for some

25:21.603 --> 25:24.205
while others continue
to use the system

25:24.371 --> 25:26.507
for their own selfish ends.

25:27.074 --> 25:30.076
As Governor,
I'll end the war on values.

25:30.078 --> 25:32.011
And I'll fight against
attacks on our quest

25:32.013 --> 25:33.713
for a better world.

25:33.715 --> 25:36.249
Belief makes us strong.

25:36.251 --> 25:40.485
It is belief that will deliver
us to a better tomorrow.

25:47.728 --> 25:51.100
I'm Leslie Bison
and I approve this message.

26:00.641 --> 26:02.341
Yeah right.

26:02.343 --> 26:03.144
Try it.

26:04.446 --> 26:06.948
- Okay, what do I do?
- Just inhale.

26:12.587 --> 26:15.154
You all right?

26:16.690 --> 26:17.757
I'm fine.

26:17.759 --> 26:19.428
It takes some
getting used to.

26:20.028 --> 26:21.661
God, my grandma's
gonna kill me.

26:21.663 --> 26:24.530
She might kill you.
She could kill you.

26:24.532 --> 26:26.499
I just don't want
her to worry.

26:26.501 --> 26:27.466
She's old.

26:27.468 --> 26:29.537
Oh, come on.
What are you talking about?

26:30.371 --> 26:33.005
You're like the best
good girl I know.

26:33.007 --> 26:34.741
She has nothing
to worry about.

26:34.743 --> 26:37.076
Yeah, well,
sometimes it seems like

26:37.078 --> 26:39.648
I'm more capable of taking
care of her than she is.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.714
Like, the other day,

26:42.716 --> 26:44.282
I came downstairs

26:44.284 --> 26:46.184
and she was just
watching the TV.

26:46.186 --> 26:49.688
Not blinking.
Her mouth was wide open.

26:49.690 --> 26:51.156
I had to call her name
three times

26:51.158 --> 26:53.091
before she realized
I was even there.

26:53.093 --> 26:55.028
She started acting
normal again.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.230
Not that weird.

26:57.232 --> 26:59.699
My grandma used to do
the same thing.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.370
Yeah, but...

27:02.469 --> 27:04.138
The TV was off.

27:05.439 --> 27:07.109
I'm sorry.

27:08.642 --> 27:10.309
It's okay.

27:10.311 --> 27:13.115
You know,
what can you do?

27:23.257 --> 27:25.026
Shit.

27:41.242 --> 27:42.508
Are you just
gonna leave it?

27:42.510 --> 27:44.609
Yeah. It was from
the disgusting,

27:44.611 --> 27:46.546
dirty smokers who were
here before us.

27:46.548 --> 27:49.118
Ah, I like the way
you think.

27:50.150 --> 27:51.419
Let's go.

28:52.379 --> 28:54.082
Dump in the pasta.

29:02.423 --> 29:04.259
What's taking him so long?

29:04.826 --> 29:06.462
He'll be fine.

29:07.361 --> 29:08.729
Give it a stir.

29:10.697 --> 29:12.767
What are you looking for?
Ghosts?

29:13.868 --> 29:15.571
What?
What do you mean?

29:17.205 --> 29:18.674
Nothing.

29:19.474 --> 29:21.510
Really.
It's just that...

29:25.179 --> 29:29.749
I've just heard things
about these woods.

29:29.751 --> 29:31.751
And the spirits
that live here.

29:31.753 --> 29:33.418
- Stop it.
- What?

29:33.420 --> 29:35.721
- You're scaring us.
- Oh, I'm not scared.

29:35.723 --> 29:38.624
I'm just saying
it's not unheard of to...

29:38.626 --> 29:41.694
see things out there
in the dark night.

29:41.696 --> 29:43.432
Mom!

29:44.498 --> 29:46.734
Sorry.
You're too easy.

29:57.411 --> 29:58.743
Hey, everything all right?

29:58.745 --> 30:00.713
<i>Yes.
How's your timing?</i>

30:00.715 --> 30:01.647
<i>Did you pick the trees yet?</i>

30:01.649 --> 30:04.684
I have the spots.
Pulling up shortly.

30:04.686 --> 30:05.551
<i>We need to make sure</i>

30:05.553 --> 30:07.388
it happens the way
it's supposed to.

30:08.723 --> 30:10.889
<i>We have to complete
the cycle.</i>

30:10.891 --> 30:11.924
I just think...

30:11.926 --> 30:13.896
<i>Don't think.</i>

30:15.330 --> 30:16.495
<i>Snow's starting
to come down.</i>

30:16.497 --> 30:18.463
<i>It's gonna be heavy out
there tonight so be careful.</i>

30:18.465 --> 30:20.665
I was born and raised
in these woods.

30:20.667 --> 30:22.638
I'll be just fine.

31:36.644 --> 31:37.913
Jason!

31:46.721 --> 31:48.023
Oh my God!

31:49.623 --> 31:50.858
Casey, help!

31:51.024 --> 31:52.727
<i>Casey! Help!</i>

32:01.034 --> 32:02.568
What do you want
me to do?

32:02.570 --> 32:03.735
- Just do it.
- Who is this?

32:03.737 --> 32:05.070
Jesus, Casey.

32:05.072 --> 32:07.440
Okay.
Pull her hair back.

32:07.442 --> 32:08.340
Is she dead?

32:08.342 --> 32:09.777
I just found her.

32:12.980 --> 32:14.579
One-thousand two,
one-thousand three,

32:14.581 --> 32:16.051
one-thousand four.

32:18.852 --> 32:20.086
One-thousand two,
one-thousand three,

32:20.088 --> 32:21.723
one-thousand four.

32:23.523 --> 32:25.090
One-thousand two,
one-thousand three...

32:29.097 --> 32:31.300
Oh fuck!

32:32.699 --> 32:33.701
What happened?

32:34.769 --> 32:36.402
She was literally lying
face down in the snow

32:36.404 --> 32:37.773
when I found her.

32:39.107 --> 32:40.940
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

32:40.942 --> 32:42.477
What's your name?

32:43.711 --> 32:45.478
Leslie Bison.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.046
Okay. Leslie.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.318
What were you doing
in the woods?

32:50.917 --> 32:52.920
I was looking
for some help.

32:54.088 --> 32:57.088
Leslie, we're gonna get you
to a hospital now, okay?

32:57.090 --> 32:58.491
No, that's all right.

32:58.493 --> 33:00.561
I think I'm all right.

33:01.829 --> 33:03.632
I just need to get warm.

33:33.895 --> 33:35.564
Anyone hungry?

33:36.030 --> 33:37.398
Nope!

33:42.035 --> 33:43.671
I am.

33:47.608 --> 33:49.411
Let me just wash my face.

33:50.645 --> 33:52.647
Leslie, why don't you
take a seat?

33:58.051 --> 33:59.184
Get the car started.

33:59.186 --> 34:00.519
You want me to go?

34:00.521 --> 34:01.619
Not all the way.

34:01.621 --> 34:04.589
Just until you get a signal
to call an ambulance.

34:04.591 --> 34:06.427
Can you help me out?

34:08.161 --> 34:09.864
Thanks, beautiful.

34:21.775 --> 34:24.178
Well, thanks for grabbing me.

34:27.514 --> 34:30.451
Leslie, I'm gonna go down
and get you some help.

34:31.485 --> 34:32.920
Sure.

34:37.625 --> 34:39.190
I'll be back.

34:39.192 --> 34:40.558
You good?

34:40.560 --> 34:42.196
Yes, go.

35:29.810 --> 35:31.076
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

35:31.078 --> 35:33.215
Hi. I'd like to report
an injured woman.

35:37.951 --> 35:39.784
<i>We know that before
she committed the murder,</i>

35:39.786 --> 35:42.690
<i>she traveled back down
the hill alone...</i>

35:44.090 --> 35:47.628
<i>to alert the paramedics about
what she was about to do.</i>

35:49.830 --> 35:52.230
She wanted to get caught
in that moment.

35:52.232 --> 35:54.800
Something in that
twisted brain of hers

35:54.802 --> 35:56.701
didn't want to go
through with it.

35:56.703 --> 36:00.741
And I wish she had gotten
help right then and there.

36:02.342 --> 36:04.643
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

36:04.645 --> 36:07.313
<i>Hi, I'd like to report
an injured woman.</i>

36:07.315 --> 36:09.614
<i>We found her unconscious
in the woods</i>

36:09.616 --> 36:11.585
<i>and we were able
to resuscitate her.</i>

36:11.918 --> 36:13.619
There's been some
inconsistency

36:13.621 --> 36:14.853
and confusion in the case,

36:14.855 --> 36:18.726
uh, especially in regards to
this mysterious injured woman.

36:19.694 --> 36:21.759
We now know there
was no injured woman.

36:21.761 --> 36:23.596
The police reports time it out

36:23.598 --> 36:26.801
so that the call occurred
before she even murdered Mika.

36:28.969 --> 36:31.302
That wasn't the only
call Casey Pollack made

36:31.304 --> 36:32.304
before the murders.

36:32.306 --> 36:35.674
She also placed a call
to Becky's grandmother,

36:35.676 --> 36:36.978
Lily Lane.

36:37.344 --> 36:39.811
The call was very short.

36:39.813 --> 36:41.246
She just wanted
to let me know

36:41.248 --> 36:44.085
that my granddaughter
had arrived safely.

36:45.853 --> 36:49.154
And then she told me they'd
found an injured woman.

36:49.156 --> 36:51.090
Before I could ask
any questions,

36:51.092 --> 36:53.791
she claimed to lose reception

36:53.793 --> 36:56.598
as she drove up
the hill to the cabin.

36:58.232 --> 37:00.869
I haven't heard
from her since.

37:06.906 --> 37:09.775
<i>Most people only live here
in the summer months.</i>

37:09.777 --> 37:11.175
<i>Martha and Carl Hastings</i>

37:11.177 --> 37:14.179
<i>are year-round residents
in Mt. Ryerson.</i>

37:14.181 --> 37:17.284
<i>They're the only eyewitnesses
we have from that night.</i>

37:17.384 --> 37:19.384
I heard some screaming.

37:19.386 --> 37:20.988
Woke me up.

37:21.154 --> 37:23.822
Then I heard Carl calling me
from the kitchen.

37:23.824 --> 37:26.659
I, uh, I looked down
from the kitchen door

37:26.661 --> 37:28.326
towards the pier.

37:28.328 --> 37:30.731
And that's when I saw
the two ladies in a struggle.

37:32.065 --> 37:34.234
<i>That's when Martha
called the police.</i>

37:38.139 --> 37:39.841
Dr. Ramsey.

37:40.875 --> 37:45.313
Is there such a thing
as pure evil?

37:45.980 --> 37:49.715
I don't believe
that exactly.

37:49.717 --> 37:54.719
<i>But I definitely saw
something in Casey that...</i>

37:54.721 --> 37:56.690
<i>I can't explain.</i>

37:56.891 --> 37:58.924
The events
are terribly tragic.

37:58.926 --> 38:01.830
Too many people lost their
lives to a very sick woman.

38:03.029 --> 38:04.096
<i>But the fact remains</i>

38:04.098 --> 38:06.701
<i>that there's still
a missing girl out there.</i>

38:09.469 --> 38:11.739
<i>And there's a family who</i>

38:13.040 --> 38:15.310
does not have one ounce
of closure.

38:16.409 --> 38:18.009
And that's terribly
frustrating

38:18.011 --> 38:19.913
as lead detective
on this case.

38:22.348 --> 38:23.751
So,

38:24.851 --> 38:28.822
tell me a little bit
about yourselves.

38:29.389 --> 38:31.025
Are you three in school?

38:32.359 --> 38:33.891
What grade are you in?

38:33.893 --> 38:35.728
Uh, graduated.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.232
But these two are juniors.

38:37.764 --> 38:41.935
Wow. Congratulations
on the graduation.

38:56.083 --> 38:56.882
Hello?

38:56.884 --> 38:59.217
<i>Hi, Lily.
It's Casey.</i>

38:59.219 --> 39:00.518
<i>Oh, hi, Casey.</i>

39:00.520 --> 39:01.853
I'm just calling
to let you know

39:01.855 --> 39:03.288
that we made it
to the cabin safely.

39:03.290 --> 39:04.822
You guys having fun?

39:04.824 --> 39:06.023
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:06.025 --> 39:08.994
We found an injured woman
in the woods.

39:08.996 --> 39:10.429
Oh, that's terrible.

39:10.431 --> 39:13.232
<i>She's gonna be okay.
I called an ambulance.</i>

39:13.234 --> 39:15.768
Oh, Becky's a tough cookie.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.436
I'm sure she'll be
helpful to you.

39:17.438 --> 39:20.204
<i>Becky is a tough cookie,
yes.</i>

39:20.206 --> 39:22.306
Yes, I will.

39:22.308 --> 39:24.777
I... I'm losing you.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.848
<i>I'll call
you in the morning, okay?</i>

39:45.065 --> 39:47.398
Don't we usually say grace
before we eat?

39:47.400 --> 39:48.900
Not usually.

39:48.902 --> 39:50.402
Uh, yeah we do.

39:50.404 --> 39:52.139
I think it's rude.

39:52.505 --> 39:54.806
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

39:54.808 --> 39:57.244
We can say grace if that's
what you all like to do.

39:59.313 --> 40:01.081
Take my brother's hand.

40:12.192 --> 40:15.561
Oh Lord, we thank you
for your many gifts.

40:15.563 --> 40:18.462
And for this bounty
we are about to receive.

40:18.464 --> 40:20.199
Please bless our family

40:20.201 --> 40:22.403
and our new friends
joining us in this meal.

40:23.503 --> 40:25.871
And bless our friends
and family everywhere.

40:25.873 --> 40:26.572
Amen.

40:26.574 --> 40:28.176
Amen.

40:34.447 --> 40:36.047
Paramedics are on their way.

40:36.049 --> 40:37.482
Paramedics?

40:37.484 --> 40:40.154
Yeah. We need
to make sure you're okay.

40:42.956 --> 40:44.424
Good idea.

40:44.991 --> 40:46.994
- Is there anything left for me?
- Yep.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.933
This is Mika Shan's cabin,
right?

40:52.532 --> 40:53.931
Yeah.

40:53.933 --> 40:56.000
How do you know Mika?

40:56.002 --> 40:57.971
She rents this place out
to people who are dying.

41:01.007 --> 41:03.342
I'm sorry.
Are you a renter?

41:03.344 --> 41:04.375
I'm confused.

41:04.377 --> 41:06.478
Which one of you is,
uh, sick?

41:06.480 --> 41:07.311
Leslie.

41:07.313 --> 41:09.547
You're not being
very cool right now.

41:09.549 --> 41:11.151
Sorry?

41:11.652 --> 41:14.188
Where did you say
you were renting again?

41:14.520 --> 41:16.089
I didn't.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.359
I'm not a renter.

41:20.393 --> 41:22.027
That's not how
I know Mika.

41:22.029 --> 41:24.128
- Then how do you know...
- Why were you in the woods?

41:24.130 --> 41:26.063
Why are you
interrogating me?

41:26.065 --> 41:28.402
Why don't we wait outside
for the ambulance?

41:29.936 --> 41:32.003
I was in the woods.

41:32.005 --> 41:33.975
On my way here.

41:34.607 --> 41:38.446
Next thing I know,
I'm on your front lawn.

41:40.114 --> 41:42.083
With your tongue
in my mouth.

41:44.585 --> 41:45.650
Excuse me?

41:50.456 --> 41:52.125
I'm kidding!

41:53.594 --> 41:55.960
Kids,
go in the other room.

41:55.962 --> 41:57.663
No. I'm not leaving you
in here with her.

41:57.665 --> 42:00.101
Do you mind if I...?

42:07.975 --> 42:09.574
All right, look.
I apologize.

42:09.576 --> 42:11.946
I thought I was being funny.

42:14.114 --> 42:16.184
But it wasn't funny.

42:17.685 --> 42:19.520
You saved my life.

42:20.087 --> 42:22.056
I'm sorry. I'm...

42:24.058 --> 42:25.460
I'm sorry.

42:27.027 --> 42:28.897
It's all right.

42:34.134 --> 42:35.132
Okay.

42:35.134 --> 42:36.500
Mm.

42:36.502 --> 42:38.372
Feels good to eat.

42:38.672 --> 42:39.538
What are you saying?

42:39.540 --> 42:41.273
She's just complimenting
the food.

42:41.275 --> 42:42.741
- It's good.
- Is it?

42:42.743 --> 42:44.411
Yeah.

42:49.683 --> 42:52.253
I'm two seconds away from
tying that lady to a chair.

43:10.703 --> 43:12.337
Leslie,

43:12.339 --> 43:14.574
could you sit back down,
please?

43:16.476 --> 43:17.946
Leslie.

43:36.730 --> 43:39.534
Okay. Grab your things.
Let's wait on the porch.

43:40.734 --> 43:42.469
Fine.

44:13.500 --> 44:14.502
No!

44:25.645 --> 44:27.614
Jessica!
Jessica!

45:31.777 --> 45:33.244
Nicely done.

45:52.598 --> 45:53.633
Shh.

46:31.638 --> 46:33.273
<i>Jessica!</i>

47:05.339 --> 47:06.840
Jason?

47:18.518 --> 47:19.683
Jess!

47:55.322 --> 47:56.457
Go!

47:58.759 --> 48:00.561
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

48:16.842 --> 48:18.446
Come on!
Come on!

48:25.585 --> 48:26.920
Go!
Go, go!

48:30.857 --> 48:32.393
Mom?

48:45.538 --> 48:48.508
Chill. Chill. Chill.

48:49.409 --> 48:50.744
Okay, c'mon.

48:51.610 --> 48:53.380
Gimme your hand.

48:53.647 --> 48:55.382
You're okay.

48:55.614 --> 48:57.114
Shh.

48:57.116 --> 48:59.319
It's okay.

49:18.505 --> 49:20.074
Listen.

49:38.090 --> 49:39.859
If I leave for a second,

49:41.094 --> 49:43.630
to see what's happening,
will you be okay?

49:46.933 --> 49:49.469
Hey!

50:01.848 --> 50:03.583
Shh. Shh.

50:05.552 --> 50:06.851
It's okay.

50:09.556 --> 50:10.654
It's okay.

50:10.656 --> 50:13.493
Shh. It's okay.
It's okay.

50:22.101 --> 50:23.134
Hey!

50:23.136 --> 50:25.438
Hey!
Hey, over here!

50:29.543 --> 50:30.808
What are you doing to us?

50:30.810 --> 50:32.610
It's my turn, dear.

50:34.614 --> 50:36.014
Feel that?

50:36.016 --> 50:37.985
That's power, Casey.

50:41.688 --> 50:43.124
Help! Help!

51:07.246 --> 51:08.982
Shh.

51:25.197 --> 51:26.801
Okay, come on.

51:31.270 --> 51:33.006
Shh.

51:40.080 --> 51:41.715
They're above us.

51:42.147 --> 51:43.748
We should run
while they're inside.

51:43.750 --> 51:45.186
Don't leave me.

51:45.719 --> 51:47.054
I'm not gonna leave you.

51:56.897 --> 51:58.599
I think it's clear.

52:17.851 --> 52:19.683
Hey, hey! Hey!

52:19.685 --> 52:21.888
Hey, send help!
Help!

52:26.259 --> 52:27.759
Hi, Casey.

52:27.761 --> 52:30.027
Mika!
What are you doing here?

52:30.029 --> 52:31.663
I just came
to check on you.

52:31.665 --> 52:33.163
See how the house
is working out.

52:33.165 --> 52:34.199
At 11:30?

52:34.201 --> 52:36.833
- Casey, I don't...
- What the hell is going on?

52:36.835 --> 52:38.671
Calm down.

52:39.639 --> 52:42.639
- Tell me...
- Ah! Casey! Casey!

52:42.641 --> 52:43.808
What the fuck is going on!

53:23.850 --> 53:25.152
Awesome.

53:31.657 --> 53:33.127
Look who's awake.

53:33.627 --> 53:34.826
Mornin', hon.

53:34.828 --> 53:37.027
Do you mind relaxing
a little while longer?

53:37.029 --> 53:38.798
We're almost done here.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.373
How do I stop it?

53:49.375 --> 53:50.342
How do I change them back?

53:50.344 --> 53:53.110
At this point,
there's nothing you can do.

53:53.112 --> 53:55.648
No, there has to be
a way to reverse it.

54:07.726 --> 54:08.659
Hello?

54:08.661 --> 54:09.259
<i>Hey girl.</i>

54:09.261 --> 54:10.328
Getting close?

54:10.330 --> 54:13.797
Uh, yeah.
I'm almost there.

54:13.799 --> 54:15.199
About to lose service,
though.

54:15.201 --> 54:16.933
Well, look.
It went great.

54:16.935 --> 54:18.703
The ladies send their best.

54:18.705 --> 54:19.907
I'll tell you all about it.

54:20.306 --> 54:21.773
<i>Did they clear the road yet?</i>

54:21.775 --> 54:23.107
They're about halfway through.

54:23.109 --> 54:25.112
<i>Good.
Get up here quick.</i>

54:26.413 --> 54:28.145
Leslie.

54:28.147 --> 54:31.117
<i>Oh my.
I underestimated you.</i>

54:31.918 --> 54:33.183
I have your girl.

54:33.185 --> 54:34.787
You sure she doesn't
have you?

54:35.721 --> 54:36.956
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

54:38.958 --> 54:41.195
Well, don't do
anything stupid.

54:41.460 --> 54:43.427
I haven't touched
the boy yet.

54:43.429 --> 54:44.697
Talk to your mother.

54:45.397 --> 54:46.831
Mom!
Don't listen to her!

54:46.833 --> 54:47.998
<i>He's passionate.</i>

54:50.036 --> 54:51.768
Can we make an exchange?

54:51.770 --> 54:53.204
<i>Good idea!</i>

54:53.206 --> 54:54.938
You bring Mika up here

54:54.940 --> 54:56.373
and I'll give you your son.

54:56.375 --> 54:57.407
<i>Deal.</i>

54:57.409 --> 54:59.746
Great.
See you in a few.

55:00.746 --> 55:03.149
Thanks.
This is smart.

55:04.150 --> 55:06.750
Who are the ladies?
Who are the ladies?!

55:06.752 --> 55:07.418
The ladies?

55:07.420 --> 55:09.123
Who are the ladies?!

55:10.089 --> 55:13.291
No! No.
They have a, a home.

55:13.293 --> 55:16.063
About a mile
or so into the woods.

55:18.831 --> 55:20.098
Walk.

55:20.100 --> 55:21.868
I'm hurt.

55:22.735 --> 55:24.804
Okay, I give up!
Stop!

55:26.806 --> 55:28.308
Go, get up.

55:35.514 --> 55:37.447
I need to warn you,
though.

55:37.449 --> 55:40.351
There's no way for me
to know what they'll do.

55:40.353 --> 55:42.253
If they want you there,
they'll let you in.

55:42.255 --> 55:43.286
But if they don't...

55:43.288 --> 55:45.021
Can they help?

55:45.023 --> 55:47.860
If there's a way,
they'll know how.

56:28.534 --> 56:30.770
Uh, I'll stay here.

56:34.239 --> 56:35.842
Give me your foot.

57:11.043 --> 57:12.246
Casey.

57:12.545 --> 57:14.214
Casey, wait!

57:22.054 --> 57:23.422
Please!

57:27.226 --> 57:28.362
Casey.

57:29.362 --> 57:30.931
Casey.

57:32.431 --> 57:33.530
Casey!

57:35.134 --> 57:36.166
Casey!

57:53.319 --> 57:54.652
<i>Hey Paul,
up to the summit yet?</i>

57:54.654 --> 57:56.587
<i>Can you confirm
multiple trees?</i>

57:56.589 --> 57:58.157
<i>Copy.</i>

57:59.893 --> 58:01.893
I got past the first two.

58:01.895 --> 58:04.197
But I might need some help
with this third one.

58:05.130 --> 58:05.962
Looks like weather.

58:05.964 --> 58:07.533
It's coming down
pretty hard up here.

58:07.967 --> 58:09.333
<i>Standby.
Sending backup.</i>

58:09.335 --> 58:10.838
Copy that.

58:52.011 --> 58:53.947
<i>Casey...</i>

59:34.020 --> 59:35.989
Hi, Casey.

59:36.556 --> 59:39.123
Why don't you
put that thing down?

59:39.125 --> 59:41.128
Lily? I'm...

59:42.328 --> 59:42.994
Who are you?

59:42.996 --> 59:45.061
I'm just a very old woman

59:45.063 --> 59:48.134
who's been waiting
a very long time.

59:49.201 --> 59:50.668
How's Becky?

59:50.670 --> 59:54.304
Oh, she's sure grown.

59:54.306 --> 59:57.977
She's gonna blossom
into a brand new person.

59:59.145 --> 01:00:00.580
Come on.

01:00:07.185 --> 01:00:10.323
It's so warm.
What's happening?

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.226
It's the rock.

01:00:15.661 --> 01:00:19.232
It warms us.
It guides us.

01:00:22.768 --> 01:00:25.571
Come this way, child.

01:00:27.139 --> 01:00:28.172
<i>The fact remains</i>

01:00:28.174 --> 01:00:30.440
<i>that there's still a missing
girl out there.</i>

01:00:30.442 --> 01:00:32.643
<i>How do you explain
something like that?</i>

01:00:32.645 --> 01:00:34.311
<i>To answer this question,</i>

01:00:34.313 --> 01:00:35.712
<i>one must look
at the passions</i>

01:00:35.714 --> 01:00:38.184
<i>that inform
the murderous mind.</i>

01:00:38.518 --> 01:00:41.485
<i>But to truly understand
the mind of a predator</i>

01:00:41.487 --> 01:00:44.087
<i>we must examine her prey.</i>

01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:47.458
<i>Mika Shan, a rental agent
and spiritual healer,</i>

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.559
<i>who Casey coaxed
to their cabin</i>

01:00:49.561 --> 01:00:52.766
<i>then bound to a tree
and disfigured.</i>

01:00:53.699 --> 01:00:56.067
Oh, Casey.

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:58.235
If things had been different,
you could've joined us.

01:00:58.237 --> 01:01:00.137
You certainly have
the stomach for it.

01:01:00.139 --> 01:01:02.273
The stomach for what?

01:01:02.275 --> 01:01:04.407
- What's coming next.
- <i>Becky's grandmother...</i>

01:01:04.409 --> 01:01:06.210
<i>Lily Lane.</i>

01:01:06.212 --> 01:01:08.478
<i>The call was very short.</i>

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.114
<i>She just wanted
to let me know</i>

01:01:10.116 --> 01:01:12.650
<i>that my granddaughter
had arrived safely.</i>

01:01:12.652 --> 01:01:15.619
- Who are you?
- We've always been around.

01:01:15.621 --> 01:01:16.790
Right from the beginning.

01:01:18.123 --> 01:01:20.690
Some people call us witches.

01:01:20.692 --> 01:01:23.828
But I like to think of us
as a collection of old gals

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:26.329
who just care,

01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:28.768
and have the power
to do something about it.

01:01:29.335 --> 01:01:32.570
<i>Although this tragedy
occurred during spring break,</i>

01:01:32.572 --> 01:01:36.340
<i>the chill of winter continued
through March that year.</i>

01:01:36.342 --> 01:01:38.175
<i>The Pollack family set out</i>

01:01:38.177 --> 01:01:40.444
<i>for a nice few days
in the mountains,</i>

01:01:40.446 --> 01:01:43.746
<i>only to have their plans erupt
into madness and murder</i>

01:01:43.748 --> 01:01:46.719
<i>on their very first night
in the cabin.</i>

01:01:48.386 --> 01:01:50.320
What am I watching?

01:01:50.322 --> 01:01:51.721
The future.

01:01:51.723 --> 01:01:53.290
Listen.

01:01:53.292 --> 01:01:56.893
We've seen countless generations
destroyed by chaos.

01:01:56.895 --> 01:01:59.598
Destroyed by their own nature.

01:02:00.433 --> 01:02:02.532
And when we can...

01:02:02.534 --> 01:02:05.469
we like to move
the big picture forward.

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:09.206
Like to find people
who can do it for us.

01:02:09.208 --> 01:02:11.541
- <i>Belief makes us strong...</i>
- Like her?

01:02:11.543 --> 01:02:15.746
<i>It is belief that will deliver
us to a better tomorrow.</i>

01:02:15.748 --> 01:02:18.618
Well, she's the horse
we're betting on.

01:02:20.552 --> 01:02:25.125
We used to be able to look
into a glass or flames.

01:02:25.924 --> 01:02:27.858
Searching for a glimpse

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:30.097
of what was going
to come next.

01:02:31.397 --> 01:02:35.435
But now, we can pick up
the signal direct.

01:02:38.371 --> 01:02:40.139
It's all inevitable.

01:02:46.378 --> 01:02:49.313
Can you help me?
How do I save my family?

01:02:49.315 --> 01:02:52.516
You're not the only one
who's made a sacrifice.

01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:54.286
I gave them Becky.

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.922
I'm not gonna pretend I didn't
know what was going on.

01:02:57.924 --> 01:02:59.623
<i>This was the cabin</i>

01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:02.259
<i>where a mother gruesomely
burned the bodies</i>

01:03:02.261 --> 01:03:05.262
<i>of her husband
and two children.</i>

01:03:06.531 --> 01:03:08.734
Shh! Shh.

01:03:09.235 --> 01:03:10.833
Stop it.

01:03:10.835 --> 01:03:12.570
You've got to go

01:03:12.572 --> 01:03:15.275
and collect
the stone fragments.

01:03:15.808 --> 01:03:18.308
To do this, you must
sever their heads,

01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:19.845
then burn them.

01:03:20.346 --> 01:03:23.717
It's the only way
to set them free.

01:03:27.485 --> 01:03:30.489
The paths that define us
have already been chosen.

01:03:31.824 --> 01:03:33.393
Go!

01:03:50.342 --> 01:03:53.846
The ritual's almost complete.

01:04:17.837 --> 01:04:19.406
Fucking bitch.

01:04:52.505 --> 01:04:54.574
I just want the fragments.

01:04:55.007 --> 01:04:58.645
You saw the ladies.
And they kept you alive?

01:05:03.315 --> 01:05:05.018
Well, it's no matter.

01:05:05.784 --> 01:05:06.819
Your family's mine.

01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:23.703
Help me bring
the boy to cycle.

01:05:43.956 --> 01:05:46.693
Hey Martha.
Did you hear that?

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.870
What is going on
out there?

01:06:25.431 --> 01:06:27.163
Oh!

01:06:27.165 --> 01:06:29.935
Oh, Carl, I have
to call the police.

01:07:11.944 --> 01:07:13.143
Oh my God.

01:07:13.145 --> 01:07:15.978
Yes, a woman and a girl.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:17.047
Please hurry.

01:07:17.049 --> 01:07:19.585
Holy shit.

01:07:23.721 --> 01:07:25.157
Walker.

01:07:26.659 --> 01:07:28.061
Come again?

01:07:29.194 --> 01:07:30.929
Yeah, I'm on my way.

01:07:49.547 --> 01:07:51.614
Jason!
Oh my God.

01:07:51.616 --> 01:07:53.085
You're okay.

01:07:53.219 --> 01:07:54.485
We have to get out of here.

01:08:15.807 --> 01:08:17.140
You should be nicer to me.

01:08:23.715 --> 01:08:26.084
Oh yeah.
Ha ha ha.

01:08:27.285 --> 01:08:29.121
I'm gonna
kill you for this.

01:08:30.288 --> 01:08:32.492
No you're not, dear.

01:08:34.058 --> 01:08:35.761
I'll leave you devils to it.

01:11:23.829 --> 01:11:25.231
Ma'am, put down the ax.

01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.796
Put down the ax

01:11:26.798 --> 01:11:28.967
and get down
on the ground now!

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:55.992
<i>For Casey Pollack,</i>

01:11:55.994 --> 01:11:57.359
<i>the truth of that
gruesome night</i>

01:11:57.361 --> 01:11:59.264
<i>is locked away with her.</i>

01:11:59.431 --> 01:12:02.435
<i>Unknowable to police
and psychiatrists alike.</i>

01:12:03.502 --> 01:12:05.402
<i>Perhaps in time,</i>

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:07.336
<i>she will be able to share
what really happened</i>

01:12:07.338 --> 01:12:10.372
<i>on March 21st, 2015.</i>

01:12:10.374 --> 01:12:12.309
<i>But more importantly,</i>

01:12:12.311 --> 01:12:15.214
<i>what became of Becky Lane?</i>

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.718
<i>Some stories will always
remain a mystery.</i>

01:12:19.817 --> 01:12:21.518
<i>And the case
of the Axe Mom</i>

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.790
<i>could be one of those.</i>

01:12:25.022 --> 01:12:27.823
<i>While we can examine
the facts...</i>

01:12:27.825 --> 01:12:31.230
<i>we may never really
know the truth.</i>

01:12:33.397 --> 01:12:36.132
<i>From everyone here
at Inside Crime.</i>

01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:37.868
Thank you for watching.

01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:39.469
I'm Jack Sterling,

01:12:39.471 --> 01:12:42.441
and I'll see you next week.

01:12:59.258 --> 01:13:01.390
Please let me go!

01:13:01.392 --> 01:13:03.295
I won't say anything.

01:13:06.231 --> 01:13:07.500
Oh my God.

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.268
What's happening?

01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:13.269
You're part of a bigger
picture, dear.

01:13:16.874 --> 01:13:18.944
It'll all be over soon,
I promise.

01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:27.018
No! No!

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.300
Please, help me.

01:13:59.317 --> 01:14:00.483
Here we go.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.600
