03:51.314 --> 03:52.857
Thank you both for coming.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.943
Emerald City needs all the heart
and courage it can get right now.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.446
Got your back, straw man.
You can count on us.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.364
Oh? You can count now, can you?

04:00.365 --> 04:03.826
Oh, boy. Sounds like somebody
needs an oil change.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.745
What'd you do?
Forget to prime your pump?

04:05.746 --> 04:09.165
Oh, very brave. I think that
crown has gone to your head.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.125
- Can it, rust bucket!
- Oh, how dare you!

04:11.126 --> 04:13.586
I'll show you how! Come on,
funnel-head! Let's go!

04:13.587 --> 04:15.921
Clank, clank, clank!
Anybody in here?

04:15.922 --> 04:17.505
Oh, yeah. That just happened.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.634
Break it up, you two knuckleheads.
We're in a grave situation here!

04:20.635 --> 04:22.470
- Ah, sorry.
- Yeah.

04:22.471 --> 04:26.098
- I-I guess we're all a little on edge, huh?
- Copy that.

04:26.099 --> 04:29.185
But with all of Oz at risk,
I need you two to stand guard...

04:29.186 --> 04:31.020
while I try to contact Dorothy.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.814
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"Contact Dorothy"? How?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.566
I'm a genius, remember?

04:35.567 --> 04:38.694
But she's probably forgotten
all about us by now.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.947
Whoa, yeah. It's been a long time.

04:41.948 --> 04:46.035
For us my friends, yes. But time in Oz
passes differently than in her world.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.662
It's been years since she
destroyed the Wicked Witches,

04:48.663 --> 04:51.957
but to her it's going to
seem like only yesterday.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.251
Well, let's hope she got
a good night's sleep.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.713
Now, you two keep an eye
on that broomstick while I...

04:59.216 --> 05:01.675
- Oh, too late!
- Secure the chamber!

05:01.676 --> 05:04.095
We've got to
get through to Dorothy.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.808
Dorothy. Scarecrow to Dorothy.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.268
Come in, Dorothy. Come in, Dorothy.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.268
Dorothy!

05:25.617 --> 05:27.660
Toto.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.245
We're home.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.463
Em, over here. Look at this.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.674
That twister took out
everything in its path.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.843
Knocked the house
right off its foundation.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.136
- Do you think we can fix it?
- I don't know.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.339
That's an awful lot of damage.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.475
Uncle Henry!

05:51.476 --> 05:54.179
Auntie Em?

06:06.408 --> 06:08.033
Dorothy?

06:08.034 --> 06:10.578
- Oh.
- Dorothy.

06:11.496 --> 06:14.039
It's not fair!

06:14.040 --> 06:17.084
Oh, I know, sweetie.

06:17.085 --> 06:20.129
It's not fair. But
it's just a house.

06:20.130 --> 06:23.465
If we have to find another
one, we'll find another one.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.885
- No. We can't just leave.
- Dorothy,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.761
we gotta face facts.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.014
Look at the barn.
Look at the house.

06:30.015 --> 06:33.684
We'll have to have it all appraised,
but we shouldn't get our hopes up.

06:47.824 --> 06:51.201
Move back. Move back.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.830
We need to create a halo of
safety around this disaster area.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.457
Thank you.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.167
Excuse me. This is our home.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.336
Your home.

07:00.337 --> 07:04.006
A home is where you live.
This is a disaster area.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.675
Oh. Can this not be adjusted?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.677
Then do it. Thanks so much.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.256
- And who are you?
- I'm the Appraiser.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.642
Are you with the government?
I didn't see a badge.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.976
Don't be rude, Dorothy.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.850
Oh, outspoken.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.941
We're... government adjacent.

07:24.194 --> 07:27.196
Hmm. Broken support beams,
cracked concr...

07:27.197 --> 07:29.114
Are you writing this down?
Thank you.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.241
Cracked concrete footing.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.910
- Ah!
- Hey!

07:32.911 --> 07:36.872
- What do you think you're doing?
- That thing was about to fall.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.708
I probably just saved your life.
But I don't need any recognition.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.752
Just doing my job.

07:41.753 --> 07:44.338
Now, I've made
a thorough assessment,

07:44.339 --> 07:47.918
and I'm afraid you'll
have to vacate immediately.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.386
- What?
- Read this.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.846
There's no reason to kick
us out. We can fix it.

07:52.847 --> 07:56.016
- Dorothy, hold on.
- I'll fix it myself if I have to.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.144
So sorry, but according
to the state of Kansas,

07:59.145 --> 08:02.147
the fate of this property
is decided by me,

08:02.148 --> 08:05.192
not some little girl.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.446
Flea-bitten, dirty,
possibly rabid...

08:09.447 --> 08:11.740
You, do something useful.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.328
You've got until...

08:16.329 --> 08:18.330
sunset to vacate the premises.

08:18.331 --> 08:22.710
Meet me at the shelter in town to sign the
paperwork, or we'll be back to throw you out!

08:22.711 --> 08:24.128
- Oh, oh...
- Good seeing ya.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.300
Well, that's that.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.678
- Better start packing.
- What? No!

08:32.679 --> 08:34.263
You heard what the man said.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.015
If he says the house is unsafe,
I won't have you in it.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.933
Who is he to decide that?

08:38.934 --> 08:40.936
It's totally... it's-it's fixable.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.938
These are
grown-up decisions, Dorothy.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.190
Sorry, but you're gonna
have to leave this to us.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.485
Well, I'm not leaving.
This is our home.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.279
Dorothy!

08:51.322 --> 08:53.407
Let's give her a little time, Em.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.610
She's been through a lot.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.126
Anybody home?

09:13.303 --> 09:15.846
Look, Toto, we can fix this.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.601
Shh. You'll scare them.

It must be some kind
of optical illusion.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.160
That's no illusion, Toto.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.088
Run!

12:52.480 --> 12:54.147
Help, Toto!

12:54.148 --> 12:59.195
Help!

13:26.389 --> 13:27.973
Dorothy!

13:27.974 --> 13:29.891
- Hi, kiddo!
- Scarecrow?

13:29.892 --> 13:31.852
What is this? What's happening?

13:31.853 --> 13:37.399
We're flying you back to Oz in a
rainbow mover. I invented it.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.942
- Show-off.
- Cowardly Lion?

13:38.943 --> 13:42.904
It's just Lion now.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.073
- See?
- Oh, my.
- Dorothy.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.325
Hi, Tin Man.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.119
I am so overjoyed to see you.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.915
You guys, dragging me into a
giant rainbow really scared me.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.876
I can only imagine
how you must feel.

13:55.877 --> 14:00.756
Trapped alone in a giant rainbow.
Surrounded by colors.

14:00.757 --> 14:04.968
It must be just horrible! Oh!

14:04.969 --> 14:07.929
Ever since he got his heart,
he's been all over the place.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.015
I never had emotions before.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.851
I just want to try them all out.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.936
Dorothy, we don't have much time.

14:14.937 --> 14:18.148
There's trouble in Oz, and only
you... threatening the land...

14:18.149 --> 14:20.484
and you are the only one
who can stop...

14:20.485 --> 14:22.235
What's that noise?

14:22.236 --> 14:23.779
Hold that door!

14:23.780 --> 14:26.031
- What's going on?
- Hang on, Dorothy.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.742
- We'll explain everything when you get here.
- Where?

14:28.743 --> 14:31.578
Emerald City!
I-In the Wizard's chamber.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.623
I smell flyin' monkeys!

14:34.624 --> 14:36.958
- Oh, no.
- Monkeys!

14:36.959 --> 14:39.503
Dorothy. Scarecrow to Dorothy.
Come in, Dorothy.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.630
- The door...
- Scarecrow to Dorothy.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.882
Is starting to give!

14:43.883 --> 14:46.259
I've lost contact with Dorothy.
I can't get her back!

14:47.929 --> 14:50.055
I can't hold it!

14:50.056 --> 14:51.973
Time's up!

14:51.974 --> 14:53.801
Aaah!

14:54.644 --> 14:56.353
Hurry!

14:56.354 --> 14:58.272
Come on!

15:10.326 --> 15:12.995
Oof!

15:22.463 --> 15:25.006
I can't believe it, Toto.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.209
We're really back in Oz.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.724
Wait. Scarecrow?

15:34.725 --> 15:36.393
Scarecrow!

15:41.774 --> 15:43.476
Oh, great.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.156
Come on, Toto. We've got
to get to Emerald City.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.735
It sounds like the guys
are in trouble.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.747
If only Glinda were here.
She'd know what to do.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.625
Now, now. Oops.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.962
No, don't push.
I'm coming right along.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.884
Please, if...

16:08.885 --> 16:13.013
If you would just
give me my wand back.

16:13.014 --> 16:16.263
Oh, now, you don't want to do that.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.896
Don't say I didn't warn you.

16:20.897 --> 16:24.858
Magic in the wrong hands can
be a very dangerous thing.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.319
Oh, Glinda.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.120
Sweet Glinda.

16:37.121 --> 16:40.081
Ah, the Jester.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.335
I am so thrilled to have
you as my guest.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.837
I'm captivated.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.422
Isn't it wonderful...

16:47.423 --> 16:50.050
when two great powers
as you and I...

16:50.051 --> 16:51.968
meet face-to-face,

16:51.969 --> 16:55.222
Peer-to-peer, toe-to-toe?

16:57.058 --> 16:59.476
My, but you're... silly.

16:59.477 --> 17:02.979
"Silly"? By "silly,"
surely you mean diabolical.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.106
No?

17:05.107 --> 17:07.275
You're laughing.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.152
It's the costume, isn't it?

17:09.153 --> 17:12.155
I know, I know.
Hard to take me seriously.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.281
It's my curse. Literally.

17:14.282 --> 17:19.788
I can't take this off... ever.

17:19.789 --> 17:24.251
My wicked sister did this to me with
one of her funny little spells.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.796
I knew your sister all too well.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.632
I never knew she had
a sense of humor.

17:30.633 --> 17:34.463
It's not funny to me!

17:39.850 --> 17:45.146
But now I'm ready to embrace a
whole new role as ruler of Oz.

17:45.147 --> 17:49.067
And you're gonna give me your
Good Ozkeeping seal of approval.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.236
But I don't approve.

17:51.237 --> 17:55.740
The Land of Oz is already falling
into ruin because of you.

17:55.741 --> 17:59.536
No good can come
from the reign of a fool.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.999
Agh, Glinda.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.542
Glinda, Glinda, Glinda.

18:05.543 --> 18:11.548
You are such a disappointment,
just like all the others.

18:11.549 --> 18:15.051
What have you done to them?

18:15.052 --> 18:18.222
Even a fool has a few tricks
up his sleeve.

18:21.183 --> 18:24.853
The magic of that broomstick
belongs to someone else.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.521
Uh-uh-uh.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.940
But with this little baby,

18:28.941 --> 18:34.523
the magic is magnified
and becomes all mine.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.536
Dorothy Gale will stop you.

18:41.537 --> 18:47.167
She will find a way back to
Oz, and she will stop you!

18:47.168 --> 18:51.129
Ooh. "Dorothy Gale will stop you."

18:51.130 --> 18:54.507
Aren't I quivering?

18:57.303 --> 19:00.221
Where once your
living soul did dwell,

19:00.222 --> 19:03.767
now is nothing but an empty shell!

19:10.107 --> 19:11.358
Now do you approve?

19:11.359 --> 19:16.029
You rule, O generous Jester.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.447
Attagirl.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.625
Aw, come on! What is that?

19:28.626 --> 19:30.624
To my tower. Fly!

19:35.257 --> 19:36.966
Now just around this corner,

19:36.967 --> 19:39.844
- I'm sure there's a buttress we can slide down.
- Wait!

19:39.845 --> 19:42.263
That's the window we escaped from.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.391
We're just going around in circles!

19:44.392 --> 19:47.644
- Hmm.
- Some genius you turned out to be.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.073
Listen to that racket.

20:00.074 --> 20:03.076
- Sounds like they're wreckin' the place.
- I think that's me.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.123
How ironic to get a heart,
only to have it attack me.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.750
Oh, the pain! The pain!

20:10.751 --> 20:13.795
Gadzooks! I just realized
something horrible.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.841
Dorothy could be here any minute and
walk right into a flyin' monkey ambush.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.260
Oh, that is horrible. Empathy!

20:20.261 --> 20:22.220
Horror! Fear!

20:22.221 --> 20:27.642
How about I jump in there
and tear 'em all apart?

20:27.643 --> 20:30.562
Just rip 'em limb from limb!

20:30.563 --> 20:33.016
Let's use brains, not brawn.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.735
Oh.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.438
Wait a minute.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.989
I have a brilliant plan.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.824
- Ah, relief.
- Is it a...

20:42.825 --> 20:44.826
tear them all limb from limb plan?

20:44.827 --> 20:47.954
Nope. It's the tear him
limb from limb plan.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.414
Wha...

20:52.001 --> 20:54.249
Show me the girl.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.338
Not a toy! No touchies!
No touchies!

20:58.799 --> 21:01.301
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.011
Show me the girl.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.385
Show her to me, please.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.225
Aaah! The only person
who could threaten my plan...

21:09.226 --> 21:11.519
is here in Oz,
and I don't know where.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.981
Do you know how annoying that is?

21:14.982 --> 21:17.942
I can't let her beat me.
My plan is almost complete.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.195
And you better figure
out a way to help me,

21:20.196 --> 21:24.365
or you'll be grounded, and you
can kiss your wings good-bye.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.659
- Oh.
- Ah!

21:26.660 --> 21:28.536
Haven't we been though this before?

21:28.537 --> 21:31.164
I don't speak monkey.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.875
Come on, Toto. Let's go
find the yellow brick road.

21:33.876 --> 21:37.879
That's her? That's Dorothy Gale,
the witch slayer from Kansas?

21:37.880 --> 21:40.048
Why she's just a little girl.

21:40.049 --> 21:42.801
And she's headed for Candy County.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.553
Oh! Well, I'll just let her
taste their treats.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.557
Then their justice.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.135
You!

21:52.311 --> 21:55.230
Ready your minions. We're
going to double our efforts.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.773
Go to the Emerald City.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.399
Join the others.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.195
And don't come back without that
scarecrow, that lion and that tin can!

22:03.572 --> 22:06.533
I'll take care of the girl.

22:09.411 --> 22:13.873
Fly! Fly! Fly, my babies!

22:13.874 --> 22:16.623
Now for a little insurance.

22:18.379 --> 22:21.798
Moon and Earth and stars align.

22:21.799 --> 22:25.469
Show the wayward girl a sign.

22:36.105 --> 22:40.105
Oh, Toto. This doesn't look
like the Oz I remember.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.947
Emerald City must be
in that direction.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.740
- I think.
- Correct!

22:47.741 --> 22:51.369
Though I'm not sure I
would advise you to go.

22:51.370 --> 22:55.039
Lately, many are going,
but few are returning.

22:55.040 --> 22:59.419
Whoa. You are a really fa...

22:59.420 --> 23:02.755
fabulous... owl.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.174
Oh. You're very kind.
I usually hear "fat."

23:05.175 --> 23:08.553
But, of course, my theory is that I'm
just not quite the right height.

23:08.554 --> 23:11.014
If I were twice as tall,
for instance... Ooh!

23:11.015 --> 23:12.932
Aaah! Ow! Whoo!

23:12.933 --> 23:14.642
Ow! Oh!

23:14.643 --> 23:16.603
Oh! Oh, Oh! Ow!

23:16.604 --> 23:19.480
- Aaah!
- Uh, are you okay?

23:19.481 --> 23:21.566
Physically? Yes.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.485
But I do have a large piece of
bark lodged in my hindquarters...

23:24.486 --> 23:27.447
Oh! Sorry. I'm giving you
too much information, aren't I?

23:27.448 --> 23:29.240
I do that. My name is Wiser.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.993
Nice to meet you, Wiser.
I'm Dorothy Gale.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.953
The famous Dorothy Gale.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.455
And Toto.

23:35.456 --> 23:38.041
I'm a really big fan of your work.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.751
Timber!

23:39.752 --> 23:41.336
- Wow, you really...
- Know everything?

23:41.337 --> 23:43.671
- And...
- Finish other people's sentences?
Oh, no, I'm doing it again!

23:43.672 --> 23:46.049
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.509
I'll just go. Farewell,
Dorothy and Toto.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.178
No, w-wait.

23:50.179 --> 23:53.431
I need to get to Emerald City, and I
can't seem to find the yellow brick...

23:53.432 --> 23:55.892
- House? Wall? Fireplace?
- Road.

23:55.893 --> 23:59.896
Oh, of course. Why would you be
looking for a yellow brick wall?

23:59.897 --> 24:01.981
That's silly, at the very least.

24:01.982 --> 24:06.361
There's the high road, and then there's the
low road. I know every square acre of Oz.

24:06.362 --> 24:09.906
But why would you want me to come with
you? I'm a miserable traveling companion.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.866
- I talk incessantly.
- Yes, I...

24:11.867 --> 24:15.995
I require frequent rest stops at which, I
should warn you, I will also talk incessantly.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.498
It's a terrible habit, I know.
But habits are hard to break.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.291
If we could break them,
they wouldn't be habits.

24:20.292 --> 24:24.212
That's okay. I was hoping maybe
you could... fly me there.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.964
In what?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.924
Oh. Oh, you mean me?

24:27.925 --> 24:31.552
I suppose I could do that.
Only... I can't fly.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.389
I mean, I could in the past, but...

24:34.390 --> 24:36.474
There's no need to be embarrassed.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.685
Maybe you could just point the way.

24:38.686 --> 24:41.896
Ah. Actually,
it's in this direction.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.649
I know a shortcut
through Candy County.

24:44.650 --> 24:49.237
But I must warn you, if we're to travel
through Candy County, there's one rule.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.906
- What is that?
- You must obey the signs.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.485
Which will be difficult
since I'm quite hungry!

25:04.503 --> 25:06.671
Whoa.

25:06.672 --> 25:11.300
Y-You did say obey
the signs, right?

25:11.301 --> 25:13.970
Right.

25:13.971 --> 25:17.345
They must have changed
the rules. Follow me!

25:17.391 --> 25:19.600

You are all under arrest.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.863
- Under arrest?
- Yes.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.324
Sorry to say,
you have broken the law.

26:58.325 --> 27:02.245
I'm being arrested
by a giant marshmallow?

27:02.246 --> 27:06.332
Marshal Mallow. Second in command
of the garrison at Candy County.

27:06.333 --> 27:10.753
- What did we do?
- Violation of section eight, paragraph 12 of...

27:10.754 --> 27:14.006
- penal code 16165.
- Penal code 16165.

27:14.007 --> 27:17.009
- Eating candy.
- But we didn't know.

27:17.010 --> 27:20.931
I'm so very sorry, but
there is thorough signage.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.061
They didn't say that before.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.021
Cuff 'em.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.066
Mmm, licorice.

27:32.067 --> 27:35.945
Don't even think about
eating the restraints.

27:35.946 --> 27:38.197
And no licking!

27:38.198 --> 27:40.074
What are you gonna do with us?

27:40.075 --> 27:42.410
We're taking you to the
Candy Courthouse,

27:42.411 --> 27:45.079
where you will be tried
by Judge Jawbreaker...

27:45.080 --> 27:47.790
- The Hanging Judge?
- The Hanging...

27:47.791 --> 27:50.918
- I was going to say that.
- Sorry. I do that.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.621
He really does.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.548
Forward, march!

28:18.572 --> 28:20.781
Trust me. I've got
it all figured out.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.450
Easy for you to say.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.114
Ready, set...

28:27.956 --> 28:29.658
Run!

28:30.500 --> 28:32.710
"Run"? That's the plan?

28:32.711 --> 28:36.040
Mm-hmm. Engaging neural
synaptic simulation sequence.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.843
Holy smokes! They must have
called for reinforcements.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.471
- What do we do now?
- Abort! Abort! Abort!

28:43.472 --> 28:45.181
Jump!

28:45.182 --> 28:47.391
Flyin' lion comin' through.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.310
Ow.

28:50.812 --> 28:53.105
Yikes!

28:53.106 --> 28:56.059
Ouch!

29:03.075 --> 29:04.992
- Look out!
- Oh!

29:04.993 --> 29:07.495
Don't lose my head!

29:11.083 --> 29:12.625
Whoa-oh-oh!

29:12.626 --> 29:14.252
Tin Man, watch where
you're grabbin'!

29:14.253 --> 29:16.587
Slow.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.008
Left.

29:21.009 --> 29:24.383
Ah! No, no, no!

29:32.729 --> 29:36.399
Oh!

29:36.400 --> 29:38.526
Sudden severe disappointment.

29:42.489 --> 29:44.615
Perfect!

29:44.616 --> 29:45.992
Perfect?

29:45.993 --> 29:47.994
They're leaving Emerald
City, aren't they?

29:47.995 --> 29:50.329
- Dorothy can now safely retrieve our message.
- Oh.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.123
Actually, that is perfect.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.828
Yeah, apart from being
trapped in a sack.

30:06.013 --> 30:08.180
Order in the court!

30:08.181 --> 30:09.928
Order! Order!

30:10.934 --> 30:12.476
What's the charge?

30:12.477 --> 30:17.106
Violation of penal code 16165.

30:17.107 --> 30:20.568
- Eating candy, milord.
- Eating candy?

30:20.569 --> 30:25.072
That's the worst offense
on the Glycemic Index!

30:26.742 --> 30:28.492
Quiet in the peanut gallery.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.703
What do the defendants plead?

30:30.704 --> 30:33.080
- Guilty as charged.
- Who are you?

30:33.081 --> 30:36.334
- I'm your legal defense team.
- Why did you plead guilty?

30:36.335 --> 30:39.337
- Because this is his 499th arrest.
- Mm-hmm.

30:39.338 --> 30:43.716
Well then, it's time
to set an example.

30:43.717 --> 30:47.303
But the sign said,
"Eat all the candy you want."

30:47.304 --> 30:51.807
Your Honor, they are entitled to a
verdict from a jury of their Peeps.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.185
Oh, all right. What say ye, Peeps?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.647
- What are they saying?
- Peep, peep, peep a-cheep.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.191
Can't you hear that?

31:00.192 --> 31:01.484
Guilty!

31:01.485 --> 31:03.402
Let the punishment fit the crime.

31:03.403 --> 31:06.822
I hereby sentence you to death!

31:11.203 --> 31:12.828
I knew they'd go nuts for that.

31:12.829 --> 31:15.206
Death? For eating candy?

31:16.291 --> 31:18.084
- Marshal Mallow?
- Milord?

31:18.085 --> 31:22.046
I hereby order you to execute
uh, uh, the execution.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.798
- Me?
- Yes, you.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.467
But as an officer in the
Candy County Army,

31:26.468 --> 31:29.553
I can only follow orders
from General Candy Apple.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.514
- Bosh.
- Excuse me, Your Judgeship.

31:31.515 --> 31:33.182
- Names, please?
- What for?

31:33.183 --> 31:34.934
Your death certificates.

31:34.935 --> 31:37.061
- Wiser.
- Wiser with a "Z"?

31:37.062 --> 31:39.188
- Wiser with an "S."
- And your name is?

31:39.189 --> 31:41.148
Dorothy. Dorothy Gale.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.696
Dorothy Gale?

31:47.697 --> 31:50.032
The... The witch slaying
girl from Kansas?

31:50.033 --> 31:51.659
Well, sort of.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.577
Mallow, approach the bench!

31:53.578 --> 31:56.705
What the devil's food
is going on here?

31:56.706 --> 31:59.875
- Are you trying to make me look like a fool?
- Of course not, milord.

31:59.876 --> 32:04.505
This girl is one of the greatest
heroes Oz has ever known!

32:04.506 --> 32:06.590
She's well above reproach!

32:06.591 --> 32:09.844
You should know that!
Everyone knows that!

32:09.845 --> 32:13.013
What do they teach you
in the academy anyway?

32:13.014 --> 32:16.434
As Lord High Judge of this court,

32:16.435 --> 32:19.478
I hereby commute
the death sentence.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.398
Free the prisoners!

32:27.028 --> 32:28.571
Yes, milord,

32:28.572 --> 32:33.826
but the charges must stand until
General Candy Apple can be found.

32:33.827 --> 32:36.787
Well, where in confection is he?

32:36.788 --> 32:40.541
He was called to Emerald City days ago
but should have been back by now.

32:40.542 --> 32:45.748
Then I suggest, Marshal Mallow,
you go find him.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.634
Whew! Well, I don't know
about anyone else,

32:50.635 --> 32:53.338
but I could really go
for-for a little snack.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.224
- Too soon?
- Yes, I think so.

32:57.225 --> 33:00.019
Inappropriate.

33:04.566 --> 33:07.651
I'm terribly, terribly sorry
for all this, milady.

33:07.652 --> 33:11.238
It's just that I am duty bound
to follow the general's orders.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.282
- It's okay.
- Yes, we understand.

33:13.283 --> 33:16.410
I can't fathom what's taking
him so long to return.

33:16.411 --> 33:19.705
- Well, we're going to Emerald City.
- You're welcome to join us.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.416
I-Is that an order?

33:22.417 --> 33:25.211
No, no, it's an invitation.

33:25.212 --> 33:29.590
Well, in that case, I...
I believe I can.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.439
Wow, what a great wall.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.107
It's made of china.

33:47.108 --> 33:50.319
What a great wall of china.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.904
Halt!

33:51.905 --> 33:54.483
State your name and business.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.742
My name is Dorothy,

33:56.743 --> 33:58.953
and this is Marshal
Mallow and Wiser.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.996
We're trying to get through
to the yellow brick road.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.666
In order to cross the wall,
you'll need permission...

34:03.667 --> 34:08.295
from Her Royal Highness, the
princess of Dainty China Country.

34:08.295 --> 34:12.126
Ooh, ooh. Oh, so pretty.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.512
That was a warning shot.

34:16.513 --> 34:20.558
Oh, we should, um, respect
their national borders.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.353
Good comrade, sir,

34:25.355 --> 34:28.399
may we request an audience
with the Dainty China princess?

34:28.400 --> 34:31.110
No. She's otherwise engaged.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.779
I mean, she's busy getting engaged.

34:33.780 --> 34:36.031
She's welcoming suitors today.

34:36.032 --> 34:40.286
Suitors. Hmm. H-He-He's a suitor.

34:40.286 --> 34:43.206
Which one?

34:44.748 --> 34:46.667
Marshal Mallow is the suitor,

34:46.668 --> 34:50.629
and he would like to ask for the
hand of the Dainty China princess.

34:50.630 --> 34:55.676
- Oh.
- The princess? Oh. Well, why didn't you say so?

34:55.677 --> 34:58.221
Escort the giants in!

35:03.560 --> 35:05.762
Open the gates!

35:13.612 --> 35:17.197
But I don't want to be a suitor.
I don't want to get married.

35:17.198 --> 35:19.199
What if she's cute?

35:19.200 --> 35:23.370
Appearance isn't everything. The
name's Mallow, not "Shallow."

35:23.371 --> 35:24.743
Touché.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.858
Now get in there. You'll do great.

35:52.859 --> 35:56.820
Figures and figurines,

35:56.821 --> 35:59.907

- Milady.
- How is the city?

40:34.599 --> 40:38.226
- How many broken?
- No one broken, but many
cracked and chipped.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.145
And the city is severely damaged.

40:40.146 --> 40:42.689
That was a very heroic
thing you did back there.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.274
Just doing my duty.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.944
We have a mission
of the utmost importance.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.404
Menders, take that man
to the hospital. Quickly!

40:49.405 --> 40:50.864
Excuse me? Your Highness.

40:50.865 --> 40:53.909
May we please pass through your
country on the yellow brick road?

40:54.869 --> 40:57.371
No. You'll have to go around.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.958
But that could take weeks,
and my friends are in danger.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.793
Who do you think you are,

41:02.794 --> 41:06.088
interrupting royal business
with your petty travel plans?

41:06.089 --> 41:09.174
Can't you see we're in
a state of emergency?

41:09.175 --> 41:12.678
Yes, I do see. My home
is in trouble too.

41:12.679 --> 41:17.099
Perhaps you can make an exception
for Miss Dorothy Gale?

41:17.100 --> 41:18.850
- Oh!
- Oh.

41:18.851 --> 41:23.431
So this is the famous girl who
vanquishes wicked witches.

41:25.066 --> 41:27.317
- I thought you'd be taller.
- Milady,

41:27.318 --> 41:29.736
she is a very resourceful
young woman.

41:29.737 --> 41:33.031
Ah. Perhaps you'd rather
be a suitor to her.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.616
- That's not what I meant.
- Silence!

41:34.617 --> 41:35.943
Oh.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.621
These are troubled times in Oz.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.582
Behind our great wall, we are safe.

41:42.583 --> 41:46.461
Now and again the Jester sends an
earthquake or two just to rattle us.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.922
But never one so big.

41:50.508 --> 41:54.553
He must really be angry
about something...

41:54.554 --> 41:57.055
or someone.

41:58.725 --> 42:01.184
This is your fault.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.352
- What?
- Now just a min...

42:02.353 --> 42:03.854
Don't deny it.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.605
You wanted a little shortcut,

42:05.606 --> 42:09.026
so you forced your way in and brought
the Jester's anger with you!

42:09.027 --> 42:11.111
I don't know any Jester.

42:11.112 --> 42:14.906
I'm just trying to get to Emerald
City to see the Scarecrow.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.950
Maybe I can help
your people somehow.

42:16.951 --> 42:20.245
You're just a little girl from Kansas.
What could you possibly do?

42:20.246 --> 42:22.831
- But I...
- She doesn't even have a title.

42:44.020 --> 42:47.647
I'm going with you.

42:47.648 --> 42:49.232
What?

42:49.233 --> 42:52.027
- I'm going with you.
- No, milady.

42:52.028 --> 42:55.489
You mustn't go. You could be fractured
before you reach the river.

42:55.490 --> 42:58.075
If I don't go,
we could all be broken.

42:58.076 --> 43:00.410
Then I will send
the royal guard with you.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.496
No, that won't be necessary.

43:02.497 --> 43:05.200
Marshal Mallow will keep me safe.

Miss Dorothy Gale, the witch slaying
giant from Kansas, and her friends,

43:15.927 --> 43:18.512
will accompany me as my servants...

43:18.513 --> 43:20.972
on a mission
to Emerald City to meet...

43:20.973 --> 43:22.557
with the Scarecrow.

43:22.558 --> 43:24.351
With his eminent wisdom,

43:24.352 --> 43:28.728
we will surely find a way to end
the Jester's reign of tyranny.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.025
Bow to me.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.524

- Bow to me.

47:01.569 --> 47:04.738
or rather, you,
build this boat out of?

47:04.739 --> 47:07.324
- The owl?
- Uh, no.

47:07.325 --> 47:09.951
We'll figure it out.
How hard can it be?

47:09.952 --> 47:12.655
There are trees everywhere.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.166
Ow! Hey!

47:16.167 --> 47:19.586
Sorry. So sorry. I...

47:19.587 --> 47:22.756
How would you like it if I just walked
up to you and broke your arm off?

47:22.757 --> 47:25.425
Ow! I didn't mean any harm.

47:25.426 --> 47:27.218
We're trying to get
to Emerald City.

47:27.219 --> 47:30.180
And to do it we need wood...
to build a boat.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.931
- A boat!
- A boat?

47:31.932 --> 47:34.851
- You want to build a boat?
- You've got a lot of nerve.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.603
Not my idea.

47:36.604 --> 47:38.271
Hey, I know her.

47:38.272 --> 47:41.107
Isn't she the one that stole
the apples off Uncle Manny?

47:41.108 --> 47:42.776
- What?
- That's her.

47:42.777 --> 47:48.114
Ow, ouch, ow! Boy, those
trees really hold a grudge.

47:50.076 --> 47:52.825
At least we're out of range.

47:53.329 --> 47:54.704
- Ow.
- And stay out!

47:54.705 --> 47:58.205
Take me.

47:59.794 --> 48:02.087
Take me.

48:02.088 --> 48:06.800
I would like to volunteer these old
timbers as material for your boat.

48:06.801 --> 48:11.304
Oh, no. We could never
hurl a talking tree.

48:11.305 --> 48:12.931
At least not on purpose.

48:12.932 --> 48:16.101
I'm 978 years old.

48:16.102 --> 48:19.854
And honestly, I don't have
many rings left.

48:19.855 --> 48:24.067
I can stay here and rot,
taking up someone else's sun,

48:24.068 --> 48:30.073
or I can come with you and be part of
something important, something great.

48:30.074 --> 48:33.243
I don't know what to say.
Except thank you.

48:33.244 --> 48:36.698
Oh, this is a very brave
sacrifice you're making.

48:36.705 --> 48:39.374

Tugg, you do make a wonderful boat.

51:12.486 --> 51:15.530
Well, thank you, Princess.

51:35.551 --> 51:37.753
Land ho!

51:40.222 --> 51:42.056
Oh, my.

51:42.057 --> 51:45.101
What happened to this place?

51:45.102 --> 51:48.522
It used to be... so beautiful.

51:52.693 --> 51:55.112
Hello?

51:56.655 --> 52:00.109
Lion? Scarecrow?

52:00.701 --> 52:02.368
Tin Man?

52:02.369 --> 52:05.496
It's totally abandoned.

52:05.497 --> 52:07.199
Scary, huh?

52:11.253 --> 52:13.463
What a mess.

52:13.464 --> 52:16.549
General?

52:16.550 --> 52:20.630
- Scarecrow?
- General Candy Apple, sir?

52:21.347 --> 52:22.889
They've all gone.

52:22.890 --> 52:25.975
P-Perhaps they're having lunch.

52:25.976 --> 52:29.271
The courteous thing to do
would be to come back later.

52:30.064 --> 52:34.192
M-Much later. Hoo.

52:34.193 --> 52:36.361
This is where the
broomstick should be.

52:36.362 --> 52:40.406
No wonder things are going wrong.

52:40.407 --> 52:45.161
Oh, look. It's a prismatic tubular
inter-dimensional transporter device.

52:45.162 --> 52:46.245
- What?
- Huh?

52:46.246 --> 52:49.120
In simpler terms,
it's a rainbow mover.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.210
This is the machine
that brought me here.

52:52.211 --> 52:57.048
Technically the rainbow brought you here.
The machine created the rainbow.

52:57.049 --> 52:58.925
It's sort of
a chicken-and-the-egg thing.

52:58.926 --> 53:01.299
- Ahem.
- Ooh, sorry.

53:06.809 --> 53:09.352
Oh, my gosh. Dorothy,
that might be for you.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.813
What are the odds of that?
65 to 2? I mean...

53:13.440 --> 53:16.109
Dorothy, we don't have much time.

53:16.110 --> 53:18.945
There's trouble in Oz,
and only you can help us.

53:18.946 --> 53:21.322
An evil Jester is
threatening the land.

53:21.323 --> 53:25.494
His power comes from a magic scepter he
has at his castle. The scepter is...

53:30.874 --> 53:35.503
Well, well, well. If it isn't
the famous Dorothy Gale.

53:35.504 --> 53:37.171
You stay away from her!

53:37.172 --> 53:39.048
I'm not talking to you, puff ball.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.341
Hoo-hoo.

53:40.342 --> 53:43.011
- I, the princess of Dainty...
- Silence!

53:44.054 --> 53:46.973
All right, Jester, what have
you done with my friends?

53:46.974 --> 53:48.975
Your friends?

53:48.976 --> 53:53.146
What a coincidence. Why,
I've got them right here.

53:53.147 --> 53:54.731
See?

53:54.732 --> 53:57.984
- They have all the comforts of home.
- Yikes!

53:57.985 --> 53:59.944
Central heating.

53:59.945 --> 54:03.489
- Running water.
- No!

54:03.490 --> 54:09.078
- And the coziest accommodations imaginable.
- Save yourself Dorothy!

54:09.079 --> 54:11.038
You let them go!

54:11.039 --> 54:13.332
I give the orders around here now.

54:13.333 --> 54:15.168
So if you know what's good for you,

54:15.169 --> 54:18.963
you'll hop in your little rainbow mover
and go back to Kansas where you belong!

54:18.964 --> 54:23.593
- No.
- Either do as I say or die!

54:29.016 --> 54:30.767
Mallow, grab her!

54:30.768 --> 54:33.596
Right, milady.

54:34.146 --> 54:35.563
Owl my!

54:42.863 --> 54:44.947
Oh, why don't you
sing me a song, eh?

54:44.948 --> 54:47.571
Tugg! Tugg, let's move it!

54:48.285 --> 54:50.453
What's the rush?

54:50.454 --> 54:53.414
- Flying monkeys!
- Flying monkeys?

54:53.415 --> 54:56.118
Dorothy, take cover.
I'll fight them off.

55:01.507 --> 55:03.549
Here they come.

55:08.597 --> 55:11.095
- Goodness me!
- Oh!

55:13.018 --> 55:15.102
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

55:15.103 --> 55:16.521
Stop! Stop!

55:16.522 --> 55:18.397
Can't this old barge
move any faster?

55:18.398 --> 55:19.941
Hang on!

55:25.113 --> 55:29.159
Just try and keep up.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.831
Take that!

55:34.832 --> 55:39.043
Tugg, stay to the right!
Head for that cave!

55:39.044 --> 55:41.417
Aye, aye, Your Highness.

55:43.924 --> 55:45.967
They're on us!

55:48.345 --> 55:51.389
No! No, no, no, no, no!
You cowards!

55:51.390 --> 55:54.184
You're letting her get away!

55:57.604 --> 56:01.934
Why do I have to do
everything myself?

56:01.942 --> 56:05.903
They're not coming in.
They've left us.

56:05.904 --> 56:09.949
They must be afraid of
the dark! Ha! Nyctophobia!

56:09.950 --> 56:11.826
Ha! They act so tough.

56:11.827 --> 56:14.120
But I bet they sleep
with a night-light on.

56:14.121 --> 56:17.498
Silly, scaredy...

56:17.499 --> 56:20.418
I can't see a thing.

56:20.419 --> 56:23.004
Me neither! I'm terrified!

56:23.005 --> 56:24.630
You're nocturnal. Get a grip.

56:25.716 --> 56:28.044
Hey, I think I see a way out.

56:32.180 --> 56:34.223
What?

56:34.224 --> 56:36.142
Fireflies!

56:36.143 --> 56:39.770
I haven't seen you guys in ages.
Where have you been?

56:39.771 --> 56:43.357
Oh, they're... They're beautiful!

56:51.533 --> 56:55.158
That's the prettiest
thing I've ever seen.

57:00.626 --> 57:02.169
Milady.

57:03.503 --> 57:07.173
Oh, how romantic.

57:13.805 --> 57:16.679
Where do you think we're headed?

57:17.184 --> 57:18.267
Whoa.

57:18.268 --> 57:22.146
By that compass,
we are heading northwest,

57:22.147 --> 57:26.567
which means this little tributary
will take us to the Jester's castle.

57:26.568 --> 57:29.487
- Yes!
- Perfect! That's great.

57:29.488 --> 57:32.823
Under cover of darkness, we can
belly crawl past the guards...

57:32.824 --> 57:34.659
Then we can sneak in
and free my friends.

57:34.660 --> 57:37.036
Ah! We have a plan.

57:38.830 --> 57:43.334
Oh, there's a fork up ahead.

57:43.335 --> 57:45.583
Which way should we go?

57:47.130 --> 57:49.799
Let's follow the fireflies.
They seem to know.

57:49.800 --> 57:52.094
Looks like right... is right.

57:55.097 --> 57:56.594
Thank you, fireflies.

57:57.724 --> 58:00.226
Aha! It's the least I could do.

58:00.227 --> 58:03.813
Have a nice ride!

58:03.814 --> 58:08.190
See you next fall!

58:10.737 --> 58:13.072
Oh, no. It's a trap.

58:13.073 --> 58:15.157
Tugg, turn back!

58:15.158 --> 58:18.111
I can't! The current is too strong!

58:31.466 --> 58:33.339
Oh!

58:36.179 --> 58:37.930
Whoa!

58:42.811 --> 58:45.771
Everyone, hold on tight!

59:05.417 --> 59:10.755
Good-bye, Dorothy Gale.

59:10.756 --> 59:13.257
Good-bye.

59:13.258 --> 59:15.384
Say good-bye to Dorothy
Gale, everyone.

59:15.385 --> 59:18.095
Let that be a lesson to all of you.

59:18.096 --> 59:20.973
Don't... mess... with the Jester!

59:20.974 --> 59:24.678
What have you done?

59:28.315 --> 59:30.441
Mmm.

59:30.442 --> 59:33.236
Oh.

59:37.032 --> 59:39.326
Is everyone okay?

59:40.118 --> 59:43.037
You all right?

59:44.206 --> 59:46.165
- Yes, ma'am.
- Wiser?

59:46.166 --> 59:48.084
Hmm? Affirmative.

59:48.085 --> 59:50.127
Toto?

59:50.128 --> 59:52.751
- Tugg?
- Oh. A few splinters.

59:53.381 --> 59:55.591
China Princess?

59:55.592 --> 59:57.176
China Princess?

59:57.177 --> 59:59.220
Princess!

59:59.221 --> 01:00:00.888
China Princess!

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:05.810
Oh, no.

01:00:10.899 --> 01:00:15.104
Oh. I should have protected her.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.733
I neglected my duty.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.695
Mmm.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.571
Where are you going?

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.949
I'm going to confront
the Jester myself.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.951
I can't let anyone else get hurt.

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:06.704
- We won't let you go alone.
- Don't follow me.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:08.828
- But we've come this far.
- That's an order.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:32.605
How? How is it
possible she survived?

01:01:32.606 --> 01:01:34.607
Foiling those stupid
monkeys is one thing,

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:36.358
but surviving my waterfall trick?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.986
I mean, that's a good trick!

01:01:38.987 --> 01:01:42.441
Positively... humiliating.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:47.953
Idiot! This is all your fault!

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:51.123
Dorothy would be dead by now if it
weren't for this abysmal failure.

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:53.834
Your abysmal failure, pal.

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:57.463
How dare you ruin my perfect
record of jesterly awfulness?

01:01:57.464 --> 01:02:01.669
Well, don't say I didn't warn you,
you fuzzy evolutionary reject.

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:07.014
You're grounded!

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:10.935
Ready the castle! Roll out the
welcome mat for Miss Dorothy Gale.

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:14.813
She's going to get the kind of
reception that's to die for.

01:02:14.814 --> 01:02:16.561
Ow!

01:02:33.833 --> 01:02:36.786
Is there anything I can do?

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:41.882
Yes. Get some help.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:42.967
How?

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:47.048
Oh, I don't know,
smart guy! Figure it out.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:51.560
Forgive me.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:29.009
Ah!

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:33.055
- Ooh! Ooh!
- You're flying.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:35.185
You're flying!

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:38.063
I am? I am!

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:41.233
Ouch!

01:03:41.234 --> 01:03:43.986
I mean, I mean,
it's been a long time.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:53.203
I will find help, but I don't
know how long I can stay up.

01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:55.080
Believe in yourself, soldier.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.041
Dorothy's life depends on it!

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:58.834
Sir. Yes, sir.

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.958
Ooh, ooh.

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:07.718

Well, this is it, Toto.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.814
Hmm.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.782
Glinda!

01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:01.201
Oh, Glinda! I'm so glad to see you.

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:05.956
Hello, Dorothy and Toto.

01:08:05.957 --> 01:08:10.294
Welcome to the Jester's
wonderful palace.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:14.548
Glinda, what's wrong?

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:17.301
Nothing is wrong.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:20.679
Everything is simply delightful.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:21.805
Oh, no!

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:24.057
What has that horrible
Jester done to you?

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:27.685
The Jester isn't horrible.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:32.399
He's the most generous
Jester who ever lived.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:36.903
All hail the Jester!

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:41.234
All hail the Jester!
The generous Jester of Oz!

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:58.759
Scarecrow! Tin Man!

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.388
Lion!

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:06.015
Glinda. Somebody, help!

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:09.269
All hail the Jester!
The generous Jester of Oz!

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:12.564
What's wrong with all of you?
Why won't you help me?

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.267
Because I...

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:19.776
don't want them to!

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.495
Thanks, everybody!

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:28.622
Job well done.
Back to your cubbies.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:29.997
Thank you.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:33.210
All hail! All hail!

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:37.005
Aren't they just marvelous?

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:39.800
And so obedient.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:46.014
What have you done to them?

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:49.393
Don't worry. I won't let
them kick the bucket.

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:53.979
Besides, buckets are your
weapon of choice, aren't they?

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:56.809
Like the one full of water
you threw on my sister.

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:01.279
Your sister?

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.492
The Wicked Witch?
But I didn't mean to kill her.

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:07.411
Oh, don't apologize.

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:10.288
After all, she was wicked.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:15.168
And if it wasn't for your meddling,

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:18.380
this little baby might never
have found its rightful master.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:20.382
The witch's broomstick!

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:23.677
I gave that to the Wizard
for the protection of Oz.

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:27.055
You stole it! It belongs to me!

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:30.517
And no little girl from Kansas
is going to take it away!

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:33.019
Where once your living
soul did dwell...

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.690
Ah!

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:46.283
Get me outta here!
I can't see a thing!

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:48.368
Good work, Toto! Great job.

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:51.830
Dorothy.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:53.373
Is that you?

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:55.625
Oh, I was so worried about you.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.627
I'm so glad you guys are all right.

01:10:57.628 --> 01:11:00.630
Aw, I think things are better by
the minute now that you're here.

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:03.049
We were worried about you too.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:05.802
You are very brave
to come and rescue us.

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.846
That's not good! Get me outta here!

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:12.058
Your heart is stronger than
the Jester's magic any day.

01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:14.019
Ah!

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:14.978
It's beyond belief.

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:18.774
Come back here,
you fuzzy freak of nature!

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.737
- Come on!
- Right behind you, kiddo.

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:25.565
Let me at 'em!

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:29.242
You!

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:37.959
Oh, I see.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.629
Someone is feeling pouty.

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:45.967
I think I've let you hold
that scepter long enough.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:47.761
Now give it back!

01:11:49.514 --> 01:11:51.139
You!

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:53.600
Flea-bitten, dirty,
possibly rabid...

01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:55.811
Not you.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:58.438
This you. Just throw it to me!

01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:00.357
No! Throw it to me!

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:03.944
Hey, back off,
or I drop the little dog.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:05.529
Toto!

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:09.825
Sixty-two degrees north,
with a radial arc of 2.5...

01:12:09.826 --> 01:12:12.452
Please, tell me you're
calculating how I can eat 'im!

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:15.038
Tin Man, present arm.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:18.459
Loading concentric
projectile trajectory schematic.

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:22.379
No!

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.173
Toto!

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.752
Whoa!

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.818
Wiser, you're flying!

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:46.987
I know! I-I am!

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.866
- Isn't it fantastic?
- Oh, thank goodness.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:51.950
Yeah.

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:54.536
It's a simple matter
of wind speed...

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.913
thrust and...

01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:59.291
Aah! Ow! Oh! Ooh!

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:01.376
- Oh! Ooh!
- Bravery.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:03.336
I was going to say weight.

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:08.168
Aha!

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:14.306
No!

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:19.185
Tugg! Look at you!

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:21.313
Call me Tank now.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:23.273
- Dorothy Gale!
- Dorothy!

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:25.942
Princess, you're okay!

01:13:25.943 --> 01:13:28.396
Fractured, but not broken.

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:33.200
Why are people always
helping Dorothy Gale?

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:34.618
Ouch!

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:36.992
Troops deploy!

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:43.169
The cavalry has arrived! Hooray!

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:03.355
- Oh! This is all your fault!
- Oh!

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:06.858
Get the troops and destroy
those trespassers!

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:09.027
Go!

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:14.115
Brains, Heart and Courage Brigade
reporting for duty, sir.

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:17.202
Fall in, recruits. Glad
to have you on board.

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:22.123
Forward!

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.375
Battle stations!

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:25.043
Shotgun. I called shotgun!

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:27.872
Let's give these monkeys what for!

01:14:31.092 --> 01:14:34.094
- Ready the candypult!
- Gum balls loaded, sir.

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:37.595
- Here they come!
- Let fly!

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:44.938
Fire!

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:59.119
Fire!

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.788
Ahh!

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.339
Stop it!

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.542
Let 'em have it!

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:25.478
Soldiers, cake formation!

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:40.152
Charge!

01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:45.331
Gotcha!

01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:47.709
Knock yourself out! It's all straw!

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:06.061
How about this, you flyin' monkey?

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:11.855
Want some of this?

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:27.496
Where you going?
You fools! Come back!

01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:32.296
Ah, who needs 'em?

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:37.592
Winds of fortune, winds of fate,

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.595
winds come forth and eliminate...

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.514
Dorothy!

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:49.851
Oh, no.

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:51.439
Dorothy, run!

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.609
In a twister, you
fell from the sky.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.779
And in a twister, you shall die!

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:00.733
Everyone, run for cover. Now!

01:17:04.078 --> 01:17:06.246
Take shelter in the alcoves!

01:17:10.126 --> 01:17:11.999
Dorothy, wait.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:18.292
Attack!

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.621
- Oh!
- Stop!

01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:52.622
Well, aren't you a
persistent little Munchkin.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:18:00.008
The scepter's power
is mine to wield.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:04.137
Dorothy Gale, your fate is sealed!

01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:06.514
No!

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:11.479
Give... me... that.

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:45.220
Grab on!

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:50.180
Pull!

01:18:56.315 --> 01:19:00.861
Oh, Dorothy, I'm
forever in your debt.

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:04.155
The least I could do is,

01:19:04.156 --> 01:19:08.660
oh, I don't know, perhaps
help you rule Oz?

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:13.583
Oz has its leaders, and they
don't need this to rule.

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:20.046
No!

01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:23.251
My baby!

01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:41.735
Fly, fly. Don't ever leave me!

01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:04.382
Oh!

01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.558
Oh, Glinda. It's you.

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.393
- It's really you.
- Yes.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:18.104
The Jester's spell is broken,

01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:20.815
and we couldn't have
done it without you.

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.483
Oh, it wasn't just me.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:25.945
I couldn't have done
it without all of you.

01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:28.948
But Kansas must be
missing you by now.

01:20:28.949 --> 01:20:33.578
I'd love to stay, but I do
think I'm ready to go home.

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:36.414
Whatever will we do without you?

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:40.293
There will always be a rainbow
when you need one most.

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:41.878
Good-bye, Dorothy.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:43.755
Good-bye, my friends.

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:45.506
Good-bye, Dorothy.

01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:49.594
Dorothy.

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:54.640
For the first time ever,
I'm at a loss for words.

01:20:54.641 --> 01:20:57.310
Hoo.

01:20:57.311 --> 01:21:00.139
Which reminds me, there's actually
a very funny story about...

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.439
- Good-bye, Wiser.
- Hoo.

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:14.494
Good-bye, Dorothy.

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:16.697
And thank you.

01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:28.132
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Dorothy!

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:30.635
Good-bye, Dorothy. Good-bye.

01:21:30.636 --> 01:21:33.429
- Say good-bye Toto.
- Good-bye!

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:36.307
- Good-bye, Dorothy.
- Good-bye, everybody.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:38.181
Good-bye.

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:05.670
Auntie Em! Uncle Henry!

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:09.006
- Henry! She's over here!
- Yeah, there she is.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:11.710
Oh! Where on earth have you been?

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:17.014
I see you're almost packed.

01:22:17.015 --> 01:22:19.934
Dorothy, we've been
through this already.

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:22.979
Uncle Henry, Auntie Em,
there's something we can do.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.522
- What? There's what?
- Follow me!

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:26.566
- Dorothy, wait!
- Come on!

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:34.157
Hey! Where are you going?

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:37.368
Sign this. Can you write?
'Cause an "X" will do.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:38.912
Next!

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:40.872
Wait!

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:43.749
Oh, goody gumdrops, look who it is.

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:46.294
Everyone, please.
Don't listen to him.

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:48.546
These are our homes!

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:50.840
And nobody has the right
to take them away from us.

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:53.301
Au contraire, my puppet.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:57.013
This document gives me full
authority to do exactly that.

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:58.848
- Next!
- Has anybody even looked at this?

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:00.224
- Gimme...
- No.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:02.560
- Give... me... that.
- Yep, that's her.

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:03.603
Dorothy!

01:23:03.604 --> 01:23:06.603
Watch it.

01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:15.448
Someone get me out of here.
Would you stop it?

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:18.409
Look, look. Who is this guy?

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:20.703
- Hmm.
- Which one is he really?

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:23.123
Well, let's just see.

01:23:23.916 --> 01:23:25.541
- Get me out of here.
- Huh?

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:29.253
- Get me out of here!
- I'll get you outta here and right to jail.

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:34.967
- Let's go, joker.
- Please, you're making a horrible mistake.

01:23:34.968 --> 01:23:37.386
- Good riddance!
- You can tell that to the judge.

01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:39.430
Hey, what about him?

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.183
Where is he going? Get him.
Stop him! He's getting away!

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:44.727
This is all his fault.
He made me do this!

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:46.812
I was coerced.
I didn't want to!

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:03.329
I'm so proud of you.

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:06.158
