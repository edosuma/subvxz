00:09.958 --> 00:12.961
A cyber attack is no longer
a question of if, but when.

00:12.962 --> 00:14.429
Mr. Al Nasri, what I'm offering you...

00:14.430 --> 00:16.847
Salman, Salman, please.

00:16.848 --> 00:19.783
You are tenacious, my friend.

00:19.784 --> 00:22.919
I prefer to think of myself
as passionate about my work.

00:24.955 --> 00:27.224
I will make with you a bargain.

00:27.225 --> 00:29.860
You will consult Al Nasri Financial

00:29.861 --> 00:32.229
to strengthen our cyber defenses...

00:32.229 --> 00:34.098
if you can tell me why I'm bringing

00:34.099 --> 00:37.533
American fast casual
dining to the Kingdom.

00:39.603 --> 00:42.039
Because in five years,

00:42.040 --> 00:43.540
single women will drive
themselves to work,

00:43.541 --> 00:44.808
and there will be more movie screens

00:44.809 --> 00:46.744
in Jeddah than in Midtown Manhattan.

00:46.745 --> 00:48.646
Because you see the
new Saudi Arabia...

00:48.647 --> 00:52.349
government transparency,
education reform, trade.

00:52.350 --> 00:56.387
Honestly, my daughter just
loves their milkshakes.

00:56.388 --> 01:00.390
But I like what you said.

01:01.759 --> 01:03.359
Welcome to the new Saudi Arabia.

01:12.503 --> 01:17.975
Hey, you're missing some primo
huevos rancheros in here.

01:17.976 --> 01:19.710
Brain food.

01:19.711 --> 01:22.346
Eggs are brain food?

01:22.347 --> 01:24.248
Too bad we don't have a
National Merit Scholar

01:24.249 --> 01:25.549
to ask about that.

01:25.550 --> 01:26.650
- Please stop.
- Wait.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.485
Isn't our son a
National Merit Scholar?

01:28.486 --> 01:31.121
Well, wouldn't his school

01:31.122 --> 01:33.957
have some kind of formal
ceremony recognizing him

01:33.958 --> 01:35.659
as a National Merit Scholar?

01:35.660 --> 01:37.795
I did well on a standardized test.

01:37.796 --> 01:39.663
I didn't sequence the human genome.

01:39.664 --> 01:42.299
Oh, look, you're being celebrated

01:42.300 --> 01:44.802
for all your hard work,
and a $2,500 scholarship...

01:44.803 --> 01:47.004
thank you... that is
nothing to sneeze at.

01:47.005 --> 01:48.772
So, get over here and feed

01:48.773 --> 01:51.108
that National Merit Scholar brain.

01:51.109 --> 01:54.044
Oh, look, it's your new
best friend again.

01:54.045 --> 01:56.647
The bombing four months ago
that killed an American

01:56.648 --> 01:59.183
and many others is yet
another tragic consequence

01:59.184 --> 02:02.853
of Secretary McCord and
the Dalton administration

02:02.854 --> 02:05.089
aiding and abetting those
that would do us harm.

02:05.090 --> 02:07.624
Are you implying that the
Dalton administration

02:07.625 --> 02:09.493
- is negotiating...
- It's unbelievable.

02:09.494 --> 02:11.128
We invited this guy into our home.

02:11.129 --> 02:15.165
I like to think he remembers
that night fondly sometimes

02:15.166 --> 02:17.334
when he's sunning himself on a rock.

02:17.335 --> 02:19.036
Well, look, Trevor,

02:19.037 --> 02:24.208
who is Hezbollah's patron state?
It's Iran.

02:24.209 --> 02:27.578
Elizabeth McCord naively
trooped off to Tehran

02:27.579 --> 02:29.446
to negotiate a nuclear deal,

02:29.447 --> 02:33.083
and she gave away our
sanctions leverage.

02:33.084 --> 02:36.053
She promised us peace,
and look what we got.

02:36.054 --> 02:39.056
And now she's back with the so-called

02:39.057 --> 02:41.525
"Phase Two" of the negotiations.

02:41.526 --> 02:43.527
That's why I've introduced legislation

02:43.528 --> 02:45.696
to undo this disastrous Phase One,

02:45.697 --> 02:47.898
and to stop Phase Two in its tracks.

02:47.899 --> 02:50.300
That guy has one of the
most punchable faces

02:50.301 --> 02:52.269
- of all time.
- Well, yeah, but I mean,

02:52.270 --> 02:53.437
he kind of has a point.

02:53.438 --> 02:55.606
I mean, the bomb killed
a lot of people,

02:55.607 --> 02:57.541
and then the deal just
let billions of dollars

02:57.542 --> 02:58.709
flow into a hostile regime.

02:58.710 --> 03:00.277
I mean, what do...
what do we get in return?

03:00.278 --> 03:01.879
- Here we go.
- I'm just saying

03:01.880 --> 03:04.615
it seems like Phase One left a lot
of important issues unresolved.

03:04.616 --> 03:06.249
Well, that's because it did.

03:07.117 --> 03:08.952
By design.

03:08.953 --> 03:12.589
Okay, so Morejon's not entirely wrong.

03:12.590 --> 03:16.393
Iran was one month away

03:16.394 --> 03:19.396
from having a viable nuclear weapon.

03:19.397 --> 03:22.266
One month.

03:22.267 --> 03:25.035
That would have posed
an existential threat

03:25.036 --> 03:29.106
to Israel, Europe and,
ultimately, the United States.

03:29.107 --> 03:31.341
And the scale of the
war that it would've

03:31.342 --> 03:32.643
taken to prevent that...

03:32.644 --> 03:35.646
Well, let's just say
instead of college,

03:35.647 --> 03:40.150
right now, you might well be
thinking about the draft.

03:40.151 --> 03:42.052
That's what we got in return.

03:42.053 --> 03:43.821
So, you're welcome.

03:43.822 --> 03:45.756
The fact that these talks
are happening at all,

03:45.757 --> 03:47.491
kind of history-making.

03:47.492 --> 03:48.925
We'll see.

03:50.260 --> 03:52.962
What, you think they might not work?

03:53.964 --> 03:57.401
Iran is still prevented
from being fully integrated

03:57.402 --> 03:59.136
into the global banking system,

03:59.137 --> 04:01.705
stifling our economy
and costing billions

04:01.706 --> 04:03.173
of dollars a year.

04:03.174 --> 04:05.375
This must be addressed
first and foremost.

04:05.376 --> 04:06.777
And it could be, Minister Esfahani,

04:06.778 --> 04:10.380
if Iran is willing to facilitate
a lasting cease-fire in Yemen.

04:10.381 --> 04:12.472
- These people have had...
- It is your Saudi friends

04:12.473 --> 04:15.085
who are pulling the strings in
the ongoing Yemeni conflict.

04:15.086 --> 04:16.987
The shipload of anti-aircraft missiles

04:16.988 --> 04:18.522
in the Gulf of Aden,

04:18.523 --> 04:20.290
and the 200 pounds of C-4

04:20.291 --> 04:23.660
intercepted by the
Bahrani authorities?

04:23.661 --> 04:26.196
We all know your Quds Forces
directed those shipments.

04:26.197 --> 04:29.633
Minister, arming the rebels
in Yemen can only lead

04:29.634 --> 04:30.701
to more violence.

04:30.702 --> 04:32.936
If you want to de-escalate

04:32.937 --> 04:35.072
the situation in Yemen,

04:35.073 --> 04:38.208
then a public statement
from Saudi Arabia

04:38.209 --> 04:39.276
pledging to do just that

04:39.277 --> 04:42.746
would be viewed favorably in Tehran.

04:42.747 --> 04:46.149
Well, Minister,
the United States insists

04:46.150 --> 04:48.485
that Iran first respect
the sovereignty

04:48.486 --> 04:49.686
of its neighbors.

04:49.687 --> 04:52.656
I'm afraid the United States
lacks the credibility

04:52.657 --> 04:54.358
to lecture anyone

04:54.359 --> 04:56.827
on honoring a nation's sovereignty.

04:56.828 --> 05:00.196
Ask our neighbors, the Iraqis.

05:03.199 --> 05:05.402
Bess, we're thinking of
punting the Phase Two talks

05:05.403 --> 05:06.537
until after the midterms.

05:06.538 --> 05:07.704
Sir, we need to press on.

05:07.705 --> 05:10.741
Morejon, he-he's just grandstanding.

05:10.742 --> 05:12.776
Well, to hear the talking
heads on cable news

05:12.777 --> 05:15.279
tell it, we've got Iranian extremists

05:15.280 --> 05:17.748
implicated in the murder
of an American citizen

05:17.749 --> 05:20.484
while you're airlifting
billion-dollar gift baskets

05:20.485 --> 05:21.685
into Tehran.

05:21.686 --> 05:23.587
Our allies in Congress were
skittish to begin with.

05:23.588 --> 05:26.256
This doesn't help. I'm already
booked on Trevor Vance's show

05:26.257 --> 05:27.724
to get our side out there.

05:27.725 --> 05:29.259
Meanwhile, the Saudis... you remember,

05:29.260 --> 05:30.794
our allies, the Saudis...

05:30.795 --> 05:33.997
are all spun up over this
arms deal you're slow-rolling

05:33.998 --> 05:35.332
to placate Iran.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.167
The Saudis will get

05:37.168 --> 05:39.035
- their precision-guided missiles.
- When?

05:40.604 --> 05:42.506
Give me three more months.

05:42.507 --> 05:45.709
I'll tell them that-that
the deal is hung up

05:45.710 --> 05:47.144
with our lawyers

05:47.145 --> 05:49.780
at the Political-Military Affairs

05:49.781 --> 05:51.648
and the folks at DSCA.

05:51.649 --> 05:54.251
Which is actually semi-true.

05:54.252 --> 05:58.555
But besides, they will
get greater security

05:58.556 --> 06:00.791
if we are able to pull off

06:00.792 --> 06:02.720
- the Phase Two talks.
- Yeah, well, something tells me

06:02.721 --> 06:03.860
they won't see it that way.

06:03.861 --> 06:05.062
Morejon certainly won't.

06:05.063 --> 06:06.897
He's close to wrangling enough votes

06:06.898 --> 06:08.532
to scuttle any deal we make.

06:08.533 --> 06:13.170
Backing off till after the midterms...

06:13.171 --> 06:15.538
gives us room to maneuver.

06:17.441 --> 06:20.944
If we postpone the talks,
Iran will walk.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.547
And if they do, it all but guarantees

06:23.548 --> 06:26.049
they'll continue funding our enemies.

06:26.050 --> 06:29.186
- And how are the talks going?
- Slowly,

06:29.187 --> 06:30.654
sir.

06:30.655 --> 06:34.791
We are negotiating with a
long-time adversary, Russell,

06:34.792 --> 06:36.526
not microwaving soup... it takes time.

06:36.527 --> 06:38.729
Which I hope I'm making
clear is not on our side.

06:38.730 --> 06:41.098
What might speed up the process?

06:41.099 --> 06:45.602
Okay, my team has
flagged an inducement

06:45.603 --> 06:47.638
that we think could grab
the Iranians enough

06:47.639 --> 06:50.941
to force some real concessions.

06:50.942 --> 06:55.245
Access to SWIFT interbank
communications network.

06:55.246 --> 06:56.380
You want to just let them back

06:56.381 --> 06:57.714
into the international banking system?

06:57.715 --> 06:58.715
They are desperate

06:58.716 --> 07:01.418
to bring their economy
in from the cold.

07:01.419 --> 07:05.255
So this could allow us to
demand serious concessions

07:05.256 --> 07:07.523
in exchange.

07:09.726 --> 07:11.795
All right, Bess, but
you're on the clock here.

07:11.796 --> 07:13.730
- Yes.
- Longer this drags out,

07:13.731 --> 07:15.666
the better chance these talks get

07:15.667 --> 07:16.867
pulled down around our ears.

07:16.868 --> 07:19.369
Yes, sir. Thank you,
Mr. President, Russell.

07:19.370 --> 07:21.737
Yeah.

07:23.340 --> 07:26.009
So, I hear you've pared back

07:26.010 --> 07:30.180
some of your off-campus activities.

07:30.181 --> 07:32.482
More time for my students.

07:32.483 --> 07:33.850
Well, that is good news.

07:33.851 --> 07:37.688
Because one of your proposals
has gained some traction

07:37.689 --> 07:38.955
with the board.

07:38.956 --> 07:40.957
Oh, yeah? Which proposal is that?

07:40.958 --> 07:43.794
Some additional funding
has made launching

07:43.795 --> 07:45.729
a military ethics department

07:45.730 --> 07:47.264
a viable option.

07:47.265 --> 07:49.766
Well, that is great news.
I think it'll be

07:49.767 --> 07:51.468
an invaluable asset to our program.

07:51.469 --> 07:54.237
"Today's battle space
ranges from cyberspace

07:54.238 --> 07:55.472
"to outer space.

07:55.473 --> 07:58.141
"It is vital to give
tomorrow's commanders

07:58.142 --> 07:59.443
"the ethical tools they need

07:59.444 --> 08:03.680
to make sound decisions in
a rapidly changing world."

08:03.681 --> 08:05.182
That was some memo you wrote.

08:05.183 --> 08:06.183
Two years ago.

08:06.184 --> 08:08.452
Academia.

08:08.453 --> 08:10.821
Worse, government-funded academia.

08:10.822 --> 08:12.889
We'll need an interim chair.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.890
You're at the top of our list.

08:16.593 --> 08:20.030
Oh, I'm flattered you would
think of me, General,

08:20.031 --> 08:21.965
but I really am looking forward

08:21.966 --> 08:23.767
to getting back to teaching full time.

08:23.768 --> 08:25.368
Oh, I just assumed

08:25.369 --> 08:28.205
since it was your idea,
you'd want to lead the charge.

08:28.206 --> 08:32.442
A perfectly logical assumption.
Nevertheless, I...

08:32.443 --> 08:34.211
Give me a couple of
days to think about it.

08:34.212 --> 08:35.645
Absolutely.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.546
Thanks.

08:41.417 --> 08:42.652
Good news and bad news, ma'am.

08:42.653 --> 08:44.421
You know what? Let's be Zen

08:44.422 --> 08:47.557
- and call it all just news.
- Fair enough.

08:47.558 --> 08:49.826
Uh, neutral news item number one:

08:49.827 --> 08:52.195
the Iranians responded well
to the prospect of being

08:52.196 --> 08:55.499
reintroduced into the
SWIFT banking system.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.635
You think they'd be open to
cutting off financial support

08:58.636 --> 09:00.570
to their proxy forces, like Hezbollah?

09:00.571 --> 09:02.272
They didn't leave the
table when I broached it,

09:02.273 --> 09:04.007
so we'll call it a start.

09:04.008 --> 09:05.342
Okay, good work.

09:05.343 --> 09:07.444
- Ma'am.
- Um...

09:07.445 --> 09:11.181
So what's the, um,
you know, other news?

09:11.182 --> 09:12.783
Yeah, um, the Saudi
ambassador showed up

09:12.784 --> 09:15.519
without an appointment,
and he does not look happy.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.853
Well, I'll deal with that.

09:16.854 --> 09:18.421
You keep at it with the Iranians.

09:18.422 --> 09:19.456
Yes, ma'am.

09:19.457 --> 09:21.024
Madam Secretary.

09:21.025 --> 09:23.259
Prince Asim. Come on in.

09:24.361 --> 09:26.196
I needn't remind the United States

09:26.197 --> 09:27.497
of the importance of honoring

09:27.498 --> 09:29.432
its commitments to its
long-term partner.

09:29.433 --> 09:32.169
The United States has always valued

09:32.170 --> 09:34.404
its alliance with Saudi Arabia.

09:34.405 --> 09:36.239
And yet, you delay sending us

09:36.240 --> 09:39.576
essential defensive weapons,
all in an effort

09:39.577 --> 09:42.746
- to placate the Iranians.
- First of all, there's no delay.

09:42.747 --> 09:45.248
Our lawyers are simply
reviewing the contracts.

09:45.249 --> 09:47.717
They have to do that every
time we make an arms deal.

09:47.718 --> 09:50.153
Three more months have
mysteriously been added

09:50.154 --> 09:52.055
to the delivery timeline.

09:52.056 --> 09:53.190
How is that not a delay?

09:53.191 --> 09:56.367
I assure you we are not naive
to the threat Iran poses.

09:56.368 --> 09:58.595
If you do not give us
the weapons we need,

09:58.596 --> 10:01.164
then you are not only naive,
but complicit in that threat.

10:01.165 --> 10:03.667
You have the right to self-defense,

10:03.668 --> 10:05.769
but you have no right
to barge into my office

10:05.770 --> 10:08.605
and demand U.S.
precision-guided munitions

10:08.606 --> 10:11.140
on your timetable.

10:12.943 --> 10:15.912
During your misadventure in Iraq,

10:15.913 --> 10:18.315
it was Saudi Arabia
that opened its bases

10:18.316 --> 10:20.550
and airspace to you.

10:20.551 --> 10:22.519
Free of charge, no less.

10:22.520 --> 10:24.721
Perhaps you have forgotten
who your true friends are.

10:24.722 --> 10:27.457
I assure you, we have not.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.459
Excellent.

10:29.460 --> 10:30.594
His Majesty will be pleased

10:30.595 --> 10:32.062
to hear these delays
are being resolved,

10:32.063 --> 10:34.798
and the missiles will be
on their way very soon.

10:34.799 --> 10:37.333
Good day, Madam Secretary.

10:42.806 --> 10:44.241
Anyway, the moral of the story is

10:44.242 --> 10:46.676
you try to make peace
in the Middle East,

10:46.677 --> 10:49.846
everybody gets mad at you.

10:49.847 --> 10:52.349
At least one of us had a good day.

10:52.350 --> 10:54.484
Mm, to tell you the truth,

10:54.485 --> 10:56.553
I think I'm gonna pass on that job.

10:56.554 --> 10:57.988
Why?

10:57.989 --> 11:00.156
The ethics department was your idea.

11:00.157 --> 11:01.791
They literally got the memo.

11:01.792 --> 11:06.263
It's... dealing with staffing
assignments and budget requests.

11:06.264 --> 11:07.664
Uh...

11:07.665 --> 11:08.832
You remember

11:08.833 --> 11:11.201
how mind-numbing college
bureaucracy can be.

11:11.202 --> 11:12.802
Not to mention the petty politics.

11:12.803 --> 11:14.471
Faculty senate made the Middle East

11:14.472 --> 11:15.705
look like child's play.

11:15.706 --> 11:17.841
Exactly. So, just think

11:17.842 --> 11:20.710
I want to just focus on
teaching for a while,

11:20.711 --> 11:22.344
avoid the headaches.

11:23.113 --> 11:25.315
Is that the whole story?

11:25.316 --> 11:27.784
Well,

11:27.785 --> 11:30.787
maybe I'm feeling a little burnt
after my experience at CIA.

11:31.956 --> 11:33.023
I-I'm just not so hot

11:33.024 --> 11:34.724
to jump back into a
leadership position

11:34.725 --> 11:36.426
where you're getting
it from all sides.

11:36.427 --> 11:38.727
I have thoughts. Hold on.

11:42.699 --> 11:44.701
Yeah?

11:44.702 --> 11:47.704
Send him in.

11:47.705 --> 11:49.639
Mike B. is here.

11:52.776 --> 11:53.944
Hey, Mike.

11:53.945 --> 11:56.379
To what do we owe the
pleasure, or alarm?

11:56.380 --> 11:57.914
You want some tea, or something?

11:57.915 --> 11:59.049
Can't stay. Gordon's waiting.

11:59.050 --> 12:01.551
Listen, the news will
probably break tomorrow,

12:01.552 --> 12:03.420
but I wanted you to
hear it from me first.

12:03.421 --> 12:05.288
I got a tip from a source

12:05.289 --> 12:06.389
at the D.C. District Court.

12:06.390 --> 12:07.390
You're being sued.

12:07.391 --> 12:08.491
- What?
- By whom?

12:08.492 --> 12:09.592
The parents of Jim Dawson,

12:09.593 --> 12:11.594
the American killed in
the Riyadh bombing.

12:11.595 --> 12:13.763
They're suing you for the
wrongful death of their son.

12:13.764 --> 12:16.766
I'll-I'll call you tomorrow.

12:19.370 --> 12:26.496
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

12:30.512 --> 12:31.853
Basically, the suit claims

12:31.854 --> 12:33.422
that Elizabeth facilitated a deal

12:33.423 --> 12:35.490
which led to funds being
freed up to go to Iran.

12:35.491 --> 12:37.692
Those funds made their
way to Hezbollah,

12:37.693 --> 12:38.960
whose operative may have paid

12:38.961 --> 12:41.797
for the bombing that killed
Jim Dawson, which is,

12:41.798 --> 12:43.465
- on its merits...
- Absurd.

12:43.466 --> 12:45.066
The legal term is "spurious."

12:45.067 --> 12:47.702
But in any case, sovereign
immunity shields Elizabeth

12:47.703 --> 12:48.904
from legal liability.

12:48.905 --> 12:51.907
I can certainly understand
the family's anger,

12:51.908 --> 12:54.776
but if the suit is a nonstarter,

12:54.777 --> 12:57.245
what do they hope to gain by it?

12:57.246 --> 12:59.614
I can't imagine these people are
taking out a second mortgage

12:59.615 --> 13:01.983
to keep a $700 per
hour firm on retainer.

13:01.984 --> 13:03.285
Someone's behind this.

13:03.286 --> 13:04.686
So I'll put together a list

13:04.687 --> 13:06.321
of deep-pocket donors
with an axe to grind

13:06.322 --> 13:07.456
against the president.

13:07.457 --> 13:08.557
Long list.

13:08.558 --> 13:10.525
There's, uh...

13:10.526 --> 13:13.161
also the matter of what
Jim Dawson was doing

13:13.162 --> 13:14.596
in Saudi Arabia.

13:14.597 --> 13:17.799
Jim Dawson was a, uh,
cyber security consultant

13:17.800 --> 13:20.569
for a handful of companies
from Algiers to Abu Dhabi,

13:20.570 --> 13:23.705
and he was one of ours.

13:23.706 --> 13:25.507
Dawson was a spy?

13:25.508 --> 13:27.409
Yeah. Six years, Special Operations

13:27.410 --> 13:28.510
right out of high school.

13:28.511 --> 13:30.712
E.O.D. attached to a SEAL platoon.

13:30.713 --> 13:32.280
Spent the last eight at the agency

13:32.281 --> 13:34.616
infiltrating extremist money networks.

13:34.617 --> 13:35.817
So his cover was blown?

13:35.818 --> 13:37.953
Do we think this was an assassination?

13:37.954 --> 13:42.591
Yes, but, uh,
Dawson wasn't the target.

13:42.592 --> 13:44.493
Salman Al Nasri.

13:44.494 --> 13:46.428
He's an entrepreneur,
used his billions

13:46.429 --> 13:49.664
to fund a variety of
progressive initiatives.

13:49.665 --> 13:51.633
The attackers were ideologues

13:51.634 --> 13:54.069
motivated to strike at
the "decadent West."

13:54.070 --> 13:55.971
CIA thinks our man was just

13:55.972 --> 13:58.073
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

13:58.074 --> 14:00.275
Well, speaking of being in the
wrong place at the wrong time,

14:00.276 --> 14:04.479
Elizabeth... and I cannot stress
this enough... do not get served.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.314
And that is the sum total

14:06.315 --> 14:08.917
of your vaunted and
costly legal advice?

14:08.918 --> 14:10.652
Taking the summons,
plus the wrong judge,

14:10.653 --> 14:11.987
leaves you open to be deposed.

14:11.988 --> 14:13.221
A deposition means

14:13.222 --> 14:15.457
you go on record declining
to answer their questions

14:15.458 --> 14:18.193
on national security grounds,
so, yeah.

14:18.194 --> 14:19.861
Yeah, Morejon could spin your silence

14:19.862 --> 14:23.031
as putting the Iran deal over
the family of a dead American.

14:23.032 --> 14:25.100
Dead at the hands of
Iranian-backed terrorists.

14:25.101 --> 14:27.002
Yeah, which just adds
more fuel to his fire

14:27.003 --> 14:28.603
to kill your deal in Congress.

14:28.604 --> 14:31.573
So... if you don't
want that to happen...

14:31.574 --> 14:34.208
Don't get served.

14:35.877 --> 14:40.348
To be clear: we are sitting
in the White House,

14:40.349 --> 14:41.650
in front of the president,

14:41.651 --> 14:43.518
and you're telling
me to dodge the law.

14:43.519 --> 14:45.320
Now she's getting it.

14:50.725 --> 14:52.093
Oh, uh, I-I'm sorry. I can come back.

14:52.094 --> 14:54.361
Uh, no, stay. Please, come in.

14:55.130 --> 14:56.631
Auspicious timing.

14:56.632 --> 14:58.099
Have you met Lyle Belkin?

14:58.100 --> 14:59.968
He's one of our visiting professors.

14:59.969 --> 15:01.336
Well, good to meet you.

15:01.337 --> 15:03.071
I read your book on
Sherman's March to the Sea

15:03.072 --> 15:04.306
and the birth of total warfare.

15:04.307 --> 15:05.907
- Very nice work.
- Thank you.

15:05.908 --> 15:08.944
And you are the famous
Mr. Madam Secretary.

15:08.945 --> 15:12.681
That's one of the titles
that I proudly hold.

15:12.682 --> 15:14.683
I hope she's got her wicker shield.

15:14.684 --> 15:17.018
I'm not following you.

15:17.019 --> 15:20.622
Ancient Persian soldiers were
famous for their wicker shields,

15:20.623 --> 15:22.023
as I'm sure you know.

15:22.024 --> 15:23.658
The media seems to think

15:23.659 --> 15:25.560
she's fighting for the
Iranians now, it's...

15:25.561 --> 15:27.829
Sorry, bad joke.

15:27.830 --> 15:29.631
Is that what that was?

15:29.632 --> 15:31.499
Uh, Lyle was just

15:31.500 --> 15:35.337
expressing his interest in the
interim ethics department chair.

15:35.338 --> 15:38.373
He dropped in to share some
ideas about the curriculum.

15:38.374 --> 15:40.508
Well, then, it is auspicious timing,

15:40.509 --> 15:41.743
because I came by to say

15:41.744 --> 15:44.846
that I'm interested in the job myself.

15:44.847 --> 15:46.915
Oh.

15:46.916 --> 15:48.216
Well, that's excellent.

15:48.217 --> 15:51.519
You should both prepare
a short presentation

15:51.520 --> 15:53.388
with your vision for the department,

15:53.389 --> 15:57.125
and why you think you'd be
the best person for the job.

15:57.126 --> 15:59.361
I'll set up interviews with
the board immediately.

15:59.362 --> 16:00.695
Great.

16:00.696 --> 16:02.330
May the best man win.

16:02.331 --> 16:03.598
I'm looking forward to it.

16:03.599 --> 16:06.134
Lyle.

16:06.135 --> 16:09.137
The deal that we have in place now

16:09.138 --> 16:12.440
caps Iran's enrichment
at four percent,

16:12.441 --> 16:15.877
which is nowhere near the 90% level

16:15.878 --> 16:17.679
they would need to build a bomb.

16:17.680 --> 16:20.482
Americans are objectively safer,

16:20.483 --> 16:22.350
thanks to Phase One,

16:22.351 --> 16:25.720
and Phase Two will just
build on that good work.

16:25.721 --> 16:28.556
Now, I wonder if the family of
Jim Dawson would agree with you.

16:28.557 --> 16:30.492
Uh, can we roll that tape?

16:30.493 --> 16:34.462
We give these people money and
they use it to attack us?

16:34.463 --> 16:36.398
Uh...

16:36.399 --> 16:40.701
He was the best son
a father could w...

16:42.137 --> 16:45.573
I just don't understand.

16:45.574 --> 16:48.076
And what do you say to that
family who's lost their son?

16:48.077 --> 16:49.878
It's a terrible loss.

16:49.879 --> 16:52.647
My heart truly breaks
for the Dawson family.

16:52.648 --> 16:54.482
Well, Senator Carlos Morejon asks

16:54.483 --> 16:56.351
if this isn't the inevitable result

16:56.352 --> 16:58.653
of making deals with Iran.

16:58.654 --> 17:02.424
Isn't what you call "peace,"
really appeasement?

17:02.425 --> 17:05.627
Well, you know,
at the height of the Cold War,

17:05.627 --> 17:08.696
Ronald Reagan negotiated
the START treaty

17:08.698 --> 17:11.199
with the Soviet Union,
drastically reducing

17:11.200 --> 17:13.702
both nations' nuclear stockpiles.

17:13.703 --> 17:17.771
Now, if we could negotiate

17:17.772 --> 17:21.376
with the greatest adversary
this country has ever faced,

17:21.377 --> 17:23.611
at a moment of maximum peril,

17:23.612 --> 17:28.383
I think we can do the same with
a regional power like Iran.

17:28.384 --> 17:30.051
Forgive me if this is difficult,

17:30.052 --> 17:34.089
but some say you have lost
clarity when it comes to Iran,

17:34.090 --> 17:35.457
due to your own painful experiences.

17:35.458 --> 17:37.859
Who says that, exactly?

17:37.860 --> 17:40.128
Well, several sources.

17:40.129 --> 17:41.396
Well, you're implying

17:41.397 --> 17:44.265
that there's a chorus
of critics out there

17:44.266 --> 17:48.336
who are concerned about my
ability to reason clearly.

17:48.337 --> 17:49.738
Can you name one?

17:49.739 --> 17:52.873
Please, just answer
my question, ma'am.

17:55.710 --> 17:59.214
Actually, I would say that witnessing

17:59.215 --> 18:01.282
the horrors of terrorism firsthand

18:01.283 --> 18:03.051
gave me absolute clarity

18:03.052 --> 18:06.488
on the need to protect the
American people from it.

18:06.489 --> 18:09.724
I'm also absolutely clear

18:09.725 --> 18:12.827
that violence should
only be resorted to

18:12.828 --> 18:17.132
when every other option
has been exhausted.

18:17.133 --> 18:19.701
I wouldn't wish

18:19.702 --> 18:23.605
how I came to that clarity on anyone.

18:23.606 --> 18:27.642
Even those who treat
questions of war and peace

18:27.643 --> 18:30.812
as just another
Washington gotcha game.

18:30.813 --> 18:34.582
But thank you for
your concern, Trevor.

18:34.583 --> 18:37.619
Well, that is all the time we have.

18:37.620 --> 18:40.088
Well, I think it's safe to say

18:40.089 --> 18:43.258
that people heard the other
side of the argument.

18:43.259 --> 18:44.726
You okay, ma'am?

18:44.727 --> 18:46.194
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:46.195 --> 18:48.863
You don't really talk much
about your time in Iran.

18:48.864 --> 18:50.865
He wanted to go there.

18:50.866 --> 18:52.267
I went there.

18:52.268 --> 18:55.837
Yep. You sure did.

18:55.838 --> 18:57.771
- Elizabeth McCord?
- Sir, get back.

18:58.740 --> 18:59.629
Gun!

18:59.630 --> 19:00.630
- Whoa.
- What?

19:02.411 --> 19:03.511
Show me your hands!

19:03.512 --> 19:05.547
- Let me see them!
- I'm a process server.

19:05.548 --> 19:06.414
I'm a...

19:06.415 --> 19:08.483
process server.

19:08.484 --> 19:11.618
I'm a... process server.

19:12.387 --> 19:14.389
Bad news, ma'am.

19:14.390 --> 19:17.358
We're trying to rise above labels now,

19:17.359 --> 19:19.427
and calling it all just "news."

19:19.428 --> 19:20.562
Yeah, have fun with that.

19:20.563 --> 19:22.497
Gun!

19:22.498 --> 19:25.033
Someone from the crowd
recorded it on their cell.

19:25.034 --> 19:26.034
The cable shows

19:26.035 --> 19:27.769
- are playing it on loop.
- Ow.

19:27.770 --> 19:30.138
With the oh, so original
title "Tacklegate."

19:30.139 --> 19:33.908
You know, how about we
just retire "blankgate"

19:33.909 --> 19:35.510
as a construction altogether?

19:35.511 --> 19:37.278
- I'm sorry.
- So I'm guessing

19:37.279 --> 19:39.480
that no one's talking about
the secretary's appearance

19:39.481 --> 19:41.282
on Trevor Vance's show?

19:41.283 --> 19:43.418
No, because they're all
too busy watching me

19:43.419 --> 19:44.886
running away from the family of a man

19:44.887 --> 19:47.155
who was killed by
Iranian-backed terror.

19:47.156 --> 19:50.358
Which is exactly what POTUS
was afraid of, by the way.

19:50.359 --> 19:54.095
More, um, "news," ma'am:
uh, you're trending.

19:54.096 --> 19:56.497
#SecretaryOfEscape.

19:56.498 --> 19:58.600
Also, no more hashtags.

19:58.601 --> 20:01.502
I'll tell everyone.

20:01.503 --> 20:02.937
Let me see your hands!

20:02.938 --> 20:05.540
It looks a lot worse
than it really was.

20:05.541 --> 20:07.008
- I'm a process server.
- Right?

20:07.009 --> 20:09.277
Well, I hope so,
'cause it looks pretty bad.

20:10.379 --> 20:12.247
You're supposed to be on my side.

20:12.248 --> 20:14.916
Well, hey, what kind of
ethics professor would I be

20:14.917 --> 20:16.885
if I wasn't honest, right?

20:16.886 --> 20:18.553
I don't know.

20:18.554 --> 20:20.989
What kind of ethics
professor wants to be

20:20.990 --> 20:22.490
head of the ethics department

20:22.491 --> 20:25.026
just because some guy made
a crack about his wife?

20:25.027 --> 20:27.428
Hey, it's not that simple.

20:27.429 --> 20:31.165
Okay, it's not entirely that simple.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.234
I... just...

20:33.235 --> 20:35.003
Lyle rubs me the wrong way.

20:35.004 --> 20:36.371
But...

20:36.372 --> 20:37.538
Look, we have a real opportunity here

20:37.539 --> 20:39.507
to help future leaders learn

20:39.508 --> 20:42.877
how to deal with
enormously complex issues.

20:42.878 --> 20:45.513
I-I'm just not certain

20:45.514 --> 20:48.516
that Lyle is the right guy
to head the department.

20:48.517 --> 20:51.152
That you suggested they
create in the first place.

20:51.153 --> 20:52.754
Well, hey. Hey.

20:52.755 --> 20:54.188
What-what is your argument?

20:54.189 --> 20:55.623
Just that you said you wanted

20:55.624 --> 20:57.592
to spend more time in the classroom.

20:57.593 --> 20:59.627
You felt burned by the CIA.

20:59.628 --> 21:03.197
The point is, you wanted one thing,

21:03.198 --> 21:04.666
and then, this guy Lyle shows up,

21:04.667 --> 21:06.668
and now you want something different.

21:06.669 --> 21:10.605
I am perfectly happy
with whatever you pick.

21:10.606 --> 21:13.241
Just make sure that you are, too.

21:13.242 --> 21:14.143
Hey, Dad.

21:14.144 --> 21:15.243
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, Jace.

21:15.244 --> 21:17.245
Brutal takedown, by the way.

21:17.246 --> 21:18.913
Was it a thing, at school?

21:18.914 --> 21:21.182
It wasn't not a thing.

21:22.618 --> 21:25.987
I am sorry that my work drama

21:25.988 --> 21:27.622
impacts your life.

21:27.623 --> 21:29.223
It's... fine.

21:29.224 --> 21:31.859
But listen, if you can't make it
to my, like, my dumb ceremony

21:31.860 --> 21:34.028
'cause you're all wrapped
up in work, then it's

21:34.029 --> 21:35.863
totally fine because...

21:35.864 --> 21:39.300
Hey, do you remember the
last time you got an award

21:39.301 --> 21:41.602
at school? Because I do.

21:41.603 --> 21:44.105
Third grade, perfect attendance.

21:44.106 --> 21:46.307
And I didn't miss that one.

21:46.308 --> 21:48.343
Would've been too ironic,
for starters.

21:48.344 --> 21:51.579
And nothing is going to make me miss

21:51.580 --> 21:54.115
seeing my National Merit Scholar

21:54.116 --> 21:57.185
get his... medal? Certificate?

21:57.186 --> 21:58.586
Possibly both.

21:58.587 --> 22:01.189
Well, whatever it is, the point
is, she's gonna be there.

22:01.190 --> 22:04.092
Cheering from the crowd loudly.

22:04.093 --> 22:06.160
- Oh, God. I so regret excelling.
- Whoo!

22:06.161 --> 22:09.229
Aw.

22:11.399 --> 22:13.334
- Mr. President.
- Bess.

22:13.335 --> 22:15.636
The work you and your people
did to secure Phase One

22:15.637 --> 22:18.639
was laudable and crucial to
global security, but if Morejon

22:18.640 --> 22:20.608
gets the votes to kill Phase Two,

22:20.609 --> 22:23.144
he will put in language that
undoes the nuclear safeguards

22:23.145 --> 22:24.979
guaranteed in Phase One.

22:24.980 --> 22:26.981
That puts millions of lives at risk.

22:26.982 --> 22:28.082
I won't do it.

22:28.083 --> 22:29.417
We're pushing the Phase Two talks

22:29.418 --> 22:31.919
until after the midterms.

22:31.920 --> 22:36.090
Sir, this opportunity to cut
a meaningful security deal

22:36.091 --> 22:37.925
with Iran won't come again.

22:37.926 --> 22:40.895
Which means that sooner or later,

22:40.896 --> 22:42.730
we will be sucked into

22:42.731 --> 22:46.667
a Sunni-Shia war that will
engulf the entire Middle East.

22:46.668 --> 22:49.437
Either we make the deal
now, or no deal gets made.

22:49.438 --> 22:50.772
Then no deal gets made.

22:50.773 --> 22:53.608
It pains me, too, Bess.

22:53.609 --> 22:56.076
But we have to look at
the bigger picture.

23:00.348 --> 23:02.682
Understood, sir. Thank you.

23:08.515 --> 23:11.223
I hear you're something
of a bowman, General.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.258
You know, I've been
shooting Hoyt for years.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.161
Good weight, fast,
and almost no hand shock.

23:16.162 --> 23:19.097
Uh, the string angle on my
old Bear suits me better.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.599
Let me know when you're free.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.668
An old friend has a lease
out near Rockingham.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.904
Thanks to you and the
committee for your time, sir.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.206
It was our pleasure.
We'll be ready for you

23:28.207 --> 23:29.507
in just a moment, Henry.

23:29.508 --> 23:32.377
Thank you, General.

23:32.378 --> 23:35.080
You think I'm laying it on
a little heavy, don't you?

23:35.081 --> 23:37.482
Well, there's nothing wrong
with shared interests.

23:37.483 --> 23:38.884
An instructor back in Hamburg

23:38.885 --> 23:40.886
had a favorite Grant quote:

23:40.887 --> 23:43.355
"He who continues the attack, wins."

23:43.356 --> 23:45.123
You took the field officer course

23:45.124 --> 23:46.691
at the German Military Academy?

23:46.692 --> 23:49.361
Class of '93.

23:49.362 --> 23:52.030
Yeah, uh, made some buddies
over at Hahn Air Base.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.733
Oh, man. We used to have some times.

23:54.734 --> 23:58.203
Uh, how about that? Good for you.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.738
Professor McCord.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.138
Come on in.

24:14.653 --> 24:16.621
Oh, you got to be kidding.

24:16.622 --> 24:17.789
What's wrong?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.591
The...

24:19.592 --> 24:20.792
Oh.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.193
Ma'am, if you'll wait here a moment

24:22.194 --> 24:23.295
while we secure the entrance?

24:23.296 --> 24:26.131
No. No.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.465
No more dodging.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.601
- Babe.
- It's okay. I'll be fine.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.369
I'll meet you in there, okay?

24:31.370 --> 24:33.605
It's time to tackle this head-on,

24:33.606 --> 24:37.508
metaphorically speaking, Matt. Okay?

24:42.514 --> 24:44.749
No need to attack me.
I'm an officer of the court.

24:44.750 --> 24:48.386
No, no, I... Look, I-I want
to apologize for yesterday,

24:48.387 --> 24:50.488
and I hope you're not
in too much pain.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.791
Eh, this is nothing.

24:52.792 --> 24:55.327
One time, a meth dealer ran
over me with his Camaro.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.295
Oh, my God, that's awful.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.264
Besides, I should be thanking you.

24:59.265 --> 25:02.233
I'm confused.

25:02.234 --> 25:05.270
I linked the video of
your people tackling me

25:05.271 --> 25:07.471
to the website for my
legal services company.

25:07.917 --> 25:09.384
My business doubled overnight.

25:09.385 --> 25:13.054
- Oh... Well, good for you.
- That's...

25:13.055 --> 25:14.389
I'm Elizabeth.

25:14.390 --> 25:17.625
- Joel.
- Joel.

25:17.626 --> 25:19.994
So should we do this thing?

25:19.995 --> 25:21.663
Oh, yeah, right.

25:21.664 --> 25:24.261
Elizabeth McCord,
you have been served.

25:24.262 --> 25:26.330
Thanks, Joel.

25:26.331 --> 25:28.765
You have a good one.

25:29.241 --> 25:31.354
Just want you to know that your mom

25:31.355 --> 25:32.719
is very proud of you.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.054
Yeah, I think the whole
auditorium knew that.

25:36.223 --> 25:38.925
Alison, how's the Stu... uh, Mike?

25:38.926 --> 25:41.028
How did you, uh...

25:41.029 --> 25:42.996
The middle one let me in.
Damn it. I pressed the thing.

25:42.997 --> 25:46.399
Mike B. is here.
Congratulations on your award.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.970
So nice of you to stop by.

25:49.971 --> 25:51.305
Again.

25:51.306 --> 25:53.640
Hey, Mike. Guess this isn't
a social visit again.

25:53.641 --> 25:56.109
Can we talk in there?

25:56.110 --> 25:57.343
Yeah.

25:58.278 --> 26:01.515
I know. I know.
I let myself get served. Sorry.

26:01.516 --> 26:03.884
Yesterday's news.

26:03.885 --> 26:05.118
I found out who's covering

26:05.119 --> 26:06.687
the Dawsons' considerable legal fees.

26:06.688 --> 26:07.954
Yeah? Who is it?

26:07.955 --> 26:09.389
You're not gonna like the answer.

26:09.390 --> 26:12.192
I traced the money through a
series of offshore companies

26:12.193 --> 26:14.361
and subcontractors,
all the way back to its source,

26:14.362 --> 26:16.263
and arrived at a trust

26:16.264 --> 26:18.899
controlled by a powerful Saudi family

26:18.900 --> 26:21.168
with close ties to the government.

26:21.169 --> 26:22.336
You're kidding.

26:22.337 --> 26:23.670
I told you you wouldn't like it.

26:23.671 --> 26:26.473
Do you have hard proof
it was the Saudis?

26:26.474 --> 26:29.375
Not like a sworn affidavit,
but give me time.

26:32.145 --> 26:35.482
A purported ally sabotaging the
American Secretary of State.

26:35.483 --> 26:37.451
It's... unbelievable.

26:37.452 --> 26:41.086
What's a little backstabbing
among friends, right?

26:43.924 --> 26:46.083
Let me call you back.

26:46.084 --> 26:49.507
Madam Secretary, what
a pleasant surprise.

26:49.508 --> 26:52.235
You're being played by the Saudis.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.236
Excuse me?

26:53.237 --> 26:56.906
Someone very powerful in Saudi Arabia

26:56.907 --> 26:59.309
is paying the law firm

26:59.310 --> 27:01.311
- representing the Dawsons.
- That's ridiculous.

27:01.312 --> 27:05.348
It is. It also happens to be true.

27:05.349 --> 27:08.251
They're trying to
derail the Iran talks,

27:08.252 --> 27:10.286
and they are using you

27:10.287 --> 27:14.356
and our legislative process to
do the dirty work for them.

27:17.327 --> 27:21.297
But you already knew that,
Senator, didn't you?

27:21.298 --> 27:22.732
Well, you know the old proverb:

27:22.733 --> 27:26.436
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

27:26.437 --> 27:28.137
Well, that's interesting
that you think

27:28.138 --> 27:30.773
of the Secretary of
State as your enemy.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.042
More interesting still
that you assumed

27:33.043 --> 27:35.078
I meant you and not Iran.

27:35.079 --> 27:38.815
You stood in my house and talked about

27:38.816 --> 27:42.919
preserving American
sovereignty and safety.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.354
What happened to that guy?

27:44.355 --> 27:47.056
Don't you lecture me about patriotism.

27:47.057 --> 27:47.956
Oh.

27:47.957 --> 27:50.560
Saudi Arabia may not be
perfect, but they're our ally.

27:50.561 --> 27:55.031
I know exactly what I'm fighting
for, Madam Secretary. Do you?

27:55.032 --> 27:59.968
And who I'm fighting against.
See you around, Carlos.

28:06.279 --> 28:07.814
That Morejon.

28:07.815 --> 28:11.433
Every time I think that
guy might be all right,

28:11.434 --> 28:14.564
he pulls some opportunistic,

28:14.565 --> 28:16.599
weaselly maneuver.

28:16.600 --> 28:21.170
It's like: patriot, weasel,
patriot, weasel.

28:21.171 --> 28:24.073
No, I think it's more like:
weasel, weasel, briefly patriot,

28:24.074 --> 28:25.808
weasel, weasel, weasel, weasel.

28:25.809 --> 28:27.343
You're probably right.

28:27.344 --> 28:31.681
Anyway, you never told me the
details on your presentation.

28:31.682 --> 28:33.149
How'd it go?

28:33.150 --> 28:37.019
Well, like I said, it was okay.
It's Lyle that's the problem.

28:37.020 --> 28:38.854
What do you mean?

28:38.855 --> 28:40.523
Well, there's this
officer training course

28:40.524 --> 28:41.891
that's offered by the German military.

28:41.892 --> 28:43.693
It's very prestigious.

28:43.694 --> 28:45.494
Lyle said he took it in 1993

28:45.495 --> 28:47.863
and hung out with some
officers at Hahn Air Base

28:47.864 --> 28:49.098
during that time.

28:49.099 --> 28:51.801
It was an oddly specific detail.

28:51.802 --> 28:54.704
I-It bumped me, the way he said it.

28:54.705 --> 28:56.405
So I did a little digging.

28:56.406 --> 28:59.175
Turns out there's no record of Lyle

28:59.176 --> 29:01.978
graduating and finishing his
coursework at the academy.

29:01.979 --> 29:06.315
A-And yet he puts it
on his official CV.

29:06.316 --> 29:09.552
- Wow.
- Yeah.

29:09.553 --> 29:10.985
Wow.

29:12.955 --> 29:15.591
So are you gonna turn him in?

29:15.592 --> 29:18.027
I don't know.

29:18.028 --> 29:21.330
Exposing him is not a small thing.

29:21.331 --> 29:25.201
But integrity's kind
of the point, right?

29:25.202 --> 29:28.504
Yeah, but from the start,
I've had it in for the guy.

29:29.740 --> 29:33.175
There's something about
him that just bothers me.

29:33.176 --> 29:36.879
Yeah, I feel that way about,
like, everyone right now.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.749
Except you.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.917
Listen, I got to, I got to get back,

29:41.918 --> 29:45.254
but you just...

29:45.255 --> 29:47.323
do what you think is right.

29:47.324 --> 29:49.657
Okay.

29:52.728 --> 29:54.596
Right.

29:57.033 --> 29:58.601
Were you aware that Hezbollah

29:58.602 --> 30:00.936
was laundering money to
avoid U.S. sanctions?

30:00.937 --> 30:02.972
In accordance with my position

30:02.973 --> 30:05.841
as an executive officer
of the United States,

30:05.842 --> 30:07.943
I invoke executive privilege

30:07.944 --> 30:10.346
and refrain from
answering any questions

30:10.347 --> 30:12.848
that pertain to my
official duties as such.

30:12.849 --> 30:14.684
Were you aware that the
release of money frozen

30:14.685 --> 30:16.319
as a part of the
sanctions against Iran

30:16.320 --> 30:18.421
could be directed to
known terrorist groups?

30:18.422 --> 30:21.457
In accordance with my position

30:21.458 --> 30:24.493
as an executive officer
of the United States,

30:24.494 --> 30:27.963
I invoke executive pr...

30:27.964 --> 30:30.433
It's a rote answer. I got it.

30:30.434 --> 30:32.101
Do we really need to keep doing this?

30:32.102 --> 30:33.569
After the fiasco with
the process server?

30:33.570 --> 30:34.870
Yes, you definitely need to practice

30:34.871 --> 30:37.006
staying on script.

30:37.007 --> 30:38.374
Fine, go ahead.

30:38.375 --> 30:40.810
Okay. Did you...
You know what I can't stand?

30:40.811 --> 30:42.178
Betrayal by an ally.

30:42.179 --> 30:43.979
The capriciousness
of our legal system.

30:43.980 --> 30:45.548
People with pet ferrets.
It doesn't matter.

30:45.549 --> 30:46.716
This is where we are.

30:46.717 --> 30:49.785
Jim Dawson's family
lost their only son.

30:49.786 --> 30:53.354
And they have no idea
what really happened.

30:55.024 --> 30:58.761
You're right, and that's sad.

30:58.762 --> 31:01.330
But it's not our problem.
Let's get back to work, okay?

31:01.331 --> 31:04.266
But, see, it is my problem.

31:04.267 --> 31:07.403
The deal is dead.

31:07.404 --> 31:11.340
This lawsuit is whatever it is.

31:11.341 --> 31:13.876
But that family doesn't
deserve to be...

31:13.877 --> 31:15.911
manipulated by people

31:15.912 --> 31:17.446
hiding in the shadows.

31:17.447 --> 31:19.382
They are not going to
get their son back,

31:19.383 --> 31:21.050
but they deserve some peace.

31:21.051 --> 31:24.285
They deserve the truth.
I owe them that.

31:26.655 --> 31:28.122
Feel better?

31:29.125 --> 31:30.292
Yeah.

31:30.293 --> 31:32.027
Good, 'cause you're never
saying any of that.

31:32.028 --> 31:35.396
Actually, I think I am.

31:36.932 --> 31:39.968
- I'm still billing you for this.
- Yep.

31:50.079 --> 31:53.516
Mr. Dawson. Elizabeth McCord.

31:53.517 --> 31:57.086
I-I apologize for showing
up at your door like this,

31:57.087 --> 31:59.688
but I have some information
about your son.

31:59.689 --> 32:01.824
I think we ought to call our lawyer.

32:01.825 --> 32:04.026
Who is it, Bob?

32:04.027 --> 32:07.496
Hello, Mrs. Dawson. Grace.

32:07.497 --> 32:11.434
She says she's got
information about Jim.

32:11.435 --> 32:13.002
Can I...

32:13.003 --> 32:14.470
Please.

32:14.471 --> 32:16.571
Come in, Madam Secretary.

32:22.678 --> 32:24.680
This doesn't happen often,

32:24.681 --> 32:28.017
but the president has
approved the release

32:28.018 --> 32:30.019
of certain classified information

32:30.020 --> 32:32.588
about your son's death.

32:32.589 --> 32:34.557
I don't understand.

32:34.558 --> 32:37.393
Jim helped companies
with their computers.

32:37.394 --> 32:39.528
Mrs. Dawson,

32:39.529 --> 32:42.932
Jim was a decorated
operative for the CIA

32:42.933 --> 32:46.769
working on extremely sensitive
national security issues.

32:46.770 --> 32:50.705
He never said anything
about any of this.

32:53.809 --> 32:56.812
I know it's a lot to take in.

32:56.813 --> 33:01.984
He had to hide that side
of his life to protect you

33:01.985 --> 33:04.085
and families like yours.

33:07.890 --> 33:10.993
Jim was a hero who died in
service to this country.

33:10.994 --> 33:15.129
I know it doesn't bring your son back.

33:19.134 --> 33:20.769
You want us to drop the lawsuit.

33:20.770 --> 33:22.538
- Don't you?
- Sweetheart.

33:22.539 --> 33:25.341
No. No, honey, no. She's using us.

33:25.342 --> 33:27.710
Can't you see that? You
politicians are all the same.

33:27.711 --> 33:30.246
You only pretend you care when
there's something you need.

33:30.247 --> 33:33.748
Mr. Dawson, I agree with you.

33:34.917 --> 33:36.852
Politics can be an ugly business

33:36.853 --> 33:41.924
and if you want to sue me,
absolutely, that is your right.

33:41.925 --> 33:44.560
It's true.

33:44.561 --> 33:48.162
I shake a lot of hands
I'd rather not shake.

33:49.865 --> 33:54.904
But the unique privilege of my job...

33:54.905 --> 33:56.972
is that I get to see the difference

33:56.973 --> 33:58.340
that people like your son

33:58.341 --> 34:00.608
make in the world.

34:05.381 --> 34:09.918
On behalf of a grateful nation,

34:09.920 --> 34:12.121
I want to thank you for Jim's service

34:12.121 --> 34:14.223
and offer my deepest condolences.

34:14.224 --> 34:17.058
I appreciate your time.

34:18.726 --> 34:23.598
Thank you for telling
us about our Jim.

34:32.458 --> 34:33.460
How'd you do it?

34:33.460 --> 34:35.094
Do you want to just get it over with

34:35.096 --> 34:37.797
and move into our garage?

34:37.799 --> 34:39.933
When did you start
running voluntarily?

34:39.934 --> 34:41.368
Today.

34:41.369 --> 34:42.735
As you know, I've always maintained

34:42.737 --> 34:44.204
that exercise is stupid and painful,

34:44.205 --> 34:46.255
but clearly I know nothing

34:46.255 --> 34:48.790
because the Dawsons are
dropping the suit.

34:48.791 --> 34:50.559
So again, how did you do it?

34:50.560 --> 34:52.694
That's not what I went over there for,

34:52.695 --> 34:54.295
but that's good news, I suppose.

34:54.297 --> 34:55.697
You suppose?

34:55.697 --> 34:57.332
It's unequivocally good news.

34:57.333 --> 34:59.801
In fact, they're releasing
a statement thanking you

34:59.802 --> 35:01.003
for whatever it is you did.

35:01.004 --> 35:03.205
The word on the Hill is
Morejon is still trying

35:03.206 --> 35:04.840
to cobble together votes,
which he won't get

35:04.841 --> 35:06.975
once it leaks that the former

35:06.976 --> 35:09.311
Saudi deputy minister
of education is paying

35:09.312 --> 35:10.879
to manipulate a grieving,
American family.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.147
You found hard evidence?

35:12.148 --> 35:14.816
Sometimes it's like you
don't even realize

35:14.817 --> 35:16.051
you're insulting me.

35:17.554 --> 35:19.154
Anyway, the point is,

35:19.155 --> 35:21.557
you can now restart your
little peace talks.

35:21.558 --> 35:22.724
You're welcome.

35:22.725 --> 35:26.128
About that, um, is there
a friend rate or...?

35:26.129 --> 35:28.330
There is not.

35:28.331 --> 35:32.167
You, Elizabeth McCord,
are an exhausting client.

35:32.168 --> 35:34.436
Yeah.

35:34.437 --> 35:38.139
Going to see that family
was reckless and stupid.

35:41.009 --> 35:43.679
You know, you asked me how I did it.

35:43.680 --> 35:47.082
I wasn't trying to do anything,

35:47.083 --> 35:49.384
just what I thought was right.

35:49.385 --> 35:52.321
I already said. Stupid.

35:52.322 --> 35:54.588
Ugh.

35:58.026 --> 36:01.495
- Hey. Out.
- Hmm? Oh, yeah.

36:08.236 --> 36:10.205
Lyle. Hey.

36:10.206 --> 36:11.640
We need to talk.

36:11.641 --> 36:12.841
In a bit of a hurry.

36:12.842 --> 36:15.143
General Winfield has
some pictures of antlers

36:15.144 --> 36:16.089
he wants to show me.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.082
Look, I know you didn't complete

36:17.083 --> 36:20.618
the Military Academy of
the German Armed Forces.

36:20.619 --> 36:22.386
Their records show that you enrolled,

36:22.387 --> 36:24.955
but you didn't complete
your coursework.

36:26.624 --> 36:30.294
And you're gonna do what
with this allegation?

36:30.295 --> 36:33.431
Have this conversation with you.

36:33.432 --> 36:37.802
So I'll just step aside
and you can get the job.

36:37.803 --> 36:39.936
- Is that it?
- Or you could consider it an

36:39.937 --> 36:42.473
opportunity to correct your oversight.

36:42.474 --> 36:45.143
And no one has to know?

36:45.144 --> 36:46.544
Not if you resolve the issue.

36:46.545 --> 36:48.044
I don't see why they would.

36:51.683 --> 36:53.883
One point.

36:56.154 --> 37:00.458
I failed my last final by one point.

37:00.459 --> 37:02.493
I mean, there's a
retest the next week,

37:02.494 --> 37:06.097
but I'd already booked my
flight back to the States.

37:06.098 --> 37:08.499
Then one day I looked up.

37:08.500 --> 37:12.937
It was five years later and
no one had even mentioned it.

37:12.938 --> 37:15.306
Oh, man.

37:15.307 --> 37:16.841
That's tough.

37:16.842 --> 37:18.943
I'm sure a lot of us
would probably have done

37:18.944 --> 37:22.079
the exact same thing.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.315
Why are you doing this?

37:24.316 --> 37:27.485
I got the distinct impression
you didn't like me.

37:27.486 --> 37:28.819
I don't.

37:28.820 --> 37:30.721
Well, I didn't.

37:30.722 --> 37:33.791
I can come on strong, I know.

37:33.792 --> 37:36.727
That crack about your wife...

37:36.728 --> 37:38.528
Was not great.

37:40.131 --> 37:43.134
But your book about
Sherman's March was.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.535
You didn't have to do this, Lyle.

37:44.536 --> 37:45.636
You're the real deal.

37:45.637 --> 37:49.507
Even if not everything on your CV was.

37:49.508 --> 37:52.710
That's very decent of you.

37:52.711 --> 37:57.314
- Ethical, dare I say.
- Hmm.

37:58.482 --> 38:01.151
Thank you, Henry.

38:05.140 --> 38:06.104
Madam Secretary.

38:06.105 --> 38:09.206
I've heard a troubling rumor
about the late James Dawson,

38:09.207 --> 38:11.075
specifically in regards

38:11.076 --> 38:13.110
to who he was really working
for while in the Kingdom.

38:13.111 --> 38:15.346
Prince Asim, thanks so
much for making the time.

38:15.347 --> 38:17.715
Sending unauthorized
spies into our country

38:17.716 --> 38:21.685
is yet another example of the
U.S. abusing a trusted ally.

38:21.686 --> 38:25.889
We both know that every
country does exactly that

38:25.890 --> 38:29.526
to every other country, so you
feigning outrage tells me

38:29.527 --> 38:32.563
you really must be
getting hounded at home

38:32.564 --> 38:34.999
about closing this missile deal, huh?

38:35.000 --> 38:38.268
So we're being brutally
honest with each other now?

38:38.269 --> 38:40.304
What are trusted allies for, right?

38:40.305 --> 38:42.840
And in that spirit,

38:42.841 --> 38:46.844
we know that someone closely
connected with your government

38:46.845 --> 38:51.881
has been funding the
Dawsons' lawsuit against me.

38:53.584 --> 38:56.186
Madam Secretary, you misunderstand.

38:56.187 --> 38:58.222
His Highness remains
cognizant of the need

38:58.223 --> 39:00.090
for our continued cooperation.

39:00.091 --> 39:03.594
You mean you still want our
precision-guided weapons.

39:03.595 --> 39:05.562
Yeah, don't worry.
You-you'll get them...

39:05.563 --> 39:07.698
as soon as your government brokers

39:07.699 --> 39:09.732
an immediate cease-fire in Yemen.

39:11.235 --> 39:12.703
You must know that such a message

39:12.704 --> 39:15.494
will cause great consternation
to His Majesty.

39:15.495 --> 39:16.533
Hmm.

39:16.534 --> 39:18.342
And therefore, even
more to the messenger.

39:18.343 --> 39:21.645
I'm putting you in a rough spot.

39:21.646 --> 39:23.847
I know.

39:23.848 --> 39:26.450
But, truth be told,

39:26.451 --> 39:30.320
I haven't really been in a great
spot, either, the last few days,

39:30.321 --> 39:32.990
so cease-fire for missiles.

39:32.991 --> 39:34.924
That's the deal.

39:39.196 --> 39:41.331
I will take up your
proposal with the king.

39:41.332 --> 39:43.634
And I look forward to the
announcement of the cease-fire.

39:43.635 --> 39:45.568
Thanks so much. You have a great day.

39:50.574 --> 39:54.343
Welcome to the first meeting of
the Military Ethics Department.

39:55.979 --> 39:59.249
Okay, well, obviously, we're
just getting up and running,

39:59.250 --> 40:02.486
so I wanted to open the floor
and get a sense of your hopes

40:02.487 --> 40:03.721
for the new department.

40:03.722 --> 40:05.489
Well, first of all, congratulations.

40:05.490 --> 40:06.890
So well deserved.

40:06.891 --> 40:09.660
If I could just raise a
small housekeeping issue?

40:09.661 --> 40:10.794
Sure. Absolutely.

40:10.795 --> 40:14.264
I understand Lyle Belkin
has taken a sabbatical.

40:14.265 --> 40:16.700
I'm assuming that means
his parking space

40:16.701 --> 40:18.368
will be available.

40:18.369 --> 40:19.803
His parking space?

40:19.804 --> 40:21.705
Um, point of order.

40:21.706 --> 40:24.074
I made a request to
Facilities months ago

40:24.075 --> 40:26.043
for a closer spot, so...

40:26.044 --> 40:27.678
O-Okay. Okay.

40:27.679 --> 40:29.413
Well, I was hoping to talk about

40:29.414 --> 40:31.381
some bigger-picture
issues this morning.

40:31.382 --> 40:34.017
Of course. Of course.

40:34.018 --> 40:36.386
So you'll be taking it yourself then?

40:36.387 --> 40:38.322
To the victor go the spoils.

40:38.323 --> 40:40.491
All hail Henricus Rex.

40:40.492 --> 40:42.359
No.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.527
Okay, can we circle back

40:43.528 --> 40:45.763
to the parking space issue later?

40:45.764 --> 40:47.931
Yeah? Okay.

40:47.932 --> 40:49.299
"Iran commits to financial

40:49.300 --> 40:51.335
"transparency and accountability,

40:51.336 --> 40:53.704
"greater monitoring and transparency

40:53.705 --> 40:57.074
of Iranian weapon transfers
to non-State actors."

40:57.075 --> 41:02.279
And to insure this, Iran
will accept an inspection

41:02.280 --> 41:05.249
and verification regime.

41:05.250 --> 41:07.284
Is that acceptable?

41:07.285 --> 41:09.953
It is debatable.

41:09.954 --> 41:11.922
It's a start.

41:11.923 --> 41:14.358
Okay.

41:14.359 --> 41:17.828
In the spirit of cooperation,

41:17.829 --> 41:19.329
the IRGC has information

41:19.330 --> 41:21.799
on the whereabouts of
one of your citizens

41:21.800 --> 41:24.233
that it would like to share.

41:29.139 --> 41:30.507
Amina Shaloubi

41:30.508 --> 41:32.342
of the Washington Chronicle?
She was abducted

41:32.343 --> 41:34.044
by Boko Haram over a year ago.

41:34.045 --> 41:37.748
Your intelligence services
will find the information

41:37.749 --> 41:41.651
regarding Ms. Shaloubi's
location reliable.

41:43.921 --> 41:46.089
The United States appreciates
Iran's assistance

41:46.090 --> 41:48.725
in this matter.

41:48.726 --> 41:52.763
Gentlemen, I'm glad you're back.
