[ Judge ] Mr. Pearson,
do you have any additional
questions of this juror?

02:39.734 --> 02:42.437
Uh, I have a few questions,

any health problems connected
with cigarette smoking?

02:54.784 --> 02:59.489

Well, my father had emphysema.

And my sister had a baby
with birth defects.

03:01.892 --> 03:04.528
<i>Two of my uncles</i>

'cause her veins shriveled up.

03:07.398 --> 03:10.267
And the doctors say it was
all caused by smoking tobacco.

03:10.334 --> 03:14.138
And you believe
you could be impartial
on a case about cigarettes?

03:14.205 --> 03:16.373
I believe I could.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.943
- This is nuts!
- I don't think so.

Look, we can't match experts
with the tobacco industry.

If we parade up scientists
on addiction or dopamine
or whatever, we lose,

03:25.049 --> 03:27.185

they got bigger ones.

03:27.252 --> 03:29.254
So how does putting up
nobody help us?

Given the fact that
she didn't go to the police...

05:04.888 --> 05:07.490
and she accepted money
in exchange for her silence,

05:07.557 --> 05:09.459
I got some
reliability problems.

That reliability can be

05:15.032 --> 05:17.668
Moreover, the probative value
of her testimony...

05:17.735 --> 05:20.871
is grossly outweighed
by the prejudicial impact.

05:20.938 --> 05:23.908

and says that the defendant
tried to kill her,

05:23.975 --> 05:27.746

not let the jury hear this?

<i>already met.</i>

We will be setting out to prove
that cigarettes manufactured
by the defendant, T.L. Michaels,

caused Mr. Ray's wife, Margaret,
to develop lung cancer
and vascular disease,

20:09.175 --> 20:12.712
which then caused
her death in 1994.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.586
I was instructed
not to do that--
to drink water.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.022
Mr. Donnell told me
since none of you have water,

20:22.089 --> 20:24.191
<i>it's possible you could</i>
<i>resent me for having it.</i>

not to drink it.

my mouth went dry.
Sorry.

20:36.837 --> 20:40.141
The opening statement,
as you know, is not evidence.

20:40.208 --> 20:44.445

a preview of the evidence
we intend to show you.

product liability cases can
potentially drag on forever.

21:00.830 --> 21:03.966

corroded by the carcinogens
of cigarettes.

21:59.425 --> 22:01.293
And you will
believe Dr. Clark...

22:01.360 --> 22:04.730
because he's the only
doctor who actually
treated Margaret Ray.

22:06.399 --> 22:09.702
As for whether cigarettes
cause lung cancer,

22:09.768 --> 22:12.238
we will not be calling witnesses
to prove that either.

22:12.305 --> 22:17.744
We will show you what's printed
on the cigarette packages
themselves.

22:17.811 --> 22:20.914
"Smoking causes lung cancer.

22:20.980 --> 22:23.617
Cigarette smoke contains
carbon monoxide."

22:23.683 --> 22:26.453
These are the warnings
of the surgeon general.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.223
"Smoking causes lung cancer."

22:29.289 --> 22:34.294
We will present evidence that
cigarette companies manipulate
the levels of nicotine.

22:34.361 --> 22:38.566
We will be presenting evidence
of a two-year investigation
conducted by the F.D.A.,

22:38.633 --> 22:40.768
in which it found
nicotine to be addictive.

22:40.835 --> 22:44.472
So much, in fact,
that the F.D.A.
now regulates cigarettes...

22:44.539 --> 22:47.408
as drug delivery devices.

22:47.475 --> 22:50.078
But this trial is not
about whether cigarettes
are addictive.

22:50.145 --> 22:53.214
<i>So we won't be calling</i>
<i>witnesses to prove</i>
<i>that proposition.</i>

22:53.281 --> 22:55.150
Addictive or not,

22:55.216 --> 22:58.119
we're not gonna stand before you
and declare Margaret Ray...

22:58.186 --> 23:01.057
was a helpless victim
who had no choice but to smoke.

23:02.324 --> 23:04.961
We won't be saying
she was blameless.

23:05.027 --> 23:07.063
In fact, maybe she's
a lot to blame.

23:07.129 --> 23:09.498
T.L. Michaels didn't
force her to smoke.

23:09.565 --> 23:13.169
We're not even arguing that
cigarettes should be banned.
We live in a free society.

23:13.235 --> 23:16.639
That's one of the things
we're proud of in this country.
Now, it's a slippery slope...

23:16.706 --> 23:22.045
once you start arguing that
people shouldn't have the right
to make personal choices.

23:22.112 --> 23:26.649
And Margaret Ray chose
to smoke cigarettes.
Make no mistake.

23:26.717 --> 23:29.687
She bears responsibility.
Of course she does.

23:30.754 --> 23:34.458
All we're saying is
so does the defendant.

23:34.525 --> 23:36.894
Not all of it.
But some of it.

23:36.960 --> 23:41.732
You see, unlike automobiles
or alcohol or even guns,

23:41.799 --> 23:46.170
this is a product,
even when you use it carefully,

23:46.237 --> 23:48.106
it can still kill you.

23:48.172 --> 23:53.111
They put out a product,
when used as directed,
causes cancer.

23:55.079 --> 23:57.082
It's the plaintiff's
contention...

23:57.149 --> 23:59.584
that when their product
does kill somebody,

23:59.651 --> 24:02.387
they should bear
some responsibility.

24:02.454 --> 24:05.124
Just a little.

24:09.362 --> 24:11.130
Sorry.
I was doing pretty well.

24:12.765 --> 24:17.737
We will only be putting on
three, maybe four witnesses.

24:17.803 --> 24:21.274
Unless they're cross-examined
in perpetuity, we expect
to rest our case by Friday.

24:23.810 --> 24:28.949
It's possible the defendant
will put up 60 witnesses.

24:29.015 --> 24:32.052
That's how many
are on their list.

24:32.119 --> 24:34.255
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>or really care.</i>

24:34.321 --> 24:39.293

the strongest part
of our case will be you.

Your common sense.
Your seat-of-the-pants wisdom.

24:43.030 --> 24:45.367

tell you cigarettes...

24:45.433 --> 24:49.337
<i>are non-addictive</i>
<i>or don't cause cancer,</i>
<i>you'll know better.</i>

24:49.404 --> 24:51.939
<i>We won't have to tell you.</i>

24:53.108 --> 24:55.310
Lastly,

24:55.377 --> 24:58.647
this lawsuit is about
compensating Mr. Ray...

24:58.714 --> 25:01.183
<i>for his loss.</i>

25:04.086 --> 25:07.456
I think we all know
you can't really do that.

25:07.523 --> 25:10.793
He lost his wife
of 43 years.

25:10.859 --> 25:13.362
Her death was slow,

25:13.429 --> 25:16.232
and it was painful.

25:16.299 --> 25:18.935
As Mr. Ray's lawyer,
I suppose I should attempt...

25:19.002 --> 25:22.005
to tap into his grief,
so you people can feel it.

25:22.071 --> 25:25.342
Well, that's another thing
I won't be doing in this trial.

25:25.409 --> 25:29.246
I would never presume to be able
to articulate his pain.

25:29.313 --> 25:33.050
Nor would I presume your ability
to truly feel it,

25:33.117 --> 25:35.085
unless you've
been through it.

25:37.487 --> 25:42.192
What I will try to tap into,
however, is his anger.

25:42.260 --> 25:45.730
The woman he loved died from
smoking their cigarettes.

25:45.796 --> 25:49.600
And he received no apology,
no condolences,

25:49.667 --> 25:52.437
not even the slightest
admission...

25:52.503 --> 25:54.973
that they are
at all blameworthy.

25:56.808 --> 26:01.112
Maybe corporations,
if they're big enough,
don't have to apologize.

26:01.179 --> 26:03.715
Maybe corporations can put
advertisements like this...

26:03.782 --> 26:05.651
on billboards all across
the country--

26:05.717 --> 26:07.887
or like this--

26:07.954 --> 26:12.424
enticing people to use a product
that could give them cancer,

26:12.491 --> 26:15.862
probably will give them cancer,

26:15.928 --> 26:17.997
and feel no remorse.

26:20.800 --> 26:26.773
The defendant, T.L. Michaels,
generates revenues exceeding
$28 billion a year.

26:26.840 --> 26:31.078

$76 million a day. A day.

- Objection.
This is totally irrelevant.
- Overruled.

that the money they make
has no relevance.

26:55.270 --> 26:57.906
die from smoking.

26:57.972 --> 27:01.110
One person every 10 seconds.

27:01.176 --> 27:05.815
One person
every 10 seconds.

27:05.881 --> 27:09.084
This case is only about
Margaret Ray.

27:09.151 --> 27:13.789
This case is only about
her suffering and his.

27:15.258 --> 27:18.594
And yet,
I still cannot bring myself
to call it "irrelevant"...

27:18.661 --> 27:22.866
that in the short time
I've been delivering
my opening statement,

27:22.933 --> 27:26.269
they took in another
million dollars or so...

27:26.336 --> 27:29.473
and 50 more people died.

27:31.442 --> 27:33.810
There's something wrong
with that picture.

27:33.877 --> 27:36.113
And that one.
And that one.

27:36.180 --> 27:39.884
And if a corporation makes
billions and billions
of dollars...

27:39.951 --> 27:44.622
while its product continues
to kill and kill and kill--

27:44.689 --> 27:47.592
If we just chalk that up
to free society,

27:47.659 --> 27:51.028
well, there's something
wrong with that picture
as well.

28:15.221 --> 28:18.557
No, no, no, no.
We are not going on TV
with a case pending.

28:18.624 --> 28:22.328
Then who speaks up for Gerald?
Let me do it. If you don't
want to appear, I can--

28:22.395 --> 28:24.498
You? Leonard Goode
is a professional advocate.

28:24.564 --> 28:26.800
He'd chew you up like
a breath mint. No offense.

28:26.866 --> 28:30.337
[ Danny ] I won't debate him.
I'll just say Jerry shouldn't
be automatically condemned.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.606
He lost his daughter.
He shouldn't be vilified.
That's all.

28:32.672 --> 28:34.942
It's too dangerous.
Better that than let
Leonard Goode go unopposed.

28:35.009 --> 28:38.613
-Jerry will get hung out to dry.
-Bobby, there is
some truth to this.

28:38.679 --> 28:41.682
Public opinion
is gonna count big,
especially if we try to plead.

28:41.749 --> 28:43.984
Little spin wouldn't hurt.

28:44.051 --> 28:46.321
If we do, we just
offer perspective.

28:46.387 --> 28:48.723
We don't get
argumentative, Danny.

28:48.789 --> 28:50.891
I promise.

- I have Anderson Pearson

Hello? Yes.
7:00 would be fine.
Thank you.

29:14.483 --> 29:16.853
It's a trick.
It's an ambush.
I feel it.

29:16.919 --> 29:19.422
- What ambush?
How are they gonna ambush us?
- Okay, look, look, look.

29:19.489 --> 29:22.925

First off, we are all going.

"Don't hasten to prejudge

30:00.064 --> 30:01.900
Do we have
an understanding on this?

30:01.966 --> 30:03.168
Yes.
Pancake.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.905
Pancake.
Let's pick our numbers.

No eye bugging.

- Forget easy, Bobby.

31:31.795 --> 31:33.597
That offer is rejected.

31:36.100 --> 31:40.805
That offer is only being made
because sometimes it's cheaper
to shoo away a mosquito...

31:40.871 --> 31:42.807
rather than
to slap it dead.

31:42.873 --> 31:45.943
Look, I'm not gonna pretend
that we measure up here
on legal talent,

31:46.010 --> 31:47.878
but let's be honest.

31:47.945 --> 31:50.248
You wouldn't be making
any settlement if you
weren't anxious.

31:50.315 --> 31:54.152
Anxious to avoid
a protracted trial.
That's all.

31:54.219 --> 31:57.088
I understand.
But we have taken away
your defense.

31:57.155 --> 32:00.959
Your strategy of blaming
the victim? Gone.
We already blamed her.

32:01.026 --> 32:04.896
Your scientific assault on
nicotine being addictive? Gone.

32:04.963 --> 32:06.865
We're not arguing addiction.

Your medical-technical wizardry

don't cause cancer?

We want you
to argue that one.

32:12.738 --> 32:15.474
You know, we might be crazy,
but there's a climate
out there right now.

32:15.541 --> 32:19.879
<i>States are suing tobacco</i>
<i>companies for health costs</i>
<i>associated with smoking.</i>

32:19.946 --> 32:24.317
We are taking the gamble that
the public, and those jurors--

32:24.384 --> 32:26.653
they already know
that you're the bad guys.

32:26.719 --> 32:28.655
You've already lost one.

32:28.721 --> 32:32.893
Just a matter of time
before a jury in Massachusetts
is gonna want to pinch you.

32:32.960 --> 32:37.831
And if we get them there,
to the point where they
want you to feel a sting?

32:37.898 --> 32:40.133
Even a little sting?
Imagine.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.269
A million dollars
is no pinch to you.

32:42.336 --> 32:45.072
<i>Ten million</i>
<i>isn't even a pimple.</i>

32:45.139 --> 32:47.775
You rake in
76 million a day.

32:47.841 --> 32:49.877
A day.

32:49.944 --> 32:54.082
What if they think for killing
Margaret Ray, you should forfeit
just one day's proceeds?

32:54.148 --> 32:56.350
Or even half a day.

32:56.417 --> 32:58.587
And here's the biggest
thing of all.

32:58.653 --> 33:01.523
Most victims don't
bother to sue because you're
just too big a windmill.

33:01.590 --> 33:06.395
What if you should ever lose
a jury trial to a plaintiff
who puts on so simple a case?

33:06.461 --> 33:09.264
<i>Four witnesses,</i>
<i>no autopsy needed?</i>

33:09.331 --> 33:12.501
We'd be profiled in every

would be in my office.

33:12.567 --> 33:15.304
And plaintiffs would suddenly
be coming out of the woodwork.

33:18.974 --> 33:22.878
Well, you just have it all
figured out, don't you?

33:22.945 --> 33:25.315
No, Mr. Pearson,
we don't.

33:25.381 --> 33:28.384
<i>We're just guessing.</i>
<i>I admit that. But...</i>

33:28.451 --> 33:31.187
suppose we guess right.

33:31.254 --> 33:33.389
Can you really afford
to take that kind of chance?

33:33.456 --> 33:35.526
Can you?

33:35.592 --> 33:39.196
With your contingency fee,
you're turning down $150,000.

33:39.263 --> 33:44.468
Now, it's just a hunch,
but I suspect you could
use that money.

33:47.772 --> 33:49.606

Good evening, and welcome
to <i>Prime Watch.</i>
I'm Suzannah Riley.

34:55.110 --> 34:58.679
Tonight, the stunning events
surrounding the Martin trial...

34:58.746 --> 35:01.582
and the renewed debate
over the question of revenge.

35:01.649 --> 35:03.551
They're gonna make
another offer.
When? Tonight?

35:03.619 --> 35:05.621
Maybe.
What makes you think that?

35:05.687 --> 35:08.390
They offered four.
He turned it down.
What?

35:08.457 --> 35:11.460
- <i>Et tu,</i> Rebecca?
- Damn right, <i>et tu!</i> We were
hoping for three, <i>et tu.</i>

35:11.527 --> 35:13.462
Listen to me, all of you.

35:13.529 --> 35:16.332
They have a huge interest
in settling this before
the actual trial starts.

35:16.398 --> 35:19.601
As soon as a witness takes
that stand, they're in trouble,
and they know it.

35:19.668 --> 35:21.838
- [ All ] Why?
- Because if they can
get rid of it now,

35:21.904 --> 35:23.973
they can sell it publicly
as a nuisance settlement.

35:24.040 --> 35:27.444
<i>As soon as the trial's</i>
<i>in progress, any settlement</i>
<i>is perceived as a defeat.</i>

35:27.510 --> 35:29.679
<i>That's why they had</i>
<i>this meeting tonight.</i>

35:29.746 --> 35:32.915
- They wanna make this go away
before the trial gets started.
- But you turned it down!

35:32.983 --> 35:34.918
Four isn't enough.

35:34.985 --> 35:37.821
- They're gonna make
another offer.
- You hope.

35:37.888 --> 35:40.591
Yes, I hope.
I hope.

35:40.658 --> 35:43.126
- I hope, I hope, I hope.
- Ah, look!

35:43.193 --> 35:45.262
Here they go.

35:45.329 --> 35:48.266
[ Riley ]
...both of you attended every
session of the Martin trial.

35:48.332 --> 35:50.368
Oh, God, help us.

35:50.434 --> 35:54.939
Strange to find
two religious leaders
embroiled in a murder case.

35:55.006 --> 35:58.376
But even more strange
that each of you seems to be...

35:58.442 --> 36:00.779
embracing the respective
murderer, if you will.

36:00.845 --> 36:04.349
I neither embraced nor condoned
what Ronald Martin did.

36:04.416 --> 36:06.351
I simply
offered him forgiveness.

36:06.418 --> 36:09.354
Okay. Why?
He murdered a girl.

36:09.421 --> 36:11.656
For which he was judged
to be insane at the time.

36:11.723 --> 36:15.728
But there was no suggestion
of insanity at the time
Father O'Brien forgave him.

36:15.795 --> 36:18.063
Easy, Danny.

36:18.130 --> 36:20.232
I refer to the Old Testament,
which demands total forgiveness.

36:20.299 --> 36:22.668
Yes.
It also talks about
eye for an eye,

36:22.735 --> 36:24.704
which is about avenging evil.

36:24.770 --> 36:27.273
Truth be told,
Dr. Braun's crime...

36:27.340 --> 36:29.209
was far worse than
Ronald Martin's.

36:29.275 --> 36:33.814
- What?
- Ronald Martin's act
was of an insane impulse.

36:33.880 --> 36:37.551
Dr. Braun's, however,
was deliberate, premeditated...

36:37.618 --> 36:39.586
and therefore
more repugnant.

36:39.653 --> 36:43.224
An opinion you would quickly
change, of course, should
Dr. Braun put you on retainer.

36:43.290 --> 36:45.159
<i>I take exception to that,</i>
<i>Rabbi.</i>

36:45.226 --> 36:47.794
You're hardly an arbiter
of what's repugnant.
Ronald Martin was a murderer.

36:47.861 --> 36:51.665
You celebrated the night
you freed him.
As did you celebrate, I suspect,

36:51.733 --> 36:54.836
when Dr. Braun
was granted bail.

36:54.902 --> 36:59.374
Right now, an admitted killer
is out walking on the streets.

36:59.441 --> 37:02.210
Well, who put who
back on the streets, Mr. Goode?

37:02.277 --> 37:05.347
Oh, no.
His cheeks are flushing.

37:05.413 --> 37:08.450
If someday you are charged
with a crime, Rabbi,

37:08.516 --> 37:12.520
would you hire somebody
who feels more responsible
for society's fate or your own?

37:12.588 --> 37:14.623
That's one way
of looking at it.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.092
Another way is,
if I were murdered,
you'd be standing...

37:17.159 --> 37:19.295
first in line
to get my killer off.
Oh, please.

37:19.362 --> 37:20.996
Please.
This guy's good.

37:21.064 --> 37:23.532
[ Riley ]
Certainly, Rabbi, you believe
that all accused criminals...

37:23.599 --> 37:25.468
are entitled to a defense.

37:25.534 --> 37:28.337
A truthful defense.
But that's not what he offers.

37:28.404 --> 37:31.841
The jury never
got to hear the truth
in Ronald Martin's trial.

37:31.908 --> 37:34.611
They never knew
that he previously tried
to kill another girl,

37:34.678 --> 37:36.613
because he suppressed
that information.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.982
Your problem is with
the Constitution.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.118
No, no. His problem
is with lawyers like you...

37:41.185 --> 37:44.154
who use the Constitution
to get off scum
like Ronald Martin.

37:44.221 --> 37:47.157
He's not scum.
Stop slandering this young man.
He's dead.

37:47.224 --> 37:50.628
There's nothing wrong with
slandering dead murderers.
I read the Bible.

37:50.695 --> 37:53.197
[ O'Brien ]
That's ridiculous.
Gentlemen, please.

37:53.263 --> 37:55.400
What if everybody who was
unhappy with a verdict...

37:55.466 --> 37:57.268
took it upon themselves
to exact revenge?

37:57.335 --> 38:00.805
A lot of injustice would occur,
but this isn't such a case.

38:00.871 --> 38:04.876
And Jerry Braun shouldn't be
crucified because of what might
hypothetically happen...

38:04.943 --> 38:07.646
if you don't condemn him
on some legal principle,

38:07.713 --> 38:10.048
when morally,
it's not so simple.

38:10.115 --> 38:12.651
- No.
- If Gerald Braun came
to you before and said,

38:12.718 --> 38:14.986
"Oh, by the way, I'm going
to kill Ronald Martin,"

38:15.053 --> 38:17.223
I hardly think you'd give him
your moral blessing.

38:17.289 --> 38:19.391
Well, you would be wrong,
Mr. Goode,

38:19.458 --> 38:21.560
because Dr. Braun
did come to me,

38:21.627 --> 38:23.796
and I did
give him my blessing.

38:23.863 --> 38:27.199
- What?
- <i>[ Riley ]</i>
<i>Wait a second.</i>

38:27.266 --> 38:31.404
You told Gerald Braun that it
was okay to shoot Ronald Martin?

38:31.471 --> 38:33.440
He-He never said that.

38:33.506 --> 38:38.045
I said between Ronald Martin
going free and Ronald Martin
being dead,

38:38.111 --> 38:40.513
it was more moral
for him to be dead.

38:40.580 --> 38:44.852
- Mother of God!
- Page Jimmy as soon
as they go off the air.

38:44.918 --> 38:46.987
<i>Tell him to drag</i>
<i>Danny's ass in here.</i>

38:47.054 --> 38:48.922
I don't believe this.
That's not in the Torah.

38:50.758 --> 38:53.727
- <i>[ Phone Rings ]</i>
- <i>[ Bobby ]</i>
Hello?

38:53.794 --> 38:57.665
Yes, this is Mr. Donnell.
Oh, hi.

38:57.731 --> 39:00.068
Listen, I don't--
I don't mean to be impolite.

39:01.269 --> 39:03.204
Well, sure.

39:06.708 --> 39:09.043
That was Anderson Pearson.

39:09.110 --> 39:11.146
He's on his way over.

39:11.213 --> 39:12.447
What?
Here?

39:12.514 --> 39:15.885
- Yes. Here.
- Please. Whatever he offers,
just say yes.

39:15.951 --> 39:17.987
- Thank you, Rebecca.
- Here?

39:18.053 --> 39:20.956
Yes, here.

39:21.023 --> 39:24.159
Bobby's very upset.
Very, very upset.
Why?

39:24.226 --> 39:26.562
Why?
You encouraged Dr. Braun
to commit a homicide.

39:26.629 --> 39:29.265
This is not an appropriate thing
rabbis should do with
their congregants.

39:29.332 --> 39:31.334
Mr. Warner?
Yes?

39:31.401 --> 39:33.236
Detective Robert Belle,
Boston Police.

39:33.303 --> 39:36.673
Would you place your hands
behind your back please, sir?
What? Why?

39:36.740 --> 39:39.209
Accessory to murder?

39:39.275 --> 39:42.746
All right, all right, all right,
all right. Let-- Let's get him
arraigned tonight.

39:42.813 --> 39:45.949
If we do it tomorrow,
the press'll be all over it.
Can you handle the arraignment?

39:46.016 --> 39:48.319
Of course I can do it.
What kind of a question's that?

39:48.385 --> 39:51.755
Okay. I can't imagine
they'll ask bail.
Plead not guilty.

39:51.822 --> 39:55.827
Oh, thanks. You know,
I was gonna plead him guilty
and get him a life sentence.

39:55.893 --> 39:58.095
He's got such great faith.

39:58.162 --> 40:00.064
Tell him not to worry,

40:00.131 --> 40:02.934
this is bogus,
it's just showtime and that
I'll take care of it, okay?

40:03.000 --> 40:05.903
- <i>[ Bobby ]</i>
Not guilty, Jimmy.
- You're a stitch!

40:05.970 --> 40:08.873
Can you believe it?
They arrested him.

40:08.941 --> 40:10.909
- What a night.
- <i>[ Knocking ]</i>

40:21.019 --> 40:25.124
I'm not going to
preface anything
or do a big sell.

40:25.191 --> 40:28.727
This check has
already been signed,
so there's nothing to negotiate.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.730
You either take it
or leave it.

40:30.797 --> 40:33.532
But this will be
our final offer.

40:33.600 --> 40:37.704
It's designed to be preemptive.
After this, we will take
our chance with the jury.

40:37.771 --> 40:42.041
Even one which happens
to find you adorable.

40:43.410 --> 40:45.545
What's the number?

40:45.612 --> 40:48.682
If you never believe
anything I ever say,

40:48.749 --> 40:51.218
believe that this is
the last and final offer.

40:51.285 --> 40:55.790
What's the number?
One point seven million.

41:04.299 --> 41:06.467
Accepted.

41:06.534 --> 41:10.606
No admission of liability,
confidentiality,
the usual language.

41:10.672 --> 41:14.175
You have full
power of attorney?
I-- I do.

41:14.242 --> 41:17.078
Sign.

41:23.886 --> 41:26.088
We'll make copies.

41:27.857 --> 41:32.829
This is yours.
Tell your client
congratulations.

41:38.135 --> 41:42.705
And please tell him
that I'm--

41:46.243 --> 41:49.713
that, uh, we're very sorry
about his loss.

42:13.405 --> 42:15.907
You-- You--

42:19.611 --> 42:22.281
- This is good.
- Yeah.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.752
Can we get
a conference table now?

42:28.288 --> 42:31.924
[ Chuckling ]

42:31.991 --> 42:33.893
Yeah.

42:35.161 --> 42:38.698
I don't know, but, um,
maybe we should tell the client.

42:38.765 --> 42:41.367
[ All Laughing ]

42:41.434 --> 42:43.770
Tell him we settled
for 400.

42:43.837 --> 42:46.106
[ All Laughing ]

42:46.172 --> 42:48.442
And Jimmy.
We gotta tell Jimmy.

42:48.509 --> 42:50.811
Oh, God. Jimmy.

42:50.877 --> 42:55.549
James L. Berluti
representing the defendant.
We waive reading, Your Honor.

42:55.616 --> 43:01.355
And pursuant
to my authority as counsel,
I enter a plea of not guilty.

43:01.422 --> 43:04.191
Bail?

43:04.258 --> 43:07.329
We'd be requesting an immediate
trial date, Your Honor.

43:07.395 --> 43:10.598
My client feels scorned
by these horrible charges,

43:10.665 --> 43:14.069
and would like an opportunity
forthwith to clear his name.

43:14.136 --> 43:16.004
Forthwith.

43:16.071 --> 43:18.541
Two weeks, Monday.
Is that "forthwith" enough?

43:18.607 --> 43:22.345
Oh, this would be suitable.
Thank you, Your Highness--
Honor.

43:23.446 --> 43:26.815
Personal recognizance.
See Probation. Next.

43:26.882 --> 43:29.285
<i>[ Gavel Raps ]</i>

43:29.352 --> 43:32.088
That went very well.
Very, very well.

43:34.390 --> 43:37.627
<i>All right!</i>
<i>I don't know what to say!</i>

43:37.694 --> 43:39.596
Every law firm
said to me, "No way!"

43:39.663 --> 43:43.166
<i>You people said, "Maybe."</i>
<i>And you backed it up.</i>

43:43.233 --> 43:47.237
- Well, that's mainly because
of Miss Awesome here.
- And Bobby with his game plan.

43:47.304 --> 43:50.140
- Ah, which only I supported,
by the way.
- Oh, get out of here.

43:50.207 --> 43:53.778
- [ Ray ] Say, where is Bobby?
- Oh, he'll be here.
He and Rebecca are locking up.

43:53.844 --> 43:57.281
But they'll be here.
Good. Here's to Bobby.

44:38.691 --> 44:40.627
Hey, Beck.

44:40.693 --> 44:42.829
Hey.

44:45.999 --> 44:48.902
Guess we should
get goin'.

44:50.170 --> 44:52.706
Yeah.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.775
It's okay to cry a little.

44:54.916 --> 44:57.449
Ah, it's just--

44:57.516 --> 44:59.549
just money.

44:59.616 --> 45:01.516
Just a settlement.

45:03.749 --> 45:05.682
Okay.

45:07.749 --> 45:09.649
Then I'll cry.
[ Crying ]

45:32.582 --> 45:35.116
You should call your dad.

45:38.682 --> 45:40.616
Yeah.
