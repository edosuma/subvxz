07:25.500 --> 07:26.300
YOU DECIDED YOU DIDN'T WANT TO

07:26.300 --> 07:27.367
WORK AT THE MALL?

07:27.367 --> 07:29.267
>> OKAY, I SEE YOU'RE DONE WITH

07:29.267 --> 07:31.167
THIS.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.167
SO WHO YOU HERE WITH?

07:33.167 --> 07:34.933
>> JUST SOME FRIENDS FROM WORK.

07:34.933 --> 07:36.133
>> YOU MEAN THAT PACK OF WILD

07:36.133 --> 07:37.633
WOMEN YOU WERE RACING?

07:37.633 --> 07:39.933
WHERE DO YOU WORK, NASCAR?

07:39.933 --> 07:40.900
>> INDULGENCE, A BOUTIQUE IN

07:40.900 --> 07:42.433
BUCKHEAD.

07:42.433 --> 07:44.633
THANKS FOR THE HOTDOG.

07:44.633 --> 07:46.667
I'M MORGAN, AND I'M ALSO

07:46.667 --> 07:47.800
THIRSTY.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.767
>> IT'S NICE MEETING YOU.

07:49.767 --> 07:52.167
I'M PEARCE.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.067
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO GIVE ME

07:53.067 --> 07:54.267
THESE?

07:54.267 --> 07:57.167
[whistles]

07:57.167 --> 07:58.567
THOSE ARE SOME KIDS I SPONSOR.

07:58.567 --> 08:00.733
I VOLUNTEER AT A YOUTH CENTER.

08:00.733 --> 08:01.500
INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM IN JAIL,

08:01.500 --> 08:03.867
NOW I TRY TO KEEP THEM OUT.

08:03.867 --> 08:05.533
>> HUH, I WISH MORE OF OUR MEN

08:05.533 --> 08:07.933
FOUND TIME TO GIVE BACK.

08:07.933 --> 08:09.533
I ADMIRE THAT.

08:09.533 --> 08:11.067
>> WELL, I BETTER ROUND THEM UP

08:11.067 --> 08:13.900
BEFORE THEY TEAR UP THE PLACE.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.833
IT WAS NICE CHATTING WITH YOU.

08:25.500 --> 08:29.267
>> SCARVES, JEANS, JACKETS--

08:29.267 --> 08:30.167
DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY,

08:30.167 --> 08:31.267
BUT IT'S A SHAME YOU'RE SELLING

08:31.267 --> 08:33.300
YOUR STUFF IN A GO-KART PLACE.

08:33.300 --> 08:34.800
IT'S TOO GOOD.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.533
>> GOOD ENOUGH TO SELL AT

08:35.533 --> 08:36.700
INDULGENCE?

08:36.700 --> 08:38.533
>> I DON'T KNOW.

08:38.533 --> 08:39.233
I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO KNOW

08:39.233 --> 08:40.500
SOMEONE.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.433
>> WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD SET UP

08:41.433 --> 08:42.767
A MEETING WITH YOUR BOSS, AND HE

08:42.767 --> 08:44.700
OR SHE COULD TAKE A LOOK.

08:44.700 --> 08:45.700
MAYBE THEY'LL LIKE IT TOO.

08:45.700 --> 08:46.633
>> IT'S A SHE, BUT DON'T HOLD

08:46.633 --> 08:48.767
THAT AGAINST HER.

08:48.767 --> 08:51.267
ANYWAY, GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER, AND

08:51.267 --> 08:54.733
I'LL TRY AND SET SOMETHING UP.

08:54.733 --> 08:57.167
[all screaming]

08:57.167 --> 09:04.067
[laughter]

09:04.067 --> 09:05.600
>> WHOO!

09:05.600 --> 09:08.533
I WON!

09:08.533 --> 09:11.067
>> OKAY, YOU GUYS READY?

09:11.067 --> 09:12.167
I GUESS I CAN'T PUT OFF ANY

09:12.167 --> 09:13.733
LONGER WHAT I GOT TO DO TONIGHT.

09:13.733 --> 09:14.600
>> ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO END

09:14.600 --> 09:15.967
THINGS WITH SEAN?

09:15.967 --> 09:17.800
>> WAIT, WHAT HAPPENED TO LOVING

09:17.800 --> 09:18.733
THE ONE YOU'RE WITH?

09:18.733 --> 09:20.333
>> I'M TRYING, BUT THE MORE DAYS

09:20.333 --> 09:21.900
GO BY AND NOTHING CHANGES, THE

09:21.900 --> 09:23.300
MORE UNFAIR IT IS.

09:23.300 --> 09:25.300
WE BOTH DESERVE BETTER.

09:25.300 --> 09:30.467
COME ON.

09:30.467 --> 09:31.633
>> MORGAN, THAT GUY YOU WERE

09:31.633 --> 09:33.233
TALKING TO WAS HANDSOME.

09:33.233 --> 09:35.067
>> FOR MY MOTHER, MAYBE.

09:35.067 --> 09:35.833
>> I'LL BE RUNNING ABOUT

09:35.833 --> 09:37.600
15 MINUTES LATE, SEAN.

09:37.600 --> 09:41.067
I'LL BE--OH, MY GOD!

09:41.067 --> 09:45.100
MY CAR!

09:45.100 --> 09:48.700
SOMEONE SLASHED MY TIRES.

09:59.267 --> 09:59.867
>> WELL, I'M BEAT.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.033
THANKS AGAIN FOR PICKING US UP,

10:01.033 --> 10:01.900
SEAN.

10:01.900 --> 10:02.700
YOU WERE LIKE A KNIGHT IN

10:02.700 --> 10:04.133
SHINING MERCEDES.

10:04.133 --> 10:04.900
>> [chuckles]

10:04.900 --> 10:06.633
HAPPY TO HELP.

10:06.633 --> 10:09.333
>> GOOD NIGHT, KEISHA.

10:09.333 --> 10:10.767
>> OH, YEAH, NIGHT.

10:10.767 --> 10:11.967
>> NIGHT.

10:11.967 --> 10:13.400
YOU'RE QUIET.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.800
YOU OKAY?

10:14.800 --> 10:16.267
>> NO.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.633
I'M UPSET.

10:17.633 --> 10:19.667
WHO COULD'VE DONE THIS?

10:19.667 --> 10:20.400
>> PROBABLY JUST SOME HATER

10:20.400 --> 10:22.467
WITH ASTON MARTIN ENVY.

10:22.467 --> 10:23.167
ALL RIGHT, THE POLICE SAID

10:23.167 --> 10:24.000
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF VANDALISM

10:24.000 --> 10:25.500
IN THAT AREA LATELY.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.533
>> SEAN, MY CAR DIDN'T GET

10:27.533 --> 10:29.033
"TAGGED."

10:29.033 --> 10:30.567
ALL FOUR OF MY TIRES WERE

10:30.567 --> 10:32.100
SLASHED.

10:32.100 --> 10:35.700
THAT FEELS PREMEDITATED.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.767
AND IF IT WAS PERSONAL, THEN

10:37.767 --> 10:39.767
THAT MEANS SOMEBODY FOLLOWED ME,

10:39.767 --> 10:42.267
AND THEY KNOW WHERE I LIVE.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.433
>> YOU DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.

10:44.433 --> 10:45.300
BUT THAT'S WHY I'M STAYING THE

10:45.300 --> 10:46.700
NIGHT.

10:46.700 --> 10:49.500
JUST IN CASE.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.033
>> I WOULD FEEL SAFER.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.467
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

10:53.467 --> 10:54.700
GO HOP IN THE TUB.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.100
I'LL MAKE YOU SOME TEA.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.433
>> YEAH.

10:57.433 --> 11:06.067
THANKS.

11:06.067 --> 11:07.267
THANK YOU, SEAN.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.800
THIS IS REALLY NICE.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.733
>> DID YOU KNOW THIS RIGHT HERE

11:11.733 --> 11:15.633
RELAXES YOUR NECK?

11:15.633 --> 11:17.700
AND THIS HERE RELAXES YOUR

11:17.700 --> 11:21.267
SHOULDERS.

11:21.267 --> 11:22.133
>> YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE RELAXES MY

11:22.133 --> 11:23.800
NECK AND MY SHOULDERS?

11:23.800 --> 11:25.367
>> WHAT?

11:25.367 --> 11:26.367
>> RUBBING MY NECK AND MY

11:26.367 --> 11:27.300
SHOULDERS.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.767
>> [laughs]

11:30.767 --> 11:34.100
>> * DOWN, BABY

11:34.100 --> 11:38.733
* IS IT THE WAY

11:38.733 --> 11:45.600
* YOU LOVE ME, BABY

11:45.600 --> 11:48.467
*

11:48.467 --> 11:52.533
* IS IT THE WAY

11:52.533 --> 12:00.833
* YOU LOVE ME, BABY

12:00.833 --> 12:01.633
* YEAH

12:01.633 --> 12:03.067
>> MM.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.600
[scoffs]

12:04.600 --> 12:06.133
WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING FOR, MAN OF

12:06.133 --> 12:07.733
THE YEAR?

12:07.733 --> 12:09.600
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

12:09.600 --> 12:11.267
>> YOU SWOOP TO MY RESCUE, SPEND

12:11.267 --> 12:12.667
THE NIGHT WITHOUT TRYING

12:12.667 --> 12:14.400
ANYTHING, THEN YOU WAKE UP EARLY

12:14.400 --> 12:15.400
AND MAKE ME BREAKFAST.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.267
>> WELL, I HATED THE

12:16.267 --> 12:18.267
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT ANY CHANCE I

12:18.267 --> 12:19.567
GET TO TAKE CARE OF YOU, YOU

12:19.567 --> 12:21.900
KNOW THAT I WILL.

12:21.900 --> 12:23.133
AND NOW I'VE GOT TO GO SUE

12:23.133 --> 12:24.067
SOMEBODY.

12:24.067 --> 12:25.433
>> [laughs]

12:25.433 --> 12:26.267
>> OH, YEAH, AND YOUR CAR WILL

12:26.267 --> 12:27.533
BE READY AT 6:00.

12:27.533 --> 12:28.400
IT WOULD'VE BEEN READY AT 4:00,

12:28.400 --> 12:30.700
BUT I'VE GOT ONE OF MY FIRM'S

12:30.700 --> 12:32.300
INVESTIGATORS CHECKING IT FOR

12:32.300 --> 12:33.133
PRINTS.

12:33.133 --> 12:36.300
>> OKAY, SUPERMAN.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.267
THANK YOU AGAIN.

12:37.267 --> 12:37.967
>> AND, AFTER WE PICK UP YOUR

12:37.967 --> 12:39.633
CAR LATER, I WANT TO TAKE YOU

12:39.633 --> 12:41.667
SOMEWHERE.

12:41.667 --> 12:46.700
>> SEAN, I...

12:46.700 --> 12:48.367
I'LL BE READY.

12:48.367 --> 12:54.067
>> [laughs]

12:54.067 --> 12:55.067
MORNING.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.533
>> MORNING.

12:57.533 --> 12:58.600
HUH.

12:58.600 --> 13:01.067
FRESH BISCUITS AND KISSES...

13:01.067 --> 13:01.833
I GUESS IT WASN'T AN UGLY

13:01.833 --> 13:02.633
BREAKUP.

13:02.633 --> 13:03.667
>> I COULDN'T DO IT.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.533
>> OH, IT WAS KIND OF ROMANTIC,

13:05.533 --> 13:07.633
THE WAY HE JUST TOOK CHARGE AND

13:07.633 --> 13:09.067
HANDLED THAT SITUATION.

13:09.067 --> 13:09.933
>> YEAH, AND HE PRINCE CHARMED

13:09.933 --> 13:11.433
HIS WAY INTO SPENDING THE NIGHT.

13:11.433 --> 13:12.267
>> IS THAT ALL HE PRINCE CHARMED

13:12.267 --> 13:13.333
HIS WAY INTO?

13:13.333 --> 13:14.067
>> [scoffs]

13:14.067 --> 13:15.867
IT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR SEX.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.433
WE STAYED UP ALL NIGHT TALKING

13:17.433 --> 13:19.267
AND LAUGHING.

13:19.267 --> 13:20.933
HE JUST MADE ME FEEL SAFE.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.133
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FIREWORKS,

13:22.133 --> 13:24.367
BUT IT SURE WAS NICE TO HAVE A

13:24.367 --> 13:26.100
WARM, STEADY FIRE.

13:26.100 --> 13:26.900
>> SO NOW YOU'RE HAVING SECOND

13:26.900 --> 13:28.067
THOUGHTS?

13:28.067 --> 13:29.167
>> I KNOW I'M ALL OVER THE PLACE

13:29.167 --> 13:30.433
WITH THIS MAN.

13:30.433 --> 13:32.300
BUT HE IS DIALING UP THE SWEET.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.700
MAYBE I'LL GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE

13:33.700 --> 13:34.567
TIME.

13:34.567 --> 13:35.367
>> YES!

13:35.367 --> 13:36.267
>> GIRL, THANKS FOR CARING, BUT

13:36.267 --> 13:37.600
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO EXCITED.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.267
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:38.267 --> 13:39.433
I BID ON A VINTAGE GUITAR FOR

13:39.433 --> 13:40.733
CHARLES, AND I JUST WON.

13:40.733 --> 13:41.933
I DECIDED TO GET SOMETHING EXTRA

13:41.933 --> 13:43.333
SPECIAL FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.100
>> DAMN!

13:44.100 --> 13:45.133
IS THAT THE PRICE OR THE YEAR?

13:45.133 --> 13:46.800
SHOOT. CAN I BE SPECIAL?

13:46.800 --> 13:48.133
>> [laughs]

13:48.133 --> 13:49.067
>> [vocalizing]

13:49.067 --> 13:51.267
*

13:51.267 --> 13:52.100
>> WHICH DO YOU THINK IS

13:52.100 --> 13:54.067
STRONGER: "DEVASTATING" OR

13:54.067 --> 13:54.900
"GUT-WRENCHING"?

13:54.900 --> 13:56.300
>> "GUT-WRENCHING."

13:56.300 --> 13:57.833
[typing]

13:57.833 --> 13:58.967
>> "EGOMANIAC" OR

13:58.967 --> 14:00.500
"MEGALOMANIAC"?

14:00.500 --> 14:01.833
>> UH-HUH. THAT'S CUTE.

14:01.833 --> 14:02.967
>> OMAR, ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING

14:02.967 --> 14:03.700
TO ME?

14:03.700 --> 14:04.433
>> SORRY.

14:04.433 --> 14:05.900
I WAS TEXTING WITH BRANDON.

14:05.900 --> 14:06.900
HE'S A PISCES, SO I HAVE TO

14:06.900 --> 14:07.967
RESPOND QUICKLY.

14:07.967 --> 14:10.800
THEY'RE VERY EMOTIONAL.

14:10.800 --> 14:11.633
>> I WILL GO WITH

14:11.633 --> 14:13.267
"MEGALOMANIAC."

14:13.267 --> 14:16.700
[typing]

14:16.700 --> 14:17.700
>> WHAT DID THAT COMPUTER DO TO

14:17.700 --> 14:18.367
YOU?

14:18.367 --> 14:19.500
>> WELL, SINCE REGGIE REFUSES TO

14:19.500 --> 14:20.800
CALL ME BACK, I REALLY HAVEN'T

14:20.800 --> 14:21.967
HAD A CHANCE TO EXPRESS MY

14:21.967 --> 14:22.833
ANGER.

14:22.833 --> 14:24.933
BUT I NEED CLOSURE, SO I DECIDED

14:24.933 --> 14:29.133
TO WRITE HIM A LETTER.

14:29.133 --> 14:30.400
>> "YOUR ASS MAKES ME SICK.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.867
YOU'RE A COWARD AND AN ASS.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.800
YOU'RE A COWARDLY-ASS COWARD."

14:34.800 --> 14:37.067
VERY ARTICULATE, BUT THERE'S NO

14:37.067 --> 14:38.100
"E" IN "COWARD."

14:38.100 --> 14:39.567
ALSO, WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE

14:39.567 --> 14:40.500
BIG WORDS YOU WERE ASKING ME

14:40.500 --> 14:41.267
ABOUT?

14:41.267 --> 14:42.367
>> OH, THEY'RE IN THE MARGINS.

14:42.367 --> 14:43.300
THEY'RE JUST TOO POLITE FOR THIS

14:43.300 --> 14:44.067
DRAFT.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.733
BUT I WILL BE USING THEM AT SOME

14:45.733 --> 14:53.400
POINT.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.800
>> HEY.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.633
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:56.633 --> 14:59.067
AND SO SOON.

14:59.067 --> 14:59.767
DID YOU HAVE ONE OF YOUR COP

14:59.767 --> 15:01.267
BUDDIES TRACK ME DOWN?

15:01.267 --> 15:02.700
>> YOU TOLD ME WHERE YOU WORKED.

15:02.700 --> 15:03.467
YOU THINK AN OLD GUY LIKE ME

15:03.467 --> 15:05.267
COULDN'T REMEMBER?

15:05.267 --> 15:06.267
BESIDES, I NEEDED TO DO SOME

15:06.267 --> 15:07.067
SHOPPING.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.867
>> AH, YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN

15:08.867 --> 15:10.133
PARTICULAR IN MIND?

15:10.133 --> 15:10.900
>> WELL, I'D LIKE SOMETHING I

15:10.900 --> 15:12.267
COULD WEAR TO A NICE DINNER.

15:12.267 --> 15:15.267
MAYBE EVEN A MOVIE.

15:15.267 --> 15:16.533
>> WE MIGHT HAVE A FEW THINGS

15:16.533 --> 15:23.433

22:39.333 --> 22:40.167
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I'M SUPPOSED TO

22:40.167 --> 22:41.333
JUMP TO HIS SCHEDULE.

22:41.333 --> 22:42.233
>> WELL, ARE YOU GONNA MEET UP

22:42.233 --> 22:43.067
WITH HIM?

22:43.067 --> 22:46.367
>> I MOST CERTAINLY AM.

22:50.433 --> 22:52.833
>> HE'S RIGHT THERE.

22:52.833 --> 22:56.167
>> HEY.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.333
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE?

22:57.333 --> 22:58.333
>> YEAH.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.467
AND I'D LIKE TO DO DINNER

23:00.467 --> 23:02.400
SOMETIME, IF THE INVITATION

23:02.400 --> 23:03.733
STILL STANDS.

23:03.733 --> 23:04.633
>> [laughs]

23:04.633 --> 23:11.800
IT CERTAINLY DOES.

23:11.800 --> 23:12.567
>> I WROTE THIS A LONG TIME AGO,

23:12.567 --> 23:14.667
BUT IT REMINDS ME OF A BEAUTIFUL

23:14.667 --> 23:18.300
LADY I JUST MET.

23:18.300 --> 23:19.233
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT HER, I

23:19.233 --> 23:20.900
GET LOST IN THOSE EYES.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.900
>> [giggles]

23:35.300 --> 23:35.967
>> HEY.

23:35.967 --> 23:36.633
>> [chuckles] HEY.

23:36.633 --> 23:37.500
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

23:37.500 --> 23:38.733
INVITING ME.

23:38.733 --> 23:39.733
YOU GUYS WERE GREAT.

23:39.733 --> 23:40.467
>> IT MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT YOU

23:40.467 --> 23:41.267
CAME.

23:41.267 --> 23:41.967
I BROUGHT THE GUITAR.

23:41.967 --> 23:42.633
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

23:42.633 --> 23:43.367
>> PERFECT.

23:43.367 --> 23:45.233
I'D CHECK IT, BUT I WOULDN'T

23:45.233 --> 23:46.367
EVEN KNOW WHAT I'D BE CHECKING

23:46.367 --> 23:47.067
IT FOR.

23:47.067 --> 23:47.767
>> DON'T WORRY.

23:47.767 --> 23:49.833
I HOOKED YOU UP.

23:59.367 --> 24:00.667
>> I'M SORRY.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.500
I CAN'T.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.567
>> ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.533
THAT WAS REALLY PRESUMPTUOUS OF

24:05.533 --> 24:06.233
ME.

24:06.233 --> 24:07.067
I DIDN'T EVEN ASK IF YOU HAD A

24:07.067 --> 24:08.533
BOYFRIEND.

24:08.533 --> 24:09.833
>> NOT EXACTLY.

24:09.833 --> 24:11.333
BUT WHEN WE JUST DID THAT, IT

24:11.333 --> 24:14.467
MADE ME REALIZE I DIDN'T WANT TO

24:14.467 --> 24:16.800
KISS ANYONE ELSE BUT HIM.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.767
>> OUCH.

24:18.767 --> 24:21.067
THAT WASN'T THE DESIRED EFFECT.

24:21.067 --> 24:22.967
SO YOU DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND,

24:22.967 --> 24:25.467
BUT WHEN WE KISSED, IT MADE YOU

24:25.467 --> 24:26.867
REALIZE YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY

24:26.867 --> 24:27.967
BUT THE GUY WHO'S NOT EXACTLY

24:27.967 --> 24:29.633
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

24:29.633 --> 24:30.500
>> I'M SORRY.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.833
I REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU AND I

24:31.833 --> 24:33.067
CONNECTED.

24:33.067 --> 24:34.067
>> I'M GONNA TAKE A WILD GUESS

24:34.067 --> 24:36.467
AND ASK, IS THIS GUITAR FOR THE

24:36.467 --> 24:37.500
GUY WHO'S NOT EXACTLY YOUR

24:37.500 --> 24:39.167
BOYFRIEND?

24:39.167 --> 24:40.833
>> YEAH.

24:40.833 --> 24:41.967
I FEEL REALLY BAD FOR LEADING

24:41.967 --> 24:42.867
YOU ON.

24:42.867 --> 24:44.267
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD.

24:44.267 --> 24:46.067
>> I DON'T WASTE TIME BEING MAD.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.467
LIFE'S TOO SHORT.

24:47.467 --> 24:49.200
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN BRIEF,

24:49.200 --> 24:50.567
I'M STILL GRATEFUL THAT I MET

24:50.567 --> 24:51.900
YOU.

24:51.900 --> 24:53.333
PLUS, I GOT TO KISS YOU.

24:53.333 --> 24:54.067
>> [chuckles]

24:54.067 --> 24:57.533
>> I'M SMILING.

24:57.533 --> 24:58.467
AREN'T YOU FORGETTING YOUR

24:58.467 --> 25:00.067
GUITAR?

25:00.067 --> 25:04.733
>> RIGHT.

25:04.733 --> 25:08.167
THANKS.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.233
>> MY HAND IS GONNA BE SO SORE

25:12.233 --> 25:13.433
IN THE MORNING.

25:13.433 --> 25:15.067
I CAN BARELY MOVE MY TRIGGER

25:15.067 --> 25:15.667
FINGER.

25:15.667 --> 25:16.767
>> OOH.

25:16.767 --> 25:18.233
[laughter]

25:18.233 --> 25:19.767
>> THANK YOU, SEAN.

25:19.767 --> 25:21.533
I HAD A GREAT DAY.

25:21.533 --> 25:24.133
I NEEDED TO BE EMPOWERED INSTEAD

25:24.133 --> 25:25.467
OF SITTING AT HOME NERVOUS AND

25:25.467 --> 25:26.633
SCARED.

25:26.633 --> 25:31.633
>> YEAH.

25:31.633 --> 25:34.800
WELL, I BETTER GET GOING.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.733
I'D OFFER TO STAY THE NIGHT, BUT

25:35.733 --> 25:37.067
I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTAY MY

25:37.067 --> 25:38.067
WELCOME.

25:38.067 --> 25:39.867
>> YOU COULDN'T, SEAN.

25:39.867 --> 25:43.067
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME.

25:43.067 --> 25:43.767
>> YEAH?

25:43.767 --> 25:45.967
>> MM-HMM.

25:51.600 --> 25:52.867
>> * ALL OF THE GIRLS

25:52.867 --> 25:54.267
* UP IN THE CLUB

25:54.267 --> 25:56.067
* COME AND SHOW ME SOME LOVE

25:56.067 --> 25:57.300
* I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT

25:57.300 --> 25:59.067
>> I WAS JUST SO BLOWN AWAY.

25:59.067 --> 26:00.100
I HAD TO CATCH UP TO WHERE SEAN

26:00.100 --> 26:02.167
WAS, BUT NOW I'M READY TO GIVE

26:02.167 --> 26:04.067
US A REAL CHANCE.

26:04.067 --> 26:04.867
>> EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN A FAN

26:04.867 --> 26:06.367
OF MALCOLM'S, THE MOST IMPORTANT

26:06.367 --> 26:07.967
THING TO ME IS THAT YOU'RE

26:07.967 --> 26:09.067
HAPPY.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.367
>> OOH.

26:10.367 --> 26:11.400
>> CAN I LEAVE A LITTLE EARLY

26:11.400 --> 26:12.667
TODAY?

26:12.667 --> 26:13.667
I HAVE TO SWING BY THE DRY

26:13.667 --> 26:14.533
CLEANER'S TO PICK UP MY SEXY

26:14.533 --> 26:15.667
DRESS.

26:15.667 --> 26:16.500
PEARCE IS TAKING ME TO HIS

26:16.500 --> 26:17.567
FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

26:17.567 --> 26:19.067
IT'S FANCY.

26:19.067 --> 26:20.067
>> OH.

26:20.067 --> 26:21.067
>> WHO AM I TO STAND IN THE WAY

26:21.067 --> 26:22.267
OF YOUNG LOVE?

26:22.267 --> 26:23.400
OR IS IT OLD LOVE?

26:23.400 --> 26:24.300
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

26:24.300 --> 26:25.867
IF I AVERAGE YOUR AGES, THEN I

26:25.867 --> 26:27.733
GUESS IT'S MIDDLE-AGED LOVE.

26:27.733 --> 26:28.667
[laughs]

26:28.667 --> 26:29.400
>> WHO CARES?

26:29.400 --> 26:30.767
PEARCE IS FINE AND COMFORTABLY

26:30.767 --> 26:32.067
RETIRED.

26:32.067 --> 26:34.067
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

26:34.067 --> 26:35.067
>> OOH.

26:35.067 --> 26:36.100
>> REALLY?

26:36.100 --> 26:37.500
YOU ALL GAVE ME SERIOUS GRIEF

26:37.500 --> 26:38.900
FOR DATING A YOUNGER GUY.

26:38.900 --> 26:40.433
WHY IS NOBODY BATTING AN EYE NOW

26:40.433 --> 26:42.600
THAT MORGAN'S DATING METHUSELAH?

26:42.600 --> 26:44.333
>> OH, RAQUEL, AFTER THE JOKES,

26:44.333 --> 26:45.767
WE DID SUPPORT YOU.

26:45.767 --> 26:46.733
BUT WE ALL KNOW RELATIONSHIPS

26:46.733 --> 26:48.200
USUALLY WORK BETTER WHEN THE MAN

26:48.200 --> 26:49.300
IS OLDER.

26:49.300 --> 26:51.067
>> OH, AND WHERE DID YOU DO YOUR

26:51.067 --> 26:52.367
RESEARCH, DOCTOR?

26:52.367 --> 26:53.267
>> THINK ABOUT IT.

26:53.267 --> 26:54.467
MOST WOMEN WANT A GUY WHO'S

26:54.467 --> 26:56.233
MATURE, SETTLED, AND A GOOD

26:56.233 --> 26:57.300
PROVIDER.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.500
AND THAT'S USUALLY SOMEONE WHO'S

26:58.500 --> 26:59.633
OLDER.

26:59.633 --> 27:01.433
>> AND MOST MEN, STRAIGHT MEN,

27:01.433 --> 27:03.600
WANT A WOMAN WHO IS NUBILE,

27:03.600 --> 27:05.367
SEXY, AND TROPHY WORTHY.

27:05.367 --> 27:06.067
AND THAT WOMAN IS USUALLY

27:06.067 --> 27:07.600
YOUNGER.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.300
>> RAQUEL'S RIGHT, THOUGH.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.767
IT'S STILL A DOUBLE STANDARD.

27:10.767 --> 27:12.167
>> YEAH, IT'S NOT FAIR THAT

27:12.167 --> 27:13.400
WOMEN WHO DATE YOUNGER MEN ARE

27:13.400 --> 27:15.233
CALLED COUGARS, BUT MEN WHO DATE

27:15.233 --> 27:16.367
YOUNGER WOMEN ARE JUST CALLED

27:16.367 --> 27:17.133
MEN.

27:17.133 --> 27:18.433
>> LOOK, IT WAS YOU WHO

27:18.433 --> 27:19.967
ULTIMATELY HAD A PROBLEM WITH

27:19.967 --> 27:20.967
ROBBING THE CRADLE.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.333
EVIDENTLY, MORGAN IS MORE

27:22.333 --> 27:23.867
SECURE.

27:23.867 --> 27:24.667
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM

27:24.667 --> 27:26.133
ROBBING THE GRAVE.

27:26.133 --> 27:28.400
[laughter]

27:28.400 --> 27:29.700
>> HEY, AS LONG AS HE CAN BRING

27:29.700 --> 27:32.700
THE FUN, I'LL BRING THE BENGAY.

27:32.700 --> 27:33.700
>> WELL, TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,

27:33.700 --> 27:36.633
YOU MIGHT WANT TO LEARN CPR TOO.

27:36.633 --> 27:38.067
>> OOH!

27:38.067 --> 27:39.067
>> WOW.

27:39.067 --> 27:43.300
[laughter]

27:43.300 --> 27:45.200
>> all: HEY.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.933
>> WHAT'S UP?

27:46.933 --> 27:48.233
>> RAQUEL, IT IS TRULY AN HONOR

27:48.233 --> 27:49.100
FOR YOU TO EVEN CONSIDER MY

27:49.100 --> 27:49.967
DESIGNS.

27:49.967 --> 27:50.867
>> MY PLEASURE.

27:50.867 --> 27:57.067
LET'S GO BACK TO MY OFFICE.

27:57.067 --> 27:58.700
>> I REALLY LIKE THIS GUY.

27:58.700 --> 28:00.800
I HOPE SHE DOESN'T BLOW THIS.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.067
>> OH, RELAX.

28:02.067 --> 28:02.867
I'M SURE SHE'LL LEAVE THAT

28:02.867 --> 28:05.967
PLEASURE TO YOU.

28:17.367 --> 28:19.367
[phone chimes]

28:44.733 --> 28:46.367
>> OMAR, BRANDON'S SCARVES HAVE

28:46.367 --> 28:50.967
FOUND A NEW HOME AT INDULGENCE.

28:50.967 --> 28:53.833
>> CONGRATULATIONS!

28:53.833 --> 28:54.500
>> THANKS, MAN.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.200
IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED

28:55.200 --> 28:55.867
WITHOUT YOU.

28:55.867 --> 28:56.600
>> SO, I'M STILL SEEING YOU

28:56.600 --> 28:57.333
TONIGHT FOR DINNER AT MY PLACE,

28:57.333 --> 28:58.633
RIGHT?

28:58.633 --> 28:59.867
I'VE GOT THE MUSIC; YOU BRING

28:59.867 --> 29:01.067
THE WINE.

29:01.067 --> 29:01.933
>> YOU DO KNOW I'M NOT GAY,

29:01.933 --> 29:03.600
RIGHT?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.067
>> WHAT?

29:05.067 --> 29:06.267
NO.

29:06.267 --> 29:07.133
ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T.

29:07.133 --> 29:07.933
>> IT'S COOL, MAN.

29:07.933 --> 29:09.267
I'M NOT OFFENDED.

29:09.267 --> 29:10.067
BUT I GOT TO GO.

29:10.067 --> 29:17.100
I GOT AN ORDER TO FILL.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.367
>> * ANOTHER DAY IS DONE

29:18.367 --> 29:20.800
>> [laughs]

29:20.800 --> 29:22.933
THANKS AGAIN FOR DINNER AND FOR

29:22.933 --> 29:25.367
WINNING ME THE PANDA.

29:25.367 --> 29:27.233
>> ONLY COST ME $50 IN TOKENS

29:27.233 --> 29:29.333
AND ABOUT HALF OF MY PRIDE.

29:29.333 --> 29:30.700
[both laugh]

29:30.700 --> 29:32.533
>> I ADMIRE YOUR PERSISTENCE,

29:32.533 --> 29:34.700
BUT FLASHING THE BADGE WAS A BIT

29:34.700 --> 29:35.467
MUCH.

29:35.467 --> 29:39.167
[laughter]

29:39.167 --> 29:40.300
>> OH.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.167
>> OH, I WISH TONIGHT DIDN'T

29:41.167 --> 29:43.267
HAVE TO END.

29:55.067 --> 29:56.233
>> I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT YOUR

29:56.233 --> 29:58.967
LIPS TASTE LIKE.

30:07.967 --> 30:10.867
>> HE WAS SO PATIENT AND

30:10.867 --> 30:12.133
SENSUAL.

30:12.133 --> 30:13.667
HE TOOK HIS TIME AND SAVORED ME

30:13.667 --> 30:15.567
LIKE A FINE WINE.

30:15.567 --> 30:16.533
I FELT LIKE WE COULD'VE GONE ON

30:16.533 --> 30:18.133
LIKE THAT ALL NIGHT.

30:18.133 --> 30:19.900
>> IT'S CALLED CIALIS.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.367
IT'S PRESSURE MEDICATION.

30:21.367 --> 30:22.433
DON'T YOU ALL WATCH COMMERCIALS?

30:22.433 --> 30:24.100
>> WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX, DIRTY.

30:24.100 --> 30:25.367
I SAID IT WAS A MAKE-OUT

30:25.367 --> 30:27.133
SESSION.

30:27.133 --> 30:28.367
>> SOUNDS BORING.

30:28.367 --> 30:29.467
>> SOUNDS DIVINE.

30:29.467 --> 30:31.533
MOST MEN JUST BARELY KISS YOU,

30:31.533 --> 30:32.933
THEN TRY TO GET YOUR CLOTHES

30:32.933 --> 30:33.767
OFF.

30:33.767 --> 30:35.167
>> NOT PEARCE.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.300
IT'S KIND OF PERFECT.

30:36.300 --> 30:37.733
BECAUSE HE'S OLDER, HE'S NOT

30:37.733 --> 30:38.467
GONNA WANT TO GO OUT ALL THE

30:38.467 --> 30:39.167
TIME.

30:39.167 --> 30:40.600
AND HE'S RAISED KIDS, SO HE

30:40.600 --> 30:42.333
UNDERSTANDS MY SCHEDULE.

30:42.333 --> 30:43.633
THIS COULD REALLY WORK.

30:43.633 --> 30:44.467
>> I REMEMBER WHEN I THOUGHT

30:44.467 --> 30:45.367
THAT ABOUT REGGIE.

30:45.367 --> 30:46.033
>> [gasps]

30:46.033 --> 30:46.867
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU WENT TO

30:46.867 --> 30:47.867
GO MEET UP WITH HIM?

30:47.867 --> 30:49.600
>> LET'S JUST SAY I GOT MY

30:49.600 --> 30:50.433
CLOSURE.

30:50.433 --> 30:51.733
>> UH-OH.

30:51.733 --> 30:53.067
WHERE'S THE BODY, AND DO I NEED

30:53.067 --> 30:54.600
TO GET MY SHOVEL?

30:54.600 --> 30:55.733
>> I STOOD HIM UP AND THEN

30:55.733 --> 30:57.467
WATCHED FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

30:57.467 --> 30:59.033
>> AGAIN, BORING.

30:59.033 --> 30:59.800
ALL YOU DID WAS WASTE HIS TIME

30:59.800 --> 31:01.167
AND YOURS.

31:01.167 --> 31:01.933
>> OKAY.

31:01.933 --> 31:02.867
THAT'S ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT.

31:02.867 --> 31:04.633
BUT I SEE MYSELF AS AN AGENT OF

31:04.633 --> 31:06.867
KARMA WHO GAVE HIM A TASTE OF

31:06.867 --> 31:07.867
HIS OWN MEDICINE.

31:07.867 --> 31:08.633
>> GOOD FOR YOU.

31:08.633 --> 31:09.767
REVENGE MIGHT BE PETTY, BUT IT

31:09.767 --> 31:12.067
SURE CAN FEEL GOOD.

31:12.067 --> 31:14.167
>> SO DID YOU AND BRANDON

31:14.167 --> 31:17.500
CELEBRATE HIS GOOD NEWS?

31:17.500 --> 31:18.600
>> NO.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.500
IT TURNS OUT WE AREN'T

31:19.500 --> 31:20.600
COMPATIBLE.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.700
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

31:21.700 --> 31:22.867
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT

31:22.867 --> 31:23.533
IT.

31:23.533 --> 31:24.233
>> OH, IS THIS GOING TO BE A

31:24.233 --> 31:25.533
PROBLEM?

31:25.533 --> 31:27.067
>> QUESTION: DID YOU BUY HIS

31:27.067 --> 31:28.267
SCARVES BECAUSE YOU LIKED THEM

31:28.267 --> 31:30.700
OR BECAUSE I LIKED HIM?

31:30.700 --> 31:32.767
>> I LOVE THE SCARVES.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.500
BUT I COULD CANCEL THE ORDER IF

31:34.500 --> 31:35.167
YOU WANT.

31:35.167 --> 31:38.533
>> NO. FASHION FIRST.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.200
[knock at door]

32:05.533 --> 32:07.467
>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

32:14.867 --> 32:16.733
CHARLES, WHAT'S WRONG?

32:16.733 --> 32:19.433
>> WE NEED TO TALK.

32:19.433 --> 32:20.567
I'VE GOTTEN BACK WITH MY

32:20.567 --> 32:24.533
EX-GIRLFRIEND.

32:24.533 --> 32:26.400
>> WATCH CAST COMMENTARY AND

32:26.400 --> 32:27.800
>> WHAT?

32:27.800 --> 32:29.133
>> A FEW DAYS AGO, MY

32:29.133 --> 32:31.667
EX-GIRLFRIEND PADMA JUST--SHE

32:31.667 --> 32:34.400
CAME BACK INTO MY LIFE.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.533
>> PADMA?

32:36.533 --> 32:37.467
FROM INDIA?

32:37.467 --> 32:38.733
WHO'S MARRIED?

32:38.733 --> 32:39.900
>> WELL, IT WASN'T HER CHOICE.

32:39.900 --> 32:41.700
IT WAS ARRANGED BY HER PARENTS.

32:41.700 --> 32:44.433
BUT, I DON'T KNOW, SHE GOT

32:44.433 --> 32:48.067
DIVORCED RECENTLY, AND SHE

32:48.067 --> 32:52.600
TRACKED ME DOWN.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.900
>> SO NOW SHE WANTS YOU BACK?

32:54.900 --> 32:57.400
>> SHE STILL LOVES ME, AND I

32:57.400 --> 33:00.867
REALIZED THAT I NEVER STOPPED

33:00.867 --> 33:06.233
LOVING HER.

33:06.233 --> 33:07.067
>> SO, WHEN YOU SAID YOU LOVED

33:07.067 --> 33:08.167
ME, WHAT WAS THAT?

33:08.167 --> 33:11.400
>> TRUTH.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.233
I DO LOVE YOU.

33:13.233 --> 33:15.667
BUT YOU'RE NOT THERE WITH ME.

33:15.667 --> 33:17.767
AND, HONESTLY, WHO KNOWS IF

33:17.767 --> 33:19.400
YOU'LL EVER GET THERE?

33:19.400 --> 33:22.067
I NEED TO BE WITH SOMEONE WHO'S

33:22.067 --> 33:25.833
SURE.

33:25.833 --> 33:27.633
>> THIS IS--WHOA.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.767
>> HEY, MAYBE THAT'S WHY YOU AND

33:29.767 --> 33:32.667
I ALWAYS HAD TIMING ISSUES.

33:32.667 --> 33:33.933
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T MEANT TO BE

33:33.933 --> 33:36.367
TOGETHER.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.167
>> IF THAT'S WHAT YOUR HEART

33:45.167 --> 33:49.967
SAYS, THEN YOU SHOULD FOLLOW IT.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.233
>> I'M SORRY.

34:18.267 --> 34:21.067
[laughter]

34:21.067 --> 34:21.867
>> SO I HOPE YOU ARE READY TO

34:21.867 --> 34:23.333
PLAY THIS WEEKEND, BECAUSE WE

34:23.333 --> 34:25.067
CAN GO WINE TASTING OR

34:25.067 --> 34:27.233
HANG-GLIDING OR GO OUT WITH MY

34:27.233 --> 34:28.567
BUDDY AND HIS GIRL ON THEIR

34:28.567 --> 34:29.533
BOAT.

34:29.533 --> 34:31.633
YOU PICK ONE OR PICK THEM ALL.

34:31.633 --> 34:32.333
>> [laughs]

34:32.333 --> 34:32.967
>> I'M GAME.

34:32.967 --> 34:34.233
>> DAMN, I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS

34:34.233 --> 34:36.400
DATING DIDDY.

34:36.400 --> 34:37.667
UNFORTUNATELY, I CAN'T DO ANY OF

34:37.667 --> 34:38.700
THOSE THINGS.

34:38.700 --> 34:39.467
>> IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE YOU

34:39.467 --> 34:40.333
WANT TO DO?

34:40.333 --> 34:41.500
>> ACTUALLY, I NEED TO SPEND

34:41.500 --> 34:42.633
SOME TIME WITH MY DAUGHTER.

34:42.633 --> 34:43.933
I'VE BEEN AWAY TOO MUCH AS IT

34:43.933 --> 34:44.767
IS.

34:44.767 --> 34:46.400
>> OH, COME ON.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.067
NICOLE IS 16.

34:48.067 --> 34:50.100
SHE CAN HANDLE HERSELF FOR A

34:50.100 --> 34:51.067
DAY.

34:51.067 --> 34:52.200
>> I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY RAISED

34:52.200 --> 34:53.767
YOUR KIDS.

34:53.767 --> 34:55.067
PLEASE UNDERSTAND I AM STILL

34:55.067 --> 34:56.600
RAISING MINE.

34:56.600 --> 34:57.767
>> HOW ABOUT WE DISCUSS IT OVER

34:57.767 --> 34:58.733
LUNCH LATER?

34:58.733 --> 35:00.133
>> PEARCE, I CAN'T.

35:00.133 --> 35:00.967
YOU KNOW I ONLY HAVE HALF AN

35:00.967 --> 35:02.933
HOUR, AND YOU LIKE TO LINGER.

35:02.933 --> 35:03.767
>> IT'S TRUE.

35:03.767 --> 35:04.600
I DO.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.133
[laughter]

35:06.133 --> 35:07.633
SO WE'LL JUST HANG OUT AT MY

35:07.633 --> 35:09.267
FRIEND'S PARTY TONIGHT.

35:09.267 --> 35:10.967
>> I ONLY SAID MAYBE TO THAT.

35:10.967 --> 35:11.933
I NEVER CONFIRMED ANYTHING.

35:11.933 --> 35:12.967
I'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO

35:12.967 --> 35:14.100
HANDLE WHEN I GET HOME FROM

35:14.100 --> 35:15.267
WORK.

35:15.267 --> 35:17.400
>> THIS IS FRUSTRATING.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.833
>> [laughs]

35:18.833 --> 35:21.500
I'LL FIND SOME TIME FOR US SOON.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.200
>> WHEN?

35:23.200 --> 35:26.867
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT...

35:26.867 --> 35:29.067
>> LOOK, MORGAN.

35:29.067 --> 35:31.100
I'M FINANCIALLY STABLE AND MY

35:31.100 --> 35:32.067
KIDS ARE GROWN.

35:32.067 --> 35:32.833
RIGHT NOW, I JUST WANT TO HAVE

35:32.833 --> 35:33.567
FUN.

35:33.567 --> 35:34.333
BUT I DON'T WANT TO RUN AROUND

35:34.333 --> 35:36.500
WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF WOMEN.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.467
NOW I WAS HOPING THAT I COULD

35:38.467 --> 35:40.900
FIND ONE WHO I COULD SPEND ALL

35:40.900 --> 35:42.133
MY TIME WITH.

35:42.133 --> 35:43.200
>> AS LONG AS MY BABY IS UNDER

35:43.200 --> 35:44.867
MY ROOF AND I WORK FOR A LIVING,

35:44.867 --> 35:48.500
I CAN'T BE THAT GIRL.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.600
PEARCE...

35:50.600 --> 35:52.533
I THINK I MAY BE TOO OLD FOR

35:52.533 --> 35:53.467
YOU.

35:53.467 --> 35:55.767
>> [laughs]

35:55.767 --> 35:58.667
MORGAN, MY DEAR, I THINK YOU MAY

35:58.667 --> 36:00.733
BE RIGHT.

36:33.533 --> 36:35.767
>> PEARCE AND I JUST BROKE UP.

36:35.767 --> 36:36.833
>> [scoffs]

36:36.833 --> 36:37.867
WHAT'D HE DO, GET BACK WITH HIS

36:37.867 --> 36:38.533
EX?

36:38.533 --> 36:41.067
>> [scoffs] NO.

36:41.067 --> 36:41.867
WE'RE JUST IN TWO DIFFERENT

36:41.867 --> 36:43.633
PLACES IN OUR LIVES.

36:43.633 --> 36:45.867
ARE YOU OKAY?

36:45.867 --> 36:48.500
>> I'M FINE.

36:48.500 --> 36:52.333
>> [sighs]

36:52.333 --> 36:53.067
>> OH, HEY, MAN.

36:53.067 --> 36:54.067
>> HEY, I NEED TO HOLLER AT YOU

36:54.067 --> 36:54.767
FOR A MINUTE.

36:54.767 --> 36:55.533
>> CAN YOU MAKE IT QUICK?

36:55.533 --> 36:56.400
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE

36:56.400 --> 36:57.100
FOR THE BOSS.

36:57.100 --> 36:57.967
>> ACTUALLY, I'VE BEEN FEELING

36:57.967 --> 36:59.533
REALLY STUPID, THINKING I MADE A

36:59.533 --> 37:01.400
LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT YOU.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.200
AND THEN IT HIT ME, I'M NOT

37:03.200 --> 37:04.100
STUPID.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.233
YOU PLAYED ME TO GET WHAT YOU

37:05.233 --> 37:06.400
WANTED.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.567
>> PLAYED YOU? HOW?

37:08.567 --> 37:09.400
>> BY MAKING IT SEEM LIKE YOU

37:09.400 --> 37:10.667
WERE ATTRACTED TO ME.

37:10.667 --> 37:11.467
WITH ALL THE FLIRTING, THE

37:11.467 --> 37:12.967
TOUCHING, THE DANCING.

37:12.967 --> 37:14.433
ADMIT IT, YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.067
>> OKAY, MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE

37:16.067 --> 37:17.667
EXTRA FRIENDLY.

37:17.667 --> 37:18.467
BUT I NEVER PROMISED YOU

37:18.467 --> 37:19.400
ANYTHING.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.567
>> IN MY BOOK, PRETENDING TO BE

37:21.567 --> 37:23.067
GAY WHEN YOU'RE NOT IS JUST AS

37:23.067 --> 37:24.400
BAD AS PRETENDING TO BE STRAIGHT

37:24.400 --> 37:25.233
WHEN YOU'RE NOT.

37:25.233 --> 37:26.100
YOU CAN TRY AND PASS IT OFF AS

37:26.100 --> 37:27.433
SOME BUSINESS TECHNIQUE, BUT

37:27.433 --> 37:28.800
IT'S JUST SCANDALOUS.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.833
>> OMAR, I THINK YOU'LL GET PAST

37:30.833 --> 37:31.767
ALL THIS ONCE YOU SEE YOUR FIRST

37:31.767 --> 37:33.533
COMMISSION CHECK FROM MY STUFF.

37:33.533 --> 37:36.233
SO, NO HARM, NO FOUL, OKAY?

37:36.233 --> 37:37.700
>> WRONG.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.133
I'M CANCELING YOUR ORDER.

37:39.133 --> 37:40.367
>> YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

37:40.367 --> 37:41.467
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED MY STUFF.

37:41.467 --> 37:42.933
>> I ALSO LOVE OMAR, AND I'M NOT

37:42.933 --> 37:44.633
HELPING SOMEONE WHO USED HIM.

37:44.633 --> 37:48.067
THAT'S NOT HOW I DO BUSINESS.

37:55.967 --> 37:57.933
>> * THIS AIN'T A GOOD TIME *

37:57.933 --> 37:59.467
>> [laughs]

37:59.467 --> 38:00.633
>> HEY.

38:00.633 --> 38:01.433
ARE YOU READY FOR DRINKS?

38:01.433 --> 38:02.967
>> YEAH.

38:02.967 --> 38:04.233
DEFINITELY.

38:04.233 --> 38:05.467
>> SO HOW DID THE BIRTHDAY

38:05.467 --> 38:06.567
CELEBRATION GO?

38:06.567 --> 38:07.367
>> YEAH.

38:07.367 --> 38:08.500
DID CHARLES LOVE THE GUITAR?

38:08.500 --> 38:10.967
>> NO, CHARLES LOVES SOME BITCH

38:10.967 --> 38:12.067
NAMED PADMA.

38:12.067 --> 38:13.767
>> WHAT?

38:13.767 --> 38:14.900
>> CHARLES IS GETTING BACK WITH

38:14.900 --> 38:17.433
HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND.

38:17.433 --> 38:18.367
>> DID HE NOT JUST SAY HE LOVED

38:18.367 --> 38:20.967
YOU NO LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO?

38:20.967 --> 38:22.100
>> DAMN!

38:22.100 --> 38:23.300
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND MEN.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.100
>> LOOK, I'LL BE FINE.

38:25.100 --> 38:26.800
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY IT WASN'T

38:26.800 --> 38:27.967
MEANT TO BE.

38:27.967 --> 38:29.233
IF HE REALLY LOVED ME, HE WOULD

38:29.233 --> 38:30.833
HAVE WAITED FOR ME TO FEEL THE

38:30.833 --> 38:34.667
SAME WAY.

38:34.667 --> 38:37.433
LIKE SEAN DID FOR YOU.

38:37.433 --> 38:38.700
>> * YOU CAN HURT ME TOMORROW

38:38.700 --> 38:40.200
* YOU CAN HURT ME TOMORROW

38:40.200 --> 38:41.600
* CAN HURT ME TOMORROW

38:41.600 --> 38:45.500
* GIRL, SAVE IT FOR TOMORROW

38:45.500 --> 38:47.500
[knock at door]

38:54.767 --> 38:56.467
>> APRIL, OPEN UP.

38:56.467 --> 38:57.767
[knock at door]

38:57.767 --> 39:01.700
PLEASE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

39:01.700 --> 39:06.900
PLEASE.

39:06.900 --> 39:07.567
>> WHAT?

39:07.567 --> 39:09.267
>> I'M SORRY.

39:09.267 --> 39:11.067
FOR EVERYTHING.

39:11.067 --> 39:12.067
I FREAKED OUT.

39:12.067 --> 39:13.867
WE WERE MOVING SO FAST.

39:13.867 --> 39:15.300
>> NOT AS FAST AS YOU RAN OUT

39:15.300 --> 39:16.600
INTO THAT TORNADO.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.767
>> LET ME EXPLAIN.

39:17.767 --> 39:18.700
ON MY WAY TO PICK YOU UP THAT

39:18.700 --> 39:20.067
NIGHT, I GOT A CALL.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.467
SOME INVESTORS IN NEW YORK

39:21.467 --> 39:23.500
OFFERED ME A CHANCE TO OWN A

39:23.500 --> 39:24.733
CLUB THERE.

39:24.733 --> 39:25.933
>> IF I WASN'T SO PISSED OFF

39:25.933 --> 39:27.167
RIGHT NOW, I WOULD CONGRATULATE

39:27.167 --> 39:28.567
YOU, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S

39:28.567 --> 39:30.833
REALLY A BIG THING.

39:30.833 --> 39:31.633
WHY ARE YOU EVEN TELLING ME

39:31.633 --> 39:32.600
THIS, REGGIE?

39:32.600 --> 39:33.467
>> BECAUSE TAKING IT MEANT

39:33.467 --> 39:34.900
LEAVING ATLANTA, WHICH MEANT

39:34.900 --> 39:37.067
LEAVING YOU.

39:37.067 --> 39:38.500
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.400
>> UNTIL YOU DECIDED TO DUMP ME.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.100
>> NO.

39:41.100 --> 39:41.933
I HANDLED IT COMPLETELY WRONG,

39:41.933 --> 39:43.633
BUT I'VE REALIZED HOW MUCH I

39:43.633 --> 39:45.567
NEED YOU.

39:45.567 --> 39:46.700
AND I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT AT

39:46.700 --> 39:48.467
LUNCH, BUT WE BOTH KNOW HOW THAT

39:48.467 --> 39:49.400
TURNED OUT.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.267
>> SO WHAT?

39:51.267 --> 39:52.167
NOW, AFTER ALL YOU'VE PUT ME

39:52.167 --> 39:53.433
THROUGH, YOU'RE TRYING TO GET

39:53.433 --> 39:54.500
