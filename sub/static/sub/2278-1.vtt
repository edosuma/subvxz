02:31.500 --> 02:32.536
Ten more minutes.

02:33.660 --> 02:35.194
Are you ready?

02:38.419 --> 02:40.721
Get the fuck out of here!

02:51.699 --> 02:53.885
Stop! Nyet! Nyet! Nyet!

02:55.220 --> 02:57.253
"Jrabbren"

02:57.380 --> 02:58.301
I said "krabren".

02:58.380 --> 02:59.301
No! No!

03:00.782 --> 03:03.390
Jrabbren.

03:03.540 --> 03:04.576
J-j-j--
I can't say that shit!

03:04.700 --> 03:05.966
Hey, Phil!

03:06.101 --> 03:07.291
How many times we got
to go through that?

03:07.381 --> 03:10.526
Could we just change
that last line?

03:18.380 --> 03:19.799
We'll have to do it again.

03:20.940 --> 03:22.628
Man, fuck this shit!

03:23.741 --> 03:24.930
Hold on.

03:25.021 --> 03:28.051
George... Listen to me.

03:28.221 --> 03:30.638
You're not the champ anymore,
you understand me?

03:30.780 --> 03:34.118
In fact, right now
all you are is broke.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.950
Now, we traveled a long way.

03:36.061 --> 03:37.864
I'm trying to get you
back on your feet.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.435
I'm trying to get you paid.

03:40.580 --> 03:41.731
So do me this favor.

03:41.860 --> 03:42.781
Please, just do what he asks.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.166
Let's give it another shot, huh?

03:44.261 --> 03:45.220
- But listen--
- No, no, no.

03:45.261 --> 03:46.565
No "but listen".

03:46.660 --> 03:48.425
You just do your job, we smile...

03:48.540 --> 03:51.187
go out to dinner with
these corporate cocksuckers...

03:51.341 --> 03:53.259
and you go home a richer man.

04:25.101 --> 04:28.054
# Money, money, money #

04:44.141 --> 04:45.100
Whoa.

04:50.420 --> 04:51.341
Hmm.

04:51.460 --> 04:52.726
Oops!

04:54.821 --> 04:57.890
Our customers are very excited.

04:58.061 --> 04:59.864
When the hell does
the fight start?

04:59.980 --> 05:01.591
It should start any second.

05:02.660 --> 05:03.658
What are we giving?

05:04.741 --> 05:07.618
The bets from the clubs
are 5 to 1, Boyka.

05:09.821 --> 05:13.120
Markov says this, uh, new fighter
is extremely good.

05:13.341 --> 05:15.374
Heard that one before.

05:16.661 --> 05:19.577
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

05:21.262 --> 05:23.985
Boyka! Boyka!
Boyka! Boyka!

05:30.621 --> 05:33.229
Boyka, Boyka!

05:53.261 --> 05:56.560
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:56.781 --> 05:59.275
Broadcasting
live and exclusively...

05:59.422 --> 06:02.606
to select establishments
across Russia and Europe.

06:02.781 --> 06:04.853
In this evening's bout...

06:04.981 --> 06:07.321
weighing in at 104 kilos...

06:07.502 --> 06:10.647
fighting out of Kyrov
penitentiary in Siberia...

06:10.821 --> 06:13.929
with a record of 14 wins
and no defeats...

06:14.101 --> 06:17.055
convicted of
second degree homicide...

06:17.261 --> 06:19.256
our challenger...

06:19.381 --> 06:22.335
Arkady Daviiiic!

06:25.302 --> 06:28.754
And defending
his unbeaten run...

06:29.020 --> 06:32.779
of 34 consecutive fights
without defeat...

06:32.941 --> 06:36.202
convicted of 3 counts of
homicide in the first degree...

06:36.381 --> 06:38.836
weighing in at 92 kilos...

06:38.981 --> 06:41.819
our own undisputed champion...

06:41.940 --> 06:46.697
Uri Boyka!
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

06:46.940 --> 06:50.661
Boyka, Boyka!

06:50.861 --> 06:53.700
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

06:55.022 --> 06:56.786
Boyka, Boyka!

06:56.902 --> 06:59.779
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

07:44.822 --> 07:46.701
Gentlemen, remember...

07:46.822 --> 07:49.430
no biting, no eye gouging,
and no hair pulling.

07:50.542 --> 07:51.808
Fight!

07:56.502 --> 07:57.422
Uh!

07:57.502 --> 07:58.422
Unh! Ah!

07:58.502 --> 07:59.921
- Uh! Argh!
- Ah!

08:01.662 --> 08:03.081
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

08:04.182 --> 08:05.601
- Ha!
- Unh!

08:06.701 --> 08:07.622
Argh!

08:09.622 --> 08:11.386
- Argh!
- Boyka!

08:15.221 --> 08:16.909
Aaah!

08:17.021 --> 08:18.095
Uh!

08:18.862 --> 08:20.511
Ugh! Uh!

08:22.021 --> 08:23.479
Uh!

08:25.102 --> 08:27.212
Argh!

08:29.422 --> 08:30.611
Argh!

08:30.701 --> 08:31.660
Unh! Oh!

08:31.702 --> 08:32.660
Bah!

08:33.981 --> 08:35.284
Boyka, Boyka!

08:35.381 --> 08:37.376
Boyka, Boyka!

08:39.059 --> 08:40.288
To success!

08:48.902 --> 08:49.861
Here he is.

08:49.902 --> 08:51.206
Excuse me.

08:55.862 --> 08:58.317
George, you are an hour
late for the dinner.

08:58.462 --> 09:00.495
Oh, my bad. I forgot
all about this dinner.

09:00.621 --> 09:01.964
Mr. Chambers.

09:02.062 --> 09:04.249
The ad execs are
getting pissed off.

09:04.382 --> 09:06.415
Come in. Have a drink. We'll go.

09:06.541 --> 09:07.462
All right.
Let me change clothes.

09:07.582 --> 09:08.771
- Gimme 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes?

09:08.862 --> 09:10.128
On top of an hour?

09:10.222 --> 09:12.024
Hey, listen, this brown nosing
and breaking bread bullshit--

09:12.142 --> 09:13.791
That's your job.
I did mine already.

09:13.902 --> 09:14.861
They can kiss this ass.

09:14.941 --> 09:16.629
Tell you what, 20 minutes.

09:16.741 --> 09:18.045
Raah!

09:18.142 --> 09:19.369
Argh!

09:19.462 --> 09:20.382
Uh!

09:20.462 --> 09:21.382
Uh!

09:21.462 --> 09:22.996
Argh!

09:23.101 --> 09:24.636
Unh! Uh!

09:24.781 --> 09:25.702
Ah!

09:26.941 --> 09:28.475
Argh!

09:31.102 --> 09:32.752
- Unh!
- Yes!

09:33.822 --> 09:34.857
- Unh!
- Argh!

09:37.981 --> 09:39.285
Argh!

09:41.862 --> 09:43.512
Get up! Finish him!

09:43.623 --> 09:45.157
Now!

09:45.303 --> 09:46.530
Aaaah!

09:49.742 --> 09:51.967
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

10:16.141 --> 10:17.100
Unh!

10:18.381 --> 10:19.340
Uh! Oh!

10:19.501 --> 10:21.189
Argh!

10:23.142 --> 10:24.677
Uh! Ugh!

10:24.822 --> 10:26.280
What the fuck are
you doing in my--

10:26.422 --> 10:27.841
Ugh!

10:38.941 --> 10:40.744
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

10:40.862 --> 10:41.821
Stop!

10:41.942 --> 10:43.247
Boyka, Boyka!

10:55.022 --> 10:56.096
Argh!

10:56.182 --> 10:57.141
Uh!

10:57.182 --> 10:58.141
Argh!

10:58.182 --> 10:59.256
Unh!

11:03.463 --> 11:06.340
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

11:07.941 --> 11:09.284
Raaah!

11:10.343 --> 11:12.299
Raah!

11:12.422 --> 11:14.494
Boyka, Boyka, Boyka!

11:22.621 --> 11:23.964
There.

11:39.343 --> 11:41.607
If we cannot get
better odds against Boyka...

11:41.743 --> 11:44.236
we will have to shut down
by spring.

11:44.383 --> 11:46.454
It cannot keep
going on like this.

11:46.583 --> 11:49.459
Don't worry. It won't.

11:49.623 --> 11:53.689
They said nobody saw
these guys, George.

11:53.903 --> 11:55.783
What, they ain't got
no surveillance cameras out here?

11:55.901 --> 11:56.860
I don't know.

11:56.942 --> 11:59.051
You really don't think
I did this shit.

12:04.983 --> 12:07.860
Another easy fight, eh, champ?

12:08.062 --> 12:10.440
No one's ever
gonna stop you, huh?

12:13.302 --> 12:15.718
When you get out
of here some day...

12:15.862 --> 12:18.048
you'll be the richest man
in Kiev.

12:18.182 --> 12:19.678
I just hope
you'll remember me--

12:19.782 --> 12:21.201
Aah!

12:24.702 --> 12:25.661
It was an accident.

12:28.542 --> 12:29.769
Put out your hand.

12:30.823 --> 12:31.821
No.

12:33.662 --> 12:34.813
Boyka.

12:34.942 --> 12:35.863
Did you hear?

12:35.982 --> 12:37.133
Hear what?

12:38.463 --> 12:39.652
He is coming.

12:39.743 --> 12:42.006
The police is already
in his room.

12:42.143 --> 12:43.409
He'll be here
tomorrow.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.035
Aaah!

13:09.103 --> 13:11.097
This is your Bible?

13:13.822 --> 13:15.049
Why, yes, sir.

13:15.143 --> 13:18.058
I take the Good Book
with me everywhere I go.

13:18.223 --> 13:19.450
Mmm.

13:22.262 --> 13:24.410
That is not mine.

13:30.423 --> 13:33.492
Then this must
not be yours, too.

13:34.663 --> 13:36.121
No, it isn't.

13:40.024 --> 13:42.824
What the hell
is going on here?

13:42.983 --> 13:44.287
They're setting me up.

13:49.143 --> 13:51.904
American boxer George Chambers
has been transferred...

13:52.063 --> 13:54.825
to a maximum security
jail to await charges.

13:54.982 --> 13:58.128
Convicted of a controversial
assault charge 6 years ago...

13:58.303 --> 14:02.101
the former Heavyweight Champion
of the World was also cautioned...

14:02.303 --> 14:04.681
in 1993 over the possession
of illegal painkillers.

14:04.823 --> 14:07.201
Our sources have indicated
that the quantity...

14:07.343 --> 14:09.683
of narcotics involved
is well over the threshold...

14:09.863 --> 14:11.167
for a trafficking charge.

14:11.262 --> 14:13.909
This is Maria Alonso
reporting from Russia.

15:21.784 --> 15:23.241
He just arrived.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.839
Fuck are y'all lookin' at?

16:29.703 --> 16:30.931
Yeah.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.890
Good evening, Mr. Chambers.

16:38.024 --> 16:41.285
I trust your journey
wasn't too uncomfortable.

16:41.464 --> 16:45.415
Now, you and I both know you don't
give a damn how my journey was.

16:45.623 --> 16:47.733
I understand you have
been to prison before...

16:47.863 --> 16:49.666
in the United States.

16:51.623 --> 16:52.621
And don't pretend
that you don't know...

16:52.703 --> 16:53.739
who the hell I am, either.

16:53.823 --> 16:55.434
I was a big fan of yours...

16:55.544 --> 16:57.960
during height of your career.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.866
In fact, we all are very
excited you are here.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.406
Don't get too excited,
'cause I plan on walking...

17:02.503 --> 17:04.766
straight outta here as soon as
this shit's straightened out.

17:05.863 --> 17:07.935
Perhaps.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.328
But in the meantime...

17:09.423 --> 17:11.265
you should know that
in this facility...

17:11.383 --> 17:13.032
we think very highly of fighters.

17:13.143 --> 17:15.828
In fact, we even have
our own champion.

17:15.983 --> 17:18.247
You ain't hearing me,
Colonel Klink.

17:18.423 --> 17:20.380
I told you. I don't plan
on staying here long.

17:59.903 --> 18:02.358
Fuck y'all. Heat this shit up.

18:06.944 --> 18:09.207
You take shower now.

18:10.424 --> 18:13.646
Go...fuck...yourself.

18:16.984 --> 18:17.943
Ugh!

18:18.024 --> 18:18.983
Ugh!

18:19.065 --> 18:20.906
Argh! Ow!

18:21.984 --> 18:23.173
Ugh!

18:24.263 --> 18:25.836
Ugh!

18:39.823 --> 18:41.511
Hmm.

18:51.784 --> 18:53.894
Ha ha ha!

18:57.503 --> 19:01.147
Champ, gift from Boyka.
Warm piss.

19:01.344 --> 19:02.686
- Unh!
- Ugh!

19:02.783 --> 19:03.703
Argh!

19:06.663 --> 19:07.813
Ugh!

19:07.904 --> 19:08.940
Unh!

19:09.024 --> 19:10.635
Argh!

19:10.744 --> 19:12.087
Oh!

19:31.063 --> 19:32.329
Are you all right, chum?

19:34.024 --> 19:35.865
Turn around, get the fuck
out of my face!

19:37.464 --> 19:38.730
Got it.

19:44.663 --> 19:47.579
Ugh!
This is bullshit!

20:31.585 --> 20:34.309
I don't mean
to bother you, but...

20:34.463 --> 20:35.959
you better get up.

20:39.583 --> 20:40.964
Look, if you
don't leave your cell...

20:41.065 --> 20:44.095
when they unlock the door,
they'll lock it again.

20:44.264 --> 20:46.144
You won't eat or get air
for the rest of the day.

20:49.703 --> 20:51.736
Not that either
of those things...

20:51.904 --> 20:53.055
are particularly
pleasant out here.

20:53.184 --> 20:55.025
Yo, dude...

20:55.104 --> 20:57.022
Iet's get one thing straight.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.533
Now, I don't need to learn
the ropes around here...

21:00.664 --> 21:02.428
you feel me?

21:02.544 --> 21:04.807
Sure, Mr. Chambers.

21:04.985 --> 21:06.557
Of course.

21:53.264 --> 21:54.606
Move!

21:54.704 --> 21:56.737
Hey, man, what the fuck?
Man, you blind, too?

21:56.864 --> 21:58.322
Ignore him.

21:59.586 --> 22:00.813
He's a bit crazy.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.402
Been here too long,
you know what I mean?

22:02.544 --> 22:05.268
Lives underground. Only
comes up here at mealtimes.

22:11.904 --> 22:14.820
Not exactly five star, is it?

22:41.143 --> 22:43.982
Uh...do you mind
if I join you?

22:58.265 --> 23:00.874
Yo, dude, why do you keep
staring at me like that?

23:01.025 --> 23:03.288
I'm sorry.

23:03.426 --> 23:05.152
It's just--

23:05.264 --> 23:07.221
Well, it's incredible
that I'm sharing a cell...

23:07.385 --> 23:09.495
with George Chambers here.

23:13.945 --> 23:15.786
Steven Parker.

23:21.945 --> 23:23.403
I suggest you stand up.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.238
Unh!

23:37.464 --> 23:38.653
Look, I don't want
to be pushy, man...

23:38.745 --> 23:40.011
but you don't want
to mess with Boyka.

24:00.146 --> 24:02.102
You, stand!

24:07.746 --> 24:11.160
You stand up...now!

24:11.345 --> 24:12.304
Mmf!

24:12.464 --> 24:13.769
- Unh!
- Ugh!

24:29.785 --> 24:31.166
Boyka, huh?

24:35.704 --> 24:38.044
Now, what kind of
bitch ass name is that?

24:40.945 --> 24:43.400
You were great champion. I know.

24:43.545 --> 24:46.690
Long time ago. Long time.

24:48.065 --> 24:51.632
But in here, I am the champion.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.169
And you...

24:56.786 --> 24:57.937
You are just my bi--

25:08.706 --> 25:10.125
Raaah!

25:26.144 --> 25:27.793
Let's go, motherfucker!

25:27.905 --> 25:30.398
Bring it! Bring it!

25:30.545 --> 25:32.117
Let's go right now!

25:32.225 --> 25:33.836
Fuck you!

25:37.665 --> 25:39.007
Why did you stop me?!

25:39.104 --> 25:41.368
You think I'm afraid of
that fucking oaf?

25:42.226 --> 25:43.837
Uri, I told you you'll
have your own shot at him.

25:43.945 --> 25:46.323
I had my shot at him!

25:46.467 --> 25:48.615
And then your guards
stepped in to save him!

25:48.746 --> 25:50.012
How do you think that looks?!

25:50.145 --> 25:51.487
Look, we help.

25:51.586 --> 25:53.158
I didn't ask you.

25:56.466 --> 25:58.345
You cannot stop me from
doing what I have to do.

25:58.506 --> 26:00.501
No one wants to stop you.

26:00.665 --> 26:02.392
We're just telling you
we have to be sure...

26:02.505 --> 26:04.423
it is in the ring!

26:06.186 --> 26:07.375
Argh!

26:09.266 --> 26:10.723
Some bad news.

26:10.785 --> 26:12.435
They're not offering bail.

26:12.545 --> 26:13.849
Did you call Ruben in L.A.?

26:13.945 --> 26:16.208
George, Ruben is
an American attorney.

26:16.345 --> 26:17.573
He can't help with this.

26:17.665 --> 26:19.928
Did you even call-- Listen.

26:20.065 --> 26:23.325
You better tell me something
I wanna hear right now.

26:23.505 --> 26:24.732
I've already been
to the embassy.

26:24.826 --> 26:26.091
They're very upbeat.

26:26.225 --> 26:27.836
But they're telling me
the process can take...

26:27.985 --> 26:29.213
anywhere from a month--

26:29.344 --> 26:30.840
A month?!

26:30.946 --> 26:33.247
What the fuck
you talking about?!

26:33.386 --> 26:35.687
Now, Phil, I swear to God...

26:35.826 --> 26:37.820
you better turn around and
get me a team of lawyers...

26:37.985 --> 26:39.251
and get me
the fuck out of here!

26:39.345 --> 26:40.458
I will.

26:40.544 --> 26:42.654
It's just gonna take
a little bit more time.

26:44.105 --> 26:45.332
You fucking clown!

26:45.426 --> 26:47.881
You know what it feels like
to be in here for nothing, huh?

26:48.026 --> 26:49.484
You're bullshittin' me!

26:49.586 --> 26:52.655
Just be patient, George!
I'm doing everything I can!

26:59.666 --> 27:02.044
My dear friend, Markov.

27:02.226 --> 27:03.760
So, where are we?

27:03.906 --> 27:06.093
He's uncomfortable.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.721
That's a good first step.

27:07.865 --> 27:11.048
I don't need first steps.
I need them to fight.

27:11.226 --> 27:13.719
There's already bad blood
between him and Boyka.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.438
I think he'll--he'll-- he'll fight.

27:15.546 --> 27:16.466
- You think?
- Yeah.

27:16.546 --> 27:18.157
Well, that's a nice surprise.

27:18.264 --> 27:20.259
"Think" isn't
good enough, Markov.

27:20.385 --> 27:22.073
I have to start making
arrangements now.

27:22.185 --> 27:23.106
Eh...sure.

27:23.185 --> 27:24.451
Th-th-the only
problem is, eh,

27:24.546 --> 27:27.346
this idiot hopes
he'll go free any day.

27:27.505 --> 27:28.925
Yeah...

27:29.026 --> 27:30.752
Well, I'll handle that.

27:30.865 --> 27:32.975
You just take care
of the fight.

27:33.145 --> 27:35.025
- And Markov...
- Yeah?

27:37.905 --> 27:40.513
Don't disappoint me, ok?

27:46.706 --> 27:48.816
I said, enough!

27:48.945 --> 27:50.748
What the fuck's going on?!
Why are you doing this?!

27:54.225 --> 27:55.606
Ugh!

27:55.707 --> 27:57.510
Ow, unh!

28:14.146 --> 28:15.335
Argh!

28:16.545 --> 28:18.233
Ugh, uh!

28:19.587 --> 28:21.044
Argh!

28:21.147 --> 28:23.065
Unh!

28:23.224 --> 28:24.145
Aah!

28:25.745 --> 28:26.704
Aaargh!

28:26.745 --> 28:27.857
Ow!

28:31.066 --> 28:33.674
Ugh! Unh! Ugh!

28:33.826 --> 28:35.782
Ow!

28:52.026 --> 28:53.330
Thank you.

28:53.426 --> 28:55.344
What the hell was that about?

28:55.466 --> 28:57.231
Nothing.

28:57.346 --> 29:00.453
But thanks for
your help anyway.

29:00.626 --> 29:02.544
Well, don't take it
personally, junkie.

29:02.626 --> 29:04.812
I just don't like seeing
people getting bullied.

29:04.946 --> 29:06.864
Unless it's me
doing the bullying.

29:08.625 --> 29:10.697
Listen, Mr. Chambers...

29:10.826 --> 29:13.281
there's something you ought
to know about this place.

29:13.466 --> 29:15.998
E-even when you're getting
out any day, of course.

29:17.666 --> 29:19.660
What?

29:19.786 --> 29:21.474
It's owned by the mob.

29:21.586 --> 29:24.156
I mean...
One man, really.

29:24.306 --> 29:27.068
He owns the cons,
he owns the cops.

29:27.226 --> 29:29.336
Ha! He's name is Gaga.

29:29.466 --> 29:30.732
Ha ha ha!

29:30.865 --> 29:32.553
- Gaga?
- Yeah.

29:32.666 --> 29:33.816
So why are you telling me?

29:33.906 --> 29:36.706
Just thought it best
if--if--if--if you...

29:37.826 --> 29:39.245
If I what?

29:39.346 --> 29:40.381
Go with the program.

29:42.026 --> 29:43.483
Best way to stay healthy.

29:43.586 --> 29:45.887
Hey! I got my own way
of staying healthy.

29:46.067 --> 29:47.103
What's that?

29:47.227 --> 29:48.531
Knock the other
son of a bitch out...

29:48.668 --> 29:50.432
before he gets a chance
to do it to me.

30:05.146 --> 30:06.297
What happened?!

30:08.466 --> 30:09.655
What?!

30:15.665 --> 30:18.005
You think you come in here
and do what you want?!

30:18.146 --> 30:20.332
Fuck you! This is my world.

30:20.506 --> 30:22.155
Motherfucker,
keep your world.

30:22.306 --> 30:23.418
I don't want this shit.

30:23.506 --> 30:25.155
And anyway, why you talking
to me right now, man?

30:25.306 --> 30:27.032
Either throw your hands
or step the fuck--

30:27.147 --> 30:28.873
- If you're so tough, then fight me!
- Bitch ass motherfucker!

30:28.985 --> 30:30.366
In the ring!

30:30.465 --> 30:31.386
Man, fuck the ring!

30:31.466 --> 30:32.617
We can do this shit right now.

30:32.707 --> 30:34.855
Bitch-ass punk!

30:40.307 --> 30:42.417
Fuck you! Fight me in the ring!

30:42.547 --> 30:44.734
Right now!
I'll take you right here!

30:44.867 --> 30:46.133
- Come on!
- Come on!

30:46.226 --> 30:47.262
What you got for me?

30:47.346 --> 30:48.497
Fuck you!

30:48.586 --> 30:50.504
I'll fight you right now,
motherfucker! Come on!

30:50.627 --> 30:52.621
- In the ring!
- Fuck that!

30:54.226 --> 30:56.796
You have to concentrate
on one fight at a time.

30:56.987 --> 30:58.099
Forget the American--

30:58.226 --> 31:01.525
Shut up! Do your fucking job!

31:04.787 --> 31:07.779
Heavyweight Champion
of the World.

31:07.946 --> 31:10.133
I'll rip his fucking head off!

31:11.506 --> 31:13.041
Of course you will.

31:13.146 --> 31:15.486
But tonight you rip
someone else's head off, ok?

31:15.626 --> 31:16.969
Shut up!

31:18.825 --> 31:20.590
Boyka.

31:20.706 --> 31:22.010
So what are the bets?

31:22.145 --> 31:24.754
250,000 across
the first 3 rounds...

31:24.906 --> 31:26.862
and another 20 across 4 and 5.

31:27.065 --> 31:29.635
Could be a lot better.
Give me the phone.

31:32.266 --> 31:33.647
Markov.

31:33.746 --> 31:35.051
What the hell's going on?

31:35.147 --> 31:37.449
Fight starts in 15 minutes.

31:37.587 --> 31:39.083
I'm walking to
the arena right now.

31:39.186 --> 31:40.491
That's not what
I'm talking about.

31:40.587 --> 31:42.313
What the fuck's going
on with Chambers?

31:42.427 --> 31:44.230
We're doing everything
we can, Gaga.

31:44.346 --> 31:47.453
You better do more, my friend.
You better do more, understand?

31:47.626 --> 31:48.547
Yes.

31:48.626 --> 31:49.624
Boyka, Boyka!

31:54.427 --> 31:55.501
Fight!

31:59.786 --> 32:00.860
Unh!

32:00.986 --> 32:02.943
Unh! Ugh!

32:03.106 --> 32:04.142
Ugh!

32:04.267 --> 32:05.609
Boyka! Boyka!

32:05.706 --> 32:07.163
Raaah!

32:07.306 --> 32:09.800
Boyka! Boyka!

32:09.946 --> 32:10.867
Unh!

32:10.946 --> 32:12.634
Unh! Uh!

32:16.587 --> 32:18.466
Arghhh.

32:19.587 --> 32:20.737
Unh!

32:22.345 --> 32:24.033
Raah!

32:24.146 --> 32:25.527
Boyka!

32:26.627 --> 32:27.586
Ugh!

32:30.188 --> 32:31.377
Unh! Ah!

32:32.947 --> 32:33.906
Uh!

32:34.027 --> 32:35.907
Ow!

32:37.627 --> 32:39.506
Argh! Argh!

32:41.666 --> 32:43.162
Boyka!

32:45.508 --> 32:46.735
Unh! Ow!

32:46.827 --> 32:48.399
Argh!

32:48.506 --> 32:50.193
Ow!

32:52.106 --> 32:53.986
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

32:55.068 --> 32:57.139
Unh! Yaah!

32:57.266 --> 32:58.456
Yah!

32:58.548 --> 32:59.507
Ow!

33:01.306 --> 33:03.032
Arrrrgh!

33:03.146 --> 33:04.911
Unh! Unh!

33:06.107 --> 33:07.718
Ow!

33:10.666 --> 33:12.699
Unh!

33:13.826 --> 33:16.320
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

33:16.466 --> 33:18.154
Boyka! Boyka!

33:19.027 --> 33:20.024
Unh!

33:21.868 --> 33:23.095
Boyka! Boyka!

33:23.187 --> 33:25.029
Unh! Unh! Unh!

33:27.907 --> 33:29.173
Stop! Stop!

33:29.267 --> 33:30.648
Unh!

33:30.787 --> 33:34.354
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

33:34.548 --> 33:36.274
Argh!

33:42.228 --> 33:43.455
Argh!

33:45.866 --> 33:47.094
Unh!

34:11.107 --> 34:12.565
Warden wants to see you.

34:12.706 --> 34:15.429
Only person I wanna see
is from the U.S. embassy.

34:16.545 --> 34:18.041
You see warden now.

34:23.987 --> 34:25.408
Ugh!

34:39.068 --> 34:39.987
Motherfuck--!

34:40.068 --> 34:41.985
Ugh!

34:43.786 --> 34:44.976
That's enough.

34:47.068 --> 34:48.449
Mr. Chambers...

34:48.547 --> 34:52.996
you are making things
very difficult on yourself.

34:53.266 --> 34:57.179
There's a way you can make
your time here much easier.

34:58.507 --> 35:01.614
You've seen now
our resident champion...

35:01.787 --> 35:03.974
Uri Boyka, in action.

35:04.107 --> 35:06.524
We want to arrange a fight
between the two of you.

35:06.667 --> 35:08.163
I ain't fighting, man!

35:08.266 --> 35:10.990
I wouldn't take part in
this circus brawl bullshit...

35:11.147 --> 35:12.989
you got going on here anyway.

35:13.107 --> 35:15.140
The hell you call that shit?

35:15.267 --> 35:17.070
A sport?

35:17.189 --> 35:20.181
As I was saying,
if you fight...

35:20.428 --> 35:22.998
you'll find that
things could become...

35:23.188 --> 35:25.374
much more pleasant
around here.

35:25.507 --> 35:27.502
Who knows? You could
even find yourself...

35:27.668 --> 35:30.583
on a plane heading home.

35:33.067 --> 35:35.983
Fine. Have it your way.

35:40.587 --> 35:43.195
Sewage duct for whole prison.

35:43.348 --> 35:45.112
Very old.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.221
Clogged every day.

35:48.987 --> 35:49.907
Go!

35:50.987 --> 35:52.407
Uh, hell no!

35:53.708 --> 35:54.667
Go!

35:55.708 --> 35:57.626
Get that shit out of my face!

36:01.467 --> 36:02.848
Go get it.

36:05.387 --> 36:06.346
Fuck you!

36:14.708 --> 36:18.237
If you don't work,
then we'll make you work.

36:18.428 --> 36:19.349
Heh.

36:19.428 --> 36:20.387
What?

36:23.948 --> 36:26.096
Don't give these
gorillas an excuse.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.026
It's not worth it.

37:06.107 --> 37:08.217
Give me number.

37:08.348 --> 37:10.266
On your shovel.

37:13.147 --> 37:14.106
Eighteen.

37:16.988 --> 37:20.594
You bring it back to me
when you've finished each day.

37:20.788 --> 37:24.739
Make sure you clean the shit
before you give it back.

38:24.828 --> 38:27.513
Not bad for
an old Russian dude.

38:28.628 --> 38:30.508
I've had time to practice.

38:55.188 --> 38:57.259
Oh, Christ!

38:59.227 --> 39:01.605
Man, you truly stink.

39:02.748 --> 39:04.512
Fuck you.

39:04.629 --> 39:07.697
Maybe I should ask
for a gas mask.

39:07.868 --> 39:10.093
Or maybe transfer
to another cell.

39:10.228 --> 39:12.530
What, and miss out on
my sparkling conversation?

39:13.828 --> 39:16.552
Looks like Crot gave you
quite a hard time.

39:16.709 --> 39:17.822
Who?

39:17.908 --> 39:19.442
The guy in the wheelchair, Crot.

39:19.587 --> 39:21.812
Crot is Russian for mole.

39:21.947 --> 39:23.098
You know...

39:24.429 --> 39:27.459
that guy used to be a commando
in the Russian army.

39:27.629 --> 39:30.621
I'm told that he was quite
a mean motherfucker back then.

39:30.788 --> 39:32.246
He even killed a prison guard.

39:33.507 --> 39:34.466
That old dude?

39:34.588 --> 39:36.122
Yeah.

39:36.228 --> 39:39.412
There's no way they're gonna
let him out of this shit hole.

39:39.588 --> 39:40.700
Hmm.

39:40.788 --> 39:42.322
But you, on the other hand...

39:42.429 --> 39:45.574
you're one of the lucky few
that does have a way out.

39:45.747 --> 39:47.282
Yeah? How so?

39:48.388 --> 39:50.997
Take Markov's offer.
Fight Boyka.

40:31.709 --> 40:33.358
Jesus, don't you
guys ever sleep?

40:39.628 --> 40:40.549
Aah!

40:40.629 --> 40:42.278
Look at you, junkie fuck.

40:42.388 --> 40:44.076
C-can't--

40:44.188 --> 40:45.109
Argh!

40:45.188 --> 40:46.799
You're lucky
to still be breathing.

40:46.908 --> 40:47.982
Unh.

40:48.068 --> 40:50.868
If he doesn't fight soon,
your luck will end.

40:54.347 --> 40:56.457
Ah!

41:11.468 --> 41:13.003
We bring you a message
from Boyka.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.089
Argh!

41:18.189 --> 41:20.337
Unh! Ow!

41:22.229 --> 41:23.150
Ow!

41:23.229 --> 41:25.761
Ugh!

41:25.908 --> 41:28.056
Aah!

41:32.108 --> 41:33.028
Argh!

41:34.588 --> 41:35.969
Hey!

41:41.868 --> 41:42.788
Ugh!

41:51.108 --> 41:52.143
Argh!

41:52.228 --> 41:53.417
Ow!

41:53.507 --> 41:55.272
Unh!

41:56.389 --> 41:57.310
Oh!

41:58.949 --> 42:00.253
Uh!

42:00.389 --> 42:01.770
- Uh!
- Uh!

42:02.829 --> 42:03.750
Ow!

42:04.828 --> 42:05.979
Ow!

42:09.469 --> 42:10.658
Argh!

42:21.349 --> 42:22.308
Move.

42:23.909 --> 42:24.829
Move.

42:33.988 --> 42:35.177
Ugh!

42:38.348 --> 42:39.729
Argh!

42:39.829 --> 42:42.130
Enjoy your new home.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.249
What?

42:51.349 --> 42:53.766
He's in the hole.

42:53.950 --> 42:56.750
People change their minds
in that place.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.021
Good.

43:01.829 --> 43:02.979
Ugh.

43:03.070 --> 43:04.489
Ow!

43:28.588 --> 43:30.199
Hey.

43:30.309 --> 43:31.881
Stand up.

43:31.989 --> 43:33.792
Stand up. I have soup.

43:46.229 --> 43:48.185
Pills.

43:50.909 --> 43:52.558
Chew and swallow.

43:52.670 --> 43:54.434
Help with your fever.

43:55.990 --> 43:57.409
Why are you doing this?

43:57.508 --> 43:59.081
Shut up and drink.

44:00.188 --> 44:01.608
And take this, too.

44:07.389 --> 44:08.578
Hey.

44:12.868 --> 44:14.249
Why are you doing this?

44:14.350 --> 44:16.958
Why do you care why I do it?

44:17.149 --> 44:21.138
'Cause where I'm from,
ain't nothin' free. Why?

44:21.350 --> 44:23.076
You never help anyone?

44:26.189 --> 44:27.570
Probably not.

44:27.668 --> 44:29.510
Motherfucker,
you don't know me.

44:29.629 --> 44:31.777
That's why I bought
my mother a ten-bedroom house.

44:31.909 --> 44:33.827
I don't do for nobody, shit.

44:33.949 --> 44:36.135
You probably do
that for you, too.

44:36.268 --> 44:38.378
Hey, you know what
your problem is, old man?

44:38.508 --> 44:41.845
You been here too long.
You lost touch with reality.

44:42.068 --> 44:46.019
Your problem is that you're
not accepting reality.

44:46.229 --> 44:48.531
Reality is, I was framed.

44:48.710 --> 44:50.206
I don't belong here.

44:50.349 --> 44:52.114
And I ain't gonna
be here much longer.

44:52.229 --> 44:55.452
You still don't understand.

44:55.669 --> 44:58.316
They will never
let you out of here.

45:16.789 --> 45:18.515
Get him cleaned up.

45:52.910 --> 45:54.790
It is Beluga caviar.

45:54.949 --> 45:57.788
25,000 American
dollars per kilo.

45:57.950 --> 46:00.175
Looks like rat shit to me.

46:00.309 --> 46:02.227
Smells like it, too.

46:02.389 --> 46:04.384
Do you know who I am,
Mr. Chambers?

46:05.469 --> 46:06.581
You're the big dog, right?

46:06.669 --> 46:10.159
Yeah. I'm the big dog.

46:10.350 --> 46:12.536
Ruff! Heh.

46:12.670 --> 46:15.470
I am the big dog
that brought you here.

46:15.630 --> 46:19.083
So...Mr. Big Dog...

46:19.269 --> 46:21.187
what makes you think
I won't jump up there...

46:21.308 --> 46:22.728
and make you a dead dog?

46:22.830 --> 46:24.671
Because I know
you're not stupid.

46:30.469 --> 46:33.269
Let me explain something
to you, Mr. Chambers.

46:33.428 --> 46:35.461
I'm a business man.

46:35.590 --> 46:39.080
And, uh, this is
a business situation.

46:39.270 --> 46:40.229
Please.

46:42.830 --> 46:44.863
I brought you here.
I can let you out.

46:45.031 --> 46:47.869
The choice...is yours.

46:48.030 --> 46:50.945
You want me to fight
that clown Boyka, right?

46:51.109 --> 46:52.912
It will make me
very happy, yeah.

46:54.031 --> 46:55.411
And if I don't?

46:55.509 --> 46:56.966
Well...

46:57.070 --> 46:59.487
you could end up in this place
for a very long time.

46:59.669 --> 47:02.546
Maybe meet with an accident.
Perhaps stay forever.

47:02.750 --> 47:05.550
Well as we speak, I got
my man working on turning...

47:05.710 --> 47:08.548
this thing into the biggest
media circus you ever seen.

47:08.749 --> 47:10.935
Your man?

47:11.069 --> 47:11.989
Which one is this?

47:12.070 --> 47:13.221
My manager.

47:22.510 --> 47:23.852
Phil, what the fuck
are you doing up--

47:25.190 --> 47:27.415
Listen, George, everything
is going to be all right.

47:27.550 --> 47:29.583
Gaga here has a great plan.

47:29.709 --> 47:30.898
We're all gonna make
a ton of money.

47:32.150 --> 47:33.339
Oh, shit.

47:33.429 --> 47:35.232
They told me the whole thing
would be quick.

47:35.389 --> 47:36.617
That you'd be out in a week.

47:36.710 --> 47:41.198
The money is huge. It's what
we've been waiting for.

47:41.431 --> 47:44.116
You just need to stop being
so goddamned stubborn...

47:44.270 --> 47:45.766
and take the fight.

47:45.869 --> 47:49.705
Motherfucker! I'll kill
your motherfuckin' ass!

47:49.910 --> 47:51.751
Backstabbing son of a bitch!

47:51.870 --> 47:54.555
Don't be stupid.
Take the fight!

47:54.710 --> 47:57.549
Shut up, dead man!
Shut the fuck up!

47:57.711 --> 47:59.476
Fuck you!

48:10.110 --> 48:11.567
I have good news.

48:13.269 --> 48:14.190
Tell me.

48:14.269 --> 48:16.647
I'm so bloody excited, George.

48:16.869 --> 48:17.713
Why?

48:17.869 --> 48:19.059
Why?

48:19.150 --> 48:21.835
You're going to fight
Boyka, that's why.

48:23.350 --> 48:25.421
Hey...

48:25.589 --> 48:28.504
You don't need
a cornerman, do you?

48:28.669 --> 48:30.471
Why, you got
somebody in mind?

48:30.590 --> 48:33.006
George...

48:33.151 --> 48:34.877
I'm the only one you
can trust around here...

48:34.990 --> 48:36.947
you know that, don't you?

48:51.070 --> 48:53.832
Can I ask you something, George?

48:53.990 --> 48:55.026
What?

48:56.751 --> 48:59.666
If you got out of here...

48:59.831 --> 49:02.478
what's the first thing you'd do?

49:02.630 --> 49:05.277
You mean "when" I get
out of here, right?

49:05.430 --> 49:06.658
Of course.

49:08.990 --> 49:10.716
I don't know, Stevie.

49:13.870 --> 49:16.210
I'd try to see my wife.

49:18.469 --> 49:20.272
You're married?

49:23.990 --> 49:25.486
I like to think so.

49:27.349 --> 49:29.229
She ever visit you here?

49:29.350 --> 49:31.767
Once.

49:36.231 --> 49:38.609
She's got a boyfriend now.

49:38.752 --> 49:41.360
Commodities or something.

49:41.509 --> 49:43.044
That's messed up, Stevie.

49:45.030 --> 49:47.945
Doesn't hurt anymore.

49:48.151 --> 49:49.801
Used to, you know?

49:51.790 --> 49:52.711
Not anymore.

49:54.991 --> 49:57.177
When are you getting
out of here, man?

49:59.030 --> 50:00.296
Ohh...

50:02.991 --> 50:04.295
twelve years.

50:04.390 --> 50:06.423
Damn!

50:07.510 --> 50:09.121
Stevie...

50:09.230 --> 50:11.838
you ever think about
cleaning your shit up?

50:18.910 --> 50:20.291
What for?

50:59.990 --> 51:01.026
Wow.

51:01.150 --> 51:02.684
See, Stevie,
don't hold it like that.

51:02.790 --> 51:04.747
Hold it like this.
You hold it like this...

51:04.871 --> 51:06.022
you'll rip your shoulder
out of the socket.

51:06.110 --> 51:07.798
So hold it like that,
you got it?

51:07.909 --> 51:10.134
- I think so.
- Don't worry.

51:10.271 --> 51:12.419
All right. Jab.

51:12.550 --> 51:14.008
Cross.

51:14.110 --> 51:15.453
Jab.

51:15.550 --> 51:16.969
Cross... jab.

51:17.071 --> 51:17.991
# I'm gonna crush you #

51:18.070 --> 51:19.374
# Thank you much #

51:19.470 --> 51:21.772
# You can't compete with me,
I'm gonna flush you #

51:21.909 --> 51:24.019
# Send you out to sea,
so take a number, line 'em up #

51:24.150 --> 51:26.605
# I'll cut you down like a tree,
I'm gonna crush you #

51:26.791 --> 51:28.249
# Flatten out your brain,
gonna rush you #

51:28.391 --> 51:30.769
# You gonna get such pain,
they're gonna brush you #

51:30.951 --> 51:32.293
# Dust you off the ring #

51:32.392 --> 51:34.655
# Bow down low 'cause there
can only be one king #

51:34.790 --> 51:37.514
# I'm dropping bombs on you
like a blitzkrieg crew #

51:37.671 --> 51:40.970
# And you can't see through
the fog of this storm of power #

51:41.150 --> 51:44.142
# 'Cause I am the man
of your life's last hour #

51:44.312 --> 51:46.383
# You gonna feel my game
until you scream #

51:49.191 --> 51:50.265
Ugh.

52:10.872 --> 52:12.674
Hey. Hey.

52:12.791 --> 52:14.095
Hey!

52:14.190 --> 52:16.952
Hey!!

52:17.110 --> 52:19.680
Oh, for fuck's sake, man.

52:20.831 --> 52:22.787
I did everything
you asked, didn't I?

52:22.952 --> 52:24.947
He's going to fight.

52:25.070 --> 52:27.755
We have one more job for you.

52:27.911 --> 52:29.215
Understand?!

52:29.310 --> 52:31.804
Ha ha ha!

52:37.710 --> 52:38.631
How did I do?

52:38.711 --> 52:41.511
Not bad.

52:44.431 --> 52:46.196
Time.

52:46.351 --> 52:47.655
Let's do this.

52:50.391 --> 52:52.040
Have our friend in London...

52:52.151 --> 52:53.915
put half a million on Boyka.

52:54.031 --> 52:55.527
Boyka?

52:55.630 --> 53:00.156
But, sir, 80% of the money
coming in is on the American.

53:00.391 --> 53:01.925
Whatever you say, sir.

53:02.031 --> 53:03.143
Gentlemen!

53:03.230 --> 53:06.606
The fight you've
all been waiting for.

53:06.790 --> 53:10.703
To my right, fighting
out of the United States...

53:10.951 --> 53:13.866
with a record of 38 victories...

53:14.071 --> 53:16.756
and no defeats...

53:16.910 --> 53:18.445
George...

53:18.591 --> 53:21.775
Iceman Chambeeeers!

53:28.832 --> 53:29.944
And to my left...

53:30.030 --> 53:33.521
a man who needs no introduction.

53:33.711 --> 53:36.282
Our...own...

53:36.432 --> 53:38.925
undisputed champion...

53:39.112 --> 53:40.685
Uri...

53:40.831 --> 53:41.944
Boyka!

53:42.071 --> 53:44.295
Boyka! Boyka!

53:44.470 --> 53:46.235
Boyka! Boyka!

53:46.351 --> 53:50.149
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

53:53.270 --> 53:54.920
Boyka! Boyka!

53:58.910 --> 54:01.557
Gentlemen, remember...

54:01.711 --> 54:06.084
no biting, no eye gouging,
and no hair pulling.

54:06.311 --> 54:08.190
I'll beat you at your own game.

54:08.310 --> 54:10.112
Fists only.

54:10.231 --> 54:12.226
Just don't bleed on me too much.

54:12.351 --> 54:14.307
Fight!

54:27.072 --> 54:29.220
Boyka! Boyka!

54:30.591 --> 54:31.550
Uh! Uh! Uh!

54:37.152 --> 54:39.990
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

54:41.592 --> 54:43.203
- Unh! Unh!
- Ah!

54:47.750 --> 54:50.320
Kill him! Come on!
Come on! Kill him!

55:06.991 --> 55:09.830
Unh! Unh! Unh! Unh!

55:09.990 --> 55:11.563
Ow!

55:14.471 --> 55:15.699
Mmf! Uh! Uh!

55:15.792 --> 55:16.713
Unh!

55:16.791 --> 55:18.402
Keep your hands up!

55:18.471 --> 55:19.430
Unh!

55:19.512 --> 55:20.509
Ugh!

55:26.512 --> 55:28.161
Ugh!

55:29.352 --> 55:30.273
Unh!

55:31.752 --> 55:32.826
Ugh!

55:38.752 --> 55:39.711
Oh!

55:42.312 --> 55:43.309
One!

55:43.391 --> 55:46.153
Two!

55:46.311 --> 55:48.881
Three!

55:49.031 --> 55:50.412
Four!

55:50.512 --> 55:52.084
Argh!

55:52.192 --> 55:53.112
Hey!

56:05.391 --> 56:08.575
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

56:08.753 --> 56:10.939
Boyka! Boyka!

56:14.751 --> 56:15.672
Argh!

56:15.752 --> 56:16.788
Boyka! Boyka!

56:16.912 --> 56:19.559
Yaah! Yaah! Yaah!

56:19.712 --> 56:21.477
- Ugh!
- Argh!

56:21.553 --> 56:23.240
- Unh!
- Yah!

56:27.752 --> 56:29.057
Ow!

56:36.032 --> 56:37.451
Yaah! Ugh! Ugh!

56:39.951 --> 56:41.102
Argh!

57:00.752 --> 57:01.865
Ugh!

57:11.153 --> 57:12.879
Towel.

57:16.751 --> 57:18.017
Bucket.

57:20.952 --> 57:22.256
Water.

57:23.512 --> 57:24.854
Come on, Stevie!

57:32.512 --> 57:33.624
Argh!

57:47.632 --> 57:49.128
Boyka! Boyka!

57:51.672 --> 57:53.667
Fight!

57:56.831 --> 57:58.366
- Unh!
- Yaah!

58:03.753 --> 58:05.325
Ugh!

58:05.432 --> 58:06.889
Boyka! Boyka!

58:09.512 --> 58:10.433
Unh!

58:10.552 --> 58:11.434
Ugh, uh!

58:11.552 --> 58:12.434
Ow!

58:19.432 --> 58:21.388
Ugh!

58:21.512 --> 58:22.433
Uh!

58:22.511 --> 58:24.851
Boyka! Boyka!

58:27.513 --> 58:30.083
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

58:37.232 --> 58:40.416
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

58:50.032 --> 58:51.336
Uh!

59:05.393 --> 59:06.505
Ugh!

59:14.112 --> 59:15.033
What happened?

59:17.513 --> 59:19.162
You were drugged.

59:21.872 --> 59:22.984
Stevie.

59:24.192 --> 59:26.225
That motherfucker!

59:38.591 --> 59:40.394
That's your ass, Stevie.

59:40.512 --> 59:42.161
You son of a bitch!

01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:04.197
Stevie!

01:00:13.272 --> 01:00:15.152
Oh...Ugh.

01:00:15.313 --> 01:00:16.694
Man!

01:00:24.113 --> 01:00:25.877
Goddamn it, Stevie.

01:00:33.072 --> 01:00:34.300
You fuckin' pussy, get up!

01:00:38.072 --> 01:00:39.261
I am pussy?

01:00:39.352 --> 01:00:40.272
Ha ha ha!

01:00:40.352 --> 01:00:42.346
I am pussy?
Look at your face!

01:00:42.512 --> 01:00:44.238
You are a fuckin' pussy.

01:00:44.353 --> 01:00:46.539
That fight was bullshit
and you know it.

01:00:46.673 --> 01:00:48.782
You had Stevie drug me,
and that's how you won.

01:00:55.513 --> 01:00:58.313
I am the best fighter
in the world.

01:00:58.473 --> 01:01:01.350
I do not need your junkie
friend to help me win.

01:01:01.553 --> 01:01:04.200
Can you believe
this fuckin' American?

01:01:04.392 --> 01:01:07.614
You drug your opponents and
you call yourself a fighter?

01:01:07.792 --> 01:01:09.710
I do not know what
you're talking about.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.674
You make big excuse
because you lose!

01:01:12.792 --> 01:01:14.710
You should be happy
I did not finish you.

01:01:14.833 --> 01:01:17.748
You guys can't get
enough of each other.

01:01:24.393 --> 01:01:26.426
Move over back to your cell.

01:01:26.552 --> 01:01:28.777
Man, fuck you!
You said I'd get out.

01:01:29.992 --> 01:01:31.872
I know nothing about
this arrangement, George,

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:34.179
but surely, I'll look into it.

01:01:34.312 --> 01:01:36.153
You lying mother--!

01:01:36.273 --> 01:01:37.232
Ow!

01:01:38.672 --> 01:01:40.974
You told me I was gonna
get out of here! Get off me! Get off!

01:01:41.112 --> 01:01:42.071
To the pole!

01:01:48.393 --> 01:01:50.617
Ugh! I'm gonna
have your ass, punk!

01:01:50.754 --> 01:01:52.250
I'm gonna have
your ass, punk!

01:01:52.353 --> 01:01:55.345
Wait till I get outta here!
Yeah, you, punk! You!

01:01:56.712 --> 01:01:58.592
Markov!
You motherfuck--!

01:01:58.754 --> 01:02:01.285
You understand
what I'm--unh!

01:02:01.434 --> 01:02:02.354
You--! Unh!

01:02:02.433 --> 01:02:03.353
Ow!

01:02:03.433 --> 01:02:04.890
Ow! Ugh!

01:02:06.233 --> 01:02:08.266
There's a rumor.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:11.962
The American was given a bottle
of water with something in it.

01:02:12.153 --> 01:02:15.260
I'm told you know
something about it.

01:02:17.113 --> 01:02:19.645
Boyka...no.

01:02:20.753 --> 01:02:21.673
Is it true?

01:02:23.633 --> 01:02:24.861
Answer him.

01:02:24.913 --> 01:02:26.524
But--

01:02:27.713 --> 01:02:29.363
Look at this!

01:02:29.473 --> 01:02:30.509
Look!

01:02:31.912 --> 01:02:32.909
Egyptians!

01:02:32.993 --> 01:02:35.716
Greeks! Asians!
American boxers!

01:02:35.912 --> 01:02:38.405
All made fighting
into a science.

01:02:38.593 --> 01:02:39.859
Ugh!

01:02:39.913 --> 01:02:42.329
I am the next stage.

01:02:42.513 --> 01:02:43.741
And you think I need you...

01:02:43.832 --> 01:02:46.709
to drug my opponents?

01:03:03.193 --> 01:03:05.955
Wipe this fuckin' trash
off my floor.

01:03:23.713 --> 01:03:25.439
Listen.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:28.352
I was wondering when you're
planning on releasing him.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:31.275
I mean, since the deal is done.

01:03:35.313 --> 01:03:36.502
Since when did you start...

01:03:36.592 --> 01:03:38.395
caring about Mr. Chambers, Phil?

01:03:38.472 --> 01:03:40.314
Well, it's not that.

01:03:40.433 --> 01:03:43.041
It's just, people are
starting to ask questions.

01:03:43.193 --> 01:03:44.612
Questions.

01:03:44.714 --> 01:03:46.441
What do you want, Phil?

01:03:47.873 --> 01:03:49.561
Well, given the, uh...

01:03:49.673 --> 01:03:53.471
unexpected hassles,
the delays...

01:03:53.673 --> 01:03:54.977
I'd like another 250.

01:03:55.074 --> 01:03:57.720
Ah, ok. 250 it is.

01:03:57.874 --> 01:03:59.216
Oh! That's great.

01:04:00.273 --> 01:04:03.534
240. 250,000.

01:04:03.713 --> 01:04:04.749
Thank you.

01:04:08.713 --> 01:04:10.401
I guess this is good-bye, then.

01:04:11.513 --> 01:04:13.125
Have a nice trip, Mr. Gold.

01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:14.344
Thank you.

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.609
Oh!

01:05:39.034 --> 01:05:40.070
Now what?

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.123
What the hell
you looking at?

01:07:22.233 --> 01:07:24.727
It has been brought
to my attention...

01:07:24.873 --> 01:07:27.712
that a few of you
have been interfering...

01:07:27.873 --> 01:07:30.443
with the punishment
of inmate Chambers.

01:07:30.594 --> 01:07:32.512
All those responsible...

01:07:32.634 --> 01:07:35.933
identify themselves now
by raising their hands.

01:07:49.434 --> 01:07:50.470
Step forward!

01:07:55.435 --> 01:07:56.931
Anyone else?

01:08:02.634 --> 01:08:03.669
Ah-ha.

01:08:06.474 --> 01:08:07.472
I see.

01:08:25.712 --> 01:08:27.055
Very cute.

01:08:27.113 --> 01:08:29.032
So now you'll stand out here...

01:08:29.154 --> 01:08:31.571
in the fucking cold
and think about it!

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:52.596
Shut up. I told you
to do nothing...

01:08:52.714 --> 01:08:54.095
nothing without asking me first.

01:08:55.394 --> 01:08:56.545
Shut the fuck up!

01:08:56.634 --> 01:08:57.747
If anything happens to him...

01:08:57.834 --> 01:08:59.675
I will strip you naked...

01:08:59.795 --> 01:09:01.674
and hang you by the balls
from the watchtower.

01:09:01.795 --> 01:09:02.944
- Heh.
- Open the door.

01:09:02.993 --> 01:09:04.720
- Gaga--
- Now, Vlad!

01:09:09.993 --> 01:09:11.299
It was never meant
you'd be put out...

01:09:11.394 --> 01:09:13.696
in the cold like that,
Mr. Chambers. I apologize.

01:09:14.434 --> 01:09:17.502
We had a deal.
I fight, I go free.

01:09:17.673 --> 01:09:20.205
No, the deal was...

01:09:20.393 --> 01:09:22.656
you win, you go free.

01:09:24.154 --> 01:09:25.917
I was drugged and you know it.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.642
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:33.250
Maybe next time you fight Boyka...

01:09:33.354 --> 01:09:36.270
you should pick
a better cornerman.

01:09:36.435 --> 01:09:37.662
Fuck you!

01:09:38.835 --> 01:09:40.944
There ain't gonna be
a next time.

01:09:41.033 --> 01:09:44.026
Listen to me, George.
It's very simple.

01:09:47.715 --> 01:09:51.973
I make my money.
You make your exit.

01:09:54.395 --> 01:09:55.891
Fuck you!

01:09:57.714 --> 01:09:58.980
Fuck me?

01:10:00.835 --> 01:10:02.100
As you wish.

01:10:04.874 --> 01:10:06.754
Enjoy the rest
of your stay here...

01:10:06.874 --> 01:10:07.833
Mr. Chambers.

01:10:13.754 --> 01:10:14.713
Hold on.

01:10:18.794 --> 01:10:20.750
No drugs.

01:10:20.874 --> 01:10:24.096
Not me, not Boyka.

01:10:24.315 --> 01:10:26.424
We fight straight up.

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:28.550
Of course.

01:10:28.715 --> 01:10:29.904
Look, George...

01:10:29.995 --> 01:10:32.680
keeping you here any longer
is a bit of a hassle for me.

01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:35.289
You're, uh, too visible.

01:10:35.435 --> 01:10:38.273
All I want is one more fight.

01:10:38.394 --> 01:10:39.852
One.

01:10:40.915 --> 01:10:42.142
And Phil?

01:10:42.235 --> 01:10:43.769
Heh.

01:10:43.876 --> 01:10:45.372
You don't have
to worry about Phil.

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:48.619
Where he is, money...heh...

01:10:48.795 --> 01:10:51.020
Money is not a factor.

01:10:54.475 --> 01:10:57.544
Anything else I can do
for you, Mr. Chambers?

01:11:02.514 --> 01:11:03.703
Yeah.

01:11:04.874 --> 01:11:07.406
I'm gonna need one
more thing from you.

01:12:16.155 --> 01:12:17.114
George?

01:12:20.835 --> 01:12:23.175
You know where
this coat come from?

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:27.814
'Cause I hear it come from...

01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:32.291
selfish asshole who never
does anything for anyone else.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.932
Why?

01:12:35.035 --> 01:12:36.953
Why you think?

01:12:37.075 --> 01:12:38.648
It's cold as a motherfucker
around here.

01:12:40.195 --> 01:12:42.803
You know, George,
I saw first fight.

01:12:42.955 --> 01:12:45.487
I saw something
in first round.

01:12:45.635 --> 01:12:47.860
Something
in your eyes.

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:50.604
Before you started
to look drunk.

01:12:50.716 --> 01:12:52.864
Ok, Crot,
what did you see?

01:12:53.955 --> 01:12:55.643
What did you see, George?

01:12:58.195 --> 01:13:00.075
Tsk.

01:13:00.236 --> 01:13:01.693
OK.

01:13:01.796 --> 01:13:04.481
Maybe I underestimated
the guy a little bit.

01:13:04.634 --> 01:13:06.322
But I know how he fights now.

01:13:06.394 --> 01:13:08.964
And that same stuff ain't
gonna work on me a second time.

01:13:09.074 --> 01:13:10.340
I'm gonna figure somethin' out.

01:13:10.435 --> 01:13:13.351
Maybe...you need a little help.

01:13:14.677 --> 01:13:15.597
Oh, you gonna help me?

01:13:17.755 --> 01:13:20.325
I'm no fighter, George.

01:13:20.476 --> 01:13:23.199
But I was once trained
how to hurt people.

01:13:23.356 --> 01:13:25.580
I know a thing or two
about grappling...

01:13:25.716 --> 01:13:27.327
military close combat.

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:30.198
Things you might need
in this type of fight.

01:13:31.716 --> 01:13:34.593
You know what, Crot?
Thanks, but I'm OK.

01:13:35.076 --> 01:13:36.150
Hey, this is all
street fighting anyway,

01:13:36.234 --> 01:13:37.577
and that's what I'm from.

01:13:37.675 --> 01:13:39.440
I'll just go home on his ass.

01:13:39.556 --> 01:13:43.277
Besides, all that kickboxing
and grappling stuff...

01:13:43.515 --> 01:13:45.011
- it's overrated.
- Aah!

01:13:45.195 --> 01:13:47.842
# I move weight like a freight
truck, build the muscle #

01:13:47.995 --> 01:13:49.491
# You can't escape your fate,
we ain't scared to tussle #

01:13:49.596 --> 01:13:51.283
Aaah!

01:13:51.396 --> 01:13:52.431
# I put the pressure
on your offense #

01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:54.126
# You can't advance,
I'm a pro #

01:13:54.234 --> 01:13:56.459
# Hit the bench, bro,
you had your chance #

01:13:56.595 --> 01:13:59.204
# Do my dance in the end zone,
and hone my skill #

01:13:59.354 --> 01:14:01.963
# If I don't take it
all the way, no one will #

01:14:02.115 --> 01:14:04.187
# Get back, you outta line,
you outta your mind #

01:14:04.316 --> 01:14:06.349
# You outta time,
keep searching, brotha #

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:08.125
# How do you find
another man #

01:14:08.234 --> 01:14:10.152
# As efficient
as this machine I am? #

01:14:10.276 --> 01:14:12.155
Beat me at my own game, huh?

01:14:13.476 --> 01:14:16.353
I'm gonna beat you at yours.

01:14:16.556 --> 01:14:18.205
Hmm.

01:14:18.396 --> 01:14:19.853
Now listen, George.

01:14:19.995 --> 01:14:21.990
Man is like pyramid...

01:14:22.116 --> 01:14:24.533
but upside down.

01:14:24.715 --> 01:14:28.666
You cut his legs--
Finish.

01:14:28.876 --> 01:14:32.366
OK.
How do we...begin?

01:14:35.915 --> 01:14:37.488
Now get on top of me.

01:14:37.595 --> 01:14:39.590
Sorry, man, I'm just
not attracted to you.

01:14:39.715 --> 01:14:42.017
Maybe it's the beard.

01:14:43.316 --> 01:14:45.886
You want to train
or you want to joke?

01:14:46.035 --> 01:14:47.032
# Bring it on #

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:48.612
# And I'm ready to eat #

01:14:48.756 --> 01:14:50.213
# So if you're scared,
get outta here #

01:14:50.355 --> 01:14:51.774
# Before you get beat #

01:14:51.876 --> 01:14:52.796
# Bring it on #

01:14:52.916 --> 01:14:54.412
# Yeah, the heat is on #

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:55.937
# You better get
your best to the plate #

01:14:55.996 --> 01:14:56.955
# Or it be the gong #

01:14:57.075 --> 01:14:58.495
# Calculate the magnitude #

01:14:58.595 --> 01:15:00.321
# Of the situation
you're facing #

01:15:00.435 --> 01:15:02.314
# No time for pacing,
there's no time for wastin' #

01:15:02.436 --> 01:15:03.356
Unh!

01:15:03.436 --> 01:15:05.008
So this is a basic arm lock.

01:15:06.315 --> 01:15:08.694
When you punch, I grab.

01:15:08.836 --> 01:15:11.560
I wrap arm.

01:15:11.676 --> 01:15:14.054
Put pressure, you see?

01:15:17.195 --> 01:15:20.187
You know the old man
is training the American?

01:15:20.357 --> 01:15:23.195
Is that supposed to scare me?

01:15:23.355 --> 01:15:25.963
He can learn any fucking
thing he wants.

01:15:26.156 --> 01:15:27.307
Yaah!

01:15:28.876 --> 01:15:31.101
He's still not going
to leave that ring alive.

01:15:36.075 --> 01:15:37.034
# Bring it on #

01:15:37.115 --> 01:15:38.496
# Do you accept the challenge? #

01:15:38.554 --> 01:15:39.859
# Bring it on #

01:15:39.956 --> 01:15:41.375
# I'm-a test your balance #

01:15:41.476 --> 01:15:42.473
- Argh!
- # Bring it on #

01:15:42.555 --> 01:15:43.783
# You can't stand the violence #

01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:45.218
# Bring it on #

01:15:45.316 --> 01:15:46.774
# Put your tail between
your legs, leave in silence #

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.526
- # Bring it on #
- Argh!

01:15:48.635 --> 01:15:49.556
# You can't handle the heat #

01:15:49.636 --> 01:15:50.672
# Bring it on #

01:16:15.876 --> 01:16:17.334
Hey, man, sorry. Uh--

01:16:17.436 --> 01:16:19.085
No, it's OK.

01:16:27.835 --> 01:16:29.485
Potato vodka.

01:16:40.075 --> 01:16:42.070
I make it in my toilet.

01:16:43.436 --> 01:16:45.047
No, man, I'm gonna pass.

01:16:47.075 --> 01:16:48.955
Of course, you are in training.

01:16:51.595 --> 01:16:53.628
So what's up
with the photograph?

01:17:04.275 --> 01:17:06.116
She's beautiful, isn't she?

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:08.476
Who is she?

01:17:09.557 --> 01:17:10.938
My niece.

01:17:11.036 --> 01:17:12.800
She's almost nineteen, now.

01:17:12.916 --> 01:17:14.604
She ever visit you here?

01:17:14.716 --> 01:17:16.174
No.

01:17:17.236 --> 01:17:18.808
Never.

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:19.875
Why not?

01:17:22.756 --> 01:17:24.214
She doesn't know that I'm here...

01:17:24.316 --> 01:17:25.774
that I exist.

01:17:25.876 --> 01:17:28.753
I never want her
to come to this place.

01:17:32.156 --> 01:17:34.803
Hey, I was just wondering...

01:17:34.955 --> 01:17:36.221
what happened?

01:17:36.316 --> 01:17:37.966
How did you get yourself
in this place?

01:17:40.996 --> 01:17:43.260
When I was in the army...

01:17:43.436 --> 01:17:45.469
my younger brother...

01:17:45.596 --> 01:17:49.508
he robbed party headquarters
near our house.

01:17:49.716 --> 01:17:52.861
It happened when
I was home on leave.

01:17:54.674 --> 01:17:57.513
He come home one day...

01:17:57.676 --> 01:18:00.055
and I see it in his eyes.

01:18:00.197 --> 01:18:03.649
He tells me he just
made a big mistake.

01:18:04.797 --> 01:18:06.907
- Your brother?
- Yes.

01:18:07.036 --> 01:18:09.530
Well, why the hell isn't
he here instead of you?

01:18:09.676 --> 01:18:11.824
Victor was brilliant.

01:18:11.996 --> 01:18:13.952
He had a future...

01:18:14.117 --> 01:18:16.073
And a wife.

01:18:16.197 --> 01:18:17.770
A pregnant wife.

01:18:19.556 --> 01:18:20.477
Me?

01:18:22.356 --> 01:18:24.965
I was only a trained
killer for Brezhnev.

01:18:26.957 --> 01:18:28.414
So...

01:18:28.517 --> 01:18:30.818
you basically traded
your life for his.

01:18:30.957 --> 01:18:31.954
No, no.

01:18:32.037 --> 01:18:34.339
I-I was given only four
years for the robbery.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.970
But when I got here they
tried to drive me crazy.

01:18:37.156 --> 01:18:39.343
So finally, I decided to escape.

01:18:39.476 --> 01:18:40.972
I tried twice, actually.

01:18:41.077 --> 01:18:42.611
The second time
there was a fight.

01:18:42.756 --> 01:18:44.175
A guard got killed.

01:18:45.715 --> 01:18:47.595
I was also shot, paralyzed.

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:50.402
They put me here in solitary.

01:18:50.556 --> 01:18:52.435
Soviet style.

01:18:52.556 --> 01:18:54.857
You see, George?

01:18:54.998 --> 01:18:57.338
I accepted my reality.

01:18:59.437 --> 01:19:02.122
This is where I belong.

01:19:02.276 --> 01:19:05.115
And this is where I will die.

01:19:07.277 --> 01:19:09.195
I don't get it, Crot.

01:19:10.717 --> 01:19:11.868
It's Nikolai.

01:19:11.916 --> 01:19:13.374
Huh?

01:19:13.436 --> 01:19:17.693
My name, it's Nikolai.

01:19:17.917 --> 01:19:19.796
And I know you don't get it.

01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:25.426
# Oh, yeah #

01:19:27.477 --> 01:19:28.397
Argh!

01:19:28.477 --> 01:19:30.625
# It's an illusion #

01:19:31.717 --> 01:19:33.136
Ugh!

01:19:42.157 --> 01:19:43.576
Ow!

01:19:43.636 --> 01:19:44.902
Ugh!

01:19:47.796 --> 01:19:49.024
- Ow!
- Argh!

01:19:50.676 --> 01:19:52.019
Argh!

01:19:54.158 --> 01:19:56.459
Now on top of shoulder.

01:19:57.677 --> 01:19:59.135
Lock with head.

01:20:00.237 --> 01:20:02.347
Now press on top of knee.

01:20:04.756 --> 01:20:05.753
Press, George.

01:20:05.837 --> 01:20:07.333
Harder!

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:09.086
If I press any harder
it's gonna break.

01:20:09.197 --> 01:20:11.153
Good, maybe I start
to feel the leg again.

01:20:18.396 --> 01:20:19.892
Boyka.

01:20:22.957 --> 01:20:24.299
Boyka.

01:20:24.397 --> 01:20:25.279
Chambers.

01:20:26.356 --> 01:20:28.006
Chambers.

01:20:31.877 --> 01:20:33.565
Boyka.

01:20:33.677 --> 01:20:34.828
Chambers.

01:20:35.877 --> 01:20:36.836
Chambers.

01:20:47.156 --> 01:20:48.806
You are trippin'.

01:20:51.916 --> 01:20:54.563
Tonight, I settle it forever.

01:20:55.677 --> 01:20:58.132
I beat this man again...

01:20:58.318 --> 01:21:00.734
then there is no question.

01:21:03.397 --> 01:21:06.313
I'm the most complete
fighter in the world.

01:21:06.476 --> 01:21:08.586
Remember, George...

01:21:08.717 --> 01:21:10.328
when fight is over...

01:21:10.477 --> 01:21:12.472
you need to leave fast.
Don't look back.

01:21:14.277 --> 01:21:16.233
Listen...

01:21:16.358 --> 01:21:17.739
Nikolai, I, uh...

01:21:19.557 --> 01:21:22.280
- I'm glad that--
- No, shut up.

01:21:22.397 --> 01:21:24.162
Stay mean for fight.

01:21:29.555 --> 01:21:30.821
Yeah, you're right.

01:21:33.996 --> 01:21:35.147
I'll see you later.

01:21:35.237 --> 01:21:36.426
George...

01:21:42.876 --> 01:21:44.257
I'm glad, too.

01:21:50.117 --> 01:21:53.378
Once again, please welcome...

01:21:53.557 --> 01:21:58.429
former Heavyweight Boxing
Champion of the World...

01:21:58.676 --> 01:21:59.635
George...

01:21:59.717 --> 01:22:02.210
Iceman Chambeeers!

01:22:04.838 --> 01:22:06.410
Chambers! Chambers!

01:22:06.557 --> 01:22:08.552
And now, let's welcome...

01:22:08.717 --> 01:22:13.435
our own undefeated
Heavyweight Champion...

01:22:13.718 --> 01:22:16.326
Uri Boykaaaaa!

01:22:17.477 --> 01:22:19.280
Boyka! Boyka!

01:22:19.398 --> 01:22:20.318
Boyka! Boyka!

01:22:20.397 --> 01:22:23.159
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

01:22:23.277 --> 01:22:25.271
- Boyka! Boyka!
- Chambers!

01:22:37.197 --> 01:22:40.304
Boyka! Boyka!

01:22:43.478 --> 01:22:44.936
Fight!

01:22:45.079 --> 01:22:45.999
Unh!

01:22:47.078 --> 01:22:47.998
- Unh! Ah!
- Uh!

01:22:54.998 --> 01:22:56.225
Unh! Unh! Unh!

01:23:00.637 --> 01:23:02.709
Argh! Unh!

01:23:04.998 --> 01:23:06.072
Ugh!

01:23:06.157 --> 01:23:07.308
Argh!

01:23:07.397 --> 01:23:08.356
Yeah!

01:23:08.438 --> 01:23:09.397
Unh!

01:23:10.837 --> 01:23:12.640
- Argh!
- Unh!

01:23:12.757 --> 01:23:15.097
Argh!

01:23:16.998 --> 01:23:18.455
- Unh! Ah!
- Uh!

01:23:19.558 --> 01:23:20.862
Argh!

01:23:20.957 --> 01:23:22.645
Ugh!

01:23:23.837 --> 01:23:24.758
Move in!

01:23:24.837 --> 01:23:27.100
Boyka! Boyka!

01:23:27.237 --> 01:23:28.349
- Argh!
- Yah!

01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:29.395
Ugh!

01:23:31.558 --> 01:23:33.360
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

01:23:36.117 --> 01:23:37.574
Argh!

01:23:37.676 --> 01:23:38.596
Ow!

01:23:44.598 --> 01:23:46.976
Stop! Round's over!

01:23:51.877 --> 01:23:53.335
Not bad for first round, George.

01:23:53.437 --> 01:23:55.202
But why you don't
use your new technique?

01:23:55.318 --> 01:23:56.584
I'm working on it.

01:23:57.638 --> 01:23:59.901
Boyka, make him wait.

01:24:00.038 --> 01:24:02.915
Remember, take his leg.

01:24:06.598 --> 01:24:08.055
Fight!

01:24:11.518 --> 01:24:12.669
Unh!

01:24:15.557 --> 01:24:16.555
Argh!

01:24:18.718 --> 01:24:20.482
Unh! Uh!

01:24:23.077 --> 01:24:24.534
Unh! Ugh!

01:24:26.157 --> 01:24:27.347
Arrrgh!

01:24:31.437 --> 01:24:32.358
Ugh! Unh!

01:24:32.437 --> 01:24:34.508
- Argh!
- Ow!

01:24:34.638 --> 01:24:36.134
Ugh!

01:24:37.758 --> 01:24:40.136
Boyka! Boyka! Boyka!

01:24:40.277 --> 01:24:41.965
Boyka! Boyka!

01:24:42.078 --> 01:24:43.343
Unh!

01:24:44.918 --> 01:24:45.954
Ow!

01:24:47.438 --> 01:24:48.972
Arrrgh!

01:24:52.957 --> 01:24:53.878
Argh!

01:24:55.597 --> 01:24:57.323
Argh!

01:24:57.438 --> 01:24:58.665
Argh!

01:24:58.758 --> 01:24:59.678
Take him!

01:25:05.917 --> 01:25:07.221
Argh!

01:25:17.956 --> 01:25:19.644
Listen to me, George.

01:25:19.756 --> 01:25:20.869
You must finish him...

01:25:20.957 --> 01:25:22.645
or you will rot in
this stinking hole...

01:25:22.798 --> 01:25:24.179
for the rest of your life.

01:25:24.317 --> 01:25:26.351
Like me!

01:25:27.678 --> 01:25:29.519
- Go!
- Ugh!

01:25:31.397 --> 01:25:33.238
I am the champion.

01:25:34.799 --> 01:25:37.139
They will never let you
out of here.

01:25:37.279 --> 01:25:40.386
Do you understand me, George?

01:25:40.558 --> 01:25:41.671
What are you waiting for?

01:25:41.758 --> 01:25:43.062
The bell.

01:25:45.078 --> 01:25:46.344
Argh!

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:50.837
Ow!

01:25:51.959 --> 01:25:52.918
Yaaah!

01:25:54.238 --> 01:25:56.387
# You can't advance,
I'm the storm at night #

01:25:56.598 --> 01:25:59.321
# Bring it on
and be ready to fight #

01:25:59.518 --> 01:26:00.899
# Do you accept
the challenge? #

01:26:00.997 --> 01:26:02.110
# Bring it on #

01:26:02.238 --> 01:26:03.466
# I'm-a test your balance #

01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:04.556
# Bring it on #

01:26:04.678 --> 01:26:05.599
# You can't stand
the violence #

01:26:05.678 --> 01:26:07.098
- Ow!
- # Bring it on #

01:26:07.238 --> 01:26:09.041
# So put your tail between your
legs and run off in silence #

01:26:09.157 --> 01:26:10.269
# Bring it on #

01:26:10.357 --> 01:26:11.623
# You can't handle the heat #

01:26:11.678 --> 01:26:12.752
# Bring it on #

01:26:12.838 --> 01:26:14.641
# This cannibal
is hungry for meat #

01:26:14.758 --> 01:26:15.986
# Bring it on #

01:26:16.078 --> 01:26:17.881
# And I'm ready to eat,
so if you're scared #

01:26:17.998 --> 01:26:19.763
# Get outta here
before you get beat #

01:26:19.838 --> 01:26:22.063
# Bring it on #

01:26:24.517 --> 01:26:26.166
Chambers! Chambers!

01:26:26.277 --> 01:26:28.233
# Is to shine more bright
in the sunlight #

01:26:28.357 --> 01:26:29.508
# I'm the storm at night #

01:26:29.598 --> 01:26:32.053
# Bring it on
and be ready to fight #

01:26:32.199 --> 01:26:33.695
# Do you accept the challenge? #

01:26:33.839 --> 01:26:36.294
Unh!

01:26:36.478 --> 01:26:38.051
Argh!
Argh!

01:26:38.718 --> 01:26:39.984
Now on top of shoulder.

01:26:40.078 --> 01:26:40.998
Argh!

01:26:41.079 --> 01:26:41.999
Lock with head.

01:26:42.079 --> 01:26:42.999
Argh!

01:26:43.079 --> 01:26:44.920
Argh!

01:26:45.039 --> 01:26:46.075
Press harder!

01:26:47.398 --> 01:26:48.434
Fuck you!

01:26:49.798 --> 01:26:50.795
Argh!

01:26:52.318 --> 01:26:53.430
Press, George.

01:26:54.879 --> 01:26:55.838
Harder.

01:26:57.158 --> 01:26:58.347
Ugh!

01:26:58.438 --> 01:26:59.550
If I press any harder
it's gonna break.

01:27:01.477 --> 01:27:02.666
I'll kill you,
motherfucker!

01:27:03.998 --> 01:27:05.340
Aaaah!

01:27:05.398 --> 01:27:06.894
- Yes!
- Aaah!

01:27:07.038 --> 01:27:09.531
Aaah!

01:27:09.718 --> 01:27:10.946
Aaaargh!

01:27:11.037 --> 01:27:12.034
Argh!

01:27:12.157 --> 01:27:13.615
Aah!

01:27:19.757 --> 01:27:21.138
Don't touch me!

01:27:25.197 --> 01:27:31.105
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

01:27:31.398 --> 01:27:33.968
Chambers! Chambers!

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:39.135
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

01:27:39.318 --> 01:27:41.620
Chambers! Chambers!

01:27:41.758 --> 01:27:43.446
Chambers! Chambers! Chambers!

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:46.627
Chambers! Chambers!
Chambers! Chambers!

01:27:49.198 --> 01:27:50.733
Chambers! Chambers!

01:27:50.878 --> 01:27:52.950
You made a fortune.

01:27:53.078 --> 01:27:57.259
Yeah. I had a feeling
our luck would change.

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:58.512
Hmm?

01:28:04.198 --> 01:28:05.771
Chambers! Chambers!

01:28:23.078 --> 01:28:25.379
Congratulations, Mr. Chambers.

01:28:27.598 --> 01:28:29.095
I'm outta here, right?

01:28:31.558 --> 01:28:33.092
Yes, you are.

01:28:36.119 --> 01:28:37.270
One moment.

01:28:40.717 --> 01:28:41.676
What's this?

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:44.354
Your cut.

01:28:46.999 --> 01:28:48.763
Listen, George,
it was never my intention...

01:28:48.879 --> 01:28:50.758
to make your stay here
so unpleasant.

01:28:50.879 --> 01:28:53.679
I'm sorry for that.
One more moment.

01:28:53.838 --> 01:28:56.524
Do you mind if we take
a photo together, me and you?

01:28:56.679 --> 01:28:59.326
Not for me. My nephew.

01:28:59.478 --> 01:29:01.243
Big fan of yours.

01:29:01.358 --> 01:29:03.583
Let me tell you something.

01:29:03.678 --> 01:29:06.286
I'm not gonna forget
what you did to me.

01:29:06.438 --> 01:29:08.010
Ever.

01:29:08.118 --> 01:29:09.882
And I will see you again.

01:29:09.998 --> 01:29:12.069
That's my word.

01:29:12.199 --> 01:29:13.886
But right now...

01:29:13.998 --> 01:29:15.877
I'd like to get
the hell out of here.

01:29:15.999 --> 01:29:17.418
Sure.

01:29:28.559 --> 01:29:29.786
One moment.

01:29:33.878 --> 01:29:35.643
Where the fuck is he going now?

01:29:40.479 --> 01:29:42.627
I wouldn't try anything
stupid, Mr. Chambers.

01:29:42.719 --> 01:29:43.985
There are guards outside.

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:46.955
Relax, I just need to talk
to you about something.

01:29:47.079 --> 01:29:48.614
What?

01:29:53.959 --> 01:29:55.417
I wanna make a deal.

01:30:04.518 --> 01:30:06.359
Came to say good-bye, huh?

01:30:08.877 --> 01:30:09.836
Yeah.

01:30:12.599 --> 01:30:14.095
You did well.

01:30:15.718 --> 01:30:18.595
I did all right.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.640
Do you still have
that jacket I got you?

01:30:20.759 --> 01:30:22.217
Of course.

01:30:25.439 --> 01:30:27.702
I will hold on to it forever.

01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:29.795
Well, now that's up to you...

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.146
but you better grab it
and put it on right now.

01:30:33.239 --> 01:30:34.160
Why?

01:30:35.399 --> 01:30:37.432
Because, Nikolai...

01:30:37.559 --> 01:30:40.551
there's an 18-year-old girl
who needs to meet her uncle.

01:30:40.718 --> 01:30:42.828
And it's cold as
a motherfucker out there.

01:31:02.398 --> 01:31:04.777
I don't know about this, George.

01:31:07.239 --> 01:31:08.850
It's all right, Nikolai.

01:31:08.958 --> 01:31:11.222
You got a lot of time
to let it sink in now.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.068
I'm telling you, George,
it's a mistake.

01:31:24.239 --> 01:31:25.735
No, it ain't.

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.224
No, I can't.

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.698
Ah! Yes, you can.

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:23.952
No, I can't.

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:26.341
- Go.
- Oh, George.

01:34:00.799 --> 01:34:02.256
# Oh #

01:34:02.318 --> 01:34:05.080
# I move weight like a freight
truck, build the muscle #

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.656
# You can't escape your fate,
we ain't scared to tussle #

01:34:07.841 --> 01:34:10.373
# I put the pressure on your
offense, you can't advance #

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.244
# I'm a pro, hit the bench, bro,
you had your chance #

01:34:13.399 --> 01:34:16.122
# Do that dance in the end zone
and hone my skill #

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.852
# If I don't take it
all the way, no one will #

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.494
# Get back, you outta line,
you outta your mind #

01:34:21.679 --> 01:34:23.444
# You outta time,
keep searching, brotha #

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.440
# How do you find
another man #

01:34:25.519 --> 01:34:27.399
# As efficient
as this machine I am? #

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:30.474
# I was born immortal,
to be the king of the sport, a portal #

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:32.750
# Just follow me
to the next dimension #

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.450
# You get lifted like
these plates I'm benchin' #

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.134
# Go ahead,
put your two cents in #

01:34:37.239 --> 01:34:38.620
# Your worries
are worthless #

01:34:38.679 --> 01:34:41.288
# Takes a strong-like mind
to understand my purpose #

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:43.511
# It's to shine
more bright than sunlight #

01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.982
# I'm the storm at night #

01:34:45.039 --> 01:34:46.881
# Bring it on,
if you ready to fight #

01:34:46.999 --> 01:34:47.958
# Bring it on #

01:34:48.039 --> 01:34:49.113
# Do you accept the challenge? #

01:34:49.239 --> 01:34:50.352
# Bring it on #

01:34:50.479 --> 01:34:52.014
# I'm-a test your balance #

01:34:52.159 --> 01:34:53.080
# Bring it on #

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.696
# You can't stand the violence #

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:57.601
# So put your tail between
your legs and leave in silence #

01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:58.680
# Bring it on #

01:34:58.759 --> 01:35:00.140
# You can't handle the heat #

01:35:00.279 --> 01:35:01.699
# Bring it on #

01:35:01.799 --> 01:35:03.065
# This cannibal
is hungry for meat #

01:35:03.159 --> 01:35:04.425
# Bring it on #

01:35:04.521 --> 01:35:06.362
# And I'm ready to eat,
so if you're scared #

01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.437
# Get outta here
before you get beat #

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.672
# Bring it on #

01:35:09.761 --> 01:35:11.257
# Yeah, the heat is on #

01:35:11.361 --> 01:35:14.238
# You better get your best
to the plate or it be the gong #

01:35:14.399 --> 01:35:16.931
# Calculate the magnitude of
the situation you're facing #

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:19.460
# No time for pacin',
there's no time for wastin' #

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.518
# What, you thought
it would be a cake walk? #

01:35:21.641 --> 01:35:23.789
# I won't make it easy
for you to hate-talk #

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.109
# The trash is big #

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.158
# No, I couldn't let
you do it no longer #

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.158
# So I built up mass
and my passion is stronger #

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:33.122
# To the point that
I need an extra me to hold it #

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.354
# So think
that you could try #

01:35:34.441 --> 01:35:36.128
# But ain't no need
to fold it #

01:35:36.241 --> 01:35:38.773
# Or bend it any which way,
nothing is happening #

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:41.567
# Just me groovin' here,
I'm-a keep on rappin' #

01:35:41.719 --> 01:35:44.481
# And then the competition has
to retire, no other chance #

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.172
# Who can do it like I do it?
No other voice #

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.967
# If you need some help, call
the doctor, get some medicine #

01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:51.538
# I'll expire you,
bring you back to life #

01:35:51.639 --> 01:35:52.828
# And make you dead again #

01:35:52.919 --> 01:35:53.839
# Bring it on #

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.454
# Do you accept the challenge?#

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:56.672
# Bring it on #

01:35:56.759 --> 01:35:58.217
# I'm-a test your balance #

01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.357
# Bring it on #

01:35:59.441 --> 01:36:00.592
# You can't stand the violence #

01:36:00.721 --> 01:36:02.140
# Bring it on #

01:36:02.281 --> 01:36:03.777
# So put your tail between your
legs and leave in silence #

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:04.840
# Bring it on #

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.454
# You can't handle the heat #

01:36:06.559 --> 01:36:07.633
# Bring it on #

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.178
# This cannibal
is hungry for meat #

01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.546
# Bring it on #

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.788
# And I'm ready to eat,
so if you're scared #

01:36:12.921 --> 01:36:14.493
# Get outta here,
before you get beat #

01:36:14.601 --> 01:36:15.752
# Bring it on #

01:36:15.839 --> 01:36:17.220
# Show me the money,
show me the glory #

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.816
# Gimme a second
to demonstrate #

01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:20.340
# Let me tell you the story #

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.588
# Do me a favor, pretend my name
wasn't in the street #

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.947
# If you my homie #

01:36:24.041 --> 01:36:25.728
# You won't have no problem
holding this heat #

01:36:25.841 --> 01:36:27.222
# If you my enemy,
then stay away #

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:28.663
# You gets no love #

01:36:28.759 --> 01:36:31.061
# lmagine your soul escaping,
just floatin' above #

01:36:31.239 --> 01:36:33.963
# Another day, another dollar,
earned the paper real slick #

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:36.767
# Ah, it doesn't matter
if it's illegitimate #

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.644
# Either way we're gonna get
what we want and get it quick #

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.217
# If you in the way, you feel
the contents of this clip #

01:36:42.359 --> 01:36:45.006
# I'm not a gangsta, but I know
gangstas belong in the dump #

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.579
# I'm not a softie,
come on, let me see you #

01:36:46.679 --> 01:36:48.022
# Show you a chump #

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.460
# Not a little boy talkin'
big man talk, neither #

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:53.477
# I'm a cold brotha, never
catch me without a heater #

01:36:53.639 --> 01:36:56.017
# You want drama, I've got it
for you like it was Broadway #

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.846
# Didn't wanna miss a night, you
have to learn it the hard way #

01:36:59.001 --> 01:36:59.960
# Bring it on #

01:37:00.041 --> 01:37:01.768
