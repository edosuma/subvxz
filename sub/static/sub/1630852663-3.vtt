- Aurora Fane is organizing
another charity?

01:46.397 --> 01:48.316
She must be a glutton
for punishment

01:48.399 --> 01:49.818
after the last time.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.487
- You say that, but the bazaar
made over $2,000,

01:52.570 --> 01:54.155
which no one's ever heard of.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.950
- She and Anne Morris
were a laughingstock.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.202
- This is interesting.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.329

called Clara Barton?

02:02.455 --> 02:04.332

- Excuse me.

02:04.415 --> 02:05.500
- What is it, Miss Scott?

02:05.583 --> 02:06.709
- Just a letter
for you to sign.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.878
But I'd like to get it
into the post before luncheon.

02:08.962 --> 02:09.921
- Quite right.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.923
- Miss Barton has started
a branch of the Red Cross

02:12.006 --> 02:13.049
in the United States.

02:13.132 --> 02:15.385
She's giving a talk

May I come with you?
- Of course.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.224

02:21.307 --> 02:23.726
- Oh, look.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.353
Miss Russell is going out.

02:25.436 --> 02:26.855
- With her wretched governess.

02:26.938 --> 02:27.897
How can she stand it?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.691
- I will not criticize
Mrs. Russell

02:29.774 --> 02:31.192
for her only virtue.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.570
At least she keeps
her daughter under control.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.114
- Under arrest, more like.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.282
- I wonder why her mother

02:37.365 --> 02:39.242
hasn't brought her out
properly yet.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.871
- Because Mrs. Russell is not
sure she can fill the ballroom.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.206
You see?

02:45.290 --> 02:48.084
I know more about these things
than you give me credit for.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.005
- You know I'd lose my job
if your mother even suspects.

- I know you'll lose your job
if she finds out

02:53.798 --> 02:55.675
you've been taking brandy
from the dining room.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.094
- It was purely medicinal.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.679
Who is this young man anyway?

02:59.762 --> 03:01.389
- Archie Baldwin.
- Hyah!

03:01.472 --> 03:02.974
- He's very respectable.

03:03.057 --> 03:04.601
His grandfather
was an ambassador.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.603
His father is a banker,
and so is he.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.438
His mother's people came over
on the "Mayflower."

03:08.521 --> 03:09.898
- Hmm,
if everyone who claimed

03:09.981 --> 03:11.232
to be on the "Mayflower"
really was,

03:11.316 --> 03:13.735
it would have to be the size
of a White Star liner.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.069
Where does he live?

03:15.153 --> 03:16.237
- 35th Street.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.781
And his parents are building
a summer home at Newport.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.742
- Well, why not just
introduce him to your mother?

03:20.825 --> 03:23.286
He sounds ideal.
- It's not as simple as that.

a magic lantern show

03:31.586 --> 03:33.922

It starts this Friday.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.215
- Fancy.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.426
- Would you like to see it
on your night off?

03:38.509 --> 03:39.677
- What, all alone?

03:39.761 --> 03:41.179
- That could be
my free night too.

03:41.262 --> 03:44.182
Mr. Bannister wouldn't mind,
not if we aren't entertaining.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.808
- I'll have to think.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.061
- Don't think too long.
It's only running a week.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.438
- Go on. You might enjoy it.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.273
- Mr. Bannister,
you wouldn't mind, would you,

03:52.357 --> 03:54.442
if Bridget and I had
the same free night this week?

03:54.525 --> 03:55.985
- I would have
to serve dinner alone.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.071
- But you do that when I have
a free evening anyway.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.406
- Today's young
live for pleasure.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.950
You don't know
what hard work is.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.701
- And we don't know
what fun is.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.370
- What--what about Friday?

04:05.453 --> 04:07.288
I'd be very grateful.
So would Bridget.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.290
- I haven't said I'll go yet.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.125
- But you know you want to.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.758
- I thought
you'd gone hours ago.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.093
- I wanted to finish
some letters.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.679
- Is everything set
with the new station?

04:22.762 --> 04:23.638
- The bill's been passed.

04:23.721 --> 04:24.973
- And the stocks are high?

04:25.056 --> 04:26.349
- As high as the sky.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.558
- Then what's this about?

04:29.102 --> 04:30.645
What do they mean,
there's a rumor that the law

04:30.728 --> 04:32.689
may be rescinded?
- Let me see that.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.441
- If it's canceled, will
the station go ahead anyway?

04:37.527 --> 04:38.778
- No, it can't.

04:40.863 --> 04:41.990
- Where's Gladys?

04:42.073 --> 04:44.492
- She went out with Miss Grant.
Why?

04:44.575 --> 04:46.327
- It isn't right, you know.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.830
Miss Grant may be nice,
but she's a jailer.

04:48.913 --> 04:52.000
And Gladys is a grown woman
whether you like it or not.

04:52.083 --> 04:55.211
Girls get married at her age.
- And live to regret it.

04:55.294 --> 04:57.463
I know what I'm doing, George.

04:59.799 --> 05:00.800
- I should go.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.014
- Were you expecting that?

05:06.097 --> 05:07.056
- No.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.768
But it doesn't surprise me.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.190
What are you trying to tell me?

05:16.274 --> 05:18.192
- There's no need to talk
as if I were your chauffeur.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.738
- When I've finished, you'll
wish you were my chauffeur.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.905
- You summoned me here.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.866
- You came
because if you had not,

05:24.949 --> 05:26.325
I would have turned up
at your place of business

05:26.409 --> 05:28.453
and shouted the truth
to anyone who'd listen,

05:28.536 --> 05:29.871
that the aldermen are liars

05:29.954 --> 05:31.581
and you have reneged
on your deal.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.708
- I've come to your office
at your request

05:33.791 --> 05:35.418
to show goodwill, Mr. Russell.

05:35.501 --> 05:37.295
I will not stay
and be insulted.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.964
But I agree.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.925
It is time you knew
public opinion has moved away

05:43.009 --> 05:43.968
from your position.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.637
- In other words,

05:46.721 --> 05:47.972
you all bought shares
on margin,

05:48.056 --> 05:50.183
passed the law,
and made a fat profit.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.851
Now I imagine
you've sold them short.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.186
And you mean to cancel
your own law,

05:53.269 --> 05:54.479
betting that the value
will plummet.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.439
Then you'll buy them again
when they hit rock bottom

05:56.522 --> 05:59.484
and in the process double or
triple your ill-gotten gains.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.444
- That is pure speculation.

06:01.527 --> 06:04.906
I don't even know
if we will cancel the law.

06:04.989 --> 06:08.868
But the idea of having
a new rail station

06:08.951 --> 06:11.287
in the city

06:11.370 --> 06:15.041
isn't as popular
as we'd hoped it might be.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.292
- I see.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.961
So you're really only concerned
with the common good.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.630
- The aldermen
are public servants.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.799
We must serve the public.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.929
- I didn't see this coming.

06:28.012 --> 06:28.971
I admit it.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.432
I thought you were
honorable men.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.143
Not too honorable
to miss the chance

06:34.227 --> 06:35.436
of a fat buck, of course,

06:35.520 --> 06:36.813
but not greedy, dirty thieves.

06:36.896 --> 06:37.939
- Mr. Russell.

06:38.022 --> 06:40.650
- I thought I was the one
who might throw a curveball.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.401
And now look.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.569
You've caught me out.

06:43.653 --> 06:46.781
[tense music]

06:46.864 --> 06:48.533
- Good day to you, Mr. Russell.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.744
- Good day to you, Mr. Morris.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.836
- It only remains to say

06:59.919 --> 07:02.338
that I hope you can see,
as I can,

07:02.421 --> 07:05.216
the vast possibilities
for building

07:05.299 --> 07:08.177
one of the grandest

07:08.261 --> 07:09.846

to support the establishment

07:20.731 --> 07:21.774
of an American Red Cross

07:21.858 --> 07:24.902
and President Garfield
never managed to sign either,

07:24.986 --> 07:27.363
what makes you think
you can find support now?

07:27.446 --> 07:29.198
- I'm afraid unfortunate events

07:29.282 --> 07:31.159
have altered things
in Washington.

07:31.242 --> 07:34.620
- And President Arthur
may be more enthusiastic?

07:34.704 --> 07:36.789
- I have reason to believe so,
yes.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.877
This has been
an introduction only.

07:40.960 --> 07:41.919

07:42.003 --> 07:43.796
- And I thank you

07:55.308 --> 07:57.226
She has already achieved
a great deal.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.770
And now at the head
of the American Red Cross,

07:59.854 --> 08:03.357
she is destined
to do a great deal more.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.908

08:11.991 --> 08:14.035
You are Miss Brook, I think.
Miss Ada Brook?

08:14.118 --> 08:17.705
- I am. And this is my niece,
Miss Marian Brook.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.082
- I am Cornelius Eckhard III.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.085
- [sighs] I thought it was you.

08:23.169 --> 08:26.339
- I'm afraid it's been too many
years for me to call you Ada?

08:26.422 --> 08:28.132
- But this is too touching.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.675
- Oh, not really.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.969
We knew each other
when we were young

08:32.053 --> 08:33.262
in Pennsylvania.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.599
- Before life drove us to
the four corners of the Earth.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.434
- Have you been
in New York for long?

08:38.517 --> 08:41.604
- No, I settled in Connecticut.
- Oh.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.856
- But now I have
nothing to hold me there.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.025
So I came to the city.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.735
- What brings you
to this gathering?

08:47.818 --> 08:49.445
An interest in the Red Cross?

08:49.528 --> 08:53.741
- Not entirely.
Mrs. Morris is my niece.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.117
And when she said
you'd be here,

08:55.201 --> 08:59.247
I was tempted to see if we
might revive an old friendship.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.207
- Not very old, surely.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.084
- How is your sister?

09:03.167 --> 09:05.127
What--what is she called now?

09:05.211 --> 09:09.465
- She married Mr. Van Rhijn
almost 40 years ago.

09:09.548 --> 09:10.675
- Ah.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.510
Please give her my regards.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.512
- He must call on us
and give them himself,

09:14.595 --> 09:18.641
mustn't he, Aunt Ada?
- [chuckles nervously]

09:18.724 --> 09:20.434
- Ladies.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.314
- Can we persuade you
to the cause?

09:25.398 --> 09:28.234
- I am persuaded,
but, once again,

09:28.317 --> 09:29.568
if it's money
Miss Barton needs,

09:29.652 --> 09:31.195
why don't we ask
Mrs. Russell?

09:31.279 --> 09:32.780
- Don't speak that name.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.950
- Perhaps not when Mrs. Astor's
in the room.

09:36.033 --> 09:37.326
- Mr. Morris tells me

09:37.410 --> 09:39.954
Mr. Russell has insulted him
disgracefully.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.539
- What? Why?

09:41.622 --> 09:44.417
- Why? Because he is not
a gentleman, my dear,

09:44.500 --> 09:46.419
as I keep telling you.

09:50.881 --> 09:53.551
- There may be
another side to it.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.928
- You are
too reasonable to live.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.763
Now I must see to my guests.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.226
- But how will they make money
when the stock falls?

10:02.310 --> 10:04.061
- Trust me, they will.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.147
And when they have fallen,
they'll buy them again,

10:06.230 --> 10:08.482
repass the law,
make a third fortune,

10:08.566 --> 10:10.318
and steal my company.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.111
I blame myself.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.362
My guard was down.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.197
- Can't you fight it?
- Not in court.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.657
It's not illegal.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.200
- There must be other ways.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.910
- If I do, I will have to put
a large part

10:19.994 --> 10:20.953
of our capital at risk.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.830
- Very well.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.415
- You understand
what I'm saying?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.919
All this
may be lost.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.171
- You've made it once.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.048
You can make it again
if you have to.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.055
- There are moments, my dear,
