NARRATOR: <i>Welcome to the Isle of Tortuga,</i>
<i>home to the most brutal pirate</i>

00:18.309 --> 00:22.731
<i>to ever have sailed the seven seas.</i>
<i>Her lust for battle knows no bounds.</i>

00:22.856 --> 00:25.400
<i>She is vicious, merciless. She is...</i>

<i>-...cooking.</i>

00:28.236 --> 00:30.739
Perfecting me conch chowder. (LAUGHS)

00:32.699 --> 00:34.784
Getting there. Needs basil.

00:34.909 --> 00:38.246
NARRATOR: <i>But what about the plundering?</i>
<i>The pillaging? The red-sailed ships stuck</i>

00:38.329 --> 00:41.499
<i>-in the seven seas?</i>
-(CHUCKLES) I'm a retired pirate now.

00:41.833 --> 00:46.337
Look, me crew even gave me a watch.

00:46.629 --> 00:49.340
NARRATOR:<i> Mm, but you were the only one</i>
<i>who could save Barbossa.</i>

00:50.425 --> 00:52.719
Wait. Captain Barbossa?

00:53.595 --> 00:57.474
"You best start believing
in ghost stories," Barbossa?

00:57.557 --> 01:00.393
NARRATOR: <i>He's being held hostage</i>
<i>by the East India Trading Company.</i>

01:00.852 --> 01:03.271
Oh, well, that's a ship
of a different color.

01:04.105 --> 01:09.694
Avast! Beware ye scurvy scum.
I shall sail to the edge of the world,

01:09.778 --> 01:12.238
and die a certain death
to free our good Captain.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.241
NARRATOR: <i>There she is. I knew retirement</i>
<i>didn't suit you.</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:19.079
Nay! Now if only we could find
a ship to commandeer.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.207
And a crew. But not just any crew.

01:22.957 --> 01:26.252
A cursed crew, with the strength
of the ocean.

-(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
-(GRUNTS)

01:28.671 --> 01:31.591
Inside this ye chest you'll find
everything you need

01:31.674 --> 01:33.885
-to bring me such a crew.
-NARRATOR: <i>Aye-aye, Captain.</i>

01:33.968 --> 01:36.805
<i>A ship and cursed crew</i>
<i>will be on the horizon soon.</i>

01:36.888 --> 01:38.431
<i>I know just who to call for help.</i>

01:38.515 --> 01:43.686
Don't let the sun set on your back, matey.
Move, move, move! (GRUNTS)

01:45.480 --> 01:47.107
NARRATOR: <i>Introducing</i>
<i>three exceptional teams</i>

01:47.607 --> 01:48.900
<i>of the world's best food artists.</i>

01:49.692 --> 01:53.613
<i>Monster Sculptors, a competitive trio</i>
<i>of carvers and food artists</i>

01:53.696 --> 01:55.281
<i>that are as close as family.</i>

01:56.032 --> 02:00.537
<i>Food Fighters, a determined team</i>
<i>of self-taught artists from a small town.</i>

02:01.037 --> 02:04.749
<i>And Confectionery Crew, a polished team</i>
<i>of professional pastry chefs</i>

02:13.716 --> 02:16.970
<i>And win the coveted Disney Foodtastic pin,</i>

<i>than buried treasure.</i>

02:20.181 --> 02:23.059
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

02:23.977 --> 02:25.603
That's enough, Davey Jones.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.480
-(ALL LAUGH, APPLAUD)
-(CHEERS)

02:28.606 --> 02:33.153
Ahoy there. Today, it's all hands-on deck.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.322
As we set sail on an adventure
like no other.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.034
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> started out
as a Disney Parks adventure,

02:40.201 --> 02:45.540
for those of us this tall to ride,
and bloomed into a beloved film franchise.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.627
Now,<i> Pirates of the Caribbean</i>
has influenced fashion, entertainment,

02:49.794 --> 02:53.173
and, today, it's going
to influence food art.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.592
Which is why we've asked
some very special people

02:55.675 --> 02:58.386
in the food art world to join us
on this mission.

02:59.304 --> 03:03.391
Let me just get something.
Okay, where are they?

03:03.474 --> 03:08.688
-(ALL LAUGH)
-Mm. Avast! There they are.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.108
-Amirah Kassem and Benny Rivera.
-Hi!

03:12.192 --> 03:15.111
-(ALL LAUGH)
-(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

03:15.195 --> 03:17.488
-Hey, guys.
-KEKE: Our food artists are gonna need

03:17.655 --> 03:21.075
every bit of your food art expertise
to bring this ship in!

03:22.076 --> 03:27.123
Now, speaking of ships, as we all
just saw, our pirate lass needs a boat,

03:27.498 --> 03:30.126
with a crew to rescue Barbossa.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.838
So, today, your challenge
will be to create a scene,

03:34.047 --> 03:37.550
on a pirate ship in the world
of<i> Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

03:38.092 --> 03:42.472
But that's not all. Your pirate crew
has a curse.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.475
-(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
-(THUNDER RUMBLING)

03:46.226 --> 03:48.311
-Uh-oh.
-(ALL LAUGH)

03:49.145 --> 03:50.563
KEKE: Now, you guys want treasure?

03:50.647 --> 03:53.691
Well, our pirate lass
has brought you treasure.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.319
(LAUGHS)

03:57.195 --> 03:59.155
What's in there, mate? (CHUCKLES)

04:01.241 --> 04:03.117
So, uh, what are you waiting for?

04:03.910 --> 04:04.953
-(GASPS)
-FEMALE VOICE: Oh.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.080
-Go for it.
-Oh, man!

04:07.163 --> 04:11.751
-(LAUGHING) Don't be shy.
-(GRUNTS) What?

04:11.918 --> 04:16.214
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

04:17.006 --> 04:18.716
-It's real.
-KEKE: Like the hexed gold

04:18.925 --> 04:21.135
Captain Barbossa wears around his neck,

04:21.219 --> 04:25.348
what's inside these chests will curse
three crew members on your ship.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.643
Now, I gotta ask you guys.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.521
What are you looking for out of all
of our teams today?

04:31.896 --> 04:34.857
-For me, it's about technical ability.
-Mm-hmm.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.319
It's so important to see you mastering
your craft.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.905
Now, what about you, Amirah?
What are you looking for?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.323
Creativity.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.659
How resourceful you're being
with the materials

04:44.742 --> 04:47.370
in your build can make or break
your presentation.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.540
And don't forget to take storytelling
into account.

04:50.873 --> 04:56.504
And, so you know, all the food you
don't use in your build will be donated.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.798
Nothing goes to waste on <i>Foodtastic.</i>

05:00.216 --> 05:03.636
Now, you've only got till sundown
to finish your ships.

05:04.220 --> 05:09.183
So once the sun sets over the horizon,
it's lights out. Got it?

05:09.434 --> 05:10.476
-Yeah.
-Yes.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.228
Are you guys ready?

05:12.395 --> 05:15.023
-CONTESTANTS: Yeah!
-All right. Let's set sail!

05:15.481 --> 05:16.941
FEMALE VOICE: Go, go, go.

05:18.776 --> 05:23.323
So I think we should go big,
go impactful, right?

05:23.573 --> 05:26.367
We can do a ship that's being invaded
by crabs.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.954
Mm-hmm. I think the pirates
should be cursed with the crab's traits.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.748
ADAM: And maybe even cursing the pirates

05:32.165 --> 05:33.624
-and turning them into crabs themselves.
-KATE: Yes.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.626
ADAM: Maybe he's getting turned
into a half-crab here.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.587
-AMANDA: Yeah.
-And the crab should really

05:37.670 --> 05:40.048
pop with lots of red and orange.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.383
-Cartoony faces and things like that.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.094
I think there should be one up
in the crow's nest too.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.180
ADAM: Oh, yeah, I like that.
Is that what that's called?

05:47.263 --> 05:48.765
-Yeah. Crow's nest.
-ADAM: Crow's nest?

05:49.223 --> 05:51.351
Kate, Amanda, and I met while working

05:51.434 --> 05:53.728
at a luxury five-star,
five-diamond resort.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.022
<i>Kate does all the cake decorating</i>
<i>at the resort.</i>

05:56.272 --> 05:59.442
<i>Amanda does all the chocolate work</i>
<i>and confectionery work.</i>

05:59.567 --> 06:01.736
<i>They're just fantastic.</i>
<i>And being head chef,</i>

06:01.903 --> 06:03.738
I'm honored every day to go in there
and lead the team.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.116
KATE: I think we should put some coral
and some shells.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.951
-Made out of chocolate?
-KATE: Yeah.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.329
ADAM: And we make
this real perfect chocolate sculpture.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.206
-Nice and shiny.
-KATE: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.458
<i>I think we could incorporate</i>
<i>the real crabs.</i>

06:15.541 --> 06:16.834
-ADAM: <i>Yeah</i>
-KATE: <i>Like they're also helping invade</i>

06:16.918 --> 06:18.211
<i>-the ship.</i>
-ADAM:<i> I like that.</i>

06:18.294 --> 06:21.089
<i>So the first thing they're gonna see</i>
<i>from afar is the giant ship.</i>

06:21.172 --> 06:23.549
<i>And then as they get closer, there's lots</i>
<i>of details and textures.</i>

06:23.633 --> 06:25.009
<i>-Big dramatic claws.</i>
-KATE: <i>Yeah.</i>

06:25.093 --> 06:26.135
ADAM:<i> Eyeballs coming out.</i>

06:26.302 --> 06:29.097
-I think ours is gonna be large.
-KATE: Big. I'm excited.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.306
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

06:31.724 --> 06:36.062
So I'm thinking, maybe they're gathered
around a table, all right?

06:36.396 --> 06:37.438
-And maybe...
-Holding a meeting.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.273
-Holding a pirate meeting.
-MAURICE: Yeah. I agree.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.775
Let's talk through this, right?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.819
DILL: So how big are we gonna make this?
Life-sized?

06:42.944 --> 06:45.613
-MAURICE: Yeah. Something like that.
-DILL: This is<i> Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

06:45.905 --> 06:47.240
Let's make sure
that they look like pirates

06:47.323 --> 06:49.450
and not like shrimp people
from Planet Shrimp.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.994
-(ALL LAUGH)
-We're self-taught.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.373
Just experience through working
at a grocery store

06:55.456 --> 06:58.251
<i>or at different local bakeries</i>
<i>around town.</i>

06:58.876 --> 07:01.754
<i>And now I own my own business,</i>
<i>making cakes.</i>

07:01.921 --> 07:02.964
I'm very passionate about it.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.133
I'm getting choked up just talking
about it right now.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.343
-(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)
-I think this looks pretty good.

07:07.427 --> 07:11.431
I think me and Maurice can handle doing
the three shrimp-cursed crewmen.

07:11.514 --> 07:15.184
<i>made from produce, fondant,</i>
<i>and different elements that we can find.</i>

07:15.601 --> 07:17.437
<i>They are holding a meeting on the top deck</i>

07:17.520 --> 07:20.273
<i>to discuss the plan</i>
<i>to save Captain Barbossa.</i>

07:20.773 --> 07:22.233
-Dee, can you handle the lanterns?
-DEE: Yes.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.902
-Yeah. I call it.
-With your isomalt skills, sugar work?

07:25.069 --> 07:26.737
-DEE: Yeah.
-DILL: All right. We got it.

07:28.614 --> 07:32.785
VIVIAN: We should have the ship.
Kind of like this, right?

07:33.119 --> 07:34.370
DEAN: We could make a bread ship.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.955
-(VIVIAN CHUCKLES)
-DEAN: I want this to be out of bread.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.332
Yeah. It's gonna be a carbalicious ship.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.251
DEAN: The characters need movement,
we know.

07:40.418 --> 07:44.505
We've done this before.
We've done competitions. Movement wins.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.341
VIVIAN: Why don't we have a chimp up here.
He has a compass...

07:47.425 --> 07:49.927
And then our three characters
could be trying to get the monkey,

07:50.011 --> 07:51.137
-who has the compass...
-Exactly.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.638
...so they can finish their adventure.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.640
VIVIAN: And then, Matt?
Why don't we do some waves?

07:54.765 --> 07:56.809
MATTHEW: Yeah. It would give
it some more motion.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.729
-I could make these waves out of ice.
-DEAN: That's another skill...

07:59.812 --> 08:01.355
-VIVIAN: Yeah, definitely.
-...that I don't think the other

08:01.439 --> 08:02.899
-teams have.
-VIVIAN: Yes.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.026
DEAN: Here's... I'm seeing all this,

08:05.401 --> 08:08.488
but do you think you can do
three characters all by yourself?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.907
-I'm doing all three?
-(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

08:11.324 --> 08:13.034
I think that they need to be cohesive,

08:13.117 --> 08:15.453
so if I do one and you do one,
they're gonna look different.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.956
VIVIAN: Shoot, then I should take
on the chimp.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.666
DEAN: That's an amazing idea.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.418
KEKE: Hey, hey, hey.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.045
-What's up, Monster Sculptors?
-Hey, guys.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.631
KEKE: All right. So, how did you
guys' team come together?

08:26.964 --> 08:29.842
Well, Vivian and I have done competition
stuff together.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.385
-VIVIAN: I know. Feel sorry for me.
-KEKE: Oh, no.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.970
-That's amazing.
-Feel so sorry for me.

08:33.262 --> 08:37.141
Our relationship would be defined
as a dysfunctional family.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.561
<i>It's like working with fire</i>
<i>and ice with us.</i>

08:40.645 --> 08:43.648
-(DEAN LAUGHING)
-VIVIAN: <i>We bicker and argue all the time.</i>

08:43.731 --> 08:47.610
But between Dean and I, there's nothing
that we can't do with food.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.738
KEKE: And what about you, Matthew?
You just joined in now?

08:50.821 --> 08:53.783
Yup. I grew up pretty much seeing
Dean sculpt ice...

08:53.866 --> 08:54.992
-Oh, wow.
-...and I got into it.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.119
-So I've been doing ice for 12 years now.
-I've known him

08:57.203 --> 08:59.705
-since he was shorter than me, so...
-(ALL LAUGH)

08:59.789 --> 09:03.918
All right. How are you gonna help
our retired pirate save Captain Barbossa?

09:04.085 --> 09:07.296
Our idea is to stand out and be different
than the other teams.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.923
-Okay.
-VIVIAN: So we decided to

09:09.632 --> 09:12.385
-do a cross section of a pirate ship.
-BENNY: <i>Okay, got it.</i>

09:12.468 --> 09:14.845
VIVIAN: <i>And we kind of wanna make</i>
<i>it just like the movie,</i>

09:14.929 --> 09:19.767
<i>so we have a chimp up here</i>
<i>with a compass to find Barbossa.</i>

09:19.850 --> 09:23.521
<i>And then the crewmen are down here</i>
<i>trying to get the compass,</i>

09:23.604 --> 09:25.356
<i>because that points to what you want</i>
<i>the most.</i>

09:25.523 --> 09:29.443
I have this crazy idea to have clothing
as leafy greens.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.156
-She's usually right.
-Yeah.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.533
-Wait. Say it again. Say it again.
-Always right.

09:35.616 --> 09:36.742
-She wants to hear it.
-VIVIAN: What was...

09:36.909 --> 09:37.952
-Once is enough.
-What was that?

09:38.035 --> 09:39.579
-Once is enough.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

09:39.662 --> 09:40.663
-See you, guys.
-Thanks, guys.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.082
-Thanks, guys. See you. Good luck.
-MATTHEW: Thank you.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.585
-Let's go pillage the pantry, guys.
-VIVIAN: Yes.

Ooh, there's so many things.

Where's the bread at? Where's the bread?

Okay. Okay. Okay. Brown. Brown.
Brown. Brown. Ooh! Three browns.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.144
Just grab all of them.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.563
KATE: I got the desiccated coconuts
for the crabs.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.608
-AMANDA: (GASPING) There's cocoa nibs.
-Let's grab these.

10:09.483 --> 10:10.735
DILL: I'll grab all these sheets.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.487
-Gettin' a bicep workout.
-VIVIAN: Let's bounce.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.825
MAURICE: Don't we gotta like,
taste everything to make sure it's edible?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.410
Maybe later.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.412
All right. Why don't you establish
this area for your...

10:21.495 --> 10:23.539
-Yes. Okay.
-...fondant work?

10:23.706 --> 10:25.666
ADAM: This, I think, would make
a good chocolate station.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.670
We work at the longest running
five-star resort in the country.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.380
So we're bringing that integrity with us.

10:31.547 --> 10:33.007
-Sheet the fondant.
-KATE: I'm about to.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.550
-Yup.
-ADAM: And then cast some chocolate.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.926
<i>We've been working together</i>
<i>for a few years,</i>

10:36.010 --> 10:37.803
and we've got a good work chemistry.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.430
Very good, Chef.

10:39.513 --> 10:43.851
When it's time to focus on work,
we all hustle and we all get the job done.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.102
And we all have each other's back,

10:45.186 --> 10:48.147
-which I think is very important.
-I agree.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.774
-Hey, Amanda.
-Yeah.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.734
Why don't you go ahead and cast some
in there.

10:51.859 --> 10:54.320
We've got a rough timeline
that we're working with,

10:54.403 --> 10:58.199
so we've got a little checklist. You know,
we're chefs. We like organization.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.868
So if we can stick to that checklist
and we can be within

11:00.951 --> 11:03.120
about 20 percent of the timing,
I think we're okay.

11:03.204 --> 11:08.668
For the coral, we are going to be using
a fun and traditional technique.

11:09.293 --> 11:11.045
All right. So we'll make some coral.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.882
It's really... Now pay attention,
it's very, very complicated.

11:21.430 --> 11:22.515
Pour chocolate on ice.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.601
-Yeah. We got coral.
-AMANDA: Looks good.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.111
How you feeling, Matt?
Are you carbed out?

11:35.528 --> 11:36.904
-Not yet.
-(GIGGLES)

11:37.863 --> 11:40.449
This is my first time actually working
with bread so it's a little bit different.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.702
Really just kind of some of the sketches
we're going through,

11:42.785 --> 11:44.995
I kind of understood the concept,
but actually seeing it in person now

11:45.162 --> 11:47.665
and seeing this kind of come together,
I'm so excited.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.835
So we're gonna cover all of this
in really cool baguette

11:51.168 --> 11:53.170
and make it look like wood.
And then I'm gonna finish

11:53.254 --> 11:55.297
this last little bread piece here,
and then I'm gonna go change

11:55.381 --> 11:56.549
into my ice gear.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.843
VIVIAN: Dean, how's it going?

11:59.093 --> 12:01.095
DEAN: Pretty good.
I'm on the second palm tree.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.263
VIVIAN: Nice.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.140
I got a couple of tortillas I rolled up.

12:04.223 --> 12:07.101
I'm doing a treasure map.
Since, we're on a pirate's boat,

12:07.184 --> 12:08.185
there's gotta be a treasure map.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.940
We are planning on putting
this on the mast.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.568
So it tells part of the story.

12:15.735 --> 12:20.322
I hadn't done tortillas before.
I have done big murals on toasts before.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.949
<i>But never in a tortilla.</i>

12:22.533 --> 12:24.827
Vivian, you happy with that?
Does it read from over there?

12:24.910 --> 12:25.911
Cool.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.252
DEE: So, about this big for the eyes?
I mean, the shrimp eyes?

12:33.335 --> 12:35.296
Go for it. Do all the eyes.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.799
DEE: <i>Right now, I'm making</i>

12:42.553 --> 12:45.806
I started working
in a grocery store bakery.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.435
<i>And a lot of the competitors here</i>

12:49.602 --> 12:53.397
<i>They're chefs. And it's great to go</i>

12:53.814 --> 12:57.026
But I'm proud of, like, learning
on my own.

-MAURICE: It's an eyeball.

-You think so, but really it's the C.

-DEE: Oh, yes.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.790
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

13:10.873 --> 13:14.210
We are using white chocolate and hoping

13:14.293 --> 13:18.088
it'll harden in enough time for us
to start decorating it.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.924
DEE: How you're just painting that on,
it looks crazy.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.634
Ain't got time to be pretty.
These aren't...

13:22.551 --> 13:24.220
these aren't princesses. They're pirates.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.430
-AMIRAH: Food Fighters.
-Hey.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.265
How is it looking? How is it going?

13:28.599 --> 13:32.061
This was like a big experiment for us.
We added some chocolate.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.064
So hopefully that should just stabilize
this whole region.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.067
Why white chocolate? Because I tend
to find

13:38.150 --> 13:39.443
that when I'm working with chocolate

13:39.610 --> 13:41.445
white chocolate
is a milkier chocolate

13:41.529 --> 13:45.032
so it has... it's more of a liquid
versus a darker chocolate,

13:45.115 --> 13:47.243
-which hardens and, you know...
-BENNY: Hmm.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.704
...is a little more binding
than a white chocolate.

13:50.871 --> 13:51.914
So that's...

13:53.374 --> 13:56.001
-So that's a good question.
-It's a good question. Next question.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.962
-(ALL LAUGH)
-Next question.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.630
We have to be a little bit careful
with that.

13:59.713 --> 14:00.840
-Remember gravity.
-MAURICE: Yeah.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.510
Gravity. Yeah. No, this is it.
It's gonna be the biggest thing.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.221
But, yeah, if we can pull it off,
it's gonna be amazing, you know?

14:07.346 --> 14:09.056
It's falling off while we're talking
about it.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.724
-I know. Exactly.
-(LAUGHS)

14:10.808 --> 14:12.893
DILL: <i>I've never worked</i>
<i>with this much stuff at once.</i>

14:13.060 --> 14:16.188
Usually when I'm making something,
it doesn't get looked at by judges.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.648
(LAUGHS)

14:17.731 --> 14:19.817
MAURICE: <i>Yeah, you don't have your idols</i>
<i>like looking over your shoulder,</i>

14:19.900 --> 14:23.404
being like, "You know, white chocolate,
you know, what's the deal with that?"

14:23.779 --> 14:26.073
So let's go ahead and stabilize this area,
man.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.575
-DILL: Cool.
-All right. Thanks, guys.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.326
Excited to watch it come together.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.252
Right now, the white chocolate is putting
us behind.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.879
Can we switch on the other characters?

14:40.421 --> 14:42.548
-With dark chocolate?
-Okay. Sure.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.633
And we're just gonna start running
out of time

14:44.717 --> 14:47.303
if we don't start covering this build
with everything that we can.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.684
-ADAM: What do you got?
-I got desiccated coconut

14:53.767 --> 14:55.394
for the texture for the crabs.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.897
I got orange, red fondant.

With this being a little bit more
an organic sculpture,

16:35.327 --> 16:38.831

of some stuff I've done in the past.

this squid into the block.

the faces, the arms, and the legs,

out of modeling chocolate,
and have a rice cereal treat base.

BENNY: Yes.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.266
They are the one who are giving
us the whole ship scene.

19:02.432 --> 19:03.642
-Yeah.
-Which is what you asked for.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.146
-Presentation to me is everything.
-BENNY: Mm-hmm.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.983
When I saw the chocolate earlier,
I was concerned with the high gloss.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.861
You have to think about the color pallet
of the movie

19:14.278 --> 19:17.990
and that would instantly inspire me
to do things that are,

19:18.073 --> 19:20.409
you know, little bit salty and edgy.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.286
And for me, you know,
with <i>Pirates of the Caribbean,</i>

19:22.369 --> 19:24.246
it has so much realism.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.623
So, when I'm looking at that ship,
it's like, "Yeah, it's a ship.

19:26.707 --> 19:30.294
I see it as a ship," but it does not give
me that same realism.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.046
-I'm hoping that ship comes around.
-We'll see.

19:33.297 --> 19:36.717

-Yeah. I'm worried for Vivian.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.228
BENNY: She's feeling the pressure.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.690
You know, they have such specific roles.
If you take over all the characters...

19:51.857 --> 19:54.902
-KEKE: That's gonna take a lot of time.
-AMIRAH: There's just a lot left to do.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.946

they're going to come together.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.537
But did you see that when I...
we asked them about

20:05.621 --> 20:07.706
white chocolate versus the dark chocolate,

20:07.789 --> 20:10.459
they were a little stunned,
so it seems like it's a little bit

20:10.584 --> 20:11.752
of a trial and error.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.837
BENNY: The chocolate
is working really well.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.422
It's actually looking good.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.008
AMIRAH: Look, the rice cereal
is actually holding up.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.803
Well, I'm excited to see, you guys.
I feel like we are in for a ride.

20:21.970 --> 20:25.224
-A <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> ride. (LAUGHS)
-Exactly. (LAUGHS)

20:25.432 --> 20:27.559

20:27.643 --> 20:30.020
NARRATOR: <i>As the food artists</i>
<i>set sail creating their ships</i>

20:30.103 --> 20:34.942
<i>and cursed crewmates, our retired pirate</i>
<i>awaits help back on the dock.</i>

20:35.067 --> 20:36.068
(KEKE GRUNTING)

20:36.193 --> 20:38.195
NARRATOR: <i>Your ship will be soon</i>
<i>at your command, Captain.</i>

20:38.403 --> 20:42.115
Well done, me first mate.
Aye, we make ready to set sail

20:42.199 --> 20:45.369
the seven seas and free our dear
Captain Barbossa.

20:45.786 --> 20:49.164
Board the crew. There will be no quarter
given to our enemies.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.000
We make to sea. Batten down the cannons.

20:52.251 --> 20:56.588
NARRATOR: <i>Right. Well, about the cannons.</i>
<i>There be no cannons to batten down.</i>

20:57.172 --> 20:58.757
What do you mean no cannons?

20:59.216 --> 21:03.136
Make no mistake, we are setting sail
into the very heart of the enemy,

21:03.220 --> 21:07.975
and you think it wise to enter the fray,
nary a cannon to be found?

21:08.225 --> 21:10.227
NARRATOR:<i> I mean, when you put it</i>
<i>that way.</i>

21:10.310 --> 21:14.273
Please tell me you can plunder up
some firepower to get this thing done.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.025
NARRATOR: <i>You're saying you want me ask</i>
<i>if me mateys can get us cannons?</i>

21:17.192 --> 21:19.319
Cannons, matey. Cannons the likes

21:19.403 --> 21:22.072
of which the pirate lords
of old have never seen.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.408
NARRATOR: <i>Right. Yes, Captain.</i>
<i>Straight away.</i>

21:24.491 --> 21:27.953
Run, you bilge-suckling scallywag, run!

21:30.414 --> 21:34.084
-Oh, snap. Here's the judges.
-All right, artists, listen up.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.420
-(EXPLOSIONS)
-KEKE: We're under attack.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.465
This swashbuckling story just
got crazier

21:40.549 --> 21:42.217
because now the plot thickens.

21:42.384 --> 21:46.096
Okay? In order to come out victorious
in a battle with other pirates,

21:46.263 --> 21:49.933
your ships and your crew need firepower
to fight back.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.143
Holy Toledo!

21:51.226 --> 21:54.521
You need to add something explosive
to your foodscapes.

21:54.688 --> 21:58.233
A cannon blast to be specific,
or else we're sunk.

21:58.483 --> 22:02.779
Now, the sun is still high, but the sunset
isn't too far away.

22:02.946 --> 22:07.826
So get to the pantry and grab
some firepower, so you can add that blast.

22:08.243 --> 22:11.872
-Go!
-(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

22:13.582 --> 22:15.876

Viv. You want a little one?

22:15.959 --> 22:17.627
-MATTHEW: Yeah. Let's go with little.
-VIVIAN: Yes, smart idea.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.254
-DEAN: Let's go with little.
-Big one? Little one?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.673
-DEE: Oh, yes, big.
-I guess, big. We're pretty big.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.051
-ADAM: Let's get a big one.
-AMANDA: We definitely need a big one.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.886
It's gonna be more impactful.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.721
-VIVIAN: Anything else?
-Oh, some of that moss.

22:27.804 --> 22:29.222
And some of these sea beans.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.682
DEE: Oh, I'm gonna take a bunch of this.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.892
-All right.
-I'll take some of that.

-KATE: <i>Yes, Chef.</i>
-(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

22:50.118 --> 22:53.622
I'm excited for the cannon.
I think it's gonna add to the ship a lot.

22:53.705 --> 22:54.706
Yeah.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.666
DILL: I ain't worried about no cannon
right now. (CHUCKLES)

22:56.750 --> 22:58.001
We got people to make.

22:58.418 --> 23:01.630
We're running out of time.
Some of our stuff isn't finished yet.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.800
<i>We don't even have our characters done.</i>
<i>Our floor isn't done.</i>

23:05.175 --> 23:07.052
And now we have to worry about a cannon.

23:08.428 --> 23:10.764
We're gonna just keep building on
everything that we have planned on

23:10.847 --> 23:12.641
before and we're gonna do the cannon last.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.685
<i>So we're just gonna tack it on over here</i>
<i>in the corner by this chair.</i>

23:16.144 --> 23:17.312
<i>Hopefully, it all goes good.</i>

23:19.064 --> 23:20.399
DEAN: Sea beans, they're so salty.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.276
-VIVIAN: You ate it?
-DEAN: Yeah, delicious.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.695
-VIVIAN: Try this one too.
-DEAN: I ain't trying that. That's moss.

23:25.779 --> 23:26.863
(ALL LAUGH)

23:26.947 --> 23:28.740
MATTHEW: Okay, guys. If the treasure chest
is on one side,

23:28.824 --> 23:30.158
-what if we put that on the other side?
-VIVIAN: Yeah.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.701
MATTHEW: So that it still kind
of correlates.

23:31.827 --> 23:32.911
VIVIAN: I think we should put...

23:32.994 --> 23:34.621
MATTHEW: Because we'll have
the other two guys here.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.332
We really didn't plan to have
that tied into our storyline,

23:37.416 --> 23:39.793
so it's gonna be interesting to see
where this goes.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.545
DEAN: I got a great idea to cover
the cannon.

23:41.711 --> 23:44.172
Nori seaweed and some gelatin.
It looks like wrought iron.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.341
-VIVIAN: <i>Yes, yes.</i>
-DEAN:<i> And then we'll taro root</i>

23:46.425 --> 23:47.843
<i>on the base. It looks like wood.</i>

23:48.176 --> 23:49.845
-We'll just skin these off.
-VIVIAN: Yes.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.055
DEAN: Overlap them on that.

23:53.473 --> 23:54.683
VIVIAN: Wow.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.480
Right now, I'm just putting some bok choy
on the mantis.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.775
To separate what they're wearing
and the differences in each one.

24:03.859 --> 24:07.446
MAURICE: We'll be using leafy greens.
It gives it more of a fresh look.

24:07.779 --> 24:11.241
They got bok choy going on over there
on the Food Fighters.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.160
I like that combination together.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.704
VIVIAN: Dude, you guys’ build looks
so awesome.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.414
DILL: Thanks. I love y'all's.

24:17.497 --> 24:21.084
-You know, great mind thinks alike.
-DILL: You got that veggie on deck.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.544
(WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

24:22.919 --> 24:25.797
Right now, I'm heating up isomalt
so I can make

24:25.881 --> 24:29.843
the panes of glass for the lantern.
You have to get the isomalt

24:29.926 --> 24:32.971
to a certain temperature. After that,
you have to let it cool down

24:33.054 --> 24:35.348
just a little bit just to where
the bubbles dissipate.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.893
-And then you can pour.
-Don't burn me.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.519
I'll try not to.

24:39.686 --> 24:40.854
-That's good.

-Yes.

-DILL: Why? Which one?
-DEE: I mean, it's a look.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.528
DILL: Can I do something? Can I do
anything? Okay. I'm gonna let you...

24:48.612 --> 24:50.030
DEE: No, it's fine.

24:50.113 --> 24:51.865
<i>The lantern is part of the story...</i>

<i>so I feel like if I don't finish</i>
<i>and make it look good,</i>

24:55.660 --> 24:57.162
<i>then it'll affect our story.</i>

24:58.121 --> 25:01.458
There she goes.
I see a lot of imperfections.

25:01.708 --> 25:05.086
If you're an artist, you're gonna be hard
on yourself. You're gonna critique,

25:05.295 --> 25:07.631
you know, all your stuff.
You know where your flaws are at.

25:07.714 --> 25:10.675
Even if some people don't see that,
you know they're there.

25:11.009 --> 25:15.555
I feel like my art makes me who I am.
I really don't know who I am... (LAUGHS)

25:15.680 --> 25:18.183
...without, like, making cool things.
Like, I really don't.

on these things.

and I'm gonna age it a little bit more.

<i>by the crab invasion.</i>

pectin, gelatin, alcohol.

-KATE: Yes.

I really like the skull.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.644
not from our town.

to use all sorts of Asian ingredients

26:48.648 --> 26:51.318
that's never been seen before.
Right, Dean?

26:51.401 --> 26:53.695
Yup. Vivian, do you know what this is?

-VIVIAN: A taro.
-It's a vulture. (LAUGHS)

'cause you keep on making me stop doing

All righty. Let's go check on Vivian.
Now, we see you steady at work, Viv.

Yeah. If I wasn't in cakes,
I'll be a fashionista. (CHUCKLES)

27:55.382 --> 27:57.008
I'm a little worried about the time.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.388
So do you think you will be able
to kind of like finish

28:01.471 --> 28:04.307
-all the details that you're looking for?
-There's a lot of pressure just

28:04.391 --> 28:06.518
because in what we don't make up in size,

28:06.601 --> 28:08.687
-we need to make up in details and...
-AMIRAH: Yes.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.105

-Correct. Can you handle

-the pressure?
-VIVIAN: The pressure is on.

28:12.732 --> 28:14.067

-Okay.

<i>We're gonna get there. We will put in</i>
<i>the work and we'll get it done.</i>

29:17.756 --> 29:20.675
DEAN: All right, Vivian,
I'll pour last two windowpanes here

29:20.759 --> 29:24.471
for the Captain's quarter door.
I heated up the isomalt.

29:24.971 --> 29:27.056
Makes it look like old stained glass.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.524
VIVIAN: So I'm working on the chimp.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.902
I'm sculpting him out
of modeling chocolate.

29:39.068 --> 29:41.279
So once I'm finished
with the chimp's head,

29:41.488 --> 29:43.323
I will finish the crewmen.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.576
And, of course, the squid.
We haven't even...

29:46.659 --> 29:49.662
Oh, my gosh. We haven't even done anything
with the squid yet.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.581
DEAN: Vivian, do you see the sun
over there?

29:51.873 --> 29:53.625
-VIVIAN: I do see the sun.
-It's touching the tip of the mast.

29:54.083 --> 29:58.129
These characters have so many details
and Dean is already, you know, rushing me.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.422
What do you think, Dean?

29:59.839 --> 30:02.509
-DEAN: I just want them done.
-VIVIAN: I know. Sorry.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.887
(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

30:05.970 --> 30:10.642
Oh. The sound of seagulls circling
overhead can only mean one thing.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.520
They're about to swoop down
and steal something from your builds.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.104
-(LAUGHS)
-(CHUCKLING) Wait, no.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.774
It means that two teams
are about to walk the plank.

30:18.149 --> 30:21.027
You're almost out of time, guys.
It's just one more hour left

30:21.110 --> 30:25.114
before sunset. It's time to start thinking
about your finishing touches.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.242
-Get to it.
-Get to work. (IMITATES WHIP CRACK)

30:27.408 --> 30:29.285
(LAUGHS)

30:31.663 --> 30:33.039
-(GRUNTS)
<i>-The sun's almost down.</i>

30:33.122 --> 30:35.375
<i>I really gotta add the shrimp and get</i>
<i>that cannon covered.</i>

30:35.750 --> 30:38.211
We just had to use the buttercream
to make some kind of cool texture.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.004
I'm gonna just toss some gold on it.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.882
This is the most expensive cannon
in the world.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.927
I'm kind of happy with it actually.
I'm proud.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.470
-DEE: You're gonna add the shrimp?
-DILL: Yeah.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.764
DEE: I wish we could have thought
of a more creative way to use it.

30:49.889 --> 30:50.932
DILL: We just didn't have time.

30:51.015 --> 30:53.601
What would be a creative way
to use these guys? Shoulder pads?

30:54.102 --> 30:55.562
Let's make some shoulder pads.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.772
DEE: I'm gonna put one in the hat
'cause I can.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.316
DILL: Man, never gonna take shrimp
for granted again.

31:01.442 --> 31:04.153
-KATE: Call me the Crustacean Queen.
-ADAM: Are you cracking jokes over there?

31:04.237 --> 31:05.572
MATTHEW: I'm gonna pull the ice out
and get it set.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.658
-DEAN: Yeah.
-VIVIAN: Okay. I'm done.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.828
All right, guys. Take a step back
and just take a last second look.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.663
DEAN: She doesn't have hair,
so she's all right.

31:13.830 --> 31:14.873
-She's okay.
-He's got the sword.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.126
-She's got the banana. He got the bird.
-VIVIAN: Monkey's up there.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.503
-Rolling with the punches.
-KEKE: All right, you guys.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.922
One minute till sunset.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.676
-ADAM: One minute.
-AMANDA: Yes, Chef.

31:26.759 --> 31:29.137
-(GRUNTS)
-(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

31:29.220 --> 31:30.221
ADAM: Mercy, mercy.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.850
-MATTHEW: Is that where you want it?
-DEAN: Yeah.

31:35.518 --> 31:37.687
-DEAN: What else, guys?
-VIVIAN: Just put it. Yeah.

31:38.062 --> 31:40.940
KATE: Last character. Of course,
it's the tallest.

31:41.232 --> 31:45.612
Time's almost up! Five seconds
until sundown.

31:47.488 --> 31:51.367
Three, two... one!

31:51.534 --> 31:54.787
Food artists, the sun is down
and time is up.

31:54.871 --> 31:56.372
-MALE VOICE: Yeah!
-(ALL CHEERING)

31:56.539 --> 31:57.999
Good job. Yeah!

31:58.082 --> 32:00.043
-Monster Sculptors.
-Roar.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.211
-DILL: Good job, Food Fighters.
-Dee.

32:02.378 --> 32:05.131
(LAUGHS) She don't wanna touch me.
I got fish hands.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.342
-(CHEERS)
-(LAUGHS)

32:07.425 --> 32:10.970
-Yes, we got it done.
-(EXCLAIMS) Wow.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.181
-KATE: There we go.
-Good job.

32:13.723 --> 32:17.810
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-KEKE: Ahoy there, Amanda, Kate, and Adam.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.228
-Welcome.
-BENNY: Hello.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.939
How do you guys feel about everything?

32:21.105 --> 32:23.983
-Oh, my gosh. We feel relieved.
-AMANDA: Yeah.

32:24.067 --> 32:27.487
I can't believe we actually pulled it off
in the time we had. (CHUCKLES)

32:27.654 --> 32:30.782
-Let's talk about the story.
-(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

32:37.038 --> 32:40.208
-(WOMAN GASPING)
-(ALL LAUGH)

32:40.833 --> 32:44.087
KATE: <i>So we have crabs that have boarded</i>
<i>the pirate ship,</i>

32:44.170 --> 32:45.838
-The Grinning Skull.
-KEKE: Ooh!

32:45.922 --> 32:49.968
KATE: <i>And they are cursing these pirates</i>
<i>because they're wanting to find out</i>

32:50.176 --> 32:51.594
<i>Hector Barbossa's whereabouts.</i>

32:52.470 --> 32:56.391
<i>The captain is starting to transform</i>
<i>and his body's like halfway there.</i>

32:56.557 --> 33:00.186
<i>This pirate over here is terrified</i>
<i>because he's starting to turn into a crab.</i>

33:00.395 --> 33:03.439
<i>And then we have one</i>
<i>that's trying to abandon ship.</i>

33:03.523 --> 33:05.692
<i>The crabs and three pirates</i>

33:05.775 --> 33:07.527
<i>are made out of fondant</i>
<i>and modeling chocolate.</i>

33:07.860 --> 33:10.363
ADAM: <i>Coming down the side of the ship,</i>
<i>we got many different textures</i>

33:10.446 --> 33:13.157
<i>of food and baked items.</i>
<i>We even use tortillas.</i>

33:13.324 --> 33:14.993
<i>We poured some isomalt for the windows.</i>

33:15.368 --> 33:18.746
<i>And we've got this really dramatic</i>
<i>textured sail that's made</i>

33:18.830 --> 33:20.665
<i>out of some corn husks and gold leaf.</i>

33:21.499 --> 33:23.001
AMANDA: <i>For the bowsprit, we used</i>

33:23.084 --> 33:27.046
<i>chocolate fèves and bars</i>
<i>that we scratched for texture</i>

33:27.130 --> 33:29.132
<i>and added gold luster dust too.</i>

33:30.591 --> 33:33.302
<i>And we do have</i>
<i>the white chocolate coral as well.</i>

33:33.469 --> 33:35.513
ADAM: <i>We were very surprised</i>
<i>to get real seafood.</i>

33:36.055 --> 33:38.683
<i>We have a few claws here,</i>
<i>and we were really satisfied with that</i>

33:38.766 --> 33:41.310
<i>'cause it adds to that dramatic head</i>
<i>of the ship.</i>

33:41.894 --> 33:45.106
KATE: <i>A cannon is hiding a little bit</i>
<i>behind the mast.</i>

33:45.189 --> 33:48.192
<i>The pirates are going to set off</i>

33:48.276 --> 33:51.654
<i>the cannon as a cry for help</i>
<i>to the surrounding ships.</i>

33:51.904 --> 33:54.657
First of all, I absolutely love
the storytelling.

33:54.741 --> 33:58.369
And it really looks like the ship
is under attack in live action.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.998
You have so many different crabs.
I mean, that one's really angry.

34:02.081 --> 34:04.250
<i>-This one's ready to get the captain.</i>
-(CONTESTANTS LAUGHING)

34:04.375 --> 34:06.753
AMIRAH: <i>Someone's even conquering,</i>
<i>you know, the top of the mast.</i>

34:06.836 --> 34:10.757
And the captain really is freaking out.
I mean, "Help me!"

34:10.965 --> 34:13.009
-(LAUGHING) Yeah.
-BENNY: As an overall look,

34:13.301 --> 34:15.303
<i>the scale is just impressive.</i>

34:15.803 --> 34:18.931
<i>I see some piping work.</i>
<i>I see some chocolate work.</i>

34:19.265 --> 34:22.060
<i>I love the textures</i>
<i>and the chocolate panels.</i>

34:22.351 --> 34:23.561
But I will probably

34:23.644 --> 34:26.647
have done some of the details
in a different way.

34:26.731 --> 34:30.860
For example, this skull is too shiny.
I love the top front piece

34:31.069 --> 34:33.279
<i>because of the texture that you add</i>
<i>into the side,</i>

34:33.362 --> 34:35.448
<i>it looks more natural.</i>
<i>Do you see the difference?</i>

34:35.531 --> 34:36.949
-AMANDA: <i>Yes.</i>
-Let's talk about color.

34:37.408 --> 34:40.745
I would have probably gone
with a more realistic pirates,

34:40.828 --> 34:42.246
<i>dark and dirty.</i>

34:42.413 --> 34:44.749
BENNY: It's important, that look
that the bone normally have

34:44.916 --> 34:47.251
-because of its natural colors.
-Mm-hmm.

34:47.335 --> 34:52.131
I love that you chose the corn husk
because it does have the natural color

34:52.298 --> 34:54.801
<i>-of a sail.</i>
-BOTH: Thank you.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.886
-KEKE: Really great job, you guys.
-KATE: Thank you.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.805
Wishing you the best of luck.
Thank you so much.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.098
BOTH: Thank you.

35:00.556 --> 35:04.060
This is incredible. Y'all scaled it all
the way up with the shrimp.

35:04.143 --> 35:05.978
I mean, I ain't never seen
a shrimp this large.

35:06.062 --> 35:08.064
-(ALL LAUGH)
-It's definitely a shrimp dream.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.983
-So relieved.
-We are very relieved that it came out

35:11.067 --> 35:12.360
looking like what we wanted it
to look like.

35:12.527 --> 35:16.030
-Dill, tell us what the story is here.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.251
DILL: <i>We have a shrimp captain,</i>

35:28.334 --> 35:30.962
<i>who's called a meeting</i>
<i>with their shrimp mates.</i>

35:32.255 --> 35:35.675
<i>Made from produce and fondant.</i>
<i>We have a tortilla hat.</i>

35:35.758 --> 35:37.260
<i>And then the top is just a cantaloupe</i>

35:37.343 --> 35:39.011
<i>-smashed on top to hold it.</i>
-BENNY:<i> That's awesome.</i>

35:39.637 --> 35:42.098
DILL: <i>They're looking at the map to try</i>
<i>to figure out a good route</i>

35:42.181 --> 35:44.475
<i>to save Captain Barbossa.</i>

35:45.518 --> 35:48.020
DEE: <i>The lamp is gum paste and isomalt.</i>

35:48.521 --> 35:51.732
DILL: <i>Not everybody has the same feeling,</i>
<i>so one guy's a little more chilled out,</i>

35:52.233 --> 35:54.819
one guy's a little angrier.
He's also a little trigger-happy.

35:54.902 --> 35:56.571
-(GASPS)
-DILL: (LAUGHING) <i>He's gonna light</i>

35:56.654 --> 35:59.615
<i>that cannon and it's gonna go off</i>
<i>'cause that's just the kind of guy he is.</i>

36:01.075 --> 36:03.536
DEE: <i>The shrimp character's eyes</i>
<i>are made out of isomalt.</i>

36:04.954 --> 36:07.498
DILL: <i>So we put the shrimp,</i>
<i>kind of all over the place.</i>

36:07.707 --> 36:09.792
<i>Kind of like they're living there.</i>
<i>Like a friendly little creature.</i>

36:10.376 --> 36:13.713
The great thing about this story
is that they are very scary.

36:13.796 --> 36:14.797
-(CHUCKLES)
-Thank you.

36:14.964 --> 36:19.260
The faces on the creatures
are just really in that pirate's world.

36:19.343 --> 36:23.097
I love the use of carrots
because they are looking like tentacles.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.266
And I just really enjoy that, right.

36:25.349 --> 36:28.352
The whimsicalness
of matching two things together.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.981
And I think story-wise, I would have loved
to see shrimp either being part

36:32.064 --> 36:34.775
of the story or being part
of the materials

36:34.859 --> 36:36.569
that we're actually using on them.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.487
I do love the ones on the hat.
I feel like...

36:38.571 --> 36:40.573
-DILL: Yeah.
-...it's like a feather in the hat.

36:40.656 --> 36:44.076
-DILL: Right.
-Lettuce is a good choice for the outfits.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.330
<i>However, what I had probably done</i>
<i>different is just like the way</i>

36:47.413 --> 36:51.667
that you place them. Right now,
he just looks like a sea of lettuce.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.002
-Right.
-DEE: Mm-hmm.

36:53.085 --> 36:55.880
Now, the lantern. Let's talk
about that beautiful piece.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.759
DEE: <i>Around it, it's gum paste.</i>
<i>There's isomalt panes</i>

36:59.842 --> 37:02.094
<i>and there's just gum paste sightings.</i>

37:02.511 --> 37:05.181
BENNY:<i> I can see some cracks</i>
<i>on the isomalt.</i>

37:05.348 --> 37:06.849
-Yeah. That's a look.
-BENNY: But, hey.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.227
It works perfectly,
because it's an old ship.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.979
<i>It's just like</i>
<i>the </i>Pirates of the Caribbean, <i>dark colors.</i>

37:12.063 --> 37:13.898
-DEE: <i>Hmm.</i>
-BENNY: <i>In general, it looks stunning.</i>

37:14.065 --> 37:16.567
-KEKE: Yes! I love that.
-Thank you. (CHUCKLES)

37:16.651 --> 37:18.277

37:38.589 --> 37:40.132
-KEKE: All right!
-(LAUGHS)

37:40.758 --> 37:45.805
In order to rescue Captain Barbossa,
they need the compass.

37:46.847 --> 37:50.309
MATTHEW: <i>And our ship's in the middle</i>
<i>of a storm, this raging sea.</i>

37:50.434 --> 37:53.729
<i>Then it's causing crazy waves.</i>
<i>Like, our boat is in water.</i>

DEAN: <i>This is our captain.</i>
<i>We call him Captain Stabby.</i>

37:57.275 --> 38:00.319
<i>He's gonna... (LAUGHING) ...stab</i>
<i>the monkey out of the crow's nest.</i>

38:00.486 --> 38:03.364
<i>She's got a banana to try</i>
<i>to coax him down.</i>

<i>-Our crew member over there has a blowgun.</i>
-(WOMAN LAUGHING)

38:06.117 --> 38:09.120
The cannon ties in because when the...
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

38:10.204 --> 38:11.706
...goes off there,
that's their last-ditch effort

38:11.789 --> 38:13.332
<i>to scare him out of the crow's nest.</i>

38:13.624 --> 38:16.294
MATTHEW: <i>There's a treasure map</i>
<i>out of tortillas.</i>

38:16.460 --> 38:20.464
VIVIAN: <i>All the faces, the arms and legs</i>
<i>are modeling chocolate.</i>

38:20.589 --> 38:26.345
<i>And then I dressed them up using</i>
<i>cabbages, and kale, and bok choy.</i>

38:26.679 --> 38:28.431
MATTHEW: <i>Our ship is carbalicious.</i>

38:28.514 --> 38:31.684
<i>It's baguettes, French bread,</i>
<i>flatbread, tortillas.</i>

38:31.892 --> 38:34.895
DEAN: <i>So the body of the vulture</i>
<i>is a giant taro root,</i>

38:35.354 --> 38:36.772
also known as malanga root.

38:36.939 --> 38:39.775
<i>The white part in between</i>
<i>is from a Korean radish.</i>

38:39.859 --> 38:41.736
<i>And the neck is a butternut squash.</i>

38:42.153 --> 38:45.156
One of the most memorable antics
from this movie is the scene

38:45.489 --> 38:48.534
<i>when the chimp is up there</i>
<i>and the pirates are trying to lure him in.</i>

38:48.617 --> 38:52.288
<i>You've actually pulled from the storyline</i>
<i>of </i>Pirates of the Caribbean.

38:52.413 --> 38:54.332
I just love that you incorporated
a little bit of humor.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.752
<i>This one over here is ready to poke him</i>
<i>with his glitter sword.</i>

38:57.918 --> 39:00.338
-I mean, a glitter sword.
-(ALL LAUGH)

39:00.421 --> 39:02.673
There's a ton of techniques in this piece.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.301
<i>The characters, the sculpting details</i>
<i>on the face,</i>

39:05.384 --> 39:08.971
their expression, the coloring.
The way that you placed

39:09.055 --> 39:10.806
the lettuce on each one of them.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.184
<i>You took your time</i>
<i>to place them correctly,</i>

39:13.476 --> 39:16.729
so the ruffles are facing the direction
that you want it to go.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.148
Vivian, in the beginning,
I was really worried.

39:19.231 --> 39:22.026
It took you a long time to create
the actual characters.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.362
But the final look, it's just stunning.

39:24.862 --> 39:29.784
One thing that I wasn't expecting to see
as part of the challenge is the ice.

39:29.950 --> 39:31.577
<i>I immediately see like the ship</i>

39:31.660 --> 39:35.039
is just going through the ocean
and the waves are just popping out.

39:35.122 --> 39:38.918
It's a great effect. I would probably
have tried to do it a little bit higher...

39:39.085 --> 39:40.169
-I agree.
-...so the waves would look

39:40.252 --> 39:41.545
a little bit more impressive.

39:41.712 --> 39:43.756
I did a little surprised over
on the other wave.

39:44.173 --> 39:47.843
-KEKE: Oh, my gosh. A squid up in there.
-So I took our challenge

39:47.927 --> 39:49.178
and incorporated it into our ice.

39:49.595 --> 39:52.431
AMIRAH: When I get closer here,
I find so many hidden gems

39:52.515 --> 39:55.476
<i>throughout this boat.</i>
<i>I'm seeing star anise.</i>

39:55.559 --> 39:57.186
<i>This looks like a pork rind</i>

39:57.269 --> 39:59.605
with some sort... what is this one,
please?

39:59.688 --> 40:00.689
VIVIAN: Oh.

40:01.107 --> 40:05.444
I grew up with it, so I've got all
these ideas for this

40:05.611 --> 40:08.322
-from just all my childhood. Growing up...
-You brought your culture into it.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.573
-VIVIAN: Yeah.
-I love that.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.659
I love that you pulled from what you know,
from what... who you are

40:11.742 --> 40:14.161
and your heritage and incorporate it
into this.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.789
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much, Monster Sculptors.

40:16.872 --> 40:19.083
Wishing you the best of luck.
And we'll see you soon.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.584
-Thank you.
-BOTH: Thank you.

40:20.751 --> 40:23.546
Obviously, everybody did
such a fantastic job.

40:23.629 --> 40:26.841
The storytelling, and the characters,
and the curses,

40:26.924 --> 40:28.259
<i>they were just so many different things,</i>

40:28.342 --> 40:31.637
<i>the cannon, all the challenges,</i>
<i>incorporating it, all of it, and just...</i>

40:31.762 --> 40:35.599
-And each team took a different approach.
-(DEAN GRUNTS)

40:35.808 --> 40:37.768
-I'm nervous.
-Oh, man.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.521
I mean, they had to really change
the texture. You guys were...

40:40.604 --> 40:42.022
-BENNY: Yes.
-You know, you guys weren't holding back.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.525
You wanted to see color.
You wanted this transformation.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.152
(INHALES SHARPLY)

40:46.360 --> 40:47.778
-I think we know who it is.
-BENNY: Yes.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.196
Let's go.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.369

-DILL: Cool.

40:56.620 --> 40:57.830
Oh!

40:58.205 --> 41:00.666
-The classic Disney Castle.
-Awesome.

41:00.958 --> 41:04.795
We absolutely love your creations,
and we think Hector Barbossa

41:04.879 --> 41:11.010
would be honored to be rescued
by any of them. But only one can win.

MATTHEW: Thank you so much.

42:05.564 --> 42:09.944
Winning this competition means everything
because we've been calling ourselves

To adventure, matey,

42:56.907 --> 43:00.035
And, if there be time,
perhaps the Port Royal

43:00.452 --> 43:04.623
to procure some fresh ginger root,
and tomatoes, and garlic.

43:04.707 --> 43:08.210
Ooh, you can never have too much garlic.
I might as well make a list.

43:10.087 --> 43:11.171
Okay.
