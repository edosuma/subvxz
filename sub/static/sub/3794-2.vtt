02:09.345 --> 02:12.147
Just explain this to me:
Ugly guy walks into a bar,

02:12.182 --> 02:14.783
and hotass katherine heigl
wants to party with him?

02:14.817 --> 02:17.619
- She was drunk!
- She wasn't drunk yet, that's my point.

02:17.654 --> 02:19.788
She was sober and she drinks with him

02:19.822 --> 02:22.424
and then she goes home with him
even though when she was sober

02:22.458 --> 02:24.693
she could plainly see how ugly he was.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.795
Jamie was sober when she met you, wasn't she?

02:26.829 --> 02:28.530
I'm cute, drama. Ask anybody.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.966
Turtle, funny guys get girls
and she went home with him

02:31.000 --> 02:34.386
- 'cause seth rogen's funny.
- He hadn't said anything yet to show he was funny.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.188
He's so ugly she knew he had to be funny.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.957
- How would she know that?
- Because he was starring in the movie.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.644
If he wasn't funny, there's no way
someone that ugly could star in a movie.

02:42.679 --> 02:45.264
You know, in some alternate
universe that actually makes sense.

02:45.298 --> 02:47.733
- Not to me it doesn't.
- Why do you keep watching this movie

02:47.767 --> 02:50.702
- if it bugs you so much?
- His ugliness is oddly fascinating...

02:50.737 --> 02:52.638
especially in blu-ray. It pisses me off.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.239
It pisses you off? I'm the one

02:54.274 --> 02:56.608
who's so good-looking i
couldn't even get an audition.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.777
- Where do you want this?
- You can put it anywhere.

02:58.811 --> 03:02.130
- Hey, sloan.
- Wow, nice to have friends with flexible jobs, huh?

03:02.165 --> 03:04.483
- Hey.
- Hey, sloan, would you bang seth rogen?

03:04.517 --> 03:06.018
- Jesus.
- I think he's funny

03:06.052 --> 03:07.619
but i don't think i could go through with it.

03:07.654 --> 03:09.488
- I told ya!
- What about turtle?

03:09.522 --> 03:11.189
<i>- Guys!
- You think he's cute?</i>

03:11.224 --> 03:13.408
- Turtle, i think you're very cute.
- What?!

03:13.443 --> 03:16.011
- Thank you, sloan.
- You're welcome!

03:16.045 --> 03:20.415
All right, two sets of keys,
alarm code and garage opener.

03:20.433 --> 03:23.018
- Great.
- And amy left this for you.

03:23.052 --> 03:25.103
- A love note?
- Feels like a photo.

03:25.138 --> 03:28.357
- Ayup.
- How do you find these friends?

03:28.391 --> 03:31.260
I swear vince brings it out in people.

03:31.294 --> 03:34.429
- Tell her this was very thoughtful.
- Very.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.098
- Do you need a hand there?
- Nope.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.367
<i>Will you get that?</i>

03:38.401 --> 03:40.736
Yeah.

03:40.770 --> 03:44.323
Ahem. Hello, eric murphy's phone.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.759
Hello? Hello?

03:47.794 --> 03:49.461
- What happened?
- They hung up.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.112
Oh, probably a wrong number.

03:51.130 --> 03:53.415
Or just mayb one of your randoms.

03:53.449 --> 03:55.968
I gotta go back to work.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.669
See you later.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.838
Hey, vince, good luck
with the premiere tonight.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.606
- Thank you.
- Not that you need it.

04:01.641 --> 04:04.476
- I heard the reviews have been amazing.
- So far so good.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.545
Hey, sloan, you want to come tonight?

04:06.579 --> 04:09.915
- Jeez, give less notice.
- Seriously, e.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.467
- Was i talking to you idiots?
- Walk with me.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.853
Mind your business.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.291
- Guys!
- So what's up? You don't want to go?

04:20.326 --> 04:22.427
I just don't think we
should be going on dates.

04:22.462 --> 04:25.097
Don't think of it as a date. It'd
be nice just to have you there.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.699
- So we'll go as friends?
- Yeah, we can go as buddies.

04:27.734 --> 04:30.736
All right, i just bought a new
dress. I had nowhere to wear it.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.255
I'll see you there, buddy.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.767
<i>- Lloyd?
- Yes, andrew?</i>

04:45.802 --> 04:47.803
<i>- Are you okay?
- I've eaten nothing</i>

04:47.837 --> 04:49.688
but one grape an hour for the last two days.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.707
I will be a stealth and
sleek agent in no time.

04:51.741 --> 04:54.976
- How's the weight loss coming?
- I've lost 16oz.

04:55.010 --> 04:57.346
- Hang in there.
- Mr. Klein.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.648
- What's the good word?
- You're gonna kill lloyd

04:59.682 --> 05:02.067
- and i have a proposition for you.
- A wife swap tonight.

05:02.118 --> 05:04.286
- How's the missus looking these days?
- She's okay

05:04.320 --> 05:06.288
but i'm talking about lizzie grant.

05:06.322 --> 05:08.240
The junior agent with the great ass.

05:08.291 --> 05:11.743
- She offering it up?
- No, but she has two big u.t.a. Show runners

05:11.794 --> 05:13.995
who are looking for a new agency.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.981
Andrew, you're tv. I'm everything else.

05:16.015 --> 05:19.634
Just sit down so they know they have the
support of the guy with the "s" on his chest.

05:19.669 --> 05:21.703
<i>- Five minutes, okay?
- Done.</i>

05:21.721 --> 05:24.756
Let's talk about more important
things... are you pumped for tonight?

05:24.807 --> 05:27.642
This is not the new "90210"
premiere. This is scorsese.

05:27.677 --> 05:29.644
I am pumped indeed! Oh, a little head's up,

05:29.679 --> 05:31.480
the wife's probably not going to come.

05:31.514 --> 05:34.733
What? Why not? This is a couple's
thing. My wife is very excited.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.753
- As was i.
- What's really going on with you?

05:37.787 --> 05:41.273
- What if your wife doesn't like marlow?
- Of course she will!

05:41.324 --> 05:44.025
No, marlow's a little intimidated
by this side of the hill.

05:44.059 --> 05:46.161
She's still a valley girl at heart.

05:46.195 --> 05:48.113
Andrew, my man, lighten up.

05:48.164 --> 05:49.948
My wife will love her, trust me.

05:49.999 --> 05:52.834
And when we're together after this,
we don't have to speak to them,

05:52.869 --> 05:55.287
and we get to keep all our money.

05:55.338 --> 05:56.421
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.523
Okay, all right, i'll talk to her.

06:00.576 --> 06:03.412
- You're just dumb dumb dumb.
- Would you leave me alone?

06:03.446 --> 06:05.847
The second you heard the "f"
word come out of her mouth

06:05.882 --> 06:08.350
- you should have told her to take a hike.
- I want her there.

06:08.384 --> 06:10.218
- As your friend?
- Yes.

06:10.253 --> 06:12.287
- Bull-shit. - I'm
with these guys.

06:12.321 --> 06:15.056
- Why are you torturing yourself?
- I'm not torturing myself.

06:15.091 --> 06:18.160
I like being friends with
her and i like being single.

06:18.194 --> 06:20.429
Tonight you won't. Not now that you've got

06:20.463 --> 06:22.297
a non-fucking friend on your arm.

06:22.331 --> 06:25.467
- At least i've got someone on my arm.
- Please, the day's still young.

06:25.501 --> 06:27.369
Chase! Get one shot over here?

06:29.939 --> 06:31.690
Hey, boys, good to see you.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.992
- I will grab your suits.
- Thanks, kelly.

06:34.043 --> 06:36.428
Looking good, kel, looking real good!

06:36.462 --> 06:38.396
What?

06:38.431 --> 06:41.383
- You're creepy.
- Are you kidding? She loves me.

06:41.417 --> 06:44.953
You should have seen her eyes bulge
when the tailor was measuring my inseam.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.088
- Why don't you invite her?
- Maybe.

06:47.123 --> 06:49.291
Her or your hand... tough decision.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.893
The tough part is i love
being solo at premieres.

06:51.928 --> 06:54.629
E, ditch the buddy. We'll
scour for pussy together,

06:54.664 --> 06:56.531
bring 'em back to your place.

06:56.566 --> 06:58.633
Drama, i moved into this house so you and i

06:58.668 --> 07:01.269
never have to bring girls
back to the same place again.

07:01.304 --> 07:03.338
- Your loss.
- Who would've thought

07:03.372 --> 07:05.974
i'd be the only one
guaranteed to have sex tonight?

07:06.008 --> 07:08.343
I mean, already planned
and with a name attached.

07:08.377 --> 07:11.012
<i>- I'm taking sara.
- Oh, from saturday?</i>

07:11.047 --> 07:12.981
Uh, no, sorry, lisa from friday.

07:13.015 --> 07:14.649
- Since when?
- Since just now.

07:15.985 --> 07:18.286
I guess you really are
the seventh wheel, drama.

07:18.321 --> 07:20.355
No, forget that.

07:20.389 --> 07:24.392
Hey, kelly, you want to go to my
baby brother's premiere tonight?

07:24.427 --> 07:27.929
- Scorsese's "gatsby."
- Uh, yeah.

07:27.964 --> 07:30.098
<i>- Yeah, okay.
- Great.</i>

07:30.132 --> 07:31.366
<i>- Great.
- All right.</i>

07:31.400 --> 07:32.417
All right.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.319
She loves me.

07:34.353 --> 07:36.521
I'd better get some rubbers.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.624
Seriously, ari, why are you pushing
me to have a date with this woman?

07:39.659 --> 07:41.593
It's not a date. It's a manl-pedi.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.496
I planned a very lovely
welcome-to-the-agency dinner for them

07:44.530 --> 07:46.381
when you hired andrew and she canceled.

07:46.415 --> 07:49.868
Twice. Maybe mrs. Klein doesn't
want to be friends with me.

07:49.902 --> 07:53.488
- Andrew thinks that she's intimidated by you.
- Why would she be?

07:53.523 --> 07:56.057
Because she's very insecure.
And, honey, look at you.

07:56.092 --> 07:58.226
I mean, you make confident people insecure.

07:58.261 --> 08:02.113
- That is so sad.
- I know it's sad, but have pity on the poor woman.

08:02.148 --> 08:05.016
- Why is this so important to you?
- Because...

08:05.051 --> 08:08.369
andrew is on his way to becoming
one of my biggest earners

08:08.387 --> 08:11.540
and i like him. Wouldn't you like to
have a nice couple we can hang with?

08:11.574 --> 08:13.275
We hang with plenty of nice couples.

08:13.309 --> 08:15.844
We hang with plenty of your
friends and their husbands.

08:15.878 --> 08:17.646
- You don't like them?
- I hate them.

08:17.680 --> 08:21.549
- Maybe you're the problem, ari.
- Why do i have to fight with you on this?

08:21.567 --> 08:25.136
- Having a couple i enjoy will benefit both you and me.
- Really? How so?

08:25.171 --> 08:28.840
Imagine i could spend
the proper amount of time

08:28.874 --> 08:31.176
with you in the most focused

08:31.210 --> 08:33.477
and best mood possible without us pretending

08:33.511 --> 08:35.679
we have so much to say to each other.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.417
- All right, fine.
- Fine you'll do it?

08:39.452 --> 08:41.269
- You'll call her?
- Yes, i will call her.

08:41.304 --> 08:44.506
That's so great, baby.
I gotta go back to work.

08:44.540 --> 08:47.142
- Need some cash.
- I am not a hooker.

08:47.176 --> 08:49.010
Oh, but what a good one you would be.

08:49.045 --> 08:50.946
I love you.

08:53.182 --> 08:55.517
Fun lunch, darling.

08:55.551 --> 08:58.620
- You have less to eat.
- I just moved in.

08:58.654 --> 09:00.755
I've been with you tools all day long.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.392
Us tools will be out of your way
now that my work here is done.

09:04.427 --> 09:07.095
- Did you really need to use my bathroom?
- I really did.

09:07.129 --> 09:10.031
- I haven't even used it yet.
- Don't be such a priss.

09:10.066 --> 09:13.268
- Hello!
- Whoa, i like your neighbors.

09:13.302 --> 09:15.320
- Hey, ashley.
- That's no neighbor.

09:15.371 --> 09:18.039
That's that girl from that
party on beechwood last week...

09:18.074 --> 09:20.075
blue dress, 34b rack.

09:20.109 --> 09:22.294
- How do you know that?
- Good eyes.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.829
- Don't stare, johnny.
- So what's happening?

09:24.864 --> 09:28.116
- I told you i was bringing you a housewarming gift.
- That's right... 3:00.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.001
- Oh, i can come back.
- Oh no no no.

09:30.052 --> 09:33.171
Oh, okay. Hi guys.

09:33.222 --> 09:34.389
<i>- Hi there.
- Hello.</i>

09:34.423 --> 09:35.874
Guys, this is ashley.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.876
Hi.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.579
Um, so here. It's just a plant.

09:41.614 --> 09:45.367
Oh, that's... that's great. Thanks.

09:45.401 --> 09:47.802
Well, you obviously have your friends here,

09:47.837 --> 09:50.038
- so i'll get out of your way.
- No no, please, hang out.

09:50.072 --> 09:52.073
<i>No, i gotta get back to work anyway, really.</i>

09:52.108 --> 09:55.944
But, listen, any chance that you came across
that bracelet while you were unpacking?

09:55.978 --> 09:58.146
You know what? I looked
for it, i couldn't find it.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.814
- I'm sorry.
- Damn.

09:59.849 --> 10:02.817
Will you guys please look at your
house? It's really important to me.

10:02.835 --> 10:04.586
<i>- We will search high and low.
- Thanks.</i>

10:06.255 --> 10:08.957
Um, so, eric, do you have plans tonight?

10:08.991 --> 10:11.976
Uh, yeah, it's actually
vince's big premiere tonight.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.629
Oh, right right! That should be great.

10:14.663 --> 10:17.065
- It should be.
- Yeah.

10:18.467 --> 10:20.452
Okay...

10:20.486 --> 10:22.220
well, look, you know, i'll call you.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.889
<i>I'll call you later and
if your bracelet turns up,</i>

10:24.924 --> 10:26.691
- i'll let you know, okay?
- Oh, okay.

10:26.726 --> 10:28.326
Okay, well, bye.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.779
- Okay.
- See you later.

10:30.813 --> 10:32.447
- See you.
- Ahem.

10:32.481 --> 10:34.816
<i>- Bye. -
Bye-bye!</i>

10:34.850 --> 10:37.152
- See you.
- Bye.

10:37.186 --> 10:40.221
God, e, are you awkward!

10:40.256 --> 10:43.258
I totally forgot she was coming.

10:43.292 --> 10:46.828
Never in my life did i think i'd ever see you
kick a little cutie out the door like that.

10:46.862 --> 10:49.164
- I didn't kick her out.
- She was begging for a ticket.

10:49.198 --> 10:51.383
And a ride on the tiny e express.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.152
- Why didn't you give her a ticket?
- Do we even have any left?

10:54.186 --> 10:56.137
We got plenty. You want
me to grab her? She's cute.

10:56.172 --> 10:57.872
- No, i don't want her there.
- Why not?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.508
- Because i don't want her to get the wrong ideas.
- What ideas?

11:00.543 --> 11:02.644
Like that you love sloan?

11:02.678 --> 11:05.613
No, ideas like i don't want her
to be my girlfriend, which i don't!

11:05.648 --> 11:07.916
Because i don't want
anybody to be my girlfriend.

11:07.950 --> 11:10.351
<i>- You really like being single?
- Yes!</i>

11:10.386 --> 11:13.188
Mr. Relationship's going
to stick to that statement?

11:13.222 --> 11:16.324
Aw, come on. For the first time in his
life he's enjoying playing the field.

11:16.358 --> 11:18.392
- He's entitled.
- He is, and if he were normal

11:18.411 --> 11:20.395
i'd buy it, but he's not, so i don't.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.531
Yeah, me either. Sloan tells him
she wants to get back together

11:23.565 --> 11:25.266
et and the field is shut down!

11:25.301 --> 11:27.135
She won't, so i guess you'll never know.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.871
Yeah, but if she did, would
you want to get back together?

11:29.905 --> 11:32.006
She just wants to be friends,
so what's the difference?

11:32.041 --> 11:34.809
Why did she push you to get your own
place if she just wants to be friends?

11:34.844 --> 11:37.796
- Because she's thoughtful.
- I think she's sending mixed signals.

11:37.847 --> 11:40.865
Which isn't good for a fragile
sensitive mind like e's.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.301
Yeah, and she did try and
get him drunk the other night.

11:43.352 --> 11:45.653
So what? What's the big
deal? Nothing happened.

11:45.688 --> 11:49.057
- Maybe she wanted it to.
- She's testing you, e.

11:49.091 --> 11:51.426
And you're failing miserably.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.229
- Don't you guys have to get ready?
- Takes me two minutes.

11:54.263 --> 11:55.880
All right, all right, come on.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.183
- Let's go.
- All right, i'll see you guys later.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.418
- Peace.
- Look, if you're really done with that,

12:00.453 --> 12:01.936
do you mind if i gobble it up?

12:01.954 --> 12:03.438
A) you're disgusting.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.874
B) you're old enough to be her grandfather.

12:05.908 --> 12:08.610
- Great grandfather.
- I'll see you guys later.

12:09.879 --> 12:12.664
Wake up, toto. You're not in kansas anymore.

12:12.715 --> 12:15.433
- Jesus, ari, you startled me.
- You look half dead.

12:15.468 --> 12:18.219
- I'm at lunch.
- Starving yourself

12:18.254 --> 12:20.638
isn't going to help you
make it to the finish line.

12:24.059 --> 12:28.496
<i>I'm only willing to power walk
and who has the time? 15 lbs?</i>

12:30.432 --> 12:33.718
Ari gold's office. Oh, mrs. Gold, hi.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.621
I'm okay. Weak, but surviving.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.957
- Just a second.
- How'd it go, baby?

12:38.991 --> 12:41.025
<i>- I hate that bitch.
- What?</i>

12:41.060 --> 12:44.112
She's abrasive, obnoxious. She is nasty.

12:44.146 --> 12:47.015
Andrew klein's ready and
heading to the conference room.

12:47.049 --> 12:50.752
- I can't believe it.
- Well, don't... because it's a joke!

12:50.786 --> 12:52.453
<i>What?</i>

12:52.488 --> 12:55.390
- We love each other, ari.
- Say hi. That's marlow.

12:55.424 --> 12:58.326
<i>- Oh, we got the same color nails.
- I love it!</i>

12:58.360 --> 13:01.329
- We're going to have such a good time tonight.
- I can't wait.

13:01.347 --> 13:04.232
Listen, make sure that you
feisty gals start boozing early.

13:04.266 --> 13:06.601
- We're way ahead of you on that.
- Yeah!

13:06.635 --> 13:08.453
<i>Ready, here we go. Here we go.</i>

13:09.638 --> 13:11.272
- Mmm.
- It's your lucky day.

13:11.307 --> 13:13.892
<i>- How so?
- I'm only gonna makw y.</i>

13:17.012 --> 13:19.347
<i>Thanks, truly, thank you. He's getting there.</i>

13:19.381 --> 13:21.149
Gentlemen, trust me when i say you don't want

13:21.183 --> 13:23.952
<i>to be sitting anywhere other than
where you're sitting right now.</i>

13:23.986 --> 13:25.753
You guys are the best in
the business at what you do.

13:25.788 --> 13:27.722
We're the best in the business at what we do.

13:27.756 --> 13:30.024
Of course ari and i will
be there 200% of the time,

13:30.059 --> 13:33.127
but there's little doubt that lizzie
can handle everything you need.

13:33.162 --> 13:35.129
<i>Ari, you got anything else you want to add?</i>

13:35.164 --> 13:37.549
Just that your script is
fantastic, you are stars

13:37.583 --> 13:40.168
<i>and we would love for you
to be a part of this agency.</i>

13:40.202 --> 13:43.838
- Okay.
- That's a quick sell if i ever heard one.

13:43.872 --> 13:46.991
Listen, you'll have to excuse my
abruptness, but this is a win-win situation,

13:47.026 --> 13:51.329
- and i don't want to waste your time with small talk.
- That's what i'm here for.

13:51.363 --> 13:53.531
We enjoyed it. Especially
everything lizzie said.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.067
Ahh, she's a smart one, this girl.

13:56.101 --> 14:00.822
Would you gentlemen be interested in
tickets to scorsese's "gatsby" tonight?

14:00.856 --> 14:05.026
I can introduce you to vinnie chase for when
you want to make that jump into features.

14:05.060 --> 14:06.995
- Yeah.
- That'd be great.

14:07.029 --> 14:10.848
All right, yeah. 'Cause there's nothing
like celebrating a client's success

14:10.883 --> 14:14.636
with a good friend like
andrew and our beautiful wives.

14:16.305 --> 14:18.739
So what do you say we continue
this conversation tonight?

14:18.757 --> 14:20.742
- Yeah, we'd love to.
- Yeah.

14:20.776 --> 14:23.711
Okay, great. You guys are
going to have a fantastic time.

14:23.746 --> 14:26.614
- I'll just show them out.
- Cool, great, perfect.

14:28.684 --> 14:30.618
- What?
- Are you out of your mind?

14:30.653 --> 14:33.421
- What do you mean?
- Please tell me you're not fucking her.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.391
What?! Ari, what... no!

14:36.425 --> 14:38.526
My wife is out right now
buttering up your wife

14:38.560 --> 14:40.862
- so we can live happily ever after.
- Why?

14:40.896 --> 14:43.064
- Because i asked her to!
- You shouldn't have done that.

14:43.098 --> 14:46.034
Andrew, you have been given a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

14:46.068 --> 14:48.569
to take your lifestyle and
your career to the next level.

14:48.604 --> 14:52.206
You throw it away on some 22-year-old,
you're gonna be left with nothing but herpes.

14:52.241 --> 14:55.109
- She's 26.
- Oh, jesus christ! Get it together... quickly.

14:57.579 --> 14:59.647
20 lbs, lloyd!

15:05.921 --> 15:09.257
- Would you leave me alone? Tell them to leave me alone!
- Leave him alone, drama!

15:09.291 --> 15:11.342
I'm just saying this is
your coming-out party.

15:11.393 --> 15:13.978
This is the first time you're
really gonna be photographed together

15:14.013 --> 15:18.182
- and you're wearing sneakers!
- I think he looks cool and handsome.

15:18.233 --> 15:21.635
I think he looks bloated! I
begged him to see my colonic guy.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.805
Unlike you, i don't like
guys sticking stuff up my ass.

15:24.823 --> 15:26.941
Oh, this is gonna be a great night!

15:26.975 --> 15:29.861
<i>- Totally.
- I'm sorry, but, e, if i knew you didn't have a date,</i>

15:29.895 --> 15:32.413
i could have totally found a friend for you.

15:32.448 --> 15:36.650
Or you could have went with him. I'm sure you
would've enjoyed it more than your current date.

15:36.669 --> 15:40.654
- I can be both their dates.
- Sorry, kel, johnny don't roll like that.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.990
I say the more the merrier.

15:45.127 --> 15:47.962
Yeah, thanks anyway, kel.
I'm meeting somebody there.

15:47.996 --> 15:50.631
<i>- A friend.
- Awww, e!</i>

15:50.665 --> 15:53.768
- He's not gay, is he?
- Uh, no.

15:53.802 --> 15:56.137
All right, here we are. Let's do this!

15:56.171 --> 15:58.189
Yeah, baby!

16:04.763 --> 16:07.065
<i>¶ everybody gonna dance tonight ¶</i>

16:07.099 --> 16:09.767
<i>¶ everybody gonna feel all right ¶</i>

16:09.802 --> 16:13.654
<i>¶ everybody gonna find some love tonight ¶</i>

16:15.924 --> 16:18.192
<i>¶ everybody gonna dance around ¶</i>

16:18.227 --> 16:21.429
<i>- ¶ everybody gonna hit the ground... ¶
- Vince, vince!</i>

16:21.463 --> 16:23.564
Can we ask you some questions?

16:25.034 --> 16:27.035
Yo yo yo! Johnny chase!

16:27.069 --> 16:29.987
Johnny, are you alone tonight, johnny?

16:30.022 --> 16:33.958
Well, if having basically a
world-class fashion model on your arm

16:33.992 --> 16:36.094
is considered being alone, then yeah.

16:36.128 --> 16:39.397
- What's your name?
- Kelly. What's yours?

16:40.432 --> 16:42.133
All right, come on. Over here.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.569
I'll meet you inside. I
just want to find the kleins.

16:44.603 --> 16:47.755
You're being a little obsessive, baby.
You might want to tone it down a bit.

16:47.790 --> 16:49.957
Okay, freak. I thought you
wanted us to be friends.

16:49.992 --> 16:51.959
Friends, not siamese ass-buddies.

16:51.994 --> 16:55.430
Look, she already flaked on you once.
I just don't want you to get hurt.

16:55.464 --> 16:58.633
Actually marlow told me that it was
andrew that insisted on canceling

16:58.667 --> 17:01.669
<i>so maybe you should be careful.
Sweetie, i'll meet you inside.</i>

17:01.703 --> 17:03.371
Okay, all right.

17:03.405 --> 17:05.973
I can't wait to see it. I am so excited.

17:06.008 --> 17:08.992
Turtle here slipped me some
dailies and they were unbelievable.

17:09.027 --> 17:11.529
- Jamie!
- I'm just kidding.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.964
- I'm just kidding, marty.
- Who's turtle?

17:13.999 --> 17:17.201
- Uh, he's my boyfriend.
- How you doing?

17:17.236 --> 17:20.505
- Just turtle?
- Yeah, like madonna.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.624
I let her call me sal, but only her.

17:23.659 --> 17:25.492
That's sweet.

17:38.407 --> 17:40.441
thank you, gordon. Thank you so much.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.543
Thanks for coming, guys. Enjoy the movie.

17:45.964 --> 17:47.331
- Wow.
- Hello.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.116
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.885
- You look great.
- Thank you.

17:50.919 --> 17:53.621
- We still get to sit next to each other?
- I suppose.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.723
Can we do that? Thank you very much.

17:55.757 --> 17:58.960
I am so proud of this movie, but
mostly just thankful to marty.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.828
- Vinnie!
- Oh, look, it's my agent!

18:00.863 --> 18:03.097
Hey, i'll talk to you later, man. All right.

18:03.131 --> 18:05.032
- Thanks, man.
- Nice of you to join us.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.668
I am here and i am all about you.

18:07.703 --> 18:09.604
So you ready?

18:09.638 --> 18:11.139
- I am.
- Okay, then,

18:11.173 --> 18:13.908
let's go reintroduce you to the world.

18:31.126 --> 18:33.561
<i>- Genius genius genius.
- Yes.</i>

18:33.595 --> 18:35.363
And i'm not ashamed to admit it:

18:35.397 --> 18:37.598
I'm proud to have a baby
brother to look up to.

18:37.633 --> 18:40.434
- Aw, thank you, johnny.
- I cannot walk three feet in this place

18:40.469 --> 18:44.005
without being accosted by someone who
wants a piece of the new vinnie chase!

18:44.039 --> 18:46.524
You guys, thanks for coming.

18:46.558 --> 18:49.861
<i>- It means a lot to me, really.
- Wouldn't miss it for the world, vin.</i>

18:49.895 --> 18:51.996
Excuse me, everybody.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.000
- It means a lot that you're here too.
- Oh, thank you.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.469
- Can i get anyone another drink?
- Good, i'm good.

18:58.503 --> 19:01.239
I'm gonna come with you. Are
you sure you don't want anything?

19:01.273 --> 19:03.341
- Naw, we're good, thanks.
- No, thank you.

19:03.375 --> 19:06.611
- They're really cute together.
- Baby, they're not together.

19:06.645 --> 19:09.897
They are so. It doesn't matter what
they say, they are fully in love.

19:09.932 --> 19:12.934
- Kinda like how we started?
- We were in lust.

19:12.968 --> 19:16.203
- I'll take it.
- She said "were," past tense.

19:16.221 --> 19:19.774
<i>We were in lust. We are in love.</i>

19:19.808 --> 19:22.476
- Awwww.
- What a country.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.581
Thank you.

19:26.615 --> 19:28.149
<i>- Hello.
- What can i get for you?</i>

19:28.183 --> 19:30.884
I would like a glass of
merlot and he will have...

19:30.903 --> 19:33.487
a belvedere on the rocks with two limes.

19:33.522 --> 19:36.190
- You think you know me so well, huh?
- Don't i?

19:36.225 --> 19:37.992
Eric?

19:38.026 --> 19:40.311
Ashley! Hey, hi.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.113
Hi! So i made it after all.

19:42.147 --> 19:44.815
Yeah, i see that. This is sloan.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.101
Hi.

19:47.135 --> 19:48.469
Yeah, um...

19:48.503 --> 19:50.538
lucky me had a friend at c.a.a.

19:50.572 --> 19:52.707
Who had an extra ticket
so that's why i'm here.

19:52.741 --> 19:54.508
- That's great, that's great.
- Yeah.

19:54.543 --> 19:58.012
E, i'm gonna go back to the table.

19:58.046 --> 20:00.765
- Okay.
- Okay. See you.

20:03.752 --> 20:06.587
- "E"?
- Uh, yeah, it's what my friends call me.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.306
- So she's a friend?
- Yeah.

20:08.340 --> 20:12.610
- Are you here together?
- Yes, as friends.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.061
Oh.

20:14.095 --> 20:17.398
And technically i'm still working.

20:17.432 --> 20:20.952
- L-i understand. - So i should
probably get back to vince.

20:20.986 --> 20:23.937
- Oh, okay
- but i'll call you l.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.656
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:25.707 --> 20:27.775
- I'll see ya.
- I'll see ya.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.611
There was no way that i was giving up my seat

20:30.646 --> 20:33.547
for this woman's "manicure emergency."

20:33.582 --> 20:36.050
And she was spewing venom and then marlow...

20:36.084 --> 20:39.987
i marched right over, i dump her purse
out and i smashed her gucci sunglasses.

20:40.022 --> 20:42.373
Hilarious. I wouldn't want
to be on your bad side.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.809
<i>Oh no, the entire salon erupts in applause.</i>

20:44.843 --> 20:47.378
- This woman was such a nightmare.
- Horrible!

20:47.412 --> 20:49.563
I'm glad you guys had fun.

20:49.598 --> 20:52.233
Would you guys excuse me for a second?

20:54.670 --> 20:56.837
What is with him? Such a wet rag!

20:56.872 --> 20:59.974
Oh, ari! How would you
feel about the four of us,

21:00.008 --> 21:01.942
cabo for new year's eve?

21:01.977 --> 21:05.880
Fuck new year's eve. It's overrated,
overpriced. I'm gonna be right back.

21:05.914 --> 21:08.549
- Well, they suck.
Mm-hmm. - They do.

21:15.657 --> 21:17.658
- You look lost.
- Hey, where is everybody?

21:17.676 --> 21:19.827
- Off with their girls.
- Ahh.

21:19.845 --> 21:22.763
- Are you all right?
- I've been better.

21:22.798 --> 21:25.466
- Not going well with sloan?
- I don't even know where she is.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.468
- And ashley's here.
- Ashley?

21:27.502 --> 21:30.271
- Yeah, she showed up.
- Wow, she likes you.

21:30.305 --> 21:33.691
- Seems like it.
- But you still love sloan?

21:33.725 --> 21:35.976
I'm a mess.

21:36.010 --> 21:38.729
- Tell her.
- I don't know where she is.

21:38.780 --> 21:41.298
I do.

21:51.693 --> 21:53.360
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

21:53.378 --> 21:55.362
E, this is gregg; gregg, e.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.464
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:56.498 --> 21:58.582
You mind if i steal her for a minute?

21:58.633 --> 22:01.635
- Do you mind?
- I will be right back.

22:03.388 --> 22:06.040
- Who's that jerkoff?
- That's my cousin.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.892
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:07.926 --> 22:09.477
Oh, sorry.

22:09.511 --> 22:13.564
So who was the child with the bad attitude?

22:13.598 --> 22:16.350
- It's nobody.
- Hoold is she?

22:16.384 --> 22:18.853
- She's 24. I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.

22:18.887 --> 22:21.405
- No, that was rude.
- It was rude.

22:23.225 --> 22:26.177
Sloan, look, i didn't want you
to come here tonight as my friend.

22:26.211 --> 22:28.729
- I miss you.
- Oh, eric, don't.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.031
I know i screwed up. I
was a shitty boyfriend.

22:31.065 --> 22:34.401
You used me as storage. I
mean, you moved in for a week

22:34.419 --> 22:36.804
- and then left.
- I know that was all my fault.

22:36.838 --> 22:40.941
But things are different now. I finally moved
into a place... a place that you found for me.

22:40.976 --> 22:44.712
Eric, you moved in this morning.
I can't just jump back in.

22:44.746 --> 22:48.349
But i don't know if i can
be just friends with you.

22:48.383 --> 22:50.684
Well, then for now...

22:50.719 --> 22:52.970
let's not be.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.170
- What are you doing?
- Ari.

23:09.204 --> 23:11.872
- Look, i'm sorry.
- How long has this been going on?

23:11.907 --> 23:14.408
I don't know, it wasn't then
it was. It just happened.

23:14.442 --> 23:15.993
- Jesus.
- Don't judge me.

23:16.044 --> 23:20.014
<i>Don't judge you? I gave you everything
and this is how you repay me?</i>

23:20.048 --> 23:23.167
- This is not about you.
- In so many fucking ways it is.

23:23.218 --> 23:26.954
I know you didn't have the temptation at
your last job like i put in front of you,

23:26.972 --> 23:29.507
but at the end of the day,
she's just another young girl

23:29.558 --> 23:32.143
who's trying to make a name for
herself and you're just another

23:32.177 --> 23:35.295
<i>old fuck who's going to have to
take a pill to keep up with her.</i>

23:35.313 --> 23:38.265
- It has to end!
- What is wrong with you two?

23:38.299 --> 23:41.635
I thought the whole purpose of
this was to spend time together.

23:41.653 --> 23:44.939
- So let's get your asses out on the dance floor!
- Let's go!

23:44.973 --> 23:46.574
Come on!

23:46.608 --> 23:49.660
You guys see what i'm saying, right?

23:49.694 --> 23:52.997
Yes, we can all see that
you're obsessed with seth rogen.

23:53.031 --> 23:55.649
<i>- Seriously.
- I just want answers.</i>

23:55.667 --> 23:57.818
- Would you bang him?
- I said no!

23:57.836 --> 24:01.705
- Huh-uh. - Kelly, why
aren't you answering?

24:02.757 --> 24:04.542
'Cause i kinda did bang seth rogen.

24:04.576 --> 24:06.760

24:12.017 --> 24:14.602
- Pick it up!
- Give the guy a minute to be sad.

24:14.636 --> 24:17.188
- He had the whole ride over here.
- Answer it.

24:17.222 --> 24:19.023
You might want to save her for later.

24:21.676 --> 24:24.177
<i>- Hello.
- Eric, hi.</i>

24:24.196 --> 24:25.980
<i>I've been feeling awful.</i>

24:26.014 --> 24:28.566
I'm sorry i just ambushed you at the party

24:28.617 --> 24:31.986
and was rude. Just, i was nervous and drunk

24:32.020 --> 24:35.039
<i>- and, you know, it's no excuse.
- That's okay.</i>

24:35.073 --> 24:37.791
Mmm, look what i found!

24:37.826 --> 24:40.211
<i>- You forgive me?
- Yeah.</i>

24:40.245 --> 24:42.746
<i>- Good.
- And i just found your bracelet.</i>

24:42.781 --> 24:45.049
Oh my god, are you serious?

24:46.367 --> 24:49.420
You want to bring it over?

24:49.471 --> 24:51.872
Yeah, okay.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.807
Well, i'll see you soon.

24:59.014 --> 25:01.214
I'm gonna bring it to her.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.050
- Good.
- Way to bounce back.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.818
Very impressive.

25:04.853 --> 25:07.154
You think it'd be weird
if i thought about sloan?

25:07.188 --> 25:08.772
- Yes.
- Hell yeah.

25:08.823 --> 25:10.491

- Do what you gotta do.

25:10.525 --> 25:14.227
- Yes!
- Naww! I think about her all the time when i'm doing it.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.448
- Not with me you won't!
- No, unfortunately,

25:17.499 --> 25:19.533
i'll be thinking about you and "superbad."

25:19.567 --> 25:21.568
Get over it. I was really drunk.

25:21.586 --> 25:24.088
