WEBVTT

00:02.020 --> 00:05.000
- <i>Previously on</i> Tyrant...
- Ahmed, Ahmed.

00:05.030 --> 00:06.030
I'm bleeding.

00:06.070 --> 00:08.400
...but we will
push them back.

00:08.430 --> 00:09.290
AHMED: Nusrat.

00:09.330 --> 00:12.470
Your wife is fine.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.560
The baby didn't make it.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.710
I'm asking you
as an Al Fayeed

00:16.740 --> 00:18.710
for the money that
my grandfather left to me.

00:18.740 --> 00:22.000
I will arrange to transfer money
to you from a Swiss account.

00:22.030 --> 00:22.950
Ten million.

00:22.980 --> 00:26.020
Then you go, you leave, Sam,
and don't come back again.

00:26.050 --> 00:28.180
I have a friend, Halima.

00:28.220 --> 00:32.250
She says that there's a growing
insurgency called the Red Hand.

00:32.290 --> 00:34.860
- Why are you telling me this?
- They need money.

00:34.890 --> 00:38.460
You have your bombing targets?
You need to act now.

00:38.490 --> 00:41.030
- Do you want to give us our targets?
- The outskirts of the city.

00:41.070 --> 00:42.760
Somewhere where
you're sure no one is.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.130
- Genius.
- I don't care if we don't kill

00:45.170 --> 00:46.630
a single member
of the Caliphate; I do not want

00:46.660 --> 00:48.990
reports of civilian deaths.
Do you understand?

00:51.210 --> 00:53.240
SAMIRA:
<i>Bassam! Stop!</i>

00:54.780 --> 00:56.210
I warned you,
I'll kill her.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.280
(grunts)

00:57.320 --> 00:59.100
Oh, my... my God.

00:59.140 --> 01:00.700
Oh, my God.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.200
Good morning.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.070
Morning.

01:26.140 --> 01:27.110
Hi.

01:27.140 --> 01:28.540
Hi.

01:28.580 --> 01:31.310
Uh...

01:31.340 --> 01:35.150
So...

01:35.180 --> 01:37.380
we, um...

01:37.420 --> 01:39.380
Drank Chinese whiskey.

01:39.420 --> 01:40.380
Mmm.

01:40.420 --> 01:42.390
And then?

01:42.420 --> 01:43.820
Mmm.

01:43.860 --> 01:45.490
We didn't...?

01:45.520 --> 01:46.920
No.

01:49.530 --> 01:52.420
I don't really know
how to do this.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.300
That's okay.

01:56.630 --> 01:59.450
There's no rule book
for these kind of things.

02:01.410 --> 02:05.340
I'm gonna think the last time
I went on a date, I was 20.

02:05.380 --> 02:07.140
Oh, that's
what this was?

02:07.180 --> 02:09.150
No.

02:09.180 --> 02:11.080
I don't know.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.480
I think sleeping

02:12.520 --> 02:14.540
in all my clothes
on a first date

02:14.580 --> 02:16.320
sends the right message.

02:16.350 --> 02:18.720
Says I'm a good time,
but I'm in no hurry.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.820
(laughs)

02:20.860 --> 02:23.300
Whatever this is,

02:23.330 --> 02:26.090
we'll have time to figure it out
when we get home.

02:27.330 --> 02:30.370
We're really going home.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.400
That sounds good.

02:44.150 --> 02:46.150
(cell phone rings)

02:48.480 --> 02:50.450
(clears throat)

02:50.490 --> 02:51.920
Hey, honey.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.750
Hello?

02:54.790 --> 02:56.190
Sammy?

02:56.220 --> 02:57.620
Hi.

02:59.390 --> 03:01.290
I need to tell you something.

03:01.330 --> 03:02.700
What's wrong?

03:02.730 --> 03:03.340
Nothing.

03:03.380 --> 03:05.330
I'm-I'm fine.

03:05.370 --> 03:07.300
Um, but I'm not coming back.

03:07.330 --> 03:08.870
Not-not right now.
I-I just need to...

03:08.900 --> 03:11.000
W-W-Wait, what do you mean,
you're not coming back?

03:11.040 --> 03:13.650
There's a man inside Ma'an
who's fighting the Caliphate,

03:13.680 --> 03:16.040
and his name's Khalil.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.910
He needs money.

03:20.710 --> 03:22.080
I'm giving him my money,

03:22.120 --> 03:24.440
or as much of it as he can use.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.230
What?

03:25.270 --> 03:27.190
I'm just going there,
making sure it's him,

03:27.220 --> 03:28.690
and then I'll be right back.

03:28.720 --> 03:29.990
Sammy, listen to me.

03:30.020 --> 03:32.790
They killed Abdul.

03:32.840 --> 03:36.120
Threw him off a building
with eight other gay men.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.400
If I lived here,
it could have been me.

03:39.430 --> 03:40.820
But you don't live here, honey.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.510
You're an American kid
with money.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.300
Which is why I'm doing this.

03:44.340 --> 03:46.340
How are you even getting there?

03:46.370 --> 03:49.310
Abdul's friend
is taking me.

03:49.340 --> 03:51.310
Abdul's friend?

03:51.340 --> 03:52.950
Look, I know I'm taking a risk.

03:52.980 --> 03:54.130
Do you?

03:54.160 --> 03:56.180
What if he turns around
and holds you hostage?

03:56.210 --> 03:58.750
Then pay him.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.750
(phone beeps)

03:59.780 --> 04:01.720
Sammy...

04:07.060 --> 04:08.420
Who was that?

04:08.460 --> 04:10.880
Um, it was my lawyer.

04:17.529 --> 04:21.370
MARWAN: Black market traders
used these tunnels

04:21.399 --> 04:24.510
to avoid paying taxes
on goods in and out of Ma'an.

04:24.540 --> 04:28.080
The regime plugged most of them,
but they never found this one.

04:28.110 --> 04:30.340
(Sammy coughs violently)

04:33.980 --> 04:35.780
How can you breathe
down here, man?

04:35.820 --> 04:37.190
Ah, yeah. I...

04:37.220 --> 04:39.020
(coughs)

04:39.050 --> 04:40.790
(groans)

04:40.820 --> 04:43.810
There are other ways to
get your money to Khalil.

04:45.690 --> 04:47.690
I want to meet him.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.190
Okay, keep pressure
on the wound.

04:51.220 --> 04:52.870
(distant artillery fires)

04:52.900 --> 04:54.730
(explosion crashes)

04:56.670 --> 04:58.100
SIDDIQ: We just
lost two fighters.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.470
Did someone follow
you back here?

04:59.510 --> 05:01.160
- It's not the Caliphate.
- How do you know?

05:01.200 --> 05:03.680
They wouldn't attack us from the
air; they'd use ground forces.

05:03.710 --> 05:05.980
This is the government... they
must have spotted us flying over

05:06.010 --> 05:07.340
and mistaken us
for the Caliphate.

05:07.380 --> 05:08.280
Well, who are you calling?

05:08.320 --> 05:10.120
(explosion crashes)

05:12.560 --> 05:13.560
_

05:13.690 --> 05:15.080
_

05:15.420 --> 05:16.840
_

05:17.160 --> 05:19.270
_

05:20.860 --> 05:24.300
God in Heaven,
are you listening?

05:24.350 --> 05:26.540
Are you there?

05:28.120 --> 05:30.420
Is someone who has done
what I've done

05:30.470 --> 05:33.020
even allowed to pray to you?

05:34.740 --> 05:37.540
I don't know what to do.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.380
I can't bring my brother back.

05:40.410 --> 05:43.060
And there's not
enough rain in Abuddin

05:43.090 --> 05:46.370
to wash the blood from my hands.

05:48.420 --> 05:51.220
Am I being punished?

05:51.260 --> 05:53.640
I know I-I should be punished,

05:53.670 --> 05:57.480
but when does it end, and how?

05:58.730 --> 06:01.460
You want half my country?

06:01.500 --> 06:02.720
Take it.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.300
My grandson?

06:04.330 --> 06:06.170
You have him.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.170
What more do you want?

06:09.210 --> 06:12.570
When have I paid enough?

06:12.610 --> 06:15.010
You want to take me, yes?

06:15.040 --> 06:17.410
Take me.

06:18.710 --> 06:21.830
Just don't take my son.

06:21.860 --> 06:22.850
Please.

06:22.900 --> 06:27.040
Whatever you do,
don't take my son Ahmed.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.960
LEILA: You think praying
will solve our problems?

06:32.990 --> 06:35.430
We're dropping bombs in Ma'an.

06:35.430 --> 06:37.030
You have a war to run.

06:37.070 --> 06:38.770
This is my fault.

06:38.770 --> 06:40.270
For God's sake, Jamal.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.630
No, not in here.

06:41.670 --> 06:44.640
God has better things to do
than punish you.

06:51.580 --> 06:53.970
Whatever delusions you might
have about being punished

06:54.000 --> 06:55.380
you need to leave in here.

06:55.420 --> 06:58.950
You are the president of
Abuddin, commander in chief.

06:58.980 --> 07:02.320
Bassam betrayed you.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.320
Enough.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.760
(shouts in Arabic)

07:09.900 --> 07:11.970
RAMI:
<i>We're bombarding the northwest</i>

07:12.010 --> 07:15.800
outskirts of Ma'an,
beyond the 26th district.

07:15.830 --> 07:18.750
And here and here
along the western border.

07:18.790 --> 07:20.130
No man's land.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.040
An empty
industrial park.

07:22.070 --> 07:24.880
You wanted a victory.

07:24.910 --> 07:27.710
This is the best we could do
without killing civilians

07:27.760 --> 07:30.170
and turning the people
against us.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.920
The Caliphate is deeply embedded
in the local population.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.130
We can't make a plan
to retake the city

07:42.160 --> 07:44.330
until we have
proper intelligence.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.330
Mahmoud said he was developing
new assets inside Ma'an.

07:48.370 --> 07:50.370
Right, Solomon?

07:52.800 --> 07:55.170
He had a setback.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.810
One of Mahmoud's
informants

07:56.840 --> 07:59.340
turned out to be
a Caliphate plant.

07:59.380 --> 08:05.080
20 of his recruited assets
were executed late last night.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.950
Of course they were.

08:07.980 --> 08:13.660
A man can't win a war without
God being on his side.

08:13.690 --> 08:15.520
Without God?

08:19.840 --> 08:24.000
You are the only good news
I've had in a long time.

08:24.030 --> 08:26.690
An island in a
sea of troubles.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.040
I'm glad, Mr. President.

08:29.070 --> 08:31.470
You are my son.

08:31.510 --> 08:34.150
Call me Father.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.020
End this foolishness.

08:43.049 --> 08:46.620
Stop wasting good
bombs on bad targets.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.490
(bomb whistling)

08:51.530 --> 08:53.130
(shouting indistinctly)

08:55.930 --> 08:57.340
I need to talk to General Said.

08:57.380 --> 08:59.660
My name is Khalil.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.720
Yes, the same Khalil
who's fighting the Caliphate

09:01.750 --> 09:03.480
- inside Ma'an.
- (explosion crashes)

09:03.510 --> 09:06.480
You're not
targeting the Caliphate.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.750
You're hitting my fighters,
killing innocent people.

09:08.780 --> 09:11.290
You need to put me
through to General Said.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.150
What is it?

09:19.180 --> 09:20.700
(panting)

09:20.730 --> 09:24.720
Someone claiming to be Khalil
called the-the switchboard.

09:24.760 --> 09:25.990
He's on line three.

09:26.030 --> 09:28.130
Is he for real?

09:29.630 --> 09:31.230
He's on line three.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.200
Khalil, is it?

09:41.230 --> 09:43.410
This is General Said.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.300
General, you are
currently targeting

09:45.340 --> 09:47.950
your only potential allies
inside Ma'an.

09:47.980 --> 09:49.890
Your bombs just killed
three of my fighters

09:49.920 --> 09:51.780
and wounded another seven.

09:51.810 --> 09:52.680
And you expect me to believe

09:52.720 --> 09:54.870
you are who you claim
to be because...?

09:54.900 --> 09:58.010
I'm the one that broke
the Banu Zahra out of prison.

09:59.490 --> 10:00.910
That's public information.

10:00.940 --> 10:02.950
That doesn't mean you're Khalil.

10:04.690 --> 10:06.490
Okay, you want proof?

10:06.530 --> 10:08.130
I'll give you
a high-value target.

10:08.160 --> 10:09.520
Hit the northeast corner

10:09.550 --> 10:12.090
of Qusair Street and Idris.

10:16.810 --> 10:19.170
That is the residence
of the refinery manager.

10:19.210 --> 10:21.010
Not anymore.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.420
The Caliphate leadership
took it over.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.580
And you know this how?

10:28.250 --> 10:31.080
We conducted
reconnaissance.

10:31.120 --> 10:33.410
Abu Omar, Ihab Rashid...
all of them.

10:33.450 --> 10:37.390
That's where they are,
but I'm not sure for how long.

10:37.420 --> 10:40.260
General, I'm giving you
their headquarters.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.570
Or manipulating me
into killing civilians.

10:44.330 --> 10:47.030
You have to trust someone
on the ground inside Ma'an.

10:47.070 --> 10:48.670
Right now, you have no one.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.370
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
conducting bombing runs

10:50.410 --> 10:53.400
over empty industrial parks.

11:01.950 --> 11:03.980
I want to trust you.

11:04.020 --> 11:06.480
But I need something reliable.

11:06.520 --> 11:07.990
Proof.

11:08.020 --> 11:09.650
Like what?

11:09.690 --> 11:13.220
A Caliphate target.

11:13.260 --> 11:15.530
Tell me what
and when you're hitting it,

11:15.560 --> 11:17.490
and once it's reported
by a reliable source,

11:17.530 --> 11:20.260
then I'll know I can trust you.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.520
I'll be in touch.

11:23.870 --> 11:26.230
We could be missing the chance

11:26.270 --> 11:29.140
to decapitate their leadership.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.860
If we're wrong and we kill
innocent civilians,

11:30.900 --> 11:32.880
we're no better than they are.

11:32.910 --> 11:35.160
The people would
turn against us.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.910
Yes, it's a gamble.

11:37.950 --> 11:40.890
But shouldn't your father
be the one who decides

11:40.930 --> 11:43.520
if it's a gamble worth taking?

11:49.320 --> 11:51.610
Fine. I'll tell him.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.300
I need Munir to find us
another target.

11:56.330 --> 11:58.100
We may have an ally.

11:58.130 --> 12:00.370
You would work
with your brother?

13:15.870 --> 13:18.440
I keep thinking what
I could've done differently.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.580
No, this is not your fault.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.710
There must've been something.

13:21.750 --> 13:24.650
No one is blaming you.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.180
Ahmed's not blaming you.

13:27.220 --> 13:29.890
But everything's different now.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.420
Everything that I planned on.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.670
That's true,

13:35.700 --> 13:39.160
but we don't have
to talk about it yet.

13:39.190 --> 13:42.500
What do you mean?

13:42.530 --> 13:45.700
Why don't we take you home,
we get you better?

13:45.740 --> 13:48.900
No, tell me what it is that
we don't have to talk about yet.

13:55.650 --> 13:58.450
We're family.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.890
You're like a daughter to me.

14:00.930 --> 14:02.740
I mean that.

14:06.450 --> 14:09.220
But we're not
an ordinary family.

14:09.260 --> 14:12.560
We are the Al Fayeeds.

14:15.530 --> 14:18.530
My son will be president.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.130
And his son...

14:22.170 --> 14:25.090
will be president.

14:27.270 --> 14:29.780
A son that I cannot provide him.

14:29.810 --> 14:31.880
As much as Ahmed
loves you,

14:31.910 --> 14:34.610
he needs an heir.

14:34.650 --> 14:37.650
The people of Abuddin
need an heir.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.890
Especially now.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.710
And it's our job

14:42.750 --> 14:45.760
to do what's best
for the people.

14:45.790 --> 14:48.790
Does Ahmed know this?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.780
Not yet.

14:59.170 --> 15:01.370
But you'll convince him.

15:01.410 --> 15:04.440
You'll tell him
you're ending the marriage.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.440
For his sake.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.690
For the sake of Abuddin.

15:15.290 --> 15:19.790
Of course, we'll take care of
you wherever you decide to go.

15:19.820 --> 15:22.560
Anything you want,
anywhere you want.

15:22.590 --> 15:26.430
London, Paris, Dubai.

15:26.460 --> 15:30.520
You deserve... a life
outside of this place.

15:30.550 --> 15:33.850
It's taken far
too much from you.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.940
(grunting)

15:42.980 --> 15:45.440
This devil Khalil,

15:45.470 --> 15:46.910
he lived with you
for a month

15:46.940 --> 15:50.150
and you know nothing,
nothing about him, hmm?

15:50.190 --> 15:53.570
He stole your father's wife.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.050
He killed mine.

15:55.090 --> 15:56.920
ABU OMAR:
Ihab.

15:56.950 --> 16:00.390
- Nothing?
- Enough.

16:00.430 --> 16:03.680
Kasim's already told you
what he knows.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.800
Wait outside.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.870
You should take
three days.

16:28.910 --> 16:30.870
- I don't want three days.
- It's God's will.

16:30.910 --> 16:32.390
Hmm.

16:34.010 --> 16:36.620
As it was his will
to take Daliyah.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.620
Then it is God's will

16:41.660 --> 16:43.850
that I get my justice.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.370
You will have your justice.

16:47.410 --> 16:49.810
Already tonight,
we're rounding up the Christians

16:49.840 --> 16:51.110
and other apostates

16:51.140 --> 16:54.910
who we suspect are
supporting this man Khalil.

16:54.950 --> 16:58.620
"Christians."

16:58.650 --> 17:02.330
I want Khalil.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.609
OPERATOR: The number you
are calling has been disconnected.

17:09.260 --> 17:11.859
I finally talked to Ghani.

17:11.900 --> 17:15.230
Nasrin put him on the phone.

17:15.270 --> 17:16.900
He's good.

17:16.930 --> 17:18.930
He sounds good.

17:18.970 --> 17:21.670
He's not much
of a conversationalist.

17:21.700 --> 17:25.369
At least not with me.

17:25.410 --> 17:29.280
Maybe you'd be able
to get something out of him.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.780
What?

17:36.400 --> 17:39.420
It's Fauzi. Um...
I can't reach him. He...

17:39.450 --> 17:42.220
he's changed his number or...

17:43.420 --> 17:45.660
Sorry.
Tell me about Ghani.

17:47.030 --> 17:50.060
What good does it do
to call him?

17:50.100 --> 17:52.970
What if he's looking for her?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.270
Bassam.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.840
I want him to know.

17:56.870 --> 17:59.770
What?

17:59.810 --> 18:02.880
That you're sorry?

18:02.910 --> 18:07.010
That you need forgiveness?

18:07.050 --> 18:10.040
He won't be able
to give you that.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.290
I want him to know

18:15.320 --> 18:17.770
how hard she tried to be good

18:17.810 --> 18:21.090
and that no one
should ever judge her.

18:34.670 --> 18:37.440
I can't breathe.

18:41.310 --> 18:43.780
We just keep busy.

18:43.820 --> 18:47.520
We have things to do.

18:47.550 --> 18:49.620
HALIMA:
Khalil?

18:51.360 --> 18:54.160
Marwan is bringing someone
who wants to give us money.

18:54.190 --> 18:56.330
But he wants to meet you first.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.460
Who is it?

18:58.490 --> 19:01.060
Some rich kid from America.

19:02.430 --> 19:04.520
Don't worry.
If he doesn't checkout,

19:04.560 --> 19:06.070
we'll leave him there
rotting in the tunnel.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.740
(cell phone rings)

19:07.770 --> 19:09.450
It's Munir.

19:09.490 --> 19:10.820
Be careful.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.540
Always.

19:12.580 --> 19:13.980
You got my message.

19:14.010 --> 19:15.640
Yeah.

19:15.680 --> 19:19.020
Daliyah's safe here with us.

19:19.060 --> 19:20.200
Because of you.

19:20.240 --> 19:22.740
She's here because
of what you did.

19:24.750 --> 19:27.220
I'm glad.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.890
I am.

19:29.930 --> 19:32.730
But that woman who died...

19:32.760 --> 19:35.460
she was Ihab's wife.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.340
He is on a rampage.

19:40.370 --> 19:43.900
Just tell me you found a target.

19:43.940 --> 19:46.340
(indistinct chatter)

19:53.010 --> 19:56.590
Abu Omar is arresting
five families.

19:56.620 --> 20:00.000
Christian and other minorities
he thinks are supporting you.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.110
When's it happening?

20:01.140 --> 20:02.790
Tonight.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.500
That's enough time
to evacuate the families,

20:06.540 --> 20:08.130
set each house with explosives

20:08.160 --> 20:11.290
and detonate them once the
Caliphate soldiers are inside.

20:11.330 --> 20:12.760
You have the addresses?

20:12.800 --> 20:16.300
I had to get
into my brother's computer.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.200
He almost caught me.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.360
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

20:24.980 --> 20:28.380
Everything was normal last week.

20:28.410 --> 20:32.180
But it feels like ten years ago.

20:32.220 --> 20:34.850
Everyone's gone insane.

20:34.890 --> 20:37.490
My brother...

20:37.520 --> 20:40.290
he's not my brother anymore.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.370
(voice breaking):
It's like a nightmare,

20:46.400 --> 20:48.740
and I keep thinking
I'm going to wake up.

20:48.780 --> 20:51.340
- Hey, hey.
- (crying)

20:54.650 --> 20:56.010
It's okay.

20:56.050 --> 20:57.480
You'll be okay.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.100
♪

21:34.680 --> 21:36.330
Come on.

21:49.060 --> 21:50.290
Show me your hands.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.730
Keep them up unless
you want to die here.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.920
- Halima, it's me.
- Geez.

21:54.650 --> 21:56.590
- What...
- Hey, he's not armed.

21:56.630 --> 21:58.360
I used to be more trusting
than you, Marwan.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.620
Not anymore.

21:59.650 --> 22:01.410
He's got access to $10 million.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.830
Have you seen
this money?

22:02.870 --> 22:05.090
Not yet.
But I believe him.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.540
I need proof.

22:08.970 --> 22:10.610
Not until I see Abu Khalil.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.310
You don't make
the rules here.

22:14.580 --> 22:16.530
No weapon, but...

22:16.980 --> 22:18.950
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, back off!

22:21.920 --> 22:25.390
I'm Sammy Al Fayeed.

22:42.890 --> 22:46.780
(birds singing)

22:46.780 --> 22:50.450
I haven't seen you here
since your father died.

22:50.490 --> 22:51.820
JAMAL:
No.

22:51.860 --> 22:53.660
You haven't.

22:53.690 --> 22:55.100
And your mother?

22:55.140 --> 22:56.830
How is she?

22:56.860 --> 23:00.900
I didn't come
to discuss my mother.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.700
He is punishing me.

23:05.740 --> 23:07.300
God.

23:07.340 --> 23:10.060
I keep praying for forgiveness,

23:10.090 --> 23:12.810
to end the punishment, but...

23:12.840 --> 23:14.610
Forgiveness?

23:14.640 --> 23:16.630
For what?

23:19.510 --> 23:22.980
Dooming Bassam,
my brother.

23:24.940 --> 23:27.320
This is why you believe
God is punishing you.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.660
What else
would you call

23:29.700 --> 23:32.360
losing half
the country,

23:32.390 --> 23:33.960
my grandson?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.410
Everything
that's happened,

23:35.440 --> 23:37.700
everything that
keeps happening...

23:37.730 --> 23:39.900
Is God's will.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.700
It's God's will, is it?

23:43.740 --> 23:46.150
Or is it because of me?

23:49.240 --> 23:51.430
There must be some way

23:51.460 --> 23:53.380
to end all of this.

23:53.410 --> 23:56.580
Because if not,
Ihab Rashid will come for us.

23:56.620 --> 23:59.580
For me,
my family.

23:59.620 --> 24:03.390
They will destroy us
and Abuddin will fall.

24:03.420 --> 24:07.570
Like Libya.
And I'm not Gaddafi.

24:10.260 --> 24:13.510
You won't destroy the threat
from outside the Palace

24:13.550 --> 24:16.330
until you deal with the threat
from within.

24:16.370 --> 24:18.770
From within?

24:18.800 --> 24:20.840
Yes.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.230
Are you saying

24:25.270 --> 24:27.560
someone inside
the Palace

24:27.590 --> 24:31.250
is working against me?

24:34.050 --> 24:37.090
The poison lies within.

24:43.530 --> 24:44.760
(door opens)

24:48.200 --> 24:49.660
Where have you been?

24:49.700 --> 24:51.900
I've been looking
for you.

24:51.940 --> 24:53.300
Nowhere.

24:53.340 --> 24:54.670
Here.

24:56.150 --> 24:58.020
Organizing these.

24:58.060 --> 25:00.050
There's so many boxes, you know?

25:00.090 --> 25:02.280
Too many to count.

25:02.310 --> 25:04.540
I've been here,
counting.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.190
Okay, well, count later.

25:07.220 --> 25:08.320
You're coming with me.

25:08.350 --> 25:10.000
Where?

25:10.030 --> 25:12.940
I've got us both
onto one of the arrest teams.

25:15.660 --> 25:18.290
But we're not on the roster.

25:18.330 --> 25:19.830
Abu Omar
assigned me.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.920
He felt bad about
Ihab pushing me around,

25:21.960 --> 25:25.670
so I asked him
if you could come, too.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.940
I-I can't.

25:30.970 --> 25:33.210
I need to finish these.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.640
And I need you to help me.

25:35.670 --> 25:37.210
Maybe we can go
on the next one.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.470
(laughing):
Yeah, no, thanks.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.590
Whatever we collect,
we get five percent.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.640
You can finish
off later.

25:44.670 --> 25:46.090
You're my brother
and you're helping me.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.720
Let's go. Come on.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.870
(indistinct conversations)

26:01.900 --> 26:04.030
Detonators are armed.

26:04.070 --> 26:06.100
Say when.

26:07.870 --> 26:10.110
They should be here soon.

26:20.690 --> 26:24.700
They marked
all the Christian houses.

26:24.730 --> 26:27.170
We grew up with the Christians.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.750
They were our friends.

26:28.790 --> 26:30.190
Our neighbors.

26:30.230 --> 26:33.530
We all got along, but now...

26:39.930 --> 26:41.900
Okay, here they come.

26:48.510 --> 26:49.760
Everyone on my team, let's go.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.880
Tum'a Street, number 42.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.320
(indistinct chatter)

27:07.290 --> 27:08.530
BARRY:
Shit.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.800
It's Munir and his brother.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.400
What the hell is Munir doing?

27:12.430 --> 27:13.970
He knows what
he's walking into.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.390
They're headed to number 42.

27:15.430 --> 27:16.700
Kill the detonator
for number 42.

27:16.730 --> 27:17.490
I can't.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.310
They're all
wired together.

27:19.340 --> 27:20.810
It's all of them
or none of them.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.880
Shit, shit.

27:22.910 --> 27:26.010
(chatter, shouting)

27:31.420 --> 27:33.920
We should stand down.

27:33.950 --> 27:35.070
Munir's our inside man.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.540
We need him.

27:39.210 --> 27:40.750
Khalil...

27:42.830 --> 27:45.160
No.

27:45.200 --> 27:48.540
If we don't do this,
we lose General Said.

27:49.900 --> 27:52.800
We can't defeat the Caliphate
without him.

27:56.210 --> 27:58.640
(panting)

28:02.500 --> 28:03.840
Here, the door. Go.

28:03.870 --> 28:05.350
(knocking at door)

28:05.380 --> 28:06.460
MAN:
Open up.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.840
This is the army
of the Caliphate.

28:08.870 --> 28:11.350
Come on!
(knocking continues)

28:11.440 --> 28:14.060
Open the door or...
[continues indistinctly]

28:14.100 --> 28:16.330
- Open the door!
- KASIM: Just break it down!

28:16.360 --> 28:18.460
Kasim... Kasim!

28:19.100 --> 28:21.260
This is the army
of the Caliphate.

28:21.260 --> 28:23.430
(panting):
I'm feeling sick.

28:23.430 --> 28:24.810
- Wait, wait, wait.
- They're almost inside.

28:24.840 --> 28:25.870
- They'll see it's wired.
- I know.

28:25.900 --> 28:26.970
I know. I'll tell you when.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.770
You've got a problem?

28:29.810 --> 28:30.770
Now.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.200
I put my neck on...

28:48.660 --> 28:50.490
(screaming)

28:50.530 --> 28:52.290
(screams)

28:52.330 --> 28:53.820
Kasim!

28:55.200 --> 28:57.130
Kasim...

29:04.400 --> 29:05.610
He's alive.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.540
Let's go.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.280
(panting)

29:09.310 --> 29:10.910
(men sobbing, groaning)

29:17.350 --> 29:18.880
REPORTER: Multiple bombs
killed at least 20

29:18.910 --> 29:21.680
Caliphate fighters in Ma'an
a little over an hour ago.

29:21.720 --> 29:22.740
Claiming credit for the attack

29:22.780 --> 29:24.590
was the man
known only as Khalil,

29:24.620 --> 29:26.120
whose Red Hand Brigade is waging

29:26.150 --> 29:28.100
an increasingly
lethal insurgency.

29:28.140 --> 29:30.220
Meanwhile, ba...

29:30.260 --> 29:31.600
This man.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.640
Khalil.

29:33.640 --> 29:36.210
He's the break
we've been waiting for.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.910
Once we meet, we can work
up a plan and retake Ma'an.

29:38.950 --> 29:42.570
With a man you neglected
to tell me about until now?

29:42.600 --> 29:44.120
We...

29:44.150 --> 29:47.050
<i>I</i> was being cautious.

29:47.090 --> 29:49.170
Before I involved you,
I had to test him.

29:49.210 --> 29:50.460
See if he was telling the truth.

29:50.490 --> 29:52.340
Yeah, and by doing so,

29:52.380 --> 29:56.740
we lost an opportunity
to kill Ihab Rashid.

29:56.780 --> 29:58.660
It would have been
a reckless decision.

29:58.700 --> 30:02.600
That decision was mine
to make, not yours.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.710
From now on, no more decisions

30:07.740 --> 30:09.770
without my consent.

30:09.810 --> 30:12.290
As for Khalil,
no one speaks to him

30:12.330 --> 30:14.140
but me.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.150
Mahmoud,
come with me.

30:17.180 --> 30:19.020
Father...

30:19.050 --> 30:20.350
(footsteps recede)

30:24.750 --> 30:26.250
You knew about this?

30:26.290 --> 30:28.010
Sir...

30:28.040 --> 30:29.960
General Said said
he would tell you.

30:29.990 --> 30:31.460
I thought he had.

30:31.490 --> 30:34.250
I swear it.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.900
You, I trust.

30:37.930 --> 30:39.870
With Rami, I'm...

30:39.900 --> 30:41.800
I'm not so
sure anymore.

30:41.830 --> 30:43.180
Hmm.

30:43.220 --> 30:44.870
He made a mistake.

30:44.910 --> 30:47.040
Maybe.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.720
Maybe I made a mistake

30:49.760 --> 30:52.010
to let him into the Palace.

30:52.050 --> 30:54.440
Maybe that Rashid
blood in him

30:54.470 --> 30:57.380
burns too hot.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.550
This man, Khalil...

30:59.590 --> 31:02.960
I want to talk
to him myself.

31:02.990 --> 31:04.690
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm.

31:06.930 --> 31:09.260
My advice?

31:09.300 --> 31:11.110
Get a jet.

31:11.150 --> 31:14.000
Gassed. On the runway.

31:14.030 --> 31:15.530
So you can escape this nightmare

31:15.570 --> 31:17.900
that you're about
to find yourself in.

31:17.940 --> 31:19.900
I have been here before.

31:19.930 --> 31:21.570
More than once.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.580
You will not even
get a chance

31:25.610 --> 31:28.250
to fire a shot
at the Caliphate

31:28.280 --> 31:30.080
before Jamal turns on you.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.480
He's my father.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.490
My family.

31:37.490 --> 31:39.520
Idi Amin,

31:39.560 --> 31:42.080
Baby Doc,

31:42.110 --> 31:45.330
Saddam Hussein.

31:45.360 --> 31:49.100
Family is always
the first to disappear.

31:52.810 --> 31:54.410
Hey.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.640
DALIYAH:
What took you so long?

31:56.670 --> 31:58.640
We, uh, we went north
before doubling back.

31:58.680 --> 31:59.990
Siddiq thought we
were being followed.

32:00.020 --> 32:00.940
I was wrong.

32:00.980 --> 32:02.450
Better to be
safe than sorry.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.180
It's all over the news.

32:04.220 --> 32:06.220
Come.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.020
The young man
Halima went to meet.

32:12.050 --> 32:13.060
Is she okay?

32:13.090 --> 32:15.660
She's fine, of course.

32:15.690 --> 32:18.330
I just...

32:18.360 --> 32:21.060
I don't know
how to say this.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.000
Say what?

32:24.670 --> 32:26.670
He is your son.

32:29.210 --> 32:31.340
My son?

32:31.370 --> 32:34.680
Yes.

32:34.710 --> 32:37.150
That's...

32:37.180 --> 32:39.150
that's impossible.

32:39.180 --> 32:42.650
Apparently not,
because he's here.

32:42.680 --> 32:43.590
Send him away.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.120
Tell Halima to get him
out of the city.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.330
He-he cannot be here.
He can't know who I am.

32:47.330 --> 32:50.190
I realize this isn't
how you intended this to happen.

32:50.230 --> 32:52.030
But he's come all this way

32:52.060 --> 32:53.760
and he's got the money
that we need.

32:53.790 --> 32:55.960
What money?
He doesn't have any money.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.240
Yes, he does.

32:59.100 --> 33:02.250
He inherited it when you died.

33:07.270 --> 33:08.750
You have been hiding

33:08.780 --> 33:11.840
since the moment
that we met.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.980
And now your son
has found you.

33:29.550 --> 33:32.550
♪

33:57.290 --> 33:58.730
I know a thousand things

33:58.770 --> 34:01.790
are going through
your head right now.

34:05.230 --> 34:08.659
Jamal promised to execute me.

34:12.170 --> 34:15.570
But he couldn't do it.

34:15.600 --> 34:19.139
So he left me for dead
in the desert.

34:19.179 --> 34:21.980
I barely survived.

34:22.010 --> 34:25.050
Walked for days
in the sun.

34:26.449 --> 34:28.650
And since everyone

34:28.679 --> 34:30.780
that I know and love

34:30.820 --> 34:32.489
thought I was dead...

34:34.219 --> 34:38.090
...I decided
to stay that way.

34:38.130 --> 34:40.659
I couldn't
hurt you again.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.469
Your letter...

34:46.500 --> 34:47.909
was the last thing I saw

34:47.949 --> 34:50.670
before they took me
from my cell.

34:53.070 --> 34:54.210
(yells)

34:54.239 --> 34:57.210
(grunting)

34:57.250 --> 34:59.210
No!

34:59.250 --> 35:01.650
No.
(grunting)

35:02.880 --> 35:04.580
Let go of me!

35:04.620 --> 35:09.170
Let go!
(sobbing)

35:25.040 --> 35:26.850
How long till we get the money?

35:28.250 --> 35:29.480
A day.

35:29.510 --> 35:31.420
Less if we're lucky.

35:31.450 --> 35:32.720
Sammy's not stupid.

35:32.750 --> 35:33.710
He's a smart kid.

35:33.710 --> 35:35.920
Yeah, well, smart kids
do stupid things.

35:35.950 --> 35:37.520
What he's doing,

35:37.520 --> 35:39.130
what he's done,
it's pretty admirable.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.150
Jim, it's not like he stole
the keys to my car.

35:41.190 --> 35:43.250
He's going to a war zone.

35:49.070 --> 35:50.870
I'm sorry.

35:52.570 --> 35:54.940
No, I understand.

35:56.650 --> 35:59.580
But we'll get
through this.

35:59.610 --> 36:01.040
Once Jamal releases
the money,

36:01.080 --> 36:02.790
I'll transfer it to
an offshore trust

36:02.820 --> 36:05.150
for this guy Khalil.

36:14.420 --> 36:18.230
It was either this or smoking.

36:19.430 --> 36:21.330
He'll call soon.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.380
Sammy will call, we'll
send him the money,

36:23.410 --> 36:25.770
and we'll all go home.

36:28.570 --> 36:31.910
You know there was
a memorial service, right?

36:36.640 --> 36:39.250
Never occurred to me
you weren't actually dead.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.330
Sammy, I couldn't
tell you the truth.

36:44.080 --> 36:46.090
Bullshit.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.650
Bullshit.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.860
I'm a man sentenced to death
for treason.

36:54.130 --> 36:56.930
They would never
let us be together.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.070
All I'd have ever
been to you was a...

37:00.100 --> 37:02.070
a voice

37:02.100 --> 37:04.670
hiding out
on the end of the phone.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.310
Yeah, well,
maybe I would've liked

37:06.310 --> 37:08.440
to hear your voice
one more time.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.440
Yeah, me, too.

37:15.110 --> 37:18.540
But that voice would've
kept you from moving on.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.720
And your mom...

37:21.750 --> 37:25.390
would never have
let herself be free.

37:28.530 --> 37:30.930
And so I chose silence.

37:32.830 --> 37:36.280
And if that was wrong,
then it was wrong

37:36.310 --> 37:39.440
out of love,
not from cowardice.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.710
Is that what you tell yourself?

37:46.710 --> 37:48.440
(sniffles)

37:49.950 --> 37:52.210
You know what
the weirdest part is?

37:52.250 --> 37:56.790
Seeing you right now
standing in front of me alive...

37:56.830 --> 37:59.860
should be a relief.

37:59.890 --> 38:02.860
It should make me happy, but...

38:02.890 --> 38:05.830
growing up,
you just kept pushing me away

38:05.860 --> 38:08.900
over and over again.

38:08.930 --> 38:12.600
Made me feel like there
was something wrong with me.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.790
I thought you secretly hated me.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.570
I thought I was
a disappointment.

38:22.780 --> 38:26.180
But now I-I realize
that I-I wasn't.

38:27.980 --> 38:30.380
You were.
(laughs)

38:30.420 --> 38:34.720
I guess I have more
to apologize for than I thought.

38:37.420 --> 38:39.830
I guess you do.

38:39.860 --> 38:42.010
Sammy, I love you.

38:45.010 --> 38:46.500
But this is a war zone.

38:46.530 --> 38:48.160
You have to go home.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.700
I'm not going home.

38:50.740 --> 38:52.730
I can't protect
you here.

38:52.770 --> 38:56.170
I'm not asking you
for your protection.

38:56.210 --> 38:59.210
I'm still your father.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.960
No, you're not.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.010
My father's dead.

39:03.050 --> 39:05.050
You're Abu Khalil.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.730
Remember?

39:09.630 --> 39:13.420
And I'm not gonna sit by
and watch men like me die.

39:17.520 --> 39:20.430
You've got a call.
It's urgent.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.010
Show Sammy where he can
sleep tonight.

39:28.710 --> 39:30.670
You need to get some rest.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.280
It's President Al Fayeed.

39:47.090 --> 39:50.560
BARRY:
Mr. President?

39:52.130 --> 39:53.660
This is Khalil,

39:53.700 --> 39:55.800
commander of the Red Hand.

39:55.830 --> 39:59.020
I did what General Said
asked me to.

39:59.060 --> 40:02.100
Now I'm hoping we can find
a way to work together.

40:02.140 --> 40:06.090
Yeah, well, first tell me
who you are.

40:06.380 --> 40:08.680
I told you...
my name is Khalil.

40:08.710 --> 40:12.250
Yes, but who are you really?

40:15.320 --> 40:18.650
I'm someone that can help you
defeat the Caliphate.

40:18.690 --> 40:20.270
That's all you need to know.

40:20.310 --> 40:21.550
Hmm.
(chuckles)

40:21.590 --> 40:24.060
I suppose you are right.

40:24.090 --> 40:27.460
The thing is, in time of war,

40:27.500 --> 40:30.860
you can't be sure
about who to trust.

40:30.900 --> 40:33.870
But something
in your voice tells me

40:33.900 --> 40:36.340
you can be trusted.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.630
So...

40:38.660 --> 40:40.500
tell me, Khalil,

40:40.540 --> 40:43.710
can I trust you?

40:45.950 --> 40:48.180
Yes, Mr. President.

40:48.210 --> 40:50.350
Good.

40:50.380 --> 40:55.450
Because we have
a lot to talk about, you and I.
