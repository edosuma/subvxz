WEBVTT

00:02.989 --> 00:05.119
If we can't create
some sort of community,

00:05.120 --> 00:06.387
then what's the point?

00:06.388 --> 00:07.954
Kill each other
and get it all over with.

00:07.955 --> 00:09.857
I'm invested in protecting
the people of this city,

00:09.858 --> 00:11.391
and to do that, I need the key.

00:11.392 --> 00:12.378
I had Josh lift it for me.

00:12.379 --> 00:13.794
Off my uncle.

00:13.795 --> 00:15.929
My brother taught me
this code 15 years ago.

00:15.930 --> 00:17.364
You're Klaus' father?

00:17.365 --> 00:19.558
- I need you.
- What can I do?

00:19.559 --> 00:21.332
You can bring me back to life.

00:21.333 --> 00:24.673
A moonlight ring to protect
werewolves from the curse.

00:24.674 --> 00:25.706
What do I have to do?

00:25.707 --> 00:27.206
I need to know what stone it housed.

00:27.208 --> 00:30.010
A ring of empowerment, something
to control this curse.

00:30.011 --> 00:30.977
What kind of spell?

00:30.979 --> 00:32.279
A spell of my mother's.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.081
All I ask is that
the child is kept safe.

00:34.082 --> 00:37.662
Our daughter should be raised by
her parents in our family home.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.235
The ancestors want
us to kill Klaus' child.

00:40.236 --> 00:41.888
Whatever it is you got
coming with the wolves,

00:41.889 --> 00:44.877
just know that I'm gonna
fight for my guys,

00:44.878 --> 00:48.394
I'm gonna fight for my city, and
I will fight until I am dead.

00:48.396 --> 00:49.985
I would expect nothing less.

00:56.903 --> 01:00.106
Lot of driving
for a bag of rocks.

01:00.107 --> 01:02.474
We'll be in the quarter by dawn.

01:02.476 --> 01:04.077
Sure the hybrid will do his part?

01:04.078 --> 01:05.679
Hayley will make sure of that.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.481
Yeah. I forgot your fiancÃ©e has got
him wrapped around her finger.

01:08.482 --> 01:10.445
You know, Ollie, I love
you like a brother,

01:10.611 --> 01:14.187
but if you don't lay off Hayley,
we're gonna have a problem.

01:14.188 --> 01:15.784
Pay attention, Romeo.

01:20.126 --> 01:23.166
All right. Relax.

01:23.332 --> 01:25.131
We ain't done anything.

01:33.373 --> 01:34.761
Evening, officers.

01:34.927 --> 01:37.305
Step out of the car, both of you.

01:37.471 --> 01:40.680
What's this about?

01:40.681 --> 01:44.563
I think you should
do what the man says...

01:47.620 --> 01:51.111
Before things take a nasty turn.

01:54.601 --> 01:59.048

02:04.170 --> 02:07.573
Have I told you that you're awesome?

02:07.574 --> 02:12.090
Because you are, along with
the sun, daylight rings...

02:14.380 --> 02:17.846
That guy jogging in the tank top.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.640
Josh, now that you have a ring,

02:21.221 --> 02:23.222
I think you need to leave town.

02:23.223 --> 02:26.146
Whoa, wait.
We're breaking up?

02:26.312 --> 02:28.661
I'm serious.
Yeah. I know.

02:28.662 --> 02:30.029
Serious is kind of
your default setting,

02:30.030 --> 02:32.765
which is why you need me
around to lighten you up.

02:32.766 --> 02:35.200
Ergo, not leaving.

02:40.606 --> 02:42.241
Hey...

02:42.242 --> 02:43.246
You ok?

02:43.412 --> 02:45.678
Just witch stuff.

02:45.679 --> 02:48.335
Marcel came to me yesterday.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.683
He wanted a cloaking spell.

02:50.684 --> 02:53.786
He's gonna make a move
against Klaus, a big move.

02:53.787 --> 02:56.051
Wow. Ok. Guess he forgot to call me.

02:56.217 --> 02:59.257
Rude. Well, did you help him?

02:59.259 --> 03:00.759
Yes, because I don't
want him to get killed,

03:00.760 --> 03:02.294
but if Klaus finds out...

03:02.295 --> 03:03.629
Hey, look.

03:03.630 --> 03:06.698
If Marcel has got a plan,
maybe Klaus will buy a clue,

03:06.699 --> 03:08.105
realize he's a negative
on the popularity chart,

03:08.271 --> 03:10.469
and go into vampire retirement.

03:10.470 --> 03:12.526
I hear Palm Springs is nice.

03:14.273 --> 03:17.656
Klaus isn't the only thing
we need to be afraid of.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.244
Look. If there's a war coming,

03:19.245 --> 03:21.493
promise me you'll go before
you get caught up in it.

03:25.484 --> 03:29.221
Your mother's spell is as
complicated as it is elegant.

03:29.222 --> 03:31.795
She was clearly a very gifted witch.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.626
Is this the bit here?

03:34.627 --> 03:38.009
Hey, like I said, it's complicated.

03:38.175 --> 03:41.833
She bound protection magic
to black kyanite stones.

03:41.834 --> 03:44.669
A werewolf with the stones is
free from turning on a full moon.

03:44.670 --> 03:46.101
And what of the improvements?

03:46.267 --> 03:48.979
This spell will enhance
speed, strength, and agility.

03:49.508 --> 03:51.643
There should be something
in there about fangs.

03:51.644 --> 03:54.526
It's what my mother used on us
when she turned us into vampires.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.348
Not just fangs.

03:56.349 --> 04:01.658
You said you want venom so the
bite is still lethal to vampires.

04:01.824 --> 04:05.412
Hmm. Here.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.038
Should make a nice gift.

04:07.204 --> 04:08.960
I'm sure Hayley will be thrilled.

04:08.961 --> 04:10.462
Oh, not just Hayley.

04:10.463 --> 04:12.597
You'll be making quite a few of these.

04:12.598 --> 04:15.700
Let's call it an even hundred.

04:15.701 --> 04:17.802
That's not the deal
I made with Elijah.

04:17.803 --> 04:20.427
Well, you're dealing with me now...

04:20.593 --> 04:25.765
And I am offering considerably more.

04:25.931 --> 04:28.018
You think because I sleep with you,

04:28.184 --> 04:29.728
I'm suddenly at your beck and call.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.646
Because you sleep with me, luv,

04:32.117 --> 04:34.485
I will protect you from those
who might do you harm,

04:34.486 --> 04:36.954
including my brother.

04:36.955 --> 04:39.946
Because I need you, however,

04:40.112 --> 04:44.896
I'm prepared to offer something
more valuable than my protection.

04:44.897 --> 04:47.165
Which is what?

04:47.166 --> 04:50.957
My mother's grimoire, from
which I took these spells.

04:51.123 --> 04:54.211
You see, Elijah is offering
you a mere peek at its pages,

04:54.377 --> 04:58.342
but I will grant it to you as a gift

04:58.343 --> 05:01.479
if you pledge your loyalty to me,

05:01.480 --> 05:04.849
beginning with the creation
of those rings.

05:04.850 --> 05:08.099
This has been your plan all along.

05:08.654 --> 05:12.089
You want to build a werewolf army,
and you're using me to do it.

05:12.090 --> 05:16.149
Sweetheart, I'm not the enemy.

05:16.315 --> 05:18.062
Nor are the wolves.

05:18.063 --> 05:20.898
Your abusive coven expects
you to sacrifice yourself

05:20.899 --> 05:23.156
for the last of the harvest girls.

05:25.069 --> 05:28.161
Do this one favor for me,

05:28.327 --> 05:34.084
and you need never fear
anyone ever again.

05:36.000 --> 05:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.621 --> 05:47.624
Ma'am, you need to leave.

05:47.625 --> 05:50.517
Hey, hey, what's going on?

05:50.683 --> 05:52.596
Folks, you need to leave now.

05:52.597 --> 05:54.854
Hey...
Hey, what are you...

05:55.433 --> 05:57.899
I tried
to be nice about this.

05:58.065 --> 06:00.944
Who the hell do you think you are?

06:01.110 --> 06:03.974
I am the new owner
of this gumbo shack.

06:03.975 --> 06:05.741
Ink is not dry on the contract yet,

06:06.323 --> 06:07.878
but I can tell you, I got it cheap.

06:07.879 --> 06:09.313
Business is not what is used to be

06:09.314 --> 06:11.997
since Sophie Deveraux
kicked the bucket.

06:14.084 --> 06:16.619
Look. I don't want any trouble.

06:16.621 --> 06:19.122
I don't really care what you want.

06:19.123 --> 06:20.957
Let's talk about what I want.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.257
Right.
My uncle's key.

06:22.423 --> 06:26.463
You said you were gonna use it to
protect the innocents of the city.

06:26.464 --> 06:29.766
Seems pretty ironic,
given your line of work.

06:29.767 --> 06:33.810
I'm a legitimate businesswoman who's
never been convicted of a crime,

06:33.976 --> 06:37.825
and, as leader of the human faction,

06:37.826 --> 06:41.478
that key is mine.

06:41.479 --> 06:44.547
I gave you time to mourn.

06:44.548 --> 06:46.281
Now time is up.

06:46.447 --> 06:49.685
Message received.

06:49.687 --> 06:53.655
Let me just go find
that key I don't have.

06:53.657 --> 06:55.358
My family has been in New Orleans

06:55.359 --> 06:59.996
for a long time, Cami,
even longer than yours,

06:59.997 --> 07:03.500
and we've learned
it's a very hard city

07:03.501 --> 07:06.343
to get by in if you
don't have any friends.

07:08.171 --> 07:10.472
I'd like to be your friend.

07:10.638 --> 07:14.777
So I'm gonna give you until tomorrow,

07:14.778 --> 07:17.771
and after that,
I won't be so friendly.

07:30.527 --> 07:32.161
Uh! Uh!

07:32.162 --> 07:33.453
Uh! Uh!

07:33.619 --> 07:34.704
Leave him alone!

07:34.870 --> 07:37.700
We'll leave your boy alone when
you tell us what Klaus is up to.

07:37.701 --> 07:40.303
How the hell should
I know what he is up to?

07:40.304 --> 07:42.872
See, I know you've been meeting him.

07:42.873 --> 07:46.576
The stones in your duffel bag,
it's black kyanite.

07:46.577 --> 07:48.177
It's pretty rare.

07:48.178 --> 07:50.346
I also know enough about witchcraft

07:50.347 --> 07:54.250
to recognize the
ingredients of a spell.

07:54.251 --> 07:58.019
So you gonna make me ask again?

08:01.857 --> 08:03.483
Ok.

08:06.162 --> 08:10.131
You want to know the problem
with having two werewolf hostages?

08:11.200 --> 08:14.236
You really only need one.

08:14.237 --> 08:17.339
You crescent boys, you
think you're a bunch of badasses,

08:17.340 --> 08:18.741
but back in '25, I wiped out

08:18.742 --> 08:20.415
a whole bloodline
of Guerrera werewolves.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.978
They were a lot tougher than you.

08:22.979 --> 08:25.255
Wait!

08:31.553 --> 08:36.558
You let him go, I will
tell you about the stones,

08:36.558 --> 08:40.979
about Klaus...
Whatever.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.106
Gah!

08:43.272 --> 08:44.867
All right. All right.

08:44.868 --> 08:46.969
A deal is a deal,
but since nirvana here

08:46.970 --> 08:49.204
is gonna turn into a wolf
in about 8 hours, D.,

08:49.205 --> 08:51.607
drop his ass off way out in the bayou.

08:51.608 --> 08:53.950
Will I at least get to kill this fool?

08:56.201 --> 08:58.163
No. I got a better idea.

09:07.323 --> 09:08.590
Yes, brother?
What is it?

09:08.756 --> 09:11.460
It appears our wolves have
gone astray, brother.

09:11.461 --> 09:12.660
They should've been back hours ago.

09:12.662 --> 09:13.929
We need to find them.

09:13.930 --> 09:15.230
Well, that might be a bit tricky.

09:15.231 --> 09:16.890
You see, we've located their car

09:17.056 --> 09:19.058
on a back road
in the middle of nowhere.

09:19.224 --> 09:21.236
I suspect they've been shanghaied.

09:21.237 --> 09:23.772
And you didn't feel the need
to share this information?

09:23.773 --> 09:26.174
It was my intention
to present you with the problem

09:26.175 --> 09:28.318
only after I'd found
an appropriate solution.

09:28.484 --> 09:29.811
Well, do enlighten us.

09:29.812 --> 09:31.580
I'm closing in on it as we speak.

09:31.581 --> 09:34.616
The only person who would be
bold enough to snatch

09:34.617 --> 09:37.618
my wolf allies is the one
who has the most to lose.

09:37.620 --> 09:40.622
Marcel.
No. He'll kill them.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.090
Genevieve assures me

09:42.091 --> 09:44.659
that Marcel has procured
a cloaking spell.

09:44.660 --> 09:47.378
The only witch who will
aid Marcel is Davina.

09:47.544 --> 09:50.532
I just need to get
one last bit of leverage

09:50.533 --> 09:52.759
before I pay her a visit...

09:57.238 --> 10:00.141
And there it is.

10:00.307 --> 10:01.676
Hello, Joshua.

10:01.677 --> 10:03.710
Agh...

10:13.971 --> 10:16.241
Davina...

10:28.652 --> 10:30.187
Uh!

10:30.188 --> 10:32.757
Josh?
I'm sorry.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.467
What happened?

10:34.992 --> 10:38.295
Joshua went and got
himself a werewolf bite.

10:38.296 --> 10:41.865
Well, a hybrid bite, technically,
but it will kill him just the same.

10:41.866 --> 10:43.433
Why are you doing this?

10:43.434 --> 10:44.433
I blame you.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.236
After all my overtures of friendship,

10:46.237 --> 10:50.340
you once again sided with Marcel,
forcing me to do horrible things

10:50.341 --> 10:52.777
to someone you care about.

10:54.711 --> 10:57.647
I'm not without mercy, Davina.

10:57.648 --> 11:01.077
I can cure him,
but you have to cooperate

11:01.243 --> 11:03.352
and tell me where to find Marcel.

11:03.354 --> 11:05.707
Why, so you can kill him, too?

11:06.223 --> 11:09.259
Marcel chose his path.

11:09.260 --> 11:13.262
Seems unfair that Josh
should have to suffer for it.

11:17.033 --> 11:18.535
Davina...

11:18.536 --> 11:21.069
He's at a warehouse at the docks...

11:21.555 --> 11:22.807
Thierry's place.

11:23.374 --> 11:24.707
You see?

11:24.708 --> 11:27.410
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

11:27.411 --> 11:30.680
What about Josh?

11:30.681 --> 11:32.567
Well, he'll live
another 24 hours or so.

11:32.733 --> 11:36.070
I may need you, and Joshua
serves as wonderful leverage.

11:36.236 --> 11:41.390
The next time I ask a
question, answer quicker.

11:44.227 --> 11:46.529
Thank you for your time.

11:46.530 --> 11:48.364
I didn't realize my uncle
even had this place

11:48.365 --> 11:50.032
until a read about it in his will.

11:50.033 --> 11:52.468
This building has been in
my family for decades.

11:52.469 --> 11:55.632
You uncle helped us raise the funds
to restore it after Katrina.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.041
I figured he'd kept this
room for extra space.

11:59.042 --> 12:01.137
Anyway, I didn't ask any questions.

12:03.546 --> 12:08.683
You know, Father K.,
he was as good as they come.

12:08.685 --> 12:10.688
Sorry for your loss.

12:16.192 --> 12:18.112
Um...

12:18.278 --> 12:19.739
Do you mind if I go in alone?

13:06.174 --> 13:09.377
Here's to buried treasure.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.474
Hello.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.736
Elijah should've called by now.

14:22.217 --> 14:24.285
Worrying isn't going to help.

14:24.286 --> 14:26.949
You should sit down, try to keep calm.

14:27.115 --> 14:32.393
What are you now,
magician-slash-zen life coach?

14:32.394 --> 14:34.562
The treatment of pregnant women

14:34.563 --> 14:36.864
has advanced remarkably
since I was a nurse,

14:36.865 --> 14:40.535
but even I know high blood pressure
is bad for you and your baby,

14:40.536 --> 14:44.305
especially now that
you're so close to term.

14:44.306 --> 14:46.040
I hate this.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.943
I feel completely useless.

14:48.944 --> 14:52.683
Don't you get it?
You're the point of all this.

14:52.849 --> 14:57.985
Klaus and Elijah running all
over town, it's all for you.

14:57.986 --> 14:59.920
I'm a bit envious.

14:59.921 --> 15:01.651
Great. Lucky me.

15:03.157 --> 15:04.737
Is there anything I can get you?

15:05.227 --> 15:07.031
How about a moonlight ring?

15:07.197 --> 15:11.160
The spell can't be performed until
the full moon reaches its apex,

15:11.326 --> 15:16.431
and, of course, I need the stones,
which will be here soon enough.

15:17.749 --> 15:19.210
Have a little faith.

15:29.817 --> 15:31.285
Accolades to Marcel.

15:31.286 --> 15:34.475
He did quite a dance across
the bridge of your nose.

15:34.641 --> 15:35.855
Where is he now?

15:35.857 --> 15:41.561
Nowhere to be found...

15:43.497 --> 15:47.822
Although he did leave us
a delightful parting gift.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.282
What about the stones?

15:49.448 --> 15:51.871
I don't know. Untie me.
I'll help you find them.

15:51.873 --> 15:52.952
Sit still.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.538
You'll be freed as soon as it's safe.

15:58.612 --> 16:01.794
Our focus should be the stones.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.483
Considering Jackson is competition

16:03.484 --> 16:05.619
for Hayley's affection,
I think you'd agree.

16:05.620 --> 16:07.020
Disregard my brother.

16:07.021 --> 16:08.455
Over the course
of the last millennium,

16:08.456 --> 16:10.344
his capacity for tact
is somewhat diminished.

16:10.510 --> 16:12.125
Oh, that's typical, isn't it?

16:12.126 --> 16:14.026
Marcel fills a room with dynamite,

16:14.598 --> 16:16.225
and yet I'm the tactless one.

16:16.391 --> 16:19.332
I recognize these explosives
from the attack on the bayou.

16:19.333 --> 16:23.024
Could you remind me again why you
believed that Marcel was innocent?

16:23.190 --> 16:27.528
Remind me to ask him before
I pull out his innards.

16:29.943 --> 16:31.645
Ah. Ok.

16:31.646 --> 16:34.243
Exercise extreme caution
in this general area.

16:34.409 --> 16:35.548
Bit of a mess.

16:37.785 --> 16:40.416
Impeccable timing.

16:40.582 --> 16:41.755
What's going on?

16:41.756 --> 16:42.922
Jackson is fine.

16:42.923 --> 16:44.557
He's a little tied up right now.

16:44.558 --> 16:46.422
Could we call you back?

16:50.842 --> 16:52.065
Oh, that doesn't bode well.

16:52.066 --> 16:53.596
Jackson; Are you trying to kill us?

16:53.762 --> 16:55.567
Elijah, tell me what's going on now.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.626
Thank God you're alive.

17:17.627 --> 17:19.497
Ok.

17:22.498 --> 17:26.501
I'm fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

17:26.502 --> 17:28.536
What about the stones?

17:28.538 --> 17:31.472
Scattered across the bed of
the Mississippi, I imagine.

17:31.474 --> 17:33.008
Marcel is no fool.

17:33.009 --> 17:34.376
He knows an empowered werewolf army

17:34.377 --> 17:36.878
would mean the end of vampires
in New Orleans.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.048
The explosion is his way of
saying he means to prevent that,

17:40.049 --> 17:41.782
for all the good it'll do him.

17:41.784 --> 17:43.718
Well, it did him pretty
damn well, didn't it?

17:43.720 --> 17:46.232
This is my fault.
I will find a way to fix it.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.924
No, Jack. You're hurt,
and no one is blaming you.

17:48.925 --> 17:51.112
I'm blaming you.

17:51.278 --> 17:55.063
Those stones will be hard to replace.

17:55.064 --> 17:58.799
Fortunately, I always have
a backup plan.

18:00.068 --> 18:01.903
You can't seriously mean her.

18:01.904 --> 18:03.104
She's a gangster.

18:03.105 --> 18:06.877
I see her more as a means to procuring
rare items at short notice.

18:07.443 --> 18:09.778
Greetings, Ms. Correa.

18:09.779 --> 18:11.924
I see you've brought company.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.415
These are my brothers.

18:13.416 --> 18:16.150
I always include them
in delicate business matters.

18:16.152 --> 18:19.265
Fellas, meet Mr. Mikaelson.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.523
Please, call me Klaus.

18:21.524 --> 18:23.090
All my friends do.

18:23.092 --> 18:24.729
I don't know if I'd call us friends,

18:24.895 --> 18:28.129
but if you and Marcel are planning
on having a little throwdown,

18:28.130 --> 18:32.945
I'd prefer my family to be on the
same side as the inevitable Victor.

18:33.111 --> 18:34.936
Then you have what I asked for.

18:34.937 --> 18:39.174
Not enough for an army at such
short notice, but it's start.

18:39.175 --> 18:43.011
Strange, I wasn't aware that she
was familiar with our plan.

18:43.012 --> 18:45.946
My price for doing business
is full disclosure.

18:45.948 --> 18:47.460
Your brother complied.

18:48.017 --> 18:50.752
How does the human faction
expect to benefit from all this?

18:50.753 --> 18:54.592
I only want to solidify our
allegiance to the ruling class.

18:55.157 --> 18:56.457
It's good for business.

18:56.458 --> 18:59.472
If only everyone shared
your capacity for reason.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.129
Sadly, they don't.

19:01.130 --> 19:03.697
Marcel is being especially vindictive.

19:03.699 --> 19:05.633
I'm worried he might come after me

19:05.634 --> 19:08.503
or my family just
for meeting with you.

19:08.504 --> 19:12.240
It might be in our best interests
if we combine our efforts.

19:12.241 --> 19:13.941
So be it.

19:13.942 --> 19:17.677
The more bodies we have to
defend the compound, the better.

19:17.679 --> 19:19.658
Let's get started, shall we?

19:23.384 --> 19:26.354
There.
Thank you.

19:26.355 --> 19:27.722
Don't thank me.

19:27.723 --> 19:29.690
It was Elijah who vamped
your ass to safety.

19:29.691 --> 19:33.260
Yeah. He really seems
to care about you.

19:33.261 --> 19:35.196
It's complicated.

19:35.197 --> 19:38.385
I think that's the
understatement of the year.

19:38.551 --> 19:44.038
Look. I got to go, get back to the
bayou before the moon rises, so...

19:44.039 --> 19:46.477
Jackson, this will be the last time.

19:46.643 --> 19:50.523
After tonight, you'll
never have to turn again...

19:50.689 --> 19:54.110
No more pain, no more hiding
in the bayou, I promise.

19:54.276 --> 19:59.085
You know, Klaus isn't doing this
out of the kindness of his heart.

19:59.614 --> 20:02.523
He's doing it for you, Hayley.

20:02.524 --> 20:05.079
You're the one who's gonna
change everything for us.

20:09.563 --> 20:12.920
Seems I owe you yet again.

20:20.674 --> 20:24.377
I understand he risked
his life to save his friend.

20:25.779 --> 20:27.726
He's a good man.

20:28.283 --> 20:30.851
Yes. He is.

20:30.852 --> 20:34.358
Elijah, there is something
that I need to tell you.

20:35.922 --> 20:40.761
My family wanted me...

20:40.762 --> 20:45.399
I was supposed to be
betrothed to Jackson.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.134
I wanted to tell you sooner.

20:47.135 --> 20:49.535
I just didn't know how.
It's this insane custom.

20:49.537 --> 20:51.605
No. You don't need
to explain anything.

20:51.606 --> 20:55.421
I understand the need to make
sacrifices for one's family.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.245
Oh, come on, Elijah.

20:58.246 --> 21:01.510
For once in your immortal life,
can you just not be so noble?

21:01.676 --> 21:02.970
What would you have me do?

21:03.136 --> 21:05.218
I just told you that I'm betrothed

21:05.219 --> 21:10.269
according to some backwater arrangement
by people that I never knew.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.992
Tell me that you think
betrothals are stupid.

21:12.993 --> 21:15.608
Tell me that I have a choice.

21:27.073 --> 21:29.538
You will always have a choice.

21:37.670 --> 21:39.548
I trust you are ready.

21:39.714 --> 21:42.301
The last ingredient is personal.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.924
As this spell is designed
to control transformation,

21:44.925 --> 21:48.261
I need the blood of a werewolf
who doesn't turn on a full moon.

21:48.262 --> 21:50.696
My first thought was Hayley
because of the pregnancy.

21:50.698 --> 21:52.498
Out of the question.

21:52.499 --> 21:53.933
I'd just as soon limit the mother

21:53.934 --> 21:57.900
of my unborn child to the side
effects of your witchery.

21:58.066 --> 22:01.862
I am half wolf.
I control my form.

22:02.028 --> 22:04.323
Use my blood.

22:09.715 --> 22:14.291
If you fail to uphold
your end of the deal,

22:14.788 --> 22:19.824
the consequences for you
will be apocalyptic.

22:19.826 --> 22:23.928
You say the most romantic things.

22:40.079 --> 22:44.530
I appreciate you all coming.
It's been a while.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.386
By now, you've heard what's going on.

22:47.387 --> 22:51.390
Klaus found a way to make
werewolves lethal to us 24/7.

22:51.391 --> 22:55.499
The fireworks at the docks, that
was me trying to spoil his plan.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.294
He's moving forward, anyway.

22:58.832 --> 23:02.067
He's got as witch, he's got a spell,

23:02.068 --> 23:07.770
and if he pulls this off, in one
night, we go from hunter to prey.

23:08.341 --> 23:11.410
Now, I know what
some of y'all are thinking.

23:11.411 --> 23:14.579
"We stood against Klaus before,
and we failed."

23:15.143 --> 23:18.717
Uh-uh. That's on me.
I failed.

23:18.718 --> 23:20.719
I called off the attack
because I thought it was

23:20.720 --> 23:24.188
the only way to save lives,
but make no mistake.

23:24.190 --> 23:26.792
If we don't stand against him now,

23:26.793 --> 23:30.561
our lives aren't worth a damn, anyway.

23:30.563 --> 23:32.130
Yeah.

23:32.131 --> 23:35.767
Wise man said, "if you know
yourself and know your enemy,

23:35.768 --> 23:38.876
then you don't need to fear
the outcome of battle."

23:39.042 --> 23:43.797
I know myself, I know my
friends, and I know my enemy.

23:43.963 --> 23:46.967
I know his strengths,
I know his pride,

23:47.133 --> 23:51.015
and I know his house,
every nook and cranny.

23:51.017 --> 23:53.385
We're gonna go there tonight

23:53.386 --> 23:56.101
hard and fast all at once
from every angle.

23:56.267 --> 24:00.272
We kill their witch, destroy her
spell book, and get the hell out...

24:00.438 --> 24:02.159
Yeah!
Yeah!

24:02.161 --> 24:05.630
And as for Klaus,
he'll be coming for me,

24:05.631 --> 24:07.654
and that's exactly what I want.

24:07.820 --> 24:09.615
I'll lead him away.

24:09.781 --> 24:13.160
I just need the rest of you
to get past Elijah

24:13.326 --> 24:15.996
and do what needs to be done.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.290
So that's the plan.

24:18.844 --> 24:22.379
I need to know right now,
who's with me?

24:22.381 --> 24:24.548
Yeah!
Yeah!

24:37.492 --> 24:39.436
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

24:39.602 --> 24:42.129
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

24:42.131 --> 24:44.817
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.468
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

24:46.469 --> 24:50.772
My people say Marcel is on the
move and he's bringing friends.

24:50.773 --> 24:52.140
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

24:52.141 --> 24:53.842
Get Hayley to safety.

24:53.843 --> 24:55.342
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

24:55.344 --> 24:57.112
Come with me.
No.

24:57.113 --> 24:59.123
Someone needs to watch her.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.382
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

25:01.384 --> 25:03.127
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

25:03.293 --> 25:04.686
You should help Klaus.

25:04.687 --> 25:06.186
My brothers and their security detail

25:06.188 --> 25:08.549
won't be much against a vampire army.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.125
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

25:11.127 --> 25:12.993
I'll stay with Hayley.

25:12.995 --> 25:14.396
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

25:14.397 --> 25:16.797
Go, Elijah...

25:16.799 --> 25:19.017
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

25:19.183 --> 25:20.811
And don't hold back.

25:20.977 --> 25:24.505
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

25:24.507 --> 25:27.609
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

25:27.610 --> 25:30.028
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

25:46.586 --> 25:48.563
I thought this lot would've
learned their lesson.

25:48.564 --> 25:52.032
Well, they're not exactly
renowned for their genius.

25:52.034 --> 25:55.012
So where's the ringleader
of this circus...

25:56.804 --> 25:59.183
Too afraid to show his face?

25:59.349 --> 26:01.375
I'm here.

26:01.376 --> 26:06.547
I'm gonna offer you one last
chance to pack your stuff

26:06.548 --> 26:08.149
and get the hell out of my town.

26:08.150 --> 26:12.286
Or what, you'll allow your
men to rush to their deaths again?

26:12.287 --> 26:13.554
Look around.

26:13.555 --> 26:15.282
Every vampire in the quarter came out.

26:15.448 --> 26:19.860
They want their city back,
no surrender this time.

26:19.861 --> 26:21.955
You're gonna have to kill us all.

26:22.431 --> 26:24.697
Ok.

26:24.699 --> 26:26.934
I think I'll start with you.

26:26.935 --> 26:30.404
Fine. Come get me.

26:30.405 --> 26:32.090
If you don't kill him, I will.

26:32.256 --> 26:34.607
He's mine.

26:34.609 --> 26:37.763
This won't take long.

26:38.246 --> 26:41.414
Gentlemen...

26:41.416 --> 26:43.584
Shall we?

26:43.585 --> 26:45.395
Raah!
Raah!

26:56.096 --> 26:57.449
Not bad,

26:57.932 --> 27:00.536
but not nearly good enough.

27:05.205 --> 27:08.040
How pathetic you've become.

27:08.042 --> 27:11.745
Explosives, Marcellus, really?

27:11.746 --> 27:14.925
I should've know it was you who
detonated those bombs in the bayou.

27:15.091 --> 27:17.761
The docks, that was me.

27:17.927 --> 27:19.953
I got the detonators from Francesca.

27:19.954 --> 27:22.307
Why don't you ask her
about the bayou bombing?

27:22.473 --> 27:24.851
Lies and distractions.

27:25.017 --> 27:27.461
I never went after Hayley.

27:27.462 --> 27:30.464
I'm not a monster, Klaus.

27:30.465 --> 27:33.402
I'm not you.

27:59.459 --> 28:03.724
My family has been in New
Orleans for a long time.

28:16.109 --> 28:18.155
Flank him!
Take him down now!

28:22.749 --> 28:24.983
Aah!

28:32.525 --> 28:34.460
Ms. Correa, we need to go.

28:34.461 --> 28:36.496
Your brothers are already
heading out the back.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.830
Not yet.

28:37.831 --> 28:41.366
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

28:41.368 --> 28:44.302
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

28:44.304 --> 28:47.976
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

28:48.142 --> 28:50.510
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

28:50.511 --> 28:54.858
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

28:59.987 --> 29:03.923
The stones are finished.
I've done my part.

29:03.924 --> 29:05.391
Now it's up to you.

29:05.392 --> 29:06.926
I'll get them to the bayou.

29:06.927 --> 29:09.695
Actually, she was talking to me.

29:09.696 --> 29:11.297
What the hell is this?

29:11.298 --> 29:13.043
Call it a side deal.

29:13.567 --> 29:17.297
Point is, I'm taking the stones.

29:17.463 --> 29:18.903
Are you out of your mind?

29:18.905 --> 29:21.039
You think that humans
can go up against Klaus?

29:21.041 --> 29:24.012
No. I don't, but I'm not human.

29:36.088 --> 29:41.446
I'm like you, Hayley, and now
I'm gonna take back my town.

29:41.995 --> 29:44.563
Like hell, you are.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.645
Don't look so dour, Genevieve.

29:59.646 --> 30:01.239
We both got what we wanted.

30:22.512 --> 30:26.658
Marcellus,
how well your name fits you,

30:26.824 --> 30:29.453
little warrior,

30:29.454 --> 30:32.221
though ultimately one
of no consequence.

30:39.162 --> 30:42.299
My name is Marcel.

30:45.001 --> 30:47.204
Is there no end to your defiance?

30:47.205 --> 30:50.340
You summoned Mikael,
turned Rebekah against me,

30:50.341 --> 30:55.912
tried to bury me in your garden,
and yet you always fail.

30:56.981 --> 31:01.797
What is there left to do but
put you out of your misery?

31:02.853 --> 31:04.362
Raah!

31:07.190 --> 31:10.393
Hayley, I've called 6 times.
Call me back.

31:10.394 --> 31:11.895
You said you wanted
to know if I learned

31:11.896 --> 31:13.329
anything about Francesca Correa.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.916
Her family is descended
from a werewolf bloodline.

31:17.834 --> 31:22.756
We've spent two generations
living a lie, and now our time...

31:22.922 --> 31:24.508
Our time has come.

31:28.544 --> 31:31.280
You know what do to.

31:33.316 --> 31:35.602
Aagh!

31:44.827 --> 31:47.280
Ahh! Uh! Uh!

31:56.973 --> 31:59.140
Uh!

32:02.178 --> 32:03.679
Yeah.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.590
Agh!

32:16.092 --> 32:17.936
Raah!

32:23.933 --> 32:26.235
Are we done?

32:26.236 --> 32:29.772
Well, nice job.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.739
Saved me the trouble

32:32.283 --> 32:35.177
of killing all these vampires myself.

32:35.178 --> 32:36.177
Rrgh!
Raah!

32:36.680 --> 32:38.013
Aagh!

32:38.014 --> 32:39.048
Argh! Rrgh!

32:39.049 --> 32:40.515
Agh! Aah!

32:43.485 --> 32:44.921
Run!

32:46.789 --> 32:49.509
Kill as many of them as you can.

32:51.627 --> 32:53.294
Aagh!

32:56.498 --> 32:58.534
Aah!

32:58.535 --> 32:59.967
Raah!

33:12.849 --> 33:15.150
Aah!

33:15.151 --> 33:17.719
I'm sorry, mate, but
I'm a bit famished.

33:17.720 --> 33:20.248
No. No! Aah!

33:22.691 --> 33:24.493
Raagh!

33:24.494 --> 33:26.161
Arr...

33:26.162 --> 33:28.897
Oh...

33:28.898 --> 33:30.098
Uh...

33:30.099 --> 33:32.400
Ha! You look awful.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.679
Why aren't I healing?

33:34.845 --> 33:36.348
What have you done to me?

33:36.514 --> 33:39.207
You were the one that
wanted me to cast the spell.

33:39.208 --> 33:44.230
So I made your stones by linking
their power to your blood,

33:44.814 --> 33:47.349
and now each full moon
whenever a werewolf

33:47.350 --> 33:49.050
uses their power to keep from turning,

33:49.051 --> 33:53.053
they will be drawing from your
strength and causing you pain.

33:53.055 --> 33:56.242
After all I offered you,
you will betray me?

34:00.161 --> 34:03.732
Look me in the eyes, Nik.

34:03.733 --> 34:08.880
Were you ever planning to give
me your mother's grimoire?

34:09.045 --> 34:12.926
Did you care about me,
even for a moment?

34:16.377 --> 34:18.723
I suppose you'll never know.

34:27.188 --> 34:30.318
Francesca kept her end of the deal.

34:30.484 --> 34:33.862
There is, after all,
honor among thieves,

34:34.029 --> 34:38.909
even if they are werewolves, and
as for you, the great irony is,

34:39.076 --> 34:42.570
in wanting to take the city,
you've lost everything...

34:42.571 --> 34:46.751
Your sister Rebekah,
your adopted son Marcel...

34:46.917 --> 34:50.978
And now even your child
and her mother will suffer,

34:50.978 --> 34:53.132
all because of your greed.

34:53.299 --> 34:55.614
Raah! Aagh!

34:55.617 --> 34:58.218
I will kill you.

34:58.220 --> 35:02.058
As weak as you are?
Doubtful.

35:04.059 --> 35:06.426
Aah!

35:12.755 --> 35:16.191
Josh, please drink this.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.415
Oh, man.

35:25.581 --> 35:29.204
Just hang on, please.

35:33.756 --> 35:35.644
No!

35:37.346 --> 35:39.095
Surely, you're not surprised.

35:39.261 --> 35:43.685
Deep down, you knew Niklaus
would leave Joshua to die.

35:43.687 --> 35:45.852
Why are you still here?

35:46.018 --> 35:50.692
I haven't much time left, but
then, neither does your friend.

35:52.858 --> 35:55.612
I can heal him.
I'll find a way.

35:55.778 --> 35:59.741
Even if you could, how long
till it happens again?

35:59.907 --> 36:01.670
As long as Niklaus
remains in New Orleans,

36:01.671 --> 36:05.413
you and your loved ones will
continue to suffer his torment.

36:05.909 --> 36:10.668
I am the only man in history who's
been able to drive him off,

36:10.834 --> 36:13.481
to bring him fear and pain.

36:13.483 --> 36:17.550
If your friend needs
Klaus' blood to survive,

36:17.716 --> 36:22.857
I've been known to spill
a fair share of it.

36:23.430 --> 36:25.558
You'll help me save Josh?

36:25.724 --> 36:31.200
I do have personal reasons for
wanting Niklaus to suffer,

36:31.201 --> 36:36.236
but, yes, I'd like nothing
more than you help you.

36:36.773 --> 36:39.208
And all I have to do
is raise you from the dead.

36:39.209 --> 36:41.324
A small price to pay
to cure your friend

36:41.490 --> 36:43.493
and live a life free of a monster.

36:43.980 --> 36:46.579
Think, Davina.

36:46.745 --> 36:50.185
There still exists a weapon
that can kill Klaus.

36:50.186 --> 36:55.624
Bring back the one being who
has the strength to use it.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.566
Who were you talking to?

37:07.433 --> 37:10.504
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna fix you.

37:27.036 --> 37:29.747
It's done.

37:29.913 --> 37:31.592
A deal is a deal.

37:34.295 --> 37:40.267
You said the bombing was gonna
be minor, no casualties.

37:40.269 --> 37:43.052
All I wanted to do was rally the
crescents against the vampires.

37:43.218 --> 37:45.340
And isn't that exactly what happened?

37:45.341 --> 37:48.943
People died...
My people, my pack!

37:48.944 --> 37:50.978
Your pack?

37:51.560 --> 37:53.414
That's funny...

37:53.415 --> 37:54.849
Because it looked to me
like they were ready

37:54.850 --> 37:59.444
to follow Hayley,
but now, thanks to me,

37:59.610 --> 38:04.325
we have control of the very
thing that will inspire loyalty

38:04.326 --> 38:08.195
from both the crescents
and the Guerreras...

38:09.828 --> 38:14.125
The means to make our
people even more powerful.

38:14.291 --> 38:19.507
The only thing I had to trade
away was the one person

38:19.508 --> 38:22.509
who could've challenged us.

38:24.843 --> 38:27.948
Poor Hayley.
It is a shame.

38:28.430 --> 38:31.976
The witches drive a hard bargain,

38:32.142 --> 38:35.255
but every revolution
requires sacrifice.

38:36.524 --> 38:38.993
This city will belong
to the wolves again.

38:38.994 --> 38:42.320
All we have to do...

38:42.486 --> 38:44.597
Is take it.

39:14.261 --> 39:19.599
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no.

39:22.734 --> 39:26.273
No. No. No. No.

39:26.274 --> 39:28.908
No. No, no, no!

39:28.910 --> 39:31.869
Marcel...

39:32.035 --> 39:33.245
Marcel, I'm sorry.

39:38.218 --> 39:42.588
Uh. Uh! Uh! Uh...

39:44.424 --> 39:48.929
Oh, my God, Marcel, I've been
trying to find someone, anyone.

39:48.930 --> 39:50.464
What's happening?

39:50.465 --> 39:52.032
You need to get out of here.

39:52.033 --> 39:53.566
My guys have been bitten by wolves.

39:53.568 --> 39:57.037
They'll get sick and then blood-crazy.

39:57.038 --> 40:00.941
We need to find Klaus.
His blood can heal you.

40:00.942 --> 40:03.142
Marcel!
Where is she?

40:05.745 --> 40:07.030
Where's Hayley?

40:07.196 --> 40:09.115
He doesn't have her.
Please.

40:09.116 --> 40:11.701
I know you don't trust him,
but you know I wouldn't lie.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.486
He doesn't have her.

40:13.487 --> 40:16.188
Someone does.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.210
Where's my brother?

40:21.729 --> 40:24.364
I left him in the street.

40:24.365 --> 40:26.432
He was gonna kill me,

40:26.433 --> 40:29.835
and then he got jacked up
by some witch's spell.

40:32.105 --> 40:34.340
Genevieve.

40:34.341 --> 40:36.042
Please, no.

40:40.014 --> 40:41.414
Get her down on the floor.

40:41.415 --> 40:42.782
We should take her
to the city of the dead.

40:42.783 --> 40:44.567
We won't make it.
The baby is coming now.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.277
No.
It's too soon.

40:46.443 --> 40:48.287
Aah!
Apparently not.

40:48.288 --> 40:50.189
The plan was to induce her
when the sacrifice was ready.

40:50.190 --> 40:53.326
I had to subdue her, and the trauma
caused a placental abruption.

40:53.327 --> 40:55.762
So the baby is coming, and
we'll just have to adapt.

40:55.763 --> 40:57.163
Oh, let me go!

40:57.329 --> 40:59.707
You need to be calm, Hayley.

40:59.873 --> 41:01.566
Why are you doing this to me?

41:03.126 --> 41:05.471
To be reborn, we must sacrifice.

41:05.472 --> 41:07.340
What the hell does that mean,
you psychotic, little bitch?

41:07.341 --> 41:10.843
The ancestors demand an
offering in exchange for power.

41:10.844 --> 41:13.379
And you child will be a fine offering.

41:13.380 --> 41:15.598
No. No.

41:15.764 --> 41:19.185
You will not take my baby.
I will kill all of you.

41:19.351 --> 41:22.488
No, you won't, and neither
will Klaus or Elijah.

41:22.489 --> 41:23.889
When your baby is born,

41:23.890 --> 41:25.983
we will offer it up to
those who came before us.

41:27.442 --> 41:31.497
I'm sorry, Hayley, but this
is the way it had to be.

41:31.498 --> 41:35.034
No. No!

41:35.200 --> 41:38.337
No! No!

41:38.338 --> 41:40.873
Aah! Arrgh!

41:49.448 --> 41:53.594
Raagh!
