03:01.234 --> 03:04.069
To be exact, the dismembered
body parts of Joseph Purl

03:04.137 --> 03:06.571
were found in the woods outside
of Rapid City, South Dakota.

03:06.639 --> 03:08.673
Local P.D. believes his body
had been there about a week

03:08.741 --> 03:11.175
before a hiker found them,
but he's not the first victim.

is Raymond Nava,

03:25.590 --> 03:27.090

03:27.158 --> 03:29.560
He was a seasonal truck driver
for a logging company.

03:29.627 --> 03:32.128
His dismembered body
was found within the border

03:32.196 --> 03:34.331

the Bureau investigation

Would you call that a slam

03:56.886 --> 03:58.353

03:58.420 --> 04:00.355
Well, Peltier did
kill two FBI agents

for a robbery suspect.

04:01.891 --> 04:03.191
It's hard to forget.

04:03.258 --> 04:06.661
So, what do we know
about these cases.

04:06.729 --> 04:07.764
Well, we know that two bodies

04:07.789 --> 04:09.364
were found within a hour's
drive of each other.

04:09.365 --> 04:12.199
We know there's no evidence
of robbery or sexual assault.

04:12.266 --> 04:14.201
And according
to the decomp reports,

04:14.268 --> 04:17.036
Nava was killed two weeks
before his body was found.

04:17.105 --> 04:19.305
So, the disposal sites
are remote,

04:19.374 --> 04:22.376
and/or the unsub is very
good at hiding the parts.

04:22.443 --> 04:25.045
Oh, the, uh, parts

04:25.113 --> 04:27.279
were dispersed
within a quarter-mile radius,

04:27.347 --> 04:29.382
and it's unclear whether
the unsub did that

04:29.449 --> 04:30.884
or it was scattered
by animals.

04:30.951 --> 04:34.654
Then the bites and scratches
on Purl could be scavenger activity.

04:34.722 --> 04:36.923
Yeah, but if animals
had access,

04:38.959 --> 04:39.926
Eew.

04:39.994 --> 04:41.527
Good question. My guess
is that there was

04:41.594 --> 04:43.729

that probably repelled them.

04:43.796 --> 04:46.665

too wide.

04:53.072 --> 04:54.439

M.E. report.

a lot here on either case.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.143
Thanks.

11:24.210 --> 11:28.314
A wise man would avoid
the Badlands today.

11:28.381 --> 11:29.881
Storm's rolling in.

11:29.949 --> 11:32.417
Right.

11:33.319 --> 11:34.753
[Dishes clatter]

11:34.821 --> 11:35.687
Jeez.

11:35.755 --> 11:36.755
You're a little jumpy.

11:36.823 --> 11:39.558
That guy was just
giving me the creeps.

11:39.625 --> 11:41.626
Sometimes this whole place
gives me the creeps.

11:41.694 --> 11:42.627
You've only been here
a month.

11:42.695 --> 11:44.496
You'll learn to ignore it.

11:44.564 --> 11:46.229
By the way,
the VIP isn't famous.

11:46.297 --> 11:48.065
He's just a friend of Tess'.

11:48.132 --> 11:48.769
I told you.

11:48.770 --> 11:50.563
I thought she was married
to some invalid.

11:50.588 --> 11:51.397
She is.

11:51.398 --> 11:54.767
I wonder if her hot friend
is just a friend?

11:54.834 --> 11:55.601
What?

11:55.669 --> 11:56.969
I'm just sayin'.

11:57.037 --> 11:58.003
Follow my lead.

11:58.072 --> 11:59.772
As long as
the checks clear,

11:59.839 --> 12:02.107
just ignore everything
around here.

12:07.965 --> 12:09.499
C.O.D. was solanine
poisoning.

12:09.567 --> 12:12.507
It was used to control the victims
while they were being held captive.

12:12.508 --> 12:14.810
Solanine is a potent toxin
and hallucinogen.

12:14.878 --> 12:16.712
It comes from a black
nightshade plant.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.980
The unripe berries were used
in the middle ages for torture.

12:19.047 --> 12:20.948
The effect it has
is like a bad acid trip.

12:21.016 --> 12:23.851
That's not fun.
Trust me.

12:25.220 --> 12:28.155
More recently it's been used
in small doses for asthma.

12:28.223 --> 12:30.124
Are we looking for someone
in the medical community?

12:30.191 --> 12:31.726
More like an herbalist
or a shaman

12:31.793 --> 12:33.460
versus a traditional M.D.

12:33.528 --> 12:35.662
The M.E. said the circular
marks were premortem

12:35.730 --> 12:37.831
and the victims were held
around 48 hours.

12:37.899 --> 12:39.265
This could be about torture.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.966
If it is,
the unsub's a sadist,

12:41.034 --> 12:43.802
or he wanted something
from the victims.

12:43.870 --> 12:46.138
Joseph Purl's body parts
were left near a wolf's den.

12:46.205 --> 12:48.774
Petitions to protect the wolf habitat
have been circulating recently.

12:48.842 --> 12:50.409
Garcia's reviewing those names.

12:50.476 --> 12:53.178
It may be an animal activist who's
taken his beliefs to the extreme.

12:53.246 --> 12:56.614
It could be native American,
given the first disposal site.

12:56.682 --> 12:59.784
The circular marks on
Joseph Purl seem almost ritualistic.

12:59.852 --> 13:01.653
Any chance this is part
of a tribal tradition?

13:01.687 --> 13:03.287
Lakota shamans
are well known

13:03.355 --> 13:05.623
for their extended
rituals in healing,

13:05.691 --> 13:07.058
as well as herbal remedies.

13:07.125 --> 13:08.626
One thing
doesn't make sense.

13:08.694 --> 13:10.628
It took a while
to find these victims.

13:10.696 --> 13:13.196
If the unsub wanted to send
a message to the logging industry,

13:13.264 --> 13:15.184
why hide them?
Why not leave them out in the open

13:15.199 --> 13:16.366
for the world to see?

13:16.434 --> 13:19.770
[Knocking on door]

13:21.873 --> 13:23.707
Did you miss me?

13:23.775 --> 13:26.109
What do you think?
Come in.

13:32.282 --> 13:33.315
Oh...

13:33.383 --> 13:34.349
Whoo.

13:34.417 --> 13:35.818
Sorry, uh...

13:35.886 --> 13:38.420
Man, I must be coming down
with something.

13:38.488 --> 13:41.190
I've been kind of
feeling woozy all day.

13:41.257 --> 13:43.459
Oh, no.

13:43.526 --> 13:46.828
Well, lucky for you,
I'm a naturopathic healer.

13:46.896 --> 13:49.898
I know just the thing
for you.

14:01.610 --> 14:02.610
Hey.

14:02.677 --> 14:05.145
Good morning.

14:05.213 --> 14:07.481
How are you feeling?

14:07.548 --> 14:08.616
Better.

14:08.683 --> 14:12.219
That treatment you gave me,
it worked wonders.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.855
And what we did afterwards
wasn't too bad either.

14:14.923 --> 14:17.056
Here, drink this.

14:17.124 --> 14:20.159
It'll help get
all the toxins out.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.765
Your ex-boyfriend do that?

14:27.001 --> 14:29.568
You know, if you're
so scared of him,

14:29.637 --> 14:31.937
then why don't you
just move away?

14:32.005 --> 14:34.172
My little boy
is buried here.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.508
I can't leave him.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.815
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.619
I gotta get moving today.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.319
I'm meeting a friend
of mine.

14:49.387 --> 14:50.688
Don't!

14:50.756 --> 14:52.890
I have sensitivity
to light.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.925
Please close the curtains.

14:59.297 --> 15:01.598
I have an autoimmune
disorder.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.300
My own body is
attacking my eyes.

15:05.836 --> 15:09.105
Well, uh...are you getting
treatment for it, or...

15:09.173 --> 15:10.606
Herbal remedies help,

15:10.675 --> 15:12.375
but I deserve the pain.

15:12.442 --> 15:14.410
Why do you say that?

15:14.478 --> 15:19.715
It started after Adam,
my little boy, died.

15:21.851 --> 15:25.287
We should have saved him.

15:27.323 --> 15:29.958
You know it was our fault.

15:52.793 --> 15:55.662
The company hasn't had
any direct threats recently.

15:55.729 --> 15:58.598
A coworker of Raymond Nava
said the guys usually partied

15:58.666 --> 16:00.434
at a different work camp
every night,

16:00.501 --> 16:02.035
depending on who had
the moonshine.

16:02.103 --> 16:03.836
Were there outsiders
at these parties?

16:03.904 --> 16:05.505
They had an open-door
policy.

16:05.573 --> 16:06.906
Apparently things got
pretty wild.

16:06.974 --> 16:08.607
[Cell phone rings]

16:08.675 --> 16:11.343
Hey, mama. Tell me
something I don't know.

16:11.411 --> 16:14.313
Oh, hot chocolate,
the things I could spill to you...

16:14.381 --> 16:16.848
Hey, hey,
you're on speaker.

16:16.916 --> 16:20.919
That would help you
solve this case.

16:20.987 --> 16:23.488
I have scoured all of my
Lakota shaman sources

16:23.556 --> 16:25.290
and there isn't a single
healing ritual

16:25.357 --> 16:27.392
that would cause those
circular marks to appear.

16:27.460 --> 16:29.940
What about the petitions
the animal activists were circulating?

16:29.995 --> 16:31.995
Yes, I checked and double-checked
and cross-checked

16:32.030 --> 16:33.898
all the names
and all the checks cleared.

16:33.966 --> 16:36.601
What about that list of herbalists
and naturopaths in the area?

16:36.668 --> 16:38.769
Yeah, and give me a raise,
'cause I found the one guy

16:38.837 --> 16:41.472
who was charged with solanine
poisoning, and it was 7 years ago.

16:41.539 --> 16:44.074
I'm sending you his name
and address now. There it is.

16:44.142 --> 16:47.010
All right, Blake and I
will check it out. Thanks, Garcia.

16:48.546 --> 16:52.449
We have a missing man who fits
the same physical description

16:52.517 --> 16:54.451
as the other two victims.

16:57.154 --> 16:59.098
Chad Dumont's 33.

16:59.123 --> 17:01.923
He's an Air Force captain
from Ohio, here on leave.

17:01.924 --> 17:03.926
Well, he's not a logger.
That changes things.

17:03.994 --> 17:06.329
This can't be about
animal activists and territory.

17:06.396 --> 17:08.631
And there's probably no connection
to the native American community,

17:08.698 --> 17:10.633
though someone wants us
to believe that there is.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.704
His voicemail message
to his best friend was

17:12.730 --> 17:14.269
his last known contact.

17:14.270 --> 17:17.905
Hey, man, don't forget,
Devil's Tower on Sunday.

17:17.973 --> 17:20.808
And I'll pick you up 0900.
Better be ready.

17:20.876 --> 17:22.577
His friend said he never showed.

17:22.645 --> 17:24.311
Since he was military,
Dumont always punctual.

17:24.380 --> 17:26.281
Do we know
where he was staying?

17:26.348 --> 17:27.848
Gantry Motel,
according to his friend,

17:27.915 --> 17:30.636
but the thing is, he checked out
the same night he left that message.

17:30.685 --> 17:32.019
Can you play
the message again?

17:32.086 --> 17:34.054
Yeah.

17:34.122 --> 17:37.191
Hey, man, don't forget,
Devil's Tower on Sunday.

17:37.259 --> 17:38.959
[Clang]
Is that a bell?

17:39.027 --> 17:40.761
...better be ready.

17:40.828 --> 17:42.596
It sounds like
they're in a bar.

17:42.664 --> 17:44.664
Dooley's on Fifth
rings a bell

17:44.731 --> 17:46.166
whenever somebody
leaves a big tip.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.268
Woman:
Yeah, I talked to him.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.669
He wasn't interested then.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.272
What can I say? Some guys
have bad taste.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.541
Undoubtedly.

17:54.608 --> 17:57.877
Did you happen to see where
he went after you spoke to him?

17:57.944 --> 18:00.046
I assume he left.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.347
How long are you
in town for?

18:02.415 --> 18:06.118
Uh...not long enough,
I'm afraid.

18:06.186 --> 18:09.221
Too bad. We could
have had some fun.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.424
Who was that?

18:12.492 --> 18:15.561
That was the fourth
Mrs. Rossi if I'm not careful.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.229
She hit on Chad
when he was here,

18:18.297 --> 18:19.564
but he turned her down.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.966
Well, I just got off the phone
with Chad's sister.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.401
He was a real stand-up guy.

18:23.468 --> 18:25.870
He took care of his family
after their father died.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.673
He got promoted quickly
in the Air Force.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.975
Well, we know he checked out
of the motel after he left the bar,

18:31.043 --> 18:32.445
even though he had
the room reserved

18:32.470 --> 18:33.666
for two more nights.

18:34.545 --> 18:37.447
Now, that only makes sense
if he met someone here.

18:37.515 --> 18:40.350
Hmm. Well, if that's
not his type, who is?

18:40.418 --> 18:41.852
A guy?

18:41.920 --> 18:44.822
If he was gay, his family and
best friend would know about it.

18:44.889 --> 18:46.857
And don't forget about
the use of poison.

18:46.925 --> 18:49.859
So, the unsub is a woman.

18:49.927 --> 18:54.030
His ideal would be
not too aggressive,

18:54.098 --> 18:55.832
less flashy.

18:55.899 --> 18:57.666
Demure.

18:57.735 --> 18:59.902
Given his family history
and career choice,

18:59.970 --> 19:02.038
he's comfortable
in the protective role.

19:02.106 --> 19:04.472
What if someone appealed
to those instincts?

19:04.540 --> 19:08.576
That means we're looking
for a damsel in distress.

19:08.644 --> 19:10.879
It was a mistake.
I made solanine

19:10.947 --> 19:14.149
for someone who asked for
an organic pesticide.

19:14.217 --> 19:16.462
I had absolutely no idea
that he planned to murder

19:16.487 --> 19:17.886
his neighbor's dog with it.

19:17.887 --> 19:19.487
And you never
made it again?

19:19.555 --> 19:22.089
I learned my lesson.
Paid my fine, did my time.

19:22.157 --> 19:23.824
Are there other naturopaths
in this area?

19:23.892 --> 19:25.893
Only 3 who really knew herbs.

19:25.961 --> 19:27.082
Can you tell us
who they are?

19:27.128 --> 19:28.828
No problem.

19:35.936 --> 19:37.904
Excuse me.

19:37.972 --> 19:39.239
Yeah.

19:39.306 --> 19:40.506
Could I see one of the cups

19:40.574 --> 19:41.908
you use for this therapy?

19:41.976 --> 19:43.408
Sure.

19:48.915 --> 19:51.063
You think this is what
caused those marks

19:51.088 --> 19:52.251
on Joseph Purl's back?

19:52.252 --> 19:53.726
The cup's the right diameter.

19:53.751 --> 19:55.580
It's wider than what
I've seen before.

19:55.855 --> 19:58.823
You know, the victims have
the same coloring and build.

19:59.724 --> 20:02.193
Is this all about fertility?

20:02.261 --> 20:03.795
We believe that the unsub
that we're looking for

20:03.862 --> 20:05.562
is a woman who's trying
to get pregnant.

20:05.630 --> 20:08.232
She's experiencing what we call
black widow maternal desire.

20:08.300 --> 20:09.767
She has a desperate
need for a child,

20:09.835 --> 20:12.469
which most likely stems
from the recent loss of one.

20:12.537 --> 20:13.642
That child may have died

20:13.667 --> 20:15.736
or been taken away
in a custody situation.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.374
She's drugging
her male victims

20:17.442 --> 20:20.010
in order to keep them
under her control for 48 hours,

20:20.077 --> 20:21.912
and we believe she's using
them as breeding partners

20:21.979 --> 20:24.648
to help replace the child
that she lost.

20:24.716 --> 20:27.484
Her victims are surrogates
for a male figure in her life,

20:27.552 --> 20:29.520
one she may have already killed.

20:29.587 --> 20:31.487
He could be a boyfriend
or husband

20:31.555 --> 20:33.989
who most likely fathered
the child she lost.

20:34.057 --> 20:36.125
And the signs of torture
indicate that she may blame

20:36.193 --> 20:37.593
the child's father
for this loss

20:37.661 --> 20:39.995
and is exacting her revenge
on these victims.

20:40.063 --> 20:41.144
Blake: After they are dead,

20:41.148 --> 20:43.264
she dismembers them
for easier disposal.

20:43.265 --> 20:46.168
The strength required to do this and
transport body parts,

20:46.236 --> 20:49.204
it's likely that she's working with
a submissive partner

20:49.271 --> 20:51.105
she dominates
with her agenda.

20:51.173 --> 20:54.409
Based on the sophistication
and patience required for these crimes,

20:54.477 --> 20:57.813
we believe this unsub
is probably in her 30s

20:57.880 --> 20:59.581
and no older than
her early 40s

20:59.649 --> 21:01.149
if pregnancy is her goal.

21:01.217 --> 21:02.884
And she works at night,

21:02.952 --> 21:05.486
luring victims
from parties or bars.

21:05.554 --> 21:07.973
She may even have
an illness or feign one

21:07.998 --> 21:09.657
to gain their sympathy.

21:09.658 --> 21:11.826
Jack Dumont's been missing
for almost 30 hours,

21:11.893 --> 21:14.829
and if the unsub keeps to her
schedule, he may still be alive.

21:14.896 --> 21:16.530
But time is of the essence.

21:16.598 --> 21:17.865
Even though the first two
victims are dead,

21:17.932 --> 21:19.599
we can certainly
step up our game

21:19.667 --> 21:23.035
so we can give the victims'
families some answers.

21:24.438 --> 21:26.973
Thank you.

21:29.209 --> 21:31.110
Something weird's going on.

21:31.178 --> 21:33.179
I heard sounds
in room 209.

21:33.247 --> 21:34.146
So?

21:34.214 --> 21:36.047
It's supposed
to be empty.

21:36.115 --> 21:37.649
Do you know anything
about it?

21:37.717 --> 21:38.950
No.

21:39.018 --> 21:40.652
Oh, my God, you do.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.821
Is this place haunted?

21:42.889 --> 21:45.123
Don't know and don't care,

21:45.191 --> 21:47.058
as long as I'm left alone.

21:47.126 --> 21:49.194
Tess' friend didn't
come down for breakfast.

21:49.262 --> 21:51.029
Maybe it's connected
to him.

21:51.097 --> 21:52.963
He checked out last night.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.869
[Labored breathing]

22:20.324 --> 22:22.426
Hey.

22:30.099 --> 22:31.867
[Whispering]
Come get me.

22:47.716 --> 22:50.251
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

22:50.319 --> 22:52.954
[Gasping]

22:55.623 --> 22:57.891
[Grunting]

23:10.672 --> 23:14.874
Did I ever tell you
about my Uncle Sal?

23:14.942 --> 23:18.277
He liked to fix up
old cars.

23:18.345 --> 23:21.614
When my Aunt Rosie died,
he bought a 1947 Buick.

23:21.682 --> 23:23.916
Well, it was a piece
of junk, really,

23:23.984 --> 23:25.751
but he was obsessed
with it.

23:25.819 --> 23:28.386
He'd work on it
day and night,

23:28.454 --> 23:29.888
forgetting to eat,

23:29.956 --> 23:34.526
until it was
a thing of beauty.

23:34.594 --> 23:38.029
Then one day,
it got stolen.

23:38.097 --> 23:40.532
When the cops found it,

23:40.600 --> 23:43.601
it had been completely
vandalized.

23:43.668 --> 23:46.704
Uncle Sal was devastated.

23:46.771 --> 23:48.873
Never recovered.

23:50.441 --> 23:53.544
He died about a year later.

23:54.546 --> 23:56.814
I'm sorry about your Uncle.

23:56.882 --> 24:00.016
I’m sorry about Maeve.

24:01.519 --> 24:05.054
So how long has it been
now, 4 months?

24:05.122 --> 24:08.024
3 months and 15 days.

24:08.091 --> 24:10.393
That's why
you're not sleeping.

24:10.460 --> 24:13.630
This can't go on.

24:13.697 --> 24:16.899
I realize that the socially
acceptable amount of time

24:16.966 --> 24:20.168
to wallow in grief
is coming to an end, and--

24:20.236 --> 24:21.670
That's not what I mean.

24:21.738 --> 24:24.406
You wallow as long
as you need,

24:24.473 --> 24:27.375
but talk to someone.

24:30.079 --> 24:33.180
I feel like there are
two types of people

24:33.248 --> 24:35.349
in this world, Rossi.

24:35.417 --> 24:38.019
The ones that get over
their grief and move on

24:38.086 --> 24:43.691
and the ones that descend
into some sort off endless misery.

24:43.759 --> 24:45.192
I know how you feel.

24:45.260 --> 24:47.461
Give it time.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.529
How much time?

24:49.597 --> 24:53.633
I thought by coming
to work every day

24:53.701 --> 24:57.136
and helping other people,
the pain would lessen, but it hasn't.

24:57.204 --> 25:00.740
Compartmentalization
works only so long.

25:00.808 --> 25:03.576
Don't be like Uncle Sal.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.072
You know that I remember
every single word

25:09.097 --> 25:10.749
we ever said to each other?

25:10.750 --> 25:12.217
[Sighs]

25:12.285 --> 25:16.589
Finally, the downside
to an eidetic memory.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.325
Listen...

25:21.393 --> 25:23.260
Spencer...

25:23.328 --> 25:25.730
If you want
to feel better,

25:25.798 --> 25:28.733
you can't control
the process.

25:28.801 --> 25:31.936
You have to let
yourself grieve.

25:33.505 --> 25:37.140
I'm not sleeping
because when--when I do,

25:37.208 --> 25:39.743
I dream of Maeve.

25:39.811 --> 25:44.848
And when I see her,
I feel the sweetest relief imaginable.

25:44.916 --> 25:46.850
She always asks me to dance,

25:46.918 --> 25:52.387
but I can't because
I don't know how to dance,

25:52.455 --> 25:55.099
and because I never even
got to touch her

25:55.124 --> 25:56.972
when she was alive.

25:58.361 --> 26:02.031
I know if I get into
that fantasy, I'll be lost forever,

26:02.099 --> 26:05.434
so I force myself
to wake up.

26:08.671 --> 26:11.372
Is that part
of normal healing?

26:18.814 --> 26:22.651
Ok, so let's not forget
that all of the men,

26:22.718 --> 26:25.152
including the latest,
were from out of town.

26:25.219 --> 26:27.287
They all lived in
temporary spaces,

26:27.355 --> 26:28.822
none of which
were the Ritz.

26:28.890 --> 26:32.492
If the unsub lured these men away
with a promise of sex,

26:32.560 --> 26:34.094
they probably went
to her place.

26:34.162 --> 26:35.996
But Chad Dumont
checked out of his motel.

26:36.064 --> 26:37.802
I mean, how many guys
would do that first

26:37.827 --> 26:39.166
before a one-night stand?

26:39.167 --> 26:40.833
Almost none. They'd want
a place to retreat to.

26:40.901 --> 26:43.335
All right, well, what if
she offered them something

26:43.403 --> 26:45.672
other than
or in addition to sex,

26:45.739 --> 26:47.040
like another hotel room?

26:47.107 --> 26:48.468
Yeah, this town caters
to tourists,

26:48.508 --> 26:50.276
so there's no shortage
of lodging.

26:50.343 --> 26:53.512
So we may be looking for a woman
who owns or works at a hotel.

26:53.580 --> 26:55.548
[Vacuum cleaner running]

28:05.748 --> 28:07.348
Aah!

28:18.550 --> 28:20.083
No I.D. on her yet.

28:20.151 --> 28:21.818
Prints aren't
in the system,

28:21.886 --> 28:23.590
and no one matching
her description has

28:23.615 --> 28:25.522
been reported missing.

28:25.523 --> 28:27.990
The body parts are pretty
close together this time.

28:28.058 --> 28:30.326
The unsub was in a hurry
or didn't make an effort

28:30.394 --> 28:31.994
to spread them out
like she did before.

28:32.062 --> 28:33.796
Plus the M.O.'s
different.

28:33.864 --> 28:36.432
Female victim without mutilation
or circular marks.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.468
Well, it can't be an evolution.
She wouldn't go

28:38.535 --> 28:41.003
from large men who are
difficult targets to an easier one.

28:41.071 --> 28:42.572
Maybe this victim
just got in the way.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.173
That would explain the lack
of ritual markings.

28:45.241 --> 28:47.942
She didn't generate the same
emotional response in the unsub.

28:48.010 --> 28:50.011
Maybe her partner
did this one alone.

28:50.079 --> 28:52.881
Not hiding the body as long means
it's someone less detail oriented.

28:52.948 --> 28:55.083
I'd say the partner's a male.

28:55.151 --> 28:57.018
Any chance
that this is the unsub?

28:57.086 --> 28:59.520
No, no.
She's way too young.

28:59.588 --> 29:01.756
But we're definitely looking
for a male/female couple.

29:12.021 --> 29:13.567
internally without the FBI.

29:13.568 --> 29:14.968
Did you find something?

29:15.036 --> 29:16.636
12 years ago, a non-native
was given permission

29:16.704 --> 29:17.778
to stay on the reservation

29:17.803 --> 29:19.946
to study medicinal herbs
with an old shaman.

29:20.408 --> 29:21.874
He was kicked out
when they suspected

29:21.942 --> 29:24.611
he was trying to poison
another student with solanine.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.479
What was his name?
Roger Whitcomb.

29:26.547 --> 29:28.515

anymore for him in the area.

You said the unsub's
partner is probably

31:01.320 --> 31:02.928
a boyfriend or husband.

31:03.538 --> 31:06.206
So is he catching her
sleeping with other men

31:06.274 --> 31:08.007
and tortures and kills them
out of jealousy?

31:08.074 --> 31:09.275
I buy that
happening once,

31:09.342 --> 31:11.611
but anything beyond
that, she's complicit.

31:11.678 --> 31:14.280

pathological grief at work.

31:15.783 --> 31:16.823
What have you got, Garcia?

31:16.884 --> 31:18.885
I got a whole lot of nothing
on Roger Whitcomb.

31:18.952 --> 31:20.154
It's like he must have left
the area,

31:20.179 --> 31:21.888
'cause there's
zilch after aught-1.

31:21.889 --> 31:25.189
Secondly, there are 82 hotels,

who've lost children?

Yeah, there's two of them,
but there's nothing hinky.

There is, however, one woman
with a deceased child

She's 38. Her 5-year-old
son Adam died 3 years ago.

And our first victim
was killed the very same week

of her son's death.

do we know about Tess?

We know that the father
of her dead son is Steven Colson.

He's an ex-boyfriend,
an abusive one at that,

32:41.847 --> 32:43.280
based on a police report.

He left her after their son died
and he moved to Florida.

32:46.017 --> 32:47.451
According to an article,
he and Tess

32:47.519 --> 32:49.655
were having a lakeside
picnic with their son,

32:49.656 --> 32:50.492
they got in an argument,

32:50.517 --> 32:52.021
they didn't notice that

Whitcomb disappeared.

33:29.991 --> 33:31.480
Disposing of the first
victim on the reservation

33:31.505 --> 33:32.527
may have been payback.

33:32.528 --> 33:34.361
If he murdered someone there
12 years ago,

33:34.430 --> 33:36.063
he's not the submissive partner
in the relationship.

33:36.131 --> 33:37.298
And he's resourceful enough
to run a hotel,

33:37.365 --> 33:39.499
which means he can appear
to function normally.

33:39.567 --> 33:41.034
A classic sociopath.

33:41.101 --> 33:42.536
He always had
a murderous impulse.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.137
He took advantage
of Tess' grief

33:44.204 --> 33:46.473

his homicidal fantasies.

and then 10 years ago,

33:51.946 --> 33:53.679
he bought the inn with money
he got from an inheritance.

33:53.747 --> 33:56.649
He still has a website
that he sells his natural remedies on,

33:56.716 --> 34:00.118

he cured himself of prostate cancer.

34:07.794 --> 34:09.795
that without his remedies,
she would be blind.

34:09.862 --> 34:11.330
It could be psychosomatic,

death if it was sunny the day he died.

34:15.306 --> 34:16.801
when she sought treatment
for her disease.

34:16.802 --> 34:18.803
She didn't become
homicidal till he entered her life.

34:43.494 --> 34:45.661
But Amber was harmless.

34:45.728 --> 34:48.197
Don't be naive.
She would have turned us in.

34:48.264 --> 34:52.735
You never said we would
kill innocent bystanders.

34:54.938 --> 34:57.773
I...

34:57.841 --> 35:00.442
I want to leave now.

35:00.510 --> 35:03.345
Not until you take care
of Steven.

35:07.517 --> 35:08.638
Remember what he did to you.

35:08.684 --> 35:11.487
He's only getting
what he deserves.

35:13.856 --> 35:16.624
I can't do this anymore.

35:16.691 --> 35:19.994
Oh, darling,
that's not the deal we made.

35:20.062 --> 35:22.696
Don't you remember?

35:22.764 --> 35:25.199
You were a wreck
when we met.

35:25.267 --> 35:28.036
No home, no money, no food,

35:28.103 --> 35:30.037
and a dead son to boot.

35:30.104 --> 35:33.407
You were dying
and I saved your life.

35:33.474 --> 35:34.974
I made an honest woman
out of you,

35:35.043 --> 35:37.077
and I took care of you.
Wasn't I generous?

35:37.145 --> 35:38.711
Mm-hmm.

35:38.779 --> 35:39.913
I even allowed you
to take lovers

35:39.980 --> 35:41.248
so you could get
pregnant again.

35:41.315 --> 35:44.918
But you must abide
by the rules.

35:44.985 --> 35:46.532
You must kill your lovers

35:46.557 --> 35:48.613
to protect the sanctity
of our vows.

35:49.156 --> 35:50.789
Didn't you agree to that?

35:50.857 --> 35:54.693
Only because you told me
this would work.

35:54.761 --> 35:57.296
But I'm still not pregnant.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.498
Shh...

35:59.566 --> 36:01.967
You don't know that yet.

36:06.439 --> 36:08.906
Look...

36:10.109 --> 36:12.710
Oh, my God.

36:12.778 --> 36:15.846
Has this all been a lie?

36:15.914 --> 36:17.882
You've been
manipulating me.

36:17.950 --> 36:19.983
You...

36:20.051 --> 36:24.221
You turned me into
a monster.

36:26.591 --> 36:29.293
My poor baby.

36:29.360 --> 36:32.696
He's never coming back.

36:32.763 --> 36:34.263
Oh!

36:34.331 --> 36:36.031
Enough!

36:37.867 --> 36:39.102
Kill him.

36:39.169 --> 36:40.903
Now.

36:40.971 --> 36:43.106
[Grunting]

36:48.778 --> 36:52.814
FBI. Drop the knife.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.717
He slept with my wife.

36:57.153 --> 36:58.653
He's still alive.
We need paramedics

36:58.721 --> 37:00.122
she's not here.

37:00.189 --> 37:01.689
Where's Tess?

37:01.757 --> 37:03.525
A fickle wife

37:03.593 --> 37:06.693
blows like a seed
in the wind.

37:12.667 --> 37:15.236
There's another exit.

37:23.444 --> 37:26.012
Garcia, where did Tess' son die?

37:26.079 --> 37:28.148
Checking now. Uh...

37:28.215 --> 37:31.451
He drowned at Deerfield Lake.
That's an hour outside the city.

37:32.453 --> 37:35.555
[Sirens]

38:11.923 --> 38:14.524
Reid: J.R.R. Tolkien wrote,

38:14.592 --> 38:17.194
"I will not say
do not weep,

38:17.261 --> 38:20.864
for not all tears
are an evil."

38:28.772 --> 38:30.073
It's alchemy.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.274
Hmm?

38:34.277 --> 38:38.748
Alchemy turns common metals
into precious ones.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.483
Dreams work the same way.

38:41.551 --> 38:45.687
Turning something awful
into...

38:45.755 --> 38:47.388
Something better.

38:47.456 --> 38:50.158
I don't know.

38:50.226 --> 38:51.727
I'd like to believe
that, but...

38:51.794 --> 38:52.828
Just think about it.

38:52.895 --> 38:57.232
No. Better yet, don't think.

38:57.299 --> 39:00.534
Just let it happen, Spencer.

39:01.903 --> 39:06.073
I'm gonna get some shuteye.
You should, too.

39:28.729 --> 39:30.963
May I take your order, sir?

39:31.030 --> 39:34.266
Um, I'll have a double
espresso.

39:35.534 --> 39:39.104
And I'll have
a nonfat latte.

39:39.172 --> 39:41.240
Fancy meeting you here.

39:41.307 --> 39:42.241
Hi.

39:42.308 --> 39:44.309
Hi.

39:44.377 --> 39:46.378
Did you know
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

39:46.445 --> 39:48.750
probably sat right here
drinking his coffee

39:48.775 --> 39:50.714
about 130 years ago?

39:50.715 --> 39:52.383
I think he probably
drank tea.

39:52.450 --> 39:54.718
You know, given his comment
that the tea fields of Ceylon

39:54.787 --> 39:58.156
are as true a monument
to courage as is the lion at Waterloo.

39:58.223 --> 39:59.490
Spencer...
And this is Oxford.

39:59.557 --> 40:01.558
Didn't sir Arthur Conan Doyle
go to school

40:01.626 --> 40:03.059
at the University
of Edinburgh?

40:03.127 --> 40:05.162
Are you gonna argue
with everything I say?

40:05.229 --> 40:07.230
No, of course not.

40:07.298 --> 40:10.733
You know, there is such a thing
as too much logic.

40:12.236 --> 40:15.705
[Music plays]

40:20.310 --> 40:22.077
Dance with me.

40:25.115 --> 40:26.581
Why?

40:26.649 --> 40:31.420
I want to hold you once
before I'm a ghost of a memory.
