00:01.020 --> 00:03.921
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:04.022 --> 00:06.514
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:06.625 --> 00:08.616
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.166 --> 00:15.861
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:19.705 --> 00:23.698
<i>Michael Bluth was working
at home when his son made a curious request.</i>

00:23.809 --> 00:26.710
<i>Dad, would anyone miss this
Peter and the Wolf read-along record?</i>

00:26.812 --> 00:29.872
No. I think that's part of
the model home decorations. Why?

00:29.982 --> 00:34.146
You're right. My girlfriend Ann wants
to have a Christian music bonfire here.

00:34.253 --> 00:37.882
That sounds like some mild fun.
I think we've got some Christmas music.

00:37.990 --> 00:42.051
Oh, no. It's not- It's not a "Christian music"
bonfire. It's a Christian "music bonfire."

00:42.161 --> 00:44.220
You know, we burn
all satanic music.

00:44.329 --> 00:47.389
The thing is, though, the only music
I have is either instructional or humor.

00:47.499 --> 00:50.900
<i>He'd been particularly fond
of a CD of something called TheJerky Boys.</i>

00:51.003 --> 00:52.903
Hello.

00:53.005 --> 00:55.974
Hey, nitz. Hey, jerky.
I wanna buy a house, Dad.

00:56.075 --> 00:58.236
- It's gotta be big.
- You said "Dad," buddy.

00:58.343 --> 01:01.471
Shut up, jerky.

01:03.749 --> 01:06.775
<i>Hey, George Michael. Jesus called.
He wants your Thriller album.</i>

01:06.885 --> 01:09.581
<i>Yeah, I don't think the bonfire
is such a great idea.</i>

01:09.688 --> 01:11.918
I know it might be weird,
but Ann's my girlfriend...

01:12.024 --> 01:14.322
so I think I'll go
buy some albums today.

01:14.426 --> 01:16.917
Hey, can you cover for me
at the banana stand if l-

01:18.030 --> 01:20.191
<i>- No.
- I'll cover for you, pal.</i>

01:20.299 --> 01:22.927
It's been a long time since I've been down
at that banana stand.

01:23.035 --> 01:26.801
Oh, okay. Good. It's the only way
we're ever gonna get it air-conditioned.

01:26.905 --> 01:31.103
<i>Michael! How would you like
me to owe you a favor?</i>

01:31.210 --> 01:33.838
I want you to bid on me at
the charity auction this year.

01:33.946 --> 01:36.380
Okay. Now I'd like to use up
my favor and decline.

01:36.482 --> 01:38.541
And isn't that Buster's annual job?

01:38.650 --> 01:41.483
Yes, but I can't have
a replay of last year.

01:41.587 --> 01:45.045
<i>When Buster
inadvertently bid on Lucille 2.</i>

01:45.157 --> 01:48.058
- $10,000!
- Buster.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.391
And you're embarrassed to have Oscar bid on you.

01:51.497 --> 01:53.624
With his two pair
of pants? You bet.

01:53.732 --> 01:57.293
Oh, hi, Mom.
I have the afternoon free.

01:57.402 --> 02:00.030
<i>Really? Did nothing cancel?</i>

02:00.139 --> 02:02.573
All right.
I need to borrow a fur.

02:02.674 --> 02:06.633
I thought you were antifur, Lindsay. Weren't
you protesting some hunter gun thing yesterday?

02:06.745 --> 02:08.804
I stopped by.
I hadn't chosen a side.

02:08.913 --> 02:11.144
...which follows all the rules.
- Murderers! You're all murderers!

02:11.250 --> 02:15.016
<i>There are plenty of rules
about guns already on the books.
- Murderers!</i>

02:15.120 --> 02:17.350
You're not allowed
to sell a gun to a kid.

02:17.456 --> 02:21.187
<i>- You're not even allowed
to fire your gun in the air-
- Is that Frank Wrench?</i>

02:21.293 --> 02:23.056
On the Fourth ofJuly.

02:23.162 --> 02:26.996
<i>In fact, it was People's Choice
nominated actor Moses Taylor...</i>

02:27.099 --> 02:30.364
<i>famous for his portrayal
of the rule-abiding detective-</i>

02:30.469 --> 02:32.266
<i>- Stop sign.
- Frank Wrench...</i>

02:32.371 --> 02:35.670
<i>star of the television show Wrench.</i>

02:35.774 --> 02:38.106
<i>Well, that's one rule
I'm not gonna follow.</i>

02:40.012 --> 02:42.776
- Aah.
- That's the Second Amendment. Read it.

02:42.881 --> 02:44.849
What do you need
with one of Mom's furs?

02:44.950 --> 02:47.510
- I'm cold.
- So am I.

02:47.619 --> 02:49.450
- No.
- All right, look.

02:49.555 --> 02:52.888
I met Moses Taylor. We're having
a date in the park tomorrow.

02:52.991 --> 02:56.449
Try to get him to bid on you at the auction
tomorrow, because Michael can't.

02:56.562 --> 02:58.462
He's bidding on Mother.

02:58.564 --> 03:02.864
Except that I'm not. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go work in the banana stand.

03:02.968 --> 03:06.460
And I'm gonna see if I can get
a wrench to strip my nuts.

03:06.572 --> 03:09.234
I was trying to be sexy.

03:09.341 --> 03:11.309
It just got away from me.

03:11.410 --> 03:16.541
<i>It's bachelorette season in Newport Beach,
and some lovely ladies are up for auction.</i>

03:16.648 --> 03:19.845
<i>Plus, another wolf sighting in the park.
What that means for your weekend-</i>

03:19.952 --> 03:21.852
Bad news, Michael.

03:21.954 --> 03:25.082
I'm afraid the Blue Man Group
and I have parted ways.

03:25.190 --> 03:29.251
Seems I'm officially no longer
a standby understudy.

03:29.361 --> 03:33.161
- "Cease and desist."
- Seems they don't appreciate competition.

03:33.265 --> 03:35.733
<i>Tobias had recently taken out an ad...</i>

03:35.834 --> 03:38.302
<i>in a trade magazine
for a one-man show.</i>

03:38.403 --> 03:42.430
<i>And the worst part is Lindsay's out there
chasing some successful actor.</i>

03:42.541 --> 03:45.009
Television's Frank Wrench.

03:45.110 --> 03:48.841
I need to prove to her that I'm
not just a man, but a man's man.

03:48.947 --> 03:51.074
I think she knows that.

03:51.183 --> 03:54.744
Jesus! It's the wolf! That is
the wolf! The wolf is upstairs!

03:54.853 --> 03:57.185
<i>I think it's just my son's
Peter and the Wolf record.</i>

03:57.289 --> 03:59.917
I thought that was a Homefill.

04:00.025 --> 04:02.619
<i>Michael went
to check on his fugitive father...</i>

04:02.728 --> 04:05.196
<i>- who was living in the attic.
- You heard my call?</i>

04:05.297 --> 04:08.960
Have you been doing that all over town?
Because people think there's a wolf on the loose.

04:09.067 --> 04:12.093
Yes, there is a wolf on the
loose. His name is Oscar.

04:12.204 --> 04:16.435
Tell me he's not gonna be bidding on your
mother at that charity auction with my money.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.509
Is that why you called me
up here, Dad?

04:18.610 --> 04:21.374
Because you are a fugitive, and as far
as she knows, you're in another country.

04:21.480 --> 04:25.280
It's driving me crazy.
They're parading in public.

04:25.384 --> 04:29.184
My back is-is- it's in knots.
I haven't had a massage since prison.

04:29.288 --> 04:31.188
Hope that was forced.

04:31.290 --> 04:34.657
But then I found a way to fix my back
in this old catalog. Look at this hot tub.

04:34.760 --> 04:38.218
I could use it for so many things.
It could be my, you know, water supply.

04:38.330 --> 04:43.131
And those, uh, premade boil-in-bag meals-
You just toss those in there.

04:43.235 --> 04:45.294
- You're not getting a hot tub.
- Come on. Please!

04:45.404 --> 04:48.373
Dad, please. We can't afford that.
We're in this mess because of you.

04:48.473 --> 04:50.964
I'm working at the banana stand
just so we don't lose a shift.

04:51.076 --> 04:53.909
- But-
- We're done pampering ourselves in this family.

04:55.414 --> 04:58.645
Yeah, I would like the biggest
air-conditioner you've got.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.877
No, no, not tomorrow.
I need-

05:00.986 --> 05:02.886
I need it today.
I'm not here tomorrow.

05:02.988 --> 05:05.980
<i>Just then, Michael ran into
a woman whom he hadn't seen in years.</i>

05:06.091 --> 05:09.424
- Michael?
- Sally Sitwell.

05:09.528 --> 05:12.554
<i>Michael had always
been in love with Sally Sitwell.</i>

05:12.664 --> 05:15.633
- We could steal a golf cart.
- No, they keep 'em locked up.

05:15.734 --> 05:18.828
- I know, 'cause I have a key.
- I'll go get my sweater.

05:18.937 --> 05:20.837
Oh, so you wanna use the key.

05:20.939 --> 05:24.238
<i>But his father had
a longtime competition with her father.</i>

05:24.343 --> 05:27.335
It looks like my boy is gonna be
sticking it to your daughter, Sitwell.

05:27.446 --> 05:30.438
<i>Stick it to her.
Stick it to her.</i>

05:30.549 --> 05:32.517
<i>As a result,
Michael was awkward around her.</i>

05:32.617 --> 05:36.018
Should we go or... stick around?

05:36.121 --> 05:39.090
No, we're not gonna be sticking anything.
Not-Not gonna stick a thing.

05:39.191 --> 05:43.025
<i>Since then, he'd always been
eager to show her that he'd become a man.</i>

05:43.128 --> 05:47.087
- Are you still working here?
- No, no, no. Filling in for my son.

05:47.199 --> 05:49.963
<i>Michael, and- Wow.</i>

05:50.068 --> 05:53.629
<i>- Sally Stickwell.
- Right.</i>

05:53.739 --> 05:56.299
Because the guys
wanted to stick it to me.

05:56.408 --> 05:58.205
- What? No.
- I never-

05:58.310 --> 06:00.369
- Michael used to say that.
- No, I didn't.

06:00.479 --> 06:02.572
- You said other stuff.
- I absolutely did not say that.

06:02.681 --> 06:05.479
- Man, he loved you.
- So, Gob, tell me-

06:05.584 --> 06:07.552
are you still doing
your little tricks?

06:07.652 --> 06:10.143
Do you consider this
to be a little trick?

06:10.255 --> 06:13.952
Oh. Did you just
squirt me with something?

06:14.059 --> 06:16.721
It's lighter fluid.
Didn't put in a new flint.

06:16.828 --> 06:20.730
<i>But still, where did
the lighter fluid come from?</i>

06:20.832 --> 06:25.269
- That's- great.
- Michael, maybe I'll see you over at the club.

06:25.370 --> 06:28.168
<i>We never really took
that cart ride, did we?</i>

06:28.273 --> 06:31.640
And we never will,
'cause I'm not there.

06:31.743 --> 06:35.679
- Nor am I here. I mean, I'm here today.
- I'm gonna go.

06:35.781 --> 06:38.011
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:39.117 --> 06:41.585
Smooth, Michael...

06:41.686 --> 06:44.917
like her father's head,
chest, arms, legs and ass.

06:45.023 --> 06:48.117
- What are you talkin' about?
- He's hairless, Michael. It's a condition.

06:48.226 --> 06:51.354
I hate the guy, but at least he's got-
Satiny and smooth probably.

06:51.463 --> 06:53.363
I'm just different
than you, Gob.

06:53.465 --> 06:57.424
I'm not gonna siphon gas out of some girl's
car like you used to in high school...

06:57.536 --> 07:00.528
just so you can show up
and say, "Car troubles?"

07:00.639 --> 07:03.335
It's called taking advantage.
It's what gets you ahead in life.

07:03.442 --> 07:06.536
Like you did with our biggest
shareholder, Lucille Austero.

07:06.645 --> 07:08.943
That was a one-time thing,
Michael. It's over.

07:09.047 --> 07:11.709
<i>It was far from over.</i>

07:11.817 --> 07:17.221
- Shall I put the Posturepedic in the down position?
- Elevate the knees this time.

07:17.322 --> 07:20.450
You just let Sally Sitwell slip away
right when she was ready to go.

07:20.559 --> 07:22.527
- You were scared.
- What are you talking about?

07:22.627 --> 07:24.595
Come on.

07:24.696 --> 07:27.392
You gonna get off and do
your little dance too?

07:27.499 --> 07:30.957
No, l-I hurt my ankle yesterday
shooting hoops or something.

07:31.069 --> 07:34.129
Oh, God. My ankle.

07:34.239 --> 07:37.367
- Don't move. Let me-
- No, no, no. It's bad.

07:37.476 --> 07:39.706
<i>- Mother! Mother!
- Buster, it hurts.</i>

07:39.811 --> 07:43.303
<i>Michael decided
that perhaps he should go after Sally.</i>

07:43.415 --> 07:45.474
Have you seen
my other pair of pants?

07:45.584 --> 07:48.246
Lupe washed them, and they
sprouted. I threw them out.

07:48.353 --> 07:50.821
Well, that puts a lot
of pressure on this pair.

07:50.922 --> 07:53.982
<i>I think this one's good.
Looks like it would've put up a fight.</i>

07:54.092 --> 07:57.289
- I put up one to get it.
- As long as it gets Frank Wrench to bid on me.

07:57.395 --> 07:59.295
<i>- It won't.
- Hey, Mom.</i>

07:59.397 --> 08:01.695
I need to borrow
your country club card.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.827
There's a friend I have that has lunch
there often I'd like to run into.

08:05.937 --> 08:07.734
Sounds like you're asking
for a favor.

08:07.839 --> 08:11.969
- I know what that's gonna cost me.
I'm willing to bid on you.
- I'll give you the money.

08:12.077 --> 08:15.535
Start at five grand. If there are
other bidders, back off gracefully.

08:15.647 --> 08:21.108
Shout out, "I get her 364 days
a year for free!" or something.

08:21.219 --> 08:23.187
You're not gonna hear
that phrase.

08:23.288 --> 08:26.621
<i>Soon, Tobias came across
a flyer that promised to improve...</i>

08:26.725 --> 08:30.422
<i>both his masculine self-image
and his financial standing.</i>

08:30.529 --> 08:32.429
They're literally blue, not sad.

08:32.530 --> 08:36.023
<i>Meanwhile, Michael went to
have his accidental encounter with Sally...</i>

08:36.134 --> 08:39.193
<i>- but had forgotten about the
club's dress code for lunch.
- We have a dress code.</i>

08:40.705 --> 08:42.696
I can't wear this.
I look like I'm 16.

08:42.807 --> 08:44.297
<i>- Michael?
- Oh, no.</i>

08:44.409 --> 08:46.377
- Hello, Michael.
- Stan.

08:46.478 --> 08:49.811
- Hello, Sally.
- Hi. So, are you meeting someone here for lunch?

08:49.915 --> 08:53.043
No. I was going to, then they canceled.
So I'm gonna take off.

08:53.151 --> 08:56.609
<i>- No. Just join us, please.
- Michael knew he couldn't say no...</i>

08:56.721 --> 09:00.384
<i>- but he also knew he couldn't
flirt in front ofher father.
- Let's do it.</i>

09:00.492 --> 09:04.394
<i>And at another table,
Gob was being taken out to lunch.</i>

09:04.496 --> 09:06.396
Read me the appetizers again.

09:06.498 --> 09:10.491
Fried cheese with club sauce.

09:10.602 --> 09:15.403
Popcorn shrimp with club sauce.

09:15.507 --> 09:17.634
Chicken fingers-

09:17.742 --> 09:19.972
Oh, stop it.
You're making me dizzy.

09:20.078 --> 09:22.569
With spicy club sauce.

09:22.681 --> 09:24.979
No! I mean stop it.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.449
- Gob?
- Michael.

09:27.552 --> 09:29.417
- Why don't you join us?
- Oh, no.

09:29.521 --> 09:33.150
- I'm just helping her eat.
- Oh, if you'd prefer privacy-

09:33.258 --> 09:37.194
<i>What? No. Are you kidding? I didn't even
wanna have lunch with her in the first place.</i>

09:37.295 --> 09:41.356
I just- or- I ju-

09:41.466 --> 09:44.765
<i>And so lunch continued
with both Bluth boys trying to prove...</i>

09:44.869 --> 09:48.498
<i>they weren't interested in the
women they were interested in.</i>

09:48.607 --> 09:52.441
When I saw those golf carts,
it kind of brought back some memories.

09:52.544 --> 09:54.774
Did you have too much club sauce
on your calamari?

09:54.879 --> 09:58.042
<i>Gob, read me the desserts.</i>

09:58.149 --> 09:59.844
She p-

09:59.951 --> 10:02.317
probably forgot
her old lady glasses.

10:02.420 --> 10:04.388
What is the matter
with you, Goby?

10:04.489 --> 10:07.185
<i>I'm happy to read to the lovely lady.</i>

10:07.292 --> 10:10.352
An assortment
of ice creams and sorbets.

10:10.462 --> 10:12.692
- You all right with him reading to your girl?
- Not my girl.

10:12.797 --> 10:14.856
- Huh?
- Why don't you read to your girl?

10:14.966 --> 10:17.264
Come on. I don't have
a girl. No, thanks.

10:17.369 --> 10:19.837
- Already taken care of. Thank you. Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

10:19.938 --> 10:22.839
Apparently there's been some
increased activity on your card.

10:22.941 --> 10:25.136
It's been declined.

10:25.243 --> 10:29.304
<i>In fact, the increased activity
on Michael's card was his father's.</i>

10:29.414 --> 10:31.905
You think a hot tub is the best thing
for someone with your condition?

10:32.017 --> 10:36.317
I can't see, but, uh, I didn't know
there was a doctor installing this.

10:36.421 --> 10:38.981
Somebody order a case
of Bag & Boil frozen dinners?

10:39.090 --> 10:42.287
- I'm happy to get this.
- No, no. No, please, Stan. I'll do it. Um-

10:42.394 --> 10:44.885
Can you put this on my mother's card?

10:44.996 --> 10:47.863
Your mother? No. No, no, no.
She's a pool member only.

10:47.966 --> 10:50.161
<i>You'll excuse me
if my tone is not polite...</i>

10:50.268 --> 10:52.566
but this is more polite
than she has ever talked to me.

10:52.671 --> 10:57.005
<i>Michael had a feeling
why his credit card had been rejected.</i>

10:57.108 --> 11:00.202
What the hell did you do?

11:00.311 --> 11:03.007
I overdid it.

11:03.114 --> 11:05.947
Oh, it's so hot.

11:10.677 --> 11:14.909
<i>Michael's father had just
installed a hot tub in the attic.</i>

11:15.015 --> 11:18.007
- What happened to you?
- I tried to drink some of the water...

11:18.118 --> 11:20.848
and it was too hot,
and it tasted like soy sauce.

11:20.954 --> 11:24.822
<i>I think the teriyaki chicken burst.</i>

11:24.925 --> 11:28.053
That's why people typically don't cook
in these things or install them in attics.

11:28.162 --> 11:32.462
You gotta get it out of here,
Mikey. My eyes, they're burning.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.693
<i>Wanna thank you for charging it
to my credit card.</i>

11:34.801 --> 11:37.031
You made me look very foolish
in front of Sally Sitwell.

11:37.137 --> 11:39.298
- Did you stick it to her?
- No, I didn't.

11:39.406 --> 11:42.136
You screwed that up, just like
you screwed up this hot tub.

11:42.242 --> 11:44.210
Is that veal Marsala
stuck in the intake?

11:44.311 --> 11:47.075
They all look so good
on the boxes.

11:47.181 --> 11:49.206
You know, it's good
you backed off Sally.

11:49.316 --> 11:54.845
<i>I don't need that guy saying his
daughter's sticking it to my loser son.</i>

11:54.955 --> 11:59.790
You know something? The reason I never went
after her is because you're always pushing me.

11:59.893 --> 12:03.693
<i>But now that I know that I don't have
your approval, l-I think that, uh...</i>

12:03.797 --> 12:06.595
I think that I'll
finally go for it.

12:06.700 --> 12:11.569
<i>This isn't turning into
the party hangout I hoped.</i>

12:13.040 --> 12:15.668
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, I thought I heard something before...</i>

12:15.776 --> 12:17.767
like a wolf drowning
or something.

12:17.878 --> 12:20.244
I think that that was
maybe the house settling.

12:20.347 --> 12:22.815
Speaking of settling, how's Ann?
I mean, have you-

12:22.916 --> 12:25.544
have you settled on an
artist's work to burn?

12:25.652 --> 12:27.711
- I was thinking Eminem for a while.
- Sure.

12:27.821 --> 12:30.312
But everyone is gonna be burning
Eminem. So, you know-

12:30.424 --> 12:33.757
And then I got this Pat Boone
album, but the guy is Christian.

12:33.860 --> 12:36.488
But, you know, I don't know.
Somebody's gotta burn, right?

12:36.597 --> 12:39.828
- Well, I guess.
- Right.

12:43.170 --> 12:46.571
- Hey.
- Oh, boy. I got some looks
on the bus 'cause of this.

12:46.673 --> 12:48.504
What are you doing
with that thing?

12:48.609 --> 12:52.067
I am going to catch that wolf, Michael. I'm
gonna shoot it with this tranquilizer gun...

12:52.179 --> 12:55.273
get the reward, and bid on my
woman at the charity auction.

12:55.382 --> 12:58.545
Isn't there some kind of a waiting period
for a rifle like that?

12:58.652 --> 13:00.620
It turns out there is.

13:00.721 --> 13:03.121
Two weeks?
Isn't there a loophole?

13:03.223 --> 13:05.953
There is a gun show loophole.

13:06.059 --> 13:09.825
What timing, huh? I mean, right
out back they were having one.

13:09.930 --> 13:12.831
Gob, I'm going hunting
for my wife.

13:12.933 --> 13:15.265
<i>How lame was Lucille 2 at lunch, huh?</i>

13:15.369 --> 13:17.337
You've gotten attached, haven't you?

13:17.437 --> 13:19.632
You're not gonna tell
anybody about this, are you?

13:19.740 --> 13:21.640
Come on. I'm not one to judge.

13:21.742 --> 13:24.802
Every time I've gone out with Sally,
I've looked like I'm 12 years old.

13:24.911 --> 13:27.709
But, yes, I probably will
tell people about this.

13:27.814 --> 13:32.308
Maybe we can strike up a deal. You keep
this to yourself, I help you get Sally.

13:32.419 --> 13:34.387
Siphon a little
something from her car...

13:34.488 --> 13:36.979
you show up in the Corvette,
looking like a man.

13:37.090 --> 13:38.990
Car troubles?

13:39.092 --> 13:41.356
Probably shouldn't do the fireball
when you siphon the gas.

13:41.461 --> 13:44.794
I guess this flint's still got
a little life left in it, huh?

13:44.898 --> 13:48.561
<i>Lindsay, meanwhile, was waiting
in the park for her date with Moses Taylor.</i>

13:48.669 --> 13:51.194
<i>Sorry I'm late. Fans.</i>

13:51.305 --> 13:54.502
Sometimes it takes a while to jar their memories.

13:54.608 --> 13:59.409
Nice fur. You know, there are some nuts out
there who'd wanna throw red paint all over you.

13:59.513 --> 14:03.142
Wait a minute. I think
there's one right over there.

14:03.250 --> 14:06.515
- Oh, my God. You're-
- Someone needs to read this.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.589
<i>And that's when Lindsay's heel went out.</i>

14:13.927 --> 14:16.760
- I got him.
- False alarm.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.023
Crap.

14:24.338 --> 14:28.434
<i>- I'm being saved by Frank Wrench.
- No, you're not.</i>

14:28.542 --> 14:30.533
- Frank Wrench.
- Shut up.

14:30.644 --> 14:33.704
<i>But, unbeknownst
to Lindsay and Tobias-
- Oh, shoot.</i>

14:33.814 --> 14:37.113
<i>- Oh, great.
- the actor who played Frank Wrench
wasn't saving her...</i>

14:37.217 --> 14:39.583
<i>but was just trying
to distance himself...</i>

14:39.686 --> 14:43.622
<i>from the outlandish "Moses
Taylor Hunts People"scandal...</i>

14:43.724 --> 14:46.955
<i>that had been started
by a rabid anti-gun fanatic.</i>

14:50.831 --> 14:53.595
<i>And that night,
Michael went to help Sally...</i>

14:53.700 --> 14:56.260
<i>with the car problems
Gob had created.</i>

14:56.370 --> 14:59.339
What the hell?

14:59.439 --> 15:02.602
<i>Only to find out
things had gotten out ofhand for Gob.</i>

15:02.709 --> 15:05.610
<i>Michael did look heroic as
he went to put out the fire.</i>

15:05.712 --> 15:08.909
<i>Unfortunately, Sally arrived
too late to see him that way.</i>

15:09.015 --> 15:10.915
God, what happened?

15:11.017 --> 15:14.783
Car trouble.

15:19.006 --> 15:21.474
<i>Gob had just blown up a car.</i>

15:21.575 --> 15:23.975
The next thing I know,
I'm running for my life.

15:24.078 --> 15:27.570
And all I could think was, if something
were to ever happen to me...

15:27.681 --> 15:29.581
how sad I'd be, you know?

15:29.683 --> 15:33.449
What you did to me at lunch today-
You were ashamed to be with me.

15:33.554 --> 15:38.423
<i>No! I was ashamed to be seen
with you. I like being with you.</i>

15:38.526 --> 15:42.257
I'm sorry,
but you have no courage.

15:42.363 --> 15:44.661
How can you say that? Shh.

15:44.765 --> 15:49.099
I thought I heard my mom.
How can you say that?

15:49.203 --> 15:51.671
<i>- And on the other side of the wall-
- Michael?</i>

15:51.772 --> 15:53.899
<i>Lucille was finalizing
her plans for the evening.</i>

15:54.008 --> 15:55.908
You can bid up to 10,000.

15:56.010 --> 15:58.706
The deal is off. You didn't
tell me it was a restricted membership.

15:58.813 --> 16:00.610
Find somebody else
to do your bidding.

16:00.714 --> 16:02.511
There is no one else.

16:02.616 --> 16:04.880
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:04.985 --> 16:07.647
- They said I could see you finally.
- Yes.

16:07.755 --> 16:11.282
God, I just feel awful
for whoever's car that was.

16:11.392 --> 16:14.691
Mm-hmm. I know it.

16:14.795 --> 16:18.856
Sally, I was thinking that maybe you
and I could-

16:18.966 --> 16:23.062
Don't try to talk. I have to run anyway.
I gotta do this charity auction thing.

16:23.170 --> 16:27.698
<i>I'm sorry, sir. Your Blue Cross Blue Shield
was denied. We've called your mother.</i>

16:30.845 --> 16:34.474
I'll be back. I'll check
on you later. Feel better.

16:34.582 --> 16:38.279
Go out sometime.

16:38.385 --> 16:40.853
<i>Michael decided
to bid on her at the auction...</i>

16:40.955 --> 16:43.924
<i>and he knewjust where he
could get the money to do so.</i>

16:44.024 --> 16:47.187
Yeah. Start draining
the hot tub. It's going back.

16:47.294 --> 16:49.922
<i>And Lucille, with no other prospects...</i>

16:50.030 --> 16:52.828
<i>turned to the son she least
expected to support her.</i>

16:52.933 --> 16:57.768
Gob, I don't suppose I could pay you
to bid on me at a charity auction.

16:57.872 --> 17:00.705
<i>And Gob was just
depressed enough to do so.</i>

17:00.808 --> 17:02.935
- Whatever you want.
- Oh, goody.

17:03.043 --> 17:05.511
<i>And finally, George Michael and Ann's...</i>

17:05.613 --> 17:08.241
<i>Christian music bonfire was under way.</i>

17:08.348 --> 17:12.342
- Without ever going to the gym.
- I can't believe how many
people you told about this.

17:12.453 --> 17:15.718
Yeah, I hope I didn't confuse people
by saying it was a CD burning party.

17:15.823 --> 17:17.790
Great party!

17:17.892 --> 17:20.884
Maeby, I burned like 10 CD's
from somebody's MP3 player.

17:20.994 --> 17:22.895
This is a disaster.

17:22.997 --> 17:25.464
<i>Maybe you shouldjust try
listening to some of the music.</i>

17:25.566 --> 17:27.693
Yeah, some of the artists
are kind of talented.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.464
I don't know if you've heard ofThe
Jerky Boys. They do prank phone calls.

17:31.572 --> 17:35.201
It's kind of old school, but-
I have the tape in my room.

17:35.309 --> 17:37.800
I accidentally didn't burn it yet.

17:39.313 --> 17:41.781
<i>- Meanwhile, the auction began.
- Next up...</i>

17:41.882 --> 17:44.680
<i>we've got last year's
charity case, Lindsay Fünke.</i>

17:44.785 --> 17:47.253
<i>- Lindsay showed up-
- Oh, no. Not again.</i>

17:47.354 --> 17:50.323
<i>although she was still
feeling the effects of the tranquilizer.</i>

17:50.424 --> 17:53.825
- Hundred dollars, folks?
- Stick a wrench in me. I'm done.

17:53.928 --> 17:55.759
<i>- Anybody got 50?
- My wife is humiliated.</i>

17:55.863 --> 17:59.390
This is my chance to right
the small wrong that I did.

17:59.500 --> 18:03.095
You shot her in the ass with about
four ounces of horse tranquilizer.

18:03.203 --> 18:06.001
<i>I haven't been the perfect husband.
Yes, I admit that.
- Twenty?</i>

18:06.106 --> 18:08.574
But now is my chance to be a hero.

18:08.676 --> 18:11.509
<i>- Please, Michael, give me some of your money.
- Ten?</i>

18:11.612 --> 18:14.581
<i>- Does anybody have 10?
- I've got $5,000, and I need that for Sally...</i>

18:14.682 --> 18:17.913
- but if you wanna make a low bid-
- Five thousand dollars.

18:18.018 --> 18:20.987
For that? Sold.

18:21.088 --> 18:23.249
I think you overpaid.

18:23.357 --> 18:25.655
<i>George Michael's
prospects were also improving...</i>

18:25.759 --> 18:28.523
<i>- as the two made prank phone calls together.
- Let me try.</i>

18:29.563 --> 18:31.656
- Hey, rubberneck.
- Ann...

18:31.765 --> 18:35.030
could you and George Michael please
call someone else for a little while?

18:35.135 --> 18:37.103
- He knows it was us.
- What?

18:44.078 --> 18:46.103
<i>We finally got a good
one comin'up.</i>

18:46.213 --> 18:49.774
Sally Sitwell. What do I hear?

18:49.883 --> 18:52.647
<i>- Five hundred dollars.
- You're not bidding? I was hoping you would.</i>

18:52.753 --> 18:54.618
<i>- Six hundred!
- You were?</i>

18:54.722 --> 18:56.417
You're a good kid.
You always have been.

18:56.523 --> 18:59.151
Not like that showboat of a father
of yours, if you don't mind me saying.

18:59.259 --> 19:01.989
<i>- Seven hundred!
- I've called him so much worse.</i>

19:02.096 --> 19:04.690
The truth is, sir,
I am interested...

19:04.798 --> 19:07.289
but I don't have the money
to buy your daughter.

19:07.401 --> 19:11.030
<i>- You sure do drive a nice car.
- Eight hundred.</i>

19:11.138 --> 19:13.732
And I need one.
Mine got torched today.

19:13.841 --> 19:16.901
<i>One thousand!
Drop it off when you drop
my daughter off tonight.</i>

19:17.011 --> 19:20.811
<i>And finally, with
both the approval of Sally's father...</i>

19:20.914 --> 19:25.874
<i>and the lack of approval ofhis own,
Michael was ready to make his move.</i>

19:25.986 --> 19:29.217
<i>- 15,000.
- What?</i>

19:29.323 --> 19:31.314
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:31.425 --> 19:33.655
I gotta tell ya.
This puts a lot of pressure on me.

19:33.761 --> 19:36.924
- It's for a good cause.
- I heard it was to reseed the greens.

19:37.031 --> 19:40.330
Gonna be a lot of shifts for you
at the banana stand, huh?

19:40.434 --> 19:43.232
I should be honest with you.
I don't have that much money...

19:43.337 --> 19:46.738
- and I sold the Corvette to cover it.
- That's quick. To who?

19:46.840 --> 19:49.434
- Your father, as a matter of fact.
- My father?

19:49.543 --> 19:52.205
- Yeah.
- My father can't drive a convertible.

19:52.312 --> 19:54.337
Mind if I open it up?

19:56.316 --> 19:58.341
Wow!

19:58.452 --> 20:01.353
<i>- Got some pickup.
- This is just like him.</i>

20:01.455 --> 20:03.616
He always interferes
with everyone I date.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.921
Well, you can tell him
to give you your car back.

20:07.027 --> 20:10.929
- But I bought you.
- I'm sorry. I'm not like you.

20:11.031 --> 20:15.695
I'd almost rather date someone
my father doesn't approve of.

20:15.803 --> 20:18.601
Thanks anyway.

20:21.542 --> 20:25.876
That-That-That is like me.
That's exactly like me!

20:25.979 --> 20:29.005
<i>And soon it was time
for Gob to bid on his mother.</i>

20:29.116 --> 20:33.075
Not all bad. The only one bidding
on Lucille 2 is that hairless Sitwell.

20:33.187 --> 20:34.950
<i>Seven right there. Eight.</i>

20:35.055 --> 20:36.886
<i>- Sitwell's bidding on Lucille 2?
- Nine.</i>

20:36.990 --> 20:40.517
First he fires me,
then he steals my-

20:40.627 --> 20:43.460
<i>- Going once-
- mother's best friend.</i>

20:43.564 --> 20:45.794
Going twice.
Nine going twice.

20:45.899 --> 20:49.096
- $10,000.
- Oh, how grand.

20:49.203 --> 20:53.401
<i>Sold. Up from $800
to $ 10,000.</i>

20:53.507 --> 20:56.499
<i>Wow. You guys really
want a new golf course.</i>

20:56.610 --> 20:59.909
And all from nonmembers.

21:00.013 --> 21:02.743
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

21:02.850 --> 21:06.081
<i>George Sr. Shows up to bid on Lucille.</i>

21:06.186 --> 21:08.154
<i>But the sound ofhis wolf call...</i>

21:08.255 --> 21:10.951
<i>and the smell of chicken
teriyaki interfere.</i>

21:11.058 --> 21:12.958
No, no, no, no.

21:13.060 --> 21:15.824
<i>No. Oh.
Oh. Oh, no.</i>
