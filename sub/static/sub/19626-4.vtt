_

00:07.683 --> 00:08.686
_

00:12.110 --> 00:13.320
Dan?

00:14.445 --> 00:16.079
You hear anything?

00:16.114 --> 00:17.211
Nothing.

00:17.815 --> 00:19.917
That doesn't mean they're not on to me.

00:19.951 --> 00:22.085
Anyone at Ingersol do or say anything

00:22.120 --> 00:23.787
to make you think they're suspicious?

00:23.821 --> 00:25.522
- No.
- That's good, right?

00:25.556 --> 00:27.124
That's actually what
worries me the most.

00:27.158 --> 00:29.326
I understand how hard
this is for you, Dan.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.795
And we both know no
matter how many procedures

00:31.829 --> 00:34.712
we've put in place, there's
always gonna be some risk.

00:37.235 --> 00:38.325
Dan?

00:42.473 --> 00:45.943
At the end of the day,
this has to be your call.

00:45.977 --> 00:47.581
I can't force you.

00:48.012 --> 00:49.012
Right.

00:49.096 --> 00:51.181
We're up on all
Ingersol's phones, servers,

00:51.215 --> 00:53.183
emails, you name it,
and you know I would be

00:53.217 --> 00:55.986
the first to tell you if
we picked up any red flags.

00:57.488 --> 01:00.357
I just want this to be over, Riley.

01:00.391 --> 01:01.675
Me too.

01:03.494 --> 01:06.530
And for no more of our
soldiers to die from this drug.

01:08.499 --> 01:11.969
Ingersol Pharmaceuticals
has to be stopped, Dan.

01:14.339 --> 01:15.339
Dan?

01:19.344 --> 01:22.346
Do you know the red box
trail in Shenandoah State Park?

01:22.380 --> 01:23.597
I can find it.

01:24.182 --> 01:26.450
Meet me there at 8:30 A.M.

01:28.186 --> 01:29.987
Proud of you, Dan.

01:30.435 --> 01:31.435
Yeah.

01:36.594 --> 01:38.585
- Well done.
- Finally...

01:39.530 --> 01:41.098
A year later.

01:41.132 --> 01:43.233
Have you met at this place before?

01:43.267 --> 01:45.033
- Always a different location.
- Could we pick

01:45.153 --> 01:47.452
- him up without you?
- What? How?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.661
- No, she has to be there.
- She's not a field operative.

01:49.781 --> 01:52.924
If I'm not there, alone, by the way,
Dan's a no-show, guaranteed.

01:53.044 --> 01:55.532
- This meeting place is not ideal...
- Dan has procedures for

01:55.652 --> 01:58.115
everything, and he will
only meet on his terms.

01:58.149 --> 02:00.384
This data he smuggled
out of Ingersol...

02:00.418 --> 02:03.286
He insisted on hiding it for
a three-day incubation period

02:03.321 --> 02:04.955
while we monitored to
see if they realized

02:04.989 --> 02:06.556
anything was missing.

02:06.591 --> 02:07.988
What do you think?

02:09.092 --> 02:12.277
- I think if he's for real...
- Oh, he's for real, all right.

02:15.400 --> 02:19.202
Then I know four soldiers
this drug has killed.

03:02.346 --> 03:03.901
- Dan.
- You alone?

03:04.615 --> 03:05.809
Of course.

03:07.051 --> 03:08.985
I have to ask you something.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.020
Sure.

03:11.489 --> 03:15.258
That story that you told
me about your mother...

03:15.293 --> 03:18.173
- Was that really...
- True? Yes.

03:18.463 --> 03:21.198
Do you honestly think
that I would make that up?

03:21.232 --> 03:23.100
Is that why they chose you?

03:23.134 --> 03:24.657
To recruit me?

03:25.336 --> 03:28.972
That is the word that
you people use, isn't it?

03:29.006 --> 03:30.728
- Recruit?
- Yes.

03:32.477 --> 03:34.111
It's why they chose me.

03:41.152 --> 03:43.520
It's right over there.
It's under the deadfall.

03:43.554 --> 03:46.044
It's a couple of inches under the dirt.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.238
You owe me a manicure.

04:00.075 --> 04:01.471
Oh, no.

04:01.506 --> 04:03.974
What did I tell you? I told you.

04:04.008 --> 04:05.375
- It's okay.
- Oh, god.

04:05.409 --> 04:06.977
- Just give them the laptop.
- It's okay.

04:07.011 --> 04:08.411
- Dan, it's okay.
- Give them the laptop, please.

04:08.446 --> 04:10.147
- It's okay!
- Give them the laptop, please!

04:13.751 --> 04:15.519
Now! Go!

04:19.190 --> 04:20.760
That was a warning!

04:21.692 --> 04:23.138
Prepare to move.

04:26.197 --> 04:27.531
They're outta here.

04:27.565 --> 04:30.754
- Let 'em go. Stay with the package.
- Roger. Moving now.

04:34.472 --> 04:36.273
Are you okay?

04:36.307 --> 04:39.509
- I'm dead.
- We're in the culvert.

04:39.544 --> 04:41.144
I'm dead.

04:42.547 --> 04:44.047
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

04:44.081 --> 04:45.433
You said that they didn't know!

04:45.456 --> 04:46.627
- Dan...
- You said that!

04:46.747 --> 04:47.784
- Dan...
- You said they couldn't...

04:47.818 --> 04:50.420
She said there was always a risk.

04:50.454 --> 04:52.456
I know that, because I was there.

04:53.558 --> 04:56.226
And you're safe now. We got you.

05:08.172 --> 05:09.472
What is it?

05:09.507 --> 05:11.228
It's my daughter.

05:12.443 --> 05:14.110
They have my...

05:14.145 --> 05:16.112
My daughter... my Mattie.

05:19.020 --> 05:20.230
My baby.

05:28.785 --> 05:29.906
No way!

05:30.620 --> 05:33.369
Not until I get my daughter
back. Even then, I...

05:33.489 --> 05:35.424
The only way I'm gonna
get my daughter back

05:35.458 --> 05:37.759
is if I return that laptop untouched.

05:37.794 --> 05:39.361
Where is it, by the way?

05:39.395 --> 05:41.944
They better not be
trying to hack into it.

05:42.064 --> 05:43.699
- They're not.
- Because they can't?

05:43.733 --> 05:45.367
Because we are not going to do anything

05:45.401 --> 05:47.135
to further jeopardize Mattie.

05:49.572 --> 05:51.540
Password's encrypted, you know.

05:51.660 --> 05:54.309
You enter it wrong once, the
entire hard drive self-deletes.

05:54.344 --> 05:55.811
And Ingersol keeps pushing Sangravan.

05:55.845 --> 05:58.409
Don't do that. Don't try
to make me feel guilty.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.315
All I'm doing is telling
you... Promising you

06:00.350 --> 06:02.117
that right now, your
daughter comes first.

06:02.151 --> 06:04.567
You think I forgot about those
soldiers who died from Sangravan?

06:04.687 --> 06:07.637
- Who've died and are going to die.
- You just did it again.

06:07.757 --> 06:10.225
- Who else have you told?
- About Sangravan?

06:10.259 --> 06:11.950
About my daughter.

06:12.595 --> 06:13.717
No one.

06:14.263 --> 06:15.741
How 'bout the FBI?

06:15.861 --> 06:17.632
We're gonna and wait and see
what the demands are first.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.735
But you know what the
demands are gonna be.

06:19.769 --> 06:22.064
- Right.
- So you're willing to do that?

06:22.184 --> 06:24.172
You're willing to return the laptop?

06:24.207 --> 06:25.474
Of course.

06:25.508 --> 06:27.939
- Well, what about National Security?
- Excuse me?

06:29.612 --> 06:31.246
Well, all I've heard from
Riley over the last year

06:31.280 --> 06:32.647
is national security, National Security.

06:32.682 --> 06:34.716
What Ingersol's doing
with Sangravan is a threat

06:34.751 --> 06:37.252
- to National Security.
- Hold that thought. Come in.

06:37.286 --> 06:38.854
She manipulated me, you know,

06:38.888 --> 06:40.522
with that story about her mother.

06:40.556 --> 06:42.190
If caring is manipulating...

06:42.225 --> 06:44.593
and who put her up
to that? Was that you?

06:44.627 --> 06:45.827
I'm her boss, if that's what you mean.

06:45.862 --> 06:47.329
- Yeah?
- You got a minute?

06:47.363 --> 06:48.864
What's the news?

06:48.898 --> 06:50.599
What about security camera footage?

06:50.633 --> 06:52.901
- I have a security camera.
- They're working on it.

06:52.935 --> 06:54.903
Excuse me for a minute.

06:56.205 --> 06:58.340
Just get my daughter back.

07:08.284 --> 07:09.851
We got into the security camera.

07:09.886 --> 07:12.006
- And?
- Not good.

07:14.010 --> 07:16.039
Stay with him for a minute.

07:16.159 --> 07:17.692
Stay with him.

07:31.908 --> 07:34.332
You're not vegetarian, are you?

07:35.278 --> 07:36.845
I'm not hungry.

07:39.215 --> 07:41.082
- Can I say something?
- If it's more of the same...

07:41.117 --> 07:42.784
To try to get me to give
you the access code...

07:42.818 --> 07:46.054
So far, that drug has
killed three of my friends.

07:46.088 --> 07:48.790
- What did I just tell you?
- Just...

07:48.824 --> 07:50.725
Listen for a second.

07:54.163 --> 07:55.601
Two green berets...

07:57.833 --> 08:02.137
And the best helicopter
pilot I ever saw.

08:02.171 --> 08:07.367
So yes, you better believe
we're gonna do all we can

08:07.487 --> 08:09.402
to get your daughter back

08:09.522 --> 08:12.947
and shut down Ingersol Pharmaceuticals.

08:17.653 --> 08:18.690
Eat.

08:19.188 --> 08:21.623
- Uh, those go upstairs.
- All right.

08:23.192 --> 08:24.893
Uh, excuse me.

08:24.927 --> 08:26.127
Oh, hey.

08:26.162 --> 08:28.930
Hi, sorry. Wow, oh.

08:28.964 --> 08:30.932
- Oh, moving in?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:30.966 --> 08:33.658
- Uh, Elena.
- Asha. That's me.

08:33.778 --> 08:35.937
Oh, I hope we didn't...
we didn't wake you.

08:35.971 --> 08:38.106
No, no, I'm an early bird anyway.

08:39.808 --> 08:41.609
Now that's what I'm talking about.

08:41.644 --> 08:43.611
Good to meet you, Elena.

08:43.645 --> 08:46.181
- And you, Asha.
- Bring it up here.

08:48.117 --> 08:50.852
- Where's her mother?
- He's a single dad.

08:50.886 --> 08:53.688
- There a babysitter?
- They took her out first.

08:53.722 --> 08:56.257
- Is she dead?
- Sedated.

08:56.292 --> 08:58.126
Guessing Ingersol told
them no body count

08:58.160 --> 09:01.629
- until, you know...
- It counts.

09:01.664 --> 09:05.368
Whole thing from start
to finish took 49 seconds.

09:05.488 --> 09:07.969
Neighbors never saw or heard a thing.

09:31.727 --> 09:33.248
I'm so sorry, Dan.

09:33.368 --> 09:36.375
- Just get her out of here, please.
- I'm not leaving. Sorry.

09:58.254 --> 10:01.789
Dan, we need to get you ready
for the ransom call, okay?

10:03.993 --> 10:05.493
Right a bit. Right a...

10:05.528 --> 10:07.062
Oh, perfect, perfect.

10:07.096 --> 10:09.243
- Here?
- Oh, careful.

10:09.363 --> 10:11.900
Don't think you wanna
pull that muscle, heh?

10:22.111 --> 10:23.645
Asha?

10:23.679 --> 10:25.046
Oh, my god.

10:25.081 --> 10:27.082
Asha, what's going on?
I heard something.

10:27.116 --> 10:30.051
- Asha, open the door.
- There was a man in my house.

10:30.086 --> 10:31.653
- Oh, my god.
- He went... no, no, no,

10:31.687 --> 10:33.521
it's not safe. He went out the back.

10:33.556 --> 10:35.023
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah.

10:35.057 --> 10:37.049
- What'd he look like?
- It happened so fast.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.442
- 911, what is your emergency?
- Yeah, hey, there's been a break-in.

10:48.037 --> 10:50.068
- Hello?
- This is very simple...

10:50.188 --> 10:52.560
The computer for the girl.

10:54.810 --> 10:56.886
Let me talk to my daughter first.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.453
Dad?

10:59.749 --> 11:01.139
Dad, are you there?

11:01.616 --> 11:03.719
- Dad?
- Mattie...

11:03.753 --> 11:07.155
- Darling, I am so sorry.
- Here's what's gonna happen.

11:07.190 --> 11:10.082
- Ready?
- Yeah. What?

11:11.728 --> 11:14.685
I'll do anything. Anything. Please.

11:20.366 --> 11:22.618
_

11:33.455 --> 11:36.257
You should put it in your pocket.

11:36.291 --> 11:38.796
They said it... it has to be just me.

11:40.629 --> 11:41.640
No one else.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.036
Keep a hand on the phone at all times,

11:44.156 --> 11:46.601
in case you don't hear it ring.
It's set to vibrate as well.

11:46.635 --> 11:48.758
They said if they see anyone
else in there, she dies.

11:48.878 --> 11:50.340
No one's gonna die.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.540
You think you can just say that,

11:52.574 --> 11:54.275
and that makes it so?

11:57.513 --> 11:58.614
Sorry.

11:59.137 --> 12:00.265
My bad.

12:01.317 --> 12:02.354
Check, check.

12:02.474 --> 12:03.854
- Check.
- Check.

12:04.286 --> 12:05.703
And check.

12:05.823 --> 12:08.308
I'm into their security cameras.

12:08.391 --> 12:10.859
Oof. When was your last flu shot?

12:10.893 --> 12:12.894
Echinacea, baby, all the way.

12:12.929 --> 12:14.496
Hey, Dan...

12:15.731 --> 12:17.032
Look at me.

12:19.135 --> 12:21.903
We all want the same result here, okay?

12:22.414 --> 12:23.805
They said alone.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.774
And that's all they're gonna see.

12:27.810 --> 12:29.334
12 minutes to go.

12:37.432 --> 12:39.350
Anything missing?

12:39.470 --> 12:43.024
I don't... I... I thought it
better not to touch anything.

12:45.928 --> 12:48.396
So you guys just going
through the motions

12:48.431 --> 12:49.931
or are you actually gonna do something?

12:49.966 --> 12:51.666
- Ma'am...
- She's just trying to help.

12:51.701 --> 12:53.274
- Ma'am?
- Miss, this guy covers

12:53.394 --> 12:55.786
tracks pretty well. He
knew what he was doing.

12:55.906 --> 12:57.606
Do you have anywhere you can
go for the next couple days?

12:57.640 --> 12:59.772
- Yeah, she can crash with me.
- No, no, you just moved in.

12:59.892 --> 13:01.270
- No, no problem.
- Friends, family member,

13:01.390 --> 13:02.575
somebody you can trust?

13:02.695 --> 13:06.147
Why? What's going on?
What are you not saying?

13:06.182 --> 13:09.417
This guy was in your
underwear drawer, miss.

13:09.452 --> 13:11.086
And it's not the first case
of stalking that we've seen

13:11.120 --> 13:13.736
- in the neighborhood in the last year.
- Well, that's great.

13:13.856 --> 13:16.191
Of a young, successful,
attractive woman.

13:16.225 --> 13:17.959
Are you hitting on her now?

13:17.994 --> 13:19.594
We'll have some mobile
units watch the building

13:19.629 --> 13:21.763
for the next couple
days. In the meantime,

13:21.797 --> 13:24.124
if there's anyone you can call...

13:26.135 --> 13:27.636
A stalker?

13:41.918 --> 13:43.718
Tell me this is gonna work.

13:46.155 --> 13:47.970
It's time.

14:29.629 --> 14:32.100
We should be all over
Ingersol Pharmaceutical

14:32.134 --> 14:33.768
- by now as well.
- We will be.

14:33.803 --> 14:35.493
- When?
- Once this part is over.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.739
- And if this part...
- Don't.

14:39.241 --> 14:41.272
I know that little girl.

14:41.777 --> 14:43.244
I made her my friend...

14:43.279 --> 14:45.980
Helped her with her ballet,
went to her recitals.

14:46.015 --> 14:49.250
You remember what I told you
about overinvesting emotionally?

14:51.153 --> 14:52.453
Okay?

14:54.490 --> 14:55.957
He's moving to the
bench by the carousel,

14:55.991 --> 14:57.225
like they instructed.

15:07.870 --> 15:10.939
- Mattie?
- Oh, hey.

15:31.293 --> 15:33.828
One level up. Cue ball.

15:35.297 --> 15:36.431
Roger.

15:36.465 --> 15:38.266
Alpha, acknowledge.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.500
Roger. Seen.

15:49.478 --> 15:51.955
- We all got dog lady?
- Got her.

15:52.075 --> 15:54.978
It's a cute ass dog. Not fair.

16:01.991 --> 16:04.492
They're coming in like ants.

16:04.526 --> 16:06.175
Roger that.

16:06.495 --> 16:09.130
Eight tourists and counting,
from all directions.

16:09.164 --> 16:11.466
Beginning to feel a lot like
a killing zone in there.

16:27.249 --> 16:28.816
Have you seen Mattie? Where is she?

16:28.851 --> 16:30.418
Try to relax.

16:30.452 --> 16:32.053
Act like you're talking
to your wife or something.

16:32.087 --> 16:34.236
My wife dumped us eight years
ago. Have you seen Mattie?

16:34.356 --> 16:35.990
You need to move to your right,

16:36.025 --> 16:37.859
towards the airplanes...
fast as you can.

16:37.893 --> 16:39.327
- Why?
- Just do it now, please.

16:39.361 --> 16:40.628
Thank you.

16:43.232 --> 16:44.856
Oh, excuse me.

16:45.234 --> 16:47.335
Hey, pooch. Do you mind?

16:50.906 --> 16:52.473
Lose the earwig.

16:59.081 --> 17:00.882
- Mattie.
- Where?

17:00.916 --> 17:03.017
She's over there. She's
heading into the arcade.

17:03.052 --> 17:04.352
- Don't move.
- I see her.

17:04.386 --> 17:06.020
- Stay where you are.
- 12 tourists now.

17:06.055 --> 17:07.355
This is about to go south.

17:07.388 --> 17:10.590
This is not an exchange. It's an ambush.

17:10.626 --> 17:12.359
- Roll it up.
- What?

17:12.394 --> 17:13.594
Get him out. No noise.

17:13.628 --> 17:15.948
- There's too many kids. Do it now.
- Roger.

17:24.406 --> 17:26.540
Heads up. On your toes.

17:26.575 --> 17:29.255
Later, dog lady. Never forget a face.

17:45.127 --> 17:46.427
- What are you doing?
- Gotta go.

17:46.462 --> 17:48.229
No, no, no, no, no, no. No!

17:48.263 --> 17:49.931
You want your daughter to live?

17:49.965 --> 17:51.499
- You wanna live?
- She's in there right now.

17:51.533 --> 17:54.068
- Don't fight me.
- She's in there right now!

17:59.508 --> 18:01.276
No!

18:01.977 --> 18:03.244
What are you doing?

18:14.623 --> 18:16.958
No... you can't do this!

18:16.992 --> 18:18.259
You can't do this!

18:18.293 --> 18:20.261
It's not supposed to happen this way!

18:20.295 --> 18:21.629
It's not suppo...

18:21.663 --> 18:24.632
It's not supposed to happen this way!

18:25.737 --> 18:27.013
What are you gonna

18:27.133 --> 18:29.003
do about my daughter?
They're gonna kill her!

18:29.038 --> 18:30.505
It's not supposed to happen this way!

18:30.539 --> 18:32.440
- Wait, where's Bryan?
- We gotta go back!

18:32.474 --> 18:35.443
You got... they're gonna
kill her, you bastards!

18:35.477 --> 18:37.378
Stand by.

18:45.721 --> 18:47.355
Mattie, it's all right. Let's go.

18:47.389 --> 18:49.223
Hey, no! Run to me!

19:04.806 --> 19:06.707
Hey.

19:06.741 --> 19:09.976
- Where are they taking her?
- He... he'll kill you for this.

19:10.011 --> 19:12.114
Who?

19:17.584 --> 19:18.735
Him?

19:19.654 --> 19:20.922
Tom?

19:28.681 --> 19:30.763
Hey, it's me. Where you At?

19:31.532 --> 19:33.321
Chuck, you there?

19:34.702 --> 19:37.138
Chuck? You there?

19:37.672 --> 19:38.672
Chuck?

19:48.382 --> 19:49.850
Zero, this is Bravo.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.918
Got a cleanup situation back here.

19:51.953 --> 19:54.755
Moving out now... loading dock.

19:57.677 --> 19:59.809
_

20:00.628 --> 20:01.928
Okay...

20:02.048 --> 20:03.425
_

20:03.965 --> 20:06.420
Charles Solitzki... hang on...

20:07.401 --> 20:11.838
Ex-cop... Milwaukee PD...
And brother of Tom Solitzki.

20:11.873 --> 20:13.874
- Know who that is?
- Chief of security

20:13.908 --> 20:16.376
at Ingersol Pharmaceuticals.

20:16.410 --> 20:19.146
If she's dead, it's on you.

20:19.266 --> 20:20.814
So you just wanna give up?

20:20.848 --> 20:22.983
He's just thinking out
loud. I'd do the same.

20:23.017 --> 20:25.952
- What happened in that place?
- I need the code...

20:26.545 --> 20:28.722
The access code to the laptop.

20:28.756 --> 20:32.692
- Your people screwed up.
- I screwed up... just me.

20:32.727 --> 20:34.694
- And now she is dead.
- Dan, you cannot...

20:34.729 --> 20:37.130
Yeah, I can blame anybody I like.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.404
So now Mattie's dead.

20:40.524 --> 20:42.474
She's not an issue anymore.
And now you people

20:42.594 --> 20:44.037
are just gonna go on business
as usual, is that right?

20:44.071 --> 20:45.171
- Wrong.
- No.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.753
Right. 100% right... if she's dead.

20:48.576 --> 20:51.645
It doesn't make any sense
for them to kill her yet.

20:51.679 --> 20:53.449
I'm sorry to put it so bluntly,

20:53.569 --> 20:55.749
because what Ingersol
is paying them to do

20:55.783 --> 20:58.552
is get back the medical
test reports on Sangravan.

20:58.586 --> 21:01.421
Mattie alive is their leverage.

21:01.455 --> 21:03.835
This is a multi-billion
dollar corporation

21:03.955 --> 21:05.265
with everything to lose.

21:05.385 --> 21:07.694
She is their only hope for survival.

21:12.633 --> 21:13.900
Make the call.

21:23.277 --> 21:25.745
Where the hell are you At?

21:25.780 --> 21:27.450
Mr. Solitzki.

21:28.282 --> 21:29.950
Who's this?

21:29.984 --> 21:32.619
I'm afraid your brother's dead,

21:32.653 --> 21:34.517
so I grabbed his phone.

21:36.090 --> 21:38.517
I also have the laptop...

21:39.961 --> 21:41.695
And the code.

21:45.633 --> 21:47.133
What do you want?

21:47.168 --> 21:48.841
Is Mattie there?

21:48.961 --> 21:52.706
Mr. Golitzki, this is her
father, Dan... Dan Glynn.

21:52.740 --> 21:54.474
Is Mattie alive?

21:59.680 --> 22:01.781
Put the other guy back on.

22:03.851 --> 22:06.486
- I'm here.
- You killed my brother?

22:10.758 --> 22:12.138
Yes.

22:13.928 --> 22:16.796
Dad! Dad, I'm all...

22:16.831 --> 22:18.138
Dad...

22:18.258 --> 22:20.667
What just happened here?
What happened here?

22:20.701 --> 22:22.510
What just happened? Mattie!

22:22.630 --> 22:23.630
Mattie!

22:23.871 --> 22:25.244
Mattie!

22:26.807 --> 22:29.058
The one who killed my brother...

22:29.844 --> 22:33.501
You're gonna bring me the
laptop at first light.

22:34.327 --> 22:36.816
You, and only you.

22:38.286 --> 22:40.687
- Where?
- There... right there...

22:40.721 --> 22:43.690
The underpass between
Junction 9 and 10 on 395.

22:45.993 --> 22:47.928
- _
- How long to first light?

22:47.962 --> 22:50.096
You got just about nine hours.

22:52.384 --> 22:55.035
Thanks for letting me
stay at your place, Bryan.

22:55.069 --> 22:57.237
I'd have been pretty mad if you hadn't.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.715
Hi-tech, huh?

23:08.749 --> 23:10.216
You'd be surprised.

23:10.251 --> 23:12.986
Last thing they expect.
Gives you more time.

23:13.020 --> 23:14.301
To what?

23:14.755 --> 23:16.790
Get away... whatever.

23:16.824 --> 23:19.359
Have you been broken into before?

23:19.393 --> 23:20.827
- No.
- Oh.

23:20.861 --> 23:23.832
Um... knock on wood.

23:26.734 --> 23:28.001
You should take the bedroom.

23:28.035 --> 23:29.736
Uh, I'm... I'm good with the couch.

23:29.770 --> 23:31.938
Guard dog sleeps by the door.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.842
Under no circumstances do you push this

23:35.876 --> 23:38.645
any further than exchanging
the laptop for Mattie.

23:38.679 --> 23:39.813
Clear?

24:22.423 --> 24:23.990
Laptop, please.

24:39.273 --> 24:40.930
Step back.

24:41.842 --> 24:43.109
Further.

24:54.989 --> 24:56.456
Where's the girl?

25:09.370 --> 25:11.271
You'll need the access code.

25:11.305 --> 25:14.074
- Which is?
- Not until I have the girl.

25:19.113 --> 25:21.981
Let's go.

25:29.323 --> 25:31.227
Both hands to the bar.

25:38.232 --> 25:42.302
- How far are we going?
- Cuff your wrists to the bar.

26:28.249 --> 26:30.250
- _
- Oh, okay...

26:30.284 --> 26:31.992
Not too far.

27:10.624 --> 27:13.226
- On site?
- Yeah.

27:13.260 --> 27:14.494
ETA.

27:16.530 --> 27:18.364
All good. Yeah, we got it.

27:19.366 --> 27:21.301
You got the code?

27:21.335 --> 27:23.970
- No.
- Why not?

27:24.004 --> 27:26.239
He says not until he gets the girl.

27:26.273 --> 27:27.974
Bring him up.

27:28.008 --> 27:29.375
Okay.

27:33.380 --> 27:36.182
- He says to bring you up.
- How many men?

27:36.216 --> 27:38.084
I don't recall.

27:39.486 --> 27:40.588
Four...

27:41.889 --> 27:43.323
Four men.

28:20.928 --> 28:23.863
Try not to shake the car too much.

28:23.897 --> 28:26.032
You got about three minutes
before the cigarette

28:26.066 --> 28:28.968
burns down enough to fall into the tank.

29:19.253 --> 29:21.205
Now he's not answering.

29:42.869 --> 29:44.858
Something's wrong. Wait here.

30:38.165 --> 30:40.664
He's here. Take the gag off.

30:43.337 --> 30:46.172
- Let's go.
- Who's here? My dad?

30:46.206 --> 30:47.653
Dad?

30:48.375 --> 30:51.043
Dad, I'm up here! I'm okay!

30:51.078 --> 30:52.378
I'm up here, Dad!

30:54.414 --> 30:57.116
Dad! Please!

30:57.150 --> 30:59.151
Please, somebody help me!

30:59.186 --> 31:01.694
Dad! Dad, help!

31:26.079 --> 31:27.480
Dad!

31:28.115 --> 31:30.049
Dad, I'm up here!

31:43.630 --> 31:44.955
Dad!

31:45.781 --> 31:46.866
Dad!

31:51.305 --> 31:53.431
Help! Dad, help!

31:54.441 --> 31:56.208
Dad!

31:57.611 --> 31:59.712
Someone help me!

32:45.826 --> 32:48.878
No, please... don't run
away from me this time.

32:50.497 --> 32:53.733
- Are you a friend of...
- Your dad's? Yes.

32:53.767 --> 32:56.636
- You a gymnast?
- Ballet.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.170
Where's my dad?

32:58.205 --> 33:00.417
So you have her now.

33:01.341 --> 33:02.942
Where's what I need?

33:02.976 --> 33:04.543
Stay close to me.

33:06.313 --> 33:08.381
- Downstairs.
- Where?

33:10.517 --> 33:12.418
Behind some construction equipment.

33:12.452 --> 33:14.330
Narrow it down for me.

33:15.489 --> 33:16.956
I think I saw some welding gear.

33:24.531 --> 33:25.765
Ah!

33:45.652 --> 33:47.887
- You ready?
- Not really.

34:07.908 --> 34:09.875
You stay down.

34:24.791 --> 34:26.726
Listen up...

34:26.760 --> 34:29.895
I need that laptop and access code.

34:31.732 --> 34:33.399
Don't move.

35:03.292 --> 35:05.660
- Mattie!
- Dad?

35:09.365 --> 35:11.686
Oh, baby.

35:12.290 --> 35:13.601
Oh, baby.

35:13.636 --> 35:15.403
I'm so sorry, Dad.

35:15.437 --> 35:17.405
I'm so sorry.

35:17.439 --> 35:18.907
I'm sorry, baby.

35:18.941 --> 35:20.875
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.810
I'm so sorry.

35:25.814 --> 35:27.549
What for?

35:30.986 --> 35:32.887
I love you so much.

35:33.789 --> 35:35.590
He says you're brave, Dad.

35:35.624 --> 35:37.659
- Who?
- Him.

35:40.329 --> 35:41.696
Bryan.

35:54.343 --> 35:58.313
15% of all patients,
all of them military...

35:58.347 --> 36:00.548
Some in-country, some stateside,

36:00.583 --> 36:03.384
some still serving, some veterans...

36:03.419 --> 36:06.821
All suffered massive stroke as
a direct result of Sangravan.

36:06.855 --> 36:09.757
Which was sold to the Defense Department

36:09.792 --> 36:12.560
as a blood clotting agent
to stop the bleeding.

36:12.595 --> 36:14.662
Ingersol hid the side effects.

36:14.697 --> 36:17.435
And I quote... "in some,
but not all cases,

36:17.555 --> 36:19.993
SHV-9876 Sangravan

36:20.113 --> 36:22.971
is known to accelerate
pulmonary embolism,

36:23.005 --> 36:25.940
and/or CVA...
cerebrovascular accident... "

36:25.975 --> 36:28.676
Which, in plain English, means stroke...

36:28.711 --> 36:30.097
"and death."

36:31.113 --> 36:33.648
Some of the cases were
more or less immediate,

36:33.682 --> 36:36.484
and for others, the side effects
accumulated over time.

36:36.518 --> 36:37.819
It's all here.

36:37.853 --> 36:40.098
Defense Department reports on Sangravan

36:40.218 --> 36:41.489
mention none of this.

36:41.523 --> 36:43.358
Then that's an internal issue in defense

36:43.392 --> 36:45.185
that needs to be resolved.

36:45.305 --> 36:48.496
Wouldn't you agree, Madam Secretary?

36:48.530 --> 36:50.999
- I would.
- In the meantime,

36:51.033 --> 36:53.145
we now have the head of the snake.

36:53.265 --> 36:55.103
We are now outside the
Corporate Headquarters

36:55.137 --> 36:58.439
of Ingersol Pharmaceuticals,
where federal agents have made

36:58.474 --> 37:01.442
multiple arrests of senior management.

37:01.477 --> 37:04.932
Would you give us an answer?
Comment about Sangravan.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.188
Screen door needs some oil, Daddy.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.378
She would be...

37:53.562 --> 37:55.530
So proud of you, honey.

38:00.769 --> 38:02.904
Trying to get me drunk, are ya?

38:06.775 --> 38:08.043
Slainte.

38:35.637 --> 38:37.939
- Who is it?
- Me...

38:37.973 --> 38:39.173
Bryan.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.778
Wow, it actually works.

38:43.812 --> 38:45.113
Told you.

38:45.147 --> 38:47.722
Hey, nice suit.

38:48.784 --> 38:50.048
Thanks.

38:50.819 --> 38:52.787
I made dinner...

38:52.821 --> 38:54.789
To say thank you.

38:54.823 --> 38:56.557
You didn't have to do that.

38:56.592 --> 38:59.127
How I was raised. Sorry.

39:03.832 --> 39:05.552
Shepherd's pie?

39:06.168 --> 39:08.002
Hope I got it right.

39:08.036 --> 39:09.796
How did you, uh...

39:10.672 --> 39:13.459
- How... how did you know?
- Your mother.

39:14.176 --> 39:15.287
Oh...

39:17.613 --> 39:18.613
Huh.

39:19.181 --> 39:20.648
That a problem?

39:20.682 --> 39:22.116
What else do you two talk about?

39:22.151 --> 39:24.707
Nothing. This and that.

39:25.988 --> 39:27.173
Cali.

39:33.695 --> 39:35.997
Mind if I... I get out
of this thing first?

39:37.966 --> 39:40.097
- Are you mad at me?
- No.

39:41.036 --> 39:42.644
You seem upset.

39:43.138 --> 39:45.225
I'm just...

39:45.960 --> 39:48.609
It's been a long couple of days.

39:48.644 --> 39:50.978
I wanted to do something nice for you.

39:51.013 --> 39:52.547
Which...

39:52.581 --> 39:54.288
It's not necessary.

39:54.850 --> 39:56.334
What are you afraid of?

39:57.686 --> 39:59.780
- Afraid?
- Bryan...

40:00.338 --> 40:03.183
I bought dinner, I spent
half the day cooking it,

40:03.303 --> 40:05.759
I got dressed up, and I lit candles.

40:07.696 --> 40:10.031
Do I really have to
spell it out for you?

40:13.902 --> 40:15.536
And now you're mad.

40:15.571 --> 40:16.913
No.

40:17.339 --> 40:18.553
What then?

40:19.875 --> 40:21.355
Nervous.

40:23.579 --> 40:24.579
Me too.

40:28.717 --> 40:30.736
This nervous?

40:33.255 --> 40:34.437
Close.

40:52.274 --> 40:54.942
Elena, ahora qué?

40:59.948 --> 41:02.884
I could finish him off...
right here, right now.

41:02.918 --> 41:04.185
No.

41:04.219 --> 41:06.287
First, we use him to find Mejia.
