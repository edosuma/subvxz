00:03.782 --> 00:06.695
Well thank you for dinner dad.

00:06.814 --> 00:09.174
You're welcome.

00:10.495 --> 00:12.521
Take this, I'm the only one
at home.

00:12.641 --> 00:14.744
No, no. Ema won't eat it.
She's on this gluten free thing.

00:59.731 --> 01:02.300
Ian? Oh, my God.

01:03.936 --> 01:05.736
Hello, there.

01:14.179 --> 01:15.646
What if I had someone here?

01:15.681 --> 01:16.881
Do you?

01:16.915 --> 01:17.882
No.

01:17.916 --> 01:19.217
Then we're in luck.

01:23.822 --> 01:26.557
Oh, where've you been?

01:26.592 --> 01:28.025
I'm here now.

01:38.003 --> 01:39.303
Jane.

01:39.338 --> 01:41.172
Ooh!

01:43.175 --> 01:44.308
Hey.

01:44.343 --> 01:45.910
What do we got?

01:45.944 --> 01:48.279
Father and son. Son's
on the way to the hospital.

01:48.313 --> 01:51.082
That's the dad.
Looks like a mugging gone wrong.

01:51.116 --> 01:53.184
- You limping?
- What? No.

01:53.218 --> 01:54.619
Waiter I.D.'d them.

01:54.653 --> 01:56.921
Dead guy is Evan Dunbar,
son is Chris.

01:56.955 --> 01:58.756
They had dinner,
left the restaurant together.

01:58.790 --> 02:00.157
Huh. Did you talk
to the son?

02:00.192 --> 02:02.159
No. He was unconscious
when they rolled him out.

02:02.194 --> 02:04.195
Mugger pistol-whipped
and kicked him.

02:04.229 --> 02:06.831
Manager says the father's
a regular, always carries cash.

02:06.865 --> 02:08.098
He had a wad when he paid.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.866
That'd make him a target.

02:09.901 --> 02:11.969
This street is junkie central
after dark. Where is Maura?

02:12.004 --> 02:14.105
Can't do this without your BFF?

02:14.139 --> 02:17.742
Well, not when she's
the Chief Medical Examiner, no.

02:18.877 --> 02:21.212
Head shot's
did you get the bullet?

02:21.246 --> 02:23.080
CSRU recovered it.
It's on its way to ballistics.

02:23.115 --> 02:24.248
Looked like a .38.

02:24.283 --> 02:26.050
Dispatcher's already called
Dr. Isles.

02:26.084 --> 02:27.718
I don't know.
I'm gonna call the C.I.

02:27.753 --> 02:29.153
He knows this neighborhood
real well.

02:29.187 --> 02:32.156
♪ <i>You're the one</i>
<i>I've waited for</i> ♪

02:32.190 --> 02:34.258
Hel-l-lo, Vanilla.

02:34.293 --> 02:35.793
Hey! Here!

02:38.764 --> 02:39.931
This friggin' guy.

02:41.733 --> 02:44.001
Hey, hey, hey.
That's far enough.

02:44.036 --> 02:45.202
Sam, it's all right.
He's with us.

02:45.237 --> 02:46.203
Come on, Rondo.

02:46.238 --> 02:47.672
Watch your head, chief.

02:47.706 --> 02:49.040
You just step this way.

02:49.074 --> 02:51.742
I will step anywhere
you tell me to step, Vanilla.

02:51.777 --> 02:53.878
- You are lookin' fine, today.
- Come on. Just...

02:53.912 --> 02:55.212
I like it when
you hold me tight.

02:55.247 --> 02:56.781
Stop it. This ain't a date,
all right?

02:56.815 --> 02:57.882
I need some information.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.050
I got lots of information,

02:59.084 --> 03:00.851
and I know how to treat
a lady right.

03:00.886 --> 03:02.753
Shut up, okay?

03:02.788 --> 03:04.355
Just, look.

03:04.389 --> 03:06.190
I need you to be my eyes
and ears on the street, okay?

03:06.224 --> 03:08.326
I need you to be
looking for a junkie

03:08.360 --> 03:11.796
that is newly flush with cash
or bragging about a murder.

03:11.830 --> 03:13.864
I can't hear much with $20.

03:14.700 --> 03:15.900
There.

03:15.934 --> 03:19.103
I think I'm hearing more.

03:19.137 --> 03:22.807
You know what, Rondo? There.
Now, go. Get me something.

03:22.841 --> 03:24.775
Okay. Hey, you get lonely,
you know...

03:24.810 --> 03:26.877
Just go! Just...

03:26.912 --> 03:29.981
- Hey. Where you been?
- Uh, bed.

03:30.015 --> 03:32.283
What? You okay?
Yeah. Why?

03:32.317 --> 03:34.385
'Cause you're wearing
two different shoes.

03:35.378 --> 03:36.628
You're so not feeling okay.

03:36.748 --> 03:37.791
I got dressed in the dark.

03:37.356 --> 03:39.223
What about you?
You're limping.

03:39.343 --> 03:41.292
- No, no. I'm not.
- Yes, you are. Know why?

03:41.326 --> 03:42.893
Because you buy your boots
a half size too small.

03:42.928 --> 03:45.162
- No, I don't.
- And you stomp.

03:45.197 --> 03:46.998
I do not stomp.

03:47.032 --> 03:50.001
The son regained consciousness
at the hospital.

03:50.035 --> 03:52.069
Oh, great.
Let's go.

03:55.140 --> 03:57.274
The guy came out of nowhere.

03:57.309 --> 04:00.678
He slammed his gun
into my face, and...

04:00.712 --> 04:02.313
I blacked out.

04:02.347 --> 04:05.182
It took 22 stitches
to close the gash in his head.

04:05.217 --> 04:06.650
He has a concussion.

04:06.685 --> 04:09.353
He broke his ribs
and his fingers.

04:09.388 --> 04:11.188
My father-in-law...

04:11.223 --> 04:13.257
Do you remember anything
about your attacker?

04:13.291 --> 04:16.861
Race? Height? Regional accent,
a tattoo, anything?

04:16.894 --> 04:19.829
No. It happened so fast.
I--

04:19.865 --> 04:21.932
I didn't even see him.

04:21.966 --> 04:24.835
By the time I came to,
my dad was dead.

04:24.870 --> 04:27.138
The paramedics
were talking to me.

04:27.172 --> 04:30.041
We're very sorry
for your loss.

04:30.075 --> 04:33.744
If you remember anything else,
please give us a call, okay?

04:33.779 --> 04:35.479
Thank you.

04:36.848 --> 04:39.717
Are you going to get the guy
who killed my grandpa?

04:41.019 --> 04:43.387
We're gonna do
everything we can.

04:59.104 --> 05:01.739
No. No.
I'm not ready yet.

05:02.874 --> 05:04.909
It's beautiful.

05:04.943 --> 05:07.411
I bought it for you at
a street market in the Sahel.

05:07.446 --> 05:10.147
- You did not.
- Yes, I did.

05:10.182 --> 05:14.051
Why don't you ever
tell me when you're coming?

05:16.254 --> 05:19.023
Because I never know if I am.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.126
Oh.

05:31.336 --> 05:32.970
Oh, ooh.

05:33.004 --> 05:34.705
Oh. That's
Jane's mother.

05:34.739 --> 05:37.031
- Should I hide?
- Uh, no.

05:37.151 --> 05:38.749
Uh, just say
that we're colleagues.

05:38.869 --> 05:40.411
I don't want to
have to explain you.

05:40.445 --> 05:41.812
I'm hard to explain.

05:41.847 --> 05:43.747
Good morning.

05:43.782 --> 05:45.316
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I didn't know that...

05:45.350 --> 05:47.384
Uh, no, no, no.
It's-- it's okay.

05:47.419 --> 05:49.386
Um, Dr. Faulkner, uh,
was just--

05:49.421 --> 05:51.122
um, he came by for some tea.

05:51.156 --> 05:52.857
Please call me Ian.

05:52.891 --> 05:54.792
Oh. We're just making
some black tea.

05:54.826 --> 05:56.260
- Would you like some?
- Uh, thank you.

05:56.294 --> 05:59.997
You're working early,
Dr. Isles.

06:00.031 --> 06:02.066
We were just, um,
conferring on a case.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.801
Oh, really?
What case is that?

06:03.835 --> 06:06.837
Oh, you know, Angela,
uh, is in the middle

06:06.872 --> 06:11.008
of, um, getting certified to
become a professional organizer.

06:11.042 --> 06:13.410
- Isn't that great?
- That's very impressive.

06:13.445 --> 06:15.980
Well, there's no advancement
in my field

06:16.014 --> 06:17.915
without continuing education.

06:17.949 --> 06:19.116
Uh-huh, what's your field?

06:19.151 --> 06:21.018
I run the police café.

06:21.052 --> 06:23.154
It's disorganized?

06:23.188 --> 06:26.357
Yes. It's, um,
the pantry is a disaster.

06:26.391 --> 06:28.893
- Well, we can't have that.
- No.

06:28.927 --> 06:31.395
Um, I'm gonna be
certified soon,

06:31.429 --> 06:36.066
so if "you're a disorganized,
busy professional..."

06:36.101 --> 06:38.335
You mean, um,
like Dr. Isles, here?

06:38.370 --> 06:42.006
- Yes!
- Shall we start?

06:42.040 --> 06:45.176
"Are you ready to conquer
the clutter?"

06:48.446 --> 06:53.250
Yeah, well, um,
I'm just gonna check "yes."

06:54.553 --> 06:56.120
- Look... stop.
- I don't care what you have to say.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.155
Nah! Nah! I told them.
I'm the one that called it in!

06:58.190 --> 06:59.790
Tell her.
I called it in.

06:59.824 --> 07:02.059
He said he was with
a "Detective Vanilla."

07:02.093 --> 07:04.161
Can't imagine why you didn't
just take his word for it.

07:04.196 --> 07:05.396
It's all right.
He's with us.

07:07.799 --> 07:10.067
He got to be here?

07:10.101 --> 07:11.468
He does.

07:11.503 --> 07:13.237
Talk.

07:13.271 --> 07:15.773
Well, I've been keeping my ear
to the street,

07:15.807 --> 07:17.441
like you told me to,

07:17.475 --> 07:20.778
and I hear about a junkie named
Viper with a bunch of cash.

07:20.812 --> 07:23.080
- That must be Viper.
- That <i>was</i> Viper.

07:23.114 --> 07:25.583
- What do you know about him?
- Dope fiend.

07:27.385 --> 07:28.919
Okay, wait right here.

07:38.230 --> 07:40.431
Hmm. .38 special.

07:40.465 --> 07:42.800
Same caliber as the shooting.

07:42.834 --> 07:44.802
Blood on the barrel.

07:44.836 --> 07:47.171
Probably from pistol-whipping
Chris Dunbar.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.806
I'll take that bet.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.841
He mugs father and son,
uses the cash to buy dope,

07:50.875 --> 07:53.143
and then O.D.'s
at a public picnic table.

07:53.178 --> 07:54.345
What are you thinking?

07:55.614 --> 07:57.181
I'm thinking that's odd,
aren't you?

07:57.215 --> 07:58.382
Yeah.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.351
Junkies don't shoot dope
out in the open.

08:00.385 --> 08:02.253
They're like cockroaches.
They hide.

08:02.287 --> 08:04.955
Something's off.

08:13.497 --> 08:15.498
Ah, we're feeling better.

08:15.532 --> 08:16.599
Your shoes match.

08:16.633 --> 08:18.668
I was just tired last night.

08:18.702 --> 08:20.036
You're still limping.

08:25.175 --> 08:26.742
Who's that?

08:26.777 --> 08:28.511
It's not important.

08:28.545 --> 08:29.645
Oh!

08:29.680 --> 08:30.713
Uh, okay.

08:30.747 --> 08:32.615
Well, can we go out on a limb

08:32.649 --> 08:34.116
and say
that this junkie O.D.'d?

08:34.150 --> 08:35.551
- Yes.
- Really?

08:35.586 --> 08:37.919
Mm-hmm.
He overdosed on heroin.

08:37.955 --> 08:41.524
This is from his syringe.
It tested at almost 80% purity.

08:41.558 --> 08:44.493
80%? That's the good stuff.
Pure, non-cut...

08:44.528 --> 08:47.597
How does a street junkie
get his hands on that?

08:47.631 --> 08:50.669
- I got the print report here.
- Oh, can I see that?

08:52.502 --> 08:55.972
Crime lab says junkie's syringe
had no fingerprints on it.

08:56.006 --> 08:58.874
Died before he had a chance
to wipe them off.

08:58.909 --> 09:01.777
Yeah, so someone
wiped them off for him.

09:04.915 --> 09:07.183
- Well, you didn't even read it that time.
- It's nothing.

09:07.217 --> 09:10.019
You're in a weird mood.

09:10.053 --> 09:11.687
No. I'm not.

09:11.722 --> 09:12.822
Okay.

09:15.025 --> 09:16.425
Oh.

09:16.460 --> 09:17.960
All right.
I got to go talk to my C.I.

09:17.995 --> 09:19.762
You want to grab
a coffee afterwards?

09:19.796 --> 09:21.797
No. I already had tea.

09:24.501 --> 09:25.801
Oh.

09:34.478 --> 09:37.179
Did you meet
Dr. Isles' new hunk?

09:37.214 --> 09:39.048
- What?
- Ian.

09:39.082 --> 09:42.885
They think I was born yesterday.
He spent the night.

09:42.919 --> 09:44.920
Okay, ma, that's really
none of your bus...

09:44.955 --> 09:45.988
Ian spent the night?

09:46.023 --> 09:48.591
Mm-hmm.
Didn't she tell you?

09:48.625 --> 09:49.792
Yeah.

09:49.826 --> 09:51.193
Yes.

09:51.228 --> 09:52.495
Okay, thanks.

09:57.934 --> 09:59.802
Don't they have cappuccinos?

09:59.836 --> 10:01.070
No.

10:01.104 --> 10:02.638
Now tell me about Viper.

10:02.673 --> 10:04.140
Where'd he get pure dope?

10:04.174 --> 10:06.609
Mm. Tastes better
with foamed milk.

10:06.643 --> 10:08.144
Crap.
Buy yourself some foam.

10:08.178 --> 10:10.546
Now... pure dope.

10:10.580 --> 10:13.783
Oh, word is it hit the street
six months ago.

10:13.817 --> 10:15.918
Real good sh-- stuff.

10:15.952 --> 10:17.820
And where's it coming from?

10:17.854 --> 10:19.155
Nobody knows.

10:21.692 --> 10:22.992
All right, um...

10:23.026 --> 10:26.562
You call me if you hear anything,
all right?

10:26.596 --> 10:28.864
I got you on speed dial,
Vanilla.

10:28.899 --> 10:30.533
Okay.

10:30.567 --> 10:33.135
Ballistics confirmed the gun
we found on the dead junkie

10:33.170 --> 10:35.504
was the murder weapon
used to kill Evan Dunbar

10:35.539 --> 10:36.739
and beat up his son, Chris.

10:36.773 --> 10:38.174
Well, what about
gunshot residue?

10:38.208 --> 10:40.176
Did it confirm
that the junkie was the shooter?

10:40.210 --> 10:42.878
No. The opposite. Very little
GSR on the dead junkie.

10:42.913 --> 10:44.847
- So the gun was planted.
- Seems like it.

10:44.881 --> 10:47.249
Well, maybe we're not
looking at a random mugging.

10:47.284 --> 10:49.085
Maybe we're looking at a hit.

10:49.119 --> 10:52.621
What do we know
about the victim's business?

10:52.656 --> 10:55.224
Bostonia Shipping Logistics.
Our victim handled

10:55.258 --> 10:57.927
freight and customs brokering
for small businesses.

10:57.961 --> 11:01.163
- His son, Chris, worked for him.
- Is the company clean?

11:01.198 --> 11:04.100
Very. Checked I.C.E., D.E.A.,
drug control unit.

11:04.134 --> 11:06.869
Nothing.
Not a whiff of anything sketchy.

11:06.903 --> 11:08.637
You said the son, Chris,
worked for the dad?

11:08.672 --> 11:10.773
You think he had someone
beat his face to a pulp?

11:10.807 --> 11:12.141
I don't know. I mean,
father owns the business.

11:12.175 --> 11:14.043
If he dies,
the son inherits it.

11:14.077 --> 11:15.778
So, a few blows to the face.

11:15.812 --> 11:17.947
Dad's a widower,
Chris is an only child.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.816
There's another relative.
Victim had a brother, Arthur.

11:20.851 --> 11:23.486
Well, that's a prison mug shot.
What's he in for?

11:23.520 --> 11:26.055
Mandatory 10 years
for dealing cocaine.

11:26.089 --> 11:28.257
Oh, wait. Look at this.

11:28.291 --> 11:29.892
Company's clean,
but the victim wasn't.

11:29.926 --> 11:31.727
He was indicted
with his brother.

11:31.762 --> 11:33.662
Yeah, but look.
Evan didn't do time.

11:33.697 --> 11:35.531
Because the D.A.
gave him immunity

11:35.565 --> 11:37.700
for testifying
against his brother, Arthur.

11:37.734 --> 11:40.536
Damn. Our victim
put his own brother away.

11:40.570 --> 11:42.104
When does Arthur get out?

11:42.139 --> 11:43.906
Six weeks ago.

11:43.940 --> 11:46.876
Probably pretty pissed off
after 10 years in the slammer.

11:46.910 --> 11:49.678
That's a good motive for murder.
Let's bring him in.

11:49.713 --> 11:52.248
Won't be easy.
Guy's off the grid.

11:52.282 --> 11:55.651
No driver's license, no bank accounts.
Not seeing anything.

11:55.685 --> 11:58.654
Get creative.
We got to find him.

11:58.688 --> 12:03.325
It's Maura.
She got something on the Vic.

12:06.196 --> 12:08.030
Evan Dunbar had an odd residue

12:08.064 --> 12:12.568
on his shoe bottoms and pant
cuffs... cyanoacrylate powder,

12:12.602 --> 12:14.804
used almost exclusively
in nail salons.

12:14.838 --> 12:16.906
So our shooting victim visited a
nail salon before he was killed.

12:16.940 --> 12:19.008
It appears so, although
his nails didn't look like

12:19.042 --> 12:20.910
they've ever been touched
by an emery board.

12:23.647 --> 12:25.114
Is that Ian?

12:29.586 --> 12:33.155
Uh, let's go and take a look
at the victim's nails.

12:33.190 --> 12:34.690
Oh, let's.

12:38.161 --> 12:41.697
Yes, it was Ian.
He's just an old friend.

12:44.301 --> 12:46.936
Hm. His cuticles
have never been cut.

12:46.970 --> 12:49.271
I'd say he's never had
a manicure.

12:49.306 --> 12:51.674
You don't have to tell me
about Ian.

12:51.708 --> 12:53.209
It's none of my business.

12:53.243 --> 12:55.211
I'm not <i>not</i> telling you
about him.

12:55.245 --> 12:57.146
He just stopped by
this morning.

12:57.180 --> 12:59.281
I heard he stopped by
last night.

13:02.319 --> 13:04.787
Uh [Sighs] He lives in Africa.

13:04.821 --> 13:05.821
It's, um...

13:05.856 --> 13:07.089
It's complicated.

13:07.123 --> 13:08.224
Okay.

13:10.227 --> 13:14.597
Uh, let me know
if you find anything else

13:14.631 --> 13:17.032
in the case, you know,
that's not <i>complicated.</i>

13:17.067 --> 13:20.903
I mean, who am I to help you
with your <i>complicated</i> love life?

13:20.937 --> 13:21.770
Jane.

13:25.008 --> 13:26.742
Goodbye.

13:26.776 --> 13:30.246
Have a fabulous time reading
your love texts in private.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.915
No, Jane. Jane, wait. Wait.
It's nothing.

13:32.949 --> 13:34.250
It's nothing. Look.

13:38.989 --> 13:42.691
"Ahune eetepeeah
wesete aberene"

13:44.160 --> 13:46.595
he just said,
"guess what we'd be doing

13:46.630 --> 13:48.664
if we were
in Ethiopia right now."

13:48.698 --> 13:49.798
That doesn't sound complicated.

13:52.002 --> 13:55.804
I killed Korsak with your scalpel.

13:55.839 --> 13:58.641
I contaminated
all your DNA samples.

14:00.010 --> 14:01.243
I snuck into your closet,

14:01.278 --> 14:03.612
and I put all your shoes
in different boxes.

14:03.647 --> 14:04.914
- What?!
- Never mind.

14:04.948 --> 14:05.948
What? No. Jane.
Jane, wait.

14:05.982 --> 14:07.182
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.

14:07.217 --> 14:09.151
Let me at least
take a look at your foot.

14:09.185 --> 14:11.887
Oh, no. I don't think we're
close enough for that anymore.

14:11.922 --> 14:14.890
Please?
I'm... I'm sorry. Okay?

14:14.925 --> 14:16.258
Look, I'm...

14:21.298 --> 14:25.834
You'll <i>really</i> sorry
when my toe kills me.

14:27.704 --> 14:28.671
Okay.

14:28.705 --> 14:30.039
Don't touch it.

14:30.073 --> 14:31.974
Ow! Maura.

14:32.008 --> 14:35.644
Okay, you have
acute onychocryptosis.

14:35.679 --> 14:38.047
Do I need to update my will?

14:38.081 --> 14:41.317
Ingrown toenail.
You need a minor procedure.

14:41.351 --> 14:42.685
Okay, you do it.

14:42.719 --> 14:44.353
Me? I don't do surgery.

14:44.387 --> 14:47.957
It's not a kidney transplant,
Maura. Just do it!

14:51.761 --> 14:52.828
Not gonna ask.

14:52.862 --> 14:54.229
What... is it?

14:54.264 --> 14:55.931
Chris Dunbar
is checking out of the hospital.

14:55.966 --> 14:59.835
How? He was in
critical condition yesterday.

15:01.071 --> 15:02.271
Ow!

15:03.740 --> 15:06.175
Can you believe the insurance
company is kicking him out?

15:06.209 --> 15:08.377
Yeah. They said if I can
get myself to the bathroom,

15:08.411 --> 15:09.912
then I don't need a hospital.

15:09.946 --> 15:10.980
Any news on the case?

15:11.014 --> 15:12.715
We're working some leads.

15:12.749 --> 15:15.117
Your father
ever go to a nail salon?

15:15.151 --> 15:19.989
My father? No. No, he wasn't
that kind of guy. Why?

15:22.125 --> 15:23.659
Come on, Aidan.

15:23.693 --> 15:26.695
Let's go outside.
We'll meet daddy out front.

15:31.401 --> 15:34.703
Did your father and you ever
have any personal difficulties?

15:34.738 --> 15:37.840
No. No,
we always got along.

15:37.874 --> 15:39.775
What about business
disagreements?

15:39.809 --> 15:42.111
Why would you be asking me this?
We were mugged.

15:42.145 --> 15:44.380
It's possible it wasn't random.

15:44.414 --> 15:47.082
Can you think of anyone that might
have wanted to hurt your father?

15:47.117 --> 15:48.884
No. No one.

15:48.918 --> 15:53.089
How about your Uncle Arthur?
Have you seen him recently?

15:53.209 --> 15:54.390
No. I haven't...

15:56.426 --> 15:59.161
I haven't seen my Uncle
since he went to prison.

15:59.195 --> 16:01.163
And did he ever threaten
your father?

16:01.197 --> 16:03.699
I mean, they had
their issues, but no.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.401
I mean, I--
I don't believe

16:05.435 --> 16:08.070
Arthur would kill
his brother or hurt me.

16:08.104 --> 16:09.371
There's... just no way.

16:09.406 --> 16:10.706
Thank you.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.041
Take good care of yourself.

16:12.075 --> 16:13.409
- We'll be in touch.
- Thanks.

16:15.011 --> 16:17.980
Pretty crummy insurance, just
throwing him out in that condition.

16:18.014 --> 16:20.716
Well, he has minimal coverage,
but he's covered till tomorrow.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.384
Why'd his doctors
release him, then?

16:22.419 --> 16:24.353
They didn't.
He's leaving A.M.A.

16:24.387 --> 16:25.754
Against medical advice.

16:25.789 --> 16:27.990
So why'd he lie?

16:28.024 --> 16:30.325
Yeah, and why is he
in such a hurry to get out?

16:30.360 --> 16:31.360
Thank you.

16:35.504 --> 16:37.371
I had a mani-pedi once.

16:37.406 --> 16:38.873
So <i>you're</i> <i>that kind of guy.</i>

16:40.108 --> 16:41.742
Had to get close
to a drug dealer

16:41.777 --> 16:44.178
who did business
over pedicures... got a fungus!

16:45.347 --> 16:47.248
Did you at least
make the arrest?

16:47.282 --> 16:49.417
He got four years.
I got yellow toes.

16:52.521 --> 16:54.188
Here he comes.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.057
What's he doing?

16:56.091 --> 16:57.158
I don't know.

17:02.764 --> 17:04.732
Bye, dad!

17:04.766 --> 17:07.001
He's in a hurry
to go somewhere.

17:31.526 --> 17:33.894
He's pulling a container
out of customs' holding.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.229
Must be pretty important.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.164
Look at the guy.
He's having trouble walking.

17:37.199 --> 17:38.399
Yeah. Something smells.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.301
We got to get a look
in that container.

17:41.336 --> 17:42.803
Hey, Frost.

17:42.838 --> 17:45.005
I need you to get me
a search warrant.

18:12.167 --> 18:14.235
What's going on?

18:14.269 --> 18:15.536
We were gonna ask you
the same thing.

18:16.838 --> 18:18.139
We need to take a look
inside the container.

18:24.379 --> 18:26.280
Jane!

18:26.314 --> 18:28.082
I got the manifest...
Ugh!

18:28.116 --> 18:29.517
Rats! There's
rats in there.

18:29.551 --> 18:31.485
"Ooh, eek! A rat!
Help! Help! Help!"

18:31.520 --> 18:32.820
Stop.

18:32.854 --> 18:34.221
What's the shipment?

18:34.256 --> 18:35.523
Deliveries from China
for four different

18:35.557 --> 18:36.891
Boston customers.

18:36.925 --> 18:38.926
You got a toy store,
jewelry store,

18:38.960 --> 18:40.194
furniture store, and...

18:40.228 --> 18:42.029
"Lee's Nail Spa."

18:42.063 --> 18:45.266
Wow. That's something since our
victim was in a nail salon

18:45.300 --> 18:46.467
before he was killed.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.169
Stay away from nail salons.

18:48.203 --> 18:49.837
Stop talking
about your nasty toes.

18:49.871 --> 18:51.105
At least I'm not afraid
of rodents.

18:51.139 --> 18:52.339
Anything?

18:52.374 --> 18:54.608
Nothing. No drugs.
Damn it.

18:54.643 --> 18:56.610
We got to find time
to go through all the boxes.

18:56.645 --> 18:58.212
I think the clock ran out.

18:58.246 --> 19:00.581
We can't seize the container
without probable cause.

19:00.615 --> 19:02.416
Then we got
to find something fast.

19:05.287 --> 19:08.622
You said that your father
had never been in a nail salon.

19:08.657 --> 19:10.090
Yeah, he hasn't.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.292
All right,
well, one of your clients

19:11.326 --> 19:12.893
owns a nail salon.

19:12.928 --> 19:14.428
You're delivering a shipment
to "Lee's Nail Spa."

19:14.463 --> 19:16.063
Yeah, I don't know
all of our clients.

19:16.097 --> 19:17.965
All right, but I did
just speak to my attorney.

19:17.999 --> 19:20.134
Now, unless you found any drugs,
which you won't,

19:20.168 --> 19:22.102
you need to release
this container back to me.

19:22.137 --> 19:24.638
Port agent says you've never
signed for a container before.

19:24.673 --> 19:26.173
This one must be special.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.875
This business feeds my family,

19:27.909 --> 19:30.377
and now it's all I have left
of my father.

19:30.412 --> 19:32.580
So, yeah, I'm gonna take care
of our clients.

19:32.614 --> 19:34.515
Jane?

19:34.549 --> 19:36.450
Yeah.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.988
I got a whole shipment
of these.

19:41.022 --> 19:42.523
Good, 'cause he's hiding
something.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.291
Nice save, Frost.

19:44.326 --> 19:48.262
These studded bracelets
are illegal in Massachusetts.

19:48.296 --> 19:49.897
So? They're for a shop
in new Hampshire.

19:49.931 --> 19:51.899
Punk rock accessory
in new Hampshire,

19:51.933 --> 19:54.468
dangerous weapon
in Massachusetts.

19:54.503 --> 19:56.670
I'm so sorry. We're gonna have to
impound this entire container.

19:58.340 --> 19:59.940
You gonna hear
from my attorney.

20:02.210 --> 20:05.145
Call CSRU.
We take everything.

20:07.682 --> 20:09.617
What are you doing here?

20:09.651 --> 20:11.318
My toe.
It's killing me.

20:11.353 --> 20:13.654
Unless it's given you
a staph infection,

20:13.688 --> 20:15.222
it's hardly killing you.

20:15.257 --> 20:16.290
What? D...
Oh!

20:16.324 --> 20:18.959
I'm...So sorry
to barge in.

20:18.994 --> 20:20.227
No, it's okay.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.395
Hey, you must be Jane Rizzoli.

20:21.429 --> 20:23.063
Let me get you a glass of wine.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.932
Okay. Thank you.
Uh, you must be Ian.

20:24.966 --> 20:27.234
Jane needs a phenolisation
procedure.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.970
Ooh, then you're gonna want
a lot of wine.

20:30.005 --> 20:32.039
I'd better open another bottle.

20:32.073 --> 20:34.241
Did you come over here
to check up on me?

20:34.276 --> 20:35.976
Oh, yeah, I rubbed bad germs

20:36.011 --> 20:38.512
all over my ingrown toenail
so I could spy on you.

20:38.547 --> 20:40.915
Um, Maura, I can't find
the corkscrew.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.350
Your mother has been doing
some organizing for me.

20:43.385 --> 20:46.086
Oh, God, can't she find
a slob to...

20:46.121 --> 20:47.321
Bother?

20:47.355 --> 20:48.522
I'm so sorry.

20:48.557 --> 20:49.590
It's okay.

20:49.624 --> 20:52.226
She alphabetized everything.

20:52.260 --> 20:55.396
So now corkscrew
is next to the chopsticks.

20:55.430 --> 20:58.198
Hey, um, let me, uh, see
that foot while I open the wine.

20:59.434 --> 21:01.035
Okay.

21:02.203 --> 21:04.338
What can I use
to do the procedure?

21:04.372 --> 21:07.141
Huh? Oh, I-I-- I thought
Maura was gonna do it.

21:07.175 --> 21:09.276
Uh, Ian is much more qualified.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.546
I just got a new pair
of carbon steel pruning sheers.

21:12.581 --> 21:14.715
But would that be under
"c" or "s"?

21:14.749 --> 21:16.717
Uh, "p"?

21:16.751 --> 21:19.587
I guess that makes sense.
"P" for "pruning."

21:19.621 --> 21:22.256
Cute. What, are you
gonna cut off my toe?

21:22.290 --> 21:23.724
It's pretty much the same tool

21:23.758 --> 21:25.159
the podiatrists use.

21:25.193 --> 21:26.994
Okay, so I'm gonna need
some Betadine

21:27.028 --> 21:28.596
and a topical anesthetic spray.

21:31.566 --> 21:33.968
Well, you've got your own
traveling pharmacy over there.

21:34.002 --> 21:37.438
Uh, Ian is taking
some supplies back to Africa.

21:37.472 --> 21:39.173
Oh.

21:39.207 --> 21:43.644
This is gonna feel
a little bit cold.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.746
Oh-kay.
No, that's fine.

21:45.780 --> 21:47.715
Oh, I'll need, uh,
a toothpick, too.

21:47.749 --> 21:49.483
What... what...
What for?

21:49.517 --> 21:51.452
Now hold still 'cause
this might pinch a little bit.

21:52.621 --> 21:54.121
Aaah!

21:54.155 --> 21:56.056
You really got a grip on it,
don't you, doc?

21:57.325 --> 21:59.226
When do I take
the toothpick out?

21:59.260 --> 22:00.461
A day.

22:00.495 --> 22:02.062
It's keeping the nail
away from the wound.

22:02.097 --> 22:03.464
It might smart a little.

22:03.498 --> 22:05.132
No, what, really?

22:05.166 --> 22:07.134
Because you dug into my toe
with pruning sheers?

22:07.168 --> 22:08.535
The periungual's sensitive.

22:08.570 --> 22:11.138
Are you sure you don't want
to stay for dinner?

22:11.172 --> 22:13.073
Um, no, no,
I've lost my appetite.

22:13.108 --> 22:14.441
You two kids have fun.

22:27.232 --> 22:28.799
Thanks, ma.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.135
Oh, hey. You're looking
for Dr. Maura Isles.

22:31.169 --> 22:33.203
Give it to me.
I'll take it to her.

22:35.006 --> 22:36.006
Ma!

22:36.041 --> 22:37.975
What?
It's from Ian.

22:38.009 --> 22:41.712
Wow. Two-buck Chuck
and three rolls of toilet paper.

22:41.746 --> 22:43.280
Romance lives.

22:43.315 --> 22:45.697
She's more secretive about
this one, isn't she?

22:46.208 --> 22:46.924
No.

22:47.452 --> 22:48.819
Yes.

22:48.853 --> 22:50.387
Hurts your feelings

22:50.422 --> 22:53.724
that she's
not confiding in you.

22:53.758 --> 22:55.059
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

22:55.093 --> 22:56.727
I don't care.

22:56.761 --> 22:58.095
You know, I... I don't need
to know <i>every</i> detail

22:58.129 --> 22:59.663
of her personal life.

22:59.698 --> 23:01.765
It's all right.
But she usually tells you.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.400
Yeah.

23:03.435 --> 23:05.135
He seems charming.

23:05.170 --> 23:07.304
But, you know, those are the
ones you have to worry about.

23:09.174 --> 23:11.075
I got a really weird vibe
from him.

23:11.109 --> 23:13.043
He was unpacking boxes.

23:13.078 --> 23:14.678
And then when he saw me,
he just closed 'em all up.

23:14.713 --> 23:16.046
It was like...

23:16.081 --> 23:18.248
That's your cop gut.
Maybe he's a criminal.

23:19.284 --> 23:20.317
I don't know.

23:20.352 --> 23:21.819
Well, he is Australian.

23:21.853 --> 23:23.387
Uh, aren't they all
descended from crooks?

23:23.421 --> 23:25.189
Ma, that was
like 200 years ago,

23:25.223 --> 23:27.157
and I don't think
we can hold that against him.

23:28.426 --> 23:31.328
You know, while I'm
in there organizing,

23:31.363 --> 23:32.896
I could poke around.

23:32.931 --> 23:34.698
Please don't do that.

23:34.733 --> 23:37.267
I hear you loud and clear.
You need deniability.

23:37.302 --> 23:39.370
Ma, no.

23:40.939 --> 23:42.806
No! Wh...

23:42.841 --> 23:43.874
Ma... Maura!

23:46.011 --> 23:47.811
- Maura!

23:47.846 --> 23:49.346
That must be from Ian.

23:49.381 --> 23:52.449
This Ian really knows
how to woo a girl.

23:52.484 --> 23:55.452
When we did relief
work together in Ethiopia,

23:55.487 --> 23:57.254
we'd talk about what we'd give

23:57.288 --> 23:59.356
for some cheap wine
and toilet paper.

23:59.391 --> 24:00.891
How come you never told me
about him?

24:00.925 --> 24:03.127
I'm sure I have.
You must've forgotten.

24:03.161 --> 24:05.896
Thanks for this.

24:07.365 --> 24:08.966
What's up?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.734
Chris Dunbar's not happy
we impounded his shipment.

24:10.769 --> 24:12.169
He's threatening legal action
if we don't release it.

24:12.203 --> 24:14.938
Any luck
finding Uncle Arthur?

24:14.973 --> 24:16.340
Nothing from Social Security.

24:16.374 --> 24:17.941
No phone,
not any paying utilities.

24:17.976 --> 24:19.476
Well, what about a...
A... a discount card,

24:19.511 --> 24:21.345
a pharmacy,
a sweepstakes entry?

24:21.379 --> 24:22.780
Everybody signs up
for something.

24:22.814 --> 24:24.915
I'll keep digging.

24:24.949 --> 24:27.751
So we're back
to that one lead... nails.

24:27.786 --> 24:31.088
Well, we know our victim was in
a nail salon before he died.

24:31.122 --> 24:33.490
And we know he shipped supplies
for Lee's Nail Spa.

24:33.525 --> 24:36.393
Let's go talk to "Lee."

24:41.399 --> 24:45.235
Yes, that's Mr. Dunbar.

24:45.270 --> 24:46.403
We wondered what happened
to our supplies.

24:46.438 --> 24:48.105
And you two
are business partners?

24:48.139 --> 24:49.773
How long have you been using
his shipping service?

24:49.808 --> 24:52.409
A few years.
Good prices, reliable.

24:52.444 --> 24:54.845
He was a nice man.
Your supplies come from China?

24:54.879 --> 24:57.848
Yes, uh, you'd be amazed
what the profit margin is

24:57.882 --> 24:59.249
on hand oils and candles.

24:59.284 --> 25:00.484
I bet.

25:00.518 --> 25:03.120
Excuse me.
Mani-pedi today?

25:05.323 --> 25:07.224
Handy we both have
toe problems.

25:07.258 --> 25:08.459
We're in a nail salon.

25:08.493 --> 25:10.494
How about
a complimentary service?

25:11.830 --> 25:13.964
No, sorry. We're not allowed
to accept gifts.

25:13.998 --> 25:16.100
And plus my friend here
had a bad experience.

25:16.134 --> 25:17.835
Fungus.

25:17.869 --> 25:19.336
Ah, gives the industry
a bad name.

25:19.370 --> 25:20.804
I've tried everything...

25:20.839 --> 25:23.006
Mouthwash, vapor rub,
hemorrhoid cream.

25:23.041 --> 25:25.142
- R-- hemorrhoid cream?
- I'd do anything to get rid of it.

25:25.176 --> 25:27.811
So you can wear
your strappy sandals?

25:27.846 --> 25:30.748
Use this, three times a day.

25:30.782 --> 25:33.117
112 bucks?!
Small price to pay.

25:34.819 --> 25:37.020
Rizzoli.

25:37.055 --> 25:39.323
Never doubt the
power of greed.

25:39.357 --> 25:41.859
- I never do. Did you find Uncle Arthur?
- You were right.

25:41.893 --> 25:44.194
He filled out a Publisher's
Clearing House entry.

25:44.229 --> 25:45.496
Gave them his work address.

25:50.335 --> 25:53.470
Evan's dead?
What happened?

25:53.505 --> 25:55.105
Where were you
two nights ago around 9:00 P.M.?

25:55.140 --> 25:57.175
I was working here.
My shift ends at 11:00.

25:57.295 --> 25:58.565
What happened to my brother?

25:58.685 --> 26:00.672
We were hoping you
may have had a thought.

26:01.146 --> 26:03.981
- No, we really haven't been in touch.
- Since he testified against you.

26:04.015 --> 26:05.783
I don't harbor hard feelings.

26:05.817 --> 26:08.085
But you didn't reach out to him
after 10 years in prison.

26:08.119 --> 26:09.453
I was going to.

26:09.487 --> 26:11.789
I just needed to get
my feet on the ground.

26:11.823 --> 26:13.090
You know...

26:13.124 --> 26:16.393
Evan was the responsible one.

26:16.427 --> 26:20.864
He took over the business
when dad died.

26:20.899 --> 26:22.166
He worked hard.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.234
He found a way to make
a little profit.

26:24.269 --> 26:26.937
But not a big enough profit.
Is that when the two of you

26:26.971 --> 26:28.405
- started dealing coke?
- Evan had nothing to do with that.

26:28.439 --> 26:30.440
But he
testified against you.

26:30.475 --> 26:32.109
Seems like that might
have made you angry.

26:32.143 --> 26:35.445
He had no choice, okay?
I told him to.

26:35.480 --> 26:38.048
What about your nephew? When's
the last time you saw Chris?

26:38.082 --> 26:39.850
I'm a convicted drug dealer.

26:39.884 --> 26:42.986
I figured a little distance
was good for everybody.

26:44.289 --> 26:46.123
Now it's too late.

27:42.013 --> 27:43.947
This is the last
of the container.

27:43.982 --> 27:45.616
They've been through
everything.

27:45.650 --> 27:47.251
More rats.

27:47.285 --> 27:49.453
So we have no evidence,

27:49.487 --> 27:51.154
and our best suspect,
Uncle Arthur,

27:51.189 --> 27:52.389
has three witnesses

27:52.423 --> 27:54.491
who put him
at his auto repair job

27:54.525 --> 27:55.659
at the time of the murder.

27:55.693 --> 27:56.994
Their coats are glossy.

27:59.397 --> 28:01.098
Healthy gums.

28:01.132 --> 28:02.432
They ate rat poison, Maura.

28:02.467 --> 28:04.301
No, this isn't
from rodenticide.

28:04.335 --> 28:07.371
Even fast-acting poison
takes a few days.

28:07.405 --> 28:10.040
These rats died immediately
after ingesting something.

28:10.074 --> 28:13.310
Something in the container.

28:13.344 --> 28:15.479
Maybe you should do an autopsy.

28:19.183 --> 28:21.952
Technically, it's a necroscopy.

28:21.986 --> 28:23.587
Well, let's not tell
the taxpayers

28:23.621 --> 28:25.956
what we're doing
with their tax dollars.

28:25.990 --> 28:27.524
Got another delivery
for you, doc.

28:27.558 --> 28:29.226
Uh, can you put it
in my office, please?

28:29.260 --> 28:31.061
Sure.

28:31.095 --> 28:32.496
What is that?

28:32.530 --> 28:34.031
Supplies.

28:34.065 --> 28:35.933
For Ian?

28:35.967 --> 28:37.567
Yes.

28:37.602 --> 28:38.602
For Ian...

28:38.636 --> 28:40.304
Who fixed your toe.

28:40.338 --> 28:41.972
How is your toe?

28:42.006 --> 28:43.240
How is your conscience?

28:43.274 --> 28:45.509
Excuse me?

28:45.543 --> 28:48.211
What are you doing?
Who <i>is</i> this guy?

28:48.246 --> 28:49.513
Why are you being so weird?

28:49.547 --> 28:52.282
Why are you turning
into a snoopy dog?

28:52.317 --> 28:57.120
Do you mean Snoop Dogg
or Snoopy, the dog?

28:57.155 --> 28:58.188
Either way, I'm insulted.

28:58.222 --> 29:00.057
Too insulted

29:00.091 --> 29:01.591
to find out
what killed your rats?

29:01.626 --> 29:05.195
Okay, that is <i>so</i> not fair.

29:16.474 --> 29:19.676
High levels of diacetylmorphine
in the rats' blood.

29:19.711 --> 29:22.245
Heroin.
The rats O.D.'d.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.548
I've heard of cases
where smugglers

29:24.582 --> 29:25.749
soak clothes in liquid heroin.

29:25.783 --> 29:28.085
Both rats
had grayish blue fibers

29:28.119 --> 29:29.653
in their stomachs.

29:32.223 --> 29:34.758
They ate the blankets
in the container.

29:34.792 --> 29:36.259
How much do you want to bet

29:36.294 --> 29:37.527
this thing
is soaked in liquid heroin?

29:37.562 --> 29:39.997
Nothing.
I don't bet if I can't win.

29:40.031 --> 29:43.233
But why didn't the drug dog
hit on the scent?

29:43.267 --> 29:45.469
Because the scent of any animal
would throw the dogs off.

29:45.503 --> 29:47.070
So fill the container
with rats.

29:47.105 --> 29:48.638
Smart.

29:48.673 --> 29:52.342
I bet Chris Dunbar
thought he'd figured out

29:52.377 --> 29:55.145
how to smuggle heroin
into the country.

30:00.940 --> 30:02.474
- I want my lawyer.
- Better be a good one.

30:02.508 --> 30:04.209
We just found $2 million
worth of heroin

30:04.243 --> 30:05.444
in your container.

30:05.478 --> 30:07.479
- You don't understand.
- So explain.

30:07.513 --> 30:09.448
Start with your father's murder

30:09.482 --> 30:11.516
and finish when you get to the
part about the dead junkie.

30:11.551 --> 30:12.918
I get a phone call.

30:12.952 --> 30:14.119
I want to talk to my lawyer.

30:14.153 --> 30:15.487
Be my guest.

30:19.258 --> 30:20.492
Jane!

30:24.197 --> 30:25.497
Ian is a spy.

30:25.531 --> 30:27.833
What did you do, ma?

30:27.867 --> 30:30.168
I found passports
from different countries

30:30.203 --> 30:35.307
all with his photo
and all with different names.

30:37.977 --> 30:39.311
You shouldn't
have done this, ma.

30:44.584 --> 30:48.053
What is that smell?

30:48.087 --> 30:49.254
It's my foot solution.

30:49.288 --> 30:50.622
Ugh!

30:50.656 --> 30:55.227
It's like a skunk made love
to a farting dog.

30:55.261 --> 30:57.129
Hey, I'm fighting
a war down here.

30:57.163 --> 31:00.165
What is the smell?

31:00.199 --> 31:02.367
Combat under his desk.

31:05.744 --> 31:08.177
Did you poke around
in Chris Dunbar's finances?

31:08.297 --> 31:09.122
Yeah.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.244
Just found a transaction he completed
this morning that makes no sense.

31:12.278 --> 31:14.579
Looks like he took out a line
of credit on his business

31:14.614 --> 31:17.215
- so he could withdraw 2 million bucks.
- Right before we arrested him?

31:17.250 --> 31:18.617
- Yeah.
- Wait. It <i>does</i> make sense.

31:18.651 --> 31:20.619
Heroin we impounded
is worth about $2 million.

31:20.653 --> 31:23.088
Yeah. And if Chris doesn't
deliver the drugs,

31:23.122 --> 31:24.489
he's got to deliver the cash.

31:24.524 --> 31:26.458
Who's his lawyer?
He called him from downstairs.

31:26.492 --> 31:28.927
I'll check the phone records.

31:28.961 --> 31:30.428
Hey.

31:30.463 --> 31:32.964
Can you have your Interpol
contact run these names?

31:32.999 --> 31:34.166
Sure.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.168
Ian Smith.
Ian Walters. Ian Franklin.

31:36.202 --> 31:38.904
Mm. Same guy. I think
he's Australian national.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.372
You think there's an
Australian connection here?

31:40.406 --> 31:42.674
You're not gonna believe this.

31:42.708 --> 31:44.242
Chris didn't call a lawyer.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.377
Who'd he call?

31:45.411 --> 31:47.112
He dialed his own cell.

31:47.146 --> 31:49.915
Well, we better find
who has that phone.

31:49.949 --> 31:50.982
Come on.
We'll take Maura's car.

31:51.017 --> 31:51.983
What's wrong with yours?

31:52.018 --> 31:53.385
It's a cop car.

31:56.422 --> 31:58.623
You're right.

31:58.658 --> 32:01.092
Prius is a great
undercover vehicle.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.561
E.V. mode.

32:02.595 --> 32:05.530
Mm. So quiet I can hear your
toenails crying back there.

32:05.565 --> 32:06.665
Roomy, too.

32:06.699 --> 32:08.400
Well, don't take off
your shoes.

32:10.069 --> 32:12.437
Okay, GPS tracking
shows the phone

32:12.471 --> 32:13.638
is moving down that alley.

32:13.673 --> 32:16.074
It's coming right at us.

32:16.108 --> 32:18.176
My interpol contact
has something for you.

32:18.211 --> 32:19.578
Your Australian is wanted
for questioning.

32:19.612 --> 32:21.079
What?

32:21.113 --> 32:23.648
Hello, Uncle Arthur.

32:23.683 --> 32:27.586
Looks like he's headed
right back to the nail salon.

32:27.620 --> 32:30.021
Take the back.
We'll get the front.

32:50.009 --> 32:51.443
Give me the money!

32:51.477 --> 32:52.644
I don't like this.

32:54.647 --> 32:56.314
Drop the gun!
Now!

32:56.349 --> 32:57.415
Put it down!
Put it down!

33:04.357 --> 33:05.690
Clear!

33:05.725 --> 33:08.560
Frost, get an ambulance.

33:08.594 --> 33:10.095
Victor 810.
I need EMS down here.

33:10.129 --> 33:11.429
It's all right.
It's all right.

33:11.464 --> 33:13.265
Okay, okay. The paramedics
are on their way.

33:13.299 --> 33:15.767
He has Emma and Aidan.

33:15.801 --> 33:17.369
- Chris' wife and son?
- Yes.

33:17.403 --> 33:20.272
- Who has them? Who?
- I don't know.

33:20.306 --> 33:21.673
He killed my brother.

33:23.442 --> 33:25.277
- He wants the money.
- Where are they? Where are they?

33:25.311 --> 33:29.414
She's the only one that knew.

33:33.252 --> 33:35.487
Lee had a business partner.
Ted.

33:35.521 --> 33:37.555
I don't know who Ted is.

33:37.590 --> 33:39.057
All right.
Please, you have to help me.

33:39.091 --> 33:40.558
We cannot find
your wife and child

33:40.593 --> 33:41.693
if you're just gonna sit here

33:41.727 --> 33:43.028
and keep lying to us, Chris.

33:43.062 --> 33:44.696
All right. Wait.

33:44.730 --> 33:46.831
Wait.

33:49.335 --> 33:51.202
How long have
you and your father

33:51.237 --> 33:54.139
been moving heroin
in those containers?

33:54.173 --> 33:56.508
He had nothing to do with it.

33:56.542 --> 33:58.076
All right, it was all me.

33:58.110 --> 33:59.611
Right, and
it was just this one time.

33:59.645 --> 34:00.812
And Lee was your connection?

34:00.846 --> 34:03.114
Yeah.

34:03.149 --> 34:05.317
My father introduced me
to all of his clients.

34:05.351 --> 34:09.754
And Lee, she said
that she had a way

34:09.789 --> 34:11.389
for me to make some easy money.

34:11.424 --> 34:12.824
By smuggling dope.

34:12.858 --> 34:15.126
- Yeah.
- Yeah, as you can see, a real easy way

34:15.161 --> 34:16.328
to make a couple million bucks.

34:16.362 --> 34:17.762
It would have worked, too,

34:17.797 --> 34:21.433
except my father,
he was so precise.

34:21.467 --> 34:23.768
He noticed on the manifest

34:23.803 --> 34:25.570
that the container from China
was off by 50 pounds.

34:25.603 --> 34:28.672
Because you put 50 pounds of
heroin-soaked blankets inside.

34:28.708 --> 34:30.442
We found some residue
from the nail salon

34:30.476 --> 34:31.710
on your father's clothing.

34:31.744 --> 34:32.811
He went to see Lee

34:32.844 --> 34:34.145
the day he was shot, didn't he?

34:34.179 --> 34:37.415
Yeah.
I told him not to go.

34:37.449 --> 34:39.384
But he said
that there was no way

34:39.418 --> 34:42.087
that he was gonna accept
delivery of her container.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.556
Well, got him killed.

34:44.590 --> 34:46.291
Maybe you should have
talked to us.

34:46.324 --> 34:47.859
Oh, come on.
I couldn't talk to you.

34:47.893 --> 34:50.495
The guy who shot my dad,
he said I was next

34:50.529 --> 34:52.397
if I didn't get him
the container.

34:52.431 --> 34:53.797
And what did he look like?

34:53.833 --> 34:55.533
I didn't see his face.

34:55.568 --> 34:57.302
I'm telling you the truth!

34:57.336 --> 34:58.770
Did you tell
your Uncle the truth, too?

34:58.804 --> 35:00.572
You nearly got him killed.

35:00.606 --> 35:02.474
He was just trying to help.

35:02.508 --> 35:04.542
All right, I called him
when my family was taken.

35:04.577 --> 35:06.077
All right, I didn't know
what else to do.

35:06.112 --> 35:08.213
Arthur said
that he would do it.

35:08.247 --> 35:12.384
All right, he said that
he would bring Lee the money.

35:12.418 --> 35:14.185
And you let him.

35:14.220 --> 35:18.590
Please, you have to find
my family, right?

35:18.624 --> 35:20.225
They didn't do
anything wrong.

35:23.662 --> 35:25.697
It's Maura.
She says she's got something.

35:33.672 --> 35:37.308
Lee had a poultry mite
infestation on both arms.

35:37.343 --> 35:38.877
Clearly it's a few months old.

35:38.911 --> 35:40.645
How?
She worked in a nail salon.

35:40.679 --> 35:42.514
What, she get it
from a customer?

35:42.548 --> 35:45.316
No. She could only contract it
if she worked around poultry.

35:45.351 --> 35:47.252
- Like a slaughterhouse or a packing plant?
- Maybe there's a slaughterhouse

35:47.286 --> 35:48.989
or a packing plant
next to the nail salon.

35:49.109 --> 35:49.769
Check it, Frost.

35:49.889 --> 35:53.124
Well, she'd need a place
to process the heroin.

35:53.159 --> 35:54.726
Yeah. She'd need
a chemical bath,

35:54.760 --> 35:56.361
a heating source,
drying tables.

35:56.395 --> 35:58.129
Got something.

35:58.164 --> 36:00.398
Only one slaughterhouse
in the Boston area.

36:00.433 --> 36:02.133
Right near the nail salon.

36:02.168 --> 36:03.868
Health department shut it down
six months ago.

36:03.903 --> 36:05.270
Utilities are still on.

36:05.304 --> 36:06.805
Good place
to dry out your heroin

36:06.839 --> 36:08.239
and hide people.

36:08.274 --> 36:11.743
Speaking of hiding,

36:11.777 --> 36:14.879
Ian is wanted for questioning
by interpol for stealing drugs.

36:14.914 --> 36:16.481
You've been investigating me?

36:16.515 --> 36:17.615
Jane.

36:17.650 --> 36:19.284
I'm coming.

37:54.127 --> 37:55.127
Where are they?!

37:55.161 --> 37:56.261
Go to hell.

38:01.367 --> 38:03.168
Let's do it again.
Where are they?!

38:04.704 --> 38:07.806
I'm gonna count to three.

38:07.841 --> 38:09.408
One.

38:09.442 --> 38:11.376
Two.

38:11.411 --> 38:13.112
You don't have the guts.

38:13.146 --> 38:15.147
You don't know her at all.

38:15.181 --> 38:17.149
Three!

38:19.352 --> 38:20.819
In the freezer in the back!

38:21.354 --> 38:23.122
You okay?
They're in the freezer.

38:25.892 --> 38:27.392
Not enough of a profit margin

38:27.427 --> 38:28.927
on hand oils and candles,
huh, Ted?

38:35.969 --> 38:37.903
Emma...

38:38.738 --> 38:40.439
Aidan.

38:40.473 --> 38:43.041
Hey. It's okay.
It's okay.

38:43.076 --> 38:44.409
It's over.

38:44.444 --> 38:46.078
Mommy.
It's okay.

38:46.112 --> 38:48.714
Where's dad?

38:56.723 --> 38:59.691
Hi.
Hi.

38:59.726 --> 39:01.093
You okay?

39:08.168 --> 39:09.835
Where's Ian?

39:11.237 --> 39:15.140
He's gone.

39:15.175 --> 39:16.742
I harbored a fugitive.

39:16.776 --> 39:18.944
So go ahead and arrest me.

39:18.978 --> 39:21.480
I'm sorry.

39:21.514 --> 39:24.483
Because you won't be able
to arrest him?

39:24.517 --> 39:28.086
Man, you got it bad.

39:34.260 --> 39:38.764
You know when people talk
about the loves of their lives?

39:38.798 --> 39:39.965
That's Ian.

39:39.999 --> 39:43.068
You never, ever
mentioned him.

39:43.102 --> 39:46.471
'Cause I try to forget him.

39:49.175 --> 39:50.375
I'm sorry, Maura.

39:50.410 --> 39:51.710
I shouldn't have done
what I did.

39:51.744 --> 39:52.878
It's none of my business.

39:52.912 --> 39:55.981
I just... I can't...

39:56.015 --> 39:58.150
I can't talk about him.

39:59.853 --> 40:02.187
I can't.
With anybody.

40:02.222 --> 40:04.223
Because it makes me so sad.

40:05.959 --> 40:08.293
I mean, how can you...
How can you love someone

40:08.328 --> 40:10.128
and not be able to be
with them?

40:10.163 --> 40:11.496
Well, why can't you
be with him?

40:11.531 --> 40:13.131
Because he went back to Africa.

40:13.166 --> 40:14.800
Well, you could go to Africa.

40:16.169 --> 40:20.205
You know, his crime
is risking his life

40:20.240 --> 40:24.042
to bring drugs
and basic supplies

40:24.077 --> 40:25.377
to places that nobody
cares about.

40:25.411 --> 40:30.115
And I helped him,
so go ahead and arrest me.

40:35.855 --> 40:38.924
The first person
I'm gonna arrest is my mother.

40:38.958 --> 40:42.127
What, really?
"High ball glasses"?

40:42.161 --> 40:43.762
When is the last time
you had a high ball?

40:43.796 --> 40:44.830
Come on.

40:48.401 --> 40:50.836
She rearranged my closet, too.

40:50.870 --> 40:53.272
No.
Not the closet.

40:53.306 --> 40:55.073
She threw away my shoe boxes.

40:55.108 --> 40:57.242
Well, now, that a crime.

40:57.277 --> 40:58.343
I'm sorry.

41:01.247 --> 41:03.248
You want me to take you
to the airport?

41:05.518 --> 41:06.985
No.

41:07.020 --> 41:08.520
No.

41:08.554 --> 41:11.123
You want me to sit with you
till you feel better?

41:11.157 --> 41:13.592
Yeah.

41:15.261 --> 41:17.329
But first can you arrest
your mother?

41:17.363 --> 41:18.964
Okay.

41:22.468 --> 41:23.869
Thank you.
