00:51.684 --> 00:53.174
Thank you!

00:53.253 --> 00:55.084
Wow!

00:58.658 --> 01:01.525
Quite the turnout
for a scientific demonstration.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.459
More of a spectacle,
I should say.

01:03.529 --> 01:05.053
Shall we move closer
to the stage?

01:05.131 --> 01:06.063
Yes, of course.

01:06.132 --> 01:08.532
What have you got there?

01:09.936 --> 01:11.335
Are we having a picnic?

01:11.404 --> 01:13.634
Well, I thought
since we are in a park.

01:13.706 --> 01:16.470
First, I'd like to thank
each and every one of you.

01:16.542 --> 01:17.668
People, please stand back.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.939
There's a very dangerous
electrical demonstration

01:20.013 --> 01:20.945
about to take place.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.606
That includes you, miss.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.650
I'm giving him his last meal,
if you don't mind.

01:24.717 --> 01:25.684
Well, I'm going to have
to insist -

01:25.752 --> 01:27.447
They're going to execute him.
Did you know that?

01:27.520 --> 01:28.680
That's not really my -

01:28.755 --> 01:29.983
It's criminal is what it is.

01:30.056 --> 01:31.182
Now, look here, constable.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.588
I'm from
the Toronto Humane Society,

01:32.659 --> 01:34.854
and I demand that you do
something about this.

01:34.927 --> 01:36.451
- Such as?
- Arrest them.

01:37.563 --> 01:38.996
My name is Daniel Pratt.

01:39.065 --> 01:41.533
I'm the owner and manager
of Toronto Electric and Light.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.693
For the last 10 years,

01:42.769 --> 01:44.703
we have been safely lighting
the streets of Toronto

01:44.771 --> 01:45.738
with direct current.

01:45.805 --> 01:47.966
But that contract expires
next year,

01:48.041 --> 01:50.601
and a new and very dangerous
form of electricity

01:50.677 --> 01:52.076
is being considered
by city council.

01:52.145 --> 01:54.579
It's called alternating current,
and it's a killer.

01:54.647 --> 01:56.945
What Mr. Pratt isn't saying,
of course,

01:57.050 --> 01:59.780
is that he's made his entire
fortune off of direct current.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.049
So, this exhibition
is really about money.

02:02.121 --> 02:03.315
And the desire to keep it.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.549
It is up to us,

02:04.624 --> 02:06.592
the responsible citizens
of Toronto,

02:06.659 --> 02:07.648
to not let that happen.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.354
To that end,
I've arranged a demonstration

02:10.430 --> 02:12.022
by Mr. Allen Fawkes,

02:12.098 --> 02:14.225
one of Thomas Edison's
top engineers,

02:14.300 --> 02:16.291
from New York City.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.030
Thank you.

02:18.104 --> 02:19.833
Joining Mr. Fawkes on stage

02:19.906 --> 02:21.635
is Alderman Edwin Dodd,

02:21.708 --> 02:23.198
chairman of
the Street Lighting Commission.

02:24.577 --> 02:26.135
And, of course,

02:26.212 --> 02:28.271
the very lovely Alice Howard,

02:28.348 --> 02:31.511
newly crowned
Miss Toronto Electric and Light.

02:31.584 --> 02:34.678
Mr. Fawkes,
you have the stage, sir.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.449
Thank you, Daniel.

02:36.522 --> 02:37.489
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:37.557 --> 02:41.653
as we speak, a generating plant
is being built at Niagara.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.288
One that will harness
the power of the Falls

02:44.364 --> 02:46.662
and convert it
into alternating current.

02:46.733 --> 02:50.931
Now, Mr. Thomas Edison
has brought electricity

02:51.003 --> 02:52.903
into your homes
via direct current

02:52.972 --> 02:56.703
at 110 volts, the maximum
he considers to be safe.

02:56.776 --> 03:00.712
But these Niagara people would
send their alternating current

03:00.780 --> 03:04.341
into our city at 20,000 volts.

03:07.286 --> 03:08.253
Goodness.

03:08.321 --> 03:09.720
Mere parlor tricks.

03:09.789 --> 03:10.881
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:10.957 --> 03:14.222
we are honored to have
a distinguished visitor

03:14.293 --> 03:15.658
in our midst.

03:15.728 --> 03:18.026
None other than the man
who invented this killer system,

03:18.097 --> 03:19.496
Mr. Nikola Tesla.

03:19.565 --> 03:21.726
That's really him.

03:21.801 --> 03:23.792
You recognize Tesla?

03:23.870 --> 03:26.031
Yes.
He's one of my heroes.

03:26.105 --> 03:29.472
Mr. Tesla, would you
care to step up on the stage?

03:29.542 --> 03:30.600
No?

03:30.676 --> 03:33.975
Perhaps Mr. Tesla realizes
the mistake he has unleashed.

03:34.046 --> 03:35.013
Rubbish.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.412
So that you, too,
are also aware,

03:36.482 --> 03:38.450
I will now demonstrate to you

03:38.518 --> 03:41.112
the dangers
of alternating current.

03:41.654 --> 03:45.784
We are going to pass 1,000 volts
of alternating current

03:45.858 --> 03:48.190
through a living animal.

03:48.261 --> 03:50.821
That's 1/20 of what Mr. Tesla
and his cronies

03:50.897 --> 03:52.990
are proposing to bring
to our city.

03:53.065 --> 03:55.295
This is not a demonstration.

03:55.368 --> 03:56.426
This is an execution.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.902
Now, what did this dog ever do
to deserve this?

03:59.005 --> 04:00.131
Miss, you have to stay back.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.435
They're going to execute
a harmless animal!

04:01.507 --> 04:03.065
- I sympathize, but -
- A harmless animal!

04:03.142 --> 04:04.905
I sympathize, but I can't
let you hurt yourself.

04:04.977 --> 04:06.740
- I can't let that happen.
- I'm sorry.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.440
Ladies, please,
you need to stay back.

04:08.514 --> 04:09.845
They should electrocute you,
Mr. Fawkes!

04:09.916 --> 04:11.349
- Miss, please.
- Miss Howard.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.255
Turn off the power!

04:21.928 --> 04:23.793
Jesus!

04:36.943 --> 04:39.173
It's clearly
a case of electrocution.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.713
Why did the current run
through her and...

04:41.781 --> 04:43.248
Not through the dog.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.648
This is exactly the type
of tragedy you can expect

04:45.718 --> 04:47.151
with these sorts
of high voltages.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.551
It's why I've never made
a secret

04:48.621 --> 04:49.986
of my support
for direct current.

04:50.056 --> 04:53.890
It's safer, and the safety
of my constituents is paramount.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.019
I agree
with Mr. Dodd's sentiments.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.029
In fact, you're safer
cuddling up to a cobra

04:58.130 --> 04:59.654
than to alternating current.

04:59.699 --> 05:03.191
Hey, stop! That's my dog!
What do you think you're doing?

05:03.269 --> 05:05.203
Officer, I want you to arrest
this woman for theft.

05:05.271 --> 05:07.262
And I want you to arrest him
for cruelty to animals.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.672
What, the fifth demonstration
of ours you've tried to disrupt?

05:09.742 --> 05:12.006
Yes! And you shall continue
to see me again and again,

05:12.078 --> 05:13.010
so long as you insist

05:13.079 --> 05:14.876
on executing poor,
defenseless creatures.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.539
Sir, might I have a word?

05:16.616 --> 05:18.641
- That dog belongs to me.
- Absolutely.

05:18.718 --> 05:19.776
However, given the publicity

05:19.852 --> 05:21.285
that may arise
from this incident,

05:21.354 --> 05:25.450
don't you think it wise
to be seen as merciful?

05:25.525 --> 05:29.552
Yes, fine,
let her have the damn thing.

05:31.130 --> 05:32.188
The dog's all yours, ma'am.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.029
Take good care of him,
or I'll have to arrest you.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.467
- Thank you, constable.
- Crabtree.

05:37.537 --> 05:38.868
George Crabtree.

05:38.938 --> 05:41.498
Edna Garrison.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.098
Come on.

05:43.175 --> 05:44.642
Come on.

05:48.781 --> 05:49.975
What's the matter?

05:50.049 --> 05:53.485
Well, the current came
through here.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.043
When she brought
the handle down,

05:55.121 --> 05:57.919
the power should have flowed
through these wires

05:58.024 --> 05:59.787
to the dog.

05:59.825 --> 06:01.884
Unless...

06:01.961 --> 06:03.656
Unless what?

06:16.108 --> 06:17.097
Rubber.

06:17.176 --> 06:20.304
Someone put an insulator
between the contacts,

06:20.379 --> 06:23.348
preventing the handle
from closing the circuit.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.747
So, if the rubber insulator
saved the dog,

06:24.817 --> 06:27.342
why didn't the switch's
rubber handle save Miss Howard?

06:27.420 --> 06:28.409
That's a very good question.

06:28.487 --> 06:30.284
Well, this has
turned into a right cock-up.

06:30.356 --> 06:31.288
What have we got?

06:31.357 --> 06:33.086
Well, we know why the dog
didn't die.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.888
Sod the dog.
What's happened to the girl?

06:34.961 --> 06:36.451
She was electrocuted.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.224
Whether it was intentional
or not -

06:38.297 --> 06:40.060
Are you suggesting murder?

06:40.132 --> 06:42.293
The stakes
are certainly high enough.

06:42.368 --> 06:44.233
You're talking about
the street-lighting contract.

06:44.303 --> 06:47.739
Millions of dollars could be won
or lost, by either side.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.900
But how does this poor dead girl
fit in, then?

06:49.976 --> 06:51.500
That's what I intend
to find out.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.205
Be careful when you go dancing,
Murdoch.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.338
There are some people

06:55.414 --> 06:57.644
who don't like their toes
being stepped on.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.878
Alderman Dodd,
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.081
I can assure you, sir, that
we'll get to the bottom of this.

07:03.155 --> 07:04.782
Well, you bloody better.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.257
This is an outrage.

07:10.429 --> 07:13.296
Why would someone want to tamper
with this switch, Mr. Fawkes?

07:13.366 --> 07:15.334
Clearly, someone was out
to embarrass us.

07:15.401 --> 07:16.629
By killing a young woman?

07:16.702 --> 07:18.192
By causing the demonstration
to fail.

07:18.270 --> 07:20.966
I can't imagine even Tesla
intended his prank to kill.

07:21.040 --> 07:23.008
Why would the inventor
of alternating current

07:23.075 --> 07:25.441
want to discredit
his own invention, Mr. Fawkes?

07:25.511 --> 07:26.500
Because he'd do anything

07:26.579 --> 07:28.877
to undermine Mr. Edison and
direct current, that's why.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.779
The man carries a grudge
like no one I've ever met.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.147
Oh, come, now, Mr. Fawkes.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.776
If anyone stood to gain
from this young woman's death,

07:33.853 --> 07:34.785
it's you.

07:34.854 --> 07:35.786
- Me?
- Yes.

07:35.855 --> 07:36.787
You go around the country

07:36.856 --> 07:38.118
putting on
these dog-and-pony shows

07:38.190 --> 07:40.215
to discredit
alternating current.

07:40.292 --> 07:42.157
Well, I'm convinced.
It's dangerous.

07:42.228 --> 07:43.718
We electrocute dogs, Detective.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.924
A few curs, strays,
to save thousands of lives.

07:46.999 --> 07:49.331
The idea that I would
electrocute an innocent girl

07:49.402 --> 07:51.427
for the sake of publicity,
it's monstrous.

07:51.504 --> 07:52.869
A fortune hangs in the balance,
Mr. Fawkes.

07:52.938 --> 07:53.870
Not my fortune.

07:53.939 --> 07:55.167
Your career, then.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.675
You're barking
up the wrong tree, Detective.

07:57.777 --> 08:00.803
Very well. We shall have to see
where the evidence leads us.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.373
The switch box was stored
at one of my facilities,

08:04.450 --> 08:06.418
but I fail to see
how that matters.

08:06.485 --> 08:08.783
Mr. Pratt, a young woman
was killed today

08:08.854 --> 08:10.617
using equipment stored
in your warehouse

08:10.690 --> 08:12.590
during a demonstration
you helped organize.

08:12.658 --> 08:13.590
Are you implying -

08:13.659 --> 08:15.684
Why are your hands shaking,
Mr. Pratt?

08:15.761 --> 08:18.161
I can't help thinking about
what happened to poor Alice.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.959
Well, then,
for poor Alice's sake,

08:20.032 --> 08:22.432
answer the questions
that are put to you.

08:22.501 --> 08:23.934
Who had access
to the switch box?

08:25.471 --> 08:28.099
Mr. Fawkes, myself,
some of my employees.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.039
- Was it guarded?
- Intermittently.

08:30.109 --> 08:31.303
A night watchman patrols

08:31.377 --> 08:33.072
three of my generating
stations in the East End.

08:33.145 --> 08:34.373
But any effort
to break and enter

08:34.447 --> 08:35.436
would have triggered an alarm.

08:35.514 --> 08:36.538
You have an alarm system?

08:36.615 --> 08:38.775
Designed by no less
than Mr. Thomas Edison himself,

08:38.851 --> 08:40.842
in consultation
with the Pinkerton Agency.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.284
Was an alarm triggered?

08:42.354 --> 08:44.879
Alarm events are recorded in
a log book at the guard station.

08:44.957 --> 08:47.824
George, I need you to fetch
the security logs

08:47.893 --> 08:50.088
for the Toronto Electric
and Light station on Shuter.

08:50.162 --> 08:51.220
- Right away, sir.
- Thank you.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.457
Sir?

08:52.531 --> 08:54.829
I was thinking, what if
the motive behind the tampering

08:54.900 --> 08:56.094
was simply to save the dog.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.194
One of the advocates for the
humane treatment of animals.

08:59.305 --> 09:02.103
Well, I got the sense that their
group leader, Miss Garrison,

09:02.141 --> 09:03.130
was very committed to the cause.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.767
If you thought it worthwhile,
I could drop by...

09:04.844 --> 09:05.936
Excellent idea, George.

09:06.011 --> 09:06.943
Yes, bring her in.

09:07.012 --> 09:09.139
Sir, I was thinking I could
conduct the interview myself,

09:09.215 --> 09:10.273
save you the trouble.

09:10.349 --> 09:11.611
No, no.
Bring her in.

09:11.684 --> 09:14.312
While you fetch her,
I have a call to make.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.737
Hello?

09:35.207 --> 09:37.141
Mr. Tesla?

09:38.811 --> 09:41.177
Hello?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.715
Mr. Tesla?

09:52.224 --> 09:54.488
Hello?

10:06.105 --> 10:08.539
Stop!
Please step out of the circle

10:08.607 --> 10:10.074
and put your left hand
in your pocket.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.710
Sorry.
Potential for great injury.

10:16.782 --> 10:17.714
How?

10:17.783 --> 10:18.909
You are standing

10:18.984 --> 10:21.509
in a high-frequency
electrical field.

10:21.587 --> 10:24.488
That's how a light bulb
can be powered without wires.

10:24.557 --> 10:25.546
But my left hand?

10:25.624 --> 10:27.854
Should the electricity
have entered your left hand,

10:27.927 --> 10:29.861
it would have exited
via your left foot,

10:29.929 --> 10:31.692
passing through and quite
possibly stopping your heart

10:31.764 --> 10:32.696
on its journey.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.232
Ah.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.632
We wouldn't want that now,
would we?

10:36.702 --> 10:40.035
Now, how can I help you?

10:40.105 --> 10:43.802
Mr. Tesla, I'm Detective Murdoch
of the Toronto Police.

10:43.876 --> 10:47.277
Pleased to make your
acquaintance, Detective Murdoch.

10:47.346 --> 10:51.180
Please stand right there
while I transmit my last digits.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.186
Sorry.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.655
Very sorry.
I should have warned you.

10:59.692 --> 11:00.784
Hold on.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.692
Ah, there.

11:07.766 --> 11:09.927
That's it.

11:10.803 --> 11:13.499
Now you can arrest me or do
whatever it is you came to do.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.665
I'm not here to arrest you.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.272
Excuse me.

11:22.781 --> 11:23.770
Yes.

11:25.084 --> 11:27.609
Okay, yes, go.

11:27.686 --> 11:30.246
What great joy!

11:30.322 --> 11:33.155
Thank you, thank you.

11:33.225 --> 11:35.716
That was my laboratory
in New York.

11:35.794 --> 11:37.227
They received my message.

11:37.296 --> 11:42.529
You sent a message to
New York City through the air?

11:42.601 --> 11:44.228
Uh-huh.

11:45.537 --> 11:48.165
The first six digits of pi,
back to front.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.174
My Serbian humor.

11:50.242 --> 11:51.709
How is this possible?

11:51.777 --> 11:54.245
Well, simply modulating
the electrical waves

11:54.313 --> 11:55.780
transmitted and received...

11:55.848 --> 11:57.247
At the same resonant frequency.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.112
Yes, exactly.

11:59.151 --> 12:02.143
A police officer
and a man of science.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.153
Well, I dabble.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.816
But this invention of yours,
imagine the possibilities.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.860
Yes, ships will be able to send
telegrams while at sea.

12:08.928 --> 12:11.158
You could send voice
over airwaves.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.527
Why stop at voice?

12:12.598 --> 12:14.293
If you were to capture an image,

12:14.366 --> 12:15.560
you could modulate the signal

12:15.634 --> 12:17.534
depending on the amount
of light reflected.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.629
- Transmit images.
- Mm-hmm.

12:20.706 --> 12:22.571
You could call it
a telekinetascope.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.108
Too many syllables.

12:24.176 --> 12:26.804
Call it, uh, tele...

12:27.479 --> 12:29.208
...vision.

12:29.281 --> 12:30.248
Huh.

12:30.316 --> 12:33.547
But I have more important things
to do,

12:33.619 --> 12:34.745
as I'm sure you have.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.253
I presume you are here

12:36.322 --> 12:39.314
about the accident
at the demonstration today.

12:39.391 --> 12:41.052
Yes, well, it was no accident.

12:41.126 --> 12:42.889
The switch box
had been tampered with.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.054
Mr. Fawkes suggested

12:44.129 --> 12:47.587
that you might have wanted
to disrupt his demonstration.

12:47.666 --> 12:48.690
Yes, of course, he would.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.359
That's how little imagination
he has.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.461
But please tell Mr. Fawkes
from me

12:52.538 --> 12:54.699
that if I had wanted to disrupt
his silly demonstration,

12:54.773 --> 12:56.570
I would have fired
a million-volt pulse

12:56.642 --> 12:57.574
at his generator,

12:57.676 --> 12:59.405
thereby disabling it.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.936
You could do that?

13:02.014 --> 13:05.279
I would need to build
the prototype first, but, yes.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.876
Ah, well, at any rate,

13:07.953 --> 13:09.818
where were you last night,
Mr. Tesla?

13:09.888 --> 13:13.119
I was dining
with the Serbian consul

13:13.192 --> 13:15.660
who are here to see my work
at Niagara.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.958
Then I spent the night
in my hotel.

13:23.502 --> 13:24.969
Thank you.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.535
Mr. Tesla, I wonder
if you would assist me

13:29.608 --> 13:32.236
in determining
how the victim was killed.

13:32.311 --> 13:35.610
Huh.
Of course, Detective Murdoch.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.946
I have a few meetings
and shall drop by your office.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.349
Station number four.

13:40.419 --> 13:41.545
Great.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.746
Thank you.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.453
Constable Crabtree?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.424
Hello, again, Miss Garrison.

14:21.727 --> 14:24.093
Do come in.
Sorry.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.489
Hey, there, fella.

14:26.565 --> 14:30.865
Oh, good boy, good boy.

14:30.936 --> 14:33.530
Okay, d-
No, down, down.

14:33.605 --> 14:35.505
- Good boy.
- He's a she, actually.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.166
Oh.

14:37.242 --> 14:38.573
Does she have a name?

14:38.644 --> 14:41.135
No.
No, not yet.

14:41.213 --> 14:44.444
So, what brings you here?

14:44.516 --> 14:47.246
Have you come to call on me?

14:47.319 --> 14:50.720
Actually, ma'am, I'm here
to escort you to the station

14:50.789 --> 14:51.949
for questioning.

15:06.171 --> 15:09.106
Sir, I have the security logs
as you asked.

15:09.174 --> 15:10.106
And?

15:10.175 --> 15:12.234
There was an alarm tripped
at 7 minutes past 1:00 a.m.,

15:12.311 --> 15:13.539
but nothing was damaged
or stolen.

15:13.612 --> 15:14.670
Or so it seemed.

15:14.746 --> 15:16.805
And Miss Garrison is waiting
for you in the interview room.

15:16.882 --> 15:17.814
Thank you.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.817
Sir, if you're busy,
I could conduct the interview.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.716
Thank you, George.
I'm sure I'll be fine.

15:21.787 --> 15:23.687
Of course.

15:24.756 --> 15:28.385
I care for animals.
Is that a crime?

15:28.460 --> 15:30.826
No, but sabotage is,

15:30.896 --> 15:33.694
especially when it ends
in the electrocution of a woman.

15:33.765 --> 15:35.357
Are you accusing me of murder?

15:35.434 --> 15:36.958
Did you tamper
with the equipment?

15:37.035 --> 15:39.196
No, of course not.
I would never do such a thing.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.966
No?
Not even to save the life

15:41.039 --> 15:43.872
of a poor, innocent dog,
Miss Garrison?

15:44.510 --> 15:46.068
As much as
I would have liked to,

15:46.145 --> 15:48.045
I wouldn't have even known how.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.445
Where were you
between midnight and 2:00 a.m?

15:50.516 --> 15:52.677
I was asleep in my bed,
of course.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.412
Can anyone vouch for this?

15:54.486 --> 15:56.852
Yes. I live
in Miss Beezley's Boarding House

15:56.955 --> 15:58.047
on Queen Street East.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.853
The doors are locked
at 10:00 sharp.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.326
Oh, sorry.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.501
So, Miss Garrison
is not involved, then?

16:12.571 --> 16:14.061
She could have spent
the night out.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.073
Have someone verify her story
with the landlady.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.438
But when I saw her at the stage,

16:17.509 --> 16:19.636
she seemed very bright-eyed
and perky.

16:19.711 --> 16:21.235
I mean, she didn't seem like
somebody who had spent the night

16:21.313 --> 16:22.280
breaking into buildings
and whatnot.

16:22.347 --> 16:24.645
George,
are you sweet on this girl?

16:24.716 --> 16:26.411
No.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.009
And I would never let
my personal feelings

16:28.086 --> 16:29.018
cloud my judgment.

16:29.087 --> 16:31.180
See that you don't,
because until proven otherwise,

16:31.256 --> 16:33.053
Miss Garrison remains a suspect.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.787
Murdoch, there's some tosser
in the booking area.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.455
Says he knows you.
And he's a bloody nuisance.

16:45.470 --> 16:46.402
Mr. Tesla.

16:46.471 --> 16:47.665
Detective Murdoch.

16:47.739 --> 16:48.967
So, you do know each other.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.770
Now, why doesn't that
surprise me?

16:50.842 --> 16:52.901
What the choffin' hell
are you doing to the telephone?

16:52.978 --> 16:55.037
I've been thinking
about Detective Murdoch's idea

16:55.113 --> 16:56.774
of transmitting voice
over airwaves.

16:56.882 --> 16:58.440
Voice over airwaves.

16:58.483 --> 17:00.451
Yes, and a thought
struck me while I waited here.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.646
I believe
with slight modifications,

17:02.721 --> 17:05.121
I could convey a telephone
signal using my transmitter.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.953
Would you care to assist me?

17:07.025 --> 17:08.458
I'd be honored.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.392
This is a telephone transmitter.

17:10.462 --> 17:12.089
You've been working on the idea,
as well.

17:12.164 --> 17:15.065
Yes, however, my motives are
much more selfish than yours.

17:15.133 --> 17:17.863
I've been trying to eavesdrop
on criminal conversation.

17:17.935 --> 17:18.903
The problem is the wires.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.563
How can you transmit
surreptitiously

17:20.638 --> 17:21.901
when you have wires
going everywhere?

17:21.973 --> 17:23.167
This is why you were asking me

17:23.242 --> 17:24.709
about wireless
voice transmission.

17:24.776 --> 17:26.003
Yes, in part.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.309
However, that can wait.
This is the switch box.

17:29.381 --> 17:32.145
Yes, it is the switch handle
we want to look at.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.481
The problem with using rubber
as an insulator

17:34.553 --> 17:36.680
is that, in time, it will crack.

17:36.755 --> 17:40.020
Yes, I've thought of that,
but this rubber is clearly new.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.992
If I wanted to kill somebody,

17:42.060 --> 17:45.086
I would cut through to the
metal, the underlying metal,

17:45.163 --> 17:46.528
and fill the slit
with a conductor.

17:46.598 --> 17:47.622
Such as?

17:47.699 --> 17:50.099
Graphite powder, one of
the best conductors there is.

17:50.168 --> 17:52.033
And it's black, like the rubber.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.332
The victim
never would have known

17:53.405 --> 17:55.566
that the handle
had been tampered with.

17:57.442 --> 17:59.603
The current would
cause the graphite to burn

17:59.678 --> 18:01.441
and the rubber to fuse...

18:01.513 --> 18:03.208
Erasing the evidence.

18:03.282 --> 18:04.715
But if that's the case,

18:04.783 --> 18:07.047
some graphite should remain
imbued in the rubber.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.212
Very good, Detective Murdoch.

18:09.288 --> 18:11.552
Shall we test your hypothesis?

18:12.324 --> 18:14.121
May I suggest your lamp?

18:16.962 --> 18:19.726
Rubber
is an effective insulator.

18:19.798 --> 18:22.631
A thin slice would stop
a strong current.

18:22.701 --> 18:25.135
But if this rubber is imbued
with the conductor,

18:25.203 --> 18:26.135
as we suspect,

18:26.204 --> 18:30.197
then it should allow the current
to go through.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.369
You may plug the lamp back in,
Mr. Tesla.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.642
It would seem the young lady
was murdered.

18:41.720 --> 18:44.450
The only question now is "Why?"

18:55.400 --> 18:57.459
New addition to your staff?

18:57.569 --> 19:00.868
Sometimes I desire
a little more companionship.

19:00.906 --> 19:02.874
Doctor, have you
a post-mortem report for me?

19:02.941 --> 19:04.568
Yes.
I'm sorry it took so long,

19:04.643 --> 19:07.669
but I rarely get the chance to
examine an electrocution victim.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.044
Yes, I suspect it will become
less rare in the next while.

19:10.115 --> 19:11.047
No doubt.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.448
Still, I was curious to know
the path the electricity took.

19:13.518 --> 19:14.815
And?

19:14.886 --> 19:16.649
Well, it entered her right hand,

19:16.722 --> 19:18.383
traveling
through her spinal cord,

19:18.457 --> 19:19.651
which I suppose makes sense.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.249
It passed through her liver,

19:21.326 --> 19:24.523
and then flowed down her
right leg, exiting via the heel.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.689
Electricity taking
the easiest path to ground.

19:26.765 --> 19:28.596
But how does it know
what that is?

19:28.667 --> 19:30.294
Nature at its most efficient.

19:30.369 --> 19:31.301
It's fascinating.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.770
Yes, however, I have determined
that Miss Howard was murdered.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.636
- Have you a motive?
- Not yet.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.538
Well,
I don't know if this helps,

19:37.609 --> 19:39.008
but I did find one thing.

19:39.077 --> 19:41.875
In following the electrical
path, I dissected the uterus.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.312
I found a small distension.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.781
So small I almost missed it.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.374
- A distension?
- Yes.

19:46.451 --> 19:49.113
Actually, an immature placenta.

19:49.187 --> 19:50.654
Miss Howard
was five weeks pregnant.

19:53.024 --> 19:55.857
Up the duff, was she?
Well, there's a motive for you.

19:55.927 --> 19:58.054
Whoever killed Miss Howard
knew about electricity,

19:58.130 --> 19:59.722
knew where the equipment
was stored,

19:59.798 --> 20:01.732
and knew the victim
would be pulling the switch.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.132
I believe the father is either
Daniel Pratt or Edwin Dodd.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.533
Jesus, Murdoch!

20:05.604 --> 20:06.696
Pratt's a bloody millionaire,

20:06.772 --> 20:08.535
and Dodd is the most powerful
man in city government

20:08.607 --> 20:09.539
next to the mayor.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.473
Either of 'em could eat you
for breakfast and probably will.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.103
What about old Guy Fawkes?
He fits the bill.

20:14.179 --> 20:15.908
Ah, Fawkes.
Very good, sir.

20:15.981 --> 20:17.380
I believe he has
far less motive.

20:17.449 --> 20:19.349
- Motive?
- You said it yourself.

20:19.418 --> 20:21.716
Pratt is a millionaire,
a married one.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.186
Dodd is a prominent
public figure.

20:23.255 --> 20:25.348
An illicit relationship
could cost them both dearly.

20:25.424 --> 20:28.393
And Fawkes had nowhere near
the stature of the other two.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.724
You do insist on playing
with fire, don't you?

20:30.796 --> 20:34.596
Hopefully, I will get to
the bottom of matters quickly.

20:34.666 --> 20:38.500
Alice and I shared a small flat
for the last two years.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.901
So, you knew her well, then?

20:39.971 --> 20:42.940
As well as anyone, I suppose.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.135
She worked days.
I worked nights.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.371
So we only saw each other
on Sundays.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.176
Even then, we were
very different people.

20:50.248 --> 20:52.182
How so?

20:53.018 --> 20:54.918
Well, I'm shy,

20:54.986 --> 20:57.716
especially when it comes to men.

20:57.823 --> 21:00.883
Alice wasn't at all.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.690
Men doted on her.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.957
Please.

21:06.031 --> 21:07.623
Thank you.

21:09.267 --> 21:10.859
I know this sounds terrible,

21:10.936 --> 21:13.564
but, well, I suspect
some of them were married.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.865
Was she seeing anyone special?

21:16.942 --> 21:18.967
There was one.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.534
It was all very secret.

21:20.612 --> 21:24.378
But, well, she seemed to be
in love with him.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.711
She told you this.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.514
A woman can always tell.

21:28.587 --> 21:31.488
I spoke to him several times
on the telephone.

21:31.556 --> 21:33.854
He had a nice voice.

21:40.365 --> 21:45.667
Um, do you recognize
either of these men?

21:47.072 --> 21:49.472
I'm sorry, no.

21:49.541 --> 21:52.738
I never met any of her beaus.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.178
Would you remember his name?

21:56.248 --> 21:58.148
Alice was very discreet.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.979
She never mentioned names.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.680
I have Miss Howard's
personal effects.

22:02.754 --> 22:05.689
However, we've been unable
to reach her next of kin.

22:05.757 --> 22:09.557
She has a sister in Kingston.

22:09.628 --> 22:11.823
I could see that she gets them.

22:11.897 --> 22:14.422
Do you know what this is?

22:14.499 --> 22:17.696
Her latest boyfriend
gave her that.

22:18.203 --> 22:20.034
Did he, now?

22:26.811 --> 22:28.244
Yes?

22:28.947 --> 22:30.778
Ah, Detective.

22:30.849 --> 22:32.339
Please have a seat.

22:32.417 --> 22:33.782
Would you like an orange?

22:33.852 --> 22:35.342
No, thank you.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.581
They're very hard to find,
grown in Florida.

22:37.656 --> 22:38.588
Thank you.

22:38.657 --> 22:40.557
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

22:40.625 --> 22:41.717
Certainly.
Go ahead.

22:41.793 --> 22:44.626
Well, um, what was the nature
of your relationship

22:44.696 --> 22:45.685
with Miss Howard?

22:45.764 --> 22:48.028
She was a member
of my clerical staff.

22:48.099 --> 22:49.225
Oh?

22:49.301 --> 22:51.166
I thought she was Miss Toronto
Electric and Light.

22:51.236 --> 22:53.534
She was far too beautiful
to remain a clerk.

22:53.605 --> 22:56.369
Is that why you were having
sexual relations with her?

22:56.441 --> 22:58.341
I beg your pardon.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.214
You gave this to her?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.147
I've never seen this before.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.720
I expect your wife
had her suspicions.

23:13.792 --> 23:14.986
Perhaps I'll ask her.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.084
Wait.

23:16.161 --> 23:18.356
All right.

23:18.430 --> 23:19.727
Yes.

23:19.798 --> 23:22.733
Alice and I
were briefly involved.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.428
But it's been over now
for weeks.

23:24.502 --> 23:26.766
When did she tell you
she was with child?

23:26.838 --> 23:28.772
- With child?
- Yes.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.432
Miss Howard
was five weeks pregnant.

23:30.508 --> 23:32.339
- But you knew that.
- My child?

23:32.410 --> 23:33.434
That's impossible.

23:33.511 --> 23:35.001
Yes, Mr. Pratt, your child.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.809
That's why you killed her,
isn't it?

23:36.881 --> 23:39.315
Killed her. No.
It was an accident.

23:39.384 --> 23:41.545
It wasn't an accident.

23:41.620 --> 23:42.917
Miss Howard was murdered.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.324
Thank you.

23:52.397 --> 23:53.489
Oh, sir.

23:53.565 --> 23:55.328
Is there anything else
you'll be needing this evening?

23:55.400 --> 23:57.527
I believe that's all.
Thank you, George.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.467
Okay.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

23:59.504 --> 24:01.096
George.

24:01.172 --> 24:03.436
Is that lavender I smell?

24:03.508 --> 24:07.035
Cleanliness, sir.
Next to godliness.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.169
I'll remember that.

24:31.302 --> 24:33.827
Does your detective wish
to interrogate me further?

24:33.905 --> 24:38.399
Actually, miss, my interests
here are strictly personal.

24:38.476 --> 24:42.572
I'm afraid my own interests
in that regard have waned.

24:45.316 --> 24:49.047
Miss, I'm well aware that
the ship between us has sailed.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.315
In fact, these flowers
were not meant for you.

24:51.389 --> 24:53.550
- They're not?
- No.

24:53.625 --> 24:54.887
This is very awkward now,

24:54.959 --> 24:57.792
but I was hoping to make
the acquaintance of your dog.

24:59.297 --> 25:01.231
Does she like violets?

25:01.299 --> 25:03.995
You've come to call on my dog?

25:04.069 --> 25:07.766
Yes. I was hoping
she would walk with me.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.501
In fact, I'd be very obliged
if you could join us,

25:10.575 --> 25:11.667
maybe as chaperone.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.814
Will you wait downstairs?

25:26.357 --> 25:28.757
Mr. Fawkes, what brings you by?

25:28.827 --> 25:31.523
Daniel Pratt came to see me
this afternoon.

25:31.596 --> 25:33.029
The man was beside himself.

25:33.098 --> 25:35.692
It's understandable.
His mistress is dead.

25:35.767 --> 25:37.325
And you suspect he killed her?

25:37.402 --> 25:38.494
I do.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.435
And I intend to prove it.

25:40.505 --> 25:42.370
I don't think you could be
more wrong, Detective.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.101
Oh.
Why is that?

25:44.175 --> 25:45.699
Because the original plan

25:45.777 --> 25:47.540
wasn't for Miss Howard
to throw the switch.

25:47.612 --> 25:50.479
So, who was supposed to throw
the switch, then?

25:50.548 --> 25:52.573
Alderman Dodd, of course.

25:52.650 --> 25:54.982
If anyone was the intended
victim, it was him.

25:58.690 --> 26:00.681
You look beautiful.

26:00.759 --> 26:04.354
And your owner's
not so bad either.

26:05.463 --> 26:07.055
She has to be back by 10:00.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.463
Does she have a name yet?

26:08.533 --> 26:10.160
Yes.
Violet.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.532
That's a pretty name.

26:11.603 --> 26:13.730
Pretty flowers.

26:13.805 --> 26:16.535
Well, Violet, shall we?

26:31.689 --> 26:34.852
Mr. Dodd?
Hello?

26:39.864 --> 26:42.196
Hello?

27:16.467 --> 27:18.958
Put your hands on your head.

27:19.037 --> 27:20.026
Slowly.

27:22.507 --> 27:24.532
Now, turning around.

27:24.609 --> 27:28.409
Again, very slowly.

27:32.617 --> 27:34.812
It's you.
You're...

27:34.886 --> 27:37.184
Detective William Murdoch.
Toronto Constabulary.

27:37.255 --> 27:38.552
Detective, what, in God's name,

27:38.623 --> 27:41.057
are you doing prowling around
in the middle of the night?

27:41.125 --> 27:42.956
Do you make a habit
of brandishing weaponry

27:43.027 --> 27:44.927
each time someone chances
to visit, Mr. Dodd?

27:44.996 --> 27:46.896
This?
This is my father's birding gun.

27:46.965 --> 27:49.263
I've never even touched it
before this evening.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.699
So, why bring it out now?

27:50.768 --> 27:53.396
You bloody well know why.
Someone tried to electrocute me.

27:53.471 --> 27:55.666
But, sir, why would someone
try to kill you?

27:55.740 --> 27:57.571
That's just it.
I've no idea.

27:57.675 --> 27:58.699
I'm a politician.

27:58.743 --> 28:00.005
A noble calling, to be sure,

28:00.078 --> 28:02.273
but you can't please everyone,
can you?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.611
But, Mr. Dodd,
you are also the chairman

28:04.682 --> 28:06.309
of the Street Lighting
Commission, are you not?

28:06.384 --> 28:08.181
I'm just one of five men
on that committee.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.585
Yes, but it's my understanding
you cast the deciding vote

28:10.655 --> 28:12.088
if there were to be a tie.

28:12.156 --> 28:14.386
In effect, you decide whether
or not alternating current

28:14.459 --> 28:16.689
comes to Toronto,
making you a very powerful man.

28:16.761 --> 28:19.229
My position is known by all,
and I've never wavered.

28:19.297 --> 28:21.561
I have no idea why someone
may want to harm me.

28:27.772 --> 28:28.932
Oh, I don't know, Murdoch.

28:29.007 --> 28:30.201
Something's not quite right
about this.

28:30.275 --> 28:31.207
I agree.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.506
But who would have stood to
profit from Dodd's death?

28:33.578 --> 28:35.205
The A. C. camp, I suppose.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.770
But, then,
why do it in such a way

28:36.848 --> 28:38.213
to discredit their own system?

28:38.283 --> 28:39.307
Yes, and, furthermore,

28:39.384 --> 28:41.545
cities everywhere are adopting
the A. C. system.

28:41.619 --> 28:42.745
Toronto may not this time,

28:42.820 --> 28:45.721
but they will have to soon
or face being left behind.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.314
Then, maybe it was someone
from the D. C. side.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.485
That wouldn't make sense either.
Dodd supported D. C.

28:49.560 --> 28:50.618
Or so he says.

28:50.695 --> 28:52.993
But in my experience, dealing
with people like Edwin Dodd,

28:53.064 --> 28:53.996
what they say and what they do

28:54.065 --> 28:55.191
are two totally
different things.

28:55.266 --> 28:57.564
Well, if anything, the A. C. camp
would want to sway his vote.

28:57.669 --> 28:59.432
Bribery?

28:59.470 --> 29:00.960
Which may explain -

29:01.039 --> 29:02.939
Do you have today's paper?

29:08.813 --> 29:11.338
Niagara A. C.

29:12.817 --> 29:13.749
What is it?

29:13.818 --> 29:17.015
The stock rose
from 76 to 95 cents.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.248
After Miss Howard's death,

29:18.323 --> 29:19.756
I would have thought
the stock would have dropped.

29:19.824 --> 29:22.657
Yeah, but, instead,
it rose by almost 25 %.

29:22.727 --> 29:24.820
Probably the A. C. people
buying it.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.955
Which seems to indicate
that the fix was in.

29:27.031 --> 29:28.589
So it would seem.

29:28.666 --> 29:31.692
But how did you know
about the stock, sir?

29:31.769 --> 29:32.963
Intuition.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.334
Really?

29:34.405 --> 29:37.135
Well, I can't bloody well retire
on a copper's salary, can I?

29:37.208 --> 29:38.903
So I've been following
the markets.

29:38.977 --> 29:40.842
Something that you'd be
well-advised to look into,

29:40.912 --> 29:42.072
me old mucker.

29:42.146 --> 29:46.344
Perhaps I will, after I look
into this bribery situation.

29:46.417 --> 29:47.645
Hurry!

29:47.719 --> 29:50.153
I can't.
I have a stitch.

29:54.158 --> 29:56.353
Oh, no.

29:56.427 --> 29:57.951
- It's locked?
- What time is it?

29:59.864 --> 30:01.491
Two minutes past the hour.

30:01.566 --> 30:04.296
Two minutes.
Damn that woman's dark soul.

30:04.369 --> 30:05.336
Should you knock?

30:05.403 --> 30:07.132
No. I've got two demerits
this month.

30:07.205 --> 30:08.729
One more and I'm out.
Come on.

30:11.442 --> 30:13.273
Hello?

30:14.712 --> 30:16.942
Mr. Tesla?

30:17.015 --> 30:19.074
Hello?

30:21.619 --> 30:23.883
Mr. Tesla?

30:25.490 --> 30:26.980
Hello.

30:27.058 --> 30:28.184
Hello?

30:28.259 --> 30:30.056
I said hello.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.460
Hello, Mr. Tesla.

30:32.530 --> 30:33.792
You must hold down the switch

30:33.865 --> 30:34.854
on the side of the box to speak.

30:34.932 --> 30:37.162
Then release it to listen.

30:37.635 --> 30:40.502
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Tesla?

30:40.905 --> 30:43.703
That's it.
Hello, Detective Murdoch.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.834
Mr. Tesla, where are you?

30:45.910 --> 30:48.708
I am dining at the Grand Hotel.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.975
How did you know I was here?

30:51.049 --> 30:54.985
You tripped a switch
when you came through the door.

30:56.654 --> 30:58.588
Mr. Tesla,
I have some questions.

30:58.689 --> 30:59.849
Of course you do.

30:59.891 --> 31:01.085
There is much to know.

31:01.159 --> 31:02.717
Essentially, what I have done

31:02.794 --> 31:05.024
is taken a conventional
telephone signal

31:05.096 --> 31:07.064
and passed it through
a coil and condenser set -

31:07.131 --> 31:08.723
No, Mr. Tesla.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.461
I have questions
about the murder.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.230
I need to speak with you
in person.

31:12.303 --> 31:16.069
Yes, very well.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.273
I always leave the latch open.

31:34.158 --> 31:36.592
Pass me Violet.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.794
Good girl.

31:48.606 --> 31:49.868
Are you coming?

31:51.275 --> 31:52.503
You want me to come in?

31:52.577 --> 31:53.509
Just for tea.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.308
I mean, you can leave
by the back stairs.

31:56.380 --> 31:57.870
All right.

32:03.121 --> 32:04.588
All right.

32:04.655 --> 32:06.555
Oh, my!

32:06.624 --> 32:08.717
Oh, dear.

32:12.163 --> 32:14.563
You are accusing me
of bribing a civic official.

32:14.632 --> 32:17.533
Not you, Mr. Tesla.
Perhaps someone in your camp.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.832
I am a scientist,
Detective Murdoch.

32:19.904 --> 32:22.873
I do not sully my hands with
the sordid details of business.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.465
But if I may speak frankly...

32:25.543 --> 32:26.510
Of course.

32:26.577 --> 32:28.374
Alternating current
doesn't need to bribe its way

32:28.446 --> 32:29.378
into the future.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.881
The forces of logic and history
compel it to.

32:31.949 --> 32:33.883
Many inventions have been
ahead of their time, Mr. Tesla.

32:33.951 --> 32:35.851
Consider the works
of Da Vinci alone.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.012
Even your hometown of New York

32:37.088 --> 32:38.612
has been slow to adapt
to your system.

32:38.689 --> 32:39.781
I reiterate.

32:39.857 --> 32:41.950
I -

32:42.026 --> 32:45.189
We did not bribe Mr. Dodd.

32:45.263 --> 32:46.195
Then, Mr. Tesla,

32:46.264 --> 32:48.323
how do you explain
the fluctuating stock prices?

32:48.399 --> 32:51.095
It should have gone down
after what happened.

32:56.174 --> 32:59.007
I shall get
to the bottom of this.

33:00.411 --> 33:01.503
Dodd's banking information.

33:01.579 --> 33:03.171
Cost me a bottle
of my finest Scotch.

33:03.247 --> 33:05.477
- Hope it was worth it.
- See for yourself.

33:05.550 --> 33:10.283
$20, 000 deposited last Monday.

33:10.354 --> 33:11.821
How much does an alderman make?

33:11.889 --> 33:13.857
$300 a year, if he's lucky.

33:13.925 --> 33:16.325
So, if Niagara A. C.
had bought off Dodd...

33:16.394 --> 33:17.986
They had no reason to kill him.

33:18.062 --> 33:20.087
So I suppose somebody from
the D. C. camp must have done it.

33:20.164 --> 33:21.893
What if Pratt had found out?

33:21.966 --> 33:23.490
And he still
was under the assumption

33:23.568 --> 33:25.035
that Dodd was his man.

33:25.102 --> 33:27.764
Well, if it was me,
I'd want to kill the bastard.

33:30.708 --> 33:34.303
Honest to goodness, how can
a police officer be so clumsy?

33:34.378 --> 33:36.175
Well, breaking and entering
with grace

33:36.247 --> 33:37.908
is not exactly part of my job.

33:37.982 --> 33:40.007
Well, don't worry
about the mess.

33:40.084 --> 33:41.551
I'll make us a pot of tea.

33:41.619 --> 33:44.349
Um, I have a confession to make.

33:45.957 --> 33:48.983
It wasn't your dog
I was sweet on.

33:50.828 --> 33:53.194
I mean, she's really great,
but...

33:56.400 --> 33:58.231
Did that hurt?

33:58.336 --> 34:01.567
It hurt really nice.

34:18.589 --> 34:21.387
- I should go make some tea.
- Yeah.

34:54.292 --> 34:57.557
He's supposed to be working,
and it's almost midnight.

34:57.628 --> 34:59.357
His wife said
he likes to keep late hours.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.295
Huh.
I bet that Miss Howard did, too.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.966
What's wrong with the lights?

35:06.170 --> 35:07.296
Daniel Pratt?

35:09.106 --> 35:10.095
Mr. Pratt?

35:10.174 --> 35:12.734
Mr. Pratt?

35:12.810 --> 35:13.936
Wait, sir, don't!

35:14.011 --> 35:15.740
- What?
- Don't touch him.

35:15.813 --> 35:17.781
I believe
he's been electrocuted.

35:17.848 --> 35:19.145
Had you touched him
or the telephone,

35:19.216 --> 35:20.376
you might also be dead.

35:30.761 --> 35:33.753
As you suspected,
another electrocution.

35:33.831 --> 35:34.889
Yes, except, this time,

35:34.965 --> 35:37.195
the current flowed directly
through the heart.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.259
Yes, it stopped dead.
How did you know that?

35:39.337 --> 35:41.328
The killer was quite ingenious,
really.

35:41.405 --> 35:42.895
As soon as the earpiece
was lifted,

35:42.973 --> 35:44.907
the electrical current flowed
through the arm,

35:44.975 --> 35:47.170
across the chest,
and out the other arm.

35:47.244 --> 35:48.302
It's not my place,

35:48.379 --> 35:51.177
but would Mr. Dodd have
the knowledge to do this?

35:51.248 --> 35:52.510
It's quite simple, actually.

35:52.583 --> 35:55.518
The earpiece was wired
directly to the power outlet.

35:55.586 --> 35:58.180
The next call that came for
Mr. Pratt proved to be deadly.

35:58.289 --> 36:00.086
- Uh, sir?
- Yes, George?

36:00.124 --> 36:01.785
There's something
I need to speak with you about.

36:01.859 --> 36:03.349
- It will have to wait.
- Oi, bugalug, shift.

36:03.427 --> 36:05.691
- Sir, we need to arrest Dodd.
- Not without evidence.

36:05.763 --> 36:06.695
We have evidence.

36:06.764 --> 36:09.028
We might have got him
on corruption, but not murder.

36:09.100 --> 36:10.158
Do you not think he did it?

36:10.234 --> 36:11.997
One electrocution for another.

36:12.069 --> 36:13.730
An eye for an eye.
It's bloody poetic.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.965
Who else could have done it?

36:16.040 --> 36:19.168
Actually, sir, there is someone.

36:29.220 --> 36:30.312
Where did you get that?

36:30.388 --> 36:32.253
How did a schematic
for an A. C. generator

36:32.323 --> 36:33.984
end up in your possession,
Miss Garrison?

36:34.058 --> 36:35.958
You had your constable spy
on me?

36:36.026 --> 36:37.459
Must I repeat the question?

36:37.528 --> 36:40.691
I needed it,
to sabotage the demonstration.

36:40.765 --> 36:42.756
So you broke
into Mr. Pratt's warehouse

36:42.833 --> 36:44.266
and tampered with the handle.

36:44.335 --> 36:47.827
Uh, no, I was at the warehouse,
but we didn't do anything.

36:47.905 --> 36:49.099
We?

36:49.173 --> 36:50.606
There were three of us.

36:50.674 --> 36:53.199
We had to make sure
that those bastards

36:53.277 --> 36:54.938
didn't kill
any more innocent animals,

36:55.012 --> 36:56.377
at least not for that day.

36:56.447 --> 36:58.210
What happened, then?

36:58.315 --> 37:01.250
Well, when the alarm went off,

37:01.285 --> 37:03.776
we just panicked and ran.

37:03.854 --> 37:05.116
Nothing more?

37:05.189 --> 37:07.180
Nothing more.

37:30.481 --> 37:33.109
Sir, you believe
Miss Garrison, then?

37:33.184 --> 37:35.550
It would explain
why the alarm went off

37:35.619 --> 37:37.280
but the security guard found
no one.

37:37.354 --> 37:38.412
Well, that's a relief.

37:38.489 --> 37:40.047
So, you let the girlfriend off,
eh?

37:40.124 --> 37:42.092
Inspector, my relationship
with Miss Garrison

37:42.159 --> 37:43.751
is strictly professional.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.921
Hey, Romeo,
it's me you're talking to.

37:45.996 --> 37:47.156
Of course it is.

37:47.231 --> 37:49.131
So, we're back to Dodd, are we?

37:49.200 --> 37:50.292
It has to be him.

37:50.367 --> 37:51.629
Dodd's a D. C. man.

37:51.702 --> 37:54.136
He starts taking
bribes from the other side.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.900
Pratt finds out,
stands to lose a fortune,

37:55.973 --> 37:57.406
decides to eliminate Dodd.

37:57.508 --> 37:59.305
Sees his chance
at the demonstration.

37:59.343 --> 38:00.275
Slips into the warehouse -

38:00.344 --> 38:01.971
his own warehouse,
no one asks a question

38:02.046 --> 38:04.139
does some friggin' and jiggin'
with the generator.

38:04.215 --> 38:06.877
But at the last minute, Miss
Howard steps into Dodd's place.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.441
And all Pratt can do is look on

38:08.519 --> 38:10.419
as his mistress flicks
the switch.

38:16.093 --> 38:17.355
Yes.

38:17.428 --> 38:18.895
Dodd finds out
that Pratt's onto him,

38:18.963 --> 38:21.158
decides to seek his own revenge.

38:21.232 --> 38:22.893
Plausible.
Bloody plausible.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.662
How do we prove it?

38:24.735 --> 38:26.532
I have an idea.

38:28.973 --> 38:30.998
The transmittable distance
will depend on power.

38:31.075 --> 38:33.236
You're saying
it must be transportable?

38:33.310 --> 38:35.778
Yes, something roughly
the size of a suitcase.

38:35.846 --> 38:36.938
It will be heavy.

38:37.014 --> 38:38.811
35 pounds at least.

38:38.883 --> 38:40.441
He doesn't have to carry it far.

38:40.518 --> 38:41.450
Still a challenge.

38:41.519 --> 38:43.646
It's my understanding
that you enjoy a challenge.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.212
That, I do.

38:46.290 --> 38:48.758
You want me to blackmail
Edwin Dodd?

38:48.826 --> 38:51.954
Yes, but only as a means
of making him admit his guilt.

38:52.029 --> 38:53.758
I don't know.
He's already killed one man.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.230
What's to stop him
from killing me?

38:55.299 --> 38:56.288
You'll be in a public place,

38:56.367 --> 38:57.834
and we will record
your conversation.

38:57.935 --> 38:58.902
How?
That's impossible.

38:58.936 --> 39:00.267
No longer, Mr. Fawkes.

39:00.337 --> 39:02.532
- Mr. Fawkes.
- Mr. Tesla.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.369
I understand congratulations
are in order.

39:04.441 --> 39:05.931
The engagement
isn't official yet.

39:06.010 --> 39:06.942
Still, an heiress.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.444
I suppose
if you can't earn a fortune,

39:08.512 --> 39:09.911
it helps to marry into it.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.005
- I will not work with this man.
- Likewise.

39:12.082 --> 39:13.640
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

39:13.717 --> 39:15.844
I will ask that you put aside
your personal differences.

39:15.920 --> 39:19.253
I left the receiver in my lab
with my assistant

39:19.323 --> 39:21.052
to test the range of the device.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.685
Mr. Fawkes,
if you will say something

39:23.761 --> 39:24.989
in the direction
of the briefcase...

39:25.062 --> 39:25.994
What should I say?

39:26.063 --> 39:28.554
Whatever comes to mind.
It need not be pithy.

39:29.633 --> 39:32.431
Little Miss Muffet sat
on a tuffet,

39:32.503 --> 39:35.028
eating her curds and whey.

39:35.105 --> 39:39.235
Well, your device seems
a bit underwhelming.

39:39.310 --> 39:42.074
Just a moment.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.245
Yes.

39:49.353 --> 39:51.412
Little Miss Muffet sat
on a tuffet,

39:51.488 --> 39:52.580
eating her curds and whey.

39:52.656 --> 39:55.022
You've outdone yourself, Nikola.

39:55.092 --> 39:58.960
Actually, I must share the
credit with Detective Murdoch.

40:04.234 --> 40:06.293
- Mr. Fawkes.
- Have a seat.

40:06.370 --> 40:09.396
- What's this?
- My new suitcase.

40:09.473 --> 40:11.065
Very stylish.

40:11.141 --> 40:13.632
Not very, but it is
surprisingly practical.

40:13.711 --> 40:15.941
Now, I don't have much time.
What is this all about?

40:16.013 --> 40:17.503
I know what you did last night.

40:19.350 --> 40:20.578
What are you talking about?

40:20.651 --> 40:22.551
I know everything, Edwin.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.418
You took 20, 000
from Niagara A. C.

40:27.024 --> 40:28.013
Pratt was onto you.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.650
Is that why you killed him?

40:29.727 --> 40:31.251
I don't need to sit here
and listen to this.

40:31.328 --> 40:33.319
It's up to you,
but if you walk away,

40:33.397 --> 40:34.694
I will go to the police.

40:38.235 --> 40:39.395
How much?

40:40.804 --> 40:41.736
Half.

40:41.805 --> 40:43.102
$ 10,000.

40:43.173 --> 40:45.869
I don't have $ 10,000.

40:45.943 --> 40:47.638
Well, that's too bad.

40:47.711 --> 40:49.178
The amount's non-negotiable.

40:49.246 --> 40:51.874
All right.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.644
But I'll need some time.

40:53.717 --> 40:56.515
I spent it all
on Niagara A. C. stock.

40:59.323 --> 41:01.917
Shall I play the rest
of the conversation, Mr. Dodd?

41:01.992 --> 41:05.621
What do you want?

41:05.696 --> 41:07.630
A full confession.

41:13.537 --> 41:15.630
So, is it case closed?

41:15.706 --> 41:17.970
That's a good expression,
case closed.

41:18.042 --> 41:20.101
It's strong.
I should remember it.

41:20.177 --> 41:21.940
Dodd confessed to killing Pratt

41:22.012 --> 41:24.310
and to taking bribes
from Niagara A. C.

41:24.381 --> 41:25.973
You sound disappointed.

41:26.050 --> 41:28.450
I only wish I'd gotten
a confession from Pratt himself

41:28.519 --> 41:30.419
that he, in fact,
rigged the switch.

41:30.487 --> 41:32.318
Well, be grateful that you're
not still trying to prove

41:32.389 --> 41:33.356
he wanted to kill Miss Howard.

41:33.424 --> 41:34.356
Why is that?

41:34.425 --> 41:35.653
Because I don't think
he had motive.

41:35.726 --> 41:37.751
What makes you say that?

41:37.828 --> 41:39.591
Mr. Pratt's pubic bone
was severely broken.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.722
It's a green break, probably
happened in childhood.

41:41.799 --> 41:44.233
Both seminal vessels
were crushed.

41:44.301 --> 41:46.394
So, then...

41:46.470 --> 41:48.461
He couldn't have impregnated
Miss Howard.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.370
- But if he didn't...
- Who did?

41:50.441 --> 41:52.807
Probably someone
who shouldn't have.

41:52.876 --> 41:55.709
Perhaps Dodd wasn't the target
after all.

41:55.779 --> 41:58.077
Perhaps it was Miss Howard.

41:58.182 --> 42:00.844
Her latest boyfriend
gave her that.

42:00.884 --> 42:02.374
I've never seen this before.

42:02.453 --> 42:04.045
Pratt was telling the truth.

42:04.121 --> 42:05.645
What are you talking about,
William?

42:05.723 --> 42:08.385
Pratt never gave Miss Howard
the pendant.

42:08.459 --> 42:11.826
But she was in love with someone
in the electric business.

42:16.800 --> 42:17.528
Miss Howard.

42:22.372 --> 42:25.205
It was Fawkes.
He had access to the warehouse.

42:25.275 --> 42:27.140
He knew Miss Howard
would be throwing the switch.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.872
And why would he
want to kill Miss Howard?

42:28.946 --> 42:30.777
He was about to marry
into a very wealthy family.

42:30.848 --> 42:32.338
Her pregnancy
would have ruined everything.

42:32.416 --> 42:34.646
That's monstrous.

42:34.718 --> 42:36.276
How will you prove it?

42:36.353 --> 42:38.878
Luckily, I have a witness.

42:38.956 --> 42:40.890
I know everything, Edwin.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.755
You took 20, 000
from Niagara A. C.

42:42.826 --> 42:43.758
That's him.

42:43.827 --> 42:47.194
That the voice I heard on the
telephone calling for Alice.

42:47.264 --> 42:49.494
I'd recognize it anywhere.

42:52.336 --> 42:54.201
You visited Toronto
five weeks ago

42:54.271 --> 42:55.932
in preparation
for your demonstration.

42:56.006 --> 42:57.735
Miss Howard
was five weeks pregnant.

42:57.841 --> 42:59.433
Shall I go on?

42:59.476 --> 43:02.240
I think I'd like to speak
with a barrister.

43:19.630 --> 43:21.393
Hello, miss.

43:22.132 --> 43:24.566
I didn't expect
I'd see you again.

43:24.635 --> 43:27.934
Well, Violet violated
Miss Beezley's slippers.

43:28.005 --> 43:29.199
Oh, is that right?

43:29.273 --> 43:30.968
I'm sorry to hear that.

43:31.041 --> 43:33.771
I've no one to take her.
Would you?

43:33.844 --> 43:37.837
Yes, of course, of course.

43:38.849 --> 43:42.512
Um, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about what happened.

43:42.586 --> 43:45.419
So am I.

43:46.857 --> 43:48.984
Perhaps I could pay her a visit,

43:49.059 --> 43:51.823
to ensure
she's being treated well.

43:53.964 --> 43:56.694
I think that would be the
responsible thing to do, ma'am.

44:03.073 --> 44:06.839
Come on. Come on, girl.

44:06.910 --> 44:10.107
Hello?

44:10.180 --> 44:12.205
Mr. Tesla?

44:15.552 --> 44:17.543
Mr. Tesla?

44:18.956 --> 44:21.481
Hello?

44:27.364 --> 44:28.991
Detective Murdoch.

44:29.066 --> 44:31.864
You are the first to receive
a wireless transmission

44:31.935 --> 44:33.800
from New York.

44:33.871 --> 44:35.270
I came to thank you and...

44:35.339 --> 44:37.330
Do not attempt
to transmit in return.

44:37.407 --> 44:40.069
The power of this unit
is far too weak.

44:40.143 --> 44:43.203
While I do think this is
a splendid invention,

44:43.280 --> 44:45.339
I have other ideas
of much greater importance

44:45.415 --> 44:46.905
that must be explored.

44:46.984 --> 44:50.317
We are men of the future,
Detective Murdoch.

44:50.387 --> 44:53.720
And what a future it shall be.

44:53.790 --> 44:55.519
Yes.

44:56.593 --> 44:59.255
What a future it shall be.
