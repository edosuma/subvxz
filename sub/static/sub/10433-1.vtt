01:07.400 --> 01:08.900
Doctor!

01:09.602 --> 01:11.270
I need you in here!

01:20.213 --> 01:22.681
Doctor, I need you to see this.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.750
God dammit. What? What is it?

01:24.752 --> 01:28.120
There's been an incident.
I need your help.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.522
Get Mr. Warren.
He'll take care of it.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.057
But doctor...

01:32.059 --> 01:35.327
I'm in the middle
of a surgery, nurse.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.296
I'll get there as soon as I can.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.363
Yes, doctor.

01:43.236 --> 01:44.469
Where was I?

01:52.211 --> 01:54.613
That's him.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.415
<i>Come on.</i>

01:57.650 --> 01:58.817
<i>Come on!</i>

02:22.275 --> 02:24.743
Stop making things difficult.

02:30.616 --> 02:32.217
Let me go!

02:32.219 --> 02:33.117
Get me out of here!

02:33.119 --> 02:35.554
Let me go. Let me out of here.

02:36.622 --> 02:40.092
Scream all you want.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.861
No one can hear you.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.800
Kids.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.703
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

03:08.721 --> 03:10.589
<i>Zula.</i>

03:44.090 --> 03:45.524
Are we there yet?

03:48.761 --> 03:50.629
Yeah, Megan, we're here.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.803
Smart ass.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.515
Where is everyone?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.784
Shouldn't they be here by now?

05:52.786 --> 05:54.586
As far as I know.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.520
<i>Megan?</i>

05:55.522 --> 05:57.522
Oh, look, there's Dale.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.664
<i>Hey, Dale.</i>

06:18.044 --> 06:20.211
Welcome to Tearlon.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.479
Not bad.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.448
Yeah, they're still in the
process of remodeling,

06:23.450 --> 06:25.450
but the whole
interior's brand new.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.198
- Hey, Megan.
- Hey.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.666
You get a look around?

06:41.668 --> 06:44.436
Uh, no, still trying
to get to my room.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.772
It gets more beautiful
every time I come up here.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.441
If you'll excuse me, Rita,

06:49.443 --> 06:51.776
we should probably show
these two to their room.

06:57.316 --> 06:58.817
Our room?

06:58.819 --> 07:00.452
Yeah. Come on.

07:02.521 --> 07:03.388
Okay.

07:08.394 --> 07:09.694
Come on in.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.102
So everyone else called dibs.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.336
You two are the last ones here.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.638
So you're going
to have to share.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.539
Hope there aren't
any objections.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.341
Cute double beds.

07:23.343 --> 07:24.709
Yeah. Great.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.345
So?

07:27.347 --> 07:29.247
I'm okay with it if you are.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.548
It works for me.

07:32.451 --> 07:36.655
Well, you two are
the only ones not to complain.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.490
It seems our little group
has a talent

07:38.492 --> 07:40.659
for finding flaws
in a free trip.

07:40.661 --> 07:41.559
Don't worry, Dale.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.628
I'm sure we'll
think of something.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.829
All right.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.831
I'll be downstairs
if you need anything.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.366
- Thanks, Dale.
- Sure.

07:51.337 --> 07:53.104
<i>Wow.</i>

07:53.106 --> 07:54.673
Look at that view.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.751
Oh, shit.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.471
- Hey!
- - Jesus, Tedi.

08:59.473 --> 09:00.905
Jesus? Where?

09:01.340 --> 09:03.608
- Did you see him?
- - See who?

09:03.610 --> 09:05.443
- The kid.
- - What kid?

09:05.445 --> 09:06.878
The little kid.

09:07.446 --> 09:08.880
What? I didn't see any kid.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.116
I saw Joel.

09:11.417 --> 09:12.784
Who the fuck is Joel?

09:12.786 --> 09:14.786
Joel is lira's special
delivery from her

09:14.788 --> 09:16.221
douche of the month club.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.522
Wait, what?

09:17.524 --> 09:19.457
Lira brought some guy.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.825
She brought her boyfriend?

09:20.827 --> 09:23.261
Yeah, if you want
to call him that.

09:23.263 --> 09:26.064
But I thought this trip
was just for our department.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.800
Yeah, I thought so too, but I
guess she found a loophole.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.668
Which was?

09:30.670 --> 09:32.570
She just showed up with him.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.139
And if I'd known
you could do that,

09:34.141 --> 09:36.508
I would have brought myself a
little something to poke on.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.177
Tedi.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.445
Come on. It could happen.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.447
Fyi, you've got to share
a wall with them,

09:42.449 --> 09:43.815
so I hope you weren't planning

09:43.817 --> 09:45.283
on getting any sleep
this weekend.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.518
Are you kidding me?

09:46.520 --> 09:47.418
No.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.320
Oh, what's this is
I hear about you

09:49.322 --> 09:51.256
and, uh, forest sharing a room?

09:51.258 --> 09:52.457
It's no big deal.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.659
It's not like we're in
the same bed or anything.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.661
Yeah, not with that
attitude you're not.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.463
We're just friends.

09:58.465 --> 10:01.666
Oh, so then it's cool if
we switch rooms, right?

10:01.668 --> 10:03.902
You touch her and I'll kill you.

10:05.471 --> 10:06.471
Don't move.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.740
She can't see us
if we don't move.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.111
Hey, Zac.

10:14.413 --> 10:15.547
What's up, fellas?

10:18.250 --> 10:19.884
What was that all about?

10:20.820 --> 10:22.253
Shut up, Tedi.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.526
Zac, I'll see you at dinner.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.060
Who was that?

11:02.062 --> 11:03.461
No one.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.729
I can't get a signal.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.465
You know the first
rule of vacationing.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.367
Leave everything behind.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.768
I know.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.538
But this isn't a vacation, Zac.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.173
It's a retreat.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.541
All right, smart ass.

11:17.443 --> 11:21.446
Attention please..

11:21.448 --> 11:22.280
See?

11:22.282 --> 11:23.681
Back to work.

11:26.452 --> 11:27.652
Could I get everyone's attention

11:27.654 --> 11:29.354
down in the living room, please?

11:34.426 --> 11:35.894
You guys seen Tedi?

11:37.264 --> 11:38.463
He's in the bathroom.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.164
Probably beating off.

11:40.499 --> 11:41.299
Nope.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.368
I tugged one out before we left.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.435
I am good.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.670
All right.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.472
Looks like everyone's here.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.706
I just wanted to
let you guys know

11:48.708 --> 11:50.408
you need to be
extra careful, okay?

11:50.410 --> 11:52.410
Especially if you wander
out in the woods at night.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.645
The caretaker said
there's a lot of bears

11:53.647 --> 11:54.812
around this time of year.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.614
Wouldn't look really good
on my review if one of you

11:56.616 --> 11:59.250
come back dead or with a
huge bite out of your ass.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.685
Don't even think about it.

12:00.687 --> 12:01.653
All right?

12:01.655 --> 12:03.454
Tonight's fair game, guys. Okay.

12:03.456 --> 12:06.424
Have fun, whatever, but let's
not forget why we're up here.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.126
We have our first
meeting tomorrow.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.161
Yeah, why are we here?

12:10.629 --> 12:11.828
Ah, good question.

12:11.830 --> 12:15.266
Uh, we're up here because it's
a simultaneous pat on the back

12:15.268 --> 12:17.502
and kick in the
pants, to be honest.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.504
The head honchos love
what we're doing, okay?

12:19.506 --> 12:20.705
That's why we're here.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.440
But they're worried that
our shareholders

12:22.442 --> 12:24.242
are going to get a little
bit antsy and jump ship

12:24.244 --> 12:26.411
if our little growth
stock doesn't somehow

12:26.413 --> 12:28.179
exceed next quarter's forecast.

12:28.614 --> 12:29.514
Rita?

12:30.616 --> 12:33.051
We'd like to start by
getting everyone together

12:33.053 --> 12:35.153
to help inspire team unity.

12:38.223 --> 12:39.490
Oh, and they want
to pick our brains

12:39.492 --> 12:42.226
to see if we can figure out
ways to increase productivity.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.662
Of course, with the same
amount of resources,

12:44.664 --> 12:45.763
which is always nice.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.099
It's only a couple
of meetings, people, okay?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.467
You pretty much have
the rest of the weekend

12:49.469 --> 12:50.468
to do whatever you want.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.270
Like get eaten by bears?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.271
Rawr.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.640
Fine, if it makes you happy.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.140
Okay?

12:56.142 --> 12:58.643
If there aren't any
other smart Aleck remarks,

12:58.645 --> 13:00.712
does anyone have any
questions or comments?

13:00.714 --> 13:01.546
Yeah.

13:02.047 --> 13:03.748
What if we see a ghost?

13:05.451 --> 13:07.385
Meigan, ghosts aren't real.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.319
Thank you.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.754
Uh, what about the holy ghost?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.557
That's not the same thing.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.760
But you believe in Jesus, right?

13:16.662 --> 13:17.762
Of course.

13:17.764 --> 13:21.099
Well, isn't that kind of
like believing in Santa Claus,

13:21.101 --> 13:22.767
but not the Easter bunny?

13:24.436 --> 13:27.338
Tedi, you don't
believe in Christ?

13:27.840 --> 13:32.310
Um, no, but I do believe
in the antichrist.

13:35.414 --> 13:36.581
How come?

13:37.649 --> 13:39.484
Because she works in marketing.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.452
Okay.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.653
Knock it off. Knock it off.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.255
Let's not start a holy war.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.757
See what you started?

13:46.258 --> 13:48.259
At some point during the
weekend I expect

13:48.261 --> 13:50.661
each of to thank Rita,
for talking to Penny Pinchers

13:50.663 --> 13:52.830
into even letting
us come up here.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.499
Thank you so much, Rita.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.767
Thank you, Rita.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.468
Yeah, thanks, Rita.

13:57.470 --> 13:58.536
You're the best.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.540
Meigan, if I could
offer a piece of advice?

14:03.442 --> 14:04.308
Shoot.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.676
Don't worry about dead.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.513
Fear the living,
especially with this group.

14:08.814 --> 14:10.448
All righty.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.749
I'll bear that in mind.

14:14.253 --> 14:16.354
Hey, Dale, can I
talk to you for a sec?

14:17.823 --> 14:19.157
Sure, Zach. What's up?

14:20.426 --> 14:22.260
Who was that old man with Rita?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.728
That was Earl ray,
the caretaker.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.496
He greeted us when we got here.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.265
Is he staying here?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.534
No, he said he has a
cabin nearby somewhere.

14:30.469 --> 14:31.469
Really?

14:31.471 --> 14:32.470
Yeah.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.338
Only living soul
around for miles.

14:36.608 --> 14:38.242
Okay, thanks.

14:38.244 --> 14:39.043
No problem.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.478
Good meeting.

14:47.453 --> 14:48.786
Ugh.

14:49.254 --> 14:50.721
Nature sucks.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.090
Oh, come on.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.558
I kind of like it here.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.728
I'm probably going to get,
like, a million mosquito bites.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.330
Can you blame them?

15:03.669 --> 15:06.537
What the hell are we going to do
up here for three days?

15:07.072 --> 15:10.741
Well, there's a hot
tub on the porch.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.445
Um, you trying to
get me into a bikini?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.313
No,

15:16.648 --> 15:18.549
trying to get you out of one.

15:19.651 --> 15:23.121
The blue one or the black?

15:26.492 --> 15:28.259
Hmm, I don't know.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.760
I'm going to have
to see them on.

15:31.663 --> 15:32.530
Alright.

16:17.442 --> 16:18.509
Well?

16:21.547 --> 16:22.747
I don't know. Turn around.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.251
It's kind of revealing,
don't you think?

16:27.253 --> 16:28.753
That's the point.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.721
Don't worry I have a wrap

16:31.256 --> 16:33.558
to keep Tedi from
checking out my ass.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.494
Let me see the other one.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.095
Are you serious?

16:38.097 --> 16:39.730
Yeah, I'm dead serious.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.733
Fine.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.373
Happy?

17:24.276 --> 17:25.542
And then some.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.821
Mm, what do you
think you're doing?

17:36.823 --> 17:38.823
You wanted to go in the hot tub.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.458
Changed my mind.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.392
Too bad.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.460
I'm ready.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.362
Put your fucking suit on.

17:45.063 --> 17:46.364
All right, already.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.146
See you later.

18:20.832 --> 18:21.699
Oh.

18:22.835 --> 18:23.768
What's up, player?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.336
Good morning.

18:26.071 --> 18:28.372
I thought iTunes was
against your religion.

18:29.074 --> 18:30.141
No.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.909
The lord loves music.

18:31.911 --> 18:32.643
Oh.

18:32.645 --> 18:33.811
So what do you got on that?

18:33.813 --> 18:35.546
Like, motorhead or?

18:36.648 --> 18:38.215
Book of psalms.

18:39.251 --> 18:40.217
Oh, seriously?

18:40.219 --> 18:41.752
Um-hum.

18:42.220 --> 18:45.356
I find it very inspiring
when I go for a nature hike.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.459
All right then.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.493
Carry on.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.262
Peace be with you, Tedi.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.563
You too, kiddo.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.740
What's up, dude?

19:03.241 --> 19:04.342
Morning.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.345
Looks like someone got
some ass last night.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.047
That's kind of a personal
matter, don't you think?

19:10.049 --> 19:11.582
Not if you have ears, it's not.

19:13.685 --> 19:17.288
Hey, you ever play that
game ass, Cooter, mouth?

19:17.290 --> 19:19.490
Ass, Cooter, mouth, uh, no.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.459
I can't say that I have.
How do you play?

19:21.461 --> 19:24.061
Well, you give me a
number one through three,

19:24.063 --> 19:27.131
and I try and guess which hole
you stuck it in last night.

19:28.066 --> 19:29.767
What if I say all three?

19:30.635 --> 19:32.370
What if I say high five?

19:33.238 --> 19:34.338
Smack.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.041
Not necessarily in
that order though.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.542
You're all right, man.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.644
You're a fucking douchebag.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.712
Heard that.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.547
Good morning, lira.

19:44.449 --> 19:46.550
I said, good morning, lira.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.120
Good morning, Tedi.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.889
Hey, you know that expression,
'that girl's got spunk'?

19:53.225 --> 19:54.358
Yeah.

19:54.659 --> 19:56.160
Well, when they say it about you

19:56.162 --> 19:57.762
I think they mean
it quite literally.

20:01.666 --> 20:03.367
It's called toothpaste, dipshit.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.502
You should try it.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.669
Yeah, I will.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.271
I do that after
I have my coffee.

20:07.273 --> 20:10.307
That way I get that clean
mouth feeling all day.

20:11.209 --> 20:13.310
Do you know where they
keep the toothpicks?

20:13.445 --> 20:14.245
Yeah.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.514
Joel's got one between his legs.

20:17.015 --> 20:17.681
Right?

20:17.683 --> 20:18.649
Hey, buddy.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.050
Can I kill him, Dale,

20:20.052 --> 20:20.450
please?

20:20.452 --> 20:22.887
Not unless you find
me a new programmer.

20:23.488 --> 20:25.790
Tedi's kind of like that
fat guy in Jurassic park.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.758
We loose him and all
hell breaks loose.

20:28.160 --> 20:28.659
Yeah.

20:28.661 --> 20:31.395
If it wasn't for me, you'd
be up to your dick sucker

20:31.397 --> 20:32.530
in dinosaurs.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.267
Let me know if you
change your mind.

20:36.468 --> 20:37.468
I'm making omelets.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.569
Who wants one?

20:38.837 --> 20:40.171
No thanks.

20:40.472 --> 20:42.139
Oh, god, Dale. No.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.642
What's wrong with my omelets.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.843
They're made with love.

20:49.047 --> 20:49.780
Whoa.

20:51.049 --> 20:52.283
What happened to you?

20:58.190 --> 20:59.123
What?

21:01.426 --> 21:02.293
What?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.232
Psalm 23,
the lord is my Shepherd,

21:08.234 --> 21:09.333
<i>I shall not want.</i>

21:10.635 --> 21:13.537
He makes me to lie
down in green pastures.

21:13.805 --> 21:16.340
He leads me beside
the still waters.

21:17.042 --> 21:19.143
<i>He restoreth my soul.</i>

21:19.811 --> 21:23.714
He leads me in paths of
righteousness for his namesake.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.252
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

21:28.254 --> 21:31.889
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

21:33.058 --> 21:36.126
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

21:37.262 --> 21:41.265
Thou preparest a table for me in
the presence of mine enemies.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.367
Thou anointest my head with oil.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.569
<i>My cup runeth over.</i>

21:46.471 --> 21:48.706
Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow

21:48.708 --> 21:50.541
<i>me all the days of my life.</i>

21:51.610 --> 21:55.145
And I shall dwell in the
house of the lord forever.

22:03.288 --> 22:05.155
All right. Who's missing?

22:06.258 --> 22:07.324
Not me.

22:07.659 --> 22:08.759
Anybody seen Rita?

22:08.960 --> 22:09.693
Uh, yeah.

22:09.695 --> 22:11.262
She went for a jog this morning.

22:11.264 --> 22:13.097
Did she say where she was going?

22:13.099 --> 22:14.097
Fuck if I know.

22:14.099 --> 22:16.267
She probably went to
find Jesus or something.

22:16.269 --> 22:17.768
Should we wait for her?

22:18.021 --> 22:18.470
Uh, no.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.437
We've covered most
of this already.

22:20.439 --> 22:21.739
I'll just fill her in
when she gets back.

22:21.741 --> 22:22.139
Yeah.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.542
Let's get this
party started, huh?

22:25.043 --> 22:26.744
Let's get down to business.

22:27.245 --> 22:29.213
I'd like to start off
by saying thank you

22:29.215 --> 22:31.248
to all of you for the
past quarter's extra work.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.083
I really appreciate
all your effort.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.285
You're welcome.

22:34.287 --> 22:34.585
Okay.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.654
My design team, you're
going to be happy to know,

22:36.656 --> 22:38.556
your prayers are
finally being answered.

22:38.823 --> 22:40.491
You're transferring Tedi?

22:41.661 --> 22:45.496
Oh, forest, you break my heart.

22:45.498 --> 22:50.534
Oh, we still love you,
Tedi, just from far away.

22:51.269 --> 22:53.170
Like a fine work of art.

22:53.838 --> 22:56.173
Yeah, something like that.

22:57.409 --> 23:00.277
I'm upgrading your
workstations with the new Imacs.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.780
Retina display, flash
drives, the whole deal.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.381
Yes.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.050
I thought you'd like that.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.050
What about storage?

23:07.052 --> 23:09.687
Um, I'll have to look
into it, but storage is cheap.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.755
It shouldn't be a problem
getting it authorized.

23:12.223 --> 23:14.458
Hey, uh, what about
loosening up Websense?

23:14.460 --> 23:16.660
I mean, it's not like I
can't hack through that shit

23:16.662 --> 23:17.695
if I wanted to.

23:17.697 --> 23:18.796
You know I could.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.831
I just... why waste
my time, you know?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.833
You only want them
to take down Websense,

23:22.835 --> 23:24.368
so you can look at porn.

23:24.469 --> 23:27.471
Whoa, it is not my fault the
server crashes every time

23:27.473 --> 23:29.740
I try and download
your sex tape.

23:30.241 --> 23:31.542
You're going to die.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.144
Lira.

23:37.248 --> 23:41.352
Children, could you
come back to the table?

23:57.669 --> 24:02.272
All of a sudden came the thunder
of hooves rushing up the path.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.476
A dark figure in a black cloak

24:05.478 --> 24:07.745
rode it's horse
toward the porch.

24:08.446 --> 24:11.382
The old man walked
down the front stairs.

24:11.516 --> 24:14.051
And the cloaked figure stopped
his horse just outside

24:14.053 --> 24:16.086
the pool of light
that was being cast

24:16.088 --> 24:18.489
by the lanterns
hung above the porch.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.460
The old man staggered back.

24:23.462 --> 24:27.331
Shot twice, once in the neck
and the other in his chest.

24:29.434 --> 24:31.535
The dark figure rose
up onto his horse

24:32.070 --> 24:34.538
and fled down the Lane
disappearing into the night.

24:35.674 --> 24:37.608
Friends rushed to
the old man's aid,

24:37.610 --> 24:39.877
but it was already too late.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.415
The first shot had bored
a quarter sized hole.

24:44.417 --> 24:45.449
Now's your chance.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.417
To a chamber...

24:46.419 --> 24:48.085
What the hell are
you talking about?

24:48.087 --> 24:50.754
Chicks get super turned
on when they're scared.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.257
Like you would know.

24:53.259 --> 24:53.757
Trust me.

24:53.759 --> 24:58.162
Both times I scored the chick
was either drunk or scared.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.364
I think one of the
times she was both.

25:04.469 --> 25:05.636
Alright.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.137
Hey, hey, Zac?

25:07.139 --> 25:08.706
Just in case.

25:09.274 --> 25:10.474
Thanks, Tedi.

25:10.476 --> 25:11.642
Do you guys mind?

25:11.644 --> 25:12.142
No.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.812
Sorry. It was just getting
really good, Dale.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.547
Please continue.

25:17.048 --> 25:17.781
Thanks.

25:17.783 --> 25:22.653
Now as I was saying,
so much blood

25:22.655 --> 25:26.457
poured from the old man's
wounds that a thick pool

25:26.459 --> 25:28.358
formed underneath his head.

25:29.627 --> 25:30.694
He coughed once.

25:32.664 --> 25:33.797
And then again,

25:33.799 --> 25:37.101
the second being
a hideous gurgling

25:37.103 --> 25:39.470
sound as though
two invisible hands

25:39.472 --> 25:42.740
were choking the old
man to death,

25:43.441 --> 25:45.876
squeezing the very
life out of him.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.613
The sound sent a shiver
up the spines of everyone

25:49.615 --> 25:55.285
who heard the old man's
last dying breath.

26:05.096 --> 26:06.130
Hey.

26:06.664 --> 26:08.499
Dale's ghost story
getting to you?

26:08.501 --> 26:08.899
Oh yeah.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.468
I'm going to have
nightmares for weeks.

26:11.470 --> 26:12.469
Here.

26:12.471 --> 26:13.737
I brought you some Pinot.

26:14.439 --> 26:16.440
Trying to get me liquored up?

26:16.442 --> 26:17.474
Maybe.

26:17.476 --> 26:18.742
Is it working?

26:19.611 --> 26:20.744
Maybe.

26:21.446 --> 26:22.646
This is really good.

26:22.648 --> 26:24.548
Compliments of Mr. sau.

26:25.049 --> 26:28.285
You know, I was a little
taken back by him joining us

26:28.287 --> 26:29.887
on our little retreat
here, but, um,

26:30.421 --> 26:32.556
now I'm starting to think it
might have its benefits.

26:33.258 --> 26:36.760
Having a rich boyfriend
does have its advantages.

26:37.662 --> 26:38.595
Are you sure?

26:40.665 --> 26:42.332
I wouldn't know.

26:42.667 --> 26:45.536
I'm a 'two buck
Chuck' type of girl.

26:50.475 --> 26:51.742
You okay?

26:52.410 --> 26:53.644
Yeah.

26:53.646 --> 26:54.745
I'm all right.

26:56.447 --> 26:57.247
No.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.549
There's something wrong.

26:59.050 --> 27:00.484
I see it in your eyes.

27:00.486 --> 27:01.351
Oh.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.821
You can read my
eyes now, can you?

27:03.823 --> 27:04.558
Yeah. I can.

27:05.456 --> 27:07.758
I bet you can't even tell
me what color they are.

27:09.828 --> 27:10.328
Well?

27:19.839 --> 27:21.471
<i>They are brown.</i>

27:21.473 --> 27:23.106
I know. I'm just
messing with you.

27:23.108 --> 27:25.442
And you stole that
from AXL rose.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.177
How do you know he
didn't steal that from me?

27:27.179 --> 27:28.712
Because you're
not that sensitive.

27:28.714 --> 27:30.214
I am sensitive, dammit.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.216
As if AXL rose is
Mr. sensitivity.

27:32.218 --> 27:35.419
Hey, I'm sure he's a nice
guy once you get to know him.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.120
That's like saying
he's an asshole,

27:37.122 --> 27:38.455
but you'll get to used to it.

27:38.457 --> 27:38.955
No it's not.

27:38.957 --> 27:41.458
He once threw a girl
down a flight of stairs.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.828
Well, I'm sure he
had good reason to.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.330
Yeah, he did.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.233
Because she wouldn't
sleep with him.

27:49.235 --> 27:50.267
That will do it.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.469
That is not funny.

27:52.471 --> 27:53.437
That is...

27:53.439 --> 27:55.072
Why, why are you laughing?

27:55.074 --> 27:56.807
I am not laughing.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.141
I see that.

27:58.443 --> 28:00.110
Damn you, Zac.

28:00.645 --> 28:03.046
Why do you always have
this messed up way

28:03.048 --> 28:04.715
of making me feel better?

28:05.416 --> 28:07.150
I don't know how you do it.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.154
Are you going to tell me
what's wrong?

28:12.056 --> 28:14.892
Rita's not back yet.

28:15.660 --> 28:16.894
Are you sure?

28:16.896 --> 28:21.331
I thought she was just avoiding
Dale's tale of the occult in there.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.300
I'm pretty sure, Zac.

28:23.302 --> 28:25.135
She's been gone all day.

28:26.437 --> 28:28.105
Have you told Dale?

28:28.107 --> 28:29.172
No.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.541
I didn't want to spoil his fun.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.510
A whole hell of a lot of fun.

28:36.214 --> 28:37.748
Should we go back in?

28:38.583 --> 28:39.750
If we have to.

28:46.724 --> 28:49.726
From that day on the servants
couldn't keep the porch clean.

28:51.262 --> 28:53.463
Every few weeks a
damp pool of blood

28:53.465 --> 28:57.734
would appear in the same spot
where the old man had died.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.671
They tried repainting
the porch several times,

29:00.673 --> 29:04.107
but the blood stain would
always bleed through.

29:05.643 --> 29:07.778
One night one of the
servants saw something

29:07.780 --> 29:09.279
that caused him to go mad.

29:11.449 --> 29:14.451
Folks said that the
house was haunted

29:14.453 --> 29:16.753
by the angry spirit
of the old man.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.222
The house was sold
several times,

29:19.224 --> 29:21.525
but each time the
residents were driven out

29:22.427 --> 29:26.697
by the horrible gasping
breaths of the old man's ghost

29:26.699 --> 29:29.766
and the hideous blood stain
that could never be removed.

29:30.468 --> 29:35.539
The house was eventually
abandoned until just last year.

29:36.641 --> 29:38.542
One year ago today, in fact.

29:39.043 --> 29:45.349
When it was completely remodeled
and turned into Tearlon lodge.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.753
You're so full of it, Dale.

29:50.254 --> 29:51.688
I had you going.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.824
I don't know. I thought
the story was pretty good.

29:53.826 --> 29:57.694
Up until the end because I
think I heard that one before.

29:57.696 --> 29:58.895
Yeah?

29:59.464 --> 30:01.398
Good one, d, although I think

30:01.400 --> 30:03.266
you've got to give
partial credit to Joel.

30:03.268 --> 30:04.835
The wine definitely helped.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.536
Yeah, it's something else.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.472
You have any more?

30:08.474 --> 30:08.872
Yeah.

30:08.874 --> 30:11.274
I got a whole case of it.
I'll go get you some some more.

30:11.276 --> 30:12.709
Let him get it himself.

30:13.077 --> 30:14.511
Don't be a bitch, babe.

30:15.446 --> 30:16.747
Excuse me?

30:17.215 --> 30:19.649
He said don't be a bitch, bitch.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.220
Did you want any more?

30:23.222 --> 30:24.354
- Sure.
- Okay.

30:30.461 --> 30:31.328
Dale?

30:32.263 --> 30:33.163
Hey.

30:33.264 --> 30:34.831
You missed my finale.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.833
I'm sure you didn't disappoint.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.668
Yeah, but every
great storyteller

30:38.670 --> 30:41.805
saves his best for last.

30:41.807 --> 30:44.274
I'm worried about Rita.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.277
She hasn't come back yet
and she's been gone all day.

30:47.279 --> 30:48.378
Did you try her cell?

30:48.380 --> 30:50.313
No, I can't get a signal.

30:50.315 --> 30:51.715
Yeah, me either.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.250
Has anybody seen Rita?

30:53.252 --> 30:54.317
Yeah, I did.

30:54.319 --> 30:56.253
She got eaten by a bear.

30:56.255 --> 30:56.653
Tedi.

30:56.655 --> 30:59.189
Can you be serious
for one fucking minute?

30:59.191 --> 31:00.424
No.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.160
Which one's Rita again?

31:03.162 --> 31:07.431
She's a dark hair, skinny
chick, huge bug in her ass.

31:07.433 --> 31:08.298
Oh, yeah.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.666
I remember her.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.668
Yo, money bags, pass the hammer.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.437
Thank you.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.639
I really think we
should look for her.

31:15.641 --> 31:16.706
Wait a second.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.175
She comes up here all the time.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.243
She might have just gone to
visit with the caretaker.

31:20.245 --> 31:22.813
Well, is there any
way we can contact him?

31:22.815 --> 31:24.381
I don't think he
even has a phone.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.783
I kind of get the impression he
prefers to live off the grid.

31:27.485 --> 31:29.019
Well, what if Zac and
I go and look for her?

31:29.021 --> 31:29.419
No.

31:29.421 --> 31:32.622
I can't have you two traipsing
off in the middle of the night.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.458
You could get lost, or
fall in a bear trap,

31:34.460 --> 31:37.294
or god knows what else.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.529
If she's not back by the
morning we'll go look for her.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.298
- Okay?
- Alright.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.667
That goes for everybody.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.335
Even Joel?

31:45.337 --> 31:49.072
Yes, even Joel.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.208
With that, I'm going to
get some sleep.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.376
This wine's done a number on me.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.412
I need to hit the hay.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.814
Try to keep it down
to a dull roar.

31:57.816 --> 31:59.182
Good night, Dale.

31:59.184 --> 32:00.283
Night, bud.

32:00.285 --> 32:01.151
Goodnight.

32:01.153 --> 32:01.851
Night.

32:01.853 --> 32:05.088
Good night. I'm glad
you liked the wine.

32:05.090 --> 32:08.458
Well, can I refreshen
your glass, your majesty?

32:08.460 --> 32:10.660
Please.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.262
Whoa, that's good. Thank you.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.697
You're welcome.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.465
Here, babe.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.334
Seriously, Joel, enough.

32:19.303 --> 32:21.071
You're no good to me
when you're like this.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.205
Oh, come on.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.074
It's better when you're drunk.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.609
Not for me it's not.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.710
Whoa.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.079
Tough woman to please, huh?

32:29.081 --> 32:31.681
Buddy, you ain't kidding.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.718
I'm going to my room.

32:40.424 --> 32:42.125
Are you coming?

32:43.227 --> 32:46.730
Joel, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

32:47.832 --> 32:49.499
Not you, mongoloid.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.234
I'll be up in a minute, babe.

32:51.236 --> 32:52.369
Yeah. Fuck you.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.506
I'd get up there if I were you.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.508
The longer you wait.

32:58.809 --> 33:02.546
The bitchier she gets.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.515
Too much to drink, Tedi boy.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.150
All right.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.352
Well, on that note.

33:10.454 --> 33:12.455
All right. I'll see
you guys later.

33:12.457 --> 33:15.458
Adios, amigos and, uh, feel free
to drink the rest of the wine.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.660
- Thank you.
- It's all yours.

33:16.662 --> 33:17.494
Good night.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.496
No. Wait, oh god.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.131
I'm going to join you.

33:22.433 --> 33:24.067
Oh, oh.

33:24.069 --> 33:25.168
I got you.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.169
I got you, big boy.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.537
Okay.

33:27.539 --> 33:28.638
There we go.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.138
Up the stairs.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.641
Hey, do you and lira
have any plans tonight?

33:31.643 --> 33:32.041
Yeah.

33:32.043 --> 33:36.079
I'm going to bury my sword so
deep in that stone-cold bitch,

33:36.081 --> 33:38.248
the first person who pulls it
out's going to get declared

33:38.250 --> 33:39.449
the king of England.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.717
Brothers.

33:41.652 --> 33:43.820
What are you two
jibber jabbering about?

33:43.822 --> 33:46.256
Just, just guy talk.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.093
Got you, buddy. Careful.

33:50.095 --> 33:52.562
Someone's going to break
their neck on those things.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.431
Yeah, watch out.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.466
Tedi, isn't your
room downstairs?

33:56.468 --> 33:59.302
I thought we were going to tag
team like the Hardy boys?

33:59.704 --> 34:02.272
No three way for you tonight,
bud. Sorry.

34:02.274 --> 34:03.740
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.508
He's got two hands.

34:06.444 --> 34:08.143
Lira makes a joke.

34:08.646 --> 34:09.545
Tops.

34:14.452 --> 34:15.752
All right.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.688
Well, about time for
you to be hitting

34:18.690 --> 34:20.223
the old dusty trail, right?

34:20.225 --> 34:21.491
Yeah. I'm going to go.

34:21.493 --> 34:22.559
Good choice.

34:22.827 --> 34:26.563
You, uh, slay that
fire-breathing cocksucker.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.130
Bye.

34:28.565 --> 34:30.100
Are you, you okay?

34:30.101 --> 34:31.167
Yeah.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.402
Hey, Zac.

34:33.437 --> 34:34.536
Looking good.

34:47.318 --> 34:50.520
I think everyone's going
to get some action tonight.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.054
Good night, Tedi.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.157
Please.

34:54.159 --> 34:55.257
Good night. Go.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.426
Fine.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.362
But long live the
king of Arthur.

35:00.665 --> 35:06.336
Long live the... long live king Arthur.

35:07.071 --> 35:08.505
Long live the king.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.140
He is nuts.

35:10.775 --> 35:11.708
Fucking loon.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.549
You know you worry too much.

35:20.351 --> 35:22.152
You're probably right.

35:22.420 --> 35:24.120
There's no probably to it.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.522
I'm always right.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.891
How could I forget?

35:28.492 --> 35:29.526
It happens.

35:38.469 --> 35:42.272
Um, you gonna come upstairs?

35:42.274 --> 35:43.573
Not yet.

35:44.442 --> 35:46.343
I'm going to wait
here for a while.

35:46.644 --> 35:49.145
See if Rita straggles in.

35:51.248 --> 35:52.182
All right.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.191
Don't stay up all night.

36:01.459 --> 36:02.559
I won't.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.362
Good night, Zac.

36:06.097 --> 36:07.564
Good night, Meigan.

36:39.296 --> 36:40.330
Rita?

36:42.666 --> 36:43.566
Rita?

36:48.272 --> 36:49.572
Are you in here?

36:50.074 --> 36:51.107
Rita?

37:18.637 --> 37:19.702
What was that?

37:19.704 --> 37:21.471
Shut up, Joel.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.839
Yeah.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.774
It was probably nothing.

39:05.643 --> 39:08.244
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

39:08.246 --> 39:09.445
<i>I fucking hate you!</i>

39:09.447 --> 39:11.648
Tessa, calm down.

39:11.650 --> 39:15.251
Shut up! Shut
up! Leave me alone!

39:15.253 --> 39:16.152
You know
what happens if you don't

39:16.154 --> 39:17.453
<i>calm down, right?</i>

39:17.455 --> 39:19.055
<i>We'll have to sedate you.</i>

39:19.057 --> 39:20.456
I'm going to kill you!

39:20.458 --> 39:23.359
<i>I'm going to kill you.</i>

39:39.610 --> 39:40.643
Hey.

39:40.645 --> 39:41.644
Jeez.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.079
Relax. It's just me.

39:43.081 --> 39:44.180
What are you trying to do?

39:44.182 --> 39:44.914
Scare me to death?

39:44.916 --> 39:45.414
Scare you?

39:45.416 --> 39:48.084
You're the one creeping
around in the fucking attic.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.652
I thought Hugo had gotten loose.

39:49.654 --> 39:51.454
I was halfway down
to the bait shop

39:51.456 --> 39:53.256
to pick up a bucket
of fish heads.

39:53.258 --> 39:54.257
Sorry.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.692
Hey, are you going
to come to bed?

39:55.694 --> 39:57.660
Think the fuck-a-thon
next door is over,

39:57.662 --> 40:00.063
so you and I actually
might get some sleep.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.365
Finally, some good news.

40:02.833 --> 40:05.301
What the hell are you
doing in the attic anyway?

40:08.105 --> 40:09.372
I don't know.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.275
All right, weirdo.

40:12.277 --> 40:13.242
Come on.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.143
Okay.

40:28.459 --> 40:30.360
Kill her.

40:32.796 --> 40:35.365
She lies.

40:35.566 --> 40:36.532
Who?

40:40.671 --> 40:41.771
Who?

40:43.674 --> 40:44.474
Hey.

40:44.476 --> 40:45.742
You all right, Zac?

40:47.044 --> 40:48.111
Yeah.

40:48.646 --> 40:49.545
You sure?

40:50.447 --> 40:51.514
Uh huh.

40:54.451 --> 40:56.352
Is Meigan in there with you?

40:59.256 --> 41:00.156
No.

41:02.259 --> 41:04.160
She's not into you, you know.

41:05.229 --> 41:06.362
Excuse me?

41:06.664 --> 41:09.165
I know you've got
this huge crush on her.

41:10.067 --> 41:11.534
It's totally obvious.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.570
But she's not over her ex.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.342
Girls just kind of a sixth
sense about this sort of thing.

41:20.210 --> 41:22.111
You know, I'll bet she
even tried to call him

41:22.113 --> 41:23.346
while she was up here.

41:25.449 --> 41:26.482
Maybe.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.651
I don't know about you,
but that sure as hell

41:28.653 --> 41:30.553
would bug the shit out of me.

41:31.455 --> 41:35.758
Being all alone at night
next to the one you ache for.

41:36.460 --> 41:40.129
Being so close, yet so far.

41:41.432 --> 41:43.766
I bet that's got
you all pent up.

41:45.102 --> 41:46.469
What are you doing?

41:46.471 --> 41:48.337
What does it look
like I'm doing?

41:51.442 --> 41:52.675
What about your boyfriend?

41:52.677 --> 41:54.544
He's not my boyfriend.

41:54.546 --> 41:56.546
But we can sport fuck at best.

41:57.247 --> 41:59.148
You'd still be cheating on Joel.

42:00.084 --> 42:02.518
You know, I never really
liked the term cheating.

42:02.820 --> 42:05.555
Makes it sound like I'm
playing some sort of game.

42:06.423 --> 42:07.590
Aren't you?

42:08.058 --> 42:08.791
What?

42:10.227 --> 42:11.360
Playing a game.

42:13.664 --> 42:18.134
If I win the game,
do I get a prize?

42:21.305 --> 42:22.705
Have you seen the Excedrin?

42:22.707 --> 42:24.540
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

42:25.743 --> 42:27.543
You okay?

42:28.145 --> 42:29.545
I don't want to talk about it.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.094
Meigan, please calm down.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.596
Well, she still
isn't back yet, Dale.

42:46.598 --> 42:48.197
It's time someone worry.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.366
Hey, I wasn't
disagreeing with you, okay?

42:50.368 --> 42:51.667
Just don't get all panicky.

42:51.669 --> 42:52.802
We'll find her.

42:52.804 --> 42:54.270
It's been 24 hours.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.772
Obviously something's wrong.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.707
Rita never came back?

42:57.709 --> 42:58.474
No.

42:58.476 --> 42:59.675
We have to go look for her.

42:59.677 --> 43:00.643
Where's Tedi?

43:00.645 --> 43:02.044
Tedi?

43:02.046 --> 43:02.644
Tedi?

43:02.646 --> 43:04.480
Stop yelling, Dale.
I'm right here.

43:04.482 --> 43:06.282
Okay. There you are.
Get your shoes on.

43:06.284 --> 43:07.750
You've got to come with me
and find the caretaker.

43:07.752 --> 43:09.352
Let's see if maybe
seen Rita around.

43:09.354 --> 43:11.454
I'm in no condition
to go for a hike.

43:11.456 --> 43:14.056
Get your shoes on now or
spend the rest of the trip

43:14.058 --> 43:15.691
prying my foot out of your ass.

43:15.693 --> 43:17.293
Aye aye, captain.

43:17.295 --> 43:20.263
Zac, I need you to check
around the lake for me.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.564
You got it, boss.

43:22.666 --> 43:25.067
Lira, I want you to check
the local hiking trails.

43:25.069 --> 43:26.269
There's a map in my room.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.470
You can use that.

43:27.472 --> 43:29.438
You want to go tramping
through the woods?

43:29.440 --> 43:30.640
Yes, I do.

43:30.642 --> 43:31.574
And take Joel with you.

43:31.576 --> 43:33.075
You'll cover more
ground that way.

43:33.077 --> 43:34.143
All right.

43:34.411 --> 43:35.545
Fuck.

43:36.814 --> 43:38.347
Bitch.

43:39.049 --> 43:41.450
Meigan, I need you to stay here
just in case she comes back.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.085
I'm not staying here.

43:43.087 --> 43:44.487
I want to help you guys.

43:44.489 --> 43:45.321
I know you do.

43:45.323 --> 43:46.823
That's why I want
you here, okay?

43:46.825 --> 43:49.592
If she's hurt or needs anything,
or something happens to us,

43:49.594 --> 43:52.094
I need someone here
I can count on. Okay?

43:52.096 --> 43:54.397
You want me to leave
that to lira, or Tedi?

43:55.232 --> 43:56.299
Guess not.

43:56.301 --> 43:58.301
And keep your phone on
just in the off chance

43:58.303 --> 43:59.368
you get a signal.

43:59.370 --> 44:00.670
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:00.672 --> 44:01.404
Tedi, let's go.

44:01.406 --> 44:02.271
<i>I'm coming.</i>

44:02.273 --> 44:04.740
No, not... move it, now, buddy.

44:05.642 --> 44:06.509
Good luck.

44:13.817 --> 44:15.051
What?

44:15.053 --> 44:16.552
What was that back there?

44:17.254 --> 44:18.287
With what?

44:18.289 --> 44:20.156
With that guy, Zac.

44:20.457 --> 44:23.392
Fucking Christ, Joel, not now.

44:24.512 --> 44:25.062
Oh, what?

44:25.063 --> 44:28.130
You going to have a conniption
fit or something?

44:28.632 --> 44:30.166
Or something.

44:30.467 --> 44:31.667
What's your problem?

44:31.669 --> 44:33.135
What was that back there?

44:33.137 --> 44:34.136
We were just talking.

44:34.138 --> 44:35.338
Bull shit.

44:37.741 --> 44:39.508
- Joel.
- I saw you.

44:42.446 --> 44:44.280
What are you saying?

44:44.282 --> 44:45.715
You know what I'm saying.

44:51.822 --> 44:53.756
He tried to kiss me.

44:58.228 --> 44:59.762
He came out onto the porch.

45:00.464 --> 45:02.131
He looked like
something was wrong.

45:02.133 --> 45:04.367
So I went over to
see if he was okay.

45:05.269 --> 45:06.669
And one thing led to another.

45:06.671 --> 45:09.338
I guess he took that as me
coming onto him or something.

45:12.209 --> 45:14.543
And it's not the first
time it's happened either.

45:15.812 --> 45:18.047
He does this all
the time at work.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.348
It's disgusting.

45:21.652 --> 45:23.219
Why don't you tell Dale?

45:23.221 --> 45:25.354
I did the first
time it happened.

45:26.223 --> 45:28.357
It's just my word against his.

45:29.459 --> 45:31.260
And Dale likes him.

45:31.262 --> 45:33.562
Everybody in the office does.

45:34.231 --> 45:35.364
Including you?

45:37.234 --> 45:39.502
What the hell kind of a
person do you think I am?

45:39.504 --> 45:42.672
There's something seriously
wrong with that guy.

45:42.674 --> 45:45.074
He's on all kinds of medication.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.509
He literally scares me.

45:49.813 --> 45:52.348
I just didn't want to because
any trouble or anything.

45:56.653 --> 45:58.154
Don't you trust me?

46:00.624 --> 46:03.125
I don't feel safe around him.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.261
Hey, I'm sorry. Okay?

46:05.263 --> 46:06.462
No.

46:06.464 --> 46:07.730
Don't touch me.

46:11.234 --> 46:13.469
Why don't you be a man
and do something about it

46:13.471 --> 46:16.539
instead of tearing me down
with your bullshit accusations?

46:28.185 --> 46:29.318
Rita?

46:29.653 --> 46:31.687
Ricola?

46:31.689 --> 46:33.155
Bad joke, Tedi.

46:35.492 --> 46:36.659
Rita?

46:36.661 --> 46:37.560
Rita?

46:39.663 --> 46:41.130
Jesus?

46:43.667 --> 46:45.334
Worth a shot, right?

46:50.674 --> 46:52.541
You looking for birds?

46:53.043 --> 46:54.110
Bingo.

46:54.678 --> 46:55.745
Come on.

46:58.415 --> 47:00.249
Hey, I'm hungry, Dale.

47:00.251 --> 47:01.717
Yeah. We'll eat later.

47:09.126 --> 47:11.060
Should probably knock first.

47:11.062 --> 47:12.361
Why? The door's open.

47:15.665 --> 47:16.732
Anybody home?

47:18.668 --> 47:19.902
Earl ray?

47:20.670 --> 47:22.338
I don't think he's home.

47:24.553 --> 47:25.409
Door's locked.

47:25.410 --> 47:28.744
Why would the door be
locked if no one was here?

47:30.247 --> 47:31.280
Rita?

47:31.282 --> 47:32.348
You in there?

47:32.816 --> 47:34.150
Rita?

47:34.618 --> 47:36.485
If anybody's in
there, can you open up?

47:36.487 --> 47:37.787
We're missing one of our group.

47:37.789 --> 47:38.788
We need help.

47:38.790 --> 47:39.688
She can't hear us.

47:39.690 --> 47:40.723
I'm breaking it down.

47:40.725 --> 47:42.258
Easy, Tedi. This
isn't our house.

47:42.260 --> 47:44.126
You can't just go breaking
people's doors down.

47:44.128 --> 47:45.661
She's probably bound and gagged.

47:45.663 --> 47:47.430
There's blood and shit
all over the place.

47:47.432 --> 47:48.697
We can't just
leave her in there.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.366
We don't even know she's here.

47:53.670 --> 47:54.670
Rita?

47:54.672 --> 47:56.338
Quit fucking around.

47:58.275 --> 48:00.042
Just find this Earl ray guy.

48:00.044 --> 48:01.710
It's probably just a
big misunderstanding.

49:32.702 --> 49:35.471
"Investigators baffled by
brutal crime at a private"

49:35.473 --> 49:38.474
psychiatric hospital in the
mountains near Tearlon lake

49:38.476 --> 49:41.644
a female patient age nine, whose
name cannot be disclosed

49:41.646 --> 49:45.247
was allegedly attacked and brutally
mutilated by a male patient

49:45.249 --> 49:46.682
of the same age.

49:46.684 --> 49:48.050
According to the police report

49:48.052 --> 49:50.619
most of the girl's tongue
had been cut out

49:50.621 --> 49:52.655
with a pair of
surgical scissors.

49:52.657 --> 49:54.823
Registered sex offender
Earl ray Warren,

49:54.825 --> 49:57.426
who had been working as an
orderly at the Tearlon lake

49:57.428 --> 49:59.195
psychiatric hospital
was brought in

49:59.197 --> 50:01.530
for questioning after
investigators discovered

50:01.532 --> 50:05.334
shocking evidence of torture,
deprivation, and child abuse.

50:05.635 --> 50:08.470
Renowned psychiatrist
Dr. Herman Rexif

50:08.472 --> 50:10.673
has resigned as head
physician of the hospital

50:10.675 --> 50:13.108
and has refused to
answer any questions.

50:13.810 --> 50:16.178
"No charges have been
filed at this time."

50:24.588 --> 50:27.156
"Earl ray Warren was
released from police custody"

50:27.158 --> 50:30.726
yesterday after the conclusion
of the month-long investigation.

50:31.161 --> 50:33.829
Authorities could not produce
any evidence of wrongdoing,

50:33.831 --> 50:37.066
although Warren, age 46,
admitted to many bizarre

50:37.068 --> 50:40.236
and cruel methods of negative
reinforcement in the care

50:40.238 --> 50:41.670
and treatment of children,

50:41.672 --> 50:44.807
including a chamber
known only as the box,

50:44.809 --> 50:48.043
a tiny metal cell where children
were placed in isolation

50:48.045 --> 50:50.279
sometimes for days at a time.

50:50.281 --> 50:54.283
"It was done only on the direct
orders of the trained medical staff."

51:27.651 --> 51:30.119
So what'd you do today?

51:30.121 --> 51:31.553
<i>Colored.</i>

51:32.122 --> 51:34.323
Is this what you drew?

51:34.891 --> 51:35.824
You drew this?

51:35.826 --> 51:36.759
Yes.

51:39.195 --> 51:40.829
It's very good.

51:40.831 --> 51:42.264
Thank you.

51:42.266 --> 51:43.732
Is this your family?

51:44.668 --> 51:45.768
Yeah.

51:46.836 --> 51:48.671
Why are they on the ground?

51:48.673 --> 51:49.738
They're dead.

51:51.808 --> 51:53.542
How did they die?

51:54.210 --> 51:55.878
I don't know.

51:56.813 --> 51:58.714
Are you lying to me, Ned?

51:59.482 --> 52:00.649
I never lie.

52:00.651 --> 52:02.484
Then how did they die?

52:02.486 --> 52:03.652
God punished them.

52:03.654 --> 52:04.687
Why?

52:04.689 --> 52:06.522
He hates liars.

52:11.194 --> 52:13.162
Did you color anything else?

52:13.463 --> 52:13.862
No.

52:13.864 --> 52:17.533
The other kids came in, so
we went back to our room.

52:17.667 --> 52:20.169
So you weren't coloring alone.

52:20.603 --> 52:22.104
I'm never alone.

52:22.106 --> 52:23.272
Who was with you?

52:23.274 --> 52:25.507
The one the others
are afraid of.

52:26.576 --> 52:28.377
Does he have a name?

52:29.079 --> 52:29.778
I can't tell you.

52:29.780 --> 52:30.679
Why?

52:30.681 --> 52:32.348
He'll hurt me.

52:33.416 --> 52:35.351
Like he hurt Sarah?

52:35.652 --> 52:36.885
Not like that.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.721
I don't know what he'll do.

52:41.257 --> 52:44.126
Did you see Sarah today?

52:44.828 --> 52:45.694
Yeah.

52:45.696 --> 52:47.296
She came into my room.

52:47.298 --> 52:48.364
What for?

52:49.432 --> 52:51.533
To wish me a happy birthday.

52:52.335 --> 52:54.203
I didn't realize it
was your birthday.

52:54.205 --> 52:55.738
Happy birthday, Ned.

52:56.506 --> 52:58.040
Thank you.

52:58.042 --> 53:00.109
Did she say anything else?

53:00.443 --> 53:02.678
She said my mommy was
downstairs with presents

53:02.680 --> 53:04.747
and a birthday cake.

53:05.248 --> 53:06.448
Well, would she say that?

53:06.450 --> 53:08.517
Nobody came to see you today.

53:09.219 --> 53:10.519
She lies.

53:12.822 --> 53:15.491
How long has it been
since you saw your parents?

53:15.493 --> 53:17.359
A long time ago.

53:17.660 --> 53:19.461
17 months since...

53:19.463 --> 53:21.163
I don't want to talk about this.

53:22.465 --> 53:23.766
Why not?

53:24.401 --> 53:25.768
It makes him angry.

53:36.079 --> 53:37.646
Dale, I really had a
feeling about that room.

53:37.648 --> 53:39.148
I think we should've gone in.

53:39.150 --> 53:41.316
We need more than a
feeling, Tedi, all right?

53:44.621 --> 53:45.454
Anything?

53:45.456 --> 53:46.655
Nothing. No sign of her.

53:46.657 --> 53:48.590
I was hoping she was back here.

53:49.058 --> 53:50.659
Did you find the caretaker?

53:50.661 --> 53:53.095
No. We found his cabin,
but nobody was home.

53:53.097 --> 53:54.530
It was strange.

53:55.265 --> 53:57.299
Didn't you say his
name was Warren?

53:57.301 --> 53:58.333
Yeah.

53:58.735 --> 54:00.235
Earl ray Warren?

54:00.237 --> 54:01.537
Yeah, why?

54:02.238 --> 54:04.239
- I think you need to see this.
- Later.

54:04.241 --> 54:06.241
We just came back to see
if she'd come back here.

54:06.243 --> 54:08.510
With her family connections,
if anything happens to her,

54:08.512 --> 54:10.245
I might as well kiss
this job goodbye.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.747
We're going to split up
until we find her.

54:11.749 --> 54:12.781
Or the old man.

54:12.783 --> 54:15.050
Okay. Well, be careful.
It could be dangerous.

54:15.052 --> 54:15.884
You, too.

54:24.394 --> 54:25.260
Fuck.

54:25.262 --> 54:26.395
God dammit, Zac.

54:26.397 --> 54:28.163
You've got to stop
doing that to me.

54:28.165 --> 54:29.097
Doing what?

54:29.099 --> 54:30.299
Scaring the shit out of me.

54:30.301 --> 54:32.334
You just backed into me.

54:33.670 --> 54:35.070
Any word on Rita?

54:35.072 --> 54:35.470
No.

54:35.472 --> 54:37.706
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.541
Where the hell could should be?

54:40.176 --> 54:42.711
I don't know, Zac, but I'm
really starting to worry.

54:44.214 --> 54:46.882
I think the caretaker
might be a child molester.

54:48.117 --> 54:49.318
What?

54:50.620 --> 54:54.756
I found this article and
the guy's a sex offender.

54:56.292 --> 54:58.794
Did, did you tell Dale?

54:58.796 --> 54:59.194
No.

54:59.196 --> 55:02.364
I, I tried to, but he's
gone back to keep looking.

55:03.266 --> 55:04.666
That's not even the worst of it.

55:04.668 --> 55:05.501
Look at this.

55:12.675 --> 55:14.576
Where did you get this?

55:16.646 --> 55:17.442
In the attic.

55:20.483 --> 55:24.119
This place used to be some
kind of mental hospital.

55:26.456 --> 55:29.157
Guess that explains why
they got the place so cheap.

55:29.526 --> 55:31.326
It's not funny.

55:31.794 --> 55:34.096
The authorities
shut this place down.

55:34.098 --> 55:36.365
They were torturing children.

55:37.100 --> 55:38.467
Fucking kids, Zac.

55:38.469 --> 55:39.668
Yeah, I get it.

55:39.670 --> 55:40.669
Young people.

55:40.671 --> 55:42.337
I... it's terrible.

55:46.175 --> 55:47.376
Are you okay?

55:47.644 --> 55:48.510
No.

55:53.483 --> 55:57.419
I wasn't going to tell you this,
but I've been seeing

55:57.421 --> 55:59.555
some pretty weird
stuff around here myself.

56:01.224 --> 56:02.558
What?

56:03.459 --> 56:05.327
Why didn't you tell me?

56:06.396 --> 56:08.530
I didn't think that
you'd believe me.

56:09.432 --> 56:12.568
As soon as Rita gets back we're
getting the hell out of here.

56:14.437 --> 56:16.838
There's something not
right about this place.

56:16.840 --> 56:19.708
Great. I'm going to go back out
and see if I can't find her.

56:21.778 --> 56:23.312
Be safe.

56:23.813 --> 56:25.113
I will.

56:26.215 --> 56:32.187
Here, um, take this just in
case that pervert comes back,

56:32.189 --> 56:33.255
or wherever.

56:33.257 --> 56:35.324
I want you to be safe.

56:35.792 --> 56:37.125
Thanks.

56:39.395 --> 56:41.330
Please come back in one piece?

56:41.698 --> 56:42.731
I will.

56:43.700 --> 56:45.567
Please extend me
the same courtesy.

56:45.569 --> 56:46.568
I'll be back.

57:43.426 --> 57:44.526
Jesus.

57:46.062 --> 57:47.362
Hey, Joel.

57:48.798 --> 57:50.065
Did they find Rita?

57:50.067 --> 57:51.500
I'm not looking for Rita.

57:51.502 --> 57:52.300
What?

57:52.302 --> 57:53.769
I'm looking for you.

57:58.241 --> 57:59.474
What the fuck?

57:59.476 --> 58:00.809
What the hell is your problem?

58:00.811 --> 58:03.111
You're my fucking problem.

58:04.213 --> 58:06.348
You stay the fuck away from her.

58:08.051 --> 58:09.551
I didn't touch her.

58:10.219 --> 58:12.054
She's the one that kissed me.

58:12.056 --> 58:13.722
You calling my girl a liar?

58:14.457 --> 58:15.524
No, Joel.

58:16.225 --> 58:17.359
I'm not.

58:19.262 --> 58:20.562
I'm calling her a slut.

58:21.664 --> 58:23.165
And a liar.

58:26.470 --> 58:28.136
You fucker.

58:28.471 --> 58:29.905
It's not worth it, man.

58:30.406 --> 58:31.540
Joel, stop.

58:50.426 --> 58:51.660
Joel, stop!

58:59.669 --> 59:02.537
Help! Help!

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:17.512
Rita?

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.116
Mr. Warren?

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:23.685
Come on, guys.

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:25.754
I fucking hate hiking.

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:27.522
Rita?

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.372
Rita?

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:46.508
Mr. Warren?

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.517
Oh, shit.

01:00:58.487 --> 01:00:59.554
What the fuck?

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:23.545
You guys?

01:01:26.415 --> 01:01:27.349
Hello?

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:31.319
Dale?

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.508
Anyone down here?

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:36.751
Someone there?

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:43.258
Hello?

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.808
You're in a lot of trouble.

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.610
I didn't do anything.

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:37.278
Yes, you did.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.447
Please don't put
me back in the box.

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.216
I didn't do it.

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:43.451
I tried to stop him,
but he doesn't listen.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:45.320
I couldn't make him stop.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:47.255
Just tell me what happened.

01:03:52.661 --> 01:03:53.561
Ned?

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:57.165
Ned?

01:03:58.701 --> 01:03:59.567
No.

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.339
No what?

01:04:04.673 --> 01:04:06.741
Ned's not here right now.

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:09.711
Then where is he?

01:04:10.446 --> 01:04:12.313
That's not important.

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:14.749
I see.

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:19.354
Then can you tell me
what happened to Sarah?

01:04:20.456 --> 01:04:22.123
I don't think so.

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:25.727
Can't or won't?

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:36.571
What the hell?

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:38.540
Hey, Maigen?

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:01.362
Who are you?

01:05:03.265 --> 01:05:04.365
Tell me.

01:05:05.267 --> 01:05:06.568
It's not important.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.136
Oh, I think it is.

01:05:09.271 --> 01:05:11.172
I don't care what you think.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.641
Then may I speak with Ned?

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.076
Is he still here?

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:17.545
You're speaking with me now.

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:28.323
Hello?

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.559
Anybody down here?

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:33.461
<i>Okay.</i>

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:37.165
So tell me what happened.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.701
You know what happened.

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:41.269
But do you?

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:43.338
Of course I do.

01:05:44.473 --> 01:05:47.075
So it was you.

01:05:47.077 --> 01:05:48.443
Who else could it be?

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:49.477
Ned?

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:51.146
Ned wouldn't hurt a fly.

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.515
He's too much of a sissy.

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:55.550
Is somebody down here?

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.124
Rita, is that you?

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.460
You took something from her.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:06.461
Uh huh.

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:07.495
What did you take?

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:09.898
You know what it was.

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:13.568
Why would you do that?

01:06:14.436 --> 01:06:16.571
Liars must be punished.

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:23.678
What do you do with it?

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.679
Rita?

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:25.647
<i>With what?</i>

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:26.648
Rita?

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.450
Her tongue.

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.648
Oh god. Up you go.

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:01.649
Come on.

01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:03.351
What the fuck?

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.553
Come on.

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:07.589
Come on.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.560
What the hell happened to her?

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:14.329
Come on.

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.704
Dude, she needs help.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.105
Yeah, no shit, Zac.

01:07:24.107 --> 01:07:25.740
She's going to fucking
bleed to death.

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:28.443
Well, um, I'll start a fire.

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:28.743
What?

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:31.746
You heat metal,
cauterize the wound.

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:33.248
We don't have
time for that shit.

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:35.216
Well, I'm not a
fucking doctor, Zac.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:35.716
Where's Dale?

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.686
I don't know. He's probably
still looking for Rita.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:39.887
Fuck.

01:07:40.422 --> 01:07:45.560
Um, speaking
of Rita, I found her.

01:07:46.428 --> 01:07:47.595
Where?

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.365
In the basement.

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:52.767
She's dead.

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:54.502
Dead?

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:55.803
Are you sure?

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.072
Are you sure?

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.307
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:01.242
Fuck, she's getting
blood all over the place.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:03.645
Just go and find Dale and
I'll stay here with her.

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:06.281
I don't know where Dale is. I...

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:08.049
Just fucking go find him! Go!

01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:08.883
Fine!

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:12.120
Come on.

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:20.662
What did you do with it?

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.462
<i>With what?</i>

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:24.265
Her tongue.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:26.234
<i>It's in the box.</i>

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:28.069
Nurses already looked in there.

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:29.671
Not that box.

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:31.572
My box.

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.640
Music box.

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:03.304
Shit.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:07.642
Where's Tedi?

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:09.042
How the hell should I know?

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:10.444
He just went out
looking for you.

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:11.511
What happened to her?

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:15.716
What?

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:17.685
We got to get her to a hospital.

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:18.786
I'm on it. I'm on it.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:19.654
Fuck.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:20.421
Give her to me.

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:21.522
Where's everyone else?

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:22.790
They went out looking for Rita.

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:24.392
Fuck.

01:09:24.626 --> 01:09:26.461
Dale, there's something
I got to tell you.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:27.795
If I don't leave right now,
she's going to fucking

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:28.629
bleed to death.

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:29.831
You find everyone else.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:30.832
You get to a signal.

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:32.533
And you fucking call me.

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:04.198
Ned?

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:09.437
Ned?

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:13.107
Twinkle, twinkle in their eyes

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:16.511
cut out tongues
that tell me lies.

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:18.546
Ned?

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:20.681
Why do you keep calling me that?

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.350
That's your name.

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.552
Everyone calls you Ned.

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.721
I hate that name.

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:30.324
You're the one Ned warned
me about, aren't you?

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:32.894
The one he tried to stop?

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:35.897
Ned can't stop me.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:39.767
But he does know
what you did to Sarah.

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:42.537
Everyone knows that.

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:45.239
And he's afraid of you.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.141
They're all afraid of me.

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:50.545
So why don't you
tell me who you are?

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:53.347
Or at least who
you think you are?

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.450
Why do you want to know?

01:10:55.452 --> 01:10:57.218
It's my job to
know what's going on

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.519
inside that head of yours.

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:00.555
I guess you could
call it curiosity.

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:04.525
Ask the cat what
curiosity can do.

01:12:19.434 --> 01:12:20.535
Hello?

01:12:20.836 --> 01:12:22.370
Anybody?

01:12:23.472 --> 01:12:24.572
Hey, Zac?

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.544
Zac?

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:31.345
Hey, Zac?

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:51.232
Tedi!

01:12:53.468 --> 01:12:54.335
You.

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.171
Where is she?

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.073
Who?

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:01.108
Don't play games with me, boy.

01:13:01.476 --> 01:13:02.743
She's got to be here.

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:06.447
Are you talking about Rita?

01:13:06.449 --> 01:13:07.748
Where is she?

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:10.551
She's here.

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:14.188
Is she okay?

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.323
No.

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:17.124
She's not.

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:18.359
Son of a bitch.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:20.528
I know who you are.

01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:23.331
I know what you do.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:26.534
You just stay back.

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:28.235
Stay back!

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:34.875
Tell me, grandpa, did she
scream when you fucked her?

01:13:36.244 --> 01:13:37.745
I never touched her.

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:40.314
Pretty little thing like that?

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.183
I'm sure you wanted to.

01:13:42.185 --> 01:13:43.551
Never touched her.

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:01.769
Is it because you loved her?

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:04.772
Or because she wasn't a boy?

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:06.874
How dare you.

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:10.344
Zac?

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:32.266
What do you think
about that, huh?

01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:34.468
How you like it,
you son of a bitch.

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:35.469
Huh?

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:36.904
See how you like it.

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:51.352
Are you okay?

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:58.192
I'm sure glad
I gave you that knife.

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.195
Can you stand?

01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:03.297
Yeah.

01:15:11.474 --> 01:15:13.441
- No, no. Don't look.
- Oh god.

01:15:13.443 --> 01:15:14.542
Don't look.

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:22.550
Tedi.

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:24.685
It's okay.

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:25.753
It's okay.

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:33.327
Let's get out of here.

01:15:47.275 --> 01:15:48.809
Oh shit.

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:49.877
What?

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:53.114
I don't have the keys.

01:15:53.648 --> 01:15:56.751
My wallet, clothes,
everything, it's inside.

01:15:59.654 --> 01:16:01.288
I'll go in. I'll be quick.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.323
Zac.

01:16:05.211 --> 01:16:05.660
Here.

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:06.359
Where the hell did you get that?

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:09.130
It doesn't matter. I just
want you to take it.

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:10.030
I need to know that you're safe.

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:10.831
No.

01:16:10.833 --> 01:16:12.767
A gun, Zac. Please, you take it.

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:15.102
Just get the keys
and get the fuck out.

01:16:15.104 --> 01:16:16.137
I'll be okay.

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:17.171
I'll be right back.

01:16:23.546 --> 01:16:25.546
Did you forget something?

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:27.148
Yeah.

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:27.882
I did.

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:38.325
Be careful.

01:16:38.827 --> 01:16:39.827
I will.

01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:41.162
I'll be right back.

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:22.136
Hello?

01:17:25.473 --> 01:17:26.874
Anybody home?

01:17:35.817 --> 01:17:36.817
Rita, wait.

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:38.085
Is he dead?

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:39.453
You don't understand.

01:17:39.455 --> 01:17:41.088
What don't I understand?

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:42.656
You don't understand what he is.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.758
I don't know my own grandfather?

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.694
What did you do to him?

01:17:46.696 --> 01:17:48.529
Pap pap, are you okay?

01:17:51.499 --> 01:17:52.766
Stay back!

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.906
Maigen, no.

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:01.108
Let go, Rita.

01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:10.784
Son of a bitch.

01:18:44.452 --> 01:18:47.354
You didn't really think you'd
get away with it, did you?

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:14.882
Tell me who you are.

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:17.751
You didn't say please.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.556
Perhaps you'd like to
think it over in the box?

01:19:28.763 --> 01:19:29.797
I'm waiting.

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:35.803
Zachary.

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:38.539
Zachary.

01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:42.343
<i>Come in.</i>

01:19:43.611 --> 01:19:46.146
Hi, I believe you
were looking for this.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:47.414
Yes.

01:19:47.416 --> 01:19:48.716
Set it on my desk.

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:55.322
Take the patient
back to his room.

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:57.558
Yes, sir.

01:19:58.426 --> 01:20:01.762
And see to it he doesn't
get in any more trouble.

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:03.564
Understand?

01:20:04.666 --> 01:20:05.899
You can count on me.

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.131
You don't have to do that.

01:20:37.665 --> 01:20:39.333
If you didn't want my help, Ned,

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:42.336
you shouldn't have asked for it.

01:20:43.438 --> 01:20:45.372
He's still alive, you know.

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:47.574
Not for long.

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:57.885
Such a naughty little boy.

01:21:01.823 --> 01:21:03.724
And you know what
happens to naughty

01:21:03.726 --> 01:21:05.759
little boys here, right?

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:08.328
Yeah.

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:11.532
I'll see you again real soon.

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:14.334
And you better not scream.

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:19.740
You don't want to get in
trouble again, do you?

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:39.326
Such a good boy.

01:21:53.174 --> 01:21:55.309
Stop being so difficult.

01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:06.353
Scream all you want.

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:08.889
Nobody will hear you.

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:12.292
No!

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:13.260
Oh god!

01:22:23.438 --> 01:22:24.571
Son of a bitch.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:46.460
Dale?

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:49.163
Zac, I'm at the hospital.

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.198
Yeah, lira's going to make it.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.466
She's getting a transfusion now.

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:53.800
But she lost a lot of blood.

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:56.069
But she got lucky.

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.671
Believe me, I, I know.

01:22:57.673 --> 01:22:59.506
They're at the hospital.

01:22:59.508 --> 01:23:01.308
Lira, she's going to make it.

01:23:01.776 --> 01:23:03.343
Is that Maigen with you?

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:05.179
Yeah, it is.

01:23:05.446 --> 01:23:07.181
Hey, Dale.

01:23:07.448 --> 01:23:08.782
Who else is with you?

01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:10.317
<i>It's just us.</i>

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:14.354
What do you mean?

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:18.192
I mean it's just us.

01:23:19.093 --> 01:23:20.827
There isn't anybody else.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.563
Please tell me you're joking.

01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:24.431
He's not joking, Dale.

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:25.832
We wouldn't even
have got out ourselves

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.534
if it wasn't for Maigen.

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:29.570
God.

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:32.339
Do you want us to
come to the hospital?

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:35.976
<i>Dale?</i>

01:23:35.978 --> 01:23:36.710
No.

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:38.512
Uh, get your butts home.

01:23:39.447 --> 01:23:40.681
I should check on lira.

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:42.149
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

01:23:42.817 --> 01:23:46.720
By any chance did lira
say who did this to her?

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:47.587
No.

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:49.256
She, uh, she said it was dark.

01:23:49.258 --> 01:23:50.791
She didn't really
remember anything,

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.560
it was the old man.

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:55.362
Mr. Warren.

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:58.465
<i>All right.</i>

01:23:58.467 --> 01:23:59.333
All right.

01:23:59.335 --> 01:24:01.768
Uh, just let me
take care of things.

01:24:01.770 --> 01:24:02.368
You get some rest.

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:05.105
I'll call the police and get
this whole thing squared away.

01:24:05.107 --> 01:24:06.106
Okay, Dale.

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:07.708
You take care.

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:09.343
You too, Zac.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:45.746
You brought that
awful thing with you?

01:24:48.816 --> 01:24:50.384
Yeah, I did.

01:24:50.818 --> 01:24:52.219
Why?

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:53.687
I don't know.

01:24:53.689 --> 01:24:55.589
Used to have one as a kid.

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:59.159
I guess you can call it
me being sentimental.

01:25:00.461 --> 01:25:02.162
Oh my god.

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:05.365
Oh my god.

01:25:06.467 --> 01:25:07.234
What?

01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:08.201
Zac.

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:09.770
What?

01:25:10.471 --> 01:25:11.838
Rita's still out there.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.740
We can't just leave her there.

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:21.548
Maigen, um, Tedi found Rita.

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:26.153
Well, where is she then?

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:31.158
Where is she?

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:41.234
Dale!

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:44.538
Is anybody here?

01:25:45.506 --> 01:25:46.873
Shh.

01:25:50.712 --> 01:25:55.749
I guess you can say that
she's in a better place.

01:26:31.652 --> 01:26:33.286
I don't know what
I would've done

01:26:33.288 --> 01:26:34.755
if you hadn't been there today.

01:31:10.564 --> 01:31:13.366
Don't stick your
tongue out at me.
