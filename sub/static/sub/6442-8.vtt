Let's have a look.

00:38.064 --> 00:39.395
You're a new man.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.600
Like looking at a stranger.

00:43.369 --> 00:45.599
Wasn't that the idea?

00:48.441 --> 00:50.068
Throat hurts.

00:50.443 --> 00:53.970
You'll feel better when the swelling
in your vocal cords goes down.

00:58.451 --> 01:02.444
Personally, I think society
places too much emphasis on looks.

01:02.622 --> 01:05.318
It should be the character
of a man that counts.

01:05.825 --> 01:07.588
Don't you agree...

01:07.860 --> 01:09.350
...Mr. Edge?

01:10.696 --> 01:14.154
I think you have me
confused with someone else.

01:14.333 --> 01:19.168
You can change your face,
your hair, your voice...

01:19.338 --> 01:22.068
...but not your DNA.
You still sweat the same.

01:28.180 --> 01:30.239
I don't walk out of here
in five minutes...

01:30.416 --> 01:32.884
...my people have orders
to send the police...

01:33.786 --> 01:38.553
...and inform my father that you
didn't die on the docks that day.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.389
Maybe he'll send somebody
to finish the job.

01:49.969 --> 01:51.493
What do you want?

01:52.171 --> 01:54.799
When you and my father
were teenagers...

01:54.974 --> 01:58.000
...you conspired to kill my grandparents...

02:00.046 --> 02:02.674
...and split the insurance money.

02:03.516 --> 02:05.677
You on something, Lex?

02:05.851 --> 02:09.184
-Because, frankly, you sound delusional.
-No, I've got evidence...

02:09.354 --> 02:11.653
...but I need hard proof
to bring down my father.

02:14.894 --> 02:18.694
You tell the whole story,
he goes to prison.

02:19.432 --> 02:22.128
And maybe you can get a new life
to go along with the face.

02:27.974 --> 02:29.441
I blow the building.

02:29.609 --> 02:34.171
Lionel gets rid of his bastard father
and his gin-soaked mother.

02:34.347 --> 02:37.783
The slum lord splits
the insurance payment with us.

02:38.317 --> 02:41.480
Lionel uses his cut for his first start-up.

02:41.654 --> 02:43.588
And the rest is history.

02:46.359 --> 02:49.260
Sorry for the interruption, sir,
but your father called again.

02:49.428 --> 02:51.692
I did what you asked.
I told him you weren't here.

02:51.864 --> 02:53.889
You look worried, Darius.

02:54.066 --> 02:55.533
Relax.

03:46.052 --> 03:47.383
Darius!

05:29.822 --> 05:31.312
Lex?

05:32.491 --> 05:34.049
Are you alone?

05:34.226 --> 05:36.126
Yeah. What happened to you?

05:38.531 --> 05:40.522
Somebody tried to kill me last night.

05:41.534 --> 05:43.559
Let's get you to a hospital,
call the police.

05:43.736 --> 05:45.431
No hospitals, no police.

05:45.905 --> 05:47.998
These people are professionals.

05:48.808 --> 05:51.208
They killed my security guard, Darius.

05:51.844 --> 05:53.573
They tried to finish me off too.

05:54.914 --> 05:57.109
I just need time to think.

05:59.752 --> 06:02.619
-Who would want to kill you?
-The less you know, the better.

06:02.788 --> 06:06.087
Lex, I can't help you if you
don't tell me what's going on.

06:08.661 --> 06:10.822
It was probably my father.

06:11.697 --> 06:15.497
You guys have had your problems,
but you really think he'd try to kill you?

06:15.668 --> 06:18.796
-lt was either him or Morgan Edge.
-Morgan Edge.

06:21.473 --> 06:24.874
Isn't he the crime boss I read was killed
in a shootout a few months ago?

06:25.444 --> 06:27.639
He survived, went underground.

06:27.813 --> 06:31.271
Got some hack plastic surgeon
to change his appearance.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.150
What does he have against you?

06:35.421 --> 06:37.412
I have evidence
linking him and my father...

06:37.590 --> 06:40.024
...to a crime that can
get them the death penalty.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.127
That evidence was supposed to be
delivered to the U.S. Attorney.

06:43.295 --> 06:45.229
Clark, is that you?

06:45.397 --> 06:49.265
But it's in my safe, Clark,
and I can't go back there.

06:51.170 --> 06:52.603
Clark?

06:54.473 --> 06:56.202
I thought I heard somebody up here.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.833
Since you're up with the cows, why
don't you give me a hand with milking?

07:00.012 --> 07:02.981
Sorry, Dad, I got some
last-minute cramming to do.

07:03.148 --> 07:04.581
All right.

07:04.984 --> 07:07.316
But I expect you to get an A.

07:08.287 --> 07:09.686
Yes, sir.

07:17.696 --> 07:19.789
All right, I'll go get what's in your safe.

07:19.965 --> 07:21.455
No. It's too dangerous, Clark.

07:21.634 --> 07:25.092
-My people could be in on this.
-lf anyone asks, I'll just play dumb...

07:25.271 --> 07:27.501
...tell them I was there to meet you.

07:27.673 --> 07:30.005
Tell me exactly what happened.

08:28.867 --> 08:30.232
Mr. Kent.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.070
Can I help you?

08:33.238 --> 08:35.172
I'm here to see Lex.

08:35.341 --> 08:37.366
Most of the household is still asleep.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.902
Is Darius on duty?

08:41.212 --> 08:42.804
He had the night off.

08:43.015 --> 08:45.040
You got stuck with the graveyard shift.

08:50.055 --> 08:51.488
What a bummer.

08:54.526 --> 08:56.084
Anything unusual happen?

08:57.429 --> 08:58.919
Not until you arrived.

09:00.299 --> 09:02.927
Right. Well, I know
how to take a hint, so....

09:11.010 --> 09:13.069
Tell Darius I was asking for him.

09:23.122 --> 09:25.886
I'm telling you, Lex, it's like
being in The Twilight Zone.

09:26.058 --> 09:27.389
There was nothing wrong.

09:27.559 --> 09:30.221
I didn't imagine getting shot at, Clark.

09:30.396 --> 09:32.830
They must've had cleaners
to cover their tracks.

09:33.132 --> 09:36.499
Yeah, well, they missed a spot.
I found this in the hallway.

09:37.936 --> 09:40.700
I called Darius' house to see
if anyone knew he was missing.

09:40.873 --> 09:45.333
But according to his answering machine, his
wife and kids are visiting their grandparents.

09:45.978 --> 09:49.038
Darius is probably at the bottom
of Crater Lake by now.

09:51.617 --> 09:53.642
Maybe we should call the U.S. Attorney.

09:54.753 --> 09:56.186
Tell him what?

09:57.222 --> 09:58.484
He was nervous about...

09:58.657 --> 10:01.683
...going after someone as powerful
as Lionel Luthor to begin with.

10:01.860 --> 10:05.318
I don't think he'll be issuing
warrants based on a shard of glass.

10:05.597 --> 10:08.623
Is there anyone who can
corroborate any part of your story?

10:11.036 --> 10:12.970
Well, is Lex all right?

10:13.939 --> 10:15.566
He's freaked out.

10:15.741 --> 10:18.107
Pretty shaken up, but he's alive.

10:18.277 --> 10:20.438
How'd you get mixed up in this?

10:20.612 --> 10:24.548
I was-- I was just researching
Lionel Luthor for a story.

10:24.716 --> 10:28.379
I found out that he ran
with a pretty tough crowd as a kid.

10:28.887 --> 10:30.184
Morgan Edge?

10:30.556 --> 10:33.719
Yeah, I thought Lex would be
interested, but I had no idea...

10:33.892 --> 10:38.124
...he'd develop this theory that Edge
and Lionel murdered his grandparents.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.292
Chloe, these people are dangerous.

10:40.466 --> 10:41.831
They could come after you too.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.366
Lex and I both agree
you should stay out of sight.

10:44.536 --> 10:46.970
No. Nobody who knows
anything about this is safe.

10:47.139 --> 10:49.573
Not until whoever's
responsible is exposed.

10:49.741 --> 10:52.801
I'm not gonna leave you alone.
Grab your laptop, and let's go.

11:16.101 --> 11:17.398
Hello, Clark.

11:18.570 --> 11:21.937
-Miss Sullivan, isn't it?
-Yeah.

11:23.842 --> 11:27.039
Clark, Mr. Luthor has something
he'd like to talk to you about.

11:27.212 --> 11:29.009
I'm afraid it's serious.

11:30.015 --> 11:32.540
Have you seen Lex, Clark?

11:35.354 --> 11:37.948
-Not for a few days.
-Lex is missing.

11:38.123 --> 11:39.681
It's important that I find him.

11:40.392 --> 11:42.485
Mr. Luthor, I know Lex pretty well.

11:42.661 --> 11:46.097
If he wanted you to know
where he was, you probably would.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.696
Lex is seriously ill.

11:51.870 --> 11:53.303
He needs help.

11:53.472 --> 11:54.700
What do you mean, ill?

11:56.642 --> 11:59.941
There's a psychotic break.
Lex has had a psychotic break.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.712
That can't be right.

12:04.249 --> 12:07.377
It happened while he was on that island.

12:07.553 --> 12:09.748
I thought he'd beaten it...

12:09.922 --> 12:15.053
...but he's had a relapse.
He's suffering from paranoid delusions.

12:15.561 --> 12:18.496
He's hearing voices.
He sees things that aren't there.

12:23.569 --> 12:25.901
I want my son.
I want him back...

12:26.071 --> 12:27.732
...the way he used to be.

12:28.540 --> 12:32.306
If you hear from him, Clark,
you have to help me.

12:32.477 --> 12:35.139
We have to get him the care he needs.

13:10.182 --> 13:11.979
Lex, what are you doing down here?

13:13.819 --> 13:15.912
I had to get the baby.
He was crying.

13:16.989 --> 13:18.786
My father woke him.

13:19.691 --> 13:21.124
The baby?

13:22.594 --> 13:24.186
What baby?

13:34.306 --> 13:36.331
My little brother Julian.

13:45.017 --> 13:46.848
Lex--

13:48.320 --> 13:50.151
He's asleep.

14:10.909 --> 14:13.469
And the baby was a figment
of Lex's imagination?

14:13.645 --> 14:15.772
He did have a little brother
named Julian.

14:15.947 --> 14:18.279
He died as an infant
when Lex was still a kid.

14:18.450 --> 14:20.384
That must've been traumatic for him.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.654
Anyway, Chloe's with him now...

14:23.822 --> 14:25.790
...and he seems perfectly fine.

14:26.692 --> 14:29.661
I don't get it. One second,
he's thinking he's holding a baby...

14:29.828 --> 14:31.921
...and the next, he's
making complete sense.

14:32.097 --> 14:35.555
I don't understand how you could
hide him in our barn without telling us.

14:35.734 --> 14:39.295
Dad, he was scared. And he thinks
Lionel's trying to kill him.

14:40.405 --> 14:43.431
-He said Morgan Edge is still alive.
-Morgan Edge.

14:43.942 --> 14:45.466
He's involved.

14:45.811 --> 14:49.872
Morgan Edge knows about your abilities.
He knows that kryptonite can kill you.

14:50.048 --> 14:51.879
How could you not tell us that?

14:53.285 --> 14:55.116
-There's more.
-More?

14:55.420 --> 14:59.015
He said Morgan Edge
has had plastic surgery.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.785
Even if he showed up,
we wouldn't know it was him.

15:02.861 --> 15:06.228
So Morgan Edge is alive,
and he's had plastic surgery.

15:06.865 --> 15:11.802
Clark, don't you think that that sounds like
another one of Lex's delusions? Come on.

15:12.838 --> 15:15.636
I know how hard it is for you
to see Lex in this condition...

15:15.807 --> 15:18.503
...but he needs psychiatric care.

15:27.085 --> 15:29.485
You think you know people...

15:30.188 --> 15:32.179
...and you realize it's all just a facade.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.957
Lex, you know we only want
what's best for you.

15:35.460 --> 15:39.260
Save the cloying maternal posturing
for your own son, Mrs. Kent.

15:39.431 --> 15:41.126
I heard you all talking.

15:44.669 --> 15:46.261
Little Kent cabal...

15:47.839 --> 15:50.740
...such a selective group, aren't you?
And so secretive.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.275
Plotting to pack me off to the loony bin.

15:56.882 --> 15:58.713
I tried to stop him.

15:58.884 --> 16:00.146
I'm sorry.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.831
You're all watching me now?

16:16.802 --> 16:18.793
Lex, where are you going?

16:18.970 --> 16:21.063
To find Morgan Edge
and prove I'm not crazy.

16:21.239 --> 16:24.470
You're either with me or against me,
Clark. Choose right now.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.374
Clark.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.061
-Maybe you should wait in the car.
-No.

16:48.233 --> 16:50.565
Lex, I've got your back.
That's why I'm here.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.847
Lex, maybe this is the wrong place.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.816
No. No, this was the place.

17:43.221 --> 17:44.813
No, Edge was here.

17:45.323 --> 17:48.815
That was only yesterday. And these
people look like they've been here a while.

17:48.994 --> 17:52.395
Don't you see?
It's part of the cover-up, Clark.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.328
It wouldn't be that hard.

17:54.799 --> 17:57.859
Bring in a few machines,
some immigrant labor.

17:59.337 --> 18:01.601
If you want to vanish,
why go through the trouble?

18:01.773 --> 18:03.172
I don't know, Clark.

18:06.611 --> 18:08.374
Lex....

18:08.747 --> 18:10.180
You gotta ask yourself...

18:11.216 --> 18:14.208
...is there any possibility
you might be imagining all this?

18:18.723 --> 18:20.054
Where's Morgan Edge?

18:20.225 --> 18:21.692
Where's Edge?

18:21.860 --> 18:24.852
Tell me where he is, or I'll stitch
this seam through your hand!

18:25.030 --> 18:27.794
Lex, he doesn't understand
a word you're saying.

18:30.068 --> 18:33.367
-Come on, let's go.
-All right, Clark, you win.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.935
But I'm not imagining this, am l? Huh?

18:39.144 --> 18:41.738
-Let's go.
-Huh? Am I imagining this?

18:42.314 --> 18:44.145
Go! Go!

18:44.482 --> 18:45.779
Come on.

18:54.826 --> 18:56.885
There's gotta be more evidence.

18:57.062 --> 19:00.589
Maybe we should call the sheriff,
get her to bring in a forensics team.

19:02.300 --> 19:03.597
What do you want to do, Lex?

19:07.305 --> 19:08.738
Mr. Luthor.

19:11.142 --> 19:12.734
Darius.

19:17.215 --> 19:20.184
-You're alive.
-We were worried about you, sir.

19:25.890 --> 19:27.357
You're in on this, aren't you?

19:27.525 --> 19:29.220
In on what, sir?

19:31.196 --> 19:32.595
Lex.

19:37.502 --> 19:39.231
-Come on, Lex.
-Lex.

19:40.972 --> 19:43.065
Thank God. We were looking
everywhere for you.

19:43.241 --> 19:44.799
Did you call her?

19:45.477 --> 19:48.674
-I don't even know who she is.
-She's my psychiatrist.

19:49.848 --> 19:53.579
Don't you think it's a little convenient
she just happens to be here?

19:53.752 --> 19:55.947
Security called me, Lex.

19:56.121 --> 19:57.452
You need to come with me.

19:57.622 --> 20:00.250
No. No, I'm not going anywhere.

20:00.425 --> 20:03.360
Somebody tried to kill me last night.
I jumped through a window!

20:03.528 --> 20:05.723
Look, I have proof.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.067
The window was broken.

20:11.436 --> 20:13.370
You got angry during our last session...

20:13.538 --> 20:16.098
...and threw this vase
through the hall window.

20:23.114 --> 20:24.638
I'm gonna give you something.

20:26.885 --> 20:29.115
What is this? Huh?

20:29.454 --> 20:31.513
Some kind of hallucinogen?

20:31.690 --> 20:33.555
It's a sedative.

20:34.826 --> 20:35.884
No.

20:36.061 --> 20:38.086
No, you're working for my father.

20:38.263 --> 20:42.131
-Drugging me to make me crazy.
-We need to get you to a hospital.

20:43.935 --> 20:46.631
All right, Mr. Luthor,
everything's gonna be fine.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.832
It's gonna be all right.

20:51.042 --> 20:54.375
Wait. Get on the ground!
Both of you, on the ground!

20:54.546 --> 20:55.843
-Get on the ground!
-Lex.

20:57.215 --> 21:00.412
-Lex, give me the gun.
-No, Clark.

21:00.685 --> 21:04.451
If they take me to the hospital, I'll wind
up dead or drooling in a padded cell.

21:04.622 --> 21:08.114
-Why would they want to do that?
-It's a perfect plan, Clark.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.694
If the world thinks I'm crazy...

21:10.862 --> 21:14.423
...no one will believe what I found out
about my father and Morgan Edge!

21:16.234 --> 21:20.762
-Think about it, Clark.
-Young man, your friend is very sick.

21:20.939 --> 21:24.773
These conspiracy theories
are a symptom of his condition.

21:24.943 --> 21:26.467
Shut up!

21:29.314 --> 21:31.043
Maybe I am crazy, Clark.

21:33.618 --> 21:35.779
I honestly don't know anymore.

21:37.856 --> 21:39.949
But what if I'm right about all this?

21:41.559 --> 21:44.187
Are you really just gonna
let them put me away?

22:01.813 --> 22:03.280
Hello?

22:04.382 --> 22:05.781
Are you here?

22:07.452 --> 22:09.579
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

22:10.155 --> 22:12.988
I got your message.
I brought the food.

22:13.158 --> 22:15.956
Now tell me what I'm doing
here in the middle of the night.

22:26.004 --> 22:27.266
Lex.

22:29.841 --> 22:31.331
What's wrong?

22:31.509 --> 22:34.672
There's a possibility he's being drugged.
People are after him.

22:34.846 --> 22:38.282
I couldn't bring him to the farm,
and I knew you knew this place.

22:41.152 --> 22:42.881
Why didn't you tell me about this?

22:43.054 --> 22:45.887
Because if Lex is right,
everyone who's involved is in danger.

22:46.057 --> 22:49.493
And I promised myself I would never
put you in that position again.

22:50.428 --> 22:52.555
What exactly are we mixed up in?

22:52.730 --> 22:53.992
I wish I knew.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.931
I need you to stay with him.

23:00.405 --> 23:01.667
Where are you going?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.968
I gotta get some evidence to Chloe
that may prove that he's being drugged.

23:05.143 --> 23:08.112
She couldn't come here because
we think she's being watched.

23:08.479 --> 23:10.276
Don't worry, Lana.

23:11.683 --> 23:13.412
I'll tell you everything.

23:14.552 --> 23:15.985
Be careful.

23:16.454 --> 23:18.217
He's not himself.

23:18.389 --> 23:19.651
Go.

23:36.107 --> 23:37.369
Hey.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.033
-Thanks for meeting me out here.
-Of course.

23:40.211 --> 23:42.577
Find out if this can
make someone hallucinate.

23:42.747 --> 23:44.977
I'll get it to my source
at the pharmacology lab.

23:45.149 --> 23:48.277
I need to check out a Dr. Claire Foster
and the two security guards.

23:48.453 --> 23:54.016
-lf there's a conspiracy, they're likely in on it.
-I dug up some of Lex's medical records.

23:55.059 --> 23:58.460
Apparently, this isn't the first time
he's had this kind of problem.

23:58.630 --> 24:01.565
-What are you talking about?
-Well, after his brother died...

24:01.733 --> 24:03.667
...Lex went right back
to boarding school.

24:03.835 --> 24:09.967
And soon after that, he started exhibiting
some pretty bizarro behavior.

24:10.141 --> 24:11.938
What do you mean, "bizarro"?

24:12.110 --> 24:15.876
His housemaster found him sitting in
the bell tower in the middle of the night...

24:16.047 --> 24:18.607
...singing a lullaby
to a wrapped-up blanket.

24:21.452 --> 24:24.012
You know, I want to believe
that this is a conspiracy...

24:24.188 --> 24:26.952
...just as much as you do,
believe me...

24:27.125 --> 24:29.593
...but I think we need
to start preparing ourselves...

24:29.761 --> 24:32.628
...for the possibility
that Lex really is losing his mind.

24:40.204 --> 24:42.263
Thank you for coming, Lana.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.578
I'm just glad you're letting me help.

25:00.058 --> 25:01.548
What is this?

25:02.360 --> 25:05.693
It's chamomile. It'll help you relax.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.699
Liar.

25:11.202 --> 25:12.601
What?

25:12.770 --> 25:14.032
Liar!

25:14.572 --> 25:17.166
-Lex, what's wrong?
-You're trying to drug me!

25:17.342 --> 25:20.243
-I would never do that.
-I shouldn't have trusted you.

25:20.678 --> 25:23.112
-Lex, wait.
-Keep away from me!

25:45.370 --> 25:46.632
Lana?

26:13.364 --> 26:15.127
What's the trouble, mister?

26:48.833 --> 26:54.601
You know, I was never quite sure which of
them was more out of touch with reality...

26:54.772 --> 26:58.299
...Don Quixote, jousting
with imaginary enemies...

26:58.476 --> 27:02.037
...or his loyal lackey Sancho Panza...

27:02.213 --> 27:07.515
...indulging his master's fantasies
in spite of the danger to everyone else.

27:07.685 --> 27:09.915
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

27:10.455 --> 27:12.446
I'm going to find Lex.

27:13.591 --> 27:15.582
If I were you, I'd be careful.

27:16.394 --> 27:20.387
Lex is convinced you're responsible for
everything that's been happening to him.

27:20.565 --> 27:25.059
Well, I'm touched by your concern, but you
and I both know which of us is to blame.

27:25.236 --> 27:27.363
-Mr. Luthor, I don't think--
-No, no!

27:28.606 --> 27:29.868
I don't want to hear it.

27:30.041 --> 27:33.568
If you had listened to me, Lex would
already be getting the help he needs...

27:33.744 --> 27:36.713
...and Miss Lang wouldn't be here
fighting for her life.

27:37.381 --> 27:38.871
Clark?

27:39.517 --> 27:41.178
Are you okay?

27:42.286 --> 27:43.583
But don't worry about me.

27:43.754 --> 27:47.884
My security personnel
are well-equipped to protect me...

27:48.059 --> 27:50.721
...and to find my son.

27:51.529 --> 27:53.963
Now, I strongly suggest
the two of you go home...

27:54.132 --> 27:56.692
...before you do any more damage.

27:58.936 --> 28:00.198
Miss Sullivan.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.532
The drug analysis came back.

28:05.209 --> 28:07.541
It was just a common sedative.

28:19.257 --> 28:21.521
Lionel's right, Chloe.

28:21.692 --> 28:24.422
-I really screwed up.
-Maybe not.

28:24.595 --> 28:27.530
There are a lot of drugs that could
make Lex see pink elephants.

28:27.698 --> 28:30.758
Now, the question is,
how did it get into his system?

28:32.236 --> 28:35.763
The mansion. Everything's brought
to him there. The food, the drinks.

28:35.940 --> 28:39.239
So for all we know, they
could've been dosing him for weeks.

28:42.446 --> 28:44.175
How'd you do it?

28:45.883 --> 28:48.681
-Do what?
-Get the drugs into Lex's system.

28:48.853 --> 28:52.687
I don't appreciate some farm boy coming
in here and accusing me of a felony.

28:54.559 --> 28:56.527
Don't underestimate farm boys.

28:56.694 --> 29:00.630
-Baling hay can make you pretty strong.
-Come on, you're gonna break my arm!

29:00.798 --> 29:02.993
Not if you tell me
how you drugged Lex.

29:04.735 --> 29:06.066
It was the Scotch.

29:10.508 --> 29:13.807
-Tell me who you're working for!
-I don't know who they are, all right?

29:13.978 --> 29:16.242
-All I have is a cell phone number.
-Then call it.

29:16.414 --> 29:18.814
Tell them to be at the
Smallville Stables by noon...

29:18.983 --> 29:21.383
...with a bag full of Benjamins
or I go to the cops.

29:21.552 --> 29:24.646
Kid, you're crazy. These people
are not gonna pay you off.

29:24.822 --> 29:26.119
They're gonna kill you.

29:27.291 --> 29:28.952
I'll take my chances.

29:34.165 --> 29:35.689
Thank you, Mike.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.838
Lex. How'd you get in here, Lex?

29:46.010 --> 29:51.642
When people think you're insane and
you're holding a rifle to their head...

29:51.816 --> 29:53.283
...they tend to do what you ask.

29:53.451 --> 29:57.080
Put the guns down, all right?
Sit down. Let's talk.

29:57.622 --> 29:59.681
Sure, Dad.

29:59.857 --> 30:02.189
We'll have a nice father-son chat.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.588
All right, sit down.

30:03.761 --> 30:07.094
About how you and Morgan Edge
killed my grandparents...

30:07.265 --> 30:11.599
...and how you're drugging me
to make the world think I'm crazy.

30:11.769 --> 30:14.966
Hey, why not do the whole thing
on Oprah, you know?

30:15.139 --> 30:18.404
Spill our dysfunctional guts
on national TV like regular families do.

30:18.576 --> 30:20.601
All right, I understand why you're angry.

30:20.778 --> 30:24.737
I found out the same thing. The slum
lord that owned my parents' tenement...

30:24.915 --> 30:28.078
...hired Edge to blow it up
for the insurance money.

30:28.252 --> 30:33.121
-Just like you planned it.
-No. Lex, no. Lex, no, they were parents.

30:33.357 --> 30:36.690
No matter how badly they treated me,
I would never hurt them.

30:36.861 --> 30:41.355
And I know deep down
you don't want to hurt me.

30:44.835 --> 30:48.396
-You know what disappoints me, Dad?
-All right, tell me.

30:48.839 --> 30:51.205
You hired pros to kill me.

30:51.375 --> 30:54.833
You always taught me, if you want
something done right, do it yourself.

30:55.012 --> 30:58.607
Lex, the person responsible
for this is Morgan Edge.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.674
I know where he is.

31:01.919 --> 31:04.649
Believe me, we can get justice. Lex.

31:05.122 --> 31:07.716
Lex! Listen to me.

31:07.892 --> 31:09.257
You'll wake the baby.

31:11.429 --> 31:13.021
It's-- It's Julian.

31:13.931 --> 31:18.027
-Are you seeing Julian again?
-You know I can't take it when he cries, Dad.

31:18.202 --> 31:19.931
Julian isn't here, Lex.
He's dead.

31:20.104 --> 31:21.833
-No!
-No, Lex.

31:22.006 --> 31:24.167
You can't blame yourself
for the baby's death.

31:24.342 --> 31:27.004
-Shut up!
-I know you didn't mean to hurt him. I know.

31:27.178 --> 31:29.646
-Shut up!
-Lex, it was an accident, Lex.

31:29.814 --> 31:33.079
-Tell me where Morgan Edge is now!
-All right. All right.

31:37.655 --> 31:40.783
You have to be careful.
Lex, please.

31:41.392 --> 31:43.986
Be careful. Please, Lex.

31:48.999 --> 31:51.433
I can't bear to lose another child.

32:06.384 --> 32:07.851
Hello?

32:20.798 --> 32:24.029
Tell me where to find the guy
you're working for or I keep squeezing.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.064
Check it out.

33:08.546 --> 33:09.945
Jameson?

33:27.765 --> 33:31.257
I gave you a chance, Edge,
but you really screwed it up.

33:31.635 --> 33:34.968
-Now drop the gun.
-Your father's the one who screwed up.

33:35.639 --> 33:39.040
If we'd done it my way,
you'd be dead by now.

33:39.210 --> 33:40.507
What are you talking about?

33:40.678 --> 33:43.203
You think you could've escaped
if I wanted to kill you?

33:43.380 --> 33:46.440
It was your father's idea
to make you look crazy instead.

33:46.617 --> 33:47.879
You're lying!

33:48.352 --> 33:50.343
It's true, Lex.

33:50.521 --> 33:53.251
Lionel's gone soft in his old age.

33:53.591 --> 33:57.755
He was willing to lose his parents,
but he couldn't bear to lose another child.

33:58.229 --> 34:00.254
Neck still bothering you?

34:00.431 --> 34:02.490
Muscle aches, sleeplessness?

34:02.666 --> 34:05.134
All common side effects of the drugs.

34:05.903 --> 34:07.871
I knew I wasn't crazy.

34:08.672 --> 34:09.969
Tell me how you did it.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.568
Lionel thought of everything.

34:13.310 --> 34:19.215
First the dope, then getting the window
fixed, then setting up the sweatshop.

34:19.382 --> 34:23.149
All little details
to push you over the edge.

34:23.687 --> 34:25.313
How do I know it wasn't all you?

34:25.556 --> 34:27.922
Well, take a look around you.

34:28.092 --> 34:32.051
You think I'd be in digs like this
if I hadn't cut a deal with your old man?

34:32.963 --> 34:37.297
You gotta admit, it was an elegant plan.
Just like when he was a kid.

34:37.868 --> 34:42.202
Either you crack so completely
that you can't form a coherent sentence...

34:42.373 --> 34:47.139
...or anything you say
sounds like the ravings of a madman.

34:49.847 --> 34:52.839
But he doesn't have to win, Lex.

34:54.318 --> 34:56.650
We can bring him down.

34:56.820 --> 34:58.481
Together.

35:02.860 --> 35:04.555
Maybe I'll just kill both of you.

35:10.968 --> 35:12.458
Hi, Kal.

35:13.103 --> 35:15.901
I had a feeling
we'd see each other again.

35:16.073 --> 35:19.133
That's why I've been
carrying these around.

35:21.211 --> 35:24.578
-You know each other?
-We go way back.

35:26.216 --> 35:27.843
You're in on this too, Clark?

35:28.018 --> 35:30.077
-You're in on this too?
-No, Lex...

35:30.254 --> 35:32.518
...it's not what you think.

35:57.481 --> 35:59.142
Thank you.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.613
Don't thank me, Clark.

36:06.924 --> 36:08.721
You're part of this.

36:09.393 --> 36:11.054
I have to kill you too.

36:21.905 --> 36:25.238
You think you can just slither
away from me, Clark?

36:26.010 --> 36:28.501
Lex, I'm your friend.

36:28.946 --> 36:31.210
I would never do anything to hurt you.

36:31.382 --> 36:34.010
What'd you do?
Did you betray Edge too?

36:34.885 --> 36:37.718
Is that why he beat you to a pulp?
Tell me, Clark!

36:37.888 --> 36:40.755
What's the price
of a Judas kiss these days?

37:33.010 --> 37:35.672
I was right about you all along, Clark.

37:38.282 --> 37:40.147
You're not even human.

37:56.533 --> 37:58.763
That car hit him at 80 miles an hour.

37:59.937 --> 38:02.701
And he tossed it like a toy.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.238
Did you see him?

38:05.843 --> 38:07.140
See who?

38:11.081 --> 38:12.378
No, no, no.

38:12.549 --> 38:14.073
He was right there.

38:21.058 --> 38:22.958
He was right there, I swear!

38:23.761 --> 38:25.422
It's all right, Lex.

38:25.963 --> 38:27.760
We're gonna get you
the help you need.

38:31.969 --> 38:33.800
No. No.

38:34.271 --> 38:36.398
He was right there.
Look at the car!

38:36.573 --> 38:39.167
Look at it! Look!

38:39.710 --> 38:41.405
He was right there.

38:43.413 --> 38:44.880
Clark!

38:55.993 --> 38:57.460
Hey.

39:00.998 --> 39:02.863
How's Lex?

39:04.067 --> 39:05.625
Lex isn't doing so good.

39:07.171 --> 39:08.695
I'm sorry.

39:09.573 --> 39:12.337
I know how much
you wanted to help him.

39:13.477 --> 39:15.707
The doctors say that you're doing better.

39:19.049 --> 39:21.108
I almost died, Clark.

39:23.687 --> 39:24.949
I know.

39:30.494 --> 39:33.429
I always thought
you were being paranoid.

39:34.932 --> 39:36.365
About what?

39:36.800 --> 39:39.769
That being around you is too dangerous.

39:41.905 --> 39:43.395
But it's true.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.131
-Lana--
-It's okay, Clark.

39:47.244 --> 39:48.575
I know.

39:49.479 --> 39:51.606
You were only looking out for me.

39:53.250 --> 39:54.683
But you're right...

39:55.252 --> 39:58.050
...I think I have to stay away from you.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.647
Dr. Foster.

40:36.059 --> 40:38.425
Good evening, Mr. Luthor.

40:39.763 --> 40:42.323
Why do these institutions always...

40:42.499 --> 40:44.729
...stink of ammonia?

40:49.439 --> 40:50.906
How's Lex?

40:51.074 --> 40:54.566
Now that he's here, I can
control his meds much more tightly.

40:54.745 --> 40:59.011
By the time he finishes his treatment,
he won't have any short-term memory left.

41:00.284 --> 41:02.514
Wasn't that exactly what you wanted?

41:03.387 --> 41:07.881
Never believe for a second,
doctor, that this is what I wanted.

41:08.492 --> 41:11.017
I love my son more than life itself.

41:12.396 --> 41:14.364
But he leaves me no choice.

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
