YOU KNOW WHAT? MOVIE STARTS
IN, LIKE, 15 MINUTES.

00:37.886 --> 00:39.354
YOU WANNA PICK UP
THE PACE, ARTHUR?

00:40.356 --> 00:42.691
EXCUSE ME FOR CHEWING.

00:42.758 --> 00:43.658
IT'S MASHED POTATOES.

00:43.809 --> 00:46.511
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHEW
EVERY BITE 48 TIMES.

00:46.579 --> 00:49.698
NOT ALL OF US HAVE
A WORKING STOMACH.

00:49.765 --> 00:52.834
I DIGEST MOST OF MY FOOD
IN MY MOUTH.

00:53.936 --> 00:57.672
WHERE DO YOU DIGEST
THE REST, ON YOUR SHIRT?

00:57.740 --> 00:58.590
OH, HEY, DANNY.

00:58.657 --> 00:59.991
HEY, MAN.

OH, BEAUTIFUL.

01:03.963 --> 01:06.514

WITH 19 SECONDS TO GO.

01:06.582 --> 01:07.882
YOU GOT SOME, UH-

01:07.950 --> 01:09.100

THANKS, MAN.

01:18.928 --> 01:20.545
THANK YOU. HEY,

01:20.613 --> 01:22.013
WANNA BUY ME

01:22.080 --> 01:25.750
YEAH, SURE. MAYBE WE'LL GET
ONE FOR YOU, TOO, DOUGIE.

01:25.818 --> 01:27.919
WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE?
HOW-HOW'D IT GET TIED?

01:27.987 --> 01:29.921
IT WAS ACTUALLY A 3-POINTER
AND 2 TECHNICAL FOULS.

01:29.989 --> 01:31.623
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.240
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T-
A STEAL NOW.

01:33.308 --> 01:35.242
OH, MY GOD. COVER HIM.
JUST COVER HIM.

01:35.310 --> 01:36.094
COVER HIM.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.178
GAH! AHH!

01:38.980 --> 01:40.748
2 MONTHS' RENT.

01:42.384 --> 01:45.453
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

01:47.723 --> 01:49.441
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY,

01:49.509 --> 01:51.443
BUT THANKS FOR DINNER.

01:54.563 --> 01:56.080
THOUGHT DOUG AND CARRIE LEFT.

01:56.149 --> 01:57.849
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:57.916 --> 01:59.417
WATCHING YOU WALLOW
IN A PLACE

01:59.485 --> 02:02.220
I LIKE TO CALL
ROCK BOTTOM.

02:02.287 --> 02:04.055
WHAT?

02:04.122 --> 02:05.023
I STAYED TO HELP YOU.

02:05.090 --> 02:06.791
YOUR GAMBLING IS
CLEARLY OUT OF CONTROL.

02:06.859 --> 02:09.327
NAH, NAH, NAH. I'M JUST
RUNNIN' COLD, ALL RIGHT?

02:09.395 --> 02:12.063
I'M DUE FOR A HOT STREAK.
I KNOW IT.

02:12.130 --> 02:14.432
I SAID THE SAME THING
AFTER I WAGERED

02:14.500 --> 02:16.100
ON PRESIDENT
THOMAS E. DEWEY

02:16.168 --> 02:18.369
AND A SERIES
OF WHITE HEAVYWEIGHTS.

02:18.437 --> 02:19.704
I KICKED MY HABIT.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.673
NOW YOU'VE
GOTTA KICK YOURS.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.557
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, ARTHUR,
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,

02:23.626 --> 02:25.493
BUT I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

02:25.561 --> 02:27.111
LOOK AT YOURSELF!

02:27.179 --> 02:28.896
DESPERATE
AND PENNILESS!

02:28.964 --> 02:29.848
TROLLING THE MEN'S ROOM

02:29.915 --> 02:32.250
FOR ANY TRUCKER WITH
6 BITS IN HIS POCKET.

02:33.618 --> 02:35.820
I JUST CAME IN HERE TO PEE.

02:35.888 --> 02:37.121
THAT'S HOW IT STARTS.

02:39.224 --> 02:42.193
ALL RIGHT, MAYBE I DO
HAVE A PROBLEM,

02:42.261 --> 02:46.398
BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
GO TO, LIKE, GAMBLERS ANONYMOUS?

02:46.465 --> 02:47.932
HUMPH.
WHERE THEY CODDLE YOU

02:48.000 --> 02:50.902
WITH THEIR UNDERSTANDING
AND SUPPORT. HARDLY.

02:50.969 --> 02:52.904
I'M GONNA CURE YOU.

02:52.971 --> 02:54.939
REALLY?
YES.

02:55.007 --> 02:57.842
FROM NOW ON, THE ONLY
MONKEY ON YOUR BACK

02:57.910 --> 03:00.544
IS GONNA BE ME.

03:00.612 --> 03:01.896
I'M JUST SAYIN'
THAT'S THE LAST TIME

03:01.964 --> 03:03.731
I'M LETTING YOU
PICK THE MOVIE.

03:03.799 --> 03:06.184
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU
WON'T WEAR THE 3-D GLASSES,

03:06.252 --> 03:08.269
YOU DON'T HAVE
A RIGHT TO CRITICIZE.

03:08.337 --> 03:11.505
WHOA. LOOK AT YOUR BOOBS.
THEY'RE COMIN' RIGHT AT ME.

03:11.573 --> 03:12.907
NOT TONIGHT THEY AIN'T.

03:14.309 --> 03:16.077
HEY, WHAT'S WITH
THE POLICE BARRICADES?

03:16.145 --> 03:17.929
OK, MY GUESS, YOUR DAD
HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH

03:17.997 --> 03:19.864
COUGH SYRUP, AND HE
CURSED OUT A NEIGHBOR.

03:19.932 --> 03:22.116
HEY, LOU,

03:22.184 --> 03:23.784

OH, COOL. WHAT TIME'S

03:29.675 --> 03:31.459
WHY?

03:31.527 --> 03:32.777
I WANTED YOU GUYS

03:32.845 --> 03:34.946
BUT THE OTHERS SHOT

03:35.013 --> 03:36.314
SORRY.

03:36.381 --> 03:38.016
NO, NOTHIN' TO BE
SORRY ABOUT. IT'S OK.

03:38.083 --> 03:40.184
YEAH. I DON'T THINK
WE CAN MAKE IT ANYWAY,

03:40.252 --> 03:42.387
BECAUSE WE'RE RIGHT

AHEM, PRETTY INTENSE
GAME OF BATTLESHIP.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.090
WELL, THAT SOUNDS

03:46.158 --> 03:48.109
<i>IT IS FUN, DAMN FUN.</i>

03:52.380 --> 03:53.881
HEY.

03:53.949 --> 03:56.718

04:00.422 --> 04:01.373
I DOUBT IT.

YOU LIKE DOGS, DOUG?

05:59.608 --> 06:01.626

06:01.694 --> 06:02.727
I LOVE 'EM.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.261
OH.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.564
DO YOU HAVE A DOG?

06:06.632 --> 06:08.716
NO, I DON'T. BUT I'LL
TELL YOU, IF I FOUND ONE

06:08.784 --> 06:10.602
AS CUTE AS THIS ONE, I'D
PULL THE TRIGGER IN A SECOND.

06:10.669 --> 06:12.270
WELL, YOU CAN HAVE HIM.

06:12.337 --> 06:13.738
COME AGAIN?

06:15.474 --> 06:16.357
SPARKY ISN'T MINE.

06:16.424 --> 06:18.359
I VOLUNTEER
AT THE ANIMAL SHELTER,

06:18.426 --> 06:21.028
AND I'M JUST KEEPING HIM
FOR THE WEEKEND.

06:22.764 --> 06:24.999
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY, DOUG?

06:25.067 --> 06:27.251
IS THERE ENOUGH ROOM
IN YOUR HEART?

06:44.953 --> 06:47.438
DOUG.

06:49.157 --> 06:50.324
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

06:50.392 --> 06:51.425
TAKE IT EASY.

06:51.493 --> 06:53.794
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST
NOT USED TO WAKING UP

06:53.862 --> 06:57.164
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING
TO A STRANGE DOG IN OUR BED.

06:57.232 --> 07:00.435
ACTUALLY, IT'S LIKE 1:30
IN THE AFTERNOON, SO...

07:00.502 --> 07:01.835
SERIOUSLY? WOW.

07:01.904 --> 07:05.273
THEY WEREN'T KIDDING WHEN THEY
SAID DON'T MIX WITH ALCOHOL.

07:05.340 --> 07:06.807
YOU FOUND OUT
THE HARD WAY.

07:06.875 --> 07:08.575
ANYWAY, THIS IS
MY NEW DOG, SPARKY.

07:08.643 --> 07:10.577
I'LL BE BACK
IN A LITTLE BIT-

07:10.645 --> 07:13.213
WHOA. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

07:13.281 --> 07:15.500
NOTHING. I JUST- I ADOPTED A
DOG AT THE- AT THE BLOCK PARTY.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.901
MOST PEOPLE
GO TO A BLOCK PARTY

07:17.969 --> 07:21.339
AND COME BACK
WITH A PIE, NOT A DOG.

07:21.406 --> 07:23.190
OK, I DID BRING HOME
A PIE. YOU MISSED IT.

07:23.259 --> 07:24.876
AGAIN, IT'S, LIKE,
1:30 IN THE AFTERNOON.

07:24.944 --> 07:28.695
ALL RIGHT, HONEY, PLEASE, JUST TAKE
IT BACK TO WHERE HE CAME FROM, PLEASE.

07:28.763 --> 07:30.248
CARE, COME ON,
IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM

07:30.315 --> 07:31.799
THAT THE NEIGHBORS
FINALLY LIKE US.

07:31.866 --> 07:34.785
AND WITH ALL THE RUNNING
AND-HEH- PLAYING AROUND WITH HIM,

07:34.853 --> 07:36.220
BONUS. YOU KNOW WHY?

07:36.287 --> 07:37.855
WASHBOARD.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.643
AH, IT'S GONNA
HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT.

07:41.710 --> 07:42.877
OK.

07:42.944 --> 07:44.646
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU SAID

07:44.713 --> 07:47.548
WHEN YOU TALKED ME INTO
GETTING YOU THAT DUNE BUGGY?

07:47.616 --> 07:49.183
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHEN I FLIPPED THAT THING

07:49.251 --> 07:51.919
AND I GOT MY JAW WIRED SHUT,
I LOST, LIKE, 41/2 POUNDS.

07:51.987 --> 07:55.239
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG? YOU
WANT THE DOG, FINE. IT'S YOURS.

07:55.307 --> 07:56.390
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU'RE GONNA FEED HIM.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.126
YOU'RE GONNA WALK HIM,
IT'S ALL ON YOU.

07:58.193 --> 08:00.444
ABSOLUTELY.
GONNA FEED HIM RIGHT NOW.

08:00.512 --> 08:02.529
COME ON, LET'S GO
FINISH THAT PIE.

08:06.886 --> 08:10.121
DON'T FORGET TO SEPARATE
THE WHITES FROM THE COLORS.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.139
YEAH, WELL,
HAVIN' A LITTLE TROUBLE

08:12.207 --> 08:14.842
FIGURIN' OUT
WHICH ONES ARE THE WHITES.

08:16.211 --> 08:17.745
WATCH THE 'TUDE, JUNKIE.

08:19.047 --> 08:20.648
LOOK, I STILL DON'T GET IT.

08:20.716 --> 08:22.549
I MEAN, HOW IS
DOING YOUR LAUNDRY

08:22.618 --> 08:24.719
HELPIN' ME GET OVER
MY GAMBLING PROBLEM?

08:25.770 --> 08:26.937
WHEN YOU CAME DOWN HERE,

08:27.005 --> 08:29.373
WHAT DID YOU WANNA DO
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE?

08:29.441 --> 08:31.793
WELL, OPEN A WINDOW.

08:33.595 --> 08:36.547
THEN I WANTED TO CALL MY
BOOKIE TO MAKE A COUPLE OF BETS.

08:36.615 --> 08:38.950
I LIKE THE KNICKS, AND
THE LAKERS, THEY'RE A LOCK.

08:39.017 --> 08:40.885
AND DID YOU
PLACE THOSE BETS?

08:40.953 --> 08:42.602
NO.
AND WHY NOT?

08:42.669 --> 08:45.906
BECAUSE THE DIAL ON YOUR PHONE
WAS JAMMED WITH GUM.

08:47.309 --> 08:51.045
NO, BECAUSE I'M KEEPING
YOUR STUBBY FINGERS BUSY.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.296
NOW KEEP SORTING.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.585
I'M JUST TELLIN' YOU, GUY,
IF YOU DON'T STRETCH NOW,

08:57.653 --> 08:58.820
YOU'RE GONNA
FEEL IT TOMORROW.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.324
WHO'S THIS?

09:03.392 --> 09:07.161
OH, IT'S MY NEW DOG, SPARKY.
SPARKY, THIS IS ARTHUR.

09:07.229 --> 09:10.247
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T SNIFF HIS BUTT.

09:12.501 --> 09:13.684
AH.

09:13.752 --> 09:15.536
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

09:15.604 --> 09:18.188
THE LIVER TREATS
IN THE PANTRY ARE MINE.

09:19.825 --> 09:22.042
OH. IS THIS
THE KNICK GAME?

09:22.110 --> 09:24.679
IT WAS. THEY JUST CRUSHED
THE TRAILBLAZERS.

09:24.746 --> 09:25.979
OH. DID THEY?

09:26.047 --> 09:28.382
AND, UH, WOULD YOU
HAPPEN TO KNOW

09:28.450 --> 09:30.251
HOW THE LAKERS FARED?

09:30.318 --> 09:31.985
THEY WON BY, LIKE, 30.

09:32.053 --> 09:33.487
REALLY?

09:33.555 --> 09:37.058
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S
BACK ON A HOT STREAK.

09:38.793 --> 09:39.777
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.779
LET'S GO FIND US
SOME BITCHES.

10:44.209 --> 10:47.094
NO, I HAVEN'T DECIDED
WHO I'M BETTIN' ON TONIGHT.

10:47.162 --> 10:51.064
HEH. YES, FAT CHARLIE, I'VE
BEEN ON QUITE A HOT STREAK.

10:51.132 --> 10:52.466
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

10:52.534 --> 10:53.551
HOLD ON.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.387
HEY, ARTHUR.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.724
HEY! HOW'S MY FAVORITE
RECOVERING ADDICT?

10:59.791 --> 11:01.492
EHH. HANGIN' IN THERE.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.727
HAVE A SEAT.

11:02.794 --> 11:05.062
LET ME JUST MOVE
THESE BOAT CATALOGS.

11:07.065 --> 11:09.249
LET'S TALK
ABOUT WHAT TEAMS

11:09.317 --> 11:13.320
YOUR DISEASED MIND
IS OBSESSED WITH TODAY.

11:13.388 --> 11:16.224
WELL, ACTUALLY INSTEAD
OF TALKING ABOUT BASKETBALL

11:16.291 --> 11:19.827
AND, YOU KNOW, SHOCKIN' ME
WITH A CAR BATTERY,

11:19.894 --> 11:22.497
I- I THOUGHT MAYBE WE CAN,
I DON'T KNOW,

11:22.564 --> 11:24.999
GET TO THE ROOT
OF MY PROBLEM.

11:25.066 --> 11:25.833
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:25.901 --> 11:27.068
WELL, I WAS THINKIN'

11:27.135 --> 11:29.536
THIS WHOLE GAMBLIN' THING
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

11:29.604 --> 11:32.073
WITH MY FATHER NEVER
GIVING ME HIS APPROVAL.

11:32.140 --> 11:33.407
OK, LET'S WORK
WITH THAT.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.709
GREAT. GREAT.

11:34.776 --> 11:38.779
NOW, IF YOUR FATHER ASKED
YOU WHO TO BET ON TONIGHT,

11:38.847 --> 11:43.818
WHAT TEAM WOULD YOU PICK
TO EARN HIS APPROVAL,

11:43.885 --> 11:46.721
THE CELTICS
OR THE TIMBERWOLVES?

11:46.788 --> 11:48.589
WHAT? CELTICS, I GUESS.

11:48.657 --> 11:50.491
AHA.

11:50.559 --> 11:56.430
AND IF HIS LOVE HINGED ON
PICKING THE OVER-UNDER...

11:56.498 --> 11:57.080
UNDER.

11:57.148 --> 11:58.699
UNDER! RIGHTO.

11:58.766 --> 12:01.902
GOD, YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT? I
REALLY GOTTA GET A HANDLE ON THIS,

12:01.970 --> 12:04.121
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW, SOMETIMES
I JUST FEEL SO DESPERATE

12:04.189 --> 12:06.807
THAT I-I FEEL LIKE
GETTIN' UP ON THE ROOF AND-

12:06.875 --> 12:08.358
LET'S PICK THIS UP
TOMORROW.

12:08.426 --> 12:11.228
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

12:11.296 --> 12:12.229
YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:26.511 --> 12:27.611
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

12:27.679 --> 12:29.062
I WAS JUST UPSTAIRS,

12:29.130 --> 12:31.865
AND APPARENTLY SOMEBODY
PEED IN THE HALLWAY.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.118
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.502
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:35.570 --> 12:37.104
THIS ISN'T
WORKIN' OUT FOR ME.

12:37.171 --> 12:38.606
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

12:38.673 --> 12:40.641
DOUG, YOU TOOK
A PERFECTLY GOOD DOG

12:40.709 --> 12:43.477
AND TURNED HIM INTO A
BIG, LAZY EATING MACHINE.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.295
AND IN CASE
YOU HADN'T NOTICED,

12:45.363 --> 12:47.731
ALREADY GOT
ONE OF THOSE.

12:47.799 --> 12:49.316
OH! SLAMMED ME THERE.

12:49.384 --> 12:51.652
HEH HEH. COME ON.
SIT DOWN. WATCH THE TUBE.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.420
EAT SOME DOODLES WITH US.
IT'S FUN.

12:53.488 --> 12:54.521
OK, ALL RIGHT,

12:54.589 --> 12:56.140
NOW, H-HERE'S
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

12:56.207 --> 12:58.709
OK, YOU'RE GONNA WAKE
UP EVERY MORNING EARLY,

12:58.777 --> 13:00.311
AND YOU'RE
GONNA WALK HIM,

13:00.379 --> 13:02.880
<i>AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA FEED HIM DOG FOOD,</i>

13:02.947 --> 13:04.598
AND THEN IF HE
PEES IN THE HOUSE,

13:04.666 --> 13:05.783
YOU'RE GONNA
CLEAN IT UP,

13:05.851 --> 13:07.551
AND IF YOU CAN'T DO
ALL THOSE THINGS,

13:07.619 --> 13:09.720
HE'S GOIN' RIGHT BACK
TO WHERE HE CAME FROM.

13:11.556 --> 13:12.873
I'M GONNA MISS YOU, BUDDY.

13:14.242 --> 13:16.377
COME ON, BOY.
GOTTA TAKE YOU BACK.

13:16.445 --> 13:19.980
BELIEVE ME, IF I COULD TRADE
PLACES WITH YOU, I WOULD.

13:20.048 --> 13:21.916
CARRIE, I'M GLAD
I CAUGHT YOU.

13:21.984 --> 13:24.902
I WANTED TO DROP OFF
THIS DOG TRAINING VIDEO.

13:24.969 --> 13:27.004
IT'S NARRATED
BY BETTY WHITE.

13:27.072 --> 13:28.322
OH, RIGHT.

13:28.389 --> 13:31.725
THAT'S GREAT, BUT I'M ACTUALLY
NOT GONNA BE NEEDING IT, SO-AHH!

13:31.793 --> 13:32.577
YOU OK?

13:32.644 --> 13:34.094
YEAH, IT'S JUST
I GOT A PINCHED NERVE

13:34.162 --> 13:35.663
IN MY NECK.
IT'S KILLIN' ME.

13:35.730 --> 13:37.431
YOU KNOW, I HAD
THAT SAME TROUBLE

13:37.499 --> 13:39.166
UNTIL I GOT
MY MASSAGE CHAIR.

13:39.233 --> 13:40.634
IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.

13:40.702 --> 13:42.637
OH, YEAH, I PRICED
ONE OF THOSE.

13:42.704 --> 13:46.607
AND UNLESS I'M GOIN' HOME WITH ONE
OF THE SALESMEN, AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

13:46.675 --> 13:49.293
ACTUALLY, ONE OF MY
CLIENTS MANUFACTURES THEM,

13:49.360 --> 13:53.330
SO I CAN GET YOU ONE AT A
THIRD OF THE STORE PRICE.

13:53.398 --> 13:54.998
REALLY?
YOU WOULD DO THAT?

13:55.066 --> 13:57.418
AFTER WHAT YOU GUYS DID
RESCUING SPARKY,

13:57.453 --> 13:59.636
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

13:59.704 --> 14:02.023
BLESS YOUR HEARTS.

14:02.090 --> 14:03.658
WELL, DON'T BLESS US.

14:03.725 --> 14:05.893
BLESS ALL OF GOD'S CREATURES.

14:08.763 --> 14:11.498
WELL, I CAN'T TAKE HIM BACK.

14:11.566 --> 14:12.833
WHAT? WHAT HAPPENED?

14:12.900 --> 14:14.468
GLENN'S GONNA GET ME
AN INCREDIBLE DEAL

14:14.536 --> 14:17.471
ON A MASSAGE CHAIR BECAUSE
HE THINKS I'M A GOOD PERSON.

14:17.539 --> 14:18.939
I GOTTA KEEP THAT GOIN'.

14:19.991 --> 14:22.009
WELL, HAVE FUN WITH HIM,
'CAUSE I MOVED ON.

14:22.077 --> 14:23.944
I'M THINKIN' ABOUT
GETTIN' A BIRD NOW.

14:24.012 --> 14:25.129
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

14:25.197 --> 14:27.464
THE DOG WAS YOUR IDEA
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

14:27.532 --> 14:29.300
I DON'T WANNA
TAKE CARE OF HIM.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.534
SO THINK OF SOMETHING.

14:32.888 --> 14:34.722
WELL?

14:34.789 --> 14:36.140
SORRY. I'M THINKIN'
OF BIRD NAMES.

14:36.207 --> 14:37.908
WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF CHET?

14:38.927 --> 14:42.146
OK, HOW ABOUT THIS?
WE TAKE HIM TO THE SHELTER,

14:42.214 --> 14:44.698
AND WE TELL PEOPLE
THAT HE RAN AWAY.

14:44.765 --> 14:47.434
THAT WAY, WE STILL
GET CREDIT FOR THE RESCUE,

14:47.452 --> 14:49.636
PLUS SYMPATHY FOR THE LOSS.
WIN-WIN.

14:49.704 --> 14:51.171
UH-UH. NO WAY.
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

14:51.239 --> 14:52.239
GLENN'S DOWN
AT THE SHELTER

14:52.306 --> 14:53.373
RESCUING A LLAMA OR WHATEVER EVERY DAY.

14:55.276 --> 14:57.261
WHAT IF WE TAKE HIM OUT
OF STATE, LIKE, TO JERSEY?

14:57.329 --> 14:59.046
MMM. TOO CLOSE. TOO CLOSE.

14:59.114 --> 15:01.798
PENNSYLVANIA.
AMISH COUNTRY.

15:01.866 --> 15:05.219
ALL RIGHT, BUT IT'S GONNA SUCK
FOR HIM, 'CAUSE HE LIKES TV.

15:10.008 --> 15:12.326
HEY, DID YOU PUT UP
THE LOST DOG POSTERS?

15:12.393 --> 15:13.493
YEAH.

15:13.561 --> 15:15.579
THEN LOU GAVE ME
A HELL OF A SYMPATHY HUG.

15:15.646 --> 15:17.681
I THINK HE SEPARATED
MY SHOULDER, SO IT...

15:17.749 --> 15:18.883
WELL, DON'T WORRY.

15:18.950 --> 15:21.051
GLENN SAID OUR MASSAGE
CHAIR IS COMIN' TODAY.

15:21.953 --> 15:23.420
OOH.
MAYBE THAT'S IT.

15:24.573 --> 15:26.657
MIRACLES DO HAPPEN.

15:26.724 --> 15:28.526
SPARKY?

15:29.594 --> 15:31.795
HE'S BACK?
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT,

15:31.863 --> 15:35.582
HE MADE IT ALL THE WAY
TO LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA.

15:35.650 --> 15:39.687
LUCKY FOR YOU, THEY WERE ABLE
TO SCAN HIS MICROCHIP IMPLANT.

15:39.755 --> 15:42.139
MICROCHIP. WOW.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.475
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
THE AMISH HAD SCANNERS?

15:45.543 --> 15:48.279
WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING
IS HE'S HOME NOW,

15:48.347 --> 15:50.631
AND YOUR FAMILY IS WHOLE.

15:50.698 --> 15:52.299
THANK YOU.

16:01.342 --> 16:02.276
ARTHUR, HEY.

16:02.343 --> 16:03.610
OH, THERE YOU ARE.

16:03.678 --> 16:05.479
LET'S PROBE
YOUR INNER DEMONS

16:05.546 --> 16:08.265
VIS-À-VIS TONIGHT'S
PACERS-CAVALIERS GAME.

16:08.333 --> 16:11.085
OH. WELL, I, UH-
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

16:11.153 --> 16:13.553
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT GAMBLIN' IN DAYS.

16:13.621 --> 16:14.788
WHAT?
YEAH.

16:14.856 --> 16:16.540
I THINK I'M, UH,
FINALLY CURED.

16:16.608 --> 16:17.808
YOUR THERAPY WORKED.

16:17.876 --> 16:21.511
AND, UH, TO THANK YOU,
I GOT YOU THIS PLANT.

16:21.579 --> 16:22.612
DON'T BE A FOOL.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.015
THINKING YOU'RE CURED
IS PART OF THE DISEASE.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.184
HEY, THAT COST ME
6 BUCKS AT WALGREENS.

16:27.252 --> 16:29.837
I DON'T CARE. JUST TELL ME
WHO'S GONNA WIN TONIGHT.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.039
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:34.642 --> 16:37.010
HAVE YOU BEEN BETTING
USING MY PICKS?

16:38.630 --> 16:40.064
HELLO.

16:40.131 --> 16:42.933
SORRY. I ASSUMED THAT WAS
A RHETORICAL QUESTION.

16:43.001 --> 16:45.235
OF COURSE THAT'S
WHAT I'VE BEEN DOIN'.

16:45.303 --> 16:48.555
AH. SO THAT EXPLAINS
THE FANCY JEWELRY

16:48.623 --> 16:51.692
AND THE WOMEN
AND ALL THE FUR HATS.

16:53.394 --> 16:55.212
YOU SAID
YOU WERE HELPIN' ME.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.598
OK, I DECEIVED YOU,
AND THAT WAS WRONG.

16:57.666 --> 16:59.466
BUT THAT DOESN'T
CHANGE THE REASON

16:59.534 --> 17:01.702
I STARTED HELPING YOU
TO BEGIN WITH.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.036
I LOVE YOU, DANIEL.

17:07.608 --> 17:10.042
SO, PACERS-CAVALIERS-

17:10.111 --> 17:11.744
AH, YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.348
PLEASE. IF I CAN DOUBLE
UP ON TONIGHT'S GAME,

17:14.415 --> 17:16.517
I CAN GET MYSELF
OUT OF THIS HELLHOLE!

17:16.584 --> 17:17.935
YEAH, WELL,
YOU CAN FORGET IT, OK?

17:18.002 --> 17:21.088
'CAUSE YOU'VE SUCKED FROM DANNY
HEFFERNAN'S TEAT FOR THE LAST TIME.

17:21.156 --> 17:23.205
ONE MORE, SON?
NO!

17:23.273 --> 17:25.242
GOOD. I DON'T NEED YOU.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.963
I CAN MAKE SOME VERY
SAVVY PICKS ON MY OWN!

17:29.030 --> 17:32.599
LET'S SEE.
CAVALIERS-PACERS.

17:32.667 --> 17:33.734
OH.

17:33.801 --> 17:36.303
CAVALIERS AND PACERS.

17:36.371 --> 17:40.440
MY COUSIN JEFFREY
USED TO DRIVE A PACER,

17:40.508 --> 17:43.460
ALTHOUGH HE HAD A VERY
CAVALIER ATTITUDE ABOUT IT.

17:45.830 --> 17:48.181
FREE DOG!
WE GOT A FREE DOG HERE.

17:48.249 --> 17:50.217
MAN'S BEST FRIEND.
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ONE.

17:50.284 --> 17:53.320
LADY, TAKE IT HOME WITH YOU.
TAKE IT HOME WITH YOU.

17:53.388 --> 17:55.589
WHAT DO YOU SAY THERE,
GRAMPS? COME ON.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.941
BRING HIM WITH YOU.
BRING HIM WITH YOU.

17:59.261 --> 18:00.761
THERE'S-NOBODY'S TAKIN' HIM.

18:00.828 --> 18:02.096
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

18:02.163 --> 18:03.630
BECAUSE NOBODY'S
SEEN HIM MOVE.

18:03.698 --> 18:05.432
YOU TURNED HIM
INTO YOU.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.167
NO WONDER
NOBODY WANTS HIM.

18:07.235 --> 18:08.568
YOU WANTED ME.

18:08.636 --> 18:10.504
YEAH, THAT WAS A
MILLION YEARS AGO, BUDDY.

18:12.506 --> 18:13.957
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:14.025 --> 18:15.659
L- LET ME HANDLE THIS.
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

18:18.429 --> 18:19.863
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.832
WHERE YOU GOIN'
SO FAST, SWEETHEART?

18:22.900 --> 18:23.950
EXCUSE ME?

18:24.018 --> 18:25.152
YEAH, UH, SEE,
THING IS

18:25.220 --> 18:26.754
THIS DOG JUST
SHOWED UP HERE,

18:26.821 --> 18:29.323
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHATSOEVER TO DO WITH HIM.

18:29.391 --> 18:30.824
YOU SEEM LIKE
A DOG GUY,

18:30.892 --> 18:32.626
AND I JUST LOVE
DOG GUYS.

18:32.693 --> 18:34.345
YEAH, THAT'S-
THAT'S GREAT.

18:34.412 --> 18:36.413
UH, I'M LATE
FOR SOMETHING.

18:36.481 --> 18:37.481
ALL RIGHTY.

18:37.549 --> 18:38.699
NICE GOIN'.

18:38.767 --> 18:41.001
I TRIED.
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:41.019 --> 18:43.170
NEXT TIME, POP A BUTTON
OR PUT A HAND ON HIM.

18:43.237 --> 18:44.271
ALWAYS BE CLOSING.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.041
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:47.108 --> 18:49.343
THERE'S A BUNCH OF FAMILIES
OVER THERE BY THE SWINGS.

18:49.411 --> 18:51.178
COME ON. SOMEBODY WILL
TAKE HIM OVER THERE.

18:51.246 --> 18:52.462
HERE WE GO, MAN.

18:52.530 --> 18:53.597
GO GET IT!

18:53.664 --> 18:55.165
COME ON, NOW.

18:55.233 --> 18:56.316
GO!

18:57.552 --> 18:58.786
GO ON, NOW.

18:58.853 --> 19:00.837
GO-GET OUT OF HERE!
WE DON'T LOVE YOU!

19:00.905 --> 19:02.122
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT? LET'S JUST GO.

19:02.190 --> 19:02.973
ALL RIGHT.

19:04.525 --> 19:06.176
HEY, MAN.
HEY. HEH.

19:06.244 --> 19:07.911
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:07.978 --> 19:10.547
UM, JUST PLAYIN'
WITH OUR DOG.

19:10.615 --> 19:14.017
YEAH. LITTLE GAME CALLED,
"GET OUT OF HERE.

19:14.085 --> 19:15.686
WE DON'T LOVE YOU."

19:18.222 --> 19:20.957
IF YOU CAN'T MUSTER THE
COMPASSION IN YOUR HEARTS

19:21.025 --> 19:22.959
TO CARE FOR
THIS POOR CREATURE,

19:23.027 --> 19:25.462
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO TAKE HIM BACK.

19:26.481 --> 19:27.414
AWESOME!

19:27.482 --> 19:29.683
THAT SOUNDS REALLY GREAT.
THANK YOU.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.885
WAIT.
QUICK QUESTION, THOUGH.

19:31.953 --> 19:34.305
IF WE GIVE HIM
BACK TO YOU,

19:34.372 --> 19:35.922
WHERE DOES
THAT LEAVE US,

19:35.990 --> 19:37.575
