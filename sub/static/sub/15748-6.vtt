WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.670
- I know what I'm doing.
- Do you?
- Trust me.

00:02.719 --> 00:04.230
That estate money's as good as ours.

00:04.280 --> 00:08.390
I give you the Loxley Charitable
Foundation for Former Servicemen.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.830
- You can have the job.
- Mr Grove.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.270
I'll break it to him gently.
You'll need his support.

00:12.320 --> 00:15.150
That man in the store - we
were childhood sweethearts.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.230
Lots of things happened
during the war.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.350
Ernest is Billy's baby.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.000
I want to have fun.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.400
Alcohol after hours.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.320
Violette Selfridge. Does your
father know you're here?

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.200 --> 01:16.910
There's a telephone call
for you, Mr Selfridge.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.680
It's Inspector Harkness from
Bond Street police station.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.720
I see.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.040
Of course.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.990
The police aren't pursuing
a prosecution against you.

01:42.040 --> 01:44.040
This time.

01:44.520 --> 01:47.110
But they said that you were
in a compromising position.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.160
I didn't do anything.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.590
You will not leave this house
or speak on the phone.

01:52.640 --> 01:53.910
You're not serious?

01:53.960 --> 01:57.560
I'm just glad that your mother's
not here to witness your shame.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.880
Take care, Duke. Bye.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.800
It was fun while it lasted.

02:14.040 --> 02:16.980
- Are we going to reopen?
- I'm working on it.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.230
Just need a bit of time.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.020
Gordon Selfridge, Deputy Manager.

02:35.480 --> 02:39.030
Pleased to meet you. Gordon
Selfridge, Deputy Manager.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.470
Good morning. Gordon
Selfridge, Deputy Manager.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.120
Good morning to you too, Mr Gordon.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.790
Deputy Manager - Gordon!

02:48.840 --> 02:52.720
Barely out of short trousers and I'm
expected to take orders from him.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.790
Finish your breakfast. You
haven't touched your eggs.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.840
I can't. I feel sick.

03:00.960 --> 03:02.550
Why did he bother asking me to apply

03:02.600 --> 03:06.190
if he already knew he was going to
give it to his son? It's humiliating.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.640
You're still his right-hand man,
whatever title his son has.

03:10.640 --> 03:14.990
Exactly. I do all the work,
get none of the recognition.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.910
Can't we be grateful
for what we've got?

03:18.200 --> 03:21.800
A roof over our heads, healthy
children, each other?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.800
Well...

03:26.040 --> 03:30.230
If he thinks I'm taking
his son in hand...

03:30.280 --> 03:32.620
he's got another think coming.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.520
Goodbye, my dear.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.880
Miss Pertree...

04:21.000 --> 04:23.790
Did I tell you to move the
tortoiseshell rouge cases?

04:23.840 --> 04:26.110
I'm sure I haven't touched
a thing, Mrs Edwards.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.630
Well, there's three missing.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.780
The autumnal shades eye
shadow has gone too.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.550
Miss Calthorpe, have you been
messing with my counter?

04:35.600 --> 04:37.740
I would never be so bold.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.990
Are you quite certain you haven't
touched this display?

04:42.040 --> 04:45.440
I know better than to interfere
with your work, Mrs Edwards.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.310
Then we've got a thief.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.350
Well, don't look at me.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.900
Whoever it is has had a tawny
boater off us and all.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.990
Ground floor, please. Thank you.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.310
I know that you were
the natural candidate.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.760
You would have been justified
in assuming the job was yours.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.320
You're a Selfridge. There's
no more natural a choice.

05:29.880 --> 05:33.280
I appreciate you being so...
magnanimous, Mr Grove.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.200
I'm... content to be
a shoulder to lean upon.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.550
Mr Gordon, I have just been
accused of being a thief.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.990
- I have not accused anybody of anything.
- Ladies, please, one at a time.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.350
That is not what I
said, Miss Calthorpe.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.320
None of my girls would do such a thing.
I can vouch for them personally.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.830
I wasn't insinuating that. YOU
were the one making accusations.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.710
- I'm not making any accusations.
- Ladies, be quiet!

06:06.760 --> 06:10.480
Ah. Mr Gordon. It would appear fashion
has become a victim of crime.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.830
You're not alone. Now, Mrs
Edwards, what are you missing?

06:13.880 --> 06:17.470
Tortoiseshell make-up cases and
autumnal shades eye shadow but -

06:17.520 --> 06:20.750
- Miss Calthorpe, what about you?
- A tawny boater with a taupe ribbon.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.190
- Miss Mardle?
- A burnt sienna day dress and -

06:24.240 --> 06:27.040
Everything that's
missing... is brown.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.790
Well, one would hardly describe
burnt sienna as... brown.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.590
- Tortoiseshell is a combination of colors.
- Quite. Ladies,

06:33.640 --> 06:35.110
if you'll excuse me for a moment,

06:35.160 --> 06:38.430
I think I'll have an answer
for you very shortly.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.190
Ah. Well, there you are, Mrs Edwards.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.560
- Nobody was accusing you of anything.
- Yes, you were -
- Ladies!

06:52.080 --> 06:55.550
Monsieur Longchamp, I understood
you were to arrive this afternoon.

06:55.600 --> 06:59.030
Ah, Monsieur Gordon! Pleased
to see you again.

06:59.080 --> 07:03.710
I didn't want to waste any time getting
started on my first window display.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.630
Ah. On that subject,

07:05.680 --> 07:09.950
it's probably for the best if
you inform the departments before
you appropriate their stock.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.870
That way we can avoid
any unnecessary...

07:13.200 --> 07:15.540
excitement amongst the staff.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.870
People will always moan. They hate anything
that interferes with their little routine.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.640
You know, they... they're just so...

07:24.160 --> 07:26.430
'This is how we do it here'.

07:28.040 --> 07:31.240
But the truth is, the only thing
we can count on is change.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.630
You and I are young.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.680
We are the future.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.150
If we dare to grasp it.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.220
Yes. Yes, that's all well
and good. It certainly -

07:45.520 --> 07:47.510
It is only a prototype.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.560
Gosh.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.760
Harry Selfridge is here to see you.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.400
Ask him in.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.480
- Victor.
- Mr Selfridge.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.320
Wow. Quite a place you've got here.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.310
Congratulations.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.590
Well, if I can keep it open.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.670
The police have been
flexing their muscles.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.440
Apparently I'm not sufficiently
contributing to their pensions.

08:29.600 --> 08:33.590
I suppose you must know that my daughter
was caught up in those events.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.840
- I can only apologise.
- Hm.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.590
Did you notice who she was with?

08:38.640 --> 08:41.940
I fear that she's fallen
in with the wrong crowd.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.070
It wasn't Violette's fault.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.600
I have nothing but respect for
you and I respect your daughter.

08:49.920 --> 08:54.030
You? The police report
said that she -

08:54.080 --> 08:57.020
They exaggerated. We
did nothing untoward.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.240
My children are still reeling
from the death of their mother.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.600
Violette is not herself
at this moment.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.860
I will ask you to leave her alone.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.420
Am I making myself clear?

09:15.720 --> 09:17.460
Perfectly clear.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.150
Ladies, if you could all follow me,

09:26.200 --> 09:28.870
I have found our missing merchandise.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.870
I've never been allowed
in here before.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.060
Come on in. Don't be shy.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.790
I've always fancied myself
as a creative person.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.030
You? The only thing
you make is trouble.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.580
- Hey!
- May I introduce you to
our new head of display,

09:49.880 --> 09:51.880
Pierre Longchamp.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.880
Bonjour tout le monde.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.720
Please do forgive me. This
is... It's a work in progress.

10:14.560 --> 10:18.480
Looks like Mr Gordon's first appointment
might work out rather well.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.590
How does it turn round?

10:24.640 --> 10:27.430
- It's so clever.
- Marvellous! It's like magic.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.870
He was always going to inherit
the store, you know.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.710
It was always going to be his.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.510
It's moving!

10:33.560 --> 10:37.440
All right, everyone. Entertainment's
over. Back to your positions.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.670
Come on, come on. Chop-chop.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.470
You're quite the showman, aren't you?

10:41.520 --> 10:43.510
Bit of your old man in you, I reckon.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.550
Look at me. I'm shaking like a leaf.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.600
You were terrific.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.040
Morning.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.190
Ah, Miss Webb. Pleasure
to see you again.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.030
Is there anything one of our
ladies can help you with?

11:10.080 --> 11:13.600
I'm here on business today. I have
a meeting with Mr Selfridge.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.000
Oh, very good. How are the plans
for the Selfridge Estate?

11:17.400 --> 11:19.400
Coming along nicely.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.750
Our architect has created
all the plans,

11:23.800 --> 11:26.310
including sections and
elevations for the cottages.

11:26.360 --> 11:30.000
And to be frank, we're only
waiting on the money now.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.320
Is there a problem?

11:34.040 --> 11:35.310
Harry?

11:36.560 --> 11:40.560
Well, only that I've underestimated
the English love for bureaucracy.

11:41.280 --> 11:45.670
I've booked engineers
and builders and -

11:45.720 --> 11:49.030
Come to dinner with me tonight.
I want you to meet my family.

11:49.080 --> 11:53.550
Harry, this is a business meeting.
We have business to discuss.

11:53.600 --> 11:54.790
Is that a yes?

11:54.840 --> 11:56.840
It's a little fast.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.420
I'm asking you to dinner,
not to marry me.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.230
It's... not a good idea.

12:06.280 --> 12:12.200
Well, the truth is, my daughter's
driving me to distraction but...

12:12.880 --> 12:15.680
if you're there, she'll
have to behave.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.830
What can I say?

12:30.280 --> 12:32.830
There's been a delay. The
banks are being slow.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.390
Could be stringing you along
while he investigates us.

12:35.440 --> 12:38.630
If he were suspicious, he would not
have invited me to meet his family.

12:38.680 --> 12:41.430
Jesus! Is he in love with you?

12:41.480 --> 12:44.510
I don't know. And if it means we get
enough money to start a new life,

12:44.560 --> 12:46.560
then it's worth it.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.390
I can't wait to get out of this city.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.590
Do you really think it'll
be so different in America?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.350
I want to be able to
walk down a street

12:55.400 --> 12:57.390
without looking over my shoulder.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.710
No-one's luck lasts forever.

13:00.440 --> 13:04.240
All right. Here's to a fresh start.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.870
I went to a club! I did
not do anything wrong.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.150
Violette, you were arrested!

13:13.200 --> 13:16.280
- I'm being imprisoned in my own house.
- Oh...

13:17.400 --> 13:18.870
I'll go.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.720
Gordon, why don't you tell everyone
about your first day at the helm?

13:23.360 --> 13:24.990
Of course. Well, erm -

13:25.040 --> 13:29.310
So, you were working with Harry
and now you're his lover.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.950
You have investor and
suitor all in one.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.150
- Marie.
- Very convenient.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.710
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, excuse me. I meant no offense.

13:36.760 --> 13:38.750
My English is not perfect.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.800
I meant 'fortunate'.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.620
Nice of you to join us, Violette.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.750
You remember Miss Webb?

13:56.080 --> 13:58.630
- I hear you're dating my father.
- Oh!

13:58.680 --> 14:00.390
Well, it's early days.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.840
- A word to the wise -
- Violette.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.030
There was me thinking I was
going to be bored tonight.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.180
Other people's families
are usually so dull.

14:15.280 --> 14:19.160
You should be open. Must be
losing money hand over fist.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.640
Same terms as before?

14:28.320 --> 14:30.320
It's triple now.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.870
You're not serious?

14:34.920 --> 14:37.590
You crossed me, Colleano. Got to pay.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.600
I can't make that.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.020
Thanks for the drink.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.310
So, the staff went from wanting
to kill Monsieur Longchamp

14:51.360 --> 14:53.560
to eating out of his hand.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.470
I don't remember approving
a new window display.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.510
You did leave me in charge, Pa.

14:59.560 --> 15:03.080
If you'll excuse me, I must pack
for my business trip tomorrow.

15:03.840 --> 15:05.070
What trip?

15:05.120 --> 15:07.830
I leave for Paris in the
morning. Thought I'd said.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.190
How long will you be gone?

15:09.240 --> 15:12.190
I'm meeting a potential backer.
So as long as it takes.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.440
- How long is that?
- As long as it takes. I just said.

15:19.760 --> 15:22.860
Let's all have coffee
in the drawing room, hm?

15:23.120 --> 15:26.480
May I be excused or is
coffee compulsory too?

15:35.120 --> 15:37.310
She must be punishing
me for something.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.710
Why else would she be
dating a club owner?

15:39.760 --> 15:42.390
Well, the first man a
girl falls in love with

15:42.440 --> 15:44.780
is often just like her father.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.190
We're attracted to what's familiar.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.830
- Hm.
- We usually get over it.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.680
Well, I'm nothing like
Victor Colleano.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.310
If you don't want to lose her,

15:53.360 --> 15:56.660
you have to stop treating
her like a little girl.

16:02.800 --> 16:06.350
This might be a good moment
for you to speak to Serge.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.950
Perhaps it is best
if we don't interfere.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.830
What happens between
husband and wife -

16:10.880 --> 16:12.880
We did agree.

16:14.280 --> 16:18.200
Very well. Of course.
Whatever you say.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.470
What is it, Mama? What do you want?

16:33.520 --> 16:35.520
Rosalie is not happy.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.990
Her grandmother spoke to me.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.390
What has my marriage to
do with Lois Selfridge -

16:41.440 --> 16:43.150
or you, for that matter?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.070
Because we live with
them. We need them.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.110
- YOU need them, to pay your bills.
- Serge.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.270
Everyone in this house
is expecting me to fail

16:50.320 --> 16:52.870
and this is my chance to
make something of myself.

16:52.920 --> 16:56.120
A marriage also needs tending
if it is to grow.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.840
Talk to her.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.670
About what?

17:05.720 --> 17:09.430
Americans love to talk
about their feelings.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.030
Oh, please God, no.

17:11.079 --> 17:14.150
Your father and I didn't
set you a very good example.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.950
We seldom saw each other.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.339
Let alone shared our feelings.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.599
Your father would rather
have shot himself.

17:26.599 --> 17:30.280
I... don't know how to
be the husband she wants.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.830
Then treat her like an attractive
girl you do not yet know.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.880
You never have any trouble
making THEM happy.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.750
Billy's been loitering on the street.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.100
Mr Grove walked straight
past him yesterday.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.270
Thank goodness he's so caught
up with this nonsense at work

17:53.320 --> 17:56.390
to pay any attention to what's
going on around him.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.270
If Mr Grove finds out
Ernest isn't his,

17:58.320 --> 18:01.120
it'll be the end of
us, I know it will.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.560
Well, we... we just have
to give Billy what he wants.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
We do it in secret.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.070
Let me sort everything out.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.790
And please don't worry yourself
about it any more.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.040
It's all going to be fine.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.030
It's lovely.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.070
How does he do it?

18:30.120 --> 18:32.110
- Oh!
- Grace!

18:32.160 --> 18:33.910
- What have you done?
- Oh, sorry, I -

18:33.960 --> 18:37.230
Don't touch it! It's completely
ruined. You clumsy idiot!

18:37.280 --> 18:39.870
Monsieur Longchamp, that is
no way to speak to a lady,

18:39.920 --> 18:41.950
let alone one who is
working in our store.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.940
Monsieur Gordon, I
did not see you there.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.840
You must excuse me,
mademoiselle. I...

18:51.200 --> 18:53.190
I apologise.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.240
Apology accepted.

18:59.040 --> 19:03.000
- It is pretty, non?
- Yes, quite.

19:03.840 --> 19:07.200
But the best... the
best is yet to come.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.750
I wish to bring the essence
of France to England.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.710
The beautiful garments that
all French women wear.

19:14.760 --> 19:18.990
But yet I cannot find
anywhere in this...

19:19.040 --> 19:21.580
gargantuan temple to conformity...

19:21.880 --> 19:25.680
Where are the ceintures?
The culottes bouffantes?

19:26.960 --> 19:31.240
- I'm not quite sure I...
- Exactement. They're not in here.

19:33.520 --> 19:37.400
We could bring les dessous
affriolants to London

19:37.960 --> 19:40.300
but at a fraction of the cost.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.430
Yes. Yes, I see.

19:42.480 --> 19:47.190
My display will bring every
London woman to Selfridges,

19:47.240 --> 19:49.950
dragging her husband and
his check book behind her.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
I'll try.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.580
Do not try, Mr Selfridge.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.280
Do.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.230
Thank you for sticking up for me.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.380
What else was I going
to do? You're my girl.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.760
I mean... if you'd like to be.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.600
Erm... I'll think about it.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.870
All right.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.920
I've thought about it
and the answer's yes.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.310
Mr Crabb.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.960
I have an order from Monsieur
Longchamp for a new window display.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.150
Monsieur Longchamnp and I are very
concerned that English women

20:43.200 --> 20:46.140
are being denied the
dessous affriolants.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.160
Mr Grove?

20:50.680 --> 20:52.880
Oh, er... excuse me. Sorry.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.920
It's all French to me.

20:58.960 --> 21:02.760
Well, who are we to stand
in Mr Gordon's way?

21:03.560 --> 21:05.560
Thank you, Mr Grove.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.270
I wasn't sure you'd come.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.590
That's what you want
for me, isn't it?

21:21.640 --> 21:24.320
Shopping, gossip and marriage.

21:27.760 --> 21:30.030
I want you to marry one day.

21:31.320 --> 21:35.020
But gentlemen won't marry a
woman who's been disgraced.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.380
Perhaps I don't want
to marry a gentleman.

21:40.880 --> 21:45.390
Why don't you come work with
me on the Selfridge Estate?

21:45.440 --> 21:47.790
Why on earth would that
be of interest to me?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.960
Because it's a cause that your
mother would have loved.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.880
Now, have you two declared a truce?

21:58.440 --> 22:02.240
My father has suggested that
I come and work for you both.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.760
That... would be wonderful!

22:10.440 --> 22:13.540
The building and planning
work are all in hand.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.550
What I really need

22:15.600 --> 22:18.600
is for somebody to organize
fundraising for furniture.

22:19.640 --> 22:21.750
Raffle tickets and rattling buckets?

22:21.800 --> 22:23.790
No, thank you.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.670
It's no good providing
servicemen's families with homes

22:26.720 --> 22:28.990
if they have nowhere to sit.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.160
I suppose I could organize a party.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.550
I'm always having to go to
friends' charity events.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.230
They can finally repay the favor.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.480
That sounds just the thing.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.550
I have to confess,

22:42.600 --> 22:44.940
I'm incredibly envious of you.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.840
Good heavens. Why?

22:49.200 --> 22:52.070
You have your own career,
your own life.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.590
I don't know how you managed it.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.980
Well, I didn't have a choice.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.520
Come on.

23:00.640 --> 23:05.310
Quick turn around the Burlington
Arcade? Won't be half an hour.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.430
I'm going to get home to Frank.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.510
Night.

23:08.560 --> 23:10.560
- Night.
- Night.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.600
Ooh, sorry.

23:24.160 --> 23:27.280
You can't spare a penny for men
who fought for king and country?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.200
All right, Kitty?

23:42.040 --> 23:44.640
Kitty! Kitty, it's me! It's George!

23:45.080 --> 23:46.910
Let's get out of here.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.960
It's all right. It's
all right. I've got you.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.780
We were wondering if
you needed any help.

23:55.870 --> 23:56.870
I'm fine, thank you.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.860
One thing I know is
how to throw a party.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.440
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Not him.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.230
And definitely not her.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.190
This will not do at all.

24:08.240 --> 24:12.430
A guest must either be charming, beautiful
or rich. Preferably all three.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.990
What concern is it of yours?

24:14.040 --> 24:16.590
Your father asked me to
be part of this family.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.580
So you must let me save
you from yourself.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.150
I also have a list.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.200
The right people.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.270
And who are male and unmarried.

24:28.320 --> 24:31.560
You must meet a man, get
married. Fly this coop.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.310
If you'd like to invite these
men, I'm happy for you to.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.680
There are invitations and
envelopes here. Help yourself.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.950
We don't mind rolling up
our sleeves, do we, Marie?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.150
Grandma, do you mind
if I use the telephone?

24:44.200 --> 24:47.520
- I do need to hire a band.
- Of course. Go ahead.

24:52.800 --> 24:56.960
- Shall we get started?
- I have... headache.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.440
- Colleano's.
- Oh. Hello, Elsa.

25:08.800 --> 25:12.100
- May I speak to Victor, please?
- "Hello, Violette."

25:15.360 --> 25:19.160
I'm afraid he's out at the moment.
Shall I ask him to return your call?

25:20.360 --> 25:22.360
Thank you.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Victor...

25:42.800 --> 25:44.600
Michael Regan.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.670
I know who you are.

25:49.960 --> 25:53.150
It is a nice spot. I've
always thought so.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.710
I'm not selling.

25:54.760 --> 25:58.080
The last thing I want is a club.
It's too much like hard work.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.950
Did the pair of you work this
routine out between you?

26:02.000 --> 26:05.500
Purkiss comes in, turns the
screws on and then you...

26:05.600 --> 26:07.870
waltz in and save the day.

26:07.920 --> 26:11.520
Oh, he's no friend of mine
but I know how he operates.

26:11.760 --> 26:15.160
That's why I make it my business
to keep his boss in my pocket.

26:16.280 --> 26:19.080
- And in return you'd expect...?
- Nothing.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.550
Nothing much. A bit of gambling.

26:26.640 --> 26:29.640
A roulette table would
fit nicely back there.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.510
You'd have this place from
under me within a week.

26:37.560 --> 26:40.500
I already told you I
don't want your club.

26:40.880 --> 26:44.600
But unless you deal with Purkiss,
you won't have it either.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.960
Thank you. Goodbye.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.110
Did you find out how they're
back on the street?

27:00.160 --> 27:02.500
Lord Loxley put up their bail.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.230
Loxley?! What's he got
to do with anything?

27:06.280 --> 27:09.950
His new foundation's paying for
their legal representation too.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.550
It's all part of this war
with Harry Selfridge.

27:12.600 --> 27:16.630
Harry stands up for
you female workers

27:16.680 --> 27:19.230
so Loxley champions
unemployed servicemen,

27:19.280 --> 27:21.110
says you're taking their jobs.

27:21.160 --> 27:24.100
Charlie was always
a nasty piece of work.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.230
Rumor at the front was he
did time before the war.

27:27.280 --> 27:30.400
- Is that so?
- Silas hasn't got the
brains he was born with.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.080
He'll do anything Charlie
tells him to.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.310
Right. I'm going to see Lord Loxley.

27:38.360 --> 27:41.390
- He needs to know what
these men are capable of.
- That's not a good idea.

27:41.440 --> 27:46.520
Well, nor was getting those men
drunk in the first place but
somebody's got to do something.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
I'll go.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.630
Well...

27:54.680 --> 27:57.780
- I should be getting home.
- I'll show you out.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.590
If there's anything you need,

28:01.640 --> 28:05.000
anything at all, you
can always rely on me.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.150
You're already saved me once today.

28:08.200 --> 28:11.960
I appreciate it. I really do.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.480
Good heavens.

28:33.160 --> 28:35.160
He's not in, Mr Crabb.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.070
I need an appointment with him
at the earliest opportunity.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.790
It is a matter of the utmost urgency.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.790
Come to Paris with me.

28:52.840 --> 28:55.840
- What?
- You have half an hour to pack a case.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.310
What is this?

28:59.360 --> 29:01.760
Why the sudden change of heart?

29:02.680 --> 29:04.990
We've barely spoken
for days and now this?

29:07.080 --> 29:09.680
I never know what you want from me.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.870
Serge!

29:13.920 --> 29:15.920
Serge, stop!

29:23.880 --> 29:26.870
Serge's invited me to Paris.
Isn't that wonderful?

29:26.920 --> 29:30.020
Darling! I'm sure you'll
have a lovely time.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.030
Such a happy couple.

29:35.080 --> 29:38.380
Let's hope they're still
smiling when they return.

29:43.040 --> 29:47.440
We've been notified that you intend to
sell 5% of your holding in the company.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.870
I've been asked to prepare
the documents of sale.

29:49.920 --> 29:53.790
It's the only way that I can raise the
capital Miss Webb and I need to build.

29:53.840 --> 29:56.950
You realize that if you do this,
you lose your majority stake?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.550
It wasn't an easy decision.

29:58.600 --> 30:02.000
But between us, the Selfridge family
will still control the store.

30:03.840 --> 30:07.440
I feel some personal culpability
in this matter, Mr Selfridge.

30:08.360 --> 30:11.230
If I hadn't spoken out against
the store loaning you the money,

30:11.280 --> 30:12.990
you wouldn't be in this predicament.

30:13.040 --> 30:17.200
You did what you believed to be
right and I respect you for it.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.670
I beg you to reconsider.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.440
Selfridges will no longer be yours.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.920
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.600
Now, where do I sign?

30:43.600 --> 30:45.790
Mr Frank Edwards is at the door.

30:45.840 --> 30:49.000
He does not have an appointment.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.800
Show him in.

30:57.840 --> 31:01.550
Whatever game you're playing with Harry
Selfridge, it doesn't include my wife.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.790
I'm a grown man. I don't play games.

31:03.840 --> 31:08.430
- Then why stand bail for
the men who attacked her?
- Ah! Allegedly, attacked her.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.870
- They're nothing to you.
- On the contrary,

31:10.920 --> 31:14.030
they're a tragic example of how
our once-venerated war heroes

31:14.080 --> 31:15.270
are being persecuted.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.550
Heroes?! Do you know what they did?

31:17.600 --> 31:22.470
No. But the judge does and he
believed them worthy of bail.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.520
I merely provided it.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.790
I've got a court report of a case against
Charlie Copperstone. He assaulted a woman.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.670
He wasn't a hero before the war
and service hasn't made him one.

31:32.720 --> 31:36.230
Don't you reformers believe in
innocent until proven guilty?

31:36.280 --> 31:40.150
A big public trial like this would
provide a platform for their cause.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.190
And let you restore your character.

31:42.240 --> 31:47.310
Well, any positive reflection on
myself is... merely incidental.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.630
And my wife gets put through the wringer
by every paper in the country.

31:50.680 --> 31:53.640
Which is an irony, coming
from you, Frank.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.880
I look forward to
seeing you in court.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.230
That article about
you is just the start.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.150
I think you should consider
dropping the charges.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.550
What?! After all I've been through?

32:08.600 --> 32:10.550
If I could think of another way...

32:10.600 --> 32:13.400
I'm just trying to
stop you being hurt.

32:14.360 --> 32:17.030
Can we not try to put this behind us?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
No. I can't.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.900
There's no way those men
are walking away scot free!

32:39.160 --> 32:41.230
What are you doing here?

32:43.000 --> 32:46.320
You know you said if there was
anything you could do to help?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.940
Well, turns out there is.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.960
You can't tell Frank.

33:09.440 --> 33:11.430
Good evening.

33:11.480 --> 33:13.470
Lady Henry, how lovely to see you.

33:13.520 --> 33:16.920
Miss Frances, have you been badgered
to buy a raffle ticket?

33:21.400 --> 33:25.230
Violette, this is Lord Forgille
of Forgille Textiles.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.270
Charmed.

33:27.320 --> 33:30.550
He's not a real lord but
his money is real enough.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.670
- Marie!
- He's also deaf.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.270
We're going to exceed our target.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.110
- I have to say, I am really impressed.
- You are?

33:45.160 --> 33:48.040
- Mm-hm.
- That means a lot. Thank you.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.630
I see why my father likes you.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.030
Can an old man have a
dance with his daughter?

33:55.080 --> 33:57.080
Of course, Pa.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.159
Very proud of you.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.840
Thanks, Pa.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.400
George.

34:28.719 --> 34:30.630
You can do this.

34:30.679 --> 34:32.070
I know you can.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.510
And I'll be right here by your side.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.750
I won't let anything happen to you.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.800
Come on.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.310
George. What are you doing here?

34:55.199 --> 34:56.389
Read this.

34:56.440 --> 34:58.980
This is who your friend really is.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.950
The one you were lying to protect.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.320
- I didn't lie to no-one.
- I wasn't the first girl he attacked.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.910
And I won't be the last either,

35:07.960 --> 35:10.670
unless you do the right
thing and tell the truth.

35:10.720 --> 35:13.190
- Leave me alone.
- Do you have a sister, Silas?

35:13.240 --> 35:15.780
- What of it?
- What if it were her?

35:16.600 --> 35:18.800
You intimidating my friend?

35:19.840 --> 35:22.940
I'll have to speak to
my solicitor about that.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.560
This is who Charlie Copperstone is.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.780
He did time for bashing
a girl's face in.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.040
And now he's back in court for
trying to do worse to my friend.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.110
- He's a liar.
- You're a disgrace to the uniform.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.160
Oh, George.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.920
Give it here.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.280
Take it from me.

36:20.200 --> 36:22.200
Do the right thing.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.600
Come on, Kitty.

36:36.400 --> 36:40.070
- What are we celebrating?
- I have secured the funds for the project.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.710
How much do you need to begin work?

36:41.760 --> 36:43.760
That's fantastic!

36:44.600 --> 36:46.710
£4,000 to secure building materials.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.190
- It'll reduce costs if we buy in bulk.
- Mm-hm.

36:49.240 --> 36:53.040
- £3,000 for labour.
- I'll put £7,000 in the
account tomorrow morning.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.500
- What's going on?
- Thanks.

37:46.740 --> 37:48.570
Perkiss won't be troubling
us any more.

37:48.620 --> 37:51.380
You must be George. I'm Regan.

37:52.340 --> 37:54.330
We're expanding, George.

37:54.380 --> 37:56.980
A games room in the back. Roulette.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.580
- Just gambling?
- You'll barely know we're here.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.650
We're back in business.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.890
Ah, Mr Gordon.

38:25.940 --> 38:27.930
Mr Grove. What can I do for you?

38:27.980 --> 38:32.050
Monsieur Longchamp's 'dessous affriolants'
have arrived from his designer.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.250
I thought you might
like to sign for them,

38:34.300 --> 38:37.420
as it's your personal project
and... responsibility.

38:37.540 --> 38:39.540
Of course.

38:40.820 --> 38:43.290
- Thank you, Mr Grove.
- Thank you.

38:45.020 --> 38:47.540
This, I am looking forward to.

38:54.420 --> 38:59.900
Miss Blenkinsop, erm... what does
'les dessous affriolants' mean?

39:01.340 --> 39:03.610
My French is a little rusty.

39:10.660 --> 39:12.660
Here we are.

39:20.580 --> 39:22.570
Oh, my good lord.

39:22.620 --> 39:25.410
So that we can prevent running
out of essential goods.

39:25.460 --> 39:28.450
There's no point in doing
it in the first place if -

39:28.500 --> 39:30.770
- - if no-one acts on it.
- Erm... Mr Gordon?

39:30.820 --> 39:33.730
- It'll have to wait, Miss
Calthorpe. This is pressing.
- It can't.

39:33.780 --> 39:35.810
I'm sure it can. Now, I understand -

39:35.860 --> 39:40.100
Mr Longchamp is putting women's
knickers in Selfridge's window.

39:51.900 --> 39:53.900
Oh, my word.

39:53.980 --> 39:55.970
These denigrate all women.

39:56.020 --> 39:57.610
Well, I think they're beautiful.

39:57.660 --> 40:01.970
That's as may be, Miss Calthorpe,
but I for one will not be
jettisoning my girdle for them.

40:02.020 --> 40:04.020
Connie!

40:11.340 --> 40:13.340
Hi, Pa.

40:18.740 --> 40:20.740
You knew!

40:23.130 --> 40:24.130
Oh, Kitty!

40:24.180 --> 40:27.930
- What are you doing here?
- Silas has withdrawn his
statement supporting Charlie.

40:27.980 --> 40:30.250
He's made a new one,
telling the truth.

40:30.300 --> 40:33.890
Charlie's had to change his plea
to guilty. He's going to prison.

40:33.940 --> 40:37.460
Oh... Oh, thank goodness.

40:38.380 --> 40:40.780
Oh, it's good to see you happy.

40:41.020 --> 40:43.490
I don't think I realised the
toll this had taken on you.

40:43.540 --> 40:46.970
- I'm sorry about that. I'm
sorry about everything.
- It's all right, Frank.

40:47.020 --> 40:48.690
Everything's going to be all right.

40:48.740 --> 40:52.060
Take me to lunch. We've got
something to celebrate.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.500
Why would we leave?

40:56.340 --> 40:58.410
The job's not finished.

40:58.740 --> 41:01.890
£7,000 will be in the
business account by now.

41:01.940 --> 41:02.970
I'm a signatory.

41:03.020 --> 41:05.890
We clear it out and get
steerage to New York.

41:05.940 --> 41:07.810
What about the government money?

41:07.860 --> 41:10.660
If we wait, we can
get four times that.

41:12.060 --> 41:14.730
Harry will expect me to hire a team.

41:14.860 --> 41:17.370
A civil engineer will
see straight through me.

41:17.420 --> 41:19.610
- It's too risky.
- You're losing your nerve.

41:19.660 --> 41:21.650
No, I'm not losing my nerve.

41:21.700 --> 41:23.690
You've gone soft.

41:23.740 --> 41:25.740
I have not.

41:26.420 --> 41:29.500
Prove it. Stay in for the long game.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.620
Fine.

41:39.460 --> 41:43.450
'Downright offensive', 'Incredibly
unfitting'. Ah, yes, here we are.

41:43.500 --> 41:48.970
'These outrageous French camisoles
have no place in a woman's wardrobe

41:49.020 --> 41:50.570
much less a high street window.

41:50.620 --> 41:53.820
This time Harry Selfridge
has gone too far.'

41:57.300 --> 42:00.100
Well, let's take a
look at the damage.

42:13.780 --> 42:16.650
- Congratulations, son, you
hit it out of the park.
- Thanks, Pa.

42:16.700 --> 42:20.100
I'm very impressed with your
initiative, Mr Gordon.

42:20.260 --> 42:22.260
Aren't you, Mr Grove?

42:26.140 --> 42:28.140
Yes... Yes, very.

42:33.740 --> 42:35.940
- Don't do it again.
- No, Pa.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.490
Well done.

42:43.540 --> 42:47.220
Well, congratulations. I was on
the fence but I'm a believer now.

42:49.300 --> 42:52.170
He's got my eyes. Hasn't
he got my eyes?

42:53.140 --> 42:56.620
- You've got your mum's nose.
Although that's no blessing.
- Oi!

42:59.140 --> 43:01.810
I've brought you a photograph of him.

43:03.660 --> 43:06.740
There's a girl at work who
likes me. She's asked me out.

43:07.740 --> 43:10.770
- Do you like her?
- She's a bit daft.

43:10.820 --> 43:13.020
And she's got these teeth.

43:13.860 --> 43:18.810
I mean, she's not you. But
I can't have you, can I?

43:18.860 --> 43:21.200
- Billy.
- I need you to say it.

43:22.220 --> 43:24.220
Go out with your girl.

43:27.220 --> 43:29.220
Teeth it is, then.

43:33.180 --> 43:35.180
See you soon.

43:47.060 --> 43:49.060
Billy!

43:54.940 --> 43:56.940
Doris!

44:00.420 --> 44:03.980
Doris? Doris, can you hear me?

44:11.420 --> 44:14.330
I want you to read your own
sentences when I come back.

44:14.380 --> 44:17.180
A sentence each from
the next chapter.

44:20.900 --> 44:22.900
Miss Mardle.

44:27.340 --> 44:29.340
Josie, what is it?

44:47.780 --> 44:50.250
What was she doing, running
across the road?

44:50.300 --> 44:52.250
You started this, Miss Mardle.

44:52.300 --> 44:54.570
It's up to you to finish it.

44:54.620 --> 44:59.130
Tell me to mind my own business but
you appear to be carrying the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

44:59.180 --> 45:01.770
I have some friends
who I'd like welcomed.

45:01.820 --> 45:03.570
They'll be in and
out as they see fit.

45:03.620 --> 45:04.770
Evening, gents.

45:04.820 --> 45:07.850
After the wake, my first
thought was to see you.

45:07.900 --> 45:10.250
You're too involved. It
could ruin everything.

45:10.300 --> 45:12.860
- Any questions? No?
- I have one.
