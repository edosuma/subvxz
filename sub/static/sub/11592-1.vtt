00:58.475 --> 01:01.255
You sure you want to stay
on the other side of the wall.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.205
They begin demolition on it
next Monday.

01:04.425 --> 01:07.270
By the end of this month they'll be
opening a police station and schools.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.155
What's with the long face
you don't seem too happy.

01:10.423 --> 01:13.118
I just hope they keep their promises.

01:13.153 --> 01:16.266
Listen, it's the law and the law
is always looking to some fool like me...

01:16.301 --> 01:18.945
...to make sure these matters are
handled

01:21.522 --> 01:24.446
Three years later,
the government has changed.

01:25.319 --> 01:27.456
...but nothing else has...

01:39.342 --> 01:43.163
Sector 13 Ultimatum

04:19.420 --> 04:21.034
Halt!

04:36.264 --> 04:38.227
Stop!

04:57.228 --> 05:00.021
¡Follow! ¡Follow!

05:11.281 --> 05:14.075
There he is!

05:48.257 --> 05:49.410
What's going on?

05:49.445 --> 05:51.557
Over here.

05:58.175 --> 06:01.030
Hey, man. Now you bringing cops?

06:01.277 --> 06:02.840
Sorry.

06:03.993 --> 06:06.428
think you're a Musketeer
or something?

06:06.647 --> 06:08.679
- Yes, I'm Dartagnan.
- You mocking me?

06:08.714 --> 06:10.379
Dudú, leave it alone.

06:11.254 --> 06:13.909
Dudú, you're a bit dense.
You should have stayed in school.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.092
- Say, you look like a kid.
- I am a kid.

06:20.359 --> 06:23.108
You, take care of the others.
You come with me.

06:41.219 --> 06:43.997
Have a seat.
What did you do now?

06:45.026 --> 06:47.926
- This city is not a hotel.
- I'm sorry.

06:47.961 --> 06:51.088
- I'm tired of it.
- This isn't the same situation

06:52.061 --> 06:54.949
You're free, you have the whole
city to yourself.

06:56.231 --> 06:58.207
They treat us like beasts.

06:58.242 --> 07:00.149
It's like this from birth.

07:00.184 --> 07:02.149
For three years they've been telling
us the same thing.

07:02.184 --> 07:05.654
A government that doesn't keep it's
promises? Wow, that's rare.

07:07.963 --> 07:10.125
If we do not do something,
they'll just keep ignoring us.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.858
They keep us trapped here like animals in cages.

07:16.829 --> 07:20.050
This isn't your culture dude.
This wall protects us...

07:20.085 --> 07:22.242
...like a fortress.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.102
And those that come
with talk of society, are no matter to us.

07:26.137 --> 07:28.055
We have our own.

07:28.090 --> 07:30.077
And we like it that way.

07:30.112 --> 07:33.048
And frankly, I prefer to be the king
of a small kingdom...

07:33.083 --> 07:35.137
...Than some nobody out there.

07:35.172 --> 07:37.639
So be cool and stop bringing the cops
to our wall...

07:37.674 --> 07:40.107
...if not, I'll be forced to take
action against you.

07:40.142 --> 07:42.076
Understand me?

07:43.199 --> 07:44.979
This is the merchandise.

07:59.238 --> 08:02.153
Takes this.
It's a gift.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.849
Yes, boss?

08:13.112 --> 08:14.677
Yes, boss.

08:15.330 --> 08:16.580
Go in.

08:22.048 --> 08:24.213
Leave it!

09:03.296 --> 09:05.113
Let's go!

09:06.169 --> 09:08.357
Let's go!

10:08.048 --> 10:10.942
Your merchandise has arrived.
Should I go get the first client?

10:10.977 --> 10:13.917
Don't be rude, let me enjoy myself
a while.

10:13.952 --> 10:16.702
Get them all out, except that one.

10:20.028 --> 10:22.077
Everyone out!

10:22.303 --> 10:23.599
Not you.

10:25.026 --> 10:27.679
Go see the boss.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.361
C'mon dance a bit.

10:44.801 --> 10:46.797
Mr. Ou will see you in a moment.

10:46.832 --> 10:49.221
Tell him my ass is falling asleep
from having to wait so long.

10:49.256 --> 10:51.098
You can tell him yourself, sir.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.674
C'mon get on your knees.

10:55.987 --> 10:58.730
If you want to win more,
you have to lean more.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.858
Get on your knees man.
Hands on top of your head.

11:05.893 --> 11:08.246
- You're a thief?
- Worse.

11:08.281 --> 11:08.786
Police.

11:09.053 --> 11:10.580
You're under arrest, you have
the right to maintain your silence...

11:10.615 --> 11:12.863
...Until present in front of the judge...

11:13.319 --> 11:14.608
If you think I'm going to...

11:14.819 --> 11:17.184
In French this means - shut up.

11:28.913 --> 11:31.783
No! it's a vase from the Ming
dynasty.

11:32.838 --> 11:35.782
DoN'T	 worry, it's a fake.

11:37.858 --> 11:40.379
And the rest?
They're all fake?

11:40.924 --> 11:42.393
Almost. Except for the Van Gogh.

11:46.041 --> 11:50.826
Head office, I have the soap.
I repeat, I have the soap.

11:51.054 --> 11:52.894
Understood.
Transmitting location.

11:54.943 --> 11:58.974
- I am the soap?
- More like a shampoo.

11:59.926 --> 12:02.951
- Bait is more like it.
- What do you mean bait?

12:02.986 --> 12:05.845
Don't worry.
You don't have to understand.

12:13.918 --> 12:16.787
Everything's calm.
Sanitary control.

12:17.802 --> 12:20.645
We'd like to see the boss.

12:28.901 --> 12:30.991
Sir, there is a police unit
at the door.

12:31.026 --> 12:33.337
Two police and I'm sure
there are more hidden.

12:33.950 --> 12:35.881
You're right there. Go.

12:39.955 --> 12:41.458
Go.

12:44.951 --> 12:47.854
- Asshole!
- See, they're already biting.

12:47.889 --> 12:50.529
You'll never get out, this building
is completely monitored.

12:50.564 --> 12:53.169
If it had been an easy assignment,
they wouldn't have sent me.

12:53.204 --> 12:54.710
¿What is this?

12:54.745 --> 12:56.841
It's simple, if you speak
your cheeks explode.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.878
Want to test?
Good.

12:58.913 --> 13:01.893
I'll be sure to say how cooperative you
were in my report.

13:02.159 --> 13:04.345
Central, I'm going fishing.

13:18.163 --> 13:20.892
Mr. Ou is expecting them.

13:28.988 --> 13:30.080
They stay.

13:30.115 --> 13:32.048
Remain here, it's cool.

13:36.857 --> 13:39.823
Mr. Ou, what a pleasure.

13:39.858 --> 13:42.789
Don't move.
Over there.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.871
Walk.

13:57.812 --> 14:00.400
After you, sirs.

14:04.723 --> 14:06.426
So I'm last or what?

14:06.816 --> 14:08.432
Them first.

14:16.766 --> 14:18.734
- Hugo.
- You Know me?

14:18.769 --> 14:20.920
Yes, I have photos of you all over my rooms.

14:20.955 --> 14:22.374
Shit!

14:22.409 --> 14:23.759
Go.

14:23.794 --> 14:25.927
Raise your head.

14:26.917 --> 14:29.846
- What is this?
- You should know, you invented it.

14:34.767 --> 14:36.700
Sirs, follow me.

14:41.811 --> 14:43.883
He's fucking with me.

14:44.103 --> 14:46.415
Leave it alone, it's cool.

14:46.808 --> 14:49.163
Its been a week... this fat...

14:49.803 --> 14:53.626
Calm down.
Drink a margarita, it'll relax you.

14:57.875 --> 15:00.329
To hell with your margarita!

15:00.903 --> 15:02.865
I'm sick of these guys.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.572
C'mon, he's beginning to get antsy.

15:13.808 --> 15:16.516
Mr Sam, fair went to look for it.

15:20.048 --> 15:22.812
This is how you treat
your best client?

15:22.847 --> 15:25.387
Since when do I come last.

15:25.637 --> 15:27.146
We always leave the shit for last.

15:27.181 --> 15:28.894
Hands up.

15:33.912 --> 15:35.615
What are you doing?

15:37.926 --> 15:39.974
This fucker's crazy.

15:43.799 --> 15:45.857
What's this shit?

15:45.892 --> 15:47.688
It doesn't do anything to you?

15:49.792 --> 15:52.236
I'm immune asshole.

15:52.271 --> 15:54.680
Well, we'll fix that.

16:03.865 --> 16:06.750
It's nothing, a vase fell,
that's all.

16:10.904 --> 16:13.590
Central, fishing expedition finished.
Send in the boys.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.357
Already did.

16:20.791 --> 16:23.601
- Nobody move!
- Everyone face down, now!

16:25.944 --> 16:27.987
Hands on your head!

16:28.022 --> 16:30.031
- Go, go!
- Move in!

16:37.633 --> 16:39.530
Go!

16:56.667 --> 16:58.888
You'll never get out alive,
disgusting policeman.

16:59.108 --> 17:00.763
You have no chance!

17:01.163 --> 17:02.554
You're sure?

17:02.913 --> 17:04.679
Let me go! Let me go!

17:09.989 --> 17:12.936
- I'm assuming you're not going to give me the code.
- Go to hell!

17:12.972 --> 17:15.124
Doesn't matter, I have a key.

17:37.764 --> 17:39.422
Drive!!

17:47.866 --> 17:49.612
- Sending them down now.

17:49.647 --> 17:51.366
Send in the rest of the unit.

17:54.744 --> 17:56.476
Careful with the feet!

18:12.038 --> 18:13.629
Move!

18:14.848 --> 18:16.529
Let him go!

18:16.564 --> 18:19.251
Get out! Shit, get out!

18:21.689 --> 18:23.418
Found it!

18:25.686 --> 18:28.681
I told them there were traps.

18:39.569 --> 18:42.483
What happened?
I'll kill you.

18:46.591 --> 18:48.140
Open up!

19:06.840 --> 19:08.531
Shit.

19:15.856 --> 19:18.491
- You ok?
- Yeah, I'll be right with you.

19:21.832 --> 19:23.411
Don't move.

19:25.601 --> 19:28.435
This painting is worth
200 million euros.

19:28.779 --> 19:30.354
Its a Van Gogh.

19:30.389 --> 19:33.669
One stray bullet, one scratch,
and it's worthless.

21:33.456 --> 21:35.081
Die motherfucker!

21:44.708 --> 21:46.842
There he is, shoot that fucker!

22:14.599 --> 22:17.036
Ok I see the keypad.

22:21.540 --> 22:23.202
And you guys are...?

22:24.597 --> 22:26.952
Lovely to meet you.

22:34.537 --> 22:36.756
Head office, there is a bomb.

22:37.464 --> 22:39.660
- A bomb?
- Any ideas?

22:53.592 --> 22:56.355
- Where is it exactly?
- In the basement kitchen.

22:56.568 --> 22:59.293
Ok,
we'll send you the necessary.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.165
Careful!

23:17.586 --> 23:19.400
It's on it's way.

23:19.634 --> 23:21.067
Fantastic!

24:04.445 --> 24:07.223
Lovely to see you guys.
Come on in.

24:16.265 --> 24:18.461
- Any injuries?
- No, I think it's ok.

24:18.496 --> 24:21.324
- I was reffering to you Damian.
- I'm fine commander, thanks.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.437
These guys aren't the only ones.

24:23.472 --> 24:25.480
Go rest,
file the report tomorrow.

24:25.515 --> 24:28.304
I prefer to keep working while
it's fresh in my head.

24:28.339 --> 24:30.518
Tomorrow I'll go in early
if it's no problem.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.393
No, I'll see you in my office
at noon. It's an order.

24:34.282 --> 24:35.314
Thanks.

24:41.276 --> 24:43.079
- Good Work.
- Thanks.

25:18.288 --> 25:19.907
Everything ok?

25:23.263 --> 25:25.168
All clear.

25:25.203 --> 25:27.074
Send him in.

25:35.536 --> 25:37.120
Sirs.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.216
- What do you think of this site?
- Glorious.

25:53.356 --> 25:55.996
How long does it take to erect a tower like this?

25:56.398 --> 25:59.085
It depends on the start date.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.550
But more or less,
eight years.

26:04.207 --> 26:05.423
OK.

26:06.379 --> 26:07.638
Yes.

26:08.375 --> 26:09.953
Bring it out.

26:18.308 --> 26:20.427
Just like Chantier...

26:20.462 --> 26:23.504
...double, if they give us
the guarantee that they will build it.

26:23.539 --> 26:25.488
The operation will begin
tonight.

26:25.523 --> 26:27.047
Perfect.

26:48.381 --> 26:51.285
- Thanks, have a good night.
- Good night, Damián.

26:56.307 --> 26:57.696
Shit.

27:31.723 --> 27:33.093
Damián?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.322
Forgot about me?

27:43.762 --> 27:44.809
No.

27:45.460 --> 27:47.882
Just wanted to let you sleep

27:49.304 --> 27:52.864
I've been sleeping for eight hours, I'm well rested.

27:54.335 --> 27:57.097
Wait, wait.
Take it easy, easy.

27:57.132 --> 27:59.331
My body hurts all over.

27:59.366 --> 28:01.685
All over?

28:04.183 --> 28:05.887
Almost.

28:06.104 --> 28:08.054
Is this make-up?

28:08.304 --> 28:10.490
Yes, for work.

28:11.238 --> 28:12.519
For work?

28:12.554 --> 28:15.393
You told me you spend all day
chasing paintings.

28:15.428 --> 28:17.578
Its my job.

28:18.140 --> 28:21.128
Well, you better show me that you were
worth the wait.

28:23.293 --> 28:25.229
Yes ma'am.

28:32.368 --> 28:35.219
Suspect is on Seventh street.

28:36.379 --> 28:38.490
Great music.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.767
Excuse me.

28:50.332 --> 28:52.317
Repeat, blue car...

28:53.208 --> 28:55.330
54, I'm near.

28:55.365 --> 28:57.452
Copy that, 54.

29:03.358 --> 29:05.371
So, Salim,
is it true?

29:05.406 --> 29:07.910
- Yes, yes!
- Listen!

29:07.945 --> 29:10.379
Yes, hello.
Are you home?

29:10.414 --> 29:13.443
No, I am in a palace
with a view of the Eiffel Tower.

29:15.098 --> 29:19.127
- And where is your palace?
- Eliesos Fields.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.354
Nice neighborhood.

29:22.389 --> 29:25.155
Well, we can hear you,
would you like to dedicate it to someone.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.149
Yes, to Sofia.

29:27.184 --> 29:30.962
Well, "Push the Air",
is for her.

29:32.149 --> 29:34.946
Well, you know...

29:43.220 --> 29:45.099
- No!
- Shit!

29:48.058 --> 29:50.152
What's going on?

29:51.219 --> 29:53.819
It'll be ok.

29:56.145 --> 29:58.162
- Samir.
- What?

29:58.197 --> 30:00.117
The police.

30:05.065 --> 30:07.419
- Turn down the music.
- It's just music.

30:08.090 --> 30:10.214
- We're not doing anything wrong.
- I'll decide that.

30:10.249 --> 30:12.215
Your papers, both of you, now.

30:12.250 --> 30:14.429
- Here.
- Take it.

30:17.042 --> 30:19.070
- Who's car is this?
- My dad's.

30:19.105 --> 30:20.790
Drivers license?

30:21.208 --> 30:23.037
Don't have it, I took his car.

30:23.072 --> 30:24.250
¿And your licence?

30:24.285 --> 30:26.035
I'm 17, I don't have a license!

30:26.070 --> 30:28.097
We're not doing anything except
listening to music.

30:28.132 --> 30:30.153
Since when is it a crime to listen to music?

30:30.188 --> 30:31.998
We're not bothering anyone.

30:32.033 --> 30:34.009
- C'mon get out of the car.
- No.

30:34.044 --> 30:35.620
Hurry up.

30:51.138 --> 30:53.557
Shit! Again.

30:54.198 --> 30:56.389
Go see what happened.

30:57.602 --> 30:59.841
OK.

31:05.195 --> 31:07.848
- What the hell is this?
- Don't know.

31:08.190 --> 31:10.175
Start filming.

31:35.032 --> 31:38.038
- What's happening here officer?
- Routine stop.

31:38.073 --> 31:40.689
Girls listening to music in a car aren't dangerous.

31:40.724 --> 31:43.305
Why not search the car? These girls transport...

31:43.340 --> 31:45.132
...drugs in this neighbourhood.

31:45.167 --> 31:47.977
We'll give them the benefit of the
doubt tonite.

31:48.012 --> 31:49.922
- Know how to drive?
- Yes.

31:49.957 --> 31:51.395
- Then leave.
- But I don't have a licence.

31:51.430 --> 31:52.925
Leave!

31:58.984 --> 32:01.151
Shit, he let them go.
She doesn't even have a license.

32:01.870 --> 32:03.242
What do we do?
Follow them?

32:03.277 --> 32:04.958
- No no.
- Wait.

32:04.993 --> 32:06.421
- Keep filming.
- That's what I'm dong

32:06.456 --> 32:09.132
Which unit are you with exactly?

32:09.167 --> 32:11.141
Secret Service.

32:11.176 --> 32:13.661
Let's talk in the car.

32:24.086 --> 32:25.191
Shit!

32:25.226 --> 32:27.034
Don't you move, keep filming.

32:27.069 --> 32:29.778
- And what's this?
- Keep filming.

32:37.095 --> 32:39.465
And what's this?

32:41.068 --> 32:44.123
Zoom in on the plates, zoom in.

32:44.158 --> 32:45.993
Already did it.

32:46.028 --> 32:48.180
Shit, I've never
seen anything like this.

32:48.215 --> 32:50.682
Give it here, I'll do it.

32:52.010 --> 32:53.173
- Samir.
- What?

32:53.208 --> 32:56.191
Police that murder
police, that's a fucking bomb.

32:56.851 --> 33:01.012
Precisely, before seeing it explode,
we'll wait to hear the official version.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.964
We'll do that.

33:37.099 --> 33:38.685
What?

33:38.720 --> 33:41.438
- A police cruiser here?
- What the fuck?

33:41.473 --> 33:43.641
They crazy?

33:44.077 --> 33:45.794
What are they doing?

33:46.070 --> 33:48.686
Something bad, you can be sure of it.

33:48.889 --> 33:50.983
Yo, are you lost?

33:51.018 --> 33:53.977
- This ain't a parking lot.
- Damm right.

33:57.052 --> 33:59.807
- Have them framed?
- Proceed.

34:00.102 --> 34:01.822
Perfect.

34:04.064 --> 34:05.702
They're firing!

34:05.998 --> 34:07.453
Shoot!

34:12.155 --> 34:15.167
C'mon you idiots...

34:17.974 --> 34:20.851
- The clock is synchronized?
- Affirmative.

34:20.886 --> 34:23.706
We got what we needed, let's go.

34:32.156 --> 34:33.964
Diss.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.206
Where you going?

35:11.937 --> 35:14.953
Keep sleeping, I'm gonna catch a movie.

35:28.019 --> 35:29.869
Get down, lie flat on the ground, hands up!!!

35:29.904 --> 35:32.142
- Police!
- On the ground now!!!!

35:33.266 --> 35:34.954
Damián!

35:34.989 --> 35:37.262
What's happening?

35:37.971 --> 35:40.936
¿Who is the commander of
this unit? I want to speak to him.

35:41.951 --> 35:43.654
I am.

35:45.854 --> 35:48.003
I think you've got the wrong person.

35:48.038 --> 35:51.960
Damián Tomaso, Captain of Special Forces. 31 years old.

35:56.034 --> 35:58.925
What's the meaning of this?

35:58.960 --> 36:01.857
Captain, we found
this in the kitchen.

36:02.872 --> 36:06.057
Well, here's your reason, c'mon gather some things...

36:06.092 --> 36:08.367
...you're coming with us.

36:27.041 --> 36:29.009
This is bullshit.

36:30.009 --> 36:31.877
Georges, explain.

36:31.912 --> 36:34.818
For six monthsyou've promised us results.

36:35.838 --> 36:38.865
Mr President, we don't have the means to search each block
and sector.

36:38.900 --> 36:41.656
Save your excuses, please.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.858
There was a
contingency plan.

36:44.893 --> 36:47.750
So something must have improved.

36:48.057 --> 36:50.890
Explain to me, how it could get to this?

36:51.857 --> 36:54.790
I assure you this isn't a normal case.

36:55.899 --> 36:58.810
- What is it then?
- Well it's...

36:58.845 --> 37:01.721
...an isolated incident, nothing more.

37:01.973 --> 37:03.547
I hope you'e right.

37:03.858 --> 37:06.950
In the meantime put someone on the case.
Someone serious and effective.

37:07.701 --> 37:09.927
This Tomaso, for example.

37:09.962 --> 37:11.820
Is this a typical case for him?

37:11.855 --> 37:14.866
Thought about him, but he was arrested
for drug trafficking this morning.

37:15.911 --> 37:17.899
Tomaso? You sure?

37:17.934 --> 37:19.689
Lamentably.

37:21.881 --> 37:24.125
I was about to promote him...

37:24.897 --> 37:27.924
I also had Gazmán in mind, the boss of Diss.
They are well informed on this sector.

37:29.910 --> 37:32.551
Yes, very well. Very Well.

37:46.990 --> 37:49.145
Mr President.

37:49.180 --> 37:51.300
What? Already?

37:51.897 --> 37:54.066
I guess they are aware of the
situation.

37:54.101 --> 37:56.974
I've been briefed Mr. President.

37:57.009 --> 37:57.888
Very well.

37:57.923 --> 38:00.826
If that film is leaked, we could
lose all credibility.

38:00.861 --> 38:03.775
Put a civilian car in it's place.

38:04.947 --> 38:07.542
We have 48 hours.

38:08.724 --> 38:11.784
That's exactly how long you have to solve this case.

38:11.819 --> 38:13.378
- Use the utmost discretion.
- Yes, sir.

38:13.413 --> 38:15.595
Will do, Mr President.

38:25.964 --> 38:29.993
He doesn't realize war has never been
at odds with democracy.

38:32.099 --> 38:34.958
Special Report:
Last night in sector 13...

38:35.643 --> 38:38.749
...An altercation between a band of thugs
and the forces of order...

39:01.784 --> 39:04.656
- Damm!
- Looks, it's an internal camera.

39:08.784 --> 39:11.901
This is shit!
This was not for fun!

39:15.820 --> 39:17.858
yeah?
and why are you here?

39:17.893 --> 39:19.862
I was in the wrong place

39:19.897 --> 39:22.767
It's no reason for them to lock me up.

39:23.859 --> 39:26.379
You did good, now get out!

39:27.891 --> 39:29.826
I have rights!

39:41.067 --> 39:44.866
Go, see to your friends and tell them to watch their
backs.

39:53.905 --> 39:55.339
Let's go!

39:56.673 --> 39:58.915
- Which sector?
- 13.

39:59.433 --> 40:00.628
Perfect.

40:00.663 --> 40:03.272
Boss, can I show you something?

40:06.893 --> 40:09.170
They Sent us this.

40:15.905 --> 40:18.805
It's the camera that
transmitted yesterday.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.912
But look at this.

40:25.715 --> 40:28.723
Probably some boys intent on looking for
girls.

40:30.746 --> 40:33.929
When I saw them,
I zoomed in...

40:36.562 --> 40:39.388
...And saw this.

40:40.580 --> 40:43.274
Shit, they filmed it.

40:43.309 --> 40:43.722
Yes.

40:43.757 --> 40:46.814
Find this license plate number immediately.

40:46.849 --> 40:48.129
- I'm on it.
- Perfect.

41:04.784 --> 41:06.577
Letto, they're looking for me.

41:07.782 --> 41:10.895
- I Filmed it all and now they're looking for me.
- What are you talking about?

41:10.930 --> 41:12.862
About the car of the television.

41:12.897 --> 41:14.702
Shit!

41:15.982 --> 41:17.650
Here!

41:21.605 --> 41:22.827
Halt!

41:42.551 --> 41:44.717
- That is Samir.
- Halt!

41:44.752 --> 41:46.884
Let him go, let'em go!

41:47.732 --> 41:48.994
Let him go!

41:49.204 --> 41:51.616
Cal down, or we'll take you too.

41:52.682 --> 41:54.423
Let him go!

42:06.606 --> 42:08.633
Open door 14.

42:10.728 --> 42:12.277
Go.

42:13.716 --> 42:16.627
- Can you loan me a cellular?
- What mor do you want?

42:22.613 --> 42:24.577
My cellular.

42:27.807 --> 42:29.143
Thanks.

42:33.057 --> 42:35.089
C'mon, answer.

42:35.551 --> 42:38.677
Letto, it's Damian, I'm fucked dude,
I could really use a hand...

42:39.709 --> 42:41.570
I'm not home right now...

42:41.792 --> 42:44.048
...Or maybe you don't have the balls
to say it in my face...

42:44.264 --> 42:45.401
...so leave a message.

42:45.436 --> 42:47.700
You have to help me Letto,
it's Damian.

42:48.419 --> 42:51.384
Im in the basement of the central police station.

42:51.666 --> 42:53.201
I've been framed.

42:53.543 --> 42:55.559
I Need to get out of here.

42:56.320 --> 42:58.556
I know I can count on you.

43:01.633 --> 43:04.286
Let go of the telephone!

43:14.993 --> 43:16.871
What's good guys?

43:19.495 --> 43:22.201
The police are everywhere, you crazy?

43:22.236 --> 43:23.611
Yes, I know.

43:23.646 --> 43:25.161
everywhere.

43:25.196 --> 43:26.676
Got you.

43:33.722 --> 43:35.607
Be out in a minute.

43:39.874 --> 43:40.999
Yes?

43:41.351 --> 43:43.224
He called someone and explained the situation.

43:43.506 --> 43:46.691
- Who'd he call.
- Some guy called Letto.

43:46.903 --> 43:48.280
We traced it to sector 13.

43:48.315 --> 43:50.784
- They know each other
- Yes, they're close.

43:51.658 --> 43:54.312
Bring me this Letto,
We shouldn't risk it.

44:32.603 --> 44:34.647
You have a new message.

44:36.204 --> 44:41.669
Letto, I've been calling you
but you're never there. Well, ciao.

44:58.797 --> 45:00.598
Don't move!

45:09.532 --> 45:12.929
- You can't pass.
- Think it over.

45:13.849 --> 45:16.008
Good decision.

45:19.501 --> 45:21.178
Let's talk seriously.

45:21.489 --> 45:24.125
Someone has to die.
And it's you.

45:27.457 --> 45:29.556
Up!. Up!

45:36.335 --> 45:39.377
Shit, they left.
But she does not have a licence.

45:39.412 --> 45:41.516
- what do we do?
- Should we follow?

45:41.551 --> 45:43.157
- Go, go.
- No, stay.

45:43.192 --> 45:45.899
- Keep filming.
- That's what I'm doing.

45:45.934 --> 45:48.607
- What are you filming?
- Keep recording.

45:52.357 --> 45:53.582
Shit!

45:53.617 --> 45:55.558

45:55.593 --> 45:58.349
- And what is this?
- Keep flming.

45:58.555 --> 46:00.533
And what is this?

46:00.568 --> 46:03.378
The plates, zoom in on the plates.

46:03.413 --> 46:04.841
Already doing it.

46:04.876 --> 46:07.593
Shit, I've never seen anything like this.

46:19.491 --> 46:20.724
Go, go.

46:31.517 --> 46:35.029
Letto, it's Damian, I'm fucked,
I could really use a hand

46:35.468 --> 46:38.791
I'm in the basement of the central police station.

46:39.309 --> 46:41.320
Somebody framed me.

46:41.529 --> 46:43.462
I Need to get out of here.

46:43.497 --> 46:45.395
I know I can count on you.

46:57.433 --> 47:00.398
Letto, it's Damian, I'm fucked,
I could really use a hand

47:00.433 --> 47:03.481
I'm in the basement of the central police station.

47:15.502 --> 47:17.355
Somebody framed me.

47:42.431 --> 47:44.401
I Need to get out of here.

47:44.637 --> 47:47.525
I know I can count on you.

48:22.373 --> 48:25.371
What are you doing here?
Hurry up!

48:30.462 --> 48:33.396
He just dissappeared.
We'll look for him.

48:54.370 --> 48:56.026
Hurry! Hurry!

49:20.695 --> 49:22.517
This way!

49:41.409 --> 49:42.846
There he goes!

50:01.821 --> 50:04.008
Go the other way!

50:38.326 --> 50:40.057
Wait! Wait!

50:40.294 --> 50:44.214
Go! Go!

51:02.346 --> 51:05.412
Go, shit! THere he is!
Quickly!

51:12.319 --> 51:14.023
Shit!

51:17.344 --> 51:19.234
You were shopping?

51:19.269 --> 51:21.435
- No, sir.
- So you're incapable of trapping...

51:21.470 --> 51:23.178
...one boy with three units?

51:23.213 --> 51:25.295
The individual is very skillful, sir,
never seen anything like him.

51:25.330 --> 51:27.679
Next time ask him for lessons.

51:28.012 --> 51:30.457
Return to base, I will go
see the President.

51:30.492 --> 51:31.317
Yes, sir.

51:31.352 --> 51:32.764
And ow are things out there.

51:32.799 --> 51:34.789
They're aren't going to take long
to escalate.

51:49.227 --> 51:52.673
We didn't kill him on purpose,
I swear.

51:52.708 --> 51:56.120
He tried to leave... what can you do?

51:57.251 --> 51:59.501
Explain it to his mother.

52:01.219 --> 52:03.061
Move!

52:14.179 --> 52:16.177
Front and center!

52:18.361 --> 52:20.770
Let's go!

52:46.499 --> 52:48.121
Can I help you?

52:48.367 --> 52:50.713
Can I see the boss please?

52:51.761 --> 52:54.213
Boss, there is a youngster out here who
wants to see you?

52:54.248 --> 52:56.772
- Send him in.
- C'mon.

52:59.958 --> 53:02.551
- What's this about?
- Is for a room, please.

53:03.299 --> 53:05.141
Are you joking?
This is not a hotel.

53:05.609 --> 53:07.867
Outside it says
"police hotel. "

53:07.902 --> 53:10.125
Get out before you piss me off.

53:10.160 --> 53:11.743
Get the hell out!!

53:11.778 --> 53:14.480
Listen, it'sbetter for everyone
if you lock me up, I'm a criminal...

53:14.515 --> 53:18.529
...of some potential and I might
do something stupid.

53:18.564 --> 53:20.901
Have you commited some crime?

53:20.936 --> 53:22.093
No.

53:22.128 --> 53:25.314
Then you know what?
Come back when you have.

53:25.349 --> 53:28.034
We'll give you a nice clean cell, ok?

53:28.069 --> 53:29.437
Ok.

53:30.452 --> 53:32.646
Get on the ground, on the ground!

53:32.681 --> 53:34.841
Don't move you!
Do not move!

53:36.089 --> 53:37.964
Open door 14.

53:40.949 --> 53:43.352
You're in luck, only cell we had left.

53:43.387 --> 53:46.321
- But there is no cover or food.
- What is there?

53:46.924 --> 53:48.518
What were you expecting?

53:56.168 --> 53:58.040
Let him go.

53:58.289 --> 54:00.212
I said let him go!

54:09.485 --> 54:11.549
Security.

54:11.989 --> 54:13.998
Security, the doors
are blocked off.

54:20.528 --> 54:22.695
You sure took yur time.

54:23.250 --> 54:26.053
Want me to come back when you're
in a better mood?

54:26.088 --> 54:27.794
No, no thanks.

54:28.802 --> 54:31.143
- I'm glad to see you man.
- Me too.

54:32.143 --> 54:34.177
Everything is going to shit out there,
you sure you want out?

54:34.212 --> 54:36.156
Yes, I have scores to settle.

54:36.191 --> 54:37.579
Let's get outta here.
You got a plan?

54:37.614 --> 54:39.227
Why don't you have a plan?

54:39.262 --> 54:42.188
I thought since you got in here so easily,
that you'd have a plan.

54:44.591 --> 54:46.185
Getting in wasn't so difficult.

54:47.163 --> 54:49.973
It's getting out that's going to
pose a little bit of a problem.

54:58.781 --> 55:00.365
You're well trained

55:00.400 --> 55:01.915
Yes, more or less.

55:01.950 --> 55:04.244
C'mo I know a shortcut.

55:11.382 --> 55:13.523
This is your shortcut?

55:25.355 --> 55:27.932
Run! Run!

55:41.406 --> 55:43.344
Tomaso escaped from his cell.

55:43.379 --> 55:45.284
He's gone already?

55:45.319 --> 55:47.190
No, he's still inside.

55:47.651 --> 55:50.072
- Find him.
- Yes sir.

55:50.107 --> 55:51.476
And fast.

55:51.511 --> 55:54.087
...In sector 13...

55:54.122 --> 55:56.159
Sirs.

55:56.194 --> 55:58.163
It's begun?

55:58.603 --> 56:00.234
...Of law enforcement...

56:00.269 --> 56:03.063
...And the incidents
have multiplied.

56:04.226 --> 56:07.111
Among the injured are numerous officials.

56:09.167 --> 56:12.102
Well, commander,
how's it coming?

56:12.137 --> 56:14.740
Sector 13
is out of control.

56:14.775 --> 56:18.022
And there is a risk that the surrounding sectors
may join them.

56:18.057 --> 56:21.214
The whole country could be
on high alert in 24 hours.

56:21.587 --> 56:26.092
General do you still advise a military
intervention as a preventive measure?

56:26.127 --> 56:28.087
Yes. But the army...

56:28.122 --> 56:31.028
...doesn't have the time to
prepare for an internal invasion.

56:31.797 --> 56:35.072
Lamentably, time is a luxury
we don't have.

56:38.131 --> 56:40.990
Mr Gazmán - your recommendation?

56:41.919 --> 56:44.129
When gangrene spreads, the area must
be cut off.

56:44.164 --> 56:50.130
Well, I wasn't elected due to my tolerance
for metaphors.

56:50.517 --> 56:53.065
When I ask for a recommendation,
I expect one.

56:53.100 --> 56:55.184
Well, Mr President,
I'll be more direct

56:55.219 --> 56:58.027
Evacuate the entire sector 13
in twelve hours.

56:58.062 --> 57:01.740
Tommorrow morning, we'll demolish the sector
entirely, and no one will be able to return there.

57:02.099 --> 57:04.158
And there are other advantages.

57:04.193 --> 57:05.998
This will create new jobs.

57:06.033 --> 57:08.486
We'll build a new neghborhood
full of bourgeois...

57:08.521 --> 57:11.063
...That will probably vote for
you in the next elections.

57:13.176 --> 57:15.840
It could not be more clear.

57:16.248 --> 57:17.621
Sirs.

57:18.496 --> 57:20.275
Any thoughts?

57:20.556 --> 57:23.866
Politically, this solution
would be extremely dangerous.

57:24.145 --> 57:26.457
What's your solution?

57:31.800 --> 57:33.218
Well...

57:33.920 --> 57:37.324
I notice that none of you have
any specific proposal...

57:37.359 --> 57:39.325
...to defend
our democracy.

57:39.360 --> 57:40.590
Very interesting.

57:40.625 --> 57:43.257
Remember that our primary function
is to protect the French people...

57:43.292 --> 57:44.881
...And look after their interests.

57:44.916 --> 57:48.114
And to ensure that the values of
freedom, equality, and brotherhood...

57:48.149 --> 57:51.812
...are still respected
in this country.

57:51.847 --> 57:55.857
That is, how should I say?
The entire foundation of our republic.

57:56.343 --> 58:00.276
And the only proposition you bring to
me, is to demolish the place? Disgusting.

58:01.092 --> 58:02.117
Thank you.

58:02.152 --> 58:04.681
Mr President,
the idea is abhorrent...

58:04.716 --> 58:07.020
...But we have priorities.

58:07.055 --> 58:10.762
Perhaps in two hours
the situation will be uncontrollable.

58:10.797 --> 58:15.131
Perhaps it isn't the best idea...

58:15.848 --> 58:17.297
...but it is the lesser evil.

58:17.639 --> 58:19.171
General...

58:19.511 --> 58:22.597
...can we evacuate a million civiliaans
in twelve hours?

58:22.632 --> 58:24.787
If you give the order now,
it's possible.

58:24.822 --> 58:28.560
I suppose some clan bosses won't be
so easily evacuated.

58:28.934 --> 58:30.775
Who will miss them?

58:43.090 --> 58:44.715
General.

58:45.550 --> 58:47.759
Proceed with the evacuation.

58:47.794 --> 58:51.585
We'll begin planning tomorrow morning.

58:52.918 --> 58:57.572
Mr Gazmán, I trust that all
the inhabitants of this neighbourhood...

58:57.607 --> 59:00.890
will be treated with respect
and dignity, and I mean...

59:00.925 --> 59:02.389
...ALL.

59:02.613 --> 59:05.547
I'll give the order personally,
Mr President.

59:05.950 --> 59:07.282
Dismissed.

59:15.076 --> 59:16.720
Go that way!

59:18.967 --> 59:20.791
Keep looking!

59:30.624 --> 59:32.702
We're ok here.

59:35.155 --> 59:39.571
- They weren't Police?
- They Found drugs in my kitchen.

59:40.555 --> 59:42.881
Don't you know how to hide shit?

59:42.916 --> 59:45.208
Wasn't mine.
They planted it.

59:45.772 --> 59:46.945
classic.

59:46.980 --> 59:49.095
Police that want to fuck
other policemen.

59:49.130 --> 59:50.203
Its not common.

59:50.238 --> 59:52.298
Above all, I have to ask, why?

59:52.333 --> 59:53.692
To stop you from going anywhere.

59:53.727 --> 59:55.051
They know how social you are.

59:55.086 --> 59:56.031
I don't know.

59:56.066 --> 59:58.363
I'm sure it's something dirty that
they don't want you to stick your nose in.

59:58.626 --> 01:00:01.088
Super cops aren't good for everything.

01:00:01.123 --> 01:00:03.449
They would have given me vacation time
or promoted me somewhere else.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.228
Would you have taken a holiday.

01:00:06.765 --> 01:00:08.482
No, of course not.

01:00:13.779 --> 01:00:15.562
Do you know what's happening out there?

01:00:15.597 --> 01:00:17.007
What's happening?

01:00:17.042 --> 01:00:20.101
There is a recording that shows some
thugs riddling...

01:00:20.136 --> 01:00:21.475
...a patrol car with bullets.

01:00:22.597 --> 01:00:25.033
But there is another recording which
shows it was the cops...

01:00:25.068 --> 01:00:28.017
...who shot up that patrol car.

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:30.805
What was the patrol car
doing in sector 13?

01:00:31.076 --> 01:00:32.770
It may have been transported.

01:00:33.031 --> 01:00:33.953
And afterwards?

01:00:33.988 --> 01:00:37.526
After I got the second video,
part of the building exploded.

01:00:38.273 --> 01:00:40.931
It Was the police.

01:00:44.366 --> 01:00:45.691
But I managed to escape.

01:00:48.987 --> 01:00:50.794
they Are not police.

01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:53.294
They must be criminals passing
themselves off as cops.

01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:55.666
Why? For fun?

01:00:55.701 --> 01:00:58.170
It's a strategy to do away with
sector 13.

01:00:58.575 --> 01:01:00.416
And afterwards build on top of it.

01:01:06.761 --> 01:01:08.679
Remember the license plate?

01:01:10.896 --> 01:01:13.364
They All have the same
license plate:DISS.

01:01:16.068 --> 01:01:17.888
DISS, I don't believe it.

01:01:17.923 --> 01:01:19.450
What is it?

01:01:20.013 --> 01:01:22.734
Secret internal security division.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.351
Damn, that's it.

01:01:24.386 --> 01:01:28.086
They recieve their orders directly
from the President.

01:01:29.821 --> 01:01:32.033
The DISS boss is Gazmán Multer.

01:01:32.068 --> 01:01:34.959
- You know him?
- No, actually, no.

01:01:35.691 --> 01:01:38.856
They wanted to transfer me there
six months ago - I turned it down.

01:01:38.891 --> 01:01:42.021
Well there you go, you've got a
guilty party, motive, and a crime.

01:01:43.643 --> 01:01:46.518
Only thig missing is proof.

01:01:46.841 --> 01:01:48.805
What about this?

01:01:53.521 --> 01:01:56.049
That won't be sufficient.

01:01:56.674 --> 01:01:59.031
You need something that'll really
bother them.

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:07.513
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

01:02:07.823 --> 01:02:10.198
It scares me when you think alot.

01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:13.865
- We have to get to Walter's office.
- I was afraid of that.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.909
- Where is it?
- First floor, office 17.

01:02:19.272 --> 01:02:21.407
The old fahioned way?

01:02:21.442 --> 01:02:23.608
Fine, the old fashioned way.

01:02:44.986 --> 01:02:47.760
Can't you be discreet, like me?

01:02:47.795 --> 01:02:50.534
Being discreet doesn't matter here.

01:02:53.684 --> 01:02:55.507
Now what?

01:02:55.852 --> 01:02:57.773
I'm thinking.

01:02:57.808 --> 01:02:59.920
There they are!

01:02:59.955 --> 01:03:02.033
I don't like this.

01:03:28.984 --> 01:03:30.764
Any ideas?

01:03:31.672 --> 01:03:34.750
I'll entertain them, you
get to Walter's office

01:03:34.785 --> 01:03:36.835
Remember, first floor, office 17.

01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:38.885
Bring whatever proof you have.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:40.756
Will we see each other again?

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:44.384
I doubt I'll be going very far, go!

01:04:00.832 --> 01:04:02.486
Now you'll see!

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:43.740
If you stay put, and remain silent, nothing
will happen.

01:04:44.091 --> 01:04:45.591
You have my word, ok?

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.711
¿Which is Mr Garzo's computer?

01:04:53.318 --> 01:04:54.804
What's the pasword?

01:05:06.702 --> 01:05:08.760
Good morning, any of you
have a computer...

01:05:08.795 --> 01:05:10.011
...That moved by itself?

01:05:10.046 --> 01:05:11.537
Yes, me.

01:05:11.572 --> 01:05:14.774
Tech service, I'm here to install
the new server.

01:05:17.756 --> 01:05:19.756
Sorry for the inconvenience.

01:05:24.579 --> 01:05:26.145
Found it.

01:05:30.531 --> 01:05:32.344
Thank you sirs.

01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:11.780
Damián.

01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:16.713
Be reasonable and let justice handle
this problem.

01:06:21.183 --> 01:06:24.333
You know very well, I did nothing wrong.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.885
Yeah I know. prisons are full of
innocents.

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:33.142
However, the farms...

01:06:35.155 --> 01:06:36.949
Well, you ready?

01:06:53.625 --> 01:06:54.826
The things I do for you.

01:06:54.861 --> 01:06:56.312
Don't worry I'll pay up soon.

01:06:58.146 --> 01:06:59.658
Don't let them go!

01:07:03.631 --> 01:07:05.627
Shit!

01:07:06.559 --> 01:07:08.120
We can follow on foot, right?

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.774
Put on the belt.

01:07:30.626 --> 01:07:33.529
- What are you doing?
- Well, going ahead as planned.

01:07:50.777 --> 01:07:52.218
Excuse m.

01:07:56.588 --> 01:07:57.586
I'm Listening.

01:07:57.793 --> 01:07:59.585
- Damián escaped.
- How did he escape?

01:07:59.803 --> 01:08:01.473
Letto Came for him.

01:08:01.508 --> 01:08:03.458
He came for him and they escaped together.

01:08:03.493 --> 01:08:06.017
Explain to me how they escaped.

01:08:06.547 --> 01:08:08.392
He's going for your office.

01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:10.626
What should we do?
Pursue them?

01:08:10.661 --> 01:08:13.482
No, too dangeours, there are soldiers
everywhere.

01:08:13.517 --> 01:08:15.713
Stay attentive anyway.

01:08:15.748 --> 01:08:17.385
Understood.

01:08:24.598 --> 01:08:27.063
Follow the instructions that were given.

01:08:35.435 --> 01:08:37.652
And where will it take us?

01:09:08.536 --> 01:09:10.613
There's always a law dog somewhere
close, watching.

01:09:10.648 --> 01:09:12.917
Yes, it was you who promised me
things would change.

01:09:12.953 --> 01:09:15.188
That there would always be some fool
to enforce the law.

01:09:15.223 --> 01:09:17.719
Laws are not evil, the people who
enforce them are.

01:09:17.754 --> 01:09:20.215
Yeah, like religion. Speaking of which,
what's yours.

01:09:20.497 --> 01:09:23.555
They Baptized me when I was a boy,
but right now my only objective...

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:25.640
...At present
is the civil code.

01:09:25.675 --> 01:09:27.166
What?

01:09:27.201 --> 01:09:29.638
My only aim at present
is to enforce the civil code.

01:09:29.673 --> 01:09:31.606
You're worse than a mormon.

01:09:34.475 --> 01:09:36.751
Well should we go or stay so they can
hit us.

01:09:36.786 --> 01:09:38.318
Go.

01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:00.466
- What you want?
- To Speak with Tao.

01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:01.675
'Bout what?

01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:03.937
About the sector
and its inhabitants.

01:10:04.532 --> 01:10:07.299
Your kidding.
Business?

01:10:22.643 --> 01:10:24.516
Let them pass.

01:10:43.847 --> 01:10:45.271
What are you doing here?

01:10:47.434 --> 01:10:50.456
Stole them from a nationa security team.

01:10:50.491 --> 01:10:52.214
They're good.

01:10:54.213 --> 01:10:55.331
Well?

01:10:55.366 --> 01:10:58.606
We'll give them to you, on the condition that
you help us attain some things that are of interest to us.

01:10:59.335 --> 01:11:00.631
What's this?

01:11:00.666 --> 01:11:02.425
A bit of catechism.

01:11:03.345 --> 01:11:05.577
You've lived your whole life in sector 13.

01:11:05.612 --> 01:11:07.691
Where do you think you'll live
when they destroy it?

01:11:07.726 --> 01:11:09.893
We must avoid that.

01:11:14.466 --> 01:11:16.589
Aniel, take this out.

01:11:44.522 --> 01:11:46.299
Ok. It's open.

01:11:46.334 --> 01:11:48.470
- They'r everywhere.
- Everywhere.

01:11:48.505 --> 01:11:50.391
Where'd you learn that?

01:11:50.866 --> 01:11:52.584
In books of course.

01:11:54.521 --> 01:11:56.568
Go on, do it.

01:12:00.469 --> 01:12:02.777
This is interesting to me.

01:12:03.342 --> 01:12:06.266
- We're now over Iran.
- This also interesting to me.

01:12:06.485 --> 01:12:08.441
Here it is, sector 13.

01:12:08.476 --> 01:12:10.492
These are the objectives,
five towers.

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:12.713
There has to be something more.

01:12:13.382 --> 01:12:16.218
Walter fixes it so you take the blame.

01:12:16.253 --> 01:12:18.456
The President orders the destruction
and they build everything new.

01:12:18.491 --> 01:12:20.467
- Like in Iraq.
- Exactly.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.409
Except now it's the French

01:12:22.444 --> 01:12:24.966
And how are they going to destroy
the towers?

01:12:28.106 --> 01:12:29.950
In position.

01:12:56.241 --> 01:12:59.272
There are three helicopters.
They're up there already.

01:13:00.446 --> 01:13:02.487
The choppers will laze the targets.

01:13:02.781 --> 01:13:04.438
Next, the missles.

01:13:09.353 --> 01:13:10.504
How?

01:13:10.539 --> 01:13:13.096
Probably from a command center.

01:13:13.131 --> 01:13:15.430
Only the President of the Republic can
give an order like that.

01:13:15.465 --> 01:13:17.395
How can we prevent it.

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:20.205
Better read the manual.
Because your little bossy voice...

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.298
...is beginning to piss me off.

01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:26.357
Bothers you that I make jokes?

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:30.171
I Apologize.

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:34.155
If I call you "lechuguita",
woul you like this better.

01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:37.434
- And if you call me by my name?
- OK.

01:13:38.093 --> 01:13:39.470
What's your name.

01:13:39.505 --> 01:13:42.475
Damián Tomaso, commander
of the French army.

01:13:44.307 --> 01:13:46.815
A policeman, if you prefer.

01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:52.183
Now I think it's better if we put our
differences aside...

01:13:52.762 --> 01:13:55.324
...And give each other a hand.

01:14:06.604 --> 01:14:09.641
Tao, a pleasure.

01:14:09.676 --> 01:14:11.380
Likewise.

01:14:14.106 --> 01:14:17.464
Now, what's your plan,
lechuguita?

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.268
- Thanks for coming.
- What's this about?

01:14:44.235 --> 01:14:45.984
We'll explain it to you.

01:15:02.330 --> 01:15:03.711
Hello.

01:15:07.312 --> 01:15:09.747
It's through there.

01:15:25.442 --> 01:15:27.596
Alika, guns.

01:15:29.264 --> 01:15:32.471
Marcho, specialist
in machetes.

01:15:34.202 --> 01:15:37.385
Carlos Skin,
specialist with cars.

01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:42.163
Montana, bombs.

01:15:43.382 --> 01:15:44.896
Excuse me.

01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:50.248
Can they cover these areas?

01:15:50.452 --> 01:15:53.154
Yes, they wouldn't let an oppurtunity
to show their skill pass them by.

01:15:59.184 --> 01:16:00.914
Sirs.

01:16:01.398 --> 01:16:03.826
Thanks to all
for coming.

01:16:04.366 --> 01:16:07.519
It's been 19 hours since sector 13
was evacuated.

01:16:08.112 --> 01:16:10.253
Their intention is to level it completely.

01:16:10.288 --> 01:16:13.141
I have everything that we need.

01:16:14.016 --> 01:16:16.362
The idea is to avoid it.

01:16:19.222 --> 01:16:21.279
All in favor?

01:16:32.469 --> 01:16:35.376
Well, then I'll pass it off...

01:16:36.109 --> 01:16:39.237
...To Damián to explain his plan.

01:16:45.181 --> 01:16:49.323
We all have to come to an agreement in the
five hours we have left.

01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:53.425
I'll need about thirty men...

01:16:54.166 --> 01:16:56.389
Trained in combat, with no need for weapons.

01:16:56.424 --> 01:16:57.821
We're not going hunting.

01:16:57.856 --> 01:17:00.460
We infiltrate in silence, neutralize the enemy...

01:17:00.495 --> 01:17:03.064
...And go directly
to the centre of operations.

01:17:04.062 --> 01:17:05.717
Questions?

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.725
Where is the command center?

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:14.768
Here, in París.

01:17:29.274 --> 01:17:31.849
Through here, Mr President.

01:17:39.329 --> 01:17:42.326
Reinforce the security
around the building.

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.105
Go give the signal.

01:17:55.115 --> 01:17:57.815
Remain in the air.

01:18:01.147 --> 01:18:03.929
Good morning, sirs.
Take your seats.

01:18:05.997 --> 01:18:08.234
So, General,
where are we on this?

01:18:08.269 --> 01:18:11.246
The Jaguards are waiting for the order to
take the targets.

01:18:11.281 --> 01:18:14.305
I was talking about evacuation not destruction.

01:18:15.053 --> 01:18:17.222
That's our priority is it not?

01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:18.973
Yes, sir.

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:20.861
Mr President.

01:18:21.287 --> 01:18:24.830
We've evacuated 1,087,310
people in the last two hours...

01:18:25.187 --> 01:18:27.786
...But there are sectors we can't get near.

01:18:27.821 --> 01:18:30.070
Precisely all the people
located here.

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:32.319
We tried and there were casualties.

01:18:32.354 --> 01:18:34.910
This could delay everything.

01:18:36.315 --> 01:18:38.889
How many people have not been evacuated?

01:18:38.924 --> 01:18:41.115
Long time since we did a census in this neighbourhood...

01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:43.389
...But a few thousand people.

01:18:44.028 --> 01:18:47.026
Those few, are too many.
Continue the evacuation.

01:18:53.076 --> 01:18:55.379
- Command sent us here.
- Us too!

01:19:07.102 --> 01:19:09.317
Very Well.

01:19:19.331 --> 01:19:21.992
Turn both keys
at the same time.

01:19:22.027 --> 01:19:25.210
Five missiles, all will go out
at the same time.

01:20:12.198 --> 01:20:14.652
To tell you the truth,
sirs...

01:20:15.029 --> 01:20:17.872
...I do not like this at all.

01:20:17.907 --> 01:20:20.693
- May I give you some advice?
- Please.

01:20:21.131 --> 01:20:23.943
I Know these types of men.

01:20:24.145 --> 01:20:26.939
They don't respect anything, people,
laws, nothing.

01:20:26.974 --> 01:20:29.486
They kill and steal only for profit

01:20:29.521 --> 01:20:31.602
And you aren't responsible for that.

01:20:31.637 --> 01:20:33.684
They were here before your arrival.

01:20:33.719 --> 01:20:36.028
And what can we do with them?

01:20:36.063 --> 01:20:38.021
Speak with them?
No.

01:20:38.056 --> 01:20:41.158
The only way to rid yourself of them is
extermination

01:20:59.498 --> 01:21:00.946
¡Alert!

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:13.020
Mr Gazmán, I find your cynicism terrorist-like.

01:21:13.522 --> 01:21:16.204
No, Mr President, I'm only
being pragmatic.

01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:20.959
One of the causes of our
recession is this parallel economy...

01:21:20.994 --> 01:21:25.211
...With these types around we lose millions in taxes
which should be coming to the state.

01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:27.977
With this destruction...

01:21:28.012 --> 01:21:31.914
...We can build a place that
will actually be earning us money

01:21:32.131 --> 01:21:35.117
We can rid ourselve of this scar,
and build something new and profitable.

01:21:35.329 --> 01:21:39.139
Destroy to build? That's your solution?

01:21:39.596 --> 01:21:42.386
In any case, it's what comes to mind.

01:21:52.316 --> 01:21:54.627
Through here.

01:21:56.078 --> 01:21:57.681
General.

01:21:58.024 --> 01:22:00.653
Assault choppers are in the air.

01:22:01.956 --> 01:22:02.917
Good.

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:04.871
Make them land.

01:22:05.997 --> 01:22:08.887
I won't put this key in this lock...

01:22:08.922 --> 01:22:12.305
...Until I'm convinced that
there aren't any civilians in this neighbourhood.

01:22:13.269 --> 01:22:15.238
- Understood?
- Very Well, sir.

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:53.813
My General, a group just entered the building.

01:22:53.848 --> 01:22:55.217
Well, neutralize them.

01:22:55.252 --> 01:22:57.783
They aren't armed,
but there are alot of them.

01:22:57.818 --> 01:22:59.624
Continue, I'll handle it.

01:23:04.204 --> 01:23:06.211
Go see what's happening.

01:23:12.816 --> 01:23:15.335
Go guys.

01:24:22.853 --> 01:24:25.319
Montana, I said no injuries.

01:24:25.354 --> 01:24:27.786
Its for
my personal security.

01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:34.127
What's going on?

01:24:34.782 --> 01:24:37.359
Don't worry, the building
is strongly reinforced.

01:24:37.937 --> 01:24:39.376
Chill.

01:24:46.197 --> 01:24:49.430
That is mine.

01:25:02.716 --> 01:25:05.514
So?
How do you prefer it?

01:25:06.510 --> 01:25:09.717
Listen, you don't have...

01:25:14.317 --> 01:25:16.675
The rules are to be respected.

01:25:16.881 --> 01:25:19.378
But not with people like you.

01:25:22.895 --> 01:25:26.091
We love to meet people like you.

01:25:28.388 --> 01:25:30.681
And those ears?

01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:35.646
You ok?

01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:43.332
Doesn't answer.

01:25:45.233 --> 01:25:46.530
I'll call you.

01:25:46.862 --> 01:25:49.824
Mr President, I'm pleased to inform you
that sector 13 has been completely evacuated.

01:25:51.558 --> 01:25:54.837
How? Just an hour ago we almost...

01:25:54.872 --> 01:25:56.821
...weren't able to evacuate a few thousand civilians.

01:25:56.856 --> 01:25:59.805
I don't know perhaps the message did not arrive.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.754
In any case, sector 13 is empty, I
guarantee it.

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:11.841
In that case.

01:26:20.651 --> 01:26:23.509
Get them in position.

01:26:25.112 --> 01:26:27.692
Signal received,
attack commencing in one minute.

01:26:27.906 --> 01:26:29.813
We Are in position,
Mr President.

01:26:46.939 --> 01:26:48.890
Don't move!
Stay put!

01:26:48.925 --> 01:26:50.766
I say...!

01:26:52.903 --> 01:26:55.955
This is the hand that I'll shove down your throat
if you don't shut up.

01:27:01.211 --> 01:27:03.583
Sirs, I am the President
of the Republic.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.643
- The one from the television.
- I have seen him on the Internet.

01:27:09.736 --> 01:27:12.371
Captain Tomaso,
explain yourself.

01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:15.951
Pictures speak louder than words, Mr President.

01:27:26.801 --> 01:27:29.057
- Keep recording.
- what is this?

01:27:31.628 --> 01:27:34.565
Don't know, keep recording.

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.465
Shit!

01:27:38.812 --> 01:27:40.041
What is this?

01:27:40.076 --> 01:27:41.755
The DISS in action.

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:43.769
The DISS wanted to
discredit the entire sector...

01:27:43.804 --> 01:27:46.757
...To destroy it all
and afterwards go back and rebuild.

01:27:46.792 --> 01:27:49.392
I'm sure they were compensated for it as well.

01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.669
If the images
aren't satisfactory...

01:27:52.704 --> 01:27:55.861
...I have here a disk of
special operations from the DISS.

01:27:56.577 --> 01:27:59.152
Isn't this true, Walter?

01:28:00.808 --> 01:28:03.227
IT's why they sent him on a vacation.

01:28:03.718 --> 01:28:05.097
Nobody move!

01:28:05.132 --> 01:28:07.258
What are you doing?

01:28:07.853 --> 01:28:09.818
Take out the key.

01:28:10.727 --> 01:28:13.584
Take out the key.
Fast.

01:28:14.065 --> 01:28:15.418
Let's go!

01:28:15.453 --> 01:28:17.744
Take out the key.

01:28:17.779 --> 01:28:21.887
Do what I say, remove the key.

01:28:23.327 --> 01:28:25.416
What's happening?

01:28:27.451 --> 01:28:30.060
There's going to be new elections.

01:28:30.095 --> 01:28:32.634
Go, leave the
freworks, just the key.

01:28:32.669 --> 01:28:35.736
¡Tomaso, do not move!
If you move I'll kill him.

01:28:36.455 --> 01:28:39.568
C'mon, turn the key I said!

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:51.725
Signal received! Ready!

01:28:51.964 --> 01:28:53.344
Go.

01:28:53.379 --> 01:28:55.576
Stop, Gazmán, you'll never get away with this.

01:28:55.611 --> 01:28:57.774
A soldier goes on until
the end of the mission.

01:28:57.809 --> 01:28:59.846
Even if it
costs him his life.

01:28:59.881 --> 01:29:01.746
It's called honor.

01:29:01.781 --> 01:29:04.903
That's a concept those people in sector 13 have no
notion of.

01:29:06.685 --> 01:29:11.391
Yes, we prefer another concept - family.

01:29:11.616 --> 01:29:13.584
That's what unites us.

01:29:13.619 --> 01:29:15.553
It's what protects us.

01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:17.026
It's what we believe in.

01:29:17.061 --> 01:29:19.839
Unity huh? I think I'm gonna cry.

01:29:20.556 --> 01:29:21.895
Then you'll die united.

01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:24.614
Enough of this shit, where you going?

01:29:24.649 --> 01:29:29.802
Chill, I'm only going to... shit I was
sure that there would be tobacco.

01:29:30.759 --> 01:29:31.978
Leave it.

01:29:33.612 --> 01:29:35.300
Tomaso!

01:29:37.707 --> 01:29:40.252
For my collection.

01:30:00.646 --> 01:30:03.435
This is really nice Mr. President.

01:30:03.904 --> 01:30:05.456
A gift.

01:30:09.493 --> 01:30:11.166
Sirs.

01:30:13.512 --> 01:30:15.633
Miss, excuse me.

01:30:16.412 --> 01:30:19.955
I don't know what to say.

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:24.036
Thank you so much.

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.413
I owe you a debt.

01:30:28.448 --> 01:30:31.687
All of France owes you a debt.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.004
Well, I don't blame you for not trusting a
politician but...

01:30:37.587 --> 01:30:40.617
...I assure you that in
the next 48 hours...

01:30:40.652 --> 01:30:43.789
...I will do what I can
to unblock these present laws...

01:30:44.658 --> 01:30:46.682
...So that this sector
can regain...

01:30:46.717 --> 01:30:50.627
...it's dignity and an important part in
our society.

01:30:53.464 --> 01:30:55.132
Thank you.

01:30:55.441 --> 01:30:58.725
- I Have a question, Mr President.
- Yes?

01:30:59.473 --> 01:31:02.648
Instead of spending a fortune
hiding the rot...

01:31:02.683 --> 01:31:04.669
...why not rebuild?

01:31:04.704 --> 01:31:06.805
What do you mean?

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.907
A true neighbourhood.

01:31:08.942 --> 01:31:10.544
A true city.

01:31:10.579 --> 01:31:13.087
With green spaces
and places to work and play.

01:31:13.544 --> 01:31:15.487
I agree.

01:31:15.522 --> 01:31:20.508
Damián, I'm appointin you head of this project
until it's culmination.

01:31:23.033 --> 01:31:25.162
Very well Mr President.

01:31:25.938 --> 01:31:29.323
You have my word, just as much as the governments.

01:31:29.533 --> 01:31:31.855
Your word as a man?

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:34.766
My word as a man.

01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:37.799
¿Sirs?

01:31:38.436 --> 01:31:41.566
- Fine by me.
- Me too.

01:31:41.969 --> 01:31:43.527
Yes.

01:31:43.562 --> 01:31:44.821
Of course.

01:31:44.856 --> 01:31:46.822
Yes.

01:31:47.727 --> 01:31:49.226
Very Well.

01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:08.673
Well, that's better

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.545
