01:18.444 --> 01:19.879
Sorry,
I'm nervous.

01:19.912 --> 01:21.915
It's okay. No rush.

01:23.382 --> 01:25.184
Let's talk boundaries.

01:25.216 --> 01:27.486
I'm up for anything.
No boundaries for me.

01:28.319 --> 01:29.188
What?

01:32.358 --> 01:35.761
Did you talk about your
boundaries before this?

01:35.793 --> 01:37.896
Well, sort of.
Maybe... not really.

01:37.930 --> 01:43.302
Well, um, is there anything
you don't want Juna to do?

01:43.334 --> 01:45.838
I don't know.
I didn't really think about that.

01:46.671 --> 01:47.873
What about you, Juna?

01:47.906 --> 01:50.976
Is there anything you
don't want Kali to do?

01:51.609 --> 01:52.879
Um...

01:53.311 --> 01:55.780
No.

01:55.813 --> 01:57.516
What if she
ignores you?

02:00.852 --> 02:02.155
That depends.

02:04.156 --> 02:10.096
So, you're okay, if she pays
no attention to you whatsoever?

02:10.695 --> 02:11.730
Oh.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.399
I didn't say that.

02:13.431 --> 02:16.067
You know, the most important
thing is to listen.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.572
So, if something doesn't feel
right, then speak up.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.718
Maybe we could have
dinner next time.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.287
Only if I get
to eat off you two.

03:41.319 --> 03:44.389
Oh, my God.
You never want to eat off of me.

03:45.556 --> 03:46.425
Okay.

03:48.661 --> 03:51.296
- Thank you.
- Oh, wait. Three...

04:05.877 --> 04:06.945
<i>I move in the way</i>

04:06.979 --> 04:08.648
<i>I know how to
make myself come,</i>

04:08.681 --> 04:10.116
<i>and when I'm close,</i>

04:10.149 --> 04:13.618
<i>I pull Kali's hair and
kiss her with abandon.</i>

04:13.651 --> 04:17.188
<i>I'm in ecstasy as my
climax erases all thought,</i>

04:17.221 --> 04:21.526
<i>and I'm fully present with
this couple I hardly know.</i>

04:25.396 --> 04:28.867
<i>It's strange, though,
for the first time in ten years,</i>

04:28.901 --> 04:32.538
<i>in the end,
I feel... nothing.</i>

04:33.706 --> 04:35.040
<i>Hmm.</i>

04:36.408 --> 04:37.310
<i>No.</i>

04:38.343 --> 04:41.913
<i>In the end,
I'm still amazed</i>

04:41.947 --> 04:43.949
<i>that three people
can come together</i>

04:43.982 --> 04:47.620
<i>in mutual desire
and not fall apart.</i>

05:02.201 --> 05:03.136
Nice.

05:09.507 --> 05:12.177
Hey,
you're Veronica Willow right?

05:12.211 --> 05:14.180
- Veronica Williams.
- Yeah. Do I know you?

05:14.213 --> 05:16.949
- I'm a super fan of your blog.
- Oh, cool.

05:16.982 --> 05:19.785
Yeah. Sex with
intention, I love that!

05:19.817 --> 05:22.921
- Thank you.
- It's, like, about love and connection, right?

05:22.954 --> 05:24.656
Exactly, yeah.

05:24.689 --> 05:26.625
I can't believe I'm standing
here talking to you.

05:26.658 --> 05:28.628
This is nuts.
Right in front of my building.

05:30.062 --> 05:31.697
Can I take
a selfie real quick?

05:31.730 --> 05:33.566
- Uh, sure.
- Just real quick.

05:33.598 --> 05:34.899
- Get that for me.
- Okay.

05:34.932 --> 05:36.569
- Thanks. I got short thumbs.
- Okay.

05:36.601 --> 05:38.137
Yeah, I'll put that
right on my Instagram.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.672
- Okay, nice to meet you.
- I got, like, 38 followers.

05:39.704 --> 05:44.043
Hey, I'm so curious about
that polyamory stuff.

05:44.076 --> 05:45.511
Yeah, a lot of people are.
It's...

05:45.543 --> 05:47.012
It's wild, right?

05:48.379 --> 05:49.314
Yeah.

05:49.348 --> 05:50.983
Yeah, cool.
If you have any questions,

05:51.016 --> 05:52.785
just leave a comment
and I'll respond.

05:52.817 --> 05:54.486
I got to say,

05:54.519 --> 05:56.955
you are so gorgeous...

05:56.988 --> 05:58.858
Like, right here
right now. Are you...

05:58.891 --> 06:00.225
- I mean...
- Thank you.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.795
You ever think about doing porn
or, you know?

06:05.396 --> 06:06.331
No.

06:06.798 --> 06:08.100
No. Have you?

06:09.802 --> 06:10.770
Watch out.

06:18.677 --> 06:20.046
And, up.

06:21.579 --> 06:25.250
And Swan Dive down.

06:25.283 --> 06:29.055
If you're warmed up,
go ahead to the Upward-Facing Dog.

06:31.523 --> 06:32.658
And, breathe.

06:32.690 --> 06:36.094
From here,
reach forward with the right hand,

06:36.127 --> 06:37.829
reverse the Warrior.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.266
And Warrior Two.

06:42.701 --> 06:47.473
From here, let's take a side-angle
pose, elbow on the knee,

06:47.505 --> 06:51.376
hand to the ground,
or take it behind.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.380
Just extend the energy
through your fingers.

06:56.882 --> 06:59.084
See our
chemistry, baby.

06:59.117 --> 07:00.720
And Warrior Two.

07:06.324 --> 07:08.694
Relax the shoulders.

07:08.726 --> 07:12.697
- It's a fucking horse penis.
- Seriously.

07:21.639 --> 07:23.776
Come to Chemistry
with me on Saturday.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.780
Babe, you know how
I feel about that.

07:27.812 --> 07:29.548
Well, hello, ladies.

07:29.581 --> 07:31.550
- Hi.
- Can I help you with anything today?

07:31.583 --> 07:34.620
Looking for something to dominate
my wayward girlfriend with.

07:34.653 --> 07:38.724
Okay, well, this is
a beginner's crop.

07:38.757 --> 07:40.059
It's very lightweight.

07:40.091 --> 07:44.262
But, if you're looking for
something a little bit more intense,

07:44.696 --> 07:45.765
check this one.

07:48.300 --> 07:49.901
Uh, thank you.
We are just browsing.

07:49.935 --> 07:52.571
Ah, okay. Well, let me know if there's
anything else I can do to help.

07:52.603 --> 07:53.538
Thank you.

07:54.973 --> 07:56.675
- It's intense.
- Mm.

07:57.843 --> 08:00.012
- I don't know.
- I can handle it.

08:00.045 --> 08:02.081
Yeah, I'm sure
you could.

08:02.113 --> 08:05.150
But, you don't want
me to go to Chemistry.

08:07.252 --> 08:10.422
No, it's cool...

08:10.454 --> 08:12.358
as long as you respect
the boundaries.

08:13.692 --> 08:14.759
Of course.

08:16.961 --> 08:18.764
Of course.
Who do you think I am?

08:24.036 --> 08:25.170
You like that?

08:28.807 --> 08:32.311
You know, there are so many
hot, sexy women

08:32.344 --> 08:36.482
who would love to play
with us at Chemistry.

08:36.514 --> 08:38.783
I'm gonna tie you up,
so you can't move.

08:39.250 --> 08:40.418
Fuck you so hard

08:40.451 --> 08:42.388
you won't think of
anyone else but me.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.798
<i>Many of
you have asked me,</i>

08:53.831 --> 08:57.235
<i>"Is true love a reason
to be monogamous?"</i>

08:57.269 --> 08:59.804
<i>Well, I can only
speak for myself.</i>

09:00.905 --> 09:04.075
<i>There's no such thing
as happily ever after.</i>

09:04.109 --> 09:07.513
<i>There's no such thing
as "the one".</i>

09:07.546 --> 09:10.015
<i>But, if I can find a
little bit of "the one",</i>

09:10.048 --> 09:12.484
<i>in each person
I fall for,</i>

09:12.517 --> 09:15.688
<i>and they see a little
bit of "the one" in me,</i>

09:15.721 --> 09:18.524
<i>what could be more
romantic than that?</i>

09:18.557 --> 09:20.927
Move your right arm
a little that way.

09:22.027 --> 09:22.995
A little more.

09:28.332 --> 09:29.568
How's your mother?

09:30.501 --> 09:32.203
She's doing better.

09:32.236 --> 09:35.274
I think I'm going to visit
her for spring break.

09:35.307 --> 09:37.342
My cousin has a new
tour company in Tulum.

09:38.309 --> 09:39.611
Can make some
extra money.

09:41.379 --> 09:43.548
What about
your classes?

09:43.581 --> 09:45.583
Just for a few weeks.
Don't worry,

09:45.616 --> 09:46.651
I'll be back.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.824
Come to Chemistry
with me this Saturday.

09:51.856 --> 09:54.759
I wish I could,
but I work the late shift.

09:56.061 --> 09:57.663
I need a break.

10:02.734 --> 10:03.636
Hmm.

11:03.628 --> 11:06.666
- Veronica.
- Hey, Tai.

11:08.466 --> 11:10.668
Love the last
blog post.

11:10.701 --> 11:12.870
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:12.903 --> 11:14.038
This one's on us.

11:14.072 --> 11:15.841
- Thank you!
- Enjoy.

11:25.283 --> 11:27.485
- You, look at you.
- What's happening?

11:29.120 --> 11:33.591
- Actually, I'm corporate Caesar.
- Oh, yeah. Nice.

11:36.260 --> 11:40.598
<i>Each party holds
a possibility of forgetting,</i>

11:40.631 --> 11:43.702
<i>of losing
and finding myself.</i>

11:44.668 --> 11:46.538
<i>Time and ego
dissolve</i>

11:46.571 --> 11:48.440
<i>in the fantasy
of costume,</i>

11:48.472 --> 11:51.209
<i>the anonymity
of disguise,</i>

11:51.243 --> 11:53.646
<i>the spectacle
of burlesque.</i>

11:55.279 --> 11:57.182
<i>It doesn't matter
where we come from</i>

11:57.215 --> 11:59.718
<i>or what we do
for a living.</i>

11:59.750 --> 12:03.154
<i>Past mistakes and future
dreams are irrelevant.</i>

12:04.589 --> 12:08.660
<i>Here, we are all animals,
alive and wanting,</i>

12:08.692 --> 12:10.962
<i>connected by the
need to survive,</i>

12:10.995 --> 12:13.631
<i>seeking more or less
the same thing.</i>

12:16.333 --> 12:19.203
<i>I long to forget
my experience</i>

12:19.236 --> 12:21.639
<i>and find
my innocent self,</i>

12:21.673 --> 12:25.677
<i>through another's
wide, hungry eyes.</i>

12:25.710 --> 12:28.312
Are you ready for a show?

12:28.346 --> 12:32.985
I said, are you ready for a
show to wet your appetite?

13:06.317 --> 13:07.620
Oh!

13:08.419 --> 13:09.954
I am so sorry.

13:13.091 --> 13:15.661
- I didn't mean to...
- Why don't you lick it off?

13:16.260 --> 13:17.829
Excuse me?

13:17.863 --> 13:19.164
The mess you made
on her boots.

13:19.197 --> 13:20.331
Why don't you
lick it off?

13:20.365 --> 13:21.933
The couple,
they bumped into...

13:21.966 --> 13:24.502
- Sure, sure. Yes, right.
- It wasn't my fault.

13:24.535 --> 13:27.806
- It's okay.
- I'm just playing.

13:29.173 --> 13:30.274
Sure, you are.

13:33.711 --> 13:35.480
- See you later?
- Mm-hmm.

13:43.087 --> 13:43.988
I'll just...

14:04.643 --> 14:06.511
Have you been
to Chemistry before?

14:06.543 --> 14:07.879
No.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.649
My friend didn't tell me it
was this kind of party...

14:10.682 --> 14:12.149
What? Really?

14:12.182 --> 14:14.385
...where people
have sex.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.621
So, who's your friend?

14:16.654 --> 14:20.024
Oh, over there,
with the blue suit.

14:20.057 --> 14:22.727
That's Benton.
He's my friend, too.

14:23.427 --> 14:24.629
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:24.663 --> 14:27.066
- Wow. What a small world.
- Yeah.

14:30.501 --> 14:33.705
- I'm Veronica.
- Daniel.

14:41.679 --> 14:44.616
Oh, so, um,
you're married?

14:45.049 --> 14:45.984
Yes.

14:47.085 --> 14:48.921
- Is she here?
- No.

14:50.221 --> 14:51.322
What's your agreement?

14:51.355 --> 14:52.924
What do you mean,
"agreement"?

14:54.725 --> 14:57.562
- Veronica.
- Hello.

14:58.263 --> 15:00.032
Well, have fun.

15:00.065 --> 15:01.066
You, too.

15:01.099 --> 15:03.869
Maybe next time you
can bring your spouse.

15:54.184 --> 15:57.288
Babe, Dexter was too
ridiculous today. Look.

15:58.655 --> 16:00.758
What did he do now?

16:00.792 --> 16:02.661
- I totally caught this...
- Oh, no.

16:03.794 --> 16:06.998
- Why is he always doing that?
- Aww.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.401
Oh wait, watch this.
He's so cute.

16:10.434 --> 16:11.769
No, no.

16:12.937 --> 16:15.941
Do you think that's funny?

16:15.974 --> 16:18.911
That's not funny.
He just broke that glass.

16:19.644 --> 16:22.080
Did you say
anything to him?

16:22.113 --> 16:24.349
Well, I tried to.

16:24.381 --> 16:26.650
Yeah, right.
No, you didn't.

16:26.683 --> 16:28.187
Oh, Dexter.

16:31.623 --> 16:34.026
Come on in.

16:46.538 --> 16:47.773
Hey.

16:56.047 --> 16:58.582
Hi. Hi.

17:25.041 --> 17:28.913
We have a studio for
$1,500 in Flatbush.

17:28.946 --> 17:30.048
Does that
interest you?

17:31.816 --> 17:32.750
We have...

17:32.784 --> 17:34.486
Excuse me.

17:36.921 --> 17:38.523
Burr Real Estate,
Daniel speaking.

17:38.556 --> 17:42.360
<i>Hi, Daniel,
it's Veronica from Chemistry.</i>

17:42.393 --> 17:45.230
Benton gave me
your number.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.932
Yeah, from work.

17:47.965 --> 17:51.869
I was wondering if you would
like to go to dinner with me.

17:54.771 --> 17:57.509
A date? No, not really. I...

17:57.541 --> 18:01.278
Well,
maybe he told you that I'm a blogger

18:01.311 --> 18:04.849
and I blog about sex
and relationships.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.852
And, yeah,
you're interesting to me,

18:06.884 --> 18:09.821
and I've been looking
for new subjects.

18:11.489 --> 18:15.727
Well, I don't meet that many
monogamous people at Chemistry.

18:15.759 --> 18:19.397
And, so, I'm curious, uh,
what it was like for you.

18:23.401 --> 18:25.437
Yeah, well, no pressure,
and it's up to you.

18:33.778 --> 18:35.247
You're going to
love this place.

18:35.279 --> 18:36.147
I know the chef.

18:36.181 --> 18:38.250
He sources everything
from local farms.

18:38.282 --> 18:40.184
Yeah. So, everything is organic

18:40.218 --> 18:42.187
and you can really
taste the difference.

18:42.220 --> 18:45.524
Oh, his pork belly with
truffle oil is to die for.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.959
- Mmm.
- Yes.

18:47.991 --> 18:51.163
So, did you enjoy the
rest of the party?

18:52.696 --> 18:54.331
Yes.

18:54.365 --> 18:58.135
I didn't do anything,
but it was interesting to watch.

18:58.169 --> 18:59.070
Uh-huh.

18:59.103 --> 19:00.705
First time for
everything, right?

19:00.738 --> 19:02.507
Right.

19:02.539 --> 19:04.142
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:04.174 --> 19:08.712
Um, what do you think
about super spicy food?

19:08.746 --> 19:11.783
I love it.
I mean, I'm Korean, so yeah.

19:11.816 --> 19:15.319
Well, me,
I can only handle a little spice.

19:15.353 --> 19:18.423
I'm... ginger.

19:18.455 --> 19:19.256
Ginger's my favorite.

19:19.289 --> 19:21.326
Ginger's my favorite
spice also.

19:21.358 --> 19:22.059
- Really?
- Yes.

19:22.093 --> 19:24.028
- Wow.
- It's so versatile.

19:24.061 --> 19:26.464
It is. It is.
It's so versatile.

19:26.897 --> 19:28.366
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:35.673 --> 19:36.840
...it just
doesn't help

19:36.874 --> 19:38.643
not knowing
anyone like that.

19:38.675 --> 19:40.878
Yeah, well,
ask away

19:40.912 --> 19:47.085
'cause I'm open to
answering all questions.

19:47.117 --> 19:50.355
I usually ask people to
take their shoes off inside.

19:50.387 --> 19:51.222
Right.
Yeah, me, too.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.358
- If that's okay.
- I do the same thing.

19:53.391 --> 19:55.026
You don't know what you're
stepping on outside.

19:55.058 --> 19:56.728
- Yeah, exactly.
- Yeah.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.395
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:59.596 --> 20:02.067
So, this is my place.
I'm gonna turn the light on.

20:03.067 --> 20:04.603
- Wow.
- This is my place.

20:04.635 --> 20:05.604
- It's beautiful.
- Welcome.

20:05.636 --> 20:06.605
Ah, there's a cat.

20:06.637 --> 20:07.672
- This is Lulu.
- This is Lulu.

20:07.704 --> 20:09.974
- Yeah.
- You're so beautiful.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.179
Mm, wow, okay.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.317
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.921
Yeah, take this off.

20:24.855 --> 20:25.923
Yeah.

20:35.199 --> 20:38.937
Um, can we just do it
somewhere else?

20:38.970 --> 20:40.005
Oh, yeah,
yeah, sure.

20:40.038 --> 20:42.274
- This is kind of awkward.
- Yeah.

20:44.174 --> 20:45.243
Okay.

20:46.443 --> 20:47.912
It's just...

20:47.944 --> 20:49.013
Okay.

20:49.547 --> 20:50.914
- Turn.
- Yeah.

20:50.948 --> 20:52.451
Yeah.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.840
Oh, my God.

21:16.874 --> 21:19.477
- I'm gonna come.
- Oh, yeah, come.

21:55.246 --> 21:58.517
Aww. You're so pretty.
Hey.

21:59.483 --> 22:01.019
So cute.

22:01.051 --> 22:03.320
- Lulu?
- Yeah, she likes you.

22:03.354 --> 22:05.690
Yeah? Hey.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.193
Do you have a cat?

22:09.926 --> 22:11.995
Yes. We have a cat.

22:12.028 --> 22:12.997
Dexter.

22:13.029 --> 22:14.465
- Aww.
- Yeah.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.206
I...

22:22.240 --> 22:24.675
I usually
don't do this.

22:25.675 --> 22:27.044
Oh, me neither.

22:27.077 --> 22:31.182
I usually don't sleep with married
people unless they are poly.

22:34.986 --> 22:36.355
Would you like
some water?

22:36.854 --> 22:37.788
Uh, no.

22:42.426 --> 22:44.061
Are you going
to tell your wife?

22:45.997 --> 22:47.099
No.

22:50.968 --> 22:52.437
Well, I have to
tell my girlfriend.

22:53.904 --> 22:56.173
I thought you can do
whatever you want.

22:56.207 --> 22:57.909
No, no.
We have agreements.

23:07.451 --> 23:08.619
I have to go.

23:21.531 --> 23:22.533
Okay.

23:23.468 --> 23:24.603
Bye.

23:32.175 --> 23:33.644
That fucking Pedro.

23:33.678 --> 23:34.813
It wasn't Pedro.

23:34.846 --> 23:36.181
You could have
checked in.

23:36.213 --> 23:38.081
I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

23:38.115 --> 23:40.785
- I got carried away.
- Look, we have a relationship.

23:40.817 --> 23:42.086
Yes.

23:42.118 --> 23:44.254
Yes. I'm sorry.
There wasn't a convenient time.

23:44.288 --> 23:46.825
- Did you enjoy it?
- Joanne, please.

23:46.857 --> 23:48.393
Did you enjoy it?

23:50.060 --> 23:51.695
I love you.

23:51.729 --> 23:53.097
I fucking love you.

23:53.463 --> 23:54.365
I did poly.

23:54.798 --> 23:56.100
For you.

23:56.567 --> 23:57.868
Hey, everyone.

23:57.902 --> 24:00.270
This is my bisexual girlfriend.

24:00.304 --> 24:02.073
- Stop.
- She only wants to be with me

24:02.105 --> 24:04.209
if she can be
with guys, too.

24:04.241 --> 24:06.577
You always had someone else
in the back of your life.

24:06.611 --> 24:08.546
- You don't care about me or anyone.
- No.

24:08.578 --> 24:09.547
- No.
- No.

24:09.579 --> 24:11.215
Hey, hey!

24:11.249 --> 24:13.750
What the hell!

24:13.784 --> 24:16.153
What the fuck!
What's wrong with you?

24:47.984 --> 24:51.423
<i>Relationship
agreements are like allergies.</i>

24:52.222 --> 24:54.192
<i>There's no
obvious reason</i>

24:54.224 --> 24:55.926
<i>why one person has
a violent reaction</i>

24:55.960 --> 24:59.963
<i>if her husband holds another
woman's hand in a movie theater,</i>

24:59.997 --> 25:02.734
<i>while another,
like my ex-girlfriend,</i>

25:02.767 --> 25:05.670
<i>explodes when I have
sex with someone else</i>

25:05.702 --> 25:07.571
<i>in our apartment.</i>

25:07.605 --> 25:11.375
<i>Polyamory makes me feel
like I'm above cheating</i>

25:11.409 --> 25:14.345
<i>because I make my own
rules and agreements.</i>

25:14.377 --> 25:17.147
<i>But when I break
my rules,</i>

25:17.181 --> 25:19.250
<i>there's no one
else to blame.</i>

25:20.651 --> 25:25.089
<i>Joanne was never totally
comfortable with my lifestyle.</i>

25:25.122 --> 25:26.958
<i>I needed to end my
relationship with her,</i>

25:26.990 --> 25:29.727
<i>but I didn't know
when or how.</i>

25:29.759 --> 25:32.430
<i>Along came someone
to do it for me.</i>

25:48.846 --> 25:49.913
Red's my color.

25:49.946 --> 25:51.615
Oh...

25:53.351 --> 25:55.420
- You do that.
- Mm.

25:56.220 --> 25:58.423
Oh, wait, wait.

25:58.455 --> 26:00.023
I am a delicate flower.

26:00.057 --> 26:01.326
Oh, my...

26:04.461 --> 26:06.396
I read your story,
<i>preciosa,</i>

26:06.430 --> 26:09.734
it made me cringe,
it made me laugh,

26:10.800 --> 26:11.903
it made me
want more.

26:13.237 --> 26:14.773
My apology.

26:16.207 --> 26:17.241
Close.

26:23.346 --> 26:27.518
Yeah, well,
my followers don't want art,

26:27.550 --> 26:31.688
- they want smut.
- So what?

26:31.721 --> 26:33.791
Do what you want,
don't care what they think.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.661
That was actually...

26:36.693 --> 26:38.997
Oh, God, I look
like my mother.

26:47.505 --> 26:49.607
Have you
always been polygamous?

26:49.640 --> 26:53.478
Well, it was
always in me,

26:53.510 --> 26:56.714
but my first love was
blissfully monogamous.

26:58.281 --> 27:00.150
We were so young
and in love.

27:00.183 --> 27:02.720
It didn't feel like
monogamy, you know.

27:02.752 --> 27:03.788
Yeah.

27:04.989 --> 27:06.024
But it ended,

27:06.057 --> 27:10.362
and monogamy hasn't
appealed to me since then.

27:15.566 --> 27:17.669
You know, I feel
weird saying this,

27:17.701 --> 27:20.904
but after you
and I had sex,

27:20.938 --> 27:24.042
I went home and had
sex with my wife.

27:24.741 --> 27:25.442
Oh!

27:25.476 --> 27:27.712
We hadn't had
sex in months.

27:27.744 --> 27:29.279
You're welcome?

27:29.313 --> 27:32.817
You inspired me.

27:37.387 --> 27:39.390
Are you sure
it wasn't guilt?

27:41.325 --> 27:44.194
I did feel
guilty at first.

27:44.228 --> 27:46.431
But then, I felt more
attracted to her.

27:49.666 --> 27:50.868
I, uh...

27:52.635 --> 27:55.138
I would love to
keep seeing you.

27:55.172 --> 27:58.375
The hope that it will bring
something back to my marriage.

28:00.544 --> 28:02.847
Does this mean you'll go
to a sex party with me?

28:03.547 --> 28:05.783
I mean,
you and your wife.

28:05.816 --> 28:08.452
Oh, I don't know.

28:13.590 --> 28:16.093
So, babe, uh...

28:16.126 --> 28:17.194
Baby, what do you...

28:17.228 --> 28:19.297
How do you feel about
going to a party

28:19.329 --> 28:21.698
that is actually
a sex party,

28:21.731 --> 28:24.402
but, um...

28:24.434 --> 28:26.870
It's like a sex party,
but no pressure.

28:26.903 --> 28:29.606
We could just kind of drink
and chill out and make friends.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.642
You want me
to go to an orgy?

28:31.674 --> 28:33.644
Well, it's not just a
bunch of people fucking,

28:33.676 --> 28:35.045
it's an actual party,
you know.

28:35.078 --> 28:38.281
They have separate rooms for
mingling, drinks, food.

28:38.315 --> 28:40.250
It's a really cool,
like, situation.

28:40.284 --> 28:41.152
No.

28:43.586 --> 28:45.189
Look, we don't have
to do anything,

28:45.221 --> 28:46.990
we could watch,
you know...

28:47.023 --> 28:50.828
Babe, in therapy,
you said you'd try new things.

28:55.199 --> 28:58.436
Look, if you want to see other
people, then go ahead.

29:01.771 --> 29:02.773
Are you sure?

29:03.807 --> 29:05.375
No, but...

29:05.409 --> 29:06.945
maybe it's
the best thing.

29:10.181 --> 29:13.817
Look, I'll let you know if
anything happens or I meet someone.

29:13.851 --> 29:16.020
- I don't want to hide anything from you.
- No.

29:16.053 --> 29:16.988
Please don't.

29:20.057 --> 29:21.025
Okay.

29:38.409 --> 29:41.513
Wow,
you look amazing.

29:42.112 --> 29:43.047
Thank you.

29:43.713 --> 29:44.782
Ah. Oh...

29:45.782 --> 29:46.650
tada.

29:47.817 --> 29:49.319
- You like it?
- It's beautiful.

29:49.353 --> 29:50.488
Thank you.

29:51.654 --> 29:54.558
Golden rule is
"ask before you touch".

29:54.592 --> 29:56.127
- Okay.
- Just remember that.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.394
Hi.

29:57.428 --> 29:59.130
No pressure, okay?

29:59.163 --> 30:00.164
No expectations.

30:01.298 --> 30:02.967
You don't have
to do anything...

30:04.300 --> 30:05.903
not even with me.

30:12.776 --> 30:15.145
Hello, sir.
I remember you.

30:15.179 --> 30:16.913
Yeah, I remember you, too.

30:16.946 --> 30:18.015
Do you want a drink?

30:19.282 --> 30:20.917
- Come on, let's get a drink.
- Yeah.

30:20.951 --> 30:23.254
Check it out.
Amazing. So, um...

30:26.589 --> 30:28.025
May I kiss you?

30:30.693 --> 30:32.896
Is it 11:00 already?

30:32.930 --> 30:35.432
She's fine.
We'll see her later.

30:35.465 --> 30:37.567
- Okay.
- She's doing her serving shift.

30:37.601 --> 30:39.604
Oh, okay.

30:53.549 --> 30:55.854
- Fancy meeting you here.
- Hello.

31:02.459 --> 31:03.693
Hi.

31:03.727 --> 31:05.730
Oh, look who I found?

31:05.762 --> 31:08.398
Hi,
good to see you.

31:08.432 --> 31:10.567
Will you come
and play with us?

31:10.601 --> 31:13.137
Well, I'm here with
a date tonight.

31:13.170 --> 31:16.541
- Well, have fun.
- We'll try.

31:17.173 --> 31:19.644
You will.

31:19.676 --> 31:21.645
What do you call this?
What is that?

31:21.679 --> 31:24.749
Maybe later...

31:24.781 --> 31:26.016
Excuse me.

31:27.151 --> 31:30.221
That maybe gives her
permission to keep trying.

31:30.253 --> 31:31.655
What do you want?

31:33.390 --> 31:34.825
I want you.

31:34.857 --> 31:36.693
I want to be
with you.

31:37.861 --> 31:39.597
And maybe your
friend over there.

31:45.068 --> 31:46.069
Good answer.

32:00.250 --> 32:01.184
Just like that.

32:40.391 --> 32:41.926
What's happening?

33:49.460 --> 33:51.162
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

33:52.762 --> 33:55.032
Thank you.

33:57.968 --> 34:01.072
Well, that's a lot of
firsts for one night.

34:01.605 --> 34:03.039
Congratulations.

34:03.073 --> 34:04.809
- Thank you.
- You're a natural.

34:04.842 --> 34:06.076
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:06.109 --> 34:08.878
I didn't think, uh,
I would like seeing you

34:08.911 --> 34:12.382
with someone else,
but it actually felt really open.

34:12.416 --> 34:13.484
I felt happy for you.

34:13.516 --> 34:14.951
That's compersion.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.820
- Compersion?
- Mm-hmm.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.355
It's the opposite
of jealousy.

34:19.155 --> 34:20.891
Oh, does that mean
I'm poly now?

34:21.358 --> 34:23.226
- No.
- Ah.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.797
Going to a sex party
doesn't make you a poly.

34:26.963 --> 34:30.467
Besides, you haven't seen
me with another guy yet.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.570
Okay. One step
at a time.

34:36.273 --> 34:37.306
Hmm.

34:45.282 --> 34:46.484
Want to come over?

34:48.117 --> 34:49.085
Uh...

34:49.119 --> 34:53.257
I told Kristen
that I'm coming home.

34:54.824 --> 34:57.594
Coming home
from what?

34:57.628 --> 35:00.131
You know,
out drinking with the guys.

35:00.164 --> 35:01.999
One
of them got really drunk,

35:02.032 --> 35:05.269
- you know, one of those things.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:06.036 --> 35:08.438
Well, I'll just
call a car.

35:08.472 --> 35:09.974
Yeah.
I'll wait until...

35:10.007 --> 35:11.876
You know,
with you until the car comes.

35:12.675 --> 35:13.943
No, no, that's okay.

35:13.976 --> 35:15.679
- You sure?
- Yeah.

35:15.711 --> 35:17.248
We'll talk.

35:20.617 --> 35:23.187
- Get home safe.
- Thanks.

35:36.432 --> 35:39.836
<i>Last night,
Daddy and I went out to dinner at the club</i>

35:39.869 --> 35:41.605
<i>and we ran into
some old friends.</i>

35:41.637 --> 35:44.208
<i>Do you remember
Ashley Van Houten?</i>

35:45.641 --> 35:46.710
Vaguely.

35:46.742 --> 35:48.011
<i>She just finished
grad school</i>

35:48.045 --> 35:49.313
<i>and is moving
to New York.</i>

35:49.346 --> 35:51.215
<i>If you could
show her around...</i>

35:53.115 --> 35:54.184
Uh...

35:54.918 --> 35:56.720
I don't know.

35:56.753 --> 35:58.989
Ashley and I aren't
into the same things.

35:59.021 --> 36:01.025
<i>Well, it's up to you.</i>

36:01.925 --> 36:03.227
<i>How's your writing?</i>

36:04.228 --> 36:05.061
Uh, good.

36:05.094 --> 36:07.230
I am very busy
with my blog.

36:07.264 --> 36:10.434
Um, I have
a lot of fans, so.

36:10.467 --> 36:13.304
<i>I'm glad you found
people who like It.</i>

36:13.336 --> 36:15.773
<i>I tried reading it once,
but I had to stop.</i>

36:15.806 --> 36:18.409
<i>Something about
a Mexican guy.</i>

36:18.442 --> 36:22.913
<i>I didn't mind it so
much, but your father...</i>

36:22.945 --> 36:26.317
<i>Really,
do you have to be so detailed?</i>

36:26.349 --> 36:29.118
<i>Why don't you write
children books?</i>

36:29.152 --> 36:32.789
I don't know,
why don't you join the Peace Corps?

36:32.822 --> 36:35.826
<i>I'm not gonna live in a hut.
Thank you.</i>

36:35.858 --> 36:37.427
<i>Of course
the card is good.</i>

36:37.460 --> 36:39.062
<i>Sorry, I'll be off
this call in a second.</i>

36:39.096 --> 36:40.630
<i>It's my daughter.</i>

36:45.768 --> 36:48.205
- Okay, bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

36:58.347 --> 37:00.717
Oh, yeah,
that was when I was 12,

37:00.751 --> 37:02.786
I took
my uncle's money

37:02.818 --> 37:04.320
and I went to
the bodega

37:04.353 --> 37:06.990
and just bought my
first dirty magazine.

37:08.025 --> 37:09.226
- What?
- Yeah.

37:09.259 --> 37:11.661
- You were 12?
- Yeah.

37:11.695 --> 37:13.163
- Twelve.
- Wow!

37:13.195 --> 37:17.735
Wow, You've always had it in
you, you naughty boy.

37:17.768 --> 37:19.470
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

37:19.503 --> 37:20.671
Oh, wait, hold on.

37:24.474 --> 37:25.343
Hi.

37:26.909 --> 37:29.245
What? No,
I paid that bill.

37:29.278 --> 37:30.347
All right.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.082
Oh, okay. Well,
I'm sorry they're harassing you.

37:32.114 --> 37:33.416
I'll take care of it.

37:34.483 --> 37:36.353
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go on.

37:37.353 --> 37:40.590
Soy milk, quinoa.
Uh-huh, anything else?

37:41.557 --> 37:42.358
No?

37:42.391 --> 37:44.094
All right. Yep, I got it. Cool.

37:44.126 --> 37:45.962
See you later. Bye.

37:47.797 --> 37:50.500
Did you have
to take that call?

37:50.534 --> 37:54.405
Well, we share expenses
and an apartment, so...

39:14.851 --> 39:16.253
This is my mother's.

39:55.257 --> 39:58.194
<i>I wanna
join you in Mexico.</i>

39:59.362 --> 40:01.597
<i>I could study
Spanish.</i>

40:01.630 --> 40:03.933
<i>We could make
some art together.</i>

40:03.967 --> 40:07.003
<i>I wish I could,
but I'll be pretty busy with work.</i>

40:07.036 --> 40:09.272
<i>My mother,
Victoria...</i>

40:33.563 --> 40:34.565
It's okay.

40:46.141 --> 40:47.910
<i>When Pedro
and I first met,</i>

40:47.943 --> 40:49.512
<i>he said,</i>

40:49.545 --> 40:53.516
<i>"When I love someone the first
thing I give them is freedom."</i>

40:53.550 --> 40:56.854
<i>Without him, I still have
freedom, but what of it?</i>

40:58.021 --> 40:59.923
<i>The advantage
of polyamory</i>

40:59.956 --> 41:02.059
<i>is if one relationship
falls apart,</i>

41:02.092 --> 41:04.161
<i>you're not
left stranded.</i>

41:04.193 --> 41:05.728
<i>Heartbreak
insurance means</i>

41:05.762 --> 41:08.798
<i>you can always be comforted
in the arms of another.</i>

41:09.900 --> 41:11.335
<i>But then,
you go to a party</i>

41:11.367 --> 41:14.103
<i>and you find
yourself alone,</i>

41:14.137 --> 41:16.673
<i>dying a little with
each stranger's touch.</i>

41:32.655 --> 41:33.757
Fuck.

41:40.496 --> 41:42.199
- <i>Veronica?</i>
- <i>Hi, Daniel.</i>

41:42.231 --> 41:44.233
Um, yeah. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

41:44.266 --> 41:46.168
I'm sorry it's so late...

41:46.202 --> 41:47.504
<i>What's going on?</i>

41:47.536 --> 41:52.542
I was at this party and I
was, uh, walking back.

41:52.576 --> 41:55.746
And, I mean, it was a weird
party, I had to leave.

41:55.778 --> 41:58.248
And now,
I don't know where the fuck I am,

41:58.280 --> 42:00.750
- and my phone's about to die.
- <i>Oh, no.</i>

42:01.518 --> 42:03.853
It doesn't feel safe.

42:03.887 --> 42:06.023
<i>Do you want to
come over?</i>

42:06.056 --> 42:07.724
<i>I'm house sitting
for a friend.</i>

42:07.757 --> 42:10.092
- <i>Kirsten's not here.</i>
- Are you sure?

42:10.126 --> 42:11.828
<i>Yeah. Yeah.
I'll come get you.</i>

42:11.860 --> 42:15.431
<i>Just wait there.
Drop a pin and I'll come get you.</i>

42:15.465 --> 42:16.300
Okay.

42:16.333 --> 42:17.501
Let me
get you some tea.

42:17.534 --> 42:20.871
I think he has
chamomile over here.

42:21.637 --> 42:24.307
Okay, so...

42:25.208 --> 42:26.343
Put...

42:40.923 --> 42:41.858
Here.

42:42.925 --> 42:44.027
Take this apricot.

42:44.059 --> 42:46.063
Just feel your
breath, okay?

42:46.096 --> 42:49.432
I know it seems like you can't
breathe, but you can.

43:22.931 --> 43:24.267
Here you go.

43:32.108 --> 43:33.844
I think, um...

43:35.010 --> 43:36.447
I think it's passing.

43:38.181 --> 43:39.548
Wow.

43:39.581 --> 43:40.951
Look at this.
Come on.

43:47.990 --> 43:49.293
They're brother
and sister.

44:13.182 --> 44:14.684
Tada, what do
you think?

44:15.918 --> 44:19.121
I need to hire you
as my personal chef.

44:19.155 --> 44:20.990
You are a goddess.

44:21.690 --> 44:22.558
All right.

44:23.059 --> 44:25.663
Um... dig in.

44:27.197 --> 44:29.333
Hey, hey, hey.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.536
Hmm.

44:32.568 --> 44:35.706
What's up, girl?
Hey, girl!

44:35.739 --> 44:37.875
- Aww, she needs a playmate.
- What?

44:39.175 --> 44:40.477
You should get
another cat.

44:41.344 --> 44:43.480
Yeah, but we have
a special bond.

44:43.512 --> 44:45.682
I don't want to lose
that to another kitty.

44:48.952 --> 44:50.054
That won't go away.

44:51.186 --> 44:52.655
It'll never go away.

44:52.688 --> 44:55.525
Right, cutie?

44:55.824 --> 44:56.726
Bye.

45:02.197 --> 45:03.900
Did you wash me
off you?

45:05.300 --> 45:08.105
Hmm, good question.
Let's check.

45:12.275 --> 45:13.577
Can you tell me?

45:19.916 --> 45:20.784
Hey.

45:23.253 --> 45:24.755
Where have you been?

45:24.788 --> 45:27.557
Uh, I had showings
all day in Harlem.

45:29.492 --> 45:31.695
I asked you to do
laundry three days ago.

45:32.394 --> 45:35.498
Well, I was
busy selling...

45:35.532 --> 45:38.702
trying to sell
apartments, so.

45:40.836 --> 45:42.940
You can at least pretend
like you still live here.

45:48.177 --> 45:50.279
<i>I don't know. It's like
I've been saying this for months,</i>

45:50.313 --> 45:51.782
but where are my needs?

45:51.815 --> 45:53.215
I mean, they're
not being met.

45:53.248 --> 45:54.984
It's not that hard
to meet them.

45:55.018 --> 45:57.686
I'm doing
the best I can.

45:57.719 --> 46:00.623
I mean, we haven't
had sex for months,

46:00.657 --> 46:01.958
- which sucks.
- Yeah.

46:01.990 --> 46:04.393
And then,
he wants to go to culinary school

46:04.427 --> 46:06.797
and we barely paid
rent last month.

46:06.829 --> 46:10.599
I rented a lot of shitty apartments
so you could pursue your dream.

46:10.632 --> 46:12.468
You know that, right?

46:12.501 --> 46:15.072
I get it.
You're having a midlife crisis.

46:17.407 --> 46:19.242
What...
But why should...

46:19.275 --> 46:22.311
Okay.

46:22.344 --> 46:24.113
Why should I
give up everything

46:24.146 --> 46:27.016
so you can just
keep struggling?

46:28.284 --> 46:29.586
I don't understand.

46:51.673 --> 46:54.777
Hey, how are you?
I've been thinking about you.

46:54.811 --> 46:56.513
<i>Not so well.</i>

46:56.545 --> 46:58.414
Oh.

46:58.447 --> 46:59.748
What's been going on?

46:59.782 --> 47:02.519
<i>Kirsten and I are
getting a divorce.</i>

47:04.853 --> 47:05.922
<i>Wow.</i>

47:07.123 --> 47:10.126
Feel like my soul has
been ripped out of me.

47:11.226 --> 47:13.896
Oh, yeah,
that's understandable.

47:13.929 --> 47:15.865
We were together
for 12 years.

47:16.766 --> 47:18.869
I don't know
how to be now.

47:18.902 --> 47:21.771
Like, who am I without
her, you know?

47:23.806 --> 47:25.775
Well, you're still you.

47:27.376 --> 47:28.744
I guess.

47:28.777 --> 47:31.247
- <i>Who is that?</i>
- It's my mom.

47:32.481 --> 47:34.250
I think you...

47:34.284 --> 47:37.988
You need to take sometime
to rediscover yourself,

47:38.021 --> 47:42.225
<i>and, um, maybe get out of
town for a little while.</i>

47:42.257 --> 47:44.493
You know, my parents,
they live in Connecticut,

47:44.527 --> 47:46.028
so, um,

47:46.061 --> 47:48.030
- <i>maybe you and I could...</i>
- Oh.

47:53.503 --> 47:55.238
- Sorry, is this a bad...
- Yeah...

47:57.172 --> 47:58.407
I'm so sorry.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.576
Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to...

48:03.646 --> 48:04.914
I'm so sorry,
I'll call you back.

48:05.414 --> 48:07.250
Okay. Bye.

49:36.972 --> 49:38.108
Hi, Dad.

49:40.809 --> 49:42.679
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Mm, hi.

49:44.414 --> 49:45.382
Hi.

49:47.884 --> 49:50.186
<i>This chicken is fabulous.</i>

49:50.219 --> 49:51.354
What is that,
sage?

49:51.387 --> 49:53.390
Yes, I thought I'd try
something a little adventurous

49:53.422 --> 49:55.891
since we're having a chef
dining with us tonight.

49:55.925 --> 49:58.327
Oh, no.
Chef-in-training.

49:58.360 --> 50:00.063
Yeah. Oh, mm.

50:00.096 --> 50:02.831
So, Daniel,
what's your background?

50:02.864 --> 50:04.567
Where are you
from, Daniel?

50:04.599 --> 50:07.269
Uh, Queens,
yeah, New York.

50:07.302 --> 50:10.339
But where are you really from,
where, you know, originally?

50:10.373 --> 50:11.441
My family is
from Korea,

50:11.474 --> 50:14.210
but I'm from Queens,
born and raised.

50:14.242 --> 50:15.445
Got you. Yeah.

50:16.112 --> 50:16.980
Yeah.

50:17.547 --> 50:18.715
Welcome.

50:21.384 --> 50:25.387
So, Luke, Veronica tells
me you work in finance.

50:25.420 --> 50:28.123
Hedge funds.
You invest?

50:28.157 --> 50:31.327
Oh, I would like to,
but I don't have anything to invest,

50:31.360 --> 50:33.963
- you know.
- You don't need a lot. Start small...

50:33.996 --> 50:36.666
- Very smart.
- ...try new emerging markets.

50:36.699 --> 50:37.934
Performance is
the key now,

50:37.967 --> 50:40.403
even more so than
liquidity or transparency.

50:40.436 --> 50:42.005
It's on the up
and up again now.

50:42.038 --> 50:44.574
After '08, we had
to sell a boat...

50:44.606 --> 50:46.710
- Yes.
- ...downsize to two cars...

50:48.043 --> 50:50.045
Anyway, what are you
up to these days?

50:50.079 --> 50:52.649
So many projects,
I can't keep up.

50:52.681 --> 50:54.716
- Um...
- There's your lust blog.

50:54.750 --> 50:56.552
Is it like Dan Savage?

50:56.585 --> 50:58.288
I listened to
his podcast once,

50:58.320 --> 50:59.855
He sounded really gay.

50:59.889 --> 51:01.124
Not to
change the subject,

51:01.157 --> 51:03.293
we're so happy Veronica
finally settled down.

51:03.326 --> 51:05.795
- We were concerned...
- What do you mean "concerned?"

51:05.827 --> 51:08.197
Well, you know,
about your "roommate situation".

51:09.231 --> 51:12.601
Well, Joanne was never
my roommate, Mom.

51:12.635 --> 51:14.403
Why didn't
you tell us?

51:14.436 --> 51:17.739
I don't know. I just didn't
think that you wanted to...

51:17.773 --> 51:18.842
Besides, it doesn't
matter now

51:18.875 --> 51:20.811
'cause you're
with Daniel.

51:22.010 --> 51:24.213
Yes. Well,
just because I'm with a man now

51:24.246 --> 51:25.848
doesn't mean
I'm heteronormative.

51:25.882 --> 51:27.083
Where do
get these words?

51:27.115 --> 51:28.384
Oh, come on.
Now, I'm insulted.

51:28.416 --> 51:31.353
What I mean is,
we're not a conventional couple.

51:31.387 --> 51:33.623
I mean,
sometimes we...

51:33.655 --> 51:35.958
- What?
- ...do things with other people.

51:35.992 --> 51:39.229
Wait a minute.
Are you saying you're swingers now?

51:39.262 --> 51:42.030
Oh, my God!
I saw a show about that.

51:42.063 --> 51:44.134
It's not exactly
swinging.

51:44.166 --> 51:47.971
Swinging is related,
but it's more like open relationships,

51:48.003 --> 51:49.005
you know, consensual.

51:49.038 --> 51:50.539
What, are you
polygamous or...

51:50.572 --> 51:52.574
No, we're
polyamorous.

51:52.608 --> 51:54.344
- What?
- Um...

51:54.376 --> 51:57.246
"Poly" coming from the
Greek meaning "many,"

51:57.280 --> 52:01.284
and "amory" or "amorous"
meaning "love."

52:01.317 --> 52:02.117
Yeah.

52:02.150 --> 52:04.820
- Oh.
- So, it means many loves.

52:04.853 --> 52:06.956
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

52:08.657 --> 52:11.460
You know, your mom and I were
invited to a key party once.

52:11.494 --> 52:14.864
- What?
- We didn't go, of course.

52:14.896 --> 52:16.965
Why not?
Why not?

52:16.998 --> 52:19.168
Please, let's not
even discuss it.

52:19.202 --> 52:21.404
- We're having dessert, right, Janet?
- Yeah.

52:21.436 --> 52:22.371
Yeah, there'll
be dessert.

52:22.405 --> 52:24.807
- Please, eat up more if you can.
- Okay.

52:25.474 --> 52:27.177
Yeah.

53:30.072 --> 53:32.576
- Hi, how are you, beautiful?
- Hey!

53:33.976 --> 53:35.744
- What's up, man?
- Yeah. Thank you.

53:35.777 --> 53:38.480
- This is your first time at Polly Cocktails?
- Yes.

53:42.985 --> 53:45.521
I think I've seen
most of you naked.

53:45.554 --> 53:46.556
Who's getting naked?

53:46.588 --> 53:47.923
Uh-uh. Not that
kinda party.

53:47.956 --> 53:49.259
Veronica already
told me well in advance.

53:49.291 --> 53:51.393
Daniel is
an amazing cook.

53:51.427 --> 53:53.262
Ooh!

53:53.295 --> 53:55.564
- Don't be modest.
- I'm not being modest.

53:55.597 --> 53:59.335
So, what have you been up to?
Any new projects?

53:59.367 --> 54:02.404
- Actually, have a seat.
- Yes.

54:02.438 --> 54:04.507
You know,
I love you two together.

54:05.740 --> 54:08.076
- I'm glad you came.
- Me, too.

54:08.110 --> 54:10.246
I'd love to see
more of you.

54:10.278 --> 54:12.081
- Yeah. You're right.
- Yeah.

54:12.114 --> 54:14.516
- Both of you, together.
- Me, too.

54:14.550 --> 54:16.653
- Actually, I'm working on a documentary.
- Yeah?

54:16.686 --> 54:18.421
Yeah. About poly.

54:18.454 --> 54:22.225
And I was thinking of you
as a possible subject.

54:23.125 --> 54:24.427
Me?

54:24.460 --> 54:27.797
Well, I wonder why.
I don't know anything about poly.

54:27.829 --> 54:30.500
Ah, come on, girl.

54:31.434 --> 54:35.238
- You're so gorgeous.
- You're so gorgeous.

54:35.271 --> 54:38.475
- Oh, yeah, hi. Daniel.
- I'm Jasmine.

54:39.307 --> 54:41.177
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:44.045 --> 54:45.547
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:46.916 --> 54:48.918
<i>When couples
talk about sharing,</i>

54:48.951 --> 54:53.655
<i>it usually doesn't include sex and
romantic love with other people.</i>

54:53.688 --> 54:59.161
<i>Anything that threatens to upset
the paradigm of two is risky.</i>

54:59.195 --> 55:03.199
<i>But, mutually adding a third
person to a relationship</i>

55:03.231 --> 55:07.804
<i>has the power to expand
the intimacy of sharing.</i>

55:07.836 --> 55:12.041
<i>Beyond the pleasure and
variety polyamory brings,</i>

55:12.074 --> 55:13.909
<i>it is enlightening
to see my partner</i>

55:13.943 --> 55:17.480
<i>through the desiring eyes
of someone else.</i>

55:17.512 --> 55:21.183
<i>When Maya laughs at Daniel's
jokes, I laugh, too,</i>

55:21.217 --> 55:24.287
<i>as if hearing them
for the first time.</i>

55:24.320 --> 55:27.691
<i>I see myself in her
wanting him</i>

55:28.490 --> 55:30.525
<i>and I want her more.</i>

55:30.559 --> 55:34.130
<i>Her desire reminds me
how desirable he is</i>

55:34.163 --> 55:36.599
<i>and I desire him more.</i>

55:36.632 --> 55:42.771
<i>For the first time, I believe that
three might be better than two.</i>

55:42.804 --> 55:44.172
- Shall we get dessert?
- Yes.

55:44.206 --> 55:45.875
Mm. Let's ask
for dessert.

55:45.907 --> 55:47.143
Hi.

55:47.909 --> 55:49.478
Let's just ask
for a check.

55:49.512 --> 55:50.380
I'll be right back.

55:52.882 --> 55:55.650
- Daniel.
- Kirsten, hey.

55:55.684 --> 55:57.086
What are you
doing here?

55:57.119 --> 55:59.389
I'm just here
with some friends.

55:59.422 --> 56:02.257
You don't have to put on that
act for my benefit anymore.

56:02.291 --> 56:05.161
Well, you didn't
want to know, so.

56:05.193 --> 56:06.862
I'm taking care
of the check.

56:06.896 --> 56:08.297
Oh, good. Good.

56:08.329 --> 56:10.432
- Hi, I'm Maya.
- Kirsten.

56:10.465 --> 56:11.400
Nice to meet you.

56:11.434 --> 56:13.669
- And this is Veronica.
- Hi.

56:13.702 --> 56:15.105
I know.

56:16.838 --> 56:17.840
We were
the perfect couple

56:17.873 --> 56:19.041
and we just couldn't
make it work.

56:19.074 --> 56:21.144
How are you gonna
do any better?

56:22.177 --> 56:23.712
Well, we're not
a couple.

56:23.746 --> 56:26.282
We're... a triad.

56:28.083 --> 56:29.719
It was nice
meeting you.

56:42.530 --> 56:43.799
Ooh.

56:48.838 --> 56:52.242
- What's your safe word?
- Kitten.

56:56.077 --> 56:57.346
Kneel.

58:22.831 --> 58:25.168
So, you saw Maya
on Saturday?

58:25.900 --> 58:28.003
Yeah. Uh, I went
to her place.

58:28.036 --> 58:30.372
So, we were gonna
go out to eat,

58:30.405 --> 58:34.110
but I was really horny,
so I kissed her

58:34.143 --> 58:36.679
and kinda nudged her
onto the bed.

58:37.146 --> 58:39.181
Mmm.

58:39.213 --> 58:44.119
So, you, uh...
before dinner?

58:44.152 --> 58:48.223
Yeah, yeah.
We had sex before dinner.

58:48.257 --> 58:50.126
- Yeah.
- Oh.

58:50.159 --> 58:52.894
Then we went to a Mexican
restaurant and we talked a lot.

58:52.927 --> 58:55.196
I didn't think we would
have so much in common.

58:55.230 --> 58:57.233
Um, did you know
she's divorced?

58:58.266 --> 59:00.802
No. No, I didn't
know that.

59:02.070 --> 59:03.438
Talked a lot
about you.

59:03.472 --> 59:05.641
I told you
to be present.

59:05.673 --> 59:06.976
I was present.

59:07.009 --> 59:09.545
I talked about you
because...

59:09.577 --> 59:11.646
you're an important
part of my life.

59:11.679 --> 59:13.114
Aww.

59:13.148 --> 59:15.550
Well, okay.
That's good.

59:15.583 --> 59:17.385
Yeah, I know.

59:17.418 --> 59:19.187
Yeah, and then we
went back to her place

59:19.221 --> 59:21.690
and, um,
we fucked again.

59:22.791 --> 59:24.260
And, uh...

59:26.128 --> 59:27.564
Was it good?

59:28.329 --> 59:29.898
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

59:29.931 --> 59:30.932
Yeah.

59:30.965 --> 59:33.536
And by then,
it was like 3:00 in the morning,

59:33.568 --> 59:35.737
and she said I could
sleepover if it was too late.

59:36.137 --> 59:37.440
So...

59:38.474 --> 59:41.344
That wasn't part
of our agreement.

59:41.376 --> 59:45.914
It was so late...
you know.

59:45.947 --> 59:48.717
I did leave early in the
morning, though. Come on.

59:51.686 --> 59:53.188
Okay.

59:53.222 --> 59:54.957
Yeah. I mean,
that's fine.

59:54.989 --> 59:56.192
- Right?
- Yeah.

59:56.224 --> 59:57.993
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:00:18.646 --> 01:00:20.682
- They look so happy.
- I know.

01:00:20.715 --> 01:00:22.317
Do you know how
long they've been together?

01:00:22.351 --> 01:00:25.421
- It's their 20th anniversary.
- Wow.

01:00:25.454 --> 01:00:27.123
That is so romantic.

01:00:27.155 --> 01:00:29.257
I wanna cry.
That is so beautiful.

01:00:29.291 --> 01:00:31.193
- Hello, hello.
- Hi!

01:00:31.226 --> 01:00:33.596
Veronica,
you remember our boyfriend Ted.

01:00:33.628 --> 01:00:34.697
Of course.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:37.333
- We go way back.
- Ah, yeah.

01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:41.871
So, how do you balance
it, the three of you?

01:00:42.403 --> 01:00:44.407
It balances itself.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.309
We communicate,
trust each other.

01:00:47.342 --> 01:00:48.978
I'm the luckiest man
in the world.

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:52.914
Well, with two gorgeous
partners, of course you are.

01:00:56.918 --> 01:00:58.453
There's my man.

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:03.291
Honey, are you
jealous?

01:01:03.324 --> 01:01:06.561
- No.
- It's okay to feel jealous.

01:01:06.594 --> 01:01:09.497
I know, I know.
But I'm not.

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:11.000
Maybe you need
to be more bold,

01:01:11.032 --> 01:01:13.868
you know,
if you want to move on the scales.

01:01:13.902 --> 01:01:17.974
- Tip the scales.
- Yes, tip the scales.

01:01:35.289 --> 01:01:37.960
You know, it's so nice to finally
have a real date with you.

01:01:39.393 --> 01:01:41.730
Thank you for
the opportunity.

01:01:49.704 --> 01:01:52.574
Wow.
The Healthy Hedonist.

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:54.977
What inspired you to put
those two things together?

01:01:56.311 --> 01:02:02.084
Um, well, you know
how you get high

01:02:02.117 --> 01:02:05.921
and have hours
of wild sex...

01:02:05.954 --> 01:02:08.758
- Mm-hmm.
- ...but then next day you do nothing,

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:11.994
you do nothing
but cleanse and fast

01:02:12.027 --> 01:02:14.396
and squeeze out
the toxins

01:02:14.429 --> 01:02:16.965
through yoga and meditation.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.135
Mm.

01:02:20.668 --> 01:02:21.569
Sort of.

01:02:21.603 --> 01:02:23.539
Sounds kind of
extreme, though.

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:28.176
I hear
what you're saying.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:29.978
But it's all
about balance.

01:02:32.213 --> 01:02:34.182
Yeah.

01:02:34.215 --> 01:02:37.318
Living into
your pleasure.

01:02:37.351 --> 01:02:40.522
I don't know, just being present
with what you're actually...

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:44.059
Sorry. Just give me one moment.

01:02:51.065 --> 01:02:53.769
You know poly people,
they're always checking in.

01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:55.570
Yeah.

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.976
I'm actually working
on a book, too.

01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:02.510
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:02.543 --> 01:03:05.446
- Well, what's it about?
- Well, it's a novel...

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.550
- Uh-hmm.
- ...and, um,

01:03:08.583 --> 01:03:14.123
it's about...
love and lust

01:03:14.155 --> 01:03:15.690
and...

01:03:16.657 --> 01:03:20.596
Stuff?

01:03:20.628 --> 01:03:22.464
Yeah, you know.

01:03:23.164 --> 01:03:24.666
Good for you.
Good for you.

01:03:24.699 --> 01:03:26.335
It's about
a lot of things.

01:03:26.367 --> 01:03:29.371
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

01:03:35.911 --> 01:03:39.014
Do you want to eat the
food before it gets cold?

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:41.250
Isn't that what
we're doing?

01:03:41.282 --> 01:03:43.351
Oh. Mmm.

01:03:51.559 --> 01:03:52.927
Okay. Okay.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.862
Food.

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.131
Yeah, food.

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:57.166
Oh, yeah.

01:04:18.052 --> 01:04:19.121
You're putting
that up?

01:04:20.021 --> 01:04:22.090
Yeah, yeah.
It's a good spot for it,

01:04:22.123 --> 01:04:24.659
so why not, right?

01:04:24.693 --> 01:04:27.263
Well, I mean,
look at it, Daniel.

01:04:27.295 --> 01:04:29.965
It's a very...
sensual,

01:04:30.532 --> 01:04:32.167
- intimate photo.
- Mm.

01:04:32.199 --> 01:04:34.002
And it's not small.

01:04:36.605 --> 01:04:38.708
Yeah. Okay.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.309
It might give her
the wrong idea

01:04:41.342 --> 01:04:42.443
if she comes
over here

01:04:42.476 --> 01:04:44.245
and she sees that,
you know.

01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:47.016
Uh, what wrong idea?
I don't...

01:04:47.048 --> 01:04:49.652
There are no photos
like that of me up here.

01:04:49.684 --> 01:04:52.855
I'm gonna have
to... you know,

01:04:52.887 --> 01:04:55.423
get some photos like that...
at least one.

01:04:55.456 --> 01:04:56.925
Come on, it's just a
gift, all right?

01:04:56.958 --> 01:04:58.426
Maya is
a generous person.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:04:59.595
Don't you like her?

01:04:59.628 --> 01:05:01.396
Of course I do,
she's my friend.

01:05:01.429 --> 01:05:03.097
I don't want to
see her get hurt.

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:12.641
- Hey, David.
- <i>Pizza delivery.</i>

01:05:12.673 --> 01:05:14.309
I'll ring you in
now, okay?

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.619
Uh, yeah.

01:05:23.652 --> 01:05:25.854
Did you know
that strawberries

01:05:25.887 --> 01:05:29.325
are from Brittany,
France, originally?

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:31.527
- Really?
- I did not know that.

01:05:31.559 --> 01:05:32.594
Yeah.

01:05:32.626 --> 01:05:34.362
Can I play a song
for you guys?

01:05:34.396 --> 01:05:35.764
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure.

01:05:35.797 --> 01:05:38.199
- Over there, you can plug it in.
- Okay.

01:05:39.534 --> 01:05:40.936
Isn't he sexy?

01:05:41.436 --> 01:05:42.738
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:05:46.974 --> 01:05:48.076
Mm-hmm.

01:05:57.885 --> 01:05:59.288
Oh.

01:06:02.224 --> 01:06:03.392
Oh.

01:06:14.735 --> 01:06:16.705
Mmm.

01:06:31.585 --> 01:06:33.188
Oh, yeah.

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.711
I just wanna
watch, okay?

01:07:09.157 --> 01:07:11.360
Do you want
me to keep going?

01:07:11.393 --> 01:07:13.494
Um...

01:07:13.527 --> 01:07:16.397
He just needs some
time, I think.

01:07:16.431 --> 01:07:18.266
You just need
some time, right?

01:07:20.235 --> 01:07:21.336
Yeah?

01:07:21.769 --> 01:07:23.405
- Uh...
- Yeah?

01:07:24.739 --> 01:07:26.041
You know,

01:07:26.074 --> 01:07:29.110
I don't think this is a good time.
Sorry, I just...

01:07:39.353 --> 01:07:42.424
- He's never been with a guy before.
- Mm.

01:07:43.824 --> 01:07:46.360
It really turns me on
to see you with a man.

01:07:46.393 --> 01:07:47.829
You understand
that, right?

01:07:47.862 --> 01:07:50.498
Yeah. But I felt like
you were pressuring me.

01:07:51.599 --> 01:07:52.967
Well, you were
really enjoying it

01:07:53.001 --> 01:07:55.171
before you got all in
your head about it.

01:07:56.505 --> 01:08:00.910
- Uh, what about your friend Jasmine?
- What about her?

01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:03.177
She's hot.

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:06.080
So, maybe we could,
uh, you know...

01:08:06.114 --> 01:08:08.750
Jasmine isn't taking
on any new lovers.

01:08:08.782 --> 01:08:10.219
Well, she's not
the only option.

01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:12.487
Well, neither are you.

01:08:21.429 --> 01:08:24.332
David just invited
me over to continue,

01:08:24.365 --> 01:08:25.835
if it's okay with you.

01:08:28.603 --> 01:08:29.703
Sure.

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.307
You have
my blessing.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:33.808
Okay.

01:09:29.863 --> 01:09:33.368
I don't know.
I just need a little break.

01:09:34.033 --> 01:09:35.837
Just a little break.

01:09:44.546 --> 01:09:45.948
You okay?

01:10:11.573 --> 01:10:13.041
<i>Nice space.</i>

01:10:13.073 --> 01:10:15.409
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Wow.</i>

01:10:15.443 --> 01:10:19.480
So, we got an HBO writer
just down the hall.

01:10:20.414 --> 01:10:23.851
That's Spike Lee's
assistant's office, yeah.

01:10:23.885 --> 01:10:26.021
Oh, these are
the Barrys!

01:10:26.054 --> 01:10:28.155
Barry R, Barry S.

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:30.626
You want to put a camera
on me and my partners?

01:10:31.893 --> 01:10:33.494
We can work out
the approach.

01:10:34.328 --> 01:10:37.198
How true to life
do you want it?

01:10:37.231 --> 01:10:40.034
As true as
you want it to be.

01:10:40.068 --> 01:10:43.238
You already have the
following with your blog,

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:46.175
this is gonna take you
on a whole other level.

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:51.413
Think about it, hmm?

01:10:51.445 --> 01:10:53.715
<i>Although I had
reservations at first,</i>

01:10:53.747 --> 01:10:57.152
<i>I can't edit what I do
or say like I do here.</i>

01:10:57.185 --> 01:10:59.354
<i>My lovers gave me
their consent.</i>

01:10:59.386 --> 01:11:04.125
<i>And besides, how could I
refuse to expand and inspire?</i>

01:11:04.158 --> 01:11:06.360
<i>So, I'm going
on camera!</i>

01:11:06.394 --> 01:11:09.530
<i>And I can't wait to
tell you all about it.</i>

01:11:10.864 --> 01:11:12.934
What's your
ideal poly relationship

01:11:12.966 --> 01:11:14.369
or relationships?

01:11:15.837 --> 01:11:18.240
Well, since
I'm bisexual,

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:21.610
I used to think
that, ideally,

01:11:21.643 --> 01:11:24.078
I wanted one
male partner

01:11:24.112 --> 01:11:26.047
and one
female partner,

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:28.216
and those relationships
would be equal.

01:11:28.248 --> 01:11:33.121
Um, but now, well, more
recently, I've been feeling like

01:11:33.154 --> 01:11:36.992
I ideally want a
primary relationship,

01:11:37.024 --> 01:11:39.126
um, regardless
of gender.

01:11:39.159 --> 01:11:42.630
And that,
with that person,

01:11:42.663 --> 01:11:43.965
I would share,

01:11:43.997 --> 01:11:46.967
well, we would
share, um,

01:11:47.001 --> 01:11:50.838
you know, exploring
with other people.

01:11:50.872 --> 01:11:54.543
And, um, because...

01:11:55.676 --> 01:11:57.445
you know, I think
it's important

01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:04.686
to have a solid
foundation with someone.

01:12:04.719 --> 01:12:09.056
And it just seems easier to
have that with one person,

01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:13.828
um, and then to...

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:16.898
you know,
and then build from there,

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:18.799
yeah, like a house.

01:12:18.832 --> 01:12:20.067
You know, you have
the foundation

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.304
and then you want to add
the extensions later.

01:12:24.271 --> 01:12:25.407
Yeah.

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:42.690
What's the most
challenging part of being poly?

01:12:45.092 --> 01:12:48.997
You know,
I was wondering if you...

01:12:49.029 --> 01:12:52.733
The next time,
before you see Daniel...

01:12:52.766 --> 01:12:55.636
- Mm-hmm.
- Um,

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:58.440
can you check in
with me?

01:13:06.046 --> 01:13:07.782
Daniel is so...

01:13:10.885 --> 01:13:13.155
Okay.

01:13:14.756 --> 01:13:16.325
I have to admit,

01:13:17.225 --> 01:13:18.693
the first time,

01:13:18.725 --> 01:13:21.796
it was just the pleasure
of being with someone

01:13:21.829 --> 01:13:24.500
who intimately
knows you.

01:13:25.966 --> 01:13:28.436
- Huh.
- Hmm, what?

01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:33.274
Hmm, that,
um...

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:36.378
- You are so beautiful.
- Okay.

01:13:38.179 --> 01:13:40.282
I mean, is that a yes
to checking in?

01:13:40.314 --> 01:13:42.350
You know,
Daniel is...

01:13:44.618 --> 01:13:46.121
Yeah, he's amazing.

01:13:46.154 --> 01:13:47.556
He's something.

01:13:49.657 --> 01:13:51.493
I wasn't going to
say anything before,

01:13:51.525 --> 01:13:53.127
but he is...

01:13:53.161 --> 01:13:55.063
I don't think
he's ready for this.

01:13:55.095 --> 01:13:56.497
And I know you guys
have a relationship,

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:59.234
I want to respect
those boundaries,

01:13:59.266 --> 01:14:01.936
and I know he's your primary
partner, I get that.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:06.440
I have come to peace with
that, I've settled with that,

01:14:06.474 --> 01:14:09.110
- I'm fine with that.
- Uh-huh.

01:14:14.248 --> 01:14:16.150
You understand?
You see it, right?

01:14:16.984 --> 01:14:18.353
Um...

01:14:18.386 --> 01:14:21.123
He has this, like,
baby in a candy store kinda thing.

01:14:21.956 --> 01:14:24.493
- Yeah.
- It's kinda scary.

01:14:28.762 --> 01:14:29.930
That doesn't
scare me.

01:14:29.963 --> 01:14:31.567
- No?
- No.

01:14:34.769 --> 01:14:36.171
You know,

01:14:36.203 --> 01:14:38.472
my lover Chris is supposed
to come over later,

01:14:38.506 --> 01:14:40.242
and I haven't seen
him in a few months.

01:14:40.274 --> 01:14:44.879
So, I just want to
conserve my energy.

01:14:46.547 --> 01:14:48.949
Yeah, I've been touring
so many different places.

01:14:48.983 --> 01:14:50.652
- Yeah.
- Busy, busy, busy.

01:14:50.685 --> 01:14:53.054
- So, you understand, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:53.087 --> 01:14:55.190
Yeah, so, you want
me to go?

01:14:55.222 --> 01:14:56.457
Thank you.

01:14:56.957 --> 01:14:57.893
Um...

01:14:58.626 --> 01:15:00.061
Okay.

01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:02.764
- Are you... You're okay?
- Yeah, okay.

01:15:02.796 --> 01:15:04.064
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:15:04.097 --> 01:15:06.301
Okay. You don't have
to go right now.

01:16:21.309 --> 01:16:22.444
Do you mind?

01:16:39.159 --> 01:16:40.528
Do you know how?

01:16:41.194 --> 01:16:43.631
- Here.
- Uh, no idea.

01:16:44.599 --> 01:16:46.034
Okay. Put your arm... Wait.

01:16:46.067 --> 01:16:47.668
Put your arm
through there.

01:16:48.802 --> 01:16:50.037
Um...

01:16:53.173 --> 01:16:54.908
No.

01:16:54.942 --> 01:16:56.811
Put your arm
through this one.

01:16:57.377 --> 01:16:59.014
Put your
head through.

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:03.551
Yeah.

01:17:05.118 --> 01:17:06.587
Uh...

01:17:12.859 --> 01:17:13.929
There.

01:17:17.731 --> 01:17:18.899
Yeah.

01:17:20.534 --> 01:17:22.470
- Hey.
- Hey, welcome.

01:17:24.471 --> 01:17:27.274
Oh, ho-ho!

01:17:27.307 --> 01:17:28.643
- Look at you!
- You like it?

01:17:28.676 --> 01:17:31.780
Lookin' like a sexy,
Asian Satan.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:34.582
I like that.
I'm getting nervous, man.

01:17:34.614 --> 01:17:37.851
It's a big night.
It's a big night!

01:17:40.787 --> 01:17:44.425
- Hey, you guys look great.
- You look great.

01:17:46.359 --> 01:17:48.829
Okay, everyone.
Why don't we go around,

01:17:48.863 --> 01:17:51.231
say your names and a
little bit about yourself?

01:17:51.265 --> 01:17:53.435
- So, who's starting?
- I will.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:55.737
Hi. I'm Jasmine.

01:17:55.770 --> 01:17:58.339
I lost my virginity
in a threesome

01:17:58.372 --> 01:18:01.109
and it was amazing!

01:18:01.141 --> 01:18:04.046
<i>I was like,
"I don't wanna be a nun anymore."</i>

01:18:06.814 --> 01:18:09.150
The journey
to get to where I...

01:18:09.182 --> 01:18:11.853
where I am now.
Oh, I'm nervous.

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:16.824
Oh, Maya. Hi, I'm Maya.
Maya's my name.

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:18.560
Um,

01:18:18.592 --> 01:18:21.863
I feel really grateful that
I got to choose this life.

01:18:21.895 --> 01:18:25.634
You know,
whether I have one lover or five.

01:18:32.472 --> 01:18:34.708
I had no idea
this world existed,

01:18:34.742 --> 01:18:36.811
but I met Veronica
and she opened me up.

01:18:36.844 --> 01:18:39.814
She helped me discover
that ethical non-monogamy

01:18:39.846 --> 01:18:43.317
isn't just about swapping
partners or free love,

01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:48.255
it's female driven,
generous and inclusive.

01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:51.091
All right, you're up, girl.
Come on, now.

01:18:51.125 --> 01:18:53.595
Hi, I'm Veronica.

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:56.530
I don't know
why I'm here.

01:18:56.564 --> 01:18:59.400
She's a funny one.

01:18:59.432 --> 01:19:01.802
No matter how
careful you are,

01:19:01.836 --> 01:19:04.472
someone always
ends up getting hurt.

01:19:06.106 --> 01:19:07.576
Ay, Veronica.

01:19:11.311 --> 01:19:14.282
I'm Teddy.
I'm polyamorous,

01:19:14.314 --> 01:19:15.783
and It works for me.

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:21.556
Hey, why didn't you
acknowledge me?

01:19:21.588 --> 01:19:23.057
I'm here as
your partner.

01:19:39.707 --> 01:19:40.742
May I?

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.855
Oh!

01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:17.813
One.

01:20:19.747 --> 01:20:20.949
Two.

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:24.552
Three.

01:20:25.519 --> 01:20:26.655
Four.

01:20:28.421 --> 01:20:29.823
Five.

01:20:29.856 --> 01:20:32.226
Six, seven, eight...

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.195
Okay, red.

01:20:37.765 --> 01:20:40.568
- Nine, ten, eleven.
- Red! Red! Hey!

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.069
Hey, hey, hey.

01:20:44.404 --> 01:20:45.606
What's wrong with you?

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.508
What the hell was
that all about?

01:20:47.541 --> 01:20:50.045
- We were playing.
- That was not playing.

01:22:22.235 --> 01:22:23.337
Hey.

01:22:24.471 --> 01:22:28.009
Oh.
You still got your...

01:22:28.042 --> 01:22:29.210
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:22:29.243 --> 01:22:31.479
- ...smoky eyes.
- Just haven't had any time

01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:34.481
to get rid of it, so.

01:22:34.515 --> 01:22:36.517
What is this place?

01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:38.353
It was late and I
needed to be alone,

01:22:38.386 --> 01:22:40.254
so Benton
hooked me up.

01:22:40.287 --> 01:22:43.992
Yeah, it's unrented,
so he said I could crash here.

01:22:48.194 --> 01:22:49.063
Mm-hmm.

01:22:50.698 --> 01:22:52.066
Oh, are you hungry?

01:22:52.099 --> 01:22:53.634
I just ordered this.

01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:56.504
- No.
- Oh, I meant this.

01:22:56.537 --> 01:22:59.574
Oh, no. Um, where's
the bathroom?

01:22:59.606 --> 01:23:02.344
Ah, it's the first
door to your right.

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:19.060
You said you needed
to be alone.

01:23:24.832 --> 01:23:27.235
Yes...

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:29.337
but I met
someone else.

01:23:30.503 --> 01:23:31.672
At Chemistry?

01:23:32.372 --> 01:23:34.574
Uh, no, after.
She's sweet.

01:23:34.608 --> 01:23:37.311
I've never been with
a sex worker before.

01:23:47.621 --> 01:23:49.190
You paid her for sex?

01:23:49.689 --> 01:23:51.024
Yeah, she's smart.

01:23:51.057 --> 01:23:53.694
She's working her way
through college.

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.435
I have nothing
against sex workers,

01:24:00.467 --> 01:24:02.235
but what the fuck,
Daniel?

01:24:02.269 --> 01:24:04.806
What? You never said
it was out of bounds.

01:24:06.539 --> 01:24:08.408
So, this is
my fault now?

01:24:08.442 --> 01:24:11.412
I give you freedom and this
is what you do with it.

01:24:11.444 --> 01:24:13.113
Well, I finally
have freedom,

01:24:13.146 --> 01:24:15.882
- and now you want to take it away.
- No.

01:24:15.916 --> 01:24:17.784
Yeah, that's what
you're doing right now.

01:24:17.818 --> 01:24:19.087
No!

01:24:19.119 --> 01:24:21.788
But monogamy is obsolete, okay?
You know that.

01:24:21.822 --> 01:24:24.192
No, I never, I never said that.
I never said that.

01:24:24.225 --> 01:24:26.494
You're not saying that,
but that's what you're doing, okay?

01:24:26.527 --> 01:24:27.694
Monogamy is obsolete.

01:24:27.728 --> 01:24:29.364
- Polyamory is the future.
- What?

01:24:30.597 --> 01:24:32.966
This, this is not poly.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.002
This... There are
no boundaries here.

01:24:35.034 --> 01:24:36.104
Where are
the boundaries?

01:24:36.136 --> 01:24:37.871
Boundaries?
What about compersion?

01:24:37.904 --> 01:24:40.173
- What... What...
- Compersion? Fuck compersion!

01:24:40.207 --> 01:24:42.276
- What you did to Maya...
- Maya?

01:24:42.309 --> 01:24:44.846
Maya. What I did to
Maya was not cool,

01:24:44.878 --> 01:24:46.847
- but, but that...
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:49.917
Look, she was not being my
friend, okay?

01:24:49.949 --> 01:24:54.755
And that has nothing to do
with you and me right now.

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:57.257
I love you.

01:24:59.126 --> 01:25:00.128
I do, too.

01:25:12.573 --> 01:25:13.775
Okay.

01:25:16.143 --> 01:25:17.078
Hey...

01:25:20.314 --> 01:25:23.118
- I'm sorry. Just look...
- Don't touch me!

01:25:40.167 --> 01:25:43.738
Look, I can give you
threesomes and parties

01:25:43.770 --> 01:25:45.005
and...

01:25:46.673 --> 01:25:48.810
we can do
things together.

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:50.945
We can have
all of that

01:25:50.978 --> 01:25:54.349
if you could just...
love me.

01:26:44.965 --> 01:26:47.635
Yeah, I mean,
for me...

01:26:47.667 --> 01:26:50.070
like, with all
my poly experience,

01:26:50.104 --> 01:26:54.576
I've never...
let go of...

01:26:56.810 --> 01:26:59.180
my romantic
view of love.

01:27:00.079 --> 01:27:02.917
Is it possible
to love...

01:27:02.949 --> 01:27:05.051
like, openly,
totally openly

01:27:05.085 --> 01:27:07.654
and with
vulnerability

01:27:07.688 --> 01:27:10.391
and with
abandon...

01:27:11.692 --> 01:27:14.162
when you have
multiple lovers, I...

01:27:15.762 --> 01:27:17.163
sometimes I think,
yes, of course,

01:27:17.197 --> 01:27:21.301
<i>but other times,
I'm not so sure.</i>

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:27.108
Which is why I think polyamory
is just as fucked up as monogamy.

01:27:35.349 --> 01:27:38.086
You are the most engaging...

01:31:10.796 --> 01:31:12.165
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:31:15.735 --> 01:31:16.770
How are you?

01:31:17.136 --> 01:31:18.238
Good.

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.375
Mmm, Daniel,

01:31:22.408 --> 01:31:24.978
I've never been disappointed
in your cooking.

01:31:25.011 --> 01:31:26.279
There you go.

01:31:28.515 --> 01:31:29.850
- So, how's the...
- ...book?

01:31:29.882 --> 01:31:31.351
Killin' it.

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:35.690
Book is going well.

01:31:37.123 --> 01:31:39.193
Yeah, it's, um...

01:31:40.159 --> 01:31:42.395
I realized
sometimes it...

01:31:43.095 --> 01:31:44.331
it...

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:46.233
A story needs
separation

01:31:46.265 --> 01:31:48.301
from the thing
that inspired it...

01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:51.838
to start to really
make sense.

01:31:57.677 --> 01:31:58.578
Yeah.

01:32:00.581 --> 01:32:02.382
Do you still
go to parties?

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:05.118
Oh, not as often.

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:08.221
Um, I'm dating someone
now, actually.

01:32:11.958 --> 01:32:13.226
Do I know her?

01:32:14.461 --> 01:32:15.529
No.

01:32:15.561 --> 01:32:17.765
But I think you'd
like her, though.

01:32:19.231 --> 01:32:20.667
How's it working out?

01:32:22.735 --> 01:32:23.970
We're really happy.

01:32:24.904 --> 01:32:25.773
Uh...

01:32:25.805 --> 01:32:28.708
Yeah.
I go to the city when I can,

01:32:28.742 --> 01:32:31.679
and she comes up here
a couple of times.

01:32:34.247 --> 01:32:35.349
Hmm.

01:33:03.909 --> 01:33:05.445
You have someone.

01:33:07.948 --> 01:33:10.250
Yes,
but she's married.

01:33:10.283 --> 01:33:11.852
And it'll never go
beyond what we...

01:33:11.885 --> 01:33:13.119
You...

01:33:13.153 --> 01:33:15.957
you were married when we
met, remember?

01:33:24.096 --> 01:33:26.367
Would you ever...

01:33:26.399 --> 01:33:29.269
...under
the right circumstances,

01:33:31.171 --> 01:33:34.307
want to try
again with me?

01:33:35.007 --> 01:33:36.610
What circumstances?

01:33:38.110 --> 01:33:41.815
You and I were never really a
couple, Daniel. We...

01:33:43.917 --> 01:33:47.354
There was always
something or someone...

01:33:47.386 --> 01:33:48.822
between us.

01:33:51.057 --> 01:33:52.827
Besides, um...

01:33:54.427 --> 01:33:56.296
I'm seeing
someone, too.

01:33:58.364 --> 01:34:00.501
She's a writer
from New York,

01:34:03.737 --> 01:34:04.805
loves cats.
