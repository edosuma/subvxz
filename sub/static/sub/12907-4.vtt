Ladies, open your hearts to your suitor,

00:04.089 --> 00:05.255
Darius Beck!

00:05.290 --> 00:06.789
Shh. Network president.

00:06.824 --> 00:08.023
He's black.

00:08.060 --> 00:09.725
He's football black.

00:09.761 --> 00:10.893
What about this scandal?

00:10.929 --> 00:11.894
He called that reporter a bitch.

00:11.930 --> 00:13.295
Bitch, please.

00:13.330 --> 00:14.463
Chet? But what the
hell are you doing here?

00:14.498 --> 00:15.965
I'm taking my kingdom back.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.433
If I keep following
you around like this,

00:17.468 --> 00:18.634
the crew's gonna have a really hard time

00:18.670 --> 00:19.969
believing I'm the showrunner.

00:20.004 --> 00:21.704
I just got to steer us
past this train wreck,

00:21.739 --> 00:23.973
and then I will hand
the show back to you.

00:24.008 --> 00:25.274
Who's in charge here?

00:25.309 --> 00:26.776
- I am.
- I am.

00:26.811 --> 00:28.143
My two bosses, they're making

00:28.179 --> 00:29.744
two different versions of the show.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.413
I can't produce it with them on the set.

00:31.449 --> 00:34.483
Rachel wanted me to let her
run the show all by herself.

00:34.518 --> 00:35.984
That's why Coleman's here.

00:36.019 --> 00:37.553
You don't need Quinn.

00:37.588 --> 00:39.421
Between you and me, we can make shows

00:39.457 --> 00:40.822
that actually mean something.

00:40.857 --> 00:42.424
So you're the one who's
calling me "Hot Rachel."

00:42.460 --> 00:43.959
Well, you do kind of look like her.

00:43.994 --> 00:45.760
Tell me what the judge
said about the custody.

00:45.796 --> 00:46.795
Give me a little good news.

00:46.830 --> 00:48.262
You look amazing.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.230
Can we talk for a second?

00:49.265 --> 00:50.164
Absolutely.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.399
You lied about everything.

00:51.434 --> 00:52.567
Goodbye, Brandi. We're done.

00:54.037 --> 00:55.804
Darius, it's Rachel.

00:55.839 --> 00:56.771
Yeah. Come in.

00:56.807 --> 00:58.006
You okay?

00:58.041 --> 01:00.241
Shut the door.

01:00.276 --> 01:02.943
All right, has anybody
seen my messenger?

01:03.099 --> 01:03.966
Nothing yet, boss.

01:04.075 --> 01:06.247
Great, can you please just let
me know the second it arrives?

01:06.282 --> 01:07.448
I need it, like, yesterday.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.449
Copy that.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.284
- Rachel.
- Yeah.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.752
Did you see these things?

01:11.787 --> 01:13.590
Chet ordered them when
he was still in charge.

01:13.590 --> 01:14.155
What are those things?

01:14.190 --> 01:15.490
Hello? Powder-puff football date.

01:15.525 --> 01:17.091
It's supposed to be the girls' uniforms,

01:17.127 --> 01:19.126
but it's definitely gonna
look like a porn shoot,

01:19.161 --> 01:20.494
and there's a reporter

01:20.529 --> 01:21.695
from Entertainment Weekly on set today.

01:21.731 --> 01:23.130
Okay.

01:23.165 --> 01:24.164
What, seriously?

01:24.199 --> 01:24.898
So, it's just me then?

01:24.898 --> 01:27.300
Your feminist sensibilities
aren't offended by these things?

01:27.336 --> 01:29.703
No. Not today.

01:29.739 --> 01:30.971
Who are you?

01:31.007 --> 01:32.673
What would Hillary say, Rachel?

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.258 --> 01:50.765
Can't believe you're still
driving that thing.

01:50.789 --> 01:51.532
Why not?

01:51.532 --> 01:52.792
What, you want to take it for a spin?

01:52.827 --> 01:54.160
I'm still waiting to open her up,

01:54.195 --> 01:55.561
see how fast she goes.

01:55.596 --> 01:56.663
What, do you actually
want to watch Quinn

01:56.698 --> 01:58.297
turn into Naomi Campbell,

01:58.332 --> 02:01.000
because she's seriously
gonna beat the crap out of me.

02:01.036 --> 02:02.501
Don't worry about Quinn.

02:02.537 --> 02:05.404
- You've outgrown her.
- Note taken.

02:05.439 --> 02:07.173
Entertainment Weekly's here, by the way.

02:07.208 --> 02:08.473
Nice. All right.

02:08.508 --> 02:10.008
I'm gonna go pull some clips for them.

02:10.044 --> 02:11.310
Meet me inside in five?

02:11.345 --> 02:12.811
Three.

02:17.518 --> 02:19.818
Dan, can you please let me
know when the messenger arrives?

02:19.853 --> 02:20.852
Copy that, boss.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.424
Go away.

02:26.459 --> 02:27.826
I brought you Raisin Bran

02:27.861 --> 02:29.995
- without any raisins in it and...
- What?

02:33.233 --> 02:35.701
I brought you Raisin
Bran without the raisins

02:35.736 --> 02:37.335
and Lucky Charms without the charms.

02:37.370 --> 02:38.603
Oh, I didn't ask for that.

02:38.638 --> 02:41.172
Um, I-I just thought

02:41.208 --> 02:44.108
maybe you would need
it or want it. Um...

02:44.143 --> 02:46.578
I'm sorry, are you
trying to say something?

02:46.613 --> 02:48.179
Then just speak.

02:49.782 --> 02:50.702
Well, you weren't answering

02:50.702 --> 02:53.284
your phone, so they started
calling the production office

02:53.320 --> 02:54.785
and said about y-your dad.

02:55.328 --> 02:56.839
Christ. I'll deal with him later.

02:56.839 --> 02:57.858
He's dead.

02:59.759 --> 03:02.259
Your dad.

03:07.399 --> 03:08.999
Just get out.

03:10.770 --> 03:11.969
Get out!

03:31.623 --> 03:32.515
Oh, my God.

03:32.515 --> 03:34.124
Why... Why is there a baby here?

03:34.159 --> 03:36.492
It's bring your baby to work day.

03:36.527 --> 03:38.261
I'm sorry, did you, like,
kill Cynthia or something?

03:38.296 --> 03:39.729
No, I didn't kill my ex-wife.

03:39.765 --> 03:40.797
I didn't kill her.

03:40.832 --> 03:42.265
She's at a Deepak Chopra retreat.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.566
I gave the nanny the day off.

03:43.601 --> 03:44.834
It was time for some skin-to-skin

03:44.870 --> 03:46.236
pheromonal bonding time.

03:46.271 --> 03:47.639
I thought that there
was this whole, like,

03:47.639 --> 03:48.556
legal custody

03:48.556 --> 03:49.856
No.

03:49.856 --> 03:50.793
Battle thing, which you lost.

03:50.794 --> 03:52.841
Legal schmegal. No, this is my DNA.

03:52.877 --> 03:54.677
This is my legacy on Earth, okay?

03:54.712 --> 03:56.779
I'd like to see some judge
try and take that away from me.

03:56.814 --> 03:58.247
It's not gonna happen.

03:58.283 --> 03:59.582
You'd have to pull my
teeth and melt my bones.

03:59.617 --> 04:01.284
Okay, can you please just keep the baby

04:01.319 --> 04:02.285
away from the girls?

04:02.320 --> 04:03.652
It's like lady catnip.

04:06.290 --> 04:09.191
Madison, what are you doing?

04:09.226 --> 04:10.692
Quinn's always gonna remember me

04:10.727 --> 04:12.327
as the girl who went down on her fiancÃ©

04:12.362 --> 04:14.296
and told her that her dad was dead.

04:14.331 --> 04:16.300
Quinn's dad died?

04:16.300 --> 04:17.298
Yeah.

04:17.334 --> 04:19.543
I think she was just
starting to like me.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.272
She wasn't, Madison.

04:38.554 --> 04:40.321
Quinn.

04:41.524 --> 04:43.390
Hey, just, um...

04:43.426 --> 04:45.293
I just wanted to come
by and say that I'm sorry

04:45.328 --> 04:48.662
that your... that your dad died.

04:48.698 --> 04:51.199
Oh, that's what you're sorry about?

04:51.234 --> 04:52.633
Not Gary?

04:55.871 --> 04:57.805
Okay, so, now's not the time.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.206
Oh, it's the perfect time.

04:59.241 --> 05:01.141
I mean, actually, the perfect time

05:01.176 --> 05:03.210
would've been before
you went to the network,

05:03.245 --> 05:05.312
but now will have to do.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.423
I had a conversation with Gary.

05:17.459 --> 05:19.726
Go on.

05:19.761 --> 05:22.362
It's just that you gave
me the showrunner job

05:22.397 --> 05:24.064
and essentially took it away.

05:24.099 --> 05:25.765
So you stabbed me in the back?

05:25.800 --> 05:27.333
No, I went to talk to Gary,

05:27.369 --> 05:29.001
somebody who could be objective,

05:29.036 --> 05:31.203
somebody that could be
reasonable and cool headed.

05:31.239 --> 05:33.840
Stabbed me in the back.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.041
Okay, no, I just...

05:36.077 --> 05:38.944
No, I was just trying to
do what's best for the show.

05:38.980 --> 05:40.680
Now, that's bullshit.

05:40.715 --> 05:41.947
It was a power grab.

05:41.983 --> 05:43.115
At least have the balls to own it.

05:43.150 --> 05:44.583
No, it wasn't.

05:44.618 --> 05:45.851
I was just freaked out

05:45.887 --> 05:47.853
because our show was going down.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.521
Okay, well, your little freakout

05:49.556 --> 05:51.690
is the reason why that pre-teen dirt bag

05:51.725 --> 05:53.425
is driving around a sports car

05:53.460 --> 05:55.094
with the name of my show on it.

05:55.129 --> 05:56.528
They would've never sent him in

05:56.563 --> 05:59.063
if you didn't tattletale
to the principal.

05:59.099 --> 06:00.932
And now we're stuck with him.

06:00.967 --> 06:04.936
So, just go away, okay?

06:04.971 --> 06:06.938
You have a new boss.

06:06.973 --> 06:08.673
Stop acting like you care about me.

06:14.815 --> 06:16.047
I do care.

06:16.082 --> 06:18.182
You have a funny way of showing it.

06:20.453 --> 06:22.620
You know, I plucked you from nothing,

06:22.655 --> 06:24.755
made you a producer.

06:24.791 --> 06:29.928
And now you think you can
just do this all on your own.

06:29.963 --> 06:31.229
Well, you can't.

06:32.665 --> 06:36.934
'Cause the truth is,
you need me behind you,

06:36.969 --> 06:39.737
guiding you, pushing you,

06:39.772 --> 06:41.806
propping you up so you don't crack.

06:43.776 --> 06:47.010
But you'll always crack, Rachel.

06:47.046 --> 06:50.780
You're unstable and ungrateful,

06:50.816 --> 06:53.850
and you cannot make
this show without me.

06:53.885 --> 06:56.886
Rachel, your delivery's here.

06:59.458 --> 07:02.259
Watch me.

07:04.029 --> 07:06.663
I'll have you come right here.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.930
Took you long enough.

07:15.006 --> 07:17.139
You know what, can you
just freeze right there?

07:20.479 --> 07:22.144
All right, there you go.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.480
You don't have much time, so

07:24.515 --> 07:25.781
Yeah, thank you.

07:25.816 --> 07:26.949
Good to see you, doc.

07:26.985 --> 07:28.351
Good to see you, too, buddy.

07:31.990 --> 07:33.189
What the hell is she doing here?

07:33.924 --> 07:34.991
She knows. It's cool.

07:35.026 --> 07:36.392
It's not cool.

07:36.427 --> 07:38.460
One word about his injury
gets out to the press,

07:38.496 --> 07:39.728
- and his career's over.
- Okay.

07:39.763 --> 07:41.329
What the hell were you thinking, D?

07:41.365 --> 07:44.933
How else was the doc
gonna get in without her?

07:50.273 --> 07:54.876
Today on "Everlasting,"
it is powder-puff football.

07:54.911 --> 07:58.179
The ladies will hit the turf
in their pinks versus blues,

07:58.215 --> 08:00.515
and Darius is suiting up to
play quarterback on both sides,

08:00.550 --> 08:01.883
but the stakes are high

08:01.918 --> 08:03.351
because the winning team

08:03.387 --> 08:05.753
gets that winning date with our prince.

08:05.788 --> 08:07.489
Cue the ladies.

08:08.137 --> 08:09.924
Go this way, ladies.

08:16.298 --> 08:19.066
- This is ridiculous.
- Right?

08:19.101 --> 08:20.501
I mean, where's our romantic

08:20.537 --> 08:22.670
helicopter ride around a volcano?

08:22.705 --> 08:25.205
And besides, we're kind
of in our underwear again.

08:25.241 --> 08:27.341
Works out fine when you look like me.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.043
Rachel, where the hell is Darius?

08:29.078 --> 08:31.378
I've got a field full of
horny straight girls here

08:31.414 --> 08:33.212
and Graham is the only dick in sight.

08:33.249 --> 08:35.249
It is not a good situation.

08:35.284 --> 08:37.751
No one is having fun,
Rachel. Where is he?

08:37.785 --> 08:39.619
Yeah, he'll be there as soon as he can.

08:39.655 --> 08:41.054
It's bad.

08:41.090 --> 08:42.688
You put this off, and it's gotten worse.

08:42.724 --> 08:44.024
Well, can you just, like, give him

08:44.058 --> 08:45.458
something for the pain for right now?

08:45.493 --> 08:46.893
He needs the pain

08:46.929 --> 08:49.095
to tell him when he's
done damage to himself.

08:50.799 --> 08:53.466
It's time, D. You need surgery.

08:53.501 --> 08:55.569
No, we talked about this.

08:55.604 --> 08:57.637
That surgery has an
18-month recovery time

08:57.673 --> 08:59.873
and no guarantee it'll actually work.

08:59.908 --> 09:02.942
My career could be
over, and you know it.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.477
D, you don't get the surgery,

09:04.512 --> 09:06.479
and your career is definitely over.

09:06.514 --> 09:09.682
You can't play like this,
and we can't hide it anymore.

09:11.152 --> 09:12.985
Were you guys hiding this
from me the whole time?

09:13.020 --> 09:13.665
Is that what just...

09:14.369 --> 09:15.747
I mean, you knew about it.
That's why you're here.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.556
It has nothing to do with
"Bitch, please," right?

09:17.592 --> 09:19.625
Look, I could've played
my way out of that nonsense

09:19.660 --> 09:21.093
if I wasn't injured,

09:21.128 --> 09:23.896
but as it is, I still
need to clean up my image

09:23.931 --> 09:26.164
and... and lock down
that sportscasting deal.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.600
That is right, yes.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.334
That is why you need to stay here.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.804
One wrong hit... hell,
one wrong tango step,

09:31.839 --> 09:34.050
and that disc could
fissure and paralyze him.

09:34.050 --> 09:35.240
All right, doc,
that's not gonna happen, okay?

09:35.275 --> 09:37.842
I'm not even playing, so
that's not gonna happen.

09:37.877 --> 09:40.245
- There's no...
- You're not you're not hearing me, D.

09:42.116 --> 09:44.649
Easy, easy, easy.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.951
If it was my call, I'd
duct tape you to a gurney

09:46.987 --> 09:49.354
and haul you out of here
in an ambulance right now.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.024
See?

09:53.059 --> 09:55.927
This show has enough footage
to make you look good.

09:55.962 --> 09:57.629
We spin it so you tweaked your back

09:57.664 --> 09:59.196
saving some girl from drowning,

09:59.232 --> 10:01.633
that you have to leave to
do some physical therapy.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.367
He doesn't know what
he's talking about, okay?

10:03.402 --> 10:05.637
We don't even have
close to enough footage.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.004
You have gone on a couple of dates

10:07.039 --> 10:08.439
and kissed, like, two girls.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.641
Rachel, he's leaving.
This show is not worth...

10:10.676 --> 10:12.478
Do you know that there's
a reporter on set?

10:12.478 --> 10:13.258
Do you?

10:13.457 --> 10:16.113
And if this reporter even
thinks that there is a problem...

10:16.149 --> 10:18.015
- She's got a point.
- Stop.

10:18.050 --> 10:18.856
Fine.

10:20.486 --> 10:23.281
You've got the day, but
we're out of here tonight.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.755
No, that's stupid. I'm not doing it.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.234
I want Darius off the field...

10:32.270 --> 10:33.802
- Mnh-mnh...
- doing a play-by-play with Tiffany.

10:33.837 --> 10:36.058
Why? What is the point of
casting a pro football player

10:36.058 --> 10:38.349
if we're never gonna actually
watch him play football, Rachel?

10:38.349 --> 10:40.365
Tiffany is your wifey.
You should be happy.

10:40.365 --> 10:42.130
This is gonna give her
an opportunity to shine.

10:42.230 --> 10:44.160
- How do you not see that?
- That's so sweet of you.

10:44.460 --> 10:45.599
I'm not an idiot.

10:45.599 --> 10:46.939
What the hell is going on?

10:46.939 --> 10:49.347
- Just do it.
- Fine.

11:10.740 --> 11:12.996
- You're Coleman, right?
- Hmm? Yeah.

11:12.996 --> 11:14.976
So, you're showrunner.

11:14.976 --> 11:15.742
That's right.

11:16.177 --> 11:18.945
Must be a huge job
getting a show like this.

11:18.980 --> 11:20.446
Twinsie.

11:20.481 --> 11:22.048
Oh, hi. You're in my seat.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.382
- Hi. Oh.
- Thanks.

11:23.418 --> 11:25.585
- Talk later.
- Yeah.

11:28.322 --> 11:29.923
Our reporter's here.
He's on his way out.

11:29.958 --> 11:31.057
Mm, cool.

11:31.092 --> 11:32.158
What's the hold up with Darius?

11:32.193 --> 11:34.593
Oh, nothing. It's totally fine.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.716
- Rachel.
- Hmm.

11:37.716 --> 11:38.605
Come on.

11:38.605 --> 11:40.395
I don't play this high school crap.

11:41.035 --> 11:42.435
Here's how this works.

11:42.470 --> 11:43.802
You tell me the truth,

11:43.837 --> 11:45.737
and then we work together as a team.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.239
Or not.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.977
You ready?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.445
For what?

11:54.715 --> 11:56.481
Good.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.237
Oh, this is some bullshit.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.351
Mm-hmm.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.696
- At least they keep giving us drinks.
- Uh-huh.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.323
You guys are really
slugging 'em back, eh?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.872
Yeah, can you bring us another one?

12:04.872 --> 12:06.357
- Number four? Okay.
- Yep.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.019
This is gonna be fun.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.229
- Is it?
- Yeah.

12:08.229 --> 12:10.962
Guys, I was gonna be a doctor.

12:15.475 --> 12:18.669
Hey, so, we really want
to get everyone out there.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.305
You know, having a good time.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.506
So, no one else has a
problem with this? Just me?

12:22.541 --> 12:25.476
Well, I guess the other girls
are just a little more fun.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.612
You need to loosen up a little.

12:31.150 --> 12:34.318
Liquid fun. Palm of your hand.

12:35.208 --> 12:36.687
Come on.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.189
Okay, I mean, you can do what you want,

12:39.225 --> 12:41.391
but Darius says he's gonna cut you

12:41.427 --> 12:42.959
if you don't bring it today.

12:58.343 --> 13:00.476
Romeo wants to get Darius
out of here A.S.A.P.

13:00.512 --> 13:01.511
Wait, okay.

13:01.546 --> 13:03.312
What does Darius want?

13:03.348 --> 13:05.849
Mm.

13:05.884 --> 13:07.651
He's kind of on the fence.

13:09.254 --> 13:11.086
- The doctor's saying that he...
- Well, that's good.

13:11.122 --> 13:12.588
Well, no, the doctor's saying
that he needs to have surgery,

13:12.624 --> 13:13.756
like, yesterday.

13:13.791 --> 13:15.024
Shit.

13:15.059 --> 13:17.226
Do you have anyone that we could call?

13:17.262 --> 13:19.928
Just discretely bring in
here for a second opinion.

13:19.964 --> 13:21.230
I do.

13:21.266 --> 13:22.698
I have a buddy in sports medicine.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.733
He's made a career of
keeping players in the game.

13:24.769 --> 13:27.036
I will call him. I
will call him right now.

13:27.071 --> 13:29.237
- Thank you.
- Yep.

13:31.542 --> 13:32.875
Hey, Quinn.

13:32.910 --> 13:34.409
Leave me alone.

13:36.246 --> 13:37.345
I, uh...

13:37.910 --> 13:39.447
I heard about Randy.

13:41.418 --> 13:42.851
What the hell is that?

13:42.887 --> 13:45.187
Hmm? Oh, that's my progeny.

13:45.222 --> 13:46.454
This is the future of the Wilton line.

13:46.490 --> 13:48.022
Want to hold him?

13:48.058 --> 13:51.893
That caterwauling ball
of flesh is the result

13:51.928 --> 13:53.928
of you cheating on me with your wife.

13:53.963 --> 13:56.864
It came out of her vagina.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.434
So no, I don't want to hold it.

13:59.469 --> 14:00.902
Really puts things in perspective.

14:00.937 --> 14:02.603
You know, the whole
circle of life thing.

14:03.294 --> 14:05.707
Yeah, it's true.

14:05.742 --> 14:07.641
Yeah, you raise kids,

14:07.677 --> 14:09.110
teach them everything you know,

14:09.145 --> 14:11.045
and then they grow up
to stab you in the back.

14:11.081 --> 14:13.447
I'd put a pillow over
its face right now.

14:13.482 --> 14:15.416
Still young enough to claim SIDS.

14:16.852 --> 14:18.586
Quinn?

14:18.621 --> 14:19.720
Quinn, it's Jay.

14:19.755 --> 14:22.323
Go away!

14:22.358 --> 14:24.791
Quinn. Talk to me about Randy.

14:26.795 --> 14:31.131
He was a worthless father,
and now he's dead.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.165
Good talk.

14:32.201 --> 14:34.334
You okay?

14:34.369 --> 14:37.437
I'm developing, Chet, okay?

14:37.472 --> 14:40.907
Can't you tell by all my
colorful Post-it notes?

14:40.943 --> 14:42.442
So, you're giving up.

14:42.477 --> 14:44.244
You know, when I wanted the show back,

14:44.279 --> 14:45.462
you fought me tooth and nail,

14:45.462 --> 14:47.981
but now that it's a little
weirdo and dick for brains,

14:48.016 --> 14:49.815
you're just gonna hand it over to them?

14:49.851 --> 14:51.751
This show is our baby.

14:51.786 --> 14:53.314
We got to fight for it.

14:53.314 --> 14:55.488
Hey, Quinn, did you know that Rachel...

14:55.523 --> 14:57.289
Oh, my God, ew, is that a real baby?

14:57.661 --> 14:59.459
What do you need, Jay?

14:59.494 --> 15:01.827
Rachel and Coleman
are acting real shady.

15:01.863 --> 15:03.929
They've got Darius
standing on the sidelines

15:03.965 --> 15:06.966
wearing a full suit looking
like a black Pee-Wee Herman.

15:07.001 --> 15:08.333
How's he gonna play in a suit?

15:08.369 --> 15:09.468
Oh, that's my point.

15:09.503 --> 15:11.603
Rachel's got him commentating.

15:11.639 --> 15:14.301
How am I supposed to turn that
snore-a-thon into a TV show?

15:14.876 --> 15:17.176
I don't know.

15:17.211 --> 15:18.944
But I will figure it out, all right?

15:18.980 --> 15:20.279
Thank you very much.

15:24.551 --> 15:26.785
What is going on with Darius?

15:28.689 --> 15:31.856
Okay, wait a second.

15:31.892 --> 15:33.057
Who's that guy?

15:33.093 --> 15:34.893
He's a messenger.

15:34.928 --> 15:36.328
Okay, keep going.

15:36.363 --> 15:37.663
Stop, stop.

15:37.698 --> 15:40.031
That's not a messenger.

15:40.066 --> 15:41.866
Darius is hurt.

15:41.902 --> 15:44.635
That's why he's not on the field today.

15:44.671 --> 15:46.537
That's... That's big news.

15:46.572 --> 15:48.406
Could affect his career.

15:49.609 --> 15:53.011
We show that he's hurt,

15:53.046 --> 15:55.579
and that's our story.

15:55.615 --> 15:58.649
We medevac him in a helicopter,

15:58.685 --> 16:00.418
girls crying, sirens blaring,

16:00.453 --> 16:03.053
catfighting over who gets to
ride with him to the hospital.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.922
Just your general ratings-spiking,

16:04.957 --> 16:06.824
promo-making television gold.

16:06.859 --> 16:08.091
And if the show tanks,

16:08.127 --> 16:10.060
it did happen on Coleman's watch.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.595
Exactly. Coleman's out.

16:12.631 --> 16:14.331
They come back to me

16:14.366 --> 16:16.867
as the genius who's made the
show for the last 14 seasons,

16:16.902 --> 16:19.036
and then we just pick a new suitor.

16:19.071 --> 16:21.504
Yeah, square jaw, Midwestern type.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.340
And we're back on the air.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.910
What do we have to do
to make this happen?

16:26.946 --> 16:30.913
We get Darius on the
field, and we take him down.

16:36.969 --> 16:38.668
Change of plans, folks.

16:38.704 --> 16:40.404
A quarterback of Darius' caliber

16:40.439 --> 16:42.006
needs to be able to switch up a play

16:42.041 --> 16:43.673
just like that at the very last second,

16:43.709 --> 16:46.277
and that is exactly what
he has done here today.

16:46.312 --> 16:48.578
See, Darius needs a wider
view of his lineups,

16:48.614 --> 16:50.948
both in the booth
calling today's football game

16:50.983 --> 16:54.785
alongside pro football
princess Tiffany James.

16:54.820 --> 16:56.753
Yeah, she's a pro all right.

16:56.789 --> 17:00.356
Princess my foot.
I actually have tiaras.

17:00.392 --> 17:02.191
The girls are on their own.

17:02.227 --> 17:03.627
First team to score, remember,

17:03.662 --> 17:05.862
gets the coveted dinner
date with our prince.

17:05.897 --> 17:08.964
Go get 'em, ladies. Good luck.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.866
The other girls are gonna hate me.

17:10.902 --> 17:12.701
These other girls? These
other girls already hate you.

17:12.737 --> 17:15.038
You're blonde and rich.
Who cares about them?

17:15.073 --> 17:18.441
This is about you and
Darius sitting side by side.

17:18.476 --> 17:19.909
You know what he's gonna know about you?

17:19.944 --> 17:22.778
He's gonna see that you
are the total package.

17:22.814 --> 17:25.114
He's gonna love you. I see it now.

17:26.800 --> 17:27.616
Right?

17:27.652 --> 17:28.617
You like that.

17:30.455 --> 17:32.421
Hey. Did you hear from your friend?

17:32.457 --> 17:34.490
- Still in surgery.
- Okay.

17:34.525 --> 17:36.325
All right. Let me know
when you hear from him.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.827
- I got to deal with Romeo.
- I got to deal with this guy here.

17:37.862 --> 17:38.961
- Dominick?
- Hey.

17:38.996 --> 17:40.395
- Hey. Coleman Wasserman.
- Pleasure.

17:40.431 --> 17:41.964
Pleasure's mine. I'm the
new showrunner here.

17:41.999 --> 17:43.432
- Thanks for having us.
- Oh, of course.

17:43.467 --> 17:44.899
- Have a good trip?
- Aww, look! It's a...

17:44.935 --> 17:46.634
Fantastic. We had a great drive up.

17:46.670 --> 17:48.170
- Wait, have you been here before?
- This is our first time.

17:48.205 --> 17:50.163
Hey, guys. How are you? It's my kid.

17:50.374 --> 17:52.574
Uh, I'm excited to get you
all that footage you need.

17:52.609 --> 17:54.309
I got to grab this. Hey, buddy.

17:54.345 --> 17:56.311
Thanks for the call back.
It's been a while, huh?

17:56.347 --> 17:57.779
Ladies, hi.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.081
No. Come on.

17:59.116 --> 18:00.247
Move elsewhere. It's, like, dangerous.

18:00.283 --> 18:01.415
Come on. Go feed somewhere else.

18:01.451 --> 18:02.784
All right, ladies, let's go.

18:02.819 --> 18:05.019
- Let's go.
- Everybody, let's say bye, Chet!

18:05.054 --> 18:06.754
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, Chet.

18:06.790 --> 18:08.255
Bye, Chet.

18:08.291 --> 18:09.858
That's the kind of girl
I was telling you about.

18:09.893 --> 18:11.659
That's a lesson for another time.

18:11.695 --> 18:12.927
That's called a lesbian.

18:17.633 --> 18:19.355
Hello, everyone.

18:19.355 --> 18:20.667
It is a beautiful day

18:20.703 --> 18:24.205
for our first "Everlasting"
powder-puff football playoff.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.506
That's right, Tiffany.

18:25.541 --> 18:27.508
The sun is up, the girls are hot,

18:27.543 --> 18:31.479
and we are all ready to
riff... rip... ri... aah!

18:32.287 --> 18:33.981
Cut. Cut!

18:34.016 --> 18:36.950
Don't worry about it, man. Editing.

18:36.986 --> 18:38.952
It's your first time.
You'll figure it out.

18:38.988 --> 18:40.954
Yeah, I haven't done
anything for the first time

18:40.990 --> 18:42.890
in like 16 years.

18:42.925 --> 18:44.324
I'm better at being the best.

18:44.359 --> 18:47.227
Yeah, I get that pressure.

18:47.262 --> 18:49.062
My dad called me the golden child.

18:49.097 --> 18:51.998
For the first two decades of my life,

18:52.034 --> 18:53.533
I tried to be 18 karat.

18:55.504 --> 18:57.703
Me, too.

18:57.739 --> 18:59.872
Still doing it.

18:59.908 --> 19:02.375
Not me.

19:02.411 --> 19:06.646
I've been working really hard
on letting myself off the hook.

19:06.681 --> 19:08.047
You should try it.

19:13.054 --> 19:14.921
Time out! Time out!

19:15.560 --> 19:16.422
Watch my kid.

19:16.457 --> 19:18.090
All right, pink team, blue team,

19:18.125 --> 19:19.692
come on, come on.

19:20.167 --> 19:20.927
Look alive.

19:20.962 --> 19:22.928
Come on. Huddle up, huddle up. Good.

19:22.963 --> 19:24.596
Nice. Grab a piece. There we go.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.998
Listen, uh, slight change of rules.

19:27.034 --> 19:29.034
Uh, we're gonna bring
Darius into this thing,

19:29.070 --> 19:33.872
and, uh, object: Do not win, okay?

19:33.907 --> 19:35.507
I want you to bring him down.

19:35.543 --> 19:37.209
You can kiss him, you can grab him.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.777
I don't care what you do

19:38.812 --> 19:40.663
as long as you bring
Darius down into the dirt.

19:40.663 --> 19:41.680
Why?

19:42.916 --> 19:44.950
Because that's the show.
That's the show.

19:44.985 --> 19:46.751
You know, it's the football player

19:46.787 --> 19:48.286
with the sexy, beautiful girls

19:48.321 --> 19:50.789
bringing him down into the dirt, okay?

19:50.824 --> 19:54.593
And plus, plus, whoever
brings him down first

19:54.628 --> 19:55.926
gets a one-on-one date.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.861
Sound good? Hands in, ladies.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.931
Go!

20:00.967 --> 20:02.900
- All right!
- Let's play some ball!

20:02.935 --> 20:04.868
Uh, London, can I have a word?

20:04.904 --> 20:07.572
Um... I understand

20:07.607 --> 20:10.475
Darius, uh, isn't paying
much attention to you.

20:10.510 --> 20:14.244
Yeah, apparently, I need to "bring it."

20:14.279 --> 20:18.782
Uh-huh. Um... come with me.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.784
Right.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.086
Okay, yep.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.821
Yep, thank you.

20:23.856 --> 20:24.922
Thank you.

20:26.358 --> 20:27.825
What's the deal, Rach?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.226
I asked for two tickets to LAX tonight.

20:29.261 --> 20:30.893
They told me that you said no.

20:30.929 --> 20:32.969
Yeah, I just need a little
bit more time with Darius.

20:32.969 --> 20:34.663
No, we're out of here tonight.

20:34.663 --> 20:35.886
It's a wrap, Goldberg.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.567
No, come on. No, no.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.569
I just need six episodes total.

20:39.605 --> 20:42.071
Okay? That's only
three more after today.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.674
I mean, I'll just quickly
get it down to the final two.

20:44.709 --> 20:47.310
I can do everything I would've
done in a full season.

20:47.310 --> 20:48.077
Rachel...

20:48.113 --> 20:49.978
I will make his exit ratings gold

20:50.014 --> 20:51.680
with a pot full of contracts

20:51.715 --> 20:53.149
at the end of the rainbow,

20:53.184 --> 20:54.617
which you know makes him happy,

20:54.652 --> 20:57.286
and it's gonna make you look so good.

20:57.321 --> 20:58.820
Come on.

20:58.856 --> 21:01.757
I mean, we made all of this happen.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.559
We can fix it.

21:06.964 --> 21:09.798
I'm just saying, besides...

21:10.868 --> 21:12.167
I missed you.

21:12.202 --> 21:13.635
What are you doing, Rachel?

21:13.671 --> 21:15.336
My God.

21:19.910 --> 21:21.176
- Okay.
- Okay?

21:21.211 --> 21:22.810
- Okay, got one.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

21:22.845 --> 21:24.779
Okay, okay. So, how do you
give a lemon an orgasm?

21:24.814 --> 21:26.214
How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

21:26.249 --> 21:27.482
- Oh.
- Oh.

21:27.517 --> 21:28.883
Uh, we are back, Darius.

21:28.918 --> 21:30.052
No, no. Wait.

21:30.076 --> 21:30.319
We're back.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.452
No, stop, stop. You got to tell me.

21:31.488 --> 21:32.134
How? How?

21:32.134 --> 21:33.355
No.

21:33.356 --> 21:34.689
- No, you give me the punch line.
- I'll give it to you later.

21:34.724 --> 21:36.324
I'll give it to you
later after the game.

21:36.359 --> 21:39.193
Why the hell are you in here
when we're all out there?

21:39.228 --> 21:42.629
I was promised a game
with you, Darius Beck,

21:42.665 --> 21:44.732
and I intend to collect.

21:45.296 --> 21:46.466
You're not scared of playing

21:46.502 --> 21:48.035
with a few girls, are you?

21:50.364 --> 21:52.153
Of course not.

21:52.153 --> 21:54.408
Ah. Then let's play.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.553
Okay, let's play then.

21:56.553 --> 21:57.578
Okay.

21:59.047 --> 22:02.616
Ladies, ladies, okay. I'm up now.

22:02.651 --> 22:04.584
- Hey, Darius.
- Talk to me.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.185
- I'm good.
- You girls look good out there.

22:06.221 --> 22:07.754
- That's a nice suit.
- Thank you.

22:07.790 --> 22:10.023
Whoa, whoa!

22:10.058 --> 22:12.691
I think I should not
play football in a suit.

22:12.727 --> 22:15.094
We should probably take it off.

22:22.437 --> 22:24.437
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell?

22:29.811 --> 22:32.545
I won! I won!

22:37.184 --> 22:39.418
Are you okay, Darius?

22:39.454 --> 22:43.255
- Are you okay?
- Darius, are you all right?

22:45.525 --> 22:46.219
Help.

22:46.243 --> 22:47.994
We'll get you some help right now, okay?

22:47.995 --> 22:49.127
Guys! Somebody...

22:51.212 --> 22:52.978
- Rachel.
- Oh. This is unbelievable.

22:53.013 --> 22:54.512
Oy vey. I talked to my friend.

22:54.548 --> 22:56.614
We do have an option.
It's incredibly risky.

22:59.052 --> 23:00.819
Where the hell is my ambulance?

23:00.854 --> 23:03.562
I mean, Quinn, they said
they were on the way,

23:03.562 --> 23:04.907
but we've cried wolf so many times,

23:04.907 --> 23:05.837
you know they never believe us.

23:06.060 --> 23:07.998
Well, call them again.

23:08.362 --> 23:09.627
Okay.

23:11.130 --> 23:14.265
Huh? This is fantastic, right?

23:14.300 --> 23:16.500
I mean, he gets taken
away to the hospital,

23:16.535 --> 23:18.936
girls weeping, bedside vigils.

23:18.972 --> 23:20.504
We throw in some sexy nurses.

23:20.539 --> 23:22.874
It's like "Everlasting M.D."

23:22.909 --> 23:25.709
Quinn, this is, like,
a serious situation.

23:25.745 --> 23:27.778
You can't... you can't
do that to his whole life.

23:27.813 --> 23:29.213
He's hurt. You're
gonna wreck his career.

23:29.249 --> 23:31.648
Aww. That's so sad.

23:31.684 --> 23:33.283
This is gonna blow back on you.

23:33.318 --> 23:35.051
Clearly you didn't vet him properly.

23:35.087 --> 23:36.720
He's a professional football player.

23:36.756 --> 23:38.789
Do you think that if his
team couldn't catch it

23:38.824 --> 23:40.156
that we could've?

23:40.192 --> 23:42.693
But legally, you're culpable.

23:42.728 --> 23:44.828
Oh. Oh, let me guess.

23:44.864 --> 23:46.662
Uh, the network promised

23:46.698 --> 23:49.065
that they would support your vision

23:49.101 --> 23:50.466
and put you on a deal,

23:50.502 --> 23:52.402
and said you could develop
whatever you wanted,

23:52.437 --> 23:55.038
and you jumped on it like
the rodent that you are,

23:55.073 --> 23:58.408
and they asked for one
teeny, tinesy little favor.

23:58.443 --> 24:00.810
"'Everlasting" is a cash cow,

24:00.845 --> 24:02.578
but right now, it's a
bit of a train wreck,

24:02.614 --> 24:04.079
so we were just wondering

24:04.115 --> 24:06.315
if you could go in and
maybe fix it up a little"?

24:06.350 --> 24:10.686
Hmm. Well, here's the dealio, boy-chick.

24:10.722 --> 24:13.055
Uh, in a few minutes,

24:13.090 --> 24:17.393
your star is going to be
jumping in an ambulance,

24:17.429 --> 24:19.261
and he's going to get taken away,

24:19.297 --> 24:20.896
and your season is screwed.

24:20.932 --> 24:24.266
So, you can blame me,
you can blame Chet.

24:24.302 --> 24:25.901
I mean, you can even blame Santa Claus.

24:25.937 --> 24:29.504
But the network doesn't care
because all the network knows

24:29.540 --> 24:31.873
is that they put you in charge,

24:31.909 --> 24:34.876
and all of this happened on your watch

24:34.912 --> 24:39.681
because, uh, you're the
showrunner, remember?

24:41.151 --> 24:43.192
Good luck digging
yourself out of this one.

24:44.621 --> 24:46.187
He's here.

24:46.222 --> 24:47.456
Let's go.

24:47.491 --> 24:49.057
I'll distract Romeo.

24:52.395 --> 24:53.727
D, you good?

24:55.098 --> 24:56.697
I've been better. That's for damn sure.

24:56.732 --> 24:58.532
Okay, well, it's about
to get a little bit worse.

24:58.568 --> 25:00.534
Um...

25:00.570 --> 25:02.937
Quinn wants to use the
footage of you getting hurt.

25:02.973 --> 25:04.493
- What?! No.
- Yeah, she's got an

25:04.493 --> 25:06.456
ambulance on its way right now.

25:07.177 --> 25:08.476
She's gonna out you.

25:08.511 --> 25:10.544
She's basically gonna say that, um,

25:10.580 --> 25:12.312
you've been lying to
your team this whole time.

25:12.348 --> 25:14.815
That'll kill my career, my
sportscasting gig, all of it.

25:14.851 --> 25:16.650
I know. The media is
gonna be all over this.

25:16.686 --> 25:18.452
You're gonna be a guy that hates women

25:18.488 --> 25:19.887
and lies about his injuries.

25:19.922 --> 25:21.421
Rachel, you got to make this go away.

25:21.457 --> 25:22.192
Look, I'm trying to,

25:22.192 --> 25:24.592
but I'm gonna need you
on board, like, 100%.

25:26.928 --> 25:30.597
I have a doctor that will give you...

25:30.632 --> 25:31.965
He'll give you an epidural.

25:32.001 --> 25:33.433
An epidural?

25:33.469 --> 25:34.667
Yeah, it just... it'll
just block the pain.

25:34.703 --> 25:35.935
I know what an epidural is.

25:35.971 --> 25:38.238
But my doc says I need the pain.

25:38.273 --> 25:40.007
Otherwise, I could
end up in a wheelchair.

25:40.042 --> 25:41.908
Dude, I'm not gonna put
you in any kind of situation

25:41.943 --> 25:42.942
where you can get hurt.

25:42.978 --> 25:44.076
I promise.

25:44.112 --> 25:45.645
I don't know, Rachel.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.346
I don't know. I'm...

25:47.382 --> 25:48.615
Romeo, we talked about it,

25:48.650 --> 25:50.149
and he says it's not worth the risk.

25:50.184 --> 25:51.584
- He says what?
- He says it's not worth the risk.

25:51.620 --> 25:53.520
Is he the one that's
risking his life every week?

25:53.555 --> 25:55.588
But he's always had my back. Always has.

25:55.624 --> 25:57.490
I'm just saying that if
you finish the season,

25:57.526 --> 25:59.158
you're a bona fide star.

25:59.193 --> 26:01.660
You just have to ask yourself
at the end of the day,

26:01.695 --> 26:02.361
what do you want?

26:02.397 --> 26:04.596
What do you want, D?

26:05.833 --> 26:07.033
I support a lot of people, Rachel.

26:07.068 --> 26:08.467
A lot of people.

26:08.907 --> 26:12.438
And Romeo says not to
worry about it, and...

26:12.473 --> 26:13.772
not even worry about him,

26:13.807 --> 26:16.274
not to worry about my mom, my niece.

26:16.309 --> 26:18.810
Just to focus on me.

26:18.846 --> 26:19.945
But...

26:19.980 --> 26:21.880
You feel responsible for them.

26:21.916 --> 26:24.115
Yeah.

26:27.154 --> 26:29.621
Okay, just get the epidural,

26:29.657 --> 26:32.290
you walk out that door,
you put on a smile.

26:32.325 --> 26:34.159
The ambulance is gone, you're not in it.

26:34.194 --> 26:37.562
Your mom's safe, your niece is safe.

26:39.399 --> 26:42.233
The doctor's right outside.

26:42.269 --> 26:44.936
We can fix this right now.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.012
Let's do it.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.587
All right, ladies, come on.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.154
I need my girls with me.
You girls with Madison.

27:04.190 --> 27:05.255
Quickly! Let's go!

27:05.291 --> 27:06.823
You can maybe go through here.

27:06.858 --> 27:08.225
- Ladies!
- Hurry it up. Get over here.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.659
Ladies, come on, come on, come on!

27:09.695 --> 27:10.694
Listen to me!

27:10.729 --> 27:12.396
Hello. Hi. Guess what.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.098
In a short while, Darius
is gonna be leaving

27:14.133 --> 27:15.566
on a stretcher for the hospital.

27:15.601 --> 27:18.001
Okay, it is a very grave situation.

27:18.036 --> 27:19.336
Very grave.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.170
Rachel said he was okay.

27:21.206 --> 27:23.239
Well, Rachel doesn't know
what she's talking about, okay?

27:23.274 --> 27:25.041
- I do.
- Wait, he walks to the..

27:25.077 --> 27:26.409
Hi, hello?

27:26.444 --> 27:28.344
I'm still standing here, okay?

27:28.379 --> 27:30.179
Here's what I need you to understand.

27:30.215 --> 27:32.181
This is a stretcher.

27:32.217 --> 27:34.517
Darius will be on it
going to the hospital,

27:34.552 --> 27:35.919
and it is your fault.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.886
- Wait. What?
- All of you did this to him.

27:37.922 --> 27:39.589
He is in pain.

27:39.624 --> 27:42.191
I need tears, I need weeping,

27:42.227 --> 27:46.528
I need snot running down
your beautiful faces, okay?

27:46.563 --> 27:48.930
You'll glow like cherubs.

27:48.965 --> 27:50.965
Anything?

27:51.001 --> 27:52.867
I mean, it's as if Taylor
Swift, you know, asked you

27:52.902 --> 27:56.671
to be a part of her girl squad
and then changed her mind.

27:58.915 --> 28:01.042
Oh, my God.

28:01.748 --> 28:02.777
There we go.

28:02.812 --> 28:03.711
All right.

28:19.314 --> 28:21.314
Okay, he's coming out.
Keep up the tears.

28:21.578 --> 28:23.211
Now listen, whoever cries the hardest

28:23.246 --> 28:26.780
gets to ride to the ER with Darius.

28:26.916 --> 28:28.082
Okay? Got it?

28:28.118 --> 28:29.584
All right, let's go, Dan. Come on.

28:29.619 --> 28:31.552
- Okay, all right, ladies.
- Brilliant.

28:31.588 --> 28:32.987
You are still the master.

28:34.090 --> 28:36.557
Okay. Three, two, one.

28:36.593 --> 28:40.461
Why is he not on the gur...

28:40.497 --> 28:42.329
What the hell?

28:42.364 --> 28:44.999
- What?
- He's walking?

28:47.102 --> 28:48.602
Ladies.

28:48.637 --> 28:50.903
What's up? Why so sad?

28:50.939 --> 28:53.673
- What?
- Okay, I'm confused.

28:53.708 --> 28:55.175
Quinn said you were really hurt.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.347
Look, it was just another
day at the office, okay?

29:01.382 --> 29:03.983
If I was hurt, could I do this?

29:07.055 --> 29:09.122
All right, so what's next?

29:09.157 --> 29:12.091
Um, I think I was supposed to be going

29:12.127 --> 29:15.094
on a one-on-one with some lucky lady.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.828
That's... that's me. That's me.

29:16.864 --> 29:18.597
Hey. Ooh.

29:18.633 --> 29:19.931
- Hey.
- Mm.

29:19.967 --> 29:22.334
You're just gorgeous.

29:22.370 --> 29:23.769
Thank you.

29:24.213 --> 29:24.870
Oh, my gosh!

29:26.974 --> 29:28.674
Well, that's something.

29:28.709 --> 29:29.975
How'd you get it that pink?

29:30.010 --> 29:31.143
It's just Pepto-Bismol.

29:31.179 --> 29:32.477
I gave her enough to drown a horse.

29:32.512 --> 29:34.179
- Oh.
- It's fantastic,

29:34.214 --> 29:36.181
and now we're gonna
use the ambulance, okay?

29:36.216 --> 29:38.316
Let's up her sickness,
take her to the hospital.

29:38.351 --> 29:40.285
So tell them to turn the sirens on now.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.519
Excuse me, ladies. Excuse me.

29:41.555 --> 29:42.487
Let's just keep walking.

29:42.522 --> 29:44.289
She threw up on my shoes.

29:44.324 --> 29:48.026
She threw up on my shoes.

29:48.062 --> 29:49.561
But you know what?

29:49.596 --> 29:51.128
What?

29:51.164 --> 29:53.531
What the hell are you actually doing?

29:55.835 --> 29:57.835
- Bro, calm down, okay?
- Calm down?

29:57.870 --> 30:01.105
I saw you throw that ball.
You didn't even wince.

30:02.942 --> 30:04.342
Rachel gave me a shot, okay?

30:04.377 --> 30:07.011
Look, she gave me a shot.
I can finish the show.

30:07.046 --> 30:08.813
I'll be fine. You don't know that.

30:08.848 --> 30:11.248
You think she's gonna wipe
your ass when you're paralyzed?

30:11.283 --> 30:14.351
Drooling away the next 40 years
of your life in some rehab joint.

30:14.386 --> 30:16.587
- Hey, D. Hi.
- We're actually ready for you.

30:16.622 --> 30:17.688
We're moving a little slow, so...

30:17.724 --> 30:19.924
Get out of here, Rachel!

30:19.959 --> 30:22.859
- Ease up, ease up, okay? Ease up.
- It's totally fine. It's totally fine.

30:22.894 --> 30:24.595
You stay on this show,
you're killing yourself,

30:24.630 --> 30:26.062
and I'm not gonna be a part of it.

30:26.098 --> 30:27.497
I mean it, D.

30:27.533 --> 30:28.465
Okay.

30:29.735 --> 30:31.167
Then you can go.

30:31.203 --> 30:32.836
- What?
- You heard me.

30:32.871 --> 30:34.571
I made my decision.

30:34.607 --> 30:39.008
If you can't support it, then...

30:39.044 --> 30:40.610
Then you're fired.

30:40.645 --> 30:43.546
You can't be serious right now.

30:50.956 --> 30:52.555
I'll talk to him.

30:52.590 --> 30:54.690
I gave my life for Darius.

30:54.726 --> 30:56.392
That's my blood.

30:56.427 --> 30:58.261
You have any idea what that's like?

30:58.296 --> 31:00.396
Of course not.

31:00.431 --> 31:02.632
You just poisoned the best thing

31:02.667 --> 31:04.600
that either one of us ever had.

31:04.636 --> 31:07.703
And for a television show.

31:07.739 --> 31:09.872
Now you have to live with that.

31:09.907 --> 31:12.241
You talk to God about that, Rachel.

31:22.787 --> 31:24.753
Watch your backs.

31:24.789 --> 31:27.089
All right. Here we go. Raising up.

31:30.827 --> 31:31.806
All right, great, here you go.

31:31.806 --> 31:32.604
Take her around the block

31:32.604 --> 31:35.664
because we need her back here
for the elimination ceremony.

31:35.699 --> 31:37.064
Thank you very much.

31:37.100 --> 31:39.567
All right, girls, back in your gowns.

31:39.603 --> 31:41.303
Let's go. Come on.

31:41.338 --> 31:42.671
Okay, ladies, let's head inside
to the green room for touch ups.

31:42.706 --> 31:44.405
- Pick it up.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

31:45.441 --> 31:46.908
Thank you.

31:46.943 --> 31:48.509
Chin up. It's not that big of a deal.

31:48.544 --> 31:50.945
Jameson, pick it up. Let's go.

31:50.980 --> 31:51.946
Look at you.

31:51.981 --> 31:53.247
Hit it out for the win,

31:53.283 --> 31:54.982
like there's nothing you can't do.

31:55.018 --> 31:57.584
Okay, Chet. Nothing we can't do.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.620
We're good together.

31:59.655 --> 32:02.623
Working together... side by side,

32:02.658 --> 32:04.758
it reminded me of the
way things used to be.

32:04.794 --> 32:06.259
You know?

32:06.295 --> 32:08.529
I-I should've left
Cynthia the day I met you.

32:10.032 --> 32:11.765
I would've saved
everybody a lot of grief.

32:11.801 --> 32:14.301
You're the love of my life.

32:14.337 --> 32:15.969
Look.

32:16.004 --> 32:17.670
I-I want you to trust me, okay?

32:17.706 --> 32:19.940
'Cause I-I have a baby now,
and I've... I've changed.

32:19.975 --> 32:21.474
I'm responsible now.

32:21.509 --> 32:24.110
If we tried this again,
if we tried it again,

32:24.146 --> 32:25.979
it would be a whole new universe.

32:26.014 --> 32:28.114
It would be... it'd
be the one you deserve.

32:30.085 --> 32:32.185
If we're gonna do this, it would be...

32:32.221 --> 32:34.887
Oh, I told them to go around
the corner, not down the drive...

32:34.922 --> 32:36.689
a whole new universe.

32:36.725 --> 32:38.825
Well, who called the cops?

32:38.860 --> 32:40.660
Uh...

32:40.695 --> 32:42.061
Chet Wilton?

32:42.096 --> 32:44.196
Oh, no. Uh, you know what?

32:44.232 --> 32:45.498
This isn't what it looks
like. I assure you...

32:45.533 --> 32:47.032
You're under arrest for kidnapping

32:47.068 --> 32:48.300
- and child endangerment.
- She's gonna keep... okay.

32:48.336 --> 32:49.469
- Seriously?
- This is ridiculous.

32:49.504 --> 32:52.037
- You stole your kid?
- No. No.

32:52.073 --> 32:53.672
Uh, that's my son, okay?

32:53.707 --> 32:55.207
- Get your hands behind your back.
- That's my son.

32:55.243 --> 32:56.909
- Hey!
- Hands behind your back.

32:56.944 --> 32:58.477
- What is she doing?
- Stand down, stand down.

32:58.512 --> 33:00.179
All right, I'm not... I'm fine.

33:00.214 --> 33:01.313
I meant every word I said.

33:01.349 --> 33:02.348
- Come on.
- Okay?

33:02.383 --> 33:03.548
Every word, Quinn.

33:04.622 --> 33:07.519
What are you doing with my son?

33:16.990 --> 33:19.758
"Everlasting" is about love.

33:19.793 --> 33:23.261
But sometimes, love is about loss.

33:23.296 --> 33:25.263
Letting five of you go feels big.

33:25.298 --> 33:27.265
Like it's the end of one thing

33:27.300 --> 33:29.633
and the beginning of something else.

33:29.969 --> 33:32.336
If I call your name,
come stand beside me.

33:32.372 --> 33:34.739
We'll continue this journey together.

33:34.774 --> 33:38.376
If I don't... well, I
wish you all the best.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.812
Ruby.

33:46.385 --> 33:47.784
Chantal.

33:54.359 --> 33:55.392
Tiffany.

33:57.396 --> 33:58.828
Jameson.

34:03.969 --> 34:05.367
Beth Ann.

34:12.043 --> 34:13.509
It's the last one.

34:13.543 --> 34:16.178
Thank you.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.581
Yael.

34:24.989 --> 34:27.188
So, I'm just a joke?

34:27.225 --> 34:28.956
Drunk Muslim, huh?

34:28.993 --> 34:30.840
You can shove this up your

34:35.465 --> 34:37.264
Come on! Go, go, go!

34:37.300 --> 34:40.168
Follow the drama! Go!

34:44.742 --> 34:45.974
Phew!

34:46.010 --> 34:47.708
So, this is the party truck, huh?

34:47.745 --> 34:49.777
You found it.

34:49.813 --> 34:51.612
You gonna give me some?

35:01.625 --> 35:03.591
So, I think Rachel hates me.

35:05.928 --> 35:08.228
Join the club.

35:08.264 --> 35:10.197
Why does she hate you?

35:13.770 --> 35:16.503
Oh, you two had a thing, huh?

35:16.539 --> 35:18.839
Yeah, we're, uh...

35:18.875 --> 35:20.708
we're not gonna talk about that.

35:23.012 --> 35:24.744
It's pretty amazing
how she gets everybody

35:24.780 --> 35:25.945
to do the things they do.

35:25.981 --> 35:29.049
You don't know the half of it.

35:30.719 --> 35:33.520
I'd like to know.

35:33.556 --> 35:35.222
All of it.

35:39.562 --> 35:45.298
That would require me getting
to know you a lot better.

35:45.333 --> 35:49.368
Well, in that case, why
don't you give me a tour?

35:52.373 --> 35:54.273
It's a pretty small truck.

35:54.309 --> 35:55.842
Not much to see.

35:58.145 --> 36:01.280
I, um...

36:01.316 --> 36:03.015
I wasn't talking about the truck.

36:20.434 --> 36:23.035
"Everlasting" is about love.

36:27.708 --> 36:29.608
You want a beer?

36:30.844 --> 36:31.976
I'm not your friend.

36:32.011 --> 36:34.078
Congratulations.

36:34.114 --> 36:36.080
You showed me, huh?

36:36.116 --> 36:38.383
I guess you can make
this show without me.

36:38.418 --> 36:40.084
Look, Quinn,

36:40.120 --> 36:42.420
I know we're fighting
about work stuff, but...

36:42.456 --> 36:45.823
Work stuff?

36:45.859 --> 36:48.592
What other stuff is there?

36:48.628 --> 36:50.494
That's us.

36:50.529 --> 36:52.263
We work.

36:52.298 --> 36:53.597
And not well.

36:53.633 --> 36:56.400
I'm done.

36:56.435 --> 36:59.336
I'm done with all the
garbage people in my life.

36:59.372 --> 37:03.774
Randy, Chet, and now you.

37:05.878 --> 37:08.879
Um, I'm sorry.

37:08.914 --> 37:10.347
They keep calling the production office.

37:10.383 --> 37:11.682
They want to know what to do

37:11.717 --> 37:12.849
with your father's personal effects.

37:16.155 --> 37:18.289
Just put everything in the
house, throw in a match,

37:18.324 --> 37:20.090
and burn it to the ground.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.801
You're a hard man to find.

37:30.836 --> 37:32.769
You alone?

37:34.006 --> 37:35.906
You mean are there cameras on my ass?

37:35.941 --> 37:37.540
No, they don't follow me.

37:37.575 --> 37:38.874
I'm not a wifey.

37:41.646 --> 37:43.245
Can I sit down?

37:51.923 --> 37:53.823
So, Romeo left, huh?

37:53.858 --> 37:55.624
What happened?

37:55.659 --> 37:59.261
I'm tired of people telling
me what to do, so I let him go.

37:59.297 --> 38:02.064
He's family, Darius.

38:02.099 --> 38:03.799
You can't just let him go.

38:05.669 --> 38:07.569
Hey, what's going on with you?

38:07.604 --> 38:09.604
Seriously, this is just me, okay?

38:09.640 --> 38:13.241
This is not about some game.

38:13.276 --> 38:14.443
Are you okay?

38:20.217 --> 38:21.583
Man, I don't like

38:21.618 --> 38:24.486
what this place is doing to everybody.

38:24.521 --> 38:26.287
Hell, I don't like
what it's doing to me.

38:26.323 --> 38:28.022
What's it doing to you?

38:28.058 --> 38:31.125
Making me care too much
about what other people think.

38:31.161 --> 38:32.793
Like who?

38:32.829 --> 38:35.696
Like you.

38:38.301 --> 38:41.236
Well, that's okay, then.

38:43.373 --> 38:46.707
You're so strong.

38:46.743 --> 38:48.008
I mean, don't get me wrong,

38:48.043 --> 38:49.477
you got a mouth on you and all, but...

38:49.512 --> 38:51.879
A mouth. Okay, grandma.

38:54.316 --> 38:56.950
I spent my entire life

38:56.986 --> 39:00.720
letting other people
make decisions for me.

39:00.756 --> 39:02.655
Not anymore.

39:02.691 --> 39:04.524
It's time I be my own man.

39:04.559 --> 39:06.360
I get that.

39:06.395 --> 39:08.695
It just...

39:08.730 --> 39:12.199
It just feels good to do
something I want to do.

39:12.234 --> 39:14.734
Not to worry for once, to take a chance.

39:14.770 --> 39:18.505
See, that's the guy I want to be.

39:18.540 --> 39:22.509
So do it.

39:22.544 --> 39:23.676
Be that guy.

39:43.131 --> 39:45.998
Are you sure this is
what that guy wants?

39:46.034 --> 39:48.834
Yeah.

39:48.869 --> 39:52.638
This is exactly what that guy wants.

40:16.563 --> 40:18.129
Wasserman, where are you going?

40:18.165 --> 40:19.397
Hey, you.

40:21.268 --> 40:22.733
Want a beer?

40:23.803 --> 40:25.202
Yes, I'd love this.

40:25.237 --> 40:26.537
Good.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.373
Please.

40:29.408 --> 40:30.875
Thank you.

40:37.984 --> 40:41.251
Are we doing this, Wasserman?
