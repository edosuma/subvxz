(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.736 --> 00:05.739
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.476
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.509 --> 00:10.344
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.378 --> 00:11.712
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.745 --> 00:13.747
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.184
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.419
NEXT.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.190
MORNING-AFTER PILL.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.592
I'M SORRY.
COULD YOU SPEAK UP, PLEASE?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.360
I NEED
THE MORNING-AFTER PILL.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.296
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO YOUR DOCTOR

00:28.329 --> 00:30.064
ABOUT EMERGENCY
CONTRACEPTION?

00:30.098 --> 00:32.166
I THOUGHT I DIDN'T NEED
A PRESCRIPTION.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.834
YOU DON'T, BUT IT'S BEST
IF YOU SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN--

00:33.867 --> 00:35.303
JUST GIVE ME THE PILL.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.370
HAVE YOU
CONSIDERED ADOPTION?

00:36.404 --> 00:37.771
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.473
PLEASE, I NEED IT!
LET GO OF ME.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.475
SECURITY!
I CAN'T HAVE HIS BABY.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.476
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE LET HIM GET

00:42.510 --> 00:43.577
INTO YOUR PANTS.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.812
PLEASE, NO.
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS!

00:44.845 --> 00:48.116
DON'T DO THIS!
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!

00:48.149 --> 00:50.050
[crying]
I WAS RAPED.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.821
MIA, I'M DETECTIVE BENSON.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.623
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
DETECTIVE STABLER.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.091
ARE YOU TAKING ME
TO JAIL?

00:57.125 --> 00:58.659
YOU CUFFED
A RAPE VICTIM?

00:58.692 --> 01:00.728
SHE CREATED A DISTURBANCE.
IT'S STORE POLICY.

01:00.761 --> 01:01.729
UNHOOK HER.

01:01.762 --> 01:02.796
SHE ASSAULTED ME.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.232
UNHOOK HER NOW.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.799
FINE.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.568
QUICKLY.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.540
MIA, WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:12.573 --> 01:16.144
[scoffs]
I'M PRESSING CHARGES.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.146
DON'T PRESS YOUR LUCK.

01:19.480 --> 01:29.523
*

01:29.523 --> 01:39.533
*

02:08.396 --> 02:09.363
IS MIA DOING OKAY?

02:09.397 --> 02:10.831
YEAH, SHE'S RESTING,

02:10.864 --> 02:12.700
BUT SHE'S PRETTY
SHAKEN UP.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.768
(Benson)
THE RAPIST REALLY
WORKED HER OVER.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.304
AND SO DID
THAT PHARMACIST.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.938
TOO MANY OF THEM THINK
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

02:17.971 --> 02:19.940
TO PUSH THEIR BELIEFS
ON THEIR PATIENTS.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.809
MAYBE IF THEY'D BEEN RAPED
THEY'D BE MORE COMPASSIONATE.

02:21.842 --> 02:22.910
MIA UP TO TALKING?

02:22.943 --> 02:24.378
YEAH.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.514
FIND HIM FAST,
WILL YOU, DETECTIVE?

02:26.547 --> 02:28.616
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
ANY MORE OF HIS HANDIWORK.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.420
IT WAS GETTING LIGHT.

02:32.453 --> 02:36.557
I WENT OUT FOR BAGELS,
AND I WAS ON 97th STREET

02:36.590 --> 02:40.861
WHEN HE GRABBED ME
FROM BEHIND.

02:40.894 --> 02:42.530
IT'S OKAY, MIA.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.832
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
JUST TAKE A BREATH.

02:46.934 --> 02:51.639
HE, UM--
HE HAD A KNIFE,

02:51.672 --> 02:55.643
AND HE SAID THAT
IF I SCREAMED

02:55.676 --> 02:56.677
HE'D SLIT MY THROAT.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.913
THEN HE DRAGGED ME
INTO THE ALLEY,

02:59.947 --> 03:01.982
AND I TRIED TO RUN,
BUT THEN HE KNOCKED ME DOWN

03:02.015 --> 03:05.919
AND HE STARTED PUNCHING ME

03:05.953 --> 03:08.989
AND KICKING ME
IN THE STOMACH.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.358
AND I MUST HAVE PASSED OUT,

03:10.391 --> 03:11.725
BECAUSE THE NEXT
THING I REMEMBER,

03:11.759 --> 03:14.728
HE WAS ON TOP OF ME.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.264
INSIDE ME.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.398
CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.433
HE WAS TALL,

03:19.467 --> 03:21.869
WHITE, AND BIG.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.272
BUT HE TOLD ME

03:24.305 --> 03:25.306
NOT TO LOOK AT HIM.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.008
ALL I COULD THINK IS
THAT MY HUSBAND AND I

03:28.041 --> 03:29.843
ARE TRYING
TO GET PREGNANT

03:29.877 --> 03:33.481
AND I'M OVULATING.

03:33.514 --> 03:37.518
I SAW THE PHARMACY
AND I RAN IN.

03:37.551 --> 03:41.989
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE HIS BABY.

03:42.022 --> 03:42.990
ABOUT TIME
YOU SHOWED UP.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.925
YOU'RE BUSTING OUR BALLS?
WHERE'S YOUR TEAM?

03:44.958 --> 03:45.793
COME AND GONE.

03:45.826 --> 03:46.660
YOU ALREADY PROCESSED
THE CRIME SCENE?

03:46.694 --> 03:48.529
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.
I JUST SET UP THE TAPE

03:48.562 --> 03:50.030
AND SENT EVERYBODY HOME.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.765
SOMEONE DUMPED MOTOR OIL
IN THAT DUMPSTER.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.702
IT LEAKED OUT,
GAVE THE PAVEMENT A LUBE JOB.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.636
NOTHING'S BETTER
FOR TRAPPING

03:55.669 --> 03:57.371
PRINTS AND FIBERS
THAN A LITTLE GREASE,

03:57.405 --> 03:59.573
BUT THERE'S NOT
EVEN A SHOE PRINT.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.441
SO, IF MIA WAS ON HER BACK,

04:00.474 --> 04:02.610
THERE'D BE SMUDGES,
SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.779
YEAH, AND THERE'D BE OIL
ALL OVER HER CLOTHES.

04:05.813 --> 04:08.416
YOUR VICTIM LIED TO YOU.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.417
WELL, NOT ABOUT BEING RAPED.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.418
SOMEONE BEAT THE CRAP
OUT OF HER.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.552
WE SAW PHOTOS
OF HER INJURIES.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.322
WHICH ALL HAPPENED TO BE
IN PLACES COVERED BY CLOTHES,

04:14.355 --> 04:15.623
SO THE BRUISES
WOULDN'T SHOW.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.958
CLASSIC DV.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.593
OUR PERP'S HER HUSBAND.

04:21.695 --> 04:22.896
[door bell buzzes]

04:22.930 --> 04:23.897
MIA!

04:23.931 --> 04:26.300
IT'S DETECTIVE BENSON
CALLING.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.304
UM, NOW'S NOT REALLY
A GOOD TIME.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.772
IS YOUR HUSBAND HOME?

04:31.805 --> 04:34.308
NO, BRENT'S STILL AT WORK.
WHY?

04:34.342 --> 04:35.576
YOU KNOW WHY.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.777
MIA, YOU WERE ASSAULTED,

04:36.810 --> 04:38.011
BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
THE WAY YOU SAID IT DID.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.780
ARE YOU SAYING
I'M A LIAR?

04:39.813 --> 04:41.349
I'M SAYING THAT
YOU'RE A VICTIM,

04:41.382 --> 04:43.417
AND I CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS
YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

04:43.451 --> 04:45.886
HI, HONEY!

04:45.919 --> 04:47.621
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

04:47.655 --> 04:48.622
WELL, I COULDN'T
WAIT TO SEE

04:48.656 --> 04:50.424
MY BEST GIRL.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.892
YOU GONNA INTRODUCE ME
TO YOUR FRIENDS?

04:51.925 --> 04:53.594
I'M DETECTIVE STABLER.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.028
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
DETECTIVE BENSON.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.598
WE'RE INVESTIGATING A STRING
OF RESIDENTIAL BURGLARIES

04:57.631 --> 04:58.532
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.501
WELL, WE HAVE A GREAT
SECURITY SYSTEM HERE.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.803
LIKE THEY SAY, PROTECTED
BY SMITH AND WESSON.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.638
YOU HAVE A GUN?

05:04.672 --> 05:06.374
YES, SEVERAL.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.941
ALL LEGALLY REGISTERED,
OF COURSE.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.910
JUST MAKE SURE YOU KEEP
THOSE WEAPONS SECURE.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.346
OKAY?
WHY?

05:12.380 --> 05:13.681
SO I CAN SAY,
"EXCUSE ME, MR. CRIMINAL,

05:13.714 --> 05:15.749
"COULD YOU WAIT A MOMENT
WHILE I TAKE THIS

05:15.783 --> 05:17.050
FREAKIN' SAFETY LOCK OFF?"

05:17.084 --> 05:19.587
THAT'S FOR THE HEADS-UP,
DETECTIVES,

05:19.620 --> 05:22.423
BUT I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF
TAKING CARE OF MY OWN HOME.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.791
DINNER READY?
I'M STARVED.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.694
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU
UNTIL SIX.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.362
BUT WHY DON'T YOU
RELAX WITH A DRINK

05:28.396 --> 05:29.630
WHILE I FINISH COOKING?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.098
(Brent)
FINE.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.435
IF WE DON'T STOP HIM,
THAT PRICK'S GONNA USE MIA

05:34.468 --> 05:35.669
FOR TARGET PRACTICE.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.970
HE'S GOT HER
ON A TIGHT LEASH,

05:37.004 --> 05:38.772
AND IF SHE WON'T TALK,
WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.073
MAYBE THERE'S
ANOTHER WAY.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.811
THE WALLS HAVE EARS.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.382
WELCOME!

05:48.416 --> 05:49.683
WELCOME.
THIS IS A TREAT.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.084
I'M A HUGE CRIME BUFF.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.453
SEE, OVER HERE
I HAVE EVERYTHING

05:52.486 --> 05:55.389
FROM WILKIE COLLINS
TO GEORGE PELECANOS.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.457
LINNIE!

05:56.490 --> 05:59.660
IF WE HAD A VIEW,
I'D BE WATCHING THE NEIGHBORS

05:59.693 --> 06:02.396
LIKE JIMMY STEWART
IN REAR WINDOW.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.597
AND THIS IS
MY GRACE KELLY, LINNIE.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.966
SWEETIE,
THE POLICE ARE HERE.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.501
OH, THE POLICE.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.469
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

06:08.502 --> 06:10.103
ACTUALLY, WE WANTED
TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS

06:10.137 --> 06:12.440
ABOUT YOUR UPSTAIRS
NEIGHBOR.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.474
HAS SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO MIA?

06:13.507 --> 06:14.542
(Stabler)
WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

06:14.575 --> 06:15.709
BECAUSE OF HER HUSBAND.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.179
JONAH, PLEASE.
WE CAN'T GET INVOLVED.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.881
WAS THERE A DISTURBANCE IN
THEIR APARTMENT LAST NIGHT?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.182
(Linnie)
NO.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.684
LINNIE, I'VE GOT M.S.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.553
IF YOU'VE GOT ALZHEIMER'S,
WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.854
THERE WAS
AN UNHOLY RUCKUS.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.155
IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE
MOVING FURNITURE.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.156
MAYBE THEY WERE.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.157
AT THREE
IN THE MORNING?

06:30.190 --> 06:32.726
DO THEIR FIGHTS
EVER GET PHYSICAL?

06:32.760 --> 06:33.927
SHE HAD A BROKEN ARM
LAST SPRING.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.463
SHE SAID SHE TRIPPED.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.229
HOGWASH.

06:36.263 --> 06:37.898
LINNIE, THE GIRL
NEEDS OUR HELP.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.801
AND WHO'S GONNA HELP US
IF HE KICKS US OUT?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.903
WE'LL NEVER FIND ANOTHER
RENT CONTROLLED APARTMENT

06:42.936 --> 06:44.638
THAT HAS WHEELCHAIR ACCESS.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.139
WE'D HAVE
TO LEAVE THE CITY.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.174
SWEETHEART--

06:47.207 --> 06:49.443
NO, JONAH.
I WON'T DO IT.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.580
[sighs]
I'M SORRY.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.981
MY WIFE IS AFRAID
OF EVERYTHING.

06:54.014 --> 06:57.785
SHE HASN'T LEFT MANHATTAN
IN OVER 30 YEARS.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.520
SHE'S AFRAID OF WATER.
SHE WON'T GO ACROSS A BRIDGE.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.989
MIA'S BODY IS
COVERED IN BRUISES.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.224
HUSBAND REALLY DID
A NUMBER ON HER.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.494
SHE TOLD YOU
IT WAS HER HUSBAND?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.228
NO, NO.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.198
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO SPEAK WITH HER ALONE.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.500
THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.735
THE SAME WAY YOU KNOW.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.137
THE WAY SHE FLINCHES
WHEN HE COMES TOWARD HER

07:17.170 --> 07:19.673
OR THE WAY SHE HAS
FEAR IN HER EYE

07:19.707 --> 07:20.608
WHEN HE SPEAKS.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.441
THE WAY SHE WANTS TO JUMP
OUT OF HER SKIN,

07:21.475 --> 07:23.243
SORT OF THE WAY
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.779
WELL, OF COURSE
I'M SCARED.

07:25.813 --> 07:29.182
THIS PLACE IS A GODSEND
TO ME AND JONAH.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.184
HE MOVED IN HERE
ALMOST 40 YEARS AGO,

07:31.218 --> 07:33.654
WHEN HE STARTED USING
THE WHEELCHAIR.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.823
IF WE WERE TO LOSE IT--

07:35.856 --> 07:38.826
THERE ARE LAWS THAT PROTECT
TENANTS FROM RETALIATION.

07:38.859 --> 07:42.496
BUT IF YOU DON'T HELP US,
WE CAN'T PROTECT MIA.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.136
BRENT'S A MONSTER.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.104
ALL SMILES
AND GOOD LOOKS,

07:51.138 --> 07:55.576
BUT UNDERNEATH THERE'S--
THERE'S ONLY ICE.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.710
HE HAS NO HEART.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.546
SO, YOU'VE HEARD THEM
FIGHT BEFORE?

07:58.579 --> 08:01.715
WHEN HE STARTS YELLING,
I PUT ON MY HEADPHONES.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.284
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

08:04.317 --> 08:08.756
BUT THE NEXT DAY,
I SEE THE BRUISES.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.057
SO, HELP ME HELP HER.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.731
LINNIE?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.032
IN HERE, DEAR.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.436
GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

08:23.470 --> 08:26.974
I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED HELP
GETTING JONAH OUT OF THE TUB.

08:28.576 --> 08:29.743
NO. NO.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.745
PLEASE, MIA,
TALK TO HER.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.781
I HAVE TO GO.
MIA, LISTEN TO ME.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.916
IF YOU GO BACK UPSTAIRS,
I CAN'T PROTECT YOU.

08:35.949 --> 08:36.917
I DON'T NEED PROTECTION.

08:36.950 --> 08:37.918
SWEETHEART, YOU DO.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.921
PLEASE...

08:40.954 --> 08:42.255
LET ME HELP YOU.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.829
LISTEN TO ME, MIA.

08:48.862 --> 08:53.300
LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.168
IT'S OKAY, MIA.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.739
MIA, I WANT YOU TO LOOK.
OKAY?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.977
MIA, LOOK WHAT
HE DID TO YOU.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.813
OH, MY POOR CHILD.

09:05.846 --> 09:07.147
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.550
[soft]
LOOK WHAT HE DID.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.223
HE ALWAYS SAYS
HE'S SORRY.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.692
HE BRINGS ME FLOWERS.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.060
PROMISES HE'LL
NEVER HURT YOU AGAIN.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.829
UNTIL HE DOES.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.297
LISTEN TO ME.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.866
HE'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.903
YOU HAVE TO.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.672
OKAY?

09:36.343 --> 09:40.247
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, OKAY?

09:49.923 --> 09:52.626
HE WANTED TO HAVE SEX.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.395
"LET'S MAKE A BABY,"
HE SAID,

09:55.428 --> 09:57.931
BECAUSE HE KNEW
I WAS OVULATING.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.299
HE TRACKS IT,

09:59.332 --> 10:03.070
TAKES MY TEMPERATURE
EVERY DAY.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.739
BUT, UH...

10:05.773 --> 10:08.275
HOW CAN I HAVE
A CHILD WITH HIM?

10:14.347 --> 10:16.750
I TOLD HIM
I WASN'T FEELING WELL,

10:16.784 --> 10:20.821
AND HE CALLED ME
A SELFISH BITCH,

10:20.854 --> 10:26.393
AND THEN HE STARTED
HITTING ME AND KICKING ME.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.096
AND THEN HE RAPED YOU.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.901
I'M SO SORRY
I LIED TO YOU.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.135
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.104
COME HERE.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.139
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.

10:39.172 --> 10:42.409
GO ARREST THE BASTARD.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.412
DETECTIVES?

10:45.445 --> 10:48.348
BRENT LATIMER,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR RAPE.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.050
RAPE?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.852
[sighs]
WHERE'S MY WIFE?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.721
DID YOU HEAR THAT, EL?

10:53.754 --> 10:54.521
YOU SAID RAPE,
HE SAYS WIFE.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.223
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A CONFESSION TO ME.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.826
YOU'RE MAKING
A HUGE MISTAKE, DETECTIVE.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.828
MIA WOULD NEVER SAY
A WORD AGAINST ME.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.863
YOU WANT TO BET?

11:05.065 --> 11:06.166
DOCKET ENDING
0-4-2-4,

11:06.199 --> 11:09.369
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
VERSUS BRENT LATIMER.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.939
RAPE ONE, ASSAULT TWO.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.707
HOW DOES
THE DEFENDANT PLEAD?

11:13.741 --> 11:14.742
NOT GUILTY.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.409
BAIL, MS. GREYLEK?
500,000.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.712
THAT'S PUNITIVE, YOUR HONOR.
THE PEOPLE'S CASE IS WEAK.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.113
(Greylek)
WEAK?

11:20.147 --> 11:23.383
THE VICTIM BARELY HAS
AN INCH OF UNBRUISED SKIN.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.719
THE INJURIES FULLY
CORROBORATE HER STORY.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.087
WHICH STORY?
THE ONE SHE SPUN

11:27.120 --> 11:28.455
OUT OF STRANGER RAPE,
SO SHE WOULDN'T GET ARRESTED

11:28.488 --> 11:29.790
FOR ASSAULTING A PHARMACIST?

11:29.823 --> 11:32.125
OR THE TALE OF
THE BIG BAD HUSBAND

11:32.159 --> 11:34.427
SHE SNOOKERED
DETECTIVE BENSON WITH?

11:34.461 --> 11:37.397
THAT'S WHAT THE GRAND JURY
IS FOR, MR. LANGAN.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.467
TO SORT THESE THINGS OUT.
BAIL IS SET AT 50,000.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.501
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
I'LL POST IT IMMEDIATELY.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.435
THEN THE PEOPLE REQUEST

11:42.469 --> 11:44.471
AN ORDER OF PROTECTION
BARRING THE DEFENDANT

11:44.504 --> 11:47.207
FROM CONTACT WITH THE VICTIM.
KIM?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.809
YOU'RE GONNA THROW MY CLIENT
OUT OF HIS OWN HOME?

11:48.842 --> 11:51.178
WELL, IF HE MADE BAIL,

11:51.211 --> 11:52.780
HE CAN AFFORD A HOTEL ROOM.

11:52.813 --> 11:53.814
WE ALSO REQUEST
THE DEFENDANT SURRENDER

11:53.847 --> 11:55.215
HIS FIREARMS TO THE NYPD.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.886
YOUR HONOR, I HAVE
A SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT

11:58.919 --> 12:00.520
TO BEAR ARMS.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.855
I'LL SLEEP BETTER KNOWING

12:01.889 --> 12:04.157
THEY'RE IN A GUN SAFE
AT THE PRECINCT.

12:04.191 --> 12:07.227
YOU'LL TURN THEM IN.
CALL THE NEXT CASE.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.528
[gavel bangs]

12:08.561 --> 12:09.863
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE LETTING HIM GO.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.231
MIA, HE'S NOT ALLOWED
IN THIS HOUSE.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.333
IF HE COMES WITHIN 50 FEET,
HE'LL BE ARRESTED.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.835
IF HE GETS THAT CLOSE,
I'LL BE DEAD.

12:14.868 --> 12:15.969
HE'LL SHOOT ME.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.004
WE'RE TAKING AWAY
HIS GUNS.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.371
YOU THINK THAT'S
GONNA STOP HIM?

12:18.405 --> 12:22.075
IS THERE ANY FAMILY
THAT YOU COULD STAY WITH?

12:22.109 --> 12:24.812
MY PARENTS ARE DEAD.
I'M AN ONLY CHILD.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.446
THE ONLY PEOPLE WE SEE
ARE BRENT'S FRIENDS.

12:26.479 --> 12:27.580
THEY'LL NEVER BELIEVE ME.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.217
SO, MAYBE YOU SHOULD CHECK
INTO A HOTEL FOR A FEW DAYS.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.853
I WENT TO THE GROCERY
STORE LAST NIGHT.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.054
MY CREDIT CARD
WAS CANCELLED.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.923
SO IS MY ATM CARD.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.791
BRENT CUT ME OFF
FROM ALL OUR MONEY.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.226
I THINK YOU SHOULD
GO TO A SHELTER.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.494
LIKE A HOMELESS PERSON?

12:41.528 --> 12:42.796
FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.131
THEY'LL FIND YOU
SOMEWHERE SAFE TO LIVE.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.166
OKAY, THEN WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO LIVE ON?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.234
WELFARE?

12:52.005 --> 12:55.108
I GREW UP POOR AND I MADE IT
TO THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.910
NOW, I'M BACK TO EATING
GOVERNMENT CHEESE.

12:56.944 --> 12:58.812
MIA, YOU'LL FILE
FOR DIVORCE

12:58.846 --> 13:00.380
AND YOU'LL HAVE ENOUGH
MONEY TO START OVER.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.581
NO, I WON'T.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.851
I SIGNED A PRE-NUP.

13:03.884 --> 13:07.587
I MET BRENT
WHEN I WAS 18.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.822
HE CONVINCED ME
TO DROP OUT OF COLLEGE.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.557
NO, HE MADE YOU
DEPEND ON HIM,

13:10.590 --> 13:11.859
SO HE COULD
CONTROL YOU.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.194
WELL, IT WORKED.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.363
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER
EVEN HAD A JOB.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.098
HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO LIVE?

13:18.131 --> 13:20.868
MIA, LISTEN TO ME.

13:20.901 --> 13:21.601
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY,

13:21.634 --> 13:23.837
BUT YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE A NEW LIFE.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.540
I HAD A FRIEND

13:27.574 --> 13:29.209
WHOSE HUSBAND BEAT HER.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.378
SAID IT WAS HER FAULT.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.113
IF SHE WASN'T SO STUPID
AND WORTHLESS,

13:33.146 --> 13:35.315
HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO HIT HER.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.184
AND SHE BELIEVED HIM.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.952
BUT SHE ESCAPED

13:38.986 --> 13:41.621
AND SHE FOUND
A MAN WHO WOULD--

13:41.654 --> 13:44.858
WHO WOULD RATHER DIE
THAN HURT HER.

13:44.892 --> 13:47.861
THAT'S WHAT
YOU DESERVE, MIA.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.506
SO, WHAT NOW?

13:59.539 --> 14:00.540
OKAY, YOU PACK.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.175
LET'S GET YOUR I.D.,

14:02.209 --> 14:03.576
ANY IMPORTANT PAPERS,

14:03.610 --> 14:05.445
ANYTHING THAT
CAN'T BE REPLACED.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.220
(Benson)
YOU CAN'T DISCLOSE

14:13.253 --> 14:14.587
THE LOCATION
OF THE SAFE HOUSE.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.622
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO SIGN IN AND OUT

14:15.655 --> 14:16.389
EACH TIME YOU LEAVE,

14:16.423 --> 14:18.926
BE BACK FOR CURFEW
AT 9:00 P.M.

14:21.128 --> 14:21.929
YOU'LL HAVE DAILY CHORES,

14:21.962 --> 14:23.931
PLUS GROUP AND
INDIVIDUAL THERAPY.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.534
YOU CAN'T HAVE ANY CONTACT
WITH BRENT.

14:27.567 --> 14:31.404
IF YOU DO, YOU'LL BE ASKED
TO LEAVE THE SHELTER.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.106
BRENT'S FREE,
AND I'M IN PRISON.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.474
I KNOW THAT
IT'S STRICT HERE,

14:34.507 --> 14:36.043
BUT THE RULES ARE MEANT
FOR YOUR SAFETY.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.946
I KNOW ALL ABOUT RULES.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.680
BRENT HAS LOTS OF THEM.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.682
KNOWING WHERE I AM
EVERY MINUTE.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.151
LOOKING PRETTY
ALL THE TIME.

14:44.184 --> 14:48.021
ALWAYS WEAR MAKEUP.
NO SLOPPY SWEATS.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.423
HOUSE HAS TO BE
SO CLEAN IT SPARKLES.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.128
MY DAD WAS THE SAME WAY.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.964
ALWAYS ORDERING ME AROUND.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.968
THERE'S NEVER
BEEN A TIME

15:01.001 --> 15:03.170
WHEN SOMEONE HASN'T
TOLD ME WHAT TO DO.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.277
HEY, HOW'D IT GO
WITH MIA?

15:10.310 --> 15:11.478
LOUSY.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.580
SHE'S IN A SHELTER,
BUT I PUSHED HER INTO IT.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.514
THAT'S BETTER
THAN STAYING HOME

15:14.547 --> 15:16.483
BEING A SITTING DUCK
FOR MR. GUNS AND AMMO.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.218
IT SHOULD HAVE
BEEN HER CHOICE.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.686
NOT ME TELLING HER WHAT
TO DO LIKE HER BATTERER.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.021
SHE'S IN NO SHAPE
TO MAKE ANY DECISION.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.522
SHE NEEDED YOUR HELP.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.457
SO, NOW SHE'S SAFE AND
BRENT'S GOING TO PRISON.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.493
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.028
MIA CAME TO ME AND
RECANTED THE CHARGES

15:28.061 --> 15:29.729
AGAINST MY CLIENT.
ON VIDEO.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.198
BRENT MUST HAVE
GOTTEN TO HER.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.599
NO, HER GUILTY
CONSCIOUS DID.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.701
LET'S GO PLAY THIS FOR GREYLEK
AND DROP THE CHARGES.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.970
I'M TALKING
TO MIA FIRST.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.605
GO AHEAD.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.540
SHE'S AT HOME
WITH HER HUSBAND.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.178
GOOD MORNING, DETECTIVE.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.179
BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT?

15:46.213 --> 15:47.180
WHERE'S MIA?

15:47.214 --> 15:48.348
SHE'S MAKING ME BRUNCH.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.083
WE'RE HAVING
A LAZY DAY IN BED.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.084
SO LONG.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.552
I NEED TO TALK TO HER.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.654
I HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT
TO CHECK ON HER WELL-BEING,

15:54.687 --> 15:57.057
SO INTERFERE AND
I WILL ARREST YOU

15:57.090 --> 15:58.058
FOR OBSTRUCTION.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.692
YOU'RE A PIECE OF WORK.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.195
WHY? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
ORDER ME AROUND?

16:07.200 --> 16:08.435
MIA, COME HERE!

16:10.670 --> 16:12.005
PLEASE.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.176
HEY.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.611
MIA, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

16:18.645 --> 16:21.181
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.650
YOU DON'T LOOK FINE.
COME HERE.

16:23.683 --> 16:27.420
LOOK, MIA, MAYBE THE SHELTER
WASN'T THE BEST WAY TO GO,

16:27.454 --> 16:30.390
BUT I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
THAT WE CAN KEEP YOU SAFE.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.059
I WANT TO BE HOME
WITH MY HUSBAND.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.260
SATISFIED?

16:35.562 --> 16:37.597
THINK ABOUT THIS.
ARE YOU SURE?

16:37.630 --> 16:40.033
I MADE A MISTAKE,

16:40.067 --> 16:45.472
BUT BRENT FORGAVE ME
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GET ON

16:45.505 --> 16:46.673
WITH OUR LIVES.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.776
AND OUR BREAKFAST.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.645
GOOD-BYE, DETECTIVE.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.184
OH, AND TELL YOUR PARTNER

16:57.217 --> 16:59.486
I'D LIKE MY GUNS BACK.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.754
HE CAN DROP THEM
OFF ANY TIME.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.362
LINNIE?

17:10.830 --> 17:13.166
LINNIE.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.668
I'M SORRY.
JONAH LET ME IN.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.437
SO MUCH FOR HELPING MIA.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.072
LOOK, SHE WASN'T READY
TO LEAVE HER HUSBAND.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.740
I PUSHED HER.
IT WAS MY FAULT.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.709
OH, SPARE ME
THE SELF-PITY.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.278
LINNIE, I KNOW THAT YOU CARE
ABOUT MIA'S SAFETY.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.347
WELL, WHAT'S THE USE?
SHE DOESN'T CARE.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.651
WHERE DOES THAT
STAIRCASE LEAD?

17:31.684 --> 17:34.221
TO MIA'S KITCHEN.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.822
IT'S THE OLD
SERVANTS' STEPS.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.590
WHEN THEY CONVERTED
THE HOUSE INTO APARTMENTS,

17:37.624 --> 17:39.592
THEY LEFT IT IN.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.128
WE SHARE THE LAUNDRY.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.266
YOU'RE NOT STAYING HERE.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.236
IT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT
I CAN PROTECT HER.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.838
SHE MADE HER BED.
SHE'LL HAVE TO LIE IN IT.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.106
GO HOME, DETECTIVE.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.843
YOU TOLD MIA
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND

17:56.876 --> 17:58.678
WHO WAS BATTERED.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.313
DID YOU HELP HER LEAVE?

18:00.347 --> 18:02.315
NO.

18:02.349 --> 18:05.785
SHE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE
WHAT HE DID TO HER.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.587
SHE WENT THROUGH HELL
TO GET OUT.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.356
SO IF YOU HAD KNOWN,

18:09.389 --> 18:12.125
WOULDN'T YOU HAVE DONE ANYTHING
YOU COULD TO PROTECT HER?

18:26.406 --> 18:27.507
[sighs]

18:27.540 --> 18:29.409
(Brent)
DON'T YOU RUN FROM ME!

18:29.442 --> 18:30.843
YOU MADE A MISTAKE, AND NOW
YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.545
NOW GET ON YOUR KNEES!

18:32.579 --> 18:34.181
(Mia)
BRENT, PLEASE,
I SAID I'M SORRY!

18:34.214 --> 18:35.782
SORRY?
YOU'RE SORRY?!

18:35.815 --> 18:37.284
SORRY'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!
LET GO OF ME!

18:37.317 --> 18:38.918
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO!

18:38.951 --> 18:40.820
YOU STUPID--

18:40.853 --> 18:43.190
AAH!

18:44.924 --> 18:46.359
OH, MY GOD.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.427
PUT YOUR HANDS
ON YOUR HEAD!

18:47.460 --> 18:48.595
I DIDN'T--

18:48.628 --> 18:50.363
SHE--
SHE ATTACKED ME!

18:50.397 --> 18:51.864
SHE ATTACKED ME, OKAY?

18:51.898 --> 18:55.235
GET ON THE FLOOR!
FACE DOWN!

18:55.268 --> 18:56.903
LINNIE, CALL 911!

18:58.438 --> 19:00.340
CALL 911!

19:00.373 --> 19:01.608
MIA!

19:01.641 --> 19:04.344
MIA, HANG ON!
YOU HANG ON!

19:04.377 --> 19:06.379
OH, GOD.
OH, GOD.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.633
(Cragen)
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.968
HOW DO YOU THINK?

19:29.001 --> 19:31.238
YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU COULD.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.940
I COULD HAVE COLLARED HER
FOR FILING A FALSE RAPE REPORT.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.875
I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU
LOCK UP A VICTIM.

19:35.908 --> 19:36.876
AT LEAST SHE'D
STILL BE ALIVE.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.246
FOR HOW LONG?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.713
SOONER OR LATER,
SHE WOULD HAVE

19:40.747 --> 19:42.882
GONE BACK TO HIM.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.251
MIA MADE HER CHOICE, LIV.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.652
ARE YOU SAYING
IT'S HER FAULT?

19:45.685 --> 19:46.953
NO.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.789
BUT IT'S NOT
YOURS EITHER.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.193
COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.567
(Linnie)
WAS IT WORTH IT, OLIVIA?

20:00.600 --> 20:01.834
(Jonah)
LINNIE, STOP IT.

20:01.868 --> 20:02.869
LIV, DON'T.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.573
YOU COULDN'T
LEAVE HER ALONE.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.607
LINNIE--

20:07.640 --> 20:08.975
YOU JUST PUSHED
AND PUSHED.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.278
AND FOR WHAT?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.512
THAT?

20:18.017 --> 20:21.621
DETECTIVE,

20:21.654 --> 20:23.823
DON'T LET HIM
GET AWAY WITH IT.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.003
SO HOW'S IT LOOK?
MY EVIDENCE SOLID?

20:37.036 --> 20:37.937
LIKE A ROCK.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.773
AND WARNER DID
A SUSPECT KIT ON LATIMER,

20:40.807 --> 20:42.275
HE DIDN'T HAVE
A SCRATCH ON HIM.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.010
HE CAN'T CLAIM
SELF-DEFENSE.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.412
BRENT LATIMER IS
GOING AWAY FOR LIFE,

20:45.445 --> 20:47.914
AND YOU MIGHT EVEN CLOSE
ANOTHER MURDER.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.449
HE'S KILLED BEFORE?

20:49.482 --> 20:52.385
NOT UNLESS HE STARTED YOUNG
AND HAD A SEX CHANGE.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.854
WE FOUND FINGERPRINTS
ON THE KITCHEN PHONE

20:54.887 --> 20:56.055
THAT MATCH
AN OLD HOMICIDE.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.391
IN 1974, A GUY NAMED
VINCENT CRESSWELL

20:58.425 --> 20:59.726
WAS SHOT SIX TIMES
IN HIS SLEEP

20:59.759 --> 21:01.027
IN HIS APARTMENT
IN GREENWICH VILLAGE.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.897
HIS WIFE CAROLINE WAS
ARRESTED AT THE SCENE.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.633
SHE ESCAPED
JUST BEFORE TRIAL.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.935
SHE'S BEEN A FUGITIVE
SINCE THE EARLY SEVENTIES.

21:11.070 --> 21:16.843
I'VE BEEN DREADING THIS
FOR 34 YEARS.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.378
(Jonah)
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:20.413 --> 21:24.317
LINNIE?
WHAT'S THAT?

21:24.351 --> 21:25.685
YOU NEVER TOLD HIM?

21:25.718 --> 21:26.719
TOLD ME WHAT?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.624
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.726
WHEN WERE YOU ARRESTED?

21:33.760 --> 21:34.827
1974.

21:34.861 --> 21:37.797
WE WERE LIVING
TOGETHER IN '74.

21:37.830 --> 21:41.868
I MET YOU THREE WEEKS
AFTER I ESCAPED FROM JAIL.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.337
ESCAPED?

21:44.371 --> 21:48.341
I HAD NOWHERE TO GO.

21:48.375 --> 21:54.046
I SLEPT IN CHURCHES,
ON THE SUBWAY.

21:54.080 --> 21:59.919
I STOLE FOOD,
EVEN A WALLET.

21:59.952 --> 22:03.690
AND ONE NIGHT
IT WAS POURING,

22:03.723 --> 22:06.393
AND I WENT INTO A DINER

22:06.426 --> 22:10.363
AND SPENT MY LAST DOLLAR
ON A BOWL OF SOUP

22:10.397 --> 22:12.932
TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.066
I REMEMBER HER
SITTING THERE.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.370
WET, COLD, SHIVERING.

22:17.404 --> 22:21.408
SHE TOLD ME SHE'D JUST
ARRIVED ON VACATION.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.976
SHE SAID A CON MAN HAD
HUSTLED HER AT THE AIRPORT.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.845
LOST HER SUITCASE,
HER MONEY,

22:25.878 --> 22:28.448
AND ALL HER I.D.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.950
JONAH TOOK ME HOME.
HE SAVED MY LIFE.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.553
I HAD NO MONEY
NO FRIENDS.

22:33.586 --> 22:35.121
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT SUICIDE.

22:35.154 --> 22:39.125
AND THEN THERE HE WAS,
KIND AND GENEROUS,

22:39.158 --> 22:40.460
LIKE THE ANSWER
TO A PRAYER.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.630
AND YOU NEVER TOLD HIM
ABOUT YOUR PAST.

22:43.663 --> 22:44.564
SHE WAS LIKE A CHARACTER
OUT OF DICKENS.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.967
SHE HAD NO FAMILY,
GREW UP IN AN ORPHANAGE.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.736
MY PARENTS DISOWNED ME
WHEN I WAS ARRESTED.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.871
I COULDN'T GO HOME.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.940
JONAH IS ALL I HAVE.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.442
DID YOU EVER
WANT CHILDREN?

22:55.475 --> 22:58.077
WE TRIED FOR YEARS,
LINNIE COULDN'T GET PREGNANT.

22:58.110 --> 23:01.781
SHE SAW A DOCTOR
WHO TOLD HER SHE WAS INFERTILE.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.149
I WAS ON THE PILL.

23:03.182 --> 23:06.653
OH, I WANTED A BABY,
BUT IF I WAS CAUGHT

23:06.686 --> 23:09.789
I'D BE SENT BACK TO JAIL
AND LOSE MY CHILD.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.191
EVERY CHOICE I MADE
WAS OUT OF FEAR.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.026
WOULD SOMEBODY
RECOGNIZE ME?

23:14.060 --> 23:15.962
WOULD TODAY
BE THE DAY?

23:15.995 --> 23:17.897
SHE COULDN'T TRAVEL
BECAUSE SHE'D NEED I.D.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.666
SHE COULDN'T WORK WITHOUT
A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.

23:19.699 --> 23:25.672
MY GOD.
IS OUR MARRIAGE EVEN LEGAL?

23:25.705 --> 23:28.541
I DON'T KNOW
HER REAL NAME.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.611
MY NAME IS LINNIE MALCOLM.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.213
CAROLINE CRESSWELL DIED
A LONG TIME AGO.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.983
RIGHT AFTER
VINCENT CRESSWELL DIED.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.818
SO, TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

23:38.851 --> 23:42.589
WE MET WHEN I WAS 17

23:42.622 --> 23:44.524
AT AN ANTI-WAR PROTEST.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.862
VINCENT WAS STANDING
ON THE STAGE,

23:49.896 --> 23:51.964
RECITING HIS POETRY.

23:53.800 --> 23:58.170
IT WASN'T VERY GOOD,
BUT OH,

23:58.204 --> 24:01.508
HE WAS SO--

24:01.541 --> 24:03.042
SO PASSIONATE.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.681
I FELL IN LOVE.

24:08.715 --> 24:11.584
WITH HIM,
AND THE MOVEMENT.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.720
AND AFTER
THE VIETNAM WAR ENDED?

24:13.753 --> 24:15.154
THE WORLD MOVED ON.

24:15.187 --> 24:20.259
BUT VINCENT, HE COULDN'T.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.094
HE WAS STILL ANGRY,

24:22.128 --> 24:25.665
AND NO ONE WANTED
BITTER POEMS.

24:25.698 --> 24:29.969
NO ONE LISTENED, SO...

24:30.002 --> 24:32.038
HE TOOK IT OUT ON ME.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.806
SO, YOU FOUGHT?

24:33.840 --> 24:36.208
CONSTANTLY.

24:36.242 --> 24:40.246
THE REJECTION LETTERS
KEPT COMING AND...

24:40.279 --> 24:43.916
WELL, HE BLAMED ME.
HE SAID I WAS--

24:43.950 --> 24:47.253
HE SAID I WAS
STIFLING HIS MUSE.

24:47.286 --> 24:52.825
I WAS DULL,
UGLY, BORING.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.261
IT WASN'T ME.
IT WAS--

24:55.294 --> 24:57.697
IT WAS THE DRUGS
AND THE BOOZE.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.600
I MEAN, HE COULD BARELY WALK,
LET ALONE WRITE.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.268
DID HE BEAT YOU?

25:02.301 --> 25:03.002
ALL THE TIME.

25:03.035 --> 25:07.139
MOSTLY IT WAS
JUST BRUISES.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.143
AN OCCASIONAL BLACK EYE.

25:13.613 --> 25:19.719
ONE TIME HE CHOKED ME
UNTIL I PASSED OUT,

25:19.752 --> 25:21.821
AND THEN HE BOUGHT THE GUN.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.093
DID HE THREATEN
YOU WITH IT?

25:27.126 --> 25:29.729
WHEN HE WAS DRUNK,

25:29.762 --> 25:33.633
HE WOULD TALK
ABOUT SUICIDE.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.869
AND THEN ONE DAY

25:36.903 --> 25:39.606
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA SHOOT ME
AND THEN KILL HIMSELF,

25:39.639 --> 25:42.308
AND I KNOW HE MEANT IT.

25:42.341 --> 25:46.613
HE WAS IN THIS
DOWNWARD SPIRAL AND--

25:46.646 --> 25:48.147
AND HE WAS GONNA
TAKE ME WITH HIM.

25:48.180 --> 25:49.849
WHY DIDN'T YOU LEAVE?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.283
I WAS PLANNING TO.

25:51.317 --> 25:54.353
I'D BEEN STASHING AWAY CHANGE
FROM THE GROCERIES.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.256
I KEPT IT HIDDEN
IN A SHOE.

25:57.289 --> 26:01.628
I HAD ALMOST $50.

26:01.661 --> 26:05.031
WHEN HE FOUND IT,

26:05.064 --> 26:07.099
HE SAID I MUST BE
SELLING MYSELF

26:07.133 --> 26:10.169
TO HAVE SO MUCH MONEY,

26:10.202 --> 26:14.306
AND IF WANTED
TO BE A WHORE,

26:14.340 --> 26:16.976
HE WAS GONNA
TREAT ME LIKE ONE.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.646
HE RAPED YOU.

26:25.351 --> 26:29.889
[sniffling]
OVER...AND OVER.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.998
[crying]
HE DID EVERY VILE THING

26:39.031 --> 26:41.834
THAT HE COULD THINK OF.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.640
AND THEN HE WENT TO SLEEP.

26:49.842 --> 26:56.282
SO, I TOOK THAT GUN
FROM UNDER HIS PILLOW,

26:56.315 --> 26:58.651
AND I SHOT HIM.

27:04.924 --> 27:08.127
[sniffles]
I DON'T KNOW

27:08.160 --> 27:11.397
HOW LONG I STOOD THERE
LOOKING AT HIS BODY.

27:14.100 --> 27:18.004
I HEARD THE SIREN.

27:18.037 --> 27:24.677
I KNEW THE NEIGHBORS
HAD CALLED THE POLICE.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.112
I STILL HAD THE GUN
IN MY HAND

27:26.145 --> 27:29.248
WHEN THEY BROKE--
BROKE DOWN THE DOOR.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.383
DID YOU TELL THEM
THAT HE RAPED YOU?

27:38.925 --> 27:44.230
[sniffles]
UNTIL NOW...

27:44.263 --> 27:48.067
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.102
[sobbing]

27:54.340 --> 27:57.744
MARITAL RAPE WASN'T
A CRIME UNTIL 1984.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.912
TODAY, IT WOULD BE
RULED SELF-DEFENSE.

27:59.946 --> 28:02.381
WE WOULDN'T
EVEN CHARGE HER.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.483
SHE'LL HAVE TO FACE
THE ORIGINAL INDICTMENT,

28:04.516 --> 28:06.385
BUT IF WE CAN
CORROBORATE HER STORY,

28:06.418 --> 28:08.154
SHE'S PROBABLY LOOKING
AT PROBATION.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.789
(Donnelly)
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.058
JUDGE DONNELLY.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.359
NOT ANYMORE.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.727
I'VE TAKEN
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE

28:14.761 --> 28:15.862
TO RETURN
TO THE D.A.'S OFFICE.

28:15.895 --> 28:17.864
WHY?

28:17.897 --> 28:22.434
UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

28:22.468 --> 28:26.472
HELLO, CAROLINE.

28:26.505 --> 28:27.706
REMEMBER ME?

28:31.443 --> 28:33.412
YOU WERE THE PROSECUTOR
ON MY CASE.

28:33.445 --> 28:34.413
I STILL AM.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.983
ARREST HER.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.450
THE CHARGE IS ESCAPE
IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

28:38.484 --> 28:39.518
YOUR HONOR--

28:39.551 --> 28:41.387
IF YOU WON'T DO IT,

28:41.420 --> 28:43.289
I'LL BRING IN ANOTHER DETECTIVE
WHO ISN'T PERSONALLY INVOLVED.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.391
YOUR CHOICE.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.762
STAND UP.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.431
(Benson)
LINNIE MALCOLM--

28:52.464 --> 28:54.066
HER NAME IS
CAROLINE CRESSWELL.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.869
CAROLINE CRESSWELL,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

28:56.903 --> 28:58.270
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

28:58.304 --> 28:59.305
ANYTHING YOU SAY

28:59.338 --> 29:00.439
CAN AND WILL BE
USED AGAINST YOU

29:00.472 --> 29:01.774
IN A COURT OF LAW.

29:01.808 --> 29:02.975
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.010
IF YOU CANNOT
AFFORD ONE,

29:04.043 --> 29:06.045
ONE WILL BE
APPOINTED TO YOU.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.180
DOCKET ENDING
1-1-1-6,

29:08.214 --> 29:09.816
PEOPLE OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK

29:09.849 --> 29:13.485
VERSUS CAROLINE CRESSWELL
AKA LINNIE MALCOLM.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.021
ONE COUNT MURDER
IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

29:15.054 --> 29:16.823
ONE COUNT ESCAPE.

29:16.856 --> 29:17.990
HOW DOES
THE DEFENDANT PLEAD?

29:18.024 --> 29:19.091
NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.093
I ASSUME THE PEOPLE
REQUEST REMAND?

29:21.127 --> 29:23.129
UNLESS YOU WANT TO GIVE HER
ANOTHER 34 YEARS

29:23.162 --> 29:24.396
ON THE LAM.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.932
YOUR HONOR, WE REQUEST
HOME CONFINEMENT.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.000
WITH ELECTRONIC MONITORING.

29:28.034 --> 29:30.903
MY CLIENT IS HER HUSBAND'S
SOLE CARETAKER.

29:30.937 --> 29:34.006
HIS DISABILITY REQUIRES
ROUND-THE-CLOCK ASSISTANCE.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.007
HIRE A NURSE.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.308
SHE WON'T SHOOT HIM
IN HIS SLEEP.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.510
ELIZABETH,

29:38.544 --> 29:40.212
I EXPECT BETTER OF YOU.

29:40.246 --> 29:43.382
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
REMAND IS APPROPRIATE.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.017
ANY MOTION PRACTICE?

29:45.051 --> 29:48.988
NOTICE THAT WE WILL BE PURSUING
AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.123
MY CLIENT WAS
A BATTERED WOMAN

29:51.157 --> 29:52.124
WHO USED REASONABLE FORCE
TO PROTECT HERSELF

29:52.158 --> 29:53.960
AGAINST IMMINENT DANGER.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.028
A SLEEPING MAN POSES
IMMINENT DANGER?

29:56.062 --> 29:59.198
HE BEAT MY CLIENT
ON A DAILY BASIS.

29:59.231 --> 30:00.266
CAN YOU PROVIDE
DOCUMENTATION,

30:00.299 --> 30:02.869
PHOTOGRAPHS, MEDICAL RECORDS,
EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY?

30:02.902 --> 30:04.904
SHE NEVER DISCLOSED
THE ABUSE.

30:04.937 --> 30:05.972
(Donnelly)
BECAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.273
THE VICTIM HAD
NO HISTORY OF VIOLENCE

30:07.306 --> 30:10.042
TOWARD HIS WIFE
OR ANYONE ELSE.

30:10.076 --> 30:11.844
TO HAVE
HIS REPUTATION SMEARED

30:11.878 --> 30:12.912
BY HIS MURDERER
IS REPUGNANT.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.380
SAVE YOUR MORAL OUTRAGE

30:14.413 --> 30:15.481
FOR THE JURY.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.317
I'LL ALLOW THE DEFENSE.
ANYTHING ELSE?

30:18.350 --> 30:20.853
NEXT CASE.

30:20.887 --> 30:21.888
[gavel bangs]

30:24.190 --> 30:27.026
COME TO SHOW ME
THE ERROR OF MY WAYS?

30:27.059 --> 30:31.230
YOU'VE SPENT YOUR ENTIRE CAREER
PROTECTING ABUSED WOMEN

30:31.263 --> 30:33.900
AND NOW YOU'RE
GOING AFTER ONE.

30:33.933 --> 30:34.901
YOU DON'T KNOW,
DO YOU?

30:34.934 --> 30:36.102
KNOW WHAT?

30:37.436 --> 30:41.307
DID YOU ASK LINNIE
HOW SHE ESCAPED?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.976
NO.
DOES IT MATTER?

30:44.010 --> 30:46.478
SHE ASKED FOR A MEETING
TO DISCUSS A PLEA BARGAIN.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.948
I LET HER USE THE BATHROOM,
SHE CRAWLED OUT THE WINDOW.

30:48.981 --> 30:51.017
SO, YOU TOOK THE FALL.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.319
FOR YEARS,

30:53.352 --> 30:55.121
WHENEVER A ROOKIE A.D.A.
PULLED A STUPID MOVE

30:55.154 --> 30:57.023
IT WAS KNOWN AS
DOING A DONNELLY.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.193
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

31:01.227 --> 31:03.996
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT
BACK IN THOSE DAYS.

31:04.030 --> 31:06.966
I FOUGHT TO GET ASSIGNED
TO THE HOMICIDE BUREAU,

31:06.999 --> 31:09.468
BUT THE D.A. DIDN'T THINK

31:09.501 --> 31:11.037
IT WAS A SUITABLE JOB
FOR A WOMAN.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.572
SO, WHAT MADE HIM
CHANGE HIS MIND?

31:13.605 --> 31:14.573
WELL, HE KNEW
A MALE PROSECUTOR

31:14.606 --> 31:16.508
BEATING UP ON POOR
LITTLE CAROLINE CRESSWELL

31:16.542 --> 31:18.110
WOULD GET SYMPATHY POINTS
WITH THE JURY,

31:18.144 --> 31:21.113
SO HE GAVE ME THE CASE.

31:21.147 --> 31:24.483
AFTER HE CALLED
MY HUSBAND

31:24.516 --> 31:26.652
AND ASKED
FOR HIS PERMISSION.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.587
SO ALL OF THIS BECAUSE
SHE MADE YOU LOOK BAD?

31:28.620 --> 31:29.655
SHE MADE ME LOOK
LIKE A FOOL,

31:29.688 --> 31:32.058
AND SHE SET BACK THE IMAGE
OF WOMEN PROSECUTORS.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.226
I NEVER MADE IT BACK
TO THE HOMICIDE BUREAU.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.028
YOU WANT REVENGE.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.097
PLEASE.
[scoffs]

31:38.130 --> 31:40.499
I GOT OVER BEING BITTER
A LONG TIME AGO.

31:40.532 --> 31:43.569
I'M SPEAKING FOR THE VICTIM,
VINCENT CRESSWELL.

31:43.602 --> 31:44.603
THAT MAN BEAT
THE CRAP OUT OF HER

31:44.636 --> 31:46.973
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

31:47.006 --> 31:48.674
SHE HAD NOWHERE TO TURN.

31:48.707 --> 31:51.010
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE
BATTERED WOMAN SHELTER

31:51.043 --> 31:53.079
IN THE CITY, NOT TO MENTION
THAT RAPING YOUR WIFE

31:53.112 --> 31:54.380
WASN'T A CRIME.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.116
YOU DON'T NEED
TO REMIND ME

31:57.149 --> 31:59.085
HOW HARD IT WAS
FOR WOMEN.

32:05.191 --> 32:09.095
LINNIE SNOWED YOU, OLIVIA,
BUT DON'T FEEL BAD.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.562
SHE SNOWED ME, TOO.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.004
"DEAR MS. DONNELLY,

32:18.037 --> 32:20.973
"PLEASE HELP ME.

32:21.007 --> 32:23.642
"I WANT TO PLEAD GUILTY,
BUT I HAVE A TERRIBLE PROBLEM

32:23.675 --> 32:27.013
"AND ONLY YOU
CAN SAVE ME.

32:27.046 --> 32:29.148
I HAVE TO SPEAK WITH YOU
IN PRIVATE."

32:31.650 --> 32:33.019
SO WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?

32:33.052 --> 32:35.221
IT WAS A RUSE
TO GET ME

32:35.254 --> 32:37.023
TO BRING HER DOWN
TO MY OFFICE.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.525
I WANTED TO HELP HER,
JUST LIKE YOU DO.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.728
LINNIE PLAYS THE VICTIM
QUITE WELL.

32:42.761 --> 32:46.065
BUT SHE'S REALLY
A VERY SMART,

32:46.098 --> 32:48.700
MANIPULATIVE WOMAN.

32:55.241 --> 32:58.544
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, OLIVIA?

32:58.577 --> 33:00.212
THE TRUTH.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.214
I'VE TOLD YOU EVERYTHING.

33:02.248 --> 33:04.050
NO, YOU HAVEN'T.

33:04.083 --> 33:07.086
WHY DID YOU ESCAPE?

33:07.119 --> 33:09.155
I DIDN'T PLAN TO.

33:09.188 --> 33:14.193
THERE I WAS IN THE BATHROOM,
AND THE WINDOW WAS OPEN.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.494
SO IT JUST HAPPENED.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.663
YES.

33:17.696 --> 33:21.167
WELL, THEN, WHY DID YOU
WRITE THIS LETTER TO DONNELLY?

33:21.200 --> 33:23.402
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT

33:23.435 --> 33:25.737
THAT YOU HAD TO MEET
WITH HER ALONE?

33:25.771 --> 33:27.339
DON'T REMEMBER.

33:27.373 --> 33:30.742
THEN YOU'RE GONNA GO TO JAIL
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.079
THAT'S WHAT I DESERVE.

33:33.112 --> 33:36.182
I SHOT A MAN SIX TIMES
IN COLD BLOOD.

33:36.215 --> 33:39.085
IN SELF-DEFENSE,
LINNIE.

33:39.118 --> 33:42.188
LINNIE, I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU CARED ABOUT MIA.

33:42.221 --> 33:45.457
AND I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE YOUR HUSBAND.

33:47.493 --> 33:50.696
AND A COLD-BLOODED KILLER
ISN'T CAPABLE OF THAT.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.765
YOU HAVE TO TELL THE JURY
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

33:53.799 --> 33:54.800
NO.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.535
WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY,
LINNIE?

33:56.568 --> 34:00.206
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

34:05.277 --> 34:08.314
WELL, IF YOU WON'T
HELP YOURSELF,

34:08.347 --> 34:12.118
THEN DO IT FOR JONAH.

34:12.151 --> 34:13.219
HE WON'T FORGIVE ME.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.386
HE LOVES YOU, LINNIE.

34:14.420 --> 34:18.557
BUT YOU'VE BEEN LYING
TO HIM FOR 34 YEARS.

34:18.590 --> 34:22.528
DOESN'T HE DESERVE TO KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY?

34:30.436 --> 34:33.672
AFTER VINCENT RAPED ME...

34:36.742 --> 34:39.678
I WAS CRYING...

34:39.711 --> 34:44.116
AND HE TOLD ME TO SHUT UP
SO HE COULD GET SOME SLEEP.

34:46.152 --> 34:49.388
HE PUT THE GUN
UNDER HIS PILLOW,

34:49.421 --> 34:53.892
AND HE SAID HE KNEW
I LIKED IT.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.762
AND IF I WAS A GOOD GIRL,

34:56.795 --> 34:59.298
HE WAS GONNA GIVE ME
SOME MORE

34:59.331 --> 35:01.300
IN THE MORNING.

35:01.333 --> 35:04.470
AND I COULD HEAR HIM
BREATHING SOFTLY,

35:04.503 --> 35:07.906
LIKE A BABY.

35:07.939 --> 35:12.811
WHAT HE DID TO ME
DIDN'T BOTHER HIM A BIT.

35:12.844 --> 35:16.182
HE WAS RELAXED.

35:16.215 --> 35:18.617
HURTING ME WAS
THE ONLY THING

35:18.650 --> 35:22.821
THAT MADE HIM FEEL GOOD.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.491
AND I PULLED THE TRIGGER.

35:27.259 --> 35:33.765
I KEPT SEEING HIM SLAP ME
AND KICK ME...

35:33.799 --> 35:37.269
AND RAPE ME.

35:37.303 --> 35:41.240
AND I KEPT SHOOTING...

35:41.273 --> 35:44.843
UNTIL THOSE IMAGES
WENT AWAY.

35:44.876 --> 35:48.447
THE NEXT THING
I REMEMBER

35:48.480 --> 35:52.384
WAS THE BLOOD EVERYWHERE.

35:55.621 --> 35:58.557
THANK YOU, LINNIE.
NOTHING FURTHER.

35:58.590 --> 36:02.694
SO YOU WERE SCARED
AND YOU SHOT HIM.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.296
YES.

36:04.330 --> 36:08.534
DID YOU TELL THE POLICE
THAT HE BEAT YOU?

36:08.567 --> 36:11.270
THEY COULD SEE
THE BRUISES.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.439
THEY DIDN'T DOCUMENT THEM
IN THE ARREST REPORT.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.442
DID--DID YOU TELL THEM
THAT YOU'D BEEN RAPED?

36:16.475 --> 36:17.609
NO.

36:17.643 --> 36:19.411
MAYBE IF THERE'D BEEN
A WOMAN THERE--

36:19.445 --> 36:20.446
BUT OF COURSE,

36:20.479 --> 36:23.382
THERE WERE NO FEMALE
POLICE OFFICERS IN THOSE DAYS.

36:23.415 --> 36:28.654
HMM, YOUR STORY IS
VERY CONVENIENT.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.989
IT TUGS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS.

36:31.022 --> 36:33.825
BUT...THERE'S NO PROOF.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.427
IT'S THE TRUTH.

36:35.461 --> 36:38.297
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL THAT
TO A JURY 34 YEARS AGO?

36:40.432 --> 36:45.437
WE'RE ALL WAITING.

36:45.471 --> 36:48.240
(judge)
PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION.

36:48.274 --> 36:49.641
I CAN'T.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.410
(Donnelly)
YOU MEAN YOU WON'T.

36:51.443 --> 36:54.880
YOU RAN BECAUSE YOU KNEW
YOU'D BE CONVICTED.

36:54.913 --> 36:59.285
THERE WAS NO BEATING.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.453
NO RAPE.

37:01.487 --> 37:05.291
NO SELF-DEFENSE.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.359
YOU'RE GUILTY,
AND YOU KNEW IT.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.531
I WAS PREGNANT.

37:12.564 --> 37:16.435
(Donnelly)
OH, SO NOW HORMONES
MADE YOU DO IT.

37:16.468 --> 37:17.736
DID THEY MAKE YOU RUN TOO?

37:17.769 --> 37:21.507
I RAN SO I COULD GET
AN ABORTION.

37:21.540 --> 37:25.477
I COULDN'T GET AN ABORTION
IN PRISON.

37:25.511 --> 37:29.981
AND I--
I COULDN'T HAVE THAT BABY.

37:30.015 --> 37:34.820
I DIDN'T CARE IF I SPENT
THE REST OF MY LIFE IN JAIL!

37:34.853 --> 37:38.557
BUT THE THOUGHT OF HIS CHILD

37:38.590 --> 37:41.827
GROWING INSIDE ME...

37:41.860 --> 37:47.433
THAT'S WHY I CAME
TO SEE YOU.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.068
TO SAY I'D PLEAD GUILTY

37:50.101 --> 37:55.307
IF I COULD JUST
END THE PREGNANCY FIRST.

37:55.341 --> 37:57.343
BUT YOU...

37:57.376 --> 38:01.413
ARE SO STRONG.

38:01.447 --> 38:05.851
SO SELF-CONFIDENT.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.924
I WAS ASHAMED...

38:12.958 --> 38:15.894
OF MY WEAKNESS.

38:19.498 --> 38:23.569
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

38:23.602 --> 38:30.476
HOW COULD A WOMAN LIKE YOU
EVER UNDERSTAND...

38:30.509 --> 38:32.744
A WOMAN LIKE ME?

38:38.650 --> 38:40.386
(judge)
HAS THE JURY REACHED
A VERDICT?

38:40.419 --> 38:41.620
(man)
WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.689
(judge)
WILL THE DEFENDANT PLEASE RISE.

38:43.722 --> 38:46.358
AS TO THE FIRST COUNT
OF THE INDICTMENT,

38:46.392 --> 38:48.126
MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

38:48.159 --> 38:49.495
HOW DO YOU FIND THE DEFENDANT?

38:49.528 --> 38:50.962
NOT GUILTY.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.667
AS TO THE SECOND COUNT
OF THE INDICTMENT,

38:55.701 --> 38:58.737
ESCAPE IN THE FIRST DEGREE,

38:58.770 --> 39:00.606
WHAT IS YOUR VERDICT?

39:00.639 --> 39:02.941
(man)
GUILTY.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.410
(judge)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,

39:04.443 --> 39:05.611
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.546
YOU ARE EXCUSED.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.080
I'LL SEE YOU IN TWO WEEKS
FOR SENTENCING.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.517
AT WHICH TIME, YOUR HONOR,

39:11.550 --> 39:13.519
THE PEOPLE WILL BE
RECOMMENDING PROBATION.

39:13.552 --> 39:16.121
(judge)
I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING
YOUR REASONING, ELIZABETH,

39:16.154 --> 39:18.757
BUT I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU.
[gavel bangs]

39:27.433 --> 39:29.501
WHY?

39:29.535 --> 39:33.104
BECAUSE BACK THEN,

39:33.138 --> 39:35.607
I WAS TRYING SO HARD
TO BE ONE OF THE BOYS,

39:35.641 --> 39:37.976
I FORGOT WHY
I BECAME A LAWYER.

39:41.980 --> 39:43.482
THANK YOU.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.583
AND THANK YOU.

39:44.616 --> 39:47.118
YOU'LL BE HOME
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.621
JONAH,

39:49.655 --> 39:52.057
IT'S OVER.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.392
IT'S OVER.

39:57.529 --> 40:00.532
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, LINNIE,
BUT, UH...

40:00.566 --> 40:02.501
OH, NO.

40:02.534 --> 40:05.136
PLEASE DON'T SAY IT.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.673
WHEN DID YOU HAVE...
THE ABORTION?

40:10.041 --> 40:11.510
THE WEEK YOU WENT
TO THE CONFERENCE

40:11.543 --> 40:14.212
IN SEATTLE.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.715
YOU LEFT ME MONEY.

40:16.748 --> 40:20.085
EVERY DECISION
YOU AND I MADE

40:20.118 --> 40:22.588
WAS BASED ON A LIE.

40:22.621 --> 40:25.657
I WANTED CHILDREN,
REMEMBER?

40:25.691 --> 40:26.658
AND GRANDCHILDREN.

40:26.692 --> 40:28.460
AND I'LL NEVER HAVE THEM.

40:28.494 --> 40:30.729
YOU STOLE THEM
FROM ME, LINNIE.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.566
I'M SORRY.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.668
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

40:36.702 --> 40:40.105
I'M STILL THE WOMAN
YOU MARRIED.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.641
CAN'T YOU FORGIVE ME?

40:42.674 --> 40:46.077
I--I DON'T THINK I CAN.
