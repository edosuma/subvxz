<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:02.756 --> 00:05.235
You are looking through
a window into another world.

00:05.476 --> 00:08.036
An alternate universe, just
like ours, and in

00:08.131 --> 00:10.227
each of them there is
a version of us.

00:10.779 --> 00:12.331
I can't let Peter die again.

00:12.732 --> 00:14.158
Walter, Peter is dead.

00:14.276 --> 00:15.620
I'm talking about
the other Peter.

00:15.818 --> 00:17.220
The one on the other side.

00:17.619 --> 00:19.715
I crossed into another universe

00:19.836 --> 00:21.611
and took a son
that wasn't mine.

00:21.805 --> 00:23.499
23 YEARS LATER

00:23.659 --> 00:26.123
Agent Dunham, I
work for the FBI

00:26.235 --> 00:27.811
in Fringe division dealing with

00:27.908 --> 00:30.491
weird and mysterious events.

00:30.636 --> 00:33.565
Consultants Peter Bishop
and Doctor Walter Bishop.

00:33.939 --> 00:35.122
Hello Doctor Bishop.

00:35.157 --> 00:36.252
Newton. So what
do we know about him?

00:36.303 --> 00:37.553
William bell told me

00:37.621 --> 00:38.955
That Newton would try
to open a doorway

00:39.022 --> 00:41.957
From our universe
to the other side.

00:42.009 --> 00:43.643
I'm not from here, am I?

00:43.710 --> 00:46.479
Son...
I am not your son.

00:46.563 --> 00:48.431
I can take you back
where you belong.

00:48.482 --> 00:49.465
Peter is in danger.

00:49.533 --> 00:51.150
Help us cross over.

00:51.235 --> 00:54.020
Walter, over here he's
the secretary of defense.

00:54.104 --> 00:55.404
The fringe team answers to him.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.440
Invaders from another universe.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.325
They're our doubles,
but they can't be trusted.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.160
You gotta trust me.
I'm you.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.750
What is it?

01:07.817 --> 01:08.834
Something to heal

01:08.919 --> 01:10.269
The problems of this world.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.455
His bringing me back was never
about fixing this universe.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.957
It was about destroying yours.

01:15.025 --> 01:16.025
They're heading back
to the opera house.

01:16.093 --> 01:19.795
<i>Make the switch.</i>

01:19.846 --> 01:22.348
Welcome back.

01:22.432 --> 01:24.133
I know you can hear me!

01:24.184 --> 01:26.102
Please let me out of here!

02:10.013 --> 02:11.314
With that pickax.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.399
Where's your dumb cousin?

02:13.483 --> 02:14.883
He ain't dumb.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.902
And don't worry about him.
Just keep working.

02:32.169 --> 02:34.086
All right.

02:49.386 --> 02:51.086
What do you think's in it?

02:51.138 --> 02:52.254
Ain't our job to think.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.890
It's our job to dig.

02:54.941 --> 02:57.410
We're getting paid
a lot of money for this.

02:57.477 --> 03:01.096
It's got to be
something valuable.

03:01.148 --> 03:02.531
That's exactly
the kind of thinking

03:02.599 --> 03:04.150
that found us trouble in Texas.

03:04.234 --> 03:05.568
Yeah?

03:05.619 --> 03:11.007
We made a lot of money
back in Texas.

03:11.074 --> 03:13.159
Maybe just a peek.

Agent Olivia Dunham,

04:32.322 --> 04:34.556
Joined the fringe division
September 9th, 2008.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.925
And you also got files
on both bishops,

04:36.993 --> 04:38.277
Broyles, bell, and Farnsworth.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.195
Where did you get this?

04:40.246 --> 04:42.898
I've been over here
since you were in High School,

04:42.949 --> 04:45.400
And I've cultivated
a lot of resources.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.786
Anything you need, just ask.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.455
<i>A history of pop culture.</i>

04:49.539 --> 04:51.006
<i>That's your homework.</i>

04:51.073 --> 04:55.828
It'll help familiarize you
with this world.

04:55.895 --> 04:57.579
If you can move your hair
to the side.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.080
Yeah.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.384
Now don't worry.
You won't feel a thing.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.686
.
Who's "bone-o"?

05:04.754 --> 05:06.688
Oh, it's Bono, actually.

05:06.756 --> 05:07.673
He's a musician.

05:07.740 --> 05:08.941
Oh, yeah.
Is he any good?

05:09.025 --> 05:11.810
One of the few I like
on this side.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.312
Well, he's easy on the eyes.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.414
Careful.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.899
Their side may be alluring,

05:16.950 --> 05:19.201
But don't be taken in by it.

05:19.268 --> 05:20.936
They started the war.
Remember?

05:23.590 --> 05:27.659
You don't have to remind me
whose side I'm on.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.877
Did you do
what I told you to do?

05:28.945 --> 05:30.696
I hired a team and sent it
to the site, yes.

05:30.763 --> 05:31.797
Your usual men?

05:31.881 --> 05:33.282
No. I don't want
to burn my resources.

05:37.887 --> 05:40.756
Does that meet
with your approval?

05:40.807 --> 05:42.558
I don't care how long
you've been here.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.842
This is my operation.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.094
You work for me.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.149
Indeed.

05:53.636 --> 05:55.020
"Dr. Bell's company was known

05:55.104 --> 05:57.906
"for tackling the most advanced
technological problems.

05:57.974 --> 05:59.491
"he will long be remembered

05:59.576 --> 06:02.477
As one of our country's
leading visionaries."

06:02.529 --> 06:04.947
It's a bit generic,
don't you think?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.532
<i>He was my best friend.</i>

06:06.616 --> 06:07.916
<i>Wherever he is,</i>

06:07.984 --> 06:09.585
He'll be very disappointed.

06:09.652 --> 06:10.586
We're low on butter.

06:10.653 --> 06:12.421
Butter? Right.

06:12.488 --> 06:13.422
Coming up.

06:13.489 --> 06:14.489
And you think this is what,

06:14.541 --> 06:16.542
Some sort of doomsday machine?

06:16.626 --> 06:19.294
Well, walternate said that it
was a very powerful piece

06:19.345 --> 06:21.380
<i>Of ancient tech.</i>

06:21.464 --> 06:22.664
<i>He spent the last few years</i>

06:22.715 --> 06:24.833
<i>Looking for the machine's
component pieces.</i>

06:24.884 --> 06:25.851
But he's finished
assembling it?

06:25.935 --> 06:27.686
No. He was missing
several of them.

06:27.770 --> 06:31.106
Including one
very important one.

06:31.173 --> 06:32.507
Me.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.526
You think this is accurate?

06:34.611 --> 06:36.612
That you somehow
can power this device?

06:36.679 --> 06:41.283
The device seem to need
a specific human interface,

06:41.350 --> 06:43.452
D this piece
responded directly to me.

06:43.519 --> 06:46.071
If that's true,
if walternate needs you

06:46.155 --> 06:47.155
To operate this weapon...

06:47.207 --> 06:49.024
We know that he has agents
on this side.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.358
If he wanted me back,

06:50.410 --> 06:51.793
I think they would have
made a play already.

06:51.861 --> 06:53.361
<i>There has to be
some other plan.</i>

06:53.413 --> 06:54.696
<i>Peter, these cacao beans,</i>

06:54.747 --> 06:55.914
They're inedible.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.866
Gene will never be able
to digest them.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.501
She's a cow, Walter.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.803
<i>She could probably
digest the frying pan.</i>

07:01.871 --> 07:03.589
<i>What is he doing?
Oh, you don't
want to know.</i>

07:03.673 --> 07:05.874
I'm trying to make
chocolate milk.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.927
Or rather, I'm trying to make
the cow make chocolate milk.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.714
Dr. Bishop, do you have
any idea why this machine

07:12.765 --> 07:14.883
Would or could be
configured for Peter,

07:14.934 --> 07:16.435
Why it would respond to him?

07:16.519 --> 07:18.820
I know that this machine
is dangerous.

07:18.888 --> 07:20.405
Which is why we need
to understand it.

07:20.490 --> 07:21.556
If it is indeed a threat...

07:21.608 --> 07:23.558
Then to ignore it
would be irresponsible.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.994
<i>I've heard
that argument before.</i>

07:26.062 --> 07:28.396
That's what you people
told Oppenheimer

07:28.448 --> 07:29.998
When you discovered
that the Nazis

07:30.066 --> 07:31.199
Were working on a bomb.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.452
And how do you think he slept

07:33.536 --> 07:35.170
After his little invention

07:35.237 --> 07:36.955
Had killed
hundreds of thousands

07:37.040 --> 07:38.707
In a fraction of a second?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.746
I need to go back
to the market.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.748
Aspirin, we need
to go to the market.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.799
Is he okay?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.585
Well, he's Walter.
Define "okay."

07:53.640 --> 07:54.606
Hey.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.975
Do you need anything
at the market?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.227
No, thank you.

08:04.450 --> 08:07.536
Peter, I know you and Walter
have been through a lot,

08:07.603 --> 08:09.871
But if this is the threat
we think it is,

08:09.939 --> 08:13.492
We need Walter focused.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.044
What if he's right?

08:16.112 --> 08:19.047
What if we shouldn't
be working on this thing?

08:23.753 --> 08:24.670
<i>You ready?</i>

08:24.754 --> 08:25.671
Yeah.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.422
<i>Okay.
Let's go.</i>

08:31.177 --> 08:34.196
We've been back for two days,

08:34.263 --> 08:37.465
And Walter's already
driving you to drink?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.183
Do you blame me?

08:39.268 --> 08:40.818
Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck

08:40.886 --> 08:43.238
In one of those bad
buddy cop movies.

08:43.304 --> 08:44.856
Like I'm handcuffed to a...

08:44.941 --> 08:46.742
To a mad scientist
who kidnapped you

08:46.809 --> 08:48.026
From another universe?

08:48.111 --> 08:51.947
Yeah. Exactly.

08:51.998 --> 08:55.367
You know, I understand Walter's
concern about the weapon,

08:55.451 --> 08:56.585
But I think
that broyles is right.

08:56.652 --> 08:58.036
We need to figure out
what it does,

08:58.121 --> 09:00.706
And can't do that
without Walter.

09:11.434 --> 09:13.168
I love this song.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.669
Really?

09:14.721 --> 09:15.937
Don't you?

09:16.005 --> 09:19.524
No, it's a great song.
I just...

09:19.609 --> 09:20.842
As long as I've known you,

09:20.893 --> 09:22.343
I've never heard you express
an interest in music.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.283
I've been noticing
a lot of things

09:28.350 --> 09:31.787
Since we've been back.

09:31.854 --> 09:34.406
I guess being over there and
meeting another Olivia Dunham

09:34.490 --> 09:37.142
Has made me think about
the way I look at the world,

09:37.210 --> 09:41.463
The choices I've made.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.849
Come on.

09:43.933 --> 09:44.850
Are you serious?

09:44.934 --> 09:46.818
Yeah, come on.

09:46.903 --> 09:48.803
What, are you one of those guys
who doesn't like to dance?

09:48.855 --> 09:50.989
No.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.410
I guess there's nothing

09:55.478 --> 09:56.945
Like seeing another version
of yourself

09:56.996 --> 10:00.031
To give you
a little perspective.

10:00.116 --> 10:03.452
I got to tell you,
it was strange...

10:03.503 --> 10:04.953
Being with the other you.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.656
It was like looking into
one of those carnival mirrors.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.625
What, you didn't
like the red hair?

10:10.676 --> 10:13.128
Well, I've always
preferred blondes.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.163
But you did make
a very sexy redhead.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.732
Good.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.652
The more I think
about being over there,

10:20.736 --> 10:25.306
The less real it seems.

10:25.358 --> 10:30.028
But you, you still feel real.

10:38.037 --> 10:39.788
Dunham.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.592
The neighbor found 'em
a few hours ago.

10:43.659 --> 10:47.129
<i>M.E. Puts the time of death
around 10:00 last night.</i>

10:49.515 --> 10:52.350
What are you thinking?

10:52.435 --> 10:54.970
Nothing.
Just taking it in.

10:56.772 --> 10:58.840
Dr. Bishop,
any thoughts?

10:58.891 --> 11:00.842
Reminds me of Monet's
water lilies.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.644
The painting?

11:02.695 --> 11:04.362
It's a pastel.
Look at the blood.

11:04.447 --> 11:06.781
<i>It's a shade lighter
than ordinary.</i>

11:06.849 --> 11:08.700
<i>It's mixed
with something else.</i>

11:08.784 --> 11:11.186
Possibly spinal fluid.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.071
So where are the men
who tied them up?

11:13.156 --> 11:15.991
Neither of them had I.D.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.193
Techs are taking prints.

11:20.213 --> 11:24.716
Seem to be in some type
of vegetative trance

11:24.800 --> 11:26.751
Before they expired.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.386
So you've seen
something like this before?

11:28.471 --> 11:30.538
No.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.892
Nostradamus is said
to have died standing up,

11:33.976 --> 11:36.678
But I highly doubt that someone
who predicted his own death

11:36.729 --> 11:38.847
Wouldn't have laid down.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.265
But you're saying
whatever did this

11:40.349 --> 11:41.433
Didn't kill them right away.

11:41.517 --> 11:42.767
It's a hypothesis,

11:42.852 --> 11:46.104
But we are yet
to find our rosebud,

11:46.189 --> 11:49.291
The elusive clue
that will unlock the mystery.

11:49.358 --> 11:51.293
So has anyone located
what they were after?

11:51.360 --> 11:52.861
We don't even know
what they were after.

11:52.912 --> 11:55.013
Beware of buried treasure, huh?

11:55.081 --> 11:56.081
We're thinking
there was a third thief

11:56.165 --> 11:57.082
Who took whatever they dug up.

11:57.149 --> 11:58.750
<i>Unless, of course,</i>

11:58.818 --> 12:01.203
<i>This buried treasure
had legs of its own.</i>

12:01.254 --> 12:03.505
<i>Wouldn't that
be delightful?</i>

12:05.975 --> 12:07.459
Any leads on the third man?

12:07.527 --> 12:10.579
No, not yet.

12:13.766 --> 12:15.050
I was just in Milton.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.551
We got a problem.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.136
Your little plan
wasn't so foolproof.

12:18.221 --> 12:20.088
The device was supposed
to be there, right?

12:20.139 --> 12:21.256
Well, it wasn't.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.141
One of your men
must have taken it.

12:23.226 --> 12:25.026
Two of your men died
like you planned,

12:25.094 --> 12:27.262
But the other one survived
and took the device.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.647
I only hired two men.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.452
That's them, yeah.

12:34.537 --> 12:35.937
If there were three,
all three should be dead.

12:35.988 --> 12:37.122
No one can withstand
that thing.

12:37.206 --> 12:39.207
Well, someone did,
and we need to find him.

12:58.106 --> 12:59.890
That sound creeps me out.

12:59.974 --> 13:00.974
Really?

13:01.025 --> 13:05.145
I always found it
oddly comforting.

13:05.196 --> 13:07.447
Oh, that's very good, dear.

13:07.515 --> 13:11.618
Have you ever worked
behind a deli counter?

13:11.686 --> 13:13.820
Walter, your tie.

13:13.871 --> 13:15.822
I, uh...

13:16.958 --> 13:19.710
I think you have a
little bit of brain on it.

13:19.794 --> 13:20.994
Here, let me, uh...

13:28.353 --> 13:31.722
It's raspberry jam.

13:31.806 --> 13:33.840
Walter, it's time to go.

13:33.891 --> 13:36.643
Can you give us just a minute?

13:36.711 --> 13:38.845
Maybe I'm overdressed.

13:38.896 --> 13:41.047
Maybe I should change anyway.

13:41.099 --> 13:43.517
Walter, you look fine.

13:43.568 --> 13:46.019
No, I don't think
I can do this.

13:46.070 --> 13:49.656
Walter, it's gonna be okay.

13:49.724 --> 13:52.025
You look lovely.

13:57.498 --> 14:00.000
This place makes me feel
so insignificant.

14:03.171 --> 14:05.539
I read that they
invented a wheelchair

14:05.590 --> 14:09.042
That can be steered
by brainwaves alone.

14:09.093 --> 14:13.463
Some sort of
micro-electro technology.

14:17.585 --> 14:19.753
<i>Walter, Peter,</i>

14:19.804 --> 14:21.921
We're set up in my office.

14:21.973 --> 14:23.440
Nina,

14:23.524 --> 14:28.028
I know that this has been
a great loss to you as well.

14:44.379 --> 14:46.946
<i>"my great friend
Isaac once said,</i>

14:46.998 --> 14:49.082
"life is joy, death is peace.

14:49.150 --> 14:53.286
"it's transition
that's difficult.

14:53.337 --> 14:55.472
"I was not a man
of many friends,

14:55.556 --> 14:57.657
<i>"but if I'd had hundreds,</i>

14:57.725 --> 15:01.645
<i>"I would still cherish
the two of you most.</i>

15:01.713 --> 15:06.016
<i>"Nina,
I was your right hand,</i>

15:06.084 --> 15:07.818
<i>"and you were mine.</i>

15:07.902 --> 15:12.139
<i>"for the many hours we spent
exploring the possible,</i>

15:12.206 --> 15:13.640
<i>"a small thank you.</i>

15:17.445 --> 15:22.749
<i>"and for the precious few
we had alone in Tuscany,</i>

15:22.817 --> 15:24.301
<i>"a memento of me.</i>

15:37.432 --> 15:39.933
<i>"Walter,</i>

15:40.001 --> 15:43.804
"we gather knowledge faster
than we gather wisdom.

15:43.855 --> 15:47.774
"by now I trust you have
ample reserves of both.

15:47.842 --> 15:50.510
<i>I hope you've forgiven me."</i>

16:00.872 --> 16:05.041
<i>Thus concludes the last will
and testament of William bell.</i>

16:05.126 --> 16:07.694
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

16:19.039 --> 16:20.924
So you gonna tell me?

16:21.008 --> 16:22.476
What?

16:22.543 --> 16:26.813
About the letter.

16:26.881 --> 16:28.315
No.

16:28.382 --> 16:29.316
I don't think so.

16:33.104 --> 16:34.404
Hello?

16:34.489 --> 16:35.572
Dunham's not picking up.

16:35.656 --> 16:36.940
You two at Blake's
apartment yet?

16:37.024 --> 16:38.024
No, I'm not with Dunham.

16:38.075 --> 16:39.326
Who's Blak

16:39.393 --> 16:41.227
He's one of the two men
we found in the basement.

16:41.279 --> 16:42.829
We got a fingerprint hit
on him this morning.

16:42.897 --> 16:43.830
<i>She didn't call you?</i>

16:43.898 --> 16:45.982
No, she didn't.

17:06.186 --> 17:07.253
Hey.

17:09.773 --> 17:10.707
Hey.

17:10.775 --> 17:12.258
Broyles called you.

17:12.310 --> 17:14.694
Yeah.

17:14.762 --> 17:17.262
Sorry.

17:17.315 --> 17:19.065
I know you don't
want to babysit,

17:19.116 --> 17:21.818
But I knew Walter
had a big day today,

17:21.903 --> 17:23.869
And if I called, you'd come.

17:31.462 --> 17:33.163
Blake's got a friend
living here.

17:33.247 --> 17:35.065
Looks that way.

17:35.132 --> 17:37.918
Although there's nothing
to tell us who he is.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.803
I was just gonna
go look for the landlord,

17:39.871 --> 17:40.921
See what he knows.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.506
Maybe you could
do another once-over,

17:43.591 --> 17:45.559
In case I missed something?

18:06.247 --> 18:07.831
It's Dunham.
You got a pen?

18:07.915 --> 18:09.115
I do now.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.785
<i>1200 Remington place,
Cambridge.</i>

18:11.836 --> 18:13.670
Bishop and I will be
gone in 30 minutes.

18:13.754 --> 18:15.171
<i>I need you there then.</i>

18:15.256 --> 18:17.090
We got to bring this guy in.

18:35.044 --> 18:38.380
Walter?

18:38.447 --> 18:39.798
<i>How s the reading
of the will?</i>

18:39.883 --> 18:44.002
You know, there's this
South American centipede

18:44.087 --> 18:46.722
That's been known to crawl
through the nasal passages

18:46.789 --> 18:49.474
And wreak this kind of havoc.

18:49.542 --> 18:52.861
Do you think that a bug could
have killed all five victims

18:52.929 --> 18:56.465
And disrupted the electronics
in the house?

18:56.533 --> 18:59.401
Probably not.

19:01.437 --> 19:05.073
Hey. Hey.

19:05.141 --> 19:07.492
Walter.

19:07.577 --> 19:10.946
Is everything okay?

19:10.997 --> 19:13.916
No.

19:20.790 --> 19:22.674
This is from bell?

19:24.844 --> 19:26.995
It's a key
to a safety deposit box.

19:31.868 --> 19:33.368
<i>It's an old argument.</i>

19:33.436 --> 19:35.554
Belly and I spent days

19:35.622 --> 19:38.190
Discussing the wisdom
of crossing the line.

19:38.274 --> 19:42.110
"only those that risk
going too far

19:42.178 --> 19:46.398
Can possibly know how far
they can go."

19:46.482 --> 19:48.433
That's what belly used to say.

19:48.501 --> 19:51.370
So you were the cautious one?

19:51.454 --> 19:53.322
He was over there.

19:53.373 --> 19:59.328
He saw what I did,
all that I destroyed.

19:59.379 --> 20:02.547
How can he tell me
to cross the line?

20:02.632 --> 20:06.201
Walter, you saved Peter's life.

20:06.252 --> 20:08.220
I know that there
were consequences,

20:08.304 --> 20:10.372
But Peter has got to understand

20:10.423 --> 20:13.058
Why you made
the choices you made.

20:13.142 --> 20:14.810
You've talked to him,
haven't you?

20:18.348 --> 20:19.848
I've been waiting
for the right moment.

20:19.899 --> 20:21.883
Walter, you said you were
gonna do that days ago.

20:21.935 --> 20:24.152
He has got to hear
your side of the story.

20:30.610 --> 20:34.613
Endolymph fluid.

20:34.697 --> 20:37.232
There's severe damage
to the inner ear.

20:37.283 --> 20:40.252
Pass me a swab, please.

20:52.081 --> 20:54.416
I think I know
what happened here.

20:54.467 --> 20:55.917
Walter, I can't
find the requiem.

20:55.969 --> 20:57.686
<i>Perhaps don Giovanni.</i>

20:57.753 --> 21:00.105
So you think that music
killed these people?

21:00.189 --> 21:01.756
Not music per Se.

21:01.808 --> 21:03.642
Could you help me with this
please, my dear?

21:03.726 --> 21:06.261
What about this?
Would that work?

21:06.312 --> 21:08.063
<i>Figaro.
Perfect.</i>

21:08.114 --> 21:09.648
We've known for some time

21:09.732 --> 21:13.618
That different sounds affect
the brain in different ways.

21:20.994 --> 21:25.297
♪ look at my brain waves
on the monitor ♪

21:27.467 --> 21:28.616
<i>They're smoothing out.</i>

21:28.668 --> 21:31.503
Harmonic music
reduces neural activity.

21:31.587 --> 21:33.955
Which is why
we think more clearly

21:34.007 --> 21:35.340
When we listen to it.

21:35.425 --> 21:37.259
As opposed to this.

21:38.594 --> 21:43.298
Dissonance.
Look... look at my neurons.

21:43.349 --> 21:46.985
<i>Look at my neurons.</i>

21:47.070 --> 21:48.153
<i>We get it, Walter.</i>

21:48.237 --> 21:49.187
Can I turn this off now?

21:49.272 --> 21:50.772
Oh, sorry.

21:50.823 --> 21:51.940
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

21:51.991 --> 21:53.075
You see, the point is this,

21:53.142 --> 21:56.411
That with this type
of auditory phenomenon,

21:56.479 --> 22:00.032
Taken to its ultrasonic extreme,
can be fatal,

22:00.116 --> 22:01.500
And the way
it affects the brain,

22:01.584 --> 22:03.818
It could well
have induced some type

22:03.870 --> 22:06.171
Of vegetative
trance before death.

22:06.255 --> 22:08.823
Which would also explain
the trauma to the inner ear.

22:08.875 --> 22:11.877
So we're looking for some kind
of deadly music box?

22:11.961 --> 22:13.161
No, it's ultrasonic, so you
wouldn't be able to hear it.

22:13.212 --> 22:14.162
The frequency's too high.

22:14.213 --> 22:17.299
Silent but deadly.

22:17.350 --> 22:19.551
Speaking of which,

22:19.635 --> 22:23.388
Might like to take a step away.

22:23.456 --> 22:26.608
Delightful, Walter.

22:26.675 --> 22:28.894
Any ideas why it didn't
affect the third man?

22:28.978 --> 22:30.479
Maybe headphones of some sort?

22:30.530 --> 22:32.981
They would need to be
very sophisticated.

22:33.032 --> 22:34.616
I'm gonna call broyles.

22:34.683 --> 22:35.717
Have him monitor the city

22:35.785 --> 22:39.221
For any abnormal
ultrasonic activity.

22:39.288 --> 22:41.339
<i>Walter.</i>

22:44.644 --> 22:47.179
Go talk to him.

22:49.265 --> 22:51.066
All the victims were patients

22:51.133 --> 22:52.818
Of Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak.

22:52.902 --> 22:56.071
He ran an outpatient clinic
in Seattle.

22:56.138 --> 22:58.440
<i>Nayak was ostensibly
treating these patients</i>

22:58.491 --> 23:01.877
<i>As part of a clinical trial
for sleep disorders.</i>

23:10.002 --> 23:12.804
You got a photographic memory.

23:12.872 --> 23:15.123
How am I gonna do that?

23:41.284 --> 23:43.518
You don't move
unless I tell you to.

23:43.569 --> 23:46.321
Got it?

23:46.372 --> 23:48.022
Okay.
Step inside.

23:57.133 --> 23:59.718
Put the box down.
On the bench.

23:59.802 --> 24:00.969
Slowly.

24:08.010 --> 24:10.312
Please.

24:10.379 --> 24:11.813
Don't hurt me,
Mrs. Dunham.

24:17.687 --> 24:19.404
You're deaf.

24:23.993 --> 24:28.496
That's why you didn't die.

24:28.564 --> 24:31.533
I'll call Olivia.
Thanks.

24:31.584 --> 24:34.870
Peter, may I have a moment?

24:34.921 --> 24:36.588
Sure.
What's up?

24:36.672 --> 24:39.407
I, uh...

24:39.458 --> 24:42.327
Today when I said
goodbye to belly,

24:42.395 --> 24:44.462
It was hard.

24:44.547 --> 24:45.647
Very hard.

24:45.715 --> 24:47.799
<i>Sure, it was.</i>

24:47.884 --> 24:50.185
Um, I'm sorry if I wasn't...

24:50.252 --> 24:52.854
No, not that.

24:52.922 --> 24:58.443
What I'm trying to say
is that it was nothing,

24:58.477 --> 25:02.647
Nothing compared to saying
good-bye to my son.

25:02.732 --> 25:06.067
Walter, I got to call Olivia.

25:06.118 --> 25:08.403
Peter, you need to hear this.

25:12.208 --> 25:15.794
When Peter...

25:15.878 --> 25:19.998
My Peter...

25:20.082 --> 25:22.117
Died...

25:22.184 --> 25:24.069
I lost all hope.

25:24.136 --> 25:27.756
The only thing that kept
me alive was Elizabeth,

25:27.807 --> 25:31.176
And my window into your world.

25:31.244 --> 25:33.895
I always told belly
that we couldn't cross over,

25:33.963 --> 25:36.932
That it was far too dangerous.

25:40.269 --> 25:42.187
When I saw that you
were dying too,

25:42.271 --> 25:45.974
And that I was the only one
who could save you...

25:46.025 --> 25:49.961
You kidnapped me, Walter.

25:50.029 --> 25:52.981
You took me from my family.

25:53.032 --> 25:56.051
From my world.

25:56.118 --> 25:58.470
I didn't plan to.

25:58.537 --> 26:01.122
That was not my intention.

26:05.494 --> 26:07.912
I love you, Peter.

26:07.980 --> 26:11.099
And if I had to make
the choice all over again,

26:11.167 --> 26:12.968
I'm not sure that
I'd be strong enough

26:13.019 --> 26:13.969
To act differently,

26:14.020 --> 26:19.774
But now I understand
that it was wrong,

26:19.842 --> 26:23.678
That I should never
have crossed the line,

26:23.729 --> 26:26.865
That it was terribly wrong.

26:28.985 --> 26:31.036
I can't talk
about this yet, Walter.

26:36.942 --> 26:39.911
He saw my badge outside
of Blake's apartment.

26:39.996 --> 26:41.195
He thought he was
bringing the box

26:41.247 --> 26:42.580
Back to the authorities.

26:42.665 --> 26:46.184
I'll come back after
I'm done to help you with him.

26:46.252 --> 26:50.889
It's too bad he's not blind.

26:50.973 --> 26:53.875
If you need me
to take care of him...

26:53.926 --> 26:56.277
No, you can just do your job.

26:56.345 --> 26:58.396
Make sure you don't
screw it up this time.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.550
I'm sorry.

27:55.771 --> 27:57.205
Peter.

27:57.272 --> 27:58.206
<i>Hey.</i>

27:58.273 --> 27:59.874
<i>Did I come at a bad time?</i>

28:07.130 --> 28:08.914
<i>Hey, you want me
to come back later?</i>

28:08.982 --> 28:10.048
No, not at all.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.050
I, uh, I just got out
of the shower,

28:12.102 --> 28:14.353
So can you just
give me a minute?

28:14.404 --> 28:15.354
I'm sorry.

28:15.405 --> 28:17.440
I should have called
before I came over.

28:29.836 --> 28:30.753
Hey.

28:30.837 --> 28:33.038
Hey.
Mind if I come in?

28:33.089 --> 28:35.090
Sure.

28:37.961 --> 28:40.429
<i>So...
Walter apologized to me.</i>

28:40.514 --> 28:45.134
I know it wouldn't take much.

28:45.218 --> 28:46.635
<i>A few words, a hug,</i>

28:46.720 --> 28:48.471
A couple hands of uno.

28:48.555 --> 28:52.257
Anything would make the man feel
better at this point, but...

28:52.309 --> 28:56.595
I just can't bring
myself to do it.

28:56.646 --> 28:59.031
Sometimes I can't even
look the guy in the eye.

28:59.098 --> 29:00.933
Well, you two
have been through a lot.

29:00.984 --> 29:02.151
You can't expect
just to go back

29:02.235 --> 29:03.736
To the way it was
before overnight.

29:03.787 --> 29:08.357
We all know this has been
hard on you, Peter.

29:08.425 --> 29:10.776
No, you have no idea.

29:10.827 --> 29:13.395
<i>I saw what Walter did.</i>

29:13.463 --> 29:17.550
I saw the quarantine zones.

29:17.617 --> 29:19.919
I saw all the damage
that he caused.

29:19.970 --> 29:24.707
He destroyed their world.
My world.

29:24.774 --> 29:28.928
Well, he couldn't have known
how bad it was gonna be.

29:28.979 --> 29:31.129
Yeah.

29:31.181 --> 29:33.131
I mean, it's not like they
gave him a picture of himself

29:33.183 --> 29:34.567
With fireballs
coming out of his eyes

29:34.634 --> 29:38.187
While he was strapped into
a doomsday machine.

29:38.271 --> 29:41.574
You didn't come here to talk
about Walter, did you?

29:45.579 --> 29:50.115
I can't close my eyes
without seeing that picture.

29:50.183 --> 29:51.917
And whatever
is in those blueprints

29:51.985 --> 29:56.088
Is my connection
to that machine.

29:56.155 --> 29:58.507
What if they're right?

29:58.592 --> 30:00.092
What if that machine

30:00.159 --> 30:02.962
Does exactly what broyles
and Walter think it does?

30:03.013 --> 30:06.181
Is that my destiny, my fate?

30:06.266 --> 30:08.050
Am I supposed
to destroy worlds too?

30:08.134 --> 30:09.334
Because,
I'll be honest with you,

30:09.386 --> 30:11.687
I don't really want
to turn out like Walter.

30:17.627 --> 30:19.845
Peter, the truth is
I'm scared too.

30:23.233 --> 30:27.653
The last few weeks have been
hard on all of us.

30:27.704 --> 30:32.408
You know, of course there's
always the temporary fix.

30:32.492 --> 30:33.742
The temporary fix?

30:35.829 --> 30:37.129
Distraction.

30:57.317 --> 30:58.233
Hello.

30:58.318 --> 31:00.519
Hi.

31:02.822 --> 31:04.823
What's this?

31:04.891 --> 31:08.827
It's, uh...
It's a box.

31:08.895 --> 31:12.264
Well, what's in it?

31:12.332 --> 31:14.016
As with most things in life,

31:14.084 --> 31:16.068
The reality would
pale in comparison

31:16.119 --> 31:17.369
With one's imagination.

31:17.420 --> 31:20.923
And, uh, isn't it better
to wonder?

31:26.930 --> 31:29.548
I say, uh, would you mind
keeping an eye on the box

31:29.599 --> 31:30.532
While I go to the restroom?

31:30.600 --> 31:33.902
Is there, you know,
remuneration?

31:33.970 --> 31:35.688
Of course.

31:38.975 --> 31:40.943
There you go.

31:41.027 --> 31:42.111
I won't be a minute.

31:42.195 --> 31:44.813
<i>Okay.</i>

32:15.995 --> 32:17.496
Astrid.
Broyles.

32:17.563 --> 32:19.748
Well,
that can't be a good sign.

32:26.423 --> 32:27.790
Kent street.

32:27.874 --> 32:30.592
I frequented a massage parlor

32:30.677 --> 32:31.794
Just around the corner.

32:31.878 --> 32:33.212
I used to get off right here.

32:33.263 --> 32:35.547
I sure hope you're talking
about the station, Walter.

32:37.050 --> 32:37.966
<i>We got five more victims,</i>

32:38.051 --> 32:39.885
Maybe more unaccounted for.

32:39.936 --> 32:41.253
All mobile, but unresponsive.

32:41.304 --> 32:42.805
They're in some kind of trance.

32:42.889 --> 32:45.858
<i>Lieutenant, I want every subway
station in Boston evacuated.</i>

32:49.762 --> 32:51.763
<i>Security cameras
picked up a small man</i>

32:51.815 --> 32:55.484
<i>Walking into the tunnel
carrying a metallic box.</i>

32:55.568 --> 32:57.436
These people
seem to be suffering

32:57.487 --> 33:00.489
From the same symptoms
as the victims at Milton.

33:00.573 --> 33:02.040
Yes, we're thinking the box

33:02.108 --> 33:03.959
<i>Might be what the thieves
dug up there.</i>

33:04.043 --> 33:05.327
What about the trains?

33:05.412 --> 33:06.829
System runs on a computer.

33:06.913 --> 33:08.464
We've logged in
and stopped all trains

33:08.548 --> 33:10.716
Going into the tunnel.

33:10.783 --> 33:12.251
Bomb squad's ready to deploy
a man in the tunnel.

33:12.302 --> 33:13.919
Bomb squad?
This thing's not a bomb.

33:13.970 --> 33:15.838
You send your men in there,
they're gonna get killed.

33:15.922 --> 33:17.423
That tunnel leads straight
to another station.

33:17.474 --> 33:19.141
If this box is mobile,
we have to stop it.

33:19.225 --> 33:20.459
You have a better idea?

33:20.510 --> 33:21.810
Yeah, I'll go.

33:21.895 --> 33:24.813
<i>Peter, you can't.
It's too dangerous.</i>

33:24.898 --> 33:26.315
The box is our
responsibility, Walter.

33:26.399 --> 33:27.483
And if I can
get in front of it,

33:27.567 --> 33:28.484
Maybe I can disarm it.

33:28.568 --> 33:29.651
No, no, no.

33:29.736 --> 33:31.687
I haven't had time
to devise something

33:31.771 --> 33:33.071
To protect you
from the sound emissions.

33:33.139 --> 33:35.023
I'm sure your boys have some
sort of ear protection, right?

33:35.108 --> 33:36.808
The frequencies are ultrasonic.

33:36.860 --> 33:38.660
Simple noise cancellation
won't work.

33:38.745 --> 33:40.913
<i>I'd have to disable
all impulses</i>

33:40.980 --> 33:42.414
<i>Along the cochlear nerve.</i>

33:42.482 --> 33:44.166
My men are standing by, agents.

33:44.250 --> 33:47.586
Peter, I have to make
a call here.

33:47.653 --> 33:49.204
What is it, Walter?

33:49.289 --> 33:51.673
The science is tenuous
to say the least.

33:51.758 --> 33:53.542
Walter, if you have a way
to put me in front of that box,

33:53.626 --> 33:55.177
You got to tell me right now.

33:55.261 --> 33:57.662
Walter, talk to me.

34:02.001 --> 34:03.469
<i>Agent Dunham,</i>

34:03.520 --> 34:06.638
We're going to need your gun.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.143
<i>Mic test.
One, two.</i>

34:12.195 --> 34:13.277
So how long have I got?

34:13.346 --> 34:15.898
I don't know.

34:15.982 --> 34:18.900
If you can hear us talking,
it's too late.

34:18.985 --> 34:22.371
Well, ballpark it
for me, Walter.

34:22.455 --> 34:25.958
Maximum, three minutes.

34:26.025 --> 34:27.359
You ready?

34:34.083 --> 34:37.252
Do it.

35:37.313 --> 35:39.948
<i>I see it.</i>

35:56.699 --> 35:58.417
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

36:19.805 --> 36:21.573
<i>I know what this is.</i>

36:21.641 --> 36:23.141
<i>It's a piece of the weapon.</i>

36:23.192 --> 36:25.611
<i>I recognize from
Walternate's blueprints.</i>

36:25.662 --> 36:26.778
The weapon from the other side?

36:26.829 --> 36:29.114
<i>How's that possible?</i>

36:40.429 --> 36:42.079
<i>Looks like the box
was soundproof.</i>

36:42.147 --> 36:44.282
<i>But it's broken.
I can't close it.</i>

36:44.349 --> 36:45.967
<i>I'm gonna try to disarm it.</i>

37:12.944 --> 37:15.196
He hasn't spoken
for 71 seconds.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.614
Something is wrong.

37:16.665 --> 37:20.751
His hearing could come back
at any time.

37:20.819 --> 37:22.086
<i>We need to send someone in.</i>

37:22.153 --> 37:24.154
<i>I can't send another man
in there.</i>

37:24.206 --> 37:25.423
<i>He could be hurt.
He could be Dy...</i>

37:25.490 --> 37:28.926
Hey, guys.
Do you hear that?

37:28.993 --> 37:31.012
I thought all the trains
were stopped.

37:31.096 --> 37:33.264
The device affected the
subway's communication system.

37:33.331 --> 37:35.165
<i>Dunham, wait!
You can't go in there!</i>

38:22.046 --> 38:24.432
<i>For a catastrophic
explosion like that,</i>

38:24.516 --> 38:26.767
<i>I imagine he had some sort
of surgical implant.</i>

38:26.852 --> 38:29.770
Dental ceramic crowns.

38:29.855 --> 38:30.905
If they were to vibrate

38:30.989 --> 38:33.390
At just the right
resonant frequency...

38:33.442 --> 38:34.608
I always hated dentists.

38:34.693 --> 38:36.277
And you're sure this
is part of the weapon?

38:36.361 --> 38:39.730
Yeah, looks just like the parts
I saw on the other side.

38:39.781 --> 38:41.916
And we know that walternate
has agents over here.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.751
Maybe they're looking
for the missing pieces,

38:43.835 --> 38:45.202
The ones he couldn't find
over there.

38:50.292 --> 38:53.544
Why would there be pieces
on our side?

38:53.595 --> 38:55.963
You got a better explanation?

38:56.047 --> 38:58.766
We're talking about
two universes here.

38:58.834 --> 39:01.936
Two of each one of us.

39:02.020 --> 39:04.855
At this point, would
anything really surprise you?

39:04.923 --> 39:07.057
<i>Bacon-flavored pudding.</i>

39:07.109 --> 39:10.044
That would surprise me.

39:13.598 --> 39:15.900
I'd like to take this
back to the lab.

39:15.951 --> 39:17.451
We got the blueprints.

39:17.536 --> 39:18.786
Maybe I can figure it out.

39:18.854 --> 39:21.071
Okay.

39:33.218 --> 39:34.969
<i>I guess you've got
other plans for tonight.</i>

39:35.053 --> 39:37.304
Yeah.
Do you mind?

39:37.372 --> 39:39.673
'course not.

39:45.564 --> 39:47.014
Today was a bad day.

39:47.098 --> 39:49.350
But it could have been
a lot worse.

39:49.417 --> 39:52.753
<i>Your quick thinking saved
a lot of lives, Dr. Bishop.</i>

39:55.006 --> 39:56.774
Good work.

41:25.363 --> 41:27.748
Walter.

41:27.832 --> 41:29.700
Hi.

41:31.570 --> 41:33.637
I know what belly left me.

41:41.496 --> 41:43.297
He left me Massive Dynamic.

41:51.806 --> 41:54.308
I'm the sole shareholder.

42:46.014 --> 42:49.524
Peter HAS FIRST PIECE

42:52.985 --> 42:55.447
HE IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED

43:01.968 --> 43:05.704
UNDERSTOOD. BEGIN WORK
