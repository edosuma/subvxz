00:20.564 --> 00:22.770
Hmm.

00:22.387 --> 00:24.209
Mm-hmm.

00:25.839 --> 00:30.538
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:29.579 --> 00:31.977
A-ha.

00:33.607 --> 00:35.813
Wowsers, it's quiet.

00:36.772 --> 00:38.786
Too quiet.

00:38.403 --> 00:42.335
And when it's this quiet...

00:41.567 --> 00:43.773
You know what that means, Brain?

00:46.842 --> 00:49.336
Evil's afoot.   

00:52.692 --> 00:55.665
We're on a stakeout, GADGET-MOBILE!

00:54.994 --> 00:58.063
No, you're on a stakeout. I'm on a sleep-in.

00:57.487 --> 00:59.310
So keep it down, alright?

00:58.926 --> 01:01.515
The least you could do is stay alert.

01:01.036 --> 01:03.721
Alert for what? Face it. Inspector G...

01:03.146 --> 01:05.831
since we locked up Claw, all the bad guys have been...

01:05.352 --> 01:08.037
too afraid to show their faces in Riverton.

01:07.461 --> 01:10.626
One thing I've learned in all my years...

01:09.955 --> 01:12.832
of crime fighting, GADGET-MOBILE...

01:12.257 --> 01:15.326
is that it's always the most quiet...

01:14.750 --> 01:20.025
right before the criminal strike!

01:18.970 --> 01:21.751
And speaking of crime...

01:25.204 --> 01:28.464
Potential law-breaker at 12 o'clock!

01:27.793 --> 01:29.711
Who? Grandma over there?

01:38.247 --> 01:41.699
Oops! There go those glitches again.

01:46.398 --> 01:53.016
Ah.. The speed limit is clearly posted
at 25 miles per hour...

01:51.769 --> 01:58.866
But, she's going at exactly 25.3 miles per hour.

01:57.427 --> 02:01.743
Prepare for high-speed chase!

02:06.347 --> 02:10.662
Hang onto your pockets,
'cause here come the rockets.

02:30.898 --> 02:32.720
Oh, my!

02:33.391 --> 02:35.118
Stop in the name of the ....

02:38.570 --> 02:39.625
Law.

02:39.433 --> 02:40.872
That went well.

02:48.640 --> 02:52.956
GADGET-MOBILE : Whoa. Now.
How is that for disc brakes?

02:52.093 --> 02:55.353
, Back in the thing!

02:54.682 --> 02:56.313
Oh...

02:56.025 --> 02:58.710
Ahem.

03:08.013 --> 03:11.849
Ma'am, do you know that drag racing...

03:11.082 --> 03:13.383
on public roads is illegal?

03:12.904 --> 03:14.534
But, officer, I ...

03:14.247 --> 03:17.028
GADGET: There are no buts
when it comes to the law.

03:16.452 --> 03:20.097
I'm afraid I'm gonna need
to see your driver's license.

03:19.329 --> 03:23.549
I'm sorry, Officer.
I must've left it at home.

03:22.686 --> 03:24.316
Yeah, A likely story.

03:26.522 --> 03:31.222
Aah! You have the right to remain ... silent!

03:30.263 --> 03:32.756
If you give up ... Coming through ...

03:32.277 --> 03:35.729
that's right ... Unh! 

03:34.962 --> 03:37.839
My man really needs to switch to decaf.

04:08.145 --> 04:10.926
GADGET-MOBILE : OK. One sweet granny...

04:10.350 --> 04:12.556
packaged and ready for delivery.

04:12.077 --> 04:14.666
Drag racing indeed.

04:14.187 --> 04:16.584
I've seen your type before.

04:16.105 --> 04:18.598
You've got a need for speed.

04:18.119 --> 04:19.845
Yeah..I know.

04:19.461 --> 04:21.571
Uncle Gadget!
Hi, Brain!

04:22.338 --> 04:26.558
Penny,I thought we agreed
you'd call me "Inspector"...

04:25.695 --> 04:28.668
in front of the hardened criminals.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.723
She's a hardened criminal?

04:29.339 --> 04:32.312
Don't be fooled by appearances, Penny.

04:31.737 --> 04:34.135
Look what I found in her purse.

04:33.655 --> 04:36.053
Probably from one of her victims.

04:35.573 --> 04:38.163
And look at this.

04:37.683 --> 04:40.368
Liquid evil.

04:39.793 --> 04:41.903
But, but, officer ...

04:41.519 --> 04:43.725
Save it for the judge, perp.

04:43.245 --> 04:46.218
Yeah, but, but, but.

04:45.643 --> 04:48.808
Everybody's got a big but.

04:48.137 --> 04:53.891
Hey! What are you doing here?
Isn't today a school day?

04:52.740 --> 04:57.152
Well, there aren't any good
cases to solve at school.

04:56.288 --> 04:58.494
I want to solve real cases with you.

04:58.111 --> 04:59.741
Penny, I told you before...

04:59.357 --> 05:01.084
you're too young to be chasing criminals.

05:00.796 --> 05:02.330
You should be in school.

05:01.947 --> 05:04.248
But, uncle Gadget, if you'd just
give me a chance, I ...

05:03.865 --> 05:05.495
Look, I have to go.

05:05.112 --> 05:07.126
I'm in the middle of a big arrest.

05:06.742 --> 05:08.468
Now you get back to school...

05:08.085 --> 05:10.194
and I'll see you tonight.

05:09.811 --> 05:13.647
And you, I hope you like prison food.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.606
Mm, mm, mm.

05:14.222 --> 05:17.771
BAXTER : Now. Let's see how
your physiobiometric...

05:17.100 --> 05:19.881
febble fitzer is functioning.

05:21.223 --> 05:25.635
Oh ... Diagnostics check out fine.

05:24.772 --> 05:27.649
What seems to be the problem, Gadget?

05:27.074 --> 05:29.855
Baxter. I'm still having gadgets
with my glitches.

05:29.279 --> 05:32.828
I mean ... glitches with my glitches

05:32.156 --> 05:34.266
I'm all messed up.

05:34.075 --> 05:40.596
Sorry, Gadget, I don't see
what the problem is.

05:39.253 --> 05:41.171
Watch.

05:48.748 --> 05:51.625
GADGET : See? Bubble Gum...

05:52.392 --> 05:56.228
I see what the problem is.

05:55.461 --> 05:58.626
Isn't there something you can
do for me, Baxter?

05:57.955 --> 06:03.517
Ah ... you're the prototype gadget, Gadget.

06:02.462 --> 06:06.011
There's bound to be a few glitches.

06:05.243 --> 06:10.230
But you'll be happy to know
we've been working on it.

06:09.271 --> 06:13.395
I'll let you in on a little secret.

06:12.532 --> 06:17.711
Soon, we'll be on therein something ...

06:18.574 --> 06:24.328
Soon...that'll solve all base
glitches for good ... soon.

06:23.177 --> 06:27.781
Wowsers. Thanks, Baxter.

06:26.822 --> 06:31.329
Well, better go check in with the chief.

06:30.466 --> 06:33.727
Ooh ... I wouldn't bother
the chief right now.

06:33.055 --> 06:37.179
I heard some idiot arrested
his mother this afternoon.

06:36.316 --> 06:40.248
CHIEF : Where is he?

06:39.481 --> 06:40.824
Gadget!

06:40.536 --> 06:42.262
BAXTER : Oh ...

06:41.975 --> 06:46.482
You put my mother in jail
for drag racing?

06:45.523 --> 06:48.112
And driving without a license.

06:47.633 --> 06:51.277
You've always said, Chief,
no one is above the law.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.771
This is what you also said
last week when you arrested...

06:53.195 --> 06:56.936
that troop of Girl Rangers
for selling cookies!

06:57.895 --> 07:03.841
Those cookies were three days
past expiration date!

07:04.416 --> 07:07.293
CHIEF : Ugh ... What ... Ugh.

07:08.828 --> 07:13.239
You are this close to being
put on probation, Gadget.

07:12.376 --> 07:14.774
Now, let's get my mother out.

07:14.294 --> 07:19.089
Heaven knows what's happening to her down
there with all those low lifes.

07:18.130 --> 07:21.679
And then, when his guard is down,
his kidneys are exposed...

07:20.912 --> 07:25.803
and that's when the marathon of pain begins.

07:24.844 --> 07:28.968
-Oh! 
-Who's your grandma now?

07:28.104 --> 07:31.749
Take some of this! How'd you like this?

07:31.077 --> 07:33.667
GADGET : Wowsers, that's gotta hurt.

07:34.818 --> 07:36.448
Unh!

07:36.064 --> 07:39.421
Mom's tough love.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.298
This is your last warning, Gadget.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.079
Stick to solving real crimes.

07:44.408 --> 07:48.532
Chief, there are no real criminals yet
in the Riverton Prison.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.919
[Ring Ring]

08:11.165 --> 08:13.275
Gadget here.

08:14.810 --> 08:17.783
What?

08:17.111 --> 08:20.180
Ah ... Ha ...

08:19.605 --> 08:21.139
Wowsers!

08:22.098 --> 08:26.318
You'll never guess what happened.

08:25.551 --> 08:27.469
Claw escaped!

08:27.085 --> 08:29.099
Claw escaped?

08:28.620 --> 08:31.017
Police have put out an all-points bulletin ...

08:30.538 --> 08:32.360
and are setting up a dragnet ...

08:32.072 --> 08:34.374
in hopes of finding the fugitive.

08:33.895 --> 08:36.388
Citizens are advised that if they see ...

08:35.909 --> 08:39.553
an evil genius with a claw not to approach him.

08:38.785 --> 08:41.855
Dial 911 immediately.

08:41.279 --> 08:46.074
He's extremely dangerous and really, really mean.

08:45.115 --> 08:49.143
And I'm on the case. Bye-bye, Penny!

08:48.280 --> 08:50.678
PENNY : Wait, Uncle Gadget!

08:50.198 --> 08:54.993
You've got let me come with you. I mean ...
I can help look for clues--

08:54.034 --> 08:56.720
I told you before, Penny, you're too young.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.597
How old do you have to be to be a detective?

08:58.926 --> 09:01.323
I don't know.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.433
But older than you are now.

09:02.858 --> 09:04.392
Look...

09:04.104 --> 09:06.981
I've got work to do. I'll see you tomorrow.

09:06.406 --> 09:08.420
Don't forget to brush your teeth.

09:10.818 --> 09:15.709
I could do so well ...
if he would just give me a chance.

09:16.188 --> 09:19.928
My finely honed instincts are telling me...

09:19.161 --> 09:22.422
that he probably escaped through here.

09:21.751 --> 09:23.765
Oh, really?

09:23.381 --> 09:25.683
Gadget, take a look at this.

09:25.203 --> 09:27.984
We found this in Claw's cell.

09:27.409 --> 09:32.492
Wowsers. You don't think he's still
holding a grudge, do you?

09:31.533 --> 09:33.163
Gadget, listen.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.657
The whole city is counting on you.

09:35.081 --> 09:38.150
Go out there and catch Claw.

09:37.575 --> 09:39.205
Oh, I'll catch him.

09:38.822 --> 09:40.835
Caught him before, catch him again.

09:40.452 --> 09:42.274
Don't worry, Chief.

09:41.890 --> 09:46.206
I'll have Claw back behind bars
before you can say ...

09:45.343 --> 09:50.522
CHIEF : Gadget ..... Ooh!

09:56.947 --> 10:00.688
CLAW : Brick, retrieve my darts!

09:59.920 --> 10:01.838
Huh? Ooh!

10:01.455 --> 10:04.428
McKible, serve my tea!

10:05.291 --> 10:06.921
McKIBLE : I don't see why we gotta...

10:06.538 --> 10:10.182
retrieve your darts and serve your tea.

10:09.511 --> 10:11.045
Yeah!

10:10.662 --> 10:14.306
We're vicious minions, not vallet. 

10:13.635 --> 10:16.512
Ah ..... ! OooOH!

10:15.936 --> 10:21.307
Heh Heh Heh. One sugar or two?

10:20.252 --> 10:22.362
Two.

10:21.882 --> 10:23.321
Here, boss.

10:24.376 --> 10:29.075
BRICK : Dr. Claw, This place is a dumb!
What happened to your multimillion-dollar...

10:28.116 --> 10:29.938
high-rise evil headquarters?

10:29.555 --> 10:32.240
What do you think happened to it?

10:31.761 --> 10:33.199
Aah!

10:34.542 --> 10:37.227
CLAW : When Gadget arrested me ...

10:36.748 --> 10:40.584
the police confiscated all my assets.

10:39.816 --> 10:44.420
But after we've pulled off
the crime of the century ...

10:43.461 --> 10:47.009
I'll be back on top again.

10:46.338 --> 10:51.709
Great ... another crime of the century.

10:50.558 --> 10:53.243
I'm still on parole for the last one.

10:52.764 --> 10:54.778
What's the plan this time?

10:54.298 --> 10:55.928
Watch and see.

10:55.641 --> 10:57.463
NEWS ANCHOR : The Federal Reserve Bank ...

10:57.079 --> 10:59.860
with a deposit of over five trillion dollars ...

10:59.285 --> 11:03.121
in pure gold was built two years ago ...

11:02.354 --> 11:05.039
after Riverton was declared statistically ...

11:04.560 --> 11:08.204
the safest city in America.

11:07.437 --> 11:10.602
Utilizing the latest in security technology ...

11:10.026 --> 11:12.807
and a squadron of armed guards ...

11:12.232 --> 11:16.452
the bank is considered impregnable.

11:15.589 --> 11:17.986
 <br>CLAW : Not
CLAW : Not for long.

11:17.507 --> 11:19.713
BRICK : We're gonna rob the Federal Reserve!

11:19.233 --> 11:21.918
CLAW : Right before Riverton's eyes ...

11:21.439 --> 11:25.563
and there won't be a thing
Inspector Gadget can do about it.

11:24.700 --> 11:30.166
How we can do that? They said the bank was impen--

11:31.125 --> 11:33.427
Really hard to get into.

11:32.947 --> 11:35.345
Yeah, I don't see how.

11:34.865 --> 11:39.373
That's why you're just minions,
and I'm an evil genius.

11:38.414 --> 11:39.948
He's got a point.
Yeah.

11:39.661 --> 11:45.511
We are going to build the ultimate super weapon.

11:44.360 --> 11:46.949
But we haven't much time.

11:46.470 --> 11:49.251
We need to be ready in 10 days ...

11:48.676 --> 11:53.758
because next Thursday at exactly 9:23 A.M.

11:52.704 --> 11:57.595
the X-Force One satellite will be
directly over Riverton.

11:56.636 --> 11:59.800
And by then, We need to steal ...

11:59.129 --> 12:03.924
ion fuel cells.
A protoid laser ...

12:02.965 --> 12:06.034
and a ruby...

12:05.459 --> 12:09.199
plus a few miscellaneous knick knacks.

12:08.432 --> 12:13.515
BRICK : Yum. I love knick knacks.

12:16.679 --> 12:19.557
Any news on Claw's escape?

12:18.981 --> 12:20.612
The city's in a panic!

12:20.228 --> 12:21.858
The people want to know.

12:21.571 --> 12:23.201
What are you doing to capture Claw?

12:22.913 --> 12:27.708
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a momentous day for us.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.202
OFFICER : Huh?

12:29.818 --> 12:32.791
MAYOR : The Gadget program has helped make Riverton ...

12:32.216 --> 12:34.422
OFFICER : Thanks a lot. Hmph!

12:34.038 --> 12:36.532
... the safest city in America!

12:38.162 --> 12:40.080
Bob!

12:39.696 --> 12:43.341
Thank you, Mayor.

12:42.574 --> 12:46.218
We weren't going to unveil this until next year ...

12:45.547 --> 12:48.616
but in light of Claw's escape ...

12:47.944 --> 12:50.821
we decided to move up our timetable.

12:51.780 --> 12:54.466
CHIEF : Baxter..

12:53.986 --> 12:59.357
This is Gadget Model 2 ...

12:58.206 --> 13:01.850
or "G2" for short.

13:01.179 --> 13:05.687
The latest, most newest generation ...

13:04.727 --> 13:08.755
in the Gadget program.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.046
G2 reporting for duty.

13:29.471 --> 13:31.293
Sir!

13:33.115 --> 13:35.033
Wowsers.

13:34.650 --> 13:39.732
BAXTER : She's similar to the original Gadget...

13:38.773 --> 13:48.172
But she's completely, entirely all robot.

13:51.529 --> 13:54.406
Not to worry, G2...

13:53.830 --> 13:56.707
I've got everything under control.

13:56.132 --> 13:59.585
Oh, Inspector, you're everything ...

13:58.817 --> 14:01.598
I ever wanted in a crime fighter.

14:03.229 --> 14:04.763
Mmm.

14:10.422 --> 14:13.682
CHIEF : Gadget! Gadget!

14:15.025 --> 14:18.190
Gadget, could you give me a hand, please?

14:17.614 --> 14:19.149
Certainly, Chief.

14:18.765 --> 14:23.656
I want to give a little demonstration
of what G2 can do.

14:22.697 --> 14:26.150
Pleasure to meet you, Miss ... 2.

14:28.548 --> 14:30.562
G2 : Hmm.

14:30.178 --> 14:33.822
Must be a loose wire something else.

14:33.055 --> 14:36.699
I'll speak to Baxter ... about that.

14:35.932 --> 14:41.878
G2 will now show us how
she would apprehend the suspect.

14:40.727 --> 14:47.249
Gadget, I want you to take this stolen money ...

14:45.906 --> 14:49.934
and hide it on your person.

14:49.167 --> 14:53.099
Stolen money!

14:55.497 --> 14:57.990
Stop this felonious and unlawful act ...

14:57.415 --> 15:00.292
or I shall have to use force.

14:59.716 --> 15:04.224
Well, she has got a very commanding voice.

15:07.389 --> 15:10.745
COMPUTER VOICE : Alert! Suspect! Suspect!

15:10.074 --> 15:13.527
Very well. You were warned.

15:18.130 --> 15:21.678
Whoa! ... Whoa!

15:21.007 --> 15:23.692
Oh!

15:23.117 --> 15:26.761
Unh! Huh.

15:26.090 --> 15:28.775
You have the right to remain silent.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.981
If you give up this right, anything you say ...

15:30.406 --> 15:32.515
can and will be held against you.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.105
All right, G2, I think we get the picture.

15:34.530 --> 15:38.557
MAYOR : Bravo! Bravo!

15:37.694 --> 15:39.421
Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen ... 

15:39.133 --> 15:42.010
GADGET : Well ... she is very good.

15:43.928 --> 15:49.203
That's one of the many improvements
I've made to G2.0.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.929
Like it?

15:50.354 --> 15:56.204
You might say that G2 is you without the glitches.

15:55.053 --> 15:58.026
I'm putting her on the Claw case right away.

15:57.451 --> 16:01.670
Fantastic! I always wanted a partner.

16:00.807 --> 16:03.205
And when we interrogate criminals ...

16:02.725 --> 16:06.466
I'll play good Gadget, and you can play bad Gadget.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.425
I don't think so.

16:07.137 --> 16:10.685
OK, then you play good Gadget, and I'll be bad Gadget.

16:09.918 --> 16:12.603
I appreciate the ofference, Inspector ...

16:12.124 --> 16:14.426
but I work ... alone.

16:13.946 --> 16:17.974
But, chief had cloaked my case.

16:17.207 --> 16:16.727
You can go back to cracking
speeders on the highway, Gadget.

16:20.563 --> 16:24.687
There's a new sheriff in town.

16:23.824 --> 16:27.181
Hmm?

16:26.509 --> 16:32.456
PENNY : Uncle Gadget? Uncle Gadget!
Is this true they're giving the Claw

16:31.305 --> 16:34.565
Well ... for the time being,
but don't worry, Penny...

16:33.894 --> 16:37.922
I'm being reassigned to another high-profile case.

16:37.155 --> 16:39.936
What could be more high-profile than Claw?

16:39.361 --> 16:40.991
Oh ... it's a top secret, Penny.

16:40.607 --> 16:45.882
That's so top secret that they
haven't even told me yet, huh?

16:44.827 --> 16:46.841
PENNY : Hmm.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.471
So, what are you making there?

16:48.088 --> 16:51.349
I'm just making your favorite dessert.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.650
Apple crumb cake with raisin cinnamon icing...

16:53.075 --> 16:55.089
and coconut sprinkles?

16:54.705 --> 16:57.966
OK, I'm making your second favorite dessert...

16:57.295 --> 17:00.268
Lemon pudding.

16:59.692 --> 17:06.310
So, ah ... since from case we guess,
you wouldn't want to see this clue

17:04.967 --> 17:07.269
Clue claw? I mean ... a Claw clue?

17:06.789 --> 17:08.898
Is it a clue about Claw?

17:08.515 --> 17:11.105
Take a look at today's classifieds.

17:11.968 --> 17:13.406
"Wanted"...

17:17.914 --> 17:20.023
"Apply 7 P.M. tonight."

17:19.640 --> 17:23.571
"Call 555-0139 for appointment."

17:22.805 --> 17:27.217
I've already got a job, Penny, but thanks.

17:26.258 --> 17:28.079
No, I checked the number...

17:27.791 --> 17:30.190
and it's for a bar called "The Blue Monkey."

17:29.710 --> 17:31.437
You know what this means right?

17:31.053 --> 17:32.683
Hmm.

17:32.395 --> 17:34.985
Uncle Gadget, if you go to The Blue Monkey...

17:34.410 --> 17:36.903
I bet it will lead you right to Claw.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.492
You can get back on the case and get a jump on G2.

17:38.917 --> 17:42.274
You know, Penny, if I went to The Blue Monkey...

17:41.602 --> 17:43.712
it might just lead me to Claw.

17:43.233 --> 17:46.781
Then, I could get back on the case
and get the jump on G2.

17:46.110 --> 17:47.932
That's what I was just saying.

17:47.548 --> 17:52.056
Oh ... did you? I guess great minds think alike.

17:51.097 --> 17:52.248
So, we'll make it right afternoon, right?

17:52.056 --> 17:56.084
No. Nope. I'm sorry, Penny...

17:55.317 --> 17:58.385
but this is official police business only.

17:57.714 --> 18:01.263
You gotta let me come with you. I mean I can help you.

18:00.591 --> 18:03.756
Penny, this is no place for a kid.

18:03.085 --> 18:07.209
I'm not just a kid, Uncle Gadget!

18:08.360 --> 18:12.292
Of course not. You're a very special kid.

18:11.428 --> 18:16.128
But there's more to being a detective
than just being smart.

18:15.265 --> 18:17.662
It takes a sharp eye...

18:17.183 --> 18:19.676
for every detail, every little nuance.

18:19.101 --> 18:21.978
A good detective never lets anything get ...

18:21.402 --> 18:23.129
Uncle Gadget, the pudding!

18:26.869 --> 18:29.554
OK! Heh Heh Heh.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.952
Everything's fine!

18:38.282 --> 18:40.871
Ugh.

18:40.296 --> 18:43.940
It's a good thing I wore an apron.

18:44.419 --> 18:45.954
GADGET-MOBILE : OK. Here we are.

18:45.570 --> 18:48.351
GADGET : Wish me luck. I'm going under cover..

18:56.599 --> 18:59.189
Hi, there, fellas.

18:58.613 --> 19:00.339
Unh.

19:00.052 --> 19:02.353
PENNY : OK. Brain. the coast is clear.

19:07.724 --> 19:10.026
Come on, that's from deck.

19:17.027 --> 19:18.657
What do you want?

19:18.273 --> 19:20.767
Well, I just got out of the slammer.

19:20.288 --> 19:23.261
and I'm looking to wet my whistle.

19:22.685 --> 19:24.220
What'll you have?

19:23.932 --> 19:25.562
A nice tall glass of milk.

19:25.179 --> 19:26.809
milk?

19:26.521 --> 19:31.221
I mean, chocolate milk!

19:30.261 --> 19:33.810
Make it a double.

19:33.139 --> 19:36.975
PENNY : Hey. Brain. This way.

19:39.276 --> 19:41.674
McKIBLE : OK. then.

19:41.195 --> 19:47.428
Let's see what applicants we have here.

19:46.182 --> 19:52.991
Squint. Jungle Bob.

19:51.648 --> 19:56.156
And you must be the one they call "The Ninja".

19:55.292 --> 19:58.937
BRICK : "Ninja"? Why do they call you that?

19:58.170 --> 20:01.526
Hyah!

20:02.293 --> 20:04.595
I think I see why now.

20:05.266 --> 20:07.472
OK, then.

20:06.993 --> 20:13.514
Judging by this, you guys
are prime minion material.

20:22.913 --> 20:25.598
Hoo!

20:31.928 --> 20:37.490
I have a history of hair loss in my family.

20:36.435 --> 20:39.025
Anything else I can get you?

20:38.449 --> 20:40.847
Yes.

20:40.367 --> 20:42.669
I'm looking for ...

20:44.491 --> 20:49.574
Sorry, we don't serve lobster here.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.204
What? No.

20:50.629 --> 20:53.986
Dr. Claw.

20:53.314 --> 20:55.136
Claw, huh?

20:56.287 --> 20:58.589
Well, if you want to find him...

20:58.110 --> 21:01.562
you're gonna have to grease a few palms...

21:00.891 --> 21:03.001
If you get my drift.

21:02.521 --> 21:06.453
Well, whatever you say.

21:05.686 --> 21:08.275
Here you go..

21:07.796 --> 21:10.002
top grade axle grease.

21:11.248 --> 21:13.550
Why, you...

21:14.605 --> 21:16.044
Aah!

21:15.756 --> 21:18.058
Whoa!

21:27.744 --> 21:29.470
Check, please.

21:30.621 --> 21:32.539
Just the check.

21:35.608 --> 21:38.581
So...

21:38.006 --> 21:40.979
When do we start working for Dr.Claw?

21:40.403 --> 21:42.417
McKIBLE : Immediately.

21:41.938 --> 21:43.760
Did you hear that, Brain?

21:47.021 --> 21:53.254
GADGET : Aah! Come on, guys!
Let's talk about it.

21:52.008 --> 21:55.172
Oh, man. Aah!

21:54.597 --> 21:56.803
You're stretching my sweater.

21:56.323 --> 21:59.392
Help, GADGET-MOBILE!

21:58.817 --> 22:02.269
Help! Ooh!

22:05.722 --> 22:08.695
The cops! Come on, this way!

22:08.119 --> 22:11.572
Let's get out of here quick!
Move it! Move it! Move it!

22:13.011 --> 22:16.367
BRICK : We can hide at my mom's house.

22:15.696 --> 22:18.381
PENNY : That was close.

22:20.012 --> 22:22.217
GADGET : Ooh, I can see you're upset.

22:21.834 --> 22:26.533
BARTENDER : Hey, look, I'm knocking his block off!

22:25.574 --> 22:28.163
Mom ...

22:27.588 --> 22:30.849
Coo-coo. Coo-coo.

22:30.273 --> 22:31.808
Coo-coo.

22:34.877 --> 22:37.274
Stop this felonious and unlawful act...

22:36.795 --> 22:39.096
or I shall have to use force.

22:38.617 --> 22:44.467
Look, boys, Malibu Barbie here is
gonna get rough with us.

22:45.714 --> 22:50.125
G2 : Very well. You were warned.

22:54.057 --> 22:57.894
Wowsers, she's good.

23:03.456 --> 23:05.854
GADGET-MOBILE : Man ... lucky for them.
I wasn't in there.

23:05.374 --> 23:09.594
'cause, I would have been on them
like ugly on a mini-van.

23:08.731 --> 23:11.704
GADGET : Well ... thanks for the backup, G2...

23:11.128 --> 23:13.910
although everything was under control.

23:13.334 --> 23:16.883
I had those toughs right where I wanted them.

23:16.211 --> 23:20.911
Inspector, what were you doing in
that bar dressed as...

23:19.952 --> 23:24.843
What exactly are you supposed
to be dressed as?

23:23.884 --> 23:26.281
I'm a hooligan. Huh?

23:25.802 --> 23:29.542
When I'm under cover to follow up
on a valuable lead...

23:28.775 --> 23:31.652
concerning Where's claw abouts ...

23:31.077 --> 23:34.145
I mean, Claw's where abouts.

23:33.570 --> 23:37.694
I'm in charge of the Crime Investigation
now, remember?

23:36.831 --> 23:42.681
GADGET : Look, G2, maybe we've just thought of
got off on the wrong foot. Ooh!

23:41.530 --> 23:43.352
Oh.

23:43.736 --> 23:46.517
Perhaps we could have dinner sometime ... 

23:45.942 --> 23:49.010
You know? just to discuss crime fighting strategies.

23:48.435 --> 23:51.312
Imagine how great we could be as a team.

23:50.737 --> 23:52.942
We could call ourselves "The G-Force"...

23:52.463 --> 23:54.957
or "The G-Team" or "The 2 Gs".

23:54.477 --> 23:56.779
Inspector Gadget! 
Gadget : What's up, G?

23:56.299 --> 23:59.848
Even though I'm not programmed for such emotions...

23:59.176 --> 24:03.876
I admit I find you strangely ... likable.

24:02.917 --> 24:04.451
Hmm. 
Gadget 2 : But,

24:04.163 --> 24:07.904
as I already told you, I work alone.

24:07.136 --> 24:09.150
And so do l.

24:08.767 --> 24:14.137
I'm just saying that maybe
we could work alone together.

24:13.082 --> 24:15.576
PENNY : You don't even know who I am.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.919
Think about it.

24:16.535 --> 24:19.124
No, really. You can't arrest me.

24:18.645 --> 24:21.138
I'm one of the good guys. Really, I am.

24:20.659 --> 24:23.056
Hold on. She's with me.

24:22.577 --> 24:25.838
Penny! What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you to stay home?

24:25.166 --> 24:27.756
Oh! Never mind that.
Look what I found about Claw.

24:27.276 --> 24:31.208
McKIBLE : Dr. Claw's pulling a little
heist tomorrow night...

24:30.345 --> 24:34.085
at the Concentrated Industries Warehouse.

24:33.414 --> 24:37.634
Wowsers! We'll have to have a stakeout.
Gadget 2 : You mean, I'll have to have a stakeout.

24:36.771 --> 24:39.744
Penny : Hey! This is our case, lady.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.470
Penny.

24:41.086 --> 24:43.868
I know. You told me to stay out of it...

24:43.292 --> 24:45.786
but Look I did find you this clue.

24:45.306 --> 24:48.663
Look! Penny, I know you want to be a detective.

24:47.991 --> 24:51.252
OK. But this following me around all the time...

24:50.581 --> 24:54.033
just isn't going to fly.

24:53.362 --> 24:55.760
Oh!

24:55.280 --> 24:56.719
Uh...

24:56.431 --> 24:59.116
Gadget!

24:58.637 --> 25:00.843
Hi, Chief.

25:01.226 --> 25:07.172
Gadget ... what are you doing
in a barroom brawl?

25:05.926 --> 25:07.940
Looking for Clue claws.

25:07.556 --> 25:10.049
Claw clues .. clue about Claw.

25:09.570 --> 25:12.351
And I was right. We got a valuable lead.

25:11.776 --> 25:13.790
Yeah, a very valuable lead.

25:13.406 --> 25:18.873
We have evidence of a possible heist 
at Concentrated Industries Warehouse

25:17.818 --> 25:19.160
Great work, G2!

25:18.873 --> 25:21.750
You can stake it out and catch him red-handed.

25:21.174 --> 25:24.147
GADGET : Fantastic. I'll bring the doughnuts.

25:23.572 --> 25:27.024
I already told you. You're off this case.

25:26.257 --> 25:29.230
Both you and Nancy Drew here.

25:28.655 --> 25:31.916
Hey! Pbbt!

25:31.244 --> 25:36.902
And you're off the force, too, if you get
within as a hundred yards of that stakeout.

25:35.848 --> 25:41.410
Alrigt fine, but if Claw gets away with his
plan for world domination. Don't come and cry on us.

25:40.259 --> 25:40.259
Remember, Gadget ... 100 yards!

25:43.232 --> 25:47.260
GADGET : 99, 100 ...

25:46.493 --> 25:51.000
101 yards away.

25:50.041 --> 25:53.302
I'm at the stakeout...

25:52.727 --> 25:55.987
but I haven't violated the chief's orders.

25:55.316 --> 25:57.522
See? At the stakeout...

25:57.042 --> 25:58.960
not at the stakeout.

25:58.577 --> 26:00.974
Stakeout ... not at the stakeout.

26:00.495 --> 26:03.180
I don't think the chief will see it that way.

26:10.085 --> 26:15.168
My! she certainly is well-equipped, isn't she?

26:14.209 --> 26:18.141
GADGET-MOBILE : Ooh, Gadget's got a girl friend.
Ooh, Gadget's got a girl friend.

26:17.278 --> 26:19.676
Don't be silly, GADGET-MOBILE.

26:19.196 --> 26:22.265
Our relationship is strictly professional.

26:25.334 --> 26:28.882
Besides, she's state of the art.

26:28.211 --> 26:29.937
I'm last year's model.

26:29.554 --> 26:32.335
A few extra miles look good on a player....

26:31.856 --> 26:33.869
and you are a player, G.

26:33.390 --> 26:37.322
You're tricked out with more
extras than the Batmobile.

26:36.555 --> 26:40.199
Just show her that it's all good
under the hood, alright?

26:39.528 --> 26:41.542
I have no idea what you just said...

26:41.062 --> 26:43.556
but I'm sure that if I were a car...

26:43.076 --> 26:44.994
it would have been very helpful.

26:44.611 --> 26:46.817
All I'm saying is, you got to show her...

26:46.433 --> 26:48.447
you got what it takes, man.

26:47.967 --> 26:51.228
You're right. You're right!

26:52.187 --> 26:54.681
Thanks, GADGET-MOBILE.

26:54.105 --> 27:00.531
Well ... I'm just gonna go up to the roof
and scope out the situation.

26:59.284 --> 27:03.600
GADGET-MOBILE : You go ahead on
with your bad self--Ha!

27:02.737 --> 27:06.381
I don't know what that
man would do without me.

27:05.614 --> 27:08.395
GUARD : Hold on, there.

27:11.560 --> 27:13.765
What do you want?

27:13.286 --> 27:14.916
We got a delivery.

27:14.629 --> 27:19.616
This ain't no food warehouse.
I'm gonna need some authorization.

27:21.630 --> 27:23.548
Will that do?

27:34.385 --> 27:38.221
We're in, Your Clawfulness.

27:37.454 --> 27:41.290
CLAW : Good. Now bring me the 
ion fuel cells.

27:40.523 --> 27:42.537
Yes, sir.

27:43.592 --> 27:45.126
Halt!

27:44.838 --> 27:49.730
SQUINT : Oh! It's the mechanical meter maid!

27:48.770 --> 27:50.593
I'm real scared!

27:50.209 --> 27:53.278
Ha Ha Ha! Good one, Squint.

27:52.703 --> 27:56.826
Uh-oh. Looks like G2 could use some backup.

27:55.963 --> 27:58.169
Stop this felonious and unlawful act...

27:57.786 --> 27:59.895
or I shall have to use force.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.909
No problem, Love. Catch!

28:02.772 --> 28:04.211
Huh?

28:08.239 --> 28:11.883
Ooh ... Aah!

28:11.116 --> 28:13.130
Ooh! She got the kung fu.

28:12.746 --> 28:14.760
Aah!

28:14.377 --> 28:18.117
Oh ... Aah!

28:17.350 --> 28:21.857
I'm gonna give them a little bit
of the what for, that's right!

28:28.571 --> 28:30.681
Stupid glitches!

28:30.297 --> 28:33.654
JUNGLE BOB : Come on! Come on, you! Rrr!

28:32.982 --> 28:37.202
 Aah-ha-ha!

28:36.339 --> 28:40.942
Whoa! Ohh.

28:39.983 --> 28:42.765
Hyah!

28:42.189 --> 28:44.395
Whoa!

28:44.011 --> 28:46.888
Aah!

28:48.711 --> 28:51.396
Wowsers, she sure is limber.

28:50.916 --> 28:53.602
Huh? Huh?

28:53.026 --> 28:56.383
What is that? I don't know.

28:55.712 --> 28:57.246
Oh, I don't like this.

28:58.685 --> 29:01.753
Oh, no!

29:10.289 --> 29:13.070
McKIBLE : Hurry it up. bonehead!

29:21.893 --> 29:26.209
Wowsers. I never knew I had one of these.

29:25.346 --> 29:27.839
G2 : Stop this felonious and unlawful act...

29:27.360 --> 29:29.853
or I shall have to use force.

29:29.374 --> 29:32.251
Oh ... Aah!

29:31.676 --> 29:34.649
You imbecile!

29:33.977 --> 29:36.087
COMPUTER VOICE : Suspect. Suspect.

29:42.609 --> 29:45.006
G2 : Very well. You were warned.

29:44.527 --> 29:48.651
Gadget to the rescue!

29:47.787 --> 29:50.281
Ooh ... Unh!

29:53.062 --> 29:59.392
No! No!

30:00.351 --> 30:02.365
What are you doing here?

30:01.981 --> 30:06.009
Well, it looked like ... 
Claw's Dominions : Quick, Grab the fuel cells!

30:05.146 --> 30:07.160
Let's get out of here! Come on!

30:06.776 --> 30:08.599
G2 : They're getting away.

30:08.215 --> 30:11.284
Not to worry, G2. I'll get us out of this.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.367
CHIEF : Gadget!

30:15.983 --> 30:20.970
I told you specifically not to go to the stakeout.

30:20.011 --> 30:22.696
That's not entirely accurate, Chief.

30:22.121 --> 30:26.533
You told me not to get within
100 yards of the stakeout...

30:25.669 --> 30:33.725
and I posted myself exactly 101 yards away.

30:32.095 --> 30:35.452
Then how did you managed to get tangled up
with me inside the warehouse?

30:34.780 --> 30:39.384
You gave me backup at the bar I thought
I'd give you backup at the warehouse.

30:38.425 --> 30:39.384
I never need backup.

30:39.192 --> 30:42.261
Until we find out what Claw needs the fuel cells for...

30:41.685 --> 30:44.179
all of Riverton is at risk.

30:43.699 --> 30:45.426
Chief, you have to put me back on the case.

30:45.042 --> 30:46.768
The department needs me!

30:53.482 --> 30:55.879
That's right, Gadget.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.414
The department does need you.

30:57.030 --> 31:01.058
And I've got just the assignment...

31:00.291 --> 31:03.743
to take advantage of your unique abilities.

31:22.445 --> 31:24.555
Come on, come on.

31:24.075 --> 31:26.089
I'm stuck.

31:28.391 --> 31:30.405
Aah!

31:31.651 --> 31:36.638
 <br> <u>Go, Go,

31:35.583 --> 31:37.406
Stop!

31:37.022 --> 31:41.817
Aah!

31:43.544 --> 31:47.572
Ah ... ah ... oh ... oh ... oh ... ow.

31:46.804 --> 31:49.394
Be careful in there.

31:48.914 --> 31:52.942
That toilet's got quite a flush.

31:53.901 --> 31:58.696
Looks like Gadget has finally
found his true calling ...

31:57.737 --> 32:02.149
Roto-rooter man. Ha ha ha!

32:01.190 --> 32:03.587
Hey, Dr. Claw, check this out ...

32:03.108 --> 32:05.889
an unlimited supply of bowling shirts.

32:05.410 --> 32:07.903
And shoes!

32:11.260 --> 32:13.178
CLAW : Silence!

32:12.794 --> 32:14.808
Everyone, pay attention!

32:14.425 --> 32:17.494
Who can tell me what we need next...

32:16.918 --> 32:19.699
to build my super weapon?

32:19.124 --> 32:21.521
Uh...

32:21.042 --> 32:23.248
CLAW : The laser.!

32:22.768 --> 32:27.180
A new experimental protoid laser....

32:26.317 --> 32:31.016
that's being unveiled at
the Riverton Science Convention.

32:30.057 --> 32:36.674
But to take it, we are going
to need a little divulsion.

32:38.496 --> 32:40.223
Hey, Uncle Gadget.

32:39.935 --> 32:42.620
Penny? shouldn't you be in school?

32:42.045 --> 32:45.018
Uncle Gadget, school was over an hour ago.

32:44.443 --> 32:48.375
Oh. I'm sorry, Penny.

32:47.607 --> 32:49.621
Oh. hey!

32:49.142 --> 32:51.156
This came for you in the mail today.

32:50.772 --> 32:53.362
Looks kind of strange.

32:52.882 --> 32:55.280
"Inspector Gadget..."

33:00.075 --> 33:03.623
Wowsers! He must have really bad hand-writing...

33:02.952 --> 33:04.774
to go to all that trouble.

33:04.391 --> 33:06.788
Or maybe he doesn't want you
to identify his hand-writing.

33:06.309 --> 33:09.569
And, look, it's signed "Anonymous Concerned Citizen."

33:08.898 --> 33:14.077
Well, it's good to know we still have
a concerned citizen who's willing to get involved.

33:13.022 --> 33:15.611
This is supposed to Claw.

33:17.242 --> 33:21.653
No. Why would Claw want me there?

33:20.790 --> 33:22.516
I don't know.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.818
Uncle Gadget, this might be a trap.

33:24.338 --> 33:30.860
You know Penny, I'm thinking that
this might be a trap.

33:29.517 --> 33:32.107
That's what I just said.

33:31.627 --> 33:33.737
You gotta let me come with you this time.

33:33.258 --> 33:36.614
Sorry, Penny. No can do.

33:35.943 --> 33:41.505
This is work for a serious
law enforcement professional.

33:40.450 --> 33:42.848
You mean like a bathroom attendant?

33:42.369 --> 33:44.287
Exactly.

33:43.903 --> 33:47.451
Don't stay up for me, Penny.

33:46.684 --> 33:49.561
I'm on the case.

33:57.042 --> 34:00.782
No. I need you to keep a sharp eye out, GADGET-MOBILE.

34:00.111 --> 34:03.467
If you see anything suspicious, you let me know.

34:02.796 --> 34:05.002
GADGET-MOBILE : Like a Trekkie with a girlfriend?

34:04.522 --> 34:06.728
GADGET : Exactly.

34:06.249 --> 34:10.563
CLAW : The goose has arrived ready to be cooked.

34:12.770 --> 34:15.935
MAN : Here we go. How's that?

34:15.360 --> 34:17.373
Yeah. now. I'll just ...

34:16.989 --> 34:20.634
Even at this level? Wow!

34:23.128 --> 34:26.292
Round and round.

34:25.717 --> 34:29.553
RADIO : In sports. the National Hockey League ...

34:28.786 --> 34:32.717
GADGET : Hmm...

34:31.951 --> 34:35.500
Keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious, Brain.

34:34.732 --> 34:36.266
Come on.

34:35.978 --> 34:39.911
BAXTER : Inspector. Gadget!

34:39.143 --> 34:44.034
Hey, Baxter! What are you doing here?

34:43.076 --> 34:45.665
I'm showing off my latest gizmo ...

34:45.090 --> 34:47.487
the bark translator.

34:47.007 --> 34:49.693
It's going to give a whole new meaning ...

34:49.214 --> 34:51.706
to the term "police dog."

34:51.132 --> 34:52.858
Watch.

34:52.570 --> 34:54.583
Speak, Pedro.

34:57.845 --> 35:01.585
Very impressive. Now Pedro can talk to cows.

35:00.818 --> 35:05.997
No, No, No, No. It's supposed
to translate into English...

35:04.942 --> 35:07.435
once I've got all the bugs out.

35:10.504 --> 35:13.957
MAN : Attention. the unveiling of
the new protoid laser ...

35:13.286 --> 35:15.587
is about to begin.

35:15.108 --> 35:17.505
I'll see you around, Baxter.

35:17.026 --> 35:19.999
Bye Bye, Pedro. Good luck!

35:19.423 --> 35:21.150
Pedro.

35:25.177 --> 35:30.452
Well, better have myself a little look around.

35:35.152 --> 35:39.180
Inspector Gadget!
Inspector Gadget!

35:38.412 --> 35:42.153
Inspector Gadget!

35:41.385 --> 35:46.852
Excuse me, Inspector. I'm your biggest fan.

35:45.797 --> 35:48.003
BRICK : I thought I was his biggest fan.

35:47.523 --> 35:49.345
No. I'm definitely his biggest fan.

35:48.962 --> 35:50.976
No. I'm his biggest fan.

35:50.592 --> 35:53.374
Will you excuse me for one minute?

35:54.620 --> 35:55.771
Sorry.

35:55.483 --> 35:57.881
Would you mind if we took a picture?

35:57.401 --> 36:02.580
Oh, No, No. I'm always happy to oblige my fans.

36:01.621 --> 36:04.498
Ready?

36:03.923 --> 36:07.567
Say cheese.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.239
Cheese. Cheese.

36:07.951 --> 36:11.499
Heh Heh Heh. Thank you, Inspector.

36:10.828 --> 36:14.376
You'll never know how much that means to me.

36:13.609 --> 36:16.103
Well, it's my pleasure.

36:15.623 --> 36:19.843
And remember, crime doesn't pay.

36:18.980 --> 36:20.994
CLAW : Wrong, Gadget.

36:20.610 --> 36:25.214
Crime always pays. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

36:24.254 --> 36:27.323
Thank you, thank you.

36:26.748 --> 36:28.858
Distinguished guests...

36:28.474 --> 36:30.776
and, of course, all members.

36:30.296 --> 36:33.941
It is my great pleasure to welcome you...

36:33.174 --> 36:36.722
to my ..whoops.. our science convention.

36:36.051 --> 36:41.421
The chip is in position, Your Clawfulness, Yeah!

36:40.366 --> 36:43.819
Watch as I play with my new toy...

36:43.052 --> 36:45.641
the Gadget puppet.

36:45.162 --> 36:49.573
Guess that letter must've been a prank.

36:48.710 --> 36:53.313
Everything seems OK.

36:52.354 --> 36:54.848
Oh.

37:06.836 --> 37:09.425
I've never had glitches like that before.

37:08.946 --> 37:11.631
MAYOR : And to introduce you to the eminent...

37:11.056 --> 37:17.577
Nobel-prize winning scientist,
Dr. Theodore Von Sprokenwich.

37:16.330 --> 37:18.249
Thank you very much.

37:17.865 --> 37:19.783
Thank you. thank you.

37:19.399 --> 37:23.044
It's so nice to be here in Riverton.

37:22.276 --> 37:25.345
Ah ... ah ... ah.

37:32.250 --> 37:36.374
...his new experimental protoid laser.

37:38.676 --> 37:44.622
Think positive, no-glitch...

37:43.471 --> 37:45.102
thoughts.

37:44.814 --> 37:48.554
All right, Gadget, let's party!

37:47.787 --> 37:49.609
Ha ha.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.404
Whoa ... whoa ... whoa.

37:55.939 --> 37:59.391
I'm sorry! Should come out with a little soda water.

37:58.624 --> 38:01.885
Inspector Gadget, what do you think you're doing?

38:01.309 --> 38:06.009
 anything.

38:05.050 --> 38:08.406
Huh ... unh ... oh.

38:07.735 --> 38:10.132
Oh, no, Uncle Gadget, what now?

38:09.653 --> 38:13.585
Oh ... Whoa ... Whoa!

38:12.818 --> 38:14.544
What's wrong, Inspector?

38:14.161 --> 38:16.366
I think I'm having a glitch attack.

38:15.887 --> 38:17.613
Ha Ha Ha!

38:17.325 --> 38:19.243
Hyah!

38:18.860 --> 38:21.066
Sorry!

38:20.586 --> 38:24.422
Unh! Hyah! Excuse me.

38:23.655 --> 38:26.916
Whoa ... Mickey.

38:26.244 --> 38:30.560
Woof! Woof! "Woof"?

38:29.697 --> 38:31.711
Let's go!

38:31.327 --> 38:34.972
GADGET-MOBILE, help!

38:39.863 --> 38:40.726
I was right!

38:40.534 --> 38:43.699
Claw's men are stealing the laser!

38:46.096 --> 38:49.741
Don't let them get away. Hurry!

38:53.002 --> 38:55.879
We got away with it.

38:55.975 --> 38:58.660
BRICK : You know what ... this thing's heavy.

38:58.084 --> 39:00.866
[Growling]

39:00.290 --> 39:04.318
Hey! Aah! These are my favorite shoes!

39:03.551 --> 39:06.428
Get in the car!

39:09.401 --> 39:11.990
Gadget, I said stop it this instant!

39:11.415 --> 39:14.484
I've got everything under control.

39:16.114 --> 39:17.553
Ooh!

39:19.471 --> 39:21.773
Oh!

39:21.389 --> 39:23.787
GADGET : Relax! Mayor, Wilson!

39:23.307 --> 39:25.801
It's only toothpaste.

39:25.225 --> 39:25.225
Remember, kids. Brushing is twice a day ...

39:25.225 --> 39:29.062
Aah!

39:30.500 --> 39:33.473
Aah ... Aah!

39:34.720 --> 39:36.830
...Aah! ...Aah!

39:36.350 --> 39:39.036
Whoa!

39:38.556 --> 39:40.187
Ooh.

39:39.803 --> 39:41.625
Easy.

39:41.337 --> 39:42.776
Ew.

39:42.488 --> 39:45.845
Not to worry. I'm all right.

39:45.173 --> 39:46.804
You!

39:47.859 --> 39:51.119
Oof! He's got my shoe!

39:50.544 --> 39:52.558
Bad doggy! Let's go.

40:00.135 --> 40:04.258
First ion fuel cells and now a protoid laser?

40:03.491 --> 40:05.505
What is Claw up to?

40:05.122 --> 40:07.327
GADGET-MOBILE : Huh? What'd I miss this time?

40:06.848 --> 40:08.862
PENNY : Thanks for all your help.

40:08.478 --> 40:10.492
GADGET-MOBILE : Hey! I've been working nights, OK?

40:10.108 --> 40:13.177
I need to recharge my battery.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.822
Brain? What you got there, boy?

40:16.246 --> 40:18.740
From the bad guys?

40:19.315 --> 40:22.480
Hey, now this might be an important clue.

40:24.302 --> 40:27.563
I hope Uncle Gadget's not in too much trouble.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.385
Fired? You can't fire me.

40:28.906 --> 40:33.125
I quit! 
Hmm...

40:32.262 --> 40:34.756
Wait a second. I don't want to quit.

40:34.276 --> 40:39.647
Besides, Chief, It's not my fault.
Look what Baxter found on me ...

40:38.496 --> 40:42.140
a circuit override chip.

40:41.469 --> 40:44.538
I don't care! Claw stole the laser ...

40:43.867 --> 40:47.511
and you tarred and feathered the mayor in toothpaste...

40:46.840 --> 40:50.388
and caused $100,000 in damages.

40:49.621 --> 40:52.786
Turn in your badge, Gadget.

40:52.210 --> 40:54.991
Oh, but, Chief...

40:54.416 --> 40:58.636
all I ever wanted to be my entire life...

40:57.773 --> 40:59.595
was a crime fighter.

40:59.211 --> 41:01.513
Your badge.

41:13.597 --> 41:20.598
Well, that'll be all ... Mr. Gadget.

41:45.245 --> 41:48.122
CLAW : Gadget's goose is cooked ...

41:47.547 --> 41:51.575
more like deep-fried and burnt to a crisp.

41:50.808 --> 41:55.986
Ha Ha Ha ... !

41:54.932 --> 41:57.041
Silence!

41:56.658 --> 41:59.727
Now, with Gadget out of the way...

41:59.055 --> 42:02.796
it should be smooth sailing from here on.

42:02.028 --> 42:06.056
Ha Ha Ha!

42:05.289 --> 42:10.564
GADGET : Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

42:09.509 --> 42:12.290
Hmm.

42:17.469 --> 42:19.962
Uncle Gadget?

42:19.483 --> 42:21.880
What are you still doing in bed?

42:21.401 --> 42:26.580
And, why is your trench coat and hat in the trash can?

42:25.525 --> 42:27.827
I'm no longer a policeman, Penny.

42:28.594 --> 42:32.046
I'm a ... Well ...

42:31.375 --> 42:33.868
There are a lot of things that I could be.

42:33.389 --> 42:36.074
Window washer, huh?

42:35.499 --> 42:39.623
Dog catcher ... Ooh, parking valet.

42:38.856 --> 42:41.541
Sky's the limit.

42:40.966 --> 42:43.747
But, Uncle Gadget, you can't give up now.

42:43.171 --> 42:45.569
Here! look what we've got.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.926
It's a bowling shoe.

42:48.446 --> 42:51.611
One of Claw's men dropped it
at the Science Convention.

42:51.035 --> 42:53.816
What were you doing at the Science Convention?

42:53.241 --> 42:56.502
Never mind that. Look! We can solve this together.

42:55.831 --> 42:58.420
We can track down Claw and get you your job back.

42:57.940 --> 43:01.777
No. I'm through.

43:01.009 --> 43:04.174
All right then, I'll track down Claw myself.

43:03.503 --> 43:10.216
No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No ...

43:08.873 --> 43:12.902
You are to stay out of this completely.
Do you understand?

43:12.134 --> 43:15.011
This is a grown-up problem.

43:14.436 --> 43:18.560
Uncle Gadget, just give me a chance.

43:17.697 --> 43:21.533
One chance.

43:20.766 --> 43:28.438
But, the fact is that there is nothing
that you or anyone else can do for me.

43:27.287 --> 43:30.931
I'll never be a crime fighter.

43:30.260 --> 43:32.370
Never again.

43:31.890 --> 43:35.151
PENNY : You don't believe in me.

43:47.523 --> 43:51.071
Go away, Brain!

43:50.304 --> 43:52.702
Brain, go away!

44:04.018 --> 44:07.950
OK, OK, I get the message.

44:13.321 --> 44:15.814
It's up to us now, Brain.

44:15.335 --> 44:17.541
We have to help Uncle Gadget.

44:18.404 --> 44:21.377
Come on, let's get to work.

44:35.475 --> 44:38.256
That's lunch, people.

44:51.970 --> 44:56.574
All finished! Voila.

44:57.437 --> 45:00.410
WOMAN : Aah!

45:05.013 --> 45:07.315
What's this?

45:06.835 --> 45:09.712
A patent number.

45:09.137 --> 45:11.631
Aha.

45:11.151 --> 45:15.850
CLAW : Faster ... minions ... faster ...

45:14.891 --> 45:17.001
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

45:20.933 --> 45:24.482
G2, are you any closer to capturing Claw?

45:23.715 --> 45:26.304
Yes. I'm on the case.

45:25.824 --> 45:27.647
Hmm.

45:27.263 --> 45:29.757
 Oh, No.

45:32.442 --> 45:34.072
Keep your paws crossed. Brain.

45:33.688 --> 45:35.894
This might be exactly what we're looking for.

45:38.771 --> 45:41.648
Look. It's the same shoe.

45:41.073 --> 45:43.375
The shoe was made by the Bowl-Rite Company...

45:42.895 --> 45:45.964
in the 1950s and 1960s.

45:45.389 --> 45:48.458
I wonder where their factory was.

45:47.882 --> 45:51.814
Let's see ... 1959 ... Bingo!

45:56.897 --> 45:59.966
Ah, here it is. The Bowl-Rite
Bowling Equipment Company ... 

45:59.391 --> 46:01.117
down on Old Mill Road.

46:00.734 --> 46:07.159
It must've gone out of business, because it's not
in any of the directories after 1960.

46:05.912 --> 46:08.406
I wonder what's there now, Brain.

46:07.830 --> 46:12.721
CLAW : Now. the third item that I need ... Huh?

46:11.762 --> 46:16.366
"I'm so evil... Blah blah blah ... "

46:15.503 --> 46:16.845
Argh!

46:19.531 --> 46:21.736
As I was saying ...

46:21.257 --> 46:25.668
the third item to complete my super weapon.

46:26.148 --> 46:29.121
I know this one, the ruby!

46:28.546 --> 46:31.710
Yes, but a big ruby!

46:31.039 --> 46:36.122
say about 50,000 karats. Heh heh heh!

46:35.067 --> 46:36.602
Your Clawsomeness...

46:36.314 --> 46:39.670
where are we going to find a rock that big?

46:38.999 --> 46:41.397
The Riverton Museum.

46:40.917 --> 46:45.041
The ruby's on loan from the Raja of India...

46:44.274 --> 46:47.247
and will be on display Wednesday night...

46:46.575 --> 46:49.069
at the mayor's Fund-Raiser.

46:48.590 --> 46:50.891
We are going to stop by...

46:50.412 --> 46:53.768
and do a little fund-raising of our own.

46:56.550 --> 46:59.427
GADGET : Good evening. Ladies and Gentlemen ...

46:58.851 --> 47:04.222
and welcome to Mayor. Wilson's Fund-Raiser, orama ...

47:03.167 --> 47:04.701
MAYOR : Oh.

47:04.414 --> 47:08.058
CHIEF : Ow! Ohh.

47:07.291 --> 47:09.401
Gadget.

47:09.017 --> 47:11.319
Don't worry, Chief. No need to tip me.

47:10.839 --> 47:12.278
We better be getting inside.

47:11.990 --> 47:15.251
Yeah. It's nice in there.

47:16.498 --> 47:18.703
MAYOR : I'm here.

47:18.224 --> 47:21.868
Good evening. Good evening, Everyone.

47:21.101 --> 47:23.594
Yes. it's me. Ha!

47:23.115 --> 47:26.280
Break out the cameras.

47:31.458 --> 47:36.350
Ooh, another photo-op.

47:39.706 --> 47:44.693
G2, notice anything suspicious
about those musicians?

47:43.734 --> 47:48.625
Aside from the fact the music doesn't match 
the instruments they're playing?

47:50.639 --> 47:53.133
Come on, Brain.

47:56.010 --> 47:59.462
Yep. This is definitely the place.

47:58.791 --> 48:01.093
At least the building's still here.

48:09.149 --> 48:10.300
I don't know, Brain. Spread is creepy.

48:14.232 --> 48:18.931
Welcome, sir. Welcome Lady Campbell,
how wonderful you could come.

48:17.972 --> 48:20.945
Lovely to see you, sir.

48:20.370 --> 48:24.110
Oh! Claw!

48:23.343 --> 48:24.973
Aah!

48:26.124 --> 48:28.234
CLAW : Greetings. Mayor..

48:27.850 --> 48:31.878
Hope you don't mind if we drop in
on your little party.

48:31.015 --> 48:35.043
Everybody stop right where you are.

48:34.276 --> 48:37.249
The festivities have just begun...

48:36.673 --> 48:40.414
and I can promise it's going to be a gas--

48:39.646 --> 48:42.427
Laughing gas, that is.

48:41.852 --> 48:44.633
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

48:44.058 --> 48:46.168
Ho ho ho ho!

48:45.784 --> 48:48.949
That's right. Laugh it up, Riverton...

48:48.278 --> 48:53.457
because I am having the last laugh now.

49:01.896 --> 49:05.541
Rah ha ha ha ha ha!

49:06.212 --> 49:10.431
<br>It must be
It must be quite a party.

49:09.568 --> 49:13.021
Do something to stop him, Chief Quimby.

49:14.076 --> 49:16.473
You'll never get away with this, Claw.

49:15.994 --> 49:18.008
We'll see.

49:17.624 --> 49:19.734
Ha Ha Ha Ha! G2, see.

49:19.255 --> 49:22.995
Very funny, Claw. But you forget ...

49:22.228 --> 49:25.201
I am unaffected by laughing gas.

49:24.625 --> 49:30.667
Now stop this felonious and unlawful act
or I shall have to use force.

49:29.517 --> 49:31.914
Ah, the lady Gadget.

49:31.435 --> 49:35.654
I've so looked forward to meeting you.

49:34.791 --> 49:37.668
I hope you don't fall victim tonight ...

49:37.093 --> 49:40.354
to my magnetic charm.

49:39.682 --> 49:42.464
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

49:48.506 --> 49:49.944
Ha Ha Ha Oh!

49:57.424 --> 50:00.397
Hee Hee Hee! Aah!

50:02.891 --> 50:05.001
Oh! Oh!

50:04.617 --> 50:07.399
Mmm! Unh!

50:14.400 --> 50:18.427
Now if you'll excuse me, G2...

50:17.660 --> 50:21.113
I have some shop lifting to do.

50:20.441 --> 50:23.606
Ha Ha Ha!

50:26.483 --> 50:30.224
It looks like someone's been here ...

50:29.457 --> 50:32.142
and recently, too.

50:35.115 --> 50:36.553
Aah!

50:38.471 --> 50:40.773
Thanks, Brain.

50:44.130 --> 50:46.527
Do you see that?

50:49.788 --> 50:52.473
Brain, look!

50:53.241 --> 50:56.405
It's a perfect match.

51:01.297 --> 51:02.927
GADGET : Done so soon?

51:02.639 --> 51:05.804
McKIBLE : Yeah. We were playing
the "Unfinished Symphony."

51:05.133 --> 51:10.312
BRICK : Yeah. And then we took
this giant ruby.

51:09.257 --> 51:13.860
Yeah. That was the name of our last song.

51:12.997 --> 51:15.874
You know "We took this giant ruby"?

51:17.217 --> 51:19.614
"Took this giant ruby"

51:19.135 --> 51:24.505
"Stole this giant ruby"

51:23.450 --> 51:26.328
Just a minute, there.

51:25.752 --> 51:27.287
Huh?

51:33.233 --> 51:35.343
Let me get that for you.

51:34.959 --> 51:36.493
CLAW : Thank you, Inspector.

51:36.110 --> 51:39.083
GADGET : That's it. Everybody in.

51:38.507 --> 51:39.562
Thank you.

51:39.370 --> 51:41.480
Nice to carpool, isn't it?

51:41.097 --> 51:43.782
Yeah. There.

51:46.563 --> 51:51.263
No tip. They stiffed me again.

51:50.304 --> 51:53.085
I live on tips!

51:53.948 --> 52:00.661
Brain, take a look at this.
Fuel cells ... that's what Claw

51:59.319 --> 52:04.114
Laser ... that's what Claw took
from the Science Convention.

52:03.155 --> 52:04.593
"Ruby"

52:05.456 --> 52:08.909
What would Claw want with a ruby?

52:10.539 --> 52:12.841
"QUANTUM PHYSICS FOR DIMWITES"

52:12.362 --> 52:16.485
OK, Claw's definitely up to something big.

52:15.622 --> 52:19.171
Wait a minute. I know what Claw's up to.

52:18.499 --> 52:19.554
He's going to build ...

52:20.897 --> 52:22.527
Come on, Brain!

52:27.802 --> 52:30.104
We're rich! Hey, Hey!

52:31.350 --> 52:35.570
Hey! How much do you think this
thing would fetch on E-bay?

52:34.707 --> 52:36.817
About $1.98.

52:36.433 --> 52:37.872
CLAW : No, nitwits.

52:37.584 --> 52:40.174
Once we've robbed the Federal Reserve...

52:39.694 --> 52:43.243
we can buy hundreds of these baubles.

52:42.475 --> 52:47.270
With my secret weapon,
Riverton will be defenseless ... 

52:46.312 --> 52:48.997
as will the rest of the world!

52:49.668 --> 52:51.970
I've got to tell Uncle Gadget.

52:51.490 --> 52:53.792
Come on.

53:01.560 --> 53:06.451
Well, it's an agent mini-Gadget.
Get her!

53:05.492 --> 53:07.218
JUNGLE BOB : Come on. Let's go!

53:06.931 --> 53:09.137
SQUINT : This way! Come on!

53:09.616 --> 53:11.726
Whoa! Ahh!

53:11.343 --> 53:14.987
McKIBLE : She's getting away!
I'll cut her off at the pass.

53:14.220 --> 53:16.617
Aah!

53:16.138 --> 53:18.727
Gotcha!

53:18.248 --> 53:20.357
Whoa! Ohh!

53:19.974 --> 53:21.700
Uhh ...

53:22.371 --> 53:24.577
Yeah! Get back here.

53:24.194 --> 53:25.920
Get her!

53:25.536 --> 53:29.468
Aah! 

53:30.044 --> 53:33.976
Hey, isn't this the place to get
new bowling shoes?

53:33.208 --> 53:35.319
MEN : No! Uh-uh.

53:36.661 --> 53:38.579
I assure you, Ms. Mayor.

53:38.196 --> 53:41.936
We'll do everything in our power
to apprehend Claw.

53:41.168 --> 53:42.319
G2 will be ...

53:42.127 --> 53:43.854
G2 is finished ...

53:43.470 --> 53:46.251
along with the whole Gadget program.

53:45.676 --> 53:47.690
It's time we reinvested ...

53:47.306 --> 53:50.951
in some good old-fashioned
policemen and women ....

53:50.279 --> 53:53.061
not these mechanical clowns.

53:52.485 --> 53:55.266
Ms. Mayor, if you just give me
another chance ...

53:54.691 --> 53:56.130
You had your chance.

53:55.842 --> 53:58.144
It's bad enough they stole the ruby...

53:57.664 --> 53:59.486
but what's worse...

53:59.103 --> 54:02.363
no one gave any money to my campaign.

54:03.706 --> 54:07.062
I should've learned my lesson with Gadget.

54:06.391 --> 54:13.104
This whole program is a total waste of time.

54:11.762 --> 54:12.913
Come on, G2.

54:12.625 --> 54:17.804
We're taking you to the precinct
for immediate deactivation.

54:16.749 --> 54:18.283
Deactivation?

54:17.996 --> 54:21.832
That's right. Deactivation.

54:32.477 --> 54:35.546
Hmm.

54:34.971 --> 54:38.135
GADGET : I'm sorry. G2.

54:41.300 --> 54:43.314
Thank you...

54:42.931 --> 54:45.808
but there's nothing you can do.

54:46.287 --> 54:48.685
Now, G2.

55:05.084 --> 55:09.304
Nothing I can do.

55:08.441 --> 55:10.935
Hmm.

55:11.606 --> 55:16.114
 Or is there?

55:22.731 --> 55:25.129
OK.

55:25.416 --> 55:31.170
Now, where's that light switch?

55:30.020 --> 55:33.760
Aah!

55:32.993 --> 55:34.911
Aah! Aah! Ow!

55:34.527 --> 55:37.212
Ohh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

55:39.226 --> 55:42.391
Wrong switch.

55:42.487 --> 55:46.994
 <br> Ah ...
Ah ...

56:18.835 --> 56:22.479
What happened?

56:21.712 --> 56:25.260
I reactivated you.

56:24.589 --> 56:29.672
Inspector Gadget, why would you do that?

56:28.617 --> 56:34.179
Well, I hate to see a good
detective get recycled ...

56:33.125 --> 56:35.906
and I've always had great admiration ...

56:35.330 --> 56:42.427
for your investigative abilities
and physical prowess ...

56:40.989 --> 56:46.455
your commanding voice.

56:46.839 --> 56:51.442
Inspector, are you saying you like me?

56:52.977 --> 56:57.868
Oh, I suppose. In a manner of speaking.

56:58.443 --> 57:03.238
Strictly professional.

57:03.238 --> 57:04.677
Huh?

57:08.033 --> 57:11.678
Mm-mmm. Ha ha ha.

57:10.910 --> 57:13.020
Thank you.

57:12.637 --> 57:14.555
You're welcome.

57:21.939 --> 57:25.009
Brain, What are you doing here?
Where's Penny?

57:26.735 --> 57:29.708
Ooh~ He's trying to tell me something.

57:29.132 --> 57:32.009
It's too bad I don't speak dog.

57:31.434 --> 57:33.640
If only dogs could talk like people.

57:33.160 --> 57:36.038
That would be good ... 

57:35.462 --> 57:41.887
Wait a second. I have an idea.

57:41.408 --> 57:45.532
All right, Brain. Now speak!

57:55.506 --> 57:57.424
Heh heh.

57:58.863 --> 58:00.685
Bowwow.

58:00.301 --> 58:03.946
Brain...speak something else.

58:03.274 --> 58:06.343
BRAIN : Check. Testing
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

58:05.672 --> 58:08.549
Penny has been kidnapped by Claw.

58:07.973 --> 58:13.056
Amazing! isn't it? what modern
technology can do?

58:12.097 --> 58:16.605
Wowsers! Penny's been kidnapped by Claw?

58:15.646 --> 58:21.112
Yeah, and Claw's had some sort of
giant laser and he's going to fire at

58:20.057 --> 58:27.058
He's holding Penny captive at the old
Bowl-Rite Bowling Factory on

58:25.620 --> 58:28.689
The bowling factory?

58:28.113 --> 58:31.086
Of course. The bowling shoe.

58:30.511 --> 58:33.484
Penny was right.

58:34.059 --> 58:37.512
I should've listened to her.

58:36.841 --> 58:42.019
She tried to tell me, and I didn't listen to her.
BRAIN : Speaking of listening...

58:41.924 --> 58:45.184
I'm getting a little tired of
liver-flavored kibble over time.

58:44.513 --> 58:49.404
Would it kill you to shell out
for a pork roast or prime rib?

58:48.829 --> 58:56.789
Look, G2! My niece's in trouble. I know that
you don't ever work with a partner but...

58:55.158 --> 58:57.556
I really need your help.

58:57.076 --> 59:00.720
Are you sure you want my help?

59:00.049 --> 59:05.708
I can't think of a better person
to go after a supervillain with.

59:05.995 --> 59:09.352
All right, let's do it!

59:08.681 --> 59:11.558
Let's kick some Claw tail.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.164
Ready? ... Ready.

59:37.260 --> 59:40.329
Let's go.

59:42.439 --> 59:45.795
McKIBLE : We're here. Your Clawsomeness.

59:45.124 --> 59:47.330
PENNY : Claw. you'll never get away with this.

59:46.851 --> 59:52.988
Penny, my dear, prepare to witness
a great historical moment.

59:51.837 --> 59:53.372
Your demise?

59:52.988 --> 59:57.400
Ha Ha Ha! I do enjoy your sense of humor.

59:56.537 --> 01:00:00.181
Now, it's almost 9:23.

59:59.510 --> 01:00:02.483
McKible! Activate the ray.

01:00:05.264 --> 01:00:09.004
Why can't evil geniuses ever say "please"?

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:10.443
He's a very busy man.

01:00:09.963 --> 01:00:12.553
I'm a busy man, too.

01:00:16.389 --> 01:00:19.841
Whoa ... Behold!

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:24.349
The greatest super weapon of the 21st Century.

01:00:23.294 --> 01:00:25.596
A bowling pin?

01:00:25.212 --> 01:00:27.322
CLAW : No. you dim-witted pea-brain.

01:00:26.843 --> 01:00:29.528
Watch and see.

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.227
Whoa.

01:00:34.035 --> 01:00:36.625
Double whoa.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:40.173
Meet the time displacement laser ...

01:00:39.406 --> 01:00:45.064
my crowning achievement in a lifetime of evil.

01:00:43.913 --> 01:00:49.476
Riverton doesn't stand a chance.

01:00:48.325 --> 01:00:51.394
Hurry, GADGET-MOBILE, before they
fire the giant laser.

01:00:50.818 --> 01:00:53.312
Can't you make this jalopy go any faster?

01:00:52.833 --> 01:00:54.846
Jalopy? Oh, yeah?

01:00:54.367 --> 01:01:01.464
Well, bring on the noise and bring on the funk
'cause I'm bringing out what's in my trunk.

01:01:04.149 --> 01:01:07.697
And just wait until I get into second gear.

01:01:07.026 --> 01:01:12.685
CLAW : Time for. Riverton to take a little snooze.

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:12.781
Ha Ha!

01:01:16.904 --> 01:01:18.631
Fire away!

01:01:18.247 --> 01:01:22.179
Ah Ha Ha!

01:01:46.922 --> 01:01:49.608
 Awesome!

01:01:49.032 --> 01:01:52.677
 Bomb's away!

01:01:53.827 --> 01:01:55.745
REPORTER : Over, here! Mayor. Wilson.

01:01:55.362 --> 01:01:58.239
Whoo ooh!

01:02:01.883 --> 01:02:03.610
It's gaining on us.

01:02:03.226 --> 01:02:05.144
Faster, Faster.

01:02:10.707 --> 01:02:14.734
GADGET : Wowsers! That was close.

01:02:17.324 --> 01:02:21.735
Riverton is in a deep freeze, Your Clawcity.

01:02:20.872 --> 01:02:23.941
That means time has stopped.

01:02:23.366 --> 01:02:25.763
That's what I said.

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:32.764
Good! Now we won't have any trouble with traffic.
Ha Ha Ha Ha!

01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:34.299
Uncle Gadget.

01:02:37.656 --> 01:02:40.149
The rail looks like it's stopped.
You think it's safe to go back?

01:02:39.669 --> 01:02:43.410
There's no time to waste.
We got to stop Claw and rescue Penny.

01:02:42.643 --> 01:02:45.520
Then to the Federal Reserve and step on it.

01:02:44.944 --> 01:02:47.821
It's time to kick some bad guy booty.

01:02:54.343 --> 01:02:58.658
We're just here to pick up a few
hundred billion in bullion.

01:02:57.795 --> 01:03:00.001
Hope you don't mind.

01:02:59.521 --> 01:03:05.084
I don't think he minds ... a bit.

01:03:09.304 --> 01:03:12.564
Time to show me the money.

01:03:38.267 --> 01:03:42.103
It'll take weeks to crack this thing.

01:03:41.336 --> 01:03:46.898
Not if you know the right people.

01:03:45.748 --> 01:03:49.296
Thank you. Mr. Bank Director..

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:53.324
Your services are no longer required.

01:04:06.846 --> 01:04:10.586
McKIBLE : We're rich! Rich!

01:04:09.819 --> 01:04:11.642
CLAW : OK. underlings...

01:04:11.258 --> 01:04:20.177
looks like the Federal Reserve is having
a 100% off sale! Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:22.095
GADGET-MOBILE : Out of my way,
G Team coming through.

01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:26.507
I'm going to need a really big piggy bank.

01:04:25.452 --> 01:04:25.452
McKIBLE : Come on, Brick! Faster! Faster!
CLAW : Now, let's see.

01:04:25.452 --> 01:04:34.850
Tomorrow we rob for N.O.X,
then on Tuesday, the Louvre.

01:04:32.932 --> 01:04:40.125
So much to steal, so little time
Wait! I've got all the time in the world.

01:04:42.522 --> 01:04:45.783
GADGET-MOBILE : The cavalry has arrived.

01:04:45.208 --> 01:04:47.510
Huh? Gadget again.

01:04:47.030 --> 01:04:50.770
Uncle Gadget, you're all right?

01:04:50.003 --> 01:04:51.921
Aah! Come here, you.

01:04:51.537 --> 01:04:53.743
Oh!

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:59.018
GADGET : The jig is up. Claw. You're under
arrest for kidnapping, bank robbery,

01:04:57.867 --> 01:05:00.073
and general all-around evil.

01:04:59.689 --> 01:05:02.375
The jig is most certainly not up.

01:05:01.799 --> 01:05:01.799
In fact, the jig is just about to destroy it.

01:05:01.799 --> 01:05:09.951
You want me to play dentist with your niece?

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:09.759
PENNY : Uncle Gadget! Help! Help!

01:05:09.471 --> 01:05:11.773
Brick! McKible!

01:05:11.294 --> 01:05:14.363
PENNY : Help!

01:05:13.787 --> 01:05:15.226
Get in there, you. Aah!

01:05:14.938 --> 01:05:17.719
Dr. Claw, what about us? Yeah man...

01:05:17.144 --> 01:05:21.268
You're minions, aren't you?
Get the good guys!

01:05:22.227 --> 01:05:25.392
PENNY : Uncle Gadget. help! help!

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:30.283
Help! Help me!

01:05:29.228 --> 01:05:31.721
I'll take care of these clowns.
You go after Claw.

01:05:31.242 --> 01:05:35.654
Good call, G2.

01:05:37.763 --> 01:05:39.490
Stupid glitches.

01:05:39.202 --> 01:05:43.134
I hate being last year's model.

01:05:42.367 --> 01:05:48.025
Here! let me give you something
from this year's model.

01:05:46.874 --> 01:05:49.655
Take one of my chips.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.450
G2, but...then you might get the glitches.

01:05:53.396 --> 01:05:55.122
I'll manage.

01:06:05.288 --> 01:06:09.507
OK. Better stand back.

01:06:13.631 --> 01:06:15.166
Whoa. It works.

01:06:14.878 --> 01:06:22.934
It works! It works!

01:06:24.085 --> 01:06:27.442
GADGET-MOBILE : You go get 'em. G.

01:06:27.921 --> 01:06:29.264
Whoa!

01:06:28.976 --> 01:06:31.086
This shouldn't take long.

01:06:30.606 --> 01:06:35.209
GADGET-MOBILE : Time to take out the trash.
G-girl and don't bother to recycle.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.143
Whoa! Whoa!

01:06:45.759 --> 01:06:47.773
Whoa!

01:06:56.308 --> 01:06:59.090
Dr. Claw, it's Gadget.

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:02.063
CLAW : Uhh. Not again.

01:07:01.296 --> 01:07:02.447
Oh, Uncle Gadget.

01:07:02.255 --> 01:07:03.789
Don't worry.

01:07:03.501 --> 01:07:06.666
Time for Gadget to go out with a bang.

01:07:08.584 --> 01:07:12.517
Help!

01:07:11.749 --> 01:07:14.435
 Ow!

01:07:25.943 --> 01:07:27.573
Sorry.

01:07:27.286 --> 01:07:31.026
Oh~~ No!
Ooh!

01:07:31.122 --> 01:07:32.656
He's still after us.

01:07:32.368 --> 01:07:34.095
CLAW : McKible. Lose him!

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:45.219
Hyah!

01:07:45.699 --> 01:07:47.521
Grr.

01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:06.318
Ouch.

01:08:05.935 --> 01:08:07.661
Oh, well.

01:08:07.277 --> 01:08:12.361
I guess when you have lemons, make lemonade.

01:08:11.881 --> 01:08:15.525
CLAW : Care for a smoke, Gadget?

01:08:25.308 --> 01:08:27.225
Aah!

01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:30.678
Ow ... ow ... ow ... ow!

01:08:29.911 --> 01:08:31.733
Aah!

01:08:33.363 --> 01:08:37.392
Ow ... ow ... ow ... Unh!

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:40.363
Puhh!

01:08:42.474 --> 01:08:47.366
PENNY : Uncle Gadget! Help!

01:09:03.094 --> 01:09:06.067
BOTH: Whoa!

01:09:07.889 --> 01:09:10.479
Oh. Huh?

01:09:09.999 --> 01:09:12.395
What is this? I can't move!

01:09:11.917 --> 01:09:14.890
I guess glitches sometimes
do have their benefits.

01:09:14.314 --> 01:09:16.904
Let me out! Hey! Get me out of here!

01:09:16.328 --> 01:09:19.685
Looks like this case is about wrapped up.

01:09:19.014 --> 01:09:22.946
Hey, I just made a joke.

01:09:27.933 --> 01:09:30.522
Unh! Hey, hey, hey!

01:09:30.042 --> 01:09:34.742
Huh! Huh! Huh!

01:09:33.783 --> 01:09:36.660
Gangway!

01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:38.674
Whoop ... Look out!

01:09:38.099 --> 01:09:40.975
Police emergency. Coming through.

01:09:48.167 --> 01:09:49.895
Whoop ... Excuse me.

01:09:49.607 --> 01:09:53.346
GADGET-MOBILE, we have to find
Inspector Gadget.

01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:56.320
No problem. Gadget homing device activated.

01:10:00.444 --> 01:10:03.034
Coming to get you, Claw.

01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:11.186
Huh! He's on the roof!

01:10:10.802 --> 01:10:12.432
on the roof?

01:10:12.145 --> 01:10:13.871
Uncle Gadget, help!

01:10:13.487 --> 01:10:15.885
McKible, get him off!

01:10:15.405 --> 01:10:17.515
Take some of that, Gadget!

01:10:17.132 --> 01:10:20.488
Whoa! Whoa!

01:10:19.817 --> 01:10:22.214
Whoa!

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:27.873
GADGET : Help!

01:10:27.202 --> 01:10:30.462
Time to switch to Plan "B"!

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:35.737
Ha ha.

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:48.875
Claw, stop the truck and come out
with your claw up!

01:10:47.533 --> 01:10:50.890
You know, Gadget, there's one true detective...

01:10:50.219 --> 01:10:52.616
in your family, and it isn't you.

01:10:52.137 --> 01:10:55.781
Too bad you didn't listen to her
when you had the chance.

01:10:55.014 --> 01:10:57.795
Penny? Penny?

01:10:57.219 --> 01:11:04.892
Now it's time to say good-bye
to me and to your partner!

01:11:08.057 --> 01:11:10.550
PENNY : Aah!

01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:11.797
Aah! Aah!

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:15.154
Uncle Gadget, help!

01:11:14.674 --> 01:11:20.141
She has 60 seconds! Ha ha ha ha!

01:11:20.428 --> 01:11:22.730
PENNY : Help me!

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:25.991
Don't worry, Penny! I'm coming!

01:11:26.854 --> 01:11:31.841
 Unh.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.622
Uh...

01:11:35.964 --> 01:11:38.458
Who put that there?

01:11:37.979 --> 01:11:40.376
PENNY : Uncle Gadget. help!

01:11:39.896 --> 01:11:42.007
Penny?

01:11:41.623 --> 01:11:46.227
Aah!

01:11:45.268 --> 01:11:47.089
Uncle Gadget!

01:11:46.706 --> 01:11:49.871
Penny, are you OK?

01:11:49.295 --> 01:11:51.213
Claw's getting away.

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:53.131
That's not important right now.

01:11:52.652 --> 01:11:56.200
Penny, you are the only thing
that matters to me.

01:11:57.639 --> 01:11:59.461
Uncle Gadget, the bomb--

01:11:59.078 --> 01:12:01.571
It's gonna explode! Hurry!

01:12:09.435 --> 01:12:11.353
Hurry!

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.285
Got it! Let's go!

01:12:21.135 --> 01:12:23.341
Whoa!

01:12:28.424 --> 01:12:31.206
Oh, no.

01:12:33.603 --> 01:12:36.000
CLAW : Ha ha ha ha!

01:12:35.521 --> 01:12:40.220
I always like my Gadget well done.

01:12:39.261 --> 01:12:43.481
I got here too late.

01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:46.742
GADGET-MOBILE : They're gone forever..

01:12:46.358 --> 01:12:51.058
It's the closest I've ever come
to being a family car.

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.633
Why?

01:12:54.222 --> 01:12:56.620
Uncle Gadget?

01:12:56.141 --> 01:12:57.867
Uncle Gadget?

01:12:58.826 --> 01:13:01.607
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

01:13:06.306 --> 01:13:10.718
Not to worry. I only landed on my head.

01:13:09.854 --> 01:13:12.828
They're alive! They're alive!

01:13:12.252 --> 01:13:14.266
They're alive!

01:13:13.883 --> 01:13:16.376
Uncle Gadget! 
Oh!

01:13:15.896 --> 01:13:17.815
You saved my life.

01:13:17.431 --> 01:13:20.500
I was so worried about you.

01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:21.842
G2 : Good Work, Penny.

01:13:21.459 --> 01:13:23.473
Thanks, G2.

01:13:24.336 --> 01:13:26.542
Brain!

01:13:27.405 --> 01:13:29.227
Glad to see you still fully
functioning, Gadget.

01:13:28.844 --> 01:13:32.296
Well, thank you, G2.

01:13:34.694 --> 01:13:36.516
Oh.

01:13:36.132 --> 01:13:39.585
No time to celebrate now.

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:43.325
We have to catch Claw.

01:13:42.366 --> 01:13:44.859
Let's go.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.106
Ooh. Ow.

01:13:45.818 --> 01:13:47.929
I'll go this way.

01:13:47.449 --> 01:13:50.902
GADGET-MOBILE : Hang on.
I know a shortcut.

01:14:11.138 --> 01:14:14.206
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

01:14:13.535 --> 01:14:15.837
What? Gadget again?

01:14:15.357 --> 01:14:18.618
There's only one way to deal with a pest.

01:14:18.042 --> 01:14:20.632
McKible, run him over.

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:23.796
One order of road kill coming right up.

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:34.826
Bubble gum?

01:14:34.346 --> 01:14:37.319
Bubble gum? Bubble gum?

01:14:45.184 --> 01:14:46.813
CLAW : Ha ha ha! Missed us!

01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:50.746
Looks like Gadget just blew his last bubble.

01:14:49.883 --> 01:14:51.801
Ha Ha Ha!

01:14:55.349 --> 01:14:58.322
I can't look.

01:14:57.747 --> 01:15:00.240
Hmm.

01:15:04.364 --> 01:15:06.090
Huh? 
Huh?

01:15:07.049 --> 01:15:11.269
Here comes the good part.

01:15:10.406 --> 01:15:12.804
ALL : Aah!

01:15:15.105 --> 01:15:17.023
Ha ha ha ha!

01:15:22.586 --> 01:15:24.983
Uhh! Let's get out of here!

01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.738
BOTH : Whoa!

01:15:32.848 --> 01:15:36.396
Now, that's what I call as sticky situation.

01:15:38.122 --> 01:15:43.301
What do we do now?
What we always do.

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:46.274
BOTH : We surrender!

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:52.412
Claw! come out with your hand
and your claw up!

01:15:55.577 --> 01:15:59.509
Whoa. 
What is that?

01:15:58.742 --> 01:16:01.043
McKIBLE : I never knew we had one of those.

01:16:00.563 --> 01:16:02.961
CLAW : You may have won this round...

01:16:02.481 --> 01:16:06.222
But, I'll get you next time, Gadget.

01:16:05.455 --> 01:16:09.387
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

01:16:19.265 --> 01:16:22.813
GADGET : Come on.
It's not responding.

01:16:22.142 --> 01:16:24.636
PENNY : He must've put in
his own security code.

01:16:24.156 --> 01:16:26.746
Then we'll just destroy it.
No!

01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:28.664
Then everyone will be frozen forever.

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:30.198
We just have to think like Claw.

01:16:29.814 --> 01:16:32.883
What kind of a code would
a supervillain put in?

01:16:32.212 --> 01:16:34.035
 <br>I got it.
I got it.

01:16:33.747 --> 01:16:37.966
And I just lost it.

01:16:37.103 --> 01:16:38.925
Hey! wait a minute. I know.

01:16:38.541 --> 01:16:42.953
Let's try "Crime always pays."

01:16:44.584 --> 01:16:46.693
Not always, Claw.

01:16:52.927 --> 01:16:54.941
Hmm.

01:16:54.558 --> 01:16:57.723
BOY : Oh. yeah!

01:17:11.245 --> 01:17:15.657
And for heroically foiling
Dr. Claw and saving Riverton ...

01:17:14.793 --> 01:17:18.917
I would like to award Inspectors Gadget and G2 ...

01:17:18.054 --> 01:17:23.329
these distinguished conduct medals
for their service to this city.

01:17:25.438 --> 01:17:27.069
Yay!

01:17:26.686 --> 01:17:30.234
Congratulations, Gadget.

01:17:29.563 --> 01:17:35.413
CHIEF : I'd like to announce
that we are going to double ...

01:17:34.262 --> 01:17:38.002
the Gadget Unit's budget for next year...

01:17:37.235 --> 01:17:43.181
so that if Claw ever tries to show
his face in Riverton again ...

01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:44.140
we'll be ready for him.

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:46.058
Excuse me, Chief. If I just can do possibly....

01:17:45.579 --> 01:17:46.346
Even just for a second.

01:17:52.196 --> 01:17:59.293
The real secret to our success
has always been teamwork ...

01:17:57.854 --> 01:18:00.156
but there's one member of our team ...

01:17:59.677 --> 01:18:03.129
who hasn't been acknowledged yet.

01:18:02.458 --> 01:18:06.390
And so, for providing key support
to members of the Gadget team ... 

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:11.856
I would like to award this
Junior Inspector medal...

01:18:10.993 --> 01:18:16.556
to Penny for her meritorious conduct.

01:18:23.173 --> 01:18:25.858
I couldn't have done it without you, Penny.

01:18:25.378 --> 01:18:27.489
You are one special kid...

01:18:27.009 --> 01:18:30.270
and I'm proud to have you as a partner.

01:18:29.599 --> 01:18:31.804
Thanks, Uncle Gadget.

01:18:39.956 --> 01:18:43.313
Yes, Brain. You're special, too

01:18:44.272 --> 01:18:46.957
GADGET-MOBILE : Hello? Anybody remember ...

01:18:46.478 --> 01:18:48.875
the internal combustion member of the team?

01:18:48.395 --> 01:18:51.944
What am I scrap metal? I helped. too.

01:18:51.177 --> 01:18:52.807
Where's my citation?

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.821
What are you doing, man?

01:18:54.342 --> 01:18:57.411
Ooh! not that kind of citation.

01:18:56.835 --> 01:19:00.768
Good night, Gadget. See you Monday.

01:18:59.904 --> 01:19:01.535
Good night, Baxter.

01:19:01.247 --> 01:19:05.275
Night, Baxter.
Bye. Come on, Brain.

01:19:04.508 --> 01:19:06.138
Inspector.

01:19:07.481 --> 01:19:12.755
I wanted to say I may have been a bit premature
in my early evaluation of your abilities.

01:19:11.701 --> 01:19:14.865
Well, that's very big of you, G2.

01:19:14.194 --> 01:19:17.934
I was wrong to think of you
as inept, clumsy, imbecilic...

01:19:17.167 --> 01:19:18.318
Don't mention it.

01:19:18.126 --> 01:19:20.523
Obsolete, simple-minded, malfunctioning ...

01:19:20.044 --> 01:19:22.729
Yes, yes, I get the picture.

01:19:22.154 --> 01:19:28.963
Anyway, I look forward to more
teamwork in the future.

01:19:34.142 --> 01:19:35.581
Oh.

01:19:50.158 --> 01:19:52.076
I just love happy endings.

01:20:00.516 --> 01:20:03.872
It must be a loose wire or something else.

01:20:03.201 --> 01:20:07.804
I'll speak to Baxter about that.

01:20:06.941 --> 01:20:08.476
Don't bother.

01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:23.628
CHIEF : Huh? Oh.

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:28.328
Oh.
Oh.

01:20:33.411 --> 01:20:36.767
Gadget!

01:20:39.165 --> 01:20:42.426
"Get ready or not. 'cause here I come"

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:44.248
"Dance. dance. dance. Have some fun"

01:20:43.769 --> 01:20:46.645

"Try and find a different drum "

01:20:57.674 --> 01:21:03.237
"Not gonna quit. get up. get up. get up "

01:21:02.182 --> 01:21:05.251
"Stand up. gonna make some noise "

01:21:04.579 --> 01:21:07.648
"Sing until they hear. my voice "

01:21:07.073 --> 01:21:11.005
"Can't keep me down. get up. get up "

01:21:10.238 --> 01:21:14.266
"Get ready or not. 'cause here I come "

01:21:13.403 --> 01:21:15.800
"Dance. dance. dance. have some fun "

01:21:15.321 --> 01:21:18.102
"6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1 "

01:21:17.526 --> 01:21:19.924
"Get up. get up "

01:21:19.444 --> 01:21:23.281
"Get up. up. up. oh. whoa "

01:21:22.514 --> 01:21:23.952
"Up. up. up "

01:21:26.637 --> 01:21:30.761
"Rain falls down on my parade "

01:21:29.898 --> 01:21:32.871
"Lemons into lemonade "

01:21:32.296 --> 01:21:37.858
"Can't slow me down. no way. no way. no way "

01:21:36.707 --> 01:21:39.584
"Yesterday is in the past "

01:21:39.009 --> 01:21:41.886
"Dream on. tomorrow's comin' fast"

01:21:41.311 --> 01:21:45.530
"All you got is now. get up. get up "

01:21:44.763 --> 01:21:48.503
"Get ready or not. 'cause here I come "

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.518
"Dance. dance. dance. Have some fun "

01:21:49.942 --> 01:21:52.531

01:21:52.052 --> 01:21:54.545
"Get up. get up "

01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:57.710
"Get up. up. up. oh. whoa"

"Up. up. up"

01:22:05.095 --> 01:22:07.013
"Get up"

01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:09.506
"Get up"

01:22:08.931 --> 01:22:12.000
"Get up"

01:22:11.329 --> 01:22:14.206

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:16.316

01:22:15.836 --> 01:22:17.658
"Get up"

01:22:17.275 --> 01:22:21.302
"Hey. you. don't let 'em see you frown "

01:22:20.439 --> 01:22:23.413
"Come on. turn it upside down "

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:27.057

"Show 'em what you got"

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:37.126
"You got a lot"

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:38.374
