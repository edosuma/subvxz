00:01.335 --> 00:02.703
* Previously on BrainDead

00:02.736 --> 00:04.438
* Somebody told you that

00:04.472 --> 00:05.773
* This head-exploding
thing exists *

00:05.806 --> 00:07.208
* And now you're worried that

00:07.241 --> 00:09.510
* It comes from bioterrorists

00:09.543 --> 00:11.179
* You argue about politics

00:11.212 --> 00:13.381
* With coworkers
with whom you disagree *

00:15.083 --> 00:16.584
* Get the Space Bugs
in your head *

00:16.617 --> 00:18.119
* Space Bugs in your... *

00:18.152 --> 00:20.388
* Get the Space Bugs
in your head *

00:20.421 --> 00:22.623
* Space Bugs in your... *

00:22.656 --> 00:25.093
Some people with Space Bugs
in their heads experience

00:25.126 --> 00:27.061
stumbling, loss of balance
or loss of hearing in one ear.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.796
This is normal since part of
your brain needs to come out

00:28.829 --> 00:30.464
somewhere. Some people with
Space Bugs report an aversion

00:30.498 --> 00:32.200
to sex and also alcohol,
plus an interest in vegetables,

00:32.233 --> 00:33.367
vegetable juices,
and the curative properties

00:33.401 --> 00:34.502
of juicing in general.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.471
* Get the Space Bugs
in your head *

00:37.505 --> 00:39.407

* Get the Space Bugs

00:41.375 --> 00:44.312
* Space Bugs in your *
* Head...

00:49.383 --> 00:53.087
(whispers):
I thought I'd lost you.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.623
You did... for a while.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.725
Laurel, oh, my God,
there you are.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.493
Dad.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.263
(app squeals)

01:02.296 --> 01:03.597
(whispering):
He's infected.

01:03.631 --> 01:04.632
Laurel's dad.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.666
ROCHELLE:
Wait, shh.

01:05.699 --> 01:06.800
You don't know that.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.736
It's this...
Just...
get closer.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.108
(app squeals)

01:15.476 --> 01:18.479
You need to find a way
to silence that.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.518
(app squeals)

01:24.552 --> 01:26.320
Oh.
(squealing stops)

01:26.354 --> 01:28.656
This must be Laurel's
friends? Hello.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.724
Dean Healy.
This is Rochelle
and Gustav, Dad.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.560
Nice to meet you.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.795
What you got there?

01:35.829 --> 01:37.798
Uh, a-a speaker system.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.099
Uh, do you mind?

01:42.403 --> 01:44.272
Am I supposed to be hearing
something or...?

01:44.305 --> 01:45.373
Uh, eh...

01:45.406 --> 01:48.409
Gustav, we should
probably... go.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.711
Laurel, so glad
you're safe.

01:50.744 --> 01:51.845
Thank you,

01:51.879 --> 01:54.348
both.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.219
(whispering):
You need to tell her.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.220
(whispering): What?

01:59.253 --> 02:00.554
That her dad
is infected?

02:00.588 --> 02:01.622
Yes.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.557
Your machine said no.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.526
No, it didn't.

02:05.559 --> 02:08.229
It just stopped.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.130
It's broken.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.467
(theme music playing)

02:15.469 --> 02:17.638
Seems like a simple enough
concept, doesn't it?

02:17.671 --> 02:19.440
One person, one vote.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.808
Too bad no one got the message

02:20.841 --> 02:23.411
to the senators
on the "torture panel."

02:23.444 --> 02:26.480
("Anvil Chorus"
plays on television)

02:28.449 --> 02:29.583
RED:
Where are we, buddy?

02:29.617 --> 02:30.684
We're set up.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.420
What are you
looking for, Senator?

02:32.453 --> 02:34.422
This is the Capitol
security footage?

02:34.455 --> 02:36.324
Yeah, from today
and yesterday. Why?

02:36.357 --> 02:37.825
RED:
Get me the hallway

02:37.858 --> 02:39.193
outside the Intelligence
Committee hearing.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.197
There!

02:43.231 --> 02:44.698
Those people exiting.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.300
Freeze frame there.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.202
Those two black people.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.203
Who are they?

02:49.237 --> 02:50.304
And I'm not being racist.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.839
I'm just being descriptive.

02:51.872 --> 02:55.543
If they were dwarves,
I'd say, "Those two dwarves."

02:55.576 --> 02:57.811
I don't think you can
say dwarves, either.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.980
Well, good thing
they're not dwarves.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.283
Who are they?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.851
Come on, they were
here yesterday.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.219
Dr. Bobb

03:05.253 --> 03:07.955
and her, the...
Rachel something.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.657
What were they here about?

03:14.262 --> 03:15.996
Information
on the Intelligence meeting.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.599
Terrorist sympathizers.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.934
It starts in San Bernadino.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.270
It comes here.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.404
All right.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.672
Get that printed up,

03:24.705 --> 03:27.441
and have it ready for
the committee today.

03:40.521 --> 03:42.890
Hey.
Hey.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.258
Where are you going?

03:44.292 --> 03:45.326
I'll walk you.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.628
I was walking to you.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.667
Let me go first.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.536
Okay, forget what
I said about bugs.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.904
I-I don't want that
to get in the way...

03:56.937 --> 03:58.472
No, wait, nothing is
gonna get in the way.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.907
We just have so
many other hurdles,

03:59.940 --> 04:01.074
and I don't want you to
think that I'm insane.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.511
No, it's just a weird time,
and any one explanation makes

04:03.544 --> 04:05.479
just as much sense as any other.
Look, I just want to act normal
from now on.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.448
I just want to just get
a burger and fries and a beer.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.749
I don't want to...
Your friends are in trouble.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.984
What?
Your friends,
Dr. Bobb and Rochelle.

04:11.018 --> 04:11.985
They're in trouble.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.388
How?

04:14.422 --> 04:15.656
My boss saw
surveillance footage

04:15.689 --> 04:17.057
of them leaving
the Intelligence meeting,

04:17.090 --> 04:18.659
and he thinks that they
had something to do

04:18.692 --> 04:19.660
with the failed vote.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.862
What will he do?

04:21.895 --> 04:23.297
I don't know.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.035
It's working.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.036
It's not broken.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.070
Meaning?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.672
They changed their frequency.

04:31.705 --> 04:32.906
They knew we were
on to them,

04:32.940 --> 04:34.808
and they changed
their frequency.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.076
You don't know
that, Gustav.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.545
I know that you
should be telling

04:37.578 --> 04:40.348
Laurel about her father.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.649
Okay, guys, we need to talk.

04:41.682 --> 04:42.683
Hi, Laurel.
Hi.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.352
You're so nice... today.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.387
Good to see you.
What?

04:46.420 --> 04:47.821
(clears throat)
Well, uh, nothing.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.790
What do you mean?
(whispering):
Tell her.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.625
(whispering): No, I...
Tell her.
Okay.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.960
What?

04:52.993 --> 04:55.363
We're not certain
about this,

04:55.396 --> 04:57.064
because Gustav's toy here
went on the fritz...

04:57.097 --> 04:58.532
Ah, it's not a toy,

04:58.566 --> 04:59.633
and it didn't
go on the fritz.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.834
Stop.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.035
Rochelle.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.405
Gustav's machine reacts

05:04.438 --> 05:05.939
to high-frequency
communication...

05:05.973 --> 05:07.575
500 kilohertz.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.344
...and he was seeing who
was infected and who wasn't.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.546
Most of D.C. is
largely untouched.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.581
Most of the infections

05:13.614 --> 05:14.948
are on Capitol Hill,

05:14.982 --> 05:16.717
and only five percent
here are infected.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.453
Anyway, when we were
in your office,

05:19.487 --> 05:20.821
there seemed to be

05:20.854 --> 05:24.592
a high-frequency
communication coming from...

05:25.726 --> 05:28.028
...coming from your dad.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.565
It's not certain.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.966
It could mean anything.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.702
It couldn't mean anything.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.103
I got to go.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.138
Laurel, it might
not mean anything.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.374
I'll talk to you.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.977
Be careful, by the way.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.380
Senator Wheatus saw you
leaving the hearing yesterday

05:46.414 --> 05:47.615
and Gareth doesn't know
what he'll do.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.584
(gavel pounding)

05:50.618 --> 05:51.852
Thank you.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.654
I'm calling

05:53.687 --> 05:56.590
the Select Committee
on Intelligence to order.

05:56.624 --> 05:57.791
I need everyone to sit down.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.993
The matter

06:00.027 --> 06:03.831
under discussion today
is the recent spate

06:03.864 --> 06:06.500
of catastrophic head injuries.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.669
RED:
Explosions.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.604
Let's just drop the euphemism
and call them what they are.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.606
LUKE: Madam Chair, can we
have some order here?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.475
(gavel pounds)
That's enough.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.544
Senator, you will have
an opportunity to speak.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.512
I would like to be recognized,
Madam Chair.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.047
I'm-I'm, uh,
I'm raising my hand.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.815
Why not both hands?

06:21.849 --> 06:25.052
(laughter)

06:25.085 --> 06:27.421
Quiet.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.689
Yes, the...

06:28.722 --> 06:30.424
senator from Maryland

06:30.458 --> 06:31.158
is recognized.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.026
As per prior agreement,

06:33.060 --> 06:34.862
I have a witness.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.433
Ahmed Kadhimiya.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.734
I'm a former freedom fighter

06:40.768 --> 06:42.603
in the Islamic Ra'id Front.

06:42.636 --> 06:43.937
RED:
And, uh, could you tell us

06:43.971 --> 06:46.039
how you became a member
of the Ra'id,

06:46.073 --> 06:48.476
and what you did for this
terrorist organization?

06:48.509 --> 06:49.843
Yes.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.879
My mother was killed
in a drone attack.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.947
I had studied chemistry,

06:53.981 --> 06:57.084
so I helped the Ra'id create
a new methane-based compound.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.952
And what did this compound do?

06:58.986 --> 07:04.157
When injected under the skin,
it would make a head explode.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.426
(people gasping and murmuring)

07:08.996 --> 07:11.932
Thank you, Mr. Kadhimiya.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.803
And you did this
with the approval

07:15.836 --> 07:17.070
of the Syrian officials?

07:17.104 --> 07:18.171
I did.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.973
(people murmuring)

07:20.007 --> 07:21.675
LUKE:
W-wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.943
Are-are you
seriously saying

07:22.976 --> 07:25.078
this is state-sponsored
terrorism?

07:25.112 --> 07:27.981
I'm not saying anything.
I have a witness.
All right,
this is not a matter

07:28.015 --> 07:29.650
for this committee.
Only the president

07:29.683 --> 07:30.951
can conduct
international affairs.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.052
This is about war,

07:32.085 --> 07:33.220
and only Congress

07:33.253 --> 07:35.222
has the right to declare war.

07:35.255 --> 07:39.693
You will not be satisfied
until this country is at war.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.695
RED:
You won't be satisfied until

07:41.729 --> 07:42.830
this country is made
the laughingstock of the world.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.964
Oh, Laurel.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.567
Hey, you startled me.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.801
How are you, Dad?

07:47.835 --> 07:50.538
Not good.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.005
Have you been watching this?

07:52.039 --> 07:53.874
Red's sandbagging your brother.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.676
These Republicans,
all they want is to start

07:55.709 --> 07:56.677
another war.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.278
Look at this.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.013
RED:
Mr. Kadhimiya's testimony...

08:00.047 --> 08:01.248
What's wrong?

08:01.281 --> 08:03.116
Nothing.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.585
RED:
Fire up our bombers...

08:04.618 --> 08:05.753
You feeling okay?

08:05.786 --> 08:07.521
Yeah, sure. Why?

08:07.555 --> 08:08.822
I mean, I was just
about to go running.

08:08.856 --> 08:09.957
How's your hearing?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.024
My hearing?

08:11.058 --> 08:12.059
Good.

08:13.761 --> 08:15.629
(whispering):
Can you hear me?

08:15.663 --> 08:17.030
Yes, I can hear you.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.732
I'm not in the grave yet.

08:18.766 --> 08:19.733
(laughs)

08:19.767 --> 08:21.101
Just humor me, Dad.

08:21.134 --> 08:22.636
Okay, what do you need?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.607
(whispering):
How about now?

08:26.640 --> 08:29.309
I'm gonna go on
a run now, Laurel.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.144
If you want me to
get a hearing aid,

08:31.178 --> 08:32.813
I'll talk to
your mom, but

08:32.846 --> 08:35.749
I'm not as old
as you think.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.586
Dad.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.754
You couldn't hear
me, could you?

08:40.788 --> 08:42.756
I can always
hear you, dear.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.958
A father can always
hear his daughter.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.302
All right getting home?

08:55.335 --> 08:56.336
I am. Are you?

08:56.369 --> 08:57.337
Yeah.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.572
Call me.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.807
Yeah.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.337
*

09:47.955 --> 09:49.589
(passing car horn honking)

09:52.860 --> 09:54.995
(creaking)

10:08.676 --> 10:10.143
(clicks)

10:10.844 --> 10:12.846
(grunts)

10:12.880 --> 10:14.147
Ow!

10:16.149 --> 10:17.985
I dropped it.
Just a second.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.688
(grunts)
(grunts)

10:20.721 --> 10:23.023
(heavy breathing)

10:25.125 --> 10:27.227
Where are you?

10:27.260 --> 10:29.697
I need your help.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.964
I caught one.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.002
*

10:43.977 --> 10:45.145
Do you have any more questions,
Senator?

10:45.178 --> 10:47.147
No. There's nothing more to add.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.817
Anything from the ranking chair?

10:49.850 --> 10:51.151
Yes, thank you, Madam...

10:51.184 --> 10:53.386
Uh, let me.
I'll rip him a new one.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.755
Ella, let's
keep it...

10:54.788 --> 10:57.725
Uh, thank you
for speaking here today,

10:57.758 --> 10:59.727
Ahmed.

10:59.760 --> 11:03.396
Do you blame America
for your radicalism?

11:04.798 --> 11:06.366
Do I...?
(camera shutters clicking)

11:06.399 --> 11:08.902
I... What do you mean?

11:08.936 --> 11:10.804
You said
your mother was

11:10.838 --> 11:13.040
killed in a drone attack?

11:13.073 --> 11:16.043
Don't you blame America
for this?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.344
No.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.179
It was an Iranian drone.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.182
But built with our technology.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.217
No. Chinese.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.453
But isn't America
the real culprit

11:26.486 --> 11:29.056
here, because we...

11:29.089 --> 11:32.359
created the... idea...
of the drone?

11:32.392 --> 11:34.928
Let me... let me
ask this a different way.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.397
Why do you hate...

11:37.430 --> 11:39.466
America?

11:39.499 --> 11:41.935
Because of...

11:41.969 --> 11:43.937
(camera shutters clicking)

11:43.971 --> 11:46.206
...your freedom?

11:46.239 --> 11:48.475
Our entitlement.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.878
Our wealth inequality.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.813
The top one percent

11:52.846 --> 11:54.347
owns everything. I mean,

11:54.381 --> 11:55.816
look at our bankers.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.150
Isn't that why
you hate America?

11:57.184 --> 11:58.752
I-I... I guess.
So,

11:58.786 --> 12:01.154
we can't blame you, can we?

12:01.188 --> 12:02.489
We caused

12:02.522 --> 12:04.124
this terrorism.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.527
We are the real culprits.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.362
The rich get richer,
the poor get poorer.
Laurel!

12:09.396 --> 12:11.331
You sure you don't have
to get back to work?

12:11.364 --> 12:12.833
It happens every time
we elect a demagogue.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.167
What are you doing in there?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.536
Just washing my hands.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.906
Hey, Rochelle, I'm sending you
a photo of some pills.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.373
Can you tell me
what they're for?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.542
Yeah, sure.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.277
But I think
you should get over here.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.847
Why?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.816
We think we
caught one.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.451
Ow. My head hurts.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.386
You really took him down
with this?
Mm-hmm.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.022
Wow.
(laughs)

12:35.055 --> 12:36.356
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.958
GUSTAV:
Shut up, bug man.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.060
You did this.
Yeah, because
you startled me.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.929
I-I just wanted
to steal your knives

12:41.962 --> 12:43.964
and get out of here.
Seriously? That's your story?

12:43.997 --> 12:46.233
Knives?
Look, you can't keep me
here. I-I have a family.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.036
They'll come looking for me.
What is this?

12:49.069 --> 12:52.072
GUSTAV:
It's to keep you from sending
out high-frequency bug signals.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.874
Oh, my God, you're crazy.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.909
What are you doing?
Checking your ear.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.011
What's the bug agenda?

12:58.045 --> 13:00.147
What are you talking about?
The bug agenda?

13:00.180 --> 13:02.549
What is it? Are you
from outer space?
Yeah.
Hmm.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.151
I'm from outer space,
just here for a visit.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.853
What is that, bug sarcasm?

13:05.886 --> 13:07.420
Anything?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.122
Some scar tissue
in one ear.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.423
But it could've healed.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.025
Or it could be from

13:12.059 --> 13:14.161
a near-drowning accident
I had when I was six.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.896
Oh, that sounded
rehearsed, didn't it?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.898
Look, let me go now,
and I won't press charges.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.399
Press charges?

13:19.432 --> 13:22.302
You broke into my apartment
and tried to stab me.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.838
Then get the police.
Call them.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.908
What do you think?

13:32.179 --> 13:34.347
Are you okay?

13:34.381 --> 13:36.850
Does Dad have Parkinson's?

13:39.953 --> 13:42.289
Hmm.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.058
Did Dad say something?
No.

13:45.092 --> 13:48.195
I was looking through
his medicine cabinet.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.364
Levodopa?

13:53.934 --> 13:56.336
(sighs)

13:56.369 --> 13:59.406
Yes. He does.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.576
Didn't somebody think it
was a good idea to tell me?

14:03.610 --> 14:05.045
He didn't tell me.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.613
I saw his hands shaking,
so I asked Mom.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.916
You know Dad.
He doesn't like people

14:08.949 --> 14:10.984
to see any weakness, or...

14:11.018 --> 14:12.953
Is it terminal?

14:12.986 --> 14:14.955
Yeah. Stage three.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.156
How long?

14:16.189 --> 14:18.291
Six months to a year.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.662
Oh, my God.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.998
Yeah.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.434
Why do you think
he wanted you to come home?

14:27.467 --> 14:29.970
He...?

14:30.003 --> 14:32.172
He what?

14:32.205 --> 14:35.142
Yeah, he wanted you
to come home

14:35.175 --> 14:37.911
so he can spend time
with you, Laurel.

14:39.612 --> 14:42.182
He said it was
about working here.

14:42.215 --> 14:46.086
Yeah, I mean, that's Dad.
That's what he does.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.260
He loves you.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.968
(crying)

15:08.308 --> 15:09.642
(sniffling)

15:09.676 --> 15:11.144
(sighs)

15:11.178 --> 15:12.679
Okay, let's review.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.481
You tested this chemical

15:14.514 --> 15:17.617
on everyday Syrians,
like these?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.519
Yes. First corpses.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.289
Then we needed live hosts.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.391
And you watched
heads explode?
I did.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.526
I'm sorry to say.
Hmm.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.297
Um, is that all
the testing you did?

15:30.330 --> 15:34.234
No. We first started
on zoo animals.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.303
RED:
You blew up

15:36.336 --> 15:38.405
the heads of zoo animals?
Yes.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.440
Animals
from the Syrian National Zoo.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.643
Yeah. What... what
kind of animals?

15:43.676 --> 15:46.046
Uh... zebras,

15:46.079 --> 15:48.148
two giraffes and

15:48.181 --> 15:49.582
pandas.

15:49.616 --> 15:53.386
Pandas? You-you blew up pandas
like these?

15:53.420 --> 15:55.455
Yes.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.990
Like those.
Just the heads.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.258
LUKE:
Madam Chair,

15:58.291 --> 15:59.459
what is the relevance of this?

15:59.492 --> 16:01.194
The relevance is that I care

16:01.228 --> 16:04.064
about what happens to pandas
like these, don't you?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.465
But... yes, but, uh,
more importantly,

16:05.498 --> 16:07.267
I want to know
if this witness

16:07.300 --> 16:09.136
is telling the truth.
RED:
I'm sorry

16:09.169 --> 16:11.471
to see that my respected
colleague has a greater regard

16:11.504 --> 16:14.141
for the truth than he does
for the lives of pandas.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.076
LUKE:
Madam Chair, I ask that

16:16.109 --> 16:19.246
we be given time to investigate
this witness's claims.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.413
May I finish my questions first?

16:20.447 --> 16:22.215
Go on, Senator.
All right.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.352
Ahmed, is this testing
on zoo animals going on

16:25.385 --> 16:27.154
even as we speak?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.488
Yes, right now.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.390
They have a shipment
of baby seals.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.226
RED:
And will they continue
to blow up

16:33.260 --> 16:34.761
the heads of baby seals until

16:34.794 --> 16:37.097
we get boots
on the ground in Syria?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.765
AHMED:
Definitely.

16:38.798 --> 16:43.002
("You Might Think"
by The Cars playing backwards)

16:48.675 --> 16:50.510
What are you doing?

16:50.543 --> 16:54.314
It's "You Might Think"
played backwards.

16:56.149 --> 16:59.819
Gustav is trying to see
what works on him.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.721
You can't just
tie people up.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.556
We need
to call the police.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.226
(shouting):
No, we need
to figure out

17:06.259 --> 17:08.161
what the bugs want!
LAUREL:
He's denying he's infected,

17:08.195 --> 17:10.230
right?
Yes, but he would.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.532
So how are you gonna
get him to talk?

17:12.565 --> 17:15.302
Can we put on some better music?
Tell me what you know.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.737
I'm gonna cut your fingers off
if you don't tell me.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.639
What do the bugs want?! Huh?
Hey, hey.

17:19.672 --> 17:21.508
What do they want?
Stop. Stop.
Okay...

17:21.541 --> 17:24.444
I don't know what you're talking
about. Please let me go.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.512
You can't do this.
Why not?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.614
He's not gonna talk to us
unless we threaten him.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.582
It's torture, Gustav.
Yeah. It's not like

17:29.616 --> 17:31.118
what happened with you.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.719
He's not human.
You don't know that.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.254
You guys aren't getting it.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.522
This is serious.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.457
This could be the end
of the world.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.426
Let's just hold off
for a while, okay?

17:39.459 --> 17:42.595
Let's-let's wait and-and see
if we can find out who he is.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.131
There's one
other thing.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.732
I talked to
my dad.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.168
Is he infected?
No.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.203
I don't... I don't know.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.205
Is there any way Parkinson's
could have made your machine

17:52.239 --> 17:53.506
give a false positive?
GUSTAV:
Your dad

17:53.540 --> 17:55.608
has Parkinson's?
The reaction of the brain

17:55.642 --> 17:58.211
could be the same.
It's possible. I don't know.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.147
Did you test his balance,
his-his hearing?

18:00.180 --> 18:01.481
I did. But it could be
Parkinson's related.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.815
Is there any other way to know

18:02.849 --> 18:04.417
if he's infected?

18:04.451 --> 18:05.718
Behavioral.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.255
Has he given up drinking
or... sex?

18:14.327 --> 18:15.595
You talking
to your mother?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.464
WOMAN:
The Jefferson Memorial,

18:17.497 --> 18:20.367
designed by John Russell Pope,
honors our third president.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.503
Though Pope's first design
was chosen in 1925,

18:23.536 --> 18:27.440
construction began with
a new design by Pope in 1938.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.476
Thank you so much
for such great questions.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.312
This is the end of our tour,
but I want you to know

18:32.345 --> 18:35.415
some important facts
about the Jefferson Memorial.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.586
The bronze statue,
sculpted by Rudulph Evans,

18:39.619 --> 18:41.588
is 10,000 pounds
and 19 feet tall.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.122
And that's it.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.898
Is Dean all right?

18:51.931 --> 18:53.900
He's all right.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.935
When's the last time
you saw him?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.804
Why?

18:57.837 --> 18:59.539
Because I'm asking.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.942
You never wanted anything
to do with me, Laurel.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.245
Because you're sleeping
with my father.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.546
I'm not judging you.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.715
I'm just wondering
why you're here.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.319
You know my dad's ill?

19:13.753 --> 19:16.289
I do.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.526
He told you before he told me?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.561
No. I guessed.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.363
He had tremors.
I told him to see a doctor.

19:23.396 --> 19:27.334
I went with him
to the doctor.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.535
He called you
in L.A. afterward

19:28.568 --> 19:29.902
to wish you a happy birthday.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.576
That's why he called? I...

19:36.609 --> 19:39.979
I thought
he got the date wrong.
No. He wanted

19:40.012 --> 19:41.581
to hear your voice.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.786
Has my dad's behavior changed
the past few weeks?

19:46.819 --> 19:48.521
What do you mean?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.557
I mean, I'm worried
his health has changed.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.693
Has he s...
stopped coming to you?

19:56.563 --> 19:58.365
Coming?

19:58.398 --> 20:00.867
Yes.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.770
He says it's just temporary,

20:03.803 --> 20:07.274
he'll be back
to his old self soon, but...

20:07.307 --> 20:08.775
You don't want to hear this.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.977
I don't, but I have to.

20:11.010 --> 20:14.447
I suggested Viagra.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.717
Thank you.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.419
Laurel?

20:20.753 --> 20:23.490
I wish we could talk sometime.

20:23.523 --> 20:26.493
I love your father.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.298
Okay.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.633
Thanks.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.048
You're infected, Dad.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.451
Laurel.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.753
You're back.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.288
I've heard of this book.

20:55.322 --> 20:56.956
DEAN:
Forever Juice.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.725
It's a godsend.
Makes my body a temple.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.027
Put your hand out, Dad.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.032
Hey!
It's not real.

21:06.065 --> 21:09.336
What are you talking about?
Your tremor is gone,
Dad. You're acting.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.903
Laurel...
I saw you in here
trying to figure out

21:10.937 --> 21:12.872
how to make it look real.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.342
I have something
to confess, Laurel.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.676
I have Parkinson's.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.646
I saw your mistress.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.381
What?

21:21.414 --> 21:22.882
Terri, your mistress

21:22.915 --> 21:24.984
for the last 15 years.
What are you talking about?

21:25.017 --> 21:26.519
Okay. What lie are
we dealing with, Dad?

21:26.553 --> 21:27.720
The one where you lie
about Parkinson's,

21:27.754 --> 21:29.021
or having a mistress,
or being infected?

21:29.055 --> 21:30.657
Which one do you
want to start with?
I stopped

21:30.690 --> 21:32.625
seeing that woman
when I swore to your mom...

21:32.659 --> 21:34.060
Oh, no, you saw her.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.662
Luke and I always knew.

21:35.695 --> 21:36.796
We'd go on mall tours
and try to figure out

21:36.829 --> 21:38.798
which guide it was.

21:38.831 --> 21:39.932
I'm not sleeping with her.

21:39.966 --> 21:40.933
Well, no. Not now.

21:40.967 --> 21:41.934
Not the past week.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.770
Because you're infected.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.478
We should talk.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.346
Oh, yeah.

21:53.380 --> 21:54.981
You start.

22:03.122 --> 22:06.092
Let me start by saying this:

22:06.125 --> 22:08.094
I understand where
you're coming from.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.596
You do?

22:09.629 --> 22:11.431
Where am I coming from?

22:11.464 --> 22:14.033
Fear of something different.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.436
You mean a fear of my dad
having bugs crawl

22:16.469 --> 22:18.104
into his head
and eat his brain?

22:18.137 --> 22:19.105
Half his brains.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.107
Oh, my God.
(laughs)

22:21.140 --> 22:22.875
Look, I'm still here.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.043
I'm still your dad.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.912
I know about how
you snuck out

22:25.945 --> 22:27.847
on your 13th birthday.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.016
I know about that
boy you slept with.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.618
Okay, Dad.
I'm still looking

22:31.651 --> 22:34.454
at you as a father
who loves his daughter.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.723
But you're infected.
Okay.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.925
Let's take this
step by step.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.126
There are good
parasites...

22:40.159 --> 22:42.495
Oh, God.
Tell me
that's not true.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.763
Antibiotics
are basically

22:43.796 --> 22:45.364
good parasites.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.600
Look at that.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.469
A week ago,
I couldn't do that.

22:49.502 --> 22:50.670
I was stage three,

22:50.703 --> 22:51.871
going on to stage four.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.072
And now look at me.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.774
I-I played
racquetball yesterday.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.142
Half your brain
is missing, Dad.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.878
And how much of that
brain was I really using?

22:58.911 --> 23:00.780
How much of Einstein's
brain was he using?

23:00.813 --> 23:03.149
No, Dad. You're not convincing
me that this is a good thing.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.617
Well, then let me
convince you

23:04.651 --> 23:06.619
that it's an inevitable thing.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.523
This is happening, honey.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.493
And people are going
to be better for it.

23:18.164 --> 23:19.832
Is it from space?

23:19.866 --> 23:21.000
Does it matter?

23:21.033 --> 23:22.535
It matters to me.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.003
Can't do anything
with the information.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.137
Well, then tell me.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.578
There's a force outside
of our petty concerns,

23:31.611 --> 23:34.747
and they want to help us.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.916
By controlling us?

23:36.949 --> 23:38.150
No.

23:38.184 --> 23:42.522
More like living...
beside us.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.861
You can come back, Dad.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.663
I did it.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.898
You just need to battle it

23:51.931 --> 23:53.132
with the right side
of your brain.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.167
(chuckles)
I did it.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.202
You can't use logic.

23:56.235 --> 23:57.537
You have to use
the opposite.

23:57.570 --> 24:01.073
And what does that do?

24:01.107 --> 24:04.043
Remember the driving trip
to Orlando?

24:04.076 --> 24:05.778
How we thought it
was so stupid.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.647
How we hated Disney World.
Hmm.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.682
And they only sold candy
in all the stores

24:09.716 --> 24:11.551
and all you wanted
was an apple.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.119
Just a simple apple.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.822
And all they had
were apple gummy bears,

24:15.855 --> 24:17.089
so you made a candy salad.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.691
That isn't illogical.

24:18.725 --> 24:19.826
Yes, it was.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.093
And the song.
You sang that song.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.829
You sang,
* I'm a dog, I'm a dog

24:22.862 --> 24:24.564
* I'm a dog, dog, dog.
Yeah, uh...

24:24.597 --> 24:25.565
That was stupid.
(laughing)

24:25.598 --> 24:27.567
It made us laugh so hard.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.702
What do you want, babe?

24:29.736 --> 24:31.237
Do you want me to
go back to a state

24:31.270 --> 24:32.972
where I have a
year to live?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.807
Where the last year
of my life

24:34.841 --> 24:35.975
will be in a wheelchair

24:36.008 --> 24:37.243
with your mother feeding me?

24:37.276 --> 24:39.979
Is that what you want?

24:42.715 --> 24:44.717
I want my dad.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.486
I'm your dad.

24:49.756 --> 24:50.857
No, you're not.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.625
Give me a hug.
No.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.760
Come on.

24:53.793 --> 24:54.761
It's me.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.028
Just let me hug you.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.132
(sighs)

25:05.805 --> 25:08.507
(helicopter blades whirring
in distance)

25:15.715 --> 25:16.749
KEVIN:
What's that?

25:16.783 --> 25:17.817
GUSTAV:
Three-year-old whiskey.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.652
I don't drink.
I know.

25:19.686 --> 25:20.920
Bug people
don't drink.

25:20.953 --> 25:23.289
No. I'm AA.
Two years sober.

25:23.322 --> 25:24.691
(inhales)
Where's your chip?

25:24.724 --> 25:25.892
My...
Yeah, your chip.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.059
Oh, my sobriety chip?

25:27.093 --> 25:29.095
It's in my other clothes.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.330
Drinkee, drinkee.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.632
Seriously... guys.

25:32.665 --> 25:33.800
Y-you'll be responsible

25:33.833 --> 25:34.934
for knocking me
off the wagon.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.569
This is torture.
Mm-hmm.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.571
Uh-uh-uh.
(gurgling)

25:38.605 --> 25:42.041
And you approved the testing
on the Syrian zoo animals?

25:42.074 --> 25:44.110
Yes. It was me.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.112
How did you get
access to them?

25:46.145 --> 25:47.980
The animals?
Yeah.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.650
Uh, by talking to our
other departments

25:50.683 --> 25:52.184
in the Syrian authority.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.786
And what department was that?

25:53.820 --> 25:54.921
The Council

25:54.954 --> 25:56.122
for Cultural Imperatives.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.590
You know, there is no

25:57.624 --> 25:59.025
Council for
Cultural Imperatives.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.828
Yes, there is.
No, there isn't.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.963
It might translate differently
into English.

26:05.665 --> 26:06.833
Give me the Syrian name.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.970
I thought we were on
the same side.

26:12.371 --> 26:13.673
And what side is that?

26:13.706 --> 26:15.307
You're prepping me for my

26:15.341 --> 26:17.677
Select Committee testimony.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.646
Yeah... and if
you're caught lying,

26:19.679 --> 26:21.147
that's not going to do
much good for our side,

26:21.180 --> 26:22.348
now does it?

26:22.381 --> 26:24.684
The People's Council
of Cultural Affairs.

26:24.717 --> 26:25.818
Is that what you
meant, Doctor?

26:25.852 --> 26:26.953
That's the council

26:26.986 --> 26:28.621
that supplied
the zoo animals?

26:28.655 --> 26:30.823
(laughing):
Yes. Exactly.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.692
Good. I think you're ready.

26:32.725 --> 26:33.760
GARETH:
Senator.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.928
Do you have a moment?

26:35.962 --> 26:37.096
I do.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.665
Many moments.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.640
He's lying.
How do you know?

26:47.674 --> 26:49.375
Because he changes his story
based on our needs.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.844
(scoffs)
Have you ever been
to Syria, buddy?

26:51.878 --> 26:53.312
No.
Well, I have.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.214
And it is not
a pretty sight.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.382
Actually,
I've never been,

26:56.415 --> 26:57.717
but that's
not the point.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.318
I have an imagination.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.087
It's war-torn.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.254
And he is suffering

27:02.288 --> 27:03.923
from post-partum
whatever.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.792
Posttraumatic stress.
Yes.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.326
He sometimes has
to be reminded

27:07.359 --> 27:09.929
of what he's saying,
because he's so upset

27:09.962 --> 27:11.397
about what happened.

27:11.430 --> 27:13.299
So let's not judge him.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.134
Let's just help him.

27:15.167 --> 27:16.302
You understand?

27:16.335 --> 27:18.004
Why do you want a war,
Senator?

27:18.037 --> 27:19.739
I don't want a war.

27:19.772 --> 27:22.008
We're a
peace-loving nation.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.143
But if we have
to go to war,

27:24.176 --> 27:25.912
I won't shy away.

27:25.945 --> 27:27.279
Will you?

27:27.313 --> 27:28.414
No, sir.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.749
Good.

27:29.782 --> 27:30.883
That's what
I'm looking for

27:30.917 --> 27:32.685
in a chief of staff.

27:54.741 --> 27:56.242
(sighs)

27:57.076 --> 27:59.712
Are you all right?

27:59.746 --> 28:01.247
Yeah.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.982
A burger just feels
like the best thing

28:03.015 --> 28:04.316
in the world right now.
(chuckles)

28:14.794 --> 28:16.162
You need to tell your brother

28:16.195 --> 28:19.198
about the next witness
at the Select hearing.

28:19.231 --> 28:20.967
He's lying.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.804
How do you know?

28:31.143 --> 28:32.211
This is when you're supposed

28:32.244 --> 28:33.412
to get ketchup on your lips

28:33.445 --> 28:35.782
so I can wipe it off.

28:41.387 --> 28:42.889
Oh. Excuse me.

28:42.922 --> 28:44.056
Miss, you have some...

28:44.090 --> 28:46.025
* You never say you love me

28:46.058 --> 28:48.227
* But you never
let me fight you *

28:48.260 --> 28:51.063
* Can't get you
off my mind, babe *

28:51.097 --> 28:54.133
* So I bought this dress
to spite you *

28:54.166 --> 28:55.902
* I'll wear it
'cause I hate you *

28:55.935 --> 28:58.905
* 'Cause you don't know
what you got *

28:58.938 --> 29:01.240
* Then I'll wear it
to your house *

29:01.273 --> 29:02.809
What is it?

29:02.842 --> 29:04.510
* And I'll let you
take it off *

29:04.543 --> 29:07.847
Are you close
with your parents?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.481
Yeah.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.851
Why?

29:11.884 --> 29:14.987
Are they divorced?

29:15.021 --> 29:17.523
No.

29:17.556 --> 29:18.958
They're the only people

29:18.991 --> 29:20.860
in North Judson,
Indiana who aren't.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.262
They have nothing in common,

29:23.295 --> 29:27.033
but they make it work.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.868
Yours?

29:28.901 --> 29:31.403
My parents have everything
in common,

29:31.437 --> 29:33.139
but they hate each other.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.407
(chuckles)
Really?

29:35.441 --> 29:38.410
No. Not really.

29:38.444 --> 29:42.882
My dad's had the same
mistress for 15 years.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.984
My mom likes her friends.

29:45.017 --> 29:45.918
I'm sorry.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.220
No. No. It just is.

29:49.421 --> 29:53.159
* But I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

29:53.192 --> 29:57.496
* I wanna be the one
who says good night. *

29:59.465 --> 30:01.267
What?

30:01.300 --> 30:02.902
My mom.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.070
Your mom?

30:04.103 --> 30:05.604
Yeah. I-I don't know
what I was thinking.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.573
I gotta go.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.880
Laurel. What a surprise.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.915
What about Mom?
What about her?

30:15.948 --> 30:17.183
Are you gonna infect her, too?

30:18.951 --> 30:20.319
I can't let you do that.

30:20.352 --> 30:21.587
How will you stop me?

30:21.620 --> 30:22.922
I'll tell her.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.290
Tell her she
has to move out

30:24.323 --> 30:26.325
because I have
parasites in my brain?

30:26.358 --> 30:27.459
Mom.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.195
Are you there?

30:30.362 --> 30:32.064
Laurel. How are you?

30:32.098 --> 30:33.265
I'm good.
How are you?

30:36.202 --> 30:37.569
Um... Laurel?

30:37.603 --> 30:39.906
Stay right there, Mom.
Laurel. This is...

30:39.939 --> 30:41.440
What are you doing?
DEAN: Laurel.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.342
You need to calm down.
We're fine.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.244
You need to move out, Mom.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.079
No... Why?

30:47.113 --> 30:49.648
Because Dad isn't who
he says he is.

30:49.681 --> 30:52.084
Your daughter is talking
complete nonsense, Liz.

30:52.118 --> 30:53.519
She's worried about my health.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.487
LAUREL:
No.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.026
Dad is still seeing Terri,
the tour guide.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.594
You bastard.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.096
Liz. It's not...

31:04.130 --> 31:05.331
You need to pack, Mom.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.533
This isn't true.
It is.

31:07.566 --> 31:08.567
You know it is.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.636
You bastard.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.671
You complete

31:12.704 --> 31:14.974
bastard.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.015
RED:
And where did you get all these
zoo animals, Doctor?

31:23.049 --> 31:25.017
The ones you exploded?

31:25.051 --> 31:28.154
The People's Council for, um,

31:28.187 --> 31:30.256
uh, Cultural Affairs.

31:32.091 --> 31:33.993
RED:
Well, thank you for coming
here today, Doctor.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.463
Is war the only thing

31:37.496 --> 31:39.966
that would stop the Syrians
in their tracks?

31:39.999 --> 31:43.602
War or...

31:45.004 --> 31:46.973
No. Just war.

31:47.006 --> 31:47.839
RED:
Okay.

31:47.873 --> 31:51.443
Your witness,
or whatever we say here.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.212
Thank you, Senator.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.947
Uh, Dr. Samira...

31:56.548 --> 31:58.417
Is that your lab coat?

32:00.152 --> 32:01.320
What?

32:02.154 --> 32:04.256
The coat you're wearing...

32:04.290 --> 32:06.525
your lab coat,
is it yours?

32:06.558 --> 32:09.428
I, uh... no.

32:09.461 --> 32:10.396
No.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.998
Uh, who gave it to you?

32:12.031 --> 32:14.000
Well, uh...
(clears throat)

32:15.601 --> 32:17.003
Red did.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.271
I see.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.407
Senator Wheatus.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.309
And did he get it
from a valet or...?

32:23.342 --> 32:24.710
Come on, this is outrageous.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.045
Where'd you
get it, Red?

32:26.078 --> 32:28.114
He is a doctor.
Why are you

32:28.147 --> 32:29.982
making fun of these
terrible head explosions?

32:30.016 --> 32:31.183
I'm not making
fun of anything.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.319
Isn't it true, Dr. Samira,

32:33.352 --> 32:35.054
that you've never
even been in Syria?

32:35.087 --> 32:36.388
RED:
You are so dead set
against confrontation...

32:36.422 --> 32:39.058
All I'm looking for
is the truth here.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.492
RED:
This is outrageous.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.261
You will just keep making up
these lies...
We can start
talking about...

32:42.294 --> 32:43.262
(gavel pounding)
Okay!
Are you even a doctor?

32:43.295 --> 32:44.263
That's enough.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.297
We're gonna take a break.

32:45.331 --> 32:46.598
Thank you.

32:46.632 --> 32:50.402
Senators Healy,
Pollack and Wheatus,

32:50.436 --> 32:52.338
we need you to stay here
for a second.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.240
(indistinct conversations)

32:55.774 --> 32:57.409
I have been given
permission by my director

32:57.443 --> 32:59.611
in the foreign bureau
to brief you

32:59.645 --> 33:02.548
on a few matters
regarding Syria.

33:02.581 --> 33:05.584
This is class four confidential,
so you can't take notes...

33:07.786 --> 33:09.521
...and you cannot repeat
what is said here to anyone.

33:09.555 --> 33:10.756
Before I continue,

33:10.789 --> 33:12.258
I need to know
that you understand.

33:12.291 --> 33:13.125
I understand.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.061
I understand.

33:15.561 --> 33:17.163
I understand.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.133
I understand.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.669
There is no chemical program

33:23.702 --> 33:25.237
in Syria.

33:25.271 --> 33:26.505
There is no attempt to bring

33:26.538 --> 33:28.507
bioterrorism
to the United States.

33:28.540 --> 33:32.111
The witnesses you interviewed
today and yesterday were frauds.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.545
We can't say any more
without revealing

33:33.579 --> 33:35.147
ongoing investigations,

33:35.181 --> 33:36.415
so this is only
for this room.

33:40.186 --> 33:43.289
But there is no reason,
and I mean none,

33:43.322 --> 33:46.192
for suspecting Syria
of state-sponsored terrorism.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.359
Do you understand?

33:47.393 --> 33:49.428
I do, yes.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.729
I do.

33:50.762 --> 33:55.167
I do. Senator?

33:55.201 --> 33:56.468
Oh, yeah.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.836
I get it.
All's good here.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.737
Good.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.072
I'm sure you understand,

34:00.106 --> 34:01.440
but that's all I can say.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.075
That's all I can ever say.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.244
Yeah, I understand.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.780
This is not healthy
for me, you know?

34:08.814 --> 34:10.382
(laughing)

34:10.416 --> 34:12.151
It's not healthy for the bugs?

34:12.184 --> 34:14.620
Oh, no, they don't care.
They just want a well-run car.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.323
Wouldn't you? Would you steal
a car that needs oil?

34:17.356 --> 34:19.558
So we're just
cars to them?

34:19.591 --> 34:21.393
You said that, I didn't.
No.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.694
You said it.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.563
The thing is,
I don't like alcohol.

34:24.596 --> 34:25.864
Are they from outer space,

34:25.897 --> 34:27.766
the bugs?
Yeah. Don't say "aliens."

34:27.799 --> 34:29.468
They don't like
the word "aliens."

34:29.501 --> 34:30.702
What do they want here?

34:30.736 --> 34:33.139
Oh, they just want
a place to live.

34:33.172 --> 34:36.308
They want a place to call home.
They live in us?

34:36.342 --> 34:38.244
Yeah.
And what about
the extremism?

34:38.277 --> 34:40.279
Why are they making people
more extreme?

34:40.312 --> 34:42.314
'Cause that makes it harder for

34:42.348 --> 34:44.516
people to fight them. They're
too busy fighting each other.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.818
Republicans, Democrats.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.388
Americans, Russians.
Why "You Might Think"?

34:49.421 --> 34:52.558
What?
The song, "You Might Think"--
why do you all like it?

34:52.591 --> 34:55.194
Why not?
It's a beautiful song.

34:55.227 --> 34:57.463
Don't-don't you think
it's beautiful?

34:57.496 --> 34:58.764
No. I don't.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.832
It is the most
beautiful song

35:00.866 --> 35:02.868
ever written.
Yeah.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.703
It sounds like
your home planet?

35:04.736 --> 35:07.206
What? Yeah.
I guess it does.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.374
I never thought of that. Yeah.

35:08.407 --> 35:09.775
You want to dominate us,
don't you?

35:09.808 --> 35:11.643
You want to take us over?
Is that it?

35:11.677 --> 35:14.380
Come on. It's such
an old-fashioned concept,

35:14.413 --> 35:16.382
who takes over who.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.550
You're probably just
as likely to overtake us.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.520
What?

35:21.553 --> 35:23.522
You said, you're likely

35:23.555 --> 35:25.624
to overtake us.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.259
So?

35:27.293 --> 35:29.661
Us.

35:29.695 --> 35:32.798
You're a bug,
and you're more bug

35:32.831 --> 35:34.500
than human.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.768
You got me drinking.
I don't know what I'm saying.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.304
LAUREL:
Yes, you do.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.639
You said "us."

35:40.672 --> 35:43.175
My dad is a bug.

35:48.847 --> 35:50.316
What the hell do you want?
(door closes)

35:50.349 --> 35:51.683
You know what I want.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.785
I have nothing in
common with you.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.687
You want welfare
for the poor.

35:55.721 --> 35:57.423
You want tax breaks
for the rich.

35:57.456 --> 35:59.725
Get the hell
out of here.

36:00.626 --> 36:02.428
Feel the Bern.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.297
Always Trump.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.702
Cute little queen.

36:10.736 --> 36:14.273
You got a problem with that?

36:31.290 --> 36:32.758
You know you want it.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.327
Not as much as you.

36:36.562 --> 36:38.497
Smell that.
You smell like a bitch.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.865
A bitch you want.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.733
You know you want it.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.835
Force me.
Here it comes.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.737
Take it all.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.889
(sucking sound)

37:18.404 --> 37:20.406
(door closes)

37:26.712 --> 37:28.814
So you can't help
but infect others?

37:28.847 --> 37:31.450
It's in our DNA,
like yours.

37:31.483 --> 37:32.851
We need to multiply.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.521
Don't you?

37:35.554 --> 37:38.657
Why is Red Wheatus so intent
on this war with Syria?

37:38.690 --> 37:40.426
Why not?

37:40.459 --> 37:42.361
What, you want
to occupy us in squabbles?

37:42.394 --> 37:43.829
That would be nice.

37:43.862 --> 37:45.564
If we're tied down
in the Middle East,

37:45.597 --> 37:47.766
we won't have time to stop you
from conquering us?

37:47.799 --> 37:50.636
You know you're gonna
have to let me go?

37:50.669 --> 37:52.371
Why?

37:52.404 --> 37:54.573
'Cause it's not
in you to kill us.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.075
I've squashed a bug
on the floor before.
Yes.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.977
But I'm Kevin.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.979
Look at my
driver's license.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.849
I have a sister
and a family.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.951
I like foreign films.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.853
Have you seen
The Bicycle Thief?

38:07.886 --> 38:09.721
No, you're just using
the human side.

38:09.755 --> 38:12.991
No. I'm here, too. Hello.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.927
See? E necessario piantare

38:15.961 --> 38:19.731
i vostri semi in
un altro campo.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.300
That's a line from
The Bicycle Thief.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.909
You know you're gonna
have to let me go.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.082
Thank you, Senator.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.050
We just have
a few quick questions.

38:39.084 --> 38:41.487
Misty, this is a
very troubling time,

38:41.520 --> 38:44.623
but, uh, I always
have time for you.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.893
Now, you were briefed
by the CIA today, weren't you?

38:47.926 --> 38:50.028
I can't speak to
any specifics.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.697
Everything's
confidential, so...

38:51.730 --> 38:53.432
Of course.
We understand that, Senator,

38:53.465 --> 38:54.933
and we won't
press you on it,

38:54.966 --> 38:58.537
but can you tell us
what the CIA said?

38:58.570 --> 39:00.939
Unfortunately, no, uh...

39:00.972 --> 39:03.542
but I can say this.

39:03.575 --> 39:06.044
This... this
briefing today...

39:07.813 --> 39:09.681
...it stunned me.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.950
In all my 20 years

39:11.983 --> 39:14.786
as a senator,
I've never been so shocked

39:14.820 --> 39:16.121
as by what I heard today.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.889
LUKE:
Son of a bitch!

39:17.923 --> 39:20.158
He can't do that!
He-he can't.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.861
He-he didn't break
confidentiality.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.730
Oh, but he implied.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.032
Yes, but what we
heard was shocking.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.800
We were all shocked.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.703
You're kidding me?
We can't do anything.

39:31.737 --> 39:33.071
We can contradict Red.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.507
Not without breaking
confidentiality.

39:35.541 --> 39:38.510
Well, then we get Ella,
and the three of us censure Red.

39:38.544 --> 39:41.547
I don't think
that'll work.
Why?

39:41.580 --> 39:44.082
ELLA:
Yes, I was stunned.

39:44.115 --> 39:48.887
The CIA has asked us not
to divulge any of the details,

39:48.920 --> 39:52.123
and as much as I hate that--
like Edward Snowden,

39:52.157 --> 39:54.960
I want a society
free of secrets--

39:54.993 --> 39:57.629
I must fulfill my duty.

39:57.663 --> 40:02.534
All I can say is that I was
awestruck by what they said.

40:02.568 --> 40:03.902
MISTY:
And you are still pushing

40:03.935 --> 40:06.505
for a non-binding
War Powers resolution?

40:06.538 --> 40:08.507
I am.

40:08.540 --> 40:11.577
This is what
a baby seal looks like

40:11.610 --> 40:13.712
before its head is exploded.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.947
I can not let this happen.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.685
What are you doing?

40:20.852 --> 40:22.654
You won't regret this.

40:22.688 --> 40:25.791
Yes, I will,
but I've been outvoted.

40:55.086 --> 40:57.623
*

41:26.251 --> 41:28.754
*

41:35.761 --> 41:37.663
What's up?

41:37.696 --> 41:39.965
Close the door.

41:43.034 --> 41:45.203
I'm trying to figure out
whether to leak.

41:45.236 --> 41:47.072
And I'm telling
him not to.

41:47.105 --> 41:48.707
It'll hurt his presidential
chances in 2020.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.241
LUKE:
Yeah, but Red is
pushing us to war.

41:50.275 --> 41:51.843
He's suggesting

41:51.877 --> 41:53.845
something from a CIA briefing
I know is not true.

41:53.879 --> 41:56.247
But the only way to prove
it's not true is to leak,

41:56.281 --> 41:57.816
which he can't do.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.586
Unless it's the only way
to stop a war.

42:00.619 --> 42:03.989
No. Either way,
he can't leak a CIA briefing.

42:04.022 --> 42:07.192
Unless it's to stop a war.

42:07.225 --> 42:10.562
Okay, I need
to think about this.

42:10.596 --> 42:12.297
Thanks.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.602
(door opens)

42:18.069 --> 42:21.673
Are you gonna fight
me the whole way?

42:22.874 --> 42:24.710
What do you think?
