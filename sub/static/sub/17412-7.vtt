07:38.692 --> 07:40.459
       Kind of let me get
   a little more of that out

07:40.461 --> 07:42.027
 Than you probably should have.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.695
  - Yeah, it was uncomfortable
          for me too.

07:43.697 --> 07:47.098
  So I said marcus could spend
   the evening here with us.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.533
       - Well, a heads up
         would be nice.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.168
    Ha, it's gonna be great.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.103
   It's been too long, buddy.
      - What do you mean?

07:52.105 --> 07:54.206
      I saw you yesterday.
           - You did?

07:54.208 --> 07:56.107
     - When you says "see,"
         he means "see"

07:56.109 --> 07:58.043
   In, like, a broader sense,

07:58.045 --> 07:59.878
    So like, "I see a vision
        of world peace."

07:59.880 --> 08:01.046
     That's what he means.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.514
          - No, I mean
      I saw you yesterday,

08:02.516 --> 08:04.149
    'cause you were playing
     video games with will.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.719
   You kept screaming, "I am
  the lord of hand grenades!"

08:07.721 --> 08:10.121
   - You were supposed to be
  minivan shopping yesterday.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.090
    - I was minivan shopping
           yesterday.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.558
     I was doing research.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.060
  - Ooh, that was a major dtl,
           wasn't it?

08:15.062 --> 08:17.229
           - Marcus.
        - What's a dtl?

08:17.231 --> 08:18.964
         - Well, dtl is
      "don't tell laurie."

08:20.099 --> 08:21.867
       Now that I hear it
           out loud,

08:21.869 --> 08:26.004
           Dtl itself
         may be a dtl.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.005
           - [sighs]

08:27.007 --> 08:28.206
   Was that only five miles?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.108
    It seemed a lot shorter.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.576
  I saw a couple nice coyotes
             there.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.178
     They looked friendly.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.980
   - All right, who is ready
        for some bubbly?

08:34.982 --> 08:39.083
   - Let's see if I remember
   how to do this correctly.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.253
          One, two...

08:41.255 --> 08:42.687
          There we go.
             - Ooh!

08:42.688 --> 08:44.188
             Okay.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.092
      Do you always drink
        before you hike?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.827
  - Only on the special hikes.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.529
          - Thank you.
        - There we are.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.664
  - Here's to a perfect date.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.100
           - Cheers!
          All: Cheers.

08:55.102 --> 08:58.737
 - That is delicious prosecco.
    - Care for pro-seconds?

08:58.739 --> 09:01.273
          [both laugh]

09:01.275 --> 09:03.208
- Look at that, they're getting
      along great, right?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.809
    They both have the same
    terrible sense of humor.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.011
        What do you say
        we bag the hike

09:06.013 --> 09:07.779
           And go do
 our own romantic thing, right?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.948
 You know, leave the two nerds
   with their prosecco puns.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.317
     Come on, it'll be fun.
  We got me, you, the sunset.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.653
       - I have to check
       with fiona, okay?

09:14.655 --> 09:17.155
     - Will, help me gather
         some firewood?

09:17.157 --> 09:18.723
   - So it looks like things
        are going great.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.192
          - Yeah, no,
      I-I think they are.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.827
     - How about will and I
         skip the hike

09:22.829 --> 09:24.296
        And give you two
        some alone time?

09:24.298 --> 09:27.899
       - Yeah, I think--
  I think that would be okay.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.670
   And the prosecco is really
taking the edge off my anxiety.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.171
  - Oh, masking your feelings
         with alcohol.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.140
  I'm so proud of you. Cheers.
            - Great.

09:35.142 --> 09:38.143
            - Okay.
         Have a blast!

09:38.145 --> 09:39.110
            - Okay.
           Oh, wait.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.312
      Just one big thing.

09:40.314 --> 09:42.047
       If there's a lull
      in the conversation,

09:42.049 --> 09:43.815
      I'm good to get out
     the trusty uke, right?

09:43.817 --> 09:46.017
      - No, you can't uke
        on a first date.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.787
   You can't uke on any date.
          Promise me.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.822
    - I can't promise that.
           - Please.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.825
          - All right,
           firewood.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.794
         - Promise me.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.696
         - Who is ready
     to get their hike on?

09:57.698 --> 09:59.164
          - Actually--
      - um, we're gonna--

09:59.166 --> 10:02.067
      - I'm ready for us--
  all four of us to go hiking,

10:02.069 --> 10:03.668
         All four of us
           together.

10:03.670 --> 10:07.072
            - Great.
         - Okay, okay.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.206
      She's got a ukulele
          in her bag.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.975
        A ukulele, will!
             - So?

10:09.977 --> 10:11.910
     She always has a uke.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.079
    You just broke the rule.
      I was making a move.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.081
            - What?
I'm not ready to be left alone.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.016
            My rule
       trumps your rule.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.851
        - What are you--
 we never talked about trumps.

10:19.853 --> 10:20.986
    - They're getting away!

10:20.988 --> 10:24.389
- Here, and I don't want to hear
        any complaining.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.358
        - I get noodles
         and no sauce.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.259
      - I get plain sauce,
          no noodles.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.161
      - I can't keep track
       of what you guys--

10:30.163 --> 10:31.296
 Honey, do you see what they're
        doing right now?

10:31.298 --> 10:34.165
         [kids whining]
        - you know what?

10:34.167 --> 10:36.067
     You'll have this one,
   and you'll have this one,

10:36.069 --> 10:38.336
       And everybody has
     what they want, right?

10:38.338 --> 10:40.805
         - Wow, laurie,
     you're good with kids.

10:40.807 --> 10:41.940
        A real natural.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.642
      Why is andy the one
        who stays home?

10:43.644 --> 10:46.044
        - Well, marcus,
     laurie loves her work.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.412
        That's why andy
         stays at home.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.081
       - Okay, actually,
     it's not that simple.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.250
      I don't love working
        60 hours a week

10:52.252 --> 10:53.985
   And never seeing my kids.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.388
       - But you do love
    going to a quiet office

10:56.390 --> 10:57.656
       Every single day,

10:57.658 --> 10:59.057
      Where everyone wipes
          themselves.

10:59.059 --> 11:03.328
  I once heard andy tell will
 that letting you have a career

11:03.330 --> 11:06.131
   Was the toughest decision
         he ever made.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.234
          - This guy.
- Oh, letting me have a career.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.335
            - Hey...

11:10.337 --> 11:11.870
   - Did andy also tell will

11:11.872 --> 11:15.206
    That leaving my children
  every day rips my heart out?

11:15.208 --> 11:17.409
     The way I'm gonna rip
    his heart out right now.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.280
           - [laughs]

11:23.849 --> 11:25.350
       - All right, guys.
            Careful.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.951
          - Thank you.
            - Sure.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.153
             - Wow.
          - All right.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.287
             - Hey!
           Dead end.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.789
        Let's head back,
         get some eats.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.090
          - You know,
    it doesn't look so bad.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.859
  Let me just check this out.
         - Be careful.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.029
        - Here, milady.
             - Ooh.

11:38.031 --> 11:42.901
     - He is so chivalrous.
   - He's a pun with a stick.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.102
 - You can hold onto the stick
         the whole way.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.103
            - Okay.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.204
     - I'm gonna go first.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.074
          A gentleman
       always goes first.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.443
      - Here you go, man.
          - I'm good.

11:51.445 --> 11:52.844
        - Are you sure?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.245
       Those dress shoes
     don't really look like

11:54.247 --> 11:55.413
         They were made
          for hiking.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.082
      - I'll have you know
       these dress shoes

11:57.084 --> 11:59.250
      Are italian designer
         chukka boots,

11:59.252 --> 12:02.087
And they are military-inspired,
           my friend.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.089
         Military-in--

12:04.091 --> 12:05.190
      [all shout, scream]

12:05.192 --> 12:07.792
           - [groans]

12:13.466 --> 12:13.898
               .

12:13.900 --> 12:17.135
          I can walk.
 - No need to be a hero, will.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.903
          - You know,
       after university,

12:18.905 --> 12:21.806
    I hiked the great lakes
          of kashmir,

12:21.808 --> 12:24.309
      And it was wonderful
    up until the hookworms,

12:24.311 --> 12:26.211
       And they're sneaky
  little buggers--hookworms--

12:26.213 --> 12:28.913
    Because I didn't notice
         how distended

12:28.915 --> 12:31.750
     And bloated my abdomen
           had become

12:31.752 --> 12:35.520
   Until you get the painful,
   endless, bloody diarrhea--

12:35.522 --> 12:37.822
       - I'm gonna go use
  mother nature's powder room.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.090
      You care to join me?
             - No.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.091
       - Come on, fiona.
   Let's go to the bathroom.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.461
            - Okay.
        - Okay, come on.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.796
           Diarrhea?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.197
          [both groan]

12:46.199 --> 12:48.099
       - I kept thinking,
  "don't talk about hookworms.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.801
  Don't talk about hookworms,"
          and somehow,

12:49.803 --> 12:50.802
          I'm talking
        about hookworms.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.837
      - Okay, first dates
           are tough.

12:52.839 --> 12:55.807
    I've found that it helps
  just to be super agreeable.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.375
       Whatever he says,
        just go with it.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.210
      If he likes eggnog,
        you like eggnog.

12:59.212 --> 13:02.814
 - But you can say you like it
    to make chris feel good.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.449
 - Isn't that really dishonest?

13:04.451 --> 13:05.917
  - Oh, honey, no one's honest
        on a first date.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.152
       That's how you get
       to a second date.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.853
             - Oh.
            - Yeah.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.989
     - Okay, I can do that.
        - No, no, but--

13:10.991 --> 13:13.558
          - Um, chris.
            - Yeah?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.427
     - Do you like eggnog?
         - Not so much.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.329
        - Neither do I.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.436
  - All right, so I read alex
 <i> if you give a mouse a cookie,</i>

13:25.438 --> 13:28.173
       And I read madison
 <i> if you give a moose a muffin,</i>

13:28.175 --> 13:30.842
    And I finally got jonah
        to stop crying.

13:32.545 --> 13:33.845
       Something tells me

13:33.847 --> 13:35.280
           This isn't
    the comfortable silence

13:35.282 --> 13:38.383
         Of two lovers.

13:38.385 --> 13:42.053
   When conversation stalls,
 me and mom play a game called

13:42.055 --> 13:45.557
     And then we take turns
  asking each other questions

13:45.559 --> 13:47.525
      We always wondered.

13:47.527 --> 13:51.262
   Laurie, I always wondered

13:51.264 --> 13:55.867
     How you and andy met.

13:55.869 --> 13:56.935
            - He was
      in a pre-law class.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.536
          - Wow, see?
      That's interesting.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.871
          Andy wanted
        to be a lawyer.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.507
     - Well, neither did I,
     but apparently he did.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.909
        - I didn't want
        to be a lawyer.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.477
     I only took the class

14:06.479 --> 14:07.846

       a cute girl in it.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.480
        - Alison alpert?

14:09.482 --> 14:13.484
      Everybody loved her
   and her stupid shiny hair.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.953
   - It wasn't alison alpert.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.955
   There was a really smart,
       adorable brunette

14:16.957 --> 14:18.890
      That always gave me
          a hard time.

14:18.892 --> 14:22.327
       You remember her?

14:22.329 --> 14:23.928
             - Oh.

14:26.465 --> 14:29.868
       It's me, isn't it?
             - Yes.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.437
           It's you.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.939
     It's always been you.

14:39.211 --> 14:43.448

      grilled artichokes.

14:43.450 --> 14:47.652

     as they say in <i> españa.</i>

I hope you like herb mayonnaise.
         I make my own.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.156

           - Really?

14:52.158 --> 14:54.626

      heart attack cream?

   actually transcends teams.

  kind of a knicks guy myself.

       Then why don't you
  just be yourself around him?

17:08.795 --> 17:12.163

           that it is

18:06.419 --> 18:07.618

       I found your duck.

      eat around that bit.

             - Huh?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.678
        - The other day
     when I asked you out,

18:33.680 --> 18:36.147
          I said I had
       wet eye syndrome,

18:37.150 --> 18:39.150
         It's not even
        a real syndrome.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.487
      - I didn't think so.

18:42.489 --> 18:46.624
           - I cried
       because I'm weird.

  Also, I don't know anything
       about basketball,
