10:23.300 --> 10:25.400
Get there and get there fast.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.700
PauI Lopez, put a beIt

10:27.800 --> 10:30.300
I do not want to have

10:30.400 --> 10:34.100
Chin, if I see you on that ceII phone

10:34.200 --> 10:37.100
Eddie French, in my office,
you know why.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.000
Augustine, have you made a decision
yet on my caIcuIus Iab?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.700
Joe, do you reaIIy think I can get
speciaI funding for your six kids

10:42.800 --> 10:44.700
when I have aII the rest
of them to worry about?

10:44.800 --> 10:47.300
My six are the ones that have a chance.
They're smarter than--

10:47.300 --> 10:49.200
You know how I feeI
about ''smarter than.''

10:49.200 --> 10:52.700
There's kids out there seIIing drugs,
doing the caIcuIus in their heads.

10:52.700 --> 10:55.500
Now if you want to open up
that Iab to the rest of them,

10:55.500 --> 10:58.900
- maybe we couId swing a grant.
- Are you serious?

10:58.900 --> 11:00.500
Yes, I'm serious.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.700
Augustine, we have to honor the kids
that are exceIIing, not negIect them.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.600
Joe, we operate on Iimited resources--
morning, Gretchen.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.100
Yo, son, who died?

11:17.700 --> 11:19.900

Excuse me, sir,

11:25.300 --> 11:28.100

11:28.100 --> 11:30.300

11:30.300 --> 11:33.400
You mean ''You're weIcome,''

11:33.400 --> 11:35.400
Uh-huh.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.600
And what's this I hear about you
baiIing out on detention today?

11:46.700 --> 11:50.200
I'm not giving up my math cIub time
to babysit a bunch of deIinquents.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.900
Excuse me, those kids need
your attention as weII.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.700
But the ones who try
actuaIIy deserve it.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.600
Yo, son, what the heII

12:16.700 --> 12:18.200
She wasn't carrying nothin'.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.300
She couId've opened the door

12:20.400 --> 12:22.200
It's caIIed courtesy.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.900
Yeah, weII, it makes you

12:25.000 --> 12:27.600

12:27.600 --> 12:30.800
Man, punkass moves Iike that
won't get you no pIay around here.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.400
Trust me, I've tried it.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.600
Oh, I've got pIenty of pIay.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.800
You're kidding, right?

12:51.900 --> 12:53.800
Did you see that?

12:53.900 --> 12:57.300
Every singIe one of them
smiIed at me.

12:57.300 --> 12:59.700
Yeah, but you didn't
get no numbers.

12:59.800 --> 13:03.000
I didn't ask
for no numbers.

13:04.900 --> 13:07.500
Whatever.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.400
What about KIine? He hasn't
taken detention in months.

13:10.400 --> 13:12.300

13:12.400 --> 13:13.900

13:13.900 --> 13:18.500

- Mr. DuIaine.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.500
- Friend or foe?
- Too earIy to say.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
But check this out.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.100
He's been doing that
for everyone.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.600
And he stands every time
a woman waIks past.

13:30.700 --> 13:33.900
Freak.
It's just my Iuck.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.900
Have security standing by.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.300
Mr. DuIaine.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.600
Come on in.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.000
Eddie, sit your ass down.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.800
So what can I do for you?

13:56.900 --> 14:01.100
You're not a parent, you're not a sub,
you're certainIy not a cop.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.500
How can you teII aII this?

14:03.500 --> 14:07.400
If I depended on the students to teII me
what's going on, we'd aII be in troubIe.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.400
I've got five minutes,
Mr. DuIaine.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.100
Yeah, um...

14:12.100 --> 14:15.300
I ran into one of your
students on, eh, Saturday night--

14:15.300 --> 14:16.800
- How nice for you.
- Yeah...

14:16.800 --> 14:19.400
he was vandaIizing
private property.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.900
Did you fiIe

14:20.900 --> 14:23.100
No.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.200
I feIt I shouId
come to you.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.000
It's the wrong move.
I try to prevent crime from happening,

14:28.100 --> 14:31.200
but once it does, the poIice are
who you want to taIk to.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.900
So... good day.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.900
That's it?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.600
That's it for me.
Gretchen'II show you out.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.900
Oh oh oh,
hoId on, uh...

14:42.900 --> 14:46.100
who shouId I taIk to
about this?

14:49.200 --> 14:51.200
ProbabIy one
of your students, right?

14:51.300 --> 14:53.800
You must have a Iot
of angry kids at this schooI.

14:53.800 --> 14:57.000
Now if your kids were
as important to you as your car--

14:57.000 --> 14:59.500
Excuse me for caring
about my car, Mr. DuIaine.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.000
And do not taIk to me about angry kids
Iike you are some kind of expert.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.500
This is my schooI. I decide
what is or is not a priority.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.300
And these kids?
Are they your priorities?

15:10.300 --> 15:12.600
Honor roII?

15:12.700 --> 15:15.300
Those kids are dead,
Mr. DuIaine.

15:15.300 --> 15:18.200
Each and every one of them
kiIIed since I have been here.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.100
I keep them right there
to remind me of why I'm tired,

15:21.100 --> 15:23.700
and why I keep
coming to work

15:23.700 --> 15:26.100
and why I have
no time to waste.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.100
I'm sorry. Sorry.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.200
PIease excuse me.

15:32.300 --> 15:35.900
- Mr. DuIaine?
- I wouId Iike to heIp.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.200
There are numerous ways
community members

15:40.200 --> 15:42.300
can heIp the students
of John Drake High SchooI.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.500
There is a tutoring program.
There's Big Brothers.

15:44.500 --> 15:48.800
There's the math center, the Ianguage
skiIIs Iab, book cIub, DARE outreach--

15:48.800 --> 15:51.000
Y-yeah, I-I'm sure
these are fine programs,

15:51.100 --> 15:54.300
uh... but I have
my own methods.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.400
AII right, uh...

15:56.400 --> 16:00.200
I want to teach
your kids to dance.

16:00.200 --> 16:04.500
BeIieve me, the one thing
they do know is how to dance.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.300
- BaIIroom?
- What did you say?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.000
He said, ''baIIroom.''

16:09.000 --> 16:12.500
Uh, yeah.
WaItz, fox-trot,

16:12.600 --> 16:14.700
aII the basics.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.400
It wouId be great for them.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.800
Okay, where is
the camera?

16:20.900 --> 16:23.900
If you are taIking about teaching
my kids the fox-trot,

16:23.900 --> 16:25.700
I must be on teIevision.

16:25.700 --> 16:28.400
AII right, um,

16:28.400 --> 16:31.900
your kids, your caII.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.700
Thank you.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.700
Good morning.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.500
Mr. DuIaine! Wait.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.400
If you are serious,

16:46.500 --> 16:48.300
I just might have
an opening for you.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.100
You meet me back here
at 3:00 sharp.

16:50.100 --> 16:51.500
3:00?

16:51.600 --> 16:54.100
I'm not a particuIarIy
patient woman, Mr. DuIaine,

16:54.100 --> 16:56.000
either you want
to heIp out or you don't.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.200
I'II rearrange my scheduIe.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.200
I see you sneaking out
on me, Joe L.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.200
We have kids in there
for everything

17:10.200 --> 17:13.200
from steaIing someone's bag,
to cheating on exams--

17:13.300 --> 17:16.099
Hector, home safe--
to possession,

17:16.099 --> 17:18.800
vandaIism, to rearranging
somebody's face.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.500
BasicaIIy, if you get--
hat! Hat!

17:20.500 --> 17:23.200
If you can think of a way to cut
a corner and coIIect a dime,

17:23.300 --> 17:26.599
the kids in detention are aII over it
before we have had our morning coffee.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.600
- Detention?
- You said you wanted to heIp.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.100
BeIieve me,
these kids couId use some.

17:32.100 --> 17:34.400
Everyone eIse caIIs them
the schooI rejects.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.400
They're in here
for the rest of the term.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.800
In case you were wondering
why the scenic tour,

17:38.900 --> 17:41.000
detention's far
from a beauty spot,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.400
but it's the onIy space
we have avaiIabIe

17:43.400 --> 17:46.000
after some knuckIehead
burned up the study haII.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.600
On purpose?

17:47.600 --> 17:51.000
I got five bucks saying
you won't be back tomorrow.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.900
Miss James,

18:06.900 --> 18:09.200
what, you springing us
for good behavior or something?

18:09.900 --> 18:11.100
No, I'm not, Mr. Epps.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.500
Listen up, everybody,
this is Mr. DuIaine.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.200
Mr. DuIaine here is
running your detention

18:16.200 --> 18:18.600
and you wiII do
whatever Mr. DuIaine says.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.700
That's what you think.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.500
- Yeah, right.
- They're aII yours.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.900
Hey, gimme, gimme the baII.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.000
- Let's go, man.
- Wow! Right there.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.200
Yo, foIIow that queen.
Let's go.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.300
Pay attention,
pay attention.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.700
Okay, a'ight.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.200
My name is
Pierre DuIaine.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.000
But you--
you can caII me Pierre.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.400
- Pierre?!
- You don't sound French.

18:47.400 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, uh...
my mother was Spanish,

18:51.100 --> 18:52.600
my father was French.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.500
I understand
six Ianguages.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.400
- I speak five.
- Give me that.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.100
AII of them
with a Spanish accent.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Um, so...

19:04.100 --> 19:05.800
you are?

19:14.400 --> 19:15.600
Sir.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.400
That's Jason RockweII.

19:21.500 --> 19:25.400
Yeah, but you
can caII him Rock, Pierre.

19:25.400 --> 19:28.400
What about you,
mademoiseIIe?

19:28.500 --> 19:31.000
LaRhette,
LaRhette DudIey.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.100
Very nice
to meet you, LaRhette.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.100
So what kind
of teacher are you?

19:35.200 --> 19:37.800
Yeah, what'd you do
they made you run detention?

19:37.900 --> 19:40.300
- I asked to be here.
- Punkass move number two.

19:40.300 --> 19:43.800
I teach...
baIIroom dancing.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.900
- What?!
- BaIIroom dancing?

19:46.000 --> 19:49.500
And you... are going to Iearn
baIIroom dancing

19:49.600 --> 19:51.100
here in your detention.

19:57.800 --> 20:00.000
Nothing this wiId
ever happens in EngIish.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.700
Or bioIogy.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.500
The wiIdest thing yet
is that I said yes.

20:04.500 --> 20:06.500
You did what?

20:06.500 --> 20:09.100
I'm gonna arrange you
by height.

20:09.100 --> 20:13.900
You... and you.
Yeah, together.

20:13.900 --> 20:17.000
- No freaking way.
- Ooh!

20:17.000 --> 20:19.700
Mr. Epps, was it?
And the Iady to your right,

20:19.700 --> 20:23.600
Iet's have you and you together.
You two together.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.100
HoI-hoId on a sec.
Why I can't be with her?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.600
Not at this time, sir.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.400
Yeah, bu-but everybody know
Danjou can't dance.

20:30.400 --> 20:34.000
- Are you a dancer, sir?
- What, tu no sabes? I can shake it.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.600
Then I suggest you shake it
with the partner I assigned.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.300
Look, nobody wanted to host
the detention haII.

20:40.300 --> 20:43.000
- This is a joke.
- If I turn it over to Mr. DuIaine,

20:43.100 --> 20:45.100
we get our detention
haIIs for free.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.900
Detention is meant
to be a pIace

20:46.900 --> 20:50.200
where the kids who need to spend
extra time in schooI do just that--

20:50.200 --> 20:53.600
spend extra time in schooI.
Not dancing around.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.600
Joe, do you know
any of our students

20:55.700 --> 20:57.500
that are gonna want
to do baIIroom dancing?

20:57.500 --> 20:59.300
AbsoIuteIy not.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.400
ExactIy. I think I just discovered
the cure for cutting cIass,

21:03.400 --> 21:07.000
and for cheating, and for any
number of miscreant behaviors.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.800
- To the fox-trot!
- To the fox-trot!

21:09.800 --> 21:14.300
- You and... yes, you, together.
- HoId up, that's my cousin.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.700
- I can't dance with my cousin.
- Yeah, man.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.300
You know what? Me and Big GirI
can switch. I'II dance with Monster.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.900
Oh no, man...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.700
And you, sir, wiII be with
this IoveIy Iady over here.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.400
- No, he won't.
- Ooh-ooh.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.300
- More cousins, right?
- HeII no!

21:28.300 --> 21:31.000
- Uh-oh.
- Yo, I can't dance with him, for reaI.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.600
- Put me with anybody eIse.
- AII right--

21:33.600 --> 21:36.900
- She's trash, that's why.
- You shut the heII up.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.100
Hey hey hey hey.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.400
Yo, roII up!

21:44.500 --> 21:46.100
I don't want
to be here anyway.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.600
- Hey, hoId--
- Bye.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.200
We're out of here, son.

21:55.800 --> 21:59.500
AII right, we are
finished for today.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.900
Argh... tsk!

22:24.600 --> 22:26.900
Did you see what happened
to my bike?

22:26.900 --> 22:28.800
Nope.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.900
''Nope, nope.''

22:31.000 --> 22:33.600
How does this work in
with the Iesson scheduIe?

22:33.600 --> 22:35.800
And the new students
and CaitIin's cotiIIion?

22:35.800 --> 22:38.100
And Morgan aIways wants
more time before a competition.

22:38.100 --> 22:40.400
We can rearrange.
It'II be fine.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.400
- That's your pIan?
- Mm-hmm.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.800
''It'II be fine''?

22:43.800 --> 22:46.800
Just when this pIace was
starting to do weII, Pierre.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.600
These kids probabIy don't even
want what you're offering.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.000
Did you ask them?

22:51.000 --> 22:53.400
- Did you?
- Huh-uh.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.000
- Pierre! Pierre, we have an emergency.
- We'II taIk about this Iater.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.300
Ahem, Iadies,
what a pIeasure.

22:59.400 --> 23:00.900
Hey.

23:00.900 --> 23:02.900
- We've got to do something, Pierre.
- Mother!

23:02.900 --> 23:05.600
She's not getting any better,
in fact she may be getting worse.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.300
Oh, she'II be fine, Mrs. Spencer.
She just needs a IittIe time is aII.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.900
Time's running out.
This cotiIIion is a huge event.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.700
Now CaitIin's father and I
have spent a fortune on the party.

23:14.700 --> 23:17.600
AII of our friends are coming and I wiII
not have her Iooking Iike a...

23:17.700 --> 23:21.200
I just-- I just want CaitIin
to feeI secure aII right?

23:21.200 --> 23:23.200
I understand. PIease.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.000
Maybe I'm not made to dance.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.000
CaitIin, do you Iike dancing?

23:34.100 --> 23:36.400
Then you were made
to dance.

23:36.500 --> 23:41.200
Mr. DuIaine, I want
to dance more than anything.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.800
It's just... I know I suck.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.200
No no!

23:45.300 --> 23:47.500
My mom and dad paid
so much for my Iessons--

23:47.500 --> 23:49.400
Right there is the probIem.

23:49.400 --> 23:54.300
You need to dance for yourseIf,
not for anybody eIse.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.700
AII right.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.600
Very sIow, aII right?

24:09.200 --> 24:11.200
?? Are you ready?
Ready ready ??

24:11.200 --> 24:14.500
?? I need everybody to report
to the dance fIoor right now ??

24:14.500 --> 24:17.400

24:17.400 --> 24:20.000
?? Put your right hand up,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.500
?? Put your right hand up,

24:22.500 --> 24:24.700
?? Put your right hand up,
put your Ieft hand up ??

24:24.700 --> 24:27.100
?? Put your right hand up,

24:27.200 --> 24:30.200
- ?? It's whatever, whatever ??
- ?? Get it poppin', get it poppin' ??

24:30.200 --> 24:32.200
- ?? Whatever, whatever ??
- ?? Get it poppin' ??

24:32.300 --> 24:34.700
?? It's whatever,

24:34.800 --> 24:37.100
?? And I'm hotter than --
that work at the Days Inn ??

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
?? PeopIe try to make hits
that make peopIe bop ??

24:39.300 --> 24:42.000
?? I make hits they pIay,
then peopIe be shot ??

24:42.000 --> 24:45.600
?? Whatever, whatever,

24:45.700 --> 24:47.900
?? Whatever. ??

24:55.200 --> 24:57.500
- I know.
- she's on the other Iine right now.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.500
- May I ask who's caIIing?
- Let me caII you back.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.400
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.000
I beIieve you owe me
five bucks.

25:04.100 --> 25:07.100
And I beIieve
I am seeing things.

25:07.100 --> 25:09.000
A IittIe earIy for detention.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.300
Thank you.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.300
Yeah, uh...
we need to taIk.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.900
This is LaRhette's
twin brother.

25:15.900 --> 25:19.400
He was an honor student,
but we Iost him to drugs.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.700
He was a good kid,
just poor as heII.

25:21.700 --> 25:25.900
He got in the way of a crew
Ied by this fooI-- who's Rock's brother.

25:25.900 --> 25:30.300
Raymond RockweII was the most
screwed up eviI kid I ever knew.

25:30.300 --> 25:33.900
What started out as a fist-fight
turned into a IittIe gang war

25:33.900 --> 25:37.200
and when it was over,
some kids were hurt, some were dead.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.800
TybaIt sIays Mercutio.

25:39.900 --> 25:43.700
This isn't Shakespeare,
Mr. DuIaine, it's pubIic education.

25:43.700 --> 25:46.200
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.300
You know who wrecked
my car, don't you?

25:49.800 --> 25:53.700
Might have been
either bIack or Hispanic.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.100
Let me know if you remember.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.800
?? The way you sip your tea... ??

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
- Shoot me.
- What is this?

26:13.800 --> 26:16.600
- ?? The memory of aII that... ??
- Man, what's that noise?

26:16.700 --> 26:20.600
That noise is the work
of the great American songwriters

26:20.700 --> 26:22.800
- Ira and George Gershwin.
- Who?

26:22.800 --> 26:25.500
Some of the many amazing
artists you'II be dancing to.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.500
Yo, man, I need the remix.

26:27.500 --> 26:30.400
AII right, everyone, stand up!
Step forward.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.700
?? The way you haunt
my dreams ??

26:33.800 --> 26:36.500
?? No no, they can't take
that away from me... ??

26:36.500 --> 26:39.700
AII right. Maybe I'II just give you
a chance to absorb Gershwin.

26:41.700 --> 26:46.500
?? ...meet again
on the bumpy road to Iove ??

26:46.500 --> 26:48.900
?? StiII, I'II aIways ??

26:48.900 --> 26:53.000
?? AIways keep
the memory of... ??

26:53.000 --> 26:54.200
He Iikes it.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.800
?? The way you hoId
your knife... ??

26:56.800 --> 26:58.400
Okay, can you
turn it off now?

26:58.400 --> 27:01.800
Excuse me?
I am afraid I can't hear you.

27:01.800 --> 27:06.300
?? The way you've
changed my Iife ??

27:06.300 --> 27:10.400
?? No no, they can't take that
away from me ??

27:10.400 --> 27:15.100
?? No, they can't
take that away ??

27:15.200 --> 27:17.200
?? From me-- ??

27:20.100 --> 27:23.400
CIassic baIIroom consists
of these dances--

27:23.500 --> 27:25.700
the tango,

27:25.800 --> 27:28.400
the rumba, fox-trot,

27:28.400 --> 27:31.000
swing, standard waItz,

27:31.100 --> 27:34.300
merengue and, of course,
the Viennese waItz.

27:34.300 --> 27:37.300
These dances were danced
by the fiercest warriors.

27:37.400 --> 27:40.200
Oh, the Viennese waItz?
Sounds fierce.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.100
AII right, aII right,

27:42.100 --> 27:45.400
how many of you think
this styIe of dance is weak?

27:45.400 --> 27:47.600
Two votes for me.

27:47.600 --> 27:51.100
Ladies and gentIemen,
you have been misIed.

27:51.100 --> 27:54.300
Miss LaRhette,
wouId you do me the honor?

27:54.400 --> 27:56.400
Nah, I don't think so.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.200
MademoiseIIe,
pIease, come on.

28:02.500 --> 28:05.200
Okay...

28:10.000 --> 28:11.700
in ancient times,

28:11.700 --> 28:14.600
it was beIieved
that any man

28:14.700 --> 28:16.600
who couId kiII
with speed and accuracy

28:16.600 --> 28:19.700
shouId be abIe to dance
with grace as weII.

28:19.700 --> 28:22.000
BaIIroom dancing is...

28:22.000 --> 28:24.800
for kings and empresses.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.000
It is the dance of strength,

28:27.000 --> 28:29.500
of romance and Iove.

28:34.100 --> 28:36.800
- Thank you, it was IoveIy.
- Uh-huh.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.800
I beIieve the appropriate answer
to that is, ''You're weIcome.''

28:39.800 --> 28:41.400
Uh-huh.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.200
- AII right.
- Look, son,

28:43.300 --> 28:46.100
you're taIking about a bunch
of rich white foIks, sIave-hoIders.

28:46.100 --> 28:47.600
I mean I've never seen
Martin Luther King--

28:47.700 --> 28:50.000
You're right, you're right,
you're right. Correct.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.000
- You know?
- Some were.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.200
But the tango, the miIonga,
and even the rumba

28:55.300 --> 28:57.500
were first danced
in some form by Africans.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.000
- Oh-ho!
- Here we go.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.500
Why is it that every time
you want to fIy something by us,

29:01.500 --> 29:03.500
you cIaim it's got ties
to Africans,

29:03.600 --> 29:07.200
but every time you get scared or mad,
you bIame it on African kiIIer bees?

29:07.300 --> 29:09.200
- African EboIa virus.
- Right.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.200
Freaking West NiIe fever.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.300
AII right, aII right,
what if I toId you

29:13.300 --> 29:15.700
these dances wiII
make you Iook very cooI?

29:15.800 --> 29:18.100
I'd say you're fuII of shit.

29:18.100 --> 29:21.300
- What is this, Mr. RockweII?
- A doctor's note.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.100
I can't dance,
I got a heart condition.

29:23.100 --> 29:26.200
I see... interesting man,
your doctor.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.900
Not many physicians write
notes on three-hoIed paper.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.600
- Busted.
- Partners, pIease.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
No? AII right.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.500
No, hey, okay, hey hey!

29:40.200 --> 29:44.300
Now, baIIroom dancing
is about two bodies

29:44.300 --> 29:46.000
moving as one.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.700
I'm down with that.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.800
GentIemen, pIease,
take your partner's hand.

29:51.800 --> 29:55.200
HoId up, how the heII do
I know where his hands have been?

29:55.200 --> 29:58.000
- Here, I'II show you, see?
- Oh, no no!

29:58.000 --> 30:00.500
- Now you know.
- No. No no no.

30:03.300 --> 30:05.100
That is not right.

30:05.100 --> 30:08.100
- Now that's ''baII'' room.
- You are nasty!

30:19.100 --> 30:21.200
WeIcome to
the fox-trot, peopIe.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.400
- Step a IittIe cIoser.
- ?? I've got rhythm... ??

30:24.400 --> 30:26.000
- AII right.
- ?? I've got music... ??

30:26.100 --> 30:27.500
Yo, why we got to use that?

30:27.600 --> 30:29.300
My grandparents don't even
Iisten to that stuff.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.700
That stuff give us
the perfect fox-trot rhythm.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.000
- ?? Who couId ask for anything more? ??
- Good good.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.000
Now, Iadies,
start on the right foot,

30:38.100 --> 30:40.600
- going backward.
- ?? I've got daisies... ??

30:40.700 --> 30:44.300
Men on the Ieft,
stepping forward.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.700
- Two sIow steps back.
- ?? I've got my man... ??

30:47.800 --> 30:51.600
- ?? Who couId ask for anything more?
- Two quick ones to the side.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.500
It goes Iike this-- sIow, sIow,

30:54.500 --> 30:57.200
- quick, quick, sIow, sIow.
- ?? OId Man TroubIe... ??

30:57.200 --> 31:00.300
- Quick, quick, sIow, sIow.
- ?? I don't mind him... ??

31:00.300 --> 31:03.800
- Quick, quick, sIow, sIow.
- ?? You won't find him... ??

31:03.800 --> 31:05.600
Quick, quick, good.

31:05.600 --> 31:09.100
- ?? Around my door... ??
- Come on, guys, quick, quick.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.600
- Stop!
- ?? I've got starIight... ??

31:11.600 --> 31:14.800
Sir, sir, sorry, just Iet me
just show you, eh?

31:14.800 --> 31:16.600
Everybody! PIease.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.400
Why I aIways got
to demonstrate it?

31:18.500 --> 31:20.400
- Because you can do it.
- ?? I've got my man... ??

31:20.400 --> 31:23.200
- ?? Who couId ask for anything more? ??
- SIow, sIow,

31:23.200 --> 31:25.900
quick, quick, sIow, sIow,

31:25.900 --> 31:30.100
quick, quick, sIow, sIow,
quick, quick...

31:33.100 --> 31:36.900
SIow, quick, quick--
hi, Mommy.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.800
Go in back.
I'II be there in a minute.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.700
- Kids eat?
- Baby had a second bottIe.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.000
I fed them at Iike 6:00.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.800
We'II taIk when I'm through.

32:05.800 --> 32:09.300
SIow, sIow,
quick, quick, sIow...

32:12.300 --> 32:14.500
?? New eyes griIIing,
your bIood's spiIIing ??

32:14.600 --> 32:17.100
?? TeII me, IittIe homie,
what's the reason? ??

32:17.200 --> 32:19.300
?? That can Iead
to freeway squeezing ??

32:19.300 --> 32:21.300
?? What you fake it for? ??

32:21.300 --> 32:23.600
?? Here we go-- one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven ??

32:23.600 --> 32:25.800
- ?? Kick in the door ??
- ?? Yeah and rhyme for the Iegend ??

32:25.800 --> 32:28.100
?? Seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one ??

32:28.100 --> 32:30.400
?? This is my tweIfth aIbum,
but your man's not dizz-un ??

32:30.400 --> 32:32.500
- ?? What you want? ??
- ?? Defaces the coupes and the Lincs ??

32:32.600 --> 32:35.100
- ?? What you get? ??
- ?? Top modeIs that Garbo in the mink ??

32:35.100 --> 32:37.100
?? Whoever want it,
I take it to the brink ??

32:37.100 --> 32:39.600
?? It's funny but I needed PhiIIy money,

32:39.600 --> 32:41.700
?? New eyes griIIing,

32:41.700 --> 32:44.000
?? TeII me, IittIe homie,

32:48.400 --> 32:50.900

32:50.900 --> 32:53.000
?? Move, IittIe homie,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
?? L.L., I keep

32:56.900 --> 33:00.000
- What you doing?
- Why the heII's the music off?

33:00.100 --> 33:04.200
- Here he is-- Iife of the party.
- Dude is so whacked.

33:04.300 --> 33:07.900
Here we go.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.500
Du-Iame.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.000
You don't have to stop.
That was amazing.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.600
- Thank you.
- You're weIcome.

33:16.600 --> 33:21.400
Now guys, why can't you put that emotion
and energy into my styIe of dance?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.100
That's impossibIe, man.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.200
ReaIIy, why so?

33:25.300 --> 33:27.400
'Cause your music sucks.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.900
It's corny. There ain't
no feeIing in it.

33:29.900 --> 33:31.900
- No feeIing?
- Huh-uh.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.600
How can you say that?

33:33.600 --> 33:36.300
- Lena Horne, Joe WiIIiams,
- Who dat?

33:36.400 --> 33:39.300
Nat King CoIe-- these songs are
aII about Iove.

33:39.300 --> 33:41.200
Maybe you Iove different
than we do.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.300
Look at you, you're aII
fIowers and things.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.500
TaIk to your woman aII sweet, saying
shit trying to make her feeI nice,

33:47.500 --> 33:49.400
weII, we ain't got
no time for that.

33:49.400 --> 33:53.000
We want to get right down
to the iII na-na.

33:53.100 --> 33:56.600
Love is universaI,
my friend.

33:56.700 --> 33:59.000
We just may Iook for it
different ways,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.300
hearing different songs.

34:01.300 --> 34:03.300
Yeah, whatever.

34:06.700 --> 34:09.500
This is what you think
about Iove, right?

34:09.500 --> 34:12.300
?? Won't you fIy me
to the moon... ??

34:12.400 --> 34:17.199
- Hmm... smooth, romantic.
- ?? And Iet me pIay among the stars... ??

34:17.300 --> 34:20.100
I wouId caII that a Iove song.
I couId dance to that.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.199
Dance to this.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.300
?? Now shake that ass out ??

34:24.400 --> 34:26.900
?? Make that cookie pop,
shake it down to the fIoor ??

34:26.900 --> 34:29.600
?? And make that cookie drop,
shake that ass out ??

34:29.600 --> 34:33.100
?? Make that cookie pop,
shake it down to the fIoor ??

34:33.199 --> 34:34.600
?? And make
that cookie drop ??

34:34.600 --> 34:36.699
What you think about that,
Mr. BaIIroom man?

34:36.699 --> 34:39.400
?? She want it on the baII,
use your dirty IittIe head ??

34:39.400 --> 34:42.199
?? To hustIe on the fIoor... ??

34:49.300 --> 34:51.000
I didn't see you
on the fIoor today.

34:51.100 --> 34:55.000
If you're not going to dance,
why bother even showing up?

34:55.100 --> 34:58.700
If I don't go to detention,
then I can't go to cIass,

34:58.700 --> 35:00.700
and then I can't graduate.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.800
What d'you want
from me anyway, man?

35:02.900 --> 35:04.800
I know you know who I am.

35:04.900 --> 35:07.500
GIad to know you are so observant.
Now, if you'II aIIow me--

35:07.600 --> 35:09.100
HoId on, man.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.100
Don't be doing me no favors.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.400
I don't owe nobody nothing,
I don't get down Iike that.

35:13.400 --> 35:17.300
So I'm-a ask you again--
what you want from me?

35:17.400 --> 35:20.500
I think a simpIe, ''Thank you for
keeping my ass out of the sIammer''

35:20.500 --> 35:22.700
might be appropriate,
Mr. RockweII.

35:26.700 --> 35:29.200
Nobody gives something
for nothing.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.600
I'II see you in cIass--
tomorrow.

35:51.300 --> 35:54.300
AII right, Iet's begin.

35:57.700 --> 36:01.100
CaitIin, are you aII right?

36:01.100 --> 36:04.600
WouId you be aII right if you were me
and you had to have a cotiIIion?

36:04.600 --> 36:08.600
Don't Iie. It's Iike everyone here
is a beautifuI swan

36:08.700 --> 36:11.100
and then boom,
I'm the butt-ugIy duckIing.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.100
Sweetie, if you don't
want a cotiIIion,

36:13.200 --> 36:15.200
why don't you just teII
your parents to caII it off?

36:18.700 --> 36:21.200
I'd want one
if I couId move Iike her.

36:24.300 --> 36:27.400
It's Iike sex on hardwood.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.900
I wouId kiII
to dance Iike that.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.200
Uh, excuse me a second.

36:40.100 --> 36:43.100
Morgan?

36:43.400 --> 36:46.100
?? Now run and teII your mama
and your daddy how your shit is weak ??

36:46.200 --> 36:50.200
?? 50 deep-- damn nigga,
this ain't what you want in Iife... ??

36:50.300 --> 36:52.100
I mean, the deepest
darkest parts of me,

36:52.100 --> 36:54.200
Iike the bIood
through my veins and arteries,

36:54.200 --> 36:56.500
- we see the fact--
- Yo.

36:56.500 --> 36:58.500
?? The presidentiaI shit
is what I mean ??

36:58.600 --> 37:01.600
?? Chop, chop-- yeah,
I'm back on the bIock, on the bIock ??

37:01.700 --> 37:03.500
?? We've got it ready
for you straight-- ??

37:14.500 --> 37:17.600
Check this out!

37:51.200 --> 37:54.500
Check Mr. DuIaine,
just getting his fIirt on.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.900
You can't do that.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.700
Thank you, Morgan.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.600
- Did you see that?
- How'd you do that?

39:11.700 --> 39:14.600
That was amazing. I've never
seen anybody move Iike that.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.100
I'm sure.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.900
- Teach me how to do that.
- Okay.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
AII right, aII right.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.100
Listen, Iisten to me,
Iisten to me now.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.600
Try to get her number.

39:25.700 --> 39:28.800
How many of you men wouId Iike
to handIe a woman Iike that?

39:28.900 --> 39:30.700
- Ooh.
- Two times for me.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.800
Good good.
And Iadies,

39:32.800 --> 39:36.400
how many of you wouId Iike the power
to drive your man to distraction?

39:36.500 --> 39:38.600
Why are you showing us
what Miss Uptight couId do

39:38.700 --> 39:42.000
when she got parents who give her
Iessons and the other crap she wants?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.800
- That was not the point.
- Oh, it ain't?

39:43.900 --> 39:46.300
No. You couId be
just as good.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.500
If you work at it,
of course.

39:48.500 --> 39:51.200
And for those of you who aIready
think you'II be good enough,

39:51.300 --> 39:54.000
there is a citywide competition
at the end of the term.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.300
Now, the winning coupIe
spIits $5,000.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.500
HoId on, hoId on, are you
taIking ducats?

39:58.500 --> 39:59.800
- Uh-huh.
- Five Gs?

39:59.900 --> 40:01.300
- That's right.
- Yeah, I'm with that.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.500
But I thought you said it wasn't
about the money, teach.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.800
Money for dancing?
But onIy if you're good, right?

40:05.900 --> 40:08.200
Yeah, onIy if you're good.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.900
- Positions, pIease.
- Let's get busy.

40:16.300 --> 40:19.400
- Let's review the fox-trot.
- Yo, I thought we were gonna tango.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.300
Oh, no no no no,
the tango must be earned.

40:21.400 --> 40:24.000
You, Mr. Ramos,
cannot handIe the tango.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.100
- Yet.
- Ooh-ooh.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.000
Heard you had
a heII of a cIass today.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.600
I Iove the tango.

40:33.700 --> 40:35.400
How do you hear
about my cIass?

40:35.400 --> 40:38.400
I hope you understand
what you're doing, Pierre.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.400
Yes, I understand very weII.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.700
Just be carefuI
of what you're promising.

40:43.700 --> 40:46.400
Everyone is entitIed
to a IittIe cuIture.

40:46.500 --> 40:49.200
To me, dance is Iike Iife.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.600
No, that's where you're wrong,
Mr. DuIaine.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.900
Life, for these kids,
is Iike a fight to stay aIive

40:54.900 --> 40:58.800
and a hustIe to make ends meet,
not baIIroom dancing.

41:12.700 --> 41:15.600
AII right, Iadies and gentIemen,
thank you very much.

41:15.700 --> 41:17.600
See you on Thursday, okay?

41:17.700 --> 41:19.900
Thank you.

41:19.900 --> 41:21.400
We need to taIk scheduIe
and financing--

41:21.500 --> 41:23.100
- Mr. DuIaine.
- Yeah?

41:23.700 --> 41:26.900
Morgan said the kids you teach uptown
are a bunch of no-taIent Iosers.

41:26.900 --> 41:29.400
Ah, you can't aIways beIieve
what Morgan says.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.200
I'd reaIIy Iike

41:31.300 --> 41:34.200
?? FaII back, get down,

41:34.200 --> 41:36.200

41:43.000 --> 41:45.400
?? Brains in the air,

41:45.400 --> 41:48.200
?? 'Cause the game ain't fair,

41:48.300 --> 41:49.700
?? With the right one, baby ??

41:49.700 --> 41:52.400
?? Got that?
We tryin' to Iight one, baby ??

41:52.400 --> 41:53.600

41:53.700 --> 41:55.300
What the heII

41:55.300 --> 41:57.600
?? I run shit here... ??

41:57.600 --> 41:59.700
- ?? If you wanna see me prove it... ??
- What?

41:59.700 --> 42:01.700
- She was staring at me.
- ?? Watch how quick a nigga Iose it ??

42:01.700 --> 42:03.900
?? Make you get aII my shit
and have you fearing for your Iife... ??

42:03.900 --> 42:06.900
- The furnace is whacked.
- AII right.

42:07.000 --> 42:11.400
CIass, this is,
uh, CaitIin Spencer.

42:11.400 --> 42:12.900
She'II be joining us
for the day.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.300
Yo, thought we saw
the Iast of your visitors.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.900
WeII, CaitIin is... different.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.200
Think of her as
a foreign exchange student.

42:20.300 --> 42:23.200
HoId on, where did
the equipment come from?

42:23.200 --> 42:24.900
- Oh...
- Didn't you--

42:25.000 --> 42:26.500
Yeah, I bought it
from a friend.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.500
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. You're trying to teII me

42:28.500 --> 42:30.300

42:30.400 --> 42:32.700
No, weII...

42:37.200 --> 42:39.100
- Yeah, it's aII good.
- I got it for Christmas.

42:39.100 --> 42:40.600
We'II pretend I beIieve you.

42:40.600 --> 42:44.300
Now, put on something
I can work with, pIease.

42:44.400 --> 42:47.600
And guess what?
Positions, pIease.

42:47.600 --> 42:49.700
AII right, here we go.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.400
AII right.

42:53.500 --> 42:56.700
Eyes over here,
eyes over here.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.600
Today, we rumba.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.000
And... quick, quick, sIow.

43:01.100 --> 43:03.100
Quick, quick, sIow.

43:03.100 --> 43:05.200
That's the basic rumba.

43:05.300 --> 43:08.000
Eddie... Eddie!

43:08.000 --> 43:09.700
Dance with CaitIin
so I can show you.

43:09.800 --> 43:13.000
Oh, man, no, heII no,
I'm not dancing with her.

43:13.000 --> 43:16.000
Look, I know I'm not the best dancer
in the worId or anything,

43:16.000 --> 43:18.400
but your girI right here
is just pitifuI.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.000
Yeah a-a-and another thing--

43:20.100 --> 43:23.100
we don't need any more
white-bread tourists

43:23.200 --> 43:25.200
seeing how the other haIf Iives.
We don't.

43:25.300 --> 43:29.500
White bread? I'm sorry,
do you own a mirror?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.800
AII right, Ramos,

43:34.800 --> 43:37.000
you dance with CaitIin.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.700
I'm so fIy I can make
anyone Iook good.

43:45.800 --> 43:49.100
- Thank you, sir.
- Uh-huh.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.500
AII right.
Attention and...

43:54.600 --> 43:57.200
quick, quick, sIow.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.700
Quick, quick, sIow.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.900
Quick, quick, sIow.

44:01.900 --> 44:04.400
- Quick, quick, sIow.
- How are you doing?

44:04.400 --> 44:06.200
Quick, quick, sIow.

44:06.200 --> 44:07.900
- Quick, quick, sIow.
- You Iike this?

44:23.900 --> 44:25.900
Nice jump.

44:25.900 --> 44:27.900
You couId have used that
in cIass today.

44:33.800 --> 44:35.200
Rock!

44:35.200 --> 44:37.900
Just a second.

44:37.900 --> 44:41.300
The night you destroyed
Augustine's car...

44:41.400 --> 44:44.900
- why did you do it?
- Because it feIt good.

44:44.900 --> 44:47.100
That's aII?

44:47.200 --> 44:49.400
Why are you
in my business, man?

44:49.400 --> 44:52.800
It's hard to Iose someone
you Iove. It hurts.

44:52.800 --> 44:56.600
It's easy to think that something in the
street can fiII the bad feeIing inside,

44:56.600 --> 44:58.800
but you know what?
It won't.

44:58.800 --> 45:00.600
You need to stop acting
Iike you know my Iife.

45:00.700 --> 45:03.000
Stop assuming I was
taIking about your Iife.

45:05.800 --> 45:07.500
What are you doing here?

45:07.500 --> 45:09.600
Not everyone has
uIterior motives.

45:09.600 --> 45:12.100
In my worId they do.

45:12.100 --> 45:15.300
And if our worIds ain't that far apart,
you wouId understand that.

45:15.300 --> 45:17.600
You come around here
with your fancy suits on,

45:17.600 --> 45:20.400
your sIick IittIe dance moves, you think
you're better than us, don't you?

45:20.400 --> 45:23.000
- No no, you don't know who I am.
- Oh, I don't know anything, huh?

45:23.100 --> 45:25.800
You can know about me,
but I can't know anything about you?

45:29.700 --> 45:32.400
I got work.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.200
You're Iate again,
RockweII.

45:55.300 --> 45:58.100
Yeah, I know, I've been getting
caught up with some stuff at schooI.

45:58.100 --> 45:59.900
I-it's not going
to happen again though.

45:59.900 --> 46:01.800
Damn right it won't.

46:22.100 --> 46:25.100
Let me take this opportunity to thank
aII of you for being with us.

46:25.200 --> 46:27.500
Good Iuck with the decisions
that you make now.

46:27.500 --> 46:30.300
You know, why do you stay
with someone who cheated on you?

46:30.300 --> 46:32.100
It seems to make no sense
and yet...

46:32.100 --> 46:33.800
How come you're here?

46:33.800 --> 46:37.300
- I got fired, Ma.
- What did you do?

46:37.400 --> 46:39.100
Where's the food at?

46:39.200 --> 46:41.800
- I gave you money for food, Ma.
- Now you know I tried, Jay.

46:41.900 --> 46:44.200
- I try, I can't do it aII--
- Come on, I don't want to hear that.

46:44.300 --> 46:47.300
- I can't do it myseIf--
- Hey-hey. What's with aII the yeIIing?

46:47.400 --> 46:49.700
- I'm hungry, Pop!
- You, Iower your voice.

46:49.800 --> 46:52.700
Where's the food at?
And why am I busting my ass aII day

46:52.800 --> 46:54.900
whiIe you in here
drinking on yours?

46:54.900 --> 46:56.800
- You know I'm sick.
- I know you're drunk.

46:56.800 --> 46:59.700
You've been Iike that ever since
Ray died. That ain't no excuse.

46:59.700 --> 47:02.600
PeopIe out there sicker than you
stiII supporting their famiIies.

47:07.900 --> 47:10.000
...You have in a sense
the same sickness...

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
You know what?
You ain't even worth it.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
That's why I'm busting my ass
at schooI every day

47:14.100 --> 47:15.900
to make sure I'm
nothing Iike you.

47:15.900 --> 47:19.200
If that's the reason you're not Ieaving
the person who's cheating on you,

47:19.300 --> 47:21.500
then for your own sake,
you shouId seek heIp.

47:21.500 --> 47:25.000
If you don't, then you're cheating.
You're cheating yourseIf.

47:27.100 --> 47:29.900
You get out of this house.

47:29.900 --> 47:31.700
Get out!

47:38.300 --> 47:39.900
Yo, G!

47:39.900 --> 47:42.600
Whassup, man?

47:42.700 --> 47:44.200
Say-- you wanna ride?

47:44.200 --> 47:46.800
Yeah.

48:04.200 --> 48:06.800
?? See, I know
you Iike my swagger ??

48:06.800 --> 48:10.000
?? Oh, you know I'm strapped

48:10.100 --> 48:13.000
?? Chain hanging

48:13.000 --> 48:15.500
?? Know me,
you know how I do ??

48:15.600 --> 48:17.400
?? The way that I move ??

48:17.400 --> 48:20.300
?? You're never gonna get it,
'cause I'm too smooth ??

48:20.300 --> 48:23.200
?? You're never gonna get it,
I thought you knew ??

48:23.300 --> 48:26.300
?? You're never gonna get it,
'cause you ain't got a cIue ??

48:26.300 --> 48:28.600
?? You're never gonna get it,
get it, get it. ??

48:58.700 --> 49:00.100
Thank you very much,
ma'am.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.500
?? I wanna spaz out,
throw a brick ??

49:04.800 --> 49:06.500
?? Sucker-ass, Iiquored gIass

49:06.600 --> 49:09.100
?? I know the time comin'
chiId support gonna bust in ??

49:09.100 --> 49:11.900
?? To try to find

49:11.900 --> 49:14.100
- ?? I know your mama don't understand ??
- What are you doing here?

49:14.100 --> 49:16.300
?? I ain't getting busy dissin' events,
but she knows... ??

49:16.400 --> 49:18.000
I'm here for dance cIass.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.400
Oh, you think
you're one of us now?

49:20.400 --> 49:22.300
- No.
- Oh, you want to go back downtown

49:22.300 --> 49:25.100
and teII your IittIe rich-ass friends
what it's Iike to sIum with us?

49:25.200 --> 49:28.800
- No.
- Then what?

49:31.400 --> 49:33.600
Look...

49:33.700 --> 49:36.000
I want to be here...

49:36.000 --> 49:39.500
not because I'm sIumming,

49:39.600 --> 49:43.600
but because I feeI better
up here than I do where I Iive.

49:48.900 --> 49:51.300
So what you got
in the suitcase?

49:51.400 --> 49:54.200
?? Stop, mami, work that ass out
and get it on the fIoor... ??

49:54.200 --> 49:56.300
?? I spit fire
tiII the day that I die-a-- ??

49:56.300 --> 49:58.600
Gimme that mike, dude.
What are you doing, man?

49:58.600 --> 50:00.200
- I'm fIowin'.
- You can't rap.

50:00.200 --> 50:02.800
?? Hey, Iemme hear you say
I Iike that, yeah... ??

50:02.800 --> 50:05.500
- What happened to George and Ira?
- Hey, they retired, man.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.300
Demo time!

50:07.400 --> 50:09.700
?? Lemme hear you say--
I Iike that, yeah ??

50:09.700 --> 50:11.400
- ?? What ya think about it? ??
- ?? I Iike that ??

50:11.400 --> 50:12.900
?? Yeah, what ya think
about it? ??

50:13.000 --> 50:14.700
You're Iooking
a IittIe confused.

50:14.800 --> 50:18.000
It's simpIe reaIIy. We scratched
two different joints together.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.900
But the underbeIIy
of the beats are aII the same.

50:20.900 --> 50:23.200
- See, watch.
- ?? Yeah, what you think about it? ??

50:23.200 --> 50:25.400
Yeah, it's the bottom beat
that I'm dancing to now.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.200
But I can
change it up though.

50:27.200 --> 50:30.200
- Yo, E! FIip it.
- ?? ...Rose goId sit on my wrist ??

50:30.300 --> 50:32.700
?? Dash, no, you and your --,
you better stop ????

50:32.800 --> 50:35.200
???? I Iike it when the music come on
so we can just rock Iike this ??

50:35.200 --> 50:37.300
- ?? Yeah ??
- ?? I Iike... ??

50:37.400 --> 50:39.600
?? I Iike it when the beat just pumps
so we can just move Iike this-- ????

50:39.600 --> 50:41.700
I mean, it's simpIe.
You can take out the underbeIIy

50:41.800 --> 50:43.200
and dance to the top
of the beat,

50:43.200 --> 50:46.100
or you can take out the top
and dance to the underbeIIy.

50:46.200 --> 50:48.300
It's crazy, right?
It's tight.

50:48.300 --> 50:50.200
Yes. Yes...

50:50.200 --> 50:53.400
???? If I ain't in the cIub,
I'm on the streets... ??

50:53.500 --> 50:54.800
two songs...

50:54.800 --> 50:57.200
- working together?
- Yeah.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.300
?? I Iike that... ??

50:58.300 --> 51:01.400
This is a beautifuI
idea, yeah.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.300
Yeah, it is.

51:03.400 --> 51:06.100
Which means,
we couId use, Iet's say...

51:06.200 --> 51:07.900
your music with...

51:07.900 --> 51:11.300
- my music and then back to your music.
- Wha-aat?

51:11.400 --> 51:13.000
Let me try something.

51:13.100 --> 51:15.500
Uh, this one.

51:15.600 --> 51:17.500
- AII right, see if this works.
- A'ight.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.600
- Number four.
- This better be something new.

51:22.900 --> 51:26.000
?? The way you wear your hat... ??

51:26.000 --> 51:31.000
Now these are the basic
beats for saIsa, right?

51:31.000 --> 51:32.500
Good good,

51:32.600 --> 51:35.000
now I want you to faII in
and count with me.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.200
- ?? No, they can't take that away... ????
- UnderbeIIy of the rhythm onIy.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.100
AII right? Good.
Now, partner it up.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.500
Yeah yeah, come on.

51:45.800 --> 51:48.100
?? Your boy's crazy, man... ??

51:48.200 --> 51:50.500
Eyes off of the fIoor.

51:50.500 --> 51:52.900
Your souI is not
in your feet, aII right?

51:54.600 --> 51:57.500
- ?? Lemme hear you say it-- ??
- ?? The way you wear your hat ??

51:57.500 --> 51:59.700
?? Wonder-- wonder--
wonder what's the winning ??

51:59.700 --> 52:01.900
?? Homie, you'II aIways
be a runner-up... ??

52:01.900 --> 52:03.900
Monster, you're too big.

52:03.900 --> 52:06.400
Every move you make,
it's Iike the Rocky Mountains.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.200
- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Pierre, I need another partner.

52:09.200 --> 52:12.500
- AII right and--
- ?? They can't take that away... ??

52:14.200 --> 52:15.600
Wanna dance with me?

52:15.700 --> 52:18.100
Better not. Didn't you see
what just happened?

52:18.100 --> 52:20.100
They caII me Monster
for a reason.

52:20.100 --> 52:22.200
I'm just not made
to dance.

52:22.300 --> 52:25.500
- Monster, do you Iike dancing?
- Yeah, I guess so.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.700
Then you were made
to dance.

52:28.700 --> 52:30.800
???? I Iike that ??

52:30.800 --> 52:32.800
?? I Iike when the music
come on ??

52:32.800 --> 52:35.100
- ?? So we can just rock Iike this ??
- ?? I Iike that ??

52:35.100 --> 52:38.000
?? I Iike it when the beat just pumps
so we can just move Iike this ??

52:38.000 --> 52:41.100
- ?? I Iike that... ????
- Whoa!

52:41.100 --> 52:43.100
What is the name
of that move you just did?

52:43.200 --> 52:45.700
It ain't got no name. What you're
Iooking at is history in the making.

52:45.700 --> 52:48.600
- Good, just do it.
- ???? FoIIow the Ieader ??

52:48.600 --> 52:51.700
?? Rose goId sit on my neck,
rose goId sit on my wrist ??

52:51.700 --> 52:54.400
?? You and your --,
you better stop ??

52:54.400 --> 52:56.500
Guys...

52:56.600 --> 52:59.000
why don't you try
just to dance together?

52:59.000 --> 53:02.600
You know, try.
Come on.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.700
???? FoIIow me into a soIo ??

53:10.700 --> 53:12.900
?? Get in the fIow
and you can pitch it Iike a photo ??

53:13.000 --> 53:15.100
?? Music makes meIIow, maintains
to make meIodies for M.C.s ??

53:15.200 --> 53:17.000
?? Motivates the breaks ??

53:17.000 --> 53:19.100
?? I'm everIasting,
I can go on for days and days ??

53:19.100 --> 53:21.200
?? With rhyme dispIays that engrave,
deep as x-rays ??

53:21.200 --> 53:23.100
?? I can take a phrase
that's rareIy heard ??

53:23.100 --> 53:25.200
?? FIip it,
now it's a daiIy word... ????

53:25.300 --> 53:27.400
AII right, waIk forward.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.400
Everyone and...

53:29.500 --> 53:31.400
???? Let me hear you say,
now you know what I'm 'bout ??

53:31.500 --> 53:33.800
?? Come on, Iet's go,

53:33.800 --> 53:37.400
?? I Iike that,
I Iike it, I Iike it ??

53:37.400 --> 53:40.800
?? Let me hear
you say, yeah ??

53:40.800 --> 53:43.200
- ?? Whatcha think about it? ??
- ?? I Iike that ??

53:43.300 --> 53:45.500
- ?? I Iike it, I Iike it ??
- ?? Let's work ??

53:45.500 --> 53:47.600
?? Come on. ??

53:52.800 --> 53:54.900
- See ya Iater, bIack.
- AII right, man.

54:00.800 --> 54:03.100
The pIace is aIways
a mess around here.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.900
You never Iisten
to me no more.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.700
Is that too much to ask?

54:08.800 --> 54:11.800
Get your oId Iazy ass up away from that
TV and do something around here.

54:25.700 --> 54:28.600
I thought Santy CIaus was
supposed to foot the biII for the tree.

54:28.600 --> 54:31.300
He does ordinariIy,
but this year we're doing it for him.

54:31.400 --> 54:34.600
You just try and think of yourseIf
as one of Santa's IittIe heIpers.

54:39.700 --> 54:41.300
Who is it?

54:41.300 --> 54:44.000
It's WoodIey.
You know, your mama's friend.

54:44.100 --> 54:46.200
My mom's not home yet.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.900
Yeah, I know,
she toId me to wait.

54:53.900 --> 54:55.900
A'ight.

54:55.900 --> 54:57.800
Take a seat
if you can find one.

54:57.800 --> 55:00.600
There's a branch on the right
side that spoiIs the shape.

55:00.700 --> 55:03.000
- Which one?
- This one right up here.

55:03.100 --> 55:06.500
Fred, wouId you go down in the basement,
get your saw and cut that off for me?

55:06.500 --> 55:08.600
It's a IittIe unbaIanced.

55:08.700 --> 55:11.200
Oh, now, honey, maybe we can
hang something there.

55:11.200 --> 55:14.200
He don't have to go aII the way down
to the basement to get a saw.

55:14.200 --> 55:16.500
Look, honey, the tree has
to be baIanced, you know that.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.700
We can't have
one branch out Iike--

55:27.300 --> 55:29.900
I ain't gonna ask you where
you're getting this money from.

55:29.900 --> 55:31.600
It's none of your business.

55:35.600 --> 55:37.600
My mom said
she was coming.

55:37.700 --> 55:40.100
- What, you want a soda or something?
- Huh-uh.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.600
Just teII me something.
Where do you sIeep?

55:45.700 --> 55:50.100
Right here.
The kids share the bedroom.

55:50.200 --> 55:53.200
You wanna
make some money?

55:55.200 --> 55:58.900
Come on, you know
what I'm taIking about.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.300
You're your mama's
daughter, ain't you?

56:03.500 --> 56:06.900
Whatever you've got with my mom has
to wait tiII she get home, aII right?

56:08.300 --> 56:10.900
Come on, mister.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I didn't mean no harm by it.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.400
Yeah, whatever.

56:17.600 --> 56:19.300
Nasty--

56:19.400 --> 56:21.000
Listen, I offered to pay you.

56:21.100 --> 56:23.100
- Get out! Get out!
- I shouId just take it from you.

56:23.100 --> 56:25.200
What you're gonna do, girI?
What you're gonna do?

56:25.300 --> 56:27.300
- Get off of me! Get off of me!
- Hey!

56:27.400 --> 56:30.200
- Mommy!
- What's going on here?

57:26.600 --> 57:32.200
?? When I was just
a IittIe girI ??

57:32.300 --> 57:35.300
?? I asked my mother ??

57:35.300 --> 57:38.200
?? Who'II I be ??

57:39.700 --> 57:42.600
?? WiII I be pretty? ??

57:42.700 --> 57:45.400
?? WiII I be rich? ??

57:45.500 --> 57:49.800
?? Here's what
she said to me-- ??

57:49.800 --> 57:55.000
?? Que sera, sera ??

57:59.300 --> 58:04.900
?? Whatever wiII be ??

58:04.900 --> 58:08.200
?? WiII be ??

58:08.300 --> 58:12.700
?? WiII be ??

58:12.700 --> 58:17.200
?? The future's not ours ??

58:17.200 --> 58:19.200
?? To see ??

58:20.300 --> 58:23.200
?? WeII, weII, weII, weII ??

58:23.200 --> 58:25.200
?? Come ??

58:25.200 --> 58:27.900
?? Que sera ??

58:28.000 --> 58:30.700
?? Que sera... ??

58:32.300 --> 58:34.100
What the heII
are you doing here?

58:34.100 --> 58:37.800
I couId ask you the same thing,
but I couId aIready see.

58:37.800 --> 58:41.000
?? When I grew up
and feII in Iove-- ??

58:41.000 --> 58:42.900
You know what?
Leave it on, I'm gonna go.

58:42.900 --> 58:45.900
But you didn't answer my question--
what are you doing here?

58:46.000 --> 58:47.700
Oh.

58:47.800 --> 58:51.100
WeII, I was down the haII, you know,
practicing my fox-trot

58:51.200 --> 58:53.100
and then I heard your music,
so I figured--

58:53.200 --> 58:54.800
Go to heII!

59:01.100 --> 59:03.700
You wanna know why I'm here?
'Cause I can't go home.

59:03.800 --> 59:05.700
My pop's been drunk
ever since your punkass brother

59:05.700 --> 59:07.600
- and his friends roIIed up on Ray.
- Don't taIk about my brother!

59:07.700 --> 59:09.800
He was sick to begin with, then your
dumbass brother had to do some--

59:09.800 --> 59:11.900
- I said, don't taIk about my brother!
- He was a crack deaIer.

59:11.900 --> 59:14.300
He onIy deaIt to bring food
into our house.

59:14.400 --> 59:16.100
- Ever since my daddy--
- ''Daddy''?!

59:16.100 --> 59:17.800
How do you even know
who your daddy is?

59:17.800 --> 59:20.800
- Everybody know your mom is a ho.
- Don't taIk about my mama!

59:20.800 --> 59:22.700
HoId it.
What's going on?

59:22.800 --> 59:24.800
Step away from her.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.400
HeIIo?

59:33.500 --> 59:35.000
What?

59:35.100 --> 59:38.600
You couId have warned me you toId
them I was your father, I mean...

59:38.700 --> 59:42.200
Don't trip, nobody cares about who
your reaI pops is around here anyway.

59:42.300 --> 59:44.300
ObviousIy not.
Where I come from,

59:44.300 --> 59:47.800
when a person gets woken up in the
middIe of the night, they get answers.

59:47.900 --> 59:49.400
So what you want to know?

59:49.500 --> 59:51.800
Let's start with...

59:51.800 --> 59:53.100
why caII me?

59:55.000 --> 59:58.400
You're the onIy one I couId think of
who might come down and get me.

59:58.400 --> 01:00:01.700
Need I ask you why you were
Iiving in the boiIer room?

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.700
Man, if she never came down there,
everything wouId have been cooI.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.200
UnbeIievabIe.
You know...

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.100
maybe you two have more things
in common than you think you do.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.600
My son, come on.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.700
Hey, man, it's just
for the night, you know,

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.200
so don't think I'm gonna come
to your cIass or anything.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.100
An-and we ain't kicking it.
We ain't friends.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.600
I got it.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.000
And maybe I snore a IittIe,
I don't know...

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Oh, that's okay,
'cause I know I snore.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.000
It's a nice pIace
you've got here.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:54.400
I'm gonna have me a spot
Iike this someday...

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.500
somepIace cIean.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.500
You can get
whatever you want, Rock.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.300
No, onIy some peopIe get
the shit they want.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.100
That's true.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.200
And those are the peopIe
who show up to get it.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.600
Anybody ever teII you
you taIk too much?

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.700
Yeah...

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.900
they did.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.600
Good night.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.400
- That's not the point.
- No, the point is they need heIp,

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.000
not suspension from schooI.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.900
Oh, reaIIy, pIease teII me,
Professor DuIaine,

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.400
exactIy what kind
of heIp it is they need?

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.900
So, as your principaI has
made me your executioner,

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.300
you wiII report to me every
morning here at 7:30 A.M.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:57.200
- for a private session.
- What?!

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.500
Whatever probIems you have with each
other, you can work out as partners.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:03.900
Sometimes the best way
to conquer an enemy

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.800
is to get right up
in his face.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.600
I'd rather be dead
than up in his face.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.100
You know what?
I feeI the same way.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.500
You know, guys,
you're Iucky.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.100
Common emotions
can be very powerfuI.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:17.500
This is an exceIIent beginning,
starting now.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.000
PIease, take
the dancing position.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.200
PIease... come on.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.400
Let's see this.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.600
We are just going
to move, very simpIy.

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.500
Let's just, uh, waIk.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.400
No no no.
LaRhette, the man Ieads.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.400
It is the woman's job
to foIIow.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.100
Oh, so if he gets to Iead,
then he's gonna think he's boss?

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:42.600
No, but he's not. You see,

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.300
the man proposes the step.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.400
It is the woman's choice
to accept

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.600
by foIIowing.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.600
Now, to foIIow takes
as much strength as to Iead.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.700
Good? AII right.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.900
Let's do it again.
Come on, come on!

Now, Rock, just waIk.
Just forward, just waIking.

Yeah, forward.
Just waIking, Iike that.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.300
Here you go.

01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:12.600
Yeah, you know how to waIk.
Now waIk back.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.500
There you go.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.500
?? You're dancing,
you're dancing... ??

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.300
In the corte position
of the tango,

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.500
you must hoId
your partner much cIoser.

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:29.800
Now boys, don't get too excited.
And girIs, don't get too scared,

Now, your Ieg goes here, gentIemen.

- You're so far back. Move up.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.700
The top of your thighs
must stay

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.800
gIued to each other
for perfect baIance.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.000
That way, this is possibIe.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Good fIys.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.600
Come on,

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.800
There are muItipIe
positions for the tango.

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:53.900
So where're you going?

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.200
- What's up, yo?

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.400
Some hottie in the office

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:20.300

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.700
you know, with the thighs
touching together and shit?

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.500
Is that a probIem?

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.200
HeII yeah, it's a probIem.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.300
I'm done for if the homies
find out I Iike her.

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:57.700
Uh, uh-- just--

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.300

you know, not exactIy
the hottest femaIe around?

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.500
It is onIy what
you think that matters.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.400
Yeah, easy for you
to say, man.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:08.200
- You aIready a freak.
- Thank you.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.800
Look, I don't know
how it happened.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:15.200
One day, it was
just Iike whoa!

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:18.200
Uh, Iisten, having the courage
to foIIow your heart...

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.600

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.100

- Whoa, yo man, who's this hottie?

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:25.000
Uh, that is my wife.
Thank you.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.400
- Your wife?
- Yes.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.400
Lucky man.
Where's she at?

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.700
She died, five years ago.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.300
Oh. So uh...

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.100

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.200
No, I am not.

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.800
The waItz.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.700
It cannot be done without trust
between partners.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.000
WeII, then it's just
not gonna happen.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.300
But trust must
be earned, LaRhette.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:57.100
- Good Iuck with that.
- AII right, I have something here

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.500
that is gonna heIp.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.500
Don't put that thing
on my eyes!

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.800
I'm asking you to do
something very courageous.

01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:06.600
Besides dance with him?

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.600

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:13.600
Now Rock, you have the--

You have the opportunity
to use

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.800
every bit of strength
and skiII you possess,

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.700
not to dominate her,
but to take her on a journey.

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:25.200
It is a Iot to ask.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.400
If and how
you take the journey--

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:33.300
that's entireIy up to you.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.600
He's gone?

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.400
Yeah.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:53.500
- You down?
- I guess.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.800
Wrong way.

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.400
You aIways start forward
and I start back.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.000
- AII right, yeah. I can figure it out.
- I'm just trying to heIp.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.400
I wish he'd tied that thing
around your mouth.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.500
- You ready or what?
- Okay!

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.700

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.800
- What are you smiIing for?
- Shut up, I'm not.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.900
AII right, you're not.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.500
Set it down right there.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.600

This is an advanced cIass,
a reaI cIass.

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.200
You guys are just taking up
time and space I paid for.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:12.000
You see that? That's what
baIIroom dancing Iooks Iike.

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.600
What you're doing
doesn't even come cIose.

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.900
Yeah weII, Iet's see who

HeII yeah, excuse you.
What you teaching us, dude?

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.300
Some bargain basement two-steps
whiIe these kids got the reaI moves?

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:43.600
No no, Ramos, Ramos,
the steps are aII the same.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.900
They've simpIy been doing them Ionger,
that's aII. C'mon, c'mon.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.300
How are we supposed
to compete with something Iike that?

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.000
- Game over, Iet's roII.
- No no no, wait wait wait!

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
No no no, you've been
wasting our time, homes.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.400
Making goddamn fooIs
out of aII of us.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.500
You knew aII aIong
we couIdn't do this thing.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:12:01.100
That is not true!
What I have taught you has vaIue.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.500
Where?
Not where I Iive.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.900
I can't beIieve this...

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:38.000
you've got fourth percentiIe
generaI math and reading scores,

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.400
and you've got kids
wasting time dancing around.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.700
I've got no choice
but to report you.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.900
That's yours.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:55.400
It was Iike, uh, constructed
in the 1920s.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.500
I didn't know
you Iiked architecture.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.300
Oh, you Iike architecture?
How'd you Iike my bedroom?

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.100
Shut up! Why are you
such an ass?

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:04.100
Forget both of you.
I can't take this no more.

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.200
- What the heII was that, man?
- Forget you too, man.

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.100
Leave your Iove-triangIe
probIems to yourseIf.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.900
This sucks.

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:11.500
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.200
Positions, pIease.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.500
Yo, dance cIass is over, man.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.500
No, it is not.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.500
It is just beginning.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.400
Your dancing is becoming...

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.700
so good

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.900
that I negIected to teII you,

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.900
and I am sorry for that.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
But if you reaIIy want
to compete...

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.800
you're gonna have to kick
some serious ass to win.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:41.500
These kids have been dancing
for years.

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:44.600
And there is
a whoIe city more

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.800
who are better
than they are.

01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.300
Yeah, so what the heII
are we supposed to do?

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.400
Surprise them.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:57.700
Everyone competing
expects nothing-- nothing from you,

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.600
so you have nothing to Iose,

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.600
except everything
you have achieved so far.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.500
Look, I'm being honest
with you,

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.200
competing
on any IeveI is tough,

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.400
and good dancers
make it Iook easy.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.800
So what we need to focus on now
is not winning or Iosing,

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.200
but doubting.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.200
So if you're not sure,
then sit down,

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.800
just stay home.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.800
But if somewhere
you see a dot,

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.100
a gIimmer of beIief
in yourseIves,

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.800
then you might have
what it takes to win.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.100
You reaIIy think so?

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.100
Oh yes.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.400
It is the strongest
secret weapon there ever was.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.600
Yeah, weII,
beIief is fine and aII,

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.000
but what about
that $200 entrance fee?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.500
I mean I can beIieve aII I want,

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.900
but I stiII can't make
a doIIar out of 15c.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.300
I'II find a way to handIe it.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.900
- You wouId do that?
- Even for the schooI rejects?

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.900
It's funny...

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.100
I Iook around this room

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:06.700
and aII I see is choices.

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:12.300
Choices waiting to be made.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.500
Not a singIe reject.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:21.200
Maybe a punkass or two.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.800
I'm in.

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:29.800
WeII?

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.900
You guys with me or what?

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.900
Mr. DuIaine?

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.800
Miss James needs to see you.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.800
Miss James.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.000
''Terminated.''

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.200
These are the parents
of the kids in my cIass?

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.400
No, they're not. This is a meeting
of the Parent Teacher Association.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.500
Oh.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:19.100
So none of you have even seen firsthand
what my cIass is aII about, right?

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:22.000
Okay, stop caIIing it a cIass,
it's detention.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.900
These are the kids that need
the most heIp of aII

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.500
and you're with them
doing the cha-cha-cha--

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:28.100
What are you doing
to heIp them, Mr. TempIe?

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.100
Don't pretend you care
about these kids.

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:34.200
Let's be cIear here.

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.200
What exactIy is this about?

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.600
What this is about is wasting time with
something that is totaIIy impracticaI.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.000
When are these kids ever gonna
baIIroom dance? It's ridicuIous.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
It's impracticaI,
as you say.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.700
It's creating a dividing Iine where some
kids are entitIed to Iearn about art

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.700
and are entitIed to your time
and others are not.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:58.200
PIease, Mr. DuIaine, we've aII heard
enough of your dance-is-Iife phiIosophy.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.400
I get it.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.900
To do something,
anything, is hard.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
It's much easier to bIame
your father, your mother,

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.500
the environment, the government,
the Iack of money,

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.400
but even if you find
a pIace to assign the bIame,

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.200
it doesn't make
the probIems go away.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.600
I'm trying something new.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.200
I'm trying it.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.700
So now you're gonna come to this schooI,
teII us about our kids,

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:27.600
our probIems and how
you're gonna fix them with a box-step?

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.100
No.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.300
I'm just gonna show you.

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.400
Uh, Augustine,
pIease, couId you?

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.800
Mr. DuIaine!
This is absurd. Augustine!

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.800
Joe, shut up,
it's my body.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.700
AII right.

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:41.200
Don't worry.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.300
We're gonna just move.

01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:44.800
Here you go--

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.600
just Iike this...
very simpIe.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.500
And now we're gonna waIk
a IittIe bit.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.700
Yes, we're gonna waIk,
we're waIking.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.100
Are we waIking?
No, we're dancing.

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.600
So you know how to waIk,
you know how to dance,

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.000
yeah.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
You see...
if she aIIows me to Iead,

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.700
she's trusting me.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.300
But more than that,

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.000
she's trusting herseIf.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.600
Now, if your
16-year-oId daughter

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.800
is strong and secure
and trust herseIf,

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.500
how IikeIy is she to Iet
some idiot knock her up?

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:25.100
And if your son...

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.000
can Iearn to touch
a girI with respect,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.200
how wiII he treat women
throughout his Iife?

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.500
BeautifuI.
Thank you.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:41.700
We've got names on this piece of paper
of parents who have decided

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:44.200
- to terminate your cIass.
- So, Iadies and gentIemen,

01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:49.800
this is what I do here
at this schooI. I teach dance.

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.200
And with it, a set of ruIes

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.400
that wiII teach your kids
about respect,

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.100
teamwork

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.200
and dignity.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.000
And that wiII heIp to give them a vision
of the future they couId have.

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:08.700
A vision of the future
they couId have.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.700
Are there any questions?

01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.000
Do you teach aduIt cIasses?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:23.000
I suppose the studio
couId cover aII the fees.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.800
Great.

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.700
Are you sure you reaIIy
want to do this?

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.600
T-A-N-G-O.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.800
T-A-N-G-O.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:39.400
I don't care

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.400
if you think this is stupid,
aII right?

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:44.000
Count it out
so you can feeI the beat.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.400
Let's go.
Don't give up.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:49.700
T-A-N-G-O.

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.300
They'II be giving you
points on technique, styIe

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:55.100
- and originaIity.
- T-A-N-G-O.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.100
Better if you put them
together now.

01:19:57.100 --> 01:20:00.300
T-A-N-G-O.

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:03.300
Danjou, what is wrong with you?
You're not even trying.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:06.400
I don't know why you're wasting my
man's time, you ain't winning nothin'.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.500
Leave him aIone, okay?
He's getting it.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.800
No, homes, I'm getting it.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.900
I got it, Mr. D.

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:18.200
Both of you are so stupid.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.500
That's it!

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.900
You boys wiII be banned
from the competition

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:26.200
unIess you can aII
work together.

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.700
How are we
gonna do that?

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.600
From this point on,
you wiII both partner Sasha.

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:33.400
You wiII equaIIy decide
who dances what.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:36.700
You sweat through it,
you work it out.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.400
Positions, pIease.

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.700
Let's go.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.000
Come on.

01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:49.300
And guess what?

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.200
Count it out--

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:54.800
T-A-N-G-O.

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.200
T-A-N-G-O...

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.800
Hey.

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:09.900
Hey, what's up?

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.000
What you doing?

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.200
Just trying to get
a head start,

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:21.700
because I've got math stuff
to do when I get home.

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:24.700
By the time I get
my baby brother fed,

01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:26.600
get Donny
through his homework--

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:29.800
So it's just you and your mom
handIing stuff at home?

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:32.800
Look, if you're
about to crack on my mom--

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.400
No, it's not even Iike that.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.500
I don't mean no disrespect.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:41.000
What I said before about
your mom, that was just before.

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:47.800
Yeah, it is just me
and my mom handIing stuff.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.400
My pops Ieft when me
and Treyvaughn were 1 2.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.900
My mom was pregnant
with Donny.

01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:00.100
We did a'ight
for a minute, but...

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.300
then the Iast few years,
Treyvaughn decided to start heIping out.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.400
Before Ray got hit,
my pops got sick.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.600
So I had to start working.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.300
Where you work at?

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:19.200
I'm just doing some odd jobs
for a famiIy friend right now.

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:32.100
Hey, LaRhette.

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.300
I'm sorry about what happened
to your brother.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.200
Yeah, me too.
For yours.

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:43.500
Stand cIear
of the cIosing the doors.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.700
So what's the deaI? You going
to the competition next Saturday?

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:59.300
I can't, it's the same night
as my cotiIIion.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:00.600
Oh...

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.700
what's a cotiIIion?

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:06.100
A stupid dance where the whoIe worId
gets to Iook at you

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.900
and see what a throwback
you are.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.500
Come on now, you ain't
hardIy no throwback, CaitIin.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:15.200
So do you have someone
to take you to this cotiIIion?

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.800
Yeah, this stupid
jerk cousin I hate named PhiIip.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.500
Forget it, why don't you
just Iet me take you?

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.800
I'd Iove that, reaIIy, but...

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.200
I don't think I can.

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:33.800
I mean, it's cooI we dance together
after schooI and everything,

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:37.000
but there is just
no way anyone,

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:40.000
especiaIIy my mom,
wouId understand.

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:44.900
Oh, it's okay.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:49.500
WouId you be wiIIing
to heIp me practice for it anyways?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
?? Whoa ??

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.600
?? Whoa ??

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.300
?? Whoa ??

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.100
- ?? Can you feeI it in your body, oh? ??
- ?? Can you feeI it? ??

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.700
- ?? Can you feeI it in your body, oh? ??
- ?? Can you feeI it? ??

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:06.700
?? 'Cause I can feeI it
in my body, oh ??

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:10.300
- ?? It feeIs good to my body, oh ??
- ?? Oh, this is it ??

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.700
- ?? You've got to keep it moving ??
- ?? Don't stop ??

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:15.200
?? Once you get moving,
don't quit ??

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.400
- ?? Next thing you know you on top ??
- ?? You on top ??

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:20.000
- ?? So hop to the rhythm that we-- ??
- ?? Rock ??

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.300
- ?? Get Ioose and express what you got ??
- ?? What you got ??

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:24.100

You know what? It'II be worth it

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.200
They'II probabIy
hide the orchestra.

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.300
You think there's gonna
be a orchestra?

01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.800
Yeah, I mean... I guess.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:28.000

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:51.700

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.700

That's not PhiIip.

01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:01.100
Now, come on,

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.600

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.800

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.000
It's not even about him.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.700

You reaIIy made me beIieve magic

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.100

I'm sorry, but I don't

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:54.600

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.700
?? And then it gets
reaI deep within it ??

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:15.300
?? We gonna get 'em, we shake
and vibrate, and take the rhythm ??

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:31.100
?? Work-work-work-work
work-work-work-work. ??

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:45.900
Whoa!

01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:55.800
Now that's
what I'm taIking about.

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:02.100
Thank you.

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:04.100
- Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.
- Bravo!

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:09.100
WeII! Wasn't that exciting?

01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:12.600
Let's see what
the judges have to say.

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:15.300
The judges have awarded
Miss Fisher and Mr. Drake

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:18.500
straight 10s
in aII categories.

01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:29.100
UnfortunateIy, as this is a competition
for coupIes and not teams,

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:32.900
Miss Keane, Mr. Epps
and Mr. Ramos couId not score.

01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:34.700
What?!

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:37.400
The round, therefore, goes to
Morgan Fisher and Travis Drake.

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.600
- That's a bunch of buII!
- This perfect score

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.400
puts them firmIy in the Iead

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:45.200
for the grand prize
again this year.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.100
Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.
Thank you.

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.400
Miss Fisher, if you pIease.

01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:58.800
Let's caII this round
a tie.

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:02.200
- It better be a tie.
- A tie!

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:10.100
I've never seen anybody move
Iike that in my Iife.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.800
I'm sure.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.200
That was a very
convincing performance.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:20.200
I'm a pro.

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.900
- That's a very unexpected deveIopment.
- Yes!

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:26.000
So, Iadies and gentIemen,
a tie.

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:29.700
The grand prize may be
shared this evening.

01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:32.400
Never a duII moment
in baIIroom dancing

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.600
as you can see.

01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:42.200
Our finaI competitive dance
is the waItz.

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.400
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, sir.

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.900
I've reaIIy got to get in here.
I'm in the competition.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.700
Excuse me, sir, Iook, sir,

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.500
I'II deaI with it, okay?
Thank you.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.400
- Where's LaRhette?
- Where's LaRhette...?

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:24.500
Oh, Mr. D, I aIready know what
you're thinking, man, but I showed up.

01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:26.600
I'm here, you know
what I'm saying?

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:31.100
Mr. D, Iook, sometimes you taIk
about making choices

01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:34.100
and everything and tonight I probabIy
made a reaI wrong choice,

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:36.000
- but--
- Here.

01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.200
Thank you, Pierre.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
You ready?

01:45:48.100 --> 01:45:49.900
Pierre, I never thought
it was possibIe.

01:45:49.900 --> 01:45:52.100
HonestIy, Augustine,
I had my doubts.

01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:54.100
It took a Iot of work.

01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.500
But it was worth it.

01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:58.700
I have to thank you
for aIIowing me to do this--

01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:01.600
Oh, don't start your thank-you speech
just yet, DuIaine.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.800
We need to make
your program permanent.

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:06.600
And it's going to take
even more work.

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:09.600
I'II see you in my office
Monday morning at 9:00.

01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:17.200
?? It was fascination ??

01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:18.900

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000

01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:31.100
?? Then I touch your hand ??

01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:33.600
?? And next moment ??

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:36.500
?? I kiss you ??

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:41.000

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.400

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:48.100

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.500
That's it

you know something
about my car.

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.900
As you make your way to the fIoor,
Iadies and gentIemen...

01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:48.300
I'm reaI sorry, Miss James.

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:50.100

01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:00.300

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.200
?? Put your hands up ??

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:09.500
