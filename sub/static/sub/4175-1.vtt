WEBVTT

01:02.012 --> 01:04.890
Another bad dream, baby?

01:05.516 --> 01:07.518
Just go back to sleep.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.049
Yes!

01:41.135 --> 01:43.220
Travis.

01:44.638 --> 01:48.725
- Hey, what's up, Max?
- Can I... talk to you for a minute?

01:49.393 --> 01:51.937
Yeah, okay.

01:52.771 --> 01:57.484
All right, up and at them, ladies.
Up and at them!

01:57.985 --> 02:00.112
Oh, God!

02:01.572 --> 02:03.657
Sorry.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.284
What are you doing here?

02:05.576 --> 02:08.370
What do you mean?
My first threesome. I owned it.

02:08.495 --> 02:11.915
Actually it was a little more work
than I thought it was gonna be.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.375
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.336
But what did I say
about using my place for sex?

02:16.420 --> 02:19.423
- I don't know.
- I said use your own place.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.135
And risk having these chicks know where
I live? I mean, you know I can't do that.

02:23.260 --> 02:24.845
Yea, but Evelyn slept over, man.

02:24.970 --> 02:27.764
If she knows you are here
she is gonna shit a Prius!

02:27.848 --> 02:31.268
Come on, this should be cool with you.
We're brothers.

02:31.393 --> 02:33.937
Half brothers technically.

02:34.062 --> 02:37.941
From the same sac.
I can't believe you would say that.

02:38.317 --> 02:40.736
I'm disappointed in you.

02:40.861 --> 02:44.448
How do you get these girls
to bang you, I will never know.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.868
You see, it's not about banging.
It's about love.

02:47.993 --> 02:52.414
I love these girls with everything I got.
I care about Leikeidra and Lashanda.

02:52.539 --> 02:55.292
I care about them so much.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.045
No, no, not... not from the bottle.

03:00.214 --> 03:04.802
- Sorry, I lost electrolytes back there.
- Oh, great. Now would you please go?

03:06.595 --> 03:08.972
Just keep your voice down.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.308
- Where are the eggs?
- What eggs?

03:11.391 --> 03:14.478
The eggs. I always down one raw egg
after busting a night,

03:14.603 --> 03:18.816
and right now I need three.
Make that four raw eggs, stat.

03:20.317 --> 03:24.071
I don't know. Evelyn doesn't let me
have any food that's not vegan.

03:24.154 --> 03:26.740
So, you're saying you got no eggs?

03:27.825 --> 03:29.618
Oh, my God.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.829
When are you gonna nad up to this broad?

03:31.912 --> 03:34.581
I mean, first she makes you to sell
your car because it wasn't a hybrid,

03:34.706 --> 03:36.583
now she is screwing with your diet?

03:36.708 --> 03:41.880
Yeah, well, when you meet a girl
that's half as hot and intelligent

03:42.005 --> 03:45.217
and concerned about
the environment as Evelyn,

03:45.342 --> 03:47.386
- we will talk.
- I don't... think I want that.

03:47.511 --> 03:49.805
- Yo!
- Oh, shit!

03:49.888 --> 03:54.768
Hey! Mary-Kate, Ashley, get your stuff
and whatever is left of your dignity

03:54.852 --> 03:57.521
out of the apartment, please. Thank you!

03:57.604 --> 03:59.857
- Travis?
- Hey, how are you?

03:59.940 --> 04:02.734
- You can go to hell.
- Yes, yes, ma'am.

04:02.860 --> 04:04.736
Come on! Chop-chop ladies. Let's go.

04:04.862 --> 04:08.198
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

04:08.282 --> 04:11.952
I suggest go to the nearest church
or Planned Parenthood.

04:12.703 --> 04:15.372
- Is that...
- I think you should probably wash this.

04:15.497 --> 04:17.875
- Is that my sheet?
- It's not mine.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.043
Just... just take it with you.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.880
Hey, whatever happens,
I'm here for you, brother.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.799
He is your half brother. Half!

04:27.050 --> 04:29.970
That was a little harsh,
don't you think, Ev?

04:30.053 --> 04:34.308
No. I'm only trying to help him. Okay?

04:34.391 --> 04:37.436
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

04:37.561 --> 04:39.563
It's okay.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.107
But you can make it up to me.

04:42.858 --> 04:47.112
You know. Little bit of...
breakfast sex.

04:47.446 --> 04:49.740
I'm already late for work as it is.

04:49.865 --> 04:53.410
Then you have nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

04:54.787 --> 04:57.998
All right, okay. Alright,
but it's gotta be a quickie.

04:58.123 --> 05:00.167
Who said it was going to take long?

05:49.133 --> 05:51.844
Who dare call Bloody Mary's?

05:51.927 --> 05:53.554
Hi, Mary.

05:53.679 --> 05:59.309
Yeah, I'm here. I'm sorry I'm late.
Something... came up.

06:00.144 --> 06:05.649
Yup, I'm gonna dress the windows right now
and then I will clean the bathrooms.

06:05.774 --> 06:09.820
- <i>You better.</i>
- Okay, bye-bye.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.030
Delivery!

06:12.656 --> 06:14.908
Ghoul morning, Chuck.

06:15.951 --> 06:18.704
I can't believe your boss
makes you greet people that way.

06:18.829 --> 06:21.290
Yeah, she says it adds to the ambience.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.960
My condolences. Sign that.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.171
Tell you what, though,
when I own my own shop,

06:27.254 --> 06:29.339
I'm going to greet the customers
the way I want to.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.842
Hey, that'll be the day.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.219
Thanks.

06:34.344 --> 06:36.096
And the last one.

06:36.180 --> 06:38.765
All right. Thank you, Chuck,
and go to hell.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.019
You're welcome and go to hell, Max.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.466
I didn't order you.

07:18.889 --> 07:20.933
Satan genie.

07:21.350 --> 07:26.939
"Make any want, wish
or desire yours, the evil way."

07:35.405 --> 07:38.742
Live Green or Blog Hard.
Saving the world, one blog at a time.

07:38.867 --> 07:42.079
I just got a shipping of costumes.
You wanna play dress up?

07:42.162 --> 07:46.583
- <i>That depends on what you got.</i>
- Well, there is naughty nurse,

07:46.667 --> 07:51.421
mischievous maid, slutty schoolgirl
and hussy housewife.

07:51.922 --> 07:54.007
My favorites.

07:54.758 --> 07:59.930
Let me just finish up this blog
and I will be there in a jiff.

08:12.484 --> 08:16.113
That was fang-tastic.

08:27.207 --> 08:31.044
Your boss needs to replace these
incandescent tubes with compact fluorescents.

08:31.253 --> 08:32.962
CFLs last up to ten times longer

08:33.087 --> 08:36.467
and she'll be cutting
her energy bill by more than half.

08:37.134 --> 08:40.471
I love it when you speak green.

08:40.596 --> 08:45.350
Well, I'm just trying to...
curb your carbon footprint.

08:45.893 --> 08:51.773
So when I open Max's Scare Shack,
you can be my environmental consultant.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.485
Okay, here we go again with that.

08:54.610 --> 08:57.237
- Ev...
- Look...

08:57.321 --> 09:00.532
werewolves and vampires
and zombies, they are figments.

09:00.616 --> 09:03.410
- Max, they're not real.
- And?

09:03.577 --> 09:05.412
And why waste your time,
hawking this crap

09:05.496 --> 09:09.374
when there are so many
real problems in the world.

09:09.666 --> 09:12.586
And look at this, okay?

09:13.420 --> 09:15.714
Satan genie.

09:15.839 --> 09:21.136
"Make any want, wish
or desire yours, the evil way."

09:21.261 --> 09:23.347
It's a load of horseshit.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.016
Yeah, but that's why this stuff
is so important.

09:26.099 --> 09:30.270
It challenges us to stop accepting
the world and you know,

09:30.395 --> 09:36.068
face our inner monster
and find the strength to conquer it.

09:36.819 --> 09:41.406
- It's a bit of a stretch, Max.
- Yeah, well, you say that now,

09:41.532 --> 09:47.579
but who will you turn to when the world
is taken over by zombies?

09:51.125 --> 09:53.836
You make me laugh.

09:53.919 --> 09:56.797
Glad to be of service.

09:57.214 --> 09:59.216
Serious.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.388
Once I lost my mom,

10:05.514 --> 10:08.308
a part of me just shut off.

10:08.392 --> 10:12.146
Like a piece of me died with her and...

10:12.813 --> 10:15.274
and I found you.

10:15.607 --> 10:18.110
You brought me back to life.

10:18.735 --> 10:21.780
Promise me we'll always be like this.

10:21.864 --> 10:25.325
I promise we will always be together.

10:25.409 --> 10:28.203
Always and forever.

10:49.391 --> 10:53.645
Well, welcome to your new home.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.400
Our new home.

11:04.239 --> 11:05.824
Lugosi did kick the habit,

11:05.949 --> 11:09.495
but I think there's a YouTube video
of him leaving rehab. Which is great.

11:09.620 --> 11:12.581
Yeah, that's great, but that's why
you should never put anything unnatural

11:12.706 --> 11:15.417
into your body, Max.
I just wrote a blog about this.

11:15.501 --> 11:18.796
I feel like a malted.
Do you want a malted?

11:18.921 --> 11:24.426
- Max, you know I don't drink milk.
- Come on, Ev. Live a little.

11:24.510 --> 11:26.553
This stuff in that kills you.

11:40.108 --> 11:41.693
Oh, my God.

11:41.777 --> 11:44.363
Hello. Welcome to Ice Cream.

11:44.488 --> 11:47.157
Look at all these flavors, Ev.

11:47.241 --> 11:51.662
Everything's home made by yours truly
and everything truly kicks ass.

11:52.246 --> 11:55.833
Ginger Gore, Walnut Warlock,

11:55.916 --> 11:58.252
Caramel Cadaver.

11:58.377 --> 12:00.671
- Wait a second, Fruit Brute?
- Yeah.

12:00.838 --> 12:05.425
- Like the monster cereal Fruit Brute?
- Yeah, like the monster cereal.

12:05.509 --> 12:09.012
- What's a Fruit Brute?
- General Mills put out a...

12:09.096 --> 12:12.057
Sorry, please, go ahead.

12:12.141 --> 12:15.185
They put out a line of cereals
based on classic monsters

12:15.269 --> 12:18.147
like Franken Berry, Boo Berry,
Count Chocula

12:18.272 --> 12:23.068
and Fruit Brute was one of the cereals
but no one bought it so it died.

12:23.193 --> 12:26.530
Yeah, until I decided
to resurrect it. It's alive.

12:26.655 --> 12:28.198
How, retro!

12:28.282 --> 12:30.993
I will have one Fruit Brute
malted, please.

12:31.076 --> 12:34.288
Excellent choice. And for the lady?

12:34.371 --> 12:37.791
I'll take a Soy Oreo shake
and we're in rush.

12:37.875 --> 12:42.045
Actually I don't have cookies and cream.
You know you can get that anywhere, so...

12:43.630 --> 12:46.467
I've never met an ice cream snob before.

12:46.550 --> 12:49.470
- Stop, Evelyn.
- I didn't mean it like that at all.

12:49.595 --> 12:51.763
Oh, no, you think
that you're so great, right?

12:51.889 --> 12:55.225
Because you work at some novelty
ice cream shop where you serve flavors

12:55.309 --> 12:58.312
based on pop culture artifacts
that only cool people like you know about,

12:58.395 --> 13:00.814
but do you actually know
what they put in this stuff?

13:00.898 --> 13:03.984
You're practically poisoning
your customers.

13:04.067 --> 13:05.736
What is your problem?

13:05.819 --> 13:08.530
- You are my problem, skank!
- Evelyn!

13:08.614 --> 13:12.659
No, Max. We're leaving.
We are going to Pinkberry.

13:13.660 --> 13:17.581
- Are you coming or not?
- But Fruit Brute!

13:18.415 --> 13:19.458
Fine.

13:23.420 --> 13:25.005
I'm so sorry.

13:25.297 --> 13:29.593
That's fine, no worries. Good luck!

13:30.385 --> 13:34.681
Enjoy Pinkberry. Has milk in it... also.

13:41.271 --> 13:43.690
You mind telling me what that was about?

13:43.816 --> 13:46.527
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me, Flirty McGee?

13:46.652 --> 13:51.073
Flirty McGee? We were talking
about monster cereals.

13:51.323 --> 13:56.286
Fine, go be with someone who knows about
obscure discontinued breakfast foods, Max.

13:56.411 --> 13:59.039
I just wanted a malted!

14:06.880 --> 14:09.758
Max, I'm so sorry.

14:10.384 --> 14:12.553
Please don't be mad at me.

14:12.678 --> 14:14.805
I'm not mad,

14:14.930 --> 14:18.308
I just want to know
what happened back there.

14:18.392 --> 14:20.686
I don't know, I just...

14:20.811 --> 14:25.065
I freaked out, you know?
It wasn't you, it was... that girl.

14:25.149 --> 14:27.860
She just got under my skin.

14:27.985 --> 14:31.738
It was just ice cream, Evelyn.
Ice cream.

14:33.115 --> 14:36.410
You're right. I'm sorry. I am.

14:37.327 --> 14:39.580
I just get scared sometimes.

14:40.539 --> 14:43.542
You're all I have
and I don't want to lose you.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.794
You're not gonna lose me, Ev.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.840
Okay.

14:59.016 --> 15:02.769
- Thank you. Go to hell.
- Where do you get off?

15:08.901 --> 15:11.987
- Who dare call Bloody Mary's?
- <i>Hey, sexy.</i>

15:12.404 --> 15:15.532
You think you can sneak away from work
for a minute? I have a surprise for you.

15:15.699 --> 15:18.327
<i>I promise you won't regret it.</i>

15:18.452 --> 15:21.205
- Really?
- Really.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.875
On my way.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.883
Surprise!

15:47.064 --> 15:52.402
Max, not on the runner. It's hypoallergenic
and I would like to keep it that way.

15:53.070 --> 15:54.363
My bad.

15:58.200 --> 16:02.287
So, do you love it or do you love it?

16:02.412 --> 16:05.415
Yeah. It's... it's different.

16:05.499 --> 16:09.169
Our apartment is now 100 percent green.

16:09.294 --> 16:11.421
Literally.

16:11.505 --> 16:14.299
Do you like the color?
It's made from fresh cut wheat grass

16:14.424 --> 16:18.095
so no solvents, toxic metals
or volatile organic compounds.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.430
Great.

16:20.514 --> 16:23.225
What did you do with my posters?

16:23.350 --> 16:26.019
Don't worry, I put them in the drawer.

16:26.145 --> 16:29.231
Oh, my God! You're kidding me, right?

16:36.738 --> 16:38.198
You ruined them.

16:38.323 --> 16:40.617
Max, please!
They weren't even in English.

16:41.326 --> 16:43.787
That's because they were imported.

16:43.912 --> 16:46.498
Okay, well, they were
taking up all the wall space.

16:46.623 --> 16:50.377
These were in pristine condition.

16:50.794 --> 16:53.297
Do you understand
how much these were worth?

16:53.422 --> 16:55.757
I was going to make a down payment
on a space with these.

16:55.883 --> 16:57.176
There you go with the shop idea...

16:57.301 --> 16:59.720
And when did we decide to redecorate
the apartment anyway?

16:59.803 --> 17:02.598
- Okay, well, it's my home too.
- I know Evelyn, I know,

17:02.723 --> 17:05.142
but we have to make these sorts
of decisions together.

17:05.267 --> 17:09.688
Well, it was my mother's birthday and
I was just trying to do something fun.

17:11.482 --> 17:13.483
Evelyn.

17:13.567 --> 17:16.904
- Just leave me alone, Max.
- Ev...

17:17.654 --> 17:20.156
Come on.

17:20.782 --> 17:23.911
- Ev...
- Go away!

17:48.185 --> 17:50.896
<i>Travis no estoy aquÃ­.</i>

17:50.979 --> 17:52.773
I said "<i>no tengo la rento</i>."

17:52.856 --> 17:55.776
Travis, open up. It's me.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.950
Come on.

18:07.579 --> 18:10.249
Jesus, man. You look like shit.

18:10.374 --> 18:11.750
Yeah, well...

18:11.875 --> 18:14.920
ever since Little Miss Boner-killer
banned me from your apartment,

18:15.003 --> 18:19.174
I haven't been able to get any poon.
I'm all backed up.

18:20.342 --> 18:22.970
You look pretty busted yourself.
Hasn't she been feeding you?

18:23.053 --> 18:25.973
Tofu, tofu, tofu.

18:26.056 --> 18:28.809
All tofu. All the time.

18:28.892 --> 18:32.479
- Yuck!
- I know, I know. I skip most meals.

18:32.604 --> 18:35.816
Not that, I think
this Twinkie is expired.

18:35.899 --> 18:39.903
- Twinkies don't expire.
- Yeah, they do. Every four weeks.

18:40.028 --> 18:42.239
- Really?
- Then they get good again.

18:43.407 --> 18:45.451
I did not know that.

18:47.077 --> 18:49.788
- Want it?
- Yeah, sure.

18:49.913 --> 18:51.957
You gotta do something
about that broad, bro.

18:52.082 --> 18:55.419
I mean, she's bad for you and me,
especially me.

18:55.544 --> 18:59.339
That's the thing. Evelyn and I, it's...

18:59.423 --> 19:02.050
- It's not working.
- You guys breaking up?

19:02.176 --> 19:05.262
Evelyn is a very sweet girl,

19:05.345 --> 19:08.515
and the sex is...

19:08.640 --> 19:10.476
- is rad.
- Yeah.

19:10.559 --> 19:14.813
But she can be such a stark,
raving lunatic sometimes.

19:14.938 --> 19:18.776
- Agreed.
- I just don't think we fit anymore.

19:18.859 --> 19:21.195
When are you dropping the bomb?
I'll start making some calls.

19:21.445 --> 19:24.615
I've never been the dumper,

19:24.740 --> 19:27.409
I've always been the dumpee.

19:27.951 --> 19:31.747
Shit, bro. Kicking a girl to the curb
is the easiest part of a relationship.

19:31.872 --> 19:34.208
Text dump her, it's quick, easy

19:34.333 --> 19:37.836
and depending on your wireless plan,
it can even be free.

19:37.961 --> 19:41.965
- I can't text dump her.
- What, you don't have unlimited texting?

19:42.049 --> 19:43.884
We live together.

19:44.635 --> 19:49.598
That's on you. That is on you.
I can't help you there.

19:50.140 --> 19:52.226
You're not gonna help me?

19:52.351 --> 19:55.103
All right, all right.

19:55.229 --> 19:57.231
This is what you're going to do.

19:57.314 --> 20:00.067
Pick a public place.
Somewhere with a lot of people.

20:00.150 --> 20:03.737
That ways if she freaks, starts kicking you
in the junk, someone will call 911.

20:03.862 --> 20:06.365
It has happened before. It happened
to me a couple of years back.

20:06.490 --> 20:09.535
That's neither here nor there.
Stake it out a day beforehand.

20:09.660 --> 20:14.373
Make sure you know where all the escape
routes are. A solid exit strategy is key.

20:18.168 --> 20:21.547
Don't worry, bro.
Evelyn's a tough chick.

20:21.672 --> 20:24.299
She'll be back on her feet in no time.

20:26.176 --> 20:29.388
<i>Live green or blog hard,
saving the world one blog at a time.</i>

20:29.471 --> 20:33.767
- Hey, it's it's me.
- <i>Oh, hey, baby. What's up?</i>

20:33.851 --> 20:35.394
Nothing. You?

20:36.270 --> 20:38.772
I am blogging up a storm today.

20:39.356 --> 20:42.901
I just... I have a...
a surprise for you.

20:43.193 --> 20:45.779
Oh. Well, what is it?

20:45.904 --> 20:51.410
I wouldn't wanna ruin it.
You wanna meet me at the dog park in 30?

20:52.411 --> 20:54.580
Oh, my God!

20:54.663 --> 20:57.416
- I know what it is.
- You do?

20:57.499 --> 21:00.002
You got a puppy!

21:00.085 --> 21:04.631
- Wait, it's a rescue, right?
- <i>Just meet me in 30, okay?</i>

21:04.715 --> 21:08.760
Okay. Max, you're the best
boyfriend ever.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.841
Someone call 911. Someone call 911!

21:49.134 --> 21:52.179
Evelyn! Evelyn!

21:54.973 --> 21:58.435
- Max.
- There's been an accident.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.604
Just stay still.
The ambulance is on its way.

22:00.687 --> 22:04.399
- Don't leave me.
- No, I'm right here. I'm right here.

22:05.025 --> 22:07.778
I don't want to die.

22:07.903 --> 22:11.031
- I don't want to leave you.
- You're not.

22:11.115 --> 22:14.701
We will always be together. Okay?

22:15.619 --> 22:17.204
Always and forever.

22:22.501 --> 22:24.837
Evelyn!

22:25.379 --> 22:27.464
Ev!

22:28.048 --> 22:31.260
Ev! Evelyn!

22:31.385 --> 22:35.681
Please, please, Ev.

23:04.418 --> 23:07.254
I'm here for you, brother. Okay?

24:16.824 --> 24:21.995
<i>The grief of his wife's death
became greater and greater agony.</i>

24:22.496 --> 24:25.833
<i>The home that they had so long
shared together</i>

24:25.916 --> 24:28.544
<i>became a tomb.</i>

24:30.003 --> 24:33.257
<i>The ever-beautiful flowers
she had planted</i>

24:33.382 --> 24:35.259
<i>with her own hands</i>

24:35.342 --> 24:40.597
<i>became nothing more
than the lost roses of her cheeks.</i>

24:42.516 --> 24:46.186
It's Travis, man. Open up.
I know you're in there.

24:46.311 --> 24:49.314
Come on, I swear
I don't have anyone with me.

24:49.439 --> 24:52.484
Don't make me use my keys.

24:58.532 --> 25:00.909
What's up, Max?

25:10.711 --> 25:15.883
I guess... I guess you haven't had time
to drop this shit off at Goodwill?

25:16.550 --> 25:19.845
- What? Too soon?
- You're a dick.

25:19.970 --> 25:22.639
Come on! You were going to break up
with her anyways, remember?

25:22.723 --> 25:25.517
Yeah, well... I killed her instead.

25:25.642 --> 25:29.313
Hey, that is bullshit and you know it.

25:29.813 --> 25:33.650
I don't know. I just can't help but think
that if I'd stuck it out a little,

25:33.734 --> 25:35.402
we would have...

25:35.527 --> 25:39.865
we would have found common ground,
we would've been happy again.

25:39.948 --> 25:41.450
I refuse to let you talk like that

25:41.575 --> 25:45.370
and I refuse to let you rot away
in this shrine to your ex.

25:45.496 --> 25:47.998
What am I supposed to do?

25:48.081 --> 25:50.250
All the things you used to love to do.

25:50.375 --> 25:54.838
I don't know. It's hard to remember
who I was before her.

25:54.963 --> 25:59.176
Well, you used to love going
to the movies and...

25:59.259 --> 26:03.222
there just so happens to be
a double feature at the New Bev tonight.

26:03.347 --> 26:06.600
- Could be fun.
- Do you want to go the movies with me?

26:07.100 --> 26:10.103
I would love to go
to the movies with you, but...

26:10.187 --> 26:13.857
Actually I got a smoking hot date
with this MILF, Janine,

26:13.941 --> 26:16.276
and I met her on Tinder and I could...

26:17.111 --> 26:19.780
could really use the apartment.

26:19.863 --> 26:21.532
No.

26:21.615 --> 26:24.368
Hey, it was worth a shot.
Good seeing you again, bro.

26:25.285 --> 26:29.832
Hey, ladies! Max is single
and ready to mingle!

26:31.083 --> 26:34.962
<i>Delivering from the bitter pains
of eternal death,</i>

26:35.087 --> 26:39.466
<i>the woman was a wicked woman,
and she was dead in her own life.</i>

26:39.591 --> 26:42.886
<i>Yea, Lord, pity them who are dead,</i>

26:43.011 --> 26:47.224
<i>and give peace and happiness
to the living.</i>

27:03.907 --> 27:05.909
Hey, Fruit Brute!

27:06.452 --> 27:07.786
Fruit brute!

27:09.955 --> 27:12.332
- Hi.
- Hey.

27:13.083 --> 27:16.003
You don't remember me do you?
Oh, my God!

27:16.086 --> 27:20.007
- I just made an ass out of myself.
- No, no, no. I... I do.

27:20.090 --> 27:24.178
- Ice Cream, right?
- Yes. Olivia.

27:24.261 --> 27:26.513
- Max.
- Hi.

27:27.181 --> 27:28.932
A Val Lewton fan, I see.

27:29.016 --> 27:32.352
Oh, yeah, well, the guy took
what could've been B-movie exploitation...

27:32.436 --> 27:35.105
And turned it into
the art house cinema, I know.

27:36.273 --> 27:39.526
Is your... Is your girlfriend here?

27:40.444 --> 27:43.405
No, no. She...

27:43.530 --> 27:48.368
- She moved on.
- Sorry. It happens, you know.

27:48.911 --> 27:51.872
I just broke up with this guy
I was seeing because he...

27:51.955 --> 27:54.708
he suddenly decided to become
a born again Christian.

27:54.792 --> 27:58.629
Yea, my ex could be
a little extreme, too.

27:58.712 --> 28:01.048
Not quite like this. It was like...

28:01.173 --> 28:05.052
no smoking, no drinking, no sex.

28:05.135 --> 28:08.222
I was, like, totally losing my shit.
I was like...

28:08.305 --> 28:11.517
will somebody please
just have sex with me.

28:11.642 --> 28:13.811
- Right here, baby!
- Oh, my God!

28:13.894 --> 28:17.106
That sounded really bad.

28:17.815 --> 28:20.234
Okay, anyway,
it was really nice running into you.

28:21.026 --> 28:23.487
You, too.

28:23.570 --> 28:26.240
- Bye.
- Bye.

28:29.660 --> 28:31.745
Hey...

28:32.287 --> 28:34.873
are you doing anything, like, right now?

28:35.582 --> 28:37.417
- Right now?
- Because you know, I was...

28:37.501 --> 28:44.091
I was thinking, you know, you never...
never did get that malted you wanted.

28:44.174 --> 28:49.179
So, I took off all of my clothes and I stood
right in front of him and I said,

28:49.304 --> 28:53.600
"You either pick Jesus or you pick me."

28:54.810 --> 28:57.146
He picked Jesus.

28:57.271 --> 28:59.606
- No way.
- Way.

28:59.731 --> 29:02.860
He then joined this Christian rock band.

29:02.985 --> 29:05.195
You want to know what they are called?

29:05.279 --> 29:08.907
The Christians Slaters.

29:09.616 --> 29:12.077
That is too funny.

29:14.288 --> 29:17.166
So... how did you break up with yours?

29:19.126 --> 29:21.462
I...

29:22.421 --> 29:25.883
I sort of threw her under the bus.

29:26.300 --> 29:29.470
I still feel pretty bad about it.

29:30.262 --> 29:33.765
Well, if it's any consolation,

29:33.891 --> 29:39.229
you know, she was... a tad feisty.

29:39.313 --> 29:41.231
Yeah, we had our differences.

29:41.648 --> 29:44.818
I mean, she wouldn't know half the stuff
we're talking about tonight.

29:45.861 --> 29:50.115
I guess, it just... wasn't meant to be.

29:50.199 --> 29:51.200
Yeah.

29:51.408 --> 29:54.828
I don't think we should be talking about
our exes. It's, like, bad luck or something.

29:55.871 --> 30:00.000
- It actually kind of helps.
- Well, then I'm happy to help.

30:03.670 --> 30:06.256
To moving on.

30:07.257 --> 30:08.425
To moving on.

30:08.717 --> 30:11.762
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

30:15.808 --> 30:18.685
Hey, do you want to do something fun?

30:19.353 --> 30:21.271
- Dying to.
- Okay, good.

30:21.355 --> 30:26.068
But you have to promise
not to call me crazy. Do you promise?

30:28.695 --> 30:30.989
- Yeah, I promise.
- Okay.

30:31.532 --> 30:35.702
I love coming here.
It's like, so peaceful and quiet.

30:37.246 --> 30:39.456
You are crazy.

30:39.540 --> 30:44.044
Come on, this isn't just any cemetery,
this is the Hollywood Forever cemetery.

30:44.169 --> 30:46.547
You know who's buried here?

30:46.630 --> 30:49.800
Yeah. I can think of one.

30:49.925 --> 30:52.636
Peter Lorre,

30:52.761 --> 30:55.389
John Huston,

30:55.472 --> 30:57.766
Johnny Ramone.

30:57.891 --> 31:00.644
How cool is that? Johnny Ramone.

31:00.769 --> 31:03.230
- That is pretty cool.
- Yeah.

31:04.148 --> 31:06.859
- Hey, Max.
- What?

31:07.818 --> 31:10.654
They're coming to get you, Max.

31:11.196 --> 31:14.825
- Stop. Stop, stop
- They're coming for you.

31:14.908 --> 31:19.079
- You know I ran track in high school.
- They're coming for you!

31:19.163 --> 31:22.666
- I'm coming to get you.
- Yeah, right.

31:22.791 --> 31:25.210
I'm going to get you.

32:01.205 --> 32:03.373
I'm really sorry
I'm devouring you like this.

32:03.499 --> 32:06.168
- Please continue.
- Okay.

32:06.251 --> 32:09.338
It's just...
It's been a really long time.

32:09.463 --> 32:11.590
Ditto.

32:12.758 --> 32:16.178
But... we should... we should stop.

32:16.303 --> 32:19.431
Really? I mean, we're both
responsible adults, right?

32:19.723 --> 32:20.974
- Right.
- Right.

32:21.058 --> 32:22.351
Yeah.

32:26.480 --> 32:29.358
- But we really should stop.
- Really?

32:29.483 --> 32:31.652
- Yeah.
- Yeah... we should.

32:31.735 --> 32:34.321
I have to open up the shop
in the morning, anyway.

32:34.446 --> 32:36.657
- Where do you work?
- Bloody Mary's.

32:37.074 --> 32:40.869
You should come by. I'll give you
a discount on fake blood pellets.

32:41.829 --> 32:44.206
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

32:47.960 --> 32:52.506
Hey... I had a really,
really good time tonight, Max.

32:52.589 --> 32:54.716
Me, too.

32:55.092 --> 32:58.262
- See you soon?
- Yeah. Definitely.

32:58.345 --> 33:00.514
Okay.

33:04.518 --> 33:06.645
Okay.

33:06.770 --> 33:08.439
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:27.124 --> 33:29.460
Thank you.

33:30.252 --> 33:31.712
Thank you very much.

33:33.297 --> 33:36.758
I knew... son of a bitch!

33:37.301 --> 33:39.803
Well, that wasn't a very
warm reception, Max.

33:39.887 --> 33:43.557
I'm just a little freaked out here.
Just give me a second.

33:43.891 --> 33:47.811
This is all a flashback to the time
you shroomed out on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.

33:47.895 --> 33:50.981
It's cold out here.
I'm gonna catch my death.

33:51.064 --> 33:53.275
Coming.

33:53.358 --> 33:57.488
You're going to open that door
and there's not going to be anyone there.

34:00.032 --> 34:02.409
Hey, Max. I'm back!

34:02.534 --> 34:04.953
- Fuck me!
- Oh, you read my mind.

34:05.078 --> 34:08.248
- Wait, wait, please. Stop, stop, stop!
- Oh, baby. What's wrong?

34:08.331 --> 34:11.918
What's wrong? You died. I saw you die.

34:12.002 --> 34:15.172
- I know, freaky deaky, right?
- But how?

34:15.255 --> 34:18.175
- True love conquers all.
- That doesn't make any sense.

34:18.300 --> 34:19.885
Yes, it does.

34:20.219 --> 34:23.597
Don't you see? Our love
has been given a second chance

34:23.679 --> 34:27.559
- and we have to seize the opportunity.
- That's really unnecessary.

34:27.684 --> 34:29.561
- Oh, my God!
- What?

34:34.525 --> 34:39.196
- You kept the runner.
- Yeah, yeah. Why wouldn't I?

34:39.279 --> 34:42.574
Well, you know how guys are.
Always trading in for a newer model.

34:43.534 --> 34:47.036
- I would never do that.
- Good.

34:47.121 --> 34:50.748
Because if you did,
you'd be fucking dead, right now!

34:56.088 --> 34:59.466
Oh, baby! I'm just screwing with you.

34:59.591 --> 35:03.428
Speaking of which... Oh, I'm so horny.

35:03.512 --> 35:05.055
Oh, let's play, baby...

35:05.139 --> 35:07.558
Don't... don't... don't you think
you should take a shower first?

35:07.683 --> 35:12.146
- I mean, you were dead for a long time.
- Only if you come with me.

35:12.229 --> 35:16.150
You know I hate going to bed
with my hair wet.

35:16.859 --> 35:19.319
Such a wuss.

35:20.988 --> 35:24.074
- I'll be quick.
- Take your time.

35:28.579 --> 35:29.663
Shit!

35:29.955 --> 35:32.708
- Who is it?
- Olivia!

35:32.791 --> 35:34.918
Oh, goddamn it!

35:36.044 --> 35:38.964
Just give me a second, just one second.

35:40.424 --> 35:43.635
- Hi, again.
- Hey, what a surprise.

35:43.760 --> 35:47.347
Listen, I was just thinking
about what you said earlier.

35:47.473 --> 35:50.517
Yeah. What did I say?
I said a lot of things.

35:50.601 --> 35:53.562
You know, about us being
responsible adults and everything.

35:53.687 --> 35:55.898
- Right, that.
- I just think, you know,

35:55.981 --> 35:58.942
If I want to and if you want to,

35:59.026 --> 36:02.112
then I think that we should just...
you know, we should go for it, right?

36:02.196 --> 36:07.201
I mean, it's going to happen
eventually anyway, right?

36:07.910 --> 36:09.286
- Right?
- Yeah, about that.

36:09.411 --> 36:12.206
I think I may have spoken
a bit too soon.

36:12.289 --> 36:14.124
Awesome!

36:14.208 --> 36:16.293
I'm sorry.

36:18.170 --> 36:20.589
- What?
- I just think...

36:20.714 --> 36:25.469
I think we will both enjoy it
a lot more if we just wait.

36:25.594 --> 36:28.472
Right. Okay.

36:30.015 --> 36:33.602
You probably think I'm...
just... like, a big hoe-bag now.

36:33.685 --> 36:36.438
No, I really don't think
you're a big hoe-bag.

36:36.563 --> 36:39.942
- Little bit, little bit?
- Not even the slightest.

36:40.025 --> 36:42.152
Okay. Well, I...

36:42.277 --> 36:44.655
- I'll... I'm gonna go.
- Yeah, see you.

36:44.780 --> 36:47.741
We're out of shampoo, baby.

36:47.825 --> 36:50.911
- Who was that?
- Did you hear that?

36:51.036 --> 36:54.331
The walls here are so thin.

36:54.414 --> 36:56.917
Right. I hate that.

36:57.042 --> 37:01.171
That's another reason why
I think that we should wait.

37:01.255 --> 37:04.341
Because you don't want
the neighbors hearing us

37:04.424 --> 37:08.262
going at it like a pack
of sex-crazed hyenas,

37:08.387 --> 37:12.099
pounding away at each other all night.

37:12.224 --> 37:17.479
- You know?
- Yeah. No! I don't think that would...

37:17.604 --> 37:19.940
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:20.065 --> 37:23.360
Okay. Yeah, so I'll see you... Bye.

37:23.485 --> 37:26.530
- Bye.
- Yeah, okay.

37:29.616 --> 37:31.869
Who was that?

37:31.952 --> 37:34.705
- FedEx.
- This late?

37:34.788 --> 37:40.085
Yeah, well, when it absolutely
and positively has to be there overnight.

37:40.878 --> 37:45.549
Well, I have a special delivery for you.

37:48.135 --> 37:50.179
Are you sure you don't want
to dry off first?

37:50.387 --> 37:52.764
The wetter the better, baby.

37:59.188 --> 38:00.606
Oh, dear.

38:09.114 --> 38:14.286
Oh, God! That freaking hurt.

38:15.454 --> 38:17.873
I never said I was graceful.

38:17.956 --> 38:20.584
You won't die.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.922
No.

38:25.339 --> 38:28.383
You said we'd always be together.

38:28.509 --> 38:31.178
That night at the shop.

38:31.887 --> 38:34.890
Always and forever.

38:35.432 --> 38:38.268
The Satan Genie.

38:40.104 --> 38:43.148
I guess it wasn't
a load of horseshit after all.

38:43.232 --> 38:46.360
I stand corrected.

38:46.443 --> 38:48.445
This...

38:49.113 --> 38:52.032
is gonna be fun.

38:52.574 --> 38:54.118
Now, where were we?

39:03.752 --> 39:07.673
Embalming fluid. Gross!

39:16.849 --> 39:19.643
Worst nightmare ever.

39:19.726 --> 39:21.728
Hi.

39:22.855 --> 39:25.315
Oh, come on.
My morning face is not that bad.

39:25.399 --> 39:30.779
Sorry, I'm just having a nightmare.
I mean, I was having a nightmare.

39:30.904 --> 39:33.198
- How did you sleep?
- Oh, not a wink.

39:33.282 --> 39:36.368
I have all this energy, like I drank
100 Red Bulls or something.

39:36.493 --> 39:39.538
And I think like in a jiffy. Real quick.

39:40.164 --> 39:42.541
Did we...

39:42.666 --> 39:44.084
We didn't...

39:44.168 --> 39:46.253
- Have sex?
- Yeah.

39:46.378 --> 39:48.422
No, you passed out.

39:48.505 --> 39:51.175
Your penis is the size
of a marsh mellow mini.

39:51.508 --> 39:55.429
But you're awake now.
Time to wake up, goony bird!

39:55.512 --> 39:58.515
Evelyn, Evelyn, Ev... Do you think
we should have breakfast first?

39:58.599 --> 40:01.810
Maybe just some for carbs, energy.

40:01.935 --> 40:05.522
No, it's the craziest thing.
I'm not even hungry.

40:05.647 --> 40:10.152
I'm gonna lose so much weight.
Being dead is the best diet ever.

40:10.652 --> 40:14.114
Would you look at the time.
I'm gonna be late for work.

40:14.198 --> 40:16.658
No, no, no, don't go.
Let me have a quickie first.

40:16.784 --> 40:20.454
Please Evelyn, you just rose from the dead,
you deserve more than a quickie.

40:20.788 --> 40:22.664
Wait, then when are you gonna be back?

40:22.748 --> 40:27.753
I don't know. It's the Halloween season
and things get real crazy so don't wait up.

40:32.800 --> 40:36.720
Come on, Travis. Pick up.

40:36.845 --> 40:40.390
We got shirts, we got suits,
we got ties, we got belts.

40:40.474 --> 40:43.644
Hey, baby, you've ever banged a Viking?

40:43.727 --> 40:47.439
Once he goes Norse
you'll have no remorse.

40:47.940 --> 40:50.150
Shit!

40:52.319 --> 40:54.363
I told you not to call me
at the office, bro.

40:54.655 --> 40:58.492
Travis, whatever you do,
do not go back to my apartment.

40:58.575 --> 41:01.036
Negativo. I got a scorching
hot date tonight

41:01.120 --> 41:04.832
with the centerfold from this month's
FHM and she lives with the rents.

41:04.915 --> 41:09.086
It's Evelyn. She's back
and she's in my apartment, right now.

41:09.169 --> 41:13.090
Max... please... please, don't tell me
you ate that acid I left in your fridge.

41:13.173 --> 41:16.009
Travis, I'm serious! She's is back.

41:16.093 --> 41:19.388
She's dead and she thinks
we're still dating.

41:19.513 --> 41:21.223
<i>Okay. Settle down.</i>

41:21.348 --> 41:25.936
It'll wear off in 10-12 hours.
Just don't operate any heavy machinery.

41:26.145 --> 41:28.730
<i>Look, I gotta go, okay?
I gotta get back to work.</i>

41:29.022 --> 41:33.777
Just sit in the corner and listen to some
music. I don't know. All right, bye.

41:34.486 --> 41:37.489
Okay, come on, you got me into this,
you gotta get...

41:43.454 --> 41:46.457
Oh, shit.

41:51.170 --> 41:53.005
"Straight to Hades:

41:53.130 --> 41:58.302
A Guide for Ridding the Unwelcome Undead
By Baron Olaf III, Ph.D, Esquire."

41:59.553 --> 42:03.182
Salt, flour, celery...

42:03.474 --> 42:07.352
What the... Parsley? Really?
You gotta be kidding me.

42:07.436 --> 42:10.647
Wolfsbane. Yeah, 'cause I got
a lot of wolfsbane lying around.

42:10.773 --> 42:13.901
"Blow directly into face."

42:14.026 --> 42:15.444
Okay.

42:24.578 --> 42:26.830
You're gonna die.

42:26.914 --> 42:30.751
- Excuse me?
- One day you're gonna die.

42:30.834 --> 42:33.003
I'm going to be left all on my lonesome.

42:33.086 --> 42:36.298
Well, I'll still be with you
in, like, spirit or whatever.

42:36.381 --> 42:40.010
You know I can't go on without you.

42:40.093 --> 42:42.095
But if I make you like me...

42:42.221 --> 42:45.390
Ev... just... think about
what you're saying here.

42:45.516 --> 42:49.853
It's the only way that we can be together
forever, like we promised.

42:49.978 --> 42:54.942
We can get married, buy a house,
have a tons of babies.

42:55.025 --> 42:56.360
What the hell is that?

42:56.443 --> 42:59.780
It's just a little something
I like to call...

43:13.961 --> 43:16.964
I thought I was gonna sneeze.

43:17.089 --> 43:19.424
What was that about?

43:19.550 --> 43:24.888
Just a new recipe I wanted to try.
Didn't really work out for me.

43:24.972 --> 43:27.224
You're so silly sometimes.

43:27.349 --> 43:30.769
Seriously, if I kill you,

43:30.853 --> 43:33.439
then we get to live happily ever after.

43:34.356 --> 43:37.609
Can I... can I... can I say no?

43:38.861 --> 43:42.739
- What?
- No, no, it's nothing... nothing personal.

43:42.865 --> 43:45.325
I just...

43:46.535 --> 43:49.621
I would like to go dancing tonight.

43:50.747 --> 43:52.332
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:52.458 --> 43:56.670
- Dancing?
- Yeah. Yeah, to celebrate your return.

43:56.795 --> 43:59.131
Max, you've never been
to a club in your entire life.

43:59.214 --> 44:04.136
I know, I know, but if I'm gonna die,
I'd like to live it up.

44:04.219 --> 44:06.972
Okay, where?

44:07.514 --> 44:11.727
I don't know. Somewhere
where you won't... stick out.

44:29.870 --> 44:34.041
- You're girlfriend is so goth.
- Who does her makeup?

44:34.124 --> 44:36.043
- She's au naturel.
- Hey!

44:37.252 --> 44:39.505
Stop eye-banging my boyfriend, Morticia.

44:40.464 --> 44:44.009
Come on, you wanna step?
Bring it, bitches.

44:49.389 --> 44:53.435
Come on, baby, let's go get
our drink on. Yeah.

44:58.732 --> 45:03.821
Excuse me, what's the closest thing
you have to an elephant tranquilizer?

45:04.613 --> 45:08.367
- Absinthe.
- Make it a double.

45:11.745 --> 45:14.039
You dance with the green fairy before?

45:14.164 --> 45:15.999
There's a first time for everything.

45:28.679 --> 45:32.599
- Careful, this stuff will kill you.
- I'm not so sure about that.

45:38.647 --> 45:40.524
Again.

45:40.649 --> 45:42.901
Your funeral.

45:43.026 --> 45:46.238
Been there, baby, done that.

45:57.332 --> 45:59.710
One more for the road.

46:00.461 --> 46:01.920
You heard the lady.

46:18.896 --> 46:21.482
Oh, baby. Hold me, I'm cold.

46:21.565 --> 46:24.359
No. You're good.

46:28.238 --> 46:32.659
Urge to purge. Urge to purge!
Oh, baby, you're on hair duty.

46:36.663 --> 46:41.543
Oh, baby. Green fairy kicking my ass!

46:41.668 --> 46:46.256
All right, round two!
Ding, ding, ding, ding!

46:47.925 --> 46:51.261
- Max?
- Olivia!

46:51.386 --> 46:53.514
- Hi.
- Hey.

46:55.474 --> 46:59.520
- What are the odds?
- Yeah. Is your friend okay?

47:00.437 --> 47:03.273
Yeah, just a little worse for the wear.

47:03.607 --> 47:06.527
Yeah, doesn't know when to quit?

47:06.777 --> 47:10.447
- Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
- Oh, I can't feel my face.

47:10.531 --> 47:12.533
- What's up?
- Nothing, just...

47:12.616 --> 47:16.370
we're going to check out this club,
me and my... my lady friends.

47:16.495 --> 47:19.581
Well, you can skip it.
It's dead in there.

47:19.665 --> 47:21.667
- Get it?
- Yeah.

47:21.792 --> 47:23.919
O, M effing G!

47:24.044 --> 47:26.338
This is the guy you've been crushing on?

47:26.421 --> 47:28.966
God, please stop. That's so rude.
I'm so sorry.

47:29.049 --> 47:31.969
That's just too many appletinis.

47:33.637 --> 47:37.724
- Well, duty calls.
- Yeah, do what you gotta.

47:38.475 --> 47:41.478
- Holla!
- I will.

47:41.562 --> 47:46.024
You two suck, you know that?
So embarrassing.

47:47.734 --> 47:49.486
All right.

47:49.570 --> 47:54.324
Baby, we're going to make
sweet, sweet love tonight.

47:59.246 --> 48:02.958
No, no, no, that's a Dirty Sanchez.
A rusty trombone is when...

48:06.295 --> 48:08.005
Oh, brother.

48:08.130 --> 48:11.216
Is this the kind of freaky shit
you're into?

48:11.341 --> 48:15.345
No. But I... I could be.

48:18.515 --> 48:21.602
- You've gone necro, bro!
- She's not dead, Travis.

48:21.685 --> 48:25.355
At least not in a traditional sense.

48:25.773 --> 48:27.691
Now, please, help me take her to bed.

48:27.775 --> 48:30.861
- No, I'm not touching that bitch.
- Travis!

48:31.612 --> 48:35.491
Because you're my boy, but you put her
back in the ground when you're done.

48:35.616 --> 48:37.951
- You got any gloves?
- Please Travis!

48:41.497 --> 48:43.415
Baby.

48:44.625 --> 48:47.294
What the hell?

48:50.297 --> 48:52.841
What were you going to do?

48:52.925 --> 48:54.468
Funny man.

48:54.551 --> 48:57.471
Were you gonna draw a dick on my face?

48:57.554 --> 49:00.808
You gonna put my fingers in warm water?

49:03.435 --> 49:05.854
What is that smell?

49:05.979 --> 49:08.732
- I shit my pants.
- You shit your...

49:08.857 --> 49:12.778
Eve, I was actually just
showing Travis the door.

49:14.196 --> 49:16.740
You've... you've had a...

49:16.824 --> 49:21.203
You really partied like a champ tonight,
I think you should just go and rest.

49:21.286 --> 49:26.416
Screw that. I'm up now and you'd better
be too, if you know what I mean!

49:29.169 --> 49:33.173
Hey, why don't you have this?
I'll be right back, okay?

49:35.425 --> 49:38.345
Travis. Travis, wait.

49:38.428 --> 49:41.473
Dude, what kind of voodoo
did you do in there, Max?

49:41.598 --> 49:43.100
I didn't, I swear.

49:43.183 --> 49:45.769
There's a freaking Tim Burton movie
in your living room.

49:45.853 --> 49:47.688
My God, she could be
one of the infected.

49:47.813 --> 49:49.523
Please tell me you wore a condom
when you were banging her.

49:49.606 --> 49:53.026
It's not a virus thing Travis.
It's more of a...

49:53.110 --> 49:54.945
"Be careful what you wish for" thing.

49:55.070 --> 49:58.782
I would seriously invest in a hazmat suit,
if I were you. Peace.

49:58.866 --> 50:00.993
- You're just gonna take off?
- Yup.

50:01.076 --> 50:03.370
- You aren't even gonna help me?
- Nope.

50:03.454 --> 50:06.582
- Travis, she wants to kill me.
- Sooner or later, all broads do.

50:06.707 --> 50:08.959
- But I thought we were bros.
- Half bros.

50:09.042 --> 50:11.920
Travis, please, just tell me what to do.

50:12.004 --> 50:15.048
What you were supposed to do
in the first place, dump her ass.

50:15.174 --> 50:17.718
Just hope she doesn't eat
your brains first.

51:26.036 --> 51:30.374
People think I'm just a girl
Just a girl from another world...

51:30.457 --> 51:33.585
Good morning. I made breakfast.

51:33.669 --> 51:35.921
Here, sit.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.900
I used chocolate chips.
Just like at IHOP.

52:00.404 --> 52:02.906
Dig in. I'm not hungry.

52:03.991 --> 52:08.912
So... have you thought about our talk?

52:09.037 --> 52:10.831
Together forever.

52:11.248 --> 52:13.876
Yeah, about that.

52:14.585 --> 52:16.587
What's wrong?

52:16.712 --> 52:20.090
Well, I just feel like
things are getting

52:20.174 --> 52:24.094
a little bit... stale.

52:24.678 --> 52:27.514
- Stale?
- Wrong word. Sorry.

52:27.931 --> 52:29.224
What are you trying to say?

52:29.308 --> 52:32.686
I just think before we take such a...

52:32.811 --> 52:35.689
drastic step in our relationship,

52:35.773 --> 52:39.693
how would you feel about taking

52:39.777 --> 52:42.946
a very small...

52:43.071 --> 52:44.823
break?

52:44.948 --> 52:47.284
More of a breather, really.

52:47.910 --> 52:53.040
- Are you breaking up with me?
- No, it's just a breather.

52:53.165 --> 52:57.669
I dug myself out of a grave for you.

52:57.795 --> 53:03.217
Do you have any idea how hard it is
digging yourself out of a grave?

53:03.300 --> 53:06.053
It's freaking hard!

53:06.386 --> 53:08.722
And there goes the deposit.

53:08.806 --> 53:12.267
- I can't believe you.
- Ev, you're drawing blood.

53:12.392 --> 53:15.562
Where do you get the balls
to even ask me if I want a break?

53:15.687 --> 53:18.148
See, I'm asking...

53:18.232 --> 53:21.235
if you want to take a break.

53:21.318 --> 53:23.779
Because I'm worried that I am not
giving you what you need,

53:23.904 --> 53:27.366
what you want, what you deserve.

53:27.491 --> 53:30.786
Lord knows you deserve so much.

53:32.663 --> 53:34.498
Baby!

53:34.623 --> 53:36.500
Don't be silly.

53:36.583 --> 53:39.628
You are the best boyfriend ever.

53:40.170 --> 53:43.132
Oh, you make me so happy.

53:43.215 --> 53:45.342
Too tight!

53:50.347 --> 53:52.599
<i>You always loved violence.</i>

53:52.683 --> 53:55.853
Thank you, go to hell.

53:56.437 --> 53:58.647
Hey, why don't you go to hell?

53:58.981 --> 54:01.900
Already there, sir.

54:07.656 --> 54:10.284
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:10.409 --> 54:13.078
- Rough night?
- Rough life.

54:13.203 --> 54:17.791
Yeah. I thought you might be a little
hung over so I brought you a remedy

54:17.875 --> 54:21.545
that's been in my family for years.

54:24.840 --> 54:29.261
Olivia, you are an angel from heaven.

54:29.386 --> 54:31.680
Yeah, I know.

54:33.223 --> 54:37.978
Must be nice having your own place.
Making your own hours.

54:38.061 --> 54:41.315
Greeting customers the way you want.

54:41.398 --> 54:43.192
Eating burgers whenever you want.

54:43.317 --> 54:47.696
Yeah, I'm thinking about sub-letting
the space on the other side.

54:47.780 --> 54:50.741
If you know anyone who is interested,
it would make a really great spot

54:50.866 --> 54:54.161
for like a start-up. I think.

54:54.286 --> 54:57.372
I did, but...

54:57.498 --> 55:00.334
I don't think he's chasing
that dream anymore.

55:00.459 --> 55:02.461
That's too bad.

55:03.170 --> 55:09.384
Sometimes people just...
gotta take a chance, you know.

55:20.145 --> 55:23.440
- I should probably get that.
- Yeah.

55:31.156 --> 55:34.910
- Who dare call Bloody Mary's?
- Hey, baby.

55:36.829 --> 55:41.041
Hi. I'm a little busy right now.

55:41.166 --> 55:43.627
Okay. I was just thinking
about you and I wanted to call.

55:44.795 --> 55:46.004
<i>That's nice.</i>

55:47.631 --> 55:49.633
I'm with a customer.

55:49.758 --> 55:51.218
<i>Okay.</i>

55:51.635 --> 55:53.637
- <i>Max?</i>
- Yeah?

55:53.762 --> 55:55.139
I love you.

55:55.264 --> 56:00.519
That's great. That's really great.

56:01.145 --> 56:03.230
- <i>Did you hear what I said?</i>
- Yeah. Yeah.

56:03.897 --> 56:07.109
- I said I love you.
- Loud and clear.

56:07.234 --> 56:09.987
<i>Well, aren't you going to say it back?</i>

56:10.612 --> 56:12.239
<i>Max?</i>

56:13.240 --> 56:14.658
Hello?

56:15.409 --> 56:18.454
Yeah, love you back, bye.

56:20.747 --> 56:22.541
My boss is...

56:25.085 --> 56:27.588
Yeah, you know...

56:28.005 --> 56:31.258
- cut the crap, Max.
- Please, just let me explain. Okay?

56:31.341 --> 56:33.969
No, you don't have to explain anything.

56:34.052 --> 56:36.555
I know exactly what's going on.

56:36.680 --> 56:40.017
- I really don't think you do.
- It's obvious.

56:40.142 --> 56:43.937
- You're not over your ex yet.
- It's not me Olivia, it's her.

56:44.021 --> 56:46.273
She won't get out of my life.

56:46.398 --> 56:50.486
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna, like,
share you with someone else, you know.

56:50.611 --> 56:56.241
I already tried that with my ex-boyfriend
and you know how that turned out, so...

56:56.658 --> 57:01.038
Believe me, Olivia,
I really, really like you.

57:01.121 --> 57:04.666
Well, there's only so much rejection
that I can take.

57:05.834 --> 57:09.213
If you want to be with me,
then you'll be with me.

57:12.800 --> 57:14.968
Okay.

57:17.513 --> 57:18.847
You know...

57:18.931 --> 57:23.560
they're showing Night of the Living Dead
tomorrow night at the Hollywood Forever,

57:23.644 --> 57:28.190
and I'll be there,
if you want to meet me,

57:28.315 --> 57:32.152
and if not, that's totally fine.

57:32.236 --> 57:37.324
But, you know,
it was nice to know you, then.

57:37.866 --> 57:39.993
Okay.

57:40.077 --> 57:42.246
Bye.

57:44.331 --> 57:47.709
So you're saying I should re-kill my ex?

57:47.835 --> 57:50.504
Seeing as you can't nad up,
I say you got no choice.

57:50.587 --> 57:56.593
Yeah, but I tried. I tried and she went all
28 Weeks Later on me.

57:56.718 --> 58:00.389
Listen, that girl in our apartment
is not Evelyn anymore.

58:00.472 --> 58:04.351
She's Zombie Evelyn. She's "Zevelin."

58:06.353 --> 58:07.855
You know.

58:08.856 --> 58:12.693
- <i>Renta! Renta!</i>
- <i>Travis estÃ¡ en la biblioteca.</i>

58:12.776 --> 58:15.404
And what am I supposed to do anyway?

58:15.529 --> 58:19.283
I saw her get hit by a bus

58:19.366 --> 58:23.829
and break her neck
and she's still going.

58:25.456 --> 58:28.375
Bullet to the brain? I mean,
works in all those zombie movies.

58:28.500 --> 58:30.836
No, no, no. I'm against firearms.

58:31.128 --> 58:34.006
- Stake through the heart.
- She's not a vampire.

58:35.799 --> 58:41.180
Electrocution. Bathtub,
hair dryer, zap. She's dead.

58:41.305 --> 58:44.850
I'd probably end up zapping myself.

58:46.727 --> 58:48.979
Let me see what we have around here.

58:49.062 --> 58:51.356
Th... There's...

58:56.820 --> 58:59.448
Good old fashioned beheading
ought to do it.

58:59.573 --> 59:02.493
Easy, too. Just go creeping
while she's asleeping.

59:03.118 --> 59:05.204
Evelyn doesn't sleep.

59:05.621 --> 59:09.166
Well, you'll just have
to get creative then.

59:26.100 --> 59:28.685
You're not gonna do what I think
you're gonna do, are you?

59:29.728 --> 59:33.649
- What on earth would that be?
- Don't play dumb, Max.

59:34.358 --> 59:37.027
You're gonna repaint the walls.

59:38.112 --> 59:44.493
You got me. I noticed the color was fading
so I was gonna... add another coat.

59:44.618 --> 59:48.080
That's sweet, Max. But you're gonna
have to wait until I finish my yoga.

59:48.205 --> 59:50.791
My chakra's off.

01:00:07.224 --> 01:00:12.813
Ever since I came back I can hit
all these poses I couldn't before.

01:00:13.564 --> 01:00:16.150
It's pretty rad.

01:00:26.577 --> 01:00:29.204
What are you doing, baby?

01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:31.915
Just...

01:00:32.416 --> 01:00:35.252
admiring your form.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:40.507
Om...

01:00:56.774 --> 01:01:00.444
Barry's Chinese Food!
It's the best deal in town!

01:01:00.778 --> 01:01:03.030
Barry's Chinese Food.

01:01:03.155 --> 01:01:05.657
Sup, killer? That was fast.

01:01:07.409 --> 01:01:09.411
All right.

01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:17.628
Where's the blood, where's the gore?
Where's the viscera?

01:01:18.128 --> 01:01:21.298
- I couldn't do it.
- What do you mean you couldn't do it?

01:01:22.508 --> 01:01:25.135
- Killing someone is hard.
- She's already dead, man!

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:29.973
It doesn't matter if she's alive
or dead. It's hard.

01:01:30.724 --> 01:01:34.645
I'm just gonna stand Olivia up tonight
and that will be the end of it.

01:01:34.728 --> 01:01:38.857
I'll let Evelyn eat me and turn me
into one of the living dead

01:01:38.982 --> 01:01:43.153
- and we can rot unhappily ever after.
- Stop it right now.

01:01:43.278 --> 01:01:45.572
You're meeting Olivia
at that cemetery tonight.

01:01:45.656 --> 01:01:48.492
I told you, Travis,
I'm not beheading my ex.

01:01:48.909 --> 01:01:51.036
You're not,

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:53.705
I am.

01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:56.542
No, this... this isn't your fight.

01:01:56.667 --> 01:01:59.670
I know, but I got this.

01:01:59.753 --> 01:02:04.216
- I don't really think you do.
- I got this, all right?

01:02:04.299 --> 01:02:07.010
I don't understand why do you have
to go into work tonight?

01:02:07.094 --> 01:02:09.430
It's just the graveyard shift, Ev.

01:02:09.513 --> 01:02:11.432
The night before Halloween
is always a bitch.

01:02:11.515 --> 01:02:15.018
Shelves gotta get stocked, pumpkins
gotta get carved, cobwebs gotta get hung.

01:02:15.102 --> 01:02:20.858
It just seems weird. You were never
this busy when I was... you know, alive.

01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:24.236
Well, that was the off-season
and this is game time.

01:02:24.653 --> 01:02:26.113
Well, try to get home early.

01:02:26.196 --> 01:02:30.617
I'll try but I have a feeling tonight
is gonna be a big one.

01:02:31.785 --> 01:02:34.079
Kiss, kiss.

01:02:54.183 --> 01:02:56.727
Goodbye, Evelyn.

01:03:00.856 --> 01:03:03.567
Goodbye, honey.

01:03:12.993 --> 01:03:14.661
Sure you're all right with this?

01:03:14.787 --> 01:03:16.830
Don't worry, bro.
I'm going to kill it in there.

01:03:17.748 --> 01:03:22.085
- All right, I owe you.
- That's what we do. We're family.

01:03:22.211 --> 01:03:24.338
Come here.

01:03:25.088 --> 01:03:27.007
Good luck, Max.

01:03:27.091 --> 01:03:29.676
Thank you. You, too.

01:03:53.158 --> 01:03:55.285
He's not here. Go home.

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:59.331
I just came to get my Gore-Gore Girls
DVD back. Max has had it for months.

01:03:59.456 --> 01:04:02.000
- You can get it tomorrow.
- No can do.

01:04:02.126 --> 01:04:06.922
I'm leaving on an epic snowboarding trip.
Won't be back till New Year's.

01:04:10.634 --> 01:04:15.889
Well, hello, Evelyn. You're looking
especially morbid this evening.

01:04:16.014 --> 01:04:18.392
Just get your DVD
and go home, douchebag.

01:04:18.475 --> 01:04:21.395
Easy, thriller. I'll be quick.

01:04:43.083 --> 01:04:45.377
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

01:04:45.461 --> 01:04:49.339
It's a nice night for zombie movie
surrounded by a bunch of dead people.

01:04:49.465 --> 01:04:52.468
I wouldn't have it any other way.

01:04:52.593 --> 01:04:57.514
- Shall we?
- We shall. Let's do it.

01:04:58.515 --> 01:05:00.684
Can't you just get it
when you come back?

01:05:00.768 --> 01:05:02.686
- Nope.
- Why?

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:05.856
Because it gets very lonely up there.
I need my spank material.

01:05:05.981 --> 01:05:09.568
- You are repulsive, you know that?
- Right back at ya, toots.

01:05:09.693 --> 01:05:12.696
Hallelujah! The Gore-Gore Girls.
It's an instant classic.

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.281
- Great, leave.
- No, no, no.

01:05:14.406 --> 01:05:17.075
- I've got to test it out first.
- Oh, come on.

01:05:17.201 --> 01:05:19.953
Last time I lent Max a DVD,
the damn thing got so scratched up

01:05:20.037 --> 01:05:23.123
it looked like a game of Tetris.
I was very upset.

01:05:23.207 --> 01:05:26.001
It was Wild Things... Two.

01:05:26.126 --> 01:05:28.962
I'm sure that your stuff is fine.
Now, please leave.

01:05:29.046 --> 01:05:30.964
Two minutes, okay?

01:05:31.048 --> 01:05:32.966
- Two minutes.
- Scout's honor.

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:35.219
- Two minutes.
- Yup.

01:05:36.637 --> 01:05:39.306
Do you have any...
Do you have any leftovers?

01:05:39.431 --> 01:05:41.350
Travis.

01:06:20.097 --> 01:06:24.601
What a goddess! They don't make them
like that anymore. Let me tell you.

01:06:24.726 --> 01:06:27.271
I feel my pants getting tighter.
It's getting so hot in here.

01:06:27.396 --> 01:06:30.190
Enough! Your precious porn is fine.
Now, get out.

01:06:30.274 --> 01:06:33.986
Just... slow your roll.
This is the best part.

01:06:34.695 --> 01:06:36.780
Here it comes.

01:06:36.905 --> 01:06:39.741
Oh, my God.

01:06:44.788 --> 01:06:46.832
How awesome is that?

01:06:46.915 --> 01:06:51.879
I hear they used real brains.
The director is very influential.

01:07:03.056 --> 01:07:05.517
I just got the strangest craving.

01:07:06.477 --> 01:07:08.645
Craving for what?

01:07:08.729 --> 01:07:10.689
Brains!

01:07:13.984 --> 01:07:16.779
Help! Help!

01:07:26.288 --> 01:07:28.916
Do you want to get out of here?

01:07:28.999 --> 01:07:30.709
Yeah.

01:07:30.834 --> 01:07:32.252
Okay.

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.892
- It's a little bit messy.
- It's all right.

01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:51.563
It's all right.

01:07:57.319 --> 01:08:01.156
- Happy Halloween.
- Trick or treat?

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.292
Get off me, you crazy bitch!

01:08:33.939 --> 01:08:37.734
You seem upset, Travis.
What's eating you?

01:08:52.957 --> 01:08:56.336
This better not go straight
to my thighs.

01:09:22.863 --> 01:09:24.907
Shit!

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:27.117
Travis.

01:09:29.536 --> 01:09:31.580
What's up?

01:09:32.247 --> 01:09:34.582
What, you're just gonna...

01:09:34.707 --> 01:09:38.462
hump me and dump me?
Didn't think you were the type.

01:09:38.587 --> 01:09:42.006
I've got to swing by my place
and check on something.

01:09:42.091 --> 01:09:45.051
I'll call you later, okay?

01:09:46.386 --> 01:09:51.100
I'm gonna... call...
catch a few more Z's.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.935
You wore me out.

01:09:55.062 --> 01:09:57.189
Hey...

01:09:57.815 --> 01:10:00.359
You were right, by the way.

01:10:00.442 --> 01:10:03.862
- About what?
- It was worth the wait.

01:10:08.659 --> 01:10:10.702
I told you.

01:10:12.913 --> 01:10:14.873
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:10:44.153 --> 01:10:46.113
Evelyn.

01:10:46.238 --> 01:10:48.240
Max.

01:10:49.032 --> 01:10:51.118
I've been worried sick.

01:10:51.243 --> 01:10:55.539
I... I was working. I told you.

01:10:55.956 --> 01:10:59.042
I called. No one answered.

01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:03.422
Yeah, I was busy. I'm sorry.

01:11:04.047 --> 01:11:06.759
You changed your clothes.

01:11:06.884 --> 01:11:09.011
Oh, yeah. I...

01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:13.390
I spilled Karo syrup
all over them and...

01:11:13.474 --> 01:11:17.311
had to go to the dry cleaner
to pick these up.

01:11:17.394 --> 01:11:20.814
Did I... did I miss anything?

01:11:20.898 --> 01:11:24.067
- No.
- No?

01:11:24.818 --> 01:11:28.113
I ate dinner. Cleaned up.

01:11:28.822 --> 01:11:30.407
You ate dinner?

01:11:33.243 --> 01:11:34.912
But you're never hungry.

01:11:35.412 --> 01:11:37.664
Well...

01:11:37.748 --> 01:11:39.208
I got a craving.

01:11:41.418 --> 01:11:43.837
What did you do to him, Ev?

01:11:44.755 --> 01:11:46.173
- Where is he?
- Max.

01:11:46.298 --> 01:11:47.424
Ev.

01:11:51.303 --> 01:11:53.764
You ate Travis?

01:11:55.099 --> 01:11:57.684
You ate my brother.

01:11:57.768 --> 01:12:00.437
Half brother, Max.

01:12:00.562 --> 01:12:02.898
And the lesser half if you ask me.

01:12:04.191 --> 01:12:06.985
We were family.

01:12:07.903 --> 01:12:09.822
I am your family now.

01:12:10.239 --> 01:12:15.119
He was a user and a loser.
Actually, he didn't even taste good.

01:12:17.663 --> 01:12:20.040
I can't believe you did this.

01:12:20.165 --> 01:12:22.626
No more games, Max.

01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:27.423
You promised me that we would
be together forever. It's time.

01:12:28.549 --> 01:12:33.178
I promise. It won't hurt that much.

01:12:33.804 --> 01:12:36.056
You're right.

01:12:36.473 --> 01:12:39.643
No more games. Let's do this.

01:12:40.811 --> 01:12:42.938
But...

01:12:44.731 --> 01:12:47.317
- Not here.
- Where?

01:12:47.734 --> 01:12:49.862
Why don't you run a...

01:12:49.987 --> 01:12:54.741
run a bath and I'll meet you
there in a sec?

01:12:58.745 --> 01:13:02.416
And why don't you make it hot.
Nice and hot.

01:13:03.542 --> 01:13:05.169
With bubbles.

01:13:27.483 --> 01:13:30.694
Come on, baby.
Got some serious bubbles waiting.

01:13:30.819 --> 01:13:35.574
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm just...
doing a little man-scaping.

01:13:48.921 --> 01:13:53.550
- <i>911. What's your emergency?</i>
- Hi, I'd like to report a homicide.

01:13:53.675 --> 01:13:57.596
Bear with me because this is gonna sound
really, really, really, really weird,

01:13:57.721 --> 01:14:01.308
but my girlfriend came back from the dead
and then she ate my brother

01:14:01.433 --> 01:14:03.977
and now she's gonna eat me.

01:14:04.728 --> 01:14:06.980
Hello?

01:14:07.106 --> 01:14:09.108
Shit.

01:14:10.901 --> 01:14:14.321
Hurry up, Max.
The water is getting cold.

01:14:15.197 --> 01:14:19.660
Coming. Just... doing my taint.

01:14:51.275 --> 01:14:54.027
Max, where are you?

01:14:57.865 --> 01:15:01.160
I thought you were done
playing games, Max.

01:15:02.369 --> 01:15:04.705
Max!

01:15:45.579 --> 01:15:47.748
Hello?

01:15:48.165 --> 01:15:50.334
Can someone please help me?

01:15:50.459 --> 01:15:53.921
Goddamn it. Hold your horses.

01:15:54.004 --> 01:15:57.591
Been on the john. What's the ruckus?

01:15:57.674 --> 01:16:00.260
You may want to sit down first, sir.

01:16:13.607 --> 01:16:18.779
Hey, the entrance is on the other side,
but we're closed right now, okay?

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.836
Trick or treat, smell my feet,

01:16:33.919 --> 01:16:37.047
give me something good to eat.

01:16:37.131 --> 01:16:40.676
I said we're closed right now.
Are you deaf?

01:16:50.811 --> 01:16:54.356
Hey, cool costume.

01:16:56.191 --> 01:16:58.485
Give me candy,

01:16:58.569 --> 01:17:00.654
give me cake,

01:17:00.737 --> 01:17:03.532
give me something sweet to take.

01:17:04.491 --> 01:17:06.493
What are you?

01:17:06.618 --> 01:17:09.538
I am resurrected!

01:17:14.918 --> 01:17:17.212
Are you pulling my pickle, sonny boy?

01:17:17.337 --> 01:17:22.092
No, goddamn it.
This is actually happening right now.

01:17:22.176 --> 01:17:23.719
Are you on meth?

01:17:23.844 --> 01:17:28.682
No sir, now can you please
send a squad car to my apartment,

01:17:28.766 --> 01:17:31.685
preferably with officers
that shoot really, really well?

01:17:31.769 --> 01:17:33.103
<i>Attention all units.</i>

01:17:33.187 --> 01:17:37.691
<i>Breaking and entering in a malt shop
on the corner of Melrose and Heliotrope.</i>

01:17:38.358 --> 01:17:41.236
What kind of idiot
knocks over a malt shop?

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.781
Schmuck knocks over a malt shop.

01:17:43.864 --> 01:17:44.948
Olivia.

01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:48.994
Goddamn meth heads.

01:17:53.457 --> 01:17:55.584
Olivia!

01:18:00.547 --> 01:18:03.425
Goddamn it, Evelyn.

01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:14.978
You think you can just come in
and steal my boyfriend

01:18:15.062 --> 01:18:16.563
and nothing's gonna happen to you?

01:18:16.688 --> 01:18:19.316
- Evelyn!
- Max!

01:18:19.441 --> 01:18:22.486
You let her go.
This is between you and me.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:26.740
You cheated on me... with her.

01:18:26.865 --> 01:18:30.828
It's not like that, Ev. Now let her go
and I'll explain everything.

01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:33.664
You broke my heart, Max.

01:18:33.789 --> 01:18:37.668
I know, Ev,
but it's not beating anymore.

01:18:38.168 --> 01:18:40.295
Now, let her go.
I'm not gonna ask again.

01:18:40.421 --> 01:18:43.715
What the hell is going on, Max?

01:18:43.799 --> 01:18:47.344
Olivia, this is Evelyn,

01:18:47.428 --> 01:18:50.514
my dead ex-girlfriend.

01:18:50.973 --> 01:18:54.309
What? This...

01:18:54.393 --> 01:18:59.606
You know, I met you before
and you were a bitch then,

01:18:59.690 --> 01:19:01.900
and you're even a bigger bitch now.

01:19:02.276 --> 01:19:04.194
Evelyn! Enough.

01:19:04.319 --> 01:19:08.157
- We were happy together Max.
- We weren't. We weren't, Ev.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:13.537
I wasn't for a very long time.
It's my fault. I should have ended it.

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:18.333
Now, let her go and we can
break up for real this time.

01:19:19.042 --> 01:19:20.794
I don't understand.

01:19:20.878 --> 01:19:24.339
Evelyn, we weren't meant to be together.

01:19:24.423 --> 01:19:25.466
Why?

01:19:25.591 --> 01:19:30.888
You would never be happy with me
because I would never be happy.

01:19:31.722 --> 01:19:33.807
Now, it's time to go, Ev.

01:19:33.932 --> 01:19:36.643
It's time to be with your mom.

01:19:36.727 --> 01:19:38.854
Okay.

01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:42.483
But I'm taking you with me.

01:19:55.746 --> 01:19:57.831
Oh, my God, that's so gross.

01:20:13.263 --> 01:20:15.349
Olivia!

01:20:36.161 --> 01:20:39.623
- You won't regret this, baby.
- Not on the runner.

01:20:39.748 --> 01:20:42.709
- What?
- Not on the runner.

01:20:42.835 --> 01:20:46.171
Not on the runner. Not on the runner.

01:20:58.559 --> 01:20:59.977
Max!

01:21:08.569 --> 01:21:10.904
Can't we just go back
to the way things were?

01:21:11.655 --> 01:21:15.701
- You're dead to me.
- In the brain, Max, in the brain!

01:21:22.416 --> 01:21:24.960
You asshole.

01:21:33.927 --> 01:21:35.679
- Are you okay?
- Are you?

01:21:35.763 --> 01:21:38.974
Yeah. Okay.

01:21:41.477 --> 01:21:45.105
- Olivia, I'm...
- Max! Max!

01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:47.524
You can't get rid of me that easily!

01:21:48.901 --> 01:21:53.405
It's over, you stupid zombie bitch!

01:22:05.793 --> 01:22:08.253
Oh, shit.

01:22:09.379 --> 01:22:12.257
Now I'm gonna kill you.

01:22:13.133 --> 01:22:14.301
Both of you.

01:22:20.015 --> 01:22:21.850
Travis!

01:22:21.975 --> 01:22:24.520
That's right, woman.

01:22:25.771 --> 01:22:28.065
Mother...

01:22:32.277 --> 01:22:36.573
- I thought you were dead.
- Well, I'm back.

01:22:37.574 --> 01:22:38.951
Oh, God.

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.331
Who are you?

01:22:44.456 --> 01:22:48.252
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Travis.

01:22:49.169 --> 01:22:53.924
Yeah, I'm sorry. Olivia, this is Travis.
Travis, this is Olivia.

01:22:54.007 --> 01:22:55.801
Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

01:22:55.926 --> 01:22:58.637
Jesus Christ, Max.
How many zombies do you know?

01:22:58.762 --> 01:23:01.056
Just these two, really.

01:23:01.890 --> 01:23:03.434
So...

01:23:04.393 --> 01:23:06.854
what do we do now?

01:23:06.979 --> 01:23:09.064
Bury your ex.

01:23:27.624 --> 01:23:31.211
Olivia, I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about this sooner.

01:23:31.295 --> 01:23:34.923
I really wanted to. I just...

01:23:35.048 --> 01:23:36.842
I didn't know how.

01:23:36.925 --> 01:23:41.555
And if you just let me,
I promise I will prove to you...

01:23:46.977 --> 01:23:50.189
Let's bury her and get out of here.

01:23:50.272 --> 01:23:53.567
- All right.
- Okay.

01:24:02.576 --> 01:24:05.037
Good bye, Evelyn.

01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:12.086
Here you go.

01:24:13.337 --> 01:24:16.006
Stay cool, guys.

01:24:17.966 --> 01:24:20.427
I'll be right with you.

01:24:22.346 --> 01:24:24.515
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.726
Thank you, have a hell of a day.

01:24:27.810 --> 01:24:29.812
Hey.

01:24:30.771 --> 01:24:33.440
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:24:35.192 --> 01:24:38.028
- How's biz?
- It's not bad. You?

01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:42.699
It is so good it's scary.

01:24:42.783 --> 01:24:46.036
Really? Well, then why are you late
on this month's rent?

01:24:46.912 --> 01:24:49.540
Because I...

01:24:49.665 --> 01:24:52.459
I spent all my money...

01:24:53.377 --> 01:24:55.963
on this.

01:25:01.802 --> 01:25:05.681
Well, what do you think?

01:25:07.224 --> 01:25:11.687
Max, my love, I think we're gonna
make great partners.

01:25:17.484 --> 01:25:21.405
Now, if only you could get
your brother to settle down.

01:25:22.448 --> 01:25:26.160
Welcome to Max and Olivia's
Cream-atorium.

01:25:27.578 --> 01:25:30.456
Hey, baby, you ever bang a zombie?

01:25:30.581 --> 01:25:34.835
Once you go undead, it's never
been better in bed. Just sayin'!

01:29:11.635 --> 01:29:13.595
Go.

01:29:20.018 --> 01:29:21.353
Cut.

01:29:21.437 --> 01:29:24.523
- Gross!
- Oh, fuck!

01:29:25.983 --> 01:29:28.777
I was gonna fucking throw up.
