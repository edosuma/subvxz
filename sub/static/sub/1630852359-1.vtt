[Money for Nothing
by Dire Straits]
* MTV... *

00:07.408 --> 00:10.744
Elsa: I remember
the first time I saw it.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.914
Tried to find words
to describe it...

00:13.981 --> 00:16.250
[wind rustling]
but I couldn't.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.456
Nothing had prepared me...

00:22.523 --> 00:28.028
no books, no teachers,
not even my parents.

00:32.166 --> 00:38.706
I heard a thousand stories but
none could describe this place.

00:38.772 --> 00:42.743
It must be witnessed
to be understood.

00:42.810 --> 00:49.117
And yet... I've seen it,
and understand it even less

00:49.183 --> 00:52.220
than before I first
cast eyes on this place.

00:52.286 --> 00:55.123
[music]

00:58.392 --> 01:01.862
Some call it
the American Desert,

01:01.929 --> 01:05.633
others, the Great Plains.

01:05.699 --> 01:09.903
But those phrases were invented
by professors at universities

01:09.970 --> 01:13.073
surrounded by the illusion
of order

01:13.141 --> 01:17.578
and the fantasy
of right and wrong.

01:17.645 --> 01:21.749
To know it, you must walk it.

01:21.815 --> 01:25.052
Bleed into its dirt.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.688
Drown in its rivers.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.124
Then its name becomes clear

01:30.191 --> 01:32.426
[fire burning]

01:32.493 --> 01:34.662
It is hell,

01:34.728 --> 01:38.866
and there are demons
everywhere.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.235
[panting]

01:41.302 --> 01:44.104
[music]

02:13.701 --> 02:15.703
[rumbling]

02:17.238 --> 02:19.873
[war cries]

02:22.510 --> 02:24.812
[screams]

02:30.083 --> 02:32.586
[crying]

02:32.653 --> 02:34.755
[Woman screams]

02:57.044 --> 02:58.212
[war cries]

02:59.580 --> 03:01.682
[panting]

03:11.259 --> 03:14.528
Warrior: I said no.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.630
- Will you let me go?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.766
- I will sell you.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.434
Or I will kill you!

03:20.501 --> 03:23.904
- You speak English.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.339
How can you do this?!

03:25.406 --> 03:30.043
- You speak English.
And no, your people did this.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.813
- [grunts]

03:32.880 --> 03:34.848
[gasps]

03:38.419 --> 03:42.055
Elsa: But if this is hell,
and I'm in it...

03:42.122 --> 03:44.958
[gunshots]
then I must be a demon too.

03:46.927 --> 03:47.928
And I'm already dead.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.129
[Elsa screams]

03:49.196 --> 03:51.799
[music]

04:57.431 --> 05:00.167
[wind blowing]

05:54.955 --> 05:57.024
[sobbing]

06:05.599 --> 06:10.738
[deep breaths]

06:30.724 --> 06:33.561
[music]

06:41.935 --> 06:44.905
[sobbing]

07:01.321 --> 07:02.355
[sniffs]

07:11.064 --> 07:14.267
[music]

07:25.479 --> 07:26.847
[sniffs]

07:42.596 --> 07:45.098
[sobbing]

08:02.516 --> 08:05.653
[music]

09:39.346 --> 09:40.748
- Captain.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.217
- Yeah.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.055
- We're ready.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.389
[music]

09:54.194 --> 09:55.328
You coming?

09:58.866 --> 10:00.367
- I'm thinking about it.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.972
- Think on it quick.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.307
If I'm digging a hole,

10:07.374 --> 10:09.309
I'd rather do it
before the sun's high.

10:20.487 --> 10:21.521
- I'm coming.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.657
[music]

10:52.820 --> 10:55.555
[carriage rolling]

10:57.390 --> 10:58.926
[gunfire]

10:59.659 --> 11:03.797
[music]

11:03.864 --> 11:04.898
- Come on!

11:13.707 --> 11:18.311
[music]

11:33.460 --> 11:34.661
Whoa!

11:46.073 --> 11:47.074
Ya!

11:51.678 --> 11:53.013
Ya!

11:55.115 --> 11:57.951
- Pretty smart.
- They won't fall for it again.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.055
Pretty soon they'll
just shoot the horses.

12:02.122 --> 12:06.093
- Horses is probably
what they're after.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.595
Farmers ain't got
nuthin' else worth taking.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.298
- They'll shoot
the horses anyway.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.365
Then the farmer.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.336
- Ya!

12:26.746 --> 12:27.848
Ya!

12:48.201 --> 12:50.203
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.039
I don't give a shit.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.379
[gunshot]

13:00.680 --> 13:01.714
[gunshot]

13:03.083 --> 13:04.751
[booming gunshot]

13:32.045 --> 13:33.947
- Good shot.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.415
- Yep.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.616
[clicks tongue]

13:46.226 --> 13:47.460
[horse nickers]

14:18.425 --> 14:20.027
- So y'all just sat up
there and watched?

14:20.093 --> 14:22.395
- You looked like
you had it figured.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.164
- Well, thanks
for the fucking help.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.268
Don't take the horse.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.870
- Well, I figure I earned it.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.440
- Thieves run in pretty
big packs around here.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.009
If one of his pack sees it...

14:36.076 --> 14:38.278
You'd just be advertising
for the next gunfight.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.254
[clicks tongue]

14:48.688 --> 14:53.626
[music]

15:39.072 --> 15:40.407
[sigh]

15:49.116 --> 15:52.285
[deep breaths]

15:57.657 --> 16:01.028
[music]

16:45.338 --> 16:49.042
[music continues]

17:05.425 --> 17:08.528
Man: Come one, come all!
I've got an Indian scalp
today for sale.

17:08.595 --> 17:09.896
The genuine article!

17:09.962 --> 17:16.203
Comanche! Kiowa! Kickapoo!
Scalps! For sale today!

17:16.269 --> 17:18.971
- Linson's magic elixir
cures consumption...

17:19.038 --> 17:20.607
- $10.

17:21.408 --> 17:25.078
[music]

17:34.821 --> 17:36.956
[shouting]

18:03.683 --> 18:05.585
- Whoa.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.188
[indistinct chatter]

18:14.827 --> 18:15.995
Man: Try and figure it out.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.786
- Can you take a wagon
and a team?

18:39.852 --> 18:41.221
- How many in your team?

18:41.288 --> 18:43.290
- Four. And I had two
shipped here by train.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.624
A yellow and a buckskin.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.526
- Yellow and buckskin.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.428
You James Dutton?
- Yep.

18:48.495 --> 18:49.862
We got them in back.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.766
Most keep
their wagons out back.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.602
See what you got here.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.537
Excuse us.
- Excuse us, gentlemen.

19:00.773 --> 19:01.941
- [laughs]

19:02.008 --> 19:04.277
Hey, all this shit'll be
stolen by morning.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.979
- You ain't go no place
you can keep it?

19:07.046 --> 19:09.682
- I'll keep it in the hay
barn for ten dollars.

19:09.749 --> 19:10.950
Of course, can't make
no promises

19:11.017 --> 19:12.185
it won't get
robbed there either.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.921
- Well, it's the promise
I'm paying for.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.757
- For twenty, I'll have
someone sit with it.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.158
- And how much for the horses?

19:19.226 --> 19:21.628
- Two apiece.
- All right.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.363
There a decent hotel?

19:23.430 --> 19:25.131
- Just yourself?

19:25.198 --> 19:27.200
- Got my family.
Six total.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.136
- Yeah.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.438
You don't want
your family here.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.839
You should go to Dallas.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.608
- Well, here's where
they're meeting me.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.445
- Best bet's the Calhoun.
- All right.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.280
- You're 77, 78, 79...

19:40.347 --> 19:43.483
81 and 82 for
the two already here.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.817
For the wagon.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.986
If you ain't settled
up in thirty days,

19:47.053 --> 19:48.988
everything goes to auction.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.357
[coins hit table]

19:50.423 --> 19:51.758
- What's the rule
about firearms in this town?

19:51.824 --> 19:53.726
- This place'll pick you
apart if you ain't got one.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.664
But if you pull your pistol
in this town, mister...

19:57.730 --> 19:58.798
You'd better know how to use it.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.417
[cheering]

20:27.226 --> 20:29.095
Woman: Hey, handsome!

20:29.161 --> 20:32.164
Woman #2: Is it my lucky day?

20:32.231 --> 20:35.568
Come on in
for a shower and bath.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.070
Hell, I might let you bathe me.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.841
- Forget about the bath, baby.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.812
You can come climb mama
like a tree.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.580
- Watch where the hell
you're going.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.885
- Give it back.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.054
- Give what back?

20:55.121 --> 20:57.857
- My wallet.
- I didn't take your fucking--

21:05.332 --> 21:08.401
[music]

21:21.481 --> 21:23.149
Pickpocket!

21:23.215 --> 21:24.817
[shouting, clamoring]

21:52.545 --> 21:54.947
- Put that back!
- He took my goddamn wallet.

21:55.014 --> 21:59.719
[clamoring]

22:17.637 --> 22:22.008
[gunshots]

22:29.816 --> 22:32.519
- Farmer ain't scared
to use that shotgun.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.422
- Farmer's gonna pick a fight
he can't win before long.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.260
[indistinct chatter]

22:54.907 --> 22:56.409
Thomas, stand by that door.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.878
Don't let any of that
bullshit spill in here.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.317
That should answer
any questions

23:05.384 --> 23:08.888
about how dangerous
this journey will be.

23:08.955 --> 23:12.324
It will be that and worse,
all the way to Oregon.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.661
[speaking German]

23:18.931 --> 23:20.433
Does anybody speak English?

23:27.474 --> 23:28.908
- I...

23:31.911 --> 23:33.646
I speak English.
Josef.

23:35.047 --> 23:37.116
- Does this group have a leader?

23:40.787 --> 23:44.023
[speaking German]

23:46.158 --> 23:49.128
But he doesn't speak English.

23:49.195 --> 23:50.830
[speaking German]

23:51.998 --> 23:54.701
- No. No English.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.335
- You have wagons?

23:56.402 --> 23:58.538
- And ox to pull them.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.239
- Ox...

24:00.306 --> 24:02.041
Ox won't make the trip.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.477
Heat and no water
will kill them.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.913
Sell the ox.
Get horses.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.481
- We don't know horses.

24:12.752 --> 24:13.786
- Where's your gear?

24:16.255 --> 24:17.724
- Gear?

24:17.790 --> 24:19.659
- Your supplies.

24:19.726 --> 24:22.261
Your suitcases.
What you take with you.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.096
- In the room.
In--in the back.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.665
- Show me.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.269
[speaking German]

24:45.417 --> 24:47.053
What is all this shit?

24:49.121 --> 24:51.457
- Everything we
brought from home.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.526
- Well, you should
have left it there.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.995
It won't make the trip.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.329
- It must.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.065
This is everything we have.

24:59.131 --> 25:02.134
- How am I supposed
to load this on a wagon

25:02.201 --> 25:04.971
and float it across
the fucking river?

25:05.037 --> 25:06.873
And over mountains?

25:06.939 --> 25:10.577
- Captain.
He ain't even got a pistol.

25:10.643 --> 25:11.978
- No.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.846
- Against your religion?

25:13.913 --> 25:17.183
- Against our laws.
We were not allowed.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.251
- None of you have firearms?

25:21.453 --> 25:23.122
- Do we need them?

25:23.189 --> 25:25.692
[laughs]

25:25.758 --> 25:29.395
- Do you need them?

25:29.461 --> 25:31.864
We're going to have
to hire more men.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.266
To protect you.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.768
To help you hunt for food.

25:35.835 --> 25:39.138
Talk it over with your group
and see what kind of money

25:39.205 --> 25:41.140
they can come up with so
we can hire them.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.842
- More money...

25:42.909 --> 25:45.544
The price is
two hundred per family.

25:45.612 --> 25:47.880
- There's a new price.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.516
- The church warned us
about people like you.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.586
You change rules.
You... You try to rob us.

25:53.653 --> 25:56.823
You think we're fools,
just because--

25:56.889 --> 25:58.424
- You have no horses.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.860
No guns.
You can't ride.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.995
You are a fucking fool!

26:03.062 --> 26:05.264
For thinking you can
travel two thousand miles

26:05.331 --> 26:07.566
with no skills to survive it.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.102
- Captain.

26:10.169 --> 26:15.407
[music]

26:15.474 --> 26:16.508
[gags]

26:22.214 --> 26:24.651
- Take the train to Portland.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.653
You won't make this trip.

26:26.719 --> 26:29.321
- We...
We can't afford the train.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.724
- Then I suggest you
buy farms around here.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.459
- Here is hot.
Here is dry.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.527
We come from mountains.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.663
Mountains we know.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.069
[speaking German]

26:44.303 --> 26:46.205
How much do more men cost?

26:47.439 --> 26:48.574
- Maybe a hundred apiece.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.543
Maybe more.
Let me check around.

26:54.113 --> 26:58.985
- Okay. We... we leave
in the morning?

26:59.051 --> 27:00.853
- We leave when you're ready

27:00.920 --> 27:02.889
and you won't be ready
in the morning.

27:06.893 --> 27:07.960
- All is okay.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.362
[music]

27:29.682 --> 27:32.685
[music]

27:47.466 --> 27:50.236
- You're staring out that window
like there's a prize to be had.

27:51.938 --> 27:53.272
You ain't half-wrong.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.642
- Never seen a sunset.

27:56.709 --> 27:59.378
- Sun don't set
where you're from?

27:59.445 --> 28:00.579
- The pine trees block it.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.515
- Tennessee...

28:03.582 --> 28:05.551
- How'd you know?

28:05.617 --> 28:08.154
- I know the pines.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.389
And I know the accent.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.258
Where you headed?

28:12.324 --> 28:14.293
- West.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.661
- All by yourself?

28:15.728 --> 28:17.764
- With my family.

28:17.830 --> 28:21.400
- I don't see much family.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.534
Just see you...

28:24.771 --> 28:25.772
- They're, um...

28:28.741 --> 28:31.210
Our seats are in the back.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.845
I just wanted to
look out the window so I--

28:32.912 --> 28:34.747
- Sit here as long as you like.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.783
Then just a little bit longer...

28:41.120 --> 28:43.489
I question your
father's judgment, though.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.992
If had a daughter
as pretty as you,

28:46.058 --> 28:47.994
she would never leave my sight.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.299
Don't do that.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.734
Don't hide from it.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.737
Beauty is meant to be admired.

29:06.779 --> 29:07.980
Let me look...

29:13.953 --> 29:15.221
Yeah.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.557
Look at you.

29:23.195 --> 29:24.130
Ah!

29:24.196 --> 29:25.364
All right, ma'am...

29:25.431 --> 29:27.366
Ma'am, I get your point, ma'am.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.367
All right, ma'am.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.902
- Elsa, let's go.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.707
Good day to you, sir.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.276
You're going to be
the death of me, I swear.

29:37.343 --> 29:38.677
- I was just looking
out the window.

29:38.744 --> 29:41.747
- Mm-hmm.
Window sure wears a fancy suit.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.384
- Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.686
Oh, excuse me.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.455
Excuse me, sir.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.523
- Where's John?
- With your aunt.

29:51.590 --> 29:55.161
- You left him with them?
- YOU left me no choice.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.863
Sit.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.135
- Someday I'll only ride
in the front of the train.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.571
- [scoffs]
- That's a child's goal.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.574
A woman's goal is never
ride a train again

30:08.640 --> 30:11.143
because she has a home
she never wants to leave.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.545
- I guess we're both
a ways from our goal.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.751
- Ought not let her
talk to you like that.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.220
If she were my daughter...

30:21.287 --> 30:23.555
- If you think you can
make her listen, be my guest.

30:24.857 --> 30:25.858
[gasps]

30:25.925 --> 30:27.293
- Traipse off into harm's way

30:27.359 --> 30:29.428
and then back-talk your
mother for saving you?

30:29.495 --> 30:31.530
- I wasn't in harm's--
[gasps]

30:31.597 --> 30:33.799
I'm sorry.
Ah!

30:33.866 --> 30:36.903
- It didn't worry me.
You apologize to her.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.438
- I'm sorry, Mama.
Tell her to stop.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.806
- You proved your point.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.009
- You'll hit a stranger,
but not your own daughter,

30:43.075 --> 30:44.576
when it's exactly
what she needs.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.112
[sobbing]

30:48.114 --> 30:50.782
Spare the rod, Margaret,
and the freedom will ruin her.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.451
If it hasn't already.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.188
[sniffs]

30:56.255 --> 30:57.689
- You had it coming.

31:00.359 --> 31:05.864
[music]

31:22.448 --> 31:23.882
[piano playing]

31:26.218 --> 31:27.987
[indistinct chatter]

31:30.422 --> 31:32.558
- How's the pay?
- Hundred a month.

31:34.693 --> 31:36.228
- It'll take four months
to get there,

31:36.295 --> 31:38.597
then we're stuck in Oregon
for the winter.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.632
We'll burn through the money
waiting to get home.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.501
- We can send you
back on the train.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.440
- Look, Captain...

31:48.507 --> 31:50.642
I've pushed cattle
all the way to Omaha

31:50.709 --> 31:52.911
and come across a fair amount
of these immigrant wagons:

31:52.979 --> 31:55.347
these sons of bitches
are trying to die.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.517
They can't swim.
They can't ride.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.020
Bandits gonna plague you
all the way to Nebraska

32:01.087 --> 32:03.589
and when you get to
the Indian country...whew!

32:03.655 --> 32:05.724
- Indians are on reservations.

32:05.791 --> 32:08.494
- They're on reservations
till they ain't.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.229
And when they see you
coming 'round the bend,

32:10.296 --> 32:13.065
they gonna saddle up
and pluck y'all like chickens.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.700
- Mm-hmm.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.235
- It's dangerous
enough around here.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.404
I ain't gotta go two thousand
miles looking for trouble.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.672
All the trouble I'll ever need
is right outside that door.

32:25.011 --> 32:26.478
Thank you for supper.

32:26.545 --> 32:27.946
- Mm-hmm.

32:39.825 --> 32:42.328
- We could have
a look in The Elephant.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.296
- If they're in The Elephant
when we find 'em,

32:44.363 --> 32:46.165
I don't want 'em.

32:55.507 --> 32:56.908
Look who it is.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.082
- That farmer's
everywhere at once, ain't he?

33:04.083 --> 33:05.084
- Mm-hmm.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.434
- Mind if we speak?

33:22.501 --> 33:24.070
- Whatever you're selling
I ain't buying.

33:25.871 --> 33:27.506
- Mind if we speak?

33:36.115 --> 33:39.185
For your supper.
For the intrusion.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.786
- I can pay for my own dinner.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.290
- Four horses to your wagon.
What are you hauling?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.459
Moving pretty fast.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.362
My guess, it's empty and
you're filling her up in town.

33:50.429 --> 33:51.863
Then headed...

33:56.068 --> 33:58.570
- Mister, if we wanted
to rob you

33:58.637 --> 34:00.372
we'd have done it
long before now.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.810
We're leading
a wagon train north.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.745
Figured you might be
headed the same way.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.617
We could use some
capable men with us.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.085
And you seem to be that.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.623
- That's all we're asking.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.759
- My family's meeting
me here tonight.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.261
We're headed up north tomorrow.

34:22.328 --> 34:25.597
- North where?
- Don't know.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.767
- You don't strike me as a man
who travels without a plan.

34:28.834 --> 34:30.136
- I got a plan.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.341
[chuckles]

34:35.407 --> 34:39.845
- You will make a man work
for an answer, won't you?

34:39.911 --> 34:42.281
- I ain't got the answer myself.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.683
You got all these folks
hauling ass

34:44.750 --> 34:47.085
west and north and they ain't
never even seen the country

34:47.153 --> 34:48.987
and they don't even know if
it's worth the journey.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.689
Not me.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.391
I'm gonna keep heading north

34:52.458 --> 34:54.493
till I find land
that's worth the journey.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.062
- How many in your group?

34:57.129 --> 34:58.964
- Six.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.432
- How many men?

35:05.237 --> 35:06.472
We could help each other.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.075
- I ain't looking for help.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.777
I'm worried enough
about my own family

35:11.843 --> 35:16.014
to be worrying about
somebody else's.

35:16.081 --> 35:17.749
- You got lucky in that field.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.653
You got lucky on the street.

35:21.720 --> 35:25.291
Hope you got enough luck left
for those coming with you.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.500
[music]

35:47.413 --> 35:51.717
[door squeaks]

35:51.783 --> 35:53.084
[bell ringing]

35:53.151 --> 35:55.521
- Next, stop, Fort Worth.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.024
Next, stop, Fort Worth.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.127
- Elsa!

36:02.194 --> 36:03.762
- I'm just looking outside.

36:06.164 --> 36:10.969
[music]

36:11.036 --> 36:12.704
[train whistle blows]

36:23.382 --> 36:26.117
- The air was different.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.688
The air at home is heavy,
like a musky soup.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.590
Here it is light.

36:31.657 --> 36:33.559
With a strange scent
of pollen and smoke,

36:33.625 --> 36:36.428
like burning flowers...

36:36.495 --> 36:39.898
It smelled wild.
Untamed.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.333
It was beautiful.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.271
[music]

37:20.038 --> 37:22.240
[steam hisses]

37:34.953 --> 37:37.623
- Just wait for
everyone to get off.

37:38.657 --> 37:39.825
- Have you seen Elsa?

37:41.560 --> 37:43.028
- You lost her again.

37:44.563 --> 37:45.664
[sighs]

37:48.734 --> 37:52.671
- If "possible" can describe
a feeling, that's how I felt.

37:52.738 --> 37:56.274
The whole world felt possible.

37:56.342 --> 37:57.876
And I was ready for it.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.951
- Daddy!

38:07.152 --> 38:09.688
Daddy! Daddy!

38:09.755 --> 38:11.457
Daddy!

38:11.523 --> 38:12.758
- How did you get up there?

38:12.824 --> 38:14.125
- There's a door.

38:14.192 --> 38:16.595
- Well, then go back through it.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.365
- Too many people now.
I have to wait.

38:19.431 --> 38:20.866
[exhales]

38:20.932 --> 38:22.167
Oh, I can't wait.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.374
- Oh my God.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.775
- Be careful.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.543
- Woo!

38:31.610 --> 38:32.811
- Come here.
- [giggling]

38:32.878 --> 38:35.180
Oh.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.415
[scoffs]

38:38.049 --> 38:39.385
- Ah!

38:39.451 --> 38:40.619
If you don't stop growing
I'm gonna stack bricks

38:40.686 --> 38:42.087
on your head.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.322
- You need a shave, Daddy.
Mama's gonna throw a fit.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.057
- She might like it.
- [laughs]

38:49.127 --> 38:50.429
- That girl...

38:50.496 --> 38:51.630
How did you get down here?

38:54.866 --> 38:56.635
- I jumped.

38:56.702 --> 38:59.304
- She is your daughter
and you can have her.

39:04.275 --> 39:06.845
- Hey, babe.
I missed you.

39:06.912 --> 39:09.114
- You look like a ruffian.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.916
- I was planning on a shave.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.350
- You should've planned harder.

39:12.418 --> 39:15.120
- I'll get one
first thing tomorrow.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.489
- Well...
It's okay for now.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.927
- Well, it looks like you
survived the journey.

39:21.993 --> 39:23.261
- Barely.

39:23.328 --> 39:25.697
The man beside me shit hisself
in Mississippi

39:25.764 --> 39:28.600
and I had to smell it
all the way here.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.503
James: That doesn't sound like
a whole lot of fun.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.672
- James, your children
are feral.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.541
Absolutely feral.

39:35.607 --> 39:38.877
- Hello, Claire.
- Hi.

39:38.944 --> 39:40.946
Sorry to hear about Henry.

39:41.012 --> 39:43.549
He was...

39:43.615 --> 39:45.050
A patient man.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.885
- Nothing to be sorry about.

39:46.952 --> 39:48.420
It's the Lord's will.

39:48.487 --> 39:52.658
Can't believe in heaven then
be sad when people go there.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.759
- Yes, ma'am.

39:53.825 --> 39:57.128
[dog barks in distance]

39:59.865 --> 40:00.932
[sniffs]

40:00.999 --> 40:03.535
James: Mary Abel.

40:03.602 --> 40:04.670
Claire.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.372
- Thank you.

40:07.439 --> 40:08.974
- Elsa.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.443
Elsa.

40:14.946 --> 40:17.348
This is a dangerous town.
I don't want you to wander.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.685
- I don't wander.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.919
- Honey, that's all you do,
is wander,

40:20.986 --> 40:22.688
and I don't want
you doing it here.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.122
You promise me.

40:24.189 --> 40:26.291
- I promise.
- All right.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.427
- Baby.

40:29.495 --> 40:32.297
[music]

40:43.575 --> 40:45.076
- Calhoun.
- Yes, sir.

40:45.143 --> 40:46.144
[kissing noises]

40:58.857 --> 40:59.791
[clicks tongue]

40:59.858 --> 41:03.562
[shouting]
[punching]

41:03.629 --> 41:05.597
Woman: Whip his fucking ass!

41:05.664 --> 41:07.132
Eat dirt, you asshole.

41:07.198 --> 41:08.199
Get him!

41:08.266 --> 41:09.935
- What did she say?

41:10.001 --> 41:11.469
- Nothing, honey.

41:11.537 --> 41:13.939
Woman: You call me a whore
again, you son of a bitch.

41:15.641 --> 41:18.309
- You staying
in Fort Worth long?

41:18.376 --> 41:20.579
- Not if I can help it.

41:20.646 --> 41:24.049
- You know...
There's some real nice parts.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.785
You just ain't in one of 'em.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.620
- [clicks tongue]
- Yeah, I can see that.

41:35.026 --> 41:37.495
- Hotel Calhoun.

41:37.563 --> 41:39.364
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:49.908 --> 41:51.242
- Here we are.

41:52.544 --> 41:54.913
[music]

41:57.015 --> 41:58.617
[dog barking in distance]

42:27.078 --> 42:28.580
- Claire, this is you.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.354
- Mary Abel, let's go.

42:41.126 --> 42:42.994
[door closes, locks]

42:43.061 --> 42:45.163
- Losing her husband
didn't soften her much.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.666
- Hmph. You could soak that
woman in buttermilk

42:47.733 --> 42:50.836
for a month and
not even soften her a bit.

42:52.237 --> 42:54.439
- All right.
[door unlocks]

42:54.505 --> 42:56.474
John, this is
you and your sister.

42:58.443 --> 43:00.445
- Where are you?
- Right next door, son.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.383
- Look after your brother.
- I will.

43:05.450 --> 43:07.185
- Yes, ma'am.

43:07.252 --> 43:09.054
- I said I will.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.321
- I know what you said.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.557
What you didn't say
is "yes, ma'am."

43:12.624 --> 43:14.125
- Women don't say
that to each other.

43:14.192 --> 43:15.694
- Oh, so you're a woman now?

43:15.761 --> 43:17.328
- Aren't I?

43:18.697 --> 43:22.267
- Oh...[laughs]
That child...

43:22.333 --> 43:24.235
- She ain't wrong.

43:24.302 --> 43:26.838
- Oh, so you're ready
for her to start courting.

43:26.905 --> 43:29.040
- [laughs] Not a chance.
- Mm-hmm, that's what I thought.

43:30.075 --> 43:33.845
[music]

43:33.912 --> 43:36.682
[sighs]

43:36.748 --> 43:40.085
- How much did you
spend on this room?

43:40.151 --> 43:41.987
- It's the last room
we'll see for a while.

43:42.053 --> 43:43.454
You deserve it.

43:45.924 --> 43:48.593
- A bath.
- Imagine that.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.929
- I wonder if there's
hot water in the lobby.

43:50.996 --> 43:52.397
- There's hot water.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.132
- I read about a hotel
in New York

43:54.199 --> 43:56.902
where they pipe hot water
straight into the room.

43:56.968 --> 44:01.206
You turn a faucet on
and it comes right out.

44:01.272 --> 44:03.408
[laughs]
Can you imagine that?

44:03.474 --> 44:05.143
- For now, you're
gonna have to imagine me

44:05.210 --> 44:07.746
hauling buckets
of water up those stairs.

44:07.813 --> 44:10.381
- Mmm.

44:10.448 --> 44:13.051
Well... I can do that.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.021
- All right.

44:18.690 --> 44:19.825
I'll be right back.

44:22.260 --> 44:24.229
[clicks tongue]

44:24.295 --> 44:30.802
[door closes]
[sighs]

44:30.869 --> 44:32.403
[piano playing]

45:08.840 --> 45:10.375
- Absinthe?

45:10.441 --> 45:12.143
- Soda water.

45:12.210 --> 45:15.013
- Hm. I don't know this water.

45:15.080 --> 45:18.316
- You probably use it
to remove stains.

45:18.383 --> 45:20.118
- Why do you drink it?

45:20.185 --> 45:21.853
- Because I don't drink alcohol.

45:23.855 --> 45:25.857
- Why not?

45:25.924 --> 45:27.658
- Just don't.

45:28.994 --> 45:30.695
- You don't gamble either.

45:30.762 --> 45:32.397
- No.
- [chuckles]

45:34.432 --> 45:35.666
- Do you dance?

45:37.368 --> 45:39.237
- Not anymore.

45:39.304 --> 45:41.072
- Well, maybe you should
go home and sleep.

45:43.008 --> 45:45.676
Now let me guess:
you don't sleep either.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.712
- Not much.

45:47.779 --> 45:51.349
- So you sit here and drink
your drink that isn't a drink

45:51.416 --> 45:54.685
and you watch the people do all
the other things you don't do.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.521
- That's a fair observation.

45:59.057 --> 46:00.158
- Why?

46:01.793 --> 46:03.028
It's not money.

46:05.396 --> 46:07.665
Poor men stare
across this room

46:07.732 --> 46:11.269
like little puppies
hungry for scraps.

46:11.336 --> 46:14.739
But you...
You have money.

46:16.241 --> 46:17.675
- I have enough.

46:19.710 --> 46:21.980
- You don't want to be
alone with your memories.

46:22.047 --> 46:24.782
It's why you don't sleep.

46:24.850 --> 46:27.752
It's why you sit here until you
are too tired for memories.

46:28.987 --> 46:31.389
- You're too smart
to be working here.

46:31.456 --> 46:32.891
- I make more money
than bankers.

46:32.958 --> 46:34.525
- [chuckles]

46:36.794 --> 46:38.463
I'm right where
I'm supposed to be.

46:43.734 --> 46:45.070
What was her name?

46:54.379 --> 46:55.413
- Helen.

47:12.197 --> 47:13.831
[music]

47:18.937 --> 47:20.371
- You've known no one since?

47:25.676 --> 47:27.412
You can call me her name.

47:31.682 --> 47:34.152
You can close your eyes

47:34.219 --> 47:36.821
and you can call me her name

47:36.888 --> 47:38.189
and you can be with her again.

47:41.759 --> 47:43.394
I can give that to you--

47:43.461 --> 47:45.163
- Get the fuck off me.

47:46.431 --> 47:48.199
- Is he causing you problems?

47:48.266 --> 47:49.600
- He pushed me.

47:56.341 --> 47:57.775
- You know what I'm doing here?

48:00.545 --> 48:03.181
Looking for a reason.

48:03.248 --> 48:05.383
You want to be my reason?

48:05.450 --> 48:06.918
- No, I do not.

48:06.985 --> 48:08.653
- Then sit the fuck down.

48:26.237 --> 48:27.238
Helen.

48:32.843 --> 48:34.212
Didn't work.

48:37.715 --> 48:40.518
[indistinct chatter]

48:40.585 --> 48:44.455
[piano plays
"Oh My Darling Clementine"]

49:00.471 --> 49:02.107
[laughing]

49:43.014 --> 49:46.051
- All I knew of sex was rumors.

49:46.117 --> 49:47.918
Stories traded among
friends as we tried

49:47.985 --> 49:50.688
to imagine what
that word really meant.

49:54.559 --> 49:55.626
Now I knew...

49:58.729 --> 50:01.232
- I've read a lot about Wyoming.

50:01.299 --> 50:06.271
- Well, there's not
enough rain in the east,

50:06.337 --> 50:08.806
there's too much snow
in the west.

50:08.873 --> 50:10.808
- So...

50:12.277 --> 50:14.312
No to Colorado...

50:18.916 --> 50:22.387
No to Wyoming.

50:23.921 --> 50:25.723
- Oregon.

50:25.790 --> 50:27.292
Washington.

50:27.358 --> 50:31.896
Plenty of rain.
Not much snow.

50:31.962 --> 50:34.732
Cool summers and mild winters.

50:34.799 --> 50:36.434
- Kind of sounds like a song.

50:37.835 --> 50:39.870
- To you it sounds like a song.

50:43.208 --> 50:44.542
- James...

50:44.609 --> 50:48.213
- You don't think that I hauled
40 gallons of water

50:48.279 --> 50:52.217
up those stairs just
to get clean?

50:53.418 --> 50:56.154
- [giggles]

50:56.221 --> 50:58.256
- I'm wooing you.

50:58.323 --> 51:02.327
[music]

51:02.393 --> 51:06.197
- Mm.

51:06.264 --> 51:10.535
Whoo, those buckets of water
sure must have been heavy.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.643
- They were, honey.
- Mm, poor thing.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.417
Woman: Woo!

51:30.221 --> 51:31.622
[moaning]

51:35.293 --> 51:37.362
- So much I don't
know about life.

51:38.529 --> 51:41.499
We learn to read,
we learn rules,

51:41.566 --> 51:43.134
learn scripture and manners,

51:43.201 --> 51:44.869
and how to avoid
saying or doing things

51:44.935 --> 51:46.704
that make others
uncomfortable.

51:48.473 --> 51:51.142
All those things seem
to be the opposite of life.

51:52.543 --> 51:55.313
Seem to strangle it.

51:55.380 --> 52:00.651
But now, I'm sleeping
on the edge of civilization,

52:00.718 --> 52:04.054
and soon
we leave the edge behind.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.424
Then no rules.

52:06.491 --> 52:08.092
Then, only life.

52:13.631 --> 52:14.932
What an adventure.

52:18.636 --> 52:20.371
What an adventure for
all of us...

55:58.789 --> 56:00.725

I gonna do with these?

56:00.791 --> 56:02.292
- Sell 'em.

56:02.359 --> 56:05.329
- To who?
- Farmers.

56:05.396 --> 56:07.432
- Farmers don't use ox no more.

56:07.498 --> 56:10.468
They got these steam engines now
that can pull a plow all day.

56:10.535 --> 56:12.202
All you gotta do
is feed the furnace.

56:12.269 --> 56:15.806
- Never seen one.
And neither have you.

56:15.873 --> 56:17.608
Swap me even.

56:17.675 --> 56:19.276
- I'll swap you for mules.

56:19.343 --> 56:20.845
- We need horses.

56:20.911 --> 56:23.113
- These folks can't
handle mules.

56:23.180 --> 56:25.583
They're real green.

56:25.650 --> 56:27.017
- Green's their problem.
Not mine.

56:27.084 --> 56:30.788
- I'll take a mix,
but it needs to be half horses.

56:30.855 --> 56:32.089
- All right.

56:32.156 --> 56:33.891
But don't give me
lip about the horses,

56:33.958 --> 56:35.292
they are what they are.

56:35.359 --> 56:37.628
They--cowboys got all
the good ones these days.

to pull out?

56:43.434 --> 56:46.637

we can teach them first.

56:46.704 --> 56:48.005
I want to give them a chance.

56:49.607 --> 56:52.977
- It's a job, Captain.
And we took it.

56:54.479 --> 56:59.717
All I got's my word
and gonna see it through,

56:59.784 --> 57:02.987
but half these folks
ain't gonna make it,

57:03.053 --> 57:04.489
and we both know it.

57:06.557 --> 57:10.094
It's a free country and...

57:10.160 --> 57:11.829
hell, this is what they chose.

57:13.831 --> 57:15.065
We're doing what we can,

57:15.132 --> 57:17.301
but we need to get moving

57:17.367 --> 57:18.936
or winter's gonna kill us all.

57:20.404 --> 57:21.572
- They're not ready.

57:21.639 --> 57:23.708
- They ain't ever
gonna be ready, Captain.

57:23.774 --> 57:27.645
- Just 'cause they won't survive
doesn't mean we can't try.

57:32.650 --> 57:33.784
- Never say it did.

57:39.423 --> 57:41.291
- All right, mister.

57:41.358 --> 57:45.029
This right here,
that's for the soil.

57:45.095 --> 57:47.031
And this, that's for the bank.

57:47.097 --> 57:48.633
- Thank you.

58:00.678 --> 58:03.213
- This is a rattlesnake.

58:03.280 --> 58:07.384
They hide under
logs, and under rocks.

58:07.451 --> 58:11.255
At night if it's cold
they will look for warmth,

58:11.321 --> 58:14.659
and if you are sleeping on
the ground that warmth is you.

58:16.026 --> 58:18.328
A bite will kill you.

58:21.165 --> 58:23.367
[speaking German]

58:42.352 --> 58:44.989
- This is poison oak
and poison ivy.

58:45.055 --> 58:48.392
It won't kill you,
you'll just wish you were dead.

58:48.458 --> 58:50.795
Do not touch it.

58:50.861 --> 58:52.496
Do not walk in it.

58:54.632 --> 58:57.935
[speaking German]

59:07.444 --> 59:10.147
- What else?

59:10.214 --> 59:11.849
- Water.

59:11.916 --> 59:14.685
- Do not drink water
from the ground.

59:14.752 --> 59:17.588
When we camp,
we will choose a latrine

59:17.655 --> 59:19.456
away from our water source.

59:19.523 --> 59:22.459
- What is a latrine?

59:22.526 --> 59:23.527
- Powder room.

59:26.330 --> 59:28.032
Water closet.

59:30.567 --> 59:33.203
Thomas, help me.

59:33.270 --> 59:34.271
- Toilette.

59:36.874 --> 59:38.876
- What in the hell
is a toilette?

59:38.943 --> 59:41.411
- It's French for shitter.

59:41.478 --> 59:44.649
- When did you learn French?

59:44.715 --> 59:46.917
- I don't know French,
I just...

59:46.984 --> 59:48.452
know the French word
for shitter.

59:48.518 --> 59:50.855
- How do you know the French
word for shitter?

59:50.921 --> 59:52.189
- I used to fuck
a girl from France!

59:52.256 --> 59:54.825
- Fine. That's all
you had to say.

59:54.892 --> 59:56.727
Don't have
to get angry about it.

59:58.328 --> 59:59.630
- We should check them.

1:00:00.798 --> 1:00:02.499
- I know.

1:00:02.566 --> 1:00:04.001
- All of them.

1:00:04.068 --> 1:00:05.202
- I know.

1:00:10.808 --> 1:00:13.143
[music]

1:00:13.210 --> 1:00:14.278
- The farmer.

1:00:24.388 --> 1:00:26.356
- You need help, I'll give it.

1:00:26.423 --> 1:00:29.193
- I'll take it.
Thank you.

1:00:29.259 --> 1:00:30.995

- No, I don't want your money.
I ain't working for you.

1:00:33.197 --> 1:00:34.464
I'm just riding with you.

1:00:34.531 --> 1:00:37.501
- Fair enough...

1:00:37.567 --> 1:00:39.837
How many women in your group?

1:00:39.904 --> 1:00:43.908
- It's all women in my group.
And a five year-old boy.

1:00:43.974 --> 1:00:46.310
- May need to borrow
one of those women.

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:49.046
- Borrow them for what?

1:00:51.148 --> 1:00:53.550
- Next.

1:00:57.454 --> 1:00:59.523
Spin.

1:00:59.589 --> 1:01:01.658
You're done,
step over there.

1:01:01.726 --> 1:01:03.327
Next.

1:01:04.361 --> 1:01:06.496
Come on.

1:01:06.563 --> 1:01:08.966
Take it off.

1:01:09.033 --> 1:01:11.501
Arms up.

1:01:11.568 --> 1:01:14.839
Turn around.
Lift your hair.

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:18.075
Oh, Lord.

1:01:18.142 --> 1:01:19.777
You're done.

1:01:19.844 --> 1:01:21.078
Next.

1:01:22.079 --> 1:01:23.580
- Turn around.

1:01:30.187 --> 1:01:31.588
- Hey.

1:01:40.798 --> 1:01:42.199
- Captain.

1:01:48.238 --> 1:01:49.506
- Put your clothes on.

1:01:52.609 --> 1:01:53.643
Do you have a wife?

1:01:53.710 --> 1:01:55.913
[speaking German]

1:01:55.980 --> 1:01:57.414
- Bring her here.

1:02:00.350 --> 1:02:02.119
- What?

1:02:02.186 --> 1:02:03.487
- Nothing.

1:02:05.289 --> 1:02:07.291
- What did I do?

1:02:07.357 --> 1:02:08.425
- You didn't do anything.

1:02:11.361 --> 1:02:12.696
Thomas.

1:02:14.031 --> 1:02:15.365
- What did I do?

1:02:17.434 --> 1:02:18.735
What did we do?

1:02:20.470 --> 1:02:22.940
- No!
- What did we do?

1:02:23.007 --> 1:02:24.241
- You didn't do anything.

1:02:24.308 --> 1:02:27.912
You have smallpox
and you're going to die.

1:02:27.978 --> 1:02:30.380
In three days you'll
give it to everyone you meet.

1:02:30.447 --> 1:02:33.617
If you have a soul, you will
leave the city and find a river,

1:02:33.683 --> 1:02:36.120
and lay down beside it
and die in peace.

1:02:36.186 --> 1:02:38.155
If I see you again,
I'll kill you myself.

1:02:39.223 --> 1:02:42.192
[speaking German]

1:02:42.259 --> 1:02:43.861
- I don't have this
thing you say.

1:02:43.928 --> 1:02:45.996
- Get the fuck out of town!
- Go on, get out of here!

1:02:46.063 --> 1:02:46.997
- I don't have this thing!

1:02:47.064 --> 1:02:49.333
[clamoring]

1:02:49.399 --> 1:02:50.935
[speaking German]

1:02:56.673 --> 1:02:58.542
- You ready to travel?

1:02:58.608 --> 1:03:00.577
- I've spent my last night
in this town. I'm leaving now.

1:03:02.646 --> 1:03:05.015
- We head north in the morning.

1:03:05.082 --> 1:03:06.550
We'll camp on the Trinity.

1:03:06.616 --> 1:03:10.087
See if we can teach these
people how to drive a wagon.

1:03:10.154 --> 1:03:11.856
- Where on the Trinity?

1:03:11.922 --> 1:03:16.226
- There's a big oak bent over
like an old woman.

1:03:16.293 --> 1:03:19.163
Big boulder
up against the trunk.

1:03:19.229 --> 1:03:21.465
Looks like it's crying
over a grave.

1:03:21.531 --> 1:03:23.000
We'll meet you there.

1:03:24.634 --> 1:03:25.870
- All right.

1:03:25.936 --> 1:03:28.605
[music]

1:03:46.756 --> 1:03:49.994
Elsa: I remember stories
of the great War,

1:03:50.060 --> 1:03:52.562
how it seemed man
had lost all reason.

1:03:53.763 --> 1:03:55.399
That we'd become animals,

1:03:57.267 --> 1:03:59.003
or perhaps we just
surrendered to the fact

1:03:59.069 --> 1:04:01.105
that animals
is all we've ever been.

1:04:01.171 --> 1:04:05.209
[music]

1:04:15.419 --> 1:04:18.388
But there are moments
where I feel we are more.

1:04:18.455 --> 1:04:22.359
Where we have evolved beyond
a search for the next meal

1:04:22.426 --> 1:04:26.163
or the dominance
to breed who we choose.

1:04:26.230 --> 1:04:28.966
Where we breathe fresh air deep

1:04:29.033 --> 1:04:30.567
and can almost
taste its maker.

1:04:30.634 --> 1:04:35.272
[music]

1:04:47.551 --> 1:04:49.253
I wish I could
freeze this moment.

1:04:51.455 --> 1:04:52.856
I would live in it forever...

1:04:54.458 --> 1:04:56.626
swimming in the possible

1:04:56.693 --> 1:04:59.096
while the mud of the real
is stuck to the shore.

1:05:34.298 --> 1:05:35.565
[laughs]

1:05:38.235 --> 1:05:41.972
[music]

1:05:47.444 --> 1:05:49.579
We weren't poor.

1:05:49.646 --> 1:05:51.115
We weren't desperate.

1:05:53.450 --> 1:05:55.819
The road west
is filled with failures...

1:05:58.322 --> 1:06:00.124
but failure
isn't what drove him.

1:06:02.926 --> 1:06:04.028
It was a dream.

1:06:07.197 --> 1:06:09.033
And the dream is coming true...

1:06:12.369 --> 1:06:15.872
