00:13.490 --> 00:14.610
Hello.

00:14.610 --> 00:16.410
I saved you
from a walk of shame.

00:16.410 --> 00:18.660
I'll have you know
that the walk of shame

00:18.660 --> 00:20.290
is an anti‐feminist
construct, okay?

00:20.290 --> 00:21.960
Do I look like I'm in shame?

00:21.960 --> 00:24.170
You're not a feminist,
you're just too lazy
to walk.

00:24.170 --> 00:25.920
I wasn't too lazy
to smash with a guy last night

00:25.920 --> 00:27.960
who's basically Ryan Gosling.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.260
Hey, Esther,
you forgot your night guard.

00:30.260 --> 00:32.670
Man, Ryan Gosling
really let himself go.

00:32.670 --> 00:34.340
Chubby hairy guys make me
feel skinny and pretty

00:34.340 --> 00:36.340
like Rachel McAdams.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.430
Throw it to me!
I don't want to touch it.
It's moldy!

00:38.430 --> 00:40.970
It's not mold, it's just pesto.

00:40.970 --> 00:42.520
We had barbecue last night.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.940
Just throw it down.

00:43.940 --> 00:47.230
You really have to
nudge him to touch stuff.

00:47.230 --> 00:49.440
[whispers]
I didn't have an orgasm.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.610
All right.
Thank you.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.030
Sorry.

00:55.410 --> 00:57.280
Well, that was a short
walk of shame.

00:57.280 --> 01:00.330
Oh, my God,
you're putting that
back in your mouth?

01:00.330 --> 01:01.740
That's where it goes.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.750
Relax. The sprinklers
were just on.

01:03.750 --> 01:05.370
I thought you just
wear that at night.

01:05.370 --> 01:06.920
I've been day‐grinding.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.170
I'm stressed about money
and Boko Haram.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.340
Boko Haram is not
in East Hollywood.
You're fine.

01:11.340 --> 01:13.380
You don't know that.
They could be anywhere.

01:13.380 --> 01:16.010
Text me, Esther.
See ya. Nice to meet you.
I'm Benji.

01:16.010 --> 01:17.720
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, dude.

01:17.720 --> 01:19.430
Uh... this is awkward.

01:19.430 --> 01:22.180
He's just my friend.
Oh, all right.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.730
Yeah, just platonic friends.
I'm not a threat or anything.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.560
All right, stop talking
to my guy.

01:26.560 --> 01:27.600
See ya.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.150
Yeah, see ya, man.

01:29.150 --> 01:30.690
Can we go to
the juice place on Third?

01:30.690 --> 01:32.150
I want to do a cleanse.

01:32.150 --> 01:34.360
I'm feeling high
off my one‐night stand.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.650
You know baby voice
doesn't work on me.
I didn't just sleep with you.

01:36.650 --> 01:38.240
You want to ask me
like an adult?

01:38.240 --> 01:40.120
Let's use adult voice
with me, okay?

01:40.120 --> 01:41.910
Can we please go
to the juice place on Third?

01:41.910 --> 01:43.750
You're doing baby voice.
Try again.

01:43.750 --> 01:48.120
Cleansing will make me
feel skinny and pretty.

02:03.470 --> 02:05.270
I don't know.
She's so hot.

02:05.270 --> 02:07.020
It's hot girl food.

02:07.020 --> 02:08.389
Thank you.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.810
Hi.

02:09.810 --> 02:12.230
I'll take a green herb detox

02:12.230 --> 02:16.530
and... the spirulina crisps...
what are those?

02:16.530 --> 02:19.280
Um, is that
what hot girls eat?
Will they make me glow?

02:19.280 --> 02:20.870
I don't know.

02:20.870 --> 02:22.200
Right.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.740
Hot girls have secrets,
like magicians.

02:23.740 --> 02:25.200
They don't let anyone know.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.710
I'll take five.
I love them.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.290
Gee.
What?

02:30.290 --> 02:31.830
That's a lot of chips, man.
Chill.

02:31.830 --> 02:33.420
Can I borrow 20 bucks?

02:33.420 --> 02:35.840
Are you serious?
I'll pay you back.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.050
How is your family so rich
and you're so poor?

02:38.050 --> 02:39.260
I'm not broke or anything.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.260
I had my identity stolen,

02:40.260 --> 02:42.100
so I need to just
borrow some cash.

02:42.100 --> 02:44.390
Can I get a vitality shot?
Sure.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.470
Thanks.
One vitality shot.

02:45.470 --> 02:48.230
I really like
your nose ring.
Thanks.

02:48.230 --> 02:49.600
I've got a nose for noses

02:49.600 --> 02:50.850
that can handle a nose ring.

02:50.850 --> 02:52.980
Most people can't nail it,

02:52.980 --> 02:54.520
but you're, like, nailing it.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.280
Just in case this is
leading up to asking me out,

02:56.280 --> 02:57.780
I am a lesbian.

02:57.780 --> 02:59.280
No problem. I went
to a liberal arts college.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.360
I've dated plenty
of lesbians, and...

03:01.360 --> 03:02.700
Wait, you're a lesbian?

03:02.700 --> 03:05.490
I am to guys under five‐ten.

Oh, okay, we're being mean.

03:07.620 --> 03:10.500
[scoffs]

03:10.500 --> 03:12.000
You know, shaming a guy
'cause he's short

03:12.000 --> 03:13.380
is like shaming a girl
for being overweight.

03:13.380 --> 03:14.540
We do that here too.

03:14.540 --> 03:16.210
Well, it's wrong.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.970
Any chance you guys are hiring?

03:18.970 --> 03:20.970
No.
Got it.

03:21.970 --> 03:24.390
Got it.

03:24.390 --> 03:26.970
[Benji] Everyone
in that juice place
was the worst.

03:26.970 --> 03:29.230
[Esther] I know. Ugh.

03:29.230 --> 03:30.480
Is your brother home?

03:30.480 --> 03:32.020
I don't think so.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.520
I think he's in Texas
buying foreclosed homes.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.440
And he's a monster.
I wish he wasn't so hot.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.240
You have no chance
with my brother.

03:39.240 --> 03:40.950
You wear your dad's old boxers.

03:40.950 --> 03:42.280
They're vintage.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.530
You don't know
anything about style.

03:43.530 --> 03:45.280
That's really intimate.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.740
I think it's pretty obvious
that you have daddy issues.

03:47.740 --> 03:49.450
All the greats
have daddy issues.

03:49.450 --> 03:51.330
Mine is just that, you know,

03:51.330 --> 03:53.120
I'm a constant disappointment
because I don't have

03:53.120 --> 03:55.500
a real job or a steady income,
and I'm a grown adult.

03:55.500 --> 03:58.050
I DVR'd a Daria marathon.
You want to watch?

03:58.050 --> 04:00.550
Yeah, let's do it.

04:00.550 --> 04:02.380
I think it's broken.

04:02.380 --> 04:04.590
Hey, dude, I put on
the parental lock

04:04.590 --> 04:07.560
so my shows don't
get deleted by your
stupid cartoons.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.510
Come on, man, I live here too.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.560
[Tara] Wait,
this is your brother?

04:10.560 --> 04:12.480
Yeah. And that's
his squatter friend.

04:12.480 --> 04:16.019
I just crash here
sometimes.
Are you homeless?

04:16.019 --> 04:19.149
I actually just
Airbnb my place
for rent money.

04:19.149 --> 04:21.149
There's an oxy addict
living on her sofa.

04:21.149 --> 04:22.900
You don't know that.
He's really sleepy.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.070

04:25.070 --> 04:26.370
[Benji]
I like your accent.

04:26.370 --> 04:27.580
Did you guys meet
at a youth hostel?

04:27.580 --> 04:28.950
We met on an app.

04:28.950 --> 04:30.370
Oh, like a good‐looking
person app?

04:30.370 --> 04:31.580
I mean, I didn't say it.

04:31.580 --> 04:32.910
Oh, God.

04:32.910 --> 04:34.580
So, you guys are not dating?

04:34.580 --> 04:36.250
Just 'cause we're both
small and undesirable,

04:36.250 --> 04:37.500
doesn't mean we should date.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.050
People think we're
dating 'cause we sit

04:39.050 --> 04:40.510
on the same side of
the booth at restaurants.

04:40.510 --> 04:42.170
It's just easier
to share food that way.

04:42.170 --> 04:44.340
I'll give you guys
$550 each if you guys

04:44.340 --> 04:46.140
have sex with each
other right now.

04:46.140 --> 04:48.140
I'd rather let
an entire Greyhound bus

04:48.140 --> 04:49.810
spit in my mouth
than have sex with Benji.

04:49.810 --> 04:51.390
No offense.

04:51.390 --> 04:52.600
Okay, well, then, you know what?

04:52.600 --> 04:53.810
Maybe you need to get
a real girlfriend,

04:53.810 --> 04:55.690
instead of whatever
Esther is, okay?

04:55.690 --> 04:58.310
You guys have sad eyes.
[sniffs]

04:58.310 --> 04:59.900
Is that a good thing?
No.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.360
Sad eyes is a bad thing.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.940
You said he wasn't here.

05:02.940 --> 05:04.450
Look, I'm having
a pool party later,

05:04.450 --> 05:06.570
so, why don't you guys...
you can come.

05:06.570 --> 05:08.570
Uh, it might be fun, you know?

05:08.570 --> 05:09.660
Alia's gonna be there.

you could use some sun.

If I get a job
working for your sister,

05:30.430 --> 05:32.600
it will change my life, okay?

have clothes that fit you.

that I have a charged laptop,

my fake personality

06:19.900 --> 06:22.440
Esther, you can't
wear that to a pool party.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.480
This is the most
stylish thing I own.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.650
You look like a Syrian refugee.

You don't know anything.

06:29.910 --> 06:31.910

not a fashion person,

06:31.910 --> 06:33.660

really well,

06:33.660 --> 06:36.120

you're trying too hard.

Is that better?

Do you have
an actual bathing suit?

I do, but I got it
at the Comedy Store
lost and found,

07:10.530 --> 07:12.320
Um, by the way,
my name's Esther.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.330
You should hire her.

07:14.330 --> 07:18.200
She has, um,
small hands, and she can
fix sewing machines.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.000

for American Girl doll catalog,

on my cuticle.

I don't wash it
because of the draught.

is, like, not trying.

She's lazy chic.

I am actually not lazy at all.

Um, do lazy people
put fruit in their water?

They don't. [chuckles]
I'm screaming.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.350
Please hire her.
She'll work hard,

07:41.350 --> 07:43.350
and, like, you don't
even have to pay her much.

07:43.350 --> 07:45.940
You're, like, so thirsty.
I'm sorry, he's so thirsty.

a cup of water, I'm good.

[laughter]

07:50.530 --> 07:51.900
Yeah.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.700
Esther has a permanent
fat wrinkle on her stomach,

07:53.700 --> 07:56.370
and we call it her equator.

07:56.370 --> 07:58.410
Oh, my God,
that's so embarrassing.

07:58.410 --> 07:59.950
I'm gonna go get a refill.

07:59.950 --> 08:01.410
He's good. Everyone's good.

08:01.410 --> 08:02.540
Good, good.

08:02.540 --> 08:03.710
Dude, what are you doing?

08:03.710 --> 08:05.000
Why are you making fun of me?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.670
Bye.
[Benji]
You look good today.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.130
You don't get it.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.920
I was trying to be funny.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.050
Watching you talk to hot girls

08:11.050 --> 08:12.300
is like watching a white person

08:12.300 --> 08:14.140
try to explain
why all lives matter.

08:14.140 --> 08:15.390
[Benji] All you do
is pick on me.

08:15.390 --> 08:16.640
They bicker like an old couple.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.640
[chuckles]
I know.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.220
They should just, you know,

08:19.220 --> 08:20.730
they should just date.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.440
I know. Millennials,
they don't date.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.770
They don't even sex.
They just flow through life,

08:24.770 --> 08:27.480
too distracted by how lonely
they really are.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.190
You're a talking penis!
You're a talking penis!

08:29.190 --> 08:31.490
You're a talking penis!
You're a talking penis!

08:31.490 --> 08:32.990
You're a talking penis.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.950
Everybody here thinks
you're a talking penis.

08:34.950 --> 08:36.620
All right, I need to get
you away from me, okay?

08:36.620 --> 08:37.830
I need alone time
with your sister.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.620
I'm gonna find you
a girl to talk to,

08:39.620 --> 08:40.789
got it?

08:43.289 --> 08:44.710
All right, she's in long pants,

08:44.710 --> 08:46.330
so just give it a try.

08:46.330 --> 08:48.420
...Miss Chanel
is the way to go.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.420
Hey. Sorry to interrupt you.
Super rude, I get it.

08:51.420 --> 08:53.510
This is Benji.
This is his house.

08:53.510 --> 08:56.800
Wow. That...
is so cool.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.800
[chuckles]
I'm Charlotte, so...

08:58.800 --> 09:01.140
Wait. That's such
a cool Céline bag.

09:01.140 --> 09:04.770
Oh, thanks!
This is a work gift.

09:04.770 --> 09:05.940
Are you serious?
What do you do?

09:05.940 --> 09:07.730
I'm a nanny.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.230
Whoa, lucky.

09:09.230 --> 09:10.480
I was a nanny, and all I got

09:10.480 --> 09:12.150
was a little boy's old shoes.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.610
So, you live here alone, Benji?

09:15.610 --> 09:17.360
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, kind of.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.580
I‐I let my poor friends
crash here.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.660
That's really kind of you.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.250
That's my thing, kind.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.540
Everyone's always like,
"You're so kind."

09:25.540 --> 09:28.960
Take her on a tour, stupid!
Yeah, stupid!

09:28.960 --> 09:30.710
I love the way
you called me stupid!

09:30.710 --> 09:32.590
Oh, okay.

09:32.590 --> 09:33.760
See ya.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.050
I'm the best wing man.

09:36.050 --> 09:37.890
[gasps]
Yes, thank you.

09:37.890 --> 09:39.510
No offense, Alia,

09:39.510 --> 09:40.760
but I can't eat
any of this food.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.310
Yeah, it's so unhealthy.

09:42.310 --> 09:44.230
I know. I wanted to get,
like, fun party food.

09:44.230 --> 09:46.730
I didn't realize
it was gonna be something
none of us would eat.

09:46.730 --> 09:49.360
[girls complaining]

09:49.360 --> 09:50.560
That's Allen Iverson.

09:50.560 --> 09:51.860
He's small and mighty, like me.

09:51.860 --> 09:53.280
Good show.
This...

09:53.280 --> 09:54.820
is my Nolan Ryan rookie card.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.700
It's probably the most
expensive thing I own.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.070
He was a Met. A lot of
people don't know that.

09:59.070 --> 10:00.200
Do you like baseball?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.700
Mmm... I like
Laker floor seats.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.620
Okay.
That's something else.

10:04.620 --> 10:06.750
Wait, who are those ladies
that I saw you hanging with

10:06.750 --> 10:08.040
before we met?

10:08.040 --> 10:10.290
Oh, that's just my sister
and her employees.

10:10.290 --> 10:12.250
She runs this fashion company
called Vindication.

10:12.250 --> 10:13.880
What?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.710
Wait, your sister
is Vindication?

10:15.710 --> 10:17.130
Yeah, she started it,
she runs it.

10:17.130 --> 10:18.800
She makes the clothes.
It's all her.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.890
It's just like
my favorite brand ever.

10:20.890 --> 10:22.720
I wear them, like,
every single day.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.810
She made me business cards
that say I'm vice president

10:24.810 --> 10:26.060
to help me meet girls...
do you want one?

10:26.060 --> 10:27.560
[clears throat]

10:27.560 --> 10:31.230
Mmm... hi.
Hey.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.270
I'm Benji,
vice president
of Vindication.

10:33.270 --> 10:36.690
Third quarter projections
are looking healthy.

10:36.690 --> 10:39.410
You know I'm not really,
like, the vice president
of Vindication.

10:39.410 --> 10:41.200
She just made me
business cards.
I don't care.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.880
You're so cool.

10:51.880 --> 10:52.880
Okay. Cool.

10:54.590 --> 10:57.130
Vivian, come on,
your perfume is
getting in my mouth.

10:57.130 --> 10:58.670
I want to smell you,
not taste you.

10:58.670 --> 11:00.760
Hey, do you guys like
spirulina crisps?

11:00.760 --> 11:03.140
I feel like the food here
is just not edible.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.560
Um, Edna for the win!

11:05.560 --> 11:06.770
Yeah, I, like...
I'm obsessed.

11:06.770 --> 11:08.310
I can't leave my house
without these.

11:08.310 --> 11:09.810
I eat them all the time.

11:09.810 --> 11:11.520
Mmm.
Also, my name is Esther.

11:11.520 --> 11:12.730
So, I heard you're hiring,

11:12.730 --> 11:13.860
which is crazy 'cause like,

11:13.860 --> 11:15.520
I'm pretty free.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.820
Hey, Al, meet
my friend Charlotte.

11:17.820 --> 11:20.530
It's so cool to meet you.
I just love your top.

11:20.530 --> 11:23.820
Thank you. I've
actually been dying to
talk bikinis with someone.

11:23.820 --> 11:25.200
Yours...
come on, it's just...

11:25.200 --> 11:27.490
What's going on?
Wait, what do you do?

11:27.490 --> 11:29.040
I'm nannying right now,
but I'm actually

11:29.040 --> 11:30.870
just dying to get into fashion.

11:30.870 --> 11:31.790
Oh, my God, you're perfect.

11:31.790 --> 11:33.330
You should come in
and talk to me.

11:33.330 --> 11:34.790
I've been looking for
someone just like you.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.800
It's actually really good
to have experience

11:36.800 --> 11:39.010
cleaning up vomit when
you're dealing with models.

11:39.010 --> 11:41.010
Awesome! Yeah,
I would love that.

11:41.010 --> 11:42.010
Should I come in too?

11:42.010 --> 11:43.720
[squealing conversation]

11:43.720 --> 11:45.010
What just happened?

11:45.010 --> 11:46.010
I think I just got my first

11:46.010 --> 11:47.390
non‐summer camp girlfriend.

11:47.390 --> 11:48.850
Do you think she was
talking to me?

11:48.850 --> 11:50.940
I don't think anyone
was talking to you.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.700
Oh, hey.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.160
Why are you wearing
your prom shirt?

12:07.160 --> 12:08.870
Charlotte and I are going
to Mastro's.

12:08.870 --> 12:11.580
Are you serious?
Yeah!

12:11.580 --> 12:14.880
Ooh, you're so happy.
It's so annoying.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.670
What's the problem?

12:16.670 --> 12:17.920
I want to go
to Mastro's someday.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.170
I want to try filet medallions.

12:19.170 --> 12:21.050
So save up money,
go to Mastro's.

12:21.050 --> 12:24.220
[scoffs] Charlotte.
First my dream job,
then my dream entree.

12:24.220 --> 12:26.100
Are you still mad
about that job?

12:26.100 --> 12:27.850
Yeah.
Why don't you just
try to find something

12:27.850 --> 12:29.890
more in your wheelhouse?

12:29.890 --> 12:32.850
Have you thought about,
like, being a notary
or something?

12:32.850 --> 12:34.690
What's up, guys?
Hey, Jeff.

12:34.690 --> 12:36.400
What's up, bro?
How you doing?
Good to see you.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.360
Oh, wow, we're hugging.
You know I don't like hugs.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.570
I know, that's
why I do it to you.
You need affection.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.650
My parents
didn't give me hugs.
It's weird for me.

12:42.650 --> 12:44.240
Adjust.
Okay.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.200
Let me ask you a question...
you goin' to a funeral?

12:46.200 --> 12:48.030
What's up with that shirt?

12:48.030 --> 12:50.120
You sitting Shiva?

12:50.120 --> 12:51.790
All right.
I taught him Jewish stuff.

12:51.790 --> 12:53.500
Make fun of the guy
trying to find true love.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.710
Thanks, guys.
See you later. Thanks.

12:55.710 --> 12:57.210
Benji's going on a date
with a girl

12:57.210 --> 12:59.090
who only likes him 'cause
he lives in a nice house.

12:59.090 --> 13:00.960
Oh, I only like Benji 'cause
he lives in a nice house.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.800
I know. Same.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.180
I don't know.
Something doesn't
add up about that girl.

13:05.180 --> 13:07.050
Why?
That Miss Chanel
she nannies for

13:07.050 --> 13:09.100
must be crazy rich
if they gave her
a Céline purse.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.100
I nannied for a rich family
for two years,

13:11.100 --> 13:13.640
and my bag is still
a reusable tote.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.810
Um, Miss Chanel's not a person,

13:15.810 --> 13:18.020
it's an escort website.

13:18.020 --> 13:22.030
Shut up. Are you serious?
Oh, absolutely.

13:22.030 --> 13:24.700
So, that's... that's
an escort he's about
to get dinner with?

13:24.700 --> 13:25.990
He's gonna go on a date
with an escort.

13:25.990 --> 13:28.490
I need to tell him,
like, immediately.

13:28.490 --> 13:30.910
Aw, don't ruin it for him.
He's gonna have some
really good escort sex.

13:30.910 --> 13:34.120
Jeff, don't be
disgusting, okay?
That's so criminal.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.960
I don't like
to criminalize sex workers.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.330
How do I prove it to him?
He'll never believe me.

13:37.330 --> 13:38.960
He thinks I'm jealous of him.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.590
You can't see
the ladies' profiles
on the website

13:41.590 --> 13:43.380
unless you're a subscriber.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.130
I don't even have a working
credit card right now.

13:45.130 --> 13:46.130
I don't know how I'd sign up.

13:46.130 --> 13:46.930
I know what you can do.

13:46.930 --> 13:49.090
Make yourself a profile.
Okay.

13:49.090 --> 13:51.310
You'll be like
an escort and you can
see the women that way.

13:51.310 --> 13:52.770
Right, that's safe.

13:52.770 --> 13:54.270
Yeah. Absolutely.

13:54.270 --> 13:55.930
Yeah. No one's
gonna hit me up.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.440
I mean, I would.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.150
I like fat guys.
This is going nowhere.

14:00.150 --> 14:02.940
You're a real hero.
I know.

14:02.940 --> 14:05.110
[Benji] Good morning.
[Esther] Good morning!
Hey there!

14:05.110 --> 14:07.110
I have to talk to you
about something.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.910
Charlotte's not a nanny.

14:08.910 --> 14:10.120
What are you talking about?

14:10.120 --> 14:11.830
She's an escort.

14:13.910 --> 14:15.120
Miss Chanel isn't a person.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.660
It's an escort website.

14:17.660 --> 14:19.420
I mean...
that could be anybody.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.920
The face is blurred out.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.710
Benji, same hair, same height,

14:22.710 --> 14:25.170
same exact silver handbag.

14:25.170 --> 14:27.630
Oh, no.
Same Ohio State tattoo.

14:27.630 --> 14:29.220
[text indicator plinks]

14:33.970 --> 14:35.810
She's three out of five stars.

14:35.810 --> 14:38.140
That's crazy.
Like, she seemed
five‐star to me.

14:38.140 --> 14:41.150
I don't have any basis
of comparison, but...
Who are you texting?

14:41.150 --> 14:42.980
Take a minute to process
what's going on.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.980
[sighs]
This is the worst.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.990
I know, it is really rough,

14:46.990 --> 14:48.320
but you have to end it.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.070
I can't just end it.

14:50.070 --> 14:51.620
She smells like tangerines.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.870
It's apricot,
and this is serious, okay?

14:53.870 --> 14:56.370
You're not the kind
of guy that can roll
with shady people.

14:56.370 --> 14:58.160
What if a pimp shows up
here and demands money?

14:58.160 --> 14:59.790
You won't know what to do.

14:59.790 --> 15:02.000
That's crazy.
Is it? Is it crazy?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.250
Do you even know
what a shank is?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.000
It's street talk for "knife."

15:05.000 --> 15:06.630
You know what...
now that I know
she has a dark side,

15:06.630 --> 15:07.710
I'm kind of into her even more.

15:07.710 --> 15:09.170
It's like dating Catwoman.

15:09.170 --> 15:10.930
If she's here, she'll
use the laundry machine,

15:10.930 --> 15:12.090
our underwear will touch,

15:12.090 --> 15:13.220
and I'll get HPV.

15:13.220 --> 15:14.220
Everyone has HPV.

15:14.220 --> 15:15.430
I don't have HPV,

15:15.430 --> 15:16.600
and I'm the last one without it.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.020
It's a selling point,

15:18.020 --> 15:19.140
and you know I don't
have many of those.

15:19.140 --> 15:20.640
I never get to make out
with anybody.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.190
I haven't done
under‐the‐pants stuff

15:22.190 --> 15:23.980
with a girl since
my ska band broke up.

15:23.980 --> 15:26.400
This is sad.
I thought this would be
fun, but it's just sad.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.610
Yeah, that's fine.

15:30.780 --> 15:32.820
Oh. Oh, wait a minute,
there's more.

15:33.950 --> 15:35.370
Oh, that looks delicious.

15:35.370 --> 15:36.830
Thank you.

15:36.830 --> 15:37.830
Is this too much food?

15:37.830 --> 15:39.370
I feel like I over‐ordered.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.370
No, no, no, no.
You... are a growing girl.

15:41.370 --> 15:42.920
You need to eat.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.880
[sighs] Thanks. I've just
been stressed lately

15:44.880 --> 15:47.000
'cause I have this friend
and he won't listen to me,

15:47.000 --> 15:50.090
and I feel like
it's getting in the way
of me getting a real job.

15:50.090 --> 15:51.680
Well, I mean,
you're a standup.
That's a real job.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.220
[scoffs]
Not to my dad.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.470
He says I'm failing
'cause by my age,

15:55.470 --> 15:57.470
Amy Winehouse was already
famous and dead.

15:57.470 --> 15:58.680
That's nonsense.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.600
Amy Winehouse was not an artist.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.310
Really?
Oh, no. Ooh, God.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.650
Yeah, all my jokes
are really personal
and about me.

16:05.650 --> 16:07.070
Can I hear one?

16:07.070 --> 16:08.690
Sure. The name Esther
isn't, like,

16:08.690 --> 16:11.240
really for a hot girl,

16:11.240 --> 16:14.030
so I feel like I'm
"Esther pretty."

16:14.030 --> 16:16.660
That's, like,
as pretty as you can be
with the name Esther.

16:16.660 --> 16:19.160
[laughing]

16:19.160 --> 16:22.790
[coughing] Okay,
no eating during joke time.

16:22.790 --> 16:24.210
[both laugh]

16:24.210 --> 16:25.380
Do you really think
it's that funny?

16:25.380 --> 16:27.000
My God, that's brilliant.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.300
It's so cool to talk to you

16:28.300 --> 16:29.550
'cause I just, I don't know...

16:29.550 --> 16:30.920
sometimes I think I'm a loser

16:30.920 --> 16:34.680
'cause I only own one towel.

16:34.680 --> 16:37.470
Well, I could take you shopping

16:37.470 --> 16:40.270
after this, unless
you think it's weird.
Are you kidding me?

16:40.270 --> 16:41.930
If I was home
in Illinois right now,

16:41.930 --> 16:44.020
that's exactly what I
would be doing with my dad,

16:44.020 --> 16:45.730
so of course that's not weird.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.270
Good. In that case,

16:47.270 --> 16:49.070
I want you to have
some of this soup.

16:49.070 --> 16:51.820
Yes, please.
Mmm. Mmm‐hmm.

16:51.820 --> 16:53.490
I'm glad the job's working out.

16:53.490 --> 16:54.910
Yeah, I love it.

16:54.910 --> 16:56.280
I've been getting
tons of free clothes,

16:56.280 --> 16:58.240
but I always get free clothing.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.490
Yeah, I have older siblings too.

16:59.490 --> 17:00.740
Oh, your lift is here.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.120
Wait.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.960
What?
[Esther] Thank you so much.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.460
Okay, you got
everything?
Yeah.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.210
Okay, thanks for a great
evening, Esther.

17:07.210 --> 17:08.710
Listen, I'll PayPal you.
Got it.

17:08.710 --> 17:10.130
Melting gelato.
Gotta run. [chuckles]

17:10.130 --> 17:11.550
[Benji]
Who was that?

17:11.550 --> 17:13.380
Oh, my God,
I totally know that guy.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.180
He used to go out
with my old coworker.

17:15.180 --> 17:18.140
He bought her a Vespa,
which is pretty cool.

17:18.140 --> 17:19.930
Like, a nanny coworker?

17:19.930 --> 17:21.560
Yeah.

17:24.690 --> 17:28.190
Melting gelato?
When do you not finish
your dessert?

17:28.190 --> 17:30.320
You're such a hypocrite.
What are you talking about?

17:30.320 --> 17:32.400
You acted
all worried about me
for dating Charlotte,

17:32.400 --> 17:35.240
but what's more dangerous
than being an actual escort?
What do you mean?

17:35.240 --> 17:37.990
Charlotte recognized that guy.
She's worked with him before.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.120
All we did was eat
mac and cheese, and he
got me a shower caddy.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.080
That's it.
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.410
You're ruining your
family name for free
bathroom essentials.

17:45.410 --> 17:46.710
Don't judge me, okay?

17:46.710 --> 17:48.290
I only got into this
to protect you.

17:48.290 --> 17:50.960
Protect me?
You could literally
get your head cut off!

17:50.960 --> 17:53.340
Oh, come on. Warren's not
cutting anyone's head off,

17:53.340 --> 17:55.220
not with his rheumatoid
arthritis, okay?

17:55.220 --> 17:57.340
Esther, I'm scared for you.

17:57.340 --> 17:59.390
You weigh, like, 99 pounds.

17:59.390 --> 18:01.350
You think?
Don't be cute.

18:01.350 --> 18:04.430
When guys give girls
money to hang out with them,

18:04.430 --> 18:06.850
they're going to feel
entitled to things.

18:06.850 --> 18:08.650
There's no sex involved.

18:08.650 --> 18:10.480
I've seen you
eat mac and cheese.
It's very sexual.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.110
That may be true,
but you know what?

18:12.110 --> 18:14.150
I have everything
I need from this, okay?

18:14.150 --> 18:15.650
Money to pay down
my student loans,

18:15.650 --> 18:18.610
and emotional support
from a baby boomer.
Let me be.

18:18.610 --> 18:20.320
What happened to the Esther
I used to know?

18:20.320 --> 18:23.740
Hannah Montana Esther is
dead. Welcome to Miley.

18:23.740 --> 18:25.950
You should just go.
I'm done with you.

18:25.950 --> 18:27.910
Just don't tell
my sister anything.

18:27.910 --> 18:29.460
I told your sister
about Charlotte.

18:29.460 --> 18:32.290
She's probably
fired her by now. Peace.

18:32.290 --> 18:34.920
That's okay.
Me and Charlotte
have a strong love.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.840
Doesn't matter if she
loses that job.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.090
[Esther] Yeah.

18:42.010 --> 18:44.350
Your sister fired me.

18:44.350 --> 18:46.390
Damn it! I hate her.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.230
My sister.
I hate my sister.

18:48.230 --> 18:50.520
I don't know. I'm so upset.
Will you just console me?

18:50.520 --> 18:52.310
Come lay with me,
tell me all about it.

18:52.310 --> 18:55.400
I don't want to,
like, sit and watch
cartoons with you, okay?

18:55.400 --> 18:57.150
"Console me" means, like,
buy me a present.

18:57.150 --> 18:58.400
Ohh. Okay.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.780
Here's the thing with presents.

18:59.780 --> 19:02.620
You look like someone
who deserves presents.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.530
I want to give you presents.
Thank you.

19:04.530 --> 19:06.290
The thing is, is that

19:06.290 --> 19:07.870
I'm not gonna see my parents
for a couple of days,

19:07.870 --> 19:10.370
and that's when
I get my fresh round
of gift cards.

19:10.370 --> 19:12.670
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna go.

19:12.670 --> 19:14.290
Don't go, don't go,
come on, please don't go.

19:14.290 --> 19:15.880
Come on. Um...
[groaning] What?

19:15.880 --> 19:17.880
There's a ton of leftover
booze from the party.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.470
We can make mixed drinks
or something.

19:19.470 --> 19:20.680
That sounds fun, right?

19:20.680 --> 19:21.930
[cartoon music playing]

19:21.930 --> 19:23.510
Okay.
Yeah?

19:23.510 --> 19:25.140
I'll have a vodka cranberry

19:25.140 --> 19:27.270
and you have a vodka vodka.

19:27.270 --> 19:29.640
Vodka vodka vodka.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.310
It's a Fozzie Bear joke.

19:31.310 --> 19:32.850
I don't...

19:34.270 --> 19:35.360
I'll make our drinks.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.530
Okay.

19:36.530 --> 19:38.320
Living in L. A.
is so intimidating.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.860
All the girls are so pretty.

19:39.860 --> 19:42.410
I have to drive
to Van Nuys just
to take a spin class.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.410
Come on, Esther,
I will not let you

19:44.410 --> 19:46.240
talk about yourself like that.

19:46.240 --> 19:48.700
You are a young, beautiful girl.

19:48.700 --> 19:52.080
And my cheekbones...
you can see them?

19:52.080 --> 19:55.170
Are you kidding?
Ray Charles can see
those cheekbones.

19:55.170 --> 19:58.260
I don't know who that is,
but he sounds so nice.

19:58.260 --> 20:01.470
Honestly, Warren, you've
been so supportive of me.

20:01.470 --> 20:04.470
I just don't want you
to ever doubt yourself.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.720
I guess.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.310
Pinky swear.

20:08.720 --> 20:09.730
Okay.

20:12.140 --> 20:14.060
[gasps]
What are you doing?

20:14.060 --> 20:16.820
Eww! Aah!
Wha wha wha wha...!

20:16.820 --> 20:19.480
Ugh!
I thought we were
feeling the sa...

20:21.240 --> 20:23.200
Where the hell
did I park my car?

20:24.490 --> 20:26.450
Wake up.
Benji, wake up.

20:26.450 --> 20:28.330
Hey, I've been day‐drinking.

20:28.330 --> 20:30.330
I'm really, really
creeped out right now.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.960
The old guy I met
online who paid me to eat
macaroni wearing sweatpants

20:32.960 --> 20:34.880
turned out to be a total creep.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.460
Really?

20:36.460 --> 20:37.840
[sighs]

20:37.840 --> 20:39.170
I can't believe I'm saying this,

20:39.170 --> 20:40.510
but I should have
listened to you.

20:40.510 --> 20:42.050
Well, firstly, you've
got to stop dating guys

20:42.050 --> 20:43.970
who have 12‐year‐old
girl fetishes.

20:43.970 --> 20:47.260
It's really hard.
Look, man, you just
gotta accept it...

20:47.260 --> 20:48.720
you're not a fashionista,

20:48.720 --> 20:50.720
you're not an escort,
you're an Esther.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.680
Wait, where's Charlotte?
We're supposed to go

20:52.680 --> 20:54.730
to the farmer's market
like tall couples do.

20:54.730 --> 20:56.350
Charlotte!
She's not here.

20:56.350 --> 20:58.440
The house was empty
when I got here.

20:59.570 --> 21:00.940
Oh, my God!

21:00.940 --> 21:02.530
My baseball card is missing!

21:02.530 --> 21:03.950
Did Charlotte rob you?

21:03.950 --> 21:05.200
You're victim shaming me.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.070
Benji, relax, okay?

21:07.070 --> 21:09.490
Look, one day
your trust fund's
gonna kick in,

21:09.490 --> 21:12.450
and you'll meet someone
who likes you for you.

21:12.450 --> 21:14.250
Thanks?

21:14.250 --> 21:15.790
Let's just promise
that we're not gonna do

21:15.790 --> 21:18.250
any more escort stuff
and move on with our lives.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.380
You're right.
We're done with escorting.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.460
Okay, fine. Right.
We're done, right?

21:22.460 --> 21:25.340
Are you sure
this is a good way
to get over Charlotte?

21:25.340 --> 21:26.640
You're gonna find love
with an escort

21:26.640 --> 21:28.550
come hell or high water.

21:28.550 --> 21:30.390
I'm kinda nervous.
I got the cheapest one.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.770
I hope she's pretty.

21:33.730 --> 21:35.940
Hi, I'm Alicia Silverstein.

21:35.940 --> 21:38.060
I'm here to meet Nolan.

21:41.150 --> 21:43.940
Ugh.
[laughter]

21:43.940 --> 21:46.200
The two of you were meant
to be together,

21:46.200 --> 21:47.490
like O. J. and jail.

21:47.490 --> 21:50.370
The universe is gonna get
what it wants.

21:52.080 --> 21:54.330
I like your sex worker outfit.

21:54.330 --> 21:56.330
Thank you.

21:56.330 --> 21:58.380
I like your
Eddie Munster costume.

21:58.380 --> 21:59.630
Did you rob an 11‐year‐old?

21:59.630 --> 22:01.630
Is that where you got
this outfit from?

22:01.630 --> 22:03.630
You rob a slutty 11‐year‐old?

22:03.630 --> 22:05.840
This is what I've always
wanted to look like.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.590
Is it really?
Yeah.

22:07.590 --> 22:10.640
You look like
the Jewish version
of Annie, the musical.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.390
That's actually way...
that's crazy,

22:12.390 --> 22:14.560
'cause that is literally
what you look like.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.350
[laughs softly]

22:16.350 --> 22:18.270
[laughing]
That is so insane,

22:18.270 --> 22:19.980
'cause that is you.

22:19.980 --> 22:21.860
Can we go?
For real, can we go?
No.

22:21.860 --> 22:23.860
These nachos
aren't gonna travel.
This is $30 worth of food.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.150
I'm not letting it go to waste.

22:25.150 --> 22:26.570
I'm from the Midwest.

22:26.570 --> 22:27.820
We don't waste food.

22:27.820 --> 22:29.820
Well, if we're gonna
be here forever,

22:29.820 --> 22:31.740
I found this shady
European website,

22:31.740 --> 22:34.580
and you can stream episodes
of Daria for free.

22:34.580 --> 22:35.830
Sure, I'm down.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.620
Are we gonna die alone?

22:39.620 --> 22:41.630
You know, I've
put a lot of thought
into that, and yeah.

22:41.630 --> 22:43.380
Right.
Well, you know what?

22:43.380 --> 22:44.630
Small talk with dying people

22:44.630 --> 22:46.590
is super uncomfortable anyways.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.590
I know.
When my Nana was dying,

22:48.590 --> 22:51.010
out of habit, I was like,
"How's life?"

22:51.010 --> 22:53.470
She, like, died, like,
an hour later.

22:53.470 --> 22:54.760
Life was sixty minutes.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.390
