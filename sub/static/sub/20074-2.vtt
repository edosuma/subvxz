- You're looking at it?
- From the feed.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.375
- What feed?
- The 24-hour feed?

09:16.375 --> 09:19.291
[Beth] You know how at the end
of every show, you say,

09:19.291 --> 09:23.875
"Remember to follow us
live online, 24 hours a day"?

09:23.875 --> 09:26.542
That's  what that means.

09:26.542 --> 09:27.667
- [Beth] Yup.
- Yup.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.375
Oh, shit.

09:29.375 --> 09:30.458
Where is it?

09:30.458 --> 09:32.083
Oh, it's pretty much everywhere.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.000
If you go to your kitchen,

09:33.000 --> 09:34.083
your microwave's
probably showing it.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.709
[sighs] Fuck.

09:37.041 --> 09:38.458
[groans]

09:38.458 --> 09:41.458
- [keys clack]
- Holy crap.

09:41.458 --> 09:42.667
What's he doing?

09:42.667 --> 09:44.500
Just watch.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.959
Whoa.

09:45.959 --> 09:48.375
You could see that thing
from space.

09:48.375 --> 09:51.500
[oh!]

09:51.500 --> 09:55.291
[chuckling] Oh, my God!

09:55.291 --> 09:58.250
Oh, my God!

09:58.250 --> 09:59.667
[gasps] Oh, my God!

09:59.667 --> 10:00.083
You're welcome.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.291
No.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.500
Rosa just showed up.
Shit.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
Rosa?

10:05.500 --> 10:06.834
My maid.

10:06.834 --> 10:08.750
Is it Tuesday again?

10:08.750 --> 10:12.417
Uh, yeah, it's been happening
every week right around now.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.750
Shit!
She's getting out of the car.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.959
Is this some kind
of murdering maid?

10:16.959 --> 10:20.000
Probably. I haven't paid her
in, like, four weeks.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.250
- Why?
- 'Cause I've been

10:21.250 --> 10:22.709
saving up to buy a pony.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.500
- I'm broke!
- That broke?

10:24.500 --> 10:25.750
Yes, that broke.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.166
Then why not just let her go?

10:28.166 --> 10:29.542
I don't want to lose her.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.291
No, of course not.

10:31.291 --> 10:32.375
- [car door slams]
- Oh, fuck!

10:32.375 --> 10:33.542
Here she comes.

10:33.542 --> 10:36.709
I'm gonna dead-bolt the door.

10:36.709 --> 10:37.125
What's happening?

10:37.125 --> 10:38.208
Shh!

10:38.208 --> 10:40.208
[keys jingling]

10:40.208 --> 10:42.375
- [thud]
- Oh!

10:42.375 --> 10:43.417
[panting]

10:43.417 --> 10:46.083
[laughing] Hey, Rosa.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.583
Hola.

10:47.583 --> 10:52.083
Uh, I was just
looking for my, um,

10:52.083 --> 10:53.125
um...

10:53.125 --> 10:54.291
[Beverly] Dignity?

10:54.291 --> 10:56.542
[laughs]
I...

10:56.542 --> 10:58.208
Jesus.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.834
Well, can't they just take
the fucking thing down?

10:59.834 --> 11:02.333
Honey, it's the Internet.
There is no down.

11:02.333 --> 11:05.250
So, uh, not to judge, but...

11:05.250 --> 11:06.500
what the hell were you thinking?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.000
I don't know.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.667
I guess I was thinking,

11:09.667 --> 11:11.458
"I sure wish I could
get through that glass."

11:11.458 --> 11:12.917
[chuckles]

11:12.917 --> 11:13.750
Y-you're not getting
how serious this is.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.917
Look, I had a few beers.
She was hot.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.709
Realistically,
how else was that gonna end?

11:17.709 --> 11:21.166
Well, it might end
with you out of a job.

11:21.166 --> 11:22.208
Oh, come on.

11:22.208 --> 11:23.709
They're freaking out over there.

11:23.709 --> 11:25.500
It had nothing to do
with their stupid game.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.583
They're saying it looks like

11:27.583 --> 11:31.667
you're giving one contestant

11:31.667 --> 11:33.250
preferential treatment.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.625
Fine.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.125
I'll whack off
on all their boxes.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.917
Yeah, I'm not writing this down.

11:38.917 --> 11:40.625
Wait a minute,
if they fire me,

11:40.625 --> 11:42.166
they still have to pay me,
right?

11:42.166 --> 11:43.083
No.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.542
I thought we had
a pay-or-play deal.

11:44.542 --> 11:45.375
There's a morals clause.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.000
A morals clause?

11:47.000 --> 11:47.709
You never told me
there was a morals clause.

11:47.709 --> 11:50.041
I never thought it would matter.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.250
With me?

11:51.250 --> 11:52.583
You know what?

11:52.583 --> 11:53.834
If they want to fire me,
then fuck 'em.

11:53.834 --> 11:54.709
You can't fuck 'em.

11:54.709 --> 11:55.875
Oh, I can fuck 'em.

11:55.875 --> 11:56.792
What about the money?

11:56.792 --> 11:57.667
Fuck the money.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.166
Never fuck the money!

12:00.166 --> 12:02.583
[exhales]

12:02.583 --> 12:03.458
You can't afford
to fuck the money.

12:03.458 --> 12:05.333
You know that.

12:07.583 --> 12:08.458
So now what?

12:08.458 --> 12:09.875
Beth?

12:09.875 --> 12:11.667
Well, you start by
releasing a statement

12:11.667 --> 12:14.250
accepting full responsibility
for your actions.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.375
Fine.

12:15.375 --> 12:16.834
You apologize

12:16.834 --> 12:18.750
to the network and to your fans.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.250
[Beth] You acknowledge you have
a serious problem.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.375
And then you say
you're going into rehab

12:23.375 --> 12:24.208
for sexual addiction.

12:24.208 --> 12:26.208
No!

12:26.208 --> 12:27.792
Look, this is bullshit.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.041
I'm calling the network.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.208
Do not call the network.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.250
We will handle it.

12:31.250 --> 12:31.917
I'm calling Elliot Salad.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.750
Do not call Elliot Salad.

12:33.750 --> 12:34.417
Why not?
He loves me.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.291
Listen to me,

12:36.291 --> 12:38.083
do not call Elliot Salad.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.458
I'm calling Elliot Salad.

12:39.458 --> 12:40.083
I'm begging you,

12:40.083 --> 12:42.500
do not call Elliot Salad!

12:42.500 --> 12:44.792
You can't stop me
from calling Elliot Salad.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.834
I'm calling Elliot Salad.

- Yeah?

12:55.208 --> 12:56.041
I need Elliot Salad's number.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.917
What happened to me?

13:00.917 --> 13:03.667
I was important.

13:03.667 --> 13:06.458
I had a career.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.834
People brought me lunch.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.333
They kissed my ass.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.458
Now look at it.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.000
It's just an ass.

[cell phone ringtone playing]

13:20.667 --> 13:23.709
Do you need to get that?

[ringtone continues]

13:25.000 --> 13:26.041
Mm.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.291
It's like,

13:30.291 --> 13:33.750
I remember
this one particular day.

13:33.750 --> 13:36.917
I was in New York
for the up-fronts.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.500
It was my first one.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.583
I was so young.

13:41.583 --> 13:46.375
And...in that one day,

13:46.375 --> 13:50.458
I was in the room when they
canceled the John Stamos show;

13:50.458 --> 13:54.458
I saw Brooke Shields

13:54.458 --> 13:57.500
in the lobby of my hotel;

13:57.500 --> 13:59.959
and that night,

13:59.959 --> 14:03.500
I blew Wilmer Valderrama

14:03.500 --> 14:08.125
in the bathroom
at the after party.

14:08.125 --> 14:13.166
It was just
the most magical day.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.625
And I thought,

14:15.625 --> 14:17.667
"Oh, my God.

14:17.667 --> 14:22.583
Look at my life."
[laughs]

14:22.583 --> 14:23.333
And now?

14:23.333 --> 14:26.500
Oh, my God.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.625
Look at my life.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.333
By the way,

14:37.333 --> 14:39.750
thank you again
for taking my watch.

14:39.750 --> 14:43.041
It looks really good on you.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.250
And I'm telling you
it's worth

14:45.250 --> 14:48.083
so much more
than four weeks' pay.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.041
[chuckles]

14:49.041 --> 14:52.000
You did very well, my friend.

- Hello.

15:11.417 --> 15:13.542
Hey, Elliot.

15:13.542 --> 15:14.625
How's it going?

15:14.625 --> 15:16.500
I've been better.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.875
Yeah, look...

15:17.875 --> 15:19.583
[sighs]
I don't know what to say.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.875
I am so sorry.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.959
It was beyond stupid.

15:23.959 --> 15:25.250
I cannot disagree.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.417
If I could undo it, I would.
I swear.

15:28.417 --> 15:29.834
I feel terrible.

15:29.834 --> 15:31.458
Well, you should.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.583
What the hell was going through
that brain of yours?

15:33.583 --> 15:35.417
Nothing.
That's the problem.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.750
I just saw her,
and she was there, and--

15:37.750 --> 15:40.625
Yeah, well, I gotta say, I can't
fault your taste in women.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.083
That girl is something.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.083
I know, right?

15:43.083 --> 15:45.875
And she was doing yoga.

15:45.875 --> 15:46.959
I hear you.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.458
There's something about a woman

15:48.458 --> 15:50.250
who can put her heels
behind her ears.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.583
Thank you.

15:51.583 --> 15:54.041
I mean, how do you
say no to that?

15:54.041 --> 15:56.792
Funny thing, looking at you
with that girl in the box

15:56.792 --> 15:59.417
took me back to something
that happened to me

15:59.417 --> 16:01.917
which was not entirely
dissimilar.

16:01.917 --> 16:02.875
No kidding?

16:02.875 --> 16:04.291
This is years ago.

16:04.291 --> 16:05.208
Just off Times Square.

16:05.208 --> 16:08.291
Near Nathan's.
You remember Nathan's?

16:08.291 --> 16:09.667
Sure.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.625
I was walking down the street.

16:10.625 --> 16:14.208
And I saw this woman
in a phone booth.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.625
She was magnificent.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.709
A body to die for.

16:18.709 --> 16:21.667
Like a young Cyd Charisse.
You remember Cyd Charisse?

16:21.667 --> 16:22.709
Totally.

16:22.709 --> 16:23.667
Singing in the Rain?

16:23.667 --> 16:25.083
The Band Wagon--

16:25.083 --> 16:25.750
Band Wagon,  sure.

16:25.750 --> 16:26.625
Anyway, it was

16:26.625 --> 16:28.333
a hot summer night,

16:28.333 --> 16:30.875
even hotter in that phone booth
with the door closed.

16:30.875 --> 16:34.000
So I'm standing there,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.625
watching her,

16:35.625 --> 16:36.834
kind of in the shadows.

16:36.834 --> 16:40.458
And I notice this one

16:40.458 --> 16:42.625
little bead of sweat

16:42.625 --> 16:46.500
slowly rolling
down her bare shoulder.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.291
And she turns,

16:48.291 --> 16:51.875
and her eyes catch mine.

16:51.875 --> 16:54.250
It was this charged
erotic moment.

16:54.250 --> 16:57.000
And much like you
and your girl in the box,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.875
it led to some, uh,

16:59.875 --> 17:00.709
self-pleasuring,

17:00.709 --> 17:03.709
if you catch my drift.

17:03.709 --> 17:04.792
I'm catching it.

17:04.792 --> 17:06.208
Of course,

17:06.208 --> 17:08.667
my situation was
slightly different in that

17:08.667 --> 17:11.125
she had no idea
what was happening.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.792
When she looked down

17:12.792 --> 17:15.000
and saw what I was doing,
she let out a-a scream.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.625
It was so loud,
you could hear it

17:16.625 --> 17:17.834
through the glass
with the door closed.

17:17.834 --> 17:20.458
But that's all I needed.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.166
By the time the cops came,

17:22.166 --> 17:24.250
I was done, zipped up,
and halfway down 46th Street.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.166
Wow.

17:28.166 --> 17:31.291
You don't see
phone booths anymore.

17:31.291 --> 17:32.542
And they call that progress.

17:32.542 --> 17:33.625
Right.

17:33.625 --> 17:37.375
Anyway, the show.

17:37.375 --> 17:39.875
So...we're okay?

17:39.875 --> 17:42.041
Well, let us think about it.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.500
We'll discuss.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.458
But I'm really glad you called.

17:45.458 --> 17:46.625
Me too.

17:46.625 --> 17:48.333
Thank you so much.

be hosting a family show.
