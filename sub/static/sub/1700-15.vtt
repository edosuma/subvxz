WEBVTT

00:03.795 --> 00:05.004
Coffee.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.423
- Thank you.
- Cappuccino.

00:08.925 --> 00:11.677
And a nice hot cider for Monica.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.679
Aw, thank you.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.180
- Rach?
- Yeah?

00:15.348 --> 00:17.975
Why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

00:19.269 --> 00:20.436
Oh.

00:20.603 --> 00:21.937
Oh, heh.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.814
That's why.

00:24.566 --> 00:25.983
Sorry.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.752
Chandler?

01:27.253 --> 01:29.630
Miss Tedlock,
you're looking lovely today.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.383
May I say that is a very
flattering sleeve length on you?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.219
Yes.

01:35.386 --> 01:39.556
Well, Mr. Costilick would like you to stop
by his office at the end of the day.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.727
Oh, listen, if this is about those prank
memos, I had nothing to do with them.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.230
Really, nothing at all. Really.

01:46.564 --> 01:47.606
Nothing.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.945
Hey, you guys. You guys.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.948
Chandler's coming, and he says
he has this incredible news.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.534
So when he gets here,
let's all act like, you know...

01:58.701 --> 02:00.244
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:00.411 --> 02:03.038
Never mind.
But it was gonna be really good.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.791
- What's going on?
- What's up?

02:05.959 --> 02:08.460
It's a typical day at work.
I'm inputting my numbers...

02:08.627 --> 02:10.461
...and Big Al calls me into his office...

02:10.630 --> 02:13.632
...and tells me he wants to make me
processing supervisor.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.968
- That is great!
- Congratulations.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.387
So I quit.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.222
Why?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.641
Why?
This was supposed to be a temp job.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.727
Yeah, Chandler,
you've been there for five years.

02:25.895 --> 02:27.312
I know, but if I took it this...

02:27.480 --> 02:30.149
...it'd be like admitting
that this is what I actually do.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.608
So was it a lot more money?

02:31.776 --> 02:34.403
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be one of those guys...

02:34.571 --> 02:38.157
...that's in his office until 12:00 at night
worrying about the WENUS.

02:41.327 --> 02:42.619
"The WENUS"?

02:42.954 --> 02:46.665
Weekly estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.668
Oh, that WENUS.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.045
So, what are you gonna do?

02:52.213 --> 02:54.423
I don't know. That's the thing.
I don't know.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.675
I'm not gonna figure it out
working there.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.094
Oh! I have something you can do.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.513
I have this new massage client.
Steve.

03:03.224 --> 03:06.018
Anyway, um, he's opening up
a restaurant...

03:06.186 --> 03:09.021
...and he's looking for a head chef.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.983
Um, hi there.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.318
Hi.

03:14.485 --> 03:17.654
Oh, yeah, I know. You're a chef, I know,
and I thought of you first.

03:17.822 --> 03:21.200
But, um, Chandler's the one
who needs a job right now, so...

03:23.286 --> 03:26.163
Yeah, I just don't have a lot
of chefing experience.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.373
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.461
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Well, what kind of food is he looking for?

03:32.629 --> 03:35.631
He wants to do something eclectic,
so he's looking for someone...

03:35.798 --> 03:37.799
...who can, you know,
create the entire menu.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.885
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I know.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.678
So, what do you think?

03:43.306 --> 03:46.558
Thanks, Pheeb. I just don't really
see myself in a big white hat.

03:46.726 --> 03:47.851
Okay.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.313
Oh, Monica. Guess what?

04:01.741 --> 04:03.909
Can you see my nipples
through this shirt?

04:06.663 --> 04:09.748
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're still there.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.709
Where you going, Mr. Suit-ey Man?

04:12.877 --> 04:15.879
Well, I have an appointment
to see Dr. Robert Pilman...

04:16.047 --> 04:17.673
...career counselor-a-go-go.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.218
I added the "a-go-go."

04:21.386 --> 04:22.761
Career counselor?

04:22.929 --> 04:25.931
Hey, you guys all know
what you want to do.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.808
I don't.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.728
Hey, you guys in the living room
all know what you want to do.

04:31.896 --> 04:34.147
You know, you have goals.
You have dreams.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.649
I don't have a dream.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.236
Ah, the lesser known
"I Don't Have a Dream" speech.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.699
Oh, I love my life. I love my life.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.701
Brian's Song.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.830
The meeting with that guy went great?

04:49.998 --> 04:52.874
So great. He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.127
It's this cute little place on 10th Street.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.130
It's not too big, not too small.
It's just right.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.383
Was it formerly owned
by a blond woman and some bears?

05:02.427 --> 05:06.013
So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him
Monday night. Kind of like an audition.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.266
And Phoebe, he really wants you
to be here, which will be great for me.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.809
Because you can make yummy noises.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.270
- What are you gonna make?
- Yummy noises.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.607
And, Monica, what are you gonna make?

05:17.775 --> 05:20.319
I don't know. I don't know.
It's just gotta be so great.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.779
Oh! I know what you can make. I know.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.824
Oh, you should make that thing,
you know, with the stuff.

05:27.535 --> 05:31.455
You know that thing with the stuff?

05:32.540 --> 05:34.166
Okay, I don't know.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.170
Hey, guys, anyone know a good date place
in the neighborhood?

05:38.338 --> 05:43.342
Uh, how about Tony's? If you can finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

05:45.636 --> 05:46.928
Okay. Ahem.

05:47.096 --> 05:50.223
Hey, does anyone know a good place
if you're not dating a puma?

05:51.851 --> 05:54.811
- Who are you going out with?
- Oh, is this the bug lady?

05:54.979 --> 05:57.606
I love you, Ross.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.526
Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.112
She's curator of insects at the museum.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.282
So, what are you guys gonna do?

06:07.450 --> 06:10.619
Well, I just thought we'd go to dinner,
then bring her back to my place...

06:10.787 --> 06:13.330
...and I'd introduce her to my monkey.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.834
And he's not speaking metaphorically.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.340
- So back to your place?
- Uh-huh.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.509
You thinking maybe, heh-heh?

06:26.761 --> 06:30.180
Ahem, well, I don't know, heh-heh.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.766
I'm hoping heh-heh.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.144
I'm telling you,
that monkey's a chick magnet.

06:36.312 --> 06:40.857
She's gonna one look at his furry, cute
little face and it'll seal the deal.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.236
- Aah!
- Celia, don't worry.

06:44.404 --> 06:47.864
Celia, he's not gonna hurt you.
Soothing tones, Celia, soothing tones.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.825
- Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Aah!

06:50.034 --> 06:53.870
- Here, here. Marcel? Marcel?
- I can't stand this.

06:54.038 --> 06:57.374
- He's got his claws on my...
- Yeah, all right.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.884
Okay, try this salmon mousse.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.762
- Mm. Good.
- Yeah?

07:10.930 --> 07:13.390
Is it better than
the other salmon mousse?

07:14.142 --> 07:15.684
It's creamier.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.019
Yeah? Well, is that better?

07:18.187 --> 07:21.606
I don't know.
We're talking about whipped fish, Monica.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.818
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down,
you know?

07:30.950 --> 07:32.617
God, what happened to you?

07:32.785 --> 07:35.704
Eight and a half hours
of aptitude tests...

07:35.872 --> 07:40.333
...intelligence tests, personality tests,
and what do I learn?

07:40.918 --> 07:43.170
"You're ideally suited for a career
in data processing...

07:43.337 --> 07:45.714
...for a large multi-national corporation."

07:46.966 --> 07:50.385
That's so great, because you
already know how to do that.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.804
Can you believe it?

07:52.972 --> 07:56.475
Don't I seem like somebody who should
be doing something really cool?

07:56.642 --> 08:00.479
You know, I just always
pictured myself doing something...

08:00.855 --> 08:02.147
Something.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.400
Oh, Chandler, I know, I know.

08:05.943 --> 08:09.154
Oh, hey, you can see your nipples
through this shirt.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.577
Here you go.
Maybe this will cheer you up.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.247
Ooh, you know, um,
I had a grape about five hours ago...

08:19.415 --> 08:20.832
...so I better split this with you.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.920
It's supposed to be that small.
It's a pre-appetizer.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.173
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.761
Well, it is amusing.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.188
Hello? Oh, hi, Wendy.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.190
Yeah, 8:00.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.192
What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.861
Okay, great.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.155
All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.907
Ten dollars an hour for what?

08:54.075 --> 08:56.618
I asked a waitress at work
to help me out.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.662
Waitressing?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.288
Uh-oh.

09:01.249 --> 09:04.751
Ha, ha. Of course I thought of you.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.336
But...

09:06.504 --> 09:08.505
- But...
- But, but?

09:10.299 --> 09:14.970
But, you see, it's just this night
has to go just perfect, you know...

09:15.137 --> 09:19.349
...and, well, Wendy's more
of a professional waitress.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.351
Oh.

09:21.769 --> 09:24.396
I see. Yes. And I've sort of been
maintaining my amateur status...

09:24.564 --> 09:26.565
...so that I can waitress in the Olympics.

09:30.403 --> 09:34.823
You know, I don't mean to brag,
but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.870
Amuse-bouche?

09:58.055 --> 09:59.556
Talk to me.

10:01.767 --> 10:05.687
Okay, uh, ahem, a weird thing happened
to me on the train this morning...

10:05.855 --> 10:09.608
No, no, no. Talk dirty.

10:13.029 --> 10:16.239
- Wow. Here?
- Come on.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.866
Come on.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.701
Say something...

10:19.869 --> 10:21.286
...hot.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.581
- What?
- Uh...

10:24.749 --> 10:27.083
- What?
- Ooh.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.669
- What?
- Um...

10:29.837 --> 10:31.129
What?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.131
- What?
- Vulva.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.389
"Vulva"?

10:43.517 --> 10:45.810
All right, I panicked, all right?

10:45.978 --> 10:47.729
She took me by surprise.

10:47.897 --> 10:51.858
You know, but it wasn't a total loss.
I mean, uh, we ended up cuddling.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.903
Whoa, you cuddled? How many times?

10:56.364 --> 10:58.531
Shut up. It was nice. I just...

10:58.699 --> 11:01.785
I just don't think I'm the dirty-talking
kind of guy, you know?

11:01.952 --> 11:04.537
What's the big deal?
Just say what you want to do to her.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.748
Or what you want her to do to you.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.959
Or what you think other people
might be doing to each other.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.755
Look, I tell you what.
Try something on me.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.884
Please be kidding.

11:20.429 --> 11:21.763
Why not? Come on.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.642
Just close your eyes and tell me
what you'd like to be doing right now.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.774
Okay, I'm, uh...

11:33.150 --> 11:35.443
I'm in my apartment...

11:35.945 --> 11:36.945
Yeah, what else?

11:37.113 --> 11:39.906
That's it. You're not there.
We're not having this conversation.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.492
- All right. Look, I'll start, okay?
- Joey, please.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.078
Come on, come on.
All right, ready? Look.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.205
Oh, Ross.

11:49.083 --> 11:53.253
You get me so hot,
I want your lips on me now.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.422
See?

11:58.467 --> 12:01.720
- All right, now you say something.
- I, uh... I really don't think so.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.263
Come on.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.889
- You like this woman, right?
- Yeah.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.599
- You wanna see her again, right?
- Sure.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.894
Well, if you can't talk dirty to me,
how are you gonna talk dirty to her?

12:10.062 --> 12:12.439
Now tell me you want to caress my butt.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.571
Okay, turn around.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.907
I just don't want you staring at me
when I'm doing this.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.869
All right, all right.
I'm not looking. Go ahead.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.370
Okay.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.624
Ahem, I want, um...

12:31.792 --> 12:33.918
Okay, I want...

12:34.086 --> 12:35.336
...to feel...

12:35.504 --> 12:38.548
...your hot, soft skin with my lips.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.717
There you go.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.344
Keep going, keep going.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.346
I, uh...

12:48.017 --> 12:50.727
I want to take my tongue and...

12:58.444 --> 12:59.903
And...

13:00.070 --> 13:01.696
Say it.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.284
Say it!

13:07.077 --> 13:09.496
Run it all over your body...

13:12.166 --> 13:14.250
...until you're trembling with...

13:33.687 --> 13:35.396
With?

13:37.441 --> 13:39.567
- Funny story.
- You're not gonna believe this.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.152
It's okay. It's okay.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.697
I was always rooting for you
two kids to get together.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.577
Hey, while you were sleeping,
that guy from your old job called again.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.787
Oh. Again?

13:50.955 --> 13:53.540
- And again and again and again.
- And again.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.046
Hello? Heh. And again.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.297
Ah.

14:01.465 --> 14:05.218
Hey, Mr. Costilick.
How's life on the 15th floor?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.096
Yeah, I miss you too.

14:08.264 --> 14:12.392
Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens
from your own home, you know?

14:14.311 --> 14:15.562
Well, that's very generous.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.189
Uh, but look, this isn't about the money.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.400
You know? I need something
that's more than a job.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.111
I need something I really care about...

14:23.279 --> 14:26.489
And that's on top of the year-end
bonus structure you mentioned earlier?

14:26.657 --> 14:27.991
Your dream.

14:28.158 --> 14:31.452
Look, Al.
Al, I'm not playing hardball here, okay?

14:31.620 --> 14:34.831
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection.

14:34.999 --> 14:36.833
No... No, no. No, no.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.585
No, stop saying numbers!

14:38.752 --> 14:42.297
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy!
You got the wrong guy!

14:42.464 --> 14:43.965
I'll see you Monday!

14:47.553 --> 14:48.970
Ah.

14:56.061 --> 14:57.604
Huh?

14:57.771 --> 15:00.106
Wow. It's huge.

15:00.274 --> 15:02.650
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.945
Oh, this is a cube.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.780
Look at this.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.661
You have a window!

15:14.496 --> 15:15.830
Yes, indeedy.

15:15.998 --> 15:20.335
- With a beautiful view of...
- Oh, look. That guy's peeing.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.923
Okay. That's enough of the view.
All right, check this out.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.675
- Ahem. Okay, sit down here. Sit down.
- Okay.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.969
Okay, this is great. This is great.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.430
- Ahem. You ready?
- Yeah.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.350
Helen, could you come in here
for a moment?

15:40.898 --> 15:42.315
Thank you, Helen, that'll be all.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.819
Last time I do that. I promise.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.202
Wendy, we had a deal.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.496
Yeah, you promised.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.290
Wendy. Wendy. Wendy!

16:03.587 --> 16:05.213
Hmm, who was that?

16:07.049 --> 16:10.218
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.638
That's too bad.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.974
Bye-bye.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.559
- Ten dollars an hour.
- Nope.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.061
Twelve dollars an hour.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.856
Mon, I wish I could,
but I've made plans to walk around.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.319
You know, Rachel, when you ran out
on your wedding, I was there for you.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.407
I put a roof over your head,
and if that means nothing to you...

16:33.200 --> 16:35.034
Twenty dollars an hour.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.662
Done.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.170
- Well, hello. Welcome to Monica's.
- Hello.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.964
May I take your coat?

16:51.468 --> 16:53.469
- Hi, Steve.
- Hello, Monica.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.014
Hello, greeter girl.

16:56.473 --> 16:59.100
- This is Rachel.
- Yeah, okay.

16:59.810 --> 17:03.271
Mm, everything smells so delicious.

17:03.439 --> 17:07.775
You know, I can't remember a time
I smelled such a delicious combination of...

17:07.943 --> 17:09.484
Okay, smells.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.280
Well, it's a lovely apartment.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.074
Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?

17:15.242 --> 17:18.077
I was just being polite, but all right.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.330
What? What's up?

17:22.499 --> 17:26.711
In the cab on the way over,
Steve blazed up a doobie.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.464
What?

17:29.631 --> 17:32.216
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.718
Okay, okay, okay.

17:35.345 --> 17:38.097
Okay, I'm with you, Cheech. Okay.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.517
Is it dry in here?

17:44.563 --> 17:46.814
Let me get you some wine.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.650
Yeah, I think we're ready
for our first course too.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.652
Okay...

17:52.654 --> 17:55.031
These are rock shrimp ravioli...

17:55.199 --> 17:57.366
...in a cilantro ponzu sauce...
- Oh.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.911
...with just a touch of minced...

18:05.209 --> 18:06.417
...ginger.

18:07.252 --> 18:09.670
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.009
These are fantastic.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.804
Oh, gosh. I'm so glad you liked them.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.264
Like them?
I could eat a hundred of them.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.392
Oh. Well, um...

18:23.560 --> 18:25.686
That's all there is of these...

18:25.854 --> 18:29.273
...but in about eight and a half minutes,
we'll be serving some delicious tartlets.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.442
"Tartlets"? Heh.

18:31.610 --> 18:35.905
"Tartlets."

18:37.741 --> 18:39.784
Word has lost all meaning.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.085
Excuse me.
Can I help you with anything?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.671
You know, I don't know
what I'm looking for.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.730
Oh, cool. Taco shells.

19:12.442 --> 19:15.862
You know, these are... They are like a little
corn envelope, you know?

19:16.029 --> 19:18.656
You know what?
You don't want to spoil your appetite.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.159
Hey. Sugar-O's.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.120
You know, if you just wait
another six and a half minutes...

19:24.288 --> 19:26.998
Oh. Macaroni and cheese.
We gotta make this.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.963
No, we don't.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.257
Oh, okay.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.593
Oh, sorry.

19:42.764 --> 19:45.057
Yeah, why don't you
just have a seat here?

19:47.769 --> 19:49.228
Okay.

19:50.063 --> 19:52.106
Okay. Give me the Gummy Bears.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.567
Yeah, I... No.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.863
- Give them to me.
- All right, we'll share.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.532
- No. Give me the bears.
- Well, then you can't have any.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.409
- Give them to me.
- This is not worth it.

20:03.577 --> 20:07.997
Oh, oh! Bears overboard.
They're drowning.

20:08.749 --> 20:12.585
Hey, fellas. Grab onto a Sugar-O.
Save yourselves.

20:12.753 --> 20:17.798
Help! Help! I'm drowning. Help! Help!

20:17.966 --> 20:19.592
That's it, okay? Dinner is over.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.927
- What?
- "What"?

20:21.094 --> 20:22.511
- Why?
- "Why"?

20:22.679 --> 20:25.097
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity like this...

20:25.265 --> 20:28.559
...and you can't even wait four and a half
minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?

20:30.103 --> 20:31.520
Hey...

20:39.321 --> 20:40.947
What a tool.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.325
You don't want to work
for a guy like that.

20:44.493 --> 20:48.621
I know. It's just... I don't know,
I just thought that this was, you know, "it."

20:48.789 --> 20:50.748
Look, you'll get there.
You're an amazing chef.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.709
Yeah, you know all those yummy noises?
I wasn't faking.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.387
So, uh, how did it go with Celia?

21:04.554 --> 21:07.848
Oh, uh, I was unbelievable.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.976
All right, Ross.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.187
I was the James Michener of dirty talk.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.856
It was the most elaborate filth
you have ever heard.

21:16.024 --> 21:19.527
I mean, there were characters,
plot lines...

21:19.695 --> 21:21.320
...themes, a motif.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.240
At one point, there were villagers.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.660
Oh, and, uh...

21:28.829 --> 21:32.123
Well, um, you know, by the time
we finished with all the dirty talk...

21:32.291 --> 21:34.875
...it was kind of late
and we were both exhausted, so...

21:35.043 --> 21:37.670
- You cuddled.
- Yeah, which was nice.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.840
Do you guys want to try to catch
a late movie or something?

21:41.174 --> 21:43.134
Maybe, but shouldn't we wait
for Chandler?

21:43.844 --> 21:45.678
Whoa. Where the hell is he?

21:46.138 --> 21:48.180
Yes, Fran, I know what time it is...

21:48.348 --> 21:51.475
...but I'm looking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.854
Oh, really?
Well, let me tell you something.

21:55.022 --> 21:59.608
You will care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

22:02.612 --> 22:04.113
Whoa.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.084
- How's this?
- Eek!

22:17.252 --> 22:19.462
- Sorry. How about over here?
- Oh!

22:19.629 --> 22:21.589
See, now, that just means it's working.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.924
- Does this hurt?
- No.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.594
- How about this?
- Aah!

22:26.762 --> 22:27.970
There you go.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.354
Oh, I'm gonna throw up.
