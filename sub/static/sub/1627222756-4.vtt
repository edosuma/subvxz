sits out there, like,
is she really in charge

46:47.605 --> 46:49.955

46:49.999 --> 46:52.740

47:19.855 --> 47:23.771
one of the things that we talked
about is just this idea

be interesting to

47:33.781 --> 47:36.567

somebody who

47:36.610 --> 47:38.961

tactical mind,

47:39.004 --> 47:43.008
was probably
a really great commander,

disgruntled by the system

47:47.012 --> 47:49.928

in some ways.

were left behind.

not that uncommon.

very dramatic way to illustrate

the type of danger that they're
all in but Leah, too.

48:42.589 --> 48:45.027

there is a kind of

48:45.070 --> 48:47.638
a turning point for Leah
in that moment as well.

48:47.681 --> 48:51.033
Because it's one thing to be
inside the circle of love

48:51.076 --> 48:53.644
and to feel like she's
one of his favorites

48:53.687 --> 48:56.864

characters,

changed people and they do

pretty intense things.

49:35.120 --> 49:37.514
And, the question is,
who are the people

49:37.557 --> 49:39.037
that are gonna
stand up to that

49:39.081 --> 49:41.431
and who is just gonna try to
live with it

49:41.474 --> 49:45.826
and who is complicit in it
who is cheering it on?

49:45.870 --> 49:49.308
Daryl's just kind of
coming into this situation

49:49.352 --> 49:53.747
knowing very little about them
and he's still learning

49:53.791 --> 49:56.054
what all of it means
and where they all stand.

49:56.098 --> 49:58.230
And the big lesson
out of this is

49:58.274 --> 50:01.277
nobody's gonna stand up to
Pope easily.

50:01.320 --> 50:05.107
[Moaning, screaming]

50:05.150 --> 50:08.719
I think for some of them
it's a wake-up call

50:08.762 --> 50:12.679
to realize, like, how intense
the situation has gotten.

50:12.723 --> 50:15.421
I don't actually think
Pope has killed

50:15.465 --> 50:18.337
a lot of his own people
in this way.

50:18.381 --> 50:21.297
I think it's always been, like,
"It's us against the world."

50:21.340 --> 50:24.735
And now that he's put Leah
in a burning room,

50:24.778 --> 50:28.652
just threw one of these people
that she considers, like,

50:28.695 --> 50:32.090
a brother in the fire,
the equation is shifting.

50:32.134 --> 50:34.136
And I think there's a sense
of unease.

50:34.179 --> 50:37.661
For Daryl, all of this is intel
that he's taking in

50:37.704 --> 50:40.098
and he's realizing, like,
I've gotta tread very,

50:40.142 --> 50:41.752
very carefully here.

50:41.795 --> 50:43.710
He's in a dangerous situation.

50:43.754 --> 50:45.538
We are the chosen ones!

50:45.582 --> 50:48.106
We run into the battle.

50:48.150 --> 50:51.153
We run into the fire!

50:51.196 --> 50:53.242
Always.
