WEBVTT

00:06.207 --> 00:06.340
.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.275
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:08.376 --> 00:09.377
sexually based offenses

00:09.410 --> 00:12.113
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.382
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.415 --> 00:16.317
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.350 --> 00:17.585
are members of an elite squad

00:17.618 --> 00:19.820
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.323
These are their stories.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.395
- Mommy?
Mommy?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.666
- Honey.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.636
Honey, you've been going
over an hour.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.438
- [panting]
One more mile.

00:39.673 --> 00:43.043
[breathing heavily]

00:45.579 --> 00:47.581
[beeping]

00:51.585 --> 00:55.389
- I know I did wrong,
and I know I can do better.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.591
For me, but also for--

00:57.625 --> 01:01.429
for my one-year-old
niece, Jesse.

01:01.462 --> 01:05.166
I haven't met Jesse yet.
That's my own fault.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.568
But after she was born,
I realized that there was

01:07.601 --> 01:11.572
something much bigger than me
outside of these walls.

01:11.605 --> 01:15.376
And I trust in Jesus and
the mercy of this Parole Board

01:15.409 --> 01:18.679
to give me the chance
to look Jesse in the eye

01:18.712 --> 01:22.583
and tell her how proud I am of
her mother,

01:22.616 --> 01:25.619
my sister Amanda.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.624
- Your sister Kim
made parole

01:30.658 --> 01:32.593
and now she wants
to live with you.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.362
- I know it sounds crazy.
I should say no.

01:34.395 --> 01:35.429
- What are her options?

01:35.463 --> 01:37.331
- She can't leave the state,

01:37.365 --> 01:39.267
so it's either
my apartment or a shelter.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.602
- Amanda...

01:41.635 --> 01:42.836
That may not
be the worst place,

01:42.870 --> 01:46.607
considering the trouble that
this woman has gotten you into.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.378
- Women get raped
and killed in shelters.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.580
And Kim says
she's found religion.

01:52.613 --> 01:56.450
- Well, I hope so.

01:56.484 --> 02:00.721
Because if you cover
for her again,

02:00.754 --> 02:04.725
I will take your shield.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.764
[relaxed dance music]

02:10.798 --> 02:12.500
- [sighs]

02:12.533 --> 02:15.369
- Six in a row.
Damn.

02:15.403 --> 02:17.371
- [laughs]

02:17.405 --> 02:19.573
Another, Joe.
Get lucky number seven.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.575
[laughs]

02:21.609 --> 02:28.616
*

02:37.825 --> 02:42.296
- You just might be the most
gorgeous woman I've ever seen.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.580
- [panting]

03:14.328 --> 03:16.297
- Miller takes
a few steps back.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.432
[chanting]
Jenna! Jenna!

03:18.466 --> 03:21.502
Look at
that razor-sharp focus.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.806
[breathing heavily]

03:29.343 --> 03:32.713
[grunts]
Yes! Yes, yes.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.352
[siren blares]

03:40.421 --> 03:41.422
- Ma'am, are you all right?

03:41.455 --> 03:43.324
[police radio chatter]

03:43.357 --> 03:44.325
[panting]

03:44.358 --> 03:45.326
[sirens wailing]

03:45.359 --> 03:47.461
- 10-4,
she's running away.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.029
[tires screech]
- [hyperventilating]

03:49.062 --> 03:50.331
- Stop!

03:50.364 --> 03:51.865
- [laughs]

03:51.899 --> 03:53.567
- What happened to you?

03:53.601 --> 03:55.436
- I won!

03:55.469 --> 03:56.470
[laughs]

03:56.504 --> 04:01.342
- Dispatch, we're all fine.
- Copy that.

04:01.375 --> 04:05.045
- I won.
I won.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.281
Thank you.
[sobs]

04:09.783 --> 04:12.753
[dramatic music]

04:12.786 --> 04:19.793
*

04:56.964 --> 04:59.733
- Okay, Lieutenant.
Yeah, I'll be there in 20.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.807
Kim?

05:06.840 --> 05:07.908
Jesse?

05:07.941 --> 05:10.778
- Oh, we're right here.
- What--what were you doing?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.913
- Oh, we were just looking
at ourselves in the mirror.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.415
- Oh, hey.
- Weren't we, cutie pie?

05:14.448 --> 05:16.517
- Hi, baby.
Come on, baby.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.387
- You can trust me
with my niece, Amanda.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.921
- Can I?

05:20.954 --> 05:23.724
- Hey, mistakes happen
in life.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.058
The strength of your character
is determined

05:25.092 --> 05:26.894
by how you bounce back.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.363
- Yeah, save
the fortune cookie philosophy.

05:29.397 --> 05:31.064
I heard enough
at the parole hearing.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.467
And, Kim, just so you know,
there are ground rules

05:33.501 --> 05:35.369
if you're gonna be
staying here, right?

05:35.403 --> 05:38.038
- Oh, I know.
No drinking, no drugs,

05:38.071 --> 05:40.941
no staying out
past curfew, no men.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.444
- I'm serious--one screw-up,
and you're at that shelter.

05:43.477 --> 05:46.447
We're clear about that.
- Crystal.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.516
- Okay.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.484
- Hey, Jesse and I can wait
for the sitter.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.152
We got Frannie
to keep an eye.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.087
- That's not happening, Kim.

05:54.121 --> 05:58.826
Come here, baby.
Hey.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.029
- We're gonna have to earn
Mama's trust, aren't we?

06:02.062 --> 06:06.133
Put our faith in the Lord so
He'll see us through this, too.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.941
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
What are we looking at?

06:13.974 --> 06:16.477
- Vic, Jenna Miller,
housewife from Long Island,

06:16.510 --> 06:18.979
picked up jumping
around Manhattan at 3:30 a.m.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.013
- Jumping?
- Literally.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.583
From a rooftop.
High blood alcohol, no drugs.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.752
- Think she was raped?
- Well, she didn't disclose,

06:24.785 --> 06:27.588
but she had anal bleeding,
bruising, bite marks

06:27.621 --> 06:30.057
at the breasts
and to the thighs

06:30.090 --> 06:31.792
The SANE nurse called it in
just to be safe.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.160
- Is her husband in the picture?
- He's on his way,

06:33.193 --> 06:36.464
but I wanna get her story
before he shows up.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.098
- The nurse shouldn't have
called the police.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.501
- Okay, well, you don't
have to speak with us,

06:40.534 --> 06:44.004
but--but you have
serious injuries,

06:44.037 --> 06:46.073
consistent
with sexual assault.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.142
- Do you remember what happened
to you last night?

06:49.176 --> 06:50.778
- No.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.481
Uh...
Not really.

06:53.514 --> 06:56.149
- Were you meeting somebody
in the city?

06:56.183 --> 06:57.851
- No.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.487
I just came in for a drink.

06:59.520 --> 07:03.591
- Ms. Miller, whoever
inflicted these injuries--

07:03.624 --> 07:07.795
unless you wanted that
to happen--that's assault.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.530
Maybe even rape.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.964
- I wasn't meeting anybody.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.033
- I wanna see my wife!

07:13.066 --> 07:14.835
- Sir, please.
Have a seat.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.970
- Listen, if there's anything
that you wanna tell us,

07:17.004 --> 07:19.106
you know, without your husband
knowing, now would be the time.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.608
- I just wanna go home.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.042
- What should I
tell the husband?

07:22.075 --> 07:26.079
- Oh, it's okay.
I-I just needed to explain.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.015
- Okay.
Bring him in.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.117
- Jenna?
Hey! Sorry.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.852
What the hell happened?
- Sorry.

07:31.885 --> 07:32.920
- They told me
you're with the police?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.054
- Where--where's Sam?
Where is he?

07:34.087 --> 07:35.155
- Now you think about him.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.658
Sweetie, I've been worried sick,
you gone all night.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.960
- [crying]

07:39.993 --> 07:41.995
I was raped.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.432
- Wait, what?
- Mr. Miller.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.067
- If I could speak with you.
- Wait, what? What did you say?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.035
- Just for a minute,
by ourselves, alone.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.071
- Just--just--can we--
- Just for a minute.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.278
Look, I know that
this is upsetting,

07:58.311 --> 08:01.081
but we just wanna find out
what happened to your wife.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.617
And I need your help.
Okay?

08:03.651 --> 08:05.252
So where were you last night?

08:05.285 --> 08:06.987
- I was at home.
I was watching our son.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.256
- And your wife just went
into the city on her own?

08:09.289 --> 08:10.257
To meet a friend?

08:10.290 --> 08:11.592
- Yeah.
No, no, alone.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.425
That's what she told me.

08:12.459 --> 08:15.629
She does that
sometimes to unwind.

08:15.663 --> 08:18.098
- So she's under stress.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.901
- Well, yeah, our son's five.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.903
- Okay.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.038
- So she--she comes into
the city, she blows off steam,

08:25.072 --> 08:29.009
and, uh, the next day
she's herself again, you know?

08:29.042 --> 08:31.579
- So, um, I hate to
have to ask,

08:31.612 --> 08:34.114
but how's your marriage been?

08:34.147 --> 08:36.016
Any--any troubles at home?

08:36.049 --> 08:37.685
- No.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.119
I mean, we have arguments
like any couple,

08:39.152 --> 08:40.153
but we love each other.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.955
Okay, she ever talk to you
about these nights out?

08:41.989 --> 08:42.923
What she does?
Where she goes?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.692
- Look, I don't wanna be
the kind of husband

08:44.725 --> 08:45.926
who keeps tabs on his wife.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.895
What's gonna happen to her?
You gonna find this guy or what?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.630
- Well, we're certainly
gonna investigate.

08:49.663 --> 08:54.234
The problem is your wife
doesn't remember much.

08:54.267 --> 08:57.938
- Well, maybe, um,
maybe that's for the best.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.273
- If there's something you don't
want your husband to know,

09:00.307 --> 09:01.341
we get that.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.577
- I'm not having an affair.

09:03.611 --> 09:06.313
If that's what you think.

09:06.346 --> 09:09.282
- So what did happen?

09:09.316 --> 09:11.284
You--you said
you were raped.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.721
But if that's not
the whole story--

09:13.754 --> 09:17.124
- No.
I was raped.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.159
- Was it someone you knew?

09:19.192 --> 09:21.629
- No.

09:21.662 --> 09:25.298
He said his name was...

09:25.332 --> 09:27.167
Phil.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.235
- Where did you meet him?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.938
- A hotel bar.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.174
Somewhere downtown.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.309
We got a room.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.611
- Okay.

09:37.645 --> 09:40.113
- He hurt me.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.751
I said no.

09:43.784 --> 09:47.587
He forced himself inside me
from behind.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.125
- Let's do a rape kit
and go from there.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.668
- I know every vic lies about
something, but this woman--

10:00.701 --> 10:02.135
- Well, the husband's
hiding something too.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.671
- You make him
as a suspect?

10:03.704 --> 10:05.238
- No, there's too much
run around for domestic abuse.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.640
[cell phone vibrates]

10:06.674 --> 10:07.507
- But my money,
she picked up a stranger

10:07.540 --> 10:08.676
and things got rougher
than she wanted.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.278
- Which, if she didn't want it,
that means she was raped.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.782
- Either way, she's not
telling us the whole story.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.216
[clears throat]
Ah, police report says

10:16.249 --> 10:18.218
she was picked up
on Mercer and Broome.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.687
- Okay,
- So talk to unis.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.290
Right, have them canvas
hotel bars for now.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.358
We work around her,
not with her.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.298
- The manager said you guys
were looking for the bartender

10:31.331 --> 10:32.299
who works night shift.
Can I help you guys?

10:32.332 --> 10:38.138
- Yeah, uh, you see this woman
here last night?

10:38.171 --> 10:41.241
- Yeah, Barbie.
- Barbie?

10:41.274 --> 10:42.710
- I'm guessing
not her real name.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.177
She comes in
a few times a month.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.113
Never seen her
pay for a drink once.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.148
- Who paid for her drinks
last night?

10:48.181 --> 10:49.249
- Some rich douchebag.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.051
- All right, well, any chance
this rich douchebag

10:51.084 --> 10:53.821
used a credit card
with his real name?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.691
- I'm Michael Wheeler.
Those are my charges.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.126
Is there a problem?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.194
I didn't get any calls
from the credit card company.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.130
- There's a problem
but not with your credit card.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.867
- Here, you buy drinks
for that woman last night?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.736
- Yeah. Why?

11:08.769 --> 11:11.138
- She was sexually assaulted.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.339
- Not by me.
- Well, good.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.707
So we get a sample
of your DNA,

11:13.741 --> 11:15.342
it's not gonna
match her rape kit?

11:15.375 --> 11:18.078
- Wait, wait,
she's saying I raped her?

11:18.111 --> 11:19.046
I'm not surprised.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.883
Biggest pain in the ass hooker
I ever met.

11:22.916 --> 11:26.153
- You're telling us that--
that she's a prostitute.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.789
- Are you guys gonna jam me up
on a solicitation charge?

11:28.822 --> 11:30.357
- Tell us what happened,
unless you want us

11:30.390 --> 11:34.494
to jam you up
on a rape charge.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.765
- [sighs]
Okay, this woman, Barbie,

11:37.798 --> 11:41.068
comes on to me,
asking if I want a date.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.370
I get a room, lay out 500.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.838
We go at it.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.439
And she starts crying.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.809
I'm being "too rough."

11:48.842 --> 11:52.412
I told her,
"That's what I'm paying for."

11:52.445 --> 11:55.215
So, yeah.
She's a prostitute.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.085
Did she forget to mention
that detail?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.322
[knock at door]

12:04.224 --> 12:05.458
- This isn't a good time,
detectives.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.426
- You're gonna have to
make time.

12:06.459 --> 12:10.097
We found Phil.
Is that the man that raped you?

12:10.130 --> 12:12.499
- Yes.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.935
What did he say?
- He said that you--

12:14.968 --> 12:16.369
that he paid you for sex

12:16.403 --> 12:19.239
and that you were
working as an escort.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.808
- Is that true?

12:20.841 --> 12:23.210
- [sighs]

12:23.243 --> 12:24.812
Yes.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.347
- And your husband
doesn't know.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.349
- I know this sounds bad.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.384
I can explain it.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.288
About a year ago,
I was at a bar.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.290
This guy hit on me.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.558
I went for it.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.293
And when we were done,
he just left, like,

12:40.327 --> 12:41.494
200 bucks
on the dresser,

12:41.528 --> 12:44.297
and I-I-I was shocked.

12:44.331 --> 12:47.234
And then I was thrilled.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.401
[sighs]

12:48.435 --> 12:49.837
I guess I--
I got hooked.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.905
- Is this something
you do often?

12:51.939 --> 12:53.974
- Once in a while.
I know it's wrong.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.542
- Jenna.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.510
Not here to judge you.

12:57.544 --> 13:01.448
But you need to be
completely honest with us.

13:01.481 --> 13:05.252
- Okay.
This guy raped me.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.854
I did--I didn't even
take the money.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.289
I just ran out of there.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.390
Chad?

13:10.423 --> 13:11.925
- Hey.
What's going on?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.961
- You know, we just have
a few more questions.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.528
- I thought you were
putting Sam to sleep.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.530
- I hope we aren't
being too loud.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.999
- Jenna, we gotta tell them
the truth.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.401
They're gonna find out,
eventually.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.402
- Find out what?

13:22.435 --> 13:24.504
- [sighs]

13:24.537 --> 13:28.275
Jenna is--she's
an Olympic-level pole vaulter.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.377
The world record holder.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.312
What happened to her
is tabloid news.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.381
- Wait, you competed in Rio?

13:34.414 --> 13:36.216
- I didn't make the team
on a technicality.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.485
But four years from now,
in Tokyo--

13:38.518 --> 13:40.620
I'm the front-runner
for gold.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.957
So, I mean, the training,
the marketing--

13:43.991 --> 13:45.993
It--it's already started.

13:50.931 --> 13:55.568
But if any of this about
my personal life goes public,

14:06.646 --> 14:06.779
.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.048
- Jenna Miller's going
for her third attempt at 4.85

14:10.117 --> 14:12.152
to qualify for Team USA.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.921
It's all riding on this jump.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.923
Looks like
she's clearing it.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.390
Yes, it's good.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.892
[crowd roars]
Wait, hold on.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.028
The judge is red-flagging it.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.397
The pole may have slightly
dislodged the bar on this jump.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.934
That means that
the world-record holder,

14:26.967 --> 14:30.670
Jenna Miller, won't be joining
Team USA this summer.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.306
And this is really going to
hurt USA's chances for a gold.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.943
- Okay, so Jenna Miller's jump
was disqualified

14:35.976 --> 14:37.677
because of a technicality,
which is too bad

14:37.710 --> 14:39.612
because she won gold twice
at the Internationals.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.015
She was the three-time winner at
the Outdoor World Championship.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.917
- She's the front runner
for the next Olympics

14:43.951 --> 14:45.018
which makes her hesitant
to be truthful

14:45.052 --> 14:47.287
about leading her double life.
- What double life?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.689
- She has been moonlighting
as an escort.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.557
- Excuse me?

14:50.590 --> 14:51.791
- Okay, I was
just getting to that.

14:51.824 --> 14:56.063
Jenna admitted to us that she's
been prostituting herself.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.165
And she was raped by a john.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.466
- And we tracked him down.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.168
Michael Wheeler,
he's a hedge fund guy.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.170
He admits to having sex,
he admits to getting her off--

15:03.203 --> 15:05.072
- But he says he paid
for what he got.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.140
- What he took.
By force.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.376
- But it doesn't sound like
Jenna's willing to go forward.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.212
- Because she's afraid
of publicity ruining her career

15:12.245 --> 15:14.281
and her husband finding out
what she does

15:14.314 --> 15:16.083
on these girl trips
to the city.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.251
- I'm sure she is, but I can't
make a case like this

15:18.285 --> 15:19.486
without the victim's
cooperation.

15:19.519 --> 15:20.487
- Wheeler didn't flinch.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.956
It's probably not his first time
raping a hooker.

15:22.990 --> 15:24.958
- So let's look at
escort agencies,

15:24.992 --> 15:26.326
mandatory reporting
with the same M.O.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.361
- My first press case
was a prostitute rape.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.462
I know the drill.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.964
But a guy like this is gonna
put up a better fight.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.332
And a more expensive one, too.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.068
- And that's why we have you.

15:36.236 --> 15:37.704
- Must be nice
being a millionaire.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.273
Wheeler racks up over 30 grand
a month on drinks, dinner,

15:40.307 --> 15:42.175
miscellaneous
entertainment fees.

15:42.209 --> 15:45.012
- Code for escort services
and strip clubs.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.413
So he's sleazy.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.281
Okay, and he raped Jenna?

15:48.315 --> 15:51.018
- But you don't have
a lot of sympathy for her.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.286
- She has a son, she's got
a husband who loves her.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.222
Why throw that away?
- Yeah, but it can't be easy.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.324
You know, being an athlete,
competing at that level.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.458
You know, that's a lot
of pressure.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.761
- Hey, we all have
a lot of pressure.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.031
[knocking]
- Hi.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.070
- Hey, am I interrupting?
- Uhh--

16:10.103 --> 16:12.272
- Hey, Sonny.
- Hey, hey.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.074
- Why are you here, Kim?
- Oh, I know

16:14.107 --> 16:17.010
I should have called,
but I was in the neighborhood

16:17.044 --> 16:18.145
and I thought
I'd just stop by.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.381
I had my first meeting
with my parole officer today.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.283
- How'd it go?
- It went great.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.452
Actually, we talked about
my getting a job,

16:25.485 --> 16:27.054
maybe going back to school.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.289
- You can't just show up
at the precinct, Kim.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.759
- I know.
I'm sorry, I--

16:32.792 --> 16:35.028
I just wanted to tell you
that things went well today.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.163
- [stammers]
- You can be happy

16:36.196 --> 16:38.165
about that, right?
- Just go home.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.468
Okay?

16:43.803 --> 16:46.539
- Okay.
Bye, Sonny.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.348
- What?

16:55.382 --> 16:57.317
- Just seems like
she's trying, that's all.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.386
- Yeah, but that's what
I'm scared of.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.154
The calm before the storm.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.223
I can't have my life
blowing up right now.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.358
Not with Jesse.
- That was your sister?

17:05.392 --> 17:08.395
- Yeah, it's fine.
- All right.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.397
I tracked down
some working girls who say

17:10.430 --> 17:12.765
they know Michael Wheeler.

17:15.168 --> 17:18.071
- That's Wheeler.
Calls himself "Phil."

17:18.105 --> 17:20.207
He's a real pervert.
My booker cut him off.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.309
- Why's that?

17:22.342 --> 17:23.576
- 'Cause he thought
if he was paying

17:23.610 --> 17:24.644
he could do
whatever he wanted.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.479
- Right, so he did things
that you didn't want.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.547
- Something like that.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.382
- Was he rough?
- Real rough.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.284
I mean, that was
part of his thing.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.186
Hitting, slapping.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.621
The more you said no,
the more he liked it.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.256
- You call the police?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.358
- [chuckles]
Cops?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.793
Why?
- 'Cause he raped you.

17:40.827 --> 17:44.164
- No such thing
in this line of work.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.632
- So you're saying
Wheeler raped you.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.600
- Yeah.
He paid for straight sex,

17:47.634 --> 17:49.536
but then he just did
whatever he wanted.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.538
I bled for days.
- Did you report it?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.373
Or go to the hospital?
- No.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.842
I asked him for five grand.
He paid up.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.511
But if you need me
to testify, I will.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.647
I hate that bastard.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.116
- We found a dozen escorts
who had either been

18:03.150 --> 18:05.118
physically assaulted
or outright raped

18:05.152 --> 18:06.319
by Michael Wheeler.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.520
- None of them
called the cops.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.822
None of them did a rape kit.
- The only woman I talked to

18:09.856 --> 18:12.259
who was willing
to testify got paid off.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.126
- Which, while showing
a pattern,

18:13.160 --> 18:15.162
would make
her testimony impeachable.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.896
- This guy
is a serial predator.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.398
- He targets sex workers
because he thinks

18:18.431 --> 18:20.267
he can get away with it.
- [sighs]

18:20.300 --> 18:21.201
- I hear you, he's despicable.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.535
- Which brings us
back to Jenna Miller.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.171
We got a rape kit,
we have an outcry.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.339
Can't we compel her to testify?
- Well, we can.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.308
But if she won't cooperate,
it's a waste of time.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.177
- I can't imagine she wants
to get on the stand

18:30.210 --> 18:31.311
and tell the whole world
and her husband

18:31.344 --> 18:32.412
that she's
a part-time hooker.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.447
- Maybe she doesn't have to.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.650
Let's try to convince her
to do a controlled meet.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.319
- Michael Wheeler's
done this before?

18:39.352 --> 18:42.655
- Multiple times, and he's hurt
some of these women badly.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.291
- So get one of them
to testify.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.926
- It's--it's not
that simple.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.895
There's no evidence; they didn't
come forward at the time.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.231
- Oh, yeah, they thought
they wouldn't be believed

18:51.264 --> 18:52.932
'cause they're hookers.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.535
Wheeler really is a bully.
- And that's why we wanna

18:55.568 --> 18:57.904
go after him.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.606
- This can't go to trial.
He'll find out.

18:59.639 --> 19:03.910
- Well, Jenna, there may--
there may be another way.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.479
Would you be willing
to call Michael Wheeler

19:06.513 --> 19:08.448
and see if he would meet you

19:08.481 --> 19:10.183
and wear a wire?

19:10.217 --> 19:11.651
- Means like work undercover?
- Kind of,

19:11.684 --> 19:13.886
but we would talk you
through the whole thing.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.655
And if there's
any admission of guilt,

19:15.688 --> 19:17.590
that would help us
resolve the case

19:17.624 --> 19:20.227
and force him to take a plea.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.364
- Can we do it, like, now?

19:35.642 --> 19:39.512
- Phil.
Thanks for coming.

19:39.546 --> 19:42.215
- How much?
Give me a number.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.416
- What do you mean?

19:43.450 --> 19:46.219
- You called the cops on me.
This is obviously a shakedown.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.221
- It's not this guy's
first time making a payoff.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.956
- She just needs
to keep him talking.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.424
- She's doing all right,
Rollins.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.425
She's doing all right.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.228
- How much?
15 grand?

19:55.262 --> 19:58.231
- [scoffs]
I don't want your money.

19:58.265 --> 20:01.568
I want an apology.
- For what?

20:01.601 --> 20:03.603
- For what you did to me.

20:03.636 --> 20:07.374
- [chuckles]
Yeah, right.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.542
So if I do apologize,
that's it?

20:09.576 --> 20:11.478
You'll back off?

20:11.511 --> 20:14.381
- Just say it.
Say it, you owe me that.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.715
Just say it,
you son of a bitch.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.049
Just say it!
- Jenna!

20:17.083 --> 20:19.252
Hey, what the hell's going on?
- Is that who I think it is?

20:19.286 --> 20:22.255
- This is not good.
- Let's go.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.525
- Excuse me.
What's going on here?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.960
- Back off, all right?
She's my wife.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.497
- Your wife's a hooker.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.499
- NYPD!
- Hey, everybody back down.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.434
- You called the cops again,
you crazy bitch?

20:34.467 --> 20:35.802
- You're going down.
- You're the one?

20:35.835 --> 20:37.804
You raped my wife?
- You can't rape a whore.

20:37.837 --> 20:38.805
[punch landing]
[grunting]

20:38.838 --> 20:39.806
[crowd chattering]

20:39.839 --> 20:43.810
- No, no, no!
- You okay?

20:43.843 --> 20:46.746
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.614
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm great.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.550
My whole life just went up
in flames.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.332
- No one deserves
to be raped, Jenna.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.066
- [sighs] I put myself
in the situation.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.568
- Okay, but--
but you know what?

21:08.601 --> 21:09.936
We need to talk about
you and your husband.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.971
He's pretty angry right now.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.606
Do you feel safe
going home with him?

21:13.640 --> 21:15.808
- What--do I--
like I think he's gonna hit me?

21:15.842 --> 21:17.944
No.
- Okay, we just have to ask.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.946
- Is he in trouble
for punching that guy?

21:19.979 --> 21:25.918
- Not with us.
We want Wheeler behind bars.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.388
- Oh, God, if this
goes to trial,

21:28.421 --> 21:31.424
it makes who I am
and what I've done

21:31.458 --> 21:34.594
public record.

21:34.627 --> 21:38.931
- Most mainstream media outlets
won't publish the victim's name,

21:38.965 --> 21:41.401
but there are no guarantees.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.702
- I know he's hurt
other women.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.070
I wanna do the right thing.
I--I just--

21:44.103 --> 21:47.840
I can't risk the publicity.
[sighs]

21:47.874 --> 21:50.643
- I get it.

21:50.677 --> 21:54.113
- I gotta talk to Chad.

21:54.146 --> 21:59.051
Tokyo in 2020 is his dream
as much as mine.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.753
- So what happens now?

22:00.787 --> 22:02.722
- Talk to the DA's office
and find out

22:02.755 --> 22:04.824
if there's enough to prosecute.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.960
- I'd have to testify.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.096
- It's not worth it.

22:10.129 --> 22:11.698
We can't change what happened.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.766
- A crime was committed.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.468
So what happens next
is not entirely up to you.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.737
- That's easy for you to say.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.939
You're not married to her.

22:19.972 --> 22:22.642
You didn't dedicate
your entire life to her.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.748
- That was rough.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.017
Husband finding out
his wife's a prostitute.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.420
- Every relationship
has secrets, Carisi.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.754
- That's why I'm happy
I'm single.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.023
- Yeah. I get it.

22:37.056 --> 22:40.827
- Hey, everything okay
with you and Tucker?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.762
- We got something, Liv.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.864
Maybe a way to make the case
without using Jenna.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.065
- A witness?
- I went through

22:46.098 --> 22:47.400
her phone records
from that night.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.768
One call to her home
at 8:30 p.m.,

22:48.801 --> 22:49.936
then nothing for four hours.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.805
But at 1:20 a.m., she makes
a call to a New York cell.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.407
She speaks to him
for 17 minutes.

22:54.441 --> 22:56.409
- We traced the call
to Derek Kaller.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.511
He's one of the biggest
sports agents in the business.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.880
He represents players
on the Knicks and the Mets.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.783
- And Olympic medalists
that look like models.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.952
17 minutes?

23:05.985 --> 23:08.988
That's enough time
to disclose a rape.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.861
- Yes, Jenna Miller
is a client.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.696
- When was the last time
you spoke to her?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.131
- Maybe a few days ago?

23:19.165 --> 23:21.067
- What'd you two talk about?

23:21.100 --> 23:23.870
- Business.
What's going on here?

23:23.903 --> 23:26.873
- What'd you two talk about
at 1:20 a.m. two nights ago?

23:26.906 --> 23:29.008
- Oh, so that's what this is?

23:29.041 --> 23:34.013
Look, she was drunk.
She called me upset.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.783
I told her to go home,
sleep it off.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.719
- She say anything else?
- Look, I'm her agent.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.021
I am obligated
to protect her privacy.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.757
- We're investigating
a rape allegation.

23:48.127 --> 23:52.131
- Okay, she did say she picked
up a man and that he...

23:52.164 --> 23:53.933
raped her.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.568
But she said
a lot of things.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.904
I thought she was
hysterical, irrational.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.238
- Did you tell her
to call the police?

23:59.271 --> 24:02.909
- Look, I didn't think
she meant it.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.978
- She ended up
in the hospital.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.047
- She didn't tell me.
Neither did Chad.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.248
- Yeah, 'cause they didn't
want this going public.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.050
They were afraid that she was
gonna lose her endorsements.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.820
- Yeah, they're right.
Look, she is one of

24:13.853 --> 24:16.122
the most naturally gifted
athletes around.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.825
Plus she's sweet and gorgeous.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.260
With a near miss going to Rio,
she has the world's sympathy.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.596
She's looking at millions.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.132
- And you're looking at
10%, right?

24:26.165 --> 24:29.802
- I have a lot of clients,
Detective.

24:29.836 --> 24:32.839
Jenna was assaulted.
Of course I'm outraged.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.141
I want what's best for her.
- So you're willing to testify

24:35.174 --> 24:38.010
that she disclosed to you?

24:38.044 --> 24:39.078
- When would the trial
take place?

24:39.111 --> 24:41.914
- As soon we arrest
and the judge sets the date.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.583
- Any way to postpone it?

24:43.616 --> 24:45.985
- For how long?
- Until after Tokyo?

24:46.018 --> 24:49.021
- Four years?
No, it doesn't work like that.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.290
DA's moving now.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.826
- Derek Kaller
has agreed to testify?

24:53.860 --> 24:55.161
- Yes. He sent me
an email this morning.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.129
He's coming over today
to go over his testimony.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.631
- But that night,
when I talked to him,

24:58.665 --> 25:02.268
he told me to just go home,
not to tell anybody.

25:02.301 --> 25:03.135
That it could
damage my image.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.171
- We're past that
right now, Jenna.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.173
- Kaller's all about
protecting his investment.

25:07.206 --> 25:10.877
I'm surprised he agreed.
[cell phone vibrating]

25:10.910 --> 25:12.211
- Oh.

25:12.244 --> 25:15.582
I get it.

25:15.615 --> 25:19.919
He just dumped me.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.921
"I want you to get
the help you need.

25:21.954 --> 25:22.922
"In the meantime,
it's best that

25:22.955 --> 25:26.158
"we terminate our
professional relationship.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.160
"Your personal life is
clearly incompatible

25:28.194 --> 25:31.197
with the values this firm
and its clients demand."

25:36.202 --> 25:38.004
- I'm so sorry, Jenna.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.572
- So that's it.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.207
That's it.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.942
My--my endorsements.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.578
My--my--my career.

25:45.612 --> 25:48.080
It's over.

25:48.114 --> 25:51.083
I'm a tabloid headline.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.885
"The Pole Vault Hooker."

25:52.919 --> 25:54.654
- We're gonna find
a way out of this.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.088
- No, we won't!

25:56.122 --> 26:00.960
There's no coming back
from something like this.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.262
And then that--
that bastard Wheeler,

26:03.295 --> 26:08.935
he just gets away with this?
- Not if you testify.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.971
Not if you
look him in the eye,

26:12.004 --> 26:14.874
and tell that jury
what he did to you.

26:22.214 --> 26:25.618
- I'm in.
You have my word.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.355
I want him to suffer
like I'm suffering.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.898
goes on trial today.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.299
Wheeler is accused
of raping

26:40.332 --> 26:42.702
world-class pole vaulter
Jenna Miller.

26:42.735 --> 26:46.372
- Miller had been seen
as the future face of Team USA,

26:46.405 --> 26:49.642
until a rape investigation
uncovered her secret life

26:49.676 --> 26:52.745
of prostitution.
- The athletic community...

26:52.779 --> 26:53.846
- There she is. Jenna!
- Jenna!

26:53.880 --> 26:55.648
- Jenna, answer a few questions?
- Jenna, will you be

26:55.682 --> 26:56.849
censured by the Committee?

26:56.883 --> 26:58.084
- Ms. Miller isn't answering
any questions.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.986
- How do you expect
to win this case?

27:00.019 --> 27:01.287
- And I'm not answering
any questions, either.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.989
- Ms. Miller?
- Is it true she was paid

27:03.022 --> 27:06.726
for rough sex?
- Except for that one.

27:06.759 --> 27:09.361
Paid or not paid,
no means no.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.997
Consent can be revoked
at any time.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.865
- Ms. Miller, can we get
a comment from you?

27:12.899 --> 27:15.868
- Just try to ignore them.
- The press used to love me.

27:15.902 --> 27:18.738
Hypocrites.
- Don't look back.

27:20.773 --> 27:23.776
Jenna Miller was taken to
the ER with bite marks

27:23.810 --> 27:25.945
on her breasts and her thighs.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.414
She was bleeding, all injuries
consistent with sexual assault.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.016
- Did you talk to Jenna
at the hospital?

27:30.049 --> 27:32.852
- Yes. She said that
she had been raped.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.754
- Did Jenna tell you
that she had been

27:34.787 --> 27:36.689
offered money
for the sexual encounter?

27:36.723 --> 27:38.758
- No, we found that out
subsequently,

27:38.791 --> 27:40.092
from the defendant.
- Did she actually

27:40.126 --> 27:41.427
take the money
the defendant offered her?

27:41.460 --> 27:43.763
- She did not.
She said the defendant

27:43.796 --> 27:46.799
got so rough with her,
that she ran out of the room

27:46.833 --> 27:48.768
and never--
- Objection. Hearsay.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.770
- Sustained.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.039
- Nothing further.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.908
- So, Lieutenant,
you are saying that the victim

27:55.942 --> 27:57.977
lied about being paid for sex

27:58.010 --> 27:59.879
and the fact that she was
an Olympic athlete?

27:59.912 --> 28:01.981
- It's not uncommon
for victims

28:02.014 --> 28:05.451
to omit details of their story
to protect loved ones--

28:05.484 --> 28:07.987
- So are you are saying
she lied, correct?

28:08.020 --> 28:10.022
- I'm saying that she left out
parts of the story.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.958
- Which means she lied.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.460
And the injury she sustained,
isn't it possible

28:14.493 --> 28:16.462
that a prostitute--
someone who gets paid

28:16.495 --> 28:18.798
to have sex for a living--
- Objection.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.399
- Get to it, Mr. Varma.

28:20.432 --> 28:23.035
- Isn't it possible that
these injuries are consistent

28:23.069 --> 28:25.805
with consensual,
albeit physical, sex?

28:25.838 --> 28:28.074
- In my opinion, no.

28:28.107 --> 28:31.143
- You're a police officer.
Not a doctor. Correct?

28:31.177 --> 28:33.913
- I've been an SVU detective
for 17 years.

28:33.946 --> 28:37.483
- Which means you are qualified
to investigate rape cases,

28:37.516 --> 28:39.819
not evaluate medical injuries.

28:39.852 --> 28:44.791
Nothing further.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.893
- So were you soliciting sex

28:46.926 --> 28:49.996
on the night
you met the defendant?

28:50.029 --> 28:52.098
- Not exactly soliciting.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.433
I was at a bar,
having a few drinks

28:54.466 --> 28:57.503
and he--
the defendant--

28:57.536 --> 29:00.139
started flirting with me.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.942
It felt good.
[chuckles]

29:02.975 --> 29:05.778
I like when men notice me.

29:05.812 --> 29:08.014
You know, I'm so used
to being an athlete.

29:08.047 --> 29:11.083
It's nice to be noticed
just as a woman.

29:11.117 --> 29:14.787
But what I'm trying
to say is...

29:14.821 --> 29:17.023
I like the attention.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.458
We got a room.
- Okay.

29:19.491 --> 29:23.495
Did you tell him that he had to
pay you to have sex with you?

29:23.529 --> 29:27.867
- No. He just assumed
that was the deal.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.869
And I went along with it.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.103
- So you got a room.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.139
- What happened next?

29:33.172 --> 29:37.844
- We started having sex.

29:37.877 --> 29:42.581
Then he started getting rough.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.952
He started hitting me.

29:48.554 --> 29:54.293
I told him no,
that I wanted him to stop.

29:54.326 --> 29:57.463
And that made him
more aggressive.

29:57.496 --> 30:01.067
And then he started to do,
um, other things.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.234
- Other things like what?

30:02.268 --> 30:04.103
- I, um--

30:04.136 --> 30:08.607
I told him I didn't want
to have...

30:08.640 --> 30:12.044
anal sex.

30:12.078 --> 30:17.116
And he, uh--
he started laughing

30:17.149 --> 30:20.519
and then he--he--he--

30:20.552 --> 30:21.787
he did it anyway.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.323
- So you told him you absolutely
did not want to have anal sex,

30:24.356 --> 30:27.626
but he did it anyway.
- Yes.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.629
And when he was done,
he threw money at me.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.901
I didn't take it.
I was--I was hurt.

30:34.934 --> 30:38.337
And I was--
I was bleeding, it's--

30:38.370 --> 30:40.907
I just ran out of the room.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.575
Eventually,
the police picked me up

30:43.609 --> 30:46.045
and took me to the ER.

30:46.078 --> 30:50.216
And then the SVU detectives--
I--I told them what happened.

30:50.249 --> 30:55.087
And, um--

30:55.121 --> 30:56.255
I'm ashamed about
what I did,

30:56.288 --> 30:58.958
but I'm not ashamed
that I was raped.

31:01.994 --> 31:02.995
And I want everyone
to hear my story

31:03.029 --> 31:06.032
so this man can never hurt
another woman again.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.536
- Thank you.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.375
- You didn't make it to Rio.

31:16.408 --> 31:18.177
Is it fair to say

31:18.210 --> 31:20.246
you were virtually unknown
to the public

31:20.279 --> 31:23.149
before you falsely accused
my client of this crime?

31:23.182 --> 31:25.051
- Objection, relevance.

31:25.084 --> 31:28.020
- I'm getting to it, Your Honor.
- Get there quicker, Mr. Varma.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.221
- Happy to.

31:29.255 --> 31:32.124
This is all just an elaborate
publicity stunt, isn't it?

31:32.158 --> 31:34.293
Once my client outed you
as a prostitute,

31:34.326 --> 31:36.128
your career was over.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.964
So you accused him of rape.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.631
And now you are hoping
to capitalize

31:39.665 --> 31:42.401
on your newfound
and sordid celebrity status.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.670
- No, I would never want
this kind of publicity.

31:44.703 --> 31:47.039
- Everybody is talking
about you.

31:47.073 --> 31:50.276
Everybody is looking at you.
Looking at your body.

31:50.309 --> 31:55.181
You just said, you like being
seen "as a woman."

31:55.214 --> 31:58.150
You enjoy the attention.
- Yes, I do.

31:58.184 --> 32:01.020
- And yet,
despite all your hard work,

32:01.053 --> 32:03.155
you didn't qualify
for the team.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.624
- My jump was disqualified
on a technicality.

32:05.657 --> 32:07.193
It was unfair.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.395
I'll be back,
four years from now in Tokyo.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.965
- Four years from now,
when you're what, 30?

32:12.999 --> 32:16.102
If you do qualify--
if the governing body

32:16.135 --> 32:18.304
doesn't ban you
for being a prostitute.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.973
But I suppose my real point
here is:

32:21.007 --> 32:21.940
your body
is never gonna look

32:21.974 --> 32:24.210
as good as it does right now.
- Objection.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.145
- I--I would actually
like to answer that.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.414
My body will look great
four years from now.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.250
Better.
Because I work hard.

32:31.283 --> 32:36.122
Harder than you can imagine.
- Oh, for a change,

32:36.155 --> 32:37.323
I believe you there.

32:37.356 --> 32:41.193
I believe it is
incredibly hard work.

32:41.227 --> 32:42.428
That's why you wanted
to show it off

32:42.461 --> 32:44.430
on the night that you met
Michael Wheeler.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.065
- Objection.
Badgering.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.699
- I'm following a line of
defense here, Your Honor.

32:47.733 --> 32:50.136
- Overruled.
Witness may answer.

32:50.169 --> 32:53.105
- Yes, I wanted to--
to--to show off--

32:53.139 --> 32:54.340
- And then he rejected you.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.075
He wasn't as impressed
by your body

32:56.108 --> 32:57.143
as you wanted him to be.

32:57.176 --> 33:00.746
He said that you were
too muscular, too masculine.

33:00.779 --> 33:04.116
And that's when you cried rape,
to get back at him.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.751
- Objection.
- How dare you use--

33:05.784 --> 33:07.419
How dare you--who do you
think you are?

33:07.453 --> 33:09.355
He said that he loved my body.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.357
Everyone tells me
that they love my body.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.492
I am 5'9, 112 pounds.

33:13.525 --> 33:16.028
I bench press 150 pounds.
- Your Honor, I need a recess.

33:16.062 --> 33:18.330
- I squat 225, ten reps.
I mean, my body is perfect.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.798
- Ms. Miller, what are you--
- It looks perfect!

33:19.831 --> 33:22.234
[overlapping chatter]

33:22.268 --> 33:24.236
Ms. Miller, what are you--
[stammering] Cover yourself!

33:24.270 --> 33:26.272
- Your Honor!
- Bailiff!

33:26.305 --> 33:28.074
- We're adjourned for the day.

33:28.107 --> 33:29.675
- Screw you and your
son of a bitch client.

33:29.708 --> 33:34.780
My body is perfect.
I'm perfect.

33:46.425 --> 33:46.558
.

33:46.592 --> 33:47.326
- Knees up, come on!
Keep them up!

33:48.494 --> 33:49.528
- Barba and Benson
good with us

33:49.561 --> 33:52.464
talking to Jenna about this?
- I don't know. Yet.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.799
Just--just let me see
if I'm right first.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.267
- Come on!
Keep going, keep going.

33:55.301 --> 33:56.668
- Chad?
- Hey, can we talk to you?

33:56.702 --> 33:58.504
- No, we've had enough with
police and DAs.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.639
- We just need one minute.
- I need to practice.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.441
- It's 10:30.
- I'm energized.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.775
- Okay, Jenna.
- I can go all night.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.511
- Have you ever talked
to a psychiatrist

34:05.544 --> 34:07.479
about all of your behavior?
- No--I--

34:07.513 --> 34:08.347
You know what,
you guys--you gotta

34:08.380 --> 34:09.315
get out of here
right now, come on.

34:09.348 --> 34:10.082
- No, no, I'm sorry.
- No--the mood swings,

34:10.116 --> 34:12.084
sexually acting out,
all the anger,

34:12.118 --> 34:13.519
there could be a reason
for that.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.587
- You might need medication.
- What she needs

34:15.621 --> 34:16.855
is to train, all right?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.524
And focus.

34:18.557 --> 34:21.127
Listen, do you know I--just
back off a second all right?

34:21.160 --> 34:23.695
Listen to me. Do you know
how hard I've worked?

34:23.729 --> 34:25.697
- I know.
I know.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.667
Living with your behavior.
Your mood swings.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.403
Your wild nights in the city.
- [laughs]

34:31.437 --> 34:34.106
What are you--
what are you talking about?

34:34.140 --> 34:35.707
[laughing]

34:35.741 --> 34:37.143
What are you talking--
- You guys think I'm stupid

34:37.176 --> 34:38.410
that I didn't figure out
what was going on?

34:38.444 --> 34:40.512
Babe, listen.
You have some issues.

34:40.546 --> 34:43.615
But we can still win
a gold medal.

34:43.649 --> 34:46.852
I was protecting you, babe.
- [gasps]

34:50.589 --> 34:52.724
Wait.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.760
You all think I'm crazy.
both: No.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.129
- You have a mental illness.
- I--

34:57.163 --> 34:58.697
- Jenna.
- Oh, my God.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.832
- Listen, hey.
Hey--

35:00.866 --> 35:02.734
Let us--let us help you.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.836
- Get away from me.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.439
- Jenna...

35:07.473 --> 35:09.341
I really think
you should talk to a doctor.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.143
- Whatever.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.391
- Dr. Cohen, you are a licensed
and certified psychiatrist

35:25.424 --> 35:27.393
who examined Jenna Miller?
- That's right.

35:27.426 --> 35:28.727
I met Ms. Miller last week.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.896
- What was your diagnosis?

35:30.929 --> 35:33.732
- Jenna suffers from
bipolar disorder.

35:33.765 --> 35:37.503
It's a medical condition caused
by a neurochemical imbalance.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.905
It's a lifelong
incurable illness

35:39.938 --> 35:42.608
that can be treated
with medication.

35:42.641 --> 35:43.875
- Can you explain
the symptoms?

35:43.909 --> 35:46.478
- People suffering
from this disorder

35:46.512 --> 35:48.447
experience atypical
mood swings.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.749
There are manic phases
and depressed phases.

35:50.782 --> 35:54.186
- How is a professional athlete
with bipolar

35:54.220 --> 35:55.721
particularly affected?

35:55.754 --> 35:57.823
- An athlete like Jenna,

35:57.856 --> 36:02.561
uh, her culture, it lives in a
place where there's competition,

36:02.594 --> 36:05.697
and victory,
and she must win at all costs.

36:05.731 --> 36:08.634
- So if a female athlete
with bipolar disorder

36:08.667 --> 36:11.203
were testifying in court,
for example,

36:11.237 --> 36:13.972
might she feel the need
to win an exchange

36:14.005 --> 36:16.408
with a defense lawyer?
- Objection.

36:16.442 --> 36:17.909
- Overruled.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.546
- If she was
experiencing mania,

36:20.579 --> 36:22.514
she would not take no
for an answer.

36:22.548 --> 36:24.650
She would do what was ever
in her power

36:24.683 --> 36:26.885
to prove she was right.
- Like, say,

36:26.918 --> 36:28.654
taking off her shirt
to prove

36:28.687 --> 36:30.422
that she had
a beautiful body?

36:30.456 --> 36:33.459
- Yes, absolutely.
- Thank you.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.797
- If a person is manic,
they act impulsively,

36:38.830 --> 36:41.833
have feelings of
invincibility.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.603
Isn't it possible that someone
in this manic state of mind

36:44.636 --> 36:46.738
might distort the truth,

36:46.772 --> 36:49.441
especially if the truth
were incompatible

36:49.475 --> 36:52.544
with her feelings of
irrational grandiosity?

36:52.578 --> 36:55.547
- Yes, very possible.

36:55.581 --> 36:59.885
- So if someone were having sex,
hoping to be admired,

36:59.918 --> 37:01.953
but instead felt rejected,

37:01.987 --> 37:04.656
wouldn't it be possible
that this person

37:04.690 --> 37:06.525
might invent
a rape allegation

37:06.558 --> 37:08.827
to keep her
manic state alive and well?

37:08.860 --> 37:11.963
- It's possible,
but unlikely.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.865
In my opinion, this person
would be more likely

37:13.899 --> 37:17.969
to justify non-consensual sex
as consensual than vice versa,

37:18.003 --> 37:20.706
because that might make
them feel better,

37:20.739 --> 37:22.674
more potent,
more powerful.

37:22.708 --> 37:26.578
- Nothing further.

37:26.612 --> 37:28.580
- Your Honor, I'd like to
call Jenna Miller to the stand

37:28.614 --> 37:29.948
once again,
now that she's medicated.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.551
- Uh, the jury has already
heard her side.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.552
- Yes, but she deserves
the opportunity

37:33.585 --> 37:36.054
to testify in a clear
and healthy state of mind.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.024
- First thing tomorrow.
We're adjourned for the day.

37:39.057 --> 37:42.294
[gavel bangs]

37:47.065 --> 37:49.301
- Turns out,
Wheeler's lawyer got nervous

37:49.335 --> 37:51.337
about Jenna taking the stand.
- They wanna plea.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.004
- Assault Two.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.574
He won't go on the registry,
but it's a "D" Felony.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.876
He'll get two to five years.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.711
- So that means this is over?

37:59.745 --> 38:00.912
- Yes.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.715
If we take it to a jury,
he could be acquitted.

38:06.718 --> 38:10.021
- Oh.

38:10.055 --> 38:14.092
- We need to get on
with our lives.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.561
- I agree.

38:15.594 --> 38:19.965
- Good.
I'll make the deal.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.700
- This is
the right decision.

38:21.733 --> 38:25.971
- Yeah, I, uh--I know.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.742
Thank you.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.811
I'm on meds.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.847
I'm starting therapy.
So--

38:35.881 --> 38:37.816
It's a long road.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.851
- What about Tokyo?

38:39.885 --> 38:43.789
- I'm putting that
aside for now.

38:43.822 --> 38:46.392
- I know it's gonna be hard,
but we'll do it.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.960
- [sighs] I've gotta work on
getting better at life.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.062
You know, not just sports.

38:56.067 --> 39:00.005
I started pole vaulting,
I realize now,

39:00.038 --> 39:03.074
to try and quiet
the voices in my head.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.811
Then there was
the acting out, I mean,

39:05.844 --> 39:09.615
the drinking,
the acting out sexually.

39:09.648 --> 39:14.820
Just taking risk after risk.
But now that I know the truth--

39:14.853 --> 39:16.021
- You did right
by her, Rollins.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.989
- Yeah.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.927
- At least now she knows why
she's so up and down.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.096
- Hey, next time,
will you ask me

39:25.130 --> 39:27.833
before you talk to a victim
about her testimony?

39:27.866 --> 39:30.602
- Copy that.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.444
Hello.

39:38.477 --> 39:40.812
Hi, baby!

39:40.846 --> 39:43.014
Hi!

39:43.048 --> 39:44.983
Where is everybody?
Huh?

39:45.016 --> 39:47.118
Kim?
- I'm in here.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.921
- Oh.
Wh--where's the sitter?

39:49.955 --> 39:51.990
- Her boyfriend
got in a car accident,

39:52.023 --> 39:53.692
so I told her
it was okay to go.

39:53.725 --> 39:58.096
- Why didn't you call me?
Why didn't she call me?

39:58.129 --> 39:59.865
Hey!

39:59.898 --> 40:01.467
What? What is this?

40:01.500 --> 40:03.134
What are you taking?
- I have a headache.

40:03.168 --> 40:05.136
It's aspirin.
- What are you on?

40:05.170 --> 40:07.473
Are you on stuff?
Huh?

40:07.506 --> 40:09.641
What are you on, Kim?
I don't even--

40:09.675 --> 40:10.709
What is this?
You're on Oxy?

40:10.742 --> 40:11.943
What, Adderall?
What are you on?

40:11.977 --> 40:13.645
What is this?
- It's lithium.

40:13.679 --> 40:15.447
- What are--
you're getting high off lithium?

40:15.481 --> 40:18.684
- It's prescribed.
Read the label, it's a--

40:18.717 --> 40:20.452
it's a legal prescription.

40:20.486 --> 40:24.189
- [stammers]
- Lithium and Asenapine.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.725
For bipolar disorder.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.960
- Oh, come on.
What?

40:28.994 --> 40:31.029
- Lorenzo, my lawyer, he--

40:31.062 --> 40:32.498
he was trying
to get me a deal,

40:32.531 --> 40:34.132
you know,
mitigating circumstances.

40:34.165 --> 40:38.103
And I was examined
by a psychiatrist.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.071
I thought it was
just a legal thing.

40:40.105 --> 40:44.009
But he told me that
I had all the symptoms.

40:46.211 --> 40:49.114
That I was bipolar.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.783
I mean, it makes sense,
you know?

40:51.817 --> 40:55.887
All the highs and the lows,
and--

40:55.921 --> 40:59.925
I mean, I've been on meds
for a year.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.260
And sure, there's--
there's downfalls.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.263
Sometimes I miss
the manic energy.

41:05.296 --> 41:08.700
But for the first time
in my life,

41:08.734 --> 41:14.039
I--I feel really good
about myself.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.941
- [stammers, sighs]

41:15.974 --> 41:18.476
You didn't tell me.

41:20.111 --> 41:23.849
- You didn't ask, Amanda.

41:23.882 --> 41:27.218
- [sighs]
