02:27.522 --> 02:31.608
Shush, please,
please, everybody quiet.

02:34.740 --> 02:37.129
Hey, Mom, how you doing?

02:37.130 --> 02:39.099
Ever since Dad passed away,

02:39.100 --> 02:41.550
you've raised us both like
a mother and a father.

02:42.510 --> 02:45.299
In honor of your birthday,
I made a small home video

02:45.300 --> 02:48.259
of the recording you made
of Elenie and I growing up.

02:48.260 --> 02:52.929
And Mom, you don't look a
day older than 55 years old.

02:52.930 --> 02:53.844
Love you, Mom.

05:36.960 --> 05:37.991
Mom, what are you trying to say,

05:37.992 --> 05:40.718
a woman can't be married
and have a career too?

05:40.719 --> 05:41.552
Is that what you're saying?

05:41.553 --> 05:44.519
What is the point of owning a house

05:44.520 --> 05:46.909
if you don't have anyone to live with?

05:46.910 --> 05:50.379
So, Mom, I'm gonna
marry a burger-loving,

05:50.380 --> 05:53.549
pale American man and
share my home with him.

05:53.550 --> 05:55.989
Hey, here we go again.

05:55.990 --> 05:57.889
Well, find me a
burger-loving Ethiopian man.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.639
Your father was a great man.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.729
They don't make men like that anymore.

06:30.655 --> 06:32.949
You are not going to
sleep with his accent.

06:32.950 --> 06:34.372
Oh, Mom.

07:06.650 --> 07:07.975
Abell, you're leaving?

07:07.976 --> 07:09.317
Honey, honey!

07:14.859 --> 07:15.692
Feel like I'm drowning here.

07:15.693 --> 07:17.209
Nah, you're not drowning,

07:17.210 --> 07:18.799
just got a little water-logged.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.269
Hey, talking about my weight?

07:20.270 --> 07:23.178
No, I know I'm fat, but you
can't do that.

07:27.767 --> 07:29.033
All right, sweetheart.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.599
Lena, if you were married,

07:56.600 --> 07:58.539
there would be more pleasurable way

07:58.540 --> 08:00.062
to work out a sweat.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.636
Mom, that is so disgusting, you know?

08:01.637 --> 08:02.979
And could you please knock the door

08:02.980 --> 08:04.763
when you come to my room next time?

08:07.333 --> 08:09.785
There are no boundaries in this household.

08:09.786 --> 08:11.951
Elenie,

08:11.952 --> 08:12.850
Elenie!

08:12.851 --> 08:15.229
No, not Yohance.
Kiss me!

08:15.230 --> 08:16.683
Mom, I grew up with him!

08:18.620 --> 08:21.039
He's like my brother, and
he saw me pee in my pants

08:21.040 --> 08:22.463
when I was five, no.

08:23.586 --> 08:26.663
You know, he works with his hand.

08:27.900 --> 08:28.830
He's a surgeon.

08:28.831 --> 08:32.513
Oh, no, yuck, that is not right, no!

08:40.679 --> 08:43.299
You should date him
'cause you're single.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.533
I'm gonna arrange it, it's settled.

09:01.846 --> 09:03.103
Elenie Tariku.

09:03.104 --> 09:05.009
Hi, Mrs. Tariku.

09:05.010 --> 09:08.354
This is Officer Freedman with the NYPD.

10:34.829 --> 10:35.746
You know,

10:36.753 --> 10:37.670
it's funny.

10:39.117 --> 10:41.449
When Abell and I were in college,

10:41.450 --> 10:43.400
he used to irritate the hell out of me,

10:45.120 --> 10:47.589
'cause it seemed like
he had this fascination

10:47.590 --> 10:50.879
with hammering nails in
the most random places

10:50.880 --> 10:52.649
to hang his pants.

10:52.650 --> 10:55.059
So of course, I'd wake up and hit my head

10:55.060 --> 10:56.623
on those things every morning.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.619
When he moved out, he took
all his nails with him.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.259
This morning, I woke up having the urge

11:04.260 --> 11:06.633
to start filling all the
holes back with nails.

11:08.980 --> 11:12.659
Then I realized I wouldn't
have anyone to blame

11:12.660 --> 11:13.893
for my clumsiness.

11:15.810 --> 11:16.643
Your brother,

11:18.230 --> 11:20.623
he didn't mind taking the blame
for other people's faults.

11:25.972 --> 11:28.805
If you ever need someone, call me.

11:31.654 --> 11:32.853
Thank you, Yohance.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.889
Charley, you hit Madison pretty hard.

14:07.890 --> 14:10.619
She had to go and see a
doctor, she was hurt by you.

14:10.620 --> 14:11.739
I should apologize for him,

14:11.740 --> 14:14.519
but I've never been
very good at apologies.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.399
I'm the dad, I'm Logan.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.439
Think your mom let me in.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.109
Oh, yeah, sorry about that,

14:19.110 --> 14:20.579
my mother is helping me out today.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.162
Come on in, I'm Elenie Tariku.

14:22.163 --> 14:23.329
Hey, Logan Thompson.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.879
Nice to meet you.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.179
Charley, I need to speak
to your father privately.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.839
Do you mind waiting in the hallway?

14:28.840 --> 14:30.689
He's gonna tell me what you say anyways.

14:30.690 --> 14:32.940
Wipe that tone of
voice off your face, bud.

14:34.160 --> 14:35.010
Come on, come on.

14:42.413 --> 14:43.620
I don't know what's been going on with him

14:43.621 --> 14:44.880
these last few months.

14:44.881 --> 14:45.812
Oh, he'll be fine.

14:45.813 --> 14:48.869
You know, when kids move to a
new school, a new environment,

14:48.870 --> 14:50.369
they tend to act out.

14:50.370 --> 14:51.589
My wife and I are from here.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.349
We actually went to the same
school, good old Larsen Hill,

14:54.350 --> 14:56.089
except I was the one beatin' up on kids.

14:56.090 --> 14:58.169
So where did you move from?

14:58.170 --> 14:59.080
Troy, Michigan.

14:59.081 --> 15:01.730
My wife got this great job
opportunity at,

15:03.080 --> 15:06.123
and I got laid off.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.389
Mr. Thompson, it is your
right to refuse counseling,

15:14.390 --> 15:16.729
but considering this is
Charley's second outburst,

15:16.730 --> 15:18.586
if he continues this way,
the school will expel him.

15:18.587 --> 15:20.233
You can call me Logan.

15:21.980 --> 15:23.380
Your eyes are so expressive.

15:25.070 --> 15:27.189
It's because they're
big, isn't it?

15:27.190 --> 15:28.390
No, they're beautiful.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.939
Isn't it funny the things
you were teased for as a child,

15:33.940 --> 15:37.193
you always get complimented
on as an adult, right?

15:38.190 --> 15:39.100
Where are you from?

15:39.101 --> 15:40.689
I mean, if you don't mind me asking.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.089
I'm from Ethiopia, do
you know where that is?

15:43.090 --> 15:44.490
Of course you do, I'm sorry.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.359
If I'm not mistaken, it's
the birthplace of coffee?

15:48.360 --> 15:49.769
Wow, I'm impressed.

15:49.770 --> 15:51.789
You know, most people would
jump straight to the famine

15:51.790 --> 15:53.169
we had back in the '80s.

15:53.170 --> 15:54.779
I got some good jokes.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.310
No, I'm totally...

15:58.340 --> 15:59.890
I'm kidding, that's ridiculous.

16:03.590 --> 16:08.069
Anyways, I recommend Charley
and I meet twice a week.

16:08.070 --> 16:10.299
Doctor knows best.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.800
I'm not a doctor,
I'm just a counselor.

16:20.340 --> 16:23.006
Six seconds, you ready for this?

16:23.007 --> 16:25.329
He dribbles, he dribbles,

16:25.330 --> 16:27.889
six, five, dribbling really quietly

16:27.890 --> 16:29.719
because the neighbors are asleep.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.173
All right, oh, he's
makin' some fancy moves!

16:34.127 --> 16:34.960
All right.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.203
Two,

16:38.938 --> 16:39.771
one.

16:43.348 --> 16:45.931
Yes, and the crowd goes wild!

16:47.648 --> 16:48.481
Yes!

16:50.160 --> 16:51.780
So Kobe, how do you feel

16:54.160 --> 16:55.610
about talkin' to a counselor?

16:57.390 --> 16:58.373
It's whatever.

17:03.510 --> 17:05.203
So are we gonna talk about this?

17:06.619 --> 17:08.709
Well, I was looking forward

17:08.710 --> 17:10.229
to having a long conversation...

17:10.230 --> 17:11.380
Being serious, buddy.

17:17.780 --> 17:20.180
You know, you don't have
to tell her everything.

17:24.637 --> 17:28.128
You just want to be
careful, you know, for me,

17:28.130 --> 17:30.659
for you, for us.

17:30.660 --> 17:31.493
I know.

17:35.010 --> 17:35.843
Cool.

17:41.620 --> 17:42.731
Oh, I forgot something.

17:42.732 --> 17:43.565
What?

17:43.566 --> 17:45.026
This.
No!

17:45.027 --> 17:46.543
Put me down!

17:46.544 --> 17:48.211
No, no, put me down!

17:49.993 --> 17:50.842
He's a winner!

17:50.842 --> 17:51.675
No!

17:51.676 --> 17:53.008
He's a winner!

18:27.543 --> 18:29.143
Mila, Mila Thompson.

18:31.726 --> 18:33.139
Wally?

18:33.140 --> 18:34.483
What are you doing here?

18:35.330 --> 18:36.543
I transferred.

18:38.130 --> 18:39.280
Wally, I can't breathe.

18:40.150 --> 18:41.529
You moved back without calling me?

18:41.530 --> 18:44.629
I know, we just moved back last month.

18:44.630 --> 18:47.109
You look as good as the
day we graduated high school!

18:47.110 --> 18:49.873
Well, on that day, I
was six months pregnant.

18:52.100 --> 18:52.933
Wally,

18:54.370 --> 18:55.260
how are you?

18:55.261 --> 18:58.403
Oh, you know, I'm good, fine, perfect.

19:00.210 --> 19:03.519
Unemployed, per usual, and
always looking for a story.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.249
You know, I sent cover
letters and articles,

19:05.250 --> 19:07.069
but people must use it to wipe their ass

19:07.070 --> 19:09.169
'cause I don't get so much as a you suck.

19:09.170 --> 19:10.699
On top of which, Mom left,

19:10.700 --> 19:13.109
so now I'm raising my sister with Dad.

19:13.110 --> 19:13.943
Sorry.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.549
Oh, it's fine.

19:15.550 --> 19:16.893
Life is what it is.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.609
What are you doing here?

19:20.610 --> 19:23.603
Oh, I'm just visiting my sister, Maddie.

19:24.910 --> 19:26.336
Why?

19:26.337 --> 19:27.303
Oh, you know, the school
said Charley Thompson,

19:27.304 --> 19:29.489
and I just didn't put it together.

19:29.490 --> 19:31.723
Charley, my Charley?

19:32.730 --> 19:35.669
Yes, he was involved in
an altercation with Maddie,

19:35.670 --> 19:37.589
some schoolyard tantrum, you pick on me,

19:37.590 --> 19:39.239
I pick on you thing.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.709
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

19:40.710 --> 19:43.293
Doctor said she'll be okay,
she'll be out in no time.

19:44.590 --> 19:47.040
How have you been here a
month and not called me?

19:50.840 --> 19:52.293
My mom got really sick.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.123
And actually, she died.

19:59.660 --> 20:00.493
Geez.

20:02.090 --> 20:02.923
I'm sorry.

20:04.560 --> 20:05.393
It's fine.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.959
I haven't really been
talking to anyone about it.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.289
I don't know what to say, really.

20:12.290 --> 20:16.039
We moved back so Logan could fix her house

20:16.040 --> 20:17.283
before we sold it.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.273
He's still doing construction.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.183
Cool.

20:27.490 --> 20:28.323
It's hell.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.830
Wally, I wish I was back in high school.

20:41.080 --> 20:41.913
You're sweet.

20:44.090 --> 20:46.099
Logan, didn't tell me anything happened

20:46.100 --> 20:48.009
with Charley at school.

20:48.010 --> 20:49.219
Well, maybe he didn't know.

20:49.220 --> 20:50.403
Yeah, likely story.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.137
They cover for each other.

21:08.748 --> 21:12.529
Thank you, Lenie, but not tonight.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.269
Really?

22:11.624 --> 22:14.823
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop!

22:16.038 --> 22:18.146
Hey, honey, honey, it's okay.

22:18.147 --> 22:22.382
Baby boy, hey, it's okay,

22:22.383 --> 22:23.800
just a bad dream.

22:29.089 --> 22:30.756
Go brush your teeth.

22:32.668 --> 22:36.251
I don't want to brush my teeth.

22:38.115 --> 22:39.024
Goodnight!

22:39.025 --> 22:40.554
Goodnight.

22:59.221 --> 23:01.682
I said I'm doing it.

23:01.683 --> 23:02.516
What?

23:03.987 --> 23:05.237
What are you...

23:10.158 --> 23:11.408
Love you, babe.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.793
Shave if you're gonna do that.

23:48.648 --> 23:49.859
Were you planning on telling me

23:49.860 --> 23:52.010
about what happened
with Charley at school?

23:55.730 --> 23:58.083
I was waiting until you were relaxed,

23:59.790 --> 24:02.330
which is what I'm in here trying to do.

24:06.480 --> 24:10.103
Oh, Mrs. Thompson, you
have, quite possibly,

24:11.360 --> 24:12.410
the very best

24:15.740 --> 24:18.600
knees of anyone

24:19.870 --> 24:20.822
I've ever seen.

24:20.822 --> 24:21.655
Logan,

24:23.321 --> 24:25.733
you haven't put me in the
mood to come home to this.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.823
You're Charley's dad, it's a school night.

24:31.010 --> 24:33.317
What kind of rules are
you settin' for our son?

24:34.710 --> 24:36.878
Yeah, I'm not perfect,

24:36.879 --> 24:38.879
established that when I flunked algebra.

24:40.910 --> 24:45.049
And just to be exact,
it's been three weeks,

24:45.050 --> 24:47.363
four days, five hours.

24:48.774 --> 24:50.149
What?

24:50.150 --> 24:51.073
Since what?

24:53.253 --> 24:55.829
Since the sausage went in the biscuit.

24:55.830 --> 24:58.426
Charley was playing
with your phone again.

24:58.427 --> 24:59.260
Huh?

24:59.261 --> 25:02.119
I said Charley was playing
games on your phone again,

25:02.120 --> 25:03.803
and now, your phone is cracked.

25:07.350 --> 25:08.183
Oh.

25:11.839 --> 25:13.799
Since the ham went in the sandwich.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.149
Dammit, Logan, have you
fixed anything in this house?

25:17.150 --> 25:19.199
Yeah, you know what, I've
been painting the walls

25:19.200 --> 25:20.269
in every room.

25:20.270 --> 25:24.189
But if you want, why don't you
give me a prioritized list,

25:24.190 --> 25:26.909
you can sign off on it at
the end of every night.

25:26.910 --> 25:28.058
How does that sound?

25:49.450 --> 25:51.769
I wish you and me got married,

25:51.770 --> 25:55.679
'cause you and I know how to
have a civilized conversation

25:55.680 --> 25:59.339
without it ending in someone
saying something retarded.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.543
Well, you know, I'm still available.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.590
Get off the phone, you're
keeping your sister up.

26:06.955 --> 26:09.205
Slamming my door's helping!

26:09.206 --> 26:12.752
I have to move out,
I'm too old for this shit!

26:12.753 --> 26:15.959
I know, you're so pathetic.

26:15.960 --> 26:18.000
You should move in with us, but

26:20.270 --> 26:22.920
I actually don't think living
here can be any better.

26:24.280 --> 26:27.123
The school called about
Charley's behavior again today.

26:30.970 --> 26:32.989
Charley knows we've been fighting.

26:32.990 --> 26:34.563
I'm sorry, that sucks.

26:38.820 --> 26:41.893
Wally, I miss our moms.

26:46.295 --> 26:47.793
It's awful living here.

26:49.830 --> 26:51.053
Death is so shitty.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.503
I hear ya, death is lame.

27:29.108 --> 27:30.941
I got you some food.

27:36.450 --> 27:37.300
You've gotta eat.

27:38.360 --> 27:41.590
Remember, you like the
food from this place, Ma.

29:22.127 --> 29:24.813
You know, Emai, I lost him too.

29:26.090 --> 29:26.923
You know that?

29:29.910 --> 29:33.173
He was my best friend, my best friend.

29:39.934 --> 29:42.023
Now I feel like I'm losing you.

30:02.960 --> 30:06.253
Okay, okay, okay, listen, Emai,

30:08.409 --> 30:10.453
I made a big decision, okay?

30:12.490 --> 30:14.193
I'm going to let you set me up.

30:21.695 --> 30:24.659
But only on one condition.

30:24.660 --> 30:26.879
You have to take these black clothes off.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.843
No!
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

30:28.844 --> 30:29.969
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

30:29.970 --> 30:32.262
It doesn't mean you're losing him.

30:32.263 --> 30:33.613
These are just clothes, Ma!

30:35.863 --> 30:36.696
Come on.

30:37.690 --> 30:40.629
Believe me, Abell and
Pa would be more upset

30:40.630 --> 30:42.646
to see you wearing these
clothes than out of them.

30:42.647 --> 30:44.360
You have to do it for them.

30:46.010 --> 30:46.843
Okay?

30:55.096 --> 30:55.929
Fine.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.296
But this is our deal.

31:00.297 --> 31:01.714
Okay, our deal.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.449
Beyonce's tits.

31:12.450 --> 31:14.879
Excuse you, Charley, we're
not talking about Beyonce here,

31:14.880 --> 31:16.519
so you're gonna have to
think of something else

31:16.520 --> 31:18.143
besides a celebrity, okay?

31:20.710 --> 31:21.809
Your mom.

31:21.810 --> 31:24.037
Charley, you are out of
line, you need to apologize.

31:25.470 --> 31:26.619
Is he gonna be okay?

31:26.620 --> 31:28.409
Ask him yourself.

31:28.410 --> 31:30.049
You're the freakin' therapist!

31:30.050 --> 31:30.883
Charley!

31:45.389 --> 31:46.685
Hey, Lenie!

32:10.840 --> 32:14.898
How can I resist
this whimsical spirit?

33:20.591 --> 33:23.174
Hey, you want a ride?

33:26.375 --> 33:27.979
I guess so because I'm freezing.

33:27.980 --> 33:29.837
My feet are cold.

33:36.786 --> 33:39.703
Thank you.

33:41.962 --> 33:43.462
So, how's Charley?

33:46.980 --> 33:48.313
Unpredictable.

33:49.870 --> 33:51.020
No more notes, right?

33:51.980 --> 33:54.253
Yeah, so far, so good.

33:56.285 --> 33:57.879
Chocolate?

33:57.880 --> 33:58.713
I'm all right.

33:58.713 --> 33:59.546
You look really good.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.230
Women don't wear dresses anymore.

34:03.422 --> 34:06.063
I guess a dress makes you
feel like a lady, right?

34:08.949 --> 34:10.186
Totally.

34:13.532 --> 34:15.989
What if I dared you to wear jeans?

34:15.989 --> 34:18.659
Course I do, it's all I
used to do when I was a kid.

34:18.659 --> 34:20.168
I was a tomboy, you know?

34:20.170 --> 34:21.003
Really?
Yeah.

34:21.004 --> 34:23.609
I would have never ever guessed that.

34:23.610 --> 34:24.719
Yeah, I was.

34:24.719 --> 34:26.714
Like, tomboy like you
used to play sports?

34:26.715 --> 34:28.039
Of course.

34:28.040 --> 34:30.668
I was in every team you
can think of at school.

34:30.670 --> 34:32.223
You look so uncoordinated.

34:32.224 --> 34:33.222
Oh, my God!

34:40.260 --> 34:41.092
Turn left here.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.129
Why'd you point right, though?

34:44.130 --> 34:47.487
Oh, sorry, I'm dyslexic, you know?

34:47.489 --> 34:49.067
Oh, that makes sense.

34:53.306 --> 34:55.268
You know, I have the same
problem with my mom's ring

34:55.270 --> 34:57.270
that she gave me, it's a little too big.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.499
Yeah, I got mine when I was 17.

35:00.500 --> 35:04.259
Fingers were all ballooned up
from taking too many steroids.

35:04.260 --> 35:06.119
Wow, that sounds unhealthy to me.

35:06.120 --> 35:08.179
The marriage or the steroids?

35:08.180 --> 35:09.380
Why so young?

35:11.050 --> 35:13.708
You remember that
11-year-old in your office?

35:13.709 --> 35:16.379
He pretty much sealed the deal.

35:16.380 --> 35:19.193
I don't know, it's hard, but it's good.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.032
It's right over here.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.729
Really, you live right here?

35:24.730 --> 35:25.563
Yeah.

35:25.564 --> 35:27.429
That's crazy, I live
right around the corner.

35:27.430 --> 35:28.902
What a small world!

35:28.903 --> 35:30.103
I mean, it's Brooklyn.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.319
Nice digs.

35:36.320 --> 35:37.879
Thank you, but it's kinda too big

35:37.880 --> 35:38.886
for the two of us, you know?

35:38.887 --> 35:40.429
It's just the two of you?

35:40.430 --> 35:42.730
I just recently moved
back home with my mom.

36:00.140 --> 36:02.289
You've reached
Doctor Abell Tariku.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.855
I can't come to the phone right now.

36:03.856 --> 36:05.463
My God!
I'm so.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.378
Okay, try not to...

36:06.379 --> 36:09.279
Oh, grab this.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.209
Message, I'll get back
to you as soon as possible.

36:12.210 --> 36:15.569
If this message is urgent,
please press three to have...

36:15.570 --> 36:17.449
Stupid door never works.

36:17.450 --> 36:18.303
Well, all right.

36:21.928 --> 36:23.078
Bye.
Take it easy.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.731
Hi, Mom.

36:41.560 --> 36:42.823
Embarrassed, Mom?

36:43.680 --> 36:46.039
He made me feel so cheap!

36:46.040 --> 36:47.759
I know I made this
decision, but you know what?

36:47.760 --> 36:49.659
It's very hard for me.

36:49.660 --> 36:50.493
Enough.

36:56.748 --> 37:00.489
You have no idea how
hard it is for me, Mom.

37:00.490 --> 37:01.819
I know it's not easy for you,

37:01.820 --> 37:03.837
but it's not easy for me either!

38:12.331 --> 38:13.164
Hello?

38:14.736 --> 38:15.736
Who is it?

38:16.966 --> 38:17.799
Hello?

38:18.640 --> 38:20.286
Hello?

38:20.287 --> 38:21.704
Answer me, hello?

38:22.688 --> 38:24.829
Answer me, please, hello?

38:24.830 --> 38:27.080
Who is it, you know my son?

38:28.143 --> 38:29.143
Hello?

39:15.870 --> 39:16.703
How's school?

39:17.970 --> 39:18.803
Pretty good.

39:30.032 --> 39:30.865
Hey!

39:30.866 --> 39:33.059
Oh, what a surprise, look who's here!

39:33.060 --> 39:33.893
Hi.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.019
Oh, your mother was in this morning.

39:36.020 --> 39:37.719
She had breakfast with my wife.

39:37.720 --> 39:38.680
Yeah?

39:38.681 --> 39:40.049
Rama!
Yeah?

39:40.050 --> 39:41.003
Look who's here.

39:41.004 --> 39:42.141
Hey, Lenie!

40:01.640 --> 40:04.599
So, somebody's answering
your brother's phone?

40:04.600 --> 40:06.550
Someone picked up the phone?

40:07.660 --> 40:09.419
I've been wanting to cancel the account

40:09.420 --> 40:13.179
but I know Mom likes to call
and hear his voice, that's why.

40:13.180 --> 40:15.109
She must be hallucinating, huh?

40:15.110 --> 40:15.943
Stop it!

40:15.943 --> 40:16.877
It happens.

40:16.878 --> 40:18.044
Stop!

40:30.170 --> 40:31.909
Oh, hello!

40:31.910 --> 40:32.743
Hi.

40:33.648 --> 40:36.199
I'm Wallace, I'm Madison's brother.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.713
Oh, I'm Samara,

40:38.980 --> 40:40.387
Elenie's beautiful mother.

40:41.596 --> 40:43.191
Are you hungry, Mr. Wallace?

40:43.192 --> 40:44.275
Okay, cool.

40:52.740 --> 40:53.989
Ooh!

40:53.990 --> 40:56.079
Holiday is a great deal to me,

40:56.080 --> 40:58.199
and Christmas is a big
holiday in Ethiopia.

40:58.200 --> 40:59.913
Oh, it's a big deal here too.

41:01.090 --> 41:03.239
Your wife needs to feed you better.

41:03.240 --> 41:04.519
You are too skinny!

41:04.520 --> 41:05.999
Ah!

41:06.000 --> 41:10.739
Well, that would be tough
because she doesn't exist.

41:10.740 --> 41:11.573
Oh.

41:13.189 --> 41:14.443
My son is your age.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.993
Oh, does he live nearby?

41:20.000 --> 41:20.833
No.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.557
He died in a subway
accident six months ago.

41:27.010 --> 41:27.843
I'm sorry.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.459
That's awful.

41:30.460 --> 41:31.293
I'm...

41:34.262 --> 41:35.163
He was a doctor,

41:36.950 --> 41:38.763
Doctor Abell Tariku.

41:40.660 --> 41:42.063
They called him Doctor AT.

41:43.145 --> 41:45.153
That's good, Doctor AT.

41:46.910 --> 41:49.879
I called his cell phone
and somebody answered.

41:49.880 --> 41:50.763
That's random.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.310
His cell phone is still working?

41:54.190 --> 41:55.583
Somebody's using it.

41:58.340 --> 41:59.173
Oh!

41:59.174 --> 42:00.409
Are you all done, Madison?

42:00.410 --> 42:01.559
Yeah, let's go.
All right.

42:01.560 --> 42:02.709
Bye, Maddie, Merry Christmas.

42:02.710 --> 42:03.779
Bye.
Bye.

42:03.780 --> 42:04.613
Merry Christmas.

42:04.613 --> 42:05.560
Thank you.

42:06.496 --> 42:08.746
Got your stuff?

42:32.570 --> 42:34.349
How's the shrink?

42:34.350 --> 42:37.983
She showed me these
pictures, these splat things,

42:38.980 --> 42:40.647
Rasherzees?

42:41.481 --> 42:42.314
I don't know.

42:42.314 --> 42:43.257
Rorschach?

42:43.258 --> 42:45.123
Ah, yeah, well, they were stupid.

42:47.947 --> 42:49.099
Everything cool?

42:49.100 --> 42:49.933
Yup.

42:51.290 --> 42:52.840
You gotta get a new phone, man.

42:57.010 --> 42:57.843
Hey,

42:59.350 --> 43:00.859
if she asks you something, you know,

43:00.860 --> 43:02.819
anything that you don't
feel comfortable answering...

43:02.820 --> 43:06.809
Dad, I watch
CSI, I'm not stupid.

43:06.810 --> 43:09.389
Oh, smartass, huh?

43:09.390 --> 43:11.233
No, stop, come on, Dad!

43:12.330 --> 43:15.989
What we have here is
the rare South African donkey

43:15.990 --> 43:17.114
known as the smartass.
No, you're weird.

43:17.115 --> 43:17.948
You're weird.

43:17.949 --> 43:19.016
To be perfectly honest, you do look

43:19.017 --> 43:20.859
pretty stupid right now.
I am not stupid.

43:20.860 --> 43:22.652
No, you look super stupid.
You're stupid.

43:22.653 --> 43:23.486
No!

43:25.939 --> 43:27.349
Thank you for your call.

43:27.350 --> 43:30.632
Sorry we couldn't meet in my
office, is everything okay?

43:30.633 --> 43:33.223
I got this note from Charley's teacher.

43:34.290 --> 43:35.619
Oh, another note?

43:35.620 --> 43:37.229
She seems like
a really nice lady.

43:37.230 --> 43:38.837
What strike now?

43:41.016 --> 43:43.163
I don't know, I could
use some advice, I guess.

43:46.581 --> 43:48.229
So are you and your wife ready

43:48.230 --> 43:51.139
to start family therapy, or?

43:51.140 --> 43:54.501
I think his teacher's
overreacting, I mean, don't you?

43:54.502 --> 43:56.236
I mean, come on, Charley's not,

43:56.237 --> 43:57.619
you know, he's not a bad kid.

43:57.620 --> 43:59.629
Then you should give it some time.

43:59.630 --> 44:01.380
Time will tell, things will change.

44:05.500 --> 44:08.090
I just want him to be happy, you know?

44:08.091 --> 44:08.924
Sure.

44:13.781 --> 44:17.212
Are you all right?

44:17.213 --> 44:19.630
I'm just hungry.

44:19.631 --> 44:20.828
Me too.

44:20.829 --> 44:23.496
Oh, here comes our food, cool.

44:24.600 --> 44:25.433
Oh, wow!

44:26.700 --> 44:27.533
It's colorful.

44:29.589 --> 44:31.229
Enjoy.
Thanks.

44:31.230 --> 44:32.709
She forgot the forks.

44:32.710 --> 44:37.019
Oh, we don't have forks,
we use our hands.

44:37.020 --> 44:37.853
All right.

44:37.854 --> 44:39.663
So you're gonna
have to try something new.

44:39.664 --> 44:40.593
Okay.

44:41.770 --> 44:42.603
Sounds fun.

44:42.604 --> 44:44.899
This is what we call
Injera, it's like our bread.

44:44.900 --> 44:46.149
Injera.

44:46.150 --> 44:49.667
It's made with a tiny grain
that grows in Ethiopia only.

44:49.668 --> 44:51.093
It's called Teff.

44:52.930 --> 44:53.993
It's gluten-free.

44:57.269 --> 45:00.809
And then you just put it in your mouth.

45:00.810 --> 45:02.699
What's this, is this lentils?

45:02.700 --> 45:03.640
Mm-hmm.

45:03.641 --> 45:04.949
I'm learning more about this.

45:04.950 --> 45:07.372
No, it's okay.

45:07.373 --> 45:09.140
That is so good!

45:09.141 --> 45:09.974
You like it?

45:09.975 --> 45:11.485
Wow, that is amazing!

45:11.486 --> 45:12.653
Yeah?
Yeah!

45:54.421 --> 45:55.254
Hey.

45:57.390 --> 45:58.542
You know what I miss?

45:58.543 --> 45:59.376
What?

46:01.790 --> 46:03.790
Being your girlfriend.

46:06.834 --> 46:08.703
What do I have to do

46:08.704 --> 46:10.702
to get you to take me out on a hot date?

46:16.245 --> 46:17.141
Ask.

46:35.557 --> 46:36.390
I...

47:06.543 --> 47:10.640
Didn't he, like, light his
textbook on fire, or something?

47:10.641 --> 47:11.842
Logan, grow up.

47:11.843 --> 47:13.759
I'm just saying, you know,

47:13.760 --> 47:16.273
let's just not leave him
alone, let's stay home.

47:18.520 --> 47:19.933
Two hours of TV.

47:20.821 --> 47:22.119
Mom!
Thank you so much.

47:22.120 --> 47:22.963
Don't Mom me.

47:24.518 --> 47:26.526
Listen to me, you see
this guy right here?

47:26.527 --> 47:29.754
If you see him with a
book, I want you to go

47:29.755 --> 47:30.637
to the neighbor's house...
Neighbor.

47:33.407 --> 47:34.340
You look slamming, Mila.

47:34.341 --> 47:37.283
Oh, thank you for noticing.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.648
I noticed.
Yeah, sure you did.

47:40.649 --> 47:41.649
I noticed!

47:57.240 --> 47:59.169
Only let me have two.

47:59.170 --> 48:00.889
I've heard that before.

48:00.890 --> 48:01.723
What is that supposed to mean?

48:01.724 --> 48:04.831
It means you are your own boss, baby.

48:06.860 --> 48:07.693
Hey.

48:07.693 --> 48:08.526
Hi, how you doing?

48:08.527 --> 48:10.063
Great, how are you?

48:10.064 --> 48:12.449
Very well.

48:12.450 --> 48:14.849
Two tequila shots, please, chilled.

48:14.850 --> 48:15.751
Coming right up.

48:21.361 --> 48:22.300
Thank you.

48:30.486 --> 48:31.375
Come on.

48:51.410 --> 48:52.243
That's two.

48:53.639 --> 48:55.549
Hold that thought.

48:55.550 --> 48:56.717
I have to pee.

48:57.860 --> 49:01.129
Are you sure you're allowed
to have these before dinner?

49:01.130 --> 49:02.927
I won't tell if you won't tell.

49:07.850 --> 49:09.909
Did you do this crash drawing?

49:09.910 --> 49:10.743
Yeah.

49:11.720 --> 49:13.520
Sucks to be that subway.

49:17.628 --> 49:19.298
Hey.

49:31.733 --> 49:32.999
Oh, my God!

49:33.000 --> 49:34.569
Hey!
Logan

49:34.570 --> 49:35.889
Thompson, hey!

49:35.890 --> 49:38.459
Hi, buddy, this is my spot.

49:38.460 --> 49:39.293
Are you serious?

49:39.294 --> 49:40.779
I come here too all the time.

49:40.780 --> 49:41.949
Well, we live right around the corner.

49:41.950 --> 49:42.950
Brooklyn for you.

49:42.951 --> 49:45.100
Brooklyn!

49:45.101 --> 49:46.649
What are you doing here by yourself?

49:46.650 --> 49:47.620
No, I'm not by myself.

49:47.621 --> 49:49.161
My wife is in the bathroom.

49:49.162 --> 49:50.299
Oh, okay, okay.
Yeah.

49:50.300 --> 49:51.969
I'm here with my girlfriend as well.

49:51.970 --> 49:53.113
How's Charley again?

49:54.160 --> 49:55.810
Charley's good, Charley's good.

49:57.810 --> 49:59.894
So you know how to dance?
How's your mom?

49:59.895 --> 50:01.208
Good.

50:01.209 --> 50:02.639
I want to see you do some moves!

50:02.640 --> 50:03.530
I can do some moves.
Come on, show me.

50:03.531 --> 50:04.709
You want some of these moves?

50:04.710 --> 50:05.543
Yeah.

50:06.870 --> 50:08.477
Oh, wow, '80s, huh?

50:08.478 --> 50:11.599
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

50:11.600 --> 50:12.683
Don't let me dance.

50:14.575 --> 50:16.635
I don't know, I'm sorry.

50:16.636 --> 50:17.605
Mila!

50:17.605 --> 50:18.438
Mila, hey!

50:20.064 --> 50:20.897
This is my wife.

50:20.898 --> 50:22.202
Mila, this is Elenie.

50:22.203 --> 50:23.719
This is Charley's counselor.

50:23.720 --> 50:28.669
I'm really sorry that I
haven't been by to see you,

50:28.670 --> 50:31.369
but I started a new job at the hospital

50:31.370 --> 50:32.720
and it's just been so busy.

50:34.409 --> 50:35.576
I'm a bad mom.

50:35.577 --> 50:38.459
No, no.
That's not true.

50:38.460 --> 50:39.430
Okay, I need another drink.

50:39.431 --> 50:41.928
Oh, this is my friend, Ayana.

50:41.929 --> 50:42.762
Hi.
Hey.

50:42.762 --> 50:43.595
Mr. and Mrs. Thompson.

50:43.595 --> 50:44.428
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.

50:44.429 --> 50:45.849
I'm propping her up with my elbow.

50:45.850 --> 50:46.790
Oh, okay, would you like another drink?

50:46.791 --> 50:48.489
I do.
Yeah, okay, come on.

50:48.490 --> 50:49.862
I want another drink.

50:49.863 --> 50:51.589
What happened to two?

50:51.590 --> 50:55.599
Two happened to you.

50:55.600 --> 50:56.483
Be social.

50:57.710 --> 50:58.610
Wow, you...

50:58.611 --> 51:00.549
She's just being social.

51:00.550 --> 51:03.329
Maybe I should do that.

51:03.330 --> 51:04.200
Why not?

51:04.201 --> 51:05.699
I can let go a little bit,

51:05.700 --> 51:08.711
but it's kinda hard when you're
a psychologist, you know,

51:08.712 --> 51:09.734
or a counselor.

51:09.735 --> 51:11.299
I bet you could find a way.

51:11.300 --> 51:14.118
Sure, once in a while, but not always.

51:14.119 --> 51:14.952
What?

51:14.953 --> 51:16.244
Not always!

51:16.245 --> 51:18.909
Okay, this is my bad ear.

51:18.910 --> 51:20.238
Not always!

51:20.239 --> 51:23.279
Yeah, did you
make that dress yourself?

51:23.280 --> 51:24.954
No, I bought it.

51:24.955 --> 51:26.599
I don't know, I'm sorry.
Why?

51:26.600 --> 51:28.673
Do you think I make dresses
all the time or something?

51:28.674 --> 51:29.650
No, I just...
Just because I wear 'em?

51:29.651 --> 51:31.253
You just look talented.

51:32.140 --> 51:32.973
That's very nice of you.

51:32.974 --> 51:34.289
Oh, no worries.

51:34.290 --> 51:36.077
I'm ready to go right now!

51:37.284 --> 51:39.492
Kidding, both are for you.

51:39.493 --> 51:40.463
That's great.

51:41.480 --> 51:42.649
I'm gonna give you the better one.

51:42.650 --> 51:44.009
Okay, thank you.

51:44.010 --> 51:45.336
Cheers.
Cheers.

51:45.337 --> 51:46.686
Cheers.
Cheers.

51:46.687 --> 51:47.545
Cheers.
Cheers.

51:47.546 --> 51:48.969
Cheers.
Cheers.

51:48.970 --> 51:50.123
Cheers.
Oh, cheers!

51:51.510 --> 51:53.763
Cheers.

51:56.008 --> 51:58.209
You don't need it, come on.

51:58.210 --> 51:59.043
Baby, eh!

52:02.019 --> 52:03.439
What happened to two drinks?

52:07.620 --> 52:09.929
What happened to being my own boss?

52:12.899 --> 52:14.089
Right, no, come on!

52:14.090 --> 52:16.535
What are you doing, what are you doing?

52:16.536 --> 52:17.690
What are you doing?

52:23.536 --> 52:24.758
I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry.

52:24.759 --> 52:25.818
What are you sorry about?

52:25.819 --> 52:26.977
Come on, come on.
What?

52:26.978 --> 52:28.579
What happened to two drinks, huh?

52:28.580 --> 52:29.430
Don't touch me!

52:30.576 --> 52:32.622
I'm trying to have a good time.

52:32.623 --> 52:34.639
Every time I have a good
time, you shit on it!

52:34.640 --> 52:35.473
I shit on it?

52:35.474 --> 52:37.259
Look, I'm sorry.

52:37.260 --> 52:39.269
What are you fucking apologizing for?

52:39.270 --> 52:41.849
I haven't been out since
my mother died, Logan!

52:41.850 --> 52:44.030
Who are you apologizing to?

52:44.031 --> 52:45.048
Fuck you!

52:48.636 --> 52:49.469
Fuck it!

52:54.617 --> 52:56.039
I think the heat's broken!

52:56.040 --> 52:56.873
Yup!

52:58.692 --> 52:59.525
Oh, man.

53:05.840 --> 53:06.673
No way!

53:10.759 --> 53:11.592
Oh!

53:13.440 --> 53:14.930
The king.

53:19.835 --> 53:22.813
Oh, man!

53:22.814 --> 53:23.647
Oh, I miss this.

53:36.340 --> 53:37.173
Doctor AT.

53:38.485 --> 53:39.318
Shit.

53:54.490 --> 53:56.883
Hey, can I get my tab closed out?

53:59.370 --> 54:01.471
Hey, is everything okay?

54:06.381 --> 54:07.414
She left her purse.

54:20.694 --> 54:22.011
Thank you for walking me home.

54:22.012 --> 54:23.108
Are you gonna be okay?

54:27.781 --> 54:29.297
I always am.

54:29.298 --> 54:30.215
You sure?

54:32.501 --> 54:33.334
What?

55:13.936 --> 55:15.237
You should go.

55:15.238 --> 55:16.140
You're right.

55:16.141 --> 55:18.668
You're right, this is,

55:18.669 --> 55:20.473
this is a horrible idea.

55:20.474 --> 55:21.307
I just,

55:22.752 --> 55:24.921
you're right, I should go home.

55:50.915 --> 55:52.027
This is really good.

56:55.477 --> 56:56.927
I'm sorry about last night.

57:00.040 --> 57:01.753
I guess I'm a piece of work, huh?

57:14.520 --> 57:17.643
Hey, did you see my purse from last night?

57:23.220 --> 57:24.053
I love you.

57:35.150 --> 57:37.453
Charley, what are your
soldiers looking for?

57:39.400 --> 57:40.233
Hmm?

57:42.020 --> 57:43.820
Are they looking for something cool?

57:45.820 --> 57:48.620
Charley, I know you're sad
about your grandmother dying.

57:49.930 --> 57:51.783
Someone close to me passed away too.

57:53.700 --> 57:55.300
Would you like to see a picture?

58:03.590 --> 58:06.363
This is my brother,
Abell, he was a doctor.

58:10.540 --> 58:11.683
Charley, are you okay?

58:12.620 --> 58:15.259
Charley, you don't have
to look at this picture.

58:15.260 --> 58:17.500
We'll do something else,
we'll try something else.

58:19.152 --> 58:19.985
You okay?

58:22.203 --> 58:23.036
What?

58:24.350 --> 58:27.229
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

58:27.230 --> 58:28.063
The door was open.

58:28.064 --> 58:30.570
No, you didn't,
you didn't, I was just...

58:30.571 --> 58:32.154
Are you finished?

58:33.935 --> 58:35.189
Can I have a word with you, Elenie?

58:35.190 --> 58:37.529
Sure, of course.

58:37.530 --> 58:39.280
Charley, we'll be right back, okay?

58:40.620 --> 58:42.749
It's been really busy at
the hospital every night,

58:42.750 --> 58:46.763
and all of my spare time, I
just try to spend with Charley,

58:48.060 --> 58:49.919
and I'm just giving you excuses.

58:49.920 --> 58:52.239
You don't have to give me excuses.

58:52.240 --> 58:54.163
Logan wants what's best for Charley.

58:55.070 --> 58:58.106
I think that he wants to
be everything for him.

59:08.645 --> 59:11.379
What's wrong with my baby?

59:11.380 --> 59:14.469
He has anxiety
and suffers from depression.

59:14.470 --> 59:15.373
He's 11.

59:16.950 --> 59:18.463
He shows tendencies.

59:20.390 --> 59:22.039
I'm so bored, my brain hurts.

59:22.040 --> 59:24.584
I know, honey, one minute.

59:24.585 --> 59:25.418
Go.

59:25.419 --> 59:27.749
Listen, I'm really
sorry about last night.

59:27.750 --> 59:30.156
I guess Charley's not
the only one acting out.

59:30.157 --> 59:32.016
No, you were fine, absolutely fine.

59:32.017 --> 59:33.763
No, I wasn't fine.

59:35.088 --> 59:39.029
I was a nightmare, but
we all make mistakes, so.

59:39.030 --> 59:40.516
Okay, thank you.

59:51.025 --> 59:55.099
I know you're afraid of
marriage, it scares you.

59:55.100 --> 59:58.103
Okay, I'm gonna go home, I have cramps.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.500
Elenie, please sit down.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.806
Please, sit.

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:12.549
I don't want to own you or tame you.

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:15.203
I want to give you the
space to be who you are,

01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:18.990
but also give you a place to come home to.

01:00:24.677 --> 01:00:26.135
That was a good dinner, wasn't it?

01:00:26.136 --> 01:00:27.873
It was, it was lovely.

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.159
It was too expensive.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.066
Yes, it was.

01:00:38.648 --> 01:00:41.039
I had a really nice time tonight.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.304
Thank you.

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.780
You're most welcome.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.923
Johance has my approval,

01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:00.117
your dad's approval, and Abell's approval.

01:01:01.456 --> 01:01:02.289
Okay?

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:18.713
Yup?

01:01:18.714 --> 01:01:21.414
Hello, Mr. Thompson,
this is Elenie Tariku.

01:01:21.415 --> 01:01:23.419
Yeah, I know who you are.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.819
You don't need to be so formal.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.069
I'm actually
calling to let you know

01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:29.289
that I will no longer
be Charley's therapist,

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:32.452
so starting tomorrow, I will
be handing his case over.

01:01:32.453 --> 01:01:33.286
Oh.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:35.693
Okay.

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.349
All right, thank you very much.

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:39.183
All right.

01:02:01.530 --> 01:02:02.463
Where's Dad?

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.226
I don't know, honey.

01:02:18.954 --> 01:02:20.020
Ow!

01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:23.483
Mom?

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.200
Brush your teeth before bed, honey.

01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:06.992
Are you okay, Elenie?

01:03:06.993 --> 01:03:08.685
Are you okay, Elenie?

01:03:08.686 --> 01:03:10.436
Are you okay, Elenie?

01:03:22.443 --> 01:03:23.409
You hungry?

01:05:44.343 --> 01:05:45.760
Mommy.

01:05:57.423 --> 01:05:59.340
I'm fasting.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.929
Mom, you better close your virgin eyes!

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:25.763
What?

01:06:25.764 --> 01:06:27.686
Your boy was not so innocent after all.

01:06:27.687 --> 01:06:29.623
He had a nudie magazine!

01:06:33.198 --> 01:06:34.498
Look at all these boobs!

01:06:35.369 --> 01:06:36.669
I wish my boobs were like that.

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:38.030
Oh, see?

01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:54.143
Mom, I'm gonna marry him.

01:06:57.095 --> 01:06:58.638
Marry who?

01:06:58.639 --> 01:06:59.472
Who do you mean who?

01:06:59.473 --> 01:07:00.743
Johance, of course.

01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:03.514
Really?

01:07:03.515 --> 01:07:05.044
Yes!

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:11.299
My only daughter is going
to get married to a good man

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:13.345
who loves her right.

01:07:13.346 --> 01:07:17.262
Okay, okay, okay, okay, do you know what?

01:07:17.263 --> 01:07:19.629
I have saved my wedding dress for you.

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:22.217
You're gonna wear that, yeah, yeah!

01:07:23.171 --> 01:07:24.832
Let me call, let me call him up

01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:26.631
and tell him that you said yes!

01:07:26.632 --> 01:07:29.733
No, no, no, Mom.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:07:29.734 --> 01:07:32.929
I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna
call him, I'm gonna call him!

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:36.872
Oh, God, no need for him to ask me, Mom,

01:07:36.873 --> 01:07:38.540
no need for romance.

01:08:03.428 --> 01:08:05.302
Goodnight, baby boy.

01:08:23.915 --> 01:08:25.082
Hi, Charley.

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:28.001
Can I get a hug?

01:08:31.506 --> 01:08:32.339
How are you?

01:09:18.139 --> 01:09:18.971
Hey.

01:09:18.971 --> 01:09:19.805
Hey.

01:09:20.916 --> 01:09:22.374
What happened?

01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:38.389
Mila, you home?

01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:39.759
In here.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.897
Man, traffic was bad,

01:10:42.898 --> 01:10:44.839
and Charley had to pee, so I
dangled him out of the window.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.383
You should have seen this woman.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:48.583
Hey.

01:10:51.225 --> 01:10:52.075
Where you been?

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.070
What's he doing here?

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:56.980
What do you know about someone

01:10:56.981 --> 01:10:58.467
named Abell Tariku?

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.669
Hey, bud, why don't
you go take a shower,

01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:13.450
wash up before dinner?

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:16.873
Cactus.

01:14:54.521 --> 01:14:57.854
Say something so I know it's not true.

01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:01.751
I didn't know what else to do.

01:15:01.752 --> 01:15:03.140
No, no!

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:08.413
No, no, Logan, no!

01:15:10.767 --> 01:15:12.211
No!

01:16:37.946 --> 01:16:40.113
I appreciate you coming.

01:16:44.287 --> 01:16:47.353
I understand that you don't
want to press charges.

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:51.803
I just want to say

01:16:56.003 --> 01:16:57.633
that I'm very sorry.

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:00.663
It was an accident.

01:17:13.974 --> 01:17:16.224
You are Charley's father?

01:17:26.787 --> 01:17:27.620
Lenie?

01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:31.184
Lenie.

01:17:32.625 --> 01:17:33.458
What?

01:17:41.644 --> 01:17:42.644
Oh, I see.

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:47.823
Oh, dear Jesus.

01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:01.403
I want to choose my words
carefully before I speak.

01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:07.593
If we don't say the words
out loud, it will harm us.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.560
I want to know what happened
before I decide how I feel.

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:42.709
Charley, when somebody
drops their phone,

01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:45.079
you give it back to 'em,
it's called not being rude.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.639
That's okay, he could
play with it, I don't mind.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:48.473
Say hi.

01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:50.059
Are you recording this?

01:18:50.060 --> 01:18:52.079
Yeah, you're in my movie now.

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.729
Say hi.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:54.759
I'm really sorry about him.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.397
That's all right.
I'm Logan.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:57.482
Abell, nice to meet you.

01:18:57.483 --> 01:18:58.569
Nice to meet you too.

01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.139
No, no, no, say
that to the camera.

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:01.619
Hi, I'm Abell.

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:02.763
Let's go!

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.099
I'm Dad.

01:19:13.697 --> 01:19:15.539
Dad?

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.904
Look behind you, there's, Dad!

01:19:19.716 --> 01:19:20.716
No, Dad, no!

01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:23.975
Dad, no!
Run, Charley!

01:19:23.976 --> 01:19:25.127
Oh, God!

01:19:25.128 --> 01:19:26.778
Charley, please get up.

01:19:40.733 --> 01:19:42.011
My God!
Run!

01:19:42.012 --> 01:19:42.845
Run!

01:19:43.771 --> 01:19:46.475
Oh, my God, no!

01:19:46.476 --> 01:19:47.756
What did you do?

01:19:47.757 --> 01:19:50.157
It was an accident,
Charley, run, run!

01:19:51.068 --> 01:19:51.963
Don't look back!

01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:59.763
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:20:01.810 --> 01:20:03.472
I didn't know that he was your brother,

01:20:03.473 --> 01:20:05.120
I swear.
Doesn't matter!

01:20:05.121 --> 01:20:06.332
Lenie...
No!

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:07.989
No!

01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:08.823
Stop, Ma.

01:20:12.254 --> 01:20:13.729
Please, I'm sorry.

01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:15.763
I didn't want them to take Charley away.

01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:18.540
I've been holdin' on to this.

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.203
It's killing me.

01:20:25.284 --> 01:20:27.070
It's destroying everything, my family...

01:20:27.071 --> 01:20:28.238
Your family?

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:31.393
You've destroyed my family!

01:20:32.650 --> 01:20:35.200
You don't deserve to look
at my mother in the face.

01:22:14.586 --> 01:22:18.025
Yes, I would like to
cancel a service, please.

01:22:43.889 --> 01:22:46.488
We'll find something nearby.

01:22:46.489 --> 01:22:47.906
What about Dad?

01:22:49.838 --> 01:22:51.338
He'll be nearby.

01:22:55.210 --> 01:22:56.043
Promise.

01:22:58.421 --> 01:22:59.254
Okay.

01:23:35.983 --> 01:23:38.400
Do you want some breakfast?

01:23:40.889 --> 01:23:41.722
No.

01:23:45.959 --> 01:23:49.292
I can't get another thing in my stomach.

01:24:06.497 --> 01:24:08.053
I'm so ashamed, Ma,

01:24:15.179 --> 01:24:19.179
and I'm disgusted in how
much I embarrassed you.

01:24:21.093 --> 01:24:21.926
I'm sorry,

01:24:24.858 --> 01:24:25.691
so sorry.

01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:30.363
I'm really sorry, I hate myself for it.

01:24:31.949 --> 01:24:33.503
Don't hate yourself.

01:24:37.170 --> 01:24:38.503
You don't embarrass me.

01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:42.053
You make me proud every day.

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.153
I'm the one that is sorry.

01:24:52.810 --> 01:24:54.110
You're stronger than me.

01:24:59.066 --> 01:25:01.316
I don't understand how
you could forgive him,

01:25:04.852 --> 01:25:06.183
or me, for that matter.

01:25:11.490 --> 01:25:13.597
When they killed your father,

01:25:15.006 --> 01:25:16.256
I was so angry.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:21.783
The rage burned me inside, and I let it.

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:27.283
For the last 25 years, it
prevented me from doing anything.

01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:31.863
All I had was you and Abell.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.403
And if you don't turn
out the way I planned,

01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:39.943
I told to myself, I'm a failure again.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.143
I don't know how to say it in English.

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.003
A whispering guilt, a voice
that keeps tugging at you.

01:25:58.410 --> 01:25:59.653
It haunted me.

01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:03.723
It's with me when I'm awake, when I sleep,

01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:06.633
all the time.

01:26:07.894 --> 01:26:10.277
You know what it says to me?

01:26:10.278 --> 01:26:11.516
No.

01:26:11.517 --> 01:26:13.433
You must be at peace.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:17.293
Find peace, choose peace.

01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:23.443
I have not been listening to
that voice for many years.

01:26:29.150 --> 01:26:31.993
I don't want to hold you
responsible for my joy.

01:26:42.178 --> 01:26:45.511
Like I did with your father, sweet love.

01:27:01.456 --> 01:27:05.259
I want to walk down the streets
wearing beautiful dresses

01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:09.163
and feeling attractive, the
way I felt with your dad.

01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:11.180
I'm serious.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.280
I'm serious!

01:27:22.824 --> 01:27:24.907
I hope you'll forgive me.
