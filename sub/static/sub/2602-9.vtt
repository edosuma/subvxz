WEBVTT

00:00.293 --> 00:02.088
Oh, this is amazing.

00:02.089 --> 00:03.322
This is so amazing.

00:03.323 --> 00:04.323
Everything about this
is amazing.

00:04.324 --> 00:05.324
What are you talking about?

00:05.325 --> 00:06.592
A virus got on the server

00:06.626 --> 00:08.125
and sent all of us an email

00:08.127 --> 00:09.126
with everyone's
search histories.

00:09.127 --> 00:10.327
Check this out.

00:10.328 --> 00:11.528
Sergeant Jeffords
searched the Internet

00:11.529 --> 00:13.463
for "undiscovered muscle."

00:13.497 --> 00:15.531
I was working out
and saw a muscle in my shoulder

00:15.532 --> 00:17.131
I'd never seen before.

00:17.132 --> 00:19.399
I thought it might've
been a scientific discovery.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.867
Listen to this.
Scully searched for

00:20.868 --> 00:23.636
"how much fudge
is in a calorie?"

00:23.670 --> 00:26.304
I never found the answer,
but it was a good question.

00:26.339 --> 00:28.139
Boyle looked up,
"how to make desk yogurt."

00:28.140 --> 00:31.341
Yes, I did, and I am thrilled
with the results.

00:31.342 --> 00:33.342
Although the jar
is really hot.

00:33.377 --> 00:35.377
That's gross.
And Amy searched for

00:35.412 --> 00:38.179
"Daniel Craig hands"
plus "close up."

00:38.180 --> 00:39.246
Ugh.

00:39.281 --> 00:40.514
You should talk.

00:40.515 --> 00:42.783
You searched for
"cheapest date possible."

00:42.784 --> 00:45.217
And I wear that search
like badge of honor.

00:45.218 --> 00:47.452
So, ready for dinner?

00:47.453 --> 00:49.841
Here we go.
[Grunts]

00:49.854 --> 00:51.321
Would you like
something sweet?

00:51.356 --> 00:53.223
Or maybe savory?

00:53.224 --> 00:55.258
Apple pie...
And I'm stuck.

00:55.259 --> 00:57.326
I'm stuck!

Peralta.

01:21.242 --> 01:25.210
Hey, Sal.
To what do I owe the honor?

01:25.211 --> 01:26.912
Oh, my God.

01:26.913 --> 01:28.914
Yeah, we'll be right there.

01:28.915 --> 01:30.848
Boyle...

01:33.584 --> 01:35.851
(Jake)
No!

01:35.852 --> 01:37.486
I can't believe Sal's
is gone.

01:37.487 --> 01:39.220
This place
is an institution.

01:39.255 --> 01:40.588
It's the best pizza
in the neighborhood.

01:40.589 --> 01:42.923
Well, eighth-best.

01:42.924 --> 01:44.390
But yeah, a tragedy.

01:44.391 --> 01:46.659
I mean, any food-related crime
is a tragedy.

01:46.660 --> 01:48.260
[Siren blares]

01:48.261 --> 01:51.261
Oh, no.
Heads up, fire marshal.

01:57.158 --> 02:00.812
Oh, Boone.
What's that nimrod doing here?

02:00.846 --> 02:02.446
Hey, Peralta.

02:02.480 --> 02:03.980
Hey, Boone.

02:03.981 --> 02:05.614
What are you doing here,
you nimrod?

02:05.649 --> 02:06.949
Uh, there was a fire.

02:06.950 --> 02:09.050
Big question is,
what are you doing here?

02:09.050 --> 02:11.885
What, did somebody call in
a missing doughnut?

02:11.886 --> 02:13.652
Uh, actually
someone reported

02:13.653 --> 02:14.920
they couldn't find
your head.

02:14.921 --> 02:16.655
But we found it.
It was up your butt.

02:16.689 --> 02:18.013
(Jake) You're a fireman,
you should know

02:18.023 --> 02:19.690
how to treat that burn.

02:19.691 --> 02:21.391
Joke's on you,
'cause this is a fire,

02:21.392 --> 02:23.626
which means it is
fire department jurisdiction.

02:23.627 --> 02:24.993
So why don't you back off

02:24.994 --> 02:26.794
and let New York's bravest
handle it?

02:26.829 --> 02:28.496
You know they only
call you that because

02:28.497 --> 02:30.264
"New York's best
at spraying stuff with water"

02:30.265 --> 02:31.265
is too wordy.

02:31.266 --> 02:32.399
Ha, well, it's too bad

02:32.400 --> 02:33.633
we all can't be as awesome

02:33.634 --> 02:35.334
as New York's finest,

02:35.335 --> 02:37.268
which by the way,
sounds like my mom

02:37.269 --> 02:39.636
describing her dishware,
which... and she's dead,

02:39.637 --> 02:41.471
so let's tread lightly
on the response.

02:41.472 --> 02:42.906
- That's not fair.
- Yeah.

02:42.907 --> 02:44.607
Well, look, we heard
this might be arson,

02:44.641 --> 02:46.008
so we wanted
to check it out.

02:46.042 --> 02:48.742
No, I'm not letting you
onto my crime scene.

02:48.743 --> 02:50.644
Okay?

02:50.645 --> 02:52.579
All right, fine.
You know what?

02:52.580 --> 02:54.966
You're not invited
to our next murder.

02:56.449 --> 02:58.615
Good solve on
the Herman Avenue burglaries.

02:58.616 --> 03:00.283
Finish up the paperwork
as soon as possible.

03:00.284 --> 03:01.717
Your wish is my command.

03:01.718 --> 03:03.952
No, that was
actually a command.

03:03.953 --> 03:06.287
So my command
is your command.

03:06.288 --> 03:09.389
Well, then I guess you still
have all three of your wishes.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.924
- You're not a genie.
- I know that.

03:10.925 --> 03:12.792
Okay.
We're leaving.

03:14.394 --> 03:15.861
What was the name
of the clerk we questioned

03:15.862 --> 03:17.072
about the second burglary?

03:17.095 --> 03:18.928
Where do farts go?

03:18.929 --> 03:20.996
I was reading
Scully's searches.

03:20.997 --> 03:22.465
Hey,
why'd you do a search

03:22.466 --> 03:24.433
for "magic-themed
singles night"?

03:24.434 --> 03:25.967
My last four dates
were really boring,

03:25.968 --> 03:27.749
so I thought
I'd mix things up.

03:29.771 --> 03:31.920
Oh, wow.
[Laughs]

03:31.940 --> 03:34.541
[Poof]

03:34.575 --> 03:35.742
Ta-da!

03:35.776 --> 03:37.476
Oh, no.

03:37.477 --> 03:38.677
What about you?

03:38.678 --> 03:39.877
Why were you looking
for real estate

03:39.878 --> 03:41.445
in Ropesburg, New Jersey?

03:41.446 --> 03:42.880
Ropesburg P.D.
Offered me a job

03:42.881 --> 03:44.515
as their new police Captain.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.516
I turned it down.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.517
Oh!

03:47.518 --> 03:49.686
You... Captain.
[Chuckles]

03:49.687 --> 03:52.488
Oh... that's super...

03:52.489 --> 03:54.689
Super cool.

04:02.695 --> 04:04.094
If we're gonna figure out
what happened at Sal's,

04:04.095 --> 04:05.629
we've gotta
get past those firemen.

04:05.630 --> 04:08.431
We need access.
How 'bout this?

04:08.432 --> 04:09.966
We light a bunch of fires
throughout Brooklyn,

04:09.967 --> 04:12.668
and when the firemen
go to "fight the fires,"

04:12.669 --> 04:14.936
we walk right into Sal's,
the crime scene's ours.

04:14.937 --> 04:17.370
Why do we want to start a turf
war with the fire department?

04:17.370 --> 04:18.971
I feel very uncomfortable
saying this to you,

04:19.005 --> 04:20.105
but it doesn't seem
like it's worth it...

04:20.106 --> 04:21.740
- Unless you think it is.
- I do.

04:21.741 --> 04:23.641
Like I said,
Sal's is an institution,

04:23.642 --> 04:25.375
and it's the best pizza
in the neighborhood.

04:25.376 --> 04:27.610
I'm sorry, Jake, Sal's
is only the eighth-best.

04:27.645 --> 04:30.680
I put out a weekly Brooklyn
pizza-ranking email blast.

04:30.681 --> 04:32.781
Sal's has
the fourth-best texture,

04:32.782 --> 04:34.883
ninth-best crust,
twelfth-best cheese,

04:34.884 --> 04:37.451
and honestly, they're only
seventh in mouth-feel.

04:37.486 --> 04:38.919
"Mouth-feel"?
What is that?

04:38.920 --> 04:40.453
The inside of your cheeks
are very sensitive.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.587
It's like the inside
of your thighs,

04:41.588 --> 04:42.587
except with a tongue.

04:42.589 --> 04:43.956
Ugh, God.

04:43.957 --> 04:45.824
Look, no, Sal's
has the secret sauce recipe

04:45.825 --> 04:47.871
that puts all the other
pizza places to shame.

04:47.892 --> 04:50.626
But more importantly,
fire marshal Boone

04:50.660 --> 04:52.828
is incapable of conducting
a crime investigation.

04:52.829 --> 04:54.763
All fire marshals
are doofuses,

04:54.764 --> 04:57.632
but Boone is King doofus
of doofus island.

04:57.666 --> 04:59.033
Gasoline?

04:59.034 --> 05:00.508
I'm pretty sure
that's water.

05:00.535 --> 05:02.468
Only one way to tell.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.404
There were more ways
to tell.

05:06.405 --> 05:09.072
And he's their leader.

05:09.073 --> 05:12.608
Captain, here's the mope
who hacked our computer system.

05:12.643 --> 05:15.410
His mother turned him in.
His name is Corey Park.

05:15.444 --> 05:16.611
My name is savant.

05:16.646 --> 05:18.780
His web handle is "savant."

05:18.781 --> 05:20.862
His people name
is Corey Park.

05:20.882 --> 05:23.082
Why'd you target us with
your computer virus, Corey?

05:23.083 --> 05:24.716
I don't know, I was bored,
and it was easy

05:24.717 --> 05:26.451
to break into
your weak-ass system.

05:26.452 --> 05:28.052
It was like taking candy
from a baby.

05:28.053 --> 05:31.654
Why are you giving candy
to a baby in the first place?

05:31.655 --> 05:34.823
Don't give candy to a baby!
They can't brush their teeth!

05:34.824 --> 05:38.559
Yes, sergeant, it is unwise
to give babies candy.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.860
If it's so easy
for this gentlemen

05:39.861 --> 05:41.594
to break into our system,
we may need to hire

05:41.595 --> 05:42.928
a new I.T. Director.

05:42.929 --> 05:44.970
Why don't you and Gina
get together on that?

05:44.997 --> 05:46.698
I doubt I'll need Gina's help.

05:46.699 --> 05:48.832
I'm sure she's busy anyway.

05:52.069 --> 05:53.836
Use Gina.
She's my assistant,

05:53.837 --> 05:56.171
and she has something
to offer.

05:56.172 --> 05:57.872
Trust me.

05:59.074 --> 06:01.008
Man, don't be hacking
into my stuff.

06:01.009 --> 06:03.655
(Charles)
Uh-oh, Jake, firemen.

06:03.677 --> 06:05.178
What are you two doing here?

06:05.179 --> 06:07.045
You're a Detective,
you detect it out.

06:07.046 --> 06:08.079
Good one, bro.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.614
- I know, bro.
- Yeah, bro.

06:09.648 --> 06:11.548
Wow, it's like watching
meet the press.

06:11.549 --> 06:12.749
Boone reconsidered.

06:12.783 --> 06:15.150
He wants you
to take a look at the files.

06:15.151 --> 06:17.552
Well, that's unexpected,
but...

06:17.553 --> 06:18.819
All right, fine, I'll...

06:18.820 --> 06:20.620
[Laughs]
It's not a file, bro.

06:20.655 --> 06:22.455
It's a doughnut,
because you're cops.

06:22.456 --> 06:23.422
You sure?

06:23.423 --> 06:24.757
[Laughs]

06:24.791 --> 06:25.957
All right, I don't care

06:25.958 --> 06:27.025
if it's not our jurisdiction,

06:27.026 --> 06:28.192
we're solving this.

06:28.193 --> 06:29.426
Would you like me
to, uh,

06:29.427 --> 06:30.660
file that for you, Jake?

06:30.661 --> 06:31.766
Just ask for the doughnut,
Scully?

06:31.795 --> 06:32.795
Can I have the doughnut,
please?

06:32.796 --> 06:33.929
Yes.

06:33.930 --> 06:34.996
Thanks.

06:34.997 --> 06:36.197
[Sighs]

06:40.087 --> 06:41.320
It's good to see you, Sal.

06:41.321 --> 06:42.888
I'm so sorry
about the fire.

06:42.889 --> 06:45.422
I can't believe it's gone,
Jakey, all of it.

06:45.423 --> 06:46.656
The pizza oven.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.657
The first dollar bill
I ever made.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.292
[Tearing up]
The 7-up fridge.

06:50.293 --> 06:52.827
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
You'll rebuild.

06:52.861 --> 06:54.962
The fire department's
been asking a lot of questions.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.864
Oh, fire department questions.
Let me guess.

06:56.865 --> 06:59.365
"Uh, what part of my face
do I put food in?"

06:59.366 --> 07:00.432
"How do you count to one?"

07:00.433 --> 07:01.967
"What's air?"
[Laughs]

07:02.001 --> 07:04.669
They think I torched
my own place.

07:04.670 --> 07:06.002
You know I wouldn't do
something like that, right?

07:06.003 --> 07:07.003
Yeah, of course.

07:07.004 --> 07:08.003
But can you think of anybody

07:08.004 --> 07:09.304
who might've done it?

07:09.305 --> 07:10.538
I could think
of ten pizzerias

07:10.539 --> 07:11.839
that want me
out of the game.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.407
That jerk Mario
comes to mind.

07:13.408 --> 07:15.375
We share a delivery radius.

07:15.376 --> 07:16.809
(Charles) Mario is number ten
overall in Brooklyn,

07:16.844 --> 07:18.477
and rising fast.

07:18.478 --> 07:19.645
He might've wanted
to move up the ladder.

07:19.646 --> 07:20.745
Of one foodie weirdo's

07:20.746 --> 07:22.513
personal pizza email blast?

07:22.514 --> 07:23.648
Yeah.

07:23.682 --> 07:25.382
Okay, we'll start with him,

07:25.383 --> 07:26.650
then we'll move on to the rest
of your competition,

07:26.651 --> 07:27.951
see if anything suspicious
turns up.

07:27.985 --> 07:29.619
It'll be
the perfect opportunity

07:29.620 --> 07:31.053
to update my rankings.

07:31.054 --> 07:32.487
Can we stop at home
for a pizza bib?

07:32.488 --> 07:33.888
No, Charles,
we gotta go fast.

07:33.889 --> 07:35.355
Right, right,
I'll just use my work bib.

07:35.356 --> 07:36.923
No, no bib.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.958
We're gonna solve this
for you, Sal.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.418
Sit tight.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.594
The guy who did the safe

07:42.595 --> 07:43.928
in the second apartment,
what was his name?

07:43.963 --> 07:45.529
Cone.

07:45.530 --> 07:48.051
"C" as in "Captain."
"O" as in "overlooked."

07:48.065 --> 07:50.053
- What?
- Nothing.

07:50.066 --> 07:52.066
She said "C" as in "Captain,"
"O" as in "over..."

07:52.067 --> 07:53.835
Yeah, I know
how to spell cone.

07:53.869 --> 07:55.436
Okay.

07:55.437 --> 07:58.905
So, Ropesburg P.D.

07:58.906 --> 08:00.840
- You know someone there?
- Nope.

08:00.841 --> 08:02.341
So you were looking
for a new job?

08:02.342 --> 08:04.476
- Nope.
- Weird.

08:04.477 --> 08:07.811
They just offered you Captain
without considering anyone else?

08:08.846 --> 08:10.480
Like Scully...

08:10.481 --> 08:11.881
Because he's got
so many years on the force.

08:11.915 --> 08:13.515
Hey, guys,
I think I put my gun

08:13.516 --> 08:15.717
in one of these boxes,
and I don't know which.

08:15.718 --> 08:17.819
You have a problem with me
that you want to talk about?

08:17.853 --> 08:22.388
Me? No, I am just
filing evidence, sir.

08:22.389 --> 08:25.524
Found my gun.
It was in my holster.

08:25.525 --> 08:26.825
My holster's on my butt.

08:26.859 --> 08:28.883
Good solve, Scully.

08:29.828 --> 08:31.561
Mario, this pie needs work.

08:31.562 --> 08:32.971
Good consistency
on the crust,

08:32.996 --> 08:35.797
but the cheese-to-sauce ratio
is a travesty.

08:35.798 --> 08:36.797
[Spits]

08:36.798 --> 08:38.599
Do you have to spit?

08:38.633 --> 08:39.866
In a word, yes.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.500
Amateurs go tasting,
they fill up,

08:41.501 --> 08:43.034
and they lose their palate
by the third slice.

08:43.034 --> 08:44.602
I take this very seriously.

08:44.603 --> 08:45.836
So, Mario...

08:45.871 --> 08:47.471
Let me tell you
what I think happened.

08:47.505 --> 08:49.772
Your credit card transactions
are down by 1/3

08:49.773 --> 08:51.107
in the last six months.

08:51.108 --> 08:52.508
Meanwhile, over at Sal's,

08:52.509 --> 08:53.876
it was a bunch of smiling faces

08:53.877 --> 08:54.909
and happy stomachs.

08:54.911 --> 08:56.378
One night, you snapped.

08:56.379 --> 08:58.948
A little gasoline... fah!
A little match.

08:58.949 --> 09:02.450
And poof! No more Sal's.
How right am I?

09:02.451 --> 09:04.551
The night of the fire,
I was at my father's funeral.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.886
Oh...
My condolences.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.019
[Spits]

09:08.020 --> 09:09.020
Ugh.

09:09.054 --> 09:10.488
(Charles)
Gino...

09:10.489 --> 09:12.790
This pizza is much better
than last time.

09:12.824 --> 09:14.090
You've always
ranked dead last

09:14.091 --> 09:16.058
in structural integrity
and sauce.

09:16.093 --> 09:18.993
But way more importantly,
I did a little research,

09:18.994 --> 09:22.096
and it turns out you did
six months in prison for a b&e.

09:22.097 --> 09:23.931
I did.
The night of the fire,

09:23.932 --> 09:25.933
I was at the prison
giving a motivational speech

09:25.934 --> 09:27.984
on how parolees
can turn their lives around.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.735
Well, it's good to hear
that the system works,

09:29.736 --> 09:32.003
and you are welcome.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.438
Have a good one.

09:34.472 --> 09:36.173
This is a dead end.

09:36.174 --> 09:37.707
We've gotta check out
that crime scene.

09:37.742 --> 09:39.475
Can't.
Firemen locked it down.

09:39.476 --> 09:41.076
Grab your spit bucket, Boyle.

09:41.077 --> 09:42.916
Those hose monkeys
can't stop us.

09:45.113 --> 09:47.447
Ah, you must be Simon Walker.

09:47.448 --> 09:49.182
Have a seat.

09:49.183 --> 09:51.184
It says here
you were an I.T. Specialist

09:51.185 --> 09:52.885
with the board of ed
for two years.

09:52.886 --> 09:55.094
Well, I know my way around
a computer, that's for sure.

09:55.121 --> 09:57.756
Query: What's your
favorite Jay-Z song?

09:57.790 --> 09:59.090
I'm sorry?

09:59.091 --> 10:00.424
Favorite Jay-Z song?

10:00.425 --> 10:01.892
[Chuckles]
She's kidding.

10:01.893 --> 10:03.593
Hmm. No, I'm not.
What is it?

10:03.594 --> 10:04.729
I don't know.

10:04.761 --> 10:06.996
- I'm sorry about her.
- Okay.

10:06.997 --> 10:09.025
What's your experience
with cyber-security?

10:09.033 --> 10:11.167
Uh, well, I added
encryption software...

10:11.168 --> 10:13.203
But seriously, what's
your favorite Jay-Z song?

10:13.204 --> 10:15.205
I don't know! Big pimpin'?
It's big pimpin'!

10:15.206 --> 10:18.407
Mm, wrong answer, friend.

10:18.441 --> 10:21.913
And that's, um,
how I got involved in,

10:21.944 --> 10:23.610
you know, systems analysis.

10:23.644 --> 10:26.178
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.

10:26.179 --> 10:28.113
There's no need
to be nervous.

10:28.114 --> 10:31.448
Yeah, we're all just calm,
cool, collected...

10:31.449 --> 10:33.049
- Wahh!
- [Screams]

10:33.084 --> 10:34.984
[Laughs]
Oops.

10:34.985 --> 10:37.687
Was that a little sudden?

10:37.721 --> 10:40.657
What would you say is your
biggest weakness as an employee?

10:40.658 --> 10:42.827
Um...

10:42.828 --> 10:44.811
I'm sorry,
what was the question again?

10:44.830 --> 10:47.164
He said, "what's
your biggest weakness

10:47.165 --> 10:48.666
[muffled]
As an employee?"

10:48.700 --> 10:49.774
That's just gross.

10:49.801 --> 10:50.800
I'm sorry,
I just have

10:50.801 --> 10:52.201
a skootch of gingivitis.

10:52.202 --> 10:54.670
So I'm trying
to treat that as best I can.

10:54.704 --> 10:55.838
Sorry.
You seem disgusted.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.573
Here's an itemized list

10:57.574 --> 10:59.608
of everything taken
from the garden apartment.

10:59.642 --> 11:01.710
TV, computer...

11:01.711 --> 11:03.045
"Ster-b-eo"?

11:03.046 --> 11:05.514
Uh-oh, spelling error.

11:05.515 --> 11:06.715
That's not very Captain-y.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.002
Oh, my God, enough.

11:09.019 --> 11:11.786
I just think that you meant
"stereo," not "ster-b-eo."

11:11.787 --> 11:14.154
Did you mean "ster-b-eo,"
Captain?

11:14.155 --> 11:16.926
That's it.
Get in my car, now.

11:16.957 --> 11:18.052
And if you say another word,

11:18.059 --> 11:20.527
I promise you,
you will regret it.

11:20.561 --> 11:22.963
Aye aye, cap...
Ow, okay.

11:22.964 --> 11:25.852
Fine, I regret it.
Ah... I'll go. I'm going.

11:25.866 --> 11:28.601
These firemen
are not moving.

11:28.635 --> 11:30.002
We gotta distract 'em.

11:30.003 --> 11:31.003
Tell 'em
your little boy's cat

11:31.004 --> 11:32.237
got stuck up in a tree.

11:32.238 --> 11:34.238
Ooh, undercover work.
I love it.

11:34.239 --> 11:35.639
I need more back story.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.707
First off, can it be
my daughter's cat?

11:37.741 --> 11:39.608
Okay, but if you get made
because of that, it's on you.

11:39.642 --> 11:41.543
Fine.
Let's talk about the cat.

11:41.544 --> 11:43.143
Short-hair, long-hair?
Tabby?

11:43.144 --> 11:44.811
Short-hair, calico.

11:44.846 --> 11:46.956
The son is adopted.
Your wife is in a coma.

11:46.980 --> 11:48.916
Oh, that's brutal.
I like it.

11:50.917 --> 11:54.650
Hey, guys?
Guys, I really need your help.

11:54.651 --> 11:56.883
My little boy,
Brian, my angel,

11:56.886 --> 11:58.286
I bought him
a short-haired calico

11:58.287 --> 12:00.970
after my wife fell into a coma...
Motorcycle crash.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.589
And now the cat's
stuck in a tree.

12:02.623 --> 12:03.890
(Charles)
He's a cute kid.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.157
Kinda looks like you.
Handsome guy.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.525
Handsome little guy.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.093
Oh, hey.
Just got locked out, so...

12:08.094 --> 12:09.894
He doesn't care.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.562
[Grunts]

12:11.563 --> 12:14.063
Brian was adopted,
so he has abandonment issues.

12:14.064 --> 12:15.735
Just struck out
at tee-ball last week.

12:15.765 --> 12:17.165
Everyone called him
"cryin' Brian."

12:19.901 --> 12:22.135
(Boone)
Hello, Peralta.

12:22.136 --> 12:23.270
Aah!

12:23.271 --> 12:24.538
You looking for something?

12:24.572 --> 12:25.638
What is the deal with you

12:25.639 --> 12:27.273
and this second-rate
pizza joint?

12:27.274 --> 12:29.041
This place
is a Brooklyn institution,

12:29.042 --> 12:30.675
and I'm here
because you think Sal did it

12:30.676 --> 12:31.675
and you're wrong!

12:31.677 --> 12:32.710
He did do it!

12:32.711 --> 12:34.177
Sal was in financial trouble,

12:34.178 --> 12:35.779
he has no alibi,

12:35.780 --> 12:39.634
and in cases of arson,
the owner always did it.

12:39.650 --> 12:40.917
What's going on, sir?

12:40.918 --> 12:42.219
What's going on
is that Peralta

12:42.220 --> 12:43.987
has screwed with me
for the last time,

12:43.988 --> 12:45.322
and now he's gonna pay.

12:45.323 --> 12:47.524
Oh, you know what, Boone?
Any time you want to...

12:47.559 --> 12:48.659
[Grunts]

12:48.660 --> 12:50.193
Well, that escalated fast.

12:50.194 --> 12:53.296
[Grunting]

12:53.297 --> 12:55.899
(Charles) They're getting nervous, Jake!
They're getting nervous!

12:55.900 --> 12:57.801
[Both grunting]

12:57.802 --> 13:00.570
Get off him, Boone!
You big marshmallow!

13:00.571 --> 13:02.839
Hey, break it up!
Now!

13:02.840 --> 13:04.741
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't tell my guys what to do!

13:04.775 --> 13:06.543
Don't tell me what
to tell people what to do!

13:06.577 --> 13:08.044
Well, make me not do it,
tough guy.

13:08.045 --> 13:09.346
Uh-oh.

13:09.347 --> 13:11.915
[All grunting]

13:11.916 --> 13:13.334
Hey, break it up!

13:16.113 --> 13:17.380
I apologize, marshal Boone,

13:17.381 --> 13:19.082
for Detective Peralta's
actions,

13:19.083 --> 13:21.017
something I find myself
doing quite frequently.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.552
In my defense,
I was the only one

13:22.553 --> 13:24.254
saying we
should stop hitting.

13:24.255 --> 13:26.255
Stop hitting them!

13:26.256 --> 13:28.091
Kicking them will hurt more!

13:29.894 --> 13:32.629
Okay, I'm a reasonable man,
so I'm just gonna say this.

13:32.630 --> 13:34.898
Fire Peralta immediately.

13:34.899 --> 13:36.199
He started a fight.

13:36.234 --> 13:37.634
He overstepped
his jurisdiction.

13:37.635 --> 13:39.527
And he's obsessed
with this pizza place.

13:39.537 --> 13:41.105
What I'm obsessed with
is how you're bungling

13:41.106 --> 13:42.373
this investigation.

13:42.374 --> 13:43.440
They should
write a song about it

13:43.441 --> 13:45.075
called welcome to the bungle.

13:45.110 --> 13:46.310
Seriously, why are you

13:46.344 --> 13:47.478
dragging Sal's pizza
through the mud?

13:47.479 --> 13:48.479
That place is special.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.147
Why's it special?

13:50.148 --> 13:51.448
Because it's the best pizza
in the neighborhood!

13:51.449 --> 13:52.650
Well...

13:52.651 --> 13:53.651
According to Charles's
email blast,

13:53.652 --> 13:54.652
it's actually number eight.

13:54.653 --> 13:55.920
Captain reads my blast.

13:55.921 --> 13:56.954
Of course,
it's the only one

13:56.955 --> 13:58.122
that measures mouth-feel.

13:58.123 --> 13:59.123
What, are you kidding
right now?

13:59.124 --> 14:00.157
This isn't about pizza.

14:00.158 --> 14:02.359
What's it actually about?

14:03.628 --> 14:05.295
When I was a kid,
I was shortstop

14:05.296 --> 14:06.429
on my little league team.

14:06.431 --> 14:07.998
Oh, my God.

14:07.999 --> 14:09.433
It's the truth.
It's not a brag.

14:09.434 --> 14:11.702
My dad was the coach,
and after every game,

14:11.703 --> 14:13.370
he would take the team
to Sal's.

14:13.405 --> 14:16.040
Halfway through our last season,
he left me and my mom,

14:16.041 --> 14:18.009
and the worst part about it
was that I couldn't

14:18.010 --> 14:20.011
go with him
to Sal's anymore.

14:20.012 --> 14:21.980
Well, that's certainly not

14:21.981 --> 14:23.414
what I expected this
to be about.

14:23.449 --> 14:27.018
[Crying]
Sorr... I'm sorry.

14:27.052 --> 14:28.953
I'm sorry
that happened to you.

14:28.954 --> 14:30.488
I mean,
what kind of dad just...

14:30.489 --> 14:33.331
Just leaves his son
like that?

14:33.359 --> 14:37.095
Look, you're...
You're a cop and...

14:37.096 --> 14:40.131
And I'm a firefighter,
but underneath all of it,

14:40.132 --> 14:44.035
we're just two boys
whose dads abandoned them.

14:44.036 --> 14:48.139
And you and I, we're gonna
solve this thing, together.

14:48.140 --> 14:49.140
- Okay?
- Okay.

14:49.141 --> 14:50.208
- Okay.
- Yeah.

14:50.242 --> 14:52.977
But first,
let's hug like men.

14:52.978 --> 14:54.979
Oh, boy.
This is happening.

14:54.980 --> 14:56.447
[Crying]

14:56.448 --> 14:59.517
Captain, get in here.

14:59.518 --> 15:01.652
There, there.

15:01.653 --> 15:04.455
There, there.
There.

15:04.456 --> 15:05.756
I'm coming in.

15:05.757 --> 15:08.391
[Groans]
Oh, Boyle.

15:08.426 --> 15:09.759
(Amy)
What's going on?

15:09.794 --> 15:11.328
Did you drive me out here
to kill me?

15:11.362 --> 15:12.629
I thought about it,

15:12.630 --> 15:14.130
but then I put
that thought on hold.

15:14.165 --> 15:15.632
I wanted to show you
Ropesburg.

15:15.633 --> 15:17.200
This is Ropesburg?

15:17.235 --> 15:18.668
You wanted this offer
so badly,

15:18.669 --> 15:21.538
I thought I'd give you
a chance at the job.

15:23.007 --> 15:25.074
Miss Diaz!
Are you here to reconsider?

15:25.109 --> 15:26.175
We've bought
the deputies bullets,

15:26.176 --> 15:27.175
like you suggested.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.277
Hi, sergeant.

15:28.278 --> 15:29.645
No, I'm still not interested.

15:29.646 --> 15:31.013
At all.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.314
But this
is Detective Santiago.

15:32.315 --> 15:34.016
She's one of
our top detectives,

15:34.017 --> 15:35.684
and she really wants the job.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.687
I...[Chuckles]
Yes.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.090
Can I ask what happened
to the last Captain?

15:41.091 --> 15:43.025
He quit to start
a carpet cleaning business,

15:43.026 --> 15:44.460
because that was better
than being Captain here

15:44.461 --> 15:47.096
because this is the most
boring place on earth.

15:47.097 --> 15:50.066
[Chuckles]
She doesn't mean that.

15:50.067 --> 15:51.567
It's okay.
It's true.

15:51.568 --> 15:53.160
Gotta be known
for something.

15:53.170 --> 15:54.370
[Chuckles nervously]

15:55.372 --> 15:56.672
So of all the candidates

15:56.673 --> 15:58.040
that you interviewed today,

15:58.041 --> 15:59.341
who do you think
I should hire?

15:59.376 --> 16:03.212
Well, the interviews
got a little off-track.

16:03.246 --> 16:05.382
But I'd go with Simon Walker.

16:05.416 --> 16:07.050
Computer science degree,
worked for the board of ed

16:07.051 --> 16:08.051
for ten years.

16:08.052 --> 16:09.219
That guy?
No way.

16:09.220 --> 16:10.754
He yelled at me
when I asked him

16:10.755 --> 16:13.223
the same question about Jay-Z
three times in a row.

16:13.257 --> 16:14.524
Why does that matter?

16:14.525 --> 16:16.326
Because whoever
takes this I.T. Job

16:16.327 --> 16:17.794
is gonna have
to deal with Hitchcock

16:17.795 --> 16:19.762
asking how to log in
to his email

16:19.763 --> 16:21.830
every single day
forever.

16:21.831 --> 16:23.666
How do you think
Professor short fuse

16:23.667 --> 16:24.692
is gonna handle that?

16:24.702 --> 16:26.436
Fine, what about this guy?

16:26.470 --> 16:29.339
Mm, no.
He was scared of everything.

16:29.340 --> 16:33.076
Do you remember Rosa's reaction
last time the printer jammed?

16:37.681 --> 16:39.682
I'll pay for that.

16:39.683 --> 16:42.384
Fine, what was with
the flossing?

16:42.419 --> 16:45.587
Mm, a precinct is a pretty
gross place, ter-bear.

16:45.588 --> 16:48.724
There's blood, wounds,
Scully's feet.

16:48.725 --> 16:50.292
You need a strong stomach,

16:50.293 --> 16:52.161
and that lady
did not have one.

16:52.195 --> 16:54.764
Plus, we already have
the perfect candidate already:

16:54.765 --> 16:56.232
Savant.

16:56.233 --> 16:57.725
That punk who hacked us?

16:57.735 --> 16:59.169
Precisely.

16:59.170 --> 17:02.139
Captain,
turn your greatest weakness

17:02.140 --> 17:03.473
into your greatest strength,

17:03.474 --> 17:06.142
like Paris Hilton
re: Her sex tape.

17:06.143 --> 17:07.108
Get to the point.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.412
Savant tore our walls down,

17:09.413 --> 17:11.446
but he can build them
back up,

17:11.448 --> 17:13.549
taller and thicker
than ever.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.701
But how can we be sure
he won't turn on us?

17:15.719 --> 17:17.319
His mom ratted him out,

17:17.320 --> 17:19.890
so I bet he'd love
a steady paycheck

17:19.891 --> 17:21.759
to get out of
that snitch's house.

17:21.760 --> 17:24.127
[Laughs]
If I had a mic right now,

17:24.128 --> 17:26.587
I'd drop it.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.799
There we have it.

17:31.369 --> 17:33.570
And here's the file
you wanted.

17:33.605 --> 17:37.174
Well, it's hard to believe
I'm gonna say this,

17:37.175 --> 17:39.410
because I've spent most
of my adult life hating you

17:39.411 --> 17:41.278
and everything
you stand for, but...

17:41.279 --> 17:42.479
Thanks.

17:42.514 --> 17:45.549
I'm not gonna lie,
my therapist

17:45.550 --> 17:47.151
is gonna be
very proud of me.

17:47.185 --> 17:48.519
That's weird.

17:48.520 --> 17:49.653
Any reason you can think of
one of your guys

17:49.654 --> 17:50.787
would've
forced this cabinet open

17:50.788 --> 17:51.788
while they
were putting the fire out?

17:51.789 --> 17:53.423
No, no.
I can't.

17:53.457 --> 17:56.560
Looks like it was jimmied open
with a crowbar.

17:56.561 --> 17:59.295
Oh, my God.
I know who did it.

17:59.296 --> 18:01.297
Come on, I'll explain it
on the way down.

18:01.332 --> 18:03.166
Wait, wait, wait.

18:03.167 --> 18:04.768
I can't believe
I'm offering this to a cop,

18:04.769 --> 18:06.703
but...

18:06.704 --> 18:08.205
Do you want
to take the pole down?

18:08.206 --> 18:09.797
Oh, my God, yes.

18:09.808 --> 18:12.710
Whee!

18:12.711 --> 18:14.578
Let justice be served.

18:14.579 --> 18:16.180
- Did you get it?
- Uh-huh. My turn?

18:16.181 --> 18:17.781
Nope. No time.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.520
Whoo!

18:26.304 --> 18:28.272
We know you burned down
Sal's, gino.

18:28.306 --> 18:30.474
You hated him because his pizza
was better than yours.

18:30.508 --> 18:32.142
That's not true.

18:32.143 --> 18:33.577
Gino's pizza's
always been the tastiest.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.912
Wrong.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.180
According to Boyle's
email blast,

18:36.181 --> 18:37.615
it was downright lousy before.

18:37.650 --> 18:38.717
That's what made it
so suspicious

18:38.718 --> 18:40.252
when he suddenly loved it.

18:40.253 --> 18:43.288
[Distorted]
Much better than last time.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.555
[Spits]

18:44.556 --> 18:45.856
The crust was charred,

18:45.857 --> 18:47.758
the cheese was stringy
and flavorless,

18:47.759 --> 18:48.926
but the sauce.

18:48.927 --> 18:51.395
Oh, Marone, the sauce.

18:51.396 --> 18:52.429
Continue.

18:52.430 --> 18:53.630
And that was your mistake.

18:53.631 --> 18:54.931
You didn't
just burn Sal's down,

18:54.932 --> 18:57.300
you also stole
his secret sauce recipe.

18:57.301 --> 18:59.169
Here's a picture

18:59.170 --> 19:01.271
of the cabinet in which
said recipe was held.

19:01.272 --> 19:02.683
Busted open with a crowbar.

19:02.707 --> 19:04.274
Look familiar?

19:04.275 --> 19:06.610
Also, your so-called
motivational speech

19:06.611 --> 19:08.646
down at the prison
ended at 5:00 P.M.,

19:08.647 --> 19:10.448
leaving you plenty of time
to get back to Sal's

19:10.449 --> 19:11.949
and burn it to the ground.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.552
So I guess there's only
one thing left to say.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.654
(Both) Gino Bianucci,
you're under arrest...

19:16.655 --> 19:18.223
- [Clears throat] Excuse me. No.
- Do you mind?

19:18.224 --> 19:19.824
This is my collar...
I think I can handle this.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.259
If I'm not wrong.

19:21.260 --> 19:23.261
Yeah, but I actually
did all the work.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.763
See, I knew you would...
You know what? Fine.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.431
Go ahead, I don't care.

19:26.432 --> 19:27.875
Gino Bianucci, you're
under arrest for arson. Yes!

19:27.900 --> 19:28.900
- Said it first.
- Real mature.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.202
Very mature.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.737
Off we go.

19:31.771 --> 19:35.507
So what'd you think
of Ropesburg?

19:35.508 --> 19:38.543
It's, uh... quaint.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.345
It's whack,
and you know it.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.481
Their number-one crime
is tricycle theft.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.249
There's a bakery
attached to the precinct.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.517
Come on, Santiago.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.286
You never would've
taken that job,

19:48.287 --> 19:50.255
so why'd you even care
that they offered it to me?

19:50.256 --> 19:52.991
I can't help it.
I'm competitive.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.294
I have seven brothers,
and I was the only girl.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.429
I always had to fight
for a place at the table.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.997
Well, you're not the only girl
at the table anymore.

19:59.998 --> 20:02.332
We work in a police force
full of dudes.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.853
We gotta have
each other's backs, okay?

20:05.502 --> 20:06.569
You saying you have my back?

20:06.603 --> 20:08.270
Yeah, I got your back.

20:08.271 --> 20:09.638
Don't smile.
I'm still mad at you.

20:09.673 --> 20:11.240
I thought we were
having a moment.

20:11.241 --> 20:12.708
Moment's over.
Shut up.

20:13.910 --> 20:14.922
(Hitchcock)
Hey, sarge.

20:14.945 --> 20:16.779
He made my computer smarter.

20:16.813 --> 20:18.781
All I have to do
is put my thumb on that thing,

20:18.782 --> 20:20.550
and it opens up
all my electric mails.

20:20.551 --> 20:23.920
[Laughs]
You seem real smart, man.

20:23.921 --> 20:26.256
Oh, and look,
and you play with toys.

20:26.257 --> 20:29.291
Savant, you're part
of the nine-nine now.

20:29.292 --> 20:30.559
We look after each other.

20:30.593 --> 20:31.627
Hey, ball,

20:31.661 --> 20:33.729
if savant
was to do anything

20:33.730 --> 20:36.569
to harm this precinct,
would I destroy him?

20:38.435 --> 20:41.571
Answer uncertain.
Try again.

20:43.241 --> 20:45.508
Peralta, fire marshal Boone
just called.

20:45.542 --> 20:47.510
He told me you should
check your drawer?

20:50.281 --> 20:52.916
Oh, look at that.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.318
I've been booned.

20:55.319 --> 20:56.586
Well, the joke's on him,

20:56.587 --> 20:58.001
because I was out
of shaving cream.

20:58.002 --> 21:01.058
I see we are once again at war
with the fire department.

21:01.059 --> 21:02.465
You are not to retaliate.

21:02.466 --> 21:03.986
Oh, I wouldn't dream
of it, sir.

21:03.987 --> 21:06.866
In fact, I'm gonna send over
a little peace offering:

21:06.867 --> 21:09.066
Some of Sal's famous sauce.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.066
Now, Boyle!

21:10.067 --> 21:11.365
[Alarm blares]

21:11.366 --> 21:13.445
Fire! Fire! Fire!

21:15.373 --> 21:17.199
Pleasure working
with you, Boone.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.639
Run, Charles!

21:18.640 --> 21:21.409
[Laughter]

21:21.410 --> 21:23.655
Come on... whoa!
Get that guy!
