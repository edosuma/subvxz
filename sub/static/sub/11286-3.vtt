00:08.164 --> 00:10.298
Oh, I wonder who they're from.

00:10.364 --> 00:13.198
Who do you know that likes you
and is that corny?

00:13.264 --> 00:17.031
Overton. Oh, but Overton never
likes to send flowers.

00:17.098 --> 00:20.831
He says, "Things should not die
so that our love may live."

00:20.898 --> 00:24.264
Still waters run deep.

00:24.331 --> 00:27.931
You know what? I know
it's not Bobby Dougan.

00:27.998 --> 00:31.598
We gonna hear
about Bobby Dougan.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.964
He was my sixth grade
secret admirer.

00:34.031 --> 00:36.931
He signed all of his notes
"Your secret admirer

00:36.998 --> 00:38.764
Bobby Dougan."

00:40.664 --> 00:43.698
It could be someone who works
at the dry cleaners, you know?

00:43.764 --> 00:46.231
Someone who likes
your silk teddies.

00:46.298 --> 00:48.298
Gives you unclaimed items.

00:48.364 --> 00:50.998
Romances you for two weeks
and then just..

00:51.064 --> 00:55.164
...up and leaves you
for some model/actress whatever.

Oh, cheer up, Regine.

Isn't it beautiful?

02:28.511 --> 02:29.844
Bad day, huh?

02:29.911 --> 02:33.078
Ugh. Bad would've been

02:36.578 --> 02:38.644
Okay. The brother was fine,
but he‐‐

But he kept checking himself out

02:42.811 --> 02:45.311
And‐and of course he had
a lot of money, but‐‐

02:45.378 --> 02:50.211
But he spent all night talking
about it to your cleavage.

if he has stamina?

from Mr. Guess Who?

03:40.284 --> 03:42.884
A beautiful box
of Swiss chocolates

03:42.951 --> 03:45.018
in a multi‐layered package.

03:45.084 --> 03:47.484
More like a chocolate condo

in every room. Yum. Yum.

03:52.018 --> 03:53.951
So, uh, who is this rascal

03:54.018 --> 03:56.784
who obviously has
excellent taste in women?

03:56.851 --> 04:00.824
Mmm. I'm thinking he's some
romantic and powerful diplomat

04:00.891 --> 04:04.324
who spotted me when I took
the tour of the U. N.

04:04.391 --> 04:07.258
‐ Oh. Really?
‐ Mm.

04:07.324 --> 04:09.658
Or maybe that handsome
movie director that Khadijah

04:09.724 --> 04:13.358
interviewed for the magazine
last week. Could be him.

04:13.424 --> 04:16.958
How nice for you.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.524
Maybe it is just some inmate
who saw your picture

04:19.591 --> 04:22.291
and is doing push‐ups
while chanting your name.

04:22.358 --> 04:23.458

with a mystery.'

I was wondering what you..

04:38.957 --> 04:41.824
She's on a scent.

Go girl. Sic him, sic him.

04:44.524 --> 04:46.724
[scoffs]
I can't believe you guys.

04:46.791 --> 04:48.524
You think I'd go after a man

04:48.591 --> 04:51.124
just because he has
a valid gold card.

04:51.191 --> 04:54.091
You could see that from here?

04:54.158 --> 04:58.258
Gregory Johnson.
Card member since 1987.

04:58.324 --> 05:01.331
Regine, bravo.

05:01.398 --> 05:03.664
Oh, why single out Regine?

05:03.731 --> 05:08.298
Many a woman's head has been
turned by a flashy trick or two.

05:08.364 --> 05:12.131
Some flowers, credit card,
American chocolates

05:12.198 --> 05:14.464
in a Swiss box.

05:16.031 --> 05:19.364
I sense he owns property.

05:19.431 --> 05:23.564
Regine's my kind of woman.
Completely transparent.

05:23.631 --> 05:26.664
I thought your kind of woman
was completely sedated.

05:29.264 --> 05:31.298
Max. Stop throwing
yourself at me.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.964
Stop it.

05:34.964 --> 05:38.031
Just take your ass over there.
You know you can't fight it.

05:38.098 --> 05:40.898
I can't believe you all think
so little of me.

05:40.964 --> 05:43.731
I too have a smidge
of self‐control.

05:49.031 --> 05:50.531
Ah, that is it.

05:50.598 --> 05:52.764
I'm, I'm gonna prove
you all wrong.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.171
Ginger ale, please.

06:06.571 --> 06:08.504
Keep the change. Huh.

06:15.704 --> 06:19.638
Give it up for Regine.
She paid for her own drink.

06:19.704 --> 06:20.971
Thank you.

06:41.604 --> 06:43.971
Overton, what are
you doing, man?

06:44.038 --> 06:46.904
Getting some air.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.904
The calf is going
with you, is she?

06:49.971 --> 06:52.838
Just getting rid of this gift
from Synclaire's secret admirer

06:52.904 --> 06:54.838
before she sees it.

06:54.904 --> 06:57.071
Look man, I understand
you're a little jealous.

06:57.138 --> 06:59.871
‐ But that's not right.
‐ No, no. You don't understand.

06:59.938 --> 07:01.678
‐ Mr. Guess Who?
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.'

07:01.744 --> 07:05.378
I am he. He is me.

07:05.444 --> 07:08.911
I was just trying to romance
her in my own special way.

07:08.978 --> 07:13.211
By sending her gifts
from some other man. Ooh.

07:13.278 --> 07:15.244
Clearly you revealed
a flaw in my plan.

07:15.311 --> 07:17.344
Mm‐hmm.

07:17.411 --> 07:19.711
I figured, look,
I give her a few gifts

07:19.778 --> 07:22.344
she would guess who and
show me a little appreciation.

07:22.411 --> 07:23.611
Know what I'm saying?

07:23.678 --> 07:26.178
But now she probably thinks
her secret admirer

07:26.244 --> 07:27.711
is some bigshot.

07:27.778 --> 07:30.278
She'll be disappointed
to find out it's just me.

07:30.344 --> 07:32.544
I know I am.

07:32.611 --> 07:35.511
Man, the way she fantasized
about this guy, I felt like

07:35.578 --> 07:37.478
I felt like Clark Kent
listening to

07:37.544 --> 07:41.378
Lois Lane talk
about Superman.

07:41.444 --> 07:44.278
But in Superman too Clark
revealed his true identity

07:44.344 --> 07:45.811
to Lois and they hooked up.

07:45.878 --> 07:47.378
Yeah, and while
that was happening

07:47.444 --> 07:50.744
the whole world
was destroyed.

07:50.811 --> 07:52.344
Man, I can't tell her now.

07:52.411 --> 07:56.211
If I do that, she'll just laugh
at me the same way you did.

07:56.278 --> 08:00.011
Overton, I'm not laughing
at you man, I'm just..

08:00.078 --> 08:02.784
...laughing
at the things you do.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.551
Oh, what a tangled web
I've weaved.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.584
Have weaved.

08:10.651 --> 08:11.751
Woven?

08:15.751 --> 08:17.018
(Overton and Kyle)
'Hey, Regine.'

08:22.118 --> 08:26.051
Don't you just hate it when
the Foodmart runs out of Advils.

08:27.418 --> 08:28.851
Argh!

08:28.918 --> 08:30.818
Oh, Regine, what's wrong?

08:30.884 --> 08:34.784
Everything.
I have no self‐control.

08:34.851 --> 08:37.018
After we all left the cafe

08:37.083 --> 08:40.851
I tracked down Mr. Gold Card
Gregory Johnson.

08:40.918 --> 08:42.551
How did you find him?

08:42.618 --> 08:45.218
Simple. Scent and Fabric.

08:47.018 --> 08:49.718
I identified his
citrus and sandalwood cologne

08:49.784 --> 08:52.018
and tracked it to Scott Henry's
custom perfumery.

08:52.084 --> 08:53.651
His suit, raw silk twill

08:53.718 --> 08:55.818
undoubtedly Julian of Paris,
the silk twill king.

08:55.884 --> 08:57.151
A quick cross reference

08:57.218 --> 09:00.691
I had his address
and his phone number.

09:00.758 --> 09:02.724
Ooh, you're good.

09:02.791 --> 09:06.891
Listen, I'm trying to track down
my cousins in California.

09:06.958 --> 09:10.691
I think they wear Brut.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.924
They're not
on my side of the family.

09:13.991 --> 09:16.224
Now, you know the brother
was fine, but he‐‐

09:16.291 --> 09:20.058
But he butter knife, to your
cleavage, blah, blah, blah.

09:21.758 --> 09:24.324
Khadijah, what's my problem?

09:24.391 --> 09:25.658
Which one?

09:28.191 --> 09:32.958
Regine, you only date vain,
pretentious, superficial men.

09:34.258 --> 09:37.191
Rich, though.

09:37.258 --> 09:38.691
It's just not fun anymore.

09:38.758 --> 09:41.958
I'm just, I'm just going
through the motions.

09:42.024 --> 09:43.791
[sighs]

09:43.858 --> 09:46.724
‐ May I offer a suggestion?
‐ Mm.

09:46.791 --> 09:49.724
Really? Thanks.

09:49.791 --> 09:51.258
When I registered
for night school

09:51.324 --> 09:53.858
I saw a listing for a seminar.

09:53.924 --> 09:55.791
"Finding The You Within."

09:55.858 --> 09:59.058
It's only $400, and the
instructor's this famous doctor

09:59.124 --> 10:01.964
I saw on Oprah.

10:02.031 --> 10:05.798
She made Oprah and Whoopi cry.

10:05.864 --> 10:08.031
‐ For real?
‐ 'Yes.'

10:08.098 --> 10:12.431
Regine, you are a fool if you
spend one dime on that crap.

10:12.498 --> 10:16.264
But if you need help that bad,
for only 200 I'll make you cry.

10:19.331 --> 10:22.031
‐ Shoot.
‐ Khadijah, please, alright?

10:22.098 --> 10:25.364
If I really want to sit in a
room full of unsatisfied women

10:25.431 --> 10:27.398
yak, yak, yaking
about their problems

10:27.464 --> 10:29.731
I'd stay around
and talk to you all.

10:39.464 --> 10:45.464
I am Dr. Madeline Flaylin
and we are here to live better.

10:45.531 --> 10:48.098
To love better.

10:48.164 --> 10:51.698
To find the you within,
defining ourselves without men.

10:51.764 --> 10:54.198
Welcome back, ladies.
And Dennis.

10:58.831 --> 11:02.738
Fulfill.

11:02.804 --> 11:06.104
Find your life first

11:06.171 --> 11:08.604
if love is to last.

11:12.938 --> 11:17.538
Know yourself.
Need yourself.

11:17.604 --> 11:20.804
Love yourself.

11:20.871 --> 11:23.438
Alright, it's time to stand
and deliver.

11:23.504 --> 11:27.404
Who from last week would like
to start us off?

11:27.471 --> 11:31.238
There are no refunds.
So let's get things moving.

11:33.071 --> 11:35.504
(Max)
'Well, my name is Maxine, and..'

11:41.138 --> 11:44.471
How are we supposed to make pots
up in here without any clay?

11:49.338 --> 11:53.038
Well, well, well, if it isn't
Miss Hornier than thou.

11:53.104 --> 11:54.571
You are in the wrong class.

11:54.638 --> 11:57.604
Gold diggers, promiscuous
is down the hall.

11:57.671 --> 11:59.404
You're calling me promiscuous?

11:59.471 --> 12:01.144
‐ Doctor, question.
‐ Yes.

12:01.211 --> 12:02.944
Is there something wrong
with a woman

12:03.011 --> 12:05.744
who has to have the ceiling fans
removed from her home

12:05.811 --> 12:09.444
because she keeps losing
the heels off of her shoes?

12:11.078 --> 12:13.311
But, doctor, isn't it worse
to be a woman

12:13.378 --> 12:18.044
who thinks of the Fortune 500
as a to do list?

12:18.111 --> 12:21.211
‐ Back, back, back!
‐ Ladies. Ladies!

12:21.278 --> 12:24.978
Now, this room is supposed to be
a safe haven for women.

12:25.044 --> 12:27.111
And Dennis.

12:27.178 --> 12:29.911
'Now, Maxine and..'

12:29.978 --> 12:31.244
Chiquan.

12:33.078 --> 12:36.911
Maxine and Chiquan need
to realize something.

12:36.978 --> 12:41.411
They're both two sides
of the same dysfunctional coin.

12:41.478 --> 12:43.178
'It's all in my second book.'

12:43.244 --> 12:47.878
"Two Sides Of The Same
Dysfunctional Coin."

12:47.944 --> 12:51.611
Now, Maxine and Chiquan,
let's try a little something.

12:51.678 --> 12:54.311
An exercise that you'll find
in your blue workbooks.

12:54.378 --> 12:57.711
It's called Blue Workbook
Exercise Number Two.

12:57.778 --> 13:01.051
It requires a little bit
of self‐revelation.

13:01.118 --> 13:04.384
Now, Max here told us all
about herself last week.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.518
In fact, we had to stay a little
overtime. Didn't we, max?

13:07.584 --> 13:09.451
[no audio]

13:09.518 --> 13:12.451
Max is what I like
to call a loan shark.

13:12.518 --> 13:15.518
She's borrowed some heavy grief
from a few men in her life

13:15.584 --> 13:19.551
and now she wants to pay them
all back with interest.

13:19.618 --> 13:24.484
Now, Chiquan, as if
that's your real name

13:24.551 --> 13:26.518
I'm guessing that you're
in a special category

13:26.584 --> 13:29.918
I like to call Olympians.

13:29.984 --> 13:32.884
I'm an Olympian.

13:32.951 --> 13:35.518
You go for the gold,
but not your own

13:35.584 --> 13:37.184
because you're too afraid
to compete.

13:37.251 --> 13:42.018
You want a man
to run your race for you.

13:42.084 --> 13:45.351
How do you know that?

13:45.418 --> 13:49.384
It's not an exactly
unusual story, Chiquan.

13:49.451 --> 13:51.384
How many in here are Olympians?

13:54.818 --> 13:57.384
I have a home.

13:57.451 --> 14:00.591
Now, this week I want you all
to date yourselves.

14:00.658 --> 14:03.737
That means no rendezvous
with men.

14:03.803 --> 14:05.637
‐ What?
‐ Uh‐uh, uh‐uh.

14:05.703 --> 14:09.937
The point of this exercise is
to spend time with yourself.

14:10.003 --> 14:12.770
Find yourself.

14:12.837 --> 14:15.503
Need yourself.

14:15.570 --> 14:19.103
Love yourself.

14:19.170 --> 14:21.503
Let's take a five minute break.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.803
Everyone out in the hallway.

14:22.870 --> 14:26.337
We have coffee, cookies
and cassette tapes.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.203
Good luck dating yourself,
Chiquan. You're gonna need it.

14:32.270 --> 14:34.003
Lord knows
how you can afford it.

14:34.070 --> 14:35.803
Oh, Max. Hey, girl.

14:35.870 --> 14:39.470
You got a date finally without
yelling at the car window.

14:43.103 --> 14:45.203
Movie starts in 20 minutes.

14:45.270 --> 14:47.303
Come on, Khadijah,
I wanna get there early.

14:47.370 --> 14:50.470
You know the preview
is always better than the movie.

14:53.537 --> 14:55.770
So, uh, Synclaire

14:55.837 --> 14:59.237
any new thoughts on the identity
of your secret admirer?

14:59.303 --> 15:02.577
As a matter of fact, I haven't
heard from him in two days.

15:02.643 --> 15:05.277
But I've been doing
some detective work.

15:05.343 --> 15:07.843
Look at that headline.

15:07.910 --> 15:10.077
‐ Peace pact in the Middle East.
‐ Uh‐huh.

15:10.143 --> 15:15.077
My secret admirer dropped out of
sight just when this happened.

15:15.143 --> 15:17.043
See now, I'm no Regine.

15:17.110 --> 15:20.877
But all fingers point to my guy
being the King of Jordan.

15:22.043 --> 15:23.310
[knock on door]

15:23.377 --> 15:25.843
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I was indisposed.

15:25.910 --> 15:28.677
Hey, did you get that
grey hair out your back?

15:28.743 --> 15:30.410
Overton, please.

15:30.477 --> 15:33.577
He had a devil of a time
reaching, even with the tweeze.

15:33.643 --> 15:35.077
Overton.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.643
You'd have thought it'd be easy.
That sucker wasn't alone.

15:37.710 --> 15:39.777
He was back there just pulling..

15:43.677 --> 15:45.910
Oh. What's this?

15:45.977 --> 15:47.477
It's addressed to me.

15:47.543 --> 15:49.510
I bet it's from Mr. Guess Who.

15:49.577 --> 15:53.043
Does it have
a royal seal on it?

15:53.110 --> 15:54.777
"My dearest Synclaire

15:54.843 --> 15:58.610
"I've been convicted of a
terrible crime I did not commit.

15:58.677 --> 15:59.810
"I have also contracted

15:59.877 --> 16:03.850
"an extremely contagious
skin fungus.

16:03.917 --> 16:08.150
"Further more, I've been drafted
by the French Foreign Legion.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.150
"I feel this means
goodbye forever.

16:10.217 --> 16:12.350
"Yours truly, Guess Who."

16:12.417 --> 16:15.750
‐ Can you believe it?
‐ Ha ha ha. Just barely.

16:17.617 --> 16:20.783
I'm, uh, really sorry
about your friend, Synclaire.

16:20.850 --> 16:22.450
But he didn't
admire you secretly

16:22.517 --> 16:25.050
half as much as I do publicly.

16:28.417 --> 16:31.250
Aw. That's so sweet, Overton.

16:31.317 --> 16:33.417
But Regine's
gonna be devastated.

16:33.483 --> 16:35.750
Ever since she swore off
men yesterday

16:35.817 --> 16:37.983
she has taken
a real interest in this.

16:39.650 --> 16:42.683
Skin fungus?

16:42.750 --> 16:44.383
It was a nice touch man.

16:44.450 --> 16:47.050
Well, I couldn't
spell psoriasis.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.550
You know, Regine, I'm throwing
a seminar of my own next week.

16:52.617 --> 16:54.750
It's only a thousand bucks.

16:54.817 --> 16:59.083
It's called
"My Roommate's A Fool."

16:59.150 --> 17:01.123
Mock if you must.

17:01.190 --> 17:05.257
But dating myself is going
to make me a much better woman.

17:05.323 --> 17:08.923
Lonely and passively bitter,
but better.

17:08.990 --> 17:12.057
If you say so.
Go on, Synclaire.

17:12.123 --> 17:15.490
Regine, I have some bad news
about my secret admirer.

17:15.557 --> 17:17.923
Who cares?

17:17.990 --> 17:19.923
She's in denial.

17:22.623 --> 17:26.190
Alright now, Regine.
You have fun dating yourself.

17:26.257 --> 17:28.923
Have your butt home by 11.

17:28.990 --> 17:30.923
Don't you try anything funny.

17:57.423 --> 18:00.730
Just starting your date?

18:00.797 --> 18:03.830
Mine's over.

18:03.897 --> 18:07.030
Took me all of 12 minutes
to be myself, know myself

18:07.097 --> 18:09.097
love myself.

18:09.163 --> 18:12.397
Quite frankly,
I'm sick of myself.

18:12.463 --> 18:14.630
Well, I'm having a lovely time.

18:14.697 --> 18:18.630
Candlelight, nice dinner,
chocolate.

18:20.063 --> 18:22.730
And later on, I might read
a book with myself

18:22.797 --> 18:26.130
or play dominoes with myself
or call up a radio station

18:26.197 --> 18:29.630
and dedicate a song to myself.

18:29.697 --> 18:31.997
Well, lookee here.

18:32.063 --> 18:35.297
I'm taking my date up town.
You wanna ride shotgun?

18:35.363 --> 18:37.263
You're ridiculous.
I cannot believe you.

18:37.330 --> 18:40.197
You are compromising everything
that we're trying to do

18:40.263 --> 18:42.030
and the whole point
of this seminar.

18:42.097 --> 18:44.597
God, Max.
I don't know about you.

18:44.663 --> 18:48.530
But me, I take my
self‐development very seriously.

18:48.597 --> 18:52.497
I'm only going with you because
my date is dragging me along.

18:59.497 --> 19:00.770
We're waiting.

19:05.203 --> 19:08.503
So she brings this dress
in big pit stains and all

19:08.570 --> 19:11.570
thinking I'll take it back
'cause it has the tags on it.

19:11.637 --> 19:14.503
I said to her, pretty
to look at, nice to hold.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.870
Once you make it stink, sister,
it's sold.

19:17.937 --> 19:19.670
Doesn't she know
if you're gonna return

19:19.737 --> 19:21.270
you've to wear dress shields?

19:21.337 --> 19:22.770
I'm saying.

19:24.637 --> 19:28.070
Oh, this is sad.

19:28.137 --> 19:31.137
The best Saturday night
I've had in months.

19:31.203 --> 19:33.237
And it's with you.

19:33.303 --> 19:36.903
It just goes to show we don't
need men to have a good time.

19:36.970 --> 19:40.503
You don't have to play
the mind games. We're in charge.

19:40.570 --> 19:41.837
Yo. Two more.

19:43.570 --> 19:46.837
I guess once you look at it that
way this is very liberating.

19:46.903 --> 19:50.103
‐ To the sisterhood.
‐ Yes, yes.

19:50.170 --> 19:52.270
I want a man!

19:54.303 --> 19:56.903
Buy me a drink.
Tell me I'm cute.

19:58.703 --> 20:00.943
[weeping]
I'm hopeless.

20:01.010 --> 20:02.610
Alright, okay.

20:02.677 --> 20:04.443
Now Regine,
I know you're in crisis

20:04.510 --> 20:06.577
but you're also
embarrassing me. Okay?

20:06.643 --> 20:07.877
Thank you.

20:07.943 --> 20:10.543
Listen. There is nothing wrong
with wanting a man.

20:10.610 --> 20:13.110
God put them here for us.
It's a beautiful thing.

20:13.177 --> 20:16.277
But they can't complete us.
We have to do that ourselves.

20:16.343 --> 20:18.577
If you are so well adjusted

20:18.643 --> 20:20.743
why are you even
taking the seminar?

20:20.810 --> 20:23.343
Because as much as
I hate to admit it

20:23.410 --> 20:25.143
you and I are
not that different.

20:25.210 --> 20:28.910
I mean, sure, hey,
I've got it going on.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.943
But, uh, lately
my one night stands

20:32.010 --> 20:33.977
haven't been as fulfilling
as they once were

20:34.043 --> 20:37.043
and I knew I hit bottom
one morning when I woke up

20:37.110 --> 20:39.610
next to a strange man
and it was..

20:39.677 --> 20:41.610
[gasps]
...Kyle.

20:41.677 --> 20:42.610
[gasps]

20:42.677 --> 20:44.110
Okay, breathe, breathe, breathe.

20:44.177 --> 20:47.377
Come on, come back, come back.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:47.443 --> 20:52.110
I'm sorry. I‐I didn't mean
to make you relive the incident.

20:54.143 --> 20:57.843
The bottom line is, once we give
ourselves the respect we deserve

20:57.910 --> 21:00.017
we empower ourselves to be free.

21:00.083 --> 21:02.483
Free to choose a man
who deserves us

21:02.550 --> 21:05.217
or to march on by ourselves.

21:05.283 --> 21:07.750
Well, miss girl, you really
do know yourself.

21:07.817 --> 21:09.550
I read in Dr. Madeline's
third book

21:09.617 --> 21:13.017
"Marching On By Ourselves."

21:13.083 --> 21:15.850
Hey, you know what, Max.
I think we're gonna be okay.

21:15.917 --> 21:18.217
I mean, we‐we can do this.

21:18.283 --> 21:22.583
Take tonight. We did...we did
okay without men.

21:22.650 --> 21:25.983
Are you kidding me?
We excelled without them.

21:26.050 --> 21:30.550

'So what are you saying?
That I'm your secret admirer?'

22:11.305 --> 22:13.171
'Be serious, Synclaire.'

I'm Superman.'
