14:02.126 --> 14:04.914
I've been through hell and
high water looking for you.

14:05.173 --> 14:06.685
Do me a favor, hon.

14:06.687 --> 14:09.572
You put that thing down, step on over here.

14:10.545 --> 14:13.192
- What are you doing here, Captain?
- Shut your trap.

14:13.194 --> 14:16.195
Slide your firearm.
This ain't a social call.

14:16.698 --> 14:19.414
Okay, okay. Take it easy.

14:19.534 --> 14:22.201
Now, where the hell are those bonds?

14:22.203 --> 14:23.836
I'm sorry, sir, what bonds?

14:23.871 --> 14:25.949
Oh, don't get fresh with me, boy.

14:26.424 --> 14:28.560
You see, we found Tony Mendoza's car,

14:28.616 --> 14:30.426
and his GPS was all jacked up.

14:30.461 --> 14:32.878
But hell if the techs
still didn't still find

14:32.880 --> 14:35.097
that he was parked at your
house the night he went missing.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.889
So I got curious.

14:38.769 --> 14:41.387
Turns out you borrowed four million dollars

14:41.439 --> 14:43.606
in bearer bonds from FBI Evidence.

14:43.641 --> 14:46.108
A federal offense, by the by.

14:46.291 --> 14:49.795
So where the hell are those bonds?

14:50.064 --> 14:51.029
Okay,

14:51.866 --> 14:53.399
wait, you think I killed Tony?

14:53.451 --> 14:55.901
And yet you come out here, all alone?

14:55.903 --> 14:57.286
You're damn straight I did.

14:57.321 --> 14:59.622
I endorsed your reinstatement, Ranger.

14:59.657 --> 15:02.908
That means you shit the bed and
I gotta clean the sheets now.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.966
Thing is, sir,

15:05.925 --> 15:08.271
captains don't endorse reinstatements.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.283
- They don't?
- Nope.

15:11.802 --> 15:13.447
I don't know who the hell you are,

15:13.919 --> 15:16.493
but you sure as shit ain't Chance Holbrook.

15:20.042 --> 15:21.753
[laughs]

15:22.540 --> 15:24.545
Well, you got me there.

15:25.316 --> 15:27.028
Déjà vu,<i> Rinche?</i>

15:33.235 --> 15:35.437
You son of a bitch.
Holbrook was a good man.

15:35.457 --> 15:36.716
Ooh, are you sure about that?

15:36.762 --> 15:39.366
Because he was going to
finger you for Tony's murder.

15:43.307 --> 15:45.825
[grunting]

15:45.945 --> 15:48.023
- Come on, come on...
- Hey, hey!

15:48.143 --> 15:50.964
- I wouldn't do that, Kate.
- Scott...

15:52.029 --> 15:53.649
Agh!

15:54.370 --> 15:55.995
Holy shit, you shot me!

16:02.668 --> 16:04.256
[grunting]

16:04.376 --> 16:05.947
Let's go! Come on!

16:07.506 --> 16:09.706
[grunting]

16:12.669 --> 16:14.510
- [pounding on door]
- [Carlos] Open up,<i> rinchesito!</i>

16:14.533 --> 16:17.071
It's too late, Carlos. Your
boss already took the key.

16:17.091 --> 16:20.376
It is useless without the
map. Hand over the bonds,

16:20.636 --> 16:22.244
because I am not leaving without them.

16:22.275 --> 16:23.854
Well, then I guess you're not leaving.

16:23.889 --> 16:25.355
[loud grunt]

16:25.621 --> 16:27.307
[Carlos] Oh, Federico.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.110
You're not <i>Buffy La Caza Vampiros!</i>

16:30.145 --> 16:31.460
[loud pounding]

16:31.506 --> 16:33.446
You're the <i> Tlacamelli Teplani.</i>

16:33.482 --> 16:34.812
The Peacekeeper.

16:34.852 --> 16:36.467
Yeah, that's what people keep tellin' me.

16:36.543 --> 16:38.128
[grunting]

16:38.821 --> 16:40.722
[Carlos] Gonzalez...

16:42.157 --> 16:44.703
- ... you are a man of justice.
- [groans]

16:44.823 --> 16:47.708
[Carlos] Yeah, a man like you understands.

16:48.272 --> 16:50.831
Oh, you understand that
this <i> santa sangre</i>

16:50.833 --> 16:53.550
could keep <i> culebras</i>
from preying on innocents.

16:53.585 --> 16:55.792
You understand what that means?

16:56.803 --> 16:58.646
Less exposure for us,

16:58.925 --> 17:00.763
and more peace for you.

17:00.883 --> 17:03.260
I'm starting to think peace is overrated.

17:05.396 --> 17:07.663
I'm starving. Why couldn't we stop to feed?

17:08.373 --> 17:11.907
Because we are here for a higher purpose!

17:14.940 --> 17:17.858
[shouting]

17:21.342 --> 17:22.996
[Richie] What the hell is he up to?

17:23.031 --> 17:24.580
I still don't feel right about this.

17:24.616 --> 17:26.199
You will, once you have the plans.

17:26.592 --> 17:28.535
Okay, remember, you
just need to distract him

17:28.537 --> 17:29.664
while I switch out the cases.

17:29.689 --> 17:30.740
I've got it.

17:31.005 --> 17:33.456
Okay, Richard? Relax.

17:35.126 --> 17:37.093
[Eddie] <i> So what is all this?</i>

17:38.031 --> 17:40.839
I told you, I got about a
hundred VHS tapes in here.

17:40.854 --> 17:42.348
From Fellini to Capra.

17:42.942 --> 17:45.635
- You want some or not?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put 'em over there somewhere.

17:45.891 --> 17:48.521
<i>Tío</i> Eduardo, I hear
you make a great coffee.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.974
Well, as a matter of fact, I do, Miss...

17:52.193 --> 17:54.833
- Santanico.
- Ah, Santanico Pandemonium.

17:55.133 --> 17:57.530
That's right, you told
me. Santanico Pandemonium.

17:57.788 --> 17:59.885
- Would you care for a cup?
- Please.

18:00.368 --> 18:02.652
- [coffee pouring]
- [Eddie] Santanico. Where do I know that name from?

18:02.654 --> 18:05.955
[Santanico] Oh, I used to be
in a famous show in Mexico.

18:05.990 --> 18:08.157
And now you wanna kill
the CEO of the Browns.

18:08.209 --> 18:10.750
- Jesus, Eddie.
- Take it easy. It ain't my lingo.

18:10.780 --> 18:14.879
Amancio Malvado, the head of
the "Browns," as you call him,

18:14.999 --> 18:16.386
he deserves to die.

18:16.506 --> 18:18.798
Mm. Whatever you say, San...

18:20.798 --> 18:22.372
That's where I know you from.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.906
Jesus Christ, you... you got
the same name as that chick

18:24.916 --> 18:26.941
in that famous Mexican horror flick.

18:26.957 --> 18:28.506
I even got a copy. You're gonna love it.

18:28.765 --> 18:29.978
What are you doin' over there?

18:31.466 --> 18:32.741
- What?
- What are you doin'?

18:33.944 --> 18:35.685
Nothing, I'm just lookin', uh,

18:35.737 --> 18:37.858
lookin' for a place to put those tapes.

18:46.197 --> 18:48.781
- What's this? This ain't mine.
- It's nothin'.

18:53.442 --> 18:56.508
You little shit, you were
gonna switch the cases!

18:57.793 --> 18:59.258
All right, who are you, sweetheart?

18:59.293 --> 19:00.906
- [Richie] Eddie, put that down.
- Shut up!

19:01.429 --> 19:03.511
Who are you? You come in here with your

19:03.673 --> 19:05.557
fancy lipstick and your fake name.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.207
- How do I know you don't work for those guys?
- Eddie, just stop!

19:08.269 --> 19:10.371
- Shut the fuck up.
- You don't.

19:11.082 --> 19:12.590
But let me tell you about

19:13.148 --> 19:14.611
when I was a little girl,

19:14.626 --> 19:17.777
and Amancio killed my whole family
and took me out of my pueblo.

19:17.812 --> 19:20.362
Or the thousands of
innocents he sacrificed,

19:20.398 --> 19:23.771
or the many, many years I was his slave.

19:24.989 --> 19:27.286
But at the end of the
day, does it really matter?

19:27.579 --> 19:29.905
Because the only way for you to trust me

19:29.957 --> 19:32.520
is for you to believe that I want him dead

19:32.794 --> 19:34.744
as much as you want his money.

19:39.131 --> 19:41.250
So, what do you say, Eddie?

19:41.252 --> 19:43.462
I say you broke the code, kid.

19:49.427 --> 19:52.061
Oh, that fuck! Where's my shit?!

19:52.393 --> 19:54.764
- Seth took it.
- He what?

19:54.766 --> 19:57.959
- I knew he was up to somethin'.
- And I can tell you where,

19:58.603 --> 20:01.437
- but I want in on the job.
- What is this, a potluck?!

20:01.489 --> 20:03.823
Eddie, look, okay?

20:04.051 --> 20:06.691
I know you're pissed, and
you have every right to be.

20:06.762 --> 20:07.925
I messed up.

20:08.402 --> 20:10.196
Gimme a chance to make this right.

20:15.453 --> 20:17.318
Larry, Larry.

20:17.490 --> 20:19.705
Lawrence. Come on, man.

20:20.142 --> 20:22.371
You gotta stop taking things so personally.

20:22.538 --> 20:25.511
- You put my partner in traction.
- That was all business.

20:25.696 --> 20:29.131
That's my beautifully restored
Cutlass 442 you're driving.

20:29.183 --> 20:30.466
Okay, that was pleasure.

20:30.518 --> 20:31.504
But...

20:32.652 --> 20:34.519
now, here I am,

20:34.639 --> 20:37.473
offering you the payday of a lifetime

20:37.525 --> 20:39.358
as a gesture of good faith.

20:40.027 --> 20:41.446
And trust me,

20:41.989 --> 20:44.284
you do not find plays like this for sale.

20:44.757 --> 20:46.407
All you need to do

20:46.966 --> 20:48.301
is find yourself a crew.

20:48.342 --> 20:51.785
Then you can buy yourself a
whole factory of Cutlasses,

20:51.823 --> 20:54.136
like that. [Snaps] Huh?

20:57.462 --> 21:00.270
- Okay, sold.
- Okay.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.953
- Where is it, Seth?
- Sorry, Richard.

21:12.364 --> 21:15.131
Larry here just bought himself
a 33 million dollar payday.

21:18.232 --> 21:19.925
Take it easy, pal.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.708
- I'm warnin' you.
- Ah!

21:29.694 --> 21:32.361
[exhales]

21:32.363 --> 21:35.414
- [growling]
- What the hell, man?

21:35.449 --> 21:38.033
- [roaring]
- Ah!

21:40.087 --> 21:41.620
What the hell is your problem?

21:43.541 --> 21:46.208
Ah! This job is the old man's dream.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.499
You're just usin' him
to keep your bitch happy.

21:48.619 --> 21:49.929
[grunting]

21:49.964 --> 21:51.881
So that's why you hate <i>
culebras</i> so much.

21:51.883 --> 21:53.904
It's not because you're
scared we're gonna eat you,

21:53.935 --> 21:55.549
- it's because of her.
- Bingo.

21:55.603 --> 21:57.240
Ah!

22:03.277 --> 22:05.867
[Malvado] <i> Could it be
that this sacred bond</i>

22:05.907 --> 22:08.564
between brothers has finally snapped?

22:08.616 --> 22:10.399
Where do you think I got this?

22:10.451 --> 22:12.346
I believe it, you know.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.103
In fact, this brother I visited, Celestino,

22:16.223 --> 22:17.740
he was a real <i>hijo de una puta.</i>

22:17.860 --> 22:20.626
I remember the day that
I finally accepted it.

22:20.661 --> 22:23.238
But I hated him for so much of my life.

22:24.582 --> 22:26.916
It was like a dam broke inside of me,

22:26.968 --> 22:28.801
releasing a torrent of hatred.

22:28.836 --> 22:30.803
Was that the same dam that
released the torrent of bullshit

22:30.838 --> 22:32.457
that's comin' out of your mouth right now?

22:34.260 --> 22:36.114
Do me a favor, tough guy, okay?

22:36.155 --> 22:39.094
Don't tell me this is about some
epic clash between two brothers.

22:39.430 --> 22:42.097
This is about you and your needs.

22:43.601 --> 22:45.768
Cut to the chase, Gecko,

22:46.147 --> 22:48.070
or this will become a feeding ground.

22:48.105 --> 22:50.489
I used to think that she
was just a dancing girl.

22:50.524 --> 22:53.246
But now, now I get it.

22:53.945 --> 22:55.576
She's your queen.

22:55.906 --> 22:58.287
That's why I'm gonna bring her back to you.

22:58.303 --> 22:59.837
Your headliner.

23:00.872 --> 23:04.320
I'm gonna bring you back
Santanico Pandemonium.

23:15.693 --> 23:17.450
Kate, help me move this rack.

23:17.673 --> 23:20.264
Come on! Come on, let's go!
We gotta get out of here!

23:20.299 --> 23:22.217
- [Carlos] Gonzalez!
- Ready? One, two, three.

23:22.258 --> 23:23.801
[grunting]

23:23.872 --> 23:26.356
I am trying to be civil here!

23:26.476 --> 23:28.571
- [pounding]
- You know, maybe...

23:28.691 --> 23:30.779
- Maybe he's not wrong.
- About what?

23:30.805 --> 23:33.613
About the blood well not
being such a bad idea.

23:33.668 --> 23:35.735
It could keep the <i>
culebras</i> from killing.

23:35.776 --> 23:37.715
You don't seriously believe
anything he says, do you?

23:37.746 --> 23:40.867
No, I've been trying to
find a way for Scott to feed

23:40.868 --> 23:42.657
without killing ever since Mexico.

23:42.777 --> 23:44.418
This could be his second chance.

23:44.459 --> 23:46.032
What about those kids he killed?

23:46.067 --> 23:47.566
Do they get a second chance?

23:47.618 --> 23:49.819
[Carlos] Give me the goddamn bonds!

23:56.296 --> 23:57.660
[pounding]

23:58.916 --> 24:00.084
Come on!

24:04.969 --> 24:06.885
I'm coming, my little piggies!

24:06.918 --> 24:09.565
And I'm gonna make myself some
<i>chicharron de rinche!</i>

24:10.631 --> 24:12.017
Let's go!

24:16.014 --> 24:17.343
Go get 'em,<i> cabrón!</i>

24:19.187 --> 24:20.399
[sniffs]

24:24.939 --> 24:26.783
[sniffs]

24:27.108 --> 24:28.611
[Scott] Kate! Get back here!

24:29.941 --> 24:31.738
They're too weak and
hungry, they can't follow us.

24:31.753 --> 24:32.945
Come on!

24:33.876 --> 24:34.881
Stop!

24:36.089 --> 24:37.511
What are you doin'?

24:38.267 --> 24:39.405
Give me the bonds.

24:39.525 --> 24:40.674
You're not gonna shoot.

24:45.346 --> 24:47.088
Look, I know it's hard to let family go.

24:47.108 --> 24:48.494
Just give me the bonds,

24:48.614 --> 24:51.002
or I swear to God the next
one goes in your kneecap.

24:54.419 --> 24:57.019
Now, cuff yourself to the
truck and throw me the keys.

24:57.055 --> 24:58.136
Do it.

25:09.650 --> 25:13.059
- You're making a huge mistake.
- No.

25:15.323 --> 25:17.349
I am making up for one.

25:40.627 --> 25:42.681
[slurping]

25:45.937 --> 25:48.854
[cracking sound]

25:48.856 --> 25:51.690
[grunts, gasps]

26:08.209 --> 26:09.291
Scott?

26:11.546 --> 26:12.667
Scott.

26:14.368 --> 26:15.383
Oh!

26:18.553 --> 26:19.468
[groans]

26:23.441 --> 26:25.691
Boy, if Dad could see you now.

26:26.071 --> 26:29.061
I am doing what he asked me to do.

26:29.336 --> 26:30.980
I'm trying to help you.

26:33.384 --> 26:35.226
I know you want the bonds.

26:35.486 --> 26:38.621
- I can give them to you.
- And why would you do that?

- It's not your fault.

I don't know how he found
me. I thought I had lost him,

but maybe Malvado can
sense me getting closer.

41:49.604 --> 41:51.854
Wait, he can sense you?

41:51.856 --> 41:54.046
He's a Lord, Richard.

41:54.567 --> 41:55.790
He made me.

41:55.910 --> 42:00.153
So he can get inside your
head, like you do to me?

42:01.032 --> 42:02.451
Worse.

42:03.587 --> 42:06.467
Well, can he sense other <i> culebras?</i>

42:07.344 --> 42:11.707
- Can he sense me?
- I don't know. I thought I knew what Malvado could do,

42:12.004 --> 42:14.210
but I guess I'm not so sure.

42:15.713 --> 42:18.347
Well, I guess we're gonna have to find out.

42:35.817 --> 42:39.785
True, and yet you, me,

42:39.821 --> 42:42.571
Carlos, Richard, we're all fools for her.

42:42.623 --> 42:43.572
No.

42:43.624 --> 42:45.041
I may be a selfish,

42:45.076 --> 42:46.625

42:46.661 --> 42:48.461

43:50.475 --> 43:52.250
Oh, I wouldn't worry about him.

43:52.682 --> 43:54.085
He's just whipped.

43:57.482 --> 43:59.144
Don't I know you somehow?

44:01.986 --> 44:03.285
I don't think so.

44:03.321 --> 44:05.488
[snaps] Go wait by the door.

44:12.380 --> 44:14.080
So we have a deal?

44:24.572 --> 44:29.311
You cross me, and I will skin
you and your girlfriend alive

44:29.347 --> 44:32.860
and make myself a brand-new
pair of <i> calzones.</i>

44:33.568 --> 44:36.185
- Whatever those are.
- [man] One, two, three, four!

44:36.187 --> 44:39.021
[rock music plays]

44:59.852 --> 45:02.651
- He bought it.
- Yes, he did.

45:03.131 --> 45:05.548
More importantly, he
had no idea it was you.

45:05.600 --> 45:08.053
Yeah, but was all that really
necessary? I am not whipped.

45:08.097 --> 45:10.186
It's all part of the play, Richard.

45:10.221 --> 45:12.354
- Not my play.
- No.

45:12.390 --> 45:13.556
Uncle Eddie's play.
