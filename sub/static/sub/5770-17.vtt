08:36.254 --> 08:37.821
SHE'S ALWAYS
CONFIDING IN ME.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.388
I GUESS

13:37.860 --> 13:39.731
I WONDER WHY

13:39.775 --> 13:43.213
'CAUSE IT'S 40 OUNCES

13:43.257 --> 13:45.825

14:18.814 --> 14:21.121
OKAY, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.818
THE CAR'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.994
BEVERLY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.083
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
ABOUT BEING PROMOTED?

14:27.127 --> 14:28.868
REALLY?

14:28.911 --> 14:31.522
ARE YOU OFFERING ME
MY OLD NURSING GIG?

14:31.566 --> 14:32.828
OH, NO, HELL NO.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.916
NO, YOU WERE A TERRIBLE NURSE.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.004
YOU SHOULD HAVE
YOUR LICENSE REVOKED.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.311
BUT WE'VE BEEN
PRETTY BUSY.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.921
WE COULD USE SOME HELP.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.315
HOW ABOUT
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY?

14:41.358 --> 14:44.057
MAYBE YOU COULD
BURP LESS.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.363
WELL, IT BEATS
BUSSING TABLES.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.062
GONNA MISS THE BOYS
IN THE KITCHEN THOUGH.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.020
BUT NOT THE KNIFE FIGHTS.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.631
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.070
I'M GONNA CALL THE GUYS,
LET THEM KNOW.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.943
HEY, GUYS!

15:00.987 --> 15:03.903

CAREFUL, EVERYONE.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.212
A CHILD FELL DOWN A MANHOLE,

15:09.256 --> 15:10.648
BUT HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.[applause]

15:10.692 --> 15:12.520
[Danny]
NOT A CHILD.
FULL-GROWN MAN.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.305
NO, DON'T CLAP.
DON'T CLAP, OKAY?

15:15.349 --> 15:17.394
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO SAY
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE?

15:17.438 --> 15:18.918
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.181
I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS
REALLY SOMETHING TO SEE.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.834
DANNY, WE'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND.

15:22.878 --> 15:23.792
I'M GREAT, ALEX.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.402
THAT A BOY, DANNY.
BE BRAVE.

15:25.446 --> 15:26.316
[Morgan]
THIS IS REALLY
A JOINT EFFORT

15:26.360 --> 15:27.404
BETWEEN
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,

15:27.448 --> 15:28.928
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,
AND MYSELF.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.277
WE ALL REALLY
BANDED TOGETHER

15:30.320 --> 15:32.670
TO SAVE THE LIFE
OF DR. DANIEL CASTELLANO.

15:32.714 --> 15:35.021
NO, DON'T SAY MY NAME
ON TV!

15:35.064 --> 15:36.065
OF STATEN ISLAND.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.240
SINGLE GUY, LADIES.

[siren whoops]

15:41.592 --> 15:43.464
CHERRY-FLAVORED.
CHERRY-FLAVORED.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.595
OH, MY GOD, DANNY!

15:44.639 --> 15:45.901
I CAN'T BELIEVE--
MOVE, MOVE.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.642
DANNY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU WOULD SACRIFICE

15:47.685 --> 15:49.992
THE USE OF YOUR LEGS TO COME
AND FIND ME ON MY BIRTHDAY.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.168
THAT IS THE MOST AMAZING THING
I HAVE EVER HEARD,

15:52.212 --> 15:53.822
AND EVERYTHING MEAN THAT
YOU HAVE EVER SAID TO ME,

15:53.865 --> 15:55.693
I FORGIVE YOU,
MY SWEET, SWEET FRIEND.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.695
I DON'T CARE
THAT YOU'RE PARALYZED.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.219
I WILL COME,
AND I WILL READ BOOKS TO YOU.

15:59.262 --> 16:00.220
OKAY.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.786
AND, DANNY,
IF THEY TELL YOU

16:01.830 --> 16:03.353
THAT YOU CAN'T
HAVE CHILDREN

16:03.397 --> 16:05.660
BECAUSE YOUR PENIS
DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE,

16:05.703 --> 16:08.576
IF WE'LL GET YOU, LIKE,
A SEX SURROGATE OR SOMETHING,

16:08.619 --> 16:10.491
THEY CAN BRING
YOUR LOINS BACK TO LIFE.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.232
MIND, I--
I REALLY CARE
ABOUT YOU.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.669
OKAY, I FRACTURED
MY ANKLE, MINDY.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.497
SO I'M FINE.
WAIT, WHAT?

16:16.540 --> 16:18.020
HE'S TOTALLY FINE.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.022
SO YOUR--
YOUR PENIS WORKS?

16:20.066 --> 16:21.284
I HOPE SO.

16:21.328 --> 16:24.635
HUH, KIND OF A MISLEADING TEXT,
I WOULD SAY.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.028
WELL, WHAT I BELIEVE
I TEXTED IS

16:26.072 --> 16:29.249
"I AM PARALYZED WITH FEAR
FOR WHAT HAPPENED."

16:29.292 --> 16:31.381
AND THE PENIS THING,
I WAS JUST GUESSING.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.861
I WAS PANICKED.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.254
HEY, GANG, THIS IS NICE.

16:34.297 --> 16:35.516
BEVERLY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:35.559 --> 16:36.560
OW, SHE PINCHED ME.

16:36.604 --> 16:37.953
DON'T BE THEATRICAL, BETSY.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.259
GUYS, I RAN INTO
BEVERLY TONIGHT,

16:39.302 --> 16:43.089
AND SHE KINDA SAVED ME
IN A TOUGH SITUATION.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.047
SHE SAID SOME THINGS THAT MADE
ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF,

16:45.091 --> 16:48.007
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO
BE FRIENDS NOW.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.965
[Morgan]
DR. L, YOU WANNA
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.054
LET ME TELL YOU THREE THINGS.
ONE IS PROFESSIONAL.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.142
OKAY.
ONE IS EMOTIONAL.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.057
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.ONE IS PHYSICAL.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.189
NO, I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.755
MORGAN, PLEASE JUST
KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

16:57.799 --> 16:58.930
NEVER TELL ME.
I BEG OF YOU.

17:00.845 --> 17:01.933
MINDY.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.935
FINALLY. HI.

17:03.979 --> 17:07.287
WE WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR GETTING YOU PRESENTS

17:07.330 --> 17:09.854
THAT MAKE YOU SEEM
LIKE A FAT LOSER.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.726
WHICH YOU ARE
OBVIOUSLY NOT.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.989
FOR THE RECORD, I HAVE
NOTHING TO BE SORRY FOR.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.078
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WAS ACTING
LIKE A SPOILED PRINCESS.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.253
MAGGIE!
COME ON!

17:17.297 --> 17:19.429

HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

17:19.473 --> 17:20.909
OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
SHE'S NOT INCORRECT.

17:20.952 --> 17:21.910
I ACTED LIKE A CHILD,

17:21.953 --> 17:23.520
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN OUT,

17:23.564 --> 17:25.435
AND THE PRESENTS
WEREN'T BAD.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.002
I JUST, I THINK THOSE

17:27.046 --> 17:29.091
THAT I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET MYSELF.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.571

OH, MY GOD, THANK YOU.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.629
YOU GUYS THINK
THIS IS SO DISGUSTING.

17:45.673 --> 17:46.891
NO.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.988
THAT IS THE MIDWIFE GUY
WHO USED HER FOR HER BOD.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.207
[Alex]
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:58.251 --> 17:59.904
DID YOU USE OUR FRIEND
FOR HER BOD?

17:59.948 --> 18:01.297
I'D SAY IT WAS
A MISUNDERSTANDING--

18:01.341 --> 18:02.298
OH, BOO!

18:02.342 --> 18:04.170
GUYS, GUYS, STOP, STOP.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.562
DON'T KEEP WASTING FOOD.

18:05.606 --> 18:06.737
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.609
OKAY, THAT WAS AWESOME.
HE DESERVED THAT.

18:08.652 --> 18:09.653
NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.351
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

18:11.394 --> 18:12.482
ALL OF MY COWORKERS HATE YOU,

18:12.526 --> 18:13.744
AND YOU WERE VERY CLEAR

18:13.788 --> 18:15.964
ABOUT ME NOT BEING
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.705
LOOK, I KNOW SOMETIMES
I CAN COME ACROSS

18:17.748 --> 18:19.750
A LITTLE OVERLY SELF-ASSURED.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.665
EH, ARROGANT,
PRETENTIOUS.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.058
OKAY.
AND PEDANTIC.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.320
ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
YOU'RE RIGHT, OKAY?

18:24.364 --> 18:25.974
DUNCAN THINKS
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO

18:26.017 --> 18:27.758
WITH OUR CHILDHOOD
ACTING CAREER.

18:27.802 --> 18:28.890
WHAT?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.283
I WAS THE KID
WHO STOLE A PACK OF GUM

18:30.326 --> 18:31.936
IN THE FIRST COMMERCIAL
WITH MCGRUFF THE CRIME DOG.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.329
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:33.373 --> 18:34.548
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME?

18:34.591 --> 18:35.897
YOU WERE TREMBLING ON
THE WAY TO THE DOOR,

18:35.940 --> 18:37.551
'CAUSE YOU COULDN'T TAKE
THE PRESSURE OF STEALING IT.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.292
CAN I TELL YOU, I WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE TREMBLING.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.858
I WAS A VERY ANXIOUS KID.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.164
I USED TO PASS OUT
A LOT ON CAMERA.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.557
AND SO I'VE LEARNED
TO OVERCOMPENSATE

18:43.600 --> 18:44.906
WITH FALSE CONFIDENCE.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.299
ANYWAY,
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.866
THE POINT IS I TREATED YOU
IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT NICE.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.172
TERRIBLY, AWFULLY.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.478
I CRIED EVERY NIGHT.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.828
I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I GOT YOU THIS.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.046
THANK YOU.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.874

18:56.918 --> 19:00.095
SO THAT GUANTANAMO INMATES CAN
HAVE SOCCER BALLS OR SOMETHING?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.618
NO, ALTHOUGH THE LIMITS
ON THOSE GUYS' LEISURE TIME

19:01.662 --> 19:02.880
IS A SHOCK
TO THE CONSCIENCE.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.186
UGH.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.278
UH, MY BIRTHDAY GIFT TO YOU

19:52.321 --> 19:54.932

FULL-BODY MASSAGES.

HEY, I'M DONE.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.290
AS A DOCTOR,

20:04.333 --> 20:07.554
THAT'S PRETTY COOL,

20:07.597 --> 20:08.946
I'VE COME TO PRAY
FOR BABY DANIEL.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.861
THE NEWS SAID

20:10.905 --> 20:12.515
HE FELL IN A MANHOLE.

20:12.559 --> 20:16.345
