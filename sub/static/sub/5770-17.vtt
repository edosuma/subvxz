WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:04.352
SIMONE, I LOVE MY FEDORA.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

00:04.395 --> 00:05.657
I WROTE YOUR NAME
IN RHINESTONES

00:05.701 --> 00:06.789
UNTIL I RAN OUT.

00:06.832 --> 00:07.877
WELL, I WILL CHERISH IT.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.444
NOW, LITTLE TAMBERT
IS DOING GREAT.

00:09.487 --> 00:10.575
HOWEVER,
I HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:10.619 --> 00:12.142
REGARDING YOUR HEALTH,

00:12.186 --> 00:14.144
WHICH MAY RISK
AFFECTING THE PREGNANCY.

00:14.188 --> 00:17.060
CHIEF AMONG THEM

00:17.104 --> 00:18.453
BEING YOUR...

00:18.496 --> 00:21.064
JUST YOU'RE
A LITTLE BIT...

00:21.108 --> 00:22.979
JUST ONE SECOND.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.372
MINDY.

00:24.415 --> 00:25.764
OOH, COOL HAT. I NEED YOUR HELP.

00:25.808 --> 00:27.897
I NEED YOU TO TELL
MY FAVORITE PATIENT SHE'S FAT.

00:27.940 --> 00:28.898
WHAT? NO.

00:28.941 --> 00:29.986
PLEASE, I CAN'T TELL HER.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.335
SHE LOVES ME.
IT WOULD BREAK HER.

00:31.379 --> 00:32.293
ALL RIGHT.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.990
DR. LAHIRI, HOW DARE YOU.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.079
I THINK SHE LOOKS GORGEOUS
THE WAY SHE IS.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.124
BUT, WHAT, SHE NEEDS
TO LOSE WEIGHT NOW?

00:37.167 --> 00:39.256
OKAY, RELAX.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.128
OKAY, YES,
YOU COULD LOSE SOME WEIGHT.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.303
I'M SORRY.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.087
LOSE WEIGHT
WHILE I'M PREGNANT?

00:44.131 --> 00:46.089
I'VE NEVER HEARD
OF ANYTHING SO CRAZY.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.396
I KNOW, BUT CERTAIN
COMPLICATIONS CAN ARISE WHEN--

00:48.439 --> 00:49.788
YOU LOSE WEIGHT.EXCUSE ME?

00:49.832 --> 00:51.007
YOU HEARD ME.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.008
YOU'RE NO KEIRA KNIGHTLEY.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.401
FIRST OF ALL,
I AM NOT OVERWEIGHT.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.185
I FLUCTUATE BETWEEN
CHUBBY AND CURVY.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.882
SECOND OF ALL, I AM NOT THE PREGNANT ONE HERE.

00:56.926 --> 00:57.883
YOU'RE NOT?

00:57.927 --> 00:59.102
I COULDA SWORN.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.147
I COULDA SWORN
THAT YOU WERE A BOUNCER

01:00.190 --> 01:01.278
AT AN ORLANDO STRIP CLUB,

01:01.322 --> 01:02.453
BUT I KEPT THAT
TO MYSELF.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.715
OKAY, OKAY,
I THINK WE'RE LOSING TRACK

01:03.759 --> 01:05.152
OF THE ISSUE HERE, OKAY?

01:05.195 --> 01:06.283
WHICH IS THAT
YOU ARE A GORGEOUS,

01:06.327 --> 01:08.111
RUBENESQUE PLUM,

01:08.155 --> 01:09.765
AND IF IT WAS UP TO ME,
YOU'D GAIN WEIGHT.

01:09.808 --> 01:11.680
NO, NO, NO, NO.AND YOU WOULD LOVE IT,
WOULDN'T YOU, JIMMY?

01:11.723 --> 01:14.248
IF YOU DO NOT LOSE WEIGHT,
SIMONE,

01:14.291 --> 01:17.077
YOUR BABY
WILL BE PUT AT RISK.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.469
I--I HATE THIS.

01:18.513 --> 01:21.037
I THINK YOU ARE PERFECT,
BUT, I DON'T KNOW,

01:21.081 --> 01:23.344
MAYBE THERE'S SOME VALIDITY
TO WHAT THIS WOMAN IS SAYING.

01:23.387 --> 01:24.780
I KNOW THIS IS
GONNA BE TOUGH,

01:24.823 --> 01:26.434
BUT WE SHOULD LISTEN
TO DR. REED.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.609
ACTUALLY,
IT WAS ME WHO--

01:27.652 --> 01:28.784
YOU'RE RIGHT, DR. REED.

01:28.827 --> 01:31.439
YOU AND ME, WE BOTH
GOTTA FACE THE FACTS

01:31.482 --> 01:32.744
AND LOSE SOME WEIGHT.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.050
NO, I'M NOT IN THIS--

01:34.094 --> 01:36.705
IT'S FOR OUR HEALTH.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.228
YEAH, OKAY.

01:38.272 --> 01:39.360
IT'S A BRAVE STEP, MINDY.

PLAY IT FOR MOM AND DAD.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.739
SO HOW ARE YOU CELEBRATING?

02:10.782 --> 02:12.306
I AM ACTUALLY
SPENDING MY BIRTHDAY

02:12.349 --> 02:13.959
GOING ON A BLIND DATE.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.439
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE MIDWIFE DUDE

02:15.483 --> 02:16.397
THAT YOU WERE
GETTING WEIRD WITH?

02:16.440 --> 02:18.399
OH, BRENDAN?
HE'S DEAD, YEAH.

02:18.442 --> 02:19.835
HE GOT HIT BY A BUS.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.184
SICK!

02:21.228 --> 02:23.186
I AM GOING ON A DATE
WITH A SOPHISTICATED GENTLEMAN

02:23.230 --> 02:24.492
THAT I MET ON THE INTERNET.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.450
HE LOOKS EXACTLY
LIKE TOPHER GRACE.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.495
HUH?

02:27.538 --> 02:29.845
TOPHER GRACE FROM THAT '70s SHOW.

02:29.888 --> 02:32.108
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER
A SHOW FROM THE '70s, DUDE?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.631
I WAS BORN IN 1991.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.416
UGH, OKAY.
RISHI, I GOTTA GO.

02:35.459 --> 02:36.852

02:49.952 --> 02:51.693
YOU CAN'T BE HERE,
YOU CAN'T BE HERE,

02:51.736 --> 02:53.260
'CAUSE I'M GOING
ON A FIRST DATE,

02:53.303 --> 02:55.523
A BLIND DATE WITH A REALLY
PROMISING CUTE GUY WHO LOOKS--

02:55.566 --> 02:56.959
A LITTLE BIT
LIKE TOPHER GRACE?

02:57.002 --> 02:58.526
OH!

02:58.569 --> 03:00.267
YOU'RE ZACH PEABODY?

03:00.310 --> 03:02.138

03:02.182 --> 03:03.400
6'1", 185 POUNDS.

03:03.444 --> 03:05.576
FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE,
SOCIAL LIBERAL.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.491
MORGAN, YOU SET UP A FAKE
PROFILE ACCOUNT ON FACEBOOK

03:07.535 --> 03:08.536
AND THEN ASKED ME OUT ON IT?

03:08.579 --> 03:10.277
IT WAS ALL A RUSE.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.278
SORRY, WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT
THE WHOLE FAKE DATE THING.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.193
BUT IT GOT YOU HERE.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.499
GUYS, I JUST, I REALLY DIDN'T
WANT A BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS YEAR.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.155
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
MISS MINDY.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.461
OLGA, MY HOUSEKEEPER.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.985
I WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE GUEST LIST,

03:23.028 --> 03:24.552
AND SO I HAD MORGAN
BLAST YOUR CONTACTS.

03:24.595 --> 03:25.944
OH, MY GOD.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.207
IS THAT MY PLUMBER?

03:27.250 --> 03:28.512
AND MY OLD PLUMBER?

03:28.556 --> 03:29.513
THAT'S GONNA BE AWKWARD.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.254
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THAT GUY IS.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.603
[Morgan]
THAT IS THE GENTLEMAN
YOU REAR-ENDED

03:32.647 --> 03:33.822
IN THE HAMPTONS
LAST SUMMER,

03:33.865 --> 03:35.389
MIKE ACCIDENT.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.395
DR. LAHIRI, I AM LOVING
CHINESE FOOD.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.788
YEAH, I'M HAVING
A GREAT TIME TOO, BETSY.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.486
I DIDN'T MEET A CUTE GUY
OR ANYTHING,

03:45.529 --> 03:49.011
BUT MY HANDYMAN DID GIVE ME
AN EARFUL ABOUT OBAMA.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.447
HEY, YOU'RE MINDY'S FRIEND,
RIGHT?

03:50.491 --> 03:52.014
I'M DANNY.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.320
OH, HEY, I'M ALEX.

03:53.363 --> 03:54.408
ALEX.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.584
THAT'S USUALLY
A GUY'S NAME, RIGHT?

03:56.627 --> 03:58.760
NOT--NO?
NO, IT'S NOT.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.979
I'M--LOOK, I MEAN,
IT FITS YOU.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.198
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE
MANISH OR ANYTHING--

04:02.242 --> 04:03.330
EXCUSE ME?

04:03.373 --> 04:04.287
I THINK THE WORD
DANNY IS SEARCHING FOR

04:04.331 --> 04:06.071
IS STATUESQUE.

04:06.115 --> 04:09.249
WHERE HAS MINDY
BEEN HIDING YOU?

04:09.292 --> 04:11.251
I'M OUT OF THE COUNTRY
A LOT.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.296
WOW, TRAVELING'S
REALLY COOL.IT'S AMERICA'S LOSS.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.428

AND YOU ARE GORGEOUS.

04:17.474 --> 04:21.783

04:21.826 --> 04:23.654
WELL, IT'S NICE
MEETING YOU BOTH.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.526
DOCTORS.
GREAT.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.092
AS A COURTESY, DANNY,
I SHOULD LET YOU KNOW

04:27.136 --> 04:29.225
THAT I'M INTERESTED
IN ALEX,

04:29.269 --> 04:30.966
SO MAYBE BACK OFF.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.489
SO BECAUSE
YOU'RE INTERESTED,

04:32.533 --> 04:34.186
IT MEANS I CAN'T
BE INTERESTED?

04:34.230 --> 04:35.362
NO, YOU CAN
BE INTERESTED.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.841
JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.887
OKAY, WE'LL SEE.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.628
WE WILL SEE.[light slap]

04:40.671 --> 04:42.978

04:43.021 --> 04:45.328
DID THAT HURT?
NO.

04:45.372 --> 04:46.329
[hard slap]
UGH.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.462
DID THAT HURT?

04:48.505 --> 04:49.593
NO.

04:49.637 --> 04:50.551
[Morgan]
I THINK IT'S TIME

04:50.594 --> 04:52.204
FOR THE PRESENTS!

04:52.248 --> 04:53.554
GWEN, GET IT STARTED.

04:53.597 --> 04:56.557
OH, A BOOK.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.299
MICROWAVE COOKING FOR ONE.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.430
OHH.

05:00.474 --> 05:01.823
THAT'S PERFECT FOR YOU.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.041
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO COOK,
AND YOU'RE SINGLE.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.260
THAT'S A GREAT GIFT, GWEN.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.741
WHAT?
WHAT'S THAT LOOK?

05:06.784 --> 05:08.873
OH, MAN,
I WISH I HAD A MICROWAVE.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.919
NOW WE HAVE
PARKER THE INTERN.

05:10.962 --> 05:12.137
OOH-OOH.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.922

05:13.965 --> 05:16.881
A LIFE-SIZE BODY PILLOW
OF A SHIRTLESS CHRIS EVANS.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.535
I SILK-SCREENED IT MYSELF
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING,

05:18.579 --> 05:20.320
"OH, I DON'T EVER HAVE
ANY BOYFRIENDS,

05:20.363 --> 05:21.886
SO NOBODY CAN EVER
CUDDLE ME AT NIGHT."

05:21.930 --> 05:23.192
SO I MADE THIS GUY FOR YOU.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.324
I'M NOT ALWAYS
SAYING THAT.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.368
YEAH, YOU SAY IT, LIKE,

05:25.412 --> 05:26.456
ONCE OR TWICE A DAY
FOR SURE.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.675
WOW, VERY THOUGHTFUL.

05:27.718 --> 05:29.503
I THINK THAT WAS
THE LAST GIFT.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.895
SO THANK YOU, GUYS,
THIS WAS REALLY COOL.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.462
NO, NO, WAIT! HOLD ON, MINDY.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.029
THERE'S ONE MORE
SURPRISE TONIGHT.

05:34.072 --> 05:35.639
BECAUSE WE ALL CARE
ABOUT YOU SO MUCH,

05:35.683 --> 05:39.382
WE DECIDED TO CHIP IN
AND GET YOU ONE LAST PRESENT.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.949
OOH.
SO...

05:40.992 --> 05:43.168
[Mindy]
COME ON,
AN ELLIPTICAL MACHINE?

05:43.212 --> 05:44.387
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT YOU NEVER
HAVE TIME TO GO TO THE GYM,

05:44.431 --> 05:46.084
SO NOW THE GYM
CAN COME TO YOU.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.348
NO MORE EXCUSES,
MISSY!

05:48.391 --> 05:51.655
I THINK I'M GOING
TO CALL IT A NIGHT.

05:51.699 --> 05:54.441
MINDY, NO, YOU CAN'T LEAVE.
EVERYBODY CAME HERE FOR YOU.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.094
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
WANT THEM TO.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.226
OH, BOY.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.401
YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY, DANNY?

05:58.445 --> 05:59.837
IT'S JUST THAT
I ALWAYS TELL YOU

05:59.881 --> 06:01.535
THAT BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS
ARE THE WORST.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.406
WELL, I GUESS YOU WERE RIGHT.
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.190
I DON'T WANT TO BE RIGHT.
I HATE THAT I'M RIGHT.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.322
YOU DO?
YOU HATE IT?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.410
THERE'S NOT, LIKE,

06:07.454 --> 06:08.759
SOME TINY LITTLE PART OF YOU

06:08.803 --> 06:11.240
THAT FEELS, LIKE, REALLY
VINDICATED ABOUT ALL THIS?

06:11.283 --> 06:12.676
A TINY BIT VINDICATED.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.808
MINDY, MINDY.

06:13.851 --> 06:15.157
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP!

06:15.200 --> 06:16.506
YOU'RE GETTING ME
WITH THE ZIPPER!

06:16.550 --> 06:18.334
MINDY, EVERYONE HERE
IS HAVING FUN.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.770
WELL, THEN I APOLOGIZE,

06:19.814 --> 06:21.511
BECAUSE MY IDEA OF FUN

06:21.555 --> 06:22.730
IS NOT RECEIVING
A TON OF GIFTS

06:22.773 --> 06:25.341
THAT REMIND YOU
HOW LAME YOU ARE.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.995
THIS HURTS, GUYS.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.736
IT'S A SAD DAY FOR ME

06:28.779 --> 06:30.128
WHEN THE MOST THOUGHTFUL
PRESENT THAT I RECEIVED

06:30.172 --> 06:33.001
WAS A SWATCH WATCH
FROM MIKE ACCIDENT.

06:33.044 --> 06:35.438
SO THANK YOU, MIKE. THE REST OF YOU,

06:35.482 --> 06:38.485
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.
HAVE A GREAT LIFE.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.355
WHOA, WHOA, DR. "L"![gong sounds]

06:39.399 --> 06:41.226
OW! WHO PUT THAT GONG THERE?

06:45.448 --> 06:47.276
[Mindy]
I LOVE CHAIN RESTAURANTS.

06:47.319 --> 06:50.235
THE BOOTHS ARE DEEP.
THE MENUS ARE COMPREHENSIVE.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.628
DID YOU KNOW
THAT THIS RESTAURANT

06:51.672 --> 06:53.500
HAS ITS OWN FRAMED
BILL OF RIGHTS?

06:53.543 --> 06:54.762
I HAVE THE RIGHT

06:54.805 --> 06:57.199
TO LIFE, LIBERTY,
AND CHICKEN WINGS.

06:57.242 --> 06:58.505
THE WOMEN'S ROOM
SAYS "FOXES."

06:58.548 --> 07:01.246
THE MEN'S ROOM
SAYS "HOUNDS." WHAT?

07:01.290 --> 07:03.031
IT'S SO CREATIVE.

07:03.074 --> 07:05.076
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.
I FEEL AT HOME.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.164
WOW, DON'T LET ME FORGET

07:06.208 --> 07:07.383
TO HAVE YOU FILL OUT

07:33.104 --> 07:35.367
WHERE YOU HAVE TO ASK
FOR A FORK.

A LYRIC IN THE SONG?

07:54.909 --> 07:55.866
"WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS"?

07:55.910 --> 07:57.564

08:25.200 --> 08:27.811

08:34.514 --> 08:36.211
SHE FREQUENTS
WHEN SHE'S FEELING BLUE.

08:36.254 --> 08:37.821
SHE'S ALWAYS
CONFIDING IN ME.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.388
I GUESS
IT'S ONE OF THE CURSES

08:39.431 --> 08:40.868
OF BEING A GOOD LISTENER.

08:40.911 --> 08:44.219
WELL, I GUESS

09:33.398 --> 09:34.965
NO, MY FRIENDS,

09:35.009 --> 09:37.011
THEY JUST USE ME
FOR FREE BIRTH CONTROL,

09:37.054 --> 09:38.969
AND THEY CRITICIZE ME
FOR BEING CHUBBY.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.580

09:40.623 --> 09:42.190
YOU, CHUBBY?

MY OWN FRIENDS CALL ME CHUBBY.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.150
[all]
NO.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.544
THAT IS INACCURATE
AND ALSO OFFENSIVE,

09:48.588 --> 09:50.807
AND IRRESPONSIBLE,
AND ANTI-WOMAN.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.504
THAT'S CRAZY.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.684

BECAUSE HE'S GOT
THAT GREAT HAIR

13:35.292 --> 13:37.817
[Danny groans]OH, MY GOD!

13:37.860 --> 13:39.731
I WONDER WHY
THEY CALL THIS A 40.

13:39.775 --> 13:43.213
'CAUSE IT'S 40 OUNCES
OF MALT LIQUOR, DUMMY.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.825
THAT IS PRETTY DUMB.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.739

13:57.967 --> 14:00.230
ON ACCOUNT OF
MY PERSONALITY STINKS.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.102

14:02.145 --> 14:04.060
OH, YEAH, I TOOK

OH, WELL, DOC, I BETTER
HEAD BACK TO THE CAR,

14:17.987 --> 14:18.770
OH, GOD.

14:18.814 --> 14:21.121
OKAY, SIT DOWN.
SIT DOWN.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.818
THE CAR'S NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.994
BEVERLY, LET ME
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.083
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
ABOUT BEING PROMOTED?

14:27.127 --> 14:28.868
REALLY?

14:28.911 --> 14:31.522
ARE YOU OFFERING ME
MY OLD NURSING GIG?

14:31.566 --> 14:32.828
OH, NO, HELL NO.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.916
NO, YOU WERE A TERRIBLE NURSE.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.004
YOU SHOULD HAVE
YOUR LICENSE REVOKED.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.311
BUT WE'VE BEEN
PRETTY BUSY.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.921
WE COULD USE SOME HELP.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.315
HOW ABOUT
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY?

14:41.358 --> 14:44.057
MAYBE YOU COULD
BURP LESS.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.363
WELL, IT BEATS
BUSSING TABLES.

14:46.407 --> 14:49.062
GONNA MISS THE BOYS
IN THE KITCHEN THOUGH.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.020
BUT NOT THE KNIFE FIGHTS.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.631
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

14:54.981 --> 14:57.070
I'M GONNA CALL THE GUYS,
LET THEM KNOW.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.943
HEY, GUYS!

15:00.987 --> 15:03.903

I GOTTA TURN IT ON FIRST.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.817
[phone beeps]OH, MY GOD.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.384
[man, through megaphone]
CAREFUL, EVERYONE.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.212
A CHILD FELL DOWN A MANHOLE,

15:09.256 --> 15:10.648
BUT HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.[applause]

15:10.692 --> 15:12.520
[Danny]
NOT A CHILD.
FULL-GROWN MAN.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.305
NO, DON'T CLAP.
DON'T CLAP, OKAY?

15:15.349 --> 15:17.394
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO SAY
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE?

15:17.438 --> 15:18.918
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.181
I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS
REALLY SOMETHING TO SEE.

15:21.224 --> 15:22.834
DANNY, WE'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND.

15:22.878 --> 15:23.792
I'M GREAT, ALEX.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.402
THAT A BOY, DANNY.
BE BRAVE.

15:25.446 --> 15:26.316
[Morgan]
THIS IS REALLY
A JOINT EFFORT

15:26.360 --> 15:27.404
BETWEEN
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,

15:27.448 --> 15:28.928
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,
AND MYSELF.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.277
WE ALL REALLY
BANDED TOGETHER

15:30.320 --> 15:32.670
TO SAVE THE LIFE
OF DR. DANIEL CASTELLANO.

15:32.714 --> 15:35.021
NO, DON'T SAY MY NAME
ON TV!

15:35.064 --> 15:36.065
OF STATEN ISLAND.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.240
SINGLE GUY, LADIES.

15:37.284 --> 15:38.720
MORGAN!
[siren whoops]

15:41.592 --> 15:43.464
CHERRY-FLAVORED.
CHERRY-FLAVORED.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.595
OH, MY GOD, DANNY!

15:44.639 --> 15:45.901
I CAN'T BELIEVE--
MOVE, MOVE.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.642
DANNY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU WOULD SACRIFICE

15:47.685 --> 15:49.992
THE USE OF YOUR LEGS TO COME
AND FIND ME ON MY BIRTHDAY.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.168
THAT IS THE MOST AMAZING THING
I HAVE EVER HEARD,

15:52.212 --> 15:53.822
AND EVERYTHING MEAN THAT
YOU HAVE EVER SAID TO ME,

15:53.865 --> 15:55.693
I FORGIVE YOU,
MY SWEET, SWEET FRIEND.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.695
I DON'T CARE
THAT YOU'RE PARALYZED.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.219
I WILL COME,
AND I WILL READ BOOKS TO YOU.

15:59.262 --> 16:00.220
OKAY.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.786
AND, DANNY,
IF THEY TELL YOU

16:01.830 --> 16:03.353
THAT YOU CAN'T
HAVE CHILDREN

16:03.397 --> 16:05.660
BECAUSE YOUR PENIS
DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE,

16:05.703 --> 16:08.576
IF WE'LL GET YOU, LIKE,
A SEX SURROGATE OR SOMETHING,

16:08.619 --> 16:10.491
THEY CAN BRING
YOUR LOINS BACK TO LIFE.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.232
MIND, I--
I REALLY CARE
ABOUT YOU.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.669
OKAY, I FRACTURED
MY ANKLE, MINDY.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.497
SO I'M FINE.
WAIT, WHAT?

16:16.540 --> 16:18.020
HE'S TOTALLY FINE.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.022
SO YOUR--
YOUR PENIS WORKS?

16:20.066 --> 16:21.284
I HOPE SO.

16:21.328 --> 16:24.635
HUH, KIND OF A MISLEADING TEXT,
I WOULD SAY.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.028
WELL, WHAT I BELIEVE
I TEXTED IS

16:26.072 --> 16:29.249
"I AM PARALYZED WITH FEAR
FOR WHAT HAPPENED."

16:29.292 --> 16:31.381
AND THE PENIS THING,
I WAS JUST GUESSING.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.861
I WAS PANICKED.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.254
HEY, GANG, THIS IS NICE.

16:34.297 --> 16:35.516
BEVERLY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:35.559 --> 16:36.560
OW, SHE PINCHED ME.

16:36.604 --> 16:37.953
DON'T BE THEATRICAL, BETSY.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.259
GUYS, I RAN INTO
BEVERLY TONIGHT,

16:39.302 --> 16:43.089
AND SHE KINDA SAVED ME
IN A TOUGH SITUATION.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.047
SHE SAID SOME THINGS THAT MADE
ME FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF,

16:45.091 --> 16:48.007
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO
BE FRIENDS NOW.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.965
[Morgan]
DR. L, YOU WANNA
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF?

16:50.009 --> 16:52.054
LET ME TELL YOU THREE THINGS.
ONE IS PROFESSIONAL.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.142
OKAY.
ONE IS EMOTIONAL.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.057
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.ONE IS PHYSICAL.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.189
NO, I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.755
MORGAN, PLEASE JUST
KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

16:57.799 --> 16:58.930
NEVER TELL ME.
I BEG OF YOU.

17:00.845 --> 17:01.933
MINDY.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.935
FINALLY. HI.

17:03.979 --> 17:07.287
WE WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR GETTING YOU PRESENTS

17:07.330 --> 17:09.854
THAT MAKE YOU SEEM
LIKE A FAT LOSER.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.726
WHICH YOU ARE
OBVIOUSLY NOT.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.989
FOR THE RECORD, I HAVE
NOTHING TO BE SORRY FOR.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.078
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WAS ACTING
LIKE A SPOILED PRINCESS.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.253
MAGGIE!
COME ON!

17:17.297 --> 17:19.429
IT'S TRUE.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

17:19.473 --> 17:20.909
OKAY, OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
SHE'S NOT INCORRECT.

17:20.952 --> 17:21.910
I ACTED LIKE A CHILD,

17:21.953 --> 17:23.520
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE RUN OUT,

17:23.564 --> 17:25.435
AND THE PRESENTS
WEREN'T BAD.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.002
I JUST, I THINK THOSE
ARE THE KIND OF GIFTS

17:27.046 --> 17:29.091
THAT I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET MYSELF.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.571

SOME LATE NIGHT EATS?

17:30.614 --> 17:32.790

17:40.102 --> 17:42.800
FISH FILET, EXTRA, EXTRA
TARTAR SAUCE.

17:42.844 --> 17:43.932
OH, MY GOD, THANK YOU.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.629
YOU GUYS THINK
THIS IS SO DISGUSTING.

17:45.673 --> 17:46.891
NO.
I LOVE IT.

17:46.935 --> 17:47.979
WHO EATS FISH FILET?

17:48.023 --> 17:49.329

17:53.463 --> 17:55.074
MORGAN'S BEEN
LIVE TWEETING, SO...

17:55.117 --> 17:56.988
THAT IS THE MIDWIFE GUY
WHO USED HER FOR HER BOD.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.207
[Alex]
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

17:58.251 --> 17:59.904
DID YOU USE OUR FRIEND
FOR HER BOD?

17:59.948 --> 18:01.297
I'D SAY IT WAS
A MISUNDERSTANDING--

18:01.341 --> 18:02.298
OH, BOO!

18:02.342 --> 18:04.170
GUYS, GUYS, STOP, STOP.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.562
DON'T KEEP WASTING FOOD.

18:05.606 --> 18:06.737
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.609
OKAY, THAT WAS AWESOME.
HE DESERVED THAT.

18:08.652 --> 18:09.653
NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.351
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

18:11.394 --> 18:12.482
ALL OF MY COWORKERS HATE YOU,

18:12.526 --> 18:13.744
AND YOU WERE VERY CLEAR

18:13.788 --> 18:15.964
ABOUT ME NOT BEING
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.705
LOOK, I KNOW SOMETIMES
I CAN COME ACROSS

18:17.748 --> 18:19.750
A LITTLE OVERLY SELF-ASSURED.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.665
EH, ARROGANT,
PRETENTIOUS.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.058
OKAY.
AND PEDANTIC.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.320
ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
YOU'RE RIGHT, OKAY?

18:24.364 --> 18:25.974
DUNCAN THINKS
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO

18:26.017 --> 18:27.758
WITH OUR CHILDHOOD
ACTING CAREER.

18:27.802 --> 18:28.890
WHAT?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.283
I WAS THE KID
WHO STOLE A PACK OF GUM

18:30.326 --> 18:31.936
IN THE FIRST COMMERCIAL
WITH MCGRUFF THE CRIME DOG.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.329
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:33.373 --> 18:34.548
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ME?

18:34.591 --> 18:35.897
YOU WERE TREMBLING ON
THE WAY TO THE DOOR,

18:35.940 --> 18:37.551
'CAUSE YOU COULDN'T TAKE
THE PRESSURE OF STEALING IT.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.292
CAN I TELL YOU, I WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE TREMBLING.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.858
I WAS A VERY ANXIOUS KID.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.164
I USED TO PASS OUT
A LOT ON CAMERA.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.557
AND SO I'VE LEARNED
TO OVERCOMPENSATE

18:43.600 --> 18:44.906
WITH FALSE CONFIDENCE.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.299
ANYWAY,
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.866
THE POINT IS I TREATED YOU
IN A WAY THAT WAS NOT NICE.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.172
TERRIBLY, AWFULLY.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.478
I CRIED EVERY NIGHT.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.828
I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I GOT YOU THIS.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.046
THANK YOU.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.874
WHAT IS THIS,
SOME DONATION IN MY NAME

18:56.918 --> 19:00.095
SO THAT GUANTANAMO INMATES CAN
HAVE SOCCER BALLS OR SOMETHING?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.618
NO, ALTHOUGH THE LIMITS
ON THOSE GUYS' LEISURE TIME

19:01.662 --> 19:02.880
IS A SHOCK
TO THE CONSCIENCE.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.186
UGH.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.145
"DEAR CONSTELLATION

19:47.708 --> 19:49.536
OR DO WE HAVE
TO KILL SOMEONE?

19:49.579 --> 19:50.624
NO, WE'RE COOL.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.278
UH, MY BIRTHDAY GIFT TO YOU

19:52.321 --> 19:54.932
IS ONE OF MY WORLD-FAMOUS
FULL-BODY MASSAGES.

19:54.976 --> 19:56.064
HERE'S A PREVIEW.
LET ME JUST--

19:56.107 --> 19:57.413
I'M OKAY.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.459
WELL, YOU GOT A BIG KNOT.
I CAN ACTUALLY HEAR IT.

19:59.502 --> 20:00.851
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S A KNOT.

20:00.895 --> 20:02.244
HEY, I'M DONE.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.290
AS A DOCTOR,
YOU GET PRIORITY.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.554
THAT'S PRETTY COOL,
RIGHT?

20:07.597 --> 20:08.946
I'VE COME TO PRAY
FOR BABY DANIEL.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.861
THE NEWS SAID

20:10.905 --> 20:12.515
HE FELL IN A MANHOLE.

20:12.559 --> 20:16.345
SO YOUR FRIEND JEREMY
ASKED ME OUT.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.304
THAT'S TERRIFIC.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.522
TURNED HIM DOWN.

20:19.566 --> 20:21.132
I WANT A GUY
WHO WORKS FOR IT,

20:21.176 --> 20:25.049
