WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:04.033
Is there anyone
here with us?

00:08.000 --> 00:11.133
Adam,
something just touched me.

00:11.168 --> 00:13.032
What?

00:13.067 --> 00:14.898
I just see this tall, dark,

00:14.933 --> 00:17.533
just shadow just,
like, standing there.

00:17.568 --> 00:20.133
And they heard somebody
whisper, "Hello."

00:21.500 --> 00:23.166
I walked into that
master bedroom,

00:23.201 --> 00:24.833
and I felt like
I was being watched.

00:25.433 --> 00:27.283
Wait a minute.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.133
I saw something.

00:29.168 --> 00:31.333
My god.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.698
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:36.733 --> 00:39.400
I was only 8
when a paranormal incident

00:39.435 --> 00:41.000
changed my life forever.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.965
Since then,
I've dedicated my time

00:44.000 --> 00:46.852
to solving the most terrifying
hauntings imaginable.

00:47.335 --> 00:48.732
I'm Adam Berry.

00:48.767 --> 00:51.367
More than a decade ago,
an encounter at gettysburg

00:51.402 --> 00:53.617
rocked my beliefs
about the supernatural.

00:53.652 --> 00:55.833
Together,
we uncover the truth

00:55.868 --> 00:57.567
behind
the unexplainable.

00:57.602 --> 00:59.065
My god.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.300
Now we are on
our most important mission yet.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.165
Helping families
overcome their fear,

01:06.200 --> 01:10.567
take back their homes,
and reclaim their lives.

01:11.350 --> 01:12.815
Hey, Adam.

01:12.850 --> 01:15.117
I just got a case in Foxborough,
Massachusetts,

01:15.152 --> 01:16.950
and we need to get
out there right now.

01:21.650 --> 01:23.282
The homeowners,
Holly and Tom,

01:23.317 --> 01:26.517
claim they've had activity
for quite a while.

01:26.552 --> 01:29.717
Even more strange,
the clients' neighbor reports

01:29.752 --> 01:32.572
seeing activity going on in their house
from across the street,

01:35.076 --> 01:39.144
but most importantly, the reason
Tom and Holly called is their kids.

01:40.685 --> 01:43.034
Something happened
in their bedroom,

01:43.069 --> 01:45.383
and it totally
freaked them out.

01:45.418 --> 01:47.582
The activity is increasing.

01:47.617 --> 01:49.083
The family doesn't know
what to do,

01:49.118 --> 01:50.441
and they're terrified.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.579
We need to get out there
and help them.

01:54.017 --> 01:55.450
Here we are.

01:55.485 --> 01:56.883
This is it.

01:59.917 --> 02:02.815
Tell us.
What is going on around here?

02:02.850 --> 02:06.491
We've had a lot of action
throughout all the years

02:06.515 --> 02:07.849
that we've been here.

02:07.850 --> 02:12.583
Yeah. So little bits at a time,
so we've been here since 1999.

02:12.618 --> 02:14.817
So what happened
in this room?

02:17.417 --> 02:19.450
Sitting in the living room,
watching TV,

02:19.485 --> 02:20.915
you can see something.

02:20.950 --> 02:23.002
But it's more down the hall.

02:23.917 --> 02:27.015
And everyone in the family
sees it, has seen it.

02:27.050 --> 02:29.717
I've seen it. Holly has seen it,
and Meghan has seen it.

02:29.752 --> 02:31.717
And Meghan is your daughter?
Yes.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.417
- Yes.
- Okay.

02:34.983 --> 02:38.383
So down here is where we see
a shadow going, you know...

02:38.418 --> 02:39.517
- Coming this way?
- Yes.

02:39.552 --> 02:41.267
How tall, you think?

02:41.302 --> 02:42.948
Probably your height.

02:42.983 --> 02:45.450
Is there any sounds
associated with it...

02:45.485 --> 02:46.648
- No.
- ...like footsteps?

02:46.683 --> 02:48.867
How often do you
see the shadow?

02:48.917 --> 02:50.817
Me personally, I've only
seen it once or twice.

02:50.852 --> 02:53.634
- Okay.
- But we switched my kids' rooms,

02:53.669 --> 02:56.382
and that's when
everything was crazy.

02:56.417 --> 02:59.817
So once you started moving
items around the rooms,

02:59.852 --> 03:01.934
activity started peaking.

03:01.969 --> 03:04.017
- Exactly.
- Okay. Okay.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.517
My neighbor across
the street, Cindy,

03:07.552 --> 03:10.034
sees a shadow figure
in this window here,

03:10.069 --> 03:11.799
in just this window.
Okay.

03:11.834 --> 03:14.834
So she's seen the figure,
and the plant hasn't been here.

03:14.869 --> 03:15.865
- Correct.
- Okay.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.000
Whatever is here seems to roam

03:18.035 --> 03:20.151
the whole main floor
of the house.

03:20.186 --> 03:22.267
It doesn't seem shy
around the family.

03:23.467 --> 03:24.465
So what is this room?

03:24.500 --> 03:27.588
- This is a den and my workout room.
- Right. - Okay.

03:27.601 --> 03:29.501
So when I'm down here,
I feel that, like,

03:29.536 --> 03:31.401
"Somebody is watching me"
type of thing.

03:31.436 --> 03:32.566
Okay.

03:32.601 --> 03:33.799
So I'm always looking
in this direction.

03:33.834 --> 03:35.668
I feel like it's coming
from here in this room

03:35.703 --> 03:37.818
or down that hall
in the back there.

03:37.853 --> 03:39.899
So... and there's
nothing ever there,

03:39.934 --> 03:41.934
and I don't hear anything.
I just feel it.

03:41.969 --> 03:44.401
You know, I get
that weird feeling.

03:44.436 --> 03:46.366
And then what else down here?

03:46.401 --> 03:47.968
My son Matthew's room
is right there.

03:48.003 --> 03:49.233
Okay.

03:49.268 --> 03:50.968
So my daughter, Meghan,
and Matthew are playing a game

03:51.003 --> 03:53.499
sitting on the bed,

03:53.534 --> 03:56.399
and they heard somebody
or something come in

03:56.434 --> 04:00.001
and then whisper, "Hello,"
and they both heard it...

04:00.036 --> 04:02.234
- In there?
- ...In there at the same time,

04:02.269 --> 04:04.068
and they took off upstairs.

04:07.234 --> 04:08.701
So this is Matthew's room.
Yes.

04:08.736 --> 04:09.899
- Okay.
- So at that time

04:09.934 --> 04:11.899
when that happened,
the bed was on this wall.

04:11.934 --> 04:14.634
And so there was nobody outside
on the porch or anything?

04:14.669 --> 04:16.034
Not that we know of,
nothing. Yeah, okay.

04:16.069 --> 04:17.466
- Okay.
- For sure.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.901
Who do you think
is in the house?

04:19.935 --> 04:22.301
I think it could be one
of my parents...

04:22.336 --> 04:23.433
Really? Okay.

04:23.468 --> 04:26.701
...because they both
passed right after.

04:26.736 --> 04:28.668
Right after
you moved in here?

04:28.703 --> 04:29.733
- Yes.
- Okay.

04:29.768 --> 04:32.468
So my mother especially,
my father not so much,

04:32.503 --> 04:35.499
but she passed in 2000.

04:35.534 --> 04:38.201
Has any of the activity
that you've encountered

04:38.236 --> 04:41.552
in the house made you think
it might be your mom?

04:41.587 --> 04:44.868
My mother and I had a falling
out before she passed.

04:44.903 --> 04:45.966
Okay.

04:46.001 --> 04:48.527
So I'm wondering
if it's my mother.

04:48.603 --> 04:50.033
- Okay.
- I'm not quite sure.

04:50.068 --> 04:52.734
Normally Adam and I
wouldn't suspect a family member

04:52.769 --> 04:54.599
to scare their own relative,

04:54.634 --> 04:56.901
but if there's bad blood,
then the activity could be.

04:56.936 --> 04:59.468
Holly's mother reaching out
to resolve things.

04:59.503 --> 05:01.533
My mother was Rosalyn.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.233
That gives us something
to go on tonight,

05:03.268 --> 05:06.395
so we can try to reach out
to them too as we investigate.

05:06.396 --> 05:08.996
Right. I would love to
just know who it is

05:09.036 --> 05:11.434
and if they're
okay with us.

05:14.468 --> 05:17.701
Everyone in this family
has seen the shadow figure,

05:17.736 --> 05:20.233
but lately the activity
has spiked,

05:20.268 --> 05:23.268
and Tom and Holly are worried
about the voice the kids heard.

05:23.303 --> 05:25.118
We're sitting them
down separately

05:25.153 --> 05:26.934
and getting their sides
of the story.

05:29.501 --> 05:31.901
Thanks for meeting
with me today, Matthew.

05:31.936 --> 05:33.533
No problem.

05:33.568 --> 05:38.301
Tell me about your experience
when you guys heard a voice.

05:38.336 --> 05:40.035
Take me through
that whole thing.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.699
So it was
a little while ago.

05:41.734 --> 05:43.790
Me and my sister were
downstairs in my bedroom.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.968
We were playing a game,
sitting on the bed.

05:47.003 --> 05:49.068
We heard something
at the same time.

05:49.103 --> 05:50.433
Okay.

05:50.468 --> 05:53.268
We heard a "Hello," but we
just thought it was my mother,

05:53.303 --> 05:55.566
and we just kept
going with the game,

05:55.601 --> 05:58.934
and we just kept playing,
and then, like, 30 seconds later

05:58.969 --> 06:00.801
probably,
we heard it really loud.

06:00.836 --> 06:02.301
It was in my right ear.

06:02.336 --> 06:03.333
Okay.

06:03.368 --> 06:05.366
So we just bolted
and ran upstairs.

06:05.401 --> 06:07.068
A bunch of stuff
went through my mind,

06:07.103 --> 06:08.952
"What was it?
Did I actually hear it?

06:08.987 --> 06:10.397
Was it a ghost?
Was it stuff like that?"

06:10.432 --> 06:11.822
So...
Okay.

06:11.857 --> 06:13.824
I just don't even like
going down there.

06:13.859 --> 06:16.158
It's really scary,
and it feels like

06:16.193 --> 06:18.422
you're being watched,
like, 24/7.

06:18.457 --> 06:20.857
When you're running up the
stairs, you just kind of bolt up

06:20.892 --> 06:22.290
because you don't want to
look behind you and stuff.

06:22.325 --> 06:23.455
Right.

06:23.490 --> 06:25.689
And, I mean,
do you feel safe?

06:25.724 --> 06:28.557
It just feels like everywhere
in the house is being watched.

06:28.592 --> 06:31.390
Just always feels like you're
being watched by something.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.622
If I'm just looking,
watching TV,

06:33.657 --> 06:36.257
I just see this tall, dark,
just shadow just, like,

06:36.292 --> 06:38.596
standing there halfway in between
the entryway and the living room.

06:38.957 --> 06:41.024
So it's actually just
standing there when you see it?

06:41.059 --> 06:42.590
Yeah.
It's not moving.

06:44.390 --> 06:46.757
It was a male, too.
It was, like, a male body shape.

06:46.792 --> 06:49.074
Okay. So you could see
it looks like a man,

06:49.109 --> 06:51.357
but you heard
a female voice downstairs.

06:51.392 --> 06:52.355
Yeah.

06:52.390 --> 06:54.557
It's interesting
that she sees a male,

06:54.592 --> 06:56.555
but she heard a female voice.

06:56.590 --> 07:00.324
It makes me wonder if we're
dealing with multiple entities.

07:00.359 --> 07:03.155
And how often
does it happen?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.024
Probably three times a week,
happens really often.

07:05.059 --> 07:06.157
Really?

07:11.124 --> 07:13.840
Meghan sees this dark
looming shadow all the time,

07:13.875 --> 07:15.982
and she's constantly,
like, asking her family,

07:16.017 --> 07:18.090
"Do you see it? Do you see it?
Do you see it?"

07:18.125 --> 07:19.557
I mean, no one wants
to look over

07:19.592 --> 07:21.355
and see this dark shadow man

07:21.390 --> 07:23.540
standing in the hallway
staring at them.

07:23.575 --> 07:25.172
That makes the family room,
where she says

07:25.173 --> 07:26.948
she's being watched,
our first priority.

07:31.957 --> 07:34.190
We're using the DVR cameras
to try to pick up

07:34.225 --> 07:36.857
on this dark figure
she sees so often.

07:36.892 --> 07:38.255
- So, Amy...
- Yes?

07:38.290 --> 07:40.090
...I'm going to put
this camera here...

07:40.125 --> 07:41.707
- Let me see.
- ...So that we get...

07:41.742 --> 07:43.333
Because they're
sitting here, right,

07:43.368 --> 07:44.924
and they see that
shadow down there?

07:44.959 --> 07:46.824
- Yeah.
- Cool.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:55.057 --> 07:56.822
So, they sit here.

07:56.857 --> 07:59.190
So these are usually closed,
he said,

07:59.225 --> 08:01.474
and those
are usually closed.

08:01.509 --> 08:03.724
Do you want
to shut them?

08:06.624 --> 08:08.124
Because, I mean,
we automatically assume...

08:08.159 --> 08:10.019
...maybe it's a car.
- Yeah.

08:10.124 --> 08:14.689
Cars go this way.

08:14.724 --> 08:17.122
So the headlights
would go this way

08:17.157 --> 08:20.890
because they point...
The headlights for a second

08:20.925 --> 08:24.289
point at this house
this way.

08:24.324 --> 08:26.590
Yeah. But that doesn't cast
any light

08:26.625 --> 08:28.657
at the back
of that hallway.

08:30.990 --> 08:32.440
Okay. Hold on.

08:32.475 --> 08:33.855
It would be dark.

08:33.890 --> 08:35.089
It would be pitch dark
down there,

08:35.124 --> 08:36.355
and they're, like,
sitting here like this.

08:36.759 --> 08:38.655
Watching TV.

08:38.690 --> 08:41.124
My peripheral, like,
I definitely see that

08:41.159 --> 08:44.508
sitting here,
looking at the TV.

08:44.543 --> 08:47.533
I definitely see
that whole area.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.524
So whatever it is
has got to be...

08:50.559 --> 08:52.624
- Big.
- Yeah.

08:54.024 --> 08:54.989
Hello.

08:55.024 --> 08:59.122
Whoever is in this house,

08:59.157 --> 09:01.390
you can come join us
in this area.

09:01.592 --> 09:03.390
My name is Amy.

09:03.425 --> 09:06.122
I'm Adam.

09:06.157 --> 09:11.157
Holly and Tom invited us
into the home to talk to you.

09:14.890 --> 09:17.324
They know that we can
communicate with you.

09:17.359 --> 09:19.390
So they asked us
to come here.

09:23.490 --> 09:25.324
Um, did you see that?

09:31.857 --> 09:33.890
Um, did you see that?

09:37.457 --> 09:40.890
Right there on the doorframe,
the door, like,

09:40.925 --> 09:42.857
into the master bedroom.

09:46.657 --> 09:49.324
I'm going to show you.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.224
I mean, I would
definitely see that.

09:58.259 --> 10:00.522
Do it again.

10:00.557 --> 10:04.857
Yeah. I mean, it's fast,
but I would definitely see it.

10:04.892 --> 10:06.541
I walked into that
master bedroom,

10:06.576 --> 10:08.190
and I felt like
I was being watched.

10:08.225 --> 10:09.789
- Really?
- 100 percent.

10:09.824 --> 10:11.189
I walked in there,
and I was like,

10:11.224 --> 10:13.657
"There is something
else in this room."

10:13.692 --> 10:15.455
Should we move into there?

10:15.490 --> 10:16.990
Do you feel like
something is in there?

10:17.025 --> 10:18.190
We need to go
in that room.

10:24.524 --> 10:28.890
Whoever is here,
there is a green light

10:28.925 --> 10:32.955
on the end
of the bed here, okay?

10:32.990 --> 10:36.922
You may be able to reach out,
grab onto that,

10:36.957 --> 10:41.857
and that green light will go
from green to yellow to red.

10:41.892 --> 10:45.557
They say that sometimes
when they move things around...

10:45.592 --> 10:48.318
...you get a little agitated.
Does it bother you?

10:50.857 --> 10:54.190
Is there something you
want done to the house

10:54.225 --> 10:55.924
that they haven't done yet?

10:59.424 --> 11:00.857
Let's listen to this.

11:15.490 --> 11:17.057
That's something.

11:21.757 --> 11:23.423
"It does." I mean,
it's two syllables.

11:23.458 --> 11:25.090
It does.
It sounded like, "It does."

11:25.125 --> 11:26.155
Yeah.

11:26.190 --> 11:28.724
That's what I first thought.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.463
- It does. - It does.
It does bother them.

11:33.574 --> 11:36.339
Let's ask
some more questions.

11:36.374 --> 11:40.074
Have you been trying to talk
to Holly and the kids?

11:46.007 --> 11:47.777
They said they heard
you say, "Hello."

11:47.825 --> 11:49.907
Do you remember
saying that to them?

11:57.841 --> 11:59.107
All right.

12:10.207 --> 12:12.139
They're not
talking anymore.

12:12.174 --> 12:17.141
Whoever it is said
it does bother them,

12:17.176 --> 12:19.274
but, like,
anyone can say that.

12:19.309 --> 12:21.239
Yeah.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.207
We need to find out
if it's connected

12:23.242 --> 12:25.374
to this house or the family.

12:30.507 --> 12:31.772
Something is communicating,

12:31.807 --> 12:36.074
but the "It does" EVP
isn't helping us figure out who.

12:36.109 --> 12:38.207
I need to ask Holly
more about her mom

12:38.242 --> 12:40.206
and the previous homeowners.

12:40.241 --> 12:42.652
Now is there anything else in
the house we should know about,

12:43.287 --> 12:45.550
anything with
the former homeowners?

12:45.585 --> 12:50.052
Well, there was one other thing
that is downstairs.

12:50.087 --> 12:51.884
Can you tell me about that?

12:51.919 --> 12:53.919
There is a board in the basement
that was left here

12:53.954 --> 12:55.750
by the previous homeowners.

12:55.785 --> 12:59.185
It's a collage of their
personal pictures and notes

12:59.220 --> 13:00.850
and other stuff
that looks like

13:00.885 --> 13:03.517
it's related to
their life together.

13:03.552 --> 13:07.185
Okay. Yeah. Well, we'll take
a look at that for sure.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.613
So what was your relationship
like with your mom?

13:09.854 --> 13:11.217
It was estranged.

13:11.252 --> 13:14.484
She left the day
I turned 18.

13:14.519 --> 13:16.484
- Really?
- I think that was her plan.

13:16.519 --> 13:19.052
Did you have any inkling
she was going to do that?

13:19.087 --> 13:20.784
No.

13:20.819 --> 13:22.652
And was your mom
a loving mom?

13:22.687 --> 13:24.984
No.

13:25.019 --> 13:25.917
- No?
- No.

13:25.952 --> 13:27.850
- Mnh-mnh?
- Mnh-mnh.

13:27.885 --> 13:30.819
And she was in a car accident
in her 50s...

13:32.119 --> 13:35.585
...and so we never got to
really settle what we had.

13:35.620 --> 13:37.084
Okay.

13:37.119 --> 13:39.985
If there was something that you
wanted to say to your mom,

13:40.020 --> 13:42.217
what would it be?

13:42.252 --> 13:46.819
You know, I feel that she could
have reached out to me,

13:46.854 --> 13:50.619
and the weird thing was
I was ready to forgive

13:50.654 --> 13:52.784
because I was pregnant
with my son

13:52.819 --> 13:56.385
and was going to reach out
to her at Christmas,

13:56.420 --> 13:58.695
but it was December 2nd
when she passed. -.

13:58.752 --> 14:03.185
So if I were to say anything,
I would say to her,

14:03.220 --> 14:04.950
you know, "I forgive."

14:04.985 --> 14:08.585
So I'm hoping that
she knows that.

14:08.620 --> 14:11.284
You are a strong woman.

14:11.319 --> 14:12.785
- Yeah. I think so.
- You know?

14:12.820 --> 14:14.984
Yeah. That's a lot.
I do.

14:15.019 --> 14:17.119
I gave her the right,
proper funeral.

14:17.154 --> 14:18.150
I did the right thing.

14:18.185 --> 14:21.124
When I went to her apartment,
there's a few items that I took,

14:21.587 --> 14:22.984
and I can't move them.

14:23.019 --> 14:24.685
So you can't move them.
What do you mean?

14:24.720 --> 14:29.052
If I do,
then I feel activity.

14:29.087 --> 14:30.517
Really?
What is it?

14:30.552 --> 14:34.419
It's just like a little
diamond pyramid.

14:34.454 --> 14:36.585
Okay.

14:39.819 --> 14:41.863
We found many times
during cases like this,

14:41.954 --> 14:45.352
people don't have
great relationships in life,

14:45.387 --> 14:47.884
but for some reason
after death,

14:47.919 --> 14:49.802
they have a moment
to reflect on that,

14:49.837 --> 14:51.911
but they never got
to actually see

14:51.946 --> 14:53.951
that resolution
come to fruition,

14:53.986 --> 14:56.852
and so they come back,
and they want to make amends,

14:56.887 --> 14:58.817
and they want to make it right.

14:58.852 --> 15:03.952
So I had a very lengthy
conversation with Holly today,

15:03.987 --> 15:05.817
and I learned
a lot about her,

15:05.852 --> 15:10.552
and she had a terrible
relationship with her mother.

15:10.587 --> 15:13.236
There are some things here
of her mom's.

15:13.271 --> 15:15.851
Mainly there is a pyramid
in Meghan's room,

15:15.886 --> 15:22.052
this little glass pyramid that
she refuses to let anybody touch

15:22.087 --> 15:24.419
because she says when
that pyramid gets moved,

15:24.454 --> 15:26.603
activity goes crazy
in the house.

15:26.638 --> 15:28.262
Okay.
So we're going to move it?

15:28.297 --> 15:30.055
- Of course we're going to move it.
- Okay. Great.

15:32.552 --> 15:36.052
All right. So we're going
to do the spirit box, right?

15:36.087 --> 15:38.317
The spirit box scans
radio frequencies

15:38.352 --> 15:41.752
and allows entities
to manipulate those frequencies.

15:43.752 --> 15:45.986
With EVPs, we have to wait
for a playback

15:46.021 --> 15:47.717
to make out any messages.

15:47.752 --> 15:50.284
The spirit box responds
in real-time.

15:50.319 --> 15:53.119
The blindfold and the
noise-canceling headphones

15:53.154 --> 15:55.311
make sure I can't hear
any of Adam's questions.

15:55.419 --> 16:02.052
I'll go into Matt's room because
they heard the voice in there.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.852
Okay. I'm ready.
I'm going.

16:05.252 --> 16:07.486
All right.
Is there anyone here with us?

16:10.952 --> 16:14.086
The kids were playing down
when they heard a voice.

16:17.819 --> 16:20.519
Is Holly's mom here?

16:21.486 --> 16:26.019
Adam,
something just touched me.

16:26.054 --> 16:27.652
What?

16:30.052 --> 16:32.852
Who's touching Amy?

16:34.219 --> 16:36.384
You can't touch Amy.

16:36.419 --> 16:37.451
I don't want you to, okay?

16:37.486 --> 16:39.652
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

16:42.652 --> 16:44.486
Can you tell us
what your name is?

16:46.752 --> 16:47.798
Are you related to Holly?

16:49.547 --> 16:52.852
- Do not... Without...
- We moved that pyramid.

16:56.552 --> 16:58.086
The floor.

17:06.019 --> 17:08.586
We moved that pyramid.

17:10.719 --> 17:14.251
The floor.

17:14.286 --> 17:16.386
Do you want us to put
the pyramid back?

17:18.719 --> 17:20.669
Amy?

17:20.704 --> 17:22.584
What?

17:22.618 --> 17:24.919
So I left that room after
you said you got touched.

17:24.954 --> 17:26.050
I came in here...
Yeah.

17:26.086 --> 17:30.484
...because I wanted
to keep an eye on you.

17:30.519 --> 17:33.585
I kept asking for a name.
I kept asking for a name.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.617
Nothing was matching up
except for you just kept

17:36.652 --> 17:39.452
referencing the floor, like,
the pyramid was on the floor...

17:41.052 --> 17:44.886
...but nothing else
specifically, like,

17:44.921 --> 17:45.984
matched up ever.

17:46.019 --> 17:47.886
It's weird because
we got a response

17:47.921 --> 17:49.317
when we asked about moving it,

17:49.352 --> 17:52.035
but nothing when
we asked about her mom.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.719
I mean, we're not getting
a lot down here.

17:54.754 --> 17:56.553
Let's go back to
the master bedroom

17:56.588 --> 17:58.352
where we got
responses last night.

18:08.919 --> 18:11.217
So, whoever is here,

18:11.252 --> 18:12.501
are you related to anyone
in this house?

18:13.754 --> 18:18.819
Holly thinks you might
be her mom.

18:21.686 --> 18:24.684
You can talk to us.

18:24.719 --> 18:28.086
They gave us full rein of
the house while they're gone.

18:28.121 --> 18:30.852
We are welcome.
We were invited here.

18:53.752 --> 18:55.252
Wait.
Go back.

19:02.286 --> 19:04.219
Did that say "Cindy"?

19:09.252 --> 19:11.752
Yeah. That says "Cindy" so loud.
Yes.

19:11.787 --> 19:13.569
Clear as day.

19:13.604 --> 19:16.849
- Who is Cindy?
- The neighbor.

19:20.386 --> 19:21.986
That is a really
clear EVP.

19:22.021 --> 19:23.453
Yeah. Cindy.

19:23.488 --> 19:24.851
That sounds...

19:24.886 --> 19:26.569
That's the clearest
I've heard it.

19:26.604 --> 19:28.252
Why would Holly's mom
say "Cindy"?

19:28.287 --> 19:30.786
We need to talk to her.

19:37.886 --> 19:39.651
All right.
So, Cindy,

19:39.686 --> 19:41.317
thank you so much
for letting us...

19:41.352 --> 19:44.101
...kind of barge into your house
unexpectedly. - No problem.

19:44.586 --> 19:46.784
We were talking with
Holly across the street,

19:46.819 --> 19:52.152
and Holly has mentioned that you
had some experiences from here.

19:52.187 --> 19:54.986
You've actually seen
someone in the window.

19:55.021 --> 19:57.019
Can you describe that
for us?

19:57.054 --> 19:58.317
Yes.

19:58.352 --> 20:01.419
Actually, the tall thin window
that is straight over

20:01.454 --> 20:03.020
with the little archway on it,

20:03.055 --> 20:04.551
I'd look out,
and it looked like

20:04.586 --> 20:07.152
there was a form
standing in the window.

20:07.187 --> 20:08.417
- Jeez.
- God.

20:08.452 --> 20:10.352
So it just looked
like the outline

20:10.387 --> 20:11.817
of a figure standing there,

20:11.852 --> 20:13.686
like someone was trying to get
someone's attention over there,

20:13.721 --> 20:15.320
and you could tell
they weren't home...

20:15.355 --> 20:17.072
...because the lights
were off, you know. - Okay.

20:17.686 --> 20:19.017
Didn't appear
anybody was there.

20:19.052 --> 20:23.719
The TV wasn't on or anything
like that to create that.

20:23.754 --> 20:25.651
- Well, that's interesting.
- Yeah.

20:25.686 --> 20:27.886
Do you know if
the previous homeowners...?

20:27.921 --> 20:29.017
Yes.

20:29.052 --> 20:30.752
There was actually a couple,
Steve and Pat.

20:30.787 --> 20:33.651
And how long
did you know them?

20:33.686 --> 20:36.686
Probably since the mid '80s
I knew them.

20:36.721 --> 20:38.251
I was in middle school.

20:38.286 --> 20:42.184
They moved in sometime
around there.

20:42.219 --> 20:44.235
We found that board
that's in the basement

20:44.270 --> 20:46.252
with the all the souvenirs
from their trips.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.186
Yeah.
They loved to travel.

20:48.221 --> 20:50.051
They traveled all
over the place.

20:50.086 --> 20:51.919
They must have really been
in love with each other.

20:51.954 --> 20:54.686
They were. Yes.
They very much were.

20:54.721 --> 20:58.251
I would go
and help them out.

20:58.286 --> 21:01.052
A couple years after they were
here, there was an accident,

21:01.087 --> 21:03.217
and Pat ended up
in a wheelchair.

21:03.252 --> 21:05.852
So she had limited mobility,
but she still got around,

21:05.887 --> 21:08.452
and I would go over, and she
would be weeding the garden,

21:08.487 --> 21:10.119
and I would go pull her
out of the mud.

21:10.154 --> 21:13.479
Now it seems like you had
a really special relationship with them.

21:13.721 --> 21:14.751
Yeah.

21:14.786 --> 21:16.769
I have some some things
that belong to Pat

21:16.804 --> 21:18.753
that she had left me
after she passed away.

21:18.788 --> 21:20.084
What did she leave you?

21:20.119 --> 21:23.919
She actually left me
her engagement ring...

21:23.954 --> 21:25.051
Wow.

21:25.086 --> 21:28.419
...a heart pendant
and a pair of stud earrings.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.851
Okay.

21:29.886 --> 21:32.119
Those are very
special things.

21:32.154 --> 21:34.320
Yeah.
She didn't have a daughter.

21:34.355 --> 21:36.255
So she kind of,
I guess, adopted me.

21:36.272 --> 21:38.119
Do you know
how they passed away?

21:38.154 --> 21:40.518
They found
that she had MS.

21:40.553 --> 21:44.819
So that just... it's kind
of stemmed from that,

21:44.854 --> 21:48.753
and he had a recurrence
of the Hodgkins,

21:48.788 --> 21:51.939
but they both passed
away in the house.

21:55.719 --> 21:57.653
There's a lot more
going on in this house

21:57.688 --> 21:59.451
than we originally thought.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.318
The former homeowners,
Pat and Steve,

22:01.353 --> 22:04.551
lived here for years,
but they also died here.

22:04.586 --> 22:09.353
We need to step away and come up
with a new game plan.

22:09.388 --> 22:11.951
So this case
is pretty crazy.

22:11.986 --> 22:14.102
It's different in the sense
that the people

22:14.137 --> 22:16.184
we're dealing with
have been experiencing

22:16.219 --> 22:18.519
this activity in their house
for quite for some time,

22:18.554 --> 22:20.819
and to Holly especially,
she just kind of assumed

22:20.854 --> 22:23.151
it was her mom, because
her mom died

22:23.186 --> 22:25.219
right around the time
they both this house.

22:25.254 --> 22:27.320
So Cindy,
she's seeing activity.

22:27.355 --> 22:29.894
We need to, like, get in that house
and monitor that situation.

22:30.053 --> 22:33.138
I mean, there's a lot
of things going on.

22:33.173 --> 22:37.385
What I think is interesting about this is
we basically have two locations,

22:37.420 --> 22:41.386
but one thing I think we need
to really focus on is the stuff.

22:41.421 --> 22:44.686
I feel like the objects
have something to do with it.

22:44.721 --> 22:47.637
I mean, they have
a large collage of everything

22:47.672 --> 22:50.553
of the previous homeowners
ever did together,

22:50.588 --> 22:52.454
you know,
and then here's Cindy

22:52.489 --> 22:54.285
who has some
of the belongings

22:54.320 --> 22:56.385
of the former owners,
Pat and Steve.

22:56.420 --> 22:58.970
She might not even realize
there could be

22:59.005 --> 23:01.520
some sort of attachment
to what she has,

23:01.555 --> 23:05.318
and I'm betting
that Tom and Holly

23:05.353 --> 23:08.720
have no idea that all these
objects could be involved.

23:08.755 --> 23:09.885
We need to get into
Cindy's house.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.470
Like, we have to get
into Cindy's house

23:11.505 --> 23:13.020
and start monitoring
the other house.

23:13.055 --> 23:15.420
- We need help.
- Right.

23:20.086 --> 23:22.520
We have some friends
named Greg and Dana.

23:22.555 --> 23:24.418
They're perfect for this case.

23:24.453 --> 23:26.985
They have a combined
35 years experience

23:27.020 --> 23:30.486
specializing in haunted objects,
which we have a lot of,

23:30.521 --> 23:32.786
but Greg and Dana
are also skilled

23:32.821 --> 23:34.318
paranormal investigators,

23:34.353 --> 23:37.386
which is good because
now we have two locations

23:37.421 --> 23:39.820
and we can't be
in both places at once.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.985
- What's going on?
- Well, a lot.

23:45.020 --> 23:48.453
Basically what we've got here
is we have two locations.

23:48.488 --> 23:50.286
You know, this place,
there are some objects

23:50.321 --> 23:52.995
that we feel like the former owners
might be very attached to,

23:53.030 --> 23:55.436
and then we brought
some objects from next door

23:55.471 --> 23:57.886
as well that we think
they might be attached to.

23:57.921 --> 24:00.986
So I think our hope
is to maybe split up,

24:01.021 --> 24:03.285
and you guys can stay here

24:03.320 --> 24:04.920
and keep monitoring
these objects

24:04.955 --> 24:06.485
while we go across the street.

24:06.520 --> 24:09.253
Because they say they see
an apparition in this window.

24:09.288 --> 24:11.920
And then, after that,
we can all investigate

24:11.955 --> 24:14.086
together downstairs
for a bit.

24:14.121 --> 24:16.551
Absolutely.

24:16.586 --> 24:18.486
So this is where they have...

24:18.521 --> 24:20.351
They've had activity down here,

24:20.386 --> 24:24.353
but there's also
this amazing board.

24:24.388 --> 24:27.818
I have these objects,

24:27.853 --> 24:30.703
which is a pair
of earrings in here,

24:30.738 --> 24:32.762
the engagement ring
and the necklace.

24:32.797 --> 24:34.786
So you guys can use
these for sure.

24:34.821 --> 24:35.751
Wonderful.

24:35.786 --> 24:37.218
We brought the dark mirror,

24:37.253 --> 24:39.103
which charges up
the energy in a place,

24:39.138 --> 24:41.781
and a lot of manifestations tend to
happen around the mirror itself.

24:41.816 --> 24:43.332
- Yeah. Okay.
- Awesome.

24:47.665 --> 24:50.798
When we investigate a house,
we are in that house.

24:50.833 --> 24:53.932
This is the first time
we've gone to another location

24:53.967 --> 24:56.397
to do a ghost
stakeout on a home.

24:56.432 --> 24:59.365
Hopefully Greg and Dana
investigating around the items

24:59.400 --> 25:01.698
will help stir up
whatever is here,

25:01.733 --> 25:03.097
and we get to try to experience

25:03.132 --> 25:05.698
what Cindy has seen
from across the street.

25:05.733 --> 25:07.763
So from here, I mean,

25:07.798 --> 25:12.963
I see Greg and Dana
walking around.

25:12.998 --> 25:14.632
So you would be able to see...
Yeah. You can -

25:14.667 --> 25:16.230
...you would be able
to see somebody.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.832
I would love to have one of them
walk in front of that window,

25:18.867 --> 25:21.332
and then we could see
what it looks like.

25:21.367 --> 25:24.097
Can one of you guys
walk upstairs

25:24.132 --> 25:26.360
and get in front of that
window that we're looking at?

25:26.395 --> 25:27.455
Do you want me to go,
or do you want...

25:27.490 --> 25:29.655
Dana will go.

25:33.455 --> 25:35.105
All right.
I'm here.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.720
She's in the window now?

25:36.755 --> 25:39.286
Are you in the window
right now?

25:39.321 --> 25:42.253
- I'm in the window.
- There she is.

25:42.288 --> 25:45.589
Can you walk in front of the
window from your left to right?

25:46.090 --> 25:47.455
You got it.

25:52.055 --> 25:54.221
Go back.

25:54.256 --> 25:56.388
And go back.

25:58.921 --> 26:02.220
Okay. I see that.
Mmhmm. Okay.

26:02.255 --> 26:03.488
Do we let her go back
to her investigation?

26:03.523 --> 26:05.020
Yeah.
Let her go.

26:05.055 --> 26:05.988
All right.
You can go back downstairs.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.321
Thanks so much, Dana.

26:07.356 --> 26:09.588
No problem.

26:11.121 --> 26:13.088
Okay.

26:15.255 --> 26:16.255
I'm going to start
with a session.

26:18.822 --> 26:21.155
If there is anyone
in this basement with us,

26:21.190 --> 26:23.489
we'd really appreciate it
if you'd come down

26:23.524 --> 26:25.820
and say, "Hello."

26:25.855 --> 26:28.522
We've heard that you might
not have like that the fact

26:28.557 --> 26:32.289
that this mural was removed,
is that true?

26:34.589 --> 26:35.755
- Play it back.
- Call that good?

26:40.622 --> 26:43.054
I know that Cindy
doesn't see it all the time,

26:43.089 --> 26:46.053
but the reality is we are riling
things up over there right now

26:46.054 --> 26:48.321
because not only have
we been investigating,

26:48.322 --> 26:50.559
but now we just brought
Greg and Dana here.

26:52.189 --> 26:56.355
It literally looks like someone
is standing in that window.

26:56.390 --> 26:57.954
Wait a minute.

26:57.989 --> 27:00.320
Is anybody up there?

27:00.355 --> 27:02.638
If there is anyone in this
basement with us,

27:02.673 --> 27:04.922
we'd really appreciate it
if you'd come down

27:04.957 --> 27:07.189
and say, "Hello."

27:15.189 --> 27:16.455
Put it back.

27:16.490 --> 27:18.089
My god.

27:21.589 --> 27:23.522
Adam and I
normally investigate

27:23.557 --> 27:25.420
a home's activity
from the inside.

27:25.455 --> 27:28.038
It's not often we're
investigating a claim

27:28.073 --> 27:30.564
that spirits can be seen
from another house.

27:30.599 --> 27:33.055
The activity just picked up
on the top floor

27:33.090 --> 27:34.787
the exact time Greg and Dana

27:34.822 --> 27:37.555
starting getting some
responses in the basement.

27:47.289 --> 27:48.589
Put it back.

27:48.624 --> 27:50.989
My god.

27:52.755 --> 27:56.655
It's weird because
it literally looks like someone

27:56.679 --> 27:58.519
is standing in that window.

27:58.543 --> 28:00.521
Is anybody upstairs?

28:00.522 --> 28:02.822
Nope.
No one is up there.

28:02.857 --> 28:04.854
I absolutely, 100 percent,

28:04.889 --> 28:07.189
saw somebody walk
in front of that window.

28:07.224 --> 28:09.255
- That's weird.
- That's very weird.

28:09.290 --> 28:11.289
Okay.
Let's go back over there.

28:13.322 --> 28:17.438
It was a crazy experience
to actually see what Cindy sees.

28:17.473 --> 28:21.555
I really think us being here is
triggering something to come out

28:21.590 --> 28:26.220
and to actually see it
is pretty compelling.

28:26.255 --> 28:31.122
I say distinctly someone move
across the windows upstairs,

28:31.157 --> 28:34.510
and I say distinctly, "
she's still up there, right?"

28:35.024 --> 28:36.489
I'm like, "Wait,
isn't she still up there?"

28:36.524 --> 28:37.789
And that's
when I walkied over,

28:37.824 --> 28:39.323
you are not up here.

28:39.358 --> 28:40.806
- Mnh-mnh.
- No.

28:40.841 --> 28:42.220
So what happened?

28:42.255 --> 28:43.820
I want to play what we got,

28:43.855 --> 28:46.222
and I don't want to
tell you what we heard.

28:58.589 --> 28:59.687
Right there.
Put it back.

28:59.722 --> 29:01.091
- Yeah, put it back.
- Put it back.

29:01.092 --> 29:02.720
It is really quiet.

29:02.916 --> 29:05.869
Let's ask some
more questions.

29:05.904 --> 29:09.629
Are you concerned
that they are

29:09.664 --> 29:13.355
going to destroy
this art piece?

29:16.089 --> 29:20.622
We're trying to figure out
if you have a message.

29:20.657 --> 29:24.320
Is that the case?

29:24.355 --> 29:27.955
Are you okay with the changes
that they've made to the house?

29:31.722 --> 29:33.922
Do the changes bother you?

29:38.789 --> 29:41.455
Let's listen and see
if there's anything.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.922
- My god.
- It sounded like...

29:51.957 --> 29:53.089
What does it say?

29:59.222 --> 30:00.722
No way.
I could hear that. Yeah.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.222
I don't think...
Yeah, they know.

30:16.289 --> 30:19.589
It definitely appears they don't
like when things get moved,

30:19.624 --> 30:22.920
but this "No way" EVP seems like
they're not angry

30:22.955 --> 30:26.355
and trust Holly and Tom
will keep their mural in place.

30:26.390 --> 30:28.420
What do you think
is going on here?

30:28.455 --> 30:30.555
It seems like they're
very ready to talk.

30:30.590 --> 30:32.822
I think what they didn't
have are people

30:32.857 --> 30:35.020
who are listening
very intently before.

30:35.055 --> 30:38.255
All right. Well, thank you,
guys, and we'll... yeah.

30:38.290 --> 30:39.722
We'll let you know
how everything turns out.

30:39.757 --> 30:40.922
Please do.
I can't wait to hear it.

30:40.957 --> 30:42.955
Yes, please.

30:45.822 --> 30:48.789
I think her mom is not here.
I mean...

30:48.824 --> 30:50.254
No. I don't.

30:50.289 --> 30:53.154
I haven't, I mean,
we've gotten nothing.

30:53.189 --> 30:57.089
I just really wanted to give
Holly an answer.

30:57.124 --> 30:59.202
I mean, if Pat and Steve
are here,

30:59.256 --> 31:01.356
then I think we need to get
Cindy over here.

31:01.391 --> 31:03.457
Yeah.
Get more answers.

31:03.492 --> 31:05.488
Yeah.
So let's do that.

31:05.523 --> 31:07.523
Let's just see if she'll come
over and investigate with us.

31:11.589 --> 31:13.554
We got an EVP about
the former homeowners',

31:13.589 --> 31:17.856
Pat and Steve's, travel board,
but that's only one EVP.

31:17.891 --> 31:19.488
Meghan sees
a male shadow figure,

31:19.523 --> 31:21.756
and both the kids
heard a female voice.

31:21.791 --> 31:23.689
Could both Pat
and Steve be here?

31:23.724 --> 31:25.456
Or is someone else here?

31:25.491 --> 31:27.154
We can't rule anything out.

31:27.189 --> 31:28.772
Very early on
in this investigation,

31:28.807 --> 31:30.356
we're getting
responses to Cindy.

31:30.391 --> 31:31.821
We're getting Cindy's name.

31:31.856 --> 31:34.056
So we're going to have to bring
Cindy into this investigation.

31:34.091 --> 31:35.988
We need to see
if whoever is here

31:36.023 --> 31:37.756
is going to react to
when we bring her in.

31:37.791 --> 31:40.223
So let's grab
some equipment.

31:45.956 --> 31:47.085
So let's do this.

31:47.456 --> 31:49.988
What this is, is it's
a proximity sensor.

31:50.023 --> 31:53.223
The proximity sensor gives off
an electromagnetic field

31:53.258 --> 31:55.621
around objects
it's attached to.

31:55.656 --> 31:59.323
If anything that conducts
electricity disturbs that field,

31:59.358 --> 32:01.488
an alarm sounds to let us know.

32:01.523 --> 32:03.823
Literally if I get close it,
this is now a conducter.

32:03.858 --> 32:05.421
So I feel, like...

32:05.456 --> 32:07.523
...if anyone reaches out
to touch it.

32:07.558 --> 32:09.065
Yeah.
The alarm goes off.

32:09.491 --> 32:10.491
It's pretty handy.

32:10.492 --> 32:14.254
I mean, I guess maybe you can
help us figure out if why.

32:14.258 --> 32:16.951
I mean, like, why. Do they like the
changes? Do they like the things?

32:16.986 --> 32:18.055
Question.

32:18.090 --> 32:19.790
How tall was Steve,
would you say?

32:19.825 --> 32:22.188
Was he a tall man?

32:22.223 --> 32:25.657
He was actually probably
around Adam's height.

32:25.692 --> 32:27.322
How tall, you think?

32:27.357 --> 32:29.090
Probably your height.

32:30.623 --> 32:31.542
All right.

32:32.175 --> 32:34.622
I know.

32:34.657 --> 32:37.257
- What?
- You and me out of here.

32:48.657 --> 32:51.073
Hey, Pat, Steve.

32:51.108 --> 32:53.432
It's just me now.

32:53.467 --> 32:55.757
Can you talk to me?

32:58.923 --> 33:00.588
If you talk to into
this recorder down here,

33:00.623 --> 33:06.190
they'll hear you, and then I'll
be able to hear you,

33:06.225 --> 33:08.957
and I promise I'll never,
never ever get rid

33:08.992 --> 33:11.674
of your wonderful gifts to me.

33:12.909 --> 33:15.032
Anything you want to tell me?

33:16.757 --> 33:18.581
All right. Let's go listen
and see what she got.

33:25.257 --> 33:27.490
Okay.

33:43.223 --> 33:44.923
- What was that? My god.
- Wait, wait, wait.

33:44.958 --> 33:46.188
Let it finish.

33:46.223 --> 33:48.290
Something about the bed.

33:57.723 --> 33:59.123
Is it,
"They're on the bed?"

33:59.158 --> 34:00.088
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:00.123 --> 34:01.090
That's,
"They're on the bed."

34:01.125 --> 34:02.057
Yeah.
They're on the bed.

34:02.092 --> 34:03.488
They're on the bed.

34:07.723 --> 34:09.790
Something is touching that.

34:14.290 --> 34:16.054
Something about the bed.

34:16.090 --> 34:17.290
Is it,
"They're on the bed?"

34:17.324 --> 34:18.655
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.389
- That's, "They're on the bed."
- Yeah. They're on the bed.

34:20.425 --> 34:21.855
They're on the bed.

34:26.090 --> 34:27.857
Something is touching that.

34:31.092 --> 34:32.956
Shut your mouth.

34:34.956 --> 34:37.955
Yes. It's on the bed, you guys.
It's funny that...

34:37.989 --> 34:39.590
It's almost like they're
pointing it out to each other.

34:43.223 --> 34:46.723
Who's touching it?
Is it Pat?

34:53.223 --> 34:54.855
Pat.

34:54.889 --> 34:56.590
Pat.
It says Pat.

34:56.625 --> 34:58.255
Yeah.

34:58.290 --> 34:59.990
I kind of want to ask a couple
more things at Steve.

35:00.025 --> 35:01.857
Me, too.

35:04.590 --> 35:08.957
These items that you
gave to Cindy, Pat,

35:08.992 --> 35:12.190
she still holds on to them.

35:12.225 --> 35:14.323
Do you like that?

35:15.690 --> 35:18.657
Anything you want
to tell me?

35:18.692 --> 35:22.322
Happy to listen.

35:22.357 --> 35:25.957
Is there a reason
while you're still here?

35:28.223 --> 35:30.890
Let's listen to the recorder.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.855
It's quiet.

35:52.890 --> 35:54.488
I mean, we know
why they're here.

35:54.523 --> 35:57.006
They're here because
this was their home.

35:57.041 --> 35:59.490
They have a connection
to this neighborhood,

35:59.525 --> 36:01.055
a connection to Cindy.

36:01.090 --> 36:03.257
Does that sound
like them to you?

36:03.292 --> 36:05.657
I believe it's them.

36:07.990 --> 36:09.190
Thank you so much, Cindy.

36:09.225 --> 36:10.855
No. I'm glad.

36:10.890 --> 36:14.123
I'm glad it helped, you know,
bring them out.

36:14.158 --> 36:15.523
It was great
to have you here.

36:15.558 --> 36:16.855
Thank you.

36:16.890 --> 36:18.990
Normally we just wrap
things up for our clients,

36:19.025 --> 36:20.757
but in this case,
we gave Cindy,

36:20.792 --> 36:22.490
a friend of the
former homeowners,

36:22.525 --> 36:23.688
a beautiful message.

36:23.723 --> 36:27.088
Pat and Steve are still here
and remember her.

36:27.123 --> 36:28.757
Now we're going to present
the rest of the evidence

36:28.792 --> 36:31.357
to Tom and Holly.

36:39.157 --> 36:40.623
How are you guys
feeling right now?

36:40.658 --> 36:42.522
What are you thinking?

36:42.557 --> 36:43.790
I really have no idea.

36:43.825 --> 36:45.588
I just want to know.

36:45.623 --> 36:47.757
We definitely... we tried
to reach out to your mom,

36:47.792 --> 36:49.855
and we tried time
and time again.

36:49.890 --> 36:53.557
We just hammered down and just
tried to get her to talk to us.

36:53.592 --> 36:55.655
You know, I really
wanted to get a...

36:55.690 --> 36:58.923
I was just desperate to get
a message from her,

36:58.958 --> 37:02.122
something for you,
and it was just really hard

37:02.157 --> 37:05.423
for me to be done investigating
and just not get anything.

37:05.458 --> 37:08.690
I just don't... I want you to
know that we tried really hard.

37:08.725 --> 37:10.759
- That's okay.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.529
Well, one of the first
things that happened to us,

37:12.892 --> 37:15.124
we settled, you know,
in this living room

37:15.159 --> 37:17.508
because we wanted
to figure out the shadow

37:17.543 --> 37:19.822
that you guys see
at the end of the hallway.

37:19.857 --> 37:23.523
My personal experience, I saw
what appeared to be something

37:23.558 --> 37:25.455
that blocked out
the doorframe.

37:25.490 --> 37:27.322
So we were staring down
at the hallway,

37:27.357 --> 37:29.090
and all of a sudden
this thing was like bloop

37:29.125 --> 37:30.822
and went away
really quickly.

37:30.857 --> 37:32.523
So we keep going,
and we're like, "Okay."

37:32.558 --> 37:34.457
Well,
maybe something is here."

37:34.492 --> 37:36.357
So this was
in your bedroom.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.390
20 seconds.

37:44.823 --> 37:46.355
- It is Cindy.
- Yeah.

37:46.390 --> 37:51.623
That was we decided to bring
Cindy into the investigation.

37:51.658 --> 37:53.557
What was interesting
was when we brought her

37:53.592 --> 37:55.322
into the investigation,

37:55.357 --> 37:57.322
and that's when
they started talking.

37:57.357 --> 38:00.890
Automatically we assumed,
"Okay, we're probably dealing

38:00.925 --> 38:03.574
with Pat and Steve
at this point."

38:03.609 --> 38:06.188
But Meghan sees
the man's shadow.

38:06.223 --> 38:09.390
Well, we asked Cindy,
and we said, you know,

38:09.425 --> 38:10.988
"How tall was Steve?"

38:11.023 --> 38:13.573
And she said, "Steve was about
exactly Adam's height."

38:13.608 --> 38:16.123
Which is the
shadow height that you guys see.

38:16.158 --> 38:17.657
Yeah. And that's what
Meghan described.

38:17.692 --> 38:19.388
She did.

38:19.423 --> 38:24.023
And so the next one
is I ask, you know,

38:24.058 --> 38:25.755
"When they move things around,

38:25.790 --> 38:27.157
does that agitate
you a little bit?"

38:27.192 --> 38:28.390
Okay.

38:34.157 --> 38:36.222
Yeah.

38:36.257 --> 38:37.840
- It does.
- Yes.

38:37.875 --> 38:39.388
- It does.
- It does.

38:39.423 --> 38:41.022
They're just being honest.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.690
Obviously we know Pat and Steve
are really nice people

38:43.725 --> 38:46.922
from everything
we've heard about them,

38:46.957 --> 38:49.890
but I could see them
getting a little nervous

38:49.925 --> 38:52.788
when you start really
changing the house around.

38:52.823 --> 38:55.423
I mean, we see it all the time
when construction happens

38:55.458 --> 38:57.374
or when people
change the scenery

38:57.409 --> 38:59.049
or put walls
where doors were,

38:59.084 --> 39:00.655
that the activity picks up.

39:00.690 --> 39:02.757
It's not necessarily a bad
thing, it's just,

39:02.792 --> 39:04.857
you know, it does...
It confuses them.

39:04.892 --> 39:06.923
- Right.
- It's something that occurs.

39:06.958 --> 39:08.788
I'm going to play
this for you.

39:08.823 --> 39:10.390
They were talking
about the collage.

39:10.425 --> 39:11.422
- The board?
- Yeah.

39:11.457 --> 39:13.923
And he asks,
"Are you concerned that

39:13.958 --> 39:15.190
they're going to destroy this?"

39:21.623 --> 39:23.857
- No way.
- No way.

39:23.892 --> 39:25.055
No way.

39:25.090 --> 39:27.090
Which speaks volumes
to the level of confidence

39:27.125 --> 39:28.488
that they have in you guys.

39:28.523 --> 39:32.188
I mean,
you can hang it back up.

39:32.223 --> 39:33.388
You can do whatever
you want with it.

39:33.423 --> 39:34.557
Obviously you're not
going to get rid of it.

39:34.592 --> 39:37.690
And, I mean, I think
that they know

39:37.725 --> 39:38.790
that you would
never do that.

39:38.825 --> 39:39.955
- Yes.
- You know?

39:39.990 --> 39:42.555
It also confirms that,
you know, even though

39:42.590 --> 39:46.488
they might get a little confused
by the renovations,

39:46.523 --> 39:49.240
that they're not concerned that
you're going to do something

39:49.275 --> 39:51.957
that is going to totally
affect them in a way, you know?

39:51.992 --> 39:53.474
Well,
that's good to know.

39:53.509 --> 39:54.922
I mean,
I think we agree.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.090
We just don't think they want
to go anywhere, you know?

39:57.125 --> 39:59.223
This was... they enjoy it here.
This is their home.

39:59.258 --> 40:00.388
Right.

40:00.423 --> 40:01.690
They're just happy here,
like you're happy here.

40:01.725 --> 40:03.923
- And I want them to be happy.
- Yeah.

40:03.958 --> 40:05.655
In every sense
of the word,

40:05.690 --> 40:07.357
we got a welcoming feeling
from them.

40:07.392 --> 40:10.655
- You did?
- I mean, yes.

40:10.690 --> 40:11.790
There's, like, the moment
where you're like,

40:11.825 --> 40:13.024
"I think somebody
is watching me,"

40:13.059 --> 40:14.724
and that can always
make you uneasy,

40:14.759 --> 40:16.308
but really when think
about who it is,

40:16.343 --> 40:17.822
it's, like, they're just
checking on you.

40:17.857 --> 40:20.690
I think there was some concern
that maybe it would escalate,

40:20.725 --> 40:22.557
especially with the more work
you do in the house

40:22.592 --> 40:23.955
and everything, and it could,

40:23.990 --> 40:25.455
but I think now
that you know who it is,

40:25.490 --> 40:27.723
now you can just call out to
them by name, talk to them...

40:27.758 --> 40:29.155
Right. Right.

40:29.190 --> 40:30.757
...let them know what you're
going to before you do it.

40:30.792 --> 40:31.722
Well, I'm glad that...

40:31.757 --> 40:33.123
It's glad to finally know
who it is.

40:33.158 --> 40:35.157
- Awesome.
- Thank you guys so much.

40:35.192 --> 40:37.122
- Great.
- It's so relieving to know

40:37.157 --> 40:39.390
they're okay with us here.
It is pretty cool.

40:39.425 --> 40:41.623
This is just one of
those cases that, really.

40:41.658 --> 40:43.222
It does have a happy ending.

40:43.257 --> 40:46.357
Holly didn't get a direct
message from her mom,

40:46.392 --> 40:49.088
but she was still given
a sense of peace.

40:49.123 --> 40:52.090
There is a lot of love here,
and the fact that they can make.

40:52.125 --> 40:54.957
Pat and Steve still feel
this welcome in their home

40:54.992 --> 40:57.088
even after they've passed away,

40:57.123 --> 40:59.623
I think too often people want
to get rid of their ghosts,

40:59.658 --> 41:02.123
but once you realize they're
here for the same reasons

41:02.158 --> 41:03.807
you are, you know,
it's amazing.

41:03.842 --> 41:05.457
You don't see that very often.
