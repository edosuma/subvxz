01:57.912 --> 01:59.504
Y'all want me to take the wheel, Hank?

01:59.580 --> 02:02.777
No, no.
It's no problem.

02:02.850 --> 02:07.981
I've driven halfway across the country 
with one hand.

02:08.256 --> 02:09.780
Remember that cracker cop
I told you about?

02:09.857 --> 02:11.381
Yeah.

02:11.459 --> 02:13.222
Son of a bitch rode my ass
for 20 miles,

02:13.294 --> 02:15.421
then tried to take me on the left.

02:15.496 --> 02:17.862
He didn't know, of course,
that I was a cop

02:17.932 --> 02:21.424
and I had a 350 supercharged
under the hood.

02:21.502 --> 02:22.867
I gunned it.

02:22.937 --> 02:26.998
Took that cracker
for the ride of his life.

02:27.275 --> 02:29.641
We were doing 140.

02:29.711 --> 02:32.874
And that's when I saw
that son of a bitch

02:32.947 --> 02:35.745
reach for his blue strobe
and plant it on the dashboard.

02:35.817 --> 02:38.285
I couldn't believe it.
The guy was a cop.

02:38.353 --> 02:40.287
He wanted to bust me.

02:40.355 --> 02:44.451
I pulled over and acted 
like I was shaking in my boots,

02:44.525 --> 02:47.460
and he came swaggering over.

02:47.528 --> 02:53.398
"Well, I guess I led you
into that one, hey, boy?

02:53.468 --> 02:55.663
"But you see, I just knew
you were gonna go for it,

02:55.737 --> 02:58.365
"what with you looking in
your rearview mirror like that.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.964
"I knew you were gonna try and race me.

03:01.042 --> 03:03.533
"Now, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to see

03:03.611 --> 03:06.739
your license and registration, son."

03:06.814 --> 03:08.941
So I pulled out my badge,

03:09.017 --> 03:11.485
and he nearly shit in his pants.

03:11.552 --> 03:13.611
"I ought to run you in,"
I told him,

03:13.688 --> 03:17.715
"for endangering the life
of a homicide detective."

03:17.792 --> 03:20.454
You know,

03:20.528 --> 03:24.328
sometimes I'm really not sure
who's worse,

03:24.399 --> 03:25.991
us cops or the fucking criminals.

03:26.067 --> 03:29.525
<i>Change that 1140 to an 1144, Havenhurst.</i> 

03:29.604 --> 03:30.969
<i>Two cars presently at the scene.</i>

03:31.039 --> 03:34.531
I read you.
What was that address again?

03:34.609 --> 03:38.067
<i>That's 105 Crystal
off Richmond below La Mesa.</i>

03:38.346 --> 03:40.007
<i>You got two cars on the scene.</i>

03:40.081 --> 03:41.776
Okay.
We'll check it out.

03:43.117 --> 03:45.347
What's an 1144?

03:45.420 --> 03:49.481
An 1144 is like somebody's dead.

03:49.557 --> 03:51.320
- Like very much dead.
- Oh, okay.

03:51.392 --> 03:52.950
This is gonna get serious, then.
All right.

04:18.086 --> 04:20.077
Razzle them. Dazzle them.

04:20.154 --> 04:23.089
- Razzle-dazzle them.
- Excuse me.

04:41.742 --> 04:45.075
Hey, McDougal.
Hey, hey, McNamara.

04:45.146 --> 04:47.478
Hey-oh, that's it.

04:47.548 --> 04:50.415
Attack!

04:50.485 --> 04:53.852
Want any more? Any more?

04:58.826 --> 05:02.887
Come here. Come here.
Ah, that's right.

05:02.964 --> 05:06.400
I always knew you were
my eagles in drag.

05:33.528 --> 05:35.519
First cup measures...

05:35.596 --> 05:37.063
94.

05:37.131 --> 05:40.589
94 inches south of the north...

05:40.668 --> 05:42.636
- No. That's north.
- Oh, west.

05:42.703 --> 05:44.170
Correction, west of the east wall.

05:44.238 --> 05:46.035
Second cup measures...

05:46.107 --> 05:48.075
- This was Mrs. McCullum...
- 72.

05:48.142 --> 05:49.609
72 inches south of the north wall.

05:49.677 --> 05:51.736
- Yes?
- This was Mrs. McCullum's cup.

05:51.812 --> 05:53.143
- I see.
- She was sitting right there.

05:53.214 --> 05:54.647
I see, I see.

05:54.715 --> 05:56.478
Third cup is approximately 12 inches

05:56.551 --> 05:57.711
west of the second cup.

05:57.785 --> 05:59.810
We'll talk a little later.

06:02.890 --> 06:05.688
It is noted that the coffee
in all three cups

06:05.760 --> 06:07.193
is still lukewarm.

06:07.261 --> 06:09.456
Time: 7:45.

06:09.530 --> 06:12.590
Gary, did you take a shot
of the cups in here?

06:12.667 --> 06:13.827
Yeah, I got 'em.

06:13.901 --> 06:15.869
Okay.
Take 'em into evidence.

06:15.937 --> 06:17.564
I'll get right on that.

06:40.895 --> 06:44.228
Red matter on the sword...

06:44.298 --> 06:46.630
consistent with that of blood.

06:46.701 --> 06:49.966
Position of what is most certainly 
the murder weapon

06:50.037 --> 06:55.998
tip pointing in a 
north-northwesterly direction.

06:56.077 --> 06:58.136
Approximately...

06:58.212 --> 07:00.737
3 feet from the decedent's right toe.

07:00.815 --> 07:02.874
- Hey, Hank you got a minute?
- Yeah.

07:02.950 --> 07:04.815
This morning when you arrived,

07:04.885 --> 07:07.683
did you see a Caucasian male,
approximately 6'4",

07:07.755 --> 07:09.586
with a coffee cup?

07:09.657 --> 07:12.285
Yeah, he walked right by.
He said something, I think.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.118
Why didn't you arrest him?

07:14.195 --> 07:15.594
Should I have?

07:15.663 --> 07:18.029
Yeah.
That's our suspect.

07:18.099 --> 07:20.158
Oh.
He said something strange.

07:20.234 --> 07:23.567
Yeah, Brad.

07:23.638 --> 07:24.798
He's been quite strange.

07:24.872 --> 07:26.134
Brad who?

07:26.207 --> 07:29.074
Brad McCullum.
He did it. He stabbed her.

07:29.143 --> 07:31.611
Ever since he came back from Peru,

07:31.679 --> 07:33.704
he's been strange.

07:33.781 --> 07:36.306
Well, not so much strange as...

07:36.584 --> 07:38.176
different.

08:11.285 --> 08:13.219
It's the rainy season.

08:22.196 --> 08:25.893
You don't kayak during the rainy season.

08:25.966 --> 08:28.901
Nobody... nobody does it.

08:31.806 --> 08:33.602
That's the challenge.

08:36.644 --> 08:38.043
Well, can we at least go down the river

08:38.111 --> 08:41.878
and check it out?

08:41.948 --> 08:43.313
Yeah?

08:46.954 --> 08:49.354
Hey, stop meditating, okay?
Open your eyes.

08:49.423 --> 08:52.859
Look, this is the river.
This is reality.

08:52.927 --> 08:54.758
Want people to think,

08:54.829 --> 08:58.026
come up with a coherent argument.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.878
We have to do something.

09:18.953 --> 09:21.148
I'm gonna try to talk him out.

09:21.222 --> 09:23.747
Okay, but do it from here;
otherwise, we can't cover you.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.792
I'm positive I've seen him in there 
with a shotgun,

09:25.860 --> 09:28.294
and I heard him holler
something about two hostages.

09:46.447 --> 09:48.142
Mr. McCullum?

09:49.817 --> 09:51.375
Mr. McCullum!

09:53.954 --> 09:55.945
Can we talk a moment?

10:02.797 --> 10:07.257
Mr. McCullum... can we talk, sir?

10:16.076 --> 10:19.239
Mr. McCullum, can we talk a moment?

10:23.184 --> 10:25.049
Would you come outside, please?

10:25.119 --> 10:27.349
No. No! 

10:27.421 --> 10:30.151
You come inside
if you want to talk!

10:34.261 --> 10:35.819
I think I can handle this.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.386
You got to make nice with the guy, 
you know,

10:37.465 --> 10:39.262
like call him compadre or something.

10:39.333 --> 10:40.925
- Compadre?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:41.001 --> 10:44.437
He's Irish, I think,
maybe even Scottish.

10:47.341 --> 10:50.970
Mr. McCullum, may I call you Brad?

10:51.045 --> 10:54.845
You can call me Brad.
You can call me Farouk.

10:54.915 --> 10:59.147
You can call me
any damn thing you like.

10:59.220 --> 11:03.884
Hey! God is here.
He's in the house with me.

11:03.958 --> 11:05.789
But I don't need him anymore.

11:05.860 --> 11:08.124
I don't need God anymore.

11:46.567 --> 11:50.003
Brad, you pestered me for years

11:50.070 --> 11:51.901
to get you this piano.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.372
I got it for you,

11:54.441 --> 11:57.877
and you have never used it.

11:57.945 --> 12:01.244
Then you wanted the drums.

12:01.315 --> 12:04.079
I got them.
And you just sit there.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.513
Mom, you were the one
who tried to persuade me

12:10.591 --> 12:12.388
to want them.

12:27.474 --> 12:29.135
What's going on here?

12:29.209 --> 12:31.177
We're having a problem
with one of the residents.

12:31.245 --> 12:32.542
I've got to go in there.

12:32.613 --> 12:34.410
I've got to get
to the McCullums' house.

12:34.481 --> 12:36.312
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can't let anyone through.

12:36.383 --> 12:38.146
But, Officer, this is Ingrid Gudmundson.

12:38.218 --> 12:39.845
- She's his fiancée.
- Whose fiancée?

12:39.920 --> 12:42.218
Brad McCullum.
The guy in the house.

12:42.289 --> 12:43.950
Brad just called me a half an hour ago.

12:44.024 --> 12:48.461
He sounded very urgent.
Has anything happened to him?

12:48.529 --> 12:52.124
Look, I'm his fiancée.
I think I can help.

12:52.199 --> 12:54.133
- Detective Havenhurst?
- <i>Yes?</i>

12:54.201 --> 12:56.135
<i>Detective, I have a young lady here</i>

12:56.203 --> 12:58.330
<i>who says she's the fiancée
of the suspect.</i>

12:58.405 --> 13:01.033
Don't let her go.
I'll be right over.

13:08.382 --> 13:11.146
I'm Detective Havenhurst.
I'm in charge here, Miss...

13:11.218 --> 13:12.378
Ingrid Gudmundson.

13:15.456 --> 13:17.356
Has something happened to Brad?

13:17.424 --> 13:20.257
Well... what can I say?

13:20.327 --> 13:23.524
Brad is our suspect
in a stabbing that took place

13:23.597 --> 13:25.258
across the street from his house.

13:25.332 --> 13:27.459
He has apparently taken some hostages

13:27.534 --> 13:29.900
and barricaded himself inside.

13:37.378 --> 13:39.608
I don't mean to alarm you,
Miss Gudmundson,

13:39.680 --> 13:42.012
but it's all a little strange.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.312
You see, he's claiming 
his name is Farouk

13:44.385 --> 13:48.151
and shouts about God
and tosses oatmeal at us.

13:48.222 --> 13:50.622
It's all a little confusing.

13:50.691 --> 13:53.091
Can you help us out?

13:54.428 --> 13:56.521
Well...

13:56.597 --> 14:01.364
I... I don't know where to begin.

14:01.435 --> 14:04.529
You see, I've known him
about two years.

14:04.605 --> 14:07.096
We're supposed to get married next month.

14:10.377 --> 14:13.608
You know, when he came back from Peru 
about a year ago,

14:13.681 --> 14:17.014
he would call himself Farouk
once in a while.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.012
He was different after that.

14:21.088 --> 14:25.616
I mean, after the trip to Peru.

14:25.693 --> 14:28.321
Did anything in particular 
happen to him there?

14:28.395 --> 14:30.556
Yes.

14:30.631 --> 14:32.565
I mean... no, not to him.

14:32.633 --> 14:36.501
He was with his friends,
these rafters,

14:36.570 --> 14:39.198
these white-water rafters, and...

14:39.273 --> 14:40.968
he didn't go.

14:41.041 --> 14:44.568
I mean, he didn't participate
in the expedition

14:44.645 --> 14:49.082
because he told me he heard
this inner voice

14:49.149 --> 14:52.050
telling him not to go.

14:52.119 --> 14:54.451
And they were angry with him.

14:54.521 --> 14:58.389
And they went into those rapids, and...

14:58.459 --> 15:00.154
<i>all of them drowned.</i>

15:24.184 --> 15:25.344
Yes!

15:26.420 --> 15:28.047
Yes!

15:29.089 --> 15:30.556
Yes!

15:32.292 --> 15:34.658
Check it out.

15:34.728 --> 15:37.424
It's perfect.
This is our river.

15:37.498 --> 15:39.591
This is where we need to be.

15:43.337 --> 15:45.032
I don't know.

15:45.105 --> 15:47.403
We should go further down
and see how it turns out.

15:56.183 --> 15:57.810
Brad!

15:58.085 --> 16:00.781
Why are you acting so strange?

16:06.627 --> 16:09.187
I'm just looking at the river.

16:48.535 --> 16:51.129
Well, that's our challenge.

17:39.953 --> 17:42.922
I don't like your attitude, Brad.

17:43.190 --> 17:45.215
Are you chickening out or something?

17:48.929 --> 17:50.920
It's as simple as that.

17:51.198 --> 17:53.564
I'm not going rafting down that river.

17:53.634 --> 17:56.159
What do you mean by that?

17:56.236 --> 18:01.196
I mean that I'm not going
to take your vitamin pills.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.412
I mean I'm not going to take
your vitamin pills.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.685
I'm not going to drink your herbal tea.

18:18.759 --> 18:20.488
I'm not going to the sweat lodge

18:20.560 --> 18:22.858
with the 108-year-old Native American

18:22.930 --> 18:27.264
who reads <i>Hustler</i> magazine
and smokes <i>Kool</i> cigarettes.

18:27.334 --> 18:31.361
I'm not going to discover my boundaries.

18:33.373 --> 18:37.935
I am going to stunt my inner growth.

18:38.011 --> 18:40.878
I think I shall become a Muslim.

18:40.948 --> 18:43.644
Call me Farouk.

19:28.295 --> 19:29.694
And he was different after that.

19:29.763 --> 19:31.856
He changed somehow.

19:31.932 --> 19:34.901
He told me he would only follow 
this inner voice,

19:34.968 --> 19:37.493
no matter what.

19:37.571 --> 19:40.438
And you couldn't talk him
into anything after that.

19:42.409 --> 19:44.434
And he spoke about God.

19:44.511 --> 19:47.503
Often.

19:47.581 --> 19:49.606
How he'd seen him.

20:22.983 --> 20:25.315
Brad, darling...

20:25.385 --> 20:27.546
can't you see I'm trying
to straighten the bed?

20:27.621 --> 20:29.748
Forget about the bed.
Listen to this.

20:32.592 --> 20:35.618
My dear children,
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

20:35.695 --> 20:39.426
I'm just so happy for you both.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.865
I'm so glad you two are together.

20:41.935 --> 20:43.766
Here, dears.

20:43.837 --> 20:46.499
I've brought you some brownies
I just baked.

20:49.076 --> 20:52.045
Brad, can't you see that Ingrid

20:52.113 --> 20:53.740
is trying to straighten the bed?

20:56.817 --> 20:59.012
You have to keep your eye on him.

20:59.086 --> 21:00.815
You know how he is.

21:28.349 --> 21:30.010
Can't she ever knock?

21:30.084 --> 21:31.847
You've got to listen to this.

21:31.919 --> 21:34.183
I don't want to listen to that.

21:34.255 --> 21:36.348
You need to listen to me.

21:36.424 --> 21:38.858
You've got to move out of here.

21:38.926 --> 21:41.019
You're too old to have
your mom buying your clothes

21:41.095 --> 21:42.960
and serving you cookies-

21:43.030 --> 21:46.830
Okay, okay.
But she means well. 

21:46.901 --> 21:48.061
Just for the night.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.300
Thank you.

22:27.508 --> 22:29.976
You've got to be patient, you know?

22:30.044 --> 22:31.944
She needs me.

22:32.012 --> 22:36.381
She lost her husband
when I was barely two years old.

22:36.450 --> 22:38.213
Why do you never call him your father?

22:38.285 --> 22:41.277
Because I never knew the man.

22:41.355 --> 22:43.448
Listen to this.

22:45.826 --> 22:49.023
<i>Subject of this song is,
I'm born to preach the gospel,</i>

22:49.096 --> 22:51.360
<i>and I sure do love my job.</i>

22:51.432 --> 22:54.265
<i>I'm born...</i> 

22:54.335 --> 22:56.997
<i>To preach the gospel</i>

22:57.071 --> 22:58.470
<i>I'm born...</i>

22:58.539 --> 22:59.904
This is it!

22:59.974 --> 23:02.408
<i>To preach the gospel</i>

23:02.476 --> 23:04.467
This is what I mean.

23:04.545 --> 23:07.241
It's the real thing.

23:07.314 --> 23:09.077
<i>And I sure do...</i>

23:09.149 --> 23:11.276
I mean...

23:11.352 --> 23:12.910
It's him.

23:15.155 --> 23:18.090
Him who?

23:18.158 --> 23:22.060
Him. Him. 

23:24.131 --> 23:27.965
Him. Him. God.
That's who.

23:28.035 --> 23:29.502
I've seen him. I've seen God.

23:29.570 --> 23:32.403
Ever since I was a child,
I knew he was very close.

23:32.473 --> 23:36.910
Right here in the house.

23:36.977 --> 23:39.172
Where?

23:39.246 --> 23:41.043
In the kitchen.

24:05.039 --> 24:07.200
This is him.

24:07.274 --> 24:09.333
This is... this is God.

24:09.410 --> 24:12.038
This is what he looks like.
See?

24:12.112 --> 24:16.879
This is the face of God.

24:16.951 --> 24:21.320
You see... how kind he is?

24:21.388 --> 24:25.154
Oh! Brad... 

24:25.225 --> 24:31.130
I am so glad to see you
back to low-fat foods.

24:31.198 --> 24:35.430
I didn't think that bacon and eggs 
was doing you any good.

24:35.502 --> 24:37.333
Yes, Mom.

24:37.404 --> 24:41.135
You know, the next day
he wanted to buy me a home?

24:42.676 --> 24:45.110
This is the house.

24:45.179 --> 24:48.376
But I said to him, 
"Brad, this house is not for sale."

24:48.449 --> 24:52.977
So he just moved on
to the next one over there.

24:53.053 --> 24:55.988
Well, then I'm going to buy you this one.

24:56.056 --> 24:57.921
Brad, darling...

24:57.992 --> 25:00.620
I know you mean well,
but I don't want to live here.

25:00.694 --> 25:02.559
It's too close to your mother's house.

25:02.630 --> 25:04.530
Besides, we have to start our own lives.

25:04.598 --> 25:06.065
Well, then I'll buy you this one.

25:06.133 --> 25:08.567
It's further.
See?

25:13.007 --> 25:15.202
I don't know.

25:15.275 --> 25:17.072
How about this one?

25:20.014 --> 25:21.345
No.

25:21.415 --> 25:25.283
Brad, where will you get the money from?

25:25.352 --> 25:28.185
You don't have the money.

25:28.255 --> 25:31.088
I plan to come into some.

25:31.158 --> 25:36.391
Brad, this house isn't for sale either.

25:36.463 --> 25:38.294
So what?

25:43.537 --> 25:45.505
So what?

25:49.443 --> 25:51.104
So what?

25:53.180 --> 25:55.239
So what?

25:55.315 --> 25:58.443
Brad, stop that.

25:58.519 --> 26:03.252
I want you to stop that right-right now.

26:03.323 --> 26:06.656
Wouldn't it be nice
to live on the moon,

26:06.727 --> 26:09.355
with banks of television screens

26:09.430 --> 26:13.127
where we could watch
the Earth transform?

26:13.200 --> 26:15.259
We would live in seclusion.

26:15.335 --> 26:18.327
A honeymoon on the moon.

26:18.405 --> 26:20.236
Brad.

26:44.431 --> 26:47.400
Detective,

26:47.468 --> 26:51.029
why would Brad get up so early,

26:51.105 --> 26:52.436
urge me to come over right away,

26:52.506 --> 26:54.337
and then walk across the street

26:54.408 --> 26:57.502
and attack some neighbors
that he barely knows?

26:57.578 --> 26:59.409
Miss Gudmundson,

26:59.480 --> 27:01.778
I have to inform you...

27:02.049 --> 27:05.450
the suspect did not attack his neighbors.

27:05.519 --> 27:09.615
He stabbed his mother,
and she is dead.

27:13.427 --> 27:15.190
His mother?

27:20.234 --> 27:23.726
Why his mother?

27:23.804 --> 27:26.705
I just... I don't understand.

27:26.774 --> 27:28.765
He loved her so much.

27:34.148 --> 27:36.378
I remember this dinner
we had the other night.

27:38.652 --> 27:40.210
Oh...

27:46.860 --> 27:48.452
Oh, you can do better than this.

27:48.529 --> 27:49.791
- Oh, no, Mom.
- My goodness.

27:49.863 --> 27:51.455
That's okay, I've had...

27:51.532 --> 27:53.830
- Just one tiny, tiny, tiny...
- I'm finished.

27:54.101 --> 27:56.626
- I had two helpings.
- Just one tiny...

27:56.703 --> 27:58.102
Thank you.
It was delicious.

27:58.172 --> 27:59.332
It was.

28:03.443 --> 28:06.207
And there will be 
a little something else.

28:12.886 --> 28:16.344
I hope it's not Jell-O.

28:26.233 --> 28:28.394
Oh, Mom, Jell-O.

28:28.468 --> 28:29.730
It's very nice,

28:29.803 --> 28:32.567
but I just can't eat another thing.

28:32.639 --> 28:34.607
But, Brad, you love Jell-O.

28:36.510 --> 28:38.341
Be a good boy.
It's good for your bones.

28:38.412 --> 28:40.607
No, Mom, please, 
I can't eat another thing, okay?

28:40.681 --> 28:42.444
Besides, this Jell-O looks hideous.

28:42.516 --> 28:45.713
I think I'd better feed it 
to the flamingos.

28:45.786 --> 28:48.448
Oh, come on, Brad.
You don't really mean that.

28:51.458 --> 28:55.656
Mom, I'm sorry.
I was just kidding.

28:55.729 --> 28:57.424
Really, I don't even know
how to tell you

28:57.497 --> 28:59.294
how great I think you are.

28:59.366 --> 29:01.891
You're... you're the greatest mother 
in the world.

29:05.371 --> 29:10.206
Oh... Brad.

29:10.276 --> 29:14.178
I wish your father were alive
to hear you talk this way.

29:14.247 --> 29:17.273
Tonight I'm gonna take my best girls out.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.443
We're gonna go driving
over Coronado Bridge

29:19.519 --> 29:21.350
at over 90 miles an hour.

29:21.421 --> 29:23.082
Brad, you know your driving scares me.

29:23.156 --> 29:24.851
You always drive too fast.

29:24.924 --> 29:27.290
You know, last night
I took Coronado Bridge

29:27.360 --> 29:29.954
at 130 miles an hour.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.224
I wanted to know how it felt
being in <i>Star Wars,</i>

29:32.298 --> 29:35.529
driving through the valley
of the shadow of death.

29:51.551 --> 29:54.179
Would you like some, Mom?

29:54.254 --> 29:55.949
Of course.

30:11.604 --> 30:13.435
Enough?

30:13.506 --> 30:15.406
Almost. Good. 

30:15.475 --> 30:17.500
There you go.

31:05.491 --> 31:08.949
Hey! 
Hey, you guys!

31:09.028 --> 31:14.398
I'd like to order a pizza!

31:14.467 --> 31:16.162
And make sure

31:16.235 --> 31:19.170
you get me some transportation

31:19.238 --> 31:21.502
to Mexico...

31:21.574 --> 31:26.978
large enough for me and my two hostages.

31:27.046 --> 31:28.980
And fast!

31:46.165 --> 31:48.395
So we ordered his pizza.

31:48.468 --> 31:50.163
I got an idea.

31:50.236 --> 31:52.670
What if we laced the pizza
with some sleeping pills?

31:52.939 --> 31:54.668
If we put some hot chilies on it,

31:54.941 --> 31:56.306
he'll never taste it.

31:56.376 --> 31:59.436
Thanks, Fargas,
but it's not gonna work.

31:59.512 --> 32:01.605
You watch too much TV.

32:04.651 --> 32:07.449
So what are we gonna do
about the getaway car?

32:07.520 --> 32:11.217
The classic thing.
Just play for time.

32:11.290 --> 32:15.693
Besides, I'm not convinced
about the hostages.

32:15.962 --> 32:17.930
Who's he got in there anyway?

32:17.997 --> 32:20.363
We checked with the neighbors,
and they're all accounted for,

32:20.433 --> 32:21.695
so I don't know.

32:23.503 --> 32:25.368
There's two guys over there
that want to get in,

32:25.438 --> 32:26.928
one guy with a pizza and another guy

32:27.006 --> 32:28.633
who said he just came up
from Los Angeles.

32:28.708 --> 32:31.176
He said Brad called him this morning.

32:31.244 --> 32:33.235
Is his name Meyers?

32:33.312 --> 32:34.939
Yeah. Lee Meyers.

32:36.182 --> 32:39.049
I know him.

32:39.118 --> 32:42.053
We've all been working
on a play together.

32:49.762 --> 32:52.094
This sword cuts deep.

32:52.165 --> 32:53.598
Straight through the lungs.

32:53.666 --> 32:55.258
And justice is flouted...

32:55.334 --> 32:57.063
And stomped in the ground.

32:57.136 --> 32:58.398
The sword smith of destiny...

32:58.471 --> 33:01.998
Hammers the weapon.

33:02.075 --> 33:05.067
A child is brought to this house 
to avenge.

33:10.616 --> 33:12.641
Stay right there.
Freeze.

33:17.490 --> 33:19.481
Who the fuck 
is gonna deliver this thing?

33:19.559 --> 33:21.550
I'm gonna do it.

33:21.627 --> 33:22.992
Okay.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.224
Your weapon.

33:29.302 --> 33:31.634
- Show him your weapon.
- Okay.

33:31.704 --> 33:33.137
Mr. McCullum, I have...

33:33.206 --> 33:35.197
Mr. McCullum, I have your pizza.

33:38.077 --> 33:40.671
Mr. McCullum!

33:40.747 --> 33:42.772
I have your pizza.

33:44.650 --> 33:47.642
Can you see my gun?

33:50.456 --> 33:52.083
Mr. McCullum!

33:54.594 --> 33:56.357
Can you see my gun?

34:01.267 --> 34:03.201
I'm gonna put my gun down.

34:11.444 --> 34:13.810
- I'm unarmed now.
- Through the garage!

34:14.080 --> 34:17.311
- I'm sorry?
- Through the garage!

34:17.382 --> 34:18.714
Okay.

34:20.753 --> 34:23.483
All right.
I'm unarmed.

34:27.827 --> 34:31.695
I'm walking up now.
Where do you want me to put it?

34:31.764 --> 34:33.664
The center.
The center, right here.

34:33.733 --> 34:36.565
Okay. Okay. 

34:36.636 --> 34:38.797
- Closer!
- I'm putting it down right now.

34:38.871 --> 34:41.704
I'm putting it down.

34:41.774 --> 34:44.174
- Closer!
- Okay.

34:46.312 --> 34:50.304
Back off. Back off! 

34:50.382 --> 34:52.681
Okay. I'm away. 

34:57.790 --> 34:59.758
Okay?

34:59.826 --> 35:02.260
- Go away!
- Okay.

35:05.898 --> 35:08.298
But why don't you let me try?

35:08.367 --> 35:11.734
I'm sure I could walk right in 
and bring him out.

35:11.804 --> 35:13.567
He would listen to me.

35:15.775 --> 35:17.606
He would listen to me.

35:17.677 --> 35:20.475
Why else would he call me
at 6:00 in the morning,

35:20.546 --> 35:22.537
desperately asking for help?

35:22.615 --> 35:25.106
You know I can't allow that, sir.

35:25.184 --> 35:27.448
This is a police matter, Mr. Meyers.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.216
And besides, we have
a hostage situation here,

35:30.289 --> 35:33.383
and the special unit
is running the show.

35:33.459 --> 35:37.418
But I would like to ask you
a few questions, if I might.

35:37.496 --> 35:42.456
Can you tell me what 
the content of that call was?

35:42.535 --> 35:47.302
He was desperate,
begging me to come right away

35:47.373 --> 35:50.365
because something terrible
was going to happen.

35:50.443 --> 35:51.876
He said to me,

35:51.944 --> 35:56.244
"Lee, everything is crystallizing 
into one word:

35:56.315 --> 35:58.249
"'Now,'

35:58.317 --> 36:03.448
capital N, capital O, capital W."

36:03.522 --> 36:06.355
He said he was like a runaway train.

36:06.425 --> 36:10.828
And then he mentioned
something about a sword

36:10.897 --> 36:14.697
which he had used
as a prop in our play.

36:14.767 --> 36:18.464
He killed his mother
with that sword, Lee.

36:18.537 --> 36:20.630
Jesus God.

36:24.810 --> 36:26.710
With that damn thing?

36:29.415 --> 36:32.509
Brad was obsessed with it.

36:32.585 --> 36:36.214
I told him it is too dangerous
for rehearsals.

36:36.289 --> 36:39.850
But he insisted on using it.

36:39.926 --> 36:44.590
I remember when he got it.
I was there.

36:44.664 --> 36:48.534
He made a big fuss
about driving down to his uncle.

36:50.536 --> 36:52.470
<i>He killed his mother?</i>

37:18.731 --> 37:21.564
- Hey.
- Hey, Uncle Ted.

37:21.634 --> 37:22.794
Hey, this is my friend Lee.

37:22.868 --> 37:24.495
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:24.570 --> 37:26.470
You haven't seen the new birds yet, 
have you?

37:26.539 --> 37:27.836
No.

37:27.907 --> 37:31.274
Come on out here 
and let me show you.

37:31.344 --> 37:34.575
You need to be careful, though.
They can be mean.

37:34.647 --> 37:39.550
Think dinosaurs in drag.

37:39.618 --> 37:41.984
Brad, I thought you said
your uncle ran a chicken farm.

37:42.054 --> 37:43.419
Was!

37:43.489 --> 37:45.013
You know, Lee, I think my uncle

37:45.291 --> 37:46.883
bred the largest chicken in the world.

37:46.959 --> 37:49.894
Was.
It was the biggest.

37:49.962 --> 37:51.327
- Oh, my God!
- What?

37:51.397 --> 37:52.796
- What?
- My glasses.

37:52.865 --> 37:54.958
Out of my pocket!

37:55.034 --> 37:57.468
Doug, he got the glasses again.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.299
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's the animal.

37:59.372 --> 38:01.272
That's it. Take it. 

38:09.782 --> 38:12.717
This is disgusting.

38:12.785 --> 38:15.583
Don't you do that again.

38:15.654 --> 38:18.316
Brad, this is disgusting.

38:18.391 --> 38:21.792
Maybe we should get away from the fence.

38:21.861 --> 38:23.795
Good one, Doug.
Good one.

38:23.863 --> 38:26.832
I had this one rooster, Ben,

38:26.899 --> 38:28.366
a behemoth.

38:28.434 --> 38:30.994
This thing weighed 45 pounds.

38:31.070 --> 38:33.732
It was bigger than any damn turkey 
you ever saw.

38:33.806 --> 38:35.637
So you raised him for cockfights.

38:35.708 --> 38:37.608
Fuck no, man.
For meat.

38:37.676 --> 38:40.304
Why pluck 20 when you 
can pluck just one?

38:40.379 --> 38:42.711
- Well, that's true.
- But the beast.

38:42.782 --> 38:44.079
The beast was Willard.

38:44.350 --> 38:45.612
You remember Willard, don't you?

38:45.684 --> 38:47.083
- Oh, yeah.
- He was a monster.

38:47.353 --> 38:49.378
Yeah, they got too large,
too mean, too dangerous.

38:49.455 --> 38:52.447
And could Willard kick.
He was angry.

38:52.525 --> 38:56.689
You see these holes here?
See 'em?

38:56.762 --> 38:58.354
To approach him,

38:58.431 --> 39:01.867
you had to hold this up like a shield.

39:01.934 --> 39:06.530
And damn if he didn't jump up
and kick holes in it.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.505
And when I was down to my last can,

39:08.574 --> 39:10.599
that was it, boy; I'd had enough.

39:10.676 --> 39:14.806
I'll be burning their spurs off 
with a blowtorch.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.848
And where are they now,
these big birds?

39:16.916 --> 39:19.578
Well, after Willard,

39:19.652 --> 39:21.381
they couldn't produce
no more offspring.

39:21.454 --> 39:24.821
I think they got too heavy
to jump the hens.

39:24.890 --> 39:29.759
Uncle Ted, I came about the sword.

39:29.829 --> 39:35.563
Now... what exactly did you say
you needed this sword for?

39:35.634 --> 39:38.068
We need it for a theatrical production.

39:38.137 --> 39:39.627
A what?

39:39.705 --> 39:41.036
Brad, do you mean to tell me

39:41.107 --> 39:43.940
that you're serious
about this acting shit?

39:44.009 --> 39:45.738
Yes.

39:45.811 --> 39:49.076
Only faggots and Negroes with attitude

39:49.148 --> 39:50.638
become actors.

39:50.716 --> 39:52.411
Are you a faggot now?

39:52.485 --> 39:55.716
'Cause you don't look 
like no Negro to me.

39:55.788 --> 39:59.383
Look, Uncle Ted,
you don't understand.

39:59.458 --> 40:02.586
This is serious stuff.
We're doing a Greek play.

40:02.661 --> 40:04.925
It's been around for 2,000 years.

40:04.997 --> 40:06.726
A Greek play.

40:06.799 --> 40:09.632
Well, the only thing that
Greeks know how to play with

40:09.702 --> 40:11.135
is each other's balls.

40:11.203 --> 40:13.569
Is this one of those Souvaki plays

40:13.639 --> 40:15.800
where the guys all get up
and dance with each other

40:15.875 --> 40:19.743
like a bunch of fairies?

40:19.812 --> 40:22.542
There is a Greek guy,
moved in not long ago

40:22.615 --> 40:23.843
right over there.

40:23.916 --> 40:25.975
I had to lock my sheep up at night,

40:26.051 --> 40:27.416
made 'em so nervous.

40:27.486 --> 40:28.953
A Greek play!

40:29.021 --> 40:30.454
Brad, does your mother know

40:30.523 --> 40:33.754
you're mixed up in shit like this?

40:33.826 --> 40:34.986
Brad...

40:35.060 --> 40:38.052
it isn't a Greek sword.

40:38.130 --> 40:41.122
The style is all wrong.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.827
So what?

40:46.672 --> 40:48.196
So what?

40:55.948 --> 40:57.176
So what?

41:06.992 --> 41:10.223
Brad...

41:10.496 --> 41:14.728
it's really not 
the right kind of sword.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.961
You know what the book of Job 
has to say?

41:17.036 --> 41:18.196
About swords?

41:18.270 --> 41:20.966
Fuck, no.
About ostriches.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.237
Job 39:13.

41:24.510 --> 41:26.944
<i>"The wing of the ostrich 
beateth joyously,</i>

41:27.012 --> 41:29.776
<i>"but are her pinions and feathers</i>

41:29.848 --> 41:32.248
<i>"the kindly storks?</i>

41:32.518 --> 41:34.850
"For she leaveth her eggs on the earth

41:34.920 --> 41:37.718
"and warmeth them in the dust.

41:37.790 --> 41:39.257
"When the time cometh,

41:39.525 --> 41:42.016
"she raiseth her wings on high

41:42.094 --> 41:45.222
and scorneth the horse and his rider."

41:57.109 --> 42:00.704
I knew he was quarrelsome and disruptive.

42:00.779 --> 42:04.078
But we had to accept him
the way he was.

42:04.149 --> 42:07.983
At the same time,
he was so talented.

42:08.053 --> 42:10.783
But he did give me problems.

42:12.925 --> 42:14.688
Let me warn you straight out.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.625
These ancient Greeks were not just

42:16.695 --> 42:20.859
a bunch of philosophers and aesthetes 
pussyfooting around.

42:20.933 --> 42:22.662
They were into the real thing.

42:22.735 --> 42:24.669
So as I was saying before,

42:24.737 --> 42:26.967
we're dealing here with a trilogy.

42:27.039 --> 42:30.236
You know that the king
comes home from Troy

42:30.309 --> 42:32.971
only to be killed by his wife.

42:33.045 --> 42:36.242
Then the son returns home to avenge him,

42:36.315 --> 42:38.875
to take his mother's life.

42:38.951 --> 42:41.283
But there's a history to this curse

42:41.353 --> 42:43.082
that weighs on these people.

42:43.155 --> 42:45.885
The killing goes on for generations.

42:45.958 --> 42:49.758
Orestes is just the last link

42:49.828 --> 42:52.319
in a bloody chain.

42:52.598 --> 42:55.590
It all starts with Tantalus,

42:55.668 --> 42:59.069
the one who spends his eternity in hell,

42:59.138 --> 43:01.936
chained to a rock by the gods,

43:02.007 --> 43:05.875
starving for grapes just beyond his reach.

43:05.944 --> 43:09.311
He is the source of our word "tantalize."

43:09.381 --> 43:12.976
He is at the root of our own curse,

43:13.052 --> 43:16.715
lusting for something we want
but we cannot have.

43:16.789 --> 43:20.054
He challenged the gods, this Tantalus.

43:20.125 --> 43:22.650
He wanted to see if they were real.

43:22.728 --> 43:25.595
So he invited them for dinner.

43:25.664 --> 43:27.757
And just as a test,

43:27.833 --> 43:31.963
he served up his son in a stew.

43:32.037 --> 43:33.834
The gods puked up his flesh

43:33.906 --> 43:37.899
so he could still father
more cannibals and killers.

43:37.976 --> 43:39.841
It's like his own son Atreus

43:39.912 --> 43:43.746
who cooked the son
of his brother Thyestes

43:43.816 --> 43:47.718
and then invited him for a feast.

43:47.786 --> 43:52.917
I'm saying, to understand Orestes 
and the curse,

43:52.991 --> 43:55.323
you must feel the whole weight

43:55.394 --> 43:58.363
of this godforsaken Tantalid house,

43:58.430 --> 44:03.129
a dynasty of ruthless kings
and diabolical queens

44:03.202 --> 44:06.763
who eat each other's flesh
and fuck each other's wives...

44:06.839 --> 44:11.037
century after century,
generation after generation.

44:11.110 --> 44:14.876
And only Orestes can lift the curse.

44:14.947 --> 44:18.815
But he has to murder his mother to do it.

44:18.884 --> 44:21.216
So he's damned if he does,

44:21.286 --> 44:23.846
he's damned if he doesn't,

44:23.922 --> 44:25.321
and doubly damned if he wavers.

44:25.391 --> 44:29.657
That's it! That's it. 

44:29.728 --> 44:31.992
Razzle them.

44:32.064 --> 44:33.998
Dazzle them.

44:34.066 --> 44:37.194
Razzle-dazzle them.

44:38.937 --> 44:41.201
I'm the director, Brad.

44:41.273 --> 44:42.831
You do what I tell you.

44:44.843 --> 44:49.246
Lee, some people act a role.
Others play a part.

45:10.202 --> 45:14.263
You know, one thing I could just 
never get out of my mind.

45:14.339 --> 45:17.137
I never understood what he meant.

45:17.209 --> 45:20.303
He clutched his sword,
and he said to me,

45:20.379 --> 45:24.873
"A bird was the largest animal
I ever killed

45:24.950 --> 45:27.942
before I killed my mother."

45:28.020 --> 45:30.386
How long ago was that?

45:30.456 --> 45:32.447
Weeks, maybe a month.

45:32.524 --> 45:35.152
But rehearsals went very well,

45:35.227 --> 45:37.457
especially when Brad had no lines

45:37.529 --> 45:41.829
and the chorus was performing.

45:41.900 --> 45:44.801
You remember?

45:44.870 --> 45:46.030
<i>In position.</i>

45:48.073 --> 45:51.167
In position!

45:51.243 --> 45:53.507
Concentrate.

45:53.779 --> 45:56.247
Concentrate.
Let's go.

45:58.517 --> 46:01.486
Earth breeds many things,
begetting...

46:01.553 --> 46:03.521
Pain, terror...

46:03.789 --> 46:05.848
And horrors of suffering.

46:05.924 --> 46:08.119
And the depths of the sea teem with...

46:08.193 --> 46:09.956
Murderous monsters.

46:10.028 --> 46:14.397
And flaming comets
stab down through the sky

46:14.466 --> 46:17.765
and blast creatures that fly.

46:17.836 --> 46:19.531
And creatures that crawl.

46:19.805 --> 46:23.172
And things more horrid still
like the cradles of storms...

46:23.242 --> 46:27.276
- Cradle of storms.
- Cradle of storms.

46:27.346 --> 46:30.179
But who can describe
the audacity of man

46:30.249 --> 46:32.945
or the daring and passion of women

46:33.018 --> 46:36.784
that stop at nothing
and lead to mortal ruin?

46:36.855 --> 46:39.824
The cruel bitch of female passion

46:39.892 --> 46:43.555
can break apart the yoke 
that joins a pair

46:43.829 --> 46:46.093
and force apart the dark embrace...

46:46.164 --> 46:50.157
Of beasts and man alike.

46:50.235 --> 46:51.793
This sword cuts deep.

46:51.870 --> 46:53.303
Straight through the lungs.

46:53.372 --> 46:54.999
And justice is flouted...

46:55.073 --> 46:56.506
And stomped in the ground.

46:56.575 --> 46:58.133
And the sword smith of destiny...

46:58.210 --> 46:59.507
Hammers the weapon.

47:01.580 --> 47:04.913
A child is brought to this house 
to avenge...

47:04.983 --> 47:09.249
To lift the seeping stain 
of ancient blood.

47:09.321 --> 47:13.155
Brought by her, we shudder to name

47:13.225 --> 47:17.184
the dark, brooding fury.

47:19.164 --> 47:20.563
But there was always trouble

47:20.632 --> 47:22.395
whenever we rehearsed Brad's part.

47:22.467 --> 47:24.958
What was the play about?

47:25.037 --> 47:28.438
About a son killing his mother.

47:43.188 --> 47:44.917
Child...

47:44.990 --> 47:48.289
you have in mind to slay,
and slay your mother.

47:48.360 --> 47:52.524
Oh, no, you slay yourself.
You, not I.

47:52.598 --> 47:56.159
Beware... your mother's 
vengeful hounds from hell.

47:56.234 --> 47:58.930
I must heed my father's,
not spare you.

48:00.606 --> 48:04.235
Did she do it... or did she not?

48:07.279 --> 48:09.440
Bear witness here.

48:09.514 --> 48:11.641
This robe...

48:11.917 --> 48:13.646
she dyed it in the blood

48:13.919 --> 48:15.648
that ran around her lover's sword.

48:15.921 --> 48:17.286
Brad, this isn't a Greek robe.

48:17.356 --> 48:21.952
This spurted stain
has aided time to blur

48:22.027 --> 48:26.430
the many dyes 
that once adorned this robe.

48:26.498 --> 48:29.160
I stand here now, made glad,

48:29.234 --> 48:35.230
made mad with blood,
exalting... wailing.

48:37.542 --> 48:41.638
Hear me, woven web that slew my father.

48:41.713 --> 48:46.412
Stop it, stop it, Brad.
Enough, enough.

48:46.485 --> 48:48.316
You skipped a hundred lines.

48:48.387 --> 48:51.322
It makes more sense this way.

48:51.390 --> 48:53.119
It does.

48:53.191 --> 48:56.683
You're just standing there,
delivering lines.

48:56.962 --> 48:58.224
You're not acting.

48:58.296 --> 49:00.594
And at this point,
I told you to move.

49:00.666 --> 49:03.328
Lee...

49:03.402 --> 49:06.929
I need to say something to you
about basketball.

49:07.005 --> 49:08.939
We all know you were a great player.

49:09.007 --> 49:11.942
No, you see... 
I was a little short for the game,

49:12.010 --> 49:14.604
so I had to become
the classic distance shooter,

49:14.680 --> 49:16.409
a 3-point man.

49:16.481 --> 49:18.108
Now, in one of my games,
it happened.

49:18.183 --> 49:20.549
The ball is passed to me.
I jump; I look.

49:20.619 --> 49:23.179
And in midair, I realize...

49:23.255 --> 49:26.190
I'm shy of midcourt,
some 70 feet from the basket.

49:26.258 --> 49:29.455
And I can't come down,
because if my feet touch,

49:29.528 --> 49:31.325
I'm traveling.

49:31.396 --> 49:35.196
So I have to shoot.

49:35.267 --> 49:37.167
I freeze in midair.

49:37.235 --> 49:41.137
Then everything else around me freezes...

49:41.206 --> 49:42.503
so I shoot.

49:42.574 --> 49:48.012
It was more of a shot-put
than a throw.

49:48.080 --> 49:52.642
And it just swished through.

49:52.718 --> 49:55.380
No. No, it hit the rim... hard.

49:55.454 --> 49:58.719
It kind of rattled in.

49:58.790 --> 50:00.724
That's enough.

50:00.792 --> 50:03.158
That's ridiculous.

50:03.228 --> 50:05.128
But I think I've found it.

50:05.197 --> 50:07.495
What?

50:07.566 --> 50:12.060
I've found the still point.

50:12.137 --> 50:15.698
The unwobbling pivot of the world.

50:21.246 --> 50:23.180
Do you know what I mean?

50:23.248 --> 50:27.446
No.
Can we do it again?

50:27.519 --> 50:29.510
Please?

50:29.588 --> 50:32.148
Chorus, back.

50:32.224 --> 50:34.556
Come on, quick, quick.

50:34.626 --> 50:37.186
Get in position.
Position.

50:37.262 --> 50:38.729
Concentrate.

50:41.533 --> 50:44.127
A Greek play.

50:44.202 --> 50:45.396
Let's go.

50:47.506 --> 50:50.168
Earth breeds many things, begetting...

50:50.242 --> 50:52.107
<i>Pain and terror...</i>

50:52.177 --> 50:54.168
<i>And horrors of suffering.</i>

50:54.246 --> 50:56.146
<i>And the depths of the sea teem with...</i>

50:56.214 --> 50:58.114
<i>Murderous monsters.</i>

50:58.183 --> 51:02.313
<i>And flaming comets stab down 
through the sky</i>

51:02.387 --> 51:05.254
<i>and blasts creatures that fly...</i>

51:05.323 --> 51:07.348
<i>And creatures that crawl...</i>

51:07.425 --> 51:10.121
<i>And things more horrid still,</i>

51:10.195 --> 51:11.526
<i>like the cradle of storms.</i>

51:11.596 --> 51:14.832
- <i>Cradle of storms.</i>
- <i>Cradle of storms.</i>

51:15.100 --> 51:17.830
<i>But who can describe
the audacity of man</i>

51:18.103 --> 51:20.594
<i>or the daring and passion of women</i>

51:20.672 --> 51:23.197
<i>that stop at nothing and lead to...</i>

51:23.275 --> 51:24.674
<i>Mortal ruin?</i>

51:24.743 --> 51:26.108
<i>The cruel bitch...</i>

51:26.178 --> 51:28.572
The rooster! The rider! 

51:28.647 --> 51:32.344
A man on a rooster!
The rider of the Apocalypse!

51:34.252 --> 51:36.311
The rooster. The rider!

51:36.388 --> 51:38.322
The rider of the Apocalypse.

51:38.390 --> 51:40.620
No, not the rider.
It was the horse owner.

51:40.692 --> 51:44.321
It was the goddamn horse owner
wouldn't let me have the horse.

51:44.396 --> 51:48.355
Look, imagine it's
the opposite time of the year.

51:48.433 --> 51:50.731
There's no snow.

51:50.802 --> 51:55.136
And this...
this horse is fully grown.

51:55.207 --> 51:57.869
And this little guy
would be riding this,

51:58.143 --> 52:00.577
<i>the smallest horse in the world.</i>

52:00.645 --> 52:04.206
<i>And then Willard, my rooster,</i>

52:04.282 --> 52:06.113
<i>would be chasing him around</i>

52:06.184 --> 52:09.551
<i>the biggest tree on this planet.</i>

52:24.236 --> 52:25.726
Now, here's the thing.

52:25.804 --> 52:28.637
The rooster would stand taller

52:28.707 --> 52:31.676
than the rider and the horse together.

52:31.743 --> 52:33.506
- God, that sounds fantastic.
- Yeah.

52:33.578 --> 52:35.239
There was gonna be a commercial.

52:35.313 --> 52:37.178
It was gonna make a bunch of money.

52:37.249 --> 52:38.648
It was gonna be great!

52:38.717 --> 52:40.617
A commercial for what?

52:45.223 --> 52:46.918
How should I know?

52:47.192 --> 52:49.524
But it was gonna be great.

53:54.459 --> 53:57.724
<i>Subject of this song is,
I'm born to preach the gospel,</i> 

53:57.796 --> 53:59.889
<i>and I sure do love my job.</i>

55:37.462 --> 55:39.430
Hey, Detective, have a look!

56:04.789 --> 56:07.952
Mr. McCullum, what is this?

56:08.026 --> 56:11.621
It's a flamingo 
that slammed into a tree.

56:11.696 --> 56:12.993
Give it to my mother.

56:18.503 --> 56:19.970
He kept talking about his mother...

56:20.038 --> 56:24.475
Mr. Meyers, please.
Please, it's safer here.

56:24.542 --> 56:27.477
I understand.

56:27.545 --> 56:28.944
He was obsessed with her.

56:31.015 --> 56:33.540
When I'd play his mother

56:33.618 --> 56:36.849
and lay murdered at his feet,

56:36.921 --> 56:40.118
he whispered to me,

56:40.191 --> 56:42.853
"Twitch your feet.

56:42.927 --> 56:47.887
I wanna see my mother's feet
dancing her to heaven."

56:47.966 --> 56:51.424
He disrupted our rehearsals
so many times

56:51.503 --> 56:53.596
that I had to take him
out of the play.

56:53.671 --> 56:57.607
I hated to do it because
he was really so very good.

56:57.675 --> 57:00.940
It was really very sad.

57:01.012 --> 57:02.502
He took it hard.

57:02.580 --> 57:05.105
He just couldn't get it
out of his system.

57:05.183 --> 57:07.617
He just couldn't shake it.

57:07.685 --> 57:09.846
When we took the play to Calgary,

57:09.921 --> 57:11.855
he came all that way
with his mother

57:11.923 --> 57:14.118
just to see the performance.

57:14.192 --> 57:17.184
That was the last time I saw him.

57:17.462 --> 57:19.453
He was with his mother.

57:19.531 --> 57:22.625
He seemed so caring.

57:22.700 --> 57:24.998
And he really was taken with the city.

57:25.069 --> 57:28.061
He was so fascinated by it:

57:28.139 --> 57:30.573
All those glass tubes.

57:55.500 --> 57:57.832
Brad, where are you going?
What are you doing?

58:18.556 --> 58:20.490
Can't you see it, Lee?

58:20.558 --> 58:22.651
This is the tunnel of time.

58:35.573 --> 58:37.097
Wouldn't it make the perfect stage

58:37.175 --> 58:39.268
for a cosmic melodrama?

58:41.145 --> 58:44.876
Like a hound on the trail
of a wounded deer,

58:44.949 --> 58:48.248
we will track him down
by the drip of blood.

58:48.319 --> 58:51.015
I snort, lungs bursting,

58:51.089 --> 58:54.286
from long man-slaughtering toil.

58:54.559 --> 58:58.120
Ranging over every corner of this Earth.

58:58.196 --> 58:59.925
In pursuit...

58:59.998 --> 59:03.957
Without wings, I have flown over oceans.

59:04.035 --> 59:06.560
And now that this man is here...

59:06.638 --> 59:09.106
- Somewhere...
- Cowering...

59:09.173 --> 59:11.971
The scent of human blood

59:12.043 --> 59:14.273
grins wide for me.

59:14.345 --> 59:16.940
- Look!
- Look!

59:17.015 --> 59:19.279
- Look!
- Look everywhere.

59:19.350 --> 59:23.684
Cast your eyes in every direction.

59:23.755 --> 59:26.656
Don't let this mother-killer

59:26.724 --> 59:29.693
get away unscathed.

59:29.761 --> 59:32.821
I now stand here, made glad,

59:32.897 --> 59:34.888
made mad with blood,

59:34.966 --> 59:37.833
exalting, wailing.

59:37.902 --> 59:39.836
I slew her.

59:39.904 --> 59:42.304
I deny no word hereof.

59:42.373 --> 59:46.309
Hear me, woven web that slew my father.

59:46.377 --> 59:49.244
This robe, she dyed it in the blood

59:49.314 --> 59:52.112
that ran around her lover's sword!

59:52.183 --> 59:55.914
Yes, you must tell
the manner of your deed.

59:55.987 --> 59:59.320
Drawn sword in hand,
I lopped her head. 

59:59.390 --> 01:00:03.759
Who, and by craft of who,
did urge you on?

01:00:03.828 --> 01:00:06.228
Fate and necessity made me do it!

01:00:06.297 --> 01:00:09.266
Brad, don't participate.
You're disturbing the play.

01:00:09.334 --> 01:00:11.666
Just be quiet.

01:00:11.736 --> 01:00:15.832
Draw from their killers blood 
to answer blood.

01:01:38.222 --> 01:01:41.885
Brad? Brad.
Brad, let's go.

01:01:51.068 --> 01:01:52.330
Brad, let's go.

01:02:07.485 --> 01:02:10.283
Brad?
Brad. Brad.

01:02:10.354 --> 01:02:12.117
- Yes.
- What is it?

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:14.215
Lee, you don't need
to give me such a close look.

01:02:14.292 --> 01:02:18.160
Okay? Yeah, I admit
I've been crying a lot lately.

01:02:18.229 --> 01:02:20.254
But it's strange.

01:02:20.331 --> 01:02:23.767
The tears only come out 
of my left eye...

01:02:23.835 --> 01:02:26.827
never my right.

01:02:26.904 --> 01:02:28.462
How do you explain that?

01:02:39.217 --> 01:02:42.311
Why is everyone staring at the house?

01:02:44.522 --> 01:02:47.423
Why is the whole world staring at me?

01:02:53.464 --> 01:02:57.025
<i>Why are the mountains staring at me?</i>

01:03:00.037 --> 01:03:03.268
<i>Why do the clouds look down upon me?</i>

01:03:07.211 --> 01:03:11.238
<i>Why are the clouds looking upon me?</i>

01:03:11.315 --> 01:03:14.250
<i>Why is everyone staring at me?</i>

01:03:14.318 --> 01:03:17.378
<i>Why is the whole world staring at me?</i>

01:03:33.604 --> 01:03:37.040
<i>Why is the whole world staring at me?</i>

01:05:27.618 --> 01:05:30.178
All right, team one,
up on the roof.

01:05:30.254 --> 01:05:31.653
Team two, shore up the wall.

01:05:31.722 --> 01:05:34.486
Team three, into that garage.

01:05:34.558 --> 01:05:36.492
Team four, go long, perimeter.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.118
Let's go, fellas.
Move out.

01:06:43.627 --> 01:06:45.754
Lieutenant,

01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:47.224
we have a relative

01:06:47.298 --> 01:06:49.323
and close friend of the suspect here.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.265
I think they can be useful.

01:06:51.335 --> 01:06:53.360
All right.

01:06:53.437 --> 01:06:55.598
Put 'em in the van.
Be there in a minute.

01:07:00.244 --> 01:07:02.075
Joey, keep me posted, okay?

01:07:11.622 --> 01:07:13.283
In the van.
Come on.

01:07:21.532 --> 01:07:24.626
Hi, I'm Lieutenant Brown. Ma'am.

01:07:24.702 --> 01:07:28.035
Look, try not to be...

01:07:28.105 --> 01:07:30.130
too distressed about all this, okay?

01:07:30.207 --> 01:07:32.437
Because right now, 
we're just assessing the situation,

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:34.137
all right?

01:07:34.211 --> 01:07:35.735
Now, I appreciate
if you stay here in the van

01:07:35.813 --> 01:07:37.405
so when I need you,
I know where you are.

01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:39.506
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah.

01:07:39.583 --> 01:07:40.743
All right.
Stay with them?

01:07:52.696 --> 01:07:54.254
Same old thing.

01:07:54.331 --> 01:07:57.129
It rings 30 times,
but he doesn't pick up.

01:07:57.201 --> 01:07:59.362
Let me try to get in there.

01:07:59.436 --> 01:08:01.404
Look, I can offer myself up
as a hostage.

01:08:01.472 --> 01:08:02.632
He can take me in a swap.

01:08:02.706 --> 01:08:04.071
No, you won't.

01:08:04.141 --> 01:08:05.836
I can do it. I can do it.

01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:09.307
It's not protocol.
Look, my show. I run it.

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:11.575
You take orders,
or you get behind the perimeter.

01:08:11.649 --> 01:08:13.116
Is that clear?

01:08:18.322 --> 01:08:20.381
Thank you.

01:08:20.457 --> 01:08:21.617
I'm really sorry.

01:08:21.692 --> 01:08:24.627
How totally inconsiderate of me.

01:08:24.694 --> 01:08:26.492
Neither of you have had 
any coffee. Here.

01:08:26.564 --> 01:08:28.087
Thank you.

01:08:28.165 --> 01:08:33.102
And forgive me
for not thinking of it sooner.

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:35.263
You know, when we were up in Canada,

01:08:35.339 --> 01:08:37.863
I realized that Brad was crying a lot.

01:08:38.142 --> 01:08:39.769
He didn't like to talk about it

01:08:39.844 --> 01:08:42.142
or else made a joke out of it.

01:08:42.212 --> 01:08:44.374
But I remember, one time,

01:08:44.448 --> 01:08:47.747
he turned to me,
a little bit more serious,

01:08:47.818 --> 01:08:49.752
and said,

01:08:49.819 --> 01:08:53.256
"I cried in the laundry room
for four years

01:08:53.323 --> 01:08:56.622
until they renovated it
and used it for something else."

01:08:59.296 --> 01:09:02.356
Yeah, it was only two days ago
that he called me, desperate,

01:09:02.433 --> 01:09:04.731
from Tijuana.

01:09:04.801 --> 01:09:07.327
He was crying, and he was telling me

01:09:07.404 --> 01:09:08.894
about this hotel room he was in

01:09:09.173 --> 01:09:11.767
and how he had placed
prescription glasses

01:09:11.841 --> 01:09:14.868
around the light on his night table.

01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:17.379
I went across the border the next morning 
to pick him up.

01:09:50.346 --> 01:09:52.679
Now...

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:55.344
did you buy all these
prescription glasses?

01:10:03.294 --> 01:10:04.454
What do you mean

01:10:04.528 --> 01:10:05.893
by placing prescription glasses

01:10:05.963 --> 01:10:07.555
like this, Brad?

01:10:12.002 --> 01:10:15.733
This is my way of bringing
heaven to Earth.

01:10:22.746 --> 01:10:23.906
You see...

01:11:47.097 --> 01:11:49.361
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

01:11:51.335 --> 01:11:52.802
Oh, not today, not today.

01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:54.667
But I'll take a card.
It's all right, okay.

01:11:54.738 --> 01:11:56.467
Maybe later. Okay.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.337
Thank you, thank you.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:11:58.409 --> 01:12:00.775
Not today. No, it's okay.
Thank you.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:06.043
<i>As soon as we got back to the States,</i>

01:12:06.116 --> 01:12:08.516
<i>he wanted to go to the naval hospital</i>

01:12:08.585 --> 01:12:11.748
<i>in San Diego.</i>

01:12:11.822 --> 01:12:14.086
<i>I was glad...</i>

01:12:14.358 --> 01:12:17.919
<i>because I thought he wanted treatment 
for his depression.</i>

01:12:17.995 --> 01:12:21.954
There.
You turn up here.

01:12:22.032 --> 01:12:23.863
Turn right.

01:12:23.934 --> 01:12:26.095
But that's...
the naval hospital, Brad.

01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:29.430
I want to go to the naval hospital.

01:12:29.506 --> 01:12:30.666
Right.

01:12:33.777 --> 01:12:34.937
Right here.

01:12:36.747 --> 01:12:38.544
My father died here.

01:12:45.689 --> 01:12:46.849
Sir?

01:12:46.924 --> 01:12:49.825
I would like to visit the sick.

01:12:51.095 --> 01:12:52.858
Sir, who would you like to visit?

01:12:52.930 --> 01:12:56.696
The sick.
The sick in general.

01:13:01.138 --> 01:13:03.538
Oh, the general.

01:13:03.607 --> 01:13:05.074
Well, I'm not certain if he's in.

01:13:05.142 --> 01:13:08.543
Why don't you just park your car 
over there, sir?

01:13:14.051 --> 01:13:15.643
One more time, sir.

01:13:15.719 --> 01:13:19.416
Who do you mean by "the sick"?

01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:21.014
Madame...

01:13:21.091 --> 01:13:24.083
I mean the sick in general.

01:13:24.161 --> 01:13:27.096
Sir, you can't visit
the sick in general.

01:13:27.164 --> 01:13:31.066
Can I at least buy
a pillow for the sick?

01:13:31.135 --> 01:13:32.932
You can inquire at the gift shop 
about the...

01:13:33.003 --> 01:13:35.494
but, sir, please wait one moment

01:13:35.572 --> 01:13:37.870
while I make a call.

01:13:37.941 --> 01:13:39.875
Hello?
It's the front desk.

01:13:39.943 --> 01:13:42.571
No, this man just came.
He's asking about a...

01:13:42.646 --> 01:13:44.477
I don't know.
Just stop him!

01:13:44.548 --> 01:13:46.607
He's asking about the sick
or a pillow, I don't...

01:13:46.683 --> 01:13:49.174
<i>Security, there's a man
going to the gift shop.</i>

01:13:49.453 --> 01:13:51.182
<i>Yes, civilian.
With a woman, right now.</i>

01:13:51.455 --> 01:13:52.945
<i>He's behaving very strange.</i>

01:13:53.023 --> 01:13:55.719
Brad.

01:13:55.792 --> 01:13:57.157
They're calling security.

01:13:59.763 --> 01:14:01.128
Brad!

01:14:06.069 --> 01:14:08.902
Brad, let's... 
let's just go, okay?

01:14:52.115 --> 01:14:55.983
Look how beautiful San Diego is.

01:14:56.053 --> 01:14:58.078
It's like the city of God.

01:15:13.804 --> 01:15:15.738
Do you... mean to leave it here?

01:15:15.806 --> 01:15:18.240
Yeah. I'm hoping 
some young future player

01:15:18.308 --> 01:15:19.969
will find it.

01:15:40.097 --> 01:15:43.863
Did you see that, Ingrid?
The whole world almost stopped.

01:15:48.338 --> 01:15:50.101
What do you mean?

01:15:52.976 --> 01:15:56.173
Brad... I didn't see anything.

01:16:03.854 --> 01:16:06.118
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to give you this.

01:16:06.189 --> 01:16:07.588
Your bag?

01:16:07.658 --> 01:16:09.285
Yes, as a gift.
I insist, please.

01:16:09.359 --> 01:16:11.259
No. What am I supposed to do 
with this bag?

01:16:11.328 --> 01:16:12.761
Just take it.
It's wonderful.

01:16:12.829 --> 01:16:14.729
It's got all kinds of- see?

01:16:14.798 --> 01:16:16.265
Oh, wait, I've got
to keep this one thing,

01:16:16.333 --> 01:16:17.857
but you can have the rest.

01:16:17.934 --> 01:16:19.595
No, you know, I can't.
I don't know.

01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:20.830
Enjoy it. Thank you.

01:16:20.904 --> 01:16:22.269
Okay, uh...

01:16:25.676 --> 01:16:27.940
Brad, all your glasses are in there.

01:16:28.011 --> 01:16:30.206
Oh, it's okay.
I can read without 'em.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.908
I'm just following
this inner voice.

01:16:32.983 --> 01:16:35.918
It feels so good to say good-bye 
to your things.

01:16:39.089 --> 01:16:41.614
And then?

01:16:41.692 --> 01:16:45.150
After Balboa Park,
I brought him home,

01:16:45.228 --> 01:16:46.593
to my place.

01:16:46.663 --> 01:16:49.860
That was yesterday.

01:16:49.933 --> 01:16:51.833
He slept for most of the day,

01:16:51.902 --> 01:16:55.065
and then at night,
he got restless.

01:16:55.138 --> 01:16:58.733
He started talking a lot
about machinery,

01:16:58.809 --> 01:17:02.040
how much he hated it.

01:17:02.112 --> 01:17:04.876
And then he disconnected
all the clocks

01:17:04.948 --> 01:17:08.782
and the refrigerator.

01:17:08.852 --> 01:17:10.820
And then he went outside

01:17:10.887 --> 01:17:13.822
and started banging on his car

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:16.324
so hard that it scared me.

01:17:19.162 --> 01:17:22.393
When he finally came back in,

01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:26.295
he had that pillow with him.

01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:29.032
And he gave me this look

01:17:29.106 --> 01:17:30.630
that I'd never seen before,

01:17:30.707 --> 01:17:34.302
and that's when I got really scared.

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:42.641
I said to him, "Brad, I don't want 
you staying here tonight."

01:17:42.719 --> 01:17:46.086
And he just... he left 
without saying a word.

01:17:52.262 --> 01:17:53.786
Detective, the Roberts woman

01:17:53.864 --> 01:17:55.161
seems to have recovered her speech.

01:17:55.232 --> 01:17:56.699
She says she's feeling much better

01:17:56.767 --> 01:17:58.826
and she can talk to you now, sir.

01:17:58.902 --> 01:18:00.335
I'm coming.

01:18:11.715 --> 01:18:15.310
Miss Roberts, I know
this is difficult for you,

01:18:15.385 --> 01:18:18.877
but could you tell me
how it all started?

01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:21.014
Well, it all seemed so normal.

01:18:21.091 --> 01:18:22.456
It was early in the morning,

01:18:22.726 --> 01:18:25.354
and of course, we were up
having our coffee

01:18:25.429 --> 01:18:29.866
when Brad came across the street
with his mother.

01:18:29.933 --> 01:18:32.458
Actually, she was hurrying ahead,

01:18:32.736 --> 01:18:35.330
and he was following
a few steps behind.

01:18:35.405 --> 01:18:37.339
My mother offered her some coffee

01:18:37.407 --> 01:18:39.807
because she sensed
that Miss McCullum

01:18:39.876 --> 01:18:41.434
wanted to talk to her
about something.

01:18:41.511 --> 01:18:42.978
So she said to me,

01:18:43.046 --> 01:18:44.707
"Why don't you take Brad
out in the back

01:18:44.781 --> 01:18:46.339
and show him your garden?"

01:18:46.416 --> 01:18:48.475
So I took him outside

01:18:48.752 --> 01:18:50.219
and showed him my dried-out flowers

01:18:50.287 --> 01:18:52.278
and all the dust,

01:18:52.355 --> 01:18:53.947
talked to him about the problems

01:18:54.024 --> 01:18:55.992
I was having with water shortage.

01:18:56.059 --> 01:19:01.224
And he seemed to be very interested 
in all of this.

01:19:01.298 --> 01:19:04.893
And then when he tossed
his baseball bat at me,

01:19:04.968 --> 01:19:07.801
I asked him, I said,
"Brad, what are you doing?"

01:19:07.871 --> 01:19:12.171
No, but that was later.
No, let me tell the detective.

01:19:12.242 --> 01:19:13.937
When they were out back,

01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:16.877
my daughter and Brad McCullum,

01:19:16.947 --> 01:19:20.508
Mrs. McCullum leaned in
and whispered to me...

01:19:20.784 --> 01:19:23.480
Brad tried to smother me
with a pillow.

01:19:23.553 --> 01:19:25.020
Oh, no.

01:19:25.088 --> 01:19:27.056
He wasn't kidding.

01:19:31.528 --> 01:19:33.519
I think we should call the police.

01:19:33.797 --> 01:19:36.027
- Oh...
- Now, this has gone far enough.

01:19:36.099 --> 01:19:38.192
We've got... here he comes.

01:19:38.268 --> 01:19:40.964
But I'm calling.

01:19:41.037 --> 01:19:43.471
She's had so much trouble
with this garden

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:46.976
with no rain, you know,
and everything, so...

01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:48.977
Adele, you sit here.

01:19:49.045 --> 01:19:51.275
I want you to sit here.

01:19:51.348 --> 01:19:53.043
Excuse me.

01:19:57.954 --> 01:20:00.787
How about some coffee, Brad?

01:20:00.857 --> 01:20:02.188
I'll pour you a cup of coffee.

01:20:02.259 --> 01:20:04.921
Oh, no.

01:20:04.995 --> 01:20:07.122
No, wait, I...

01:20:07.197 --> 01:20:09.392
I got to go get my cup.

01:20:09.466 --> 01:20:12.367
Can't start the day
without my special coffee cup.

01:20:21.545 --> 01:20:24.378
It took quite a while
till he returned,

01:20:24.447 --> 01:20:27.814
about ten minutes or so.

01:20:27.884 --> 01:20:30.250
We almost thought
he wasn't coming back.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:34.120
We were discussing whether or not 
we should call the police

01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:36.159
when he walks in
with his coffee cup.

01:20:54.010 --> 01:20:55.500
Mmm, boy, Mrs. Roberts,

01:20:55.579 --> 01:20:57.945
you sure do make
the best coffee around.

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:11.089
Where's he going?

01:21:16.199 --> 01:21:18.258
He's going to his car.

01:21:21.004 --> 01:21:22.995
He's got a bat.

01:21:48.298 --> 01:21:51.893
Here. Take it.

01:21:51.968 --> 01:21:53.663
- Brad, what are you doing?
- Hit me.

01:21:53.937 --> 01:21:55.165
What?

01:21:55.238 --> 01:21:58.401
Kill me before it happens.

01:21:58.475 --> 01:22:00.409
Kill me before it happens!

01:22:00.477 --> 01:22:01.637
Kill me.

01:22:01.711 --> 01:22:03.076
What are you doing?

01:22:03.146 --> 01:22:04.670
Kill me!

01:22:16.393 --> 01:22:18.657
When he ran her through 
the first time...

01:22:18.728 --> 01:22:22.095
Ran her through?
What do you mean?

01:22:22.165 --> 01:22:24.360
When he ran her through
with the sword,

01:22:24.434 --> 01:22:28.097
she said calmly,
"My son, my son,

01:22:28.171 --> 01:22:30.139
what have ye done?"

01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:32.697
That was the last time
she ever spoke.

01:22:32.976 --> 01:22:34.944
There was no screaming.

01:22:35.011 --> 01:22:40.950
In fact, no one screamed,
least of all his mother.

01:22:41.017 --> 01:22:45.113
I was astounded at the silence.

01:23:01.337 --> 01:23:03.168
Okay. 
We're gonna give this a try.

01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:05.571
You ready?

01:23:05.642 --> 01:23:08.509
You stay behind here,
and no heroics.

01:23:10.213 --> 01:23:11.578
Brad!

01:23:11.648 --> 01:23:14.617
It's me, Lee.

01:23:14.684 --> 01:23:17.118
I came down from L.A.

01:23:17.187 --> 01:23:19.519
Ingrid here is with me.

01:23:19.589 --> 01:23:22.114
I'm here, Brad!

01:23:22.192 --> 01:23:26.253
Brad, it's going to be all right.

01:23:26.329 --> 01:23:27.762
I promise you,

01:23:28.031 --> 01:23:30.522
nothing's going to happen to you.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:35.037
But you have to come out, Brad.

01:23:35.105 --> 01:23:40.133
Brad, it makes no sense
keeping the hostages.

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:42.440
Let them go!

01:23:42.512 --> 01:23:44.639
Yeah!

01:23:44.714 --> 01:23:48.150
In a minute, Lee.
I'm still feeding them.

01:23:53.056 --> 01:23:57.015
Brad, it's me.

01:23:57.093 --> 01:23:59.755
Talk to me.

01:23:59.829 --> 01:24:04.061
Tell me, who are the hostages?
What are their names?

01:24:04.134 --> 01:24:08.571
McNamara and McDougal!

01:24:08.638 --> 01:24:11.732
Oh, my God!

01:24:11.808 --> 01:24:14.675
They're his flamingoes!

01:24:14.744 --> 01:24:16.109
They're his birds!

01:24:16.179 --> 01:24:18.170
What do you mean by birds?

01:24:18.248 --> 01:24:20.478
They're my eagles in drag.

01:24:23.586 --> 01:24:26.180
It's okay. It's okay.

01:24:26.256 --> 01:24:29.191
Come on.
That's all right.

01:24:29.259 --> 01:24:32.319
I hate it that the sun
always comes up in the east.

01:24:32.395 --> 01:24:34.659
Police! Don't move!

01:24:34.731 --> 01:24:36.756
Put your hands in the air!

01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:38.528
Turn around and face the wall!

01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:42.663
Put the weapon down slowly.

01:24:46.242 --> 01:24:48.369
Now, walk,

01:24:48.444 --> 01:24:51.379
walk back towards my voice.

01:24:51.447 --> 01:24:54.541
Keep coming. Keep coming.

01:24:54.617 --> 01:24:58.678
Slow down. Keep coming.

01:24:58.755 --> 01:25:02.213
Stop there. 
On your knees.

01:25:02.292 --> 01:25:04.317
Hands on your head.

01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:18.534
I want to be left in the desert, 
in the wild.

01:25:18.608 --> 01:25:21.304
I want to be taken 
south of the border.

01:25:21.377 --> 01:25:25.507
I have taken a new vocation
as a righteous merchant!

01:25:31.187 --> 01:25:33.212
Hi, Ingrid. Hi, Lee.

01:25:33.289 --> 01:25:35.621
Sorry, folks, I can't allow
communication with the suspect. 

01:25:35.692 --> 01:25:36.852
Please step back.

01:25:36.926 --> 01:25:38.723
Detective, do me a favor.

01:25:38.795 --> 01:25:41.127
Can you include two things
in your report?

01:25:41.197 --> 01:25:44.530
One, forget about flamingoes.
I see ostriches.

01:25:44.601 --> 01:25:47.536
I see ostriches running.

01:26:04.888 --> 01:26:06.617
And two...

01:26:06.689 --> 01:26:09.157
what ever happened to my basketball?

01:26:10.305 --> 01:26:16.587
