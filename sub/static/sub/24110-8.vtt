00:01.697 --> 00:03.394
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

00:03.438 --> 00:05.179
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

00:05.222 --> 00:07.964
When I left the agency
and started teaching,

00:08.008 --> 00:09.357
I became Professor Reinhart.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.923
I wrote a book
about abnormal behavior

00:10.967 --> 00:13.404
and criminals,
which was so successful

00:13.448 --> 00:16.364
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.757
That's when the New York Police Department reached out to me

00:18.801 --> 00:21.717
to help catch him,
which I did. So they hired me

00:21.760 --> 00:23.197
and I became
Consultant Reinhart.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.155
So now I'm working with
this woman,

00:25.199 --> 00:27.853
Detective Lizzie Needham
of the homicide division,

00:27.897 --> 00:29.072
catching killers.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.987
Looks like I need a new name.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.684
Don't they call you
Professor Psychopath?

00:38.125 --> 00:43.304

Ah, I forgot Harry's dish.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.592
Go on ahead.

01:10.635 --> 01:11.593
Bye, Miss Rameen.Bye, Miss Rameen.

Just make sure you call him
"Your Honor," all right?

01:57.682 --> 01:58.901
Okay, thanks.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.120
Hey.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.034
Oh.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.211
What is that,
a Glencallan face I see?

02:04.254 --> 02:05.516
Double, please. Neat.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.778
So what's up?

02:06.822 --> 02:08.215
Don't tell me
Joan's still pushing

02:08.258 --> 02:11.000
that ridiculous deadline
for your first chapter. Mm.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.915
Tailor can't fix the snag
in your Brunello Cucinelli?

02:12.958 --> 02:14.438
My father called.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.007
He wants me to join him
for a hunting trip this weekend.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.270
And you need to tell me
that you don't want to go,

02:20.314 --> 02:23.012
but you can't say no
to your dad, so I'll say

02:23.055 --> 02:24.274
what a great guy
he is, and tell you

02:24.318 --> 02:25.710
you should go, and
you'll start packing.

02:25.754 --> 02:28.670
It's slightly more
egosyntonic than that.

02:28.713 --> 02:30.367
You know, you have
a real filthy mouth.

02:30.411 --> 02:33.153
I actually want to go.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.981
You know, it's hunting, the one
thing my father and I share.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.157
WAITER:
Double, neat.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.593
Thank you.Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.377
Was it
"mitigating circumstances"?

02:40.421 --> 02:42.031
I can't read
my own writing.

02:42.074 --> 02:43.815
Exactly. Try that on the judge.

02:43.859 --> 02:45.034
Thanks, Andy.

02:45.077 --> 02:45.904
I owe you one.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.993
Enjoy.

02:48.037 --> 02:51.083
So you can take the lawyer
out of his white shoes, but...

02:51.127 --> 02:54.174
Well, it was mostly a wardrobe
issue I had with practicing law.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.219
You know, the soul-crushing part
was secondary.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.569
Are you deflecting?I'm deflecting, you're
deflecting off your dad,

02:58.613 --> 02:59.962
who, by the way,

03:00.005 --> 03:01.224
I actually like.Of course youlike him.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.008
You're both charming
sports fanatics

03:03.052 --> 03:04.445
who make a mean martini.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.273
Thankfully, that's
where the resemblance ends,

03:06.316 --> 03:08.231
and you're not
an egomaniacal powermonger.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.014
Not yet.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.843
You know, you don't
have to go with him.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.497
You're busy with a new job.

03:13.541 --> 03:16.370
Maybe, uh, maybe you don't need
your dad in your head right now.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.154
He's not.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.244
But hunting is the one way
I can spend time with my father

03:21.288 --> 03:23.507
where I'm not his target.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.251
JASMINE:
There was a shooting

03:28.295 --> 03:29.644
outside the youth center
in Astoria.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.211
You'll be on special assignment.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.691
It's not yet a homicide,
but the victim is likely.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.824
Meaning l

03:35.867 --> 03:37.260
Just learning the lingo.

03:37.304 --> 03:38.827
If you're pulling us into this

03:38.870 --> 03:40.307
because it's my rookie beat,

03:40.350 --> 03:42.047
I hear the neighborhood's
changed.
No.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.267
It's the mayor who wants
her shiny new toy on this case.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.835
"Shiny New Toy"
just might stick.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.272
But why is the mayor involved?

03:49.316 --> 03:51.492
She fears it's a powder keg that
could blow up the entire city.

03:51.535 --> 03:55.757
The victim's name
is Rameen Nasjami,

03:55.800 --> 03:57.541
the director
of the youth center.

03:57.585 --> 04:00.414
This photo...

04:00.457 --> 04:03.286
was taken by her mother
earlier yesterday.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.332
Her headscarf
wasn't found at the scene.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.290
Missing hijab.
Was this a hate crime?

04:07.334 --> 04:09.292
That's what the mayor
needs to know.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.033
The hate crime squad
wasn't assigned,

04:11.076 --> 04:15.124
but overnight
the Twitterverse exploded.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.344
Conspiracy buffs on one extreme

04:17.387 --> 04:18.519
are accusing us of bias.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.172
LIZZIE: "When the
shooter's Muslim,

04:20.216 --> 04:22.349
they jump to terrorist. When
the victim's Muslim, they..."

04:22.392 --> 04:23.741
And let me guess, the
other side is screaming

04:23.785 --> 04:25.743
that the mayor is fabricating
a fake hate crime

04:25.787 --> 04:27.615
to play to her base.Bingo.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.486
LIZZIE:
"Three down"?

04:29.530 --> 04:30.574
What's that about?

04:30.618 --> 04:31.967
There've been
two other incidents

04:32.010 --> 04:33.185
against Muslims

04:33.229 --> 04:35.100
in the boroughs recently.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.363
And the lovely troll
on this thread

04:36.406 --> 04:38.321
is encouraging folks
to add number three

04:38.365 --> 04:39.975
to the body count.We got to get ahead of this.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.150
JASMINE:
Which is why

04:41.193 --> 04:42.673
I need answers
by the end of the day,

04:42.717 --> 04:44.849
when the mayor is threatening
to break with the NYPD

04:44.893 --> 04:46.808
and denounce our
position publicly.

04:46.851 --> 04:50.333
You expect us to find
the shooter in nine hours?More like eight.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.291
Go.

04:51.334 --> 04:52.292
Let's go.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.207
Detective Needham.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.252
Uh, hello.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.862
It is such an honor
to meet you.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.300
Why is that?You are a legend

05:00.343 --> 05:01.605
in the 1-19.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.172
My sergeant's always raving

05:03.215 --> 05:04.695
about your gunrunner bust
back in the day.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.262
A legend.She took down four perps

05:06.306 --> 05:08.395
by herself without even
drawing her weapon.

05:08.438 --> 05:10.658
Okay, we're on a deadline.
What are you doing here?

05:10.701 --> 05:13.095
Uh, Zack Clark. I was the first
officer on the scene last night.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.662
Ah, nice to meet you, Zack.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.490
But if you think
that blowing smoke

05:16.533 --> 05:18.318
is gonna get you out
of filing your 61...

05:18.361 --> 05:20.407
Oh, no, no, ma'am.
Uh, I have my incident report.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.365
Uh, at 2200 hours,

05:22.409 --> 05:24.106
multiple 911 calls reported

05:24.149 --> 05:25.325
hearing a single gunshot.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.978
Responding officer-- me--

05:27.022 --> 05:29.024
discovered a female victim,
unconscious,

05:29.067 --> 05:30.417
bleeding from a chest wound.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.375
Now, EMS removed victim via bus

05:32.419 --> 05:34.290
to Dutch Kills General Hospital.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.639
She went by bus?

05:35.683 --> 05:37.815
Ambulance. More lingo for you.Oh.

05:37.859 --> 05:40.383
I'm sorry. I thought you were
Detective Needham's partner.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.645
Oh, I am.

05:41.689 --> 05:42.646
Dylan Reinhart.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.387
We're partners. He's not a cop.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.736
Oh, uh...Go on.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.956
Well, uh, a canvass of the area

05:47.999 --> 05:50.262
hasn't turned up
any eyewitnesses, weapons,

05:50.306 --> 05:52.874
shell casings
or useful CCTV footage.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.397
What do you think, Zack?Oh.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.311
I'm not a detective.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.182
But it's your beat.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.662
You must have your ear
to the ground.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.186
Well, with no robbery,

06:01.230 --> 06:03.319
no sexual assault,
suggests a targeted hit.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.929
And since Rameen, the victim,

06:04.973 --> 06:06.409
took over the youth center,
it's attracted more kids,

06:06.453 --> 06:08.498
including gang affiliates
and Muslims.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.631
Older residents
are calling it a mini mosque,

06:10.674 --> 06:12.415
though I've never
seen evidence of that.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.722
Did Nancy Drew have time
to run the vic's name

06:14.765 --> 06:17.507
Yes, ma'am. The only time
Rameen had police contact

06:17.551 --> 06:19.727
was a few weeks ago
when my partner got called

06:19.770 --> 06:21.729
to a domestic argument
with her older brother.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.252
Might have led with that.

06:23.295 --> 06:27.125
Well, at the time,
he decided not to file the DIR--

06:27.169 --> 06:28.431
a Domestic Incident Report.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.477
But now I wonder.
I mean, I have heard

06:30.520 --> 06:32.653
devout families can react when
relatives get too westernized.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.655
Could this have been
an honor killing?

06:34.698 --> 06:36.439
Well, that would
be very rare--

06:36.483 --> 06:38.049
if I can say that word
without licking my chops.

06:38.093 --> 06:41.313
Okay, let's take a breath
and start at step one.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.446
You got wheels?Uh, no.

06:43.490 --> 06:46.231
I came by subway.
My shift ended at 0400.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.451
You got off the clock
four hours ago.

06:48.495 --> 06:49.365
Why are you even here?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.149
There was a shooting.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.201
You're certain my trip
won't be a problem?

06:59.244 --> 07:01.464
I-I wasn't sure of protocol.Protocol's simple:

07:01.508 --> 07:02.944
you clear your
teaching or writing

07:02.987 --> 07:04.293
or hunting schedule with me.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.164
This trip should
be okay since,

07:06.208 --> 07:07.905
according to the mayor,
we'll be done by tonight.

07:09.211 --> 07:10.778
I'm just surprised
you're a hunter.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.346
Charlie was a hunter.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.826
Did you work this beat together?

07:15.870 --> 07:17.480
Mm-mm.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.264
Are you kidding me?

07:19.308 --> 07:20.483
It's closed?

07:20.527 --> 07:22.833
This was Mrs. Wisniewski's shop.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.139
She was four foot nothing

07:24.182 --> 07:26.141
and all the drug dealers
were afraid of her.

07:26.184 --> 07:28.404
She used to make
the most god-awful pierogies.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.233
Kind of wish you had one now

07:31.276 --> 07:33.496
You can't live
in the past, Lizzie.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.194
Sure can miss it, though.

07:36.238 --> 07:39.459
LIZZIE:
Crime scene. Here we go.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.635
Excuse me.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.378
That's not encouraging.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.859
Backward "E" in "get."
May be a number three.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.252
Third victim.

07:50.295 --> 07:52.080
MAN:
Thank you all for showing up.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.691
It means so much to our family
and to my sister Rameen.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.606
That'sthe avenging brother?

07:56.650 --> 07:58.434
You all know
what a fighter Rameen is.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.044
The doctors
hope she'll stabilize

08:00.088 --> 08:01.568
so they can remove the bullet.

08:01.611 --> 08:03.700
I'm sure
Rameen will not give up.

08:05.093 --> 08:06.181
DYLAN:
What's going on?

08:06.224 --> 08:08.662
Let's find out.

08:09.967 --> 08:11.491
MAN:
I bet you know who shot her.

08:11.534 --> 08:12.317
MAN 2:
You're blocking my sidewalk.

08:12.361 --> 08:13.536
Oh, boy.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.407
It's not your sidewalk.I got a delivery.

08:15.451 --> 08:16.931
Ain't nobody shop
at your wack store anyway.

08:16.974 --> 08:17.888
Don't you talk about my...Break it up.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.368
Break it up. Hey.

08:19.411 --> 08:21.413
Break it up. A young woman
is fighting for her life.

08:21.457 --> 08:22.850
Show some respect.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.416
We got respect.
It's them doesn't any respect.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.722
Guys, can you take a step back?

08:25.766 --> 08:27.507
Everybody has a right
to be here.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.812
So just go about your business

08:28.856 --> 08:30.422
like the neighbors you are.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.729
We don't need this.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.862
LIZZIE:
Thanks, guys.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.472
Well done.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.735
Yeah, that works once.
We're gonna need backup here.

08:38.779 --> 08:39.954
Any comment, detectives?

08:39.997 --> 08:41.085
Nothing to share yet.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.565
I mean a comment
about the breaking news.

08:42.609 --> 08:43.958
What they're calling
number four.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.002
"Number four"?

08:45.046 --> 08:46.177
A mosque in the Bronx

08:46.221 --> 08:47.352
just went up in flames.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.185
♪

09:05.849 --> 09:07.329
They've assigned the Hate Crimes
Task Force to the mosque fire.

09:07.372 --> 09:08.591
You will stay focused on this.

09:08.635 --> 09:11.115
Don't let me down.
Our squad

09:11.159 --> 09:12.595
will provide backup
and coordinate

09:12.639 --> 09:14.118
to see if there's a link
between the incidents.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.076
Oh, there's not.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.207
Oh?

09:16.251 --> 09:17.948
I'm not saying
it wasn't provoked

09:17.992 --> 09:19.994
by shared sentiments,
but a shooter's not an arsonist.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.952
Their profiles are opposites.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.867
Ruling out pyromania,
which we can,

09:23.911 --> 09:26.304
arson is impulsive
and impersonal, whereas...

09:26.348 --> 09:28.393
I-I can elaborate on this
another time.

09:29.656 --> 09:32.136
Cross.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.485
She was the best.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.096
No one hated Rameen.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.881
Maybe they hated how she looked?

09:37.925 --> 09:39.404
Have there been
other problems here?

09:39.448 --> 09:41.972
Smaller things like threats
don't always get reported.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.758
People feel ashamed
of being targeted.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.542
Or they don't want
to get the police involved.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.327
There was a bag
of something nasty

09:49.371 --> 09:50.633
left here on the steps.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.156
But it was months ago.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.984
And Rameen said to
just ignore it.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.117
What about the graffiti?
When did that show up?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.771
That was us.

09:57.814 --> 09:58.989
We painted that.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.338
LIZZIE:
With a backward "E"?

10:00.382 --> 10:01.644
It looked cool.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.341
And "Go back where
you came from"?

10:03.385 --> 10:04.691
We meant Park Avenue.

10:04.734 --> 10:07.389
So who's not wanted here?

10:07.432 --> 10:10.131
Brett Maxton.The real estate scion?

10:10.174 --> 10:11.698
His family's developing
this property.

10:11.741 --> 10:13.221
And the youth center is...?Kicked out.

10:13.264 --> 10:14.657
By an eminent
domain partnership

10:14.701 --> 10:17.791
between Maxton's empire
and the city.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.096
I am beginning
to appreciate more fully

10:19.140 --> 10:21.490
our mayor's interest
in this case.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.361
City Hall and Maxton
pulled off their unholy alliance

10:23.405 --> 10:25.233
without much press,
but my sister's shooting

10:25.276 --> 10:27.191
could stir things up.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.150
I'm sorry, but I've got
to get back to the hospital.Oh, we understand.

10:29.193 --> 10:31.152
If you could just answer
a couple more questions.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.588
We heard

10:32.632 --> 10:34.155
Rameen's headscarf is missing.

10:34.198 --> 10:35.809
My parents told the police

10:35.852 --> 10:37.593
because she left home
wearing it,

10:37.637 --> 10:39.464
but I know Rameen
doesn't always keep it on

10:39.508 --> 10:41.162
when she's not with family.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.293
Your family's devout?

10:42.337 --> 10:44.121
My folks are more traditional

10:44.165 --> 10:45.645
than Rameen, or me.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.516
But they're not zealots.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.997
They're just parents trying
to adjust to a changing world.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.694
Like all of us.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.000
And like many young women,
Rameen's discovering

10:53.043 --> 10:54.784
for herself what the head scarf
means for her.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.134
You say head scarf, not hijab.

10:57.178 --> 10:59.702
Yeah. I'm American;
I speak English.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.054
We won't hold you any longer.
My respects to your family.

11:04.098 --> 11:07.318
One more thing: We heard
you had an angry argument

11:07.362 --> 11:09.712
with Rameen a few weeks ago.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.279
Yeah. She wanted
to fight Maxton.

11:11.322 --> 11:13.803
Stage protests over
closing the center.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.675
I told her Maxton is
a billionaire bully

11:15.718 --> 11:17.589
from a long line of bullies.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.287
He warned her he'd crush her.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.941
I was afraid he would.

11:22.594 --> 11:25.380
I'm saying don't cut off a line
of inquiry with a suspect.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.512
Surely you don't think that
perfectly normal young man

11:27.556 --> 11:29.384
shot his sister in
a medieval rage?

11:29.427 --> 11:31.386
I don't.
Well, hello.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.301
Tick tock. Time's
winged chariot and all.

11:33.344 --> 11:36.260
Even with a deadline, to
investigate is to be thorough.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.261
To plod.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.437
Certainly not to cut corners.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.178
Even when you
see a dead end?
Okay.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.963
Your instincts may be more
finely-tuned than mine,

11:43.006 --> 11:45.487
but for me, working a case
means being methodical

11:45.530 --> 11:47.576
and presuming
as little as possible.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.404
So you have no
presumptions about the man

11:49.447 --> 11:51.275
that's kept us
waiting for 20 minutes?

11:51.319 --> 11:54.278
No, this guy's a total dick.

11:54.322 --> 11:57.107
Who's apparently a fan of the
Jetson's school of architecture.

11:59.457 --> 12:02.765
Brett Maxton.
Sorry for the delay,

12:02.809 --> 12:05.072
but it gave you a chance
to admire our vision here.

12:05.115 --> 12:07.770
Kind of takes the breath away.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.293
I bet the rents will, too.

12:09.337 --> 12:10.860
These are all condos,

12:10.904 --> 12:12.209
but we'll have rentals

12:12.253 --> 12:13.776
in phase two.LIZZIE: Oh, phew.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.300
BRETT:
I know some people fear change,

12:16.344 --> 12:18.389
but we're bringing jobs,
revenue, improved infrastructure

12:18.433 --> 12:20.304
and new schools to an area

12:20.348 --> 12:23.090
that was crying out
to be re-branded.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.092
You play squash?Since I could walk.

12:25.135 --> 12:26.180
Ah.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.704
But how's Rameen?
I was hoping you guys

12:28.748 --> 12:30.010
brought me some good news.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.228
She's still critical.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.621
Damn shame.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.101
She's my kind of gal.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.190
I sent my orthopod
to take a look at her.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.408
Rameen deserves the best.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.888
We heard you threatened
to crush her.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.542
Sure did. She hit me,

12:40.585 --> 12:42.326
I hit back.
It's how I do business.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.024
And how would you do that?
Hit her back?

12:44.067 --> 12:47.331
It was a bluff. I ended up
shelling out two mill

12:47.375 --> 12:49.464
to move her center
to a new location.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.205
Cash for her cause,

12:51.248 --> 12:53.033
tax write-off for me.
Win-win.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.251
We'll be in touch.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.689
LIZZIE: Oh, uh,
what's the re

12:57.733 --> 13:00.344
What are you calling
the new neighborhood?

13:00.388 --> 13:02.956
Listoria.

13:02.999 --> 13:07.134
For Land Intersecting Astoria.

13:07.177 --> 13:09.266
Sort of like the
foodborne bacteria

13:09.310 --> 13:11.181
that causes
projectile vomiting?

13:11.225 --> 13:13.140
Yeah.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.926
Thanks, guys. Dig up
whatever you can

13:16.970 --> 13:20.190
about Maxton's contract
with the youth center.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.845
That sleaze can't be
taken at face value.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.369
And Q&A with that guy's
a waste of time.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.414
What is that?

13:29.199 --> 13:30.940
Detective Needham.

13:30.984 --> 13:32.463
You stole that?

13:32.507 --> 13:34.770
I liberated it from
the demolition heap.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.338
Stan's bodega.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.646
Charlie and I didn't work
the 119 together,

13:41.690 --> 13:44.998
but I met him there,
on my first day, at Stan's.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.826
He was on his way out.
I was nervous.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.610
He told me I'd be fine.

13:48.653 --> 13:52.875
"Just remember," he said,
"cops don't change the world."

13:52.919 --> 13:54.398
Sounds like Charlie
thought you might need

13:54.442 --> 13:55.878
to check your idealism.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.401
Idealism being...

13:57.445 --> 13:59.186
Charlie was right.
We don't change the world,

13:59.229 --> 14:00.709
it's changed
by angry online trolls

14:00.752 --> 14:02.363
and guys like Brett Maxton.

14:02.406 --> 14:05.366
...idealism being the
prelude to cynicism.

14:05.409 --> 14:08.369
I'm not cynical. I'm...Good, I caught you.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.110
Our brass catcher's
ballistics report is out.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.415
How did you find us?

14:11.459 --> 14:13.374
I thought Brett Maxton
might be your next stop.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.592
Go on.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.246
Well, they can only
rely on the X-ray

14:16.290 --> 14:18.466
of the victim's spine until
they get the bullet out,

14:18.509 --> 14:20.990
but it's consistent
with a .22 cal.And the entry wound?

14:21.034 --> 14:23.775
From above, downward,
high angle.Burns

14:23.819 --> 14:26.169
So shot from a distance,
probably a rifle.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.954
And only one shot?
Yeah.

14:27.997 --> 14:28.868
And under cover
of darkness.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.391
We're looking for a marksman.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.524
There. Fourth floor,

14:33.568 --> 14:34.874
front apartment window.

14:34.917 --> 14:37.572
Whoever lives there
had the perfect shot.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.400
Come on.

14:42.577 --> 14:46.102
131. Ana Kalinski
is the landlady,

14:46.146 --> 14:48.104
or used to be.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.714
Wait till you
meet her...

14:49.758 --> 14:52.282
Please come in,
Detective, um...

14:52.326 --> 14:54.328
Needham. Don't you
remember me?

14:54.371 --> 14:57.592
I do. I was asking about, uh...

14:57.635 --> 15:00.638
Oh, I'm Dylan Reinhart.
Detective Needham's boss.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.293
I love your building.Oh.

15:03.337 --> 15:06.514
I'm afraid, like me,
it's seen better days.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.733
:
Oh, come on.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.518
Don't sell your building,
or yourself, short.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.650
I know a classic when I see it,
Mrs. Kalinski.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.349
My boss is
so right, Mrs. K.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.351
The new hair
really suits you.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.569
And have you
lost a few pounds?

15:18.613 --> 15:22.878
I had to make an effort
after Mr. K died,

15:22.922 --> 15:25.881
but I hate it when women
let themselves go.

15:25.925 --> 15:26.969
DYLAN:
Mmm.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.492
But be kind.

15:28.536 --> 15:31.104
Most women don't have
as much to work with.

15:31.147 --> 15:34.672
Oh, a charmer.
Just like my husband.

15:34.716 --> 15:38.024
He liked the finer things,
as I can tell you do.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.635
We've come to ask you
about the shooting.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.680
Horrible.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.161
But I can't pretend

15:45.205 --> 15:46.684
I didn't see it coming.

15:46.728 --> 15:49.687
When you bring in
a certain element...

15:49.731 --> 15:51.254
Who rents the front apartment
on the fourth floor?

15:51.298 --> 15:52.473
Troy.

15:52.516 --> 15:55.867
Was Troy mixed up in this?

15:55.911 --> 15:57.347
Do you think he could be?

15:57.391 --> 15:59.306
I don't know.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.961
H-He came back from Iran

16:02.004 --> 16:04.398
or wherever, different.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.530
PTSD.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.271
And he's had
some run-ins

16:08.315 --> 16:10.360
with that Muslim girl.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.319
Oh, no.What's wrong?

16:12.362 --> 16:15.148
I didn't see Troy last night.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.367
With the sirens and all...

16:17.411 --> 16:19.587
that kind of thing
can set him off.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.719
So I tried to peek in,

16:21.763 --> 16:24.113
but he changed the lock.
You don't think...

16:24.157 --> 16:26.289
Well, let's find out.

16:31.599 --> 16:34.558
Police. Troy, open up.

16:34.602 --> 16:35.559
Is there another way in?

16:35.603 --> 16:37.170
From the fire escape.

16:37.213 --> 16:40.564
You'd have to jump,
but a strong man like...

16:40.608 --> 16:42.392
I got it. Stay here.

16:42.436 --> 16:43.828
Mm-hmm.

16:43.872 --> 16:48.181
Oh, your gold
slippers remind me of a girl

16:48.224 --> 16:49.704
who broke my heart.: Oh.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.141
They're very chic.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.403
Ah, lovely.

16:54.752 --> 16:55.927
I'm in!

16:57.190 --> 16:59.018
NYPD.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.412
Troy

17:04.414 --> 17:06.503
Oh, no. Is he dead?

17:18.167 --> 17:20.865
DYLAN:
I believe introductions
are in order.

17:20.909 --> 17:24.217
Dylan Reinhart. Meet
Detective Lizzie Needham.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.046
And you, I presume, are Troy.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.012
Look, I-I'm not a danger
to myself. I hadn't slept

17:37.056 --> 17:39.449
in three days, so I took a pill
and put on my tunes.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.364
Which finally knocked me out
around 9:00,

17:41.408 --> 17:43.540
until... just now, when...

17:43.584 --> 17:44.802
What do you listen to?

17:44.846 --> 17:46.500
Mostly jazz.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.806
Bud Powell last night.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.548
Yeah, I'm not supposed to drink
with the pills,

17:51.592 --> 17:53.550
but...
I was desperate.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.340
LIZZIE:
What did you do
in Afghanistan?

18:00.383 --> 18:01.645
TROY:
I was a cook.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.560
Then how come you got
a sharpshooter badge?

18:03.604 --> 18:05.954
Uh, my first MOS
was field artillery.

18:05.997 --> 18:08.217
They, uh...  they
reassigned me when my symptoms

18:08.261 --> 18:09.653
started showing.DYLAN: Your landlady thinks

18:09.697 --> 18:11.960
you have PTSD, but she's wrong,
isn't she?

18:12.003 --> 18:14.310
Yeah.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.617
I'm, uh, I have schizophrenia.

18:16.660 --> 18:17.879
DYLAN: Ah.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.315
So Bud Powell, the jumpy stuff,

18:19.359 --> 18:20.925
wouldn't put
most people to sleep,

18:20.969 --> 18:22.623
but it drowns out the chatter.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.668
Look, look, I'm med,
I'm med-compliant.

18:24.712 --> 18:27.628
I'm not depressed; my landlady's
a bitch, so you can go.

18:27.671 --> 18:29.804
There was a shooting at the
youth center last night.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.197
The director was shot.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.982
The
Uh, is she okay?

18:34.025 --> 18:35.288
She's in the hospital.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.768
LIZZIE:
Did you hear anything?

18:37.812 --> 18:41.163
Do you own a gun?No, I'm not allowed to. Um...

18:41.207 --> 18:43.513
I was hospitalized
a few years ago.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.036
So, legally you can't,
but do you have one anyway?

18:46.212 --> 18:47.517
W-W-W-Wait.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.171
Are you...

18:49.215 --> 18:50.999
I was asleep.

18:51.042 --> 18:53.567
I didn't even know that girl.We heard you had some issues.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.177
You guys think she's Muslim,
she's my enemy?

18:55.221 --> 18:57.527
We're gonna need you to come
with us to the station house.

18:57.571 --> 18:58.876
Yeah, then you'll plant
a gun in here.

18:58.920 --> 18:59.964
No way.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.098
Nope.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.144
We shouldn't take him in.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.189
Why not?
How to say this

19:07.233 --> 19:08.495
without invoking "instinct"?

19:08.538 --> 19:09.844
Yes, this guy was
a sharpshooter,

19:09.887 --> 19:11.541
and he had a shot
from his window,

19:11.585 --> 19:13.587
but he's hardly giving off
the cool assassin vibe.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.632
With pills and alcohol,
he could've experienced

19:15.676 --> 19:17.547
blackout behaviors and not even
know what he did.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.507
You're right. Okay.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.770
Okay, look. I know
the mentally ill

19:22.813 --> 19:24.380
aren't more violent than
the general population,

19:24.424 --> 19:25.990
but to presume innocence

19:26.034 --> 19:28.123
is just as reckless
as jumping to guilt.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.299
He never actually answered
my question about the gun.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.866
Right, boss.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.998
I mean it.
I'll slow down.

19:34.042 --> 19:36.566
Here's a lead
you might enjoy tracking.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.612
Looks like Brett Maxton
wasn't entirely honest

19:38.655 --> 19:40.396
about paying the center's
relocation costs.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.181
Shocking.
He struck a deal

19:42.224 --> 19:43.617
for $2 million with Rameen,

19:43.660 --> 19:45.749
but then hasn't even made
the initial payment yet.

19:45.793 --> 19:46.881
What about Troy?

19:46.924 --> 19:48.622
Your instinct's right.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.058
We'll get better cooperation
keeping him here.

19:50.101 --> 19:51.842
I'll sit on Troy
until the guys can get

19:51.886 --> 19:54.149
a search warrant, and then
I'll get patrol to babysit.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.978
Oh. I know just the
young officer for the job.

19:57.021 --> 20:01.069
And I know just the guy to help
us crack Brett Maxton's books.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.160
This is more than a favor.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.075
It's a game of squash.
You're on the same team.

20:07.118 --> 20:10.078
I have assets in Pyongyang
I trust more than Brett Maxton.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.515
But surely your alter ego,
"Oliver Tate," must relish

20:12.559 --> 20:14.909
the chance to hobnob
with real estate royalty.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.737
You think Maxton's
capable of murder?

20:16.780 --> 20:18.652
As your father once said,
"Aren't we all?"

20:18.695 --> 20:20.741
I'm seeing him this weekend.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.090
Hunting trip.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.526
You must be
dreading that.

20:23.570 --> 20:25.136
Yes and no.

20:25.180 --> 20:28.792
Will he try to drag
you in from the cold?
Always.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.752
How is it you know everything
about my father,

20:31.795 --> 20:34.755
and I know nothing about yours?I'm better at this than you.

20:34.798 --> 20:37.801
Also, I didn't go into
the family business.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.716
My dad isn't head spook.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.458
Just try to stay out
of his line of fire.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.984
Brett's locker combination
and computer password--

20:47.028 --> 20:49.073
you've got it?
Yeah.

20:49.117 --> 20:52.642
Once you find what you need,
you can download it here.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.644
Is this the best you can do?

20:54.688 --> 20:56.385
It's the best youcan do.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.300
We both know tech-savvy
is not among your superpowers.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.737
We have the court
for an hour,

21:00.781 --> 21:02.391
but I usually thrash him
quicker.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.611
Can't you go easy on him today?For you,

21:04.654 --> 21:06.830
I will compromise my morals,
my dating standards,

21:06.874 --> 21:08.223
my allegiance
to queen and country,

21:08.267 --> 21:10.051
but I will not compromise
my game.

21:17.232 --> 21:19.016
Hey. Uh, Steve called.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.540
Said to give him
a call back when you can.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.759
He sounds nice.

21:22.803 --> 21:25.109
But, uh, if you ask me, he's
trying a little too hard.

21:26.676 --> 21:27.808
What are you doing here

21:27.851 --> 21:30.114
and why are you
answering our phones?

21:30.158 --> 21:32.726
'Cause it's my job.
I got it, all thanks to you.

21:32.769 --> 21:35.206
I am the new homicide
administrative assistant.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.818
I used to bend the law,
now I uphold it.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.950
I'm like Dirty Harry.

21:39.994 --> 21:41.125
But without, you know, like,

21:41.169 --> 21:43.345
the gun and the badge and...

21:43.389 --> 21:45.173
with a pretty severe case
of asthma, actually.

21:45.216 --> 21:46.217
Oh! I gotta get that.

22:09.763 --> 22:13.157
New member? I've
never seen you here.

22:13.201 --> 22:15.856
Uh... no, you haven't.
Yes, I am new.

22:15.899 --> 22:18.511
Ah. They must have given you
an old combo.

22:18.554 --> 22:20.339
You're punching in three digits.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.819
They just changed to four.
We can call an attendant.

22:22.863 --> 22:25.039
What's your name?Um, it's, uh...

22:25.082 --> 22:26.519
It's-it's Oliver Tate.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.477
Call for help with that.

22:57.027 --> 22:59.813
♪

23:21.138 --> 23:24.098
LIZZIE: Those are
Rameen's parents.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.927
Unfortunately, the
call was premature.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.711
She won't be able to answer
questions for a few hours,

23:28.755 --> 23:30.321
but she did pull through,

23:30.365 --> 23:31.627
and the surgeon
removed the bullet.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.455
It's on its way
to ballistics right now.

23:33.499 --> 23:35.457
Any weapons turn up
in Troy's apartment?
No.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.025
But his computer has a history
of searches on conspiracy sites.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.722
Oh, like 63% of all American...

23:39.766 --> 23:41.681
Okay, I'm just plodding
here. No need to jump.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.900
What did you find?

23:43.944 --> 23:44.901
Well, I may have
come into possession

23:44.945 --> 23:46.599
of a trove
of Brett Maxton data...

23:46.642 --> 23:48.252
Don't tell me how.

23:48.296 --> 23:50.472
...which I passed on
to a lawyer to decipher.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.213
I hope this lawyer
is discreet.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.345
Oh, I would trust him
with my life.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.713
Put it on speaker.Lieutenant, yes,
I hear you, but...

24:13.756 --> 24:15.323
Hate Crimes is
taking over.

24:15.366 --> 24:16.977
Put it on speaker.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.458
No, of course we can't ignore
an escalation like this.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.155
Subway attack on
Sikh tourists.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.549
I agree, it's
blowing up, but...Put her on speaker.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.725
Of course, Hate Crimes has
to come on board, but...

24:25.768 --> 24:27.378
But keep us on it, too!

24:27.422 --> 24:30.251
Let us follow the shooting.I was going to say that.

24:30.294 --> 24:32.253
JASMINE:
Are you making progress?BOTH: Yes!

24:32.296 --> 24:33.820
Well, if you want
to take the next few hours...

24:33.863 --> 24:35.517
Yes, thank you, we will.
That's great. Thanks. Bye.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.345
You hung up on her...
on my phone.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.607
She was heading towards a yes.
I just didn't

24:38.651 --> 24:40.827
want to give her
a chance to say...

24:44.091 --> 24:45.788
Police! Stop!

25:10.378 --> 25:13.903
Up!

25:18.778 --> 25:20.388
Kevin?

25:20.431 --> 25:22.869
He a friend of yours?I knew him as a kid.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.479
Right, Kev?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.046
Kev was one of
the smart ones.

25:26.089 --> 25:29.702
Knew when I was packing
gummy bears, knew I'd share.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.878
My partner thinks
I'm stuck in the past,

25:31.921 --> 25:34.663
but those were good times,
right, Kev

25:34.707 --> 25:36.709
How many ways have you broken
your mom's heart since then?

25:36.752 --> 25:38.667
Look, I still help my mom.Hey.

25:38.711 --> 25:41.888
Hey, hey, what's
this thing for?

25:41.931 --> 25:42.976
You here to harm Rameen?

25:43.019 --> 25:44.847
N-No, Miss Rameen's
been good to me.

25:44.891 --> 25:47.763
Hey, this is her hijab.

25:47.807 --> 25:50.287
She-she left it
at the park, okay?

25:50.331 --> 25:51.680
Why did you run from us?

25:51.724 --> 25:52.942
You got any warrants, Kev?

25:52.986 --> 25:55.597
Anything on you
I should be concerned about?

25:55.641 --> 25:57.686
I didn't shoot her.Do you know who did?

25:57.730 --> 25:59.819
You ever have a gun?
I'll ask around

25:59.862 --> 26:01.081
and find out if
you're lying.It wasn't me, okay?

26:01.124 --> 26:02.996
I gave the gun to Troy.

26:04.737 --> 26:05.738
I guess we are making progress.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.878
Kev's more a poser
than a banger.

26:15.922 --> 26:18.011
A good kid,
but he makes stuff up.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.360
I don't know about any gun.

26:19.403 --> 26:21.928
[gasps,
siren blaring]

26:21.971 --> 26:23.843
And too many cops,
too much noise.

26:23.886 --> 26:25.845
Yeah, there's a vigil
planned for tonight.

26:25.888 --> 26:27.368
That's a bad idea.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.022
Man, things could
go sideways fast.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.633
You must have seen a
lot of that on base.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.854
You know I didn't catch
schizophrenia in battle, right?

26:34.897 --> 26:38.031
Yeah. You were just the
right age for a break.

26:39.902 --> 26:41.600
Do the meds help
your voices?

26:44.167 --> 26:45.952
Most inner voices

26:45.995 --> 26:49.390
are intrusive and critical.

26:49.433 --> 26:52.567
I don't have
the same diagnosis as you,

26:52.611 --> 26:54.569
but I do know what it's like
to have voices in my head.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.918
I've had them since childhood.

26:55.962 --> 26:59.052
Sometimes I have to work
hard to ignore them,

26:59.095 --> 27:01.663
figure out
what's true.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.839
Yeah, who to trust?

27:05.711 --> 27:08.104
Look, I want
to help you through this,

27:08.148 --> 27:11.238
but I can't
if you don't tell the truth.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.022
So what about this gun?

27:13.066 --> 27:14.763
Kev started packing for show.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.765
And I had words
with him about it

27:16.809 --> 27:18.767
right here on this stoop
last Saturday.

27:18.811 --> 27:21.074
Thanks for being honest.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.815
Yeah, but...
but you won't find that gun.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.425
Why not?

27:24.468 --> 27:26.122
I threw it
in the construction Dumpster.

27:26.166 --> 27:27.689
That gun's...

27:27.733 --> 27:29.648
It's long gone.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.824
ZACK:
Garbage was collected
yesterday.

27:31.867 --> 27:34.740
Still, I need you
to identify every snot rag,

27:34.783 --> 27:37.220
every dirty diaper,
every rancid chicken bone.

27:37.264 --> 27:38.831
You want photos, too?

27:38.874 --> 27:40.354
Are you being a smart

27:40.397 --> 27:42.835
No, ma'am. I want to be thorough
and not miss anything.

27:42.878 --> 27:44.880
Knock yourself out.

27:52.758 --> 27:55.717
Like I said, almost empty,

27:55.761 --> 27:57.763
except for this.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.852
That was easy.

27:59.895 --> 28:01.854
Uh, complete that thought.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.682
Too easy?

28:07.773 --> 28:13.039
LIZZIE:
Okay, no prints on the gun,
but while ballistics runs it,

28:13.082 --> 28:15.911
we'll take turns with Troy.He wouldn't tell us
where he threw the gun

28:15.955 --> 28:17.434
just to lie about when.

28:17.478 --> 28:18.740
Unless he shot her.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.394
We need to clear up
the discrepancies,

28:20.437 --> 28:21.787
even if his answers
contradict your gut.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.789
FUCCI:
Well, Hate Crimes
is on this now.

28:23.832 --> 28:26.748
Why sweat it? Unless...
you're bucking for 2nd Grade.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.533
She's just trying to set the
right example for Shiny New Toy.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.666
Told you it might stick.JASMINE:
Nice work.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.450
Hate Crimes agrees
that their suspects

28:33.494 --> 28:34.669
aren't associated
with your guy,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.410
so he's only good
for the shooting.

28:36.453 --> 28:37.803
But let's seal it
with a perp walk.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.456
Whoa. Whoa. We haven't begun
interrogation.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.762
We're not there yet.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.198
Is this coming
from the mayor?

28:42.242 --> 28:44.200
It's coming from me, Detective.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.724
We got crowds
descending for a vigil,

28:45.767 --> 28:46.942
and we can defuse the situation

28:46.986 --> 28:48.814
with an announcement
before dark.

28:48.857 --> 28:51.773
But it's premature. Troy
isn't even under arrest.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.296
So collar him.
The guy had means:

28:53.340 --> 28:55.081
access to a gun
that he lied about.

28:55.124 --> 28:57.866
He had motive: issues with the
victim, and he had opportunity:

28:57.910 --> 29:00.608
right out his window.He's cooperating now,

29:00.651 --> 29:03.611
but that might stop if he's put
through a stressful ordeal.

29:03.654 --> 29:06.701
Which is why I'll take over
the interrogation.
Jasmine!

29:06.745 --> 29:08.964
Lieutenant, please just
give us another hour

29:09.008 --> 29:10.879
with him as a favor, please.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.489
Is that ballistics?

29:12.533 --> 29:14.796
Mm-hmm.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.929
They got a hit.
The gun's a match.

29:16.972 --> 29:18.582
It was used
to shoot Rameen.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.280
Make his arrest official
and transfer him to the Tombs.

29:20.323 --> 29:21.847
I'll alert the press.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.762
A pistol?!

29:23.805 --> 29:27.766
What happened to plodding,
not cutting corners?

29:27.809 --> 29:30.333
That pistol from that window
is a near-impossible shot.

29:30.377 --> 29:32.858
He is a trained marksman.

29:32.901 --> 29:35.948
But a murderer?
I don't believe he did it.

29:35.991 --> 29:37.819
It's not our job to
convict or exonerate.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.560
That's for the courts.

29:39.603 --> 29:42.345
We go after the truth until
it's taken out of our hands, and

29:42.389 --> 29:44.826
if that's me being cynical or
just knowing how things work...

29:44.870 --> 29:46.219
Okay, okay,
I get it, boss.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.786
Cops don't
change the world.

29:51.006 --> 29:52.791
So what's next?

29:52.834 --> 29:55.837
Next, I do my job,
and you go home and pack.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.665
Enjoy your hunting trip.

30:14.943 --> 30:17.293
Wait.

30:19.992 --> 30:22.385
Here.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.917
Officer?

30:31.960 --> 30:35.050
Look up every mention
of Troy you can find--

30:35.094 --> 30:38.793
summons, public records, 61s,
anytime you even heard his name.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.927
Do it now.
Yes, ma'am.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.885
MAN: Troy!WOMAN:
Hey, Troy. Troy, Troy, Troy.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.278
WOMAN:
Any comment about the gun?

30:45.321 --> 30:46.975
Where did you get that

30:47.019 --> 30:49.021
Any details on what you did?
Any details at all?

30:49.064 --> 30:50.500
WOMAN 2:
Did you do it?

30:50.544 --> 30:51.980
Hey.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.503
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

30:53.547 --> 30:54.983
I got to take a shower

30:55.027 --> 30:57.464
after digging through
Brett Maxton's documents.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.074
What a sleaze.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.859
Please tell me
you found something felonious.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.686
That's the worst part.
I-It's all legal,

31:02.730 --> 31:04.166
how the Maxtons operate.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.907
They did it in Brooklyn,
now they're doing it in Queens.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.866
They make
slightly above-market offers

31:07.909 --> 31:09.824
and gobble up whole blocks,

31:09.868 --> 31:12.348
but in the fine print,
structure the payment schedules

31:12.392 --> 31:15.003
tied to an index
chosen by the obligor.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.527
Can you say that in any
of the languages I'm fluent in?

31:17.571 --> 31:19.921
Maxton can stretch his payments
over so many years,

31:19.965 --> 31:22.271
his payees won't get their money
for decades.

31:22.315 --> 31:24.143
By the time Rameen's
youth center is paid off,

31:24.186 --> 31:25.971
those teens will be 75.

31:29.104 --> 31:30.540
I forgot
how good you are at this.

31:30.584 --> 31:33.456
Thanks. I had some fun.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.067
At least one of us
is up to the job.

31:35.110 --> 31:38.461
Uh

31:38.505 --> 31:40.986
I don't know.
I didn't take this on

31:41.029 --> 31:44.076
believing that I could surpass
experienced detectives...

31:44.119 --> 31:46.034
Like Lizzie.Uh-huh. But...

31:46.078 --> 31:48.297
I did expect my talents

31:48.341 --> 31:50.952
to be added value.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.215
Maybe I'm not the expert
I like to think I am.

31:53.259 --> 31:54.956
Oh, no. No, we're
not doing that.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.827
You're about to go
and see your father

31:56.871 --> 31:58.960
who's always judged you
unfairly, so you're pregaming

31:59.004 --> 32:00.962
by beating yourself
up. I won't have it.

32:02.050 --> 32:03.399
Get him out of your head, Dylan.

32:07.142 --> 32:08.100
ANDY:
Banked it in.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.148
DYLAN:
You're right.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.935
Our hunting, his faint praise--

32:16.978 --> 32:18.197
it's all tied in.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.590
My first kill.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.157
Hunting with my father.

32:22.201 --> 32:24.986
I actually aimed away.

32:29.034 --> 32:31.079
But the bullet ricocheted.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.954
Hell of a shot.

32:35.997 --> 32:38.260
I got to go.

32:38.304 --> 32:39.783
You may have just helped us
solve this case.

32:39.827 --> 32:41.089
Anytime.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.048
Lizzie, I have a theory
that may free Troy,

32:43.091 --> 32:44.266
but I need your help
to prove it.

32:44.310 --> 32:47.052
What if this wasn't
a hell of a shot?

32:47.095 --> 32:48.096
What if this
was the worst shot ever?

32:59.673 --> 33:01.240
You were right.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.111
Ballistics did a
chemical analysis,

33:03.155 --> 33:05.026
found traces of aluminum
on the bullet. Look at you,

33:05.070 --> 33:07.550
plodding
through physical evidence.

33:07.594 --> 33:08.508
What made you think
it ricocheted?

33:08.551 --> 33:10.989
Instinct.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.078
They also found

33:13.121 --> 33:14.993
traces of paint. Bright orange.

33:18.213 --> 33:20.737
Colors match,

33:20.781 --> 33:23.262
and they verified the spot
the bullet hit. Go up.

33:23.305 --> 33:24.611
Take a look. I've already been.

33:24.654 --> 33:26.221
Oh, no, I'm good.
So, the bullet hit there,

33:26.265 --> 33:27.614
then veered...

33:27.657 --> 33:29.616
Down to where Rameen
fell. The thing is,

33:29.659 --> 33:31.139
there was no shot
from Troy's window

33:31.183 --> 33:32.749
to where the bullet hit,
but there is a shot...

33:32.793 --> 33:34.316
You don't want to ride up
and take a look?

33:34.360 --> 33:36.057
I can visualize.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.972
Oh, my God,
you're scared of heights.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.062
I have a healthy respect
for elevation, yes.Oh.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.368
Then you're gonna love
where we're going next.

33:42.411 --> 33:43.978
Please don't tell me
we're going on the roof.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.675
We're going on the roof!

33:48.722 --> 33:50.637
Be careful out there.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.204
I'm nowhere near the edge.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.075
I mean the tar.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.034
Oh.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.948
Oh, why didn't you warn me?

33:57.992 --> 34:00.038
I did warn you.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.085
Look at that.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.087
Footprints.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.785
I don't think
we should disturb the scene.

34:08.829 --> 34:10.222
Do you need a hand?

34:10.265 --> 34:12.267
No.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.835
Hey!

34:14.878 --> 34:17.011
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.Yes, yes, yes.

34:33.419 --> 34:34.594
ZACK:
Hey, guys.

34:35.682 --> 34:37.205
Did you plant a GPS

34:37.249 --> 34:38.380
in Detective Needham's neck?

34:38.424 --> 34:40.382
No, sir, I asked
the officers downstairs.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.906
Have you found anything on Troy?

34:42.950 --> 34:45.126
Yeah, but it may
not matter. Rumor is

34:45.170 --> 34:47.041
he's gonna take a plea.Oh.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.869
Troy confessed?I was worried

34:48.912 --> 34:50.392
he'd be pressured into it.

34:50.436 --> 34:51.567
And once he files
an official plea in court,

34:51.611 --> 34:52.612
he'll be sent away.

34:52.655 --> 34:54.135
What did you find out?Not much.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.268
Troy filed a complaint
with the Housing Authority.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.400
Normal stuff
like leaks, rodents.

34:58.444 --> 34:59.923
Were there any
counter

34:59.967 --> 35:01.360
What are you thinking?

35:01.403 --> 35:05.190
Rameen wasn't the target.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.235
Troy was.

35:08.323 --> 35:11.283
I just saw him on the news.

35:11.326 --> 35:13.198
Poor boy.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.504
But I can't say
I'm not relieved.

35:15.548 --> 35:18.116
I'm sure.
Such an unstable person

35:18.159 --> 35:20.118
living here for so many years.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.729
At least he will get
the care he needs

35:22.772 --> 35:24.165
if he pleads insanity.

35:24.209 --> 35:27.473
I could testify
to help with that.Thanks.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.170
You're way ahead of us. There is

35:29.214 --> 35:32.130
one thing about Troy's
confession that doesn't add up.

35:32.173 --> 35:34.915
He claims he threw the gun away
five days ago,

35:34.958 --> 35:37.135
before the trash collection.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.484
Can you shed any
light on that?

35:38.527 --> 35:41.182
Well, uh, yes.

35:41.226 --> 35:44.316
I heard him
and that gang boy

35:44.359 --> 35:47.971
arguing on the stoop
about a gun just yesterday.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.277
And you know what,

35:49.321 --> 35:52.628
I saw him
heading to the Dumpster

35:52.672 --> 35:55.153
after the shooting.I-I'm sorry.

35:55.196 --> 35:56.719
I thought you said
Troy never left his room.

35:56.763 --> 35:59.418
Well, I meant that gang boy

35:59.461 --> 36:01.246
went to the Dumpster.Ah.

36:01.289 --> 36:05.206
Maybe Troy
threw the gun down to him.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.425
You're very good at this.

36:06.468 --> 36:08.862
You can count on me
as a witness.

36:08.905 --> 36:11.212
It's like you said
when we met, you knew

36:11.256 --> 36:12.735
something like this
was gonna happen.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.215
You're intriguing, Ana.

36:14.259 --> 36:17.523
In fact, you're the
only person I've met

36:17.566 --> 36:19.046
in the last ten hours

36:19.089 --> 36:21.614
whose behavior is
mysterious to me.

36:21.657 --> 36:23.833
Why is such a stylish woman

36:23.877 --> 36:26.619
who is so much better maintained
than the building she owns

36:26.662 --> 36:29.361
still stuck
in a neighborhood like this?

36:29.404 --> 36:30.884
Why hasn't she sold out?

36:30.927 --> 36:33.234
She's so clearly
in her prime.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.322
Ready to move on.

36:34.366 --> 36:35.976
Deserves the finer things.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.238
Oh, well...

36:37.282 --> 36:38.761
But you couldn't sell,
could you, Mrs. K?

36:38.805 --> 36:40.198
Brett Maxton
wouldn't buy a building

36:40.241 --> 36:42.896
with a rent-controlled tenant,
a disabled vet

36:42.939 --> 36:44.376
whose apartment
is protected.

36:44.419 --> 36:45.986
A developer would be
as stuck with him

36:46.029 --> 36:47.335
as you have been.

36:47.379 --> 36:48.815
So you had to get rid of him.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.251
You tried eviction,
but the Housing Commission

36:50.295 --> 36:51.687
was on his side.

36:51.731 --> 36:53.080
DYLAN:
Then, last week,

36:53.123 --> 36:54.995
you overheard Troy and Kev

36:55.038 --> 36:56.692
arguing about a gun.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.260
You saw
where Troy threw it away,

36:59.304 --> 37:01.219
and you retrieved it.

37:04.352 --> 37:05.788
LIZZIE:
You only meant to fire wild

37:05.832 --> 37:07.312
and have Troy blamed.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.704
DYLAN:
Your plan would've worked,

37:08.748 --> 37:12.273
but Troy changed the locks,

37:12.317 --> 37:13.970
and you had
to throw the gun away.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.190
LIZZIE: And Rameen may live,
so if you cooperate...

37:16.234 --> 37:18.845
I do not go on the roof.
No one does.

37:18.888 --> 37:21.195
It's not safe.I agree.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.415
And I tried to tell
my partner that, but...

37:23.458 --> 37:24.372
she's the boss.

37:24.416 --> 37:26.679
From the Dumpster.

37:34.382 --> 37:35.557
REPORTER: Breaking news

37:35.601 --> 37:36.732
from the suspected
hate crime in Queens...

37:36.776 --> 37:37.820
"Awesome job."

37:37.864 --> 37:39.387
That is a direct quote

37:39.431 --> 37:41.302
from the mayor, who's on her way
to join the vigil.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.348
It looks like Rameen will live,

37:43.391 --> 37:44.871
and even Brett
Maxton is hopping

37:44.914 --> 37:46.525
on the goodwill
train, announcing

37:46.568 --> 37:48.831
that he will donate outright a
new home for the youth center.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.311
What got into him?

37:50.355 --> 37:52.748
He may have been threatened
with some bad PR.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.925
Well, the prevailing story

37:55.969 --> 37:58.232
in the media
is our city keeping calm

37:58.276 --> 38:00.016
and carrying on
against zealotry.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.366
How's the Twitterverse?

38:01.409 --> 38:03.281
Freedom of speech
continues to run amok.

38:03.324 --> 38:04.934
God bless America.

38:04.978 --> 38:06.806
How did you two crack this one?

38:06.849 --> 38:08.982
Ask Shiny New.

38:09.025 --> 38:12.464
Hate crimes
aren't the only aberration

38:12.507 --> 38:14.248
that can go viral.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.032
Greed can infect
a whole community

38:16.076 --> 38:18.339
if certain conditions
encourage it and...What he's saying

38:18.383 --> 38:19.906
is that most people wouldn't
kill for a million dollars,

38:19.949 --> 38:21.299
but if someone
put a winning lottery ticket

38:21.342 --> 38:23.301
in your hand and there
was only one obstacle

38:23.344 --> 38:26.304
in your way...Look at you
with the behavioral context.

38:26.347 --> 38:28.958
Just for the record, I could not
have cracked this one

38:29.002 --> 38:31.352
without the thorough plodding
of my partner.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.180
Oh, and Officer Clark
was an asset.

38:33.223 --> 38:34.529
He really came through.

38:34.573 --> 38:35.965
I think we should bring him up
on the squad.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.532
Of course you do.
He's just like you were

38:37.576 --> 38:40.361
when you started out:
overeager, overachiever.

38:40.405 --> 38:43.277
She just wants someone else
to boss around.Okay, okay.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.844
I may have been hard on him,

38:44.887 --> 38:46.367
but I think that
Zack is the kind

38:46.411 --> 38:47.629
of new blood we
need around here,

38:47.673 --> 38:50.153
a cop who still wants
to change the world.

38:50.197 --> 38:52.199
I'll think about it.

38:53.374 --> 38:55.420
Don't you have
a train to catch?

38:55.463 --> 38:57.770
Oh, no, I canceled on
my father hours ago.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.337
The trip was with your dad?

38:59.380 --> 39:01.164
Mm

39:01.208 --> 39:02.775
Oh, he's used to it.

39:02.818 --> 39:05.430
I've been disappointing him
since the day I was born.

39:05.473 --> 39:07.606
Long story?
Oh, ongoing.

39:07.649 --> 39:09.390
But I'm starting to
be okay with the fact

39:09.434 --> 39:10.696
that we're very different men.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.262
I'm more about the hunt.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.395
My father is all about the kill.ZACK: Excuse me.

39:14.439 --> 39:15.701
Someone's waiting to see you.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.927
I, uh...

39:24.971 --> 39:26.973
I didn't want
to go home without, um...

39:27.016 --> 39:28.496
thanking the both of you.

39:28.540 --> 39:31.412
You're so welcome.
No one does this.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.328
Yeah, I'm, uh...
I'm gonna be glad to get home.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.113
I'm never gonna complain
about that neighborhood again.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.638
I might even get used
to the, uh, bulldozers.

39:40.552 --> 39:42.118
Thank you, guys.

39:42.162 --> 39:43.511
So long.

39:43.555 --> 39:46.427
LIZZIE: Hey, um,
wait a minute.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.298
I have...

39:48.342 --> 39:51.780
something you might like.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.392
Stan's bodega.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.481
Mm-hmm. Take care.

40:00.049 --> 40:03.575
You gave him your memento.I did.

40:03.618 --> 40:05.707
What will I cling to now?

40:05.751 --> 40:07.405
Just so you know, I don't think

40:07.448 --> 40:09.885
you ever have to give up
your idealism.

40:09.929 --> 40:11.234
Oh, I don't know.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.498
I hear you can't live
in the past.

40:13.541 --> 40:14.803
But why would you want to

40:14.847 --> 40:17.545
when the present
looks so auspicious?

40:19.112 --> 40:22.463
I was-I was referring
to our partnership.

40:22.507 --> 40:24.073
Oh, but we're not partners.

40:24.117 --> 40:25.466
I'm your boss.
