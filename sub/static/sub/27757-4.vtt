00:07.835 --> 00:09.877
(woman sobbing softly)

00:11.877 --> 00:14.126
(sobbing continues)

00:15.377 --> 00:17.126
(door bell rings)

00:22.043 --> 00:23.752
(door bell rings)

00:31.752 --> 00:33.460
(door bell rings)

00:39.251 --> 00:41.377
(door bell ringing)

00:41.460 --> 00:43.710
(truck backup alarms
beeping outside)

00:45.085 --> 00:47.251
(voices murmuring outside)

00:51.126 --> 00:53.251
Jed (sing-songy):
Good morning, Eustace.

00:53.335 --> 00:55.377
I hope our trucks
didn't wake you,

00:55.460 --> 00:57.460
but I just wanted to let you
know we're about to start up,

00:57.543 --> 00:59.794
and I got you and Horace
some coffee.

01:00.627 --> 01:02.460
-Are you okay?
-(sobbing)

01:02.543 --> 01:04.543
Oh my God!
Eustace, mama!

01:04.627 --> 01:06.210
Girl, what's going on?
Talk to me.

01:06.293 --> 01:08.835
-Man: A little bit more.
-(Eustace sobbing)

01:08.919 --> 01:12.043
Jed:
Girl, I don't--
I don't know what to do.

01:12.126 --> 01:14.543
Gloria: Elbows up.
You're gonna fan your heart.

01:14.627 --> 01:16.377
Breath of fire.

01:16.460 --> 01:17.877
Don't look at me
like that, just--

01:17.960 --> 01:20.752
You know it. That's it.

01:20.835 --> 01:23.877
Keep going, you're gonna take it
a little longer than you like.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.251
Mm-hmm.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.418
Remember:

01:27.502 --> 01:31.001
No matter how comfortable
you initially feel,

01:31.085 --> 01:35.168
everything eventually
becomes uncomfortable.

01:35.251 --> 01:37.293
That's why we have
divorce lawyers.

01:38.377 --> 01:40.251
Seventy-five percent
of marriage,

01:40.335 --> 01:41.919
a long marriage that is,

01:42.001 --> 01:44.210
is basically Stockholm syndrome.

01:45.418 --> 01:47.085
I feel bad for you guys.
Let's do this.

01:47.168 --> 01:50.251
It's like a little bit of
a mula bundha  airing out,
you know.

01:50.335 --> 01:52.919
Like, so a little ch-ch-ch.
Like more like chu-chu-chu.

01:53.001 --> 01:54.460
Yeah, that's it.
Chu-chu-chu-chu.

01:54.543 --> 01:57.043
No, it's good that he's not
there anymore, you know?

01:57.126 --> 01:59.168
-Right.
-But now we literally
have to reshoot

01:59.251 --> 02:02.168
every scene with some
new actor, you know.

02:02.251 --> 02:03.960
Tell me
it's Colin Farrell.

02:04.043 --> 02:05.794
(laughs)
No. I wish.

02:05.877 --> 02:09.418
No, it's like, they ended up
with some guy named Tom--

02:09.502 --> 02:11.919
-What's his name?
Something--
-(phone chimes)

02:12.001 --> 02:14.210
One mention of Colin's name
and I'm wet.

02:14.293 --> 02:17.335
Oh, shit. Looks like
I'm late for work.

02:17.418 --> 02:19.710
Hey, good morning, Jemima.

02:19.794 --> 02:23.293
Morning, Chrinty.
I know I'm late. Relax.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.794
Oh, you're fine.
We still got a little time.

02:25.877 --> 02:28.085
What we're gonna do now is,
we're gonna get you

02:28.168 --> 02:29.543
-in the wardrobe truck.
-Yep.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.710
And we'll come and grab you
when we're ready for you.

02:31.794 --> 02:35.752
-Would you like breakfast?
-Yes, I'm gonna do that right
now and just swing by crafty.

02:35.835 --> 02:38.126
Okay, well, I can actually
get that for you.

02:38.210 --> 02:39.710
No, that's fine.
I'm gonna just get it,

02:39.794 --> 02:41.126
-and pick my own food.
-Please.

02:41.210 --> 02:43.752
-I'll grab it and--
-No, I don't trust you, so...

02:43.835 --> 02:47.418
-All right.
-(whistles) Hey! Yo!

02:47.502 --> 02:49.710
We're not shutting down today.
It's tomorrow.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.460
Yeah, I'm just here
responding to a call

02:51.543 --> 02:53.960
about a death
in the building.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.919
My bad, I thought you
were our guy. I'm sorry.

02:58.210 --> 02:59.919
Did that cop just say
someone died?

03:00.001 --> 03:01.126
I don't know
what that's about.

03:01.210 --> 03:02.543
Each chapter is, like,
what I cook,

03:02.627 --> 03:04.418
right before they shot
your favorite scenes.

03:04.502 --> 03:06.877
That's a great idea, man.
How many chapters have
you written so far?

03:06.960 --> 03:09.251
Well, right now I got
a bunch of voice memos,

03:09.335 --> 03:13.418
but I'm definitely committing it
to paper very soon.

03:13.502 --> 03:15.126
You have so much access
just from being on set.

03:15.210 --> 03:18.085
-Hey, Sunshine!
-Hi, Eddie. How are you?

03:18.168 --> 03:19.835
You know me!

03:19.919 --> 03:22.335
-Hey, can I make
you something?
-No, I'm good.

03:22.418 --> 03:24.377
You already made my day.

03:25.710 --> 03:27.335
My name's not Eddie.

03:27.919 --> 03:30.377
I didn't want to say anything
during principal photography,

03:30.460 --> 03:33.377
but when I was in college,
I saw you in a Pinkberry

03:33.460 --> 03:35.335
and you looked really happy.

03:35.418 --> 03:37.627
No, not possible.

03:40.543 --> 03:42.627
-Hi.
-Hey, Jemima.

03:42.710 --> 03:45.126
-Good to see you. Good.
-Hey, how are you sweetheart?

03:45.210 --> 03:48.085
Sorry, you know,
we're running a little
behind this morning.

03:48.168 --> 03:49.877
-Okay.
-So, you wanna come back?

03:49.960 --> 03:52.335
Um, all right, I guess
I'll just leave these here.

03:52.418 --> 03:55.377
I wanted to wear these
today in the scene

03:55.460 --> 03:56.752
instead of the other ones.

03:56.835 --> 03:58.335
-Oh my God, they're fab!
-Aren't they good?

03:58.418 --> 03:59.960
-Yeah!
-They're very '60s.

04:00.043 --> 04:03.251
Yeah. You know, the only thing
I'm worried about is continuity,

04:03.335 --> 04:06.210
because we just saw you leave
the house in those other shoes.

04:06.293 --> 04:08.835
Yeah, I don't know,
maybe we could just
shoot another scene

04:08.919 --> 04:10.794
where I go shopping
and buy those.

04:10.877 --> 04:14.293
-It's just that the other
ones are so uncomfortable.
-Yeah. Yeah, I mean--

04:14.377 --> 04:16.460
But I don't really
know if that--

04:16.543 --> 04:18.752
They never even
shot my feet, so...

04:18.835 --> 04:20.585
-Yeah, um, okay.
-Okay.

04:20.669 --> 04:24.794
-Let me know when you're ready.
-Yeah, we'll let you know, okay?

04:28.251 --> 04:30.794
They're a little tight.
They're really just riding
my perineum.

04:30.877 --> 04:33.377
-Don't-- don't worry about it.
We can alter it.
-Okay.

04:33.460 --> 04:35.251
And also, I like to wear
my shirts open,

04:35.335 --> 04:37.085
so maybe you could just give me
a wife-beater or something.

04:37.168 --> 04:39.710
-A-frame undershirt.
-Right.

04:39.794 --> 04:41.335
-Hey, Andy.
-Hey, Jess.

04:41.418 --> 04:43.168
-Happy birthday.
-Woman: Thanks, Jess.

04:43.251 --> 04:45.835
-Man:
I don't know where he is.
-Woman: See you guys.

04:46.418 --> 04:49.543
Woman: Over here. Thank you.
Hey, you guys. Good morning.

04:49.627 --> 04:53.085
-Is the body out yet?
-Ken, a man just died.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.794
Yeah, but sitting around
in the apartment crying

04:54.877 --> 04:56.418
isn't gonna bring him
back to life.

04:56.502 --> 04:59.085
But since we can't get back
into that location just yet,

04:59.168 --> 05:00.835
why don't we pull
something else up?

05:00.919 --> 05:03.460
Can't shoot those exteriors,
you have colors like shit
this time of day.

05:03.543 --> 05:06.251
They're just having a meal,
so what if they go out for it?

05:06.335 --> 05:08.001
No. We're...
We're reshooting the actor.

05:08.085 --> 05:09.877
We're not rewriting
the whole fucking story.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.627
Well, maybe it makes
the story better.

05:11.710 --> 05:14.794
Actually, there's
a really cool-looking bar
right here in holding.

05:14.877 --> 05:17.543
Wouldn't hurt for us
to just check it out.

05:19.627 --> 05:21.752
All right.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Let's go see it.

05:21.835 --> 05:23.960
-Let's go.
-Cecily: Okay.
Let's take a look.

05:24.543 --> 05:27.877
Gigi, do you want
any coffee or snacks
or iced tea?

05:27.960 --> 05:30.293
Oh, I would love
an iced tea.

05:30.377 --> 05:32.627
All right.
Also, wardrobe
needs approvals.

05:32.710 --> 05:33.960
Approvals?
It's a reshoot.

05:34.043 --> 05:35.585
Well, Jemima doesn't
like her shoes,

05:35.669 --> 05:37.585
and I, I think the guy
lied about his sizes.

05:37.669 --> 05:40.335
-Okay, you can politely
tell Jemima to fuck off.
-Right.

05:40.418 --> 05:42.460
We already have enough
continuity problems
on this film.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.669
-I will get that iced tea.
-Hey, Jemima!

05:44.752 --> 05:46.502
-Hi! Hey.
-Hey.

05:46.585 --> 05:48.418
-Oh, it's so good
to have you back.
-Thank you.

05:48.502 --> 05:51.168
And thanks for not
making me cut my hair.

05:51.251 --> 05:54.627
God, I just really
didn't want to.

05:54.710 --> 05:58.335
Yeah, no worries.
She is a wonder with wigs.

05:58.418 --> 05:59.710
I am.

05:59.794 --> 06:02.335
Did you prepare an agenda
for the safety meeting later?

06:02.418 --> 06:04.835
Oh, no, sorry.
We should check with Tommie.

06:04.919 --> 06:06.335
-Oh, no.
Yeah, I'll check.
-Okay.

06:06.418 --> 06:08.835
Jemima, thank you
so much for doing this.

06:08.919 --> 06:10.835
Anything you need,
you let me know.

06:10.919 --> 06:13.418
-Jemima: I promise you,
it was shorter, just a little.
-Let me check the photos.

06:13.502 --> 06:16.335
No, no, no, no!
That's the only one I have!

06:16.835 --> 06:18.752
Cecily: I don't know,
I have to talk to the building,

06:18.835 --> 06:22.960
but they do advertise
this as a place "Where
all your dreams come true!"

06:23.043 --> 06:24.752
Barry: Look, I know
we have enough extras

06:24.835 --> 06:26.543
that we can definitely
fill the space.

06:26.627 --> 06:28.377
-We could make it look
mad moody in here.
-Moody's good.

06:28.460 --> 06:30.960
-Ken, you like moody.
-Yeah, but they would
never eat here.

06:31.043 --> 06:33.377
This looks like a place
that you would come
for some fucking schnitzel.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.210
It's sort of giving me
Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?  vibes,

06:36.293 --> 06:38.210
-but maybe that's
not a bad thing.
-Ken: No, no, no.

06:38.293 --> 06:39.752
-Come on.
Let's keep looking.
-Sy: Hey, Ken.

06:39.835 --> 06:41.710
Sorry to bother you,
but extras is really
pushing me

06:41.794 --> 06:44.210
to see if any of these
would work as photos...

06:44.293 --> 06:46.377
Did you bring an agenda
for the safety meeting?

06:46.460 --> 06:49.293
No, but I'm gonna
need one.

06:50.168 --> 06:51.710
These kids can only
work four hours each,

06:51.794 --> 06:54.377
including travel,
so a set of twins
and a set of triplets

06:54.460 --> 06:56.377
should cover us
for the entire day.

06:56.460 --> 06:58.293
But these kids are
all wrong. I mean, look.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.043
The twins have
game show host hair,

07:00.126 --> 07:01.710
and the triplets look
like they're premies.

07:01.794 --> 07:04.418
-Maybe the twins
will shave their heads?
-Can we ask for that?

07:04.502 --> 07:07.335
-I mean...
-Ask, fine.
Shave the twins. Perfect.

07:07.418 --> 07:10.627
-We're fucked.
-Ken, nothing's fucked.
We're working it out.

07:10.710 --> 07:12.585
This is a beautiful room.

07:12.669 --> 07:15.001
It's totally wrong. I mean,
look at all the wood paneling.

07:15.085 --> 07:16.835
It's like where I had
my bar mitzvah,

07:16.919 --> 07:19.794
or-- or like The Shining  .
It's haunted, I think.

07:19.877 --> 07:22.919
-Both had twins.
-It kind of reminds me
of The Deer Hunter  .

07:23.001 --> 07:26.669
-You can't make movies
that slow anymore.
-No, you can't.

07:28.293 --> 07:30.794
Okay, guys,
we're two hours behind.

07:30.877 --> 07:32.585
Oh! What if they eat outside?

07:32.669 --> 07:33.919
Cecily:
Okay! They have an outside here.

07:34.001 --> 07:37.001
It's a biergarten  .
It's right out here.

07:37.085 --> 07:39.752
-Tommie: Okay, much less rococo.
-Cecily: Right?

07:39.835 --> 07:44.126
-A little more like
pan-Asian, Germano-confused.
-(siren wailing, horn blares)

07:44.210 --> 07:46.085
Ken:
This is a sound nightmare.

07:46.168 --> 07:48.460
It's a fucking
highway out there.
Are you kidding me?

07:48.543 --> 07:51.752
And the scene after it
says it's a rainy night,
it's supposed to be a raining.

07:51.835 --> 07:53.960
-We can make it rain.
-No, that's special equipment.

07:54.043 --> 07:55.335
I can't get that
on short notice.

07:55.418 --> 07:57.460
-Okay, we can do a wet down.
-Ken: A wet down?

07:57.543 --> 07:58.794
Nobody eats outside in the rain.

07:58.877 --> 08:01.377
I mean, there's like
a beer garden over here.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.502
It's literally
a German biergarten  .

08:03.585 --> 08:05.919
It's like a teriyaki
fucking biergarten  .

08:06.001 --> 08:07.585
It makes no sense at all.

08:07.669 --> 08:10.043
Okay, you know what, there's
another location upstairs,

08:10.126 --> 08:12.126
and it's a little less
ethnically confused.

08:12.210 --> 08:13.794
I don't know.
I-- I-- I don't know.

08:13.877 --> 08:16.335
I mean, where the fuck is
this gazebo supposed to be?

08:16.418 --> 08:18.251
-In the backyard of the house.
-Ken: What house?

08:18.335 --> 08:21.126
-There's no... no house.
-Barry: We can put
a green screen back here.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.126
You can have whatever you want.
You can have a house,
more gazebos.

08:24.210 --> 08:26.502
You can have a doghouse
with a cat inside of it.

08:26.585 --> 08:28.502
Yeah, I could get you
a green screen.

08:28.585 --> 08:30.919
-Ken: What do you think, D?
-I'm not crazy about
the green screen,

08:31.001 --> 08:32.877
but we can make it work.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.752
-(bee buzzing)
-Whoa! Uh-uh.

08:34.835 --> 08:37.919
-(buzzing)
-Aah! Uh-uh! Uh-uh...

08:39.293 --> 08:40.543
I'm allergic.

08:40.627 --> 08:42.460
Okay, should
we call the crew,
do a rehearsal?

08:42.543 --> 08:45.752
-Yeah, call the crew.
-Okay, great job, everybody.

08:46.168 --> 08:48.835
No. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Just stop.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.752
Can we just put the brakes on

08:50.835 --> 08:52.460
and talk about this
over lunch, please?

08:52.543 --> 08:55.543
-We have the mandatory
meeting at lunch.
-Oh, shit. I forgot.

08:55.627 --> 08:58.835
-(buzzing continues)
-Freakin' out. Freakin' out.
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

08:58.919 --> 09:01.460
And I'm sitting there,
stuck at the airport,

09:01.543 --> 09:06.335
getting a call from this very
junior colleague at the firm,

09:06.418 --> 09:09.794
and she's telling me that
one of these senior partners

09:09.877 --> 09:14.293
tried to show her
a pornographic YouTube clip.

09:14.377 --> 09:18.001
And I mean, guys, don't do that.
Just don't do that.

09:18.085 --> 09:23.627
And now here's this fat,
slovenly, just disgus--

09:23.710 --> 09:27.919
an old man thinking,
"Ah, the cat's away!"

09:28.418 --> 09:31.752
So now I have to call
this colleague and tell him,

09:31.835 --> 09:34.418
"You know, hey, pal.
Times are different.

09:34.502 --> 09:38.293
"You can't just go around
showing porno to a...

09:38.377 --> 09:42.335
"beautiful young woman
just minding her business.

09:42.418 --> 09:45.460
"Next time you want to get
your ya-ya's out, call me.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.251
We'll go to a strip club
or whatever."

09:49.335 --> 09:51.043
You know, times are different.

09:51.126 --> 09:53.293
So, you say you're getting
some headaches?

09:53.377 --> 09:55.085
The Guy:
Yeah, sure.
I get a headache.

09:55.168 --> 09:56.710
I got a headache, yeah.

09:56.794 --> 10:00.835
And, um, maybe also you're
experiencing some nausea?

10:00.919 --> 10:04.919
Maybe, yeah.
Nausea, sure.

10:05.001 --> 10:07.543
You also have anxiety, hmm?

10:07.627 --> 10:09.418
Yeah, I have anxiety,

10:09.502 --> 10:12.877
and these are not the droids
we're looking for.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.168
Oh, all right then.

10:14.251 --> 10:16.085
It seems like
the course of action here

10:16.168 --> 10:18.794
is to prescribe you some
cannabis for your pain.

10:18.877 --> 10:21.960
Um... Seth over there
will set you up.

10:25.043 --> 10:26.502
Wait, that's... it?

10:26.585 --> 10:30.126
I don't have to have, like,
glaucoma or cancer?

10:30.210 --> 10:32.460
-Or anything?
- Do you have glaucoma?

10:32.543 --> 10:33.794
No.

10:33.877 --> 10:36.251
- Do you have problems
with your sight?
-No.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.877
Call me if something's
wrong, you know.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.210
-All right.
-All right.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.168
Thanks, Dr. Larry.

10:43.251 --> 10:44.543
Seth:
Thanks, Dr. Larry.

10:44.627 --> 10:46.377
(Dr. Larry grunts)

10:47.919 --> 10:50.960
Seth: So, you can choose
the dosage you'd like
to receive,

10:51.043 --> 10:53.085
but I'm gonna need you
to fill out these forms

10:53.168 --> 10:54.627
for the New York
Board of Health,

10:54.710 --> 10:58.418
and then I'll need
the $200 cash
for the referral.

10:59.752 --> 11:02.126
Woman:
How have
you been feeling?

11:02.210 --> 11:06.126
Yeah, I've just been, like,
irritable and fatigued.

11:06.210 --> 11:09.794
Those are all
very typical symptoms
after early pregnancy loss.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.502
Are you still using the herbs
and the castor oil packs?

11:12.585 --> 11:15.335
-Yep.
-Good, I'd like you to keep
using those through the week,

11:15.418 --> 11:17.293
and I'm gonna send you home
with a couple of other ones

11:17.377 --> 11:19.919
-I'd like you to take.
Okay, there you go.
-(sighing)

11:20.001 --> 11:22.919
Lee:
I'm just super sensitive.
Do you mind double-checking?

11:23.001 --> 11:24.710
-Waitress: Sure, no problem.
-All right.

11:24.794 --> 11:26.919
(customers chattering)

11:28.335 --> 11:30.585
(instrumental music playing
over speakers)

11:54.418 --> 11:59.502
All right.
There you go, yeah.

12:01.794 --> 12:03.794
(sighing)

12:05.293 --> 12:06.460
You can come in.

12:11.168 --> 12:13.460
(sighing)

12:14.251 --> 12:16.710
All right, so everything
on this table is mine,

12:16.794 --> 12:21.335
but that's not all of it.
I'm gonna keep adding to it.

12:22.126 --> 12:26.126
You can just start
setting up those boxes.

12:26.919 --> 12:28.126
God damn it.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.585
Uh, help yourself
to banana bread.

12:31.669 --> 12:33.001
Thank you.

12:44.293 --> 12:45.960
Well, that's dead.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.043
He was supposed to do this!

12:52.835 --> 12:54.794
He was supposed to do this.

12:57.001 --> 13:00.085
Okay, um... I'm just
gonna start upstairs.

13:00.168 --> 13:03.502
-I'll be back. Just, um...
-Okay, no problem.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.210
Hmm.

13:31.669 --> 13:33.710
What are you doing?

13:33.794 --> 13:35.085
(phone bloops)

13:38.043 --> 13:39.377
(phone bloops)

13:42.752 --> 13:43.877
(phone bloops)

13:56.502 --> 13:59.460
Oh! Yo-yo-yo! Hey, hey!

13:59.543 --> 14:00.794
Picture cars park over here.

14:00.877 --> 14:03.418
-Okay.
-Turn around.
I'll move the cones.

14:03.502 --> 14:06.752
-Come on.
-All right, I won't
say no to that.

14:08.960 --> 14:12.085
(horn honking)

14:12.168 --> 14:14.168
The Guy:
I gave you a hybrid
and a sativa.

14:14.251 --> 14:17.168
-Perfect. Mm-hmm.
-Two pre-rolls, that's $30.

14:17.251 --> 14:18.502
Okay.

14:18.585 --> 14:20.168
How's your day going?

14:20.251 --> 14:23.126
Oh, we are so behind.
It's a little nuts.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.043
-What's the project called?
- Violations.

14:26.126 --> 14:29.877
Violations?
Have I-- Is that the--

14:29.960 --> 14:32.877
-Yeah, he's gone.
We recast that role.
-Oh man.

14:32.960 --> 14:37.335
Listen, you wanna stop by crafty
before you go, be my guest.

14:37.418 --> 14:40.168
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.
Get what you need.

14:40.669 --> 14:42.210
Adrian:
What time is it
during this scene?

14:42.293 --> 14:44.210
-Ken: For what?
-Their phones.

14:44.293 --> 14:45.794
You're not gonna
see their phones.

14:45.877 --> 14:48.502
Okay, but you also just kind of
want to know what time it is.

14:48.585 --> 14:50.835
Uh, like 3:30, I guess.

14:50.919 --> 14:52.251
They're eating lunch?

14:52.335 --> 14:54.710
-It's a late lunch.
It really doesn't matter.
-Okay.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.794
-(women chattering)
-Ken: What?

14:56.877 --> 14:59.627
-Oh, hey! Jemima!
-Hi. How you doing?

14:59.710 --> 15:01.251
It's great to...
great to see you.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.710
-Just-- just go for it.
-Yeah.

15:02.794 --> 15:05.669
It's so good to see you. And
Tom, I can't thank you enough.

15:05.752 --> 15:06.960
-No, please.
-Seriously.

15:07.043 --> 15:09.710
-Happy to be here.
-Like, really, thank you.

15:09.794 --> 15:11.377
Why don't you guys come on in.

15:11.460 --> 15:13.543
-I'll show you the play space.
-That's weird.

15:13.627 --> 15:16.460
This is a gazebo that we've
been looking at for a while,

15:16.543 --> 15:18.877
and it's really good,
so just come on up.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.543
This is whole thing is
basically gonna play out here.

15:22.627 --> 15:24.585
-Jemima, you'll be
sitting over there.
-Uh-huh.

15:24.669 --> 15:26.877
-And, Tom, you over here.
-Okay.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.752
And it's pretty much--
you'll say all the stuff

15:28.835 --> 15:32.293
about the art world
and just get that out.

15:32.377 --> 15:34.669
Then the meal will start,
and it's, "Blah, blah, blah."

15:34.752 --> 15:36.877
Are we sticking to the lines
or can we mad-lib?

15:36.960 --> 15:39.669
Uh, you know what,
I would say first go around,

15:39.752 --> 15:41.251
why don't you just
stay with the script.

15:41.335 --> 15:43.085
-Then, improvise all you want.
-Great. Yeah.

15:43.168 --> 15:45.001
-Just hit the major notes.
-I'm sorry, it's just--

15:45.085 --> 15:46.460
-Yeah?
-Can I just--

15:46.543 --> 15:48.377
-An actor has an idea.
-No, no, no...

15:48.460 --> 15:50.794
-I'm sorry, I have an idea.
-Don't worry about it.

15:51.460 --> 15:53.085
Are you sure
we're being discreet?

15:53.168 --> 15:54.919
It's fine. You do this
every time, Deb.

15:55.001 --> 15:57.460
Just let me be cautious, okay?
I like the way I am.

15:57.543 --> 15:58.919
Oh, come on!

15:59.001 --> 16:02.293
-Let's just smoke in here.
-No, no. That's crazy.

16:02.377 --> 16:05.251
No. Ceilings are
high enough.
Fuck it.

16:06.794 --> 16:08.543
Chrinty:
I've got eyes on Gigi.

16:09.710 --> 16:12.752
Tommie:
What the fuck? It's fine.
She's just a PA.

16:12.835 --> 16:15.335
-She works for you.
-I am trying to maintain

16:15.418 --> 16:18.126
an illusion of
professionalism on set.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.543
Can we just smoke
away from the narcs?

16:22.543 --> 16:24.377
Chrinty:
Gigi is on the move.

16:24.460 --> 16:27.794
So, what if I start--
I'll start the line here.

16:27.877 --> 16:31.126
You know, just give it a little
room, and then I get up,

16:31.210 --> 16:33.460
and she's saying the lines,
she says it slowly.

16:33.543 --> 16:35.835
And maybe she, like,
dawdles over here,

16:35.919 --> 16:38.126
because...
maybe we'll put a bar.

16:38.210 --> 16:40.543
-Yeah, of course.
-And that motivates
her to be like--

16:40.627 --> 16:43.126
-to say the rest of her--
"I hate you"
-Yeah.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.710
Or whatever the line,
you know.

16:44.794 --> 16:48.335
-I think that--
-And then she makes
a drink, and then...

16:48.960 --> 16:52.001
Uh-huh, that makes sense.
So there's-- we'll just--

16:52.085 --> 16:54.585
If there's a bar,
you're gonna have--
then, we'll get you a drink.

16:54.669 --> 16:56.418
Right, right. She comes
over here to get a drink

16:56.502 --> 16:58.168
and then hits him with it

16:58.251 --> 17:01.085
right here instead of
facing away, you know?

17:01.168 --> 17:03.168
Tom:
Right, and if we want
to motivate her exit,

17:03.251 --> 17:04.752
I can get up and come over,

17:04.835 --> 17:07.669
and I don't want to stack her,
I don't know where your lens is.

17:07.752 --> 17:11.794
But I can come up and I can
pantomime making a drink.

17:11.877 --> 17:13.502
-Yeah, mm-hmm.
-And then from here,

17:13.585 --> 17:15.835
she can hit me
with that final line
and that motivates her exit.

17:15.919 --> 17:17.502
Jemima:
That makes sense to me.

17:17.585 --> 17:19.377
I think if you're good
with that, everybody--

17:19.460 --> 17:21.377
-that's much more
straightforward.
-Tom: Yeah, I think.

17:21.460 --> 17:23.001
Thank you. Okay, great.
If you're good to go,

17:23.085 --> 17:25.043
-all we need to do
is get them...
-Barry: A bar?

17:25.126 --> 17:27.168
A bar and maybe
some cocktails, I guess.

17:27.251 --> 17:29.126
So, Darlene?
We good to go?

17:29.210 --> 17:31.752
Yeah, I just need
another minute, need
to set up another light.

17:31.835 --> 17:33.794
Can I get a sky panel
to set, please?

17:33.877 --> 17:37.293
Find a bar.
Like now.

17:37.377 --> 17:38.919
-Thank you.
-She's wearing a green scarf.

17:39.001 --> 17:41.085
(sighing)
It doesn't matter.

17:41.168 --> 17:42.502
All right.

17:42.585 --> 17:45.585
-Deb: I gotta go.
-Oh my God.
I forgot to vote today!

17:45.669 --> 17:47.418
Oh, right!

17:49.085 --> 17:50.710
-Stop!
-What?

17:50.794 --> 17:52.752
-Emergency exit.
-No, it's not.

17:52.835 --> 17:54.251
It says so right there.

17:54.335 --> 17:56.210
It's a deterrent.

17:56.293 --> 17:58.001
Gigi and Deb:
No!

17:58.710 --> 18:01.627
Deb:
Sorry, I've had, like,
80 coffees this morning.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.627
This will work, yeah.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.919
Yeah, no. Uh-uh.
Yeah, no. Fuck this shit.

18:09.001 --> 18:10.752
I'm not getting Zika
while I'm waiting on a reshoot.

18:10.835 --> 18:12.794
It's fine.
They'll hate the smoke.

18:13.669 --> 18:15.293
You guys, we have
to get back to work.

18:15.377 --> 18:17.043
Can we please get stoned?

18:17.126 --> 18:20.168
I was almost a back-up
harmonica for Blues Traveler.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.919
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.502
That's cool.
What happened?

18:23.585 --> 18:25.251
-He didn't want
an understudy.
-Hey!

18:25.335 --> 18:26.877
You gotta move your van.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.710
You're blocking the lift gate
of the G&E truck.

18:28.794 --> 18:29.919
Okay, I'll move it.

18:30.001 --> 18:31.752
This isn't a picture car, is it?

18:31.835 --> 18:34.335
It's a '77 Dodge.

18:38.293 --> 18:41.919
-You lied to me.
-(engine chugging)

18:42.001 --> 18:43.669
Oh, shit.

18:43.752 --> 18:45.460
It does this.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.418
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

18:55.126 --> 18:56.669
Come on, man.

18:59.168 --> 19:02.043
Hey. Yeah, I've got
a one o'clock with Hannah.

19:02.126 --> 19:03.877
Receptionist:
Yeah, of course.
Have a seat.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.460
-Lee.
-Grace, hey!

19:06.543 --> 19:09.043
I literally was just thinking
about you this morning.

19:09.126 --> 19:11.710
I-I just cannot believe that
I'm running into you like this.

19:11.794 --> 19:14.251
-How are you?
-Good. I'm okay. I'm good.

19:14.335 --> 19:16.669
-Greta said that
you moved upstate.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:16.752 --> 19:19.710
-I've got a house in Athens.
-Oh, wow!

19:20.669 --> 19:23.627
You got a lot of love
behind you right now.

19:23.710 --> 19:26.543
Like, I was just talking with
some women that I work with,

19:26.627 --> 19:31.377
and we're all like, "Lee is
really the victim here."

19:31.460 --> 19:34.043
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm not the...

19:34.126 --> 19:36.710
No, no, of course.
But, you know, I mean,

19:36.794 --> 19:39.251
we're always talking about
the people who come forward,

19:39.335 --> 19:43.669
but you know,
we never talk about
the ones who get left behind.

19:43.752 --> 19:45.710
You are very strong.

19:45.794 --> 19:48.001
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

19:48.085 --> 19:49.377
Woman:
Grace?

19:49.835 --> 19:55.043
-I...
-Okay. Really good
to see you. Thank you.

19:55.126 --> 19:56.543
-Yep.
-All right.

19:56.627 --> 19:59.627
You can follow me.
How are you?

20:00.126 --> 20:01.960
(sighs)

20:06.251 --> 20:07.960
Gigi (as Bradley):
I told my colleague,

20:08.043 --> 20:10.460
"If you feel the need to
sexually assault your coworker,

"just don't do it.

20:12.877 --> 20:15.043
Call me, we'll get
a hooker together."

20:15.126 --> 20:17.710
"She was a young, sexy,
supple woman.

20:17.794 --> 20:21.418
She didn't deserve to be raped
by that fat, nasty ogre."

20:22.418 --> 20:24.001
Where did you find that guy?

20:24.085 --> 20:25.919
He was recommended
by my divorce lawyer.

20:26.001 --> 20:27.877
Look, we needed to do that,
whatever that was.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.085
Especially on this set,
but, you know,

20:30.168 --> 20:32.126
I think there's a cottage
industry rising out of this.

20:32.210 --> 20:34.168
-Oh my God.
That couple's fighting.
-What?

20:34.251 --> 20:36.001
-Aw, don't fight.
-GiGi: Where?

20:36.085 --> 20:38.335

That was a murder.
That was a murder.

20:42.627 --> 20:44.960
-Tommie, get down!
-Oh my God! Call 9-1-1.

20:45.043 --> 20:47.001
No, you know what,
I'm gonna call my assistant.

20:47.085 --> 20:48.460
She's gonna call 9-1-1.

20:48.543 --> 20:50.669
-Oh my God.
-It's okay. Everybody breathe.

20:50.752 --> 20:52.710
Aah shit. They're doing
last looks, guys.

20:52.794 --> 20:55.126

21:43.919 --> 21:46.460
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:46.543 --> 21:51.377
-What happened?
-New York... happened.

21:52.293 --> 21:53.919
She got me.

21:54.001 --> 21:56.710
-She gets ya,
but then she gets ya.
-Yeah.

21:56.794 --> 21:59.669

22:14.835 --> 22:16.502
How was your day?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.835
Well, you'll never guess
where I delivered.

22:18.919 --> 22:22.001
-Where?
- Violations.

22:22.085 --> 22:24.585
-No.
-Yeah, I was on set.

22:24.669 --> 22:26.377
-What?
-Yeah.

22:26.460 --> 22:28.335
Can you believe it?
I was.

22:28.418 --> 22:30.043
-I don't believe you.
-I really was.

22:30.126 --> 22:34.585
-Actually, I do. Wow.
-Jesus. Small fucking world.

22:35.835 --> 22:37.960
So, I don't know.

22:38.043 --> 22:42.418
It's tempting, but...
LA isn't any different
if you think about it.

22:42.502 --> 22:45.794
It's annoyingly still
a small town somehow.

22:45.877 --> 22:48.085
I'd still be that woman
who was married to that guy

22:48.168 --> 22:50.001
who did all those
gross things.

23:46.669 --> 23:48.752
I'm just gonna go ahead and talk
to your actors real quick.

23:48.835 --> 23:50.502
Oh, we're just gonna
finish this scene up,

23:50.585 --> 23:52.043
and then you can do
whatever you need to do.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.126
Sure, of course.
I'll be here till wrap.

23:54.210 --> 23:56.043
Okay, that's great.
Thank you.

23:58.418 --> 24:01.752
Oh, hey. I hear
you had a safety meeting
without me. Not fair.

24:01.835 --> 24:04.335
Oh, you didn't miss
anything.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.543
Jess, whatever happened
to my iced tea?

-Ten breaths!

24:24.835 --> 24:26.335
All right.
Yep, I always forget that.

24:26.418 --> 24:29.251

-Did we wrap the medic?

25:08.293 --> 25:10.752
I was making six figures.

25:10.835 --> 25:13.168
I was comfortable,
but I didn't feel alive.

25:13.251 --> 25:15.502
And, hey, you know,
no time wasted.

25:15.585 --> 25:17.418
If you hadn't become
a doctor,

25:17.502 --> 25:19.710
you would have never
got the set medic gig.

25:19.794 --> 25:20.835
That's true.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.460
And being on set
does make me feel alive.
