00:01.064 --> 00:02.820
So what do you say, Riley?

00:06.718 --> 00:07.759
Will you marry me?

00:12.489 --> 00:14.756
- We need water! Somebody get water!
- Here, here, here.

00:14.791 --> 00:15.757
Oh.

00:18.811 --> 00:21.780
Thank . I was so thirsty.

00:21.831 --> 00:24.683
Riley, can you hear me? Are you all right?

00:24.685 --> 00:25.734
Oh, my god.

00:25.768 --> 00:27.536
What happened?

00:27.587 --> 00:30.656
Oh, gosh. It was amazing.
Let me fill you in.

00:30.658 --> 00:34.409
You ruined my wedding!
That's what happened!

00:34.444 --> 00:37.896
You hit the deck! I haven't seen
a girl go down like that since...

00:37.898 --> 00:39.798
It's probably not for right now.

00:40.934 --> 00:42.434
Do you remember anything?

00:42.436 --> 00:45.871
Yeah, um, Ben was marrying
your mom and Brad.

00:45.905 --> 00:48.840
And how that story ends.

00:48.842 --> 00:50.642
What else?

00:52.845 --> 00:54.730
You kissed me.

00:54.781 --> 00:57.599
Oh, you took me in your
arms and you kissed me.

00:57.634 --> 00:59.535
And then?

00:59.569 --> 01:01.470
I kissed you back.

01:03.573 --> 01:06.475
What? Was there more? Did I miss something?

01:08.461 --> 01:09.795
Uh, no, that was it.

01:10.897 --> 01:12.781
Oh, my god.

Okay, Brad, Brad, Brad,
sweetie, are you okay?

01:35.738 --> 01:37.856
I think so. Oh, god, what happened?

01:37.858 --> 01:40.859
Oh, gosh, it was amazing.
Let me fill you in.

01:40.861 --> 01:44.780
These two idiot ruined my wedding!

01:44.831 --> 01:46.832
I'm sorry. It's a *** thing.

01:46.866 --> 01:49.751
When I get excited, I head-butt people.

01:49.786 --> 01:51.703
Six times.

01:51.754 --> 01:53.755
Six times I have worn this dress,

01:53.790 --> 01:55.874
and six times come back single!

01:55.876 --> 01:57.709
We said we were sorry.

01:57.711 --> 02:01.380
Yeah, well, even Danny
got to marry Brad once.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.714
I wanna marry Brad.

02:02.716 --> 02:05.717
When do I get to marry Brad?

02:05.768 --> 02:08.387
Seriously, Bon-Bon, it's fine.
Look, I'm fine.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.689
So not about you right now, honey.

02:10.723 --> 02:12.724
Should I at least cancel the brunch?

02:12.775 --> 02:14.693
No, cancel my family.

02:14.727 --> 02:16.728
I am having brunch.

02:16.779 --> 02:19.815
Oh, I am having everyone's brunch!

02:22.785 --> 02:24.820
And I might as well go to work.

02:24.871 --> 02:27.406
Hey, do you guys have a
sling that I could borrow?

02:27.408 --> 02:28.790
I told work that I was in a train wreck,

02:28.825 --> 02:30.876
which is actually pretty true.

02:30.910 --> 02:34.413
Hey, need any help
getting out of that dress?

02:34.415 --> 02:36.882
Oh, no. These are just
buttons. I do it all the... Ah.

02:36.916 --> 02:40.886
Got it. Right. Buttons can be tricky, so...

02:42.889 --> 02:45.757
Dude, I can't believe that
you're so cool with that.

02:45.808 --> 02:48.760
I wasn't at first, but
a little soul searching,

02:48.811 --> 02:51.430
ton of anonymous hook-ups, and
a fair amount of liquor later,

02:51.432 --> 02:54.850
I think I'm finally okay with my
brother dating the girl of my dreams.

02:54.901 --> 02:56.818
So you're dead inside.

02:56.853 --> 02:59.671
Yeah, pretty much.

02:59.706 --> 03:01.556
Maybe I should just give up on love.

03:01.607 --> 03:03.709
Dude, you just need to meet your Riley.

03:03.711 --> 03:06.528
I did. Her name was Riley.

03:12.502 --> 03:13.552
Sorry, I'm going up.

03:13.554 --> 03:14.853
Oh, that's cool.

03:16.456 --> 03:18.390
Because so am I, I'll just...

03:24.781 --> 03:26.648
Normally a guy has to buy me dinner

03:26.683 --> 03:27.733
before I let him get this close.

03:27.784 --> 03:29.618
Sorry.

03:31.637 --> 03:33.655
So, you, uh, you moving in, or...

03:33.706 --> 03:35.507
I am.

03:35.558 --> 03:38.493
Seems a little small now
that I see it in the daylight.

03:38.544 --> 03:39.628
You know, if you put up some posters,

03:39.662 --> 03:41.596
maybe a little paint, I
think it'll look great.

03:43.533 --> 03:44.533
I'm Zoey.

03:44.567 --> 03:46.852
Hi, I'm Zoey. No.

03:46.854 --> 03:49.838
I'm... I'm Ben.
You're Zoey. I'm Ben.

03:49.872 --> 03:52.407
Hi, Zoey. It's me, Ben.

03:52.442 --> 03:54.459
Okay, I think we're clear on who I am.

03:56.846 --> 03:58.663
Nice to meet you, Ben.

04:00.650 --> 04:01.733
Send it back up when you're done?

04:01.784 --> 04:04.636
No, no. Let me help you. Here.

04:04.638 --> 04:08.540
Oh, I'm so sorry!

04:08.574 --> 04:10.475
I am
so...

04:10.526 --> 04:12.577
I hope it's not expensive.

04:17.416 --> 04:18.767
Hey, Tuck.

04:18.801 --> 04:21.435
Do you think it's bad that I'm
starting off my relationship with Riley

04:21.471 --> 04:22.821
- by hiding things from her?
- Oh.

04:26.409 --> 04:28.744
Well, nothing is being
hidden right now. Hello.

04:30.430 --> 04:31.780
I just can't believe that
I've been lying to her

04:31.831 --> 04:32.831
about this whole proposal thing.

04:32.865 --> 04:34.766
But when she said that she didn't remember,

04:34.768 --> 04:36.752
thought, maybe she doesn't need to,

04:36.786 --> 04:38.720
'cause the truth is, it
was just too much too soon.

04:39.772 --> 04:41.623
But now it's been a month,

04:41.657 --> 04:44.476
and I'm gonna do exactly what I
should have done in the first place.

04:46.529 --> 04:48.563
Knock, knock.
Hey... hey.

04:48.598 --> 04:51.550
What lucky half naked man
wants to walk me to work?

04:52.586 --> 04:54.436
I just need another second.

04:54.470 --> 04:56.471
I've got a big surprise planned
for you after work tonight.

04:56.506 --> 04:57.873
You're never gonna guess
where I'm gonna take you.

04:57.924 --> 05:00.392
You gotta meet me on top of
the Empire State Building.

05:02.795 --> 05:05.730
Oh, god. Oh, no. This isn't happening.

05:05.732 --> 05:07.682
He's gonna ask me to
marry him again, isn't he?

05:07.717 --> 05:08.717
Yeah, probab...

05:11.537 --> 05:12.704
Wait a minute. Did you just say, "again"?

05:12.706 --> 05:14.606
He's going to ask you to marry him "again"?

05:16.542 --> 05:18.493
What?

05:18.528 --> 05:19.528
No.

05:19.579 --> 05:22.397
No, I most certainly did not say that.

05:22.431 --> 05:25.450
I knew it. I knew it.
You do remember him proposing.

05:25.501 --> 05:27.853
You didn't know what to say, so you
pretended to faint to get out of it.

05:27.887 --> 05:29.855
Oh my go... Tucker,
I would never...

05:29.889 --> 05:32.424
- Danny...
- Be quiet. Be quiet.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.694
Olay. Okay.

05:35.696 --> 05:36.761
All right, all right. Fine, fine.

05:36.796 --> 05:37.879
I faked it, okay?

05:37.930 --> 05:40.782
That is what women do when
they don't know what to say.

05:41.818 --> 05:44.619
Or they get bored.

05:44.654 --> 05:45.821
Yeah, well, get ready,

05:45.872 --> 05:48.540
because I think he's ready to ask you again.

05:48.574 --> 05:49.658
God, it's too soon.

05:49.692 --> 05:51.710
I mean, I love him I love him,

05:51.712 --> 05:53.495
but it is too soon.

05:54.614 --> 05:56.448
Okay, I'll just...

05:56.532 --> 05:58.550
I'm gonna avoid all romantic situations

05:58.552 --> 06:00.502
and then let him know how happy I am

06:00.536 --> 06:01.786
with the way things are right now,

06:01.838 --> 06:03.772
like, in a subtle way, and...

06:03.806 --> 06:05.774
he'll get that, right?

06:08.778 --> 06:10.662
Oh, my god. Tucker.

06:10.713 --> 06:12.347
Tucker, Tucker, are you okay?

06:12.381 --> 06:13.648
Yeah, yeah. I just got bored.

06:18.554 --> 06:21.506
Mm. Tucker, you were right.

06:21.541 --> 06:22.557
I just needed to meet my Riley,

06:22.592 --> 06:24.559
and I did, right here in the building.

06:24.610 --> 06:25.644
Isn't that crazy?

06:25.695 --> 06:27.546
Are you sure it wasn't the real Riley?

06:27.548 --> 06:29.648
You know, she lives in this building too.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.384
Her name's Zoey, and she's perfect.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.585
You know, maybe I'll
just hang around the lobby

06:33.619 --> 06:35.437
until I accidentally bump into her again.

06:35.471 --> 06:37.856
Oh, hello Zoey. Remember me?

06:37.890 --> 06:39.841
Why, yes, I would like
to make out with you.

06:41.794 --> 06:43.778
Or you could
try something different

06:43.829 --> 06:46.698
like manning up and just
telling her how you feel.

06:47.733 --> 06:49.734
Huh, the truth.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.520
Little unorthodox.

06:52.572 --> 06:53.638
But I've heard girls go crazy for it.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.625
You know what? I'm just
gonna lay it all out there.

06:56.659 --> 06:58.510
Baggage, baby, everything.

07:00.563 --> 07:05.350
So, any of you boys wanna go in drag
this Halloween as a cursed bride?

07:06.452 --> 07:09.354
Brad and I have officially
called off the wedding.

07:09.356 --> 07:10.655
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.

07:10.706 --> 07:12.641
If you wanna talk about it,
Tucker's here for you.

07:13.809 --> 07:16.361
All right, I need you.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.663
I need you. All right, listen to me.

07:18.714 --> 07:20.599
Loo this website

07:20.601 --> 07:22.717
right here and get your
license to marry me and Brad.

07:22.752 --> 07:25.704
But I thought you just said you
were calling off the wedding.

07:25.738 --> 07:28.506
Have you seen Brad? I'm not insane.

07:29.542 --> 07:30.558
I just need

07:30.610 --> 07:33.545
without Tweedle-Dork and
Tweedle-Dumbass being there.

07:33.596 --> 07:35.480
So, ll you help me? Please?

07:36.582 --> 07:37.549
- Sure.
- Okay.

07:39.553 --> 07:42.487
Oh, perfect. Another
9-1-1 from Riley.

07:42.521 --> 07:44.806
Man, white chicks.

07:48.678 --> 07:51.579
Thank God. Look at this.
Look at it. It's horrible.

07:53.766 --> 07:55.533
I mean, it's a little uneven,

07:55.584 --> 07:57.636
but is the thought that counts?

07:57.638 --> 08:00.555
No. Don't you know where this heart leads?

08:00.589 --> 08:02.474
It is just another step
deeper into the vortex

08:02.525 --> 08:05.410
that is my romantic nightmare.
Please, you have to help me.

08:05.461 --> 08:07.345
How can I help you?

08:15.454 --> 08:16.738
Oh, whoa, whoa!

08:21.610 --> 08:22.661
Towel?

08:24.714 --> 08:27.499
Okay, just flash her your pearly whites,

08:27.533 --> 08:29.451
and just let Daddy do the talking, okay?

08:29.485 --> 08:30.568
I love you.

08:30.570 --> 08:34.472
Oh, hey there. It's me, Zoey again. No!

08:34.506 --> 08:36.508
God, it's Ben again.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.511
Um, this is my daughter, Emma.

08:40.546 --> 08:41.830
Uh, yeah, I just needed you to know

08:41.881 --> 08:43.847
that she's part of the package.

08:44.867 --> 08:46.701
What package are we talking about?

08:47.770 --> 08:48.853
Look...

08:48.888 --> 08:50.622
Zoey...

08:50.656 --> 08:53.484
I haven't stopped thinking
about you since we met,

08:53.576 --> 08:55.639
and I think you should
know that I'm a single dad

08:55.739 --> 09:02.026
with a complicated life, who recently
had this hard ***.You get the point...

09:02.126 --> 09:05.045
Would you maybe like to go out with me,

09:05.079 --> 09:06.980
Us, sometime?

09:08.032 --> 09:10.000
Wow, uh...

09:10.051 --> 09:12.352
To be honest, I've been
thinking about you all day too.

09:13.421 --> 09:15.338
But, obviously, this is not a great time.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.973
My life is a bit of a mess.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.958
I just ended this relationship...

09:20.328 --> 09:22.262
An know, as I say it,

09:22.296 --> 09:25.198
we kind of sound perfect for each other.

09:25.249 --> 09:26.299
Are you sure?

09:26.301 --> 09:28.118
I am so sure.

09:28.152 --> 09:31.171
Then, yes, I'd like to go out with you.

09:31.173 --> 09:33.273
Okay, perfect. Tomorrow night at 7:00.

09:33.275 --> 09:35.158
All right. Come here. Come on.

09:37.161 --> 09:41.965
Oh, man I am bringing you along
every time I ask a girl out.

09:43.484 --> 09:46.419
Maybe we won't have to do
this alone after all, baby.

09:50.675 --> 09:53.875
Hey. Just making sure I have everything.

09:53.975 --> 09:56.375
Keys, phone, doctor's number.

09:56.410 --> 09:58.227
Doctor's number?

09:58.261 --> 10:00.279
Well, obviously I could go at any minute.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.181
You're dying?

10:02.215 --> 10:03.265
Damn it, I really liked you.

10:03.317 --> 10:05.251
I'm not dying.

10:05.285 --> 10:07.253
Although, I am counting the minutes until

10:07.255 --> 10:10.022
I can get this baby out of me.

10:10.057 --> 10:10.956
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:12.042 --> 10:13.025
When did that happen?

10:14.061 --> 10:15.961
Pretty sure it the last time I had sex.

10:17.130 --> 10:19.031
Y... y... y...
you're pregnant?

10:19.066 --> 10:21.083
Are you k... k...
k... kidding me?

10:21.118 --> 10:22.351
How did you not notice?

10:22.386 --> 10:23.352
I'm a dude!

10:23.403 --> 10:24.437
We have focus issues.

10:24.471 --> 10:26.422
We tend to concentrate on
the areas directly above

10:26.473 --> 10:28.274
and below the baby zone.

10:28.325 --> 10:30.242
And now that you know, you want to cancel.

10:30.277 --> 10:31.310
Yeah, maybe. Okay.

10:31.345 --> 10:33.162
Yeah, that might be best
if that's what you think.

10:33.196 --> 10:34.163
I think you should get out.

10:34.214 --> 10:35.147
That's probably a good idea.

10:41.304 --> 10:43.039
Tucker, hurry up.

10:43.073 --> 10:44.990
We've got to get out of
here before Ben or Danny

10:44.992 --> 10:45.975
or any of
those guys...

10:48.995 --> 10:50.029
What the hell is going on?

10:50.063 --> 10:51.097
- Uh...
- Um...

10:52.115 --> 10:53.366
We're going dancing.

10:53.417 --> 10:54.383
Yeah.

10:54.418 --> 10:55.384
Because it's Thursday.

10:57.471 --> 10:58.421
It's...

10:58.455 --> 11:00.356
- This is what we do on Thursdays.
- Yeah.

11:00.390 --> 11:02.358
Tah-tah! -It's
just a thing...

11:02.409 --> 11:04.210
that we like to do.

11:04.212 --> 11:05.244
You kn

11:05.278 --> 11:07.279
On Thursdays.

11:07.314 --> 11:09.265
No, I meant what the hell is
going on with the universe?

11:09.299 --> 11:11.117
My date is pregnant.

11:11.151 --> 11:12.151
Again?!

11:12.153 --> 11:14.170
Oh, my god, Ben!

11:14.204 --> 11:15.187
Okay, that's it!

11:15.222 --> 11:17.073
Somebody get me a sewing kit.

11:17.124 --> 11:18.974
Can't be that hard to perform a vasectomy.

11:20.077 --> 11:21.944
This one's not mine!

11:21.978 --> 11:24.397
So, I turned and ran faster
than the kid's real dad.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.033
But I thought you said
there was a connection.

11:28.068 --> 11:30.236
Yeah, well obviously she
connected with someone else

11:30.287 --> 11:31.337
about nine months ago.

11:31.339 --> 11:32.388
Okay, wait, wait.

11:32.439 --> 11:35.374
So this poor girl, who you asked out

11:35.376 --> 11:38.160
and is probably at her most vulnerable,

11:38.195 --> 11:39.261
was just told to her face that

11:39.296 --> 11:41.213
because she's in the
middle of creating a life,

11:41.248 --> 11:43.115
she's not worthy of your attention?

11:43.117 --> 11:45.000
Not in so many words.

11:47.003 --> 11:48.037
What was I supposed to do?

11:48.071 --> 11:50.439
Well, for starters, you
should go to your room

11:50.474 --> 11:53.125
and have a nice long conversation
with yourself about it.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.010
Wait, so you guys are
really gonna go dancing?

11:55.045 --> 11:57.363
- Yeah. It's Thursday. We've gotta dance.
- Yep. Don't follow us. Nope.

12:01.952 --> 12:03.202
Oh! Hi.

12:03.204 --> 12:04.270
I didn't expect you back yet.

12:04.304 --> 12:06.122
Hey. What are you doing in my room?

12:06.156 --> 12:08.257
Just playing with Emma
until her sitter gets here.

12:08.308 --> 12:11.127
Hey, Danny isn't back from
Central Park yet, is he?

12:11.161 --> 12:13.145
If he is, could you, like,
not tell him that I'm in here?

12:13.180 --> 12:14.146
Oh, my god. He knows.

12:15.232 --> 12:17.082
Are you okay?

12:17.134 --> 12:19.051
Yeah, of course I'm okay.

12:19.085 --> 12:20.035
I mean, why wouldn't I be okay?

12:20.070 --> 12:21.036
You know, it's not like I,

12:21.087 --> 12:22.421
you know, pretended to faint at the altar

12:22.423 --> 12:24.006
and said that I didn't hear his proposal

12:24.040 --> 12:25.991
because it was just,
like, too much too soon

12:26.026 --> 12:27.426
and now keeps planning all
these super sweet moments

12:27.461 --> 12:29.311
but I feel ike he's just
gonna keep asking me forever

12:29.346 --> 12:31.947
and it feels like I'm stuck in
some kind of romantic Groundhog Day.

12:33.984 --> 12:35.267
Well, as long as you're okay.

12:36.386 --> 12:38.387
Ben, I don't know what
to do. Tell me what to do.

12:38.421 --> 12:41.207
About my brother who you're in love with

12:41.209 --> 12:42.241
and who you left me for?

12:42.275 --> 12:44.143
I knew you were going to bring that up.

12:46.096 --> 12:49.231
Well, I think I know what you should do.

12:49.282 --> 12:51.167
You should talk to him.

12:51.201 --> 12:54.103
You can't just run and hide
when something gets uncomfortable.

12:54.137 --> 12:55.454
You have to...

12:55.456 --> 12:57.389
stay and work through it.

12:58.425 --> 12:59.458
He won't be pregnant for ever.

13:01.995 --> 13:04.280
You had me right up until the end there,

13:04.331 --> 13:07.199
but, you're right.

13:07.234 --> 13:09.151
I have to go find Danny and
hope that he forgives me.

13:09.202 --> 13:10.269
I've got to go talk to Zoey.

13:10.303 --> 13:12.104
Wait. Emma. Not it!

13:12.106 --> 13:13.105
Not it. Damn it!

13:15.175 --> 13:16.125
Danny?

13:16.176 --> 13:17.109
Danny, I'm here!

13:17.160 --> 13:18.110
Danny?

13:20.000 --> 13:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:27.988 --> 13:28.921
I'm too late.

13:35.200 --> 13:36.216
I guess it's true what they say

13:36.251 --> 13:38.035
about craving things when you're pregnant.

13:38.069 --> 13:39.069
Yeah.

13:39.104 --> 13:42.022
Who knew I was also craving
a date with a cute boy

13:42.024 --> 13:44.058
who apologized for being
an insensitive jerk?

13:44.092 --> 13:46.043
Thank you for letting us start over.

13:46.094 --> 13:47.911
I don't really deserve it.

13:47.946 --> 13:49.997
Well, if you knew how long it took me

13:50.031 --> 13:51.882
to zip up this dress,

13:51.933 --> 13:52.933
there was no way I was staying in.

13:54.035 --> 13:55.903
And I should probably be getting back.

13:55.937 --> 13:56.887
Okay.

13:58.857 --> 13:59.873
Oh, it's this way.

13:59.908 --> 14:01.709
No, it's this way.

14:01.711 --> 14:02.776
Are you sure?

14:04.746 --> 14:05.829
- Sorry I'm late!
- Oh!

14:05.864 --> 14:06.964
Muah!

14:06.998 --> 14:09.149
I got distracted by this
really good looking man on 72nd.

14:09.184 --> 14:11.118
We waved to each other
for about ten minutes

14:11.169 --> 14:13.020
before I realizes just looking

14:13.054 --> 14:14.138
at my own reflection in a window.

14:14.172 --> 14:15.989
Oh, my god.

14:18.094 --> 14:20.060
So, why am I here?

14:20.095 --> 14:21.929
We're gonna do it. Right now.

14:21.963 --> 14:23.063
Here?

14:23.098 --> 14:24.098
In front of Tucker?

14:24.100 --> 14:26.867
Yes. He's got the license.

14:26.901 --> 14:28.852
Oh. I didn't know you could get
a license to do that in the park.

14:28.887 --> 14:31.789
Oh, my... No!
Married, Brad!

14:31.823 --> 14:33.757
- We're getting married.
- Right.

14:33.808 --> 14:35.743
That's later, okay?

14:35.777 --> 14:36.910
All right. Hit it, Tucker.

14:38.213 --> 14:39.797
Hey, Danny. It's me again.

14:39.831 --> 14:41.148
If you could give me a call...

14:42.851 --> 14:44.168
Whoa.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.004
Danny?

14:48.139 --> 14:49.189
What are you doing?

14:49.224 --> 14:52.159
I'm just taking m'lady
for a little romantic ride.

14:52.210 --> 14:53.143
Get in.

14:54.195 --> 14:56.163
- This is so sweet, but...
- Please.

14:56.197 --> 14:57.965
I'm not horsin' around.

14:57.999 --> 15:00.017
Don't saddle me with excuses.

15:05.807 --> 15:07.808
You know what? I think I remember that tree.

15:07.842 --> 15:10.761
Yeah, yeah, we definitely passed that one.

15:10.812 --> 15:11.779
Or was it this one?

15:11.830 --> 15:13.831
Hey didn't *** these things?

15:16.201 --> 15:18.118
Oh, my god, I'm having a baby!

15:18.120 --> 15:19.770
Yeah, I think we've established that.

15:19.804 --> 15:20.771
No, now!

15:20.822 --> 15:22.172
I'm having a baby right now!

15:22.207 --> 15:24.041
N... n... now?
Are you sure?

15:24.092 --> 15:25.726
Okay, well, okay, don't
panic. No need to panic.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.727
I'm not panicking!

15:26.761 --> 15:28.078
Well, I am! Help!

15:28.129 --> 15:29.947
Help us!

15:29.981 --> 15:31.064
Pregnant lady lost in a park!

15:31.066 --> 15:32.032
Help!

15:38.039 --> 15:39.923
So, there's something I need to say,

15:39.974 --> 15:41.975
and I don't want you to interrupt
me until I'm done saying it.

15:42.026 --> 15:43.794
Riley...

15:43.828 --> 15:44.878
I'm sorry that I've been acting so weird.

15:44.880 --> 15:45.846
I wasn't done.

15:46.931 --> 15:48.198
- Riley...
- I lied.

15:48.249 --> 15:50.801
I li and I've been lying.

15:50.852 --> 15:53.203
The whole last month has been a lie.

15:53.238 --> 15:56.757
The fainting, the pretending
not to remember the proposal...

15:56.808 --> 15:59.193
What? It's not because I don't love you.

15:59.195 --> 16:00.160
It was all just...

16:00.211 --> 16:01.979
it was too much.

16:02.013 --> 16:03.680
I'm so happy that we're a couple now.

16:03.715 --> 16:05.115
I'm so happy, but...

16:05.150 --> 16:06.967
I'm not ready to be married.

16:07.018 --> 16:08.018
Okay.

16:08.052 --> 16:09.119
Not where I th this was going.

16:09.154 --> 16:10.904
At least not right now.

16:10.955 --> 16:12.089
Some...
someday maybe.

16:12.123 --> 16:13.807
- But I just...
- It doesn't matter.

16:14.993 --> 16:16.910
Now it's my turn.

16:16.912 --> 16:17.895
Oh, my god.

16:19.998 --> 16:21.782
Riley, I've been in love with you

16:21.833 --> 16:22.883
for as long as I can remember.

16:22.885 --> 16:24.852
Someone help us we're having a baby!

16:24.903 --> 16:25.869
Oh, thank god.

16:27.222 --> 16:28.722
- Ben?
- Danny?

16:28.773 --> 16:30.707
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

16:30.742 --> 16:32.125
Panicking! My date's having a baby!

16:32.127 --> 16:33.727
Oh... oh, hi!

16:33.761 --> 16:35.028
You must be Zoey!

16:36.080 --> 16:37.998
Okay. You know, we can talk later.

16:38.032 --> 16:40.017
Danny, help her up.
Riley, call 9-1-1. Come on.

16:40.068 --> 16:41.735
Yeah..

16:41.737 --> 16:43.904
Don't worry, it's okay. We'll
get you out of here in no time.

16:43.938 --> 16:45.973
Oh, wow, you're heavy.

16:45.975 --> 16:47.074
Never mind. All good. Shutting up.

16:47.076 --> 16:49.042
Let's move, We're having a baby!

16:49.093 --> 16:50.844
Yah!

16:50.895 --> 16:51.862
Ah! Danny!

16:51.896 --> 16:52.946
Oh, my...

16:52.948 --> 16:53.914
Riley!

16:53.965 --> 16:56.817
So by the power vested in me,

16:56.868 --> 16:58.802
- I pronounce you...
- Help!

16:58.837 --> 16:59.853
Son of a...

17:00.905 --> 17:03.790
Is anybody... We
need some help!

17:03.842 --> 17:04.775
Mom?

17:04.809 --> 17:06.059
What are you doing here?

17:06.109 --> 17:07.711
Trying to get married.

17:07.744 --> 17:08.762
What are you doing here?

17:08.796 --> 17:10.146
Well, Ben's in the back
of a runaway carriage

17:10.198 --> 17:12.115
trying to deliver a baby
and Riley's at the reins.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.133
Well, there's that.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.037
I hate all of you.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.973
Okay, okay, let's breathe.

17:19.974 --> 17:21.074
All big deep breaths.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.709
Yeah, big deep breaths.

17:22.743 --> 17:24.044
- Are we breathing?
- Who can breath at a time like this

17:24.095 --> 17:25.811
I was talking to Zoey!

17:25.847 --> 17:26.797
It's coming!

17:26.830 --> 17:27.915
What? Now?

17:27.949 --> 17:28.999
No, no, no! That's not a good idea.

17:29.033 --> 17:30.884
Just... just suck
it back in there.

17:30.935 --> 17:31.935
It doesn't work like that!

17:33.738 --> 17:34.821
Hold on. Maybe I should take this.

17:34.823 --> 17:36.173
Oh, thank god! It's my mom.

17:36.224 --> 17:38.725
Hey! Mom. Hi!

17:38.727 --> 17:40.160
Zoey's having her baby! What do I do?

17:40.162 --> 17:42.145
Find a new mom because after this,

17:42.180 --> 17:43.180
I am done with you!

17:44.832 --> 17:46.049
Don't bite, Bon-Bon.

17:46.084 --> 17:48.018
The miracle of life is happening.

17:48.069 --> 17:49.102
God, I feel so insignificant.

17:50.188 --> 17:51.171
Okay, fine.

17:51.205 --> 17:53.056
All right, how close is she?

17:53.091 --> 17:54.107
She's right next to me.

17:54.142 --> 17:55.976
<i>To giving birth!</i>

17:56.010 --> 17:57.995
Oh. You look.

17:58.046 --> 18:00.080
Oh, my... -Oh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:00.114 --> 18:02.849
All right, back that up a few feet.

18:02.884 --> 18:04.001
Okay!

18:04.035 --> 18:06.053
9-1-1 says she
needs to breath!

18:06.087 --> 18:07.854
Way past that!

18:07.889 --> 18:09.957
Focus on that baby.

18:09.959 --> 18:12.759
It is about to be born
whether you like it or not,

18:12.794 --> 18:14.912
<i>so just use everything that your
father taught you in little league</i>

18:14.946 --> 18:16.897
and catch it like a fly ball!

18:16.931 --> 18:18.832
Mom, Ben got kicked out of little league.

18:18.866 --> 18:20.250
No, I didn't.

18:20.301 --> 18:20.798
Yeah, you did!

18:20.824 --> 18:22.786
This seems like something
we can talk about later!

18:22.820 --> 18:24.771
Uh-oh. Is that a head?

18:24.773 --> 18:26.123
Ah. Yeah, I think that's a head.

18:26.157 --> 18:27.708
I think I'm gonna pass out.

18:27.710 --> 18:28.709
Riley, hold the phone please.

18:28.743 --> 18:30.060
Okay. All right. Okay.

18:30.094 --> 18:32.696
I told you, I don't
know our exact...

18:32.747 --> 18:34.081
Oh! Oh, Tavern on the Green!

18:34.115 --> 18:35.165
I always wanted to eat there.

18:35.216 --> 18:38.018
I hear their salad is to die.

18:38.069 --> 18:39.953
The baby!

18:39.988 --> 18:42.022
What's going on with the baby?

18:42.056 --> 18:43.907
I got its shoulders!

18:43.942 --> 18:46.827
Oh, man, it's gotta hurt!

18:46.861 --> 18:48.946
Riley, Riley, to stop it,
you gotta grease the rails

18:48.997 --> 18:51.715
on an uphill slop and
then hit the fuel cut off.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.835
Oh, wait. No, that's how
to stop a runaway train.

18:54.869 --> 18:55.852
You know what? Never mind.

18:55.887 --> 18:56.887
Shut up, shut up.

18:56.921 --> 18:58.739
All right. Riley, talk to me!

18:58.773 --> 18:59.823
Whoa!

18:59.857 --> 19:01.091
Whoa...

19:02.844 --> 19:03.794
Yes!

19:03.845 --> 19:05.679
I did it! I am amazing!

19:07.115 --> 19:09.032
Oh! Zoey, are you okay?

19:09.067 --> 19:11.018
I'm perfect.

19:11.069 --> 19:12.669
We're all

19:12.704 --> 19:14.921
Hey, little guy. You want to meet your mom?

19:19.927 --> 19:20.927
So, on a scale of one to ten,

19:20.929 --> 19:22.846
how do you think this date's going so far?

19:29.871 --> 19:30.904
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:30.955 --> 19:32.005
So...

19:32.007 --> 19:33.890
I guess we still need to talk.

19:33.941 --> 19:35.042
No.

19:35.076 --> 19:37.711
I need to talk and you need
to be quiet for a change.

19:37.713 --> 19:39.179
Ght. But listen, Danny, I just...

19:40.181 --> 19:41.732
Sorry.

19:41.783 --> 19:43.700
Like I said,

19:43.735 --> 19:45.736
I've been in love with you my whole life

19:45.787 --> 19:47.788
and I'm gonna be in love
with you for the rest of it.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.790
We might not always be on the same page

19:49.792 --> 19:51.758
at the same time,

19:51.793 --> 19:52.876
but this time, I think we are.

19:54.762 --> 19:57.764
Riley, will you marry me...

19:59.217 --> 20:00.767
someday?

20:05.223 --> 20:06.807
Is that finally a yes?

20:06.809 --> 20:08.809
Yes. Yes!

20:14.958 --> 20:18.561
By the power vested
in me, I now pronounce you...

20:18.586 --> 20:23.872
Husband and wife, you may
swallow each other's faces.

20:23.897 --> 20:25.897
