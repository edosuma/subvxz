00:00.031 --> 00:01.660
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>
<i>Here are a few things that</i>

00:01.685 --> 00:02.569
<i>you might need to know.</i>

00:02.570 --> 00:04.712
I'll be locked in solitary
the rest of my life,

00:05.080 --> 00:07.515
but one thing's going to
keep me warm at night.

00:07.550 --> 00:09.083
Do you remember Hungary?

00:09.118 --> 00:12.687
Does Chuck know
about the baby?

00:16.292 --> 00:18.243
Hey, honey,

00:18.294 --> 00:20.278
I haven't heard
from you for a while.

00:20.312 --> 00:21.546
I miss you.

00:21.580 --> 00:25.866
Wherever you are,
I hope you're okay, safe.

00:25.884 --> 00:27.168
I want you to know,

00:27.202 --> 00:31.606
if you ever feel like you need
a place to come home to,

00:31.640 --> 00:35.109
well, you have one.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.047
Who was that?

00:40.065 --> 00:41.349
Nobody.

00:41.383 --> 00:42.984
Are we a go?

00:43.018 --> 00:45.687
Affirmative.

01:17.920 --> 01:19.921
Ryker, I'm in.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.255
How many?

01:21.290 --> 01:22.457
I count 11.

01:22.491 --> 01:23.924
Copy that.

01:23.942 --> 01:26.761
On my word, take them out,

01:26.795 --> 01:27.962
all of them.

01:31.867 --> 01:34.002
The men in that room
just slaughtered

01:34.036 --> 01:35.570
the couple that lived
in this house.

01:35.604 --> 01:37.655
Give them the opportunity,
they'll kill you, too.

01:40.175 --> 01:41.509
Now move.

02:11.323 --> 02:14.308
♪

02:14.326 --> 02:15.476
Next?

02:15.511 --> 02:17.478
Double doors, three o'clock.

02:17.513 --> 02:18.813
The package is inside.

02:31.093 --> 02:33.561
Ryker, th-the package...

02:33.595 --> 02:35.129
The baby is the package.

02:35.164 --> 02:37.031
Grab it and get out of there.

02:37.066 --> 02:39.133
But what am,
what am I supposed...?

02:39.168 --> 02:40.301
Move, Walker.

02:40.335 --> 02:41.969
I'm your handler
and that's an order.

02:58.036 --> 02:59.754
Oh, my God, he knows.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.660
Hey, honey.

03:05.694 --> 03:07.545
You ready for
my big surprise?

03:07.579 --> 03:09.247
Absolutely.

03:09.298 --> 03:11.866
You know how much
I love surprises.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.468
Chuck, where are we?

03:13.502 --> 03:14.702
Okay, here we
go, up farther.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.704
Straight, straight,
straight, straight,

03:16.722 --> 03:18.406
and ta-dah!

03:20.976 --> 03:23.077
Oh, my God,
this is the house.

03:23.112 --> 03:24.846
It's our house.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.047
How, how did
you do th...?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.248
The real estate
agent gave me

03:27.282 --> 03:30.184
the keys so we could try
it out for the weekend.

03:30.219 --> 03:31.419
Um, full disclosure--

03:31.453 --> 03:33.955
I think she might have a
little crush on me, so...

03:33.989 --> 03:35.757
Chuck, this is,
this is beautiful,

03:35.791 --> 03:37.525
but we still
can't afford it.

03:37.559 --> 03:38.793
Actually, we can.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.294
I was talking
to Beckman, and

03:40.329 --> 03:42.396
apparently her offer
to rejoin the CIA

03:42.431 --> 03:43.798
comes with a
signing bonus,

03:43.832 --> 03:45.767
which is enough for a
down payment on the house

03:45.801 --> 03:48.369
and that dresser I've been
eyeing at Anthropologie.

03:48.403 --> 03:51.806
Uh, I don't know
what to say.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.207
Don't say anything.

03:53.242 --> 03:54.375
Just visualize.

03:54.409 --> 03:55.810
Think to yourself,

03:55.844 --> 03:58.079
"What would my life be like
in such an amazing home

03:58.113 --> 04:00.882
with the most dashing
man I've ever met?"

04:00.916 --> 04:02.049
Okay.

04:02.084 --> 04:03.217
All right,
all right, so

04:03.252 --> 04:05.419
after a hard day's
work, we come home

04:05.437 --> 04:07.455
to the sweet, sweet
sounds of Nina Simone

04:07.489 --> 04:09.857
emanating
from our record player,

04:09.892 --> 04:11.292
which would fit perfectly--
I don't know--

04:11.326 --> 04:12.827
say, in this corner
right behind me.

04:12.861 --> 04:13.895
Huh?

04:13.929 --> 04:15.296
Open floor plan--
great for relaxing

04:15.330 --> 04:17.298
and watching your
husband cook.

04:17.332 --> 04:19.065
Cooking and talking,
talking and cooking.

04:19.101 --> 04:22.637
This area right here--
perfect for my game chairs.

04:22.671 --> 04:24.472
Or not.

04:24.506 --> 04:26.774
Maybe we'll talk
about that, but this,

04:26.809 --> 04:28.843
this is perfect.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.945
The door frame?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.315
When Ellie and I
were kids,

04:34.349 --> 04:36.284
our dad would measure us
every year

04:36.318 --> 04:37.351
to see how tall
we were getting.

04:37.386 --> 04:39.020
I remember being
so excited

04:39.054 --> 04:40.822
when I was finally
taller than Ellie.

04:40.856 --> 04:42.456
It took a while, but

04:42.491 --> 04:44.492
tenth grade was
a good year for me.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.463
What's the matter, what's
the matter, what have I done?

04:49.481 --> 04:51.132
Something-Something's missing,
something's wrong?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.767
Is it the game chairs?
'Cause those are negotiable.

04:52.801 --> 04:54.001
No, Chuck,
it's not that.

04:54.036 --> 04:56.804
Um, look, I
want this house

04:56.839 --> 04:58.940
and I want the life that
you have envisioned for us.

04:58.974 --> 05:01.976
I want every
single part of it.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.679
It's just that something urgent
has come up.

05:04.713 --> 05:05.680
What is it?

05:05.714 --> 05:07.148
You know you can tell me
anything.

05:09.051 --> 05:11.052
Well, that's just it.

05:12.287 --> 05:14.222
This time, Chuck,
I can't tell you.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.332
There are more men coming.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.566
Get the package
and get out of there.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.223
It's going to be okay.

just, just tell me
where you're going,

06:24.146 --> 06:25.413
tell me what happened.

06:25.447 --> 06:26.831
I thought we decided
no more secrets,

06:26.882 --> 06:28.282
no more doing things
on our own.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.284
Your words,
not mine.

06:29.318 --> 06:30.501
Look, I know,
I know that.

06:30.552 --> 06:32.670
It's just, I need you
to trust me on this.

06:32.721 --> 06:34.455
It's not that I don't trust you,
this is not about trust.

06:34.490 --> 06:35.456
What's so urgent, Bartowski?

06:35.474 --> 06:36.924
Yeah, why'd you make Casey

06:36.958 --> 06:38.142
come all the way
down here?

06:38.177 --> 06:39.761
You know I'm gonna follow him
everywhere he goes,

06:39.795 --> 06:41.095
and I was doing something
really important.

06:43.799 --> 06:44.766
Where you
going, Walker?

06:44.800 --> 06:45.984
It's nothing; I'll be back soon.

06:46.018 --> 06:47.769
J-Just wait,
just wait one second.

06:47.803 --> 06:49.771
Hear me out.

06:49.805 --> 06:52.073
Yes, I love you, so, of course,

06:52.107 --> 06:54.175
I'm going to want to
know what's going on,

06:54.209 --> 06:56.277
why this mission needs
to be so secretive,

06:56.312 --> 06:59.314
why you need so many guns,

06:59.348 --> 07:00.782
but I'm willing
to put all that aside.

07:00.816 --> 07:01.866
Really?

07:01.917 --> 07:03.217
Really?
Really?

07:04.553 --> 07:05.503
Sure,

07:05.537 --> 07:06.788
husbands ask
a lot of questions.

07:06.822 --> 07:08.022
You know who doesn't?

07:08.057 --> 07:09.323
Carmichael Industries,

07:09.341 --> 07:11.392
and as CEO of
Carmichael Industries,

07:11.427 --> 07:13.695
I would like to offer you
our services--

07:13.729 --> 07:14.996
pro bono, of course.

07:15.030 --> 07:17.515
Well, it wouldn't
change anything.

07:17.549 --> 07:19.166
There are still things
I can't tell you.

07:19.184 --> 07:21.135
You're the client,
you're the boss.

07:21.169 --> 07:22.236
Whatever this is, Walker,

07:22.271 --> 07:23.638
backup couldn't hurt.

07:31.013 --> 07:32.480
Okay, here's what
I can tell you.

07:32.514 --> 07:34.916
The man that we're going after--
his name is Kieran Ryker--

07:34.950 --> 07:36.918
ex-CIA, very dangerous.

07:36.952 --> 07:39.487
Before we took down Shaw, he
sent a communiqué to Ryker,

07:39.521 --> 07:40.955
and I'm gonna send one back
posing as Shaw

07:40.989 --> 07:42.323
so that I can set up a meet.

07:42.357 --> 07:43.324
Morgan, you're gonna
stay in Castle

07:43.359 --> 07:44.692
in case anything
goes wrong.

07:44.727 --> 07:46.728
Chuck and Casey, pack your bags.

07:46.762 --> 07:48.196
We're going to Budapest tonight.

07:48.230 --> 07:50.498
All right, great,
I'll bring a sweater.

07:50.532 --> 07:52.199
Good.

07:54.236 --> 07:56.721
You sure you can keep
your mouth shut this time?

07:56.755 --> 07:58.005
Of course.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.475
Geez, Casey, you act like
I haven't learned anything

08:00.509 --> 08:01.809
in the last four years.

08:03.145 --> 08:04.262
Morgan, I need to know

08:04.313 --> 08:05.513
what's going on with
Sarah, so I've done

08:05.547 --> 08:07.482
some research-- research
on Hungarian culture

08:07.516 --> 08:10.217
cross-referenced with
general horrible things

08:10.235 --> 08:11.719
that Sarah might want
to keep a secret.

08:11.737 --> 08:13.654
But didn't you tell Sarah
that you wouldn't...?

08:13.689 --> 08:15.990
Wikipedia-ing facts about
Hungary is harmless.

08:16.024 --> 08:17.058
I, for one, had no idea

08:17.092 --> 08:18.793
the Rubik's Cube
was invented there.

08:18.827 --> 08:20.528
Sure, I just think maybe
you should give Sarah

08:20.562 --> 08:21.829
the benefit of the doubt.
I mean,

08:21.864 --> 08:23.931
any time the two of you have
ever disagreed about anything,

08:23.966 --> 08:25.500
she's been right. I can name
four or five different times...

08:25.534 --> 08:28.202
No, no, no, I-I know,
I know, it's just,

08:28.237 --> 08:29.504
I'm worried that we
won't be prepared

08:29.538 --> 08:31.973
if something goes wrong,
but if you're here

08:32.006 --> 08:33.908
in Castle, I guess
we'll be okay.

08:33.942 --> 08:36.376
Yeah.

08:36.410 --> 08:37.979
Kind of a bummer
about the timing, though.

08:38.013 --> 08:39.046
I was supposed
to have game night

08:39.081 --> 08:40.148
with Ellie
and Awesome.

08:40.182 --> 08:42.250
Alex said she was gonna
come by, too, and...

08:42.284 --> 08:43.732
I still don't know
where her and I stand.

08:43.756 --> 08:44.485
Wait, wait,

08:44.486 --> 08:46.270
why do you have to cancel? You
don't have to cancel game night.

08:46.305 --> 08:47.271
Have game night
in Castle.

08:47.306 --> 08:48.322
Ellie and Awesome
have wanted

08:48.357 --> 08:49.991
to check it out
more anyway.

08:50.025 --> 08:51.092
Ever since that
last mission,

08:51.126 --> 08:52.226
they keep asking me
tactical questions

08:52.261 --> 08:54.495
and using the
term "ghost op"

08:54.530 --> 08:55.930
as if they know
what it means.

08:55.964 --> 08:57.899
Plus, this way,

08:57.933 --> 09:00.067
if anything does go
wrong, we'll be ready.

09:00.101 --> 09:01.235
I'm on it.
Thank you.

09:07.342 --> 09:10.678
Hey, listen, I know you
can't talk to Bartowski

09:10.712 --> 09:12.380
about what's
really going on.

09:12.414 --> 09:14.449
That blabbermouth can't keep
a secret to save his life.

09:14.483 --> 09:16.417
But you can tell me, hmm?

09:16.452 --> 09:20.254
I appreciate that, John, but
the less you know the better.

09:23.125 --> 09:25.126
Really.

09:26.862 --> 09:29.297
Sure, no problem.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.864
Walker.

09:50.485 --> 09:51.452
Uh...

09:51.487 --> 09:54.689
look, before I hand over...
the package,

09:54.723 --> 09:56.841
I need to know what's going
to happen to her.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.212
I'm afraid that's
above your pay grade.

10:03.331 --> 10:06.968
This mission wasn't sanctioned
by the CIA, was it?

10:12.274 --> 10:14.242
Look, we did a good thing.

10:14.276 --> 10:16.811
The men you took out killed
that girl's entire family.

10:18.547 --> 10:20.481
She's the only heir
to a massive fortune,

10:20.516 --> 10:22.016
so whoever has her

10:22.050 --> 10:24.368
has access to it.

10:24.403 --> 10:25.753
She's the key.

10:25.787 --> 10:27.588
And you want the money.

10:29.291 --> 10:32.727
Listen, I know this job is
the only thing in your life,

10:32.761 --> 10:35.863
but someday you're gonna
realize it's not enough,

10:35.881 --> 10:37.415
that keeping
your whole life

10:37.466 --> 10:39.700
a secret from everyone
who loves you

10:39.718 --> 10:41.702
is too much.

10:41.737 --> 10:43.370
But you don't have a family.

10:45.641 --> 10:46.941
That money's just for you.

10:46.975 --> 10:49.043
And what's going to happen
to her when you take it?

10:53.599 --> 10:55.683
She has a legitimate claim
to that fortune,

10:55.717 --> 10:56.918
then she can come back

10:56.952 --> 10:58.269
at any time
and take it from you.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.789
And you expect me to believe
that you're gonna let her live?

11:04.927 --> 11:06.444
You're a rotten handler, Ryker.

11:49.271 --> 11:50.404
Okay.

11:52.574 --> 11:54.325
It's okay.
It's okay. Shh.

11:54.376 --> 11:56.010
Stay. Stay.

12:05.954 --> 12:07.421
So,

12:07.456 --> 12:09.790
uh, honey, this
Ryker fellow--

12:09.825 --> 12:12.176
is there anything about him
you'd care to elaborate on?

12:12.227 --> 12:13.928
Any personal details
we should know about?

12:13.962 --> 12:15.680
How he takes his
coffee, for example?

12:15.731 --> 12:17.131
No. You know everything
that you need to know.

12:19.484 --> 12:22.770
Okay, I'm gonna be at that cafe
waiting for him to arrive.

12:22.804 --> 12:24.772
I need the two of you to
stay up here away from Ryker,

12:24.806 --> 12:26.874
surveilling the street to see
if anybody else is watching me.

12:26.908 --> 12:27.858
Okay?

12:27.909 --> 12:29.276
O-kay.

12:30.479 --> 12:31.646
No. Wait.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.948
No. You know what, Sarah?
Sarah, no, not okay.

12:33.982 --> 12:35.366
Can't we just set
aside the whole

12:35.417 --> 12:37.818
CEO of Carmichael Industries
thing just for a second?

12:37.836 --> 12:39.153
No, Chuck, that wasn't part
of the deal.

12:39.187 --> 12:40.287
Yeah, except
that I'm your husband

12:40.321 --> 12:41.522
who would do anything
in the world for you,

12:41.556 --> 12:43.057
and I'm worried.
Okay, look,

12:43.091 --> 12:44.208
this isn't about me.

12:44.259 --> 12:45.526
There are lives in danger

12:45.560 --> 12:47.294
because of something that...

12:47.328 --> 12:49.630
Look, if I tell you, I'm not
only compromising their safety,

12:49.665 --> 12:50.798
but your safety, as well.

12:50.832 --> 12:52.499
Okay, so, when you
see Ryker, what then?

12:52.517 --> 12:54.501
What are you gonna do?

12:54.519 --> 12:57.221
I'm gonna kill him, Chuck.

13:12.629 --> 13:14.070
Still nothing.

13:15.021 --> 13:17.256
Look, I know I typically
overreact to stuff like this,

13:17.290 --> 13:19.174
but there's something
about this entire situation

13:19.226 --> 13:20.359
that I do not like.

13:20.393 --> 13:21.810
This time, you might be right,
Bartowski.

13:21.845 --> 13:23.529
Did some digging.

13:23.563 --> 13:25.964
Turns out, Ryker's whole file
has been redacted.

13:25.982 --> 13:28.100
Which means whatever happened
between him and Sarah ended

13:28.134 --> 13:29.801
pretty damn badly.

13:47.387 --> 13:48.654
Sarah, what's going on?

13:48.688 --> 13:49.822
Um, it's nothing.

13:49.856 --> 13:51.340
I need you two
to follow the waiter.

13:51.374 --> 13:52.825
I think he might be working
with Ryker.

13:54.427 --> 13:56.295
Don't move.

13:56.329 --> 13:57.463
We'll be right down.

14:04.271 --> 14:05.688
Where... Where is Sarah?

14:08.024 --> 14:10.059
Got him.

14:11.895 --> 14:14.730
Sarah, wait, wait!
Wait. Where are you going?!

14:14.781 --> 14:16.749
Ryker figured out it was me.
I'm sorry.

14:16.783 --> 14:18.850
I've got to go
do this alone.

14:20.403 --> 14:22.404
The waiter!
Come on, come on!

14:26.126 --> 14:28.994
Still no word from Chuck.

14:29.028 --> 14:30.913
Everything must be going well
on the mish.

14:30.964 --> 14:31.914
Your turn, bro.

14:31.965 --> 14:33.582
Oh, right.

14:34.868 --> 14:36.835
Okay.

14:36.870 --> 14:40.439
You know what? I feel so lucky
to have a lady to share my

14:40.473 --> 14:42.591
little plastic car with,
and, uh,

14:42.642 --> 14:45.511
not afraid to put a couple
of kids in the backseat.

14:45.545 --> 14:47.012
Not now, obviously.
That'd be crazy.

14:47.047 --> 14:48.847
But you know,
someday. You know,

14:48.882 --> 14:50.916
commitment is not something
that I fear.

14:50.950 --> 14:52.685
Well, I'm keeping
my options open.

14:52.719 --> 14:54.253
Yeah, I noticed.
There you are

14:54.287 --> 14:56.689
in your little pink car
by yourself. Must be so lonely.

14:58.892 --> 15:00.340
What is going on
with these two?

15:00.360 --> 15:01.140
I thought they worked
everything out.

15:01.165 --> 15:01.994
Me, too.

15:01.995 --> 15:03.679
Maybe they need
some alone time.

15:03.704 --> 15:04.563
Great.

15:04.564 --> 15:05.764
Because if I have to spin

15:05.799 --> 15:07.766
for a new mortgage rate again,
I'm going to die.

15:07.801 --> 15:09.752
It's like we're actively
wasting our baby-sitter.

15:09.786 --> 15:11.954
Okay, let's, uh...
let's speed things along here.

15:12.005 --> 15:13.605
Then you and I can have

15:13.640 --> 15:15.874
- a little look-see in Castle.
- Ellie?

15:15.909 --> 15:16.458
Hmm?

15:16.509 --> 15:17.242
Uh, your turn.

15:17.277 --> 15:18.577
Yeah, my turn.

15:18.595 --> 15:20.129
Hey, spin a ten,
game is over.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.413
All right. Spin...

15:21.448 --> 15:23.248
...a ten.
Okay.

15:31.925 --> 15:32.424
Oh!

15:33.360 --> 15:35.761
Millionaire Estates!

15:35.779 --> 15:36.628
Yay!

15:36.663 --> 15:37.629
Yeah, baby!

15:37.664 --> 15:39.331
We won in Life.
We did.

15:40.667 --> 15:41.900
Yeah.
Okay.

15:41.935 --> 15:43.469
We'll take a little
breather before

15:43.503 --> 15:45.103
the next game, guys.
Bye. Yeah, good, good.

15:45.121 --> 15:47.272
Good kids.

15:51.378 --> 15:54.413
Oh! Our hands touched for a
second, and I kind of got, like,

15:54.447 --> 15:56.148
a chill on my back.

15:56.182 --> 15:58.167
It's kind of
funny, 'cause...

15:58.218 --> 15:59.785
Morgan?
Mm?

15:59.819 --> 16:01.587
What am I really doing here?

16:01.621 --> 16:03.155
I'm-I'm not here
to try anything,

16:03.189 --> 16:04.490
if that's what
you're asking.

16:04.524 --> 16:05.824
Unless what you're asking is

16:05.859 --> 16:08.425
that you want me to...
- No.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.462
That's what I'm
saying-- no, of course. Uh...

16:10.530 --> 16:13.699
There's no quick fix for us.

16:13.733 --> 16:16.635
It's just going
to take some time.

16:16.653 --> 16:17.803
I know that.

16:17.837 --> 16:19.171
Hey, I totally get it.

16:21.207 --> 16:22.641
How about a game of Sorry?

16:24.444 --> 16:28.414
Sorry! Sorry!
Sorry!

16:28.448 --> 16:31.149
Come back.
Sorry. Sorry.

16:32.502 --> 16:33.819
Ahh!

16:33.837 --> 16:35.187
Whoa! Yeah!

16:35.221 --> 16:36.522
Once again, look who doesn't
need the Intersect.

16:36.556 --> 16:37.990
Where's Ryker?

16:38.024 --> 16:40.559
Where the hell is he?

16:44.464 --> 16:46.432
Do you speak Hungarian?

16:46.466 --> 16:48.166
No.

16:48.184 --> 16:50.502
Do you, Mr. "I don't need
the Intersect?"

16:50.537 --> 16:53.722
I think I got a phrase
book on me somewhere.

16:59.446 --> 17:00.779
Uh...

17:08.371 --> 17:10.571
What are you doing?

17:10.623 --> 17:12.741
I got her in the deli.

17:13.960 --> 17:15.661
What? She wasn't
busy. It's Europe.

17:15.694 --> 17:18.029
Would you mind
asking this gentleman

17:18.047 --> 17:19.832
what his business is
with Ryker?

17:36.282 --> 17:39.418
He said this man you are asking
about gave me 20,000

17:39.452 --> 17:40.853
forint to put a note

17:40.887 --> 17:42.287
under a coffee cup.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.856
He doesn't know anything else.

17:43.890 --> 17:45.958
He's lying.

17:45.992 --> 17:49.561
I think you understand
every word I'm saying.

17:49.579 --> 17:51.797
You're gonna tell me
where Ryker is,

17:51.831 --> 17:53.465
or you're gonna lose a lung.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.701
Where the hell is Ryker?!

17:58.271 --> 18:00.239
Any sign of her?

18:00.273 --> 18:02.274
Nothing yet, sir.

18:04.477 --> 18:05.611
You didn't think

18:05.645 --> 18:07.880
I was just gonna use
the front door, did you?

18:07.914 --> 18:09.648
I knew you wouldn't use
the front door.

18:09.682 --> 18:13.084
You tell me everything
Sean told you right now.

18:16.322 --> 18:18.223
What is that?

18:22.295 --> 18:24.613
Oh, God, I don't know
what you want. What do you want?

18:24.647 --> 18:26.148
What do you need?

18:27.450 --> 18:28.617
Oh, my God.

18:28.651 --> 18:31.954
Okay. Okay.

18:33.506 --> 18:34.489
Um...

18:37.660 --> 18:40.445
Hello?

18:40.480 --> 18:42.280
Uh, hi, Mom. It's me.

18:42.298 --> 18:45.133
Honey? Are you okay?

18:45.168 --> 18:46.718
Where are you?

18:46.753 --> 18:48.620
I'm just... I'm uh... I'm
in a bit of a situation here.

18:48.638 --> 18:50.088
Are you hurt?

18:50.123 --> 18:51.690
Uh, no, no, no, no,
it's nothing like that.

18:51.724 --> 18:53.191
I was on a mission, and, um...

18:53.226 --> 18:55.394
Well, I'm looking after a baby,
and she won't stop crying,

18:55.428 --> 18:57.029
and I'm not really sure
what to do.

18:57.063 --> 18:58.296
Can you please help me?

18:58.314 --> 18:59.798
Okay. Uh, yeah.

18:59.832 --> 19:01.633
Um, is she wet?

19:01.668 --> 19:05.103
Uh, no. No, it's not that, and
I... and I fed her an hour ago.

19:05.137 --> 19:07.005
Did you try rocking her?

19:07.040 --> 19:08.106
What? No.

19:08.140 --> 19:09.207
Okay, honey, I want you

19:09.242 --> 19:10.842
to bring her close to you.

19:10.877 --> 19:12.143
She needs to feel safe.

19:12.161 --> 19:13.862
She needs to feel your warmth.

19:15.164 --> 19:16.481
Okay.

19:16.499 --> 19:18.183
Okay, she's close. Now what?

19:18.217 --> 19:21.203
Okay, now just-just rock her.

19:21.254 --> 19:23.622
Slowly back and forth and...

19:25.258 --> 19:27.626
Mom, this is not working.
I'm not good at this.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.044
What am I supposed to do?

19:29.095 --> 19:30.712
Don't freak out, honey.
It's okay.

19:30.763 --> 19:32.464
It's okay. Just, um...

19:32.498 --> 19:34.666
Just try singing to her.

19:36.135 --> 19:38.887
Um... what am I supposed
to sing?

19:38.938 --> 19:41.173
Do you remember the lullaby

19:41.207 --> 19:43.508
I used to sing to you
when you were little?

19:43.543 --> 19:47.245
Yeah. Uh, I-I think so.

19:48.848 --> 19:51.984
♪ Slumber, my darling

19:52.018 --> 19:56.405
♪ Your mother is near

19:56.456 --> 20:03.428
♪ Guarding your dreams
from all terror and fear ♪

20:03.463 --> 20:10.602
♪ Sunlight has past
and the twilight has gone ♪

20:10.637 --> 20:16.008
♪ Slumber, my darling

20:16.042 --> 20:20.178
♪ And the night's coming on.

20:23.449 --> 20:25.417
Did it work?

20:25.451 --> 20:28.353
Yeah.

20:28.387 --> 20:30.689
Yeah, it worked, Mom.

20:30.723 --> 20:33.425
Thank you.

20:54.981 --> 20:56.882
Tie her up.

21:05.106 --> 21:08.008
I have to give you credit
on that fake communiqué.

21:08.042 --> 21:10.477
Unfortunately for
you, I already knew

21:10.511 --> 21:12.646
that Shaw was
back in prison.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.365
So tell me,

21:15.400 --> 21:17.017
did you just come all this way

21:17.051 --> 21:19.686
to have a cup of coffee
with your old handler?

21:20.789 --> 21:22.756
You're asking
the wrong question.

21:24.759 --> 21:26.927
Just get to the point, Ryker.

21:26.961 --> 21:30.998
The point is that it's
not about money anymore.

21:31.032 --> 21:32.733
You know why

21:32.767 --> 21:34.701
I requested to be your handler?

21:34.736 --> 21:37.704
Why I brought you to
Budapest in the first place?

21:37.739 --> 21:40.474
Because your file
screamed loner.

21:40.508 --> 21:44.144
You had no family to speak
of, never trusted anyone.

21:44.179 --> 21:46.246
I knew
that you could keep a secret

21:46.281 --> 21:48.248
because you had no one to tell.

21:50.819 --> 21:53.020
And you still don't, do you?

21:54.388 --> 21:56.723
I bet no one even knows
that you're here.

21:56.758 --> 21:58.792
Do they?

21:58.827 --> 22:01.728
And that's why you're
gonna die today...

22:01.763 --> 22:04.231
unless you tell
me something.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.285
Where is she?

22:08.336 --> 22:10.921
Shaw told me
she's still alive.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.923
Where's the little girl?

22:14.976 --> 22:16.777
What?

22:16.811 --> 22:20.481
You don't know where she is,
and you're never gonna find out.

22:20.515 --> 22:23.433
That's why I came here.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.686
That's all I needed to know.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.255
Sir, there's a problem
in the foyer.

22:32.277 --> 22:33.644
I'm not done with you.

22:34.963 --> 22:37.030
Stay with her! You two,

22:37.065 --> 22:38.866
come with me.

22:40.368 --> 22:42.102
What the hell?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.871
They made me talk!

22:48.660 --> 22:50.544
What are you looking at?

22:50.578 --> 22:54.164
Sarah? Sarah,
baby, are you okay?

22:54.215 --> 22:56.350
Move. He was just
a distraction. Let's go.

23:02.340 --> 23:05.559
Tell me
where the nukes are, Doctor.

23:06.728 --> 23:09.429
Or should I call you...

23:09.463 --> 23:11.465
Damian?

23:12.817 --> 23:15.068
You may know my real name,

23:15.103 --> 23:19.473
but that doesn't mean that
I'll give you my intel, Cobress.

23:19.507 --> 23:22.409
Well, I have ways
of making you talk.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.215
Oh, okay. Ow! Ow! Ow!

23:28.249 --> 23:30.484
Okay, okay.
Is this... is this part of the bit, babe?

23:30.518 --> 23:31.702
No, I'm stuck.
It's my earring.

23:31.753 --> 23:32.819
I'm stuck... Ow.

23:32.837 --> 23:34.588
Okay, hold on,
hold on. All right.

23:34.622 --> 23:36.039
Oh! Ah!

23:36.090 --> 23:37.291
You all right?

23:37.325 --> 23:38.508
Yes.

23:38.543 --> 23:39.893
What was that accent?

23:39.928 --> 23:42.963
Oy. My British accent.

23:42.997 --> 23:44.798
- Really?
- Morgan, stop.

23:44.832 --> 23:46.967
I thought I could do this,
but I can't.

23:47.001 --> 23:48.835
If you don't...
if you don't want

23:48.853 --> 23:50.220
to play a game,
that's okay.

23:50.271 --> 23:52.272
You know what we could do?
We could watch a movie.

23:52.307 --> 23:53.573
We could watcha bunch of movies...

23:53.598 --> 23:55.153
You broke up with
with me in a text.

23:55.443 --> 23:57.311
I don't know how
to trust you again.

23:57.345 --> 23:59.980
I think I should
probably just go.

24:00.014 --> 24:01.448
Babe.
Babe.

24:01.482 --> 24:04.151
Maybe alone time
isn't what they needed.

24:04.185 --> 24:05.719
We have to do something.

24:05.753 --> 24:07.454
Yeah.

24:09.523 --> 24:10.991
Hey, there.
Hey. I'm actually

24:11.025 --> 24:12.459
heading home.
No, really. I'm...

24:12.493 --> 24:13.660
Alex, okay...
Devon, really, I...

24:13.695 --> 24:15.495
Listen, I think you're
making a mistake.

24:15.530 --> 24:16.713
Hey, you got a sec?

24:16.748 --> 24:18.999
What's that?

24:19.033 --> 24:20.434
What?
That...

24:20.468 --> 24:22.002
Oh. Uh, nothing. Just...

24:22.036 --> 24:25.839
Um, I actually wanted to
talk to you about Alex.

24:25.873 --> 24:28.208
I don't think you're
gonna understand

24:28.242 --> 24:29.276
what I'm going through here.

24:29.310 --> 24:32.512
I don't know
if you know this,

24:32.547 --> 24:34.681
but when Devon and I
first started dating,

24:34.716 --> 24:36.450
we took a break for a while.

24:36.484 --> 24:37.884
What happened?

24:37.919 --> 24:40.954
As you probably know,
I was an A & F model.

24:40.989 --> 24:43.824
I got to admit,
I let it go to my head.

24:43.858 --> 24:45.792
<i>He was a real ass.</i>

24:45.827 --> 24:47.260
For our first anniversary,

24:47.295 --> 24:50.263
he gave me a signed
photograph of himself.

24:50.298 --> 24:51.999
He was carrying a canoe

24:52.033 --> 24:54.301
in, in nothing but suit pants.

24:54.335 --> 24:55.736
And so I just,
I broke up with him.

24:55.770 --> 24:57.104
I had to win her back.

24:57.138 --> 24:59.172
You know, I couldn't
lose a woman like that.

24:59.207 --> 25:00.707
So I pulled out
all the stops.

25:00.742 --> 25:02.175
I made a Tracy
Chapman mix tape;

25:02.210 --> 25:04.444
I got front-row
tickets to Les Mis.

25:04.479 --> 25:05.929
I even baked those
little cupcakes,

25:05.963 --> 25:07.614
you know, the kind with
the peanut butter inside.

25:07.649 --> 25:08.782
Oh, yeah,
I like those.

25:08.816 --> 25:10.017
Yeah, so does she.

25:10.051 --> 25:11.852
Did it work?
Uh, no.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.186
So then what did you do?

25:13.221 --> 25:15.455
I mean, why did you
take him back?

25:15.490 --> 25:17.491
I don't think
he knows this,

25:17.525 --> 25:19.192
but I came home
from work one day,

25:19.227 --> 25:20.827
and he was sitting
on my doorstep

25:20.862 --> 25:22.462
with a bunch of calla lilies,

25:22.497 --> 25:24.831
and he must have
been there for hours,

25:24.866 --> 25:26.933
because he was
on the phone with his mom,

25:26.968 --> 25:29.036
and he was so sweet
with her.

25:29.070 --> 25:32.005
He really cared about
what she was saying.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.574
I just remembered that that was
the man I fell in love with.

25:34.609 --> 25:37.210
Calla lilies--
works every time.

25:39.614 --> 25:41.965
Devon, I really appreciate
this, but I've got to...

25:41.999 --> 25:43.417
No, Alex, come on.

25:43.451 --> 25:46.753
Yeah, we all make mistakes,
and Morgan made some big ones.

25:46.788 --> 25:48.789
Yeah.
Trust me,

25:48.823 --> 25:50.557
he loves you.

25:50.591 --> 25:53.126
<i>She's in pain, Morgan,</i>

25:53.161 --> 25:55.529
but if she's the one
that you love, just...

25:55.563 --> 25:57.898
you just have to be yourself.

25:57.932 --> 26:00.400
Stop trying to force it.

26:00.435 --> 26:04.504
You are a catch, okay?

26:04.539 --> 26:06.873
She's going to realize that
soon enough.

26:17.452 --> 26:18.818
Hey.

26:18.836 --> 26:20.662
You're up.
Feeling better?

26:20.663 --> 26:21.676
Yeah.

26:21.701 --> 26:22.901
You were kind of
in and out a little,

26:23.357 --> 26:25.325
so I took the liberty of
putting your dresses away.

26:25.359 --> 26:27.761
I wasn't sure if they went
on the left or the right,

26:27.795 --> 26:30.046
so I went with the right.

26:34.018 --> 26:35.519
Uh, Sarah, look...

26:38.856 --> 26:41.005
You-you know that I'm,

26:41.030 --> 26:43.795
I'm not the kind of guy who
says things like this,

26:44.011 --> 26:49.182
but... whatever it is that you
thought you needed to hide...

26:49.217 --> 26:53.386
not telling me the truth,
going out on you own like that,

26:53.421 --> 26:58.458
I think it was, uh... a mistake.

27:02.029 --> 27:04.464
I think that you were wrong.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.368
You're right.

27:10.872 --> 27:14.875
When Ryker captured me
in Budapest, I kept thinking

27:14.909 --> 27:16.409
why am I doing it this way?

27:16.444 --> 27:19.095
Why do I feel like I have
to do everything on my own?

27:19.147 --> 27:20.814
But it's what my dad taught me.

27:20.848 --> 27:22.649
It's the way the CIA taught me,

27:22.683 --> 27:25.986
that you can only
ever trust yourself.

27:26.020 --> 27:29.906
But the truth is that
I trust you completely,

27:29.941 --> 27:32.726
and I want to tell you
everything.

27:48.910 --> 27:50.310
Hello?

27:50.344 --> 27:54.514
How are you holding up?

27:54.549 --> 27:59.186
Look, I know what
Ryker made you do.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.920
I know everything.

28:00.938 --> 28:03.256
I was just obeying orders.

28:03.291 --> 28:05.358
There's no need to worry
about that now.

28:05.393 --> 28:07.777
Where's the package?

28:09.630 --> 28:12.599
If I have the package
in my possession, then what?

28:12.633 --> 28:14.985
The CIA would take it
into custody, and then...

28:15.036 --> 28:16.703
Do you guarantee its protection?

28:16.737 --> 28:19.206
You know I can't
make guarantees.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.309
The CIA keeps records
on these kind of things.

28:22.343 --> 28:23.777
Records that a man like Ryker

28:23.811 --> 28:25.495
might be able
to get his hands on.

28:25.546 --> 28:28.114
And who knows what he would do.

28:28.149 --> 28:30.750
He's a wild card.

28:32.453 --> 28:33.787
Agent Walker?

28:35.823 --> 28:37.257
Sarah?

28:37.291 --> 28:40.293
I'm not in possession
of the package, Director.

28:40.328 --> 28:42.395
<i>It must be somewhere else.</i>

28:42.430 --> 28:45.465
This is your home, too.
It doesn't have to be this way.

28:45.499 --> 28:47.174
Mom, I've thought a lot
about this, and, uh, and...

28:48.687 --> 28:49.887
I can't stay.

28:49.904 --> 28:52.239
Because for both
of you to be safe,

28:52.273 --> 28:54.975
well, I can never see you again.

28:58.446 --> 29:01.014
When the CIA recruited me,
I was on the run with Dad,

29:01.048 --> 29:03.016
and we changed our
identities so much

29:03.050 --> 29:04.885
that they never
knew you existed.

29:04.919 --> 29:07.587
And we can't let them
find out about you now.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.589
When you were
a little girl,

29:09.624 --> 29:12.025
all I ever wanted for
you was a normal life.

29:12.059 --> 29:14.728
But you went off
with your father,

29:14.762 --> 29:17.063
and he was never one...

29:19.934 --> 29:22.369
You just... you never got
to go trick-or-treating

29:22.403 --> 29:24.704
or play on the soccer team,

29:24.739 --> 29:27.540
or never got to go to
prom or homecoming.

29:27.575 --> 29:31.378
I just wish I could have given
you at least some of that.

29:34.749 --> 29:37.867
Oh, um... don't forget this.

29:37.902 --> 29:40.320
She likes to be wrapped up
in a blanket.

29:40.354 --> 29:42.038
It... helps her sleep.

29:42.073 --> 29:44.658
And the sound of the rain--
she likes the sound of the rain.

29:44.692 --> 29:46.760
And I've noticed that car rides...
It's okay, honey.

29:48.896 --> 29:51.064
I'll take good care of her.

29:51.098 --> 29:53.934
Yeah, I know.

29:53.968 --> 29:56.036
I know.

29:59.540 --> 30:01.207
Um, Mom?

30:01.242 --> 30:04.311
Yes?

30:06.180 --> 30:11.484
Going to prom and...
and soccer games and...

30:11.519 --> 30:14.938
and... and all those normal
things that you wanted for me--

30:18.125 --> 30:22.629
...will you just make sure
that she gets them?

30:25.132 --> 30:27.117
Of course I will.

30:30.171 --> 30:31.171
Thank you.

30:36.577 --> 30:40.046
So the baby has been with
your mom this whole time?

30:40.081 --> 30:43.116
Yeah. Yeah, now I know
that they're both safe.

30:43.150 --> 30:45.318
Ryker has no idea
where she is.

30:45.353 --> 30:47.854
He has no idea that
my mom ever existed.

30:49.991 --> 30:52.926
I'm so sorry that I never
told you any of this before.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.761
I really am.

30:54.795 --> 30:57.597
I just... I didn't want
to put anybody else in danger.

30:57.615 --> 30:59.933
But thank you for trusting me.

30:59.967 --> 31:02.452
Babe, I love you.

31:09.076 --> 31:11.277
Who's that?

31:11.312 --> 31:12.412
Yeah, what was that?

31:20.421 --> 31:23.056
That's feedback.

31:40.307 --> 31:43.710
Ryker. Oh, my God, he knows
that the baby is with my mom.

31:45.312 --> 31:48.448
I've been looking forward
to this little visit for a long time.

31:48.482 --> 31:50.483
Let's go.

31:59.232 --> 32:01.200
Your call has been forwarded
to an automated...

32:01.234 --> 32:02.434
She's not answering.

32:02.452 --> 32:04.487
I sent her the coordinates.

32:04.538 --> 32:06.038
I just hope she
remembers the signal.

32:29.996 --> 32:31.597
Mom?

32:31.631 --> 32:33.833
Mom!

32:35.068 --> 32:37.186
Please remember
the signal, please.

32:39.539 --> 32:40.573
Did you get
ahold of Morgan?

32:40.607 --> 32:41.841
Not yet,
but I'll keep trying.

32:54.321 --> 32:56.288
Stay there.

33:30.891 --> 33:32.892
I've got her.

33:36.963 --> 33:38.697
Nice apron.

33:38.732 --> 33:40.366
Thanks.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.051
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, hey, guys, sorry,

33:42.085 --> 33:44.503
but this street
is permit parking only.

34:19.005 --> 34:21.623
♪

34:25.594 --> 34:29.782
You came so close
to keeping her safe,

34:29.815 --> 34:33.101

but I'm gonna kill you

34:33.136 --> 34:35.187
and then I'm gonna
kill your mom.

34:35.221 --> 34:36.688
And then after I
get that money,

34:36.723 --> 34:39.358

Hmm?

Get up.

34:49.402 --> 34:50.536
You just don't quit,
do you?

34:51.972 --> 34:55.774

a team,

When the hell
are you gonna learn?

35:13.860 --> 35:15.294
I'm not alone.

35:16.363 --> 35:18.330
She'll never
have nightmares

35:18.365 --> 35:20.833
and she'll never even
know that you existed.

35:22.869 --> 35:24.987
She's going to have the life
that she deserves,

35:25.021 --> 35:27.022
a normal one.

about her.

Growing up mostly
with her father,

she always kept

people get close.

38:18.928 --> 38:19.911
I'm going to pract...

38:19.946 --> 38:21.513
I got to go practice.

38:23.349 --> 38:25.550
Bartowski and his fancy
Chardonnay.

38:25.584 --> 38:27.802
Don't worry, I know where
Sarah keeps the Scotch.

38:27.853 --> 38:29.554
Kitchen, top
left cabinet.

38:29.588 --> 38:31.089
Nice.

38:38.264 --> 38:40.999
You were, uh, pretty
good with Molly today.

38:41.033 --> 38:44.102
Well... you know,
I'm kind of a sweet guy

38:44.136 --> 38:45.737
when I'm not
in douchey

38:45.771 --> 38:49.140
Intersect brain-melting,
life-ruining phase.

38:55.548 --> 38:57.449
Mission accomplished today, huh?

38:57.483 --> 38:58.583
Yep.

38:58.618 --> 39:00.802
Looks like Morgan finally
found the right girl.

39:00.836 --> 39:02.020
I know how he feels.

39:03.506 --> 39:04.789
Aw.

39:04.824 --> 39:06.091
Your favorite.

39:06.125 --> 39:08.593
Honey, you didn't have
to do that.

39:08.627 --> 39:09.828
I wanted to.

39:11.897 --> 39:14.599
I'm the lucky
one now...

39:17.370 --> 39:19.371
Joining the CIA

39:19.405 --> 39:22.140
and giving up
everything you did,

39:22.174 --> 39:24.609
did you ever think
it would lead you here?

39:25.811 --> 39:27.112
No.

39:28.698 --> 39:32.617
No, but, uh, Chuck's taught me
that every now and then,

39:32.651 --> 39:34.319
it's okay to be surprised.

39:37.156 --> 39:40.225
You just love putting me
in my place, don't you?

39:40.259 --> 39:41.493
Yeah.

39:46.532 --> 39:48.333
It's good to have you
back, Agent Walker.

39:48.351 --> 39:51.736
Sometimes when an agent
goes through what you did,

39:51.771 --> 39:53.305
we lose 'em.

39:53.339 --> 39:55.373
Well, you're not going
to lose me, sir...

39:55.408 --> 39:58.009
but I am done with handlers.

39:58.044 --> 39:59.944
Oh, I agree.

39:59.979 --> 40:03.815
In fact, I think that it's
time for you to become one.

40:03.849 --> 40:08.386
I have a new assignment for
you-- something stateside.

40:14.460 --> 40:16.528
You think you can
handle this one?

40:22.068 --> 40:25.003
I like it here.

40:25.037 --> 40:27.572
Me, too.

40:30.209 --> 40:32.911
You know, I, I really want the
life that you imagined for us,

40:32.945 --> 40:36.848
Chuck, but if we go
back to the CIA,

40:36.882 --> 40:38.817
it's just going to be
missions and secrets

40:38.851 --> 40:41.286
that we have no
control over.

40:43.322 --> 40:45.557
What are you saying?

40:45.591 --> 40:50.362
I gave my life to the CIA
for a really long time

40:50.396 --> 40:54.366
and I chose it over my
family and my friends,

40:54.400 --> 40:57.035
and that was the right thing
for me to do at the time,

40:57.069 --> 41:00.138
but... I'm different now.

41:00.172 --> 41:02.507
You know, things
have changed.

41:02.541 --> 41:04.776
You've changed me.

41:07.079 --> 41:09.047
I don't want to go back.

41:09.081 --> 41:12.751
I want to turn down
Beckman's offer.

41:21.227 --> 41:23.228
Okay.

41:23.262 --> 41:25.630
Okay.

41:25.664 --> 41:26.965
We don't need
that bonus

41:26.999 --> 41:30.902
and... we don't need
this house

41:30.936 --> 41:33.338
because all we need
is each other.

41:40.963 --> 41:43.415
Sarah?

41:43.449 --> 41:44.416
Wha-- hey,

41:44.450 --> 41:47.652
hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

41:47.686 --> 41:49.754
I am carving

41:49.789 --> 41:51.756
our names into the frame.

41:51.791 --> 41:54.325
Honey, you know
we don't own this home.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.428
I know,

41:56.462 --> 41:59.514
but we will one day.

41:59.565 --> 42:01.733
Might not be tomorrow
or the next day,

42:01.767 --> 42:03.868
and it might take
us months or years

42:03.903 --> 42:07.806
of hard work, but one day
this will all be ours.

42:10.242 --> 42:11.643
And when it is,
I would like

42:11.677 --> 42:13.211
to always remember
this moment.

42:13.245 --> 42:15.580
So what do you say?

42:15.614 --> 42:17.615
You still in?
