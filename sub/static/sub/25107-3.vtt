WEBVTT

00:10.427 --> 00:12.220
<i>Now the story</i>
<i>of a wealthy family</i>

00:12.303 --> 00:15.473
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.100
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:24.899
<i>It's...</i>

00:28.778 --> 00:31.906
<i>Michael Bluth had just reunited
with his family.</i>

00:32.824 --> 00:35.618
Now that the original Michael's back,
I suppose we don't need two

00:35.702 --> 00:38.496
hands-on-our-hips,
pipe-up-our-rectum scolds.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.914
So you can go.

00:39.998 --> 00:41.207
Back to playing Tobias. Yes.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.711
Exactly, because I am still
a valued family member.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.506
At least until both signatures are
on the divorce papers, which were

00:49.215 --> 00:51.843
so cruelly served to me
from the back seat of my car

00:51.926 --> 00:53.970
by someone who thought
I was a Lyft driver.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.764
Could have been the pink mustache.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.265
Oh, how funny.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.893
Lucille thought it looked pink, too.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.811
That's because everybody's thinking

01:01.936 --> 01:03.480
about Tony Wonder's beard.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.147
- It was pink, right?
- I dyed it

01:05.230 --> 01:07.400
what I assumed was the color
of Michael's skin.

01:07.484 --> 01:10.111
Although now that you're back,
I do wish I had used

01:10.195 --> 01:11.905
a less permanent dye.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.865
I only remember the thing about Tony

01:13.948 --> 01:16.701
because of the "W,"
and his beard was a "W,"

01:16.785 --> 01:19.204
which I thought, you know,
for Wonder, was funny.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.747
You know, it tickled me.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.665
- His beard tickled me.
- Yeah.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.044
And is that part of what
you look so confused about?

01:26.419 --> 01:27.712
It is on the list.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.964
I want to go back
to why you're all in here, though.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.425
Oh, we're shooting footage for Lindsay.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.968
Campaign footage.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.014
<i>You're </i> running for office now?

01:38.098 --> 01:40.809
As a matter of fact, I am.
I want to be part of the problem.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.685
<i>Although, weeks earlier,</i>

01:42.769 --> 01:45.146
<i>Lindsay wasn't eager
to rejoin the family herself.</i>

01:45.230 --> 01:47.649
So, how's Mom? Is she mad at me?

01:47.732 --> 01:49.442
Mad at you?
Why would she be mad at you?

01:50.485 --> 01:51.611
You didn't hear?

01:51.694 --> 01:56.157
There may be some
compromising pictures of me

01:56.241 --> 01:57.867
with the candidate Herbert Love.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.912
If she saw those,
she'd never let me hear the end of it.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.664
Oh, listen,

02:02.747 --> 02:06.417
you're intelligent
and you're wonderful and ethical

02:06.501 --> 02:08.252
and you're great. I mean, don't worry.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.544
She's jealous.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.133
<i>Lindsay had never heard</i>
<i>her father talk this way.</i>

02:13.216 --> 02:15.885
- Jealous of me?
- Mm.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.305
It's probably just because I'm younger.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.932
A <i>puta.</i>

02:21.015 --> 02:22.809
You know, yes, she did mention that.

02:22.892 --> 02:25.562
Maybe it's time to just, uh,
change your ways.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.646
Start fresh.

02:26.729 --> 02:30.316
<i>And perhaps Lindsay would have</i>
<i>gotten a little healthier...</i>

02:31.943 --> 02:34.279
<i>...had the cell reception
been a little worse.</i>

02:34.362 --> 02:35.405
It's Mom.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.781
<i>Mom. Hi.</i>

02:37.532 --> 02:39.492
I need you to run for office.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.412
I told Herbert Love's campaign
that you'd be taking over.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.873
What? No. Mom, I can't do that.

02:45.707 --> 02:49.669
It would mean going up against Lucille 2,
and Sally Sitwell is running her campaign.

02:49.752 --> 02:52.589
Lucille 2 is not going to be a problem.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.757
<i>And Sally hasn't been seen since Cinco.</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:56.176
<i>It was true.</i>

02:56.259 --> 02:58.094
<i>Sally had stolen a lot of money.</i>

02:58.178 --> 03:00.722
If G.O.B. finds out you're straight,
he'll use it to ruin you.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.641
I'll lose the hundred grand
I stole from Lucille Austero

03:03.725 --> 03:05.476
to rebrand you as the gay magician.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.978
<i>But when Sally found out</i>

03:07.061 --> 03:10.440
<i>Lucille Austero's political opponent
had been knocked out...</i>

03:11.524 --> 03:13.484
<i>she chose to get out of town</i>

03:13.568 --> 03:16.070
<i>before people started asking questions.</i>

03:16.738 --> 03:19.282
<i>- She packed light.</i>
- I'm wondering if someone could help me.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.284
- Somebody say "Wonder"?
- Not wonder.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.994
- No one's wondering!
<i>- Just Tony.</i>

03:23.077 --> 03:24.621
<i>So, you're unopposed...</i>

03:25.163 --> 03:26.664
and I need you.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.249
<i> It was the first time</i>

03:28.333 --> 03:31.169
<i>Lindsay's mother had ever told her
she needed her.</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:32.170
You said it.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.298
I said it!

03:35.381 --> 03:36.966
<i>Well, she read it.</i>

03:37.550 --> 03:40.303
<i>George Sr.
and G.O.B. had also been in Mexico</i>

03:40.386 --> 03:43.223
<i>and were growing tired
of their fruitless peacocking.</i>

03:46.809 --> 03:50.939
I hate everything about my life,
including you.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.441
Well, that's not the horniest thing
I've heard.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.901
Daddy not horny.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.945
Yeah, I guess these shirts

03:57.028 --> 03:59.239
kind of pumped up the pressure on that.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.158
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.329
I feel like one of these bulls
on my breasts.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.707
His whole life,
he's bred to be the strongest

04:09.791 --> 04:12.835
and the toughest
and he's got to have the biggest balls.

04:12.919 --> 04:13.836
Why?

04:14.295 --> 04:17.507
So when you're in your prime,
they can drug you

04:17.589 --> 04:20.009
and throw you out
in front of a crowd of people

04:20.093 --> 04:21.636
who just want to see you die

04:22.136 --> 04:25.223
so some guy
in crushed velvet pants can come out

04:25.306 --> 04:28.685
and just stick a sword in you.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.813
You're a bull who wants
to stick it in everybody,

04:31.896 --> 04:34.983
and everybody ends up sticking it in you.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.777
<i>And G.O.B. started opening up, too.</i>

04:37.860 --> 04:39.654
I tried to buy those velvet pants.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.408
But I chickened out
and got these shirts instead.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.412
I have a friend, this guy Tony...

04:47.495 --> 04:48.746
not a friend.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.665
He's nice.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.751
He had a face like mine...

04:56.087 --> 04:57.046
but same.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.550
♪ <i>I started a joke</i> ♪

05:00.633 --> 05:01.926
Hello, darkness.

05:02.010 --> 05:06.014
- ♪ <i>Which started the whole world crying</i> ♪
- Sorry, I'm taken.

05:06.681 --> 05:07.807
What's that from?

05:07.890 --> 05:10.310
<i>G.O.B.'s transformation...</i>

05:10.893 --> 05:13.229
<i>- ...would also be interrupted.</i>
- It's your mother.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.814
We're going back to work.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.525
You're going to be the new face
of the company.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.989
That was Mom.
She wants me back.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.117
My God. Must be nice to be wanted,

05:26.534 --> 05:28.244
even if it's just your mom.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.955
Oh, cry me a blizzard, snowflake.
I gotta run.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.874
You got this, right?

05:32.957 --> 05:34.083
Look who's horny now.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.794
G.O.B. <i>wasn't the only family member</i>

05:36.878 --> 05:39.422
<i>on the verge of growing in Mexico.</i>

05:40.214 --> 05:42.425
As you can see,
the reward is simply in the giving.

05:42.508 --> 05:44.385
Most people, they cannot resist

05:44.469 --> 05:46.220
taking advantage of the truly vulnerable.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.306
<i>When she, too, received a call.</i>

05:48.681 --> 05:50.058
Oh.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.352
- <i>Mom?</i>
- No, it's Lindsay.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.521
Uh, uh...
Mom. Yes. To you.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.273
<i>Of course I'm Mom.</i>

05:57.815 --> 05:59.525
I'm running for Congress,

05:59.609 --> 06:04.405
and I don't have a campaign manager
and I need you.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.450
<i>Maeby had never heard</i>
<i>her mother this vulnerable.</i>

06:07.533 --> 06:10.536
Yeah. Sounds great. I'm in.

06:13.664 --> 06:16.417
Hey. It is hard to resist.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.587
Taking advantage of the vulnerable.

06:20.505 --> 06:23.091
- And I'm her campaign manager.
- Is that Maeby?

06:23.174 --> 06:25.843
Oh, my gosh. I didn't even recognize you.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.929
It's a teenager thing.
I could never pull that off.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.514
They want to look old, we want to look...

06:29.597 --> 06:31.641
You don't look very young.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.898
Oh, the laughter.
That's why we're gonna get the award.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.525
No one's taking it away from us!

06:40.608 --> 06:41.526
Let them try.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.528
The award?

06:43.611 --> 06:45.988
Oh, look at him, like he doesn't know.

06:46.072 --> 06:48.533
- We're going to win Family of the Year.
- Family of the Month.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.202
- Year?! Are you for...
- Mother Family

06:51.285 --> 06:53.037
- of the Mother Year!
- Of the year.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.455
We just found out!

06:54.539 --> 06:56.332
- Wow.
- We're getting the Golden Anchor Award.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.334
Guess they think
our family's been an anchor

06:58.418 --> 07:00.086
of the O.C. community.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.879
Huh. Who is giving you this award?

07:01.963 --> 07:04.674
Check it, Mike.
My anchor is giving us the award.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.717
See, she used to be
an Orange County weather girl,

07:06.801 --> 07:08.428
which is just tits, teeth and ass, right?

07:09.011 --> 07:11.264
Now she's the host of <i>O.C. Can You Say,</i>

07:11.347 --> 07:14.600
which is tits, teeth, public affairs, ass,

07:14.684 --> 07:16.102
some light interviews.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.229
I mean, it's so much more responsibility!

07:18.312 --> 07:20.523
He's making it sound more important
than it really is.

07:20.606 --> 07:21.524
Is he?

07:21.607 --> 07:25.695
She was married to that news anchor
who said such horrible things

07:25.778 --> 07:28.698
about me when I was trying
to save Buster with that boat.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.366
- John Beard.
- Yeah.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.119
She's my Beard now.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.912
What I meant was,
what organization

07:34.996 --> 07:36.914
- is giving you the award?
- Well,

07:36.998 --> 07:39.709
technically,
it's from the Bluth-Austero Company.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.752
Oh, I see.
So you're giving it to yourself.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.464
Well, it's mostly from the Austero side.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.299
Perfect timing for my campaign.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.633
Our Lindsay.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.219
I've never been less ashamed of her.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.681
- Did I say what I think I said?
- Yes, you did.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.853
Hey, man, look who's joining in!

07:59.687 --> 08:01.147
Where is Lucille Austero?

08:03.000 --> 08:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:13.242 --> 08:14.327
No one knows.

08:15.786 --> 08:16.829
Oh.

08:16.913 --> 08:21.417
She flew the coop.
In the middle of running for Congress.

08:21.501 --> 08:25.421
I mean, no one remembers seeing her
since Cinco de Cuatro.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.840
And we didn't want the crew in our house.

08:27.924 --> 08:31.219
No, and it was okay with Lucille 2.
She gave us the key.

08:31.302 --> 08:34.679
It was during the 1992
African-American riots,

08:34.764 --> 08:36.307
and they had every right.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.100
- Every right.
- Every right.

08:38.893 --> 08:39.977
Mm.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.313
I find all of this...
it's just very hard to believe.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.149
Tell you
what is hard beyond belief.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.735
My God, I wish you could get
a feel on these two things

08:47.818 --> 08:49.529
that Joni's got going over here.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.364
They're like two geodes!

08:51.447 --> 08:52.823
- Hmm.
- You can feel them.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.825
I can't. My go-to joke

08:54.909 --> 08:57.787
is that these are the best two things
John Beard's money can buy.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.080
That's a go-to.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.249
Now you're back.
You'll bring George Michael.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.751
We'll show the world
what a great family we are.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.337
Oh, that's good.
Family is so important to me.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.506
- Sometimes my own family.
<i>-  Actually,</i>

09:08.589 --> 09:10.550
<i>Michael hadn't spoken
to his son in months</i>

09:10.633 --> 09:13.261
<i>and didn't even know he had been
in Mexico.</i>

09:13.344 --> 09:15.763
Can we get four pretzels, two Cokes,
and two Mexican Cokes?

09:16.514 --> 09:17.932
My friend, you're in <i>México.</i>

09:18.224 --> 09:20.184
We have Coke and American Coke.

09:21.727 --> 09:22.853
I didn't wish to offend.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.439
I'm sorry. I'm probably grumpy
because I was out

09:25.523 --> 09:27.441
late last night, raping and murdering.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.235
Not cool. I wouldn't joke about that.

09:29.318 --> 09:32.989
I rape and murder, and I joke.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.616
<i>And feeling unwelcome in this land</i>

09:35.700 --> 09:37.910
<i>that was still pretty welcoming,</i>

09:37.994 --> 09:39.954
<i>George Michael returned home,</i>

09:41.247 --> 09:44.375
<i>but wasn't quite ready
to deal with real life.</i>

09:46.627 --> 09:49.171
<i>And seeing his father had left town,</i>

09:49.672 --> 09:53.759
<i>and perhaps not ready to return
to the responsibilities he'd left,</i>

09:54.552 --> 09:56.554
<i>he decided to ease back in,</i>

09:56.637 --> 09:58.681
<i>returning to his childhood home.</i>

09:58.764 --> 10:01.434
Hello? Here to clean the windows!

10:02.643 --> 10:04.437
<i>And upon finding it empty,</i>

10:04.520 --> 10:07.648
<i>he soon began what can
only be described as...</i>

10:07.732 --> 10:10.192
<i>Total regression!</i>

10:16.032 --> 10:17.158
<i>Dangerous Cousins!</i>

10:18.701 --> 10:19.994
Oh, my God, Quicken.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.624
God, it's so much smaller
than I remember.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.292
<i> Perhaps it was a yearning</i>

10:26.375 --> 10:29.295
<i>to go back to a simpler,
less complicated time.</i>

10:29.837 --> 10:33.591
<i>But there was no denying he was older
and more mature.</i>

10:35.051 --> 10:37.720
<i>Not to mention, looking for love.</i>

10:53.152 --> 10:55.446
<i>But aside from a few setbacks,</i>

10:55.613 --> 10:58.824
<i>George Michael was enjoying
a break from responsibility.</i>

10:58.908 --> 11:01.202
For scenario two,
you just found out

11:01.285 --> 11:03.412
that your Darth Vader figure
is dating your girlfriend,

11:03.496 --> 11:06.957
and you find out he knew she was your...
Whatever. Who gives a shit?

11:07.041 --> 11:09.377
As usual, guys,
just apply your own scenarios to these.

11:09.460 --> 11:14.131
<i>Soon he, too, was teaching a course</i>
<i>in a program of his own creation.</i>

11:14.215 --> 11:15.257
Go left.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.302
<i>He even inspired a certain move</i>
<i>that would eventually appear</i>

11:18.386 --> 11:23.349
<i>two years later
in a Han Solo origin picture.</i>

11:24.100 --> 11:27.561
<i>But the desire to return to a simpler time</i>

11:27.645 --> 11:29.438
<i>might explain why his heart raced</i>

11:29.522 --> 11:31.899
<i>when Maeby texted him a message.</i>

11:32.692 --> 11:34.402
Shit.

11:40.991 --> 11:43.285
♪ <i>Honey to the bear, baby</i> ♪

11:43.369 --> 11:45.913
<i>George Michael gave more thought</i>
<i>to a response</i>

11:45.996 --> 11:47.915
<i>than perhaps was necessary...</i>

11:53.379 --> 11:54.672
♪ <i>Yes, I do</i> ♪

11:55.506 --> 11:56.924
♪ <i>Yes, I do</i> ♪

11:59.218 --> 12:02.388
<i>...and wasn't quite proud
of his final selection.</i>

12:02.763 --> 12:05.391
♪ <i>Like honey to the bear, baby</i> ♪

12:07.435 --> 12:09.145
There. That way...

12:10.229 --> 12:11.439
She can figure it out.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.607
<i>And he headed off to the penthouse,</i>

12:15.109 --> 12:17.653
<i>lost in an adolescent fantasy...</i>

12:17.737 --> 12:20.573
- Hi... don't like it.
<i>- ...that he was soon shaken out of.</i>

12:20.656 --> 12:21.532
What? My hair?

12:21.615 --> 12:23.200
No, no, I like it. I just, uh,

12:23.284 --> 12:25.703
don't like that I'm just seeing it now.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.456
I guess I was picturing you at 16.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.041
But I-I don't know why I... do that.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.878
- But why did you do that?
- Well, truthfully...

12:34.962 --> 12:37.423
No, I'll just tell you the truth:
it's a wig.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.967
Now that I'm working
for my mom's campaign,

12:40.050 --> 12:41.427
I thought a gray-haired daughter

12:41.510 --> 12:44.180
would add some years to her,
but, turns out, nope.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.682
She thinks it's a cool new thing
and it makes her look hip.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.058
Everything I've given her

12:48.142 --> 12:51.145
to do or say has only made her
go up in the polls.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.938
It's like the more offensive it is,

12:53.022 --> 12:54.982
- the more people get behind her.
<i>- It was true.</i>

12:55.065 --> 12:57.777
Remember, just stick to the words. Okay?

12:58.569 --> 13:00.613
<i>She had her mother mock a reporter</i>

13:00.696 --> 13:02.948
<i>- who had a speech problem...</i>
- This so-called reporter

13:03.032 --> 13:04.825
from the <i>Wee Guardian </i> says I was right.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.410
Now, suddenly, she's...

13:06.494 --> 13:08.496
"Perhaps I've recalled incorrectly.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.915
I'm positively knackered."

13:10.998 --> 13:12.958
The candidate made no fans in Wee Britain,

13:13.042 --> 13:15.044
but on the other side of the Anaheim pond,

13:15.127 --> 13:17.838
the comment only made her more popular.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.423
<i>...and release a hot mic tape.</i>

13:19.507 --> 13:21.550
...after the damning
hot mic piece surfaced.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.428
<i>Although, remember,</i>
<i>this was in 2015,</i>

13:24.512 --> 13:26.680
<i>and many of the offensive comments</i>

13:27.306 --> 13:29.809
<i>almost seem quaint by today's standards.</i>

13:29.892 --> 13:31.602
- Did you get that?
- Oh, yeah.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.561
Okay.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.065
While shocking,
the video seems to have only given her

13:36.148 --> 13:37.775
a big rise in the polls.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.069
It certainly had that effect on me.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.904
- Not necessary!
- Don't sack me.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.322
<i>She keeps polling higher.</i>

13:43.405 --> 13:44.573
What am I doing right?

13:44.657 --> 13:48.619
Well, it probably doesn't help that,
except for you, she's running unopposed.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.372
Yeah. That's why I came up with
the idea for us to kiss.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.375
So the kissing is part of a plan?

13:54.458 --> 13:56.710
Yeah. I thought we could do it
when the whole family

13:56.794 --> 13:58.879
is on camera getting
the Family of the Year Award.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.257
Family of the Year Award?
Who'd give us that?

14:01.799 --> 14:04.051
- We're giving it to ourselves.
- Right.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.970
Still doesn't seem like
we'd get the votes.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.847
So when my mom's giving the speech,

14:07.930 --> 14:10.266
we'll be in the background,
and we're just going at it.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.767
And I'm like,

14:11.851 --> 14:13.519
"Why have I never thought of that before?"

14:14.353 --> 14:15.437
Kind of feels like you have.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.274
To me, it seems like what you really want

14:18.357 --> 14:20.442
is for your mother
to see you for who you are.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.362
Why don't you write a speech
for her to say about you,

14:23.445 --> 14:25.239
about how lovely and smart you are,

14:26.031 --> 14:28.534
how you've blossomed as a young woman

14:28.617 --> 14:30.953
into this incredibly beautiful
and special person

14:31.036 --> 14:33.831
that anyone would be lucky
to get to share their life with.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.584
I think I see
where you're going with this.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.502
An incredibly attractive,

14:38.586 --> 14:41.338
incredibly rare and precious gem.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.341
And then, I open my mouth,

14:44.758 --> 14:46.844
and I have these rotted out meth teeth.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.971
And I'm like,
"Then why do I gotta my cousin

14:49.054 --> 14:51.473
for some meth money, Mom?"
You know, or something like that.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.517
- I feel like we're circling it.
- Yeah.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.228
I don't know, maybe that's just a shade

14:56.353 --> 14:57.688
unnecessarily cruel.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.442
Well,
at least I didn't punch her in the face.

15:01.525 --> 15:04.653
Ah, I still feel so weird.
I haven't even seen my dad since that day.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.572
Yeah. He seems fine.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.658
- Oh, you've seen him?
- Yeah. He's across the hall.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.453
- Wait, who is?
- Everyone.

15:12.536 --> 15:15.539
- Your dad, my mom, the whole family.
- My dad's across the hall?

15:15.623 --> 15:17.333
<i>Where Michael's father currently had</i>

15:17.416 --> 15:19.084
<i>his own son in a panic.</i>

15:19.168 --> 15:20.669
- No, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.755
I'm fine. It's just, uh,
I like, you know...

15:22.838 --> 15:24.506
I just like the feeling of, uh...

15:24.590 --> 15:26.800
...feeling something.

15:26.884 --> 15:29.887
It's just nice to have
some control over one's life.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.640
But your mother is a wonderful person!

15:32.973 --> 15:34.516
I've screamed the same thing many times

15:34.600 --> 15:36.143
I was worried she was in earshot.

15:36.685 --> 15:37.937
You sure you two are okay?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.272
I mean, the last I heard,
you two were getting a divorce,

15:40.356 --> 15:42.524
and now it seems like everything's just...

15:42.608 --> 15:43.651
- Forgotten?
- Yeah.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.653
You know our family motto.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.155
We forget, but we never forgive.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.157
I remember the framed needlepoint.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.410
You'll see. In life,
you don't want to carry that much hate.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.663
Although, by not forgiving,

15:55.746 --> 15:58.290
you're throwing everything out
and <i>just </i> keeping the hate.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.043
Well, how do you think
she keeps that figure?

16:01.126 --> 16:03.504
No. Okay, I'm going for a feeling.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.838
- Let's get inside.
- I'm fine.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.465
- That's enough air.
- I'm fine. Hey!

16:06.548 --> 16:08.634
What's that trophy gonna look like, huh?

16:08.717 --> 16:10.928
Oh! Everyone gets a trophy, huh, Pop?

16:11.011 --> 16:12.846
- Well...
- When I was a kid,

16:12.930 --> 16:15.891
you said, "You want a trophy?
Try harder, G.O.B."

16:15.975 --> 16:17.434
Huh. Well, maybe I...

16:17.518 --> 16:19.311
- did something right, huh?
- But I was like,

16:19.395 --> 16:21.563
"But you gave one to everybody else.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.607
What happened to
everybody gets a trophy?"

16:23.691 --> 16:25.651
There was that then.
It was getting started, but...

16:25.734 --> 16:28.404
Meanwhile,
the guy who could've tried harder

16:28.487 --> 16:31.907
is now giving it to the not super young,
obviously,

16:31.991 --> 16:35.035
but still fairly well known
local TV host whose breasts...

16:35.119 --> 16:37.788
and you're gonna be surprised
to hear this coming from me...

16:37.871 --> 16:39.665
may be a little bit too hard.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.792
High class problem, huh, Mike?

16:41.875 --> 16:43.752
I wish you could get a feel
next time, Mike.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.713
There is something not right with those.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.007
Yeah, well,
I'm in town such a short time,

16:48.090 --> 16:49.800
- so next time.
- Well...

16:49.883 --> 16:51.051
One less trophy, huh, Mom?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.637
There's one trophy: The Golden Anchor,

16:53.721 --> 16:55.264
and Lindsay gets it.

16:55.347 --> 16:58.058
Wait, what?
For Family of the Year?! No!

16:58.142 --> 17:00.060
We need her to be the center of this.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.854
She's the one running for office.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.731
What about Dad?
You're the head of the family.

17:03.814 --> 17:06.275
You're the alpha. Or me, for that matter.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.483
I am the CEO. Mom said.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.112
Fine, I'll get trophies for everyone.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.114
Everyone gets a trophy.

17:12.195 --> 17:14.406
Count me out.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.827
- Fine. Everyone but G.O.B.
- No!

17:18.037 --> 17:19.538
<i>You sure I didn't mention that</i>
<i>in the text?</i>

17:19.621 --> 17:20.998
Yeah. I read that thing down.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.458
- Hmm.
- Should I go say hi to him?

17:22.540 --> 17:24.084
I haven't seen my Darth since I hit him.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.002
What if he asks me about Rebel?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.756
That's the love of his life,
that he gave up for me,

17:28.839 --> 17:30.549
and I haven't even called her once.

17:30.632 --> 17:31.633
Just tell him that.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.094
- The truth, huh?
- Yeah.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.679
Sometimes, the truth can hurt a man

17:35.763 --> 17:38.557
more than the most brutally fashioned lie.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.184
I should get out of here.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.227
<i>Is anyone else noticing</i>

17:42.311 --> 17:46.774
that the family isn't quite,
uh, as we remember them?

17:46.857 --> 17:49.860
- In what way?
- That is not Buster.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.237
Oh, I'm in.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.198
Uh, Buster,

17:54.281 --> 17:58.077
oh, um, it's about time you got here,
um, to the penthouse.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.704
Did the skit start?
I don't have the hook thing.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.539
- Hey, what's happening?
- Shh!

18:03.665 --> 18:06.293
Can I just do this
with my hand instead, Tobias?

18:06.376 --> 18:08.337
Michael. I'm Michael.

18:08.420 --> 18:11.173
Just stay in it, Murphy...
uh, Buster, stay in...

18:11.256 --> 18:13.467
He did a fantastic job as Buster

18:13.550 --> 18:16.762
in the campaign interviews,
so I will get him there,

18:17.137 --> 18:18.806
uh, for the awards ceremony, I will.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.557
He's a young actor.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.142
I don't really want to be an actor.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.770
- It's not what I want to do.
- Oh, and, uh,

18:24.853 --> 18:27.314
who's making you be an actor, Buster?

18:27.397 --> 18:28.440
He's talking to you...

18:28.524 --> 18:30.984
- Shut up, Lindsay!
- Li... your sister.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.487
Your sis... Lindsay... sister.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.572
Who's making you be an actor?

18:35.656 --> 18:37.241
- My father?
- What?

18:37.324 --> 18:38.867
Who? Him?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.577
How could you do this to our son?

18:40.661 --> 18:42.704
- His son. Your son. I...
- Okay.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.289
I have to pull myself out of this part.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.209
I'm going in and out of Michael
like a cuckoo clock bird.

18:47.334 --> 18:50.295
Okay, so, I'm Michael,
uh, G.O.B. is G.O.B.,

18:51.213 --> 18:52.172
Michael is no one.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.591
And opening night energy, Places and re...

18:54.675 --> 18:57.469
- Peas and carrots. Red leather...
- Tobias! Hey, hey!

18:57.553 --> 19:01.807
- We do not need a Buster, okay?
- That's right! Michael has him.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.934
Indeed,
and here he comes.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.394
- Has who?
- Has who?

19:05.477 --> 19:06.562
Buster.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.313
Y-You said you'd look after him.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.692
- That's the first I'm hearing about it.
- We've heard about it.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.820
Michael, why are you lying about
not having Buster with you?

19:14.903 --> 19:17.531
- Oh, no, I'm not lying about anything.
<i>- Well, he kind of was.</i>

19:17.614 --> 19:20.826
<i>As months earlier,
he had laid out a scheme</i>

19:20.909 --> 19:23.579
<i>to make it seem like
Buster was a missing person.</i>

19:23.662 --> 19:26.790
So, we gotta wait about 48 hours
before we declare you missing.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.876
- Then they put out an APB.
<i>- At which point,</i>

19:28.959 --> 19:31.253
<i>Buster was to go to the police station
and say...</i>

19:31.336 --> 19:32.838
"You were looking for me.
Here I am."

19:32.921 --> 19:35.299
Let them race back into town
and save everyone for a change.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.926
In fact, I keep forgetting to ask,
uh, what was it

19:38.010 --> 19:41.722
that brought everyone back
together in town this time?

19:41.805 --> 19:43.932
Well, Lucille 2 was missing,

19:44.016 --> 19:46.768
and we had an obligation
to look after the company.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.104
So, it's not because of Buster.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.981
- I see. Listen, I don't...
- Yeah.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.192
<i>What Michael didn't know</i>
<i>was that while the police</i>

19:53.275 --> 19:54.943
<i>had gotten ahold of Buster...</i>

19:55.027 --> 19:56.737
You think that's me?

19:56.820 --> 19:58.405
<i>...they were more concerned</i>

19:58.488 --> 19:59.823
<i>with a different missing person.</i>

19:59.907 --> 20:02.743
I mean, that guy obviously
has a giant rubber hand,

20:02.826 --> 20:06.079
and I have a giant melted hand
that smells like Bounce.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.832
<i>I'm in the movie.</i>

20:08.916 --> 20:10.834
Okay, that's definitely me.

20:10.918 --> 20:14.504
I'm just surprised to see it,
since I'm pretty sure I erased that video.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.507
You sure you don't want an attorney?

20:17.591 --> 20:20.510
No. Michael was very clear about that.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.263
- I'm just a missing person.
- Not anymore.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.349
We don't need a bad cop.
Go home.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.142
- See your kid.
- Thanks, Rick.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.435
That's why you're the good cop.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.730
I don't know what lesson you're trying
to teach me, but you're back.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.691
You're probably hiding Buster.
I mean, who knows? It's just...

20:34.775 --> 20:36.485
Not my problem anymore,
in any event, okay?

20:36.568 --> 20:37.861
I got my own son to worry about.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.613
I am, uh, I'm leaving. Goodbye.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.156
- Bye.
- I will not be back this time.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.658
It's all about my son.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.118
That was so helpful, thank you.
If you could...

20:46.453 --> 20:48.413
- Get your stuff. Let's get out of here.
- Dad.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.334
- Hey.
- Oh!

20:53.585 --> 20:55.671
Hey. Hey, son.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.882
Oh, my goodness, look who it is.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.343
- I was just gonna call you.
- This is, uh...

21:01.426 --> 21:03.470
- Back in town or...?
- Are you, um...

21:03.553 --> 21:05.847
Briefly. You going
to the family thing that we're...

21:06.265 --> 21:07.724
- Giving to ourselves? No.
- Huh? Yeah.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.685
- I, uh, can't make it.
- Yeah? No?

21:09.768 --> 21:11.478
- Should I tell them?
- Well, you know, listen,

21:11.561 --> 21:13.939
I-I wasn't gonna go,
so don't-don't not go,

21:14.022 --> 21:15.023
because I'm... you know.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.775
- You're the reason I <i>would </i> go.
- Oh, yeah?

21:16.858 --> 21:19.111
- I just have some plans, so I can't. Yeah.
- Sweet.

21:19.194 --> 21:22.447
You got plans, huh?
Well, we make plans, and God laughs.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.448
- That's right.
- Right?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.951
- No, I always want to make plans, but...
- Hmm.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.661
You don't want to be laughed at.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.997
Tell me. Yeah. Well, I won't laugh.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.290
Do you have plans with Rebel?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.835
- Uh, yeah, I do, yeah. I do. Yeah, no.
- Good for you guys.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.295
It's-it's fun stuff, yeah.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.339
Stuff I think, even if you weren't God,
you'd find funny.

21:39.423 --> 21:40.882
You can't ask for more than that.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.385
But that's none of my business, yeah?

21:44.428 --> 21:46.930
Only reason I ask,
'cause I'm going on a scuba trip.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.017
Um, yeah,
came back in town to get my gear.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.643
Only reason I'm here, um, you know.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.562
It's a last-minute thing.
Several weeks at sea.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.397
- You'd hate it. So, yes.
- Yeah, not my thing.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.983
- I shouldn't have even asked you.
- Oh, did you ask?

21:58.066 --> 22:00.110
Ah... I don't want to inter...

22:00.193 --> 22:02.237
You shouldn't cancel your plans
with Rebel, you know.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.156
- Rain check.
- Uh, it's tomorrow or...?

22:04.239 --> 22:06.783
- Hmm? We leave today, so, yeah.
- Ah.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.201
God's probably...

22:08.285 --> 22:10.662
- I can almost hear him laughing, you know?
- Wow, yeah.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.373
Although, maybe, I imagine,
it doesn't make him laugh anymore.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.625
I mean, so much of life is, uh, plans.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.669
It would just be the same joke
over and over.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.837
So he's...

22:19.796 --> 22:21.882
- It's not funny anymore.
- What's he laughing at?

22:21.965 --> 22:23.800
Hey.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.260
You happy?

22:25.719 --> 22:26.636
Oh, man.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.598
You know, in truth, it's, uh,

22:29.681 --> 22:31.808
it's-it's been a while since I've seen...

22:33.852 --> 22:35.937
- you, first of all, but, um...
- Yep.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.481
The thing with, um...

22:37.564 --> 22:39.316
So, Rebel, you know, 'cause she...

22:39.441 --> 22:42.152
I wanted to say, between the two of you,
you know,

22:42.694 --> 22:45.489
if you ever felt like...
Because, like, she's indicated

22:45.572 --> 22:47.616
that things were...
I don't know what she said,

22:47.699 --> 22:51.036
but maybe things were not quite
wrapped up completely with...

22:51.119 --> 22:52.621
- Between me and her?
- Yeah.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.958
She said that I left things unfinished?
Hang on.

22:57.042 --> 23:00.670
That's got me, that's got me spinning out,
'cause, uh...

23:01.046 --> 23:03.090
That could be how she talks.
You know how she is.

23:03.173 --> 23:06.927
No, I-I think I was-was
pretty clear that I...

23:07.010 --> 23:08.220
You know, I broke up with her.

23:08.303 --> 23:12.182
You know, I show up there,
I got a cactus, for God's sakes,

23:12.265 --> 23:13.350
you know, which is...

23:13.433 --> 23:15.602
that's the universal sign
for "things are over."

23:15.685 --> 23:18.605
No, she must have just thought
that you would also, um...

23:20.565 --> 23:21.400
Say it.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.776
Yeah. Say it.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.321
Oh. Yeah, I did. I said lots of things.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.157
I'm standing there, you had just left.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.409
- Ciao.
<i>- Bella.</i>

23:31.326 --> 23:32.911
<i> When Michael ran into Rebel</i>

23:32.994 --> 23:34.913
<i>- leaving her apartment...</i>
- That's for me.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.581
<i>...but she had some bad news.</i>

23:36.665 --> 23:40.001
It's not gonna work out between us.
I just wanted to tell you in person.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.338
<i>Michael didn't know why he said</i>
<i>the next thing out of his mouth.</i>

23:43.422 --> 23:46.800
<i>Maybe it was relief
that he didn't have to break up with her,</i>

23:46.883 --> 23:49.219
<i>but for some reason, he came up with...</i>

23:49.678 --> 23:53.348
Well, if you ever change your mind,
I ain't going nowhere.

23:54.975 --> 23:59.312
Uh, I was afraid that maybe
I was too hard on her, verbally. You know?

23:59.396 --> 24:00.564
And then, I, you know...

24:00.647 --> 24:03.150
Plus I had to leave
for a couple of months for work.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.901
- Movie stuff?
- Hmm?

24:06.153 --> 24:07.279
Mexico.

24:07.737 --> 24:10.699
Hope she's not getting a signal
from you that you are not

24:11.199 --> 24:13.160
fully into her because you're worried

24:13.243 --> 24:14.995
that maybe I've got
some unfinished business,

24:15.078 --> 24:17.080
- so you're holding back?
- No. No, I'm all in.

24:17.164 --> 24:20.375
<i> Actually,</i>
<i>the only contact George Michael had had</i>

24:20.459 --> 24:23.170
<i>with Rebel was watching
one of her movies,</i>

24:23.253 --> 24:24.963
<i>with a Shane and three Noahs.</i>

24:25.046 --> 24:27.257
<i>And you can say goodbye to these!</i>

24:28.550 --> 24:29.843
Maybe I do miss her.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.346
No, I told her. You know, I even said,
"Y'all are it for me."

24:33.430 --> 24:35.348
- You know.
- Go a step further and say,

24:35.432 --> 24:37.184
- "Y'all ain't going nowhere."
- She's it. I don't know

24:37.267 --> 24:39.936
why she wouldn't think I was...
wasn't going nowhere.

24:40.604 --> 24:41.771
Pa.

24:43.231 --> 24:45.358
Oh, that's me. Um, good.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.569
All right, well, are you going down or...?

24:47.652 --> 24:49.988
- No. I forgot my bag.
- Well, it's good to see...

24:57.287 --> 24:58.580
- Ciao.
<i>- Bella.</i>

25:05.337 --> 25:08.256
That's it, I'm out of here!

25:08.590 --> 25:11.551
<i>Michael returns for his bag.</i>

25:11.635 --> 25:13.595
Okay, I get it.
Is that supposed to be me?

25:13.678 --> 25:15.847
No, that's my impression
of Tobias doing you.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.474
Wait, what? But that...

25:18.642 --> 25:21.144
Oh, that's it. I am out of here.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.776
Tobias doing Tobias. Yep?

25:29.319 --> 25:31.363
I don't care. I'm...

25:31.863 --> 25:32.864
All right.

25:33.448 --> 25:38.119
<i>And Buster wonders why Michael</i>
<i>isn't doing Michael.</i>

25:38.203 --> 25:40.330
Why hasn't Michael come back?

25:40.413 --> 25:43.291
What happened to
"Michael always comes back"?

25:46.211 --> 25:47.587
Oh, God. Oh, God.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.882
Mm. Uh... okay.
