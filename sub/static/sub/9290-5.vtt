00:13.723 --> 00:16.559
- What's wrong?
- Keeler.

00:16.643 --> 00:20.813
He's bringing your ex-husband into this
debate, the investigation into his company.

00:20.897 --> 00:25.151
Then face Keeler's lie with the truth and
trust that the people can tell the difference.

00:26.236 --> 00:29.030
- What's going on? Where's Tony?
- He's been shot. 

00:29.113 --> 00:31.616
- How bad?
- He was hit in the neck. He's alive.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.994
They're getting him to the hospital.
You're in command.

00:35.078 --> 00:38.164
 Deliver Ramón Salazar
to the Van Nuys Dam. 

00:38.248 --> 00:41.793
Whoever sent this message is
controlling Singer's movements.

00:41.876 --> 00:45.129
We have two hours to find him
before they release the virus.

00:45.213 --> 00:48.716
- What are you into, Kyle?
- These cops came to my apartment,

00:48.800 --> 00:53.054
saying something about using me
to bring some disease into the country.

00:53.137 --> 00:54.180
A disease?

00:55.431 --> 00:56.975
Go! Run!

00:59.561 --> 01:01.271
No!

01:04.691 --> 01:06.526
- You going to see Salazar?
- Yeah.

01:06.609 --> 01:10.280
- Dad said questioning him is a waste of time.
- Sitting around here is a waste of time.

01:10.363 --> 01:13.116
I need you to generate
a prisoner transfer document.

01:13.199 --> 01:16.035
- What's this about?
- I need to move Ramón Salazar.

01:16.119 --> 01:19.289
This has priority clearance.
No one at CTU's supposed to know.

01:19.372 --> 01:23.668
Either I hand over Ramón Salazar,
or his brother will release the virus.

01:23.751 --> 01:27.547
I understand that this is an impossible
choice. I have another option for you.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.675
Ramón Salazar would be broken out
and delivered to him.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.219
Sounds like quite a plan, Jack.
Who'll break Salazar out?

01:33.303 --> 01:35.471
I will, sir.

01:35.555 --> 01:38.308
This would be my last assignment.

01:38.391 --> 01:40.852
If you play this cool
you're walking out of here now.

01:43.438 --> 01:46.232
Open the cell blocks now.

01:49.569 --> 01:51.070
Move!

02:00.663 --> 02:05.585
Good evening to those on the East
Coast and good afternoon in the west.

02:05.668 --> 02:09.464
Welcome to the first of three debates
between President Palmer

02:09.547 --> 02:11.341
and Senator John Keeler.

02:11.424 --> 02:14.719
We'll begin tonight with a two-minute
opening statement,

02:14.802 --> 02:18.681
followed by the first question,
which will go to President Palmer,

02:18.765 --> 02:23.520
this decided by a coin-flip
backstage just moments ago.

02:23.603 --> 02:26.105
How you feeling?

02:26.189 --> 02:29.484
Is that a medical question or a personal one?

02:29.567 --> 02:32.612
- Both.
- I'm fine.

02:32.695 --> 02:35.240
It'll be conducted
within the rules agreed to

02:35.323 --> 02:38.660
by each member of the debate
and by the two campaigns.

02:38.743 --> 02:41.287
Now we'll bring to the stage the candidates.

02:41.371 --> 02:44.040
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator John Keeler.

02:52.841 --> 02:55.510
I'm sorry you have to deal with
my ex-husband's lies.

02:55.593 --> 02:59.055
It's all right.
We have the truth on our side.

02:59.138 --> 03:02.016
Ladies and gentlemen,
President David Palmer.

03:19.033 --> 03:23.955
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator Keeler, good evening.

03:24.038 --> 03:28.501
I'm looking forward to discussing
some of the critical issues...

04:06.206 --> 04:10.418
OK... when I tell you to,
you start fighting with me over the gun.

04:10.502 --> 04:13.046
I gotta pull two guards off the main corridor.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.637
OK, come on.

04:24.224 --> 04:26.768
Help! Help! Help!

04:27.435 --> 04:29.020
  Now! 

04:36.569 --> 04:39.781
That's enough! Enough!

04:39.864 --> 04:42.325
Put on his uniform now.

05:01.010 --> 05:03.179
I want a team at every security post.

05:03.263 --> 05:05.849
Jack and Salazar are in east block.

05:05.932 --> 05:09.519
- You partner's not my only problem.
- Warden, today he is.

05:09.602 --> 05:12.605
He and Salazar need to be
contained and kept alive.

05:12.689 --> 05:16.860
Want me to redeploy my men? I need
to know how real this terrorist threat is.

05:23.741 --> 05:28.204
Salazar's brother will spread a virus into
the population unless we release him.

05:28.288 --> 05:32.333
If we don't, the death toll will be
in the hundreds of thousands.

05:35.170 --> 05:40.425
This is Mitchell. Tactical unit five, you are
now under the command of Agent Edmunds.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.218
Thank you.

05:42.302 --> 05:45.096
- Yeah?
- What the hell is going on over there?

05:45.180 --> 05:48.183
- Jack's breaking Salazar out of prison.
- What?

05:48.266 --> 05:52.729
He thinks he'll deliver him to Hector
and stop the virus from being released.

05:52.812 --> 05:55.356
He's gonna get himself and Salazar killed.

05:55.440 --> 05:59.777
I know, I know. I'm trying to protect him.
What about Kyle Singer?

05:59.861 --> 06:03.156
- We're close to locating him.
- As soon as you do, call me.

06:03.239 --> 06:06.451
If Jack knows we got the carrier
of the virus, he'll return Salazar.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.203
Everyone is working on it.

06:08.536 --> 06:11.247
- We'll find him.
- OK.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.550
 Negro? 

06:32.227 --> 06:34.312
I'm sorry, Linda.

06:44.072 --> 06:45.990
Linda...

06:47.992 --> 06:50.203
Am I gonna die?

06:53.039 --> 06:55.124
It depends...

06:57.001 --> 06:59.921
if they find us in time.

07:00.004 --> 07:02.090
What do you mean?

07:03.591 --> 07:06.511
The guy from the government.

07:06.594 --> 07:10.431
He told my dad that I had
a couple more hours before I...

07:11.516 --> 07:13.726
before I become contagious.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.939
Maybe they'll find us by then.

07:18.022 --> 07:20.108
You'll be OK.

07:21.276 --> 07:24.946
Yeah... maybe.

07:51.139 --> 07:54.517
- What are you doing?
- There must be some wires in here.

07:54.601 --> 07:58.146
- What do you need wire for?
- Get you out of this.

08:13.912 --> 08:16.581
Adam, look at this.
Got it from a Caltrans server.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.958
Traffic camera right near the mall.

08:20.210 --> 08:23.505
It's a blue shirt. Isn't that
what Kyle Singer was wearing?

08:23.588 --> 08:27.050
Yeah. There's enough to enhance.
Release it to my screen.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.135
Got it.

08:29.844 --> 08:30.929
- Kim.
- Yes?

08:31.012 --> 08:32.472
I need you a second.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.474
- You got this?
- Yeah.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.308
All right.

08:37.434 --> 08:38.477
Something wrong?

08:38.561 --> 08:40.813
Have you heard what's going on
at the prison?

08:40.897 --> 08:45.151
No. Adam and I have been working
on finding Singer. Why? What is it?

08:45.235 --> 08:47.654
- Your dad's trying to break out Salazar.
- What?

08:47.737 --> 08:52.492
He's acting on his own authority.
He's trying to remove Salazar by force.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.786
What you mean by "force"?

08:54.869 --> 08:57.497
He started a prison riot to cover the escape.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.166
- Why's he doing this?
- We're trying to figure that out.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.294
- When did you last hear from him?
- About a half hour ago.

09:03.378 --> 09:06.589
He asked me to issue a transfer order
for Ramón Salazar,

09:06.673 --> 09:08.633
and he gave me a password.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.759
And you did it?

09:09.843 --> 09:14.889
Yeah, he said Salazar needed
to be moved. This isn't true?

09:14.973 --> 09:17.475
No, Kim, I'm sorry. Your dad lied to you.

09:19.102 --> 09:20.895
Why would he do that?

09:20.979 --> 09:26.109
He knew if he asked anybody else, they
would know he was violating protocol.

09:29.612 --> 09:32.866
- What's gonna happen to him?
- We're gonna try to find him.

09:32.949 --> 09:35.869
The best way out of this
is to find Kyle Singer.

09:35.952 --> 09:40.790
Then your dad will give up Salazar.
So go back to work. Help Adam.

09:40.874 --> 09:43.126
Yeah, sure.

09:44.335 --> 09:45.378
We're clear!

09:46.671 --> 09:49.549
They'll funnel their forces
through one entrance.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.718
There must be another way, Jack.

09:51.801 --> 09:55.513
The prisoners have taken control.
We have to fight our way through.

09:57.140 --> 09:59.058
Get ready.

10:20.455 --> 10:22.874
  Pick him up! Come on! 

10:22.957 --> 10:25.335
Come on, get 'em on their feet!

10:31.549 --> 10:34.427
- Come on, let's go, let's go!
- Move, move!

10:46.773 --> 10:50.193
Hold your fire!
We got hostages, so back off!

10:50.276 --> 10:52.362
Hold your fire!

10:53.321 --> 10:55.823
Come on, man.

10:57.408 --> 10:59.494
Move! Let's go!

11:00.995 --> 11:02.664
Move!

11:04.999 --> 11:06.709
Move it, move it!

11:22.058 --> 11:26.354
... and in order to do this,
our reserves must be kept 

11:26.437 --> 11:29.023
 and our fossil fuels must be conserved. 

11:29.732 --> 11:33.194
- Did you send me that Kalman filter?
- What?

11:33.278 --> 11:37.407
- I need it to clean up that image.
- Shoot, I forgot. It's in my outbox.

11:37.490 --> 11:39.367
How can you forget?
It's all you're working on.

11:39.450 --> 11:43.329
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sending it
to you right now. Done.

11:43.413 --> 11:46.708
We need to find Kyle Singer
before he's contagious.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.251
I'm doing the best I can.

11:48.334 --> 11:51.254
"The best I can" isn't what we do.
It's done or it's not.

11:51.337 --> 11:53.882
So why are you lecturing me?
It's in your system.

12:03.433 --> 12:05.810
- Kaufman.
- Is there a problem?

12:05.894 --> 12:08.855
I need to make sure
things are running smoothly.

12:08.938 --> 12:15.528
I haven't had a chance to brief you, but
Jack's created a situation over at the prison.

12:15.612 --> 12:18.656
- What situation?
- He started a riot to free Salazar.

12:18.740 --> 12:20.950
They're caught up in the middle of it.

12:21.034 --> 12:22.368
Whoa.

12:22.452 --> 12:27.207
He used Kim to create a transfer order
that started it, so cut her a little slack.

12:28.625 --> 12:31.586
Um... yeah, OK, I understand.

12:31.669 --> 12:36.132
We're all under a lot of pressure, so
let's find Kyle Singer before it's too late.

12:36.216 --> 12:38.676
Yeah, OK. Thanks, Michelle.

12:45.934 --> 12:49.187
Kyle, what are you doing?
There's no way out of here!

12:51.397 --> 12:54.067
You don't deserve what happened.

12:54.150 --> 12:56.569
I do.

12:56.653 --> 12:59.948
If I die, the virus is dyin' with me.

13:01.950 --> 13:03.743
 Kyle! 

13:03.826 --> 13:05.787
Kyle!

13:05.870 --> 13:08.039
Put your feet on here!

13:08.873 --> 13:11.042
Kyle!

13:21.594 --> 13:23.304
Kyle, hold on.

13:48.580 --> 13:50.623
Oh, Kyle.

14:04.554 --> 14:06.931
A welcome-home party?

14:08.099 --> 14:11.519
- You shouldn't be doing this.
- What are you talking about?

14:12.395 --> 14:15.190
You've been running things.

14:15.273 --> 14:18.401
Show Ramón you're going to be his partner.

14:19.277 --> 14:21.487
Not his caterer.

14:21.571 --> 14:25.533
Why do you care? You don't want
to be involved in my business.

14:25.617 --> 14:29.537
No, Papi. I care about you.

14:29.621 --> 14:32.874
And I want you to get what you've earned.

14:45.678 --> 14:48.640
- Yes?
- It's me. Riot's still going on. 

14:48.723 --> 14:51.351
- But we know Ramón's alive.
- Yeah.

14:51.434 --> 14:53.478
But Bauer's gotta get him out soon.

14:53.561 --> 14:58.858
CTU's getting close to finding Singer.
If they do, they'll never let Ramón go.

14:58.942 --> 15:01.611
- Then make sure they don't.
- I'm working on it.

15:01.694 --> 15:03.029
Get it done.

15:19.546 --> 15:21.631
That's him. That's Singer.

15:24.384 --> 15:26.469
Is that a gun?

15:31.558 --> 15:34.060
Yeah. Someone's got him.

15:35.436 --> 15:38.356
We won't be able to get
the licence plate from the shot.

15:38.439 --> 15:42.610
I'll get access to the traffic cameras.
See if we can find them again.

15:44.320 --> 15:48.283
Michelle, we found Singer being driven
from the mall 47 minutes ago.

15:48.366 --> 15:51.828
- Are you working up a vehicle ID?
- As soon as we get another visual. 

15:52.620 --> 15:56.249
- This camera's still functional.
- The hostages are on the right.

15:56.332 --> 15:59.669
- Try and pan the camera over.
- They may see the camera move.

15:59.752 --> 16:01.629
We have no choice. Do it.

16:07.343 --> 16:09.429
There they are.

16:11.931 --> 16:14.225
We gotta get in before they kill everyone.

16:18.146 --> 16:20.607
Come on, faster! Faster!

16:21.441 --> 16:25.153
Let's start wasting the guards
unless they let us walk.

16:25.236 --> 16:28.489
First step outside - bam!
Headshot from a sniper.

16:28.573 --> 16:29.741
You don't know that.

16:29.824 --> 16:33.328
I know cos that's what went down in Chino!

16:33.411 --> 16:36.789
They'll let the guards get wasted.
All they care about is keeping us in.

16:36.873 --> 16:39.751
What the hell are we doing here, then?

16:44.464 --> 16:47.634
Give me your gun.
Bring 'em over here.

16:48.384 --> 16:53.681
We're gonna have a little fun with 'em.
Put 'em on their knees.

16:54.849 --> 16:56.935
Who wants to live?

17:14.035 --> 17:16.371
- OK.
- Do 'em all, dude. Do 'em all.

17:16.454 --> 17:17.872
Let's try it again.

17:19.624 --> 17:22.752
- Who wants to live?
- Me! I do.

17:23.586 --> 17:25.755
Him. Over here.

17:31.135 --> 17:33.137
Who else?

17:37.517 --> 17:39.602
I've never seen you before.

17:39.686 --> 17:41.771
I'm new here.

17:43.857 --> 17:45.984
Him, over here.

18:07.463 --> 18:09.674
One in six chance.

18:15.346 --> 18:17.473
You're first.

18:18.308 --> 18:21.352
Please... don't make me do this.

18:21.436 --> 18:24.856
There's nothing to it.
Just put the gun to your head...

18:24.939 --> 18:27.692
I can't. I can't.

18:30.278 --> 18:32.614
You're gonna do it. You hear me?

18:32.697 --> 18:35.033
Please... please...

18:35.116 --> 18:36.826
It's easy. See?

18:38.453 --> 18:40.371
All you gotta do is smile.

18:41.164 --> 18:43.082
And pull the trigger.

18:53.343 --> 18:55.803
Now it's one in five.

19:06.981 --> 19:08.816
Let's go!

19:19.285 --> 19:21.538
No! No!

19:21.621 --> 19:24.499
  I can't. I can't. 

19:27.377 --> 19:31.381
- This is a waste of my time. Shoot him!
- No, wait! Wait!

19:32.799 --> 19:36.678
Come on, man. Just do it.

19:36.761 --> 19:39.722
This way at least you got a chance, OK? Do it.

19:41.516 --> 19:43.601
Come on.

19:45.103 --> 19:48.815
You're gonna do it... or we will.

20:04.455 --> 20:05.832
  Yeah! Yeah! 

20:05.915 --> 20:08.168
We have a winner!

20:09.669 --> 20:12.797
 Let's hear it for the new guy. 

20:24.017 --> 20:27.520
 We're now seeing concrete results. 

20:27.604 --> 20:30.982
 This is a road we will continue to travel. 

20:34.235 --> 20:37.989
I got a shot from a camera
at the next intersection. The same truck.

20:38.072 --> 20:39.741
Can you read the licence plate?

20:39.824 --> 20:44.329
We won't be able to read anything
until it finishes downloading.

20:44.412 --> 20:46.873
I just saw the IAD inquiry
come in over the system

20:46.956 --> 20:49.501
about what your father's doing at the prison.

20:49.584 --> 20:53.087
They're questioning the transfer order
you generated for him.

20:53.171 --> 20:55.381
I heard.

20:55.465 --> 21:01.137
If you want me to say you didn't know
he'd use it to break out Salazar, I will.

21:02.180 --> 21:04.849
Thanks. I'll be OK.

21:06.309 --> 21:10.230
Hold on. It stopped downloading.
I'm getting an error message.

21:11.272 --> 21:16.152
Error 402. That means trouble
with an internal router.

21:42.887 --> 21:45.890
Gael. What are you doing?

21:45.974 --> 21:49.853
There's a problem with one
of the routers. I'm trying to fix it.

21:49.936 --> 21:53.481
- Why don't you call a tech?
- No, it's OK.

21:53.565 --> 21:55.358
I think I found the problem.

21:55.441 --> 21:59.028
Protection circuit kicked in.
Must've been a line surge.

22:00.530 --> 22:02.866
Should be up and running now.

22:03.491 --> 22:07.453
- Let me know if you have more problems.
- I will.

22:16.212 --> 22:18.006
  It's back up. What was it? 

22:18.089 --> 22:21.801
I'm not sure. Is it possible a surge
could've knocked out a router?

22:21.885 --> 22:25.013
Not from my side.
You could ask Chloe.

22:30.310 --> 22:33.104
 Got it. 

22:33.188 --> 22:35.023
 Hold on. 

22:35.106 --> 22:37.275
 I've got a plate on the pickup. 

22:37.358 --> 22:38.484
Where do you have it?

22:38.568 --> 22:42.197
In the north quadrant
of Santa Fe Springs, driving west.

22:42.280 --> 22:46.284
Put this out to mobile units.
I want everyone looking for this vehicle.

22:46.367 --> 22:48.244
 OK, right. 

22:49.454 --> 22:50.747
Ryan, I'm back.

22:50.830 --> 22:55.001
So, do you have any idea if Bauer is
trying to break out Salazar on his own 

22:55.084 --> 22:56.878
 or if he's working with someone? 

22:56.961 --> 23:01.341
- I'll get back to you when I find out.
- You do that. 

23:08.556 --> 23:10.266
- Chloe.
- Yeah, Michelle? 

23:10.350 --> 23:14.229
- Know what's going on at the prison?
- What's happening? 

23:14.312 --> 23:18.775
We don't have the details, but Jack's
behind it. Check his phone logs, email.

23:18.858 --> 23:21.444
 See what case files he's accessed recently. 

23:21.528 --> 23:22.862
What am I looking for?

23:22.946 --> 23:25.323
Anything to help us know
why he's doing this.

23:25.406 --> 23:28.618
Are you sure?
You really want me snooping in his office? 

23:30.328 --> 23:33.122
- Yes.
- You got it.

23:49.389 --> 23:52.600
- Surgery.
- This is Tony Almeida's wife, Michelle. 

23:52.684 --> 23:55.728
- How's he doing?
- I'll check. One moment, please. 

23:58.106 --> 23:59.732
- Mrs Almeida?
- Yeah? 

23:59.816 --> 24:05.363
He's still in surgery. You'll be contacted
as soon as he's rolled into Recovery.

24:05.446 --> 24:09.117
- What room is he in?
- Operating room four. 

24:09.200 --> 24:11.286
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. 

24:16.708 --> 24:18.918
- Network op seven.
- It's Michelle. 

24:19.002 --> 24:21.588
Do we get OR feeds from Good Samaritan?

24:21.671 --> 24:23.756
 Let me check. 

24:25.633 --> 24:27.635
 Yeah, they do. What do you need? 

24:27.719 --> 24:32.223
- See if they're video-docking OR four.
- Yeah, they are. Where do you want it? 

24:32.307 --> 24:35.935
- Send it to my desktop.
- All right. It'll take a second. 

24:38.563 --> 24:40.940
- There you go. Anything else?
- No. 

24:41.024 --> 24:42.525
 Sure. 

25:04.047 --> 25:06.299
- Four by four.
- More pressure.

25:06.382 --> 25:08.801
- Can you hold that down?
- I've got it.

25:14.140 --> 25:16.351
Got another clamp?

25:16.434 --> 25:18.186
Clamp.

25:42.252 --> 25:46.339
I'll ID the location for the explosives
once we get to the laundry room.

25:46.422 --> 25:48.508
Your weapon, sir.

25:58.309 --> 26:00.854
Sir, we're ready for you.

26:04.691 --> 26:10.446
It's on. Monitor's up.
Should be seeing it on your eyepiece.

26:10.947 --> 26:12.657
- It's working.
- OK.

26:17.871 --> 26:21.791
Radio silence while we're in.
If they hear us, they might kill everyone.

26:23.501 --> 26:25.378
Let's go.

26:33.386 --> 26:36.431
All right! Round two!

26:36.514 --> 26:39.184
  Yeah! 

26:42.270 --> 26:46.274
- And you.
- I'm a prisoner, not a guard!

26:46.357 --> 26:48.943
Ramón Salazar.
I'm sure you've heard of me.

26:49.027 --> 26:51.946
Pick someone else.
He's telling the truth.

26:52.030 --> 26:55.950
He transferred to this block less than
a week ago. I'm a federal agent.

26:56.034 --> 27:00.538
I was escorting him out of the prison.
That's why you've never seen us before.

27:01.372 --> 27:04.959
Good. Federal agent.

27:09.631 --> 27:13.218
- What's your name?
- Jack Bauer.

27:15.053 --> 27:18.097
All right! It's gonna be Agent Jack...

27:19.432 --> 27:22.143
against Ramón Salazar!

27:22.227 --> 27:26.231
- A battle to the finish!
-  Yeah! 

27:46.000 --> 27:50.672
Come on, Jack.
Show this foreigner how it's done.

28:26.374 --> 28:28.543
If I die, my brother will find you.

28:28.626 --> 28:30.837
Shut up and do it.

28:30.920 --> 28:34.174
  Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! 

28:34.257 --> 28:36.467
Do it! Do it! Do it!

28:42.056 --> 28:44.976
  Die! Die! Die! Die! 

28:56.738 --> 28:59.073
All right, you're up.

29:09.584 --> 29:12.837
Looks like you might lose the title, Jack.

29:14.506 --> 29:16.591
  Do it! Do it! Do it! 

29:35.360 --> 29:36.903
Ramón, stay down!

29:48.665 --> 29:50.375
Ramón, come on.

30:03.638 --> 30:05.723
All clear. Hold your fire.

30:08.309 --> 30:10.186
Jack!

30:12.730 --> 30:13.898
Jack!

30:21.030 --> 30:25.159
 Senator Keeler would have
you believe that I have no triumphs 

30:25.243 --> 30:27.996
 and only defeats. 

30:59.569 --> 31:01.779
God.

31:14.751 --> 31:16.461
- Lab.
- This is Chloe O'Brian. 

31:16.544 --> 31:20.548
I'm in Jack's office. Could you send
someone up with a drug kit, please?

31:20.632 --> 31:22.675
 On his way. 

31:25.011 --> 31:28.139
The differences on the issues are clear.

31:28.223 --> 31:33.478
But I believe you don't elect a platform;
you elect the man.

31:33.561 --> 31:36.231
I am troubled by some
of the personal choices

31:36.314 --> 31:39.609
that this president has made
and continues to make. 

31:39.692 --> 31:45.114
We're all aware of the allegations and
indictments surrounding his former wife. 

31:45.198 --> 31:48.701
Most of us have operated
under the assumption

31:48.785 --> 31:50.954
that he would not repeat his history

31:51.037 --> 31:54.958
of associating with persons
of questionable moral character. 

31:55.041 --> 31:58.753
 However, my office has just learned 

31:58.837 --> 32:04.467
that the woman with whom the president
is currently involved, Dr Anne Packard, 

32:04.551 --> 32:09.722
is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial, 

32:09.806 --> 32:13.268
a drug which later led to the deaths
of three innocent people.

32:13.351 --> 32:18.982
This is outrageous. This debate is not
a court of law, nor is it a tabloid paper.

32:19.065 --> 32:23.611
This is neither the time nor the place
to personally attack a private citizen.

32:23.695 --> 32:28.616
Mr President, the senator still has
30 more seconds, sir. Please.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.243
This is the right time.

32:30.326 --> 32:33.872
I believe the choices your leaders make
in their own lives

32:33.955 --> 32:37.375
reflect the choices that
they will make on your behalf.

32:37.458 --> 32:39.627
And so the question remains:

32:39.711 --> 32:44.174
Did the president know of these accusations
and choose to ignore them?

32:44.257 --> 32:48.052
Or is he repeating past mistakes once again?

32:49.345 --> 32:51.681
Mr President, your rebuttal.

32:52.932 --> 33:00.523
I can tell you with complete confidence
that the senator's accusation is false

33:00.607 --> 33:06.112
and that I believe it is the senator's way
of avoiding the issues at hand.

33:06.196 --> 33:09.949
I came here to discuss
the real issues pressing our country. 

33:10.033 --> 33:11.284
Oh, God.

33:11.367 --> 33:14.037
- I assume that the senator...
- Now do you get it? 

33:14.120 --> 33:18.917
 This is not something to be
swept under the rug and forgotten. 

33:35.683 --> 33:37.769
It's positive.

33:40.855 --> 33:43.233
I'll go tell Michelle.

33:59.832 --> 34:02.293
What are you doing in my dad's office?

34:02.377 --> 34:04.838
Michelle wanted me to go through his stuff.

34:04.921 --> 34:06.297
Why?

34:06.381 --> 34:09.884
To find anything that could help us
understand what he's doing.

34:09.967 --> 34:14.681
Can a line surge shut down a router
on your side of the ITS room?

34:14.764 --> 34:18.685
No, my circuit protectors are upstairs,
not in ITS. Why?

34:18.768 --> 34:21.688
It's probably nothing. Hm.

34:25.315 --> 34:28.319
- Did you find anything?
- I can't talk about this.

34:29.195 --> 34:32.614
- Why not? Maybe I can help.
- You can't help, so just go, OK?

34:35.284 --> 34:37.745
- What's in the box?
- Stuff I'm taking to Michelle.

34:37.829 --> 34:41.123
This is really inappropriate behavior, Kim.

34:41.206 --> 34:44.710
Why are you doing this?
I'm just trying to help you.

34:44.793 --> 34:47.589
I don't have to have this conversation.

34:47.672 --> 34:53.136
Field Op mandate regulation 40 or 41
says that I have jurisdictional prerogative.

34:53.219 --> 34:59.017
- So could you just leave?
- Not until you tell me what's in the box.

35:00.435 --> 35:02.687
I think your dad's been using drugs.

35:02.770 --> 35:05.273
- What?
- That's right.

35:07.483 --> 35:11.654
Rubber tourniquet... syringe.

35:11.738 --> 35:15.491
We just had the vials tested for opiates.
It was positive.

35:15.575 --> 35:17.911
And he's been acting really weird. OK?

35:29.130 --> 35:34.636
It's really not fair that you made me do this.
This is very uncomfortable.

35:44.479 --> 35:51.778
Michelle, I found nothing in Jack's records,
but there's something you need to see.

36:03.748 --> 36:07.210
- This was in his office?
- I wanted to make sure what it was first.

36:07.293 --> 36:11.297
The liquid in these vials tested positive
for opiates. Probably heroin.

36:11.381 --> 36:13.466
I think Jack's a user.

36:17.846 --> 36:20.598
A patrol car found the truck
Kyle Singer was in,

36:20.682 --> 36:24.227
parked in an industrial complex
at Fuller and 4th, 2000 block.

36:24.310 --> 36:26.354
Pipe this into the teams on stand-by.

36:26.437 --> 36:30.733
Assume everyone on site is contagious
and use level-one CDC protocol.

36:30.817 --> 36:32.402
Let's get him!

36:53.047 --> 36:57.260
- Damn! Is there any other way out?
- No, we're pinned in.

36:57.343 --> 37:01.347
You must have known this could happen.
What's the plan, Jack?

37:05.810 --> 37:08.563
Give me the shotgun.

37:09.522 --> 37:10.857
Give me the shotgun.

37:18.406 --> 37:20.491
Take off your uniform.

37:32.045 --> 37:34.923
  I have worked with my administration 

37:35.006 --> 37:38.968
on my overall economic plan.
The projections could not look better. 

37:41.387 --> 37:42.430
Dessler.

37:42.514 --> 37:47.268
We're approaching the complex.
There are three warehouses on the property. 

37:47.352 --> 37:50.063
I'll see if we can narrow it down with infrared.

37:53.316 --> 37:55.693
 Kaufman. 

37:56.402 --> 37:59.864
Adam, pull up infrared satellite
on the industrial complex.

37:59.948 --> 38:01.658
On it.

38:01.741 --> 38:03.993
Kim, log onto the NRT server.

38:04.077 --> 38:07.121
We need to see if they have
any satellites in position.

38:11.751 --> 38:13.962
- Kim.
- OK.

38:16.589 --> 38:19.300
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

38:36.734 --> 38:38.945
Jack or Salazar aren't in the east block.

38:39.028 --> 38:43.533
My team can't do a search until we
lock down. That could take a half hour.

38:45.910 --> 38:50.915
You wanna get out of this? You have to
trust me and do everything that I tell you.

38:50.999 --> 38:54.586
- You understand?
- All right.

38:54.669 --> 38:55.712
Come on, let's go.

38:55.795 --> 38:58.923
I want you to take that chopper
and sweep the perimeter.

38:59.007 --> 39:01.134
  Chase! 

39:04.053 --> 39:06.347
- What are you doing?
- Move these people back

39:06.431 --> 39:09.309
or you'll have to take me out!
We need that chopper!

39:09.392 --> 39:13.605
Don't do this. I spoke with Michelle.
We're close to getting Kyle Singer.

39:13.688 --> 39:18.026
"Close" ain't gonna cut it this time!
I gotta deliver Salazar now!

39:18.109 --> 39:19.944
I'm not letting you go, Jack!

39:20.028 --> 39:23.114
How long is it gonna take you
to find Kyle Singer?

39:23.198 --> 39:25.325
A half an hour? An hour?

39:25.408 --> 39:31.414
I gotta get Salazar in that chopper in the next
60 seconds or 100,000 people will die!

39:50.642 --> 39:52.018
- Let him go.
- Let him go?

39:52.101 --> 39:56.606
Let him go. Track the chopper. I need
you to keep your people under control.

39:56.689 --> 40:01.069
Please. I can't have anything
happen to Salazar.

40:05.740 --> 40:08.076
All right.

40:08.159 --> 40:12.205
This is Warden Mitchell.
I want all teams to stand down.

40:12.288 --> 40:15.041
Agent Bauer will take Salazar
to the SWAT chopper.

40:15.124 --> 40:18.169
All teams confirm the stand-down order.

40:18.253 --> 40:20.463
Let him take the chopper.

40:20.547 --> 40:22.632
Stand down.

40:23.967 --> 40:25.802
All right? Back off.

40:27.428 --> 40:30.265
All right, Jack.
No one will try and stop you.

40:30.348 --> 40:32.767
Get this men to holster their weapons!

40:32.851 --> 40:36.896
Back off! Stand down! Back off!

40:36.980 --> 40:38.606
Let's move.

40:40.483 --> 40:43.736
- Get them to holster their weapons!
- Holster your weapon!

40:43.820 --> 40:45.947
- Lower your weapon!
- Stand down!

40:46.030 --> 40:48.741
Get the snipers down off the roof!
Now! Now!

40:48.825 --> 40:51.619
Get off the roof! Get off the roof!

40:51.703 --> 40:54.539
Back off! Do what he says!

41:27.864 --> 41:31.534
We have Singer plus one.
Central, we have Singer plus one.

41:44.797 --> 41:48.718
- What's he doin'?
- Disabled the com and the locator.

41:54.098 --> 41:55.141
Yeah?

41:55.225 --> 41:57.268
It's Michelle. We have Kyle Singer.

41:57.352 --> 42:00.813
