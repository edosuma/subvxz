Hello, welcome
to Can You Hear Me?

00:49.189 --> 00:52.324
Your source for all things
Tucker Crowe.

00:52.326 --> 00:56.095
If you're here, you're probably
already a fan of Tucker's music,

00:56.097 --> 00:59.364
but if you're merely
Crowe-curious

00:59.366 --> 01:02.367
or you clicked on the link
by accident,

01:02.369 --> 01:05.504
allow me introduce you
to one of the most seminal

01:05.506 --> 01:09.510
and yet unsung figures
of alternative rock.

01:11.712 --> 01:15.047
<i>♪ Pick you up
Just tell me when you land ♪</i>

01:15.049 --> 01:18.784
Although Tucker started
writing songs in his early teens,

01:18.786 --> 01:20.419
his real breakthrough
was the release

01:20.421 --> 01:23.354
of the 1993 album <i>Juliet.</i>

01:23.356 --> 01:25.490
It earned respectable
college radio play,

01:25.492 --> 01:28.260
but was vastly underappreciated
by the mainstream.

01:28.262 --> 01:32.196
On the list of Top Heartbreak
Albums on RollingStone.com

01:32.198 --> 01:34.400
it comes only 43rd,

01:34.402 --> 01:37.803
which is a joke.

01:37.805 --> 01:41.773
<i>Juliet,</i> quite simply,
is a masterpiece.

01:41.775 --> 01:44.743
Tucker wrote it after
a whirlwind love affair

01:44.745 --> 01:46.612
with Julie Beatty,

01:46.614 --> 01:50.148
a model and fixture
of the Los Angeles demimonde.

01:50.150 --> 01:52.284
The termination
of their brief tryst

01:52.286 --> 01:56.555
simultaneously inspired him
and crushed his soul.

01:56.557 --> 02:00.192
In June of that same year,
1993,

02:00.194 --> 02:02.193
Tucker played an engagement
at the Pit Club

02:02.195 --> 02:04.595
in Minneapolis,
United States,

02:04.597 --> 02:07.166
that would prove
to be his final show.

02:07.168 --> 02:10.768
Last seen exiting the men's
toilets after his first set,

02:10.770 --> 02:14.440
Tucker abruptly canceled
all future shows,

02:14.442 --> 02:17.145
and has never performed
publicly again.

02:18.412 --> 02:21.280
This snapshot,
taken in 2014,

02:21.282 --> 02:25.483
is purported to be of Tucker on
his sheep farm in Pennsylvania,

02:25.485 --> 02:29.687
although there is quite a lot of
debate as to its authenticity.

02:29.689 --> 02:32.323
The true whereabouts
and creative endeavors

02:32.325 --> 02:36.195
of Mr. Crowe
remain a mystery.

03:30.850 --> 03:32.750
<i>Best years of my life.</i>

03:32.752 --> 03:34.852
<i>But I came back
when my dad got ill.</i>

03:34.854 --> 03:36.588
<i>He ran the local
history museum</i>

03:36.590 --> 03:39.323
<i>until he couldn't remember
his own name.</i>

03:41.861 --> 03:43.561
<i>I've been running it
ever since</i>

03:43.563 --> 03:45.564
<i>in a supposedly
temporary capacity.</i>

03:45.566 --> 03:49.434
- Hey, Annie.
- Morning. Hi.

03:49.436 --> 03:51.703
Annie, sorry to bother you.
Is Ross still not in?

03:51.705 --> 03:53.538
No, but I'll take care of it.

03:53.540 --> 03:55.543
Thanks, Katie.

03:56.911 --> 03:58.776
<i>As my sister, Ros,
can attest...</i>

03:58.778 --> 04:00.645
- Hey.
- You all right?

04:00.647 --> 04:02.915
<i>Finding a likeminded partner
can be a challenge.</i>

04:02.917 --> 04:04.917
- What?
- Nothing.

04:04.919 --> 04:07.653
- She's hot. Got a tight body.
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:07.655 --> 04:09.620
<i>So, when this bloke moves
to town 15 years ago</i>

04:09.622 --> 04:11.389
<i>to guest lecture a course</i>

04:11.391 --> 04:13.691
<i>on the American cinema
and the alienated male,</i>

04:13.693 --> 04:15.827
<i>well, it was pretty cool.</i>

04:15.829 --> 04:19.298
<i>I fell in love quickly.</i>

04:19.300 --> 04:23.368
<i>Back then we'd jabber on about
movies and books and music.</i>

04:23.370 --> 04:25.204
<i>He would actually listen.</i>

04:25.206 --> 04:27.238
- Yeah...
- Never get that gate.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.541
<i>Well, sometimes.</i>

04:29.543 --> 04:32.911
<i>Now, his own obsessions
dominate my life.</i>

04:32.913 --> 04:34.613
<i>And it's become clear
that all along,</i>

04:34.615 --> 04:36.414
<i>he's been in love
with another man.</i>

04:38.485 --> 04:40.651
<i>Not like that, but
in an equally consuming</i>

04:40.653 --> 04:42.921
<i>and, quite frankly,
really bothersome way.</i>

04:42.923 --> 04:45.623
No, no, no. Didn't I send you
an article on this just last week?

04:45.625 --> 04:47.459
<i>He is the ringleader
of a community</i>

04:47.461 --> 04:49.293
<i>of 200 middle-aged men</i>

04:49.295 --> 04:51.863
<i>who gather together
to obsessively deconstruct</i>

04:51.865 --> 04:55.267
<i>their hero's music and attempt
to crack his mysteries.</i>

04:55.269 --> 04:56.702
That's a really
interesting theory...

04:56.704 --> 04:58.236
<i>That's what I said.</i>

04:58.238 --> 05:00.741
...that I've heard
a thousand times.

05:06.247 --> 05:07.445
Annie. Annie.

05:07.447 --> 05:08.913
- This is Carly.
- Hi.

05:08.915 --> 05:10.649
- Lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you, too.

05:10.651 --> 05:12.384
- Isn't she amazing?
- Yes.

05:12.386 --> 05:14.019
- She's older than she looks.
- Welcome. Come in.

05:14.021 --> 05:15.820
- Thank you.
- She's fit.

05:15.822 --> 05:17.356
How'd you guys meet?

05:17.358 --> 05:18.856
It's funny, actually.

05:18.858 --> 05:20.558
Because I was just
walking down the street,

05:20.560 --> 05:22.426
and then I just saw her face,
basically,

05:22.428 --> 05:24.396
and I was just like wow,
I have to speak to that girl.

05:24.398 --> 05:27.365
Then she was being funny about
giving me her phone number,

05:27.367 --> 05:28.834
but I stole her phone,
put my number in

05:28.836 --> 05:30.334
and we've just been texting.

05:30.336 --> 05:31.836
Yeah, it just went from there,
I guess.

05:31.838 --> 05:34.339
- Cake's delicious, by the way.
- Thank you.

05:34.341 --> 05:36.041
I still can't believe
these are edible.

05:36.043 --> 05:37.575
Oh, yeah. Marzipan.

05:37.577 --> 05:40.411
My boyfriend, he's a baker.

05:40.413 --> 05:42.748
- Ex-boyfriend.
- My ex. Sorry, my ex.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.716
Yeah, he's not going
to believe this.

05:44.718 --> 05:46.685
So, do you guys have kids?

05:46.687 --> 05:48.687
Oh, no, they're against
Duncan's religion.

05:48.689 --> 05:51.289
- Ros, she's joking.
- She's not, actually.

05:51.291 --> 05:53.992
Annie and I decided a long,
long time ago,

05:53.994 --> 05:55.726
that babies weren't our jam.

05:55.728 --> 05:57.562
- Oh!
- Sorry, I was just...

05:57.564 --> 06:00.464
The important thing is,
we're happy where we are.

06:00.466 --> 06:04.002
I mean, who wants to bring kids
into this bloody world?

06:04.004 --> 06:05.671
- Fuck kids.
- You know?

06:05.673 --> 06:08.774
Right?

06:08.776 --> 06:10.942
- Fuck them.
- Every aspect of civilization

06:10.944 --> 06:12.411
has gone to the dogs,

06:12.413 --> 06:14.512
with the notable exception
of TV.

06:14.514 --> 06:16.014
TV is good.

06:16.016 --> 06:17.882
Yeah. People watch it,
don't they.

06:17.884 --> 06:19.685
I guess my point is,
I just don't think

06:19.687 --> 06:20.918
that the world needs more kids.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.688
- I think we get it.
- Yeah.

06:23.690 --> 06:26.358
Ros says you're into
some really old rock musician.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.459
What's his name again?
Tucker Crowey?

06:28.461 --> 06:30.394
Tucker Crowe, actually.

06:30.396 --> 06:32.096
Never heard of him.
What's he about?

06:32.098 --> 06:34.632
Where do I start?

06:34.634 --> 06:35.933
You're going to be here hours.

06:35.935 --> 06:37.735
Let me play you some stuff.

06:37.737 --> 06:39.603

07:08.067 --> 07:09.870

- Yeah.

07:12.773 --> 07:16.041

07:46.173 --> 07:48.673
- Yeah.
- Someone saved the eye.

07:48.675 --> 07:49.908
Why?

07:49.910 --> 07:52.176
Oh! Look at that.

07:52.178 --> 07:53.678
Oh, it's really intriguing.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.014
Mm, it is, isn't it.

07:57.016 --> 07:58.949
Is this all you
have for the exhibition?

07:58.951 --> 08:00.452
Just some sad,
old snapshots?

08:00.454 --> 08:01.752
Look at how they're posed.

08:01.754 --> 08:03.788
I wonder what happened
to them.

08:03.790 --> 08:05.089
I think it's really poignant.

08:05.091 --> 08:06.625
A very poignant moment.

08:06.627 --> 08:08.026
I wonder if they did the murder

08:08.028 --> 08:09.760
before or after
they went to the beach.

08:09.762 --> 08:11.665
Ros, shut up.

08:13.867 --> 08:15.132
<i>These are the pawns.</i>

08:15.134 --> 08:17.435
<i>They're like the soldiers.</i>

08:17.437 --> 08:20.171
<i>They move like this.
One space forward only.</i>

08:20.173 --> 08:22.440
<i>So how do you get
to be the king?</i>

08:22.442 --> 08:24.074
How, indeed.

08:24.076 --> 08:27.913
Even David Simon himself
resisted the label "Dickensian".

08:27.915 --> 08:30.014
Sure, there are detailed
depictions

08:30.016 --> 08:31.615
of every strata of society,

08:31.617 --> 08:35.020
but no kindly uncle
is going to drop by

08:35.022 --> 08:37.722
to let them know
that Wallace has fallen

08:37.724 --> 08:39.957
into an unforeseen fortune.

08:41.628 --> 08:43.494
The good are not rewarded
on the streets.

08:43.496 --> 08:47.632
Moral clarity exists not.

08:47.634 --> 08:48.934
As we jump into season two,

08:48.936 --> 08:50.669
I've created
a glossary of terms,

08:50.671 --> 08:53.204
because some of you have
complained, nay, whinged,

08:53.206 --> 08:55.540
about the complexity
of the lexicon.

08:55.542 --> 08:57.809
Hopefully,
this should help you out.

08:57.811 --> 08:59.643
"Five-O".

08:59.645 --> 09:01.879
The police, or polis.

09:01.881 --> 09:03.482
"Shorty".

09:03.484 --> 09:06.184
Attractive female,
or alternately,

09:06.186 --> 09:08.656
a half-pint of liquor.

09:09.789 --> 09:11.256
Hi. Sorry, excuse me.

09:11.258 --> 09:13.023
I just wanted to ask you
a couple of questions

09:13.025 --> 09:15.826
about that whole
"Greek tragedy paradigm" thing.

09:15.828 --> 09:18.262
Oh, you know, my office hours
are actually on a Monday.

09:18.264 --> 09:20.898
- We can discuss it then, maybe.
- Oh, right. Yes. Sorry.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.868
I'm not actually
a student.

09:22.870 --> 09:24.869
I...

09:24.871 --> 09:26.504
I just started teaching.

09:26.506 --> 09:28.739
So I've been sitting in
on different classes,

09:28.741 --> 09:31.609
trying to see how
the professionals do it.

09:31.611 --> 09:33.011
- Oh, well, welcome.
- Thank you.

09:33.013 --> 09:34.579
- Gina.
- Duncan.

09:34.581 --> 09:35.881
Hi.

09:35.883 --> 09:37.815
So, that Greek tragedy thing...?

09:37.817 --> 09:39.251
Right. Yeah...

09:39.253 --> 09:41.786
I guess my point
was that these characters,

09:41.788 --> 09:44.922
they're already bound
to their fate.

09:44.924 --> 09:46.657
- Like Antigone.
- Wow.

09:46.659 --> 09:48.225
Or Medea.

09:48.227 --> 09:50.027
So I have to read Antigone
to understand <i>The Wire?</i>

09:50.029 --> 09:54.534
Not strictly speaking,
but it wouldn't hurt.

10:20.126 --> 10:22.093
"Thought you'd want
to hear this.

10:22.095 --> 10:24.296
Original demo recording
from a certain album

10:24.298 --> 10:27.668

10:28.701 --> 10:31.072
Shit.

11:28.928 --> 11:30.395
Body, Drama and Catharsis.

11:30.397 --> 11:33.230
It's essentially healing
through movement.

11:33.232 --> 11:35.099
- Dance therapy.
- No, not dance.

11:35.101 --> 11:36.734
- Oh?
- Movement.

11:36.736 --> 11:38.670
Oh, completely different.

11:38.672 --> 11:40.004
Completely different.

11:40.006 --> 11:41.138
I don't know
what I was thinking.

11:41.140 --> 11:42.806
No, I love dance.

11:42.808 --> 11:44.309
I'm a dancer,
and I'm still a dancer.

11:44.311 --> 11:46.645
But... okay, I'm going to sound
like a wanker,

11:46.647 --> 11:48.713
but I'm going
to say it anyway.

11:48.715 --> 11:50.882
I believe in the power of art.

11:50.884 --> 11:55.119
I believe that creativity
can change people's lives.

11:55.121 --> 11:56.954
That's fucking refreshing.

11:56.956 --> 12:00.291
I just... I hope you haven't
come to the wrong place.

12:00.293 --> 12:01.959
- Why?
- The next Bob Dylan

12:01.961 --> 12:03.895
could be playing up there,

12:03.897 --> 12:06.397
these people wouldn't look up
from their fucking sudoku.

12:06.399 --> 12:09.300
<i>♪ Look up, look
up Look up to the sky ♪</i>

12:11.804 --> 12:14.406
<i>♪ To the light ♪</i>

12:16.275 --> 12:17.877
Shit.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.350
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

12:26.352 --> 12:27.786
I had a faculty meeting.

12:29.056 --> 12:31.156
- Oh, I see you've cooked.
- Yeah.

12:31.158 --> 12:34.059
Yeah, I was just reheating
the ziti from last night.

12:34.061 --> 12:37.161
Or I was trying to, I know.
That was terrible, that pan.

12:37.163 --> 12:38.963
Why aren't you wearing
any clothes?

12:38.965 --> 12:40.464
It was so weird.
I bought this dress online,

12:40.466 --> 12:42.867
and then this went off,
so I came down here.

12:42.869 --> 12:44.802
But...

12:44.804 --> 12:46.906
You're acting
very strangely.

12:48.274 --> 12:49.907
- Am I?
- Yeah.

12:49.909 --> 12:52.109
- Have you got a man up there?
- Oh, I wish.

12:52.111 --> 12:54.212
- What are you listening to?
- Huh?

12:54.214 --> 12:57.081
- No, no, hold on, don't tell me.
- I think it's...

12:57.083 --> 12:59.316
Is that the Radio Tokyo tapes?

12:59.318 --> 13:01.252
Yeah?

13:01.254 --> 13:03.454
Did he play "Twentieth Call
of the Day" on the recording?

13:03.456 --> 13:04.988
I don't know if he...

13:04.990 --> 13:06.491
- No, don't stop it.
- What? I don't...

13:06.493 --> 13:08.193
No, don't turn it down.
Let me guess.

13:08.195 --> 13:09.493
No, no, no, let me explain,

13:09.495 --> 13:11.028
because I don't want you
to get upset.

13:11.030 --> 13:14.031
Sorry, just shut up.
I want to guess.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.733
It's nothing.

13:15.735 --> 13:17.801
I mean, obviously it's
"Twentieth Call of the Day",

13:17.803 --> 13:19.103
but from what?

13:19.105 --> 13:21.004
I can't place it.

13:21.006 --> 13:24.074
Hmm. Okay, okay, I give up.
What is it?

13:24.076 --> 13:28.146
It's called <i>Juliet, Naked.</i>

13:28.148 --> 13:30.848
There's no album
called <i>Juliet, Naked.</i>

13:30.850 --> 13:34.786
I guess someone unearthed
the demos from <i>Juliet,</i>

13:34.788 --> 13:38.859
and then they sent it to you
in a package with a note.

13:40.092 --> 13:42.392
This is from Lucas
at the label.

13:42.394 --> 13:46.030
It's addressed to me,
but you've opened it.

13:46.032 --> 13:47.531
I always open your post,

13:47.533 --> 13:49.300
otherwise it sits there for
weeks unopened.

13:49.302 --> 13:50.969
And then you went
and listened to it!

13:50.971 --> 13:52.903
- I'm sorry.
- You listened to it before me?

13:52.905 --> 13:55.239
- I apologize. I just...
- You played it?

13:55.241 --> 13:57.441
- Oh, Annie, you...
- Oh, Duncan!

13:57.443 --> 14:00.411
That... I need to listen to this
on my own.

14:00.413 --> 14:02.379
- It stinks of betrayal in here.
- I'm very sorry.

14:02.381 --> 14:05.318
I didn't mean to upset you.

14:09.155 --> 14:10.790
Ah...

14:23.370 --> 14:28.075
You fucker. You fucker.

14:30.210 --> 14:31.946
Bastards.

14:35.014 --> 14:36.881
Who uses D batteries?

14:36.883 --> 14:39.117
Why do we never
have any batteries?

14:39.119 --> 14:41.451
I buy batteries.
Bloody millions of them!

14:41.453 --> 14:43.021
But you use them,

14:43.023 --> 14:44.855
and God forbid you replace
the batteries!

14:44.857 --> 14:46.523
Stop saying batteries!

14:46.525 --> 14:48.392
Oh, my God,
I've got batteries.

14:48.394 --> 14:51.094
Jesus.

14:51.096 --> 14:52.866

Hello.

15:45.384 --> 15:47.252
I'm sorry.

15:47.254 --> 15:48.619
I was so petty.

15:48.621 --> 15:50.454
So stupid.

15:50.456 --> 15:54.392
What does it matter
who hears it first?

15:54.394 --> 15:57.395
I'm really sorry, too.

15:57.397 --> 15:59.363
I... I feel terrible.

15:59.365 --> 16:03.368
I should have warned you
that it was so dreary.

16:03.370 --> 16:04.602
I didn't say anything.

16:04.604 --> 16:06.671
- Dreary?
- Yeah.

16:06.673 --> 16:08.305
I mean, I suppose
it's interesting

16:08.307 --> 16:11.077
if you've heard the finished
version, but...

16:13.413 --> 16:15.012
What did you think?

16:15.014 --> 16:17.315
- What did I think?
- Yeah.

16:17.317 --> 16:20.951
I think it's a bloody
masterpiece, Annie.

16:20.953 --> 16:22.520
- Dreary?
- You can't be serious.

16:22.522 --> 16:25.690
Oh, what else is dreary
according to you?

16:25.692 --> 16:28.191
<i>The Sopranos? Hamlet?</i>

16:28.193 --> 16:31.130
Jeez Louise.

16:35.936 --> 16:38.036
This is history, Annie.
I'm going to write it.

16:38.038 --> 16:41.004
It is not history,
it's boring versions of songs

16:41.006 --> 16:43.074
that you've heard
a million times before.

16:43.076 --> 16:44.574
Oh, my God,
you think that's what this is?

16:44.576 --> 16:47.545
This is big for me,
that this has happened.

16:47.547 --> 16:49.546
And I just don't want
to spend my time

16:49.548 --> 16:51.416
in the aftermath
of this new information

16:51.418 --> 16:53.618
with someone
who doesn't get it.

16:53.620 --> 16:56.222
I want to spend it
with people who do.

17:11.037 --> 17:12.269
Morning.

17:12.271 --> 17:14.008
Hey.

17:15.674 --> 17:19.443
Things are pretty wild
on the forum this morning.

17:19.444 --> 17:21.011
157 comments.

17:21.012 --> 17:22.949
Do you want tea?

17:24.150 --> 17:25.650
Hmm? Did you say something?

17:25.652 --> 17:29.353
The response to my review
has been incredible.

17:29.355 --> 17:31.389
If I don't send the guys
some files soon,

17:31.391 --> 17:33.725
they're going to murder me.

17:33.727 --> 17:36.997
Oh, 158.

17:38.030 --> 17:39.430
Oh, somebody new.

17:39.432 --> 17:40.631
This is a long one.

17:40.633 --> 17:43.167
"Relic Master" they go by.

17:43.169 --> 17:46.674
They claim to have
already heard the album.

17:47.773 --> 17:49.207
I doubt that.

17:49.209 --> 17:50.540
Let's see what they...

17:50.542 --> 17:52.642
<i>"Juliet, Naked</i>
is naked all right.

17:52.644 --> 17:55.446
A naked attempt to squeeze
a few more quid

17:55.448 --> 17:57.248
out of a long-dead career."

17:57.250 --> 18:00.284
Sounds like you and he
would get along swimmingly.

18:00.286 --> 18:01.719
She.

18:01.721 --> 18:03.688
No, I seriously doubt
it's a woman.

18:03.690 --> 18:05.456
We don't get a lot
of lady visitors.

18:05.458 --> 18:08.062
Well, it is.

18:13.165 --> 18:14.600
Okay.

18:16.336 --> 18:18.302
I see.

18:18.304 --> 18:20.337
What are you going to do?
Are you going to ban me?

18:20.339 --> 18:22.305
Or block me because I disagree
with you?

18:22.307 --> 18:23.740
That's against site rules.

18:23.742 --> 18:28.446
Everybody's entitled
to their opinion.

18:28.448 --> 18:30.384
However wrong you are.

18:33.486 --> 18:35.553
As long as you're civil
you can write any old shit.

18:35.555 --> 18:37.654
Oh, thank you so much.

18:37.656 --> 18:39.257
Oh, Annie.

18:39.259 --> 18:41.058
What?

18:41.060 --> 18:43.193
You just told me that I was
entitled to my opinion.

18:43.195 --> 18:45.763
But, "listless", "enervated"?

18:45.765 --> 18:47.498
"Flaccid"?

18:47.500 --> 18:49.499
I'm going to out a bullet
in my fucking mouth

18:49.501 --> 18:52.236
if I have to talk about
Tucker Crowe any more today.

18:52.238 --> 18:53.571
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

18:53.573 --> 18:55.338
How could these sketches
for songs

18:55.340 --> 18:57.240
be considered better than
the finished product, right?

18:57.242 --> 18:58.642
Exactly.

18:58.644 --> 19:00.244
How could leaving something
half-formed

19:00.246 --> 19:02.080
be better than
if you worked on it

19:02.082 --> 19:03.680
until it was the completed thing
that it was meant to be?

19:03.682 --> 19:05.315
Agreed.

19:05.317 --> 19:07.117
Eighteen other people
agree with me, too.

19:07.119 --> 19:09.286
Look, look, see.

19:09.288 --> 19:11.354
"Well said, @RelicMaster."

19:11.356 --> 19:13.123
- Wow, look at that.
- Right? Right?

19:13.125 --> 19:14.491
Because I made the point
very clearly,

19:14.493 --> 19:16.427
and without any bullying
or any smugness.

19:16.429 --> 19:19.066
Shit. The mayor's here.

19:20.467 --> 19:21.766
I don't get it.

19:21.768 --> 19:23.734
This is not
what we talked about.

19:23.736 --> 19:26.136
Well, my thinking was that we'd
tell the story of the summer

19:26.138 --> 19:27.671
through normal people.

19:27.673 --> 19:29.407
So, I mean, for instance,
look at this image.

19:29.409 --> 19:30.574
Like, the emotional narrative...

19:30.576 --> 19:31.843
You think people
want to pay money

19:31.845 --> 19:33.510
to see other people's
snapshots?

19:33.512 --> 19:35.113
- No...
- Jesus Christ, let her finish.

19:35.115 --> 19:36.646
She's got a whole bloody concept
planned out

19:36.648 --> 19:39.449
- if you just listen to her.
- Ros, it's okay.

19:39.451 --> 19:40.852
Let me explain it clearer.

19:40.854 --> 19:42.652
This is what gets people
talking.

19:42.654 --> 19:44.855
- What, a shark's eye?
- Your dad loved this stuff.

19:44.857 --> 19:47.225
He knew what the people
of Sandcliff wanted to see.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.558
Yeah, and in case
you've forgotten,

19:48.560 --> 19:50.428
Annie was by his side
the whole time.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.363
Ros, it's okay.
I can handle it.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.898
No, I'm sorry,
but if it wasn't for her

19:53.900 --> 19:56.199
then this whole place
would be boarded up.

19:56.201 --> 19:58.568
This is not what it was
supposed to be.

19:58.570 --> 20:01.771
Summer of '64. Heat wave.
Rock concerts.

20:01.773 --> 20:04.342
The fire at the bingo.

20:04.344 --> 20:05.776
Do you know I've got
the original poster

20:05.778 --> 20:07.812
for the Rolling Stones concert
at the ABC

20:07.814 --> 20:10.180
with their autographs?

20:10.182 --> 20:11.849
That's what I'm talking about,
you see?

20:11.851 --> 20:13.551
All right,
only Bill Wyman signed it,

20:13.553 --> 20:14.919
but that's what people
want to see...

20:14.921 --> 20:16.687
<i>"Bingo. You nailed it.</i>

20:16.689 --> 20:18.389
<i>I couldn't have explained it
better myself.</i>

20:18.391 --> 20:20.624
<i>All good things,
Tucker Crowe.</i>

20:20.626 --> 20:23.460
<i>P.S., the folks
on that website,</i>

20:23.462 --> 20:25.496
<i>they seem pretty weird,</i>

20:25.498 --> 20:28.165
<i>so I'd be grateful if you
didn't pass on the address.</i>

20:28.167 --> 20:30.433
<i>Thanks."</i>

20:30.435 --> 20:32.436
Annie?

20:32.438 --> 20:34.475
Huh?

20:35.807 --> 20:38.241
- Yup, got it.
- Good.

20:38.243 --> 20:40.213
Good.

20:45.184 --> 20:47.351
<i>It isn't really you, is it?</i>

20:47.353 --> 20:49.187
So, what about hot dogs?

20:49.189 --> 20:51.855
Well, I like hot dogs
and you like hot dogs,

20:51.857 --> 20:53.891
but I don't think Lizzie
likes hot dogs.

20:53.893 --> 20:56.326
I've forgotten
who Lizzie is again.

20:56.328 --> 20:58.662
Come on, man.
She's your sister.

20:58.664 --> 21:00.797
Yeah, but why is she my sister?

21:00.799 --> 21:03.401
Because you've got the same dad,
that's why.

21:03.403 --> 21:04.834
- You're her dad, too?
- Yup.

21:04.836 --> 21:07.205
Like you're Cooper
and Jesse's dad?

21:07.207 --> 21:08.405
Bingo.

21:08.407 --> 21:09.907
So, who's her mom this time?

21:09.909 --> 21:11.676
Her mom is Natalie.

21:11.678 --> 21:13.376
Natalie from the school
nurse's office?

21:13.378 --> 21:14.812
She's so nice.

21:14.814 --> 21:17.414
No, Natalie from London,
England.

21:17.416 --> 21:19.283
Lizzie grew up in London,

21:19.285 --> 21:21.952
and now she's going to college
here somewhere upstate.

21:21.954 --> 21:23.653
But why wouldn't she like
hot dogs?

21:23.655 --> 21:25.256
Well, I don't know.
Some people, you know,

21:25.258 --> 21:26.923
they think it's wrong
to eat meat...

21:26.925 --> 21:29.794
<i>Yes, it is really me.</i>

21:29.796 --> 21:32.596
<i>Although, I can't think
of a real way</i>

21:32.598 --> 21:33.998
<i>of proving it to you.</i>

21:34.000 --> 21:36.234
<i>How about this...</i>

21:36.236 --> 21:38.969
<i>I didn't see the face of God
in a Minneapolis toilet bowl.</i>

21:38.971 --> 21:42.640
<i>I haven't been secretly making
R&B albums with Lauryn Hill.</i>

21:42.642 --> 21:45.543
<i>I don't have 200 hours' worth
of material locked in a shed,</i>

21:45.545 --> 21:48.278
<i>contrary to what your friends
on the website may think.</i>

21:48.280 --> 21:52.549
<i>In fact, my guitar hasn't been
out of its case for years.</i>

21:52.551 --> 21:54.852
<i>I currently live
in the garage</i>

21:54.854 --> 21:57.888
<i>behind the house where my son
Jackson lives with my ex.</i>

21:57.890 --> 22:00.360
Can you take this
to your mom?

22:01.426 --> 22:04.362
- What's this?
- It's a check.

22:04.364 --> 22:06.631
- Where'd you get it?
- I earned it.

22:06.633 --> 22:08.999
But you don't do anything.

22:09.001 --> 22:10.668
It's for something I did
a long time ago.

22:10.670 --> 22:12.402
- What are you gonna buy with it?
- Nothing, man.

22:12.404 --> 22:14.805
Just take it, will you?
Thank you.

22:14.807 --> 22:18.008
<i>Jackson's mom has been
letting me stay here rent-free</i>

22:18.010 --> 22:19.844
<i>for the past few years.</i>

22:19.846 --> 22:22.979
<i>So, I guess I owe her a lot.</i>

22:22.981 --> 22:26.316
- Hey, babe.
- <i>And, understandably,</i>

22:26.318 --> 22:28.652
<i>I irritate her.</i>

22:28.654 --> 22:30.621
- Good night.
- Good night.

22:30.623 --> 22:31.855
Have fun.

22:31.857 --> 22:34.057
<i>The point is, if I wasn't me,</i>

22:34.059 --> 22:37.295
<i>I'd have made myself
sound a lot more appealing.</i>

22:37.297 --> 22:40.597
<i>So, yeah, it's me.</i>

22:40.599 --> 22:42.499
<i>Tell me about you.</i>

22:42.501 --> 22:44.605
<i>What's your story?</i>

22:48.540 --> 22:50.807
<i>Thanks for sharing,
but I think I've had enough</i>

22:50.809 --> 22:53.576
<i>Tucker bloody Crowe
to last 20 lifetimes.</i>

22:53.578 --> 22:56.580
Shit.

22:56.582 --> 22:58.015
<i>Fuck it.</i>

22:58.017 --> 23:00.317
<i>Dear Tucker,
as long as we're putting</i>

23:00.319 --> 23:02.652
<i>our least attractive foot
forward,</i>

23:02.654 --> 23:04.689
<i>I am writing this
from my office</i>

23:04.691 --> 23:09.427
<i>under the watchful eye
of a pickled dead shark.</i>

23:09.429 --> 23:11.495
<i>It's the centerpiece
of a show I'm curating</i>

23:11.497 --> 23:13.363
<i>about the summer of '64.</i>

23:13.365 --> 23:15.565
<i>A summer where nothing much
happened, really,</i>

23:15.567 --> 23:18.635
<i>except the beaching of
the aforementioned dead shark.</i>

23:18.637 --> 23:21.404
<i>On the plus side,
the show is a good excuse</i>

23:21.406 --> 23:23.440
<i>to hire my unemployable sister.</i>

23:23.442 --> 23:26.544
God, another one already?
She's married, right?

23:26.546 --> 23:28.746
Yeah, but she reached out
to me on Facebook.

23:28.748 --> 23:30.613
You know,
she said we should catch up.

23:30.615 --> 23:32.115
And you took that
as a romantic overture?

23:32.117 --> 23:33.651
Yeah. For your information,

23:33.653 --> 23:35.452
we actually ended up
snogging in the pub,

23:35.454 --> 23:36.653
and she loved it.

23:36.655 --> 23:38.421
I just...
I don't know,

23:38.423 --> 23:39.890
when we drove home
she got all weird.

23:39.892 --> 23:41.926
Yeah, probably
because of her husband.

23:41.928 --> 23:43.561
Yeah, but you should see
her posts.

23:43.563 --> 23:45.395
It's all like her
and Gary and the baby,

23:45.397 --> 23:46.697
and they're all smiling.

23:46.699 --> 23:48.365
Nothing screams
"repressed lesbian"

23:48.367 --> 23:50.034
like having a husband
and two kids, does it?

23:50.036 --> 23:51.701
I don't know if you're right
about that.

23:51.703 --> 23:53.837
I thought I could just put it
all in an email,

23:53.839 --> 23:56.606
but then I just thought maybe
I'd do like a handwritten note,

23:56.608 --> 23:58.476
because it's more personal,
isn't it?

23:58.478 --> 24:01.478
So I thought I could just put
it in her letterbox later,

24:01.480 --> 24:02.912
- don't you think?
- Are you serious?

24:02.914 --> 24:04.648
- Yeah.
- Don't do that.

24:04.650 --> 24:06.449
Maybe I should go
fish it out.

24:06.451 --> 24:08.119
- Did you do it already?
- Yeah.

24:08.121 --> 24:10.086
Fuck, you're a moron. One second!

24:10.088 --> 24:12.123
Why are you attracted
to these situations?

24:12.125 --> 24:13.524
What is wrong with you?

24:13.526 --> 24:14.995
Come in!

24:16.762 --> 24:19.066
- Ready to look through these?
- Yeah.

24:20.967 --> 24:23.801
<i>You say the truth
about you is disappointing.</i>

24:23.803 --> 24:25.870
<i>At least you have a past
to live up to.</i>

24:25.872 --> 24:27.805
Should I put orange here?

24:27.807 --> 24:29.105
It's your call, man.

24:29.107 --> 24:30.708
What do you think?

24:30.710 --> 24:32.809
Yeah, maybe.

24:32.811 --> 24:36.846
<i>Some creative remnants
that prove you existed.</i>

24:36.848 --> 24:38.716
<i>Anyway...</i>

24:38.718 --> 24:40.617
<i>if you want to see some
old shark parts, just shout.</i>

24:40.619 --> 24:43.487
<i>That's about all
I have to offer right now.</i>

24:43.489 --> 24:45.855
<i>Yours truly...</i>

24:54.534 --> 24:55.966
Tucker?

24:55.968 --> 24:57.901
Lizzie. Hey.

24:57.903 --> 24:59.503
- Hi.
- How was your trip?

24:59.505 --> 25:01.608
On time.

25:04.876 --> 25:06.209
This is Jackson.

25:06.211 --> 25:07.745
- Hi, Jackson.
- Hi, Lizzie.

25:07.747 --> 25:09.046
I'm your brother.

25:09.048 --> 25:10.448
Half-brother, actually.

25:10.450 --> 25:13.049
So, you've changed.

25:13.051 --> 25:14.151
Since I was nine.

25:14.153 --> 25:15.920
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:15.922 --> 25:17.488
Can I...

25:17.490 --> 25:19.155
can I take your bags?

25:19.157 --> 25:20.961
Well, hey...

25:23.829 --> 25:26.399
You want to... yes, great.
Here you go, buddy.

25:27.933 --> 25:30.066
Yeah, hop up front there.

25:30.068 --> 25:32.702
You want a coffee?
You want a...?

25:32.704 --> 25:34.103
Nope, I'm good.

25:34.105 --> 25:36.009
You're good?
Yeah, I'm good, too.

25:37.143 --> 25:38.609
Whoo!

25:38.611 --> 25:41.181
<i>♪ There's nothing left here ♪</i>

25:43.915 --> 25:47.653
<i>♪ Country has disappeared ♪</i>

25:50.155 --> 25:51.889
Lizzie...

25:51.891 --> 25:53.090
Yeah?

25:53.092 --> 25:54.757
Are you coming for Christmas?

25:54.759 --> 25:56.494
Buddy,
she just got here this time.

25:56.496 --> 25:59.529
Just be glad
she's here now.

25:59.531 --> 26:01.198
Jesse and Cooper
are coming at Christmas.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.066
We don't know that
Cooper and Jesse are coming.

26:03.068 --> 26:05.503
- They might come.
- I don't know.

26:05.505 --> 26:06.670
Who are Jesse and Cooper?

26:06.672 --> 26:08.205
They're my brothers.

26:08.207 --> 26:09.907
They're twins.

26:09.909 --> 26:11.978
Cat had kids from before?

26:13.211 --> 26:15.115
No, no, they're mine.

26:17.115 --> 26:19.149
From Carrie?

26:19.151 --> 26:21.285
Yeah, sorry, I...

26:21.287 --> 26:23.019
They're 12, you know?

26:23.021 --> 26:25.154
I just... I thought...

26:25.156 --> 26:27.257
I thought you knew.

26:27.259 --> 26:28.558
What's two more?

26:28.560 --> 26:30.629
Yeah! Right?

26:31.963 --> 26:33.831
Parenting, you know.

26:33.833 --> 26:37.901
Sometimes I think
I could use a manual.

26:37.903 --> 26:40.069
Hmm, for tips such as,

26:40.071 --> 26:42.575
"Always tell your kids
they have siblings"?

26:44.576 --> 26:48.112
Yeah. It sounds obvious
when you say it, but...

26:48.114 --> 26:49.712
I, um...

26:49.714 --> 26:52.716
I tracked down Grace,
by the way.

26:52.718 --> 26:54.955
Who's Grace?

26:56.855 --> 26:58.959
Why would you do that?

27:05.565 --> 27:06.630
Hi, Mom.

27:06.632 --> 27:08.665
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.234
Hey. Welcome.

27:10.236 --> 27:11.834
Nice to finally meet you.

27:11.836 --> 27:14.074
Can I take your coat?

27:20.779 --> 27:22.011
You look beautiful.

27:22.013 --> 27:24.047
Thanks.

27:24.049 --> 27:26.083
<i>Recently, my past
has been catching up with me</i>

27:26.085 --> 27:27.851
<i>in surprising ways.</i>

27:27.853 --> 27:30.086
<i>I just found out
I'm going to be a grandfather.</i>

27:30.088 --> 27:34.357
<i>And, I'm ashamed to say,
my first thought was "fuck!"</i>

27:34.359 --> 27:36.594
<i>I can't be that old.</i>

27:36.596 --> 27:40.163
<i>But I did the math,
and I am.</i>

27:40.165 --> 27:42.165
<i>Naturally,
I lost some years</i>

27:42.167 --> 27:44.301
<i>to copious drugs
and alcohol consumption.</i>

27:44.303 --> 27:46.236
<i>And 14 years of</i> Law & Order.

27:46.238 --> 27:48.372
<i>It's a good show.</i>

27:48.374 --> 27:50.341
<i>You know, I look
at my beautiful daughter</i>

27:50.343 --> 27:52.276
<i>and realize that two decades</i>

27:52.278 --> 27:54.277
<i>have slipped through
my fingers.</i>

27:54.279 --> 27:55.813
So, who's the dad?

27:55.815 --> 27:58.082
His name's Zak.
He lives in my dorm.

27:58.084 --> 27:59.816
He's a musician...

27:59.818 --> 28:01.986
and a big fan.

28:01.988 --> 28:04.354
Well, do you think he's going
to help support the baby?

28:04.356 --> 28:06.055
You mean because
he's a musician?

28:06.057 --> 28:07.157
Yeah.

28:07.159 --> 28:08.792
This one's a good person.

28:08.794 --> 28:11.260
Oh, well, that's a relief.

28:11.262 --> 28:14.331
And, you guys,
are you married?

28:14.333 --> 28:16.132
Oh, well, we were.

28:16.134 --> 28:18.267
Well, never officially.

28:18.269 --> 28:21.037
Yeah, it was official.

28:21.039 --> 28:22.640
- Was it?
- Yeah.

28:22.642 --> 28:23.974
Maybe. I don't know.

28:23.976 --> 28:25.676
We're not together anymore.

28:25.678 --> 28:27.777
- But you run the farm together?
- What farm?

28:27.779 --> 28:29.113
I thought this was
a sheep farm.

28:29.115 --> 28:30.980
It's not a farm.

28:30.982 --> 28:33.049
I mean, I grow some tomatoes,
but, yeah.

28:33.051 --> 28:34.951
Where'd you hear that?

28:34.953 --> 28:36.253
Some weird fan site.

28:36.255 --> 28:38.021
Hmm. What else did they say?

28:38.023 --> 28:40.024
They say you've been holed up
in a music studio,

28:40.026 --> 28:41.357
plotting your comeback.

28:41.359 --> 28:43.427
By studio, do you mean
the old garage

28:43.429 --> 28:46.396
where he sleeps and eats
and watches TV?

28:46.398 --> 28:48.297
Takes care of Jackson.

28:48.299 --> 28:51.067
You should write a letter to the
editor correcting the record.

28:51.069 --> 28:52.402
That way your children
might get

28:52.404 --> 28:54.740
some accurate information
about you.

28:56.107 --> 28:57.975
I'm going back to London
next week.

28:57.977 --> 29:00.244
- I'm having the baby there.
- You're having a baby?

29:00.246 --> 29:01.679
Mm-hmm.

29:01.681 --> 29:02.979
You're going to be an uncle.

29:02.981 --> 29:04.916
Cool, huh?

29:08.988 --> 29:11.721
<i>You mention
your two missing decades.</i>

29:11.723 --> 29:13.390
<i>I myself have a hunch</i>

29:13.392 --> 29:17.126
<i>I've wasted the last 15 years
of my life.</i>

29:17.128 --> 29:19.962
A lot of great shows coming up.
Oh, look at that.

29:19.964 --> 29:23.132
Jupiter Moon are playing
Minehead the 3rd of September.

29:23.134 --> 29:25.334
I must put it in the diary,
to fucking miss it.

29:25.336 --> 29:27.004
Oh, God.

29:27.006 --> 29:30.039
<i>And I'm not sure
what to do about it.</i>

29:30.041 --> 29:31.941
<i>Although, given your history,</i>

29:31.943 --> 29:34.344
<i>it doesn't sound like
you're in a position to advise.</i>

29:34.346 --> 29:37.480
Is it normal for granddads
also to be dads?

29:37.482 --> 29:39.083
Of course.
By definition,

29:39.085 --> 29:41.184
a granddad
has to be a dad first, right?

29:41.186 --> 29:43.987
You couldn't be a granddad
without also being a dad.

29:43.989 --> 29:45.823
Impossible.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.726
Yeah, but none of the other kids
at school

29:48.728 --> 29:51.194
have dads who are also
granddads.

29:51.196 --> 29:53.197
You realize that just because
I'm a granddad

29:53.199 --> 29:54.731
doesn't mean I'm old, right?

29:54.733 --> 29:56.100
I mean, I'm going to live
a long time.

29:56.102 --> 29:58.067
You're going to have kids
of your own,

29:58.069 --> 30:01.904
ex-wives of your own long before
I kick the bucket, all right?

30:01.906 --> 30:04.107
Lean back, I'm going to rinse
your hair.

30:04.109 --> 30:07.143
<i>What to do if you've
wasted 15 years of your life?</i>

30:07.145 --> 30:08.879
<i>All right, first off,</i>

30:08.881 --> 30:10.780
<i>you have to whittle
that number down.</i>

30:10.782 --> 30:12.982
<i>Subtract all the time spent
reading good books,</i>

30:12.984 --> 30:15.486
<i>having enjoyable conversations
and sleeping,</i>

30:15.488 --> 30:17.921
<i>because those
are important things.</i>

30:17.923 --> 30:19.856
<i>And you should be able to bring
that squandered time</i>

30:19.858 --> 30:22.392
<i>down to more like 10,
and anything under a decade</i>

30:22.394 --> 30:24.995
<i>you're allowed to write off
for tax purposes.</i>

30:24.997 --> 30:26.997
<i>That's a joke.</i>

30:26.999 --> 30:30.199
<i>Yeah, I'm still pretty sick
about what I've lost.</i>

30:30.201 --> 30:32.469
<i>But I only admit it
to myself late at night,</i>

30:32.471 --> 30:35.037
<i>which is probably why
I'm not a great sleeper.</i>

30:35.039 --> 30:36.843
<i>I hope this helps.</i>

30:37.874 --> 30:39.242
<i>Sorry. But, still,
maybe it'd be useful</i>

30:39.244 --> 30:42.181
<i>to know more the specifics
of your situation.</i>

30:43.982 --> 30:46.452
- <i>Do you really want to...</i>
- Annie!

30:50.256 --> 30:53.824
<i>Do you really want
to know the specifics?</i>

30:53.826 --> 30:55.359
You sure you're good
with the salad?

30:55.361 --> 30:56.794
Yeah.

30:56.796 --> 30:57.894
Easy on the olive oil.

30:57.896 --> 30:59.395
You just want to drizzle it.

30:59.397 --> 31:01.265
<i>My boyfriend and I
are child-free.</i>

31:01.267 --> 31:04.433
<i>A conscious decision we made,
rather smugly,</i>

31:04.435 --> 31:06.536
<i>thinking parenthood
would be a miserable trap</i>

31:06.538 --> 31:08.205
<i>we'd cleverly avoid.</i>

31:08.207 --> 31:10.274
<i>But there's more to it
than that.</i>

31:10.276 --> 31:13.309
<i>My dad died
when Ros was only 12,</i>

31:13.311 --> 31:15.478
<i>and we'd already lost our mom.</i>

31:15.480 --> 31:17.346
<i>So it was just the two of us.</i>

31:17.348 --> 31:19.349
<i>By the time my boyfriend and I
moved in together,</i>

31:19.351 --> 31:22.385
<i>I'd had my share
of parenting.</i>

31:22.387 --> 31:24.388
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

31:24.390 --> 31:27.457
<i>Now, with irritating
predictability,</i>

31:27.459 --> 31:30.093
<i>I've started aching
for a child,</i>

31:30.095 --> 31:31.894
<i>for all the usual reasons,</i>

31:31.896 --> 31:34.565
<i>like wanting to feel
unconditional love,</i>

31:34.567 --> 31:38.101
<i>as opposed to faint,
conditional affection.</i>

31:38.103 --> 31:39.536
Hurry up, Annie!

31:39.538 --> 31:41.404
Don't dare put
truffle oil on mine.

31:41.406 --> 31:43.207
Yeah, I'm coming.

31:43.209 --> 31:45.508
Drizzle it.

31:45.510 --> 31:48.478
<i>I fantasize about things
like being able to sit up</i>

31:48.480 --> 31:50.146
<i>with my teenage daughter
late at night</i>

31:50.148 --> 31:51.849
<i>and help her work through</i>

31:51.851 --> 31:54.254
<i>her first terrible
sexual experience.</i>

31:55.855 --> 31:57.888
<i>Does that sound demented?</i>

31:57.890 --> 31:59.623
<i>Last year I tried
to bring up</i>

31:59.625 --> 32:02.191
<i>the whole baby thing again
to my boyfriend,</i>

32:02.193 --> 32:04.228
<i>and let's just say
he shut it down.</i>

32:04.230 --> 32:06.229
<i>I've sometimes wondered
what would happen</i>

32:06.231 --> 32:08.431
<i>if I just decided
to blow up my whole life</i>

32:08.433 --> 32:11.334
<i>and have a kid on my own.</i>

32:11.336 --> 32:13.135
<i>But then reality hits me
and suddenly I realize,</i>

32:13.137 --> 32:15.972
<i>who the fuck am I kidding?
I can't do that.</i>

32:15.974 --> 32:17.908
- Bridget has a kid on her own.
- Case in point.

32:17.910 --> 32:20.276
She's the most depressing person
on the planet.

32:20.278 --> 32:23.913
<i>I'm sorry about that ache.</i>

32:23.915 --> 32:25.548
<i>I wish I knew
the thing to say.</i>

32:25.550 --> 32:28.384
<i>I don't imagine this
is much of a consolation,</i>

32:28.386 --> 32:30.519
<i>but I've brought a lot of kids
into the world,</i>

32:30.521 --> 32:32.355
<i>and most of them
are just reminders</i>

32:32.357 --> 32:35.092
<i>of how I've blown it
in that department.</i>

32:35.094 --> 32:37.995
<i>Sometimes my life looks like
an endless streak</i>

32:37.997 --> 32:41.131
<i>of staring responsibility
directly in the eye,</i>

32:41.133 --> 32:43.569
<i>and then running
the other way.</i>

32:45.069 --> 32:46.572
Hey.

32:48.973 --> 32:51.040
So, if the spirit
ever moves you...

32:53.412 --> 32:55.478
Hey, how do you even know
about Grace?

32:55.480 --> 32:58.148
You let it slip to Mom
back when you were in love

32:58.150 --> 33:00.186
and X-ing or something.

33:01.987 --> 33:07.457
Look, I realize it's an
unforgivable chapter of my life,

33:07.459 --> 33:12.398
but I'm hoping not to be judged
by that alone, okay?

33:13.699 --> 33:15.699
- Okay.
- We're heading out. Let's go.

33:15.701 --> 33:17.433
Just trying to do a better job,
you know?

33:17.435 --> 33:21.438
I mean, that shouldn't
be too hard, you know?

33:21.440 --> 33:23.073
- You...
- Yeah.

33:23.075 --> 33:25.609
You going to take care
of yourself,

33:25.611 --> 33:27.276
and do what the doctor
tells you,

33:27.278 --> 33:28.946
and eat your prenatal vitamins
and all that?

33:28.948 --> 33:31.047
- Yes.
- Okay, then, give me a hug.

33:31.049 --> 33:32.518
Okay.

33:35.019 --> 33:36.420
Lizzie...

33:36.422 --> 33:38.055
Yeah?

33:38.057 --> 33:39.488
...thank you for coming.

33:39.490 --> 33:41.961
I wish it was more fun.

33:42.994 --> 33:45.130
It's all right.

33:46.131 --> 33:47.331
Bye, Tucker.

33:47.333 --> 33:48.668
Bye.

34:00.378 --> 34:03.346
<i>Is it weird to say I'm
jealous of your selfish impulses?</i>

34:03.348 --> 34:07.351
<i>Somehow, every time I face
an irresponsible desire,</i>

34:07.353 --> 34:10.322
<i>fear convinces me
to stay put.</i>

34:11.690 --> 34:13.623
<i>I keep thinking
at some point,</i>

34:13.625 --> 34:16.425
<i>there'll be a reward
for being so sensible.</i>

34:16.427 --> 34:17.525
Duncan?

34:17.527 --> 34:18.728
Can I have a word?

34:18.731 --> 34:20.030
What did I do?

34:20.032 --> 34:21.664
- Oh, no, nothing.
- Oh.

34:21.666 --> 34:24.467
It's just,
I read your blog.

34:24.469 --> 34:26.369
Someone's looking
for extra credit.

34:26.371 --> 34:30.039
You have quite a thing
for Tucker Crowe.

34:30.041 --> 34:31.407
Guilty.

34:31.409 --> 34:33.309
Television has always
been my mistress,

34:33.311 --> 34:35.445
but Tucker is really my...

34:35.447 --> 34:37.713
- Your wife?
- It's a flawed analogy.

34:37.715 --> 34:39.614
Then I spent the whole night

34:39.617 --> 34:42.351
trying to find somewhere
to stream <i>Juliet, Naked.</i>

34:42.353 --> 34:44.152
- Oh, she's elusive.
- Oh, she is.

34:44.155 --> 34:46.623
- Let me tell you straight...
- Oh, God, there's my bus.

34:46.625 --> 34:48.661
- Sorry.
- Oh, no...

34:50.661 --> 34:52.364

"We're in Trouble".

35:19.757 --> 35:21.557
What?

35:21.559 --> 35:24.528
The name of this song:
"We're in Trouble".

35:26.798 --> 35:30.066
<i>It's really odd to be
saying all this to a stranger,</i>

35:30.068 --> 35:32.371
<i>or whatever it is you are,
Tucker.</i>

35:34.505 --> 35:36.338
<i>I've just read
through this thread</i>

35:36.340 --> 35:38.141
<i>and I've realized
I've been sharing thoughts</i>

35:38.143 --> 35:40.476
<i>I've never said aloud
to anybody.</i>

35:40.478 --> 35:43.079
<i>That's not a good sign, is it?</i>

35:43.081 --> 35:45.115
<i>I mean, maybe it is,
but I've told my boyfriend</i>

35:45.117 --> 35:46.650
<i>nothing of our little
email affair.</i>

35:46.652 --> 35:49.588
<i>It's like I'm dabbling
in betrayal.</i>

35:52.291 --> 35:54.090
<i>Shit.
Please delete that last email.</i>

35:54.092 --> 35:55.559
<i>I don't know
where that came from.</i>

35:55.561 --> 35:57.360
<i>"Betrayal"?</i>

35:57.362 --> 36:00.530
<i>That's so dramatic. Ignore.</i>

36:00.532 --> 36:02.231
<i>Sorry. Too late.</i>

36:02.233 --> 36:03.867
<i>I opened it.</i>

36:03.869 --> 36:05.735
<i>I read it.</i>

36:05.737 --> 36:07.407
<i>And I loved it.</i>

36:13.612 --> 36:16.612
And by "met" I presume
we're talking

36:16.614 --> 36:18.514
about more
than just meeting.

36:18.516 --> 36:19.682
Yes.

36:19.684 --> 36:22.452
A bit more than that.

36:22.454 --> 36:24.490
You slept with her.

36:25.824 --> 36:27.757
- Who is she?
- Oh, you wouldn't know her.

36:27.759 --> 36:29.391
Who are you sleeping with?

36:29.393 --> 36:31.427
You know,
I wouldn't use

36:31.429 --> 36:33.829
the present continuous,
personally.

36:33.831 --> 36:37.166
I think that "Who have you slept
with" is a fairer question.

36:37.168 --> 36:41.137
Even better, "With whom did this
possibly one-off incident...?"

36:41.139 --> 36:44.240
Oh, my God, Duncan!
Just shut up and tell me!

36:44.242 --> 36:48.545
Gina is the lady's...

36:48.547 --> 36:50.246
she's junior faculty...

36:50.248 --> 36:51.380
She's a colleague from work.

36:51.382 --> 36:52.816
- She's...
- Of course.

36:52.818 --> 36:54.818
Don't tell me, what,
it just happened?

36:54.820 --> 36:56.186
Not really.

36:56.188 --> 36:59.155
We just kind of clicked,
I guess.

36:59.157 --> 37:01.224
I actually had played her
<i>Juliet, Naked,</i>

37:01.226 --> 37:03.226
- and she really responded...
- Stop, stop, stop.

37:03.228 --> 37:04.427
Why are you telling me this?

37:04.429 --> 37:06.195
Because you asked.

37:06.197 --> 37:07.863
And I thought it best
to be honest.

37:07.865 --> 37:09.532
Oh, you did?

37:09.534 --> 37:11.200
And if I'm honest...

37:11.202 --> 37:12.936
I feel better.

37:12.938 --> 37:17.206
I think that you would feel
exactly the same in my shoes.

37:17.208 --> 37:18.807
I would never just be honest
about cheating

37:18.809 --> 37:20.809
to make myself
feel better.

37:20.811 --> 37:23.445
Okay, and then how would I know
if you had cheated?

37:23.447 --> 37:25.514
I wouldn't do it
in the first place.

37:25.516 --> 37:28.284
Lamb bhuna and a chicken korma.

37:28.286 --> 37:30.287
Mine is the lamb.

37:30.289 --> 37:31.757
Enjoy.

37:37.396 --> 37:39.798
I've really messed up,
haven't I?

37:41.567 --> 37:43.668
That's what I thought.

37:44.635 --> 37:46.536
Can I ask...

37:46.538 --> 37:48.905
do you think there's any way
back for me?

37:48.907 --> 37:52.879
Because, right now,
I think that's how I'm leaning.

37:54.646 --> 37:56.449
Oh...

38:06.224 --> 38:07.691
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Annie, easy.

38:07.693 --> 38:09.258
We don't need to do it all
straightaway.

38:09.260 --> 38:11.697
I know, I'm not going
to tear them.

38:13.831 --> 38:16.633
God. Fuck.

38:16.635 --> 38:19.302
I mean, this just makes it
feel so real.

38:19.304 --> 38:21.670
It is real, Duncan.

38:21.672 --> 38:23.472
I know.

38:23.474 --> 38:26.443
I'm just saying, there's a lot
of history in this room.

38:26.445 --> 38:29.311
It feels like we're being
very hasty.

38:29.313 --> 38:30.914
Plus, it's raining out.

38:30.916 --> 38:32.916
You know this stuff
can't get wet.

38:32.918 --> 38:34.883
- You have Simon's car.
- Yeah, but then

38:34.885 --> 38:36.519
there's the walk
from here to the car.

38:36.521 --> 38:38.787
I mean, cardboard, water...

38:41.260 --> 38:44.526
I don't have the right boxes
for it.

38:44.528 --> 38:45.894
I don't.

38:45.896 --> 38:48.601
Can we just do it soon, please?

38:57.708 --> 38:59.675
I got it. Got it.

38:59.677 --> 39:01.577
I don't have
the fingernails.

39:01.579 --> 39:03.782
Just keep it. Just keep it.
Keep it.

Nothing. No, it's nothing.
I was just, you know...

39:58.369 --> 40:00.804
I've got the museum
and the house, and you're here,

40:00.806 --> 40:01.938

40:01.940 --> 40:03.405
I'm not just an excuse, Annie.

40:03.407 --> 40:05.342
I can look after myself.

40:05.344 --> 40:07.443
I'm not 12 anymore.

40:09.347 --> 40:11.347
Care to dance?

40:11.349 --> 40:13.083
- Oh, sorry, love, I'm a lesbian.
- No, you're not.

40:13.085 --> 40:15.418
That's what birds say when they
don't want to take me home.

40:15.420 --> 40:18.554
Can't speak for the rest,
but I was gay before you danced.

40:18.556 --> 40:21.557
What about you?
Do you like men?

40:21.559 --> 40:22.891
Yeah, some men.

40:22.893 --> 40:26.662
- Noted. Moving on.
- All right.

40:26.664 --> 40:28.865
- Well, that was rude, wasn't it?
- How was that rude?

40:28.867 --> 40:32.802
Imagine those moves in the sack.
Wow, he's very flexible.

40:32.804 --> 40:35.505
- You need a proper shag, don't you?
- Is that so?

40:38.443 --> 40:40.642
- Well, well. That explains it.
- What?

40:40.644 --> 40:42.010
You already fancy someone,
don't you?

40:42.012 --> 40:43.646
- No.
- Come on, cough it up.

40:43.648 --> 40:46.548
- Who is it?
- It's nobody. It's just...

40:46.550 --> 40:49.586
well, I did...
I met someone on the Internet.

40:49.588 --> 40:51.653
I love it. The Internet.

40:51.655 --> 40:53.990
God, you're finally entering
the modern age.

40:53.992 --> 40:56.860
Which site was it?
One for clever people, no doubt.

40:56.862 --> 40:58.795
HornierStories.com?

40:58.797 --> 41:00.729
Duncan's website.

41:00.731 --> 41:02.164
Another Tucker Crowe loser?

41:02.166 --> 41:04.467
Oh, Jesus, Annie,
are you mental?

41:04.469 --> 41:06.403
No, it's weirder
than that.

41:06.405 --> 41:09.171
It's actually
Tucker Crowe.

41:09.173 --> 41:10.673
- No, it's not.
- I'm not kidding.

41:10.675 --> 41:12.108
Tucker Crowe.

41:12.110 --> 41:14.144
As in, Duncan's idol
Tucker Crowe.

41:14.146 --> 41:16.679
Yes. What happened was
he read that review I posted.

41:16.681 --> 41:19.014
- This is that syndrome.
- What syndrome?

41:19.016 --> 41:21.117
Where someone falls in love
with their captor.

41:21.119 --> 41:23.052
We're never...
you know, we're just pen pals.

41:23.054 --> 41:25.054
We were pen pals.

41:25.056 --> 41:26.889
I don't know what
you're supposed to call it.

41:26.891 --> 41:28.724
We were just having...
emailing back and forth.

41:28.726 --> 41:29.858
Yeah, I don't know.

41:29.860 --> 41:31.528
Oh, look at that.

41:31.530 --> 41:33.028
Go on, Annie. Dance with him.
Have some fun.

41:33.030 --> 41:35.030
- I really don't want to.
- I'm Barnsey.

41:35.032 --> 41:37.434
Hi, Barnsey. I'm Annie.

41:37.436 --> 41:39.436
- Come on, Annie.
- It looks pretty complicated.

41:39.438 --> 41:40.936
- Come on, I'll teach you.
- Go on, Annie.

41:40.938 --> 41:43.440
- It wouldn't hurt to move a bit.
- Exactly, come on.

41:46.644 --> 41:48.644
- Something like that.
- You fucking kidding me?

41:48.646 --> 41:50.447
- Okay? Come on.
- I'm not doing that.

I'm dying to hear

45:37.442 --> 45:38.907

- I had a heart attack.
- <i>What?</i>

45:40.778 --> 45:43.148
Mm-hm.
Well, it was mild, but, um...

45:44.815 --> 45:45.981
it was enough.

45:45.983 --> 45:47.652
<i>Are you serious?</i>

45:48.952 --> 45:52.088
Are you okay?
What can I do?

45:52.090 --> 45:54.956
I was hoping to lure you
to University College Hospital,

45:54.958 --> 45:56.224
cardiology wing?

45:56.226 --> 45:57.760
<i>Of course.</i>

45:57.762 --> 45:59.162
Yeah, of course.

45:59.164 --> 46:00.796
Just...

46:00.798 --> 46:02.298
Oh, sorry.

46:02.300 --> 46:04.032
Can I get you anything?

46:04.034 --> 46:06.034
No, yeah. I don't need anything.
Maybe something to read.

46:06.036 --> 46:08.304
No problem. Is Jackson okay?
Is he there with you?

46:08.306 --> 46:11.007
<i>Oh, no, no. He's fine.
He's doing good.</i>

46:11.009 --> 46:13.711
Thanks for asking.

46:34.164 --> 46:35.867
Hello?

46:39.036 --> 46:40.403
Oh, hi.

46:40.405 --> 46:41.871
Hi.

46:41.873 --> 46:43.940
You must be Annie.

46:43.942 --> 46:46.842
- Come on in.
- Yes.

46:46.844 --> 46:48.443
- I would stand up, but...
- No, please.

46:48.445 --> 46:49.845
Oh, my goodness.

46:49.847 --> 46:51.817
How are you?

46:52.983 --> 46:54.786
Hey.

46:59.891 --> 47:02.291
Sorry, I'm blanking.

47:02.293 --> 47:06.095
This is much easier
in writing.

47:06.097 --> 47:10.032
Well, I would say that we could
take out our phones, you know,

47:10.034 --> 47:11.434
and write each other,

47:11.436 --> 47:14.269
but the Internet here
is terrible.

47:16.541 --> 47:18.407
I got you...

47:18.409 --> 47:20.041
See, I knew I shouldn't
have said that.

47:20.043 --> 47:21.543
It's nothing, honestly.

47:21.545 --> 47:24.313
- No, it's... thank you.
- No, no. Not at all.

47:24.315 --> 47:27.150
Yeah, it's about a transatlantic
epistolary friendship.

47:27.152 --> 47:28.950
Not to put too fine a point
on it.

47:28.952 --> 47:30.353
I think I saw this movie.

47:30.355 --> 47:32.121
It's not nearly as good
as the memoir.

47:32.123 --> 47:35.057
But, obviously, no pressure
to read it, of course.

47:35.059 --> 47:37.025
Pressure's a choice, right?

47:37.027 --> 47:39.295
- Thank you.
- How are you feeling? How do you feel?

47:39.297 --> 47:40.963
Um...

47:40.965 --> 47:42.865
I had an angioplasty.

47:42.867 --> 47:44.566
Wow, what's an angioplasty?

47:44.568 --> 47:47.537
They stick balloons into you
and blow them up.

47:47.539 --> 47:50.238
Wow, balloons.

47:50.240 --> 47:53.108
- That sounds really crazy.
- Jackson, this is Annie.

47:53.110 --> 47:54.911
- Hey. Nice to meet you, Jackson.
- Hi, Annie.

47:54.913 --> 47:56.845
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Oh, no.

47:56.847 --> 47:59.514
Just need to change
your catheter, Mr. Crowe.

47:59.516 --> 48:01.383
Where does that go?

48:01.385 --> 48:04.253
Shall we...
shall we get a snack?

48:04.255 --> 48:06.889
- That'd be great, thank you.
- Why don't we go for a walk?

48:06.891 --> 48:08.858
Okay, we'll be back.

48:10.128 --> 48:11.894
So, how was your trip
over here?

48:11.896 --> 48:14.362
- Did you watch anything?
- <i>Dora.</i>

48:14.364 --> 48:16.097
Oh.

48:16.099 --> 48:18.400
Do bumpy plane rides
give people heart attacks?

48:18.402 --> 48:22.037
Um...

48:22.039 --> 48:25.340
Yeah, I think they could
probably contribute, actually.

48:25.342 --> 48:27.909
Hmm...
probably what happened.

48:27.911 --> 48:29.945
Your dad probably
just got a bit nervous.

48:29.947 --> 48:32.283
But then wouldn't more people
get heart attacks on planes?

48:34.184 --> 48:36.918
Yeah, that's a good point.

48:36.920 --> 48:38.220
Yeah.

48:38.222 --> 48:39.521
You want a bite?

48:39.523 --> 48:41.159
Sure. Thanks.

48:42.260 --> 48:43.492
So, he's in the NICU, huh?

48:43.494 --> 48:45.126
How much does he weigh?

48:45.128 --> 48:46.628
Last night, he was like
2.2 pounds or something.

48:46.630 --> 48:48.563
- Wow.
- Kilos, Zak.

48:48.565 --> 48:50.967
- Otherwise, he'd be dead.
- Okay, that's better.

48:50.969 --> 48:52.969
And how about you?
How are you feeling?

48:52.971 --> 48:54.170
Fine.

48:54.172 --> 48:56.171
How are you feeling?

48:56.173 --> 48:57.940
I'm okay.

48:57.942 --> 48:59.275
- Hey.
- Hey, little man.

48:59.277 --> 49:00.876
- Lizzie, Zak.
- Hey, Annie,

49:00.878 --> 49:02.577
I want you to meet my daughter,
Lizzie.

49:02.579 --> 49:05.081
Lizzie, this is Annie.
And Annie, this is Zak.

49:05.083 --> 49:07.182
This is the man of the hour.
The father.

49:07.184 --> 49:08.550
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

49:08.552 --> 49:10.286
Congratulations
on your little boy.

49:10.288 --> 49:12.121
- Is he okay?
- His name's Dexter

49:12.123 --> 49:13.356
and he's doing good.

49:13.358 --> 49:14.590
He's 2.2 kilos.

49:14.592 --> 49:16.258
Annie's my friend from England.

49:16.260 --> 49:17.894
We were supposed
to hook up yesterday,

49:17.896 --> 49:21.162
but then that didn't go so well.

49:21.164 --> 49:24.166
- We don't even know each other...
- Well, we know each other.

49:24.168 --> 49:26.334
We met on a website.

49:26.336 --> 49:28.304
- A website?
- Not that kind of website.

49:28.306 --> 49:29.671
Yeah, not like...

49:29.673 --> 49:31.606
- it was a music forum.
- Wow.

49:31.608 --> 49:34.010
I'm actually going to head off.
It was lovely to meet you.

49:34.012 --> 49:36.311
- Hey, Annie, please don't go.
- I hope your boy is doing good.

49:36.313 --> 49:38.313
- I want to talk...
- Cooper! Jesse!

49:38.315 --> 49:41.316
Cooper? Jesse?
What are you guys doing here?

49:41.318 --> 49:43.052
These are my sons,
Cooper and Jessie.

49:43.054 --> 49:45.054
Come here, guys.
Give it in for your dad.

49:45.056 --> 49:47.289
Give me a hug, man.
Look at you. You're so tall.

49:47.291 --> 49:49.358
Wow. Man, check you out.

49:49.360 --> 49:52.130
Man, you're handsome.
Hey, guess what.

49:53.331 --> 49:55.130
This is your sister, Lizzie.

49:55.132 --> 49:56.565
- This is Cooper and Jessie.
- Half-sister.

49:56.567 --> 49:58.367
- Yeah, I know. Half-sister.
- Hi.

49:58.369 --> 50:01.537
Cooper's the tall one.
Jessie is the also tall one.

50:01.539 --> 50:03.438
So, how'd you guys find me?
How'd you get here?

50:03.440 --> 50:06.041
Hey.

50:06.043 --> 50:07.376
- How'd you guys get here?
- We flew.

50:07.378 --> 50:08.644
- Plane.
- I called Carrie.

50:08.646 --> 50:10.646
You called Carrie?

50:10.648 --> 50:13.316
- No.
- We thought you were gonna die

50:13.318 --> 50:15.717
and you might want to see your
children, whom I've never met.

50:15.719 --> 50:17.552
Even if I was going to die...

50:17.554 --> 50:19.121
- I'm going to slip away.
- Two seconds.

50:19.123 --> 50:20.523
I want to talk to you.
Oh, my God. Wait...

50:20.525 --> 50:22.958
- What is going on?
- Don't go.

50:22.960 --> 50:25.226
Hi, Carrie.
Apparently I'm going to make it.

50:25.228 --> 50:26.628
The doctor said
I was brilliant

50:26.630 --> 50:28.396
for having a heart attack
in a hospital.

50:28.398 --> 50:30.298
All this way and you're fine?

50:30.300 --> 50:32.133
Yeah, I'm sorry
to disappoint you.

50:32.135 --> 50:35.403
- $10,000. Perfect.
- What does that mean, $10,000?

50:35.405 --> 50:38.641
They weren't gonna fly coach to
see their biological father die.

50:38.643 --> 50:40.742
Anyway, we're fine,
thanks for asking.

50:40.744 --> 50:43.445
You didn't give me two seconds,
all right?

50:43.447 --> 50:44.746
How are you? How's...

50:44.748 --> 50:47.215
- What's your stepdad's name?
- Doug.

50:47.217 --> 50:49.418
- Thank you. How's Doug?
- He's great.

50:49.420 --> 50:51.420
- He's training for a triathlon.
- Oh!

50:51.422 --> 50:53.588
Sorry, I know, exercise,
big trigger for you.

50:53.590 --> 50:55.458
It's not a trigger,
it's just who does that?

50:55.460 --> 50:57.392
- There he is. Tucker.
- Oh. Hey.

50:57.394 --> 51:00.128
Didn't get off
to the best of starts,

51:00.130 --> 51:02.565
have you, Tucker?
Hello, darling.

51:02.567 --> 51:04.499
And it's pretty ripe
in here, Tucker.

51:04.501 --> 51:06.101
Are you due a sponge bath?

51:06.103 --> 51:08.137
Natalie,
this is my friend Annie.

51:08.139 --> 51:11.474
Annie, this is my ex,
Natalie and Mark.

51:11.476 --> 51:15.211
And, Natalie, you and Carrie,
you two have met, right?

51:15.213 --> 51:17.045
- Yeah, fuck. Right.
- How do you do?

51:17.047 --> 51:18.748
Oh, come off it, Natalie.

51:18.750 --> 51:21.249
I also called Grace.

51:21.251 --> 51:23.385
What's going on with you?

51:23.387 --> 51:25.121
- Lizzie, what...?
- Who's Grace?

51:25.123 --> 51:27.255
Your daughter.
This has gone on long enough.

51:27.257 --> 51:29.592
- What's gone on long enough?
- You pretending we don't exist.

51:29.594 --> 51:31.693
I'm not pretending
you don't exist.

51:31.695 --> 51:33.628
I came all the way over here
to see you.

51:33.630 --> 51:35.463
- That's unclear.
- What does that mean?

51:35.465 --> 51:39.467
Honestly, I can vouch for him.
Nothing to do with...

51:39.469 --> 51:41.170
It was complete coincidence.

51:41.172 --> 51:43.472
- Even so.
- What do you mean?

51:43.474 --> 51:46.742
- I flew 3,500 miles to see you.
- Oh, look at him bean-counting.

51:46.744 --> 51:48.711
- He did that with the divorce.
- Bean-counting?

51:48.713 --> 51:50.412
- I'm explaining the reason...
- Dad!

51:50.414 --> 51:52.648
- Jackson, please, stop...
- He's quite the martyr.

51:52.650 --> 51:54.316
He's taking time out
of his busy schedule

51:54.318 --> 51:56.284
to meet his grandson
for the first time.

51:56.286 --> 51:57.787
I'm not being a martyr, okay?

51:57.789 --> 51:59.255
I'm just trying
to point out the fact

51:59.257 --> 52:01.456
that I flew all this way
to see you

52:01.458 --> 52:03.525
and meet the baby, okay?

52:03.527 --> 52:06.494
- We're around your hospital bed.
- I had a heart attack.

52:06.496 --> 52:09.065
- You think I planned that?
- Maybe. Subconsciously.

52:09.067 --> 52:10.532
- Dad!
- I've had three heart attacks,

52:10.534 --> 52:12.267
- and I didn't plan any.
- You had three?

52:12.269 --> 52:14.637
And didn't make
a song and dance about them.

52:14.639 --> 52:16.371
I'm not making
a song and dance.

52:16.373 --> 52:19.141
Frankly, I didn't invite
any of you in here, okay?

52:19.143 --> 52:21.409
See, that is exactly
what I'm talking about.

52:21.411 --> 52:24.146
- Come on, don't be so sensitive.
- Like we're this inconvenience.

52:24.148 --> 52:26.782
- Like you hate us all.
- I don't hate you.

52:26.784 --> 52:30.119
That's not what I'm saying.
Come on, I'm under siege here.

52:30.121 --> 52:31.619
If you really cared about us,

52:31.621 --> 52:33.322
you'd want us to know
our siblings, for example.

52:33.324 --> 52:35.090
What am I supposed to do,
have a picnic?

52:35.092 --> 52:37.092
At least check in
like a normal father.

52:37.094 --> 52:40.162
Yeah, well, this is not...
Stop it, Jackson.

52:40.164 --> 52:43.499
This is not a normal situation,
for Christ's sake.

52:43.501 --> 52:46.601
- Dad!
- Jackson, stop it, okay?

52:46.603 --> 52:48.503
Jackson, I'm sorry.

52:48.505 --> 52:50.338
The doctor said
you need to rest.

52:50.340 --> 52:52.874
Okay. Hey, Zak, come on.
Hey, buddy.

52:52.876 --> 52:54.543
Zak, play that song
that you were talking...

52:54.545 --> 52:56.612
- My song?
- Don't do it, Zak.

52:56.614 --> 52:58.280
He is really just trying
to change the subject.

52:58.282 --> 53:00.182
- I really want to hear it.
- He doesn't care.

53:00.184 --> 53:02.485
- I'm begging you.
- You'll make a fool of yourself.

53:02.487 --> 53:04.385
No, dude, play the song.

53:07.557 --> 53:10.358
♪ She's so high ♪

53:10.360 --> 53:12.695

53:42.492 --> 53:45.561
It's pretty crazy
in there, huh?

53:45.563 --> 53:47.798
Whose mom are you again?

53:49.867 --> 53:51.503
I'm nobody's mom.

53:53.503 --> 53:55.673
- It was nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

53:59.342 --> 54:02.213
- Bye, Annie.
- Bye.

54:12.956 --> 54:14.722
Hello?

54:14.724 --> 54:16.624
<i>Thank you for picking up.</i>

54:16.626 --> 54:19.862
- Okay, I owe you an apology.
- <i>No.</i>

54:19.864 --> 54:21.664
It was silly of me
to have come.

54:21.666 --> 54:23.699
I don't know
what I was thinking.

54:23.701 --> 54:26.267
<i>No, it was kind of you to come.</i>

54:26.269 --> 54:27.702
- Oh...
- <i>Look...</i>

54:27.704 --> 54:29.704
one of the big problems
with screwing up

54:29.706 --> 54:32.840
the first half of your life is,
you know, try as you might,

54:32.842 --> 54:34.809
you can't press reset,
you know?

54:34.811 --> 54:36.512
I mean, I...

54:36.514 --> 54:38.746
I can't get to zero,
you know?

54:38.748 --> 54:40.849
And I was just wondering
if you would...

54:40.851 --> 54:43.985
If we could try this
one more time again tomorrow?

54:43.987 --> 54:46.621
Are they still there,
your ex-girlfriends?

54:46.623 --> 54:48.557
- <i>They were very nice.</i>
- No, no, everybody's gone.

54:48.559 --> 54:50.992
- Hey.
- Everybody except Jackson,

54:50.994 --> 54:52.628
says Jackson.

54:52.630 --> 54:54.530
<i>Here he is.
He wants to talk to you.</i>

54:54.532 --> 54:56.764
<i>Hi, Annie.
I found out what a catheter is.</i>

55:01.338 --> 55:04.673
You know, the truth is, I was...

55:04.675 --> 55:06.708
I was secretly hoping
that maybe you would

55:06.710 --> 55:10.813
invite Jackson and me
to Sandcliff.

55:10.815 --> 55:13.249
- Sandcliff? Jesus, why?
- Sandcliff.

55:13.251 --> 55:14.516
Because we looked it up
on the Internet,

55:14.518 --> 55:15.950
and it looked great.

55:15.952 --> 55:17.786
Like a great place to recover,
you know?

55:17.788 --> 55:19.887
And, look, I blew it yesterday,
you know?

55:19.889 --> 55:22.691
- I want to make it up to you.
- By inviting yourself over?

55:22.693 --> 55:24.525
That's what I was thinking.

55:24.527 --> 55:26.262
What about your family?

55:26.264 --> 55:28.030
Well, the boys
went to the airport.

55:28.032 --> 55:29.932
They're flying home, right?

55:29.934 --> 55:32.333
And Lizzie's, you know,
getting some much-needed rest.

55:32.335 --> 55:34.637
I just don't think I'm equipped
to look after you.

55:34.639 --> 55:36.405
I wouldn't know how
to give you an angioplasty,

55:36.407 --> 55:37.873
or whatever it is
with the balloons.

55:37.875 --> 55:39.641
- Angioplasty?
- If, God forbid, something...

55:39.643 --> 55:41.276
That's a little forward,
don't you think?

55:41.278 --> 55:43.012
Sorry, that did sound
vaguely inappropriate.

55:43.014 --> 55:44.746
But you know what I mean,
and it's just...

55:44.748 --> 55:46.882
I don't know if it'd be fun
for Jackson, really,

55:46.884 --> 55:48.617
to be honest,
it's not such a fun place.

55:48.619 --> 55:50.052
Well, you still have
that shark's eye?

55:50.054 --> 55:51.720
- What? Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:51.722 --> 55:53.554
Well, that's a happy afternoon
right there.

55:53.556 --> 55:55.324
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

55:55.326 --> 55:57.025
You have a shark's eye?

55:57.027 --> 55:58.559
Would that interest you?

55:58.561 --> 56:01.362
Yeah, I love sharks.
Look at my bag.

56:01.364 --> 56:02.930
Waterloo station, Jackson.

56:02.932 --> 56:04.532
Most famous spot
in all of London.

56:04.534 --> 56:06.302
- Really?
- For real.

Because I really need to pee.

56:33.396 --> 56:36.331
Here, Jackson. It's just...
it's just in here, my dear.

56:36.333 --> 56:38.335
Just up here.

56:44.775 --> 56:46.374
There you go, buddy.

56:46.376 --> 56:47.809
Okay, I'll leave it to you.

56:47.811 --> 56:50.012
Can you stay?

56:50.014 --> 56:51.579
Yeah. Sure.

57:13.003 --> 57:15.403
Don't forget to wash your hands,
buddy.

57:15.405 --> 57:17.005
Show her what we're made of.

57:17.007 --> 57:19.874
Wow, this place is nice.

57:19.876 --> 57:21.909
Yeah.

57:21.911 --> 57:24.048
Beautiful spot.

57:41.865 --> 57:43.835
Oh, uh...

57:46.771 --> 57:48.804
Tucker, are you...?

57:48.806 --> 57:51.740
Tucker, you're not downstairs,
are you?

57:51.742 --> 57:53.008
Because I...

57:53.010 --> 57:55.110
I must explain this.

57:55.112 --> 57:57.012
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I've...

57:57.014 --> 57:58.880
I can explain this.

57:58.882 --> 58:01.048
"Maxwell's, '89,

58:01.050 --> 58:03.651
Bar Astro-Dusseldorf".

58:03.653 --> 58:05.186
Did I play at Dusseldorf?

58:05.188 --> 58:08.423
It's not what it looks like.
I can explain.

58:08.425 --> 58:12.161
That's me and my high school
chess club.

58:12.163 --> 58:14.429
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:14.431 --> 58:16.865
I can explain this to you.
I know this looks weird.

58:18.469 --> 58:20.034
Remember the review
on the website?

58:20.036 --> 58:22.037
And the guy... it was a really
over-the-top review,

58:22.039 --> 58:23.972
and you called him
like a sad-sack blogger.

58:23.974 --> 58:26.842
- Oh, Duncan-something?
- Yes! God.

58:26.844 --> 58:30.211
Oh, my God, if he knew
that you knew his name...

58:30.213 --> 58:33.949
So, that guy is the guy.

58:33.951 --> 58:36.017
- Oh, that's your 15 years of...
- Yes!

58:36.019 --> 58:37.753
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:37.755 --> 58:40.121
Yeah, yeah. Bingo.
That's it. That's it.

58:40.123 --> 58:43.157
And this is his room...
shrine...

58:43.159 --> 58:46.662
temple where he lives
and worships you.

58:46.664 --> 58:47.829
Wow. Me and him.

58:47.831 --> 58:49.498
- Yes.
- Together forever.

58:49.500 --> 58:51.566
The reason I heard of you
is because of him.

58:51.568 --> 58:54.635
So, what better way
to get back at your ex than...?

58:54.637 --> 58:55.938
No, no.

58:55.940 --> 58:57.706
...get me back here,

58:57.708 --> 59:00.608
parade me around Sandcliff
like a trophy, right?

59:00.610 --> 59:02.577
I'm feeling a little cheap.
I'm feeling a little used.

59:02.579 --> 59:04.612
- I am.
- That's an interesting theory.

59:04.614 --> 59:07.148
And I appreciate
why you would think that.

59:07.150 --> 59:10.052
But it was your idea
to come here in the first place.

59:10.054 --> 59:11.889
- That's true.
- Yeah.

59:13.690 --> 59:16.157
I don't feel this way
about you at all.

59:16.159 --> 59:18.659
I've been down here like twice
in the last five years.

59:18.661 --> 59:20.662
I'm not trying to trap you

59:20.664 --> 59:25.032
or, like cut your head off,
or whatever.

59:27.771 --> 59:29.637
<i>I can't be
at the phone right now,</i>

59:29.639 --> 59:31.807
<i>so just leave a message.</i>

59:31.809 --> 59:33.208
Duncan, it's me.
Can you call me, please?

59:33.210 --> 59:34.642
It's very important.

59:34.644 --> 59:36.480
Call me back.

59:44.889 --> 59:46.621
Oh, shit.

59:46.623 --> 59:48.956
- Uh-oh, shit.
- What's up?

59:48.958 --> 59:50.726
Annie's down at the beach.

59:50.728 --> 59:52.827
Shit.

59:52.829 --> 59:55.264
Yeah, she saw me.
I better go down.

59:55.266 --> 59:57.699
If I blank her
she'll be devastated.

59:57.701 --> 59:59.570
I'll be right back, okay?

01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:07.842
Annie!

01:00:07.844 --> 01:00:09.278
Shit.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.780
Annie!

01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:14.316
- Hey.
- Did you get my message?

01:00:14.318 --> 01:00:16.584
I've been trying to call you.
I need to tell you something.

01:00:16.586 --> 01:00:18.153
- I wanted to chat to...
- How've you been?

01:00:18.155 --> 01:00:19.688
- Good.
- You look...

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:21.255
I wanted to tell you
something...

01:00:21.257 --> 01:00:22.925
- You look well.
- I really needed to talk to you

01:00:22.927 --> 01:00:24.592
about something,
that's why I was reaching out.

01:00:24.594 --> 01:00:26.228
I've taken up
exercising.

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:27.896
FitBit. Started with jogging...

01:00:27.898 --> 01:00:30.865
Do you remember that review
I wrote?

01:00:30.867 --> 01:00:32.233
Oh...

01:00:32.235 --> 01:00:33.702
Yeah.

01:00:33.704 --> 01:00:35.871
- I overreacted, Annie.
- No.

01:00:35.873 --> 01:00:37.838
- Not my finest hour.
- A couple of days after that.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:40.108
- It was the strangest thing...
- You weren't totally wrong,

01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:41.876
by the way.

01:00:41.878 --> 01:00:43.711
There was a lot of negativity
in what you said,

01:00:43.713 --> 01:00:45.112
but there was things
that were...

01:00:45.114 --> 01:00:46.615
"Twentieth Call of the Day"
is maudlin.

01:00:46.617 --> 01:00:48.249
- I realize that.
- Doesn't matter.

01:00:48.251 --> 01:00:50.084
The strangest sequence
of events started after that.

01:00:50.086 --> 01:00:52.019
Who's this?
You have a man with you, Annie.

01:00:52.021 --> 01:00:54.789
I've been trying to tell you,
what I want to talk about.

01:00:54.791 --> 01:00:56.191
- It's fine.
- That's him. It was so strange.

01:00:56.193 --> 01:00:58.594
Hi there.
Lovely day for the beach.

01:00:58.596 --> 01:01:01.095
- Fuck!
- What? Everything all right?

01:01:01.097 --> 01:01:02.998
- Yeah. I just...
- You're a friend of Annie's?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.800
Yeah.

01:01:04.802 --> 01:01:07.369
Making some sandcastles
with your little boy?

01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:10.171
- This is Duncan.
- It was bound to happen. Fine.

01:01:10.173 --> 01:01:13.675
- We were going to run in...
- Gina's here, so...

01:01:13.677 --> 01:01:16.144
- This is Duncan.
- Duncan Thomson.

01:01:16.146 --> 01:01:18.182
Tucker Crowe.

01:01:21.318 --> 01:01:24.286
That's what I was trying
to tell you.

01:01:24.288 --> 01:01:26.188
I'm Stevie fucking Wonder.

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:28.023
- Let's take it easy.
- Who do you want to be?

01:01:28.025 --> 01:01:30.191
Eartha fucking Kitt?
We're all somebody.

01:01:30.193 --> 01:01:32.360
- Hey.
- Just take it easy.

01:01:32.362 --> 01:01:34.128
- Real mature.
- I was trying to tell you.

01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:36.164
Well, Gina's waiting,
so I better...

01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:39.400
I was trying to explain
it to you before you were...

01:01:39.402 --> 01:01:42.304
- Gina!
- I was...

01:01:42.306 --> 01:01:44.576
- Wow!
- I was trying to...

01:01:49.079 --> 01:01:51.713
If she wants to make a sad
spectacle of herself around town

01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:54.316
by hanging out with some guy
old enough to be her father,

01:01:54.318 --> 01:01:55.950
that's her business.

01:01:55.952 --> 01:01:58.787
But mocking me by dragging
Tucker into it

01:01:58.789 --> 01:02:00.287
is just embarrassing.

01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:03.258
She was obviously just trying
to wind you up.

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.327
I know for a fact
that there is no son.

01:02:06.329 --> 01:02:08.295
There were rumors of a daughter
with a Swedish princess

01:02:08.297 --> 01:02:10.766
or potentially her cousin,

01:02:10.768 --> 01:02:13.200
but there's zero online chatter
of a son.

01:02:13.202 --> 01:02:14.970
- Did it look like Tucker Crowe?
- No.

01:02:14.972 --> 01:02:17.307
God no.

01:02:28.018 --> 01:02:29.653
Not entirely.

01:02:32.356 --> 01:02:34.292
Fuck.

01:02:36.193 --> 01:02:37.425
I'm going to have a shower.

01:02:37.427 --> 01:02:38.693
Shit!

01:02:38.695 --> 01:02:41.262

01:02:41.264 --> 01:02:46.802

Thus did the plague rage in
Avignon for six or eight weeks,

01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:10.157
and the breath of the sick,
who expectorated blood..."

01:03:10.159 --> 01:03:12.860
- I'm not sure about this.
- Come on.

01:03:12.862 --> 01:03:15.130
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:03:15.132 --> 01:03:17.865
Are you enjoying it?

01:03:17.867 --> 01:03:19.434
"It was not till towards
the close of the plague

01:03:19.436 --> 01:03:21.202
that they ventured to open,
by incision,

01:03:21.204 --> 01:03:23.204
these hard and dry boils.

01:03:23.206 --> 01:03:24.805
When matter flowed from them..."

01:03:24.807 --> 01:03:26.173
I think that's enough.

01:03:26.175 --> 01:03:28.142
- What are boils?
- It's a type of pimple...

01:03:28.144 --> 01:03:30.479
Hey, buddy, don't worry
about boils, okay?

01:03:30.481 --> 01:03:32.813
Out by the couch we got a wet
bag with some seashells in it,

01:03:32.815 --> 01:03:34.516
and then we get the paints
and we'll paint them.

01:03:34.518 --> 01:03:36.753
- Sound good?
- Fine.

01:03:39.088 --> 01:03:41.155
I'm so sorry.

01:03:41.157 --> 01:03:44.425
I really don't have anything,
like, fun for kids in the house.

01:03:44.427 --> 01:03:45.994
You're great with him.

01:03:45.996 --> 01:03:48.965
What about just having one
by yourself?

01:03:50.166 --> 01:03:51.833
I wouldn't know where to start.

01:03:51.835 --> 01:03:55.202
I think you could figure out
where to start.

01:03:55.204 --> 01:03:56.905
Yeah.

01:03:56.907 --> 01:03:58.539
Mr. Family Planner.

01:03:58.541 --> 01:04:02.510
Yeah, you probably shouldn't
take advice from me.

01:04:02.512 --> 01:04:05.949
Can I ask you,
what's the deal with Grace?

01:04:07.416 --> 01:04:09.217
What do you mean?

01:04:09.219 --> 01:04:11.253
Why does her name bother you
and the others don't?

01:04:11.255 --> 01:04:12.554
It doesn't bother me.

01:04:12.556 --> 01:04:14.222
I...

01:04:14.224 --> 01:04:15.956
I've never even met her.

01:04:15.958 --> 01:04:17.892
How's that possible?

01:04:17.894 --> 01:04:19.961
Well, there's something there.

01:04:19.963 --> 01:04:22.396
- You're ducking the question.
- No, no, no, I'm not.

01:04:22.398 --> 01:04:25.202
There's someone behind you,
out the window.

01:04:29.306 --> 01:04:31.208
Oh, my God.

01:04:39.483 --> 01:04:41.853
Would you like to come in?

01:04:43.519 --> 01:04:45.889
Yes, please.

01:04:46.923 --> 01:04:48.356
Hello again.

01:04:48.358 --> 01:04:50.327
Hey, there.

01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:58.200
There is a possibility that
maybe I owe you an apology.

01:04:58.202 --> 01:05:00.001
Well, when will you know
for sure?

01:05:01.905 --> 01:05:05.173
It occurs to me
that there's no reason

01:05:05.175 --> 01:05:07.208
for you to claim that you are...

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:10.845
he if you were not...

01:05:10.847 --> 01:05:12.613
he.

01:05:12.615 --> 01:05:14.548
- Well, that's a start.
- It's just...

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:17.351
I can't be certain,
you know?

01:05:17.353 --> 01:05:19.521
Well, I have a passport.

01:05:19.523 --> 01:05:21.425
Well, that would be super.

01:05:24.961 --> 01:05:26.463
Okay, um...

01:05:32.302 --> 01:05:34.338
America.

01:05:42.945 --> 01:05:44.382
Really?

01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:47.414
Yes, well, all of this seems
to be in order.

01:05:47.416 --> 01:05:49.150
- Oh, thank God.
- Duncan...

01:05:49.152 --> 01:05:53.954
That sounded... that sounded
a little officious.

01:05:53.956 --> 01:05:56.258
Why don't you come
and join us for dinner?

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.092
- Yeah, man. Join us.
- Hang out.

01:05:58.094 --> 01:06:00.561
Yeah. Yeah.
I'd like that.

01:06:00.563 --> 01:06:02.396
Great.

01:06:02.398 --> 01:06:05.032
So, for instance,
I'm developing a course

01:06:05.034 --> 01:06:07.068
on 1970's independent
American cinema,

01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:09.037
and the novels
of Nathanael West.

01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:11.106
<i>The Day of the Locust,
Miss Lonelyhearts.</i> I love that.

01:06:11.108 --> 01:06:12.539
That's right. Yeah.

01:06:12.541 --> 01:06:14.508
So, what brings you to England,
young man?

01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:16.378
My sister had a baby.

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.912
Oh!

01:06:17.914 --> 01:06:21.349
Well, congratulations, Unc.

01:06:21.351 --> 01:06:23.318
- Any other sisters or brothers?
- Duncan.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.686
- It's fine. It's fine.
- What?

01:06:25.688 --> 01:06:27.956
- It's okay. Tell him.
- Three.

01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:30.057
Or do I have four?

01:06:30.059 --> 01:06:31.927
I have four, right?

01:06:31.929 --> 01:06:34.496
They don't live with me.
They have different moms.

01:06:34.498 --> 01:06:37.965
And not one of them is a member
of the Swedish royal family.

01:06:39.101 --> 01:06:40.601
Yeah, no. I was...

01:06:40.603 --> 01:06:43.237
I was skeptical about that
particular theory.

01:06:43.239 --> 01:06:44.539
The exhibition's
coming along nicely.

01:06:44.541 --> 01:06:46.173
- That's great.
- Yeah.

01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:47.641
- You nervous?
- A little bit.

01:06:47.643 --> 01:06:49.276
I'm sure Annie's told you,

01:06:49.278 --> 01:06:51.045
but I am a great admirer
of your work, so...

01:06:51.047 --> 01:06:53.048
- Cool.
- Opening's Tuesday night.

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:55.182
- You're all invited.
- I don't think that I would be

01:06:55.184 --> 01:06:56.650
overstating the case to suggest

01:06:56.652 --> 01:06:58.586
that I am something
of a world expert.

01:07:01.123 --> 01:07:03.124
A world expert?

01:07:03.126 --> 01:07:05.363
I've read your stuff.
It's...

01:07:06.362 --> 01:07:07.662
Okay.

01:07:07.664 --> 01:07:09.264
Wow.

01:07:09.266 --> 01:07:11.499
You can tell me
where I've gone wrong.

01:07:11.501 --> 01:07:14.601
I wouldn't know
where to start.

01:07:14.603 --> 01:07:16.371
I understand why you'd say that,

01:07:16.373 --> 01:07:18.440
but I do actually know
quite a lot about you.

01:07:18.442 --> 01:07:20.742
Really? Wow. Okay.

01:07:20.744 --> 01:07:22.443
- Let me think of something.
- You know what?

01:07:22.445 --> 01:07:24.079
You don't have to give
an example...

01:07:24.081 --> 01:07:25.512
I know, for example,

01:07:25.514 --> 01:07:29.050
that on the chorus
of "Lies You Breathe",

01:07:29.052 --> 01:07:30.517
that entire chorus was lifted

01:07:30.519 --> 01:07:32.287
from an answering machine
message left for Julie

01:07:32.289 --> 01:07:34.990
by her ex-boyfriend,
Michael Posey.

01:07:34.992 --> 01:07:36.458
I don't remember those lyrics,
so I don't know.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.659
It was during
your "honeymoon phase" of...

01:07:38.661 --> 01:07:41.295
♪ Fevered kisses
And dirty words ♪

01:07:41.297 --> 01:07:43.231
You don't have to sing.
He's just a fan.

01:07:43.233 --> 01:07:45.733
- He's harmless, I promise you.
- It's just, Michael Posey.

01:07:45.735 --> 01:07:48.702
- How would you...?
- Is it still raw?

01:07:48.704 --> 01:07:50.271
Is what still raw?

01:07:50.273 --> 01:07:53.041
The whole affair,
Julie Beatty.

01:07:53.043 --> 01:07:55.142
Duncan, just stop.
Come on, that's too personal.

01:07:55.144 --> 01:07:57.144
- Just a long time ago.
- It's too personal.

01:07:57.146 --> 01:07:58.612
- Is it? Okay, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, that's too far.

01:07:58.614 --> 01:08:00.347
- I'm sorry. You're right.
- Too far.

01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:02.483
I know the whole thing
left you shattered.

01:08:02.485 --> 01:08:05.720
And I just want you to know
that from that death

01:08:05.722 --> 01:08:09.090
was born a seminal masterwork.

01:08:09.092 --> 01:08:11.191
Oh, God, a masterwork?

01:08:11.193 --> 01:08:12.559
I don't use that word lightly,
sir.

01:08:12.561 --> 01:08:14.295
All right,
I was being really nice, okay?

01:08:14.297 --> 01:08:16.330
But it's clear
that you don't know shit.

01:08:16.332 --> 01:08:19.567
- I'm sorry.
- You have to agree to disagree.

01:08:19.569 --> 01:08:22.036
Hey, am a I fan?
Guilty as charged.

01:08:22.037 --> 01:08:23.638
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, yes.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.241
Am I a little overzealous
in my quest for the truth?

01:08:26.243 --> 01:08:30.411
Listen, man, if you can't
realize that <i>Juliet</i>

01:08:30.412 --> 01:08:31.578
is a piece of shit...

01:08:31.581 --> 01:08:32.746
- Don't say that.
- Yeah, it is.

01:08:32.747 --> 01:08:34.448
You don't mean that.

01:08:34.451 --> 01:08:36.384
You don't have any relationship
to the truth.

01:08:36.386 --> 01:08:38.652
I'm not the only one who thinks
that you are a genius.

01:08:38.654 --> 01:08:40.654
- A genius...
- Fine.

01:08:40.657 --> 01:08:44.792
Maybe my review of your demos
wasn't exactly correct,

01:08:44.795 --> 01:08:46.794
but that original album, Tucker?

01:08:46.796 --> 01:08:49.763
Do you have any idea
how much that touches us?

01:08:49.765 --> 01:08:52.500
How much that has meant to me
my whole life?

01:08:52.502 --> 01:08:54.402
- The honesty in your words...
- Would you stop!

01:08:54.404 --> 01:08:57.274
It's not worth the effort.

01:09:02.444 --> 01:09:04.180
It is to me.

01:09:06.182 --> 01:09:08.282
I'm going to go.
I'm going to...

01:09:08.283 --> 01:09:09.787
This feels like a mistake.

01:09:12.622 --> 01:09:14.522
Just one final thing.

01:09:14.524 --> 01:09:17.591
I think that people like you,
people with real talent,

01:09:17.594 --> 01:09:22.397
you don't value it because
it comes naturally to you.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:24.301
And we never value things
that we...

01:09:25.734 --> 01:09:27.669
that come easily.

01:09:27.671 --> 01:09:32.439
But I value that album more than
maybe anything I've ever heard.

01:09:32.442 --> 01:09:35.143
Not because it's perfect,

01:09:35.145 --> 01:09:36.777
but because of
what it means to me.

01:09:36.779 --> 01:09:40.180
Ultimately, I don't give a shit
what it means to you.

01:09:40.182 --> 01:09:42.483
Art isn't for the artist

01:09:42.484 --> 01:09:46.523
no more than water
is for the bloody plumber.

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:49.124
But, thank you.

01:09:49.126 --> 01:09:51.560
I really, really enjoyed it.

01:10:10.613 --> 01:10:14.415
Last time I played a show
I didn't even finish it.

01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:17.919
I was at this club
called The Pit,

01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:22.257
and in between sets
I went to the bathroom.

01:10:22.259 --> 01:10:26.760
And then my ex walks in
the door.

01:10:26.762 --> 01:10:28.830
Julie.

01:10:28.832 --> 01:10:30.835
She's holding this baby.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:34.468
And I...

01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:36.771
and I acted all confused,

01:10:36.773 --> 01:10:39.174
as if, after we broke up,
a million people hadn't called

01:10:39.176 --> 01:10:41.942
and told me that
she was pregnant, you know?

01:10:41.944 --> 01:10:44.245
As if her brother
hadn't cursed me out

01:10:44.247 --> 01:10:46.214
the day the child was born.

01:10:46.216 --> 01:10:49.483
But she... she held out
this little girl

01:10:49.485 --> 01:10:52.452
and said, you know,
"Don't you want to look at her?"

01:10:52.454 --> 01:10:53.955
Grace?

01:10:53.957 --> 01:10:55.522
Yeah.

01:10:55.524 --> 01:10:57.228
Grace.

01:10:59.895 --> 01:11:03.665
And I looked at her.

01:11:03.667 --> 01:11:05.900
And then Julie said something,
you know, that I didn't hear.

01:11:05.902 --> 01:11:08.236
<i>Like, she said...
she said something to me</i>

01:11:08.238 --> 01:11:09.469
<i>about the baby bottle,</i>

01:11:09.471 --> 01:11:11.673
or she forgot her bag
or something.

01:11:11.675 --> 01:11:14.909
I thought that she was
abandoning the child with me.

01:11:14.911 --> 01:11:17.512
You know?
And I just panicked.

01:11:17.514 --> 01:11:21.249
And I wanted to follow
after her, but I...

01:11:21.251 --> 01:11:24.919
I didn't think that I could walk
out of this club with this baby.

01:11:24.921 --> 01:11:28.225
<i>There's all these people
out there.</i>

01:11:30.359 --> 01:11:32.559
So, I...

01:11:32.561 --> 01:11:34.797
I set Grace down.

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:43.271
And then I walked out.

01:11:43.273 --> 01:11:44.671
I went into the parking lot,

01:11:44.673 --> 01:11:46.641
and I could hear
everybody calling for me,

01:11:46.643 --> 01:11:48.311
but I...

01:11:49.546 --> 01:11:52.246
I didn't go back.

01:11:52.248 --> 01:11:54.949
And then I couldn't play any of
those songs anymore, you know?

01:11:54.951 --> 01:11:56.817
After that, I just...

01:11:56.819 --> 01:12:00.487
I couldn't play these insipid,
self-pitying songs

01:12:00.489 --> 01:12:03.357
about Julie
breaking my heart.

01:12:03.359 --> 01:12:06.794
You know,
they were a joke.

01:12:06.796 --> 01:12:09.664
And before I know it,
a couple of decades have gone by

01:12:09.666 --> 01:12:11.936
and some doctor hands me...

01:12:13.002 --> 01:12:15.238
hands me Jackson.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.540
I hold him, you know,
and I look at him.

01:12:19.542 --> 01:12:23.343
And I know that this boy...

01:12:23.345 --> 01:12:25.780
is my last chance.

01:12:25.782 --> 01:12:27.415
That's a lot of pressure

01:12:27.417 --> 01:12:29.784
for one little guy.

01:12:29.786 --> 01:12:31.753
All the rest of them
hate me so much.

01:12:31.755 --> 01:12:33.321
- They don't hate you.
- Yeah, they do.

01:12:33.323 --> 01:12:35.055
- Yeah, they do.
- They're mad at you.

01:12:35.057 --> 01:12:37.728
They're angry.
There's a difference.

01:12:40.029 --> 01:12:42.899
Do you know what I would do
for a couple of angry kids?

01:13:03.353 --> 01:13:06.387
- <i>Uh, is this Grace?</i>
- <i>Speaking.</i>

01:13:06.389 --> 01:13:07.754
This is Tucker Crowe.

01:13:07.756 --> 01:13:10.090
<i>Okay.</i>

01:13:10.092 --> 01:13:11.925
<i>And this is regarding...?</i>

01:13:11.927 --> 01:13:17.464
Well, I think Lizzie
tracked you down, right?

01:13:17.466 --> 01:13:18.900
<i>Who?</i>

01:13:18.902 --> 01:13:20.768
My other daughter, Lizzie.

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:22.570
<i>Listen, I'm at work.</i>

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:26.107
<i>Is there a reason
for this call?</i>

01:13:26.109 --> 01:13:29.443
I'm sorry, did you not get a
call from a person named Lizzie?

01:13:29.445 --> 01:13:31.079
<i>I did.</i>

01:13:31.081 --> 01:13:34.382
Oh.

01:13:34.384 --> 01:13:37.617
Listen, I'm sorry for calling
you out of the blue but...

01:13:37.619 --> 01:13:40.556
<i>Look, as I said to her,
I have a father already.</i>

01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:45.125
Oh. Okay.
Yeah, right.

01:13:45.127 --> 01:13:46.863
No, I understand.

01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:51.566
It's just, when you say that,
do you mean...

01:13:51.568 --> 01:13:53.367
Do you mean biologically, or...?

01:13:53.369 --> 01:13:55.706
<i>I'm not sure of the distinction
you're making.</i>

01:13:58.507 --> 01:13:59.840
Yeah. Right.

01:13:59.842 --> 01:14:01.776
Yeah. Right. Right.

01:14:01.778 --> 01:14:03.777
<i>Whatever it is you're trying
to work out, good luck.</i>

01:14:03.779 --> 01:14:07.382
<i>But it's just not going
to involve me.</i>

01:14:07.384 --> 01:14:08.715
Yes.

01:14:08.717 --> 01:14:11.686
Absolutely.
I understand.

01:14:11.688 --> 01:14:13.657
Thank you.

This exhibit
was Mayor Barton's idea.

01:14:54.963 --> 01:14:56.531
Yeah, my concept, yeah.

01:14:56.533 --> 01:14:58.833
And I donated
the Stones poster.

01:14:58.835 --> 01:15:01.102
- Wow.
- Only Bill Wyman signed it.

01:15:01.104 --> 01:15:02.602
The others refused.

01:15:02.604 --> 01:15:03.937
Mick and Keith walked straight
past me.

01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:05.673
Bloody musicians.

01:15:05.675 --> 01:15:07.708
- Yeah, bloody musicians.
- They were probably stoned.

01:15:07.710 --> 01:15:09.509
Tucker's actually
a bloody musician.

01:15:09.511 --> 01:15:10.977
I'm retired.

01:15:10.979 --> 01:15:12.079
He's actually quite a big deal.

01:15:12.081 --> 01:15:13.580
In small circles.

01:15:13.582 --> 01:15:14.816
Have I heard of you?

01:15:14.818 --> 01:15:16.817
- Tucker Crowe.
- Tucker Crowe?

01:15:16.819 --> 01:15:18.518
- You have heard of him?
- No. Never.

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.521
But nonetheless,
it's an honor to meet you.

01:15:20.523 --> 01:15:22.757
What are you drinking,
Tucker Crowe? I'll get you one.

01:15:22.759 --> 01:15:24.925
Don't worry, I'm fine.
A glass of water.

01:15:24.927 --> 01:15:27.128
I'm not getting a famous
American star a glass of water.

01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:28.963
- Red or white?
- Look, I'm not famous, okay?

01:15:28.965 --> 01:15:31.098
And I'm an alcoholic.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.835
Well, you'll fit right in.
I bet you'd love a beer.

01:15:33.837 --> 01:15:36.840
I bet you'd murder a cold beer.
I'll get you one.

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:42.809
- I'm going to get you a water.
- Appreciate it.

01:15:42.811 --> 01:15:44.711
No, no, no, this is incredible.

01:15:44.713 --> 01:15:46.613
Annie, can I borrow you
for a second?

01:15:46.615 --> 01:15:47.815
Are you okay?

01:15:47.817 --> 01:15:49.153
Mm-hmm.

01:15:57.993 --> 01:15:59.762
Hey, Annie.

01:16:03.832 --> 01:16:05.665
Edna, I want you
to meet Annie.

01:16:05.667 --> 01:16:08.768
And Annie,
I want you to meet Edna.

01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:12.240
Oh, my goodness,
is that really you?

01:16:12.242 --> 01:16:14.541
- Yes, that's me.
- Wow, I love this photo so much.

01:16:14.543 --> 01:16:17.812
- That's wild.
- That's my sister, Kathleen.

01:16:17.814 --> 01:16:21.048
- She's passed on now.
- Sorry.

01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:22.616
And the two fellas,

01:16:22.618 --> 01:16:24.652
we'd met them earlier on
in the summer.

01:16:24.654 --> 01:16:26.987
There's George. Mm.

01:16:26.989 --> 01:16:29.857
He was a fast worker.
He wanted a bit of fun.

01:16:29.859 --> 01:16:33.593
I wish I did too,
but I fought him off.

01:16:33.595 --> 01:16:38.031
I thought, Edna, you can never
go wrong not doing something.

01:16:38.033 --> 01:16:40.970
It's things that you do
that get you into trouble.

01:16:42.538 --> 01:16:44.104
Here I am, 84 years old,

01:16:44.106 --> 01:16:46.773
I've never been in trouble
in my whole bloody life.

01:16:46.775 --> 01:16:49.210
Goddamn it.

01:16:49.212 --> 01:16:51.312
Oh, well.

01:16:51.314 --> 01:16:53.313
It's a lovely exhibition.

01:16:53.315 --> 01:16:55.051
Thanks.

01:17:00.789 --> 01:17:04.125
Tucker, I was...
Oh, don't worry.

01:17:04.127 --> 01:17:07.061
- It's silly.
- What is it? What?

01:17:07.063 --> 01:17:09.196
I was wondering
if you would be...

01:17:09.198 --> 01:17:11.732
if you'd be interested?

01:17:11.734 --> 01:17:13.601
What do you mean...?

01:17:13.603 --> 01:17:15.001
I'm sorry. In me.

01:17:15.003 --> 01:17:18.606
In you? In you?
What... how?

01:17:18.608 --> 01:17:20.610
Oh, I mean, I suppose...

01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:23.679
sexually.

01:17:26.748 --> 01:17:28.616
What do you mean?
Like, here? Like right now?

01:17:28.618 --> 01:17:30.351
Oh, no, no. I meant...

01:17:32.854 --> 01:17:34.754
...in the future, later.

01:17:34.756 --> 01:17:36.824
What? Yes, definitely.
I'm extremely interested.

01:17:36.826 --> 01:17:39.125
Great, because I just wanted to
broach the subject with you...

01:17:39.127 --> 01:17:40.894
I mean, for the record,

01:17:40.896 --> 01:17:43.630
I would have probably been
a little more assertive.

01:17:43.632 --> 01:17:45.766
My confidence has taken a hit,
you know, with the heart.

01:17:45.768 --> 01:17:47.067
Like, I'm not exactly sure...

01:17:47.069 --> 01:17:48.803
I don't want to be presumptuous,

01:17:48.805 --> 01:17:52.906
but I did look up that side
of things on the Internet.

01:17:52.908 --> 01:17:54.608
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:17:54.610 --> 01:17:56.143
What did it say?

01:17:56.145 --> 01:17:57.711
Do you get breathless going up
the stairs?

01:17:57.713 --> 01:17:59.679
- Not at all.
- I think the thing is,

01:17:59.681 --> 01:18:01.315
is I have to do
most of the work.

01:18:01.317 --> 01:18:03.284
Oh, that's the way
I've always done it.

01:18:03.286 --> 01:18:08.054
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to take a break

01:18:08.056 --> 01:18:11.759
from the prerecorded portion
of our musical journey

01:18:11.761 --> 01:18:13.760
back to 1964.

01:18:13.762 --> 01:18:17.031
Fortunately,
we have with us today

01:18:17.033 --> 01:18:20.835
one of the most famous
American recording artists

01:18:20.837 --> 01:18:22.870
from that era.

01:18:22.872 --> 01:18:24.205
He's come to Sandcliff

01:18:24.207 --> 01:18:27.241
especially to visit
our exhibition,

01:18:27.243 --> 01:18:29.977
and he's an alcoholic.

01:18:29.979 --> 01:18:31.845
- Join the club, mate.
- I'm so sorry.

01:18:31.847 --> 01:18:35.049
- I didn't put him up to this.
- A very great honor.

01:18:35.051 --> 01:18:37.151
Terry, this is really...
Tucker's not playing tonight.

01:18:37.153 --> 01:18:39.253
Well, you see,
the jukebox has conked out.

01:18:39.255 --> 01:18:40.888
Terry, this is not
what Tucker's here for.

01:18:40.890 --> 01:18:42.790
It's a great, great honor

01:18:42.792 --> 01:18:45.092
to introduce the multiple
Grammy Award-winning...

01:18:45.094 --> 01:18:47.027
No, he's not...

01:18:47.029 --> 01:18:50.665
...member of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

01:18:50.667 --> 01:18:51.932
Tucker Crew!

01:18:53.802 --> 01:18:55.669
Tucker Crowe, actually.

01:18:55.671 --> 01:18:57.071
I am so sorry.

01:18:57.073 --> 01:18:58.772
You don't have to do this,
by the way.

01:18:58.774 --> 01:19:01.310
I didn't put him up to it.
I'm so sorry.

01:19:04.313 --> 01:19:06.781
Is this on?

01:19:06.783 --> 01:19:08.816
Uh...

01:19:08.818 --> 01:19:10.820
Wow.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.121
Yeah.

01:19:15.123 --> 01:19:17.791
For those that care,
I haven't won any Grammys

01:19:17.793 --> 01:19:20.730
and I'm not in the Hall of Fame,
but I'll accept the...

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:29.736
I was in Waterloo Station the
other day with a friend of mine,

01:19:29.738 --> 01:19:33.808
and it made me think
of a song I love.

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:37.044
Hey, I didn't write it,
but I wish that I did.

01:19:42.284 --> 01:19:43.817

01:22:19.274 --> 01:22:20.876
Daddy?

01:22:22.345 --> 01:22:24.245
Buddy, come on. Time for bed.

01:22:24.247 --> 01:22:26.950
I threw up on the couch.

01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:31.988
Okay, hold... hold on. Hold on.

01:22:39.028 --> 01:22:40.960
Oh, no.

01:22:40.962 --> 01:22:42.629
- Oh, you poor little thing.
- Okay, okay, what is it?

01:22:42.631 --> 01:22:45.031
Oh, jeez.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:22:45.033 --> 01:22:47.233
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.
Let's go.

01:22:47.235 --> 01:22:49.303
I'm so sorry.
What happened?

01:22:49.305 --> 01:22:51.004
Why don't you just...?

01:22:51.006 --> 01:22:52.842
Are you okay?

01:22:55.478 --> 01:22:57.577
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

01:22:57.579 --> 01:23:01.217
A clever cup of tea,
as my Dad would to say.

01:23:02.417 --> 01:23:04.220
Nice.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.086
Why is it clever?

01:23:07.088 --> 01:23:09.022
Because it can cure
anything.

01:23:09.024 --> 01:23:10.991
If you got a headache,
it goes straight to your head.

01:23:10.993 --> 01:23:14.495
If you got a stomachache,
goes straight to your stomach.

01:23:14.497 --> 01:23:17.397
What if you have
a heart attack?

01:23:17.399 --> 01:23:19.869
Goes straight
to your heart.

01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:26.973
When are we going home?

01:23:26.975 --> 01:23:29.078
Soon.

01:23:32.614 --> 01:23:34.483
Can I call Mom?

01:23:36.185 --> 01:23:38.184
You don't even
think it's worth a try?

01:23:38.186 --> 01:23:40.653
It's not like that, it's...
I really want to.

01:23:40.655 --> 01:23:42.121
You're breaking my heart.

01:23:42.123 --> 01:23:43.424
What were we even doing?

01:23:43.426 --> 01:23:45.058
We're just getting started.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.061
Jackson has to
be with his mother,

01:23:47.063 --> 01:23:49.196
- you have to be with Jackson.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

01:23:49.198 --> 01:23:51.965
It's been a wonderful
fantasy, but you're leaving here

01:23:51.967 --> 01:23:54.000
and everything's going to go
back to the way it was

01:23:54.002 --> 01:23:56.236

You slept with somebody else

01:29:02.911 --> 01:29:04.745
because she had the correct
response to an album.

01:29:04.747 --> 01:29:07.580

<i>♪ Well, I met her
At the bottom of a bottle ♪</i>

01:32:21.609 --> 01:32:25.978
<i>♪ There was simply
Nowhere lower left to go ♪</i>

01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:28.714
It's called <i>So Where Was I?</i>

01:32:28.716 --> 01:32:32.919
It's his first release
of new material in 25 years.

01:32:32.921 --> 01:32:34.888
What is my verdict?

01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:36.755
Well, to quote another critic:

01:32:36.757 --> 01:32:38.224
"What is this shite?"

01:32:38.226 --> 01:32:40.794
We have a song
about the pleasures

01:32:40.796 --> 01:32:43.062
of reading
in the afternoon.

01:32:43.064 --> 01:32:47.032
We have a song about
homegrown green beans.

01:32:47.034 --> 01:32:49.902
There's a little ditty
expounding the joys

01:32:49.904 --> 01:32:51.571
of being a stepfather.

01:32:51.573 --> 01:32:55.509
I mean, in short,
we have a tragedy.

01:32:55.511 --> 01:32:57.009
And there's a drum machine.

01:32:57.011 --> 01:32:59.778
There's a drum machine
on a Tucker Crowe album.

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:01.615
I mean, what the fuck?

01:33:01.617 --> 01:33:03.849
You may ask, as I did,

01:33:03.851 --> 01:33:07.754
what caused Tucker
to produce this cloying,

01:33:07.756 --> 01:33:09.889
bloodless, catastrophe?

01:33:09.891 --> 01:33:13.994
Well, reportedly,
Tucker has found love.

01:33:13.996 --> 01:33:16.263
And I am here to tell you,
my friends,

01:33:16.265 --> 01:33:18.734
it doesn't suit him.

01:33:18.736 --> 01:33:23.736
