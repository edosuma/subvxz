09:42.973 --> 09:43.887
No!

09:44.018 --> 09:46.107
See?
No puppy.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.239
What?
Wait, no puppy?

09:48.370 --> 09:49.980
No puppy.
[gasps]

09:50.111 --> 09:51.242
[gasps]

09:52.940 --> 09:54.985
Time to go!

09:57.422 --> 09:58.902
[barks]
Whoa!

09:59.033 --> 10:00.774
Ooh!
Huh?

10:00.904 --> 10:02.079
[car starting up]

10:03.254 --> 10:04.299
[puppy yipping]

10:04.429 --> 10:06.344
[gasps]

10:10.261 --> 10:12.655
[tires screeching]

10:15.266 --> 10:16.659
Lacey's house?

10:16.790 --> 10:18.574
Well, we need to find
this puppy's owner.

10:18.705 --> 10:21.316
That means asking
everyone in town.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.711
[doorbell ringing]

10:24.841 --> 10:26.147
[Sunny]
Hey, Lacey.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.539
We're looking for the owner
of this--

10:27.670 --> 10:30.847
Puppy!
So fluffy!

10:30.978 --> 10:34.546
[squealing]
Cute. Want her.

10:34.677 --> 10:37.158
But do you know
who her owner is?

10:37.288 --> 10:38.638
No, but finders keepers.

10:38.768 --> 10:39.726
[all]
Huh?

10:39.856 --> 10:41.466
Mine now, thank you,
come again.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.730
[confused bark,
chuckles nervously]

10:45.601 --> 10:48.082
Well, that did not go well.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.431
You know what?

10:49.561 --> 10:52.173
I don't think Fluffy
is Lacey's puppy.

10:52.303 --> 10:54.523
Me neither.
We need to get that puppy back.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.872
Follow me.

10:56.003 --> 10:58.309
Oh...
[giggles]

10:58.440 --> 10:59.310
[whimpering]

10:59.441 --> 11:01.312
Puppy...

11:02.574 --> 11:04.011
You don't need this,
do you, Kacey?

11:04.141 --> 11:05.055
[startled bark]

11:05.186 --> 11:08.189
I'll make you a proper bed.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.887
We can use some more
of Kacey's blankets.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.976
She doesn't need so many.

11:13.107 --> 11:15.892
And she's got plenty of toys
you can have.

11:16.023 --> 11:18.112
I'll just go find
everything we need.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.984
My blankets?

11:21.115 --> 11:22.594
My toys!

11:22.725 --> 11:24.858
[whimpering]Hey.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.866
[giggles]
Puppy...

11:32.996 --> 11:35.477
And I'll get some of Kacey's
doggy treats for you, too.

11:35.607 --> 11:40.177
[gasps]
My doggy treats?!

11:40.308 --> 11:43.877
Unacceptable!

11:44.007 --> 11:45.879

Hair ribbon... curlers...

11:49.665 --> 11:51.232
Sticky wax.

11:51.362 --> 11:54.365
Hmm... aha!
We'll need that bucket, too.

11:54.496 --> 11:55.410
Got it.

11:57.238 --> 11:58.369
What's the plan, Sunny?

11:58.500 --> 11:59.806
We're going
puppy fishing,

11:59.936 --> 12:01.633
through that sky light.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.897
We just need a great big
fishing rod,

12:04.027 --> 12:05.942
this bucket and...

12:06.073 --> 12:07.509
One of Doodle's
dog biscuits.

12:07.639 --> 12:09.946
One of my dog biscuits?
[inhales deeply]

12:10.077 --> 12:12.862
[sighs]
It's for a good cause.

12:14.255 --> 12:15.299
That's about right.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.959
[Sunny]
And a tight knot. One more.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.354
Perfect!

12:26.484 --> 12:27.921
Keep an eye out
for Lacey and Kacey.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.052
Got it.
Gotcha.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.413
Hmm...

12:43.545 --> 12:45.329
[doorbell rings]

12:46.896 --> 12:48.376
Scratch, the dog catcher?

12:48.506 --> 12:50.421
[growls]
He's not taking my puppy.

12:50.552 --> 12:53.773
A-a-ahem.
No one's here right now,

12:53.903 --> 12:56.819
but if you have a gift,
please leave it outside.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.081
Bye-bye.
Huh.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.909
Uh, okay.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.521
Huh?
Hang on.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.785
If there's no one there,

13:05.915 --> 13:09.310
who was that telling me
there's no one there?

13:09.440 --> 13:10.833
[doorbell rings]

13:10.964 --> 13:13.531
Ah!
So someone  is home.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.707
I'm looking
for a lost puppy.

13:15.838 --> 13:16.883
Woof!

13:17.013 --> 13:19.755
Ooh, come right this way.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.194
[confused yip]

13:24.325 --> 13:25.239
[sniffing]

13:27.763 --> 13:29.634
Ha!
Ha!
[giggles]

13:29.765 --> 13:32.768
Don't worry, Fluffy.
Just hang on tight.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.117
Woof?

13:34.248 --> 13:37.338
Hm.
Puppy, where are you?

13:37.468 --> 13:39.557
Um, all right, well,
maybe I should speak to Lacey

13:39.688 --> 13:41.037
about this, 'cause, um...

13:41.168 --> 13:44.867
Oh, no, no, no,
don't do that.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.826
[chuckles nervously]
She's...

13:46.956 --> 13:49.872
Scared! That's right.
Scared of puppies.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.179
And you're sure
you saw a puppy?

13:52.309 --> 13:54.224
Fluffy, tiny, cute.

13:54.355 --> 13:57.662
Steals blankets,
treats, affection?

13:57.793 --> 13:58.968
I've seen her.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.448
Okay.

14:05.670 --> 14:06.715
[confused yip]

14:07.934 --> 14:09.152
[grunting]

14:09.283 --> 14:12.503
Don't worry, Fluffy.
Just hang on tight.

14:12.634 --> 14:13.765
Uh...
[whimpering]

14:13.896 --> 14:17.247
She was here.
She was!

14:17.378 --> 14:20.903
Well, she's not here now.
She's nowhere to be seen!

14:21.034 --> 14:22.774
[puppy yips]
Huh?

14:22.905 --> 14:24.820

Ooh!
Huh?

14:26.082 --> 14:28.911
I must find that puppy.
I must.

Uh... what Puppy?

14:33.002 --> 14:35.613
[scoffs]
Hmm...

14:35.744 --> 14:39.574
If I see a puppy, any puppy,

14:39.704 --> 14:42.098
you'll be the first to know,
right, Kacey?

14:42.229 --> 14:43.752
[scoffs]

14:43.883 --> 14:46.320
Well, all right, then.
But you shouldn't go around

14:46.450 --> 14:48.148
saying you have puppies
when you don't.

she's got that puppy!

14:59.072 --> 15:02.466
Guess you're top dog
again, Kacey.
Hm!

15:07.167 --> 15:08.777
Poor Fluffy.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.301
She must be tired
after all that excitement.

15:11.432 --> 15:14.435
Who knew finding a puppy's
owner could be so hard?

15:14.565 --> 15:17.960
Hmm... maybe we should make
some flyers

15:18.091 --> 15:19.440
and post them around town.

Uh, Sunny?

We could draw a picture
of Fluffy with my color pen.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.104
Sunny?

15:31.234 --> 15:33.541
Ooh, and it could say
"puppy found!"

15:33.671 --> 15:35.978
Or "puppy lost!"

18:47.909 --> 18:50.303
[laughs]

18:50.433 --> 18:53.175
Thanks for always looking
after me, Sunny.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.873
[panting]
There you are.

18:56.004 --> 18:58.180
I won't let you take
Fluffy to the pound.

Oh...

19:02.532 --> 19:04.882
I was not expecting that.

19:05.013 --> 19:07.320
Looks like
she really likes you.

19:07.450 --> 19:10.540
I know.
I'm her owner!

19:10.671 --> 19:12.063
[all]
Owner?!

19:12.194 --> 19:14.283
So, you're not taking her
to the pound?

19:14.414 --> 19:15.632
Ahem!

19:15.763 --> 19:18.461
As official dogcatcher,
it is my duty

19:18.592 --> 19:20.594
to take dogs
without owners to the pound.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.205
But this little dog
has an owner.

19:23.336 --> 19:26.600
Me!
Isn't that right, Posie?

19:26.730 --> 19:28.210
Why is he calling
her Posie?

19:28.341 --> 19:29.516
Her name's Fluffy.

19:29.646 --> 19:32.127
I think she was called
Posie first.

19:32.258 --> 19:35.522
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

19:35.652 --> 19:38.525
You guys, I'm gonna make
Posie my assistant.

19:38.655 --> 19:41.484
She knows every hiding place
for runaway dogs,

19:41.615 --> 19:43.399
so there's no one
better to help me.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.532
Isn't that right?
Hmm.

19:45.662 --> 19:47.925
Well, if she's going
to be your assistant,

19:48.056 --> 19:49.927
she really needs
to look the part.

19:50.058 --> 19:52.582

your help for this.
