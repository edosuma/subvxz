WEBVTT

00:30.411 --> 00:33.606
Shadows chasin' time

00:33.706 --> 00:36.534
Chances slippin' by

00:37.001 --> 00:41.406
Thinkin' about what's right and wrong

00:41.506 --> 00:46.619
- Whoo
- Beyond the light of day

00:46.719 --> 00:49.039
There's no denyin'

00:49.139 --> 00:54.544
- One step is all it takes
- And you'll be playin'

00:54.644 --> 00:58.214
You've gotta trust your heart
when nothing's right

00:58.314 --> 01:01.217
And never let 'em know
you're runnin' scared inside

01:01.317 --> 01:04.763
You can chase that dream
a thousand miles

01:04.863 --> 01:09.851
As soon as you believe it
you can make it to the end of the line

01:09.951 --> 01:14.155
There's no more runnin' scared

01:19.752 --> 01:23.114
It's time to roll the dice

01:23.214 --> 01:26.618
And cut right through the ice

01:26.718 --> 01:30.830
Forget about the price we pay

01:30.930 --> 01:36.127
- And I'll tell you
- By the light of day

01:36.227 --> 01:38.338
There's no denyin'

01:38.438 --> 01:44.219
- One step is all it takes
- And you'll be playin'

01:44.319 --> 01:47.722
You've gotta trust your
heart when nothing's right

01:47.822 --> 01:50.934
And never let 'em know
you're runnin' scared inside

01:51.034 --> 01:54.354
You can chase that dream
a thousand miles

01:54.454 --> 01:59.701
As soon as you believe it
you can make it to the end of the line

02:00.877 --> 02:08.084
Tonight there's no more runnin' scared

02:26.194 --> 02:28.930
Shoot. Shoot. Shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot, shoot.

02:29.030 --> 02:32.475
They gotta shoot from outside.
They're cloggin' up the middle.

02:32.575 --> 02:37.355
This is terrific. I'm freezin' my ass off,
and I got Red Auerbach here.

02:37.455 --> 02:40.158
Stay out of the game.

02:44.254 --> 02:46.497
Give 'em the ball.

02:49.050 --> 02:51.786
- Hey. How about the ball?
- Yo. The ball. The ball.

02:51.886 --> 02:54.505
- Come on. Give us the ball.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:55.348 --> 02:57.667
Just give 'em back the ball.

02:57.767 --> 03:00.928
- You wanna play?
- The ball. Come on.

03:02.355 --> 03:04.474
- Hey!
- Come on, hey!

03:07.902 --> 03:10.605
Come on, shithead, give me the ball.

03:13.825 --> 03:17.854
- I don't want the damn ball.
- 20 seconds on the clock.

03:17.954 --> 03:20.281
Come on!

03:23.001 --> 03:25.779
We're playin' a game here.
Gimme the ball.

03:25.879 --> 03:28.990
- You're in for it now, man.
- Hey, just one second, you know?

03:29.090 --> 03:32.085
Come on. That's right.

03:32.677 --> 03:35.088
Don't put the hands on.

03:37.056 --> 03:40.585
And he gets his own rebound!
The crowd goin' nuts.

03:40.685 --> 03:43.721
He's a tough kid.
You can say that again, friends.

03:47.317 --> 03:49.052
Hey.

03:49.152 --> 03:52.472
- You belted him, you shithead!
- Let it go. It's all right.

03:52.572 --> 03:56.017
No. It coulda been me he clobbered.
It sets a bad precedent.

03:56.117 --> 03:59.771
- Come on. No autopsy, no foul. Let's go.
- You're a lucky fella.

03:59.871 --> 04:02.649
Shut up, man. You got the
entire Sioux Nation here.

04:02.749 --> 04:05.610
They cut down the inside.
Why not take the outside shot?

04:05.710 --> 04:08.162
I got carried away.
Look at the Mercedes.

04:10.131 --> 04:12.325
That's Snake. Who's drivin'?

04:12.425 --> 04:15.704
- I don't know. Let's bust him.
- For what?

04:15.804 --> 04:19.040
In this neighbourhood a
Mercedes is probable cause.

04:19.140 --> 04:23.503
- That's Julio Gonzales.
- Hey, didn't we just put him away?

04:23.603 --> 04:28.182
Get in the car, Snake. Quick,
give me the briefcase. Get in the car.

04:32.987 --> 04:36.858
- It's three years. Maybe he's on parole.
- In a Mercedes?

04:52.173 --> 04:55.752
How come these losers never
live on the ground floor?

05:00.640 --> 05:03.126
- Snake, man, my foot!
- What do you want?

05:03.226 --> 05:07.847
- Let's begin with my foot.
- Here's the situation. I have this gun here.

05:07.981 --> 05:12.469
I'm gonna take the gun out, and I'm
gonna shoot a lot of holes in the door.

05:12.569 --> 05:16.097
If you are standing in front of
the door, what can I tell you?

05:16.197 --> 05:18.725
Some of those holes are gonna be in you.

05:18.825 --> 05:21.527
You catching my drift, Snake?

05:27.041 --> 05:30.403
- You got nothin' on me.
- Assaulting an officer's foot?

05:30.503 --> 05:33.740
We heard you were back.
We came to renew your pusher's licence.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.577
Not me. I'm clean as a baby's ass.
I've been born again.

05:37.677 --> 05:41.373
- Right. What's in the briefcase, Snake?
- Nothin'. Just stuff.

05:41.473 --> 05:44.626
- Stuff? That's clever.
- Yeah. Personal shit.

05:44.726 --> 05:47.921
Personal? Like what? Your memoirs?
Your prom pictures?

05:48.021 --> 05:51.132
- The first one. My memories.
- Could you be dumber?

05:51.232 --> 05:53.643
Can we take a look inside?

05:56.237 --> 05:59.265
- You got a search warrant?
- We can get one.

05:59.365 --> 06:01.893
You wanna be uncomfortable
all that time?

06:01.993 --> 06:04.862
And we're talkin' real uncomfortable.

06:11.085 --> 06:13.329
Holy shit.

06:15.131 --> 06:17.659
Ain't no law against havin' money.

06:17.759 --> 06:22.539
Snake, now I want you to level with us.
Is it possible you're dealing again?

06:22.639 --> 06:23.998
Nah!

06:24.098 --> 06:27.544
Snake, we gotta take the place apart.
You understand?

06:27.644 --> 06:31.848
Go ahead. See if I care.

06:33.441 --> 06:37.687
- There's $50,000 here.
- You know what I could do with $50,000?

06:37.987 --> 06:41.099
I told you I was clean.
You wouldn't be prosecutin' me...

06:41.199 --> 06:45.478
if I wore silk suits and lived on the
Gold Coast. This is harassment.

06:45.578 --> 06:48.773
How'd you get the name Snake?
What, you got a long wee-wee?

06:48.873 --> 06:50.900
Sorry, man, but we gotta bust you.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.446
- You ain't got no reason to bust me.
- We got 50,000 reasons.

06:54.546 --> 06:57.623
Right. But you ain't got no crime.

07:03.096 --> 07:04.380
I will be back.

07:04.764 --> 07:07.208
Yo! Hey!

07:07.308 --> 07:11.262
Yo. Hey. Yo! Can I have
your attention, please?

07:11.855 --> 07:15.050
- This is a neighbourhood watch area.
- What's he doin'?

07:15.150 --> 07:18.887
- Rich people make him crazy.
- There's a guy up here named Snake.

07:18.987 --> 07:23.183
He's wearin' garage-sale clothes and
the top of his hair looks like a parakeet.

07:23.283 --> 07:28.404
He also has $50,000 in
small bills in a briefcase.

07:28.663 --> 07:34.152
As his neighbours, you must make sure
there are no suspicious characters...

07:34.252 --> 07:38.698
or evil perpetrators lurkin' in the
area who would seek to do him harm.

07:38.798 --> 07:43.453
Again, $50,000 in small bills. Tax free!

07:43.553 --> 07:47.290
In a briefcase, in this apartment,
which has really cheeseball locks.

07:47.390 --> 07:50.919
You can push in, bop him on
the head, take it... Nobody'll know.

07:51.019 --> 07:54.138
So it's up to you.
Thanks a lot. Have a good day.

07:58.151 --> 08:00.220
- Well said.
- You can't do that.

08:00.320 --> 08:04.849
Yes, he can. What he can't do is undo it.
So, good luck at your chosen profession.

08:04.949 --> 08:08.395
Yeah. Keep in touch, man.
Don't be a stranger.

08:08.495 --> 08:10.738
Wait. Wait!

08:12.957 --> 08:16.277
- You can't leave me here now.
- Sorry, Snake, but you're clean.

08:16.377 --> 08:18.621
- You gotta arrest my ass.
- For what?

08:24.219 --> 08:25.503
Thanks very much.

08:32.684 --> 08:35.547
- Mr Hughes.
- Come on, man, come on. It's cold here.

08:35.647 --> 08:37.890
Relax, Snake.

08:46.658 --> 08:49.602
Saw Gonzales in a Mercedes.
Who's he workin' for?

08:49.702 --> 08:51.688
Julio don't work for nobody.

08:51.788 --> 08:55.066
His boss had an accident.
He fell on a knife four times.

08:55.166 --> 08:57.736
- Those things do happen.
- It's a jungle out there.

08:57.836 --> 09:02.574
Listen, you dimball, we got $50,000.
Think Gonzales was buyin' Savings Bonds?

09:02.674 --> 09:06.703
Yeah, right. Yeah. Buy American.
Support your country. Shit like that.

09:06.803 --> 09:11.750
- Could he be, maybe, importing cocaine?
- No, no, no. That would be illegal.

09:11.850 --> 09:15.762
Hey. I got the right to
remain silent. Listen to this.

09:19.399 --> 09:23.553
I hate the fact that Gonzales has a
Mercedes and we're in this tub of crap.

09:23.653 --> 09:26.064
Yeah, it does lack a certain style.

09:27.198 --> 09:28.975
- You know what?
- What?

09:29.075 --> 09:32.771
Why don't we go to where Gonzales
lives and find out where he shops?

09:32.871 --> 09:35.648
If he can afford a Mercedes,
maybe we can too.

09:35.748 --> 09:38.693
But, now, where are we
gonna find $50,000?

09:38.793 --> 09:41.287
I don't know.

09:48.595 --> 09:52.715
If I were Gonzales, this is not
where I would park my Mercedes.

09:56.269 --> 09:58.838
- How you doin'?
- All right. Where's the fire?

09:58.938 --> 10:04.094
There is no fire. A jumper hit the sidewalk.
They hate cops here, so they call us.

10:04.194 --> 10:06.679
I don't know why they
can't call Chicken Delight.

10:06.779 --> 10:09.057
All right. I love fires.

10:09.157 --> 10:11.401
Yeah?

10:13.411 --> 10:15.855
Hey, man. What are you doin'?

10:15.955 --> 10:18.900
I'll take this so you don't
make any bad investments.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.694
That's my money! Hey, you!

10:21.794 --> 10:24.747
Hey, man! You be careful with that!

10:25.673 --> 10:27.917
- Watch the hose.
- OK.

10:31.888 --> 10:33.957
- Well, look who's here.
- Hey, Garcia.

10:34.057 --> 10:35.792
My favourite traffic cop.

10:35.892 --> 10:38.044
- You give the body a ticket yet?
- Up yours.

10:38.144 --> 10:41.673
- Fellas, fellas.
- Gruesome stuff. Does the lump have ID?

10:41.773 --> 10:45.635
Nothin'. Not even a face.
John Doe meets Sheraton Road. Splat.

10:45.735 --> 10:49.814
- Anybody see anything?
- Not around here. Nobody saw nothin'.

10:49.989 --> 10:53.226
Nobody saw nothing? You mean
somebody got up on the roof...

10:53.326 --> 10:56.312
and said "Anybody looks,
I'm not jumping"? Come on.

10:56.412 --> 11:01.067
Hey. You two weren't "questioning
a suspect" on the roof, were you?

11:01.167 --> 11:04.154
That's cute. Go put your
nuts in a microwave.

11:04.254 --> 11:07.699
- He jumped barefoot?
- Locals musta stole his shoes.

11:07.799 --> 11:12.579
- His clothes are wet. Did they bathe him?
- The guy checked out. It's no big deal.

11:12.679 --> 11:16.249
- Are you tryin' to drum up business?
- No, to arrest Julio Gonzales.

11:16.349 --> 11:19.711
- If this is him, it would save a lotta grief.
- He's not around.

11:19.811 --> 11:22.213
When he got out of Joliet, he had money.

11:22.313 --> 11:25.800
Moved downtown for his new image.
Wants to be the next Al Capone.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.887
- We gotta get this guy fast, man.
- Hey, what time is it?

11:28.987 --> 11:32.891
- Ten to four.
- I gotta go say goodbye to Aunt Rose.

11:32.991 --> 11:37.653
Callin' all cars. Callin' all cars!
UFO landed on Michigan Avenue.

11:43.376 --> 11:45.570
I should park inconspicuously.

11:45.670 --> 11:49.157
What is this? Don't pull
that psycho cop shit on me.

11:49.257 --> 11:54.003
This is my Aunt Rose's funeral.
One wisecrack gets you your own casket.

11:57.056 --> 12:00.343
- Leave me in the car. I don't want to go.
- Come on.

12:01.728 --> 12:04.047
- What are we doing?
- Shut up and look sad.

12:04.147 --> 12:08.885
- I can't go to no funeral dressed like this.
- I'll get you a shovel. You'll fit right in.

12:08.985 --> 12:13.056
Through the Holy Spirit, as it was at
the beginning, is now and ever shall be...

12:13.156 --> 12:15.308
world without end. Amen.

12:15.408 --> 12:18.478
May her soul, and all the souls
of the faithful departed...

12:18.578 --> 12:21.606
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

12:21.706 --> 12:23.950
Amen.

12:33.968 --> 12:36.830
- Hello, Danny.
- Hi, Anna. It's nice of you to come.

12:36.930 --> 12:39.416
I liked her a lot.

12:39.516 --> 12:42.711
- Hey. Hi, Ray.
- Hi, Anna.

12:42.811 --> 12:45.046
- Lookin' good.
- Thanks.

12:45.146 --> 12:48.266
It's good to see you two
back together again.

12:48.483 --> 12:52.137
- We're still divorced.
- Italians don't get divorced. It's a sin.

12:52.237 --> 12:55.557
- They're just not together.
- We're still not together.

12:55.657 --> 12:58.977
- Good. He's no good for you.
- Aunt Sophie, what do you mean?

12:59.077 --> 13:02.355
Look at you. You don't even bother
to wear a tie, much less a suit.

13:02.455 --> 13:04.524
I was working. Rose would understand.

13:04.624 --> 13:07.944
- God knows why she was so fond of you.
- It's a mystery to me too.

13:08.044 --> 13:10.780
- But I was her favourite nephew.
- Her only nephew.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.992
Mine too, but I expect you'll
be on time for my funeral.

13:14.092 --> 13:16.294
I will be the first one on line.

13:17.095 --> 13:20.040
And you. You don't look
much better than him.

13:20.140 --> 13:23.543
- Hi, Aunt Sophie.
- I'm not your aunt. Nor yours, neither.

13:23.643 --> 13:27.055
Father, you know Danny.
This is Detective Hughes.

13:28.898 --> 13:31.684
This is Mr Snake.
We sorta work together.

13:36.072 --> 13:39.233
- We'll talk later, huh?
- Yeah. Bye.

13:44.914 --> 13:48.193
As soon as we're outta sight,
I'll kick the shit outta you.

13:48.293 --> 13:50.737
- Anna sure is looking good.
- Who cares?

13:50.837 --> 13:53.573
- Sure is touchy about his ex-wife.
- She's a piece.

13:53.673 --> 13:56.159
- Don't talk about her, pig-breath.
- So touchy.

13:56.259 --> 13:58.495
- That's right.
- Costanzo, you let that go?

13:58.595 --> 14:00.914
- Shut up, Snake.
- Gimme your money!

14:01.014 --> 14:02.874
- What?
- You heard me.

14:02.974 --> 14:05.335
- Hey, man, don't shoot.
- You're mugging us?

14:05.435 --> 14:08.046
Believe it or you're dead.
Give us your money.

14:08.146 --> 14:10.965
- Take this. It's full of money.
- No, no. That's mine.

14:11.065 --> 14:14.010
Don't fuck with me.
We want your cash, not your luggage.

14:14.110 --> 14:17.472
- Take the cash, but we need the wallets.
- We want it all. Hurry.

14:17.572 --> 14:20.600
Come on. Let us keep the drivers'
licences and snapshots.

14:20.700 --> 14:23.853
- And our badges.
- Shit. Cops.

14:23.953 --> 14:29.234
Do you think we all wear uniforms and
drive cars that say "Police" on them?

14:29.334 --> 14:31.528
Look, see? I'm with you.

14:31.628 --> 14:34.864
- You're under arrest.
- You have the right to remain silent.

14:34.964 --> 14:37.784
Anything you say will be
used against you. You...

14:37.884 --> 14:42.205
- Gimme your guns, man.
- Take the cash. We gotta keep the guns.

14:42.305 --> 14:45.458
- I can't give guns to riffraff.
- The right to breakfast...

14:45.558 --> 14:49.003
- ...the right to a beverage of your choice...
- They've got guns.

14:49.103 --> 14:54.426
Fellas, this is just me, but I'd rather
get shot with one of those pissant.22s...

14:54.526 --> 14:56.978
than with my.38.

14:57.695 --> 15:01.808
- You're under arrest. Don't make it worse.
- Move again, I'll shoot your ass.

15:01.908 --> 15:05.270
Pointing a gun at a police officer?
Can we waste them for that?

15:05.370 --> 15:08.322
- I think so.
- Yeah.

15:09.666 --> 15:12.819
- It starts in the home.
- It's the educational system.

15:12.919 --> 15:16.031
- The new math drives them nuts.
- Right to the streets.

15:16.131 --> 15:19.125
- You ready?
- Yeah. Come on.

15:27.267 --> 15:29.552
Stop. Stop. Police.

16:01.384 --> 16:03.620
I can't believe you
missed all six shots.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.206
What? I hit the windshield
six times in a row.

16:06.306 --> 16:10.001
No, excuse me, sir. All six of mine hit.
I don't know where you were.

16:10.101 --> 16:14.255
- I'm the one that made 'em swerve.
- You did? You always aim low anyway!

16:14.355 --> 16:16.925
Oh, let's do height jokes?
That's really good.

16:17.025 --> 16:20.470
- You fuckers are sick.
- I just want credit where it's due.

16:20.570 --> 16:23.515
Snake, from here,
the angle of trajectory is...

16:23.615 --> 16:25.900
Great. Look who I'm talkin' to. Mr SATs.

16:26.284 --> 16:28.395
Costanzo, stop pickin' on me.

16:28.495 --> 16:33.191
- I know you're just doin' your job.
- I just want you to shut up for a minute.

16:33.291 --> 16:37.370
- So you saw 'em mop up the pancake?
- Hi, Captain.

16:39.297 --> 16:43.952
Very pretty. You weren't, by any chance,
"interrogating" anybody on that roof?

16:44.052 --> 16:47.622
We got an alibi. Snake, tell him
where we were or we'll kill you too.

16:47.722 --> 16:51.501
- Officer Raymond Hughes?
- Who wants to know?

16:51.601 --> 16:55.255
The days of brute law enforcement
are over. Welcome to the 1980s.

16:55.355 --> 16:58.683
I'm not Hughes,
and welcome to the 28th District.

17:00.443 --> 17:03.263
A subpoena for me? No, thank you.

17:03.363 --> 17:07.684
Officer Hughes, you're being sued for
abusing the rights of Hector Wallace.

17:07.784 --> 17:10.561
Hey, man. I'm one of the abused.

17:10.662 --> 17:12.905
I'm no cop.

17:21.673 --> 17:24.541
You a lawyer? Yo, let me have your card.

17:24.800 --> 17:28.663
- And the rights of the woman he killed?
- You get mugged, don't come to us!

17:28.763 --> 17:32.834
Another satisfied customer.
Our grateful public can't thank us enough.

17:32.934 --> 17:35.178
All right.

17:35.937 --> 17:40.892
Don't even think about puttin' my Cub
hat on that hair. Put that down.

17:46.823 --> 17:48.975
- Weren't you scared?
- I used to be.

17:49.075 --> 17:52.812
- But then I discovered I was bulletproof.
- I'm not bulletproof.

17:52.912 --> 17:55.482
- Ray always gets shot.
- That's awful.

17:55.582 --> 17:59.444
- It's just bullets.
- Little ones. I tend to be more cautious.

17:59.544 --> 18:03.656
- Cautious, my ass.
- Danny's the one who gets Ray shot.

18:03.756 --> 18:05.825
Some women like men with scars.

18:05.925 --> 18:10.121
You like scars? I have a lot of scars.
Deep, emotional scars.

18:10.221 --> 18:12.290
Danny's workin' on his next ex-wife.

18:12.390 --> 18:15.377
Would you marry me for a few days?
No strings attached.

18:15.477 --> 18:17.670
How could I resist an offer like that?

18:17.770 --> 18:20.006
- What's your name?
- Maryann.

18:20.106 --> 18:22.384
- Maryann what?
- Just Maryann.

18:22.484 --> 18:26.638
Just Maryann. No last name?
You're married. She's married.

18:26.738 --> 18:31.017
I'm not married. Not at the moment.
You're not looking for a wife, are you?

18:31.117 --> 18:33.937
- I already had one.
- I've already been one.

18:34.037 --> 18:36.489
We have a lot in common.

19:09.989 --> 19:13.351
- What's he doing here?
- I brought doughnuts.

19:13.451 --> 19:16.312
I was gonna get those French things,
but I hate the word.

19:16.412 --> 19:19.399
- Croissants?
- Boom. Say it wrong, you sound stupid.

19:19.499 --> 19:21.901
So I brought doughnuts.

19:22.001 --> 19:24.245
- So how was she?
- Well?

19:25.004 --> 19:27.874
She's friendly. I like her.

19:29.717 --> 19:31.995
I now know why you have an ex-wife.

19:32.095 --> 19:35.248
At least I don't have an ex-partner.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.717
I think your friend's jealous.

19:39.936 --> 19:42.180
Wow.

19:43.815 --> 19:47.518
Someday, we both have to
find women at the same time.

19:57.871 --> 19:59.939
She certainly was on top.

20:00.039 --> 20:02.450
Hi, good-lookin'. How you doin'?

20:04.794 --> 20:07.038
Can't live without me?

20:08.381 --> 20:11.743
- Don't start. This is hard enough already.
- Hey, Costanzo.

20:11.843 --> 20:14.087
You got a visitor.

20:15.263 --> 20:18.083
- I sent your cheque.
- I'm not here about alimony.

20:18.183 --> 20:21.544
- That's not your lawyer?
- No.

20:21.644 --> 20:25.473
Hey, Ray. Ray? Buy me some time?

20:28.193 --> 20:31.012
- Officer Costanzo?
- That's Costanzo over there.

20:31.112 --> 20:33.556
- But he didn't lay a hand on him.
- On who?

20:33.656 --> 20:35.900
Whoever.

20:40.538 --> 20:42.732
- So what's the problem?
- No problem.

20:42.832 --> 20:46.986
- I just wanted to see you for a minute.
- Well, here I am.

20:47.086 --> 20:50.615
- How've you been?
- Fine, great. How about you?

20:50.715 --> 20:52.534
I'm pretty good.

20:52.634 --> 20:56.004
- How's the social-work business?
- Busy.

20:56.971 --> 20:59.632
I'm getting married.

21:02.393 --> 21:04.721
- Do I know the guy?
- No.

21:05.980 --> 21:08.425
He's not in the stairs
or the men's room.

21:08.525 --> 21:10.727
Try the ladies' room.

21:13.822 --> 21:18.476
Well, that's great, Anna.
That's really great. I bet he's a stable guy.

21:18.576 --> 21:22.572
He's a nice man. And, yeah, he's stable.

21:23.998 --> 21:25.775
- A doctor?
- Kind of.

21:25.875 --> 21:28.695
- Kind of? What's kind of a doctor?
- He's a dentist.

21:28.795 --> 21:31.281
- No shit?
- No shit.

21:31.381 --> 21:35.418
- Do they play their office music at home?
- At least he's a grown-up.

21:46.771 --> 21:49.883
- You Costanzo?
- Come in, you're arrested for indecency.

21:49.983 --> 21:52.560
- Yourself?
- I'm on a stakeout.

21:53.987 --> 21:56.848
- You don't look like a Costanzo.
- Hey, I'm a paesano.

21:56.948 --> 21:59.851
What do you want me to do?
Cook you up a pot of ragù?

21:59.951 --> 22:04.856
Or sweat garlic for you? Sing an opera?
Lose a war? Va fare in culo.

22:04.956 --> 22:09.152
Hey, I'm not gonna hang around
all day just to give you this.

22:09.252 --> 22:12.864
- Who's it from this time?
- It's your Aunt Rose.

22:12.964 --> 22:17.160
- Don't joke about my Aunt Rose.
- You have my sincere condolences.

22:17.260 --> 22:19.954
Your aunt's entire estate
has not been computed...

22:20.054 --> 22:25.251
but our law firm estimates say,
after taxes, you'll receive about $40,000.

22:25.351 --> 22:28.046
- Dollars?!
- This visit has been a courtesy.

22:28.146 --> 22:32.558
If you want further details,
why don't you come by my office?

22:41.409 --> 22:43.820
Yes!

22:49.375 --> 22:52.495
- Hey. You're rich.
- Anna's gettin' married.

22:53.129 --> 22:55.949
Oh. I'm happy for you.
If you're happy for yourself.

22:56.049 --> 22:57.867
- To a dentist.
- No shit.

22:57.967 --> 23:02.247
He might not be Mr Excitement, but he'll
be there. I've had enough excitement.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.833
- They'll have clown paintings.
- That's cold.

23:04.933 --> 23:08.886
Don't make me laugh.
I don't wanna laugh. I gotta go.

23:10.522 --> 23:13.258
I'll talk to you later. Wish me well.

23:13.358 --> 23:16.477
I do. You know I do.

23:18.404 --> 23:21.182
- I bet his favourite flavour's Lavoris.

23:21.282 --> 23:24.602
- Who cares?
- Right.

23:24.702 --> 23:26.946
- It's no big deal, man.
- Right.

23:27.705 --> 23:30.908
- You know, I'm better off without her.
- Wrong.

23:31.584 --> 23:32.827
Did you say I was rich?

23:33.878 --> 23:36.865
We'll have dinner at the Pump Room.
With appetisers.

23:36.965 --> 23:39.617
Then I'll buy one of those
laser disc stereos...

23:39.717 --> 23:42.078
where the speakers are so
big I have to move out.

23:42.178 --> 23:45.123
Good seats for the Cub games.
I'll give you $10,000.

23:45.223 --> 23:48.752
I lied. If there's anything left,
I'll pay some bills.

23:48.852 --> 23:51.921
- Hey. The jumper yesterday?
- Yeah?

23:52.021 --> 23:55.925
- I just got the cause of death.
- Let me guess. Deceleration trauma?

23:56.025 --> 23:58.219
- Cement poisoning?
- He drowned.

23:58.319 --> 24:02.390
- Poor guy couldn't swim or fly?
- You don't need a cop, just a lifeguard.

24:02.490 --> 24:06.944
Victim's name is Alan Jackson.
He was a cop from the South Side.

24:08.371 --> 24:12.525
- Sorry, Captain. We'll get on it.
- What's he doin' in that neighbourhood?

24:12.625 --> 24:17.080
We do not know. You are
the detectives. Go and detect.

24:18.089 --> 24:20.333
All right?

24:24.137 --> 24:25.872
Gonzales is back in action...

24:25.972 --> 24:30.668
and suddenly there's a drowned cop
thrown off his apartment building?

24:30.768 --> 24:32.762
Let's go talk to Snake.

24:40.445 --> 24:43.564
Number five, would you
step forward, please?

24:46.868 --> 24:50.688
- That's him. That's the one.
- You have to be absolutely positive, sir.

24:50.788 --> 24:55.193
I am absolutely positive. Who could forget
that face? I saw it through the screen.

24:55.293 --> 24:57.153
Turn to the right, please.

24:57.253 --> 25:00.448
- Not you, sir. Number five.
- What the hell is this, man?

25:00.548 --> 25:03.042
Just do as you're told, number five.

25:05.386 --> 25:08.957
That is definitely the one. You bastard!

25:09.057 --> 25:12.260
Numbers one through four,
thank you very much.

25:18.066 --> 25:21.344
- I don't have to take this, man.
- You shouldn't have to.

25:21.444 --> 25:24.305
- But actually, you do.
- We're makin' you an offer.

25:24.405 --> 25:28.184
We know you work for Gonzales,
and we would rather have him than you.

25:28.284 --> 25:32.439
We'll let you out to make your buy.
We'll follow you to Gonzales, bust him...

25:32.539 --> 25:35.442
- We'll be heroes and you'll go free.
- Drop dead.

25:35.542 --> 25:39.487
- You'll want to hear your other option.
- We nail Gonzales without you...

25:39.587 --> 25:43.908
arraign you, drop the charges against you,
he thinks you rolled over on him...

25:44.008 --> 25:47.287
- ...and you drop dead.
- You got nothin' on me and less on him.

25:47.387 --> 25:49.456
Forget it.

25:49.556 --> 25:51.708
- I told you it wouldn't work.
- Yeah.

25:51.808 --> 25:54.627
It's just as well. I wouldn't
have felt right about it.

25:54.727 --> 25:58.840
Yeah. Snake, you're free to go.
Sorry to bother you.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.851
See you, Snake.

26:10.076 --> 26:13.063
One key ring, four keys.
One comb, plastic.

26:13.163 --> 26:15.357
One pack chewing gum, four pieces.

26:15.457 --> 26:18.443
- One pack condoms, unused.
- All right, all right.

26:18.543 --> 26:20.787
And one briefcase.

26:24.883 --> 26:28.411
- Where's my goddamn money?
- Relax, buster, it's all here.

26:28.511 --> 26:31.673
You'll have to sign for that.
Right here.

26:32.390 --> 26:34.842
Five thousand dollars.

26:35.518 --> 26:38.554
Five? What do you mean, five?
There's fif...

26:39.189 --> 26:42.425
- There's fifty!
- Says $5,000 here.

26:42.525 --> 26:44.769
That's your signature, right?

26:46.988 --> 26:50.650
- Yeah, but...
- What seems to be the problem, Officer?

26:53.453 --> 26:57.524
- Julio'll kill me for wearin' a wire.
- But he'll torture you for the money.

26:57.624 --> 27:02.821
Snake, you don't have to go for this.
You could file charges. Everybody else does.

27:02.921 --> 27:05.323
If you win, you get your money,
we go to jail.

27:05.423 --> 27:11.129
Of course, that'll take months, and you'll
still have to explain yourself to Gonzales.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.465
Not the shirt, Snake. The pants.

27:23.399 --> 27:25.885
I can't do it.

27:25.985 --> 27:30.140
Any problems, just yell out
"ecclesiastical" and we'll come bustin' in.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.600
- Say what?
- Say "Snakebite".

27:32.700 --> 27:35.145
- Snakebite.
- When are you makin' a buy?

27:35.245 --> 27:39.607
Tonight. So I need a van. It's all
the way over on the South Side.

27:39.707 --> 27:42.535
That's where Jackson was from, man.

27:49.217 --> 27:51.753
It's all there. $50,000.

27:53.012 --> 27:55.673
I'll count it. You load the van.

28:13.825 --> 28:17.771
I can take a lot of abuse,
but a crook suin' me, a cop?

28:17.871 --> 28:20.690
I'm tryin' to do my job.

28:20.790 --> 28:23.485
I'm gonna go to Italy.
Take some time off.

28:23.585 --> 28:27.489
Aunt Rose always said to me
"Go to Rome." I'm gonna go to Rome.

28:27.589 --> 28:31.451
Next thing you know,
I'll have to have malpractice insurance.

28:31.551 --> 28:35.622
I'm gonna buy a Trans Am.
No, a 'Vette. Better, a 'Vette.

28:35.722 --> 28:37.965
I can buy whatever I want.

28:40.185 --> 28:43.213
How much dope can you buy for $50,000?

28:43.313 --> 28:45.548
I thought she left you 40.

28:45.648 --> 28:47.975
He's got an awfully big box there.

28:52.697 --> 28:56.351
Wait a second. Tell me that
asshole isn't buying colour TVs.

28:56.451 --> 29:00.488
You can't put $50,000 worth
of hot TVs in that van.

29:15.220 --> 29:18.923
Give me a hand with this.
I gotta take one of these to Julio.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.719
- Sorry I'm late, Julio.
- Why are you here?

29:30.819 --> 29:33.221
- Gonzales.
- So those dog-ass cops busted you?

29:33.321 --> 29:37.058
- He remembers us, too.
- It was a dumb mistake. I got the stuff.

29:37.158 --> 29:42.063
- Stupid. They could have tailed you.
- No, I was careful, Julio. Real careful.

29:42.163 --> 29:44.357
What are you talkin' about?

29:44.457 --> 29:47.243
- No, Julio, listen!
- Time to go to work.

29:51.422 --> 29:54.409
- Look at this.
- Uzis. Damn it.

29:54.509 --> 29:56.995
Thanks to us,
everybody in there's got one.

29:57.095 --> 29:59.622
They gotta have at least
12 machine guns in there.

29:59.722 --> 30:02.508
Right. We'd better both go.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.366
Where are the guns?

30:27.208 --> 30:30.953
You make any noise and we
cuff you to the anchor?

30:33.339 --> 30:38.203
No, I went to Deluca. I swear,
I went to who you asked me...

30:38.303 --> 30:40.830
Julio, I wouldn't do that! Please, God!

30:40.930 --> 30:43.383
Snakebite!

30:43.558 --> 30:45.843
Police officers. Nobody move.

31:03.703 --> 31:08.282
What, am I stupid?
You think you scared me, right?

31:08.458 --> 31:11.152
You can do anything,
and guys like me gotta take it?

31:11.252 --> 31:15.490
That's enough. You make it too easy.
I remember you both as being smarter.

31:15.590 --> 31:19.452
- We've heard a lot about you, Gonzales.
- You give dope dealers a bad name.

31:19.552 --> 31:23.873
It's just the beginning. You're looking at
the first Spanish godfather of Chicago.

31:23.973 --> 31:28.803
- What about the competition?
- Competition? It's what the Uzis are for.

31:29.646 --> 31:34.342
- I almost wish you'd live to see it.
- Even you're too smart to kill cops.

31:34.442 --> 31:38.805
- Well, lucky for me, accidents happen.
- Me and Frankie'll take 'em for a swim.

31:38.905 --> 31:42.642
Better yet, we'll take 'em fishing.
Cops make good bait.

31:42.742 --> 31:46.062
- Julio, I did Jackson for you. Let me.
- Shut up.

31:46.162 --> 31:48.732
You had Jackson killed?
You leave us no choice.

31:48.832 --> 31:53.202
- You're under arrest.
- You know what a Colombian necktie is?

31:54.963 --> 31:58.249
That's when I cut your
throat from ear to ear...

31:59.134 --> 32:04.164
then I stick your tongue through the slit,
leave it dangling and watch you squirm.

32:04.264 --> 32:08.176
Oh, yes, Snake.
You should be squirmin' too.

32:08.434 --> 32:10.678
You brought them here.

32:17.485 --> 32:21.230
No, but Julio, I brought
them to you giftwrapped.

32:25.451 --> 32:29.364
- Freeze, Julio!
- Police officers. You're under arrest.

32:51.352 --> 32:54.798
- Six months of undercover work, blown!
- To save these jerks.

32:54.898 --> 32:57.342
Nobody asked you to butt in!
We made the arrest!

32:57.442 --> 33:01.054
- You let the bastard get away!
- Next time, just stay out of our way!

33:01.154 --> 33:04.057
We're the good guys.
How were we to know they're cops?

33:04.157 --> 33:08.069
They come back, we kill them.
Nobody needs to know.

33:17.170 --> 33:22.333
All right, Mano, now you shoot anybody
who comes through that door. Anybody!

33:34.020 --> 33:35.930
Let's get him.

33:43.112 --> 33:45.356
We've got you, Julio!

33:54.499 --> 33:58.411
- Is this what I wanna do when I grow up?
- What else is there?

34:04.092 --> 34:08.755
- Totally unprofessional.
- Amateurs. They could've got us killed.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.719
You're under arrest.
You know the routine.

34:23.820 --> 34:27.766
Very good. You have the right
to remain silent. Now, what else?

34:27.866 --> 34:30.109
What else?

34:30.702 --> 34:33.813
Anything I say may be used
against me in a court of law.

34:33.913 --> 34:36.733
That's two. You're doin' great.
Now what's next?

34:36.833 --> 34:38.902
I have the right to an attorney.

34:39.002 --> 34:42.655
If I cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed by the court.

34:42.755 --> 34:47.034
Yeah! Now, do you understand these
rights you just explained to us?

34:47.135 --> 34:50.996
- Oh, yes.
- A pleasure to deal with a professional.

34:51.097 --> 34:53.375
- You're gonna die for this.
- Ooh.

34:53.475 --> 34:56.511
I can feel the tension
in the air. Come on.

35:01.483 --> 35:05.553
- Gonzales got away, thanks to you.
- Listen, we didn't properly express...

35:05.653 --> 35:10.767
- We saved you. Don't make it a big deal.
- If we had to do it again, who knows?

35:10.867 --> 35:15.530
You can throw that one back in.
He's not big enough to keep.

35:20.293 --> 35:22.620
Good night, boys.

35:27.342 --> 35:29.585
Damn it.

35:33.807 --> 35:38.094
The Captain wants to give us a medal,
OK? We'll talk to you later.

35:40.897 --> 35:42.966
- Hell of a bust.
- Hey. Thank you.

35:43.066 --> 35:46.886
Commendation time. Maybe...
maybe even a promotion, right?

35:46.986 --> 35:49.605
Just doin' our job, Captain.

35:50.406 --> 35:53.893
- You busted Gonzales before the DEA.
- The DEA?

35:53.993 --> 35:58.648
They were tracking his shipment from
Colombia. But that shouldn't concern you.

35:58.748 --> 36:02.527
- There'll be other shipments.
- Forget the months of undercover work.

36:02.627 --> 36:05.155
We nailed Gonzales.
He had Jackson killed.

36:05.255 --> 36:08.867
You needlessly jeopardised your
lives and those of fellow officers.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.870
Those hotshots got nervous.
That's what happened.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.630
- Is that what happened?
- Yeah.

36:15.473 --> 36:19.135
- Freeze, Julio!
- Police officers. You're under arrest.

36:22.480 --> 36:26.809
- We got Gonzales.
- You had to be rescued like two rookies.

36:28.945 --> 36:31.139
- Maybe you need a rest.
- We don't.

36:31.239 --> 36:33.933
I need a rest from you.
I approve your vacation.

36:34.033 --> 36:38.146
- No! We got too much goin' on.
- You know, it's a very bad sign...

36:38.246 --> 36:41.441
when a cop thinks Chicago
will fall apart without him.

36:41.541 --> 36:45.195
- You're on vacation. Effective now.
- We're not goin'.

36:45.295 --> 36:50.116
Let me tell you somethin'. If I find you
in the city, I'm gonna have you arrested.

36:50.216 --> 36:54.454
If you step one foot in the station house,
I'm gonna have you shot.

36:54.554 --> 36:57.173
No. No. Come on. Come on.

37:07.984 --> 37:10.770
They've already got Jackson's badge up.

37:12.447 --> 37:16.267
- They don't waste any time.
- There's a lot of room in this case.

37:16.367 --> 37:18.687
It won't happen to us. We're too smart.

37:18.787 --> 37:21.690
- We're very smart cops.
- But we're not perfect.

37:21.790 --> 37:24.075
- You need a drink.
- No, a lot of drinks.

37:26.920 --> 37:31.616
I thought about being killed a million times.
I never believed it until Gonzales.

37:31.716 --> 37:35.036
The only thing worse than dying
young is dying young with money.

37:35.136 --> 37:37.747
I don't mind dying in
certain circumstances...

37:37.847 --> 37:40.417
but not like that. Not being humiliated.

37:40.517 --> 37:44.804
Dead can't be any worse than
being rescued by those two gerbils.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.141
This place is depressing.

38:03.123 --> 38:05.025
Why are we in Key West?

38:05.125 --> 38:09.662
It's as far south as we could get
without having to speak Spanish.

38:11.422 --> 38:16.669
Logan sends us away, and Wally and the
Beaver get credit for bustin' Gonzales.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.498
What's goin' on? What happened?

38:20.598 --> 38:24.377
- I don't know. Maybe a ship sank.
- Maybe somebody drowned.

38:24.477 --> 38:27.839
- We're watching the sunset.
- Yeah, right.

38:27.939 --> 38:31.509
- Really, what happened?
- The sun is setting. Can't you see it?

38:31.609 --> 38:33.845
Don't give us that. It sets every night.

38:33.945 --> 38:38.391
Yeah, and we come out every night
to watch it. Isn't it beautiful?

38:38.491 --> 38:41.152
Maybe we should check this out.

38:41.661 --> 38:43.905
Yeah, well, it better be good.

38:45.915 --> 38:48.201
- Hi. I'm Danny.
- Julie.

38:48.793 --> 38:50.862
So where'd you guys come in from?

38:50.962 --> 38:53.748
Julie, I come from a
planet far, far away.

39:05.935 --> 39:09.923
Hey, Ray. Come on, Ray. Come on,
Ray, the fish is winning! Come on!

39:10.023 --> 39:12.425
Never! I'll die in this chair first.

39:12.525 --> 39:17.430
Beer! Come on, he's gonna yank your ass
outta that chair. Come on, man, fish!

39:17.530 --> 39:20.517
Shut up! I got this fish figured out.

39:20.617 --> 39:26.064
First he swims, and then he jumps.
Then he swims, and then he jumps.

39:26.164 --> 39:29.993
Good. Next time he jumps, let me know.
I'll shoot him. Come on, fish!

39:30.126 --> 39:32.862
- More beer.
- Lunch.

39:32.962 --> 39:35.073
Beer.

39:35.173 --> 39:37.417
Lunch.

39:39.719 --> 39:41.963
Lunch!

39:43.765 --> 39:47.218
No more runnin' down the wrong road

39:48.353 --> 39:51.514
Dancin' to a different drum

39:52.440 --> 39:55.852
Can't you see what's goin' on?

39:56.736 --> 39:59.897
Deep inside your heart

40:00.323 --> 40:03.860
Reachin' out to meet the changes

40:05.036 --> 40:08.023
Touching every shining star

40:08.123 --> 40:12.027
The light of tomorrow
is right where we are

40:12.127 --> 40:16.281
There's no turning back
from what I am feeling

40:16.381 --> 40:20.084
Shine, sweet freedom,
shine your light on me

40:20.927 --> 40:24.789
You are the magic,
you're right where I wanna be

40:24.889 --> 40:29.127
- Oh, sweet freedom, carry me along
- Oh

40:29.227 --> 40:32.005
We'll keep the spirit alive

40:32.105 --> 40:34.640
On and on

40:36.401 --> 40:39.187
Ooh

40:40.155 --> 40:45.602
Cos there'll be starlight all night

40:45.702 --> 40:48.646
When we're close together

40:48.746 --> 40:55.362
Share those feelings
dancing in your eyes

40:55.462 --> 40:59.916
Tonight they're guiding us

41:00.216 --> 41:04.087
Shine right to the morning light

41:04.929 --> 41:07.423
Oh

41:09.392 --> 41:13.296
- That sunset's incredible.
- I never wanna leave here.

41:13.396 --> 41:16.299
- We could come back.
- We will. Next year's vacation.

41:16.399 --> 41:20.720
- I mean for good. We could move here.
- Bein' a cop here wouldn't be the same.

41:20.820 --> 41:24.557
I don't mean be a cop. I mean quit,
retire. Be a regular person.

41:24.657 --> 41:28.311
- Regular people suck.
- Maybe. But they hardly ever get shot at.

41:28.411 --> 41:30.989
- Shine, sweet freedom
- Yeah

41:32.457 --> 41:35.151
We've been cops 16 years. That's enough.

41:35.251 --> 41:38.446
- Maybe I'm not ready to quit.
- Maybe I am.

41:38.546 --> 41:43.243
- We're four years away from our pension.
- Four more years of people shootin' at us.

41:43.343 --> 41:45.453
You gonna live on Aunt Rose's money?

41:45.553 --> 41:49.749
Maybe I'll invest in a little business
down here and just enjoy myself.

41:49.849 --> 41:54.504
There's nothing to do down here but drink
and fish. You know nothing about fishing.

41:54.604 --> 41:58.508
I'll have bands. Put up a sign that
says "Every night is Ladies' Night."

41:58.608 --> 42:01.261
I'll have "Wet T-shirt Night"
for women over 70.

42:01.361 --> 42:03.888
- It's a fixer-upper.
- I'll get a better price.

42:03.988 --> 42:06.599
- It's not easy runnin' a bar.
- Nor is being a cop.

42:06.699 --> 42:09.978
A bar has more room for error.
But I'll still need my partner.

42:10.078 --> 42:13.857
I can tell. But I don't have $40,000
burnin' a hole in my pocket.

42:13.957 --> 42:16.901
You have been paying into the
pension fund for 16 years.

42:17.001 --> 42:21.865
When you quit, you get it back. Let's go
for the good life while we can enjoy it.

42:21.965 --> 42:24.075
We bust our ass in Chicago.
Nobody cares.

42:24.175 --> 42:27.704
- I still like being a cop.
- This will be the same thing.

42:27.804 --> 42:30.290
We break up fights,
we argue with drunks...

42:30.390 --> 42:35.754
we'll roust hookers, and occasionally,
if we're lucky, we will get robbed.

42:35.854 --> 42:37.922
It's sudden to talk about quittin'.

42:38.022 --> 42:41.593
- Might look like we're scared.
- We're not scared, we're smart.

42:41.693 --> 42:45.597
We're not quitting, just changing
professions. We're entrepreneurs.

42:45.697 --> 42:50.560
Hell, we drink enough to make
ourselves rich. Where was this? Here?

42:50.660 --> 42:52.854
I don't know, Danny. What's the rush?

42:52.954 --> 42:55.607
I see those two turdbrains.
That's us, ten years ago.

42:55.707 --> 42:59.444
I see us ten years from now.
We're gonna be like the Captain.

42:59.544 --> 43:03.615
- I need a drink.
- We all need drinks! We're gonna be rich!

43:03.715 --> 43:06.125
Promise me we'll get robbed. A lot.

43:12.015 --> 43:17.462
Cos there'll be starlight all night

43:17.562 --> 43:20.590
When we're close together

43:20.690 --> 43:27.305
Share those feelings
dancing in your eyes

43:27.405 --> 43:31.851
Tonight they're guiding us

43:31.951 --> 43:36.022
- Shine right till the morning light
- Shine, sweet freedom

43:36.122 --> 43:38.483
Shine your light on me

43:38.583 --> 43:42.404
You are the magic,
you're right where I want to be

43:42.504 --> 43:46.950
- Come, sweet freedom, carry me along
- Ooh

43:47.050 --> 43:51.170
We'll keep our spirit alive, oh, yeah

43:53.848 --> 43:57.051
Hey, ya shitheads!
Watch where you're goin'!

44:00.313 --> 44:04.384
- Hey, take it easy. We're in no hurry.
- Look at all these people.

44:04.484 --> 44:07.679
- Everybody's in such a rush.
- Yeah. Chicago.

44:07.779 --> 44:11.232
These people gotta learn to
stop and watch the sunset.

44:11.366 --> 44:16.438
- You're gonna what?
- Quit. Leave. Depart. Vamoose. Amscray.

44:16.538 --> 44:21.651
- Retire. This is our official, 30-day notice.
- Let me tell you something.

44:21.751 --> 44:24.946
When you've been cops this long,
you are not fit for anything.

44:25.046 --> 44:28.166
What are you gonna do? Open a bar?

44:29.175 --> 44:32.203
- We want new career challenges.
- Somethin' with a future.

44:32.303 --> 44:36.916
- What else lets you shoot people?
- We're tired of that. It never did any good.

44:37.016 --> 44:39.919
We've been on the force a long time.
Crime gets worse.

44:40.019 --> 44:44.140
- Maybe we're the problem.
- You damn well ain't the solution.

44:45.483 --> 44:48.011
- Your pal Gonzales is back on the street.
- What?

44:48.111 --> 44:52.140
He made bail. And if he gets the
right lawyer, he probably is gonna go free.

44:52.240 --> 44:55.435
Right now, he is a private citizen,
just like you two wanna be.

44:55.535 --> 44:58.688
Citizen? Gonzales shot Snake
in front of four policemen!

44:58.788 --> 45:01.608
- You saw him pull the trigger?
- He was gonna kill us!

45:01.708 --> 45:05.070
- If he had, then we woulda had a case.
- He got Jackson killed.

45:05.170 --> 45:07.906
What's the big deal?
So another bad guy takes a walk.

45:08.006 --> 45:10.408
He runs some dope.
He buys a few machine guns.

45:10.508 --> 45:14.287
He kills a cop. This is not
your concern any more.

45:14.387 --> 45:16.498
- We will nail him by tonight.
- For what?

45:16.598 --> 45:21.803
Wherever he is, he's doing something dirty.
We find Gonzales, we find a crime.

45:27.817 --> 45:30.595
Gonzales, here we come!

45:30.695 --> 45:35.066
- 30 days and we're outta here.
- And we go out heroes.

45:41.456 --> 45:43.858
It's a lot heavier than I remembered.

45:43.958 --> 45:46.661
Gonzales has an Uzi.

45:53.718 --> 45:56.329
They aren't effective if
you get shot in the face.

45:56.429 --> 45:59.007
I need it for lower-back support.

46:09.859 --> 46:12.429
Wear that, your chest
will smell like your feet.

46:12.529 --> 46:15.974
Well, in 30 days, I'll smell like
Jamaican rum and Coppertone.

46:16.074 --> 46:21.279
- Costanzo, you get transferred to Beirut?
- Ha, ha. Meter maid.

46:24.290 --> 46:26.743
What the hell?!

46:32.841 --> 46:35.335
Let me guess. You got a bad back.

46:44.519 --> 46:48.590
Señora. Hi. We sell Tupperware.
We're looking for Julio Gonzales.

46:48.690 --> 46:51.509
We sold him a lot of Jell-O
moulds and we can't find him.

46:51.609 --> 46:55.805
- Would you have a forwarding address?
- I know no Julio Gonzales. Go away.

46:55.905 --> 47:00.810
We know he lived here. Cooperate,
or you'll get a lot of trouble with inspectors.

47:00.910 --> 47:03.813
We can have the city
deliver garbage, not pick it up.

47:03.913 --> 47:06.483
Go away, pronto. I know nothing.

47:06.583 --> 47:11.245
- We can go round checking green cards.
- I tell you, go away. No questions.

47:11.504 --> 47:15.450
The owner of this slum won't be happy
if all his tenants are deported.

47:15.550 --> 47:19.671
- The owner is Julio Gonzales.
- We'll begin by deporting you.

47:20.513 --> 47:23.124
He...

47:23.224 --> 47:27.387
He has a señorita at the
Camino Real Apartments.

47:27.937 --> 47:30.848
Maybe he's there. I don't know!

47:31.441 --> 47:33.893
Do you need a lettuce crisper?

47:34.777 --> 47:37.021
- Camino Real.
- One second.

47:40.366 --> 47:42.610
Ye-e-e-es!

47:44.287 --> 47:48.108
- You handled that so professionally.
- That's what we're trained for.

47:48.208 --> 47:51.403
When fired upon, return the fire.

47:51.503 --> 47:54.406
- Hey, get away from that car!
- Hey, that's a police car!

47:54.506 --> 47:56.916
I think they know that.

47:58.426 --> 48:02.130
- It never fooled anybody anyway.
- Look at this.

48:08.686 --> 48:13.516
- I think it's around here.
- Camino Real... Camino... There it is.

48:15.777 --> 48:18.855
Ooh, bingo. Gonzales-mobile.

48:22.700 --> 48:25.562
So how come the bad guys
always have the good cars?

48:25.662 --> 48:28.773
I've been thinkin'.
We should be more responsible...

48:28.873 --> 48:31.576
in our approach to criminal matters.

48:34.129 --> 48:36.372
Ray.

48:37.924 --> 48:40.118
What are you... what are you doin'?

48:40.218 --> 48:44.414
Ray. Come on.
You're not gonna spray that car?

48:44.514 --> 48:49.344
- I have respect for personal property.
- Yeah, and I'm Walter Peyton.

48:53.523 --> 48:58.895
All right, so you make an instant towaway
zone. Very smart. But I don't like this.

49:00.238 --> 49:02.974
Now we're gonna see who catches hell.

49:03.074 --> 49:05.268
Yes! And he's gonna lead us to Gonzales.

49:05.368 --> 49:09.272
- We're not bursting in like Elliott Ness?
- What are you talkin' about?

49:09.372 --> 49:12.692
I'm slightly allergic to machine guns.
I'm calling for backup.

49:12.792 --> 49:14.786
- Backup?
- Everybody else does.

49:21.885 --> 49:25.246
- Are you sick? Come on!
- I don't want this to get out of hand.

49:25.346 --> 49:29.167
We have an obligation to the lovely
ladies of Key West. Remember them?

49:29.267 --> 49:32.796
The long legs, the flat bellies,
the tight buns and tan tits?

49:32.896 --> 49:36.132
You've done things crazier than this,
and I backed you up.

49:36.232 --> 49:38.976
Yeah, but I never got us killed.
Not once.

49:39.110 --> 49:44.440
Let's stay alive till the escrow closes on
the bar. There may be papers to sign.

49:45.533 --> 49:48.820
Ábreme! Ábreme! Ábreme!

49:50.747 --> 49:53.074
Police! Freeze!

49:55.710 --> 49:57.954
Shit!

49:58.838 --> 50:01.241
Did I come at a bad time?

50:01.341 --> 50:06.413
- We are sometimes too enthusiastic.
- Shoot those bastards!

50:06.513 --> 50:09.332
Julio is such a kidder.
I love this part.

50:09.432 --> 50:12.043
Put your guns down. You're under arrest.

50:12.143 --> 50:14.462
No hablo inglés.

50:14.562 --> 50:18.891
Oh. Hablo Smith and Wesson?

50:19.359 --> 50:21.978
You have the right to remain dead.

50:22.278 --> 50:27.900
Anything you do will be used against you.
You have the right to a coroner.

50:28.701 --> 50:33.614
If you cannot afford one, we will
appoint a medical examiner for you.

50:41.381 --> 50:44.334
- Good choice, pal.
- Get down. Drop it.

50:45.093 --> 50:48.121
- That's what you call being careful?
- Are you kidding?

50:48.221 --> 50:50.498
What is this? I have
always been careful.

50:50.598 --> 50:53.960
All these years, and behind
my back you're bein' careful?

50:54.060 --> 50:59.557
Let's go. Come on, charm bracelet. Now.
Hey. We got something on Julio after all.

51:00.275 --> 51:02.101
Mama. Mama!

51:11.870 --> 51:13.363
Out here!

51:26.426 --> 51:28.661
Hey, Gonzales. Nice legs!

51:28.761 --> 51:32.882
- Just shoot him and let's go.
- Makin' me look bad to my people?

51:42.817 --> 51:45.387
- Stay right where you are!
- All right. Calm down.

51:45.487 --> 51:48.598
Don't tell me to calm down.
Just throw me your pants.

51:48.698 --> 51:50.475
- We can't.
- We have to.

51:50.575 --> 51:53.486
Maybe we can get him with a lucky shot.

51:54.621 --> 51:58.233
- I can't even see him behind her.
- It's worth a try, though, right?

51:58.333 --> 52:00.576
As long as I keep my pants on.

52:01.211 --> 52:04.322
Now, man! Come on,
or I'm gonna drop her.

52:04.422 --> 52:06.616
You know he's gonna do this.

52:06.716 --> 52:11.037
Then we let him kill us. That's what
he wants, and there's dignity in that.

52:11.137 --> 52:13.381
As long as we keep on our pants.

52:18.603 --> 52:20.847
Now!

52:31.533 --> 52:36.771
I'm tellin' you, stop screwing around
and throw me your goddamn pants!

52:36.871 --> 52:40.992
I just threw you my pants!
Can I help it if you can't catch?

52:43.795 --> 52:47.073
- You did that on purpose.
- Right. That's exactly what I did.

52:47.173 --> 52:49.792
I know you.

52:49.968 --> 52:52.211
Now!

52:57.934 --> 52:59.961
See? That wasn't so hard, was it?

53:00.061 --> 53:04.382
So you have a better arm than I do.
But I was a better hitter and you know it.

53:04.482 --> 53:08.019
Come on. Move! Move!

53:09.195 --> 53:11.439
Hurry!

53:12.699 --> 53:14.442
Move!

53:15.869 --> 53:18.112
Move!

53:37.891 --> 53:43.546
Shit! We lost our suspect,
our keys, our car, our pants!

53:43.646 --> 53:46.925
It coulda been worse.
We coulda been shot!

53:47.025 --> 53:49.268
This is great. This is great.

53:49.736 --> 53:53.940
- There's never a cop when you need one.
- I never needed one before.

53:54.866 --> 53:59.354
Garcia, I said one backup. One backup!
You bring the Rose Parade!

53:59.454 --> 54:01.981
You never called for a backup before.

54:02.081 --> 54:04.275
We figured there was a riot.

54:04.375 --> 54:07.654
Get in the car. Would you
get in the car, Mr Backup?

54:07.754 --> 54:09.998
Get in there.

54:18.723 --> 54:20.959
Costanzo, where'd you rent those knees?

54:21.059 --> 54:24.003
You two may be quitting too
late instead of too early.

54:24.103 --> 54:28.675
I have seen it before. Short-timers' disease.
Lookin' forward to good times.

54:28.775 --> 54:30.844
- You're getting careful.
- We are not.

54:30.944 --> 54:33.596
- What's wrong with that?
- Careful gets you killed.

54:33.696 --> 54:37.225
- Worry about being shot, you get shot.
- We didn't get shot.

54:37.325 --> 54:40.186
- You got scared outta your pants.
- He had a hostage.

54:40.286 --> 54:42.355
We did what we had to do.

54:42.455 --> 54:45.233
You have been the wild men
around here for a long time.

54:45.333 --> 54:49.237
Time to pass the torch. I'm bringing
in two replacements for you to train.

54:49.337 --> 54:52.741
I want you to give 'em a
crash course on your turf.

54:52.841 --> 54:55.084
Go out with some class.

55:06.437 --> 55:10.175
How long's it gonna take you to
get this thing out on the road?

55:10.275 --> 55:14.095
You want a miracle, right? A little Bondo,
a few taps with a hammer...

55:14.195 --> 55:17.849
- She'll be good as ever, right?
- Wrong. It sticks out like a sore thumb.

55:17.949 --> 55:22.437
- Might as well be a blue-and-white.
- Hey, Ace. I want some improvements.

55:22.537 --> 55:25.482
What? A sunroof? Turbo charger?
Laser weapons? What?

55:25.582 --> 55:28.443
- I don't know what I want.
- Lemme tell you what you want.

55:28.543 --> 55:32.655
You wanna come and go like the wind.
Invincible, invulnerable, invisible.

55:32.755 --> 55:35.075
And I want it Thursday at nine.

55:35.175 --> 55:38.086
- It won't be invisible till five.
- See you then.

55:42.015 --> 55:43.041
This is it.

55:43.141 --> 55:46.094
- Call me if you need backup.
- I can handle it.

55:54.360 --> 55:57.222
- May I help you?
- Yeah. I'm looking for a Mr MJ Thomas.

55:57.322 --> 56:01.651
MJ Thomas is a Ms, not a Mr.
What do you want, pal?

56:02.452 --> 56:07.232
If that's the way it's gonna be, fine. Officer
Hughes. I have a warrant for her arrest.

56:07.332 --> 56:10.485
- What?
- Unpaid parking tickets. Lots of 'em.

56:10.585 --> 56:12.829
I've told her a million times...

56:13.880 --> 56:16.074
It's for you.

56:16.174 --> 56:18.418
She'll be here in a minute.

56:25.934 --> 56:29.337
- How did you find me?
- I'm a detective. I find people all the time.

56:29.437 --> 56:33.341
- You know, your boyfriend's an asshole.
- I seem to attract 'em.

56:33.441 --> 56:37.512
- You trying to ruin my relationship?
- No! You don't need me for that.

56:37.612 --> 56:41.391
- What do we do now?
- I have a friend who can guarantee...

56:41.491 --> 56:45.445
that you cannot be bailed
out until tomorrow morning.

56:51.584 --> 56:56.489
Key West was unbelievable. We finally
found a job where it's OK to drink on duty.

56:56.589 --> 57:00.452
- We bought our own bar.
- Sounds great. Can I come visit?

57:00.552 --> 57:04.289
Florida's outside my jurisdiction.
Maybe I can have you extradited.

57:04.389 --> 57:07.834
- What? You couldn't find a girl to arrest?
- He's saving himself.

57:07.934 --> 57:15.391
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you

57:15.775 --> 57:20.221
- Happy birthday, dear Ray...

57:20.321 --> 57:23.266
- You didn't have to do that.
- I know. I wanted to.

57:23.366 --> 57:25.894
- Where's your fiancé?
- Anna, this is Maryann.

57:25.994 --> 57:28.313
- Hi.
- She's my prisoner.

57:28.413 --> 57:31.316
- She's Danny's ex-wife.
- Maybe he's flossing.

57:31.416 --> 57:36.112
I never miss Ray's birthday. You and
Peter Pan aren't gettin' any younger.

57:36.212 --> 57:39.574
- She's gettin' married.
- Wanna know what she's marrying?

57:39.674 --> 57:42.327
Not him again? Then it's an improvement.

57:42.427 --> 57:44.496
- Anna, when's the big day?
- In June.

57:44.596 --> 57:46.664
What a shame we can't be there.

57:46.764 --> 57:49.751
- We'll be in Florida.
- What are you gonna do in Florida?

57:49.851 --> 57:54.506
We bought a bar. We're gonna retire.
Lead the good life for a change.

57:54.606 --> 57:57.058
Retire? Florida?

57:57.192 --> 57:59.427
So? You'll be fighting tooth decay.

57:59.527 --> 58:02.639
I don't really care.
I'm just surprised, that's all.

58:02.739 --> 58:07.477
- It's the time to go, while we're young.
- Yeah? How many candles on the cake?

58:07.577 --> 58:09.354
- Thirty-four.
- Thirty-six.

58:09.454 --> 58:12.148
- Thirty-four.
- Thirty-six.

58:12.248 --> 58:14.701
- Never mind.
- Wait, wait, wait.

58:16.044 --> 58:20.365
Can I have your attention, please?
Ray Hughes is 36 years old today!

58:20.465 --> 58:22.534
- 34
- I swear to God.

58:22.634 --> 58:29.757
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you

58:30.058 --> 58:34.721
Happy birthday, dear Ray...

58:35.647 --> 58:40.135
I transferred two guys from the South Side.
I hear they're a lot like you two.

58:40.235 --> 58:44.681
Like you used to be. Don't discourage
'em. Let 'em burn out naturally.

58:44.781 --> 58:47.225
Croissant?

58:47.325 --> 58:51.521
- What is this? Some cruelty joke?
- We're not working with these assholes.

58:51.621 --> 58:54.816
Listen, we're not exactly
thrilled about slowin' down.

58:54.916 --> 58:57.277
- Workin' with a handicap.
- Handicap this.

58:57.377 --> 58:59.446
Hey.

58:59.546 --> 59:02.699
Teach 'em all you know. I want
'em to be the best of the worst.

59:02.799 --> 59:05.201
Don't let me find you
doin' what they teach you.

59:05.301 --> 59:09.956
- Hey, we don't even know what we know.
- And we wouldn't waste time on them.

59:10.056 --> 59:14.878
Cut the sweet talk. Gonzales is about to
bring in a shipment. I want him nailed!

59:14.978 --> 59:19.382
You know the turf. They know Gonzales.
They got a tip where to find his cowboys.

59:19.482 --> 59:22.935
Stop bitchin' and go
and get the bastard!

59:24.863 --> 59:28.441
- Get up outta there.
- That is my Cub ball. Put it down.

59:28.867 --> 59:32.228
- I'm the Michelangelo of the motor pool.
- Ace, it is perfect!

59:32.328 --> 59:36.232
You got your siren, your radio,
your flashing lights and your fare meter.

59:36.332 --> 59:38.610
There's something not quite right here.

59:38.710 --> 59:42.989
It's your old car with modifications.
The windows are bulletproof plexiglass.

59:43.089 --> 59:45.658
You can't roll 'em down,
but you can't get shot.

59:45.758 --> 59:48.544
- Did you ask for that?
- It couldn't hurt.

59:48.720 --> 59:52.540
I feel like James Bond. You got any
machine guns or ejection seats?

59:52.640 --> 59:55.293
- Sure. Wanna leave it here?
- No, it's perfect.

59:55.393 --> 59:58.004
Just take care of it this time.
It's a masterpiece.

59:58.104 --> 01:00:00.890
Something's not right.

01:00:04.444 --> 01:00:09.691
- You gettin' ready for your new career?
- Oh, it's Heckle and Jeckle.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:13.645
It's the latest in surveillance,
in harmony with the environment.

01:00:13.745 --> 01:00:16.815
Look, I'm sayin' it looks good.
Especially the colour.

01:00:16.915 --> 01:00:20.118
Yeah. What do you call it?
The chicken-mobile?

01:00:20.668 --> 01:00:22.912
Just a sec.

01:00:28.718 --> 01:00:30.712
Hey!

01:00:33.473 --> 01:00:36.050
Now it looks like a taxi.

01:01:06.047 --> 01:01:09.242
Some of Gonzales' guys
have been crashing here.

01:01:09.342 --> 01:01:12.920
- Think we oughta get backup?
- What do you want, an air strike?

01:01:23.815 --> 01:01:26.059
Got your search warrant?

01:01:27.485 --> 01:01:30.347
Let me guess. Clint Eastwood?

01:01:30.447 --> 01:01:32.565
Dirty Tony.

01:01:33.116 --> 01:01:36.527
Hey, hey, hey. Knock. Knocking works.

01:01:39.998 --> 01:01:42.817
- Policía. Open up, por favor.
- Quién está allí...?

01:01:42.917 --> 01:01:45.745
- Por favor?

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:10.436
Freeze!

01:02:20.997 --> 01:02:23.775
- Holy shit!
- Danny! Where the hell are you?

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:26.411
I'm in Key West!

01:02:32.842 --> 01:02:35.378
Ray, I'm hit. I'm hit!

01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:38.965
Ray.

01:02:42.018 --> 01:02:44.671
- Where did you get hit?

01:02:44.771 --> 01:02:48.800
- It hurts, doesn't it?
- Yeah. 16 good years on the force...

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:51.052
and I get it from another cop.

01:02:51.152 --> 01:02:53.855
- Which one did it to you?
- Tony, I think.

01:02:54.864 --> 01:02:56.933
I'll get him for you. Don't worry.

01:02:57.033 --> 01:03:00.729
- If it's bad, you go to Florida without me.
- You're all right.

01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:05.025
- Promise me you'll go without me.
- All right. I promise I'll go without you.

01:03:05.125 --> 01:03:07.777
- You'd go without me?
- You just asked me to!

01:03:07.877 --> 01:03:12.582
Without me? You son of a bitch!
Where's my gun? I'll kill you first.

01:03:14.175 --> 01:03:16.711
Feelin' better?

01:03:18.179 --> 01:03:19.922
Must be the vest.

01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:28.548
- Hey, we got ours. Where are yours?
- You shot my partner!

01:03:28.648 --> 01:03:32.677
- Man looks fine to me.
- You're slow, or you'd have shot me first.

01:03:32.777 --> 01:03:36.014
Call that shooting?
Point-blank range and I'm still here.

01:03:36.114 --> 01:03:38.683
Let's not argue.
You're upsetting the prisoners.

01:03:38.783 --> 01:03:40.935
Why are they upset?
You didn't shoot them.

01:03:41.035 --> 01:03:44.280
- Punk.
- Juan. Juan Martinez.

01:03:44.414 --> 01:03:46.900
- You know this guy?
- We busted his father a lot.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.028
- How is old Paco?
- Retired, man. Doin' 20 in Joliet.

01:03:50.128 --> 01:03:53.323
Remember what a great informer he was?
Couldn't stand pain.

01:03:53.423 --> 01:03:55.617
Touching. A second-generation stoolie.

01:03:55.717 --> 01:03:58.536
- Come here for a second.
- Don't hit me! I'll talk.

01:03:58.636 --> 01:04:01.498
That, my friends,
is textbook police procedure.

01:04:01.598 --> 01:04:04.008
You're a lucky fella.

01:04:05.935 --> 01:04:10.590
Man, I can't do no hard time. Look, you let
me go, I'll give you big news on Gonzales.

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:13.635
In honour of old Paco,
we'll give him a little amnesty.

01:04:13.735 --> 01:04:16.262
- No, man.
- No, no. Not amnesia. Amnesty.

01:04:16.362 --> 01:04:21.267
It's like confession. Tell us something good,
and we forgive you for bein' a loser.

01:04:21.367 --> 01:04:24.145
Today he gets his shipment
on a flight from Colombia.

01:04:24.245 --> 01:04:27.031
American Trans Air. Four o'clock.

01:04:27.832 --> 01:04:32.612
- Do we tell the Sphincter Brothers?
- You wanna get shot again? Beat it.

01:04:32.712 --> 01:04:36.040
- He's gettin' away!
- He's gettin' away! Get him!

01:04:37.383 --> 01:04:39.627
Come on! He's gettin' away!

01:04:43.348 --> 01:04:45.875
We just go in, strictly low profile.

01:04:45.975 --> 01:04:50.046
We find the stuff, we trail it
to Gonzales, and we go out heroes.

01:04:50.146 --> 01:04:52.390
We certainly do.

01:04:58.029 --> 01:05:00.606
- I don't believe it.
- We've been had.

01:05:16.673 --> 01:05:18.916
That son of a bitch!

01:05:19.801 --> 01:05:22.045
Those sons of bitches!

01:05:32.897 --> 01:05:35.884
Work it, boy. Work it.
What you got? What you got?

01:05:35.984 --> 01:05:38.053
Work it, boy. That's it.

01:05:38.153 --> 01:05:41.272
OK. OK. Work it, boy. Work it.

01:05:44.951 --> 01:05:47.654
Hey, Sarge. We got somethin' over here.

01:05:54.002 --> 01:05:57.405
If it's pure, the street value
is approximately $3 million.

01:05:57.505 --> 01:05:59.783
Fantastic. Fantastic. Good work.

01:05:59.883 --> 01:06:02.535
It's bullshit! We coulda
tracked it to Gonzales.

01:06:02.635 --> 01:06:06.039
- Lose it, we miss a media opportunity.
- We wouldn't have lost it!

01:06:06.139 --> 01:06:09.959
There's ways to get Gonzales.
When he loses this much, he's in deep shit.

01:06:10.059 --> 01:06:12.754
Screw Gonzales!
That's a shitty thing to do to us!

01:06:12.854 --> 01:06:17.100
If I'm not mistaken, you two are quittin'.
What do you care?

01:06:24.449 --> 01:06:26.693
Yeah, we have the suspect.

01:06:28.203 --> 01:06:29.445
Yeah, they got him.

01:06:38.546 --> 01:06:42.492
Let me make a brief announcement,
then we'll take your questions.

01:06:42.592 --> 01:06:47.080
We have to wait for the lab report,
but this afternoon we are fairly confident...

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:52.794
that we seized cocaine with an
approximate street value of $6 million.

01:06:52.894 --> 01:06:57.090
At this time, I'd like to introduce you
to the two key officers in this arrest.

01:06:57.190 --> 01:07:00.969
- Logan's draggin' us into his sideshow.
- I hate talkin' to newsmen.

01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:04.514
Detectives Frank Sigliano
and Anthony Montoya.

01:07:04.614 --> 01:07:08.526
- They'll answer a few of your questions.
- I'm outta here.

01:07:09.744 --> 01:07:13.314
- They were apprehended an hour ago.
- Where are you holding them?

01:07:13.414 --> 01:07:15.658
They're in police custody.

01:07:18.461 --> 01:07:23.158
This is real shit.
This coke is pure shit.

01:07:23.258 --> 01:07:26.077
- It's good shit, right?
- I mean bad shit.

01:07:26.177 --> 01:07:28.663
Bad shit, like, this shit is bad?

01:07:28.763 --> 01:07:32.876
Shit shit. Not worth shit. There's
barely enough coke to attract the dogs.

01:07:32.976 --> 01:07:36.804
Anybody caught on the street
with this would get killed.

01:07:38.022 --> 01:07:40.266
Thanks.

01:07:43.695 --> 01:07:46.856
Let's see if there's other
flights from Colombia.

01:07:50.535 --> 01:07:53.146
- What is this?
- We bring Bibles to the Indians...

01:07:53.246 --> 01:07:56.274
and return with crafts
for our supporters.

01:07:56.374 --> 01:07:59.952
OK. You may close them and proceed
through the doors up there.

01:08:08.178 --> 01:08:11.456
Why is Gonzales smuggling
phoney dope through customs?

01:08:11.556 --> 01:08:14.258
Something's wrong.

01:08:14.559 --> 01:08:18.630
Look. It's Gonzales. He's got a phoney
nun and priest carrying the real coke!

01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:22.767
- The other stuff's a decoy!
- And those assholes fell for it.

01:08:27.488 --> 01:08:29.732
No. No!

01:08:31.408 --> 01:08:34.779
Wait, Julio! Our luggage!
You have our bags!

01:08:35.705 --> 01:08:39.658
- Taxi?
- Yes. We must catch that limousine.

01:08:41.377 --> 01:08:43.412
Go!

01:08:51.763 --> 01:08:54.506
Follow that car!

01:09:21.542 --> 01:09:23.493
Hey!

01:09:26.506 --> 01:09:29.125
We're not in that big a hurry.

01:09:29.425 --> 01:09:31.618
Stop, or I'll be forced to report you.

01:09:31.719 --> 01:09:35.548
Oh, shut your big fat face.
You're under arrest, douchebags.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.502
Sit. Sit back. Just shut up, penguin.

01:09:39.602 --> 01:09:44.090
The only confession you'll hear today
is when you confess to me. You got it?

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:48.770
47-63! In pursuit of black Cadillac
limo heading south on l-190.

01:09:56.453 --> 01:09:58.696
Stop!

01:10:11.551 --> 01:10:15.838
You do whatever you have to
do to get us outta here, OK?

01:10:29.944 --> 01:10:33.272
- Is this guy crazy?
- Maybe he knows a short cut.

01:11:03.812 --> 01:11:06.306
A little present for you, my friend.

01:11:11.152 --> 01:11:13.304
It works! It's really bulletproof!

01:11:13.404 --> 01:11:15.690
- Thank you, Lord!
- Thank you, Ace!

01:11:18.868 --> 01:11:21.112
Nothing.

01:11:27.335 --> 01:11:31.122
- The windows won't roll down.
- You asshole, Ace!

01:11:34.008 --> 01:11:36.578
Is that what I think it is?

01:11:36.678 --> 01:11:41.041
This might be a good time to decide
just how bad we want Gonzales.

01:11:41.141 --> 01:11:44.635
- You're scaring the passengers.
- He's bluffin'.

01:11:48.231 --> 01:11:52.060
- Chickenshit!
- You're nuts, man.

01:12:06.749 --> 01:12:12.238
47-63, a roadblock has been set up
at the next exit. Use extreme caution.

01:12:12.338 --> 01:12:17.502
47-63. Pursuit has left the interstate.
Now we're on the EI.

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:30.924
Try not to scrape the third rail, OK?
There's about 600 volts in there.

01:12:31.024 --> 01:12:33.927
It's not the voltage that
gets you, it's the amps.

01:12:34.027 --> 01:12:36.971
- How many amps are there?
- Enough to push a train.

01:12:37.071 --> 01:12:39.315
- And shut up!
- Sit back, Zorro.

01:12:52.754 --> 01:12:56.499
- I hate this.
- We're making good time.

01:13:37.966 --> 01:13:40.043
- Holy...
- Shit!

01:14:07.537 --> 01:14:11.232
- Why weren't we on that track?
- Now you're criticising my driving?

01:14:11.332 --> 01:14:14.277
You get to do all the dangerous
stuff and I get to park.

01:14:14.377 --> 01:14:16.621
- Great.
- Yeah.

01:14:17.422 --> 01:14:20.500
Hey, Father. You and
your wife owe me $28.50.

01:14:24.471 --> 01:14:26.664
We've made a terrible mistake.

01:14:26.764 --> 01:14:29.008
We know.

01:14:31.644 --> 01:14:35.014
My partner and I acted inexcusably...

01:14:35.982 --> 01:14:38.718
treating you rudely and
endangering your lives.

01:14:38.818 --> 01:14:42.480
- We...
- We mistook you for smugglers.

01:14:42.614 --> 01:14:45.517
That kid was a decoy,
carrying worthless shit... dope.

01:14:45.617 --> 01:14:49.354
It was a diversion. Pure cocaine
was smuggled in on another flight.

01:14:49.454 --> 01:14:53.191
- When we saw you with Julio...
- Julio Gonzales is a fine young man.

01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:56.194
He supports our orphanage
and our trips to Colombia.

01:14:56.294 --> 01:15:01.624
By smuggling cocaine in your souvenirs.
This is what we were after. Here.

01:15:10.475 --> 01:15:12.919
- It's sand.
- Sand.

01:15:13.019 --> 01:15:15.263
Sand?

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:22.053
In my calling, forgiveness can
become an occupational hazard.

01:15:22.153 --> 01:15:24.480
Please don't let it happen again.

01:15:38.128 --> 01:15:40.913
I'll deal with you later.

01:15:58.398 --> 01:16:00.266
Captain!

01:16:11.703 --> 01:16:15.148
- Tonight she said she was at her sister's.
- And you believe that?

01:16:15.248 --> 01:16:18.576
I got to. If I stab her again,
she's gonna leave me.

01:16:21.796 --> 01:16:24.824
- Adiós.
- Yeah, later, homes.

01:16:24.924 --> 01:16:27.168
Have a good night.

01:16:28.344 --> 01:16:31.289
Hey, what's the matter?
That tip was good, right?

01:16:31.389 --> 01:16:33.458
It was garbage. A decoy. You set us up.

01:16:33.558 --> 01:16:36.670
Now we got a dozen warrants
out on Gonzales. Where is he?

01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:40.382
Come on, man. Give me a break, huh?
Hey, slash my throat, huh?

01:16:40.482 --> 01:16:42.842
We'll give you a second chance.
Where is he?

01:16:42.942 --> 01:16:45.553
No way, Jose. That's suicide, bro.

01:16:45.653 --> 01:16:49.933
Juan, you gotta cooperate, man. We want
Gonzales, and we want him very badly.

01:16:50.033 --> 01:16:52.310
Look. Here, take me in. I'll do the time.

01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:57.357
I got some coke, some scag, some PCP.
It'll be a good bust. Hey, you can't do that!

01:16:57.457 --> 01:17:02.612
- Give us Gonzales.
- I can't, man. This is police brutality, bro.

01:17:02.712 --> 01:17:05.657
It's harassment. If it doesn't
work, we'll get brutal.

01:17:05.757 --> 01:17:09.577
Gonzales is a marked man. You protect...
What is that? That's terrible.

01:17:09.677 --> 01:17:13.506
- What? It says "Born to Squeal".
- All right! Stop! Stop!

01:17:14.682 --> 01:17:19.137
He's got a place up on the North Side.
Martindale. He's gone condo.

01:17:24.692 --> 01:17:29.147
Hey, Juan, do you think that
would look better if I used ink?

01:17:33.284 --> 01:17:36.396
- We doin' the right thing?
- Waiting for Gonzales?

01:17:36.496 --> 01:17:40.025
No, quitting. You don't think
we're turning chickenshit?

01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:43.820
Hell, no. We've given our best years
to the city. Nobody gives a damn.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.241
If we stay or leave, it doesn't matter.
If we live or die, it doesn't matter.

01:17:48.341 --> 01:17:50.410
I gotta believe we made a difference.

01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:53.288
Every stiff we put away
is out of circulation.

01:17:53.388 --> 01:17:57.625
We musta prevented millions of crimes.
We're like that garbage truck.

01:17:57.725 --> 01:18:03.139
Every night it comes and empties the cans.
Every day, the cans fill up again.

01:18:03.314 --> 01:18:07.594
But if he doesn't show up one night,
the city fills up with filth.

01:18:07.694 --> 01:18:10.472
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Yeah, I guess.

01:18:10.572 --> 01:18:14.893
What's he doin'? What, does he
think he found somebody humping?

01:18:14.993 --> 01:18:17.612
Hey! I'll get him off us.

01:18:18.121 --> 01:18:21.324
There you go. Come on. Move on.

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:27.747
Hey. Hey!

01:18:29.507 --> 01:18:32.077
- It's time to bail out, man.
- Hey.

01:18:32.177 --> 01:18:34.420
Hey, the doors are jammed.

01:18:35.221 --> 01:18:37.674
Well, push harder!

01:18:38.516 --> 01:18:40.969
What the hell is goin'...?

01:18:41.644 --> 01:18:44.222
Look!

01:18:46.483 --> 01:18:50.061
I hear you're retiring to Florida.
That's smart.

01:18:50.236 --> 01:18:53.348
- Chicago's not so safe.
- It will be before we leave.

01:18:53.448 --> 01:18:56.810
Yeah. When we finally got you
right where we want you.

01:18:56.910 --> 01:19:02.315
Look, let's be professional here?
Not personal. I'm glad to see you go.

01:19:02.415 --> 01:19:07.612
Here's a wire addressed to your
Key West bank for $142,000.

01:19:07.712 --> 01:19:10.615
That's the amount of the
mortgage on your bar.

01:19:10.715 --> 01:19:14.077
You get me back my dope and all
your troubles are behind you.

01:19:14.177 --> 01:19:20.341
You get the bar, free and clear, you coast
for a few weeks, then... Go. Sit in the sun.

01:19:21.851 --> 01:19:24.295
You take your wire
and stick it up your...

01:19:24.395 --> 01:19:29.350
Sure. You got all that money from
Aunt Rose. It's easy for you to say.

01:19:33.071 --> 01:19:35.481
Maybe it was something I said.

01:19:36.616 --> 01:19:39.185
- Shit.
- I refuse to go out in the garbage.

01:19:39.285 --> 01:19:43.406
We shoulda taken the bribe
and then busted him.

01:19:44.124 --> 01:19:47.118
We're gonna be tender cop vittles.

01:19:52.674 --> 01:19:56.578
- Ace's bulletproof glass. I'll kill him.
- You said it couldn't hurt!

01:19:56.678 --> 01:19:59.372
Oh, good. Nag at me now.
Nagging is good.

01:19:59.472 --> 01:20:03.251
- You owe me $10. I never said anything.
- You want it now?

01:20:03.351 --> 01:20:05.970
Yeah, I want it now.

01:20:11.359 --> 01:20:14.054
- You all right?
- We're off the forks.

01:20:14.154 --> 01:20:17.106
- Try your door.
- No good. No good.

01:20:21.286 --> 01:20:24.489
- Compactor.
- Shit!

01:21:17.342 --> 01:21:22.505
- This guy's gettin' on my nerves.
- Yeah. It's time we started gettin' on his.

01:21:23.097 --> 01:21:25.750
Since when do I owe you $10?

01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:27.836
I can't release this to you.

01:21:27.936 --> 01:21:31.089
This car is registered to
someone named Julio Gonzales.

01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:33.433
I need an official release.

01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:41.274
I'll take it.

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:46.362
He's gone. You got anything
you want me to sign?

01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:52.235
I could get used to this.
Think it's too late for a life of crime?

01:21:52.335 --> 01:21:56.331
I think we should just cruise
down to Florida in style.

01:21:58.550 --> 01:22:01.502
- No, no. No.
- Oh, God.

01:22:03.221 --> 01:22:06.049
Out of here. Bye.

01:22:07.142 --> 01:22:10.428
Let's see what Julio's got
in his music library.

01:22:11.479 --> 01:22:14.632
It all looks the same.
Yaka-yaka-yaka-yaka-yaka-yaka.

01:22:14.732 --> 01:22:16.976
Let's see this guy.

01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:30.231
- This hardly feels like police work.
- The way to find someone?

01:22:30.331 --> 01:22:32.825
Let them find you.

01:22:57.233 --> 01:23:01.270
All right. Move back. Move back.
Come on. Give him some room.

01:23:07.827 --> 01:23:10.071
Yeah!

01:23:22.342 --> 01:23:25.128
- Oh, hey, Julio, man.
- Julio, bro.

01:23:40.485 --> 01:23:43.513
- Hey, that's Julio's car.
- We're from Noise-Busters.

01:23:43.613 --> 01:23:46.357
Do you know where the Menudo concert is?

01:23:57.293 --> 01:24:01.072
Hello. Hola! Julio!

01:24:01.172 --> 01:24:03.491
- Tell him I said hello.
- Yeah.

01:24:03.591 --> 01:24:07.829
Julio, we've been lookin' all
over for you, man. Dónde está?

01:24:07.929 --> 01:24:10.749
Tell him I said hello.

01:24:10.849 --> 01:24:15.503
Julio... He's very excited.
Something about his car being stolen.

01:24:15.603 --> 01:24:17.964
- His car was stolen?
- I guess so.

01:24:18.064 --> 01:24:22.644
Jul... Julio, look.
You wanna file a report, amigo?

01:24:23.945 --> 01:24:27.682
- You didn't tell him I said hello.
- I tried to. He hung up on me.

01:24:27.782 --> 01:24:31.686
You gonna make the call?
It's gettin' a little late. You promised.

01:24:31.786 --> 01:24:34.030
You owe me.

01:24:37.667 --> 01:24:41.446
Oh, hello?
Can I talk to Detective Sigliano...

01:24:41.546 --> 01:24:44.616
and Detective Montoya, please?

01:24:44.716 --> 01:24:47.911
My name is Pinkie. Is this a detective?

01:24:48.011 --> 01:24:53.508
Hi. I usually inform for Hughes and Costanzo,
but they don't pay me no more.

01:24:53.641 --> 01:24:58.838
Oh, no! No, I'm just
watchin' the new Jeopardy!

01:24:58.938 --> 01:25:04.969
A man missed a Bible question because
he did not know what Deuteronomy was.

01:25:05.069 --> 01:25:07.347
Oh, yeah, I'll help you.

01:25:07.447 --> 01:25:12.310
I want you to get Gonzales and
show up Hughes and Costanzo.

01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:16.106
They don't pay me no more, and I'm mad.

01:25:16.206 --> 01:25:18.650
Oh, no!

01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:22.578
You dummy. The answer is Ipswich clams.

01:25:23.213 --> 01:25:27.617
The man who can take you
to Gonzales, his name is...

01:25:27.717 --> 01:25:29.869
Adam Robertson.

01:25:29.969 --> 01:25:39.462
He's a highfalutin lawyer type
who lives at 1358 Lakeshore Drive.

01:25:39.562 --> 01:25:42.215
Oh, Mother. Mother!

01:25:42.315 --> 01:25:46.761
Can I have some more petite
marshmallows in my hot cocoa?

01:25:46.861 --> 01:25:49.897
Ma... Gotta go! "Final Jeopardy" is on.

01:25:52.033 --> 01:25:55.103
I don't care! I don't know
nothing about no Julio!

01:25:55.203 --> 01:25:57.447
What the hell is this, man? Hey!

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.502
Leave it. I have a cleaning
lady who comes every April.

01:26:53.761 --> 01:26:57.082
- I was going through some boxes.
- What the hell is this?

01:26:57.182 --> 01:27:00.085
It's an insurance policy you
took out when we married.

01:27:00.185 --> 01:27:03.797
- God, I forgot all about this.
- I thought you should have it back.

01:27:03.897 --> 01:27:08.343
If I'm married to someone else,
maybe you wanna change the beneficiary.

01:27:08.443 --> 01:27:12.847
I got nobody else to leave it to.
So if I croak, use it for yourself.

01:27:12.947 --> 01:27:16.685
I just don't want it going for a
goddamn drill for your new husband.

01:27:16.785 --> 01:27:19.020
- What about Ray?
- He'll have half the bar.

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.440
Buy something foolish.
You'll need a little foolishness.

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:26.611
- What the hell does that mean?
- That I can't believe you're doing this.

01:27:26.711 --> 01:27:28.780
- Oh, now it comes out.
- What?

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:30.740
- You're jealous!
- Hah!

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:33.159
- "Hah"?
- It always worked for Uncle Tony.

01:27:33.259 --> 01:27:37.580
- Goddamn you.
- "Goddamn you"? Goddamn you is good.

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:40.375
- Are you really going to Florida?
- Are you jealous?

01:27:40.475 --> 01:27:43.712
No, it just sounds boring.
And you're not boring.

01:27:43.812 --> 01:27:46.548
You are marrying boring.
And you're not so boring.

01:27:46.648 --> 01:27:49.426
- Oh, yeah? Then how come we divorced?
- You wanted it.

01:27:49.526 --> 01:27:53.722
- I needed it. I didn't want it.
- Yeah? What's the difference?

01:27:53.822 --> 01:27:56.266
- I loved you too much.
- Shoulda loved me less.

01:27:56.366 --> 01:28:00.478
I couldn't. I still can't. You can't be a kid
your whole life. You have to grow up.

01:28:00.578 --> 01:28:04.532
- Why? I don't like grown-ups.
- That's exactly what I mean.

01:28:06.209 --> 01:28:10.530
- Are you really happy since we broke up?
- No... Yes! Are you?

01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:13.583
- Sure. Great. You wanna go to bed?
- Yes. No!

01:28:15.135 --> 01:28:19.464
- You're making me crazy again.
- What's wrong with being crazy?

01:28:42.287 --> 01:28:43.313
- Hello?
- Danny?

01:28:43.413 --> 01:28:45.531
- Anna. I...
- She's with me.

01:28:45.707 --> 01:28:49.110
You want her, I want my
shipment back. Tonight.

01:28:49.210 --> 01:28:54.123
Now, this is non-negotiable. You get
the stuff and then we make a trade.

01:28:55.008 --> 01:28:58.661
You hurt that lady and
you'll never be dead enough.

01:28:58.761 --> 01:29:03.083
I'm real scared. Get the stuff,
then leave a number where we can talk.

01:29:03.183 --> 01:29:07.128
I'll get the stuff. You call me,
Martini's bar, eight o'clock.

01:29:07.228 --> 01:29:12.100
One more thing. If there's a cop
anywhere around, and I mean anywhere...

01:29:12.984 --> 01:29:14.602
she loses.

01:29:53.358 --> 01:29:56.302
Gonzales has Anna.
He says he'll trade her for his dope.

01:29:56.402 --> 01:30:00.773
He knows we'll come after him.
How do you want to play it?

01:30:01.825 --> 01:30:04.777
Head on. No cops.

01:30:23.721 --> 01:30:27.792
- What the hell is this?
- I'm takin' a load of coke to the chemist.

01:30:27.892 --> 01:30:32.297
All of it? 20 keys of coke?
Isn't that a little unusual?

01:30:32.397 --> 01:30:36.051
- The lawyer thinks his client was set up.
- I better check on this.

01:30:36.151 --> 01:30:39.971
- It's all there in black and white.
- In this job, I gotta cover my ass.

01:30:40.071 --> 01:30:43.183
That's my point. You could get
my ass in a lot of trouble.

01:30:43.283 --> 01:30:45.352
Captain Logan?

01:30:45.452 --> 01:30:49.564
I got Hughes here with a request for 20
keys of coke from the missionary bust.

01:30:49.664 --> 01:30:51.733
One guy?

01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:56.913
You are going to give millions of
dollars of evidence to one guy?

01:30:58.339 --> 01:31:00.658
Where is his asshole partner?

01:31:00.758 --> 01:31:02.952
Yes, sir.

01:31:03.052 --> 01:31:05.421
- No way.
- Goodbye.

01:31:07.223 --> 01:31:11.386
He says not to give you anything.
Not until your partner shows.

01:31:22.530 --> 01:31:26.192
Logan just chewed my ass out.
What the hell is goin' on?

01:31:27.327 --> 01:31:30.905
Now you can check out your evidence.
Sign the papers.

01:31:35.710 --> 01:31:40.289
Sorry, folks. We're closing early tonight.
Come back another time.

01:31:41.007 --> 01:31:44.244
- Thanks, Vinny.
- How many you figure?

01:31:44.344 --> 01:31:46.705
- More than six apiece?
- Maybe.

01:31:46.805 --> 01:31:50.417
I hate mosquitos.
Florida's filled with goddamn mosquitos.

01:31:50.517 --> 01:31:54.379
- It's the humidity I hate.
- The only baseball is spring training.

01:31:54.479 --> 01:31:57.841
They don't have a pro basketball team.
Or even thick pizza.

01:31:57.941 --> 01:32:01.094
- I hate skinny pizza.
- You eat too much, you still lose weight.

01:32:01.194 --> 01:32:04.472
A lotta old people there, too.
You go there, you get old and die.

01:32:04.572 --> 01:32:07.392
- Oh, it's the law.
- All the white shoes...

01:32:07.492 --> 01:32:11.354
- Yeah, and white belts.
- Sorry, fellas. We're closed.

01:32:11.454 --> 01:32:15.817
- Shit.
- Hey, not tonight, guys, huh?

01:32:15.917 --> 01:32:19.871
- Hey, man. You made us look bad.
- That arrest was fucked up.

01:32:21.131 --> 01:32:23.742
Look, we're waiting for our dates.

01:32:23.842 --> 01:32:27.211
Hey, another round here,
plus two Scotches, please.

01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:33.635
You're supposed to be showin' us
the ropes, not holdin' out on us.

01:32:38.356 --> 01:32:42.226
- Let's go.
- What? Your girls get a better offer?

01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:51.770
Two Scotches, a Perrier
and a Virgin Mary.

01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:54.356
- Perrier?
- That's all they were drinkin'?

01:32:54.456 --> 01:32:57.575
- That's it. $7.50.
- They're holdin' out on us.

01:33:10.263 --> 01:33:13.750
I told him the swap had to be
in a public place. I insisted on it.

01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:17.462
- What did he say?
- He agreed. I don't like it.

01:33:17.562 --> 01:33:20.598
- Where?
- The State Building.

01:33:28.281 --> 01:33:31.476
Why a government building
crawling with armed security?

01:33:31.576 --> 01:33:36.606
So we won't try anything. We show a gun,
we'll be facing a dozen state troopers.

01:33:36.706 --> 01:33:40.610
I'll take the bag in, but they'll
be watching every door for you.

01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:43.121
I'll be there.

01:33:43.713 --> 01:33:47.701
- We're treating this like any other bust?
- Yeah. Just don't be careful.

01:33:47.801 --> 01:33:50.086
Hey, you neither.

01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:56.736
You understand what I'm tryin' to say?

01:34:57.704 --> 01:35:01.324
Juan. What the hell is goin' on here?

01:35:14.179 --> 01:35:17.590
- Can I get to the top without being seen?
- You can't.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.169
A freight elevator?
A fire escape? Anything?

01:35:21.269 --> 01:35:25.348
- Just the window washers' rig.
- Shit!

01:35:59.099 --> 01:36:01.342
Oh, my God.

01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:42.759
No, no, no, no. You don't get
that till the girl goes free.

01:37:35.612 --> 01:37:38.147
Very good.

01:37:45.872 --> 01:37:47.907
- Now.
- Get down!

01:38:04.849 --> 01:38:07.093
- Police officers!
- Don't shoot!

01:38:18.947 --> 01:38:22.358
Shoot 'em! They're with Gonzales!
Shoot 'em!

01:38:33.211 --> 01:38:35.913
Anna! Is your door open?

01:38:41.219 --> 01:38:43.496
No. It's locked.

01:38:43.596 --> 01:38:46.916
- Then you're gonna have to jump to me.
- No way. You jump.

01:38:47.016 --> 01:38:51.929
Anna, your door is locked.
You are going to have to jump to me.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:04.351
Hey, Julio!

01:39:04.451 --> 01:39:07.654
You want your coke? Come and get it!

01:39:09.122 --> 01:39:11.366
Here you go, boys!

01:39:11.541 --> 01:39:13.951
No. No!

01:39:14.210 --> 01:39:18.323
Come on, Julio. Here's your coke. Yeah!

01:39:18.423 --> 01:39:20.116
No!

01:39:20.216 --> 01:39:23.544
My coke! My coke!

01:39:24.471 --> 01:39:27.165
- Come on. Come and get it.
- Get my coke!

01:39:27.265 --> 01:39:29.626
Here you go!

01:39:29.726 --> 01:39:32.345
Come on!

01:39:33.146 --> 01:39:35.807
Get my coke!

01:39:40.111 --> 01:39:43.690
Anna, come on. Get up! Get up!

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:48.277
Come on, let's go. Don't look down.
Don't look down!

01:39:48.495 --> 01:39:52.023
- Come on, jump. I'll catch you.
- You better.

01:39:52.123 --> 01:39:54.158
Now!

01:40:11.267 --> 01:40:13.511
That's right.

01:40:31.621 --> 01:40:33.489
Take this. You'll be safe here.

01:40:36.126 --> 01:40:38.369
Julio...

01:40:55.019 --> 01:40:56.721
Excuse me.

01:41:09.451 --> 01:41:11.694
Yeah.

01:41:13.413 --> 01:41:15.657
Good night, suckers.

01:41:22.422 --> 01:41:24.824
I got him! I got him!

01:41:24.924 --> 01:41:26.834
Bullshit! I got him!

01:41:27.761 --> 01:41:30.955
Pardon me, Officer, but I got
him from right over there.

01:41:31.055 --> 01:41:35.001
Well, this is a real topper. A topper!
I hit that man with every shot!

01:41:35.101 --> 01:41:39.172
This is frightening. In other words,
you've hit everybody you ever shot at.

01:41:39.272 --> 01:41:42.509
No, I haven't hit everybody.
But I hit him.

01:41:42.609 --> 01:41:45.053
Great. This is just great.

01:41:45.153 --> 01:41:47.806
You did all right.
Not that we couldn't have.

01:41:47.906 --> 01:41:50.058
Listen, man. I just wanna say...

01:41:50.158 --> 01:41:52.477
Hey. We saved you.
Don't make it a big deal.

01:41:52.577 --> 01:41:56.064
That's right. And if we had it
to do over again, who knows?

01:41:56.164 --> 01:42:01.236
Freeze! Now, you drop your gun,
or these two right here, they're dead.

01:42:01.336 --> 01:42:04.539
- I thought you got him.
- I thought you got him.

01:42:08.635 --> 01:42:10.128
Boom.

01:42:37.539 --> 01:42:42.118
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK. I'm not great, but I'm OK.

01:42:43.086 --> 01:42:45.613
I got shot.

01:42:45.713 --> 01:42:48.616
- It's about time.
- You got him.

01:42:48.716 --> 01:42:51.669
- Nah, you got him.
- You're right.

01:42:53.513 --> 01:42:55.757
Danny!

01:43:04.065 --> 01:43:06.176
So what happened to that dentist?

01:43:06.276 --> 01:43:08.887
- Who?
- Right.

01:43:08.987 --> 01:43:12.899
- Almost got us killed.
- You guys are crazy.

01:43:13.616 --> 01:43:18.813
- I think they need a little more seasoning.
- They're still rough around the edges.

01:43:18.913 --> 01:43:21.157
Yeah.

01:43:22.375 --> 01:43:24.619
Here.

01:43:28.173 --> 01:43:31.409
- Will Chicago be safe in their hands?
- Oh, no.

01:43:31.509 --> 01:43:33.753
Yeah.

01:43:35.221 --> 01:43:37.499
Millions of people out there to protect.

01:43:37.599 --> 01:43:41.260
Yep. We owe it to this fine city.

01:43:43.104 --> 01:43:47.433
Hey. You guys wanna buy a bar?

01:43:58.036 --> 01:44:00.488
Ooh, yeah

01:44:02.749 --> 01:44:05.360
Gettin' ready for the good times

01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:08.871
Cos it's the only way to go

01:44:09.964 --> 01:44:13.118
So get on up, lock into the rhythm

01:44:13.218 --> 01:44:16.663
Let the music take control

01:44:16.763 --> 01:44:21.334
- This is it
- Reach for that feeling

01:44:21.434 --> 01:44:25.296
We need love tonight

01:44:25.396 --> 01:44:28.800
No rhyme or reason

01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:33.138
Is gonna stop us rockin' and reelin'

01:44:33.238 --> 01:44:34.931
Oh, baby, come on

01:44:35.031 --> 01:44:38.518
- Too late to start
- You know it's never too late

01:44:38.618 --> 01:44:42.397
- Open up your heart
- Open up your heart now, baby

01:44:42.497 --> 01:44:46.109

- Get up
- You know, it's never too late to start

01:44:54.843 --> 01:44:59.956
Ooh, it's time to take it to the nation

01:45:00.056 --> 01:45:03.760
And let the power of love decide

01:45:04.853 --> 01:45:11.468
We're gonna make it, baby, we can
shake it till the sun begins to rise

01:45:11.568 --> 01:45:14.637
- This is it, now
- Reach for that feeling

01:45:14.737 --> 01:45:19.275
Whoa, and we'll light the light

01:45:20.243 --> 01:45:23.646
No rhyme or reason

01:45:23.746 --> 01:45:27.650
Is gonna stop us rockin' and reelin'

01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:31.112
- So baby, come on, yeah
- Too late to start

01:45:31.212 --> 01:45:33.323

- Get up
- You know it's never too late to start

01:45:46.269 --> 01:45:49.839
We're on a groove that never dies

01:45:49.939 --> 01:45:54.727
Whatever happens, it's all right

01:45:55.737 --> 01:45:59.307
There is no magic that we can't do

01:45:59.407 --> 01:46:03.478
So take a chance
and let the love come shining through

01:46:03.578 --> 01:46:07.065
- Too late to start
- No, it's not too late

01:46:07.165 --> 01:46:11.069
- Open up your heart
- Not too late

01:46:11.169 --> 01:46:14.739
