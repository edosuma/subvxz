00:40.523 --> 00:45.215
Come on! Get the lead out!

00:47.530 --> 00:52.222
Run the fuckers over!

01:02.545 --> 01:06.014
Come on, Jamie!

01:06.015 --> 01:08.248
Come on! Get up!

01:08.250 --> 01:12.942
Get up!

01:32.575 --> 01:35.377
This plane is for members of
the provisional government only.

01:35.378 --> 01:40.070
Which of your men do I kill
to make room for mine?

01:41.283 --> 01:45.975
Get in! Get in!

01:50.659 --> 01:51.760
Straight ahead.

01:51.761 --> 01:56.163
Everybody look straight ahead.

01:56.164 --> 02:00.856
Stop it!

02:06.675 --> 02:11.367
This man's dead! Get him out!

02:18.220 --> 02:22.912
He's alive, you pimp!

02:24.826 --> 02:28.395
Everybody comes with me
goes home.

02:28.396 --> 02:33.001
Let's go.

02:33.002 --> 02:37.694
Let's see this thing fly!

03:16.778 --> 03:19.780
What name have you given
to your child?

03:19.781 --> 03:22.684
Richard Patrick Miller.

03:22.685 --> 03:26.186
And what do you ask of
God's Church for your child?

03:26.187 --> 03:30.824
Baptism.

03:30.825 --> 03:37.994
If your faith makes you ready
to accept this responsibility...

03:38.033 --> 03:42.725
renew now the vows
of your own baptism.

03:44.205 --> 03:47.173
Reject sin.

03:47.174 --> 03:51.866
Profess faith in Jesus Christ.

03:53.747 --> 03:58.152
This is
the faith of the Church...

03:58.153 --> 04:01.055
This is the faith
in which this child...

04:01.056 --> 04:04.892
is about to be baptized.

04:04.893 --> 04:06.327
Do you reject Satan?

04:06.328 --> 04:09.128
- I do.
- I do.

04:09.129 --> 04:10.763
And all his works?

04:10.764 --> 04:13.399
- I do.
- Yes, I do.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.469
And all his empty promises?

04:15.470 --> 04:20.161
- I do.
- I do.

04:34.623 --> 04:36.155
Let me hear from you.

04:36.156 --> 04:39.158
I want to know
how the kid's doing.

04:39.159 --> 04:41.195
Where he goes to school.
All that.

04:41.196 --> 04:43.998
When Richard deserted
in Vietnam...

04:43.999 --> 04:45.566
I wish you'd had him arrested...

04:45.567 --> 04:48.701
instead of bringing him back
and covering for him.

04:48.702 --> 04:50.404
He was yours after that.

04:50.405 --> 04:53.274
He wanted you to be
the baby's godfather...

04:53.275 --> 04:54.408
so you are.

04:54.409 --> 04:57.311
Don't come around anymore,
please.

04:57.312 --> 05:02.004
Come on, Jamie!

05:15.130 --> 05:19.822
No mail.

05:22.771 --> 05:24.605
What is this, Watergate again?

05:24.606 --> 05:26.039
Don't give me
that Watergate stuff.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.207
- Look at you.
- What's the matter with me?

05:28.208 --> 05:29.842
I was good enough for you
when you married me.

05:29.843 --> 05:31.644
I can't stand looking at you.

05:31.645 --> 05:32.713
No wonder I haven't
got any money to...

05:32.714 --> 05:37.406
I work 14 hours a day...

06:41.515 --> 06:43.384
Do dogs get too fat?

06:43.385 --> 06:45.251
Now, we also heard
of a woman in Los Angeles...

06:45.252 --> 06:47.887
who will write a song
for your dog.

06:47.888 --> 06:49.288
You send her a picture
of your pet...

06:49.290 --> 06:51.924
along with a biography
and $75...

06:51.926 --> 06:53.794
and she'll send you
a cassette...

06:53.795 --> 06:58.487
a musical portrait
of your pooch.

07:03.537 --> 07:06.240
You got any money?

07:06.241 --> 07:10.933
What's it to you?

07:27.027 --> 07:31.719
You can always be a beggar
when you grow up.

08:08.902 --> 08:11.904
Endean?

08:11.905 --> 08:16.598
No, I don't know him.

09:12.299 --> 09:13.662
How'd you get up here?

09:13.663 --> 09:18.355
Yes.

09:22.409 --> 09:25.945
The corporate interests
I represent...

09:25.946 --> 09:29.283
contemplate investing several
hundred million dollars...

09:29.284 --> 09:34.722
in the development of
certain resources in Zangaro.

09:34.756 --> 09:38.659
- Where?
- West Africa.

09:38.660 --> 09:42.029
Do you read the papers,
Mr. Shannon?

09:42.030 --> 09:45.666
The president, Olu Kimba,
is frequently on the front page.

09:45.667 --> 09:46.966
Yeah. Go on.

09:46.967 --> 09:51.965
Before money is invested
in Zangaro...

09:52.006 --> 09:54.141
we have to know a lot more...

09:54.142 --> 09:58.834
about the stability
of Kimba's regime.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.447
Is a coup d'Ã©tat imminent...

10:01.448 --> 10:03.784
or even possible?

10:03.785 --> 10:06.552
We have to know.

10:06.553 --> 10:10.057
You can get that information
through an embassy.

10:10.058 --> 10:12.860
Who the hell do you think
has diplomatic relations...

10:12.861 --> 10:14.661
with a maniac like Kimba?

10:14.662 --> 10:16.029
I don't know.

10:16.030 --> 10:19.066
Mr. Shannon, the world is
running short of commodities.

10:19.067 --> 10:23.136
One day,
we'll go to war over rice.

10:23.137 --> 10:26.306
The job pays $10,000.

10:26.307 --> 10:28.775
Fifteen.

10:28.776 --> 10:32.745
Half tomorrow,
the rest when I get back.

10:32.746 --> 10:34.914
It's only a reconnaissance.

10:34.915 --> 10:37.251
- Did you steal this?
- No.

10:37.252 --> 10:39.285
- You sure?
- I don't steal.

10:39.286 --> 10:42.155
- You got 35 to 100.
- That's good.

10:42.156 --> 10:43.389
What do you know
about bird-watching?

10:43.390 --> 10:46.292
Ornithology.
Don't stand right under them.

10:46.293 --> 10:48.227
- How long you'll be gone?
- A week.

10:48.228 --> 10:49.762
Watch yourself, Jamie.

10:49.763 --> 10:51.965
- Red on red?
- Pull it out.

10:51.966 --> 10:53.533
I'm not back in a month
to two years...

10:53.534 --> 10:54.801
you and Drew come get me.

10:54.802 --> 10:56.703
You bet.
He was in here last week.

10:56.704 --> 10:58.472
He wanted me to go
bear-hunting with him...

10:58.473 --> 11:00.073
in Canada
with a bow and arrow.

11:00.074 --> 11:01.140
Smart.

11:01.141 --> 11:03.409
Seemed like a damn messy way
to be killed to me.

11:03.410 --> 11:04.745
- He go?
- I don't know.

11:04.746 --> 11:07.613
He told me about the baptism.
That's damn fine.

11:07.615 --> 11:10.384
You'll be a hell of a godfather.

11:10.385 --> 11:15.077
I'll see you.

11:24.498 --> 11:29.190
You got a godfather?

11:53.928 --> 11:56.195
Going in with
such a conspicuous cover...

11:56.196 --> 11:58.132
is unnecessarily risky.

11:58.133 --> 11:59.867
I need a reason
to be there with a camera.

11:59.868 --> 12:01.167
Go as a tourist.

12:01.168 --> 12:04.537
Don't worry about it.

12:04.538 --> 12:07.141
What the hell is a tourist
doing in Zangaro?

12:07.142 --> 12:09.108
- I've no idea.
- Right.

12:09.109 --> 12:12.545
A reconnaissance is no good
if you don't come back.

12:12.546 --> 12:17.238
I al ways come back.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.130
Please sit up
and fasten your seat belt.

12:31.131 --> 12:35.824
Thank you.

13:27.855 --> 13:30.990
Brown?

13:30.991 --> 13:35.429
Keith Brown, yes.

13:35.430 --> 13:37.297
What business do you have
in Zangaro?

13:37.298 --> 13:39.333
I work for a nature magazine.

13:39.334 --> 13:41.235
I take pictures of birds.

13:41.236 --> 13:44.338
Pictures of birds.

13:44.339 --> 13:49.008
Yes.

13:49.009 --> 13:53.701
In there.

13:54.114 --> 13:56.115
Attention, please.

13:56.116 --> 13:59.952
Here is
an important announcement.

13:59.954 --> 14:03.189
Visitors to Zangaro
are warned...

14:03.190 --> 14:06.759
that there is a curfew
in the city of Clarence...

14:06.760 --> 14:11.453
between 6 p. m. and 6 a. m.

14:11.532 --> 14:13.433
Do you have a drinking problem,
Mr. Brown?

14:13.434 --> 14:16.602
I thought there might be
a problem with the water.

14:16.604 --> 14:21.296
There is.

14:36.790 --> 14:41.483
Your pockets, please.

14:42.130 --> 14:46.822
Spanish. French.

14:57.511 --> 15:02.203
This is
Military Order number 602.

15:02.516 --> 15:07.208
Long live President Kimba.

15:21.635 --> 15:26.327
Airport tax.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.546
What's that for, sport?

15:33.547 --> 15:38.239
Importation tax.

15:49.597 --> 15:54.289
Wel come to Zangaro.

16:05.747 --> 16:09.949
Can I give you
a lift into town, my son?

16:09.950 --> 16:14.642
Yes. Thank you.

17:02.437 --> 17:04.438
Is this your first trip
to Zangaro?

17:04.439 --> 17:07.406
Yes.

17:07.407 --> 17:12.099
Wel come to Clarence.

17:28.729 --> 17:29.896
Thanks again.

17:29.897 --> 17:34.589
Good-bye. God bless.

17:50.918 --> 17:53.486
Hello.
My name is Keith Brown.

17:53.487 --> 17:58.179
I cabled you about a room.

17:59.393 --> 18:04.085
Brown.

18:13.207 --> 18:16.442
We've received no cable,
Mr. Brown.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.910
I sent it last week.

18:17.911 --> 18:21.481
The telegraph system
is somewhat irregular.

18:21.482 --> 18:23.850
How long do you wish
to stay with us?

18:23.851 --> 18:27.020
Four or five days.

18:27.021 --> 18:29.555
You got something quiet,
maybe in the back?

18:29.556 --> 18:34.193
Foreigners are restricted
to the second floor.

18:34.194 --> 18:37.664
Whatever you got
with its own shower.

18:37.665 --> 18:39.265
Your passport, please.

18:39.266 --> 18:41.167
Do you need that?

18:41.168 --> 18:45.860
It will be returned to you
when you leave.

18:50.077 --> 18:54.769
You will have... room 12.

19:52.373 --> 19:56.643
Mr. Brown, your jeep is outside.

19:56.644 --> 20:01.336
Great.

23:56.149 --> 24:00.841
In my jungle,
you'd be just another asshole.

24:10.496 --> 24:13.366
Keep turning on the boy.

24:13.367 --> 24:17.103
Keep shooting.

24:17.104 --> 24:20.907
Listen, we've got permission...

24:20.908 --> 24:25.600
Watch the jeep!

24:26.713 --> 24:28.915
Take it easy.
Everything's all right.

24:28.916 --> 24:33.608
This way.
Ken, keep it on the boy.

24:38.424 --> 24:41.159
Good evening, Mr. Brown.
Did you get many pictures?

24:41.160 --> 24:43.663
That guy you sent me
this morning isn't working out.

24:43.664 --> 24:47.999
I didn't send him.

24:48.001 --> 24:50.136
We can't make a film
about your bloody country...

24:50.137 --> 24:54.829
from the hotel lobby,
for Christ's sake!

24:57.411 --> 25:01.514
Thank you very kindly.

25:01.515 --> 25:04.050
Lousy bastards.

25:04.051 --> 25:06.385
Jeez. That kid, eh?

25:06.386 --> 25:08.253
Aw, bastards.

25:08.254 --> 25:09.322
Bastards!

25:09.323 --> 25:10.522
Leave it, for Christ's sake.

25:10.523 --> 25:12.158
We'll be out of here
by the end of the week.

25:12.159 --> 25:16.294
How about a beer?
Beer, Alan?

25:16.296 --> 25:20.988
Bollocks!

25:24.705 --> 25:26.204
Having some trouble, Mr. North?

25:26.205 --> 25:27.339
Just a fundamental difference...

25:27.340 --> 25:29.207
about the value of human life,
Mr. Dexter.

25:29.208 --> 25:31.344
Nothing that need concern you.

25:31.345 --> 25:34.347
Stupid question,
but any messages for me?

25:34.348 --> 25:35.962
The wireless is still out.

25:35.963 --> 25:37.549
Is it expected in soon?

25:37.550 --> 25:42.154
Mr. North, this is
Mr. Keith Brown, an American.

25:42.155 --> 25:45.390
That shouldn't be too much
of a language barrier.

25:45.391 --> 25:47.292
Shall we give it a try?
Beer?

25:47.293 --> 25:51.985
Sure.

26:10.950 --> 26:12.217
What about the Russians?

26:12.218 --> 26:14.419
There were a couple
of mining engineers...

26:14.420 --> 26:18.423
in here a few months ago,
doing some kind of survey.

26:18.424 --> 26:19.725
The Russians
must have got onto it...

26:19.726 --> 26:20.926
and sent these two down.

26:20.927 --> 26:23.895
They haven't been able
to get a government permit.

26:23.896 --> 26:28.589
Poor bastards
are losing their minds.

26:31.304 --> 26:35.996
Put on your party smile.

26:41.814 --> 26:46.507
Good evening.

26:50.990 --> 26:53.892
President Kimba.

26:53.893 --> 26:58.585
President.

27:00.033 --> 27:04.302
Mr. Keith Brown.
American naturalist.

27:04.304 --> 27:07.472
How you doing?

27:07.473 --> 27:12.078
President Kimba shares
your interest in our wildlife...

27:12.079 --> 27:15.181
especially our native birds.

27:15.182 --> 27:18.517
Drink.

27:18.518 --> 27:20.820
Sure.

27:20.821 --> 27:25.023
Very kind.

27:25.024 --> 27:27.859
Here's to you.

27:27.860 --> 27:30.629
Due to his
many responsibilities...

27:30.630 --> 27:33.432
President Kimba
doesn't have the time...

27:33.433 --> 27:35.600
to research
the scientific names...

27:35.601 --> 27:37.502
of some of our rare species.

27:37.503 --> 27:39.237
Busy, busy, busy.

27:39.238 --> 27:42.240
Drink.

27:42.241 --> 27:45.143
No. One for my father.

27:45.144 --> 27:49.014
So kind.

27:49.015 --> 27:52.451
It would please
the president enormously...

27:52.452 --> 27:55.787
if you could give him
a scientific name...

27:55.788 --> 27:57.389
for the great crested grebe.

27:57.390 --> 28:01.959
Yeah?

28:01.960 --> 28:06.652
Maybe some other time.

28:10.503 --> 28:12.037
Just for you.

28:12.038 --> 28:16.730
Podiceps cristatus. Right?

28:19.145 --> 28:21.680
And the storm petrel?

28:21.681 --> 28:23.914
Hydrobates...

28:23.915 --> 28:26.118
there's more... Pelagius.

28:26.119 --> 28:29.855
Right?

28:29.856 --> 28:33.325
And what about
the bubbling cisticola?

28:33.326 --> 28:35.993
The esmaralda troglodytes.

28:35.994 --> 28:38.195
And there's
my absolute favorite...

28:38.196 --> 28:43.395
and yours... Nectarina famosa.

28:43.436 --> 28:48.128
Here's to them, God bless them.

28:48.541 --> 28:53.233
Drink.

28:53.613 --> 28:58.305
Public drunkenness
is a crime in Zangaro.

29:04.357 --> 29:07.925
Who's that guy?

29:07.926 --> 29:12.618
Woody Woodpecker?

29:15.767 --> 29:19.638
Good evening, Miss Dexter.

29:19.639 --> 29:21.572
Mr. Brown...

29:21.573 --> 29:22.873
I'm Gabrielle Dexter.

29:22.874 --> 29:27.567
My father suggested I show you
around Clarence tomorrow.

29:27.714 --> 29:28.814
Sounds good.

29:28.815 --> 29:33.507
Meet me in the lobby at 8:00.

29:35.221 --> 29:37.856
That's the only sight worth
seeing in this bloody town.

29:37.857 --> 29:40.225
It's friendly, too.

29:40.226 --> 29:44.496
I wouldn't know.
It doesn't talk to me.

29:44.497 --> 29:46.298
One for the road?

29:46.299 --> 29:50.991
No, thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.

30:05.617 --> 30:06.917
Around here...

30:06.918 --> 30:11.611
even the birds know better
than to be out at night.

30:13.893 --> 30:15.292
What do you know about birds?

30:15.293 --> 30:19.986
Well, I'm no expert... either.

30:27.039 --> 30:31.731
What did you guys do
to get in trouble today?

30:41.386 --> 30:46.078
A bunch of soldiers
were hauling off a young kid.

30:47.693 --> 30:49.226
He was scared out of his wits.

30:49.227 --> 30:53.397
Finally, he managed
to pull himself free.

30:53.398 --> 30:56.300
One of the bastards drove
a bayonet through his throat.

30:56.301 --> 30:59.171
We were right there
with the camera.

30:59.172 --> 31:00.272
We got it.

31:00.273 --> 31:02.441
Then they ripped the film
out of the camera...

31:02.442 --> 31:04.041
and herded us back here.

31:04.042 --> 31:07.712
I'm surprised Kimba
I ets you people in here.

31:07.713 --> 31:09.848
I'll be more surprised
if he lets us out.

31:09.849 --> 31:12.249
How'd he get the job?

31:12.250 --> 31:16.087
Well, after
they won independence...

31:16.088 --> 31:19.758
there were three candidates
for the presidency...

31:19.759 --> 31:21.892
General Kimba...

31:21.893 --> 31:23.594
a Colonel Bobi...

31:23.595 --> 31:26.964
and a physician,
a moderate called Dr. Okoye.

31:26.965 --> 31:31.368
Okoye wanted to maintain links
with the mother country...

31:31.370 --> 31:33.472
while our two gallant
freedom fighters...

31:33.473 --> 31:38.536
ranted about
neocolonialism, et cetera.

31:38.578 --> 31:39.910
Kimba got elected.

31:39.911 --> 31:43.582
Don't ask me
why he won over Bobi.

31:43.583 --> 31:47.419
From what I've heard,
nothing to choose between them.

31:47.420 --> 31:50.489
A week after
Kimba took office...

31:50.490 --> 31:53.657
he forced Bobi into exile
and threw Dr. Okoye in prison.

31:53.658 --> 31:55.694
Any opposition left?

31:55.695 --> 31:58.896
You don't oppose Kimba.
That's treason.

31:58.897 --> 32:02.566
For that, he has
your entire family murdered.

32:02.567 --> 32:05.569
Nobody really knows
what's going on here.

32:05.570 --> 32:07.706
You'd think
whatever his name is...

32:07.707 --> 32:09.541
would come in here
and kick him out.

32:09.542 --> 32:11.642
He's no threat
to any other country.

32:11.643 --> 32:14.446
He's content to stay
within his borders...

32:14.447 --> 32:16.548
and slaughter his own.

32:16.549 --> 32:18.049
I mean slaughter.

32:18.050 --> 32:21.118
Can't you smell it?

32:21.119 --> 32:24.221
Trouble is...

32:24.222 --> 32:28.894
there's so much of it
everywhere else in the world...

32:28.895 --> 32:33.587
nobody wants to know.

32:36.768 --> 32:39.905
Right. You're a quiet one.

32:39.906 --> 32:42.173
Bird-watching's
a quiet business.

32:42.174 --> 32:45.142
How would you know?

32:45.143 --> 32:48.747
You're not CIA, are you?

32:48.748 --> 32:53.084
You're hardly KGB.

32:53.085 --> 32:54.318
Thanks for the drink.

32:54.319 --> 32:59.011
You are, aren't you?
You're fucking CIA.

33:34.393 --> 33:38.362
This is President Kimba's
official residence.

33:38.363 --> 33:41.298
It belonged to the British
governor in colonial times.

33:41.299 --> 33:43.834
You live in a place like that,
I'll bet you stay home a lot.

33:43.835 --> 33:47.037
The president
no longer lives here.

33:47.039 --> 33:50.741
God spoke to him in a dream.

33:50.742 --> 33:54.346
He told him he should live
among his warriors.

33:54.347 --> 33:56.914
Where is that, the jungle?

33:56.915 --> 34:00.651
He lives at the garrison.

34:00.652 --> 34:04.021
In 1937,
the colonial government...

34:04.022 --> 34:06.524
erected new ministerial offices.

34:06.525 --> 34:10.393
It was the first electricity
in Zangaro.

34:10.395 --> 34:14.733
A year later,
the Grand Pavilion was built.

34:14.734 --> 34:16.434
At the spring assemblies...

34:16.435 --> 34:20.371
as many as a thousand people
would dance inside.

34:20.373 --> 34:22.540
The chandeliers
were shipped from Europe.

34:22.541 --> 34:24.376
You got a passport?

34:24.377 --> 34:25.909
Why do you ask?

34:25.911 --> 34:30.603
I can't believe you stay here.

34:32.317 --> 34:35.286
This is not America, Mr. Brown.

34:35.286 --> 34:38.589
What I do is never governed
by choice...

34:38.590 --> 34:40.324
only by circumstance.

34:40.324 --> 34:45.016
That's not true.

34:45.563 --> 34:47.766
Is Kimba Christian?

34:47.766 --> 34:50.467
He's head of our church.

34:50.469 --> 34:53.871
I saw a couple of nuns
and a priest when I got here.

34:53.873 --> 34:55.539
How do they feel about that?

34:55.540 --> 34:59.411
They went away,
but they're coming back now.

34:59.412 --> 35:01.946
There were some difficulties.

35:01.947 --> 35:03.247
I'll bet.

35:03.248 --> 35:05.649
But now that
President Kimba's name...

35:05.650 --> 35:07.351
is included
in the Lord's Prayer...

35:07.352 --> 35:12.044
there are no more problems.

35:20.865 --> 35:25.557
Is that where he lives?

35:28.672 --> 35:33.365
Details regarding the garrison
are not available to anyone.

35:43.754 --> 35:46.089
Stand there.

35:46.090 --> 35:48.091
Say "Cheese" for the scrapbook.

35:48.092 --> 35:51.428
The scrapbook?

35:51.429 --> 35:53.496
It's where
you keep your memories.

35:53.497 --> 35:55.532
And what's in yours?

35:55.533 --> 35:57.767
Not too much.

35:57.768 --> 36:00.770
Mr. Brown,
what are you really doing here?

36:00.771 --> 36:03.740
I told you.
I'm studying birds.

36:03.741 --> 36:06.676
Birds are smart. They migrate.

36:06.677 --> 36:08.109
They know when
things are gonna change...

36:08.110 --> 36:10.246
and they fly away.

36:10.247 --> 36:14.417
Why don't we have dinner?

36:14.418 --> 36:19.110
I'm late. Excuse me.

37:41.939 --> 37:46.631
Whoa! Wait a minute!

37:50.514 --> 37:55.206
Wait...

38:27.318 --> 38:31.755
Mr. Brown.

38:31.756 --> 38:36.448
Mr. Brown, can you hear me?

38:37.695 --> 38:39.129
OK.

38:39.130 --> 38:44.727
Mr. Brown, what are you
doing in Clarence?

38:44.769 --> 38:49.461
Water.

38:50.274 --> 38:55.075
Just tell me,
what are you doing in Clarence?

38:55.112 --> 38:59.804
Water.

39:10.393 --> 39:15.085
You are a naturalist,
are you not?

39:16.734 --> 39:21.426
Right.

39:25.309 --> 39:29.913
Why did you take
this picture of the garrison?

39:29.914 --> 39:34.250
She's pretty...

39:34.251 --> 39:38.944
isn't she?

39:52.470 --> 39:54.304
Mr. Brown...

39:54.305 --> 39:58.208
I am a doctor.

39:58.209 --> 40:01.211
I was told to clean your wounds.

40:01.212 --> 40:05.904
You are being deported.
Released.

40:06.384 --> 40:07.716
Why?

40:07.717 --> 40:09.718
One of the guards said...

40:09.719 --> 40:12.055
an Englishman
has been here all day...

40:12.056 --> 40:16.748
trying to talk with you,
interview you.

40:19.729 --> 40:25.861
He also filed a formal protest
with the Swiss consul.

40:25.903 --> 40:30.595
You have a friend, Mr. Brown.

40:40.418 --> 40:43.253
You a prisoner?

40:43.254 --> 40:45.588
Over four years.

40:45.589 --> 40:48.258
What'd you do?

40:48.259 --> 40:50.093
Bad judgment.

40:50.094 --> 40:54.786
I was a candidate for president.

40:57.767 --> 41:00.769
Dr. Okoye.

41:00.770 --> 41:02.872
How would you know that?

41:02.873 --> 41:06.775
The English... man...

41:06.776 --> 41:11.468
my friend.

41:14.719 --> 41:17.720
How long have I been here?

41:17.722 --> 41:21.391
Since yesterday.

41:21.392 --> 41:23.259
Why did they do this?

41:23.260 --> 41:27.230
Possibly for being
in the wrong company.

41:27.231 --> 41:32.190
The guard said
you were with Gabrielle Dexter.

41:32.236 --> 41:36.928
She's one of Kimba's mistresses.

41:43.914 --> 41:46.950
She... It was her?

41:46.951 --> 41:50.587
No.

41:50.588 --> 41:53.757
She's beautiful...

41:53.758 --> 41:56.426
not treacherous.

41:56.427 --> 41:58.695
Beauty is a currency.

41:58.696 --> 42:00.964
Unfortunately,
here in Zangaro...

42:00.965 --> 42:05.657
it only has value
in the presidential palace.

42:12.977 --> 42:17.080
Have some of these.
Painkillers.

42:17.081 --> 42:21.773
They'll help you.

42:25.356 --> 42:30.048
Okoye.

43:33.089 --> 43:36.426
Mr. Brown, can you tell us
why you were arrested?

43:36.427 --> 43:39.262
What were conditions like
inside the prison?

43:39.263 --> 43:41.997
Were you able to see
any other prisoners?

43:41.998 --> 43:45.268
Mr. Brown...

43:45.269 --> 43:47.669
they say Dr. Okoye is,
in fact, dead.

43:47.670 --> 43:50.606
Can you confirm that?

43:50.607 --> 43:54.943
Mr. Brown...

43:54.944 --> 43:59.779
you can't leave Zangaro without
your passport, asshole.

44:55.638 --> 44:59.242
No fractures,
but I don't understand...

44:59.243 --> 45:02.544
why the hell you didn't
see the doctor in Paris.

45:02.545 --> 45:04.247
Still got blood in the urine?

45:04.248 --> 45:07.049
Yeah.

45:07.050 --> 45:09.551
Four, five, six.

45:09.552 --> 45:12.554
Six healthy concussions
in the last three years.

45:12.555 --> 45:16.391
Two crushed disks,
two temporal fractures...

45:16.392 --> 45:21.695
one major pneumothorax,
perforated stomach...

45:21.731 --> 45:25.067
a hundred bouts with
unheard-of tropical diseases...

45:25.068 --> 45:27.736
a shitload of
arm and leg fractures...

45:27.737 --> 45:32.241
dyscrasia, dysentery,
dyspepsia, dysuria...

45:32.242 --> 45:33.709
dysphoria!

45:33.710 --> 45:35.912
Anything starting with "D"
I didn't get?

45:35.913 --> 45:38.915
Yeah... dead.

45:38.916 --> 45:43.608
Henry, you've got to get
some new jokes.

45:56.200 --> 45:58.600
I don't know what you got
planned for your old age...

45:58.601 --> 46:00.937
or who you figure
on spending it with...

46:00.938 --> 46:02.771
but I suggest you get at it.

46:02.772 --> 46:07.709
You've taken a lot of years
off the back end of your life.

46:13.217 --> 46:17.909
Thanks.

46:23.927 --> 46:26.628
Why didn't you call me
as soon as you got back?

46:26.629 --> 46:28.797
I was busy.
You got the money?

46:28.798 --> 46:33.490
No, no.
Don't take your coat off!

46:34.804 --> 46:37.473
There, that's for you.

46:37.474 --> 46:40.809
What does it mean?
Can Kimba be replaced?

46:40.810 --> 46:42.778
Just read the report.

46:42.779 --> 46:45.147
Is there any chance of a coup?

46:45.148 --> 46:46.748
No, not now.

46:46.749 --> 46:49.751
He don't trust his own army.

46:49.753 --> 46:52.488
Rations the bullets.

46:52.489 --> 46:54.823
He's crazy, see?

46:54.824 --> 46:57.226
So, unless there's some
guerrilla army building up...

46:57.227 --> 47:01.919
outside Zangaro
I don't know about, forget it.

47:04.268 --> 47:08.960
The people I represent
won't do business with a madman.

47:13.610 --> 47:18.302
He's obviously got to go.

47:19.983 --> 47:21.250
What'd you say?

47:21.251 --> 47:22.451
Could a well-trained...

47:22.452 --> 47:25.754
well-equipped
mercenary force succeed?

47:25.755 --> 47:29.024
- Succeed? At what?
- Replacing Kimba.

47:29.025 --> 47:31.994
What'd you find over there?
Oil? Diamonds?

47:31.995 --> 47:33.662
Could it succeed?

47:33.663 --> 47:37.099
Sure. Why not?

47:37.100 --> 47:39.368
How long would it take you...

47:39.369 --> 47:41.637
to get an operation
like that off the ground?

47:41.638 --> 47:43.906
Not me. You bought a recon.

47:43.907 --> 47:45.474
You got it. I'm paid.

47:45.475 --> 47:47.142
I'm done. Let's go!

47:47.143 --> 47:51.680
You're paid, Shannon,
but you're not finished.

47:51.681 --> 47:57.245
What would you want to get back
what they took from you?

47:57.287 --> 48:01.390
Would $100,000 cure cold feet?

48:01.391 --> 48:06.083
You got me mixed up
with somebody else.

48:17.907 --> 48:20.075
Hello. Operator.

48:20.076 --> 48:22.377
I'd like to make
a person-to-person.

48:22.378 --> 48:24.263
Name, please.

48:24.264 --> 48:26.114
Jessie Shannon.

48:26.116 --> 48:28.317
Jessie Shannon.
Area code, please.

48:28.318 --> 48:31.487
Area code 3-0-1.

48:31.488 --> 48:37.392
4-4-6-1-8-0-8.

48:37.427 --> 48:38.894
Who shall I say is calling?

48:38.895 --> 48:41.130
Just say Jessie.

48:41.131 --> 48:43.265
Will you hold on, please?

48:43.266 --> 48:45.200
Wait a minute.

48:45.201 --> 48:49.893
Don't tell me to hold on.
You hold on.

49:05.955 --> 49:08.891
Hello?

49:08.892 --> 49:13.584
Hello?

50:25.935 --> 50:28.670
Your move.

50:28.671 --> 50:30.172
God damn it!

50:30.173 --> 50:33.609
I'll get it, Dad. Sit down.

50:33.610 --> 50:35.644
Hard to keep
my bluffer's composure...

50:35.645 --> 50:36.912
with the damn phone ringing.

50:36.913 --> 50:39.747
Saved by the bell?
It's up to you.

50:39.748 --> 50:41.783
Jessie, it's me.

50:41.785 --> 50:46.477
Jamie?

50:52.729 --> 50:53.796
Where are you?

50:53.797 --> 50:58.632
The Bayview Motel... Hotel.

50:58.668 --> 51:01.637
It's a couple of blocks
from where the Starlight was.

51:01.638 --> 51:04.907
The Starlight burned down.

51:04.908 --> 51:06.241
Yeah, I know.

51:06.242 --> 51:10.935
That was two years ago.

51:12.015 --> 51:15.083
Jamie? You OK?

51:15.085 --> 51:16.417
Sure.

51:16.418 --> 51:21.089
What are you doing here?

51:21.091 --> 51:22.391
I want to see you...

51:22.392 --> 51:24.726
but...

51:24.727 --> 51:26.728
could you come down here?

51:26.729 --> 51:29.932
I don't want
to run into your father.

51:29.933 --> 51:33.101
Give me half an hour.

51:33.103 --> 51:34.269
Pair of jacks.

51:34.270 --> 51:37.606
Three jacks, pair of 9s.

51:37.607 --> 51:41.243
Jessie? Everything OK?

51:41.244 --> 51:43.378
Yeah, sure.

51:43.379 --> 51:45.214
Daddy,
I'm going out for a while.

51:45.215 --> 51:47.950
Could you get us
some more ice first?

51:47.951 --> 51:51.253
Yeah, sure.

51:51.254 --> 51:55.946
I'm out.

52:02.565 --> 52:05.466
I'll stop playing poker
when Carlos is off.

52:05.467 --> 52:07.201
You shouldn't be doing this.

52:07.202 --> 52:10.239
Don't be silly.
Go on and play your hand.

52:10.240 --> 52:11.707
Who called?

52:11.708 --> 52:12.975
Jamie.

52:12.976 --> 52:15.043
What did he want?

52:15.044 --> 52:17.745
- He wants to see me.
- You think that's wise?

52:17.746 --> 52:18.947
We were married,
for Christ's sake.

52:18.948 --> 52:20.782
If he wants to see me,
I want to see him.

52:20.784 --> 52:22.651
He's the same, Jessie.

52:22.652 --> 52:24.419
I know it. He hasn't changed.

52:24.421 --> 52:27.322
He's the same irresponsible
bastard you divorced!

52:27.323 --> 52:32.016
I didn't divorce him.
You did!

53:04.019 --> 53:08.712
- Did I scare you?
- Yes.

53:09.625 --> 53:13.762
It's cold.

53:13.763 --> 53:18.455
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

53:18.466 --> 53:21.368
You got skinny.

53:21.369 --> 53:23.570
You got on dark glasses.

53:23.571 --> 53:25.540
How come?

53:25.541 --> 53:28.409
I didn't want you
to see that...

53:28.411 --> 53:29.839
You were crying?

53:29.840 --> 53:32.280
Yeah.

53:32.281 --> 53:36.973
They do a great job.

53:54.402 --> 53:56.271
What do you want to do?

53:56.272 --> 53:57.839
You got time?

53:57.840 --> 54:01.176
Yeah. Some.

54:01.177 --> 54:05.869
- Let's eat.
- OK.

54:07.383 --> 54:11.051
I love you, Jessie.
That's what I'm here about.

54:11.052 --> 54:14.389
I want to move. West.

54:14.390 --> 54:17.759
Colorado, maybe Montana.

54:17.760 --> 54:22.397
I never been there,
but it's clean, it's open.

54:22.398 --> 54:29.997
I want to get a regular job.
Buy a house.

54:30.039 --> 54:33.408
What do you say?

54:33.409 --> 54:37.245
It's all the stuff
we used to talk about.

54:37.246 --> 54:41.938
I got the money
to get us started.

54:42.752 --> 54:44.918
When were you
thinking about going?

54:44.919 --> 54:46.920
Soon.

54:46.921 --> 54:51.259
I want to go right now.

54:51.260 --> 54:55.952
I want to go yesterday.

54:56.432 --> 55:01.124
- You haven't changed.
- No.

55:01.704 --> 55:04.204
Still the considerate planner.

55:04.205 --> 55:07.207
What do you say?

55:07.208 --> 55:11.900
Why don't we keep it
simple tonight?

55:14.717 --> 55:18.752
The way the tax situation
is out there...

55:18.753 --> 55:21.089
the land costs you
practically nothing.

55:21.090 --> 55:23.023
You put a house on it
and stay there.

55:23.024 --> 55:26.326
This guy tells me you can put
a trailer on the land.

55:26.327 --> 55:27.529
The government
doesn't know the difference.

55:27.530 --> 55:28.862
They don't care.

55:28.863 --> 55:30.198
You mad or what?

55:30.199 --> 55:32.766
You haven't
asked about my father.

55:32.767 --> 55:34.002
Yes, I did.

55:34.003 --> 55:35.904
I asked you to go away with me.

55:35.905 --> 55:37.539
If you'd said yes,
I'd know he was dead.

55:37.540 --> 55:39.174
It wasn't his fault.

55:39.175 --> 55:42.377
- Was it mine?
- As much as anybody's.

55:42.378 --> 55:44.411
Oh, please.
I didn't move out.

55:44.412 --> 55:46.915
You didn't try very hard
to stop me.

55:46.916 --> 55:49.316
Don't tell me that.
I didn't move out! You did.

55:49.317 --> 55:51.318
It's what you do, Jamie.
You fight wars.

55:51.319 --> 55:53.620
Not your wars, not our wars.
Anybody's wars.

55:53.621 --> 55:57.057
You get paid to kill people,
get your ass blown off.

55:57.058 --> 55:59.761
You would be great
in Colorado, out west.

55:59.762 --> 56:02.463
You could be a hired gun,
play cowboy.

56:02.464 --> 56:04.798
We're talking about your father.

56:04.799 --> 56:06.935
He didn't want you
married to anybody, did he?

56:06.936 --> 56:09.671
He needs somebody
he can depend on.

56:09.672 --> 56:10.904
Most drunks do.

56:10.905 --> 56:11.940
It's so easy for you.

56:11.941 --> 56:13.540
You come back
after two and a half years.

56:13.541 --> 56:15.510
You don't know
what's going on in my life.

56:15.511 --> 56:18.513
You just expect me to drop
everything and follow you!

56:18.514 --> 56:23.206
Wait a minute.

56:45.306 --> 56:49.943
Come with me, Jessie.

56:49.944 --> 56:53.947
By the time
he gets around to dying...

56:53.948 --> 56:58.641
there won't be
a dance left in you.

57:20.309 --> 57:25.001
Good-bye, Jamie.

58:24.807 --> 58:26.507
Endean.

58:26.508 --> 58:28.675
It's a bad time for me, Jamie.

58:28.676 --> 58:31.845
My sister's marriage
busted up...

58:31.846 --> 58:34.716
so she and the kids
move in with me.

58:34.717 --> 58:36.250
You know she don't work.

58:36.251 --> 58:37.651
Leave her some money.

58:37.652 --> 58:41.588
It's not the point.
She don't do well on her own.

58:41.589 --> 58:46.282
This is getting nowhere.

58:51.266 --> 58:52.766
No?

58:52.767 --> 58:57.459
No.

59:01.776 --> 59:05.279
I'll miss you.

59:05.280 --> 59:06.613
You'll make the next one.

59:06.614 --> 59:08.282
You bet your ass.

59:08.283 --> 59:12.975
I just gotta get
her and the kids off my back.

59:23.465 --> 59:28.157
Sturgis wants to know if
his car will be ready by 5:00.

59:33.074 --> 59:35.542
No.

59:35.543 --> 59:37.077
Forget it. Get Derek. Where is he?

59:37.078 --> 59:38.212
I got his number.

59:38.213 --> 59:40.248
And Michel. Call Paris.
Tell them to meet us...

59:40.249 --> 59:42.082
at the Great Eastern Hotel,
Tuesday.

59:42.083 --> 59:44.485
You believe that shit
Terry gave you?

59:44.486 --> 59:46.220
What do you care?
It's his story.

59:46.221 --> 59:48.288
That candy ass is scared
of getting greased.

59:48.289 --> 59:50.724
I got a better story
with Miranda being pregnant.

59:50.725 --> 59:53.327
You want to stay home, too?

59:53.328 --> 59:57.865
No.

59:57.866 --> 01:00:02.558
Watching her get fat
is gonna be nauseating.

01:00:09.144 --> 01:00:12.045
I wouldn't waste any time
getting our money in the bank.

01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:13.881
Putting it all together
in 40 days...

01:00:13.882 --> 01:00:16.818
will be tough enough.

01:00:16.819 --> 01:00:20.154
Right.
Don't forget the insurance.

01:00:20.155 --> 01:00:25.855
It's 100,000.
Each of us, yes.

01:00:25.894 --> 01:00:29.396
Over here, it's Mrs...
You got a pencil?

01:00:29.397 --> 01:00:34.859
Drew Blakeley. L-e-y.

01:00:34.903 --> 01:00:39.738
5-5-2 East 7-4...

01:00:43.745 --> 01:00:45.078
I'll give you the name...

01:00:45.079 --> 01:00:48.749
of the European
beneficiaries later.

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:50.918
For me?

01:00:50.919 --> 01:00:55.611
Hey, you, what's your name?

01:00:57.025 --> 01:01:00.360
Express leaving Platform 13...

01:01:00.361 --> 01:01:06.925
will stop at Rugby,
Leicester, Loughborough...

01:01:06.969 --> 01:01:11.661
Nottingham, and Sheffield.

01:01:16.077 --> 01:01:20.769
Jamie, Michel's here.

01:01:31.493 --> 01:01:34.561
Don't go by this.
Takes longer to go from here.

01:01:34.562 --> 01:01:37.064
That'll give you a better idea
of what I'm talking about.

01:01:37.065 --> 01:01:38.732
These are good.
You didn't take them.

01:01:38.733 --> 01:01:40.234
No. They were a gift.

01:01:40.235 --> 01:01:43.070
Michel, you want a beer?
Derek?

01:01:43.071 --> 01:01:45.439
What is this, coffee or tea?
It's terrible.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.740
He al ways home?

01:01:46.741 --> 01:01:50.077
He will be. Zangaro has
an independence day coming up.

01:01:50.078 --> 01:01:51.345
How long do we hold it?

01:01:51.346 --> 01:01:53.580
As long as it takes to fly...

01:01:53.581 --> 01:01:55.582
the new president
in from the border.

01:01:55.583 --> 01:01:57.251
Who is it going to be?

01:01:57.252 --> 01:01:59.753
- Nixon.
- That's not funny, Drew.

01:01:59.754 --> 01:02:01.054
Come on, Jamie.

01:02:01.055 --> 01:02:02.623
Punch up your brief
and try a few jokes.

01:02:02.624 --> 01:02:04.292
I spoke to Jinja.

01:02:04.293 --> 01:02:07.127
He'll train as many
Zangaran exiles as he can.

01:02:07.128 --> 01:02:08.762
They won't be worth a shit.

01:02:08.763 --> 01:02:10.864
Jinja's OK. They'll be ready.

01:02:10.865 --> 01:02:11.899
They'll fight.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.333
What do we do with Kimba?

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:15.903
Just give him over
to the new government.

01:02:15.904 --> 01:02:18.306
He gets loose, forget it.

01:02:18.307 --> 01:02:20.641
I'm hungry.
Anybody want a pizza?

01:02:20.642 --> 01:02:22.342
I'll have a cheese roll.

01:02:22.343 --> 01:02:24.645
I'd like a treacle pudding.

01:02:24.646 --> 01:02:25.679
A what?

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.982
With a lot of sour sauce...

01:02:28.983 --> 01:02:30.585
Split a pepperoni with me.

01:02:30.586 --> 01:02:35.278
Anybody want to know
how we're doing this?

01:02:56.845 --> 01:02:59.446
There's no way we'll do it
without him sticking us up.

01:02:59.447 --> 01:03:02.115
That's the way it's gotta be.
He's the best.

01:03:02.117 --> 01:03:04.985
There's no delis in London.
I walked 15 blocks.

01:03:04.986 --> 01:03:06.286
What do you want, room service?

01:03:06.287 --> 01:03:08.856
- Who's got the bullets?
- Hackett, in London.

01:03:08.857 --> 01:03:11.525
- He's still in business?
- Far as I know.

01:03:11.526 --> 01:03:13.894
Tough part's
gonna be the freighter.

01:03:13.895 --> 01:03:15.896
It's gotta be clean, registered.

01:03:15.897 --> 01:03:17.632
It won't be a bargain basement.

01:03:17.633 --> 01:03:20.567
- We've only got 40 days.
- Thirty-eight.

01:03:20.568 --> 01:03:22.736
Three-five launchers,
detonators, grenades.

01:03:22.737 --> 01:03:25.572
- Baker still in Paris?
- He was in Malaga.

01:03:25.573 --> 01:03:29.009
He sold some shitty rifles
to a bunch of Croatians.

01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:30.911
They cut a piece
of his stomach out.

01:03:30.912 --> 01:03:33.013
Ought to be
real honest these days.

01:03:33.014 --> 01:03:35.082
Nine-millimeter quad.

01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:36.583
Baker as well.

01:03:36.584 --> 01:03:39.586
He's got good contacts
in Yugoslavia.

01:03:39.587 --> 01:03:41.255
Who fixes the end users?

01:03:41.256 --> 01:03:43.924
I see Benny Lambert
in Paris tomorrow.

01:03:43.925 --> 01:03:45.926
What's it gonna be?

01:03:45.927 --> 01:03:51.388
M-16s, Armalites, Uzis, AK-47s?

01:03:51.433 --> 01:03:54.101
You want I should call Boucher?

01:03:54.102 --> 01:03:56.403
We should let Derek call him.

01:03:56.404 --> 01:04:01.096
I cut his fucking throat once.

01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:06.280
All clear
on what we gotta get done?

01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:09.283
Leave messages for me here
if you have to.

01:04:09.284 --> 01:04:11.985
Give me names, dates...

01:04:11.986 --> 01:04:14.288
I'll see to it
the money gets paid.

01:04:14.289 --> 01:04:15.889
And run hard deals.

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:17.224
These guys put up
a million dollars.

01:04:17.225 --> 01:04:20.661
Let's make sure there's change.
We ought to keep it.

01:04:20.662 --> 01:04:24.898
Certainly.

01:04:24.899 --> 01:04:27.034
Everybody goes home.

01:04:27.035 --> 01:04:31.727
Seconded.

01:04:46.354 --> 01:04:50.757
I can get you
an end user's certificate.

01:04:50.759 --> 01:04:54.595
My contact returns from Belgrade
the beginning of next week.

01:04:54.596 --> 01:04:56.763
- How much?
- 15,000.

01:04:56.765 --> 01:04:58.599
Pounds, francs, dollars?

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.968
- Pounds.
- Francs.

01:05:00.969 --> 01:05:05.038
- Dollars.
- 10,000.

01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:09.732
Done.

01:05:12.113 --> 01:05:16.805
Benny, we're in a hurry.
Eat later.

01:06:57.886 --> 01:07:01.488
I honestly do not know
what I can get.

01:07:01.489 --> 01:07:05.659
The demand for munitions
is staggering right now.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.327
There could be delays.

01:07:07.328 --> 01:07:09.163
We are short on time.

01:07:09.164 --> 01:07:11.834
We are short on merchandise.

01:07:11.835 --> 01:07:14.101
Nine-millimeter quad.

01:07:14.102 --> 01:07:18.794
Three weeks' delivery
in Valencia.

01:07:19.774 --> 01:07:24.466
- And?
- That's all I need from you.

01:07:25.613 --> 01:07:28.282
$1,500... 1,000 rounds...

01:07:28.283 --> 01:07:32.975
20% surcharge for an end user.

01:07:33.121 --> 01:07:35.122
You can do better than that.

01:07:35.123 --> 01:07:39.815
10% for export license,
customs clearance.

01:07:39.962 --> 01:07:44.654
If you're trying to stick us,
I can go down the street.

01:08:09.157 --> 01:08:13.849
Shall we try again?

01:08:39.287 --> 01:08:41.622
Do it that way,
but I have to be sure...

01:08:41.622 --> 01:08:43.457
the money will be
in his account tomorrow.

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:44.658
I assure you it will be.

01:08:44.658 --> 01:08:46.794
I'll have several more
transactions for you...

01:08:46.795 --> 01:08:48.127
over the next couple of weeks.

01:08:48.129 --> 01:08:49.296
Be our pleasure.

01:08:49.298 --> 01:08:51.131
Thank you, Nigel.

01:08:51.131 --> 01:08:55.823
Good afternoon, sir.

01:08:58.139 --> 01:08:59.640
Hey, Keith!

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.475
Keith Brown!

01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:04.978
Message for Mr. Brown
from General Kimba.

01:09:04.979 --> 01:09:07.648
I'll be damned.
How are you?

01:09:07.649 --> 01:09:09.483
I'm fair to lousy.

01:09:09.484 --> 01:09:12.586
You seem to have
improved considerably.

01:09:12.587 --> 01:09:17.279
- I'm OK.
- Good.

01:09:17.926 --> 01:09:21.428
Was the film any use to you?

01:09:21.429 --> 01:09:24.598
- Yeah.
- Good. Good.

01:09:24.599 --> 01:09:29.291
Glad to be of help.

01:09:29.604 --> 01:09:33.106
I don't suppose you'd have...

01:09:33.108 --> 01:09:34.441
Can I buy you a drink?

01:09:34.442 --> 01:09:37.044
What a good idea.
I thought you'd never ask.

01:09:37.045 --> 01:09:39.779
So... what's your name,
Mr. Brown?

01:09:39.781 --> 01:09:42.115
Shannon... James.

01:09:42.117 --> 01:09:44.451
That's an improvement
on the other one.

01:09:44.452 --> 01:09:46.453
What are you doing in London?

01:09:46.453 --> 01:09:48.622
I've got to see some people.

01:09:48.622 --> 01:09:49.790
What's the message?

01:09:49.791 --> 01:09:53.627
- Message?
- Kimba.

01:09:53.627 --> 01:09:55.462
"Come back, all is forgiven. "

01:09:55.463 --> 01:09:56.897
Did you get to see him?

01:09:56.898 --> 01:09:59.299
After your ruckus
with the soldiers...

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.636
one of their lot washed up
in the canal with a broken neck.

01:10:02.637 --> 01:10:04.638
You wouldn't know
anything about that?

01:10:04.639 --> 01:10:07.141
No.

01:10:07.142 --> 01:10:10.644
Kimba's paranoia
took a jump after that.

01:10:10.645 --> 01:10:12.579
He wouldn't see anyone,
including me.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:16.083
There were nine executions
the next day.

01:10:16.084 --> 01:10:17.718
Four of them were women.

01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:19.920
I didn't get that piece, either.

01:10:19.921 --> 01:10:22.089
I was being escorted
to the airport at the time.

01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:25.425
I got thrown out of the country,
thank you very much.

01:10:25.427 --> 01:10:27.427
Dexter's daughter OK?

01:10:27.429 --> 01:10:29.596
Funny you should mention her.

01:10:29.597 --> 01:10:32.266
The day I was leaving,
she actually talked to me.

01:10:32.267 --> 01:10:35.435
She asked me
what I knew about you.

01:10:35.437 --> 01:10:39.606
Pathetically little,
I had to confess.

01:10:39.607 --> 01:10:41.942
Did you get your film
on the air?

01:10:41.943 --> 01:10:44.611
Last week.

01:10:44.612 --> 01:10:46.780
How'd you make out?

01:10:46.781 --> 01:10:51.912
"Behind these very walls,
just a few feet from me...

01:10:51.953 --> 01:10:55.789
"resides Africa's
most brutal dictator.

01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:57.291
"It is rumored...

01:10:57.292 --> 01:10:59.460
"There are
conflicting reports...

01:10:59.461 --> 01:11:03.797
"High-ranking sources who
have asked not to be named...

01:11:03.798 --> 01:11:06.633
"say, 'Who knows'... "

01:11:06.634 --> 01:11:10.437
Five million viewers switched
over to the Miss World contest.

01:11:10.438 --> 01:11:13.674
That's too bad.

01:11:13.675 --> 01:11:17.077
Yeah.

01:11:17.078 --> 01:11:18.679
When are you going back?

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.648
You gonna ask a lot of
questions I can't answer?

01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:24.451
I stuck out my neck for you,
for Christ's sake.

01:11:24.452 --> 01:11:26.119
You owe me a little more
than a drink.

01:11:26.121 --> 01:11:27.154
You ought to watch your step.

01:11:27.155 --> 01:11:29.022
What I do is
none of your business.

01:11:29.023 --> 01:11:33.716
That's a matter of opinion.

01:11:36.564 --> 01:11:38.599
Is there a number
I can reach you?

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.292
You'll get in trouble.

01:11:43.471 --> 01:11:45.005
I'm not in town long.

01:11:45.006 --> 01:11:49.309
Fancy that.

01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:54.003
- It was good to see you.
- Likewise.

01:13:05.154 --> 01:13:07.654
- Can I suggest something?
- Fire away.

01:13:07.655 --> 01:13:10.991
Which shells do you use?
That's very good.

01:13:10.992 --> 01:13:12.594
You put the right mix
in this thing...

01:13:12.595 --> 01:13:15.263
and its killing potential
is fantastic.

01:13:15.264 --> 01:13:17.599
Your operation is an assault,
I suspect.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.602
The XM 18 is effective
up to 400 meters.

01:13:20.603 --> 01:13:22.771
If you load it in
a well-thought-out sequence...

01:13:22.772 --> 01:13:24.072
it's devastating.

01:13:24.073 --> 01:13:27.275
For instance, first
you use two rounds flares...

01:13:27.276 --> 01:13:30.078
then a couple gas,
improvise with the rest...

01:13:30.079 --> 01:13:32.614
fragmentation, grenades...

01:13:32.615 --> 01:13:35.949
tactical,
antitank, antipersonnel...

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:38.453
It's what we in the business
call a mixed-fruit pudding.

01:13:38.454 --> 01:13:40.255
What would you say
is the rate of fire?

01:13:40.256 --> 01:13:42.122
Eighteen rounds in five seconds.

01:13:42.123 --> 01:13:44.124
It's the ultimate
in killing technology.

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:47.295
It's light, accurate,
and mobile.

01:13:47.296 --> 01:13:49.731
Ever been in combat yourself?

01:13:49.732 --> 01:13:52.267
I'm a Canadian.

01:13:52.268 --> 01:13:56.136
12, 18, 26 for the Uzis
and the XM 18s.

01:13:56.137 --> 01:13:57.806
You got a ship?

01:13:57.807 --> 01:14:01.309
Not yet. I'll get the name
to you when I do.

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:03.745
Fine. Total,
including my percentage...

01:14:03.746 --> 01:14:06.815
31,5. Let's make it 32.

01:14:06.816 --> 01:14:09.082
31,5. Here's 15.

01:14:09.084 --> 01:14:10.417
You get another 10...

01:14:10.418 --> 01:14:14.521
when I see the stuff
crated and ready to go.

01:14:14.522 --> 01:14:17.357
The balance...

01:14:17.358 --> 01:14:22.051
when the ship sails.

01:14:33.209 --> 01:14:35.709
It's not a question
of where she's been, mister.

01:14:35.710 --> 01:14:37.711
She's a great ship.

01:14:37.712 --> 01:14:41.049
Haifa, Gibraltar...

01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:44.384
Tangiers, Dakar, Monrovia,
you name it.

01:14:44.385 --> 01:14:47.454
- Single hold?
- Aye, twin hatches.

01:14:47.455 --> 01:14:49.990
We need you and your crew.

01:14:49.991 --> 01:14:53.495
My crew's choosy, mister.

01:14:53.496 --> 01:14:58.188
Double for your crew
and 10,000 for yourself.

01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:01.001
I'll need to talk to them.

01:15:01.002 --> 01:15:03.505
We haven't got time
for a ballot.

01:15:03.506 --> 01:15:06.006
I count the votes, mister.

01:15:06.007 --> 01:15:08.842
What is your cargo?

01:15:08.843 --> 01:15:10.512
It's not peanuts for Monrovia.

01:15:10.513 --> 01:15:12.846
Peanuts is rats, mister.

01:15:12.847 --> 01:15:16.518
Every kind of cargo's
got its own kind of trouble.

01:15:16.519 --> 01:15:19.621
What is your cargo?

01:15:19.622 --> 01:15:24.314
Just trouble.

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:31.865
The ship heads
for Toulon tonight.

01:15:31.866 --> 01:15:35.370
I'll call Michel,
tell him to get on the road.

01:15:35.371 --> 01:15:37.539
Hackett's hardware's
in Valencia.

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:38.540
Good.

01:15:38.541 --> 01:15:40.707
I gotta get something to eat.

01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:42.210
I got a meeting.

01:15:42.211 --> 01:15:46.903
Endean's introducing me
to Zangaro's next president.

01:15:47.048 --> 01:15:49.551
Whoop-de-doo.
Pack your White House manners.

01:15:49.552 --> 01:15:50.717
Do me a favor.

01:15:50.718 --> 01:15:52.419
There's a guy named North
following me.

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.054
He's OK, but he's a reporter.

01:15:54.055 --> 01:15:56.056
- Oh, Jesus.
- Don't hurt him.

01:15:56.057 --> 01:15:59.059
Don't kill him,
but discourage him.

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.562
If he finds out
what we're up to...

01:16:00.563 --> 01:16:05.255
he'll have it on the 6:00 news.

01:16:59.687 --> 01:17:01.189
Hello.

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:02.523
Hello.

01:17:02.524 --> 01:17:04.359
I'm with the Boy Scouts
of America.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.692
I'm sorry, I don't...

01:17:05.693 --> 01:17:10.264
Right.

01:17:10.265 --> 01:17:12.634
Look out!

01:17:12.635 --> 01:17:15.203
Go on! Jump the wall!

01:17:15.204 --> 01:17:19.896
Jump! You idiot!

01:17:29.485 --> 01:17:31.985
Come on, move it!
You're going with me.

01:17:31.986 --> 01:17:35.823
Move it! Taxi!

01:17:35.824 --> 01:17:40.516
Come on!
This man needs a doctor!

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:52.272
When Zangaro was fighting
for independence...

01:17:52.273 --> 01:17:55.576
he was as much
a national hero as Kimba.

01:17:55.577 --> 01:17:59.514
We fought in the bush together.

01:17:59.515 --> 01:18:00.848
Brothers.

01:18:00.849 --> 01:18:03.685
Then when he makes
himself president...

01:18:03.686 --> 01:18:06.987
his first official business
was to put a price on my head.

01:18:06.988 --> 01:18:10.525
When he left the country,
some soldiers went with him.

01:18:10.526 --> 01:18:13.026
We've been together
a long time now.

01:18:13.027 --> 01:18:15.797
Excellent fighters.

01:18:15.798 --> 01:18:17.564
Very loyal.

01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:21.703
I have selected
the best of them for you.

01:18:21.704 --> 01:18:23.971
There'll be twenty-four
waiting in Freetown.

01:18:23.972 --> 01:18:25.105
They're very good.

01:18:25.106 --> 01:18:27.141
They'll die for Zangaro.

01:18:27.142 --> 01:18:29.209
Be more help to me
if they fight.

01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:31.311
If there is one who doesn't,
I'll take his head...

01:18:31.312 --> 01:18:33.081
and mount it
on the palace gates.

01:18:33.082 --> 01:18:35.649
You and your brother...

01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:37.851
have the same easy way
of doing business.

01:18:37.852 --> 01:18:42.544
Olu Kimba did not do business.

01:18:44.492 --> 01:18:49.294
So now, Sekou Bobi
will be president.

01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:52.666
He wants to be God...

01:18:52.667 --> 01:18:57.359
I want to be rich.

01:18:59.507 --> 01:19:03.745
Shannon, why don't you brief us
on your strike plan?

01:19:03.746 --> 01:19:07.514
You coming along?

01:19:07.515 --> 01:19:09.183
There's nothing
you need to know about.

01:19:09.184 --> 01:19:10.684
The colonel's
due at the garrison...

01:19:10.685 --> 01:19:12.786
at 0500 hours on the 25th.

01:19:12.787 --> 01:19:15.455
That's 5 a. m.
You're a minute late...

01:19:15.457 --> 01:19:17.090
I give the whole thing
back to Kimba.

01:19:17.092 --> 01:19:19.827
You're working for me, Shannon.

01:19:19.828 --> 01:19:21.161
You could fire me.

01:19:21.162 --> 01:19:25.854
If anything comes up,
I'll be in touch.

01:19:27.402 --> 01:19:30.571
Mr. Shannon,
when I am president...

01:19:30.572 --> 01:19:35.264
it would be to your advantage
to be my friend.

01:19:36.411 --> 01:19:41.144
Mr. Endean could tell you
what a generous friend I am.

01:19:41.182 --> 01:19:43.951
I got all the friends
I can handle right now.

01:19:43.952 --> 01:19:47.454
Forget about your soldiers.

01:19:47.455 --> 01:19:52.147
I got my own.
Just don't be late.

01:19:55.497 --> 01:19:57.165
Don't worry.

01:19:57.166 --> 01:20:01.858
He's expendable.

01:20:07.509 --> 01:20:12.201
To the hotel.

01:22:02.323 --> 01:22:03.991
I wanted to
waste the bastard...

01:22:03.992 --> 01:22:05.659
but I figured
you had to talk to him.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.861
Just so we understand
each other, you're dead.

01:22:08.862 --> 01:22:11.331
Give me straight answers,
and I'll keep it painless.

01:22:11.332 --> 01:22:16.025
Go fuck yourself.

01:22:22.776 --> 01:22:23.776
Oh, no!

01:22:23.777 --> 01:22:28.469
No. No!

01:22:31.119 --> 01:22:33.453
Who's paying you?

01:22:33.455 --> 01:22:35.122
Who's paying you?

01:22:35.123 --> 01:22:38.459
Same as pays you.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.461
What'd he have you doing?

01:22:40.462 --> 01:22:42.996
Keeping track of
your whole operation.

01:22:42.997 --> 01:22:45.632
He tell you to kill North?

01:22:45.633 --> 01:22:48.267
He was a journalist.

01:22:48.268 --> 01:22:50.304
He'd have blown it for you.

01:22:50.305 --> 01:22:53.974
Did Endean tell you to kill him?

01:22:53.975 --> 01:22:58.667
I make my own decisions.

01:23:07.122 --> 01:23:10.324
So the bloody fool said,
"Don't bother to wrap it.

01:23:10.325 --> 01:23:15.017
"I'll eat it on the way home. "

01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:18.599
The measure of a man
is in his appetites.

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.668
The more you consume,
the more you are.

01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:24.404
Do you measure ladies
in the same way?

01:23:24.405 --> 01:23:27.508
No. Ladies are not measured.
They are judged.

01:23:27.509 --> 01:23:29.977
Oh, very good.

01:23:29.978 --> 01:23:32.279
Maybe one of you ladies
would like...

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:34.313
to come to my palace
in Zangaro, huh?

01:23:34.314 --> 01:23:36.016
How many bedrooms do you have?

01:23:36.017 --> 01:23:39.485
Caroline and I had thought
we'd like to visit your country.

01:23:39.486 --> 01:23:41.054
I'll get it downstairs.

01:23:41.055 --> 01:23:42.923
Maybe you both can come?

01:23:42.924 --> 01:23:47.616
With your appetites,
you'd need us both.

01:23:54.936 --> 01:23:56.103
Hello.

01:23:56.104 --> 01:23:57.938
Yes, good evening, sir.

01:23:57.939 --> 01:24:01.774
It's a very bad connection.

01:24:01.775 --> 01:24:06.467
He's already signed
all the agreements.

01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:13.142
All the papers will be dated
once he's in power.

01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:22.583
Hello? Can you hear me?

01:24:22.730 --> 01:24:25.466
What?

01:24:25.467 --> 01:24:27.301
Manson Industries...

01:24:27.302 --> 01:24:30.137
will have the exclusive
mineral and mining rights...

01:24:30.138 --> 01:24:34.830
for all Zangaro.

01:24:35.977 --> 01:24:37.478
No.

01:24:37.479 --> 01:24:42.171
No, he's no idea
what's at stake.

01:24:43.318 --> 01:24:45.818
I promise.

01:24:45.819 --> 01:24:50.511
I don't believe
he can even spell "Platinum. "

01:24:51.993 --> 01:24:56.685
Things are going very well, sir.

01:25:01.436 --> 01:25:04.138
Valencia. On the 18th.

01:25:04.139 --> 01:25:05.906
Subject to
technical difficulties.

01:25:05.907 --> 01:25:07.106
It can happen.

01:25:07.107 --> 01:25:11.799
But you got to be there.

01:25:17.751 --> 01:25:19.720
Want a drink?

01:25:19.721 --> 01:25:21.854
No.

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:26.425
You don't need
to worry about me, mister.

01:25:26.426 --> 01:25:31.119
But I do.

01:25:59.159 --> 01:26:04.496
Look, Shannon,
if something goes wrong...

01:26:04.531 --> 01:26:08.402
I lose my license.

01:26:08.403 --> 01:26:11.370
I don't care about any of this.

01:26:11.371 --> 01:26:16.064
I want that stuff
on board tomorrow.

01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:22.381
What is it?

01:26:22.382 --> 01:26:25.651
It hasn't left Madrid yet.

01:26:25.652 --> 01:26:27.988
We made a deal.

01:26:27.989 --> 01:26:31.390
It's too risky now.

01:26:31.391 --> 01:26:33.292
If they check
your end user certificate...

01:26:33.293 --> 01:26:37.986
you're finished.

01:26:38.098 --> 01:26:39.333
Cancel the order.

01:26:39.334 --> 01:26:44.026
Want to give me my money back?

01:26:47.609 --> 01:26:52.301
Make the call.

01:27:20.475 --> 01:27:21.742
Brown.

01:27:21.743 --> 01:27:26.345
Sir, that's one of my seamen.

01:27:26.346 --> 01:27:28.282
Want to see your papers.

01:27:28.283 --> 01:27:32.975
Why do you need eight men
in such a small ship?

01:27:39.961 --> 01:27:41.962
Seamen's card?

01:27:41.963 --> 01:27:44.096
I left it with
my buddy's gear aboard ship.

01:27:44.097 --> 01:27:47.166
He's an employee of the company.

01:27:47.167 --> 01:27:48.568
Missed his ship in Brindisi.

01:27:48.569 --> 01:27:52.306
He's coming with us to Malta
and going on to Telakia.

01:27:52.307 --> 01:27:56.999
Right.

01:28:38.019 --> 01:28:40.052
That last port.

01:28:40.053 --> 01:28:44.746
Last place
anybody will check the hold.

01:28:46.593 --> 01:28:51.285
You did good back there.

01:29:55.629 --> 01:30:00.321
Whose war are you gonna fight?

01:30:32.099 --> 01:30:36.791
Out!

01:30:47.980 --> 01:30:51.117
Squad, attention!

01:30:51.118 --> 01:30:54.687
Do you think
these geezers can fight?

01:30:54.688 --> 01:30:57.557
Strictly bush league.

01:30:57.558 --> 01:31:01.526
Never seen anything newer
than bolt-action Enfields.

01:31:01.527 --> 01:31:04.796
I hope they don't blow the
bottom out of this tub...

01:31:04.797 --> 01:31:09.489
when you give them the Uzis.

01:31:13.474 --> 01:31:17.642
Reporting, Captain.

01:31:17.643 --> 01:31:22.336
Let's go.

01:31:37.631 --> 01:31:40.333
All right.
Pay attention!

01:31:40.334 --> 01:31:42.734
We'll fire a few rounds,
show you how they pull.

01:31:42.735 --> 01:31:45.338
Now, they tend to pull up
and to the right.

01:31:45.339 --> 01:31:46.706
I'll give you an example.

01:31:46.707 --> 01:31:51.399
Squad!

01:31:52.179 --> 01:31:56.871
Ready!

01:31:59.051 --> 01:32:03.744
Fire!

01:32:08.462 --> 01:32:13.154
Squad, attention!

01:32:13.399 --> 01:32:18.091
Stand easy.

01:32:19.405 --> 01:32:24.097
Cuban.

01:32:30.851 --> 01:32:33.184
We'll be on the beach at 0400.

01:32:33.186 --> 01:32:35.555
Sentries are spotted for you,
so be quick.

01:32:35.556 --> 01:32:38.691
Once the firefight starts,
we got only 15 minutes.

01:32:38.692 --> 01:32:40.860
If it goes over that...

01:32:40.861 --> 01:32:43.094
I don't want to even
think about it.

01:32:43.095 --> 01:32:45.530
- How long to the bridge?
- About 10 minutes.

01:32:45.531 --> 01:32:49.367
If none of you have worked
with hired soldiers before...

01:32:49.368 --> 01:32:51.369
we handle tactics. That's all.

01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:53.673
We give you support fire,
bring up the rear...

01:32:53.674 --> 01:32:56.709
but it's your fight.
You gotta do it.

01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:58.711
You gotta be alive to get paid.

01:32:58.712 --> 01:33:01.813
- Everybody understand?
- Yes.

01:33:01.814 --> 01:33:06.506
Kimba! Kick his ass!

01:33:06.819 --> 01:33:09.055
Hold here...

01:33:09.056 --> 01:33:11.057
north of the border
for two hours.

01:33:11.058 --> 01:33:13.326
Then you start southeast
toward the coast.

01:33:13.327 --> 01:33:15.328
End up right there at 0330.

01:33:15.329 --> 01:33:17.829
- No patrol boats?
- I said that.

01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:19.999
After you drop us,
stay there till we get back.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.499
If they start tearing us up...

01:33:21.501 --> 01:33:23.336
it's the only place
we got to run to.

01:33:23.337 --> 01:33:24.869
I'll be there.

01:33:24.871 --> 01:33:27.505
If you're not,
hope to hell I got killed.

01:33:27.507 --> 01:33:32.199
Send it.

01:33:53.033 --> 01:33:57.725
- Right on schedule.
- Let's go to work.

01:34:12.084 --> 01:34:16.777
Let's go.

01:34:18.291 --> 01:34:22.983
Move it. Pick it up.

01:38:08.688 --> 01:38:13.380
Hurry.

01:40:13.813 --> 01:40:16.147
You didn't tell them
we were coming?

01:40:16.148 --> 01:40:20.841
Derek, get over there.
Close it.

01:43:40.886 --> 01:43:43.587
One CQ.

01:43:43.588 --> 01:43:45.557
- Two CQ.
- Three CQ.

01:43:45.558 --> 01:43:50.250
Four CQ.

01:44:48.087 --> 01:44:52.779
Squad!

01:45:18.116 --> 01:45:22.808
Let's check them.

01:45:34.467 --> 01:45:39.159
Get! Get! Get!

01:47:28.079 --> 01:47:30.080
What the hell happened to support fire...

01:47:30.081 --> 01:47:34.774
and bringing up the rear?

01:47:41.661 --> 01:47:46.353
Ready? Come on!

01:51:34.093 --> 01:51:35.594
The Ministry of Works...

01:51:35.595 --> 01:51:37.929
will have to start
clearing up tomorrow.

01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:39.931
Shannon's got him
in the main building.

01:51:39.932 --> 01:51:44.624
There.

01:52:23.643 --> 01:52:25.810
You're late!

01:52:25.811 --> 01:52:30.504
What the hell's going on?
Who's that?

01:52:30.816 --> 01:52:35.509
Colonel Bobi,
you are under arrest.

01:52:36.088 --> 01:52:40.781
President Okoye.

01:52:45.765 --> 01:52:47.432
I am president.

01:52:47.433 --> 01:52:49.067
You're nobody.

01:52:49.068 --> 01:52:51.136
Shannon, get him out of here.

01:52:51.137 --> 01:52:54.039
This whole country's
bought and paid for.

01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:58.732
You have to buy it
all over again.
