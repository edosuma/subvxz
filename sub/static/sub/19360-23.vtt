WEBVTT

00:08.307 --> 00:09.874
This week on Vice:

00:09.909 --> 00:12.809
the rise of a dictator in Venezuela.

00:14.713 --> 00:17.214
- That's a member of parliament?
- Yeah.

00:23.522 --> 00:26.656
There is no fear anymore.
This is a citizens' revolution.

00:26.691 --> 00:28.225
And you can feel it on the streets.

00:32.764 --> 00:34.864
Today the instructions
are for all the protesters

00:34.900 --> 00:36.933
to stay in separate
groups across the city,

00:36.968 --> 00:39.803
to make it harder for the
National Guard to break them up.

00:50.448 --> 00:51.914
Go, go, go!

00:54.752 --> 00:56.252
We are not animals!

01:07.731 --> 01:10.298
In recent weeks, the crisis in Venezuela

01:10.334 --> 01:12.033
has frequently been in the news.

01:12.069 --> 01:13.635
This resource-rich nation,

01:13.671 --> 01:16.071
with the largest proven
oil reserves on Earth,

01:16.106 --> 01:18.573
is on the verge of total collapse.

01:18.608 --> 01:21.176
Hyperinflation,
widespread food shortages,

01:21.211 --> 01:23.345
and one of the highest
murder rates in the world,

01:23.380 --> 01:27.349
has fueled almost continuous
daily protests across the country.

01:27.384 --> 01:31.152
Much of the anger is directed
at President Nicolás Maduro

01:31.188 --> 01:33.421
and his ruling socialist party.

01:39.729 --> 01:42.262
Critics say Maduro's
authoritarian regime

01:42.298 --> 01:44.164
is guilty of large-scale corruption

01:44.200 --> 01:47.067
and involvement in narcotrafficking.

01:47.103 --> 01:48.168
Earlier this year,

01:48.204 --> 01:50.170
President Maduro announced his intention

01:50.206 --> 01:52.373
to rewrite the nation's constitution,

01:52.408 --> 01:53.974
in what is widely seen

01:54.010 --> 01:56.543
as an attempt to consolidate power.

01:56.578 --> 01:59.446
With tensions escalating,
Vice sent both Suroosh Alvi

01:59.482 --> 02:02.549
and Ben Anderson to
Caracas to cover the crisis.

02:15.637 --> 02:18.237
So, in Caracas now, they're protesting

02:18.273 --> 02:20.740
four out of the seven days of the week.

02:20.776 --> 02:23.643
There is no fear anymore.
This is a citizens' revolution.

02:23.679 --> 02:25.044
And you can feel it out in the streets.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.114
People aren't afraid.
They're ready to fight.

03:16.329 --> 03:18.195
Since the anti-government uprisings

03:18.231 --> 03:19.764
exploded this past spring,

03:19.799 --> 03:22.566
Venezuelans have been
demonstrating in the streets

03:22.602 --> 03:24.335
for over a hundred days.

03:24.370 --> 03:28.405
More than 100 have been killed
and thousands more injured.

03:30.743 --> 03:33.010
And the more the protesters
defy the authorities,

03:33.045 --> 03:36.547
the more aggressive the police
get trying to break them.

03:46.892 --> 03:49.826
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know what's happening.

03:59.071 --> 04:01.337
Wait, wait, wait!

04:33.037 --> 04:37.138
Venezuela is on the brink
of becoming a failed state.

04:37.174 --> 04:41.042
The economy has been
destroyed by hyperinflation.

04:41.078 --> 04:43.111
In the last 12 months alone,

04:43.146 --> 04:45.614
the inflation rate
rose over 1,000 percent.

04:45.649 --> 04:49.984
And it's projected by the IMF
to rise more than 2,000 percent

04:50.020 --> 04:51.687
in 2018.

04:51.722 --> 04:53.387
As Venezuela's currency

04:53.423 --> 04:54.989
has cratered in value,

04:55.025 --> 04:58.059
the cost of importing the
most basic goods has soared,

04:58.095 --> 04:59.828
making food and other essentials

04:59.863 --> 05:02.230
both scarce and unaffordable.

05:02.265 --> 05:05.600
Ordinary people are really suffering.

05:05.635 --> 05:07.535
Um, and they're fighting back...

05:07.570 --> 05:09.704
Veteran journalist Phil Gunson,

05:09.739 --> 05:12.072
who's been covering the
region for almost 40 years,

05:12.108 --> 05:14.408
has witnessed firsthand the events

05:14.444 --> 05:17.311
that have brought
Venezuela to the brink.

05:17.347 --> 05:19.947
What caused the current situation

05:19.982 --> 05:22.483
with chaos reigning in the streets?

05:22.518 --> 05:25.353
Now that the economy has collapsed,

05:25.388 --> 05:27.988
the issue on the streets
is not an issue of ideology.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.090
It's not people out
on the streets saying,

05:30.126 --> 05:32.259
"We want capitalism
instead of socialism."

05:32.294 --> 05:34.527
It's people out on the streets
saying, "We want to eat."

06:02.623 --> 06:04.623
This food shortage is widespread.

06:04.659 --> 06:06.458
Over the last year,

06:06.494 --> 06:07.927
three-quarters of the population

06:07.962 --> 06:10.629
has lost an average of almost 20 pounds.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.873
People are genuinely...

06:21.909 --> 06:23.609
dying of hunger, in some cases.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.345
Twelve percent of children

06:26.380 --> 06:28.847
are suffering from acute
malnutrition in Venezuela.

06:28.882 --> 06:31.850
This is the country with the
biggest oil reserves in the world.

06:31.885 --> 06:33.718
It's absolutely unforgivable.

06:35.155 --> 06:36.855
Oil is the foundation

06:36.890 --> 06:38.556
of the Venezuelan economy,

06:38.591 --> 06:41.559
accounting for half the
government's revenue.

06:41.594 --> 06:43.895
So, the nation's economy, and fortunes,

06:43.931 --> 06:46.131
rise and fall with
the price of crude oil

06:46.166 --> 06:48.066
on international markets.

06:48.101 --> 06:50.401
Venezuela is well over
90 percent dependent

06:50.437 --> 06:52.903
on oil income for its foreign earnings.

06:52.939 --> 06:57.107
The society has come to rely

06:57.143 --> 07:00.611
on this economic cycle of boom and bust

07:00.647 --> 07:02.246
that's inherent in oil.

07:02.281 --> 07:06.283
And it's created a society in which, um,

07:06.319 --> 07:09.153
there's very little
planning for the future,

07:09.188 --> 07:11.956
corruption is kind of...

07:11.991 --> 07:14.158
at least to a large extent, tolerated.

07:14.193 --> 07:16.193
By the late 1970s,

07:16.229 --> 07:20.630
oil had made Venezuela the
richest country in South America.

07:20.666 --> 07:23.066
But over the coming decades,
persistent corruption

07:23.101 --> 07:26.703
funneled the nation's wealth
into the hands of the elite.

07:28.173 --> 07:30.540
The result was profound
income inequality

07:30.576 --> 07:33.744
that set the stage for
a socialist revolution

07:33.779 --> 07:35.479
led by Hugo Chávez.

07:46.258 --> 07:49.225
Chavez was a larger-than-life figure,

07:49.261 --> 07:52.395
messianic, a figure who was loved,

07:52.430 --> 07:55.398
not just as a politician,
but revered as a saint

07:55.433 --> 07:58.033
by millions of people in Venezuela.

07:58.068 --> 08:01.003
Chavez made government a spectacle.

08:06.610 --> 08:10.078
Every Sunday, he staged
marathon TV broadcasts

08:10.114 --> 08:12.381
that sometimes ran up to eight hours,

08:12.416 --> 08:15.150
on his show, Aló Presidente.

08:15.185 --> 08:17.386
On top of announcing
government business,

08:17.421 --> 08:19.521
such as nationalizing agriculture

08:19.556 --> 08:20.923
and telecom industries,

08:20.958 --> 08:23.625
the show featured special guests,

08:23.660 --> 08:26.395
dance numbers, and prize giveaways.

08:34.337 --> 08:36.770
But while he was giving away appliances,

08:36.807 --> 08:38.539
the economy, and specifically

08:38.575 --> 08:40.607
the oil industry, was crumbling.

08:40.644 --> 08:44.912
The problem is that, the economic
underpinnings of what he was about,

08:44.948 --> 08:47.114
um, were not really viable.

08:49.355 --> 08:53.157
The legacy of Chavez's
disastrous economic strategy

08:53.192 --> 08:55.159
is the heart of today's crisis.

08:55.194 --> 08:57.428
We flew to Lake Maracaibo,

08:57.463 --> 09:00.664
epicenter of the country's
boom-and-bust economy.

09:00.699 --> 09:05.101
This is one of the largest
oil basins in the world.

09:05.137 --> 09:08.405
Over 30 billion barrels of oil

09:08.440 --> 09:10.674
have been pulled out of this lake

09:10.709 --> 09:13.577
and the estimates range
that there are still

09:13.612 --> 09:17.480
somewhere between 19 and
another 40 billion barrels of oil

09:17.516 --> 09:19.382
still left down there.

09:21.520 --> 09:24.720
Ulises Albornoz worked for
the state-run oil company,

09:24.756 --> 09:27.790
Petroleum of Venezuela, or PDVSA,

09:27.825 --> 09:31.561
and experienced the effect of
Chavez's policies firsthand.

09:37.628 --> 09:40.469
One of Chavez's first moves
to change the oil industry

09:40.504 --> 09:43.105
was replacing the
PDVSA board of directors

09:43.140 --> 09:44.874
with political allies.

09:44.909 --> 09:47.509
Much of the PDVSA workforce was outraged

09:47.545 --> 09:49.478
and took to the streets.

09:49.513 --> 09:51.813
In response, Chavez fired seven

09:51.848 --> 09:54.883
of the company's top
executives live on TV.

10:07.814 --> 10:12.200
In the end, Chavez fired
18,000 PDVSA employees

10:12.235 --> 10:15.103
and replaced them with more
politically loyal workers

10:15.138 --> 10:18.439
who knew next to nothing
about oil production.

10:18.475 --> 10:21.610
So, basically, Chavez
fired half of the...

10:21.645 --> 10:24.678
almost half of the 40,000 employees

10:24.714 --> 10:26.547
of the state oil company.

10:29.418 --> 10:31.285
18,000 people. And you were one of them?

10:41.201 --> 10:42.229
Yeah.

10:44.670 --> 10:45.565
Got it.

10:47.069 --> 10:48.736
In addition to the incompetence

10:48.771 --> 10:51.404
of the Chavez loyalists who run PDVSA,

10:51.440 --> 10:53.741
corruption has been a major factor

10:53.776 --> 10:55.676
in the decline of the oil industry.

10:55.711 --> 10:58.077
Billions have been
stolen in recent years,

10:58.113 --> 11:02.349
creating a new and very
rich socialist elite.

11:02.384 --> 11:04.717
With oil production at all-time lows,

11:04.753 --> 11:07.654
Venezuela's economy is
now much more vulnerable

11:07.689 --> 11:09.722
to the ups and downs
of the global market.

11:09.758 --> 11:12.125
Venezuela is acutely vulnerable

11:12.161 --> 11:13.960
to a fall in the price of oil,

11:13.995 --> 11:15.862
which, as we know, tends to be cyclical,

11:15.897 --> 11:17.630
and it tends to be
severe when it happens.

11:17.666 --> 11:18.798
And essentially,

11:18.833 --> 11:20.599
what Venezuela's living on now

11:20.635 --> 11:22.969
is less than half of the oil price

11:23.004 --> 11:24.837
that it had a few years back.

11:24.873 --> 11:27.974
The oil money ran out more or less
at the same time as Chavez died.

11:28.009 --> 11:31.310
So, simultaneously, they
lost a large amount of income,

11:31.345 --> 11:34.313
plus, the guy that held
the whole thing together.

11:34.348 --> 11:36.114
And it's been downhill ever since.

11:37.718 --> 11:40.786
A month after Chavez's death in 2013,

11:40.821 --> 11:43.989
a bitterly divided
nation went to the polls.

11:44.024 --> 11:46.124
Vice President Nicolás Maduro,

11:46.160 --> 11:47.959
a former bus driver,

11:47.995 --> 11:49.661
narrowly won the presidential election

11:49.697 --> 11:52.864
over opposition leader
Henrique Capriles.

11:52.900 --> 11:56.802
Since then, Maduro has stuck
with many of Chavez's policies,

11:56.837 --> 11:59.905
and for the most part
has ruled by decree.

11:59.940 --> 12:02.873
Meanwhile, the economy, hunger,

12:02.909 --> 12:05.276
narcotrafficking, and violent crime,

12:05.312 --> 12:08.112
have continued to spiral out of control,

12:08.147 --> 12:12.049
and the opposition to his
government intensified.

12:12.085 --> 12:14.118
By December of 2015,

12:14.153 --> 12:17.422
Venezuelans had voted to give
control of Venezuela's congress

12:17.457 --> 12:20.424
and national assembly,
to the opposition parties.

12:20.459 --> 12:23.694
In response, Maduro
called a special election

12:23.730 --> 12:25.696
to create a constituent assembly,

12:25.732 --> 12:28.298
a unique institution with the power

12:28.334 --> 12:30.901
to change the nation's constitution.

12:30.937 --> 12:33.938
Many believe he will use
this governmental body

12:33.973 --> 12:35.905
to consolidate his power.

12:45.251 --> 12:47.284
It is this move that has sparked

12:47.319 --> 12:50.587
the intensified protests
of the past three months.

12:59.330 --> 13:00.830
Maduro's forces have responded

13:00.866 --> 13:02.832
with mass arrests and violence

13:02.868 --> 13:04.367
that also frequently target

13:04.402 --> 13:06.970
elected officials from the opposition,

13:07.005 --> 13:11.440
including Capriles, his
presidential opponent in 2013,

13:11.476 --> 13:13.576
who, with 49 percent of the vote,

13:13.611 --> 13:15.811
lost by less than two percentage points.

13:15.846 --> 13:18.481
We're outside the Justice First office.

13:18.516 --> 13:21.617
The head of the party,
Henrique Capriles,

13:21.653 --> 13:25.154
uh, just got beat down by
the National Guard here.

13:25.189 --> 13:28.891
And there's still tear
gas and clashing going on.

13:28.926 --> 13:31.326
They're about to do a press conference.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.715
Hello, Governor. How are you?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.650
Nice to meet you. Mucho gusto.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.300
Yeah, it's shocking.

14:11.634 --> 14:13.301
After this violence,

14:13.336 --> 14:15.135
what's gonna happen tomorrow?

14:33.588 --> 14:35.388
In the two months after we filmed,

14:35.423 --> 14:38.725
and as the date of Maduro's
constituent assembly approached,

14:38.760 --> 14:41.294
the crisis has escalated.

14:41.330 --> 14:45.431
On June 27th, a police
officer hijacked a helicopter

14:45.467 --> 14:47.967
and attacked the
Maduro-controlled supreme court

14:48.002 --> 14:51.103
with grenades and gunfire.

14:51.138 --> 14:53.906
Only days later, Maduro loyalists

14:53.941 --> 14:56.743
stormed the national assembly,
attacking security guards,

14:56.778 --> 15:00.813
journalists, and the
lawmakers themselves.

15:00.849 --> 15:03.583
On July 16th, in a
show of mass defiance,

15:03.618 --> 15:07.319
more than seven million
Venezuelans voted to recall Maduro

15:07.355 --> 15:10.489
in a symbolic, nationwide referendum.

15:15.229 --> 15:17.329
On the eve of this historic vote,

15:17.365 --> 15:19.365
that looked set to transform Venezuela,

15:19.400 --> 15:22.901
VICE went back to
Caracas with Ben Anderson.

15:25.506 --> 15:28.840
This is the national
assembly, Venezuela's congress,

15:28.876 --> 15:33.044
four weeks after Maduro loyalists
attacked the politicians.

15:33.079 --> 15:34.713
Congressman Armando Armas

15:34.748 --> 15:37.448
was one of the lawmakers
badly beaten that day.

15:43.189 --> 15:45.023
That's definitely my blood.

15:45.058 --> 15:47.325
I was... my head and this is my hand.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.593
And the risk of physical
danger continues.

15:49.629 --> 15:53.064
First vice president of the
national assembly, Freddy Guevara,

15:53.099 --> 15:56.333
showed us the death threats he's
been receiving on a daily basis.

15:56.368 --> 15:59.303
"Save your money for...
to pay the funeral...

15:59.338 --> 16:01.238
of every member of your family."

16:01.273 --> 16:03.273
This is not normal
business for a politician.

16:03.309 --> 16:06.076
And there will be a big
protest this afternoon.

16:06.111 --> 16:10.713
I'm sure that the protest will increase.

16:10.749 --> 16:14.351
We are not going to step down.

16:16.922 --> 16:18.956
Today the instructions
are for all the protesters

16:18.991 --> 16:21.891
to stay in separate
groups across the city,

16:21.927 --> 16:24.428
to make it harder for the
National Guard to break them up.

16:24.463 --> 16:26.063
Protests have been outlawed

16:26.098 --> 16:28.397
with tough sentences
for those who disobeyed.

16:28.433 --> 16:31.233
We've just left the second area,
where there's a small protest.

16:31.269 --> 16:34.003
There's hundreds of
National Guard on motorbikes.

16:34.038 --> 16:36.806
The National Guard
maintained rigid control

16:36.842 --> 16:38.541
of the Caracas streets.

16:38.577 --> 16:40.710
We caught up with Freddy Guevara again,

16:40.745 --> 16:43.312
who said that the upcoming
vote was just rubber-stamping

16:43.348 --> 16:46.415
Maduro's drive towards
authoritarian rule.

16:46.451 --> 16:48.141
Do you think it's a dictatorship now,

16:48.142 --> 16:49.685
or do you think it will
become one on Sunday?

17:12.776 --> 17:14.977
Do you think you might
all be in jail on Monday?

17:30.860 --> 17:33.027
President Maduro called this election

17:33.062 --> 17:35.162
to create a constituent assembly,

17:35.197 --> 17:37.899
a 545-seat governmental body

17:37.934 --> 17:42.036
that can override and likely
replace the elected congress.

17:42.071 --> 17:45.606
It would also have the power to
rewrite the country's constitution

17:45.642 --> 17:47.975
and extend Maduro's reign.

17:48.011 --> 17:50.411
If that weren't enough,
the majority of candidates

17:50.446 --> 17:52.646
were hand-picked supporters of Maduro,

17:52.681 --> 17:54.814
including his wife and son.

17:54.850 --> 17:57.251
And there was no option
to oppose the move.

17:57.286 --> 17:58.952
With no possible way to vote against

17:58.987 --> 18:00.620
the government's proposed action,

18:00.656 --> 18:02.822
the opposition boycotted the election,

18:02.858 --> 18:05.892
hoping a low turnout
at many polling places

18:05.928 --> 18:08.261
would expose the vote as a sham.

18:08.296 --> 18:11.130
Instead, people again
gathered on the streets

18:11.166 --> 18:14.300
in the only way they could,
to make their voices heard.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.247
But just as demonstrations
began to form,

18:28.283 --> 18:29.949
the National Guard followed through

18:29.984 --> 18:33.119
on threats to crush any dissent.

18:47.034 --> 18:49.267
By midday, opposition
leaders were regrouping,

18:49.303 --> 18:51.536
trying to decide what to do next.

19:45.758 --> 19:48.091
One motorcycle unit
of the National Guard

19:48.127 --> 19:50.560
was attacked with a
homemade petrol bomb.

19:56.468 --> 19:59.536
Seven guards were injured.

20:30.001 --> 20:32.601
Intense clashes across
the country made this day

20:32.636 --> 20:35.604
the most violent since the crisis began.

20:38.008 --> 20:39.908
By the time the results were announced,

20:39.943 --> 20:43.144
16 people had been killed
and dozens more injured.

20:43.180 --> 20:44.746
But Maduro had succeeded

20:44.781 --> 20:47.048
in creating his constituent assembly.

21:00.597 --> 21:01.896
At the opposition headquarters,

21:01.932 --> 21:03.497
Governor Henrique Capriles,

21:03.533 --> 21:05.299
Maduro's presidential rival,

21:05.335 --> 21:07.401
made a statement to the local press.

21:31.326 --> 21:33.593
I'm sure you know what
the final result will be.

21:33.629 --> 21:35.595
What will be your response?

22:05.293 --> 22:07.894
Later that night, we headed
over to Bolivar Plaza,

22:07.929 --> 22:11.197
in the city center, where
Maduro supporters had gathered.

23:59.003 --> 24:01.303
It was predictable
that the United States

24:01.338 --> 24:02.938
would cast doubt on this vote.

24:02.973 --> 24:04.473
Much harder to refute

24:04.509 --> 24:06.742
was a claim from the
London-based technology firm

24:06.778 --> 24:09.378
that supplied the voting
machines used for this election.

24:09.413 --> 24:13.315
The turnout numbers on
Sunday, 30th of July,

24:13.350 --> 24:15.850
for the constituent
assembly in Venezuela,

24:15.886 --> 24:17.519
were tampered with.

24:17.554 --> 24:19.654
The difference between
the actual participation

24:19.689 --> 24:22.057
and the one announced by the authorities

24:22.092 --> 24:23.792
is at least one million votes.

24:23.827 --> 24:25.760
An independent exit poll

24:25.796 --> 24:27.862
suggested the actual
turnout was even lower,

24:27.898 --> 24:30.498
with just over 3.5
million people voting.

24:30.534 --> 24:32.700
Less than 20 percent of Venezuela's

24:32.736 --> 24:35.369
19.8 million eligible voters.

24:35.405 --> 24:38.172
The congress met in a last-ditch effort

24:38.207 --> 24:40.274
to stop what looked to be inevitable.

24:40.310 --> 24:41.910
They're calling on
the people of Venezuela

24:41.945 --> 24:43.544
to come and defend
this national assembly.

24:47.716 --> 24:49.716
The United States imposed
additional sanctions

24:49.752 --> 24:51.819
aimed directly at Maduro himself.

24:51.854 --> 24:54.621
Maduro is not just a bad leader,

24:54.657 --> 24:56.824
he is now a dictator.

24:56.859 --> 24:59.159
Maduro immediately played the part

24:59.194 --> 25:00.561
of a typical dictator,

25:00.596 --> 25:02.596
snatching two leading
opposition figures...

25:02.631 --> 25:06.099
Leopoldo López, the leader
of the Popular Will party,

25:06.134 --> 25:09.269
and Antonia Ledezma, the
former mayor of Caracas...

25:09.304 --> 25:11.104
from their homes the following night.

25:15.977 --> 25:16.943
The socialist revolutionaries

25:16.979 --> 25:20.013
who once overthrew an
unpopular and corrupt elite,

25:20.048 --> 25:21.547
have become one.

25:21.583 --> 25:24.150
Even parts of the
military began to defect.

25:33.427 --> 25:35.862
One of Latin America's
most important nations,

25:35.897 --> 25:38.397
in control of the world's
largest oil reserves,

25:38.432 --> 25:39.999
has become a dictatorship.

25:53.480 --> 25:56.581
But while Maduro's die-hard
supporters celebrate,

25:56.617 --> 25:59.784
athe growing opposition has
vowed to continue to fight.
