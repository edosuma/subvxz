00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
[shovel thudding]

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
[man panting]

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
[thudding continues]

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
[water splashing]

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
[Herschel]  In old country of Schlupsk, I am ditch digger.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
It is not always great.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Life is difficult.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
But then one day,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Hashem gives me a miracle.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
[indistinct chatter]

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
[Herschel]  Her name is Sarah.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
She is strong

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
and she has all her teeth, top and bottom.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I decide at once to woo her.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
[speaking foreign language]

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
[speaking Yiddish]

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
[Herschel]  Wooing fails,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
but I am determined to win her.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Every day, I dig twice the ditch.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
It is greatest summer of my life.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
We have so much in common.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Her favorite color black. My favorite color black.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Her parents murdered by Cossacks.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
My parents murdered by Cossacks.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I notice nice little thing about her.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
She always sneeze same way.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Four time.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Is adorable.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Sometimes, when we want to be alone,

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
we go to very special bog.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
We tell each other all our hopes and dreams.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
[Sarah speaking foreign language]

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
[chuckles]

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Oh.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
[both chuckling]

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
[sighs]

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
[Herschel]  We have wedding in front of whole town.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Hashem blesses us.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
[shouts in foreign language]

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
[Herschel]  For a bit.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
We are attacked by Cossacks.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Bloodthirsty, Jew-hungry,

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Russian maniacs drunk from vodka.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Jew!

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
-[sword swishing] -[indistinct shouting]

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
[Herschel]  The Cossacks destroy our whole world.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
But...

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
we are the Greenbaums.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
We are strong.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
And together there is no stopping us.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
We keep fighting till we have American dream.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
[man] All right, let's get these

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
dumb Polacks outta here.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
[child screams]

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
[Herschel] Compared to Cossacks,

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
Americans very kind.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
[man] All right. This way, you filthy Jews. Let's go.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
[Herschel]  I find good job in pickle factory.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
A good Jewish business.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
The foreman will not let me mix salt.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Or sort cucumber.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
But he says I can chase rats with club

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
and he will pay nickel for every ten Herschel smash.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
[rat squeaking]

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
[grunts]

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
[Herschel] It is not dream job.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
But I am grateful for chance to prove my worth.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Get your seltzer water here! Just one bright, shiny nickel.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
[Herschel]  Some things still out of reach.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Seltzer water. Get your seltzer water!

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Yeah, you, sir. Seltzer water today?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It's only one bright, shiny nickel for the men.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
It's only one bright, shiny nickel for the ladies.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
[Herschel]  But over time we work and save.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I grant Sarah's wish.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
A beautiful Greenbaum family plot

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
for us to share.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Forever.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Then Hashem gives us biggest miracle of all.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
So one night to Sarah

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I make this vow.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Our child will be strong.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
And our child's child will be strong.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
Our family will prosper.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
And in 100 years,

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
the Greenbaums will be powerful.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Successful.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
The strongest in the land.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
[Herschel] And then one day,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
everything changed.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
[rats squeaking]

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
[squeaking]

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
[screaming]

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Attention!

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
This factory has been condemned.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
[indistinct chatter]

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
[thuds]

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
-Damn it. -Shit.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
[boy 1] Dude, we're never gonna find this, bro.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
[boy 2] No, it's definitely this way.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Whoa.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
[lid clattering]

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
[all screaming]

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
[boy] Let's go!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
[breathing heavily]

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
-[indistinct chatter] -[cameras flashing]

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Please! Please! Settle down.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Essentially, the pickle brine preserved him perfectly.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
It's been 100 years, but he hasn't aged a day.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
-That's impossible. -You don't honestly expect us

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
to buy that, do you?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
What's the science behind it?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Please, let me explain.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
[Herschel] The scientist explains.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
His logic is good.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
It satisfies everyone.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
-Oh, yes. -It makes sense.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
-Absolutely. -Very clear.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
[Herschel]  But...

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm very sad.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
The world has changed.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Everything I know is gone. And...

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
...everyone.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
[doctor] I'm so sorry, Herschel.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
You will check again.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
We already checked the city records twice.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
She wasn't brined.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
She's been dead for 80 years.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
You will check again.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
We already checked.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
[grunts]

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
[alarm beeping]

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
[Herschel] My Sarah is gone.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Our child is gone.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I have nothing.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Then I get some great news.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Great news, Herschel.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
It took a little bit of doing,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
but we were able to track down a living relative.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
I have family?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Yes.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
A great-grandson.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
And, as luck would have it, he lives right here in Brooklyn

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
and he's exactly the same age as you.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
-His name is "Ben Greenbaum." -[sighs]

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
And we're contacting him right now.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Thank you.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
[Herschel]  I am so excited I forget all my misery.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Even though I have not met this Ben,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
I can see him in my mind.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
He will be just like how I vowed to Sarah,

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
powerful.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Successful.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
The strongest in the land.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
[man speaking indistinctly]

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
[man sneezes four times]

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
-[woman] Bless you. -[man] Oh, I'm sorry.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Excuse me.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Greenbaum.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Greenbaum.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Greenbaum.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Greenbaum.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Greenbaum!

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Greenbaum!

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Greenbaum!

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
[laughs]

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
All right!

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
This is nuts. [laughs]

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
It must be so crazy for you.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Very crazy.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Crazy for me, too, man.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Are you allowed to leave?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Do you wanna come back to my apartment?

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
-Very much. -All right. Let's go.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
[Ben] Yeah, I got him. I'm his great-grandson.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
So he's gonna stay with me for a bit. Yeah. Thank you.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
[car honking]

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
[Ben] Take it in.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Cool, huh?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Make way.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
[Ben] It's a scooter.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
They're actually pretty fun.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
Anyway, I can't wait to show you, like, the future.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
There's so much cool shit, man. You're gonna love it.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
[horn honking]

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
It's cool, man. It's a cab.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
It's gonna take us back to my apartment. Hop in.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
[chuckles] It's all right.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Oh, yeah, crawl in.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
There you go. You got it.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
We're going to Brooklyn, please. Thank you.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Here we are, man.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Home, sweet home.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Hey, check this out.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Alexa, lights.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Pretty cool, huh?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
All this yours?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Yeah. I mean, I don't own it or anything like that.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
I do live here by myself. I work from home,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
though, a lot.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
It would be nice, honestly, to have someone around.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
So you can stay here as long as you want.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I do not want to be burden to you.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
It's not a burden, Herschel. At all. I mean...

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I'm amazed you're alive. [chuckles]

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I really never thought I would get a chance

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
to meet another Greenbaum. So...

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Neither did I.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
You must be thirsty.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
I mean, you were brined for, like, a century.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
And there's salt in brine, right?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
So you must be pretty parched, to say the least.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Can I get you something to drink?

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Macadamia milk? Or there's cashew milk.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
I got pea milk. They're milking peas now.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
They're milking everything these days, dude.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
You name it, they're milking it.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
I got mint tea. I have kombucha.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
-"Kombucha"? -Yeah.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.000
It's fermented... stuff. Honestly, I don't even know.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Tastes nasty. But it's very healthy.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
-Would you like some? -Is fine.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
They inject drink into my arm in hospital.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
-I am fine. -Fair enough.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
There must be something I can get you.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Would you like some seltzer?

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
You have seltzer.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Oh, I got seltzer for days, son.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
I got a whole seltzer machine. It's pretty cool, actually.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Ya just fill this up there.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
That's it. You put in the cartridge.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
"Cartridge."

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
And you just press that button. Makes you seltzer.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Press button.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Exactly. You wanna press it?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
You'll let me press seltzer button?

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah. It's a pretty big deal, but we're family.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
So you can press the seltzer button.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Knock yourself out.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Yeah!

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
There you go. You're seltzering.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Pretty cool, huh?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
-The bubble. -So many bubbles.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Well...

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
One for you. And one for me.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Cheers.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
L'chaim.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
Ooh!

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
[chuckles]

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
And it tells you whether or not the company is ethical

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
by analyzing its carbon footprint,

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
its labor policies,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
You know, you might think it's kinda silly.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
But I've been working on it pretty hard

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
for five years now, basically.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And once I sell this thing, I can finally, you know,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
start the next chapter, which is exciting.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
You work for five years. How come you no sell?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
It's just...

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
not ready yet.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
I think once it's ready, though, I'll have

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
a pretty easy time selling it.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I went to school with this guy who works in venture capital.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000

He said that they wanna hear the pitch as soon as it's done.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000

No, that's David Bowie.

Is this your mother?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
No, that's also David Bowie.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
That whole poster's David Bowie.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
How come in this whole place you have so many things,

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
but no pictures of family?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
I have pictures of my family.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000

I also had a Jumanji-themed bar mitzvah.

[woman] Hey, man, how's it going?

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Yeah, not fantastic.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
I found out I gotta basically throw away

42:17.000 --> 42:21.000
the app I was working on,

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
and start again from scratch.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
-Bummer. -Yeah. Big bummer.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
But I'll think of something.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
[Herschel] It's about the smell.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
You know is good.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Pickles should smell like vomit.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Excuse me, what is that?

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
It's a blog post about that old-timey pickle guy

42:32.000 --> 42:36.000
over on  Bedford.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Oh, yeah. I heard about that guy.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
It's crazy, right? Look, here, check it out.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Herschel's jars have no label,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
and his product doesn't even have a name.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
But he just might be the most authentic

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
artisanal pickler in all of Williamsburg.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
And his accent is cute AF.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
Hello.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Aww! Oh, my God!

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
So he uses, like, repurposed pickle jars,

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
cucumbers, salt and rainwater, and that's it.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
Time to invest right now, right?

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
Is this a popular blog?

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
This video's got like a million views,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
so people are loving this pickle guy.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
Maybe we should sell those here.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Picklebacks, pickle shots. That's cool, right?

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
[man] Looks cool.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
-[woman] Aw, I love his hat. -[man] I know.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Herschel, your pickles are the hottest thing in Brooklyn.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
How does it feel to be such a runaway success?

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
Ben Greenbaum, you see me now on your television box.

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
Well, I become huge success.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
Soon I buy back Cossack billboard

43:51.000 --> 43:54.000
and I prove you are stupid.

43:54.000 --> 43:57.000
You are stupidest person I ever seen in my life.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
Wow, that Ben guy really sounds stupid.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
...genius compared to you.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
[clears throat]  Okay. Not sure who Ben is.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Herschel, I understand your pickles are made

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
with rainwater.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
-Rainwater, yes. -Yes.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.000
Rainwater from gutters.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
Nutrients from roof come off into jar.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
[reporter]  There's bird droppings in there?

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
[Herschel]  All sorts of animal parts in here.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Little essence of animal feet.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
Could you pull over, please?

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Hello. Health Department?

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
I'd like to file a complaint.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
-There you go. You take pickle.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
-Gratitude.

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Are you Herschel Greenbaum?

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Yes, 14 dollar for pickle.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
Ten dollar extra if you want telephone photograph

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
with the Herschel.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Get in line.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
Listen, you're gonna have to shut this down immediately.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Why shut down?

44:54.000 --> 44:57.000
Because you've got dozens of flagrant health violations.

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
You can't just take food out of a garbage can

44:57.000 --> 45:01.000
and sell it to people.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
-That's insane. -But is all-natural. Is vegan.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
No benzoate. No preservative.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
You're lucky no one has died.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
You owe $12,000 in taxes, fees and fines.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
Till then, you are shut down.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
[cellphone buzzing]

45:28.000 --> 45:29.000
[woman] Ew. Guys.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Eighty-six the pickles. They're made out of garbage.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
-[scoffs] -[indistinct chatter]

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
Nope.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
[woman] Oh, my God.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
-CHRISTIAN: Herschel, we heard the terrible news.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
-KEVIN: Yeah, what happened?

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
I was shut down by evil woman.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
They tell me I have to "bring things up to code."

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
I do not know how to do this all by myself.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
-You could scale up the business, right?

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
-True.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
-Maybe hire some workers. -That's good.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Cannot afford workers.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
You could get interns!

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
[Christian gasps] Yes.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
"Interns"?

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Yeah, they're unpaid workers.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
Unpaid workers.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
Right. You compensate them in education and experience.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Like slave?

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
No, no, no. That's not what I mean.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
That's a little bit of an oversimplification.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
Now, listen, Herschel. You run a small,

46:38.000 --> 46:42.000
ethically conscious...

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Next.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
Mr. Greenbaum, I would just like to thank you in advance

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
for considering me for this internship.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
My name is Clara. I am a rising senior at NYU.

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
I have a 4.2 GPA. I am president

46:55.000 --> 46:58.000
of the Asian Cinema Club--

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Show me your teeth.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Yes.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
Herschel is back!

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
Gloves, here you go. Everyone needs gloves.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
That's the regulation.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
Like the beard tucked in. That's important!

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
All right. Let's get this up to code, people.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Just pickling. No talking.

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
No!

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
No, no, no!

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
Good pickle. Bad pickle. [grunts]

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
CLARA: Almost there. Keep it up!

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
[Herschel] All right!

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
This is what we're reaching for, everybody.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.000
This is the dream.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
This is the goal.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Perfect jar of pickle.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.000
Go.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
-[man] Hey! -[woman] Hey there!

48:11.000 --> 48:12.000
[indistinct chatter]

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
[dramatic music playing]

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
[upbeat music playing]

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Yes!

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
Yes, yes, yeah!

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
[crunching]

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Thank you.

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
Yeah!

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Move it, move it!

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Hurry! Hurry up!

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
It says your deed on the lot is paid in full.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Cut it down.

49:21.000 --> 49:25.000
Herschel win! Yeah!

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
[scoffs]

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
[sighs]

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
[clicks]

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
This is the beginning. Right? You heard it here first, folks.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
Benjamin Greenbaum is gonna change the world.

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
That's what you're gonna do.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Yeah, thank you. I appreciate it.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.000
We know it. We know it.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
Oh, yeah. Bill Gates, move over.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
-Move over, Bill Gates. -Watch out, Bill.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Ben Greenbaum's got your number.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
[Ben]  I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
[Susan]  And we know you're gonna do such great things.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
-[David]  Great things. -And speaking of...

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Guys.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
-It's just a little... -A little something.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.000
Oh, my God.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
[David]  It's an investment. An investment

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
in your new company.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
-We wanted to get in on the ground floor.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
-Yes, absolutely. Bottom.

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
My company doesn't even have a name yet, so I think

51:10.000 --> 51:14.000
it's a little premature.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
Come on! You'll think of something.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
[David]  You could just call it "Mom and Dad."

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
[Susan] You're so creative, inventive.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
"Mom and Dad." I like that--

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
[banging]

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
I have done it.

51:36.000 --> 51:41.000
I have restored honor to family and conquered the Cossacks.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Congrats.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
Now I have some free time on my hands,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
so I have good news.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Herschel is back.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
I have decided I would come back

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
to be with you.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
Not for me. I am fine. Very stable.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
Not ups and downs. Herschel feel very happy

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
all the time.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
Oh, yeah?

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
But for Ben, I figure maybe I come back and I help you.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
You have no wife, no children, no friends, and now no job.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
You need help!

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Herschel will help. Do not worry.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
Go away, Herschel. I don't want you here.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Okay?

52:20.000 --> 52:23.000
Just please leave my apartment.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.000
But I am only family you have left.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
You need Herschel.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Without Herschel, you'll be all alone.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
No one to fix broken life.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
My life isn't broken, Herschel.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I'm fine. I'm completely happy.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
The only problem I have right now, honestly, is you.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Just please go!

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
If you do not realize you need Herschel,

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
you are stupider than Polish person.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
And they are the stupidest.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
How's your Twitter presence these days, Herschel?

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
What is Twitter?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
"What is Twitter?" You don't know what Twitter is?

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
Big, powerful pickle magnate like you doesn't know

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
what Twitter is?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I might know what it is by other word.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
Well, maybe tell me what it is. Clarify.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Twitter, you know, it's a marketplace of ideas

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
where the world's best and brightest come

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
to share their opinions

53:24.000 --> 53:27.000
in a very measured and reasonable manner. Twitter.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
I will do Twitter.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
You probably think you can but it's very complicated.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
I don't think you'll get it.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
-I can do anything. -I don't think you can.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
-Can you do Twitter? -Oh, I can do Twitter.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
If you can do Twitter, I can do Twitter.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
In order to do Twitter really well,

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
you gotta be raw and uncensored

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
and share your completely unfettered opinions.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
I don't think you'll be good at that.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
-I will do Twitter! -Really? I don't know.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
You watch me, Ben! I will do Twitter.

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
I will do Twitter better than anyone has ever

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
done Twitter.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Well, I'll believe it when I see it, Herschel.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
You will see it. And you will believe it.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Well, have at it, my friend!

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
Watch.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
[door closes]

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
[Clara]  Sir, some people hire a publicity team to help.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
No help.

54:09.000 --> 54:12.000
I will be Twitter and nothing can stop me now.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
Now read me back my dictation.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
Okay.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
"Wheelchair people,

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
-my pickles are so good... -Yes.

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
...it will make you forget Hashem has cursed you."

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
Hashem has cursed their legs but not their mouths.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
They can eat pickle.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.000
-Is good. -Okay.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
-Send to Twitter. -Sending.

54:30.000 --> 54:33.000
"We sell to all peoples

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
even woman, unless they are menses,

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
in which case, stay in tent."

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
Stay in tent.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
Next Twitter.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
-"Attention, sodomites." -Yes.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
"Hashem will smite you for your sin!

You will burn in flames for your crimes against God.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
Buy my pickles."

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Perfect to send.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Very good.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
Yep.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
[indistinct chatter]

55:13.000 --> 55:17.000
Oh, lots of customers today.

55:17.000 --> 55:21.000
Those are not customers. Those are protesters.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
-[woman 1] You're disgusting, man!

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
-[woman 2] How dare you?

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
"Protesters"?

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
[man] Down with Herschel!

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
[all] Down with Herschel!

55:27.000 --> 55:28.000
Down with Herschel!

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
Down with Herschel!

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
Sir, as grateful as I am to you

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
for this educational opportunity,

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
I am afraid that I can no longer

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
continue this endeavor in good conscience.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Thank you for the college credit.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
Clara!

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
[indistinct shouting]

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
Down with Herschel! Down with Herschel!

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
You traitor!

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
After everything I do for you!

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
[mouthing] I'm sorry.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.000
Down with Herschel!

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
Go away! Go away!

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
[narrator] Who is Herschel Greenbaum?

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And what is he selling?

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Is it pickles?

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
Or is it hate?

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Greenbaum's tweets are so outrageous,

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
they seem almost designed to cause offense.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.000
You're insane!

56:15.000 --> 56:19.000
[narrator]  He's drawing protests and boycotts.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
But maybe that's the point.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
Some view him as a hateful bigot

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
with rage in his heart.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
Others see him as a defender of free speech,

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
a clever provocateur testing the limits

56:29.000 --> 56:33.000
of the First Amendment.

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
[woman]  Look, I get it. He's saying

56:33.000 --> 56:37.000
some controversial things

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
but he's religious, so I believe him.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
He's what we need right now.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
[man]  Everybody in the mainstream media's like,

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
"Herschel's this terrible person."

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
I think they got it all wrong.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
He's playing chess. Everybody else

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
is playing checkers.

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
[narrator]  Tonight, we'll find out who

56:49.000 --> 56:54.000
Herschel Greenbaum really is

56:54.000 --> 56:58.000
from the man himself, Herschel Greenbaum.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Tell me, Herschel. How do you respond

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
to those who have called your belief system abhorrent?

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
I would tell these people

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
I do not understand what this word means.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
So, what you're saying is when it comes to online speech

57:12.000 --> 57:15.000
you don't understand restrictions.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
I am saying I do not understand

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
what is happening.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.000
I do not understand...

57:22.000 --> 57:23.000
what is happening...

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
with this whole thing.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
What is happening

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
with this whole thing?

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
With our culture, our country, our way of life?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
This is a question Herschel Greenbaum

57:37.000 --> 57:40.000
for better or worse, is determined to ask.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
What is happening?

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
What is happening right now?

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
I really wish somebody would tell me

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
what is happening.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Indeed.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
Herschel, you have captivated the imagination,

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
the hearts and minds of the entire world

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
with your passion and your truth.

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
Buy my pickle. Buy my pickle. Buy my pickle.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
[host]  We will.

58:27.000 --> 58:28.000
[cheering and applause]

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Okay, be that as it may

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
your stance on gender roles is so regressive

58:38.000 --> 58:41.000
that it would effectively limit women to a life of servitude.

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Exactly, servitude. Woman like to serve.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
She has little hands for serving things to people

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
in very nice, graceful way.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
Women have nipples to serve milk to people.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
Woman have hole in lower body to produce babies.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
In other words, serve babies out of hole in body.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Yeah. Yeah!

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
Woman like serve! Yes!

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
Incredibly offensive.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
-Someone is menses. -No.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
[crowd laughing]

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
That debate is certainly settled.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Let's throw it to the audience for questions.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
You, sir.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Herschel, wow. It's amazing to talk to you.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
What an honor.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.000
Honor to be here.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
I was wondering how you felt about the taxes

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
that are crushing small businesses.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
I'm glad you ask.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
You tax Herschel, Herschel will do

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
violence to you.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Yes, terrible violence!

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
[all cheering]

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Miss.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.000
Herschel, have you considered running for office?

59:39.000 --> 59:40.000
I would like office.

59:41.000 --> 59:42.000
[all cheering]

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I would like big office.

59:53.000 --> 59:57.000
I would like biggest office in America!

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Huge office!

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Oh, how about you? In the back.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Yes, the shapely young woman in the back row. Cannot see.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
[man] Yes, thank you. Hello. Thank you.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I was wondering what your thoughts are

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
on Christian prayer in public schools.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Yes, thank you.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Oh, simple question. Easy to answer.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I don't think I'm saying anything controversial

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
when I say everybody know Jesus Christ mother

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
was prostitute.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
-[all gasp] -And she invent story

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
of Christianity

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
to cover up fact that she prostitute.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
So if you believe in Jesus,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
you are stupid idiot.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
You suck, Herschel! I'm gonna get you!

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
[siren wailing]

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
[door opening]

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
[female reporter] We interrupt your

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
regularly scheduled program

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
to bring you this special report.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Herschel Greenbaum the time-traveling immigrant

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
who captured America's hearts and minds

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
has fallen hard from grace.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
The public outcry against his bigotry

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
is spreading throughout the country.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
He's been condemned by leaders on the left and right.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And that's not all.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Authorities are apparently calling for his deportation.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Due to an outdated filing system

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
at the Ellis Island storage facility,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
his paperwork cannot be located.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Therefore, his citizenship has been revoked.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
If you have information about the whereabouts

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
of the fugitive illegal alien Herschel Greenbaum,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
please call the tip hotline below.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
[host on TV]  I just feel bad for this guy at this point.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Look, I don't see how Herschel

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
can come back from this one, folks.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Everyone has deserted him. He's alone in the world.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
His life is in ruins.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
And the only person he has to blame for all of it,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
I'm sorry,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
is Herschel Greenbaum.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
[glass breaking]

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
The hell?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Dude.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Dude!

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Stop!

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Herschel, what the hell, man? What are you doing?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
These Christians, they try to kill me.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
They're not trying to kill you, Herschel.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
They just wanna send you back to Schlupsk.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Is worse! I never go back to Schlupsk.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Everything me and Sarah sacrificed

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
to come here is for nothing.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Well, I don't know what to tell you, man.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I can't do anything for you.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
There is something.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
You must smuggle Herschel away from American authorities.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
What?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I have accepted I have new fate.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I will move to Canada,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
become icicle man.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
I will trade beaver for fire.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
It's not ideal. But this is what must happen.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I'm terribly sorry this is happening to you

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
and that everyone's turned on you

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
because you've said truly despicable things.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
But I'm not gonna risk getting arrested again

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
to help you.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Is not help.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Is trade.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
"Trade"?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I know you do not like Herschel.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I know you think your life better

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.000
before Herschel.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
You take me to Canada,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
you never have to see me again.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
All right.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Ten miles to Canada, no roads, no checkpoints.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Just walk from here.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
This will work.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
[mysterious music playing]

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
[both grunting]

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
-[Ben grunts] -[thuds]

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
[groans]

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Very good.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
[shivering]

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
We stay warm together.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Thank you.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
[Ben] There's the border.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
We made it.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
[vehicle approaching]

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Oh, shit. Someone's coming. Here.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Come on. Here, come on, come on.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
This way, this way.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
[officer] Stop. Stop!

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
[grunts]

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
[indistinct chatter]

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Looks like they're just taking a break or something.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
So we'll just chill here till they're gone.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
You do not mind?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
No, I don't mind.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
-Is there a lot of woods in Schlupsk?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
-Forest.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
-What's the difference? -Wolves.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Oh, wow.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Sarah loved to chase wolf.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
She would club them with stick,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
hit them with rock, kill them.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Very good time.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
She sounds pretty amazing.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I wish I could have met her.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Although, maybe it's for the best that I didn't.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Why you say this?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I'm probably not, like,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
the best-case scenario for what the family's become.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
She probably wouldn't be too psyched to,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
you know, to see who I am.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Not so sure.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Perhaps once I live in Canada,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
you come to visit Herschel.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
You know, maybe--

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
-Maybe you don't have to go to Canada.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
-What do you mean?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I mean, now that I think about it,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
you know, maybe we just haven't exhausted all of our options.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
You don't have to go hide in Canada for the rest

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
of your life.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
We'll fix this, and in the meantime,

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
you can stay with me. We'll figure it out.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
You do not want this.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
What do you mean?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
You try to get rid of Herschel.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Take Herschel to middle of wilderness

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
to take Herschel to Canada.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
You hate Herschel.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I'm just gonna tell you this, man.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I'm the one who called the Health Department on you.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
I got you shut down. That was me.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And that's not all I did.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
I told you to go on Twitter,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
knowing you would say despicable things.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
You always do.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And I did that to sabotage your business.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Is this it?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
No. After the Twitter thing didn't destroy you,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I attended the debate you were having.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
I went to the back row and I disguised my voice

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
and I asked the question about Christian prayer in school.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
I knew exactly what you were gonna say.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I'm so sorry, Herschel.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
It was wrong. I shouldn't have done it.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I caused this whole thing to happen. Do you forgive me?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
[grunts]

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
-Wait. -You are traitor

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
to your family!

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
You are not Jew!

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Hey! Hey, you! Stop right there!

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
232, requesting backup.

[thrilling music playing]

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
[officer] Where'd he go?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I think it's that pickle guy from the news.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Come on.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Herschel Greenbaum!

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
We know you're out there.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
[panting]

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
[whirring]

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Where is this guy?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Hello there, dudes.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Who are you?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I am Ben Greenbaum.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Where's Herschel Greenbaum?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Herschel is back there.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
You better get him before he escapes.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I'm on it.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
-All right. You're free to go. -Found him!

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Thanks.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
All right, get up.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
All right, we got him.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
We got a positive ID on Herschel Greenbaum.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
-You have the right to remain silent.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
-[Ben] What?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Anything you say can and will be used against you

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
in a court of law.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
[reporter] And now, breaking news.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
This is Susan O'Malley standing inside the Manhattan Federal

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Courthouse

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
for what has been labeled one of the most bizarre trials

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
of the century.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Herschel Greenbaum has been deemed

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
a persona non grata on American soil.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
His deportation trial got off to a strange start

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
as his lawyer put forth a truly unexpected defense,

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
that Herschel Greenbaum was not,

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
in fact, actually Herschel Greenbaum.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
This is Ben Greenbaum.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
This is Herschel

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
who switched places with him because as you can see

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Herschel Greenbaum has a beard

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
whereas my client, Ben, has no beard.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I object, Your Honor.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
What precedent are we setting here?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000
That the defendant isn't actually the defendant?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Well, then, maybe Charles Manson

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
wasn't actually Charles Manson.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Let me try something really fast.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000
So I'm me, I'm me, the guy you know.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Is this a new guy?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
With that, I move to dismiss the defense's entire case.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Granted.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Court adjourned.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
[reporter]  Herschel was quickly put on a ship

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
back to Eastern Europe

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
returning to his home country of Schlupsk.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000
And with that, America can finally rest easy.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
The abomination known as Herschel Greenbaum

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.000
will never wreak havoc on our great land ever again.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Back to you, Jim.

Oh, Sarah.

Excuse me, do you speak English?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
No?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Excuse me. Hi.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Do you guys speak English? No? No?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Thank you. Thank you.

Excuse me?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Excuse me, hi.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I need help. I'm very cold.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Do you know where maybe they'll help me?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Do you know where I could go for some help?

Thank you.

Yeah.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000

Prayer for dead.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I don't know the words to the prayers. I'm sorry--

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Is fine!

Amen.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Yeah, I've...

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I've lost some people.

Hello.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Is Herschel.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Yeah, I figured that out.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Alexa tell me how to fly here.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000
I am truly sorry for doing violence to you.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
And getting you deported to Schlupsk.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I was wrong.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
It's okay.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Is not okay.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I was wrong about you.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I thought you did not care about family.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
But now I see with your Boop Bops,

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
you were just trying to honor family.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
This is why you do not sell Boop Bops

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and you sit alone all day.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Not because you are coward.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
You not sell Boop Bops

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
because you are afraid to let down family.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
But you do not.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I never met mother or father,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
but they would be proud.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Sarah would be proud.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I am very proud.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
You make my vow come true.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
You are everything I hoped family would become.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Thank you.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Thank you.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
All right. Come.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
I would like to show you some place.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
[Ben] This place is really nice.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I really get it.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
[Herschel] It's very special place.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
This was Sarah's favorite place.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
She had good taste.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
She would be very happy to know you see this place.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
I'm glad I got to see it.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
You know, I had an idea the other day.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
What? What is idea?

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Promise not to laugh?

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
I promise.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Okay, so people love your pickles.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
-They do. It's true. -Can't get enough of 'em.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
It's the brine. It make people go crazy.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.000
And, you know, I'm good with the internet,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
good at building websites, things like that.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
So I thought maybe I can build a website,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
we sell your pickles to people all around the world.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Family business.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Yeah. Family business.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
You can pickle more things than cucumbers these days.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
You can pickle watermelon. You can pickle strawberries.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
They pickle fruit these days?

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Oh, yeah. You thought they were milking a lot?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Wait till you hear what they're pickling.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Just when I think I figure it out,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.000
you throw a pickled watermelon at me. I'm like, "Oof!"

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
It's a crazy world out there, man.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Many people still hate Herschel very much.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
That is true.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I say many terrible things. And if one thing true

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
in America,

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000
once you say terrible things, you will never be success.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
That is not true. At all.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
Oh, that's great news.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Still, we should make some apologies.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
All I know is that whatever we do next,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
we should do it together.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Together?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Yeah.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Together.

[uplifting music playing]

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Do you wanna pray?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
You do not mind?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000

Amen.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
[Herschel] I like her very much.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
-Barbra Streisand? -Yes.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
[Herschel] Very attractive trait,

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
dress like boy to go to yeshiva.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
I've always said that.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
She little Jew boy. She dress like little Jew boy.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
But little Jew woman underneath there.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
You're really coloring it in a new way.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
It's very naughty.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000
It is super naughty the way you describe it. Yeah.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
