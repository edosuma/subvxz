02:19.280 --> 02:20.440
Mom, what are you doing?

02:20.515 --> 02:22.210
You're going to catch
your death.

02:22.283 --> 02:23.682
Come on inside.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.175
Mr. Sullivan?

02:56.051 --> 02:56.983
Mr. Sullivan!

02:57.052 --> 03:01.079
God just took out
Mrs. Gruper's birdbath.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.992
He's getting closer, Clive.

03:08.063 --> 03:11.328
Last year, it was streetlight
at the end of the block.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.367
Now it's Mrs. Gruper's birdbath.

03:13.435 --> 03:15.960
I think God's
zeroing in on me.

03:16.037 --> 03:19.598
I have the feeling this is
the year he lowers the boom.

03:19.674 --> 03:21.073
Still alive in there, old lady?

03:21.176 --> 03:22.871
Didn't die in your sleep,
did you?

03:22.944 --> 03:24.411
Not yet.

03:26.948 --> 03:28.609
Well, you're talking
to yourself,

03:28.683 --> 03:30.173
so it can't be too long.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.084
As a matter of fact,
I wasn't talking to myself.

03:33.221 --> 03:34.688
I was talking to Clive Sr.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.015
Good. For a while there,

03:36.091 --> 03:37.922
I thought you were going batty
on me.

03:37.992 --> 03:39.550
Can I interest you
in a cup of tea?

03:39.627 --> 03:40.616
No.

03:40.695 --> 03:42.026
Not now, not ever.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.621
Why are you wearing
a necktie?

03:43.698 --> 03:44.995
You're not in trouble

03:45.066 --> 03:46.533
with the police again, are you?

03:46.634 --> 03:48.192
Not unless you blew the whistle
on all my parking tickets.

03:48.303 --> 03:49.235
I should.

03:49.304 --> 03:50.669
There's probably a reward.

03:51.739 --> 03:54.902
Before they do throw
you in the hoosegow,

03:55.009 --> 03:57.102
would you mind fixing
the porch railing?

03:57.212 --> 03:58.975
It's been broken for a month.

03:59.047 --> 04:00.036
Sure thing, old girl.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.082
Just don't forget.

04:01.216 --> 04:02.410
Do I ever?

04:02.484 --> 04:04.018
Yes.

04:04.018 --> 04:06.316
Well, I won't this time.

04:06.387 --> 04:08.355
So, what's The Bank
been up to lately?

04:08.423 --> 04:10.687
I wish
you wouldn't call him that.

04:10.925 --> 04:13.325
Is Clive Jr. Springing
for Thanksgiving dinner?

04:13.428 --> 04:15.020
Yes. As a matter of fact,

04:15.096 --> 04:17.495
my son is taking me
to the country club.

04:17.565 --> 04:18.623
Uh-huh.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.634
We wear the chains
we forge in life.

04:20.702 --> 04:21.668
I don't suppose

04:21.736 --> 04:24.204
you remember who said that.

04:24.272 --> 04:25.204
You did, Miss Beryl.

04:25.273 --> 04:26.934
All through eighth grade.

04:30.178 --> 04:31.110
Hey, dummy.

04:31.179 --> 04:32.908
Don't you have enough sense
to come inside

04:32.981 --> 04:34.039
where it's warm?

04:34.115 --> 04:35.605
You know what I always wish?

04:35.683 --> 04:38.948
I wish I had me enough money
for a warm coat.

04:39.020 --> 04:40.681
You know what else I wish?

04:40.755 --> 04:42.620
No, what else do you wish?

04:42.690 --> 04:45.989
I wish we'd go back to working
together like we used to.

04:46.060 --> 04:49.029
I hear Carl Roebuck
has this big Victorian...

04:49.097 --> 04:50.223
Oh, no.

04:50.298 --> 04:51.299
Well, he's redoing it.

04:51.299 --> 04:52.300
Nah, forget it.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.961
Six months work, all indoors.

04:54.035 --> 04:56.128
Told you I'm not working
for him again.

04:56.271 --> 04:58.501
Besides, my lawyer says when I
get out of court today,

04:58.573 --> 04:59.665
I'm going to be a rich man.

05:01.576 --> 05:02.474
Uh...

05:05.146 --> 05:07.239
in that case, can I borrow
ten dollars?

05:07.315 --> 05:08.475
Rub...

05:08.550 --> 05:11.644
there are women in this town
that I could hang out with

05:11.719 --> 05:13.550
that would be cheaper than you.

05:13.621 --> 05:15.350
Yeah, but they wouldn't be
your friend.

05:25.433 --> 05:26.900
Well, here we are again,
Mr. Wirfley.

05:26.968 --> 05:28.026
The question is, why?

05:28.102 --> 05:32.061
Your Honor, we would like
to document for the court

05:32.173 --> 05:36.542
the deterioration
of my client's knee,

05:36.611 --> 05:39.045
resulting from an injury
he sustained

05:39.113 --> 05:42.310
while in the employ of the
Tip Top Construction Company.

05:42.383 --> 05:47.514
I have here countless documents
from reputable doctors

05:47.589 --> 05:49.352
who have...

05:49.424 --> 05:51.619
who have...

05:51.693 --> 05:52.717
I had them here someplace, uh...

05:52.961 --> 05:54.258
- Mr. Wirfley...
- With your patience...

05:54.329 --> 05:55.387
Uh, Mr. Wirfley...

05:55.463 --> 05:56.487
Your Honor?

05:56.564 --> 05:58.555
You have failed on numerous
occasions to demonstrate

05:58.633 --> 06:00.863
that the injury in question
was a result of negligence

06:00.935 --> 06:02.061
on the part of the employer.

06:02.136 --> 06:04.366
The court finds for the Tip Top
Construction Company

06:04.439 --> 06:05.497
and against Mr. Sullivan.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.440
Sully... Sully?

06:10.378 --> 06:13.211
I should've known better than
to hire a one-legged lawyer.

06:13.281 --> 06:15.146
Well, you can't afford
a two-legged lawyer.

06:15.216 --> 06:17.047
Don't get discouraged, okay?

06:17.118 --> 06:20.144
It's a temporary setback...
that's all.

06:20.221 --> 06:21.950
You've got to remember
our strategy.

06:22.023 --> 06:25.982
Strategy? That's the first
I ever heard of any strategy.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.426
Sooner or later, we'll
wear the bastards down.

06:28.496 --> 06:30.191
The court is
already starting

06:30.265 --> 06:31.163
to get pissed.

06:31.232 --> 06:32.426
You heard the judge.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.058
He's pissed at you, Wirf.

06:34.135 --> 06:36.467
Only because he knows
I won't go away.

06:36.537 --> 06:38.596
I know how he feels.

07:06.234 --> 07:07.360
He called in sick,

07:07.435 --> 07:09.027
he's on the phone,
he's in the Bahamas...

07:09.137 --> 07:11.435
Take your pick...
he doesn't want to see you.

07:13.441 --> 07:15.466
The Bahamas sound swell.

07:15.543 --> 07:16.942
Ruby, grab his checkbook.

07:17.011 --> 07:17.943
We'll take off.

07:18.012 --> 07:19.070
There's about 1,000
other guys

07:19.147 --> 07:20.978
I would take with me
before you.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.107
Thanks, honey.

07:25.453 --> 07:27.683
I heard the judge threw you
and that two-bit lawsuit

07:27.755 --> 07:29.052
out of court.

07:29.123 --> 07:31.318
Hope you didn't have to pay him
more than you owed me.

07:31.392 --> 07:32.324
Aw, Sully,
don't be bitter.

07:32.393 --> 07:33.325
America's a great place.

07:33.394 --> 07:34.520
Where else could a cripple

07:34.595 --> 07:37.359
and a drunk, one-legged lawyer
even get to talk to a judge?

07:37.432 --> 07:40.196
Good news is I got a job
even you can't screw up.

07:40.268 --> 07:41.565
I told you I'm not
working for you

07:41.636 --> 07:42.933
till you pay me what you owe me.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.006
Forget about it. You were
working off the books, okay?

07:45.006 --> 07:46.735
You don't hire anybody
unless they work off the books.

07:46.974 --> 07:47.440
And you won't work

07:47.508 --> 07:49.271
except off the books, Sully.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.141
Think you got a right
to steal from anybody

07:51.245 --> 07:52.439
that's got a couple bucks
in their pocket?

07:52.513 --> 07:54.276
Huh? I'm supposed to assume

07:54.349 --> 07:57.079
the position just 'cause you got
a bum knee and no prospects?

07:57.151 --> 07:59.142
Bullshit.

07:59.253 --> 08:00.618
Besides, you did shoddy work,
okay.

08:00.722 --> 08:02.383
- You think I got where I got...
- What?

08:02.457 --> 08:03.481
...by doing shoddy work?

08:03.558 --> 08:05.355
No.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.685
You didn't get where you are
by doing shoddy work.

08:08.930 --> 08:11.262
You didn't get where you are
by doing any work.

08:11.332 --> 08:14.460
You got where you are because
your daddy gave it to you,

08:14.535 --> 08:16.526
and he drove himself into an
early grave so you could

08:16.604 --> 08:18.595
piss it away
on ski trips and sports cars.

08:18.673 --> 08:20.903
I haven't been skiing
in two years, Sully.

08:20.975 --> 08:22.408
Hey, look, personally,
I don't give a goddamn whether

08:22.510 --> 08:24.273
you go broke, which you probably
will, but before you do,

08:24.345 --> 08:25.437
you're going to pay me
what you owe me.

08:25.513 --> 08:26.605
I'm not going to pay you.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.942
I don't owe you a goddamn cent.

08:28.015 --> 08:29.073
I'm going to come through
that goddamn door,

08:29.150 --> 08:29.582
I'm going to grab you

08:29.650 --> 08:30.639
by your pin head,

08:30.718 --> 08:32.686
and I'm going to throw you
out the window.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.183
Five... four...

08:38.259 --> 08:40.250
three... two... one.

08:42.663 --> 08:44.358
What kind of work?

09:11.492 --> 09:13.221
Ooh...

09:13.294 --> 09:15.023
Oh.

09:19.634 --> 09:21.499
Shit.

09:45.526 --> 09:47.050
Dad?

09:47.161 --> 09:49.220
Peter?

09:49.297 --> 09:52.289
You need a lift?

09:54.168 --> 09:56.068
All right.

10:05.079 --> 10:07.047
Well, been a while.

10:07.114 --> 10:09.116
Three years.

10:09.116 --> 10:11.016
Weren't you supposed to be
working at teaching...

10:11.085 --> 10:11.642
what's that school?

10:11.719 --> 10:13.516
University of West Virginia.

10:13.588 --> 10:16.113
Oh, yeah.

10:16.190 --> 10:17.748
What brings you guys
this far north?

10:17.825 --> 10:19.087
Vera.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.753
Welcome to the Thanksgiving
from hell.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.024
Goddamn it, Charlotte,

10:24.098 --> 10:26.430
if we're going to start
the weekend like this...

10:26.501 --> 10:29.095
Oh, Vera...
how is she, anyway?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.102
I don't think I've seen her

10:30.171 --> 10:31.195
since the last time
you guys were up here.

10:31.272 --> 10:32.330
Well, now,

10:32.406 --> 10:33.737
how can you live
in a town this size

10:33.808 --> 10:35.435
and not see your ex-wife
all the time?

10:35.510 --> 10:36.636
That's easy, darling.

10:36.711 --> 10:40.340
Peter's mom and I don't exactly
travel in the same circles.

10:40.414 --> 10:42.382
As a matter of fact,

10:42.483 --> 10:44.542
Vera pretty much travels
in a straight line.

10:44.619 --> 10:46.587
Somebody in this family had to.

10:46.654 --> 10:48.383
Who are you?

10:48.456 --> 10:49.354
He's your grandfather.

10:49.423 --> 10:52.256
Does he always look like that?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.418
Yeah, most of the time.

10:53.494 --> 10:55.189
How come
they call you "Wacker"?

10:57.865 --> 10:58.490
Wacker!

10:58.566 --> 10:59.624
I didn't do anything.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.325
You okay?

11:00.401 --> 11:01.197
He hit him.

11:01.335 --> 11:02.324
- Stop the car.
- You what?

11:02.403 --> 11:03.335
I did not.

11:03.404 --> 11:04.496
- What happened?
- Did so.

11:04.572 --> 11:05.766
Stop before
I throw that little

11:06.007 --> 11:07.167
son of a bitch out.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.767
Sweetie...

11:11.012 --> 11:12.502
Go get your dad and see
if he's okay.

11:12.580 --> 11:13.979
Would somebody tell me
what's going on?

11:14.048 --> 11:15.413
What do you think, Peter?

11:15.483 --> 11:16.450
Go get your dad.

11:16.517 --> 11:17.449
All right, all right.

11:17.785 --> 11:18.615
I'm going, okay.

11:18.686 --> 11:19.618
Why are you always hitting?

11:19.687 --> 11:22.781
What the hell happened, Dad?

11:23.024 --> 11:24.286
What's the matter?

11:26.027 --> 11:28.518
Jesus Christ.

11:28.596 --> 11:30.154
Wacker did that?

11:30.231 --> 11:31.357
Oh, don't be a jerk.

11:33.167 --> 11:34.395
I fell off a scaffold
about six months ago.

11:34.468 --> 11:37.062
Have you seen a doctor?

11:37.138 --> 11:38.127
Yeah, saw about 20 of them.

11:38.205 --> 11:39.172
What'd they say?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.299
About 20 different things.

11:44.211 --> 11:45.405
Well, thanks for the lift.

11:45.479 --> 11:46.571
Look, get back in the car.

11:46.647 --> 11:48.410
I-I'll take you
wherever you want to go.

11:48.482 --> 11:51.178
Oh, no.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.685
See you around.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.551
You sure you're okay?

11:55.623 --> 11:58.057
Oh, I'm good, I'm good.

11:58.125 --> 11:59.285
Don't worry about it.

11:59.393 --> 12:00.690
Hey, listen...

12:00.761 --> 12:04.527
why don't you stop by Mom's
tomorrow?

12:04.599 --> 12:08.035
Huh? Better ask Vera
about that.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.467
I don't have to ask permission

12:09.537 --> 12:11.732
to invite my own father
to Thanksgiving dinner.

12:11.806 --> 12:13.774
I'll think about it.

12:31.092 --> 12:32.582
Hey.

12:32.660 --> 12:33.456
Yeah?

12:33.527 --> 12:36.155
You ain't naked or anything,
are you?

12:36.230 --> 12:38.824
No, but I can be
in about two seconds.

12:39.066 --> 12:40.658
Eh, take your time.

12:40.735 --> 12:43.329
I need a cup of coffee.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.374
East Towing? Sullivan.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.811
Yeah, uh, I'm just
around the corner:

12:50.811 --> 12:52.506
313 Harmon.

12:52.580 --> 12:53.774
Pick me up.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.684
Hey... charge it.

12:57.752 --> 13:00.220
Tip Top Construction Company.

13:00.287 --> 13:02.221
Bye.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.349
Horace?

13:06.427 --> 13:08.622
Hi, Sully. I ain't naked either.

13:08.696 --> 13:10.288
Oh, thank God for that.

13:12.233 --> 13:14.565
Lord, how does a man
get that dirty?

13:14.635 --> 13:16.330
Working for your husband.

13:16.404 --> 13:20.431
I thought you were never
going to work for Carl again.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.271
Aw, it's just temporary.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.537
Here's your keys.

13:23.611 --> 13:25.772
I wish I hadn't of let you
talk me into doing this.

13:25.846 --> 13:29.043
Oh, well. I'd cash it
as quickly as possible.

13:29.116 --> 13:30.310
Thanks, Mr. Yancy.

13:30.384 --> 13:31.749
Hey, while you got
your checkbook out,

13:31.819 --> 13:33.548
why don't you pay me
what your husband owes me?

13:33.621 --> 13:35.054
Dummy and I ironed
the whole thing out

13:35.122 --> 13:36.680
down at the office,
but all he had

13:36.757 --> 13:39.089
was a company checkbook, see?
So he, um...

13:39.160 --> 13:40.491
Nice try, Sully.

13:40.561 --> 13:41.789
He does owe me.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.489
Well, get in line.

13:43.564 --> 13:45.225
He owes everybody.

13:45.299 --> 13:48.530
You take a big pile of money,
and you go have a heart bypass...

13:48.602 --> 13:51.264
see how much money
you have left after that.

13:55.609 --> 13:57.099
What's going on?

13:57.178 --> 13:58.668
Changed the locks,
and throwing out his clothes.

13:58.746 --> 14:01.977
As far as I'm concerned,
he no longer lives here.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.540
It's a bold move.

14:04.618 --> 14:06.449
Won't work.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.987
It might get his attention.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.491
Well, maybe it will,
and maybe it won't.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.550
You know...
when my trifecta comes in,

14:13.627 --> 14:15.458
why don't you dump
what's-his-name

14:15.529 --> 14:17.087
and run away with me?

14:19.100 --> 14:21.159
Where would we go?

14:21.235 --> 14:24.762
Hawaii. Someplace
where it's warm.

14:24.839 --> 14:26.773
You know, where they got
umbrellas in the drinks.

14:26.841 --> 14:30.777
Where they rub you
with coconut oil.

14:40.321 --> 14:41.788
Got to go.

14:45.726 --> 14:47.250
Hang in there.

14:47.328 --> 14:49.193
Hang in there?

14:49.263 --> 14:51.561
That's it? That's the sum
of your wisdom on the subject?

14:51.632 --> 14:54.100
It's the sum of my wisdom
on most subjects.

15:14.722 --> 15:16.290
Hey, there you are.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.292
Where the hell have you been?

15:18.292 --> 15:20.726
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

15:20.795 --> 15:23.025
Well, you should have given up.

15:23.097 --> 15:24.155
Aces over.

15:24.231 --> 15:25.459
Three tens.

15:27.168 --> 15:28.533
Phooey!

15:28.602 --> 15:29.830
Deal me in.

15:31.872 --> 15:35.467
I sure do like a woman
whose love ain't for sale.

15:35.576 --> 15:37.339
Screw you, Sully.

15:37.411 --> 15:39.072
Got to go tinkle.

15:39.146 --> 15:40.579
Mm-hmm.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.546
Ruby?

15:41.615 --> 15:43.310
What now?

15:43.384 --> 15:45.443
Don't take your love to town.

15:45.519 --> 15:48.784
Ruby...

15:48.856 --> 15:51.222
Don't take your love
to town.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.054
For God's sakes,
turn around.

15:53.127 --> 15:54.754
Have a little respect, fellas.

15:55.796 --> 15:57.058
Look, I know

15:57.131 --> 15:58.866
we didn't do
so good today, but, uh...

15:58.866 --> 16:00.356
there's a zillion
things we can try.

16:00.434 --> 16:01.836
Nope.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.202
When was the last time
you won a case, Wirf?

16:04.271 --> 16:06.364
What's that got
to do with anything?

16:06.440 --> 16:07.498
Cut.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.099
Gray river

16:09.176 --> 16:10.734
around a green monkey's ass.

16:10.811 --> 16:13.507
You know, Sully,
you're the only guy I know

16:13.581 --> 16:16.015
still dumb enough
to believe in luck.

16:16.083 --> 16:19.644
I used to believe in brains
and hard work till I met you.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.449
Deal.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.387
Seven card.

16:23.457 --> 16:25.322
Which one of your
fancy doctors advised you

16:25.392 --> 16:27.292
to drink, smoke
and screw your brains out?

16:27.361 --> 16:29.090
Those are unreasonable
requests, Sully.

16:29.163 --> 16:31.427
They wouldn't have made them
if they didn't know me.

16:31.498 --> 16:33.523
If they had known you,
they wouldn't have fixed you.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.535
King bets.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.127
Last call.

16:39.506 --> 16:41.497
You want to Sheetrock
one of them houses for me

16:41.575 --> 16:42.667
over on Nelson tomorrow?

16:42.743 --> 16:43.835
Hey, I thought you said

16:44.078 --> 16:46.171
you were never going
to work for Carl again.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.645
Shut up, Rub.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.683
Sheetrock is a two-man job.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.718
What about it, rubber head?

16:51.785 --> 16:53.582
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

16:53.654 --> 16:55.656
I won't work on Thanksgiving.

16:55.656 --> 16:56.486
Sure, you will.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.081
Hmm...

16:58.158 --> 16:59.125
Double time.

16:59.193 --> 17:00.353
In your dreams.

17:00.427 --> 17:02.122
Oh, Sheetrock
the son of a bitch yourself.

17:02.196 --> 17:03.686
Why should I pay you
double time, Sully?

17:03.764 --> 17:04.788
Hey, what's tomorrow, Rub?

17:05.031 --> 17:07.090
It's fucking Thanksgiving.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.666
Know what burns my ass, Sully?

17:08.736 --> 17:11.068
You wouldn't even know
it was Thanksgiving

17:11.137 --> 17:12.195
if it wasn't for Rub.

17:12.306 --> 17:14.773
Know enough to know
that it's double time. Five.

17:14.842 --> 17:17.071
Know what Thanksgiving is?

17:17.144 --> 17:18.509
Down and dirty.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.445
Thanksgiving is a time
for normal people, Sully,

17:21.515 --> 17:24.678
to do normal things...
to be in the bosom

17:24.752 --> 17:26.083
of their family.

17:26.153 --> 17:28.815
And that, my friend,
is not you.

17:28.889 --> 17:31.153
It's still going
to be double time.

17:31.225 --> 17:32.317
Yeah. Sheetrock

17:32.393 --> 17:34.122
the son of a bitch yourself.

17:34.194 --> 17:36.128
Bet's to you, Jocko.

17:36.196 --> 17:37.788
Ten.

17:37.865 --> 17:39.127
Well, I'm out.

17:41.902 --> 17:44.200
What's wrong with you?

17:44.305 --> 17:47.206
I'm trying to communicate
with you telepathically.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.571
Forget about it.

17:48.642 --> 17:51.133
Only way to communicate
with Sully

17:51.211 --> 17:53.645
is to whack him
in the head with a shovel.

17:53.714 --> 17:55.238
It's your bet, genius.

17:55.316 --> 17:56.681
15.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.274
Call.

17:59.853 --> 18:01.445
Call.

18:03.757 --> 18:06.385
Eights full.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.392
All the nines.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.091
Jesus H. Christ.

18:12.166 --> 18:15.226
I was trying
to tell you to fold.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.600
Cash me in, Jocko.
You know, Rub,

18:17.671 --> 18:19.263
I think your
supervisor here

18:19.340 --> 18:21.365
is in for a little
rude awakening.

18:21.442 --> 18:23.501
Tomorrow morning,
about 7:00 a.m.,

18:23.577 --> 18:25.169
he's going to be out there

18:25.245 --> 18:27.440
shoveling old
Miss Beryl's driveway,

18:27.514 --> 18:29.812
ten below, fingers freezing.

18:29.883 --> 18:32.351
Then, all of a sudden,
it's going to occur to him,

18:32.419 --> 18:33.511
"Hey, I could be indoors

18:33.587 --> 18:35.316
"working where
it's nice and warm...

18:35.389 --> 18:36.788
"working with
my old buddy Rub.

18:36.857 --> 18:39.121
"I know what I'll do...
call my good friend,

18:39.193 --> 18:41.252
"Honest Carl Roebuck...
take him up on that

18:41.362 --> 18:43.057
"Sheetrocking job
he offered me...

18:43.130 --> 18:46.463
maybe earn back some of my money
I lost playing cards."

18:46.533 --> 18:48.296
But you know what?

18:48.369 --> 18:50.200
By tomorrow...

18:50.337 --> 18:52.669
it's going to be
too fucking late.

18:54.141 --> 18:55.665
Think about it, schmucko.

19:22.403 --> 19:25.099
That you, Sully?

19:25.172 --> 19:26.537
Yeah.

19:26.607 --> 19:29.337
Did you come to steal
our new snowblower?

19:30.644 --> 19:33.477
I've done it already,
just about.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.380
I could legally shoot you,
and get away with it.

19:36.450 --> 19:39.351
Not unless I'm breaking
and entering.

19:39.420 --> 19:42.617
Are you going
to break and enter?

19:44.258 --> 19:46.749
So, what's happening with Dummy?

19:46.827 --> 19:48.294
I don't know.

19:48.362 --> 19:49.761
He took my threat to shoot him

19:49.830 --> 19:51.798
a lot more seriously
than you just did.

19:51.865 --> 19:53.230
The poor guy

19:53.333 --> 19:54.527
just had a bypass.

19:54.601 --> 19:56.125
Maybe he's trying

19:56.203 --> 19:58.467
to cram everything he can do
into six months.

19:58.539 --> 20:01.235
When he realizes he's going
to live until he's 70,

20:01.308 --> 20:02.639
he'll slow down.

20:02.709 --> 20:04.836
If I had my way, he wouldn't
live till Thanksgiving.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.379
Go ahead...
steal our snowblower.

20:06.447 --> 20:09.905
You're the slowest
goddamn thief I ever saw.

21:04.738 --> 21:06.672
Sully, give me a light.

21:06.740 --> 21:08.230
Huh?

21:09.309 --> 21:10.708
Give me a light.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.811
Go home, you jerk.

21:14.882 --> 21:18.682
You're married to the best-
looking woman in Bath.

21:18.752 --> 21:22.279
Who was it said, "A man's reach
should exceed his grasp"?

21:22.356 --> 21:24.153
And tell her
you love her, huh?

21:24.224 --> 21:25.555
Or else I will.

21:25.626 --> 21:27.560
God, Sully...

21:27.628 --> 21:30.688
I sure hope I don't
end up like you.

21:30.764 --> 21:32.288
I hope you don't either.

21:32.366 --> 21:34.596
60 years old, and
still getting crushes

21:34.668 --> 21:35.862
on other men's wives.

21:35.936 --> 21:38.234
I would hope, by the time
I'm your age,

21:38.305 --> 21:39.738
I'm a little
smarter than that.

21:39.806 --> 21:41.398
Can't hurt to hope.

21:41.475 --> 21:43.534
You sure are off
to a slow start.

21:51.718 --> 21:53.845
You know, I got one
just like that.

21:58.825 --> 22:00.793
Identical.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.640
Does this mean

22:14.708 --> 22:16.573
you're finally
going to get around

22:16.643 --> 22:18.133
to fixing my porch railing?

22:19.580 --> 22:21.241
I'll do it today, I promise.

22:23.617 --> 22:26.848
Do you mind my asking
what you are doing?

22:26.920 --> 22:29.286
I'm keeping the guy
that I stole this from

22:29.356 --> 22:30.584
from stealing it back.

22:30.657 --> 22:32.420
Donald,

22:32.492 --> 22:33.754
does it ever bother you

22:33.827 --> 22:37.228
that you haven't done more
with the life God gave you?

22:37.297 --> 22:39.891
Not often.

22:39.967 --> 22:42.333
Now and then.

22:48.442 --> 22:49.670
And it's not just
the theme park...

22:49.743 --> 22:51.574
it's all the businesses
that go along with it.

22:51.645 --> 22:52.577
How are you?

22:52.646 --> 22:53.874
Hotels, restaurants,
gas stations.

22:53.947 --> 22:55.938
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Do you people have any idea

22:56.016 --> 22:58.678
what property values
are going to go to around here?

22:58.752 --> 22:59.886
Why, just this morning,

22:59.886 --> 23:02.719
Mr. Lomax and I were talking
on the phone, and he said...

23:02.789 --> 23:03.881
Well, C.W., do you mind

23:03.957 --> 23:05.857
telling these people
what you told me?

23:05.926 --> 23:07.723
The fact is, Clive Jr.,
we're talking

23:07.794 --> 23:09.887
about an initial investment
of 100 million.

23:09.963 --> 23:11.191
Oh, Joe.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.358
That's just for starters.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.829
Well, uh, ladies and gentlemen,

23:15.902 --> 23:17.267
I think they want us to go up.

23:17.337 --> 23:18.634
Mother?

23:18.705 --> 23:19.865
Oh, yes, I will say

23:19.940 --> 23:22.932
that I certainly have
appreciated your hospitality.

23:23.176 --> 23:26.509
Clive has been just wonderful
through all of this.

23:26.580 --> 23:29.310
I couldn't have done any of it
without him.

23:29.383 --> 23:32.409
You must be very proud
of your son.

23:32.486 --> 23:34.545
Actually, he's not really
my son.

23:34.621 --> 23:37.146
They switched bassinets
in the hospital.

23:37.257 --> 23:39.555
It's a long story, Clive.

23:41.361 --> 23:43.727
She's just kidding.

23:43.797 --> 23:47.324
So now, the Dolphins will
set up to kick.

23:47.434 --> 23:48.765
Dallas, back deep to return

23:48.835 --> 23:50.598
for the Cowboys...
Williams and...

23:50.671 --> 23:52.866
Want some help?

23:52.939 --> 23:53.837
No.

23:55.742 --> 23:58.267
Mom...

23:58.345 --> 24:00.404
uh...

24:00.480 --> 24:04.314
Charlotte wants us
to leave in the morning.

24:04.384 --> 24:05.578
It's just it's...

24:05.652 --> 24:07.620
We're not doing too well.

24:07.688 --> 24:11.590
Being here makes it worse.

24:12.793 --> 24:14.488
You know who I blame for this?

24:14.561 --> 24:15.892
Donald Sullivan.

24:15.962 --> 24:17.190
Mom...

24:17.264 --> 24:19.266
There was a show on Oprah
the other day

24:19.266 --> 24:22.235
about men
who can't face responsibility.

24:22.302 --> 24:25.703
About how they had destroyed
their children's lives.

24:25.772 --> 24:30.436
I promise you,
it fit Donald Sullivan to a T.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.944
There's one thing
Oprah understands.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.272
It's men.

24:34.348 --> 24:36.316
What's that truck doing
out there?

24:43.523 --> 24:45.457
Dad!

24:48.195 --> 24:49.685
Hey, how are you?

24:49.763 --> 24:50.855
I'm sorry I'm late.

24:50.931 --> 24:52.899
I just got here.

24:54.401 --> 24:55.925
Shit.

24:56.002 --> 24:58.266
Ten. He's going
to dive to the goal.

24:58.338 --> 25:00.306
Touchdown... Miami!

25:02.342 --> 25:05.140
Sully, is that you?

25:05.212 --> 25:06.509
Hey.

25:06.580 --> 25:08.241
What a surprise.

25:08.315 --> 25:11.409
Vera will be tickled pink
to see you.

25:11.485 --> 25:13.282
Your mother doesn't know
I'm coming?

25:13.387 --> 25:15.287
I didn't think
you'd really show up.

25:15.355 --> 25:17.758
Vera, guess who's here.

25:17.758 --> 25:19.282
I'll be right there.

25:19.426 --> 25:21.860
What's taking you so long?

25:21.928 --> 25:23.589
I have to pee.

25:24.798 --> 25:26.732
Out of the way, doofus.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.324
Wacker!

25:30.904 --> 25:33.304
Wacker,
I'm warning you.

25:33.373 --> 25:36.865
Uh... listen, uh... I forgot
something in the garage.

25:36.943 --> 25:38.672
Yeah. I... I'd better
check on Charlotte.

25:38.745 --> 25:41.179
The snap is high,
the kick is up, it's good!

25:42.883 --> 25:44.680
I really mean it
this time, Wacker.

25:48.288 --> 25:49.653
Sully.

25:52.459 --> 25:54.620
Happy Thanksgiving.

25:54.694 --> 25:56.218
Mommy!

25:57.597 --> 26:01.226
Wacker, no. Um... Wacker...
no, uh...!

26:02.669 --> 26:04.227
Hey, come out of there now,
Will.

26:04.337 --> 26:05.463
What are you doing here?

26:05.539 --> 26:06.699
Open the door right now!

26:06.773 --> 26:07.831
- I mean it.
- What's the matter, sweetie?

26:07.908 --> 26:09.808
What happened?
Oh, what did you do to him?

26:09.876 --> 26:11.867
What did I do to him?
What did he do to me?

26:11.945 --> 26:13.936
What did he do
to my mother's china?

26:14.181 --> 26:15.341
Charlotte, for God's sake!

26:15.415 --> 26:16.575
Don't "For God's sake,

26:16.650 --> 26:17.947
Charlotte" me!
What did you do to him?

26:18.185 --> 26:18.947
I beg your pardon.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.676
This is all your fault.

26:21.755 --> 26:22.915
All right, Will,

26:22.989 --> 26:25.150
I'm going to count to ten.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.157
...three...

27:07.267 --> 27:09.235
What's the matter now, Raymer?

27:09.302 --> 27:11.236
Broken tail light.
This is the third time.

27:11.304 --> 27:14.137
One more time, Sully, and I'm
impounding this heap of yours.

27:14.207 --> 27:15.572
Jesus Christ.

27:15.642 --> 27:17.132
Raymer, it's Thanksgiving.

27:17.210 --> 27:18.178
Yeah, well,
if you'd fixed it

27:18.178 --> 27:19.406
the first time,
this wouldn't happen.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.679
That's $15.

27:26.753 --> 27:28.721
You can mail it in or you
can come by the station.

27:28.788 --> 27:31.848
If it's not paid within 30 days,
you'll be held in contempt.

27:31.925 --> 27:34.427
Boy, I hope you
get laid sometime soon.

27:34.427 --> 27:37.555
You know, someday, smartass,
I'm going to nail you...

27:37.631 --> 27:39.895
when you least expect it.

28:03.323 --> 28:05.154
You okay?

28:07.327 --> 28:08.885
Uh...

28:08.962 --> 28:10.395
Will.

28:10.463 --> 28:11.589
Yeah, Will.

28:11.665 --> 28:12.825
Is he dead?

28:12.899 --> 28:13.923
Who?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.968
Wacker.

28:16.202 --> 28:18.932
No, but he's pretty bent
out of shape.

28:19.005 --> 28:21.473
You better come
and sit up front with me.

28:21.541 --> 28:24.601
Come on.
There you go. Yeah.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.292
Hello.

28:41.361 --> 28:43.261
Missing anybody?

28:43.330 --> 28:45.821
Oh, thank God. Where are you?

28:45.899 --> 28:47.423
Cozy Corner.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.865
Okay, I'll be right there.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.605
Thank you.

29:03.583 --> 29:06.347
You and Wacker fight
all the time?

29:06.419 --> 29:09.582
Sometimes.

29:09.656 --> 29:12.181
At least you got even.
That's something.

29:12.258 --> 29:14.226
When Mom and Dad
get divorced...

29:14.294 --> 29:15.488
Divorced?

29:15.562 --> 29:17.189
When Mom and Dad get divorced,

29:17.263 --> 29:19.197
I'm going to go
and live with my dad,

29:19.265 --> 29:22.359
and Wacker will
go and live with Mom.

29:22.435 --> 29:24.562
She'll find out
how really bad Wacker is.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.367
Yeah?

29:26.439 --> 29:28.930
And when Mom and Dad
get back together,

29:29.009 --> 29:30.977
everything will be different.

29:33.279 --> 29:36.180
We'll live in a house
instead of an apartment,

29:36.249 --> 29:37.773
and I'll have my own room,

29:37.851 --> 29:40.752
and Wacker won't be able
to play with my toys

29:40.820 --> 29:43.380
unless I say so.

29:44.991 --> 29:48.518
And Mom and Dad
won't argue anymore,

29:48.595 --> 29:51.758
or fight about money
or anything.

30:04.778 --> 30:06.302
Hey, pal.

30:06.379 --> 30:07.744
Hi, Dad.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.611
Thanks for calling.

30:10.684 --> 30:12.515
The, uh... situation

30:12.585 --> 30:14.883
at the house
has just gone ballistic.

30:14.954 --> 30:16.615
What's with you and Charlotte?

30:16.690 --> 30:19.921
Sometimes I think you did
the smart thing...

30:19.993 --> 30:21.927
just running away.

30:21.995 --> 30:24.725
I only got about five blocks.

30:24.798 --> 30:26.925
Well, you might as well
have gone to the moon.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.936
You trying to get me
to say I'm sorry?

30:31.004 --> 30:33.268
No. I know better than that.

30:33.339 --> 30:35.569
Come on, pal.

30:35.642 --> 30:37.439
Let's go.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.371
Tell me something.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.384
Do you ever even think about me?

30:45.452 --> 30:49.513
I guess, sometimes. Yeah.

30:49.589 --> 30:52.456
Well, I thought
about you all the time.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.041
Hiya!

32:21.281 --> 32:22.682
Hi.

32:22.682 --> 32:24.616
Come on in, Sully.

32:24.684 --> 32:27.346
Come on. Take a load off.

32:27.453 --> 32:30.445
This is men's night
at Casa Roebuck.

32:30.523 --> 32:33.253
We're drinking from the bottle.

32:37.864 --> 32:39.764
Where's Dummy?

32:39.833 --> 32:41.664
Where's Ruby?

32:45.038 --> 32:47.563
Why does he do it?

32:47.640 --> 32:50.336
Well, he's not in love with her,
if that's what you mean.

32:50.410 --> 32:53.379
Hey, I don't
know the reason

32:53.446 --> 32:55.004
why I do half the things
that I do,

32:55.081 --> 32:56.673
let alone your dimwit husband.

32:56.749 --> 32:58.649
Well, did you ever get so mad

32:58.718 --> 33:00.743
that you wanted
to shoot somebody?

33:00.854 --> 33:03.948
That's why I don't carry a gun.

33:04.023 --> 33:05.684
Well, maybe we should go out

33:05.758 --> 33:08.727
and buy a couple
of.357 Magnums and rob banks...

33:08.795 --> 33:10.319
like Bonnie and Clyde.

33:10.396 --> 33:12.887
Just you and me.

33:12.966 --> 33:16.060
Well, you'd have to be Clyde.

33:16.302 --> 33:17.735
I'm too tired.

33:19.072 --> 33:20.562
You always cheer me up.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.666
I think it's because
you're the only person I know

33:23.743 --> 33:25.301
who's worse off than me.

33:25.378 --> 33:30.816
Nah. It's because...
deep down, secretly...

33:30.884 --> 33:33.011
you're in love with me.

33:33.086 --> 33:35.281
Really?

33:38.024 --> 33:40.288
You betcha.

33:42.462 --> 33:44.589
I guess we'll never know.

33:44.664 --> 33:47.428
Not at the rate
we're going.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.367
Well, if you're not in love
with me, I'm going home.

33:51.671 --> 33:55.437
Oh, where did numbnuts hide
the snowblower?

33:55.508 --> 33:57.703
Over at the Tip Top.

33:57.777 --> 34:00.769
Huh. I'll steal it
back again tomorrow...

34:00.847 --> 34:02.508
or the next day.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.947
Watch out

34:04.017 --> 34:05.609
for that mean-ass dog.

34:05.685 --> 34:07.050
Not worried about the dog.

34:07.287 --> 34:10.016
I'm worried about whether
I can get over that fence

34:10.089 --> 34:11.750
with one leg.

34:11.824 --> 34:16.887
Oh, you're a man
among men, Sully.

34:16.963 --> 34:18.590
Well, thanks.

34:18.665 --> 34:21.690
That wasn't a compliment.

34:38.885 --> 34:40.819
I know you don't like the idea,

34:40.887 --> 34:43.047
but you should
sell this place

34:43.121 --> 34:44.350
and let me invest the money

34:44.424 --> 34:45.822
in real estate
out by the theme park.

34:45.891 --> 34:48.588
There's big money
headed this way.

34:48.661 --> 34:50.025
Serious money.

34:50.096 --> 34:51.927
This could
be the new Gold Coast.

34:51.998 --> 34:53.397
You're right...

34:53.466 --> 34:54.728
I don't like the idea.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.768
Besides, I can't sell
this place.

34:56.835 --> 34:58.838
I have a tenant.

34:58.838 --> 35:01.466
That's another thing.

35:01.541 --> 35:03.509
Sully has to go.

35:03.576 --> 35:04.736
I was up there last night.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.836
You should see that
place for yourself...

35:06.913 --> 35:08.278
countless cigarette burns.

35:08.348 --> 35:10.509
This house could go up
in flames any minute.

35:10.583 --> 35:11.914
Clive, you know Mr. Sullivan

35:11.985 --> 35:13.748
does not like
you snooping around.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.481
I wasn't snooping around.

35:15.555 --> 35:17.853
I was just looking
after my mother's interest,

35:17.924 --> 35:19.721
which is more
than she'll do for herself.

35:19.792 --> 35:21.020
I mean, keeping
this house is

35:21.094 --> 35:24.655
lunatic enough without having
a pyromaniac for a tenant.

35:24.731 --> 35:28.633
Why is it that everyone in town
can see through him except you?

35:28.701 --> 35:31.670
Oh, dear God in heaven.

35:31.738 --> 35:34.468
Mr. Sullivan! Mr. Sullivan!

35:34.540 --> 35:36.371
Mother, what is it?

35:36.509 --> 35:38.374
Mother, what is it?

35:38.478 --> 35:39.672
What's the matter?

35:39.746 --> 35:41.373
Mr. Sullivan,
come quickly!

35:41.447 --> 35:43.813
It's Miss Hattie!

35:43.883 --> 35:45.942
Mother,
I'll take care of it.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.008
Thank heavens

35:47.086 --> 35:48.553
you're still here.

35:48.621 --> 35:50.384
Hattie's escaped again.

35:50.456 --> 35:52.424
Stay put. I'll get her.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.891
Hurry. She's in
the middle of the street.

35:54.961 --> 35:56.690
Hurry is not what I do best.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.424
I'm looking
for my muffler.

35:58.498 --> 35:59.863
Is that The Bank?

35:59.932 --> 36:01.900
Tell him he's in trouble.

36:01.968 --> 36:02.491
Hurry.

36:02.568 --> 36:03.500
I am hurrying.

36:03.569 --> 36:04.729
It just looks
like slow motion.

36:10.109 --> 36:13.636
No driving on the sidewalk.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.056
Hi, good-looking.

36:27.126 --> 36:28.821
You running away
from home?

36:29.862 --> 36:31.796
Where you headed?

36:31.864 --> 36:33.798
To my sister's in Albany.

36:33.866 --> 36:35.993
Ah. Let me
give you a lift.

36:36.069 --> 36:38.799
I think you'll
get there quicker.

36:38.871 --> 36:40.566
Okay.

36:43.042 --> 36:45.670
Listen, what say you
and me go dancing some night?

36:45.745 --> 36:47.110
Dancing?

36:47.346 --> 36:48.836
Yeah. Just you and me.

36:54.687 --> 36:56.382
Hey, Sully.

36:56.456 --> 36:57.946
Hi, Jake.

36:58.024 --> 36:58.991
How you doing, Sully?

36:59.058 --> 37:00.923
There you go,
safe and sound.

37:00.993 --> 37:02.585
Oh, God.

37:02.662 --> 37:03.686
Oh, Ma.

37:03.763 --> 37:06.823
What gets into you?

37:06.899 --> 37:07.888
Thanks, Sully.

37:09.802 --> 37:10.803
Yeah.

37:10.803 --> 37:11.804
Just take care
of things, okay,

37:11.804 --> 37:12.862
while I look after Mom.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.338
Well, Rufus,

37:14.440 --> 37:17.432
I guess it's just you and me.

37:17.510 --> 37:19.341
Here... these go to Jocko.
He takes ketchup.

37:19.445 --> 37:20.935
I don't get time
for a cup of coffee?

37:25.718 --> 37:26.878
Sully.

37:28.921 --> 37:30.912
Give these to Jocko
in the second booth.

37:30.990 --> 37:32.048
I want to talk to you.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.092
Hey.

37:39.899 --> 37:41.491
I could've...

37:41.567 --> 37:42.864
Takes ketchup.

37:44.637 --> 37:45.899
I could've handled
that business.

37:45.972 --> 37:46.904
I didn't need

37:46.973 --> 37:47.962
your interference.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.974
How was your Thanksgiving,
Clive?

37:50.042 --> 37:51.407
You have a nice day?

37:51.477 --> 37:52.879
What'd you do?

37:52.879 --> 37:54.676
Uh... nothing, nothing much.

37:54.747 --> 37:57.113
I, uh... just had dinner
with my mother.

37:57.350 --> 37:58.715
Nothing much, huh?

37:58.784 --> 38:00.012
I thought maybe
you were someplace

38:00.086 --> 38:01.246
you shouldn't have been.

38:06.659 --> 38:07.990
We've been
through this before.

38:08.060 --> 38:09.254
A landlord has...

38:09.328 --> 38:10.317
You are not my landlord.

38:10.429 --> 38:11.327
My mother is your...

38:11.430 --> 38:12.624
Is the only reason
I don't kick your ass.

38:12.698 --> 38:14.928
You don't get out
of here right now,

38:15.001 --> 38:16.025
I may change my mind.

38:25.878 --> 38:28.369
Hey, the ketchup stays here.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.911
Judge Wapner's verdict
is coming right up.

38:37.924 --> 38:40.654
First of all, I'm certainly
sorry that the bird died...

38:40.726 --> 38:42.353
there's no question about that.

38:42.428 --> 38:45.591
We... sympathy is with you,
but we don't decide cases

38:45.665 --> 38:47.428
on the basis of sympathy.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.695
Hey, Birdy, you got any aspirin?

38:49.769 --> 38:50.861
Is it your knee?

38:50.937 --> 38:52.802
Yeah, thought it
was getting better.

38:52.872 --> 38:55.807
Uh... that accident caused
the trauma to the knee.

38:55.908 --> 38:57.000
That's arthritis.

38:57.076 --> 38:58.703
Arthritis doesn't get better.

38:58.778 --> 39:00.939
Gets worse.

39:01.013 --> 39:03.311
Here...

39:03.382 --> 39:04.781
Eat these...
You'll feel better.

39:06.686 --> 39:07.880
Thanks.

39:07.954 --> 39:09.785
Didn't know pharmacists
made house calls.

39:09.855 --> 39:10.822
How much do I owe you?

39:10.890 --> 39:11.822
Nada.
They're samples.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.984
Well, if you're really
getting a guarantee,

39:14.060 --> 39:15.618
then it should be in writing.

39:15.695 --> 39:17.890
Okay, shyster,
who do you like?

39:17.964 --> 39:18.988
The plaintiff.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.362
It's a lock.

39:20.433 --> 39:21.923
I'll take your defendant.

39:22.001 --> 39:24.629
You weren't even here
for the stories.

39:24.704 --> 39:26.638
Yeah, but I know my lawyer.

39:26.706 --> 39:27.798
Turn it up.

39:27.873 --> 39:30.569
...he'd either have
to be foolhardy

39:30.643 --> 39:34.807
or stupid to say, "I'm going to
guarantee you a healthy bird."

39:34.880 --> 39:37.371
Judgment is for the defendant.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.386
You know, you're my only
consistent source of income.

39:42.455 --> 39:46.858
I don't know why
I even come in here.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.518
To be among friends?

39:48.594 --> 39:49.754
That must be it.

39:49.829 --> 39:52.923
All you people ought
to treat me better.

39:55.501 --> 39:57.969
When I'm gone,
you'll discover how hard it is

39:58.037 --> 40:01.473
to find a one-legged lawyer
who's always in a good mood.

40:04.510 --> 40:06.444
Well...

40:08.080 --> 40:11.481
Vaya con huevos, amigos.

40:15.521 --> 40:17.045
"Go with eggs"?

40:31.837 --> 40:32.963
Peter!

40:33.039 --> 40:34.506
Oh, hi.

40:34.573 --> 40:37.770
What's going on?

40:37.843 --> 40:39.111
I don't know.

40:39.111 --> 40:40.840
Where do you
want to start?

40:40.913 --> 40:44.508
Wife and I had a major
shoot-out last night.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.676
She left... took
Wacker with her.

40:46.752 --> 40:47.776
So where's Will?

40:47.853 --> 40:51.084
He's staying with me.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.025
Anyway, I ought to be going.

40:53.025 --> 40:54.822
Hey, you busy right now?

40:54.894 --> 40:56.452
Me?

40:56.529 --> 40:58.827
Uh... well...

40:58.898 --> 41:00.889
fact of the matter is,
Mom has a headache,

41:00.966 --> 41:03.161
and I promised her
I'd get her some aspirin.

41:03.402 --> 41:05.768
Just the guy
I'm looking for. Come on.

41:05.838 --> 41:06.827
Yeah, but I...

41:06.906 --> 41:08.373
Come on.

41:08.441 --> 41:09.931
Haven't got all night.

41:12.545 --> 41:14.035
You want some buns?

41:14.113 --> 41:15.740
Dogs don't eat buns.

41:15.815 --> 41:17.817
Buying ground beef
for your dog?

41:17.817 --> 41:19.785
I don't have a dog.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.534
Don't seem to care
about that too much.

41:38.871 --> 41:41.066
Anyway...

41:41.140 --> 41:43.802
You know, she's been
threatening to leave for months.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.070
Thing is...

41:45.144 --> 41:48.409
I never should've made her
come up for Thanksgiving,

41:48.481 --> 41:50.847
'cause Mom is the one person
in this world

41:50.916 --> 41:52.543
she dislikes more than me.

41:53.886 --> 41:55.080
Jesus Christ, man!

41:55.154 --> 41:56.678
Yeah, that's okay.

41:58.190 --> 41:59.122
Here, hold this.

41:59.191 --> 42:00.419
God.

42:02.628 --> 42:04.528
What's that?

42:06.632 --> 42:07.564
One...

42:07.633 --> 42:08.691
What's going on?

42:10.136 --> 42:11.467
Two...

42:11.537 --> 42:12.731
Think it's enough?

42:12.805 --> 42:13.829
What are you doing, Dad?

42:13.906 --> 42:15.567
I think you're right.

42:15.641 --> 42:16.665
I think we need one more.

42:16.776 --> 42:17.708
Dad.

42:17.777 --> 42:18.709
Oh, yeah.

42:19.779 --> 42:21.041
Hey, Bowzer.

42:21.113 --> 42:23.138
Look at that.

42:23.215 --> 42:24.477
Come on.

42:24.583 --> 42:26.141
Room service.

42:26.218 --> 42:28.049
Yeah... yeah, yeah. Come on.

42:28.120 --> 42:30.645
There you go.

42:30.723 --> 42:31.985
Oh, God.

42:32.057 --> 42:34.116
I don't believe this.

42:34.193 --> 42:35.990
I'm a member of Greenpeace,

42:36.061 --> 42:38.052
and I just helped
poison a dog.

42:38.130 --> 42:39.927
Well, for one thing,
it ain't poison.

42:39.999 --> 42:41.660
For another, you
didn't help much.

42:41.767 --> 42:42.699
That part comes later.

42:42.768 --> 42:43.700
You had any supper?

42:43.769 --> 42:44.895
No.

42:44.970 --> 42:46.904
Well, come on. I'll
buy you a hamburger.

42:50.976 --> 42:52.637
Hey, if it's not
too much trouble,

42:52.711 --> 42:55.077
would you mind telling me
what the hell is going on?

42:55.181 --> 42:56.443
Uh, later, maybe.

43:13.466 --> 43:15.127
I'm not sure this is
a good idea.

43:15.201 --> 43:16.600
Don't worry about it.

43:22.541 --> 43:24.736
Uh... I don't know.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.744
He could be
waiting to pounce.

43:26.812 --> 43:28.871
Nah, he's all pounced out.

43:28.948 --> 43:32.042
Well, maybe it's a trick.

43:32.117 --> 43:34.642
Ain't the smartest dog
in the world, you know.

43:34.720 --> 43:35.948
Yeah, just the meanest.

43:36.021 --> 43:37.045
Watch.

43:42.761 --> 43:43.887
See?

43:46.932 --> 43:48.900
Looks like a good
place. Come on.

43:48.968 --> 43:53.735
Tell me again this is your own
snowblower we're stealing.

43:53.806 --> 43:56.172
I knew your mother was gonna
raise you like this. Get going.

43:56.242 --> 43:58.437
Well, what if somebody
comes by and sees me up...

43:58.511 --> 43:59.739
Hey, hey, hey,
climb, will you?

43:59.812 --> 44:00.836
I'm not getting
any younger.

44:00.913 --> 44:01.880
All right.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.047
Don't get stuck.

44:12.124 --> 44:14.183
Don't get stuck? That's it?

44:14.426 --> 44:17.395
My father walks out on his
family when I'm a year old

44:17.463 --> 44:19.090
and all my life
I've been waiting

44:19.164 --> 44:21.496
for him to show up
and act like a father.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.900
So here I am, finally
with my dad, together at last...

44:25.971 --> 44:27.439
Quality time... right?

44:27.439 --> 44:28.770
And what are we doing?

44:28.841 --> 44:30.638
Breaking and entering.

44:30.709 --> 44:32.074
And what are
his words of wisdom?

44:32.144 --> 44:34.942
"Don't get stuck."

44:38.584 --> 44:39.516
Ooh.

44:39.585 --> 44:40.517
You okay?

44:40.586 --> 44:41.644
Yeah.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.517
All right, here.

44:43.589 --> 44:45.113
Watch it.

44:48.027 --> 44:49.551
Try not to cut your arm off.

44:58.470 --> 44:59.437
Dad?

45:01.974 --> 45:03.373
Don't move.

45:21.961 --> 45:23.588
You were right.

45:23.662 --> 45:24.856
That third pill was the winner.

45:27.232 --> 45:30.759
Wow. I mean, wow,
that was...

45:30.836 --> 45:33.771
You know, when I... when I saw
that dog, I thought...

45:36.442 --> 45:39.002
I've never done anything
like that before.

45:40.980 --> 45:43.210
You know what
Mom's worst fear is?

45:43.449 --> 45:46.646
That your life has been fun.

45:46.719 --> 45:49.517
Tell her not to worry.

45:49.588 --> 45:52.819
I want to show you something.

45:52.891 --> 45:56.088
Hey, we're not going to break
into this place, too, are we?

45:56.161 --> 45:59.187
Nah... I got the
key to this one.

45:59.264 --> 46:01.892
Or I used to.

46:01.967 --> 46:03.127
You own this place?

46:03.202 --> 46:06.000
City probably owns most
of it now in back taxes.

46:06.071 --> 46:07.834
I grew up here.

46:07.906 --> 46:10.739
It was my father's house.

46:10.809 --> 46:14.176
As far as I'm concerned,
it can rot.

46:14.413 --> 46:17.746
He was some piece of work...
your grandfather.

46:17.816 --> 46:18.874
That good, huh?

46:18.951 --> 46:20.919
Yeah, he was...
he was good,

46:20.986 --> 46:22.954
when he was sober, but then,

46:23.022 --> 46:25.081
I don't think
anybody ever saw him sober.

46:27.259 --> 46:30.057
Your grandmother took
the worst of it.

46:30.129 --> 46:33.530
She was just a...

46:33.599 --> 46:35.931
tiny, little woman, and...

46:36.001 --> 46:40.665
my God, he could make her fly.

46:40.739 --> 46:43.936
One minute, she'd be standing...
over there,

46:44.009 --> 46:46.443
and the next minute, she'd be...

46:49.181 --> 46:50.978
...on the opposite side
of the room,

46:51.050 --> 46:53.985
just sitting on the floor.

46:54.053 --> 46:57.250
I made the mistake once of
trying to get in between them.

46:57.489 --> 47:00.925
I don't know... I was 12
or something, and... and, um...

47:00.993 --> 47:02.051
he didn't much care for that.

47:02.127 --> 47:03.651
He...

47:03.729 --> 47:07.460
I had thought he
was going to kill me.

47:07.533 --> 47:09.899
Jesus Christ.

47:11.804 --> 47:14.568
Well, anyway,
fuck him eternally.

47:19.545 --> 47:21.672
I suppose you're going to be
saying the same thing about me

47:21.747 --> 47:23.682
when I'm gone.

47:23.682 --> 47:26.776
You were gone, Dad.

47:26.852 --> 47:28.717
I already said it.

47:35.794 --> 47:39.230
Well, you sure did get over
that fence pretty good

47:39.465 --> 47:41.660
for a college professor.

47:41.734 --> 47:43.531
Yeah, well...

47:43.602 --> 47:46.230
I'm not a college professor
anymore.

47:46.472 --> 47:49.236
I was, uh...

47:49.475 --> 47:51.033
I got fired.

47:51.110 --> 47:53.670
It's no big deal.

47:53.746 --> 47:55.976
University cut back
the English Department.

48:00.686 --> 48:02.153
Trouble is,
it's just hard as hell

48:02.221 --> 48:04.451
getting a job teaching
these days, you know?

48:04.523 --> 48:05.649
I've been looking, and...

48:05.724 --> 48:09.717
schools aren't hiring
right now.

48:09.795 --> 48:12.457
Anyway, I didn't mean
to go on about it.

48:12.531 --> 48:15.864
I'll figure something out.

48:15.934 --> 48:17.629
I don't suppose
you'd be interested

48:17.703 --> 48:20.001
in coming to work for me?

48:22.674 --> 48:23.641
Ah, yeah,

48:23.709 --> 48:24.641
that'd be dumb.

48:24.710 --> 48:25.972
I couldn't pay
you very much.

48:26.044 --> 48:28.604
Minimum wage?

48:28.680 --> 48:30.477
Well, I could do better
than that.

48:30.549 --> 48:31.777
That's fine.

48:31.850 --> 48:34.751
Sure, yeah, that-that,
that's fine.

48:37.122 --> 48:38.646
Sure you know how to do
this kind of work?

48:38.724 --> 48:43.024
How do you think I put myself
through college?

48:46.999 --> 48:48.057
Peter?

48:48.133 --> 48:49.532
Hi, Pop.

48:49.601 --> 48:50.932
Is that your dad with you?

48:51.003 --> 48:52.470
Hey, Ralph.

48:52.538 --> 48:53.800
What's that?

48:53.872 --> 48:55.931
That's a brand-new
snowblower.

48:56.008 --> 48:57.942
Thought you might
be able to use it.

48:58.010 --> 48:59.773
I don't know, Sully.

48:59.845 --> 49:02.075
I can't afford
something like that.

49:02.147 --> 49:04.138
I don't see why not...
didn't cost me anything.

49:04.216 --> 49:05.444
Yeah, that's true.

49:05.517 --> 49:06.882
Just as long as I can
come back and borrow it

49:06.952 --> 49:07.941
every once in a while...

49:08.020 --> 49:09.749
especially if it
keeps on like this.

49:09.822 --> 49:10.754
No problem.

49:10.823 --> 49:11.790
Yeah, Pop,

49:11.857 --> 49:12.789
I think the best thing

49:12.858 --> 49:14.485
would be to keep it
in the garage.

49:14.560 --> 49:15.492
Under a tarp.

49:15.561 --> 49:17.188
Right.

49:17.262 --> 49:20.493
Sure thing.

49:20.566 --> 49:23.797
This is really
awfully good of you, Sully.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.670
Don't mention it.

49:28.740 --> 49:30.935
I'll leave the door open
for you, Peter.

49:31.009 --> 49:33.102
Thanks, Pop.

49:38.283 --> 49:42.686
Oh, damn,
I forgot the aspirin for Mom.

49:42.754 --> 49:44.688
Well...

49:44.756 --> 49:46.592
why don't you give
her one of these?

49:46.592 --> 49:48.560
Oh, I don't know, that's...

49:48.627 --> 49:50.219
Don't worry.

49:50.295 --> 49:51.557
She'll thank you for it.

49:55.500 --> 49:58.492
Listen, tonight was
pretty, uh...

49:58.570 --> 50:01.471
Yeah.

50:21.827 --> 50:23.886
Can I borrow a dollar?

50:23.962 --> 50:25.293
Nope.

50:25.530 --> 50:26.895
You can borrow
a jelly donut, though.

50:26.965 --> 50:29.900
You can't borrow a jelly donut.

50:29.968 --> 50:31.162
Once you eat it, it's gone.

50:31.236 --> 50:33.101
Once you borrow a dollar,
it's gone.

50:33.171 --> 50:34.900
I'd rather buy you
a jelly donut.

50:34.973 --> 50:36.031
Morning, Dad.

50:36.108 --> 50:38.508
Hey, bro, how you doing?
Morning, Cass.

50:38.577 --> 50:39.544
Hey, you wouldn't have

50:39.611 --> 50:41.545
another one of those for Will,
would you?

50:41.613 --> 50:44.104
Sorry, Peter...
that's the last one.

50:44.182 --> 50:45.911
Huh. You don't mind,
do you, Sancho?

50:45.984 --> 50:47.212
Hey, did you see...?

50:47.286 --> 50:49.220
It's okay. You bringing
the kid to work today?

50:49.288 --> 50:51.916
Yeah. Mom had to take
Ralph to the doctor.

50:51.990 --> 50:53.651
Don't worry.
He won't be any trouble.

50:53.725 --> 50:54.993
Not the point.

50:54.993 --> 50:56.221
Dumb... what if he gets hurt?

50:56.295 --> 50:57.626
How?

50:57.696 --> 50:58.628
He could fall in a ditch.

50:58.697 --> 50:59.823
He could run into a nail.
I don't know.

51:02.534 --> 51:04.263
What's so funny?

51:04.503 --> 51:05.902
Nothing.

51:07.306 --> 51:10.207
You mean, I worry about him,
and I never worried about you?

51:10.275 --> 51:12.709
Well, you skipped a generation,
didn't you?

51:16.648 --> 51:19.082
Okay.

51:19.151 --> 51:21.278
Why don't you guys
get going?

51:21.520 --> 51:24.148
I got some stuff to do in town.

51:24.222 --> 51:26.281
I could take Will with me.

51:26.525 --> 51:28.015
That okay with you?

51:28.093 --> 51:28.957
You stay with
your granddad?

51:29.027 --> 51:32.155
All right. Great.

51:32.230 --> 51:34.095
Come on, Sancho,
let's go to work.

51:39.237 --> 51:41.034
How come I got to
go to work with him?

51:42.607 --> 51:43.574
'Cause I say so.

51:43.642 --> 51:45.633
Well, why are you
so nice to him?

51:45.711 --> 51:48.202
He doesn't even like you.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.577
I know...

51:50.882 --> 51:52.816
but I'm growing on him.

51:53.885 --> 51:55.318
Come on, hot shot.

52:05.097 --> 52:07.156
You want to drive?

52:09.801 --> 52:13.897
Come on over... come on,
scoot over.

52:13.972 --> 52:16.304
There you go.

52:16.541 --> 52:19.169
Just be careful
of my bum leg, okay?

52:19.244 --> 52:20.302
Ah...

52:20.545 --> 52:21.705
There you go.

52:21.780 --> 52:23.714
Put your hands on the wheel
right up here.

52:23.782 --> 52:24.874
There you go.

52:24.950 --> 52:26.042
Got it? Huh?

52:26.118 --> 52:27.176
Yeah.

52:27.252 --> 52:28.219
All right.

52:29.821 --> 52:31.618
See how it goes there?

52:33.291 --> 52:37.625
Okay, you're
on your own, kid.

52:37.729 --> 52:39.822
Ooh, there, whoa...

52:39.898 --> 52:40.830
ho-ho-ho.

52:40.899 --> 52:42.526
There you go.
Back... there you go.

52:42.601 --> 52:43.568
There you go.

52:43.635 --> 52:44.567
It's jiggling.

52:44.636 --> 52:47.161
No, it's not jiggling...
it's wobbling.

52:47.239 --> 52:49.139
That's what old trucks do,

52:49.207 --> 52:50.902
they wobble.

52:50.976 --> 52:55.003
I like it.
It's a nice truck.

52:55.080 --> 52:56.138
Yeah, it is.

52:56.214 --> 52:59.547
It is kind of a nice truck,
isn't it?

53:10.662 --> 53:12.289
An invoice...

53:12.531 --> 53:14.965
from how long ago?

53:15.033 --> 53:17.695
No, there's no sign of it, Leon.
Mm-mmm.

53:17.769 --> 53:18.793
Sorry.

53:18.870 --> 53:22.704
I'll keep looking...

53:22.774 --> 53:24.833
but no promises, okay?

53:24.910 --> 53:25.842
Okay. Bye.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.811
So, what's going on?

53:27.879 --> 53:29.039
Where's Ruby?

53:29.114 --> 53:31.207
Alas, Ruby is no more.

53:31.283 --> 53:34.548
She left behind a few tokens
of her affection.

53:34.619 --> 53:36.143
Want a souvenir?

53:36.221 --> 53:39.952
No, I don't think so.

53:40.025 --> 53:41.219
So, where's Dummy?

53:41.293 --> 53:42.920
He's out at the annex.

53:42.994 --> 53:45.224
He says that he's turned over
a new leaf.

53:45.297 --> 53:48.664
He says that
he's a changed man.

53:48.733 --> 53:50.792
No kidding.

53:52.337 --> 53:53.269
Who's this?

53:53.338 --> 53:54.270
Mmm?

53:54.339 --> 53:55.829
That's Will. He's, um...

53:57.008 --> 53:58.999
Hmm?

53:59.077 --> 54:01.511
Well, he's my... um...

54:01.580 --> 54:02.512
he's just kind of shy,

54:02.581 --> 54:05.550
you know, so I don't...

54:05.684 --> 54:07.845
Annex, huh?

54:07.919 --> 54:08.908
Yeah.

54:13.291 --> 54:14.781
You know, when Ruby was here,

54:14.860 --> 54:16.794
she used to wear
a see-through blouse,

54:16.862 --> 54:19.990
so if you just want
to keep up with it...

54:25.137 --> 54:26.229
Okay.

54:26.304 --> 54:28.636
What's the matter,
Grandpa?

54:28.740 --> 54:30.332
What's the matter, Grandpa?

54:34.813 --> 54:36.178
I'll see you.

54:42.154 --> 54:43.951
Say hello to Will here.

54:44.022 --> 54:45.546
Hey, Will.

54:53.899 --> 54:56.094
The only thing I have
is from 1992,

54:56.168 --> 54:58.193
and it says right on this...
"Not an..."

54:58.270 --> 54:59.760
It says, "Not an invoice,"

54:59.838 --> 55:01.772
and I'm not going to pay it,
all right?

55:01.840 --> 55:03.137
What?

55:03.208 --> 55:06.143
You get it figured out
and get back to me, all right?

55:06.211 --> 55:09.180
Hey, Don Sullivan...
thief of snowblowers,

55:09.281 --> 55:12.876
poisoner of dogs, secret father
and grandfather.

55:12.951 --> 55:14.213
How they hanging?

55:14.286 --> 55:15.583
By a thread, as usual.

55:16.821 --> 55:18.083
Want to sit over here?

55:18.156 --> 55:19.953
Just don't mess things up.

55:21.026 --> 55:23.290
Your grandpa tell you

55:23.361 --> 55:24.885
how he steals people's
snowblowers?

55:24.963 --> 55:27.022
You ought to feel sorry
for a guy like that.

55:27.098 --> 55:29.328
You know, he can't keep track
of his toy.

55:34.172 --> 55:36.663
That's funny how
that dog hates you.

55:38.977 --> 55:40.035
That's pitiful, isn't it?

55:40.111 --> 55:43.205
Perfectly good Doberman,
mean as hell...

55:43.281 --> 55:44.771
ruined.

55:44.849 --> 55:46.544
You seem full of piss
and vinegar today.

55:49.287 --> 55:50.652
I was talking to Toby.

55:50.722 --> 55:52.553
She said you were turning over
a new leaf.

55:52.624 --> 55:54.859
You spoke to Toby?

55:54.859 --> 55:56.156
Yeah.

55:56.228 --> 55:57.786
I didn't have the heart
to remind her

55:57.896 --> 55:58.954
who she was talking about.

55:59.030 --> 56:01.931
You... you talked to my wife?

56:03.969 --> 56:05.698
Well, forget about it.

56:05.770 --> 56:09.171
She's probably just telling
people she likes.

56:13.645 --> 56:16.512
Don't tell me she's pregnant.

56:16.581 --> 56:18.572
Knocked up like a cheerleader.

56:22.187 --> 56:24.883
Eh, I suppose now you're going
to want to be godfather.

56:24.956 --> 56:28.756
Hey... I can't be the father
and the godfather.

56:28.827 --> 56:30.294
You got to goddamn
do something.

56:30.362 --> 56:32.523
Great white hunter make baby.

56:32.597 --> 56:33.962
Hah!

56:35.033 --> 56:36.762
Well, big guy,

56:36.835 --> 56:38.132
down to some business, here.

56:38.203 --> 56:39.966
I understand you got
this Victorian

56:40.038 --> 56:41.906
- that you're going to remodel.
- No way.

56:41.906 --> 56:43.168
It'll give us six months work...

56:43.241 --> 56:44.731
- most of it indoors.
- Forget about it.

56:44.809 --> 56:46.606
I got my son to worry about now.

56:46.678 --> 56:48.168
Don't even waste your breath,
Sully.

56:48.246 --> 56:50.180
Victorian house
is a big job.

56:50.248 --> 56:51.647
I need guys with two good knees

56:51.783 --> 56:53.652
and at least a half a brain
between them.

56:53.652 --> 56:55.643
Guy with half a brain
wouldn't work for you.

56:57.722 --> 56:58.984
Drop it.

56:59.057 --> 57:02.026
I should've known better than to
bring it up to someone like you.

57:02.093 --> 57:03.583
Come on, hotshot.

57:03.662 --> 57:05.789
That rattrap of yours
still standing over on Bowdin?

57:05.864 --> 57:07.798
Why?

57:07.866 --> 57:08.855
Come on.

57:08.933 --> 57:11.163
Let's go take a look at it.

57:11.236 --> 57:13.602
I got an idea I want
to talk to you about.

57:16.007 --> 57:18.532
Breaks your heart,
doesn't it?

57:18.610 --> 57:20.945
You know who he reminds me of?

57:20.945 --> 57:22.207
You.

57:22.280 --> 57:25.078
Yeah, he is pretty well hung
at that.

57:36.661 --> 57:39.095
Stay down here for a second,
will you, Will?

57:41.032 --> 57:42.966
Watch your step, Grandpop.

57:55.246 --> 57:56.372
Hey, hey, Sully.

57:56.681 --> 57:58.706
Hey, Sully, wait a minute.

57:58.783 --> 58:00.216
Why don't you just break
one of the windowpanes

58:00.285 --> 58:01.684
and reach inside
and unlock the door.

58:01.753 --> 58:03.880
I know what I'm doing, okay?

58:13.365 --> 58:14.889
Don't say a word.

58:17.001 --> 58:18.628
Excuse me.

58:39.290 --> 58:41.281
I don't know.

58:42.360 --> 58:44.225
I don't know.

58:44.295 --> 58:47.093
I may owe Rub an apology.

58:47.165 --> 58:50.794
He may not be
the dumbest man in Bath.

58:55.407 --> 58:58.240
Goddamn, Sully,
you could've saved this place.

58:58.309 --> 59:01.642
Could've fixed it up
a little bit, rented it out.

59:01.713 --> 59:05.149
Hell, you could've sold it... put
the money in your own pocket.

59:07.218 --> 59:10.153
But you just let it rot.

59:10.221 --> 59:13.679
Just so you could stick it
to your old man, huh?

59:14.759 --> 59:17.023
What's he been dead,
30, 35 years?

59:17.095 --> 59:20.155
You still keeping score?

59:20.231 --> 59:25.032
Well, here's the good news:
You won.

59:25.103 --> 59:27.799
This could be your crowning
achievement, Sully.

59:31.109 --> 59:34.101
All right,
I'll make you a deal.

59:34.179 --> 59:37.115
You sell me this flooring here,
at a reasonable price,

59:37.115 --> 59:39.310
and I'll let you
and the other two stooges

59:39.384 --> 59:40.976
work on the Victorian house.

59:43.054 --> 59:45.249
Sully.

59:45.323 --> 59:48.258
You okay?

59:50.895 --> 59:53.022
Take it.

59:53.097 --> 59:54.394
What?

59:54.632 --> 59:55.826
Take it.
Just...

59:56.901 --> 01:00:00.667
Pull out whatever you want.

01:00:00.738 --> 01:00:03.002
Give the money
to Peter, okay?

01:00:03.074 --> 01:00:05.668
Hey, where's that little kid?

01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:11.638
Will?

01:00:14.719 --> 01:00:17.950
You didn't think
I forgot you, did you?

01:00:18.022 --> 01:00:19.387
Huh?

01:00:19.457 --> 01:00:23.018
Well, I...
I didn't mean to.

01:00:25.663 --> 01:00:27.961
You want to go inside

01:00:28.032 --> 01:00:29.056
and see where I grew up?

01:00:29.133 --> 01:00:30.964
You'd like it.

01:00:33.071 --> 01:00:35.437
Okay, you decide.

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:37.140
You can come inside
with me or...

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:38.971
or you can go back
and see your dad.

01:00:39.043 --> 01:00:40.271
Okay.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.245
Okay, which?

01:00:44.382 --> 01:00:46.907
Go see Dad.

01:00:49.954 --> 01:00:52.946
Sure. Okay. Let's go.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.643
Your dad's right
over there, okay?

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:19.873
Hey.

01:01:24.122 --> 01:01:26.147
It's okay.

01:01:29.127 --> 01:01:30.924
You forgot him?

01:01:30.995 --> 01:01:33.623
Well, it couldn't have been more
than a couple of minutes.

01:01:33.698 --> 01:01:36.098
Yeah, well it probably
seemed like longer to him.

01:01:36.167 --> 01:01:38.135
Probably seemed like...
forever to him.

01:01:38.202 --> 01:01:41.103
You know, you...
God, I should've known.

01:01:41.172 --> 01:01:44.733
You're never going
to change, are you?

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:22.006
I'd like to talk to Will.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.743
I'd like to talk
to my grandson.

01:02:32.423 --> 01:02:34.323
Hey, hotshot.

01:02:36.861 --> 01:02:38.761
Kind of messed up today,
didn't I?

01:02:42.266 --> 01:02:44.894
I mean, you were pretty scared,
weren't you?

01:02:49.974 --> 01:02:51.407
You know what I used to do

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:53.774
when I was your age
and I got scared?

01:02:53.845 --> 01:02:58.214
I'd try to be brave
for exactly a minute,

01:02:58.282 --> 01:03:00.409
and the next time,

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:02.711
I'd try to be brave
for two minutes.

01:03:02.787 --> 01:03:05.950
What were you scared of?

01:03:06.024 --> 01:03:10.893
I don't remember, but, hey...

01:03:10.962 --> 01:03:15.296
when you get to be my age,
you won't remember either.

01:03:15.366 --> 01:03:17.357
Here.

01:03:20.738 --> 01:03:23.138
You can time
yourself with it.

01:03:23.207 --> 01:03:26.233
The big hand'll go around once...
that'll be a minute.

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:29.245
Goes around again...
that'll be two minutes.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:32.180
Then you can tell how long
you've been brave.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:35.185
Here.

01:03:36.921 --> 01:03:39.287
Thank you.

01:03:41.259 --> 01:03:43.284
You're welcome.

01:03:53.738 --> 01:03:55.399
Can I ask you a question?

01:03:57.942 --> 01:03:59.773
Why'd you do it...

01:03:59.844 --> 01:04:00.936
walk out on us?

01:04:01.012 --> 01:04:04.072
Oh... how the hell do I know?

01:04:04.148 --> 01:04:08.016
It was, um...

01:04:08.086 --> 01:04:10.919
a mistake.

01:04:10.988 --> 01:04:13.957
Me and your mother
was just a mistake.

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:17.050
What would you
like me to say?

01:04:17.128 --> 01:04:18.891
I was a rotten father?

01:04:18.963 --> 01:04:23.366
Well, I wasn't around enough
for that, remember?

01:04:23.434 --> 01:04:25.868
Not around.
Not ever.

01:04:25.937 --> 01:04:27.768
Satisfied?

01:04:27.839 --> 01:04:28.863
Well...

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.737
if you're not a father to me,

01:04:30.808 --> 01:04:33.038
how come you're
a grandfather to Will?

01:04:33.111 --> 01:04:37.673
'Cause you got to start
someplace.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:39.405
You alive in there,
old girl?

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.741
Didn't die in your sleep, di...

01:05:55.793 --> 01:05:57.886
Well, what happened?
What did he say?

01:05:57.962 --> 01:06:01.625
If I tell you, will you promise
not to tell my son about it?

01:06:01.766 --> 01:06:03.961
No, I can't do that.

01:06:04.035 --> 01:06:06.401
Well, then, I won't tell you.

01:06:06.704 --> 01:06:07.932
Let's go.

01:06:11.075 --> 01:06:12.440
No, I can do that.

01:06:19.283 --> 01:06:21.183
All right, I won't tell him.

01:06:21.252 --> 01:06:22.776
Now, what happened?

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:25.118
It was a stroke.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:26.451
A what?

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:29.093
A stroke. Just a tiny one.

01:06:29.093 --> 01:06:32.324
It's not uncommon
in people of my age,

01:06:32.396 --> 01:06:35.299
but he gave me medication,
and he said if I'm careful,

01:06:35.299 --> 01:06:38.200
there's no reason I shouldn't
live for a long time.

01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:39.964
I'm calling Clive Jr.
Right now.

01:06:40.037 --> 01:06:41.299
No, no, Donald, you promised.

01:06:41.372 --> 01:06:42.771
He's your son.
He's got a right.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.102
Donald.

01:06:44.175 --> 01:06:47.406
If you tell Clive about this,
he'll put me in a rest home,

01:06:47.478 --> 01:06:49.969
and there'll be nothing
I can do about it.

01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:53.073
You know I'm right
about that.

01:06:54.418 --> 01:06:57.046
And if he did...

01:06:57.121 --> 01:06:59.783
I don't think I could bear it.

01:06:59.857 --> 01:07:02.291
Okay, but, uh...

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.328
you're going to...

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.863
need someone who can
really look after you.

01:07:06.931 --> 01:07:08.330
I have someone to look after me.

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:10.390
No, no, I don't think so.

01:07:10.468 --> 01:07:12.936
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:07:13.004 --> 01:07:17.065
Do you still bet
on that horse race of yours?

01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:18.904
What, the trifecta?

01:07:18.976 --> 01:07:20.204
Yes.
Has it ever come in?

01:07:20.278 --> 01:07:21.870
Not yet.

01:07:21.946 --> 01:07:23.140
But you still bet on it.

01:07:23.214 --> 01:07:24.340
Well, sure, I mean,

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:26.110
the odds have got to kick in
sooner or later.

01:07:26.183 --> 01:07:28.981
Fine... that's exactly the way
I feel about you.

01:07:29.053 --> 01:07:30.179
Now, will you please

01:07:30.254 --> 01:07:32.279
drive me home?

01:07:36.193 --> 01:07:38.787
Thank you, Donald.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:42.161
Wish you hadn't told me
those were rats down there.

01:07:42.233 --> 01:07:44.963
Know what else I wish?

01:07:45.036 --> 01:07:46.435
What?

01:07:46.537 --> 01:07:49.836
I wish some big old company
would moved to town,

01:07:49.907 --> 01:07:52.467
pay us a lot of money.

01:07:52.543 --> 01:07:54.909
We could work indoors.

01:07:54.979 --> 01:07:57.915
No more Carl Roebuck.

01:07:57.915 --> 01:08:01.146
Know what I really wish?

01:08:01.218 --> 01:08:05.056
I really wish Peter'd
quit calling me "Sancho."

01:08:05.056 --> 01:08:06.421
I hate that name.

01:08:06.724 --> 01:08:11.684
Fact is, I wish Peter'd
just flat go away.

01:08:11.762 --> 01:08:12.786
What?

01:08:12.863 --> 01:08:17.162
I said, I wish Peter'd
go on back to his own home.

01:08:17.234 --> 01:08:20.225
I liked it better when
it was just the two of us.

01:08:20.337 --> 01:08:24.671
I hate it the way you talk
to him all the time.

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:32.715
You know, used to be you
and me'd go places together.

01:08:32.783 --> 01:08:34.751
Now he's always there.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.343
He's my son.

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.979
Shh. He's coming.

01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:40.080
Hey, Sancho.

01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:41.145
See what I mean?

01:08:41.225 --> 01:08:42.852
- Any luck?
- Yeah.

01:08:42.926 --> 01:08:43.859
I think I found a place.

01:08:43.928 --> 01:08:45.395
- Hey.
- What place?

01:08:45.462 --> 01:08:47.260
Two bedroom apartment
for me and Will.

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:48.798
It's in a nice neighborhood,

01:08:48.866 --> 01:08:50.493
rent's not too bad.

01:08:50.734 --> 01:08:52.497
You mean, you're...
you're going to stay?

01:08:52.803 --> 01:08:56.170
Yeah. Pretty much
made up my mind.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:00.176
He's going to... stay here,
work with us from now on?

01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:02.178
Looks like it.

01:09:02.246 --> 01:09:03.941
Well, wh...

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:06.676
there's not enough work
for the three of us.

01:09:06.751 --> 01:09:09.049
Why don't you let me
worry about that.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.055
Well, I don't like it.

01:09:12.055 --> 01:09:13.148
You don't
have to like it.

01:09:17.495 --> 01:09:21.022
Hey, Sully, could I have a beer?

01:09:21.131 --> 01:09:22.064
What are you asking me for?

01:09:22.133 --> 01:09:23.760
'Cause you're the boss.

01:09:23.834 --> 01:09:24.765
Ask him.

01:09:24.835 --> 01:09:25.995
He bought the beer.

01:09:26.069 --> 01:09:27.662
Here you go, Sancho.

01:09:41.419 --> 01:09:42.977
Hey, where you going?

01:09:52.095 --> 01:09:54.029
I quit.

01:09:55.966 --> 01:09:57.331
Rub!

01:09:57.401 --> 01:09:59.460
Shit. Oh...

01:09:59.537 --> 01:10:02.005
Come on back here.

01:10:24.361 --> 01:10:27.262
Dad... Dad, you're
driving on the sidewalk.

01:10:27.331 --> 01:10:28.889
Relax.

01:10:28.966 --> 01:10:29.990
Look at that.

01:10:30.067 --> 01:10:32.035
You ever seen anybody
that stubborn?

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:34.071
Yes, I have.

01:10:35.906 --> 01:10:36.930
Can't figure it out.

01:10:37.007 --> 01:10:37.974
All he's got to do

01:10:38.042 --> 01:10:40.237
is duck behind something
and we're screwed.

01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:42.245
Oh, I'd have to say
we're screwed anyhow.

01:10:55.593 --> 01:10:57.220
Sully, you're on the sidewalk!

01:10:58.562 --> 01:11:00.052
Up yours, Raymer.

01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:21.181
That's not a good place to park,

01:11:21.252 --> 01:11:22.480
Raymer.

01:11:22.553 --> 01:11:24.783
Enough!

01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.287
Get out of the truck now, Sully!

01:11:28.359 --> 01:11:30.020
Fun's over...
I'm going to have

01:11:30.094 --> 01:11:31.755
to put you under arrest.

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:36.857
This is where a smart guy
would get out of the truck.

01:11:36.934 --> 01:11:38.492
- Come on, Dad.
- Suit yourself.

01:11:45.109 --> 01:11:46.770
Halt!

01:11:46.877 --> 01:11:48.139
Jesus, Dad!

01:11:48.212 --> 01:11:49.543
He'll never use it.

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:55.181
Did he shoot?

01:11:55.252 --> 01:11:56.879
I believe that
was a gunshot, yes.

01:11:56.954 --> 01:11:59.252
I vote we surrender,
if I have a vote.

01:12:19.109 --> 01:12:22.010
You stupid prick.

01:12:31.956 --> 01:12:33.753
Well?

01:12:33.857 --> 01:12:34.949
Nothing.

01:12:35.025 --> 01:12:36.959
Good.

01:12:37.027 --> 01:12:39.154
For a moment there, I thought
you were going to be critical.

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:42.028
Haven't I been warning you
about something like this?

01:12:42.099 --> 01:12:43.031
Clive...

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.761
Haven't I?
The man's a lunatic.

01:12:44.835 --> 01:12:46.234
I'm sure there's
an explanation.

01:12:46.303 --> 01:12:49.568
What explanation can there be
for attacking a policeman?

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.404
I suppose I should be grateful
he didn't go berserk right here

01:12:52.476 --> 01:12:53.602
in this house.

01:12:53.844 --> 01:12:57.507
I want Donald Sullivan
out of here,

01:12:57.581 --> 01:12:59.947
and I want him out of here now.

01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:06.082
And if you won't do it,

01:13:06.156 --> 01:13:08.147
I will.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:16.896
Hmm... I hate to say it,

01:13:16.967 --> 01:13:20.198
but for once in his life,
The Bank is right.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:23.035
I screwed up.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:26.338
Looks like I'll be spending a...

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:28.571
a little vacation
at the County's expense,

01:13:28.812 --> 01:13:31.076
so you'd better get yourself
another tenant.

01:13:31.148 --> 01:13:33.582
I don't want another tenant.

01:13:33.817 --> 01:13:35.842
I've enjoyed your company.

01:13:35.919 --> 01:13:39.787
Face it, Beryl,
I'm the wrong man for the job.

01:13:39.857 --> 01:13:41.950
Maybe it'll teach us both

01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:44.085
not to bet on long shots.

01:13:56.473 --> 01:13:58.532
What do you think?

01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:05.840
Sure doesn't feel
like Christmas.

01:14:08.452 --> 01:14:10.443
Get Rub to help you
with the floors.

01:14:10.554 --> 01:14:11.748
Don't forget.

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.756
Okay.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.258
You can always get him down
at the diner, you know.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.555
Right.

01:14:18.796 --> 01:14:20.286
You know how to use
a circular saw?

01:14:20.364 --> 01:14:23.162
Better than you.

01:14:23.233 --> 01:14:25.497
I doubt it.

01:14:25.602 --> 01:14:29.003
How long do you think
it'll take you to finish?

01:14:29.073 --> 01:14:30.062
Couple of days.

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:31.767
Hmm. Well, get Rub...

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:33.070
Get Rub to help.

01:14:35.312 --> 01:14:39.112
Did I give you the
keys to the Ford?

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:40.484
About an hour and a half ago.

01:14:40.484 --> 01:14:42.281
Well, if you get
any trouble with it,

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.287
just take it down
to the Texaco station.

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:46.516
There's a guy down there
by the name of Harold.

01:14:46.824 --> 01:14:47.381
He's the owner.

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:49.255
Just tell him you're my son.

01:14:49.326 --> 01:14:52.887
Right. You run into problems,
drop your old man's name.

01:14:52.963 --> 01:14:54.453
Watch the doors fly open.

01:14:54.531 --> 01:14:57.432
Can't believe it's going
to take you that long

01:14:57.501 --> 01:14:58.991
to get me out of jail.

01:14:59.069 --> 01:15:00.468
Don't blame me...
I'm a Jew.

01:15:00.771 --> 01:15:02.261
These aren't my holidays.

01:15:02.339 --> 01:15:03.772
A Jew... really?

01:15:05.809 --> 01:15:08.209
I didn't know that.

01:15:08.278 --> 01:15:10.371
How come you ain't smart?

01:15:13.016 --> 01:15:16.452
How can I start getting
you out of jail

01:15:16.587 --> 01:15:18.555
when you won't go in?

01:15:18.789 --> 01:15:19.983
Got a point.

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:32.928
A condemned man gets
a last wish, right?

01:15:35.005 --> 01:15:36.370
I got my truck out back.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.965
How 'bout you and me go out
there and get ourselves naked

01:15:39.042 --> 01:15:40.339
and then just
see what happens?

01:15:43.046 --> 01:15:44.240
Okay.

01:15:44.314 --> 01:15:46.544
Haven't you got any pride?

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:48.174
Go to jail, Sully.

01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:50.117
It's where you belong.

01:15:50.187 --> 01:15:52.155
Look, your kid's asleep.

01:15:55.359 --> 01:15:59.989
I haven't seen him like this
since he was six months old.

01:16:05.335 --> 01:16:07.235
Touching, isn't it?

01:16:07.304 --> 01:16:09.169
Breaks your heart.

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:11.468
Wake up.

01:16:11.608 --> 01:16:13.132
Oh, God...

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:14.871
let's get out of here.

01:16:18.182 --> 01:16:21.515
- Get the check, will you?
- I'll pay your check.

01:16:23.153 --> 01:16:25.522
You okay?

01:16:25.522 --> 01:16:27.046
Yeah.

01:16:27.124 --> 01:16:29.991
Wirf will have you out
of there in a couple of days.

01:16:32.196 --> 01:16:35.222
Ralph's been a good father
to you, you know?

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:38.359
Yes, he has.

01:16:38.435 --> 01:16:40.369
You turned out all right.

01:16:40.437 --> 01:16:44.032
So did you.

01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:46.837
Want to hear something funny?

01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:49.902
I never told anybody
this before.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.607
After I got out of the Army,

01:16:51.849 --> 01:16:54.249
I went to college
for about six months.

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:56.252
I really liked it.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.185
Why did you quit?

01:16:58.255 --> 01:17:00.780
I said I liked it...
I didn't say I belonged there.

01:17:00.858 --> 01:17:03.258
Well, where do you belong, Dad?

01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:07.486
Right there.

01:17:10.267 --> 01:17:12.462
For tonight, anyway.

01:17:12.569 --> 01:17:15.766
Want me to go
in there with you?

01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:17.033
Nope.

01:17:17.107 --> 01:17:18.369
Good.

01:17:27.985 --> 01:17:30.283
Well, I'll be out
before you know it.

01:17:35.425 --> 01:17:36.551
Hey!

01:17:38.095 --> 01:17:40.256
Look after Wirf, will you?

01:17:41.899 --> 01:17:43.196
And Miss Beryl?

01:17:43.267 --> 01:17:45.098
Right.

01:17:49.907 --> 01:17:51.238
Oh...

01:17:54.144 --> 01:17:56.908
Take care of Rub's jelly donuts.

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.414
It's not going to be easy
being you, is it?

01:17:59.483 --> 01:18:00.916
Don't expect too much

01:18:00.984 --> 01:18:02.383
of yourself
at the beginning.

01:18:02.486 --> 01:18:05.512
I couldn't do everything
at first, either.

01:18:35.886 --> 01:18:37.444
But you gave me your word.

01:18:37.521 --> 01:18:39.113
People here
are counting on you.

01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:40.884
I'm counting on you.

01:18:40.958 --> 01:18:43.927
Mr. Peoples, did we sign
any papers?

01:18:43.994 --> 01:18:46.019
Now, listen, this is nothing
personal.

01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:48.530
I know how much you good people
wanted this thing to happen,

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:51.397
but it's flat out
not going to work.

01:18:51.468 --> 01:18:52.833
Why?

01:18:52.903 --> 01:18:54.871
Well, the fact is
we crunched the numbers,

01:18:54.938 --> 01:18:55.996
and they didn't add up.

01:18:56.073 --> 01:18:57.540
But you don't understand.

01:18:57.608 --> 01:18:59.439
These people bought
a thousand acres

01:18:59.509 --> 01:19:01.443
of depressed real estate
because of you.

01:19:01.511 --> 01:19:03.376
Oh, you got that wrong, Clive.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:05.847
Those people bought that land
because of you.

01:19:05.916 --> 01:19:08.180
You promised that this
was a sure thing.

01:19:08.251 --> 01:19:11.015
Well, we were a teeny bit wrong
about that, wasn't we?

01:19:11.088 --> 01:19:12.282
But...

01:19:12.356 --> 01:19:14.517
It's been good talking to you.
Nighty-night.

01:19:18.328 --> 01:19:20.296
Merry Christmas, Mr. Peoples.

01:19:22.966 --> 01:19:25.127
Merry Christmas.

01:20:29.633 --> 01:20:30.600
Thanks, Ollie.

01:20:30.667 --> 01:20:32.225
God, I love small towns.

01:20:32.335 --> 01:20:33.359
Where else in the world

01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:35.166
would they let a guy
out of jail for three hours

01:20:35.238 --> 01:20:36.466
just to serve as a pall bearer?

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.541
Yeah.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:38.542
Been arraigned yet?

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:40.100
No... this afternoon.

01:20:40.177 --> 01:20:41.371
How you going to plead?

01:20:41.445 --> 01:20:43.140
Temporary insanity.

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:45.408
We're going to say that
those pills you gave me

01:20:45.482 --> 01:20:46.608
made me absolutely nuts.

01:20:54.624 --> 01:20:56.114
All right, girls, we're on.

01:20:59.963 --> 01:21:01.396
All right, here we go.

01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:03.660
One, two, three.

01:21:06.136 --> 01:21:08.161
Well, you must
be feeling great.

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:11.264
Well, why should I be feeling
great... I'm in jail.

01:21:11.341 --> 01:21:12.467
Truck's falling apart...

01:21:12.542 --> 01:21:13.668
I haven't got
40 bucks to my name.

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:14.968
Yeah, but the trifecta

01:21:15.045 --> 01:21:17.605
you've been betting
for ten years finally hit.

01:21:17.914 --> 01:21:19.074
Hey, be careful!

01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:20.081
My trifecta?

01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:21.117
Yeah.

01:21:21.184 --> 01:21:22.879
You mean, the one I've been
betting every day?

01:21:22.953 --> 01:21:25.319
It hit two days ago.

01:21:25.388 --> 01:21:27.958
Well, I was in jail.
I didn't bet it.

01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:29.619
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

01:21:31.194 --> 01:21:32.491
Now do you believe in luck?

01:21:32.562 --> 01:21:34.621
Luck had nothing to do
with you being in jail.

01:21:34.731 --> 01:21:36.631
Did you hear about Clive Jr.?

01:21:36.733 --> 01:21:37.893
No, what?

01:21:37.968 --> 01:21:38.935
He skipped town.

01:21:40.003 --> 01:21:40.935
- Hey!
- Oh, ho...

01:21:41.004 --> 01:21:43.199
Mr. Sullivan,
have a little respect.

01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:44.205
What?

01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:46.139
The money
for the theme park folded.

01:21:46.209 --> 01:21:49.508
Bank's stuck with all
that worthless land.

01:21:49.579 --> 01:21:51.945
So he disappeared.

01:21:52.015 --> 01:21:54.040
Well, what about Miss Beryl?

01:21:54.117 --> 01:21:56.017
Not great.

01:21:56.086 --> 01:21:57.553
Boy...

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:59.213
Guy goes to jail
for a couple of days...

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:01.120
the whole town goes to hell.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.592
Sully?

01:22:04.661 --> 01:22:05.650
Yeah, Ralph?

01:22:05.896 --> 01:22:08.330
Listen, remember that
snowblower you gave me?

01:22:08.398 --> 01:22:09.365
Yeah?

01:22:09.432 --> 01:22:11.957
Well, somebody stole it
last night...

01:22:12.035 --> 01:22:13.900
right out of the garage.

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:18.202
I... I covered it with a tarp
just the way you told me...

01:22:18.275 --> 01:22:19.936
Don't worry about it.

01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:22.342
I know exactly
where to find it.

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.514
Never in a million years.

01:22:42.599 --> 01:22:45.500
Well... here we are again,
Mr. Sullivan.

01:22:45.569 --> 01:22:47.366
How's your knee?

01:22:47.437 --> 01:22:48.404
Rotten.

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.072
Your Honor.

01:22:51.141 --> 01:22:52.165
Well, it doesn't seem

01:22:52.242 --> 01:22:53.334
to slow you down much.

01:22:53.410 --> 01:22:56.470
Doesn't keep you from punching
out policemen or anything.

01:22:56.546 --> 01:22:57.478
Your Honor...

01:22:57.547 --> 01:22:58.639
Mr. Wirfley, don't.

01:22:58.715 --> 01:23:00.876
There are times
when less is more,

01:23:00.951 --> 01:23:02.043
and this is one of them.

01:23:02.118 --> 01:23:03.142
Now, then...

01:23:03.253 --> 01:23:04.550
How are you doing,
Wyatt Earp?

01:23:04.621 --> 01:23:05.553
Your Honor...

01:23:05.622 --> 01:23:06.554
Same advice:

01:23:06.623 --> 01:23:08.921
"Less is more."

01:23:10.093 --> 01:23:12.323
Tell me,
what do you usually do

01:23:12.395 --> 01:23:13.555
when somebody throws a punch
at you?

01:23:21.238 --> 01:23:22.262
Duck.

01:23:22.339 --> 01:23:24.637
Next time, do that.

01:23:24.741 --> 01:23:28.336
Now, is it true that you
discharged your weapon, Officer?

01:23:28.411 --> 01:23:30.470
Your Honor,
it was a warning shot.

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:32.515
Mm-hmm.
You know who you warned?

01:23:32.582 --> 01:23:34.948
A little old lady sitting
on her commode

01:23:35.018 --> 01:23:36.645
two blocks away.

01:23:36.953 --> 01:23:37.647
Ollie...

01:23:37.954 --> 01:23:40.286
you know my feelings
about arming morons.

01:23:40.357 --> 01:23:42.655
You arm one,
you've got to arm them all,

01:23:42.959 --> 01:23:44.586
otherwise it wouldn't be
good sport.

01:23:44.661 --> 01:23:47.596
Your Honor, Officer Raymer
is currently under suspension.

01:23:47.664 --> 01:23:49.427
Anesthesia is what
he should be under.

01:23:49.499 --> 01:23:50.591
Your Honor!

01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:54.000
I'd just like to say, and
what's this country coming to...

01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:56.698
Raymer, shut the fuck up.

01:24:48.992 --> 01:24:53.395
Boy, I wouldn't sit here
too long.

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:57.627
Tip of your dick'll freeze
to the top of the step.

01:24:57.701 --> 01:24:59.999
Oh, I forgot... yours ain't
that long.

01:25:01.504 --> 01:25:04.166
Yours ain't either.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.640
It's 'cause I fold it.

01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:10.373
Want to know how many times
I fold it?

01:25:10.447 --> 01:25:12.574
It would hurt
if you folded it.

01:25:12.682 --> 01:25:14.274
Not mine.

01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:24.226
Know what I wish?

01:25:24.327 --> 01:25:25.885
No. What do you wish?

01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:31.327
I wish we were still friends.

01:25:33.136 --> 01:25:34.569
We are, Rub.

01:25:37.474 --> 01:25:39.271
You know what I wish?

01:25:39.342 --> 01:25:41.708
I wish we'd get off our asses.

01:25:41.945 --> 01:25:44.004
Let's go down to The Horse
and place some poker.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.707
What do you think?

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:51.483
Wha-what about...

01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:54.285
Peter?

01:25:56.292 --> 01:25:58.590
Hey, look at me.

01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:03.963
Peter's my son...

01:26:07.003 --> 01:26:10.996
and you're my best friend, okay?

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:21.240
Ah...

01:26:21.317 --> 01:26:23.046
you're not going to start
crying, are you?

01:26:27.357 --> 01:26:29.723
I should've stayed in jail.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.305
I can bet 40.

01:26:45.375 --> 01:26:46.776
Oh, boy.

01:26:46.776 --> 01:26:49.279
I'm in.

01:26:49.279 --> 01:26:51.144
I don't want to be
in, but I'm in.

01:26:51.214 --> 01:26:52.203
Okay, sucker.

01:26:52.315 --> 01:26:53.509
I'll see you...

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:54.515
and...

01:26:56.653 --> 01:26:59.281
I'll raise you.

01:26:59.355 --> 01:27:01.653
He's bluffing.

01:27:01.724 --> 01:27:03.954
Goddamn it, Birdy,
close the door.

01:27:04.027 --> 01:27:05.460
I'm sitting here naked.

01:27:05.528 --> 01:27:06.893
Then you should play
better poker.

01:27:06.963 --> 01:27:08.294
Jocko.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.434
He's in.

01:27:12.502 --> 01:27:13.901
Oh, thank you, Birdy.

01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:14.902
Mm-hmm.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.268
Don't show him
your cards, Rub.

01:27:20.343 --> 01:27:21.708
I call.

01:27:24.647 --> 01:27:26.615
Ace-high flush.

01:27:26.683 --> 01:27:29.049
Read 'em and weep, guys.

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.086
Queens full.

01:27:30.153 --> 01:27:31.154
Why not?

01:27:31.154 --> 01:27:33.281
Damn, why shouldn't
this be the night

01:27:33.356 --> 01:27:35.586
I lose every goddamn
hand in the game.

01:27:36.659 --> 01:27:38.650
Goddamn theme park
goes down the tubes...

01:27:38.728 --> 01:27:40.958
I'm stuck with 14 crappy,
half-built houses

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:42.998
I'm never going
to be able to unload...

01:27:43.066 --> 01:27:44.260
and on top of all of it,

01:27:44.334 --> 01:27:46.268
for some reason
Toby has taken exception

01:27:46.336 --> 01:27:47.735
with my new secretary.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:50.132
Whose gun is that?

01:27:50.206 --> 01:27:53.573
It's yours, bonehead.
It was your ante.

01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:55.278
Hell, I should've busted
this game two hours ago.

01:27:55.278 --> 01:27:56.279
All right.

01:27:56.279 --> 01:27:57.678
The game is seven
card stud.

01:27:57.747 --> 01:28:00.011
One-eyed jacks
and suicide kings are wild.

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:01.516
Oh, come on, Jocko.

01:28:01.584 --> 01:28:02.448
What are all
these wild cards?

01:28:02.519 --> 01:28:03.884
Can we just play a
normal game of poker?

01:28:03.953 --> 01:28:06.683
How come she's staring
at me like that?

01:28:06.923 --> 01:28:09.016
Because you're
a good-looking guy, Rub.

01:28:09.092 --> 01:28:10.059
Am not.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.185
Sure, you are.

01:28:12.262 --> 01:28:14.696
Carl, is he
a good-looking guy?

01:28:14.931 --> 01:28:16.057
He is at that.

01:28:16.132 --> 01:28:17.099
Oh.

01:28:19.135 --> 01:28:21.330
Sully, you might want to drop by
the Bowdin Street house

01:28:21.404 --> 01:28:22.336
on the way home.

01:28:22.405 --> 01:28:24.100
- Oh, something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:25.903
I left you a little
something over there.

01:28:25.975 --> 01:28:28.068
Spirit of the season,
so to speak.

01:28:31.948 --> 01:28:33.540
- Jocko.
- Hmm?

01:28:33.616 --> 01:28:35.709
You got any of those
yellow doozies around?

01:28:35.952 --> 01:28:37.044
Why, is your leg worse?

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.052
No.

01:28:38.121 --> 01:28:40.282
They're for Carl.

01:28:40.356 --> 01:28:44.486
Oh, my God.

01:28:47.564 --> 01:28:48.565
Here.

01:28:48.565 --> 01:28:50.533
Two tickets... Hawaii.
You and me.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.067
Toby...

01:28:52.135 --> 01:28:55.195
There's a perfectly logical
explanation for this.

01:28:55.271 --> 01:28:57.432
There is?

01:28:57.507 --> 01:28:58.439
Well?

01:28:58.508 --> 01:28:59.736
Hawaii?

01:28:59.809 --> 01:29:03.006
No bullshit?

01:29:03.079 --> 01:29:04.603
No bullshit.

01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:08.110
Goddamn, Sully,

01:29:08.184 --> 01:29:10.049
when your luck turns...

01:29:10.119 --> 01:29:11.108
it turns.

01:29:11.187 --> 01:29:14.350
Luck has nothing
to do with this.

01:29:14.424 --> 01:29:17.621
I'll have to get
a new bathing suit.

01:29:17.694 --> 01:29:19.127
The place we're going,
you won't need anything.

01:29:19.195 --> 01:29:20.628
I have enough coconut oil
for both of us.

01:29:20.697 --> 01:29:23.723
I do you, and you do me.

01:29:23.967 --> 01:29:25.229
Yeah, that's the general idea.

01:29:25.301 --> 01:29:27.428
Oh, for God's sake, Toby...
you're pregnant.

01:29:27.503 --> 01:29:28.731
You can be the godfather.

01:29:28.972 --> 01:29:29.734
Shut up, Sully!

01:29:29.973 --> 01:29:32.066
Sunny skies.

01:29:32.141 --> 01:29:33.506
Sandy beaches.

01:29:33.576 --> 01:29:36.409
No more snow, no more
broken-down pickup truck.

01:29:36.479 --> 01:29:37.537
Oh, yeah.

01:29:37.647 --> 01:29:39.979
Damn, Carl,
you going to let him

01:29:40.049 --> 01:29:41.573
get away with that?

01:29:41.651 --> 01:29:43.744
Aw, don't worry
about it, Ollie.

01:29:43.987 --> 01:29:45.978
He'll never go
through with it.

01:29:46.055 --> 01:29:47.454
You want to bet?

01:29:47.523 --> 01:29:49.582
Cash me in, guys.

01:29:49.692 --> 01:29:51.284
Oh, I'll bet.

01:29:51.361 --> 01:29:53.591
I'll bet you make it

01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:56.096
about as far as the plane
out of spite.

01:29:56.165 --> 01:29:58.326
But then you know what's going
to happen, Sully?

01:29:58.401 --> 01:29:59.993
Somewhere over Kansas,

01:30:00.069 --> 01:30:02.094
Toby's going to start crying,

01:30:02.171 --> 01:30:03.536
and as your ex-wife
can tell you, Sully,

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.130
you don't handle that shit
very well.

01:30:08.544 --> 01:30:11.012
Rub...

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.446
in about a minute,
that poor son of a bitch

01:30:13.516 --> 01:30:14.540
is going to realize

01:30:14.617 --> 01:30:17.051
he's made the biggest
mistake of his life.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.386
He tries to follow
us, shoot him.

01:30:28.498 --> 01:30:29.522
Sully.

01:30:30.733 --> 01:30:32.758
You got something to say?

01:30:44.213 --> 01:30:45.612
No.

01:30:49.085 --> 01:30:50.245
Fine.

01:31:58.521 --> 01:32:00.148
- Toby...
- No, don't.

01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:02.248
Please, don't.

01:32:02.325 --> 01:32:06.125
I want to thank you
for thinking of me.

01:32:06.195 --> 01:32:08.129
Yeah.

01:32:10.466 --> 01:32:12.491
I, uh...

01:32:12.568 --> 01:32:15.002
You know, until a while ago,

01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:16.129
I could've...

01:32:16.205 --> 01:32:17.763
I could've...

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.070
but...

01:32:21.377 --> 01:32:25.438
I just found out
I'm somebody's grandfather.

01:32:25.515 --> 01:32:30.418
I'm somebody's
father, and...

01:32:30.486 --> 01:32:32.681
and maybe...

01:32:32.789 --> 01:32:34.620
I'm somebody's friend
in the bargain.

01:32:36.426 --> 01:32:38.018
So...

01:32:39.195 --> 01:32:41.663
Yeah...

01:32:41.731 --> 01:32:44.791
you are a man among men.

01:32:44.867 --> 01:32:46.562
I know, it's not a compliment.

01:32:46.636 --> 01:32:48.570
No, this time it is.

01:32:48.638 --> 01:32:52.130
How come you're always
wrong about everything?

01:33:01.784 --> 01:33:03.342
Mmm...

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:15.765
You are...

01:33:15.765 --> 01:33:19.064
the best...

01:33:19.135 --> 01:33:21.330
Iooking woman in Bath,
and...

01:33:21.404 --> 01:33:22.805
you're going to be

01:33:22.805 --> 01:33:25.467
the best-looking
woman in Hawaii.

01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:27.805
You're going to be fine.

01:33:28.044 --> 01:33:31.036
Thanks.

01:33:45.528 --> 01:33:50.056
We would've been
terrific together.

01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:54.493
Yeah, I think so.

01:34:33.576 --> 01:34:36.101
Don't tell me they actually
let you out of jail.

01:34:36.178 --> 01:34:38.305
Hey, what are you
guys doing here?

01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:39.348
I took Will over

01:34:39.415 --> 01:34:41.076
to the new apartment,
so he could see his room.

01:34:41.150 --> 01:34:43.380
He liked it.

01:34:43.452 --> 01:34:44.714
We were on our
way back to Mom's.

01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:45.844
I saw your truck outside.

01:34:46.088 --> 01:34:47.646
Happy New Year.

01:34:47.723 --> 01:34:51.853
It's a day or two early, but...
hey, I got faith.

01:34:52.094 --> 01:34:53.254
Thank you.

01:34:53.329 --> 01:34:55.422
To the good life.

01:34:57.833 --> 01:34:59.664
You call this the good life?

01:34:59.735 --> 01:35:01.134
Sure looks like it
from where I stand.

01:35:05.341 --> 01:35:08.139
It occurs to me
I forgot to give you

01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:09.507
your Christmas present.

01:35:09.579 --> 01:35:11.570
Call your wife.

01:35:12.782 --> 01:35:14.340
Telephone's right there.

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:15.645
You don't understand...

01:35:15.751 --> 01:35:16.718
Do it.

01:35:41.077 --> 01:35:43.238
Hi, it's me.

01:35:43.312 --> 01:35:45.371
Yeah.

01:35:45.448 --> 01:35:46.608
I... I know.

01:35:46.682 --> 01:35:51.278
Hey... don't cry.

01:35:51.354 --> 01:35:54.050
Dad... I can handle
this part myself.

01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:56.455
You'd keep my leg,
wouldn't you?

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.458
You don't need a leg...
you need a parrot.

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.699
Should we give him back his leg?

01:36:12.174 --> 01:36:15.610
You want to take it to him?

01:36:17.113 --> 01:36:18.705
It's not alive...
it ain't gonna bite you.

01:36:26.756 --> 01:36:28.724
You still got that stopwatch?

01:36:30.393 --> 01:36:31.485
Want to see if it works?

01:37:05.561 --> 01:37:06.493
Come on.

01:37:06.562 --> 01:37:08.621
You think...?

01:37:32.588 --> 01:37:34.385
Thank you.

01:37:46.135 --> 01:37:50.231
Will... your mom wants
to talk to you.

01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:53.072
Mom?

01:37:59.381 --> 01:38:00.313
Dick.

01:38:00.382 --> 01:38:02.475
You know,
I think I'm getting

01:38:02.551 --> 01:38:04.178
too old for this job.

01:38:04.253 --> 01:38:05.254
How come?

01:38:05.254 --> 01:38:08.257
You're starting
to look good to me.

01:38:08.257 --> 01:38:11.556
I do that...
I grow on people.

01:38:16.465 --> 01:38:19.662
Sommelier, encore,
s'il vous plaît.

01:38:23.606 --> 01:38:26.734
Listen, I need a favor.

01:38:26.809 --> 01:38:30.301
I'm serious about this.

01:38:30.379 --> 01:38:32.108
It's your landlady.

01:38:32.181 --> 01:38:34.672
She's done something for you.

01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:35.808
What?

01:38:35.885 --> 01:38:40.322
You own the house
on Bowdin again.

01:38:40.389 --> 01:38:43.688
She paid the back taxes.

01:38:47.329 --> 01:38:48.387
And you let her?

01:38:48.464 --> 01:38:49.624
I encouraged her.

01:38:49.698 --> 01:38:51.461
Fine! She paid the taxes;
she owns it.

01:38:51.534 --> 01:38:54.526
I told you I didn't want
anything to do with that place.

01:38:54.603 --> 01:38:56.468
This isn't about
what you want.

01:38:56.539 --> 01:38:58.530
I don't give a damn
what you want.

01:38:58.607 --> 01:39:01.235
This is about need.

01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:05.644
Clive Jr.'s gone;
he's not coming back.

01:39:07.082 --> 01:39:09.744
Now, this is the favor:

01:39:09.819 --> 01:39:13.756
When she tells you...

01:39:13.756 --> 01:39:15.485
be grateful.

01:39:15.558 --> 01:39:18.459
Make her feel good.

01:39:18.527 --> 01:39:22.258
Is that too much to ask?

01:39:22.331 --> 01:39:27.792
Sully, either you do this,
or... I'm off of you for life.

01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:31.203
I mean it.

01:39:31.273 --> 01:39:32.638
Dad?

01:39:32.741 --> 01:39:34.675
Dad.

01:39:35.911 --> 01:39:37.435
Yeah?

01:39:37.513 --> 01:39:41.210
Could you and Rub spare me
for a couple days?

01:39:41.283 --> 01:39:43.717
Well, Rub sure could.

01:39:43.819 --> 01:39:45.582
How 'bout you?

01:39:45.654 --> 01:39:47.622
Okay.

01:39:51.126 --> 01:39:55.119
Uh... could be more
than a couple days.

01:39:55.197 --> 01:39:56.630
Well, you run into problems,

01:39:56.699 --> 01:39:58.826
just think what I would do,
and then...

01:39:58.901 --> 01:40:00.300
Do the opposite.

01:40:00.369 --> 01:40:01.859
I'll remember that.

01:40:01.937 --> 01:40:05.566
Oh. Almost forgot.

01:40:05.641 --> 01:40:07.165
What's that?

01:40:07.243 --> 01:40:09.945
Here.
What do you think it is?

01:40:09.945 --> 01:40:12.436
It's a trifecta ticket.

01:40:18.354 --> 01:40:20.845
The trifecta ticket?

01:40:20.923 --> 01:40:23.221
The one that hit?

01:40:27.363 --> 01:40:28.489
How much?

01:40:28.564 --> 01:40:30.930
5,800 bucks.

01:40:31.166 --> 01:40:32.633
And you bet it?

01:40:32.701 --> 01:40:35.363
You told me to, remember?

01:40:35.437 --> 01:40:37.166
Right before you went to jail.

01:40:40.643 --> 01:40:41.803
Oh, wow.

01:40:41.877 --> 01:40:43.344
How about that?

01:40:43.412 --> 01:40:47.576
Intelligence, hard work
and good looks finally pay off.

01:40:47.650 --> 01:40:50.312
And to think
we were here to see it.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.154
Wow.

01:42:27.282 --> 01:42:30.342
Hey, try anything
and you'll regret it!

01:42:41.563 --> 01:42:45.761
Oh, no... not a chance.

01:43:17.933 --> 01:43:19.298
Oh...!

01:43:20.836 --> 01:43:22.531
Who are you?

01:43:31.513 --> 01:43:35.779
I fixed the railing
on the porch.

01:43:38.954 --> 01:43:41.479
Can I come in
and pull my boots off?

01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:43.717
Of course, Donald.

01:43:47.563 --> 01:43:51.499
Looks like you're the only one
in town who'll have me.

01:43:51.633 --> 01:43:55.296
I hope you didn't... rent my
room out from underneath me.

01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:57.736
Not yet.

01:43:57.806 --> 01:44:00.900
By the way,
what's your policy on pets?

01:44:03.712 --> 01:44:04.872
I'm not sure.

01:44:04.947 --> 01:44:09.247
Well... we'll come
up with something.

01:44:12.554 --> 01:44:13.919
I'm going to have a cup of tea.

01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.883
Would you like one?

01:44:14.957 --> 01:44:17.824
No. Not now, not ever.

01:44:22.764 --> 01:44:24.823
I'm sorry about Clive Jr.

01:44:26.535 --> 01:44:29.265
Thank you, Donald.

01:44:29.338 --> 01:44:32.608
I keep thinking
I failed him in some way.

01:44:32.608 --> 01:44:34.508
At least you raised him.

01:44:34.610 --> 01:44:38.740
That's more than I can say.

01:44:38.814 --> 01:44:42.841
There's a rumor around town
that you did a good deed.

01:44:42.918 --> 01:44:46.786
You stuck your nose
where it didn't belong.

01:44:46.855 --> 01:44:49.824
I know it.

01:44:49.892 --> 01:44:52.360
I'm an old woman, though;
I'm entitled.

01:44:59.368 --> 01:45:01.233
Well, you're forgiven.

01:45:01.303 --> 01:45:03.863
Thank you.

01:45:05.541 --> 01:45:08.738
Are you sure I can't interest
you in a cup of tea?

01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:11.870
No, and how many times
do I have to tell you?

01:45:11.947 --> 01:45:14.279
Other people change
their minds occasionally.

01:45:14.349 --> 01:45:17.716
I keep thinking you might.

01:45:17.786 --> 01:45:20.516
You do?

01:45:22.925 --> 01:45:25.450
Huh.

01:45:50.352 --> 01:45:53.219
You may as well come in, too.

55:52.624 --> 55:54.859
You spoke to Toby?

55:54.859 --> 55:56.156
Yeah.

55:56.228 --> 55:57.786
I didn't have the heart
to remind her

55:57.896 --> 55:58.954
who she was talking about.

55:59.030 --> 56:01.931
You... you talked to my wife?

56:03.969 --> 56:05.698
Well, forget about it.

56:05.770 --> 56:09.171
She's probably just telling
people she likes.

56:13.645 --> 56:16.512
Don't tell me she's pregnant.

56:16.581 --> 56:18.572
Knocked up like a cheerleader.

56:22.187 --> 56:24.883
Eh, I suppose now you're going
to want to be godfather.

56:24.956 --> 56:28.756
Hey... I can't be the father
and the godfather.

56:28.827 --> 56:30.294
You got to goddamn
do something.

56:30.362 --> 56:32.523
Great white hunter make baby.

56:32.597 --> 56:33.962
Hah!

56:35.033 --> 56:36.762
Well, big guy,

56:36.835 --> 56:38.132
down to some business, here.

56:38.203 --> 56:39.966
I understand you got
this Victorian

56:40.038 --> 56:41.906
- that you're going to remodel.
- No way.

56:41.906 --> 56:43.168
It'll give us six months work...

56:43.241 --> 56:44.731
- most of it indoors.
- Forget about it.

56:44.809 --> 56:46.606
I got my son to worry about now.

56:46.678 --> 56:48.168
Don't even waste your breath,
Sully.

56:48.246 --> 56:50.180
Victorian house
is a big job.

56:50.248 --> 56:51.647
I need guys with two good knees

56:51.783 --> 56:53.652
and at least a half a brain
between them.

56:53.652 --> 56:55.643
Guy with half a brain
wouldn't work for you.

56:57.722 --> 56:58.984
Drop it.

56:59.057 --> 57:02.026
I should've known better than to
bring it up to someone like you.

57:02.093 --> 57:03.583
Come on, hotshot.

57:03.662 --> 57:05.789
That rattrap of yours
still standing over on Bowdin?

57:05.864 --> 57:07.798
Why?

57:07.866 --> 57:08.855
Come on.

57:08.933 --> 57:11.163
Let's go take a look at it.

57:11.236 --> 57:13.602
I got an idea I want
to talk to you about.

57:16.007 --> 57:18.532
Breaks your heart,
doesn't it?

57:18.610 --> 57:20.945
You know who he reminds me of?

57:20.945 --> 57:22.207
You.

57:22.280 --> 57:25.078
Yeah, he is pretty well hung
at that.

57:36.661 --> 57:39.095
Stay down here for a second,
will you, Will?

57:41.032 --> 57:42.966
Watch your step, Grandpop.

57:55.246 --> 57:56.372
Hey, hey, Sully.

57:56.681 --> 57:58.706
Hey, Sully, wait a minute.

57:58.783 --> 58:00.216
Why don't you just break
one of the windowpanes

58:00.285 --> 58:01.684
and reach inside
and unlock the door.

58:01.753 --> 58:03.880
I know what I'm doing, okay?

58:13.365 --> 58:14.889
Don't say a word.

58:17.001 --> 58:18.628
Excuse me.

58:39.290 --> 58:41.281
I don't know.

58:42.360 --> 58:44.225
I don't know.

58:44.295 --> 58:47.093
I may owe Rub an apology.

58:47.165 --> 58:50.794
He may not be
the dumbest man in Bath.

58:55.407 --> 58:58.240
Goddamn, Sully,
you could've saved this place.

58:58.309 --> 59:01.642
Could've fixed it up
a little bit, rented it out.

59:01.713 --> 59:05.149
Hell, you could've sold it... put
the money in your own pocket.

59:07.218 --> 59:10.153
But you just let it rot.

59:10.221 --> 59:13.679
Just so you could stick it
to your old man, huh?

59:14.759 --> 59:17.023
What's he been dead,
30, 35 years?

59:17.095 --> 59:20.155
You still keeping score?

59:20.231 --> 59:25.032
Well, here's the good news:
You won.

59:25.103 --> 59:27.799
This could be your crowning
achievement, Sully.

59:31.109 --> 59:34.101
All right,
I'll make you a deal.

59:34.179 --> 59:37.115
You sell me this flooring here,
at a reasonable price,

59:37.115 --> 59:39.310
and I'll let you
and the other two stooges

59:39.384 --> 59:40.976
work on the Victorian house.

59:43.054 --> 59:45.249
Sully.

59:45.323 --> 59:48.258
You okay?

59:50.895 --> 59:53.022
Take it.

59:53.097 --> 59:54.394
What?

59:54.632 --> 59:55.826
Take it.
Just...

59:56.901 --> 01:00:00.667
Pull out whatever you want.

01:00:00.738 --> 01:00:03.002
Give the money
to Peter, okay?

01:00:03.074 --> 01:00:05.668
Hey, where's that little kid?

01:00:09.647 --> 01:00:11.638
Will?

01:00:14.719 --> 01:00:17.950
You didn't think
I forgot you, did you?

01:00:18.022 --> 01:00:19.387
Huh?

01:00:19.457 --> 01:00:23.018
Well, I...
I didn't mean to.

01:00:25.663 --> 01:00:27.961
You want to go inside

01:00:28.032 --> 01:00:29.056
and see where I grew up?

01:00:29.133 --> 01:00:30.964
You'd like it.

01:00:33.071 --> 01:00:35.437
Okay, you decide.

01:00:35.673 --> 01:00:37.140
You can come inside
with me or...

01:00:37.208 --> 01:00:38.971
or you can go back
and see your dad.

01:00:39.043 --> 01:00:40.271
Okay.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:42.245
Okay, which?

01:00:44.382 --> 01:00:46.907
Go see Dad.

01:00:49.954 --> 01:00:52.946
Sure. Okay. Let's go.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.643
Your dad's right
over there, okay?

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:19.873
Hey.

01:01:24.122 --> 01:01:26.147
It's okay.

01:01:29.127 --> 01:01:30.924
You forgot him?

01:01:30.995 --> 01:01:33.623
Well, it couldn't have been more
than a couple of minutes.

01:01:33.698 --> 01:01:36.098
Yeah, well it probably
seemed like longer to him.

01:01:36.167 --> 01:01:38.135
Probably seemed like...
forever to him.

01:01:38.202 --> 01:01:41.103
You know, you...
God, I should've known.

01:01:41.172 --> 01:01:44.733
You're never going
to change, are you?

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:22.006
I'd like to talk to Will.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:25.743
I'd like to talk
to my grandson.

01:02:32.423 --> 01:02:34.323
Hey, hotshot.

01:02:36.861 --> 01:02:38.761
Kind of messed up today,
didn't I?

01:02:42.266 --> 01:02:44.894
I mean, you were pretty scared,
weren't you?

01:02:49.974 --> 01:02:51.407
You know what I used to do

01:02:51.476 --> 01:02:53.774
when I was your age
and I got scared?

01:02:53.845 --> 01:02:58.214
I'd try to be brave
for exactly a minute,

01:02:58.282 --> 01:03:00.409
and the next time,

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:02.711
I'd try to be brave
for two minutes.

01:03:02.787 --> 01:03:05.950
What were you scared of?

01:03:06.024 --> 01:03:10.893
I don't remember, but, hey...

01:03:10.962 --> 01:03:15.296
when you get to be my age,
you won't remember either.

01:03:15.366 --> 01:03:17.357
Here.

01:03:20.738 --> 01:03:23.138
You can time
yourself with it.

01:03:23.207 --> 01:03:26.233
The big hand'll go around once...
that'll be a minute.

01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:29.245
Goes around again...
that'll be two minutes.

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:32.180
Then you can tell how long
you've been brave.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:35.185
Here.

01:03:36.921 --> 01:03:39.287
Thank you.

01:03:41.259 --> 01:03:43.284
You're welcome.

01:03:53.738 --> 01:03:55.399
Can I ask you a question?

01:03:57.942 --> 01:03:59.773
Why'd you do it...

01:03:59.844 --> 01:04:00.936
walk out on us?

01:04:01.012 --> 01:04:04.072
Oh... how the hell do I know?

01:04:04.148 --> 01:04:08.016
It was, um...

01:04:08.086 --> 01:04:10.919
a mistake.

01:04:10.988 --> 01:04:13.957
Me and your mother
was just a mistake.

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:17.050
What would you
like me to say?

01:04:17.128 --> 01:04:18.891
I was a rotten father?

01:04:18.963 --> 01:04:23.366
Well, I wasn't around enough
for that, remember?

01:04:23.434 --> 01:04:25.868
Not around.
Not ever.

01:04:25.937 --> 01:04:27.768
Satisfied?

01:04:27.839 --> 01:04:28.863
Well...

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.737
if you're not a father to me,

01:04:30.808 --> 01:04:33.038
how come you're
a grandfather to Will?

01:04:33.111 --> 01:04:37.673
'Cause you got to start
someplace.

01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:39.405
You alive in there,
old girl?

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.741
Didn't die in your sleep, di...

01:05:55.793 --> 01:05:57.886
Well, what happened?
What did he say?

01:05:57.962 --> 01:06:01.625
If I tell you, will you promise
not to tell my son about it?

01:06:01.766 --> 01:06:03.961
No, I can't do that.

01:06:04.035 --> 01:06:06.401
Well, then, I won't tell you.

01:06:06.704 --> 01:06:07.932
Let's go.

01:06:11.075 --> 01:06:12.440
No, I can do that.

01:06:19.283 --> 01:06:21.183
All right, I won't tell him.

01:06:21.252 --> 01:06:22.776
Now, what happened?

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:25.118
It was a stroke.

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:26.451
A what?

01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:29.093
A stroke. Just a tiny one.

01:06:29.093 --> 01:06:32.324
It's not uncommon
in people of my age,

01:06:32.396 --> 01:06:35.299
but he gave me medication,
and he said if I'm careful,

01:06:35.299 --> 01:06:38.200
there's no reason I shouldn't
live for a long time.

01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:39.964
I'm calling Clive Jr.
Right now.

01:06:40.037 --> 01:06:41.299
No, no, Donald, you promised.

01:06:41.372 --> 01:06:42.771
He's your son.
He's got a right.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.102
Donald.

01:06:44.175 --> 01:06:47.406
If you tell Clive about this,
he'll put me in a rest home,

01:06:47.478 --> 01:06:49.969
and there'll be nothing
I can do about it.

01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:53.073
You know I'm right
about that.

01:06:54.418 --> 01:06:57.046
And if he did...

01:06:57.121 --> 01:06:59.783
I don't think I could bear it.

01:06:59.857 --> 01:07:02.291
Okay, but, uh...

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.328
you're going to...

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.863
need someone who can
really look after you.

01:07:06.931 --> 01:07:08.330
I have someone to look after me.

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:10.390
No, no, I don't think so.

01:07:10.468 --> 01:07:12.936
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:07:13.004 --> 01:07:17.065
Do you still bet
on that horse race of yours?

01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:18.904
What, the trifecta?

01:07:18.976 --> 01:07:20.204
Yes.
Has it ever come in?

01:07:20.278 --> 01:07:21.870
Not yet.

01:07:21.946 --> 01:07:23.140
But you still bet on it.

01:07:23.214 --> 01:07:24.340
Well, sure, I mean,

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:26.110
the odds have got to kick in
sooner or later.

01:07:26.183 --> 01:07:28.981
Fine... that's exactly the way
I feel about you.

01:07:29.053 --> 01:07:30.179
Now, will you please

01:07:30.254 --> 01:07:32.279
drive me home?

01:07:36.193 --> 01:07:38.787
Thank you, Donald.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:42.161
Wish you hadn't told me
those were rats down there.

01:07:42.233 --> 01:07:44.963
Know what else I wish?

01:07:45.036 --> 01:07:46.435
What?

01:07:46.537 --> 01:07:49.836
I wish some big old company
would moved to town,

01:07:49.907 --> 01:07:52.467
pay us a lot of money.

01:07:52.543 --> 01:07:54.909
We could work indoors.

01:07:54.979 --> 01:07:57.915
No more Carl Roebuck.

01:07:57.915 --> 01:08:01.146
Know what I really wish?

01:08:01.218 --> 01:08:05.056
I really wish Peter'd
quit calling me "Sancho."

01:08:05.056 --> 01:08:06.421
I hate that name.

01:08:06.724 --> 01:08:11.684
Fact is, I wish Peter'd
just flat go away.

01:08:11.762 --> 01:08:12.786
What?

01:08:12.863 --> 01:08:17.162
I said, I wish Peter'd
go on back to his own home.

01:08:17.234 --> 01:08:20.225
I liked it better when
it was just the two of us.

01:08:20.337 --> 01:08:24.671
I hate it the way you talk
to him all the time.

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:32.715
You know, used to be you
and me'd go places together.

01:08:32.783 --> 01:08:34.751
Now he's always there.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.343
He's my son.

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.979
Shh. He's coming.

01:08:39.055 --> 01:08:40.080
Hey, Sancho.

01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:41.145
See what I mean?

01:08:41.225 --> 01:08:42.852
- Any luck?
- Yeah.

01:08:42.926 --> 01:08:43.859
I think I found a place.

01:08:43.928 --> 01:08:45.395
- Hey.
- What place?

01:08:45.462 --> 01:08:47.260
Two bedroom apartment
for me and Will.

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:48.798
It's in a nice neighborhood,

01:08:48.866 --> 01:08:50.493
rent's not too bad.

01:08:50.734 --> 01:08:52.497
You mean, you're...
you're going to stay?

01:08:52.803 --> 01:08:56.170
Yeah. Pretty much
made up my mind.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:00.176
He's going to... stay here,
work with us from now on?

01:09:00.243 --> 01:09:02.178
Looks like it.

01:09:02.246 --> 01:09:03.941
Well, wh...

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:06.676
there's not enough work
for the three of us.

01:09:06.751 --> 01:09:09.049
Why don't you let me
worry about that.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.055
Well, I don't like it.

01:09:12.055 --> 01:09:13.148
You don't
have to like it.

01:09:17.495 --> 01:09:21.022
Hey, Sully, could I have a beer?

01:09:21.131 --> 01:09:22.064
What are you asking me for?

01:09:22.133 --> 01:09:23.760
'Cause you're the boss.

01:09:23.834 --> 01:09:24.765
Ask him.

01:09:24.835 --> 01:09:25.995
He bought the beer.

01:09:26.069 --> 01:09:27.662
Here you go, Sancho.

01:09:41.419 --> 01:09:42.977
Hey, where you going?

01:09:52.095 --> 01:09:54.029
I quit.

01:09:55.966 --> 01:09:57.331
Rub!

01:09:57.401 --> 01:09:59.460
Shit. Oh...

01:09:59.537 --> 01:10:02.005
Come on back here.

01:10:24.361 --> 01:10:27.262
Dad... Dad, you're
driving on the sidewalk.

01:10:27.331 --> 01:10:28.889
Relax.

01:10:28.966 --> 01:10:29.990
Look at that.

01:10:30.067 --> 01:10:32.035
You ever seen anybody
that stubborn?

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:34.071
Yes, I have.

01:10:35.906 --> 01:10:36.930
Can't figure it out.

01:10:37.007 --> 01:10:37.974
All he's got to do

01:10:38.042 --> 01:10:40.237
is duck behind something
and we're screwed.

01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:42.245
Oh, I'd have to say
we're screwed anyhow.

01:10:55.593 --> 01:10:57.220
Sully, you're on the sidewalk!

01:10:58.562 --> 01:11:00.052
Up yours, Raymer.

01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:21.181
That's not a good place to park,

01:11:21.252 --> 01:11:22.480
Raymer.

01:11:22.553 --> 01:11:24.783
Enough!

01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.287
Get out of the truck now, Sully!

01:11:28.359 --> 01:11:30.020
Fun's over...
I'm going to have

01:11:30.094 --> 01:11:31.755
to put you under arrest.

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:36.857
This is where a smart guy
would get out of the truck.

01:11:36.934 --> 01:11:38.492
- Come on, Dad.
- Suit yourself.

01:11:45.109 --> 01:11:46.770
Halt!

01:11:46.877 --> 01:11:48.139
Jesus, Dad!

01:11:48.212 --> 01:11:49.543
He'll never use it.

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:55.181
Did he shoot?

01:11:55.252 --> 01:11:56.879
I believe that
was a gunshot, yes.

01:11:56.954 --> 01:11:59.252
I vote we surrender,
if I have a vote.

01:12:19.109 --> 01:12:22.010
You stupid prick.

01:12:31.956 --> 01:12:33.753
Well?

01:12:33.857 --> 01:12:34.949
Nothing.

01:12:35.025 --> 01:12:36.959
Good.

01:12:37.027 --> 01:12:39.154
For a moment there, I thought
you were going to be critical.

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:42.028
Haven't I been warning you
about something like this?

01:12:42.099 --> 01:12:43.031
Clive...

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:44.761
Haven't I?
The man's a lunatic.

01:12:44.835 --> 01:12:46.234
I'm sure there's
an explanation.

01:12:46.303 --> 01:12:49.568
What explanation can there be
for attacking a policeman?

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.404
I suppose I should be grateful
he didn't go berserk right here

01:12:52.476 --> 01:12:53.602
in this house.

01:12:53.844 --> 01:12:57.507
I want Donald Sullivan
out of here,

01:12:57.581 --> 01:12:59.947
and I want him out of here now.

01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:06.082
And if you won't do it,

01:13:06.156 --> 01:13:08.147
I will.

01:13:15.099 --> 01:13:16.896
Hmm... I hate to say it,

01:13:16.967 --> 01:13:20.198
but for once in his life,
The Bank is right.

01:13:20.271 --> 01:13:23.035
I screwed up.

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:26.338
Looks like I'll be spending a...

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:28.571
a little vacation
at the County's expense,

01:13:28.812 --> 01:13:31.076
so you'd better get yourself
another tenant.

01:13:31.148 --> 01:13:33.582
I don't want another tenant.

01:13:33.817 --> 01:13:35.842
I've enjoyed your company.

01:13:35.919 --> 01:13:39.787
Face it, Beryl,
I'm the wrong man for the job.

01:13:39.857 --> 01:13:41.950
Maybe it'll teach us both

01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:44.085
not to bet on long shots.

01:13:56.473 --> 01:13:58.532
What do you think?

01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:05.840
Sure doesn't feel
like Christmas.

01:14:08.452 --> 01:14:10.443
Get Rub to help you
with the floors.

01:14:10.554 --> 01:14:11.748
Don't forget.

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.756
Okay.

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.258
You can always get him down
at the diner, you know.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.555
Right.

01:14:18.796 --> 01:14:20.286
You know how to use
a circular saw?

01:14:20.364 --> 01:14:23.162
Better than you.

01:14:23.233 --> 01:14:25.497
I doubt it.

01:14:25.602 --> 01:14:29.003
How long do you think
it'll take you to finish?

01:14:29.073 --> 01:14:30.062
Couple of days.

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:31.767
Hmm. Well, get Rub...

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:33.070
Get Rub to help.

01:14:35.312 --> 01:14:39.112
Did I give you the
keys to the Ford?

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:40.484
About an hour and a half ago.

01:14:40.484 --> 01:14:42.281
Well, if you get
any trouble with it,

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.287
just take it down
to the Texaco station.

01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:46.516
There's a guy down there
by the name of Harold.

01:14:46.824 --> 01:14:47.381
He's the owner.

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:49.255
Just tell him you're my son.

01:14:49.326 --> 01:14:52.887
Right. You run into problems,
drop your old man's name.

01:14:52.963 --> 01:14:54.453
Watch the doors fly open.

01:14:54.531 --> 01:14:57.432
Can't believe it's going
to take you that long

01:14:57.501 --> 01:14:58.991
to get me out of jail.

01:14:59.069 --> 01:15:00.468
Don't blame me...
I'm a Jew.

01:15:00.771 --> 01:15:02.261
These aren't my holidays.

01:15:02.339 --> 01:15:03.772
A Jew... really?

01:15:05.809 --> 01:15:08.209
I didn't know that.

01:15:08.278 --> 01:15:10.371
How come you ain't smart?

01:15:13.016 --> 01:15:16.452
How can I start getting
you out of jail

01:15:16.587 --> 01:15:18.555
when you won't go in?

01:15:18.789 --> 01:15:19.983
Got a point.

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:32.928
A condemned man gets
a last wish, right?

01:15:35.005 --> 01:15:36.370
I got my truck out back.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.965
How 'bout you and me go out
there and get ourselves naked

01:15:39.042 --> 01:15:40.339
and then just
see what happens?

01:15:43.046 --> 01:15:44.240
Okay.

01:15:44.314 --> 01:15:46.544
Haven't you got any pride?

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:48.174
Go to jail, Sully.

01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:50.117
It's where you belong.

01:15:50.187 --> 01:15:52.155
Look, your kid's asleep.

01:15:55.359 --> 01:15:59.989
I haven't seen him like this
since he was six months old.

01:16:05.335 --> 01:16:07.235
Touching, isn't it?

01:16:07.304 --> 01:16:09.169
Breaks your heart.

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:11.468
Wake up.

01:16:11.608 --> 01:16:13.132
Oh, God...

01:16:13.210 --> 01:16:14.871
let's get out of here.

01:16:18.182 --> 01:16:21.515
- Get the check, will you?
- I'll pay your check.

01:16:23.153 --> 01:16:25.522
You okay?

01:16:25.522 --> 01:16:27.046
Yeah.

01:16:27.124 --> 01:16:29.991
Wirf will have you out
of there in a couple of days.

01:16:32.196 --> 01:16:35.222
Ralph's been a good father
to you, you know?

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:38.359
Yes, he has.

01:16:38.435 --> 01:16:40.369
You turned out all right.

01:16:40.437 --> 01:16:44.032
So did you.

01:16:44.141 --> 01:16:46.837
Want to hear something funny?

01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:49.902
I never told anybody
this before.

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.607
After I got out of the Army,

01:16:51.849 --> 01:16:54.249
I went to college
for about six months.

01:16:54.318 --> 01:16:56.252
I really liked it.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.185
Why did you quit?

01:16:58.255 --> 01:17:00.780
I said I liked it...
I didn't say I belonged there.

01:17:00.858 --> 01:17:03.258
Well, where do you belong, Dad?

01:17:05.996 --> 01:17:07.486
Right there.

01:17:10.267 --> 01:17:12.462
For tonight, anyway.

01:17:12.569 --> 01:17:15.766
Want me to go
in there with you?

01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:17.033
Nope.

01:17:17.107 --> 01:17:18.369
Good.

01:17:27.985 --> 01:17:30.283
Well, I'll be out
before you know it.

01:17:35.425 --> 01:17:36.551
Hey!

01:17:38.095 --> 01:17:40.256
Look after Wirf, will you?

01:17:41.899 --> 01:17:43.196
And Miss Beryl?

01:17:43.267 --> 01:17:45.098
Right.

01:17:49.907 --> 01:17:51.238
Oh...

01:17:54.144 --> 01:17:56.908
Take care of Rub's jelly donuts.

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:59.414
It's not going to be easy
being you, is it?

01:17:59.483 --> 01:18:00.916
Don't expect too much

01:18:00.984 --> 01:18:02.383
of yourself
at the beginning.

01:18:02.486 --> 01:18:05.512
I couldn't do everything
at first, either.

01:18:35.886 --> 01:18:37.444
But you gave me your word.

01:18:37.521 --> 01:18:39.113
People here
are counting on you.

01:18:39.189 --> 01:18:40.884
I'm counting on you.

01:18:40.958 --> 01:18:43.927
Mr. Peoples, did we sign
any papers?

01:18:43.994 --> 01:18:46.019
Now, listen, this is nothing
personal.

01:18:46.096 --> 01:18:48.530
I know how much you good people
wanted this thing to happen,

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:51.397
but it's flat out
not going to work.

01:18:51.468 --> 01:18:52.833
Why?

01:18:52.903 --> 01:18:54.871
Well, the fact is
we crunched the numbers,

01:18:54.938 --> 01:18:55.996
and they didn't add up.

01:18:56.073 --> 01:18:57.540
But you don't understand.

01:18:57.608 --> 01:18:59.439
These people bought
a thousand acres

01:18:59.509 --> 01:19:01.443
of depressed real estate
because of you.

01:19:01.511 --> 01:19:03.376
Oh, you got that wrong, Clive.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:05.847
Those people bought that land
because of you.

01:19:05.916 --> 01:19:08.180
You promised that this
was a sure thing.

01:19:08.251 --> 01:19:11.015
Well, we were a teeny bit wrong
about that, wasn't we?

01:19:11.088 --> 01:19:12.282
But...

01:19:12.356 --> 01:19:14.517
It's been good talking to you.
Nighty-night.

01:19:18.328 --> 01:19:20.296
Merry Christmas, Mr. Peoples.

01:19:22.966 --> 01:19:25.127
Merry Christmas.

01:20:29.633 --> 01:20:30.600
Thanks, Ollie.

01:20:30.667 --> 01:20:32.225
God, I love small towns.

01:20:32.335 --> 01:20:33.359
Where else in the world

01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:35.166
would they let a guy
out of jail for three hours

01:20:35.238 --> 01:20:36.466
just to serve as a pall bearer?

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.541
Yeah.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:38.542
Been arraigned yet?

01:20:38.542 --> 01:20:40.100
No... this afternoon.

01:20:40.177 --> 01:20:41.371
How you going to plead?

01:20:41.445 --> 01:20:43.140
Temporary insanity.

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:45.408
We're going to say that
those pills you gave me

01:20:45.482 --> 01:20:46.608
made me absolutely nuts.

01:20:54.624 --> 01:20:56.114
All right, girls, we're on.

01:20:59.963 --> 01:21:01.396
All right, here we go.

01:21:01.465 --> 01:21:03.660
One, two, three.

01:21:06.136 --> 01:21:08.161
Well, you must
be feeling great.

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:11.264
Well, why should I be feeling
great... I'm in jail.

01:21:11.341 --> 01:21:12.467
Truck's falling apart...

01:21:12.542 --> 01:21:13.668
I haven't got
40 bucks to my name.

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:14.968
Yeah, but the trifecta

01:21:15.045 --> 01:21:17.605
you've been betting
for ten years finally hit.

01:21:17.914 --> 01:21:19.074
Hey, be careful!

01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:20.081
My trifecta?

01:21:20.150 --> 01:21:21.117
Yeah.

01:21:21.184 --> 01:21:22.879
You mean, the one I've been
betting every day?

01:21:22.953 --> 01:21:25.319
It hit two days ago.

01:21:25.388 --> 01:21:27.958
Well, I was in jail.
I didn't bet it.

01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:29.619
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?

01:21:31.194 --> 01:21:32.491
Now do you believe in luck?

01:21:32.562 --> 01:21:34.621
Luck had nothing to do
with you being in jail.

01:21:34.731 --> 01:21:36.631
Did you hear about Clive Jr.?

01:21:36.733 --> 01:21:37.893
No, what?

01:21:37.968 --> 01:21:38.935
He skipped town.

01:21:40.003 --> 01:21:40.935
- Hey!
- Oh, ho...

01:21:41.004 --> 01:21:43.199
Mr. Sullivan,
have a little respect.

01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:44.205
What?

01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:46.139
The money
for the theme park folded.

01:21:46.209 --> 01:21:49.508
Bank's stuck with all
that worthless land.

01:21:49.579 --> 01:21:51.945
So he disappeared.

01:21:52.015 --> 01:21:54.040
Well, what about Miss Beryl?

01:21:54.117 --> 01:21:56.017
Not great.

01:21:56.086 --> 01:21:57.553
Boy...

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:59.213
Guy goes to jail
for a couple of days...

01:21:59.289 --> 01:22:01.120
the whole town goes to hell.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.592
Sully?

01:22:04.661 --> 01:22:05.650
Yeah, Ralph?

01:22:05.896 --> 01:22:08.330
Listen, remember that
snowblower you gave me?

01:22:08.398 --> 01:22:09.365
Yeah?

01:22:09.432 --> 01:22:11.957
Well, somebody stole it
last night...

01:22:12.035 --> 01:22:13.900
right out of the garage.

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:18.202
I... I covered it with a tarp
just the way you told me...

01:22:18.275 --> 01:22:19.936
Don't worry about it.

01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:22.342
I know exactly
where to find it.

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.514
Never in a million years.

01:22:42.599 --> 01:22:45.500
Well... here we are again,
Mr. Sullivan.

01:22:45.569 --> 01:22:47.366
How's your knee?

01:22:47.437 --> 01:22:48.404
Rotten.

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:51.072
Your Honor.

01:22:51.141 --> 01:22:52.165
Well, it doesn't seem

01:22:52.242 --> 01:22:53.334
to slow you down much.

01:22:53.410 --> 01:22:56.470
Doesn't keep you from punching
out policemen or anything.

01:22:56.546 --> 01:22:57.478
Your Honor...

01:22:57.547 --> 01:22:58.639
Mr. Wirfley, don't.

01:22:58.715 --> 01:23:00.876
There are times
when less is more,

01:23:00.951 --> 01:23:02.043
and this is one of them.

01:23:02.118 --> 01:23:03.142
Now, then...

01:23:03.253 --> 01:23:04.550
How are you doing,
Wyatt Earp?

01:23:04.621 --> 01:23:05.553
Your Honor...

01:23:05.622 --> 01:23:06.554
Same advice:

01:23:06.623 --> 01:23:08.921
"Less is more."

01:23:10.093 --> 01:23:12.323
Tell me,
what do you usually do

01:23:12.395 --> 01:23:13.555
when somebody throws a punch
at you?

01:23:21.238 --> 01:23:22.262
Duck.

01:23:22.339 --> 01:23:24.637
Next time, do that.

01:23:24.741 --> 01:23:28.336
Now, is it true that you
discharged your weapon, Officer?

01:23:28.411 --> 01:23:30.470
Your Honor,
it was a warning shot.

01:23:30.547 --> 01:23:32.515
Mm-hmm.
You know who you warned?

01:23:32.582 --> 01:23:34.948
A little old lady sitting
on her commode

01:23:35.018 --> 01:23:36.645
two blocks away.

01:23:36.953 --> 01:23:37.647
Ollie...

01:23:37.954 --> 01:23:40.286
you know my feelings
about arming morons.

01:23:40.357 --> 01:23:42.655
You arm one,
you've got to arm them all,

01:23:42.959 --> 01:23:44.586
otherwise it wouldn't be
good sport.

01:23:44.661 --> 01:23:47.596
Your Honor, Officer Raymer
is currently under suspension.

01:23:47.664 --> 01:23:49.427
Anesthesia is what
he should be under.

01:23:49.499 --> 01:23:50.591
Your Honor!

01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:54.000
I'd just like to say, and
what's this country coming to...

01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:56.698
Raymer, shut the fuck up.

01:24:48.992 --> 01:24:53.395
Boy, I wouldn't sit here
too long.

01:24:53.463 --> 01:24:57.627
Tip of your dick'll freeze
to the top of the step.

01:24:57.701 --> 01:24:59.999
Oh, I forgot... yours ain't
that long.

01:25:01.504 --> 01:25:04.166
Yours ain't either.

01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:06.640
It's 'cause I fold it.

01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:10.373
Want to know how many times
I fold it?

01:25:10.447 --> 01:25:12.574
It would hurt
if you folded it.

01:25:12.682 --> 01:25:14.274
Not mine.

01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:24.226
Know what I wish?

01:25:24.327 --> 01:25:25.885
No. What do you wish?

01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:31.327
I wish we were still friends.

01:25:33.136 --> 01:25:34.569
We are, Rub.

01:25:37.474 --> 01:25:39.271
You know what I wish?

01:25:39.342 --> 01:25:41.708
I wish we'd get off our asses.

01:25:41.945 --> 01:25:44.004
Let's go down to The Horse
and place some poker.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.707
What do you think?

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:51.483
Wha-what about...

01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:54.285
Peter?

01:25:56.292 --> 01:25:58.590
Hey, look at me.

01:26:01.631 --> 01:26:03.963
Peter's my son...

01:26:07.003 --> 01:26:10.996
and you're my best friend, okay?

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:21.240
Ah...

01:26:21.317 --> 01:26:23.046
you're not going to start
crying, are you?

01:26:27.357 --> 01:26:29.723
I should've stayed in jail.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.305
I can bet 40.

01:26:45.375 --> 01:26:46.776
Oh, boy.

01:26:46.776 --> 01:26:49.279
I'm in.

01:26:49.279 --> 01:26:51.144
I don't want to be
in, but I'm in.

01:26:51.214 --> 01:26:52.203
Okay, sucker.

01:26:52.315 --> 01:26:53.509
I'll see you...

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:54.515
and...

01:26:56.653 --> 01:26:59.281
I'll raise you.

01:26:59.355 --> 01:27:01.653
He's bluffing.

01:27:01.724 --> 01:27:03.954
Goddamn it, Birdy,
close the door.

01:27:04.027 --> 01:27:05.460
I'm sitting here naked.

01:27:05.528 --> 01:27:06.893
Then you should play
better poker.

01:27:06.963 --> 01:27:08.294
Jocko.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:12.434
He's in.

01:27:12.502 --> 01:27:13.901
Oh, thank you, Birdy.

01:27:13.970 --> 01:27:14.902
Mm-hmm.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.268
Don't show him
your cards, Rub.

01:27:20.343 --> 01:27:21.708
I call.

01:27:24.647 --> 01:27:26.615
Ace-high flush.

01:27:26.683 --> 01:27:29.049
Read 'em and weep, guys.

01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:30.086
Queens full.

01:27:30.153 --> 01:27:31.154
Why not?

01:27:31.154 --> 01:27:33.281
Damn, why shouldn't
this be the night

01:27:33.356 --> 01:27:35.586
I lose every goddamn
hand in the game.

01:27:36.659 --> 01:27:38.650
Goddamn theme park
goes down the tubes...

01:27:38.728 --> 01:27:40.958
I'm stuck with 14 crappy,
half-built houses

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:42.998
I'm never going
to be able to unload...

01:27:43.066 --> 01:27:44.260
and on top of all of it,

01:27:44.334 --> 01:27:46.268
for some reason
Toby has taken exception

01:27:46.336 --> 01:27:47.735
with my new secretary.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:50.132
Whose gun is that?

01:27:50.206 --> 01:27:53.573
It's yours, bonehead.
It was your ante.

01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:55.278
Hell, I should've busted
this game two hours ago.

01:27:55.278 --> 01:27:56.279
All right.

01:27:56.279 --> 01:27:57.678
The game is seven
card stud.

01:27:57.747 --> 01:28:00.011
One-eyed jacks
and suicide kings are wild.

01:28:00.083 --> 01:28:01.516
Oh, come on, Jocko.

01:28:01.584 --> 01:28:02.448
What are all
these wild cards?

01:28:02.519 --> 01:28:03.884
Can we just play a
normal game of poker?

01:28:03.953 --> 01:28:06.683
How come she's staring
at me like that?

01:28:06.923 --> 01:28:09.016
Because you're
a good-looking guy, Rub.

01:28:09.092 --> 01:28:10.059
Am not.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.185
Sure, you are.

01:28:12.262 --> 01:28:14.696
Carl, is he
a good-looking guy?

01:28:14.931 --> 01:28:16.057
He is at that.

01:28:16.132 --> 01:28:17.099
Oh.

01:28:19.135 --> 01:28:21.330
Sully, you might want to drop by
the Bowdin Street house

01:28:21.404 --> 01:28:22.336
on the way home.

01:28:22.405 --> 01:28:24.100
- Oh, something wrong?
- No, nothing's wrong.

01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:25.903
I left you a little
something over there.

01:28:25.975 --> 01:28:28.068
Spirit of the season,
so to speak.

01:28:31.948 --> 01:28:33.540
- Jocko.
- Hmm?

01:28:33.616 --> 01:28:35.709
You got any of those
yellow doozies around?

01:28:35.952 --> 01:28:37.044
Why, is your leg worse?

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.052
No.

01:28:38.121 --> 01:28:40.282
They're for Carl.

01:28:40.356 --> 01:28:44.486
Oh, my God.

01:28:47.564 --> 01:28:48.565
Here.

01:28:48.565 --> 01:28:50.533
Two tickets... Hawaii.
You and me.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.067
Toby...

01:28:52.135 --> 01:28:55.195
There's a perfectly logical
explanation for this.

01:28:55.271 --> 01:28:57.432
There is?

01:28:57.507 --> 01:28:58.439
Well?

01:28:58.508 --> 01:28:59.736
Hawaii?

01:28:59.809 --> 01:29:03.006
No bullshit?

01:29:03.079 --> 01:29:04.603
No bullshit.

01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:08.110
Goddamn, Sully,

01:29:08.184 --> 01:29:10.049
when your luck turns...

01:29:10.119 --> 01:29:11.108
it turns.

01:29:11.187 --> 01:29:14.350
Luck has nothing
to do with this.

01:29:14.424 --> 01:29:17.621
I'll have to get
a new bathing suit.

01:29:17.694 --> 01:29:19.127
The place we're going,
you won't need anything.

01:29:19.195 --> 01:29:20.628
I have enough coconut oil
for both of us.

01:29:20.697 --> 01:29:23.723
I do you, and you do me.

01:29:23.967 --> 01:29:25.229
Yeah, that's the general idea.

01:29:25.301 --> 01:29:27.428
Oh, for God's sake, Toby...
you're pregnant.

01:29:27.503 --> 01:29:28.731
You can be the godfather.

01:29:28.972 --> 01:29:29.734
Shut up, Sully!

01:29:29.973 --> 01:29:32.066
Sunny skies.

01:29:32.141 --> 01:29:33.506
Sandy beaches.

01:29:33.576 --> 01:29:36.409
No more snow, no more
broken-down pickup truck.

01:29:36.479 --> 01:29:37.537
Oh, yeah.

01:29:37.647 --> 01:29:39.979
Damn, Carl,
you going to let him

01:29:40.049 --> 01:29:41.573
get away with that?

01:29:41.651 --> 01:29:43.744
Aw, don't worry
about it, Ollie.

01:29:43.987 --> 01:29:45.978
He'll never go
through with it.

01:29:46.055 --> 01:29:47.454
You want to bet?

01:29:47.523 --> 01:29:49.582
Cash me in, guys.

01:29:49.692 --> 01:29:51.284
Oh, I'll bet.

01:29:51.361 --> 01:29:53.591
I'll bet you make it

01:29:53.730 --> 01:29:56.096
about as far as the plane
out of spite.

01:29:56.165 --> 01:29:58.326
But then you know what's going
to happen, Sully?

01:29:58.401 --> 01:29:59.993
Somewhere over Kansas,

01:30:00.069 --> 01:30:02.094
Toby's going to start crying,

01:30:02.171 --> 01:30:03.536
and as your ex-wife
can tell you, Sully,

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:05.130
you don't handle that shit
very well.

01:30:08.544 --> 01:30:11.012
Rub...

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.446
in about a minute,
that poor son of a bitch

01:30:13.516 --> 01:30:14.540
is going to realize

01:30:14.617 --> 01:30:17.051
he's made the biggest
mistake of his life.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.386
He tries to follow
us, shoot him.

01:30:28.498 --> 01:30:29.522
Sully.

01:30:30.733 --> 01:30:32.758
You got something to say?

01:30:44.213 --> 01:30:45.612
No.

01:30:49.085 --> 01:30:50.245
Fine.

01:31:58.521 --> 01:32:00.148
- Toby...
- No, don't.

01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:02.248
Please, don't.

01:32:02.325 --> 01:32:06.125
I want to thank you
for thinking of me.

01:32:06.195 --> 01:32:08.129
Yeah.

01:32:10.466 --> 01:32:12.491
I, uh...

01:32:12.568 --> 01:32:15.002
You know, until a while ago,

01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:16.129
I could've...

01:32:16.205 --> 01:32:17.763
I could've...

01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.070
but...

01:32:21.377 --> 01:32:25.438
I just found out
I'm somebody's grandfather.

01:32:25.515 --> 01:32:30.418
I'm somebody's
father, and...

01:32:30.486 --> 01:32:32.681
and maybe...

01:32:32.789 --> 01:32:34.620
I'm somebody's friend
in the bargain.

01:32:36.426 --> 01:32:38.018
So...

01:32:39.195 --> 01:32:41.663
Yeah...

01:32:41.731 --> 01:32:44.791
you are a man among men.

01:32:44.867 --> 01:32:46.562
I know, it's not a compliment.

01:32:46.636 --> 01:32:48.570
No, this time it is.

01:32:48.638 --> 01:32:52.130
How come you're always
wrong about everything?

01:33:01.784 --> 01:33:03.342
Mmm...

01:33:13.463 --> 01:33:15.765
You are...

01:33:15.765 --> 01:33:19.064
the best...

01:33:19.135 --> 01:33:21.330
Iooking woman in Bath,
and...

01:33:21.404 --> 01:33:22.805
you're going to be

01:33:22.805 --> 01:33:25.467
the best-looking
woman in Hawaii.

01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:27.805
You're going to be fine.

01:33:28.044 --> 01:33:31.036
Thanks.

01:33:45.528 --> 01:33:50.056
We would've been
terrific together.

01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:54.493
Yeah, I think so.

01:34:33.576 --> 01:34:36.101
Don't tell me they actually
let you out of jail.

01:34:36.178 --> 01:34:38.305
Hey, what are you
guys doing here?

01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:39.348
I took Will over

01:34:39.415 --> 01:34:41.076
to the new apartment,
so he could see his room.

01:34:41.150 --> 01:34:43.380
He liked it.

01:34:43.452 --> 01:34:44.714
We were on our
way back to Mom's.

01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:45.844
I saw your truck outside.

01:34:46.088 --> 01:34:47.646
Happy New Year.

01:34:47.723 --> 01:34:51.853
It's a day or two early, but...
hey, I got faith.

01:34:52.094 --> 01:34:53.254
Thank you.

01:34:53.329 --> 01:34:55.422
To the good life.

01:34:57.833 --> 01:34:59.664
You call this the good life?

01:34:59.735 --> 01:35:01.134
Sure looks like it
from where I stand.

01:35:05.341 --> 01:35:08.139
It occurs to me
I forgot to give you

01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:09.507
your Christmas present.

01:35:09.579 --> 01:35:11.570
Call your wife.

01:35:12.782 --> 01:35:14.340
Telephone's right there.

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:15.645
You don't understand...

01:35:15.751 --> 01:35:16.718
Do it.

01:35:41.077 --> 01:35:43.238
Hi, it's me.

01:35:43.312 --> 01:35:45.371
Yeah.

01:35:45.448 --> 01:35:46.608
I... I know.

01:35:46.682 --> 01:35:51.278
Hey... don't cry.

01:35:51.354 --> 01:35:54.050
Dad... I can handle
this part myself.

01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:56.455
You'd keep my leg,
wouldn't you?

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.458
You don't need a leg...
you need a parrot.

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.699
Should we give him back his leg?

01:36:12.174 --> 01:36:15.610
You want to take it to him?

01:36:17.113 --> 01:36:18.705
It's not alive...
it ain't gonna bite you.

01:36:26.756 --> 01:36:28.724
You still got that stopwatch?

01:36:30.393 --> 01:36:31.485
Want to see if it works?

01:37:05.561 --> 01:37:06.493
Come on.

01:37:06.562 --> 01:37:08.621
You think...?

01:37:32.588 --> 01:37:34.385
Thank you.

01:37:46.135 --> 01:37:50.231
Will... your mom wants
to talk to you.

01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:53.072
Mom?

01:37:59.381 --> 01:38:00.313
Dick.

01:38:00.382 --> 01:38:02.475
You know,
I think I'm getting

01:38:02.551 --> 01:38:04.178
too old for this job.

01:38:04.253 --> 01:38:05.254
How come?

01:38:05.254 --> 01:38:08.257
You're starting
to look good to me.

01:38:08.257 --> 01:38:11.556
I do that...
I grow on people.

01:38:16.465 --> 01:38:19.662
Sommelier, encore,
s'il vous plaît.

01:38:23.606 --> 01:38:26.734
Listen, I need a favor.

01:38:26.809 --> 01:38:30.301
I'm serious about this.

01:38:30.379 --> 01:38:32.108
It's your landlady.

01:38:32.181 --> 01:38:34.672
She's done something for you.

01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:35.808
What?

01:38:35.885 --> 01:38:40.322
You own the house
on Bowdin again.

01:38:40.389 --> 01:38:43.688
She paid the back taxes.

01:38:47.329 --> 01:38:48.387
And you let her?

01:38:48.464 --> 01:38:49.624
I encouraged her.

01:38:49.698 --> 01:38:51.461
Fine! She paid the taxes;
she owns it.

01:38:51.534 --> 01:38:54.526
I told you I didn't want
anything to do with that place.

01:38:54.603 --> 01:38:56.468
This isn't about
what you want.

01:38:56.539 --> 01:38:58.530
I don't give a damn
what you want.

01:38:58.607 --> 01:39:01.235
This is about need.

01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:05.644
Clive Jr.'s gone;
he's not coming back.

01:39:07.082 --> 01:39:09.744
Now, this is the favor:

01:39:09.819 --> 01:39:13.756
When she tells you...

01:39:13.756 --> 01:39:15.485
be grateful.

01:39:15.558 --> 01:39:18.459
Make her feel good.

01:39:18.527 --> 01:39:22.258
Is that too much to ask?

01:39:22.331 --> 01:39:27.792
Sully, either you do this,
or... I'm off of you for life.

01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:31.203
I mean it.

01:39:31.273 --> 01:39:32.638
Dad?

01:39:32.741 --> 01:39:34.675
Dad.

01:39:35.911 --> 01:39:37.435
Yeah?

01:39:37.513 --> 01:39:41.210
Could you and Rub spare me
for a couple days?

01:39:41.283 --> 01:39:43.717
Well, Rub sure could.

01:39:43.819 --> 01:39:45.582
How 'bout you?

01:39:45.654 --> 01:39:47.622
Okay.

01:39:51.126 --> 01:39:55.119
Uh... could be more
than a couple days.

01:39:55.197 --> 01:39:56.630
Well, you run into problems,

01:39:56.699 --> 01:39:58.826
just think what I would do,
and then...

01:39:58.901 --> 01:40:00.300
Do the opposite.

01:40:00.369 --> 01:40:01.859
I'll remember that.

01:40:01.937 --> 01:40:05.566
Oh. Almost forgot.

01:40:05.641 --> 01:40:07.165
What's that?

01:40:07.243 --> 01:40:09.945
Here.
What do you think it is?

01:40:09.945 --> 01:40:12.436
It's a trifecta ticket.

01:40:18.354 --> 01:40:20.845
The trifecta ticket?

01:40:20.923 --> 01:40:23.221
The one that hit?

01:40:27.363 --> 01:40:28.489
How much?

01:40:28.564 --> 01:40:30.930
5,800 bucks.

01:40:31.166 --> 01:40:32.633
And you bet it?

01:40:32.701 --> 01:40:35.363
You told me to, remember?

01:40:35.437 --> 01:40:37.166
Right before you went to jail.

01:40:40.643 --> 01:40:41.803
Oh, wow.

01:40:41.877 --> 01:40:43.344
How about that?

01:40:43.412 --> 01:40:47.576
Intelligence, hard work
and good looks finally pay off.

01:40:47.650 --> 01:40:50.312
And to think
we were here to see it.

01:40:51.720 --> 01:40:54.154
Wow.

01:42:27.282 --> 01:42:30.342
Hey, try anything
and you'll regret it!

01:42:41.563 --> 01:42:45.761
Oh, no... not a chance.

01:43:17.933 --> 01:43:19.298
Oh...!

01:43:20.836 --> 01:43:22.531
Who are you?

01:43:31.513 --> 01:43:35.779
I fixed the railing
on the porch.

01:43:38.954 --> 01:43:41.479
Can I come in
and pull my boots off?

01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:43.717
Of course, Donald.

01:43:47.563 --> 01:43:51.499
Looks like you're the only one
in town who'll have me.

01:43:51.633 --> 01:43:55.296
I hope you didn't... rent my
room out from underneath me.

01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:57.736
Not yet.

01:43:57.806 --> 01:44:00.900
By the way,
what's your policy on pets?

01:44:03.712 --> 01:44:04.872
I'm not sure.

01:44:04.947 --> 01:44:09.247
Well... we'll come
up with something.

01:44:12.554 --> 01:44:13.919
I'm going to have a cup of tea.

01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:14.883
Would you like one?

01:44:14.957 --> 01:44:17.824
No. Not now, not ever.

01:44:22.764 --> 01:44:24.823
I'm sorry about Clive Jr.

01:44:26.535 --> 01:44:29.265
Thank you, Donald.

01:44:29.338 --> 01:44:32.608
I keep thinking
I failed him in some way.

01:44:32.608 --> 01:44:34.508
At least you raised him.

01:44:34.610 --> 01:44:38.740
That's more than I can say.

01:44:38.814 --> 01:44:42.841
There's a rumor around town
that you did a good deed.

01:44:42.918 --> 01:44:46.786
You stuck your nose
where it didn't belong.

01:44:46.855 --> 01:44:49.824
I know it.

01:44:49.892 --> 01:44:52.360
I'm an old woman, though;
I'm entitled.

01:44:59.368 --> 01:45:01.233
Well, you're forgiven.

01:45:01.303 --> 01:45:03.863
Thank you.

01:45:05.541 --> 01:45:08.738
Are you sure I can't interest
you in a cup of tea?

01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:11.870
No, and how many times
do I have to tell you?

01:45:11.947 --> 01:45:14.279
Other people change
their minds occasionally.

01:45:14.349 --> 01:45:17.716
I keep thinking you might.

01:45:17.786 --> 01:45:20.516
You do?

01:45:22.925 --> 01:45:25.450
Huh.

01:45:50.352 --> 01:45:53.219
You may as well come in, too.
