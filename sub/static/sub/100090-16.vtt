WEBVTT

00:05.179 --> 00:07.877
- You feeling any lingering
effects from the shooting?

00:07.920 --> 00:10.140
- Now when I put my shirt on,
I put my left arm in first.

00:10.184 --> 00:12.055
Other than that, feels good.

00:12.099 --> 00:14.666
- How's the mobility?
Any stiffness?

00:14.710 --> 00:18.670
- Nothing that would prevent me
from doing my job.

00:18.714 --> 00:23.110
- You feeling any lingering
psychological effects?

00:23.153 --> 00:24.328
- No.

00:24.372 --> 00:26.200
- Anxiety,
mood swings, irritability.

00:26.243 --> 00:27.679
These would all be
perfectly normal

00:27.723 --> 00:30.334
responses six weeks later.

00:30.378 --> 00:31.857
- Honestly, Doc, this visit's
starting to make me

00:31.901 --> 00:34.077
feel a little irritable.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.123
- It's just protocol,
Detective.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.167
You should be used to it.

00:37.211 --> 00:39.387
I read your
Injured on Duty record.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.215
You've had a hell of a run.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.652
Six broken fingers,
one broken wrist,

00:43.695 --> 00:45.001
five broken ribs,

00:45.045 --> 00:47.699
lacerated skull,
over a hundred stitches.

00:47.743 --> 00:50.180
And it's not the first time
you've been shot.

00:50.224 --> 00:54.445
Chicago Med should give you
frequent flyer miles.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.273
- Uh, look, Doc, I don't know
what you want me to say.

00:56.317 --> 00:58.406
I told you, feel strong,
and I feel clear.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.190
I just hope you sign
whatever it is you gotta sign

01:00.234 --> 01:02.149
so I can go back to work.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.112
- What'd the doctor say?
You good to go?

01:09.156 --> 01:10.418
- Good to go.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.115
He said avoid bullets.
Lead's bad for your health.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.074
I just talked to Voight.

01:14.117 --> 01:16.076
He wants us partnered up again.

01:16.119 --> 01:17.381
- Oh, so you can
keep an eye on me?

01:17.425 --> 01:19.079
- 'Cause we're good together,
and I asked him.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.124
You all right with that?

01:21.168 --> 01:22.560
- I am.

01:22.604 --> 01:24.910
- Units on the citywide.
2533 South Whipple.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.999
Armed robbery in progress.
Pay-Day Advantage.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.219
- That's right up Cermak.
Let's take the stairs.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.830
- 5021 George,
we're rolling on it.

01:36.487 --> 01:38.228
There's a silent alarm.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.578
- 5021 Henry on the scene.
Call's bona fide.

01:40.622 --> 01:44.147
- Copy that, 5021 Henry.
Backup en route.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.108
- I got this.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.892
Go.
- All right.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.111
- Hey, shut up!
Come on.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.199
- Police!
Don't move!

01:52.242 --> 01:53.287
- Just shut up!

01:57.682 --> 01:59.206
- 10-1, 10-1.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.598
I got shots fired.
Shots fired at the police.

02:00.642 --> 02:02.818
Send me some cars.
I got people everywhere.

02:02.861 --> 02:03.906
Stay down!
Get down!

02:13.045 --> 02:14.134
I got two masked offenders

02:14.177 --> 02:15.352
fleeing northbound
in a gray van.

02:15.396 --> 02:16.571
- Copy that.

02:16.614 --> 02:17.920
- Oh, my God.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.530
- 5021 George, roll an ambo.
Got a civilian hit.

02:19.574 --> 02:20.792
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.142
- What's your name, man?
What's your name?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.360
What's your name?
- Carl.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.753
- Carl, stay with me.

02:24.796 --> 02:25.884
Stay with me.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.374
- Thank you.

02:37.418 --> 02:40.116
- Hold on.
I gotta talk to you for a sec.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.684
- Oh.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.033
Can't believe this.
It's horrible.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.339
- Yeah, I know.

02:45.382 --> 02:46.601
We're just trying
to piece together

02:46.644 --> 02:47.950
everything that happened.

02:47.993 --> 02:48.907
Can you tell me your name?

02:48.951 --> 02:50.344
- It's Michelle.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.696
Taylor.
Michelle Taylor.

02:54.739 --> 02:55.958
- Okay.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.787
Where were you
when the robbery went down?

02:58.830 --> 03:02.878
- I was in the store
down the street, shopping.

03:02.921 --> 03:06.403
- Michelle, do you remember
seeing anyone or anything

03:06.447 --> 03:08.100
that was suspicious
before the robbery?

03:08.144 --> 03:09.493
- No.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.756
I was inside the store,

03:11.800 --> 03:15.760
and when I came out,
I heard the shooting.

03:15.804 --> 03:19.634
And I was so scared,
I hid behind a car.

03:19.677 --> 03:22.680
And then I saw
that man get shot.

03:24.247 --> 03:27.207
So I went to go help him.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.730
- A good Samaritan.

03:30.862 --> 03:33.256
- Well, if you don't need
anything else,

03:33.300 --> 03:35.519
I have to go pick up
my daughter from school.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.781
- Just gotta take down
your information

03:36.825 --> 03:38.174
in case I have
any more questions.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.436
- Yeah.

03:41.351 --> 03:43.571
- All right,
what we got was three guys.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.573
Two of them go inside
to hit the place.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.401
Another one's waiting in a van

03:47.444 --> 03:49.533
down the street
as a getaway driver.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.187
- They're experienced
and motivated.

03:51.231 --> 03:54.277
- Yeah, they definitely had
no problem pulling the trigger.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.974
- Well, we get a look
at these guys?

03:56.018 --> 03:57.759
- No, they were wearing masks,
and when the shooting started,

03:57.802 --> 03:59.064
a bystander got hit,

03:59.108 --> 04:01.458
and he was just a guy
on his way home from work.

04:01.502 --> 04:02.894
- Clerk said the offenders
were both male and white.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.418
She could see their necks
under the mask.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.289
She saw them pass
the door strip.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.204
She said that one was 6'0",
and one was 6'4".

04:08.248 --> 04:10.206
- And the only physical
evidence inside the store

04:10.250 --> 04:12.730
are these zip-ties, which were
used to restrain the victims.

04:12.774 --> 04:15.080
- Patrol found the silver
van parked about a mile

04:15.124 --> 04:17.996
down the road in an abandoned
parking lot off Division.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.434
It's been torched.
It's actually still on fire.

04:20.477 --> 04:22.349
Reported stolen
about a week ago.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.480
- So that's where
they made the switch.

04:23.524 --> 04:24.655
No prints, no DNA?

04:24.699 --> 04:25.917
No.
There's no pictures either.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.528
They spray-painted
all the surveillance cameras

04:27.571 --> 04:29.834
as soon as they walked
in the store.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.662
- Well, the fact they knew
where the cameras were

04:31.706 --> 04:33.577
suggests they cased the place.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.275
So let's keep
talking to witnesses,

04:35.318 --> 04:37.625
but pull all the surveillance
over the last couple of months.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.192
These guys did their homework.
Maybe we catch them studying.

04:40.236 --> 04:41.411
- Copy that.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.285
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.637
- What's this?
- Um...

04:49.680 --> 04:52.683
I got you hockey tickets.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.729
- What?

04:54.772 --> 04:56.861
- It's...

04:56.905 --> 04:58.559
I'm...

05:00.952 --> 05:03.955
From when I was pregnant
to when I wasn't,

05:03.999 --> 05:06.001
you've been there for me,
and I appreciate it.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.876
I feel like you've been with me
this whole way.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.013
It's weird I got you tickets.

05:18.056 --> 05:21.016
- Thank you.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.018
- Yeah.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.676
- I'm still with you.

05:30.895 --> 05:33.028
- All right,
bring me up to speed.

05:33.071 --> 05:36.379
- The same crew has hit
two other check-cashing places

05:36.423 --> 05:38.163
in the last couple weeks,
so that makes three.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.382
It's definitely a pattern.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.731
- They're using
gloves and masks.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.124
Same MO,
and they're stealing a car

05:42.167 --> 05:43.255
every time
to cover their tracks.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.779
- Sarge, I pulled
the rest of the eyes

05:44.822 --> 05:45.910
on the block like you said.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.434
- And?

05:47.477 --> 05:48.783
- And as far as we can tell,
they had a lookout.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.393
That might be our way in.

05:50.437 --> 05:51.960
- Thought it was
a three-man crew.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.005
- Same thing we thought,
but this makes four.

05:54.049 --> 05:56.965
So this is the drug store
on the north end of the corner

05:57.008 --> 05:58.662
five minutes
before the robbery.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.143
The kid on the bike,
that's our lookout.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.275
- Look, he's watching
that patrol car down the block.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.321
Soon as that
patrol car leaves...

06:05.365 --> 06:07.105
- He calls it in.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.846
- And there go the bad guys.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.458
And there's the minivan
our shooters escaped in.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.155
- All right,
so how do we get the kid?

06:13.198 --> 06:14.635
- Well, we ran facial rec.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.506
Jamal Meeky.
20.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.203
He's got one prior
for breaking and entering.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.944
Spent a year in juvie.

06:19.988 --> 06:21.337
- Good.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.253
Let's roll him up.

06:35.090 --> 06:37.048
- Come on, man.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.575
- We got a peeker.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.537
Hey!
Hey!

06:47.581 --> 06:48.582
- He's out the back!

06:48.625 --> 06:50.845
- Copy that.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.281
- I'll take the next block.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.414
- Chicago PD!

06:58.287 --> 06:59.462
- Hands up.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.856
- Shut the car off.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.597
Offender's in custody.
- Copy that.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.990
- Jamal Meeky,
you're under arrest.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.472
- I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.821
That is not my game.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.997
- Jamal, we got footage,
so we know you were there.

07:13.041 --> 07:14.564
- My neighborhood?

07:14.608 --> 07:15.696
Being in the vicinity
of a crime

07:15.739 --> 07:16.740
isn't all that unusual.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.002
- You hid while
the cops were there.

07:18.046 --> 07:21.310
Soon as the cops left,
you made a phone call.

07:21.353 --> 07:22.529
All right,
that's a bit of a tell.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.574
Who'd you make the call to?

07:24.618 --> 07:26.446
- I don't remember.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.883
- Who'd you call?

07:33.801 --> 07:36.107
- I was calling my crew.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.587
Telling them to stay inside,
not to come out

07:37.631 --> 07:38.632
while the police
was on the block.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.155
- That's a bad time
to sell drugs.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.026
- Your words, not mine.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.683
I had nothing to do
with what went down.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.250
I swear on my mama.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.599
- Okay, if that's how you want
to play it, what's he got?

07:49.643 --> 07:51.471
46 hours to refresh his memory?

07:51.514 --> 07:53.124
- 46 hours--
that's plenty of time for me

07:53.168 --> 07:54.952
to wipe that stupid smirk
off your face.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.519
Here's what you don't seem
to understand.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.695
These people,
they shot at cops.

07:58.739 --> 08:01.437
They shot at our friends,
so this right here

08:01.481 --> 08:02.743
is the easiest
you're gonna have it.

08:02.786 --> 08:05.006
We're not gonna get nicer
as time goes on.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.137
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

08:06.181 --> 08:07.530
- Okay, okay.
- Do you get it now?

08:07.574 --> 08:09.227
- Okay, yeah,
maybe I did see somebody.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.185
- Mm-hmm.
- A white lady.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.229
Across the street.

08:11.273 --> 08:12.448
I thought
she might be tweaking.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.103
She was pacing back and forth.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.757
- What'd she look like?

08:16.800 --> 08:19.107
- Red jacket, brown hair.

08:19.150 --> 08:22.110
Stuck out like a sore,
white thumb.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.241
- Like a lookout?

08:23.285 --> 08:25.069
- She was on the lookout
for something.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.810
That's for sure.

08:29.987 --> 08:31.728
- Hey.
Jamal's story seems credible.

08:31.772 --> 08:32.990
We ran his phone records.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.905
The only calls Jamal made
before the heist

08:34.949 --> 08:36.559
were to his associates,
which are a couple of kids

08:36.603 --> 08:38.039
with minor drug priors.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.868
- Okay, so the woman who Jamal
thought was suspicious,

08:40.911 --> 08:42.652
Michelle Taylor, I interviewed
her at the crime scene.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.045
- The good Samaritan.

08:44.088 --> 08:46.177
- The good Samaritan
who gave me a bogus number.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.701
And her story
does not jibe with Jamal's.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.137
She said she's inside
during the robbery.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.661
He says no,
she's outside the whole time.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.924
- All right,
so now she's a suspect.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.535
Find her.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.626
- But you never want to put
carnations with the irises.

08:59.669 --> 09:01.149
It kind of ruins the effect.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.369
- Excuse me.
Maybe you could help me?

09:10.201 --> 09:11.855
- Tina, go back to the office
and start your homework.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.162
- Mommy.
- Do what I tell you.

09:18.253 --> 09:22.170
- So you do have a daughter.
That part's true, anyway.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.041
- How did you find me?

09:24.085 --> 09:25.565
- A Prius registered
to this florist

09:25.608 --> 09:27.218
was parked outside the robbery.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.350
You want to start over?

09:28.393 --> 09:30.178
You want to tell me
your real name?

09:31.658 --> 09:32.963
- Michelle.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.053
Michelle Sullivan.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.881
- Why'd you give me
false information?

09:37.925 --> 09:39.274
- I'm sorry,
I didn't want to get involved

09:39.317 --> 09:41.015
with the police.

09:41.058 --> 09:43.017
- I got a witness says that you
were going from store to store,

09:43.060 --> 09:44.714
acting strangely
during the robbery.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.890
You said you're inside

09:46.934 --> 09:48.718
and you're shopping
when you heard the gunshots.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.111
So is that lie number two?

09:50.154 --> 09:53.288
- No, I-I was confused.
There was so much going on.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.072
I didn't...

09:57.771 --> 09:59.686
- Are you involved
with the robbery?

10:13.525 --> 10:14.614
If you're in some
kind of trouble,

10:14.657 --> 10:16.137
you know I can help you.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.228
- No, you can't.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.666
- Hi, baby.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.363
- Hi.
- Mwah.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.408
Where's Tina?

10:26.451 --> 10:28.236
- She's in the back
doing homework.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.284
- You okay?

10:33.328 --> 10:36.636
- Oh, yeah, I'm just, um,
helping a customer.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.641
- Who you getting flowers for?

10:41.684 --> 10:43.120
- My, uh, my girlfriend.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.948
- Bro,
carnations are for parades.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.472
If I were you,
I'd go red roses.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.780
- Yeah, but everybody
goes red roses.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.869
- Because it works.
It's a classic.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.131
With a little Baby's Breath.
Right, baby?

10:54.175 --> 10:55.437
- Yeah.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.747
- Okay, sure.
Yeah, I'll go red roses.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.705
- I'll wrap them up.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.925
- She's gonna love them.
- All right, thanks.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.626
- All right.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.378
- What a guy.

11:23.421 --> 11:26.686
- Her husband came in.
She told him I was a customer.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.252
Something didn't feel right.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.690
- Yeah, well,
I took a picture of them,

11:30.733 --> 11:31.691
ran it through the system.

11:31.734 --> 11:32.866
Lit up the screen.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.694
Turns out our good Samaritan
is married

11:34.737 --> 11:37.174
to a convicted felon.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.742
- Let me guess, armed robbery.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.875
- Told you
we were good together.

11:49.752 --> 11:52.015
- Michelle Taylor is actually
Michelle Sullivan,

11:52.059 --> 11:53.364
who is married
to Shane Sullivan.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.801
30 years old,
lived his whole life

11:54.844 --> 11:56.237
in Bridgeport except
for three years that he served

11:56.280 --> 11:58.369
in Pontiac Prison
for an armed robbery.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.720
Was released six months ago.
Works in construction.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.810
- We talked to the guys
on robbery who worked the case.

12:03.853 --> 12:06.029
It was a three-man crew
doing home invasions.

12:06.073 --> 12:07.117
They arrested Shane,
tried to get him

12:07.161 --> 12:08.771
to flip on the others.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.773
He wouldn't do it.
He's old-school loyal.

12:10.817 --> 12:11.948
He ate the whole charge.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.820
- All right,
any leads on the new crew?

12:13.863 --> 12:16.431
- Shane is 6'4", which matches
the clerk's description.

12:16.474 --> 12:17.737
- We ran Shane's phone records.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.260
The only person he called
in the last two days

12:19.303 --> 12:21.044
is his wife Michelle,
which means this new crew

12:21.088 --> 12:22.567
is communicating with burners.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.047
- And Michelle
is the good Samaritan.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.657
We get anything on her yet?

12:25.701 --> 12:27.877
- Michelle Sullivan,
she's also 30 years old.

12:27.921 --> 12:28.965
Born and raised in Bridgeport.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.401
She's got zero
criminal history.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.794
She's got
an eight-year-old daughter,

12:31.838 --> 12:33.883
and she works part-time
as a florist.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.885
- And part-time lookout
for her husband's robbery crew.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.148
- Well, that's the theory.
We don't have the evidence.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.715
- I mean,
it wasn't a coincidence

12:39.759 --> 12:41.325
that she was at
a check-cashing store.

12:41.369 --> 12:45.155
- Yeah, I hear all that,
but based on her behavior,

12:45.199 --> 12:46.896
she didn't give me up
as a cop to her husband,

12:46.940 --> 12:49.290
so that suggests to me
that she's in trouble with him.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.595
I think she's scared.

12:50.639 --> 12:53.076
So we gotta cultivate her,
win her trust.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.512
- I'm with Jay.

12:54.556 --> 12:55.600
If we push her and she
doesn't want to play ball,

12:55.644 --> 12:57.254
we're tipping our hand
to Shane.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.082
- Right, and we know he's not
gonna cooperate with the cops.

12:59.126 --> 13:02.085
If we push him, then he's just
gonna shut down the whole crew.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.131
They're gonna disappear
in the wind.

13:04.174 --> 13:05.785
- Okay, so get out
your cameras.

13:05.828 --> 13:08.091
Let's follow Shane.
Get a tracker on his car.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.050
And dig into his associates.

13:10.093 --> 13:11.399
Let's ID this crew,

13:11.442 --> 13:13.183
get them in pocket
before they hit again.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.229
- Copy that.

13:21.713 --> 13:22.932
- Hey.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.891
- All right, saddle up.
Our boy's coming out.

13:24.934 --> 13:25.935
- No, don't worry about it.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.328
Go back inside.

13:31.854 --> 13:35.684
Target is getting into a gray,
four-door BMW.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.122
- I don't think
they could afford that BMW

13:39.166 --> 13:41.211
on a part-time florist salary.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.868
- He's headed south,
down Princeton toward 33rd.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.436
- Copy. Standing by on 31
to pick him up.

13:52.875 --> 13:55.269
- We've got eyes on Shane
outside the Red Hots on 35th.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.532
Looks like he's meeting
with two other guys.

13:57.575 --> 13:58.881
- Copy that.
Standing by.

14:04.495 --> 14:08.021
- His name is Mike Brady.
He's notorious in Bridgeport.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.850
Been a person of interest
in over a dozen heists.

14:10.893 --> 14:13.896
They're all open cases.
None of them have been cleared.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.333
Brady's so tough to bust
'cause guy only feeds

14:16.377 --> 14:18.509
when he's hungry,
so the window of opportunity

14:18.553 --> 14:20.250
to grab this guy is very slim.

14:20.294 --> 14:23.166
- A guy that works
for him is no joke.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.212
Eric Walsh, age 40.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.300
He's another Bridgeport boy.

14:27.823 --> 14:30.521
- He's basically got
a timeshare at the county jail.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.306
He just did six months
for possession

14:32.349 --> 14:33.916
of an illegal firearm.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.788
- Well, the good news is,
this crew is definitely active.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.182
But meeting in a public place
is not a crime.

14:39.226 --> 14:40.880
So we need an act
of furtherance

14:40.923 --> 14:44.274
to catch this crew solid
so we can make a case.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.189
- I just talked to a nurse
at Chicago Med.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.148
Carl Hoffman,
the guy who was shot

14:48.191 --> 14:50.890
during the cash store robbery,
just died.

14:50.933 --> 14:53.370
He left behind three kids.

14:57.113 --> 15:00.421
- So our armed robbery
just graduated to homicide.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.727
It's time to take
the gloves off.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.431
- Michelle.

15:10.474 --> 15:13.042
These are from
the check-cashing robbery

15:13.086 --> 15:14.348
the other day.

15:14.391 --> 15:17.177
We are more than certain
that one of these men

15:17.220 --> 15:19.701
is Shane Sullivan,
your husband.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.661
- No, that's not possible.

15:23.705 --> 15:26.751
- He just did a three-year
stint for armed robbery.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.450
So it's definitely in the realm
of possibility.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.060
- You were there to help him.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.627
- No, that's not true.

15:32.670 --> 15:33.845
- Come on, Michelle,
you've been lying to us

15:33.889 --> 15:35.499
from the get-go.
What were you doing there?

15:35.543 --> 15:37.719
Why were you on the street?
You acting as a lookout?

15:37.762 --> 15:39.286
- No, I already told you.
I was shopping.

15:39.329 --> 15:40.678
- We checked
the security footage.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.942
You weren't in that store.
You want to try again?

15:47.990 --> 15:51.602
- Take a look at this picture.
That's Carl Hoffman.

15:51.646 --> 15:55.084
This is the guy that you
were trying to help save.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.173
He is now dead.

15:57.217 --> 16:00.524
That officially puts you
on the hook for felony murder.

16:03.005 --> 16:06.617
- Look, we can still help you.
You have no priors.

16:06.661 --> 16:09.142
If you cooperate,
you can live a life,

16:09.185 --> 16:11.883
see your daughter
go to college.

16:11.927 --> 16:15.017
If not,
you're looking at 15 years.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.499
- If you know my husband
did this robbery,

16:18.542 --> 16:21.458
how come you're talking to me?

16:21.502 --> 16:23.373
- Because we don't have
any evidence against him,

16:23.417 --> 16:25.419
just you.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.247
- But I didn't do anything.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.688
And I really need to get home.

16:33.731 --> 16:36.604
My daughter is getting
dropped off from a playdate.

16:36.647 --> 16:41.174
- Michelle, you don't get it.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.002
You're not going home.

16:46.353 --> 16:49.182
You're not going home
for a long time.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.841
Not unless you help us.

17:00.497 --> 17:02.717
- Yeah, I'd like to make
a phone call.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.634
But I'm not gonna help you.

17:21.779 --> 17:25.000
- So far, nothing.
She's not cooperating.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.176
- I don't understand.
Why are we soft-shoeing here?

17:27.220 --> 17:29.961
We can put her at the scene.
We can start to build a case.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.311
- Michelle denies
seeing anything,

17:31.354 --> 17:32.703
and we can't prove
she did anything.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.009
- Right,
and if she doesn't testify,

17:34.053 --> 17:36.794
we can't even place Shane
at the scene.

17:36.838 --> 17:39.623
- Hailey, I ran those 911
in-service calls

17:39.667 --> 17:41.103
to Michelle Sullivan's address.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.278
- And?

17:42.322 --> 17:43.627
- Nothing.
Not at her current address.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.325
However, they used to rent
an apartment

17:45.368 --> 17:48.980
at 3956 South Lowe,
the other side of Bridgeport.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.156
- Thanks.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.379
Sarge, do you mind
if we tap the brakes

17:56.423 --> 17:57.641
on pressing Michelle?

17:57.685 --> 17:59.513
I may have another way
to get her to cooperate.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.429
- Two hours.

18:02.472 --> 18:03.647
- Okay.

18:06.433 --> 18:07.695
- Hi, I'm Dr. Gordon.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.000
- Uh, Detective Upton,
Detective Halstead.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.437
- How you doing?
- Here's the subpoena.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.395
Thank you for taking the time.
- I'm happy to help.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.136
- So you were the intake doctor
that helped Michelle Sullivan

18:14.180 --> 18:15.224
four years ago?

18:15.268 --> 18:16.573
The police responded
to a domestic.

18:16.617 --> 18:17.574
- That's right,
she was brought in

18:17.618 --> 18:18.923
on an ambulance.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.100
I was able to find
all the intake photos

18:21.143 --> 18:23.014
and X-rays
with my notes attached,

18:23.058 --> 18:24.973
but I can remember it clearly
without my notes.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.454
- Really?
From four years ago?

18:27.497 --> 18:29.151
- Bad ones stay with you.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.416
Patient had swelling
around the eye

18:33.460 --> 18:34.896
and six fractured ribs.

18:34.939 --> 18:37.072
She claimed it was
from a bike accident.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.030
- But it wasn't
from a bike accident.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.945
- No, and it wasn't
the first time.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.947
She'd had her ribs
broken before.

18:42.991 --> 18:46.995
These are injuries
a boxer might sustain.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.955
I asked her straight up
if her husband was hurting her.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.219
I told her
that she could be protected,

18:53.262 --> 18:54.524
and then her husband showed up.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.612
That was that.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.701
- You didn't notify the police?

18:57.745 --> 18:58.789
- Of course I did.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.096
But she refused
to press charges,

19:01.140 --> 19:04.099
and I couldn't prove that
she didn't fall off her bike.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.536
- Is there anything else
you remember?

19:06.580 --> 19:09.322
- He seemed like
such a normal guy.

19:09.365 --> 19:12.194
He even brought her flowers.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.848
- Red roses.

19:15.589 --> 19:16.851
- Thank you.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.902
- This is the one incident
we know about.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.296
But there have been
a lot of others,

19:27.340 --> 19:28.819
haven't there?

19:31.082 --> 19:35.478
Ones that you were too afraid
to report.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.828
Ones that you were ashamed of.

19:41.615 --> 19:44.400
I know how hard it is
to leave him.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.402
I really do.

19:46.446 --> 19:50.276
You built a life with him.
You love him.

19:50.319 --> 19:54.541
But deep down,
you know you gotta get out.

19:54.584 --> 19:57.892
- Shane's not perfect,
but he's not what you think.

19:59.676 --> 20:02.723
- He's a violent criminal
who beats women.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.377
What are we missing?

20:07.162 --> 20:09.599
- Shane's a good guy.
He's a great father.

20:09.643 --> 20:12.385
He's just been under
a lot of stress.

20:19.479 --> 20:23.787
- And you know what happens
when he's stressed, don't you?

20:23.831 --> 20:26.007
Or in a bad mood.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.360
Thinking he saw you
looking at another guy.

20:33.797 --> 20:36.191
Maybe you left the dishes
in the sink.

20:41.544 --> 20:46.723
This is your chance
to get out, Michelle.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.987
To get out of going to prison.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.860
To get out
of a really bad marriage.

20:57.821 --> 21:01.085
Why were you at
the check-cashing store?

21:04.915 --> 21:06.395
- What were you doing there?
Just tell us.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.485
- I am, I am.
I'm...

21:14.055 --> 21:17.058
I-I overheard Shane

21:17.101 --> 21:19.713
talking on the phone.

21:19.756 --> 21:20.888
He was saying something
about a job

21:20.931 --> 21:24.065
at the Gordon Gardens strip.

21:24.108 --> 21:27.111
I knew what that meant.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.288
So I went there to stop him.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.249
I didn't want him
to go to prison again.

21:34.293 --> 21:38.340
I-I just wanted us
to be a normal family,

21:38.384 --> 21:40.777
for Tina's sake.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.522
- Did you actually see him
in there?

21:46.566 --> 21:47.871
- No.

21:49.786 --> 21:50.918
I was looking for him,

21:50.961 --> 21:54.051
but I didn't know
where he was exactly.

21:54.095 --> 21:59.056
I just knew he was
somewhere on the strip.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.973
And then I heard the shooting.

22:13.157 --> 22:14.594
- We need Michelle
to wear a wire,

22:14.637 --> 22:16.160
get a confession.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.597
- Yeah, I think
she might do it too.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.556
We're breaking her down,
and she knows what's at stake.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.429
- I'm not so sure about that.

22:23.472 --> 22:26.040
- I've been behind those closed
doors when I was a kid,

22:26.083 --> 22:27.476
and I know what it's like.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.609
When you've been abused
like her over so many years,

22:29.652 --> 22:31.306
you give up hope.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.960
Right now, she's just
trying to stay alive,

22:33.003 --> 22:35.266
and the police are a threat
to her survival.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.312
- All right, so how
do we get her to cooperate?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.966
- Give her hope.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.360
A concrete,
tangible escape plan.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.536
She needs to see what her
new life will look like,

22:43.579 --> 22:45.146
proof that it's possible

22:45.189 --> 22:46.408
that she and her daughter
will be safe,

22:46.452 --> 22:48.323
and that he can't
come after them.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.977
- I've got my contact
at Social Services

22:50.020 --> 22:52.283
who might be able to help.

22:52.327 --> 22:53.546
- Okay.

22:58.899 --> 23:01.728
- So the city keeps
some of these apartments

23:01.771 --> 23:04.078
for special circumstances.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.428
- Is this like a safe house?

23:06.472 --> 23:09.300
- No, not technically,
but you'd be safe here.

23:09.344 --> 23:10.824
There's a 24-hour doorman
downstairs.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.652
Nobody's coming up here.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.828
- Mm.

23:14.871 --> 23:19.180
So what would I need to do?

23:19.223 --> 23:21.356
- You would need to help us.
You have to wear a wire.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.489
Get an admission
of your husband's guilt.

23:23.532 --> 23:27.188
- Then you can move in here,
transition into your new life.

23:27.231 --> 23:30.104
- Well, what about my daughter?
She'll want to see her father.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.845
- She can see her father
on visiting days

23:31.888 --> 23:35.326
at Stateville Prison.

23:35.370 --> 23:39.113
- Shane's going down
no matter what, Michelle.

23:39.156 --> 23:42.029
The question is,
are you going down with him?

23:47.513 --> 23:51.081
This is your chance to save
yourself and your daughter.

23:55.259 --> 23:59.220
- Hang on a second, honey.
I gotta take this call.

23:59.263 --> 24:01.701
Yeah?
What you got?

24:03.093 --> 24:05.879
After what happened?

24:05.922 --> 24:08.055
I trust the truck driver.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.100
- Who's the truck driver?

24:10.144 --> 24:11.493
- I don't know.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.365
- Only if he says
the store is fat.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.846
Look, I'll call you back.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.152
- Who were you talking to?

24:18.195 --> 24:19.893
- None of your business.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.851
- It is my business.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.766
You said you weren't
gonna go back to that life.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.681
- Who says I'm going back?

24:25.725 --> 24:27.553
- Where are we getting
all this money from lately?

24:27.596 --> 24:29.424
- I told you.
I'm working construction.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.079
- Shane, come on.
Just tell me the truth.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.515
- What are you talking about?

24:33.559 --> 24:34.821
- I followed you.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.345
- You followed me?
Where?

24:37.388 --> 24:41.262
- To the check-cashing store.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.699
- You were at the strip?

24:43.743 --> 24:45.005
What the hell?
What did you see?

24:45.048 --> 24:46.093
- We lost visual.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.747
- Somebody got killed.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.793
- I don't know
nothing about that.

24:50.837 --> 24:54.275
You know,
I do all of this for you,

24:54.318 --> 24:57.104
so you can be happy,
and you follow me?

24:57.147 --> 24:58.497
You ungrateful bitch!

24:58.540 --> 24:59.628
- Daddy, stop!
Please!

24:59.672 --> 25:00.890
- Get out of here!
Go to your room!

25:00.934 --> 25:02.501
- This thing's going off.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.328
- We can't go in there.
Not yet.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.547
- We're supposed to just
sit here and wait?

25:05.591 --> 25:07.114
- Yeah, we don't know
what this is.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.202
- I know what this is.

25:10.857 --> 25:12.119
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

25:13.990 --> 25:14.948
- Damn it!

25:14.991 --> 25:16.515
- There she is.

25:19.343 --> 25:20.954
- I'm so sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.566
- I love you.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.394
Please.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.396
Come on, baby.
Let's go inside.

25:30.485 --> 25:33.793
- Jay, I know this is hard.

25:33.836 --> 25:35.446
But we have to let it play out,

25:35.490 --> 25:37.405
which means
we have to keep Michelle under.

25:37.448 --> 25:38.537
- I know.

25:38.580 --> 25:39.886
It sounded like
he was hurting her.

25:39.929 --> 25:42.497
- I know.
I get it.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.500
But they were just
yelling, arguing.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.762
Which is really hard
to listen to,

25:46.806 --> 25:49.548
and even harder to know
when to intervene.

25:51.593 --> 25:52.681
But we're cops,

25:52.725 --> 25:54.161
so we also have to think
about the family

25:54.204 --> 25:57.599
of the guy who got murdered.

25:57.643 --> 26:00.559
And that is the person
responsible for it.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.838
- The wire didn't
get us a confession,

26:18.881 --> 26:19.621
but it did
introduce us to a possible

26:19.665 --> 26:20.622
fourth member of the team.

26:20.666 --> 26:21.884
- Okay.
- Truck driver.

26:21.928 --> 26:22.929
- Someone who knows
when the stores are fat.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.191
- That's right,
and the one thing

26:24.234 --> 26:25.888
that all these cash stores
that got robbed

26:25.932 --> 26:28.238
have in common are deliveries
from Conserva Armored Security.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.762
- We called Conserva.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.241
They sent us over a list
of all the drivers

26:31.285 --> 26:33.679
that did cash deliveries
on the days of the robberies.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.550
There's only one driver

26:35.594 --> 26:36.769
who delivered
to all of the stores

26:36.812 --> 26:38.422
right before they were hit.

26:38.466 --> 26:40.120
This guy, John Franklin.
He's age 35.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.338
He's got zero priors.

26:41.382 --> 26:44.472
Lives at 324 Maple Avenue
in Canaryville.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.082
- Take him.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.434
John, we got evidence
you've been passing

26:50.478 --> 26:54.351
inside information about your
cash drops to a robbery group.

26:54.395 --> 26:57.006
I mean, you know that's why
you're here, right?

26:57.050 --> 26:59.356
- It wasn't supposed to happen
the way that it did.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.228
- Mm-hmm.

27:01.271 --> 27:02.533
Everybody who sits
in that chair

27:02.577 --> 27:04.535
says the exact same thing.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.755
- Let's start with the names
of everybody in the robbery.

27:06.799 --> 27:07.974
- I don't know their names.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.933
- Well, that's not
a very good start, John.

27:10.977 --> 27:13.153
Okay, how about this?
Look at this.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.328
You recognize
any of these guys?

27:14.371 --> 27:15.634
- I didn't even meet them.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.679
- John.

27:17.723 --> 27:18.593
Who are you working with?

27:18.637 --> 27:19.812
- I don't know.

27:19.855 --> 27:22.989
Everything was done
by the phone.

27:23.032 --> 27:26.166
About a month ago,
I got a package in the mail.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.342
Inside the package
was a cell phone and a note,

27:28.385 --> 27:30.692
and the note said
that they knew that I delivered

27:30.736 --> 27:32.302
money for check-cashing stores.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.609
They said all I gotta do
is just call the number

27:34.653 --> 27:35.828
before I make a big drop,

27:35.871 --> 27:38.352
and they'd kick me back
2 grand.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.484
- All right, how many times?

27:41.921 --> 27:43.923
- Three.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.707
- John...

27:47.230 --> 27:50.973
I don't understand.
I mean, you got no priors.

27:51.017 --> 27:52.540
You seem like a good citizen.

27:52.583 --> 27:56.936
So why would you risk all
of that for a measly 6 grand?

27:56.979 --> 28:01.201
- My mom's sick.
Cancer.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.420
And the medicine's
crazy expensive,

28:03.464 --> 28:04.770
and insurance companies,

28:04.813 --> 28:07.207
they're not paying
for everything that she needs.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.862
They even took up a special
collection for her at church,

28:09.905 --> 28:12.038
and it didn't even make a dent.

28:13.430 --> 28:17.043
- Hold on a second.
What church do you go to?

28:17.086 --> 28:18.740
- St. Mark's.

28:21.047 --> 28:23.049
- That son of a bitch Brady

28:23.092 --> 28:25.965
goes to the same church
as Franklin.

28:26.008 --> 28:29.055
Knew the kid was struggling
to pay his mom's medical bills,

28:29.098 --> 28:31.057
so he tempts him with a way
to make some extra cash.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.623
- The good news is,
Franklin confessed

28:32.667 --> 28:35.148
to being the inside man
handing off info on cash drops.

28:35.191 --> 28:37.803
The bad news is,
guy's a cutout.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.153
I mean, he can't connect us
to the crew.

28:40.196 --> 28:44.244
- Well, that's Brady's MO.
Outsiders are kept outside.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.724
- Hold on a sec.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.813
They don't know
that we arrested Franklin,

28:47.856 --> 28:49.597
Brady and the crew.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.120
They think he's still in play.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.905
- Boss, Franklin already
sent that text saying

28:52.948 --> 28:54.297
he was driving
a fat truck tomorrow.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.212
- Yeah, Sarge, this heist
can still go down.

28:56.256 --> 28:59.825
- Yeah, so let's keep
this heist in motion.

28:59.868 --> 29:02.610
Pull Franklin out of lockup.
Get him back into play.

29:02.653 --> 29:04.481
Jay, you and Hailey
monitor Shane.

29:04.525 --> 29:08.877
Let's lay a trap,
catch this crew in the act.

29:13.839 --> 29:16.276
Worm is on the hook.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.715
- We're in pocket.
You just say the word, boss.

29:22.282 --> 29:24.153
- I'm in position.

29:44.695 --> 29:46.088
- Brady just arrived.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.437
He's alone.

29:47.481 --> 29:49.483
- We got eyes, Sarge.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.748
- Who just called you?

29:53.792 --> 29:54.967
- I'm going out
to meet a friend.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.143
- Which friend?
- None of your business.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.884
I've gotta go.
Have you seen my keys?

29:58.927 --> 30:00.407
- We got eyes on Shane.

30:00.450 --> 30:02.365
He hasn't left yet.

30:05.455 --> 30:06.892
- Driver just completed
his drop.

30:06.935 --> 30:08.284
He's leaving now.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.593
- Sarge, what's he doing?

30:12.636 --> 30:14.900
- He's casing the place.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.211
- What are you doing?
Get out of my way.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.909
- I just--I don't want you
to get in trouble.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.127
We can do this
a different way.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.302
- She's changing her mind.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.826
She doesn't want him
to do the robbery.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.697
- Where are my keys?

30:29.740 --> 30:31.568
- Please, don't go.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.005
- Did you take my keys?

30:33.048 --> 30:34.441
- Sarge, we have a situation.

30:34.484 --> 30:37.444
Looks like Michelle flipped.
She took Shane's keys.

30:37.487 --> 30:40.534
- I got Brady over here
right now waiting for him.

30:40.577 --> 30:42.014
- Yeah, well,
he hasn't left the house yet.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.102
She won't let him go.

30:43.145 --> 30:44.103
- My keys were on the table.

30:44.146 --> 30:45.844
Did you take my keys?

30:45.887 --> 30:47.497
- Shane, please, just listen--
- Where are my keys, Michelle?

30:47.541 --> 30:49.325
- I don't know!
- I want my keys!

30:49.369 --> 30:50.587
- That's not just arguing.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.285
- Jay, we don't know
what this is yet.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.416
Let it play.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.549
- Shane, stop it!

30:55.592 --> 30:57.464
- I'm going in.
- Stop!

30:57.507 --> 30:58.421
Stop!

30:58.465 --> 31:00.380
Stop it!

31:09.693 --> 31:11.043
What are you doing here?

31:11.086 --> 31:13.349
- We got a call
of a domestic disturbance.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.047
- What? From who?
Nobody here called.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.178
- What the hell is going on?

31:16.222 --> 31:18.789
- Chicago PD.
Stay where you are.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.966
- You're a cop?
This guy's a cop?

31:21.009 --> 31:22.402
- Just keep your hands
where I can see them.

31:22.445 --> 31:24.186
- There were sounds of violence
coming from the house.

31:24.230 --> 31:26.188
- I got frustrated
and I broke a vase.

31:26.232 --> 31:28.582
Is that against the law?
I never touched her.

31:28.625 --> 31:29.931
- Is that true?

31:29.975 --> 31:31.759
- We were having a argument.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.588
- Did he physically hurt you?

31:38.157 --> 31:40.202
- He grabbed my hand.
- Get up against the wall.

31:40.246 --> 31:42.248
- You were holding my keys!
- Stand up against the wall.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.640
Put your hands
behind your back.

31:43.684 --> 31:46.078
Don't move.
You're under arrest.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.993
- For what?
For arguing with my wife?

31:48.036 --> 31:49.255
- No, for domestic assault.

31:49.298 --> 31:52.301
- Michelle, tell him.
Tell him it's not true.

31:52.345 --> 31:53.607
Tell him!

32:07.186 --> 32:08.622
- We just arrested Shane.

32:08.665 --> 32:11.103
He's not coming.

32:11.146 --> 32:14.019
- Stand down.
The deal's blown.

32:21.548 --> 32:22.766
- Huh.

32:25.334 --> 32:26.988
- Sarge.
- Uh-huh.

32:28.903 --> 32:30.470
- I know we would've had him
on the murder,

32:30.513 --> 32:32.385
but I couldn't just sit there.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.562
- So what did happen?

32:37.738 --> 32:40.828
- You talk about being
in the moment all the time.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.351
I was in the moment,

32:42.395 --> 32:45.093
and the noises that I'm hearing
coming out of that house,

32:45.137 --> 32:48.401
I know she's in danger,
so I acted.

32:48.444 --> 32:51.099
- This an apology?

32:51.143 --> 32:54.015
- No. I would do it again.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.322
- Huh.

32:56.365 --> 32:59.803
Look, Jay, I mean,
I know how you're wired.

32:59.847 --> 33:00.848
Through the heart.

33:00.891 --> 33:03.329
Someone's in trouble,
you just go.

33:03.372 --> 33:06.288
That's part of what
makes you you.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.508
I made peace with it.

33:08.551 --> 33:10.466
I don't think you could be
any other way.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.471
So where's Shane Sullivan now?

33:15.515 --> 33:17.038
- He's in lockup.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.431
- All right, good.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.607
We still got
one last play left.

33:20.650 --> 33:23.044
- Let me take a run at him.
- No, I got this.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.698
- You people come into my house

33:24.741 --> 33:26.265
and accuse me
of hurting my wife?

33:26.308 --> 33:27.570
I never touched my wife.

33:27.614 --> 33:30.095
- That's not why you're here.

33:30.138 --> 33:32.184
You're here...

33:32.227 --> 33:34.360
'cause you've been hitting
check-cashing stores

33:34.403 --> 33:37.754
with Mike Brady
and Eric Walsh.

33:37.798 --> 33:42.411
And on the last job,
you killed this man.

33:42.455 --> 33:43.717
That's why you're here.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.284
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:45.327 --> 33:46.807
- You sure about that?

33:48.939 --> 33:50.463
'Cause right now,
your two partners

33:50.506 --> 33:51.551
are down the hall,
and they're each

33:51.594 --> 33:54.075
getting a chance
to tell their story.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.598
- We don't think it was you
that pulled the trigger

33:55.642 --> 33:56.643
and killed him.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.514
We think it was Brady.

33:58.558 --> 33:59.820
But we need you
to testify to that.

33:59.863 --> 34:01.691
Only one of you
will get this chance.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.867
- Look, Shane,
you tell us what happened,

34:03.911 --> 34:06.566
I might be able to work out
a deal with the ASA.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.744
- Sounds like maybe
I need a lawyer.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.398
- Yeah, maybe.

34:12.441 --> 34:14.269
Problem is,
you bring in a lawyer,

34:14.313 --> 34:15.792
that deal goes away.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.925
I gotta tell you,
you add felony murder

34:17.968 --> 34:19.100
to your résumé...

34:21.015 --> 34:23.800
That's game over.

34:23.844 --> 34:27.543
You know that.
You're going away for life.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.852
What's it gonna be?

34:34.550 --> 34:36.335
- I think you're fishing.
- Hmm.

34:36.378 --> 34:38.989
- And if you're not,
then bring it on,

34:39.033 --> 34:41.166
because I sure ain't
gonna help the cops,

34:41.209 --> 34:43.124
especially after
you used my wife

34:43.168 --> 34:44.256
and turned her against me.

34:44.299 --> 34:45.474
That's the lowest thing
you can do.

34:45.518 --> 34:47.911
- You know what?
We did try to use your wife.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.435
You're right.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.480
We tried.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.700
But she wouldn't cooperate.

34:53.743 --> 34:54.831
She didn't say
anything about you.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.311
She protected you
the whole way.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.704
- Did she?
- Yeah, she did.

34:57.747 --> 34:59.532
Probably because
she's terrified

34:59.575 --> 35:02.317
of what you might do to her.

35:02.361 --> 35:03.579
You remember this night?

35:03.623 --> 35:05.538
The night you put her
in the hospital?

35:05.581 --> 35:07.888
Mother of your daughter.

35:07.931 --> 35:09.585
You remember it?

35:12.980 --> 35:14.851
Let me ask you
something, Shane.

35:14.895 --> 35:17.027
Do you feel more powerful
when you beat up a woman?

35:19.639 --> 35:21.815
Does it make you feel
like more of a man?

35:24.078 --> 35:26.167
- As I recall,
she fell off her bicycle.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.650
- Hmm.

35:30.693 --> 35:33.087
- Now, can I have
my lawyer, please?

35:42.575 --> 35:45.143
- We had no choice, Hailey.
We had to go in.

35:47.188 --> 35:51.410
'Cause who knows
what that guy might've done?

35:51.453 --> 35:53.629
- Yeah.
No, you're right.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.544
We didn't have a choice.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.637
- Thank you.

36:07.991 --> 36:11.169
- And we got nothing else
on Brady and Walsh?

36:11.212 --> 36:12.474
- Nothing.
Crickets.

36:12.518 --> 36:15.608
- Yeah, they'll lay low
for a while, but...

36:15.651 --> 36:17.914
they are who they are,
and they'll hit again.

36:17.958 --> 36:21.483
And when they do,
we'll nail their asses.

36:21.527 --> 36:23.572
- So I just talked to Michelle.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.095
She's shaken up, obviously,
but she's willing

36:25.139 --> 36:26.358
to press charges
against her husband,

36:26.401 --> 36:28.142
so at least we'll catch him
on the domestic.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.622
- Well, that's good news.

36:29.665 --> 36:32.625
I'll talk to ASA Boyd,
get it fast-tracked.

36:32.668 --> 36:35.497
Let's slap him
with every charge we can.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.107
- Come on.

36:37.151 --> 36:39.153
- I still can't
get ahold of her.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.763
- Not surprised.

36:40.807 --> 36:41.938
- I'll keep trying.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.984
- Par for the course
with abuse victims.

36:44.027 --> 36:45.812
Nothing's harder than putting
your own family in jail.

36:45.855 --> 36:48.293
But we need these
domestic charges to stick.

36:48.336 --> 36:49.685
- Yeah.

36:49.729 --> 36:50.947
Hey, do you mind
sticking around for a minute?

36:50.991 --> 36:51.992
- Yeah.

36:54.081 --> 36:57.215
- Hey, Trudy, do you know
what cell Shane Sullivan's in?

36:57.258 --> 37:01.088
- Uh, Shane Sullivan...

37:01.131 --> 37:03.177
is not in a cell.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.788
He was transported
to domestic court

37:05.832 --> 37:07.312
and then released.

37:07.355 --> 37:08.574
- Released?

37:08.617 --> 37:11.446
- Yeah.
No complainant showed up.

37:11.490 --> 37:15.363
- When was this?
- Two hours ago.

37:15.407 --> 37:17.409
- Thanks.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.024
Jay.

37:49.092 --> 37:50.311
- Michelle?

37:52.792 --> 37:55.360
Michelle.
Michelle, are you okay?

37:55.403 --> 37:57.275
Are you okay?

37:59.451 --> 38:01.714
Is he still in the house?

38:01.757 --> 38:03.716
Okay, and your daughter?

38:03.759 --> 38:05.631
- She's at her cousin's.
- Okay.

38:05.674 --> 38:07.328
Please come with me right now.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.590
Please just get up
and come with me.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.549
Come on.
Let's go.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.072
It's gonna be okay.
Let's go.

38:12.115 --> 38:13.595
Come on.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.557
- What are you doing
in my house?

38:18.600 --> 38:20.254
Get away from my wife.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.736
- You take another step closer,
I'm gonna knock your ass out.

38:23.779 --> 38:25.259
- She's not going anywhere.

39:04.733 --> 39:05.995
- Thanks.

39:08.563 --> 39:09.651
I ordered you a double.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.000
- Thanks.

39:12.698 --> 39:14.003
- So?

39:15.570 --> 39:18.965
- So Michelle is on a plane
with her daughter.

39:19.008 --> 39:21.968
And her brother's gonna
pick them up in Phoenix.

39:22.011 --> 39:24.753
- That's great.
That's great news.

39:24.797 --> 39:28.801
- It is if she stays away
from Shane.

39:28.844 --> 39:30.629
- All you can do
is buy her the ticket.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.587
The rest is up to her.

39:34.110 --> 39:37.462
- I don't know how you went
through this growing up.

39:37.505 --> 39:38.680
- Hmm.

39:40.900 --> 39:44.338
Every situation's
a little different.

39:44.382 --> 39:48.081
My dad would come home drunk
after being out all night.

39:48.124 --> 39:49.430
My mom would say
something to him.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.345
He would snap.

39:54.914 --> 39:56.219
I was little,
so I just put a pillow

39:56.263 --> 39:59.222
over my head
to try to make it all go away.

39:59.266 --> 40:00.833
But you know, she would come
downstairs the next day

40:00.876 --> 40:02.748
with a bunch makeup on,
trying to cover it up.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.577
You could still
see the bruises.

40:05.620 --> 40:09.015
Every time, we would tell
ourselves it was the last time.

40:09.058 --> 40:10.712
But, of course,
it would happen again,

40:10.756 --> 40:14.237
and they were just
in this terrible dance.

40:16.631 --> 40:19.852
But you know,
I would close my eyes,

40:19.895 --> 40:22.463
and I would wish
that somebody would come in

40:22.507 --> 40:26.685
and just put him in his place.

40:26.728 --> 40:30.689
Do what you did.

40:30.732 --> 40:33.431
You did a good thing, Jay.

40:36.564 --> 40:39.045
- So what happened to your mom?
Where'd she go?

40:39.088 --> 40:42.918
- Nowhere.
She's still with my dad.
