It's time to wake up.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.391
Mmm.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.394
Let's go, we're late.
Let's go.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.682
The new school doesn't care.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.862
I care.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.694
One more bite.
I ate it.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.661
That's why I bought you that
59.99 LeSportsac backpack...

03:55.819 --> 03:58.493

we keep being late. Let's go.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.334
It says "stop."
Malia.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.045

that first letter make?

Sorry we're late.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.785
Good morning.
I just have one question.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.291
At Malia's old school,
her teacher used to

05:24.407 --> 05:25.784
stay late
sometimes after school

05:25.951 --> 05:27.328
to help her a little
bit with her reading...

05:27.494 --> 05:29.292
School's over at 3.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.416
For real?

05:32.958 --> 05:34.585
Yeah, for real.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.421
Okay.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.430
TEACHER: Yesterday we were
learning about nouns.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.270
Today we'll be
looking at verbs.

05:49.516 --> 05:53.817
It's how we express an action,
that's what verbs are for.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.947
So.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.943
In the sentence:

06:00.986 --> 06:04.331
"The penguin
dives into the sea."

06:05.615 --> 06:08.664
Where's the verb?
The action word?

06:11.121 --> 06:12.122
Anyone?

06:20.797 --> 06:22.799
How 'bout it, Tyler?
Wanna take a swing at it?

06:25.302 --> 06:27.020
I'm not doin' this for me.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.310
All right,
let's go back to anyone.

06:33.476 --> 06:34.853

us a break on tuition.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.660
She cannot stay in that class.

06:42.819 --> 06:46.164
No, Liz, that's exactly what I
said to that crazy teacher.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.282

Sure, I'll transfer you.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.593
Yeah, no, and the principal keeps
blowing me off over and over again.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.431
Oh, God. I'm sorry,
I gotta go. I gotta go.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.008

07:03.006 --> 07:07.011
No, I'm sorry, ma'am, Mr. Hart
is indisposed at the moment.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.931
Excuse me, ma'am, would you
please lower your voice?

07:11.097 --> 07:15.273
Oh, my boss can't talk right
now, so I'm a stupid cow?

07:15.602 --> 07:17.445
You wanna talk
to my supervisor?

07:17.854 --> 07:20.027
Okay. Sure, no problem.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.363
Oops, wrong button.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.744
Hey, Jamie.
Oh, Mr. Hart.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.746
Hey, Jamie, check this out.
Hey. Yes.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.533
"We must be the change we
wish to see." That's Gandhi.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.539
And it's good for car sales,
it's good for life.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.545
Boy, that little guy really
knew a thing or two, right?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.794
Listen, I just wanted to talk to
you because Jan mentioned to me...

07:36.873 --> 07:39.154
...that you might wanna cut
back on my hours a little bit.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.127
I'm still behind here.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.296
I completely understand.
You're tryin' to

07:43.421 --> 07:45.423
run an effective business.
I wanna help.

08:04.901 --> 08:05.902
I can't stand her.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.238
I can't. I can't.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.248
We talked about this, Breena.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.826
It's a Deborah-free zone
for our own sanity.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.536
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.589
You know, in a way,
I almost admire her.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.468
No ordinary deadbeat could
pull off the highest salary

08:21.626 --> 08:25.597
and the lowest job performance in
school history seven years running.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.098
Seriously, Breena.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.768
Except you're not
getting her subliterate kids

08:29.884 --> 08:32.182
that she passes
on to me. Okay?

08:32.345 --> 08:35.770
And I have to give them two
years of teaching in one.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.190
I know there's a lot of
Adams washouts, but still.

08:39.352 --> 08:44.279
The only thing that the district does
right is protect what it does wrong.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.943
Can't teach your way
out of a paper bag?

08:47.110 --> 08:49.863
Your students can't even spell
"paper bag"? No problem.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.454
We'll just transfer them on to
the next school, and the next.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.210
And if all else fails,
well, hey, there's

08:56.327 --> 08:58.955
Adams, where
education goes to die.

09:00.623 --> 09:01.624
Ahh!

09:03.001 --> 09:04.799
It's my shrink's idea.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.963
Every time I start obsessing
about how bad it's getting,

09:07.047 --> 09:08.672
I just snap myself out of it.

most in need.

That is so admirable.

CHARLES: Very idealistic,
she was.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.090
Well, I guess we both were.
I still wanted to design then.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.753
So we would stay up all night

of kids you can have in a class.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.101
So switch her with another kid.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.982
Or, so, get rid
of this teacher.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.393
The whole school
knows she's got

14:53.476 --> 14:55.353
a track history of
complaints against her.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.232
Oh, no, yes,
you can't! Right?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.868
'Cause she's
tenurized. Right?

15:02.026 --> 15:04.245
Yes, along with
a slew of other things

15:04.362 --> 15:06.581
spelled out in her
600 page contract.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.740
Right.

15:08.157 --> 15:12.412
Anyway, look at what she's dealin' with.
30 kids who hate school.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.372
Whose fault is that?

15:14.455 --> 15:18.460
It's not all hers. Every kid can't
rise to the top, I'm afraid.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.544
You're afraid?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.241
Have you heard
about those mothers

15:22.296 --> 15:24.765
that lift one-ton
trucks off their babies?

15:25.591 --> 15:27.514
They're nothing compared to me.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.352
No.

15:33.516 --> 15:36.861
Excuse me? He's not going
into a remedial classroom.

15:37.562 --> 15:41.692
But he's been acting out, and
he did test below the norm.

15:41.858 --> 15:45.237
He tested borderline. He's been
goin' through things at home.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.197
I'll keep working with him.

15:47.405 --> 15:50.750
If I may, I think that might
contribute to the acting out.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.709
Do you?

15:53.536 --> 15:57.006
Nona, this is not
a referendum on you.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.252
Maybe we all just need
to back off Cody a bit.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.717
Test results are test results.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.846
Hold up for a second.
Can't.

16:08.009 --> 16:10.103
Rosa Parks got a lottery.
I'm gonna beg to

16:10.219 --> 16:12.392
get him in.
Play the teacher card.

16:12.889 --> 16:15.062
First of all, a new school is not
gonna stop him from acting out.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.504
Why do you think
he's acting out?

16:16.559 --> 16:18.599
Honestly? Because you can't
not be a teacher to him.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.901
You don't think it's 'cause
of what's happening at home?

16:23.524 --> 16:26.778
You are all over
him all the time.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.571
And I know why.

16:28.738 --> 16:31.241
But at some point,
you have to let go.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.752
Nona.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.417
Nona!

16:47.465 --> 16:48.591
Hi.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.764
This is where I'm going?

16:50.927 --> 16:52.144
I hope so.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.930
We need some luck.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.857
Maybe I should
practice my reading.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.601
They'll want me if
my reading's good.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.816
Let's go find someplace to sit.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.657
Excuse me.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.872
Excuse me. I'm trying to
get my son in the lottery.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.203
It's too late. I'm sorry.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.164
Please, I'm a teacher. ls
there anyone I could talk to?

17:15.326 --> 17:19.126
You can try the principal. He's
right over there. Do you see him?

17:24.794 --> 17:26.512
How's it going
poaching my teachers?

17:26.671 --> 17:29.140
Oh, please. We don't
poach, we protect.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.141
Now, that's a good line. You
oughta use it more often.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.143
Oh, I forgot, you already do.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.975
Oh, here we go, union bashing.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.892
Here's a little secret: you can
criticize and support unions.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.026
Hey. How'd it go
with your brother?

17:41.185 --> 17:43.483
Oh, it was great.
He won, 3 to 2.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.398
Almost as good as you.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.364
But you don't support us, you know?
You shut us out.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.494
Yeah, because my teachers
want their freedom.

17:50.653 --> 17:54.999
To be overworked? To be fired
at any time for any reason?

17:55.157 --> 17:57.580
No, freedom to put in extra
time with their kids.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.371
You know, freedom to stay
after school if they want.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.415
Good luck to you.

18:02.582 --> 18:06.257
But do they want it, or are
they too scared to say no?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.054
You forget I was
a teacher once.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.839
No. I don't forget.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.550
You were one of the greats.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.515
Mr. Thompson.
My name is Nona Alberts.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.554
I'll have to talk
to you afterwards.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.063
Good evening, parents.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.372
Here's your charm.
Put it in your right hand.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.123
In our country,

18:36.198 --> 18:38.667
one child out of every four

18:39.201 --> 18:41.795
grows up not knowing
how to read properly.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.382
Let me ask you

18:44.915 --> 18:46.883
does that make you mad?

18:47.043 --> 18:48.044
ALL: Yes!

18:48.210 --> 18:50.759
Good, because
I want you to be mad.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.718
We have 40 spaces
for you in our school.

18:55.217 --> 18:59.267
So that means 400 of you are
going to have to go out there

18:59.347 --> 19:01.566
and fight for something better.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.568
Just like I did 10 years ago.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.731
I was a teacher,
a parent of two.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.649
I was sending my
kids to school,

19:09.732 --> 19:11.200
but they weren't
learning anything.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.448
Now I don't know
everything, but I knew

19:13.527 --> 19:15.621
I had to do something
to try to fix it.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.080
And now, Rosa Parks
is third in the state.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.046
But when I first
tried to start it,

19:28.125 --> 19:30.048
you know what they said to me?

19:30.586 --> 19:34.932
"Hold on. Wait.
We're addressing the problem."

19:35.132 --> 19:38.807
"Hold on, wait.
They're makin' changes."

19:38.969 --> 19:43.770
That word "wait" means they're not
going to do anything about it.

19:44.141 --> 19:47.270
I said then and
I'm saying it now.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.277
We will not wait.

19:53.984 --> 19:57.705
Are we going to wait while our
kids are dropping out of school?

19:57.780 --> 19:58.997
(PARENTS SHOUTING)

19:59.073 --> 20:02.623
Are we going to wait while the
school system is failing us?

20:02.785 --> 20:04.412
ALL: We will not wait.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.294
We will not wait.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.550
ALL: (CHANTING)
We will not wait!

20:09.625 --> 20:10.672
We will not wait!

20:10.835 --> 20:13.133
This is it!
This is our school.

20:13.462 --> 20:14.839
We will not wait!

20:16.882 --> 20:21.137
Okay, now, we're
about to begin the draw.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.977
Close your eyes. Close
your eyes and wish for it.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.643
First grade, three slots.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.061
Okay?

20:37.820 --> 20:39.493
Sarah Troy.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.248
Yes! Yes!

20:42.616 --> 20:44.459
Kenya Randall.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.917
JAMIE: Is that the teacher
in the other class?

20:47.121 --> 20:48.122
Yeah.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.132
THOMPSON: Easton Hawks.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.508
WOMAN: Yeah!

20:55.588 --> 20:58.137
Three slots now
for third grade.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.684
Oh, no. Okay.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.684
Go like this. It's better luck.
Luck's a lady.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.144
Luck is a foxy lady.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.775
LeShonda Jackson.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.315
Go, LeShonda!

21:18.194 --> 21:19.867
Chris Amodio.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.201
MAN: Yeah!

21:25.993 --> 21:29.497
The last slot for
the third grade goes to

21:36.504 --> 21:37.972
Robert Bryant.

21:42.051 --> 21:45.021
We have three
slots for fourth grade.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.186
Elijah Jones.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.308
(CONTINUES CALLING NAMES)

22:05.908 --> 22:08.127
Congratulations to all of you.

22:08.285 --> 22:11.505
And to everyone else,
we must fight on.

22:14.208 --> 22:19.339
This is a new day and we are
taking back our public schools.

22:21.799 --> 22:23.016
Thank you.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.437
Principal,
your car's ready for you.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.568
Listen, can I speak
to Mr. Thompson?

22:33.727 --> 22:35.400
Excuse me.
Mr. Thompson?

22:35.813 --> 22:36.814
Excuse me.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.824
JAMIE: You teach second
grade at Adams, right?

22:38.941 --> 22:40.568
My daughter just started there.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.407
Are you here for yourself
or for your kid?

22:42.528 --> 22:44.201
That's none of your business.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.413
What do you want from me?

22:45.531 --> 22:46.623
I want Malia in your class.

22:46.782 --> 22:49.581
It's a criminality keeping her in
the other class. You have no room?

22:49.743 --> 22:51.711
It's up to the principal!
The principal said no!

22:51.871 --> 22:53.123
Then there's nothing
I can do about it!

22:53.289 --> 22:54.541
That's what you all say!

22:54.707 --> 22:57.085
Would you tell me right
now what you can do?

22:57.251 --> 22:58.628
I can ask him
about it tomorrow.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.512
You're not gonna do that,
but thank you very much.

23:00.671 --> 23:02.423
You're not the only one bein' put off.
I said I'll ask.

23:02.590 --> 23:04.012
I've heard that before.
Not from me.

23:04.174 --> 23:05.426
This is for her.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.268
I understand.
I'll do it.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.029
Thank you!

23:51.221 --> 23:52.689
Can we talk now?

23:59.480 --> 24:02.154
I was thinking about
my mother's funeral.

24:04.026 --> 24:07.451
How word got out and all those
old students showed up.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.616
So many that they
had to wait outside.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.535
And it was galing.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.170
You remember that?

24:15.788 --> 24:16.789
Yeah.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.509
But they didn't care.

24:21.877 --> 24:26.178
They had to say something, remember
her, what she'd done for them.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.307
Nona.

24:27.383 --> 24:28.475
They wouldn't go away.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.390
They just

24:31.637 --> 24:34.732
had to speak.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.062
Needed to...

24:36.809 --> 24:41.406
Over and over, they just
kept saying the same thing.

24:41.563 --> 24:45.409
Her passion,
her passion, that passion.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.069
Nona. Listen to me.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.536
Can you please just not leave
so many empty hangers?

25:36.869 --> 25:38.792
How you doing
with that teacher?

25:43.667 --> 25:44.668
Malia?

25:45.586 --> 25:48.089
She hates you so she hates me.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.769
We're gonna get
you out of there.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.103
Whatever.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.494
Hey, how you doing?

26:18.660 --> 26:22.290
Hi! Well, it's casual Friday, so I feel great.
Can I help you?

26:22.372 --> 26:25.091
I hope so. My daughter's
getting crushed at Adams

26:25.167 --> 26:27.044
so I gotta talk to
your superintendent guy.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.887
He doesn't do walk-ins.
I'm sorry.

26:29.046 --> 26:31.845
Which I figured. I work
reception, too, at Hank Hart.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.430
And I know every once in a
while, there's an opening.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.095
I just figured I would
take a chance because

26:36.220 --> 26:37.767
my daughter is getting crushed.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.603
Wait, did you say
Hank Hart, the car guy?

26:39.681 --> 26:42.230
The guy who has his ads
all over the benches?

26:42.392 --> 26:43.609
Wow.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.737
Can I buy you a coffee?

26:46.313 --> 26:48.657
And I understand that but it's, like awful!
I understand.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.489
And Rosa Parks
was my last chance.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.282
And now I'm like
110 on the wait list.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.946
And that guy acted like he just

26:54.029 --> 26:56.327
extemporaneously went out
and made it happen.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.663
It's not like you can just
go and start a school!

26:58.826 --> 27:00.954
Actually, it doesn't stop
the parents from trying.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.913
And that was even before
they passed the law.

27:02.996 --> 27:03.963
What law?

27:04.039 --> 27:05.679
The one where you can
turn schools around.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.630
What, the parents can?

27:07.793 --> 27:10.091
Yeah. With the teachers,
if the school's failing.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.217
It's called the
Fail-Safe Law.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.969
But you know what?
It never happens.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.634
'Cause the guys here, I swear,

27:14.716 --> 27:16.434
they moonlight at
the Rivers Poker Room.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.113
They just drag
everything out until the

27:18.178 --> 27:19.600
parents just fold.
It's terrible.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.526
But if they kept at it, you think a
parent could turn a school around?

27:23.600 --> 27:25.944
No, the parents always give up.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.071
It's this whole big thing.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.607
Thank you, Collette.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.826
You have to find someone that
has the same idea as you do

27:35.904 --> 27:37.781
about the kind of
school that you want.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.117
Like who? A teacher?

27:39.241 --> 27:40.584
Yeah, like a teacher, or...

27:40.742 --> 27:42.790
The teachers and the parents,
they have to sign off on it,

27:42.870 --> 27:44.872
and then you have
to write a proposal,

27:44.955 --> 27:47.475
then you gotta jump through hoops
to deal with the school board.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.751
They make it near impossible.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.045
Parents need to just bang their
heads against a brick wall.

27:51.211 --> 27:53.555
It'd be a whole lot faster
and easier, let me tell you.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.054
I'm sorry.
No, no.

27:57.551 --> 27:58.723
Thanks for the coffee.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.061
Yeah.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.188
Sorry, I gotta
get back to work.

28:09.396 --> 28:10.648
Hey.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.071
They told me you'd be in here.
(SIGHS)

28:13.317 --> 28:14.318
Hi.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.157
Hi, I'm Nona, by the way.
I'm Jamie.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.867
Sorry about last night.
Yeah. No.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.535
It was a bad night
for all of us.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.372
I asked about
Malia switching and...

28:22.451 --> 28:23.577
Yeah.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.417
And he said no?
Yeah.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.510
Okay, that's...

28:33.045 --> 28:34.888
I'm sorry. You're,
like, the only person

28:34.963 --> 28:37.807
who actually does what she says
she's gonna do around here.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.804
I'm sorry.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.735
You want to start
a school with me?

28:49.019 --> 28:50.111
What?

28:50.270 --> 28:52.318
'Cause I'm sick of this.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.988
I can't take this any more

28:55.067 --> 28:57.911
and somebody told
me that if you

28:57.986 --> 29:00.409
find a teacher and you
stick with it long enough

29:00.489 --> 29:01.866
you can turn a school around.

29:03.825 --> 29:07.079
'Cause I'm just so tired
of getting shafted here.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.336
Thing that keeps
me up at night is

29:10.499 --> 29:12.843
why do I got to
let her down on this?

29:17.047 --> 29:18.845
So you want to
start a school with me?

29:22.469 --> 29:26.770
Listen, I know what you're saying,
more than you might think.

29:26.932 --> 29:30.778
But I'm not who you're looking for.
I wish I could say I was.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.234
I work in sales,
where success rate

29:33.355 --> 29:35.699
is based on need.
And you got need.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.447
I saw it last night.
You don't want to

29:37.567 --> 29:39.285
get left behind,
and neither do I.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.163
So,

29:41.613 --> 29:44.207
I'm gonna go to
District tomorrow

29:44.324 --> 29:46.918
at 9 a.m., figure out
how to do this.

29:48.245 --> 29:52.000
Could you take a sick day
and meet me there?

29:56.253 --> 29:57.425
Please?

30:36.293 --> 30:37.761
Oh, God.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.638
Oh, jeez.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.191
Oh, man.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.527
I'm just here for
the information.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.334
I'm not saying I'm gonna do anything.
I'm just gonna hear them out.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.865
That's all I'm asking.

31:48.365 --> 31:49.412
Okay!

31:49.741 --> 31:51.209
Once you finish
your proposal...

31:51.618 --> 31:54.246
That's this
400-page document?

31:54.413 --> 31:55.630
Once that's filled out,

31:55.705 --> 31:58.174
then you need to request an
appointment to schedule a hearing

31:58.250 --> 31:59.410
in front of the school board.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.712
That needs to be made on
the first Tuesday of the month

32:01.795 --> 32:04.594
except January and April, when it
needs to come on the second Monday.

32:04.756 --> 32:06.758
So it's not the actual
date we're scheduling?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.518
Oh, no, ma'am. You're
scheduling an appointment

32:08.593 --> 32:09.845
to schedule the date.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.398
You're kidding, right?

32:13.557 --> 32:15.230
No. No, no, no.

32:15.392 --> 32:18.692
It's no joke.
It's a process.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.778
First, we gotta get 50% of the
parents, 50% of the teachers

32:21.857 --> 32:23.359
to sign a petition
in support of us.

32:23.483 --> 32:24.985
That's 400 parents,
18 teachers.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.574
Then we gotta do the proposal

32:26.736 --> 32:28.376
and submit it on
the first Groundhog's Day

32:28.530 --> 32:30.157
of the Chinese lunar leap year.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.042
There's nothing in the
rules about leap years.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.875
And then, finally, we get
that school board hearing.

32:36.037 --> 32:38.165
But the school board term
ends in two months,

32:38.248 --> 32:39.591
which means we've
gotta do this fast.

32:39.666 --> 32:43.011
We gotta book that hearing, and we
can get this going for next fall.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.675
(CHUCKLING)

32:45.714 --> 32:46.966
Something funny?

32:47.132 --> 32:52.138
Start to finish, this process is
three to five years, minimum.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.732
It's just the way these people talk.
You can't go quitting now.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.456
Actually, I think
this is the best time.

33:01.563 --> 33:02.860
It's exactly what
they want us to do.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.233
They've done
a bang-up job.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.152
I can not ask 18 of my friends
to give up tenure and pension

33:07.319 --> 33:09.572
for a school where they're
not even guaranteed a job.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.661
I will. I'll do that.
Listen to me, all right?

33:12.282 --> 33:15.582
When I first started, I would
get so mad at those teachers.

33:15.744 --> 33:19.374
So mad at the checked-out zombies.
The Dawn of the Deborahs.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.504
Yes!
And they said just wait.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.427
Wait until you went through
eight different principals

33:24.586 --> 33:25.929
and parents who could care less

33:26.087 --> 33:27.464
and mountains of
district paperwork

33:27.631 --> 33:30.180
years of students
showing up hungry,

33:30.258 --> 33:31.851
showing up tired,
or not showing up at all.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.099
I can't have this not happen.
I need a teacher.

33:33.178 --> 33:36.148
You think you know what you're doing.
You have no idea.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.316
Where are you going?

33:38.433 --> 33:39.776
To figure out what
to do with my class.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.027
We don't have that option.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.855
'Cause Malia ended up across the hall.
How's that fair?

33:43.939 --> 33:44.940
It's not.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.985
Listen, I'll call you when I
get my first 100 parents.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.786
Or when I get my first 50!

33:49.861 --> 33:51.989
This is not over!

33:52.280 --> 33:54.533
It's not over!

33:55.283 --> 33:57.832
I'm trying to explain to you
why your kid's tanking!

33:57.994 --> 34:02.044
No, honey, I'm not saying your
kid in particular is an idiot.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.301
Good morning. Here.
Give this to your mama.

34:04.793 --> 34:07.717
Here, will you take one?
Just take one. Take it.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.429
Oh, I know you!

34:09.505 --> 34:11.975
Your daughter is in Malia's class!
Sorry.

34:13.176 --> 34:14.177
Morning!

34:26.356 --> 34:27.733
Hey, Daddy Drop-off.

34:27.815 --> 34:28.908
Hi.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.197
My name is Jamie, my daughter
Malia's in the second grade here.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.279
Could I talk to you
for just one second?

34:32.404 --> 34:34.371
I'm running late. It's
cool, I'll walk with you.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.078
I just wanted to ask you if
you'd eat in a restaurant

34:36.157 --> 34:37.625
that had an F
hanging in the window.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.623
You wouldn't, right? 'Cause
there'd be rattails and stuff

34:39.703 --> 34:41.080
in the food, and people's hair.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.802
So now, just envisualize
something for me.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.833
Envisualize an F hanging on the
door of your kid's school.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.252
Because it is, it's there.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.257
It's been hanging
there for 19 years,

34:48.378 --> 34:50.346
and nobody's done
anything about it.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.716
Rat tails,
you know what I mean?

34:53.216 --> 34:56.389
Take a look at that,
and sign that for me.

34:56.553 --> 34:57.770
And I'll find you at pick-up.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.098
Yeah, I'll look it over.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.437
Now you I know!

35:01.516 --> 35:03.518
You're gonna sign this. Okay?

35:10.358 --> 35:11.701
BOY: Excuse me!

35:12.694 --> 35:14.822
Why are we changing
all the desks around?

35:15.530 --> 35:19.000
'Cause we're gonna
try something new.

35:19.242 --> 35:20.835
How we do things.

35:20.994 --> 35:24.168
We're all gonna work a little harder.
Me included.

35:25.832 --> 35:26.833
Hey!

35:28.835 --> 35:30.837
Hi. Come on in.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.221
Thanks.

35:36.343 --> 35:37.845
Just give me a second here.

35:38.553 --> 35:39.554
Can't leave
the Man in Black hangin'.

35:39.721 --> 35:40.768
Oh, yeah.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.559
He's badass.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.644
What?

35:46.728 --> 35:48.730
Your sign. It's badass.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.531
Oh, yes.
(CHUCKLES)

35:51.399 --> 35:52.901
Yours isn't so bad either.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.411
Oh, no.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.452
Sorry.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.541
No, I'm sorry.

36:04.871 --> 36:06.623
Hi, how can I help you?

36:07.457 --> 36:09.209
I saw you teach.

36:10.377 --> 36:12.129
You're really good at it.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.631
Thank you.

36:14.130 --> 36:17.100
You think a whole school could be
like that, like how you do it?

36:18.385 --> 36:21.104
I don't know.
A whole school.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.435
I guess so.
It'd be pretty weird.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.602
Are you that lady
leading the charge outside?

36:26.685 --> 36:28.483
Yeah! Are people
talking about me already?

36:28.561 --> 36:29.562
Yeah, they are.

36:29.646 --> 36:32.616
So do you want to do that?
You want to start that school?

36:33.066 --> 36:34.363
Ahh...

36:34.442 --> 36:38.288
Do I want to start a school? No, I don't.
I just want to teach.

36:38.697 --> 36:39.818
So, what are you doing here?

36:39.906 --> 36:43.956
I chose to be here. Right
out of Teach For America.

36:47.122 --> 36:50.296
All right, Teacher For America.

36:51.793 --> 36:52.840
Meet me here

36:53.795 --> 36:55.342
at 8:00

36:56.965 --> 36:58.433
and I'll talk you into it.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.302
All right, we'll see.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.984
Hey! Oh, good!

37:12.147 --> 37:14.445
Good, you got my message.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.575
Look at those nails. Wow.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.282
Cheaper than therapy.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.289
53 parents?

37:21.489 --> 37:22.832
Yep.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.953
It is crazy how
bad they want it.

37:26.786 --> 37:27.833
So, what are you drinking?

37:27.996 --> 37:29.088
Fresca.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.670
Okay. Better pace yourself.

37:31.833 --> 37:35.838
So I'm thinking we get the parents
to sell it to the teachers.

37:36.004 --> 37:38.348
Which we can totally do.
We do, like, an event.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.634
Because we can do
this in two months.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.473
We do an event,
like at the dealership.

37:42.552 --> 37:45.977
Like an all-out blowout sale.
Something really big.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.017
And I got you some help.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.353
I don't want anyone
knowing about this.

37:51.519 --> 37:52.520
I didn't say you were doing it.

37:52.687 --> 37:53.688
I'm not in it.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.482
He's gonna help.
Trust me.

37:55.648 --> 37:57.525
He thinks this is a date. No.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.367
Yeah. Maybe.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.962
Hey.

38:09.037 --> 38:10.277
I told you I
worked here, right?

38:10.288 --> 38:11.460
No.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.503
Hi. Hey, Nona.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.880
How's it going?
Good.

38:19.047 --> 38:20.515
So, what are you drinking?

38:21.549 --> 38:22.641
JD, straight up.

38:22.717 --> 38:23.764
All right.

38:24.219 --> 38:29.146
So I wanted you to come because
Nona's doing the school thing...

38:29.307 --> 38:30.729
Nana's not doing
the school thing.

38:30.892 --> 38:33.190
...and we need some help getting
other teachers on board.

38:33.353 --> 38:34.605
And I've been
asking around about you.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.026
Everyone who
knows you likes you.

38:36.189 --> 38:38.817
And everybody who doesn't
calls you Sexy Texy.

38:42.195 --> 38:45.415
Well, like I told you, I'm just
interested in teaching so...

38:45.573 --> 38:47.746
Yeah, but you got free whiskey.

38:47.909 --> 38:50.082
So sit for a minute
and listen to the lady.

38:50.411 --> 38:51.754
Okay.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.581
Go, Nona.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.839
Well, if I did it...

38:56.918 --> 38:58.420
And I'm not saying that I am.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.509
We would have to
see how our school

39:00.630 --> 39:02.553
with the same kids
could do even better.

39:02.924 --> 39:07.395
Now, staff participation in the
classroom, articulated course curriculum,

39:07.554 --> 39:11.400
that would mean changing the
whole culture of the school.

39:12.392 --> 39:15.020
Basically, we would have to be the
teachers who made us teachers,

39:15.103 --> 39:16.980
but even better.

39:17.146 --> 39:19.365
Would the teachers
still be union?

39:20.567 --> 39:23.992
Can't be. Our contract has
too many restrictions.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.996
Because that matters a lot.

39:26.155 --> 39:30.535
Okay, so in two days, I got
53 parents and two teachers.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.170
I didn't...
I'm not getting...

39:32.328 --> 39:34.831
I see your lips moving,
but I can't hear you.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.341
You want a refill?

39:37.333 --> 39:38.334
Thank you.

39:38.459 --> 39:41.963
REPORTER: <i> Things are really coming to a head here.
The protestors are defiant.</i>

39:42.130 --> 39:45.680
<i>They're throwing bricks
and poles and trash cans.</i>

39:45.842 --> 39:47.219
Good night, Daniel.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.231
So this is good.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.233
Throwing bricks?

39:54.392 --> 39:55.609
How's that good?

39:55.852 --> 39:59.652
Because it's... You know, they're
lettin' themselves be heard.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.784
It's a waste of time.
It doesn't do anything.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.990
Doesn't do anything?
Really?

40:05.153 --> 40:06.325
You don't believe that.

40:06.446 --> 40:07.663
I don't know.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.369
Like civil rights.

40:09.449 --> 40:12.248
The Selma to Montgomery marches.
All that's a waste of time?

40:14.037 --> 40:15.539
It sends a message.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.466
I mean, that's what
you're doing, isn't it?

40:18.833 --> 40:20.835
No, I just want a
better school for my kid.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.181
Sending a message
is what people who

40:25.340 --> 40:26.901
don't work two jobs
have got time to do.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.181
Can you turn those
lights out for me? Yeah.

40:36.309 --> 40:37.982
You know what?
I really do appreciate

40:38.102 --> 40:39.775
what you're doing
to change the place.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.441
Course.
She's my kid.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.495
And her father,
does he help out at all?

40:47.654 --> 40:48.746
Nope.

40:50.782 --> 40:54.286
I'm sorry. When I drink,
I ask nosy questions.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.750
When I drink, I marry losers.

40:59.832 --> 41:03.006
Yeah, I'd say he's
definitely a loser now.

41:03.252 --> 41:05.300
I think so.
Yeah.

41:05.588 --> 41:08.057
And Malia is a winner,
'cause she's got you.

41:08.216 --> 41:10.059
You need to work on your lines.

41:10.218 --> 41:13.688
That wasn't a line. No, no, no,
it wasn't a line. I'm sorry.

41:13.846 --> 41:17.567
I've been around kids
a lot more than women lately.

41:17.725 --> 41:19.523
That's not a line?

41:20.228 --> 41:22.322
It's not a line.
It's true.

41:22.730 --> 41:26.655
Kids, you know, kids just say what's what.
Women don't do that so much.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.161
Except for you.

41:28.903 --> 41:32.077
That's true. Foot in the
horse's mouth, that's me.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.457
Yeah.

41:35.243 --> 41:36.790
That's why I like you.

41:38.454 --> 41:42.129
That was a line.
I admit it.

41:54.137 --> 41:55.764
No. Cody.

41:56.097 --> 41:58.316
You got this, I know you do.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.314
Yeah, is this
retard-proof?

42:00.476 --> 42:01.523
Stop saying that.

42:01.602 --> 42:02.694
Whole school knows it.

42:02.770 --> 42:03.771
(DOORBELL RINGS)

42:04.188 --> 42:05.610
Are they giving
you a hard time?

42:05.773 --> 42:08.822
Can't I just go to the school near
Uncle Roy while Dad's living with him?

42:08.901 --> 42:09.902
(DOORBELL RINGS)

42:18.161 --> 42:19.162
Pow!

42:21.497 --> 42:22.623
Hi.
Hi.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.258
Come on in, Malia.

42:24.584 --> 42:27.007
Nice. Yeesh!
Oh, no.

42:27.170 --> 42:28.638
Cody.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.555
Ooh la la.
Cody.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.429
Why don't you show Malia around
till your dad comes, okay?

42:36.512 --> 42:37.559
Oh, no, no, he doesn't have to.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.106
She's got her DVD player,
she's good.

42:39.182 --> 42:40.729
Can I watch?
JAMIE: Yeah, sure.

42:40.808 --> 42:42.902
He's not allowed to watch
TV during the day.

42:43.478 --> 42:44.479
(CHUCKLES)

42:46.397 --> 42:47.990
Do you guys want a Snickers?

42:53.863 --> 42:54.989
Come on.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.533
Come on in.
Yeah, go ahead.

42:58.117 --> 43:01.462
I know you're trepidatious
about this whole school thing

43:01.621 --> 43:03.589
and I don't wanna take up
your whole Saturday.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.590
But just to start off the bat,

43:09.128 --> 43:11.256
here is a flier that I made

43:11.798 --> 43:13.641
for the rally.

43:15.760 --> 43:19.060
Get it?
Parentrooper, paratrooper?

43:19.597 --> 43:20.769
Yeah.

43:21.224 --> 43:23.318
That one came to me
from the dead of sleep.

43:23.476 --> 43:28.027
I like it. Except there's a typo, unless
you're gonna have the rally in 2101.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.441
Oh, no.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.403
Yeah,
I'm terrible with numbers.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.707
I also have some
ideas for the school.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.368
About how to make the
school more effectual.

43:40.451 --> 43:41.577
Okay.

43:42.495 --> 43:45.294
So drawing outside the box,

43:46.207 --> 43:47.925
I don't know why,
but I started to think

43:48.042 --> 43:49.760
about those dumb
self-help books

43:49.919 --> 43:52.798
because there's always, like,
a little bit of truth in them.

43:52.964 --> 43:57.765
Like, for example, the whole
Secret-ing thing is so lame. I know.

43:57.927 --> 44:01.181
But I'm still envisualizing
that check in my mailbox.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.145
And I started thinking,

44:05.101 --> 44:08.446
you know, maybe the kids
could Secret things,

44:08.896 --> 44:11.866
like, you know,
I don't know, like...

44:13.526 --> 44:14.743
Like going to college.

44:14.902 --> 44:17.325
And they could
picture themselves

44:17.780 --> 44:22.957
going there and walking on the
campus and actually graduating.

44:23.119 --> 44:25.372
And I think that that
would be good for them

44:26.164 --> 44:27.711
to see themselves that way.

44:31.252 --> 44:32.549
You think that's dumb.

44:34.630 --> 44:36.974
I think it's a knockout.

44:38.134 --> 44:39.135
Really?

44:40.595 --> 44:41.847
Yeah.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.565
Really?
(HORN HONKING)

44:45.933 --> 44:47.731
Oh, can you excuse me for a sec?
Yeah, sure.

44:47.894 --> 44:50.113
Cody, your dad's here!

44:54.317 --> 44:56.820
Why is Cody talking about
going to school near you?

44:59.113 --> 45:01.332
'Cause it's a great school, and
we can't afford anywhere else.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.788
Except that he's not gonna live
with you and your brother.

45:03.868 --> 45:04.869
So you, of all people,

45:04.952 --> 45:06.124
you'd stop him from
getting the right schooling?

45:06.204 --> 45:07.205
Not gonna happen.

45:07.288 --> 45:10.007
And I should trust your
judgment, given what happened?

45:11.792 --> 45:15.797
Once things settle down, he'll stop acting out.
That's all this is.

guys been split up?

Not very.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.243
Yeah.

45:45.868 --> 45:47.211
Where were we?

45:47.703 --> 45:49.501
We were talking about
ideas for the school.

45:49.664 --> 45:53.544
Ideas, yeah.
I got boxes of ideas.

45:55.294 --> 45:59.140
You know, it comes down
to expecting more.

46:00.424 --> 46:05.271
From yourself, the teachers,
the kids, especially the kids.

46:09.475 --> 46:12.649
What?
My mom used to always say,

46:13.854 --> 46:16.698
"What are you gonna do with
your one and only life?"

so good at this.

What'd you hear?

47:03.070 --> 47:04.913
that you were
looking into it, but...

47:14.081 --> 47:16.880
What? And you didn't tell us?
You didn't tell me?

teaching at your school.

talk to you about this district...

Firing good teachers
to put in a school

51:05.479 --> 51:08.733
where I gotta work 20 hours
on top of my full-time.

51:08.899 --> 51:10.947
Go sell it to some other jerk.

called concerned parents!

51:25.833 --> 51:27.506

wanna hear about it.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.701
This is Jamie Fitzpatrick.

51:52.776 --> 51:56.406
I sold you a Buick Regal
sedan a few months ago.

51:56.488 --> 52:01.119
I gave you a great deal. Would
you please give me 10 seconds?

52:06.290 --> 52:07.712
WOMAN: Come on in.

52:08.375 --> 52:11.094
Could they possibly squeeze
one more lie into this thing?

52:11.170 --> 52:12.797
Who wrote this?

52:12.880 --> 52:15.178
Teachers Association
of Pennsylvania, maybe.

52:15.257 --> 52:17.225
It's their job to worry
about the Adams teachers.

52:17.384 --> 52:19.136
This is one school.

52:19.637 --> 52:23.232
I appreciate my union, but TAP
can get kinda hardcore about it.

52:23.891 --> 52:25.063
JAMIE: We'll get around this.

52:25.142 --> 52:27.270
So take me through
this one more time.

52:28.395 --> 52:30.489
A lot of these kids
can barely add,

52:30.606 --> 52:32.734
and you wanna be
teaching them geometry?

52:32.900 --> 52:34.994
Well, the problem is
is that no one expects

52:35.069 --> 52:36.309
them to do well, so they don't.

52:36.362 --> 52:38.831
Come on. Look around. I'm a cop.

52:38.906 --> 52:40.374
There's drugs, there's gangs...

52:40.449 --> 52:42.872
Change the school,
you change the neighborhood.

52:46.413 --> 52:47.585
Okay.

52:48.582 --> 52:50.425
I'll work on my neighbors.

52:50.584 --> 52:52.757
You really think you
could turn this around?

52:53.212 --> 52:54.930
Well, I can't say
for certain, but...

52:55.089 --> 52:56.807
100%, yes.

53:03.764 --> 53:05.766
JAMIE: Did you
sign the petition?

53:05.933 --> 53:06.934
No?
No.

53:07.101 --> 53:08.381
You didn't sign the petition?
No.

53:08.477 --> 53:11.356
Do it. Sign the petition.
It's gonna change everything.

53:11.438 --> 53:12.940
Give me the T-shirt.
Take one.

53:17.277 --> 53:19.951
Hey. Make sure
you get a T-shirt.

53:20.614 --> 53:21.911
Hey. How you doin?

53:22.032 --> 53:23.329
Good.

53:23.492 --> 53:26.996
Hug. One of my
favorite students.

53:27.413 --> 53:28.585
You okay?
I've got my ruler.

53:28.664 --> 53:29.665
Hey.
Hi.

53:29.832 --> 53:31.129
You all right?

53:31.291 --> 53:32.793
Don't be a drag.
Go get in there.

53:38.257 --> 53:39.258
Did you guys sign?

53:39.383 --> 53:40.430
I did.

53:40.592 --> 53:42.469
Let me give you a ruler.

53:42.970 --> 53:45.439
NONA: We want it to be a
school where even at 3:00,

53:45.639 --> 53:49.985
if the students have any
issues or any problems,

53:50.102 --> 53:51.649
then it's up to
the teacher to stay.

53:51.812 --> 53:54.315
Which we can't do now because
of teachers union rules.

53:57.651 --> 54:00.746
Thank you so much for coming.
Here, have a cookie.

54:00.904 --> 54:02.747
Have a cookie.
Have one. Take it.

54:02.906 --> 54:05.785
Have a cookie. I've got a
great photo op coming up.

54:05.951 --> 54:09.000
And don't go burying us after
Doppler Weekend Forecast.

54:09.163 --> 54:12.793
Don't! I know your game, okay?

54:12.958 --> 54:15.507
I'm Jamie, by the way.
All right.

54:18.839 --> 54:20.591
<i>Hey. Oh!</i>
(MEGAPHONE BLARING)

54:21.175 --> 54:25.476
<i>All right. Yeah,
we're goin' to school!</i>

54:36.732 --> 54:38.575
Yeah!

54:39.193 --> 54:43.198
It's crazy! You see
how bad they want it?

55:05.677 --> 55:07.304
Go get 'em, Jamie!

55:10.140 --> 55:14.441
I'm gonna keep this short, 'cause I get
trepidatious about group speaking.

55:16.188 --> 55:18.532
Adams is failing.

55:19.149 --> 55:20.776
This school is failing.

55:20.943 --> 55:22.411
And I can't afford to move,

55:22.486 --> 55:24.580
and I can't afford to put
my daughter somewhere else,

55:25.155 --> 55:27.249
so I'm screwed.

55:31.370 --> 55:35.466
And you know, I... Can I just
say, there's a time limit.

55:35.624 --> 55:37.342
There's a window
with these kids,

55:37.417 --> 55:38.839
and then after
that it's too late.

55:38.919 --> 55:40.091
You know what I'm sayin?

55:40.504 --> 55:42.677
And so we gotta do
something right now.

55:42.798 --> 55:45.017
We gotta do
something to fix it.

55:45.175 --> 55:47.269
Which is also why
I don't appreciate

55:47.386 --> 55:49.480
some scumbag from
TAP writing a letter

55:49.638 --> 55:52.517
with a bunch of lies about
what we're trying to do!

55:53.725 --> 55:56.524
Point here,
the thing I do wanna say,

55:56.687 --> 56:00.282
is we need to fix Adams, and
we need to fix it yesterday.

56:01.066 --> 56:02.568
ALL: Yeah!

56:02.734 --> 56:04.486
Now, I haven't
counted 'em all yet,

56:04.570 --> 56:08.370
but I know we have enough parent
petitions to start this thing!

56:09.449 --> 56:12.578
And, like that guy
Gandhi used to say:

56:12.744 --> 56:16.214
We gotta be the change
we wanna see!

56:22.629 --> 56:24.131
JAMIE: Your turn.

56:32.639 --> 56:35.859
All right, I've been
doing a lot of research

56:36.518 --> 56:38.520
and I read that there
are people out there

56:38.645 --> 56:40.693
designing and building prisons.

56:41.440 --> 56:44.364
And those people
are looking at our schools

56:44.610 --> 56:47.454
and they're figuring out
what kids are gonna drop out

56:47.613 --> 56:50.162
so they know how many
prison cells to build.

56:50.240 --> 56:51.742
(CROWD MURMURING)

In the last 19 years,
seven out of ten kids

56:55.078 --> 56:57.297
who leave Adams
can barely read.

57:00.375 --> 57:03.379
And we wonder why Adams kids
end up in Penn State Prison

57:03.545 --> 57:06.173
instead of the
University of Pittsburgh.

57:07.049 --> 57:09.427
And you know what I want to
say to those prison folk?

57:10.469 --> 57:13.018
I wanna say...

57:13.639 --> 57:16.062
I wanna say, hands off my kid.

57:17.100 --> 57:18.101
Yeah!

57:18.268 --> 57:20.145
MAN 2: Hands off our kids!
MAN: Absolutely!

57:43.543 --> 57:45.216
Watching you up there,
it was really...

57:45.337 --> 57:46.964
I don't know,
it reminded me of...

57:47.130 --> 57:48.973
Don't say your mother.

57:49.591 --> 57:52.219
Reminded me of something
I've been missing.

57:52.761 --> 57:54.001
It's really good
for the spirit.

57:54.054 --> 57:55.931
I know. Right?
Yeah.

57:56.390 --> 57:59.439
So how come you're not
buying what I'm selling?

58:00.560 --> 58:02.733
Because of the whole
union-slamming thing.

58:02.896 --> 58:03.943
"Union-slamming"?
Yeah.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.569
I wasn't slamming the unions.
Yeah, the union-slamming.

58:05.649 --> 58:07.242
They wrote that letter.
That was true.

58:07.401 --> 58:08.744
I know they wrote that letter.

58:08.860 --> 58:10.300
I was saying
something that was true.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.993
That's not the point.

58:13.407 --> 58:15.409
Look, Jamie,
when I was in high school

58:15.492 --> 58:17.085
I had this teacher
and his name was Mr. Cooper

58:17.244 --> 58:21.215
and he was, like, an incredible teacher.
He was like a father to me.

58:21.373 --> 58:22.920
And they tried to fire him

58:23.083 --> 58:25.711
because he was supposedly
teaching us works

58:25.794 --> 58:27.512
that were promoting
an immoral lifestyle.

58:27.671 --> 58:31.016
It was <i>Hair.</i>
It's a musical.

58:31.216 --> 58:34.060
There was all these, like, screaming meetings.
It got so ugly.

58:34.136 --> 58:35.763
But in the end
the union stood up,

58:35.971 --> 58:37.973
they protected him,
he kept his job

58:38.598 --> 58:43.229
and that's why I became a teacher.
He made me what I am.

58:44.062 --> 58:46.986
I just want a better school.

58:49.401 --> 58:52.405
I can't figure out how
to put it all together.

59:08.253 --> 59:10.096
GOULD: Rally was
an embarrassment.

59:10.172 --> 59:11.344
We used to be the heroes.

59:11.506 --> 59:13.304
When did Norma Rae
get to be the bad guy?

59:13.467 --> 59:16.516
Right? I hate gettin'
called out like that.

59:16.678 --> 59:18.726
Takes me right back
to third grade,

59:18.847 --> 59:20.895
with Ray Franks bullying
me in the school yard.

59:22.893 --> 59:24.520
I put a tack on his seat.

59:24.936 --> 59:27.109
Yeah, I lost recess for a week.
But you know what I learned?

59:27.272 --> 59:28.945
The futility of retaliation?

59:29.399 --> 59:31.652
The truth of social Darwinism.

59:32.611 --> 59:33.737
Hey.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.248
Did you write that
letter to the parents?

59:37.407 --> 59:39.580
Yeah, course I did.

59:39.743 --> 59:42.417
I'm just trying to stop the
pandemic of union-gutting

59:42.496 --> 59:44.248
that's going on in
this country right now.

59:44.414 --> 59:47.668
As if the teachers unions are
responsible for failing schools.

59:47.834 --> 59:51.088
No need to convince me.
But, the letter was...

59:51.254 --> 59:54.178
The letter was what? These
gals look motivated, yes?

59:54.341 --> 59:55.388
They do, they do.

59:55.550 --> 59:58.303
If they push this through, then
floodgates are gonna open,

59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.017
a lot of schools
are gonna start falling apart,

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.137
and a lot of good teachers
are gonna get pushed out.

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:04.810
Folks don't get
that this is not good!

01:00:04.976 --> 01:00:09.447
No. Because they
want change. Now.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:17.489
'Scuse me.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:19.574
I don't want it
to be like this.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:29.753
I didn't tell you sooner because
I wasn't sure I wanted it.

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:33.722
And when I realized I did,

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.265
and how bad,

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:41.264
I was scared you'd say no,
or you'd be pissed off,

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:43.306
so I fouled up.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:47.311
And it was my fault,
so I'm sorry.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:08.548
I'm gonna call a meeting

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.552
to find out how we
can make this work.

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:14.387
If you want it.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.887
Okay, this could
be our chance to be

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:23.889
the teachers we
always hoped to be.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.267
Who's saying we're not?

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.116
I really need you to
go to that meeting

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:37.034
and convince them.
They really look up to you.

01:01:37.194 --> 01:01:38.696
I just wanna teach.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:41.911
I just wanna put my feet up and
watch <i>Steelers Saturday Night,</i>

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:43.742
but I can't, do you
know what I'm saying?

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.035
I do.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:49.251
It's just, I don't understand you.
You're confusing me.

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:51.917
I thought you were somebody
that stood up for things.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.471
And now it's not all
black-and-white and comfortable

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.139
and so you freeze?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.933
I don't freeze,
I'm just not doing

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:01.768
what you want me to do.
There's a difference.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.098
Hello to you too, missy.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.062
MICHAEL: She's 8 years old.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:14.568
When she pushes you away,
it means she wants you more.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:17.109
She should learn that that's
not how it works in the world.

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:19.073
She's fighting
me on everything.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:23.411
Getting her to read is like
getting blood from a stone.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.746
You know, she asked
if I would help her.

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:29.003
She didn't want me to tell you.
I don't really know why.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.458
That's fine.

01:02:41.841 --> 01:02:43.138
Will you come to this meeting?

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.512
I'll think about it.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.018
Really?
Yeah.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.266
Yeah.

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:54.025
What?

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:57.657
I've just never
been able to talk

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.868
smart people into
doing things before.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.325
All right, all right.

01:03:05.073 --> 01:03:07.201
Come on, Malia, dinner's ready.

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:20.179
Hey.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.927
Go on, hurt me.

01:03:26.261 --> 01:03:27.934
I got all your apologies.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.723
I can explain.

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:31.100
No need, TAP already did.

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:32.563
What did they say?

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.228
What I already know.

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:37.026
That most of these
new schools fail.

01:03:37.188 --> 01:03:38.531
You wanna know why?

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.785
Because no one has the first
idea how to run them.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:44.321
Can you look me in the eye and
tell me that that won't happen?

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.034
I can't.
Well, that's great.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.492
That's great.
What about all the kids

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:49.792
that are gonna get
left behind, huh?

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.495
Nobody gets left behind,
I promise.

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:54.297
And without a union contract,
teachers will get forced out.

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:56.754
Not teachers who wanna teach.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:03.927
I'm just getting
through days, Nona.

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:06.343
So am I.
So are we all.

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.803
Breena, I'm just
trying to get back to

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.851
the way things were,
and I need you.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.401
Hey, Ben, this is Jamie.

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:21.111
Hi, how you doin?

01:04:23.651 --> 01:04:25.745
All right, so, look, I'm
gonna come to your meeting.

01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:27.864
All right, that's all I can promise.
That's great.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.458
Well, do you have any
questions we can answer now?

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.076
No. Good night.

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:34.086
Can I just pop in
and check the score?

01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:36.248
What are you, a Penguins fan?

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.208
Don't insult me.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:41.298
All right.
First playoff win.

01:04:42.879 --> 01:04:45.849
1970. 2-1.
Oakland Seals.

01:04:46.007 --> 01:04:48.430
Harbaruk scored on a one
timer from Wally Boyer.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:57.686
What qualifies
you to run a school?

01:04:57.852 --> 01:05:00.981
I mean, you're not exactly a shining
star in the classroom, are you?

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:02.148
Oh, shut it, Deb.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.488
But the point is,
don't you wanna

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:06.828
have a say in what
gets taught and how?

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:08.988
I mean, we're the ones
who know these kids.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.867
Now, you all have documents
with some thoughts,

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:14.248
but this is our
time to share ideas.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:16.500
Yeah, but we won't be union.
Do you understand?

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:19.253
But will you be able to teach?

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.839
Are you guys not listening?
There is no union here.

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:24.345
If we're gonna make this work,
take the risk...

01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:30.389
Yes, but listen, listen.
But listen.

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:33.396
The union won't allow
us to spend the time

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:35.223
that we have to
spend with them.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:36.398
They won't do it.

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:38.192
BREENA: Not only that,
what other business

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.317
says that you get a job for
life after two years? Come on!

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:42.776
BEN: Oh, no, don't do that.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:45.655
Everybody wants to laser-focus
on how TAP protects bad teachers

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:47.178
when mostly they
protect good ones.

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:49.078
Yes, but you make it
harder for the good ones

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:50.656
when you protect the bad ones.

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:52.740
But you know what? We're
gonna give up something,

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:53.996
but we're also gonna get.

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:55.497
We all getting the same, Nona?

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.378
Or is it seniority?
Exactly.

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:03.835
MAN: It's all right
for you younger people.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:05.003
BREENA: Stop it, Ben.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:08.260
Seriously. No. You just
keep going on and on.

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:18.937
You know what, who else
is in this for the money?

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:20.735
Put your hands up, come on!

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:23.355
I know I'm not
the only money-grubbing

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:25.315
bastard in the room!
Put your hands up!

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:30.537
I mean, seriously, why else are
we doing it if not for the money?

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.710
Why are we gettin' up
at the crack of dawn

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.874
and paying for pencils
out of our own paychecks

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:36.580
and babysitting screaming brats

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:38.336
for seven hours if
not for the money?

01:06:39.037 --> 01:06:42.132
It's not like anyone in this room
ever wanted to teach, right?

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:47.421
And getting a school where we could
actually do what we wanna do,

01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:49.134
who needs it, right?

01:06:49.756 --> 01:06:50.757
Right?

01:06:54.761 --> 01:06:55.933
You know what,

01:06:56.304 --> 01:06:59.308
feel free to blow past
the dream school part

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:01.272
and skip to the cash
figures on page seven,

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:03.144
but either way,
do yourselves a favor.

01:07:03.311 --> 01:07:05.905
Take the 10 minutes
and read the damn document.

01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:13.450
DEBORAH: "Dream school."

01:07:13.655 --> 01:07:15.908
You'll march yourself right
into the welfare office.

01:07:16.074 --> 01:07:17.872
Right out of here,
right into welfare.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.411
Good riddance.

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:25.254
Who needs a pen?
I got one free.

01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:35.889
Yes.

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:39.852
No, no, no.

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:41.186
Yes.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:42.896
Yes, yes, yes.

01:07:43.017 --> 01:07:44.564
Oh. Stop. Stop.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:46.479
We got more. Yes.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:51.617
Are you sure these are virgin?
'Cause I'm feeling something.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.403
Yeah, it's called success.

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:54.913
No wonder it tastes new.

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:07.835
Yo, JD, get out there
and get these ladies to dance.

01:08:08.293 --> 01:08:09.761
I don't dance, sorry.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:12.222
Yes, you do.
I saw you dancing at school.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:14.011
That was line dancing.

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:15.925
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
I liked that.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:18.220
I'm in if he
takes his shirt off!

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.475
That's not gonna happen.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:22.557
All right.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:25.018
All right, who here
knows the Texas Tush Push?

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:26.231
I kinda know it.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:27.520
Come on, come on.

01:08:27.687 --> 01:08:29.048
Okay, let's do this!
Come on, guys.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.573
Give me, like,
two lines over here.

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:31.984
I like you again.

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:36.738
Proud of you.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.032
MICHAEL: Ready?
Okay, check it out.

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:42.752
All right, it's very simple. So we
start feet together. And you go:

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:45.997
Heel together, heel, heel.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:49.466
We've got our parents,
we've got our teachers.

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:52.595
I am looking forward to
getting to that school board.

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.131
Heel, clap.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:57.470
Maybe less <i>Riverdance</i> and a
little bit more, just like...

01:08:57.634 --> 01:08:58.977
A little bit more.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.138
I wanna see you dance.

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:04.015
Come on, I wanna see you dance.

01:09:04.182 --> 01:09:06.685
I haven't danced since "Gettin' Jiggy
Wit it" and I wasn't jiggy then.

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:09.229
So it's time!
I wanna see you dance.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:10.395
No! MICHAEL: Jamie, get up here.

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.564
Come out here. Come on.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.823
That's right.
You get up here too, Nona.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.202
No. I can't and I won't.

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:19.035
Come on, Nona!
(ALL CHANTING)

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.872
No! No Nona!

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.451
Nona! Nona!

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:24.618
Come on.

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:26.037
Come on, come on.

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.594
Come on, let's shake
those hips, all right?

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:42.934
Here we go.
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.060
ALL: Clap.

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.989
Good morning.
I'm Evelyn Riske.

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:44.408
Yeah, I know who you are.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:45.917
Do you have a moment?

01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:48.911
Not unless you
wanna buy a Buick.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:52.127
If you sell cars like you sell
schools, I'm walking out with one.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:54.292
Don't talk down
to me, Ms. Riske.

01:10:54.459 --> 01:10:56.006
Oh, I'm not.

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.421
Let me tell you why I'm here.
Yeah.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:02.137
I still think it's a long shot
you get this by the Board.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:05.019
But I can't ignore what you've
been able to do with the teachers.

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.055
And if you're gonna do this,

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:09.311
you might as well have all
the information possible.

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:12.814
There's a school
I want you to see.

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:14.445
They got a lot of great ideas.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:16.606
Ideas you should look into.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:19.071
How about you meet me there tomorrow.
(PHONE RINGING)

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.283
Yeah, you gotta go.
She's itching to fire me.

01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:24.951
Let me call you with a time.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.115
Hold on one second.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.125
Hank Hart Auto.
Please hold.

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:31.245
Yeah, okay.

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:32.876
Okay.
Perfect.

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:34.214
See you tomorrow.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:35.716
Okay, good.
Hi. How are you?

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.715
JAMIE: Ideas are good.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:40.054
I'm working.

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:43.508
I'm working.
Unlike your husband.

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:46.060
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>This is the Department
of Education scheduling hotline.</i>

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.855
<i>You are currently number...</i>
MAN'S VOICE: <i>45.</i>

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:49.104
<i>...in queue.</i>

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:54.439
Ms. Lopez?
I'm Nona Alberts.

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:57.042
I've been trying to get in touch
with you to talk about Adams.

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:58.280
You've got an appointment?

01:11:58.439 --> 01:12:00.032
The next available's
five weeks away.

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:01.911
I very much look forward
to seeing you then.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:03.945
That's the day your term ends.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:07.536
Look, I live and breathe this bureaucracy.
I share your frustration.

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:10.998
What can I say? I read Kafka
to make myself feel better.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.209
I want a hearing for my
school before the term ends.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.331
Dreams are important.

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:17.629
Then we don't stand a chance of
getting this done for next year.

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:21.046
Which you don't anyway,
not in this system.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.139
But the time can
be a gift, trust me.

01:12:24.298 --> 01:12:27.017
You'll hone your proposal,
build support.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:30.271
Then you'll soon come
to embrace futility.

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:31.772
It's a win-win.

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.400
I can't wait. I won't.

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:36.607
See you in five weeks,
Ms. Alberts.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:42.408
I'm sorry. I had to
take three buses.

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:44.160
And you're apologizing?

01:12:46.654 --> 01:12:47.951
Wow.

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:53.920
My daughter would love this.

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:57.048
She wants to be a computer
engineer when she grows up.

01:12:57.999 --> 01:13:00.343
While at the same time
being a hair colorist

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.803
and President of
the United States

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:06.349
and a veterinarian
for lost dogs.

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:11.767
My niece is gonna be
a professional princess.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:16.521
Good luck to her.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:19.441
I know.

01:13:20.605 --> 01:13:22.323
So when you picture
the perfect school

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:24.233
for Malia, what's it look like?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.652
Like this.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.196
That's why I
wanted you to see it.

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:29.989
I know Malia has dyslexia

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:33.501
and most private schools are not
helpful with learning disabilities.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.086
This one is.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:37.497
Yeah, I'd never want her to
be in the dumb kids' class.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:39.836
Oh, they don't do that here.
No otherness.

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:43.344
They do it right, but it took
them years to get it right.

01:13:43.502 --> 01:13:46.255
And that's why I worry for
you with your school.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:48.675
You've looked into all the
possibilities for her, right?

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:50.041
While you're working on Adams?

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:53.020
Oh, man. I have. I just
can't afford anything else.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:55.932
The tuition's 23 grand.
That's what I make in a year.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:57.520
Schools have aid packages.

01:13:57.683 --> 01:13:59.936
Almost half
the kids here get help.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.524
Let me put in
a good word for you.

01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:06.860
What, for Malia to
have a scholarship here?

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:12.952
Are you buying me off?

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.076
I'm giving you an option.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:18.417
Which is the
whole point, right?

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:22.876
Look, I'm not against what you're
doing, but it is so complicated.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.885
We gotta catch up.
You need to give us time.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:26.921
No, I don't have time.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:28.465
But you're a great mother.

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:32.469
You really wanna sacrifice your
child's interests to send a message?

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:37.106
Okay, so how about Nona?

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:40.651
Sometimes public
school teachers

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.734
have a really hard time sending
their kids to private schools.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:46.115
It's silly, because half the
Board of Ed's kids go here.

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:47.741
Really?
Yeah.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.904
You come on board though, and it
might make it easier for Nona.

01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:54.240
The numbers don't lie.

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:57.160
At Adams, 2% get to college.

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.749
Here, 2% don't.

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:03.340
That's crazy.

01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:15.311
All-out war is how we gotta look
at it with this school board.

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:18.102
Still no read on Olivia

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:22.102
despite my e-mail assault.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:26.106
Schwartz might be our only yes.

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:28.024
She likes new things.

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:29.658
Southwick,

01:15:29.817 --> 01:15:33.117
she'll go no. She's had five
campaigns underwritten by TAP.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:37.496
Same with Brandt, he's a
stickler for line-item stuff.

01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:40.332
Parrish, Mannie,

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:43.623
who knows?
But I'm guessing no.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:46.133
King, he's a wild card.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:48.795
Apparently he's been legally
dead since the late '90s.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:50.547
He sleeps through the meetings

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:53.132
and then he shows a faint
pulse right before the vote.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:54.300
So.

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:58.145
We might be looking at
six out of seven votes

01:15:58.804 --> 01:15:59.976
against us.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:05.398
And that's if we
even get a hearing.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:08.526
What's wrong?

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:10.649
Nothing.

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:14.408
It's just Malia stuff.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:18.165
Okay.

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:47.570
I think I'm gonna
run for School Board.

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:50.026
See all those Beemers outside?

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.737
What's wrong with you?
You seem antsy.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.527
It just bugs me.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.077
Oh, here she comes.

01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:57.955
Oh, jeez.

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:02.418
I read through those ideas.
Very impressive.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:03.702
Thank you.

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:07.965
But we've heard lots of
big ideas about schools.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.671
Big ideas are big fun,

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.635
but you can sink or swim
on the practical ones.

01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:12.711
I have those too.

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:13.925
Ones that work.

01:17:14.046 --> 01:17:15.138
Come watch me teach.

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.549
I don't usually do that.

01:17:16.715 --> 01:17:17.955
Then how do you
know what works?

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.053
I'll consider it.

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:23.430
In time for us to get
a hearing this year?

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:25.474
Don't you know
the moral of Icarus?

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.234
Yeah, wear sunscreen.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.943
That's a little
post-modern.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:33.608
I'll give it some thought.

01:17:33.774 --> 01:17:36.072
And I did like your ideas.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.581
She liked our ideas.

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:45.995
They're your ideas.

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:48.585
Shut up and take
the compliment.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.961
Hi, I'm Jamie Fitzpatrick.
Go ahead.

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:55.254
Thanks.

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:58.345
Hi. I'm not gonna take it. I'm
not gonna take the scholarship.

01:17:58.507 --> 01:18:00.680
Our school's gonna work out.
Our ideas are really good.

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:04.101
And my daughter is already gonna
have a hard time respecting me

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:05.557
'cause I didn't go to college.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:10.152
If I also give up, sell out,
screw over my friends...

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:11.604
Your daughter will respect you

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:13.655
because you made
the right decision for her.

01:18:13.772 --> 01:18:14.773
In your opinion.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.034
In my educated opinion, yes.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:24.120
And what about Nona and her son

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:26.331
and all the other kids at Adams

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:27.971
who you're not
offering scholarships to?

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:30.540
Look, I admire your ideals.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:32.708
But Malia will suffer for them.

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:34.840
In your educated opinion.

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:36.219
No, that's a fact.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:37.379
Don't do that.

01:18:38.005 --> 01:18:40.303
Don't use my
daughter to scare me.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:46.639
There's another thing that's bugging me.
You knew about her dyslexia.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:49.103
You must have been talking
to somebody at Adams.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:51.151
Okay, now you're
being paranoid.

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:52.812
It's not paranoid if it's true.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.070
No.

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.732
You have no idea what's true

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:58.655
and what's not,
so let me help you with that.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:05.332
My parents organized
the first union

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:10.088
in a textile mill in Marion, South
Carolina in October of 1967

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:13.716
and as a daughter,
I know what it cost.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:16.920
And the truth is,
at the end of the day,

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.509
it's very unlikely
you'll get your school.

01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:22.015
Your daughter will
still be at Adams.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.677
And you will have deprived her

01:19:24.843 --> 01:19:26.891
of the one opportunity
to turn her life around

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:28.897
so that she can become
a computer engineer

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:30.857
and President
of the United States

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:33.519
and a veterinarian
for lost dogs.

01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:39.237
And there's your truth.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.452
Thanks.

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:20.445
You can't be here.

01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:22.951
How come you didn't tell
me about Riske's offer?

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.204
She called you already?

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:26.909
JAN: You just had lunch.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:29.583
Can I talk to you outside?

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:31.085
JAN: This is not break.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.917
I can't talk to you in here.
Can I talk to you, please?

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:37.879
JAN: Jamie, you just took
an hour and a half for lunch!

01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:40.340
I didn't do anything.

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:42.342
I was just talking to her.
Yes, you did do something.

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:44.674
I didn't want to upset you. Could
you give me a break, please?

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:45.804
I'm talkin' to Hank.

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:47.718
Would you do that?
Could you get me down

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:49.595
to one job by
the end of the day?

01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:51.139
Anyway...
What?

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:52.898
No, it doesn't matter.

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:54.608
It matters! It matters!
You lied to me.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:57.111
Not telling you is not the
same thing as lying to you!

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.943
Yes, it is! What, to a second grader?
What did you say to me?

01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:02.324
"She's the only one here who does
what she says she's gonna do."

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:03.742
That's what you said!

01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:05.778
How is that workin' for you?
I said no!

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:07.537
Why? Why?
What did you...

01:21:07.654 --> 01:21:09.247
Because I believe in you!

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:18.295
What great thing
happened to me?

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.927
I got a phone call from Tyler.

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:25.552
And he called me on the
phone number I gave out.

01:21:25.798 --> 01:21:27.266
Why'd you call me, Tyler?

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:28.550
I had a question.

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:32.434
He had a question
about the famous speech

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:34.140
I sent home with you last night

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.600
to discuss with
your parents and

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:37.146
grandparents.
And did you do that?

01:21:37.309 --> 01:21:38.310
ALL: Yes!

01:21:38.477 --> 01:21:41.572
Very good! Now, we're gonna get
to Tyler's question in a minute.

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:44.779
So the speech,

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:48.913
"Let us tenderly and kindly
cherish, therefore...

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:51.290
"...the means of" what?

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:53.450
ALL: Knowledge!

01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:55.494
Knowledge!
Which is why I sent it

01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:57.496
home with you in
the first place.

01:21:57.663 --> 01:21:58.835
The means of knowledge.

01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:00.670
So you ready for
the second part?

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:02.005
ALL: Yes!

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.840
"Let us dare to"?
ALL: Read!

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:05.504
"Let us dare to"?
ALL: Think!

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:07.173
"Let us dare to"?
ALL: Speak!

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:08.841
"Let us dare to"?
ALL: Write!

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:11.601
"Let us dare to read, think,
speak and write."

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:12.852
And, Tyler, who wrote that?

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:13.929
John Adams.

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:17.516
John Adams, our country's
second president.

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:21.111
Tyler's question,
his question was,

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.068
"Is that the same
Adams that the school

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:25.031
is named after?"
And I told you...

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:26.108
Yes.

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.239
Yes. And the reason
why that is a perfect

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.454
question is that
you dared to think.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:34.704
"Dare to read, think, speak
and write." Who wrote that?

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.540
ALL: John Adams!

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:38.750
Our school's name is...

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:41.165
ALL: Adams!

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.883
All right!

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:44.460
(BELL RINGING) Beautiful.

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:48.384
You did well.

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:53.928
BOY: Bye.

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:56.431
GIRL: See you tomorrow.

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:57.723
BOY 2: Bye.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.227
NONA: I didn't know
you were watching.

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:03.896
Lets me see what kind of
teacher you really are.

01:23:04.062 --> 01:23:06.190
Also, I hate
social pleasantries.

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:07.824
Then I'll just
keep it at thank you.

01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:09.443
Don't thank me.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.704
Ever had a Blue Mojito,
Mrs. Alberts?

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:14.035
I don't drink.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:18.044
Well, now, see, that's something
else you could work on.

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:20.629
I mention the Blue Mojito

01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:24.667
because the only thing
standing between it and me

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:26.050
is you.

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:28.549
And right now there's
a lovely place in

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.014
Coconut Grove
with a chilled glass

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:34.097
waiting for me to fill
out my retirement papers

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:37.513
pack up my condo and get a
one-way ticket to Miami-Dade.

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:39.185
Well, I understand...

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:40.474
No, you don't.

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:42.484
Look, I'm running late.
Walk with me.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:46.481
I didn't drink
before I got to this job.

01:23:46.647 --> 01:23:48.445
I was a go-getter
like you.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:51.281
And next thing I knew,
I'm this.

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:53.116
The Queen Bureaucrat.

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:55.906
Now, that's not something
I want on my headstone,

01:23:56.073 --> 01:23:57.871
"She filled space,
RIP."

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:00.001
So you're saying don't bother?

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.413
I'm saying I want to help.

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.583
Hearing in 10 days.
You want it?

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:07.046
Yes, absolutely.

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:08.506
Great.

01:24:09.002 --> 01:24:11.175
Now, listen to me carefully.

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:14.433
This board finds
reasons to say no.

01:24:15.717 --> 01:24:19.893
Last year we killed a proposal
for not having a proper index.

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:23.855
So, I's dotted, T's crossed.

01:24:24.351 --> 01:24:26.445
And good luck and so forth.

01:24:43.537 --> 01:24:45.039
You need help?

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.417
No, I got it.

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:52.930
You sure?

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:58.185
You got the 446 Provisions and
the Writers' Mentors Program?

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.061
Yup, I got 'em both.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.977
I's dotted, T's crossed.

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:06.523
I heard you
the first six times.

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:13.988
Hi.
Hey.

01:25:14.318 --> 01:25:15.615
How is she?

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.029
Aces.

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.131
Starving.

01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:31.377
Look at this.
Did you see these?

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:34.872
They're goin' up around the
streets, all around school.

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:36.682
It's got my name on it.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.343
Big deal.
Sticks and stones.

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:43.222
It kind of is a big deal,
because I'm not anti-labor.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:45.934
I think you don't really
know what you're asking.

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.154
I don't know what I'm asking?

01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:55.151
I've spent most of my life without
job security. It's awful.

01:25:55.317 --> 01:25:56.569
There's other ways
to fix this problem.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:57.945
Yeah? Like what?

01:25:58.111 --> 01:26:00.864
Like figure it out
with TAP, for instance,

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:02.369
because it's not
all on the union.

01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:04.417
There's other
things at work, okay?

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:06.002
There's community,
there's poverty...

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:11.710
I can't wait to figure it
out with 10,000 studies

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:13.920
about how being
poor affects education!

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:16.972
I can tell you being poor
sucks and my kid can't read!

01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:18.803
I'm not gonna be
a part of this.

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.344
So you're gonna do nothing.

01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:26.391
I don't do nothing. I teach.
That's not doing nothing!

01:26:26.556 --> 01:26:28.183
That's great for your 30 kids!

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.439
How 'bout the rest of the kids?
How 'bout Malia?

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:35.070
This whole system
is broken. It's dead.

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:39.453
I need you to take a stand on this.
I need you in this fight.

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:42.239
If there's a problem,
I'm getting rid of it.

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:46.998
That doesn't just go for
the school, by the way.

01:26:52.499 --> 01:26:53.625
Really?

01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:00.636
Okay.

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.361
Hi.

01:27:22.362 --> 01:27:23.659
See you next weekend.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:25.119
I got a surprise for
you in the dining room.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.492
Cool.

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:28.452
Hey.

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:32.088
Ask him about his shirt.

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.216
What about it?

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:35.834
He wouldn't tell me.
Just ask him.

01:27:41.506 --> 01:27:43.258
This is awesome.

01:27:44.342 --> 01:27:45.559
What's that?

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:47.850
Nosebleed.

01:27:48.054 --> 01:27:49.556
That's not true.

01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:51.270
Why are they on you?

01:27:51.433 --> 01:27:52.776
Because I'm slow.

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:56.529
You know you're not slow.

01:27:57.856 --> 01:28:00.700
I know you don't want
me to think I'm slow.

01:28:57.666 --> 01:28:59.088
(IMITATING LASER GUNS)

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:46.799
(PANTING)

01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:56.232
GOULD: This is the
eleventh hour, Evelyn.

01:29:56.349 --> 01:30:00.229
Don't quit me here. Don't
underestimate this, okay?

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:02.105
It's a feeding frenzy.

01:30:02.272 --> 01:30:04.741
District offices
all over the state

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:06.318
are getting slammed with calls.

01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:08.403
"Oh, let's do what
they're doing at Adams."

01:30:08.486 --> 01:30:09.703
We're still fine
with the school board.

01:30:09.779 --> 01:30:12.498
Right now we've got it at 5-2
against, if King sticks.

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:16.127
No, that's too close.
Go back to the teachers.

01:30:16.286 --> 01:30:19.631
Seriously, this would be like
handing over planes to passengers.

01:30:19.706 --> 01:30:21.003
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:24.466
But don't we have some
responsibility to the kids as well?

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:27.173
That's what they asked
Albert Shanker. Okay?

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:30.809
He was the FDR of
teachers union presidents.

01:30:30.884 --> 01:30:32.181
You know what he said?

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:33.261
I'm sure you'll tell me.

01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:35.518
He said, "When schoolchildren
start paying union dues,

01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:38.483
I will start representing the
interests of schoolchildren."

01:30:39.684 --> 01:30:40.856
What?

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:45.111
I lost it on Jamie Fitzpatrick.

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:48.152
For a second I saw
how she saw me, and I...

01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:52.698
Do you ever wonder
if we all stepped back...

01:30:53.657 --> 01:30:57.457
No. No doubts.
No pussy-footing.

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:01.169
Are you not aware of what is
going on in this country?

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:05.878
People, you should
hear this. Okay?

01:31:06.962 --> 01:31:09.841
We're under attack. Labor.

01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:12.725
Unions are getting pulverized.

01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:16.388
And how is it that unions,
of all things

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:20.400
are getting blamed for the
economic cesspool that we're in?

01:31:20.558 --> 01:31:23.653
Not greedy management, unions.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:28.029
Same unions that
Clarence Darrow once said

01:31:28.191 --> 01:31:31.536
have done more for humanity than
any other organization of men

01:31:31.611 --> 01:31:33.238
that ever existed.

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:35.081
All we want

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:40.542
is for teachers to be well
paid and secure in their jobs.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:45.417
Who could argue
with this philosophy?

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:48.177
It's for teachers.

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:49.713
Remember that.

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:54.555
Under attack,
we attack, Evelyn.

01:31:56.261 --> 01:31:58.855
Did you fix those
attendance records?

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.016
You know I did.

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:03.564
How would I know that?

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:05.070
Because you told me to.

01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:07.856
I would never tell a teacher
to fix attendance records.

01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:09.907
It's illegal,
not to mention unethical.

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:11.360
Is this because of our hearing?

01:32:11.443 --> 01:32:15.869
Unfortunately, the rules on this
kind of infraction are clear.

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:18.955
Immediate academic suspension.

01:32:23.079 --> 01:32:25.582
Robert, don't do this.

01:32:25.665 --> 01:32:27.793
It's already done.
It's for the kids' sake.

01:32:27.959 --> 01:32:30.303
The same kids you
cared enough about

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:32.806
to mark present
when they were absent?

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:40.055
I need to talk to them.

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:43.646
Academic suspension means
you cannot be on campus.

01:32:43.808 --> 01:32:46.152
Now, if you're on campus,
you will be arrested.

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:47.938
I just wanna say goodbye.

01:32:48.104 --> 01:32:50.778
I was worried you
might get feisty.

01:32:51.608 --> 01:32:53.360
If I've made it a little harder

01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:55.328
for you to take
my job, I'm glad.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:01.743
That's feisty!

01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:08.417
Sorry.

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:12.762
What happened?
Where is she?

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:14.173
I got a call.

01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:15.739
'Scuse me,
this class is in session.

01:33:15.799 --> 01:33:16.971
Where is she?

01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:18.305
Excuse me.

01:33:18.468 --> 01:33:20.345
Landri, what happened?

01:33:20.512 --> 01:33:22.185
She had an accident.

01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:25.016
Nobody's looking for her?

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:26.768
Malia!

01:33:27.852 --> 01:33:29.320
Malia!

01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:31.068
(WHIMPERING)

01:33:33.983 --> 01:33:35.326
Malia?

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:38.120
Oh, bug.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:40.050
She wouldn't give
me the bathroom pass.

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:41.537
Oh, no, sweetie.

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:43.619
I simply told
her that big girls

01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:45.290
wait until
the appropriate time.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:48.047
You punished her because she
had to go to the bathroom?

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:51.335
DEBORAH: I punished her because, like
her mother, she cannot follow rules.

01:33:51.501 --> 01:33:53.048
Girls her age need
an example of how...

01:33:53.211 --> 01:33:54.804
Rules about...
Are you insane?

01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:56.715
Let me go!

01:33:59.134 --> 01:34:00.431
This is all your fault.

01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:02.512
It's all my fault, is it?
You make everything bad.

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:04.435
I make everything bad.
Sticking me here,

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:06.107
where I'm never
gonna learn anything.

01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:08.480
Don't talk to me like that!
So I can end up like you?

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.562
Like what?
Poor and dumb!

01:34:14.232 --> 01:34:16.576
Did you hear me?
You're stupid!

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:51.019
Go take your jeans off.
There you go.

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:08.374
RISKE: <i> The thing is,
you can't go back.</i>

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:11.460
For those of you who
have given up on us,

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:15.965
you've given up on us.

01:35:16.586 --> 01:35:19.089
You won't have the
union to protect you.

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:22.760
Now, I don't know if it's
been made clear to you,

01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:26.976
but supporting this new school
does not necessarily mean

01:35:27.138 --> 01:35:29.937
you'll be signing
a contract to teach there.

01:35:30.099 --> 01:35:33.228
Even if you are hired,
there are no guarantees.

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:35.522
That's what's been happening
all over the country

01:35:35.605 --> 01:35:37.232
with these kinds of schools.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:40.569
Six months later they're failing,
and people are out of a job.

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:43.614
So, what really worries me
is human nature.

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.748
It's human nature to be afraid.

01:35:45.907 --> 01:35:48.911
And we've got administrators at
other schools who are afraid.

01:35:49.077 --> 01:35:52.832
They're afraid of the same thing
happening at their schools.

01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:55.793
And they're telling us

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:58.090
they don't want to hire the
teachers who got all this started.

01:35:58.253 --> 01:35:59.675
'Scuse me.
'Scuse me, please.

01:35:59.754 --> 01:36:01.176
Yes, Breena.
'Scuse me.

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:04.266
So basically what
you're telling us

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:07.679
is if we go along
with this "takeover"

01:36:07.845 --> 01:36:09.438
TAP will blacklist us.

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:11.019
No, that's not what I'm saying.

01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:14.686
I'm saying we can't guarantee
how other schools might react.

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:19.525
Is this confusing? I mean,
does this make sense?

01:36:19.691 --> 01:36:22.615
No, no, it does not.
It doesn't make sense.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:26.532
Sorry about that, Michael. How
can I elucidate this for you?

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:30.326
I'm a member of this union.
Great.

01:36:30.493 --> 01:36:32.211
And I'm also a human.

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:36.799
And I'm sorry, I just don't agree
with your view of human nature

01:36:36.958 --> 01:36:40.462
about your assessment
of our humanity.

01:36:40.545 --> 01:36:43.765
I'm not afraid, and the teachers
that I know, we're not fearful.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:46.810
In fact, the teachers that
I know are bold at heart

01:36:46.884 --> 01:36:50.058
and they want change because it's
what's best for our students.

01:36:50.221 --> 01:36:52.644
And what we've been
lacking is leadership.

01:36:54.225 --> 01:36:56.023
Well, guess what?

01:36:57.312 --> 01:36:58.689
We found some.

01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:05.866
Holland saw me come in,
so I just have a minute.

01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:07.413
Here's the thing.

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:09.661
We're all scared of something.

01:37:09.824 --> 01:37:12.828
I'm scared of things staying the
same, you're scared of things not.

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:15.998
This is what we're giving the board.
This is your school.

01:37:16.164 --> 01:37:17.586
Standardized
test study programs

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:19.171
integrating
competitive hip-hop,

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:20.547
that's Breena's idea.

01:37:20.710 --> 01:37:23.839
Community outreach programs and service
field trips, that's Michael's.

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:24.922
Thattagirl.

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:29.386
Fifth graders reading and acting
Shakespeare, that's Ben's.

01:37:29.552 --> 01:37:31.930
Nona, none of this means
anything if we can't teach.

01:37:32.096 --> 01:37:33.848
You will teach.
You'll teach here.

01:37:34.015 --> 01:37:35.813
Look what they did to you.

01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:37.776
Yeah. They did.

01:37:38.603 --> 01:37:41.197
And it's true
that having your kids

01:37:41.314 --> 01:37:43.942
taken from you
just about kills you.

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:48.788
But it's worse for the kids.

01:37:49.447 --> 01:37:53.452
And it's them, the kids, that
I'm tryin' to think about.

01:37:53.618 --> 01:37:55.120
Just them now.

01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:56.913
You get what I'm saying?

01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.957
Security is on its way.

01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:01.125
Yeah? You gonna arrest me?

01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:02.544
You betcha.

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:07.056
That's one good thing
about bein' out of a job.

01:38:07.215 --> 01:38:08.637
You don't have to
worry about getting fired

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:11.139
when you tell your boss
to go screw himself.

01:38:11.302 --> 01:38:12.474
Read the future.

01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:16.982
All right,
just so everybody's clear...

01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:18.643
BREENA: 'Scuse me.

01:38:20.645 --> 01:38:22.318
This room is for teachers.

01:38:30.822 --> 01:38:32.449
Seventeen

01:38:32.698 --> 01:38:33.824
plus one

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:35.709
is eighteen.

01:38:35.868 --> 01:38:38.166
They're all still with us.

01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:46.800
Let's celebrate.

01:38:47.171 --> 01:38:49.173
Hearing in two days.

01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:54.679
Hey.

Have you heard of colic?

No.

It's something that babies
get and nobody knows why.

But it makes you cry
for hours and hours.

01:41:09.313 --> 01:41:14.069
And when you have a colicky baby,
you just have to deal with it.

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:16.491
And a lot of good mothers can.

One night,
you were crying real hard

01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:25.079
and I had a little wine.

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.707
More than a little.

01:41:29.709 --> 01:41:33.339
And then it got worse, so I decided
to take you to the doctor.

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:35.757

someone, but I didn't.

Really bad.

More people
found out about this

01:41:47.435 --> 01:41:49.403
and they might
say something to you

01:41:49.562 --> 01:41:51.610
and I want you to
know the words to say.

Bad things.

I mean, bad.

she get a school when

she hadn't done it.

She wishes it
with all her heart.

01:42:13.127 --> 01:42:15.095
Because she loves her son.

01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:17.882
And that she's sorry.

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:24.229
But it was a mistake

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:25.389

I forgot to click it

and you were
thrown from your seat.

01:42:54.919 --> 01:42:59.470
And they thought that maybe
it had got to your brain.

And that's the thing that's been
taking hold of me all these years.

01:43:04.929 --> 01:43:08.354
That maybe it had.

01:43:11.769 --> 01:43:13.112
And I'm sorry.

01:43:18.275 --> 01:43:19.993
But it didn't.

that the petition submitted by
Ms. Alberts and Ms. Fitzpatrick

01:46:26.463 --> 01:46:27.635

divulge that information.

the intended number

was 134, not 431,000.

Please, go ahead,
Ms. Fitzpatrick.

01:48:25.708 --> 01:48:31.010

because I flipped the numbers

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:36.261
one time in this whole proposal,
because I'm dyslexic.

I never even said that word
when I was my daughter's age

01:48:43.934 --> 01:48:46.687
because the school I went
to made me feel dumb.

01:48:46.854 --> 01:48:50.108
And they didn't do anything about
it, they just passed me through.

Do any of you even remember
what we're doin' here?

01:49:21.722 --> 01:49:25.477
Because we're
not here for this.

We're not here for unions
and teachers and parents.

01:49:30.689 --> 01:49:33.408
We're here for our kids.

01:49:33.692 --> 01:49:36.536
And me and all of these
teachers and parents,

01:49:36.695 --> 01:49:40.541
we didn't go through all this
to get turned down for a typo.

01:49:40.699 --> 01:49:43.919
Now I know

01:49:44.286 --> 01:49:47.381
you're gonna find any reason you
can to turn this school down

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.793
and that it doesn't
really matter what we do.

01:49:53.128 --> 01:49:54.926
But even so,

of this magnitude.

be professionals.

creating more incentives

01:52:07.429 --> 01:52:10.057
and more protection
for them, not less.
