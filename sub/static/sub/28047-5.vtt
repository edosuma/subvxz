WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:09.150
We're under a ton of pressure
right now,

00:09.170 --> 00:11.000
so we're setting up
a security business.

00:11.020 --> 00:13.170
We have a backer
who will front startup costs.

00:13.190 --> 00:15.100
-Who?
-The cartel.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.150
I need you
as the face of this business

00:23.170 --> 00:25.020
because I can't get out from
under

00:25.060 --> 00:26.080
this shit without you.

00:26.100 --> 00:27.090
Steve thinks that you
can be an asset.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.050
You're willing to share
information

00:29.090 --> 00:30.070
with my father?

00:30.090 --> 00:32.190
If I'm properly incentivized.

00:32.210 --> 00:34.020
They trust you yet?

00:34.040 --> 00:35.140
They don't even
trust each other.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.130
It's about time I meet
these people myself.

00:37.150 --> 00:39.110
Start laying track for an intro.

00:39.130 --> 00:41.100
The name Abigail Beach
mean anything to you?

00:41.120 --> 00:42.160
She says you raped her.

00:42.180 --> 00:44.060
I never raped anybody.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.180
I'm not letting this go
until I know the truth.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.120
I'm filing for full custody.

00:47.140 --> 00:50.090
Burn my house down, Victor,
and I'll burn down yours.

00:50.110 --> 00:52.050
You're just as dirty as I am.

00:53.170 --> 00:54.200
It's from her.

01:01.020 --> 01:03.130
G's makin' moves, and I'm losin'
brothers.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.160
Get rid of his ass,
keep the peace.

01:08.070 --> 01:09.110
I know this kid.

01:09.130 --> 01:12.010
Someone saw the shooting.
It was G.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.010
-Get your hands up, G.
-So you takin' me in?

01:14.030 --> 01:15.010
Yeah.

01:15.190 --> 01:17.090
I hear you like to talk.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.120
So let's talk.

02:36.230 --> 02:39.040
You almost brought the cops
to our doorstep.

02:39.060 --> 02:41.090
Overconfidence is a weakness.

02:41.110 --> 02:43.010
Don't chance it next time.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.030
Get the VIN swapped out,
put it with the others.

02:49.010 --> 02:50.130
Why are the Colombians here?

02:50.150 --> 02:53.040
They need a way to get their
product into Vancouver.

02:53.190 --> 02:55.000
You gettin' in the
dope business?

02:55.020 --> 02:56.220
If the money's right, why not?

03:41.050 --> 03:42.050
What?

03:42.070 --> 03:44.230
What the hell were you thinking,
arresting G?

03:47.090 --> 03:49.050
I was thinking that
he's a killer.

03:50.010 --> 03:54.150
And I'm a cop, and it is my job
to haul his ass in, Steve.

03:54.170 --> 03:56.120
The charge won't stick.

03:58.110 --> 04:00.000
And when he gets out,
it's gonna make things worse.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.180
What's worse than letting him
gun down kids, Steve?

04:06.050 --> 04:08.010
Man, what the fuck are we?

04:08.220 --> 04:11.030
Listen, a turf war...

04:12.030 --> 04:14.190
is gonna pull focus
from what we're trying to do.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.090
We who?

04:17.110 --> 04:19.160
Don't play stupid. The Ravens.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.170
I'm trying to get us to
a safe place,

04:23.190 --> 04:26.150
and you, little brother,
are screwing it up.

04:27.130 --> 04:29.140
We are cops, Steve.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.140
And we have forgotten that shit.

04:51.170 --> 04:52.210
I'm coming.

04:56.100 --> 04:58.090
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:58.110 --> 04:59.120
Can we talk?

05:00.170 --> 05:01.180
About?

05:02.090 --> 05:03.100
Us.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.190
Yeah, can I come inside?

05:10.090 --> 05:12.110
Okay, um...

05:13.070 --> 05:15.080
I'm not gonna fight you
over custody.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.200
Why the change of heart?

05:20.060 --> 05:21.210
Guess I'm tired of fighting.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.190
So, I can see Veronica
away from Victor's house?

05:36.130 --> 05:38.030
Look, it's not what you think.

05:38.050 --> 05:39.150
Right. Okay.

05:39.170 --> 05:41.130
Hey, I loved you.

05:41.150 --> 05:43.010
I still love you.

05:46.150 --> 05:47.150
Okay.

06:12.180 --> 06:14.080
Nobody got killed, did they?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.080
Not this time.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.110
But what about the next time,
or the time after that?

06:18.130 --> 06:19.230
Why you comin' at me?

06:20.010 --> 06:21.090
I had nothing to do with this.

06:21.110 --> 06:23.070
-That's on G.
-G's in jail.

06:23.090 --> 06:25.110
Shooters ain't.

06:25.130 --> 06:26.180
When you gonna arrest them?

06:26.200 --> 06:28.110
When we can prove they did this?

06:28.130 --> 06:30.060
-You know they did this.
-Knowing ain't provin'...

06:30.080 --> 06:32.040
...because if it was,
you'd be in the next cell.

06:32.060 --> 06:35.130
How long you think you gonna be
able to keep G on the inside?

06:35.170 --> 06:36.000
Hmm?

06:36.020 --> 06:38.090
It's a cover. You know it.

06:38.110 --> 06:40.030
Surprised he ain't out now.

06:40.050 --> 06:43.140
Clinton, this has to stop.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.020
Now, one of you-- you or G--
is going to lose.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.120
Now, how many people gotta die
before that happens? Huh?

06:48.140 --> 06:50.200
-This is my turf, man.
-Until it's not.

06:50.220 --> 06:52.160
Back off, man.

06:52.180 --> 06:56.140
Y'all really think that me
giving up my corners--

06:56.160 --> 06:58.150
my  corners--

06:58.170 --> 07:00.080
really gonna solve anything?

07:00.100 --> 07:01.200
Lives, son.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.210
Lives lost, versus lives saved.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.030
That mean anything to you?

07:15.100 --> 07:16.200
But if they're sending
mixed signals,

07:16.220 --> 07:19.060
how are we supposed to know
what they want or don't want?

07:19.080 --> 07:21.040
You could try paying attention
to something

07:21.060 --> 07:23.040
besides what you want.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.080
That was a reasonable question.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.200
That was a reasonable answer!

07:25.220 --> 07:28.120
Can we agree that it's
a minefield for both parties?

07:29.120 --> 07:31.160
Doesn't have to be that way.

07:31.180 --> 07:35.010
There's a retro solution:
Get to know each other

07:35.030 --> 07:37.060
before you decide whether or not
you want to have sex.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.080
Fewer misunderstandings
that way.

07:41.140 --> 07:43.200
And less of a risk of something
coming back to bite you.

07:43.220 --> 07:45.130
It bites you anyway.

07:45.150 --> 07:46.210
See, I got called by
the Committee

07:46.230 --> 07:48.230
'cause some girl complained
I stared at her chest.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.020
Oh, my God.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.020
Did you?

07:51.040 --> 07:53.110
Hell, yeah.
She was, like, a 42D.

07:53.130 --> 07:55.080
How are you supposed
to look away?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.140
Sometimes I think we should
limit this class to men...

07:57.160 --> 08:00.160
since you're the ones who seem
to need the education.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.090
Ooh, burn.

08:14.170 --> 08:15.180
Can I help you?

08:15.200 --> 08:17.090
Yeah, I-I know it's late,

08:17.110 --> 08:19.220
but, uh, I had a meeting earlier
with the building supervisor.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.180
I forgot to give him something.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.150
Him and his people around still?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.010
No.

08:26.220 --> 08:28.040
Property's closed for the night.

08:28.060 --> 08:29.120
Try again tomorrow.

08:29.140 --> 08:32.030
-DEA. Hands where I can see 'em!
-What the hell's going on?

08:34.050 --> 08:36.200
Everybody chill the hell out.
I'm an off-duty cop.

08:36.220 --> 08:38.130
When the place is secure,
you can show me your badge,

08:38.150 --> 08:41.010
but until then, get your
hands on the car.

08:44.160 --> 08:46.170
We're clear up front.
Move around back.

09:01.170 --> 09:03.040
Shit.

09:12.180 --> 09:14.020
Shit!

09:20.170 --> 09:21.170
Yeah, Pete?

09:21.190 --> 09:23.050
Hey, we got a serious fucking
problem

09:23.090 --> 09:24.190
with this new venture of yours.

09:43.230 --> 09:46.070
- What happened?
- DEA.

09:46.090 --> 09:48.060
From what my guys are saying,
this ain't the only place they

09:48.100 --> 09:48.150
hit.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.170
How many?

09:49.190 --> 09:51.000
All of 'em.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.010
And they perp-walked Carl
out of here.

09:54.030 --> 09:55.180
He looked pissed.

09:57.140 --> 09:58.150
Shit!

10:15.050 --> 10:16.110
Thought this side of the
business

10:16.150 --> 10:17.180
was supposed to be legit.

10:21.180 --> 10:22.220
It is.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.190
I don't know why they
hit the jobsites.

10:24.210 --> 10:26.130
So what now?

10:26.150 --> 10:28.170
'Cause those were my people
that were swept up in these

10:28.220 --> 10:29.050
raids.

10:29.070 --> 10:31.030
I promise, they're not stupid
enough

10:31.070 --> 10:32.200
to incriminate themselves.

10:32.220 --> 10:35.100
My lawyer will have them out
by day's end.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.040
What aren't you telling me?

10:38.220 --> 10:40.200
They also hit some money houses

10:40.220 --> 10:44.050
that only some of my father's
top lieutenants were privy to.

10:45.010 --> 10:47.160
What, so someone high up
is feeding them information?

10:47.180 --> 10:49.030
Exactly.

10:50.110 --> 10:52.160
I'll call Price, see if
she can make some inquiries.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.020
Yeah, I already called her.

10:56.010 --> 10:58.050
She's not answering her cell.

10:59.080 --> 11:01.060
Does that sound like a
coincidence to you?

11:01.150 --> 11:03.180
Where's your father right now?

11:03.200 --> 11:04.200
Safe.

11:04.220 --> 11:06.190
And until we find where
this leak is coming from,

11:06.210 --> 11:08.210
I don't trust anyone.

11:08.230 --> 11:10.040
Including you.

11:17.220 --> 11:19.220
I wouldn't put it past Price
to double-cross the cartel.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.120
If it was her, what the hell's
she got planned for us?

11:21.140 --> 11:22.200
It's not her.
She didn't know where

11:23.010 --> 11:24.060
Ignacio's money houses were.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.070
If it was her or wasn't,

11:26.090 --> 11:28.040
the DEA has their hands
around the cartel's throat,

11:28.060 --> 11:29.100
and it's just a matter of time
before

11:29.140 --> 11:30.190
our connection to them comes up.

11:30.210 --> 11:32.060
He's right.
We need an exit strategy.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.170
Yeah, smart move,
letting her back into our world.

11:34.190 --> 11:36.190
There's nothing we've done
that they can pin on us.

11:41.180 --> 11:42.200
Where are they?

11:42.220 --> 11:45.030
-Hmm?
-They're here somewhere.

11:45.050 --> 11:46.170
There's no one here.

11:46.190 --> 11:47.230
Okay.

11:48.010 --> 11:49.100
As long as we keep
our heads down

11:49.120 --> 11:51.200
like I been telling everyone to,
we'll be fine.

11:51.220 --> 11:55.000
Just because you say it out loud
doesn't mean it's true.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.100
I'll find Price
and get the answers we need.

12:06.060 --> 12:07.130
I need a drink.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.200
What the fuck?

12:20.220 --> 12:22.150
I'm taxing the Ravens
for what we're losing,

12:22.170 --> 12:24.200
'cause that asshole arrested G.

12:24.220 --> 12:26.090
Aw, hell no.

12:28.090 --> 12:29.190
Back up!

12:31.080 --> 12:33.040
Crack that piece of shit, Cole!

12:33.060 --> 12:34.070
Step back!

12:37.220 --> 12:39.220
Come on, Cole!

12:40.000 --> 12:41.110
Roll over, come on!

12:43.220 --> 12:44.220
Get him, Cole!

12:47.090 --> 12:48.160
Yeah, punk!

12:51.050 --> 12:52.130
Enough!

12:52.150 --> 12:54.050
Come on, come on!

12:56.170 --> 12:58.030
Get his ass up out of here!

12:58.050 --> 13:00.010
Don't come back.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.050
Move!

13:16.130 --> 13:18.200
- Hello?
- Pete.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.130
Something's going on.

13:20.150 --> 13:21.150
What are you talking about?

13:21.170 --> 13:24.030
I don't know, my dad
seems nervous.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.060
The people that he's meeting
with

13:27.100 --> 13:28.100
are very angry.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.070
There have already
been some fights.

13:31.090 --> 13:34.000
It's not a safe place
for Veronica right now.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.070
Bring her to me.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.110
Back up.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.040
Price?

14:26.060 --> 14:28.070
She can't come to the
phone right now,

14:28.210 --> 14:30.170
but maybe I can help.

14:53.020 --> 14:54.070
Where is she?

14:59.060 --> 15:00.070
Carmen?

15:03.060 --> 15:05.000
Your brother has Price.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.020
What are you talking about?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.140
He's running his own program,
and Price is gonna help him do

15:09.180 --> 15:09.230
it.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.060
No, no, no. There's no way.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.030
Did Ricardo know about each of
the stash houses the DEA took

15:14.070 --> 15:14.150
down?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.040
Yeah.

15:17.060 --> 15:18.160
Then do the math.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.190
Mm.

15:25.140 --> 15:28.080
My brother's an idiot.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.180
Just never thought he'd do
something this stupid.

15:32.130 --> 15:35.110
Maybe he's not as dumb
as you think he is.

15:40.030 --> 15:41.180
I have to tell my father this.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.020
Love you so much.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.040
Love you.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.110
-Love you.
-Okay.

16:14.130 --> 16:15.140
Daddy!

16:16.170 --> 16:17.170
You okay?

16:17.190 --> 16:18.200
Yeah.

16:20.100 --> 16:21.110
Bye!

16:32.020 --> 16:33.210
It's good to finally have
you home again.

16:38.140 --> 16:41.030
It's a good thing Mom
hasn't seen this.

16:41.050 --> 16:42.200
Come on, it's not that bad.

16:42.220 --> 16:44.070
Yes, it is.

16:46.150 --> 16:48.170
Whatever. Put your stuff away,
I'll make you something to eat.

16:48.190 --> 16:49.200
Okay.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.080
Wait, what?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.100
Nothing.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.230
No, you have that look
in your eyes.

17:05.010 --> 17:06.030
What look?

17:06.050 --> 17:08.130
-That look! No, unh-unh.
-Which one?

17:08.150 --> 17:11.080
I'm not doing it.
Ain't gonna fall for that.

17:13.030 --> 17:15.030
Oh. There you go.

17:16.110 --> 17:17.120
Are you sure?

17:19.150 --> 17:22.070
God!

17:22.090 --> 17:24.030
It's better to sacrifice your
rook

17:24.070 --> 17:26.000
than to lose a queen, Daddy.

17:26.020 --> 17:27.030
Yeah, right?

17:27.170 --> 17:29.100
I'm never gonna get this game,
am I?

17:29.120 --> 17:30.150
You're okay, but you shouldn't
let

17:30.190 --> 17:31.230
the other player pressure you

17:32.010 --> 17:33.160
into making a bad move.

17:36.010 --> 17:37.040
How old are you again?

17:43.160 --> 17:45.160
You can answer it. I don't mind.

17:51.030 --> 17:53.030
Hey, didn't you just tell me

17:53.050 --> 17:55.130
not to let people rush me
into making bad moves?

18:00.150 --> 18:01.150
Go.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.210
You have Ramos.
Leave a message.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.030
You good?

18:27.120 --> 18:29.120
Deal with him while I
talk to Victor.

18:31.170 --> 18:32.220
Victor...

18:49.200 --> 18:51.170
I'm sorry
about all this.

18:51.190 --> 18:52.190
If I thought there was a chance
you

18:52.230 --> 18:54.080
were gonna get swept up in their
shit,

18:54.100 --> 18:56.020
I never would have involved you,
man.

18:56.220 --> 18:59.180
I am a grown-ass man, Steve.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.130
I knew what I was gettin' into.

19:31.030 --> 19:32.200
Here's the thing:

19:32.220 --> 19:34.190
I trust you.

19:34.210 --> 19:36.200
Those cartel idiots,
not so much.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.020
Yeah, I get it.

19:39.020 --> 19:40.020
Do you?

19:41.040 --> 19:42.100
Hey, look at me.

19:44.090 --> 19:45.080
You know what your problem is?

19:46.170 --> 19:48.200
Even if I did, it's obvious
you want to tell me.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.190
You and your dad are the same.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.150
Yeah, see, and you always
think you're gonna win,

19:55.170 --> 19:57.190
no matter how bad the odds are.

19:59.080 --> 20:03.130
You're right. That's why
I need someone like you,

20:04.100 --> 20:06.060
to tell me the hard truths,

20:06.080 --> 20:09.050
so together we can figure out
a different way to win.

20:09.190 --> 20:12.130
I've already paid my dues
as far as the Ravens go.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.090
I just want to go back
and work the bar.

20:15.230 --> 20:18.020
Carl, I'm dead fuckin' serious.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.160
I want a way out.

20:20.180 --> 20:23.180
Help me build this business
into something legitimate.

20:27.180 --> 20:31.000
When you say that,
I honestly think you believe it.

20:31.020 --> 20:34.150
But the truth is, you love
the chaos of this world,

20:34.170 --> 20:37.080
and if I try to help you, man,
you're just gonna pull me back

20:37.130 --> 20:37.230
into it.

21:07.130 --> 21:10.040
How do you think your father's
gonna react to this?

21:11.050 --> 21:12.150
I have no idea.

21:14.020 --> 21:16.050
My father's a cruel man
when he has to be.

21:16.070 --> 21:18.230
But, when it comes to Ricardo,

21:19.010 --> 21:20.020
he's weak.

21:21.060 --> 21:23.090
Fathers and their sons.

21:23.110 --> 21:25.180
That ain't an easy relationship.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
Yeah.

21:29.140 --> 21:31.180
Our fathers have
a lot in common, don't they?

21:31.200 --> 21:34.200
Yeah. None of it good.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.080
You ever think about just...

21:41.120 --> 21:42.170
breaking the cycle?

21:45.190 --> 21:47.090
I like to think I have.

21:47.110 --> 21:49.140
Yeah.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.210
Me too.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.020
Yet here we are.

21:59.030 --> 22:01.080
Your father's being babysat
by the Indians?

22:01.100 --> 22:02.230
Until I know who's loyal to my
father

22:03.030 --> 22:04.140
and who works for my brother,

22:04.160 --> 22:06.070
they're the only ones
I can trust.

22:10.070 --> 22:11.070
Let me get your cell phones.

22:11.090 --> 22:13.230
Nothing that gives off a signal
goes beyond this point.

22:14.010 --> 22:15.210
Your father's orders.

22:15.230 --> 22:18.060
-Give him your cell phone.
-And your gun.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.160
Son of a bitch.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I don't believe it.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.130
I know my son.

22:42.150 --> 22:44.210
He is a coward--
a violent one, but a coward.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.140
He would not do this.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.230
It's that ex-FBI agent,

22:49.010 --> 22:51.060
that woman you brought
into our lives.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.020
She's working with your son.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.010
Not willingly.

22:57.050 --> 23:01.210
Papa,  por favor,  listen to him.

23:03.010 --> 23:04.160
Ricardo wants you dead.

23:09.060 --> 23:11.140
I blame you for the
damage she's caused.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.180
Ricardo's the problem,
not Steve.

23:13.200 --> 23:16.070
Don't defend him on this.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.190
I will talk to my son.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.130
Get your ass in there!

23:22.150 --> 23:24.180
Move your fucking ass!
Just keep walking!

23:33.050 --> 23:34.150
He followed you here.

23:35.220 --> 23:37.010
He had this on him.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.000
This man works for me?

23:50.090 --> 23:54.000
No. He works for your son.

24:11.220 --> 24:13.020
He would have talked.

24:20.020 --> 24:23.090
You shot him because you don't
want to hear the truth, do you?

24:24.050 --> 24:27.190
That your son is a traitor.

24:27.210 --> 24:29.210
-If that were true--
-If?

24:30.020 --> 24:31.070
If?

24:31.090 --> 24:33.050
Wake up.

24:33.070 --> 24:35.000
Your son is at war with you.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.080
What are you gonna do about it?

24:37.200 --> 24:40.160
I will talk to him,
face to face.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.230
That's a bad idea.

24:42.010 --> 24:43.160
He doesn't seem like the
reasonable type.

24:43.180 --> 24:45.050
Listen, this place is burned.

24:45.070 --> 24:46.150
-We need to move.
-Where?

24:47.090 --> 24:48.140
Colombia.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.040
I will go home.

24:50.190 --> 24:53.010
There are people there
I still trust.

25:07.030 --> 25:08.180
You called, I'm here.

25:08.220 --> 25:10.010
What's up?

25:12.090 --> 25:14.120
I know someone
that witnessed the shooting.

25:16.150 --> 25:18.160
Somebody who says it was G?

25:19.060 --> 25:20.170
Yes.

25:20.190 --> 25:22.050
You gonna give me a name?

25:25.110 --> 25:26.170
It's a child.

25:26.190 --> 25:29.150
Shit.

25:29.230 --> 25:32.100
Look, anybody who comes
forward is dead.

25:32.220 --> 25:35.000
We can't do that to a kid,
Amber.

25:35.020 --> 25:36.130
That's what I told him.

25:37.150 --> 25:39.030
He wants to.

25:40.030 --> 25:42.000
He idolized Barry.

25:59.150 --> 26:01.030
You should get that.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.120
Yo, what's up?

26:09.140 --> 26:11.090
Shit's going south, and you
decide

26:11.130 --> 26:12.230
to take a personal day.

26:13.010 --> 26:14.150
Calm down. I got Veronica.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.100
I need your head in the game,
Pete.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.120
Hold on.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.200
-Tell me what happens, all
right?

26:19.000 --> 26:19.140
-Okay, fine.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.090
All right, what do you need?

26:22.110 --> 26:24.190
Carmen wants to move Ignacio.

26:24.210 --> 26:27.090
Their family reunion
turned into World War III,

26:27.110 --> 26:29.200
and Ricardo's behind
the whole mess.

26:29.220 --> 26:32.040
Why get involved?
Let them handle that shit.

26:32.060 --> 26:34.070
Nah, we're in too deep
to back out now.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.060
Meet me in an hour.

26:57.070 --> 26:59.000
Got a minute?

26:59.020 --> 27:00.110
You got a problem?

27:01.060 --> 27:02.220
Yeah.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.060
A witness that saw G kill Barry.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.050
And why is that a problem?

27:07.070 --> 27:09.100
Now you can re-arrest
that piece of shit.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.160
Re-arrest?

27:13.200 --> 27:15.200
Got kicked out about an hour
ago.

27:16.000 --> 27:16.190
No charges.

27:17.230 --> 27:20.120
So... we gotta go get him?

27:21.120 --> 27:22.220
Want some company?

27:23.140 --> 27:25.120
I'm up for cracking some heads.

27:28.190 --> 27:30.100
The witness is nine years old.

27:31.170 --> 27:33.180
I don't want to put a
target on his back.

27:36.010 --> 27:37.040
Well, then, why bring up what
you've got

27:37.080 --> 27:38.060
if you're not gonna use it?

27:46.230 --> 27:48.220
Do you ever think
about what happened to us?

27:50.130 --> 27:52.110
Why aren't we cops anymore?

27:56.020 --> 27:57.230
Foster overthought that shit.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.160
Look where it got him.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.060
It's not a good time, Pete.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.230
I need you to do
something for me.

28:11.010 --> 28:12.150
Ravens business.

28:12.170 --> 28:14.030
I've been called
into the principal's office.

28:14.050 --> 28:15.140
I'm about to go in right now.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.210
Is Dani okay?

28:16.230 --> 28:18.210
I don't know what it's
about.

28:19.010 --> 28:20.050
Can I call you back?

28:20.070 --> 28:22.080
I need you to watch Veronica
for a few hours.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.160
Since when is babysitting

28:23.180 --> 28:24.230
Ravens business?

28:25.010 --> 28:26.040
Hell is breaking loose with the
cartel.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.070
Steve needs me to meet him.

28:27.090 --> 28:29.130
Look, would it help if I call it
a personal favor?

28:29.150 --> 28:32.060
We fucked once,
now I'm your substitute wife?

28:32.080 --> 28:33.190
If anybody should understand
what it's

28:33.230 --> 28:35.180
like juggling work and a kid,
it's you.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.070
All right. I'll call
you

28:37.110 --> 28:39.120
after I figure out what's going
on here.

28:39.140 --> 28:40.190
All right, thanks. Sounds good.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.130
Hey.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.230
Come on in.
Have a seat.

29:12.140 --> 29:13.170
I didn't tell her.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.230
Dani told her friend
that men with guns

29:19.010 --> 29:21.070
broke into your house
a few nights ago.

29:21.090 --> 29:23.090
The story made its way to me.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.230
Okay.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.210
Is the story true?

29:33.130 --> 29:35.010
Tell me what you heard.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.000
Two men,
south-of-the-border accents,

29:40.020 --> 29:42.070
threats, gunfire.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.190
It was a misunderstanding.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.200
Honey, could you wait outside?

30:10.140 --> 30:12.150
The child is terrified.

30:12.170 --> 30:15.170
Now, is she afraid of those men,
or you?

30:18.090 --> 30:19.100
Our parents are dead.

30:21.030 --> 30:22.230
There's nothing I
wouldn't do for Dani.

30:23.010 --> 30:26.000
That might be true, but you're
dancing around the issue.

30:28.220 --> 30:31.180
Do you want to lay out for me
what you think the issue is?

30:32.060 --> 30:34.170
I would think it
would be obvious.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.070
I'm going to have the Department
of

30:39.110 --> 30:41.060
Children's Services do a home
check.

30:46.060 --> 30:48.110
Seriously? The principal?

30:48.130 --> 30:50.140
I told my friend, not her.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.220
We talked about this.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.200
You're not supposed
to tell anyone.

30:53.220 --> 30:56.210
It wasn't normal. People died.
I was scared.

31:02.130 --> 31:04.080
I'm sorry.
I know it's hard, but you

31:04.120 --> 31:06.100
should have kept your mouth
shut.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.010
Hey.

31:32.110 --> 31:33.160
You're a poor judge of
character,

31:33.200 --> 31:34.120
you know that?

31:34.140 --> 31:36.210
What's wrong with showing you
you're important to us?

31:36.230 --> 31:38.060
Well, you can't just buy me off.

31:41.060 --> 31:43.140
We already talked about this.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.110
This relationship you got with
the cartel,

31:45.150 --> 31:46.170
it's gonna end badly.

31:46.190 --> 31:47.220
I don't want to be one of the
meat shields

31:48.020 --> 31:48.150
when it happens.

31:48.170 --> 31:50.060
We're only using 'em until we
get

31:50.100 --> 31:51.130
the company started.

31:51.150 --> 31:53.060
Once we get big enough,
we walk away.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.060
No, wake up, they're
not gonna let us walk away.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.190
I think they will.

31:59.220 --> 32:02.200
For this company to survive,

32:02.220 --> 32:05.080
I need someone I can
trust running it.

32:08.030 --> 32:10.080
We're gonna end up
on the wrong side of this.

32:10.180 --> 32:12.170
I don't want to go
to jail again.

32:14.010 --> 32:15.020
Who does?

32:17.220 --> 32:20.160
If we're gonna do this--
I mean  really  do this--

32:20.180 --> 32:21.210
it's on my terms.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.230
Okay. What are those?

32:23.010 --> 32:25.230
Pull back from everything to do
with the cartel except outside

32:26.030 --> 32:26.160
security.

32:30.030 --> 32:31.030
Deal.

32:59.220 --> 33:01.050
You wanna talk?

33:02.120 --> 33:03.150
Let's talk.

33:08.060 --> 33:09.060
Take those.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.180
Hey, come on.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.210
You made this?

33:26.230 --> 33:28.090
She did.

33:29.110 --> 33:31.090
I don't get to cook very often,
sweetie.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.110
There's not a lot in the fridge.

33:33.130 --> 33:35.050
No shit. It's mostly beer.

33:35.070 --> 33:37.010
Watch your mouth!

33:39.150 --> 33:41.090
My dad's a terrible cook.

33:41.110 --> 33:43.020
We eat out a lot.

33:52.050 --> 33:54.160
My mom says he's dating.
Is it you?

33:59.190 --> 34:00.190
Not like that.

34:00.210 --> 34:02.190
-They're dating.
-Dani, so help me--

34:02.210 --> 34:04.170
It's true.

34:09.060 --> 34:11.100
-How do you like your school?
-It's all right.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.000
Do you like my dad?

34:19.010 --> 34:20.020
I do.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.200
I should probably get that.

34:33.020 --> 34:34.030
Mommy!

34:38.110 --> 34:40.190
-I missed you!
-I missed you too.

34:41.070 --> 34:42.080
Brought a bag.

34:59.050 --> 35:00.060
Thanks.

35:04.220 --> 35:07.080
I met your mother in a bar.

35:07.100 --> 35:11.000
We slept together once,
consensually.

35:11.020 --> 35:14.070
So now you remember?
You had to dig for it?

35:17.020 --> 35:18.070
She filed a complaint.

35:18.210 --> 35:21.050
You were questioned,
investigated.

35:21.070 --> 35:23.170
That's not something that,
like, sticks to your mind?

35:23.190 --> 35:25.060
You blindsided me about
something

35:25.100 --> 35:27.010
I spent years trying to forget.

35:27.030 --> 35:28.120
I lied.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.080
Yeah. But about what?

35:33.150 --> 35:35.200
Remembering my mother,
or raping her?

35:35.220 --> 35:37.130
Remembering her.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.050
Being accused of something you
didn't do

35:39.090 --> 35:40.040
is a horrible experience.

35:40.060 --> 35:42.020
You dredged it back up.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.090
Well, I was reflexive.
I'm sorry.

35:45.090 --> 35:48.090
It was thirty-odd years ago.
I was-- I was in college.

35:49.110 --> 35:51.160
Guys that age are
walking hard-ons.

35:51.180 --> 35:54.140
I-I slept with damn near
any girl who was willing.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.080
Willing. That is the issue here.

36:01.130 --> 36:03.130
I'll take a polygraph
test if you want.

36:08.140 --> 36:10.140
Maybe a DNA test first.

36:11.140 --> 36:14.000
No use saddling you with this
if you're not the one.

36:14.140 --> 36:17.000
Karen, if I'm your father,
I want to know.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.040
Look, I did not rape
your mother.

36:41.070 --> 36:43.130
I gotta give you props
for showing up here alone.

36:44.150 --> 36:46.090
What's to stop me
from killing you?

36:46.230 --> 36:48.120
You got it coming,

36:48.140 --> 36:50.160
messing with me like that.

36:50.180 --> 36:52.050
You're not stupid.

36:52.070 --> 36:54.160
Killing a cop's bad
for business.

36:54.180 --> 36:56.190
Cops are bad for business
any way you look at it.

36:58.130 --> 36:59.200
You called me.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.150
So, what you want?

37:02.140 --> 37:03.170
Me, you and Clinton.

37:03.190 --> 37:06.000
We get together
and hammer out a truce, man.

37:06.020 --> 37:07.130
He gonna give back his corners?

37:07.150 --> 37:09.120
Don't know till we talk.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.130
No.

37:13.150 --> 37:15.150
It's easier just to
shove his ass out.

37:16.150 --> 37:18.060
There's a witness,

37:18.080 --> 37:20.130
says you pulled the trigger, G.

37:22.010 --> 37:24.160
If you had a witness,
I'd still be in jail.

37:24.180 --> 37:25.180
Bad bluff.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.160
Oh, it's not a bluff.

37:27.180 --> 37:29.050
I just don't want to put this
person

37:29.090 --> 37:30.090
in your sights, man.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.220
I'd rather find a way to end
the bloodshed

37:33.000 --> 37:34.190
without endangering hi--

37:36.020 --> 37:37.030
this person.

37:38.060 --> 37:40.020
Was that a-a-a him,

37:40.040 --> 37:41.190
or a her?

37:44.100 --> 37:45.150
Who is it?

37:47.110 --> 37:48.200
Willing to talk truce?

37:48.220 --> 37:50.030
No.

37:58.230 --> 38:00.040
Move.

38:15.220 --> 38:17.130
Ever been to Colombia?

38:18.030 --> 38:19.080
Can't say I have.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.010
You wouldn't last ten minutes.

38:21.030 --> 38:22.180
-You think so?
-I know so.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.220
Your heart is too soft.
That's a weakness where I come

38:25.020 --> 38:25.090
from.

38:25.110 --> 38:26.110
Is that right?

38:26.130 --> 38:29.180
You would survive,
until you open your damn mouth.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.090
Heads up!

38:32.110 --> 38:33.200
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey!

38:34.000 --> 38:35.110
I'm not here to kill anybody!

38:38.000 --> 38:40.150
Now, we can do this
any way you prefer.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.220
Ricardo would like a word
before you run back to Colombia.

39:19.050 --> 39:20.050
Reynaldo.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.060
You too, officer.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.230
Hey, you already got
what you came for.

40:02.030 --> 40:02.180
Don't push it.

40:09.140 --> 40:10.210
Ricardo wants him.

40:11.110 --> 40:14.040
It's okay.
Everything will be okay.

40:15.120 --> 40:17.030
Do as he says.

40:19.070 --> 40:20.100
Hold down the fort.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.100
If you don't hear from me
in 24 hours,

40:22.120 --> 40:24.120
hunt this bastard down
and kill him.
