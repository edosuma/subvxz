00:22.861 --> 00:24.397
Help!

00:24.529 --> 00:25.595
Help!!

00:42.247 --> 00:43.779
Hi. I'm Maxine, and I'm an addict.

00:43.814 --> 00:45.397
Hi, Maxine.

00:45.460 --> 00:48.350
I haven't taken a pill
in 19 months and 5 days.

00:50.889 --> 00:54.991
But, um... but this...

00:55.026 --> 00:57.659
These past six days
have been really rough.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.931
Someone died at work, and, uh...

01:05.436 --> 01:09.838
I just have to remember
that this, too, shall pass.

01:13.511 --> 01:14.710
Thanks for coming.

01:14.745 --> 01:16.745
You used that line on Naomi last night?

01:16.781 --> 01:18.547
You figured that out fast.

01:18.582 --> 01:21.717
I spotted you two playing
tonsil hockey in your office.

01:21.752 --> 01:23.285
Is she as good as I remember?

01:24.021 --> 01:25.521
As a lawyer, of course.

01:25.556 --> 01:27.856
New case for you... Leo Scarlata.

01:27.892 --> 01:29.925
15 years into a life sentence

01:29.960 --> 01:32.027
for torching his family's restaurant.

01:32.062 --> 01:34.396
The fire killed one man,
injured another.

01:34.431 --> 01:35.730
Arson... Frankie will enjoy that.

01:35.765 --> 01:38.533
I don't see how it warrants
special delivery.

01:38.568 --> 01:40.435
Defense wanted to argue
diminished capacity,

01:40.470 --> 01:43.671
and the judge didn't allow it,
despite Leo's IQ being only 73.

01:43.706 --> 01:46.174
- A significant cognitive impairment.
- That, it is.

01:46.209 --> 01:48.676
That's exactly the kind of defendant
that gets bulldozed by the system.

01:48.711 --> 01:50.345
- Right again.
- Facts about the case?

01:50.380 --> 01:51.579
Solid, but not rock solid.

01:51.614 --> 01:53.015
Well, send the files to my office.

01:53.040 --> 01:54.449
Just one more thing.

01:54.717 --> 01:56.551
Meet Paul Slatkin.

01:56.586 --> 01:59.053
He's making a documentary
about Leo's incarceration.

01:59.088 --> 02:01.655
And, hopefully, exoneration.
It's a pleasure meeting you.

02:02.624 --> 02:04.724
This is my cameraman... Simon.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.560
They'll be filming your investigation.

02:06.595 --> 02:07.894
I am not spending five days

02:07.930 --> 02:09.696
with these gadflies
following my every move.

02:09.731 --> 02:11.298
You will if you want to work the case.

02:11.334 --> 02:12.166
I can help.

02:12.201 --> 02:13.934
I've been filming Leo and his family

02:13.970 --> 02:15.002
for the past two years.

02:15.037 --> 02:17.938
I've interviewed him,
his attorneys, family members.

02:17.974 --> 02:19.573
I can give you access to all of them.

02:19.608 --> 02:21.708
Great! Then you can stay
the hell away from Leo and me.

02:21.743 --> 02:23.944
This will be great publicity
for the CIU.

02:23.980 --> 02:25.075
Do you have the release?

02:25.100 --> 02:27.574
After the Dan Harris interview meltdown,
why would you even risk this?

02:27.599 --> 02:30.450
This time, the only ass truly
on the line is Leo Scarlata's.

02:30.485 --> 02:31.884
Even at your most self-sabotaging,

02:31.919 --> 02:33.416
you'd never hurt someone like him.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.494
You are so calculating
and manipulative and...

02:41.529 --> 02:43.496
- Right?
- That too.

02:52.107 --> 02:53.739
They're gonna be here all week?

02:53.774 --> 02:55.841
You better get your roots done.

02:55.877 --> 02:57.943
You look like a Ken Doll with stubble.

02:57.979 --> 02:59.411
Get to it, already.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.013
Um, the prosecution argued

03:01.048 --> 03:03.749
that Leo snuck into
the restaurant at 3:00 A.M.,

03:03.784 --> 03:05.584
lit a rag, threw it in the deep fryer,

03:05.620 --> 03:07.085
- and walked away.
- Motive?

03:07.121 --> 03:08.787
Revenge. Leo was angry at his two...

03:09.557 --> 03:12.090
...brothers for demoting him
to the kitchen,

03:12.126 --> 03:14.092
for accidentally spilling
hot tea on a customer.

03:14.128 --> 03:15.995
Can you, uh, close that?

03:16.030 --> 03:17.530
The... The glare is kind of...

03:17.565 --> 03:19.431
Blinding? Who knew?

03:19.466 --> 03:20.966
Fatality and the injured man...

03:21.002 --> 03:22.601
either of them connected to Leo?

03:22.637 --> 03:24.837
Errol Jordan was a homeless man
who had the bad luck

03:24.872 --> 03:27.773
of sneaking into the basement
and fell asleep.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.509
Karl Wimer was passing by,
ran in to save Jordan,

03:30.534 --> 03:32.382
- and got severely burned.
- Talk to me about the defense.

03:32.407 --> 03:34.546
They argued
Leo grew up in the restaurant.

03:34.581 --> 03:35.813
His parents started it,

03:35.849 --> 03:38.116
raised him and his brothers there.

03:38.152 --> 03:40.018
The three boys were inseparable
their whole lives.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.163
That didn't change 'cause of
a bunch of spilled tea.

03:42.188 --> 03:43.461
Anthony, the youngest brother,

03:43.486 --> 03:44.856
shared an apartment with Leo.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.060
He testified Leo was asleep
when the fire started.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.727
Unfortunately,
when your alibi's provided

03:49.763 --> 03:51.163
by an adoring brother...

03:51.198 --> 03:53.065
You have no alibi.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.699
I'm sorry. Was I blocking
the board the whole time?

03:54.734 --> 03:55.833
You want me to start again?

03:55.869 --> 03:56.734
That'd be great. Thanks.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.503
Also, the judge tied the defense's hands

03:58.539 --> 04:01.573
by refusing to let them argue
diminished capacity.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.641
Can you explain to us
the meaning of that term?

04:03.677 --> 04:05.577
We know what it means, you know
what it means. Why explain it?

04:05.612 --> 04:06.544
For the audience.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.713
In criminal law,
"diminished capacity" means

04:08.748 --> 04:10.682
the accused is incapable of formulating

04:10.717 --> 04:12.516
the specific intent to commit the crime.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.886
So that's a different argument
than actual innocence?

04:14.921 --> 04:17.889
Yes. It would've reduced
Leo's sentence substantially.

04:17.923 --> 04:20.564
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what
we call "unnecessary exposition."

04:20.594 --> 04:21.745
I'll investigate the fire.

04:21.771 --> 04:24.379
- Could be an accident instead of arson.
- Take Maxine with you.

04:24.404 --> 04:27.599
Sam, talk to the judge about
her, uh, ruling on capacity.

04:27.634 --> 04:31.603
Tess, get all the parasite's
interview transcripts from the case.

04:31.638 --> 04:32.570
I'll go talk to Leo.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.871
Y-You're going in four different
directions. I've only got one cameraman.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.173
I've only got five days.
You're on your own.

04:37.209 --> 04:39.009
Let's go.

04:39.044 --> 04:40.110
Thank you so much.

04:46.485 --> 04:48.891
So, when would you like to do
your one-on-one interview?

04:48.916 --> 04:49.828
Never.

04:49.853 --> 04:51.187
It'll only be five minutes, tops.

04:51.223 --> 04:56.192
You get to film
CIU's investigation... period.

04:56.228 --> 04:58.095
Didn't realize you were
so traumatized by it.

04:58.130 --> 04:58.862
By what?

04:58.897 --> 05:00.196
Growing up in the White House,

05:00.232 --> 05:01.531
all the cameras around all the time.

05:01.566 --> 05:02.766
Eh...

05:02.801 --> 05:07.537
What bothers me is
how my team acts around you.

05:07.572 --> 05:09.605
That and your delusion.

05:09.641 --> 05:11.473
Delusion? In what way?

05:11.509 --> 05:14.110
You think you're helping Leo,
as opposed to exploiting him.

05:14.145 --> 05:17.647
This is an important story
that needs to be told,

05:17.682 --> 05:19.649
and I've been working on it
for the past two years

05:19.684 --> 05:20.650
without seeing a dime.

05:20.685 --> 05:23.953
But you intend to...
eventually... see a dime.

05:23.988 --> 05:25.721
Hopefully, a whole lot of dimes.

05:25.757 --> 05:28.457
Would I like this to be the next
"Making a Murderer"? Sure.

05:28.492 --> 05:29.591
That doesn't mean I don't care.

05:29.627 --> 05:31.627
No, just that your caring is...

05:31.663 --> 05:34.263
financially motivated...
ergo, exploitation.

05:34.298 --> 05:36.165
I can't win with you, can I?

05:36.200 --> 05:39.135
Feel free to stop playing the game.

05:42.005 --> 05:43.605
Where do you think you're headed?

05:43.641 --> 05:44.641
With you, to the prison.

05:44.675 --> 05:46.975
They're not gonna let you in.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.810
We have clearance to film there.

05:48.845 --> 05:52.648
I think someone might have
called and gotten that revoked.

05:53.651 --> 05:54.816
Bye.

05:58.622 --> 05:59.921
- I'm Vince.
- Hayes.

05:59.956 --> 06:01.256
My wife... Rita.

06:01.292 --> 06:03.124
Thanks so much for looking into
my brother's case.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.526
It means a lot to us.

06:06.297 --> 06:08.530
Hi. I'm Hayes.

06:08.566 --> 06:09.831
Unh.

06:09.866 --> 06:11.166
What happened to your pants, Leo?

06:11.202 --> 06:13.201
Clearly, some animals here stole them.

06:13.236 --> 06:14.602
I need to hear it from him. Leo?

06:14.637 --> 06:15.837
The guard's bringing another pair.

06:15.872 --> 06:17.592
I-I-I don't want
to get anyone in trouble.

06:23.213 --> 06:24.612
It's okay.

06:26.583 --> 06:27.716
You can tell me.

06:27.751 --> 06:30.151
The other guys got angry 'cause I
wanted to sleep with a night light.

06:30.187 --> 06:32.558
- I don't like the dark.
- Me neither.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.789
I slept with the bathroom light
on until I was 15.

06:34.825 --> 06:35.857
Really?

06:35.892 --> 06:37.158
Mm-hmm.

06:40.663 --> 06:43.198
I need to ask you some questions
about the fire. Is that okay?

06:43.233 --> 06:45.065
I didn't do it. I didn't
have matches or anything.

06:45.101 --> 06:46.367
I know, but the fire started

06:46.402 --> 06:48.869
because someone lit something
and threw it in the deep fryer.

06:48.904 --> 06:51.138
I would never do that. Fire's dangerous.

06:51.173 --> 06:52.673
Well, maybe you made a mistake?

06:52.709 --> 06:54.308
No. I always follow the rules.

06:54.344 --> 06:57.878
Vince and Anthony and me,
we grew up in that restaurant.

06:57.913 --> 06:58.746
It's our home.

06:58.781 --> 06:59.813
Anthony... that's your other brother?

06:59.849 --> 07:02.883
Uh-huh. I have two brothers
and my cat... Meatball.

07:02.918 --> 07:04.218
And does Anthony come
and visit you, too?

07:04.254 --> 07:07.255
Yes. But not with Vince and Rita.

07:07.290 --> 07:09.690
They don't really talk anymore.

07:09.726 --> 07:11.626
He's just a little too busy
counting his money.

07:14.797 --> 07:17.964
You... want an M&M?

07:25.106 --> 07:27.073
Thank you.

07:33.282 --> 07:35.582
- Judge Hinds?
- Hey, do you have a minute?

07:35.617 --> 07:38.746
This is my time, Mr. Spencer.
I got to get my 10,000 steps.

07:38.771 --> 07:41.087
I'll keep up. Leo Scarlata...
we're reviewing his case.

07:41.122 --> 07:43.503
He's got an IQ of 73, which is on
the lower end of the spectrum.

07:43.528 --> 07:45.925
Not low enough to qualify
for diminished capacity.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.294
IQ tests are notoriously subjective.

07:47.329 --> 07:49.228
Another tester might have
given him a lower score.

07:49.264 --> 07:50.163
Or higher.

07:50.198 --> 07:51.931
I can appreciate
what you're trying to do,

07:51.966 --> 07:54.700
but regardless of his IQ,
Mr. Scarlata's where he belongs.

07:54.735 --> 07:56.904
He's getting beaten up
on a regular basis in Sing Sing.

07:56.929 --> 07:58.137
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:58.173 --> 07:59.839
Individuals like Mr. Scarlata

07:59.874 --> 08:02.308
don't belong in a psych facility
or on the street.

08:02.343 --> 08:04.243
But need I remind you, a man died.

08:04.279 --> 08:05.178
He doesn't belong in prison.

08:05.213 --> 08:07.686
The law doesn't agree with you,
Mr. Spencer.

08:07.711 --> 08:09.577
Have a nice day.

08:13.021 --> 08:15.354
Between the fire
and the firemen putting it out,

08:15.389 --> 08:16.956
the place was totaled.

08:16.991 --> 08:18.991
40 years, my parents
kept this place going,

08:19.027 --> 08:20.759
and overnight, we're out of business.

08:20.795 --> 08:21.994
That must have been devastating.

08:22.030 --> 08:22.995
It destroyed my family.

08:23.031 --> 08:24.297
I mean, Leo went to prison,

08:24.332 --> 08:26.164
Vince walked away from the business.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.334
I mean, I went from spending every
waking hour with my brothers

08:29.369 --> 08:30.869
to hardly ever seeing them.

08:30.904 --> 08:32.437
Looks a lot like the old place.

08:32.472 --> 08:34.873
I kept the layout the same
as when my mom ran the kitchen,

08:34.908 --> 08:38.513
so now when I come in in the morning,
it's like I'm a kid again.

08:38.538 --> 08:40.145
Yeah.

08:40.179 --> 08:42.313
Well, the fire investigator
followed a protocol...

08:42.349 --> 08:47.452
went from the least-burned areas
to here, the most damaged.

08:48.355 --> 08:50.455
He thought this "V" pattern on the wall

08:50.490 --> 08:52.157
indicated a high-speed burn.

08:52.192 --> 08:53.291
That's why he ruled arson.

08:53.327 --> 08:56.194
And he decided the deep fryer
was the point of origin.

08:56.230 --> 08:58.902
So, how did the fire get
from here to the deep fryer?

09:01.067 --> 09:04.034
Max, can you turn that fan on
for me, please?

09:13.112 --> 09:15.212
Doesn't seem that the flame
could ever travel that far.

09:15.248 --> 09:17.047
- No.
- What does that mean?

09:17.083 --> 09:19.417
The fire was deliberate. This was arson.

09:19.452 --> 09:21.886
It doesn't mean that Leo started it.

09:21.921 --> 09:23.354
Yeah, well, whoever did...

09:23.390 --> 09:26.391
used something to ignite the blaze,

09:26.426 --> 09:28.092
like a, uh...

09:28.127 --> 09:29.861
like a kitchen rag.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.932
And then he threw it
into the deep fryer.

09:38.470 --> 09:41.237
Grease fires get smoky very fast.

09:41.273 --> 09:44.408
The victim, Mr. Jordan, would've
woken up in the smoky basement,

09:44.443 --> 09:47.477
while upstairs, plumes of hot air
and gas were being built up.

09:47.513 --> 09:48.548
The door was locked.

09:48.573 --> 09:50.020
Mr. Jordan would've screamed for help.

09:50.048 --> 09:53.383
Our Good Samaritan, Karl,
heard the screams outside, ran in.

09:59.124 --> 10:00.857
The door to the basement was locked.

10:02.294 --> 10:03.960
He tried to break it down but couldn't.

10:05.964 --> 10:08.231
At that point,
the fire reached flashover.

10:08.266 --> 10:10.800
It became so intense,
Karl had to give up,

10:10.835 --> 10:13.269
but when he tried to get out,
he got lost in the smoke,

10:13.305 --> 10:15.471
finally collapsing near here,

10:15.506 --> 10:18.074
the site of another low burn.

10:21.313 --> 10:23.279
These bins... What was in them?

10:23.315 --> 10:26.416
Recycling... cans, bottles,
used cooking oil.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.284
They used to be plastic
instead of metal.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.486
Oh.

10:30.521 --> 10:32.161
You had a hood like this
back then, right?

10:32.190 --> 10:35.258
Yeah. It was regulation
back in 2001... same as today.

10:35.293 --> 10:37.293
If the fire started at the deep fryer,

10:37.329 --> 10:39.128
a hood like this
would've slowed it way down,

10:39.164 --> 10:40.563
maybe even put it out.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.464
What if the fire started somewhere else?

10:42.499 --> 10:44.232
Like in a barrel of used cooking oil.

10:48.305 --> 10:52.174
Fire went up the wall,
across the ceiling,

10:52.209 --> 10:53.641
through the vent hood,

10:53.677 --> 10:56.611
flames shot out above the deep fryer.

10:56.646 --> 10:59.614
No hood extinguisher
could've stopped that.

10:59.649 --> 11:03.185
Maybe the fire started
right here... the oil bins.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.886
As opposed to the deep fryer.

11:04.921 --> 11:06.188
Yeah.

11:06.223 --> 11:08.190
This is where they found Karl.

11:08.225 --> 11:11.159
Maybe Karl didn't try to save anyone,

11:11.195 --> 11:12.995
because he's the one that set the fire.

11:14.398 --> 11:16.364
Maybe he stayed
to watch his creation burn

11:16.399 --> 11:17.899
until it caught up with him.

11:29.245 --> 11:31.212
So, Leo's not off the hook, but...

11:31.247 --> 11:35.016
But our Good Samaritan sure
looks like a good suspect.

11:44.743 --> 11:46.210
_

11:46.235 --> 11:49.047
You think Karl got trapped
and burned by a fire he started?

11:49.126 --> 11:50.192
Happens all the time.

11:50.227 --> 11:51.393
Hey, where's Sam and Tess?

11:51.429 --> 11:53.495
Still reviewing the transcripts
from Paul's interviews.

11:53.531 --> 11:55.497
So far, they haven't found
anything not in the court record.

11:55.533 --> 11:57.966
They seem bored out of their minds.

11:59.036 --> 12:01.270
Uh, Maxine, can you tilt the screen?

12:01.305 --> 12:03.105
I'm getting a...

12:04.411 --> 12:05.457
Oops.

12:05.482 --> 12:06.883
I can either film this later...

12:08.294 --> 12:10.278
Apologies. So juvenile.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.213
Frankie, go on.

12:12.448 --> 12:13.730
Karl's a solid suspect.

12:13.755 --> 12:15.727
You know, arsonists get off
on being close to the flames...

12:15.752 --> 12:17.418
...feeling the power.

12:18.521 --> 12:19.387
What are you doing?

12:19.422 --> 12:20.854
Just feeling the...

12:20.890 --> 12:21.922
...power.

12:21.957 --> 12:23.257
I'm sorry.

12:23.293 --> 12:25.559
Actually, I'm not sorry.
This is fun. You want to try?

12:25.595 --> 12:26.560
All right.

12:26.596 --> 12:27.728
I get it.

12:27.764 --> 12:29.229
Forget it.

12:29.265 --> 12:30.564
You... are... a...

12:36.939 --> 12:38.318
What was Karl's motive?

12:38.343 --> 12:40.694
He has no record for arson or vandalism.

12:40.719 --> 12:41.909
He doesn't have a criminal record,

12:41.944 --> 12:44.011
but he does have a hero record.

12:44.046 --> 12:46.446
A month before the Scarlata fire,

12:46.481 --> 12:49.582
Karl pulled a 12-year-old girl
out of heavy surf at Jones Beach.

12:49.618 --> 12:52.853
And before that, he saved
his neighbor by administering CPR.

12:52.888 --> 12:55.289
- Could be coincidence.
- Three times in less than a year?

12:55.324 --> 12:57.024
Either Karl is Batman...

12:57.059 --> 12:58.425
Or there's no such thing as a hero.

12:58.460 --> 12:59.559
Mm.

13:03.799 --> 13:05.065
How do you like working in CIU?

13:05.100 --> 13:07.034
It's great... very rewarding.

13:07.069 --> 13:09.303
What about working for Hayes Morrison?

13:09.338 --> 13:10.370
More of the same.

13:10.405 --> 13:11.905
Sounds a bit canned,

13:11.941 --> 13:14.407
especially since, uh,
she stole your job.

13:14.443 --> 13:15.908
It's ancient history.

13:15.944 --> 13:18.611
All right, let's, uh, move on
to more recent history.

13:18.647 --> 13:21.481
Your last case...
things ended rather tragically.

13:21.516 --> 13:23.402
You're talking about
George Stayner's suicide?

13:23.427 --> 13:24.324
Yes.

13:24.349 --> 13:25.485
Is that really relevant?

13:25.520 --> 13:28.288
I want the audience to understand
the stakes for you at this job.

13:28.323 --> 13:29.856
Sometimes, it's literally life or death.

13:29.891 --> 13:32.459
Has anything like that
ever happened to you before?

13:34.730 --> 13:35.962
I've been to a lot of crime scenes,

13:35.997 --> 13:38.732
I've seen bodies, but...

13:38.767 --> 13:41.368
actually seeing it happen...

13:41.403 --> 13:43.737
Do you think there's anything
you could've done differently?

13:43.772 --> 13:46.205
- Not me, no.
- You were with Maxine, right?

13:46.230 --> 13:47.582
Yeah. There's nothing
she could've done, either.

13:47.607 --> 13:50.244
I mean, the guy was going to prison,
he knew he couldn't handle it.

13:50.269 --> 13:52.502
Do you think she could have
tried harder to talk him down?

13:53.558 --> 13:55.848
Maxine tends to attack
every problem head-on,

13:55.884 --> 13:58.717
which usually works for her,
but, you know...

13:58.753 --> 14:02.321
So, you think if she had been
a more-skilled negotiator,

14:02.356 --> 14:03.522
the man might still be alive?

14:05.526 --> 14:07.760
That's not what I said.

14:07.796 --> 14:10.997
You know what? Let's, uh...
Let's back up, delete it, start again.

14:11.032 --> 14:13.532
No. No, no. This is great stuff.

14:13.567 --> 14:16.568
I-I'm really interested
in your take on Leo's case.

14:16.604 --> 14:18.504
Unless, of course, you... you want me

14:18.539 --> 14:20.873
to stop the interview?

14:20.909 --> 14:22.374
No.

14:24.412 --> 14:25.744
You actually think I'd risk my life

14:25.780 --> 14:27.679
just to get my picture
in the Daily News?

14:27.714 --> 14:29.447
You didn't plan on risking your life.

14:29.482 --> 14:30.882
Fire spread quick. You got trapped.

14:30.918 --> 14:32.918
I got trapped because
I ran into a burning building

14:32.953 --> 14:34.085
when I heard someone screaming.

14:34.121 --> 14:36.922
A building you happened
to be walking by at 3:00 A.M.?

14:36.957 --> 14:38.790
I was in a band,
our gigs would run late.

14:38.826 --> 14:40.758
I... I'd be too amped up to sleep,

14:40.794 --> 14:42.760
so I'd go for these long walks
to wind down.

14:42.796 --> 14:44.029
Yeah, publicity you got playing hero

14:44.064 --> 14:45.596
must have been good for your band, huh?

14:45.632 --> 14:49.767
Hey, what I got from "playing the hero"

14:49.803 --> 14:50.768
was six months in a burn unit,

14:50.804 --> 14:52.938
having my wounds debrided
with an iron brush.

14:57.811 --> 15:03.715
I-I-I get that you believe
Leo doesn't belong in prison,

15:03.750 --> 15:06.083
but trust me...
he definitely started that fire.

15:06.118 --> 15:08.052
If you weren't there until
after the fire started burning,

15:08.087 --> 15:10.184
- how could you know?
- Because he told me.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.990
H-He wrote me letters
when I was in the hospital...

15:13.025 --> 15:14.826
said he was sorry.

15:14.861 --> 15:16.394
He confessed.

15:22.101 --> 15:23.934
Look who's here.

15:23.970 --> 15:25.803
We got our shooting
credentials restored.

15:25.839 --> 15:27.438
Goodie!

15:31.644 --> 15:32.777
Hi, Leo.

15:34.680 --> 15:38.948
Leo, why did you send these letters
to Karl if you didn't start the fire?

15:38.984 --> 15:41.485
Uh, he was hurt real bad,
and I wanted him to feel better.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.754
You said that you felt sorry
that he was hurt.

15:43.789 --> 15:44.654
You wrote that.

15:44.690 --> 15:45.955
I-It was really sad

15:45.991 --> 15:48.592
what happened to him and the other guy.

15:48.627 --> 15:50.627
When something sad happens,
you're supposed to say "Sorry."

15:50.662 --> 15:52.328
Leo, did you start the fire?

15:52.364 --> 15:53.497
No! I told you.

15:53.532 --> 15:55.632
Then why did you say you didn't
mean for him to get hurt?

15:55.667 --> 15:56.767
I told you...

15:56.802 --> 15:59.102
because I felt bad for him
that he was in the hospital.

15:59.137 --> 16:01.438
Leo, do you know the difference
between right and wrong?

16:02.908 --> 16:04.441
Did you know how to turn on the stove?

16:04.476 --> 16:06.509
My dad taught me
never to play with the stove.

16:06.544 --> 16:07.544
Someone could get hurt.

16:07.578 --> 16:08.811
Someone did get hurt.

16:10.715 --> 16:13.649
Leo, do you swear
you didn't start the fire?

16:19.189 --> 16:20.856
I pinkie-swear it.

16:31.936 --> 16:34.570
You uncovered
a totally new point of origin

16:34.605 --> 16:36.038
for the fire at the restaurant kitchen.

16:36.073 --> 16:37.372
Is that right?

16:37.408 --> 16:38.574
Uh... yeah.

16:38.609 --> 16:42.877
It's pretty cool, you know,
using science to uncover the truth.

16:44.614 --> 16:46.014
Where'd your interest
in all this stem from?

16:46.050 --> 16:48.716
Oh, I got into forensics when...

16:48.752 --> 16:50.018
...when I was locked up.

16:51.221 --> 16:52.421
Oh, right.

16:52.456 --> 16:55.590
You... You were incarcerated...
uh, three years, Queensboro?

16:55.625 --> 16:59.094
Yeah. Yeah, grand-theft auto.

16:59.129 --> 17:01.719
But... But, you know,
my... my cellmate, Rey,

17:01.744 --> 17:03.698
he put me onto the "Forensic Files,"

17:03.733 --> 17:06.167
and there was only one TV on the block,

17:06.203 --> 17:08.736
so we kind of watched
together every day.

17:08.771 --> 17:09.704
I-I got hooked.

17:09.739 --> 17:12.674
Guess Rey helped you
find your purpose, huh?

17:13.777 --> 17:15.009
Yeah.

17:15.044 --> 17:16.877
I mean, without this,

17:16.912 --> 17:19.780
who knows where I'd be right now?

17:19.815 --> 17:21.311
He, um...

17:22.785 --> 17:24.185
pretty much saved my life.

17:50.716 --> 17:52.649
Damn.

18:05.995 --> 18:07.060
Damn.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.442
Damn.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.789
Did he ever get into trouble
when you guys were growing up?

18:36.824 --> 18:37.824
No. Nothing serious.

18:37.859 --> 18:39.159
...a couple of kids were...

18:39.194 --> 18:40.560
You know, kids can be jerks.

18:40.595 --> 18:43.196
...got mad because we wouldn't
let him in our tree house.

18:43.231 --> 18:44.197
Damn.

18:56.644 --> 18:57.610
You're gonna want to see this.

18:57.645 --> 18:58.945
Found this on Paul's computer.

18:58.980 --> 19:01.881
Uh, future reference...
consent to pull it out

19:01.916 --> 19:03.683
doesn't equal consent to stick it in.

19:03.718 --> 19:05.117
What were you doing on Paul's computer?

19:06.654 --> 19:09.021
Did he ever get into trouble
when you guys were growing up?

19:09.057 --> 19:10.122
No. Nothing serious.

19:10.157 --> 19:12.558
Pushed a couple of kids for teasing him.

19:12.594 --> 19:14.026
You know, kids can be jerks.

19:14.062 --> 19:15.227
Once, Leo got mad

19:15.262 --> 19:17.730
'cause we wouldn't let him
in our tree house.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.999
We didn't want him to fall and get hurt.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.568
He didn't understand.

19:22.604 --> 19:24.737
Later, after we left,
he set the tree house on fire.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.241
That is a similar prior act.

19:29.276 --> 19:30.444
More like an identical act.

19:30.469 --> 19:33.912
Leo has a history of
starting fires when he's angry.

19:33.947 --> 19:36.014
Paul and Leo's brothers
knew it all along.

19:44.708 --> 19:46.239
_

19:46.264 --> 19:47.505
Leo setting fire to the tree house

19:47.513 --> 19:49.179
parallels him
setting fire to the restaurant.

19:49.214 --> 19:50.622
It is beyond damaging,
and you withheld it.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.253
That story would never
be allowed in court.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.017
I don't care about the court.
I care about the truth...

19:54.052 --> 19:56.058
- Clearly, an alien concept to you.
- Hayes, I think it's...

19:56.083 --> 19:59.222
He buried footage that makes Leo
look guilty... hid it from us.

19:59.258 --> 20:01.635
Your employee stole footage from me
worth thousands of dollars.

20:01.660 --> 20:02.752
That's felony theft.

20:02.777 --> 20:04.181
Who made that valuation... your mother?

20:04.206 --> 20:05.135
Calm down.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.197
Okay, look, I'm trying to help Leo

20:07.232 --> 20:09.400
and, in the process,
hundreds of others like him,

20:09.435 --> 20:10.668
who are being railroaded by the system

20:10.703 --> 20:13.271
because they lack the wherewithal
to protect themselves.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.771
And if you have to lie to do it...

20:14.796 --> 20:16.506
People with intellectual disabilities

20:16.541 --> 20:18.981
make up nearly 3%
of the general population,

20:19.078 --> 20:21.377
but it's almost triple that
in the prison population.

20:21.413 --> 20:23.046
That's not a lie. That is a fact!

20:23.082 --> 20:25.782
One that you're up-front with
because it supports your agenda.

20:25.818 --> 20:26.983
You agree with his agenda.

20:27.019 --> 20:28.419
Noble intentions don't make it okay

20:28.453 --> 20:30.320
to withhold information
or obscure the truth.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.254
My job as a filmmaker

20:31.289 --> 20:33.323
is to tell Leo's story
in an impactful way.

20:33.358 --> 20:34.324
Giving you a free pass

20:34.359 --> 20:36.960
to manipulate the audience,
Leo, his family...

20:36.995 --> 20:39.596
anything to ensure that
your movie gets a happy ending

20:39.631 --> 20:40.831
so someone buys it.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.498
That is all you care about,

20:42.534 --> 20:44.968
because underneath the empathy
for people like Leo,

20:45.003 --> 20:45.969
you're a whore.

20:46.004 --> 20:47.570
- And I'm done.
- Hayes.

20:47.606 --> 20:50.139
I choose the cases, remember?
I'm unchoosing this one.

20:50.174 --> 20:51.441
You can't do that. We had an agreement.

20:51.476 --> 20:53.309
Then you're a whore, too.

20:53.345 --> 20:55.111
Get that out of my face!

21:00.452 --> 21:02.118
Vince spends his whole life

21:02.153 --> 21:04.420
taking care of and protecting Leo

21:04.456 --> 21:06.322
and then throws him
under the bus on-camera?

21:06.358 --> 21:08.190
- Why?
- Maybe it was an innocent slip.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.425
No such thing.

21:09.461 --> 21:10.326
Where's Paul?

21:10.362 --> 21:11.594
Out buying a new camera.

21:11.630 --> 21:14.196
What if Vince wanted to make sure

21:14.232 --> 21:15.465
that Leo wasn't exonerated,

21:15.500 --> 21:17.199
make sure the truth wouldn't come out?

21:17.235 --> 21:19.034
You think Vince lit the fire,
let Leo take the fall?

21:19.070 --> 21:20.936
The insurance payout did have
a lot of zeros after it.

21:20.972 --> 21:21.904
I found something odd.

21:21.939 --> 21:24.038
Vince didn't deposit
his insurance payout.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.040
He signed it over
to Powell & Associates.

21:26.076 --> 21:27.609
I called to ask about the transaction,

21:27.645 --> 21:29.177
but as soon as I said I was CIU...

21:29.212 --> 21:30.178
They hung up on you?

21:30.213 --> 21:32.314
How'd you know?

21:32.349 --> 21:33.649
Their business is money laundering.

21:33.684 --> 21:35.384
They hire Ivy League attorneys

21:35.419 --> 21:38.487
to hide money for
superrich corporate titans.

21:38.522 --> 21:40.054
They recruited heavily
from my law school.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.291
Vince was definitely not super-rich.

21:42.326 --> 21:44.393
I'll take care of Powell.
You keep digging on Vince.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.296
Getting right back on your horse.

21:47.331 --> 21:48.497
Good for you!

21:48.532 --> 21:49.631
Where are you going?

21:49.667 --> 21:52.167
To the bathroom. I'll be right back.

21:52.202 --> 21:54.202
Oh, actually, I might be a while.

21:54.237 --> 21:55.337
I'm big on whole grains.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.507
Okay.

21:59.542 --> 22:03.043
So, what kind of cop are you?

22:03.078 --> 22:04.545
Second-generation.

22:04.580 --> 22:06.647
No complaints, no problems.

22:06.683 --> 22:07.448
I'm proud of my time.

22:07.483 --> 22:09.917
You liked being a cop. Why retire?

22:09.952 --> 22:12.085
I was ready to move on.

22:12.743 --> 22:14.054
You okay?

22:14.089 --> 22:15.423
Yeah. I just...
I tweaked my back last week.

22:15.458 --> 22:17.658
Did that, uh, happen during
the George Stayner incident?

22:19.562 --> 22:23.063
You remember the George Stayner
incident, right?

22:25.935 --> 22:28.035
He killed himself in front
of me, so yeah, I remember.

22:28.070 --> 22:30.070
Sam suggested you might have been able

22:30.105 --> 22:32.071
to handle that situation better...

22:32.106 --> 22:34.407
maybe if you'd been less aggressive.

22:34.443 --> 22:35.342
Sam said that?

22:35.377 --> 22:37.210
Do you feel responsible
for what happened?

22:39.247 --> 22:41.247
A man died that day.

22:41.282 --> 22:42.449
I'm not interested

22:42.484 --> 22:46.686
in helping you make that
into entertainment.

22:57.466 --> 22:59.699
Ms. Morrison. Glen Powell.

22:59.735 --> 23:02.034
I know an associate of yours
called the office.

23:02.070 --> 23:05.270
However, we're bound
by client-privacy regulations.

23:05.305 --> 23:07.439
I'm here on a personal matter.

23:09.076 --> 23:10.542
My co-op board

23:10.578 --> 23:14.946
wants to restructure
the shareholder contract

23:14.982 --> 23:17.261
to safeguard against owners

23:17.324 --> 23:20.487
renting to the Airbnb types.

23:23.276 --> 23:25.196
_

23:30.197 --> 23:34.065
Do you know how long it would take you

23:34.101 --> 23:37.603
to draft us a new contract?

23:40.549 --> 23:43.574
_

23:45.344 --> 23:48.750
About a week... tops.

23:50.546 --> 23:52.940
_

23:56.346 --> 23:57.522
You can't take that!

23:57.557 --> 23:58.723
Sure I can.

23:58.758 --> 24:02.627
Just like I'm sure I can have
the Feds crawling up your ass

24:02.662 --> 24:03.956
in less than 10 minutes.

24:04.050 --> 24:07.465
Money laundering is like catnip
to the Justice Department.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.447
Or you can tell me

24:09.472 --> 24:11.435
where Vince Scarlata
was stashing his money.

24:21.580 --> 24:24.326
Vince had the funds
transferred to Ace Den.

24:24.351 --> 24:27.317
It's a high-roller casino...
very hush-hush.

24:27.352 --> 24:28.261
Vince was a gambler?

24:28.286 --> 24:31.688
Not a very good one.
He was in pretty deep.

24:31.723 --> 24:34.524
That insurance payout saved his life.

24:42.758 --> 24:44.258
_

24:44.333 --> 24:46.199
You didn't tell us
the whole story, Mr. Scarlata.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.001
What story's that?

24:48.036 --> 24:49.770
We know about your secret.

24:49.805 --> 24:53.073
I assume you're talking about
his gambling debt.

24:54.209 --> 24:55.709
That hasn't been a secret
for a long time.

24:55.745 --> 24:57.645
That still doesn't mean you
didn't burn the restaurant down.

24:57.680 --> 25:00.013
Wait. You think I set the fire?

25:00.819 --> 25:03.934
That restaurant was my father's
legacy, his life's work.

25:03.959 --> 25:05.452
I could never burn that place down.

25:05.488 --> 25:07.052
The insurance payout's
a pretty big motive.

25:07.088 --> 25:10.122
You think I'd let my brother
rot in prison for money?

25:10.158 --> 25:12.124
When our parents died,

25:12.160 --> 25:14.627
I swore I would always protect him.

25:14.663 --> 25:17.363
So, where were you the night
the restaurant caught fire?

25:17.399 --> 25:18.981
The restaurant closes
at 10:00 every night,

25:19.006 --> 25:21.200
so he was home around 11:30.

25:21.235 --> 25:23.636
And he was asleep beside me
when we got the call about the fire.

25:23.672 --> 25:25.538
- Are we done here?
- Yeah.

25:25.573 --> 25:27.540
That's enough.

25:30.244 --> 25:32.178
You want to check his alibi
at the building, or should I?

25:32.213 --> 25:33.346
I don't know. Can you trust me?

25:33.381 --> 25:35.080
What's that supposed to mean?

25:35.116 --> 25:37.249
You never know how I'm gonna
react to a situation.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.485
I might come across too aggressive.

25:42.756 --> 25:44.156
I didn't mean it like that.

25:44.192 --> 25:45.192
How did you mean it?

25:46.694 --> 25:47.759
That's exactly what they want.

25:47.795 --> 25:50.762
I don't give a damn who sees.

25:50.798 --> 25:53.398
You have no idea what
that situation was like for me.

25:53.434 --> 25:54.566
I was right there.

25:54.601 --> 25:57.703
George had a gun 2 feet from my face.

25:57.738 --> 25:59.938
I didn't know if he was gonna
shoot me or shoot himself.

26:01.442 --> 26:03.575
You're right.

26:03.610 --> 26:04.743
I'm sorry.

26:06.147 --> 26:07.412
I don't need your apology,

26:07.448 --> 26:09.081
and I sure as hell don't need your pity.

26:30.270 --> 26:31.836
Oh! Hold the door!

26:31.872 --> 26:33.938
Hey. Vince's alibi checked out.

26:33.974 --> 26:36.140
His doorman confirmed he was
at home when the fire started.

26:36.176 --> 26:37.775
Makes Leo our prime suspect again.

26:37.810 --> 26:40.778
Unless Vince set some kind of delaying
device to start the fire later.

26:40.813 --> 26:42.404
Sam, you're blocking Frankie.

26:42.429 --> 26:43.529
- Does that help?
- Could you... Nope.

26:43.554 --> 26:44.759
Good.

26:45.986 --> 26:48.615
Oops. I... I dropped my badge.

26:53.525 --> 26:54.457
They annoy me.

26:54.493 --> 26:56.493
- You can't avoid them forever.
- Don't bet on it.

26:56.528 --> 26:57.928
When I was 16, the Secret Service

26:57.963 --> 26:59.930
changed my code name
from "Halo" to "Houdini."

26:59.965 --> 27:01.365
I'm guessing "Halo" was ironic?

27:01.400 --> 27:02.432
Delayed-ignition devices... go.

27:02.467 --> 27:04.368
There was nothing
in the original reports that...

27:04.403 --> 27:06.270
Forget about reports. Go back
to the physical evidence.

27:06.305 --> 27:08.338
I would if I could.
They were destroyed in...

27:08.374 --> 27:09.839
You ready for this...?

27:09.875 --> 27:12.376
a fire at the NYPD evidence warehouse.

27:12.411 --> 27:14.477
The restaurant goes up
in flames, as does our case.

27:14.513 --> 27:15.678
Maybe not.

27:15.714 --> 27:18.515
What about Karl?
I mean, he was burned in the fire,

27:18.550 --> 27:19.950
which means there'd be trace amounts

27:19.985 --> 27:22.818
of any chemicals consumed
in that fire on his skin.

27:22.853 --> 27:26.389
Burn units always take samples
in a suspected-arson case...

27:26.424 --> 27:27.856
blood, hair, skin.

27:27.892 --> 27:29.489
I'm sure they ran panels on him.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.428
Get his records... anything you
can get your hands on.

27:31.453 --> 27:32.795
- Mmhmm.
- If we learn more about the fire,

27:32.830 --> 27:34.663
perhaps it will help us
figure out who started it.

27:34.698 --> 27:35.664
All right.

27:37.835 --> 27:38.968
Thank you.

27:41.539 --> 27:43.306
Is Hayes Morrison easy to work with?

27:43.341 --> 27:44.873
Easy? No.

27:44.909 --> 27:46.374
Great? Yes.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.844
She's a wild card, a force of nature...

27:48.879 --> 27:51.380
exactly what the CIU needs.

27:51.416 --> 27:53.849
This unit is devoted to making sure

27:53.884 --> 27:55.438
there really is justice for all.

27:55.463 --> 27:57.729
And that includes people with
diminished capacity, like Leo?

27:57.754 --> 27:58.642
For everyone.

27:58.667 --> 28:01.222
Injustice anywhere is a threat
to justice everywhere.

28:01.258 --> 28:04.025
Sounds like the sound bite of a man
running for office in the near future.

28:04.061 --> 28:05.260
No comment.

28:05.295 --> 28:07.896
Any chance the U.S. Attorney's
ongoing investigation of you

28:07.932 --> 28:09.875
might derail those plans?

28:10.734 --> 28:12.501
Absolutely not.

28:12.536 --> 28:14.570
Because they're not
going to find anything.

28:15.973 --> 28:18.774
I re-ran chem panels on Karl's
blood and tissue samples...

28:18.809 --> 28:20.676
found trace amounts of triethanolamine.

28:20.711 --> 28:21.844
What does that mean?

28:21.879 --> 28:23.745
Triethanolamine is a common emulsifier.

28:23.781 --> 28:24.713
It's very stable.

28:24.748 --> 28:26.014
That's why it's in everything

28:26.049 --> 28:28.016
from dishwashing detergent to herbicide.

28:28.051 --> 28:31.018
I took separate tubes
and mixed vegetable oil

28:31.053 --> 28:32.587
with every item found in the restaurant

28:32.622 --> 28:33.788
that contained triethanolamine.

28:33.823 --> 28:36.457
In hopes that one of them will
cause a chemical reaction?

28:36.493 --> 28:37.493
Exactly.

28:38.427 --> 28:39.861
How... long has it been?

28:39.896 --> 28:41.762
Two hours.

28:41.798 --> 28:43.798
How long do we wait?

28:43.833 --> 28:45.432
Uh...

28:49.405 --> 28:50.471
What was in that test tube?

28:50.507 --> 28:51.572
Kitty litter.

28:52.609 --> 28:54.241
Meatball lived in the restaurant.

28:55.512 --> 28:56.911
Vince could have dumped the kitty litter

28:56.946 --> 28:58.012
into the oil bin, gone home,

28:58.047 --> 29:00.781
and the fire would've started
long after he was gone.

29:00.817 --> 29:04.385
Only, he was home by 11:30.

29:04.420 --> 29:07.554
That mixture would've triggered
combustion inside of two hours.

29:07.589 --> 29:10.391
The fire didn't start till 3:00 A.M.

29:10.426 --> 29:11.625
Vince's alibi still stands.

29:11.660 --> 29:14.061
According to
the restaurant's POS system,

29:14.096 --> 29:16.796
another passcode logged off
around 1:00 A.M.

29:16.832 --> 29:17.631
Leo?

29:17.666 --> 29:19.500
No... Anthony Scarlata.

29:19.535 --> 29:21.435
Why would Anthony set up his brother?

29:21.470 --> 29:23.070
Framing Leo would've paved the way

29:23.105 --> 29:24.971
for him to franchise the restaurant.

29:25.007 --> 29:26.856
He made a fortune.

29:27.510 --> 29:28.909
Sounds like motive to me.

29:36.279 --> 29:37.685
_

29:42.460 --> 29:43.526
About the other day...

29:43.562 --> 29:44.995
We're good.

29:45.030 --> 29:45.996
I'm sorry.

29:46.031 --> 29:47.630
Me too.

29:56.007 --> 29:57.873
We know you used kitty litter
and vegetable oil

29:57.909 --> 29:58.741
to start the fire.

29:58.776 --> 30:00.976
How would that even work?

30:01.012 --> 30:02.678
It's easy enough to find
on the Internet.

30:02.714 --> 30:04.814
You bought kitty litter earlier
the week of the fire.

30:04.849 --> 30:06.115
We found the charge on your credit card.

30:06.150 --> 30:08.851
I bought it for Leo...
for his cat, Meatball.

30:08.886 --> 30:10.019
You had a cat at the restaurant?

30:10.054 --> 30:12.688
I wanted to get rid of it,
but Leo loved the damn cat.

30:12.724 --> 30:14.123
Wait. Was it Leo's job
to empty the cat litter?

30:14.158 --> 30:15.357
Yeah.

30:19.430 --> 30:21.997
Oh, my God. He...

30:22.033 --> 30:23.565
He dumped it in the wrong bin.

30:23.601 --> 30:25.701
He... He must have made a mistake.

30:29.540 --> 30:30.540
It was an accident.

30:34.578 --> 30:36.545
So, I understand you went to law school,

30:36.580 --> 30:38.513
but you're not a lawyer.

30:39.617 --> 30:40.882
No.

30:40.917 --> 30:41.683
Why is that?

30:41.719 --> 30:43.918
Seems like the logical next step.

30:43.954 --> 30:45.754
What does this have to do
with Leo's case?

30:45.789 --> 30:47.723
I'm just trying to get
a better understanding

30:47.758 --> 30:50.024
of the people that are involved
in this investigation.

30:50.060 --> 30:52.761
You have to pass the bar exam
to be a lawyer.

30:52.796 --> 30:55.163
Well, it's a difficult exam.
Lots of great students...

30:55.198 --> 30:58.032
I was an editor on Law Review
and graduated summa cum laude.

30:58.068 --> 31:00.042
- There's nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm not ashamed.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.628
Not of that.

31:05.942 --> 31:08.376
Tess, what are you ashamed of?

31:18.088 --> 31:20.588
I went to law school
planning to be a prosecutor.

31:20.623 --> 31:23.591
I wanted to put bad guys away.

31:23.626 --> 31:24.893
Around the time of the bar exam,

31:24.928 --> 31:26.522
one of those bad guys was released...

31:26.547 --> 31:28.389
exonerated by DNA.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.669
It was a surprise to me, because...

31:36.273 --> 31:39.206
...it was my testimony
that had put him in prison.

31:40.276 --> 31:42.610
When I sat down to take the bar exam,

31:42.645 --> 31:45.946
all I could see was his face...

31:48.083 --> 31:52.494
...an innocent man
whose life I had... ruined.

31:55.625 --> 31:57.592
I didn't answer a single question.

31:57.627 --> 32:00.261
So instead of putting bad guys
away, you do this?

32:01.731 --> 32:02.896
Yes.

32:07.937 --> 32:10.704
I've never told anyone that before. I...

32:12.407 --> 32:14.374
I guess I didn't realize
that I needed to.

32:14.409 --> 32:17.778
Sometimes, stories
that have tragic beginnings

32:17.813 --> 32:19.613
have happy endings.

32:21.617 --> 32:22.916
I have good news.

32:22.952 --> 32:25.318
We've been able to prove
the fire was an accident.

32:25.354 --> 32:26.754
So I can go home now?

32:26.789 --> 32:28.722
- Yes.
- Not yet.

32:28.758 --> 32:31.825
First, you need to make a statement
admitting your mistake.

32:31.861 --> 32:34.833
Then the D.A. will file a motion
that reduces your sentence.

32:34.858 --> 32:36.536
- My... My... My mistake?
- That the fire started

32:36.561 --> 32:39.005
because you threw the kitty
litter in the wrong trash bin.

32:39.030 --> 32:40.263
No! I didn't do that.

32:40.288 --> 32:42.519
It's okay, Leo. It was
right beside all the other bins.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.605
- It could've happened to anyone.
- No, it didn't happen!

32:44.630 --> 32:48.198
I-I know I'm not smart,
but I-I know how to listen.

32:48.223 --> 32:49.059
I follow the rules.

32:49.084 --> 32:51.436
But you did clean the cat's
litter box that night, right?

32:51.461 --> 32:52.901
Yes, but I didn't do anything wrong.

32:52.926 --> 32:54.526
You have to say it,
or you can't go home.

32:54.561 --> 32:56.628
I-I did... I didn't do anything wrong!

32:56.664 --> 32:59.097
I... Anthony said if I didn't
take care of Meatball

32:59.132 --> 33:01.065
that he'd give him away,
so I did it right...

33:01.101 --> 33:02.066
all the time!

33:02.102 --> 33:03.602
- Leo...
- All the time!

33:03.637 --> 33:05.637
Leo, if you don't admit this mistake,

33:05.673 --> 33:07.238
we can't legally argue with a judge

33:07.274 --> 33:09.073
that you didn't
intentionally start the fire.

33:17.950 --> 33:20.551
I-I followed the rules.

33:20.586 --> 33:21.786
I'm not gonna say I didn't.

33:54.626 --> 33:55.758
I took the stairs.

33:55.793 --> 33:57.193
- You okay?
- Never better.

33:57.228 --> 33:59.762
For what it's worth, thank you.

33:59.797 --> 34:01.796
You did everything
humanly possible for Leo.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.665
Except get him out of prison.

34:03.700 --> 34:04.832
Wasn't your fault.

34:04.868 --> 34:07.135
Who cares whose fault it is?
Doesn't make it suck any less.

34:07.171 --> 34:09.246
You really care about Leo, don't you?

34:09.271 --> 34:10.705
He doesn't belong in prison.

34:10.739 --> 34:13.608
Well, he won't budge
off what he thinks is right.

34:13.643 --> 34:15.621
Almost reminds me of you.

34:19.216 --> 34:22.184
I wish I had half his heart.

34:22.219 --> 34:23.427
D...

35:03.859 --> 35:05.426
Do you ever stop?!

35:20.160 --> 35:23.465
_

35:30.846 --> 35:33.063
I already told you...
I didn't make a mistake.

35:33.088 --> 35:34.054
I'm not changing my mind.

35:34.089 --> 35:36.284
Do you know...

35:36.525 --> 35:37.991
what this is?

35:38.027 --> 35:39.593
Oh, it's my chore chart
from the restaurant.

35:39.628 --> 35:41.194
From the night of the fire.

35:41.229 --> 35:43.696
One of the rules was that you do
everything on this chart, right?

35:43.731 --> 35:44.830
Right.

35:44.866 --> 35:47.221
And that you do them exactly
as you were told, right?

35:47.246 --> 35:49.295
Yes. I always follow the rules.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.043
What about this one?

35:52.040 --> 35:54.040
Bin "B" was the oil bin.

35:54.075 --> 35:55.808
You put the kitty litter in here.

35:57.712 --> 35:58.911
I don't understand.

35:58.947 --> 36:00.913
I-I was following the rules.

36:02.584 --> 36:05.618
We got these charts from
the computer at the restaurant

36:05.653 --> 36:07.053
earlier in the week of the fire.

36:07.088 --> 36:09.989
Where does it say for you
to throw away the kitty litter?

36:21.735 --> 36:23.034
Bin "A."

36:23.070 --> 36:25.437
But the night of the fire was different.

36:28.976 --> 36:30.642
I was following the rules.

36:30.677 --> 36:32.411
It's not your fault.

36:37.518 --> 36:39.751
Leo, who used to make up
the chore charts?

36:41.122 --> 36:43.489
That... That was Rita's job.

36:43.524 --> 36:44.556
Oh.

36:46.527 --> 36:47.759
Did she make a mistake, too?

36:50.831 --> 36:53.164
The fire wasn't an accident.

36:53.199 --> 36:56.101
You told Leo to put kitty litter
in the oil bin.

36:56.136 --> 36:58.803
You made the chore chart.
You knew he'd follow it, no matter what.

36:58.839 --> 37:00.571
No.

37:00.607 --> 37:03.508
Rita loves Leo.
She'd never use him like that.

37:03.543 --> 37:05.944
You knew if he put
the kitty litter in the oil bin,

37:05.979 --> 37:07.812
the restaurant would go up in flames.

37:07.848 --> 37:10.115
Just tell her you didn't do it.

37:11.551 --> 37:12.784
Do it.

37:14.187 --> 37:16.487
Rita, tell her you didn't do it.

37:19.993 --> 37:23.828
I had no idea
that somebody was gonna die...

37:23.864 --> 37:25.796
or get hurt.

37:27.567 --> 37:29.233
I never thought that Leo'd get caught.

37:31.171 --> 37:34.838
That restaurant was killing you.

37:34.874 --> 37:36.674
You were never home.

37:36.709 --> 37:38.809
You were up to your eyeballs in debt.

37:38.844 --> 37:40.611
It always came first.

37:40.647 --> 37:43.281
I hated what that place was doing to us.

37:43.316 --> 37:48.952
You let Leo rot in prison for 15 years?

37:48.988 --> 37:50.054
Vince, please...

37:50.089 --> 37:51.155
No!

37:53.025 --> 37:55.686
NYPD is downstairs to take you in.

37:58.731 --> 38:00.297
Do whatever you want.

38:02.158 --> 38:03.497
I'm done.

38:57.388 --> 38:59.622
Leo.

38:59.657 --> 39:02.725
I am so sorry for... for everything.

39:02.761 --> 39:04.882
It's okay, Vince.
You didn't do anything wrong.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.946
No, he didn't.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.290
I love you.

39:13.937 --> 39:15.270
Both of you.

39:42.501 --> 39:44.934
Things got a little heated
between you and Hayes earlier, huh?

39:44.959 --> 39:46.967
- Par for the course.
- She called you a whore.

39:47.245 --> 39:48.591
That, she did.

39:48.616 --> 39:50.771
Look, the thing about Hayes Morrison...

39:50.807 --> 39:51.872
well, there's no one thing.

39:51.908 --> 39:57.744
She's stubborn, reactionary, fearless...

39:57.780 --> 40:00.414
at least, about the things
most of us are afraid of...

40:00.449 --> 40:03.317
and brilliant.

40:03.352 --> 40:06.187
I've never met anyone else like
her... probably never will.

40:06.222 --> 40:09.190
And that has nothing to do with
her being a former First Daughter.
