00:41.840 --> 00:44.991
Well, well, it's good to know I've
still got it. - What's that, then?

00:45.080 --> 00:48.072
Animal magnetism.
Women keep giving me the eye.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.997
That's not you, you prat. It's him.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.708
Daddy!

01:02.800 --> 01:04.438
Hey, Joshy!

01:07.040 --> 01:10.077
Karen... Hi. Gosh, I wasn't expecting this.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.718
How was Frankfurt?

01:11.800 --> 01:17.033
Not as good as the welcome home.
Rach. Hi. Adam. Great. I'm overwhelmed.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.076
Well, it's nice to be met, isn't it?

01:19.160 --> 01:21.993
When you've been abroad for a while.
- I only went yesterday.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.913
So you haven't been away
as long as Pete and Jo, then?

01:25.000 --> 01:28.390
They've been away a couple of months?
- Three, actually.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.233
Just think of the welcome they'll get
when they come home.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.998
Oh, right...

01:36.080 --> 01:38.310
Wahey!

01:38.400 --> 01:40.311
Hi!

01:40.400 --> 01:42.197
<i>Lovely to see you.</i>

01:42.280 --> 01:44.236
<i>Ooh, the baby.
- You look like a fool.</i>

01:45.280 --> 01:47.077
Hi, love.
- Hello.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.116
Thanks for coming to meet us, guys.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.714
David, thanks for taking time off
from the office.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.075
To be honest...you're welcome, Pete.
- Cheers.

01:58.160 --> 01:59.957
Right, we're this way.
- All right.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.871
See you, Pete.
- See you.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.394
Bye, Karen.
- See you, Rach.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.436
See you, Pete.

02:09.400 --> 02:13.154
Have you got your car here? - I left it
at the office. I thought I'd get a cab.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.231
Well, I could give you a lift if you like.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.191
It's not really worth it now.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.111
Well, home, then.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.633
Yeah.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.596
<i>Bye! Bye!</i>

02:32.200 --> 02:33.758
There we go.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.559
Home, sweet home.
- Hey, not so fast. Not so fast.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.359
What? - I'm supposed to carry
you over the threshold.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.670
Pete!
- It's tradition and it's romantic.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.716
OK.
- Great.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.756
Sorry! Sorry!
- Shit!

02:49.840 --> 02:52.434
Are you all right?
- No, I'm bloody not.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.476
Let's have a look. I'll kiss it better.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.516
That's great.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.676
The painting.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.078
Ramona, we're back.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.515
We saw Daddy.
- Did you?

03:22.600 --> 03:25.478
We gave him a lift home.
- Ooh...

04:14.240 --> 04:16.117
Here, you left these on the stairs.

04:24.320 --> 04:27.551
It's gonna be weird being in here
instead of the spare room.

04:27.640 --> 04:31.269
You're my missus now, not my lodger.
- So I can stop paying you rent?

04:32.320 --> 04:34.390
You weren't thinking of having that side?

04:34.480 --> 04:36.232
Is that a problem?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.275
No...

04:39.400 --> 04:41.675
Pete, I'm hearing yes.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.354
It's just I usually sleep on
the right-hand side.

04:44.440 --> 04:49.230
Well, you didn't when we were in Australia.
- It's like the water going down the plughole.

04:49.320 --> 04:53.950
Once you cross the Equator, it's
the opposite. No, I always sleep on that side.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.314
Why?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.675
Cos I always have. Jenny liked that side.

04:58.720 --> 05:03.510
Oh, I see. So what you're saying is
I can't sleep on the right, which I always do,

05:03.600 --> 05:06.876
because your ex-wife liked to
sleep on the left?

05:06.960 --> 05:10.350
No, no, it's just... I'm just
used to it, that's all.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.836
Well, I guess it's not that big a deal.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.993
I'm not sure about this.
- It's time he was in his own room.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.150
He's only three-and-a-half months.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.959
Exactly. He's old enough
to stand on his own two feet.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.792
He can't stand.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.398
Metaphorically.

05:32.480 --> 05:36.473
Look, we'll be right next door, the door
will be open, we'll have his monitor on.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.552
If he cries, we'll be aware
of it before he is.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.198
Come on.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.118
Come on.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.717
God, it seems ages
since it was just the two of us.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.791
It's not just the two of us, is it?

06:03.880 --> 06:05.836
No, I know, I know, I know, but...

06:05.920 --> 06:07.876
It doesn't matter.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.118
I missed this.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.868
So have you had any more thoughts
about the naming ceremony?

06:24.960 --> 06:28.270
We're not having him christened.
- Rach, I don't know.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.990
It's very Woman's Hour. Know what I mean?
- No, I think it will be nice.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.036
Because otherwi...
- OK! Yeah.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.314
Whatever.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.550
Lovely.
- Thanks, love.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.596
What was that?

06:46.680 --> 06:49.592
I didn't hear anything.
- Oh, my God!

06:49.680 --> 06:52.877
No, Rachel, he's asleep.
You know, he just moved.

06:52.960 --> 06:56.270
It's what normal, healthy, live babies do.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.596
Sorry.
- It's OK.

07:08.560 --> 07:15.033
Hello! I've given him a little feed, so
he should be all right now. Won't you, my love?

07:18.480 --> 07:21.233
<i>Don't forget to brush their teeth.
- Of course.</i>

07:21.320 --> 07:23.754
And the girls need supervising.
- Karen.

07:23.840 --> 07:25.796
Sorry.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.836
Right...

07:28.720 --> 07:31.598
Do you mind if we switch my night
to Tuesday next week?

07:32.640 --> 07:35.279
Our arrangement is
that you have them on Wednesdays.

07:36.320 --> 07:40.313
No, our arrangement is that I have them one
night a week. Thus far it's been Wednesdays,

07:40.400 --> 07:43.392
but next week
I have to take some clients to dinner.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.710
Yeah, of course, sorry. That's fine. Fine.

07:45.800 --> 07:46.755
Thanks.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.831
Right, girls, be good for Daddy.

07:48.920 --> 07:50.876
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.712
Tell me.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.756
Have you got yourself a lawyer yet?

07:55.800 --> 08:00.078
For the divorce? No, I thought it was
going to be straightforward.

08:00.160 --> 08:05.188
It is but, still, I think it's probably best
to have a lawyer to handle all the forms.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.633
Right.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.996
A lawyer. Know any good ones?

08:10.080 --> 08:12.640
Well, ours.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.836
Right.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.273
No...

08:18.360 --> 08:21.113
I think you should have him.
I can easily find another one.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.270
David, are you sure?
- Yes, sure.

08:23.360 --> 08:27.558
Yeah, like we said, you know,
try and make this divorce as...

08:28.920 --> 08:30.558
..amicable as possible.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.596
Thank you.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.432
I appreciate that.

08:38.559 --> 08:42.758
Well, Ramona will drop Josh off after
swimming. Don't let him stay up too late.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.034
Karen...

08:44.120 --> 08:46.076
Sorry.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.359
Great song. The Undertones. Great band.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.956
People will try and tell you that The Jam
were the most important group of the '80s.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.792
That's bollocks.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.475
They will also try and tell you
that Feargal Sharkey was the man. Not true.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.949
John O'Neill, God in human form.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.349
Teenage Kicks, I had my first...

09:10.400 --> 09:12.152
...snog to that song.

09:12.240 --> 09:13.639
What do you think?

09:18.840 --> 09:19.795
Ah...

09:20.840 --> 09:22.558
Batteries not included, eh?

09:24.360 --> 09:29.388
Maybe it's a bit sophisticated for you.
Ah! I have the very thing for you.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.238
Slade.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.631
Hi, are you here for the class?

09:46.720 --> 09:49.029
Yeah.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.793
If you'd like to jump in with
the other ladies.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.711
Why?
- We're ready to start.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.155
Which class you think I here for exactly?

09:56.240 --> 09:58.117
Which class are you here for?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.997
No, I asked first.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.718
Pregnant women?

10:03.800 --> 10:05.358
Hmm?

10:05.440 --> 10:09.399
Well, I'm one short and you were here.
- What? You think I look pregnant?

10:09.480 --> 10:11.436
No, of course not.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.877
You could be, a couple of weeks.
Without an internal, it's hard to say.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.071
No, I'm with him.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.233
So, you were pregnant once.
- No. I'm his nanny.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.154
Then no plans to...
I've still got a couple of places left.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.593
Sorry.

10:29.680 --> 10:35.277
Oh, well. Still, I'll probably see you around.
I work as a lifeguard here as well.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.635
Ah, but I'm not a member.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.552
His parents are.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.076
When I bring him, I go swim.
I don't think nobody mind.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.516
I'll just have to hope
that he needs a lot of lessons.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.194
Right, then, ladies, let's get started.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.953
Joshy!

10:58.040 --> 11:00.600
You are doing so good, you know?

11:01.800 --> 11:03.870
More's the pity.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.875
<i>There she is, the woman that spawned me.</i>

11:10.960 --> 11:13.394
Are you nervous about meeting her
for the first time?

11:13.480 --> 11:16.552
No! Why, should I be?

11:24.440 --> 11:26.396
Audrey, do you need any help?

11:26.480 --> 11:29.552
No, no, no. You sit there.

11:31.600 --> 11:37.869
Get to know each other. Well, it's
lovely to finally get to meet you, Jo.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.997
We never had the chance
before you were married.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.275
It all happened very quickly, Mum.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.878
Didn't it?

11:45.960 --> 11:49.191
Now...I want to hear all about it.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.953
What was the weddlng like?
Was it a big affair?

11:52.040 --> 11:55.669
No, very small.
- Well, about 50 guests.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.318
50...?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.960
<i>I didn't think you'd want to
travel all that way.</i>

12:00.040 --> 12:03.032
You know... You get sick on
the bus into town.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.072
That was very considerate of you, Peter.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.720
Don't you think so, Jenny?

12:09.800 --> 12:11.153
Jo...

12:14.240 --> 12:16.993
Well, anyone for tea?

12:19.080 --> 12:21.036
Hi, Ramona.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.997
Did you drop Josh off OK?

12:23.080 --> 12:26.550
Yeah, yeah. Fine.
Karen, I meet someone at the health club.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.392
He a lifegod.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.550
A what?
- He was so fit.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.713
You know, I think he like me.
- Really? That's nice.

12:40.200 --> 12:44.990
You know, many, many nannies,
they're members of the health club.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.593
Really?
- Mm.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.989
I think I'd like to be one too.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.231
That's nice, Ramona,
if you think you can afford it.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.389
Ah!

12:53.480 --> 12:57.393
But, you see, these nannies,
their employers pay.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.951
As part of their package.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.439
Their package?

13:03.520 --> 13:06.910
Terms of employment.
- Yeah, Ramona, I know what that means.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.276
I'm just surprised you do.
Anything else you fancy?

13:10.360 --> 13:13.079
Pension? Life insurance?
- No.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.116
Just the membership.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.714
Nice try, Ramona, but no can do.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.677
You'll have to ask David.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.716
David?!

13:23.760 --> 13:25.398
I'm sorry, Ramona.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.711
I'm sure there are plenty more lifegods
in the sea.

13:32.640 --> 13:36.110
He's got Adam's eyes, hasn't he?
- So you don't think it's conjunctivitis?

13:36.200 --> 13:37.758
That yellow stuff.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.118
That's just a bit of sleep, isn't it?

13:42.280 --> 13:45.989
That's what the paediatrician said.
Still, what do they know, eh?

13:46.080 --> 13:48.036
Right, coffee...

13:48.120 --> 13:49.678
Yeah.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.554
You can over-worry with your first baby.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.596
Yeah. I mean, some mothers.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.636
I'm glad I'm not like that.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.109
Listen, we've only got instant.
- It's fine.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.556
On the other hand, you can't take
your eyes off them for a second.

14:03.640 --> 14:07.553
He's so tiny. Houses are death traps.
Anything could happen.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.596
Like what, Rach?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.989
Well, for example...

14:14.840 --> 14:17.149
I can't even bring myself to think about it.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.639
How's he sleeping?

14:18.720 --> 14:20.995
In our bed.
- Still?

14:21.080 --> 14:24.152
I thought you were going to move him out.
- So did I.

14:24.240 --> 14:28.279
Rachel has other ideas. At this rate,
I'll have to wait until he's at university.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.318
You'll have to act sooner than that.
What about your sex life?

14:31.400 --> 14:33.118
What sex life?

14:34.160 --> 14:36.116
I always fancied three in a bed.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.158
Not like this, though. But what can I do?

14:39.240 --> 14:43.233
Well, maybe you should surprise her
one night. - He'd wake up.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.839
Why don't you arrange baby-sitting?
Take her out to dinner?

14:46.920 --> 14:49.309
The sooner, the better,
cos you know what they say,

14:49.400 --> 14:53.234
once the sex dies,
the marriage isn't long to follow.

14:53.320 --> 14:58.075
How's little Adam? My grandson.
I never see him.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.754
Pete's first wife took him to America.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.155
He's fine. Sends his love.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.753
Hmm!

15:09.920 --> 15:11.512
You have a lovely place here.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.028
Well, it would be if not for the neighbours.

15:15.120 --> 15:17.395
Why, what's wrong with them?

15:17.480 --> 15:19.835
They're all...old.

15:20.880 --> 15:25.749
Mum, it's sheltered accommodation.
- Yes, but they all behave old.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.310
They're always complaining.
Getting up petitions.

15:29.400 --> 15:33.951
About what?
- Me, mainly. I had a dog.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.996
Cantona.

15:36.080 --> 15:41.200
A lovely animal.
Barked a lot. I had to have her put down.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.271
Because she barked?

15:43.360 --> 15:46.033
No, she was run over.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.392
That was the first petition.
About her barking.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.799
Dead dogs don't bark.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.952
I was very fond of that dog, Peter.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.792
Sorry.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.432
Then that next-door neighbour.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.119
She is blaming me for hoovering.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.716
Hoovering?
- Well...during the night.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.678
I can't sleep. It's my arthritis.

16:14.760 --> 16:18.230
I find hoovering helps.
- You're welcome to come to our place.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.753
Do you mean that?

16:21.480 --> 16:24.870
Cos they've asked me to leave.
Find somewhere else.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.552
You're being evicted?

16:27.640 --> 16:29.596
It won't take me long to pack.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.391
What did you have to do that for?
- What?

16:38.480 --> 16:40.948
Invite her to stay.
- I didn't realise I had.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.600
<i>Well, she seemed to get the impression.</i>

16:43.680 --> 16:47.559
Pete, this isn't a good idea.
We've only been married two minutes.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.791
I thought we'd leave it a little longer
before we started a family.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.758
Then say something.
- I can't. She's my mother.

16:53.840 --> 16:55.990
You do it.
- I can't. She's your mother.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.072
Just give it a couple of days.
I'll find her somewhere else.

16:59.160 --> 17:03.233
I'll ride in the front, if that's all right.
The back seat makes me sick.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.117
The first 50 pages are fantastic.

17:41.200 --> 17:44.317
After that, the whole thing falls apart.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.070
Needed a better editor.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.878
Hi.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.713
Hello.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.398
So, long time, no see.
- Yeah, three months.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.469
Last time I saw you, I seem to remember
you were - that's it - walking away.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.436
Is this really no good?

18:12.480 --> 18:14.755
It's ages since I read a good book.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.558
Been ages since I published one.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.792
Your wife's did quite well.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.075
Yeah, yeah. Marvellous.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.470
She's doing another one.
A different publisher.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.311
You look...fantastic.

18:32.560 --> 18:37.554
Seriously, I was standing up there debating
whether or not to come down and talk to you.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.029
I'm glad you did.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.076
Yes, so am I.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.758
So how have you been?

18:47.840 --> 18:49.432
You know.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.317
No, I don't know.

18:53.960 --> 18:57.316
I was going to phone you,
but I didn't think it was appropriate.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.836
David and I have split up.
We're getting a divorce.

19:00.920 --> 19:05.072
Oh, well, I'm sorry -
if that's not what you wanted.

19:09.600 --> 19:13.559
Um...Karen, a slight confession to make.

19:14.600 --> 19:21.358
I haven't actually read this particular book.
Just the reviews. Been very busy.

19:21.440 --> 19:26.195
I'll tell you what. If I buy it for you,
you can tell me what you think.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.236
Yes.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.518
Yeah?

19:37.880 --> 19:40.348
What about there?
- There's no room.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.715
Take that down.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.358
I couldn't do that.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.388
Pete, this is our house now, right?
- Yeah, of course.

19:49.480 --> 19:55.112
Well, then, some of your things are going
to have to go to make room for our things.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.156
But my stuff is our stuff.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.231
I mean, what's mine is yours.

19:59.320 --> 20:04.474
OK, but I prefer this, which we bought
together, to that, which we didn't.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.028
Yeah, but that has been here
since we moved in...

20:08.080 --> 20:09.832
..I moved in.

20:09.920 --> 20:11.876
Look, my mum bought it for us.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.473
What's that, son?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.312
This painting.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.234
Ah, yes. That was your wedding present,
wasn't it?

20:19.320 --> 20:21.276
First time round.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.836
Right, it's definitely coming down.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.638
She'll be terribly upset.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.233
Who? Your mum or Jenny?

20:31.320 --> 20:34.198
Jenny never cared for it either.
- Well, two against one.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.032
Oh, please!

20:36.120 --> 20:38.839
Pete, you're asking me to spend my evenings

20:38.920 --> 20:43.675
underneath a painting that I don't like
that was a present to you and your first wife!

20:43.760 --> 20:45.716
Yes, bought by my mother.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.588
Oh, Pete, while you're up,
go and put the kettle on.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.278
Your divorce lawyer
was recommended by your husband?

20:58.360 --> 20:59.918
Hmm.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.594
And that doesn't strike you as odd?

21:02.680 --> 21:04.591
No.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.668
Karen, you and David are on opposing sides.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.469
No, it's not like that. We're divorcing
amicably. The lawyers will just handle it.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.677
An amicable divorce is an
oxymoron, actually.

21:18.440 --> 21:22.035
Why do you think David recommended this guy?

21:23.440 --> 21:27.911
To save me the trouble? David says
he's good. He's known him for years.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.549
Precisely. They've probably got a history.
They're probably mates.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.995
I don't think David has mates.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.036
Well, golfing buddies, then.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.076
My point is, they're close.

21:39.560 --> 21:42.711
Look, Karen, amicable or not,

21:42.800 --> 21:47.430
you need someone who is going to put
your interests first, not David's.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.951
This guy is doing my divorce. He is good.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.474
I really appreciate this, Ramona.
- That's OK.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.677
I was only watching television tonight.
This way, I get paid.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.228
If Matthew wakes up, you'll have company.

22:04.320 --> 22:08.233
Rachel's given him a feed so he should be
fine, but you have my mobile number.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.436
Huh-huh. Rachel - she happy
with all this, no?

22:10.520 --> 22:12.476
No. I mean, yes.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.597
Well, she will be.
- But she do know I'm coming?

22:15.680 --> 22:17.432
Ramona, what are you doing here?

22:18.520 --> 22:22.035
Ramona's babysitting. I've booked a table.
You've just got time to change.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.155
What?

22:24.200 --> 22:27.192
Ramona's babysitting.
I've booked us a table.

22:27.280 --> 22:30.636
You've just got time to change.
- You haven't said anything about this.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.792
It wouldn't be a surprise.
The table's booked for 8:00.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.075
Oh, no, I can't go out.
- Not like that.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.594
No, I mean I can't leave Matthew.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.716
I'm not sure we should take him.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.230
Thank you.
- Thanks.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.880
Oh, can we leave this here as well?

22:47.960 --> 22:50.076
''It was a joke.''

22:50.160 --> 22:53.357
I was joking.
We haven't been out together for ages.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.318
We went to Buxton last weekend.
- With Matthew.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.432
I meant just the two of us.
It's never just the two of us any more.

23:00.520 --> 23:02.192
Is this about him being in our bed?

23:02.280 --> 23:05.750
I just thought it would be nice to
have some fun, you know.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.718
Then, when we came home,
we might have some more.

23:09.760 --> 23:13.355
It's like a date. You buy dinner for me
and I have to have sex with you.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.557
No! You wouldn't have to.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.996
I'm thinking about our marriage.
- I just don't want to leave Matthew.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.992
You have to eat.
- No, Adam! No way!

23:26.880 --> 23:28.438
Well, this isn't too bad.

23:28.520 --> 23:31.193
No, it's fine. So, anyway...

23:31.280 --> 23:32.838
Where was I?

23:34.040 --> 23:36.793
The swimming pool.
- Ah, yes. So...

23:36.880 --> 23:39.917
I go there today and Lee, he not even there.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.470
Because what they'd done
is they change the time of Joshy's lesson,

23:43.560 --> 23:46.597
which means
that I might not even see him no more.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.835
That's terrible. What do you
think I should do?

23:52.120 --> 23:53.917
Huh?
- What?

24:00.000 --> 24:01.956
No, Jo, I can't.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.110
I feel funny.
- Oh, God.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.156
Was it my casserole?
- No, no.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.196
That's all cleared up now.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.157
It's having my mum in the next room.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.231
Pete, I'm sure her hearing's not that good.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.072
It doesn't have to be.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.556
She's always had this...sixth sense.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.917
Peter, what are you doing in there?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.752
Sorry.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.956
Wow, the honeymoon really is over.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.276
Great...

24:47.760 --> 24:49.716
What the hell is that?

24:49.800 --> 24:51.756
Pete.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.479
What?
- She's hoovering.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.869
At three o'clock in the morning.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.711
Can I take a look at the book,
please? Thanks.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.718
Mr Marsden?
- Sorry, took me ages to find a cab.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.836
Please come this way.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.514
The traffic was dreadful. Bumper to bumper.

25:16.600 --> 25:21.469
So frustrating when you're stuck in a jam,
conscious of the meter ticking over.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.916
The meter's running already?
I'm only ten minutes late.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.549
No, I meant the taxi. Please do go in.
Would you like coffee?

25:28.640 --> 25:30.471
Thanks, yeah. Milk, no sugar.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.312
David Marsden. So sorry I'm late.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.868
Two coffees, please, Martin, and no calls.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.231
Sorry, I should have introduced myself.
Robyn Duff.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.834
No, no. I'm sorry.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.753
My mistake entirely.
- It's one that many people make.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.512
Though rarely twice.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.352
Mrs Marsden.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.396
Well...not for much longer.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.038
Indeed.

26:02.120 --> 26:08.195
Now, then, your husband is filing for divorce,
I understand. On what grounds, exactly?

26:08.280 --> 26:12.114
Adultery. Not that he's a
stranger to it himself.

26:13.520 --> 26:17.718
Sorry, David was unfaithful to me
about 18 months ago.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.553
I see, and how do you feel about that?

26:21.680 --> 26:23.830
Well, I was pretty pissed off at the time.

26:23.920 --> 26:28.789
No, I mean how do you feel about the fact
that he's citing your adultery?

26:29.840 --> 26:32.308
It's a bit rich, isn't it? He did it first.

26:33.360 --> 26:36.557
But, hey, I'm the woman.
Of course I'm the guilty party.

26:36.640 --> 26:41.873
Well, unless you counter sue. Sue for
divorce on the grounds of his adultery.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.313
Can I do that?

26:44.400 --> 26:47.597
Yes, you can, and I can help you.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.673
Coffee?
- Yes, please.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.159
Well, naturally, I want to provide
for my children.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.156
And do right by Karen.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.754
Give her everything she's entitled to.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.473
We had many happy years together.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.994
I want the settlement to reflect that,

27:10.080 --> 27:14.232
not just the dreadful few months
that led to the demise of our marriage.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.757
I've had other clients who have taken
that view, Mr Marsden. Not many.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.149
One, in particular, who insisted upon it.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.038
He wanted to maintain his wife and children
in the comfort

27:24.120 --> 27:26.634
to which they'd become accustomed.
- Yes. Exactly.

27:26.720 --> 27:30.713
He now has to earn 100000 pounds
before he can buy himself a cup of tea.

27:31.760 --> 27:34.638
Good grief. How much does he earn?

27:35.680 --> 27:38.035
A little bit more than that. Not much.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.599
Not enough.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.795
So are you still feeling quite
as charitable?

27:56.400 --> 27:58.072
Hello?

27:58.160 --> 27:59.912
Oh, just a minute.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.752
Mum, you don't have to do that.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.798
Oh, thank you, son.
- No, I mean answer the phone.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.632
It's not for you.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.472
Jo, telephone!

28:08.560 --> 28:10.198
<i>Coming.</i>

28:10.280 --> 28:12.236
The bed won't make itself.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.149
Thanks.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.754
I'll put the meal on.
- It's OK, I'll do it.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.398
Hello?

28:21.480 --> 28:23.038
Jo?

28:23.120 --> 28:25.475
Hi, it's me...Ramona.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.597
Listen. You know the health club
where you work?

28:28.680 --> 28:31.148
Adam tells me it is Ashdown Lodge, no?

28:31.240 --> 28:32.912
Yeah, that's right.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.551
Is it possible that you could get me
a membership there? For free?

28:37.640 --> 28:41.189
You want to get fit?
- Yeah. Maybe.

28:41.280 --> 28:45.319
They don't give us free memberships.
Probably can't even get a discount.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.868
But I could smuggle you into
my aerobics class.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.599
Ah, but, you see, it's swimming I like.

28:50.680 --> 28:54.514
Aerobics is just as good.
- But it's swimming I like.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.194
Well, there is a council pool.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.838
Oh...

28:58.920 --> 29:01.878
OK, not to worry.
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

29:21.800 --> 29:25.190
I thought when we had a baby,
life would just be wonderful.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.236
Whatever gave you that idea?

29:27.320 --> 29:30.118
Television, I suppose. Especially the ads.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.116
Well, the first year is hell.

29:34.360 --> 29:37.989
Come to think of it,
the next two years aren't much better.

29:39.320 --> 29:43.108
Then, not long after that, your wife
leaves you and takes the kid with her.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.156
Don't joke about it.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.595
I wasn't.
- Oh, yeah.

29:47.680 --> 29:49.033
Sorry.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.350
Still, at least you got your life back.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.716
Missing your freedom, are you?
- No, I'm missing Rachel.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.438
She's like this mad person.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.032
Not so much.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.316
Always on edge.

30:06.400 --> 30:10.359
She doesn't mother him, she smothers him.
I don't get a look in.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.270
She just doesn't have time for me.

30:22.600 --> 30:26.036
You know what they say.
Two's company, three's a crowd.

30:27.080 --> 30:30.993
Especially when the third is Pete's mum.
It's not like I've got anything against her.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.548
I guess we do always have clean clothes.

30:33.640 --> 30:39.476
But it's just...she's always there, you know?
- It must be difficult for you to be yourself.

30:40.560 --> 30:44.838
<i>Pete's reverted to being her little boy.
He won't let me touch him.</i>

30:44.920 --> 30:47.434
It's putting a tremendous strain on us.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.272
Oh, really? Are you rowing?

30:49.360 --> 30:53.672
We would but it's hard to shout at somebody
when you've got to speak in whispers.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.355
I've tried leaving details
of sheltered accommodation around.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.000
She doesn't seem to get the message.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.832
Jo, will you stop doing that please?

31:01.920 --> 31:05.469
Why? He loves it. Don't you?
- No, stop it. Stop it!

31:05.560 --> 31:09.394
He obviously doesn't like doing it.
Shaken Baby Syndrome.

31:09.480 --> 31:10.833
Sorry.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.072
What?!

31:38.360 --> 31:42.638
You're suing me for divorce? Why?
- Because you committed adultery, David.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.951
If you think about it,
that caused the breakdown of our marriage.

31:46.040 --> 31:50.079
Look, it's a formality. It doesn't
mean anything. - Then why do it?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.674
Who the hell is Tom Bradshaw?
He's not our lawyer.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.069
No, I know. I was advised to get my own.

31:55.160 --> 31:59.915
Who by? - Karen? Ellie's banged
her knee on something.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.070
Oh, darling.
- You...

32:02.160 --> 32:04.151
Hello there, David.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.196
Get your hands off my daughter.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.917
What's he doing here?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.877
David, he was passing.

32:14.960 --> 32:18.111
I bet you've been seeing him all along.
- No, I haven't.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.156
David...
- Shut up!

32:20.240 --> 32:22.196
I've nothing to say to you.

32:23.240 --> 32:24.832
Or you for that matter.

32:24.920 --> 32:26.672
David...

32:26.760 --> 32:27.988
David!

32:38.480 --> 32:41.438
There you go. Go and play in there.
Good girl.

32:41.520 --> 32:44.478
I'm sorry. I had no idea it was
going to be David.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.872
It's not your fault.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.514
Anyway, it's probably a good thing he knows.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.556
These are beautiful.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.596
Good thing he knows what?

33:00.640 --> 33:02.835
That we're seeing each other again.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.834
We are going to, aren't we?

33:09.920 --> 33:11.876
Oh, yes.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.993
I missed you.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.712
Mummy, I'm hungry.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.756
OK, I'm onto it.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.832
Pete.
- What?

33:41.920 --> 33:43.672
Your mum.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.716
She's hoovering again.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.638
Audrey. Audrey!

34:02.520 --> 34:04.715
Hello, dear. Can't you sleep either?

34:04.800 --> 34:06.552
I'll do that in the morning.

34:06.640 --> 34:10.235
It doesn't need doing. It's my arthritis.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.275
It's terrible. Keeps me awake.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.315
Hmm, me too.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.879
Really?

34:15.960 --> 34:17.916
Well, you're so youn...

34:18.000 --> 34:19.956
Oh, I see.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.315
This isn't really working out, is it?

34:32.400 --> 34:34.755
You'd like me to leave, wouldn't you?

34:34.840 --> 34:37.717
No. No, you can stay as long as you want.

34:38.760 --> 34:42.639
You're very sweet. Not very good
at lying, mind.

34:42.719 --> 34:44.472
I'm sorry.

34:44.560 --> 34:48.348
It's just...well,
Pete and I haven't been married very long.

34:48.440 --> 34:51.079
Yeah, it all happened quite quickly,
didn't it?

34:51.159 --> 34:54.436
You don't approve?
- Oh, well.

34:55.480 --> 34:59.837
When I was young,
you were engaged for at least a year.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.558
You had to save up.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.637
Nowadays, people get married
at the drop of a hat.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.270
And divorced as easily.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.072
You must miss your grandson.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.076
I do love Pete, you know.

35:25.120 --> 35:29.079
He's very lucky. You're a lovely girl.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.076
Much nicer than Jenny.

35:35.920 --> 35:37.478
You won't hurt him, will you?

35:37.560 --> 35:39.516
Of course I won't.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.515
He's all I have.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.669
Nice here, innit? Bit crowded.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.716
Well, go to your own room.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.917
You thought her ex was the last threat,
didn't you?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.638
You know about him?

36:11.720 --> 36:14.154
We talk. Anyway, you're wrong.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.755
You know she's got another bloke?
- No. Who?

36:17.840 --> 36:21.515
Me, you moron. She loves me.
- Well, I love you.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.319
But she loves me. You don't even come close.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.153
Bollocks.
- Yeah, you're right.

36:27.240 --> 36:30.437
If she had to make the choice,
you would win hands down.

36:30.520 --> 36:32.078
As if!

36:33.160 --> 36:35.196
What are you doing?
- Need more room.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.077
Cut it out, will you?
- Coming through.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.832
Adam, what are you doing?

36:42.400 --> 36:44.152
He kicked me out of bed.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.196
Don't be ridiculous.

36:46.280 --> 36:51.718
Look, if you can't sleep properly, go and sleep
in the nursery, but don't wake us up.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.518
OK, love.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.759
What are we going to do about your sleeping?

37:00.840 --> 37:02.831
Have you been to see your doctor?

37:02.920 --> 37:06.117
Oh, that man is hopeless.

37:06.200 --> 37:10.239
How can you train for six years
and know nothing?

37:10.320 --> 37:12.151
He's put me on pills.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.435
Green ones, yellow ones, blue ones.

37:14.520 --> 37:17.318
None of them are any good.
All they do is bung me up.

37:18.400 --> 37:21.358
Have you ever considered...drugs?

37:22.400 --> 37:25.756
I told you. Green ones, yellow ones.
- Marijuana.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.796
Cannabis.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.116
Dear God!

37:31.200 --> 37:34.636
You and Peter, you're not drug
addicts, are you?

37:34.720 --> 37:36.676
No! No!

37:36.760 --> 37:39.194
Well, I mean, I have tried it.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.719
And Peter?

37:44.320 --> 37:46.788
I don't think I should answer that for him.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.836
Do you?

37:48.920 --> 37:50.876
You're a good girl.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.315
Despite your drug habit.

37:54.360 --> 37:59.593
I can't guarantee that it will cure your
arthritis, but it might help you sleep.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.636
Where do you get it from?

38:01.720 --> 38:03.312
Adam, usually.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.072
Adam?

38:05.160 --> 38:08.391
Such a nice boy! A drug dealer?

38:08.480 --> 38:12.792
No, he gets it from someone else.
That's how it works.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.469
So...do you want to try it?

38:50.960 --> 38:53.918
This takes me back.
- Not that far.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.956
A lifetime ago.

38:59.440 --> 39:01.670
Here, let me get my breasts out.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.035
Rachel, steady on!

39:04.120 --> 39:05.758
What?

39:05.840 --> 39:07.717
Don't you think it's a bit public?

39:07.800 --> 39:10.394
Can you not wait until we get home?
- He's hungry now.

39:10.480 --> 39:12.038
Who?
- Matthew!

39:12.120 --> 39:13.872
What did you think I meant?

39:18.800 --> 39:21.792
<i>Oh, he's a beauty.</i>

39:21.880 --> 39:23.757
So are you, sweetheart.

39:23.840 --> 39:27.992
Pete, I am telling you, this drop-dead
gorgeous woman was coming on to me.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.799
Because of Matthew.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

39:30.880 --> 39:33.519
The babe is a babe magnet.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.875
How old is he?
- He's just over three months.

39:36.920 --> 39:41.232
Your first?
- Actually, he's my sister's.

39:41.320 --> 39:44.915
She's a single mum
and I like to help out sometimes.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.468
Really?
- Mmm...

39:47.560 --> 39:51.314
Not that I can take advantage of it.
- Not that you'd want to.

39:51.400 --> 39:53.038
Wouldn't I?

39:54.120 --> 39:55.838
Do you have any of your own?

39:55.920 --> 39:57.876
No. Not yet.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.473
You have to find the father first,
don't you?

40:03.560 --> 40:05.312
Yes.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.356
And then there's all the practice.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.510
That's the best part, isn't it?

40:11.360 --> 40:14.511
No, of course I wouldn't!

40:14.600 --> 40:19.754
I still miss it, you know,
the old ha-ha, but I miss Rachel more.

40:20.800 --> 40:24.190
I live near here.
- Hmmm...

40:24.280 --> 40:26.635
Oh, sorry.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.877
It's his mum.
Probably wondering where we've got to.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.552
Oh, well.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.629
No.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.632
You tosser.
- Shut it!

40:38.680 --> 40:39.908
Rach.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.039
Where are you? - I'm in the park.
I took Matthew for a walk.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.437
Have you got his coat on?
- Yeah.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.476
Well, then, why have I got it here?

40:51.520 --> 40:53.476
Because I bought him a new one.

40:53.560 --> 40:58.315
I don't know why. Listen, don't be long.
He'll need his feed soon, all right?

41:00.760 --> 41:02.318
Bye.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.793
Right. Mothercare.

41:06.880 --> 41:12.557
It's like...she died giving birth
and this stranger took her place.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.837
Well, it gets better.
- When?

41:15.920 --> 41:17.797
Honey, I'm home.

41:17.880 --> 41:20.440
Hi.
- Hey. Oh, hey, Adam. How's it going?

41:20.520 --> 41:22.158
Oh, you know. Parenthood.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.073
Er...well, actually, no, I don't.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.039
Erm...Pete,
your mum wants to have a word with you.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.838
What? Now?

41:30.920 --> 41:35.118
I don't know. But tell her I'm with Adam
and I'm sure she'll think of something.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.714
Eh?
- Well, go on. She's in the bathroom.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.911
And don't forget to knock.

41:47.920 --> 41:51.117
I'm in the bath.
- Mum, Jo said you wanted a word with me.

41:51.200 --> 41:53.919
What about?
- I don't know, she didn't say.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.676
And Adam's here.
- Adam? Oh, stay there a minute.

41:58.760 --> 42:01.479
Don't go away.

42:01.560 --> 42:03.198
No.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.076
Mum, towel!

42:07.160 --> 42:10.072
Oh, sorry!

42:12.760 --> 42:16.036
Erm...I'm all out at the minute.
Is this for you and Pete?

42:16.120 --> 42:18.270
Can you keep a secret?

42:18.360 --> 42:19.952
You know me.

42:20.040 --> 42:23.316
Yeah. Well, he mustn't know.

42:23.400 --> 42:26.358
It's a surprise to celebrate
our anniversary.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.958
Our 14-week anniversary.

42:33.600 --> 42:35.955
Right...right.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.997
Do you like your new toy, Joshy?

42:49.080 --> 42:52.755
Yes, it's great. - You'd better press
Pause. Tea's nearly ready.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.994
Oh, hi, Ramona.
- Hi, David. Sorry I'm a little late.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.718
Ah, no problem.

43:04.800 --> 43:07.553
Wow, who had the birthday?

43:13.200 --> 43:14.553
So how's things at home?

43:16.680 --> 43:18.193
Mark's around, is he?

43:19.720 --> 43:22.359
David, I don't know. Maybe.

43:22.440 --> 43:23.873
Come on, children. Vamos.

43:23.960 --> 43:26.110
No, they're staying here tonight.
- Sorry?

43:26.200 --> 43:28.316
Dinner was cancelled, so they can stay.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.958
But it's not your night, is it?

43:30.040 --> 43:32.713
I always... I always have Wednesdays.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.394
Yeah, but two nights.
Does Karen know about this?

43:35.480 --> 43:39.473
You can tell her when you get back.
- Oh, David, I don't know.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.994
You know, maybe I phone her.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.036
Er...Ramona...

43:45.400 --> 43:47.709
..I am their father.

43:51.800 --> 43:55.031
Karen mentioned
that you wanted to join our health club.

43:55.120 --> 43:57.395
Yeah.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.555
Yeah.

44:01.640 --> 44:04.518
David, are you trying to bribe me?

44:04.600 --> 44:09.913
No, Ramona. No, it's a reward.
A reward for good service.

44:11.040 --> 44:14.999
If I was trying to bribe you,
I'd be offering you money for information

44:15.080 --> 44:19.631
about how often Karen is seeing that man.
Times and places and so forth.

44:23.680 --> 44:25.955
I don't know if you need...money.

44:26.040 --> 44:29.999
David, I will not be your spy.

44:34.320 --> 44:38.154
However, I will take your message
to Karen...this time.

44:38.240 --> 44:39.992
But that's it, OK?

44:40.080 --> 44:42.275
And er...

44:42.360 --> 44:45.750
I will have membership of the health club,
thank you very much.

44:47.640 --> 44:51.758
David, I can smell something burning.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.671
Bugger!

44:55.960 --> 44:58.679
<i>Audrey,
you know you didn't have to come with me.</i>

44:58.760 --> 45:03.675
I'm not letting you go wandering off into
some drug den on your own, young lady.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.990
Especially when it's on my account.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.756
Are you sure this is the place?

45:10.840 --> 45:14.071
Well, Adam did say a minicab company
off the Seaport Road.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.628
Yeah, but this isn't the only one.

45:16.720 --> 45:18.870
It is behind an Indian restaurant.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.869
<i>Right. This should tell us.</i>

45:37.640 --> 45:38.993
Bingo.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.432
That's the place.

45:46.640 --> 45:50.394
How can you be sure? - Well, they arrived
by car and they left by car.

45:50.480 --> 45:55.110
Obviously they weren't booking a cab.
OK, you wait here. I'll just be a few minutes.

45:55.200 --> 45:57.156
OK?
- All right.

46:02.040 --> 46:05.112
So...do you need a hand
with the washing-up, then?

46:17.360 --> 46:20.557
I was going to leave it until
tomorrow, actually.

46:20.640 --> 46:22.198
So was I.

46:28.800 --> 46:31.917
Mark...you can't stay.

46:33.320 --> 46:35.276
Why?

46:35.360 --> 46:37.316
Cos of the kids?

46:38.920 --> 46:40.876
Partly, yeah.

46:40.960 --> 46:43.599
I just... I don't want to rush into things.

46:44.920 --> 46:46.876
Again.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.916
Well...

46:50.320 --> 46:54.108
Having paid the price for
not respecting that wish last time...

47:01.240 --> 47:03.708
Hi.
- Hi.

47:04.840 --> 47:08.469
Where are the children? - David's.
He wanted them to stay another night.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.152
What?

47:21.280 --> 47:23.714
What if they think you want a taxi?

47:23.800 --> 47:25.756
Audrey!

47:25.840 --> 47:28.832
Adam said we have to ask for Grandad.

47:28.920 --> 47:30.114
Who?

47:30.200 --> 47:31.918
Unless he was winding me up.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.956
Yes?

47:38.040 --> 47:39.996
Oh, hi...

47:40.080 --> 47:42.435
I'm here to see Grandad.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.118
Step under the light.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.196
You're having a laugh?

47:50.280 --> 47:53.431
No. No. We're deadly serious.

47:53.520 --> 47:55.988
And a little bit frightened,
if we're honest.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.596
Let them in.

48:23.960 --> 48:27.236
Hi. Er...we're here to see Grandad.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.272
Take a seat.

48:55.280 --> 48:56.872
Hi.

48:56.960 --> 49:01.317
I'm Jo and this is my grandma, Grandad!

49:01.400 --> 49:03.709
I don't need to know your names.

49:05.400 --> 49:07.755
We're here to buy some dope.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.958
Colombian gold.

49:17.040 --> 49:20.112
Panama red.

49:22.080 --> 49:24.036
Thai stick.

49:25.480 --> 49:27.391
And hydroponic.

49:27.480 --> 49:30.119
Is that organic?

49:30.200 --> 49:33.431
It's powerful, is what it is.

49:34.640 --> 49:36.915
Will lift your roof off.

49:38.480 --> 49:41.278
No. I don't think so.

49:42.360 --> 49:45.193
How about some of the Colombian?

49:45.280 --> 49:47.350
I like their coffee.

49:47.440 --> 49:49.510
This is for you?

49:49.600 --> 49:51.238
I can't sleep.

49:52.400 --> 49:54.038
Old age.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.872
I'm the same, you know.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.551
A smoke before bed really does the trick.

50:07.840 --> 50:09.831
Is 20 a bag.

50:10.920 --> 50:14.754
But, since it's for your gran,
we'll say ten.

50:16.760 --> 50:20.469
Call it...a pensioner's discount.

50:22.160 --> 50:24.116
Can you feel anything yet?

50:25.320 --> 50:28.471
My toes.
- That's a good start.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.676
You sure Peter won't find us?

50:33.760 --> 50:36.149
No. No, I checked. He's fast asleep.

50:36.240 --> 50:41.360
You know...I used to smoke,
when I was a factory girl.

50:42.640 --> 50:45.154
Oh, but we did fancy ourselves.

50:45.240 --> 50:47.196
So did the men.

50:50.280 --> 50:51.998
Ooh.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.036
I could murder a chocolate biscuit.

51:07.360 --> 51:09.794
Hiya. Are you coming up?

51:09.880 --> 51:11.552
Yeah. In a minute.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.956
What?

51:16.040 --> 51:19.237
Are you smoking a joint?
- No.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.072
My mother's in that kitchen.

51:21.160 --> 51:23.469
I know.

51:23.560 --> 51:25.994
Jo! I thought you wanted to make
a good impression?!

51:26.080 --> 51:29.629
Pete, don't worry.
- Jesus, I mean, Jenny drank, but this...

51:29.720 --> 51:32.280
Oh. Jenny again.
- What?

51:32.360 --> 51:35.557
Do you wish you were still married to her?
- No.

51:35.640 --> 51:39.315
But at least she didn't embarrass me
in front of my own mother. Well, not often.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.709
Put it out. Put it out!

51:43.800 --> 51:45.836
Peter, what are you doing up?

51:45.920 --> 51:47.672
Nothing. And neither's Jo.

51:47.760 --> 51:50.115
And that smell, it's incense. Australian.

51:50.200 --> 51:52.316
Don't be ridiculous.

51:52.400 --> 51:57.155
I asked Jo to roll it for me.
- To help her sleep.

51:57.240 --> 52:00.596
Yeah. And, do you know?
I think it's doing the trick.

52:00.680 --> 52:03.319
I can feel my joints relaxing.

52:04.640 --> 52:05.709
Joints!

52:12.680 --> 52:14.636
Makes you hungry though.

52:17.080 --> 52:19.230
I thought you were asleep.

52:19.320 --> 52:21.470
I couldn't.

52:21.560 --> 52:23.676
Oh.
