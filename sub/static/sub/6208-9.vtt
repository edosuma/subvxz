WEBVTT

00:01.190 --> 00:02.840
And we are definitely..

00:06.780 --> 00:08.260
..getting rid of this.

00:08.260 --> 00:09.830
My cuirass!

00:09.830 --> 00:10.880
Where did you find it?

00:10.880 --> 00:12.130
You can't throw that away.

00:12.130 --> 00:16.230
Give me a brake Hilda,
you haven't used your cuirass for centuries.

00:16.230 --> 00:20.090
Oh I've just been waiting for it
To come back into style.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.790
Hm-mm, and when were you going to use this?

00:22.800 --> 00:27.330
Oh my mace!
Oh remember the good times?

00:27.540 --> 00:29.250
Party!

00:29.260 --> 00:31.960
Only you would be nostalgic
for the dark-ages.

00:33.530 --> 00:36.780
I never want to trip over this again.

00:36.780 --> 00:37.880
My cannon!

00:37.980 --> 00:41.300
Why would you want to keep an instrument
of destruction in the house?

00:41.400 --> 00:42.600
Sentimental reasons?

00:43.030 --> 00:44.850
We don't have room for all this junk.

00:44.850 --> 00:46.710
Junk!
You call this junk?

00:46.710 --> 00:47.910
Put the mace down.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.320
All right, I'll make you a deal.

00:50.330 --> 00:54.540
You have a week, if you use these things
you can keep them if not, they go.

00:54.540 --> 00:56.940
Fine, I accept because it just so happens that..

00:56.940 --> 00:59.830
you selected three items that are very useful to me.

00:59.930 --> 01:02.960
Now if you'll excuse me
I'm going to put my cannon away.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.500
Okay! Okay! I'll clean my room.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.410
See?
I told you it was useful.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.510
Sabrina, the Teenage Witch
1x05: Geek Like Me

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.530 --> 01:36.540
..And the best way to remember it is,
mandible has a "B"

01:36.540 --> 01:38.230
and that stands for bottom.

01:39.290 --> 01:40.970
But how do we remember maxilla?

01:41.170 --> 01:42.390
It's the other one.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.380
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.180
before you bolt,
Gordie has a very important announcement that..

01:48.180 --> 01:50.500
just might change your lives.
Take it away.

01:50.510 --> 01:53.590
Okay, in fifteen eighty-one Galileo began..

01:53.590 --> 01:54.790
Make it quick Gordie.

01:56.090 --> 01:57.900
umping to the end of the millennium,

01:57.900 --> 02:00.360
the Science Club will be
every day after school to

02:00.360 --> 02:02.150
to celebrate national science week.

02:02.150 --> 02:04.150
You mean national geek week.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.760
We hope you'll all join us.
Any questions?

02:06.760 --> 02:09.009
Yeah, can we get outa here?

02:09.370 --> 02:12.420
Sure. Oh, sign up early,
win a ham.

02:12.490 --> 02:15.150
It's a tough room, Gordie.
Believe me, I know.

02:20.150 --> 02:21.410
Hey Gordie,

02:21.410 --> 02:23.610
why don't you come up
with a scientific explanation

02:23.610 --> 02:25.410
for why you're such a loser?

02:25.880 --> 02:28.150
- Wesson head.
- Zit master.

02:30.390 --> 02:32.470
Poor Gordie, I feel so bad for him.

02:32.470 --> 02:34.720
Well he needs to be
more in touch with his audience.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.020
No one knows or cares what Galileo
did in fifteen eighty-one.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.860
He entered the university of Pisa.

02:40.680 --> 02:43.180
Sabrina, I didn?t know you were a geek.

02:43.180 --> 02:45.690
I'm not, I just like science.
Does that make me a geek?

02:46.120 --> 02:47.390
No, I guess not.

02:47.390 --> 02:50.230
And, you know, I?m even thinking of going
by the Science Club after school.

02:50.230 --> 02:51.630
Okay now that could be a problem.

02:52.190 --> 02:53.230
Why?

02:53.230 --> 02:54.580
Because this is high school.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.600
If you show passion or enthusiasm
for anything you're doomed

02:57.600 --> 03:00.480
You might as well be wearing
a big "Kick Me" sign.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.170
Hey Harvey. Help us out,
Sabrina's got a problem.

03:07.170 --> 03:08.170
What's up?

03:08.180 --> 03:10.030
Well I was thinking
of joining the Science Club.

03:10.030 --> 03:12.090
Really!
I didn't know you were a geek?

03:12.190 --> 03:15.220
I'm not. That's the problem,
I'm afraid everyone will think I am.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.820
Well they will.

03:17.390 --> 03:20.660
I explained that we can't
change the whole system just for her.

03:20.660 --> 03:22.370
Well why does everyone
have to be stuffed in a category? I mean..

03:22.370 --> 03:23.840
I don't get it, look around.

03:23.840 --> 03:25.540
The cheerleaders only
eat with the cheerleaders,

03:25.740 --> 03:28.720
The geek's only eat with the geek's.
I just don't want to be labelled.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.070
You have no choice.

03:30.070 --> 03:32.190
You have a grace period as a new student

03:32.190 --> 03:33.670
but pretty soon you're going
to be stereotyped.

03:34.230 --> 03:36.320
- Well what are you guys?
- Well I'm a quasi-jock..

03:36.320 --> 03:39.600
with semi-literary aspirations
and a hint of denialism.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.040
If only it was that simple for me.
Jenny, what are you?

03:43.140 --> 03:46.610
I tried to be an outsider
but I didn't really fit in.

03:47.050 --> 03:50.100
Now Libby calls me a freak
and I?m okay with that.

03:50.670 --> 03:52.140
Well why can't I just be me?

03:52.530 --> 03:53.760
That's a pretty small group.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.860
- We've got spirit,
- Let's hear it.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.750
Let's go! Let's go!

04:03.000 --> 04:04.890
I think we should take
her advice and just go.

04:05.420 --> 04:07.100
It's spirit week at Westbridge,

04:07.100 --> 04:10.350
we're playing Eastbridge this weekend
and we're number one.

04:10.660 --> 04:12.690
Yeah, in turn overs and penalties.

04:13.350 --> 04:15.830
We'll be wearing our uniforms
every day this week..

04:15.830 --> 04:21.070
and leading cheers at lunch reminding you
to support our team. Ready?

04:21.269 --> 04:27.510
Okay! East meets West
and we know who's the best.

04:29.690 --> 04:31.930
I don't get it.
I mean to me that looks geeky.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.180
How can she do that and still be so popular?

04:34.190 --> 04:36.500
Libby's not popular, she's powerful.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.500
Well how did she get the power?

04:37.500 --> 04:40.960
She seized it and as long as
there are people backing her up she'll..

04:40.960 --> 04:43.050
keep it, it's all very Stalin.

04:44.020 --> 04:46.040
I don't know what you guys are talking about,

04:46.040 --> 04:47.540
Libby's always been nice to me.

04:47.740 --> 04:49.190
I'm going to get more tatter-tots.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.500
I'll go with you.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.490
See you tomorrow. We're number one.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.900
Watch where you're going geek!

05:00.020 --> 05:01.750
You got my uniform wet.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.510
I'm sorry.

05:03.610 --> 05:06.900
Oh you are so transferred.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.220
Libby, lay off him. It was an accident.

05:09.230 --> 05:11.520
It's just like a freak to defend a geek.

05:11.830 --> 05:14.480
Maybe the two of you can get
weekend jobs at the carnival.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.200
- Hi Harvey.
- Hi

05:19.320 --> 05:20.720
See? She's nice.

05:23.060 --> 05:25.260
Sabrina,
I thought you were going to the Science Club?

05:25.560 --> 05:28.980
I am, in a minute
as per our previous discussion.

05:29.380 --> 05:31.280
Oh got it. Later.

05:33.630 --> 05:37.120
Well this is a delightful turn out.
Five, the same as last year

05:37.360 --> 05:39.580
which means none of you were killed
at summer camp. Ha ha.

05:42.750 --> 05:45.130
I see Sherman's sporting a new look,
did you get contacts?

05:45.140 --> 05:46.790
No, someone stole my glasses.

05:47.420 --> 05:51.720
All right. Well er let's begin by discussing
the biggest scientific breakthrough in recent months,

05:51.780 --> 05:56.060
the possible evidence of life on Mars.
what does this discovery mean to us?

05:56.720 --> 05:57.370
Howard?

05:57.370 --> 05:59.820
It means that the governments
been covering this up for years..

05:59.820 --> 06:02.840
and that Scully and Mulder are right,
the truth is out there!

06:03.650 --> 06:05.200
All right, calm down, calm down.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.380
Look
how many times do we have to go over this?

06:07.590 --> 06:11.660
The X files is fiction,
Scully and Mulder are played by actors.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.100
Oh now come on, don?t get upset.

06:14.930 --> 06:16.350
Hi, is this Science Club?

06:16.830 --> 06:18.920
Did you leave something
in your desk, Sabrina?

06:18.920 --> 06:21.990
No, I was thinking of joining,
unless you're all filled up.

06:22.640 --> 06:25.300
Not at all, everyone's welcome.
Have a seat.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.290
There's a girl in Science Club,
don't panic.

06:28.780 --> 06:30.250
Hey, how's it going?

06:34.190 --> 06:36.270
I never knew a pickle
could be used as a light bulb.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.530
Oh it's super-versatile.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.270
Bye guys, see you later.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.260
What are you doing here so late?

06:43.560 --> 06:45.170
Was there a meeting of the freak society?

06:45.170 --> 06:46.430
Libby why don't you just..

06:46.430 --> 06:47.850
Hey, great having you in Science Club Sabrina.

06:47.850 --> 06:49.720
Don't forget to bring your rock tumbler tomorrow.

06:51.790 --> 06:54.020
You went to Science Club!

06:55.260 --> 06:59.140
That is too perfect,
you're a geek in freaks clothing.

06:59.140 --> 07:00.390
I am not a geek!

07:02.010 --> 07:03.470
That doesn't prove anything.

07:04.130 --> 07:05.690
Oh here let me help you.

07:06.780 --> 07:08.660
See you later... geek.

07:18.180 --> 07:22.820
Look it still fits and it's great
for lounging around the house.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.590
That doesn't count as a use.

07:25.590 --> 07:26.590
Why not?

07:26.590 --> 07:28.790
No one wears metal after labour day.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.760
Aunt Hilda, what's the range on your cannon?

07:31.760 --> 07:34.770
- I'll get it, we'll find out.
- Hilda! will you please sit down?

07:36.660 --> 07:40.620
Sabrina, a cannon is not a solution
for a land based problem.

07:45.570 --> 07:46.850
What's going on?

07:46.850 --> 07:49.490
Libby caught me coming
out of Science Club.

07:49.490 --> 07:52.440
You went to Science Club?
Oh that's wonderful.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.950
No, it's not.
Now Libby thinks I'm a complete geek

07:54.950 --> 07:57.580
I knew this would happen,
it's Zelda?s influence.

07:57.580 --> 08:00.460
I begged you to watch TV with me
so you'd be normal.

08:00.460 --> 08:01.660
Oh be quiet.

08:01.860 --> 08:04.480
Hey! It's dark in here.

08:05.850 --> 08:08.930
Now, it shouldn't bother you what Libby says.

08:08.930 --> 08:10.750
It shouldn't but it does.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.400
I wanna use my magic to teach Libby a lesson.

08:13.670 --> 08:15.490
That sounds very constructive.

08:15.490 --> 08:17.050
I'm going to give her a snout

08:17.260 --> 08:19.330
Oh good idea!

08:21.110 --> 08:24.380
You need to talk to my friend Cicero,
he's an expert on these matters.

08:24.390 --> 08:25.800
Come on, we'll look him up in the book.

08:26.390 --> 08:27.860
- Are you coming Hilda?
- Yes...

08:30.390 --> 08:32.330
No... I can't.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.210
My outfits too heavy..

08:34.409 --> 08:35.909
but it's very useful.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.020
See, when you said
look him up in the book

08:39.020 --> 08:41.700
- I thought you ment phone book.
- No, magic book.

08:42.020 --> 08:46.060
Cicero is figure three-A.
He's one of the ancient geeks.

08:46.060 --> 08:48.550
Oh there he is.
Hello Cicero.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.010
There's a girl looking at me. 
Mmm, don?t panic.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.220
Ask him what he'd do,
he's very knowledgeable.

08:55.740 --> 08:57.770
He was the first registered chrome.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.410
Hey Cicero, I'm Sabrina
and I have a question.

09:01.510 --> 09:02.970
Ask away but make it quick.

09:03.070 --> 09:07.060
If the centurions catch me here
it's a guaranteed swirly in the aqueduct.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.060
Okay. See there's this girl in my school..

09:09.170 --> 09:11.790
and she keeps calling me a geek
and I really don't like it.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.230
I suggest that you ignore her,
okay. Bye bye.

09:14.230 --> 09:18.650
No wait! I can't ignore her,
no one can ignore her. You've gotta help.

09:18.650 --> 09:21.490
Well there are two ways
to teach her a lesson.

09:21.490 --> 09:23.720
The first is to just give her a snout.

09:23.720 --> 09:25.770
- I knew it.
- What's the second?

09:25.770 --> 09:29.210
Give her a taste of her own medicine,
turn her into a geek.

09:29.210 --> 09:32.760
She'll see how it feels and she'll learn that it's
what's inside that really counts.

09:32.860 --> 09:34.300
But how can I do that?

09:34.300 --> 09:36.530
A simple spell, just..
..point.

09:36.530 --> 09:37.730
Like this?

09:38.250 --> 09:41.540
Well actually you just have to point.
My glasses were slipping.

09:42.090 --> 09:44.160
Thank you Cicero,
you've been a big help.

09:47.060 --> 09:48.710
Nice move four eyes.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.580
- Hi Libby.
- Are you okay?

09:55.580 --> 09:58.080
Oh my eye balls have started itching,

09:58.700 --> 10:01.100
it must be my contacts. I'll be right back.

10:02.490 --> 10:03.980
Libby wears contacts?

10:19.570 --> 10:20.810
Much better.

10:21.980 --> 10:23.020
Oh my god!

10:23.220 --> 10:25.300
What happened to you?
You look totally weird.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.790
I took my contacts out.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.620
But what did you do to your hair?

10:29.430 --> 10:31.510
Oh, well I ran my fingers through
it a couple of times.

10:31.610 --> 10:32.950
Doesn't it look shiny?

10:32.960 --> 10:35.450
- More like greasy.
- What's with the uniform?

10:36.300 --> 10:40.020
I was cold so I pulled up my socks.
It's function over fashion.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.220
Since when!

10:41.630 --> 10:44.440
Oh, the bell! We'll be late for class.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.020
We're always late for class,
that's what we do.

10:47.020 --> 10:50.290
But we might miss something
that's on a test, come on.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.860
What are you looking at?

10:55.870 --> 10:57.280
Hey Harvey, Jenny, over here.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.190
You look happy.

10:59.190 --> 11:00.410
What's going on?

11:00.410 --> 11:03.210
Oh just a new world order..
and butterscotch pudding.

11:03.210 --> 11:05.410
Oh boy, butterscotch pudding.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.260
Hair check, Matt Sabetti's heading this way.

11:11.090 --> 11:12.120
Hi Girls.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.130
Hi.

11:16.010 --> 11:17.720
What was that noise?

11:17.820 --> 11:20.920
My asthma just kicked in,
I need my inhaler.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.520
Get it later,
it's time to cheer.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.300
We've got spirit.

11:25.670 --> 11:26.910
Let's hear it.

11:27.860 --> 11:28.950
Ready?

11:31.340 --> 11:32.480
Okay

11:33.270 --> 11:37.700
East meets West and we know who's the..

11:38.680 --> 11:40.360
You poked me in the eye.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.580
Emergency huddle.

11:41.720 --> 11:42.760
Not you.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.020
You're huddling without me!

11:45.790 --> 11:49.220
You can't huddle without me.
You can't exclude me!

11:49.220 --> 11:50.470
We just did.

11:50.470 --> 11:54.490
You're sitting out spirit week,
Chessler, you're a threat to the whole team.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.170
But where will I go?

11:57.180 --> 11:58.400
Who will I sit with?

11:58.400 --> 12:00.080
I'm sure you'd fit in over there.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.370
I don't think so.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.110
Watch where you're going, geek!

12:08.120 --> 12:10.180
Who do you think you're talking to?

12:10.180 --> 12:12.440
Just because I wear glasses and have asthma

12:12.440 --> 12:15.440
and want to do well in school
does not mean that I'm a..

12:17.590 --> 12:18.670
 Oh no!

12:21.820 --> 12:25.710
There's something different about Libby,
did she change her hair?

12:26.870 --> 12:31.550
Ready? okay.
It's spirit week and Libby's now a geek.

12:35.370 --> 12:39.880
People are laughing at Libby.
I know it's mean to say this, but Yes!

12:40.370 --> 12:42.660
Hey, she's always been nice to me.

12:44.060 --> 12:45.320
I'm going to go talk to her.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.960
But whatever Libby's going through
doesn't involve you.

12:48.500 --> 12:49.760
Who said it did?

12:49.760 --> 12:52.730
It's not like I feel responsible,
I'm just a really empathetic person.

12:53.270 --> 12:54.280
Gotta go.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.290
Libby?

13:00.660 --> 13:03.130
I know you're in here,
I can hear you wheezing.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.950
What do you want?

13:06.950 --> 13:09.430
- I just came to talk.
- Don't you mean gloat?

13:09.430 --> 13:11.270
I can talk and gloat at the same time.

13:12.650 --> 13:14.320
Look Libby, I thought
you might need a friend.

13:14.420 --> 13:17.070
Why, because all my other friends dumped me?

13:17.480 --> 13:21.000
Don't they realise that geeks have needs
and wants and feelings?

13:21.350 --> 13:23.940
If you trip us do we not fall?

13:23.940 --> 13:26.944
If you prick us do we
not scream and pass out?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.470
And what did that teach you?

13:28.470 --> 13:29.730
To hate cheerleaders.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.190
No. It teaches you that
it's what's inside that counts.

13:33.630 --> 13:34.980
That's what I've learned?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.200
Man, I hope so.

13:36.930 --> 13:38.520
Wait a minute, let me process this.

13:38.970 --> 13:44.060
It's what's inside that counts,
so no matter how I look or dress

13:44.060 --> 13:50.470
I'm still me, I'm still Libby Chessler.
This is very exciting.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.010
But not over exciting.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.170
Let's go back to lunch.

14:00.460 --> 14:01.690
Can I sit here?

14:02.350 --> 14:04.780
Relax, I?m one of you.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.380
What's going on, Libby's sitting with the geeks?

14:12.380 --> 14:14.260
See, I told you she was nice.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.430
What did you say to her?

14:16.590 --> 14:18.270
I just told her to be herself.

14:18.430 --> 14:20.040
Let's talk about power.

14:20.410 --> 14:23.030
How to get it; how to keep it.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.210
Hey did you see 'Xena, warrior princess' last night?

14:27.210 --> 14:28.550
Quiet, this is important.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.370
- Are you catching the bus?
- No, I?m going to Science Club.

14:34.820 --> 14:37.050
- Are you sure you wanna broadcast that?
- Yeah I do.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.740
Today the halls are safe for geeks.

14:41.290 --> 14:43.100
But you can't protect them from themselves.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.110
Hey, I brought my rock tumbler.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.320
May we help you?

14:48.320 --> 14:49.730
What are you doing here?

14:49.730 --> 14:53.870
I'm the new president and by the way,
membership is closed.

14:53.870 --> 14:56.500
Science Club is now limited to six people.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.510
That's how many can fit in the space shuttle.

14:58.820 --> 15:00.440
You can't do that. Where's Mr. Pool?

15:00.440 --> 15:04.770
I sent him for Tang and Fig Newtons.
Besides, you don't belong here.

15:05.140 --> 15:07.590
You're not a total geek, is she guys?

15:08.790 --> 15:10.820
Yeah, you never sat with us at lunch.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.910
And what's you eye sight, twenty-twenty?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.520
Well stab me in the back with
a protractor why don't you?

15:16.810 --> 15:18.460
I can't believe you guys are siding with Libby?

15:18.460 --> 15:20.150
She used to make fun of you all the time.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.970
Yeah, but now she's our leader.

15:22.430 --> 15:26.676
- She's not my leader.
- What did you say, Gordie?

15:26.870 --> 15:33.120
I said... you're not my leader...
you, you're pushy and bossy..

15:33.510 --> 15:36.150
..And if Sabrina goes, I go.

15:38.510 --> 15:41.120
- That was very brave of you, Gordie.
- Don't talk, run!

15:48.210 --> 15:51.920
Look Salem, I'm tenderising
the beef with my mace.

15:52.510 --> 15:55.590
It's a deadly weapon and a handy kitchen tool.

15:55.790 --> 15:58.050
Oh please, we?ve all seen the infomercial.

15:58.930 --> 16:00.200
Hi Sabrina.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.470
I just had a big stinky day.

16:02.470 --> 16:04.960
Aunt Hilda, my magic never
works the way I want it to.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.270
Would it make you feel better
to pound some beef? 

16:08.170 --> 16:09.270
Maybe.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.610
Well you'll be happy to know
I got kicked out of the Science Club.

16:12.610 --> 16:13.810
How come?

16:13.920 --> 16:16.190
Because Libby says I'm not a total geek.

16:16.190 --> 16:19.080
I thought you were upset yesterday
because she said that you were one?

16:19.080 --> 16:20.080
Yes. 

16:20.440 --> 16:21.940
There is no pleasing you.

16:22.780 --> 16:25.450
All right, you're a little too good at that.
Let's take a break.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.410
Hey can I lick the mace?

16:27.410 --> 16:30.470
Oh all right but be careful.

16:30.470 --> 16:33.290
Mmm, ouch! But it's worth it.

16:33.860 --> 16:38.130
You know the point was to teach
Libby that it's what's inside that counts

16:38.130 --> 16:41.960
but I just forgot that inside she's just
a manipulative, conniving dictator.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.730
So are you reconsidering the snout?

16:44.730 --> 16:47.510
No, I'm just going to turn her back to normal.

16:48.220 --> 16:50.310
I think I need to pound some more beef.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.460
Hey Cee Cee, nice uniform.

16:54.460 --> 16:57.160
What does the 'W' stand for?
Where's my brain?

16:57.710 --> 16:59.270
Get away you geeks.

16:59.270 --> 17:02.960
Hey look at me, I'm Jill
and I wash my hair everyday.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.849
Shields down, direct hit. Fire again.

17:05.849 --> 17:08.470
Hey, how many cheerleaders
does it take to screw in a pickle?

17:08.470 --> 17:09.750
I don't get it.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.609
You wouldn't.

17:14.109 --> 17:17.369
Did you see that? The cheerleaders
are being teased by the geeks.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.250
- The revolution is upon us.
- I wouldn't be too sure about that.

17:21.579 --> 17:24.800
That's funny, my eye balls stopped itching.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.089
So anyway, I checked out the
radar game check website

17:28.089 --> 17:30.380
and I think I'm going to link it to my home page.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.820
Hey Libby, can I speak with you a moment?

17:32.820 --> 17:35.810
Make it quick, I don't wanna
be seen talking with you.

17:35.810 --> 17:38.620
Okay. Well, y'know I was just wondering 
f you'd tried doing any cheers lately?

17:38.620 --> 17:41.240
- I bet you could.
- Any seal can clap.

17:42.470 --> 17:44.720
I am a higher life form.

17:47.880 --> 17:51.290
I never would have guessed it but
I think Libby really likes being a geek.

17:51.290 --> 17:54.250
Doesn't surprise me. Libby doesn't care
what group she's in, as long as she

17:54.250 --> 17:56.830
can exclude people she's happy.

17:57.690 --> 18:00.270
Jenny, I want you to come to Science Club with me.

18:00.270 --> 18:02.480
Sorry, I'm not into organised science.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.920
- Maybe I can convince you?
- I doubt it.

18:06.190 --> 18:09.040
Aw! I hope I didn't suffer a hematoma.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.920
Save it for club. Come on.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.940
- Hey Harvey.
- Hey guys, what's up?

18:14.940 --> 18:16.340
Do ya wanna come to Science Club?

18:16.350 --> 18:17.350
No way.

18:19.490 --> 18:20.510
Weird,

18:20.890 --> 18:24.850
suddenly I wish I had every episode
of 'Mystery science theatre' on tape.

18:24.850 --> 18:26.690
Hurry up, we're going to be late.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.530
Calm down, I'll be right back. Stay here.

18:42.490 --> 18:46.590
For the good of mankind. I can't look.

18:47.140 --> 18:50.120
And the handwriting recognition on my
Newton turned it into

18:50.130 --> 18:51.990
'Are you afraid of the dork'

18:53.530 --> 18:54.600
I'll get it.

18:56.850 --> 18:59.130
- Hello Mr. Pool.
- Sabrina!

18:59.130 --> 19:00.780
Let's talk Philip K. Dick.

19:02.470 --> 19:05.030
Hey, you can't come in here.

19:05.030 --> 19:06.030
Well of course she can.

19:06.030 --> 19:08.270
And I've brought some friends with me.
Come on guys.

19:09.570 --> 19:10.630
Hello.

19:12.130 --> 19:13.080
Hey,

19:13.080 --> 19:14.810
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:16.270 --> 19:18.070
Are you all here for Science Club?

19:18.070 --> 19:20.030
Yeah, science rocks!

19:20.410 --> 19:24.680
Welcome! Welcome! Oh what a happy day,
I've touched you kids.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.620
I'm going to save the space programme.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.460
Wait one nanosecond.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.330
Science Club was supposed to be exclusively for geeks.

19:31.330 --> 19:33.160
It is, but now we're all geeks.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.120
Right now the Science Club is for everyone.

19:36.120 --> 19:37.410
Are you kidding?

19:37.410 --> 19:38.970
This isn't a club,

19:39.430 --> 19:42.870
it's just a bunch of people with shared
interests hanging out together.

19:44.660 --> 19:49.150
Well not me. I'm going
home to wash my hair.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.120
Wait, don't leave, you'll miss out.

19:52.340 --> 19:55.230
The rest of us are going to play
with really strong magnets.

20:01.870 --> 20:06.350
Look at you. Geeked
to the gills, this is awful.

20:06.690 --> 20:09.750
I blame myself, no wait, I blame Zelda.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.110
This is all your fault.

20:12.110 --> 20:15.950
My fault? Oh Sabrina you look
adorable and so smart.

20:15.950 --> 20:18.770
I feel smart and you know what?
I learned something.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.850
No matter what we're labelled Libby will
always be Libby and I will always be me.

20:23.210 --> 20:25.140
You had to become a geek to figure that out?

20:25.280 --> 20:29.170
Well it's actually rather complex.
I just put it in layman's terms for you.

20:29.610 --> 20:31.550
I have to do that all the time.

20:31.550 --> 20:34.190
Oh, so what are you saying,
you dumb things down for me?

20:34.190 --> 20:37.000
Well, C colon backslash D'ah!

20:37.110 --> 20:38.870
- Would you speak English.
- You are always ..

20:38.870 --> 20:39.990
- Oh if you're so smart..
- ...pulling science down..

20:39.990 --> 20:41.560
- ... I have knowledge you don't too..
- .... Without knowledge we'd..

20:42.650 --> 20:44.290
I'm going to take a shower.

20:51.140 --> 20:52.470
Here let me help.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.710
Wait a minute.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.370
Here you go, Gordie.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.010
You're setting me up aren't you?

20:59.950 --> 21:01.490
so now we're helping geeks? 

21:01.490 --> 21:03.620
Well I just don't feel like
making fun of them anymore.

21:03.620 --> 21:05.180
You know geeks are people too.

21:05.530 --> 21:09.030
But if we can't make fun of geeks,
who will we make fun of?

21:10.600 --> 21:13.260
Hi Sabrina, Superfreak!

21:24.610 --> 21:28.470
I just thought you should know the kid
next door is chucking water balloons at our house.

21:28.610 --> 21:30.660
Mm, I know. Hilda already went out there,

21:30.660 --> 21:32.580
she said she was going to
do something about it.

21:32.590 --> 21:34.780
He's such a little creep,
he's going to break my window.

21:35.230 --> 21:37.760
Arr! prepare to be boarded, Timmy!

21:39.350 --> 21:40.810
What was that?

21:42.760 --> 21:45.820
Yes! I used my cannon, it stays.

21:45.821 --> 21:49.774
