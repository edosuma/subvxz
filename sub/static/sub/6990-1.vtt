07:13.766 --> 07:15.642
Whoa!

07:18.718 --> 07:25.783
Good day. I am here with
permission... I have a, a..

07:26.070 --> 07:29.406
A permit? Ah... Damn! How do you say "permit"?
I have a permit.

07:29.574 --> 07:33.410
- Dr. Niko Tapopopolis?
- It's Tatopoulos.

07:33.578 --> 07:37.747
Kyle Terrington.
I'm with the U.S. State Department.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.461
- What are they doing?
- You're being reassigned.

07:42.628 --> 07:46.339
- But my work here isn't finished.
- It is now.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.745
There's pressure
from the Americans.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.288
What have you told them?

08:18.581 --> 08:19.831
Nothing yet.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.083
Are there any survivors?

08:22.251 --> 08:25.962
Only one, sir. He was lucky.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.597
Get them out.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.783
Ask him what happened.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.049
What did you see, old man?

09:12.949 --> 09:19.349
Gojira! Gojira... Gojira!

09:37.159 --> 09:39.744
That's affirmative.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.498
Hey, where are you going
with my stuff?

09:44.292 --> 09:49.921
Hello. Hello.
That's very delicate.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.840
Thank you.

09:52.008 --> 09:55.343
- Dr. Niko Topodopeless?
- It's Tatopoulos.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.805
Whatever. Come on,
get these people off of the pier!

09:58.973 --> 10:03.435
- Excuse me. Sir, do you mind telling me what am I doing in here?
- Watch your step. Don't talk to anybody.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.896
Come on, get them off the damn pier!

10:08.983 --> 10:12.193
- What is all this, some kind of spill?
- Something like that.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.322
Look, I work for the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission...

10:15.489 --> 10:17.699
...but accidents
and spills aren't my field.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.534
We know.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.996
You know you've interrupted a 3-year
study of the Chernobyl earthworm?

10:23.164 --> 10:25.040
Yeah, you're the worm guy, right?

10:25.207 --> 10:30.545
The radioactive contamination in that
area has mutated the earthworm's DNA.

10:30.713 --> 10:34.007
- You know what that means?
- I got a feeling I'm about to find out.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.468
It means, because of a
man-made accident...

10:36.636 --> 10:40.597
...the Chernobyl earthworms are now
17% larger than they were before.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.559
- Seventeen percent? Sounds pretty big.
- They're enormous.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.103
That's what I'm saying.
I'm a biologist.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.898
I take radioactive samples
and I study them.

10:50.066 --> 10:54.069
- Great. Here's your sample. Study it.
- What sample?

10:55.488 --> 10:59.324
- You're standing in it.
- I don't see it.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.037
Where is it?

11:04.872 --> 11:06.998
I don't see it.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.594
Colonel! Colonel!

11:19.762 --> 11:24.099
That was a footprint!
I was standing inside of a footprint!

11:24.266 --> 11:26.393
That's right.

11:26.560 --> 11:31.940
But there's no animal in the world that
makes footprints like that, is there?

11:32.108 --> 11:36.194
I told them this is not your field,
but they never listen to genius.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.447
This is Elsie Chapman, of the
National Institute of Palaeontology.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.865
She's your boss.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.410
- Those were footprints, right?
- Yes, they were.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.203
Did anybody see what made them?

11:45.371 --> 11:49.499
Actually, no such luck.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.378
It happened so fast, nobody knew
what hit them until it was over.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.922
- Elsie.
- Yeah?

11:56.090 --> 12:00.135
The tape's in.
The French finally released it.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.179
This is a Japanese cannery ship...

12:03.347 --> 12:05.807
...that was attacked and sunk
near French Polynesia.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.894
We believe it's connected. Dr. Craven,
have you met the worm guy?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.898
Sorry. Summer cold.

12:50.686 --> 12:54.647
- Come on, all right?
- Have a nice day.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.571
Wait, wait, wait!

13:06.869 --> 13:10.038
- They say it'll rain all week.
- What's with the bags?

13:10.206 --> 13:14.959
- Caiman's groceries.
- Oh, girl.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.838
- Speak of the devil.
- What?

13:19.381 --> 13:22.550
This is the midget version.
This makes me look like a professional.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.719
Can we put this on the 5, please?

13:24.887 --> 13:26.888
- You think I should ask him?
- No.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.140
- I'm gonna ask him.
- No!

13:29.308 --> 13:32.519
- I will.
- Audrey.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.690
- Did you talk with Humphries?
- This is not the place.

13:37.858 --> 13:41.361
- Just tell me. Did you talk with him?
- It's between you and Rodriguez.

13:41.529 --> 13:45.448
You serious? He's gonna consider me
for the job? What else did he say?

13:46.408 --> 13:50.328
Why don't we talk about it
over dinner tonight? Your place.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.915
- Mr. Caiman, you're married.
- Yes, and you're very beautiful.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.418
- Have I ever told you that before?
- Mr. Caiman!

13:58.254 --> 13:59.921
I've been doing research for you...

14:00.089 --> 14:02.340
...after hours and weekends
for over three years.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.593
This is a very important job to me.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.595
I'm too old to be
your assistant anymore.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.848
I need to know this job
is going someplace.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.851
So have dinner with me tonight.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.353
I can't.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.106
It's your choice.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.441
- Okay, let's go.
- Charlie.

14:20.609 --> 14:23.027
Say hello to your new co-anchor,
Ms. Desireé Pon.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.446
Hello, Desireé, welcome aboard.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.202
Mark, can I have a pillow,
phone book, something?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.246
- Three, two...

14:33.455 --> 14:38.710
Hello, New York. Today at 5 we'll
ask Fat Pat when the rain will end.

14:42.965 --> 14:47.302
So three years digging up worms
in Chernobyl?

14:47.469 --> 14:53.141
- How did Mrs. Tatapolis handle it?
- Tatopoulos. I'm actually not married.

14:53.309 --> 14:59.731
- Really? A girlfriend, or...?
- No. Perhaps I work too much.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.317
So do you mean to tell me
there's no one...

15:02.484 --> 15:05.194
...who holds a special place
in your heart?

15:06.989 --> 15:10.491
No. Not for a long time now.

15:10.701 --> 15:15.330
Well, you may be the wrong man
for the job, but I think you're cute.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.335
Thank you.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.174
She thinks I'm cute.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.439
Who the hell are they?

16:25.067 --> 16:28.236
- Get those people out of there.
- They're with me.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.572
Is that right? Who are you?

16:31.740 --> 16:34.242
La Rochelle Casualty
and Property Insurance.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.119
We're preparing our report.

16:36.286 --> 16:39.080
- You're pretty damn fast.
- That's our job.

16:39.289 --> 16:42.250
Your people are getting
in the way of my job.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.336
Colonel, what do you think
could have done this?

16:46.755 --> 16:51.926
Listen, Mr. Roach, you get your
people out of here, or I will.

17:32.134 --> 17:36.846
The captain's getting some coffee.
Then he's gonna kick your asses.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.765
Well, I'm in for a buck.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.405
What the hell
is that dope-head doing?

17:59.161 --> 18:04.332
Artie, what the hell's wrong?
Why are we slowing down?

18:04.500 --> 18:09.504
I don't know, she's at full throttle.
Maybe she's heavy in the net.

18:22.684 --> 18:27.021
- How come we stopped? Nets full?
- I don't think so.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.524
We must be caught on something.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.944
Bring in the nets. Bring them up!
Pull them in now.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.447
- What's going on?
- We're bringing them in.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.699
The engines are heating up.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.953
- Should I shut them down?
- No, keep pulling.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.917
I'm trying! I'm trying!

18:50.712 --> 18:53.214
Cut them loose!

18:59.972 --> 19:01.180
Look out!

19:08.564 --> 19:09.897
Cut them loose now!

19:11.233 --> 19:12.775
Hurry! Hurry!

19:17.447 --> 19:19.740
She's going down!

19:59.198 --> 20:00.698
Do you hear that?

20:29.144 --> 20:32.897
Excuse me, sir. We just got a report
of three fishing trawlers going down.

20:34.483 --> 20:38.069
- What makes you think it's related?
- The trawlers were pulled under, sir.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.533
Jesus Christ...

20:45.035 --> 20:47.161
It's only 200 miles off
the Eastern seaboard...

20:47.329 --> 20:49.080
...and we don't even know what it is.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.748
- Theropoda allosaurus.
- What?

20:50.916 --> 20:52.250
A type of enormous reptile...

20:52.417 --> 20:54.919
...that we believed
died out in the Cretaceous Period.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.630
So where's it been hiding
the last 60 million years?

20:57.798 --> 21:00.216
What about the traces of radiation?

21:01.260 --> 21:05.513
The radiation isn't an anomaly.
It's the clue.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.975
This animal is much too big
to be some kind of lost dinosaur.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.686
Don't tell me what it isn't,
tell me what it is.

21:11.853 --> 21:14.355
Well, what do we know?

21:15.565 --> 21:21.028
It was first sighted off of
the French Polynesian Pacific.

21:21.196 --> 21:25.032
That area has been exposed
to dozens of nuclear tests.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.369
- Hence the radiation.
- More than that.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.872
I believe it's a mutated aberration.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.959
A hybrid caused by the fallout
on these islands.

21:35.377 --> 21:36.961
Like your earthworms?

21:38.005 --> 21:39.463
Yes. Yes.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.634
We're looking at a completely
incipient creature.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.512
The dawn of a new species.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.223
The first of its kind.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.076
- My life sucks.
- Oh, please.

22:09.244 --> 22:13.497
- Your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
- Because I'm married to you.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.583
I cannot believe
he put the moves on me.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.460
After everything I've done for him.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.420
He is scum.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.757
To him, you're just
a pair of breasts that talk.

22:22.924 --> 22:26.761
- Hey, there's an image.
- I'm telling you, he is dirt.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.805
He's a douche-bag, gutter-slime'
dog-crap puke-chunks.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.766
Hey, you don't see I'm eating?

22:32.476 --> 22:35.478
Audrey, you're too damn nice.

22:35.645 --> 22:39.940
That's your problem.
Nice gets you nothing in this town.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.778
It's dog-eat-dog.
You gotta be a killer to get ahead.

22:43.945 --> 22:47.948
I'm sorry, baby, but you just
don't got what it takes.

22:48.950 --> 22:53.287
- Do you think that's true?
- Pretty much. You're a nice person.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.374
Nice guys finish last.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.795
- I can be tough if I want.
- Yeah, sure.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.298
I can. I can.

23:04.466 --> 23:08.010
- No, yeah, no.
- Whatever.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.805
Oh, my God!

23:11.807 --> 23:15.142
Oh, my God!
Could you turn that up please?

23:17.145 --> 23:20.481
- Sometime in the last 12 hours.
It is not known yet...

23:20.649 --> 23:23.651
- It's Nick.
- Who is he?

23:23.819 --> 23:27.988
He was my college sweetie.
He looks so handsome on TV.

23:28.156 --> 23:31.575
There is tight security
around the crash site...

23:31.743 --> 23:36.831
...possibly due to the sensitive
military cargo on the plane.

23:47.509 --> 23:51.178
You wanna unload this thing?
I'm getting soaked here.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.222
Come on, will you?

23:59.229 --> 24:02.273
Hey, Joe! Gonna catch one of them
little fish in the East River?

24:02.441 --> 24:04.275
I hope so.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.610
But you never know.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.905
I mean, today could be my lucky day.

24:10.073 --> 24:12.366
The only thing you'll catch is a cold.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.589
Hey.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.260
I got a bite.

24:33.388 --> 24:36.640
Boy, do I have a bite!

24:40.061 --> 24:43.522
Don't let up on him, Joe.
You got a big one, baby. Hold on to it.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.900
You want to fight?

26:25.667 --> 26:28.919
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen,
the man you've all been waiting for.

26:29.087 --> 26:33.090
Yours for a safer New York,
your mayor, Mayor Ebert!

26:34.676 --> 26:37.469
Thank you. Thank you.

26:37.637 --> 26:42.558
I want to thank you all for coming out
on this beautiful New York City day.

26:43.935 --> 26:48.522
Four years ago, people didn't think
I would reduce crime.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.233
But I did!

27:10.712 --> 27:12.046
Oh, my God.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.899
Move! Let's get out of here!

27:42.952 --> 27:44.703
I'm grateful we're getting a new set.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.414
I know that represents a
commitment from management.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.375
Here's what I don't understand:

27:49.542 --> 27:51.460
Why we're the only station in town...

27:51.628 --> 27:54.588
...that doesn't have the Korean
grocery holdup as our lead.

27:54.756 --> 27:57.633
- What's our lead? Rain, again!
- Mom?

27:57.801 --> 28:01.428
I know, it impresses the people at the
parties you go to that we're classy.

28:01.596 --> 28:04.348
Sorry, I just don't give
a rat's ass about a war...

28:04.516 --> 28:07.518
...in some country whose name
I can't even pronounce.

28:08.603 --> 28:12.022
- How about a real story?
- Sir?

28:12.190 --> 28:15.776
I think your story
just walked by the window.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.823
What?

28:22.117 --> 28:25.035
Maybe we can get in the Korean
grocer's hospital room.

28:25.203 --> 28:29.289
- So did this Romeo have a name?
- Nick Tatopoulos.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.710
- Jesus. Is that why you dumped him?
- No.

28:32.877 --> 28:37.464
- How long did you go out for anyway?
- Nearly four years.

28:37.632 --> 28:40.467
Girl, I'm surprised he didn't
ask you to marry him.

28:40.635 --> 28:43.137
Well, that's the problem.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.805
He did.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.184
Tell me that's not another parade.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.479
I don't think that's a parade.

28:55.608 --> 28:57.276
Please stand by.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.695
What the hell is that?

29:11.166 --> 29:14.168
Are you all right? Are you cut?
You all right?

29:16.838 --> 29:19.673
Victor! Don't be stupid.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.844
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
That is really...

29:24.012 --> 29:27.681
That is large.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.267
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

29:34.773 --> 29:36.940
Come on, you bastard. Come on!

29:38.276 --> 29:41.570
Victor, get back here, you retard!

29:50.246 --> 29:52.372
Somebody do something!

29:59.714 --> 30:01.757
Come on! Come on!

31:01.651 --> 31:03.527
Can you tell us what's going on?

31:03.695 --> 31:05.112
Watch it!

31:18.042 --> 31:21.295
- Sergeant O'Neal, sir.
- Any word from the mayor's office?

31:21.462 --> 31:25.299
Yes, sir. They've agreed to evacuate the
city. They've called the National Guard.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.885
Evacuate Manhattan?
That's over 3 million people.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.554
- Has that ever been done before?
- I don't think so.

31:30.722 --> 31:34.558
- Where is he now?
- We lost sight of it, sir.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.977
You wanna run that by me again?

31:38.479 --> 31:41.481
After its initial attack, he...

31:42.567 --> 31:44.151
...disappeared.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.987
Secretary of Defense Burk
is on the line.

31:48.823 --> 31:51.658
I don't understand. How can
something so big just disappear?

31:51.826 --> 31:53.493
- We're not sure, but...
- Yeah, yeah.

31:53.661 --> 31:57.164
- He probably returned to the river.
- I don't think so.

31:57.332 --> 32:03.462
I mean, look at it. It's perfect.
An island, water on all sides.

32:05.340 --> 32:10.761
But like no other island in the world'
it's a place where he can easily hide.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.096
He's in there someplace.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.932
Channel 12 caught it on tape.

32:15.391 --> 32:19.853
Hello, I'm Charles Caiman,
in the WIDF news center.

32:20.021 --> 32:23.523
Ladies and gentlemen, we New Υorkers
like to think we've seen it all...

32:23.733 --> 32:27.861
...but what you're going to see now
will shock you beyond belief.

32:28.029 --> 32:31.198
This is footage we have
that indicates...

32:31.366 --> 32:34.534
...that there is a dinosaur
loose in Manhattan.

32:34.702 --> 32:38.956
WIDF's exclusive footage was shot
barely half an hour ago.

32:39.123 --> 32:44.127
WIDF cameraman, Victor "Animal"
Palotti, surνived unharmed.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.048
You are so great.

32:48.257 --> 32:50.467
Great stuff, Animal.
Weren't you scared?

32:50.635 --> 32:52.844
Yeah, I thought Lucy
was gonna kill me.

32:53.012 --> 32:55.764
- Damn right, you crazy wop.
- Okay, people.

32:55.932 --> 32:58.976
- What were you thinking?
- We have to be completely relocated...

32:59.143 --> 33:02.896
...to the New Jersey station
for the 10:00 broadcast. Animal!

33:03.064 --> 33:06.817
You're riding in the chopper
with Caiman. Now. Let's go, lift off.

33:06.985 --> 33:11.405
- Are you going to be all right?
- Yeah. Audrey's gonna spend the night.

33:11.572 --> 33:15.575
A threesome. That's excellent.
I'm a little tired, but...

33:15.785 --> 33:18.996
Dozens of people are reported killed,
thousands injured.

33:19.163 --> 33:22.124
Civil defense stations are
being set up throughout Manhattan.

33:22.291 --> 33:25.085
But in addition, city, military
and health officials...

33:25.253 --> 33:27.796
...are setting up a command post
on the Jersey shore...

33:27.964 --> 33:29.840
...in anticipation of an evacuation...

33:30.008 --> 33:33.093
- My bag. My bag!
- Mr. Caiman.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.095
Mr. Caiman, wait.

33:35.638 --> 33:37.931
Mr. Caiman, I've got a lead.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.434
I know a guy who's
on the inside with the military.

33:40.601 --> 33:43.437
- Not now.
- I can get great inside information.

33:43.604 --> 33:46.440
Look. This is the moment When
the big boys go to Work, okay?

33:46.607 --> 33:48.150
The bag.

34:00.246 --> 34:03.832
- This is crazy. Come on, let's go.
- Wait up.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.126
Come on.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.295
Wait up.

34:10.465 --> 34:14.426
- Can we get a cab?
- Audrey, what are you thinking?

34:14.594 --> 34:18.138
Move, move!
On the sidewalk, right now!

34:29.025 --> 34:30.984
In what city officials
are describing as...

34:31.152 --> 34:34.321
...the worst act of destruction since
the World Trade Center bombing...

34:34.489 --> 34:37.364
...hundreds of thousands
have jammed the streets...

34:37.533 --> 34:40.494
...in the largest evacuation
in this city's history.

34:40.661 --> 34:41.995
And many people...

34:42.163 --> 34:45.123
Many, many people
are not happy about it.

34:45.291 --> 34:48.668
Among those unhappy citizens
are the managers of the stores...

34:48.835 --> 34:50.837
...along pricey 5th and Madison Ave.

34:51.005 --> 34:54.674
The Warner Bros. And Disney stores
have been cleared out by looters.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.552
The streets are jammed.
Traffic's at a standstill.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.181
Emergency vehicles cannot have access
to emergencies that may develop.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.518
There's a slow but steady stream
out of the city...

35:04.685 --> 35:09.106
...as if Long Island or New Jersey
were any refuge in this time of crisis.

35:09.273 --> 35:12.025
This is great. If I'm wrong
on this evacuation...

35:12.193 --> 35:14.653
...they'll string me up
from the Liberty torch.

35:14.821 --> 35:18.865
Didn't we agreed we weren't gonna have
any sw eets until after the election?

35:19.742 --> 35:21.827
Back off, Gene.

35:36.884 --> 35:38.260
Who the hell are they?

35:38.427 --> 35:41.471
A contingent of building oWners
and business representatives.

35:41.639 --> 35:45.225
- I don't have time for this nonsense.
- Campaign contributors.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.894
Ladies and gentlemen,
I share your concerns.

35:48.062 --> 35:52.566
I want to get this city back in business
as soon as possible. Please.

35:54.193 --> 35:59.239
La Rochelle Insurance. We represent
nearly 13% of the buildings in your city.

35:59.448 --> 36:02.242
You can count on our emotional
and financial support.

36:02.410 --> 36:03.910
Well, thank you. Thank you.

36:04.078 --> 36:05.662
What do you plan to do?

36:18.259 --> 36:19.801
- Coming through.
- Where's your ID?

36:19.969 --> 36:22.637
- What's wrong? Don't you watch TV?
- You gotta have press ID.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.765
I've got ID. I had a badge on my bag.

36:26.809 --> 36:28.768
I don't know if this is a good idea.

36:28.936 --> 36:31.229
What are you talking about?
You stole it.

36:31.397 --> 36:34.274
Finally you got a little chutzpah.
Don't wimp out.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.610
- What if Caiman finds out?
- Look.

36:36.777 --> 36:40.447
How often do you think you'll have
an ex-boyfriend inside a major story?

36:40.615 --> 36:43.491
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.161
If you stick this thing...

36:47.163 --> 36:49.206
Have you got any glue or something?

36:49.749 --> 36:53.376
I'm sorry, I left my forgery kit
back at the office.

37:24.992 --> 37:27.661
- No croissant?
- No, monsieur.

37:32.667 --> 37:36.544
- You call this coffee?
- No, I call this America.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.800
Sorry, Mr. Mayor, that's where
we are at this point.

37:41.968 --> 37:43.510
Now, hold on. Hold on.

37:43.678 --> 37:48.265
You're telling me, in an election month
I evacuated this city for nothing?

37:48.432 --> 37:52.185
Do you realize what this evacuation
will cost the people of this city?

37:52.353 --> 37:54.854
We've been monitoring
all the waters around the island.

37:55.022 --> 37:57.607
As far as we can tell'
this thing has not left the area.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.735
- But you don't know for sure.
- We have reason to believe...

38:00.903 --> 38:03.863
...it may be hiding in
a building in the restricted area.

38:04.073 --> 38:06.199
- But you don't know for sure!
- Mr. Mayor.

38:07.201 --> 38:11.371
We cannot give the all-clear until each
and every building has been checked.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.540
- What is it?
- Excuse me, sir.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.750
That may be more difficult
than we projected.

38:15.918 --> 38:19.546
Terrific. Terrific! More good news!

38:20.965 --> 38:23.550
We've run into a problem.

38:23.718 --> 38:26.094
- Do you believe this?
- I don't know what's going on.

38:26.262 --> 38:28.221
- You never know what's going on.
- Thank you.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.983
- Right here, sir.
- Have them fall in.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.902
Let's go, people, fall in downstairs.

39:07.136 --> 39:10.305
Lieutenant Anderson and his men
found this, this afternoon.

39:15.144 --> 39:18.772
We were checking the building above
and we discovered the floor was gone.

39:18.939 --> 39:22.359
When we discovered that he could
burrow his way through the tunnels...

39:23.652 --> 39:26.404
...we realized he could be
outside the quarantine zone.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.114
Holy Christ.

39:28.908 --> 39:33.119
- How many tunnels lead off the island?
- Only 14. He hasn't used any of them.

39:33.287 --> 39:36.164
- Have them all sealed up.
- Yes, sir.

39:37.792 --> 39:40.627
How? How would we do that, sir?

39:40.795 --> 39:46.049
Fill them with cement, brick them up,
put landmines in them. I don't care!

39:46.217 --> 39:48.885
Make sure the damn thing
doesn't leave the island.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.895
You know, he's not some enemy
trying to evade you.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.563
He's just an animal.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.524
What are you suggesting?

40:02.691 --> 40:04.943
Well, when I had to
catch earthworms...

40:05.152 --> 40:07.987
...I knew the best way to get them
was not to dig them out...

40:08.155 --> 40:09.614
...but to draw them out.

40:09.782 --> 40:15.620
All we need to do is to find out
what he needs, and he'll come to you.

40:35.015 --> 40:38.435
- Where are they now?
- Delta Niner, where is the convoy?

40:38.602 --> 40:40.687
Command, they've just
entered the city.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.994
I have no contact with the convoy.
I'm expecting ground confirmation.

40:56.162 --> 41:00.206
- Sir, convoy ETA is 10 minutes.
- We've got to hurry.

41:00.374 --> 41:04.711
Man your positions. Ten minutes ETΑ.
Go, go, go! All systems go.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.974
Is it good?

41:19.226 --> 41:21.895
Let's go, let's go!
Come on, move it through!

41:27.818 --> 41:30.195
We have picture.
You can leave, Jean Luc.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.405
We have a signal, sir.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.246
You said this was French Roast!

41:45.961 --> 41:48.129
More cream.

42:03.395 --> 42:06.105
Bring them in. Come on,
bring it back!

42:08.901 --> 42:13.071
- I sure hope this plan of yours works.
- I'm kind of hoping that myself.

42:14.448 --> 42:16.866
- Did you approve this?
- They just appropriated it.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.910
Twelve of the city's dump trucks.

42:19.078 --> 42:21.204
Would you like to tell me
what's going on here?

42:21.372 --> 42:24.791
Actually, no, I wouldn't.
And don't touch anything.

42:24.959 --> 42:28.002
- How's O'Neal doing?
- Everything is on schedule, sir.

42:28.170 --> 42:31.881
- Sure you didn't know about this?
- No one told me anything about this.

42:32.049 --> 42:34.008
Why do I even keep you around?

42:39.890 --> 42:42.183
Dump!

42:50.985 --> 42:54.028
No. Very clever.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.993
All right, let's pile it on,
and let's get out of here.

43:04.206 --> 43:05.832
That's a lot of fish.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.820
Come on, you bastard,
it's suppertime.

43:38.073 --> 43:41.492
Look at all that frigging fish.
Is this gonna work?

44:00.512 --> 44:04.932
We gotta get the manholes uncovered.
We want him to smell the bait.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.726
Come on.

44:07.853 --> 44:10.104
Let's go! Let's go!

44:15.027 --> 44:16.569
Come on, guys.

44:19.907 --> 44:23.951
- Let's get those lids off. Go, go!
- What the hell is he doing?

44:24.119 --> 44:27.705
- Okay, this way, this way. Come on.
- Let's go!

44:27.873 --> 44:29.749
Come on. Over there!

44:31.377 --> 44:33.086
- This one.
- Yes, sir.

44:38.300 --> 44:40.468
- Give me the crowbar.
- Sir.

46:29.244 --> 46:32.413
Set up here. I've got a shot.

47:00.567 --> 47:02.193
This is Six Alpha Charlie.

47:02.361 --> 47:05.530
We gotta move.
We can't stay put, we gotta move!

48:02.296 --> 48:03.921
Let's go, fall back!

48:10.137 --> 48:11.971
Go, go, go!

48:17.019 --> 48:19.645
We need bigger guns.

48:21.023 --> 48:23.983
- We've lost communications.
- Get us back online. Fire at will!

48:24.151 --> 48:25.610
Sergeant, fire at will!

48:25.819 --> 48:27.778
Fire! Fire! Fire!

49:17.454 --> 49:19.664
O'Neal, you better tell me
what's going on.

49:19.831 --> 49:23.542
He's gone, sir, he's gone.
Echo unit in pursuit.

49:36.598 --> 49:37.723
Follow my lead.

49:51.196 --> 49:53.823
All systems armed. Echo 4 armed.

50:00.122 --> 50:02.623
We're doing 80 knots
and he's pulling away, sir.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.126
I've got him locked on.

50:05.335 --> 50:08.546
- Locked on, sir. Target is locked on.
- Fire the damn missile.

50:08.714 --> 50:11.716
- Echo 1 through 4, fire at will.
- Fire sidewinders.

50:38.910 --> 50:44.290
Damn! That is a negative impact.
I repeat, that is a negative impact.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.834
- Negative impact, sir.
- "Negative impact"?

50:47.002 --> 50:49.462
That's the damn
Chrysler Building we're talking about.

50:49.629 --> 50:53.007
- You told me he had it locked on.
- Echo 1, we had you locked on.

50:53.175 --> 50:56.510
The heat-seekers can't lock. He's
colder than the buildings around him.

50:59.139 --> 51:02.975
Freddie. Freddie! Freddie!

51:03.143 --> 51:06.020
- What? What?
- Let's go before we get caught.

51:06.188 --> 51:08.105
Jimmy. You know
that bad feeling I get...

51:08.273 --> 51:10.316
...when something really bad
is gonna happen?

51:10.525 --> 51:12.485
I'm getting that feeling
right now, man.

51:20.327 --> 51:25.164
- Descend to 300 feet. Lasers on.
- Target, 11 o'clock.

51:54.653 --> 51:55.861
Where'd he go?

52:04.538 --> 52:07.331
Echo flight, get it together, guys.
Prepare to fire.

52:07.499 --> 52:10.751
- Echo 4, ready.
- Echo 2, ready.

52:10.961 --> 52:13.045
Fire!

52:31.648 --> 52:32.982
I think we got him.

52:45.912 --> 52:47.788
We've lost Echo 1 and 2, sir.

52:48.540 --> 52:50.583
Echo 4, where is target?

52:54.546 --> 52:57.590
Jesus! He's right on my tail, sir.

53:01.011 --> 53:03.262
I don't think I can shake him.

53:14.441 --> 53:15.941
I think I lost him.

53:21.781 --> 53:25.159
We've... We've lost Echo 4, sir.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.996
What's the matter with you people?

53:29.206 --> 53:32.208
You've caused more damage
than that goddamn thing did!

53:32.417 --> 53:35.920
- Calm down. Have some candy.
- I don't want any. Leave me alone!

54:01.196 --> 54:03.781
I can't believe it. I mean...

54:04.950 --> 54:09.536
He did all of this,
and we did nothing to him.

54:09.704 --> 54:13.457
That's not true. We fed him.

54:17.671 --> 54:19.713
Here at the command center
in New Jersey...

54:19.881 --> 54:21.882
...there is no new information
to report.

54:22.092 --> 54:27.388
The military has clamped a media
blackout on whatever is going on.

54:27.597 --> 54:29.348
Officials are not saying anything...

54:29.516 --> 54:33.978
...about their attempts to contain or
control this creature, and now I see...

54:34.396 --> 54:37.273
No, the situation is under control.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.859
It's under control,
we have containment.

54:56.626 --> 54:58.877
- Can I help you, young man?
- Yes.

54:59.379 --> 55:01.588
Do you have any
at-home pregnancy tests?

55:01.756 --> 55:04.675
Especially ones that look for
gonadotropic hormones...

55:04.843 --> 55:06.927
...or clomiphene citrate?

55:07.137 --> 55:08.721
I don't know. This...

55:09.180 --> 55:10.597
This...

55:11.433 --> 55:14.435
- This is all we've got.
- I'll take all of them.

55:15.061 --> 55:17.855
Wow, you must have
quite some harem.

55:20.150 --> 55:25.070
Audrey? Oh, my Go... Is that you?
What are you doing here?

55:25.238 --> 55:27.156
Hi. Hello.

55:27.532 --> 55:30.075
- Wow. How much is that?
- $46.

55:30.243 --> 55:34.371
God, you look...
Wow! How have you been?

55:34.748 --> 55:36.665
It's good to see you, Nick.

55:38.877 --> 55:41.128
- So you made it.
- What?

55:41.296 --> 55:43.589
You're a reporter, huh?

55:44.132 --> 55:47.092
No, that's good. That's good.
That's what you always wanted.

55:47.385 --> 55:51.221
I'm happy for you. Really, I am.

56:03.943 --> 56:06.028
You're still mad at me?

56:06.237 --> 56:10.866
Well, you left without a phone call,
a letter, nothing. All this time.

56:11.034 --> 56:14.787
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
I am still a little mad.

56:16.122 --> 56:19.958
That was eight years ago.
Some people change.

56:20.126 --> 56:22.294
Most people don't.

56:25.131 --> 56:28.133
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.430
Audrey.

56:37.018 --> 56:41.021
You're right.
Eight years is a long time.

56:41.231 --> 56:43.065
Can I make you a cup of tea?

56:45.819 --> 56:49.154
Sure, that'd be nice.

56:49.322 --> 56:51.198
I still can't believe it.

56:51.366 --> 56:53.617
How does a guy go
from anti-nuke activist...

56:53.785 --> 56:56.829
...to working for the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission?

56:57.997 --> 57:01.583
When you and I went
to rallies together in college...

57:01.835 --> 57:04.128
...we helped to create awareness.

57:04.295 --> 57:09.174
But now, from the inside,
I'm able to effect real change.

57:09.342 --> 57:12.469
Exactly what changes
are you trying to effect?

57:12.637 --> 57:15.222
I'm preparing a census
for the government.

57:15.390 --> 57:18.308
I'm cataloging new species
that have been created...

57:18.476 --> 57:20.561
...as a direct result
of nuclear contamination.

57:20.937 --> 57:23.355
Is that what you think
created this thing?

57:23.523 --> 57:26.650
Yeah. I found a blood sample
earlier this evening.

57:26.818 --> 57:30.863
- How close did you get to the thing?
- I got pretty close.

57:33.074 --> 57:38.036
- And what else did you find out?
- Well, we know he eats tons of fish.

57:38.204 --> 57:42.875
He's amphibious.
He's a burrower. And...

57:48.923 --> 57:51.049
...he's pregnant.

57:53.720 --> 57:57.890
- He is?
- He's a very unusual he.

57:58.850 --> 58:02.269
I mean, obviously these tests
weren't designed for this...

58:02.437 --> 58:05.522
...but fundamentally they look for
the same hormonal patterns...

58:05.690 --> 58:06.899
...to indicate pregnancy.

58:07.066 --> 58:11.236
I don't get it. If he's the first of his
kind, how can he be pregnant?

58:11.404 --> 58:12.779
Doesn't he need a mate?

58:12.947 --> 58:14.948
Not if he reproduces asexually.

58:16.117 --> 58:17.910
Where's the fun in that?

58:20.121 --> 58:24.124
I kept thinking'
why would he travel so far?

58:24.334 --> 58:26.084
But it makes perfect sense.

58:26.294 --> 58:30.714
Lots of animals travel
great distances for reproduction.

58:31.925 --> 58:35.135
That's what he's doing in New York.
He's nesting.

58:35.303 --> 58:37.429
- Nesting?
- Yes.

58:38.014 --> 58:42.601
Do you realize that a lizard can lay
up to 12 eggs at a time?

58:42.769 --> 58:45.729
- Think of it.
- I didn't know that.

58:45.897 --> 58:50.943
Forgive me, I have to get this to the
lab and see if I can confirm all this.

58:52.153 --> 58:54.613
I'll be right back.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:01:01.198
Come on, Joey'
there's nothing down here.

01:01:01.366 --> 01:01:03.367
I'm telling you, man, I heard...

01:01:03.534 --> 01:01:05.077
I heard something.

01:01:05.244 --> 01:01:08.038
You heard nothing. It's a dead end.

01:01:17.715 --> 01:01:19.132
Anything?

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:24.137
No. Nothing down here.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.640
Nothing at all.

01:01:35.983 --> 01:01:39.444
This is why, in this case, all the king's
horses and all the king's men...

01:01:39.612 --> 01:01:42.155
...may not be able to put
the Big Apple together again.

01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:43.907
Audrey Timmonds, WIDF News.

01:01:44.075 --> 01:01:45.117
Yes!

01:01:45.284 --> 01:01:46.785
- You owe me a beer.
- Like it?

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:48.745
- Yeah.
- I should've worn my hair back.

01:01:48.913 --> 01:01:50.539
- No, it looks great.
- Good, good.

01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:54.292
How did you get ahold of this?

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:59.297
Well, you know. It's like you said,
nice guys finish last.

01:01:59.465 --> 01:02:01.967
- Thank you. I love you.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.427
What...?

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:13.645
Murray. Murray! Come here a second.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.857
Hold on a second, all right?
What is it?

01:02:17.024 --> 01:02:20.110
I've got exclusive footage of other
places this thing has attacked.

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:21.528
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:24.322
- Whose story is that?
- Mine.

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:38.003
There's a lot of movement
down there.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.756
Military, police...

01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:45.927
- It's my breakfast.
- I'm hungry.

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:47.262
Quiet!

01:02:47.472 --> 01:02:49.681
If we can lure him into
a more open area...

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:53.727
...such as this portion of Central Park,
we should be able to take him down.

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.646
- Last time you didn't even scratch it.
- That's not true.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.648
My worm guy, I mean...

01:02:58.816 --> 01:03:02.652
...Dr. Tatopoulos has found blood.
- Yes, I did.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.114
See, the only thing we need to do
is get him out into open terrain...

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:09.284
...and use weapons that don't rely
on heat-seeking technology...

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:14.998
Excuse me, sir. I think the situation has
become more complicated than that.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:20.212
The blood I collected revealed that the
creature is either about to lay eggs...

01:03:20.379 --> 01:03:22.339
...or already has.

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:26.218
Are you trying to tell us that there's
another of those things out there?

01:03:26.385 --> 01:03:28.845
No, no, governor, I don't believe so.

01:03:29.013 --> 01:03:32.557
Wait a minute, wait.
Then how can it be pregnant?

01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:35.018
What is this, the Virgin Lizard?

01:03:35.686 --> 01:03:38.980
No, no, it reproduces asexually.

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:42.526
That's why we have to find the nest
as soon as possible.

01:03:42.693 --> 01:03:44.694
Otherwise up to a dozen
will be born...

01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:48.740
...each one capable of laying eggs
on its own.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:51.743
Very quickly we could be
looking at an enormous population.

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:54.746
So after we kill the creature,
then we search for the nest.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:57.040
No, I think it might be too late
by then.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:59.543
These eggs are going
to hatch very quickly.

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.379
- How could you possibly know that?
- The fish.

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.423
The fish that we found
on the subway.

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:08.385
He's not collecting all this food
just for himself.

01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:11.263
He's preparing to feed his young.

01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:17.143
Do we have something on this guy?

01:04:19.772 --> 01:04:23.233
Professor Nick Ta... Tat... Tato...

01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:26.611
They call him "the worm guy."

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:33.410
Stay tuned for a special report.

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:36.121
Excuse us, please. Where you been?

01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:38.790
- Your spot is up right after this.
- Oh, good.

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:44.254
- Could you turn it up, please?
- Can you turn it up, please? The TV?

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:48.466
If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we have to act
quickly, before this problem escalates.

01:04:48.634 --> 01:04:51.803
You want to divide our efferts based
solely on some wild theory?

01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:54.806
Sir, Nick's come through
for us before, and if he feels...

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.642
Come through for you?
Your campaign's a disaster.

01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:00.770
You weren't even able to
keep this thing out of Manhattan.

01:05:00.938 --> 01:05:04.482
Excuse me, gentlemen,
but I think we should see this.

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:09.029
- Methods and motivations of
Manhattan's newest unwanted pest.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:14.826
"Godzilla."

01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:19.289
That's what Japanese sailors called him
in song, a mythological sea dragon...

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:21.333
...who filled their hearts with fear.

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:24.169
- Oh, my God! He stole my report!
- Yeah, I know.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:26.880
That myth has become reality,
our modern-day terror.

01:05:27.048 --> 01:05:29.716
- I don't believe it!
- Who is this Godzilla?

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:33.011
Where did he come from?
Why is he here?

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:36.556
And it's "Gojira, you moron!

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:40.477
A direct path can be traced from
Manhattan to French Polynesia...

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:43.355
...where nuclear tests have been
going on for two decades.

01:05:43.522 --> 01:05:47.609
Researcher Dr. Tapadopoulos believes
the creature may be nesting...

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.904
...using Manhattan as ground zero
to cultivate the species.

01:05:51.072 --> 01:05:54.407
This, despite the fact that the
combined might of the U.S. Military...

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.201
...has been unable to subdue...

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:58.745
- You went to the press with this?
- No.

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:02.040
- No, I haven't talked to anyone.
- They mentioned you by name!

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.500
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:07.420
- You gave them the tape?
- No, I didn't give them the tape.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.423
No, it's in my tent right now.

01:06:10.591 --> 01:06:12.384
Oh, my God.

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:14.886
Oh, my God, she took it.

01:06:17.598 --> 01:06:22.102
Pack your stuff, mister. You're
officially off this project, as of now.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.615
What's going on?

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.453
We're leaving.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.796
I'm so sorry about all this.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:58.096
Make sure that Hicks finds that nest
before it's too late.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.765
I'll try.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:14.279
What do you mean, he's not there?

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:16.781
A second ago you said
he was on the other line.

01:07:16.949 --> 01:07:20.493
Please, it's urgent. I really need to
talk to him. Yes. Nick Tatopoulos.

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:37.343
You're leaving? Why?

01:07:38.262 --> 01:07:41.473
Is it because of me?
Because of the story?

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:46.770
- What did you think would happen?
- You never said it was off the record.

01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:51.316
I shouldn't have to, Audrey.
You were supposed to be my friend.

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:53.109
I trusted you.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:00.200
Nick, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:05.205
Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter.

01:08:08.959 --> 01:08:15.215
When we broke up and I first came out
to New York, I was so sure I'd make it.

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:17.008
But I haven't.

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:21.386
That's why
I needed the story so bad.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:24.224
I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.566
And you thought that made it okay
to steal my tapes?

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:37.987
No. It was a terrible thing to do.
I never should've have done that.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:49.082
Good luck with your new career.
I really think you have what it takes.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.209
Newark Airport.

01:09:01.053 --> 01:09:02.761
I'm sorry.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:09.394
Hey, yo! Come on, give her a break,
will you?

01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:41.634
Excuse me, is this the best way
to the airport?

01:09:47.099 --> 01:09:51.769
Sir, where are you going?
Hey, hello!

01:09:55.107 --> 01:09:58.776
Okay, stop. Stop the car, right now.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.654
Now let me out of here.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:06.534
I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:10:09.246 --> 01:10:10.955
Hey, I know you, don't I?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.128
- Yeah. You're that insurance guy.
- Agent Philippe Roaché.

01:10:21.842 --> 01:10:23.468
Sounds big.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:27.555
French Secret Service.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.977
I thought you'd like to know
that your American friends...

01:10:33.145 --> 01:10:36.189
...have decided not to look
for the creature's nest.

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:39.317
What? Are you sure?
How do you know that?

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:42.403
- We know. Trust me.
- Trust you?

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.490
You hijack me
and you expect me to trust you?

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.034
- Yes.
- And why should I do that?

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:54.499
Because you are the only one who
wants to find the nest as much as I do.

01:11:21.193 --> 01:11:23.528
How did you get all this stuff
into the country?

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:26.281
This is America.
You can buy anything.

01:11:27.157 --> 01:11:28.533
But why all the secrecy?

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:31.077
Why aren't you guys
working with the U.S. Military?

01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:34.330
I'm not permitted
to speak of such things.

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:39.043
Hey, you said you needed my trust.
Well, then I need yours.

01:11:41.755 --> 01:11:45.091
I am a patriot. I love my country.
You understand that?

01:11:45.342 --> 01:11:46.592
Sure.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.803
It's my job to protect my country.

01:11:49.179 --> 01:11:53.641
Sometimes I must even protect it from
itself. From mistakes we've made.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:56.686
Mistakes that we don't want
the world to know about.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:59.939
- The nuclear tests in the Pacific?
- Yes.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:03.401
This testing done by my country
left a terrible mess.

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:05.987
We're here to clean it up.

01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:19.751
They are setting the next fish trap
at 8-something.

01:12:20.377 --> 01:12:25.590
We know how to get into the city'
we just don't know where to look.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:36.309
Here. This is the 23rd Street
subway station.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:40.271
That's where we first found the fish.
That'd a good place to start looking.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.106
So you're in?

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:47.487
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

01:12:50.824 --> 01:12:53.868
I always wanted to join
the French Foreign Legion.

01:13:04.838 --> 01:13:06.964
- Hello.
- How's it going?

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.017
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.645
- Honey.
- Hi, sweetie.

01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:23.189
- Who the hell are all these people?
- What?

01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:26.401
I couldn't just let them
sleep on the street.

01:13:30.447 --> 01:13:32.198
- Where's Audrey?
- In the bedroom.

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:35.159
- Crying her eyes out because of you.
- Me?

01:13:35.327 --> 01:13:36.661
What did I do?

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:39.497
All that "You gotta be vicious" stuff
you filled her head with.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.667
- Get out of here!
- Go in there and talk to her right now.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:45.044
Is it being with you?
Excuse me.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.255
Contrary to some frivolous reporting...

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:51.676
...we have absolutely no information
whatsoever to make us believe...

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:54.804
...that there are any eggs
of the creature in the city.

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:59.559
There's no need for panic.
Repeat, there's no reason to panic.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:03.771
It's all my fault.

01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:08.192
What have I done, Animal?
What have I become?

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.071
Look at me. This isn't me.
I don't do stuff like this.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:14.615
You made a mistake. All right?
It happens.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:16.868
Yeah, well...

01:14:17.035 --> 01:14:21.038
...I just totally screwed up with the
only man who will ever care about me.

01:14:21.206 --> 01:14:23.875
If I told you you could
make it all up to him, would you?

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:25.543
Of course I would.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:31.382
Get this. After he left you in the street,
I kind of followed him.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:34.093
I figured I'd talk some sense
into the guy.

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:36.596
Next thing I know,
he pulls into this warehouse...

01:14:36.763 --> 01:14:39.891
...with all these French wackos
in military outfits.

01:14:40.058 --> 01:14:42.727
They wanna try to sneak
back into the city tonight.

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:45.605
They're going after the nest.

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:49.484
If he finds it, I think you should be
the one to let the whole world know...

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.194
...that he was right all along.

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:54.280
You want me to follow him
into the city?

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.450
Yeah, we both will.

01:14:57.618 --> 01:15:02.997
- Come on, it'll be fun, it'll be fun.
- I already made a mess of everything.

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.999
Yeah, you really did, Audrey.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:08.586
Listen, I'm going after him.
You can go with me, or not. Okay?

01:15:12.424 --> 01:15:17.762
- What are you doing?
- Can't let Lucy know. She'll hurt me.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.823
What's with the chewing gum?

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:41.244
It makes us look more American.

01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:42.995
Oh, really?

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:49.460
Just let me do all the talking.
All right?

01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:55.633
It's not in gear.

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:07.687
Follow me. This way.

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:13.859
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.495
Come on.

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:26.163
What is this place?

01:16:26.331 --> 01:16:29.375
It's a vent that leads down
to the subway tunnels underneath.

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:32.837
It should take us right to
the 23rd Street station in Manhattan.

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:39.010
You gotta be kidding me.
Aren't there rats and stuff down here?

01:16:39.177 --> 01:16:45.349
I'm more concerned about lizards.
Big, ugly, nasty, large lizards.

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.994
Who are you boys with?

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:10.708
- We're with the 3-2, sir.
- I didn't ask you, soldier.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:13.836
Well, Sergeant O'Neal
just called down for us.

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:16.589
He wants us to join him right now.
Sir. Thank you.

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:23.471
- Have you got a problem talking?
- Why, no, sir. I'm fine.

01:17:25.223 --> 01:17:26.724
Come on, let's go!

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:31.687
- All right. Keep it moving.
- Thank you very much.

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:41.572
Elvis Presley movies.
He was the king.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:50.748
- Sir, O'Neal on the line.
- O'Neal, do you read me?

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:57.588
- O'Neal.
- How are we doing?

01:17:57.756 --> 01:18:01.592
So far, so good.
We're right on schedule.

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:06.347
We're good.
We're... We're good.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:23.406
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:26.450
There they are. Kill your light.
Kill your light.

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:31.455
Come on, how do we get down there?
We're gonna lose them.

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:43.426
- How did they get down there?
- I don't know.

01:18:45.345 --> 01:18:47.805
You don't think
they climbed down this thing?

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.473
Oh, Jesus!

01:19:06.199 --> 01:19:08.075
Careful.

01:19:13.874 --> 01:19:15.875
- Give me your hand.
- I got you.

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:30.306
- Do you hear that?
- What?

01:20:13.433 --> 01:20:15.434
Animal, come on!

01:20:55.767 --> 01:20:58.185
I guess we go this way.

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:20.583
We've spotted him in section five.

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:23.752
Combat positions. Here we go!

01:21:28.466 --> 01:21:31.468
Target's heading north
to section five.

01:21:31.636 --> 01:21:36.974
Do not fire until he has cleared
the buildings and enters the park!

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:05.312
Wait until he enters the park.

01:23:20.578 --> 01:23:22.204
Come on.

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:31.714
He's leaving! Damn it! Fire!
Fire at will!

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:40.514
Damn!

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:53.652
Fire!

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.617
Fly to evasive maneuvers.

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:11.962
The target is in the clear and headed
towards the West Side Highway.

01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:33.442
Don't worry. The Navy has a little
something there waiting for him.

01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:44.703
- All stations manned for battle.
- At ordered depth, sir.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:46.789
We have him on sonar.
Utah closing in.

01:24:46.956 --> 01:24:48.832
Make final preparations,
prepare to fire.

01:24:57.509 --> 01:25:01.011
- Aye, aye, manned and ready.
- Torpedo room manned and ready.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.472
- Final bearing and shoot.
- Are we locked on?

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:09.353
- Are we locked on? Locked on, captain.
- Number one, stand by.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:12.940
- Fire.
- Torpedo one left the tube.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:27.538
Indiana and Anchorage closing in.

01:25:27.705 --> 01:25:31.208
- Ensign, what's the status?
- We are locked on and closing in, sir.

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:32.835
Fire number one.

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:57.526
- Sir! The target's heading right at us!
- All back full!

01:25:57.694 --> 01:26:00.237
Aye, aye, sir. All back full.

01:26:07.745 --> 01:26:10.706
Stand by for impact. In 10 seconds.

01:26:15.378 --> 01:26:18.964
Six, five, four...

01:26:19.132 --> 01:26:22.092
...three, two, one.

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:44.031
We've lost the Anchorage, sir.

01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:54.958
He's shifted course, sir.

01:26:55.126 --> 01:26:58.503
- He's headed back towards Manhattan.
- Full ahead. Close in, lock on.

01:26:58.671 --> 01:27:01.840
- Prepare tubes three and four, lock on.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:12.935
- Stand by, three. Fire.
- Torpedo three cleared and left the tube.

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:22.861
Impact in eight seconds.
Seven, six...

01:27:28.785 --> 01:27:31.995
Three, two, one.

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:41.505
- Direct hit!
- Got him.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.676
- Congratulations, sir.
- Good job.

01:27:46.803 --> 01:27:48.845
Yeah, well done.

01:28:29.387 --> 01:28:31.555
What's up there?

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:56.913
This is a good smell.

01:28:59.917 --> 01:29:03.795
Audrey, look at this.
He trashed the Garden.

01:29:04.297 --> 01:29:07.883
Oh, man! Now I'm pissed.

01:29:09.802 --> 01:29:12.512
- Is that them?
- Yeah.

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:52.135
Three eggs.
I thought there'd be more.

01:29:52.303 --> 01:29:54.388
And you were right.

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.984
Oh, my.

01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:13.031
There's gotta be
more than 20 eggs here.

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.534
Way more.

01:30:35.012 --> 01:30:37.222
Start counting.

01:30:49.902 --> 01:30:52.571
- Could you help me?
- Yeah, you all right?

01:30:55.366 --> 01:30:57.033
There.

01:31:20.558 --> 01:31:22.225
We don't have enough explosives.

01:31:30.318 --> 01:31:32.819
What the hell are they doing?

01:32:07.647 --> 01:32:10.732
Nick, we have a problem.

01:32:47.019 --> 01:32:49.729
Oh, my God. My God!

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.773
Come on. Let's go!

01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:55.652
One second, all right?
One second. This is unbelievable.

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:11.459
Don't you think
we have enough already?

01:33:11.627 --> 01:33:13.169
I just want...

01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:21.177
Yeah, that's good for me.
That's plenty.

01:33:24.807 --> 01:33:26.808
We should...

01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:35.859
Just let's not...

01:33:36.235 --> 01:33:38.069
...startle it.

01:33:47.079 --> 01:33:49.372
We smell like the fish.

01:33:49.540 --> 01:33:52.542
- I think we should leave now.
- I think that's a good idea.

01:34:19.862 --> 01:34:21.321
Come on!

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:31.539
- Everybody outside! Now!
- Come on. Let's go.

01:34:47.598 --> 01:34:53.520
Lock the doors now! We have to keep
them contained inside. Let's go!

01:35:54.457 --> 01:35:57.375
- You see that?
- All right. On three.

01:35:58.002 --> 01:35:59.043
Three!

01:36:10.639 --> 01:36:13.892
This is where the Knicks
get showered and everything.

01:36:20.524 --> 01:36:23.401
Great. Now what do we do?

01:36:25.362 --> 01:36:28.823
I'm standing just outside the Jersey
entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.

01:36:28.991 --> 01:36:33.703
Thousands of angry refugees are
demanding to be let back into the city.

01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:36.956
All major arteries into the city
are clogged with Manhattanites...

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:38.875
...who are jubilant that Godzilla...

01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:40.919
Yes, yes, I understand.

01:36:41.086 --> 01:36:44.506
- Your office is swamped with calls.
- I know, I know!

01:36:44.673 --> 01:36:46.883
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

01:36:47.051 --> 01:36:50.386
Phones are ringing off the hook.
People are screaming to be let back in.

01:36:50.554 --> 01:36:52.722
We're sending divers into the river
for the body.

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:54.766
That thing's dead.
What are you waiting for?

01:36:54.934 --> 01:36:58.436
Colonel. Colonel, we've gotta
start a search for the nest.

01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:00.355
We've been through this already.

01:37:00.523 --> 01:37:03.066
What if Nick is right,
and we blow this whole thing?

01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:06.194
This could be the only chance
we have to do something about it.

01:37:10.032 --> 01:37:12.075
Captain, organize a search party.

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:15.286
I want a complete sweep of
the entire city and the subway.

01:37:15.454 --> 01:37:17.580
You don't have
the authority to do that.

01:37:17.873 --> 01:37:19.791
Try and stop me.

01:37:32.304 --> 01:37:36.891
Contact the military. Get them to send
a bomber to blow up this building.

01:37:37.059 --> 01:37:41.312
- How do I do that?
- 555-7600.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:44.899
Tell them it's a Code Dragonfly.
That should get you through.

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:49.821
- What are you waiting for?
- 555 what?

01:37:49.989 --> 01:37:54.742
- 7600.
- 7600.

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:01.457
- All circuits are busy right now.
- It's busy.

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:02.750
Try again.

01:38:13.512 --> 01:38:14.846
What did they say?

01:38:16.181 --> 01:38:18.975
I can't get through.
I don't know what's wrong.

01:38:21.645 --> 01:38:23.563
We secured the doors
on the upper levels.

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:25.940
Where are Jean-Philippe
and Jean-Pierre?

01:38:26.108 --> 01:38:27.317
They didn't make it.

01:38:29.987 --> 01:38:34.741
Nick, my men and I will hold them here.
You'll have to go and get help.

01:38:53.344 --> 01:38:55.929
You think we could fit up in there?

01:38:58.349 --> 01:39:00.975
There's one way to find out.

01:39:01.685 --> 01:39:05.021
Boost me up. Boost me up.

01:41:15.944 --> 01:41:20.073
This is not good.
This is not good.

01:41:32.169 --> 01:41:33.169
Come on, come on.

01:41:38.008 --> 01:41:39.842
Come on.

01:42:08.872 --> 01:42:10.456
Wrong floor.

01:42:19.383 --> 01:42:21.717
Why don't we go this way?

01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:46.742
- It's me. It's me.
- What happened?

01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:49.912
They're loose. They're all over
the place. I couldn't get out.

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.706
No one can get out.

01:42:55.752 --> 01:42:59.172
- Who the hell are you?
- Audrey?

01:43:01.091 --> 01:43:02.884
Here.

01:43:05.679 --> 01:43:07.430
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

01:43:07.598 --> 01:43:09.682
- No cameras.
- Are you kid...?

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:11.851
Yeah, all right. Very good.

01:43:12.102 --> 01:43:16.397
Do you have a radio or walkie-talkie?
Anything to contact the outside?

01:43:16.607 --> 01:43:20.026
- What about the phones?
- The circuits are all jammed.

01:43:20.527 --> 01:43:24.447
Wait. I know how we can get
a message to the outside.

01:43:33.081 --> 01:43:34.373
This way. Come on.

01:43:37.836 --> 01:43:40.213
The tape. The tape!

01:43:46.803 --> 01:43:47.929
Come on!

01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:03.986
Come on. Come on.

01:44:04.154 --> 01:44:07.156
- The broadcast booth is over here.
- How do you know that?

01:44:07.324 --> 01:44:10.159
Our network covers
the Ranger games.

01:44:12.246 --> 01:44:14.413
- It's locked.
- There's a code. There's a code.

01:44:16.166 --> 01:44:17.500
Come on. Come on!

01:44:22.756 --> 01:44:24.465
I was just about to get it.

01:44:24.633 --> 01:44:28.427
The network's on an intranet. It's a
direct feed to our computer system.

01:44:28.637 --> 01:44:32.014
Your station won't have any easier
time reaching the military than I did.

01:44:32.182 --> 01:44:35.184
When you worked with them,
did they monitor all news broadcasts?

01:44:35.394 --> 01:44:37.186
Yeah. Yeah, they did.

01:44:37.354 --> 01:44:41.399
All right, we'll go live. Audrey'
we'll broadcast right from in here.

01:44:41.566 --> 01:44:46.320
- Hopefully they'll see it.
- I'll try to get a message through.

01:44:58.375 --> 01:45:00.793
Let's not forget in our rush
to return to the city...

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:03.587
...that many people have had
their lives changed forever.

01:45:04.172 --> 01:45:07.133
No one in the city has been
untouched by the frenzy...

01:45:07.301 --> 01:45:11.178
The sick, the displaced,
the injured all need our help...

01:45:15.809 --> 01:45:18.060
There's no Ranger game on tonight.

01:45:21.565 --> 01:45:26.235
Ed, if you're seeing this, will you
please put us on live? It's urgent!

01:45:26.903 --> 01:45:29.613
I know this sounds crazy,
Ed, but you have to do it.

01:45:31.908 --> 01:45:35.953
- Please, just trust me.
- I'm not putting you on live.

01:45:36.121 --> 01:45:38.998
- I don't think he's gonna do it.
- Yes, he will.

01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:42.376
All right, Ed? Come on.

01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:49.467
See that, Ed? They're gonna be
all over the city if we don't stop them.

01:45:50.844 --> 01:45:52.428
Give me a second, will you?

01:45:58.268 --> 01:46:02.188
- Finally it's time to return home.
- Get the diving boats ready.

01:46:03.273 --> 01:46:05.316
Our fears have been allayed...

01:46:05.484 --> 01:46:08.778
...thanks to the heroic efforts
of our boys in uniform.

01:46:09.446 --> 01:46:10.613
Are we on?

01:46:13.367 --> 01:46:15.242
- Yeah, good, you're on.
- Are we live?

01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:17.370
Yes, yes. You're on. Go!

01:46:18.121 --> 01:46:20.289
We're live inside
Madison Square Garden...

01:46:20.457 --> 01:46:23.876
...where Niko Dr. Tatopoulos has
discovered the beast's lair.

01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:26.545
Doctor, can you please tell us
what's happening here?

01:46:28.965 --> 01:46:31.634
- That's you. Yes, go, go.
- Thank you.

01:46:31.802 --> 01:46:35.721
Yeah, well, we've discovered
over 200 eggs...

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:37.681
Go get Hicks. Get Hicks!

01:46:37.849 --> 01:46:40.643
...which, a few moments ago,
began hatching.

01:46:41.728 --> 01:46:45.689
The creatures, though just hatched,
are over 9 feet tall...

01:46:45.857 --> 01:46:48.150
...and they've begun feeding.

01:46:49.986 --> 01:46:52.405
When their food supply
runs out here...

01:46:52.572 --> 01:46:56.992
...they will attempt to hunt down food
of their own outside of this nest.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.994
Oh, my God.

01:46:59.162 --> 01:47:03.332
If they get out, they'll multiply, and
very soon a new species will emerge.

01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:08.337
One that could replace us as
the dominant species of this planet.

01:47:08.505 --> 01:47:13.092
Each one of these amazing reptiles
are born pregnant.

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:19.598
Adaptive and cunning, these 200
could become 40,000 within this year.

01:47:19.766 --> 01:47:22.143
If the military is listening
to this broadcast...

01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:24.979
...they have to destroy
this building immediately...

01:47:25.147 --> 01:47:26.981
...before these creatures
can escape.

01:47:33.321 --> 01:47:35.990
So far, they're all trapped
inside this building...

01:47:36.158 --> 01:47:38.868
...but I don't think we can
contain them for long.

01:47:39.035 --> 01:47:44.373
They're very strong, they're agile,
and they're looking for food.

01:47:44.541 --> 01:47:46.876
So I guess your theory
of the creature nesting...

01:47:47.043 --> 01:47:49.253
...turned out to be correct after all.

01:47:51.339 --> 01:47:54.884
Regardless of what happens to us,
the most important thing...

01:47:55.051 --> 01:47:57.428
...is that this building
be destroyed immediately...

01:47:57.596 --> 01:47:59.305
...before they can escape
into the city.

01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:01.724
Reporting live from
Madison Square Garden...

01:48:01.892 --> 01:48:05.060
...this is Audrey Timmonds'
for WIDF News.

01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:12.318
Thanks, Audrey.

01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:14.904
Sure.

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:27.082
That's affirmative.
Let me spell it out for you.

01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:30.252
I want you to blow up
Madison Square Garden.

01:48:38.136 --> 01:48:40.304
Well, the good news
is they got that message.

01:48:40.472 --> 01:48:44.558
The bad news is we've got less than
six minutes to get out of the building.

01:48:44.726 --> 01:48:47.645
Okay, the party's over.
Time to leave.

01:49:02.661 --> 01:49:05.496
Anyone care to join me?

01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:11.669
- Where did you find this guy?
- He's from France.

01:49:15.298 --> 01:49:17.508
Stallion 1-5 is inbound.

01:49:23.974 --> 01:49:25.057
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:49:26.685 --> 01:49:29.144
Guys, this way. Come on.

01:49:30.021 --> 01:49:31.772
Oh, my God. The fish!

01:49:32.649 --> 01:49:34.525
Nick, come on!

01:49:34.693 --> 01:49:37.069
They've eaten all the fish.

01:49:46.037 --> 01:49:47.871
Come on, Nick, this way.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.419
Not this way, back that way!

01:50:05.015 --> 01:50:07.433
- The escalators!
- Hurry!

01:50:27.370 --> 01:50:30.956
Stallions, check master arms on.
Two, three.

01:50:41.259 --> 01:50:42.968
I think I lost them.

01:51:02.989 --> 01:51:07.534
Stallion 1-5 showing a good laser track
on top of the Garden. Selecting LGB.

01:51:07.952 --> 01:51:09.870
How much time do we have left?

01:51:10.914 --> 01:51:13.666
- Less than 30 seconds.
- Oh, God!

01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:25.886
Let's go!

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:40.150
Let's go, come on!

01:51:52.997 --> 01:51:54.707
Come on! Come on!

01:51:59.963 --> 01:52:01.255
Send your Mavericks.

01:52:03.299 --> 01:52:04.925
Two away.

01:52:22.193 --> 01:52:24.611
Lead has good hits.

01:52:41.713 --> 01:52:45.382
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:49.970
Somehow I never thought
your life was this exciting.

01:52:50.138 --> 01:52:52.097
You'd be surprised.

01:52:53.808 --> 01:52:56.185
I'd like to find out.

01:53:09.032 --> 01:53:13.619
- How are you doing? You all right?
- I could use a coffee.

01:54:11.052 --> 01:54:12.386
He looks angry.

01:54:16.307 --> 01:54:19.852
- What do we do?
- Running would be a good idea.

01:54:20.687 --> 01:54:22.938
Let's go!

01:54:46.004 --> 01:54:47.546
Come on. Come on!

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:02.352
- Get in, get in.
- What are you doing?

01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:42.100
You better step on it, Mr. French.

01:55:51.694 --> 01:55:54.071
Take 57th across town
and cut up the West Side.

01:55:54.238 --> 01:55:56.073
No, are you crazy? Take the FDR.

01:55:57.367 --> 01:55:59.952
- Please! The FDR, in the rain?
- There ought to be a map.

01:56:01.704 --> 01:56:03.664
It's getting larger.

01:56:13.591 --> 01:56:15.175
Take the Westside Highway.

01:56:17.428 --> 01:56:20.138
- I got one.
- No, the West Side's got construction.

01:56:20.306 --> 01:56:21.807
This is a subway map!

01:56:24.352 --> 01:56:25.894
- Broadway?
- No, no.

01:56:26.729 --> 01:56:28.438
Make up your minds!

01:56:36.823 --> 01:56:38.907
Broadway! Take Broadway!

01:56:39.075 --> 01:56:43.120
Affirmative.
We're traveling down Broadway and...

01:56:43.287 --> 01:56:45.706
...make a right on 34th Street.

01:57:01.305 --> 01:57:04.433
- That was O'Neal!
- Everybody okay? Everybody all right?

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:06.059
- Turn around. Do it!
- What?

01:57:06.227 --> 01:57:07.477
- No.
- What? Why?

01:57:21.451 --> 01:57:24.453
Command Center, come in.
Command, this is O'Neal...

01:57:31.085 --> 01:57:32.461
O'Neal!

01:57:46.517 --> 01:57:50.020
- O'Neal, what's going on?
- He's back, sir. He's back.

01:57:50.188 --> 01:57:52.981
Godzilla is still alive.

01:57:54.275 --> 01:57:57.152
Lieutenant Rodgers, are those
F-18's still in the air?

01:57:57.320 --> 01:58:01.031
- Yes, sir. They're heading back to base.
- Turn them around.

01:58:32.355 --> 01:58:35.232
- Here it is. Here it is.
- Sir, what are we looking for?

01:58:35.441 --> 01:58:41.655
Every cab company keeps a record
of each of its cabs, radio frequencies.

01:58:45.827 --> 01:58:46.868
Bingo.

01:58:53.084 --> 01:58:54.376
He's getting closer.

01:58:57.964 --> 01:59:01.007
There, there! The tunnel!
Go in the tunnel.

01:59:07.598 --> 01:59:09.683
They've got it blocked off.

01:59:18.109 --> 01:59:21.653
- Now where would you like to go?
- Turn off the lights.

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:31.580
Nick, are you there? Nick?

01:59:32.415 --> 01:59:34.124
O'Neal?

01:59:34.292 --> 01:59:36.001
Nice trick with the cab ID.

01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:38.712
- Where the hell are you?
- You have to help us.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:40.130
We're in the...

01:59:40.298 --> 01:59:43.091
- Park Avenue Tunnel.
- Park Avenue Tunnel.

01:59:52.435 --> 01:59:54.811
He's got us trapped in here.
- Listen to me.

01:59:54.979 --> 01:59:57.480
You guys have got to
lure him out into the open.

01:59:57.648 --> 01:59:59.816
So we can get
a clear shot at him. Over.

01:59:59.984 --> 02:00:02.485
No problem. Want us to
wash him up for you too?

02:00:06.532 --> 02:00:08.325
Where's the nearest
suspension bridge?

02:00:08.576 --> 02:00:09.701
Brooklyn. Brooklyn.

02:00:11.829 --> 02:00:15.165
- Let's go.
- How would you like us to do that?

02:00:15.333 --> 02:00:17.500
Does this thing have high beams?

02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:26.801
Now!

02:00:36.812 --> 02:00:38.813
Sir, he's headed toward
the Brooklyn Bridge.

02:00:38.981 --> 02:00:41.441
Target is heading
toward the Brooklyn Bridge.

02:00:41.609 --> 02:00:43.818
Direct the F-18's
to the Brooklyn Bridge.

02:00:50.868 --> 02:00:53.578
- He's not following us.
- Really?

02:01:14.392 --> 02:01:15.976
Oh, my God!

02:01:16.185 --> 02:01:18.728
You gotta be kidding me, man.
We're in his mouth!

02:01:18.896 --> 02:01:21.273
We're in his mouth!

02:01:25.653 --> 02:01:27.237
You're going the wrong way.

02:01:27.405 --> 02:01:29.698
- You're going the wrong way.
- Shut up!

02:01:47.842 --> 02:01:49.759
Okay, gun it! Gun it! Go, go, go!

02:02:04.734 --> 02:02:05.775
Go, go, go!

02:02:18.456 --> 02:02:20.415
Move it, move it, move it!

02:02:42.730 --> 02:02:44.981
O'Neal! O'Neal, it worked!

02:02:50.488 --> 02:02:52.197
He's caught
in the suspension cables.

02:02:52.365 --> 02:02:54.407
- Do it! Now!
- Roger that.

02:02:57.828 --> 02:03:00.789
Stallion 1-5, tally one on the bridge.

02:03:02.124 --> 02:03:03.750
Lock on and fire at will.

02:03:07.129 --> 02:03:08.421
Two away.

02:03:39.537 --> 02:03:42.247
Direct hit, but the target
is still moving, sir.

02:03:42.415 --> 02:03:44.541
Well, circle around and fire again!

02:06:12.314 --> 02:06:16.192
That's my husband!
That's my husband!

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:19.696
Oh, my... I'm gonna kill him.

02:06:26.537 --> 02:06:30.623
Oh, my. Oh, God. Oh, no.

02:06:36.338 --> 02:06:39.632
Wait. We can use this.

02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:43.261
- "The mayor who destroyed Godzilla."
- I don't think we should exploit this.

02:06:43.429 --> 02:06:45.388
- It could backfire.
- Listen to me, idiot.

02:06:45.556 --> 02:06:48.891
I do the thinking here, you idiot.
It's a magnificent idea.

02:06:49.059 --> 02:06:51.894
You know what I think about you
and your campaign?

02:06:53.439 --> 02:06:55.398
Gene, where you going? I need you.

02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.984
O'Neal, do you read me?

02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:01.279
Yes, sir.

02:07:01.447 --> 02:07:03.948
That's one hell of a job, soldier.

02:07:05.034 --> 02:07:07.577
That's one hell of a job.

02:07:11.582 --> 02:07:13.833
Roger that, sir.

02:07:15.878 --> 02:07:19.922
Sorry, folks, I've already promised
my story as an exclusive...

02:07:20.090 --> 02:07:22.508
...to another reporter.

02:07:22.676 --> 02:07:27.847
We did it! We got the exclusive!
Audrey, you're beautiful.

02:07:28.015 --> 02:07:32.185
- We did? I don't think so.
- Remember, you work for me.

02:07:32.353 --> 02:07:36.397
Not anymore, Chuck. I quit.

02:07:38.233 --> 02:07:42.195
- But you...
- She quits.

02:07:51.497 --> 02:07:53.706
Audrey. Audrey.

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.250
Did you take the tape
from the camera?

02:07:56.418 --> 02:07:57.585
No.

02:07:57.753 --> 02:08:01.339
- I mean, I couldn't have just lost it.
- Where's Philippe?

02:08:10.766 --> 02:08:12.934
Hello? Hello?

02:08:13.102 --> 02:08:16.104
- It's Philippe.
- Where are you?

02:08:16.271 --> 02:08:18.064
Tell you friend I'll send the tape...

02:08:18.232 --> 02:08:20.483
...after I've removed
a few items from it.

02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:24.153
- I understand.
- I just wanted to say au revoir.

02:08:24.321 --> 02:08:27.949
Thank you for your help, my friend.

02:08:29.535 --> 02:08:32.120
Well, wait... Hello?

02:08:35.035 --> 02:08:35.620
Revoir.

02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:45.883
Who was that French guy anyway?

02:08:46.468 --> 02:08:48.845
Just some insurance guy.

02:08:50.806 --> 02:08:53.641
Did he take my...?
Did he say anything about my tape?

02:08:53.892 --> 02:08:56.102
Yeah, he said something
about your tape.

02:08:56.270 --> 02:09:00.648
- Does he have my tape?
- Yeah, he has your tape.

02:09:00.816 --> 02:09:03.151
You'll get it back.

02:09:50.151 --> 03:09:03.151
