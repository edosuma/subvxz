Welcome to the new economy, America.

00:04.233 --> 00:05.800
<i>You open your mouth, and the damage</i>

00:05.834 --> 00:07.101
<i>just spills right out.</i>

00:07.136 --> 00:08.536
<i>My name is Marty kaan</i>

00:08.570 --> 00:09.971
<i>and I'm a management consultant.</i>

00:10.005 --> 00:11.839
How do you make improvements
on a masterpiece?

00:11.874 --> 00:13.474
<i>Me and my team talk people</i>
<i>into thinking</i>

00:13.509 --> 00:15.143
<i>they really need us...</i>
<i>Just enough</i>

00:15.177 --> 00:16.309
to sell them some more.

00:16.344 --> 00:18.813
We're paying out the ass
for top-tier consulting firms.

00:18.847 --> 00:21.516
Why not acquire one?
You will be ours.

00:21.550 --> 00:23.651
With this potential merger coming up,

00:23.685 --> 00:25.753
<i>all of our asses are on the line.</i>

00:25.788 --> 00:27.955
Our asses are on the
line because of you.

00:27.990 --> 00:29.957
Clyde oberholt has just been
named in the 25 under 30

00:29.992 --> 00:31.459
of management consultants.

00:31.493 --> 00:33.027
Boom!
<i>You think I don't see all</i>

00:33.062 --> 00:33.962
your fucking teacher's
pet ass kissing every day?

00:33.963 --> 00:34.862
What?

00:34.897 --> 00:36.631
What do you mean, "what?"
Marty's my mentor.

00:36.665 --> 00:38.266
No, he's not, Doug. He's not.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.101
<i>You go home and do what you can</i>
<i>to cope with the shift.</i>

00:40.135 --> 00:41.969
Hey, dad?
Huh! Yeah?

00:42.004 --> 00:43.104
What's mom doing here?

00:43.138 --> 00:45.540
<i>Don't ever fuck your ex-wife.</i>

00:45.574 --> 00:47.208
Our son is a tranny for life.

00:47.242 --> 00:49.477
<i>Be expecting a call from my lawyers.</i>

00:49.511 --> 00:51.512
I want custody of Roscoe.

00:51.547 --> 00:52.780
<i>She can't take him, dad.</i>

00:52.815 --> 00:55.316
She didn't take him.
He went.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.717
<i>There's an 87% likelihood</i>

00:56.752 --> 00:59.153
that we're gonna sleep together, so...

00:59.188 --> 01:00.221
Oh, my God.
What?

01:00.255 --> 01:01.656
<i>Certain partners have been using</i>

01:01.690 --> 01:03.624
<i>their considerable influence</i>
<i>to bang the hotter,</i>

01:03.659 --> 01:05.025
younger elements of the company.

01:05.060 --> 01:07.795
He promised my fast rise to partner.

01:07.830 --> 01:10.298
The merger's dead.

01:10.332 --> 01:11.499
Namaste!

01:12.501 --> 01:13.668
You are sluticus!

01:16.505 --> 01:18.573
I've been behaving badly.
Seriously?

01:18.607 --> 01:21.142
<i>So you blew up your life for the job.</i>

01:21.176 --> 01:22.810
You blow up your life
every day for the job.

01:22.845 --> 01:24.011
To the...
Motherfucking...

01:24.046 --> 01:25.680
Blower...
Uppers.

01:25.714 --> 01:28.216
<i>Still don't know what it is we do?</i>

01:28.250 --> 01:30.518
<i>Hmm, then I guess we're doing it well.</i>

Hey, Jeannie.
Marty.

02:07.623 --> 02:09.789
Well, you look rested.

02:09.824 --> 02:11.392
Seriously?

02:11.426 --> 02:13.794
Uh, no. I was just being polite.
You look like shit.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.796
Ah, there he is.

02:15.831 --> 02:18.299
No, but seriously,
how-how you doing? How you been?

02:18.333 --> 02:21.302
You know, I fucked my boss,
told the whole company,

02:21.336 --> 02:22.603
left my handsome rich fiancé

02:22.638 --> 02:25.106
and got kicked out of our
stunning downtown loft,

02:25.140 --> 02:27.141
was forced to take a
two-week paid vacation

02:27.176 --> 02:28.609
to think about what a
naughty girl I've been,

02:28.644 --> 02:32.213
and decide whether or not
I want to sue my employer.

02:32.247 --> 02:33.948
I think that's everything.

02:33.982 --> 02:36.017
Am I leaving out...?
Oh, chlamydia.

02:38.353 --> 02:41.222
Wow. So...

02:41.256 --> 02:43.424
- Work?
- Uh, for... Yeah, let's go.

02:43.458 --> 02:44.792
Yeah. Let's,
probably go to work.

02:44.826 --> 02:46.360
But you don't really
have chlamydia, do you?

02:47.563 --> 02:49.030
I wish I was joking.

02:49.064 --> 02:53.301
Um, Marty,
I-I don't really...

02:53.335 --> 02:57.271
Because a lot of weird stuff
happened that night.

02:57.306 --> 02:58.539
I mean a lot yeah.

02:58.574 --> 03:00.408
Of really weird shit went down

03:00.442 --> 03:02.577
with the rainmaker, with you, with me.

03:02.611 --> 03:06.214
And when I left the hotel,

03:06.248 --> 03:09.850
I didn't have any underpants.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.285
Wow. There's people
right there.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.655
And I'm not sure if, um, we...

03:14.690 --> 03:15.957
Did we...?

03:15.991 --> 03:18.326
Here's the thing.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.860
I'm just gonna.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.062
Be honest right now, Marty.

03:21.096 --> 03:23.965
I blacked out, so I don't know if...

03:23.999 --> 03:25.433
Did we...?

03:25.467 --> 03:27.301
I'm not saying for a fact that we did,

03:27.336 --> 03:28.536
- but did we?
- Well, you know what?

03:28.570 --> 03:30.938
You know what? I'm
sure that we didn't.

03:30.973 --> 03:32.273
This is a conversation
that we definitely need to have.

03:32.307 --> 03:33.808
We need to have this discussion,

03:33.842 --> 03:35.209
but I don't know if we need
to do it at this moment.

03:35.244 --> 03:36.611
Okay.

03:36.645 --> 03:37.979
At this point, Marty, I'm not even sure

03:38.013 --> 03:39.547
who I am anymore, so if, um...

03:39.581 --> 03:41.182
Yeah, right.
There's a lot of people.

03:41.216 --> 03:42.783
Okay, but if we could just get
this one little thing cleared up.

03:42.818 --> 03:43.985
Saying it more quietly doesn't help.

03:44.019 --> 03:45.486
There's a lot of people.
I know.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.622
Yeah, there's a lot of people
in the elevator.

03:59.301 --> 04:01.469
Marty?

04:01.503 --> 04:02.637
Marty, did we...?

04:02.671 --> 04:04.238
Jeannie, please,
can we just focus, okay?

04:04.273 --> 04:05.740
We got to step into this meeting

04:05.774 --> 04:07.275
- with the new queen of galweather,
- I know.

04:07.309 --> 04:08.709
In, like two minutes, all right?

04:08.744 --> 04:10.511
I know, I know, I'm just
trying to figure out...

04:10.545 --> 04:11.696
Because I think...

04:11.697 --> 04:12.847
I mean, the board is
convinced that this one,

04:12.881 --> 04:14.215
she's gonna turn this place around,

04:14.249 --> 04:15.416
take the stink off of it.

04:15.450 --> 04:17.118
Which makes a lot of sense
because she did spend

04:17.152 --> 04:19.887
$100 million of her own dollars

04:19.921 --> 04:22.089
to try and buy
this gubernatorial election.

04:22.124 --> 04:24.058
Didn't work. Shit the bed.
I know, I know.

04:24.092 --> 04:25.993
- Excuse me.
- But I really don't care how much...

04:26.028 --> 04:27.461
So that's the board's wisdom.

04:27.496 --> 04:31.432
Marty, please, can you not just...?

04:32.634 --> 04:33.634
Marty!

04:33.669 --> 04:35.136
Marty!

04:35.170 --> 04:37.371
Jeannie, I don't remember either.

04:37.406 --> 04:40.007
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Welcome back, pass-around Patty.

04:40.042 --> 04:41.676
Thank you, Clyde.
You're welcome.

04:41.710 --> 04:44.178
- That means so much coming from you.
- Yeah, well, I missed you, too.

04:44.212 --> 04:45.780
But you two haven't seen each other

04:45.814 --> 04:47.948
since you've been sidelined,
have you, Jeannie beannie?

04:47.983 --> 04:50.084
- I...
- I mean, not like socially or,

04:50.118 --> 04:52.420
I don't know-- I'm gonna throw
it out there-- fucking?

04:52.454 --> 04:54.288
- Oh, yeah!
- Just like weird, drunk,

04:54.323 --> 04:55.456
sweaty fucking.
Because there was

04:55.490 --> 04:56.824
that night, do you remember, Doug?

04:56.858 --> 04:58.326
- I do. Yeah.
- Do you remember that night?

04:58.360 --> 04:59.760
We were all drinking--
all of us were drinking--

04:59.795 --> 05:01.429
then you two just
disappeared--

05:01.463 --> 05:03.698
that's what I remember--
then there's a gap of time.

05:03.732 --> 05:04.382
Right. Ooh!

05:04.383 --> 05:05.032
I have no idea what you
filled that gap with.

05:05.067 --> 05:07.935
- You know what? We have a pool going.
- Yes.

05:07.969 --> 05:10.171
And right now we're
at five-to-one you guys did it.

05:10.205 --> 05:11.939
- Are you serious? Is this model sound?
- Uh-huh.

05:11.973 --> 05:13.240
Marty's given us no information,

05:13.275 --> 05:15.009
so it is not sound, but we are

05:15.043 --> 05:16.310
gathering data.
We need data.

05:16.345 --> 05:17.278
Meeting, meeting, meeting.

05:17.312 --> 05:19.280
Let's go.
Shit.

05:19.314 --> 05:22.483
Uh, my goodness,

05:22.517 --> 05:24.352
this is quite
a good-looking bunch.

05:24.386 --> 05:27.188
But I'm not being inappropriate
or harassing.

05:27.222 --> 05:29.090
Very good.

05:29.124 --> 05:30.791
I want to introduce myself.

05:30.826 --> 05:32.493
My name is julianne hofschraeger,

05:32.527 --> 05:38.799
and I am the interim ceo here
at the <i>new</i> galweather stearn.

05:42.070 --> 05:46.140
For those of you who are
unfamiliar with my cv,

05:46.174 --> 05:49.310
I turned around a few little
Internet companies

05:49.344 --> 05:51.178
you may have heard of.

05:51.213 --> 05:54.448
I had a very,
just wonderful run for office

05:54.483 --> 05:57.151
that didn't work out exactly
as I had planned.

05:57.185 --> 05:58.886
Shake that off.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.187
Gotta shake it off.

06:01.990 --> 06:05.659
We are building a new company here

06:05.694 --> 06:08.696
based on a fresh ethical reality.

06:08.730 --> 06:12.500
This is the era of women at galweather;

06:12.534 --> 06:17.138
we are bringing in some new
management-level gals,

06:17.172 --> 06:20.508
and internally, we are promoting
our very own

06:20.542 --> 06:22.243
Jeannie Van Der hooven...

06:22.277 --> 06:23.878
Are you kidding me?

06:23.912 --> 06:26.013
To engagement manager.

06:26.047 --> 06:27.648
Manager? That doesn't
even mean anything.

06:27.682 --> 06:30.317
What? Wow!
Congratulations.

06:30.352 --> 06:31.585
Thank you so much.

06:31.620 --> 06:34.755
Well, you know what?
That's enough talk.

06:34.790 --> 06:37.558
Let's get to work
moving this company forward.

06:37.592 --> 06:39.693
Look at you, huh?

06:39.728 --> 06:41.162
Jeannie! How's it feel?

06:41.196 --> 06:44.732
You got the big 'ol
"please don't sue us" promotion.

06:44.766 --> 06:47.268
Also known as the non-promotion
promotion.

06:47.302 --> 06:48.903
Ding-ding.
Fuck!

06:48.937 --> 06:50.404
I like her.
She seems dynamic.

06:50.439 --> 06:52.540
You're a big idiot.

06:52.574 --> 06:54.575
- Marty, that night...
<i>- You know how to running man?</i>

06:54.609 --> 06:56.377
<i>You know how to running man.</i>

06:56.411 --> 06:58.012
You, you did the running man.

07:00.215 --> 07:02.750
See it?

07:02.784 --> 07:04.385
Absolutely, absolutely.

07:04.419 --> 07:06.854
Go, Marty. Go, Marty.

07:07.989 --> 07:09.957
Mm, no, you did

07:09.991 --> 07:11.225
the running man.

07:11.259 --> 07:13.227
I don't know how to do the running man.

07:13.261 --> 07:15.362
<i>Jeannie, do the running man.</i>

07:17.098 --> 07:18.432
<i>Yeah, I know that now.</i>

07:18.467 --> 07:20.801
What else, Marty?

07:20.836 --> 07:22.403
Oh, my God, Marty, what else?

07:22.437 --> 07:24.438
Marty, you and your pod have
a 9:45 conference call

07:24.473 --> 07:25.706
with Mr. Pincus.

07:25.740 --> 07:27.908
Thanks. Who set up Pincus?

07:27.943 --> 07:29.410
Don't look at me.
I don't...

07:29.444 --> 07:31.345
- What do you mean?
- Okay. Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it.

07:31.379 --> 07:33.113
- Are you guys fucking kidding me?
- I don't have pinc...

07:33.148 --> 07:34.482
See? There! You see?

07:34.516 --> 07:36.650
The new galweather stearn
off to save the day.

07:36.685 --> 07:37.985
You go get 'em, sister.

07:39.187 --> 07:41.121
Marty,

07:41.156 --> 07:43.390
You know that
we're hemorrhaging business

07:43.425 --> 07:46.227
- with the big guys leaving, right?
- Mm.

07:46.261 --> 07:48.929
You're the new Jesus Christ,
and I am counting on you

07:48.964 --> 07:50.130
to close like a motherfucker.

07:50.165 --> 07:51.832
Yeah, well, I can do that,
Ms. hofschraeger.

07:51.867 --> 07:53.901
Oh, come on.
You're kidding, right?

07:53.935 --> 07:55.603
It's julianne.
Julianne.

07:55.637 --> 07:57.004
What was I thinking? Oh!

07:57.038 --> 07:58.606
Okay okay.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.708
A little extra bonus.

08:01.877 --> 08:03.244
Who the fuck is Pincus?

08:03.278 --> 08:05.513
Tell me that somebody has some notes.

08:05.547 --> 08:06.780
Who the fuck is Pincus?

08:06.815 --> 08:08.582
I have no idea, Marty.
I swear to you, I don't know.

08:08.617 --> 08:10.518
He's not mine. I've never heard
the name Pincus before in my life.

08:10.552 --> 08:12.119
Me either. And he's not on our
client docket at all.

08:12.153 --> 08:12.987
Google the fuck out
of this motherfucker.

08:12.988 --> 08:13.821
I'm doing it now.

08:13.855 --> 08:15.422
Jeannie, are you sure
you didn't set this?

08:15.457 --> 08:18.025
No. I have been on
a bullshit vacation, remember?

08:18.059 --> 08:19.693
Great. I have 65 Pincuses in

08:19.728 --> 08:22.363
leadership positions in the U.S.
did his area code come up?

08:22.397 --> 08:24.098
It's a blocked number.
He's on the phone right now.

08:24.132 --> 08:27.635
- This second, he's on.
- We gotta take the call. We can't...

08:27.669 --> 08:29.136
Okay, shock and awe. Doug,

08:29.170 --> 08:31.038
start a goddamned database
right now. Go.

08:31.072 --> 08:32.773
Here we go.

08:32.807 --> 08:34.275
Hello. Am I speaking
with Mr. Pincus?

08:34.308 --> 08:35.775
This is Pincus.

08:35.809 --> 08:38.111
Yes, sir, we'd really like to
thank you for taking this call.

08:38.145 --> 08:40.080
Should we call you
"Mr. Pincus,"

08:40.115 --> 08:42.015
or would you prefer...?

08:42.049 --> 08:45.286
Who am I talking to? Is this
the group from galweather?

08:45.320 --> 08:46.687
Yes, it is, sir.

08:46.721 --> 08:49.356
Call was supposed to start
five minutes ago.

08:49.391 --> 08:50.357
Exactly.
So let's dig right in.

08:50.392 --> 08:52.126
We wanted to get your point of view

08:52.160 --> 08:53.761
on the deliverables, um,

08:53.795 --> 08:56.030
and both the scope
of the short-term work

08:56.064 --> 08:59.533
and, uh, the endgame scenarios.

08:59.568 --> 09:01.235
Uh-huh.
And, sir, I had

09:01.269 --> 09:03.537
a quick question--
how is the weather...

09:03.572 --> 09:04.705
Over there?

09:04.739 --> 09:08.008
It's fine. Go on.

09:08.043 --> 09:09.577
Uh, we always want to make sure

09:09.611 --> 09:11.645
that our journeyline is, uh, on track.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.213
So, what do you think?

09:13.248 --> 09:14.248
What do you we think...

09:15.250 --> 09:17.618
is a very direct way to begin.

09:17.652 --> 09:20.187
So let's just start there.

09:20.221 --> 09:22.423
Thank jumping Jesus you're
not charging me for this

09:22.457 --> 09:25.025
initial consult or you'd be
hearing a goddamn dial tone.

09:25.060 --> 09:27.895
And we would deserve to hear
that djal tone, sir, but, uh,

09:27.929 --> 09:30.030
let's just step back
and admire the problem

09:30.065 --> 09:33.067
as it were, um, because we want
to make sure we're aligned,

09:33.101 --> 09:35.336
and that there's no disconnect
at the end of the day,

09:35.370 --> 09:37.237
we're trying to get
an idea of what it is

09:37.272 --> 09:38.939
you're expecting
to get out of this engagement--

09:38.974 --> 09:40.841
net-net, uh,
end state vision.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.510
I already discussed that
with the first guy.

09:43.545 --> 09:45.646
So, why would you bother
sharing it with us?

09:45.680 --> 09:46.981
Understood.

09:47.015 --> 09:49.083
- Sir, this is what I'm thinking...
- Stochasticity.

09:49.117 --> 09:50.985
What?

09:51.019 --> 09:52.853
Stochasticity, sir.

09:52.887 --> 09:54.321
Randomness, entropy.

09:54.356 --> 09:57.024
Uh, the second law--
as my chaos theory Professor

09:57.058 --> 09:59.059
at Harvard would call it.

09:59.094 --> 10:00.995
You know, really it
governs our whole lives.

10:01.029 --> 10:04.932
Uh, the beautiful chaotic,
utterly unpredictable world

10:04.966 --> 10:09.069
that we inhabit,
all that we can rely on, sir,

10:09.104 --> 10:12.072
is a random series of zeros and ones...

10:12.107 --> 10:13.207
I thought this meeting was...

10:13.241 --> 10:15.709
Try to stay with me, Mr. p.

10:15.744 --> 10:18.412
This stuff isn't easy, but
the one and only thing

10:18.446 --> 10:22.349
that we can truly count on
in this random universe

10:22.384 --> 10:25.019
is that occasionally that randomness

10:25.053 --> 10:27.788
can present itself as, well, fate.

10:27.822 --> 10:29.456
What is your name, son?

10:29.491 --> 10:32.459
Uh, Guggenheim, sir.

10:32.494 --> 10:34.628
Uh, Guggenheim with a g.

10:36.064 --> 10:37.031
Mr. G.

10:37.065 --> 10:38.465
Uh, yes, sir.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.801
I want you to shut the fuck up
for the remainder of this call.

10:40.835 --> 10:42.102
Yes, sir.

10:42.137 --> 10:45.673
Uh, listen, Mr. Pincus,
you sound like you're

10:45.707 --> 10:47.474
a no-bullshit kind of a guy
to me-- is that right?

10:47.509 --> 10:49.543
Yeah, with a very strong
bullshit detector.

10:49.577 --> 10:50.811
And you probably can tell
we're dancing around

10:50.845 --> 10:51.979
quite a bit right now.

10:52.013 --> 10:53.147
You're like Jennifer grey, son.

10:53.181 --> 10:55.115
All right, what Doug Guggenheim

10:55.150 --> 10:56.717
just said to you is absolute bullshit.

10:56.751 --> 10:59.720
Because as much as we've
been working and thinking

10:59.754 --> 11:02.156
and crunching these numbers,

11:02.190 --> 11:03.624
we really need to sit down with you

11:03.658 --> 11:06.160
and get a 360 vision of the horizon

11:06.194 --> 11:09.296
from where you sit, sir.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.365
People are more than just a random set

11:11.399 --> 11:12.433
of numbers, all right?

11:12.467 --> 11:13.634
We are flesh and blood.

11:14.803 --> 11:16.503
And until we can look you in the eye,

11:16.538 --> 11:17.638
and you can look us in the eye

11:17.672 --> 11:19.973
and find out what
kind of people we are,

11:20.008 --> 11:21.675
it's all bullshit.

11:21.710 --> 11:24.178
That's the first thing anyone's
said that makes sense.

11:24.212 --> 11:26.113
All right, fantastic.

11:26.147 --> 11:28.182
So, listen, why don't we
just fly out and, uh...

11:28.216 --> 11:29.016
We could also drive.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.250
Easily take a train

11:30.285 --> 11:31.285
or something like that.
Boat.

11:31.319 --> 11:32.986
Probably won't take a boat.

11:33.021 --> 11:34.955
Probably not gonna be a boat, sir.

11:34.989 --> 11:36.957
Mr. Pincus?

11:36.991 --> 11:39.793
I'll be in L.A.
tomorrow morning.

11:39.828 --> 11:42.996
You people need to deliver
something I can understand.

11:44.332 --> 11:45.833
Okay.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.601
You guys think you can find out
who this motherfucker is?

11:47.635 --> 11:49.169
- Yeah.
- Hey, Doug?

11:49.204 --> 11:50.337
- Mm-hmm?
- You want to have

11:50.371 --> 11:51.839
- a chat with me in my office?
- Sure.

11:51.873 --> 11:54.675
Doug, can I just say that was
fantastic, wonderful work.

11:54.709 --> 11:56.176
You really took it out there.

11:56.211 --> 11:57.945
Mr. G.

12:01.983 --> 12:03.217
Do you want to smell?

12:03.251 --> 12:05.152
Don't do that!

12:07.055 --> 12:08.388
A little harder then.

12:08.423 --> 12:09.723
Don't be a bitch, hit me harder.

12:10.859 --> 12:12.459
Oh, shit.

12:12.494 --> 12:13.794
Oh, fuck.

12:13.828 --> 12:14.728
You broke my face.

12:14.763 --> 12:17.498
Whoa, wow...
Look.

12:17.532 --> 12:19.056
- You don't punch like a bitch.
- <i>Jeannie. Jeannie.</i>

12:19.067 --> 12:20.567
Hey, Jeannie?
What?

12:20.602 --> 12:23.303
What the hell happened to you?

12:23.338 --> 12:24.905
Nothing. I don't know.

12:24.939 --> 12:27.274
Do you remember when I was
the one everyone thought was

12:27.308 --> 12:29.042
on the zipline to partner?

12:29.077 --> 12:31.011
That was fun.
I think people still do.

12:31.045 --> 12:32.746
I doubt it, but

12:32.781 --> 12:35.315
it's just a lot more complicated now.

12:35.350 --> 12:36.483
Maybe.

12:36.518 --> 12:37.718
I think you'll be fine.

12:37.752 --> 12:40.254
At least now you can fuck
anybody you want, right?

12:40.288 --> 12:42.956
Got rid of that stupid fiancé--
you can do anything you want.

12:44.526 --> 12:46.560
Yeah, I guess that's true.

12:46.594 --> 12:47.995
Like Marty, you could fuck Marty again.

12:48.029 --> 12:49.530
Jesus Christ, Clyde.

12:49.564 --> 12:51.265
Can you not maintain
the illusion of niceness

12:51.299 --> 12:52.833
for like longer than 60 seconds?

12:52.867 --> 12:55.335
I usually Max out around 40.

12:55.370 --> 12:58.005
So... but did you
fuck him though?

12:58.039 --> 12:59.273
Oh, come on, dad.

12:59.307 --> 13:01.408
Roscoe, I'm not saying
that your mom's place

13:01.442 --> 13:02.743
is not a good place for you to be.

13:02.777 --> 13:04.278
Oh, no, you'd never say that.

13:04.312 --> 13:05.245
What I'm saying is I think...

13:05.280 --> 13:06.213
Dad, I know what you're saying.

13:06.247 --> 13:07.514
How do you know what I'm saying?

13:07.549 --> 13:09.016
- You...
- You won't even let me finish a sentence.

13:09.050 --> 13:10.492
You think your house is
a better place for me to be,

13:10.518 --> 13:11.885
but you keep not
showing up for me, dad.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.021
Not showing up? Are we not
sitting here right now?

13:14.055 --> 13:15.455
Dad, seriously?
Listen, Roscoe.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.623
I was distracted, buddy.

13:16.658 --> 13:17.591
I'm sorry.
I'm a kid.

13:17.625 --> 13:18.759
I already apologized for that.

13:18.793 --> 13:20.160
I'm a kid, dad--
I shouldn't have

13:20.195 --> 13:22.963
to be the one to figure
all this out or make a rational

13:22.997 --> 13:24.798
decision based on my findings.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.567
That should be my parents' job.

13:26.601 --> 13:28.168
Uh, it is your parents' job.

13:28.203 --> 13:30.003
And as your parent, I feel...
Dad, it's

13:30.038 --> 13:31.572
not about what you feel...

13:31.606 --> 13:32.506
Really?
I got to do

13:32.540 --> 13:34.107
what I got to do-- my life.

13:34.142 --> 13:36.276
Keep your voice down--
don't disrespect me.

13:36.311 --> 13:39.513
Hello, I hear we have a
carpenters fan at the table.

13:39.547 --> 13:40.814
It's not a good time. No.

13:40.849 --> 13:41.949
Absolutely not.

13:41.983 --> 13:42.816
Buzz off.

13:42.851 --> 13:44.151
Fuck.

13:44.185 --> 13:46.386
Could you just go with it, please?

13:46.421 --> 13:48.555
I'm right on the bubble at this job,

13:48.590 --> 13:50.123
and my manager is, um,

13:50.158 --> 13:52.826
over there.

13:52.861 --> 13:53.711
Your manager looks like
escaped from a mental ward.

13:53.712 --> 13:54.561
Dad,

13:54.596 --> 13:55.829
just... it's-it's fine.

13:55.864 --> 13:56.964
She's on the bubble.

13:56.998 --> 13:57.965

Hi, you must be Marty!

Yeah, hi...
Hi, hi!

15:23.451 --> 15:24.918
Hi, hi.

15:24.953 --> 15:26.219
Tessa, did you make tempeh?

15:26.254 --> 15:28.221
Hells yeah, sister.
Awesome.

15:28.256 --> 15:30.090
I think you guys might
be in bedtime trouble.

15:30.124 --> 15:31.758
Seriously?
Yeah.

15:31.793 --> 15:34.761
Don't worry, I think madame
will let it slide this once.

15:34.796 --> 15:36.263
Are you leaving?
Yeah.

15:36.297 --> 15:37.764
Oh, hello, gentlepersons.

15:37.799 --> 15:39.132
Hey, mom.
Hey.

15:39.167 --> 15:41.134
I put the tempeh in the fridge
and the quinoa's

15:41.169 --> 15:43.437
still cooling, so if you'll put
it away before you go to bed.

15:43.471 --> 15:45.439
Okay, yeah, thank you.

15:45.473 --> 15:46.673
Later, dude.

15:46.708 --> 15:47.841
So great to meet you, Marty.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.009
Uh, yes.

15:49.043 --> 15:50.477
You, too.

15:50.511 --> 15:51.645
Here's the deal.

15:51.679 --> 15:53.714
I will not get mad if you go straight

15:53.748 --> 15:55.082
to your room, you read for ten minutes.

15:55.116 --> 15:56.550
Ooh, I'm terrified.

15:56.584 --> 15:57.851
Hey.
Ooh.

16:01.122 --> 16:02.889
You had her sing that
carpenters song, didn't you?

16:02.924 --> 16:05.859
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:05.893 --> 16:07.294
Night, daddy.
Good night.

16:07.328 --> 16:08.562
Night, mom.
Night, baby.

16:11.299 --> 16:13.734
So, hey, Monica.

16:13.768 --> 16:15.802
Hey, Marty.

16:15.837 --> 16:17.237
Okay, what the fuck?

16:17.271 --> 16:18.705
What?

16:18.740 --> 16:20.774
Wh-what... What the fuck
is all of this?

16:20.808 --> 16:23.410
You know, you got
your cute little vegan chef,

16:23.444 --> 16:26.680
and you're all domestic and...

16:26.714 --> 16:29.249
Homey and stay-at-home-mommy-y.

16:29.283 --> 16:30.417
Mm.

16:30.451 --> 16:33.420
I mean, come on,
this isn't you, Monica.

16:33.454 --> 16:35.655
Really, Marty, so you know me
better than I know myself?

16:35.690 --> 16:37.057
Is that... is that what it is?

16:37.091 --> 16:39.993
No, I think we both know Monica
pretty well by now, right?

16:40.028 --> 16:41.228
You know what, let's not.

16:41.262 --> 16:43.663
We just go round and round--
let's just not do it.

16:43.698 --> 16:46.233
I shared about this exact thing

16:46.267 --> 16:47.567
at my meeting last night.

16:47.602 --> 16:49.469
You shared about me
at your 12 step meeting?

16:49.504 --> 16:51.004
That is so awesome.
Yeah.

16:51.039 --> 16:53.940
Yeah, it's okay, I mean, that's
why they call it "anonymous."

16:53.975 --> 16:55.142
No, I'm not worried about that,

16:55.176 --> 16:58.478
I just, uh... I just don't know

16:58.513 --> 17:00.847
what's really going on, I mean,

17:00.882 --> 17:03.817
is this some sort
of a legal custody grab?

17:03.851 --> 17:05.819
He's already here, Marty.

17:10.724 --> 17:13.093
Then what the fuck is
really going on, Monica?

17:14.862 --> 17:17.897
Maybe it seems impossible
to believe but people grow,

17:17.932 --> 17:19.965
and then they change and
that's what's happening to me.

17:20.001 --> 17:21.635
Oh.

17:21.669 --> 17:23.336
I'm not angling for anything.

17:23.371 --> 17:24.704
I'm not trying to win you back.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.441
I'm moving forward, I'm happy.

17:27.474 --> 17:29.376
I wish you could move forward, too.

17:29.410 --> 17:32.079
Mm-hmm.

17:32.113 --> 17:34.014
Marty, I love you.

17:34.048 --> 17:35.215
Oh, I love you, too.

17:35.249 --> 17:37.751
And I want... I just...

17:40.555 --> 17:43.723
No, I don't... we should
definitely not do anything.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.192
This is not...
Let's do this.

17:45.226 --> 17:47.561
No, I don't...

17:47.595 --> 17:48.962
Oh, fuck.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.201
Oh, God.

17:54.235 --> 17:55.969
Mm.
Oh...

17:57.238 --> 17:59.706
We should not...
We should...

17:59.740 --> 18:00.740
No, no. No.

18:00.775 --> 18:01.675
What? Wh-what? What are...

18:01.709 --> 18:03.143
We should not.
What do you mean?

18:03.177 --> 18:04.878
We're already doing it,
what are you talking about?

18:04.912 --> 18:06.379
We're not... no. Maybe
if it was last night,

18:06.414 --> 18:07.581
when I was unbearably horny...

18:07.615 --> 18:09.216
- You were unbearably horny last night?
- No...

18:09.250 --> 18:10.817
- You should've called me.
- That's not what I'm saying.

18:10.852 --> 18:11.852
Listen to me. Go.
Monica.

18:11.886 --> 18:12.886
You gotta go.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.321
- Be fucking serious...
- You gotta go.

18:14.355 --> 18:15.322
I am serious.

18:15.356 --> 18:16.656
Monica, stop fucking around.

18:16.691 --> 18:18.158
Come on...
Marty. Stop.

18:19.193 --> 18:20.594
Monica...

18:20.628 --> 18:21.795
Monica.

This is Luna.

19:00.067 --> 19:01.735
Hey, Marty.
Hey, Luna.

19:01.769 --> 19:03.403
I can't believe I'm actually
getting to meet you.

19:03.437 --> 19:05.238
Uh... me, too.

19:05.273 --> 19:06.606
Oh, and this...

19:06.641 --> 19:08.542
This is Jo.

19:08.576 --> 19:09.743
Hi, Jo.
Hi, Marty.

19:09.777 --> 19:11.378
Oh, hi.

19:11.412 --> 19:12.913
Two, three, give him four.

19:12.947 --> 19:14.714
Oh! Baroom!

19:14.749 --> 19:16.650
Clyde was right about you.

19:16.684 --> 19:17.651
He was?

19:17.685 --> 19:19.486
Mm-hmm, totally.
Totally.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.820
So, um, what's...

19:20.855 --> 19:21.855
When you called me...
Yeah?

19:21.889 --> 19:23.190
I was with my girls, so I figured

19:23.224 --> 19:24.257
- why not bring 'em over...
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:24.292 --> 19:26.493
"Your girls"?
Oh, my goodness, yes.

19:26.527 --> 19:28.428
Oh, I must not have
told you. We all date.

19:28.462 --> 19:30.430
We're like a couple,
but there's three of us.

19:30.464 --> 19:31.898
Oh, that's really well put,

19:31.933 --> 19:33.400
- baby.
- Totally.

19:33.434 --> 19:36.570
Wow. So you're in a committed
relationship with two women.

19:36.604 --> 19:37.571
I mean...

19:37.605 --> 19:38.505
Yeah.
Yes?

19:38.539 --> 19:39.406
Yeah.
Right?

19:39.440 --> 19:40.807
Like, for example, Marty,

19:40.841 --> 19:41.775
if, um,

19:41.809 --> 19:43.476
you know, me and you wanted to...

19:43.511 --> 19:44.978
Oh, well, why wouldn't we?

19:45.012 --> 19:46.246
Exactly.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.247
Uh...

19:47.281 --> 19:48.815
I don't mean to be a stickler,

19:48.849 --> 19:51.151
because it sounds awesome...
It is awesome.

19:51.185 --> 19:52.619
- It's awesome.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

19:54.088 --> 19:56.323
But why go through the trouble
of calling it a relationship

19:56.357 --> 19:58.091
if you guys are with each other

19:58.125 --> 19:59.192
but you're also with

19:59.227 --> 20:00.527
whoever?

20:00.561 --> 20:01.695
Hmm.

20:01.729 --> 20:02.696
Oh...

20:02.730 --> 20:03.830
No idea.

20:03.864 --> 20:04.798
I don't know.

20:04.832 --> 20:05.865
Don't even think about...

20:05.900 --> 20:06.766
I think you're getting off track.

20:06.801 --> 20:07.867
What Luna was trying to say

20:07.902 --> 20:10.003
is if you guys ever wanted to fuck...

20:10.037 --> 20:11.471
Yeah... Fucking go for it, man.

20:11.505 --> 20:12.639
But that would then

20:12.673 --> 20:14.207
put me in kind of
a relationship with you,

20:14.242 --> 20:15.408
right?

20:15.443 --> 20:17.277
Uh...

20:17.311 --> 20:18.545
- I guess kind of.
- Yeah.

20:18.579 --> 20:19.679
Oh, my God, baby.

20:19.714 --> 20:20.847
You were right.

20:20.881 --> 20:22.148
He is super smart.

20:22.183 --> 20:23.783
Oop, guess what I just figured out?

20:23.818 --> 20:25.051
What?
Reached my boundary.

20:25.086 --> 20:26.853
Wait, which is what?
Oh, any scenario

20:26.887 --> 20:30.023
that involves me potentially
waking up in bed next to Clyde.

20:31.359 --> 20:32.325
Haven't said no yet.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.526
Oh. No yet.

20:33.561 --> 20:34.527
Oh...

20:34.562 --> 20:35.528
It's your loss.

20:35.563 --> 20:37.397
Bourbon.
You pick it.

20:37.431 --> 20:39.165
Um, wait.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.333
So are we still in a
committed relationship?

20:40.368 --> 20:41.568
Yes, yes.
Like, us three are committed.

20:41.602 --> 20:43.169
One hundred percent.

20:43.204 --> 20:44.738
- That's not what he said.
- He doesn't understand.

20:44.772 --> 20:45.739
I don't even get what he said.

20:45.773 --> 20:47.073
When do I get to fuck Jo?

20:47.108 --> 20:48.708
Wait, you guys can fuck
each other anytime.

20:48.743 --> 20:49.843
? I've got time.

20:52.113 --> 20:54.080
Uh, well, oh, hey!

20:54.115 --> 20:55.382
Thanks for joining us,
Mr. Guggenheim.

20:55.416 --> 20:56.583
- Slippers?
- Yeah.

20:56.617 --> 20:57.717
Pulled an all-nighter, Marty.

20:57.752 --> 20:59.486
People need to know.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.421
Okay, so, here's what

21:01.455 --> 21:02.555
we found out.

21:02.590 --> 21:04.824
A whole bunch about our friend Pincus.

21:04.859 --> 21:07.527
We know he's obviously threatened
by Harvard-educated men.

21:07.561 --> 21:09.929
- Fuckin' drop it, Doug.
- What? It might help us forensically.

21:09.964 --> 21:11.765
- It's not gonna help us in any way.
- We don't know that yet.

21:11.799 --> 21:14.000
Are you saying you still don't know

21:14.035 --> 21:15.235
who Pincus is?

21:15.269 --> 21:16.569
Problem is, he's not
in the system, okay?

21:16.604 --> 21:18.338
So any partner or consultant who made

21:18.372 --> 21:19.873
the initial contact
didn't provide any record of it.

21:19.907 --> 21:21.174
I'm sure that when you Google the man,

21:21.208 --> 21:22.175
something comes up, right, Doug?

21:22.209 --> 21:23.410
You do get something.
All right.

21:23.444 --> 21:26.046
So Mr. Ivy-league-hating Pincus

21:26.080 --> 21:27.847
is either an elusive shipping magnate,

21:27.882 --> 21:29.182
a video game software ceo,

21:29.216 --> 21:32.052
an innovator in
fire-retardant sleepwear,

21:32.086 --> 21:33.720
a third-tier casino owner,

21:33.754 --> 21:34.921
or a vodka distiller.

21:34.955 --> 21:37.090
Yeah, uh, and only two
of those have photographs.

21:37.124 --> 21:38.758
Five fucking names.
You don't know shit, Doug.

21:38.793 --> 21:39.959
- I wouldn't say that.
- No, you don't know shit.

21:39.994 --> 21:41.394
That's as narrowed down
as you got the list?

21:41.429 --> 21:43.530
So how much of that all-nighter
did you spend just sleeping?

21:43.564 --> 21:45.398
Well, I'm a wreck without
at least seven hours.

21:45.433 --> 21:46.866
Okay, so that's
not an all-nighter.

21:46.901 --> 21:48.568
- You got a full night's sleep.
- Except I was here all night.

21:48.602 --> 21:49.969
That's not the way an
all-nighter works, okay?

21:50.004 --> 21:51.204
Marty.

21:51.238 --> 21:53.807
Did we do... some
sort of exercise?

21:53.841 --> 21:55.675
No. Definitely not.

21:55.710 --> 21:57.410
I think we did.

21:57.445 --> 22:00.313
In fact, I'm almost
positive that we did.

22:00.348 --> 22:01.748
Wait a minute.

22:01.782 --> 22:03.783
Did I do a shitload
of push-ups?

22:16.831 --> 22:18.131
Oh...

22:18.165 --> 22:19.466
I remember that.
Yeah.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.600
Mr. Pincus is here.

22:20.634 --> 22:21.868
What... what are
you talking about?

22:21.902 --> 22:23.002
- Here, now?
- Now.

22:23.037 --> 22:24.070
Wait, what does he look like?

22:24.105 --> 22:26.473
Uh, like... oldish.

22:26.507 --> 22:27.640
That doesn't... hold on.

22:27.675 --> 22:28.954
Did he say anything about me?
Shah Guggenheim.

22:28.976 --> 22:30.310
- Fuck off, Doug.
- Just-just tell him...

22:30.344 --> 22:31.845
- Just tell him we're on our way, okay?
- All right, all right.

22:31.879 --> 22:33.446
What do we do?

22:33.481 --> 22:34.781
Well, we're not gonna panic.

22:34.815 --> 22:36.850
- I disagree; I think we should panic.
- We should panic.

22:36.884 --> 22:38.084
Yes.
All right.

22:39.553 --> 22:41.388
Here you are, sir.

22:41.422 --> 22:43.790
Mr. Pincus.

22:45.693 --> 22:48.528
So good to finally meet
you in the flesh, sir.

22:48.562 --> 22:49.529
That's quite a grip.

22:49.563 --> 22:51.631
Uh-huh. Yeah.

22:51.665 --> 22:52.699
Uh, sorry I'm late.

22:52.733 --> 22:54.267
I was on the phone with the Chinese.

22:54.301 --> 22:55.602
You know how they can yammer on.

22:55.636 --> 22:57.170
Uh... anyway,

22:57.204 --> 22:58.638
I'm sure the team's already titr'd you,

22:58.672 --> 23:00.273
so I'm just gonna jump right in.

23:00.307 --> 23:02.041
Um, in your
industry--

23:02.076 --> 23:03.376
well, in any
industry, really--

23:03.411 --> 23:06.379
uh... environmentals
can disrupt bau--

23:06.414 --> 23:09.849
business as usual--
and we just wanted to, you know,

23:09.884 --> 23:11.818
get your take on these, moving forward.

23:11.852 --> 23:14.154
That's why I'm talking to you.

23:14.188 --> 23:16.489
Well, of course that's
why you're talking to us.

23:16.524 --> 23:18.958
- Of course.
- No, of cour.

23:18.993 --> 23:21.294
We were just wondering
if we could get an idea

23:21.328 --> 23:23.196
of your data point.
Have a seat.

23:23.230 --> 23:24.831
Please. Please.

23:24.865 --> 23:26.032
Thank you.

23:29.670 --> 23:30.837
Mr. Pincus, we know.

23:30.871 --> 23:33.373
We know about everything.
All of it.

23:33.407 --> 23:34.841
We know you're under siege, sir.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.509
Your technology is outmoded.

23:36.544 --> 23:37.510
It's ancient.

23:37.545 --> 23:39.446
I know. I... I know.

23:39.480 --> 23:40.947
The sad truth, sir,

23:40.981 --> 23:41.848
is that you're losing touch.

23:41.882 --> 23:43.850
You're affected by international

23:43.884 --> 23:44.891
banking failures.
You're telling me?

23:44.919 --> 23:45.952
You're not sleeping.

23:45.986 --> 23:46.886
You're desperate.

23:47.855 --> 23:48.888
Mm.

23:52.927 --> 23:53.893
You're right.

23:53.928 --> 23:55.995
I am.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.202
We know that you've even considered...

24:02.236 --> 24:04.204
- God, I don't even want to say it.
- Don't, then.

24:04.238 --> 24:05.505
Don't do it.
No.

24:05.539 --> 24:07.407
Well, I'm ashamed to say, yes, I have.

24:08.442 --> 24:10.176
The whole thing...

24:10.211 --> 24:11.644
Oh, it's-it's slipping away.

24:11.679 --> 24:12.846
But we got your back, sir.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.080
You can take a breath, friend...

24:14.114 --> 24:15.982
For the first time in years.

24:16.016 --> 24:17.484
We are going to take your business

24:17.518 --> 24:18.718
back to heights you never thought

24:18.752 --> 24:20.320
were possible, and then beyond.

24:20.354 --> 24:23.056
To a new paradigm, a new reality,

24:23.090 --> 24:24.691
a new place where your friends,

24:24.725 --> 24:26.559
your-your family,

24:26.594 --> 24:28.228
your employees...

24:28.262 --> 24:29.429
They're gonna see a new Pincus.

24:29.463 --> 24:30.830
A new Pincus?

24:30.865 --> 24:32.499
Forgive me, sir.

24:32.533 --> 24:33.566
A "now" Pincus.

24:33.601 --> 24:35.435
I like the sound of that.

24:35.469 --> 24:36.669
A now Pincus.

24:36.704 --> 24:38.071
A better, more hopeful Pincus.

24:38.105 --> 24:40.340
A Pincus who once again has
the world by the fuckin' balls.

24:40.374 --> 24:42.041
Yes, goddamn it, yes.

24:42.076 --> 24:43.376
That's the spirit!
Okay.

24:43.410 --> 24:44.544
So now that you've heard all this,

24:44.578 --> 24:45.678
what are we gonna do together?

24:45.713 --> 24:46.946
I think that's pretty obvious.

24:46.981 --> 24:48.181
Well...
No.

24:48.215 --> 24:49.415
- Say it anyway.
- You gotta say it, though, right?

24:49.450 --> 24:50.950
- It'll be fine.
- Let's go, come on.

24:50.985 --> 24:52.719
Obvious is obvious, but don't
you want to put it out there?

24:52.753 --> 24:54.387
Just-just say it.

24:54.421 --> 24:56.256
Because we all love shipping.

24:56.290 --> 24:57.190
- Right? Or...
- What?

24:57.224 --> 24:58.091
Or pajamas. Pajamas?

24:58.125 --> 25:00.059
And it is...

25:00.094 --> 25:01.528
Gotta say it out loud.

25:01.562 --> 25:03.363
Let's go, baby.

25:03.397 --> 25:05.598
We're gonna build
a better goddamn casino.

25:05.633 --> 25:08.201
Casino!
You're goddamn right!

25:08.235 --> 25:09.235
We're gonna build a better

25:09.270 --> 25:10.436
casino.
Casino!

25:15.943 --> 25:17.010
Marty...

25:17.044 --> 25:19.078
Marty.

25:19.113 --> 25:20.747
Now that you've got
them thinking about it,

25:20.781 --> 25:22.715
I'm afraid they're going
to break up with me.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.418
<i>Excusez-moi,</i>
<i>mesdemoiselles.</i>

25:25.452 --> 25:27.887
And then there was <i>trois.</i>

25:28.923 --> 25:30.823
You know, Clyde was,
uh, telling me that

25:30.858 --> 25:32.392
you're all in an open relationship.

25:32.426 --> 25:36.829
That you could, essentially,
have a <i>menagé a Gugg, oui?</i>

25:36.864 --> 25:38.097
No.

25:38.132 --> 25:39.098
Oh, no.

25:41.168 --> 25:42.669
Clyde, they like you so much

25:42.703 --> 25:45.605
they can even resist Doug
Guggenheim speaking French.

25:45.639 --> 25:46.906
One of his better moves.

25:46.941 --> 25:48.508
Jeannie, put down the water and t

25:48.542 --> 25:49.542

25:51.011 --> 25:53.146
Because we're going
to fucking Vegas, baby!

25:53.180 --> 25:55.448
