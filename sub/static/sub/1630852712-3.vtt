WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:31.640
THUNDER RUMBLES

00:42.440 --> 00:45.800
Constance! Mrs Ainsworth
says you're to come to the outhouse.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.720
Bring a basin of hot water with you.
And towels!

00:48.720 --> 00:52.080
Billy, what's happened? Billy!

00:57.760 --> 00:59.680
SHOUTING

01:16.440 --> 01:18.000
Hurry!

01:18.000 --> 01:20.080
SCREAMING

01:21.560 --> 01:23.800
Lucian.
Anish!

01:23.800 --> 01:25.160
Yes!
Is that you?

01:25.160 --> 01:27.520
Yes!
Oh, thank goodness.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.000
What a relief.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.120
I don't think he's doing very well.

01:32.120 --> 01:35.520
I need to stop the bleeding.
Constance, pass me the towels.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.960
SHOUTING

01:37.960 --> 01:40.240
HE YELLS

01:40.240 --> 01:43.000
Lucian. Lucian, Lucian!

01:43.000 --> 01:47.160
Amore mio. Ehi, ehi.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.760
E' la tempesta. Shh.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.520
KNOCKING

02:21.720 --> 02:24.120
How is he?

02:25.760 --> 02:30.400
He's stable, but weak.
He's lost a good deal of blood.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.600
Do you think he'll be all right?

02:32.600 --> 02:36.520
He's young and strong. Although I
suspect his sight might be damaged.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.680
Billy! Who are those men?

02:41.680 --> 02:44.600
I think it's best I don't make
any introductions, Mrs Ainsworth.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.280
HE GROANS
Be careful with him.

03:09.160 --> 03:12.440
He must see a doctor, please.
Tell them it's essential.

03:12.440 --> 03:16.480
Dice che devi portarlo
da un dottore E importante.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.400
Billy!

03:21.120 --> 03:24.120
Billy, come along.
You need to go and get cleaned up.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.200
And, Constance,
could you get dressed, please?

03:27.200 --> 03:29.280
I'd like to see you both
in my office afterwards.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.480
You have a lot of explaining to do,
young man.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.560
Has he said anything else?
About how the boy got injured?

03:41.560 --> 03:44.640
Only what I told you.
That it was Mussolini's thugs.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.800
In this sleepy little town
of all places.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.960
Nish, they're everywhere.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.760
Come along.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.640
I can't tell you
how sorry I am, Mrs Ainsworth.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.880
I've let you down.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.640
Billy, I know you did what you did
with the best of intentions.

04:12.640 --> 04:16.320
But it simply cannot happen again.
I promise it won't.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.480
We can't be seen to be taking sides,
do you understand?

04:21.200 --> 04:22.920
Right. You may go.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.360
Sorry, Mum.
I can't bear to look at you.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.040
I don't know what to say, ma'am.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.200
Betty, you don't need to say
anything. It's not your fault.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.880
His brothers used to give him a clip
around the ear when he stepped

04:45.880 --> 04:51.280
out of line, but now...
It's hard for me on my own, ma'am.

04:51.280 --> 04:54.880
I don't know how to handle
a lad of his age.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.400
Billy's a credit to you.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.960
He's just desperate for adventure,
that's all.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.800
Ma'am.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.680
Constance.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.200
I want to express
my gratitude to you.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.040
It was nothing, Mrs Ainsworth.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.480
If I might ask
for your discretion...

05:12.480 --> 05:15.600
You can trust me, ma'am.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.200
Is a tea party really a good idea?
Well, yes.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.080
It adds another string to our bow,
darling. Financially.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.720
But Betty's rushed off her feet.
I can manage, ma'am.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.680
You didn't manage very well
the other day.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.400
Alice!
I could lend a hand.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.200
I mean, I'm not in Betty's league,
but I could bake biscuits.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.400
Or even a bit of treacle pudding
at a push.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.880
I'm not sure the good townsfolk
of Portofino are ready

05:37.880 --> 05:41.200
for our treacle pudding,
but thank you, Constance.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.040
I'll take all the help I can get,
Conny, love.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.320
So, darling, will you take charge?
Yes, Mother.

05:46.320 --> 05:49.880
Thank you. And be sure to ask
Count Albani what we should serve.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.720
Is that really necessary?
Oh, yes.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.920
Yes, he was quite insistent
about being involved.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.600
I can't imagine his interest in
cake extends much beyond eating it.

05:57.600 --> 06:01.440
Well, perhaps it wasn't the cake
he was interested in.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.160
You should visit the Palazzo Bianco,
if you have time.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.680
It's got the most
extraordinary Caravaggio.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.640
I'm afraid we have
a lot of errands to run.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.000
And the Doge's palace.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.560
Certainly worth to have a look,
from the outside at least.

06:13.560 --> 06:19.120
What's a "doge"?
It's sort of like an elected king.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.640
Genoa had its own king?
It did.

06:21.640 --> 06:27.080
Genoa was the most feared republic
in the Mediterranean in its heyday.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.440
We even licensed
the Saint George's cross from them,

06:29.440 --> 06:31.760
to protect our ships.
Poppycock!

06:31.760 --> 06:34.960
Saint George is as English as...
tea in the afternoon.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.760
Old Joe Green even wrote an opera

06:36.760 --> 06:39.600
about one of Genoa's most famous
Doges, if memory serves.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.240
My husband keeps a box
at Convent Garden, Mr Ainsworth,

06:43.240 --> 06:46.320
and I can assure you
I've never heard of Joe Green.

06:46.320 --> 06:50.640
Young or old.
Giuseppe Verdi?

06:50.640 --> 06:52.920
Oh. A witticism.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.360
Andiamo.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.120
A rather feeble one, it would seem.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.080
Ah, Ainsworth.
Just the man I was looking for.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.360
I don't suppose you could organise
a ride for me?

07:06.360 --> 07:09.280
I could. Um... on a horse?

07:09.280 --> 07:10.920
Good grief, no. A bicycle.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.320
I was an infantry man,
not a donkey wallop.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.920
Oh. My mistake.

07:14.920 --> 07:16.600
I thought I might
take a training ride.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.440
Pump some power into the old leg
muscles for the battle ahead.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.600
Quite, quite. Well, um...

07:22.600 --> 07:25.720
I'm afraid we certainly
don't have any in the hotel.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.040
But you might commandeer one?

07:27.040 --> 07:29.520
I could certainly try.
Good man.

07:29.520 --> 07:34.440
Hello.
Should I be looking for a tandem?

07:36.280 --> 07:39.400
Lord, no. I could do with a couple
of hours out of the firing line.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.520
Sorry, my love. I'm coming.

07:50.080 --> 07:54.800
Ah! Hello.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.200
A little birdie told me
I might find you down here.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.360
In the doghouse, Master Lucian.
Never mind about all that.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.920
Um, do you know where I might be
able to get my hands on a bicycle?

08:06.520 --> 08:11.440
I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I do.
Besides, I'm a bit under the pump.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.280
Come on, Billy.
I'll make it worth your while.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.640
Maybe I do know someone.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.120
Good man.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.920
Hello, Mr Wingfield.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.240
I don't suppose there's
anything for me, is there?

08:57.240 --> 08:59.760
Ah. No, I'm afraid
I don't think there is.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.200
Are you expecting something?
A letter from home.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.600
All set.
Hello, Mrs Wingfield.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.640
Hello.
Good day.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.080
Oh, Luc, darling.
There's a letter for you.

09:14.080 --> 09:20.000
Oh, wonderful.
And one, two, three for your father.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Would you mind
giving them to him, darling?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.840
No. Not at all.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.200
You're not wearing your ring.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.760
Oh.

09:30.760 --> 09:35.400
Is everything all right?
Of course. Why do you ask?

09:35.400 --> 09:40.520
You weren't obliged to sell it?
What a vivid imagination you have.

09:40.520 --> 09:44.640
It's hot, my hands get swollen and
I didn't want the ring to get stuck.

09:47.160 --> 09:51.520
I suppose I just put two and two
together and made five.

09:51.520 --> 09:55.640
Yes, you did make five.
Stop worrying.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.000
I'll take these to Papa.

10:13.920 --> 10:17.600
This had better be good news.
Mama wanted me to give you these.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.200
HE SIGHS
Thank you.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.560
Don't let me keep you.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.720
Your Ladyship.
Oh, the post!

10:45.720 --> 10:48.320
Mrs Ainsworth, thank you so much.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.240
Your letters.
Thank you.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.840
The newspaper. And, darling,
there's one for you.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.560
For me?

10:56.400 --> 10:59.720
It's a local postmark.
Are you going to open it?

11:03.960 --> 11:07.560
It's from Lady Caroline!
What does she say?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.480
Ooh, Alice,
don't keep us in suspense.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.600
Right-o.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.080
"Dear Mrs Mays-Smith,
please forgive

11:15.080 --> 11:18.120
"my unpardonable rudeness
for not having written before now

11:18.120 --> 11:20.120
"to thank you for calling
at the Villa Franchesi

11:20.120 --> 11:23.360
"the week before last."
We don't need every word, darling.

11:29.360 --> 11:31.200
Her mother's inviting us
to a light supper.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.200
All of us?
You, dear Melissa. And your aunt.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.680
Mama, Papa, the Drummond-Wards
and Count Albani.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.240
Do I know these people?

11:38.240 --> 11:41.320
Lady Caroline is the
Earl of Harborne's daughter, Aunt.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.440
Oh, really?
The Countess looks forward

11:43.440 --> 11:47.080
to making your acquaintance,
your Ladyship.  I see.

11:47.080 --> 11:51.480
And when is this grand occasion?
The 21st.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.640
SHE GASPS
That's Thursday.

11:54.640 --> 11:58.080
Well, you better go and tell Betty.
Thank you, Mama.

12:00.960 --> 12:04.280
And decide what we're going to wear!
Yes!

12:08.240 --> 12:11.600
Oh! Count Albani.
Please.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.240
Is it you we have to thank
for all the excitement?

12:18.240 --> 12:20.360
What is the reason for it?

12:20.360 --> 12:22.720
Lady Caroline's
invited everyone for supper.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.600
Then it is surely Lady Caroline
you should be thanking.

12:25.600 --> 12:30.320
Well, whoever's behind it,
they've made someone very happy.

12:30.320 --> 12:33.360
Then I'm happy also.
Your letters.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.560
Is it far?

12:35.560 --> 12:38.000
Oh, it's just a short carriage ride
into the hills.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.160
I simply cannot be expected
to travel any sort of distance

12:41.160 --> 12:42.520
after dark.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.880
Perhaps I might be permitted
to ride with you, Lady Latchmere?

12:45.880 --> 12:48.640
And offer you
my personal protection.

12:48.640 --> 12:52.400
Oh, how kind, thank you so much.
Thank you.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.600
Am I safe to entrust myself
with him?

12:56.600 --> 12:59.040
I mean, you know what they say
about Italians.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.200
I'm not sure I do, Your Ladyship.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.320
Well, apparently they're notorious
for it, I've heard.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.000
Notorious for what exactly?

13:07.000 --> 13:10.040
Goodness gracious, do I have to
spell it out for you, Mrs Ainsworth?

13:10.040 --> 13:13.720
Carlo is certainly very attentive,
but also very proper.

13:13.720 --> 13:16.920
At least, I've always found him
to be that way.

13:16.920 --> 13:21.400
Is there a Countess Albani?
He's a widower.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.800
Oh, well, that explains it.
Thank you very much.

13:40.920 --> 13:44.040
God damn it to hell! Paola!

13:54.040 --> 13:57.480
Where did you get that, Lottie?
Mr Wingfield lent it to us.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.120
To say thank you
for Billy finding him a bicycle.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.160
So, what are you doing?

14:02.160 --> 14:05.400
I am... Can you hold these for me,
please?

14:05.400 --> 14:08.880
Just for a moment.
This is going to be the net.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.040
The net?

14:12.880 --> 14:15.400
You know, for tennis.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.680
Good Lord, don't tell me
you've never heard of tennis.

14:17.680 --> 14:22.920
Not that I know of.
Wimbledon, no?

14:22.920 --> 14:25.600
This isn't another elaborate jape,
is it, Miss March?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.200
Like that business
with your letters.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.360
I swear on my life.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.240
Well, maybe there is something
we can teach you, then.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.960
You ready? Holding out like this.
Pop!

14:36.960 --> 14:40.000
Oh!
Come on, come on. Let's go.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.520
One more try, one more try.
Oh!

14:42.520 --> 14:44.520
In again. Second serve.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.160
Oh!

14:47.160 --> 14:48.400
Yes!
Wow!

14:48.400 --> 14:50.680
That was good!
You've got quite an arm on you!

14:50.680 --> 14:52.400
We need to draw some lines.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.960
Right, come on, then.
Miss March, your turn.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.840
Your mother doesn't pay me
to lark around, Mr Ainsworth.

15:00.840 --> 15:04.720
Nonsense. Come on.
All right.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.480
Ready?
I'll try.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.400
THEY LAUGH

15:12.640 --> 15:14.640
Let's have a serve?

15:20.960 --> 15:23.280
Ooh!
OK.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.720
Beautiful! That was a rally!

15:30.720 --> 15:33.120
Alice, you have so many
pretty dresses.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.320
SHE GASPS

15:35.320 --> 15:37.120
That one is pretty.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.640
Maybe we should think about
what to say to Lady Caroline

15:39.640 --> 15:41.440
when we're there.
LAUGHTER OUTSIDE

15:41.440 --> 15:44.000
Do you think the house will be
absolutely huge?

15:44.000 --> 15:47.200
I told my mother that I'd meet
someone special over here.

15:48.520 --> 15:52.080
Oh, look at this sweet little dress
that's Lottie's.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.240
Great!

15:54.240 --> 15:57.120
You're not getting anywhere
with you holding it like that.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.600
Hand on the grip.

15:59.680 --> 16:04.840
Right. From down the racket and
then nice circle. Follow through.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.360
Right?

16:08.360 --> 16:09.920
There you go. See?

16:12.240 --> 16:14.400
What about this one?

16:15.920 --> 16:18.680
Alice!
Oh, gosh, no.

16:18.680 --> 16:21.280
I look about a hundred in that one.
I think it's pretty.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.440
This one.
That one is pretty.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.440
Try that?

16:44.520 --> 16:46.600
'La Donna E Mobile'

16:47.880 --> 16:49.120
SHE MUTTERS

17:10.880 --> 17:14.520
Crikey, it's baking.
Isn't it wonderful?

17:14.520 --> 17:17.440
Pelham will fry,
cycling in this heat.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.520
They say you have to be mad,
or English,

17:19.520 --> 17:22.520
to go out in the middle of the day.
I must be both.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.520
I'll look like a lobster
if I'm not careful.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.520
Don't you feel it?

17:31.520 --> 17:34.760
Sure. If I stay out too long.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.360
But do you...? You know.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.080
Go darker?

17:40.800 --> 17:44.040
We all change colour
in the sun, honey.

17:44.040 --> 17:48.120
You don't mind me asking?
I've been asked worse than that.

17:50.240 --> 17:54.160
Do you know, I think I might
go for a wander. Maybe get a drink.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.360
You go ahead.
I'll join you in a bit.

18:23.680 --> 18:26.640
Ciao.
Ciao.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.360
Lei e la Signora Turner.

18:34.360 --> 18:39.400
I've seen you at the Hotel.
Roberto. Roberto Albani.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.520
Pleased to meet you, Roberto Albani.

18:47.600 --> 18:52.040
My English is, um... little.

18:52.040 --> 18:55.080
Don't worry, honey.
We don't need to talk.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.600
You like?

19:07.600 --> 19:11.000
Sure. I like.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.240
LOW CHATTER

20:17.920 --> 20:20.000
He wasn't impressed
by your Italian.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.720
I may as well
have been speaking Chinese.

20:21.720 --> 20:25.080
Thank heavens you know how to point.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.560
Grazie.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.400
Che baldi giovani!

20:38.400 --> 20:41.320
Cosa stai guardando?

20:41.320 --> 20:43.160
Hey, negretto!

20:43.160 --> 20:45.720
Tutto bene?
Don't. Lucian, it's not worth it.

20:47.560 --> 20:51.040
Venite qui, baldi giovani!

20:54.200 --> 20:56.880
Come on, Lucian. Keep walking.
They're following us.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.760
Just keep walking. Ignore them.
We don't want to make things worse.

20:59.760 --> 21:03.480
Hey, voi! Cosa state facendo?
Don't make any eye contact.

21:06.360 --> 21:07.560
Hurry. Go!

21:14.720 --> 21:16.080
Andiamo!

21:25.840 --> 21:30.000
Signori...
May I be of assistance?

21:30.000 --> 21:33.480
Er, no. Thank you,
we don't require any assistance.

21:33.480 --> 21:38.120
They will not harm you in daylight.
Perhaps just humiliate you.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.600
Please, this way.

21:51.360 --> 21:53.680
The hotel is that way.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.400
How do you know where we're staying?

21:55.400 --> 21:57.680
Everyone knows
where the English live.

21:57.680 --> 22:00.240
I'm not an Englishman.
Then you only behave like one.

22:04.560 --> 22:06.840
My friends
met you there this morning.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.880
There's no-one else in Portofino
who looks like you.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.640
How is the boy?
He'll be lucky to see again.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.200
Has someone else examined him?

22:14.200 --> 22:16.960
The doctors here,
they're not for people like us.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.040
And who are the people like you?
The ones who fight.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.440
We've both seen the horrors
that happen when men fight.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.040
Then what will you do,
when they come for you?

22:36.040 --> 22:40.240
There are no fascisti in England.
Of course there are, my friend.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.880
They just have not
put on a shirt yet.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.320
Well...

22:51.520 --> 22:53.160
Nish!

23:04.200 --> 23:10.600
Then the fair Helen chose a prince,
whose name was Me...

23:10.600 --> 23:13.120
Menelaus.

23:13.120 --> 23:18.040
The brother of Aga..memnon.

23:18.040 --> 23:21.440
That's right.
Who reigned in M...

23:23.200 --> 23:26.800
It's Mycenae.
You're really doing very well.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.840
KNOCKING

23:28.840 --> 23:30.440
I wasn't told you had company.

23:30.440 --> 23:32.920
It's all right.
We're reading Homer.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.280
The children's version.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.720
Did you want something?
It can wait.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.640
Oh, come on.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.840
I was hoping you could
tell me where this is.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.480
L'Ancora. It's a tavern.
It's in town.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.560
"We are fighting
to defend the fatherland.

23:53.560 --> 23:59.360
"We are building a new Italy.
We are defending social justice."

23:59.360 --> 24:01.400
All rather schoolboy, isn't it?

24:01.400 --> 24:04.160
Very cloak-and-dagger,
all this anti-Fascism.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.760
Don't tell me
you're actually thinking of going.

24:09.760 --> 24:13.840
You're mocking me?
For wanting to inform myself.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.720
All right, don't be so...
Do you think Mussolini is a joke?

24:16.720 --> 24:19.560
No, I think that all politicians
are contemptible.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.960
Of whatever stripe.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.560
I'm sorry.
It's not worth falling out over.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.320
I just thought it wouldn't hurt
to know a little more

24:32.320 --> 24:34.680
about what was happening here.

24:35.800 --> 24:39.000
It's all right.
I should be the one apologising

24:39.000 --> 24:41.480
for being such a dilettante.
I've ruined your lesson.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.720
We'd almost finished.
Please. Don't leave on my account.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.040
They'll be wanting to know
where I am.

24:47.040 --> 24:50.520
You mustn't think much of us at all,
arguing over nothing.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.200
Well, it didn't seem like
nothing to me.

24:53.200 --> 24:57.600
My brother Arthur says there's
a Fascist lurking in all of us.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.280
He sounds like a wise man.
Not really.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.720
He emigrated to Canada and...
he can't stand the cold.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.840
Do you have a big family?

25:09.840 --> 25:11.560
Not any more.

25:11.560 --> 25:16.000
It's just my mum left at home now,
and little Tommy.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.480
It must have been hard for her,
to let you go.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.840
And what about you, Mr Sengupta?

25:24.400 --> 25:27.360
I haven't seen my family
for the better part of ten years.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.320
Ten years?
Yes, his father packed him off

25:30.320 --> 25:35.440
to be educated like an Englishman.
Oh. And how long does that take?

25:35.440 --> 25:38.000
I'll let you know when I find out.

25:45.120 --> 25:48.720
Where have you been?
I'm sorry, ma'am.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.120
If I've rung the bell once,
I've rung it a thousand times.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.680
Help Francesco and take these
up to Mrs Turner's room.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.720
She can't seem
to get into her bathroom.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.200
Of course, ma'am.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.400
KNOCKING

26:10.720 --> 26:13.720
Leave it over there, please.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.680
Can you help me, honey?
I've got sand everywhere.

27:08.960 --> 27:13.000
It's all right.
No law against looking.

27:15.360 --> 27:17.760
I guess you haven't seen
skin like mine before, have you?

27:21.440 --> 27:25.720
I imagine Helen of Troy,
she must have looked a lot like you.

27:27.760 --> 27:32.240
And who's Helen of Troy?
A woman in my book.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.640
They fought wars over her.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.680
Well, I'll do my best
not to start another.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.120
Wars are bad for business.

28:07.320 --> 28:10.080
'For He Is An Englishman'
from 'HMS Pinafore'

28:10.080 --> 28:14.200
# He is an Englishman

28:15.200 --> 28:20.920
# For he himself has said it

28:20.920 --> 28:25.920
# And it's greatly to his credit

28:25.920 --> 28:29.800
# That he is an Englishman

28:29.800 --> 28:34.360
# For he is an Englishman

28:34.360 --> 28:38.320
# For he might have been a "Roosian"

28:38.320 --> 28:44.040
# Or French, or Turk, or "Proosian"

28:44.040 --> 28:48.160
# Or perhaps Itali-an

28:48.160 --> 28:53.920
# Or perhaps Itali-an... #

28:53.920 --> 28:56.040
Oh, Lady Latchmere.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.600
Oh!
I didn't see you there.

28:59.760 --> 29:02.520
I keep on telling myself
I must get dressed for dinner.

29:02.520 --> 29:05.960
# He remains an Englishman... #

29:05.960 --> 29:10.160
This song always makes me smile.
Indeed.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.000
The Italians gave us opera,
and this is what we did with it.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.240
We are a funny nation.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.520
I suppose we always have Elgar.

29:18.520 --> 29:24.040
You know I... I saw HMS Pinafore
at the Savoy, before the war.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.760
Did you?

29:27.320 --> 29:29.040
With Ernest.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.920
Ernest?

29:39.080 --> 29:40.560
He's my youngest.

29:42.560 --> 29:46.360
Oh, my. He is handsome.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.120
Yes, he is. Was.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.920
He, um... He trod on a landmine.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.240
Somewhere called Mount Sorrel.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.880
He died nine years ago tomorrow.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.720
He'd only been there five minutes.

30:16.920 --> 30:23.160
"Unable are the loved to die,
for love is immortality".

30:25.200 --> 30:29.560
That's...
That's beautifully expressed.

30:29.560 --> 30:34.680
Oh, it's not me.
It's by my favourite poet.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.280
Here.

30:38.240 --> 30:41.480
Oh, Emily Dickinson.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.120
Oh, for me?
Yes, of course.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.720
Oh, thank you very much, my dear.
That's very kind.

30:49.720 --> 30:55.240
And, er...
And thank you for listening.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.960
How's your friend, Billy?

31:19.960 --> 31:22.600
I promised Mrs Ainsworth
I'd stay out of it.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.080
Don't you want to know?

31:29.640 --> 31:30.960
I got word this afternoon.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.360
They think he might lose the eye.

31:34.360 --> 31:38.040
Are you nearly finished, Billy?
Yes, Mrs Mays-Smith.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.000
Mr Sengupta.

32:00.320 --> 32:05.400
I'll send Francesco up later,
Mrs Turner. To fetch everything.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.200
There's really no need.
Take it, child.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.480
I couldn't.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.160
Would you prefer one of these?

32:12.680 --> 32:14.080
I wouldn't know what to do with it.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.600
Oh, it's easy enough!
Come on, let me show you.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.480
Sit down.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.440
Never mind them fighting over me,
honey.

32:59.440 --> 33:02.920
You've got everything it takes
to start your own damn war.

33:02.920 --> 33:07.920
No-one notices me.
It's because you're hiding.

33:07.920 --> 33:12.040
You can't be afraid to show them
what you've got. What you want.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.200
Mrs Mays-Smith won't like it.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.240
It isn't her we're aiming to please.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.240
LOW CHATTER

33:53.920 --> 33:55.320
Sorry.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.960
Thank you.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.720
Left on your own, again?
Seems that way.

34:13.360 --> 34:16.200
Something about you. It's different.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.040
BUSY CHATTER

35:18.440 --> 35:20.000
Put it over there.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.040
Is she new?
It's Constance. The nanny.

35:27.640 --> 35:28.760
If you'll excuse me.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.880
Cecil, where are you going?
Mm? It's a surprise.

35:38.400 --> 35:41.960
Caught the sun, look at me now.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.880
Oh, for heaven's sake!

35:43.880 --> 35:45.440
Buongiorno.

35:45.440 --> 35:49.560
Er, spedizione? Delivery? Yes?

35:49.560 --> 35:51.440
Ah, there she is.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.720
Oh, Christ, please,
please be careful with her.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.320
Right. Follow me! Avanti.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.560
APPLAUSE
I'll be back soon.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.760
Ah, there you are.
Yes, I saw the truck from my window.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.720
All in one piece?
It seems to be.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.280
I'll show it to you later
or I shall be missed at tea.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.360
Oh, no. You go ahead.

36:19.360 --> 36:22.640
We can leave the grand unveiling
until tomorrow.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.920
Uh-huh.
I'm sure it'll be worth the wait.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.960
Yes. Well, let's hope so.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.840
Was there something else?
Ah, of course.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.040
Typical bloody Italians.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.880
Delivery for you.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.920
That's right.
From England.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.400
I fail to see what business
that is of yours.

36:55.800 --> 36:59.160
Everything here is the business
of the Consiglio Comunale,

36:59.160 --> 37:03.560
Signor Ainsworth. Police, licensing.
Taxes on imports, for example.

37:03.560 --> 37:05.760
THEY CHUCKLE

37:05.760 --> 37:08.640
Well, there's nothing
to concern you here.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.360
More tea?

37:14.040 --> 37:16.000
All gone?
Every last one.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.040
That were quick!
They wolfed them down.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.640
I had to beg every cucumber
within three miles for those.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.520
Count Albani had most of them.
I lost count at seven.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.680
I love a man with a good appetite.

37:27.800 --> 37:31.160
Gives us something to hold onto.
Betty!

37:31.160 --> 37:34.120
It's hard to imagine him
with that slip of a girl.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.320
You hadn't noticed?
Noticed what?

37:37.320 --> 37:41.200
Him making eyes at Mrs Mays-Smith.
She's half his age!

37:41.200 --> 37:43.920
She is, but she could do
a lot worse.

37:43.920 --> 37:47.080
I bet he could put a smile
back on that sourpuss of hers.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.840
Shhh!

37:48.840 --> 37:50.840
What happened to Lottie's father?

37:52.760 --> 37:55.240
Same as happened
to the rest of them.

37:56.720 --> 37:57.840
The war.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.480
He got half his face blown off.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.360
It was a blessing he didn't survive.

38:08.840 --> 38:13.520
Right! Chop-chop, come on!
Let's get these plated up.

38:13.520 --> 38:16.880
There's nowt so sad
as a cold fat rascal.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.320
True, true.
You all right, Billy, son?

38:19.320 --> 38:21.680
Here, come on. Hurry up.
Paola, ready?

38:21.680 --> 38:23.040
Ready. Ready.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.200
All good?
Yeah, let's go.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.320
LIGHT CHATTER

38:40.000 --> 38:43.240
Scusatemi.
Prego.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.720
Ah, Signor Danioni,

38:53.720 --> 38:56.960
surely you're not looking
for something else to steal.

38:58.440 --> 39:04.280
Please, please. You know what?

39:04.280 --> 39:06.920
I really think we should be friends.

39:06.920 --> 39:10.360
Ah! But friends
don't blackmail one another.

39:10.360 --> 39:11.920
Again this word.

39:13.640 --> 39:18.040
Look, you've given me
a gift for my wife.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.200
Mm?

39:20.200 --> 39:23.200
And I've given you customers
for your hotel.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.920
This is how it works
between friends.

39:26.920 --> 39:30.720
Dare e ricevere.
Exactly.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.600
Give and take.

39:32.600 --> 39:36.560
And then, of course,
some have more to give than others.

39:36.560 --> 39:40.160
But that's the way it is.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.520
I'll see you around.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.120
VOICES OUTSIDE

40:15.280 --> 40:18.080
Sorry about that.
My wife ordered this tea party...

40:18.080 --> 40:22.320
Oh, no. Not a bit of it.
I've got plenty to keep me busy.

40:22.320 --> 40:27.800
Now, the moment of truth.
Yeah.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.120
Here she is.

40:40.560 --> 40:45.160
First impressions?
Well, it's smaller than I expected.

40:46.680 --> 40:51.480
Is that a problem?
Well, you don't buy art by the yard.

40:51.480 --> 40:52.640
Of course.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.640
Mm.
Well?

40:58.640 --> 41:00.960
Well, I'm not the expert.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.440
But what's your instinct?

41:04.280 --> 41:06.400
Well, it certainly his style.

41:06.400 --> 41:07.760
Excellent.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.000
Yeah, but before
you get too excited,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.880
remember he had a workshop churning
out hundreds of these things.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.840
Some he painted himself,
some he just painted a little.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.880
And some he just supervised.

41:18.880 --> 41:22.760
It's more likely "school of Rubens"
than Rubens.

41:22.760 --> 41:28.760
But, er... it could pass?

41:29.880 --> 41:31.880
Yeah. Yeah, it could pass.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.840
And how much to authenticate?
Oh.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.520
A few hundred dollars, maybe.
No, no, no.

41:37.520 --> 41:42.720
I mean, how much to ensure
it's authenticated?

41:42.720 --> 41:44.280
Oh.

41:47.120 --> 41:49.520
40 percent if she goes
for over a hundred thousand.

41:49.520 --> 41:52.080
One percent less
for every two thousand beneath.

41:53.200 --> 41:56.080
Let's start at 25, shall we?
30.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.760
Done.

41:57.760 --> 42:01.320
Now, it goes without saying,
I'll need a copy of the letter

42:01.320 --> 42:03.960
of authentication
and a down payment,

42:03.960 --> 42:05.320
before I'll hand her over.

42:06.520 --> 42:10.520
It goes without saying.
It's a deal.

42:20.200 --> 42:23.640
I'll have Francesco
have it locked up until tomorrow.

42:23.640 --> 42:24.680
Yeah.

42:45.840 --> 42:50.120
Are you feeling any better, darling?
A little better.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.920
Well enough to come?

42:53.040 --> 42:57.000
I'd only spoil it for you.
Very well.

42:59.680 --> 43:03.120
Although I have to say
I'm very disappointed in you, Rose.

43:03.120 --> 43:05.200
I'm sorry, Mama.

43:05.200 --> 43:08.280
I did tell you not to stay out
in the sun so long.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.960
You'll end up looking like
one of the locals.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.080
MR TURNER:
You're sure you don't mind?

43:20.080 --> 43:23.360
I'll say it again, I don't mind.

43:24.920 --> 43:30.800
Ainsworth says this Harborne guy
has a massive pile back in London.

43:30.800 --> 43:34.440
Packed full of art, apparently.
He sounds like quite the catch.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.480
Oh, come on, baby.

43:39.880 --> 43:43.320
Baby, come on. Don't be mad.
I'd much rather be here with you.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.360
I've hardly seen you
the whole god damned time.

43:45.360 --> 43:47.680
Well, I have a business
to take care of.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.480
No, Jack.
You have to take care of me.

43:53.920 --> 43:57.000
You don't want to be
seen out with me. Is that it?

43:57.000 --> 44:00.040
Oh Jesus, Claudine, come on,
I already told you.

44:00.040 --> 44:03.920
The Drummond-Ward girl has a
migraine, there's only room for one.

44:05.800 --> 44:09.840
Hey! I brought you here, didn't I?
I'm beginning to wonder why.

44:12.840 --> 44:14.480
Careful.

44:42.840 --> 44:44.480
There you go.

I wish I could dance like you.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.640
Don't you know a professional

45:37.640 --> 45:40.640
You dance for a living?
Amongst other things.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.080
My name's in lights.

45:43.080 --> 45:47.040

It sounds so French.

45:59.960 --> 46:03.000
Where is your husband?
Gone to bed.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.400
He's awfully boring
when he's got a tournament.

46:05.400 --> 46:07.440
All right.

46:07.440 --> 46:08.560
Come on!

46:16.200 --> 46:17.240
Rose.

46:19.280 --> 46:23.760
Your mother said you had a migraine.
I feel much better now.

46:26.480 --> 46:31.440
Come on in. Join us, honey.
Nobody here's gonna tell you no.

46:37.640 --> 46:38.960
Grazie.

46:40.400 --> 46:43.160
You can do it!

Oh, just a bit longer.

Now, that's a party.

50:10.280 --> 50:13.640
Now, that was
rather an unfortunate timing.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.280
Did my mother say anything?

50:15.280 --> 50:18.520
She said it might be an idea
for us all to go to bed.

50:18.520 --> 50:21.480
Well... I'm not going to
be able to sleep now.

50:21.480 --> 50:23.880
I'm completely wired.
Me too.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.160

I think that it's

To think that a daughter of mine

50:55.600 --> 50:57.920
would behave
in such a disgraceful manner.

50:57.920 --> 51:00.160
In front of members

51:00.160 --> 51:03.520
In front of Bella Ainsworth,

51:03.520 --> 51:06.120
Lord alone knows what your father's
going to say when I write

51:06.120 --> 51:09.000

I'll tell him about this.

Sono loro, non noi.

51:57.560 --> 52:00.000
Che cercano di distruggere

52:00.000 --> 52:03.520

di conquistare coraggiosamente.

52:11.040 --> 52:14.320
Of justice. Of civic responsibility.

52:14.320 --> 52:16.720
Because it is them, not us,

52:16.720 --> 52:20.520
who seek to bind Italian people
in subservient flattery,

52:20.520 --> 52:22.600
to the lies
