Previously on Legacies...

00:02.202 --> 00:03.737
LIZZIE: Welcome to
the Salvatore School.

00:03.737 --> 00:05.372
I'm Josie.
I'm Lizzie.
Sisters.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.341
We are a school for
the supernatural.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.443
Which covers
a lot of territory.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.511
HOPE: I'm a hybrid of
three different creatures.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.180
Tri-brid.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.249
I knew Hope went to
some fancy boarding school.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.451
People in town said
it was for troubled rich kids.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.887
This is a safe place
for people like Rafael.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.356
ALARIC:
I'm sorry, Langdon.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.658
But you don't belong here.
Then where do I belong?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.693
I'm still nursing
a wounded soul.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.161
Penelope Park.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.596
I am an equal opportunity

00:29.596 --> 00:31.498
evil temptress.
JOSIE: MG?

00:39.473 --> 00:41.375
I'm not gonna
remember any of this.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.509
Probably not.

00:42.509 --> 00:44.778
LANDON:
Well, in that case.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.546
What's wrong?
The alarm
didn't trigger.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.748
ALARIC: What was it?
DORIAN: Knife.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.249
Supernatural origins unknown.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.317
HOPE:
How do you know it was him?

00:50.317 --> 00:51.652
It's not possible, okay?

00:51.652 --> 00:53.320
I'm not that stupid.
I know how to track him,

00:53.320 --> 00:55.455
but it involves
using dark magic.

00:55.455 --> 00:58.792
Inveniet hostium et tenebrae.
Inveniet hostium...

00:58.792 --> 01:00.193
DONOVAN: Local PD thinks
it was a chemical spill.

01:00.193 --> 01:02.429
ALARIC:
What's the actual story?

01:02.429 --> 01:04.898
DONOVAN: I'll leave that
to you to figure out.

01:07.200 --> 01:10.337
(birds chirping,
insects trilling)

01:11.838 --> 01:14.374
♪ ♪

01:20.914 --> 01:24.952
HOPE: "No legacy
is so rich as honesty."

01:24.952 --> 01:27.854
When Shakespeare wrote that,
he obviously didn't know

01:27.854 --> 01:30.223
what I know about teenage boys.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.359
I mean, I know there are
guys with integrity,

01:32.359 --> 01:33.760
who lead with truth.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.696
I've just never met
any of them.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.801
EMMA: I see you've
decided to double down

01:40.801 --> 01:42.235
on your nihilism this morning.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.471
I'm trying to be
rich with honesty.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.340
Start from the beginning.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.843
Of my short-lived but
horrific romances with liars?

01:49.843 --> 01:51.678
Of your decision
to perform black magic

01:51.678 --> 01:53.347
on school grounds last night.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.782
Maybe we could table this
until I catch the guy

01:55.782 --> 01:58.418
I was trying to find
by using black magic.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.620
Because the longer
that Landon Kirby is out there,

02:00.620 --> 02:02.823
the greater the chance he tells
people about this school

02:02.823 --> 02:05.392
and the kind of people we have
hidden behind the gates.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.494
You know there's a beacon

02:07.494 --> 02:09.296
that alerts me
when someone's using.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.697
You knew you would be caught.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.966
After I found Landon,
but we lost the trail

02:12.966 --> 02:14.534
and now I'm being interrogated.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.638
But go ahead, take your time.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.406
Nothing at stake here.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.208
Did anyone help you
with the spell?

02:26.279 --> 02:28.782
No. Can I go now?

02:28.782 --> 02:32.052
Hope. You're a student.

02:32.052 --> 02:36.523
This isn't your fight.
It's absolutely
my fight, Emma.

02:36.523 --> 02:39.326
Landon was inside the walls
of this school because of me.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.062
He had access to the knife
he stole because of me.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.564
We're at risk of exposure
because of me.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.299
And you can tell me
that I'm sublimating

02:46.299 --> 02:48.368
a lifetime
of survivor's remorse,

02:48.368 --> 02:50.404
or whatever it says
in my file here,

02:50.404 --> 02:51.972
but I'm gonna help
Dr. Saltzman find him.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.446
And what happens when you do?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.621
HOPE: It should be
said that Shakespeare

03:07.621 --> 03:09.856
wasn't completely clueless.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.025
He had plenty of advice

03:12.025 --> 03:14.728
about how to handle betrayal.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.663
My personal favorite:
"Think, therefore,

03:16.663 --> 03:18.999
on revenge and cease to weep."

03:29.976 --> 03:32.345
Let's hit the dining hall
and carb load.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.014
It's game day.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.615
I'm not hungry.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.987
What?
Well, uh, funny thing
actually, Josette.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.722
This morning, as I was
desperately trying

03:42.722 --> 03:44.758
to make this trash bag
of a jersey look cute,

03:44.758 --> 03:47.527
I suddenly had
the urge to purge.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.563
So I fled to the bowl,
and lo and behold,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.531
I heaved up a gallon
of black goo.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.600
So, seeing as I haven't
been dabbling in any

03:53.600 --> 03:55.068
illicit black magic recently,

03:55.068 --> 03:58.738
I can only imagine it was
a twin sympathy hurl.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.440
And here you are,

04:00.440 --> 04:02.809
denying the day's
most important meal.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.445
So fess up.
What did you do?

04:05.445 --> 04:08.148
PENELOPE: Maybe you're
pregnant, Lizzie.

04:08.148 --> 04:11.551
Oh, or maybe it's just
how that jersey fits.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.920
Go away, evil one.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.523
Already gone.
Hot tip:

04:16.523 --> 04:18.658
next time you burn
your ex's hair off,

04:18.658 --> 04:20.360
make sure she can't rock a lob.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.735
Morning! Big game today...

04:28.735 --> 04:30.737
Bounce, MG.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.739
If you hurry, you can catch up
with the Blair Bitch

04:32.739 --> 04:34.608
and tongue-chum her again.

04:36.710 --> 04:40.780
Did she who shall not be
named just fat

04:42.482 --> 04:44.117
Hey, girls, listen.
Don't do it.

04:45.785 --> 04:47.721
Don't say whatever it is
you're about to say because

04:47.721 --> 04:49.055
you have Dad face, and
wherever Dad face goes,

04:49.055 --> 04:51.691
daughter disappointment
always follows.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.593
I'm sorry; I can't
make the game today.

04:53.593 --> 04:54.761
But, Dad, you're the coach.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.163
And I'm QB1 this year.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.831
I hate it as
much as you do,

04:57.831 --> 04:59.166
but I have to find Landon Kirby.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.600
Okay, so, let's cancel.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.902
I mean, it's a joke anyways.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.804
We can't use our powers,
so we suck.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.139
Exactly.
Which is a normal school

05:06.139 --> 05:07.841
for troubled rich
kids thing to do.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.643
This annual event
lets the locals see you

05:09.643 --> 05:11.178
for what they think you are.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.513
And keeps them from
asking too many questions.

05:13.513 --> 05:14.948
But they mock us.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.449
Because they're insecure,
small-town kids

05:16.449 --> 05:17.617
with small minds.

05:17.617 --> 05:20.053
So just let it be.
Look, girls,

05:20.053 --> 05:22.189
with Landon running around,
knowing all of our secrets,

05:22.189 --> 05:26.092
we have to protect
our profile now more than ever.

05:26.092 --> 05:28.728
Can I count on you
guys to do that?

05:28.728 --> 05:31.731
All right. I love you both.

05:31.731 --> 05:34.901
We'll be back as
soon as we can.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.102
Wait.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.038
Who's "we"?

05:45.579 --> 05:46.880
Hello?

05:51.017 --> 05:53.787

If you want this car to
work, I'm going with you.

You should stay out of it.
He's a liar and a thief.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.275
He took a stupid knife.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.143
Nothing in this school
is a stupid anything.

06:17.143 --> 06:21.047
Look. He's my best friend.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.984
And you? You seem vengeful.

06:27.587 --> 06:29.122
Let me show you something.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.166
Close your eyes.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.587

to a bus full of people

07:02.622 --> 07:04.591
on Route 29 last night,
and I am the only one

07:04.591 --> 07:08.295

more than us.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.322
You're being
melodramatic, okay?

07:35.322 --> 07:36.923
He's missing one game.

07:36.923 --> 07:40.960
First a game
and then our weddings.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.096
This game is
an opportunity.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.598
We can show him how seriously

our secret stays protected

07:47.734 --> 07:49.102
out there on the field.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.904
Today, we will lose

07:50.904 --> 07:53.740
even more epically
than we normally do.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.009
Win by losing.
That's the spirit.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.711
There's someone
we need to recruit

07:57.711 --> 07:59.379
to our Island
of Misfit Toys.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.782
Tall, hot and handsome.

gonna be at the game.

He hopped the Hope train
out of town.

08:14.961 --> 08:16.796
Just like your Dad.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.217
I don't know why
he's still out here.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.053
He has a whole day's lead on us.
He could be anywhere.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.955
Maybe 'cause he doesn't
have a reason to run.

08:41.955 --> 08:43.790
Logic that would be
perfectly believable

08:43.790 --> 08:45.158

what happened?

09:13.019 --> 09:14.354
Is she a survivor?

09:14.354 --> 09:16.623
Uh, smells like it.
She reeks of smoke.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.859
I think she's in shock.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.461
Look, I need to
get her to the police

09:21.461 --> 09:23.163
so she she can get
some medical attention.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.766
Uh, why don't you two go ahead?
Don't engage.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.368
We don't know how
dangerous Landon is.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.403
He's not dangerous...
I said don't engage.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.940
Come on.

09:37.477 --> 09:40.046
I need to get you
some help.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.915
If you want to follow me.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.858
All right, guys.

09:51.858 --> 09:56.229
Let's have a good, clean,
entirely uneventful game.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.665
Like we do every year
when we beat your asses down.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.202
Not exactly the
spirit, Kyle.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.137
Oh.
All right, call
in the air.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.008
Tails never fails.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.745
Guess not. Your ball.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.080
Shake hands and
let's do this.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.215
MAN:
Go. Huddle, huddle.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.055
Kaleb. Come on,
suck it up.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.424
We have to go through
this every year, okay?

10:24.424 --> 10:26.092
I was being recruited
by D1 schools

10:26.092 --> 10:28.061
before I got here, all right?
I don't lose.

10:28.061 --> 10:31.364
Hey. You do today. Okay?

10:36.002 --> 10:37.470
Good luck out there.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.473
Luck is what happens when
preparation meets opportunity.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.443
I'm pretty sure I've seen that
on a poster at the dentist's.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.446
Oh, my dad's a dentist, but
he still made time to be here.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.381
I guess I'm lucky
that way, huh?

10:58.525 --> 11:00.460
What exactly
happened on that bus?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.262
No one knows.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.564
It's like something
incinerated it from the inside.

11:04.564 --> 11:07.166
Look, whatever he did, I know
there's a good explanation.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.235
He's the most loyal friend
that I've ever had.

11:09.235 --> 11:13.873
He was there for me
on the worst day of my life.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.208
After my
girlfriend died,

11:15.208 --> 11:16.943
he's the only thing
that kept me going.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.845
So let me get that
knife back for you

11:18.845 --> 11:21.147
and then we both can
hear him out, okay?

11:21.147 --> 11:22.949
Appreciate
the passion,

11:22.949 --> 11:25.318
but maybe you should exert
some of it making new friends.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.922
So I can be as popular
and well

11:28.922 --> 11:30.456
Yeah,

11:30.456 --> 11:32.191
I've been at the school
for two days

11:32.191 --> 11:33.927
and I've already heard
all about Hope Mikaelson

11:33.927 --> 11:34.994
and her sunny disposition.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.499
I'll get you the stupid,
not-stupid knife

11:39.499 --> 11:41.868
and the answers
you want.

11:41.868 --> 11:42.969
I promise.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.337
And why should I believe you?

11:44.337 --> 11:45.939
Because I don't lie.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.943
Everybody lies.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.081
He's in the root cellar.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.318
You have three minutes
to do this your way.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.919
Wait, the headmaster
said don't engage.

11:59.919 --> 12:02.822
Two minutes, 59.
Two minutes, 58.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.403
Raf? Holy hell.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.472
How did you find me?

12:19.472 --> 12:20.940
There's, um,
a-a lot of crazy

12:20.940 --> 12:22.275
witchy people
looking for you.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.377
There's a bus full
of burned-up people...

12:24.377 --> 12:26.112
That wasn't me.
HOPE: Then who was it?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.948
You said
three minutes.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.049
Like I said, people lie.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.284
Corporis impetu.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.188
Hey!

12:36.222 --> 12:37.590
Where's the knife?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.392
I don't have it.
I must've lost it when I ran.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.527
After you burned the bus?
That wasn't me, I swear.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.096
I barely got out alive.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.397
Hope, come on.
Last chance.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.165
Who the hell was it?

12:46.165 --> 12:47.900
There was this girl...

12:58.978 --> 13:00.613
Do you need to make
a phone call?

13:03.616 --> 13:06.219
Wait, wait,
that's mine.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.954
Can I have that...

13:07.954 --> 13:09.088
Hey.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.190
That-that-that's my watch.

13:13.259 --> 13:16.229
Hey, Miss, wait,
wait, Miss, I...

13:39.152 --> 13:42.155
Remember the
game plan, Kaleb.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.590
Girl, I used to eat townie
scrubs like this for lunch.

I was a vampire.

you pulled last night,

15:08.641 --> 15:09.776
kissing me like that.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.511
I was giving you
what you wanted.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.412
No, you were taking
a shot at Josie,

15:13.412 --> 15:15.648
and when someone other than
Lizzie takes a shot at Josie,

15:15.648 --> 15:17.250
they tend to wake up
with scabies.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.618
You ever have
scabies before?

15:18.618 --> 15:20.486
They're nasty.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.522
So Lizzie's mad at you?

15:23.790 --> 15:25.792
Meaning she sees you
for a change?

15:25.792 --> 15:29.128
So you did that
on purpose?

15:29.128 --> 15:31.364
I do everything on purpose.

Look, if Lizzie Saltzman
is what you want,

15:33.466 --> 15:34.567
I can help you
get her.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.538
But you're gonna have to do
exactly what I say.

she'd been dipped in an ashtray

and breathed fire
instead of words.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.369

16:10.369 --> 16:11.871
There are only
a couple dozen left,

23:52.131 --> 23:53.699
She steals treasure,

23:53.699 --> 23:55.301
breathes fire,
hides the loot in her lair.

23:55.301 --> 23:58.237
She's-she's not a pyromancer,
she's a...

23:58.237 --> 24:00.306
Dragons don't exist,
or look like normal people.

24:00.306 --> 24:02.141
There was a time we would have
said that about vampires.

24:03.642 --> 24:05.844
Okay, fine.

24:05.844 --> 24:08.881
She's a, a human dragon.

24:08.881 --> 24:11.016
Now what?
In anything I've ever read...

24:11.016 --> 24:12.184
In fiction.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.919
...the way to take down
a dragon,

24:13.919 --> 24:18.123
you need a buttload of courage
and a sword.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.160

where that came from.

25:45.144 --> 25:47.713
Not if she's got anything
to say about it.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.349
What are you doing?

25:50.349 --> 25:52.818
I'm calling
an audible of my own.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.022
Seriously?
I'm dead serious.

25:57.022 --> 25:58.424
And you should be, too.

25:58.424 --> 26:00.426
Dad told us to lose today
for a reason.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.161
Well, he ain't here.
So screw that.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.862
JOSIE: Yeah, no one would be
here if it weren't for him.

26:03.862 --> 26:06.298
My dad built this school
for supernaturals like us, so

26:06.298 --> 26:08.801
if we win by flaunting all the
things that make us different,

26:08.801 --> 26:10.736
we're gonna lose a lot more
than a stupid game.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.070
We'll lose everything.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.406
You really want Dad
to stop loving us? Keep it up.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.641
And if you don't...

26:19.912 --> 26:21.313
MG: She's right, Lizzie.
We got to lose the game.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.882
I didn't ask for your opinion.

26:23.882 --> 26:28.087
Or... door number three.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.055
Okay, we definitely didn't
ask for your opinion.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.323
And how on earth
do you always do that?

26:31.323 --> 26:33.292
It's like she appears
out of smoke.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.427
Hold up, hold up.
What's door number three?

26:35.427 --> 26:39.331
You win, without any of your
supernatural special sauce.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.435
Fair and square.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.471
Yeah, but we're
legitimately terrible.

26:45.471 --> 26:48.774
No, we used to be terrible,
but Kaleb's new this year.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.210
So am I. I can
help us win, too.

26:52.377 --> 26:53.946
Yo, I caught that pass earlier.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.314
JOSIE: Yeah,
but you cheated.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.382
You used your powers.
No, I didn't.

26:57.382 --> 26:59.318
I'm... I'm just,
I'm scrappy like that.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.321
Good idea, Satan.

27:02.321 --> 27:05.090
But to be clear,
you can't have my immortal soul.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.361
Fair and square.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.065
Let's do this.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.235
Solid.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.747
Promise kept.

27:30.115 --> 27:32.117
You both all right?

27:35.387 --> 27:37.389
Let's give her a proper burial.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.091
See if you can find a shovel.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.231
Dorian.

27:46.231 --> 27:47.232
Found it.

27:47.232 --> 27:48.367
The soft spot,

27:48.367 --> 27:49.835
that's how you kill it.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.036
Uh, knife in the heart
did the trick.

27:51.036 --> 27:55.007
Huh. Okay. So much for research.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.508
What are you reading,
Game of Thrones?

27:56.508 --> 27:58.143
"Puff, the Magic Dragon."

27:58.143 --> 28:00.379
Look, this just doesn't make
any sense.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.281
I-It has got to be
something else.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.156
Nope. It's a dragon, all right.

28:11.156 --> 28:13.058
I've got to call you back.
Ric.

28:13.058 --> 28:14.259
Ric!

28:14.259 --> 28:15.994
Dr. Saltzman...

28:19.998 --> 28:21.533
Oh, my God.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.556
Was that a...?
You guys go.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.325
Get to the car
and get out of here.
What about you?

28:46.325 --> 28:48.093
I have an idea.
What?

28:48.093 --> 28:50.829
She wants this.
She's going to be back.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.565
All right, you two,
go to the car.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.034
I'll meet you there. Go, go.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.204
You wake up
with a death wish today?

28:59.204 --> 29:01.173
Something like that.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.512
:
We want to hear you say go!

29:09.581 --> 29:13.118
Okay, guys, last play of
the game. It's Hail Mary time.

29:13.118 --> 29:15.921
Everyone but Josie, go long.
Wait. What do I do?

29:15.921 --> 29:17.055
It doesn't matter,
'cause there's no way

29:17.055 --> 29:18.357
I'm gonna throw you the ball.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.258
Lizzie. Look my way.
I'll catch it.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.361
Probably caught something
from Penelope Park, too.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.495
KALEB:
Knock it off.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.998
Look, we score, and those clowns

29:25.998 --> 29:28.233
can't say crap to us
for an entire year.

29:28.233 --> 29:30.135
Y'all feel me?
He's right, guys.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.503

31:31.123 --> 31:33.558

Tenebris anima vestra
contundito mortem.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.587
Et conteret spiritum.
Frange vitam.

32:02.587 --> 32:07.192
Nolite corde.
Ut sub terra esse,

32:07.192 --> 32:10.295

32:51.570 --> 32:53.338
Where did you come from?

32:53.338 --> 32:56.641
Why do you want this so badly?
What's so special about it?

32:58.643 --> 33:00.145
Say something.

33:24.636 --> 33:28.406
So, what'd I miss?

33:28.406 --> 33:30.575
WOMAN: Losers!

33:30.575 --> 33:33.545
Good game.
Suck it, loser.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.313
Not now, Dana!

33:36.915 --> 33:38.283
Hey, no, stop!

33:38.283 --> 33:40.518
Stop...

33:54.299 --> 33:57.135
Guess that was the soft spot.

34:04.910 --> 34:06.411
What is this?

34:08.313 --> 34:10.382
This isn't earth magic, Hope.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.751
This wasn't
an earth magic problem.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.854
We don't allow black magic.

34:15.854 --> 34:18.757
It gets inside your heart
and it poisons your mind.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.392
Now, I looked the other way
this morning

34:20.392 --> 34:21.660
'cause I knew
you were upset,

34:21.660 --> 34:23.228
but this is a death spell.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.930
A spell you couldn't
have known you need

34:24.930 --> 34:27.332
to use on a dragon,
which...

34:27.332 --> 34:30.201
which means you had
other plans for it.

34:34.806 --> 34:38.543
Landon did something stupid,
maybe evil.

34:38.543 --> 34:40.879
We won't know until
we learn more, but...

34:40.879 --> 34:43.882
he's still
just a kid, Hope...

34:43.882 --> 34:45.583
and so are you.

34:46.985 --> 34:50.855
This hatred...
this vengeance...

34:52.824 --> 34:55.760
This is your father.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.229
It can't be you.

34:58.229 --> 35:00.465
I won't allow it.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.771
Now, you bury her.

35:09.841 --> 35:12.277
And I'll see you
back at the car.

35:31.596 --> 35:33.498
Hey.

35:33.498 --> 35:37.402
Oh, whoa, towel on.
Please.

35:37.402 --> 35:40.405
'Cause vampire or not,
the last thing I want to see

35:40.405 --> 35:41.840
is your lost boy.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.742
Damn, Peez, you gotta
stop lurking.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.812
It's time for a strategy sesh.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.881
Nah, I listened
to you all day,

35:49.881 --> 35:51.282
and the only thing
your little tricks did

35:51.282 --> 35:52.717
was make the wrong girl
look my way.

35:52.717 --> 35:53.952
I'm out.

35:53.952 --> 35:58.890
This is a long con,
Milton. Trust me.

35:58.890 --> 36:02.327
Lizzie's nemesis Dana
liking you, oh,

36:02.327 --> 36:06.698
that's the puzzle piece you need
to crack Lizzie's candy shell

36:06.698 --> 36:08.633
and get to her gooey center.

36:08.633 --> 36:12.337
Today was a total win
for you.

36:12.337 --> 36:15.740
You hate Lizzie.
Why do you care?

36:20.645 --> 36:23.648
Some people just want
to watch the world burn.

36:39.664 --> 36:40.865
You mad at me

36:40.865 --> 36:43.334
'cause we lost the game?
No.

36:43.334 --> 36:46.037
I'm mad at the world, and you
just happen to be in it.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.277
Well, you're about to be.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.980
I did a little spell
at the game.

36:55.980 --> 36:59.384
I made Kaleb drop the ball.

36:59.384 --> 37:04.656
And I totally did
black magic with Hope.

37:04.656 --> 37:07.592
Well, let's just
call this what it is.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.728
You betrayed me.

37:12.764 --> 37:15.600
I was worried about
disappointing Dad.

37:17.702 --> 37:20.305
So I disappointed
you instead.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.420
I'll forgive you

37:35.420 --> 37:39.057
if you promise
not to keep secrets about

37:39.057 --> 37:41.526
doing black magic
with Hope.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.994
You're my sister,

37:42.994 --> 37:45.096
my best friend,

37:45.096 --> 37:46.598
and she spent the last ten years

37:46.598 --> 37:48.733
making us feel like
we don't matter.

37:48.733 --> 37:50.869
And I don't like
feeling that way.

37:50.869 --> 37:54.506
Not from Hope, and not
from girls like Dana,

37:54.506 --> 37:55.774
not from Dad

37:55.774 --> 37:57.976
and not from you.

37:57.976 --> 38:01.012
I promise.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.580
Okay? I'm sorry.

38:02.580 --> 38:04.516
It's okay.

38:05.817 --> 38:09.154
I mean, betrayal
and all aside,

38:09.154 --> 38:11.089
you had my back today.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.991
And you had mine.

38:20.765 --> 38:24.502
So, what are we
gonna do about Dad?

38:26.437 --> 38:30.074
More like what is he
gonna do to us?

38:35.613 --> 38:38.483
♪ ♪

38:46.691 --> 38:48.092
Where are they?

38:48.092 --> 38:49.961
Gone.

38:49.961 --> 38:53.398
I found this on the windshield
when I got back.

38:58.036 --> 39:01.039
LANDON:
Dear Hope, you strike me
as the kind of person

39:01.039 --> 39:02.941
who's not so big
on second chances,

39:02.941 --> 39:06.644
