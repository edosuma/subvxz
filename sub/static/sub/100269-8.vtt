00:19.019 --> 00:20.270
<i> Please let me out!</i>

00:20.895 --> 00:22.439
Ellie needs me.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.357
I know she does.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.862
I won't say a word.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.865
Okay? Fuck Henderson.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.743
You think I ever shed a tear
over that asshole?

00:34.826 --> 00:38.371
And-- and whatever this...
human aquarium thing is,

00:38.455 --> 00:40.123
I will not tell a soul.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.958
<i>I want to believe you, Delilah.</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:43.752
You don't have to worry. I'm not stupid.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.754
-<i> Oh, far from it.</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:51.718
<i>I want your story to end like Will's,</i>
<i>but you are a jaded gossip columnist</i>

00:51.801 --> 00:53.636
<i>with a cop for a fuckbuddy.</i>

00:53.720 --> 00:55.722
-Did you tell him you found this?
-No.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.515
No.  I was going to,

00:57.599 --> 01:00.435
but I didn't,
and now I'm definitely not going to.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.729
You want to prove I can trust you?

01:06.483 --> 01:08.026
<i>Delilah.</i>

01:09.527 --> 01:10.945
-H-Hey.
<i>-D!</i>

01:11.029 --> 01:12.655
Finally. What is going on?

01:13.031 --> 01:14.074
Um...

01:15.450 --> 01:18.119
I heard Ben got another DUI. Uh...

01:18.661 --> 01:19.496
Can you confirm?

01:20.413 --> 01:22.707
<i>That's what's so important right now?</i>

01:23.458 --> 01:26.336
Girl's gotta pay rent. So?

01:26.878 --> 01:28.630
Yeah.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.382
But... you didn't hear that from me.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.470
-Okay, thanks. Bye.
<i>-No, hang on.</i>

01:35.553 --> 01:36.971
Hang on, um...

01:38.807 --> 01:41.851
I've been thinking about
what you said, and, um...

01:42.977 --> 01:46.314
I want to take you out. Like, a real date.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.733
<i>Are-- are you free tonight?</i>

01:50.151 --> 01:51.361
I can't tonight.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.616
Um, but soon. Yeah, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

01:57.408 --> 01:59.410
<i>Yeah. All right.</i>

02:07.418 --> 02:09.212
You said prove it. I proved it.

02:09.712 --> 02:10.880
<i> As soon as she's free,</i>

02:10.964 --> 02:13.133
<i>she could run straight to him</i>
<i>and tell him everything. </i>

02:13.216 --> 02:15.301
Okay. You know what? You're right.

02:15.885 --> 02:20.098
It'd be naive to just trust me at my word,
so why don't we just come to an agreement?

02:20.557 --> 02:21.724
Okay? Let's negotiate.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.602
Do you want to buy my silence? I'm game.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.896
<i>That'd be ideal, but what do I have?</i>

02:26.980 --> 02:29.190
<i>-A few hundred bucks?</i>
-Please, Will.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.528
-I don't want to die in here.
-You won't.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.698
I promise.

02:36.781 --> 02:40.535
<i> And I mean it.</i>
<i>I won't let this situation go bad.</i>

02:40.618 --> 02:42.162
<i>I've been through that.</i>

02:42.704 --> 02:44.581
I'm gonna let you out tomorrow.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.667
<i>After I've made some arrangements</i>
<i>for me to escape.</i>

02:47.750 --> 02:48.710
What?

02:49.919 --> 02:51.880
Will, no! Will, don't leave! Will!

02:51.963 --> 02:54.507
- <i>Delilah </i>will <i>go free.</i>
<i>-</i> Will! Please don't leave me.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.385
<i> Even if it means</i>
<i>breaking my own heart.</i>

02:59.470 --> 03:01.097
<i>To be a man who's worthy of you,</i>

03:01.181 --> 03:03.433
<i>Love, I have to let you go.</i>

03:04.601 --> 03:06.269
<i>Goodbye, Love.</i>

03:07.729 --> 03:08.688
<i>In another reality,</i>

03:08.771 --> 03:11.065
<i>I'd be packing a picnic you made</i>

03:11.149 --> 03:15.028
<i>for us to share at Griffith Park</i>
<i>instead of the passport Will made me</i>

03:15.111 --> 03:16.738
<i>in case I ever needed it.</i>

03:20.742 --> 03:22.827
<i>I'd be buying you peonies, Love,</i>

03:22.911 --> 03:26.372
<i>not a plane ticket for tomorrow</i>
<i>at 9:02 a.m.</i>

03:26.456 --> 03:31.628
<i>Oh, I wish things were different.</i>
<i>But now, I have to leave. Forever.</i>

03:36.090 --> 03:40.220
<i>In another reality, I wouldn't have to lie</i>
<i>to Ellie about where her sister is.</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:42.555
<i>For both of their benefit.</i>

03:43.932 --> 03:45.516
<i>Oh, facial recognition.</i>

03:45.600 --> 03:48.937
<i>Well, big sis will be back to Ellie soon.</i>
<i>Very soon.</i>

04:07.914 --> 04:09.582
No Flamin' Hot Cheetos?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.376
You know those are my favorite.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.378
You're going to need more than that.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.547
You're gonna be in here
another 16 hours.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.716
You're leaving again?

04:19.342 --> 04:20.885
Oh, what the fuck are those?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.053
-No. Uh-uh.
-No, no no no.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.471
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Uh-uh, no.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.722
They're time-release.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.183
There's a timer. Watch.
I'll set it to three seconds.

04:27.892 --> 04:28.851
And when it's up...

04:33.147 --> 04:34.732
See? They unlock automatically.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.653
So you eat, and we cuff you to the table,

04:39.779 --> 04:43.866
and then we set the timer to go off
when I am on my way out of the city.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.785
After that, you're free.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.746
How will I get out?

04:50.331 --> 04:51.958
I'm gonna leave the doors unlocked.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.822
Once they're set,
you can't reset them till time's up.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.907
I don't want you
to drive yourself crazy

05:24.991 --> 05:26.534
trying to override the timer.

05:28.745 --> 05:29.829
There is no override.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.017
-Unlock.
-For what?

05:51.601 --> 05:52.685
For your sister.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.868
Okay.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.547
I'm leaving this here
for when you get out.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.052
I'm sorry
our friendship had to end like this.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.179
<i> She'll hate me forever,</i>

06:28.805 --> 06:31.099
<i>but she'll be fine tomorrow.</i>

06:32.225 --> 06:36.979
You have a<i> </i>severely fucked concept
of friendship.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.358
<i> Now all I have left</i>
<i>is to say goodbye</i>

06:40.441 --> 06:41.442
<i>to you.</i>

06:43.444 --> 06:46.614
Okay, so they're all gluten-free
and gastritis-friendly.

06:46.948 --> 06:50.827
-Oh, my God! The lemon. Incredible.
-Yeah? But is it perfect?

06:50.910 --> 06:52.703
How does Moroccan chocolate sound?

06:52.954 --> 06:55.706
-Like heaven in my mouth.
-Oh, yeah. Let's go with that one.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.707
But you can't just agree.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.043
What about this other recipe
I've been working on?

06:59.127 --> 07:02.547
-It's vanilla and almond and praline and--
-Love, please.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.631
Stop.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.467
What? I'm...

07:07.093 --> 07:09.387
-You just deserve the best. I'm just--
- Well, what's wrong?

07:09.470 --> 07:11.431
Is this about Milo or...?

07:14.308 --> 07:17.145
No. I mean, I was using Milo.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.021
I haven't thought about him since he left.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.983
-Will, on the other hand--
- Oh, okay.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.820
There it is.
You think you let a good one get away.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.822
No, I'm sorry.
Are we all conveniently forgetting

07:27.905 --> 07:29.907
-that he lied to you?
-No one's forgetting.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.161
But maybe he deserves a second chance.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.581
I'm a Quinn.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.084
Once burned, we tend to cut our losses
and move on.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.546
Okay. You are not your family.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.174
Your new mantra. You're welcome.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.302
If you still want the guy, go get him.

07:51.095 --> 07:53.473
-What if it's too late?
-Then he's not who you thought he was,

07:53.556 --> 07:55.975
-and in that case, boy bye.
-Yeah.

07:57.852 --> 07:58.811
Yeah, okay.

08:00.104 --> 08:00.980
Yeah.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.816
-I'm gonna do it.
-Good.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.485
Good for you. I'm proud of you, Lovebug.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.320
- You deserve it.
- Look at you. You're amazing.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.947
Yes. You're thriving.
Look at what you've done.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.450
...all three.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.452
Wait, is that
the praline one right there?

08:15.036 --> 08:15.995
Yeah...

08:16.704 --> 08:18.915
-<i> "Dear Love.</i>

08:19.665 --> 08:21.167
<i>You've changed me.</i>

08:21.626 --> 08:24.545
<i>I used to see the world as black or white.</i>

08:25.338 --> 08:29.926
<i>Now everything is gray and messy,</i>
<i>full of nuance</i>

08:30.676 --> 08:32.887
<i>and beauty because of you.</i>

08:35.139 --> 08:37.558
<i>In an alternate universe,</i>
<i>we'd still be together.</i>

08:38.434 --> 08:40.895
<i>A team. Ready for anything.</i>

08:41.479 --> 08:45.066
<i>But where I'm heading now,</i>
<i>I have to go on my own.</i>

08:45.816 --> 08:47.693
<i>I want to be the man you think I am,</i>

08:47.777 --> 08:50.905
<i>so know I am doing this</i>
<i>to do the right thing.</i>

08:50.988 --> 08:53.533
<i>And that means saying goodbye.</i>

08:54.450 --> 08:56.911
<i>Wolf you always, Joe."</i>

08:59.747 --> 09:01.999
Sport, you are not gonna believe this.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.252
-<i> I bet I'm also not gonna care.</i>
-What's that?

09:04.335 --> 09:06.963
I ran into none other
than Kathryn <i>"Hurt Locker" </i>Bigelow

09:07.046 --> 09:08.673
at Manganiello's last <i>D&D</i> night.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.259
I elevator-pitched her <i>D-FOL. </i>NBD, right?

09:11.342 --> 09:12.718
Guess who just called me.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.888
-Tell me.
-Her assistant. Okay?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.974
Apparently, Kathryn read the book

09:18.057 --> 09:20.560
after we talked,
and now she wants to see a script.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.145
She's, like, thirsty for it, dude.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.356
<i> Ugh, if I don't feign enthusiasm,</i>

09:25.439 --> 09:28.651
<i>he might burst into tears</i>
<i>or start freebasing. Or both.</i>

09:28.734 --> 09:31.404
Forty, wow. Congratulations.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.073
-It is so well-deserved.
-Right?

09:34.156 --> 09:36.701
Yeah, so we gotta get to work,
like, right now.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.827
<i> Oh, no.</i>

09:37.910 --> 09:40.621
The whole script needs a polish,
and I gotta get it to Kathryn, stat.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.165
Literally,
her assistant used the word "stat."

09:43.249 --> 09:45.585
What do you need me for?
Go over it with your manager.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.212
No, I need your genius, 30 minutes,
then go on about your whatever.

09:48.629 --> 09:51.007
<i> Timing couldn't be worse,</i>
<i>but this is important to him,</i>

09:51.090 --> 09:52.758
<i>which means important to you.</i>

09:52.842 --> 09:54.677
<i>So, my parting gift to you.</i>

09:56.137 --> 09:58.306
It's creepy when you get quiet like that.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.641
Thirty minutes, okay? That's all I have.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.644
Schweet! You're so fucking money,
and you don't even know it.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.280
So candid, I love it.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.992
<i> Wow, pedestrian.</i>

10:18.075 --> 10:20.119
-It's good, right?
-I'm still reading.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.663
<i> The truth? I don't want this movie</i>
<i>to actually get made.</i>

10:22.830 --> 10:25.791
<i>Thankfully, odds of that are worse</i>
<i>than Forty's dialogue.</i>

10:25.875 --> 10:28.544
<i>But at least I can keep him</i>
<i>from embarrassing himself.</i>

10:28.628 --> 10:32.256
Okay, there's a little exposition
in here that you don't need. Like here.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.008
You don't need Dr. Nicky to say

10:34.091 --> 10:35.760
how long he
and Beck have known each other.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.471
-They already know that.
-True, but I want to emphasize it.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.181
Why?

10:40.723 --> 10:42.224
'Cause, man, like,

10:42.308 --> 10:45.144
why should it always be the woman
keeping track of shit like that?

10:45.227 --> 10:46.479
Feminism.

10:46.562 --> 10:48.439
-What's this fuckbonnet doing?

10:49.565 --> 10:51.192
Hey, you can't park here!

10:51.275 --> 10:52.985
-It's a no-parking. I said you can't--
- What're you doing?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.320
You can't-- What are you doing?

10:54.403 --> 10:55.988
- Let me go!
-Oh! What the hell?

10:56.572 --> 10:58.199
-What're you doing? Wait!
-Unhand me, brah!

10:58.282 --> 10:59.325
-Rape!
- Wait!

10:59.408 --> 11:01.118
-Rape! I said rape!
- No!

11:01.202 --> 11:03.329
- Wait!
-Forty, shut the fuck up!

11:09.460 --> 11:13.798
<i> Fuck. Why is this happening?</i>
<i>What do I do?</i>

11:13.881 --> 11:15.966
<i>Benji, Peach, Ron, Beck,</i>
<i>Jasper, Henderson.</i>

11:16.050 --> 11:19.095
<i>Jasper goons? Salinger's?</i>
<i>Was Hendy involved in organized crime?</i>

11:19.178 --> 11:20.888
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

11:20.971 --> 11:23.933
<i> And now I've dragged this poor idiot</i>
<i>into my bullshit.</i>

11:24.684 --> 11:27.269
You have to calm down, Forty.
You have to calm down.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.396
Deep breaths.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.442
I'm so sorry, Joe. This is all my fault.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.488
What are you talking about?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.949
I'm not the man
that you think I am. I'm...

11:41.158 --> 11:42.159
I'm an addict.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.663
I know you're an addict.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.833
No, Joe. A gambling addict, okay?

11:48.916 --> 11:51.794
It's called "cross addiction"
and when it rains, it pours.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.088
I've been in the hole for months.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.465
I told them I was gonna make
the money back with this movie,

11:56.549 --> 11:57.591
but they are obviously...

11:57.675 --> 11:59.677
<i> How's this for an act one</i>
<i>turning point?</i>

11:59.844 --> 12:01.220
<i>Syd Field would be proud.</i>

12:01.303 --> 12:03.264
<i>Though if this were a movie,</i>
<i>I wouldn't believe it.</i>

12:03.347 --> 12:04.724
No more talking!

12:04.807 --> 12:09.311
<i> All this time, I've been worrying</i>
<i>that my own sins would be my undoing,</i>

12:09.395 --> 12:14.567
<i>only to be kidnapped</i>
<i>because of Forty fucking Quinn.</i>

12:20.489 --> 12:23.284
<i> As cages go, this one's, uh, posh.</i>

12:25.286 --> 12:26.787
That was a little toasty, gentlemen.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.415
Can we maybe use a more breathable hood
next time?

12:30.499 --> 12:33.169
Oh, you should see your face right now.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.135
Forty.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.180
Did you hire these men to kidnap us?

12:45.973 --> 12:47.183
It was pretty convincing, huh?

12:47.767 --> 12:50.478
I really got you with that gambling shit,
didn't I?

12:50.561 --> 12:52.480
Thank you,
Dame Helen Mirren's master class.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.732
See you at the next meeting.

12:54.815 --> 12:56.984
Yes, see you.

12:57.109 --> 13:01.030
Igor's in the program,
and he and his brother Dimitri repo cars.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.157
And I didn't think
they were gonna go for this, but...

13:03.240 --> 13:04.867
anything for the right price, I guess.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.994
This is fucking insane.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.662
Even for you.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.748
Okay, it's unconventional,

13:11.165 --> 13:13.584
but we have to break out
of our comfort zone

13:13.667 --> 13:16.629
if we are going to connect with the muse.

13:20.549 --> 13:22.176
You connect with the muse.

13:22.968 --> 13:23.844
I'm out of here.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.971
Mmm. About that...

13:26.055 --> 13:30.309
See, if either of us tries to leave,
Dimitri will shoot us.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.439
Do-- do you... even hear yourself?

13:39.109 --> 13:41.195
Dimitri don't give a fuck, bro!

13:41.278 --> 13:43.405
And B-T-dubs,
he confiscated all your shit,

13:43.489 --> 13:45.366
so you might as well just settle in.

13:47.409 --> 13:48.369
Dimitri.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.038
Can I please have that back?

13:51.121 --> 13:51.956
You...

13:52.039 --> 13:53.332
write script.

13:53.749 --> 13:54.667
Yes!

13:56.001 --> 13:56.836
Okay.

13:58.003 --> 13:58.921
Uh...

14:00.756 --> 14:04.009
You're right. I mean, it is a great idea
to connect with the muse,

14:04.468 --> 14:06.804
but I'm not very useful to you

14:07.388 --> 14:09.223
-if I'm being held hostage. Should--
-No can do.

14:09.306 --> 14:12.726
He will not let us out of here
until we have a completed script.

14:13.227 --> 14:16.522
Relax, man. Stop fighting the process.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.233
Besides,
I heard this is how Toni Morrison does it.

14:20.025 --> 14:20.860
What?

14:20.943 --> 14:23.195
She's, like, a very famous black chick
who writes books?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.114
I know who fucking Toni Morrison is.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.241
I highly doubt she writes at gunpoint!

14:27.324 --> 14:28.367
Oh, no, no no.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.161
I just meant that she writes in hotels.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.414
Forty, I didn't sign up for this!

14:33.539 --> 14:35.457
-Could you get that?

14:40.004 --> 14:42.464
-What are you doing here?
-What's all the noise about?

14:42.965 --> 14:43.799
Hey.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.803
What is she doing here?
This is not a safe environment for her.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.804
Relax, Grandpa.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.015
She's fine.
She's across the hall in um...

14:51.098 --> 14:52.975
-Suite 216.
-Yeah.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.769
And Dimitri knows that she can come
and go as she pleases.

14:55.853 --> 14:59.648
Yes, but... what's she doing here?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.526
He hired me
as your guys' writer's assistant.

15:02.610 --> 15:06.113
<i> Shit, Forty.</i>
<i>Uh... at least I can keep an eye on her.</i>

15:06.196 --> 15:09.033
I thought of everything.
This is gonna be fun. All right.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.951
Now, uh,  who wants room service?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.245
Are we eating, or are we working?

15:14.163 --> 15:15.456
<i>¿Por qué no los dos?</i>

15:16.040 --> 15:20.336
<i> This crazy, entitled, sick</i>
<i>son of a bitch.</i>

15:20.419 --> 15:22.129
<i>How has he lived this long?</i>

15:24.089 --> 15:26.884
<i>And so many accidents can happen</i>
<i>in a hotel room.</i>

15:28.260 --> 15:31.347
<i> No, no, I can do this.</i>
<i>Quickly fix the flawed script,</i>

15:31.430 --> 15:35.559
<i>get my passport, and go off to Mexico</i>
<i>before Delilah's 16-hour hold is up...</i>

15:37.269 --> 15:39.897
<i>and I leave you forever, Love.</i>

15:41.482 --> 15:43.567
<i>"Wolf you always, Joe."</i>

15:49.239 --> 15:50.282
Glad I caught you.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.743
Join me for dinner tonight.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.996
You pick the place. Just the two of us.

15:57.665 --> 16:02.294
What? Did your crackhead shaman tell you
to olive-branch me?

16:02.378 --> 16:06.256
Don't be absurd.
Shaman Open conned our entire family.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.219
Shaman Kevin, however,
is authenticity personified.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.389
And, yes, he believes
I need to mend my relationship with you.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.516
You disagree?

16:16.141 --> 16:18.978
-You need a shaman to tell you that?
-Come on, Love.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.272
I'm trying. I want us to be friends.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.944
It's essential for my growth,
and I can't imagine it would harm yours.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.747
Baby...

16:40.124 --> 16:41.083
it's okay.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.337
You need this just as much as I do,
you know?

16:47.089 --> 16:49.049
Start breaking down the walls.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.010
Let's start tonight.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.181
We'll have cocktails and dessert,
and we'll have fun.

16:57.808 --> 16:58.851
It'd be good for us.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.021
Good for the whole family.

17:04.732 --> 17:05.566
Okay, Mom.

17:13.949 --> 17:16.160
-How's the dialogue trim going?
-Already got a page off.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.495
Good. Okay, if we cut some fat
from the bottom of act two,

17:18.579 --> 17:20.581
-the flow will be much smoother.
-Dope.

17:25.335 --> 17:29.673
-What are you drinking?
-Kombexy. It's kombucha and dexedrine.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.217
Oh, it's my secret weapon
for staying focused.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.137
I'm diagnosed ADHD.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.056
Of course you are.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.099
<i> Great. The pharmacy's open again.</i>

17:39.767 --> 17:42.811
<i>I could pressure Forty</i>
<i>to face his eternal battle with sobriety,</i>

17:42.895 --> 17:44.772
<i>-but that would take time I don't have.</i>
-Boom!

17:45.355 --> 17:48.484
With Ellie's edits, we are at 118 pages.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.943
Same length as <i>The Hurt Locker.</i>

17:51.487 --> 17:52.571
Fin.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.822
<i> Oh, thank God.</i>

17:53.906 --> 17:55.074
I hit every moment.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.241
Check it, comrade.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.496
<i> Well, it's a script.</i>

18:01.038 --> 18:02.873
Who's the man, Joe? I'm the man!

18:02.956 --> 18:04.958
I'm the man! I'm the man!

18:07.211 --> 18:09.713
You look like somebody just pissed
all over your rainbow.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.590
What's wrong with her?

18:12.007 --> 18:13.675
Nothing's wrong with me.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.969
I just don't think you're done.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.138
-<i> Oh, no, no.</i>
- Say more.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.224
-First off, the script is predictable.
-Okay,

18:20.307 --> 18:21.725
I was staying true to the source material.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.811
And the female perspective
is sorely lacking.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.730
-Okay...
-<i> No.</i> <i>Ellie is too smart</i>

18:26.814 --> 18:28.941
<i>and way too honest. Shit.</i>

18:29.024 --> 18:32.069
Beck was real.
She humps a pillow multiple times!

18:33.445 --> 18:36.740
Okay, okay. What would you suggest,
Sofia Coppola?

18:36.824 --> 18:39.159
<i> Don't do it, Ellie.</i>

18:39.243 --> 18:41.453
<i>-</i>I think you should start over.
-<i> Fuck.</i>

18:41.537 --> 18:45.499
Figure out who Beck really is
and why you're the one to tell her story.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.627
That seems a bit drastic.

18:48.710 --> 18:52.172
Let's not--
Look, let's do a quick Beck pass, huh?

18:52.589 --> 18:55.008
It's gonna need more than a quick pass.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.386
Forty, where are you going?

18:57.845 --> 18:59.221
I gotta get out of here.

18:59.763 --> 19:02.307
Oh, great. Well, let's tell Dimitri
we're making a change of--

19:03.100 --> 19:03.976
Forty, stop.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.310
Wait, stop! What?

19:05.394 --> 19:06.478
-What?!

19:15.571 --> 19:17.573
He does not handle criticism very well.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.950
<i> If I lose him,</i>
<i>I'll never get my passport back.</i>

19:20.033 --> 19:21.326
<i>Smash cut to apocalypse.</i>

19:21.410 --> 19:23.287
Okay, go back to your room,

19:23.370 --> 19:25.914
order all the food you want,
and go to bed.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.500
I can't tell if you're a worse producer
or babysitter.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.169
Just don't leave.

19:30.752 --> 19:31.628
Ah.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.886
White male fragility.

19:55.402 --> 19:59.281
<i> Six bars and finally...</i>

20:02.868 --> 20:05.370
-Got something against the hotel bar?
-It was too stuffy for me.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.372
And also, I was blacklisted.

20:08.832 --> 20:09.917
Got you a seltzer.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.627
Figured you'd find me.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.212
You're just like that.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.548
Are these all you?

20:16.632 --> 20:19.968
I politely requested
a bottle of tequila,

20:20.385 --> 20:22.846
but the asshole bartender
wouldn't sell it to me,

20:22.930 --> 20:25.891
so I had to buy it shot by shot.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.478
<i> How high is his tolerance?</i>
<i>How is he alive?</i>

20:29.937 --> 20:32.648
<i>I can't imagine what it's been like</i>
<i>to watch this slow suicide</i>

20:32.731 --> 20:33.982
<i>year after year.</i>

20:34.066 --> 20:36.944
-Why don't we go back to the hotel room?
-She's right, you know.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.196
I don't know dick about writing women.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.782
It <i>is </i>predictable, and it's not...

20:42.741 --> 20:43.742
special.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.870
<i> Do not let this escalate.</i>

20:47.246 --> 20:48.830
<i>Talk him off the ledge.</i>

20:48.914 --> 20:50.749
-You're talented.
-I'm a loser.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.085
I'm such a loser,

20:53.168 --> 20:56.463
I'm still texting the girl
who used the fuck out of me.

20:57.464 --> 20:59.007
What girl? What are you talking about?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.969
-You're not talking about--
-Amy. Sorry, Candace...

21:02.052 --> 21:03.720
or whatever her name is today.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.057
<i> He's still in touch with Candace?</i>

21:07.140 --> 21:09.768
-Why are you two still talking?
-Closure.

21:10.894 --> 21:13.647
She wants it. And I do too, I guess.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.607
-<i> This can't be happening.</i>
-God!

21:15.691 --> 21:19.152
Why can't I just meet, like, a nice girl

21:19.236 --> 21:20.279
like Jessica Alba,

21:20.362 --> 21:23.782
who won't lie to me,
and who just wants to have my babies

21:23.865 --> 21:25.534
and love me forever?

21:25.993 --> 21:29.288
Like... is that-- is that too much to ask?

21:29.371 --> 21:31.456
Of course not. You deserve that.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.793
-Candace is not that. No more texting.
-That's what I want.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.586
That's it.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.546
Yes.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.590
-Attention, everybody! Excuse me.
-Forty, stop.

21:40.674 --> 21:41.967
Attention, everyone.

21:43.010 --> 21:46.096
Congratu-fucking-lations, you two.
Get over here.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.347
Come here.

21:48.348 --> 21:51.018
I am feeling particularly generous
this evening,

21:51.435 --> 21:54.271
and there is nothing sweeter in the world
than newlyweds.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.023
So here is my proposal.

21:56.106 --> 22:00.277
I will give the happy couple ten grand
in cash...

22:00.360 --> 22:02.029
- Wow.
- Are you serious?

22:02.112 --> 22:04.197
...if this handsome groom...

22:04.948 --> 22:07.576
will let me kiss his beautiful bride.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.662
Forty, let's get some coffee.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.166
<i> How dark is he going to get?</i>

22:14.708 --> 22:17.544
-I don't like this.
-I know, but we can pay the mortgage down.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.588
<i> Maybe he'll let it go.</i>

22:20.839 --> 22:21.798
<i>No.</i>

22:22.424 --> 22:24.217
<i>He enjoys this.</i>

22:25.010 --> 22:26.386
<i>He's a sadist.</i>

22:35.645 --> 22:36.772
Hoo!

22:37.230 --> 22:39.149
<i> And before it's even begun...</i>

22:39.232 --> 22:41.902
-Enjoy it.
-<i> ...Forty has ruined their marriage.</i>

22:42.235 --> 22:45.030
<i>I've seen Forty the addict,</i>
<i>Forty the braggart,</i>

22:45.489 --> 22:47.741
<i>the crybaby, the manipulator.</i>

22:48.533 --> 22:50.452
<i>But I've never seen this side.</i>

22:51.328 --> 22:53.997
<i>Your brother, Love, is dangerous.</i>

22:56.208 --> 22:57.084
Get me a drink.

22:57.167 --> 23:00.337
No. We're going back to the hotel.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.506
<i> Get my passport, escape.</i>

23:02.589 --> 23:04.674
You're coming with me, or don't,

23:05.675 --> 23:06.551
but I'm done.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.805
Wait. Wait.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.684
What... are you doing... now?

23:15.435 --> 23:18.647
Since you're leaving me forever,

23:18.730 --> 23:21.316
that is the time
you started drinking your seltzer,

23:21.900 --> 23:26.071
and it's going to be very important
to you later

23:26.154 --> 23:30.283
when you don't know where
or when the fuck you are.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.328
Why wouldn't I know those things?

23:33.453 --> 23:35.288
Oh...

23:35.914 --> 23:40.419
I kinda definitely dosed
your seltzer water with LSD.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.003
<i> He's joking.</i>

23:42.087 --> 23:43.046
<i>He has to be.</i>

23:43.130 --> 23:46.133
I just felt like we really needed this

23:46.216 --> 23:48.593
if we were gonna have
a breakthrough tonight.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.221
You drugged me?

23:51.304 --> 23:54.266
Yeah. And I didn't know
how much you'd trip,

23:54.349 --> 23:56.852
so I just gave you
four times the usual dose

23:56.935 --> 23:58.228
to make sure that it would work.

23:58.311 --> 24:01.148
I've never taken acid before in my life.

24:03.108 --> 24:03.942
Oh...

24:05.485 --> 24:07.237
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.781
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just three rules.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.658
One, cars are real.

24:11.741 --> 24:15.036
Two, anything you want to try,
please do it from the ground first.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.582
And three, if you cannot stop sobbing,
just drink a Moon Juice.

24:22.836 --> 24:27.924
Okay, sport. You gotta be careful
'cause you're about to feel everything.

24:28.008 --> 24:31.052
<i> All I feel is rage.</i>

24:31.344 --> 24:34.514
<i>I tried, Love,</i>
<i>but your brother's a lost cause.</i>

24:39.978 --> 24:41.980
Hey. Let's get a selfie.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.941
-Do we have to?
-Yes, why not?

24:46.401 --> 24:47.235
Okay.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.197
-Nice.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.286
So, is this what you had in mind?

24:56.703 --> 24:59.331
Skin care advice and selfies?

25:03.001 --> 25:04.461
Your father's cheating again.

25:05.754 --> 25:06.755
Oh.

25:06.922 --> 25:07.881
But it's fine.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.591
Or it will be fine

25:10.175 --> 25:13.678
once you, me, and Forty remind him
what an incredible family he has.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.974
You know, him seeing us together here
is gonna make him very happy.

25:19.392 --> 25:20.435
Wow.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.729
Seven likes already.

25:24.272 --> 25:27.651
Anyway, Forty's clean and working.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.861
I have a healthy libido still.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.488
Fuck you, menopause.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.699
And, you know,
everything would be picture perfect

25:34.783 --> 25:36.618
if you hadn't let Will slip away.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.954
But <i>c'est la vie.</i>

25:39.663 --> 25:41.957
-Anyway, we all have our part to play.
-No.

25:42.874 --> 25:45.961
-Excuse me?
-No, I'm sick of us always pretending.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.840
You pretending
that Dad's cheating doesn't hurt you.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.136
Or that Forty isn't a walking time bomb.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.724
No, instead you just slap
a Shaman Kevin Band-Aid on it.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.102
That's not true.
You're completely off base.

26:02.185 --> 26:05.772
Oh, like I was off base about you sweeping
the <i>au pair</i> incident under the rug?

26:07.691 --> 26:08.900
You've had too much to drink.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.111
What that woman did to Forty was criminal.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.030
Then what did you do?
Oh, yeah, I remember.

26:14.114 --> 26:15.824
A sage smudge.

26:15.949 --> 26:18.326
-She should've gone to jail!
-It was impossible.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.162
You pretended like it wasn't happening
until it was too late.

26:21.246 --> 26:23.498
-He's your son!
-I did what I had to do!

26:32.841 --> 26:35.135
You know,
I love this family unconditionally,

26:35.218 --> 26:36.344
-and I will do--
-I know...

26:37.053 --> 26:38.930
what unconditional love feels like.

26:42.767 --> 26:43.977
This is not it.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.617
<i> Wikipedia says kick-in times</i>
<i>are variable.</i>

26:58.700 --> 27:01.328
<i>This trip's gonna last, oh,</i>
<i>nine to 16 hours.</i>

27:01.411 --> 27:05.123
<i>So getting my passport back quick</i>
<i>without Forty's help is job one.</i>

27:05.957 --> 27:08.501
<i>I'll have to deal with Dimitri on my own.</i>

27:08.585 --> 27:10.754
<i>Question is, where is he?</i>

27:10.837 --> 27:14.424
<i>If only I hadn't been brought here</i>
<i>in a hood and jumped out the window.</i>

27:16.301 --> 27:19.137
<i>Am I tripping, or is that you?</i>

27:19.888 --> 27:20.930
Hey, you.

27:22.557 --> 27:25.352
<i> Well, you smell a little drunk,</i>
<i>honestly.</i>

27:25.435 --> 27:26.978
What are you doing here?

27:27.437 --> 27:28.355
Um...

27:28.938 --> 27:31.858
I was hoping that I would run into you.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.443
Forty mentioned

27:33.526 --> 27:36.363
that he might be writing here
this weekend.

27:36.988 --> 27:41.368
I saw you on his Instagram this afternoon,
and I put two and two together.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.870
<i> I'm gonna miss how smart you are.</i>

27:43.953 --> 27:45.163
That letter you wrote...

27:47.749 --> 27:49.959
it shattered me.

27:52.295 --> 27:53.713
Are you really leaving LA?

27:54.214 --> 27:57.092
<i> Your sadness, disappointment in me.</i>

27:57.967 --> 27:59.678
<i>The goodbye I wanted to avoid.</i>

28:00.387 --> 28:01.262
Okay, well,

28:01.346 --> 28:02.806
if you have to leave,

28:05.308 --> 28:06.309
meet me tomorrow.

28:08.019 --> 28:10.188
For lunch, okay?

28:10.689 --> 28:12.607
You know, we've been through a lot...

28:14.025 --> 28:17.070
in such a short period of time,
and I care about you.

28:17.153 --> 28:19.114
<i> Oh, no.</i>

28:19.572 --> 28:22.283
Can we just meet for one more lunch?

28:22.367 --> 28:24.327
<i> Shit. It's kicking in.</i>

28:24.411 --> 28:26.579
<i>This is not how I want to remember you.</i>

28:26.663 --> 28:27.664
Oh...

28:28.081 --> 28:29.666
-Okay.
- <i>What? No.</i>

28:29.749 --> 28:31.167
-I understand.
-<i> Speak.</i>

28:31.459 --> 28:32.460
No.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.549
Love, Love.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.845
Come here. It's in your hair, sweetie.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.932
-I'm so sorry if she called you.
-I drank.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.017
My daughter's having one
of her drama queen days.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.186
- I'm sorry.
-<i> I see it now.</i>

28:50.270 --> 28:51.771
-I'm sorry.
-Let's go get cleaned up.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.106
<i> Your mother's a demon,</i>

28:53.189 --> 28:55.108
<i>dragging you to hell with her.</i>

28:55.775 --> 28:57.902
<i>I have to rescue you from her.</i>

28:58.361 --> 29:01.114
<i> Four hits of acid.</i>

29:01.489 --> 29:02.532
<i>It's okay.</i>

29:02.615 --> 29:03.658
<i>It's all in my mind.</i>

29:04.159 --> 29:06.870
<i>-I've ridden harder rides.</i>
- Where are we going?

29:10.165 --> 29:11.791
<i> Is that me?</i>

29:12.041 --> 29:14.335
<i>Is my intuition telling me to go that way,</i>

29:14.419 --> 29:16.379
<i>or is every horror fan in the universe</i>

29:16.463 --> 29:19.632
<i>currently screaming</i>
<i>at me not to follow the creepy kid?</i>

29:21.593 --> 29:22.802
<i>Did I teleport or--</i>

29:23.219 --> 29:25.722
<i>No, it's acid.</i>
<i>This is a Grateful Dead concert.</i>

29:26.055 --> 29:27.724
<i>I love you, Love.</i>

29:27.974 --> 29:29.184
<i>I'll get through this.</i>

29:32.437 --> 29:35.190
<i>Candace? No. Deadhead concert.</i>

29:35.273 --> 29:36.775
Very bad writer.

29:44.532 --> 29:48.119
I'm sorry tonight didn't turn out
as you expected.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.747
I swear I didn't mean to upset you.

29:51.080 --> 29:54.000
We just...
never talk about the right things.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.296
If I did such a horrible job,
how'd you turn out so well?

29:59.756 --> 30:01.132
Oh, you're biased.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.384
Or you're lying.

30:04.093 --> 30:05.220
I never lie to you.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.014
You're the only other Quinn
who can handle the truth.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.601
I know I can be hard on you sometimes,

30:12.352 --> 30:14.938
and that's because you're strong, like me.

30:17.106 --> 30:19.359
I really do see so much of myself in you.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.615
One day you'll have children,
and you'll understand.

30:26.491 --> 30:27.784
When they need you,

30:28.409 --> 30:30.161
like you need me right now,

30:31.120 --> 30:32.997
it's no longer so hard to love them.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.085
I'm gonna get us our suite.

30:37.752 --> 30:39.838
Meet me up there whenever you're ready.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.981
<i>Joey! Joey! Joey.</i>

30:58.314 --> 30:59.524
-Mom?

30:59.649 --> 31:02.360
Hey. Welcome back, Mr. Producer.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.363
Your mom's not here, but use that.

31:13.663 --> 31:14.581
Ellie was right.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.543
The whole thing needs to be
from Beck's perspective.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.045
What does Beck want?

31:21.129 --> 31:24.257
What did Beck feel?
What did Beck dream about?

31:24.507 --> 31:25.466
Beck,

31:25.550 --> 31:29.888
the poor girl who lost her life
to give us this story,

31:29.971 --> 31:33.141
what was she searching for
in that sea of men?

31:33.224 --> 31:35.268
We need to see her, Joe!

31:35.351 --> 31:39.022
-Beck! Come on, man! Think!
-Beck! Come on, Joe! Think!

31:39.105 --> 31:40.189
<i> I think I'm dead.</i>

31:40.273 --> 31:43.401
<i>He poisoned me,</i>
<i>and I died, and this is my hell.</i>

31:44.319 --> 31:47.405
I need to become Beck.

31:47.739 --> 31:51.034
<i> I need the earth to split open</i>
<i>and swallow me whole.</i>

31:51.117 --> 31:52.118
Let's role-play.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.995
You be Dr. Nicky, I'll be GB.

31:54.913 --> 31:55.997
-I can't.
-Come on.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.503
I was your patient.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.839
Why did you take advantage of me?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.674
<i> I am not doing this.</i>

32:06.758 --> 32:08.551
Why did you take advantage of me?

32:08.635 --> 32:11.387
-I was trying to help you.
-I needed a therapist,

32:11.471 --> 32:16.392
not some psychotic asshole posing
as Prince Charming.

32:17.018 --> 32:17.894
Okay.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.855
-I hear you.
-What gives you the right?

32:20.939 --> 32:23.274
-You thought that I would be grateful?
-<i> ...grateful?</i>

32:23.358 --> 32:24.651
Your life was a mess!

32:24.734 --> 32:26.194
Yes, but it was <i>my </i>life!

32:26.277 --> 32:29.530
-And I didn't need some sociopath...
<i>-</i> <i>And I didn't need some...</i>

32:29.614 --> 32:32.367
-...on a white horse to clean the house.
-We can't do this!

32:32.784 --> 32:33.952
Come on, Joe, do it.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.579
-Choke me. Do it. Don't be a pussy hat.
-Forty, I can't do this!

32:36.663 --> 32:39.540
-You're not special. You're broken.
- <i>You're not special. You're broken.</i>

32:40.041 --> 32:43.044
<i> I could never love you.</i>
<i>You are the bad thing.</i>

32:43.711 --> 32:46.381
<i>You are the thing</i>
<i>that you should have killed.</i>

32:48.591 --> 32:49.550
Do it.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.152
Wow. That was, like, um...

33:08.736 --> 33:11.781
Joaquin-level method. Way to s--
Way to commit.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.157
Respect.

33:13.783 --> 33:14.826
Oh...

33:15.451 --> 33:18.705
Okay, okay. Uh-oh. Crying.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.333
You know what that means.
Rule number three,

33:22.917 --> 33:24.627
we're just gonna drink
some Moon Juice, okay?

33:24.711 --> 33:28.047
What fucking Moon Juice?
We don't have any Moon Juice.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.425
-Shh, shh, shh.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.093
You're gonna go to Anavrin,

33:32.760 --> 33:34.303
you're gonna buy some Moon Juice.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.681
Maybe some cassava chips,

33:37.765 --> 33:39.517
some dried apple slices.

33:39.600 --> 33:40.977
What about Dimitri?

33:43.604 --> 33:45.606
"Mama Ru" is the safe word.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.984
If you just say that, he'll let you out.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.323
There's been a fucking safe word?

33:55.116 --> 33:56.284
Of course.

33:56.784 --> 34:00.246
I'm not a crazy person. All right?

34:00.663 --> 34:02.415
But we can only use it once,

34:03.207 --> 34:04.876
-so make it count.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.795
I wou-- Oh.
I would come with you, but, um...

34:08.963 --> 34:11.049
I think I'm peaking.

34:12.550 --> 34:13.801
You can do this, Joe!

34:16.054 --> 34:18.431
Mama Ru! Mama Ru!

34:24.812 --> 34:28.024
<i> What? How the hell did I get here?</i>

34:28.900 --> 34:31.486
<i>Is this the hotel room?</i>

34:32.528 --> 34:35.823
<i>Did I leave and come back? Or--</i>

34:37.075 --> 34:38.701
<i>What in the hell?</i>

34:49.545 --> 34:54.592
<i>Was the blood real? Did I wash it off?</i>
<i>Is it on my shirt? Was that really there?</i>

34:54.675 --> 34:56.928
<i>What is even real?</i>

34:58.638 --> 35:01.974
<i>How long was I gone and what did I do?</i>

35:03.434 --> 35:05.937
<i>Grocery bags. That is a clue.</i>

35:10.441 --> 35:12.944
Good. You stopped crying.
What did I tell you?

35:13.361 --> 35:14.445
Moon Juice is the shit.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.782
-Did I leave this room?
-Yeah.

35:18.366 --> 35:21.702
Where do you think all this came from?
Feeling good about Beck now.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.248
When you were, um... strangling me,
I really got it.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.917
<i> I don't have a car, so...</i>

35:28.209 --> 35:29.669
How did I get to Anavrin?

35:30.503 --> 35:31.838
Or back?

35:31.921 --> 35:33.256
How should I know?

35:33.339 --> 35:35.758
I am breaking story, brah.

35:35.842 --> 35:39.679
I'm, like, balls deep
in Dr. Nicky's psyche over here.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.348
How do you think Dr. Nicky
hid his sociopathy for so long?

35:42.431 --> 35:43.641
How long was I gone?

35:43.724 --> 35:46.644
-Answer my question, I'll answer yours.
-Why does he have to be a sociopath?

35:46.727 --> 35:49.647
Maybe he's a man
who would do anything for love.

35:49.939 --> 35:52.400
Your turn. How long was I gone?

35:52.483 --> 35:53.442
About an hour.

35:53.901 --> 35:56.529
<i> Not enough time to get all this</i>
<i>and do something bad.</i>

35:56.612 --> 35:57.655
Or three.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.659
Difficult to say. I was in flow.
Somewhere between one and three hours.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.913
-You're getting that look again.
-What look?

36:05.997 --> 36:08.082
That weird panicky look you had
when you came in.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.501
You kept saying
there was blood on your hands.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.420
-Was there?
-Couldn't say.

36:12.503 --> 36:15.673
Yeah. Every time I looked at your hands,
all I could see was lobsters.

36:15.798 --> 36:17.216
<i>Who else might've seen me?</i>

36:17.341 --> 36:18.676
<i> Dimitri.</i>

36:34.025 --> 36:35.359
Dinner break. What?

36:38.821 --> 36:41.324
When I came back from the store,
did I have anything on my hands?

36:42.158 --> 36:43.451
No. Hands clean.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.453
Go write.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.872
<i> Okay. This is good. Hands clean.</i>

36:47.955 --> 36:49.207
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

36:49.290 --> 36:51.751
<i>On track. Mexico City. 9:02 a.m.</i>

36:51.834 --> 36:53.586
<i>-Your ringtone, Love.</i>

36:53.669 --> 36:55.421
<i>I need to make sure you're okay.</i>

36:55.504 --> 36:56.339
I need my phone.

36:57.423 --> 36:59.634
-No phone.
-Man, it's important!

36:59.717 --> 37:01.177
No phone!

37:01.260 --> 37:02.470
I'm trying to work!

37:06.933 --> 37:07.934
You're welcome.

37:09.852 --> 37:10.728
Thank you.

37:21.822 --> 37:22.865
<i> Be normal.</i>

37:23.908 --> 37:24.909
<i>I'm normal.</i>

37:31.624 --> 37:33.167
-Hey you.
<i>-Hey.</i>

37:34.377 --> 37:36.629
<i>You look terrible. Are you in a bathroom?</i>

37:37.838 --> 37:39.298
Yeah, I-- I, uh...

37:40.675 --> 37:41.676
I'm-- I'm sorry...

37:43.469 --> 37:46.264
if I seemed weird earlier

37:46.347 --> 37:47.348
<i>in the hall.</i>

37:48.349 --> 37:49.308
<i>I was...</i>

37:50.601 --> 37:52.103
<i>overwhelmed saying goodbye.</i>

37:52.979 --> 37:56.148
No. That's why I'm calling. Okay?

37:56.524 --> 37:57.441
Listen to me.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.237
No to goodbye.

38:02.321 --> 38:05.032
I refuse your goodbye.

38:05.950 --> 38:09.829
You are the first thing in so long
that has felt right.

38:10.913 --> 38:15.001
Now, I grew up with toxic,
conditional love, and I am done.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.879
I forgive your stupid lie.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.339
I just-- I want to be with you.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.842
<i>I want a life with you.</i>

38:23.759 --> 38:24.635
<i>Do you...</i>

38:25.219 --> 38:26.345
want that, too?

38:27.930 --> 38:28.848
Yes.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.685
<i>More than anything!</i>

38:33.602 --> 38:34.437
Okay.

38:35.688 --> 38:39.150
Whatever you're running from,
we can figure it out together.

38:42.236 --> 38:44.030
<i> If only that were true.</i>

38:44.113 --> 38:46.407
<i>Once Delilah's free, we can't be here.</i>

38:46.490 --> 38:47.325
Um...

38:47.867 --> 38:49.118
What if we...

38:50.036 --> 38:51.370
<i>What if we leave together?</i>

38:52.371 --> 38:53.372
<i>Start over.</i>

38:54.123 --> 38:55.207
<i>Just the two of us.</i>

38:56.292 --> 38:59.211
<i>Away from your parents.</i>
<i>You could finish cooking school in Paris.</i>

38:59.795 --> 39:01.464
Or anywhere. Anywhere you want.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.342
Wow, that sounds amazing, but...

39:06.344 --> 39:07.595
<i>what about Forty?</i>

39:08.512 --> 39:11.098
<i>I can't... leave him with them.</i>

39:12.433 --> 39:13.351
Um...

39:14.727 --> 39:17.605
<i>Yeah. Of course.</i>

39:18.105 --> 39:21.484
We'll take Forty with us wherever we go.

39:22.818 --> 39:24.028
<i>Thank you.</i>

39:24.195 --> 39:25.696
<i>Thank you.</i>

39:26.072 --> 39:27.740
I am so happy.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.702
<i>I can't wait. Okay.</i>
<i>Will you meet me tomorrow morning?</i>

39:32.661 --> 39:33.579
Um...

39:33.871 --> 39:35.373
I have something to tend to.

39:36.624 --> 39:37.625
But then I'm yours.

39:39.293 --> 39:40.753
<i>I wolf you.</i>

39:41.337 --> 39:42.505
I wolf you more.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.099
<i> This night does have a silver lining</i>

39:53.182 --> 39:54.725
<i>We will make it work.</i>

39:54.809 --> 39:57.103
<i>I'll negotiate with Delilah,</i>

39:57.186 --> 39:59.605
<i>buy her silence.</i>
<i>We will be in another country.</i>

39:59.688 --> 40:01.816
<i>We won't have to look over our shoulders.</i>

40:01.899 --> 40:03.818
<i>Forty, we'll, uh, figure that one out.</i>

40:03.901 --> 40:05.986
<i>Everything is going to be all right.</i>

40:06.362 --> 40:07.363
Joey...

40:18.916 --> 40:20.126
There you are.

40:21.585 --> 40:25.589
-You gave Mommy a scare.
- <i>You are not here. This isn't real.</i>

40:25.673 --> 40:26.882
Oh, Joey...

40:26.966 --> 40:30.469
Do you really think your love story
is gonna have a happy ending?

40:36.475 --> 40:38.602
-Stop.
-People like us don't change.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.021
I've changed.

40:41.105 --> 40:45.109
Then why are you already thinking of ways
to get rid of Forty?

40:45.192 --> 40:46.861
I'm not. I haven't been.

40:46.944 --> 40:50.448
So many accidents that can happen
in a hotel room, can't they?

40:53.617 --> 40:56.662
-You're not real. I'm not gonna--
-Of course

40:57.246 --> 40:58.414
you're gonna kill him.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.207
Just like Delilah.

41:00.332 --> 41:02.710
It was a done deal
once you threw her in that cage.

41:03.711 --> 41:04.712
She's already dead.

41:05.796 --> 41:06.797
You're wrong.

41:07.673 --> 41:08.841
I let Will out.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.302
And I'm gonna let Delilah out.

41:13.345 --> 41:14.263
I've changed.

41:17.725 --> 41:18.809
Are you sure?

41:30.321 --> 41:31.155
Forty.

41:33.032 --> 41:33.949
Are they real?

41:35.159 --> 41:36.660
Are my hands-- Are--

41:39.455 --> 41:40.581
<i>Whoa.</i>

41:41.916 --> 41:42.958
I figured it out.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.340
And you were right. It wasn't sociopathy.

41:49.798 --> 41:53.636
It was a crime of passion
by someone who loved her.

41:54.011 --> 41:55.846
<i>Where is he going with this?</i>

41:56.847 --> 41:58.682
But Dr. Nicky didn't love her.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.644
She was just his side piece.

42:03.103 --> 42:04.855
Her ex-boyfriend loved her, though.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.609
What ex-boyfriend?

42:08.692 --> 42:10.861
She mentions him a few times in the book.

42:11.111 --> 42:13.364
Casually. Never even by name.

42:14.740 --> 42:15.741
He seems harmless.

42:17.493 --> 42:20.663
But he murdered her in a jealous rage,
and he framed Dr. Nicky.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.876
Nobody suspected him, though.

42:26.835 --> 42:29.255
He's just a... normal guy.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.507
Like you or...

42:32.883 --> 42:33.717
me.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.888
You want to know how I figured it out?

42:43.435 --> 42:44.770
It's okay, baby.

42:52.027 --> 42:53.070
I'll forgive you.

42:56.156 --> 42:58.117
I'll tell you how I know.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.286
Because it's exactly what I did.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.044
I was in love with Sofia,

43:10.421 --> 43:11.338
our <i>au pair.</i>

43:12.923 --> 43:16.385
My parents said I was too young,
but... I wasn't.

43:18.387 --> 43:19.388
I loved her.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.515
And she loved me.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.351
It wasn't just some dumb crush.

43:28.731 --> 43:29.607
It was love.

43:31.734 --> 43:34.570
When I found out she was seeing
some college guy,

43:37.656 --> 43:40.284
I felt this rage inside of me.

43:40.868 --> 43:45.914
Like an animal made of teeth and of fire.

43:47.541 --> 43:48.876
And I blacked out.

43:51.795 --> 43:53.464
And I killed her.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.927
I came to,
and I was standing over her.

44:00.429 --> 44:04.391
My parents made it look like a suicide.
Made it go away.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.189
Do you know...

44:11.482 --> 44:13.192
how painful it's been?

44:14.068 --> 44:16.362
Carrying around a secret like that?

44:17.571 --> 44:19.365
<i> More than he'll ever know.</i>

44:22.159 --> 44:23.452
You were just a kid.

44:25.079 --> 44:26.413
A confused kid.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.667
You're forgiven.

44:32.836 --> 44:34.922
You don't think I'm a monster?

44:35.631 --> 44:36.548
No.

44:39.343 --> 44:40.844
I think you have a bright future.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.806
<i>And on acid, at least,</i>
<i>he's a savant.</i>

44:44.264 --> 44:46.016
What you just pitched to me,

44:49.436 --> 44:50.688
it's a great movie.

44:52.147 --> 44:53.357
I think you should write it.

44:53.857 --> 44:55.275
You should fictionalize it.

44:55.359 --> 44:57.528
<i>Taking as many liberties</i>
as possible.

44:57.653 --> 44:58.821
You should write it.

45:03.909 --> 45:05.911
Um...

45:07.246 --> 45:12.835
I, um... don't know what's going on
between you and my sister, but...

45:15.212 --> 45:17.673
she would be crazy to let you go.

45:21.719 --> 45:23.178
I think we're gonna make it.

45:48.579 --> 45:50.038
<i> It's been 11 hours.</i>

45:50.414 --> 45:52.624
<i>Most of it must be out of my system</i>
<i>by now.</i>

45:52.708 --> 45:53.834
<i>And there's still time.</i>

45:55.919 --> 45:58.464
<i>I'm sober and free.</i>

46:01.216 --> 46:02.092
Forty?

46:05.012 --> 46:07.389
<i> Let's, uh, hope</i>
<i>he just went out for coffee.</i>

46:10.392 --> 46:12.352
<i>Come on, Ellie, I don't have time.</i>

46:14.938 --> 46:16.190
-What?
-Hey, um,

46:16.273 --> 46:18.358
do you think you could get yourself home?

46:18.776 --> 46:20.736
Can I pick up my phone
and request an Uber?

46:21.862 --> 46:23.822
Yeah, I think I can manage that.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.657
Okay, great. Well, see--

46:25.741 --> 46:29.036
<i> Now, I just have to get to Delilah</i>
<i>before those cuffs open up.</i>

46:29.870 --> 46:31.246
<i>In another reality,</i>

46:31.330 --> 46:33.415
<i>I'd be heading to the airport, but...</i>

46:34.166 --> 46:37.586
<i>I'm rewriting our movie, Love,</i>
<i>because of you.</i>

46:37.669 --> 46:40.130
<i>The hero races to the cage,</i>

46:40.214 --> 46:45.219
<i>he raises the door, and steps inside,</i>
<i>eager to set Delilah free,</i>

46:46.261 --> 46:48.555
<i>and begin the rest of his life.</i>
