00:12.429 --> 00:17.901
Right now, terrorists are plotting
to assassinate a presidential candidate.

00:18.302 --> 00:21.238
My wife and daughter have been kidnapped.

00:21.438 --> 00:25.376
And people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.576 --> 00:27.611
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer.

00:27.811 --> 00:30.381
This, is the longest day of my life.

00:55.721 --> 00:56.856
Take the next exit.

00:57.056 --> 00:59.725
- Plesarita Canyon Road?
- Yeah.

01:00.676 --> 01:02.528
How much further is this place?

01:02.728 --> 01:05.230
I told you I'd take you to
your family, and I will.

01:05.731 --> 01:06.366
That was the deal.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.235
You'd better hope my wife
and daughter are still alive.

01:09.435 --> 01:10.520
That's the deal.

01:20.163 --> 01:23.549
I'm sure my being here
has been a big adjustment.

01:23.749 --> 01:27.653
I appreciate the hard work and long
hours you're all putting in.

01:27.853 --> 01:31.757
There's a high probability that
Senator Palmer is still in danger...

01:32.258 --> 01:34.710
...but we are making progress
on several fronts.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.781
Our most promising lead
continues to be Jack Bauer.

01:54.981 --> 01:58.784
Local and federal law enforcement
have made finding him a priority.

01:58.984 --> 02:02.788
We're also trying to locate the man
who impersonated a photographer...

02:03.289 --> 02:05.232
...at the Senator's appearance this morning.

02:05.432 --> 02:07.176
This man may have been involved with Bauer.

02:07.376 --> 02:11.297
I've told the agencies we're working with
that they can expect full cooperation...

02:11.497 --> 02:12.298
...from all of us.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.303
Hopefully we can repair
some of the damage...

02:17.803 --> 02:19.755
...caused by Bauer's recent actions.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.807
Thank you. That's all.

02:29.815 --> 02:31.617
- Bauer.
- Jack.

02:31.817 --> 02:33.653
You were right. Kevin Carroll showed up.

02:33.853 --> 02:35.621
He gave us the information
we've been looking for.

02:35.821 --> 02:38.658
I'm on my way to where Teri
and Kim are being held now.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.126
Where?

02:40.326 --> 02:44.030
Somewhere in the North Valley, east
of the 5, between Tampa and Reseda.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.132
I'm coming up on some orange groves now.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.335
Look I need you to Activate the GPS function
on the Palm Pilot that you sent me.

02:49.535 --> 02:52.138
I need satellite photos so that
I can see what I'm going into.

02:52.338 --> 02:56.842
Make sure that they're hi-res. I need be
able to identify structures and personnel.

02:57.042 --> 02:59.679
Okay, I'm gonna need time
to download off the satellite.

02:59.879 --> 03:01.147
It won't be a fresh image.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.349
Alright, give me what you can. I'll wait.

03:03.549 --> 03:05.351
- Jack?
- What?

03:05.851 --> 03:10.005
Green... she's still squeezing
everyone here to bring you in.

03:10.205 --> 03:14.360
I will turn myself in as soon
as I know my family is safe.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.362
She thinks I've been in contact with you.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.164
Deny it. I'll back you up
as soon as I can.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.366
Nina look, I know you put
yourself on the line here.

03:20.566 --> 03:22.368
No one's twisting my arm.
I've got to go.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.874
Excuse me.

03:30.876 --> 03:32.178
- Was that Jack?
- Yeah.

03:32.378 --> 03:33.879
- Where is he?
- In the North Valley.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.948
He's closing in on Teri and Kim.

03:36.148 --> 03:37.717
You gonna tell Green about this?

03:37.883 --> 03:39.385
Not until he gets them out.

03:39.585 --> 03:41.387
What if he can't?

03:42.388 --> 03:45.691
I'm gonna have to live with my mistake.

03:45.891 --> 03:48.794
Tony, I appreciate your looking
the other way on this...

03:48.994 --> 03:51.897
...but you don't have to help
me cover for Jack anymore.

03:52.097 --> 03:53.899
I'm not doing this for Jack.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.409
I'll have that confirmed
in five minutes.

04:03.909 --> 04:05.911
It will be downloaded to your computer.

04:26.766 --> 04:30.436
Kimberly, he tried to kill us.

04:31.937 --> 04:33.939
I didn't have a choice.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.944
Taking a person's life,
believe me... I feel sick.

04:39.144 --> 04:41.947
That's just it, Mom.
I don't feel bad at all.

04:42.147 --> 04:44.950
I don't feel anything
except happy he's dead.

04:47.953 --> 04:49.955
They're looking for him.

05:05.971 --> 05:08.974
We have to get out of
here before they find him.

05:09.174 --> 05:10.476
Cover up the blood.

05:19.985 --> 05:22.988
Yeah, that's right, man.
No time for this.

05:25.991 --> 05:28.127
There's two of them.

05:28.327 --> 05:30.496
When they're gone, we'll move.

06:02.027 --> 06:02.945
Nina?

06:03.529 --> 06:06.065
I've got the satellite photos,
but they're a few hours old.

06:06.265 --> 06:07.533
Hold on.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.039
- Okay, I'm ready to receive.
- Are you there yet?

06:14.239 --> 06:16.342
I'm just outside the perimeter.

06:16.542 --> 06:20.546
I see a dozen or so people on the ground.
Some look like they're carrying weapons.

06:20.746 --> 06:21.347
That looks right from here.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.199
There could be more people
inside the buildings.

06:24.399 --> 06:26.626
Jack, I think we should
bring Green into this.

06:26.826 --> 06:29.054
Come clean with her so
she can authorize backup.

06:29.254 --> 06:30.806
I don't want backup!

06:31.006 --> 06:32.858
Not until I know my family is safe.

06:33.058 --> 06:35.060
You cannot go into an
armed camp by yourself.

06:35.260 --> 06:36.562
If something happened to you...

06:36.762 --> 06:37.363
Nina!

06:37.563 --> 06:39.865
My family is being held
hostage because of me.

06:40.065 --> 06:43.435
If you bring CTU into this, they could
screw up and make this another Waco.

06:43.635 --> 06:45.571
Send me the photo now!

06:47.072 --> 06:48.207
I'm sending.

06:48.407 --> 06:51.577
Thank you. I'll get back to you.

07:10.095 --> 07:12.398
Get out of the car.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.600
What are you doing, Jack?

07:15.968 --> 07:19.104
Damn it, Jack, will you
get a hold of yourself?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.407
We had an agreement.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.410
I bring you here, you let me go.

07:24.610 --> 07:29.114
The agreement was as soon as my family
is safe, I would let you go.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.733
Jack, don't be stupid.

07:31.116 --> 07:33.619
Even if you get in there, you're
never gonna find them without me.

07:33.819 --> 07:34.620
Come on.

07:38.824 --> 07:40.125
Jack, please.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.379
All right, all right.

07:48.884 --> 07:50.186
You drive.

07:50.386 --> 07:54.890
Jack, if Gaines thinks for a moment
that I brought you here...

07:55.090 --> 07:57.643
...he'll have no problem killing us both.

07:57.843 --> 08:00.396
Then we should avoid Gaines.
Get in the car.

08:01.897 --> 08:02.898
Okay. Okay

08:04.400 --> 08:05.401
Just relax.

08:30.426 --> 08:35.431
Real or not, the threat on your life will
probably give you a bounce in the polls.

08:40.936 --> 08:42.938
What's wrong, David?

08:43.438 --> 08:46.742
- I'm tired.
- It's something else.

08:46.942 --> 08:49.945
You've been off your game
since you spoke to Carl.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.453
Carl's gonna stop the Kingsley
story from coming out...

08:57.953 --> 08:59.855
...by cutting off her source.

09:00.055 --> 09:01.957
- Keith's therapist?
- Yeah.

09:02.958 --> 09:05.527
Did Carl say how he
planned to do this?

09:05.727 --> 09:08.297
No. He just said I'd
better stay out of it.

09:08.497 --> 09:10.165
Maybe that's good advice.

09:12.968 --> 09:16.839
You don't seriously think Carl would
do something to hurt this guy?

09:17.039 --> 09:19.475
You know Carl better than I do.
You tell me.

09:22.478 --> 09:26.482
I think you're being paranoid,
but if you're really concerned...

09:26.682 --> 09:30.486
...I'll call this therapist,
tell him to be careful.

09:30.986 --> 09:33.489
I already tried. I got his
voice mail both times.

09:33.989 --> 09:35.791
You called him?

09:35.991 --> 09:37.860
Exposing yourself like that.

09:41.497 --> 09:45.367
For God's sake, David,
you're running for president.

09:45.567 --> 09:47.503
What were you thinking?

10:00.015 --> 10:04.520
If anything goes wrong, everyone
around the car dies, starting with you.

10:12.277 --> 10:14.029
Gaines has been waiting for you.

10:14.229 --> 10:15.030
I know.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.832
What happened to you?

10:17.032 --> 10:19.335
I had a fight with your wife.

10:19.535 --> 10:22.538
Are you gonna open up the gate
or do I have to do it myself?

10:29.545 --> 10:31.463
Roll up the window and go.

11:09.401 --> 11:10.402
Stop here.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.408
How may men on site?

11:17.909 --> 11:19.762
15, 20.

11:19.962 --> 11:21.413
Which is it, 15 or 20?

11:21.747 --> 11:23.415
I didn't do the hiring.

11:26.918 --> 11:29.755
My wife and daughter are in one
of these buildings. Which one?

11:30.422 --> 11:31.423
I don't know.

11:32.257 --> 11:33.425
Take a guess.

11:36.428 --> 11:38.430
This whole rescue act...

11:38.930 --> 11:42.484
...you really think it's gonna make up for
how you screwed up your marriage, Jack?

11:43.435 --> 11:46.321
Teri's told me everything.

11:46.938 --> 11:49.941
How you were never around,
the separation.

11:50.442 --> 11:52.444
- I mean...
- You're wasting your time.

11:53.945 --> 11:55.914
Teri's been very lonely.

12:00.952 --> 12:04.956
For the last time, which
building are they in?

12:08.960 --> 12:10.762
It's this one.

12:10.962 --> 12:13.965
It used to be used for cold storage.

12:17.469 --> 12:18.470
Ah!

12:25.477 --> 12:26.478
Damn it!

12:37.489 --> 12:39.791
- You understand my concern.
- Yeah.

12:39.991 --> 12:42.994
You do realize what's
at stake here, don't you?

12:43.194 --> 12:44.996
You know we're working
against the clock.

12:45.497 --> 12:46.632
Don't worry, Mr. Drazen.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.384
We'll be out of here within the hour.

12:49.584 --> 12:52.054
If there's a problem,
you'll be the first to know.

12:52.254 --> 12:54.506
- I want an update soon.
- Yeah.

12:55.507 --> 12:58.143
Hey Rick, where's Eli?

12:58.343 --> 13:00.779
I haven't seen him.

13:00.979 --> 13:04.516
I sent him to take care of the women a
half-hour ago. Find out what's taking so long.

13:04.716 --> 13:07.018
You want me to go load this up first?

13:07.218 --> 13:08.520
Yeah.

14:38.076 --> 14:39.110
Damn it!

15:06.888 --> 15:07.772
Hello?

15:07.972 --> 15:09.691
This is Dr. Ferragamo.

15:09.891 --> 15:11.626
Thank you for returning my call.

15:11.826 --> 15:13.361
Your message said it was urgent.

15:13.561 --> 15:16.698
Yes, I wanted to talk
to you about my son.

15:16.898 --> 15:19.650
You know I can't do that.
Doctor-patient privilege.

15:19.901 --> 15:22.053
That didn't stop you
from talking to the press.

15:22.253 --> 15:24.405
If you're calling to
threaten me, Senator...

15:24.906 --> 15:26.908
I'm not the one who's threatening you.

15:27.108 --> 15:28.910
Really?

15:29.410 --> 15:31.129
Whatever you leaked to Kingsley...

15:31.329 --> 15:34.382
...there are certain people who want
to stop you from confirming it.

15:34.916 --> 15:37.919
By certain people, I assume
you're referring to yourself.

15:38.119 --> 15:39.721
No. I'm trying to protect you.

15:39.921 --> 15:41.422
You've already covered up one murder...

15:41.923 --> 15:44.592
...and now you're threatening
me if I don't keep quiet.

15:44.792 --> 15:45.693
You're twisting my words.

15:45.893 --> 15:47.762
I think I'm hearing you clearly.

15:53.901 --> 15:56.070
You've reached the office
of Dr. Ferragamo.

15:56.270 --> 15:58.464
Leave your name at the sound of the tone.

15:58.664 --> 16:00.858
Dr. Ferragamo, pick up the phone, please.

16:01.058 --> 16:03.444
I need you to hear me out.

16:03.945 --> 16:04.946
Dr. Ferragamo.

16:09.951 --> 16:12.253
Doesn't sound like it went very well.

16:12.453 --> 16:15.456
I need to see him, Mike,
talk to him face to face.

16:15.656 --> 16:16.958
- Later.
- Now.

16:17.174 --> 16:20.044
David, You're supposed to be
delivering your policy statement...

16:20.244 --> 16:22.463
...on public health care in one hour.

16:22.964 --> 16:24.265
I'll be late.

16:24.465 --> 16:28.469
What are you going to do, pull up
to his office with your motorcade?

16:30.972 --> 16:32.974
I'll ride with the Secret Service.

16:35.977 --> 16:38.479
You're getting in way over your head.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.982
Pull over.

16:51.993 --> 16:53.995
They're gone. Let's go.

16:58.499 --> 17:00.001
Are you ready?

17:02.503 --> 17:03.437
Kimberly...

17:03.637 --> 17:05.506
Mom, don't say anything, I know.

17:08.509 --> 17:10.144
I love you, too.

17:36.037 --> 17:38.039
Teri, it's me. It's Jack.

17:41.542 --> 17:43.044
It's me, baby.

17:49.050 --> 17:52.053
- You okay? Where's Kim?
- She's here.

17:52.436 --> 17:54.522
Kim, sweetheart.

17:54.722 --> 17:56.057
Daddy!

17:57.558 --> 17:58.709
It's gonna be okay.

17:58.909 --> 18:00.061
I knew you'd come.

18:02.563 --> 18:06.067
It's all right, baby, it's all right.

18:09.070 --> 18:10.871
Can we leave now?

18:11.405 --> 18:14.575
Baby, we're gonna get out
of here soon. Just one minute.

18:42.436 --> 18:44.605
Making any progress?

18:46.107 --> 18:48.109
We're working on the projected
threat assessment.

18:48.609 --> 18:51.112
I think you both know where Jack is.

18:51.612 --> 18:55.616
If either of you are interfering with a
criminal investigation, harboring a fugitive...

18:55.816 --> 18:56.918
Jack is not a threat to Palmer.

18:57.118 --> 18:59.120
How do you know that, if you
haven't talked to him?

18:59.620 --> 19:00.704
And why is he still missing?

19:01.122 --> 19:02.623
Polygraph us if you think we're lying.

19:02.823 --> 19:04.625
So you can stall some more?

19:08.629 --> 19:12.633
Save us all a lot of time and trouble,
and just tell me where he is.

19:16.637 --> 19:19.640
Tony, go to Holding Room 2.
I'll be there in a few minutes.

19:19.857 --> 19:22.401
- Nina, go to 1.
- What are you doing?

19:22.601 --> 19:24.946
- I'm suspending you both.
- What?

19:25.146 --> 19:28.149
Until one of you tells me where to
find Jack, you're both suspended.

19:28.349 --> 19:29.450
You don't have the authority to do that.

19:29.650 --> 19:32.653
The first one who tells me will have
a career and a future here.

19:32.853 --> 19:36.157
The other one will be
prosecuted and discharged.

19:58.179 --> 20:01.182
Rick, I thought I told you
to go check on Eli.

20:02.183 --> 20:03.184
Yes, sir.

20:14.695 --> 20:16.497
Who is he?

20:16.697 --> 20:18.199
They sent him to kill us.

20:18.699 --> 20:22.503
- When?
- About a half hour ago.

20:22.703 --> 20:25.206
That means someone's gonna
come looking for him.

20:29.710 --> 20:31.712
Hey, sweetheart. Come here, come on.

20:31.912 --> 20:33.714
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

20:33.914 --> 20:35.516
Kim, it's me!

20:35.716 --> 20:37.635
Dad, it's okay.
He's the one who gave us the gun.

20:37.835 --> 20:39.136
- Get away from the door.
- Dad!

20:39.336 --> 20:40.721
Go back to your mother.

20:43.724 --> 20:46.227
Dad, stop it! No!

20:48.729 --> 20:50.197
Jack, you're killing him!

20:50.397 --> 20:53.234
He wants to get out
of here as much as we do.

20:53.434 --> 20:55.903
It's true. Jack, please!

20:59.740 --> 21:01.392
Why are you helping them?

21:01.592 --> 21:03.244
Because I got Kim into this.

21:03.744 --> 21:05.579
But I didn't know how
heavy it was gonna get.

21:05.779 --> 21:07.748
Get away from him.

21:07.948 --> 21:08.749
Get up.

21:14.255 --> 21:15.556
Is anyone else coming?

21:15.756 --> 21:17.758
- Not that I know of.
- Good.

21:18.259 --> 21:19.760
Go sit with your partner.

21:22.012 --> 21:23.764
I'm glad you're okay.

21:35.776 --> 21:38.279
We both know why Nina's covering for Jack.

21:38.779 --> 21:43.284
But I think the only reason you're
covering for him is to cover for Nina.

21:43.784 --> 21:47.288
From where I'm sitting, Tony,
it looks like she's using you.

21:47.488 --> 21:49.056
You don't know what you're talking about.

21:49.256 --> 21:52.093
I'm just trying to help you
see the situation clearly.

21:52.293 --> 21:56.797
Somehow, Jack Bauer is connected
to the threat against Palmer.

21:57.298 --> 22:01.135
By not telling me where he is, you're
endangering the life of a U.S. Senator...

22:01.335 --> 22:04.138
...who stands a damn good chance
of becoming the next President.

22:28.162 --> 22:29.964
What's Jack doing, Tony?

22:30.164 --> 22:35.169
Why did he show up at the Palmer breakfast
and grab the gun of a Secret Service Agent?

22:35.369 --> 22:37.421
He claims he was trying to
create a diversion.

22:37.621 --> 22:38.172
I know what Jack said.

22:38.672 --> 22:40.174
I want to know what you think.

22:41.675 --> 22:44.678
Look, if I knew where Jack was...

22:45.012 --> 22:46.513
- You do know.
- You're wrong.

22:46.713 --> 22:47.681
No, I'm not.

22:52.686 --> 22:56.690
Help me here, Tony, or getting fired
will be the least of your problems.

22:57.074 --> 23:00.694
I will make sure you're prosecuted.
You will go to prison.

23:04.198 --> 23:07.001
I'll give you 10 minutes.

23:07.201 --> 23:11.705
Take the time to decide if it's really
worth ruining your life over this.

23:29.222 --> 23:31.691
The car is parked at the
north end of the compound.

23:31.725 --> 23:35.729
I just need to go get it, and I'm gonna
pick you both up right there, okay?

23:35.929 --> 23:37.031
You're not leaving us.

23:37.231 --> 23:40.234
Sweetheart, I'm not leaving you.
I'm going to be right back.

23:40.734 --> 23:43.737
Bad things have only happened to
us because we weren't together.

23:43.937 --> 23:46.540
We're not separating again, Jack.

23:46.740 --> 23:49.743
Maybe you don't have to.
There's another way out.

23:49.943 --> 23:51.912
A better way, I think.

23:56.250 --> 23:57.051
How?

23:57.251 --> 23:58.552
Gaines still thinks I'm on his side...

23:58.752 --> 24:01.755
...so I can get one of the vans
without them noticing.

24:02.256 --> 24:04.758
Even if they stop me, your car
will still be there...

24:04.958 --> 24:06.760
...and you can all be together.

24:10.264 --> 24:11.982
He's right, Jack.

24:15.269 --> 24:16.270
You trust him?

24:17.271 --> 24:18.272
I do.

24:19.106 --> 24:21.275
Rick, it's Gaines.

24:22.776 --> 24:25.279
Rick, what's going on down there?

24:26.280 --> 24:27.681
Answer him.

24:27.881 --> 24:29.283
Mr. Gaines?

24:29.783 --> 24:32.586
- Where's Eli?
- He's outside.

24:32.786 --> 24:34.288
He's digging a hole
to bury the girls.

24:34.671 --> 24:37.791
Get him, damn it! I need
him back here right now.

24:39.293 --> 24:41.678
When Eli doesn't come back,
Gaines is coming down here.

24:42.296 --> 24:43.297
Let me get the van.

24:48.302 --> 24:50.804
You've got five minutes.

26:06.730 --> 26:08.698
Stack those on the side, you know.

26:11.218 --> 26:13.737
Should I bring these
down on the other side?

26:22.245 --> 26:24.247
We ain't got no time for lunch.

26:28.251 --> 26:30.053
I can handle it.

26:30.253 --> 26:31.555
There's been a change of plans.

26:31.755 --> 26:34.758
No, I need to know now,
not later. Now.

26:36.259 --> 26:38.762
What's so hard to understand about that?

26:41.264 --> 26:43.266
Come on guys, let's go.

26:45.735 --> 26:47.771
Will you guys hurry with
the truck down there.

26:57.581 --> 26:59.783
Hey Joe, where's Eli?

27:27.811 --> 27:28.962
What are you doing?

27:29.162 --> 27:30.113
Taking the van.

27:30.313 --> 27:32.757
I can see that, Rick.
Where are you taking the van?

27:32.957 --> 27:35.397
To help Eli get the bodies
from the guest house.

27:35.597 --> 27:37.838
You two can't move a
couple of women yourselves?

27:38.038 --> 27:40.824
I don't know. He told me to get
the van. So I'm getting the van.

27:41.024 --> 27:43.326
But if it's a problem,
I don't have to.

27:43.827 --> 27:44.828
Mr. Gaines?

27:46.830 --> 27:47.797
What?

27:47.881 --> 27:50.333
I was out patrol and I found Kevin.

27:50.834 --> 27:53.220
What? Is he alive?

27:53.420 --> 27:57.340
Yeah, but he's out cold. Someone
messed him up pretty good.

27:57.540 --> 27:58.141
Where are you?

27:58.341 --> 28:01.161
I'm in the North Grove,
near the generator.

28:01.361 --> 28:04.181
I'll be right there.
You're driving. Let's go.

28:09.352 --> 28:10.854
Open the damn door.

28:33.376 --> 28:36.880
At the very least, be careful
what you say to Ferragamo.

28:37.380 --> 28:38.899
I'll be careful.

28:39.099 --> 28:43.186
I mean, it's not like he's so
squeaky-clean in this thing.

28:43.386 --> 28:47.390
By talking about Keith to the press,
he violated every professional ethic.

28:47.590 --> 28:49.392
I know what he did, Mike.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.621
Pull over here.

29:04.123 --> 29:05.874
Here's the office.

29:11.630 --> 29:15.134
No. Let me find out what happened.

29:15.334 --> 29:17.002
I'll be right back.

29:28.147 --> 29:31.316
What happened? What caused this?

29:31.516 --> 29:33.652
A possible gas explosion.

29:34.153 --> 29:35.654
- Thanks.
- No problem.

29:47.666 --> 29:50.610
- It's Ferragamo, isn't it?
- There was a fire.

29:50.810 --> 29:53.755
They say it might have been
a broken gas line.

29:53.955 --> 29:55.174
He didn't get out in time.

29:55.507 --> 29:58.477
- Damn it!
- They torched his office.

29:58.677 --> 30:01.180
And you can bet his records were destroyed.

30:01.380 --> 30:03.349
We don't know anything yet.

30:03.549 --> 30:05.684
It could have been an accident, David.

30:05.884 --> 30:07.978
But it wasn't. It was murder.

30:08.178 --> 30:10.272
David, stop! Wait. Listen to me.

30:10.689 --> 30:12.191
Get out of my way.

30:13.609 --> 30:16.804
Hear me out. Just hear me out.

30:17.004 --> 30:19.999
Look, David, think this through.

30:20.199 --> 30:24.703
Even if you're right, this is
the absolute wrong way to play it.

30:35.714 --> 30:37.165
Damn it!

30:45.724 --> 30:46.725
Go.

31:01.740 --> 31:03.075
Time's up, Tony.

31:04.243 --> 31:06.745
Have you thought about what I said?

31:07.746 --> 31:08.697
I have.

31:09.748 --> 31:10.616
And?

31:19.258 --> 31:20.259
Excuse me. You have a call.

31:21.760 --> 31:22.761
I said no interruptions.

31:22.961 --> 31:24.263
It's Bauer.

31:29.268 --> 31:31.070
Where the hell are you, Jack?

31:31.270 --> 31:34.273
Alberta, you might have my office, but if
you want to do my job, then listen.

31:34.773 --> 31:36.075
I don't take orders from you.

31:36.275 --> 31:38.077
I located the people
behind the Palmer hit.

31:38.277 --> 31:41.080
You're one of them, unless you
can prove otherwise.

31:41.280 --> 31:44.433
They kidnapped my family, my wife and
daughter. But I'm with them now.

31:44.633 --> 31:47.786
That's why had to work underground
and why I couldn't contact CTU.

31:47.986 --> 31:49.788
You're telling me you haven't
spoken to anyone here?

31:50.289 --> 31:52.091
I couldn't risk it.
Believe me, I wish I could.

31:52.291 --> 31:55.544
It's not my job to believe you, Jack.
It's my job to find you.

31:55.744 --> 31:59.298
I'm at an orange grove, three miles
north of the split on the 5. Hold on.

32:00.799 --> 32:04.803
34 degrees, 17 minutes North,
118 degrees, 28 minutes West.

32:05.003 --> 32:06.555
- You got that?
- Yeah.

32:06.755 --> 32:08.107
I've identified 11 hostiles.

32:08.307 --> 32:12.311
They're traveling west on the compound
service road. Bring in air support.

32:12.511 --> 32:14.313
I'll get back in touch.

32:19.818 --> 32:21.620
Get me Central Dispatch.

32:21.820 --> 32:25.324
Find out where Jack's wife and daughter
have been for the last six hours.

32:26.325 --> 32:27.326
Damn it.

32:48.847 --> 32:51.350
- You ready to go home?
- Definitely.

32:55.854 --> 32:57.506
We'll finally finish our chess game.

32:57.706 --> 32:59.358
I'm two moves from checkmating you.

32:59.558 --> 33:00.859
Yeah, oh yeah, I know.

33:11.870 --> 33:15.374
We're gonna be all right, I promise.

33:19.878 --> 33:21.880
Let me know as soon as you see him.

33:22.381 --> 33:23.882
Yeah, okay.

33:30.889 --> 33:33.392
Teri, it's gonna be okay.

33:35.894 --> 33:37.896
Between us, you and me.

33:40.899 --> 33:43.402
I love you.

33:43.902 --> 33:46.905
And I promise you, everything is
gonna be different from now on.

34:08.994 --> 34:10.145
No, I want two choppers.

34:10.344 --> 34:12.848
If Villa has a problem with
that, he can call me.

34:16.568 --> 34:20.272
Jack called with his location. I sent
three field units to back him up.

34:20.856 --> 34:21.989
Is he all right?

34:22.858 --> 34:25.159
We'll find out soon enough.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.864
So, which one of us
are you gonna suspend?

34:29.063 --> 34:30.132
Neither of you.

34:30.331 --> 34:32.868
Only because I don't have
enough actionable evidence...

34:33.068 --> 34:34.870
...that you withheld information.

34:37.873 --> 34:39.875
But I plan to keep looking.

34:45.380 --> 34:48.382
I want to find out who's running
point on the field units...

34:48.583 --> 34:50.385
...so we can monitor what's happening.

34:56.891 --> 34:58.694
You okay?

34:58.894 --> 35:00.896
Alberta worked me pretty hard in there.

35:02.397 --> 35:03.899
Yeah, I know.

35:05.901 --> 35:09.905
I gotta tell you, if Jack
hadn't called when he did...

35:11.406 --> 35:13.708
You took a lot of chances for me.

35:14.242 --> 35:15.410
I won't forget it.

35:31.426 --> 35:33.929
Kevin... Kevin!

35:35.430 --> 35:37.432
Kevin, what the hell happened?

35:39.935 --> 35:41.236
Bauer.

35:41.436 --> 35:42.938
- He's here.
- What?

35:47.943 --> 35:51.947
I went to meet Cofell, but Bauer
had already gotten to him.

35:52.447 --> 35:53.748
How long have you been here?

35:54.282 --> 35:54.950
I don't know.

36:02.374 --> 36:03.875
Rick!

36:07.879 --> 36:11.383
Bauer's on site. Whoever's near the
guest house, we're going in strong.

36:11.583 --> 36:14.386
Seal the gate, make sure
no one gets out.

36:20.392 --> 36:21.893
Stay in the door.

36:47.419 --> 36:49.504
It's him. He brought
the van. Come on.

36:58.930 --> 37:01.766
Gaines is coming. He found the
guy you came in with.

37:01.966 --> 37:03.151
I'll drive.

38:16.925 --> 38:18.476
Hold on!

38:34.993 --> 38:36.528
Get down, get down.

38:41.866 --> 38:43.167
Hold on.

38:54.045 --> 38:55.630
Stay down!

39:01.553 --> 39:02.637
Get up to the van.

39:03.054 --> 39:04.472
Everybody out. Stay low.

39:08.643 --> 39:11.563
Get to the back of the van.
Use the wheels for cover.

39:17.569 --> 39:18.786
Take cover.

39:26.294 --> 39:29.080
- Cover me, I'm going across.
- Move, move!

39:31.082 --> 39:35.086
On the satellite photo you'll see an
old water tower down by the service road.

39:35.286 --> 39:38.089
Go straight through these woods, follow
the creek bed and run like hell.

39:38.289 --> 39:40.224
I'll make sure CTU finds you.

39:47.098 --> 39:50.268
- What about you, Jack?
- I'll be right behind you.

39:52.604 --> 39:55.006
There's too many of them.
Not if I help.

39:55.206 --> 39:57.609
- You know how to use that thing?
- Yeah

39:58.610 --> 39:59.744
Teri, stay there!

40:05.853 --> 40:07.385
I got a clear shot.

40:07.585 --> 40:09.087
I'm not leaving you, Jack.

40:09.454 --> 40:12.123
You won't be leaving, you'll be
taking care of our daughter.

40:12.323 --> 40:12.924
But Dad...

40:13.124 --> 40:15.843
Don't argue with me, sweetheart,
please. Both of you go, now.

40:18.796 --> 40:20.131
Go! Run!

40:35.647 --> 40:37.148
Keep covering me.

40:55.166 --> 40:56.668
Go to the tree line.

41:01.139 --> 41:02.173
Go.

41:24.195 --> 41:26.197
Come on, get up.

41:27.198 --> 41:28.700
Move!

41:35.707 --> 41:36.708
Let's go.

41:47.218 --> 41:48.720
Keep moving.

41:58.730 --> 42:01.733
I'll be able to stop the bleeding
when we get through the trees.

42:01.933 --> 42:03.735
Come on, I'm not leaving you behind.
