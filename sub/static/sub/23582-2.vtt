36:12.623 --> 36:15.791
<i>Ava Bloom, 117 61...</i>

36:15.826 --> 36:17.393
Molly?

36:18.963 --> 36:20.462
Hi, there.

36:20.498 --> 36:22.031
Hi.

36:22.066 --> 36:23.866
Sorry.

36:23.901 --> 36:25.201
Must have dozed off.

36:25.236 --> 36:27.469
Well, you found a good spot to do it.

36:27.505 --> 36:29.438
Yeah.

36:29.473 --> 36:30.673
Are you ready?

36:32.176 --> 36:33.209
For what?

36:33.244 --> 36:35.544
For your first one-on-one.

36:35.580 --> 36:39.114
I'm Gail, your advisor.

36:39.150 --> 36:41.383
How about we get you some coffee?

36:41.419 --> 36:42.918
I can use some myself.

36:44.388 --> 36:46.155
<i>I'd like to start with the basics.</i>

36:46.190 --> 36:50.626
So if you have any questions,
of course, that's great too.

36:50.661 --> 36:51.427
Sounds good.

36:54.732 --> 36:56.632
You're tugging at your clothes.

36:56.667 --> 36:59.068
Is this uncomfortable for you?

36:59.103 --> 37:02.805
No, it's very comfortable.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.840
Good.

37:04.875 --> 37:07.509
Tell me,
were you in therapy in Indianapolis?

37:07.545 --> 37:08.711
Indianapolis?

37:08.746 --> 37:10.379
Did I get that wrong?

37:10.414 --> 37:12.915
Oh, no, you got it right, actually.

37:12.950 --> 37:16.218
I've been just moving so much recently,

37:16.254 --> 37:20.055
that I put down Indianapolis
as my last permanent address.

37:20.091 --> 37:23.726
But you got it.

37:23.761 --> 37:26.061
I understand you came here in a rush.

37:26.097 --> 37:28.664
It sounded quite intense.

37:28.699 --> 37:29.665
It was.

37:29.700 --> 37:32.968
I was in a...

37:33.004 --> 37:34.670
dangerous relationship.

37:34.705 --> 37:36.538
Very unhealthy for me.

37:36.574 --> 37:38.474
But I got out of it.

37:38.509 --> 37:41.043
And it's okay, you know?

37:41.078 --> 37:43.445
I'm okay.

37:43.481 --> 37:44.613
Molly.

37:44.649 --> 37:46.582
Mm-hmm?

37:46.617 --> 37:50.386
This is a place where you
don't have to be okay.

37:54.058 --> 37:55.311
Thank you.

37:56.152 --> 37:59.061
Ending a relationship,
no matter how unhealthy,

37:59.096 --> 38:02.064
is an upheaval.

38:02.099 --> 38:06.001
So it's very important
that you understand why.

38:06.037 --> 38:08.537
Why... why I left?

38:08.572 --> 38:10.039
I think...

38:10.074 --> 38:11.940
Why you were there in the first place.

38:12.364 --> 38:14.643
That's easy.

38:14.679 --> 38:16.645
I think I was in love.

38:16.681 --> 38:18.380
And?

38:18.416 --> 38:22.418
And... isn't that enough?

38:23.653 --> 38:24.920
Apparently not.

38:24.955 --> 38:30.092
Well, then I guess I was in
love with the wrong person.

38:30.127 --> 38:31.760
Sure.

38:31.796 --> 38:32.795
But why?

38:34.932 --> 38:39.168
I would propose that when
you started the relationship,

38:39.203 --> 38:41.904
you were a little bit the
wrong person yourself.

38:44.809 --> 38:46.308
Not sure I'm following you.

38:46.344 --> 38:47.876
That's okay.

38:51.148 --> 38:53.315
Can you tell me why you're crying?

39:04.328 --> 39:05.961
I don't know.

39:05.996 --> 39:09.531
That's okay; you don't have to know.

39:09.567 --> 39:11.100
We'll get to the bottom of this.

39:11.135 --> 39:12.634
I promise you.

39:12.670 --> 39:15.504
Right down to the bottom.

39:15.539 --> 39:16.572
Good.

39:29.154 --> 39:31.688
Hey, Robbie, my man,
how's it hanging, bro?

39:31.723 --> 39:33.790
Low and to the left, amigo.

39:33.825 --> 39:35.058
No, not for me.

39:35.093 --> 39:36.660
I'm off the sauce for a minute.

39:36.695 --> 39:38.328
Got to get back in game shape.

39:38.363 --> 39:39.762
All right, no problem.

39:40.340 --> 39:42.966
That should cover my tab,

39:43.001 --> 39:45.068
with a little extra
for your hospitality.

39:45.103 --> 39:46.703
Aw, man.

39:46.738 --> 39:48.905
That's really nice of you, thanks.

39:48.941 --> 39:50.340
Whoa, whoa.

39:50.375 --> 39:52.175
Your tab's officially cleared, man.

39:52.210 --> 39:53.376
Good man.

Welcome to the Nighthawk.

39:59.117 --> 40:00.483

40:00.519 --> 40:02.085
We are want many drinks,

40:02.120 --> 40:04.821

40:04.856 --> 40:06.389

- Funs.

I am the most fun.

40:23.442 --> 40:25.675
Yeah.

40:25.711 --> 40:27.177
Let's go ahead and start a new tab.

40:27.212 --> 40:28.211
Let's go ahead and do that.

40:28.246 --> 40:30.046
Yeah, yeah.
