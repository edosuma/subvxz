[Emily] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.475 --> 00:09.677
So, what are you
doing after practice?

00:09.710 --> 00:11.612
Maybe you can call me later?

00:11.645 --> 00:14.014
For the record,
I've got dibs on Max, OK?

00:14.048 --> 00:17.418
If you wanna stay
on the national team,
we have certain conditions.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.221
Of course this means
no boyfriends,
no social activities...

00:20.254 --> 00:21.589
I wanna go to the Olympics.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.625
But what if I don't make it
and then I lose Damon?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.527
[Emily sobbing]
And I'm in love with him.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.162
You're in your eating disorder.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.631
[Kaylie] My situation's
just a little bit different
than everybody else.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.667
I don't belong here, either,
Kaylie. Neither of us do.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.070
Did your doctors clear you
to start training again?

00:36.104 --> 00:38.406
The only people I need
permission from are my parents.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.374
- Kaylie, you admitted
you have a problem.
- I lied.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.443
I don't have a problem!

00:42.476 --> 00:48.182
[melodic guitar song plays]

00:48.216 --> 00:52.753
* I thought a lot
about you today *

00:52.786 --> 00:57.391
* Why I did,
I can't exactly say *

00:57.425 --> 01:00.060
* But you kept creepin' in

01:00.094 --> 01:02.730
* Like a silent wind

01:02.763 --> 01:07.635
* Through the cracks
in the walls of my arms *

01:07.668 --> 01:13.441
* Now my heart did sing
and my eyes did shine *

01:13.474 --> 01:17.445
* Well, my mind
got tangled up... **

01:25.386 --> 01:27.188
Oh, my gosh.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.590
You didn't tell me Dallas
was coming to The Rock.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.692
You didn't tell me you
were working in a strip club.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.694
Well, I guess we're even then.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.697
Do you have any idea what
my NG-Ogre would think

01:36.730 --> 01:38.632
if he found out you were
working in a strip club?

01:38.666 --> 01:40.534
I'm not stripping,
I'm bartending.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.170
And Marcus is not an ogre,

01:42.203 --> 01:44.272
he's your lifeline to keeping
your position on the World Team.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.275
So, all you have to worry
about is following the rules

01:47.308 --> 01:50.144
- and kicking ass against
Dallas. Capisce?
- Whatever.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.515
[rock music playing]

01:56.517 --> 01:57.851
[shutter clicking]

02:03.857 --> 02:05.659
What are you shootin'?

02:05.693 --> 02:07.295
Darby asked me to
get some action shots

02:07.328 --> 02:09.630
to put in the program
for the Dallas meet.

02:09.663 --> 02:13.667
I hope you're saving some room
on your memory stick for me.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.403
Show me something
worth shooting.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.608
- I need the beam.
- That's too bad.
I'm working on it right now.

02:20.641 --> 02:21.875
It must suck to be you, huh?

02:21.909 --> 02:25.213
I mean, we can finally
see boys if we want to

02:25.246 --> 02:28.382
and your every move is
being tracked by the NGO.

02:28.416 --> 02:31.385
Thanks for your concern,
but I'm dealing with it.

02:31.419 --> 02:35.323
I'd go crazy if I had
a rock star boyfriend
who I could never be with.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.892
Well, I'm not you. Damon
and I have accepted the fact
that we can't be together.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.495
- At least until after Worlds.
- You're right, you're not me.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.632
I couldn't help but wonder
if he was hooking up with
someone else in the meantime.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.203
Did you come over here to work
your beam or work my nerves?

02:49.237 --> 02:52.706
I'm sorry, did I hit
a tender spot?

02:52.740 --> 02:54.508
Whatever, the beam's yours.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.277
[sighing]

03:03.417 --> 03:06.820
[strumming soft melody]

03:06.854 --> 03:10.658
* Just a face
on my computer screen *

03:10.691 --> 03:14.795
* My sad and lonely
beauty queen *

03:17.398 --> 03:19.700
* Is gone

03:28.409 --> 03:31.612
* Like a shooting star
across the sky *

03:31.645 --> 03:37.651
* She kissed the clouds and
softly sighed "good night" *

03:38.719 --> 03:41.689
* "Good night"

03:41.722 --> 03:45.726
* So I stare
into the galaxy *

03:45.759 --> 03:51.332
* And trace the path
that used to be your light *

03:52.366 --> 03:55.369
* Your light

03:55.403 --> 03:58.639
- That sucks.
- No, it doesn't.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.740
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.610
I didn't mean to ruin your...
flow or whatever.

04:02.643 --> 04:06.614
No... You OK?
You seem a little...

04:06.647 --> 04:08.749
Yeah, yeah, I'm just
processing some stuff.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.686
- So what's your song about?
- I don't know.

04:12.720 --> 04:16.424
Love, life, death? I don't like
to be too analytical.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.792
- Is it about Emily?
- Aren't they all?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.695
That's why I
came back to Boulder.

04:21.729 --> 04:24.698
All my best songs
are inspired by her.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.634
But since we can't
see each other,

04:26.667 --> 04:30.738
I've been, I don't know,
a little blocked.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.841
Well, what I just heard
was beautiful. It really hit me.

04:33.874 --> 04:37.678
That one... That one line
that's like, uh...

04:37.711 --> 04:41.615
* So I stare
into the galaxy *

04:41.649 --> 04:45.353
* And trace the path
that used to be *

04:45.386 --> 04:48.922
* That used to be
your light *

04:48.956 --> 04:50.758
- That's nice.
- Hmm.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.628
- That's not what I just sang.
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.431
I just totally murdered your
song. I'll leave you alone.

04:57.465 --> 04:59.767
- If you need anything,
I'll just be...
- No, no, wait, wait.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.537
That's not what I just sang.
It was... it was better.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.539
[chuckles] You're kidding.

05:05.573 --> 05:08.642
- No, you got some great pipes.
- Yeah, you sound like my mom.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.812
She's convinced
I am a singer like her

05:11.845 --> 05:13.046
but I don't really know
anything about music.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.649
Yeah, well,
you could've fooled me.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.585
Come on, let's sing it together,
before you forget.

05:17.618 --> 05:21.321
No. No, I can't.
I'd just feel really stupid.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.624
Oh, come on. Would you rather
keep "processing stuff",

05:23.657 --> 05:25.726
or set your mind free
for awhile?

05:25.759 --> 05:29.029
Ready? You start.
One, two, three...

05:29.062 --> 05:30.398
...four...

05:30.431 --> 05:31.932
[rock music playing]

05:39.940 --> 05:42.676
- Looking good.
- Not good enough
to beat Dallas.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.945
They're the best club in the
country. And let's face it,

05:44.978 --> 05:47.581
we've been slacking off
since Darby got here.

05:47.615 --> 05:48.682
If we don't pull it together,

05:48.716 --> 05:50.451
we're gonna look just
as foolish as she does.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.786
Hey, Darby.
We were just talking about

05:52.820 --> 05:54.955
how we're gonna
crush Dallas this weekend.

05:54.988 --> 05:58.659
Yeah, well, about that...

05:58.692 --> 06:00.794
Can I have all the elite girls
gather around, please?

06:05.433 --> 06:08.368
I have some bad news
and some good news.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.838
The bad news is:
Dallas cancelled.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.643
We need a competitive meet
before we go to Hungary
with the US Team.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.779
You didn't let me tell you
the good news.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.715
I pulled some strings
and found another club

06:21.749 --> 06:24.652
who's totally psyched to go up
against the amazing Rock Rebels.

06:24.685 --> 06:28.822
- Who?
- The Pinewood Gymnastics Club
from Davenport, Iowa.

06:28.856 --> 06:29.990
Pinewood?!

06:30.023 --> 06:33.694
They're one of the worst
ranked teams in the country.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.731
That's not the point, Lauren.
Payson's right.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.767
The Hungary Invitational
is in two weeks,

06:39.800 --> 06:43.003
and we need to see how
our routines hold up
in serious competition.

06:43.036 --> 06:45.473
Pinewood is hardly
serious competition.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.541
We may as well compete
against the Tumble Tots.

06:47.575 --> 06:51.111
This isn't just about you.
This is our first meet
with me as your coach.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.813
And we could all use a win

06:52.846 --> 06:55.516
going into a big
international meet.

06:55.549 --> 06:59.152
So let's get psyched!
Can I get a "Rock on!"

07:00.120 --> 07:01.755
[unenthusiastic] Rock on.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.622
What are you working on?

07:34.655 --> 07:36.790
Front handspring onto the
horse into a front tuck half.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.992
That's a really difficult
power vault. How's your back?

07:39.026 --> 07:41.461
Back's fine.
Surgery fixed it.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.163
- Well, if you're sure
- I am.hat.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.533
It's just a matter of
getting enough height
off the springboard,

07:45.566 --> 07:47.134
which is why I'm training
first with the tramp.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.037
- You want some help?
- No, thanks.

07:50.070 --> 07:54.041
Listen, Payson, we've sort of
gotten off to a rocky start.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.776
I know it's hard
when you lose your coach

07:55.809 --> 07:58.712
to have to start all over
again with someone new.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.048
But the truth is,
it isn't any easier

08:01.081 --> 08:02.683
being the new girl
at the gym.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.885
You're not the new girl,
you're the coach.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.486
But that's how I feel.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.456
I know you're not exactly
a member of my fan club.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.925
If I've seemed disrespectful,
I'm sorry.

08:11.959 --> 08:16.063
[chuckles] I don't need
an apology, I need a friend.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.166
Someone that will have my back
with the rest of the girls.

08:19.199 --> 08:24.171
Look, this whole gym
looks up to you, Payson,

08:24.204 --> 08:25.573
and it would mean
the world to me

08:25.606 --> 08:27.708
if I could count on you
to be that friend.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.745
I can understand that,
I guess.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.982
I mean, everybody
needs a friend, right?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.117
How 'bout we make
a little deal?

08:37.150 --> 08:40.921
If you could help rally
some enthusiasm
for this Pinewood meet,

08:40.954 --> 08:43.256
I'll help you turn that
handspring front tuck half

08:43.290 --> 08:45.693
into a handspring front full,

08:45.726 --> 08:47.194
which will increase
your skill value

08:47.227 --> 08:49.930
from a 4.8 to a 5.5.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.599
You think I can learn that
in time for the meet?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.834
This'll send your DOD
through the roof.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.569
And maybe having that
as our goal

08:55.603 --> 08:59.907
will help make the Pinewood meet
feel a little more competitive.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.780
I cannot believe Darby
agreed that The Rock

09:06.814 --> 09:10.784
would pay the entire tab
and put them up.over here

09:10.818 --> 09:13.587
- It's gonna cost us
a bloody fortune.
- Look, you were right.

09:13.621 --> 09:16.690
Darby is not old enough
to lead these girls.gh

09:16.724 --> 09:19.526
Hey, Summer. Can I go shopping
today after practice?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.995
They're having a major sale
at Forever Young.

09:22.029 --> 09:25.132
- Did you finish
your English essay?
- Well, no, but...

09:25.165 --> 09:27.134
No buts. And no shopping

09:27.167 --> 09:29.536
until you do your homework
and clean your room,

09:29.569 --> 09:31.939
which looked like a hurricane
blew through it this morning.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.241
OK. I'll see you
at home later.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.311
"See you at home later?"

09:38.345 --> 09:42.616
I'm staying with Lauren while
Steve's out of town on business.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.819
- Any plans to move in
- I don't know.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.922
Lauren needs a mother and
Steve needs help parenting her.

09:48.956 --> 09:53.193
- What about what you need?
- I like being needed.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.129
Well, if anyone needs you,
that would be Lauren.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.800
Yeah, well, it's called
"tough love" for a reason.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.171
[rock music playing]

10:10.644 --> 10:14.114
- That was an amazing dismount.
- It's just a "C" level skill.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.150
Well, I'm sure you have other
more impressive skills.

10:17.184 --> 10:20.788
- Like?
- Like... photography.

10:20.821 --> 10:23.256
And it just so happens that
Darby wants new head shots

10:23.290 --> 10:24.624
of all of us for the lobby

10:24.658 --> 10:26.694
and I was wondering
if you can take mine?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.361
Sure. We can do it
outside after practice.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.663
The light'll be perfect.

10:29.697 --> 10:32.900
And I'll be all
sweaty and gross.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.034
I have a better idea.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.003
How about you come over
to my house tonight?

10:36.036 --> 10:39.039
No one will be home,
so they won't be rushed.

10:39.072 --> 10:42.209
And we can just
take our time.

10:44.111 --> 10:48.181
* So I stare into the galaxy

10:48.215 --> 10:52.986
* Trace the path
that used to be *

10:55.188 --> 10:57.925
* Your light *

10:59.059 --> 11:00.794
I'm lovin' this song
right now.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.129
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.831
That's ridiculous.
I actually helped you?

11:03.864 --> 11:04.998
Yeah, totally.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.667
If I can just finish
the lyrics for the bridge,

11:07.701 --> 11:09.703
I'm gonna add it to my set
at the Shack tomorrow night.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.906
- Oh, you're performing?
- Yeah, it's not a big thing.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.374
I kinda get nervous
singing in front of people,

11:14.407 --> 11:17.077
so I need as much practice
as I can get.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.147
God, I always loved
performing for the crowd

11:20.180 --> 11:21.681
when I did gymnastics.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.884
Yeah, I could tell. You always
looked like you were having fun.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.219
- Yeah.
- [phone ringing]

11:26.253 --> 11:27.254
Excuse me.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.959
- Hello?
- [woman] Is this Kaylie Cruz?

11:31.992 --> 11:33.727
Yeah. Who's this?

11:33.761 --> 11:37.330
Kaylie, this is Musette Benson,
Maeve's mother.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.834
Oh, um... Hi.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.836
I just want to thank you.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.105
You really helped Maeve

11:45.138 --> 11:47.174
make the most of her rehab
this last time.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.910
Yeah. Yeah, she
helped me, too.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.245
The service is tomorrow
and I was hoping

11:52.279 --> 11:54.681
you might say
a few words.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.217
Me? What would I say?

11:57.250 --> 12:02.255
Just your impressions of Maeve,
how she was getting better.

12:02.289 --> 12:08.195
- It would mean a lot to us.
- Yes. Of course. I'll be there.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.767
You OK? Who was that?

12:13.801 --> 12:17.037
The mother of a friend. Uh...

12:17.070 --> 12:21.474
Not a friend really.
My roommate... from rehab.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.312
She passed away
a few days ago.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.413
Wow, I'm sorry.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.450
They want me to speak
at the funeral.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.953
I wasn't even sure I
was gonna go to the funeral.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.155
- Why not?
- I've never been to a funeral.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.926
- I wouldn't know what to do.
- You just pay your respects
by being there.

12:38.959 --> 12:42.129
But what am I supposed to say?
To a bunch of strangers?

12:42.162 --> 12:44.197
You say what you feel.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.233
Everybody wants me to say
what I feel, Damon.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.135
And I really don't know
what I feel.

12:51.038 --> 12:54.207
- I'm sorry.
- Hmm. No worries.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.144
I mean, I can relate.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.279
The only way I know what
I'm feeling half the time

12:59.312 --> 13:02.282
is when I read something
that I wrote in here.

13:02.315 --> 13:05.819
I'm like, "Oh, wow,
that's what I was feeling."

13:12.159 --> 13:13.994
Maybe you should
give it a try.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.782
- Payson.
- Is something wrong?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.551
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I'm deeply offended.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.220
Why? What did I do?

13:40.253 --> 13:41.488
Well, for one, you never
called me back

13:41.521 --> 13:43.223
after you told me
to call you.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.192
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry
about that, it's just...

13:45.225 --> 13:47.327
No, it's OK.
But what's not OK

13:47.360 --> 13:49.062
is that you need a new head shot
for The Rock lobby

13:49.096 --> 13:50.463
and you didn't ask me
to shoot it.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.900
Are you cheating on me
with another photographer?

13:52.933 --> 13:54.234
[chuckling]

13:54.267 --> 13:56.169
- [shutter clicking]
- OK, breezy and relaxed...

13:56.203 --> 13:58.138
[zoom whirring]

13:58.171 --> 14:00.240
[clicking]

14:00.273 --> 14:02.209
OK, the Mona Lisa looks
more relaxed than you.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.378
- Sorry. I'm just
not good at posing.
- It's OK.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.947
You should see
how beautiful you look

14:06.980 --> 14:08.381
when you don't know
I'm shooting you.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.217
Like, when exactly
are you shooting me?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.319
Not through my bedroom window
at night I hope?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.520
[chuckling] No.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.555
You're funny, you know?

14:15.588 --> 14:20.093
- Funny ha-ha, or funny, dorky?
- Both.

14:20.127 --> 14:23.363
And that's a compliment.
Let's try this again.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.870
You know what?
Your lips are a little dry.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.840
Just lick your lips for me.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.276
OK, they're still a little dry.
Lick them a little more.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.212
I mean, really lick them,
like this.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.917
- [clicking]
- [laughing]

14:43.951 --> 14:47.020
- OK, you're the dork.
- Beautiful.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.655
There you go.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.993
Hey, Max, you're welcome to stay
for dinner if you'd like.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.929
Mom. I'm sure he has
better things to do.

14:55.963 --> 14:59.099
Actually, I don't.
Although I do
have to be somewhere.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.867
I think we got
some good shots.

15:00.900 --> 15:05.205
Oh, OK.
So... so, we're done?

15:05.238 --> 15:07.474
Well, that's up to you.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.142
And if you decide
to return my call.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.147
- Thanks, Mrs. Keeler.
See you tomorrow.
- See ya.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.252
- So?
- So, what?

15:19.286 --> 15:21.554
I think that boy likes you.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.423
And I think you like him.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.093
Well, what if I call him
and he asks me out on a date?

15:26.126 --> 15:28.962
I don't even know
how I would feel about
having a boyfriend.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.263
I don't know
how I would feel

15:30.297 --> 15:32.199
about you having
a boyfriend, either.

15:32.232 --> 15:36.003
But I have no problem
with you making a new friend.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.270
Why don't you start there?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.711
[up-tempo guitar song plays]

15:53.153 --> 15:54.321
[beeping]

15:55.688 --> 16:01.328
* It gave our houses
scars in ways *

16:01.361 --> 16:06.099
* By drawing lines

16:08.235 --> 16:14.207
* At walls and borders
soldiers wave *

16:14.241 --> 16:18.345
* And work the lines again

16:18.378 --> 16:22.082
* To keep the others safe

16:27.320 --> 16:30.690
* With all the typical airs

16:30.723 --> 16:33.360
* On the battle lines
that have been drawn *

16:33.393 --> 16:35.262
* It's so typical
of us to... **

16:35.295 --> 16:39.999
Em! Have you seen my
little hoop earrings anywhere?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.672
All right, now honey,
you know you can't go to that.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.741
- Yes, Mom. I do.
- Honey, I know this is
hard for you.

16:48.775 --> 16:52.011
It's hard for me, too. We both
agreed to the no-boy rule

16:52.045 --> 16:53.380
when we signed that contract
with the NGO.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.383
Well, it's a good thing
they don't have a
"no stripper bar" rule.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.019
When you kick butt at Worlds

17:00.053 --> 17:01.388
and show them you can
follow the rules,

17:01.421 --> 17:02.989
we'll be off probation.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.558
And then you can
see Damon all you want.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.710
"But wishing on a fallen star

17:23.743 --> 17:27.514
won't change the truth
of where you are."

17:27.547 --> 17:30.617
Oh, hi. I thought you'd
gone for the night.

17:30.650 --> 17:34.387
Hey, sorry, I forgot my jacket.
So, how's it going?

17:34.421 --> 17:38.358
Well, I've been staring at this
notepad for almost an hour,

17:38.391 --> 17:41.328
- and I don't have anything.
- [chuckles]

17:41.361 --> 17:43.496
Have you talked to
anybody else about Maeve?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.598
- Like your parents?
- I can't tell them.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.401
If my parents found out that
my roommate from rehab died,

17:48.435 --> 17:50.237
they'd be even more
freaked out about me.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.738
Why? You're not her.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.641
Maybe I just won't go
to the funeral at all.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.076
- Just forget it.
- You need some back up?

17:57.110 --> 17:59.679
- What do you mean?
- I'll go to the funeral
with you.

17:59.712 --> 18:03.216
- Why would you do that?
- Because I know
from experience

18:03.250 --> 18:05.252
how important it is
to say goodbye.

18:06.653 --> 18:11.224
And you helped me with my song,
so I owe you one.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.129
Thanks. [clearing throat]
I'll think about it.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.298
And, yeah, thanks
for lending me this.

18:20.367 --> 18:23.336
- Good night.
- Good night.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.205
[giggling]

18:26.406 --> 18:27.507
[shutter clicking]

18:34.181 --> 18:36.115
Do you like what
I'm giving you?

18:36.149 --> 18:39.319
Uh, you're giving me a lot.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.821
I mean, this is a head shot.

18:41.854 --> 18:45.325
Maybe you need to be
a little less... expressive.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.828
Um... Well, maybe if
I change my outfit.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.831
- I'm not really
feeling this look.
- Go for it.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.367
I'll be right back.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.673
[phone ringing]

19:00.707 --> 19:03.410
- Hello?
- Oh, hey. It's Payson.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.645
- I didn't think you'd answer.
- Should I hang up?

19:05.678 --> 19:08.515
No, no. I just, thought you
had a prior commitment.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.350
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.653
No, no, no. You're not
interrupting anything...
important.

19:13.686 --> 19:18.591
Good. I just...
I'm returning your call.

19:18.625 --> 19:22.529
And I wanted to thank you
for taking my head shot.

19:22.562 --> 19:25.298
So, does this mean you'd like
to have that coffee sometime?

19:25.332 --> 19:27.600
You know, I'm not really
into coffee.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.502
Maybe we could go
running together?

19:29.536 --> 19:33.806
- Running? Sure.
- Great. It's a date.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.876
I mean, it's a plan.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.212
So I'll see you at
The Rock tomorrow

19:39.246 --> 19:41.681
so we can set up a time
for our plan.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.784
- How does that sound?
- Sounds good.
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.591
[Lauren] I'm back.

19:51.624 --> 19:55.562
* Freedom ain't free

19:55.595 --> 19:56.729
How do I look?

19:56.763 --> 20:00.767
Well, uh... great.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.936
But I don't think that look

20:03.970 --> 20:05.438
is gonna fly with the moms
at The Rock.

20:07.407 --> 20:10.743
[sighs] I thought as long as
you're here you might indulge me

20:10.777 --> 20:13.380
by taking some shots for
my personal portfolio.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.648
You know, more
fashion-type stuff.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.389
What do you say?
Do you want to indulge me?

20:24.457 --> 20:28.461
* Just let yourself breathe
Yeah *

20:28.495 --> 20:31.931
- [shutter clicking]
- [giggling]

20:31.964 --> 20:33.333
Shh!

20:33.366 --> 20:35.234
* Freedom, it ain't free

20:35.268 --> 20:37.470
- [gasping]
- What is going on here?!

20:42.309 --> 20:45.445
* Freedom, it ain't free *

20:51.651 --> 20:53.620
He was just taking pictures
of me, that's all.

20:53.653 --> 20:56.323
- You're practically naked!
- You wouldn't say that if
I was sitting by the pool.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.957
But you're not.
You're in your living room

20:57.990 --> 21:00.226
and you were trying
to seduce that boy!

21:00.259 --> 21:02.562
So what? Dating isn't
against the rules anymore.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.997
- Darby doesn't care what we do.
- Well, we do.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.867
And your father is gonna be
furious about this.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.437
- You don't have to tell him.
- Oh, of course I do.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.938
Please, Summer, can't you
just keep this between us?

21:11.971 --> 21:14.474
No, I'm not gonna keep secrets
from your father.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.976
But, I told him
I was going to change.

21:17.009 --> 21:21.948
- Then why haven't you?
- I'm trying. I really am.

21:21.981 --> 21:25.418
But I just feel like...
[crying]

21:25.452 --> 21:27.854
- ...nobody loves me.
- Your father loves you.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.722
No, he doesn't.
If he loved me

21:29.756 --> 21:31.824
he would have never kept
my mother from me. Ever.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.860
That was wrong,

21:33.893 --> 21:36.829
but he thought he was
protecting you.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.898
He loves you and so do I.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.800
But you didn't tell me
about my mother, either.

21:40.833 --> 21:44.571
And you were gonna run off
with Sasha and leave me here,
all alone.

21:44.604 --> 21:48.641
- Why doesn't anyone want me?
- I want you, Lauren.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.578
I'm not ever gonna
leave you again. I promise.

21:51.611 --> 21:55.415
You promised before.
How can I trust you?

21:59.452 --> 22:03.890
OK, listen.
I won't tell your father.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.559
But you have to promise me

22:06.593 --> 22:09.462
this is the last time you will
do something like this.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.899
OK. I promise. No more
sneaking around with boys.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.801
No more boys at all.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.505
Just, don't go away again.

22:21.808 --> 22:23.410
[sniffling]

22:33.386 --> 22:37.657
- Should you be doing that?
- [sighs] I made some flyers.
Big deal.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.959
We have a meet tomorrow
and you're not sticking
any of your landings.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.594
Come on. Pinewood sucks.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.329
I don't need to be sticking
my landings to beat them.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.631
And how about in Hungary
in two weeks?

22:44.664 --> 22:46.533
Against the Russians
and the Romanians?

22:46.566 --> 22:50.036
You need to be focused
on your career, not Damon's.

22:54.641 --> 22:55.675
[sighs]

23:14.594 --> 23:17.564
Sorry about last night.
Summer's a bit of a prude.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.966
Listen, I'm new here.
I don't want any trouble.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.501
You're not in trouble.

23:21.534 --> 23:23.603
And I still want to see
the pics you took.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.138
I'll email them to you later,
but I'm not sure we got
an appropriate head shot.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.575
I'm not sure I care.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.511
Emily's boyfriend is singing
at the Pizza Shack tonight.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.580
Everybody's going.
You wanna come?

23:33.613 --> 23:34.681
Everybody including Payson?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.516
Why do you care
if Payson's going?

23:36.549 --> 23:38.050
I think she's a nice girl.
Don't you?

23:38.084 --> 23:39.886
Sure. I also think
she's a lesbian.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.621
So, you're wasting
your time shaking that tree.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.556
See you tonight.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.067
That's a 15.5
start value power vault

23:55.101 --> 23:57.504
your daughter just landed.
Impressive, huh?

23:57.537 --> 24:00.072
Payson doesn't know the limits
of what she can handle.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.842
That's where you're supposed
to come in, as her coach.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.744
It's my job to support them.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.846
It's your job to set
boundaries for them,

24:06.879 --> 24:08.515
whether they like you
for it or not.

24:08.548 --> 24:11.784
Either you tell her
she's not doing that vault,

24:11.818 --> 24:14.153
or I will.

24:16.589 --> 24:19.559
All right. I'll do it.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.598
Hey, did you see me land that?

24:25.632 --> 24:27.800
I think I'm ready to switch out
the tramp for the springboard.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.936
Look Payson,
I've changed my mind.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.739
I don't think you should do
the handspring front full
anymore.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.041
Why? I know I can have it
ready for the meet tomorrow.

24:35.074 --> 24:38.578
It's a serious power move
and with your back,
I can't let you risk it.

24:38.611 --> 24:42.649
- We had a deal.
- Look, I'm really,
really sorry.

24:42.682 --> 24:43.683
Please don't be mad at me.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.451
This vault was the only reason

24:45.484 --> 24:46.886
I was the least bit excited

24:46.919 --> 24:49.488
- for this stupid meet
with Pinewood.
- OK, it's not stupid.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.658
Yes, it is.
And everyone but you

24:51.691 --> 24:53.793
knows it's a colossal
waste of time!

25:05.204 --> 25:08.941
OK. Listen up, Team Rock.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.646
Regardless of what you
may think of Pinewood,

25:13.680 --> 25:18.651
we have a meet tomorrow and I'm
just not feeling the excitement.

25:18.685 --> 25:21.520
So, call your parents
and tell them to bring
your sleeping bags

25:21.554 --> 25:24.724
because we're all spending
the night at The Rock.

25:27.827 --> 25:30.496
- What did you say to her?
- Too much.

25:30.529 --> 25:34.533
Well, thanks a lot.
I had a date tonight.

25:34.567 --> 25:38.270
- With who?
- Duh. With Max.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.610
[melodic guitar song plays]

25:52.051 --> 25:57.056
* Is there something
that you're trying to say? *

25:57.089 --> 26:01.027
* Is there a game
we forgot to play? *

26:01.928 --> 26:04.296
She was so beautiful.

26:06.032 --> 26:08.034
And so young.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.050
Kaylie, I'm so glad you came.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.052
I'm Musette, Maeve's mother.

26:26.085 --> 26:32.024
Yes, of course. I remember you
from Family Day at the center.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.560
This is Damon,
he's a friend of mine.

26:34.593 --> 26:40.099
- I'm very sorry for your loss.
- To say that we were shocked
is an understatement.

26:40.132 --> 26:44.637
Maeve was doing so well. She was
really on the road to recovery.

26:45.905 --> 26:49.075
I refuse to believe the anorexia
was what killed her.

26:49.108 --> 26:54.013
The doctors said she may have
had a heart defect at birth
or something.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.347
She was better.

26:55.381 --> 26:59.819
She was eating,
she was off the diet pills.

26:59.852 --> 27:04.123
She said you were really
supportive of her in admitting
she had a problem.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.195
If she is watching,

27:09.228 --> 27:12.064
I know she really wants you
to tell everyone

27:12.098 --> 27:15.334
how happy and healthy
she was in the end.

27:24.176 --> 27:26.112
I can't do this.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.624
- [sobbing]
- Hey, hey, you OK?

27:38.657 --> 27:41.027
I can't do it.
I can't go in there

27:41.060 --> 27:43.162
and tell them what
they want to hear.

27:43.195 --> 27:46.365
That she was getting better,
because she wasn't.

27:46.398 --> 27:51.203
She was lying to everyone.
Even to herself.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.339
And so am I.

27:53.372 --> 27:57.309
I don't want everyone
at my funeral to believe
all the lies I've told them.

27:57.343 --> 28:02.281
Because the truth is...
I am Maeve!

28:02.314 --> 28:04.851
And I don't want to die!

28:04.884 --> 28:09.121
- [sobbing] I don't want to die!
- It's OK. It's OK.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.905
Are you sure you want to stay?
You've been through a lot today.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.941
I'd rather be here than
at home feeling horrible

28:28.975 --> 28:30.442
for running out
on Maeve's funeral

28:30.476 --> 28:33.179
and not even saying
anything for her.

28:33.212 --> 28:37.716
Funerals are for the living
to grieve and say goodbye.

28:37.750 --> 28:40.219
There's all sorts of ways
you can do that.

28:40.252 --> 28:42.321
- Like?
- Well...

28:43.756 --> 28:46.759
...writing poetry like this.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.460
"But wishing on a fallen star

28:48.494 --> 28:52.698
won't change the truth
of where you are"

28:52.731 --> 28:54.834
I'm pretty sure
you were thinking of Maeve
when you wrote that.

28:54.867 --> 28:57.403
I'm sorry, Damon, I didn't
mean to mess with your lyrics.

28:57.436 --> 29:01.908
Are you kidding? Your lyrics
helped me finish the song.

29:01.941 --> 29:05.211
And if it's OK if I use them,
I'd like to sing it tonight.

29:05.244 --> 29:09.015
- Of course, yeah.
- With you.

29:09.048 --> 29:12.151
[stammers] Are you kidding?
I can't do that.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.286
Don't do it for me.
Do it for Maeve.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.790
To say that goodbye
that you couldn't today.

29:28.167 --> 29:31.270
Tomorrow, Pinewood
is coming here to The Rock

29:31.303 --> 29:33.439
and you better believe they're
pumped up and ready to rumble.

29:33.472 --> 29:36.809
And even if we are clearly
the better team,

29:36.843 --> 29:39.812
what glory is there in winning
if we're not having any fun?

29:39.846 --> 29:42.114
So, tonight we're gonna
get psyched up!

29:42.148 --> 29:47.286
But first, we're going to
release our gripes and
grievances to the universe

29:47.319 --> 29:51.023
with this bowl of
truth corn. That's right.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.459
This corn has magical
truth-telling powers.

29:53.492 --> 29:56.929
And as we pass it around,
I want you all to eat some

29:56.963 --> 30:00.466
and release whatever
it is that's on your mind.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.902
Payson? You first?

30:08.207 --> 30:10.176
- You want the truth?
- Absolutely.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.911
I'd rather be at home
right now.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.312
[munching]

30:15.347 --> 30:16.782
And I'd rather be
at the Pizza Shack.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.284
What's going on
at the Pizza Shack?

30:18.317 --> 30:20.419
Emily's boyfriend, Damon,
is trying out some new music

30:20.452 --> 30:23.155
and I know she'd
rather be there, too.

30:23.189 --> 30:26.058
And if you want us
to have fun tomorrow,

30:26.092 --> 30:30.262
maybe it would help if we all
had fun tonight? As a team?

30:30.296 --> 30:32.298
Damon's been to every one
of my major meets,

30:32.331 --> 30:34.266
and I've never
seen him sing live.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.802
What about the NGO? Emily's
not allowed to go anywhere...

30:36.835 --> 30:38.938
[Lauren] Without the team.
But if we all go,

30:38.971 --> 30:41.307
as a team field trip, she won't
be breaking any of the rules.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.109
Who wants to go
to the Pizza Shack?

30:51.283 --> 30:55.054
- Oh, what the heck,
let's do it!
- [cheering]

31:04.931 --> 31:07.366
* We'll make a place

31:07.399 --> 31:11.203
* Where we can lie together

31:11.237 --> 31:14.206
* Where the miles between us

31:14.240 --> 31:17.409
* They fall apart

31:17.443 --> 31:20.312
* I know you're out there
somewhere... *

31:20.346 --> 31:22.514
I really hope you don't
get caught doing this.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.551
Who's gonna catch us?
They think we're spending
the night at The Rock.

31:31.924 --> 31:34.860
Wanna see the pictures Max took
of me on our date last night?

31:34.893 --> 31:37.964
- He took pictures of you?
- Well, they were supposed to be
head shots for The Rock,

31:37.997 --> 31:41.267
but things got
a little steamy.

31:47.673 --> 31:51.210
[cheers and applause]

31:53.645 --> 31:56.415
Thank you. This next song,
Finally Free,

31:56.448 --> 31:58.985
was written
with a friend of mine.

31:59.018 --> 32:02.321
And I'm hoping she's
gonna sing it with me.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.222
C'mon. You can do it.

32:11.563 --> 32:14.633
[light applause]

32:14.666 --> 32:17.336
If you get scared,
just look at me. OK?

32:19.938 --> 32:22.608
- What's Kaylie doing here?
- Singing, obviously.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.576
- Kaylie can't sing.
- Shh.

32:24.610 --> 32:28.314
* Like a shooting star
across the sky *

32:28.347 --> 32:34.320
* You kissed the clouds
and softly sighed *

32:34.353 --> 32:37.990
* "Good night"

32:38.024 --> 32:42.061
* So I stare into the galaxy

32:42.094 --> 32:46.565
* And trace the path
that used to be *

32:46.598 --> 32:51.303
* That used to be your light

32:51.337 --> 32:55.041
* I try to make
the seconds last *

32:55.074 --> 32:58.277
* Pretend the moment
hasn't passed *

32:58.310 --> 33:01.647
* But wishing
on a fallen star *

33:01.680 --> 33:07.553
* Won't change the truth
of where you are *

33:07.586 --> 33:13.292
* Still I miss you
and I wish you *

33:13.325 --> 33:16.328
* Everything the heavens hold

33:16.362 --> 33:20.999
* And when you go
to sleep tonight *

33:21.033 --> 33:24.670
* Your soul is

33:24.703 --> 33:30.676
* Is finally free

33:32.044 --> 33:37.149
* Finally free

33:38.317 --> 33:40.686
* Finally free

33:40.719 --> 33:44.290
* Still gonna miss you

33:44.323 --> 33:46.558
- * And I wish you
- * Finally free

33:46.592 --> 33:50.129
* Everything the heavens hold

33:50.162 --> 33:54.533
* And when you go
to sleep tonight *

33:54.566 --> 33:58.204
* Your soul

33:58.237 --> 34:04.276
* Is finally free *

34:04.310 --> 34:07.346
[cheers and applause]

34:15.554 --> 34:18.257
[phone ringing]

34:18.290 --> 34:20.392
Steve, hi. Actually,
I'm at The Rock

34:20.426 --> 34:22.261
checking in on Darby
and the girls.

34:22.294 --> 34:24.796
Not that I don't trust her
to chaperone.

34:24.830 --> 34:28.134
Uh, let me call you back.

34:30.369 --> 34:33.639
Hello? Anyone here?

34:33.672 --> 34:36.142
[man] Hello?

34:37.409 --> 34:38.577
[man] Hello?

34:40.779 --> 34:45.050
Marcus, hi.
What are you doing here?

34:45.083 --> 34:48.254
I stopped by the Kmetko's
to check up on Emily
and Chloe told me

34:48.287 --> 34:50.556
- that she was spending
the night here.
- That's right.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.425
- She is supposed to be here.
- Supposed to be?

34:53.459 --> 34:56.162
Their sleeping bags are here
but they're not.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.464
- Where'd they go?
- I have no idea.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.434
I think I have one.

35:12.478 --> 35:15.714
[guitar strumming softly]

35:15.747 --> 35:19.885
[cheers and applause]

35:21.887 --> 35:24.556
Thank you. I'm going to
take a little break.
I'll be right back.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.095
You came.
What are you doing here?

35:30.128 --> 35:32.764
- The whole team is here.
- Are you gonna get in trouble?

35:32.798 --> 35:36.368
I don't care. It was worth it
to finally see you sing.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.670
And with Kaylie.
That was a big surprise.

35:38.704 --> 35:42.474
- Wasn't she awesome?
- Yeah, it was pretty intense.

35:42.508 --> 35:45.844
- She helped me write that song.
- Finally Free?

35:45.877 --> 35:48.847
- I thought that was about me.
- Em!

35:48.880 --> 35:50.649
Hey.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.684
I thought you couldn't come.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.187
You sounded great. I had
no idea that you could sing.

35:55.221 --> 35:58.490
- Neither did I.
- Listen, I better
get back up there

35:58.524 --> 36:00.826
before everybody
gets bored and leaves.

36:00.859 --> 36:03.195
- Will you stay?
- I'll try.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.334
I can see why you're
in love with him.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.436
He's a really
great guy, Emily.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.272
Yeah, he is.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.708
Hey, you were right, Lo,
Damon's awesome.

36:16.742 --> 36:19.345
Hopefully you'll realize
I'm right about everything.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.713
Well, look who's here.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.415
[together] Hi.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.551
I hate that we have to keep
meeting like this, Max,

36:25.584 --> 36:28.454
but, again, it's time
for Lauren to say good night.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.556
Excuse me.

36:32.658 --> 36:35.727
- So, when are we going running?
- We're not.

36:35.761 --> 36:39.431
Honestly I don't have time
for any new friends. Sorry.

36:39.465 --> 36:42.668
I don't understand why you're
so upset, we were just talking.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.870
You said no more secret
meetings with boys!

36:44.903 --> 36:48.173
- It wasn't a secret meeting,
it was a group thing.
- Lauren, zip it.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.843
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice, I'm an idiot

36:51.877 --> 36:53.779
and you're in big trouble
with your father.

36:53.812 --> 36:57.683
Emily, I ran into Marcus
from the NGO at the gym.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.718
- He's on his way.
- Marcus is coming here?

36:59.751 --> 37:03.188
- I knew this was a mistake.
- I gave him directions
for the long way,

37:03.221 --> 37:05.457
but we should get you
out of here.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.263
Uh, we can go out the back.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.764
I'll cover for you.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.935
- Hey, you're that
NGO guy, right?
- Yes.

37:16.968 --> 37:21.607
- Emily Kmetko here with you?
- Uh, no. When the team decided
to go out for pizza,

37:21.640 --> 37:23.809
Emily said she wasn't allowed
to go anywhere but The Rock.

37:23.842 --> 37:27.413
- So, she just went home.
- Hey, Pay Pay.
This was a great idea.

37:27.446 --> 37:30.382
Damon Young is awesome!

37:31.383 --> 37:34.353
- Hello, Darby.
- Marcus.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.757
What up?

37:38.790 --> 37:40.992
[* Superchick: Still Here]

37:42.794 --> 37:44.796
[cheers and applause]

37:52.871 --> 37:55.507
Well, they're definitely
a little tougher than
I remember.

37:55.541 --> 37:58.677
- Kinda like us when we
competed against China.
- But they're not us.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.980
And we're gonna prove that to
them by sending those scrappy
underdogs back to Iowa

38:02.013 --> 38:05.283
with their tails between
their legs. You guys ready?

38:05.317 --> 38:07.853
- One, two, three...
- [together] Rock on!

39:10.449 --> 39:12.984
* Still here

39:13.018 --> 39:15.654
* Still fighting on

39:15.687 --> 39:18.624
* All we have is today

39:18.657 --> 39:23.729
* Find my way to the beauty
of one more day *

39:23.762 --> 39:26.898
* Still here *

39:38.610 --> 39:39.911
[squealing]

39:45.083 --> 39:47.586
Payson, we can't lose.

39:47.619 --> 39:50.422
Not to Pinewood.
We need a Hail-Mary pass.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.824
Your vault is our last chance.

39:52.858 --> 39:54.926
We can still win
if you can land

39:54.960 --> 39:57.395
the handspring front full
we worked on.

39:57.429 --> 40:00.131
I haven't done it without
the practice tramp.

40:00.165 --> 40:04.903
- But I can try.
- Go for it.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.575
- What was that about?
- I'm the coach.

40:09.608 --> 40:10.976
And I do not need gym moms

40:11.009 --> 40:12.911
asking me questions
during a meet.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.646
You better not have told her
to do that vault.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.482
I told her to do
what was necessary

40:16.515 --> 40:18.517
for The Rock
to win this meet.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.951
I tried to defend you,

40:19.985 --> 40:23.922
but you put my daughter at risk,
I'll be your worst enemy.

40:37.503 --> 40:38.637
[grunting]

40:38.670 --> 40:40.472
[all gasping]

40:49.681 --> 40:52.651
[all giggling, chattering]

41:03.495 --> 41:05.597
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

41:05.631 --> 41:09.034
- Well, that sucked.
- Big time.

41:15.006 --> 41:17.075
You know, there is something
to be learned from this.

41:17.108 --> 41:20.145
Yeah, we learned that we need
a coach. A real coach.

41:20.178 --> 41:23.615
Not a buddy. Not a teammate.
A real coach.

41:23.649 --> 41:27.853
OK, calm down, Payson.
What exactly do you mean
by "real" coach?

41:27.886 --> 41:32.624
A real coach isn't afraid to
be the bad guy if she has to be.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.926
A real coach would've told me
not to go for a vault

41:34.960 --> 41:36.862
that I have never done
without a practice tramp.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.497
A real coach
would know better

41:39.531 --> 41:41.833
than to let me make a fool
of myself and my team.

41:41.867 --> 41:44.670
And a real coach doesn't
take her team out to party

41:44.703 --> 41:45.904
the night before a meet

41:45.937 --> 41:48.774
just because she wants
the whole team to like her.

42:03.889 --> 42:07.926
And a real coach would never
walk away from a diss like that.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.527
You think she'll
ever come back?

42:09.561 --> 42:12.130
We're better off without her.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.532
[all sighing]

42:14.566 --> 42:17.302
[melodic guitar song plays]

42:22.941 --> 42:27.278
* I talked a lot
about you today *

42:27.312 --> 42:31.516
* I told a friend
how we used to play *

42:31.549 --> 42:34.252
* How you came sweeping in

42:34.285 --> 42:36.655
* Like a mighty wind

42:36.688 --> 42:41.793
* Through the cracks
in the walls of my arms *

42:41.827 --> 42:46.798
* And how my heart did sing
and my eyes did shine *

42:46.832 --> 42:50.769
* Well, my mind
got tangled up *

42:54.039 --> 42:57.776
* Tangled up

42:59.144 --> 43:01.980
* Tangled up

43:04.215 --> 43:06.685
* Tangled up

43:09.287 --> 43:12.123
* Tangled up

43:14.359 --> 43:16.995
* Tangled up *
