01:10.500 --> 01:11.899
What's going on?

01:12.019 --> 01:14.425
Yeah, these have never gone off before.

01:14.926 --> 01:16.545
Allura, what is it?

01:16.665 --> 01:19.180
Looks like you guys just saw a ghost.

01:19.260 --> 01:22.640
That's just the thing. It's
an old Altean distress code.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.520
One used by King Alfor's ships.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.823
Could it be?

01:25.943 --> 01:27.662
Are we not the last Alteans alive?

01:27.782 --> 01:29.353
Wait. What if someone's cloning

01:29.473 --> 01:30.980
the signal to try and lure us in?

01:31.070 --> 01:32.857
The signal is from an Altean ship,

01:32.977 --> 01:34.820
and we're going to find it.

01:45.157 --> 01:46.682
That looks like a

01:46.802 --> 01:48.550
Tel-Galax exploration shuttle.

01:48.670 --> 01:50.500
One of my father's deep space vessels.

01:50.580 --> 01:53.090
According to the ship's
identification code,

01:53.170 --> 01:55.340
it's Commodore Trayling's ship.

01:55.420 --> 01:56.998
But I don't see any records of

01:57.118 --> 01:58.640
its destination or mission.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.510
- What happened to it?
- Is it stuck in a wormhole?

02:01.600 --> 02:03.890
That's unlike any
wormhole I've ever seen.

02:03.970 --> 02:06.480
There's a massive amount
of energy emanating from it,

02:06.560 --> 02:08.600
centered right where the ship is stuck.

02:08.690 --> 02:10.715
We have to see if anyone is aboard.

02:10.835 --> 02:13.820
- They may need our help.
- We could send a probe over to it,

02:13.940 --> 02:16.530
see if we can get some kind
of idea what this thing is?

02:16.610 --> 02:17.840
Do it.

02:22.870 --> 02:25.119
The energy shows no signs of radioactive

02:25.239 --> 02:27.040
decay and it's not thermal.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.679
It's not gravitational, our
probe is steady on course,

02:29.799 --> 02:31.428
and the light is radiating out,

02:31.467 --> 02:33.300
not in, like it would in a black hole.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.251
But out from where?

02:35.537 --> 02:37.787
That energy signature, I know it.

02:38.397 --> 02:40.180
It's radiating quintessence!

02:45.260 --> 02:47.100
Ooh! That's weird.

02:47.180 --> 02:50.480
Okay, well, let's not
go anywhere near there.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.650
We must.

02:51.730 --> 02:54.020
Hold on. Didn't you
just see what happened?

02:54.110 --> 02:55.570
Voltron's compositional strength

02:55.650 --> 02:58.030
far exceeds anything
else in this universe.

02:58.110 --> 03:00.280
We received an Altean distress call,

03:00.360 --> 03:02.910
which must mean that
someone is alive on the ship.

03:02.990 --> 03:06.290
As Paladins of Voltron,
it is our duty to help.

03:06.370 --> 03:08.388
Princess, I still think there's a

03:08.508 --> 03:10.623
chance that this whole thing is a trap.

03:10.743 --> 03:12.344
Even if it's not a trap, it's far

03:12.464 --> 03:14.010
too dangerous to go in there.

03:14.130 --> 03:16.170
I'll do it myself if I have to.

03:21.970 --> 03:24.390
All right, let's take it slow.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.349
Pidge, any chance you can explain

03:26.469 --> 03:28.150
what I'm seeing right now?

03:28.270 --> 03:30.133
The Euclidian space around the ship

03:30.253 --> 03:31.940
is obviously some kind of anomaly.

03:32.060 --> 03:34.900
But the energy source doesn't
originate from anything that registers

03:34.980 --> 03:37.400
with my understanding
of how reality works.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.240
I'll take that as a "no."

03:39.320 --> 03:41.200
I'll scan the ship for biorhythms.

03:44.070 --> 03:45.345
That's strange.

03:45.465 --> 03:47.537
I'm not showing any
signs of life on the ship.

03:47.657 --> 03:49.062
Maybe not on this half,

03:49.182 --> 03:51.525
but there is more to this
ship than we are seeing.

03:51.645 --> 03:53.670
We need to go through there.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.880
The glowy, explode-y area?

03:55.960 --> 03:58.880
Pidge, keep an eye on Voltron's vitals.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.050
Everyone, be prepared to
abort if things get hairy.

04:02.130 --> 04:04.590
Roger that. Ready to abort immediately.

04:06.550 --> 04:09.140
Guys, my sensors are going crazy.

04:09.220 --> 04:12.100
Technically, we should be torn
apart the same way the probe was.

04:12.180 --> 04:14.600
But somehow Voltron is
completely unaffected

04:14.690 --> 04:16.440
by the stress of the spatial distortion.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.546
Hello? What are you seeing?

04:18.666 --> 04:20.558
I'm losing visual. Hello?

04:27.620 --> 04:29.200
No!

04:35.740 --> 04:37.703
We must have crossed through because

04:37.823 --> 04:40.391
- that's the front of the ship.
- Wait.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.985
The back half of this ship, it's gone!

04:45.607 --> 04:47.823
Coran! Coran!

04:47.943 --> 04:49.893
We've lost sight of the Castle.

04:50.013 --> 04:52.270
- Coran, are you there?
- Where did he go?

04:52.850 --> 04:54.860
And where did that planet come from?

04:56.107 --> 04:58.561
According to my sensors, we're still in

04:58.681 --> 05:01.230
exactly the same place we were before.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.820
Guys, this is gonna sound strange,

05:03.900 --> 05:06.860
but now I'm detecting multiple
biorhythms aboard the ship.

05:07.780 --> 05:09.280
Alteans.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.790
It seems like we've only got one clue

05:11.870 --> 05:13.750
to help us figure out what's going on,

05:13.830 --> 05:15.870
and it's floating right over there.

05:28.590 --> 05:31.640
Hello? Is anyone here?

05:44.280 --> 05:46.742
Oh, man. This place is
totally freaking me out.

05:47.228 --> 05:50.069
Does it feel like a haunted
ghost ship to anybody else?

05:50.189 --> 05:51.270
Is it just me?

06:03.881 --> 06:05.067
So,

06:05.187 --> 06:07.340
did the crew abandon ship?

06:09.876 --> 06:11.982
I don't know, but they
couldn't have gotten

06:12.102 --> 06:14.260
far without their spacesu...

06:14.350 --> 06:15.810
Those aren't empty!

06:20.782 --> 06:22.788
We located the second comet based

06:22.908 --> 06:24.690
on King Alfor's information.

06:24.810 --> 06:26.743
We managed to get it
aboard, but it seems

06:26.863 --> 06:29.200
to be causing massive disturbances.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.860
We're heading back to Altea,

06:30.950 --> 06:33.642
but I don't know if we'll
be able to make it that far.

06:33.762 --> 06:35.802
At this rate...

06:37.756 --> 06:39.830
What happened here?

06:40.670 --> 06:42.330
Something deadly.

06:43.249 --> 06:45.021
This still doesn't explain the

06:45.141 --> 06:47.090
biorhythms I picked up in this area.

06:52.010 --> 06:53.220
Look out!

07:29.340 --> 07:32.510
No way! Shiro?

07:32.590 --> 07:33.640
How...?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.010
Stay back!

07:35.100 --> 07:37.510
If you've come for the
comet, you'll never get it.

07:37.600 --> 07:40.780
I'll die before I let it
fall into Altean hands.

07:41.770 --> 07:45.980
- Shiro, please.
- My name is not Shiro.

07:46.060 --> 07:48.980
What the heck is happening right now?

07:49.070 --> 07:51.650
Did everyone get amnesia and
then wake up with weird accents?

07:51.740 --> 07:53.780
- You know us?
- Of course, we do!

07:53.860 --> 07:56.490
You're Shiro, our leader.
Paladin of the Black Lion?

07:56.580 --> 07:59.370
And you're Slav. I rescued
you from a space prison.

07:59.450 --> 08:01.960
- You're also slightly crazy.
- I may be crazy,

08:02.040 --> 08:05.478
but you've never rescued
me from anything before.

08:05.598 --> 08:06.775
Unless...

08:06.895 --> 08:09.590
- you're from an alternate reality.
- This is an alternate reality.

08:09.670 --> 08:11.300
Uh, what's that now?

08:11.420 --> 08:12.970
I think, when we passed through

08:13.090 --> 08:14.680
that glowy, explode-y area,

08:14.760 --> 08:17.140
we entered an alternate reality.

08:17.220 --> 08:19.560
You mean, like, what Slav
was always talking about?

08:19.640 --> 08:22.060
Well, not you. Well, you,
yeah, but a different you.

08:22.140 --> 08:24.480
One that talks about
alternate realities a lot.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.400
Oh, that's him.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.730
Why did you attack the
captain and his crew?

08:28.820 --> 08:31.530
- Stay back, Altean.
- We found the ship this way.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.743
But I can't say I'm sorry they're gone.

08:33.749 --> 08:35.452
Oh, no!

08:35.572 --> 08:37.745
- More Alteans!
- Wait!

08:37.865 --> 08:39.289
More Alteans?

08:39.409 --> 08:41.580
Their scanners must have
picked up your arrival.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.340
Sven, let's go!

08:43.539 --> 08:45.248
If I were you, I'd run.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.670
What the heck just happened?

08:48.750 --> 08:50.920
Did he say we're being
boarded by Alteans?

09:13.610 --> 09:15.360
Put down your weapons!

09:16.740 --> 09:20.660
- Alteans!
- It can't be.

09:21.620 --> 09:22.950
Empress!

09:30.170 --> 09:33.210
Uh, I'm confused. What is going on?

09:35.682 --> 09:38.094
Are you Empress Allura?

09:38.646 --> 09:41.010
I am Princess Allura.

09:41.306 --> 09:43.850
Please, stand.

09:44.541 --> 09:47.061
I am Commander Hira, Empress.

09:47.181 --> 09:48.850
How can you be here?

09:48.970 --> 09:50.483
You put down the Galra Uprising

09:50.603 --> 09:52.320
and established the Altean Empire

09:52.400 --> 09:54.358
10,000 years ago.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.694
Where we're from, all the Alteans

09:56.814 --> 09:58.450
were wiped out by Zarkon

09:58.570 --> 10:00.160
when he destroyed your planet.

10:01.910 --> 10:03.950
Where did you come from?

10:06.612 --> 10:08.656
Amazing. Your theory about Voltron

10:08.776 --> 10:10.880
was finally proven correct.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.920
I was personally hoping to
see some more fireworks

10:13.000 --> 10:14.840
when it hit that energy swirl.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.920
I guess all of the previous
attempts to get it out

10:17.010 --> 10:18.680
were just more enjoyable to watch.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.640
For me, not for your pilots.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.672
Voltron made it through because

10:22.792 --> 10:24.600
he is made of the same material

10:24.720 --> 10:26.297
as that comet that King Alfor

10:26.417 --> 10:28.390
tried to hide from my father.

10:28.480 --> 10:30.458
Now, let's see if the new paladins

10:30.578 --> 10:32.021
bring it back out to us.

10:32.141 --> 10:33.893
But what if Voltron is unable

10:34.013 --> 10:36.230
to escape the other dimension?

10:36.320 --> 10:38.311
It's another reality, Ezor.

10:39.660 --> 10:43.080
What if they aren't able to
escape the other reality?

10:43.160 --> 10:45.950
If Voltron disappears
from our world, then we win.

10:46.040 --> 10:49.370
If they make it out with the
comet, we'll take it from them.

10:49.460 --> 10:51.960
It's a win either way.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.710
This is the comet Commodore Trayling

10:54.800 --> 10:56.763
must've been talking about
in his transmission.

10:56.883 --> 10:58.603
It seems to be caught between two

10:58.641 --> 11:00.599
realities, just like the ship.

11:00.719 --> 11:03.220
Could you obtain a sample
for us with your lion?

11:03.300 --> 11:04.482
I can try.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.650
Amazing.

11:12.622 --> 11:13.976
It's Voltron.

11:14.319 --> 11:15.860
What?

11:15.940 --> 11:18.570
I mean, it's not Voltron, obviously,

11:18.650 --> 11:20.240
but the readings from this comet

11:20.360 --> 11:22.303
are the same ones
Zarkon was searching for.

11:22.423 --> 11:24.990
The same ones that led
us to the Blue Lion.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.606
That's how you were able to

11:26.644 --> 11:28.500
pass through to this reality.

11:28.620 --> 11:32.210
Your vehicle was made from the
same trans-reality material.

11:32.290 --> 11:35.090
So, that's why Voltron's so powerful.

11:35.399 --> 11:37.081
With this material,

11:37.201 --> 11:41.090
Altea can create their own
trans-reality traveling ships.

11:41.170 --> 11:45.050
We can spread our peace
and stability to all realities.

11:46.093 --> 11:47.241
General Hira,

11:47.361 --> 11:49.720
I have just stumbled across
something in this ship's hold

11:49.810 --> 11:53.060
that will ensure Altea's
rule for millennia to come.

11:56.690 --> 12:00.490
So, the Alteans of this
reality defeated the Galra?

12:00.570 --> 12:02.700
Led by you, My Empress.

12:02.780 --> 12:05.910
Without your will to fight and
avenge the loss of your father,

12:05.990 --> 12:09.080
Altea would not have been able
to spread peace and stability

12:09.160 --> 12:10.910
throughout the universe.

12:22.196 --> 12:24.077
That's the last of them.

12:24.197 --> 12:26.180
Do you think this plan will work?

12:26.300 --> 12:27.495
Don't worry.

12:28.019 --> 12:30.254
I'm 60 percent sure this is one of the

12:30.374 --> 12:32.230
.15 percent of realities

12:32.350 --> 12:35.190
where this plan works
100 percent of the time.

12:35.270 --> 12:37.133
Do you think the people from the

12:37.253 --> 12:39.490
other reality will join the Alteans?

12:39.610 --> 12:42.110
If they're really my friends
from another reality,

12:42.190 --> 12:43.796
there's a 72 percent chance

12:43.916 --> 12:45.950
they'll figure out what's right.

12:46.550 --> 12:48.990
Defeating Zarkon was the first step,

12:49.110 --> 12:51.338
but we refuse to give
up until all worlds

12:51.458 --> 12:54.250
know the true peace Altea has achieved.

12:54.330 --> 12:56.960
That is so wonderful!

12:57.040 --> 12:59.460
No struggle, no wars.

12:59.540 --> 13:02.067
- That doesn't even sound possible.
- Is it not?

13:02.187 --> 13:03.850
Look at Moxilous.

13:03.970 --> 13:06.640
For generations, his people
have been in constant battle

13:06.720 --> 13:08.760
with the other planets in their system.

13:08.850 --> 13:11.456
It was a barbaric, futile existence.

13:11.885 --> 13:13.896
But look at him now.

13:14.992 --> 13:16.622
So, what changed?

13:16.993 --> 13:18.770
The hoktril.

13:19.817 --> 13:21.609
Our civilization's most advanced

13:21.647 --> 13:23.820
technological achievement.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.240
What does that do?

13:25.320 --> 13:28.110
It saps the fighting
force from our enemies.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.330
Their will, you might say.

13:32.030 --> 13:33.908
Advancements have been made.

13:34.028 --> 13:35.904
Citizens that might have been casualties

13:36.024 --> 13:37.670
of war in Empress Allura's day

13:37.750 --> 13:39.500
can now be rehabilitated.

13:39.973 --> 13:42.565
Entire races who warred for millennia

13:42.685 --> 13:44.300
can now know peace

13:44.420 --> 13:47.090
and help us to further our new world.

13:47.180 --> 13:50.350
So, they become a part of
the Altean peace movement?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.180
You mean, slave labor?

13:53.902 --> 13:55.555
Oh, no, no. They're not slaves

13:55.675 --> 13:58.060
because they don't have will.

13:58.180 --> 13:59.425
Slaves are

13:59.545 --> 14:02.070
always trying to escape or revolt.

14:02.150 --> 14:05.477
The non-cogs are content
doing what they're told.

14:06.249 --> 14:08.035
Preservation of life

14:08.155 --> 14:10.913
is the Altean Empire's highest priority.

14:11.740 --> 14:13.540
And with this material,

14:13.620 --> 14:17.210
we can do even more than
we thought possible.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.620
But you're taking away their free will.

14:20.290 --> 14:23.340
The same will that would end
your life with no remorse.

14:23.420 --> 14:26.340
Thanks to us, no innocent
will lose its life

14:26.420 --> 14:29.430
to the free will of an evil being.

14:29.510 --> 14:32.300
Empress Allura, let me
show you something.

14:36.390 --> 14:39.390
This is our Altea.

14:40.065 --> 14:42.099
Come with me. Allow me to show you

14:42.219 --> 14:44.860
the magnificence it has achieved.

14:45.511 --> 14:48.280
Is anyone else getting a
strange vibe from these guys?

14:48.400 --> 14:49.887
Yeah, there's definitely something

14:49.925 --> 14:51.298
off about these Alteans.

14:51.418 --> 14:53.099
I mean, is it me or did they pretty

14:53.219 --> 14:54.920
much scramble the big dude's brain?

14:56.160 --> 14:57.950
Yoo-hoo! Up here!

14:58.580 --> 15:00.370
Whoa! How'd you find us?

15:00.460 --> 15:02.500
I figured there was a
high probability that...

15:02.580 --> 15:04.290
Wait, stop. Nope. Never mind.

15:04.380 --> 15:06.000
We gotta get to Keith and Allura

15:06.090 --> 15:08.720
and figure out a way to stop the
Alteans from getting that comet.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.840
Already on it. We just need to do one
more thing and you guys can help.

15:14.686 --> 15:16.058
Perfect!

15:16.096 --> 15:19.390
I had a feeling the Guns of
Gamara were on this ship.

15:19.661 --> 15:21.853
But I didn't know Empress Allura's

15:21.891 --> 15:24.230
friends would be working with them.

15:26.020 --> 15:27.613
Returning to Altea...

15:27.733 --> 15:29.791
It seemed like such an impossible dream,

15:29.911 --> 15:32.775
- I could never allow the thought.
- Allura,

15:33.261 --> 15:36.034
this might not be the
Altea you remember.

15:36.530 --> 15:37.950
You're right.

15:38.040 --> 15:39.660
This Altea is home to a people

15:39.750 --> 15:41.562
who made sure that the Galra scourge was

15:41.682 --> 15:43.460
unable to spread across the universe,

15:43.580 --> 15:45.250
as it did in your reality.

15:45.370 --> 15:47.120
Empress, I assure you, we will do

15:47.240 --> 15:49.550
everything in our power to help.

15:49.670 --> 15:51.644
The comet in this ship's hold possesses

15:51.682 --> 15:54.890
the ability to travel between realities.

15:54.970 --> 15:57.694
If you will activate this
ancient ship's power,

15:57.814 --> 16:01.520
we can fly forward and remove
the comet from the tear.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.521
We can use it to travel to your

16:03.641 --> 16:05.552
universe and bring peace there,

16:05.752 --> 16:07.820
even to the Galra.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.900
Maybe you should think
about this, Allura.

16:12.990 --> 16:16.125
It wasn't that long ago that
we thought all Galra were bad.

16:16.245 --> 16:18.045
Maybe things aren't as black and white

16:18.165 --> 16:19.913
as she's making them out to be.

16:20.033 --> 16:22.830
Keith, these are my people,

16:22.910 --> 16:25.920
and they may be the strongest
allies we have in this war.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.360
I've tried every scan and
test I can think of.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.160
There's no sign of Voltron anywhere.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.370
How could I have stopped her?
You know how she is.

17:04.680 --> 17:07.040
I can't understand anything
that you're saying,

17:07.130 --> 17:09.920
but I'll assume by your tone
that that was an insult.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.300
Not good.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.560
You've done it, Allura.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.759
Soon, we'll use the comet to spread

17:24.878 --> 17:26.770
peace throughout every reality.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.900
What is going on?

17:30.980 --> 17:34.070
Empress, the Guns of Gamara
have infiltrated this ship.

17:34.190 --> 17:36.165
These people were working with them.

17:36.285 --> 17:38.272
Let our friends go!

17:38.392 --> 17:40.088
Hira, you and the rest of Altea

17:40.208 --> 17:42.040
have turned this universe

17:42.160 --> 17:43.910
into an army of slaves.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Peace at the sake of freedom!

17:46.120 --> 17:48.602
Slaves? Is this true?

17:48.722 --> 17:51.210
Non-cogs are not slaves!

17:51.290 --> 17:54.300
You're the ones who spread
chaos and destruction!

17:54.380 --> 17:57.220
We're going to scan
that little brain of yours

17:57.300 --> 18:00.390
and get every last rebel location.

18:00.470 --> 18:03.010
Finally, our wars can end.

18:03.247 --> 18:05.501
Allura, we cannot let this happen.

18:05.621 --> 18:07.350
Hira, please.

18:07.470 --> 18:09.500
We both want the same thing.

18:10.272 --> 18:11.690
Peace.

18:11.770 --> 18:13.230
Do we?

18:13.320 --> 18:15.900
Your weakness has brought
nothing but pain and suffering

18:15.990 --> 18:18.150
to your people at the
hands of the Galra.

18:18.240 --> 18:21.120
We have brought peace and order to ours.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.344
And, with this comet, we will bring our

18:23.464 --> 18:26.500
peace to every reality.

18:26.580 --> 18:28.500
You're no empress of mine.

18:29.580 --> 18:31.380
And you're no Altean.

18:35.050 --> 18:37.220
Why are you laughing?

18:37.300 --> 18:39.006
Because this is the reality where

18:39.126 --> 18:40.720
everything works out fine.

18:45.350 --> 18:48.270
Just in time.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.690
Dogpile!

18:59.990 --> 19:00.990
Let's go.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.880
- Pidge, which way to the lions?
- To the left!

19:17.300 --> 19:18.310
Huh?

19:29.230 --> 19:32.150
Sven! Are you okay? You saved my life!

19:34.020 --> 19:35.452
I'll be fine.

19:35.572 --> 19:37.707
Just get me to Space Hospital.

19:37.827 --> 19:40.332
They're blocking our way to the lions!

19:40.452 --> 19:42.570
Everyone, hang on!

19:52.920 --> 19:55.590
Does he do this in every reality?

19:55.670 --> 19:57.279
I'll take care of Sven.

19:57.399 --> 19:59.262
You just get to your lions!

20:03.550 --> 20:06.108
This is all my fault.
I activated the ship.

20:06.228 --> 20:07.970
They're going to dislodge the comet

20:08.060 --> 20:10.520
and have the power to
terrorize every reality.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.175
No, you can still get the
comet away from them.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.150
Pidge, scan for the comet.

20:15.230 --> 20:17.820
Yep. Already picked up
on its elemental signature.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.361
Everyone, we're going back in to get it.

20:20.481 --> 20:21.620
Form Voltron!

20:33.920 --> 20:36.080
Okay, now what?

20:36.170 --> 20:38.078
We need to find the
exact spot we came in

20:38.198 --> 20:40.413
or else we might not make it home.

20:41.442 --> 20:43.930
Take them down. Engage thrusters.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.090
Thrusters ready. Huh?

20:46.210 --> 20:47.728
What's happening?

20:47.848 --> 20:49.220
We've lost thrusters!

20:49.310 --> 20:50.680
We're unable to pursue!

20:51.770 --> 20:54.020
I love this reality!

20:54.100 --> 20:55.850
Take them out!

21:01.360 --> 21:02.490
I found it!

21:21.090 --> 21:22.920
No!

21:34.572 --> 21:36.339
You're back!

21:36.459 --> 21:38.900
Oh, thank the ancients!

21:38.980 --> 21:41.730
Paladins, can you hear me? Are you okay?

21:46.490 --> 21:50.160
Thank you for answering my
distress signal, Voltron.

21:58.790 --> 22:03.000
Paladins, can you hear me? Are you okay?

22:03.090 --> 22:05.340
Coran, we're here.

22:12.179 --> 22:14.457
Allura, you did the right thing.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.390
You couldn't let Hira get that ore.

22:17.688 --> 22:19.614
But now, Lotor has it.

22:20.157 --> 22:22.020
You didn't know.

22:22.110 --> 22:24.650
That is the problem. We never know.

22:24.770 --> 22:26.426
And that is exactly why my father sent

22:26.546 --> 22:28.570
the lions away so many years ago.

22:28.650 --> 22:31.160
To avoid this reality.

22:31.953 --> 22:33.707
I finally understand.

22:34.003 --> 22:36.062
We'll get it back.

22:36.262 --> 22:37.762
But if we don't?

22:37.882 --> 22:41.250
Lotor is always one step ahead of us.

22:41.330 --> 22:43.079
He has a plan for that ore,

22:43.374 --> 22:44.680
and if he succeeds,

22:44.800 --> 22:46.672
the Galra will finally have a weapon

22:46.792 --> 22:49.122
as powerful as Voltron.
