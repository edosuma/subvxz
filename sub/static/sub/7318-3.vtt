WEBVTT

00:12.367 --> 00:13.533
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:13.567 --> 00:15.400
DEREK'S MARRIED.

00:15.433 --> 00:18.067
YOU WAITED TWO MONTHS
TO TELL ME,

00:18.100 --> 00:19.700
AND I HAD TO FIND OUT
BY HER SHOWING UP

00:19.733 --> 00:21.267
AND TELLING ME HERSELF.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.633
YOU HAD BRAIN SURGERY
AND DIDN'T TELL ME?

00:23.667 --> 00:24.733
YOU CALLED MY WIFE?
YOU CALLED MINE.

00:24.767 --> 00:26.633
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DIVORCED.
PRACTICALLY DIVORCED.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.833
YOU'VE HAD
COUNSELING?
WE HAD ADULTERY.
THAT WAS ENOUGH.

00:28.867 --> 00:31.667
I THINK IT'S BEST
TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAK.
OH, YOU'RE ENDING THIS.

00:31.700 --> 00:33.400
I'M PREGNANT.

00:33.433 --> 00:36.233
HAVE YOU EVEN BOTHERED
TO TELL BURKE ABOUT THE BABY?

00:36.267 --> 00:38.167
THE CLINIC WOULDN'T LET ME
CONFIRM MY APPOINTMENT

00:38.200 --> 00:40.833
UNLESS I DESIGNATED
AN EMERGENCY CONTACT PERSON.

00:40.867 --> 00:42.033
YOU'RE MY PERSON.

00:42.067 --> 00:43.400
I AM?

00:43.433 --> 00:44.433
I HEARD YOUR MOTHER
WAS LEAVING MAYO.

00:44.467 --> 00:45.767
SHE GOIN' BACK
WITH THE U.N.?

00:45.800 --> 00:48.267
SHE'S, UH,
TAKING TIME OFF.

00:48.300 --> 00:49.500
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

00:49.533 --> 00:52.567
IT'S ME, MOM, MEREDITH.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.800
***

00:59.567 --> 01:03.600
OH, YOU ARE STUPID.
OH, GOD.

01:03.633 --> 01:05.767
YOU'RE A STUPID,
EVIL SADIST,

01:05.800 --> 01:07.333
AND I WANNA KILL YOU!

01:07.367 --> 01:08.733
ENDORPHINS ARE GOOD.

01:08.767 --> 01:10.267
ENDORPHINS
ARE MOOD ELEVATORS.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.200
THIS IS SUPPOSED
TO MAKE US FEEL BETTER.

01:12.233 --> 01:14.133
OH, GOD.
DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

01:14.167 --> 01:16.833
I'M STUPID.

01:16.867 --> 01:18.600
SLUTTY MISTRESS.

01:18.633 --> 01:20.267
PREGNANT WHORE.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.667
SLEEPING WITH OUR BOSSES
WAS A GREAT IDEA.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.733
OH.

01:25.767 --> 01:27.667
YOU KNOW WHAT'S RUINED
FOR ME?

01:27.700 --> 01:29.267
OH.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.300
FERRY BOATS.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.233
I USED TO LOVE
FERRY BOATS.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.167
AND DEREK'S GOT
A THING FOR FERRY BOATS.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.500
NOW EVERY TIME I SEE
A FREAKIN' FERRY BOAT--

01:37.533 --> 01:39.133
YOU KNOW WHAT'S RUINED
FOR ME?

01:39.167 --> 01:41.467
CORONARY ARTERY
BYPASS GRAFTS

01:41.500 --> 01:43.633
AND AORTIC ANEURYSMS.

01:43.667 --> 01:46.600
GOD, I USED TO LOVE
AORTIC ANEURYSMS.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.067
(Meredith) SURGEONS
ARE CONTROL FREAKS.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.800
WITH A SCALPEL IN YOUR HAND...

01:52.833 --> 01:54.367
OH, CRAP.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.400
YOU FEEL UNSTOPPABLE.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.333
THERE'S NO FEAR,
THERE'S NO PAIN.

01:59.367 --> 02:00.667
HAVE YOU CRIED YET?

02:00.700 --> 02:02.100
HELLO.

02:02.133 --> 02:04.467
YOU'RE 10 FEET TALL
AND BULLETPROOF.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.800
DO YOU THINK WE'D FEEL BETTER
IF WE CRY?

02:06.833 --> 02:09.400
YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE,
LET IT OUT?

02:09.433 --> 02:10.800
PROBABLY, YEAH.

02:10.833 --> 02:13.067
AND THEN YOU LEAVE
THE O.R...

02:14.633 --> 02:17.233
YOU WANNA CRY NOW?

02:17.267 --> 02:18.200
NO.

02:18.233 --> 02:20.333
OKAY, LET'S--LET'S JOG.

02:20.367 --> 02:21.633
AND ALL THAT PERFECTION,

02:21.667 --> 02:25.067
ALL THAT BEAUTIFUL CONTROL

02:25.100 --> 02:27.700
JUST FALLS TO CRAP.

02:27.733 --> 02:29.767
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

02:29.800 --> 02:33.333
SHE'S HANGING OUT
WITH ALEX.

02:33.367 --> 02:35.300
WHY?

02:37.233 --> 02:38.433
I DON'T KNOW.

02:38.467 --> 02:42.200
I THINK--THINK THEY,
UH, MIGHT BE FRIENDS.

02:42.233 --> 02:44.533
DO ANOTHER ONE.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.800
(whispers) MAKE THE LAMBS
STOP SCREAMING.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.800
YOU GUYS ARE WRONG
ABOUT HIM, ALL RIGHT?

02:53.833 --> 02:55.733
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM,
HE'S REALLY SWEET.

02:55.767 --> 02:57.333
HE'S ALEX.
PUNK-ASS.

02:57.367 --> 02:59.267
HEY, GREY,
IZZIE WAS TELLING ME

02:59.300 --> 03:01.433
YOU HAVE TAPES OF YOUR MOM
PERFORMING SURGERY.

03:01.467 --> 03:03.367
I'D KILL TO SEE
THE ELLIS GREY IN ACTION.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.400
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE
YOU CAN COME OVER TONIGHT

03:05.433 --> 03:07.333
AND WE CAN ALL WATCH IT
TOGETHER, RIGHT?

03:07.367 --> 03:09.233
OH, YEAH, IF THIS
WERE A HELL DIMENSION.

03:09.267 --> 03:10.733
(Cristina)
RUN AWAY, PIG BOY.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.833
YOU HAVE A THING
FOR ALEX?

03:12.867 --> 03:14.500
NO.
(Cristina) OH.

03:14.533 --> 03:15.467
I DON'T.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.400
ARE WE SAVING LIVES
OR HAVING A TEA PARTY?

03:18.433 --> 03:19.467
WALK FASTER, PEOPLE.

03:28.567 --> 03:30.800
AHEM.

03:30.833 --> 03:32.300
NICE HAT.

03:32.333 --> 03:33.667
SHUT UP.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.067
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE?

03:35.100 --> 03:36.333
I'M GOING BACK TO WORK.

03:36.367 --> 03:37.667
YOU'RE NOT CLEARED
FOR SURGERY.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.067
LEAVE ME ALONE.

03:39.100 --> 03:40.700
I'VE BEEN SITTIN' HOME
FOR A WEEK,

03:40.733 --> 03:42.533
WATCHING OPRAH GIVE AWAY
THINGS ON TV.

03:44.567 --> 03:47.300
YOU CLEAR ME NOW,
OR I'LL HURT YOU.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.233
IF YOU WANT ME
TO CLEAR YOU SO SOON,

03:49.267 --> 03:51.067
YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THAT
BEFORE YOU GAVE CHIEF TO BURKE

03:51.100 --> 03:53.800
AND INVITED SATAN
TO SEATTLE.
SATAN?

03:53.833 --> 03:56.800
GOOD MORNING.
RICHARD, LIKE THE HAT.

03:56.833 --> 03:58.100
SATAN SPEAKS.

03:58.133 --> 04:00.067
ACTUALLY,
I PREFER TO BE CALLED

04:00.067 --> 04:02.700
RULER OF ALL THAT IS EVIL,
BUT I WILL ANSWER TO SATAN.

04:02.733 --> 04:05.167
WHAT IS
SHE STILL DOING HERE?
I ASKED HER TO STAY.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.100
WE HAVE A PEDIATRIC
SURGERY ATTENDING

04:07.133 --> 04:08.467
ON MATERNITY LEAVE.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.333
ACTUALLY, I COULD
USE YOU ON A CONSULT.

04:11.367 --> 04:13.233
WILL YOU MEET ME
UP THERE, DEREK?

04:13.267 --> 04:15.133
YEAH, FINE.
SEE YOU, RICHARD.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.367
NICE LADY.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.067
I'M NOT CLEARING YOU
FOR SURGERY.

04:18.067 --> 04:19.800
FINE, I CAN CATCH UP
ON MY PAPERWORK.

04:19.833 --> 04:22.267
(chuckles)

04:22.300 --> 04:24.200
MR. GASTON IS SCHEDULED
FOR A RESECTION

04:24.233 --> 04:25.567
NON-SMALL CELL CARCINOMA
TODAY.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.533
HE DID WELL OVERNIGHT,
HAS REMAINED AFEBRILE.

04:27.567 --> 04:30.067
HE'S HAD A DOSE
OF CEFTRIAXONE THIS MORNING.

04:30.067 --> 04:31.667
HIS PRE-OP LABS
ARE UNREMARKABLE.

04:31.700 --> 04:35.500
HIS CHEST X-RAYS ARE UNCHANGED
FROM THE PREVIOUS.

04:35.533 --> 04:37.700
I OWN A COUPLE
OF DRY CLEANING STORES.

04:37.733 --> 04:39.633
I NEVER BELIEVED
WHAT THEY SAID

04:39.667 --> 04:41.233
ABOUT INHALING
THE CHEMICALS, BUT...

04:41.267 --> 04:43.167
WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING
WE CAN FOR YOU, MR. GASTON.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.800
DID ONCOLOGY SEE HIM YET?

04:46.167 --> 04:48.333
THEY'RE WAITING
FOR THE SURGICAL PATH.

04:48.367 --> 04:50.200
THANK YOU, DR. YANG.

04:50.233 --> 04:51.667
YOU'RE WELCOME,
DR. BURKE.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.600
I KNOW,
AND I JUST THINK

04:53.633 --> 04:55.533
YOU SHOULD STILL TELL HIM
ABOUT THE BABY

04:55.567 --> 04:57.467
BECAUSE AT LEAST
HE SHOULD HAVE

04:57.500 --> 04:59.433
THE RESPONSIBILITY
OF HAVING TO PAY.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.367
NO! LOOK, HE WILL
NEVER KNOW. IT'S OVER.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.300
ONCE THIS PREGNANCY'S
TAKEN CARE OF,

05:03.333 --> 05:05.233
BURKE WON'T EVEN BE
A BLIP ON MY RADAR.

05:05.267 --> 05:07.167
HE'LL BE A SMUDGE.
RIGHT.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.700
YOU KNOW, MEREDITH,

05:08.733 --> 05:10.633
LEAVE THE SARCASM
UP TO ME.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.067
REALLY.
IT DOESN'T SUIT YOU.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.667
KELLY ROCHE,
23 YEARS OLD,

05:15.700 --> 05:18.500
IN FOR A SCHEDULED E.T.S.
FOR TREATMENT OF ERYTHROPHOBIA

05:18.533 --> 05:20.067
WITH HYPERPYREXIA.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.400
ERYTHROPHOBIA?
BLUSHING.

05:21.433 --> 05:24.167
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE PROCEDURE?

05:24.200 --> 05:26.167
DOCTOR...

05:26.200 --> 05:28.133
(sighs)

05:28.167 --> 05:29.367
DR. SHEPHERD
EXPLAINED EVERYTHING.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.233
HE WAS VERY... HELPFUL.

05:32.267 --> 05:35.333
HE GAVE ME SOME LITERA--
SORRY.

05:35.367 --> 05:37.633
DON'T BE. HALF THE PATIENTS
THAT COME THROUGH HERE

05:37.667 --> 05:39.067
HAVE THE HOTS FOR SHEPHERD.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.067
DR. KAREV.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.467
WHAT?

05:42.500 --> 05:43.667
IT'S TRUE.

05:45.267 --> 05:47.167
HEY.
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.233
WHAT?

05:48.267 --> 05:50.333
ACT LIKE AN ASS WHEN EVERYBODY
BUT ME IS AROUND.

05:50.367 --> 05:52.267
THEY HATE YOU ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.400
SO? WHAT?

05:53.433 --> 05:56.167
HEY, THERE'S A NEW SURGICAL CASE
COMING UP FROM THE PIT,

05:56.200 --> 05:57.733
LIKELY DIVERTICULITIS.
LET'S GO.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.100
YOU COMIN'?

05:59.133 --> 06:00.167
YEAH.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.300
(Ellis) WATCH IT.
HANDS OFF ME.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.233
I COULD REPORT YOU
TO THE CHIEF

06:04.267 --> 06:06.167
AND YOU'D BE OUT
ON YOUR ASS!

06:06.200 --> 06:07.767
WHERE IS THE CHIEF?!

06:07.800 --> 06:09.833
PATIENT'S NAME IS, UM...
WHERE IS THE CHIEF?
YOU'RE ALL AMATEURS!

06:09.867 --> 06:12.600
COMPLAINING OF INTERMITTENT
CRAMPING, PAIN AND DIARRHEA.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.067
ALSO SUFFERS FROM...

06:15.067 --> 06:16.600
AMATEURS!

06:16.633 --> 06:18.367
ALZHEIMER'S.
(Miranda)
THE PATIENT'S NAME?

06:18.400 --> 06:19.333
UM...

06:19.367 --> 06:21.733
COME ON, YANG,
THE PATIENT'S NAME?

06:21.767 --> 06:24.633
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:24.667 --> 06:26.567
HAVEN'T I TOLD YOU?
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU

06:26.600 --> 06:28.833
NOT TO BOTHER ME
WHEN I'M AT WORK?!
ELLIS GREY.

06:28.867 --> 06:30.367
(George) MEREDITH'S MOTHER.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.367
AMATEURS!
YOU'RE AMATEURS!

06:34.467 --> 06:38.300
***

06:38.333 --> 06:41.800
* NOBODY KNOWS
WHERE THEY MIGHT END UP *

06:41.833 --> 06:45.267
* NOBODY KNOWS

06:53.500 --> 06:54.633
* OH, OH

06:54.667 --> 06:58.600
* SUPPOSE YOU'LL NEVER KNOW

07:00.800 --> 07:05.267
LEAVE HER ALONE.
(all talking at once)

07:05.300 --> 07:06.500
STOP IT, STOP IT,
STOP IT!

07:06.533 --> 07:08.800
MEREDITH, ARE YOU OKAY--

07:08.833 --> 07:10.333
DR. KAREV, STICK WITH
THE E.T.S. CASE.

07:10.367 --> 07:11.700
AND, ALEX,

07:11.733 --> 07:13.767
HER BLUSHING IMPULSE--
NOT A TOY FOR YOU TO PLAY WITH

07:13.800 --> 07:15.700
OR A BUTTON FOR YOU TO PUSH,
UNDERSTOOD?

07:15.733 --> 07:17.633
HEY, MEREDITH,
YOU KNOW, UM,

07:17.667 --> 07:19.567
MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER,
SHE DIED WITH ALZHEIMER'S.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.500
MY GOD.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

07:21.533 --> 07:23.300
LOOK, I'M JUST
TRYIN' TO HELP.

07:23.333 --> 07:24.533
(Miranda) IZZIE,
THE DR. SHEPHERDS

07:24.567 --> 07:26.467
NEED AN INTERN
UP IN THE N.I.C.U.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.100
WAIT, BOTH OF THEM,
TOGETHER?

07:29.133 --> 07:31.833
AND ME, BY MYSELF,
WITH THE TWO MARRIED PEOPLE

07:31.867 --> 07:34.300
WHO HATE EACH OTHER?
GO.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.833
CRISTINA, YOU'RE ON
THE THORACOTOMY.
OH, WITH BURKE?

07:36.867 --> 07:38.700
OH, CAN I HAVE THE HATEFUL
MARRIED COUPLE INSTEAD?

07:38.733 --> 07:39.767
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.067
I THOUGHT I WAS YOUR RESIDENT,
NOT YOUR HOSTESS.

07:42.067 --> 07:44.567
I ASSIGN, YOU TAKE.
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

07:44.600 --> 07:46.500
IS THERE SOME REASON
WHY IT'S INCONVENIENT FOR YOU

07:46.533 --> 07:48.767
TO SPEND THE DAY IN THE O.R.
LEARNING FROM DR. BURKE?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.700
NO, I'M VERY HAPPY
TO BE WORKING WITH DR. BURKE.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.233
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.067
GEORGE, TAKE CARE
OF DR. GREY.

07:54.100 --> 07:57.300
YES. THANK YOU.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.400
SHE NEEDS A FRIEND
RIGHT NOW--

07:59.433 --> 08:01.200
OH, YOU MEAN

08:01.233 --> 08:02.600
ELLIS THE...

08:04.800 --> 08:06.567
MOTHER.

08:10.367 --> 08:12.500
ARE YOU ABLE TO WORK TODAY?

08:12.533 --> 08:14.233
YES, I'M FINE.

08:14.267 --> 08:17.833
'CAUSE I WOULD UNDERSTAND IT IF
YOU WANTED TO BE WITH YOUR--

08:17.867 --> 08:21.067
NO. MY MOTHER AND I
DON'T HAVE THE EASIEST...

08:21.100 --> 08:24.667
IT'S JUST BETTER
IF I'M WORKING.

08:24.700 --> 08:26.667
OKAY.
YOU'RE ON SCUT.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.600
EXCUSE ME?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.133
WHILE WE TAKE CARE
OF YOUR MOTHER,

08:30.167 --> 08:31.767
YOU CAN CATCH UP
ON CHARTING,

08:31.800 --> 08:34.233
RUN SAMPLES TO THE LAB,
GO OVER--

08:34.267 --> 08:35.533
I TOLD YOU, I'M FINE.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.467
YEAH, AND I APPRECIATE
THAT YOU'RE FINE.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.400
BUT I HAVE TO ANTICIPATE
A CERTAIN LEVEL

08:39.433 --> 08:41.100
OF DISTRACTION FROM YOU TODAY,

08:41.133 --> 08:42.567
EVEN IN THE FACE
OF ALL THAT FINENESS.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.500
SO SCUT, NOW.

08:46.733 --> 08:48.233
(Derek) WHERE'S THE MOTHER?

08:48.267 --> 08:49.600
(Addison) GONE.

08:49.633 --> 08:52.500
SHE STUCK AROUND LONG ENOUGH
TO GET THE KID STRUNG OUT,

08:52.533 --> 08:53.700
AND THEN TOOK OFF.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.400
NICE, HUH?
ADDISON...

08:55.433 --> 08:57.367
DEREK, I KNOW
IT'S A LONG SHOT.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.300
I KNOW THAT.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.433
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD
A NEWBORN WITH AN INVASIVE MASS.

09:01.467 --> 09:03.367
YOU FAILED TO MENTION
SHE'S PREMATURE, UNDERWEIGHT

09:03.400 --> 09:05.067
AND ADDICTED TO NARCOTICS.

09:05.067 --> 09:07.733
THERE IS NO WAY THAT THIS CHILD
IS GONNA SURVIVE SPINAL SURGERY.

09:07.767 --> 09:08.800
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.633
EVEN IF SHE DOES,
SHE'S A MESS.

09:10.667 --> 09:12.100
LOOK AT HER, SHE'S GOT
MENINGITIS SEIZURES.

09:12.133 --> 09:14.533
SHE'S JUST GONNA LIVE
A SHORT AND PAINFUL LIFE.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

09:14.567 --> 09:16.467
IT IS MY JOB TO KNOW THAT.
YOU'RE NOT GOD, DEREK.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.567
EXCUSE ME?
I'M SORRY, HONEY,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.367
YOU DON'T GET TO JUST DECIDE--
DID YOU JUST CALL ME "HONEY"?

09:21.400 --> 09:23.300
DON'T CALL ME HONEY.
FINE. YOU'RE NOT GOD,
DR. SHEPHERD.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.200
LOOK, IF A PATIENT HAS
ANY CHANCE AT SURVIVAL,

09:25.233 --> 09:27.667
WHICH I THINK SHE DOES, THEN
YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY--

09:27.700 --> 09:30.200
DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY.
YOU TOOK AN OATH, DEREK.

09:30.233 --> 09:32.333
OH, AND DON'T YOU DARE
TALK TO ME ABOUT OATHS.

09:32.367 --> 09:34.767
DEREK, I MESSED UP.
PEOPLE MESS UP.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.567
YOU SLEPT WITH MY BEST FRIEND
IN MY FAVORITE SHEETS.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.633
THE FLANNEL SHEETS?
YOU HATE THE FLANNEL SHEETS.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.400
NO, I LOVED THOSE SHEETS.
I DID.
YOU LIKE THE ITALIAN SHEETS
WITH THE PAISLEYS.

09:41.433 --> 09:43.333
WOULD YOU JUST STOP
TALKING ABOUT THE SHEETS?
FINE.

09:43.367 --> 09:46.500
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST GONNA GO.
I'LL GO CHECK ON THE LABS.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.100
ADDISON, DON'T DO THAT.

09:50.133 --> 09:52.633
DEREK, LOOK, SHE'S A FIGHTER.
LOOK HOW FAR SHE'S COME ALREADY.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.433
DON'T GET ATTACHED,
DON'T GET INVOLVED.

09:54.467 --> 09:56.767
JUST DON'T MAKE HER LIFE
MORE PAINFUL THAN IT ALREADY IS.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.300
DEREK, PLEASE.
SHE HAS NOBODY.

09:58.333 --> 10:01.633
SHE NEEDS SOMEONE
TO FIGHT FOR HER.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.200
SHE'S TOO FAR GONE.

10:03.233 --> 10:06.100
WE HAVE TO LET HER GO.
LET HER GO IN PEACE.

10:06.133 --> 10:09.533
FINE, DEREK. WALK AWAY.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.733
IT'S WHAT YOU DO BEST.

10:13.767 --> 10:14.967
I'VE ENJOYED THE OPPORTUNITY

10:15.000 --> 10:18.400
TO SHOW YOU MY CAPABILITIES
IN THIS ARENA, HOWEVER BRIEF.

10:18.433 --> 10:20.133
STOP FISHING, PRESTON.

10:20.167 --> 10:22.267
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.267
BUT I'M BACK NOW,
AND I DON'T PLAN

10:24.300 --> 10:26.600
ON GOING ANYWHERE
ANYTIME SOON.

10:26.633 --> 10:28.667
I AM GLAD
THAT YOU'RE BACK.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.367
I'M JUST HIDING MY JOY

10:30.400 --> 10:32.667
DEEP DOWN INSIDE.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.467
AND, UH, CHIEF...

10:38.233 --> 10:40.400
THE HAT...

10:40.433 --> 10:43.333
IT'S A LITTLE PIMPED OUT.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.533
WELCOME BACK, CHIEF.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.433
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK,
DR. GREY.

10:52.467 --> 10:54.367
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

10:54.400 --> 10:56.500
IT'S MY MOTHER, SIR.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.767
I'M SORRY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU SOONER.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.700
I KNOW YOU TWO ARE CLOSE,

11:11.733 --> 11:13.567
BUT SHE MADE ME PROMISE.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.100
SHE SEEMS TO BE RELIVING

11:15.133 --> 11:19.133
THE HEYDAY OF HER RESIDENCY
A LOT THESE DAYS.

11:19.167 --> 11:21.700
AND I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE
IF YOU COULD STOP BY

11:21.733 --> 11:23.233
AND SAY HELLO,

11:23.267 --> 11:25.767
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO HER.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.600
OH, OF--OF COURSE.
OF COURSE.

11:29.633 --> 11:32.333
DO YOU NEED A DAY OFF
OR A...

11:32.367 --> 11:33.733
OH, NO.

11:33.767 --> 11:35.733
I'M FINE.

11:35.767 --> 11:37.700
YEAH.

11:37.733 --> 11:40.067
OKAY.

11:43.733 --> 11:45.733
IF YOU COULD JUST HOLD--

11:45.767 --> 11:47.767
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY WORKDAY, THATCH.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.467
THATCH? NO, I'M DR. O'MALLEY.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.367
I'M...

11:51.400 --> 11:53.200
OKAY.

11:56.833 --> 11:58.733
DARLING, I'M NOT IN THE MOOD
TO PLAY DOCTOR NOW.

11:58.767 --> 11:59.733
HANDS OFF. I'M BUSY.

11:59.767 --> 12:01.167
(whispers) GEORGE.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.233
DAMN IT, THATCH,
I MEAN IT. NO!

12:03.267 --> 12:04.667
GEORGE.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.267
SHE'S ALLERGIC
TO PENICILLIN.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.800
YEAH? OH, YEAH.
IT SAID IN HER CHART.
OH.

12:18.833 --> 12:21.100
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

12:21.133 --> 12:24.233
OKAY. DO YOU, UM,
WHO'S THATCH?

12:24.267 --> 12:28.800
MY DAD THATCHER.

12:28.833 --> 12:31.333
WHAT DID SHE--
IS SHE--

12:31.367 --> 12:33.100
IS SHE TALKING ABOUT HIM?

12:33.133 --> 12:36.233
UM, YEAH.

12:36.267 --> 12:37.600
SHE NEVER TALKS ABOUT HIM.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.133
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:39.167 --> 12:40.500
NO. YEAH, YEAH.
I'M GOOD.

12:40.533 --> 12:41.467
OKAY.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.067
UM... I CAN'T BE HERE.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.367
OF COURSE.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.100
I MEAN, WE'RE GOOD HERE.
WE'RE GREAT.
OKAY.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.400
SO... OKAY.

12:56.833 --> 12:59.600
(George)
CAN I PLEASE...

12:59.633 --> 13:01.333
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

13:09.467 --> 13:11.700
DR. SHEPHERD.

13:11.733 --> 13:13.333
MEREDITH.

13:13.367 --> 13:14.833
I HEARD. IS IT TRUE?

13:14.867 --> 13:15.833
YEAH.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.600
SECRET'S OUT.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.367
DR. SHEPHERD, I--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL ME
DR. SHEPHERD.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.767
DR. SHEPHERD,
I WANT IN ON A SURGICAL CASE.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.133
I CAN'T JUST DO NOTHING
ALL DAY.

13:26.167 --> 13:28.567
AND YOU OWE ME THIS.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.833
AND I NEVER ASK YOU
FOR ANYTHING LIKE THIS, SO...

13:31.867 --> 13:34.767
I HAVE AN E.T.S.
THIS AFTERNOON.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.767
YOU'LL SCRUB IN.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.200
YOU'RE LATE.

13:48.233 --> 13:49.467
I APOLOGIZE.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.100
I'M JUST STARTING TO DISSECT
AROUND MR. GASTON'S TUMOR.

13:59.133 --> 14:02.333
I'VE ALMOST GOT
VISUALIZATION.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.200
HEY, KELLY.

14:12.233 --> 14:14.133
DR. SHEP--

14:14.167 --> 14:15.100
DR. SHEPHERD.

14:15.133 --> 14:17.533
GOD. SORRY.

14:17.567 --> 14:19.067
DAMN IT.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.433
KELLY.
YEAH.

14:20.467 --> 14:21.800
KELLY.
MM-HMM.

14:21.833 --> 14:24.733
THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME
THAT THAT EVER HAPPENS.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.500
HOW ARE HER LABS?

14:26.533 --> 14:27.733
H AND H ARE STABLE,

14:27.767 --> 14:29.400
CHEST X-RAYS SHOW
NO ACUTE PROCESS.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.367
GOOD.
YOU READY TO GO?

14:31.400 --> 14:32.433
ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:32.467 --> 14:34.233
I'VE BEEN READY
SINCE THE THIRD GRADE.

14:34.267 --> 14:36.333
DID YOU READ THE LITERATURE
I GAVE YOU?

14:36.367 --> 14:38.267
YOU UNDERSTAND
THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS?

14:38.300 --> 14:39.133
COMPENSATORY SWEATING

14:39.167 --> 14:41.200
OF THE BACK, ABDOMEN,
THIGHS AND LEGS,

14:41.233 --> 14:43.067
POSSIBLE GUSTATORY SWEATING.

14:43.067 --> 14:45.200
HORNER'S SYNDROME OCCURS
IN LESS THAN 1% OF PATIENTS.

14:45.233 --> 14:46.733
BRACHIAL PLEXUS INJURY,

14:46.767 --> 14:50.200
PNEUMOTHORAX AND HEMOTHORAX
ARE HIGHLY UNLIKELY,

14:50.233 --> 14:52.700
BUT POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
OF THE SURGERY.

14:52.733 --> 14:54.367
YOU DID YOUR HOMEWORK.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.600
TAKE HER TO PRE-OP.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.267
I'LL ALERT THE O.R.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.800
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT ALL THOSE WORDS MEAN?

14:59.833 --> 15:01.333
BRACHIAL PLEXUS INJURY

15:01.367 --> 15:03.267
COULD CAUSE PARALYSIS
OF THE ARMS.

15:03.300 --> 15:06.133
PNEUMOTHORAX
IS A COLLAPSED LUNG.

15:06.167 --> 15:09.200
I KNOW.

15:09.233 --> 15:11.733
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO RISK ALL OF THAT

15:11.767 --> 15:13.633
OVER A LITTLE BIT
OF BLUSHING?

15:13.667 --> 15:17.567
IS THAT...
WHAT YOU THINK THIS IS,

15:17.600 --> 15:19.833
A LITTLE BIT OF BLUSHING?

15:19.867 --> 15:23.233
JUST
A SCHOOLGIRL EMBARRASSMENT?

15:23.267 --> 15:25.200
LOOK, YOU BOTH SAW
WHAT HAPPENED

15:25.233 --> 15:26.400
WHEN DR. SHEP--

15:26.433 --> 15:28.600
WHEN DR. SHEPHERD WAS HERE.

15:28.633 --> 15:30.100
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

15:30.133 --> 15:32.333
WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU LIKED HIM.

15:32.367 --> 15:34.267
I DO, BUT YOU THINK
I WANT A--

15:34.300 --> 15:36.833
A ROOMFUL OF DOCTORS
TO KNOW ABOUT IT?

15:36.867 --> 15:39.267
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GONNA...

15:39.300 --> 15:40.600
IT'S NOT JUST YOU GUYS.

15:40.633 --> 15:42.100
IT'S NOT JUST THIS ONCE.

15:42.133 --> 15:43.467
IT HAPPENS...

15:43.500 --> 15:50.067
EVERY TIME I HAVE A FEELING
FOR ANYONE IN MY LIFE.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.467
I CAN'T GET MAD,

15:56.500 --> 15:59.367
I CAN'T... BE HAPPY,

15:59.400 --> 16:03.067
I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING WITHOUT
THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWING.

16:03.067 --> 16:05.500
I CAN'T HAVE A SECRET.

16:05.533 --> 16:07.067
CAN YOU...

16:07.067 --> 16:09.400
IMAGINE LIVING THAT WAY
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE?

16:09.433 --> 16:11.633
***

16:11.667 --> 16:13.167
(glass shatters)

16:13.200 --> 16:15.233
GET AWAY FROM ME,
YOU INSIPID LITTLE MAN!

16:15.267 --> 16:18.067
DR. GREY, CALM DOWN.
GET OUT OF HERE!
GET OUT OF MY ROOM!

16:18.100 --> 16:19.800
PLEASE CALM DOWN.
GET AWAY FROM MY HOUSE!

16:19.833 --> 16:21.500
WHAT CAN I DO?
PLEASE GET SOME HALOPERIDOL.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.667
DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.833
THAT SAD LITTLE,
SOULFUL LITTLE PUPPY ROUTINE.

16:25.867 --> 16:28.433
I KNOW IT BY HEART, THATCH,
AND I'M OVER IT.

16:28.467 --> 16:31.067
I DON'T WANNA HEAR ABOUT
YOUR DAY OR YOUR STUDENTS

16:31.067 --> 16:33.333
OR YOUR PATHETIC
LITTLE RESEARCH GRANTS.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.500
MY...

16:35.533 --> 16:37.600
MY WORK IS WHAT COUNTS!

16:37.633 --> 16:39.300
IT'S WHAT PAYS
FOR THIS HOUSE.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.067
IT PAYS FOR--
IT PAYS FOR YOU

16:41.100 --> 16:42.833
AND IT PAYS FOR--
IT PAYS FOR MEREDITH

16:42.867 --> 16:44.733
AND FOR YOUR
PRECIOUS LIFESTYLE.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.333
SO WHY DON'T YOU

16:46.367 --> 16:49.500
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE
AND LET ME DO IT?!

16:50.600 --> 16:52.467
MEREDITH MAY THINK
SHE NEEDS YOU,

16:52.500 --> 16:54.400
BUT I SURE AS HELL DON'T.

16:54.433 --> 16:57.100
(George) DR. GREY.
(Nurse) HERE IT IS.

16:57.133 --> 16:59.067
(Ellis) JUST GET AWAY
FROM ME, THATCHER.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.400
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

17:00.433 --> 17:02.400
***

17:02.433 --> 17:04.200
(Kelly) ARE YOU OKAY?

17:05.600 --> 17:08.133
(sighs)

17:08.167 --> 17:12.533
THAT'S SOMETHING
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE ASKING YOU.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.433
(Richard) O'MALLEY.

17:25.467 --> 17:27.367
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
WORKING ON ELLIS GREY.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.300
YES, SIR.
I'M TRYIN' MY BEST.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.233
ALL RIGHT, KEEP ME INFORMED
OF HER PROGRESS

17:31.267 --> 17:33.167
AND TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.100
SHE'S AN OLD FRIEND
OF MINE.

17:35.133 --> 17:37.067
REALLY? BECAUSE, ACTUALLY,
I COULD USE SOME HELP.

17:37.067 --> 17:38.567
COULD--COULD YOU HELP ME
EXAMINE HER?

17:38.600 --> 17:42.567
UH, UM, I'M JUST
A LITTLE BUSY JUST NOW.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.333
GOTTA RUN.

17:43.367 --> 17:44.733
RIGHT, OKAY.

17:44.767 --> 17:47.200
IT'S JUST THAT SHE SEEMS
TO THINK I'M HER EX-HUSBAND

17:47.233 --> 17:49.233
AND SHE WON'T LET ME
TOUCH HER.

17:51.767 --> 17:55.200
FUNNY. YOU--YOU DO LOOK
A BIT LIKE THATCHER. YEAH.

17:55.233 --> 17:58.133
I LOOK LIKE MEREDITH'S DAD?

17:58.167 --> 18:02.100
UM, JUST TAKE GOOD CARE
OF HER, GEORGE.

18:02.133 --> 18:06.733
BUT I LOOK LIKE
MEREDITH'S DAD?

18:06.767 --> 18:09.233
I NEED HELP.

18:09.267 --> 18:10.200
HEY.

18:10.233 --> 18:11.167
HEY.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.400
HEY, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT.

18:12.433 --> 18:13.367
WHAT?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.067
YOU HAVE AN EYELASH.

18:15.067 --> 18:17.100
MAKE A WISH
AND BLOW IT AWAY.

18:17.133 --> 18:18.400
HEY, NURSE RATCHED,

18:18.433 --> 18:20.700
THERE'S A DEAD GUY
STINKIN' UP ROOM 4125.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.600
DO SOMETHIN'
BEFORE HE ROTS.

18:23.633 --> 18:26.167
SEE? THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.400
WHAT?

18:27.433 --> 18:29.333
WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID
OF SHOWING PEOPLE

18:29.367 --> 18:31.267
THAT YOU'RE A DECENT
HUMAN BEING?

18:31.300 --> 18:33.200
REMEMBER WHEN HE
WALLPAPERED THE HOSPITAL

18:33.233 --> 18:35.133
WITH PICTURES OF YOU
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR?

18:35.167 --> 18:36.367
YEAH.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.067
YEAH, I DO.

18:38.067 --> 18:39.800
THAT WAS BEFORE
I KNEW YOU.

18:39.833 --> 18:41.200
THANKS, MAN.
VERY HELPFUL.

18:41.233 --> 18:43.133
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME
DO AN EXAM

18:43.167 --> 18:44.633
ON MEREDITH'S MOM.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.067
OH, A STANDARD EXAM.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.800
YOU DID GO
TO MED SCHOOL, RIGHT?

18:47.833 --> 18:50.067
SHE THINKS I'M HER EX-HUSBAND.
SHE WON'T LET ME.

18:51.633 --> 18:52.733
DR. GREY.

18:52.767 --> 18:54.667
OH, DAMN IT, THATCHER,
I'M AT WORK.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.767
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU.
I'M TOO BUSY TO DEAL WITH YOU.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.633
NOW NO MORE CARTOONS.
SHE MEANS INTERRUPTIONS.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.300
NO MORE INTERRUPTIONS,
THATCH.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.833
YOU HEARD THE DOCTOR.

19:01.867 --> 19:03.200
HI, I'M--I'M DR. KAREV.

19:03.233 --> 19:05.133
PLEASED TO MEET YOU,
DR. GREY.

19:05.167 --> 19:07.067
I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED
YOUR WORK.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.333
SO YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH
THE LAPAROSCOPIC GREY METHOD?

19:09.367 --> 19:12.567
OH, I STUDIED FOOTAGE OF
THE OPERATION YOU PIONEERED.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.667
YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.700
GOOD. WELL, THEN,
WE'RE WASTING TIME.

19:16.733 --> 19:18.700
LET'S SCRUB IN.

19:18.733 --> 19:21.133
WELL, DR. GREY, I'M GONNA
NEED TO DO A SHORT EXAM

19:21.167 --> 19:22.367
BEFORE YOU START SURGERY.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.067
I KNOW.

19:24.067 --> 19:26.133
NEW HOSPITAL POLICY.
ANNOYING BUREAUCRATS.

19:26.167 --> 19:28.500
MAKE IT QUICK.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.433
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT OUTSIDE,
THATCHER?

19:30.467 --> 19:32.367
I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.633
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.233
SHE'S GOT A GOOD GRIP.

19:46.267 --> 19:47.500
YEAH.

19:47.533 --> 19:51.100
I DON'T THINK I--
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.133
SHE'S GOT A RESISTANT STRAIN
OF PNEUMOCOCCUS.

19:55.167 --> 19:57.833
THE ANTIBIOTICS
AREN'T WORKING.

19:57.867 --> 20:00.233
YOU MAY WANNA GET YOURSELF
REASSIGNED, DR. STEVENS.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.800
I DON'T THINK
WE'LL BE OPERATING TODAY.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.567
SO DO YOU THINK
DR. SHEPHERD WAS RIGHT?

20:04.600 --> 20:08.633
IT'S JUST TOO FAR GONE.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.767
SHE DOES HAVE A GOOD GRIP.

20:13.533 --> 20:15.533
***

20:15.567 --> 20:20.100
(Preston) THE TUMOR HAS
INFILTRATED THE PERICARDIUM.

20:26.867 --> 20:28.100
YANG.

20:30.067 --> 20:32.433
YANG?

20:32.467 --> 20:34.233
WHAT? SORRY.

20:34.267 --> 20:36.467
IS MY SURGERY INTERFERING
WITH YOUR DAYDREAMING?

20:36.500 --> 20:38.567
NO.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.033
SORRY.

20:51.633 --> 20:52.800
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?

20:52.833 --> 20:53.767
NO.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.467
YOU HAVE A MOCHA LATTE?

20:55.500 --> 20:56.367
NO.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.300
THEN GO AWAY.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.233
ACTUALLY, I NEED
A NEW ASSIGNMENT.

21:01.267 --> 21:04.067
THE SHEPHERDS' PREEMIE CASE
IS NON-SURGICAL.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.233
NON-SURGICAL?

21:05.267 --> 21:06.733
NON-OPERABLE.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.733
THAT SUCKS.

21:09.767 --> 21:10.767
YEAH.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.667
DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT ELLIS GREY?

21:13.700 --> 21:14.633
DID MEREDITH TELL YOU?

21:14.667 --> 21:16.300
NO.

21:16.333 --> 21:19.200
IT'S JUST YOU THINK--
YOU THINK YOU KNOW SOMEONE,

21:19.233 --> 21:21.133
YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE,
YOU SHARE A HOUSE

21:21.167 --> 21:24.667
AND MAKE WISHES
ON EYELASHES WITH THEM.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.233
AND WE DON'T KNOW
EACH OTHER.

21:27.267 --> 21:28.767
NONE OF US.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.300
WE'RE JUST A BUNCH OF INTERNS
WHO WORK TOGETHER.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.800
THERE'S NOTHIN' THERE.

21:33.833 --> 21:35.833
(Preston)
THERE IS AN ARRHYTHMIA

21:35.867 --> 21:39.333
WHEN I PRESS DOWN
ON THE TUMOR.

21:39.367 --> 21:41.533
THAT IS A SIGN
OF WHAT, YANG?

21:41.567 --> 21:43.700
UM...

21:43.733 --> 21:46.133
UH, IT'S A SIGN OF--
IT'S A S--

21:46.167 --> 21:47.333
IT'S A SIGN

21:47.367 --> 21:50.600
THAT THE TUMOR HAS INFILTRATED
THE PERICARDIUM.

21:50.633 --> 21:52.267
POSSIBILITIES?

21:52.300 --> 21:55.067
I-I'M SORRY.
I...

21:55.100 --> 21:56.600
DO YOUR HOMEWORK, YANG.

21:56.633 --> 21:58.533
IT COULD BE CAUSING A TEAR

21:58.567 --> 22:01.400
IN THE OUTER MUSCLE
OF THE HEART.

22:01.433 --> 22:03.567
(Man) SO HE'S GOT
A BROKEN HEART?

22:05.567 --> 22:06.600
CRISTINA.

22:06.633 --> 22:08.467
CRISTINA.

22:08.500 --> 22:11.567
SOMEBODY HELP HER.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.600
***

22:17.767 --> 22:18.833
CRISTINA. CRISTINA.

22:18.867 --> 22:21.800
DON'T JUST STAND THERE,
DAMN IT. SOMEBODY HELP HER.

22:21.833 --> 22:23.467
GET A GURNEY IN HERE!
CRISTINA.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.367
(Miranda) WE GOT IT,
DR. BURKE. WE GOT IT.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.733
ALL RIGHT, TALK TO ME.
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

22:26.767 --> 22:29.233
WHAT DO WE KNOW?
TALK TO ME, STEVENS.
I DON'T KNOW.

22:29.267 --> 22:30.333
COME ON, PEOPLE,
LET'S MOVE.

22:30.367 --> 22:31.533
(Miranda)
CRISTINA, WHAT HURTS?

22:31.567 --> 22:34.133
LET'S GET HER OUTTA HERE.
THERE'S A PATIENT ON THE TABLE.

22:34.167 --> 22:36.200
LIFT.

22:36.233 --> 22:38.633
DR. BAILEY, WHEN YOU
GET HER STABILIZED,

22:38.667 --> 22:40.267
I NEED A REPORT, PLEASE.
DR. BAILEY!

22:40.300 --> 22:41.800
RIGHT, DR. BURKE.

22:44.633 --> 22:47.467
(Miranda)
HER PULSE IS RACING.

22:47.500 --> 22:50.300
I NEED HER ON A MONITOR,
NEED TO GET A B.P.

22:50.333 --> 22:52.533
ALSO, I WANT HER STARTED ON
AT LITER OF L.R. WIDE OPEN.
(Cristina) IZZIE.

22:52.567 --> 22:54.167
GET TO EMERGENCY. LET 'EM
KNOW WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.133
WHAT?
SEVEN WEEKS.
I'M PREGNANT, IZZIE.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.533
I'M PREGNANT.

22:59.767 --> 23:02.467
UH, OKAY, NO.
WE'RE GOING TO PRE-OP INSTEAD.

23:02.500 --> 23:05.267
FIND ADDISON SHEPHERD,
AND, IZZIE, BE DISCREET.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.833
SO I'M LEAVING
IN THE MORNING.

23:08.867 --> 23:10.367
NO.
EXCUSE ME?

23:10.400 --> 23:12.300
NO, I'M NOT ACCEPTING
YOUR RESIGNATION.

23:12.333 --> 23:13.367
IT'S NOT A RESIGNATION,
RICHARD.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.767
IT'S NOTIFICATION. I DON'T
OFFICIALLY WORK FOR YOU.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.700
I CAME HERE FOR ONE CASE.

23:18.733 --> 23:20.633
I CAN TRACK THE TWINS'
PROGRESS FROM NEW YORK.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.500
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE PREEMIE.

23:22.533 --> 23:25.300
I'M LETTING GO OF THE PREEMIE,
YOU KNOW THAT.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.667
HE CALLS ME SATAN,
RICHARD.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.300
YOU--YOU DON'T LIKE
TO HIDE FROM A FIGHT.

23:30.333 --> 23:32.800
NO FIGHT. HE WINS.
I'M LEAVING IN THE MORNING.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.400
WHAT IS IT, O'MALLEY?

23:36.433 --> 23:38.533
IT'S DR. GREY, SIR.
ELLIS.

23:38.567 --> 23:41.433
(George) C.T. CONFIRMED
DIVERTICULITIS,

23:41.467 --> 23:44.300
BUT A LIVER MASS
WAS ALSO FOUND.

23:44.333 --> 23:45.433
MY GOD.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.800
POOR MEREDITH.

23:46.833 --> 23:48.733
AS IF HER MOTHER HAVING
ALZHEIMER'S ISN'T BAD ENOUGH,

23:48.767 --> 23:50.667
NOW SHE HAS TO DEAL
WITH LIVER CANCER.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.600
YOU WON'T KNOW THAT
IT'S CANCER

23:52.633 --> 23:54.667
UNTIL YOU DO A BIOPSY,
O'MALLEY.
RIGHT. SORRY.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.700
EXCUSE ME, DR. SHEPHERD,
WE NEED YOU, FAST.

23:57.733 --> 24:00.800
UM, IT'S CRISTINA,
ONE OF OUR INTERNS.

24:00.833 --> 24:02.067
SHE'S...

24:02.100 --> 24:03.567
SHE'S COLLAPSED.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.600
CRISTINA'S COLLAPSED?

24:05.633 --> 24:07.533
WHY DO YOU NEED ME?

24:13.100 --> 24:14.700
CRISTINA'S PREGNANT?

24:14.733 --> 24:17.067
SHUT UP, GEORGE.
PLEASE COME.

24:17.067 --> 24:17.833
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING,
RICHARD.

24:17.867 --> 24:20.667
I'M STILL LEAVING
IN THE MORNING.

24:20.700 --> 24:23.767
THIS IS A VERY BAD DAY.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.067
OKAY, DR. KAREV, IF WE'RE
GONNA STOP HER BLUSHING,

24:26.067 --> 24:28.800
WE HAVE TO EXPOSE
THE SYMPATHETIC GANGLION CHAIN

24:28.833 --> 24:30.567
WHICH RESIDES WHERE?

24:30.600 --> 24:34.133
IT'S TIME TO CLEAR ME
FOR SURGERY, SHEPHERD.
WHAT?

24:34.167 --> 24:36.200
I KNOW YOU HEARD ME.
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

24:36.233 --> 24:38.433
CHIEF, I'M A LITTLE BUSY HERE.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

24:38.467 --> 24:40.767
JUST GIVE A VERBAL OKAY.
WE CAN DO THE PAPERWORK LATER.

24:40.800 --> 24:42.300
I CANNOT DO THAT.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.233
I AM YOUR CHIEF OF SURGERY.
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST.

24:44.267 --> 24:46.167
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,
IN THIS SITUATION,

24:46.200 --> 24:48.500
I'M NOT YOUR SUBORDINATE,
I'M YOUR DOCTOR.

24:48.533 --> 24:49.533
ONE WEEK
AFTER BRAIN SURGERY,

24:49.567 --> 24:51.467
YOU ARE NOT READY
TO RESUME MEDICAL PRACTICE.

24:51.500 --> 24:54.300
IT'S A SIMPLE PROCEDURE.
A NEEDLE BIOPSY.

24:54.333 --> 24:58.200
A RESIDENT COULD DO IT.
SO LET A RESIDENT DO IT.
WHAT AM I MISSING HERE?

24:58.233 --> 25:00.167
IT'S FOR MY MOTHER,

25:00.200 --> 25:01.667
ISN'T IT?

25:01.700 --> 25:03.367
YOU THINK SHE HAS CANCER.

25:05.067 --> 25:07.067
GEORGE NEEDS YOUR SIGNATURE.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.400
RICHARD, I KNOW
SHE'S YOUR FRIEND.

25:15.433 --> 25:18.300
I'M NOT CLEARING YOU
FOR SURGERY.

25:18.333 --> 25:20.500
WHAT'S HER TOTAL BILI?

25:20.533 --> 25:23.233
IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY 4.

25:23.267 --> 25:25.067
I MEAN, IT'S NOT GREAT,
BUT IT'S NOT TERRIBLE.

25:25.067 --> 25:26.800
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T SEE
THE JAUNDICE.

25:26.833 --> 25:28.133
NO ONE COULD.

25:28.167 --> 25:30.200
WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT
AND SEE.

25:30.233 --> 25:32.800
WHAT AREN'T YOU TELLING ME?

25:34.433 --> 25:35.667
IT'S CRISTINA.

25:38.567 --> 25:39.767
HAVE YOU NOTIFIED
THE FATHER?

25:39.800 --> 25:42.100
CRISTINA. CRISTINA.

25:42.133 --> 25:43.200
CRISTINA.

25:43.233 --> 25:45.200
CRISTINA, IS THERE ANYONE
WE CAN CALL?

25:48.200 --> 25:49.667
WE'RE LOSING HER.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.767
OH, MAN. YOU SEE THAT? IT WAS
AN EXTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY.

25:51.800 --> 25:54.067
THE TUBE BURST.
SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.

26:04.633 --> 26:05.800
AH, GOOD. YOU'RE FINISHED.

26:05.833 --> 26:07.733
I NEED YOU TO DO
A NEEDLE BIOPSY.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.667
UM, I'VE GOTTA GO
CHECK ON...

26:09.700 --> 26:11.600
THERE'S SOMEONE I NEED
TO SEE ABOUT.

26:11.633 --> 26:14.467
I HAD AN INTERN COLLAPSE ON ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF SURGERY.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.400
SO IF THIS COULD WAIT--

26:16.433 --> 26:18.333
NO, I NEED YOU TO DO
A NEEDLE BIOPSY NOW.

26:18.367 --> 26:20.067
CHIEF, NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

26:20.067 --> 26:23.200
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR A DEBATE. YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:23.233 --> 26:26.233
YOU'LL DO IT
BECAUSE I ASKED YOU TO.

26:26.267 --> 26:31.400
BECAUSE I NEED YOU TO.

26:33.567 --> 26:35.667
IT'S ELLIS GREY.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.133
***

26:51.167 --> 26:54.100
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY,
RIGHT?

26:54.133 --> 26:56.233
HOW ATTACHED WAS SHE
TO THIS PREGNANCY?

26:56.267 --> 26:57.600
I DON'T KNOW.

26:57.633 --> 27:00.567
SHE'S A PRETTY
PRIVATE PERSON.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.500
SHE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.333
BUT I'M IN CONTROL.

27:06.433 --> 27:08.100
DR. BAILEY, YOU MUST HAVE

27:08.133 --> 27:10.067
A SURGERY OR TWO
OF YOUR OWN TODAY.

27:10.067 --> 27:12.100
I'M FINE RIGHT HERE.

27:12.133 --> 27:15.133
***

27:24.567 --> 27:27.267
CAN YOU DO THE FOLLOW-UP?
I WANNA CHECK ON CRISTINA.

27:27.300 --> 27:28.700
(Alex) YEAH. YOU KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

27:28.733 --> 27:29.667
DON'T.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.200
I'M SORRY.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.433
DON'T BE SORRY.

27:32.467 --> 27:34.233
I'M SO TIRED
OF YOU BEING SORRY.

27:34.267 --> 27:36.133
DON'T DO IT.
DR. GREY--

27:36.167 --> 27:38.067
DR. GREY. SERIOUSLY?

27:38.067 --> 27:40.400
ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT
ALEX FINDING OUT ABOUT US?

27:40.433 --> 27:42.333
IS THAT WHAT MATTERS
TO YOU?

27:42.367 --> 27:44.433
DO YOU REALLY THINK
HE CARES?

27:44.467 --> 27:46.133
ALEX, DO YOU CARE THAT
I WAS THE INTERN

27:46.167 --> 27:48.533
STUPID ENOUGH TO SCREW
THE MARRIED ATTENDING?

27:48.567 --> 27:50.500
NO.

27:50.533 --> 27:52.767
MEREDITH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT OKAY.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.167
YOU HAVE A WIFE
WHO'S NOT EASY TO HATE,

27:56.200 --> 27:57.533
WHO'S ANNOYINGLY KIND

27:57.567 --> 27:59.800
AND PAINFULLY SMART

27:59.833 --> 28:01.467
AND CURRENTLY SAVING
MY FRIEND'S LIFE.

28:01.500 --> 28:03.700
WOULD YOU JUST--
DON'T.

28:03.733 --> 28:07.100
STOP TALKING TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND.

28:07.133 --> 28:10.067
STOP TALKING TO ME
AT ALL.

28:10.833 --> 28:14.667
DUDE...
THAT WAS ROUGH.

28:16.467 --> 28:19.633
***

28:26.133 --> 28:27.300
YOU NEED SOMETHING?

28:27.333 --> 28:28.667
I'M COMING IN.

28:28.700 --> 28:31.100
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
I AM. I'M HER FRIEND.

28:31.133 --> 28:32.233
EXACTLY.

28:32.267 --> 28:34.167
SHE'S LYING
ON THE OPERATING TABLE,

28:34.200 --> 28:35.500
NAKED, EXPOSED.

28:35.533 --> 28:38.233
SHE'S SEDATED, BUT SHE'S
PROBABLY SCARED OUT OF HER MIND.

28:38.267 --> 28:39.467
AND RIGHT NOW,
SHE'S NOT A DOCTOR,

28:39.500 --> 28:41.267
SHE'S NOT YOUR FRIEND,
SHE'S A PATIENT.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.633
AND SHE DESERVES TO HAVE
ALL THE PRIVACY I CAN GIVE HER.

28:43.667 --> 28:45.600
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN THERE.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.833
WE WENT JOGGING THIS MORNING.

28:50.867 --> 28:53.100
I MADE HER GO JOGGING.

28:53.133 --> 28:55.067
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT COULD'VE--

28:55.100 --> 28:57.667
NO, NO.
IT STARTED OUT THIS WAY.

28:57.700 --> 29:00.600
NOTHING CAUSED IT
TO HAPPEN.

29:00.633 --> 29:03.067
YOU HAVE TO LET ME
IN THERE.

29:04.633 --> 29:06.367
YOU CAN TRY.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.667
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE YOU DOWN.

29:07.700 --> 29:09.400
HEY...

29:09.433 --> 29:11.333
I MAY BE SHORT,
BUT YOU'RE PRETTY TINY.

29:11.367 --> 29:12.767
I COULD DO IT.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.133
RIGHT NOW,

29:14.167 --> 29:16.833
JUST IN THIS MOMENT,
I HATE YOU.

29:16.867 --> 29:18.633
YEAH, WELL...

29:18.667 --> 29:20.633
I CAN TAKE IT.

29:23.167 --> 29:24.467
ALL RIGHT, DR. GREY.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.400
WE'RE GOING TO PUT YOU
TO SLEEP FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

29:26.433 --> 29:27.800
BUT I PROMISE,

29:27.833 --> 29:30.267
WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK
INTO SURGERY IN NO TIME.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.633
RICHARD...

29:32.667 --> 29:36.400
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE...

29:36.433 --> 29:39.233
YOU BEAUTIFUL MAN.

29:39.267 --> 29:43.267
THAT HUSBAND OF MINE
HAS BEEN MAKING ME CRAZY.

29:43.300 --> 29:46.300
***

30:06.700 --> 30:10.200
(monitor beeping)

30:19.367 --> 30:21.167
LOOK AT THAT.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.200
B.P.'s STABILIZING.

30:23.233 --> 30:25.167
SHE'S STRONGER
SINCE THIS MORNING.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.100
THERE'S NO REASON
IN THE WORLD

30:27.133 --> 30:30.067
WHY SHE SHOULD BE STRONGER
SINCE THIS MORNING.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.600
SHE'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL,

30:33.633 --> 30:34.700
ISN'T SHE?

30:34.733 --> 30:37.300
TELL YOU WHAT.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.233
IF SHE MAKES IT
THOUGH THE NIGHT

30:39.267 --> 30:41.633
AND SHE HAS
A LITTLE BIT MORE STRENGTH,

30:41.667 --> 30:43.300
I'LL OPERATE.

30:43.333 --> 30:45.467
***

30:45.500 --> 30:48.533
YOU KNOW...

30:48.567 --> 30:52.567
THE WAY I SEE IT,
WE COULD DEAL WITH US

30:52.600 --> 30:55.267
IN ONE OF THREE WAYS.

30:55.300 --> 30:59.333
OPTION ONE, I COULD APOLOGIZE,
YOU COULD FORGIVE ME

30:59.367 --> 31:00.467
AND COME HOME

31:00.500 --> 31:04.667
AND WE COULD MOVE ON
WITH OUR LIVES LIKE ADULTS.

31:04.700 --> 31:08.300
OR OPTION TWO,

31:08.333 --> 31:11.200
I COULD APOLOGIZE, YOU COULD
FORGIVE ME, COME HOME,

31:11.233 --> 31:13.467
BUT YOU COULD STILL BRING IT UP
TO USE AGAINST ME

31:13.500 --> 31:14.833
WHENEVER WE ARGUE.

31:14.867 --> 31:16.667
ARE YOU TRYING
TO BE FUNNY?

31:16.700 --> 31:19.067
SATAN HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR.

31:19.067 --> 31:22.167
WHAT'S THE THIRD?

31:22.200 --> 31:25.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE THIRD OPTION IS.

31:35.533 --> 31:38.267
I JUST KNOW
I STILL LOVE YOU.

31:38.300 --> 31:41.300
***

31:46.833 --> 31:49.700
TELL THEM THE CHIEF SAID
TO PUT A RUSH ON THIS BIOPSY

31:49.733 --> 31:51.633
AND TELL THEM
IT'S ELLIS GREY.

31:51.667 --> 31:52.600
OKAY.

31:52.633 --> 31:54.533
OH, DR. BURKE, DO YOU WANT
THE HISTOLOGIC GRADE

31:54.567 --> 31:56.467
AND STAGING
OR ANY SPECIFIC STAINS?

31:56.500 --> 31:58.500
HAVE THEM RUN
ALL TESTS.
OKAY.

32:05.367 --> 32:08.367
***

32:27.867 --> 32:30.633
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:30.667 --> 32:33.667
YOU HAD
AN EXTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY.

32:33.700 --> 32:38.067
YOUR LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE
BURST.

32:38.067 --> 32:40.500
DR. SHEPHERD...

32:40.533 --> 32:43.267
SHE DID EVERYTHING
SHE COULD,

32:43.300 --> 32:45.467
BUT THERE WAS
TOO MUCH DAMAGE.

32:45.500 --> 32:48.433
SHE COULDN'T SAVE THE TUBE.

33:00.467 --> 33:01.567
HEY.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.433
HEY.

33:03.467 --> 33:04.667
IS IT OVER?

33:04.700 --> 33:07.333
MM-HMM.
THE SURGERY WAS SUCCESSFUL.

33:07.367 --> 33:09.267
WE'RE JUST DOING
A FOLLOW-UP.

33:09.300 --> 33:12.833
DR. SHEPHERD WILL BE IN
TO CHECK ON YOU IN AWHILE.

33:12.867 --> 33:15.067
SAY THAT AGAIN.

33:15.067 --> 33:16.400
WHAT?

33:16.433 --> 33:19.833
SAY HIS NAME--
DR. SHEPHER--

33:19.867 --> 33:24.067
OH, MY GOD,
LOOK AT MY FACE.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.433
DR. SHEPHERD.

33:28.467 --> 33:30.467
DR. SHEPHERD.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.333
GUESS IT WAS WORTH
THE RISK.

33:38.267 --> 33:40.433
I STILL THINK IT'S NUTS--
HAVING MAJOR SURGERY

33:40.467 --> 33:43.833
JUST SO PEOPLE CAN'T TELL
HOW YOU'RE FEELIN'.

33:43.867 --> 33:46.067
REALLY? YOU DO?

33:46.100 --> 33:48.233
NAH, I GUESS NOT.

33:49.767 --> 33:52.733
YOU COULD TALK, YOU KNOW.
I MEAN, IF YOU NEED TO.

33:52.767 --> 33:53.833
I'M FINE.

33:53.867 --> 33:55.633
YOU'VE SAID THAT WORD
SO MANY TIMES TODAY,

33:55.667 --> 33:57.400
IT DOESN'T EVEN SOUND
LIKE A WORD ANYMORE.

33:57.433 --> 33:59.500
I'M JUST SAYIN'
YOU COULD TALK TO ME

33:59.533 --> 34:02.100
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, EVEN IF
I REPEAT EVERY WORD YOU SAY,

34:02.133 --> 34:04.333
NO ONE AROUND HERE LIKES ME.
THEY'LL JUST CALL ME A LIAR

34:04.367 --> 34:06.800
AND MOVE ON.
IZZIE LIKES YOU.

34:07.767 --> 34:09.133
YOU'RE BLUSHING.

34:09.167 --> 34:11.500
SHUT UP.

34:11.533 --> 34:13.067
LOOK, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

34:13.067 --> 34:15.500
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU'RE STILL ON YOUR FEET.

34:15.533 --> 34:18.267
I MEAN, IF I FOUND OUT
MY MOM MIGHT HAVE CANCER,

34:18.300 --> 34:19.833
I'D BE UNDER THE BAR
BY NOW.

34:19.867 --> 34:22.433
YOU WANT THE UGLY TRUTH?

34:22.467 --> 34:24.133
YOU HAVE AN UGLY TRUTH?

34:24.167 --> 34:27.367
I NEVER WOULDA PEGGED YOU
TO HAVE AN UGLY TRUTH.

34:27.400 --> 34:30.067
I'M MORE AFRAID
SHE DOESN'T HAVE CANCER.

34:30.100 --> 34:32.600
WELL, LIVER CANCER'S FAST.

34:32.633 --> 34:35.567
PAINFUL, BUT IT'S FAST,
AND THEY GIVE YOU MORPHINE.

34:35.600 --> 34:38.167
THEY DON'T GIVE YOU MORPHINE
FOR ALZHEIMER'S.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.767
NO, THEY DON'T.

34:42.300 --> 34:46.700
WHAT KIND OF PERSON WISHES
THEIR MOTHER HAD CANCER?

34:51.067 --> 34:52.367
(sighs)

34:52.400 --> 34:54.567
IT'S HARD.

34:57.233 --> 35:01.067
I KNOW IT'S HARD
BEING THE ONE WHO'S GONE.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.667
BUT, MAN...

35:06.700 --> 35:10.400
IT ISN'T EASY BEIN'
THE ONE WHO'S STILL AROUND.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.700
HEY, DID YOU GET YOUR MOM'S
BIOPSY RESULTS BACK YET?

35:20.733 --> 35:22.100
NOT YET.

35:22.133 --> 35:23.600
HOW'S CRISTINA?

35:23.633 --> 35:24.833
SHE'S, UH...

35:24.867 --> 35:27.733
SHE'S GONNA HAVE
A LOT OF PAIN FOR A FEW DAYS,

35:27.767 --> 35:30.333
BUT SHE'LL BE OKAY.

35:30.367 --> 35:32.300
I'M GLAD YOU WERE THERE.

35:32.333 --> 35:34.533
ARE YOU?

35:34.567 --> 35:37.067
YES, I AM.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.400
IT'S JUST...

35:39.433 --> 35:41.333
IT'S JUST THAT
A LOT OF THE TIME,

35:41.367 --> 35:43.267
IT FEELS LIKE
YOU AND CRISTINA

35:43.300 --> 35:44.633
ARE KINDA OVER THERE,

35:44.667 --> 35:46.767
AND I'M HERE.

35:50.400 --> 35:52.100
SO ABOUT ALEX...

35:52.133 --> 35:54.067
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
YOU GUYS HATE HIM. FINE.

35:54.067 --> 35:55.633
(groans)

35:55.667 --> 35:57.400
YEAH, WE DO.

35:57.433 --> 36:01.233
BUT I JUST WANNA SAY
THAT I BELIEVE YOU,

36:01.267 --> 36:03.167
THAT HE'S DIFFERENT
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.400
(Man) HERE YOU GO.

36:05.433 --> 36:07.067
ELLIS GREY.

36:20.267 --> 36:22.667
LET HER KNOW.

36:22.700 --> 36:24.533
MEREDITH, ARE YOU OKAY?

36:24.567 --> 36:26.067
NO.

36:26.100 --> 36:29.100
I'M NOT OKAY.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.567
DR. GREY.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.500
OH, PLEASE, THATCHER.
I'VE HAD A LONG DAY.

36:37.533 --> 36:39.200
I'M TIRED. GO AWAY.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.300
NO.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.633
WHAT?
NO.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.133
I AM THATCHER GREY.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.633
AND I'M YOUR HUSBAND,
AND, UH,

36:55.667 --> 36:57.567
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE ME
VERY MUCH,

36:57.600 --> 36:59.667
BUT THE FACT IS,

36:59.700 --> 37:02.667
I DON'T ALWAYS LIKE YOU
VERY MUCH EITHER.

37:02.700 --> 37:06.367
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU SPEAK TO ME.

37:06.400 --> 37:11.100
AND I REALLY HATE
THE WAY YOU SPEAK TO MEREDITH.

37:11.133 --> 37:13.667
SHE DESERVES BETTER
FROM YOU.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.467
I'M SORRY.

37:20.300 --> 37:21.567
YOU ARE?

37:21.600 --> 37:24.533
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME,
THATCH?

37:24.567 --> 37:26.367
UH...

37:26.400 --> 37:27.833
THE MASS ON YOUR LIVER--

37:27.867 --> 37:30.333
IS IT ALGEBRA?

37:30.367 --> 37:32.400
I MEAN,

37:32.433 --> 37:35.300
IS IT ALGEB--
DAMN IT.

37:39.233 --> 37:41.733
IS IT MALIGNANT?

37:41.767 --> 37:44.267
NO.

37:44.300 --> 37:46.700
IT'S BENIGN.

37:48.567 --> 37:51.567
***

37:55.800 --> 37:57.700
MEREDITH.

38:01.133 --> 38:02.067
MEREDITH.

38:02.100 --> 38:05.433
DON'T.

38:05.467 --> 38:10.500
PLEASE, PLEASE,
JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

38:10.533 --> 38:12.233
OKAY.

38:24.133 --> 38:26.500
I'M JUST EXHAUSTED.

38:26.533 --> 38:29.367
MY MOTHER IS EXHAUSTING,

38:29.400 --> 38:32.133
WHAT HAPPENED TO CRISTINA...

38:32.167 --> 38:34.567
AND YOU...

38:34.600 --> 38:38.433
HATING YOU IS
THE MOST EXHAUSTING.

38:38.467 --> 38:41.467
***

38:43.867 --> 38:47.400
I DON'T WANNA DO IT
ANYMORE.

38:49.600 --> 38:52.733
NO ONE
LIKES TO LOOSE CONTROL,

38:52.767 --> 38:55.467
BUT AS A SURGEON...

38:57.167 --> 38:59.233
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE.

38:59.267 --> 39:02.267
***

39:08.733 --> 39:12.400
IT'S A SIGN OF WEAKNESS...

39:12.433 --> 39:15.533
OF NOT BEING UP TO THE TASK.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.400
HOW CAN SOMEONE BE
SO OFFENSIVE

39:20.433 --> 39:22.333
AND YET SO CHARMING
ALL AT THE SAME TIME?

39:22.367 --> 39:23.700
IT'S AN ART FORM.

39:23.733 --> 39:25.300
MM-HMM.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.700
AND STILL, THERE ARE TIMES

39:29.733 --> 39:33.567
WHEN IT JUST GETS AWAY
FROM YOU...

39:33.600 --> 39:36.133
WHEN THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING

39:36.167 --> 39:38.467
AND YOU REALIZE THAT
YOUR SHINY LITTLE SCALPEL

39:38.500 --> 39:41.433
ISN'T GONNA SAVE YOU...

39:42.767 --> 39:45.633
WE WENT IN EXPECTING
TO SIMPLY REMOVE THE TUMOR.

39:45.667 --> 39:49.067
INSTEAD, IT WAS
A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.

39:49.100 --> 39:51.567
THE TUMOR INFILTRATED
INTO THE PERICARDIUM,

39:51.600 --> 39:53.100
CAUSING A TEAR

39:53.133 --> 39:55.300
IN THE OUTER MUSCLE
OF THE HEART.

39:55.333 --> 39:57.233
UM...

39:57.267 --> 40:00.267
THAT'S A LOT
OF MEDICAL TALK.

40:00.300 --> 40:03.600
IT MEANS, UH, AHEM...

40:04.767 --> 40:07.233
IT MEANS...

40:07.267 --> 40:08.667
THAT YOU HAD--

40:08.700 --> 40:10.700
YOU HAD A BROKEN HEART,
LITERALLY.

40:12.633 --> 40:15.133
UM...

40:15.167 --> 40:17.700
BUT NOW I'M, UM...

40:17.733 --> 40:21.567
BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO BE FINE.

40:27.067 --> 40:32.033
AND NO MATTER HOW HARD
YOU FIGHT IT, YOU FALL.

40:32.067 --> 40:34.533
AND IT'S SCARY AS HELL.

40:37.733 --> 40:41.500
EXCEPT, IF THERE'S
AN UPSIDE TO FREE-FALLING,

40:41.533 --> 40:44.733
IT'S THE CHANCE YOU GIVE
YOUR FRIENDS TO CATCH YOU.
