00:15.749 --> 00:16.917
Previously on Blunt Talk...

00:17.017 --> 00:18.652
Happy three-month
anniversary, Mommy.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.689
- Do you call him Daddy?
- No, but I'd like to.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.191
You're wasting your time, okay?
I'm just the middleman

00:23.291 --> 00:25.059
for the middleman
for the middleman
for the middleman.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.195
Don't you make me
find out if this gun
is loaded.

00:27.295 --> 00:29.563
Who is behind
this propaganda?

00:29.663 --> 00:32.666
Corporations who invested
in overpriced technology

00:32.766 --> 00:34.202
like desalinization.

00:34.302 --> 00:38.672
I want to get hold
of the elusive CEO

00:38.772 --> 00:41.309
of this company,
Daniel Rudolph.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.478
Harry and Rafe and I
have been arrested

00:44.578 --> 00:45.946
for the murder of Arbogast.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.815
- Did you do it?
- No, of course not!

00:47.915 --> 00:51.119
So what happened?
You crossed Rudolph Global
and they framed you?

00:51.219 --> 00:53.954
Exactly.
Until all the charges
are dropped,

00:54.054 --> 00:56.390
you are suspended.
No!

01:15.209 --> 01:17.578
Have you spotted
any dolphins, sea lions,

01:17.678 --> 01:21.249
whales, condors, sharks
or elephant seals, Major?

01:21.349 --> 01:24.318
We're not here
for sightseeing, Harry.

01:24.418 --> 01:27.855
I estimate about
500 yards north of here

01:27.955 --> 01:32.526
is where the Rudolphs'
desalinization plant
could be situated.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.531
Can you let the quest go
for just one minute, sir?

01:37.631 --> 01:40.368
I thought we were
also here to get away.

01:40.468 --> 01:43.304
There is no
getting away, Harry.
There's no escape.

01:43.404 --> 01:47.241
There are only four more
days until the vote
on Proposition 68.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.545
You know, Major,
if you hadn't
seen Cornelia

01:51.645 --> 01:54.047
through that
bus window, none of this
would have happened.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.184
You would still
have Blunt Talk.

01:56.250 --> 02:00.020
Love destroys, Harry.
We both know that now.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.523
Yes, Major.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.725
I'd still like
to see a dolphin.

02:04.825 --> 02:07.195
Hmm.
Or an elephant seal.

02:07.261 --> 02:10.664
It's always been a goal
of mine to see an elephant
seal make love.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.636
Well, it-- it's good
to have goals, Harry.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.816
Oh, check it now.
Check it now.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.751
What's it say?
What's it say?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.753
It's a smiley face.
Okay.

02:32.853 --> 02:33.954
Definitely a smiley face.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.790
Um... I'm pregnant.

02:40.228 --> 02:43.096
Martin! Oh.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.499
Come on.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.239
Are you all right,
my love?

02:51.305 --> 02:53.574
My stars, my moon,
my cock, my man.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.245
What happened?
You fainted because
I'm pregnant.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.812
Oh.
What are you thinking?

02:58.912 --> 03:01.282
I'm thinking
that my parents
are gonna kill me

03:01.382 --> 03:03.917
and that I still haven't
paid off my student loans.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.719
Wh-- what are
you thinking?

03:05.819 --> 03:09.490
I'm thinking we're going
to have a beautiful baby.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.034
Jim, darling, wake up.
Time for work.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.337
Wake up, Jim.

03:24.672 --> 03:27.875
Oh. Morning, Mommy.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.644
Morning, Daddy.

03:30.744 --> 03:34.415
Someday I'm going
to put a ring on one
of these toes.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.818
Jim, remember,
we said baby steps.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.687
Yeah, I know.
I was just joking.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.789
I learned something
from my colonoscopy.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.802
God, that was good.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.370
Pure bliss.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.439
What did
Jules Verne say?

03:58.539 --> 04:01.342
"The sea is infinite,
the sea is love."

04:01.442 --> 04:04.612
Yeah, well, if Daniel
Rudolph has his way,

04:04.712 --> 04:06.880
all this
will cease to exist.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.884
You have a tendency
to cast a dark shadow
over things, Major.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.354
Yes, I know, Harry.
It's one of my strengths.

04:13.454 --> 04:17.325
Well, we should
break camp.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.394
My meeting with Gardner
is in two hours.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.165
Major...

04:25.333 --> 04:27.335
whenever I went
to the sea with my mother,

04:27.435 --> 04:29.903
I always asked if I could
have one more swim,

04:30.003 --> 04:31.539
one more frolic.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.741
And she would always say,
"No, Harry.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.510
You've had enough
happiness for one day."

04:37.811 --> 04:39.480
So...

04:41.849 --> 04:43.617
Yes, of course, Harry.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.553
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

05:01.969 --> 05:05.439
I am sorry, Walter,
but I cannot lift
your suspension.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.475
Also, Shelly
is doing great.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.744
She's got beautiful,
sexy numbers.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.382
All the charges are going
to be dropped, Bob.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.750
My new lawyer got hold
of the autopsy report.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.387
It was impossible for us
to have killed Arbogast.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.589
The major was on-air
at the time of death.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.958
That is a good alibi,
but you're still toxic
as hell.

05:25.058 --> 05:27.395
Have you seen
today's paper?

05:27.461 --> 05:30.498
- You've been drought-shamed.
- What?

05:31.865 --> 05:33.801
Damn it!
Harry.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.769
Well, I bought cacti

05:35.869 --> 05:38.739
and other indigenous flora
just as we discussed.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.575
They also say
you employ an illegal
alien as an unpaid slave.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.812
That is not true.
The major gives me
a very nice allowance.

05:44.912 --> 05:47.415
Each week he pays me--
Ah!

05:47.481 --> 05:49.683
That's private, Harry.
Yes, Major.

05:49.783 --> 05:53.320
Bob, Proposition 68
is coming up.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.424
Please let me
on the air.

05:56.524 --> 05:58.992
We need to do this
for Los Angeles!

05:59.092 --> 06:01.595
If it were up to me,
I would put you back on.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.532
But Bronson ripped into me
when I was in New York.

06:04.632 --> 06:07.034
He was ready to fire me
because of you.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.972
So Bob has
to look after Bob.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.507
I'm sorry.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.443
I understand.

06:15.509 --> 06:18.779
But Walter has to look
after Walter.

06:22.683 --> 06:26.119
Now, I don't want to be mean,
but none of this is working.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.489
Okay? I need
a Tinkle brand story.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.991
Something horrific
or feminist.

06:31.091 --> 06:34.294
Or horrific and feminist.
I know you can do it.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.763
Hey, look.
What about this?

06:35.863 --> 06:37.831
Clowns all across Europe
have been committing suicide.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.833
The Lancet
did a study on it.
Really?

06:39.933 --> 06:42.503
Yes, and they're
comparing it to birds
falling out of the sky.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.472
"A portent of a dark time."

06:44.538 --> 06:47.174
Do the clowns kill
themselves in costume

06:47.274 --> 06:49.877
or in their street clothes?
That's what I was wondering.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.045
I'm not sure.
Either way,
it's a great story.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.483
And the feminist angle
can be why are there
so few women clowns?

06:55.549 --> 06:58.318
Sorry I'm late.
Martin, darling.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.987
Why are you wearing
sunglasses?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.755
Because I've been
crying all morning.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.558
Oh, why?

07:04.658 --> 07:08.061
I can't say.
I'm trying to be stoic.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.963
Tsk, oh.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.872
Thank you.
Oh.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.342
Champagne, Mr. Blunt?

07:22.510 --> 07:24.645
I'll attend to the major,
thank you.

07:27.014 --> 07:30.183
All right, Bronson's
secretary got back to me.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.952
He will meet us
late tonight.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.722
Well done, sir.
Oh, thank you, Harry.

07:34.822 --> 07:38.191
And I had an email from Rafe
from the jail library.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.995
He and Duncan Adler
have started a recycling
initiative.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.864
Oh, sounds positive.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.600
And they're doing
"Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf"

07:46.700 --> 07:49.069
and Rafe is playing
the alcoholic wife.

07:49.169 --> 07:50.571
Naturally, sir.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.440
Oh, dear.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.744
I hate flying.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.380
What are you writing?

08:00.548 --> 08:03.984
A story on black
market lingerie sales
in Saudi Arabia.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.987
Under their burkas,
there's a revolution
going on.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.656
Oh, excellent.
Yeah.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.624
Shelly will love that.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.760
Very on brand.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.963
Tsk.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.965
Wh-- what's the matter,
Rosalie?

08:18.065 --> 08:19.567
I'm missing Teddy.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.902
And I'm worried
about Martin.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.705
Have you spoken to him?
Do you know anything?

08:24.805 --> 08:27.240
No, he's been
crying all day.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.277
Oh.
But it's too soon
for his male period.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.112
Are you sure?

08:32.212 --> 08:34.748
Oh, yeah,
because I'm a week
ahead of him

08:34.848 --> 08:36.684
and my breasts
are killing me.

08:36.784 --> 08:39.587
Well, see if you can
talk to him, then.

08:39.653 --> 08:42.690
Give him counsel.
He looks up to you, Jim.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.458
Yeah, I know.

08:45.593 --> 08:48.796
I'll work some
of my big brother magic.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.698
Oh, my God, Martin!

08:50.798 --> 08:54.101
You're way too young.
You're still a child yourself.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.638
I know.
I only started puberty
13 years ago.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.607
This March
is the anniversary.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.610
I'm not ready
to be a father.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.812
Are you sure
that it's yours?

09:04.912 --> 09:06.714
Aren't you guys in
an open relationship?

09:06.814 --> 09:09.683
Yeah, but we've only
been open for a few days.

09:09.783 --> 09:12.019
Rosalie's only other
partner has been Rosalie.

09:12.119 --> 09:15.488
Yeah, it's unlikely
Rosalie knocked up Rosalie.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.825
Of course
it's unlikely, Jim.

09:17.925 --> 09:22.195
Well, you need to find out
if she's been with anyone
else just to be sure.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.232
Yeah, but she's only
ever been with three
other guys her whole life

09:25.332 --> 09:28.301
and one of them
had a micro penis.
That doesn't matter.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.971
If they hooked up
recently he could still
get her pregnant.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.141
The micro penis gene
has to get passed
on somehow.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.947
This has not been a very
helpful conversation, Jim.

09:41.849 --> 09:44.818
Oh, please don't tell anyone
what's going on, okay?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.754
I need to take care
of this on my own

09:46.854 --> 09:48.922
like a rugged individual.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.091
Like Teddy Roosevelt.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.225
Can I tell Celia?

09:52.325 --> 09:55.929
No, not telling anyone
means not telling Celia.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.765
Okay?

09:57.865 --> 10:00.133
Wait, is that thing on?

10:00.233 --> 10:02.602
No.
Okay.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.108
Celia, are you there?

10:08.208 --> 10:09.643
Fuck.

10:09.743 --> 10:14.581
Up next, what do women
wear under their burkas
in Saudi Arabia?

10:14.782 --> 10:18.786
Ooh, I'd like to know.
Back after this.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.722
Oh, isn't she fantastic?

10:21.822 --> 10:23.657
Oh, I mean, I know
we miss Walter,

10:23.757 --> 10:27.661
but a performance like that
makes me feel good about
being alive.

10:27.761 --> 10:30.097
Tinkle, Tinkle,
little star.
Yes, Bob.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.165
Oh, and you, you are
doing a great job

10:32.265 --> 10:33.734
of keeping
this team together.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.069
Mwah. Oh!

10:38.038 --> 10:40.073
Did Martin say
what's going on?

10:40.173 --> 10:43.110
No, he's trying to be
like Teddy Roosevelt.

10:43.210 --> 10:47.681
Damn it!
I knew I shouldn't have
given him that biography.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.150
Shelly's all set.
Holy shit.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.920
Is this what you want
for your children?

10:53.020 --> 10:55.155
Water from
your neighbor's toilet?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.024
Vote against
Proposition 68.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.359
Rudolph Global bought
ad time on Blunt Talk?

10:59.459 --> 11:03.396
Walter's gonna hate this,
but this ad makes me scared
of recycled water.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.034
Maybe that's why
that hydrologist had
that huge herpes blister.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.802
Oh, don't say that.
I slept with him.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.537
What? Celia!

11:10.771 --> 11:12.205
I'm joking.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.948
You know, Shelly,
you have got what it takes.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.750
You've got
that special quality.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.217
You really think so?
Oh, yeah.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.287
It's a narcissism
that all the great
anchors have.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.023
It comes off of you
in waves just like Walter.

11:30.123 --> 11:33.761
I'm so flattered you feel
this way, Mr. Gardner.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.081
No, don't get up,
please.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.951
Very nice to see you
again, Walter.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.620
Your color
is very good.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.790
Healthy, vital,
blooming.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.591
Moist.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.293
Yes.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.229
Well, thank you for seeing me
at this late hour.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.998
I only requested
this meeting

12:11.098 --> 12:13.133
because of the urgency
of what's at stake.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.036
Hmm, how are you
feeling?

12:16.136 --> 12:17.971
I know you've
been through a lot.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.640
Are you sane
or insane?

12:20.808 --> 12:22.175
I'm sane, of course.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.980
Do you ever look
at your body, Mr. Blunt?

12:27.080 --> 12:31.184
This strange glove
that houses your spirit.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.486
Just today I was looking
down at my legs

12:33.586 --> 12:36.423
and I thought to myself
why are we clocks

12:36.523 --> 12:37.925
that have to stop running?

12:38.025 --> 12:41.294
Are you wondering if
I contemplate my mortality?

12:41.394 --> 12:43.831
Yes.
Of course I do.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.666
Good.
I was just checking.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.236
I like to know
how my employees
are doing.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.472
Mr. Bronson, I'd like
to cut to the chase.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.842
I want to be reinstated--
Quiet!

12:54.908 --> 12:58.611
You live in a dream, Blunt.
You don't know who you are.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.513
Your face is a mask.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.150
No one knows you.
You don't know yourself.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.385
I take offense
at everything
you're saying.

13:05.485 --> 13:09.389
You see your life
in romantic terms,
but it's a fantasy.

13:09.489 --> 13:10.991
You feed your mind
with lies.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.226
Why are you speaking
to me in this way?

13:13.326 --> 13:15.462
Because I'm trying
to help you.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.231
What do you think you're doing
with the broadcast I gave you?

13:18.331 --> 13:20.067
I do what I think
is right.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.136
Rudolph Global
is a dangerous corporation.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.205
They need to be exposed.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.774
I happen to care about
Rudolph Global, Mr. Blunt.

13:27.875 --> 13:32.279
I also cared about Exxon Mobil
and Samsung and Pfizer

13:32.379 --> 13:35.748
and the American Joe
with his erectile dysfunction

13:35.949 --> 13:37.717
and chronic psoriasis

13:37.885 --> 13:41.188
who's buying the pills
and the creams

13:41.288 --> 13:44.391
that play
between your A block
and your B block

13:44.491 --> 13:46.559
and between your B block
and your C block

13:46.659 --> 13:48.896
and between your C block
and your D block.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.398
You're a shill
for a corrupt machine,
Blunt.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.334
So how can you possibly say
you do what is right

13:54.434 --> 13:58.138
when you're part
of everything that's wrong?

13:58.238 --> 14:01.008
Thank you for coming
to see me.

14:07.915 --> 14:11.384
Um, Celia,
there's something
I have to tell you.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.621
Oh, no, what now?
Evelyn texted me.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.991
That's no big deal.
Just tell her you're not
a prostitute anymore.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.928
But she wants me
to escort her tomorrow night

14:20.994 --> 14:24.965
to another fundraiser
for Sandler and it's at
Daniel Rudolph's house.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.167
So Rudolph will be there?
Yeah.

14:27.267 --> 14:29.769
Yeah, it's--
it's a surrealist ball

14:29.937 --> 14:32.272
like the one
the Rothschilds
threw in '72.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.941
Yeah, I've seen pictures
of that party.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.275
Audrey Hepburn
wore a birdcage.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.946
Anyway, I think I should go
and somehow bring Walter.

14:39.012 --> 14:41.381
Oh, God, I love this.
Wh-why can't we all go?

14:41.481 --> 14:44.551
Well, we could,
but we'd have to go
with Evelyn.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.988
That's okay as long
as I get half of whatever
she pays you.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.596
Oh, I really
like you, Shelly,

14:56.696 --> 14:58.331
and I'm not just
speaking professionally.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.133
Oh, I feel the same way.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.102
I've never experienced
chemistry like this.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.471
Me either.
What do you think?

15:04.571 --> 15:07.374
Huh? You want to do it
right here on Walter's desk?

15:07.474 --> 15:09.542
Oh, naughty.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.811
But, gee, Bob,
I don't know.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.014
What about his couch?
Would that be okay?

15:14.114 --> 15:16.549
Sure, I guess we don't want
to be too disrespectful.
No.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.221
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.223
If we're gonna make love,

15:23.323 --> 15:24.992
there's something
you should know.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.560
What, you have cancer?
No.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.665
Show it to me.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.143
Fuck. Shit.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.784
That's my ass pad.

15:52.019 --> 15:55.022
You know, showbiz.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.256
Do you still like me?

15:56.356 --> 15:58.325
Of course.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.193
My boyfriend wears
the same thing.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.529
That's hot.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.031
Mm. Oh!

16:04.064 --> 16:05.532
My name is Gregory Arkadin!

16:05.632 --> 16:07.667
I will pay anything.
I'll give you a check now.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.502
I must have a seat
on that plane.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.438
I must have a seat
on that plane.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.440
Seat on that plane.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.908
Major, are you all right?

16:16.109 --> 16:18.911
Just a bad dream, Harry.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.480
About Bronson, sir?

16:20.580 --> 16:23.150
No, another Orson Welles.
Oh.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.387
Fuck that madman Bronson.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.589
I am not gonna quit, Harry.

16:29.689 --> 16:33.226
We'll find a way, sir.
You're better than
Rudolph Global.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.529
Folks, we're gonna be
having some mild turbulence.

16:36.629 --> 16:40.700
Nothing too bad,
but go ahead and return
to your seats and buckle up.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.071
We're all going to die!

16:46.473 --> 16:49.609
So, the Rudolphs
fancy themselves

16:49.709 --> 16:52.112
as latter-day
Rothschilds.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.980
Such ego.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.915
Jim's friend got us
tickets to the party.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.350
It starts at midnight
and goes to noon.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.685
It's supposed
to be surreal time.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.087
And costumes
are mandatory.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.089
And if we can get you
alone with Rudolph,

17:02.189 --> 17:04.657
maybe you could
get him talking
and secretly tape him

17:04.757 --> 17:06.359
like old-school
Mike Wallace.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.561
Oh, I like that.
Yeah.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.664
But what would we wear
to a surrealist party?

17:11.764 --> 17:13.933
I mean,
how would I blend in?

17:14.101 --> 17:18.805
Um, w-we could disguise
ourselves as women, Major.

17:18.905 --> 17:22.309
I've always wanted
to cross-dress ever since
I was a boy.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.977
Good thinking, Harry.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.813
How are my girls doing?

17:26.913 --> 17:31.017
Oh, look at you two.
I already got a hard-on.

17:31.118 --> 17:34.421
Save it for me, sweetie.
Oh, I always do, Stanley.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.557
Ronnie, is this
the right shade?

17:53.206 --> 17:55.775
I still
can't believe we both
came as Audrey Hepburn.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.611
I guess we just have
the same taste in
a lot of things--

17:58.711 --> 18:01.748
dresses,
birdcages, hunks.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.551
Um, our friends
are pulling up.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.572
Um, Evelyn,

18:25.672 --> 18:28.007
these ladies
are our plus two.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.042
I'm Harriet
and this is Winnie.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.245
We're third cousins.
Best friends.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.447
I love both your dresses.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.882
Thank you.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.917
Shall we?

18:38.185 --> 18:39.886
Sorry.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.462
Is the camera set?

18:49.562 --> 18:52.365
Oh, yes.
It's affixed to my bosom.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.201
Great.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.773
Don't be rude.

19:15.488 --> 19:19.125
What a beautiful
gem-encrusted music box.

19:19.226 --> 19:22.695
How long have you known
Daniel Rudolph?

19:22.795 --> 19:25.398
I've been coming
to his parties for years,

19:25.498 --> 19:28.235
but we've never
actually met.

19:28.301 --> 19:32.805
He's always in a private orgy
room with the A-list people.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.674
I see.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.443
I'm not A-list,
I'm afraid.

19:36.543 --> 19:39.579
I'm D-list,
but I have a good time.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.281
Oh, champagne!

19:41.381 --> 19:42.682
Let's split up.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.084
If you find Daniel Rudolph
in his private room

19:45.252 --> 19:47.354
before we do,
you come and find us.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.322
Copy that.
Okay.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.694
It's nice not to be
wearing pants for once,

19:54.794 --> 19:56.896
don't you think, Major?
Yes, Harry.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.700
I'm loving the sensation
of air between my thighs.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.770
Wearing a dress,
it's arousing to realize

20:03.870 --> 20:05.938
how easily our legs
could be parted

20:06.038 --> 20:08.341
to get at our private
female jewel.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.678
Harry, you don't have
a private female jewel.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.880
Please keep your mind
on the mission.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.683
We need to avoid Margaret
and find Daniel.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.385
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.321
Good.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.927
Holy shit.
Do these toilets work?

20:28.027 --> 20:30.463
Oh, God, no.
I made that mistake
last year.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.931
Oh, that's disgusting.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.933
So do they serve food
in the bathroom?

20:34.033 --> 20:36.769
Yes. I'm going
to the loo now.
I'm hungry.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.538
Come with me,
sweetheart.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.020
Harry,
let's check in here.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.488
Yes, sir.

21:08.635 --> 21:09.969
That was odd.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.075
Harry, I think
I've been spotted.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.911
Let's get out of here.
Find her bloody brother.
Yes, sir.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.793
Oh, goody.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.728
Sweets.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.603
Oh, yeah.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.506
Uh-uh, that's for
display only.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.441
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.743
That's all right,
just don't do it again.

22:23.843 --> 22:28.415
Pardon me, might you
know where the host
of the party is?

22:28.481 --> 22:29.682
Daniel Rudolph.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.918
Down the hall,
third door on the right.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.920
Thank you very much.

22:34.020 --> 22:35.522
You're welcome, ladies.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.490
Come along, Harriet.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.659
Yes, Winnie.
Thank you.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.348
Excuse me, sir.

23:02.449 --> 23:05.317
Excuse me.
This is a private room.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.454
If you ladies are
looking for the raw bar,

23:07.554 --> 23:09.055
it's in the bathroom
down the hall.

23:09.155 --> 23:12.291
We're not looking
for the raw bar.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.461
Are you Daniel Rudolph?

23:19.566 --> 23:20.800
Who wants to know?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.669
I want to know.

23:24.471 --> 23:25.505
Who's I?

23:25.605 --> 23:28.475
This is Walter Blunt.
Stop playing games.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.109
Oh, Mr. Blunt!

23:30.209 --> 23:31.978
I've been waiting for you.
You have?

23:32.078 --> 23:35.314
No, no, I just
say that to everyone.
Makes them feel special.

23:35.482 --> 23:38.718
Girls, could you please
give us some privacy?

23:40.186 --> 23:41.954
Same again, please.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.558
Thank you.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.494
Hey there, doll face.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.829
Polly want a cracker?

23:49.929 --> 23:51.330
Barry?

23:51.498 --> 23:53.500
Hey, you're that broad
who put a gun on me.

23:53.566 --> 23:54.967
No, I'm not.
Better take you
to the boss.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.503
Come on. Come on.
Come here!
No.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.638
Oh, damn!

24:00.139 --> 24:01.541
I've heard of you,
Mr. Blunt.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.976
My sister told me
the two of you are dating.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.779
I would hardly
call it dating.

24:06.879 --> 24:10.016
I would like to ask you
some questions, Mr. Rudolph.

24:10.116 --> 24:14.521
Oh, I could see why Margaret
likes you so much.

24:14.554 --> 24:17.089
You know,
if you didn't shave,

24:17.189 --> 24:19.792
you'd be
a good-looking woman.

24:19.892 --> 24:20.927
You, too.

24:21.027 --> 24:23.162
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.097
Let's quit
fooling around.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.999
I want to talk to you

24:27.099 --> 24:28.701
about the murders
you've had committed.

24:28.801 --> 24:32.539
Oh, is this
one of those plays
people put on at parties?

24:32.605 --> 24:35.007
Are you supposed to be
Angela Lansbury?

24:35.107 --> 24:37.109
Leave my brother
alone, Walter.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.548
Hello, Margaret.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.816
Danny, why don't
you run along?

24:43.916 --> 24:45.585
I can deal
with these two.

24:45.685 --> 24:48.588
The law says we can
shoot home invaders.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.589
Okay, Margie.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.562
Oh, fuck it.

25:04.571 --> 25:05.805
Okay, that's enough.

25:05.905 --> 25:06.939
Mm-hmm.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.677
Have you been
behind all of this?

25:10.777 --> 25:14.581
I thought it was your brother
and you were his helper.

25:14.647 --> 25:17.249
What a sexist
thing to say.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.218
Come on.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.187
You're not really
going to shoot us.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.623
Why didn't you call
after we made love?

25:23.723 --> 25:27.059
Because you drugged me
and stole the logbook.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.728
Still could have called.

25:28.828 --> 25:30.997
Turn around,
both of you.
Margaret.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.900
Turn around!
I fucking mean it!

25:37.604 --> 25:41.440
I liked you, Walter.
I really did.

25:41.608 --> 25:45.111
But you've made me
very unhappy,

25:45.211 --> 25:47.947
and I don't like
being unhappy.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.617
Life is too short.
