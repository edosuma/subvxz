01:32.134 --> 01:33.218
Hi.

01:33.886 --> 01:34.887
Hi.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.056
So…

01:41.935 --> 01:43.520
How was your bar mitzvah?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.522
It was great. Yeah.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.025
You missed a great night.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.070
Well, you missed a great night too.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.865
I didn't burn the chops.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.575
It was very special.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.954
-So, you managed the haftarah?
-Yes.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.581
And the hora?

02:03.457 --> 02:06.710
Yeah. It was amazing.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.588
I would've liked to have seen that.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.509
Maybe I should've come.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.555
Sorry. I feel like I'm making
all the wrong decisions at the moment.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.640
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.851
-What's going on?
-It's Daniel.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.022
He's hired this bloodsucking attorney

02:27.105 --> 02:30.651
who just wants to draw his pound
of fucking flesh from me.

02:31.235 --> 02:35.239
Some guy he met at racquetball
who's a partner at some big firm.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.242
You know where I got my divorce attorney?

02:38.784 --> 02:40.702
A fucking bus ad.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.914
Thought we were gonna do things
amicably, you know, like adults.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.834
But you know Daniel.
He's always so competitive.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.754
So I have to find someone.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.757
Someone good. Which is expensive.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.842
Right.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.103
Sorry, Marty.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.776
I know I said
last time would be the last time.

03:13.569 --> 03:14.570
It's fine.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.906
We need to get you sorted,
and that's what we'll do.

03:18.699 --> 03:22.411
Just tell me when. I'll call Irving.
I'm sure he'll be happy to help.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.704
Thank you.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.124
It's all right. It's all right.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.210
Everything's gonna be all right.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.565
Things are fine.

03:52.691 --> 03:53.817
Work's fine.

03:53.901 --> 03:59.031
I mean, I've been chasing down
a lot of late payments recently,

03:59.114 --> 04:02.326
which is hard because most of our clients
are old family friends.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.870
-I used to have the exact same problem.
-You did?

04:04.953 --> 04:06.413
Sure.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.709
Look, you can't be a therapist one minute
and then debt collector the next.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.586
So now when I have to be bad cop,

04:12.669 --> 04:17.007
I just send a letter from my lawyer,
Marshall Feldhammer.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.801
Did you know he got his law degree
when in prison for manslaughter?

04:19.885 --> 04:20.886
Wow.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.847
Good for him for turning his life around.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.851
And good for you for giving
someone like that an opportunity.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.770
-Well, he's not real.
-He's not?

04:29.853 --> 04:32.689
He's a fictional creation. My alter ego.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.400
Nobody knows.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.780
But you can bet your babka
they pay up when Marshall writes them.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.240
Wow.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.201
You know, I had an imaginary friend,
Norman Horowitz,

04:44.284 --> 04:46.203
-when I was growing up.
-Great name.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.205
He disappeared after drawing

04:48.288 --> 04:54.878
some very intricate genitalia
onto my parents' curtains.

04:55.671 --> 04:58.423
But maybe Norman Horowitz could become
my Marshall Feldhammer.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.551
I don't see why not.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.057
At some point,
we should talk about the genitalia thing.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.143
Now, how's the situation with Phyllis?

05:10.227 --> 05:11.812
The situation with Phyllis.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.022
Fine.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.528
You know what word I'm getting
a little tired of hearing from you, Marty?

05:20.863 --> 05:21.989
"Fine."

05:23.323 --> 05:24.533
Not everything is fine.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.870
You know, it's okay
for things to not be okay.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.872
So, really, how are you?

05:31.999 --> 05:34.376
Honestly, I really am…

05:35.961 --> 05:37.421
I--

05:39.548 --> 05:41.216
All right, new rule.

05:42.551 --> 05:47.181
Every time you say the f-word,
I'm going to issue you a fine.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.683
Oy, there we-- You know what? Look.

05:50.893 --> 05:51.727
Here we go.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.021
I just said it.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.607
Here's a dollar.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.900
Point taken.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.032
I was happy that Phyllis,
you know, came and made up.

06:05.574 --> 06:06.909
-I was.
-Yeah.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.076
But…

06:09.244 --> 06:12.164
now I'm just a little worried about some…

06:13.665 --> 06:15.417
some financial stuff.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.504
-Are you in trouble?
-No, it's not trouble.

06:18.587 --> 06:19.838
It's Phyllis.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.634
She needs me to unlock the trust.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.303
You know, and I'm happy to help.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.513
I really am.

06:27.596 --> 06:30.807
-Why is it up to you to help her?
-Well, my dad made me the executor.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.560
Because I'm more careful.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.812
With money, I mean.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.690
And the account is--
It's meant for emergencies.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.651
And Phyllis has had--

06:41.318 --> 06:43.028
She's had a lot of emergencies.

06:44.112 --> 06:48.283
You know, businesses that have gone bust
and needed bailing out.

06:48.367 --> 06:51.286
-And ideas that have gone nowhere.
-I see.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.121
And the money's not unlimited.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.582
It's meant to last
for the rest of our lives.

06:55.666 --> 06:59.837
And it's not like AFC is,
you know, bringing in huge profits.

07:01.672 --> 07:02.798
It's more the opposite.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.758
Why does she need the money?

07:06.343 --> 07:07.553
For her divorce.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.888
-Now I see what bothers you.
-What?

07:11.056 --> 07:13.183
Did she come to see you to say sorry?

07:13.267 --> 07:16.228
Or did she come to see you
because she needed money?

07:16.311 --> 07:17.312
Well, I--

07:17.896 --> 07:19.314
I have to believe that she came--

07:19.398 --> 07:22.484
You have to be careful
not to enable unhealthy behavior.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.862
For her sake just as much as yours.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.030
She's the only family, you know, I have.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.741
Yeah. And she's a whole lot of family.

07:30.701 --> 07:31.702
What do you mean?

07:31.785 --> 07:33.412
She's your sister,

07:34.746 --> 07:37.666
but you look to her
to fill the role of a parent.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.419
Meanwhile, you're her brother,

07:41.253 --> 07:43.714
but she's looking to you
to play the role of her husband.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.798
It's…

07:45.716 --> 07:47.467
It's an unhealthy dynamic.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.639
Yeah, I never thought of it that way.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.811
Looks like
we're gonna have to wrap this up,

07:57.895 --> 08:03.108
but I would like to get into
this sibling stuff next time, okay?

08:03.192 --> 08:05.527
-Sure. Thanks, Dr. Ike.
-Okay.

08:05.611 --> 08:08.363
By the way, I might have
a piece of business for you.

08:08.447 --> 08:09.615
Really?

08:09.698 --> 08:11.950
One of my patients is a Broadway producer.

08:12.034 --> 08:14.203
He needs fabric for his new show,
so I thought of you.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.207
Well, that sounds like
an incredible opportunity.

08:18.290 --> 08:19.291
Thank you.

08:20.792 --> 08:21.960
I just--

08:22.044 --> 08:24.004
I don't think I can handle
something that big.

08:25.839 --> 08:26.965
Your call.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.969
I provide the opportunity,
not the outcome.

08:31.762 --> 08:34.472
You just mentioned
that AFC was struggling…

08:35.974 --> 08:37.643
so maybe it's time for you to reach.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.144
Stretch yourself.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.605
No more just being "fine."

08:54.034 --> 08:56.537
-Marty? Marty Markowitz?
-Yes.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.705
-Hop on up here so we can chat.
-All right.

08:58.789 --> 09:01.041
Promise it's a much quicker route
than Juilliard.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.335
My goodness.

09:04.628 --> 09:05.963
So, you're Ike's guy?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.256
Yes.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.674
Hell of a therapist.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.509
Helped me through two divorces.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.678
Fingers crossed.
We'll be working on a third soon.

09:13.345 --> 09:16.974
Anyway, we're doing Jesus Christ Superstar
in less than one month.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.267
Do you know it?

09:18.851 --> 09:21.770
Never met him personally,
but I'm familiar with his work.

09:22.855 --> 09:25.482
So, the director has this whole vision

09:25.566 --> 09:28.193
-where our backdrop shimmers and shines…
-Okay.

09:28.277 --> 09:31.029
…and leads the messiah up
to the very heavens themselves.

09:31.613 --> 09:32.823
But let me tell you,

09:32.906 --> 09:35.492
the director is not
an inexpensive director.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.996
Hence, as portals to paradise go,
this needs to be cheap.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.455
I understand.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.375
I'm gonna be up-front with you though.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.711
We've never done a job this big before.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.423
So, why the hell would Ike set this up
if you can't do the job?

09:51.717 --> 09:53.010
Well--

09:53.093 --> 09:55.804
Well, I said we've never done it,
I didn't say we can't.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.848
We're really branching out these days.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.309
Yeah,
I don't wanna be anyone's guinea pig.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.186
I'm sorry you came all the way up here--

10:02.269 --> 10:04.771
Look, let me tell you something, Benny.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.524
You said "guinea pig."

10:09.693 --> 10:12.529
I went through a huge
guinea pig phase in high school.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.614
I did.

10:14.156 --> 10:19.286
And they are
absolutely majestic creatures.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.539
We should all be so lucky
to be a guinea pig.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.588
Let me go talk to my team.

10:29.671 --> 10:30.964
We'll get back to you.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.425
I'm sure we can help you.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.802
I'm not sure we can help him.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.722
Okay. Come on, guys. Let's think.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.141
Outside the box, right?

10:41.225 --> 10:44.228
This is a big opportunity for us.
I mean, this is exciting.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.772
How would we even get our hands
on that much fabric?

10:47.439 --> 10:49.149
Come on, Bruce.
What about all our suppliers?

10:49.233 --> 10:50.859
There must be someone
who delivers in bulk.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.445
Well, sure, Marty.
But this amount of fabric, I mean--

10:53.529 --> 10:55.572
We're looking at 20 grand
before we even treat it.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.866
Really? Then the treatment--

10:57.950 --> 10:59.284
Another 20%.

11:01.370 --> 11:07.084
Okay. So, who has an idea
on how we could begin to cut costs?

11:08.293 --> 11:10.045
-Bruce.
-I wasn't raising my hand.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.507
It's okay. There's no bad ideas.
We're just spitballing.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.551
Whatever's in your mind. Whatever's on--

11:15.634 --> 11:17.719
You know, just, please-- Just--

11:17.803 --> 11:21.014
Someone say a bad idea
just to get the ball rolling.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.599
I would love to hear a bad idea.

11:22.683 --> 11:26.144
What if we used…

11:27.563 --> 11:28.605
aluminum foil?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.858
Bruce,
what the hell are you talking about?

11:30.941 --> 11:33.777
-You wanted a bad idea.
-Okay. I'm sorry, you're right.

11:33.861 --> 11:37.322
Cathy, what's the first thing
that just pops into your head?

11:38.115 --> 11:39.116
Don't think.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.076
Fondue.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.955
Right. Okay, try again.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.165
Just spit it out. Don't judge it.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.627
Fondue. Sorry.

11:52.588 --> 11:57.301
All right. This, hands down, is
the worst meeting we've ever had, okay?

11:57.384 --> 12:00.220
I just want to go on record
as saying that.

12:00.304 --> 12:01.513
I couldn't rally them.

12:01.597 --> 12:05.851
They were just focused on
all the reasons, you know, as to why not.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.145
-You seem upset.
-I'm fine.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.235
I only have a 20. I--

12:16.111 --> 12:17.863
I keep forgetting to get change.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.159
Try again.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.827
I am upset. You're right.

12:24.786 --> 12:28.665
I mean, we get this great big chance,
thanks to you, and--

12:28.749 --> 12:30.501
But they were just so negative.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.214
The thing about obstacles is
you have a choice.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.091
You can either look at them as a hindrance

12:38.967 --> 12:40.385
-or as a gift.
-Right.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.013
They're either stumbling blocks
or stepping-stones.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.097
Yeah.

12:44.181 --> 12:50.354
Because an obstacle forces you
to adapt, learn and change.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.106
Yes. Exactly.

12:53.857 --> 12:56.985
You know, when you speak like that,

12:57.069 --> 12:58.695
I feel inspired.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.572
Like I could do anything.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.241
Have you ever thought about,

13:02.324 --> 13:06.328
and I don't even know
how you would describe it,

13:06.411 --> 13:10.415
but doing… industrial psychology?

13:11.208 --> 13:14.086
-What do you mean?
-My staff. They're stuck.

13:14.169 --> 13:15.546
They're stuck in the past.

13:16.672 --> 13:18.257
Maybe you could motivate them.

13:20.050 --> 13:23.053
Show them how to reach, you know?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.138
Teach them how to stretch.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.894
I've never done anything like that.

13:31.687 --> 13:35.482
Well, is that a hindrance or a gift?

13:40.445 --> 13:42.739
Thank you. Thank you.
It's an honor to be here.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.867
My name is Isaac Stevens.

13:44.950 --> 13:48.078
Marty was kind enough
to share this with me.

13:48.579 --> 13:52.249
The AFC code of conduct
and employee handbook.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.626
I assume you've all read it.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.003
-No.
-Yeah.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.212
No.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.673
-Yes.
-I read it last night.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.175
And it's a hell of a read.

14:03.260 --> 14:06.346
May I just make to you all
one modest suggestion?

14:10.601 --> 14:15.022
Forget the past. The future starts now.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.693
I'm here today to speak to you
about our mindsets

14:19.776 --> 14:22.779
because the first step
in changing our world

14:22.863 --> 14:24.865
-is to change how we see our world.
-Marty?

14:24.948 --> 14:26.116
-This make sense?
-Marty!

14:26.200 --> 14:30.037
Oh, my God. That lawyer
touched my ass three times.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.121
Mar--

14:31.997 --> 14:33.248
Sorry.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.377
-Here.
-I didn't know there was another--

14:37.461 --> 14:38.462
-Hi.
-I know.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.340
Sorry. Didn't mean--

14:41.423 --> 14:42.925
Come on in. We're workshopping.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.009
Are we?

14:44.092 --> 14:47.304
Cathy, can I ask you a question?
How do you make a flower grow?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.722
I usually don't.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.267
-What? Why you laughing? I don't.
-Cathy.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.311
Who the hell is this guy?

14:54.394 --> 14:56.146
Marty says
he's an industrial psychologist.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.899
-…and it dies, right? So…
-Yeah.

14:58.982 --> 15:02.694
Every single thing in the world
is like that flower.

15:02.778 --> 15:05.948
If we're not growing and flourishing,
we're dying.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.115
There's only two options.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.576
So, hands up.

15:09.660 --> 15:10.827
Who wants to live?

15:12.412 --> 15:15.332
Who wants their relationships
to thrive and flourish?

15:15.415 --> 15:18.168
Who wants their career
to thrive and flourish?

15:18.252 --> 15:22.172
Who wants every aspect of their life
to thrive and to flourish?

15:22.256 --> 15:24.216
Marty, can I talk to you for a second?

15:25.008 --> 15:26.176
Not now. Not now.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.344
Phyllis.

15:28.637 --> 15:29.638
Thrive and flourish?

15:30.347 --> 15:32.558
-What?
-Thrive and flourish?

15:35.269 --> 15:36.687
Sign me up.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.438
Please.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.276
Let's utilize the mindset
of unlimited potential

15:42.359 --> 15:46.071
to discuss this new business venture
the boss man wants to talk about. Marty?

15:48.448 --> 15:52.786
Okay, so, we have to figure out a way,
before tomorrow,

15:52.870 --> 15:57.082
to deliver a bid on the back cloth
without bankrupting ourselves.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.252
Any ideas on where to start?

16:00.335 --> 16:01.336
Not a clue.

16:01.420 --> 16:05.465
Remember, we start by taking a problem
and breaking it down into smaller parts.

16:05.549 --> 16:09.428
We could… break down
the cost of making this curtain?

16:09.511 --> 16:12.139
Love it. Somebody guard Bruce,
because he's in the zone.

16:16.602 --> 16:18.770
The materials cost $20,000.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.480
But that's before all the treatments--

16:21.648 --> 16:22.900
-What?
-Hear what I heard?

16:22.983 --> 16:25.319
-I heard a "but" statement.
-Yeah?

16:25.402 --> 16:26.445
Did I?

16:26.528 --> 16:28.780
You did. That's right. Sorry, Marty.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.782
Even the boss man's
gotta watch out for those.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.951
-All right.
-Do the crime, you do the time, my friend.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.912
Paying the fine right there.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.123
Sorry for the "but" statement, everybody.
Okay, let me rephrase.

16:38.207 --> 16:41.877
The treatments
add a lot of money to the bid.

16:42.753 --> 16:45.088
So, what are the treatments?

16:45.172 --> 16:48.800
There's sanitation and fire retardation.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.260
And then the labor.

16:50.344 --> 16:51.553
Fire retardation?

16:52.930 --> 16:55.224
How often do these things
actually catch fire?

16:55.307 --> 16:58.477
Not very, no. Technically
you don't need fire retardation.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.939
I mean, the chance of these things
going up in flames are very unlikely.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.983
It's unlikely
because of the fire retardation.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.069
Phyllis, have you ever
heard the expression

17:08.153 --> 17:09.655
"wet streets cause rain"?

17:09.738 --> 17:13.617
Have you ever heard the expression
"criminally negligent homicide"?

17:17.663 --> 17:19.705
We're trying to solve problems,
not create new ones.

17:19.790 --> 17:22.876
But the industry standard says
you have to fireproof your materials--

17:22.960 --> 17:23.961
-Phyllis!
-You're gonna--

17:24.044 --> 17:26.421
-I can't with the "but" crap.
-That's a "but" statement.

17:26.505 --> 17:27.798
Put a dollar in the jar.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.050
-But industry standards--
-Another "but" statement.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.135
-It's industry--
-Two back-to-back.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.220
I got you, Phyll.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.973
All right.
Look, what should we be asking ourselves?

17:36.056 --> 17:38.892
Think back to my workshop.
We got any alchemists in here?

17:38.976 --> 17:44.064
We should ask ourselves
how to turn this obstacle into a gift.

17:44.147 --> 17:45.607
Slam dunk, Bruce.

17:45.691 --> 17:47.276
-This is crazy.
-How can we do that?

17:47.359 --> 17:48.652
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Think.

17:48.735 --> 17:52.364
Well, we can't not fireproof them
because they're near the hot lights.

17:52.447 --> 17:55.158
Although I guess only the top part is.

17:57.411 --> 18:01.790
Unless we only fireproof the very top,

18:01.874 --> 18:04.877
which is the only part of the curtain
that could actually catch fire.

18:07.713 --> 18:09.339
Do you know what you're doing right now?

18:09.423 --> 18:11.216
-No.
-Really, you don't know?

18:12.050 --> 18:14.052
Any of you know what he's doing right now?

18:14.136 --> 18:15.387
-No.
-No.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.306
You're thinking with unlimited potential.

18:18.390 --> 18:19.516
That's what you're doing.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.019
You're thinking with unlimited potential.

18:22.978 --> 18:24.229
I'm sorry, but that's crazy.

18:24.313 --> 18:25.314
-You can't do that.
-No.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.941
You can't just fireproof
the top of a curtain…

18:28.025 --> 18:29.359
-No! No.
-…and call it a day.

18:29.443 --> 18:31.570
What's crazy is
no one's thought of this before.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.405
That's why he's the big kahuna.

18:33.488 --> 18:34.656
Surf's up.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.160
Take five. You've earned it.
I'm proud of you.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.287
I feel pumped.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.538
Do you feel pumped?

18:41.622 --> 18:43.540
-Are you pumped?
-Mega pumped.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.960
-We're going to Broadway, baby.
-Marty, is that Ike?

18:48.086 --> 18:49.171
Is that Dr. Ike?

18:51.173 --> 18:53.217
What is he doing here?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.843
Helping us. What do you think?

18:55.594 --> 18:56.803
He's been great for me.

18:56.887 --> 18:59.348
I thought he could help all of us.
And he did.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.642
Is he even allowed
to do this kind of a thing?

19:01.725 --> 19:04.978
He's a miracle worker.
He's changed my life.

19:05.062 --> 19:08.148
-I mean, he's changed me.
-Marty, I didn't want you to change.

19:08.232 --> 19:09.316
Well, I did.

19:10.025 --> 19:12.819
I didn't like old Marty. He was a mess.

19:12.903 --> 19:16.281
I mean, the fact that you and I could even
have this little argument right now

19:16.365 --> 19:19.076
without my bowels liquefying?

19:19.159 --> 19:20.452
That's a personal triumph.

19:20.536 --> 19:21.787
But I loved old Marty.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.872
No buts. No buts.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.294
Old Marty wasn't happy.

19:30.128 --> 19:33.131
Phyll, I can still be me, right?

19:33.924 --> 19:36.385
Be strong, confident.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.470
Be a man.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.848
Dr. Ike taught me that.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.810
Are you really buying this crap?

19:44.893 --> 19:46.979
All I know is Dr. Ike makes me happy.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.398
But this conversation's
not making me happy.

19:51.817 --> 19:55.237
See, ever since he turned up,
we've been fighting.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.407
So stop fighting. Give him a chance.

19:59.491 --> 20:01.368
-I--
-Okay, okay.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.954
I'll try, but--
I mean, I'm trying. I'm trying.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.081
Yeah. Okay.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.920
What a day. It was amazing.

20:12.004 --> 20:14.006
So much fun. So exciting.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.341
-That's great, honey.
-You know, I love what I do.

20:16.425 --> 20:19.720
But you can't solve mother issues
in a few hours.

20:19.803 --> 20:22.222
But this time, we rolled up our sleeves,
figured it out,

20:22.306 --> 20:24.141
and now the result's gonna be on Broadway.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.476
-It sounds like you saved the day.
-Yeah, I kinda did.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.854
-And I made a pretty good chunk of change.
-Really?

20:28.937 --> 20:31.440
Yeah. Marty has to pay me
for the entire workshop,

20:31.523 --> 20:34.401
plus every appointment I canceled
just to make it work.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.737
Wow. Is that okay?

20:36.820 --> 20:38.447
I mean, is that allowed?

20:39.615 --> 20:41.533
Well, I did the work, didn't I?

20:42.159 --> 20:44.870
-I know. It just seems--
-You know, it's funny.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.167
Helping people see their potential
reminded me of my potential.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.543
All the things I wanna do.

20:51.627 --> 20:54.087
Yeah, but you're so good
at what you do already.

20:54.171 --> 20:55.714
I know, but I wanna do more.

20:55.797 --> 20:59.384
I wanna write books. I wanna teach.
I wanna start a business.

20:59.468 --> 21:01.887
I've been telling Marty
for months that he needs to reach.

21:01.970 --> 21:04.765
Stretch himself.
I should listen to my own advice.

21:04.848 --> 21:06.350
Wow.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.644
I mean, well, this is so amazing

21:08.727 --> 21:13.315
because, well, I've actually been thinking
about going back to school.

21:13.398 --> 21:16.026
So maybe tomorrow
I'll go pick up an application.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.820
Hon, that costs money.
That doesn't make money.

21:18.904 --> 21:21.615
No, I know. But in terms
of reaching and stretching myself.

21:21.698 --> 21:23.325
You're so funny.

21:23.408 --> 21:27.371
Why are you so threatened
by me having a single goal for myself?

21:29.373 --> 21:31.041
I'm not threatened.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.377
-No, I think it's-- It's sweet.
-All right.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.587
-Good night, Ike. I'm going to bed.
-No, no, no, no.

21:35.671 --> 21:37.464
-Come on, don't be like that.
-Like what?

21:37.548 --> 21:38.882
-Like--
-Tired?

21:38.966 --> 21:39.967
Okay.

21:41.009 --> 21:44.513
You know that I think
you're brilliant and beautiful.

21:45.222 --> 21:47.516
And your happiness means
more to me than anything.

21:47.599 --> 21:48.851
Really?

21:48.934 --> 21:51.937
I'm beginning to think
this is a very exciting time for us.

21:52.813 --> 21:53.814
Yeah.

21:54.439 --> 21:55.566
Yeah, no, I do too.

21:55.649 --> 21:57.901
My little shaina maidel. My little…

22:01.071 --> 22:02.614
You wanna hear my AFC speech?

22:02.698 --> 22:04.741
-Right now?
-Yeah. It's 40 minutes.

22:06.743 --> 22:07.619
Yeah.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.461
Well, thank you for seeing me.

22:17.838 --> 22:18.839
You're welcome.

22:18.922 --> 22:22.551
Marty doesn't know I'm here.
I'd like to keep it private.

22:22.634 --> 22:25.179
Sure. What do you want to talk about?

22:26.722 --> 22:28.432
I think we both know that.

22:29.892 --> 22:30.934
Marty.

22:31.018 --> 22:34.479
I know. You'll think I'm overprotective.

22:35.439 --> 22:37.816
I always say he's my fourth child.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.568
But he's not a child.

22:41.069 --> 22:44.031
And he's not your child. He's a grown man.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.867
Maybe you don't give him enough credit.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.118
Maybe not.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.913
But I do know what's right.

22:53.415 --> 22:59.463
And a therapist throwing a bar mitzvah
for a patient is not normal.

22:59.546 --> 23:03.509
And a therapist coming
to a patient's place of business

23:03.592 --> 23:04.760
is not normal.

23:05.719 --> 23:07.137
There needs to be boundaries.

23:07.221 --> 23:11.558
Says the woman who calls my rabbi
and comes to my office to snoop on me.

23:12.851 --> 23:14.478
How's that for boundaries?

23:15.479 --> 23:16.480
You know…

23:17.898 --> 23:19.816
I'm actually glad you came, Phyllis.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.488
Because while you're concerned
for your brother,

23:25.364 --> 23:26.698
I'm concerned for you.

23:26.782 --> 23:28.825
-Me?
-Yes, you.

23:28.909 --> 23:32.162
You've lost both your parents.
You're going through a divorce.

23:32.246 --> 23:35.207
And yet you come here
because you're worried about Marty.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.918
My question is, who worries about Phyllis?

23:38.627 --> 23:40.587
Who looks after Phyllis?

23:40.671 --> 23:44.800
For once in your life,
why don't you put yourself first?

23:44.883 --> 23:48.846
Something tells me you don't get the
chance to talk about yourself very often.

23:50.222 --> 23:51.974
That's true. I don't.

23:52.057 --> 23:55.102
So let's forget about Marty.
Let's talk about you.

23:58.021 --> 24:01.024
Tell me again,
what's your ex-husband's name?

24:02.484 --> 24:03.777
Daniel.

24:03.861 --> 24:07.447
Daniel? Okay.
Do I have permission to call him prick?

24:10.951 --> 24:11.952
You do.

24:13.579 --> 24:15.163
So what about the prick?

24:16.123 --> 24:17.124
You know…

24:19.168 --> 24:20.961
I looked after his parents.

24:21.044 --> 24:23.755
I gave him a family.

24:23.839 --> 24:28.468
I invested everything in him,
while my own business suffered,

24:29.428 --> 24:34.766
and the second
he finds an ounce of success,

24:35.434 --> 24:40.189
he starts up with this woman
that works for him.

24:42.316 --> 24:43.692
That must be so painful.

24:45.444 --> 24:46.612
It is.

24:50.449 --> 24:52.826
Sounds to me like you haven't been
appreciated enough.

24:52.910 --> 24:55.078
-No, I haven't.
-What about what you want?

24:55.162 --> 24:56.955
Your potential?

24:57.039 --> 24:59.333
Or have you been too busy
taking care of everybody else?

24:59.416 --> 25:00.417
That.

25:00.501 --> 25:03.003
Well, I think you're very brave, Phyllis.

25:06.048 --> 25:07.132
Thank you.

25:07.216 --> 25:09.301
And I can see how strong you are.

25:14.389 --> 25:16.058
Thank you, Dr. Herschkopf.

25:18.894 --> 25:23.482
Tell me, what was your relationship
with your father like?

25:23.565 --> 25:26.109
He was pretty hard on me.

25:26.193 --> 25:27.569
Harder than on Marty?

25:30.614 --> 25:34.034
I thought we weren't talking about Marty.

25:35.744 --> 25:38.330
-Only when it's relevant.
-Okay, okay.

25:39.748 --> 25:43.544
Marty was the boy, the golden child.

25:43.627 --> 25:48.257
He could get away with… anything.

25:51.593 --> 25:52.845
But with me…

25:55.264 --> 25:56.598
I don't know, we…

26:01.353 --> 26:05.357
I could never live up
to my father's expectations.

26:06.775 --> 26:09.945
So you spent your entire life
pleasing everyone else

26:10.028 --> 26:11.864
because you couldn't please your father.

26:19.413 --> 26:20.789
Maybe.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.793
Yeah, that kind of makes sense.

26:26.170 --> 26:29.882
You're really, really perceptive.

26:33.343 --> 26:34.595
I'm just seeing a pattern.

26:37.973 --> 26:39.016
Thank you.

26:39.641 --> 26:40.726
The good news is that

26:40.809 --> 26:44.479
recognizing the pattern is the first step
to changing things.

26:44.563 --> 26:46.815
You don't have to be
your brother's parent anymore.

26:46.899 --> 26:48.942
You don't have to be your parents' parent.

26:49.026 --> 26:52.654
You don't have to be the prick's parent.
You finally get to be you.

26:54.406 --> 26:55.490
How does that sound?

26:55.574 --> 26:57.326
I gotta tell you, that sounds good.

26:58.285 --> 26:59.953
Mom and Dad are no longer here,

27:00.037 --> 27:02.080
Marty's finally growing up,

27:02.164 --> 27:06.084
you no longer have to pander
to the prick's wants

27:06.168 --> 27:11.215
or have to prove yourself
with endless ill-fated business schemes.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.259
Wait, what?

27:15.719 --> 27:16.720
What?

27:16.803 --> 27:18.722
No, what did you just say?

27:19.306 --> 27:21.433
I said you don't need to pander
to the prick's wants

27:21.517 --> 27:23.268
-and needs any--
-No. After that?

27:24.061 --> 27:26.772
Business? You don't have to worry
about your-- the business.

27:26.855 --> 27:29.066
-I didn't tell you that.
-You--

27:29.149 --> 27:31.068
No, I said that I started my…

27:32.903 --> 27:35.239
I started my own business, but I didn't…

27:36.865 --> 27:38.492
-Who told you that?
-You did.

27:38.575 --> 27:41.328
No, I didn't. Did Marty tell you that?

27:42.120 --> 27:45.582
Look,
the point is, you're finally free to do--

27:45.666 --> 27:49.253
No.
The point is, this does not feel right.

27:50.587 --> 27:53.215
Come on.
Hey, we were making real progress there.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.717
-Come on, sit.
-Thank you, Doctor.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.345
I appreciate you seeing me.

28:00.013 --> 28:03.267
And I am grateful you've been
able to help my brother.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.271
What's the problem, Phyllis?

28:07.354 --> 28:10.190
Because it seems like
you've got a problem with me.

28:10.274 --> 28:14.444
You're a nice guy,
and you're a good therapist.

28:14.528 --> 28:16.029
And I don't have your brains,

28:17.072 --> 28:20.492
or your education, or your qualifications.

28:21.952 --> 28:23.829
But I do have good instincts.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.165
And I don't trust you, Dr. Herschkopf.

28:29.042 --> 28:30.502
So you be careful.

28:32.629 --> 28:34.256
Because I will be watching you.

28:41.221 --> 28:44.725
That looks great, guys.
Thank you. Thank you for the effort.

28:46.059 --> 28:49.104
-Hey, Dr. Ike.
-Hi, Marty.

28:49.188 --> 28:50.230
What do you think?

28:51.523 --> 28:52.691
It looks amazing.

28:52.774 --> 28:55.819
It does, doesn't it?
And it's all thanks to you.

28:57.446 --> 28:59.740
We've made some remarkable progress.

29:01.450 --> 29:03.452
It's such a shame it has to end.

29:07.122 --> 29:09.416
Your sister came to see me.

29:09.499 --> 29:12.002
-What?
-Phyllis came to my office.

29:12.085 --> 29:14.713
I don't understand what you're saying.

29:15.380 --> 29:16.215
Phyllis?

29:16.298 --> 29:20.677
This woman has
a personal vendetta against me.

29:20.761 --> 29:22.304
That's not true.

29:22.387 --> 29:25.015
Me going to therapy,
that was her idea, remember?

29:25.098 --> 29:26.141
-I told you that before.
-Yes.

29:26.225 --> 29:27.809
Because she wants to keep you functioning.

29:27.893 --> 29:30.687
Because she wants to use you for money,

29:30.771 --> 29:32.105
for watching her kids--

29:32.189 --> 29:34.191
When are you gonna finally
stand up to this woman?

29:34.274 --> 29:36.151
Because neither of you will grow
until you do.

29:36.235 --> 29:39.821
You're certainly not gonna find a wife,
not while she's behaving like she's yours.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.532
I'm sorry, Marty.

29:42.407 --> 29:44.284
I can't work like this. I'm out.

29:44.368 --> 29:45.827
No, don't say that.

29:45.911 --> 29:47.871
I want to treat you, Marty.

29:47.955 --> 29:49.873
-I wanna help.
-You are helping me.

29:49.957 --> 29:52.584
But I won't put up
with this kind of nonsense.

29:52.668 --> 29:55.420
-That's a "but" statement.
-Sometimes we need "but" statements.

29:55.504 --> 29:57.256
Sometimes "but" statements are boundaries.

29:57.339 --> 30:00.175
Dr. Ike, I promise. You won't
ever have to deal with her again.

30:00.259 --> 30:02.594
I'll talk to her.
She's just in a bad place.

30:02.678 --> 30:04.972
And she wants to drag you down with her.

30:05.055 --> 30:07.224
She wants to keep you frozen in time.

30:07.307 --> 30:10.143
Marty, you have made such great progress.

30:10.227 --> 30:12.813
And you're on the cusp
of something wonderful.

30:14.064 --> 30:18.110
I'm sorry that we can't finish
our work together.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.446
Dr. Ike, please.

30:21.530 --> 30:22.823
Enjoy opening night.

30:23.740 --> 30:27.703
And you can tell your sister she wins.

30:28.245 --> 30:29.830
-She can have you.
-Look…

30:31.039 --> 30:34.334
I need you. I don't want
to have to choose between you.

30:34.418 --> 30:37.671
You don't have to. I would never come
between a brother and his sister.

30:38.630 --> 30:41.300
Not even when I can see
one is destroying the other.

30:43.969 --> 30:45.262
Good luck, Marty.

30:53.604 --> 30:56.190
Sorry, Irving.
It's not like Marty to be late.

30:57.065 --> 30:59.109
-No, no, Phyllis. It's fine.
-Okay.

30:59.193 --> 31:01.904
While we're waiting, why don't you tell me
what we're doing today?

31:02.529 --> 31:07.409
Basically, I need to transfer money
from the trust into my personal account,

31:07.492 --> 31:09.036
and pronto.

31:09.745 --> 31:11.997
Otherwise, I have to sell my kids
to Gypsies.

31:12.956 --> 31:15.334
Wait, what?

31:15.417 --> 31:17.002
It's a figure of speech, hon.

31:17.836 --> 31:19.713
-Happy to help.
-Thank you.

31:19.796 --> 31:23.050
So, in order to transfer the money,
you need to fill out this one form.

31:23.133 --> 31:24.885
We'll get it for you. Sign it.

31:24.968 --> 31:27.471
And then Marty needs to sign
the other one.

31:28.180 --> 31:30.849
Okay, great.
Well, he'll be here any minute, I'm--

31:31.725 --> 31:32.726
Okay.

31:33.393 --> 31:35.395
You wanna not hover, maybe?

31:36.438 --> 31:37.856
Join the kids, please?

31:38.857 --> 31:41.527
You're making me nervous.
Just sit down, please. Please.

31:55.916 --> 31:57.292
Marty?

31:57.376 --> 31:58.710
Excuse me.

31:59.336 --> 32:00.379
Where have you been?

32:00.462 --> 32:01.797
Where have you been?

32:02.297 --> 32:04.591
Waiting for you at the lawyer's.

32:04.675 --> 32:07.344
And before that? You went to Dr. Ike's.

32:08.637 --> 32:09.930
See?

32:10.681 --> 32:11.682
See?

32:12.975 --> 32:16.144
He told you.
I said not to tell you, and he did.

32:16.228 --> 32:17.729
It was a test, and he failed.

32:17.813 --> 32:21.275
You need to start treating me with respect
and stop undermining me.

32:28.490 --> 32:29.491
Look, Marty.

32:31.994 --> 32:35.747
I get the appeal, okay?
He was very nice in our session.

32:37.499 --> 32:40.502
But he just has no boundaries,
and I don't trust him.

32:40.586 --> 32:43.130
Well, you're not exactly
the greatest judge of men.

32:43.213 --> 32:45.174
Look, I can't deal
with your bullshit right now.

32:45.257 --> 32:48.427
And I can't deal with you
continually dragging me down,

32:48.510 --> 32:50.721
trying to keep me frozen in time.

32:50.804 --> 32:51.972
Stop behaving like a dick,

32:52.055 --> 32:54.725
and unlock the trust so I can deal
with the other dick in my life.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.310
No. I'm not gonna do that.

32:56.810 --> 32:58.145
I have to stop enabling you.

32:58.228 --> 33:00.689
What are you talking about, enabling me?
It's my money.

33:00.772 --> 33:02.941
Neither of us are going to
continue to grow

33:03.025 --> 33:04.860
if I just give in to you all the time.

33:04.943 --> 33:07.946
-That's him, isn't it?
-Mom and Dad put me in charge.

33:08.030 --> 33:11.200
And if I just continue to give you money,
you're never going to learn.

33:11.283 --> 33:13.702
So, yes, I have to stop enabling you.

33:18.373 --> 33:19.708
That's not you talking.

33:20.751 --> 33:22.336
That's Dr. Fuckface.

33:22.419 --> 33:27.966
No, this is me telling you
that currently at this time,

33:28.050 --> 33:31.136
this relationship does not have
healthy boundaries.

33:31.220 --> 33:33.597
What are you even talking about,
healthy boundaries?

33:33.680 --> 33:36.934
Your shrink had a workshop
in your fucking office, Marty!

33:37.017 --> 33:40.604
You're the one who called the rabbi
about my bar mitzvah!

33:40.687 --> 33:43.607
-Oh, my God.
-You treat me like a child.

33:45.192 --> 33:49.112
God forbid you feel like a child
at your bar mitzvah.

33:49.196 --> 33:51.949
And then you go to my therapist?

33:52.032 --> 33:56.703
How dare you deprive me of my money
because your therapist told you to.

33:56.787 --> 33:58.163
This is my decision.

33:59.289 --> 34:03.502
I'm sure you think it is, Marty,
because he's living in your goddamn head.

34:05.420 --> 34:09.550
So when I say this, I hope
the both of you can hear me in there.

34:11.510 --> 34:14.221
Hey, Marty. Hey, Ike.

34:14.304 --> 34:15.681
Fuck you!

34:31.530 --> 34:32.531
Hi.

34:32.614 --> 34:34.699
Hi, Bonnie. So nice to see you.

34:34.783 --> 34:37.703
You too. Are you okay?
You look a little pale.

34:37.786 --> 34:39.079
Tough day.

34:39.955 --> 34:40.956
Come on in.

34:41.039 --> 34:43.417
Okay. All right.

34:52.009 --> 34:53.927
Do you know how proud I am of you?

34:54.594 --> 34:58.765
You set boundaries, you reached,
and now look where it landed you.

35:00.184 --> 35:01.894
Thanks, Dr. Ike, that means a lot.

35:02.561 --> 35:05.022
Check out that backdrop.
That's our backdrop.

35:05.105 --> 35:06.690
They're looking at our backdrop!

35:06.773 --> 35:09.067
-They are.
-It looks terrific, the drape.

35:09.693 --> 35:10.694
Gorgeous.

35:18.911 --> 35:21.163
I don't know

35:21.246 --> 35:25.918
-Is she holding a candle?
-How to love him

35:26.502 --> 35:29.630
You told them that you minimized
the fire retardation, right?

35:29.713 --> 35:33.800
No. No, I just said these are special
curtains for a special performance.

35:36.303 --> 35:38.138
Nah, I'm sure it'll be fine.

35:38.222 --> 35:39.431
Yeah. Right?

35:39.515 --> 35:41.517
He really does look like Jesus.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.770
When I've seen myself

35:44.853 --> 35:46.605
Wait, now there's another candle coming.

35:47.231 --> 35:49.399
Yeah. Yeah.

35:49.483 --> 35:52.277
Okay, now there's three candles.
Three real candles up there.

35:52.361 --> 35:54.571
Now there's--
Yeah, now there's three of them.

35:54.655 --> 35:56.657
A little too close to the gauze
for my liking.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.992
-Yeah, I wish they would come downstage.
-Right.

35:59.076 --> 36:01.411
-If they traveled downstage, then--
-It'd be better.

36:01.495 --> 36:04.164
Just one more

36:04.248 --> 36:05.499
What are--

36:06.041 --> 36:09.336
Should I bring him down?

36:10.504 --> 36:11.839
Geez, that's a lot of candles.

36:11.922 --> 36:14.550
I mean, this is not period accurate.

36:15.175 --> 36:16.927
They didn't have candles back then.

36:17.010 --> 36:18.887
Oh, God. What is that, a torch?

36:19.888 --> 36:22.015
I never thought I'd come to this

36:22.099 --> 36:24.434
Is that real fire, or is it stage fire?

36:24.518 --> 36:26.687
What the fuck is stage fire?

36:26.770 --> 36:29.439
-It's like a luau.
-Or a Klan rally.

36:30.274 --> 36:31.775
Jesus is so flexible.

36:31.859 --> 36:33.277
Do you smell smoke?

36:33.360 --> 36:34.945
-Yes.
-I smell smoke.

36:35.028 --> 36:37.030
Does anyone else? Do you smell smoke?

36:37.114 --> 36:38.115
No?

36:38.198 --> 36:39.950
Oh, God. Don't run! Please.

36:40.742 --> 36:42.202
I think I'm gonna be sick.

36:42.286 --> 36:44.830
We're gonna be up in flames
in about ten min--

36:44.913 --> 36:46.456
Someone's gotta pull the fire alarm.

36:46.540 --> 36:49.042
-Yep. Go do it.
-I'm gonna go pull the fire alarm.

36:49.126 --> 36:51.170
-Go pull-- Go pull the alarm.
-I love him so

36:51.253 --> 36:52.838
-Pull it.
-I'm gonna go pull the fire alarm.

36:52.921 --> 36:54.298
I'm just gonna do it.

37:04.975 --> 37:08.562
Okay. Okay. Okay.

37:13.692 --> 37:15.485
Hey. Hiya, Don.

37:15.569 --> 37:17.905
-Is Marty around?
-Yeah, he's actually out.

37:18.447 --> 37:20.574
-Out?
-He went out a while ago.

37:20.657 --> 37:23.952
Okay. Well, he'll be back soon.
I'll just go wait for him.

37:24.036 --> 37:25.162
-Sure. Head up there.
-Okay.

39:08.682 --> 39:10.559
Two different people
complimented the backdrop.

39:10.642 --> 39:11.685
Two?

39:11.768 --> 39:13.395
Oh, my gosh. It's like a dream.

39:13.478 --> 39:15.814
It was a great backdrop.

39:15.898 --> 39:17.816
You're getting more clients, trust me.

39:18.859 --> 39:20.777
Oh, my God. Code red.

39:20.861 --> 39:22.654
Is that Raul Julia over there?

39:22.738 --> 39:23.906
Five o'clock.

39:24.740 --> 39:25.824
I think it is.

39:26.867 --> 39:29.703
Ike, I'm kind of tired. Should we go home?

39:29.786 --> 39:32.539
Home? What-- It's opening night.

39:32.623 --> 39:35.501
Your husband's the king of Broadway.
The night is still young.

39:35.584 --> 39:37.002
That is definitely Raul Julia.

39:37.085 --> 39:41.173
Okay. Well, I'll get a cab,
and you boys stay out and have fun.

39:41.256 --> 39:42.382
You've earned it.

39:43.091 --> 39:44.092
All right.

39:44.635 --> 39:46.929
-Great job.
-Thanks, Bonnie. Good night.

39:47.012 --> 39:48.055
-Marty.
-What?

39:48.138 --> 39:50.390
Take my picture,
but angle it so Raul's in it.

39:50.474 --> 39:51.725
Okay.

40:03.153 --> 40:04.446
One step to the right.

40:06.156 --> 40:07.324
Yeah.

40:08.951 --> 40:10.160
Baby step, there.

40:11.078 --> 40:13.747
Yeah. Good, good.

40:22.673 --> 40:24.049
-Did you get it?
-Oh, I got it.

40:24.132 --> 40:25.133
Yeah?

40:26.009 --> 40:27.636
-Perfect.
-What a night.

40:27.719 --> 40:29.930
-Amazing.
-See what happens when you reach?

40:30.013 --> 40:30.931
Well done, Marty.

40:31.014 --> 40:32.933
No. I mean, this is all because of you.

40:33.016 --> 40:36.019
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't you dare deflect.

40:36.103 --> 40:38.605
You should be proud of yourself.
I'm proud of you.

40:38.689 --> 40:41.817
I mean,
I'll never be able to thank you enough.

40:41.900 --> 40:42.901
No.

40:45.946 --> 40:46.989
Unless…

40:48.073 --> 40:50.576
Would you ever consider
coming to work at AFC?

40:50.659 --> 40:53.036
You know, like as a full-time consultant?

40:53.120 --> 40:54.246
Are you serious?

40:54.872 --> 40:57.791
Yes. I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you.

40:58.333 --> 41:00.377
Look what we can achieve together.

41:07.009 --> 41:10.012
Well, let me think-- Okay.

41:10.637 --> 41:12.306
I thought you were gonna say no.

41:12.389 --> 41:15.642
No, I think it's a wonderful--
It's wonderful.

41:15.726 --> 41:16.977
All right.

41:17.060 --> 41:18.061
Wow.

41:18.145 --> 41:19.646
-I mean--
-What a night.

41:19.730 --> 41:22.399
-It gets better and better and better.
-And better.

41:23.692 --> 41:27.571
I swear I saw Daniel J. Travanti
at the bar.

41:27.654 --> 41:28.989
-Hill Street?
-Hill Street.

41:29.072 --> 41:30.824
Let's go. We'll get a picture with him.

42:06.652 --> 42:07.653
Hello?

42:20.791 --> 42:23.502
Shit. Shit.

42:42.688 --> 42:43.897
God.

42:48.652 --> 42:50.737
-Hello?
-Dr. Ike, it's Marty.

42:50.821 --> 42:52.406
I'm having an emergency.

42:52.489 --> 42:55.492
Oh, my-- Buddy, it's 2:00 a.m., all right?

42:55.576 --> 42:58.287
-We'll talk in our next session.
-Wait. I've been robbed.

42:59.037 --> 43:00.080
By Phyllis.

43:00.914 --> 43:01.915
What?

43:03.125 --> 43:04.168
What did she steal?

43:04.251 --> 43:05.586
The jewelry.

43:05.669 --> 43:07.796
Well, my parents' jewelry
that we inherited.

43:07.880 --> 43:10.841
I don't know how much. Probably…

43:12.217 --> 43:14.511
Probably half a million worth.

43:16.471 --> 43:17.472
Hello?

43:18.390 --> 43:19.391
Hello?

43:19.474 --> 43:22.394
We need to meet tomorrow
for an emergency session.

43:22.477 --> 43:24.855
-We need a full estimate.
-No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

43:24.938 --> 43:27.024
No, I can't.
I have to go out to the Hamptons house.

43:27.107 --> 43:30.736
There's a bunch of heirlooms there that
Phyllis could be stealing as we speak.

43:31.987 --> 43:34.865
And the Zurich accounts too, of course.
And the--

43:35.574 --> 43:37.659
And the bonds. Oh, my God.

43:38.410 --> 43:40.037
I feel like I could faint.

43:41.205 --> 43:43.081
The cops said that they would go tomorrow.

43:43.165 --> 43:44.958
-But that could be too late.
-Marty, stop.

43:45.042 --> 43:46.793
You need to protect your valuables.

43:46.877 --> 43:48.086
There's too much at stake.

43:48.170 --> 43:50.506
You need to go out
to the Hamptons house now.

43:51.340 --> 43:52.341
I'll go with you.

43:53.759 --> 43:54.635
You will?

43:54.718 --> 43:55.844
Yes, I will.

43:55.928 --> 43:58.597
Don't worry. I'll be right by your side.

43:58.680 --> 43:59.681
Okay, okay.

44:01.058 --> 44:02.059
Thank you.

44:06.271 --> 44:09.608
Her car's not here. That's a good sign.

44:17.324 --> 44:18.325
You grew up here?

44:18.408 --> 44:19.868
It's a summer house.

44:49.857 --> 44:52.526
I'm gonna go check upstairs.

45:00.158 --> 45:03.704
Okay, everything seems to be okay.
Knock on wood.

45:05.455 --> 45:07.040
Just gotta go check the safe.

45:34.735 --> 45:36.069
She didn't come.

45:37.654 --> 45:38.906
It's okay.

45:41.533 --> 45:42.868
We're okay.

45:42.951 --> 45:46.330
I'm sorry. I feel like I wasted your time.

45:46.413 --> 45:47.956
No. No, no, no.

45:50.167 --> 45:51.168
You both own this?

45:51.251 --> 45:55.756
I bought Phyllis's share a few years ago
to help her out…

45:57.925 --> 45:59.343
but she still has a key.

45:59.426 --> 46:00.761
Thank you.

46:00.844 --> 46:03.430
-Thank you so much for coming--
-How often do you come out here?

46:05.140 --> 46:07.476
A few times in the summer. I d--

46:07.559 --> 46:09.019
I forget sometimes. I don't know.

46:09.102 --> 46:12.898
I mean, it's just another-- another thing
from my parents I have to deal with.

46:12.981 --> 46:15.400
Yeah. Sure. No, I…

46:22.616 --> 46:23.659
You know, Marty,

46:25.369 --> 46:28.247
I think I have a new understanding
of what your problem is.

46:31.041 --> 46:32.125
You're rich.

46:33.418 --> 46:35.003
You have been given everything.

46:35.087 --> 46:37.714
Money, a business, a house.

46:38.423 --> 46:41.593
And because you haven't struggled,
you haven't learned to enjoy it

46:41.677 --> 46:42.761
or appreciate it.

46:43.762 --> 46:46.348
When people smell wealth,
they become animals.

46:46.431 --> 46:49.726
Your money might have protected you
as a child,

46:49.810 --> 46:51.979
but it's now made you a target
as an adult.

46:54.189 --> 46:55.399
And the truth is,

46:57.150 --> 46:58.527
people take advantage of you.

47:00.153 --> 47:01.321
And you let them.

47:02.114 --> 47:03.156
Phyllis did it.

47:03.991 --> 47:05.242
Deborah too.

47:05.325 --> 47:06.869
But what can I do about it?

47:06.952 --> 47:08.996
You don't have to do anything about it,

47:10.080 --> 47:12.249
because I'm going to look after you.

47:13.500 --> 47:17.087
I am going to take care of everything.

47:27.639 --> 47:29.141
Thanks, Dr. Ike.

47:29.224 --> 47:31.143
You're welcome, Marty.

47:33.103 --> 47:34.313
You're welcome.

47:40.235 --> 47:41.904
This is only the beginning.
