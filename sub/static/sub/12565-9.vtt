Previously on Royal Pains...

00:02.533 --> 00:03.950
Well, if you don't like our new rates,

00:04.067 --> 00:06.069
then, of course, you're free
to use another facility.

00:06.236 --> 00:08.571
You have the only imaging
and lab facilities in the area.

00:08.656 --> 00:10.073
- Yeah.
- Hankmed's looking to grow,

00:10.207 --> 00:12.075
and we're having trouble
finding the right space.

00:12.209 --> 00:13.743
Let's make this easy.

00:13.877 --> 00:14.911
Do it as partners.

00:15.045 --> 00:17.246
Hi. I'm Charlotte.

00:17.381 --> 00:19.048
Are you in town just to see Hank?

00:19.133 --> 00:20.750
I'm also here to consult with a surgeon

00:20.884 --> 00:23.052
that Hank knows who
does corneal transplants.

00:23.170 --> 00:24.971
We have a mysterious Emma who.

00:25.089 --> 00:27.140
I'm the not-so-mysterious Cinco.

00:27.257 --> 00:28.987
I took care of you earlier, birthday boy.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.315
You sliped me some?

00:30.315 --> 00:31.260
You not feeling it yet?

00:31.395 --> 00:33.763
Cinco, come on, you are out of control.

00:33.897 --> 00:35.264
Easy. Easy.

00:37.151 --> 00:38.596
Okay.

00:40.404 --> 00:42.605
I've been thinking about
your immigration hearing.

00:42.773 --> 00:45.775
Some of my patients are very good lawyers.

00:45.909 --> 00:47.360
I want to help any way I can.

01:15.773 --> 01:18.391
Whatever you are doing,
Judy, you keep doing it.

01:18.475 --> 01:20.893
- Thanks, Hank.
- You got it.

01:23.197 --> 01:25.648
Ah. Take your hands off the salmon cone,

01:25.816 --> 01:27.033
Hank, and nobody gets hurt.

01:27.151 --> 01:29.569
I am not going hungry into
limbal stem cell graft surgery.

01:29.703 --> 01:31.454
That's a mouthful.

01:31.572 --> 01:32.822
Yeah, it is,

01:32.990 --> 01:35.241
and you know I have to fast
for 12 hours before my surgery.

01:35.376 --> 01:36.909
Yeah, right. Nice try.

01:37.044 --> 01:38.411
Your surgery's not for two days,

01:38.545 --> 01:41.998
I know that's how you really
eat, and I really like it.

01:42.132 --> 01:43.883
Mm. And I really like that.

01:44.001 --> 01:46.753
Mm.

01:46.837 --> 01:49.472
- God, the salmon cones are good.
- Mm, right?

01:49.590 --> 01:51.224
Listen, the first surgery is simple, okay?

01:51.341 --> 01:52.809
Just some stem cell scaffolding

01:52.926 --> 01:55.178
to prepare for the corneal transplant later.

01:55.262 --> 01:56.846
Hank, please, no more medical talk.

01:56.980 --> 01:58.598
I just want to enjoy my salmon cone

01:58.732 --> 02:01.067
and my lobster roll and my ahi slider.

02:01.185 --> 02:02.769
What goes better with
seafood than medical talk?

02:02.853 --> 02:06.155
And you need to enjoy
Hanklab's successful opening.

02:06.273 --> 02:08.441
Oh, yeah? What makes you say it's a success?

02:08.525 --> 02:11.494
Well, listen, you hear
everyone having a good time?

02:13.447 --> 02:14.363
Hmm.

02:20.204 --> 02:21.621
- Henry.
- Ah.

02:21.755 --> 02:23.673
And all good things must come to an end.

02:23.791 --> 02:25.508
Let me guess. The importance
of hand washing demo.

02:25.626 --> 02:26.959
It's bringing down the house, right?

02:27.044 --> 02:29.378
Evan, it's a bowl of glitter.

02:29.513 --> 02:31.380
Why do you have to minimize my contribution?

02:31.465 --> 02:34.383
Hey, how about dinner
tonight, the four of us?

02:34.518 --> 02:36.552
We'd really like to get to
know you better, Charlotte.

02:36.687 --> 02:39.972
Now that you and Hank are...

02:40.107 --> 02:41.641
Charlotte and Hank.

02:41.775 --> 02:44.727
Ah, you know what?
Charlotte and Hank have plans.

02:44.895 --> 02:46.195
- Sorry.
- Right.

02:46.313 --> 02:47.396
It's totally my fault.

02:47.531 --> 02:49.282
I completely spoiled my appetite.

02:49.399 --> 02:50.900
Don't get too excited, but I think

02:51.068 --> 02:53.069
- I smell bacon-wrapped dates.
- Mmm.

02:53.237 --> 02:55.071
Come on.

02:58.158 --> 02:59.909
Okay, you know we just got denied

03:00.077 --> 03:01.878
'cause their plan is to have sex, right?

03:01.995 --> 03:04.413
Thanks for cracking that code.

03:06.609 --> 03:08.209
Oh, check this one out.

03:08.609 --> 03:10.887
- Hi.
- Hi. May I?

03:10.971 --> 03:13.089
Yeah.

03:13.173 --> 03:14.423
Ooh, no.

03:14.558 --> 03:17.560
There's something too,
uh, perfume-y about that.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.901
Oh, that I like.

03:25.018 --> 03:26.235
Ah.

03:26.353 --> 03:29.105
Okay, now, this one's not
as innocent as it seems.

03:29.189 --> 03:31.908
That is the note of Egyptian narcissus.

03:31.992 --> 03:33.693
It takes a while for it to appear,

03:33.827 --> 03:34.911
and then it grabs you.

03:35.028 --> 03:37.113
Wow. I just think it smells awesome.

03:37.247 --> 03:38.581
Well, if we were to create

03:38.699 --> 03:40.249
your own custom scent in my shop,

03:40.367 --> 03:43.002
I would make sure that
it had a sneaky quality.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.122
Sneaky, huh?

03:46.256 --> 03:48.124
There's a lot to learn about you, Emma who.

03:48.208 --> 03:50.042
Everyone has their own story,

03:50.127 --> 03:52.428
so they deserve their own unique scent.

03:52.513 --> 03:55.131
And that's my job... to figure
out what it is, blend it,

03:55.265 --> 03:56.349
and put it in a bottle.

03:56.466 --> 03:59.802
I match scent to sensibility.

03:59.937 --> 04:02.388
Oh. Sorry.

04:04.811 --> 04:07.618
__

04:07.618 --> 04:09.960
___

04:11.281 --> 04:13.032
Hey, you came.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.233
Hey.

04:14.368 --> 04:16.402
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Evan, Paige.

04:16.536 --> 04:18.237
- Yeah, this is really sweet.
- Yeah.

04:18.322 --> 04:19.622
Oh, I made you an awesome vine.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.324
- I'll email it to you.
- Oh, great.

04:21.408 --> 04:22.542
A vine? What's that?

04:22.659 --> 04:24.210
It's an animated gif.

04:24.328 --> 04:25.878
Oh, right. Like... yeah, like a cartoon.

04:25.996 --> 04:26.963
- Of course.
- No.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.331
Hmm? Huh?

04:28.465 --> 04:30.249
Well, this looks like
it's been a huge success,

04:30.384 --> 04:32.134
- but we actually have to bail.
- What? Already?

04:32.252 --> 04:33.245
Yeah, we're meeting friends at the beach,

04:33.245 --> 04:34.706
and then we're going to Raw Bar for dinner.

04:34.706 --> 04:36.483
Emma's never had lobster before.

04:36.514 --> 04:37.924
That ends tonight.

04:38.058 --> 04:39.308
Raw Bar? Is that new?

04:39.426 --> 04:41.761
Uh, no. It's been around for a couple weeks.

04:41.895 --> 04:43.179
"Weeks"? How did I not know that?

04:43.347 --> 04:44.513
I always know that kind of stuff.

04:44.681 --> 04:46.349
Well, you've had other priorities, Evan,

04:46.433 --> 04:48.234
like opening up a new business.

04:48.352 --> 04:49.769
Right.

04:49.903 --> 04:52.738
Well, uh, why don't we come
with you, like a double date?

04:52.856 --> 04:54.190
- How much fun would that be?
- Great.

04:54.358 --> 04:56.075
Uh, it's not a date. We're just hanging out.

04:56.193 --> 04:58.744
I think it kind of might be a date.

04:58.862 --> 05:00.663
Yeah, you guys should definitely come.

05:00.781 --> 05:02.040
Okay, great.

05:03.617 --> 05:04.700
All right.

05:04.868 --> 05:08.871
Just, uh, text me the deets.

05:09.006 --> 05:10.923
- They still say that, right?
- They do.

05:11.041 --> 05:12.792
You don't.

05:16.096 --> 05:18.130
You're leaving before the big unveiling?

05:18.265 --> 05:20.099
- Uh, I have an appointment.
- I thought we weren't

05:20.217 --> 05:22.101
scheduling patients
during the grand opening.

05:22.219 --> 05:23.803
Uh, we didn't.

05:23.937 --> 05:25.721
Is this something to do
with that private matter

05:25.889 --> 05:28.190
- that you had the other day?
- No.

05:28.308 --> 05:31.394
I saw you the other night
with a woman on the street.

05:31.561 --> 05:34.363
Oh. Well, then... you know...

05:34.481 --> 05:37.650
Her name is Viviana.

05:37.784 --> 05:40.486
Jeremiah...

05:40.621 --> 05:42.121
How did you meet her?

05:42.239 --> 05:44.206
At the Summer House. She's a bartender.

05:44.324 --> 05:47.043
Oh. I'd love to hear more about her.

05:47.127 --> 05:49.328
Sorry. I-I can't be late.

05:55.052 --> 05:56.419
All right, guys.

05:56.586 --> 05:57.920
Hi.

05:58.088 --> 05:59.255
Are you ready?

05:59.423 --> 06:01.257
- Yeah.
- Couldn't hear that at all.

06:01.341 --> 06:02.642
I said, "are you ready?"

06:02.759 --> 06:04.677
Yeah!

06:04.761 --> 06:05.678
Yeah!

06:05.812 --> 06:08.514
So, before I do this,

06:08.598 --> 06:12.018
I want to thank the
people responsible for it,

06:12.102 --> 06:13.936
uh, and that's you guys.

06:14.104 --> 06:15.354
It's this community.

06:15.489 --> 06:17.323
Without you, Hankmed wouldn't even exist.

06:17.441 --> 06:19.492
So, thank you.

06:19.609 --> 06:21.944
Thank you so much, and
thanks for being here.

06:22.079 --> 06:24.030
- Uh... and...
- Okay, I think we're good.

06:24.114 --> 06:25.364
I'll stop talking now.

06:25.449 --> 06:27.533
This is a moment you've
all been waiting for.

06:27.668 --> 06:32.038
Ladies and gentlemen,
Hanklab is officially open!

06:39.463 --> 06:41.097
- Congrats, Evan.
- Thanks.

06:41.214 --> 06:43.549
You figured out what Hankmed
needed, and you got it done.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.468
I mean, this lab is so impressive.

06:45.602 --> 06:47.186
Were you ever really worried, though?

06:47.304 --> 06:50.056
About shuttling patients all
the way out to Riverhead,

06:50.190 --> 06:52.058
messengering lab results?

06:52.192 --> 06:54.310
Yeah, I was a little worried.

06:54.478 --> 06:56.562
To be honest, so was I.

06:58.281 --> 07:00.316
Guys, to Hanklab.

07:00.450 --> 07:02.485
To Hanklab.

07:04.821 --> 07:06.872
Ah.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.491
Hey. Hey.

07:08.625 --> 07:09.867
Hey.

07:11.828 --> 07:13.702
Looks like we opened just in time.

07:29.009 --> 07:30.361
Lavender.

07:33.296 --> 07:35.297
Glass bottle with label...

07:35.465 --> 07:36.632
Tuberose.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.184
That is so cool.

07:38.301 --> 07:40.886
It's a lifesaver, especially
when getting dressed.

07:41.021 --> 07:43.189
I own a pair of boots
in both black and brown.

07:43.306 --> 07:45.641
It saves me from ending
up with black on the right

07:45.809 --> 07:47.977
and brown on the left.

07:48.111 --> 07:51.781
So, Sam, that was quite a fall
you had earlier. What happened?

07:51.898 --> 07:53.983
I was rushing to bring
out samples for my booth,

07:54.067 --> 07:58.037
and I stumbled, fell, and broke
a crapload of perfume bottles.

07:58.155 --> 08:00.239
At least the streets smell good.

08:00.373 --> 08:02.658
Uh, so this is a great store you have here.

08:02.793 --> 08:04.577
Thanks. I love it,

08:04.711 --> 08:07.463
but business isn't as brisk as
it normally is during the summer.

08:07.581 --> 08:09.131
I have no idea why.

08:09.216 --> 08:12.168
I'm running myself ragged
trying to get people in the door.

08:12.302 --> 08:13.719
No, there's nothing more exhausting

08:13.837 --> 08:15.971
than starting your own business.

08:16.056 --> 08:18.340
What got you interested in perfume?

08:18.475 --> 08:20.142
Mm.

08:20.260 --> 08:23.395
Well, my earliest memories are olfactive...

08:23.513 --> 08:26.816
The smell of wet dirt when
I would help my mom garden,

08:26.900 --> 08:30.402
the aftershave my father would
wear when he went to work,

08:30.520 --> 08:32.905
the brewery he smelled
like when he came home.

08:33.023 --> 08:34.356
Oh.

08:34.491 --> 08:35.357
He worked at a brewery.

08:35.491 --> 08:37.109
- Oh, makes sense.
- Of course.

08:37.193 --> 08:41.947
I was so aware of how certain
smells just made me feel.

08:42.032 --> 08:43.198
I know what you mean.

08:43.366 --> 08:44.834
When I'm away from my home in California,

08:44.951 --> 08:46.252
I miss the redwoods.

08:46.369 --> 08:49.538
- Wait till you smell 'em, Hank.
- I can't wait.

08:49.673 --> 08:51.173
What about you?

08:51.291 --> 08:53.342
Any scents that bring back memories?

08:53.460 --> 08:54.710
Vetiver.

08:54.878 --> 08:56.679
It reminds me of the south of France.

09:09.192 --> 09:10.559
Here we go.

09:10.644 --> 09:14.897
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:15.065 --> 09:16.899
What's the point of coming
to dinner with friends

09:17.067 --> 09:18.534
so you can be on your phone the whole time?

09:18.652 --> 09:20.619
It's kind of rude, right?

09:20.737 --> 09:22.705
Wow. That was fast.

09:22.822 --> 09:24.623
Your usual, Cinco. Enjoy.

09:24.741 --> 09:26.375
Thank you.

09:26.459 --> 09:27.793
"Your usual"?

09:27.911 --> 09:29.712
I thought you said this place was brand-new.

09:29.796 --> 09:31.130
It is. The owner's great,

09:31.248 --> 09:33.249
but he sucks up to me like I'm my father.

09:33.383 --> 09:35.751
Sometimes I'm just like,
"dude, my dad's the V.I.P."

09:35.886 --> 09:37.386
But then I think, "hey, what's the use?"

09:37.504 --> 09:40.005
Because this shrimp is amazing.

09:40.140 --> 09:42.308
Right.

09:42.425 --> 09:44.593
Gosh, I am gonna make such a mess.

09:44.728 --> 09:48.097
No, just use your hands.
Here, this will help.

09:48.231 --> 09:49.431
- Oh.
- Here you go.

09:49.516 --> 09:51.934
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

09:52.102 --> 09:53.519
Do I look like a giant baby?

09:53.653 --> 09:57.489
A giant lobster-loving baby,
and a super-cute one.

09:57.607 --> 10:01.076
So, Cinco, um, what are
your plans after college?

10:01.194 --> 10:02.745
Disappointing my father.

10:02.862 --> 10:05.164
He's a Harvard man,

10:05.282 --> 10:06.999
so he expects me to do the same thing...

10:07.117 --> 10:08.667
Go to Wall Street.

10:08.785 --> 10:10.669
I want to study poli-sci, go to Berkeley.

10:10.787 --> 10:12.371
So that's what I'm gonna do.

10:12.505 --> 10:13.544
- Cool, right?
- Yeah.

10:13.597 --> 10:16.342
- Very cool. Berkeley.
- Yeah. Well, I'm glad we agree.

10:16.459 --> 10:19.809
Sometimes I think parents can get a little
too obsessed with their kids' lives.

10:22.015 --> 10:25.922
Um, there's a table full
of girls waving at you.

10:29.272 --> 10:30.550
I should go say hi.

10:30.603 --> 10:31.788
Excuse me.

10:32.976 --> 10:34.977
Why don't you come with?

10:35.145 --> 10:38.364
Oh. Okay.

10:39.950 --> 10:42.179
You look amazing. Come on.

10:42.848 --> 10:43.970
Be right back.

10:44.988 --> 10:46.121
Hello, ladies.

10:46.206 --> 10:48.290
He is so sweet to her.

10:48.375 --> 10:50.960
He what? Did you say,
"he sells weed to her"?

10:51.077 --> 10:52.161
No, I said, "he is so"...

10:52.245 --> 10:53.829
Did the music just get really loud in here?

10:53.997 --> 10:55.164
- I said, "he's"...
- Just text me.

10:55.332 --> 10:56.832
Just text me.

11:09.479 --> 11:12.731
- Hi. Are you Divya?
- I am.

11:12.899 --> 11:14.650
Paiggave me your card
and told me to come over.

11:14.768 --> 11:15.985
- I'm Lauren.
- Nice to meet you.

11:16.069 --> 11:17.019
How can I help?

11:17.153 --> 11:18.988
Well, I've had a cough for a few weeks.

11:19.105 --> 11:21.023
I thought it was a cold and
figured it would just go away,

11:21.107 --> 11:22.524
but I've reached my breaking point.

11:25.495 --> 11:26.612
Sorry. Excuse me.

11:26.746 --> 11:28.030
It's really bad for business

11:28.164 --> 11:29.748
for me to be hacking all over my clients.

11:29.866 --> 11:31.750
I can imagine. Let's start with your vitals.

11:31.868 --> 11:34.169
- Please, have a seat.
- Okay.

11:42.629 --> 11:45.130
How did you get Monet's Water
Lilies on your fingernails?

11:45.265 --> 11:46.382
Oh, I did it myself,

11:46.466 --> 11:48.767
one tiny brushstroke at a time.

11:48.885 --> 11:50.052
I'm a nail artist.

11:50.186 --> 11:54.189
You are an artist. Very impressive.

11:54.307 --> 11:57.943
Although, sometimes I feel
more like a bartender.

11:58.061 --> 11:59.395
A bartender...

11:59.562 --> 12:00.612
How's that?

12:00.730 --> 12:02.364
People open right up the minute their nails

12:02.482 --> 12:04.107
are soaking in a bowl of water.

12:05.618 --> 12:08.037
Well, you must learn a lot about them.

12:08.121 --> 12:11.457
Oh, I learn everything about them.

12:14.577 --> 12:15.627
You do have a slight fever,

12:15.745 --> 12:17.463
but it's probably nothing to worry about.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.415
You may need a prescription
cough suppressant,

12:19.582 --> 12:21.300
but let me listen to your lungs first.

12:30.677 --> 12:32.644
Come in.

12:32.762 --> 12:35.064
We're open.

12:35.148 --> 12:36.815
What can I get for you?

12:36.933 --> 12:38.600
Iced tea, please.

12:38.735 --> 12:40.185
Iced tea.

12:44.274 --> 12:47.109
Is it usually so empty here?

12:47.243 --> 12:49.161
There is always at least one rush a day,

12:49.279 --> 12:52.831
and there are my regulars I depend on.

12:52.949 --> 12:55.951
Your regulars start to
become like friends, I guess.

12:56.086 --> 12:58.204
Only the good tippers.

13:00.507 --> 13:01.623
Living on tips...

13:01.791 --> 13:03.792
Must be rough.

13:03.927 --> 13:06.545
Do you find that you need
to work a second job?

13:06.679 --> 13:10.265
No. This is my only job.

13:10.383 --> 13:11.978
I'm sorry. Who are you?

13:12.886 --> 13:15.304
I'm a friend of Jeremiah's.

13:15.472 --> 13:18.690
Oh. Are you the immigration lawyer?

13:18.808 --> 13:20.559
Oh, Jeremiah has been a godsend.

13:20.693 --> 13:22.811
He said you think I have a good case.

13:22.896 --> 13:24.730
You're having immigration issues?

13:24.864 --> 13:28.233
Didn't Jeremiah explain?

13:28.368 --> 13:29.651
You're not an immigration lawyer.

13:29.786 --> 13:32.488
No, I'm not.

13:32.655 --> 13:35.040
Forget what I said.
It's... it's nothing, really.

13:35.158 --> 13:36.175
It's...

13:36.210 --> 13:37.955
a misunderstanding.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.164
Is it?

13:44.751 --> 13:46.802
Is it a misunderstanding?

13:46.886 --> 13:49.138
It sounds like Jeremiah hired you a lawyer.

13:49.255 --> 13:50.839
Would that be a problem?

13:50.974 --> 13:53.425
Only if he's being taken advantage of.

13:53.510 --> 13:54.927
That's what you think I'm doing?

13:55.061 --> 13:56.728
Honestly, I do not know what you are doing.

13:56.846 --> 13:59.431
No, you don't, but none
of it is your business.

13:59.566 --> 14:03.018
Jeremiah is my business, and
I think that you should know

14:03.102 --> 14:06.488
that I'll do whatever I
have to to protect him.

14:08.858 --> 14:11.610
Oh, please. Don't bother.

14:35.768 --> 14:36.894
Good morning.

14:39.188 --> 14:42.073
Hey, guys. There you are.

14:42.191 --> 14:43.692
- What did I miss?
- Oh, not much,

14:43.776 --> 14:45.744
just the staff meeting.

14:45.862 --> 14:47.362
Didn't you wear that yesterday?

14:47.497 --> 14:50.665
Hank Lawson, doing the walk of shame.

14:50.783 --> 14:52.667
- I love it.
- There's no shame.

14:52.785 --> 14:54.453
- Believe me, we've noticed.
- Oh, good.

14:54.587 --> 14:56.121
So where did Mr. PDA come from, anyway?

14:56.255 --> 14:57.372
Please don't call me that.

14:57.507 --> 14:58.526
Just tell me you have me covered tomorrow

14:58.526 --> 15:00.258
so I can take Charlotte to Manhattan.

15:00.376 --> 15:01.710
I have you covered.

15:01.878 --> 15:04.262
Do you need anything else
for your, uh, friend?

15:04.380 --> 15:05.964
Girlfriend? Lady companion?

15:06.098 --> 15:07.382
Paramour? What are we calling her?

15:07.517 --> 15:09.050
Uh, I'm calling her Charlotte.

15:09.218 --> 15:10.886
Okay, but whatever you call her,

15:11.020 --> 15:12.554
I just hope when she's
able to see you again,

15:12.722 --> 15:14.389
she doesn't take one look
at your face and bolt.

15:14.557 --> 15:16.224
Oh, good stuff, Ev.

15:16.359 --> 15:17.559
- Good stuff.
- Thanks a lot.

15:17.693 --> 15:18.610
Yeah.

15:18.728 --> 15:19.945
Oh, my God.

15:20.062 --> 15:24.533
What... guess who made the
front page of Snark Hampton?

15:24.650 --> 15:26.234
Us. Ha ha ha.

15:26.369 --> 15:27.869
- It's so cool.
- Congratulations.

15:27.954 --> 15:30.288
I'm gonna go shower now and just
wash all the excitement off me.

15:30.406 --> 15:32.123
- Okay.
- Hey, we look good.

15:32.241 --> 15:33.492
I know.

15:33.626 --> 15:36.044
Oz called us "B.O.F.S."

15:36.128 --> 15:37.829
B.O.F. What is that?

15:37.964 --> 15:40.499
Behemoths of fashion.

15:40.633 --> 15:42.667
- Emma, what does B.O.F. mean?
- Yeah?

15:42.802 --> 15:47.589
Uh... uh... well, it means...

15:47.723 --> 15:49.841
"Boring old farts."

15:49.976 --> 15:52.394
Oz is just being... being mean.

15:52.512 --> 15:54.062
It's just a stupid gossip website.

15:54.146 --> 15:56.932
Wait. "Boring old farts"?

15:57.099 --> 16:01.403
That's... look, I was up
till 1:00 A.M. last night.

16:01.521 --> 16:02.521
- You were?
- Yeah.

16:02.655 --> 16:05.740
- Doing what?
- Binge-watching NCIS.

16:07.410 --> 16:09.911
Okay, that aside, you are not old.

16:10.029 --> 16:11.413
30s are the new 20s, okay?

16:11.531 --> 16:14.950
Yeah, only people over
30 believe that, Paige.

16:15.034 --> 16:16.835
Screw you, Oz.

16:16.953 --> 16:18.453
Wait.

16:18.621 --> 16:20.589
Last week, you were Oz's it girl.

16:20.706 --> 16:23.458
- Now he's mean to you?
- Whatever.

16:23.593 --> 16:25.710
I mean, who knows? Who cares?

16:25.845 --> 16:27.879
Snark Hampton is so lame.

16:28.014 --> 16:30.966
Cinco thinks so too.

16:33.469 --> 16:36.093
__

16:49.068 --> 16:50.452
Good morning.

16:50.536 --> 16:52.737
I was just in the neighborhood,
and since we're neighbors,

16:52.872 --> 16:54.205
I thought I'd check on your dressing.

16:54.323 --> 16:55.907
Thanks, Hank. Uh, dressing's fine.

16:56.042 --> 16:57.409
I'll be... I'll be right with you.

16:57.493 --> 16:59.911
Okay.

17:00.046 --> 17:01.463
Huh. What's this?

17:01.581 --> 17:03.381
One of your customer's
wants to smell like grass?

17:03.499 --> 17:04.833
Oh, that's vanilla grass.

17:04.967 --> 17:07.502
That's actually been used
in perfume since the 1800s.

17:07.587 --> 17:10.672
That contains coumarin, which
is actually a very sweet scent.

17:10.806 --> 17:12.473
I also juice it for an afternoon pick-me-up.

17:12.592 --> 17:14.059
Just press and juice. You want some?

17:14.175 --> 17:15.844
Thank you, but I'm more of a coffee guy.

17:15.928 --> 17:17.512
Okay.

17:17.646 --> 17:19.848
I wanted to make something
custom for your friend Charlotte

17:19.932 --> 17:23.484
but my Malagasy supplier sent me a
defective shipment of ylang-ylang.

17:23.603 --> 17:26.771
- I hate it when that happens.
- It's so weak.

17:26.906 --> 17:28.607
Whoa.

17:28.691 --> 17:30.191
Uh, Sam, I'm no expert,

17:30.276 --> 17:32.994
but that smells like some pretty
strong ylang-ylang to me.

17:33.112 --> 17:34.863
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:34.997 --> 17:38.450
Hey, have you had a problem
smelling other scents today?

17:38.584 --> 17:40.502
Oh, I guess everything's
seemed a little off.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.370
You know what? I'd like
to do a quick nasal exam,

17:42.538 --> 17:44.706
make sure there aren't any obstructions.

17:52.798 --> 17:55.684
Okay.

17:55.801 --> 17:56.801
All right.

17:56.936 --> 17:59.437
No obstructions, swelling, or redness.

17:59.555 --> 18:02.057
You know what? I'd like to check
for diminished sense of smell.

18:02.191 --> 18:03.441
An odor evaluation?

18:03.559 --> 18:05.977
That's the main test to
get into perfumery school.

18:06.062 --> 18:08.897
Well, I can assure you
that is not why I'm here.

18:15.738 --> 18:18.073
Okay.

18:18.207 --> 18:20.992
Here we go.

18:21.127 --> 18:22.293
Try this.

18:22.411 --> 18:24.496
- Vanilla.
- No.

18:24.630 --> 18:27.039
- Uh, sandalwood.
- Nope.

18:28.918 --> 18:30.835
- Can you tell what that is?
- I-no.

18:30.970 --> 18:31.836
No.

18:31.921 --> 18:33.638
Okay, last one.

18:33.756 --> 18:36.224
- Vanilla.
- No.

18:36.308 --> 18:37.976
What's wrong with me?

18:38.094 --> 18:39.811
Listen, I want you to
come to the Hanklab today

18:39.929 --> 18:42.564
so I can do a nasoscope and head C.T.

18:42.682 --> 18:44.516
Hyposmia, or a decrease in smell,

18:44.650 --> 18:46.151
can be caused by a variety of things,

18:46.268 --> 18:48.937
but your ability to smell
is linked to your brain,

18:49.105 --> 18:51.022
and I want to see what's going on in there.

18:55.277 --> 18:59.030
Lorena, Sashi will look adorable in this.

18:59.165 --> 19:00.615
Did you knit it yourself?

19:00.750 --> 19:01.950
Yes, I did.

19:02.118 --> 19:05.286
I used to knit and embroider
all of Rafa's clothes

19:05.421 --> 19:06.838
when he was little.

19:06.956 --> 19:08.206
That was his.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.091
Well, I'll make sure to take
a picture of Sashi in it

19:10.209 --> 19:11.509
and send it to you.

19:11.627 --> 19:15.046
You two will do better than
that and come to visit me soon,

19:15.181 --> 19:17.432
maybe before she outgrows it.

19:17.550 --> 19:21.720
Skyping is wonderful, but
I want to hold my nieta.

19:21.854 --> 19:23.938
I'll make sure that we visit
by the end of the year.

19:24.023 --> 19:26.307
Sooner would be better,mi'ja.

19:26.442 --> 19:27.642
Adios.

19:27.810 --> 19:29.277
Hi. It's Jeremiah.

19:29.395 --> 19:31.362
I don't know if you're getting my messages,

19:31.480 --> 19:33.281
but, uh, will you give
me a call back, please?

19:33.399 --> 19:35.817
I-I have some news for you.

19:35.985 --> 19:38.119
Jeremiah.

19:38.204 --> 19:40.205
Sorry.

19:40.322 --> 19:41.623
Can I talk to you?

19:49.331 --> 19:51.332
I'm worried about you.

19:51.467 --> 19:52.884
Why are you worried about me?

19:53.002 --> 19:56.171
I feel like I don't see you
that much anymore, and I...

19:56.305 --> 19:57.889
Divya?

19:58.007 --> 19:59.224
I'm sorry to interrupt.

19:59.341 --> 20:00.809
Um, something's wrong.

20:00.926 --> 20:02.894
I have this massive
headache, I'm burning up,

20:03.012 --> 20:04.512
and I can hardly move my neck.

20:04.647 --> 20:05.997
Okay, Lauren, this is Dr. Sacani.

20:06.132 --> 20:07.832
Let's see what's going on.

20:13.556 --> 20:14.506
101.6.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.458
When I saw her yesterday, it was 99.6.

20:16.592 --> 20:18.276
I'm just gonna bend your head forward.

20:18.410 --> 20:20.028
Ow.

20:20.162 --> 20:22.947
Sorry. Um, that stiffness
in your neck in addition to

20:23.032 --> 20:24.949
the flu like symptoms
could mean meningitis.

20:25.084 --> 20:27.168
I think we should do a
lumbar puncture right now.

20:36.629 --> 20:37.929
Okay, the spinal fluid looks clear,

20:38.047 --> 20:40.181
which means it's probably
not bacterial meningitis,

20:40.299 --> 20:42.050
but it could still be viral meningitis.

20:42.184 --> 20:43.885
A girl in my pilates class had meningitis.

20:44.053 --> 20:45.687
Could I have gotten it from her?

20:45.771 --> 20:49.274
Oh, we don't even know if it is meningitis.

20:49.391 --> 20:53.228
So what brought you to nail art?

20:53.362 --> 20:55.530
I went to art school during the recession.

20:55.648 --> 20:57.899
When I graduated, nobody was buying art.

20:58.033 --> 20:59.901
It's not a necessity.

21:00.035 --> 21:03.288
But I realized, for many,
getting a weekly manicure is,

21:03.405 --> 21:04.739
especially in the Hamptons.

21:04.874 --> 21:07.575
So that's when I realized
I'd still be an artist.

21:07.710 --> 21:09.460
I just needed to change my canvas.

21:09.578 --> 21:10.879
That's very smart.

21:10.963 --> 21:13.631
Now I think sitting in a room
creating something alone all day

21:13.749 --> 21:15.216
would be really lonely.

21:15.334 --> 21:17.418
While we try to determine
what's causing your symptoms,

21:17.586 --> 21:19.721
I'm going to give you a
broad-spectrum antibiotic.

21:19.839 --> 21:21.673
And you need to go straight home and rest.

21:21.807 --> 21:23.341
I'll check on you in a couple of hours.

21:23.475 --> 21:24.592
No, no, no, I can't.

21:24.727 --> 21:25.760
I've been hired to do nails

21:25.895 --> 21:27.645
at the Mendelsohn Bat Mitzvah tonight.

21:27.763 --> 21:28.763
Posting cool nails on Instagram

21:28.898 --> 21:31.232
is everything to a 12-year-old girl.

21:33.769 --> 21:34.936
If you don't get better,

21:35.070 --> 21:37.822
you're gonna miss more than one Bat Mitzvah.

21:42.328 --> 21:46.781
All right, Paige...

21:46.866 --> 21:47.866
Please.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.200
Look, I'll make it,

21:49.335 --> 21:51.369
but I guarantee you're gonna
have heartburn tomorrow.

21:51.503 --> 21:52.837
That was one time, okay?

21:52.955 --> 21:54.839
And your mac and cheese
is really, really, cheesy.

21:54.957 --> 21:56.457
I mean, it's... look at that.

21:56.592 --> 22:00.595
There's, like, two pounds of...
I mean, in a good way.

22:00.713 --> 22:02.630
What are we doing?

22:02.798 --> 22:04.682
Stop.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.634
We need to go do something.

22:06.802 --> 22:08.803
We should be out doing something.

22:08.971 --> 22:10.972
Let's go find a rooftop
bar and have a cocktail.

22:11.106 --> 22:13.191
All right, we could go to Red Stixs.

22:13.309 --> 22:14.475
Are you kidding?

22:14.610 --> 22:16.311
Red Stixs is a band.

22:16.478 --> 22:17.395
No.

22:17.529 --> 22:19.781
Yes, it is. It's a...

22:19.899 --> 22:22.150
No. It's really not.

22:22.284 --> 22:23.818
I thought it was a band.

22:23.953 --> 22:25.536
See, that's what I'm talking about.

22:25.654 --> 22:27.240
Oh.

22:28.324 --> 22:30.408
I feel like I can't keep up, Paige.

22:30.492 --> 22:32.577
- What's wrong?
- I just learned

22:32.661 --> 22:34.996
how to perfectly express
myself in 140 characters.

22:35.130 --> 22:37.832
Now I have to condense
everything into a 7-second...

22:37.967 --> 22:40.385
- What is it called... "vine"?
- No, Evan, you don't.

22:40.502 --> 22:41.920
At least not with me.

22:42.004 --> 22:45.673
I just feel old and...

22:45.808 --> 22:48.092
I feel old.

22:48.227 --> 22:50.228
I've never felt that before.

22:50.346 --> 22:53.731
I feel like everything's
moving really, really fast.

22:53.849 --> 22:56.184
Like, I think about the good old
days... like, the good old days,

22:56.268 --> 22:59.437
when I still felt young
and carefree and current.

22:59.571 --> 23:02.523
And that was last summer.

23:02.658 --> 23:06.861
Evan, we're living the good old days.

23:06.996 --> 23:10.498
Look, you've grown up so
much since I've met you.

23:10.616 --> 23:13.918
You've accomplished so much.

23:14.036 --> 23:16.287
I love that young, carefree kid,

23:16.422 --> 23:21.009
but I'm also pretty crazy about
the mature, sensible Evan.

23:21.093 --> 23:23.544
- So you don't feel old?
- Not at all.

23:23.679 --> 23:26.180
I feel happy.

23:37.726 --> 23:39.894
Sam, you didn't show up for your tests.

23:40.062 --> 23:41.946
- What happened?
- Sorry. I got busy.

23:42.064 --> 23:45.066
Heidi and I are trying to
refine her signature scent.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.569
The orange blossoms aren't grabbing
me the way they normally do.

23:48.737 --> 23:52.073
Oh, Sam concocted "Summer
in a Bottle" for me.

23:52.241 --> 23:54.042
It reminds me of being a kid

23:54.159 --> 23:56.411
and spending time at the
beach with my family.

23:56.495 --> 23:57.912
Oh, we'll get it right, okay?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.081
Don't worry. I'll call
you when it's finished.

24:00.215 --> 24:02.216
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you, Sam.

24:10.309 --> 24:11.426
Sam?

24:11.593 --> 24:13.011
This morning your hands were fine.

24:13.145 --> 24:15.430
Now you're shaking and
having trouble holding bottles.

24:15.564 --> 24:17.231
Has this happened before?

24:17.349 --> 24:20.101
My hands get extremely clumsy

24:20.269 --> 24:23.104
by the end of the day every day.

24:23.272 --> 24:24.155
And it's not just my hands.

24:24.273 --> 24:27.942
My whole body just feels so weak,

24:28.077 --> 24:29.944
and...

24:30.112 --> 24:32.246
Even my breathing... It's hard to breathe.

24:32.331 --> 24:33.865
Okay, do you have any pain?

24:36.785 --> 24:39.921
Sam, the vanilla grass you
drink every afternoon...

24:40.039 --> 24:42.173
Did you have it today?

24:42.291 --> 24:44.375
Okay, let's get you to the
lab. I want to run a test.

24:44.510 --> 24:46.627
Sam! Sam!

24:50.037 --> 24:51.705
What makes you think it's myasthenia gravis?

24:51.872 --> 24:53.840
Sam's recently experienced
a diminished sense of smell.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.709
He's had muscle weakness late in the day,

24:55.843 --> 24:57.677
but he's also been drinking
a shot of vanilla grass

24:57.795 --> 24:59.129
every afternoon until today.

24:59.263 --> 25:01.264
And the grass was masking
the neuromuscular effect.

25:01.382 --> 25:03.850
Exactly. This tensolin
should help right away.

25:11.142 --> 25:13.727
I feel so much better.

25:13.861 --> 25:18.315
Sam, I need you start
counting backwards from 100.

25:18.449 --> 25:22.986
100, 99, 98, 97...

25:23.070 --> 25:24.654
We're testing your repetitive movement

25:24.789 --> 25:25.739
of your diaphragm muscles.

25:25.873 --> 25:29.626
95, 94, 93, 92...

25:29.744 --> 25:31.828
- His voice is weakening.
- 91...

25:31.912 --> 25:34.914
Unfortunately, the improvement you felt
from the tensolin's only temporary.

25:35.049 --> 25:36.800
The medication will wear
off in about 20 minutes.

25:36.917 --> 25:38.918
At which point you might not
be able to breathe again.

25:39.086 --> 25:41.054
We need to get you to the hospital.

25:53.567 --> 25:56.603
I'm sorry Cinco hasn't
answered any of your texts.

25:56.771 --> 25:57.821
Maybe he hasn't seen them.

25:57.938 --> 26:01.491
Oh, he has definitely seen them.

26:01.609 --> 26:03.109
Whatever. I mean, it's
not like we were dating.

26:03.244 --> 26:04.494
We were just hanging out.

26:04.612 --> 26:06.413
You know, I don't even know
why I'm that surprised.

26:06.497 --> 26:09.749
I didn't expect him to stick around anyways.

26:09.867 --> 26:12.952
So maybe Cinco's not as
wonderful as you thought.

26:13.087 --> 26:14.954
Yeah, definitely not.

26:15.039 --> 26:19.693
He is just like the rest of the
rich, entitled jerks out here.

26:21.962 --> 26:24.180
Okay, I'm gonna fix us some food,

26:24.298 --> 26:25.799
and then we can talk some more.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.634
There's nothing else to talk about.

26:27.802 --> 26:30.387
Cinco is over me, and I'm over him.

26:37.672 --> 26:39.312
Wow.

26:39.447 --> 26:40.980
She got over that fast.

26:41.148 --> 26:43.199
Are you kidding? She's so upset.

26:43.317 --> 26:45.285
She just puts on a brave face.

26:50.477 --> 26:52.202
Well, it makes sense.

26:52.382 --> 26:54.728
She's had to take care of herself
since she was a little kid.

26:54.920 --> 26:55.784
Yeah.

26:55.819 --> 26:58.331
When I was her age, I was crying
and listening to Leann Rimes.

26:59.359 --> 27:00.794
Me too.

27:03.554 --> 27:05.972
Should I get those tums?

27:06.090 --> 27:07.390
Yeah.

27:15.102 --> 27:16.569
__

27:27.661 --> 27:29.529
Is... is everything all right?

27:29.663 --> 27:31.948
You didn't answer any of my calls.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.616
I have news.

27:36.420 --> 27:38.288
Come.

27:47.264 --> 27:49.632
My lawyer friend says you
have a very strong case.

27:49.767 --> 27:51.009
Jeremiah.

27:51.009 --> 27:53.303
Even though you left the
country last year before

27:53.437 --> 27:55.792
the travel documents were approved,
your grandmother was ill.

27:55.792 --> 27:57.390
He says that falls within the exceptions.

27:57.525 --> 28:01.027
Yes, you weren't born here,
but, um, you were raised here,

28:01.145 --> 28:04.314
and this is your home.

28:04.448 --> 28:06.366
Thank you, Jeremiah,

28:06.484 --> 28:08.902
but I'm in good hands with legal aid.

28:09.069 --> 28:10.737
I don't want to complicate things further

28:10.871 --> 28:12.205
by having a different attorney,

28:12.323 --> 28:15.125
and honestly, I can't afford
to lose any more work.

28:15.242 --> 28:17.327
Viviana, you could be deported.

28:17.461 --> 28:19.796
I know.

28:19.914 --> 28:23.082
I can't raise any red flags right now,

28:23.250 --> 28:24.467
especially at my work.

28:24.585 --> 28:26.085
Right, but that's why I want to help you.

28:26.220 --> 28:27.754
I need to be careful.

28:27.888 --> 28:29.589
There's a lot depending on this year,

28:29.757 --> 28:31.925
and I can't afford to make
any enemies right now.

28:32.059 --> 28:35.311
W-what do you mean?

28:35.429 --> 28:39.265
- I could never be your enemy.
- No, not you.

28:39.433 --> 28:41.768
If you really want to help me,

28:41.936 --> 28:44.354
please just go away.

29:02.423 --> 29:04.958
I'm sure Charlotte's
procedure will go smoothly.

29:06.460 --> 29:09.295
Thank you.

29:09.430 --> 29:13.633
I spoke to her ophthalmologist
and to her rheumatologist.

29:13.767 --> 29:15.969
She's in very good hands.

29:16.136 --> 29:18.471
Ah.

29:18.639 --> 29:21.724
You really care about her.

29:21.809 --> 29:23.893
I do.

29:24.028 --> 29:26.479
I didn't know how much
until she showed up here,

29:26.614 --> 29:29.065
but now we've had the chance
to spend all this time together.

29:29.149 --> 29:31.618
It's just been... It's been amazing.

29:31.735 --> 29:35.038
I mean, she's... she's amazing.

29:36.657 --> 29:39.742
It's nice to see you so happy.

29:39.877 --> 29:41.661
I see why you're so crazy about her.

29:41.795 --> 29:45.164
I mean, she's beautiful, smart,

29:45.249 --> 29:47.550
- and so easy to talk to.
- She is.

29:47.668 --> 29:50.003
She's all those things,
especially the last one.

29:50.137 --> 29:51.671
There's nothing like a good listener...

29:51.839 --> 29:53.289
Mm.

29:53.507 --> 29:56.593
Someone who will listen to all of your
problems and not judge you for them,

29:56.727 --> 30:00.096
someone who will share their own right back.

30:00.231 --> 30:02.398
You're lucky.

30:02.516 --> 30:04.851
What?

30:06.820 --> 30:09.606
Do you think Jeremiah will ever have that?

30:09.740 --> 30:11.824
Have what?

30:11.942 --> 30:15.161
Someone special. I think he's lonely.

30:15.279 --> 30:17.030
Oh, I think he'll find someone.

30:17.197 --> 30:18.364
You know how it is.

30:18.532 --> 30:22.368
It's always the person you least expect.

30:24.171 --> 30:26.289
- What is that?
- I have no idea.

30:26.423 --> 30:28.925
Doesn't sound good.

30:34.548 --> 30:36.516
Get out of the way!

30:45.859 --> 30:49.028
Hey. Excuse me, I'm a doctor.

30:49.146 --> 30:51.064
Okay. Thank you.

30:52.816 --> 30:55.318
Hank, this is my patient Lauren.

30:55.452 --> 30:57.487
Lauren, I'm Hank. Are you okay?

30:57.621 --> 30:58.621
I've been better.

30:58.739 --> 31:01.074
- Does your neck hurt?
- No, it's fine.

31:01.208 --> 31:04.327
Okay, can you move your
hands and wiggle your toes.

31:04.461 --> 31:05.662
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

31:05.796 --> 31:08.047
Stabilize the neck. Let's log roll her.

31:08.165 --> 31:10.416
Okay, easy.

31:10.584 --> 31:13.720
Everything is spinning.

31:13.804 --> 31:14.921
Okay.

31:15.089 --> 31:16.422
- Does any of this hurt?
- No.

31:16.557 --> 31:18.591
Okay. No tenderness.

31:18.726 --> 31:19.926
Besides cuts and scrapes,

31:20.060 --> 31:22.645
there doesn't appear to
be any serious injuries.

31:22.763 --> 31:26.983
Hank, there are splinter
hemorrhages on Lauren's real nails.

31:29.019 --> 31:30.937
What? What's wrong with my head?

31:31.071 --> 31:32.822
Why am I so dizzy?

31:32.940 --> 31:34.407
It's not your head. It's your heart.

31:40.092 --> 31:41.376
B.P. 100.

31:41.511 --> 31:43.916
Okay, Lauren, I want you to
look directly into my eyes.

31:45.848 --> 31:48.383
She can't keep her eyes focused on me.

31:53.222 --> 31:54.677
Normal.

31:59.145 --> 32:00.695
No bleeding.

32:00.780 --> 32:03.448
She's having an ischemic stroke.

32:03.566 --> 32:04.783
We need to remove the blockage

32:04.901 --> 32:06.284
before it causes permanent damage.

32:06.402 --> 32:08.453
Let's start permissive
hypertension immediately.

32:08.571 --> 32:10.238
We're gonna give you medication to increase

32:10.406 --> 32:14.242
your blood pressure to try
to force the clot out, okay?

32:21.801 --> 32:23.718
This should work.

32:31.177 --> 32:33.478
I want to get her systolic B.P. up to 160.

32:33.596 --> 32:35.180
- What's she at now?
- 108.

32:35.314 --> 32:39.401
Okay, Lauren, the splinter hemorrhages on
your fingernails indicate endocarditis.

32:39.519 --> 32:41.603
It's an infection of the
inner lining of your heart.

32:41.737 --> 32:43.772
- Now?
- 123.

32:43.856 --> 32:47.742
A piece of the infection
broke off and caused a stroke.

32:47.860 --> 32:49.778
160.

32:53.115 --> 32:54.866
Okay, it's working.

32:55.001 --> 32:56.835
Am I gonna be okay?

32:56.953 --> 32:58.753
We need to find the cause of the infection,

32:58.871 --> 33:01.256
but once we do and give you
the appropriate medications,

33:01.374 --> 33:03.625
you're gonna be fine.

33:15.972 --> 33:17.722
So you'll use topical antibiotics

33:17.857 --> 33:19.307
until the surface of the cornea is...

33:19.475 --> 33:20.942
Completely epithelialized.

33:21.027 --> 33:22.477
I've done the research. I know.

33:22.612 --> 33:25.063
Hank, please. It's an outpatient procedure.

33:25.197 --> 33:26.197
It takes less than an hour.

33:26.315 --> 33:28.149
I'll be back on my feet in two hours.

33:28.284 --> 33:29.901
I guess I'm more anxious than you are.

33:30.036 --> 33:31.403
Really? I hadn't noticed.

33:31.537 --> 33:33.321
I can take her from here, Dr. Lawson.

33:33.456 --> 33:36.408
So am I special,

33:36.492 --> 33:39.578
or do you treat all your patients like this?

33:39.662 --> 33:41.997
You're not my patient.

33:42.131 --> 33:43.806
Good answer.

33:45.718 --> 33:49.421
So you have any last-minute questions?

33:49.555 --> 33:50.672
Actually, I do.

33:50.806 --> 33:52.724
Yeah, tell me.

33:52.842 --> 33:54.593
Where are we going for lunch afterwards?

33:54.727 --> 33:57.646
'Cause I really want a
burger from Shake Shack.

33:57.763 --> 33:59.931
Okay, Dr. Lawson, it's time to go in now.

34:00.016 --> 34:01.516
Okay.

34:06.906 --> 34:09.274
I will be right here the entire time.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.618
Okay.

34:37.770 --> 34:39.888
There you are.

34:40.056 --> 34:44.059
I tried your cell a few times
to update you on Lauren.

34:44.193 --> 34:45.893
Where have you been?

34:48.364 --> 34:50.231
Uh, Viviana...

34:50.399 --> 34:53.318
The woman I told you about...

34:53.452 --> 34:56.202
She doesn't want to see me anymore.

34:58.324 --> 35:00.408
I-I don't know what went wrong.

35:02.912 --> 35:05.080
I'm so sorry, Jeremiah.

35:05.214 --> 35:08.083
I really liked Viviana...

35:08.250 --> 35:11.920
And I thought that she...

35:12.054 --> 35:13.755
that she liked me too.

35:20.012 --> 35:21.680
So I don't want it to be over.

35:24.066 --> 35:26.484
Sometimes these things
aren't meant to work out,

35:26.602 --> 35:28.937
as hard as that is to
believe at this moment.

35:29.071 --> 35:32.440
See, she... she was dealing with something,

35:32.608 --> 35:34.576
and...

35:34.694 --> 35:36.578
I was hoping to help her.

35:38.948 --> 35:42.917
See, I-I think somehow
that... that pushed her away.

35:51.711 --> 35:56.097
I went to Summer House, and I spoke to her.

35:59.852 --> 36:02.437
I was worried that you
were in over your head.

36:04.557 --> 36:05.774
I don't understand.

36:05.858 --> 36:07.058
I wanted to make sure

36:07.193 --> 36:09.227
that you weren't being taken advantage of.

36:12.531 --> 36:15.617
- You were worried about me.
- Yes.

36:18.204 --> 36:20.155
Why?

36:20.322 --> 36:22.991
Jeremiah, she got very defensive,

36:23.125 --> 36:27.212
which only confirmed my fears.

36:29.465 --> 36:32.050
That's why she was so upset.

36:35.921 --> 36:38.473
I've only ever looked out
for your best interests,

36:38.591 --> 36:41.309
Jeremiah, as a friend.

36:41.427 --> 36:44.846
You... you... you weren't
talking about it at all.

36:44.980 --> 36:48.066
I tried. I did, but...

36:48.184 --> 36:49.400
You wouldn't let me in,

36:49.518 --> 36:53.738
so I did what I felt I-I had to.

36:53.856 --> 36:56.741
I wanted to make sure that you would...

37:17.522 --> 37:19.346
Look at this.

37:20.356 --> 37:22.342
He's... he's riding a bike.

37:22.890 --> 37:24.210
How did they teach him how to do that?

37:24.257 --> 37:25.841
I don't know.

37:26.009 --> 37:28.427
I can't believe I've never
had baked Alaska before.

37:28.678 --> 37:30.012
Now I'm gonna, like, dream about it.

37:30.313 --> 37:31.730
I can't believe you thought it was fish.

37:32.015 --> 37:33.899
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey.

37:34.184 --> 37:35.651
We just stopped by to say "hi",

37:35.902 --> 37:37.319
- and we brought some lunch.
- Oh, my gosh.

37:37.570 --> 37:39.238
Thank you so much, but we
already ate at the beach.

37:39.522 --> 37:42.279
And then Cinco took me to
Delmonico's for dessert,

37:42.316 --> 37:43.942
and now I think I'm on a sugar high.

37:44.194 --> 37:45.444
That sounds like a good day.

37:45.662 --> 37:47.529
Yeah, once you finally got
in touch with each other.

37:47.781 --> 37:49.581
Oh, yeah, Cinco's phone died on the boat,

37:49.783 --> 37:50.699
and he didn't have his charger,

37:50.917 --> 37:52.584
and that was why he didn't text me back.

37:52.869 --> 37:53.669
Oh.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.421
I came over right after we docked.

37:55.705 --> 37:56.872
Beats the hell out of a text.

37:57.123 --> 37:58.424
You know, we should actually
probably plug your phone in,

37:58.708 --> 37:59.925
because God knows how many people think

38:00.210 --> 38:01.710
that you're blowing them off.

38:01.878 --> 38:04.012
Great. Thanks for letting us know,

38:04.264 --> 38:05.097
and thanks for, uh, taking us

38:05.382 --> 38:06.432
on that emotional roller-coaster ride.

38:06.716 --> 38:07.633
That was a lot of fun.

38:07.884 --> 38:09.768
That time of life was exhausting.

38:10.053 --> 38:12.054
I'm so glad I'm not 17.

38:12.305 --> 38:14.556
I'm glad you're not 17 too.

38:19.396 --> 38:20.896
You know what?

38:21.064 --> 38:23.148
Screw the good old days.

38:23.366 --> 38:25.901
I'd take now over than any day.

38:27.871 --> 38:30.572
- To now.
- To now.

38:34.043 --> 38:36.245
Hmm.

38:36.496 --> 38:37.579
All right, I can't help it.

38:37.831 --> 38:40.249
I got to see what's on Snark Hampton.

38:43.219 --> 38:45.053
Oh.

38:45.305 --> 38:48.424
- Hey, Emma.
- Yeah?

38:48.675 --> 38:51.260
Yeah, you and Cinco might want to see this.

38:56.766 --> 38:59.651
Well, my butt looks great,

38:59.936 --> 39:03.405
and my friends are douches.

39:03.656 --> 39:06.074
I just can't believe that...

39:06.276 --> 39:08.477
Oh, God.

39:09.996 --> 39:12.781
Why would Oz want to make Hank look bad?

39:13.082 --> 39:15.784
Why would anyone?

39:22.509 --> 39:25.930
Are you sure your surgeon said it
was okay to be out running so soon?

39:25.930 --> 39:26.962
- Ask me again.
- I'm sorry.

39:27.263 --> 39:29.381
I'm sorry, but most people
would use surgery as an excuse

39:29.599 --> 39:30.966
to take a day off from running. Uh-oh.

39:31.267 --> 39:32.551
Blader coming down the middle. Go wide.

39:32.802 --> 39:33.936
Watch out.

39:34.187 --> 39:35.304
Nice one.

39:35.555 --> 39:38.023
Oh, and that was four miles.

39:38.308 --> 39:39.308
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:39.476 --> 39:40.392
That flew by.

39:40.643 --> 39:41.643
How do you feel?

39:41.945 --> 39:43.695
I'm glad I burned off that burger.

39:43.980 --> 39:45.314
Any pain?

39:45.532 --> 39:47.483
My eye is killing me, but my feet are fine.

39:47.650 --> 39:48.534
Well, in a day or two,

39:48.818 --> 39:50.486
the pain will wear off substantially.

39:50.737 --> 39:52.654
Here, have some water.

39:52.906 --> 39:55.741
You know, I'm really glad I'm doing this.

39:55.959 --> 39:57.826
I'm glad you're glad.

39:58.127 --> 40:01.046
When will you be back
for the second surgery?

40:01.331 --> 40:04.082
A couple weeks. I have some
business to sort out at home.

40:04.334 --> 40:06.134
Will you miss me?

40:06.336 --> 40:08.136
I already do.

40:08.388 --> 40:11.840
You know, I have an hour before
I have to head to the airport.

40:12.141 --> 40:13.809
What did you have in mind?

40:14.010 --> 40:15.477
Another loop?

40:15.728 --> 40:17.679
Yeah, right. Let's get out of here.

40:17.897 --> 40:20.482
Wait.

40:20.733 --> 40:22.901
Listen...

40:23.102 --> 40:25.020
Okay.

40:40.703 --> 40:43.422
Hey, hey. Yo, lady, what are you, blind?

40:43.540 --> 40:45.507
Yeah, I am, actually.

40:47.710 --> 40:50.379
I love this city.

40:50.547 --> 40:52.798
And I have never loved it more.

41:07.897 --> 41:09.865
Shh.

41:09.983 --> 41:12.534
Shh.

41:12.652 --> 41:15.037
Shh.

41:18.541 --> 41:21.410
Jeremiah, I am so glad that you are home.

41:21.544 --> 41:24.880
I have to talk to you.

41:24.998 --> 41:27.883
I am so sorry.

41:28.001 --> 41:31.670
I'm sorry that I went to see her.

41:31.804 --> 41:34.840
I am sorry that I hurt you.

41:34.974 --> 41:38.894
I-I didn't handle it well.

41:40.346 --> 41:44.232
I thought I was doing the right thing...

41:44.317 --> 41:46.685
The right thing for you.

41:48.488 --> 41:50.405
Okay.

41:53.526 --> 41:56.028
I need you to move out.

42:01.048 --> 42:05.715
