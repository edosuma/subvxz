[mellow music]

00:12.667 --> 00:14.958
(Garibaldi)
'Captain, I just thought
you should know.'

00:15.042 --> 00:16.625
They've got your dad, John.

00:16.708 --> 00:18.333
They traced him through
his medication, picked him up

00:18.417 --> 00:21.958
at a safe house two days ago
just outside of Chicago.

00:22.042 --> 00:23.750
Now look, we've got a couple
days before they can move

00:23.833 --> 00:25.750
on this and we should be
able to break him out.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.208
Now, I've got some
people who can help

00:27.292 --> 00:29.333
but they want a meeting.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.667
I mean it, John, I don't
like the way this sounds

00:31.750 --> 00:33.917
I don't like the way it looks,
I don't like anything about it.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.583
I mean, it stinks of a setup.

00:36.667 --> 00:39.167
(Garibaldi)
Michael and I have
had our problems lately

00:39.250 --> 00:40.833
but he has never
given me reason to think

00:40.917 --> 00:42.583
he meant me harm.

00:42.667 --> 00:45.042
Alright.

00:45.125 --> 00:47.625
What do you want me to do?

00:47.708 --> 00:49.292
You've already done it.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.208
It's a tranq.

00:52.292 --> 00:53.625
- 'Don't fight it.'
- What are you..

00:53.708 --> 00:56.083
Just give it up
or they're gonna hurt you.

01:04.417 --> 01:07.458
[intense music]

01:37.333 --> 01:40.625
Do you have any allergies or
illnesses I should be aware of?

01:42.208 --> 01:44.333
Are you currently
taking any medication?

01:45.750 --> 01:48.375
'Have you had any trouble
with your heart?'

01:51.917 --> 01:55.292
When I ask a question,
you will respond at once.

01:55.375 --> 01:59.500
You will not hesitate, you will
not consider, you will not lie.

01:59.583 --> 02:04.833
Cooperation will be rewarded.
Resistance will be punished.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.667
'Do you understand?'

02:10.917 --> 02:12.208
[electricity crackling]

02:12.292 --> 02:13.542
Aah!

02:17.500 --> 02:19.625
Pain givers.

02:19.708 --> 02:22.542
We bought them from the Narn
during the war.

02:23.792 --> 02:25.542
They're most effective.

02:25.625 --> 02:27.792
'If you come within three feet
of me, you will be hurt.'

02:27.875 --> 02:29.292
'If you come within two feet'

02:29.375 --> 02:32.333
'you will be
rendered unconscious.'

02:32.417 --> 02:35.250
Well, there's nothing to be
gained by trying to harm me.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.250
I am not the enemy.

02:38.333 --> 02:40.542
To be the enemy,
I must have some personal stake

02:40.625 --> 02:43.083
in what happens to you.

02:43.167 --> 02:45.375
'I'm not interested
in that at all.'

02:45.458 --> 02:47.958
I'm here to do a job,
nothing more.

02:48.042 --> 02:52.792
You are a name,
a file and a case number.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.625
That is all.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.042
Aah!

02:57.583 --> 02:59.458
I have no desire to inflict pain

02:59.542 --> 03:04.125
but I will do so when
and as it is required.

03:04.208 --> 03:06.250
The level of discomfort
you experience

03:06.333 --> 03:08.667
will be entirely up to you.

03:08.750 --> 03:12.292
I'm not here to negotiate
or to assist you.

03:12.375 --> 03:14.458
Then why are you here?

03:14.542 --> 03:17.583
To ensure your cooperation.

03:17.667 --> 03:22.583
To that end, I will use whatever
means I feel are appropriate.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.750
'Do you understand?'

03:38.875 --> 03:40.750
[grunting]

03:43.417 --> 03:45.042
No. No.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.583
[groans]

03:49.750 --> 03:51.333
[grunts]

03:53.375 --> 03:55.708
It was a simple enough question.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.625
There's no reason
to endure all this

03:57.708 --> 04:01.750
just to determine if you have
a grasp of English.

04:01.833 --> 04:05.417
So, do you understand?

04:10.875 --> 04:14.542
'Do you have any allergies or
illnesses I should be aware of?'

04:15.958 --> 04:18.000
Are you currently
taking any medication?

04:19.500 --> 04:21.667
Have you had any problems
with your heart?

04:23.875 --> 04:25.292
No.

04:26.708 --> 04:28.458
Good.

04:28.542 --> 04:32.292
Then...we can begin.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.833
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

04:41.917 --> 04:43.667
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.417
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.167
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.708
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

04:50.792 --> 04:52.083
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.875
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

04:53.958 --> 04:56.000
(Londo)
It was a new age.

04:56.083 --> 04:57.875
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.458
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.667
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.

05:05.750 --> 05:07.083
The place..

05:07.167 --> 05:08.708
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

05:08.792 --> 05:11.833
[theme music]

05:51.792 --> 05:54.875
[music continues]

06:05.833 --> 06:08.708
[intense music]

06:38.208 --> 06:39.750
Good morning.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.333
- Good morning.
- It's not morning.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.792
- It isn't?
- No.

06:46.875 --> 06:49.625
And how do you know that?

06:49.708 --> 06:52.542
When you came in before,
I saw daylight through the door.

06:54.458 --> 06:58.375
When you came in now,
it's...dark outside.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.125
Daylight?

07:03.542 --> 07:06.667
You mean, uh...that?

07:08.500 --> 07:13.625
Well, if that's daylight
and, uh, that's night

07:13.708 --> 07:18.500
then we may as well assume
that this is morning again.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.750
Good morning.

08:04.125 --> 08:07.125
I'd forget my head
if it wasn't nailed on.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.792
Which reminds me.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.458
[groans]

08:18.958 --> 08:21.375
Never contradict me.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.833
Mm-hm.. Hmm..

08:43.542 --> 08:44.708
'Hmm..'

08:58.458 --> 08:59.667
Mmm..

09:01.458 --> 09:04.625
Oh, my, look at the time.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.750
Mm..

09:13.250 --> 09:14.375
Mm..

09:17.208 --> 09:18.375
Mm..

09:22.375 --> 09:23.625
[sighs]

09:23.708 --> 09:24.875
Hmm..

09:27.708 --> 09:32.292
You know, this is interesting.
I hadn't seen this before.

09:32.375 --> 09:33.583
During your time at the academy

09:33.667 --> 09:35.958
'and all your years
during the war'

09:36.042 --> 09:38.625
afterwards you never showed any
particular interest

09:38.708 --> 09:41.250
in politics so..

09:44.208 --> 09:47.500
...you don't consider yourself
to be political?

09:47.583 --> 09:51.208
- No.
- That's interesting. Yes.

09:51.292 --> 09:52.625
That's very interesting.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.125
You see,
that's what they thought.

09:57.208 --> 09:58.625
'That's why you're here.'

09:58.708 --> 10:01.167
'If you never showed any
particular interest in politics'

10:01.250 --> 10:03.875
then it's not likely that
you'd start running around

10:03.958 --> 10:05.750
trying to overthrow
your own government

10:05.833 --> 10:10.667
unless you had been under
the influence of outsiders.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.833
'Is that a fair thing to say?'

10:12.917 --> 10:16.458
That, uh, you've been under
the influence of other people?

10:18.250 --> 10:21.458
- No.
- No. Really?

10:22.917 --> 10:25.042
I find that most remarkable.

10:25.125 --> 10:29.167
I mean, aren't we all
under the influence of others?

10:29.250 --> 10:30.958
It's part of being in the world.

10:31.042 --> 10:32.708
Somebody in the office
is in a bad mood

10:32.792 --> 10:34.958
pretty soon
everybody's in a bad mood.

10:35.042 --> 10:38.208
We're all
influenced by other people.

10:38.292 --> 10:41.125
You've really never been
influenced by anyone else?

10:44.833 --> 10:48.083
Are you that far removed
from other people?

10:51.125 --> 10:52.625
Well..

10:52.708 --> 10:53.917
...no matter.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.167
I'll put it down
as, uh, your first fabrication.

11:02.792 --> 11:07.375
Mmm, this is really
excellent corned beef.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.250
'Mm.'

11:09.333 --> 11:12.542
You have to get
just the right mustard.

11:12.625 --> 11:15.083
The brown with the seeds,
not the yellow kind

11:15.167 --> 11:17.417
and not too much of it.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.125
If there's too much, it, um

11:19.208 --> 11:21.833
irritates the corners
of my mouth.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.458
Mm.

11:25.542 --> 11:27.417
Oh, would, uh..

11:27.500 --> 11:29.208
...would you like some?

11:30.917 --> 11:32.625
I know they haven't fed you
since you got here.

11:32.708 --> 11:37.667
That's at least two days.
Besides it's lunchtime.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.833
Isn't it? Isn't it lunchtime?

11:44.917 --> 11:46.750
You-you just said
it was morning.

11:46.833 --> 11:49.125
Well, you can't have
a corned beef sandwich

11:49.208 --> 11:52.500
for breakfast.
It would upset your stomach.

11:52.583 --> 11:55.625
Corned beef sandwiches
are for lunch.

11:55.708 --> 12:00.125
If it's morning, you can't have
it. If it's lunchtime, you can.

12:03.042 --> 12:04.625
Is it lunchtime?

12:10.875 --> 12:14.167
I'm sure
it's lunchtime somewhere.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.042
Excellent answer.

12:19.667 --> 12:20.958
Here.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.792
'I ate half of that myself.'

12:26.875 --> 12:29.708
Killing you
does nobody any good.

12:29.792 --> 12:33.000
I told you, I'm here
to ensure your cooperation

12:33.083 --> 12:36.917
and I can't do that
if you're dead, now can I?

12:41.958 --> 12:43.250
'It does prove, though'

12:43.333 --> 12:46.792
'how everything
is a matter of perspective.'

12:48.083 --> 12:49.500
You see
what you think is daylight

12:49.583 --> 12:50.750
and you assume it's morning

12:50.833 --> 12:52.625
take it away,
you think it's night.

12:52.708 --> 12:54.292
Offer you a sandwich,
if it's convenient

12:54.375 --> 12:57.208
you'll think it's midday.
The truth is fluid.

12:57.292 --> 12:59.917
The truth is subjective.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.625
'Out there, it doesn't matter
what time it is.'

13:02.708 --> 13:07.250
In here, it's lunchtime
if you and I decide that it is.

13:07.333 --> 13:10.500
The truth is sometimes
what you believe it to be

13:10.583 --> 13:13.583
and other times
what you decide it to be.

13:16.792 --> 13:20.833
My task is to make you..

13:20.917 --> 13:23.917
...decide to believe
differently.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.625
And when that happens..

13:26.708 --> 13:30.000
...the world will remake itself
before your very eyes.

13:30.083 --> 13:32.417
- Not a chance.
- No?

13:32.500 --> 13:34.208
You've done it before.

13:35.792 --> 13:38.083
- When?
- When haven't you?

13:38.167 --> 13:40.458
When you were a soldier,
you fought the Minbari.

13:40.542 --> 13:43.375
The Minbari were the enemy.
That was the truth.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.083
And then one day someone said
the Minbari are no longer

13:46.167 --> 13:49.375
the enemy,
and that was the truth.

13:49.458 --> 13:53.250
And you not only accepted them
as allies, you embraced them.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.708
You took one of them as a lover.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.292
It's not the way--

13:56.375 --> 13:59.083
You swore an oath to Earthforce
because you believed in it.

13:59.167 --> 14:00.625
That was the truth.

14:00.708 --> 14:03.667
Now Earthforce is supposed
to be the enemy.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.083
Now that is the truth.

14:05.167 --> 14:06.625
It all depends on
what you believe

14:06.708 --> 14:08.792
and what other people
tell you to believe.

14:08.875 --> 14:11.083
The truth is fluid.
The truth is subjective.

14:11.167 --> 14:13.917
- No!
- Governments make policy.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.333
Soldiers have to accept those
policies

14:16.417 --> 14:19.458
even when they're completely
contradictory.

14:19.542 --> 14:22.375
'It's the very definition
of your job.'

14:22.458 --> 14:25.417
A soldier accepts
that the face of truth

14:25.500 --> 14:28.375
changes on a daily basis

14:28.458 --> 14:31.917
unless you're rejecting
everything that you said

14:32.000 --> 14:34.167
you stood for.
Is that what you're doing?

14:41.292 --> 14:43.292
Mm.

14:43.375 --> 14:45.125
Thanks for the sandwich.

14:45.208 --> 14:48.833
You're right.
The corned beef is perfect.

14:48.917 --> 14:52.792
The mustard's a little weak
for my tastes.

14:52.875 --> 14:54.208
Now you're being evasive.

14:54.292 --> 14:56.250
It's better
than being dishonest.

14:56.333 --> 14:57.583
Really?

14:57.667 --> 14:59.375
You said it was lunchtime,
even though you knew

14:59.458 --> 15:01.458
almost certainly
that it was not.

15:01.542 --> 15:04.125
You said that you've never been
influenced by other people

15:04.208 --> 15:07.292
and you and I both know
that's impossible.

15:07.375 --> 15:10.375
I, however, have spoken the
utter and unvarnished truth

15:10.458 --> 15:11.958
from the moment
I came through that door.

15:12.042 --> 15:15.542
Now, which one of us
is being dishonest?

15:24.958 --> 15:27.750
I just remembered
it's time for supper.

15:32.625 --> 15:36.083
You know,
about that sandwich, captain..

15:37.458 --> 15:40.250
...it's a funny thing
about toxins.

15:40.333 --> 15:43.958
I've always felt that if you eat
a little poison every day..

15:45.292 --> 15:46.917
...you get used to it.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.167
'It desensitizes you
until you can swallow'

15:49.250 --> 15:52.792
large amounts of it
with no difficulty whatsoever.

15:54.125 --> 15:57.250
I've always thought that
that was a metaphor.

15:57.333 --> 16:00.333
I could just
never decide what for.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.833
The contents of the sandwich
will not kill you.

16:02.917 --> 16:05.417
As I said,
they want you alive for now

16:05.500 --> 16:08.958
but the toxins will begin
having their desired effects

16:09.042 --> 16:10.750
in just a few minutes.

16:14.167 --> 16:18.208
I'll be back when they've had a
chance to clean up the place.

16:30.083 --> 16:33.125
[coughing]

16:41.667 --> 16:43.417
Good morning.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.708
How are we feeling? Hmm?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.875
Poison's all flushed out?

16:57.167 --> 16:58.750
Well, let's see.

17:03.083 --> 17:05.708
'Yes. It must have been
a rough night.'

17:05.792 --> 17:08.458
The jaundice will pass
in a couple of hours.

17:09.708 --> 17:12.167
I'm sorry I had to do that.

17:15.333 --> 17:16.958
Part of the process.

17:17.042 --> 17:21.250
We have to break you physically
before we can get to your mind.

17:21.333 --> 17:26.458
Personally,
I find it distasteful and crude

17:26.542 --> 17:29.458
but they don't listen to me.

17:29.542 --> 17:32.458
Well, actually,
they do listen to me.

17:32.542 --> 17:35.292
They listen to both of us.

17:35.375 --> 17:39.000
My superiors monitor
all of the interrogation rooms

17:39.083 --> 17:41.125
randomly throughout the day.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.833
If they don't
see some indication

17:44.917 --> 17:46.792
that you're
willing to cooperate..

17:49.875 --> 17:52.417
...well,
I can't be held responsible

17:52.500 --> 17:55.083
for the consequences.

17:55.167 --> 17:57.458
The best thing for you
to do is cooperate.

17:57.542 --> 17:59.500
They'll let you go then.

18:02.542 --> 18:05.667
You're dehydrated,
which is not surprising

18:05.750 --> 18:08.667
'considering that
you just upchucked'

18:08.750 --> 18:11.875
'everything you've been eating
for the last four days.'

18:11.958 --> 18:13.667
'This'll help.'

18:13.750 --> 18:16.042
You need to build
your salts back up

18:16.125 --> 18:18.042
restore your body's fluids.

18:23.208 --> 18:24.583
'Here.'

18:31.875 --> 18:35.125
Captain, I've told you the truth
from the beginning.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.625
Now I'm telling you
that this is safe.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.167
Understand..

18:47.625 --> 18:52.417
...I'm the one and only ally
you have in this place.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.000
'I won't lie to you.'

18:54.083 --> 18:57.083
What I tell you
will be the absolute truth.

18:57.167 --> 19:00.042
This is safe.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.875
Drink it.

19:11.625 --> 19:15.708
'I recommend taking it
in small sips to start with'

19:15.792 --> 19:18.125
until your body adjusts.

19:20.667 --> 19:24.042
We don't want a repeat of what
happened last night, now do we?

19:28.333 --> 19:31.917
'I've been going over
your files the last night.'

19:32.000 --> 19:36.208
'I found some omissions
that, uh, we need to correct.'

19:36.292 --> 19:38.000
There are just a few
bookkeeping points

19:38.083 --> 19:41.167
nothing
of a compromising nature.

19:41.250 --> 19:44.000
[sighs]
Your second in command..

19:45.792 --> 19:49.250
Her name was Susan Ivanova?
Is that correct?

19:49.333 --> 19:51.042
[coughing]

19:51.125 --> 19:53.042
Earth has all the records.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.583
Well, yes, but only up until
the time you broke away.

19:55.667 --> 19:59.583
After that,
everything gets a little fuzzy.

19:59.667 --> 20:02.083
We just need to confirm her name
for the records.

20:02.167 --> 20:06.250
There's no harm in that.
No reason you shouldn't tell me.

20:06.333 --> 20:11.167
- Oh. Sure, there is.
- And why is that?

20:11.250 --> 20:13.208
Because you want it.

20:13.292 --> 20:17.250
I told you, I don't want
anything. I really don't care.

20:17.333 --> 20:21.958
But my superiors don't like
blank spaces in their records.

20:22.042 --> 20:26.125
They want everything neat,
tidy and complete.

20:28.708 --> 20:31.292
- 'Feeling better?'
- A little.

20:31.375 --> 20:35.375
Good. Then, perhaps,
you'd care to join me?

20:44.250 --> 20:45.875
[groans]

21:11.833 --> 21:15.042
- Wh..
- It's for your own good.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.000
Don't want you to hurt yourself.

21:19.792 --> 21:22.000
'Oh, uh, and by the way,
I should mention'

21:22.083 --> 21:23.583
your father..

21:25.917 --> 21:27.375
He sends his regards.

21:28.958 --> 21:31.958
'He's being held at another
facility a few miles from here'

21:32.042 --> 21:36.792
and one of my associates
is, uh, handling his case.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.875
When I stopped by to pick up
your report

21:38.958 --> 21:41.208
I, um, passed him in the hall.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.667
- Then he's still alive.
- Alive and well.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.708
- Why are you telling me this?
- 'Why not?'

21:50.792 --> 21:54.583
I told you, I have no vested
interest in helping you

21:54.667 --> 21:57.708
or harming you
as long as the job gets done.

21:57.792 --> 22:00.458
He made a request,
it didn't go against my orders

22:00.542 --> 22:02.000
so I passed it along.

22:04.042 --> 22:07.542
Thank you would be
the appropriate response.

22:12.125 --> 22:13.708
Thank you.

22:15.208 --> 22:19.792
Yes, I imagine that we'll only
hold him as long as we hold you

22:19.875 --> 22:22.958
but, of course, that means
that as long as you continue

22:23.042 --> 22:26.792
to resist, we can't let him go.

22:31.208 --> 22:33.292
You've been interrogated before?

22:33.375 --> 22:35.042
Yes.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.375
Anyone I know?

22:38.208 --> 22:39.583
You'd be surprised.

22:39.667 --> 22:41.000
Well, it's certainly strange.

22:41.083 --> 22:42.667
You don't seem
to know the rules.

22:42.750 --> 22:46.750
Perhaps, I should explain them
in case you've forgotten.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.500
This is your confession.

22:50.583 --> 22:54.458
It goes on at some length.
So, uh, allow me to summarize.

22:54.542 --> 22:57.458
You plead guilty to charges
of treason, mutiny

22:57.542 --> 22:59.667
conspiracy to commit mutiny,
sedition, terrorism--

22:59.750 --> 23:00.917
That's a lie.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.667
Conspiracy to overthrow
the government

23:02.750 --> 23:04.458
illegal seizure
of Earth property

23:04.542 --> 23:06.292
assault on fellow officers.

23:06.375 --> 23:07.792
- 'Sabotage..'
- Now, just a minute.

23:07.875 --> 23:09.667
'Willful destruction
of public property'

23:09.750 --> 23:11.625
disobeying direct
orders of superior officers

23:11.708 --> 23:14.333
and the murder of 547 officers

23:14.417 --> 23:16.458
and crew on board
the EAS Roanoke.

23:16.542 --> 23:19.167
- I won't sign it!
- You will sign it!

23:19.250 --> 23:22.375
You will sign it,
and you will read it aloud

23:22.458 --> 23:23.792
in full view of the public

23:23.875 --> 23:25.625
so they'll know that
we haven't forged your image

23:25.708 --> 23:27.833
or your signature.

23:27.917 --> 23:31.417
You will name your accomplices,
you will apologize

23:31.500 --> 23:34.125
to the families and friends
of those who died fighting you

23:34.208 --> 23:37.458
and in the end, you will
beg for mercy on the grounds

23:37.542 --> 23:39.167
that you're under
the influence of aliens

23:39.250 --> 23:40.875
who are trying to subvert
the government

23:40.958 --> 23:43.292
and undermine the authority
of the president.

23:43.375 --> 23:44.958
I demand to see an attorney!

23:45.042 --> 23:48.292
I demand the presence
of a full military tribunal!

23:48.375 --> 23:52.542
- You have no right!
- No, you have no rights!

23:52.625 --> 23:55.333
There's no courtroom here,
captain.

23:55.417 --> 24:00.167
No tribunals, no attorneys,
no justice, no mercy

24:00.250 --> 24:03.375
no fairness, no hope

24:03.458 --> 24:06.167
'no last-minute escape.'

24:06.250 --> 24:09.417
You will walk through that door
when you confess

24:09.500 --> 24:11.875
and not one second before!

24:28.125 --> 24:29.667
Good morning.

24:34.042 --> 24:37.083
[intense music]

25:18.917 --> 25:20.500
[coughing]

25:26.542 --> 25:31.250
There, now.
That should do it.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.958
Now, would you please repeat
what you told one of our

25:34.042 --> 25:36.375
other interrogators last night?

25:41.458 --> 25:46.125
I was one of those
who was responsible

25:46.208 --> 25:48.250
for manipulating
Captain Sheridan

25:48.333 --> 25:50.958
into turning against
his own government.

25:51.042 --> 25:52.500
Don't do this.

25:52.583 --> 25:58.083
I confess to taking part
in a conspiracy

25:58.167 --> 26:00.292
to overturn your government.

26:00.375 --> 26:02.250
You're giving them
exactly what they want.

26:02.333 --> 26:06.875
Precisely, and when he's done,
he'll be able to leave.

26:06.958 --> 26:09.708
Continue. We can edit out
the interruptions later.

26:12.167 --> 26:15.500
Those who worked with me
in this conspiracy..

26:16.875 --> 26:19.208
...were
Commander Susan Ivanova..

26:20.625 --> 26:22.958
...Minbari Ambassador Delenn..

26:24.625 --> 26:28.292
...Senator Ross Fowler.

26:28.375 --> 26:30.833
He's not actually
involved in any of this

26:30.917 --> 26:33.042
but he's recently
become a source of annoyance

26:33.125 --> 26:35.000
to the president.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.833
Waste not, want not.

26:38.333 --> 26:44.583
I can personally verify all
of the charges against him.

26:44.667 --> 26:49.458
However, Captain Sheridan was
not responsible for his actions.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.375
He was not..

26:53.083 --> 26:55.167
- Mentally competent--
- Stop it!

26:55.250 --> 26:58.125
Listen to me! Listen to me.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.833
Now, I don't know
what they did to you in here.

27:02.917 --> 27:05.792
I know it must have been
terrible

27:05.875 --> 27:08.625
but it's all out here.
It's all flesh.

27:10.000 --> 27:13.625
Now, I know you feel
that they've won

27:13.708 --> 27:17.625
but as long as you don't break
inside, they can't win.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.333
Don't do this.

27:19.417 --> 27:22.542
He's trying to save you trouble,
captain. He's your alibi.

27:22.625 --> 27:24.875
He's the one chance
you have of avoiding

27:24.958 --> 27:26.375
the death penalty
for your actions.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.875
I know the Drazi.
I've worked with your people.

27:29.958 --> 27:31.750
I fought alongside them
in the war.

27:31.833 --> 27:34.750
'You're a strong race,
a proud race.'

27:34.833 --> 27:37.042
You'll bend,
but you don't break.

27:37.125 --> 27:38.542
The ones that have
done this to you

27:38.625 --> 27:41.125
they are the ones
that have been broken.

27:41.208 --> 27:45.083
- There is nothing I can do.
- Yes, there is!

27:45.167 --> 27:46.375
You can fight.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.333
You can refuse to surrender.
You can refuse to be broken.

27:51.417 --> 27:54.708
You just have to say,
"No, I won't" one more time

27:54.792 --> 27:56.583
than they can say,
"Yes, you will."

27:56.667 --> 27:59.083
Captain..

27:59.167 --> 28:03.417
The moment you surrender,
you become expendable.

28:05.375 --> 28:08.250
I'm afraid.

28:08.333 --> 28:12.083
I've never been afraid before.

28:12.167 --> 28:13.958
We're all afraid.

28:16.333 --> 28:19.500
Don't give them what they want.

28:19.583 --> 28:21.250
Don't.

28:25.833 --> 28:27.292
Don't.

28:37.542 --> 28:39.875
I have nothing more to say.

28:43.375 --> 28:46.167
I will not cooperate
any further.

28:55.875 --> 28:57.542
Are you sure?

28:57.625 --> 29:01.625
Do you understand
that this is your last chance?

29:01.708 --> 29:03.875
What are you doing?

29:03.958 --> 29:09.292
Do you understand that this
is your very last chance?

29:15.042 --> 29:16.292
Yes.

29:29.250 --> 29:32.750
Oh, no, no, no.
No, let him go.

29:32.833 --> 29:34.250
He's done nothing to you.

29:35.542 --> 29:37.500
I've never even seen him
before in my life.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.375
He's got nothing to do
with this.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.708
For God's sakes, let him go.

29:44.667 --> 29:45.958
'No.'

29:50.833 --> 29:52.458
Room 17.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.542
Now, I was asking you
about Commander Ivanova.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.458
What are you gonna do with him?

30:08.542 --> 30:11.667
It's nothing you need
to concern yourself with.

30:11.750 --> 30:14.625
Now, about your contacts
with the Resistance.

30:14.708 --> 30:17.958
If you could provide me with,
say, three or four names

30:18.042 --> 30:20.750
it would go a long way toward
convincing my superiors--

30:20.833 --> 30:23.000
I said, what are you going
to do with him?

30:28.458 --> 30:29.667
[sighs]

30:33.417 --> 30:36.500
You must understand
he was expendable

30:36.583 --> 30:40.458
from the moment he arrived.
We are all expendable.

30:42.083 --> 30:43.792
'Just parts in a machine.'

30:44.875 --> 30:46.542
You're lucky.

30:48.625 --> 30:51.042
You were deemed non-expendable
when you got here.

30:51.125 --> 30:53.542
Even I don't fall
into that category.

30:56.542 --> 31:02.125
But the patience of my superiors
is not without limit.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.458
'You are alive
because it's convenient'

31:04.542 --> 31:08.208
and because they want you
honestly and sincerely broken

31:08.292 --> 31:10.083
in case someone scans you.

31:10.167 --> 31:13.458
It has to be a sincere apology.

31:13.542 --> 31:15.750
This will encourage
the others who worked with you

31:15.833 --> 31:18.792
to reconsider their position.

31:18.875 --> 31:22.083
It would save us a tremendous
amount of time and trouble.

31:24.625 --> 31:27.125
Unless you become an even
greater source

31:27.208 --> 31:29.583
of time and trouble.

31:29.667 --> 31:31.708
[Drazi screaming]

31:37.708 --> 31:39.875
I'm sorry they had to do that.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.667
But as I told you,
it's not my choice.

31:52.500 --> 31:55.125
[automated message]
'You will cooperate
with the state for the good'

31:55.208 --> 31:57.208
'of the state
and your own survival.'

31:57.292 --> 32:00.750
'You will confess to the crimes
of which you have been accused.'

32:00.833 --> 32:03.375
'You will be released
and return to society'

32:03.458 --> 32:06.292
'a productive citizen
if you cooperate.'

32:06.375 --> 32:10.833
'Resistance will be punished.
Cooperation will be rewarded.'

32:10.917 --> 32:13.375
(male #1)
'Goodnight.
I'll see you in the morning.'

32:13.458 --> 32:16.917
[automated message]
'You will cooperate with the
state for the good of the state'

32:17.000 --> 32:18.958
'and your own survival.'

32:19.042 --> 32:23.042
'You will confess to the crimes
of which you have been accused.'

32:23.125 --> 32:25.667
'You will be released
and return to society'

32:25.750 --> 32:28.583
'a productive citizen
if you cooperate.'

32:30.583 --> 32:32.500
'You will cooperate with the
state for the good of the state'

32:32.583 --> 32:34.042
'and your own survival.'

32:34.125 --> 32:37.167
'You will confess to the crimes
of which you have been accused.'

32:37.250 --> 32:39.708
'You will be released
and return to society'

32:39.792 --> 32:42.833
'a productive citizen
if you cooperate.'

32:42.917 --> 32:47.833
'Resistance will be punished.
Cooperation will be rewarded.'

32:50.292 --> 32:51.458
Good morning.

33:08.125 --> 33:12.375
I should tell you that
unless you begin to cooperate

33:12.458 --> 33:16.333
you won't be receiving
any more intravenous nutrition.

33:21.292 --> 33:24.083
It's bad enough they had me
take you off solid food.

33:26.042 --> 33:28.458
Don't compound
the error further.

33:36.458 --> 33:37.833
That piece of paper..

33:39.667 --> 33:41.917
...and a few words
from you are all

33:42.000 --> 33:44.833
that's standing
between you and that door.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.333
'Don't you see
how foolish this is?'

33:50.833 --> 33:53.875
I'm not keeping you here.

33:53.958 --> 33:56.625
They're not keeping you here.
You're keeping you here.

33:58.208 --> 34:02.167
And are you suicidal
or simply self-destructive

34:02.250 --> 34:05.250
preferring to let us
do the work for you?

34:13.208 --> 34:14.750
Don't you want to leave?

34:16.042 --> 34:17.792
'Don't you want to be free?'

34:19.042 --> 34:21.167
Walk through that door?

34:21.250 --> 34:23.875
Feel the sun on your face again?

34:26.250 --> 34:30.542
- Yes.
- 'Then sign it and speak.'

34:30.625 --> 34:33.708
'That's all. Then you can go.'

34:36.042 --> 34:38.792
They don't want you dead.

34:38.875 --> 34:41.708
They want you as a symbol,
not a martyr.

34:41.792 --> 34:44.250
As a warning to others.

34:44.333 --> 34:47.000
- Then you'll kill me.
- No.

34:48.542 --> 34:50.292
Absolutely not.

34:53.583 --> 34:56.583
I told you
I won't lie to you.

34:58.083 --> 35:01.333
No, they'll come
for you eventually.

35:01.417 --> 35:06.000
But they'll wait
until you've been forgotten.

35:06.083 --> 35:10.167
'Until your fate no longer
means anything to anyone.'

35:10.250 --> 35:13.792
They'll come in the night.
It will be very quick.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.667
But until that time..

35:17.500 --> 35:19.417
...you will have your freedom.

35:20.833 --> 35:24.042
If anything,
they'll encourage you to travel

35:24.125 --> 35:26.875
so that more people
can see you as..

35:26.958 --> 35:30.792
...as a symbol of the
pre-eminent truth of our time..

35:32.125 --> 35:34.875
...that you cannot
beat the system.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.042
'I'm telling you the truth.'

35:39.125 --> 35:45.708
'Sign and speak,
and you can leave here.'

35:45.792 --> 35:48.042
It's really that simple.

35:58.292 --> 36:00.292
'I know you can do it.'

36:01.625 --> 36:03.833
'I know you want to do it.'

36:07.500 --> 36:09.208
Well?

36:24.958 --> 36:26.167
No.

36:33.667 --> 36:34.833
I..

36:36.375 --> 36:40.000
I really wish you hadn't done
that, captain.

36:40.083 --> 36:41.500
I really..

36:43.833 --> 36:45.583
...sincerely wish..

36:48.208 --> 36:50.042
...you hadn't done that.

36:54.958 --> 36:56.750
I, I..

36:59.042 --> 37:01.667
I have no control over
what will happen next.

37:04.250 --> 37:06.208
It's out of my hands.

37:19.625 --> 37:22.500
[dramatic music]

37:24.833 --> 37:27.458
Right.
Now, listen to me. Wake up.

37:27.542 --> 37:31.708
There's something
you have to understand. Focus.

37:31.792 --> 37:34.000
Focus on me.

37:34.083 --> 37:37.167
Do you know why
they're doing this to you?

37:37.250 --> 37:39.542
Because you're a war hero,
one of the few to come out

37:39.625 --> 37:41.000
'of the Minbari War.'

37:41.083 --> 37:43.833
They've invested a considerable
amount of time and effort

37:43.917 --> 37:46.333
making you a hero
in the public's eye.

37:48.042 --> 37:51.417
The problem is, when a war hero
starts believing certain things

37:51.500 --> 37:54.833
and saying certain things,
the public listens.

37:54.917 --> 37:57.167
They figure maybe
there's something to it.

37:57.250 --> 38:02.500
Your credibility has become
a threat to their credibility.

38:02.583 --> 38:04.542
So one of them has to go.

38:08.250 --> 38:12.583
The best way out for everyone
is for you to confess

38:12.667 --> 38:14.125
and lay the blame
for what's happened

38:14.208 --> 38:15.625
'at the feet
of the alien government.'

38:15.708 --> 38:17.250
'Whether it's true or not,
it doesn't matter.'

38:17.333 --> 38:19.417
'Truth is immaterial.
They can sell it.'

38:19.500 --> 38:20.958
And they will let you live.

38:21.042 --> 38:23.667
Note,
I said, it is the best way.

38:23.750 --> 38:26.250
I did not say,
it was the only way.

38:30.167 --> 38:35.125
The other way, captain,
is a Posthumous Confession.

38:35.208 --> 38:38.500
Your signature is not a problem.
They have your image on file.

38:38.583 --> 38:42.000
They can create you
reading the confession.

38:42.083 --> 38:44.208
Now, that's not as good
as having you where people

38:44.292 --> 38:46.583
can see you,
so they know it's true that

38:46.667 --> 38:49.375
even you can be broken,
you cannot resist.

38:49.458 --> 38:52.375
With a video record,
there will always be doubt.

38:53.792 --> 38:56.917
It's not the same
as breaking you

38:57.000 --> 38:59.375
but I'm told that
as of this morning..

39:04.500 --> 39:07.625
...it is an acceptable option.

39:13.375 --> 39:16.417
I can save your life.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.333
Right now.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.792
If you'll let me.

39:24.417 --> 39:27.750
You know, it's funny.

39:27.833 --> 39:31.333
I was thinking about
what you said.

39:31.417 --> 39:36.417
The pre-eminent truth
of our age is that you cannot

39:36.500 --> 39:39.167
fight the system.

39:39.250 --> 39:40.792
[scoffs]

39:40.875 --> 39:45.042
But if, as you say,
the truth is fluid

39:45.125 --> 39:48.667
that the truth is subjective..

39:48.750 --> 39:51.833
...then maybe
you can fight the system..

39:51.917 --> 39:56.583
...as long as just one person
refuses to be broken

39:56.667 --> 40:00.375
refuses...to bow down.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.917
But can you win?

40:05.417 --> 40:09.625
Every time I say no.

40:21.917 --> 40:24.917
Captain John Sheridan,
will you or will you not

40:25.000 --> 40:28.958
sign a confession and endorse it
before a public hearing?

40:31.750 --> 40:33.500
No.

40:36.875 --> 40:38.875
[dramatic music]

40:44.958 --> 40:46.625
[grunting]

40:50.958 --> 40:53.208
Do you understand that
this is your last chance?

40:53.292 --> 40:57.625
Do you understand that
this is your very last chance?

41:01.417 --> 41:02.792
Room 17.

41:08.583 --> 41:11.500
Almighty God, look upon your
servant lying in great weakness

41:11.583 --> 41:13.375
and comfort him,
deliver him from all evil

41:13.458 --> 41:15.208
and set him free
from every bond.

41:15.292 --> 41:18.167
No man lives to himself,
and no man dies to himself.

41:18.250 --> 41:21.583
If we live, we live unto God.
If we die, we die unto God.

41:21.667 --> 41:23.542
Therefore into your hands,
we commend your servant

41:23.625 --> 41:26.208
a sheep of your own fold,
a lamb of your own flock.

41:26.292 --> 41:28.208
Receive him into the arms
of your mercy.

41:28.292 --> 41:30.500
May his soul rest in peace.
Amen.

42:17.333 --> 42:19.375
What? What?

42:21.542 --> 42:23.000
[groans]

42:43.542 --> 42:45.083
Good morning.

42:45.167 --> 42:48.167
Now, before we begin
your interrogation

42:48.250 --> 42:50.792
'I'll need some information.'

42:50.875 --> 42:52.458
'Do you have any allergies
or illnesses'

42:52.542 --> 42:53.792
'that I should know about?'

42:53.875 --> 42:55.542
'Are you currently taking
any medication?'

42:55.625 --> 42:58.833
'Had any trouble
with your heart?'

42:58.917 --> 43:00.792
'You'll answer my questions
when they are asked.'

43:00.875 --> 43:04.083
'Resistance will be punished.
Cooperation will be rewarded.'

43:04.167 --> 43:05.708
'Do you have any illnesses
or allergies'

43:05.792 --> 43:07.333
that I should know about?

43:07.417 --> 43:09.167
Are you currently
taking any medication?

43:09.250 --> 43:11.625
Have you had any trouble
with your heart?

43:11.708 --> 43:13.500
'You'll answer my questions
when they are asked.'

43:13.583 --> 43:16.125
'Resistance will be punished,
cooperation will be rewarded.'

43:16.208 --> 43:17.500
'Do you have any allergies
or illnesses'

43:17.583 --> 43:19.625
'that I should know about?'

43:19.708 --> 43:21.542
'Are you currently
taking any medication?'

43:21.625 --> 43:23.875
'Have you had any trouble
with your heart?'

43:26.750 --> 43:29.500
'You will answer my questions
when they are asked.'

43:29.583 --> 43:33.000
Resistance will be punished.
Cooperation will be rewarded.

43:34.250 --> 43:36.667
