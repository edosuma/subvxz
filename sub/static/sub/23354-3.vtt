00:01.998 --> 00:03.931
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares,

00:03.931 --> 00:05.964
Gordon goes
to Ridgewood, New Jersey

00:05.964 --> 00:09.498
to meet the most defensive chef
he's ever met--

00:09.498 --> 00:10.931
Paul Bazzini.

00:10.931 --> 00:12.731
I don't have
all the tickets memorized!

00:12.731 --> 00:14.764
Not only is the restaurant
failing...

00:14.764 --> 00:16.131
I don't want to get out
of bed in the morning.

00:16.131 --> 00:17.764
I'm miserable.

00:17.764 --> 00:19.564
But his staff are fed up
with his tantrums...

00:19.564 --> 00:20.731
That's why
you have a ticket!

00:20.731 --> 00:21.998
Don't push it, Paul!

00:21.998 --> 00:23.098
Well, what's with
the  sarcasm?

00:23.098 --> 00:25.064
What the
do you want from me?

00:25.064 --> 00:27.731
His wife is fed up
with his attitude...

00:27.731 --> 00:29.064
Never saw anything
like it in my life.

00:29.064 --> 00:30.000
Think that I like this?
I don't.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.098
Think that I like this?
I don't.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.464
I have nothing else
to say to you.

00:32.464 --> 00:34.998
And the customers are fed up
with not being fed.

00:34.998 --> 00:36.831
Get my food, now!

00:36.831 --> 00:39.164
And every time
something goes wrong...

00:39.164 --> 00:40.798
We're sinking
like the titanicin here!

00:40.798 --> 00:42.331
All Paul wants to do...

00:42.331 --> 00:43.664
I can't
do everything myself.

00:43.664 --> 00:44.764
Is give excuse...

00:44.764 --> 00:45.764
Don't have eyes
in the back of my head.

00:45.764 --> 00:46.998
After excuse...

00:46.998 --> 00:47.998
I'm doing 400 things
at once.

00:47.998 --> 00:49.898
After excuse.

00:49.898 --> 00:51.398
I can't cook and talk
and manage the tickets.

00:51.398 --> 00:52.398
I need help.

00:52.398 --> 00:54.264
Stop.

00:54.264 --> 00:55.764
You have given up.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.231
Will Chef Ramsay be able
to finally get though to him...

00:58.231 --> 00:59.931
Have some fire
in your belly!

00:59.931 --> 01:00.000
Or will Paul finally
run out of excuses?

01:00.000 --> 01:02.564
Or will Paul finally
run out of excuses?

01:02.564 --> 01:03.931
I know that it starts
and stops with me.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.831
You say
all the right things.

01:05.831 --> 01:07.331
Find out tonight

01:07.331 --> 01:09.098
On Kitchen Nightmares.

01:09.098 --> 01:11.598
Now it's time
to do the right things.

01:30.764 --> 01:31.898
Ridgewood, New Jersey,

01:31.898 --> 01:33.998
An affluent suburb
well known

01:33.998 --> 01:35.898
for the sheer volume
of restaurants.

01:35.898 --> 01:37.731
Smack in the middle
of this pleasant town

01:37.731 --> 01:39.064
is a five-year-old restaurant

01:39.064 --> 01:41.798
run by a former
Manhattan star chef,

01:41.798 --> 01:42.998
Paul Bazzini.

01:42.998 --> 01:44.231
I'm a very good chef.

01:44.231 --> 01:45.331
We got a full dining room.

01:45.331 --> 01:46.731
Drop another pan
for four more.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.331
Here we go.

01:48.331 --> 01:49.664
I've always been
in the industry

01:49.664 --> 01:51.398
and worked my way up,
became executive chef,

01:51.398 --> 01:54.131
and worked in many places
in Manhattan

01:54.131 --> 01:55.598
that had a lot of notoriety.

01:55.598 --> 01:57.431
I love you.
Love you too.

01:57.431 --> 01:58.464
Paul has been recognized

01:58.464 --> 02:00.000
many times
throughout his career.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.131
many times
throughout his career.

02:00.131 --> 02:02.931
He has been written up
in several magazines

02:02.931 --> 02:04.964
with some
very positive reviews.

02:04.964 --> 02:06.564
And I absolutely
thought the restaurant

02:06.564 --> 02:09.598
was going to be a success.

02:09.598 --> 02:11.431
But Paul never anticipated

02:11.431 --> 02:14.331
The transition
from star chef to owner

02:14.331 --> 02:15.564
would be so difficult.

02:15.564 --> 02:17.098
I don't have any focus
these days.

02:17.098 --> 02:18.431
I wake up in the morning,
and I say,

02:18.431 --> 02:19.798
"What direction
should I go in today?

02:19.798 --> 02:20.798
"Should I cook?
Should I shop?

02:20.798 --> 02:22.298
"Should I work
in the front of the house?

02:22.298 --> 02:23.764
Should I work on marketing?
Should I pay bills?"

02:23.764 --> 02:25.098
And it's, like,
overwhelming.

02:25.098 --> 02:26.798
Killing me.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.598
I think the pressure
of owning the restaurant

02:28.598 --> 02:30.000
has definitely
beat him down,

02:30.000 --> 02:30.064
has definitely
beat him down,

02:30.064 --> 02:32.898
and his passion for food
is not burning as brightly

02:32.898 --> 02:33.931
as it once was.

02:33.931 --> 02:35.931
Clearly, what's going on
with me in the kitchen

02:35.931 --> 02:36.998
is suffering.

02:36.998 --> 02:38.064
Here's your salad.

02:38.064 --> 02:39.631
What salad, what table?

02:39.631 --> 02:41.464
I'm confused.
I'm confused.

02:41.464 --> 02:42.764
Yeah, New York strip,
New York strip, New York--

02:42.764 --> 02:43.798
Okay, you're right.

02:43.798 --> 02:46.264
I am distracted.
I am frustrated.

02:46.264 --> 02:47.731
I'm angry.

02:47.731 --> 02:50.098
Always somebody, always
somebody, always somebody.

02:50.098 --> 02:51.598
And then I'm frustrated
with the food,

02:51.598 --> 02:52.798
and I'm slamming plates down,
'cause the plate

02:52.798 --> 02:54.264
doesn't look the way
that I want it to look.

02:54.264 --> 02:56.931
It's messy, but let's just
go with it, okay?

02:56.931 --> 02:58.298
The risotto was burned.

02:58.298 --> 03:00.000
I don't know.
Is this supposed to be spicy?

03:00.000 --> 03:00.331
I don't know.
Is this supposed to be spicy?

03:01.764 --> 03:03.164
Yeah, so I heard.

03:03.164 --> 03:04.831
I don't feel like me.
I feel like somebody else.

03:04.831 --> 03:07.931
I feel like me
looking at somebody else.

03:09.164 --> 03:12.131
Everyone knows that he's
just not good about criticism.

03:12.131 --> 03:13.964
This needs to be
heated up.

03:13.964 --> 03:15.564
These are perfect.
Okay!

03:15.564 --> 03:17.264
He gets pissed off,
and he yells.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.064
I don't have
all the tickets memorized!

03:19.064 --> 03:20.131
Neither do I!

03:20.131 --> 03:21.131
Well, that's why
you have a ticket!

03:21.131 --> 03:22.564
Yeah, okay.

03:22.564 --> 03:23.798
Do you think,
if he had a lot of money,

03:23.798 --> 03:25.298
he wouldn't be
so  moody?

03:25.298 --> 03:26.464
Ohh!

03:26.464 --> 03:29.931
I support the restaurant
financially, certainly.

03:29.931 --> 03:30.000
If I didn't do that,

03:30.000 --> 03:30.964
If I didn't do that,

03:30.964 --> 03:32.598
we would have
been bankrupt years ago.

03:32.598 --> 03:34.831
There's no magic ATM machine,
like, in the backyard,

03:34.831 --> 03:37.298
like a magic money tree that
I can just go pick money from.

03:37.298 --> 03:39.064
There are no college funds
for our children.

03:39.064 --> 03:40.964
Every day I'm scared

03:40.964 --> 03:43.064
that we're not gonna be able
to pay the bills.

03:43.064 --> 03:44.898
We need help.
We need direction.

03:44.898 --> 03:45.931
We need advice.

03:45.931 --> 03:47.898
And my resume
and all of my accolades

03:47.898 --> 03:49.764
don't mean a hill of beans

03:49.764 --> 03:51.798
if I can't make it work here.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.931
His passion
for cooking defines him.

03:54.931 --> 03:57.431
And I feel like
it's lost to him right now.

03:57.431 --> 03:58.998
He needs to get it back.

04:07.131 --> 04:09.831
There are over 60 restaurants
within four blocks

04:09.831 --> 04:10.998
inside this beautiful town.

04:10.998 --> 04:12.464
Now, after seeing
a few of them,

04:12.464 --> 04:13.464
my mouth is watering.

04:13.464 --> 04:14.731
I can't wait for lunch.

04:14.731 --> 04:16.898
Right--Bazzini's.

04:16.898 --> 04:18.398
"Innovative American cuisine."

04:23.598 --> 04:24.798
What?

04:26.931 --> 04:28.464
No...

04:28.464 --> 04:29.664
Am I too late?

04:29.664 --> 04:30.000
Monday through Thursday,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.931
Monday through Thursday,

04:31.931 --> 04:33.731
5:00 till 9:30."

04:35.264 --> 04:36.631
No lunch?

04:36.631 --> 04:37.798
That's ridiculous.

04:37.798 --> 04:40.264
"Hi, Paul. Gordon here.
Where are you? Call me."

04:42.931 --> 04:44.464
Unbelievable.

04:56.731 --> 04:57.731
Hello?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.131
Hi, may I speak
to Chef Ramsay, please?

04:59.131 --> 05:00.000
Is that Paul?

05:00.000 --> 05:00.331
Is that Paul?

05:00.331 --> 05:01.798
Hi, this is Paul Bazzini.
How are you?

05:01.798 --> 05:02.798
Sorry I missed you.

05:02.798 --> 05:04.464
I didn't realize
you were closed for lunch.

05:04.464 --> 05:05.831
Uh, yes, sir,
we're closed for lunch.

05:05.831 --> 05:06.764
Okay, I'm on my way.

05:10.131 --> 05:11.264
I'm starving.

05:13.398 --> 05:14.398
How are you?

05:14.398 --> 05:15.398
Hi, welcome to Bazzini's.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.764
Chef Ramsay,
pleasure to meet you.

05:16.764 --> 05:17.798
Gordon.
Gordon, Paul.

05:17.798 --> 05:19.798
Pleasure to meet you.
Nice to see you too.

05:19.798 --> 05:21.398
Wow, this is minute,
isn't it?

05:21.398 --> 05:22.798
It's challenging.

05:22.798 --> 05:24.631
my goodness me.
is this it?

05:24.631 --> 05:25.931
Yes, sir.

05:25.931 --> 05:27.264
Wow.

05:27.264 --> 05:28.631
It's like being inside
a doll's house.

05:28.631 --> 05:30.000
It--it has some
decor challenges here.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.598
It--it has some
decor challenges here.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.164
Well, you're here.
Yes, sir.

05:33.164 --> 05:34.664
Finally. I'm here.

05:34.664 --> 05:35.898
Um, clearly,

05:35.898 --> 05:37.898
there's nothing else
going on lunch-wise.

05:37.898 --> 05:39.498
Why don't you
cook me something?
Okay.

05:39.498 --> 05:40.898
Don't show me the menu.
You decide.

05:40.898 --> 05:42.231
Okay.
yeah?

05:42.231 --> 05:43.631
Yeah.

05:43.631 --> 05:44.831
I have to just, you know,

05:44.831 --> 05:46.431
Focus on, like, the food.

05:46.431 --> 05:48.931
Will it be to his taste?
Will it be to his opinion?

05:48.931 --> 05:50.998
Who knows?

05:52.298 --> 05:53.731
This place
makes me feel nervous.

05:53.731 --> 05:56.264
It's small.
It's cramped, and...

05:56.264 --> 05:57.764
No wonder
they're closed for lunch.

05:57.764 --> 05:59.431
God, this is so narrow.

05:59.431 --> 06:00.000
Look at this place.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.898
Look at this place.

06:00.898 --> 06:03.464
From one table to the next.
Ah.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.598
Ooh!

06:05.598 --> 06:07.398
God, they're grimy.

06:09.631 --> 06:10.964
That's depressing.

06:10.964 --> 06:13.464
Oof.

06:15.264 --> 06:16.931
Entree comes
with sound effects.

06:16.931 --> 06:18.998
Maybe he'll blow me away
with the food,

06:18.998 --> 06:20.831
because the atmosphere,
hmm.

06:20.831 --> 06:22.498
My God, it's depressing.

06:25.898 --> 06:27.464
I'm thinking that I want
to send out

06:27.464 --> 06:30.000
just a--just a few
light dishes to him--

06:30.000 --> 06:30.098
just a--just a few
light dishes to him--

06:30.098 --> 06:31.798
something hot,
something cold,

06:31.798 --> 06:33.631
something grilled,
something sauteed.

06:33.631 --> 06:35.798
Just a full-rounded
experience.

06:35.798 --> 06:37.331
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Alex.

06:37.331 --> 06:39.498
Hey, how's it going?
Pretty good.

06:39.498 --> 06:41.298
I think Chef Ramsay
is gonna have a lot of things

06:41.298 --> 06:43.398
to say to Paul
about how to change things.

06:43.398 --> 06:45.064
And I don't think Paul's
gonna take it well.

06:45.064 --> 06:46.798
Gentleman said
he was very hungry,

06:46.798 --> 06:48.264
so...
fair enough.

06:48.264 --> 06:49.631
I think Paul
has his own ideas

06:49.631 --> 06:51.064
that what he's doing
is just right.

06:51.064 --> 06:52.798
Doesn't need to be changed.

06:52.798 --> 06:54.931
And, uh, I think
some of those things

06:54.931 --> 06:55.931
do need to be changed.

06:55.931 --> 06:57.298
Here we go.

06:57.298 --> 06:59.731
That is the fettuccine.
Mm-hmm.

06:59.731 --> 07:00.000
Basil-arugula Pesto.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.398
Basil-arugula Pesto.

07:01.398 --> 07:02.731
A little ricotta salata
on top.

07:02.731 --> 07:03.731
Right.

07:03.731 --> 07:05.898
And then, behind that,
here is a chicken paillard.

07:05.898 --> 07:07.298
Those are milanese,
pounded, breaded.

07:07.298 --> 07:09.064
Excellent, and sorry,
I didn't catch your name?

07:09.064 --> 07:10.164
My name's Alex.
Alex.

07:10.164 --> 07:11.598
Charmed.
Good to see you.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.898
Pleasure.
I'll be back in a moment.

07:12.898 --> 07:15.064
Thank you, Alex.

07:18.231 --> 07:20.131
Cold.

07:20.131 --> 07:22.331
Bland, really bland.

07:22.331 --> 07:24.064
Okay.

07:24.064 --> 07:25.631
Look at this thing.

07:25.631 --> 07:27.831
Looks like a
elephant's foot.

07:29.464 --> 07:30.000
Hmm.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.164
Hmm.

07:35.398 --> 07:37.931
That's not normal for a chicken
to be so  hard.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.164
That's a mess.

07:47.164 --> 07:48.331
Thank you, Alex.

07:48.331 --> 07:49.731
Absolutely.

07:49.731 --> 07:50.764
Um, I'd appreciate
if the chef

07:50.764 --> 07:52.631
could actually
taste that...
okay.

07:52.631 --> 07:54.298
'Cause it is bland
beyond bland.

07:54.298 --> 07:55.431
Okay.

07:55.431 --> 07:56.731
Um, why is that so dry?

07:56.731 --> 07:58.331
Hmm...I wish
I had a good answer

07:58.331 --> 07:59.331
for that question.

07:59.331 --> 08:00.000
Chicken should be moist.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.998
Chicken should be moist.

08:00.998 --> 08:02.331
Well, I'll move straight
to the next course.

08:02.331 --> 08:03.898
Thank you.
sure.

08:05.631 --> 08:06.764
Fettuccine--
"Bland."

08:06.764 --> 08:08.598
Chicken--
"Why is it so dry?"

08:08.598 --> 08:10.498
Okay, that's.

08:10.498 --> 08:12.931
I want to go home.

08:12.931 --> 08:13.931
Paul certainly
doesn't like it

08:13.931 --> 08:15.231
when people
criticize his food.

08:15.231 --> 08:17.264
But, you know, I think
he actually reacted

08:17.264 --> 08:18.931
to Chef Ramsay's criticisms

08:18.931 --> 08:19.764
the same way he reacts

08:19.764 --> 08:21.264
to a lot
of the guests' criticisms--

08:21.264 --> 08:23.064
like maybe it's not
necessarily that important,

08:23.064 --> 08:24.131
'cause he's right.

08:26.898 --> 08:27.731
Hello.
hello.

08:27.731 --> 08:28.764
How are you?

08:28.764 --> 08:30.000
Very well.
I'm Leslie Bazzini.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.231
Very well.
I'm Leslie Bazzini.

08:30.231 --> 08:31.798
Nice to see you, love.
Nice to see you.

08:31.798 --> 08:32.998
Likewise.
Thank you for coming.

08:32.998 --> 08:34.731
Not at all.
We really appreciate
your help.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.331
It means a lot to us
that you're here.

08:36.331 --> 08:37.964
I don't want to get emotional,
but thank you.

08:37.964 --> 08:39.464
Very happy to be here,
and, uh...

08:39.464 --> 08:40.798
Can I give you a hug?

08:40.798 --> 08:41.931
Of course you can
have a hug.

08:41.931 --> 08:43.631
Thank you.
There we are.

08:44.731 --> 08:46.764
Here is someone
who has the ability

08:46.764 --> 08:47.898
to help us.

08:47.898 --> 08:49.764
And, um, he's going to.

08:49.764 --> 08:52.164
You know,
that's a miracle.

08:52.164 --> 08:53.331
Okay, great, well,

08:53.331 --> 08:54.431
I'm gonna finish my lunch.

08:54.431 --> 08:55.664
Yes, absolutely.
Thank you.

08:55.664 --> 08:56.931
And thank you.
Hi, Alex.

08:56.931 --> 08:58.164
Hello.
Lovely, thank you.

08:58.164 --> 09:00.000
Here we are. Okay, that
is our mushroom risotto.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.798
Here we are. Okay, that
is our mushroom risotto.

09:00.798 --> 09:02.298
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

09:02.298 --> 09:03.298
Okay.

09:04.464 --> 09:07.164
Damn.
Is that normal?

09:07.164 --> 09:09.664
The amazing Bazzini's
risotto.

09:09.664 --> 09:10.898
Whoo-hoo!

09:10.898 --> 09:11.964
Wow, that's extraordinary,
no?

09:11.964 --> 09:13.831
Doesn't even move.

09:13.831 --> 09:16.798
Well, maybe that'd
look better up there.

09:18.064 --> 09:20.098
Yeah.

09:20.098 --> 09:21.798
It fits the colors.

09:21.798 --> 09:22.831
Come on.

09:25.131 --> 09:27.131
Ugh.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.431
What a mess.

09:28.431 --> 09:30.000
I'm absolutely disgusted.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.464
I'm absolutely disgusted.

09:30.464 --> 09:33.498
So...you don't
look too impressed.

09:33.498 --> 09:35.264
It just tastes of mush.

09:35.264 --> 09:37.331
Thank you,Alex.
Oh, yeah.
My pleasure.

09:37.331 --> 09:39.398
I'll bring you
some tilapia next.

09:39.398 --> 09:41.564
Nah, he doesn't like that.

09:41.564 --> 09:42.564
He doesn't like it?

09:42.564 --> 09:43.798
Too mushy.

09:43.798 --> 09:45.264
There is a classic,
you know, way to do it,

09:45.264 --> 09:47.564
but some people around here
just don't like it that way.

09:47.564 --> 09:49.998
My ego's not here
to hear that Gordon Ramsay

09:49.998 --> 09:51.898
loved the dishes
or didn't like the dishes.

09:51.898 --> 09:53.398
I'm not concerned about that.

09:53.398 --> 09:55.064
I'm concerned
about what I do

09:55.064 --> 09:57.098
and how--what--
the product that I put out.

09:57.098 --> 09:58.564
It's all yours, Alex.

09:58.564 --> 09:59.998
All right, here we go.

09:59.998 --> 10:00.000
Thank you.
Almond-crusted tilapia.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.731
Thank you.
Almond-crusted tilapia.

10:02.731 --> 10:03.831
Jasmine rice
with some pepper.

10:03.831 --> 10:05.931
Hopefully you enjoy it.

10:05.931 --> 10:08.798
Wow.

10:08.798 --> 10:09.831
Look at that.

10:09.831 --> 10:11.098
A boob, huh?

10:11.098 --> 10:12.664
I love the Jasmine rice.

10:12.664 --> 10:14.231
He has to like
the Jasmine rice.

10:14.231 --> 10:16.398
Hmm.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.431
It's just so bland.

10:18.431 --> 10:20.664
Honestly, I mean,
it's just...

10:20.664 --> 10:22.598
Greasy, bland, and...

10:22.598 --> 10:24.798
You cut into the fish,
and it's just mush.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.331
How is the tilapia
coming along?

10:26.331 --> 10:28.398
We making some
forward progress here?

10:28.398 --> 10:29.831
Yeah, no, I'm--
do you know what?

10:29.831 --> 10:30.000
I'm, uh--
I'm still hungry.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.498
I'm, uh--
I'm still hungry.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.798
Do you have something
in mind?

10:32.798 --> 10:35.131
Any desserts?

10:35.131 --> 10:36.731
Certainly--Sharyn, our
dessert chef, makes everything.

10:36.731 --> 10:38.798
Good.
I got a carrot cake.

10:38.798 --> 10:39.898
Oh, wow.
Should be
a New York cheesecake.

10:39.898 --> 10:41.331
I'll have a little slice
of the cheesecake

10:41.331 --> 10:42.331
and the carrot cake.

10:42.331 --> 10:43.831
Done.
Please.

10:43.831 --> 10:45.964
Yes, cheesecake,
carrot cake.

10:45.964 --> 10:47.131
Tilapia's a no-go.

10:47.131 --> 10:48.264
Fish was bland.

10:48.264 --> 10:49.898
Watery.
Fish was bland?

10:49.898 --> 10:51.264
Again,
we're kind of like--

10:51.264 --> 10:52.798
we have an older
clientele here.

10:52.798 --> 10:54.998
They like
not-too-assertive things.

10:54.998 --> 10:56.498
Right.

10:56.498 --> 10:57.831
How could I think
that Paul did a good job?

10:57.831 --> 10:59.498
You know,
if he did a good job,

10:59.498 --> 11:00.000
Chef Ramsay would have
said the food was great.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.231
Chef Ramsay would have
said the food was great.

11:01.231 --> 11:02.464
You know,
he didn't say that,

11:02.464 --> 11:03.731
so Paul didn't do
a good job.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.631
We'll start right here
with the carrot cake.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.164
Wow. All homemade?
Yes, absolutely.

11:07.164 --> 11:08.731
Thank you.

11:08.731 --> 11:10.664
Hey.

11:10.664 --> 11:12.631
Gordon's eating
your carrot cake right now,

11:12.631 --> 11:14.631
as we speak.

11:14.631 --> 11:16.764
Ohh.
Oy vey.

11:16.764 --> 11:19.498
The last thing
that people eat is dessert.

11:19.498 --> 11:20.931
And if the dessert sucks,

11:20.931 --> 11:22.331
that's bad!

11:25.264 --> 11:26.964
Hey!

11:26.964 --> 11:28.064
Bloody hell!

11:28.064 --> 11:29.231
You scared me.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.000
Don't come round
the corner like that.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.731
Don't come round
the corner like that.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.331
Sharyn.
Mwah!

11:32.331 --> 11:34.764
Sharyn, first of all,
that is delicious.

11:34.764 --> 11:36.164
Awesome.
Whose recipe is that?

11:36.164 --> 11:37.598
Mine.
Can I have it?

11:37.598 --> 11:39.631
For a price,
everything for a price.

11:39.631 --> 11:40.931
Yeah, I'm glad
you said that.

11:40.931 --> 11:42.131
That's made with passion.

11:42.131 --> 11:43.398
As much as you have.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.464
You make love to that
carrot cake, don't you?

11:45.464 --> 11:48.098
Well, I'm getting divorced,
so it's the cake or, uh--

11:48.098 --> 11:49.498
I'll go for the cake.

11:49.498 --> 11:50.798
Hope he likes it.

11:50.798 --> 11:52.631
Sharyn's gonna be devastated
if he hates it.

11:52.631 --> 11:53.764
I hate it.

11:53.764 --> 11:55.431
I'm so glad
you liked it.

11:55.431 --> 11:57.431
Honestly, I felt like I was
at a  wake at funeral.

11:57.431 --> 11:58.764
And all of a sudden,
the carrot cakes arrive

11:58.764 --> 12:00.000
and whoof--
I'm back up there.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.664
and whoof--
I'm back up there.

12:00.664 --> 12:03.098
I love you!

12:04.998 --> 12:06.764
Although dessert
left Chef Ramsay

12:06.764 --> 12:07.731
with a good taste
in his mouth,

12:07.731 --> 12:10.898
it still doesn't erase
the bad taste

12:10.898 --> 12:11.898
of the rest of the meal.

12:11.898 --> 12:12.831
Let's talk
about the food.

12:12.831 --> 12:14.064
Dessert.
Let's go backwards.

12:14.064 --> 12:15.631
Okay.
Okay.

12:15.631 --> 12:16.798
That was delicious.

12:16.798 --> 12:17.964
Good.
Glad you enjoyed it.

12:17.964 --> 12:19.131
Really good.
Yay, Sharyn.

12:19.131 --> 12:20.998
great way to finish,

12:20.998 --> 12:23.464
Clearly, but I certainly
didn't start off like that.

12:25.464 --> 12:26.764
I said to you,
"Show me your best.

12:26.764 --> 12:28.164
Give to me big-time."

12:28.164 --> 12:30.000
The risotto
was embarrassing.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.431
The risotto
was embarrassing.

12:32.431 --> 12:33.664
Paul, it tasted
the way it looked...

12:33.664 --> 12:35.331
Damn.
Is that normal?

12:35.331 --> 12:37.731
Bland, mushy,

12:37.731 --> 12:38.898
and it looked atrocious.

12:38.898 --> 12:41.398
Honestly, it was
disgusting.

12:41.398 --> 12:44.731
The chicken--how many days
were you baking that for?

12:44.731 --> 12:46.498
Seriously, I mean,
you may laugh,

12:46.498 --> 12:47.798
but it's not funny.

12:47.798 --> 12:49.564
Honestly, I thought
I'd lost my tooth.

12:49.564 --> 12:50.631
It was so crunchy
on the outside...

12:52.098 --> 12:53.731
Dry in the middle.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.298
It wasn't intended to be dry
or to be overcooked.

12:56.298 --> 12:57.898
You sent it out.
I know that.

12:57.898 --> 12:59.431
That's the way you
normally cook it--overdone?

12:59.431 --> 13:00.000
I certainly don't think
that I cook food overdone.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.498
I certainly don't think
that I cook food overdone.

13:01.498 --> 13:03.564
Okay, risotto overcooked.

13:03.564 --> 13:04.764
Chicken overcooked.

13:04.764 --> 13:07.831
You certainly did for me.

13:07.831 --> 13:09.964
Okay, I-I need to get
some fresh air.

13:09.964 --> 13:12.398
I'm gonna come back later.
I'm here tonight.

13:12.398 --> 13:13.664
Show it to me.
Okay.

13:13.664 --> 13:15.598
Hopefully this time
with a little bit more effort.

13:15.598 --> 13:16.798
Okay.

13:18.664 --> 13:20.731
Did you think
that he was gonna like it?

13:21.898 --> 13:25.498
It angers me
that Paul has given up,

13:25.498 --> 13:27.398
because I haven't given up.

13:27.398 --> 13:28.731
You're. Like...

13:28.731 --> 13:29.731
Dead.

13:29.731 --> 13:30.000
I want the nightmare
to be over.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.931
I want the nightmare
to be over.

13:32.931 --> 13:35.931
Coming up, a shocking
dinner service,

13:35.931 --> 13:37.898
Where Paul loses control
of the kitchen...

13:37.898 --> 13:39.764
I don't have
all the tickets memorized!

13:39.764 --> 13:40.831
And his mind.

13:40.831 --> 13:42.798
That's why
you have a ticket!

13:42.798 --> 13:44.331
He ends up taking
his frustration out

13:44.331 --> 13:45.831
On his staff.

13:45.831 --> 13:46.831
What's with
the  sarcasm?

13:46.831 --> 13:48.831
What the
do you want from me?

13:48.831 --> 13:49.731
And on top of that,

13:49.731 --> 13:51.831
His wife no longer
believes in him.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.764
Never saw anything
like that in my life.

13:53.764 --> 13:54.964
Can Chef Ramsay

13:54.964 --> 13:56.964
Make a last-ditch effort
to save Paul...

13:56.964 --> 13:58.964
Have some fire!
I'm miserable.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.000
Why?

14:00.000 --> 14:00.231
Why?

14:00.231 --> 14:01.798
From himself?

14:04.664 --> 14:06.664
I never thought in a million
years this could happen.

14:06.664 --> 14:09.431
That's next
on Kitchen Nightmares.

14:17.764 --> 14:20.097
This former Manhattan star chef

14:20.097 --> 14:22.064
failed to impress
Chef Ramsay at lunch.

14:22.064 --> 14:24.331
Now it's time
for Chef Ramsay to see

14:24.331 --> 14:27.231
how Paul handles the customers
of Ridgewood, New Jersey,

14:27.231 --> 14:28.997
in a dinner service.

14:28.997 --> 14:30.664
All right, guys,
we got to get ready.

14:30.664 --> 14:32.731
I hope Paul could
get his  together.

14:32.731 --> 14:35.531
The food is there.
The capability is there.

14:35.531 --> 14:37.064
He just has to do it.

14:37.064 --> 14:39.397
It's like you have to
or get off the pot.

14:39.397 --> 14:40.531
Hello, good evening.

14:40.531 --> 14:41.384
Can I take your wine?
You may.

14:41.384 --> 14:41.931
Can I take your wine?
You may.

14:41.931 --> 14:44.197
Let me just...

14:44.197 --> 14:46.164
There you go.
Okay, enjoy.

14:46.164 --> 14:47.231
And this is...
Al.

14:47.231 --> 14:48.231
Al, good to see you.

14:48.231 --> 14:49.497
Your sous chef, right?

14:49.497 --> 14:50.664
Yes.

14:50.664 --> 14:51.831
This kitchen's like
a  shoe box in here.

14:51.831 --> 14:53.564
Yeah, I know.
Holy crap.

14:53.564 --> 14:55.431
I think Chef Ramsay
doesn't realize

14:55.431 --> 14:57.664
that I worked with a lot
of very well-known chefs.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.031
It's not intimidating.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.497
I have the talent,
the desire,

15:00.497 --> 15:02.397
and I definitely
can do the job.

15:02.397 --> 15:05.097
Crab cakes across the board
except for this risotto.

15:05.097 --> 15:06.864
You smell good.

15:08.397 --> 15:10.531
Your aftershave.
Sharyn, are you
hitting on me?

15:10.531 --> 15:11.384
No, I like
the aftershave.

15:11.384 --> 15:11.997
No, I like
the aftershave.

15:11.997 --> 15:14.597
It smells nice.
Oop.

15:14.597 --> 15:15.997
No, I'm not.

15:15.997 --> 15:17.564
Gordon is adorable.

15:17.564 --> 15:20.564
And, of course,
he's got quite the butt.

15:23.331 --> 15:24.997
I'm sorry.

15:24.997 --> 15:26.664
Order in!

15:26.664 --> 15:27.564
The crab cakes are ready.

15:27.564 --> 15:29.164
Okay, thank you.

15:29.164 --> 15:32.731
How come
they're cooked already?

15:32.731 --> 15:35.831
They're pre-seared.

15:35.831 --> 15:37.897
You sear a crab cake?
No.

15:37.897 --> 15:38.897
We pre-sear
the crab cake,

15:38.897 --> 15:40.264
and then it goes
into the oven.

15:40.264 --> 15:41.384
Now, hold on a minute.

15:41.384 --> 15:41.397
Now, hold on a minute.

15:41.397 --> 15:42.664
Why wouldn't you
do that to order?

15:42.664 --> 15:45.097
For--to expedite it
out a little bit faster.

15:45.097 --> 15:47.431
Well, surely, it'll take
longer to get...

15:47.431 --> 15:48.731
Yes?
Hotter once
already cooked.

15:48.731 --> 15:49.864
Yes.

15:49.864 --> 15:51.597
Is it me, or does that
not make sense?

15:51.597 --> 15:53.531
It doesn't make sense.
It doesn't make sense.

15:56.464 --> 15:58.264
Here is your
crab cake, sir.

15:58.264 --> 16:00.131
May I get you
any fresh pepper on that?

16:00.131 --> 16:01.664
No, thank you.
no?

16:01.664 --> 16:02.864
How strange.

16:02.864 --> 16:04.431
How are they doing
on the kitchen?

16:04.431 --> 16:06.064
There's a bucket

16:06.064 --> 16:08.497
of crab cakes
that just go into the oven

16:08.497 --> 16:10.097
to be reheated.

16:10.097 --> 16:11.384
But they were seared off,
like, yesterday.

16:11.384 --> 16:12.597
But they were seared off,
like, yesterday.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.564
Did you know they were
done the day before?

16:14.564 --> 16:16.831
Of course not. I thought
everything was fresh...

16:16.831 --> 16:18.264
Everything.

16:19.597 --> 16:21.331
I feel like Paul

16:21.331 --> 16:23.164
is losing his artistry,

16:23.164 --> 16:24.397
and that he doesn't care.

16:24.397 --> 16:25.731
It's not affecting him.

16:25.731 --> 16:29.097
It not only pains me.
It angers me, quite frankly.

16:29.097 --> 16:30.497
I mean,
that's just not okay.

16:30.497 --> 16:32.664
It's all burned
on the side.

16:32.664 --> 16:34.531
All I can taste
is the food is burned.

16:34.531 --> 16:37.531
Is it really?
Yeah,
I don't like it.

16:37.531 --> 16:40.431
Is everything okay
with your crab cake, sir?

16:40.431 --> 16:41.384
Okay, yeah, let me get that
back to you, no problem.

16:41.384 --> 16:42.664
Okay, yeah, let me get that
back to you, no problem.

16:45.497 --> 16:47.431
I need another crab cake
on the fly.

16:47.431 --> 16:48.831
What did they say?
It was burnt.

16:48.831 --> 16:51.397
Burnt? Yeah, there's two more
that are about to go out.

16:51.397 --> 16:52.564
Please tell me
you're not gonna serve them.

16:52.564 --> 16:54.464
No, I'm not, Chef.

16:54.464 --> 16:55.864
We had issues
with the crab cakes tonight.

16:55.864 --> 16:56.931
It's not the right way
to do it.

16:56.931 --> 16:58.097
It should be done
a different way.

16:58.097 --> 16:59.531
And I know how to do it
a different way.

16:59.531 --> 17:00.597
That's not how it's done.

17:00.597 --> 17:02.531
That is disgusting.
Yes, it is.

17:02.531 --> 17:03.897
Do something about it,
please, Paul.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.231
In the garbage.

17:05.231 --> 17:07.597
This is not a reflection
of the way

17:07.597 --> 17:11.164
that I want things
to be, okay?

17:11.164 --> 17:11.384
So how we doing
back there--all right?

17:11.384 --> 17:13.531
So how we doing
back there--all right?

17:13.531 --> 17:15.397
I'll go check for you.

17:15.397 --> 17:16.497
It's an hour
into dinner service,

17:16.497 --> 17:18.564
And very little food
has left the kitchen.

17:22.364 --> 17:24.597
In order to get an accurate
picture of the slowdown...

17:24.597 --> 17:26.031
That's not ready?

17:26.031 --> 17:27.697
There's no potatoes
on it, honey, okay?

17:27.697 --> 17:29.531
Chef Ramsay times
how long cooked food

17:29.531 --> 17:31.597
Sits at the pass.

17:35.897 --> 17:37.364
I think I ate, like,
nine loaves of bread

17:37.364 --> 17:38.997
just sitting here
waiting for our food.

17:38.997 --> 17:40.564
Okay, four minutes.

17:40.564 --> 17:41.384
That's sat there--
and the steak.

17:41.384 --> 17:43.897
That's sat there--
and the steak.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.664
Paul, that's still there.

17:45.664 --> 17:48.497
Yes, I'm working on everything.
Everything is working.

17:48.497 --> 17:49.764
Hey, let me bring
some food out there.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.531
I--yeah, but...
does she have her...

17:51.531 --> 17:52.531
You...

17:52.531 --> 17:54.464
Paul is communicating,

17:54.464 --> 17:56.097
but most of his communication
is that he can't handle it,

17:56.097 --> 17:57.131
and it's going too fast.

17:57.131 --> 17:59.131
I'm gonna have to leave,
though.

18:01.697 --> 18:02.897
It is, a little bit.

18:02.897 --> 18:04.531
Like, a little--yeah.

18:04.531 --> 18:05.697
Okay, these people
are gonna leave

18:05.697 --> 18:07.097
if I don't
get this one out.

18:07.097 --> 18:09.431
He decides how fast
things come out.

18:09.431 --> 18:11.264
I don't know
why it takes so long.

18:11.264 --> 18:11.384
I just know
it takes so long.

18:11.384 --> 18:12.564
I just know
it takes so long.

18:15.664 --> 18:17.364
Oh...Oh!

18:19.397 --> 18:21.497
Okay, table 32
can now go.

18:21.497 --> 18:22.731
Thank you.
You're welcome.

18:22.731 --> 18:23.931
Finally.
Yes.

18:23.931 --> 18:26.497
And now, after a long wait...

18:27.864 --> 18:29.664
The customers...

18:29.664 --> 18:31.164
Aren't satisfied.

18:31.164 --> 18:33.331
Okay, no problem.
I'll send that back for you.

18:33.331 --> 18:34.764
okay, thank you.
no problem.

18:34.764 --> 18:36.031
- Paul...
- what's wrong?

18:36.031 --> 18:38.264
Uh, it's cold.
Oh, come on.

18:38.264 --> 18:39.564
Almighty.

18:39.564 --> 18:41.384
I have certainly
become annoyed with clients,

18:41.384 --> 18:41.831
I have certainly
become annoyed with clients,

18:41.831 --> 18:42.931
and I feel like, you know,

18:42.931 --> 18:44.531
people that want
to give you criticism,

18:44.531 --> 18:46.031
they just don't know,
like, what you're going through.

18:46.031 --> 18:47.097
And if they just knew,
like, a little bit

18:47.097 --> 18:48.397
of what you were
going through,

18:48.397 --> 18:50.064
they might be a little bit
more compassionate.

18:50.064 --> 18:51.764
But it's not
a compassionate business.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.664
Is this going, Paul?

18:53.664 --> 18:54.964
I'm just worried about food
coming back cold,

18:54.964 --> 18:55.997
and this is sat here.

18:55.997 --> 18:58.297
I was told that
the salads would be ready.

18:58.297 --> 18:59.664
I'm waiting
for the salads.

18:59.664 --> 19:01.064
Take half
of that salad off.

19:01.064 --> 19:02.597
What are you building,
a  Christmas tree?

19:02.597 --> 19:03.664
Half of that--
no, half.

19:03.664 --> 19:04.864
The plates don't look
the way they should

19:04.864 --> 19:06.231
when I don't do them.

19:06.231 --> 19:08.097
Just take half
of the salad off, please.

19:08.097 --> 19:09.564
Follow my directions.
I'm gonna help you, okay?

19:09.564 --> 19:11.384
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here to help you.

19:11.384 --> 19:11.664
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here to help you.

19:11.664 --> 19:12.564
Contrary to what
everybody says,

19:12.564 --> 19:14.597
I do know a few
things.

19:14.597 --> 19:15.697
Oy vey.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.564
Easy to sum up Paul's moods.

19:17.564 --> 19:19.231
If he were a woman,

19:19.231 --> 19:21.864
he would have P.M.S.
24-7, okay?

19:21.864 --> 19:23.531
So let me demo

19:23.531 --> 19:26.231
a chicken milanese
for the 400th  time,

19:26.231 --> 19:28.364
which is nothing more
than chicken and salad,

19:28.364 --> 19:29.931
and my 12-year-old
can  do it.

19:29.931 --> 19:32.431
Yeah, listen.
Don't push it, Paul.

19:32.431 --> 19:33.731
When I don't
put it high enough,

19:33.731 --> 19:35.731
you yell at me that it's
not freakin' high enough.

19:35.731 --> 19:37.564
Why do you have to make it
so difficult for?

19:37.564 --> 19:38.564
Why can't we--
i'm not!

19:38.564 --> 19:40.164
Go, I'm watching!

19:40.164 --> 19:41.384
Why can't we just finish
this chicken milanese

19:41.384 --> 19:41.764
Why can't we just finish
this chicken milanese

19:41.764 --> 19:44.331
and make this particular
chicken milanese a right one?

19:44.331 --> 19:45.597
Not talking
about yesterday,

19:45.597 --> 19:47.031
not talking
about next month,

19:47.031 --> 19:48.564
but what's with
the  sarcasm?

19:48.564 --> 19:50.364
Well, I can't help it
if you tell me

19:50.364 --> 19:52.831
to do it one  way,
then you change it!

19:52.831 --> 19:54.597
What the
do you want from me?

19:54.597 --> 19:55.864
Changing it right!

19:55.864 --> 19:57.897
Well, you told me
the first  time!

19:57.897 --> 20:00.164
me.

20:07.531 --> 20:09.031
Why do you have to make it
so difficult for?

20:09.031 --> 20:10.598
The battle to get
food out tonight

20:10.598 --> 20:12.332
has resulted
in a war in the kitchen.

20:12.332 --> 20:14.032
But what's with
the  sarcasm?

20:14.032 --> 20:15.932
What the
do you want from me?

20:15.932 --> 20:18.932
And the impact is being felt
in the dining room.

20:18.932 --> 20:20.765
Get my food, now!

20:20.765 --> 20:22.166
Who's waiting
on what?

20:22.166 --> 20:23.199
Um...

20:23.199 --> 20:25.766
34 has been waiting
for, like, an hour.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.399
This big table behind me--
what are they waiting on?

20:27.399 --> 20:28.666
Whose table is that?
Julie's.

20:28.666 --> 20:29.832
How long have they been
waiting on entrees?

20:29.832 --> 20:31.699
Over an hour.
I don't know.

20:31.699 --> 20:33.332
Yeah, it's over an hour.
This is not normal, surely.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.999
No.
No.

20:34.999 --> 20:35.404
Tonight is the worst dinner
service that I have ever seen.

20:35.404 --> 20:37.499
Tonight is the worst dinner
service that I have ever seen.

20:37.499 --> 20:40.099
I mean, I have never
experienced anything like this

20:40.099 --> 20:41.666
in my life.

20:41.666 --> 20:43.832
Okay. Uh, Paul.
Yes, Chef?

20:43.832 --> 20:44.932
I don't know
what's happened,

20:44.932 --> 20:47.932
but the level of frustration
out there

20:47.932 --> 20:49.166
is intense.
okay.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.166
So...Stop.

20:52.132 --> 20:53.432
We can't continue
like this.

20:53.432 --> 20:56.699
stop it.

20:56.699 --> 20:58.432
Will you apologize to
the tables, please, Rebecca?

21:00.666 --> 21:02.732
What a freakin' disaster.

21:02.732 --> 21:03.732
Bad, I know.

21:03.732 --> 21:05.032
It was a terrible night.

21:05.032 --> 21:05.404
We had people not get food
when tickets were here.

21:05.404 --> 21:07.666
We had people not get food
when tickets were here.

21:07.666 --> 21:09.532
We failed, and it's
my responsibility.

21:09.532 --> 21:10.832
Sorry, my friends.

21:10.832 --> 21:12.999
The kitchen
has been shut down.

21:12.999 --> 21:15.699
I'm so sorry. I've never had
to do this before.

21:18.366 --> 21:19.832
Never saw anything
like that in my life.

21:19.832 --> 21:20.899
I understand that.

21:20.899 --> 21:22.099
Do you think
that I like this?

21:22.099 --> 21:23.499
Do you think that I want it
to be like this?

21:23.499 --> 21:24.499
I don't.

21:24.499 --> 21:25.532
But...
But what?

21:25.532 --> 21:26.666
I'm one person
with two hands.

21:26.666 --> 21:27.732
Paul, you don't--

21:27.732 --> 21:29.199
please don't start
with excuses.

21:29.199 --> 21:30.699
That's not gonna help.

21:30.699 --> 21:33.066
Paul had a horrible night,
100% off his game,

21:33.066 --> 21:35.404
And I think gave up
before he even got started.

21:35.404 --> 21:35.532
And I think gave up
before he even got started.

21:35.532 --> 21:37.066
Well, people
hated the food.

21:37.066 --> 21:39.332
Well, that's not
what we got back here.

21:40.332 --> 21:41.366
I am very angry,

21:41.366 --> 21:42.899
saying that someone
liked something.

21:42.899 --> 21:44.699
50 people didn't like it.
Open your eyes.

21:44.699 --> 21:46.666
I have nothing else
to say to you.

21:49.632 --> 21:52.332
Equally as miserable
as tonight's dinner service

21:52.332 --> 21:53.666
Was Paul's attitude,

21:53.666 --> 21:56.132
and Chef Ramsay
wants to know why.

21:56.132 --> 21:58.999
Tonight showed me
that you hated cooking.

21:58.999 --> 22:01.099
I cannot ignite
that little button.

22:01.099 --> 22:02.766
I need to see it
from you!

22:02.766 --> 22:03.832
Chef, I feel awful.

22:03.832 --> 22:05.404
This is not the way
that I want to work

22:05.404 --> 22:06.166
This is not the way
that I want to work

22:06.166 --> 22:09.166
or the way that
I know that I can work.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.666
Why are you doing it
to yourself?
I--I--

22:11.666 --> 22:14.166
Why?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.832
Like--
You've got
to give me the answer,

22:15.832 --> 22:17.566
because I can't
start helping

22:17.566 --> 22:18.699
until you tell me.

22:18.699 --> 22:19.766
But, I mean--

22:19.766 --> 22:21.166
No one's asking you
to rant and rave!

22:21.166 --> 22:24.532
I'm just asking you
to have some fire!

22:24.532 --> 22:25.932
It's not normal
for a guy

22:25.932 --> 22:27.699
that's been cooking
for 20-years-plus

22:27.699 --> 22:29.666
to stand there
with no feel or passion

22:29.666 --> 22:30.766
and say  like that

22:30.766 --> 22:33.066
as if it's just
going over your head!

22:33.066 --> 22:35.404
Whether you like it or not,
you have given up.

22:35.404 --> 22:35.866
Whether you like it or not,
you have given up.

22:40.999 --> 22:43.166
Your whole family
is on the line here.

22:43.166 --> 22:44.566
Do you know
how hard it is

22:44.566 --> 22:48.266
to look at my kids
when I go home at night?

22:48.266 --> 22:52.199
Or my wife?

22:52.199 --> 22:54.832
It's not easy, okay?

22:54.832 --> 22:57.166
It's not supposed
to be easy.

22:57.166 --> 22:59.032
I don't care
if it's not easy.

22:59.032 --> 23:00.532
I just want it
to be better.

23:00.532 --> 23:01.832
Then don't stop trying.

23:07.932 --> 23:08.932
Think I'm happy?

23:08.932 --> 23:10.332
I'm miserable.

23:10.332 --> 23:11.566
I don't want to get
out of bed in the morning.

23:11.566 --> 23:12.599
I want to stay in bed.

23:16.899 --> 23:18.032
Okay, listen,

23:18.032 --> 23:20.099
I'm committed
to helping you.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.399
And I'm not leaving
this place until it's set.

23:22.399 --> 23:24.866
We are gonna work
at this together,

23:24.866 --> 23:26.599
at turning this around.

23:26.599 --> 23:28.999
Tomorrow I want you
at your best.

23:28.999 --> 23:30.399
Yes?
Yes.

23:30.399 --> 23:31.666
Get some sleep.
Thank you.

23:31.666 --> 23:33.499
Good night.
Good night.

23:43.032 --> 23:45.032
After an emotionally
draining night,

23:45.032 --> 23:46.699
Chef Ramsay
has a task in mind

23:46.699 --> 23:49.766
to help ignite Paul's passion
in the kitchen.

23:49.766 --> 23:50.866
good morning.

23:50.866 --> 23:52.299
Hello.

23:52.299 --> 23:53.866
New day,
new attitude.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.332
New start.

23:55.332 --> 23:56.866
So...

23:56.866 --> 23:58.832
Last night,
it took us an hour,

23:58.832 --> 24:00.199
on average,

24:00.199 --> 24:01.832
to get appetizers out.

24:01.832 --> 24:03.499
So here's what
we're doing today.

24:03.499 --> 24:05.332
I want you to get used
to the time pressure.

24:05.332 --> 24:05.404
See what I'm saying?

24:05.404 --> 24:06.366
See what I'm saying?

24:06.366 --> 24:07.832
Like, sort of, you know,
yeah.

24:07.832 --> 24:09.066
Kick-starting
the  car again.

24:09.066 --> 24:10.832
You know,
a new battery in it.

24:10.832 --> 24:12.432
You've got 15 minutes...

24:12.432 --> 24:13.999
Yep.
from now...

24:13.999 --> 24:15.666
To cook me...
Oh, God.

24:15.666 --> 24:17.866
A stunning pasta dish.
Off you go.

24:17.866 --> 24:19.366
Trying to kill me.

24:19.366 --> 24:20.866
You can do it, hon.
15 minutes!

24:20.866 --> 24:22.399
Go, Paul!
Go, Paul!

24:22.399 --> 24:24.999
In order for Paul
to impress Chef Ramsay,

24:24.999 --> 24:27.499
This chef is making fresh pasta
for the first time

24:27.499 --> 24:29.432
in five years.

24:29.432 --> 24:32.599
I just want to be able to do
what I know how to do--

24:32.599 --> 24:33.932
you know, just cook
from the heart

24:33.932 --> 24:35.404
and get back to raising
the bar for myself.

24:35.404 --> 24:36.099
and get back to raising
the bar for myself.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.199
What are you gonna make?

24:37.199 --> 24:38.866
I'm just getting
the lay of the land.

24:38.866 --> 24:39.899
You have 14 minutes.

24:39.899 --> 24:41.599
And the clock is ticking,
and it's just,

24:41.599 --> 24:43.866
you know, like, everything
around me was just turned off.

24:43.866 --> 24:45.232
Like, I wasn't
hearing or seeing

24:45.232 --> 24:46.599
or feeling
or worrying.

24:46.599 --> 24:48.432
It was just, you know--
I was living in the moment.

24:51.966 --> 24:53.866
Ten minutes, babe.
He's sitting. He's ready.

24:53.866 --> 24:55.632
He's waiting to be served.

24:55.632 --> 24:58.966
You can totally, totally wow him
right now, please.

24:58.966 --> 25:00.966
I was watching
everything that he did,

25:00.966 --> 25:02.532
and I was definitely afraid

25:02.532 --> 25:04.032
that Chef Ramsay
wasn't going to like it

25:04.032 --> 25:05.332
and what that would mean.

25:05.332 --> 25:05.404
Can I carry it out?
I'll carry it out.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.332
Can I carry it out?
I'll carry it out.

25:07.332 --> 25:08.432
You sure you want
to do that?

25:08.432 --> 25:09.766
Yes.
all right.

25:11.332 --> 25:12.532
Hey.
Here we go.

25:12.532 --> 25:13.566
Chef.
Thank you.

25:13.566 --> 25:14.566
You're welcome.

25:14.566 --> 25:16.032
We have a capellini pasta

25:16.032 --> 25:18.732
with a chunky
puttanesca sauce

25:18.732 --> 25:20.199
and some rock shrimp.
lovely.

25:20.199 --> 25:21.999
Well, I used to be
a good chef.

25:21.999 --> 25:23.432
I think I'm still
a good chef.

25:23.432 --> 25:24.932
I would just want him
to be able to recognize

25:24.932 --> 25:28.199
that there was a passion
that went into making this.

25:44.066 --> 25:46.332
Chef Ramsay has put Paul's
passion for cooking to the test.

25:46.332 --> 25:47.932
We have a capellini pasta

25:47.932 --> 25:50.166
with a puttanesca sauce.
lovely.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.932
Now it's time to find out
if he passed.

25:52.932 --> 25:54.066
I would hope that Chef Ramsay

25:54.066 --> 25:55.666
Would recognize that,
you know,

25:55.666 --> 25:57.099
some love went
into making this dish.

25:57.099 --> 25:59.666
Will it be to his taste?

25:59.666 --> 26:01.924
Who knows?

26:01.924 --> 26:03.290
Mmm.

26:03.290 --> 26:05.123
That's nice.

26:05.689 --> 26:07.356
Capellini
is cooked perfectly.

26:07.356 --> 26:08.356
Thank you.

26:08.356 --> 26:09.689
It just felt good

26:09.689 --> 26:11.322
to just have a really positive
comment from Chef Ramsay.

26:11.322 --> 26:11.407
I really needed that lift.

26:11.407 --> 26:12.689
I really needed that lift.

26:12.689 --> 26:14.522
What does pasta mean
to you?

26:14.522 --> 26:15.989
To me, it's like bread.
It's staff of life.

26:15.989 --> 26:17.322
Mm-hmm.
pasta can be anything.

26:17.322 --> 26:18.856
You can go through
all different flavors,

26:18.856 --> 26:20.189
textures, proteins, colors.

26:20.189 --> 26:21.856
Yeah.
you can have dried pasta,
fresh pasta.

26:21.856 --> 26:23.522
It's a blank canvas,
you know.

26:23.522 --> 26:25.189
It's just something
for the artist to paint.

26:25.189 --> 26:27.256
You're sounding more exciting
in the last two minutes

26:27.256 --> 26:29.322
talking about pasta
than you have done

26:29.322 --> 26:30.689
since I've met you.

26:30.689 --> 26:31.822
It was the old Paul.

26:31.822 --> 26:33.522
He was excited.
He was energized.

26:33.522 --> 26:34.689
It was the man
that I married.

26:34.689 --> 26:36.322
And it's really weird,
isn't it?

26:36.322 --> 26:38.722
It takes something like
a pasta dish to sort of

26:38.722 --> 26:40.589
ignite how you feel
about it.

26:40.589 --> 26:41.407
Absolutely.

26:41.407 --> 26:41.622
Absolutely.

26:41.622 --> 26:43.756
Today, at this moment,

26:43.756 --> 26:47.022
I know that, like,
the healing process has begun.

26:50.256 --> 26:53.756
Of hope this morning,

26:53.756 --> 26:55.589
Chef Ramsay
wants to try an experiment.

26:55.589 --> 26:57.489
Time for some
sophisticated marketing.

26:57.489 --> 27:00.689
He wants to take advantage
of the Ridgewood foot traffic

27:00.689 --> 27:01.989
And test Paul's speed
in the kitchen.

27:01.989 --> 27:03.556
How are you?

27:03.556 --> 27:04.922
So for the first time
in four years,

27:04.922 --> 27:07.156
Bazzini's is open for lunch.

27:07.156 --> 27:08.256
Having lunch today?

27:08.256 --> 27:09.722
Fabulous lunch menu,
around the corner.

27:09.722 --> 27:11.056
Bazzini's, $15.

27:11.056 --> 27:11.407
Soup, salad,
and the most amazing pasta.

27:11.407 --> 27:12.322
Soup, salad,
and the most amazing pasta.

27:12.322 --> 27:13.656
Wonderful.
Thank you so much.

27:15.689 --> 27:17.556
Now Chef Ramsay only has
one thing left to do--

27:17.556 --> 27:18.822
Tell the owners.

27:18.822 --> 27:20.256
So here's what
we're doing today.

27:20.256 --> 27:21.489
We're gonna serve

27:21.489 --> 27:24.556
the most amazing
two-course lunch.

27:24.556 --> 27:25.722
That's right.

27:25.722 --> 27:27.756
This is not a formal,
long-winded,

27:27.756 --> 27:30.089
three-hour ordeal.

27:30.089 --> 27:33.722
This is a really nice,
easy, quick, vibrant lunch.

27:33.722 --> 27:35.189
I'm nervous, but, you know,

27:35.189 --> 27:36.689
If this is what we're gonna do
today, fantastic.

27:36.689 --> 27:37.989
Oh, great.
You know, terrific.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.689
You and I in the kitchen.
Great.

27:39.689 --> 27:41.289
I'm your sous chef.
Okay, fantastic.

27:41.289 --> 27:41.407
I'm your bitch.

27:41.407 --> 27:42.989
I'm your bitch.

27:42.989 --> 27:44.089
Okay.

27:44.089 --> 27:45.356
Ladies, you've both got

27:45.356 --> 27:46.589
great personalities.

27:46.589 --> 27:48.489
So both of you are running
the front of house.

27:48.489 --> 27:51.489
I don't know anything
about the front of the house.

27:51.489 --> 27:53.956
I don't care
about the front of the house.

27:53.956 --> 27:55.756
I just want to do my job.

27:55.756 --> 27:57.689
Great service,
great food, in and out.

27:59.956 --> 28:02.022
Hello. Welcome.

28:02.022 --> 28:03.722
Ah, follow me, please.

28:03.722 --> 28:05.722
Chef Ramsay is hoping
today's lunch

28:05.722 --> 28:07.056
Will show Paul and Leslie

28:07.056 --> 28:09.389
the opportunity they are not
taking advantage of.

28:09.389 --> 28:10.422
I'll have
the pasta special.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.407
The fontina pasta.

28:11.407 --> 28:12.256
The fontina pasta.

28:12.256 --> 28:14.689
And the power
of serving fresh pasta.

28:14.689 --> 28:16.856
Soup, three.
Panzanella, two.

28:16.856 --> 28:18.589
Okay, good.
Let's go.

28:20.656 --> 28:22.589
Two soups are going
in the window, Chef,

28:22.589 --> 28:24.089
To go up with two salads.

28:24.089 --> 28:25.089
Salads 30 seconds, Paul.

28:25.089 --> 28:26.522
Very good.
Thank you.

28:26.522 --> 28:27.589
Don't forget,
speed today, yes?

28:27.589 --> 28:29.389
Yep.
Order in.

28:29.389 --> 28:30.489
One soup,
two orichiette.

28:30.489 --> 28:31.756
Two panzanella.

28:31.756 --> 28:33.922
Three vegetable orichiette,
three regular orichiette.

28:33.922 --> 28:34.922
Very good.

28:35.989 --> 28:37.556
Uhh!

28:37.556 --> 28:39.156
Waitressing is totally
not my thing.

28:39.156 --> 28:40.622
I'll be right
with you, folks.

28:40.622 --> 28:41.407
You girls okay?

28:41.407 --> 28:41.656
You girls okay?

28:41.656 --> 28:43.122
We're just waiting
on our wine.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.422
Ugh!

28:44.422 --> 28:45.922
Um, garlic--
oh, my pen's not writing.

28:45.922 --> 28:46.956
I'm sorry.

28:46.956 --> 28:48.289
Sharyn and I
are not servers.

28:48.289 --> 28:49.489
We did the best
that we could.

28:49.489 --> 28:50.589
Is everything okay?

28:50.589 --> 28:52.122
We need spoons still.

28:52.122 --> 28:53.456
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

28:53.456 --> 28:56.089
But we forgot that you need
a spoon to eat soup.

28:56.089 --> 28:57.956
Where's the spoons?
Why you asking me?

28:57.956 --> 28:59.656
Ugh! God help me.

29:00.922 --> 29:02.489
Oops.
I'm sorry.

29:02.489 --> 29:03.756
Service!

29:03.756 --> 29:05.822
Can you manage
with that?
Thank you.

29:05.822 --> 29:07.256
That looks great.
Enjoy it.

29:07.256 --> 29:08.489
Next entree is what?

29:08.489 --> 29:10.922
Two orichiettes,
one vegetarian orichiette.

29:10.922 --> 29:11.407
It was great working
with Gordon today.

29:11.407 --> 29:12.689
It was great working
with Gordon today.

29:12.689 --> 29:14.556
You know, we worked together.
We jumped around.

29:14.556 --> 29:16.756
It was good. It was like
a good two-man, you know, vibe.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.256
It felt good, you know?
It felt real good.

29:18.256 --> 29:21.022
With Chef Ramsay and Paul
working together...

29:21.022 --> 29:22.822
You got four veg, Sharyn.
I got five normal, yes?

29:22.822 --> 29:24.756
Four vegetarian
on the way.
Excellent.

29:24.756 --> 29:26.656
Beautifully cooked
fresh pasta

29:26.656 --> 29:28.056
Is flying
out of the kitchen.

29:28.056 --> 29:29.389
Thank you very much.
Enjoy it.

29:29.389 --> 29:30.389
There you go.

29:32.589 --> 29:34.389
Oh, my gosh,
this is so good.

29:34.389 --> 29:36.189
That is, like,
the best pasta I've ever had.

29:36.189 --> 29:37.656
Better than that stuff
your mom makes?

29:37.656 --> 29:39.356
and you're in and out
in no time.

29:39.356 --> 29:40.356
Mm-hmm.

29:40.356 --> 29:41.407
how is it?

29:41.407 --> 29:41.522
how is it?

29:41.522 --> 29:42.822
Very good.
Good.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.256
Phenomenal.
Good, I'm glad.

29:44.256 --> 29:45.822
The kitchen did
everything right today.

29:45.822 --> 29:47.156
That's it.
The board is cleared, yeah?

29:47.156 --> 29:50.256
I don't have any tickets.
Anyone need food?
No food.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.656
I absolutely think lunch

29:51.656 --> 29:53.022
should be an everyday thing
at Bazzini.

29:53.022 --> 29:57.222
I think that today
probably proved that to Paul.

29:57.222 --> 29:58.489
It was a great lunch service.

29:58.489 --> 29:59.689
It was really good.

29:59.689 --> 30:01.856
It was profitable,
and we--we made money.

30:01.856 --> 30:03.856
And the customers were happy,

30:03.856 --> 30:05.156
and it was quick,
and it was easy.

30:05.156 --> 30:06.522
I feel good.

30:09.689 --> 30:11.407
Coming up...

30:11.407 --> 30:11.922
Coming up...

30:11.922 --> 30:13.856
It's relaunch night
at Bazzini's.

30:13.856 --> 30:16.922
This is the most important night
of this guy's life!

30:16.922 --> 30:18.222
Will Paul rise
to the occasion?

30:18.222 --> 30:19.856
It's raw.

30:19.856 --> 30:21.722
Or will he go back
to his old ways?

30:21.722 --> 30:22.756
I'm one person
with two hands.

30:22.756 --> 30:23.856
Giving excuse...

30:23.856 --> 30:25.689
Don't have eyes
in the back of my head.

30:25.689 --> 30:26.989
I'm doing 400 things
at once.

30:26.989 --> 30:28.056
After excuse.

30:28.056 --> 30:29.656
I can't cook
and manage the tables.

30:29.656 --> 30:30.989
We're all working
together here!

30:30.989 --> 30:32.589
Quit the arguing!

30:32.589 --> 30:34.556
The survival of the restaurant
is on the line.

30:34.556 --> 30:36.322
We're sinking
like the titanicin here!

30:36.322 --> 30:37.989
But not everybody
believes in saving it.

30:37.989 --> 30:39.789
- Where's my sous chef?
- Where the  is Al?

30:39.789 --> 30:41.156
I don't know. He's gone.

30:41.156 --> 30:41.407
Al! Al!

30:41.407 --> 30:43.089
Al! Al!

30:50.290 --> 30:52.823
Inspired by Paul's
performance during lunch

30:52.823 --> 30:54.056
and his fresh pasta,

30:54.056 --> 30:56.390
Chef Ramsay and his team
work overnight

30:56.390 --> 30:58.323
to renovate
the restaurant.

31:02.457 --> 31:04.223
- Morning!
- Morning.

31:04.223 --> 31:06.023
Welcome to the new Bazzini.

31:06.023 --> 31:07.623
Oh, my God!

31:09.557 --> 31:10.990
Wow.

31:10.990 --> 31:12.490
look at it--
new trellising,

31:12.490 --> 31:14.323
New sign,
it looks inviting.

31:14.323 --> 31:15.790
It's gorgeous.

31:15.790 --> 31:16.378
with 60 restaurants,

31:16.378 --> 31:17.690
with 60 restaurants,

31:17.690 --> 31:18.890
You have to stand out.

31:18.890 --> 31:20.657
It looks spectacular.

31:20.657 --> 31:22.790
Just looks beautiful.

31:22.790 --> 31:24.490
Ready to go inside?
Yes.

31:24.490 --> 31:26.890
Let's go!
I have ants in my pants.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.357
Ohh.
Oh, my...

31:32.357 --> 31:34.390
look at this.

31:34.390 --> 31:35.923
the tables are gorgeous.

31:35.923 --> 31:37.223
i love these tchotchkes.

31:37.223 --> 31:39.057
look at that.
that is so nice.

31:39.057 --> 31:41.723
On the walls, lemon pound cake

31:41.723 --> 31:43.590
new, slick
Italian banquettes.

31:43.590 --> 31:44.923
Isn't that lovely?

31:44.923 --> 31:46.223
It looks great.N.

31:46.223 --> 31:46.378
The color is contemporary.

31:46.378 --> 31:47.457
The color is contemporary.

31:47.457 --> 31:48.990
Look at the napkins.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.657
"Fresh Pasta Made Daily."

31:50.657 --> 31:52.257
Welcome to Bazzini's!
Freakin' awesome.

31:52.257 --> 31:55.123
The dining room is beautiful.

31:55.123 --> 31:57.257
I never thought in a million
years this could happen.

31:57.257 --> 31:59.557
And, um...

31:59.557 --> 32:00.923
We are so grateful.

32:00.923 --> 32:02.223
Thank you again.
Come here, you.

32:02.223 --> 32:05.723
Oh, good, my darling.
I'm glad you're happy.

32:05.723 --> 32:08.057
The restaurant renovation
was drastic.

32:08.057 --> 32:10.957
But the biggest change
to Bazzini's is the menu.

32:10.957 --> 32:13.990
Chef Ramsay has taken
the old risotto,

32:13.990 --> 32:14.990
the disgusting chicken,

32:14.990 --> 32:16.378
and the bland tilapia

32:16.378 --> 32:16.790
and the bland tilapia

32:16.790 --> 32:19.290
and replaced them
with a new and vibrant menu,

32:19.290 --> 32:20.790
featuring fresh pasta.

32:20.790 --> 32:24.190
Love the menu.
From 27 dishes down to 15.

32:24.190 --> 32:26.223
Why is it reduced?
because it's fast.

32:26.223 --> 32:27.890
The idea is everything's
cooked to order.

32:27.890 --> 32:28.957
It's fresh.

32:28.957 --> 32:30.023
Char-grilled calamari

32:30.023 --> 32:31.857
with fresh chili
and arugula.

32:31.857 --> 32:33.823
The main entree's bistecca,

32:33.823 --> 32:35.090
fresh caponata
with white beans.

32:35.090 --> 32:36.757
Pasta today
is gonna be tagliatelle

32:36.757 --> 32:38.623
of mussels and clams.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.623
That's the Hallmark.

32:39.623 --> 32:41.323
Paul, is that menu
manageable?

32:41.323 --> 32:42.623
Yep.

32:42.623 --> 32:44.723
Looking at the menu,
the bar is set at the ten,

32:44.723 --> 32:46.378
and we need to be able to get
as high to the ten as possible.

32:46.378 --> 32:47.223
and we need to be able to get
as high to the ten as possible.

32:47.223 --> 32:49.423
Certainly nothing less
than an 8 1/2.

32:49.423 --> 32:52.123
desserts.
Sharyn, carrot cake.

32:52.123 --> 32:53.657
Look at it--beautiful,
sumptuous, sexy,

32:53.657 --> 32:55.290
and something you want
to take home to bed.

32:56.423 --> 32:58.990
oy, yoy, yoy.

32:58.990 --> 32:59.990
What?

32:59.990 --> 33:01.157
Take home to bed?

33:01.157 --> 33:03.223
Oh, boy. Whew.

33:03.223 --> 33:04.823
You're killin' me.

33:09.490 --> 33:10.890
Hello, welcome.
You are...

33:10.890 --> 33:11.890
Panera.
Panera.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.290
With the new menu

33:13.290 --> 33:14.523
And the new decor in place...

33:14.523 --> 33:15.823
Follow me, please.

33:15.823 --> 33:16.378
Chef Ramsay has invited V.I.P.s

33:16.378 --> 33:17.790
Chef Ramsay has invited V.I.P.s

33:17.790 --> 33:19.990
and dignitaries to show
why Bazzini's is special,

33:19.990 --> 33:23.357
even amongst
the 60 restaurants in town.

33:23.357 --> 33:25.990
Let's see what
this new menu offers us.

33:25.990 --> 33:29.357
All pastas fresh, made here
on the premises today.

33:29.357 --> 33:31.557
I'm gonna have
the calamari to start with.

33:31.557 --> 33:33.590
Calamari to start you off.
excellent.

33:34.623 --> 33:35.790
First order, yes?

33:35.790 --> 33:37.390
One polenta, one calamari?
yes, Chef.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.423
You have one tortellini?
Yes, Chef.

33:38.423 --> 33:39.823
One tagliatelle?

33:39.823 --> 33:41.657
al, I would get
the calamari working, okay?

33:41.657 --> 33:43.223
I want to try and get
a little bit more color on it.

33:43.223 --> 33:44.790
Tickets are coming in.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.378
I'm not thinking about,
"Am I gonna be able to do it?"

33:46.378 --> 33:46.823
I'm not thinking about,
"Am I gonna be able to do it?"

33:46.823 --> 33:48.123
I'm not thinking about,
"Oh, my God, we're gonna crash."

33:48.123 --> 33:50.590
It's about me
and pushing myself

33:50.590 --> 33:52.323
to be the person that I am.

33:52.323 --> 33:54.823
Tonight Paul's attitude
couldn't be better...

33:54.823 --> 33:57.090
Get, like, four more
polentas working, please.

33:57.090 --> 33:59.657
And everything in the kitchen
seems to be right on track.

33:59.657 --> 34:01.823
This is table
number 21, Chef.
Okay, good.

34:01.823 --> 34:05.657
Now the first appetizers
are at the pass.

34:05.657 --> 34:07.723
Hey, guys,
it's raw here.

34:07.723 --> 34:08.790
Touch that.

34:08.790 --> 34:10.223
I can't send out
raw calamari, yeah?

34:10.223 --> 34:11.223
Paul, please.
Yes, Chef.

34:11.223 --> 34:12.657
It's  raw.

34:12.657 --> 34:13.657
Ay, God.

34:14.890 --> 34:16.378
make sure everything's cooked.

34:16.378 --> 34:18.057
make sure everything's cooked.

34:18.057 --> 34:19.957
Paul, these tables
are very important.

34:19.957 --> 34:21.390
I need a second
to think.

34:21.390 --> 34:23.290
Oh, come on.

34:24.890 --> 34:26.957
Al, you got to--
come on, I need help.

34:26.957 --> 34:28.323
I need for you
to get in the game with me.

34:28.323 --> 34:29.857
Please, I-I can't do it
all alone.

34:29.857 --> 34:31.523
Al, please tell me
I have polenta.

34:31.523 --> 34:33.257
Please tell me
i have polenta.

34:33.257 --> 34:34.557
I know what's on the line.

34:34.557 --> 34:35.790
I know we got dignitaries
in the dining room.

34:35.790 --> 34:38.123
We have to get the job done.
We have to get it done well.

34:38.123 --> 34:40.390
We have to just
get it done.

34:40.390 --> 34:41.757
Got an order in.
It's table 21.

34:41.757 --> 34:42.990
guys, I can't cook

34:42.990 --> 34:44.657
And talk
and manage the tickets.

34:44.657 --> 34:46.378
I need help.
Not working alone here.

34:46.378 --> 34:46.823
I need help.
Not working alone here.

34:46.823 --> 34:49.290
Paul was a total disaster.

34:49.290 --> 34:50.790
He got flustered, I guess.

34:50.790 --> 34:53.757
And there was a lack
of communication.

34:53.757 --> 34:56.423
The pressure of relaunch night

34:56.423 --> 34:58.757
Had clearly gotten to Paul,
his sous chef Al,

34:58.757 --> 35:00.257
and the rest
of the kitchen staff.

35:00.257 --> 35:01.557
No, we're not firing
at the moment.

35:01.557 --> 35:03.857
And 45 minutes in,

35:03.857 --> 35:06.557
Not a single entree
has left the kitchen.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.623
Talk to me, Paul, please.

35:10.623 --> 35:12.890
Okay, I--
24, tortellini,
tag special.

35:12.890 --> 35:14.457
It's only a two-top, yeah?

35:14.457 --> 35:15.823
But, chef, I want to get
these four pastas out first.

35:15.823 --> 35:16.378
Yeah, I know, but what
I'm trying to say to you

35:16.378 --> 35:17.957
Yeah, I know, but what
I'm trying to say to you

35:17.957 --> 35:18.957
is it's the same dish.

35:18.957 --> 35:20.623
Put a four-
and a two-top together,

35:20.623 --> 35:22.057
kill two birds
with one stone.

35:22.057 --> 35:23.223
Position yourself.
Absolutely.

35:23.223 --> 35:25.523
Manipulate the board
to your advantage, come on.

35:25.523 --> 35:27.123
An hour and a half later,
we're hungry.
Of course.

35:27.123 --> 35:29.190
Yeah, this is...
I'm sorry.

35:29.190 --> 35:31.023
It's an hour
and 40 minutes.
I absolutely understand.

35:31.023 --> 35:32.457
Well, I hate to say it,

35:32.457 --> 35:34.623
but 33 has been
waiting forever.

35:34.623 --> 35:35.957
I mean, they were
one of the first tables

35:35.957 --> 35:37.090
that walked in this door.

35:37.090 --> 35:38.490
Everything
is a complete mess.

35:38.490 --> 35:39.823
Nobody's getting their food.

35:39.823 --> 35:41.423
The orders are all mixed up.

35:41.423 --> 35:42.990
It's just unbelievable
out there.

35:42.990 --> 35:45.123
These V.I.P. tables, yeah,
are waiting too long.

35:45.123 --> 35:46.378
i need some help.
i need someone to move tickets.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.223
i need some help.
i need someone to move tickets.

35:47.223 --> 35:48.623
I can't
do everything myself.

35:48.623 --> 35:49.823
i need some communication.

35:49.823 --> 35:51.490
We need to  cook!

35:51.490 --> 35:54.423
We're sinking
like the titanicin here!

35:54.423 --> 35:56.790
Let's just cook!

35:56.790 --> 35:59.057
This is such a shame.

35:59.057 --> 36:01.723
Paul shut down.
he's not communicating.

36:01.723 --> 36:04.957
And more importantly,
I think he's given up.

36:06.390 --> 36:07.457
For God sakes.

36:07.457 --> 36:08.790
Come on, Paul!

36:08.790 --> 36:09.823
Paul!

36:09.823 --> 36:11.890
I'm doing 400 things
at once.

36:11.890 --> 36:13.523
I'm trying to do
damage control at this point.

36:13.523 --> 36:14.957
Damage control
is not what I want to do.

36:14.957 --> 36:16.378
At this point, I want to cook.
I want to get food out.

36:16.378 --> 36:16.623
At this point, I want to cook.
I want to get food out.

36:16.623 --> 36:18.357
I want, you know, clearly,
I need some help.

36:18.357 --> 36:21.290
41.
I need to know how long.

36:21.290 --> 36:22.857
I need someone to tell me
what 41 is.

36:22.857 --> 36:24.290
Don't have eyes
in the back of my head.

36:24.290 --> 36:25.990
okay.

36:25.990 --> 36:27.790
What's our E.T.A.
on 45, Paul?

36:27.790 --> 36:30.057
Al, talk to Al.
guys...

36:30.057 --> 36:32.690
Please start cooking!

36:32.690 --> 36:33.757
45--

36:33.757 --> 36:35.457
wait, I still don't
have an answer on 41.

36:35.457 --> 36:36.790
Oh,.
See?

36:36.790 --> 36:38.423
This table's been waiting
for an hour.

36:38.423 --> 36:39.557
Can't do it all.

36:39.557 --> 36:40.923
I-I got this.

36:40.923 --> 36:42.257
Don't know that
for sure.

36:42.257 --> 36:43.457
Well, I've been waiting
for, like--

36:43.457 --> 36:44.757
everybody here is waiting.
shh!

36:44.757 --> 36:46.378
Hey, don't shush me.
We're all working together here!

36:46.378 --> 36:46.823
Hey, don't shush me.
We're all working together here!

36:46.823 --> 36:48.790
- We don't need a shusher!
- guys!

36:48.790 --> 36:51.123
This is the most
important night

36:51.123 --> 36:52.657
of this guy's life.

36:52.657 --> 36:53.723
Quit the arguing!

36:57.257 --> 36:58.957
Everything crashed.

36:58.957 --> 37:00.723
I don't know if it was
the titanicor the hindenburg,

37:00.723 --> 37:01.923
but it's a  mess.

37:01.923 --> 37:03.823
All right, I know
you don't want to hear this.

37:03.823 --> 37:06.823
But I need a pasta special,
and I need it immediately.

37:06.823 --> 37:08.857
Bloody hell, where's Al?
Where's my sous chef?

37:08.857 --> 37:10.957
I'm the only one
in this kitchen.

37:10.957 --> 37:12.790
Al!

37:12.790 --> 37:14.290
Al!

37:14.290 --> 37:15.323
Where is Al?

37:15.323 --> 37:16.357
I don't know.

37:16.357 --> 37:16.378
Where the  is Al?

37:16.378 --> 37:17.523
Where the  is Al?

37:17.523 --> 37:18.523
We don't know.
he's gone.

37:18.523 --> 37:19.823
No sign of him.

37:19.823 --> 37:20.790
He's clearly gone.

37:20.790 --> 37:21.790
For God sakes, man.

37:21.790 --> 37:24.123
Al!

37:24.123 --> 37:25.123
Al!

37:28.157 --> 37:29.857
Where is he?

37:37.658 --> 37:39.191
It's relaunch night
at Bazzini's,

37:39.191 --> 37:41.725
And not only are customers
getting restless...

37:41.725 --> 37:43.991
An hour and a half later,
we're hungry.
Of course.

37:43.991 --> 37:45.625
But sous chef Al has gone awol.

37:45.625 --> 37:47.025
Where's Al?
Where's my sous chef?

37:47.025 --> 37:48.191
Al!

37:48.191 --> 37:49.191
Al!

37:49.191 --> 37:50.825
I think he quit.

37:50.825 --> 37:52.691
I was shocked
that Al walked out.

37:52.691 --> 37:53.791
That really sucks.

37:53.791 --> 37:55.291
There was a shock wave

37:55.291 --> 37:57.325
that went through the kitchen,
the service staff.

37:57.325 --> 37:59.791
No one could really
believe it.

37:59.791 --> 38:02.191
Come on, guys.
Please.

38:02.191 --> 38:04.352
When you're just left
high and dry like that,

38:04.352 --> 38:05.191
When you're just left
high and dry like that,

38:05.191 --> 38:06.225
it's a little difficult.

38:06.225 --> 38:08.391
Listen to me--
Al may be gone,

38:08.391 --> 38:09.525
but the customers
need feeding.

38:09.525 --> 38:11.191
Let's support one another.

38:11.191 --> 38:13.925
But as a human being
with compassion,

38:13.925 --> 38:15.791
You go in, you help,

38:15.791 --> 38:17.091
and you give it
your best shot.

38:17.091 --> 38:18.925
All right,
take a deep breath.

38:18.925 --> 38:20.225
I'm glad to help.

38:20.225 --> 38:21.691
If you cook
the garnishes,

38:21.691 --> 38:22.791
I can cook the lamb
and the strip.

38:22.791 --> 38:23.791
Yes?
Yes, Chef.

38:23.791 --> 38:24.891
Let's go, then.

38:24.891 --> 38:26.325
I can only imagine
what's happening

38:26.325 --> 38:27.325
in that kitchen
back there.

38:27.325 --> 38:28.391
Start work on three tag.

38:28.391 --> 38:30.158
Two caponatas
straight after, yes?
Yes, Chef.

38:30.158 --> 38:32.458
Good, I'll do the risotto.
Sharyn, so you with me?

38:32.458 --> 38:34.352
I'm totally with you.

38:34.352 --> 38:34.858
I'm totally with you.

38:34.858 --> 38:36.191
Sharyn, congratulations.
You're the new sous chef.

38:36.191 --> 38:38.491
I'm very embarrassed.
Our sous chef walked out.

38:38.491 --> 38:40.491
It's not even--
Paul, it's too tight.

38:40.491 --> 38:42.525
You know, it's like--
it's just like staunch, yeah?

38:44.058 --> 38:45.391
Good girl, Sharyn.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.691
Thank you, Chef.
Good girl, let's go.

38:47.691 --> 38:49.558
Talk to me.
Come on, Paul, please.

38:49.558 --> 38:51.125
I'm one minute
from dressing.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.225
I'm one minute
from dressing!

38:53.225 --> 38:54.291
Chef, I'm working!

38:54.291 --> 38:55.858
It's still gonna be
a few minutes--I apologize.

38:55.858 --> 38:57.125
Tag special,
in the window.

38:57.125 --> 38:59.325
Good girl.
Thank you, Sharyn.

38:59.325 --> 39:00.558
Service, please!

39:00.558 --> 39:02.058
To save tonight's
dinner service,

39:02.058 --> 39:03.325
Chef Ramsay has taken over
the kitchen.

39:03.325 --> 39:04.352
Come back for the risotto,
please.

39:04.352 --> 39:05.191
Come back for the risotto,
please.

39:05.191 --> 39:06.958
and along with Sharyn's help...

39:06.958 --> 39:08.458
Well done, Sharyn.

39:08.458 --> 39:10.091
Food is now
entering the dining room.

39:10.091 --> 39:12.291
Ask and you shall,
sometimes in time, receive.

39:12.291 --> 39:14.225
But now the question is,

39:14.225 --> 39:17.258
do the customers feel
it was worth the wait?

39:17.258 --> 39:19.291
The food is fantastic.
Worth the wait.

39:19.291 --> 39:21.891
The risotto
has a wonderful taste.

39:21.891 --> 39:24.191
Great risotto.

39:25.258 --> 39:26.258
The chicken
was delicious.

39:26.258 --> 39:27.258
It's really good.

39:29.791 --> 39:31.258
We had some challenges,
you know.

39:31.258 --> 39:33.458
We had some things
that weren't expected to happen.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.352
But, that said,
everyone stepped up

39:34.352 --> 39:35.391
But, that said,
everyone stepped up

39:35.391 --> 39:36.391
as best as they could.

39:36.391 --> 39:37.858
Got good feedback
from the people.

39:37.858 --> 39:40.225
So, you know,
I feel it was a success.

39:43.591 --> 39:46.291
Before I spend some time
with Paul and Leslie,

39:46.291 --> 39:48.225
I just want to say
a big thank you.

39:48.225 --> 39:50.091
Yeah, your desserts
are fantastic.

39:50.091 --> 39:52.391
Over the desserts,
your personality is, for me,

39:52.391 --> 39:53.925
fundamental to the longevity

39:53.925 --> 39:55.358
and the potential success
of this restaurant.

39:55.358 --> 39:57.558
And I just want to say,
uh, a big thank you.

39:57.558 --> 39:59.191
Well done, my darling.
Yeah.

39:59.191 --> 40:00.858
Oh, ay, yi, yi, yi.

40:00.858 --> 40:02.425
I enjoyed his company.

40:02.425 --> 40:04.191
I think he enjoyed mine.

40:04.191 --> 40:04.352
And I hope
I made him proud...

40:04.352 --> 40:05.225
And I hope
I made him proud...

40:05.225 --> 40:06.291
Thank you.

40:06.291 --> 40:08.225
'Cause I really tried
very hard.

40:11.191 --> 40:12.691
Right.
That wasn't easy.

40:12.691 --> 40:15.191
No.
no, nowhere near it.

40:15.191 --> 40:16.425
Uh, however,

40:16.425 --> 40:17.691
I know the customers
loved the food.

40:17.691 --> 40:18.958
Absolutely.
yeah.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.258
And tonight confirmed

40:20.258 --> 40:22.291
that you have an identity.

40:22.291 --> 40:25.025
Mm-hmm.
The fresh pasta
is out there.

40:25.025 --> 40:26.891
But...

40:26.891 --> 40:28.525
truthfully,

40:28.525 --> 40:31.158
as hard as this is
for me to say to you

40:31.158 --> 40:32.725
face-to-face,

40:32.725 --> 40:33.958
honestly, Paul,

40:33.958 --> 40:34.352
you haven't changed enough

40:34.352 --> 40:36.391
you haven't changed enough

40:36.391 --> 40:38.291
to convince me

40:38.291 --> 40:41.291
that this can turn around.

40:44.525 --> 40:48.125
I was totally focused
and totally committed.

40:48.125 --> 40:49.125
No. No.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.625
You weren't, Paul.

40:50.625 --> 40:52.891
Chef...
no, no.
come on, big boy.

40:52.891 --> 40:55.291
The first appetizer
had raw squid--

40:55.291 --> 40:56.958
not slightly seared,

40:56.958 --> 40:58.725
raw.

40:58.725 --> 41:00.225
20 minutes later,

41:00.225 --> 41:01.491
the place was sunk.

41:01.491 --> 41:03.225
You needed me.

41:03.225 --> 41:04.352
I regrouped,

41:04.352 --> 41:05.225
I regrouped,

41:05.225 --> 41:07.358
got the kitchen
back together.

41:07.358 --> 41:11.225
I've never worked this hard
in launching a restaurant.

41:11.225 --> 41:12.425
The truth hurts, Paul.

41:12.425 --> 41:14.391
You've got to start
telling yourself

41:14.391 --> 41:15.725
some serious home truths.

41:15.725 --> 41:17.591
The way to becoming
a better chef

41:17.591 --> 41:19.558
is to realize your weaknesses
and improve those weaknesses.

41:19.558 --> 41:22.091
I've taken
all of the advice,

41:22.091 --> 41:23.458
and I've taken
a lot of it to heart

41:23.458 --> 41:25.658
and I've seen a lot of it--
of what I do is wrong.

41:25.658 --> 41:27.291
Here's my advice.

41:27.291 --> 41:29.158
At the heart
of this restaurant

41:29.158 --> 41:30.491
has to be you--

41:30.491 --> 41:33.125
your food,
you on the plate.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.352
You have to stand up
to the plate

41:34.352 --> 41:36.225
You have to stand up
to the plate

41:36.225 --> 41:37.358
and hold the reins.

41:37.358 --> 41:39.225
I know that it starts
and stops with me,

41:39.225 --> 41:41.225
and I know that I have
to be the leader,

41:41.225 --> 41:42.391
and I know that I have
to command the troops.

41:42.391 --> 41:44.025
And I take responsibility
for that.

41:44.025 --> 41:47.158
You say all
the right things always.

41:47.158 --> 41:50.191
But now it's time
to do the right things.

41:52.158 --> 41:53.558
Right.

41:53.558 --> 41:55.325
Good night.
Thank you.

41:55.325 --> 41:57.158
Good night, darling.

41:57.158 --> 41:59.191
I think that Chef Ramsay came,
and it really...

41:59.191 --> 42:01.325
Identified the problems.

42:01.325 --> 42:03.791
And I think he certainly
helped Paul,

42:03.791 --> 42:04.352
and I totally feel
that all the tools we have

42:04.352 --> 42:06.391
and I totally feel
that all the tools we have

42:06.391 --> 42:07.458
are enough
to save the restaurant.

42:07.458 --> 42:09.291
Chef...
Yes, Chef?

42:09.291 --> 42:10.858
Good luck.
Thank you very much.

42:10.858 --> 42:11.858
Appreciate everything.

42:11.858 --> 42:13.391
Appreciate all
of your hard work

42:13.391 --> 42:15.358
and everything
you've done for me.

42:15.358 --> 42:17.758
It's over to you now.
I won't let you down.

42:17.758 --> 42:19.258
This experience
has been amazing.

42:19.258 --> 42:21.425
I've been put
on the path to success,

42:21.425 --> 42:23.058
and I'm really excited
about going forward.

42:23.058 --> 42:25.525
Please,
don't let yourself down.

42:25.525 --> 42:26.525
Thanks very much.
Good night.

42:26.525 --> 42:27.558
Good night.

42:30.292 --> 42:32.292
What a week.

42:32.292 --> 42:33.992
Ridgewood
may have 60 restaurants

42:33.992 --> 42:34.352
within four blocks,

42:34.352 --> 42:35.225
within four blocks,

42:35.225 --> 42:37.358
but I do believe
the new Bazzini's

42:37.358 --> 42:40.825
with its fresh pasta,
can be a huge local success.

42:40.825 --> 42:44.625
Unfortunately, I'm just
not sure about Paul, but...

42:44.625 --> 42:48.158
Nothing would make me happier
if he could prove me wrong.

42:52.125 --> 42:53.992
After Gordon's departure,

42:53.992 --> 42:56.259
Paul immediately
hired a strong sous chef.

42:56.259 --> 42:58.492
And with the new
fresh-pasta identity,

42:58.492 --> 43:00.592
Bazzini's experienced
a boost in business.

43:00.592 --> 43:02.059
It's very good.

43:02.059 --> 43:04.352
Sadly, Sharyn
left the restaurant

43:04.352 --> 43:05.359
Sadly, Sharyn
left the restaurant

43:05.359 --> 43:06.659
to get away from Paul

43:06.659 --> 43:09.659
and to focus
on her own dessert business.
