00:01.523 --> 00:05.220
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

00:05.222 --> 00:07.951
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

00:07.953 --> 00:10.954
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

00:10.956 --> 00:12.422
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

00:12.424 --> 00:14.791
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

00:14.793 --> 00:17.895
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

00:17.897 --> 00:20.297
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

00:20.299 --> 00:22.131
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

00:22.133 --> 00:25.801
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

00:27.138 --> 00:28.938
<i>Previously on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:28.940 --> 00:30.506
Time Masters.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.174
They took me to a place
called the Vanishing Point.

00:32.176 --> 00:35.311
I've spent lifetimes
training by them

00:35.313 --> 00:37.446
<i>Mr. Jackson's internal organs</i>

00:37.448 --> 00:38.947
<i>are aging
at an accelerated rate.</i>

00:38.949 --> 00:40.748
<i>The res of his body
will soon follow.</i>

00:40.750 --> 00:41.950
The trip through
the Time Stream

00:41.952 --> 00:43.718
should reverse you condition.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.722
If we're separated,
you'll die.

00:47.724 --> 00:51.893
This man you've brought before
us is needed back in 2166.

00:51.895 --> 00:53.494
- Take him away.
- What?

00:53.496 --> 00:56.363
<i>Search their ship
for the others.</i>

00:56.365 --> 00:58.432
- You're under arrest.
- Mick, what's going on?

00:58.434 --> 00:59.866
We need to find
somewhere to hide.

00:59.868 --> 01:02.736
<i>I need to be getting back
to 2166.</i>

01:02.738 --> 01:05.839
I've been waiting to meet
your family.

01:05.841 --> 01:08.075
And because if you don't
follow me,

01:08.077 --> 01:12.579
this is what is in store for
your world 150 years from now.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:26.761 --> 01:29.995
I could have chosen
any time and any place.

01:29.997 --> 01:31.863
Of all the people
who ever lived,

01:31.865 --> 01:33.265
I chose you eight.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.800
I certainly hope
that you won't let me,

01:35.802 --> 01:38.003
and the world, down.

01:46.513 --> 01:47.711
If your answer is yes,

01:47.713 --> 01:49.713
meet me at this address
in 36 hours.

01:53.052 --> 01:55.019
So what do you think?

01:55.021 --> 01:57.788
I think that's five minutes
of my life I'm not getting back.

01:57.790 --> 02:00.757
He just showed us
the entire world in flames.

02:00.759 --> 02:02.026
You can't turn your back
on that.

02:02.028 --> 02:04.227
Observe.

02:06.031 --> 02:07.630
Well, I think we can
all agree

02:07.632 --> 02:08.865
that the mission will go
a whole lot better

02:08.866 --> 02:10.133
without those two.

02:10.134 --> 02:11.434
I haven't signed on yet.

02:11.436 --> 02:12.869
And I'm not signing on
at all.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.570
- Jefferson...
- No.

02:14.572 --> 02:17.007
I'm not going off to die
in some apocalyptic future.

02:17.009 --> 02:21.210
I'm staying right here
in the present.

02:21.212 --> 02:24.046
Let me talk to him.

02:24.048 --> 02:27.349
Jefferson, can we at least
discuss this?

02:27.351 --> 02:28.950
Oh, that's a first.

02:28.952 --> 02:30.585
And it was always you
trying to tell me what to do.

02:30.587 --> 02:32.021
It's not happening this time.

02:32.023 --> 02:34.223
But if the fate of the world
is at stake...

02:34.225 --> 02:37.159
Then the world can find
somebody more capable than me.

02:37.161 --> 02:39.394
I have confidence in us
as Firestorm.

02:39.396 --> 02:41.529
All right, look,
just sleep on it.

02:41.531 --> 02:44.132
Come to my office tomorrow,
and if your answer's still no...

02:44.134 --> 02:46.300
It will be.

02:51.374 --> 02:55.242
Grey, we need to talk.

02:55.244 --> 02:57.344
We were just talking.

02:57.346 --> 03:00.247
How did you change your clothes
so fast?

03:00.249 --> 03:02.849
Something called time travel.

03:02.851 --> 03:04.384
I need your help.

03:04.386 --> 03:08.088
The team's in trouble.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.737
Martin, are you okay?

03:25.739 --> 03:29.240
I'm required to merge
with Jefferson...

03:29.242 --> 03:32.177
periodically in order
to maintain nuclear cohesion.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.778
Then sending him away
on the Jumpship

03:33.780 --> 03:36.181
probably wasn't
the greatest idea.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.915
Given the circumstances
we're under,

03:37.917 --> 03:39.984
I'm surprised any of us
are alive.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.787
Oh, you'll be dead soon.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.689
You're getting off easy.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.957
What gives you the free pass?

03:46.959 --> 03:50.694
- They have other plans for me.
- As Chronos.

03:50.696 --> 03:52.096
They're gonna try
and put me through

03:52.098 --> 03:54.298
the induction process again.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.067
- Brainwashing?
- Kills most men, Professor.

03:57.069 --> 03:59.103
And those that don't die,

03:59.105 --> 04:02.106
end up like mindless goats.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.372
But Snart said
you weren't mindless

04:03.374 --> 04:04.574
when you were Chronos.

04:04.576 --> 04:06.275
Not any more that usual,
anyway.

04:08.045 --> 04:10.646
The whole time,
I stayed focused on one thing.

04:10.648 --> 04:14.150
The one thing
that kept me sane...

04:14.152 --> 04:15.551
vengeance.

04:15.553 --> 04:19.288
I focused on how much
I hated all of you.

04:19.290 --> 04:23.091
Ah, gentlemen,
I missed you.

04:23.093 --> 04:25.627
Come on in.

04:25.629 --> 04:28.997
Ah, that's it.
Oh, yeah, break my arm.

04:28.999 --> 04:33.001
Hey, what are you doing?
Why are you taking her?

04:33.003 --> 04:34.669
Hey!

04:44.547 --> 04:46.013
Hey!

04:46.015 --> 04:48.715
Kendra!

04:48.717 --> 04:50.284
Kendra!

05:03.731 --> 05:05.931
Leave us.

05:09.704 --> 05:11.037
I have a query.

05:11.039 --> 05:12.871
Why haven't
we killed you yet?

05:12.873 --> 05:15.073
That's what you've been trying
to do all this time.

05:15.075 --> 05:16.808
Fortunately for you,

05:16.810 --> 05:18.544
two of your crew
are still at large.

05:18.546 --> 05:19.911
Tell me where to find them,

05:19.913 --> 05:21.647
and I'll spare the others.

05:21.649 --> 05:24.516
If it is anything like the
offer you gave me in the USSR,

05:24.518 --> 05:25.850
I'm sorely tempted.

05:25.852 --> 05:27.952
You were a fugitive
from justice.

05:27.954 --> 05:29.353
You're helping Vandal Savage
take over the world.

05:29.355 --> 05:30.721
I have a feeling
that our definition

05:30.723 --> 05:33.291
of the word "justice"
may differ somewhat.

05:33.293 --> 05:35.259
The only difference
between us

05:35.261 --> 05:38.062
is my view of the timeline
reaches further

05:38.064 --> 05:39.363
and wider than yours.

05:39.365 --> 05:41.699
Am I supposed
to be impressed?

05:43.436 --> 05:45.868
In 2175,
less than ten years

05:45.870 --> 05:47.571
from when Savage
conquers the world,

05:47.573 --> 05:50.073
the Earth is attacked
by a warlike race

05:50.075 --> 05:53.476
of extraterrestrials
from the planet Thanagar.

05:53.478 --> 05:58.548
Without Savage to unite
the world under a singular rule,

05:58.550 --> 06:00.817
this is what becomes
of the world.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.884
This is the work of Savage.

06:02.886 --> 06:04.286
No.

06:04.288 --> 06:06.522
This is what will happen
to Earth

06:06.524 --> 06:08.790
if Savage is not there
to lead it.

06:08.792 --> 06:12.094
Without him,
all human life is extinguished.

06:12.096 --> 06:15.264
Even this realm falls
to the Thanagarians.

06:15.266 --> 06:16.599
Are you impressed now?

06:16.601 --> 06:18.701
No.

06:18.703 --> 06:21.469
You are as mad
as your friend Vandal

06:21.471 --> 06:26.140
if you think that he
is the world's only hope.

06:26.142 --> 06:29.510
We've examined the timeline.
There is no other hope.

06:29.512 --> 06:32.680
I don't expect you
to take my word for it.

06:32.682 --> 06:35.316
That's why there's something
else I have to show you.

06:49.064 --> 06:52.299
How did you even know
that was down there?

06:52.301 --> 06:55.033
When Rip first recruited us,
I made it my business

06:55.035 --> 06:57.270
to case every square inch
of this tub

06:57.272 --> 06:59.272
in the event there was
something worth stealing.

06:59.274 --> 07:01.840
There wasn't.
Let's get out of here.

07:01.842 --> 07:03.576
Wait,
what about the team?

07:03.578 --> 07:05.010
There's nothing more
we can do for them.

07:05.012 --> 07:06.579
You're just gonna leave Mick?

07:06.581 --> 07:09.948
If the Time Masters are half
as twisted as Mick said,

07:09.950 --> 07:12.450
there's an excellent chance
Mick is no longer Mick.

07:12.452 --> 07:14.118
Now why aren't we flying yet?

07:14.120 --> 07:16.020
Because I'm not
going anywhere.

07:16.022 --> 07:18.356
And even if we wanted to,
we're in a hangar

07:18.358 --> 07:20.925
surrounded by an entire armada
of timeships.

07:20.927 --> 07:23.127
It's the Waverider.
We've got guns.

07:23.129 --> 07:24.496
We can blast our way out.

07:24.498 --> 07:26.398
This isn't
"Bonnie and Clyde."

07:26.400 --> 07:29.065
And I'm not going anywhere
without the rest of the team.

07:30.869 --> 07:34.004
Maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

07:34.006 --> 07:35.839
Don't do that.

07:35.841 --> 07:38.509
Don't act like you're that same
cold-hearted bastard

07:38.511 --> 07:39.876
that I first met.

07:39.878 --> 07:41.712
I remember Russia.

07:41.714 --> 07:43.880
And you were the one
who told me not to kill Stein.

07:43.882 --> 07:45.281
Yeah, because you seem
to have a problem

07:45.283 --> 07:47.082
with being a killer.

07:47.084 --> 07:51.554
I, however, don't.

07:51.556 --> 07:54.557
Prove it.

07:54.559 --> 07:55.958
Shoot me.

08:14.778 --> 08:17.412
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Ms. Lance.</i>

08:17.414 --> 08:19.046
Gideon, you're alive.

08:19.048 --> 08:21.782
<i>If be being "alive" you mean
that my operating system</i>

08:21.784 --> 08:23.283
<i>is intact, yes,</i>

08:23.285 --> 08:25.419
<i>I was able to upload
into the latency core</i>

08:25.421 --> 08:26.854
<i>to avoid being wiped out
when the Time Masters...</i>

08:26.856 --> 08:28.121
We can share
war stories later.

08:28.123 --> 08:29.323
Where the rest of the team?

08:29.325 --> 08:31.291
<i>They're in cell block 4587,</i>

08:31.293 --> 08:34.094
<i>and they, too, are alive...
for the moment.</i>

08:34.096 --> 08:36.429
What do you mean
"for the moment"?

08:44.305 --> 08:46.606
Oh, you're awake.

08:48.577 --> 08:49.909
Oh, I wouldn't bother.

08:49.911 --> 08:54.913
Those straps are forged
from Tiberian steel.

08:54.915 --> 08:56.948
This is a timeship.

08:56.950 --> 08:59.150
A little gift
from my friends.

09:03.323 --> 09:06.558
Oh, Prince Khufu
is with us as well.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.627
He's being held in stasis
down at the cargo hold.

09:09.629 --> 09:11.996
And where are you taking us?

09:11.998 --> 09:15.132
To an appointment
that I have.

09:15.134 --> 09:17.334
With destiny.

09:19.806 --> 09:23.173
You should be familiar
with this procedure, Chronos.

09:23.175 --> 09:25.175
The name's Mick.

09:25.177 --> 09:28.578
Though we've made
some refinements.

09:28.580 --> 09:30.313
Clearly, your conditioning
was not as thorough

09:30.315 --> 09:31.815
as it should have been.

09:31.817 --> 09:35.151
For a Time Master,
you sure waste a lot of it.

09:35.153 --> 09:37.754
Even with only
a partial induction,

09:37.756 --> 09:40.490
you were the greatest
of our hunters, Chronos.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.292
After we're finished,

09:42.294 --> 09:45.227
temporal criminals
and time pirates alike

09:45.229 --> 09:47.763
will quake at the sound
of your bootsteps.

09:47.765 --> 09:51.400
Mm, well, for your sake,
you better hope that plan works.

09:51.402 --> 09:55.471
'Cause if it doesn't, that
boot's gonna crush your skull.

10:13.790 --> 10:17.825
- What is this place?
- Our Holy of Holies.

10:17.827 --> 10:19.827
The Oculus viewing chamber,

10:19.829 --> 10:24.498
our most powerful window
into past, present, and future.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.835
The source of all
our information on the timeline.

10:27.837 --> 10:29.603
Why did I now know
about this?

10:29.605 --> 10:30.904
No captain does.

10:30.906 --> 10:33.039
The Oculus' existence
is known

10:33.041 --> 10:34.507
only to the High Council,

10:34.509 --> 10:36.876
including its greatest secret:

10:36.878 --> 10:40.212
the Oculus not only gives us
a window into time,

10:40.214 --> 10:44.083
but the ability to shape it
as we see fit.

10:44.085 --> 10:46.486
We've been helping Vandal Savage
consolidate his power

10:46.488 --> 10:48.721
by giving him access
to time travel.

10:48.723 --> 10:50.389
But you've been
helping him too.

10:50.391 --> 10:54.125
From the moment we realized only
Savage could save the world,

10:54.127 --> 10:57.295
we've been using the Oculus
to manipulate you.

10:57.297 --> 10:59.764
- That's impossible.
- Think about it.

10:59.766 --> 11:02.100
Thanks to your efforts,
Vandal Savage was not in prison

11:02.102 --> 11:05.103
for the sale of a nuclear weapon
in 1975.

11:05.105 --> 11:07.305
You prevented the Soviet Union

11:07.307 --> 11:10.440
from winning
the Cold War in 1986.

11:10.442 --> 11:15.412
Carter Hall's death provided
Savage's closest lieutenants

11:15.414 --> 11:17.882
preternaturally long lives.

11:17.884 --> 11:19.783
You and your team
have been moving

11:19.785 --> 11:21.018
through the course of time.

11:21.020 --> 11:23.521
We've merely redirected it,
and you,

11:23.523 --> 11:26.789
to the outcomes
history requires.

11:28.727 --> 11:31.828
Look,
see for yourself.

11:49.780 --> 11:51.780
You're looking into the past.

11:51.782 --> 11:55.083
You see that everything
I've told you is true.

11:55.085 --> 11:56.585
This isn't only the past.

11:56.587 --> 11:58.086
You will also see the future.

11:58.088 --> 12:00.588
Not possible future.

12:00.590 --> 12:02.389
Not a prediction.

12:02.391 --> 12:05.359
You are looking at events
as they will happen.

12:05.361 --> 12:07.995
What about choice?
What about free will?

12:07.997 --> 12:10.497
Illusions.
The only place in the universe

12:10.499 --> 12:13.634
free will exists is here
at the Vanishing Point.

12:21.643 --> 12:23.610
No!

12:23.612 --> 12:28.181
No matter what you do,
it will happen.

12:28.183 --> 12:30.717
And there is nothing
you can do to stop it.

12:30.719 --> 12:31.885
No, I acted without
your consent.

12:31.887 --> 12:33.486
In... in defiance of your orders.

12:33.488 --> 12:38.123
Everything I've done
has been to save my family.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.659
No one controls me!

12:40.661 --> 12:44.663
We counted on that,
your anger, on you going rogue.

12:44.665 --> 12:47.265
We needed something
to spur you on,

12:47.267 --> 12:49.568
to give you purpose.

12:49.570 --> 12:52.036
That's why we ordered...

12:52.038 --> 12:55.306
Savage to kill your family.

13:10.981 --> 13:12.614
Rip?

13:12.616 --> 13:14.882
Oh, my God,
they've tortured him.

13:22.992 --> 13:26.893
What did they do to you?

13:26.895 --> 13:29.362
They showed me the truth.

13:29.364 --> 13:32.766
Druce showed me something
called the Oculus.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.935
They've been controlling
us all.

13:34.937 --> 13:38.170
Nothing we've done so far
has been of our own accord.

13:38.172 --> 13:40.973
We've been following a script
laid out by the Time Masters.

13:40.975 --> 13:43.375
No, that's...
that's not possible.

13:43.377 --> 13:45.410
I-I refuse to believe that.

13:45.412 --> 13:48.948
Well, you should, Raymond...

13:48.950 --> 13:51.083
because they showed me
your death.

13:54.187 --> 13:56.387
I'm sorry.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.028
You said the team
was in trouble.

14:03.030 --> 14:04.796
What sort of trouble,
exactly?

14:04.798 --> 14:06.898
I'm not sure exactly,
but I'm getting something

14:06.900 --> 14:08.399
from our psychic connection.

14:08.401 --> 14:12.036
Which means I'm in trouble.
What happens?

14:12.038 --> 14:13.503
Come on, Grey,
you know I can't tell you that.

14:13.505 --> 14:15.572
- Says who?
- Says you...

14:15.574 --> 14:17.374
- in the future.
- Oh.

14:17.376 --> 14:19.242
And even if I didn't have
to worry about the dangers

14:19.244 --> 14:20.410
of giving you future knowledge,

14:20.412 --> 14:23.313
we got bigger things
to worry about.

14:24.684 --> 14:26.150
Hey, you're drawing
too much power

14:26.152 --> 14:27.583
from the sequestrian manifold.

14:27.585 --> 14:29.152
That's nonsense,
Jefferson.

14:29.154 --> 14:31.854
Need I remind you who invented
the sequestrian manifold?

14:31.856 --> 14:33.422
Oh, dear God.

14:33.424 --> 14:36.726
- Yeah.
- Well, you were right.

14:36.728 --> 14:38.561
Oh, don't sound
so surprised.

14:38.563 --> 14:39.929
Well, it's not often
that an auto mechanic

14:39.931 --> 14:41.931
knows more than
a nuclear physicist.

14:41.933 --> 14:45.767
You know, I forgot
how arrogant you were.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.435
"Were"?

14:47.437 --> 14:52.140
Why are you referring to me
in the past tense?

14:52.142 --> 14:54.710
Do you witness my death?

14:54.712 --> 14:58.814
Relax,
you don't die.

14:58.816 --> 15:01.415
Horribly maimed.

15:01.417 --> 15:04.384
Why won't you tell me
what happens?

15:04.386 --> 15:06.220
Instead of pestering me
about the future

15:06.222 --> 15:08.589
and being
an insufferable know-it-all,

15:08.591 --> 15:11.192
why don't you help me
reroute the temporal flow

15:11.194 --> 15:12.993
off the secondary buffer

15:12.995 --> 15:14.795
instead of just
worrying about yourself?

15:14.797 --> 15:17.064
- Hmm?
- All right.

15:23.371 --> 15:27.273
I apologize for how painful
the induction process was.

15:27.275 --> 15:31.077
Many of your memories
were rooted deep.

15:31.079 --> 15:33.880
It took effort
to pull them out.

15:33.882 --> 15:35.480
Tell me...

15:35.482 --> 15:37.549
what is your name?

15:39.086 --> 15:42.454
Your name!

15:44.225 --> 15:46.558
Your name?

15:52.766 --> 15:56.000
- Your...
- Chronos.

15:56.002 --> 15:58.636
Release him.

16:06.646 --> 16:09.345
There is much hunting
to be done.

16:09.347 --> 16:12.582
Let us begin with Sara Lance
and Leonard Snart.

16:30.067 --> 16:33.169
- This is a bad plan.
- It's Gideon's.

16:33.171 --> 16:35.805
You're not helping
your argument.

16:35.807 --> 16:37.439
We need to finish putting
these on the ships,

16:37.441 --> 16:39.508
and get back
to the Waverider.

16:46.382 --> 16:48.883
I can't just stand around here
and wait to die.

16:48.885 --> 16:51.419
Well, if it's any consolation,
you're not alone.

16:51.421 --> 16:53.288
Oh, you're giving up too?

16:53.290 --> 16:56.757
Well, let's just review our
situation, shall we, Raymond?

16:56.759 --> 16:59.427
They're turning Mr. Rory
back into Chronos,

16:59.429 --> 17:02.329
I... I'm about to have
a nuclear meltdown...

17:02.331 --> 17:03.463
and our captain thinks
our future

17:03.465 --> 17:05.464
is already written for us.

17:05.467 --> 17:06.967
You know what I think?

17:06.969 --> 17:09.036
I think you're both
a couple of quitters.

17:09.038 --> 17:11.003
There's no escape
from either these cells

17:11.006 --> 17:14.174
- or from the future.
- Face the facts, Raymond.

17:14.175 --> 17:16.242
We're completely
out of allies.

17:16.244 --> 17:19.311
You're forgetting
Sarah and Snart.

17:19.314 --> 17:21.314
As long as
they're on the loose,

17:21.316 --> 17:23.281
we still have a chance.

17:23.284 --> 17:25.651
<i>Just another moment.
I'm almost through.</i>

17:25.653 --> 17:27.220
Even if this works,

17:27.222 --> 17:29.021
we're never gonna be able
to fly out off here.

17:29.023 --> 17:30.890
Well, that's the beauty
of having a timeship.

17:30.892 --> 17:32.791
We don't have to fly
anywhere.

17:35.762 --> 17:38.563
Can you stop doing that?

17:38.565 --> 17:40.732
Why did you start wearing
that thing, anyways?

17:40.734 --> 17:43.735
It's from the first job
I ever pulled off with Mick.

17:43.737 --> 17:45.370
A Freeport warehouse.

17:45.372 --> 17:48.273
Oh, you do have
a sentimental side.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.742
It's not a keepsake.
It's a reminder.

17:50.744 --> 17:51.976
Of what?

17:51.978 --> 17:54.011
That even the best laid plans

17:54.013 --> 17:55.980
can go sideways.

17:55.982 --> 17:58.815
Spent a lot of time
prepping for that heist.

17:58.817 --> 18:00.650
Casing the target.

18:00.652 --> 18:04.288
Memorizing shift changes
and delivery schedules,

18:04.290 --> 18:05.756
and then surprise!

18:05.758 --> 18:08.691
Turns out they'd upgraded
their security system.

18:08.693 --> 18:10.360
We had to bolt.

18:10.362 --> 18:13.796
Three weeks of planning
and all I have to show for it...

18:13.798 --> 18:18.001
Was a lousy pinky ring.
So sad.

18:18.003 --> 18:21.037
Considering I'm about
to trade my life for nothing,

18:21.039 --> 18:23.339
I think I came out ahead.

18:23.341 --> 18:26.441
<i>The Time Drive
is back online.</i>

18:26.443 --> 18:28.643
Strap in.

18:37.254 --> 18:40.555
Sir, the Waverider
just time-jumped.

18:40.557 --> 18:42.823
Order all available
timeships to pursue.

18:42.825 --> 18:44.025
Sir, the captains
aren't prepared for...

18:44.027 --> 18:45.592
All of them!

19:07.715 --> 19:09.916
- Godfrey, what's happening?
- <i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

19:09.918 --> 19:12.419
<i>Critical systems are being
overridden by an external...</i>

19:12.421 --> 19:14.287

19:14.289 --> 19:17.889

19:38.178 --> 19:41.212
Your friends
have time-jumped away.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.580
We've lost them.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.949
And I've lost any reason
to keep you alive.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.817
Hold on, let's just talk
about this a moment.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.486
Time Master Druce.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.520
Kill them all.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.223
- Starting with him.
- Yes, sir.

19:53.225 --> 19:56.526
But we've calculated
when the Waverider is headed.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.760
Past or future?

19:57.762 --> 19:59.863
The present.

20:12.343 --> 20:14.510
Somebody order up
a rescue?

20:14.512 --> 20:17.213
Mr. Snart,
your timing is impeccable.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.447
Or not.

20:24.087 --> 20:27.288
Put the gun down, Mick.

20:29.426 --> 20:31.893
Chronos, fire.

20:38.968 --> 20:40.968
Sure thing.

20:46.275 --> 20:50.977
If I recall,
I made you a certain promise.

20:52.948 --> 20:56.883
No, I beg of you.

20:56.885 --> 21:00.119
No!

21:07.939 --> 21:09.010
Where's everyone else?

21:09.012 --> 21:10.418
Uh, Mr. Snart is helping
the Professor

21:10.420 --> 21:11.847
get situated in the MedBay.

21:11.849 --> 21:14.116
He's not doing so how
without his nuclear super-half.

21:14.118 --> 21:16.552
Get me out of this
stupid robot suit.

21:16.554 --> 21:18.955
First get us the hell
out of here... Gideon?

21:18.957 --> 21:21.289
<i>I'm here, Captain,
and if I could take a moment</i>

21:21.291 --> 21:23.524
<i>to add how wonderful it feels
to be back together.</i>

21:23.526 --> 21:25.060
I have missed you too.

21:25.062 --> 21:26.695
<i>Now that we've had
our reunion,</i>

21:26.697 --> 21:29.197
<i>I should mention
we have a slight problem.</i>

21:31.534 --> 21:33.468
Uh, the Time Masters
are locking onto us

21:33.470 --> 21:34.535
with a tractor beam.

21:34.537 --> 21:36.037
Punch it, Gideon.

21:36.039 --> 21:37.305
Sorry, your job.

21:37.307 --> 21:39.139
Ms. Lance,
stay right where you are.

21:39.141 --> 21:40.608
You've proven yourself quite
adept at piloting this ship.

21:40.610 --> 21:42.142
About the tractor beam...

21:42.144 --> 21:43.644
Dr. Palmer is going to help me
remotely disable it.

21:43.646 --> 21:45.145
<i>I've already established
an uplink</i>

21:45.147 --> 21:46.847
<i>to the omnimatrix mainframe,
Captain.</i>

21:46.849 --> 21:48.348
The Time Masters are evil,
but they're not dumb.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.650
There's no way
they're gonna let Gideon

21:49.652 --> 21:51.451
override the tractor beam
remotely.

21:57.592 --> 21:58.791
Whatever you're gonna do,
you better do it now.

21:58.793 --> 22:00.493
- They've locked on.
- Wait.

22:00.495 --> 22:02.095
What if we convince the system
that the override command

22:02.097 --> 22:05.131
- is coming from somewhere else?
- Or someone else.

22:05.133 --> 22:06.899
Someone they trust.

22:06.901 --> 22:09.736
Just need to borrow...
Chronos' operating system.

22:09.738 --> 22:12.337
<i>I'm "hotswapping" Mr. Rory's
hard drive as we speak.</i>

22:13.707 --> 22:16.141
Whatever you're doing,
do it faster.

22:16.143 --> 22:18.510
And... done.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.249
Now, Sara!

22:35.028 --> 22:37.361
Well, I suppose it's time
to say good-bye.

22:37.363 --> 22:39.496
At least for now.

22:39.498 --> 22:41.732
Oh, one more thing,
don't forget to initiate the...

22:41.734 --> 22:44.769
The quantum attenuator once I
lock on to the Vanishing Point.

22:44.771 --> 22:47.103
Right.

22:47.105 --> 22:49.572
I suppose it's also time
to apologize

22:49.574 --> 22:52.475
for being an
"insufferable know-it-all""

22:53.679 --> 22:55.712
You know,
it used to drive me crazy,

22:55.714 --> 22:56.880
but I understand it's just
your way

22:56.882 --> 22:59.015
of trying to look out for me.

22:59.017 --> 23:01.551
Oh, by the way,
I'm going to be real pissed

23:01.553 --> 23:03.385
about this whole
roofie thing,

23:03.387 --> 23:05.988
- but I do get over it.
- Roofie thing?

23:05.990 --> 23:10.125
- I-I would never dream...
- Yeah, you do...

23:10.127 --> 23:12.895
But it's okay.

23:12.897 --> 23:17.733
It's actually
the best decision I never made.

23:17.735 --> 23:20.434
The future...

23:20.436 --> 23:22.203
you want to know
what happens?

23:22.205 --> 23:23.571
No, no,
it's... it's all right.

23:23.573 --> 23:26.107
I-I know enough.

23:27.543 --> 23:29.443
The young man in front of me
is proof

23:29.445 --> 23:32.580
that something must have
gone right on this adventure.

23:34.483 --> 23:37.417
- So long, Martin.
- So long, Jefferson.

23:43.058 --> 23:44.725
Professor's in the MedBay.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.160
Promises not to blow up
while he's on board,

23:47.162 --> 23:48.895
which I thought was considerate.

23:48.897 --> 23:50.463
Yeah, the Professor's
condition is the least

23:50.465 --> 23:52.132
of our worries, I'm afraid.

23:52.134 --> 23:54.266
Yeah, much to my chagrin,

23:54.268 --> 23:55.968
it turns out everything
we've done,

23:55.970 --> 23:57.369
maybe even our whole lives,

23:57.371 --> 23:59.805
has been determined
by the Time Masters.

23:59.807 --> 24:01.373
- What?
- The Time Masters have

24:01.375 --> 24:04.009
this thing called the Oculus,
which allows them

24:04.011 --> 24:06.278
not only to gaze
into the future,

24:06.280 --> 24:08.714
but to engineer it.

24:08.716 --> 24:11.082
A future where I'm dead,
apparently.

24:11.084 --> 24:12.751
And why would
they want you dead?

24:12.753 --> 24:15.186
Have you ever listened
to what comes out of his mouth?

24:15.188 --> 24:16.988
Now, in my opinion,
Dr. Palmer's death

24:16.990 --> 24:18.289
is not part of their plan.

24:18.291 --> 24:21.559
No, that's not reassuring.
Ow!

24:21.561 --> 24:24.195
You saying the Time Masters
wanted me to do that?

24:24.197 --> 24:26.330
What I'm saying is that
they've been engineering

24:26.332 --> 24:29.099
our lives to move
in very specific directions.

24:29.101 --> 24:32.169
And we are playing out
that script even now.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.138
So we can go to 2016,

24:34.140 --> 24:35.572
but that might be
what the Time Masters want.

24:35.574 --> 24:37.741
Or we can go get
Kendra and Carter...

24:37.743 --> 24:39.743
Which could also be
what they want.

24:39.745 --> 24:43.046
Then we need to do
what they don't want.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.248
If the Oculus is what
they're using to control us,

24:45.250 --> 24:47.250
then we need to destroy it.

24:47.252 --> 24:49.252
But how do we do that if
the Time Bastards

24:49.254 --> 24:51.020
are pulling our strings?

24:51.022 --> 24:52.889
Well, Druce told me
that the Oculus' ability

24:52.891 --> 24:55.557
to control our actions doesn't
work in the Vanishing Point,

24:55.559 --> 24:57.260
most likely because
the Vanishing Point itself

24:57.262 --> 24:58.460
exists outside of time.

24:58.462 --> 25:00.663
Explains why we were able
to escape.

25:00.665 --> 25:05.300
And why we might actually have
a shot at destroying this thing.

25:05.302 --> 25:08.069
- I'm with Ray.
- Ow.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.838
If I'm gonna be
someone's puppet,

25:09.840 --> 25:12.373
I'm gonna be the one who cuts
his own bloody strings.

25:12.375 --> 25:14.242
And I like blowing stuff up.

25:14.244 --> 25:16.845
We set out on this mission to
stop Savage and save the world.

25:16.847 --> 25:20.047
To become legends
and change our fates.

25:20.049 --> 25:21.381
That mission hasn't changed.

25:21.383 --> 25:25.419
This is madness.

25:25.421 --> 25:27.587
I like it.

25:29.692 --> 25:35.095
Gideon, plot a course
to the Oculus Wellspring.

25:35.097 --> 25:36.896
Team...

25:36.898 --> 25:40.266
I think it's about time
we seized our destinies back.

25:47.263 --> 25:49.336
Mmm.

25:50.739 --> 25:54.340
If I'm gonna die,
no sense watching my diet.

25:54.342 --> 25:55.708
The Time Masters
have been known

25:55.710 --> 25:57.743
to make mistakes,
you know?

25:57.745 --> 26:01.714
But what if those mistakes
were all part of their plan?

26:01.716 --> 26:02.948
Actually, I gotta stop
thinking about it.

26:02.950 --> 26:04.883
The temporal implications
are infinite.

26:04.885 --> 26:07.787
That's why I don't think.

26:07.789 --> 26:10.588
- Not bad, right?
- Good.

26:10.590 --> 26:13.057
- So how'd you do it?
- Do what?

26:13.059 --> 26:15.293
How did you <i>not</i>
get turned into Chronos?

26:15.295 --> 26:18.229
You said the only way you held
onto yourself the first time

26:18.231 --> 26:20.498
was by focusing on
your hate.

26:20.500 --> 26:23.301
What did I focus on
this time?

26:25.138 --> 26:26.903
The team.

26:26.905 --> 26:30.240
And how much
you cared for us?

26:30.242 --> 26:32.810
I thought about how royally
screwed you'd be without me.

26:32.812 --> 26:34.445
My point being,

26:34.447 --> 26:38.114
if I can survive
not being turned into Chronos,

26:38.116 --> 26:41.352
you can survive anything
they throw at you.

26:41.354 --> 26:43.186
Thanks.
I'll keep it in mind.

26:43.188 --> 26:45.321
Well, you better

26:45.323 --> 26:49.124
because if you tell the team
I actually care,

26:49.126 --> 26:51.327
I'll shave your head.

26:54.366 --> 26:56.566
Man, this is good.

27:07.244 --> 27:10.111
Not in the mood.

27:10.113 --> 27:13.982
I was gonna apologize
for pulling a gun on you,

27:13.984 --> 27:16.885
but apparently
I was just following a script.

27:16.887 --> 27:20.220
Doesn't make you
any less of a jerk.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.722
Guilty.

27:21.724 --> 27:24.625
So what do we think
of Rip's plan?

27:24.627 --> 27:26.894
Does it matter?

27:26.896 --> 27:28.829
Apparently everything
we're going to do

27:28.831 --> 27:31.799
has already been predetermined
by Rip's former bosses.

27:31.801 --> 27:35.234
It's funny, I've always
prided myself on being the guy

27:35.236 --> 27:37.069
who doesn't play
by the rules.

27:37.071 --> 27:41.741
Come to find out,
I'm the one being played.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.309
I don't know.

27:43.311 --> 27:46.012
I still feel responsible
for everything I've done.

27:46.014 --> 27:48.448
And it still keeps me up
at night.

27:48.450 --> 27:52.317
It's the things I didn't do
that keep me up at night.

27:52.319 --> 27:54.853
- What's that?
- Oh, I don't know.

27:54.855 --> 27:58.524
Maybe it's being on this ship
traveling through time

27:58.526 --> 28:02.093
I started to wonder what
the future might hold for me...

28:02.095 --> 28:04.396
and you...

28:04.398 --> 28:08.199
and me and you.

28:08.201 --> 28:11.268
You want to steal a kiss
from me, Leonard?

28:11.270 --> 28:13.905
You better be one hell
of a thief.

28:21.314 --> 28:23.581
How you feeling, Martin?

28:23.583 --> 28:25.782
Well, I'm dying.

28:25.784 --> 28:29.553
I'm also sure that you're dying
and so are all the others.

28:29.555 --> 28:33.289
I'm just a little
ahead of you.

28:33.291 --> 28:36.359
Normally I'd be quite concerned,
but the truth is

28:36.361 --> 28:39.463
discovering one's life
has already been predetermined

28:39.465 --> 28:42.998
is ironically liberating.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.868
I... I've already run through
everything we know

28:45.870 --> 28:49.839
about the Oculus,
and with the help of a few

28:49.841 --> 28:52.074
"back of the envelope"
physics calculations,

28:52.076 --> 28:54.443
I'm determined
that we have a chance.

28:54.445 --> 28:57.613
Infinitesimal as that may be.

28:57.615 --> 29:00.314
<i>Captain, we've arrived
at the Oculus Wellspring</i>

29:00.316 --> 29:02.584
<i>on the far side
of the Vanishing Point.</i>

29:11.427 --> 29:13.695
Based on Captain Hunter's
description,

29:13.697 --> 29:16.763
the Oculus is a massive
temporal computer,

29:16.765 --> 29:19.800
most likely powered
by a scaled-down supernova

29:19.802 --> 29:22.068
contained at the bottom
of the Wellspring.

29:22.070 --> 29:24.037
Why aren't any of you
more excited by this?

29:24.039 --> 29:25.739
We're excited
to blow it up.

29:25.741 --> 29:28.709
Dr. Palmer will deactivate
the core contained supernova,

29:28.711 --> 29:32.145
which should create
an anomalistic event.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.146
A very big explosion.

29:34.148 --> 29:35.280
Sounds like a plan.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.177
Hello again, Rip.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.478
Right on schedule.

30:13.218 --> 30:17.254
Uh, I think we've walked
into a trap.

30:17.256 --> 30:20.758
No, it's destiny.

30:27.066 --> 30:29.435
I must say you've all
played your parts well.

30:29.437 --> 30:30.992
As with everything else
you've done,

30:30.994 --> 30:33.259
I'm afraid it was all
for nothing.

30:33.261 --> 30:35.361
All your posturing.

30:35.363 --> 30:38.063
All your claims about doing
what's best for the timeline,

30:38.065 --> 30:39.831
about protecting history,

30:39.833 --> 30:42.368
and it all comes down
to cold blooded murder.

30:42.370 --> 30:45.371
The difference between
murder and execution

30:45.373 --> 30:47.939
is only a matter of authority.

30:47.941 --> 30:50.708
I have it.
You don't.

30:50.710 --> 30:51.776
Kill them.

31:22.308 --> 31:24.139
<i>Returning the Jumpship
to the Waverider.</i>

31:24.141 --> 31:26.542
- <i>Good luck, Mr. Jackson.</i>
- Hope I'm not too late.

31:26.544 --> 31:29.612
No, Jefferson,
you're right on time.

31:33.318 --> 31:34.517
- How did you...
- What?

31:34.519 --> 31:35.918
You thought you were
the only one

31:35.920 --> 31:37.553
who knew a thing or two
about time travel?

31:37.555 --> 31:39.755
Good work.
We need to get to the Oculus

31:39.757 --> 31:42.724
before reinforcements arrive.

32:13.055 --> 32:14.254
Take about two minutes
to figure out

32:14.256 --> 32:16.088
how to self-destruct
this thing.

32:16.090 --> 32:18.324
We'll buy you some time.
You lot guard the entrance.

32:18.326 --> 32:20.192
Mr. Rory, you're with me.

32:32.172 --> 32:35.907
Now if you'd excuse me,
I won't be long.

32:35.909 --> 32:40.379
Savage...
Hath-Set!

32:40.381 --> 32:43.448
Please.

32:43.450 --> 32:44.883
Don't do this.

32:44.885 --> 32:46.651
Don't kill Rip's family.

32:46.653 --> 32:51.422
In a cosmic sense,
it's already done.

32:51.424 --> 32:54.658
No!
Savage!

33:12.511 --> 33:14.277
- Hurry up, haircut.
- How much longer?

33:14.279 --> 33:16.713
Well, just about to reverse
the polarity matrix.

33:16.715 --> 33:18.515
Once I do that,
I say we have about two minutes

33:18.517 --> 33:19.816
before this whole place
goes boom.

33:19.818 --> 33:21.017
How big of a boom?

33:21.019 --> 33:22.018
On a scale from one to ten...

33:22.020 --> 33:23.685
a googolplex.

33:31.361 --> 33:32.761
- What are you doing?
- I can't work

33:32.763 --> 33:34.696
- with all this gear on.
- You can't.

33:34.698 --> 33:36.197
- A programmer needs his hands.
- Ray...

33:36.199 --> 33:38.333
- I got this, don't worry.
- No, you don't.

33:38.335 --> 33:42.069
This is what I saw.
This is what Druce showed me.

33:42.071 --> 33:46.273
This is how you die.

33:46.275 --> 33:47.809
It's okay.

33:47.811 --> 33:50.010
All my life I've wanted to
make a difference.

33:50.012 --> 33:51.178
Creating a future for you guys

33:51.180 --> 33:53.247
without the Time Masters
influence,

33:53.249 --> 33:54.782
that counts.

33:58.821 --> 34:00.921
That said,
I'm in no rush to die,

34:00.923 --> 34:02.589
so keep 'em off me, okay?

34:02.591 --> 34:03.857
We got you.

34:03.859 --> 34:06.760
Keep firing!

34:21.708 --> 34:24.242
Ahh!

34:28.983 --> 34:31.014
I'm not doing this
'cause I like you.

34:31.016 --> 34:33.250
Yes, I know.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.422
All right.
Almost done.

34:38.424 --> 34:42.360
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

34:42.362 --> 34:45.597
There seems to be a failsafe
to prevent tampering,

34:45.599 --> 34:48.231
which probably includes
trying to blow this thing up.

34:48.233 --> 34:49.699
English, haircut.

34:49.702 --> 34:51.400
I have to maintain contact
with the failsafe

34:51.402 --> 34:54.605
it order to destroy
the Oculus.

34:54.607 --> 34:56.438
Not that much English.

35:00.679 --> 35:02.312
Ahh!

35:05.282 --> 35:06.448
Get back to the ship.

35:06.450 --> 35:09.685
We are not leaving
without you.

35:12.724 --> 35:15.691
You've already seen the
future: I'm dead already.

35:15.693 --> 35:17.760
You're right.

35:21.765 --> 35:24.098
- Mick...
- I got this.

35:24.100 --> 35:26.134
I want revenge
on those bastards.

35:26.136 --> 35:27.468
Now get outta here.

35:42.151 --> 35:45.452
Your mother was brave...

35:45.454 --> 35:47.421
just as your father
was foolish.

35:47.423 --> 35:49.523
Which are you?

35:52.595 --> 35:54.762
We're leaving.

35:57.198 --> 35:58.698
Where's Raymond and Mick?

35:58.700 --> 36:01.100
Ray is in my pocket
and Mick has elected to stay.

36:01.102 --> 36:02.735
- Why?
- Someone needs to be present

36:02.737 --> 36:05.972
to destroy the Oculus.
Mick has elected himself.

36:05.974 --> 36:08.074
No, no, no, no, no, you can't.
There isn't ti...

36:08.076 --> 36:10.043
We gotta go!

36:19.653 --> 36:22.253
- Mick.
- Get outta here.

36:24.124 --> 36:25.857
Not without you, Mick.

36:25.859 --> 36:28.493
Pretty boy said I gotta hold
this stick for the ship to blow.

36:28.495 --> 36:32.229
So I'm holding this stick.
Now leave!

36:32.231 --> 36:35.800
My old friend,
please forgive me.

36:35.802 --> 36:38.803
For what?

36:41.540 --> 36:43.841
- Get him outta here.
- No.

36:43.843 --> 36:46.310
Just do it.

37:03.561 --> 37:05.861
You take after your mother,
huh?

37:11.135 --> 37:13.502
Or not.

37:13.504 --> 37:17.873
No, shut it down.

37:17.875 --> 37:19.975
Shut it down!

37:19.977 --> 37:22.910
There are no strings on me.

38:00.522 --> 38:03.823
He traded his life
for ours.

38:03.825 --> 38:05.993
He was a hero.

38:05.995 --> 38:08.660
Which I'm pretty sure is
the last thing

38:08.662 --> 38:12.331
he wanted to be
remembered as.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.533
But that's what he was.

38:24.711 --> 38:28.313
- Gideon?
- <i>Yes, Captain?</i>

38:28.315 --> 38:31.816
Would you please review
the timeline for me?

38:31.818 --> 38:33.584
<i>There is no timeline data</i>

38:33.586 --> 38:36.754
<i>due to the destruction
of the Oculus.</i>

38:36.756 --> 38:39.991
We're sailing
without a map.

38:42.594 --> 38:47.197
Uh, would you please...

38:47.199 --> 38:50.901
review news accounts
from 2166 then.

38:54.640 --> 38:57.408
You know what I need
to find out.

38:57.410 --> 39:00.143
<i>I'm sorry, Captain.</i>

39:00.145 --> 39:03.279
<i>News accounts from 2166
confirm that Vandal Savage</i>

39:03.281 --> 39:07.417
<i>has already succeeded in
murdering Miranda and Jonas.</i>

39:21.898 --> 39:24.099
Hey.

39:26.203 --> 39:29.404
Get out.
I want to be alone.

39:32.641 --> 39:37.311
Gideon has confirmed that
the Oculus has been destroyed.

39:37.313 --> 39:41.248
From here on out,
it's <i>tabula rasa.</i>

39:41.250 --> 39:44.051
Pretend for a minute
that I don't speak Greek.

39:44.053 --> 39:46.087
Latin.

39:46.089 --> 39:47.821
Sorry.

39:47.823 --> 39:50.123
From this point forward,

39:50.125 --> 39:53.126
our actions are our own.

39:53.128 --> 39:54.995
We have free will.

39:54.997 --> 39:57.030
That supposed to make me
feel better?

39:57.032 --> 39:58.564
Yes.

39:58.566 --> 40:03.269
It means that Leonard
didn't die for nothing.

40:03.271 --> 40:05.938
He planted that on me
before it happened.

40:05.940 --> 40:09.174
I'm sorry, Mick.

40:09.176 --> 40:11.276
I killed Declan,
Druce is dead.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.479
The Time Masters have nothing
now that their ship

40:13.481 --> 40:15.114
was completely destroyed.

40:15.116 --> 40:21.586
Yet I still feel a need
to kill someone for Snart.

40:21.588 --> 40:27.025
Savage still has
Carter and Kendra.

40:27.027 --> 40:29.060
He'll do nicely.

40:35.902 --> 40:39.470
Oh, don't weep for the dead,
Chay-Ara.

40:39.472 --> 40:40.837
They're mortal.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.206
They're beneath us.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.075
I want to speak
with Time Master Druce.

40:45.077 --> 40:48.512
- <i>Mr. Savage.</i>
- I wish to speak with Druce.

40:48.514 --> 40:52.115
<i>Time Master Druce is dead.</i>

40:52.117 --> 40:53.716
Hunter.

40:53.718 --> 40:56.953
<i>We've lost the ability
to manipulate time.</i>

40:56.955 --> 40:59.321
And how is that
of concern to me?

40:59.323 --> 41:01.557
<i>You are beyond our aid,
Mr. Savage.</i>

41:01.559 --> 41:03.759
<i>We cannot help you
any longer.</i>

41:03.761 --> 41:05.528
And what of the threat
of the Thanagarians?

41:05.530 --> 41:08.697
<i>Without the Oculus,
time is unmoored.</i>

41:08.699 --> 41:12.334
<i>Events will no longer unfold
as we've foreseen.</i>

41:12.336 --> 41:14.735
<i>Or as we've engineered.</i>

41:14.737 --> 41:17.372
Terminate transmission.

41:20.510 --> 41:24.812
It looks like your friends
have cut you loose.

41:24.814 --> 41:26.914
How long do you think
you can hold onto power

41:26.916 --> 41:29.684
with out the Time Masters
backing you?

41:29.686 --> 41:31.518
Not long, I'm afraid,

41:31.520 --> 41:34.288
but they have provided me
with a timeship.

41:34.290 --> 41:38.525
I no longer need to rule
the world, Chay-Ara.

41:38.527 --> 41:43.163
I now have the ability
to change it.
