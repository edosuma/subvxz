A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

01:02.437 --> 01:05.774
Of all the animals on Earth,
the most loyal is the dog.

01:06.816 --> 01:10.195
For this reason dogs have been used
on battlefields throughout history.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.672
K9 TACTICAL DIVISION

01:11.696 --> 01:14.383
For decades, our military
has attempted to create

01:14.407 --> 01:16.743
a robotic replacement
for the canine soldier,

01:17.243 --> 01:20.288
but the technology has
always ended in failure.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.061
Today, at CRAINE Systems,

01:25.085 --> 01:28.338
the company you trusted with the highly
successful hornet drone program,

01:28.922 --> 01:31.466
we seek to bring you the
war dog of the future.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.070
A-X-L...

01:34.094 --> 01:37.097
Attack, exploration,
and logistics.

01:37.722 --> 01:41.160
Our fighting platform pairs the
efficiency and power of a robot

01:41.184 --> 01:44.330
with the ability to communicate
and intuitively bond

01:44.354 --> 01:46.373
in the familiar manner of a dog.

01:46.397 --> 01:49.502
The A-X-L's ability to carry
interchangeable payloads

01:49.526 --> 01:53.238
will make it an invaluable asset
to every branch of our military.

01:53.404 --> 01:54.404
ATTACK

01:54.531 --> 01:55.698
Trust us with this contract

01:56.324 --> 01:59.869
and we will deliver
the ultimate war dog.

02:00.203 --> 02:03.498
ATTACK EXPLORATION
LOGISTICS A-X-L

02:09.169 --> 02:11.190
Last lap. Sense of
urgency for Hill.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.900
He wants to try and
win this qualifier.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.111
Hill overtakes Fontaine
over the double jump.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.405
He's in the lead now. Oh,
no, here comes Fontaine

02:18.429 --> 02:22.142
with a cheap shot to the inside
that sends Hill off his machine.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.329
That's going to take
him out in this race.

02:25.353 --> 02:28.082
Gonna have to go to another qualifier.
He scrambles to his bike.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.358
His chain is off. That's
gonna cause him to DNF...

02:39.909 --> 02:41.220
I lost it in that last turn.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.288
Bad time to have a chain snap.
Got it?

02:46.040 --> 02:47.083
You have a spare?

02:47.667 --> 02:48.667
Buddy...

02:49.043 --> 02:50.043
This was the spare.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.052
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Love it!

03:05.018 --> 03:06.018
Yeah, baby!

03:11.733 --> 03:14.503
Thanks to sponsors
Fontaine Motorsports...

03:14.527 --> 03:15.570
I'll be right back.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.298
Visit their merchandise...

03:17.322 --> 03:19.240
That's sick, man.
Upload that right now.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.534
- Hey, good race, dude.
- Hey.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.036
- Come on.
- What?

03:23.369 --> 03:26.098
You win one race and you
think you own the track.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.767
With this team behind me, I
could win all the races.

03:28.791 --> 03:31.753
All right, let's get your act together
and get ready for the finals.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.963
Hey, fellas. Sorry to interrupt.

03:34.714 --> 03:37.985
My name is Chuck, Chuck Hill,
and this is my son, Miles.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.945
- Sup.
- Miles. Sup, dude.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.137
Tough luck on that turn, man.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.805
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.659
Tough break on that turn.
George Fontaine.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.018
George, how you doing?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.729
Listen, I'm sorry, but we
got a little favor to ask.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.273
Yeah, we...

03:53.399 --> 03:56.045
We broke our chain. Wondering
if you guys had an extra one?

03:56.069 --> 03:59.614
Oh, yeah. Those things are
always crapping out on us too.

04:00.740 --> 04:04.845
Next time, though, you might want to
spend more than 20 bucks on a chain,

04:04.869 --> 04:06.555
'cause they're
kind of important.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.515
No. We'd pay you back.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.185
- We ain't got no problem with that...
- It happens, man.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.478
Probably got a couple, right?

04:12.502 --> 04:14.702
Hey, Scroggs, get him one of
those chains in the locker.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.882
No, no, no. Hey.
We got one spare.

04:18.048 --> 04:21.302
We can't part with it. We
got another race, right?

04:21.928 --> 04:23.221
You understand.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.056
You know, I think I do.

04:25.181 --> 04:26.181
Good.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.434
All right, well, you know,
I thought we'd ask.

04:28.851 --> 04:29.851
Uh...

04:30.311 --> 04:31.896
Good luck to ya. Come on, Miles.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.063
Yep, you too.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.275
Hey, kid. Better
luck next season.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.169
You'll get it.
You're almost there.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.611
- Yeah.
- Keep working.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.782
Hey! Let's go, son!
Quit goofing around.

04:43.032 --> 04:44.409
We've got a race to win.

04:45.868 --> 04:49.247
Pick a line and go.
Come on, let's go.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.921
This what you're looking for?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.051
I wasn't here.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.014
Yo, pass me the wrench.

05:07.432 --> 05:08.432
Come on.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.267
We got this.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.689
Riders pushing their
bikes up to the gate.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.694
Ready to go, the line-up's set.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.947
- Got the best talented riders of the year.
- Okay, you're a Fontaine.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.842
- All right, you got this.
- Okay.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.119
Slow is fast, all right?
Don't miss any shifts, okay?

05:46.554 --> 05:49.223
As I say, Fontaine is
the favorite here.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.617
Let's see what he can do.

05:50.641 --> 05:53.436
Hill, the underdog, about
to drop 30 seconds.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.539
With a quick snap out of the
gate, it looks like 23,

06:13.706 --> 06:15.601
Fontaine, goes to the inside.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.044
He leads the field now
on lap number one.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.134
Riders now jockeying for
position as they come through.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.826
It's still 23, Fontaine.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.454
Looking down the twisties now.
Here they come charging down.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.707
It's still 23, Fontaine.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.729
Hill now starts to show wheel in
there as he starts to gain momentum.

07:00.753 --> 07:04.191
With good lines... Look out!
Hill now dodged the inside.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.967
Hill now takes the lead!

07:06.092 --> 07:07.260
It's Hill!

07:10.847 --> 07:12.574
Seventy-seven rider, Hill, now.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.600
Charging hard, out front.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.913
And here we go, the
race to the checkers.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.148
And Hill cruises!

07:21.190 --> 07:24.193
The winner is Hill, the 77 ride.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.325
What, are you kidding
me right now?

07:32.827 --> 07:33.827
Let's go, baby.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.516
Hey, see if you can get
my grandma on the line.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.708
She could win this thing.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.673
Hey, Hill gang.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.508
What's going on, fellas?

07:47.633 --> 07:49.570
- Nice race, Miles.
- Thanks.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.821
You too.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.615
I don't know what you're up to, but
I'm having a party at my place.

07:53.639 --> 07:55.993
You should come by.
Tons of cute girls.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.853
- Dunno, man. I got to work in the morning.
- Yeah?

07:59.520 --> 08:01.814
You got about 12 hours
between now and then.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.983
You got something better to do?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.462
Tell you what, man.
Change your mind,

08:06.486 --> 08:08.213
follow the crowd outta
here, all right?

08:08.237 --> 08:10.239
All right. I'll think about it.
Thanks, man.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.033
All right, hope to see
you there, champ.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.287
You know I'm proud
of you, right?

08:16.871 --> 08:19.975
Oh, God. Here we go.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.977
Life ain't all about
racing, you know?

08:22.001 --> 08:24.855
Sometimes you got to take your foot
off the accelerator a little bit.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.839
What, if you want to lose?

08:27.423 --> 08:30.092
That guy, his dad's got
connections, right?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.763
Connections means sponsors,
and sponsors means...

08:34.222 --> 08:36.224
Chains for days. I get it.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.059
All right, look,
I'm just saying.

08:40.937 --> 08:41.938
You really want this...

08:44.315 --> 08:45.483
you gotta play the game.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.155
CRAINE SYSTEMS

08:53.699 --> 08:54.992
Let's go, go, go!

08:55.117 --> 08:57.411
- Get that sat nav set up!
- I'm on it!

09:09.674 --> 09:10.675
God!

09:28.359 --> 09:29.527
Launch the drones.

09:30.820 --> 09:31.820
Are you sure?

09:31.862 --> 09:32.947
Launch them!

09:33.531 --> 09:34.907
We've got to track it down!

09:35.408 --> 09:37.827
Run the search protocol, and I
don't care if it's illegal!

09:40.121 --> 09:41.205
SECURITY OVERRIDE REQUIRED

09:41.872 --> 09:43.249

10:57.156 --> 10:58.156
Mom.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.676
What are you doing?

10:59.700 --> 11:01.994
I don't want to spend all
weekend cleaning up this mess.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.580
Gracias, Joanna.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.083
I'm sorry.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.189
Just go have fun,
and be careful.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.506
- Okay?
- Okay.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.032
Hey! Look who it is.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.828
- Thanks for coming, man.
- Yeah. I can't stay long, though.

11:44.078 --> 11:47.289
That's what they all say. Hey, I
want you to check something out.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.795
Yeah.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.964
Yo, everybody! Listen up!

11:55.715 --> 11:57.109
What's your name again?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.843
- Miles.
- Miles. My bad, bro.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.594
Everybody, this is Miles.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.763
He's that fool who
always beats me.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.433
Seriously, this kid's
straight sick.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.018
Didn't your dad do all
the work on your bike?

12:08.602 --> 12:10.938
Yeah. Hoping to sign
somewhere after Regionals.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.190
Maybe you can take over from me.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.067
Team Fontaine.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.610
What, you're quitting already?

12:18.320 --> 12:19.363
I don't know. Maybe.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.866
Piss my dad off enough,
that's for sure.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.528
Might be good enough reason.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.369
You guys don't get along?

12:26.245 --> 12:27.246
I wouldn't say that.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.082
He's good for some things.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.167
For example...

12:33.210 --> 12:37.214
Dad, we really need this industrial-grade
GelFire torch, you know?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.592
Really helps clear the
brush off the track.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.471
It's really gonna help me crush
the competition next season.

12:49.977 --> 12:51.228
Woo!

12:53.939 --> 12:55.316
You're crazy, man.

12:58.235 --> 13:00.070
No, man. I'm not crazy.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.156
Just primal animal, you know?

13:02.698 --> 13:06.952
Doing what our ancestors used to do.
Burn stuff, fight, be barbarians.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.038
Why don't you give it a shot?

13:11.415 --> 13:12.917
I'm good, man. You do you.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.004
All right.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.298
- Scroggins, you recording?
- Light it up!

13:33.395 --> 13:34.939
Wait, who's that guy?

13:36.857 --> 13:38.067
Never seen him before.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.195
Probably one of
Sam's new friends.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.406
You know him, he's always
expanding his pack.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.314
Hey, look at the camera.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.425
♪ I can feel it in your loving ♪

14:44.675 --> 14:48.572
♪ It's nice but not too
sweet, my darling... ♪

14:50.055 --> 14:51.473
Can't help yourself, huh?

14:54.518 --> 14:55.519
Not your scene?

14:57.229 --> 14:58.814
Wouldn't think it'd
be yours either.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.566
Didn't really have a choice.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.568
Why, because of Sam?

15:02.902 --> 15:03.902
Yeah.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.445
He was my ride home.

15:06.822 --> 15:07.990
What, you live here?

15:08.741 --> 15:09.783
In the back house.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.432
My mom takes care of the place.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.207
The Fontaines are out
of town a lot, so...

15:19.126 --> 15:20.169
So, um...

15:21.128 --> 15:22.128
you and Sam...

15:23.339 --> 15:24.339
No.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.509
No, it's not like that.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.638
I'm just the help.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.476
Trust me. That's not
the way he sees you.

15:36.518 --> 15:37.770
How does he see me?

15:38.812 --> 15:39.812
I don't know. Like...

15:40.439 --> 15:43.067
every other guy on the planet
sees you once they've seen you.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.436
Thanks for the spare
part, by the way.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.461
I appreciate that.

16:05.673 --> 16:06.799
Yeah. You're welcome.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.850
You take this out
of the garbage?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.395
It was next to it.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.772
'Cause you missed the shot.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.524
I like it.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.360
You shouldn't throw these away.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.655
She's a beauty, ain't she? Take
it out later if you're lucky.

16:29.905 --> 16:32.825
Party's kicking up to phase two and
y'all are just chilling in the garage.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.929
Listen, man, I appreciate the
invite, but I got to bounce.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.621
Nah, man. Let's
kick it up a notch.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.830
Then you can wuss out.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.167
I got a couple I wanna
introduce you to.

16:47.631 --> 16:49.174
Does it have to be so loud?

16:50.384 --> 16:51.384
Sorry?

16:53.178 --> 16:55.180
You know, when I
said, "Go have fun",

16:55.347 --> 16:58.743
"go meet some people" yesterday,
I wasn't really talking about...

16:58.767 --> 17:00.477
- I know, I know.
- Okay.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.383
Hand me that crescent, will you?

17:03.605 --> 17:04.606
Thank you.

17:05.941 --> 17:06.942
Great race yesterday.

17:07.358 --> 17:09.819
- Yeah.
- All that hard work's paying off.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.280
I guess.

17:12.321 --> 17:13.465
It just sucks, you know?

17:13.490 --> 17:16.201
I gotta bust my tail twice
as hard as those other guys.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.869
And Fontaine...

17:18.119 --> 17:20.998
Dad, you have to see
this guy's place.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.810
- He's got everything you could ever need.
- Yeah?

17:23.834 --> 17:27.146
I would be winning Supercross right
now if I had what this guy's got.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.547
It just ain't fair, is it?

17:28.839 --> 17:31.008
Look, I know. I'm just
trying to figure it all out.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.553
- Nothing feels right.
- Well, racing feels right.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.931
Yeah, but racing ain't
gonna last forever.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.184
Sooner or later you're
gonna get injured,

17:40.893 --> 17:42.186
or you're gonna age out of it.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.896
Dad, my grades were trash.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.357
We can't afford college. I
suck at everything else.

17:48.442 --> 17:49.442
But this...

17:49.526 --> 17:50.819
This I'm good at.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.447
Yeah.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.493
But how many other things
have you actually tried?

18:08.212 --> 18:09.880
We've been searching all night.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.234
Could be anywhere within a
100-mile radius by now.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.862
There's nothing I can do
until we get a visual on it.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.429
All its comm links are down.

18:20.516 --> 18:23.352
Keep them off the servers. I don't
want them finding out about this.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.817
Captain Webber.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.777
The demo is in two days.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.071
Do you have any idea
what's on the line here?

18:34.196 --> 18:36.448
- Of course.
- Then give me a straight answer.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.243
You've blown through
a $70 million budget

18:39.368 --> 18:41.954
and we haven't seen anything
close to battlefield-ready.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.266
It's evolving. We've
made great strides here.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.460
It's showing levels of autonomy
way beyond expectation.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.879
The US government has
expectations, Andric.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.257
You promised us a machine
that could kill.

18:53.882 --> 18:57.928
I'm going to need remote access to
your lab and the asset immediately.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.763
After that, you're done.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.974
- Am I clear?
- Crystal.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.294
Hey, buddy. Radiator
dirty again?

19:31.712 --> 19:34.274
I think I'm going
to get some sleep.

19:34.298 --> 19:37.176
Nah, what you're about to do is come
out to Beaumont's ranch with us.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.386
Rip some gnarly whips
for Scroggins' camera.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.890
Share your talents with the world, kid.
You're about to blow up.

19:43.682 --> 19:44.682
Come on.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.399
Sick, bro!

19:55.694 --> 19:57.321
Yo, Miles. Come check this out.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.824
That's super sick. Watch this.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.200
There you go.

20:02.492 --> 20:05.162
Dude, that was huge. Yeah,
I can't wait to post this.

20:05.370 --> 20:06.747
You're gonna get
signed for sure.

20:07.748 --> 20:11.561
Nah, people don't get signed off
desert rat hillbilly crap like this.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.296
We'll see about that.
That was sick, dude.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.925
Hey, you should come down
to Nationals with us.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.593
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.905
Took a private jet
down last year.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.263
- It was awesome.
- Huh.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.118
You and Sara have
fun last night?

20:27.142 --> 20:29.186
- We were just talking.
- Just talking, huh?

20:29.311 --> 20:30.812
Yeah. No biggie.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.916
- Check out this one, man.
- Yeah?

20:32.940 --> 20:34.107
- Yeah.
- All right.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.277
Oh, Miles, before I forget.

20:37.527 --> 20:39.780
Why don't you say something
for your fans, bro?

20:40.572 --> 20:41.572
Uh...

20:41.615 --> 20:42.615
Yeah, all right.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.325
Um...

20:44.451 --> 20:45.803
Yo, send it.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.079
Yeah.

20:47.871 --> 20:48.871
I get it, dude.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.710
Let's see it!

20:54.461 --> 20:55.587
Send it.

21:07.933 --> 21:08.933
Whoa!

21:14.523 --> 21:15.857
Hey, dude! You okay?

21:17.776 --> 21:19.987
That's not how you make a
name for yourself, man.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.155
You got it, Scroggs?

21:22.531 --> 21:23.811
All right. Let's get outta here.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.994
- But he's got my GoPro.
- Your GoPro?

21:27.327 --> 21:28.327
Who paid for it?

21:29.246 --> 21:31.373
We can't just leave him
out here like that.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.505
You're right.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.049
I'm not leaving him
here like that.

21:44.469 --> 21:45.469

No.

39:44.298 --> 39:45.466
I just like the drive.

39:47.259 --> 39:48.259
Hmm!

39:48.302 --> 39:49.302
Yeah?

39:50.721 --> 39:52.014
I was worried about you.

40:06.529 --> 40:09.323
It's crazy what the military
chooses to spend their money on.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.326
You really think he's military?

40:12.993 --> 40:14.036
Yeah.

40:15.162 --> 40:16.264
Maybe.

40:16.288 --> 40:19.458
I mean, clearly somebody
spent a lot of money on him.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.794
And they gotta be
looking for him.

40:23.671 --> 40:24.839
Whatever he is,

40:25.423 --> 40:27.258
we gotta take him
back to his owner.

40:27.508 --> 40:29.343
What, for like a reward?

40:29.885 --> 40:32.054
No, because it's the
right thing to do.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.854
You see all those little round
things on his side and on his tail?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.398
You know those are
bullet holes, right?

40:43.607 --> 40:44.984
Somebody shot him up.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.654
I don't think his owner
deserves to get him back.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.159
I think he's listening.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.495
You listening to us?

40:57.997 --> 40:59.039
It's okay.

40:59.498 --> 41:00.875
We'll figure this out.

41:10.342 --> 41:11.760
Are you scared of the dark?

41:13.721 --> 41:14.555
No.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.241
No? Are you sure?

41:16.265 --> 41:17.683
I am scared of my mom, though.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.769
Well...

41:21.312 --> 41:23.981
You know, we can't get the
truck out until the morning.

41:25.357 --> 41:26.650
Yeah, good point.

41:27.276 --> 41:28.986
You tell your mom
you came out here?

41:29.987 --> 41:30.987
Nope.

41:32.364 --> 41:33.491
She'd freak out.

41:34.700 --> 41:37.369
Yeah, my dad's probably
freaking out too.

41:38.913 --> 41:39.955
And your mom?

41:44.710 --> 41:46.378
She died a couple years ago.

41:51.842 --> 41:52.927
I'm so sorry.

41:54.094 --> 41:55.094
Yeah.

41:58.390 --> 41:59.725
I'll show you a picture.

42:04.563 --> 42:05.689
She's beautiful.

42:07.441 --> 42:08.776
My dad married up.

42:10.819 --> 42:12.196
Yeah, my dad too.

42:13.155 --> 42:15.366
It's too bad. I don't
know much about him.

42:16.784 --> 42:21.097
Other than that he's been in and
out of my life since I was a kid.

42:21.121 --> 42:23.082
Hardest part is watching
my mom go through it.

42:26.043 --> 42:29.088
It's like she's completely given
up on ever getting out of here.

42:30.839 --> 42:32.091
I know how she feels.

42:34.843 --> 42:37.888
I mean, sometimes I feel like I'll
never get out of here either.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.487
I really like this song.

42:55.906 --> 42:56.907
Come on.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.846
♪ We get it on... ♪

43:01.870 --> 43:03.038
You see that?

43:05.791 --> 43:08.144
- Come on.
- I don't... I don't really dance.

43:08.168 --> 43:09.938
- Everyone can dance.
- That's more your thing.

43:09.962 --> 43:12.214
- Not really my thing.
- You're just choosing not to.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.760
♪ Everybody here is

43:17.595 --> 43:19.513

- Just a sway.

43:20.514 --> 43:21.557
There we go.

43:22.057 --> 43:24.602
Okay, now we can get fancy.

43:25.227 --> 43:26.895
Add a little snap to it.

43:29.064 --> 43:30.941
♪ Dancing in the moonlight ♪

43:31.400 --> 43:35.213

SARA REYES 10198
MILES HILL 10298

43:52.713 --> 43:55.358
Okay, so they're late on truck
payments and medical bills.

43:55.382 --> 43:58.445
She actually got accepted to
a few good schools, but...

43:58.469 --> 44:00.509
Her mother's totally underwater.
Look, the point is,

44:00.638 --> 44:02.640
they'll be thankful for
anything they can get.

44:02.848 --> 44:05.809
We should send the boys in there, pay
them off, and take back the A-X-L.

44:05.976 --> 44:06.976
No.

44:07.311 --> 44:08.311
No?

44:08.729 --> 44:12.399
He's becoming more sophisticated with
every minute he spends in human contact.

44:12.858 --> 44:14.943
We were six months
behind schedule.

44:15.277 --> 44:18.614
This level of development
puts us ahead five years.

44:27.247 --> 44:28.457
She's pretty great, huh?

44:32.836 --> 44:34.296
Way out of my league,
though, right?

44:36.131 --> 44:39.301
Yo... send it!

44:40.094 --> 44:41.595
You don't have to rub it in.

44:55.442 --> 44:56.527
Keep going.

44:57.069 --> 44:58.070
Keep going.

45:02.991 --> 45:03.991
Almost there!

45:05.202 --> 45:06.202
Keep going.

45:08.163 --> 45:10.332
Let's go! That's what
I'm talking about.

45:14.294 --> 45:15.713
All right, let's get outta here!

45:16.422 --> 45:17.464
What about AXL?

45:18.215 --> 45:19.633
We can't just leave
him out here.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.593
What do you wanna do?
Take him home?

45:22.094 --> 45:25.240
Miles, he's not some kind of
stray dog that you just found.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.992
- He can hurt someone.
- We do what you said last night, okay?

45:28.016 --> 45:30.644
We find out who made him.
Come on, give it.

45:30.978 --> 45:31.978
Hey, give it!

45:34.189 --> 45:35.983
You know you're using
the word "we" a lot?

45:36.316 --> 45:38.294
That's because we're
in this together.

45:38.318 --> 45:40.612
I came out here to make
sure you were okay.

45:41.530 --> 45:43.591
- That thing...
- Needs our help, all right?

45:43.615 --> 45:46.660
Besides, if we just
leave him out here,

45:46.910 --> 45:49.347
what do you think'll happen to
the next guy who finds him?

45:49.371 --> 45:51.725
I don't know. We'll call the cops.
Let them deal with it.

45:51.749 --> 45:52.726
Call the cops?

45:52.750 --> 45:55.520
You saw how he reacted to this truck.
What do you think he's gonna do

45:55.544 --> 45:57.880
when he sees a bunch of
police cars coming up here?

45:59.757 --> 46:00.757
Come on.

46:02.342 --> 46:03.342
Fine.

46:05.471 --> 46:06.472
So you're with me?

46:09.183 --> 46:10.183
Yes.

46:10.726 --> 46:11.726
Well, good.

46:12.561 --> 46:13.561
Hey, AXL!

46:16.023 --> 46:17.274
Atta baby.

46:20.778 --> 46:21.779
Hey, Dad.

46:23.530 --> 46:25.574
Sorry, I just got back
into cell service.

46:26.950 --> 46:29.828
Yeah, he messed up my bike and
then he just left me out there.

46:30.537 --> 46:31.537
No.

46:32.539 --> 46:34.500
Listen, I got to talk
to you later, okay?

46:34.917 --> 46:36.168
I'll be home in a bit.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.086
All right? Okay, bye.

46:42.424 --> 46:44.486
Do you have any cash?
I only have a five.

46:44.510 --> 46:45.510
No.

46:46.595 --> 46:48.347
Hang on. Let me check
the glove compartment.

46:51.683 --> 46:53.685
HACKING PROGRESS
INITIATING TRANSACTION

46:54.937 --> 46:57.898
Wait, you didn't pay already?
It says you did.

47:05.072 --> 47:06.573
Wait, did he just buy us gas?

47:07.407 --> 47:08.659
Looks like he did.

47:10.202 --> 47:12.621
See? I told you we couldn't
leave him out there.

47:13.872 --> 47:15.874
He hacked the gas pumps
like he had your card.

47:17.042 --> 47:19.545
I couldn't even get my last
dog to stay off the couch!

47:25.467 --> 47:27.469
TRANSACTION INITIATED

47:32.015 --> 47:34.077
Look, buddy, you gotta
stay down, all right?

47:40.524 --> 47:41.567
I think we should go.

47:41.859 --> 47:43.336
It won't stop.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.778
That's good. Just take it all.

47:50.951 --> 47:52.953
Look at this.

47:53.161 --> 47:54.913
Dollar bills!

48:07.801 --> 48:10.405
Sam? Have you seen Sara?

48:10.429 --> 48:13.473
She spent the night at Lyssa's, but
I thought she'd be home by now.

48:13.599 --> 48:15.601
I don't think she's at Lyssa's.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.854
She's probably hanging
out with this new kid.

48:19.271 --> 48:21.565
You know, there's a way you
can find her on your phone.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.066
You want me to show you how?

48:23.734 --> 48:24.943
Yeah, sure, please.

48:25.319 --> 48:26.319
Okay.

48:26.612 --> 48:29.114
You just gotta go there...

48:30.240 --> 48:31.783
SARA REYES

48:31.909 --> 48:34.578
Yeah, there she is. Right there.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.997
But that looks like the
middle of nowhere.

48:38.332 --> 48:39.833
Balance it. Balance it.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.668
There you go.

48:42.336 --> 48:43.336
Flip it.

48:45.172 --> 48:46.590
You sure he'll be safe here?

48:46.757 --> 48:48.383
Yeah, I think he should
be fine tonight.

48:50.218 --> 48:52.179
No one really comes
here except for me.

48:53.847 --> 48:55.140
So you did all these?

48:55.724 --> 48:56.725
Yeah.

48:57.017 --> 48:59.436
They're amazing. You're
really talented.

49:48.485 --> 49:50.320
- Did you know he could do that?
- No.

49:50.445 --> 49:51.738
This is something new.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.675
The Department of Defense,

49:53.699 --> 49:55.659
in collaboration
with CRAINE Systems,

49:55.951 --> 49:58.996
is pleased to present
the A-X-L...

49:59.913 --> 50:03.500
which exceeds any UGV
module available today.

50:04.543 --> 50:07.814
The AXL has been engineered
upon a foundation

50:07.838 --> 50:12.092
of canine human interaction
that stretches back millennia.

50:13.427 --> 50:15.262
As the war dog of the future,

50:15.637 --> 50:19.266
the A-X-L biometrically pairs
with a designated soldier,

50:20.142 --> 50:22.185
making him as loyal
as the real thing

50:22.644 --> 50:24.521
while being decisively
more lethal.

50:26.648 --> 50:29.109
Specially engineered
vehicles and accessories

50:29.234 --> 50:31.838
give the soldier that the
A-X-L is paired with

50:31.862 --> 50:35.574
enhanced mobility and faster
evasive opportunities.

50:36.575 --> 50:40.263
A suite of cyber warfare
abilities make him an ally

50:40.287 --> 50:42.122
in disarmament and intelligence.

50:42.581 --> 50:44.221
- Miles, he was made to...
- Yeah, I know.

50:44.458 --> 50:49.355
The A-X-L not only has the ability
to source and direct maintenance,

50:49.379 --> 50:54.152
but also to self-destruct in
order to avoid enemy capture.

50:54.176 --> 50:57.054
AXL... AXL, stop, okay?

51:01.933 --> 51:02.933
Don't touch it.

51:08.607 --> 51:10.025
Of course, he touches it.

51:12.652 --> 51:13.652
Ow!

51:21.328 --> 51:22.829
What do you think this is?

51:22.954 --> 51:24.164
PAIRED

51:24.581 --> 51:27.060
Clearly he just did that
pairing thing with you.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.561
It's paired now.

51:28.585 --> 51:31.272
The entire OS is useless
without that kid.

51:31.296 --> 51:34.466
The key gives him full control
of the entire project.

51:35.217 --> 51:37.052
Then we bring in
the kid as well.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.096

51:46.228 --> 51:47.729
- It's Sam.
- Hey.

51:48.939 --> 51:51.316
I need you to stay here, all right?
I'll be right back.

51:51.775 --> 51:53.610
Miles, you're gonna
have to stay here too.

51:53.735 --> 51:56.335
- I'm not hiding from him.
- If he sees you, he's gonna freak out.

51:56.738 --> 51:57.864
I got this, okay?

52:04.329 --> 52:06.206
- Hey!
- Hey.

52:06.748 --> 52:09.042
What kind of sketchy business
goes on up here, huh?

52:09.584 --> 52:10.836
You know me.

52:11.545 --> 52:12.921
Do I?

52:13.463 --> 52:16.174
What happened, Sara? You
guys hang out or what?

52:17.634 --> 52:18.802
What's that supposed to mean?

52:19.344 --> 52:21.346
You know, I'm used to
people using me, Sara.

52:22.139 --> 52:23.849
I just... didn't
think it'd be you.

52:24.766 --> 52:26.309
I guess it makes sense, though.

52:26.935 --> 52:27.978
How have I used you?

52:28.353 --> 52:30.522
Well, you act like
we're together.

52:31.314 --> 52:32.625
You suck up to my dad.

52:32.649 --> 52:35.152
My family practically gives
you and your mom everything,

52:35.360 --> 52:36.671
and the minute I turn my back,

52:36.695 --> 52:38.864
you go and you hook up with
some piece of white trash.

52:40.282 --> 52:41.282
Hey.

52:42.742 --> 52:44.161
Hey, Sara. Hey!

52:46.371 --> 52:48.748
Sam, you need to leave... now!

52:49.541 --> 52:50.750
What, because of this kid?

52:51.418 --> 52:52.418
Sup, Miles?

52:52.836 --> 52:54.004
Nice tan, bro.

52:59.718 --> 53:03.239
Okay, this has gone far enough. We
need to get a team in there right now.

53:03.263 --> 53:04.263
Hold on.

53:04.723 --> 53:06.057
Let's see this play out.

53:10.312 --> 53:12.647
Miles, tell him to stop.
He's gonna kill him!

53:13.773 --> 53:14.941
It's crushing me!

53:15.358 --> 53:17.777
- Come on!
- Okay. AXL!

53:19.154 --> 53:20.322
Bring him here.

53:24.910 --> 53:25.910
Help! No!

53:27.078 --> 53:29.473
AXL, stop! Miles!

53:34.878 --> 53:37.172
I'd stay as still possible right
now if I were you, buddy.

53:37.380 --> 53:39.549
- Miles, just let him go!
- Listen to me.

53:39.674 --> 53:42.236
I don't ever want to see you
near her again. You got that?

53:42.260 --> 53:44.262
- Miles, just let him go!
- And if I do,

53:44.763 --> 53:47.307
- I'm gonna send this thing after you.
- Okay!

53:47.432 --> 53:50.101
- I can't hear you. What'd you say?
- I said, okay!

53:51.937 --> 53:54.272
He's all right. You can't hurt him.
Okay?

53:54.856 --> 53:56.066
Get outta here. Go!

53:56.191 --> 53:58.944
The asset obeyed the boy's
directives perfectly.

54:00.028 --> 54:01.028
Let him go.

54:03.323 --> 54:04.991
SAM FONTAINE DO NOT HARM

54:05.158 --> 54:06.158
PROTECTED

54:08.119 --> 54:11.665
And what if he had directed
him to keep attacking?

54:12.791 --> 54:14.125
You better run!

54:15.543 --> 54:18.105
We could have had civilian
blood on our hands.

54:18.129 --> 54:20.090
At some point, I'd say
that's inevitable.

54:25.220 --> 54:27.097
And that doesn't bother you?

54:28.848 --> 54:31.059
Perhaps you've forgotten
what business we're in.

54:32.102 --> 54:33.520
Aren't you a good boy?

54:34.479 --> 54:35.814
That was fun, right?

54:37.941 --> 54:38.941
What?

54:40.819 --> 54:42.487
I told you I'd handle it.

54:43.613 --> 54:45.174
Hey, I was just
looking out for you.

54:45.198 --> 54:46.574
Well, I don't need you to.

54:46.825 --> 54:47.826
Don't you get it?

54:48.535 --> 54:50.036
I live in his house.

54:50.412 --> 54:53.516
My mom does his laundry, they pay
for my grandmother's nursing home.

54:53.540 --> 54:54.725
They own us, Miles.

54:54.749 --> 54:56.469
- I was just trying to defend you...
- Stop!

54:56.501 --> 54:58.020
You act like you're
the underdog,

54:58.044 --> 55:00.588
but the moment you get any real
power, you're just like him!

55:01.172 --> 55:03.526
You just dropped bombs
all over a situation

55:03.550 --> 55:05.635
my family's been dealing
with our entire lives.

55:09.764 --> 55:11.057
I'm sorry, okay?

55:14.144 --> 55:15.312
I let it get out of hand.

55:19.190 --> 55:20.190
Look...

55:20.984 --> 55:22.902
Just go make peace
with him, okay?

55:23.486 --> 55:24.738
I'll take care of AXL.

55:25.155 --> 55:26.656
Did you hit your
head or something?

55:27.032 --> 55:28.700
Or are you just
choosing not to use it?

55:30.327 --> 55:32.120
I'm not going to
leave you, Miles.

55:33.621 --> 55:35.349
And I'm not leaving you, AXL.

55:35.373 --> 55:36.373
ANALYZING VITALS

55:36.833 --> 55:38.084
Look, do you trust your dad?

55:39.127 --> 55:40.127
Yeah.

55:40.503 --> 55:42.505
Okay, well, I think
we need to tell him.

55:42.714 --> 55:45.175
Because clearly, we're
way in over our heads.

55:47.844 --> 55:48.844
All right.

55:50.638 --> 55:54.142
Okay, bud, I need you to
hide over there, okay?

55:54.893 --> 55:56.162
We'll be right back.

55:56.186 --> 55:59.230
Just stay here. And don't
do anything stupid, please.

56:01.983 --> 56:03.318
Ah! Stay.

56:22.837 --> 56:25.465
You're saying you just
found a robot dog?

56:25.632 --> 56:27.008
I want you to see him, Dad.

56:27.926 --> 56:29.177
What is this thing?

56:29.511 --> 56:32.013
It makes the person who touches
it his owner or something.

56:32.430 --> 56:33.807
- And you touched it.
- Yeah.

56:34.516 --> 56:36.142
He has to obey
everything I say now.

56:54.244 --> 56:55.453
All right, everybody.

56:58.456 --> 56:59.456
You ready?

57:01.042 --> 57:02.210
You guys stay here.

57:03.169 --> 57:04.671
- Ready, Scroggins?
- Yeah.

57:06.631 --> 57:08.258
Get your camera ready. Let's go.

57:09.426 --> 57:11.469
You're tripping. I
don't see anything.

57:11.636 --> 57:13.138
No, man. He's in here.

57:23.565 --> 57:25.400
Just keep that
camera rolling, man.

57:47.922 --> 57:49.358
ANALYZING

57:49.382 --> 57:51.759
- Right, you got that?
- Yeah, I'm getting it.

57:52.010 --> 57:53.636
I'm not kidding
about this thing.

57:56.931 --> 57:58.308
What's the ETA on
the operatives?

58:00.018 --> 58:02.562
Both teams are still two
hours and 30 minutes out.

58:06.065 --> 58:08.067
Hey, bud. Hey.

58:08.818 --> 58:10.403
You remember me, right?

58:13.198 --> 58:14.782
What do you think we should do?

58:15.116 --> 58:17.744
I sure would like to see this thing.
He sounds...

58:18.161 --> 58:19.579
Sounds like a piece of work.

58:19.787 --> 58:22.457
But you wanna know what
I think you should do?

58:23.625 --> 58:25.084
What you should
do is turn it in.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.229
- What?
- I'm sorry...

58:27.253 --> 58:30.024
No, Dad. No. They're going
to use him to kill people.

58:30.048 --> 58:33.194
It's the United States military.
Miles, that's what they do.

58:33.218 --> 58:34.844
They build stuff
that kills people.

58:34.969 --> 58:36.405
It's not Finders Keepers, pal.

58:36.429 --> 58:38.365
- He ran away.
- You don't know that.

58:38.389 --> 58:41.429
He could've fallen off the back of a
truck out there in the desert somewhere.

58:41.476 --> 58:44.896
- He could have just got away.
- No, he's riddled with bullet holes, Dad.

58:45.021 --> 58:47.625
- They were abusing him.
- It's a robot.

58:47.649 --> 58:49.776
How do you abuse a robot?
I don't even know.

58:55.198 --> 58:56.133
It's okay.

58:56.157 --> 58:57.051
ANALYZING

58:57.075 --> 58:58.075
Yeah.

58:58.326 --> 58:59.577
I just brought some friends.

59:00.828 --> 59:02.372
We'll clean this up real quick.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.255
Yeah. Here you go, buddy.

59:10.838 --> 59:11.838
Yeah.

59:13.299 --> 59:14.884
Come on, right here.

59:15.718 --> 59:16.718
Come here.

59:16.970 --> 59:17.905
Attaboy.

59:17.929 --> 59:18.929
CAPTURE

59:21.808 --> 59:22.808
Yeah.

59:24.352 --> 59:26.354
Good boy. Come on,
bring it back.

59:31.859 --> 59:32.859
Come on.

59:36.739 --> 59:38.700
Good boy. Dude, you got this?

59:42.161 --> 59:44.557
That's right. Good boy.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.249
Dude, the thing's gonna kill us.

59:46.374 --> 59:48.835
No, man. He can't.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.795
Keep your camera rolling.

59:51.129 --> 59:52.630
Wouldn't want Sara to miss this.

59:53.673 --> 59:55.818
Miles, you need to
understand something, okay?

59:55.842 --> 59:57.695
It's a robot, right?

59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.013
- That's what you said.
- It's an intelligent robot, Dad.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:01.639
I'm telling you,
he feels things.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.518
This is a weapon. You've
got a loaded gun.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.019
Okay?

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.498
Think about what
you're going to do.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:11.667
- Let's just go. This is crazy.
- No, no, no, man.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:14.110
He wants to play. You know?

01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:17.488
Yeah.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:19.490
Yeah.

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:22.577
Seen one of these?

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:23.744
Huh?

01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:25.955
Pretty cool, right?

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:29.292
Kind of like you, you know?

01:00:30.209 --> 01:00:33.129
All metal and shiny
and dangerous.

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:35.524

01:00:35.548 --> 01:00:37.216
Move. Let me see this.

01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:40.470
Nothing to worry about. Yeah.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.722
Not gonna hurt ya.

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:46.410
You're letting your feelings
cloud your judgment, okay?

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.186
- Miles.
- You gotta slow down.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.311
- Miles.
- What?

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.481
We have to go. Now.

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:53.524
Dad, just forget
about it, all right?

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:55.652
Come here. Wait. Whoa!
Where you going?

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:04.035

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:36.061
Who's asking?

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.463
We're investigating the theft
of some classified technology.

01:02:38.629 --> 01:02:39.909
So, are you with the government?

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.484

- No.

01:02:46.095 --> 01:02:47.180
a warrant...

01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:49.807
or a gun.

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:52.745
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:53.769
Okay.

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.358
- Push it.
- Okay.

Where do you think
he's taking us?

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.113
I don't know. I guess
we'll find out.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:06.824
Have you seen this device
in your son's possession?

01:03:07.366 --> 01:03:09.494
He keeps all his
stuff in the garage.

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:12.162
Don't move.

01:03:21.672 --> 01:03:23.299
We should go. Come on.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.736
Turn off the lights and
don't hit the brakes.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.362

01:03:27.386 --> 01:03:29.667
Just follow AXL's directions.
He'll know where to take us.

Hey!

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.539

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.463
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay, okay, we're coming!

01:11:01.632 --> 01:11:03.318
Yeah! Hey, listen.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:06.071
If you're not turned already,
then it's time to get turned.

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.141
Let's get this lit!

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:16.623
Woo!

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.023
All right, man. Enjoy.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:27.740
Dude!

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:49.555
- Start the car!
- Keys!

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.473
- What was that?
- Come on!

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:44.067
AXL?

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.070
Stop!

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:02.877
- No!
- Stop!

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:09.133
No, no!

01:13:09.426 --> 01:13:11.428

No, no, no!

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:14.699
- Sam!
- AXL, stop!

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.183
- Knock it off!
- Stop!

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:17.744
This isn't right.

01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:19.728
You can't hurt him.
You need to leave.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.940
Okay. Good boy.

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:33.325
Miles, what's happening?

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:12.864
Let's go!

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.250
Ow!

AXL? AXL, you there?

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.982
Wake up, please. You got
to get me out of here.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:31.944
It really feels alive
to you, doesn't it?

01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:34.112
What are you doing to him?

01:15:34.279 --> 01:15:37.241
Well, I've got your buddy under control,
but I'm having a little problem.

01:15:42.996 --> 01:15:44.498
Does that look familiar?

01:15:45.123 --> 01:15:48.937
Well, I want it back. And if you
want to get out of here alive,

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:49.962
you'll give it to me.

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:53.048
So, where is it, Mr. Hill?

01:15:54.132 --> 01:15:55.509
She'd better be okay.

01:15:56.468 --> 01:15:57.468
You hear me?

01:15:57.678 --> 01:16:00.698
Or I'm gonna make sure everyone
knows what you've been doing here.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:02.140
And what have I been doing?

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:06.162
Aside from giving our men on the
battlefield a fighting chance

01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:07.580

01:16:13.443 --> 01:16:14.820
This is a machine.

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:19.491
A computer program that obeys
lines of code that I've written.

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:27.374

01:16:46.643 --> 01:16:49.914
One step outside this box and
your little friend will attack.

know where it is.

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.164

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:53.061
You have 30 seconds to exit and
surrender control of the asset,

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.689

Is there something
I should know?

01:26:11.624 --> 01:26:16.296
You compromised national security
and endangered civilian lives.

01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:21.217
- So you'll be all right without me?
- I'll try.

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:24.637
- Are you going to get arrested?
- Probably not.
