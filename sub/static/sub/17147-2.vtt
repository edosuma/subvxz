Aw, dude, come on.
We just want burritos.

19:20.702 --> 19:23.413
Yeah? I just wanna know
why I gotta stay in this shack all day

19:23.497 --> 19:24.873
even though we're closed.

19:24.957 --> 19:25.999
Thanks, Columbus!

19:26.083 --> 19:29.503
Hey, Danny, was yesterday
Columbus Day, too?

19:29.586 --> 19:31.421
Great idea, Fyootch!

19:31.505 --> 19:33.715
Let's go back to yesterday
when it was open!

19:34.716 --> 19:36.969
Burritos, here we come.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.015
(BOTH SCREAMING)

19:43.058 --> 19:45.185
-(GROANS)
-Whoa!

19:45.269 --> 19:47.604
Yesterday sure got a lot beachier.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.731
Time storm must've blown us off-course.

19:49.815 --> 19:51.441
We could be anywhere, any-when.

19:51.525 --> 19:52.526
(SPITS)

19:52.609 --> 19:54.027
Just how I like it.

19:54.111 --> 19:56.405
Look! And it's open!

19:56.488 --> 19:59.700
Take that, Christopher Columbus. Idiot.

20:00.409 --> 20:03.161
(WHOOPING)

20:03.245 --> 20:06.874
I claim this land in the name of me,
Christopher Columbus.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.501
Henceforth, today shall be Columbus Day,

20:09.585 --> 20:11.503
and all stores must close.

20:11.587 --> 20:13.130
(GASPS) Not again!

20:13.213 --> 20:15.257
Quick! Two burritos, and step on it.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.759
You dare dishonor Columbus Day?

20:17.843 --> 20:20.304
Have at you now, burrito stand!

20:20.387 --> 20:23.015
-(GRUNTING)
-(CRASHES)

20:24.808 --> 20:26.351
Oh, that was pretty lame, dude.

20:26.435 --> 20:28.770
Be still, my greedy heart!

20:28.854 --> 20:32.399
This gold is mine!
All mine! (LAUGHING)

20:32.482 --> 20:34.818
Sandy cheese? Sandy beans?

20:34.902 --> 20:36.653
Christopher Columbus, you're the worst.

20:36.737 --> 20:39.907
Yeah! How you like
these abs, sucker? (GRUNTS)

20:39.990 --> 20:41.283
Hang on, I've got an idea.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.160
Hey, Columbus,
you like "gold," huh?

20:43.243 --> 20:47.247
I'll get you tons of gold if you
change your name to Christopher Burrito.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.416
"Burrito"?

20:49.499 --> 20:53.879
Buh-rito. Bur-ee-toe. Hmm.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.422
It is a deal, young sir!

20:55.506 --> 20:56.673
Cool. Be right back.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.969
Here's your precious "gold,"
Christopher Burrito.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.639
(LAUGHING) Gold!

21:04.765 --> 21:07.309
(SPITS) What japery is this?

21:07.392 --> 21:09.394
I changed my name for chocolate?

21:09.478 --> 21:10.771
It's a binding contract.

21:10.854 --> 21:13.148
No take-backs, sucker! (LAUGHS)

21:14.608 --> 21:16.818
(EXCLAIMS) Not fair!

21:19.821 --> 21:21.949
Whoa, it worked! You're open!

21:22.032 --> 21:24.368
'Course I am. Today's Burrito Day,

21:24.451 --> 21:26.995
on account of
Christopher Burrito discoverin' America.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.121
And?

21:28.205 --> 21:31.792
And everybody gets a free burrito!

21:31.875 --> 21:33.293
Yes! Burrito Day rules!

21:33.377 --> 21:34.378
-Nice one.
-Whoo!

21:34.461 --> 21:36.213
