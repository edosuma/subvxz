00:02.500 --> 00:05.572
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:07.140 --> 01:08.459
CHUCKLES

01:08.540 --> 01:12.169
Scatter! Party!

01:20.780 --> 01:24.489
(Lillian) 'My Brendan were a strapping lad
as a youngster.

01:24.580 --> 01:27.458
'Arms like hams. Shapely in the leg.

01:27.540 --> 01:30.976
'Had a look of a young
John Nettles without the hair.

01:31.060 --> 01:34.370
'Bergerac period,
not Midsomer - no, ta.

01:34.460 --> 01:36.894
'Gone to seed by then.

01:36.980 --> 01:40.575
'Dream fella, Brendan.
Knew he were t'one for me.

01:40.660 --> 01:43.015
'Took months to wear him down.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.773
'So handsome.
All t'girls wanted him.'

01:48.940 --> 01:52.410
(Norma) Fuck off, Worzel!
Do you have to do that every night?

01:52.500 --> 01:53.694
It's Lillian!

01:53.780 --> 01:54.735
Lillian?

01:56.620 --> 01:57.575
It's really late!

01:57.660 --> 02:00.970
I've been clubbing,
but I think there's a burst gas main.

02:01.060 --> 02:02.379
Smell it?

02:02.460 --> 02:05.099
(Lillian) 'I was so certain
we were meant to be together.

02:05.180 --> 02:07.057
'He got bored arguing and gave in.

02:07.140 --> 02:11.258
'And we were largely happy - apart
from the affairs and the drinking.'

SIRENS WAIL

02:13.940 --> 02:14.577
What the fuck?!

02:14.660 --> 02:17.094
'There's only room
for one great love in my life.'

02:17.180 --> 02:19.250
Clear the area! Wake everyone!

02:19.340 --> 02:21.649
'... but there's plenty of time
for a few small ones.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.890
'I bloody hope so, anyway.'

02:23.980 --> 02:24.651
Fire brigade!

02:24.740 --> 02:26.412
'I really miss me cock.'

02:26.500 --> 02:27.728
KNOCK ON DOOR

02:27.820 --> 02:32.177
Fire brigade! Fire brigade!
Fire brigade!

02:33.900 --> 02:35.777
Clot on the sofa's
trying to light a fag, boss!

02:35.860 --> 02:38.215
Fire brigade! Stand away!

02:38.300 --> 02:40.894
Hang on... hang on... Oh!

02:40.980 --> 02:42.095
Coming through!

02:44.540 --> 02:45.893
Fucking hell!

02:49.380 --> 02:52.053
I think we've found our burst main.

02:59.340 --> 03:02.889
Ribbons! Blood! MY blood!

03:02.980 --> 03:03.776
Are you all right, Dad?

03:03.860 --> 03:06.579
Get a bucket! I don't want to cause a mess

03:06.660 --> 03:08.298
while I'm bleeding to fucking death!

03:08.380 --> 03:11.338
Ooooh, chin up, love!
Baby doesn't like blood.

03:11.420 --> 03:14.651
Oh, fucking hell, it's Bo Selecta -
I'm having a bad dream!

03:14.740 --> 03:16.332
Should have let you suffocate!

03:16.420 --> 03:17.057
Aaagh!

03:17.140 --> 03:19.370
< John - upstairs -
open some windows.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.176
< Yes, Boss.

03:20.260 --> 03:21.249
What's with the torsos?

03:21.340 --> 03:22.819
Doing a hen night.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.128
Do you know how much we're paid?

03:24.220 --> 03:25.494
'Kin hell! He's bleating -

03:25.580 --> 03:28.140
I'm the one looking
at the stairway to heaven here!

03:28.220 --> 03:29.335
< We'll drop him at the hospital.

03:29.420 --> 03:33.811
Oh, what - all the ambulances
mobile DJs, are they, this evening?

03:33.900 --> 03:35.492
Come on. Anyone going with him?

03:35.580 --> 03:38.811
Are you mad? They know him down
at casualty better than we do!

03:38.900 --> 03:42.859
Oh cheers, progeny! Beloved spawn...

03:42.940 --> 03:45.693
So-called... Ioved one!

03:47.220 --> 03:49.939
Right, I'm off to my pit.

03:50.020 --> 03:53.410
Mum's got Katie to give me
a full night for a change.

03:53.500 --> 03:57.573
I won't be able to kip, now.
All those firemen!

03:57.660 --> 03:59.890
Yeah! Cliche, but I'd do 'em!

03:59.980 --> 04:01.254
I'll have one of them.

04:01.340 --> 04:03.774
HORN BLARES

04:03.860 --> 04:06.977
ENGINE SOUNDS

04:07.060 --> 04:09.972
Pissed off without me, again.

04:11.140 --> 04:12.368
Does that happen a lot?

04:12.460 --> 04:13.734
Arseholes!

04:13.820 --> 04:14.889
< Brew?

04:14.980 --> 04:15.935
Have you got anything stronger?

04:16.019 --> 04:17.692
With my dad in the house?
No chance!

04:17.779 --> 04:22.251
Thought you'd be all "Don't drink
on duty, Ma'am - babies to save".

04:22.340 --> 04:26.811
I'm not on duty. We were passing,
thought we'd check it out, save the boys a trip.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.777
You the couple of the house?

04:28.860 --> 04:30.976
Not even close.

04:31.060 --> 04:32.254
I'm single.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.535
What, brother and sister?

04:34.620 --> 04:37.657
I don't know why I even bother asking
questions about families. They're all so...

04:37.740 --> 04:38.695
Fucked.

04:38.780 --> 04:40.008
Yeah.

04:42.340 --> 04:43.534
HORN BLARES

04:43.620 --> 04:46.088
Ah! They care, after all!

04:46.180 --> 04:49.490
You should have a smoke alarm,
with that old piss-pot living here.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.491
No offence.

04:51.580 --> 04:52.808
None taken.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.618
< Want to come back
and fit one for us?

04:54.700 --> 04:57.453
Yeah - come and do that.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.489
Why not?

05:00.580 --> 05:01.695
Tomorrow?

05:04.140 --> 05:06.415
OK. Sean.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.649
Mandy.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.014
lan.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.692
All right?

05:17.260 --> 05:19.137
Jesus, I'm so obvious!

05:19.220 --> 05:20.175
Just a bit!

05:20.260 --> 05:21.215
Fit or what?

05:21.300 --> 05:23.177
He won't go for you, Mand.

05:23.260 --> 05:24.488
There's a vote of confidence!

05:24.580 --> 05:25.854
No, he bats for us.

05:25.940 --> 05:28.454
Piss off! Him? No way.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.576
Tenner says I give him one
before you do.

05:30.660 --> 05:33.891
You think everyone's gay.
Can't you be different on your own?

05:33.980 --> 05:35.333
Money, and mouth!

05:35.420 --> 05:39.459
Bollocks! Tenner.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.293
You'd better not win!
I'm gagging for it.

05:49.660 --> 05:53.096
One here, one upstairs.

05:53.180 --> 05:56.616
All lethal, flammable
boozehounds covered!

05:56.700 --> 05:58.213
I've got cake.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.736
Ta. Er... I've got a shift.

06:03.980 --> 06:06.096
Listen... Fancy a drink?

06:09.020 --> 06:11.090
Shit!

06:12.940 --> 06:14.578
Bastard!

06:14.660 --> 06:15.854
He's at work.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.408
The Jockey.

06:26.660 --> 06:30.733
Number of kids you've had, you could
pop 'em without touching the sides.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.617
I mean, why bother?

06:32.700 --> 06:36.010
Because this little baba
is going to be done proper,

06:36.100 --> 06:38.091
and I want his daddy there!

06:38.180 --> 06:42.617
He'll only nick all the drugs
or start a ruck or summat!

06:42.700 --> 06:47.455
I could be your birthing partner. Ask me!

06:47.540 --> 06:48.973
No. Frank is doing it,

06:49.060 --> 06:52.575
and he's coming to antenatal
to learn how to do it right.

06:57.380 --> 06:59.689
Oh, my God! Stacy-Ann?

06:59.740 --> 07:02.334
THE Stacy-Ann?

07:02.420 --> 07:04.650
She's a cabbage!
You can do well better!

07:04.740 --> 07:06.332
She's all right when
you get to know her.

07:06.420 --> 07:09.457
I DO know her! Suet dumpling.

07:09.540 --> 07:11.371
Aidy Simpson said
I should give her a go.

07:11.460 --> 07:12.449
That dick? >

07:12.540 --> 07:18.376
Trust me, man, she's well worth it.
Best ever! Ever! Hidden depths.

07:18.460 --> 07:21.133
He gets anyone he wants
and she's his best ever.

07:21.220 --> 07:23.051
As long as she doesn't get smitten.

07:23.140 --> 07:24.289
Smitten?

07:24.380 --> 07:29.454
When she says "smitten", you
gotta bail. Got me? Smitten - bail.

07:29.540 --> 07:33.328
That is a pathetic reason to go out
with someone. "My mate told me to!"

07:33.420 --> 07:34.773
Why do you care?

07:34.860 --> 07:38.170
(Frank) Trapped in a circle on the...

07:38.260 --> 07:38.817
That's Dad!

07:38.900 --> 07:40.413
What are you doing here?

07:40.500 --> 07:44.891
Oh - abandoned,
tossed out - NHS rubbish!

07:44.980 --> 07:48.211
No sharps, medical waste...

07:48.300 --> 07:51.497
Bevan'd be turning in his grave!
Fucking bollocks!

07:51.580 --> 07:55.539
Same old, same old -
trapping in a fucking circle!

07:55.620 --> 07:56.575
Mum's looking for you.

07:56.660 --> 07:59.049
A circle of shite.

08:04.540 --> 08:05.734
Tits first.

08:05.820 --> 08:06.809
LAUGHTER

08:06.900 --> 08:07.935
Mum and Dad!

08:10.420 --> 08:13.890
What's this? Shagging our lass?
In me own gaff?

08:13.980 --> 08:16.858
I bet he's got the working equipment!
Unlike some!

08:16.940 --> 08:20.535
Piss off! Last time I saw to you,
you couldn't walk for a week!

08:20.620 --> 08:21.575
That were a shock!

08:21.660 --> 08:25.096
All right, mate? It's Carl, isn't it?
Don't mind me and the missus, mate.

08:25.180 --> 08:28.331
If she could give a decent hum job,
she'd be a diamond.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.092
Stay for a bit of tea, Carl?

08:30.180 --> 08:31.010
You don't have to.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.250
Shut up, you!
We like to get to know your friends.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.534
What do you say, Carly?
Pork chops and minty tats?

08:35.620 --> 08:36.655
Ta.

08:36.740 --> 08:38.457
You can call me Teresa, love.

08:38.539 --> 08:40.929
The pig's Dave.

08:41.020 --> 08:44.456
Look at the arse on that, eh?
Not bad for an old bird.

08:48.660 --> 08:52.653
Bag of pear drops and a penny chew,
please, Mister.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.097
I need a piss.

08:58.180 --> 09:03.095
Beer pourer - barman. Toucher
of old men's cocks - rent boy.

09:03.180 --> 09:04.693
Do you see the difference?

09:04.780 --> 09:06.338
Seems to know a lot about it.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.810
While we're on old people,
shouldn't we ban that?

09:09.900 --> 09:15.020
That's her new fella!
Jeff works in finance.

09:17.540 --> 09:21.169
Hiya, Fireman Sam! Didn't recognise
you with your kecks on!

09:21.260 --> 09:23.979
Well, same problem for me,
gas victim!

09:24.060 --> 09:26.415
So... coincidence?

09:26.500 --> 09:29.572
No, I've just been fitting your
smoke alarm and Mandy said, erm...

09:29.660 --> 09:31.696
I had a bet on with her.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.736
Let me guess...

09:35.860 --> 09:37.373
Buy us a pint with your winnings!

09:37.460 --> 09:40.054
- I get off in ten minutes.
- Yeah?

09:41.540 --> 09:42.768
I've got a room.

09:42.860 --> 09:45.135
You a bit of a slag, lan?

09:45.220 --> 09:47.734
Too right!
You a bit of a prude, Sean?

09:47.820 --> 09:48.775
Only to slags.

09:48.860 --> 09:55.652
So... what? Six months courting,
meet the parents, find out my intentions?

09:55.740 --> 09:58.698
Summat like that! Get us a pint.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.579
Driving us, then?

10:01.660 --> 10:03.218
Where to?

10:03.300 --> 10:04.619
Trampolining. I said.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.179
Oh...

10:06.260 --> 10:10.173
Right. Do you want
dropping anywhere, Carl?

10:10.260 --> 10:11.295
Yeah, ta.

10:11.380 --> 10:14.133
There's a spare chop here.
No need to hurry away.

10:15.580 --> 10:20.051
Well, you can't have it!
Not with that great hanging gut!

10:20.140 --> 10:21.368
Right, see you later then.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:31.660 --> 10:33.537
Do you know?

10:33.620 --> 10:36.134
I believe I've miscounted.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.733
There isn't another chop.

10:37.820 --> 10:39.014
I'll see if I can catch them up...

10:41.020 --> 10:42.214
Have you had your portion, Carly?

10:44.180 --> 10:46.250
I'm not sure I have.

10:47.860 --> 10:49.976
Perhaps I should suck on your bone.

10:52.540 --> 10:53.495
If you want.

11:07.820 --> 11:09.412
End of my shift.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.616
I don't shag strangers.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.770
Why don't you try something new?

11:15.700 --> 11:18.168
All right. Why not?

11:18.260 --> 11:19.215
PAGER BEEPS

11:19.300 --> 11:20.528
Shit!

11:20.620 --> 11:21.575
What?

11:21.660 --> 11:23.139
Emergency pager.

11:23.220 --> 11:26.690
BEEPING CONTINUES

11:29.900 --> 11:33.290
It'll just be a kid with his head
stuck in some railings.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.651
Who-who-whoah! Easy, tiger!

12:12.500 --> 12:14.331
Oooh! Oooh!

12:14.420 --> 12:19.369
Oh, yes! Oooh! Oh, yes!

12:19.460 --> 12:21.530
Oh! Oh, yes!

12:21.620 --> 12:24.737
Listen, all you have to do is be there
and bring me some flowers

12:24.820 --> 12:27.129
or something!

12:27.220 --> 12:28.858
I know my limitations.

12:28.940 --> 12:30.976
All I am saying is just

12:31.060 --> 12:36.134
be there and hold my hand and say
"Welcome to the world, little baby!"

12:36.220 --> 12:39.735
I didn't want to say, and I know you
don't like me mentioning this, but...

12:41.580 --> 12:43.730
...it's them little twins.

12:43.820 --> 12:45.299
I was there at the birth and it was

12:45.380 --> 12:49.214
like the fucking Battle of the Somme.
I couldn't go through that again.

12:49.300 --> 12:53.657
Right. So you did it for her,
but you won't do it for me!

12:53.740 --> 12:57.653
Look, it's not... Ah!

12:57.740 --> 13:00.618
It's not just the...

13:00.700 --> 13:01.849
horror.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.817
It's the memories.

13:03.900 --> 13:07.256
It's all I've got left of Gordon and Delia.

13:07.340 --> 13:09.649
You can give me that, can't you?

13:09.740 --> 13:13.255
It tears my heart out
every time I think of them.

13:13.340 --> 13:15.695
You, more than anyone, you know

13:15.780 --> 13:19.216
what it's like
not to be with your kiddies.

13:19.300 --> 13:21.177
Nigel and Delia.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.972
It's Nigel and Delia, not Gordon!

13:25.060 --> 13:28.177
Piss off! How many of you are there?

13:28.260 --> 13:31.809
I'm bound to get the odd name wrong,
aren't I? What am I, a census?!

13:31.900 --> 13:34.460
You are coming!

13:35.540 --> 13:36.575
Look, I just...

13:40.220 --> 13:41.653
Fuckin' little...

13:41.740 --> 13:44.254
thingy in the nest, you are!
Fuck you!

13:44.340 --> 13:47.138
If I'd fathered you,
I'd tear me own balls off!

13:47.220 --> 13:49.575
If you'd fathered me, I'd help!

13:53.300 --> 13:55.336
You should have got
a chair years ago.

13:55.380 --> 13:59.214
Suits you never having
to get off your arse.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.417
Abused, slashed...
Why do I come in here?

14:02.500 --> 14:05.492
Because we serve beer
and we haven't barred you this week.

14:07.340 --> 14:10.059
You've been getting some, haven't you?

14:10.140 --> 14:11.209
Why d'you say that?

14:11.300 --> 14:13.177
I can tell.

14:13.260 --> 14:15.774
You're all smug-Iooking and shit.

14:15.860 --> 14:18.499
Cheers, Mickey.
Glad you're so pleased for us.

14:18.580 --> 14:19.979
It's true, then?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.175
Maybe.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.773
Oh, sorry, mate.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.215
Out my fuckin' space, man!

14:25.300 --> 14:27.655
Touching me! What are you,
some kind of fuckin' queer boy?

14:27.740 --> 14:30.254
- Shane!
- I'm sorry I accidentally touched you.

14:30.340 --> 14:33.935
- It's all right.
- Don't do that.

14:34.020 --> 14:36.136
What you gonna fucking do about?

14:36.220 --> 14:37.699
- Christ!
- Eh! That's our kid!

14:37.780 --> 14:39.532
It's all right! It's all right!

14:39.620 --> 14:41.576
I know him! I know him!
There's no need, yeah?

14:41.660 --> 14:44.254
There's no need, eh?
It's only Shane.

14:44.340 --> 14:45.773
You know what he's like!

14:48.100 --> 14:49.215
Come on.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.612
He well deserved that!
He's a prick and a half!

15:01.700 --> 15:03.372
- I was a prick, too.
- It was hot!

15:03.460 --> 15:06.532
I wasn't expecting you to...

15:09.540 --> 15:11.337
Look, we've done it your way -
let's try mine.

15:11.420 --> 15:14.492
How about I take you
away from all this?

15:15.660 --> 15:16.854
What? Take me where?

15:16.940 --> 15:19.500
Well, there's only one way
to find out, isn't there?

15:24.820 --> 15:26.253
Are you coming?

15:32.220 --> 15:36.372
Is that where you chuck a ribbon
in the air and dance about on a mat?

15:36.460 --> 15:39.293
Or a ball.

15:39.380 --> 15:40.699
What?

15:40.780 --> 15:42.577
Chuck a ball in the air, too.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.249
When?

15:45.340 --> 15:48.696
Rhythmic gymnastics.
You were asking!

15:48.780 --> 15:50.771
Oh, yeah. Great.

15:53.660 --> 15:56.049
Ah! The lovebirds!

15:56.140 --> 15:59.098
Cooing and billing - nice!

15:59.180 --> 16:01.535
You off for physical jerks, madam?

16:01.620 --> 16:03.770
The exercise she does and she
still thinks she's got a hymen!

16:03.860 --> 16:05.418
Mum!

16:05.500 --> 16:06.535
Getting me kit.

16:06.620 --> 16:08.770
What a waste,
when she's got this one!

16:08.860 --> 16:11.294
D'you remember when you were
a bit of a specimen, Dave?

16:11.380 --> 16:13.098
This morning, weren't it?

16:13.180 --> 16:15.091
You wish.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.531
Drop you anywhere, Carl?

16:18.620 --> 16:19.814
I'm fine, thanks.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.333
Dad.

16:28.300 --> 16:32.088
Don't know anything, does he?

16:32.180 --> 16:33.738
Course he doesn't.

16:33.820 --> 16:35.014
He wouldn't care anyway.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.374
You sure?

16:36.460 --> 16:37.415
Of course I am.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.449
Trousers off!

16:53.140 --> 16:56.132
No... Argh!
No, it's not for me, that one!

16:58.340 --> 17:00.615
Yes!

17:04.940 --> 17:07.897
This is Jeff - works in finance.

17:07.980 --> 17:08.730
That right?

17:08.819 --> 17:10.571
Don't expect to get
anyone at my age,

17:10.660 --> 17:13.458
never mind someone wi' a proper job!

17:13.540 --> 17:15.019
So how did you meet?

17:15.099 --> 17:16.294
Slow dating.

17:17.940 --> 17:18.895
What's that?

17:18.980 --> 17:20.571
Speed dating for pensioners.

17:20.660 --> 17:22.218
Do you watch Corrie?

17:23.819 --> 17:25.252
Do you watch Corrie?

17:27.099 --> 17:28.772
Do you watch Corrie?

17:30.420 --> 17:31.330
I sometimes watch Emmerdale!

17:31.420 --> 17:34.776
Fuck it - that'll have to do!

17:34.860 --> 17:37.294
We've been inseparable ever since.

17:37.380 --> 17:40.770
So what exactly do you do
in finance, Jeff?

17:43.100 --> 17:44.055
Security.

17:44.140 --> 17:47.212
Very responsible!

17:47.300 --> 17:49.495
Pushbike squad!

17:49.580 --> 17:51.491
Mountain bike patrol!

17:51.580 --> 17:53.969
It's not a demotion - they're
better for getting round the estates.

17:54.060 --> 17:55.732
How can we help?

17:55.820 --> 17:57.651
- Frank been in?
- It's a day of the week, isn't it?

17:57.740 --> 17:59.890
- We're gunning for him.
- He knows why, too!

17:59.980 --> 18:01.538
So where are your bikes?

18:01.620 --> 18:03.531
Outside.

18:03.620 --> 18:04.814
Outside here?

18:09.060 --> 18:10.937
Police are looking for you!

18:11.020 --> 18:12.772
What? Oh...

18:14.420 --> 18:17.537
This is what happens when
you live life on the margins!

18:17.620 --> 18:20.373
Society releases its pitbulls.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.815
Been robbing charity boxes again, have we?

18:22.900 --> 18:23.889
Fuck off!

18:29.140 --> 18:30.539
Where've you been?

18:30.620 --> 18:34.499
- Bridlington. Gay capital of Yorkshire!
- Yeah?

18:34.580 --> 18:37.140
Got taken away.
Hotel and everything!

18:37.220 --> 18:38.448
What's with the bag?

18:38.540 --> 18:40.815
Gonna be at The Jockey for a bit.

18:43.660 --> 18:45.457
What?

18:45.540 --> 18:48.816
You know gays are, like,
famous for casual sex and that?

18:48.900 --> 18:50.094
Go on, surprise me!

18:50.180 --> 18:52.899
Is that all there is? I mean,

18:52.980 --> 18:55.494
you go out with someone
and it's all right, but...

18:55.580 --> 18:59.539
you want to shag their friend
and you like them, but...

18:59.620 --> 19:02.612
I mean, is it all right to have
sex with someone that you don't

19:02.700 --> 19:04.497
even like if it's really good sex?

19:04.580 --> 19:07.652
And they can cook!
Or does that not matter?

19:07.740 --> 19:11.255
Listen, are you shagging our mum?

19:11.340 --> 19:14.138
How d'you guess?

19:23.340 --> 19:27.936
Hey, we're ticking a list -
sex, travel, food...

19:28.020 --> 19:29.248
Peanut butter's rank!

19:29.340 --> 19:31.649
Cheers. What's next?

19:31.740 --> 19:34.095
- Meeting mates?
- Meeting family?

19:34.180 --> 19:37.331
No chance!
I wouldn't inflict mine on anyone!

19:37.420 --> 19:39.012
Honestly!

19:39.100 --> 19:42.775
That's stiff for someone who
stayed in a hotel with someone.

19:42.860 --> 19:45.932
God, you really are young and naive,
aren't you?

19:46.020 --> 19:49.899
You think that was a hotel?
Barely even made it to guesthouse.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.778
Why'd you take me there?
Am I a cheap date?

19:52.860 --> 19:54.213
- No, it's gay friendly.
- How?

19:54.300 --> 19:56.291
The woman serving there had a tache.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.296
Oh... Peanut butter!

20:02.380 --> 20:03.495
Fuckin' hell!

20:03.580 --> 20:04.296
Nasty!

20:09.540 --> 20:12.737
Gallagher!

20:12.820 --> 20:14.697
Come here! Frank!

20:17.660 --> 20:20.379
Frank! Can you stop?

20:20.460 --> 20:23.418
Frank! Come here! Gallagher!

20:25.100 --> 20:27.330
You should be ashamed of yourself!

20:27.420 --> 20:31.129
Oh, spare me the fuckin' lecture!

20:31.220 --> 20:34.735
Hospital property, Francis!
You're lucky it was us that saw the CCTV!

20:34.820 --> 20:38.608
Anyone else, you'd be on a charge.

20:38.700 --> 20:42.010
They're not superficial, you know! They hurt!

20:45.980 --> 20:51.930
So... You stole a wheelchair to try
and get out of going to antenatal classes?

20:52.020 --> 20:53.214
Yes!

20:54.820 --> 20:56.094
Tosser!

21:00.900 --> 21:04.176
<i>I don't care if Monday's blue</i>

21:04.260 --> 21:07.377
<i>Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too...</i>

21:07.460 --> 21:08.495
You remember Sean, don't you?

21:08.580 --> 21:11.174
The Shane nutter!
Yeah, we've met.

21:11.260 --> 21:12.170
I'm really sorry about that.

21:12.260 --> 21:14.694
Well, Sean's probably
gonna be around for a bit,

21:14.780 --> 21:17.453
if he plays his cards right.

21:17.540 --> 21:19.212
Howdy doody(!)

21:21.300 --> 21:23.336
Yeah. You off out?

21:23.420 --> 21:24.409
Yeah.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.456
Hey, you couldn't give
us a hand, could ya?

21:26.540 --> 21:29.008
Yeah.

21:29.100 --> 21:31.694
Can't we even have a family drink
without you going off on one?

21:31.780 --> 21:34.499
It's not my fault you
can't get it up any more.

21:34.580 --> 21:37.048
I didn't hear you complaining
this morning!

21:38.740 --> 21:43.814
Yeah? What d'you want? I can't talk now.
I'll be there.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.253
Look, I've got to go.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.568
What's up?

21:46.660 --> 21:49.493
Nothing. Just...

21:49.580 --> 21:52.413
a crisis at work. I'll see ya.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.411
I'm sorry.

21:58.340 --> 21:59.819
What's all that about?

21:59.900 --> 22:01.299
Dunno.

22:01.380 --> 22:05.373
You don't think it was
"if he plays his cards right", do you?

22:07.100 --> 22:08.692
I'm such a dick!

22:18.780 --> 22:20.930
Teresa, we can't!

22:22.940 --> 22:25.295
Scared of showing your cock, Carl?

22:26.380 --> 22:27.574
Er, no!

22:27.660 --> 22:30.572
Bit of a bad... pint.

22:30.660 --> 22:32.616
You were drinking Coke!

22:32.700 --> 22:34.895
I'm having a shit, Dave!

22:46.660 --> 22:50.255
Jeez, Teresa -
it's too close for me!

22:50.340 --> 22:52.979
I can't help meself, love. I'm smitten!

22:53.060 --> 22:55.654
Smitten? Bail!

22:55.740 --> 22:58.254
You've really touched me.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.376
And I don't just mean the sex.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.578
I hate hurting Dave.

23:05.660 --> 23:08.049
I hate it.

23:08.140 --> 23:11.018
But what can I do?

23:11.100 --> 23:13.773
D'you feel the same way, Carl?

23:13.860 --> 23:15.532
Say you do!

23:15.620 --> 23:18.498
Yeah. Course I do!

23:18.580 --> 23:21.219
This is big time now.

23:21.300 --> 23:24.451
But if you want to stop,
you say the word.

23:24.540 --> 23:27.373
Can I rely on you?

23:27.460 --> 23:28.973
Yeah, course you can.

23:33.180 --> 23:35.774
ZIP OPENS

23:37.820 --> 23:41.654
lan! Hey, wait up!

23:44.100 --> 23:45.931
Weren't sure I'd see you again.

23:46.020 --> 23:47.851
Why?

23:47.940 --> 23:49.214
Your excuse.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.211
Your work crisis.
There wasn't one, was there?

23:51.300 --> 23:57.455
Hey, hey, it was a crisis.
Just not work.

23:58.620 --> 23:59.894
It was my brother.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.097
It was just too boring
to tell you the truth.

24:03.180 --> 24:06.855
I thought I messed up coming across
all Mr Cocky Bollocks

24:06.940 --> 24:08.931
in front of Jamie and Karen.

24:09.020 --> 24:11.056
Course you didn't.

24:11.140 --> 24:15.053
If you say something
that pisses me off, I'll tell you.

24:15.140 --> 24:16.778
I promise.

24:16.860 --> 24:19.328
You do the same for me.

24:23.340 --> 24:26.537
Where you off?

24:26.620 --> 24:28.133
I was going home.

24:28.220 --> 24:29.414
Do you fancy a visitor?

24:29.500 --> 24:30.933
Everyone's in.

24:32.060 --> 24:33.095
And?

24:33.180 --> 24:34.818
You really want to meet the fuckers?

24:34.900 --> 24:36.811
Yeah!

24:39.580 --> 24:41.889
- Right, come on.
- Right, then!

24:47.620 --> 24:49.850
Hiya, love. Give us a kiss.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.851
I can't, we're on a wages run.

24:51.940 --> 24:56.092
You can stop long enough to give
your girlfriend a kiss.

24:56.180 --> 24:59.695
Oh, two seconds, Bradley. Come here!

25:02.860 --> 25:03.895
What?!

25:03.980 --> 25:04.890
Did you do this?

25:04.980 --> 25:05.776
No, I didn't!

25:05.860 --> 25:07.452
You're an inside woman.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.132
It's a set up!

25:09.220 --> 25:12.292
I didn't, Trev. Don't hate me!

25:18.620 --> 25:22.090
I was going to the chemist.
Condom run for the girls.

25:22.180 --> 25:23.215
Don't tell us that!

25:23.300 --> 25:23.857
It's the truth!

25:23.940 --> 25:25.896
Let's not complicate the armed robbery

25:25.980 --> 25:28.938
with living off immoral earnings.
You'll get 15 years.

25:29.020 --> 25:29.418
In prison?!

25:29.500 --> 25:31.730
No-one thinks Lillian was involved.

25:31.820 --> 25:34.493
Judas! Judas!

25:34.580 --> 25:36.332
Does that mean we're finished?

25:36.420 --> 25:38.650
Judas!

25:38.740 --> 25:42.096
I think he really meant it. I've been dumped.

25:48.940 --> 25:52.012
So, you don't care that I'm scared?

25:52.100 --> 25:55.888
And what about me? There's no point
in us both cracking it, is there?

26:00.460 --> 26:03.975
Come on, we're fucking useless.
We both know it.

26:10.420 --> 26:13.412
I know. I'll do you a swap.

26:13.500 --> 26:16.219
You come to the birth,

26:16.300 --> 26:20.896
and I will get the doctor to put
in an extra stitch downstairs.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.777
Honeymoon fresh.

26:26.740 --> 26:28.571
Make it two,
and you got yourself a deal.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.531
Tinker.

26:32.620 --> 26:36.215
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

26:38.700 --> 26:40.133
< Monica Gallagher.

26:40.220 --> 26:41.414
Oi!

26:41.500 --> 26:44.378
Just realised what you look
like with those bandages on.

26:44.460 --> 26:47.611
Oh, surprise and delight me
with your acute observation!

26:47.700 --> 26:48.655
The Mummy!

26:48.740 --> 26:51.413
LAUGHTER

26:51.500 --> 26:53.968
Everyone's a comedian!

27:01.380 --> 27:03.416
Gary Bennett's died.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.694
What, the impressionist?

27:04.780 --> 27:06.930
No, lan's real dad.

27:08.020 --> 27:09.453
Oh.

27:09.540 --> 27:10.973
Good.

27:18.580 --> 27:19.535
This is Sean.

27:22.660 --> 27:23.615
Hello.

27:23.700 --> 27:24.735
All right?

27:24.820 --> 27:27.288
It's official then? You two an item?

27:27.380 --> 27:30.417
Yeah, laugh once, then get over it.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.979
Bastards.

27:32.060 --> 27:34.733
Sean, I've got some photos of lan from when
he was a baby, do you wanna see?

27:34.820 --> 27:37.414
If you said you were bringing a new
friend round, I would have hoovered!

27:37.500 --> 27:38.330
Yeah, all right!

27:38.420 --> 27:40.297
KNOCK AT DOOR

27:40.380 --> 27:41.938
Do you wanna sit down, Sean?

27:42.020 --> 27:43.612
Ta.

27:43.700 --> 27:48.251
Are you Liam? I hear you've got
a healthy interest in fire.

27:48.340 --> 27:49.295
I've grown out of that.

27:49.380 --> 27:53.851
Oh. All right. You won't want
a ride in the engine, then?

27:53.940 --> 27:57.091
No, I want that. I really want that!

27:57.700 --> 27:58.894
For you, Carl.

27:58.980 --> 27:59.776
Who is it?

27:59.860 --> 28:01.088
Quick, mind.

28:10.420 --> 28:12.456
I've left him, Carl!

28:12.540 --> 28:15.771
I've finally left him! For real, this time.

28:17.060 --> 28:19.858
And I've told him everything - everything!

28:29.900 --> 28:32.733
I'm free, Carl. I'm free!

28:32.820 --> 28:36.176
This is the real Teresa.
I just bombed out the house.

28:36.260 --> 28:37.295
What did Dave say?

28:37.380 --> 28:40.452
Terrible things. Oh, some threats.

28:40.540 --> 28:42.656
He's a horrible, cruel man. >

28:42.740 --> 28:46.858
I blame Strangeways. Brutalised him.

28:46.940 --> 28:48.259
Why was he there?

28:48.340 --> 28:52.413
GBH with menaces. Six years.

28:52.500 --> 28:56.129
Very harsh.
Fella's still got his other eye.

28:57.460 --> 29:01.976
Just hold me, Carl. Just hold me!

29:02.060 --> 29:06.099
When I say just hold me,
I didn't mean just hold me!

29:06.180 --> 29:08.410
Do me, Carl!

29:09.620 --> 29:11.258
What? What is it?

29:11.340 --> 29:13.854
I can't. Not here.

29:13.940 --> 29:18.172
Don't be scared. You've seen the belly on him.
You can outrun that porker until Christmas.

29:18.260 --> 29:20.649
- I'll get us a shag pad.
- Yeah.

29:20.740 --> 29:22.458
Then we can be together.

29:22.540 --> 29:24.576
What?

29:24.660 --> 29:27.379
You're not gonna let me down.
Are you?

29:29.780 --> 29:32.089
Just gonna get a cup of...

29:42.220 --> 29:43.573
Jesus!

29:43.660 --> 29:45.378
In case you wondered, you're dumped.

29:45.460 --> 29:45.812
Sorry.

29:45.900 --> 29:49.131
My dad's gonna tear your dick off
and shove it in your mouth.

29:49.220 --> 29:53.896
Thought you liked me.
Taking advantage of me like that. Scum!

29:58.260 --> 29:59.375
That's what you gotta do.

29:59.460 --> 30:00.495
What?

30:00.580 --> 30:01.899
Dump the geriatric weirdo.

30:01.980 --> 30:03.208
It's not that easy.

30:03.300 --> 30:07.737
Yeah, it is. Just tell her
she's a dirty old perv. Chuck her.

30:07.820 --> 30:08.696
How?

30:08.780 --> 30:10.008
Tell her now.

30:16.380 --> 30:17.893
Is it always like this?

30:17.980 --> 30:19.208
Pretty much.

30:19.300 --> 30:22.770
I'll kill myself! I'll throw
myself under a bin lorry!

30:22.860 --> 30:25.294
I'm not gonna lose ya, I won't!

30:25.380 --> 30:32.058
No, no, stop it! I wasn't gonna chuck ya,
I wasn't. Honest.

30:32.140 --> 30:37.419
I was gonna suggest someone
who might have a flat for us.

30:40.860 --> 30:43.499
Sweet, sweet boy.

30:48.060 --> 30:52.178
I'll stay at me sister's for now.
Walk me there.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.531
- See ya later.
- See ya later.

31:20.140 --> 31:22.779
Could you stop smiling?
You're making me puke.

31:22.860 --> 31:25.579
You must have a fit straight friend
I could do.

31:25.660 --> 31:27.616
I'm too busy shagging to meet friends.

31:27.700 --> 31:30.009
Shame. I remember that.

31:30.100 --> 31:32.091
It's like a distant memory.

31:32.180 --> 31:34.296
Think it's time I got back on the bike.

31:36.260 --> 31:37.739
You look good together.

31:37.820 --> 31:38.855
Piss off.

31:38.940 --> 31:43.013
I mean it! Not as good as
I'd look with him, but!

31:46.620 --> 31:50.090
Debbie, have you got anything black
that would fit me?

31:50.180 --> 31:52.740
Erm, no. Why don't you try Norma?

31:52.820 --> 31:55.971
Can hardly wear one of
her T-shirts to a funeral.

31:56.060 --> 31:57.334
Who's died?

31:57.420 --> 32:03.131
Oh, sorry, love... it's your dad.

32:04.140 --> 32:09.373
- Dad?!
- Oh, not that dad, lan's dad. Gary.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.530
Shit.

32:11.620 --> 32:14.896
You didn't know him, though, did you?

32:16.020 --> 32:17.214
Uh...

32:17.300 --> 32:19.814
I didn't actually know you knew who he was.

32:19.900 --> 32:23.688
It was a chat I've been
meaning to have together.

32:23.780 --> 32:25.452
I'm not going to get the chance
to know him now.

32:25.540 --> 32:26.689
Mmmm.

32:26.780 --> 32:29.578
Do you go to the funeral
of everyone you've slept with?

32:29.660 --> 32:34.939
Debbie, that would be absurd. No,
I gave him a clock and I want it back.

32:35.020 --> 32:38.251
It were me gran's.
I always liked it.

32:38.340 --> 32:41.332
Probably worth enough to put up with
the names from his wife.

32:41.420 --> 32:42.648
Do you want to come?

32:53.260 --> 32:56.809
See this?!
You want to take a wild guess?

32:56.900 --> 33:00.734
I'll see to you, Carl!
You're as good as dead!

33:00.820 --> 33:03.857
As good as fucking dead!

33:04.700 --> 33:10.855
There's your dead dad.
Not much of a turnout, is it?

33:10.940 --> 33:12.851
That's alcoholics for you.

33:14.940 --> 33:15.929
Biggish family, mind.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.214
Yeah.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.779
Nothing compared to us, though.

33:18.860 --> 33:22.489
Just four lads with that blonde bitch.
Panda eyes over there.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.414
Those four?

33:27.500 --> 33:30.617
Yeah. Well, you'd
have to be related to touch her.

33:34.340 --> 33:35.329
What is it?

33:35.420 --> 33:37.809
Can't stay.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.492
- What about me clock?
- Now!

33:39.580 --> 33:41.093
Oh, lan!

33:45.140 --> 33:46.539
What a fuckin' mess.

33:46.620 --> 33:47.575
Too right.

33:47.660 --> 33:49.013
What's up with you?

33:49.100 --> 33:51.330
KNOCKING

33:51.420 --> 33:52.933
It's her! Don't answer!

33:53.020 --> 33:54.931
KNOCKING

33:55.020 --> 33:55.930
Don't answer!

33:56.020 --> 33:56.975
< lan?

33:57.060 --> 33:59.210
< lan, it's Sean.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.653
(lan) Don't answer! >

34:00.740 --> 34:01.934
First row?

34:02.020 --> 34:03.851
< Sean, come on!

34:03.940 --> 34:06.010
KNOCKING

34:06.100 --> 34:07.897
- Should I get that one?
- No!

34:07.980 --> 34:10.540
Carl? Carl? It's me. >

34:10.620 --> 34:13.532
I've got to speak to you, love.
I've got to! >

34:13.620 --> 34:15.735
< lan, I need to talk to you.

34:15.820 --> 34:17.889
I'll see you later, love. >

34:17.980 --> 34:19.333
< Fuck's sake!

34:19.420 --> 34:21.536
I'm guessing you haven't slept
with your boyfriend's dad...

34:21.620 --> 34:23.212
Much worse than that, mate.

34:23.300 --> 34:26.929
You've been a twat and now you're
paying for it. Lesson learnt.

34:27.020 --> 34:29.090
Not many free fucks about, are there?

34:29.179 --> 34:30.295
Up yours!

34:34.219 --> 34:36.609
- Don't!
- He's gone.

34:38.420 --> 34:40.012
It'll work itself out.

34:40.100 --> 34:41.692
Bound to be a tiff when you're starting out.

34:48.340 --> 34:51.536
A tiff? That's what you fuckin' think, is it?

34:51.620 --> 34:54.214
Do you not think I'm a real fuckin'
person? Don't think it matters

34:54.300 --> 34:55.891
cos it's two blokes?

34:55.980 --> 34:58.096
Cos it's...

35:00.980 --> 35:02.413
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.933
Sorry?

35:08.500 --> 35:09.455
DOOR SLAMS

35:14.620 --> 35:15.575
All right?

35:16.660 --> 35:18.059
Yeah.

35:19.140 --> 35:21.370
Heard about your old fella.

35:24.460 --> 35:26.735
Yeah, well you're better off with me, son,

35:26.820 --> 35:29.334
cos from what I hear
he was an hopeless piss-pot.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.490
Yeah, and you're quite good at it.

35:31.580 --> 35:35.016
That I am, son. That I am.

35:37.860 --> 35:40.135
What's going on?

35:47.100 --> 35:50.456
Kids get to a certain age,
you'd rather not know what they're up to.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.974
I'll say.

35:53.060 --> 35:54.618
About two weeks old for me.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.650
Your dad... It was your dad who died - Gary?

36:05.740 --> 36:07.537
How did you know?

36:07.620 --> 36:11.169
Why didn't you stay?

36:11.260 --> 36:13.569
What?

36:15.180 --> 36:18.616
Old mate of my mum's.
I were keeping her company.

36:18.700 --> 36:21.260
I didn't know it were your...

36:21.340 --> 36:25.413
I saw you. I thought you'd
think I was some stalker weirdo.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.092
It was really nice to see you.

36:27.180 --> 36:29.171
It meant a lot.

36:29.260 --> 36:32.093
Why didn't you tell me
your dad had died?

36:32.180 --> 36:33.772
He's...

36:33.860 --> 36:36.977
Well, he'd... been ill for a while.

36:37.060 --> 36:40.689
I got the call here -
you know, the crisis?

36:40.780 --> 36:44.136
It wasn't my brother, it was him.

36:44.220 --> 36:48.259
I don't know, it just seemed a turn-off.
We'd only just met and...

36:48.340 --> 36:52.049
it was all going... I didn't even like him.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.539
He was a joke.

36:53.620 --> 36:55.690
A drunk.

36:55.780 --> 36:58.977
Cruel, absent loser.

37:02.100 --> 37:04.694
I don't know.
But your dad's your dad.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.011
Hey...

37:09.100 --> 37:12.058
Hey, I'm the one who should be upset.
You're looking after me.

37:12.140 --> 37:13.573
Yeah.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.093
Come here.

37:42.060 --> 37:45.132
All right, speak to the bloke.
Tell him to take her back.

37:45.220 --> 37:49.293
Very sorry, big mistake,
won't happen again. All that bollocks.

37:49.380 --> 37:51.336
He's gonna cut my balls off.

37:51.420 --> 37:53.058
Well meet him somewhere public.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.893
The Jockey.
What's he gonna do in there?

37:57.860 --> 37:59.293
Shit!

38:06.900 --> 38:10.256
He's not here. He works at Help the Aged.
You should try him there.

38:10.340 --> 38:12.092
Very funny.

38:12.180 --> 38:16.093
Some day you will know our love is real.
I will find him.

38:42.340 --> 38:43.773
Where's the fire?

38:45.540 --> 38:49.419
Thanks. Me dad and that.
It's important having someone...

38:52.140 --> 38:53.539
I haven't done anything.

38:53.620 --> 38:55.497
Having someone there for me.

38:55.580 --> 38:57.411
You're not just great sex, lan.

38:59.220 --> 39:00.573
I love you.

39:06.380 --> 39:07.779
I don't love you.

39:12.260 --> 39:13.534
That's all right.

39:13.620 --> 39:16.180
I'm emotional.

39:16.260 --> 39:17.454
Blabbermouth.

39:19.060 --> 39:21.893
I don't wanna carry on seeing you.

39:21.980 --> 39:23.971
What?

39:24.060 --> 39:25.493
What, you're chucking me?

39:27.300 --> 39:29.370
My dad's just died.

39:30.980 --> 39:32.652
I don't believe you.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.253
You're not that fuckin' cruel.

39:34.340 --> 39:38.253
We're getting on.
We're solid. I know we are.

39:38.340 --> 39:41.252
What is it? There's something else?

39:42.740 --> 39:43.695
No...

39:43.780 --> 39:45.850
Yes, there is.

39:45.940 --> 39:48.056
What is it, lan? Tell me.

39:48.140 --> 39:50.893
Look, we agreed... If I've pissed you off...

39:55.980 --> 39:58.210
My mum...

39:58.300 --> 40:00.291
Monica Gallagher.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.889
She wasn't an old mate of your dad's.

40:04.980 --> 40:10.532
She got pregnant by him. We're brothers.

40:12.660 --> 40:13.615
Fuck off.

40:18.260 --> 40:20.057
What about the waster, Frank?

40:20.140 --> 40:21.653
He's my dad.

40:23.260 --> 40:26.138
But my real dad was Gary.

40:46.700 --> 40:53.219
Look, I know that this
hasn't worked out and I'm sorry.

40:53.300 --> 40:55.131
Really.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.778
I didn't mean to...

40:56.860 --> 40:58.054
< Take the piss out of me?

40:58.140 --> 41:00.335
My family,

41:00.420 --> 41:02.297
my whole fuckin' existence.

41:02.380 --> 41:05.577
No, I didn't. I just think
we need to be straight with each other.

41:05.660 --> 41:08.220
I love that woman.

41:08.300 --> 41:11.610
I love the very bones of her. I can't...

41:11.700 --> 41:14.772
Life... Life's unimaginable without her.

41:16.420 --> 41:17.899
I can't see it.

41:17.980 --> 41:19.811
I just can't. I don't want her.

41:19.900 --> 41:23.449
I want you to take her back.
She's yours. Just have her.

41:25.220 --> 41:27.654
So you'll chuck her then,

41:27.740 --> 41:29.537
just like that?

41:29.620 --> 41:34.091
Like she was a piece of fuckin' rubbish.

41:36.340 --> 41:39.218
I can't get my head around it.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.733
We're brothers.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.456
I think I don't wanna stop seeing you.

41:46.540 --> 41:47.655
We're related.

41:47.740 --> 41:50.618
Yeah, but does it matter?
Does it have to be incest?

41:50.700 --> 41:53.897
That stuff's for straights,
to stop them having daft kids.

41:53.980 --> 41:55.049
We're not breeders.

41:55.140 --> 41:57.449
I think...

41:57.540 --> 42:02.250
I think we know it does.
I feel completely different.

42:02.340 --> 42:04.774
You do too.

42:04.860 --> 42:07.818
Nobody knows. We could carry on.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.050
We just had sex, for God's sake.

42:11.660 --> 42:14.458
It still works.

42:14.540 --> 42:16.132
No, it doesn't.

42:16.220 --> 42:17.414
We know.

42:19.380 --> 42:21.769
It's over.

42:27.740 --> 42:29.696
Do you want a drink or something?

42:31.300 --> 42:33.768
We didn't want it to turn out like this.

42:33.860 --> 42:37.375
So what's it going to be this time then?
Both eyes?

42:38.540 --> 42:39.734
Or do I get you back?

42:39.820 --> 42:41.412
It's too late.

42:41.500 --> 42:44.412
No, it's not. It's not too late.

42:44.500 --> 42:45.455
This?

42:47.660 --> 42:49.730
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

42:49.820 --> 42:51.538
I'm 16.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.338
I'm just randy.

42:57.980 --> 43:01.256
Take me back or you're gonna see brains.

43:01.340 --> 43:03.171
Dave, don't.

43:05.300 --> 43:07.097
< (Dave, put the gun down).

43:07.180 --> 43:10.058
- Bastard!
- Oh, for Christ's sake, don't!

43:10.140 --> 43:11.368
Leave it, Shane!

43:12.260 --> 43:13.534
Let's have you!

43:16.100 --> 43:17.249
Dave!

43:17.340 --> 43:19.808
What the fuck was that?
You just fuckin' shot us?

43:19.900 --> 43:24.052
Dave! It was loaded! Why did you load it?

43:24.140 --> 43:26.495
I meant it, Teresa.

43:29.300 --> 43:31.370
It was really loaded.

43:31.460 --> 43:34.611
That's how much he needed me.

43:34.700 --> 43:38.579
I'm sorry, Carl. But how could I leave a man
who would do that for his woman?

43:38.660 --> 43:40.298
So what was I?

43:40.380 --> 43:41.938
I'm sorry, love.

43:42.020 --> 43:44.295
It's better we finish now.

43:44.380 --> 43:46.211
Cos he needs me

43:46.300 --> 43:48.575
and I have to go back.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.093
Always.

43:53.780 --> 43:58.217
I'll never forget you
but we're locked together, me and him.

43:58.300 --> 43:59.733
It's for life.

44:01.100 --> 44:02.055
Sorry.

44:02.140 --> 44:05.098
You used me
to get your fuckin' kicks?

44:07.180 --> 44:08.852
When you get married,

44:08.940 --> 44:10.498
you'll understand.

44:10.580 --> 44:12.536
Fuck that. Youse two deserve each other.

44:12.620 --> 44:15.817
No wonder your daughter's
a fucked up nut job.

44:18.780 --> 44:21.089
(Lillian) 'Hilda Ogden never cried
when Stan died.

44:21.180 --> 44:24.092
'Not until she got home,
found a pair of his glasses

44:24.180 --> 44:26.489
'on the sideboard. Set her right off.

44:29.060 --> 44:31.290
'I understood that when I got widowed.

44:33.140 --> 44:37.611
'AII over the house,
little ghosts waiting to jump out.

44:37.700 --> 44:40.737
'They remind you of the things
you're not going to share.'

44:40.820 --> 44:42.492
Did he just try and shoot you?

44:42.580 --> 44:44.536
No.

44:44.620 --> 44:47.214
Showing off to his wife, apparently.

44:48.820 --> 44:51.015
So what's happened to you two?

44:51.100 --> 44:54.012
You split up already?

44:54.100 --> 44:55.010
Why?

44:55.100 --> 44:57.375
You don't wanna know.

44:57.460 --> 44:59.132
'When you're with someone,

44:59.220 --> 45:03.179
'there's a future, a present,
something to look forward to.

45:03.260 --> 45:05.535
'Then they've gone and there's nothing in front.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.417
'It's all back.

45:07.500 --> 45:12.051
'Memories, regrets... and it never stops.'

45:12.140 --> 45:15.018
We had the same dad.

45:15.100 --> 45:16.135
We're brothers.

45:16.220 --> 45:18.814
Half brothers.

45:18.900 --> 45:20.970
Are we half brothers?

45:21.060 --> 45:23.972
Don't worry, you're safe. Dick!

45:24.740 --> 45:26.173
You muppet!

46:10.300 --> 46:11.699
Oi, look out!
