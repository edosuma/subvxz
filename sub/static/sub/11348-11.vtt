In the criminal justice system,

00:09.743 --> 00:12.280
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.682
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.715 --> 00:16.617
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.650 --> 00:18.286
are members of an elite squad

00:18.319 --> 00:20.321
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

You're gonna be okay, sweetie.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.329
Do you remember
what happened to you?

02:42.330 --> 02:44.198
No.

They found me in an alley,
in a suitcase?

03:42.990 --> 03:45.459
I don't remember that.

03:45.493 --> 03:48.796
So, Madison, what's the last
thing that you do remember?

03:52.566 --> 03:54.302
Coming to the city
to see Wicked.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.003
I live in Ronkonkoma.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.538
And you came by yourself?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.507
I was supposed to meet
a girlfriend.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.508
(Benson)
Supposed to?

04:00.541 --> 04:02.843
So you didn't?

04:02.876 --> 04:05.779
Okay, did you end up
seeing the show?

04:05.813 --> 04:10.651
I was coming from my uncle's
in the Upper West Side.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.520
I took a cab.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.655
My mom doesn't like me
taking the subway.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.325
Well, we'll need your uncle's
information and your friend's.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.793
I don't want to get them
in trouble with my mom.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.028
So where is she?

04:21.061 --> 04:23.631
Atlantic City,

04:23.664 --> 04:24.898
with some girlfriends.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.004
Oh, god.

so mad at me.

(Nolan)
I respond.
I find her unconscious

04:41.081 --> 04:42.550
in a half opened
suitcase.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.618
The suitcase looks
tourist shop generic.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.619
You call CSU yet?

04:45.653 --> 04:46.620
Yeah, four times already.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.788
When they get here,

04:47.821 --> 04:49.357
have them run it for DNA
and prints.

04:49.390 --> 04:49.990
Maybe we'll get lucky.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.559
My guess, she's underage.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.060
She OD's while partying
at a club,

04:53.093 --> 04:53.994
and they dump her.

or heard anything.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.069

What's up, Liv?

05:09.076 --> 05:10.578
(Benson)
So the last thing
that Madison remembers

05:10.611 --> 05:12.112
is leaving
her uncle's apartment.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.781
And now he's not
picking up the phone.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.916
So find out why
he hasn't noticed

05:15.949 --> 05:17.050
that his niece is missing.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.586
Okay, we're headed
over there.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.757
Did you tell your uncle
that you were

05:23.791 --> 05:25.693
going to Times Square
by yourself?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.094
He got me the tickets.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.796
Okay, so you got
in the cab.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.797
Then what?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.565
He locked the doors.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.033
He was driving
like a lunatic.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.635
Well, can you tell us
anything about him,

05:34.668 --> 05:35.669
his age, ethnicity?

05:38.105 --> 05:40.374
Middle Eastern, maybe.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.042
I'm sorry.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.043
I was trying to
text my friend,

05:43.076 --> 05:45.479
'cause I was freaked out.

05:45.513 --> 05:49.617
Oh, my god,
my phone.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.918
Do you guys have it?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.486
(Benson)
Madison, when they found you,

05:52.520 --> 05:56.990
you had no purse,
you had no clothes.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.892
You don't remember
how that happened?

06:02.162 --> 06:05.433
The driver--
I remember now.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.167
He--

06:07.200 --> 06:09.169
He pulled over,

06:09.202 --> 06:12.139
and he climbed into the back,

06:12.172 --> 06:13.941
and he made me
take some pills,

06:13.974 --> 06:17.545
and after that,
I don't know.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.447
We're gonna need you
to do a rape kit?

06:19.480 --> 06:20.648
A rape kit?

06:20.681 --> 06:21.982
Why?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.684
Because somebody
assaulted you, sweetie.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.018
We need to
find out who?

06:25.052 --> 06:26.554
But I wouldn't recognize him.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.823
Okay, how about we take it
one step at a time?

We're here about
your niece Madison.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.072
Madison?

06:45.105 --> 06:47.040
She's up in the guest room,
asleep.

Can we come in,
Mr. Baker?

06:51.044 --> 06:53.013
[sighs]
Sure.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.050
Madison?

07:01.054 --> 07:02.590
Oh, a little wake and bake
there, chief?

07:02.623 --> 07:03.691
That's--that's not mine.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.692
That belongs
to a friend.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.726
Mm-hmm.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.094
She's--she's in here.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.729
She's sleeping.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.063
You check on her
last night?

07:10.097 --> 07:12.165

Wait.
What?

07:25.913 --> 07:27.080
I thought
she came home.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.683
When's the last time
you saw her?

07:29.717 --> 07:31.084
6:00.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.020
We were supposed to go see
a show.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.021
Wicked?

07:34.054 --> 07:35.022
But, um...

07:35.055 --> 07:36.156
But she said
she had a friend

07:36.189 --> 07:37.157
that was dying
to see it.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.158
A friend.
Who?

07:38.191 --> 07:39.760
[sighs]

07:39.793 --> 07:40.794
I don't know.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.197
These the tickets?

07:44.231 --> 07:45.633
Wait.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.467
She didn't go?

07:48.569 --> 07:49.537
Where is she?

07:49.570 --> 07:50.904
(Fin)
Mercy Hospital.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.807
What happened to her?
Is she okay?

07:53.841 --> 07:55.509
What, now you're worried
about your niece?

07:55.543 --> 07:56.544
Where were you last night?

07:56.577 --> 07:58.078
Uh...

07:58.111 --> 08:00.113
A meat market.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.982
I got home at about 1:00, okay?

08:02.015 --> 08:04.685
Her backpack was here,
the door was closed.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.855
Any way we can
verify that?

08:07.888 --> 08:09.122
[sighs]

08:17.898 --> 08:20.133
When he wakes up,
you can ask him.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.537
Look, guys, clearly
I screwed up, okay?

08:23.571 --> 08:25.038
Don't tell my sister.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.110
Okay, man.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.980
Madison's friend
you're talking about,

08:33.013 --> 08:34.715
is this her boyfriend?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.116
(Matt)
I have no idea.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.118
Look, it's not like she's chatty
with me or anything, okay?

08:38.151 --> 08:39.787
She's 15.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.154
She's on her cell phone
all the time,

08:41.188 --> 08:42.556
just texting.

08:43.757 --> 08:44.825
You know what?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.259
Go wake your friend up.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.795
We'll wait out here.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.631
So where were we?

08:50.664 --> 08:51.999
Madison lied
to her uncle.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.701
Didn't even take
the theater tickets.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.202
And that taxi driver story.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.738
I mean, speeding through
Times Square after 6:00?

08:57.771 --> 08:59.573
You'd make better time
on a goat.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.141
(Benson)
Well, something happened
to her.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.043
The tox screen shows alcohol,

09:03.076 --> 09:05.846
Ambien, and Xanax
in her system.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.181
Now, the rape kit
didn't turn up any DNA,

09:08.215 --> 09:10.017
but it did find
condom lubricant.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.685
So this is what,
a hookup gone bad?

09:11.719 --> 09:13.253
Bad enough to dump a body
in a suitcase?

09:13.286 --> 09:14.855
(Benson)
Carisi, check her
social media.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.856
Facebook, Instagram,

09:15.889 --> 09:16.857

all of it.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.858
On it.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.059
Cell records coming in.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.694
Madison was texting
constantly

09:20.728 --> 09:22.863
from the Upper West to
the Howell Hotel in Tribeca

09:22.896 --> 09:24.798
where her cell goes dead
at 2:00 A.M.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.099
Okay, we know
who she was texting?

09:26.133 --> 09:27.367
Yeah, I'll run the number.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.002
I'll save you
the trouble.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.303
She posted this on
her Instagram account

09:30.337 --> 09:31.304
yesterday afternoon.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.305
(Benson)
Who's that?

09:32.339 --> 09:33.306
(Carisi)
Scott Russo.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.307
(Fin)
Pretty boy actor?

09:34.341 --> 09:36.910
Yeah, actor/painter/philosopher.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.312
In his free time, he's trying
to end climate change.

09:39.346 --> 09:43.150
And he is in town this week
at the Edgefest Film Festival

09:43.183 --> 09:44.885
at the Howell Hotel
in Tribeca.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.187
I would love to take a run
at the renaissance man.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.056
Let's get Madison's side
of the story first.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.792
Mom just got
to the hospital.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.794
And let's keep her
out of the conversation.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.865
(woman)
My daughter's been assaulted.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.232
I'm staying with her.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.236
Madison?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.105
We saw you're Instagram account.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.108
The friend that you
told your uncle

10:08.141 --> 10:10.043
you were going to see

10:10.077 --> 10:12.179
was Scott Russo,
wasn't it?

10:12.212 --> 10:16.684
Scott Russo?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.218
My daughter's obsessed
with him.

10:18.251 --> 10:21.221
She's seen Caspian Sea
ten times.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.023
How did you even
get his number?

10:23.056 --> 10:24.892
We DM'd each other

10:24.925 --> 10:27.227
He lured you
to the city?

10:27.260 --> 10:29.229
How long has this
been going on?

10:29.262 --> 10:30.230
What did he do?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.031
Nothing, mom.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.200
He left you for dead
in a suitcase.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.868
(Madison)
Scott wouldn't hurt me.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.737
Okay.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.405
Tell us
what you remember.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.307
We know you went to
his hotel.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.212
Yeah.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.981
There was a party
at the bar.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.417
Scott texted that he could
get me on the guest list.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.185
And then what happened?

10:54.221 --> 10:55.789
Nothing.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.024
He got me a drink.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.091
Did you go
to his room?

10:59.092 --> 11:00.961
I don't know.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.163
They were giving out cocktails
at the party.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.298
I guess they were stronger
than I realized.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.935
I blacked out,
and next thing I remember

11:07.968 --> 11:09.703
is waking up in the hospital.

11:09.737 --> 11:13.206
Oh, Madison, my god.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.144
She is 15 years old.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.278
I don't care if he's
a movie star.

11:18.311 --> 11:19.913
Just arrest him.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.407
Namaste.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.842
Can I help you?

11:48.876 --> 11:50.944
You know a girl
named Madison Baker?

11:50.978 --> 11:52.245
Who?

11:52.279 --> 11:54.014
She's the 15-year-old girl

11:54.047 --> 11:56.183
that you were trading
selfies with yesterday.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.885
[speaks foreign language]

12:01.354 --> 12:02.355
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.394
She's a fan, right?

12:07.427 --> 12:09.396
She texted me,
and I responded.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.497
Is flirting a crime?

12:10.530 --> 12:12.065
You see her last night?

12:12.099 --> 12:15.869
Celebrity, fantasy,
and expectations,

12:15.903 --> 12:20.173
they're all part of my--
my art project.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.142
Did you see her last night
or not?

12:22.175 --> 12:23.877
I met her.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.779
You get her drinks,
or...

12:25.813 --> 12:28.181
Hey, they were giving
drinks away for free.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.883
All right,
that's not on me.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.919
(Fin)
So you did have a drink
with her.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.488
After Caspian Sea,
that's my fanbase, young girls.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.257
There's a bunch of 'em
in the lobby right now.

slip under the velvet rope.

Hey, look, man.

hang you here.

a bad choice.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.937
A guy, right?

12:49.970 --> 12:52.372
Not Scott Russo.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.506
Why?

12:53.540 --> 12:54.507
What is she saying?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.009
Well, tell us your side.

12:56.043 --> 12:57.110
What happened?

12:57.144 --> 12:58.111
You met her,
had a couple drinks,

12:58.145 --> 13:00.413
brought her up to the room,
something like that?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.216
No, we had some drinks,
and we talked.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.417
I left her in the booth.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.485
What time was that?

13:05.518 --> 13:08.388
I don't wear a watch, man.

He can vouch for me.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.103
Scott,
is everything all right?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.304
Yeah, we're cool.

This is Lydia,

Tell--tell 'em that you were
at the party last night.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.409
I was there.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.878
What's going on?

13:30.911 --> 13:32.212
We're just asking him
about a girl

13:32.245 --> 13:34.147
he took a selfie with
last night.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.415
He took a lot of selfies

13:35.448 --> 13:37.317
with waiters,
press, fans.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.551
He's a star,
after all.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.087
Yeah, well,
this fan was 15.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.621
And Scott was sexting
with her.

She had a rough night.

Lydia, I just talked to her.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.458
All right?
That's all.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.094
(Lydia)
Okay.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.496
Look, Scott has
a lot of cyberstalkers,

13:49.529 --> 13:51.164
and overwrought admirers,

13:51.198 --> 13:52.966
but whatever this is,

13:53.000 --> 13:54.234
he had nothing
to do with it.

13:54.267 --> 13:55.402
Then he won't mind answering

13:55.435 --> 13:57.070
a few more questions.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.305
Sure, sure.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.340
Just let me--
let me film it.

14:00.373 --> 14:01.641

email me your questions?

14:09.449 --> 14:10.884
Thanks, fellas.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.423
You like him for this?

14:16.456 --> 14:17.891
He might have
nailed that girl,

14:17.925 --> 14:19.259
but dumping her body
in a suitcase?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.929
I got self-absorbed idiot,
not psycho.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.596
Well, he said he left her
in the bar.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.433
Let's go to tape.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.205
So you want footage
from last night.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.942
We can get a warrant,
but usually hotels work with us.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.309
(man)
We already did.

14:36.343 --> 14:38.378
Do--do you guys even
talk to each other?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.680
A detective came in
late last night

14:40.713 --> 14:42.282
and pulled the footage.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.250
The hallway, the bar,

14:43.283 --> 14:44.584
the elevator, the lobby.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.954
I mean, he took
the whole hard drive.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.488
An NYPD detective?

14:48.521 --> 14:49.489
Yeah.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.690
What precinct?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.192
[laughs]

14:52.225 --> 14:53.393
Shouldn't you know that?

14:53.426 --> 14:55.495
You got footage
of this guy?

14:56.696 --> 14:58.198
I might be able to
get some footage

14:58.231 --> 14:59.266
of him walking out,

14:59.299 --> 15:00.533
but I'm gonna need
some IDs.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.405
(man)
Satellite feed starts in
two minutes, folks.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.240
Two minutes.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.341

Who's the red dress?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.310
(Carisi)
Seriously?
Their co-star Catalina Soren.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.344
Where have you been?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.482
I don't want you talking
to those detectives.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.950
I'm fine.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.520
How's my favorite client?

15:20.553 --> 15:22.489
Love you.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.159
(Lydia)
We're on in two.
Come on.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.995
I know Russo's a multitasker,

15:28.028 --> 15:29.429
but impersonating NYPD,

15:29.462 --> 15:31.631
stealing security footage,
dumping a body.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.600
It takes a village.

We love you!

15:45.645 --> 15:47.247

15:47.280 --> 15:49.116

15:53.720 --> 15:55.322

Instagram.

16:03.130 --> 16:03.330
.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.464
(Benson)
Whoever this guy is,
he told the hotel security

16:04.897 --> 16:06.433
that he was NYPD.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.301
He took all
the surveillance footage,

16:08.335 --> 16:09.702
the key card logs.

16:09.736 --> 16:10.703
Thorough.

16:10.737 --> 16:11.704
Thoughtful.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.373
Stupid.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.607
If you can't get 'em
for the crime,

16:14.641 --> 16:16.043
you can get 'em
for the cover-up.

16:16.076 --> 16:16.843
- Who's them?
- Fixers.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.445
This is Hollywood
on the Hudson.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.479
Russo's a star.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.048
He picks up an underage girl,

16:21.081 --> 16:22.049
she OD's in his bed,

16:22.082 --> 16:23.250
he makes some calls,

16:23.283 --> 16:24.451
goes away.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.120
Then why leave the last part
to chance?

16:27.154 --> 16:28.321
You mean kill her?

16:28.355 --> 16:30.290
You're watching
too many movies.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.225
You talked
to the girl twice,

16:32.259 --> 16:34.427
and she hasn't
accused him yet?

16:34.461 --> 16:36.129
Either she was paid off,
or she's obsessed.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.198
(Benson)
Look, she's 15 years old.

16:38.231 --> 16:39.432
She had drugs in her system.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.201
Maybe she really doesn't
remember her.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.269
Well, can you get us
a warrant

16:42.302 --> 16:44.071
for Russo's cell phone,
his room?

16:44.104 --> 16:45.272
I can get you phone records,

16:45.305 --> 16:47.107
but a warrant
for an actual phone

16:47.140 --> 16:49.342
after that Supreme Court
decision, not yet.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.344
Give me someone
who puts them together

16:51.378 --> 16:53.046
after the party--

16:53.080 --> 16:54.281
the hallway,
the elevator.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.050
Look, there were hundreds of
people at that party, the hotel.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.119
They couldn't have gotten
to them all.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.553
Go door-to-door.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.256
Russo did say
his co-star Skye

17:03.290 --> 17:04.391
saw him leave the party.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.259
So start there.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.497
(photographer)
That's great, Scott.
Give me some integrity.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.265
Oh, beautiful.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.266
Chin up a little.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.601
Fantastic.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.170
- Not very good.
- Camera loves you.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.372
(Carisi)
Hey, Skye, can we talk
to you for a minute?

17:19.406 --> 17:21.208
(Skye)
Whoa.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.076
We're in the middle
of a photo shoot.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.145
He may have witnessed
a rape.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.379
Oh, I didn't witness
any rape.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.380
(Lydia)
Skye.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.415
No, no, it's okay,
Lydia.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.449
Is this--

17:29.482 --> 17:31.151
this is about that girl,
right?

17:31.184 --> 17:34.154
Because, you know, if somebody
did something to her,

17:34.187 --> 17:35.455
maybe--maybe
I can help.

17:35.488 --> 17:36.623
Thank you.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.558
You see her at the party
with Russo?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.293
Yeah, in a booth.

17:40.327 --> 17:41.861
She seem okay to you?

17:41.894 --> 17:46.299
She seemed a little young
to be at a party like that.

17:46.333 --> 17:47.134
She was drinking.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.435
But that's not Scott.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.403
I mean, Edgefest is sponsored
by Aquavit.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.105
Well, here's the thing,
Skye.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.573
Russo told us that you
could vouch for him,

17:53.606 --> 17:55.142
that he left
before the girl did.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.209
Because he did.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.277
Right, Skye?

17:57.310 --> 17:59.179
No, no, not exactly.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.180
Lydia, I just played
a lawyer.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.215
I can't lie
to the police.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.619
He was there with her,

18:06.653 --> 18:08.288
and then I was talking
to a producer,

18:08.321 --> 18:10.523
and I turned around to see
if he would come over,

18:10.557 --> 18:11.524
and he was gone.

18:11.558 --> 18:12.625
What time was this?

18:12.659 --> 18:13.826
Around midnight.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.362
Did you see the girl leave?

18:15.395 --> 18:16.829
No, no.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.265
She was gone too.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.868
Thanks.

18:23.170 --> 18:23.970
(Amaro)
Hey.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.640
(Benson)
Who's arresting
Scott Russo?

18:27.674 --> 18:29.142
No, it's a preview
for his next movie.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.810
It's called Falsely Accused.

18:30.843 --> 18:34.181
[dramatic music]

18:34.214 --> 18:35.682
(male announcer)
Innocence betrayed.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.250
Justice denied.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.322
- A man alone...
- [screams]

18:42.355 --> 18:44.324
This is an egregious miscarriage
of justice, your honor!

18:44.357 --> 18:46.526
(announcer)
Against the system
that's betrayed him.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.935
Coming soon.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.271
He's charged with a rape/murder
he didn't commit,

18:58.305 --> 19:00.407
and Skye Adderson plays
the legal aid attorney

19:00.440 --> 19:01.408
who saves him.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.276
And?

19:03.310 --> 19:05.445
And they're both in the city
promoting this movie.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.447
Russo's accused of
assaulting a fan.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.249
That'll get you trending.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.683
She overdosed.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.785
Yeah, but now she can't
remember anything.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.254
They could all be
playing us.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.956
This fits Russo's whole
meta-meme thing to a T.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.227
Guys, I don't care if they're
doing it for publicity.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.829
Somebody had sex
with a 15-year-old girl

19:22.862 --> 19:26.266
and left her for dead
in an alley in a suitcase.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.834
That's a crime.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.202
Are we anywhere on that?

19:29.236 --> 19:30.437
Yeah, we talked to
two waiters.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.738
They said they saw Russo

19:31.771 --> 19:34.607
doing body shots
off of Madison.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.243
Okay.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.445
Can anybody put them in
the hallway, in the elevator?

19:38.478 --> 19:40.347
Did anybody
see them leave together?

19:40.380 --> 19:42.682
Skye may or may not have.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.251
Tried to thread
the needle on that.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.084
[cell phone buzzes]

19:45.117 --> 19:46.753
(Benson)
Check Snaptrends, Gramfeed.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.422
Put a plate on that entire
hotel block from 10:00 P.M.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.690
to 4:00 A.M.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.325
There were hundreds
of people there.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.926
Somebody must have posted
a selfie,

19:53.960 --> 19:55.262
a video, something.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.729
Hold up.
Google alert.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.764
Somebody did.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.799
Turn on LMZ.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.436
[man laughing on TV]

20:03.470 --> 20:06.539
(man)
Hey, you all know about
suitcase girl.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.375
(man)
The underage partier
who ended up

20:08.408 --> 20:10.610
naked in a suitcase
in a Tribeca alley?

20:10.643 --> 20:12.279
Yeah, well, even though
Scott Russo denied

20:12.312 --> 20:13.546
ever hooking up
with her.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.882
Surveillance footage shows
them in a lip lock

20:15.915 --> 20:17.517
at the Howell Hotel.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.320
[all groan]

20:20.353 --> 20:21.921
(man)
And when it came time
to call it a night,

20:21.954 --> 20:24.957
they pulled the old
"I'll leave first" play.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.964
(man)
Yeah, yeah.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.400
[voices overlapping]

20:33.433 --> 20:35.302
(man)
Scott, come on, man.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.970
Don't mess with
underage girls.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.540
And don't mess with LMZ.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.876
Now we know who impersonated
NYPD to get that footage.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.812
I'll call Barba.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.451
(man)
And don't mess with LMZ.

20:51.484 --> 20:55.655
(man)
Bad boy Scott Russo caught in
a sexting scandal.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.989
(man)
Catalina, is he guilty?

20:57.023 --> 20:58.291
(Catalina)
I just can't believe

20:58.325 --> 21:00.493
Scott would do something
like this.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.261
But if he did,
there's no defense.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.570
(Carisi)
Scott Russo.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.007
Show's over, Scott.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.047
Show's over, Scott.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.450
Show's over, Scott.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.985
Show's over, Scott.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.887
Show's over, Scott.

21:35.495 --> 21:35.695
.

21:35.728 --> 21:35.862
Hey.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.498
You want to
tweet the press,

21:38.531 --> 21:39.632
you want to
blow up Twitter,

21:39.666 --> 21:40.633
knock yourself out.

21:40.667 --> 21:41.801
But you're looking at
15 to 20

21:41.834 --> 21:43.336
for rape and assault.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.971
What, for a crime
I didn't commit?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.939
I just made this movie.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.341
It ends with me getting
a public apology

21:48.375 --> 21:49.576
from the NYPD.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.579
(Amaro)
Well, this isn't a movie,
Scott.

21:52.612 --> 21:53.980
While you were
at the gallery,

21:54.013 --> 21:56.416
we executed a search warrant
on your hotel room.

21:56.449 --> 21:57.517
I know.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.051
Lydia called me,
freaking out.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.620
"Let 'em search,"
I said.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.954
Girl was never
in there.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.623
CSU's still going over
your carpet,

22:03.656 --> 22:05.625
your drain,
your bedspread,

22:05.658 --> 22:07.694
but they already found Ambien
and Xanax in your bathroom,

22:07.727 --> 22:09.596
which match the drugs
in Madison's system.

22:09.629 --> 22:12.098
Oh, and condoms that match
the one used by the rapist.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.901
(Scott)
Yeah, those condoms are in
the hotel amenity basket.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.437
You said you left the girl
at the party.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.771
You lied.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.873
There's video of her
coming up to your room.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.942
You're opening the door.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.644
All right, look,
I invited her to the party.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.812
We had some drinks.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.147
I find out
she was underage,

22:28.180 --> 22:29.749
so I excused myself.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.551
She followed me
to my room, right?

22:31.584 --> 22:33.753
If you'd watched the rest of
the playback on that video,

22:33.786 --> 22:35.955
you would've seen that I
shut the door on her.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.658
Yeah, well, we don't have
the rest of that video,

22:38.691 --> 22:40.059
and we may never be able
to get it.

22:40.092 --> 22:43.563
(Amaro)
You know, you tell
that story on the stand,

22:43.596 --> 22:45.398
I don't care how good an actor
you think you are,

22:45.432 --> 22:47.567
there's not a jury in the world
that buys it.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.536
A jury?

22:49.569 --> 22:50.770
Hello?

22:50.803 --> 22:52.138
Somebody had sex

22:52.171 --> 22:54.607
with a drunk and drugged
15-year-old girl,

22:54.641 --> 22:56.142
wheeled the body
into an alley.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.647
You're in a lot of trouble
here, man.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.982
Wow.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.717
You guys actually think
that I did this.

23:11.991 --> 23:15.695
Okay, okay.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.565
This has to stay
on the DL, okay?

23:18.598 --> 23:19.566
She's married.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.968
Who's married?

23:22.001 --> 23:24.571
Catalina Soren.

23:24.604 --> 23:25.972
Your co-star?

23:26.005 --> 23:27.707
Yeah, I did the right thing
here, all right?

23:27.740 --> 23:29.776
I turned the
15-year-old down.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.178
But Catalina's room
is adjoining mine.

23:32.211 --> 23:35.014
And she was in my suite
all night long.

23:35.047 --> 23:37.617
Okay, well, we're gonna
need to talk to Catalina.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.118
I know,
but here's the thing.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.720
She's on a 19-hour flight
to New Zealand

23:40.753 --> 23:42.589
to shoot two cycles of
the Catalyst trilogy,

23:42.622 --> 23:43.590
and the thing is...

23:43.623 --> 23:44.857
Ugh.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.726
Her husband's
directing it.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.961
(Fin)
Mr. Russo's manager.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.563
Not another word, Scott.

23:50.597 --> 23:51.798
He's done talking

23:51.831 --> 23:53.733
until we get
our lawyer in here.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.067
Everything's gonna be okay.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.636
You're safe, baby.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.238
And he invokes.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.573
Okay, so we'll try to find
the actress.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.509
Do we have enough
to charge?

24:02.542 --> 24:03.743
Charge, sure.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.745
Make the case, no.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.947
The drugs and the condoms
are circumstantial.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.015
What does the girl say?

24:09.048 --> 24:10.550
Last time we spoke
to Madison,

24:10.583 --> 24:14.186
she said she didn't recall
going to his hotel room.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.455
Talk to her again.

24:18.257 --> 24:19.892
We all know what
Scott Russo did.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.661
Why isn't he rotting
in a jail cell?

24:21.694 --> 24:23.563
We want to make sure
our case is airtight

24:23.596 --> 24:24.664
before we bring him in.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.733
So he's free to go
where he wants,

24:26.766 --> 24:27.734
attack another child.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.569
I'm not a child.

24:29.602 --> 24:31.938
And he didn't
attack me.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.973
I followed him
to his room,

24:34.006 --> 24:35.608
because I wanted to
be with him.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.610
And were you?

24:40.179 --> 24:42.114
Madison.

24:42.148 --> 24:45.652
If he didn't attack you
and it was consensual,

24:45.685 --> 24:47.219
then you need to
tell us that.

24:47.253 --> 24:50.156
He didn't force me.

24:50.189 --> 24:52.725
We're soul mates.

24:52.759 --> 24:55.628
I've been dreaming
that this would happen.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.664
That he would
fall in love with me.

25:00.332 --> 25:04.604
So I went to his bathroom

25:04.637 --> 25:07.940
and took some of his pills
just to calm my nerves.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.576
Madison.

25:09.609 --> 25:10.843
Miss Baker, please.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.178
Madison, go on.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.016
I guess the pills
were strong,

25:17.049 --> 25:22.722
or maybe it was the cocktails
at the party, but--

25:22.755 --> 25:23.723
a lot's fuzzy.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.191
Madison.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.661
Do you remember having sex
with Scott Russo?

25:29.696 --> 25:32.799
Yes.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.934
He was so gentle.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.637
That's how I know that he
would never hurt me.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.907
Okay.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.644
We will be back
in a minute.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.250
Got him on statutory rape.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.518
We can charge Russo.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.021
Hold on, Madison's changed her
statement how many times now?

25:55.054 --> 25:56.022
Several.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.590
A few.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.092
Girl was traumatized
and under the influence.

26:00.126 --> 26:01.594
Which also doesn't help?

26:01.628 --> 26:02.762
Yeah, if I'm
Russo's lawyer,

26:02.795 --> 26:04.196
I'm gonna paint her
as a crazy fan

26:04.230 --> 26:05.798
who admitted to using
drugs and alcohol,

26:05.832 --> 26:06.799
who stalked him.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.234
Save it for night school?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.602
What about his alibi?

26:10.903 --> 26:13.005
Catalina Soren isn't
calling us back.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.274
Might be 'cause she wasn't
in the room with Russo.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.744
We have video evidence he
kissed Madison at the bar,

26:17.777 --> 26:19.278
did body shots off her.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.713
That's at least endangering
the welfare of a child.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.014
Come on.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.616
We also have video of him

26:23.650 --> 26:24.751
talking to her right outside
his hotel room door.

26:24.784 --> 26:25.752
(Fin)
And if we show the jury that,

26:25.785 --> 26:26.753
his lawyer's gonna ask

26:26.786 --> 26:28.020
why we didn't show
them the rest,

26:28.054 --> 26:29.055
and they're gonna wonder
what was on it.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.090
I'm wondering
the same thing.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.027
(Lenny)
I got to thank you guys.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.963
Some of my best sources
are in your offices.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.264
(Barba)
Care to share any names?

26:38.297 --> 26:39.999
I never reveal
a source.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.968
(Benson)
Look, we don't care
where you got it, Lenny.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.670
We just need to see
the rest.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.705
Wouldn't know how to get
that for you.

26:45.738 --> 26:46.939
(Barba)
Withholding evidence

26:46.973 --> 26:49.041
is a Class E felony,
Mr. Simmons.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.410
I don't have the video
in my possession,

26:51.443 --> 26:53.680
so there's no physical
evidence being withheld.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.047
Well, then,
who does have it?

26:56.115 --> 26:57.283
My source
is my source.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.085
First Amendment guarantees
that journalists

26:59.118 --> 27:00.753
don't have to reveal
that information.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.889
But, hang on,
that's for real journalists.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.691
You're not even
tabloid trash.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.425
[laughs]
You wound me.

27:06.458 --> 27:10.329
Hey, Counselor, tell her about
New York Press Shield Law.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.430
(Barba)
He's right.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.733
Even LMZ has
absolute protection

27:13.766 --> 27:14.867
for confidential news.

27:14.901 --> 27:17.804
To compel,
the hurdles are very high.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.205
You've got to
be kidding me.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.941
Don't mess with LMZ.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.710
You want to threaten
a police officer?

27:23.743 --> 27:25.377
Go ahead, tough guy,
take a swing.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.314
You take one first.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.716
Come on, Nick.
Let's go.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.718
Maybe I will.

27:31.751 --> 27:32.752
Okay.

27:32.785 --> 27:33.953
Oh, um...

27:33.986 --> 27:35.021
I almost forgot.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.756
Here.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.325
Whoever showed you tape
impersonated NYPD to steal it,

27:39.358 --> 27:40.860
which means you have
direct knowledge

27:40.893 --> 27:41.894
of criminal wrongdoing.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.096
So tomorrow, you can either

27:44.130 --> 27:45.765
reveal your source
to a grand jury

27:45.798 --> 27:47.767
or they will hold you
in contempt.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.771
Bring your toothbrush.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.843
Lenny's a third-rate hack,

27:56.876 --> 27:58.244
although he wants
everyone to think

27:58.277 --> 27:59.411
he's Woodward
and Bernstein.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.412
You know,
he may not show.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.048
Don't forget,

28:02.081 --> 28:03.349
before he became a vulture,
he was a lawyer.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.117
Yeah, a distinction
without a difference.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.753
It means he knows if he
doesn't show, he goes to jail.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.420
Yeah, he doesn't have the stones
for that.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.922
Agreed.
All bat, no balls.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.125
Guess who didn't show?

28:13.159 --> 28:15.127
I just spent the past two hours
with 23 grand jurors

28:15.161 --> 28:16.195
playing Sudoku.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.429
(Olivia)
It's Friday.

28:17.463 --> 28:20.032
How about we pick him up
at the end of the day.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.901
(Barba)
So he can't get processed
until Monday

28:21.934 --> 28:24.503
and has to spend the weekend
at The Tombs?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.105
Motherhood has really
changed you, Liv,

28:26.138 --> 28:27.239
brought out your sweet side.

28:27.273 --> 28:28.307
[laughs]

28:29.408 --> 28:30.376
Do it.

28:30.409 --> 28:31.744
Thank you.

28:32.444 --> 28:35.748
Here you go.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.184
That's a wrap, folks.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.186
Have a great weekend.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.922
If you can't come in Sunday,
don't come in Monday.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.423
Lenny Simmons.

28:44.456 --> 28:45.792
We missed you
at court today.

28:45.825 --> 28:46.993
Hey, Lenny.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.327
Where's that bat?

28:48.360 --> 28:51.163
You know, failure to appear
is contempt.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.432
All right, yeah,
get those cameras rolling.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.034
This is NYPD harassment,

28:55.067 --> 28:57.103
trying to force me to reveal
a confidential source.

28:57.136 --> 28:58.805
Atta boy, Lenny.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.973
(Lenny)
They may have no respect
for the Constitution,

29:01.007 --> 29:03.943
but I am willing to die
to respect those rights.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.778
I know this is gonna be
hard for you,

29:05.812 --> 29:07.213
but you have the right
to remain silent.

29:13.052 --> 29:13.252
.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.186
- How'd it go?
- Judge threw him in The Tombs.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.789
Look, until he gives up
that video or his source

29:16.823 --> 29:18.190
we can't make a case.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.992
(Amaro)
Why should Lenny Simmons
give it up?

29:20.026 --> 29:21.327
I mean, this is goosing
his ratings

29:21.360 --> 29:23.462
while he's got his feet up
in protective custody.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.965
We could put a UC
in his cell.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.199
He's under arrest.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.836
NYPD can't have
an ex-parte conversation.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.804
About his case.

29:31.838 --> 29:35.975
But if he gives us information
about somebody else,

29:36.008 --> 29:37.143
that's fair game.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.145
Is it?

29:39.178 --> 29:40.246
I didn't hear
any of this.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.985
[door clanking]

29:48.087 --> 29:49.455
Hey, hey.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.523
You think
you got eyes on me?

29:51.557 --> 29:53.125
You ain't got eyes.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.193
You don't know eyes.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.427
Hey, man, we're
all good here.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.528
I got eyes.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.030
I got eyes right here
in my teeth.

29:58.064 --> 29:59.131
[growls]

29:59.165 --> 30:00.232
Hey, mop boy.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.467
Somebody vomit
by the toilets.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.501
Go make yourself useful.

30:04.871 --> 30:07.539
Ciao.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.041
Solitaire?

30:09.075 --> 30:10.309
You can't do that
in here.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.078
You got to be on a team.

30:12.111 --> 30:13.379
I don't need protection.

30:13.412 --> 30:18.117
It's just a little advice
from a true LMZ fan.

30:19.952 --> 30:20.920
You a fan?

30:20.953 --> 30:22.488
Hell yeah.

30:22.521 --> 30:26.058
The way you take it to them
Hollywood clowns,

30:26.092 --> 30:28.394
I can't do nothing
but respect that.

30:28.427 --> 30:31.864
Where I'm from,
talk crap, you get shot.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.099
[laughs]

30:33.132 --> 30:35.401
I've come close
a few times.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.903
What's your name again?

30:36.936 --> 30:38.237
Call me Big G.

30:38.270 --> 30:41.040
Big G?
Lenny.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.109
You play Gin?

30:43.142 --> 30:45.244
You know, you and me,
we're not that different.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.578
Is that right?

30:46.612 --> 30:49.115
Yeah, you got your kind
of juice, I got mine.

30:49.148 --> 30:51.183
Velvet glove, iron fist.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.252
You gonna keep talking,

30:53.285 --> 30:56.288
or we gonna play cards,
Lenny?

30:56.322 --> 30:58.090
[laughs]

30:58.124 --> 30:59.358
(Lenny)
I got 'em all runnin' scared.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.993
(Fin)
Yeah, whatever you say, Lenny.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.228
(Lenny)
No, I got a vault

31:02.261 --> 31:05.431
of sex videos, drug videos,
bestiality.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.598
(Fin)
Wait a minute.

31:06.632 --> 31:09.201
You have video on this guy,

31:09.235 --> 31:11.904
and you're doing time
to protect him?

31:11.938 --> 31:13.239
You're dumber than you look.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.673
(Lenny)
I'm protecting my operation.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.608
I'm thinking about
the big picture.

31:16.642 --> 31:19.411
The real dirt on what happened
last night is in the vault.

31:19.445 --> 31:21.080
That's my juice.

31:22.648 --> 31:25.217
What is this?

31:25.251 --> 31:28.354
You know, the first rule
of the vault

31:28.387 --> 31:30.356
is there is no vault.

31:32.191 --> 31:35.327
Mr. Simmons, I believe
you've met Big G.

31:35.361 --> 31:36.662
(Fin)
Detective Tutuola.

31:36.695 --> 31:40.332
Yeah, me and Lenny, we had
a nice, long talk in there,

31:40.366 --> 31:41.600
right, Len?

31:41.633 --> 31:44.070
Remember this part?

31:44.103 --> 31:46.973
(Lenny)
Russo's manager gives me
the PG-13 video,

31:47.006 --> 31:49.375
the triple-X stuff
disappears.

31:51.277 --> 31:53.679
You didn't inform me
you were a cop.

31:53.712 --> 31:55.414
Whatever you got
can't be used.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.949
No, see, Lenny,

31:56.983 --> 31:58.284
we don't need to get
anything from you.

31:58.317 --> 32:01.220
You already gave us your source,
Lydia Lebasi.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.491
Tell us what went down,
no one finds out you helped.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.593
Refuse to cooperate,
we release you

32:07.626 --> 32:10.296
and leak that you talked
to save your own skin.

32:12.999 --> 32:16.335
See, the court of public
opinion's a harsh one.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.470
But you already knew that.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.676
(Lenny)
Until this show trial ends,

32:24.710 --> 32:27.513
I have agreed to wear
an ankle bracelet.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.748
I don't care how long
they hold me in contempt.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.219
The judge can drop dead
in his black robe

32:33.252 --> 32:36.522
before Lenny Simmons gives up
the name of a source.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.490
The great defender
of the free press

32:38.524 --> 32:40.426
falls apart
like a cheap suit.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.428
(Fin)
Russo's manager is on her way.

32:42.461 --> 32:44.263
She's got plenty
of clients.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.265
Can't be fun cleaning up
Russo's messes.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.767
Maybe she'll
cut him loose.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.436
(Barba)
We know you helped Scott
cover up

32:50.469 --> 32:51.603
a rape
and attempted murder.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.072
That makes you a conspirator.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.207
You'll go down
for a felony yourself.

32:55.241 --> 32:57.243
Or you give us that
missing footage.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.146
Lenny dropped my name?

33:01.147 --> 33:03.615
That little bitch.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.317
Let him give you
the missing footage

33:05.351 --> 33:06.252
if he knows so much.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.453
Didn't you hear
the news?

33:07.486 --> 33:09.588
Lenny Simmons is
a free press crusader.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.090
(Amaro)
You, on the other hand,

33:11.123 --> 33:14.060
are just Scott Russo's
cleaning lady.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.062
He's really worth
20 years in jail?

33:16.095 --> 33:17.763
I swear I don't have
the footage.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.031
LMZ does.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.133
But you were there.

33:21.167 --> 33:22.734
So what happened?

33:22.768 --> 33:25.304
Last chance, Miss Lebasi.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.342
Scott calls me
around 1:00 A.M.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.744
"Come up to my suite.
I've got a problem."

33:32.778 --> 33:35.181
Problem?
Try career suicide.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.516
A 15-year-old OD'd
in his bed,

33:37.549 --> 33:39.318
and all he can whine about
is being cursed.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.686
What did you do?

33:40.719 --> 33:42.821
My job.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.691
Picked up a cheap suitcase,
had him put her in it,

33:45.724 --> 33:47.359
he wheeled her out.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.528
I got all traces of her
out of the room.

33:49.561 --> 33:52.198
Wiped prints,
stripped the bed.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.199
Then you called LMZ

33:53.232 --> 33:54.600
and 'em pull that
security video.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.602
He swore he wouldn't
release any of it.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.237
They screwed me
with that exclusive

33:58.270 --> 34:00.272
of Scott and the girl
in the hallway.

34:00.306 --> 34:02.141
An ethical lapse by LMZ.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.343
I'm shocked.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.478
They didn't commit a crime,
you did.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.255
Scott's going down anyway,
isn't he?

34:19.225 --> 34:21.360
I'll tell you the truth.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.129
The whole truth

34:23.162 --> 34:25.264
and nothing
but the truth.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.601
I think that salmon
was farm raised.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.370
Told you you should have
had the burger, man.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.572
Totally grass fed.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.141
(Fin)
Scott Russo.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.408
What, are you guys
stalking him?

34:36.442 --> 34:37.409
Stalking?

34:37.443 --> 34:38.677
He's on Foursquare.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.246
Every move you make
is a public act.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.348
Including this.

34:42.381 --> 34:45.684
You're under arrest for
the rape of Madison Baker.

34:45.717 --> 34:46.685
I know you guys hate me,

34:46.718 --> 34:48.220
but I did not do this.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.221
All right,
I'm being set up.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.256
(Carisi)
Oh, falsely accused?

34:50.289 --> 34:51.357
Life imitates art.

34:51.390 --> 34:52.458
I get it.

34:53.925 --> 34:54.893
Jeez, Scott.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.195
Hey, I'll call Lydia.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.130
No, Lydia can't
help me anymore.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.165
Call my lawyer.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.204
(Amaro)
Well, I'll say this
for Scott Russo.

35:05.237 --> 35:06.538
He does take
a pretty mug shot.

35:06.572 --> 35:08.307
(Benson)
So how long till that's on LMZ?

35:08.340 --> 35:09.741
My daughter needs to
speak with you.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.277
(Amaro)
Madison,
what's going on?

35:11.310 --> 35:12.611
Why did you arrest Scott?

35:12.644 --> 35:14.146
I told you that
he didn't hurt me.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.215
(Benson)
It's okay, Madison.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.284
His manager Lydia
told us everything.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.385
What did she say?

35:19.418 --> 35:22.221
That you OD'd
in his hotel room

35:22.254 --> 35:24.256
after he had sex with you,

35:24.290 --> 35:26.258
and then they
put you in the suitcase,

35:26.292 --> 35:27.226
and they dumped you.

35:39.538 --> 35:39.738
.

35:39.771 --> 35:40.706
Hold on, now you're saying
you and Scott Russo

35:41.173 --> 35:42.808
did not have sex?

35:42.841 --> 35:44.376
No.

35:44.410 --> 35:45.777
We made out a little
at the party,

35:45.811 --> 35:48.380
but once he found out
how old I was,

35:48.414 --> 35:49.448
he got scared.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.218
So you followed him

35:52.251 --> 35:53.819
to his hotel suite.

35:53.852 --> 35:55.821
He opened the door.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.923
I saw Catalina Soren,
from his movie.

35:57.956 --> 36:01.760
She was behind him,
in a robe.

36:01.793 --> 36:03.629
She's so beautiful.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.331
Then what happened?

36:05.364 --> 36:08.300
He told me I was
a nice girl,

36:08.334 --> 36:10.702
but too young for him.

36:10.736 --> 36:11.970
He told me to go home.

36:12.003 --> 36:17.243
I just--I started crying
after he closed the door.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.910
That's when Skye came out.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.846
That's Skye Adderson.

36:20.879 --> 36:25.584
Yeah, he invited me into
his room to clean myself up.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.854
We had more drinks.

36:28.887 --> 36:32.891
I took some of his pills.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.894
He was so understanding
about Scott,

36:35.927 --> 36:38.630
telling me
what a jerk he was.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.966
We started making out.

36:42.434 --> 36:43.402
I'm sorry, mom.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.403
It's okay, honey.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.438
Just tell the truth.

36:47.873 --> 36:51.410
We had sex.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.711
Everything is hazy.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.846
Next thing I know,
I'm in the hospital.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.283
Madison.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.385
Why didn't you tell us
from the beginning

36:59.418 --> 37:00.719
that it was Skye?

37:00.752 --> 37:02.621
Because I didn't want Scott
to find out

37:02.654 --> 37:04.923
that I had
cheated on him.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.892
I knew that he would
never forgive me.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.702
She's finally telling
the truth.

37:16.735 --> 37:17.936
(Barba)
Good for her.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.471
Too bad she's lied
so many times,

37:19.505 --> 37:20.539
the jury won't believe
a word she says.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.841
Well, I still don't.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.976
Look, you heard Lydia Lebasi,
right?

37:25.010 --> 37:26.478
She pinned everything
on Scott.

37:26.512 --> 37:27.913
Now, why frame
her own client

37:27.946 --> 37:30.482
and risk imprisonment
to protect Adderson?

37:30.516 --> 37:31.717
Let's just ask her.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.619
Yeah, it'd be easier
to control the conversation

37:33.652 --> 37:34.853
if we had that
missing footage.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.655
So let her think
that we do.

37:40.626 --> 37:41.627
[knocks on door]

37:43.028 --> 37:44.696
(Benson)
Hi.

37:44.730 --> 37:45.831
Sergeant Benson
from SVU.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.333
I'm sorry for
the interruption.

37:47.366 --> 37:49.535
Just have a few
more questions.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.870
We already spoke with
your detectives.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.473
Forgive us, but we have a flight
to catch to New Zealand.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.774
(Fin)
New Zealand?

37:55.807 --> 37:56.942
Isn't that where
Catalina Soren's

37:56.975 --> 37:58.410
shooting that new
Catalyst movie?

37:58.444 --> 37:59.711
Yeah, it's a trilogy.

37:59.745 --> 38:02.648
Skye just got cast
as the Catalyst himself.

38:02.681 --> 38:03.982
OH, that's big time, man.

38:04.015 --> 38:05.751
What's that like,
10 mil a pop?

38:05.784 --> 38:06.918
I always thought
you were more

38:06.952 --> 38:07.919
kind of like
a indie guy?

38:07.953 --> 38:09.588
Even bad boys grow up.

38:09.621 --> 38:10.956
Now, I'm sorry, please.

38:10.989 --> 38:13.825
Yeah, we just have a couple
of timeline questions, Skye.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.895
So, where did you go
after the party?

38:16.928 --> 38:18.063
I-I went to Lydia's room,

38:18.096 --> 38:20.666
and we were
actually strategizing

38:20.699 --> 38:21.667
about the Catalyst.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.001
All right, okay.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.403
And what time
was that?

38:25.404 --> 38:26.605
Was 1:00 A.M.?

38:26.638 --> 38:28.374
I fell asleep
on her couch?

38:28.407 --> 38:30.342
I thought that this was
taken care of.

38:30.376 --> 38:31.810
It is.
Relax.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.545
We have to get to JFK.

38:33.579 --> 38:34.580
We can give you a ride.

38:34.613 --> 38:35.914
Sirens, lights,
you know.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.549
You ever done that?
It's a trip.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.850
So, Skye,
just to be clear,

38:38.884 --> 38:41.853
you're saying that--
that you never saw Madison,

38:41.887 --> 38:44.022
maybe in the hallway,
maybe crying?

38:44.055 --> 38:45.357
Of course not.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.925
He was with me.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.027
Well, the problem is,

38:49.060 --> 38:50.562
that doesn't really jive

38:50.596 --> 38:53.031
with the hotel
security footage.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.533
Well--

38:54.566 --> 38:55.967
The footage--the footage
was--is gone.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.869
Who told you that?

38:57.903 --> 38:59.871
No, LMZ has had that footage
in a vault,

38:59.905 --> 39:02.741
and--and your manager
finally gave them the okay

39:02.774 --> 39:03.909
to release
it to us.

39:03.942 --> 39:05.043
They're lying.
Skye, I didn't--

39:05.076 --> 39:06.044
Okay, Skye.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.614
So back to the video.

39:08.647 --> 39:12.418
Now, we have you at 1:00
in the morning, right?

39:12.451 --> 39:14.520
Consoling Madison
and then escorting her

39:14.553 --> 39:15.687
into your hotel room.

39:15.721 --> 39:16.855
And then later on,
we got you

39:16.888 --> 39:19.591
wheeling that suitcase out
around 2:45 A.M.

39:19.625 --> 39:20.759
What--what is going on?

39:20.792 --> 39:22.093
- No, no, no, no.
- Skye!

39:22.127 --> 39:23.529
That's not right.

39:23.562 --> 39:24.763
What about Lydia
coming in to my room,

39:24.796 --> 39:25.864
bringing in the suitcase.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.399
You don't have that
on tape?

39:27.433 --> 39:28.567
Definitely not,
but nice try.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.068
So you're saying
it's all her idea?

39:32.070 --> 39:33.839
I'm--I'm so sorry, Lydia.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.574
I can't go down
for this.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.409
I know, Skye.

39:37.443 --> 39:38.977
Don't worry, honey.

39:39.010 --> 39:40.446
He's telling the truth.

39:40.479 --> 39:41.547
It was my idea.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.748
He wanted to call
an ambulance.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.816
I told him no.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.986
I said I didn't want
some stupid girl

39:48.019 --> 39:49.921
to screw up
the Catalyst deal.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.790
Okay, you don't have to
cover for your client.

39:51.823 --> 39:52.791
She's not covering for me.

39:52.824 --> 39:54.059
I am innocent.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.895
I am--I had no idea how old
that girl was,

39:56.928 --> 39:58.029
and Madison,

39:58.063 --> 39:59.698
she took the drugs
from my dopp kit.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.567
You know, the station
is right down the road.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.201
So how about the four of us
go there,

40:03.234 --> 40:04.770
and we can
sort this out?

40:04.803 --> 40:05.937
No, no, no,
let him get on the plane.

40:05.971 --> 40:06.938
Let him go to New Zealand.

40:06.972 --> 40:08.574
It was my idea,
take me.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.075
We should all go.

40:10.108 --> 40:11.577
What's gonna happen now?

40:11.610 --> 40:12.544
I don't know what to do.

40:12.578 --> 40:13.545
What do we do?

40:13.579 --> 40:14.646
Shh.

40:17.816 --> 40:21.119
Don't worry,
my beautiful boy.

40:21.152 --> 40:23.154
Everything's gonna be
all right.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.125
- Okay.
- It's gonna be all right.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.500
Given new evidence in
Skye Adderson's confession,

40:34.533 --> 40:35.967
People have no objection.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.669
Then the motion to dismiss
the indictment

40:37.703 --> 40:38.937
is so ordered.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.839
You're free to go,
Mr. Russo.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.874
[crowd gasps]

40:58.624 --> 41:00.058
Hey, if you're looking
for that apology--

41:00.091 --> 41:01.259
(Scott)
No.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.661
Actually, I want to
thank you.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.062
You do?

41:04.095 --> 41:05.597
Yeah, for getting
to the truth.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.833
As painful as it is,
I can't believe Lydia set me up

41:07.866 --> 41:10.802
because I refused to
compromise my integrity.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.538
Come again?

41:12.571 --> 41:14.640
I mean, I always thought
she believed in me.

41:14.673 --> 41:17.876
But I guess she found
a brighter, shinier boy.

41:23.949 --> 41:26.952
[crowd screams]

41:29.020 --> 41:30.822
It's been a tough week.

41:30.856 --> 41:32.924
That people I love
would destroy me

41:32.958 --> 41:34.960
for status and money

41:34.993 --> 41:37.128
is the ultimate betrayal.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.229
Check, please.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.831
(Scott)
There's a lesson here.

41:39.865 --> 41:42.801
The manna that consumes
Hollywood creates the basis

41:42.834 --> 41:45.704
for disrespecting one's
true self

41:45.737 --> 41:47.939
and for hurting others.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.708
Falsely Accused...

41:52.611 --> 41:55.246
Well, it's not a just a movie.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.882
It happened to me.

41:56.915 --> 41:59.918
[crowd screaming]
