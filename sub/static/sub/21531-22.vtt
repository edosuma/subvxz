WEBVTT

00:04.538 --> 00:08.809
Wow, this baby name book
is really great.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.444
Ooh, here's a pretty one.

00:10.478 --> 00:12.513
Clitorissa.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.286
That's "Clarissa".

00:18.319 --> 00:20.020
Oh, well,
that's just gross.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.457
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

00:23.491 --> 00:26.260
Grace, that's for you.

00:26.294 --> 00:29.263
Oh, my God, it's the Bugaboo
Gecko suspension stroller.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.631
It's a knockoff.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.400
I got it from
the evidence locker.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.534
But don't
touch the inside.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.103
I still gotta
dust it for prints

00:35.136 --> 00:37.037
and scrape it
for a blood match.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.440
Uh...

00:39.473 --> 00:41.409
Thanks, Vince.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.277
It's the first gift
I've ever received

00:43.311 --> 00:46.147
that was part
of a crime scene.

00:46.180 --> 00:49.117
Second.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.353
Anyway,
we're done here, right?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.355
Because I'm meeting
my sister Ginny for lunch,

00:54.388 --> 00:55.189
and I'm running late.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.526
Did--did you
just say "sister"?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.428
Yeah.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.163
I have lunch with Gin
every Thursday.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.331
What's the big?

01:05.399 --> 01:08.136
Uh, maybe the fact
that you have never mentioned

01:08.169 --> 01:10.438
that you have a sister?

01:10.471 --> 01:13.474
Mmm...
Yeah, I think I have, Grace.

01:15.443 --> 01:18.279
What do you think
I'm talking about when I say,

01:18.312 --> 01:21.382
"Boy, do I love Gin."

01:21.415 --> 01:24.084
Or, "I can't get through the day
without Gin."

01:25.919 --> 01:30.524
"That Gin gave me
such a headache last night."

01:30.558 --> 01:32.426
Boy, I couldn't have
been more clear.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.461
Geez.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.695
Next thing I know,
you'll tell me

01:34.728 --> 01:35.896
you never heard me mention

01:35.929 --> 01:38.399
my brother-in-law,
Johnnie Walker.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.335
[upbeat piano jazz]

01:41.369 --> 01:44.104
*

01:57.818 --> 01:59.620
Okay, look, I didn't
want to say anything

01:59.653 --> 02:02.423
in front of
Jack and Karen,

02:02.456 --> 02:04.358
but, um...

02:04.392 --> 02:07.228
I know what I want
to name the baby. George.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.297
After my dad?

02:09.330 --> 02:11.799
No, after
the curious monkey.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.703
And by that,
I mean our president.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.876
Your dad...

02:22.910 --> 02:24.778
He meant a lot
to both of us,

02:24.812 --> 02:26.314
and I just thought
it would be really nice

02:26.347 --> 02:27.248
if we honored him.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.716
Wow.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.917
I mean,
I'm so touched,

02:29.950 --> 02:31.319
but it--

02:31.352 --> 02:32.920
Are you sure you're
comfortable doing that

02:32.953 --> 02:34.255
when you haven't even
told Leo yet?

02:34.288 --> 02:35.456
Yes.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.426
Look, I don't even know

02:38.459 --> 02:40.394
how Leo's gonna
fit into the picture.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.796
I mean, Lord knows, I've tried
to get in touch with him.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.798
He's getting married.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.934
So essentially,
it's just you and me.

02:46.967 --> 02:49.203
And I want us
to name him George.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.438
Thank you.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.805
I love that.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.341
Mwah.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.942
Uh, what if it's a girl?

02:54.975 --> 02:57.445
Oh, I guess "Boy George".

03:02.250 --> 03:03.451
Ah, Smitty.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.256
I think I'll
have a martini.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.923
I'm meeting my sister
for lunch today.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.425
I had a sister.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.894
But when the tornado came,

03:13.927 --> 03:17.865
we'd already boarded up
the cellar door.

03:20.334 --> 03:24.438
She hung on to the pickup
as long as she could,

03:24.472 --> 03:27.741
but we found her
on top of the school.

03:30.811 --> 03:31.812
[laughs]

03:34.882 --> 03:39.720
Sid! What a story!

03:39.753 --> 03:44.358
I can just see her
going 'round and 'round.

03:44.392 --> 03:47.828
Oh, now I'm in the mood
for something blended.

03:50.364 --> 03:53.334
Oh... Anyway...

03:53.367 --> 03:56.003
Ginny had an accident
when we were children.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.340
I mean, nothing funny
like your family, but...

03:59.373 --> 04:03.010
You know, some people could have
gotten very bitter.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.745
But...not Gin.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.847
No, she's a brave gal.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.351
Just soldiers on
as if nothing happened.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.752
Stop staring at me.

04:11.785 --> 04:12.920
What are you all looking at?

04:14.555 --> 04:16.290
The freak whose left leg

04:16.324 --> 04:18.492
is three-eighths of an inch
shorter than the right?

04:18.526 --> 04:19.993
Gin, please.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.330
If they were looking at anyone,
it was me.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.766
My boob popped out
before you got here.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.836
Apparently it stayed out
for quite some time.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.839
I only realized it when Smitty
lifted it to get his tip.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.345
At least your boob
doesn't need

04:37.378 --> 04:39.046
to wear an orthotic.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.382
Well, uh...

04:41.415 --> 04:43.517
Listen, Gin?

04:43.551 --> 04:44.852
You know how I've been

04:44.885 --> 04:47.421
supporting you
for all these years?

04:47.455 --> 04:51.825
If you can call
$300,000 a month support.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.961
For the sake of argument,
let's say we can.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.898
Now that Stanley and I
are getting a divorce,

04:57.931 --> 04:59.533
I'm afraid that
I won't be able

04:59.567 --> 05:00.968
to send you
those checks anymore.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.070
I'm sorry,
say that again?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.638
I didn't hear you

05:04.672 --> 05:07.007
because one of my legs
is shorter than the other.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.009
You're such a pessimist, Gin.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.344
Why not say,

05:10.378 --> 05:13.046
"One of my legs
is freakishly long"?

05:15.115 --> 05:17.084
Hey, look who it is!
Hi, Kare.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.086
This must be
your sister Virginia.

05:19.119 --> 05:23.491
Yes. Uh, Virginia,
you remember me mentioning
my friend Jack.

05:23.524 --> 05:27.595
Wow, the resemblance
is uncanny...

05:27.628 --> 05:30.598
meaning both of you
have huge cans.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.636
I don't know, but something's
different about you.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.539
From the way you're sitting,
I'd say one of your legs

05:38.572 --> 05:40.608
is slightly shorter
than the other.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.077
I knew a guy
like that once.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.979
He died.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.949
Come on, get out of here.

05:48.982 --> 05:49.983
We're having a private
family discussion.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.119
Well, I'm family.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.054
Nothing would interest
me more than--

05:54.087 --> 05:55.989
Sweet home Alabama,
it's Josh Lucas!

06:01.495 --> 06:03.063
Here, let me know
how that works out for you.

06:09.537 --> 06:12.573
Oh, my God,
I'm such a huge fan.
I love your work!

06:13.907 --> 06:15.576
Okay, who do you
think I am?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.678
[whispers] Josh Lucas.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.013
Then thank you,
it's the first time today.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.982
I've had three
Matthew McConnaugheys,

06:22.015 --> 06:25.653
two Aaron Eckharts,
and Thomas Jane,
whoever that is.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.658
I know you.
You're Jack McFarland.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.560
You play Chuck Rafferty
on The Badge.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.462
Why, I am and I do.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.930
But how would you know that?
It hasn't aired yet.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.699
Yeah, I was up
for that part.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.435
I'd do anything to get out
of big-budget features

06:41.469 --> 06:42.936
and get into basic cable.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.139
I heard you blew
everybody away, though.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.941
Oh, that's the story
they're telling.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.946
Hey, we're having
a premiere party
tomorrow night.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.147
Why don't you
come on by?

06:54.181 --> 06:56.049
Sure. Should I bring
my girlfriend?

06:56.083 --> 07:01.522
Uh, if by girlfriend
you mean "open mind
to experimenting," then yes.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.056
Karen, if you think

07:03.090 --> 07:05.593
you're going to cut me off,
think again,

07:05.626 --> 07:08.496
since we both know
how I ended up like this.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.530
It was an accident.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.197
Was it?

07:10.230 --> 07:11.565
Gin, please!

07:11.599 --> 07:13.166
Stop begging.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.036
Oh, no, I was ordering.
Gin, please!

07:18.772 --> 07:20.107
Please, you have
to forgive me.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.676
I have no other choice.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.011
The question is,
can you forgive yourself

07:24.044 --> 07:25.145
for casting me out

07:25.178 --> 07:27.615
after leaving me
so hideously deformed?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.483
Unable to dance.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.118
To skip.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.687
To read.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.156
Why can't you read?

07:36.189 --> 07:37.991
Eh, I don't want to.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.531
Okay, ready?
One, two, three--

07:43.564 --> 07:44.565
Surprise.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.002
Wow, an empty room.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.604
Is the surprise

07:50.638 --> 07:52.506
that you're just
not good at surprises?

07:52.540 --> 07:55.242
Will, remember that stroller
I got from that drug gang?

07:55.275 --> 07:59.046
Turns out this is where
they had their meth lab.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.650
Wow.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.052
This has been a fascinating
edition of NYPD Cribs.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.989
Why are we here?

08:09.022 --> 08:10.591
Because I want us
to live together.

08:10.624 --> 08:13.093
Why are you such a bitch
all the time?

08:15.763 --> 08:17.230
You want to move in together?

08:17.264 --> 08:19.066
Yeah, I want us
to buy this place together.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.134
I can get it
for a great deal.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.571
It's got three bedrooms,
a back yard.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.272
Look, right now
they're using it for--

08:25.305 --> 08:27.741
Just don't look
in the backyard right now.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.243
So what do you say?

08:30.277 --> 08:35.148
I say nothing
would make me happier

08:35.182 --> 08:37.651
than to turn this
humble little drug den

08:37.685 --> 08:39.753
into our home.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.055
I love you, Will.
I love you too.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.192
Is that a basement?

08:45.225 --> 08:46.727
Yeah, don't go down there.

08:50.097 --> 08:54.234
Wow, you really went all out
for Jack's premiere party.

08:54.267 --> 08:58.338
I love how you put
the posters up of The Badge.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.841
Wait, does that say
"The Vadge"?

09:02.242 --> 09:04.344
Yeah...

09:04.377 --> 09:07.014
That's the last time that
I place an order with Kinko's

09:07.047 --> 09:08.849
over the phone.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.820
You know, maybe I should've
said "B as in boy"

09:12.853 --> 09:15.555
instead of
"B as in bagina."

09:17.224 --> 09:21.094
Yeah, it's unfortunate
that the show's tagline is,

09:21.128 --> 09:23.363
"Go deep inside
a hidden world

09:23.396 --> 09:24.965
that few dare to enter."

09:28.135 --> 09:29.670
Oh, my God, you guys.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.005
You're never gonna
believe who's here.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.908
Me!

09:34.942 --> 09:36.610
I heard rumors
I wasn't going to show,

09:36.644 --> 09:38.145
but I'm really here.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.247
Thanks for my party, Kare.
I love it.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.248
Oh, honey,
it was my pleasure.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.083
And it was easy.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.052
You know, I didn't even have
to invite any of your friends

09:45.085 --> 09:46.253
because they were
already coming.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.155
Say hello, boys.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.690
(waiters)
Hi, Jack.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.124
Hey, Dalton.
Hey, Mario.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.392
Thanks for coming
to my big opening.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.028
Did that sound weird?

09:57.397 --> 10:00.634
Thanks for making
my opening so big.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.135
We wouldn't miss it, Jack.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.104
We're so proud of you.

10:04.137 --> 10:07.675
Can't believe that puffy queen
got a TV show.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.377
I thought they canceled
Fat Actress.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.015
You tell Grace
the good news.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.249
I got to go tell Jack

10:16.283 --> 10:17.250
something that happened
at work today

10:17.284 --> 10:19.019
that'll make a great episode
on The Badge.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.253
Check it out.

10:20.287 --> 10:24.191
We actually had a stakeout
at a steakhouse.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.226
Come on, you can't
make that crap up.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.697
What's the news?

10:29.730 --> 10:32.132
Vince and I found a place.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.068
It is a beautiful brownstone
in Harlem.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.004
And we're going
to buy it!

10:37.037 --> 10:38.438
Oh, my God.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.173
Re--really?

10:40.207 --> 10:41.909
Yeah, it's perfect.
It's got everything.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.110
It's even got one of those
ironing boards

10:43.143 --> 10:44.244
that fold down
from the wall.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.179
Oh!

10:46.213 --> 10:50.183
A gay white man ironing
in his Harlem brownstone.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.153
I can't wait
for the neighbors to drop by.

10:53.186 --> 10:56.189
You know, to--
to beat the piss out of me.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.392
Wow.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.194
So, you're moving.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.764
Grace, we're all moving.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.065
I figured
the third floor

11:05.098 --> 11:06.433
will be just for you
and the baby.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.235
Really?

11:08.268 --> 11:09.269
Uh-huh.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.470
Oh, my God.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.139
This is so exciting.

11:12.172 --> 11:16.009
I just want to say thank you
for being here tonight.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.078
It really means
a lot to me.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.248
I know I've never
said this to you before,

11:21.281 --> 11:25.085
but... I love you.

11:25.118 --> 11:28.221
That means the world to me.
I love you, too.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.457
What? Oh, no.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.225
I wasn't talking
to you, dear.

11:32.259 --> 11:35.028
I was looking at myself
in the reflection
of your sunglasses

11:35.062 --> 11:36.730
to see what I'll look like
when I talk to Josh Lucas.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.400
I'm so tired of falling
in love with gay men.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.138
Hey, glad you could
make it, J.Lu.

11:48.541 --> 11:52.245
Hello, everyone.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.081
What are you all
staring at, me?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.082
Because I'm hideous?

11:55.115 --> 11:56.083
Well, all right.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.417
Let's get it
out in the open.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.788
I've got a bum leg,
and I'm Karen's sister.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.390
Uh, Gin,
what a surprise.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.258
What are you doing here?

12:05.292 --> 12:06.994
Didn't I tell you?
I'm moving in.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.129
Since you refuse
to continue

12:09.162 --> 12:10.230
with my meager
monthly payments,

12:10.263 --> 12:11.498
this is all I can afford.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.134
Now, let's talk
about ramps.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.404
What's she
bitching about?

12:17.437 --> 12:18.538
I got an uncle
who lost a forehead

12:18.571 --> 12:20.407
in a towing accident.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.275
He's gotta wear a special hat
to keep his brains in.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.178
Gosh, Gin, I'm not sure
about you moving in.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.547
It might make Rosie
feel very uncomfortable.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.216
She prides herself
on being

12:29.249 --> 12:31.819
the toughest thing
to look at around here.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.420
Do you hear that,
everyone?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.455
My own sister

12:35.488 --> 12:37.224
is throwing me
out on the street,

12:37.257 --> 12:39.059
and after what
she did to me.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.293
Gin, please!

12:40.327 --> 12:41.461
Thanks.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.296
Gin, please!

12:43.330 --> 12:44.865
What?

12:44.898 --> 12:46.566
Are you afraid
everyone will find out

12:46.599 --> 12:48.568
how you destroyed my life?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.138
It was a crisp fall day.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.040
The country
was still in shock

12:53.073 --> 12:54.574
over the assassination
of the president.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.143
Okay, I'm 90% sure

12:56.176 --> 12:59.446
she's talking about
Kennedy or Garfield.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.182
Father had just brought home
a new game called croquet.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.516
Could be Garfield.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.585
Could be Lincoln.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.888
But Karen wanted
to play Twister.

13:07.921 --> 13:10.057
Kennedy.
Kennedy.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.225
Yes, I wanted
to play Twister.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.194
And I'm so sorry.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.463
If there was any way
I could take it back, I would.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.831
I mean,
I'd still want to play.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.199
It's such a fun game.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.101
But I would play
on a smooth surface,

13:21.134 --> 13:22.836
as recommended on the box.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.440
Where exactly did you play?

13:27.474 --> 13:31.444
The rickety old sawmill
that juts out over the falls.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.082
(Gin)
Tell them, Karen.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.217
Tell them what happened
when you called,

13:37.250 --> 13:39.619
"Right foot red."
They all know.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.156
You leap, you stretch.

13:43.190 --> 13:46.159
You balance, you twist.

13:46.193 --> 13:50.097
You try it once,
you'll get the gist.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.333
But I didn't
get the gist, did I?

13:53.366 --> 13:54.501
No.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.236
You fell.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.571
Through a rotted floorboard.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.640
And broke my ankle.

14:00.673 --> 14:05.278
It healed badly,
and I never danced again.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.914
You danced?

14:06.947 --> 14:09.216
You bet your fat, pregnant ass
I danced.

14:11.985 --> 14:15.155
Okay, now I see
the family resemblance.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.290
I could've been
on Broadway.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.625
You should've seen
my moves.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.161
Hep, hep, hep, hep.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.662
Hep, hep, hep, hep.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.398
Hep, hep!
But because of her,

14:25.432 --> 14:27.400
I can't do that anymore!

14:31.171 --> 14:35.442
Oh, God, what I wouldn't give
to see her dance one more time.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.948
Wow!
I know.

14:40.981 --> 14:43.350
The big drama
at the Poseidon premiere party

14:43.383 --> 14:46.453
was when Richard Dreyfuss
karaoked the theme to Jaws

14:46.486 --> 14:49.356
and bit Goldie Hawn
on the head.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.560
Hilarious!
Kiss me.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.495
What?
Nothing.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.397
Geez, family, huh?

14:57.430 --> 14:59.666
I tell you,
my older sister's a nut too.

14:59.699 --> 15:03.336
If she ever asks, we don't have
that third bedroom upstairs.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.705
Well, we don't.
That bedroom's for Grace.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.374
Oh, yeah.
Well, of course.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.575
When she visits,
she can stay there.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.511
Vince, Grace is going
to be living with us.

15:11.544 --> 15:12.512
With the baby.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.414
What are you talking about?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.682
When did this happen?

15:15.715 --> 15:17.550
Well, where'd you think
they were going to be?

15:17.584 --> 15:18.986
I don't know.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.653
I didn't think it was
going to be in our home.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.622
I made a commitment to her.
You know that.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.324
Yeah, but I didn't think

15:24.357 --> 15:25.725
you'd committed us
to living with her.

15:25.758 --> 15:29.362
Well, how else am I gonna
raise the baby with her?

15:29.396 --> 15:31.598
I just assumed
you were okay with this.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.967
I'm not sure I am.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.468
(Jack)
Okay, everybody.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.237
The show's about to start,
all right?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.538
And remember, you guys,

15:38.571 --> 15:40.707
one day,
this could be you.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.377
But it's not today.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.381
So keep clearing.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.485
[TV theme music]

15:52.519 --> 15:55.255
(male announcer on TV)
Tonight on The Badge:

15:55.288 --> 15:57.024
[deep, dubbed voice]
Okay, scumbag.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.292
This is the end of the road,
and you're out of gas.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.527
I'm Chuck Rafferty.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.330
And this is the last stop
on this train.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.632
Check the overhead bins
before I punch your ticket.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.767
Oh, my God.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.702
That's not my voice!

16:09.736 --> 16:11.504
I've been dubbed.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.507
[squeaking]
Why would anybody
dub my voice?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.250
I thought I might
find you here.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.153
What happened to the door?

16:26.186 --> 16:27.687
I'm a detective.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.222
I picked the lock.

16:29.256 --> 16:31.058
It's in two pieces.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.726
Yeah, I can't pick locks.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.562
I missed work
the day they showed us

16:35.595 --> 16:38.031
because my skin
was really dry.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.633
Look, I know I sprung
the whole Grace thing on you,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.035
but we--
we can work this out.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.236
How, Will?

16:43.270 --> 16:45.372
You've committed to raising
a baby with her.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.240
How is this going to work out?

16:47.274 --> 16:48.741
I know it's an odd situation,
but I--

16:48.775 --> 16:50.343
I'm good with
odd situations, like--

16:50.377 --> 16:51.711
Like in high school,

16:51.744 --> 16:53.046
when all the guys
were talking about

16:53.080 --> 16:54.414
what they'd like to do
to Cheryl Tiegs?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.183
I said, "Braid her hair wet,

16:56.216 --> 16:59.686
make her sleep on it, and use
a volumizer in the morning.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.054
Then nail her."

17:01.088 --> 17:02.722
You know, that's--
see?

17:02.755 --> 17:05.058
If I could make that work,
I can make this work.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.327
Look, Will.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.063
I'm an old-fashioned
homosexual.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.664
Okay?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.234
To me,
family is two guys,

17:14.267 --> 17:16.236
some mid-century furniture,

17:16.269 --> 17:18.205
and a baby that doesn't
look like either one of us.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.742
We can have all that.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.177
We can have both.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.812
No, we can't.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.747
What if our life
takes us somewhere else?

17:27.780 --> 17:30.783
Well, what if we have to move
to Seattle because of my eczema?

17:34.254 --> 17:36.423
How bad is your skin?

17:36.456 --> 17:39.126
You know what I'm saying.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.762
Well, I guess
we wouldn't go.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.464
I mean, how--
how could we?

17:44.497 --> 17:46.766
I'm basically going to be
this baby's father.

17:46.799 --> 17:47.834
Grace needs me.

17:47.867 --> 17:48.968
I need you.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.704
When are you going to stop
playing house with this woman?

17:51.738 --> 17:52.872
That is not what I'm doing.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.308
When are you going to be happy
living a life with just me?

17:55.342 --> 17:57.810
Are you asking me to choose?

18:00.313 --> 18:02.749
I'm afraid to, Will,
because...

18:02.782 --> 18:04.284
I think I already know
the answer.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.692
[sighs] Moe is me.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.263
Hey, guys.

18:16.296 --> 18:19.432
Don't worry, Jack,
no one could tell
you were dubbed.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.336
Really, Dalton?

18:23.370 --> 18:25.905
Absolutely.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.208
I hope so, but I don't know.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.143
People are smarter
than you think.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.244
Wow.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.284
You mind if I sit down?

18:37.317 --> 18:41.921
Oh, I'm so embarrassed
to have you see me
like this, Josh Lucas.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.525
I mean, our careers were
nearly identical until now.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.528
It's like you're Matt Damon
and I'm Ben Affleck

18:48.561 --> 18:51.331
and I just made Gigli.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.436
Or Paycheck.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.306
Or Bounce.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.409
Or Jersey Girl.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.146
Or Surviving Christmas.

19:12.219 --> 19:14.887
Look, you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.823
You wouldn't understand.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.891
No, look, I understand
better than you think.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.761
Look, let me let you in
on a little secret.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.930
[squeaking] This
is my real voice.

19:23.963 --> 19:27.200
I've been dubbed
my entire career.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.501
But how is that possible?

19:28.535 --> 19:30.503
I've heard you talk.
You sound fine.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.805
That's because I've spent
years taking voice lessons

19:32.839 --> 19:34.574
[deep voice]
to sound like this.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.876
[squeaks, then deepens]
It's just that it's
really hard for me

19:36.909 --> 19:38.778
[squeaking] to sustain
for a long period of time.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.980
[decreasing in tone]
Time, time, time, time.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.350
Come on, lock it in, Josh,
lock it in.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.218
[clearing throat]

19:45.252 --> 19:45.918
But...

19:47.854 --> 19:49.422
You're so manly.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.891
I know.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.861
But all the top
leading men are dubbed.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.296
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.197
What about the bottoms?

20:03.403 --> 20:06.906
Rosie, it looks like
my sister's going to be
staying with us for a while,

20:06.939 --> 20:09.309
and I don't want her
to feel self-conscious,

20:09.342 --> 20:13.280
so run out to the tool shed
and shave 3/8ths of an inch
off the bottom of your foot.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.517
You let that woman walk
unevenly all over you.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.390
It's time you told
her the truth.

20:23.423 --> 20:26.393
I can't!
You can't because you're weak.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.995
Oh, yeah? Does this
feel weak to you?

20:29.028 --> 20:31.464
Unh!

20:35.034 --> 20:36.969
You know what, Rosie,
maybe you're right.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.005
Maybe I should tell her.

20:39.038 --> 20:43.310
[childishly]
Ohh, what would I do
without my little Ro-Ro!

20:45.578 --> 20:48.281
I've gotta stop falling in love
with straight women.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.555
What are you all
looking at?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.557
Not used to seeing
somebody like me

20:57.590 --> 20:59.326
without a two-headed chicken

20:59.359 --> 21:01.961
and boy
with lobster hands nearby?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.966
It's just you
and me, honey.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.602
Oh! In that case,
you wanna get a pizza

21:09.636 --> 21:10.970
and watch Family Guy?

21:13.473 --> 21:15.875
Sit down, Gin.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.578
I need to talk to you
about your accident.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.581
Karen, you know I don't
like to talk about that.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.551
I know, honey, but--

21:24.584 --> 21:26.386
this is important.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.287
It wasn't an accident.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.591
I loosened that floorboard

21:31.624 --> 21:33.593
underneath the Twister game,

21:33.626 --> 21:36.095
because I was
jealous of you.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.865
You were always
Daddy's favorite.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.400
He never even noticed me.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.035
He was always taking you
to dance lessons

21:43.069 --> 21:45.004
and singing lessons.

21:45.037 --> 21:48.908
I had to stay home with Mom
and learn how to bartend.

21:50.577 --> 21:52.945
Oh, Ginny.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.915
Can you ever forgive me
for what I did to you?

21:57.116 --> 22:00.987
I can, because I also
have a confession to make.

22:02.522 --> 22:06.025
You didn't cause my accident.

22:06.058 --> 22:10.363
Karen, I didn't fall
on right foot red.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.936
I fell on left hand green.

22:18.705 --> 22:19.672
What?

22:19.706 --> 22:21.508
That's right.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.577
I loosened that floorboard
so you' fall through.

22:24.611 --> 22:27.447
I just got
so caught up in the game,

22:27.480 --> 22:28.515
I forgot.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.718
Oh, it's easy
to get caught up.

22:31.751 --> 22:35.922
You spin the spinner
and call your spot.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.725
Twister will
tie you up in a knot.

22:42.094 --> 22:45.732
And it's the perfect way
to get rid of the sister that...

22:45.765 --> 22:47.667
I was always jealous of.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.936
You were popular

22:49.969 --> 22:52.405
and easygoing,

22:52.439 --> 22:54.941
and all the boys
loved you.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.108
Well, honey, if--

22:56.142 --> 22:58.177
if they did like me
more than you,

22:58.210 --> 23:01.080
it was only because
I was kind and I listened

23:01.113 --> 23:03.783
and I let them bang me
under the bleachers

23:03.816 --> 23:06.085
while their friends watched.

23:10.022 --> 23:14.093
See, I always
freeze up in a crowd.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.030
So all these years,

23:18.064 --> 23:19.599
we've both felt bad
for nothing.

23:19.632 --> 23:20.967
Mmm.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.702
And now we can be
closer than ever.

23:22.735 --> 23:23.736
Oh, I'd like that.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.477
Will?
Will?!

23:30.510 --> 23:31.711
What, what is it?
Are you okay?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.813
You're never gonna believe
what just happened.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.115
I was on my way home
from Dunkin' Donuts.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.619
And I stopped into McDonalds,
because I was starving.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.053
And then I ran into--

23:41.087 --> 23:43.155
A Jenny Craig?

23:43.189 --> 23:46.759
The guy who was Leo's best man
at our wedding, remember?

23:46.793 --> 23:49.028
You said he was gonna
come out in two years.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.030
You were wrong, he went home
with Jack that night?

23:51.063 --> 23:52.231
Anyway,

23:52.264 --> 23:56.669
he told me that Leo called off
his engagement with Kate.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.771
Huh.

23:58.805 --> 24:01.508
No "huh."

24:01.541 --> 24:03.610
Great!

24:03.643 --> 24:06.112
Now Leo--
Now Leo is single,

24:06.145 --> 24:08.815
and I know
how to find him.

24:08.848 --> 24:09.849
What--what--

24:09.882 --> 24:11.217
So have you called him yet?

24:11.250 --> 24:12.218
Oh, no, no, no.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.553
I don't want to call him.

24:13.586 --> 24:14.721
I mean, at this point,
I just--

24:14.754 --> 24:16.122
I don't think
that this is something

24:16.155 --> 24:17.524
that I want to explain
over the phone.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.792
So I'm just going to get on

24:19.826 --> 24:21.594
the first flight to Rome.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.530
Rome?

24:23.563 --> 24:24.831
Oh, yeah.
Hello.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.499
That's where he's living now.

24:26.533 --> 24:30.169
He got some sort of a research
job at a hospital there.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.838
Wait, wait, wait.
You're going to Rome?

24:31.871 --> 24:33.573
Is it even safe
for you to fly?

24:33.606 --> 24:34.340
Oh yeah, yeah.
It's--

24:34.373 --> 24:37.109
I'm good for a--
a few more weeks.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.645
Well, you're not going
to be there for weeks.

24:38.678 --> 24:39.779
Probably not.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.648
Probably not?

24:41.681 --> 24:44.751
Well, I guess it, uh, depends
on how it goes with Leo.

24:44.784 --> 24:47.720
Wait.
So--so--

24:47.754 --> 24:50.757
You find out Leo
canceled his wedding,

24:50.790 --> 24:52.825
and you're on a plane
to Rome within minutes?

24:52.859 --> 24:54.827
And--and you may be there
for a while?

24:54.861 --> 24:56.128
Is that
what you're telling me?

24:56.162 --> 24:57.530
I know it sounds crazy.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.232
But I know that he is still
in love with me.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.868
Why else would he have
called off his wedding?

25:01.901 --> 25:03.703
I gotta go.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.237
I've got to find out
for sure.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.239
Beyond that, I don't know
what's going to happen.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.308
Well, uh,
how about this?

25:09.341 --> 25:11.143
You go tell Leo
you're pregnant,

25:11.177 --> 25:12.679
then you fly
back to New York,

25:12.712 --> 25:14.581
where we raise
this baby together.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.783
Like we planned.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.553
What are you doing?
Why--

25:20.587 --> 25:21.854
Why are you being like this?

25:21.888 --> 25:24.190
I'm sorry,
I'm just trying to catch up.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.925
'Cause suddenly
you're living in Rome

25:25.958 --> 25:27.560
with Leo and our baby.

25:27.594 --> 25:29.629
Our baby?

25:29.662 --> 25:30.830
Well--yeah.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.633
The one you're naming
after my father. Remember?

25:33.666 --> 25:34.801
Isn't--isn't that
the way you told me

25:34.834 --> 25:36.669
to think about this child?

25:36.703 --> 25:39.772
I know I have,
but, I mean, it's--

25:39.806 --> 25:41.774
I know, it's just that Leo,
the guy who cheated on you,

25:41.808 --> 25:43.576
is suddenly available,

25:43.610 --> 25:44.911
and you're going to go
running after him

25:44.944 --> 25:46.145
like some pathetic schoolgirl.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.347
Do you have any idea

25:48.380 --> 25:50.583
what I have sacrificed
for you and this baby?

25:50.617 --> 25:53.152
Sacrificed?
What--what do you mean?

25:53.185 --> 25:54.654
I just broke up with Vince!

25:54.687 --> 25:56.623
What?!

25:56.656 --> 26:00.292
Oh, my God.
Why?

26:00.326 --> 26:03.229
Because I wouldn't put him
before my commitment to you.

26:03.262 --> 26:04.731
Hey, it was the hardest thing
I've ever done,

26:04.764 --> 26:06.733
but I did it for you!

26:06.766 --> 26:07.767
Well, who asked you to?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.802
Excuse me?

26:09.836 --> 26:12.271
Will, don't we--

26:12.304 --> 26:14.607
Don't we want each other
to be happy?

26:14.641 --> 26:16.943
I mean, if--
if Vince makes you happy,

26:16.976 --> 26:18.811
you never should have
left him.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.947
And if I have
a possibility

26:20.980 --> 26:21.981
of being happy with Leo,

26:22.014 --> 26:23.249
you should want that for me,

26:23.282 --> 26:24.951
instead of making me
feel guilty

26:24.984 --> 26:26.385
about wanting a relationship

26:26.418 --> 26:28.387
with the real father
of my child.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.923
Well, tell me this, Grace.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.993
If--if Leo canceled
his wedding for you,

26:34.026 --> 26:35.127
why hasn't he called?

26:38.665 --> 26:41.968
God, I cannot believe you are
doing this to me again!

26:42.001 --> 26:43.703
We're going to have
a baby together,

26:43.736 --> 26:45.738
then Leo shows up,
and I'm out of the picture.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.207
You know what, an hour ago,
I put you first.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.376
Why was I stupid enough
to think

26:50.409 --> 26:52.011
that you would ever
do the same for me?

26:52.044 --> 26:54.180
Will, I am not choosing
between the two of you.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.748
Look, okay.
Okay, listen.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.284
We just need to breathe
and just calm down here, okay?

26:58.317 --> 26:59.852
Nothing has even happened.

26:59.886 --> 27:03.790
Let's just...let's
just start over, okay?

27:03.823 --> 27:04.791
Okay.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.760
Answer me this.

27:07.794 --> 27:11.430
If you're in Rome,
raising this baby with Leo,

27:11.463 --> 27:13.833
where am I?

27:19.338 --> 27:20.873
I don't know.
