01:52.863 --> 01:56.657
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheree

01:56.742 --> 02:00.953
A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

02:01.038 --> 02:04.665
Chim chiminy chim chiminy
Chim chim cheroo

02:04.750 --> 02:08.919
Good luck will rub off
when he shakes hands with you

02:09.003 --> 02:14.258
Chim chiminy chim chim cheree
Chim cheroo

03:23.871 --> 03:26.330
All right, ladies and gents.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.958
Comical poems
suitable for the occasion,

03:29.042 --> 03:32.753
extemporised and thought up
before your very eyes.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.006
All right, here we go.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.885
(SINGING) Room here for everyone
Gather around

03:38.969 --> 03:41.262
The constable's responstable.

03:41.346 --> 03:42.638
Now, how does that sound?

03:42.723 --> 03:43.764
Hmm...

03:47.811 --> 03:51.647
Hello, Miss Lark
I got one for you

03:52.232 --> 03:55.651
Miss Lark likes to walk in the park...

03:55.736 --> 03:57.236
- Grrrr.
...with Andrew!

03:57.446 --> 03:58.779
Arf! Arf!

03:58.864 --> 04:02.617
- Hello, Andrew.
- Arf! Arf! Grrrr! Grrrr!

04:03.368 --> 04:04.911
Ah, Mrs Cory

04:04.995 --> 04:07.997
A story for you

04:08.081 --> 04:10.416
Your daughters were shorter than you,

04:10.500 --> 04:13.044
but they grew.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.178
Dear Miss Persimmon...

04:24.097 --> 04:25.556
Yes?

04:27.517 --> 04:29.185
Wind's in the east

04:30.228 --> 04:32.897
Mist comin' in

04:32.981 --> 04:35.608
Like something is brewin'

04:35.692 --> 04:38.611
About to begin

04:39.696 --> 04:44.033
Can't put me finger
on what lies in store

04:45.118 --> 04:47.828
But I feel what's to happen

04:47.913 --> 04:50.289
All happened before

04:50.999 --> 04:52.375
Arf! Arf! Grrrr!

04:53.210 --> 04:55.586
I'm sorry. Where was I?

05:20.946 --> 05:24.407
Thank you, one and all,
for your kind support.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.955
Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.709
Crikey.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.419
Bless you, guv.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.130
Generosity itself, that's what you are.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.798
No charge.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.262
Oh, it's you. Hello.

05:48.598 --> 05:52.101
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.978
All right. Come with me.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.940
This here's Cherry Tree Lane.

05:59.276 --> 06:02.570
Nice little spot, you might say.

06:02.654 --> 06:05.573
Number 17 is just down a bit.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.871
Now this imposing edifice
what first greets the eye

06:11.955 --> 06:14.373
is the home of Admiral Boom,

06:14.458 --> 06:16.500
late of His Majesty's navy.

06:16.585 --> 06:21.630
Likes his house shipshape
and Bristol fashion at all times.

06:22.674 --> 06:26.802
(BLOWS BOS'N'S WHISTLE)

06:28.013 --> 06:31.599
- Time gun ready?
- Ready and charged, sir.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.727
- Three minutes and six seconds.
- Aye, aye, sir.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.898
What he's famous for is punctuality.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.233
The whole world
takes its time from Greenwich,

06:41.318 --> 06:45.362
but Greenwich
takes its time from Admiral Boom.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.198
What cheer, Admiral?

06:47.282 --> 06:50.451
Good afternoon! Where are you bound?

06:50.535 --> 06:53.996
Some parties want to see number 17.

06:54.081 --> 06:57.041
- Enter that in the log.
- Aye, aye, sir.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.251
Some advice, young man.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.254
Storm signals are up at 17.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.590
Heavy weather brewing there.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.176
Thank you, sir. I'll keep an eye skinned.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.930
Here we are.

07:11.014 --> 07:15.559
Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane,
residence of George Banks, esquire.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.103
(SHOUTING)

07:17.187 --> 07:20.439
Hello, hello, hello. The admiral's right.

07:20.524 --> 07:24.693
Heavy weather brewing at number 17,
and no mistake.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.904
Leave her alone!

07:26.988 --> 07:29.448
Don't you be trying to stop
the wretched creature!

07:29.533 --> 07:31.617
Let her go and good riddance.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.786
I never liked her from the moment
she set foot in the door.

07:33.870 --> 07:38.833
But who'll get stuck with the children?
Me, that's who!

07:38.917 --> 07:41.127
Her and her high and mighty ways.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.337
And that face of her
that would stop a coal barge, it would.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.547
Indeed, Mrs Brill!

07:44.631 --> 07:46.632
I wouldn't stay in this house
another minute

07:46.716 --> 07:49.301
for all the jewels in Christendom.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.971
No, Katie Nanna, don't go!

07:52.055 --> 07:53.430
Stand away from that door!

07:53.515 --> 07:56.058
What'll I tell the master
about the children?

07:56.184 --> 07:57.643
It's no concern of mine.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.896
Those beasts ran away from me.

08:00.981 --> 08:06.277
They must be somewhere.
Did you look around the zoo?

08:06.361 --> 08:09.321
You think the lion got them?

08:09.406 --> 08:11.991
They're fond of
hanging around the cage.

08:12.075 --> 08:13.993
I've said my say.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.871
I've done with this house forever.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.664
Hip, hip, hooray!

08:18.748 --> 08:21.709
Don't stumble on the way out.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.253
No, no, Katie Nanna!

08:24.337 --> 08:26.046
(SINGING)

08:26.131 --> 08:28.716
Mrs Banks. She's home.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.760
(SINGING)
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

08:31.845 --> 08:35.306
And we'll sing in grateful chorus
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

08:35.432 --> 08:37.433
Good evening, Katie Nanna and Ellen.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.684
The meeting was glorious!

08:39.769 --> 08:44.023
Mrs Whitbourne-Allen chained herself
to the prime minister's carriage.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.442
You should have been there!

08:46.526 --> 08:49.278
And Mrs Ainslie
was carried off to prison.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.488
Singing and scattering pamphlets
all the way!

08:51.573 --> 08:54.533
Madam, I've always given my best...

08:54.618 --> 08:56.535
Thank you, Katie Nanna.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.621
I knew you were one of us.

08:59.623 --> 09:03.542
We're clearly soldiers in petticoats

09:03.627 --> 09:07.588
And dauntless crusaders
for women's votes

09:07.672 --> 09:11.550
Though we adore men individually

09:11.635 --> 09:16.222
We agree that as a group
they're rather stupid

09:16.306 --> 09:17.306
Mrs Banks...

09:17.390 --> 09:21.060
Cast off the shackles of yesterday

09:21.144 --> 09:24.730
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

09:24.814 --> 09:28.275
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

09:28.360 --> 09:32.571
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

09:32.656 --> 09:35.824
"Well done, Sister Suffragette"

09:35.909 --> 09:38.744
I don't wish to offend, but...

09:38.828 --> 09:42.998
From Kensington to Billingsgate
One hears the restless cries

09:43.083 --> 09:46.961
From every corner of the land
Womankind, arise

09:47.045 --> 09:50.589
Political equality
and equal rights with men

09:50.674 --> 09:55.261
Take heart, for Mrs Pankhurst
has been clapped in irons again

09:55.345 --> 10:00.057
No more the meek
and mild subservients we

10:01.643 --> 10:06.188
We're fighting for our rights militantly

10:06.273 --> 10:07.731
Never you fear

10:07.816 --> 10:10.943
If I may have a word...

10:11.027 --> 10:15.864
So cast off the shackles of yesterday

10:15.949 --> 10:19.451
Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

10:19.536 --> 10:23.956
Our daughter's daughters will adore us

10:24.040 --> 10:28.627
And they'll sing in grateful chorus

10:28.712 --> 10:29.920
"Well done"

10:30.005 --> 10:30.963
Mrs Banks!

10:31.047 --> 10:33.090
"Well done"

10:33.174 --> 10:35.092
Mrs Banks!

10:35.176 --> 10:36.969
What is it, Katie Nanna?

10:37.053 --> 10:40.472
I have something to say to you.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.016
Where are the children?

10:42.100 --> 10:46.228
The children, to be precise,
are not here.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.771
They've disappeared again.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.399
That's really careless of you.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.401
That's the third time this week.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.028
The fourth, madam.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.488
I've had my fill.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.324
I'm not one to speak ill of the children.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.367
When do you expect them home?

11:00.452 --> 11:03.912
I couldn't say.
If you'd compute my wages...

11:03.997 --> 11:07.124
Oh, gracious! You're not leaving?

11:07.208 --> 11:08.834
What will Mr Banks say?

11:08.918 --> 11:12.338
He'll be cross
when he finds the children missing.

11:12.422 --> 11:17.176
Put these away.
The cause infuriates Mr Banks.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.888
I beseech you, please reconsider.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.348
Think of the children.

11:22.432 --> 11:26.352
Think of Mr Banks.
He was just getting used to you.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.065
Posts, everyone!

11:37.989 --> 11:41.658
4, 3, 2, 1...

11:41.743 --> 11:42.993
Fire!

11:55.590 --> 11:59.885
- I do beseech you...
- My wages, if you please.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.891
Bit early tonight, Admiral?

12:05.975 --> 12:09.103
Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.480
How's the world of finance?

12:11.564 --> 12:12.689
Never better.

12:12.774 --> 12:15.984
Money's sound,
credit rates are moving up,

12:16.069 --> 12:19.905
- and the pound is admired everywhere.
- Good.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.407
How about you?

12:21.491 --> 12:24.159
Bit chancy, I'd say.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.703
The wind's up. The glass is falling.

12:26.788 --> 12:29.540
- Don't like it.
- Good. Good, good.

12:29.624 --> 12:34.253
Banks, you're steering into
a nasty piece of weather.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.337
Banks!

12:35.839 --> 12:37.339
Do you hear me?

12:39.676 --> 12:43.429
Hello, Katie Nanna.
That must be heavy. Allow me.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.349
Hmph!

12:47.851 --> 12:49.977
What a very pretty hat.

12:57.026 --> 13:00.946
(SINGING)
I feel a surge of deep satisfaction

13:01.030 --> 13:04.158
Much as a king astride his noble steed

13:04.242 --> 13:05.242
Thank you.

13:05.326 --> 13:09.580
When I return from daily strife
to hearth and wife

13:09.664 --> 13:12.499
How pleasant is the life I lead

13:12.584 --> 13:14.877
- Dear, the children...
- Yes, yes, yes.

13:14.961 --> 13:18.630
I run my home precisely on schedule

13:18.715 --> 13:22.593
At 6:01, I march through my door

13:22.677 --> 13:26.805
My slippers, sherry, and pipe
are due at 6:02

13:26.890 --> 13:29.600
Consistent is the life I lead

13:29.684 --> 13:30.893
George, they're missing.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.644
Splendid, splendid.

13:32.729 --> 13:36.356
It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

13:36.441 --> 13:40.194
King Edward's on the throne
It's the age of men

13:40.278 --> 13:44.198
I'm the lord of my castle
The sovereign, the liege

13:44.282 --> 13:47.743
I treat my subjects
servants, children, wife

13:47.827 --> 13:50.162
With a firm, but gentle hand
Noblesse oblige

13:50.246 --> 13:55.334
It's 6:03, and the heirs to my dominion
are scrubbed and tubbed

13:55.418 --> 13:57.920
And adequately fed

13:58.004 --> 14:02.132
And so I'll pat them on the head
and send them off to bed

14:02.217 --> 14:07.721
Ah, lordly is the life I lead

14:08.806 --> 14:10.641
Winifred, where are the children?

14:11.601 --> 14:12.935
They're not here, dear.

14:14.145 --> 14:17.356
Of course they're here.
Where else would they be?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.942
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

14:20.026 --> 14:23.737
They're missing.
Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.698
Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.788
The police station. Quickly, please.

14:32.872 --> 14:36.208
We needn't bother the police.
The fact is...

14:36.292 --> 14:38.377
Facts cloud the issue.

14:38.461 --> 14:42.548
One fact alone is clear.
Katie Nanna's faltered.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.884
She's disappointed us.
I shall bring her to book...

14:46.761 --> 14:47.886
Oh.

14:47.971 --> 14:52.891
- She's left us, hasn't she?
- Yes, only just.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.644
- George Banks here.
- (DOORBELL RINGS)

14:56.145 --> 14:59.565
17 Cherry Tree Lane.
It's a matter of some urgency.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.068
Please send a policeman.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.404
The policeman's here, George.

15:05.488 --> 15:09.032
What? Oh. Very prompt.
Wonderful service.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.743
Thank you so much. Good night.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.996
Come in, constable.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.792
While on duty across the park,
I noted some stray valuables.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.295
- I believe they're yours.
- Valuables?

15:22.171 --> 15:23.672
Come along now.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.759
Jane.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.261
Michael.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.013
Winifred, don't be emotional.

15:31.097 --> 15:35.392
I wouldn't be too hard on them, sir.
They've had a long, weary walk today.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.894
Children, come here at once.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.859
Well?

15:43.943 --> 15:47.946
- Sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father.
- It was windy...

15:48.031 --> 15:50.324
And the kite was too strong.

15:50.408 --> 15:54.286
The kite ran away, sir, not the children.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.789
Thank you. I'll manage this.

15:57.874 --> 16:01.793
It wasn't a good kite.
We made it ourselves.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.171
Perhaps if you helped us...

16:04.255 --> 16:07.924
That's the ticket.
Kites are skittish things.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.551
Only last week...

16:09.636 --> 16:12.137
I'm very grateful to you, constable.

16:12.221 --> 16:16.600
The cook will
find you a plate of something.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.936
I shall now return to my duties.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.271
Thank you, constable.

16:22.273 --> 16:26.318
Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.945
"Cook will find something."

16:31.991 --> 16:35.035
I'm awfully sorry about this, George.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.329
You'll want to discuss it.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.706
I would, indeed.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.084
Ellen, take the children upstairs.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.752
Yes, sir.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.838
I knew it.

16:46.923 --> 16:50.550
Who bears the brunt of everything?

16:50.635 --> 16:52.052
Me, that's who.

16:52.136 --> 16:55.931
They don't want
an honest working girl here.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.600
They need a ruddy zoo keeper.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.560
Sorry.

17:00.645 --> 17:04.772
When I chose Katie Nanna,
I thought she'd be firm.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.900
She looked solemn, cross.

17:06.983 --> 17:10.529
Never confuse efficiency
with a liver complaint.

17:10.613 --> 17:12.364
I'll do better next time.

17:12.448 --> 17:18.119
Next time? You've engaged six nannies.
They've all been unqualified disasters.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.496
I quite agree.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.374
Choosing a nanny is a delicate task,

17:22.458 --> 17:27.753
requiring insight, balanced judgement,
and an ability to read character.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.339
Under the circumstances,

17:29.424 --> 17:34.469
it might be apropos
to select the next person myself.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.846
Would you, George?

17:35.930 --> 17:39.141
I'll do this properly.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.059
I'll advertise in The Times.

17:41.144 --> 17:43.395
- Take this down, please.
- Yes, of course.

17:43.479 --> 17:46.356
Wanted... No, required...

17:46.441 --> 17:47.607
Nanny.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.652
Firm, respectable, no-nonsense.

17:51.696 --> 17:55.490
(SINGING)
A British nanny must be a general

17:55.575 --> 17:59.244
The future empire lies within her hands

17:59.328 --> 18:03.540
And so the person that we need
to mould the breed

18:03.624 --> 18:06.376
It is a nanny who can give commands

18:06.461 --> 18:08.920
- Getting this, Winifred?
- Yes, every word.

18:09.005 --> 18:12.591
A British bank is run with precision

18:12.675 --> 18:16.511
A British home requires nothing less

18:16.596 --> 18:21.433
Tradition, discipline, and rules
must be the tools

18:21.517 --> 18:26.021
Without them
disorder, catastrophe, anarchy

18:26.105 --> 18:28.565
In short, you have a ghastly mess

18:29.859 --> 18:34.237
Splendid, George. Inspirational.
The Times will be so pleased.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.698
- Father.
- Yes?

18:37.575 --> 18:41.787
We've discussed everything,
and we're very sorry about today.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.622
I should think so.

18:43.706 --> 18:46.875
- It was wrong.
- Indeed.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.127
We'll cooperate with the new nanny.

18:49.212 --> 18:52.339
I'll be glad for your help.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.383
That's why we wrote this advertisement.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.510

18:56.594 --> 18:57.886
The new nanny.

Oh, very well.

two adorable children."

19:08.689 --> 19:11.316

I'll take the report, Mr Binnacle.

Wind's coming from a new quarter.

So it is.

- Sir.

Something taking place

There's a queue of nannies outside.
Shall I show them in?

Yes, sir.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.160

22:50.244 --> 22:52.871
I dislike being hurried into things.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.622
I don't understand.

Yes, of course.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.328
You brought your references?

24:57.413 --> 24:59.581
I never give references.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.666
I believe it very old-fashioned.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.627
We'll see about that then.

Item three, "Play games, all sorts."

That paper. I thought that I...

25:40.497 --> 25:43.041
You are George Banks?

25:43.125 --> 25:45.335

George Banks.

25:47.922 --> 25:48.963
Very well, then.

threw it in the...

I hope not.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.477

- The reference is obscure.
- Obscure.

We must be clear on that.

26:08.192 --> 26:11.861
- I require every second Tuesday off.
- Every Tuesday.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.868
Perhaps a trial period would be wise.

26:25.501 --> 26:29.587
Hmm... I'll give you one week.
I'll know by then.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.842

27:03.163 --> 27:05.498
- George?
- Aah!

27:05.582 --> 27:08.668
I thought you were
interviewing nannies.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.461
I was, I was.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.046
You've selected one already?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.798
Yes, it's done.

27:13.882 --> 27:17.635
- Where is she?
- In the nursery.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.179
- I put her to work straight-away.
- How clever.

27:20.264 --> 27:23.141
I'd have muddled everything.

27:23.225 --> 27:27.520
Is she everything
that we hoped she'd be?

27:27.604 --> 27:31.649
It all happened rather quickly.
I mean, I... I, uh...

27:31.734 --> 27:34.027
Will she be firm and give commands?

27:34.111 --> 27:37.030
Will she mould our young breed?

27:38.073 --> 27:40.199
Winifred, I think she will.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.869
I think she will!

27:42.953 --> 27:46.706
In that case, perhaps
Ellen should dismiss the others.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.499
The others?

27:48.584 --> 27:51.502
- Ellen!
- Yes, sir?

27:51.587 --> 27:54.672
Tell the others
the position's been filled.

27:54.757 --> 27:58.009
- The others, sir?
- Yes, the others.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.930
How many nannies
does this house need?

28:05.517 --> 28:08.478
The position has been filled.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.779
I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.114
Rather like a bear pit.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.784
- That's a funny bag.
- Carpet.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.161
- To carry carpets?
- No, made of.

It's not exactly Buckingham Palace...

28:37.591 --> 28:39.217
Still, it's clean.

28:40.803 --> 28:43.513
Yes, it will be quite suitable.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.306
Just needs a touch here and there.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.394
First things first.

28:49.478 --> 28:53.815
The place to hang a hat
is on a hat stand.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.621
Oh!

29:08.705 --> 29:10.915
This will never do.

29:16.630 --> 29:20.007
I much prefer
seeing all of my face at once.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.970
But there was nothing in it.

29:24.054 --> 29:28.474
Never judge things
by their appearance, even carpetbags.

29:28.559 --> 29:29.851
I never do.

29:35.524 --> 29:38.776
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever."

29:43.574 --> 29:46.868
Hmm... A little more light perhaps.

29:57.671 --> 30:00.756
We'd better watch this one.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.634
- She's tricky.
- She's wonderful.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.386
Much better.

30:07.181 --> 30:09.265
Now, let me see.

30:14.730 --> 30:19.442
That's funny. I always carry it.
It must be here somewhere.

30:19.526 --> 30:21.319
- What?
- My tape measure.

30:21.403 --> 30:24.614
- What for?
- To see how you measure up.

30:30.162 --> 30:33.748
That's the funniest thing I ever saw.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.250
Ah ha ha ha. Here it is.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.418
Good.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.171
Come along, then. Quickly.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.424

- I am not.
- See for yourself.

- "Extremely stubborn and susips..."
- Suspicious.

did you not request games?

31:37.271 --> 31:38.980
Yes.

31:51.535 --> 31:52.618
Shall we begin?

31:52.703 --> 31:55.580
It is a game, isn't it?

31:55.664 --> 31:58.416
Depends on your viewpoint.

You see, in every job that must be done,
there is an element of fun.

32:03.672 --> 32:07.842
You find the fun,
and snap, the job's a game.

spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

The medicine go down
Medicine go down

Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

32:58.602 --> 33:00.853
He knows a song

33:00.937 --> 33:06.484
Will move the job along

33:10.405 --> 33:12.323
(WHISTLING)

33:13.867 --> 33:18.913
For a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

33:18.997 --> 33:23.125
The medicine go down
Medicine go down

33:23.210 --> 33:28.005
Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down

33:28.090 --> 33:31.926
In a most delightful way

33:40.102 --> 33:41.936
(WHISTLING)

33:42.854 --> 34:26.647

34:33.196 --> 34:37.867
The honeybees that fetch the nectar
from the flowers to the comb

34:37.951 --> 34:41.495
Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro

34:41.580 --> 34:45.875
Because they take a little nip
from every flower that they sip

34:45.958 --> 34:49.085
And hence

34:49.170 --> 34:51.422
They find

34:51.505 --> 34:56.635
Their task is not a grind
Their task is not a grind

34:57.929 --> 35:04.018
Aaah

35:05.520 --> 35:06.812
Cheeky.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.025
Don't be all day.

35:23.997 --> 35:25.039
(SNAP)

35:39.805 --> 35:42.348
Let me out! Let me out!

35:53.610 --> 35:55.694
Let me out!

35:56.738 --> 35:58.030
Well...

36:00.116 --> 36:01.492
Thank you now.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.912
When you've quite finished!

36:05.956 --> 36:07.164
Thank you.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.670
That's quite sufficient.

36:12.754 --> 36:15.214
Hats and coats, please.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.007
It's time for our outing.

36:17.092 --> 36:20.678
Let's tidy up the nursery again.

36:20.762 --> 36:23.013
Enough's as good as a feast.

36:23.098 --> 36:26.475
You're not as well turned out as I'd like.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.853
Still, there's time.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.063
Spit spot.

36:31.147 --> 36:32.940
And off we go!

I does what I likes and I likes...

37:27.662 --> 37:29.830
What I do

37:30.916 --> 37:33.000
Hello, art lovers.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.919
Today I'm a screever

37:35.003 --> 37:38.964
And as you can see
A screever's an artist

37:40.842 --> 37:43.093
Of highest degree

37:43.178 --> 37:47.514
And it's all me own work
from me own memory

37:48.683 --> 37:53.020
Not Royal Academy.
Still, they're not bad, are they?

37:53.104 --> 37:57.191
Chim chiminy chim chiminy

37:57.275 --> 38:01.236
I draws what I likes
and I likes what I drew

38:04.240 --> 38:08.035
No remuneration do I ask of you

38:08.119 --> 38:11.789
But me cap would be glad
of a copper or two

38:11.873 --> 38:16.335
Me cap would be glad
of a copper or two

38:24.302 --> 38:25.469
Wait!

38:25.553 --> 38:27.054
Don't move.

38:27.138 --> 38:30.099
Don't move a muscle.

38:30.183 --> 38:32.893
Stay right where you are.

38:33.728 --> 38:37.815
I'd know that silhouette anywhere.

38:37.899 --> 38:41.568
- Mary Poppins!
- Hello, Bert.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.904
You know Jane and Michael.

38:43.989 --> 38:47.574
Well, I've seen them here and about.
Chasing a kite last time, weren't it?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.827
We're going to the park.

38:50.704 --> 38:52.496
To the park?

38:52.580 --> 38:55.165
Not if I know Mary Poppins.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.459
Other nannies go to the park.

38:57.544 --> 39:00.629
When you're with Mary Poppins,

39:00.714 --> 39:03.966
quick as you can say,
"Bob's your uncle,"

39:04.050 --> 39:06.844
the most unusual things happen.

39:06.928 --> 39:09.388
What are you talking about?

39:09.931 --> 39:11.682
It's not my place to say,

39:11.766 --> 39:16.020
but she probably has in mind
a jolly holiday.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.938
Something along these lines.

39:21.151 --> 39:24.403
That's always good. Here we go.

39:26.114 --> 39:28.824

39:35.957 --> 39:39.293
How about a lovely circus?
Lions and tigers.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.544
World famous artistes

39:40.628 --> 39:45.257
performing death-defying feats
of dexterity and skill.

39:45.800 --> 40:07.404
Ta-da!

40:12.035 --> 40:16.038
Oh, that's lovely.
I'd much rather go there.

40:16.122 --> 40:21.752
A typical English countryside
done by a loving hand.

40:21.836 --> 40:28.050
Though you can't see it, there's
a little country fair down that road.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.511
I don't see any road.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.638
What? No road?

40:35.141 --> 40:39.103
Just wants a bit of something here

40:41.272 --> 40:44.483
and a bit of something there.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.485
There.

40:46.569 --> 40:50.322
A country road
suitable for travel and high adventure.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.533
May we go, Mary Poppins, please?

40:52.617 --> 40:56.286
Don't you think it's lovely,
Mary Poppins?

40:56.371 --> 40:58.914
Now's the time. No one's looking.

40:58.998 --> 41:01.625
Oh, please. Please.

41:01.709 --> 41:05.003
I have no intention of making
a spectacle of myself.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.090
All right. I'll do it myself.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.050
Do what?

41:10.135 --> 41:11.468
Bit of magic.

41:11.553 --> 41:13.345
- Magic?
- It's easy.

41:13.429 --> 41:14.638
Let's see.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.640
You think.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.518
You wink.

41:19.602 --> 41:22.938
You do a double blink.

41:23.064 --> 41:26.108
You close your eyes and jump.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.365
Is something supposed to happen?

41:33.449 --> 41:35.868
Bert, what utter nonsense.

41:36.077 --> 41:36.743
Oh.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.623
Why do you complicate things?

41:41.708 --> 41:43.959
Give me your hand, Michael.
Don't slouch.

41:44.043 --> 41:45.752
1, 2...

42:02.228 --> 42:05.981
Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

42:06.065 --> 42:10.194
- Do you really think so?
- Cross my heart, you do.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.696
You look fine, too, Bert.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.990
Isn't there a fair?

42:15.074 --> 42:19.244
Down the road and behind the hill.

42:19.329 --> 42:21.705
I hear the merry-go-round.

42:21.789 --> 42:24.833
- Tell them hello.
- Don't smudge the drawing.

42:29.714 --> 42:33.967
(SINGING) Ain't it a glorious day
Right as a mornin' in May

42:34.052 --> 42:37.137
I feel like I could fly

42:37.263 --> 42:40.557
Now, Bert, none of your larking about.

42:40.642 --> 42:45.062
Have you ever seen
the grass so green

42:45.146 --> 42:48.440
Or a bluer sky

42:51.736 --> 42:55.739
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

42:55.823 --> 42:58.408
Mary makes your heart so light

42:58.493 --> 43:00.202
You haven't changed.

43:00.286 --> 43:04.206
When the day is grey and ordinary

43:04.290 --> 43:07.417
Mary makes the sun shine bright

43:07.502 --> 43:08.585
Oh, honestly.

43:08.670 --> 43:12.506
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her

43:13.258 --> 43:17.469
The daffodils are smiling at the dove

43:17.553 --> 43:21.807
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand

43:21.891 --> 43:26.270
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

43:28.856 --> 43:30.732
You are light-headed.

43:30.817 --> 43:34.861
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

43:34.946 --> 43:38.198
No wonder that it's Mary that we love

43:52.588 --> 43:57.134
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

43:57.218 --> 44:01.221
Mary makes your heart so light

44:01.347 --> 44:05.642
When the day is grey and ordinary

44:05.727 --> 44:09.813
Mary makes the sun shine bright

44:09.897 --> 44:14.484
Oh, happiness is bloomin'
all around her

44:14.569 --> 44:18.405
The daffodils are smiling
at the dove, oink, oink

44:18.489 --> 44:23.160
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand

44:23.244 --> 44:27.372
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

44:30.001 --> 44:34.004
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

44:34.088 --> 44:37.883
No wonder that it's Mary that we love

46:15.356 --> 46:16.481
Thank you.

46:16.566 --> 46:19.025
Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

46:24.532 --> 46:28.702
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

46:29.245 --> 46:31.955
Gentlemen like you are few

46:32.039 --> 46:33.457
A vanishing breed.

46:33.541 --> 46:37.961
Though you're just
a diamond in the rough, Bert

46:38.045 --> 46:40.839
Underneath your blood is blue

46:40.923 --> 46:42.215
Common knowledge.

46:42.300 --> 46:46.470
You'd never think
of pressing your advantage

46:46.554 --> 46:50.807
Forbearance
is the hallmark of your creed

46:50.892 --> 46:55.228
A lady needn't fear
when you are near

46:55.313 --> 46:59.566
Your sweet gentility is crystal clear

46:59.650 --> 47:03.987
Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

47:04.071 --> 47:08.575
A jolly, jolly holiday with you

47:21.506 --> 47:23.173
Waiter! Waiter?

47:43.694 --> 47:45.779
Now then, what would be nice?

47:45.863 --> 47:47.697
We'll start with raspberry ice

47:47.782 --> 47:51.701
And then some cakes and tea

47:52.495 --> 47:54.287
Order what you will

47:54.372 --> 47:56.498
There'll be no bill

47:56.582 --> 47:59.417
It's complimentary

47:59.502 --> 48:00.710
You're very kind.

48:00.795 --> 48:03.922
Anything for you, Mary Poppins.

48:04.006 --> 48:05.840
You're our favourite person.

48:05.925 --> 48:07.467
Right you are.

48:07.552 --> 48:08.843
It's true that...

48:08.928 --> 48:10.637
Mavis and Sybil
have ways that are winning

48:10.721 --> 48:12.472
And Prudence and Gwendolyn
set your heart spinnin'

48:12.557 --> 48:14.057
Phoebe's delightful
Maude is disarming

48:14.141 --> 48:15.392
Felicia, Janice and Lydia

48:15.476 --> 48:17.769
Charming!
Cynthia's dashing, Vivian's sweet

48:17.853 --> 48:19.396
Stephanie's smashing, Priscilla a treat

48:19.480 --> 48:21.523
Veronica, Millicent, Agnes, and Jane

48:21.607 --> 48:23.483
Convivial company, time and again

48:23.568 --> 48:27.070
Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts
I'll agree are three jolly good sports

48:27.154 --> 48:31.616
But cream of the crop, tip of the top
is Mary Poppins and there we stop

50:09.757 --> 50:14.219
When Mary holds your hand
You feel so grand

50:14.303 --> 50:17.972
Your heart starts beatin'
like a big brass band

50:18.057 --> 50:19.432
Woo!

50:20.309 --> 50:24.270
It's a jolly holiday with Mary

50:24.355 --> 50:37.158
No wonder that it's Mary that we love

51:32.465 --> 51:38.011
Yahoo!

51:45.561 --> 51:47.937
Yahoo! Yahoo!

51:48.022 --> 51:51.608
Our own private merry-go-round.

51:51.692 --> 51:55.695
Nice. Very nice, indeed,

51:55.780 --> 51:57.363
if you don't want to go nowhere.

51:58.365 --> 52:01.159
Who says we're not going anywhere?

52:01.243 --> 52:02.452
Oh, guard!

52:02.536 --> 52:05.038
Righto, Mary Poppins.

52:06.540 --> 52:08.291
Thank you.

52:21.096 --> 52:22.138
They're off!

52:22.223 --> 52:25.725
Mary Poppins leads by two lengths,
Jane's second by...

52:49.750 --> 52:51.876
My horse is the fastest.

52:52.711 --> 52:56.756
Hear that, mate?
Want to put up with that?

52:57.466 --> 52:59.843
Is that the best you can do?

52:59.927 --> 53:01.386
Hurry up, boy!

53:01.470 --> 53:03.930
Not so fast, please. Michael.

53:05.599 --> 53:08.101
Bert, you're just as bad.

53:09.270 --> 53:11.604
Sorry. Whoa, boy. Whoa.

53:11.981 --> 53:14.899
Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa.

53:17.152 --> 53:20.697
Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins.

53:20.781 --> 53:24.325
Please control yourself.
We're not on a racecourse.

53:30.249 --> 53:31.958
Follow me, please.

53:47.933 --> 53:50.935
- Good morning.
- Oh, yes, quite. What?

53:54.523 --> 53:56.065
I say.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.735
Have you...

53:58.819 --> 53:59.903
Ever?

54:01.030 --> 54:02.447
Never!

54:10.831 --> 54:14.000
View halloo.

54:14.084 --> 54:16.628
Oh, yes, definitely. A view halloo.

54:16.712 --> 54:18.588
View halloo?

54:18.672 --> 54:20.965
(PLAYING)

54:21.842 --> 54:25.386
Faith and Begorra.
'Tis them redcoats again.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.227
Oh, musha, musha.

54:33.312 --> 54:35.104
Poor little bloke.

54:35.189 --> 54:37.231
Let's give him a hand.

54:37.316 --> 54:39.609
Saints preserve us.

54:39.693 --> 54:41.194
Yikes!

54:43.697 --> 54:46.032
Tally ho! Da-doo da-doo!

54:54.208 --> 54:57.085
Up you go. Now hang on.

55:00.422 --> 55:04.801
Would you look at this?
An elegant merry-go-round horse.

55:07.012 --> 55:11.391
Come on, you dirty omadhauns.
I'll lick all of you.

55:12.226 --> 55:15.186
Faster, me beauty. Faster!

56:05.029 --> 56:08.489
Riders, would you be kind
and let me pass?

56:08.574 --> 56:11.367
Certainly, ma'am.

56:11.452 --> 56:14.078
- Thank you.
- Not at all, ma'am.

56:29.344 --> 56:31.095
Excellent time, gentlemen.

56:31.180 --> 56:33.181
- Quite.
- Perfect day for it.

56:34.641 --> 56:35.892
Ahem.

56:37.186 --> 56:38.770
Oh, how nice.

56:40.230 --> 56:43.941
Hooray! Yay! Yay!

56:47.488 --> 56:50.323
Hold still. Watch the dickie bird.

56:51.825 --> 56:55.578
- How does it feel to win?
- Well...

56:55.662 --> 56:57.914
- Gaining fame and fortune.
- Yes.

56:57.998 --> 57:01.084
- Your picture in the newspaper.
- Actually...

57:01.168 --> 57:04.796
Extreme good looks, may I say?

57:04.880 --> 57:07.173
No words describe your emotion?

57:07.257 --> 57:12.261
Gentlemen, on the contrary,
there's a very good word.

57:12.346 --> 57:14.889
- Right?
- Tell them.

57:14.973 --> 57:16.724
Right.

It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

57:21.730 --> 57:24.816
Even though the sound of it
is something quite atrocious

57:24.900 --> 57:27.860
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious

Um diddle diddle diddle

57:37.663 --> 57:40.373
'Cause I was afraid to speak
when I was just a lad

57:40.457 --> 57:43.709
Me father gave me nose a tweak
and told me I was bad

57:43.794 --> 57:46.796
But then one day I learnt a word
that saved me aching nose

57:46.880 --> 57:49.841
The biggest word you ever heard
and this is how it goes

57:49.925 --> 57:53.302
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

57:53.387 --> 57:56.305
Even though the sound of it

He travelled all around the world
And everywhere he went

58:11.113 --> 58:13.823
He'd use his word and all would say,
"There goes a clever gent"

pass the time of day with me

58:41.185 --> 58:43.936
So when the cat has got your tongue
There's no need for dismay

58:44.021 --> 58:47.106
Just summon up this word
and then you've got a lot to say

58:47.191 --> 58:50.026
But better use it carefully
or it could change your life

58:50.110 --> 58:53.446
For example, I said it to me girl.

58:53.530 --> 58:56.157
Now me girl's me wife.

58:56.241 --> 58:59.660
And a lovely thing she is.

This is hot chestnut weather.

People with wet feet
must take their medicine.

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:32.545

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:07.580
Do you have a handkerchief?

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:09.498
Will you stay if we're good?

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:13.377
A pie crust promise.
Easily made, easily broken.

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:16.172
Whatever would we do without you?

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:18.883
I'll stay until the wind changes.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:21.552
How long will that be?

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:23.721
It's time to go to sleep.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:27.767
We couldn't possibly go to sleep.
So many lovely things happened today!

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:28.934
Did they?

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.103
We jumped into Bert's picture.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.856
The horses fled the carousel.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.108
And we went riding!

Tally ho! Tchunga! Tally ho! Yoicks!

Don't you remember?
You won the race.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:47.578
A respectable person like me?
How dare you.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:50.122
I saw you do it.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:53.751
Another word
and I'll summon a policeman.

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:55.836
I saw it happen!

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:59.048
- Go to sleep.
- I don't want to.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:01.842
We're much too excited.

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:03.260
Very well. Suit yourselves.

Glorious day, Mr Binnacle, glorious.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:03.005
Nobody sleeps this morning.
Put in double powder.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:05.466

Shake things up a bit, what?

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:13.182
- Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.
- Indeed it is, ma'am.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:16.352
- You packed the spoiled eggs?
- Yes.

01:04:16.436 --> 01:04:21.941
After our meeting, we're all going
to throw things at the prime minister.

How distinguished you look today.

01:04:25.654 --> 01:04:28.697
What's all that fearful caterwauling?

01:04:28.782 --> 01:04:30.199
It's cook singing.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:34.370
- What's wrong with her?
- She's happy as a cricket.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.456
Since you hired Mary Poppins,

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:41.126
the most extraordinary thing
has come over the household.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:46.048
- Ellen hasn't broken a dish all morning.
- That is extraordinary.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:51.178
She and cook fight
like cats and dogs, but today...

01:04:51.263 --> 01:04:54.848
- I'll hold the door.
- Thanks ever so.

I'm sorry you're unwell.

I am not out of sorts.
I'm in a perfectly equable mood.

being made to feel better!

a cheerful and pleasant household.

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:10.622
Uncle Albert, you promised.

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.542
Ha-ha! I know.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:17.004
I tried, really, I did. I... Ho ho!

01:10:17.088 --> 01:10:21.049
But I so enjoy laughing. Ah ha ha!

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:25.053
When I start, it's up with... Ha ha ha!

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:27.723
That's what happens.

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:29.349
I love to laugh! Ah ho ho!

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:32.561
Oh, my! I can't help it.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:34.313
Ha ha ha!

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.440
I just like laughing.

01:10:36.608 --> 01:10:38.317
Ha ha! Ha ha!

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:42.321
Don't you dare.
You'll only make him worse.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:46.867
- It's quite serious.
- Keep a straight face.

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:50.537
Last time,
we took three days to get him down.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:55.000
(SINGING) I love to laugh

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.501
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.629
Loud and long and clear

01:10:58.713 --> 01:10:59.755
Ha!

01:10:59.839 --> 01:11:02.341
I love to laugh

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:03.800
Ha ha ha ha!

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:06.511
It's getting worse every year

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:07.638
Ha ha ha!

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.890
The more I laugh

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.183
Ho ho ho!

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.727
The more I fill with glee

01:11:13.811 --> 01:11:15.270
You're no help!

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:16.772
The more the glee

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:18.649
Ha ha ha ha!

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:21.109
The more I'm a merrier me

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:22.277
Hoo hoo hoo!

01:11:22.362 --> 01:11:24.279
It's embarrassing.

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:27.616
The more I'm a merrier me

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.326
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:32.913
Ha ha ha ha!

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:37.209
Some people
laugh through their noses

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.670
Sounding something like this

01:11:39.754 --> 01:11:41.421
Mmm-hmm hmm hmm!

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:42.589
Dreadful.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:44.216
Sss-sss-sss!

01:11:44.676 --> 01:11:48.637
Some people laugh through their teeth
Goodness sakes

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:51.223
Hissing and fizzing like snakes

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:52.307
Sss sss sss!

01:11:52.392 --> 01:11:54.893
Not at all attractive.

01:11:55.395 --> 01:11:57.521
Some laugh too fast

01:11:57.605 --> 01:11:59.356
Hee hee hee hee!

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.234
Some only blast

01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:04.194
Ha!

01:12:05.113 --> 01:12:07.864
Others they twitter like birds

01:12:07.949 --> 01:12:10.117
Hee hee hee hoo!
Hee hee hee hoo!

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:12.744
You're as bad as he is.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:16.748
Then there's that kind
what can't make up their mind

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.251
Hmm hmm hmm, ha ha ha!

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.003
Hee hee hee, ho ho ho!

01:12:21.087 --> 01:12:22.504
Hee ha ho huh?

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:29.386
When things strike me as funny
I can't hide it inside

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:34.057
And squeak, hee,
as the squeakelers do

01:12:34.142 --> 01:12:35.183
Ha ha ha!

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:37.936
I've got to let go

01:12:38.021 --> 01:12:40.856
With a ho ho ho ho

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.107
Ha ha ha ha!

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:47.237
And a ho ho ho, hoo!

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.072
How nice!

01:12:49.157 --> 01:12:52.284
I was hoping you'd turn up.

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:55.203
We always have a jolly time.

01:12:57.123 --> 01:13:00.459
We love to laugh

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:02.044
Ha ha ha ha!

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:04.337
Loud and long and clear

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:05.464
Hoo hoo hoo!

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:07.507
We love to laugh

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:09.718
Ha ha ha ha!

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.803
So everybody can hear

01:13:11.888 --> 01:13:13.138
Ha ha ha!

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.640
The more you laugh

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:18.226
Don't you start. Come back here.

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:19.561
We fill with glee

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:20.645
Hee hee hee!

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:23.190
And the more the glee

01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:24.566
Ha ha ha ha!

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:27.611
The more we're a merrier we

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:37.245
Welcome, children. Welcome.
Make yourselves comfortable.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:39.498
Pull up a chair.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.503
I say, you're a sight.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:48.924
Speaking of sight,
it reminds me of me brother.

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:51.093
He works in a watch factory.

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:53.887
What's he do?

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:57.766
He stands about all day
and makes faces.

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:03.021
Makes faces in a watch factory!

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:06.525
You made that up.

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.281
That's good.

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:15.075
Such behaviour.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:24.960
It's disgraceful
or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:28.296
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:31.174
What's the name of his other leg?

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:35.137
Wasn't that funny?
What's the name of...

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:39.391
Children, it's tea time.
I won't have schedule interruptions.

01:14:39.475 --> 01:14:41.643
Please stay.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:44.104
Look, I have tea ready for you.

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:45.981
And it's getting cold.

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:49.651
I had hoped that maybe you would...

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.949
Splendid! Thank you very much.

01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:58.076
Mind the bread and butter.

01:14:58.161 --> 01:14:59.327
Now watch, children.

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:03.456
I knew she'd do it... A proper tea.

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:06.793
I suppose you'll want me to pour.

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:09.546
If I must, I must.

01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:14.551
But stop behaving
like laughing hyenas.

01:15:14.635 --> 01:15:17.345
- Two lumps, Uncle Albert?
- Yes, please.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:20.807
- Bert?
- None for me.

01:15:20.892 --> 01:15:24.436
I'm glad you came.
It wouldn't be fun otherwise.

01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:27.814
Pour some milk
for Michael and yourself.

01:15:27.899 --> 01:15:31.568
- Nice weather we're having.
- Yes.

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:37.324
The other day when it was cold,
a friend bought long underwear.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:41.494
The shopkeeper said,
"How long do you want it?"

01:15:41.579 --> 01:15:45.373
My friend said,
"From September to March."

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:52.297
Jane! Control yourself!

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:56.885
Children, please sit up properly.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:01.598
- Your tea, Uncle Albert.
- Thank you, dear.

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:03.892
I'm having fun.

01:16:03.976 --> 01:16:07.312
I wish you could always stay here.

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:10.357
We'll have to. There's no way down.

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.692
Oh, there is a way.

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:18.114
I hate mentioning it because
you must think of something sad.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:20.075
Do it, please.

01:16:20.159 --> 01:16:23.078
Let me see.

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:25.580
I've got the very thing.

01:16:25.665 --> 01:16:29.709
Yesterday, when my neighbour
answered the bell, a man was there.

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:36.091
The man said, "I'm terribly sorry.
I just ran over your cat."

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:39.344
- Oh, that's sad.
- The poor cat.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.555
Then he said, "I'll replace your cat."

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.017
She said,
"Okay, but can you catch mice?"

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:52.524
I started out saying...

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:54.901
I try. Really, I do.

01:16:54.986 --> 01:16:58.488
But everything ends up so hilarious.
I can't...

01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.615
I can't help...

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.663
That will be enough of that.

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:09.124
It's time to go home.

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:11.418
Oh, that is sad. Oh, no.

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:14.796
That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:18.091
Come along, children.

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:20.844
Must you really go?

01:17:20.928 --> 01:17:26.725
People come to see me all the time,
and we have such a lovely time.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:32.147
Then they go home,
and I'm very, very sad about it.

01:17:32.231 --> 01:17:34.816
Don't worry. We'll return soon.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.901
It was lovely.

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:40.822
- Keep an eye on him, Bert.
- I'll stay a while.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.490
Thank you.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:45.785
Uncle Albert,

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:49.581
I got a jolly joke
I saved for just such an occasion.

01:17:49.665 --> 01:17:53.001
- Want to hear it?
- I'd be so grateful.

01:17:53.085 --> 01:17:56.588
Righto. It's about me granddad.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:59.007
One night, he had a nightmare.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:03.053
So scared he chewed his pillow to bits.

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:05.680
Next morning, I says,
"How do you feel?"

01:18:05.765 --> 01:18:09.434
He says, "A little down in the mouth."

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:17.525
There's nothing like a good joke.

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:21.738
No, and that's nothing like a good joke.

01:18:37.505 --> 01:18:39.964
Bit late tonight, aren't you?

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:43.301
I say, Banks!

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:45.720
Is anything the matter, Banks?

01:18:45.805 --> 01:18:47.639
Banks!

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:57.190
We're so glad you're home!

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:00.026
We had the most wonderful afternoon.

01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:04.739
I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith.

01:19:04.824 --> 01:19:07.826
We don't know anyone called Smith.

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:12.664
The second chap says,
"What's his other leg's name?"

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:15.667
And a party on the ceiling.

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.502
Children, be quiet.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:20.463
Mary Poppins says we'll go again.

01:19:20.548 --> 01:19:21.673
Oh?

01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:24.175
Oh, Mary Poppins said that?

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.804
Please return to your room.

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:31.558
Mary Poppins, will you come with me?

01:19:31.642 --> 01:19:33.351
As you wish.

01:19:35.855 --> 01:19:39.858
Mary Poppins, I regret what I must say.

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:46.781
Good evening, George.
Is anything the matter?

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:48.032
I'm afraid so.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:51.119
I have to dress for my rally.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:55.165
- I'd rather you be present.
- Of course, George.

01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:59.461
Mary Poppins,
I confess I'm disappointed in you.

01:19:59.545 --> 01:20:03.214
She's for it. I've heard this before.

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:05.467
I don't deny I'm partially responsible

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:10.263
for allowing
the children's worthless frivolity.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:13.141
But they must learn
the seriousness of life.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:15.435
But they're only children.

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:17.645
In light of what's happened...

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.482
George, are you certain?

01:20:20.566 --> 01:20:22.150
I believe I am.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:25.737
(SINGING)
A British bank is run with precision

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:29.657
A British home requires nothing less

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:34.204
Tradition, discipline, and rules
must be the tools

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:39.542
Without them
disorder, chaos, moral disintegration

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:41.628
In short, you have a ghastly mess

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:43.338
I quite agree.

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:47.175
The children must be
moulded, shaped and taught

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:50.678
That life's a looming battle
to be faced and fought

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:55.391
I'm disturbed to hear my children
talking about popping into pictures,

01:20:55.476 --> 01:20:58.811
consorting with racehorse persons,
fox hunting...

01:20:58.896 --> 01:21:02.273
I don't mind that. It's tradition.

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:05.360
But parties on the ceiling?

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:07.362
Having tea parties on the ceiling?

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:10.365
And other highly questionable outings...

01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:12.742
If they must go on outings

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:17.622
These outings ought to be fraught
with purpose, yes, and practicality

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.624
These silly words like

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:21.251
Superca...

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:23.044
Super...

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:24.462
Supercal...

01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:26.506
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:28.174
Yes, well done.

01:21:28.259 --> 01:21:34.389
And popping through pictures
have little use, fulfil no basic need

01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:38.309
They've got to learn the honest truth
Despite their youth

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:39.394
They must learn

01:21:39.478 --> 01:21:41.938
About the life you lead

01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:43.356
Exactly.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:48.570
They must feel the thrill
of totting up a balanced book

01:21:48.654 --> 01:21:51.447
A thousand ciphers neatly in a row

01:21:51.532 --> 01:21:52.740
Quite right.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:56.578
When gazing at a graph
that shows the profits up

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:59.747
Their little cup of joy should overflow

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:01.082
Precisely.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:04.877
It's time they learnt
to walk in your footsteps

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:05.962
My footsteps.

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:08.840
To tread your straight
and narrow path with pride

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:09.924
With pride.

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:11.676
Tomorrow, just as you suggest

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:17.181
Pressed and dressed
Jane and Michael will be at your side

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:20.101
Splendid! You've hit the nail...

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:22.770
At my side? Where are we going?

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.606
To the bank.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:26.733
- The bank?
- Yes.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:29.485
Tomorrow's an important day.

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:32.363
I'll see they
have a proper night's sleep.

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:47.462
Did I say
I'd take the children to the bank?

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:50.131
It sounded that way.

01:22:50.215 --> 01:22:51.299
And why not?

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.884
Capital idea.

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:58.389
Just the medicine they need for all this
sugary female thinking they get here.

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:00.308
Quite right. Good idea.

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.226
Quite right.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.357
Mary Poppins, we won't let you go.

01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:09.108
What do you mean?

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:10.943
Weren't you sacked?

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:13.988
Sacked? I am never sacked.

01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:16.741
- Oh, Mary Poppins!
- Hooray!

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:19.452
Neither am I a maypole.

01:23:19.536 --> 01:23:21.162
- But...
- Goats butt.

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:22.455
Birds fly.

01:23:22.539 --> 01:23:26.668
Children going out with their father
get some sleep.

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.544
An outing with Father?

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:32.048
He's never taken us on an outing.

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:35.093
He's never taken us anywhere.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.136
How did you manage it?

01:23:37.221 --> 01:23:39.847
You gave him the idea.

01:23:39.932 --> 01:23:42.141
How impertinent!

01:23:42.226 --> 01:23:45.019
Me giving ideas to people? Really.

01:23:45.104 --> 01:23:47.689
- Where's he taking us?
- The bank.

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:52.443
Michael, the city!
Father can point out the sights.

01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:54.862
Most things he can.

01:23:55.572 --> 01:24:00.993
Sometimes people, through no fault
of their own, can't see past their nose.

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:03.579
Past their nose?

01:24:03.664 --> 01:24:07.583
Yes. Sometimes
a little thing is quite important.

01:24:07.668 --> 01:24:09.711
Oh, look. The cathedral.

01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:13.089
Father passes that every day.

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:19.137
(SINGING) Early each day
to the steps of St. Paul's

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:24.892
The little old bird woman comes

01:24:25.936 --> 01:24:32.900
In her own special way
to the people she calls

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:40.158
Come buy my bags full of crumbs

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:43.911
Come feed the little birds

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:47.290
Show them you care

01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:53.921
And you'll be glad if you do

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:57.258
Their young ones are hungry

01:24:57.342 --> 01:25:00.720
Their nests are so bare

01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:05.349
All it takes is tuppence

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:11.105
From you

01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:14.901
Feed the birds

01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:18.112
Tuppence a bag

01:25:18.197 --> 01:25:21.616
Tuppence, tuppence

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:25.286
Tuppence a bag

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:28.456
Feed the birds

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:32.084
That's what she cries

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:38.800
While overhead, her birds fill the skies

01:25:38.884 --> 01:25:42.011
All around the cathedral

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:44.639
The saints and apostles

01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:50.812
Look down as she sells her wares

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:54.315
Although you can't see it

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:57.819
You know they are smiling

01:25:57.903 --> 01:26:01.447
Each time someone shows

01:26:01.532 --> 01:26:07.411
That he cares

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:14.585
Though her words are simple and few

01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:18.256
Listen, listen

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:23.219
She's calling to you

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:26.681
Feed the birds

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:30.434
Tuppence a bag

01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:34.647
Tuppence, tuppence

01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:39.110
Tuppence a bag

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:15.563
Though her words are simple and few

01:27:15.647 --> 01:27:19.025
Listen, listen

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:24.196
She's calling to you

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:27.450
Feed the birds

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:32.371
Tuppence a bag

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:38.419
Tuppence

01:27:38.503 --> 01:27:45.468
Tuppence a bag

01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:11.786
Now, remember.
Be on your best behaviour.

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:13.371
Isn't it your bank?

01:28:13.455 --> 01:28:17.208
As a younger officer, it is, sort of.

01:28:17.292 --> 01:28:18.960
Michael, look.

01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:22.880
It's her!

01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:25.549
- Who? It's who?
- The bird woman.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:27.760
Just like Mary Poppins said.

01:28:27.844 --> 01:28:29.470
You see her?

01:28:29.554 --> 01:28:32.932
Of course I can. Do you think
I can't see past the end of my nose?

01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:35.267
Listen, she's saying it.

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:38.145
Feed the birds.

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:39.814
Tuppence a bag.

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:43.067
Of course she's saying it.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.611
- May we feed the birds?
- Whatever for?

01:28:45.696 --> 01:28:48.781
- I have tuppence.
- Just this once.

01:28:48.865 --> 01:28:52.159
Waste your money on birds?
Certainly not.

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:53.661
But Mary Poppins...

01:28:53.745 --> 01:28:59.208
I'm not interested in Mary Poppins
nor in hearing her name.

01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:01.252
But it's my tuppence.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:04.839
Michael, don't throw your money away!

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:08.843
At the bank, I'll show you what to do.

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:10.803
It's extremely interesting.

01:29:46.673 --> 01:29:49.508
Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

01:29:49.593 --> 01:29:51.052
My children.

01:29:51.136 --> 01:29:53.179
Why are they here?

01:29:53.263 --> 01:29:55.389
They're opening an account, sir.

01:29:57.142 --> 01:29:59.060
How much money do you have?

01:29:59.144 --> 01:30:02.271
Tuppence. I want it to feed the birds.

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:04.315
Tuppence!

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:07.234
Tuppence...

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:09.320
Precisely how I started.

01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:19.747
That's the elder Mr Dawes,
a giant in the finance world.

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:21.373
A giant?

01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:24.752
Father, these are Banks' children!

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:27.046
They want to open an account!

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:31.092
Do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent.

01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:37.348
We can use more money
to put to work for the bank.

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:43.562
You have tuppence?

01:30:43.647 --> 01:30:45.648
May I be permitted to see it?

01:30:45.732 --> 01:30:48.067
It's for feeding the birds.

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:51.612
Feed the birds and what have you got?

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:53.697
Fat birds!

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:55.032
But...

01:30:55.117 --> 01:31:01.330
(SINGING) If you invest your tuppence
wisely in the bank

01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:05.709
Safe and sound

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:08.295
Soon that tuppence

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:12.091
Safely invested in the bank

01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:16.470
Will compound

01:31:16.555 --> 01:31:22.560
And you'll achieve
that sense of conquest

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:28.232
As your affluence expands

01:31:30.026 --> 01:31:36.907
In the hands of the directors

01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:39.827
Who invest

01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:46.083
As propriety demands

01:31:46.918 --> 01:31:49.920
- May I, sir?
- Carry on, Banks.

01:31:51.756 --> 01:31:55.843
You see, Michael, you'll be part of
railways through Africa!

01:31:55.927 --> 01:31:57.595
Exactly.

01:31:57.679 --> 01:31:59.346
Dams across the Nile.

01:31:59.431 --> 01:32:03.184
- Talk about the ships.
- Fleets of ocean greyhounds.

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:04.476
Tell them more.

01:32:05.187 --> 01:32:07.521
Majestic self-amortizing canals.

01:32:07.606 --> 01:32:09.857
It fires the imagination!

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:16.864
(SINGING) Plantations of ripening tea

01:32:18.325 --> 01:32:20.951
All from

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:22.494
Tuppence

01:32:22.579 --> 01:32:28.125
Prudently, thriftily, frugally
invested in the...

01:32:28.210 --> 01:32:29.835
To be specific

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:34.965
In the Dawes, Tomes, Mousley, Grubbs

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:37.968
Fidelity Fiduciary bank

01:32:49.231 --> 01:32:51.065
Give me the money, boy.

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:54.151
I want to feed the birds.

01:32:54.236 --> 01:32:55.402
Banks!

01:32:55.487 --> 01:32:57.696
Yes, sir. Now, Michael...

01:32:57.781 --> 01:33:02.243
When you deposit
tuppence in a bank account

01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:03.369
Go on!

01:33:03.453 --> 01:33:06.288
Soon you'll see

01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:07.456
Tell him more!

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:11.460
That it blooms
into credit of a generous amount

01:33:11.544 --> 01:33:15.839
Semi-annually

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:21.262
And you'll achieve that sense of stature

01:33:21.346 --> 01:33:26.350
As your influence expands

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:31.105
To the high financial strata

01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:34.858
That established credit now commands

01:33:36.611 --> 01:33:39.863
You can purchase
first and second trust deeds.

01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:41.657
Imagine the foreclosures,

01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:45.536
bonds, chattels, dividends, shares.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:46.620
Bankruptcies.

01:33:46.705 --> 01:33:47.705
Debtor sales.

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.164
Opportunities.

01:33:49.249 --> 01:33:50.958
Private enterprise.

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:52.126
Shipyards.

01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:53.627
- The mercantile.
- Collieries.

01:33:53.712 --> 01:33:54.753
Tanneries.

01:33:54.838 --> 01:33:56.630
Corporations, amalgamations.

01:33:56.715 --> 01:33:58.132
Banks!

01:33:58.216 --> 01:34:01.051
While stand the Banks of England,

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:03.304
England stands.

01:34:09.853 --> 01:34:12.521
When fall the Banks of England,

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:14.523
England falls!

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:19.445
You see, Michael?

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:21.655
All for the lack of...

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:22.990
Tuppence

01:34:23.074 --> 01:34:24.158
Patiently

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:25.617
Cautiously

01:34:25.702 --> 01:34:29.121
Trustingly invested in the...

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:31.165
To be specific

01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:36.170
In the Dawes, Tomes, Mousley, Grubbs

01:34:36.254 --> 01:34:40.883
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

01:34:40.967 --> 01:34:44.511
Welcome to our joyful
family of investors.

01:34:44.596 --> 01:34:47.348
Give it back!

01:34:47.432 --> 01:34:48.515
Michael, behave...

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.434
Give it to him.

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:57.232
Give me back my money!

01:34:57.317 --> 01:35:00.361
The bank won't
give someone their money.

01:35:00.445 --> 01:35:01.779
I'm getting mine.

01:35:01.905 --> 01:35:03.739
Come along, every penny!

01:35:03.823 --> 01:35:06.200
And give me mine, too.

01:35:10.413 --> 01:35:12.956
Stop all payments.

01:35:31.935 --> 01:35:33.227
Give me my money!

01:35:48.118 --> 01:35:49.326
Children, come back!

01:35:49.411 --> 01:35:50.869
- Stop those children!
- Jane! Michael!

01:35:58.711 --> 01:36:00.337
Come on!

01:36:03.091 --> 01:36:11.432
Stop those children!

01:36:13.518 --> 01:36:14.810
Aah!

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:32.411
Come with me.

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:33.537
Granny will hide you!

01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:51.847
Aah!

01:36:52.682 --> 01:36:54.641
Here, half a mo.

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:56.518
Leave my sister alone.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:58.979
Your friend won't hurt you.

01:37:01.107 --> 01:37:02.900
Bert, it's you.

01:37:03.067 --> 01:37:05.402
In the flesh and at your service.

01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:08.197
You're filthy.

01:37:08.281 --> 01:37:10.699
Perhaps a smudge.

01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:13.076
It so happens
today I'm a chimney sweep.

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:15.537
Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

01:37:16.247 --> 01:37:17.915
Don't take on so.

01:37:17.999 --> 01:37:20.834
Bert will take care of you.
Like I was your own father.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.294
Who's after you?

01:37:22.378 --> 01:37:23.337
Father.

01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:24.421
What?

01:37:24.756 --> 01:37:26.507
We went to his bank.

01:37:26.633 --> 01:37:29.843
We must have done
something dreadful.

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:33.138
The police and army were after us.

01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:35.182
Michael, don't exaggerate.

01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:38.227
There must be some mistake.

01:37:38.311 --> 01:37:40.521
Your dad loves you.

01:37:40.605 --> 01:37:44.441
No, not with the look he had on his face.

01:37:44.609 --> 01:37:46.610
He doesn't like us.

01:37:47.403 --> 01:37:49.613
That don't seem likely, does it?

01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:51.156
It's true.

01:37:53.076 --> 01:37:54.243
Let's sit down.

01:37:55.119 --> 01:37:57.788
Begging your pardon,

01:37:57.872 --> 01:38:00.958
but my heart goes out to your father.

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:05.087
There he is in that cold, heartless bank,

01:38:05.255 --> 01:38:08.799
hemmed in by mounds
of cold, heartless money.

01:38:08.967 --> 01:38:10.926
I don't like seeing
living things caged up.

01:38:11.844 --> 01:38:13.679
Father in a cage?

01:38:13.805 --> 01:38:16.807
Cages come in all sizes and shapes,

01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:18.892
even bank-shaped.

01:38:19.477 --> 01:38:22.145
Father's not in trouble, we are.

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:24.356
Sure about that, are you?

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.986
You've got your mother
to look after you,

01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:32.823
and Mary Poppins
and Constable Jones and me.

01:38:33.032 --> 01:38:35.284
Who looks after your father?

01:38:35.994 --> 01:38:38.912
When something happens,
what does he do?

01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:41.081
Fends for himself, he does.

01:38:41.165 --> 01:38:42.332
Who does he tell?

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.126
No one.

01:38:44.210 --> 01:38:46.503
Don't blab his troubles.

01:38:46.588 --> 01:38:48.338
He pushes on at his job,

01:38:48.464 --> 01:38:51.174
uncomplaining, alone, and silent.

01:38:51.342 --> 01:38:53.468
He's not very silent.

01:38:53.553 --> 01:38:55.429
Michael, be quiet.

01:38:55.513 --> 01:38:58.390
Bert, does Father really need our help?

01:38:59.475 --> 01:39:01.852
It's not my place to say.

01:39:02.478 --> 01:39:06.189
But fathers can always do
with a bit of help.

01:39:06.274 --> 01:39:08.150
I'll take you home.

And that's lucky, too

01:39:37.889 --> 01:39:41.058
Now as the ladder of life
has been strung

01:39:41.184 --> 01:39:44.519
You might think a sweep's
on the bottommost rung

01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:47.939
Though I spends me time
in the ashes and smoke

01:39:48.024 --> 01:39:51.026

Ellen, whoever that is, send them away.

01:40:26.104 --> 01:40:27.854
I'm dreadfully late.

01:40:27.939 --> 01:40:28.897
Yes, mum.

01:40:28.981 --> 01:40:30.190
I'll be leaving.

01:40:30.316 --> 01:40:33.485
Please stay till Father comes home!
Father will feel better

01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:35.570
if you shake hands with him.

01:40:36.948 --> 01:40:38.782
It's the children, mum.

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:40.534
I thought they were with their father.

01:40:40.618 --> 01:40:43.412
You haven't been running off,
have you?

01:40:43.996 --> 01:40:46.123
They haven't exactly been
running away, mum.

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:48.500
They've been frightened
and should be looked after.

01:40:49.127 --> 01:40:52.421
Oh, of course, Mary Poppins will...

01:40:52.505 --> 01:40:54.923
Oh, no, it's her day off.

01:40:55.007 --> 01:40:56.383
Ellen, would you...

01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:59.553
No, mum. I haven't done me brasses.

It's baking day,
and you know how cook is.

01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:09.688
What about you, sir?

01:41:09.814 --> 01:41:12.399
You've been so kind.

01:41:12.525 --> 01:41:14.109
Me, mum?

01:41:14.193 --> 01:41:16.987
Lord mayor's got
a stopped-up chimney.

01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:19.740
How clever of you to know.

01:41:20.158 --> 01:41:21.783
Our drawing room chimney

01:41:21.868 --> 01:41:24.453
is in the most ghastly condition.

01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:27.080
Thank you so much.

01:41:27.165 --> 01:41:31.585
Besides, it will amuse the children.

01:41:31.753 --> 01:41:33.336
The lord mayor's going
to be terrible put out.

01:41:33.463 --> 01:41:34.963
Thank you so much.

01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:36.715
I do appreciate it.

01:41:36.799 --> 01:41:37.924
I must hurry.

01:41:38.009 --> 01:41:41.887
Our gallant ladies in prison
are waiting for me to lead them in song.

And a brush for the flue

01:42:01.783 --> 01:42:04.868
It's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

01:42:04.994 --> 01:42:07.871
You see how wrong people can be?

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:13.043
That's a doorway
to a place of enchantment.

01:42:13.169 --> 01:42:17.547
Up where the smoke
is all billowed and curled

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:20.884
'Tween pavement and stars

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:23.595
Is the chimney sweep world

01:42:24.847 --> 01:42:27.349
When there's hardly no day

01:42:27.642 --> 01:42:29.518
Nor hardly no night

01:42:30.728 --> 01:42:34.314
There's things half in shadow

01:42:34.899 --> 01:42:36.900
And halfway in light

01:42:38.236 --> 01:42:42.072
On the rooftops of London

01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:47.035
Coo, what a sight

01:42:47.745 --> 01:42:50.288
I wish we could go up there.

01:42:50.414 --> 01:42:51.998
I like chimneys.

01:42:52.291 --> 01:42:57.087
Rightly so.
A chimney is a wondrous thing.

01:42:57.171 --> 01:42:59.548
It's built tall up there on the roof.

01:42:59.632 --> 01:43:03.009
The wind blows across her top

01:43:03.094 --> 01:43:05.762
and draws the smoke right up the flue.

01:43:05.847 --> 01:43:09.432
Feel the pull on the end of that brush.

01:43:09.767 --> 01:43:12.352
It's like you've got a whale
at the end of the line, isn't it?

01:43:12.436 --> 01:43:13.603
Michael, be careful.

01:43:13.938 --> 01:43:16.273
Things happen around fireplaces.

Michael, Michael, where are you?

01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:31.496
That's a bit awkward.

01:43:31.789 --> 01:43:34.416
Stop putting ideas in their heads.

01:43:36.168 --> 01:43:37.502
There goes another one.

Shall I go after them?

01:43:38.671 --> 01:43:42.632
They can't
gallivant up there like kangaroos.

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.468
Michael, everything's going to be...

01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:54.477
Will you put your things on?

There you go, Mary Poppins!

01:50:12.606 --> 01:50:14.399

Ain't she beautiful?

01:50:47.975 --> 01:50:49.309
Lovely. Tell your mum.

I'd like to make one thing clear.

01:56:38.617 --> 01:56:39.742
Yes.

It's extremely serious.

That's the truth.

I think it's Mary Poppins.

Since she's come,

01:58:31.772 --> 01:58:33.147
things have happened to me.

01:58:34.733 --> 01:58:36.442
Yes, of course!

With chaos in her wake

01:58:53.752 --> 01:58:59.006
And now my life's ambitions go

With one fell blow

That is all it takes

01:59:26.952 --> 01:59:30.746
It changes bread and water into

01:59:30.831 --> 01:59:32.456

Changing bread into cakes, indeed.

into taking
Jane and Michael to the bank.

Tricked you into that?

02:00:04.072 --> 02:00:05.739
Outrageous!

In 1773, an official of this bank

02:06:09.854 --> 02:06:12.314
unwisely loaned a large sum of money

02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:14.358

02:06:25.828 --> 02:06:28.789
boarded, behaved rudely,

02:06:28.915 --> 02:06:30.540
and threw the tea overboard.

02:06:30.959 --> 02:06:33.669

unsuitable for drinking,

02:08:49.806 --> 02:08:54.142
With due respect,
there's no such thing as you!

02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:57.479
Impertinence, sir!

02:08:57.605 --> 02:09:00.649
Would you
like to hear a marvellous joke?

02:09:00.775 --> 02:09:02.275
A real snapper.

02:09:02.443 --> 02:09:03.902
Joke? Snapper?

02:09:04.112 --> 02:09:08.573
Jane and Michael
meet one day on the street.

02:09:08.658 --> 02:09:13.245
Jane says, "I know a man
with a wooden leg named Smith."

02:09:13.329 --> 02:09:17.332
Michael says,
"What's the name of his other leg?"

02:09:20.002 --> 02:09:22.337
The man's gone mad. Call the guard!

02:09:22.505 --> 02:09:24.464
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

02:09:24.549 --> 02:09:26.341
I'm feeling better!

02:09:26.426 --> 02:09:28.218
Don't strike my father!

02:09:28.302 --> 02:09:30.971
There's the tuppence,
the wonderful, fateful,

02:09:31.055 --> 02:09:33.014
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
tuppence.

02:09:33.850 --> 02:09:35.684
Guard it well. Good-bye!

02:09:35.768 --> 02:09:37.769
Where are you going?

02:09:37.854 --> 02:09:41.815
I might pop through
a chalk pavement picture

02:09:41.899 --> 02:09:45.360
or seize a horse off a merry-go-round

02:09:45.445 --> 02:09:46.862
or fly a kite.

02:09:46.946 --> 02:09:48.572
Only Poppins knows.

02:09:49.407 --> 02:09:51.199
- Poppins?
- My nanny.

02:09:51.284 --> 02:09:53.577
She sings that ridiculous song.

02:09:53.786 --> 02:09:55.745
(SINGING) A spoonful of sugar

02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:58.123
Makes the medicine go down

02:09:58.207 --> 02:10:02.711
The medicine go down

02:10:02.879 --> 02:10:04.004
The medicine...

02:10:05.381 --> 02:10:08.300
Mad as a March hare.

02:10:08.426 --> 02:10:17.058
A wooden leg named Smith.

02:10:19.437 --> 02:10:21.062
A wooden le...

02:10:35.203 --> 02:10:36.745
Father.

02:10:37.079 --> 02:10:38.622
Father!

02:10:38.748 --> 02:10:40.582
Father, come down!

02:10:40.666 --> 02:10:42.083
Daddy!

02:10:42.210 --> 02:10:45.253
Daddy, come back!

02:10:53.846 --> 02:10:55.305
Wind's come around,

02:10:55.389 --> 02:10:58.391
blowing dead on from the west.

02:11:00.394 --> 02:11:02.562
She doesn't care what happens to us.

02:11:02.939 --> 02:11:04.314
She only promised to stay

02:11:04.398 --> 02:11:07.150
till the wind changed, right?

02:11:07.944 --> 02:11:09.528
Bring my hat stand, please.

02:11:13.115 --> 02:11:16.034
Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

02:11:19.288 --> 02:11:22.040
What would happen to me

02:11:22.124 --> 02:11:25.627
if I loved all the children
I said goodbye to?

02:11:28.548 --> 02:11:31.675
That's right. George W. Banks,

02:11:31.759 --> 02:11:34.052
17 Cherry Tree Lane.

02:11:34.136 --> 02:11:36.555
About 6'1 ", I'd say.

02:11:36.639 --> 02:11:40.183
Yes, we rang up his bank first thing.

02:11:40.268 --> 02:11:44.062
We discovered he'd
been discharged last night.

02:11:44.146 --> 02:11:47.482
No telling what he'll do
in a fit of despondency.

02:11:47.567 --> 02:11:49.484
Wouldn't hurt to drag the river.

02:11:49.569 --> 02:11:53.488
There's a spot popular with jumpers.

02:11:53.656 --> 02:11:54.990
Really, Ellen!

02:11:56.659 --> 02:11:59.703
He seemed to have been
a fine, stable gentleman.

02:11:59.787 --> 02:12:02.747
No hanky-panky.

02:12:02.873 --> 02:12:05.917
Regular habits, as far as anyone knows.

02:12:06.002 --> 02:12:08.503
(SINGING) The medicine go down

02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:10.171
Just a spoonful...

02:12:10.256 --> 02:12:11.423
It's him!

02:12:11.507 --> 02:12:13.466
Or something similar.

02:12:13.551 --> 02:12:16.803
A little less noise on the premises.

02:12:16.929 --> 02:12:18.638
I can't understand the inspector.

02:12:20.808 --> 02:12:23.810
Just a spoonful of sugar

02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:26.855
Makes the medicine go down

02:12:26.981 --> 02:12:29.441
You didn't jump in the river.

02:12:29.525 --> 02:12:31.693
How sensible of you.

02:12:31.777 --> 02:12:33.153
It's all right, sir.

02:12:33.237 --> 02:12:34.946
He's been found.

02:12:35.323 --> 02:12:37.407
No, alive,

02:12:37.533 --> 02:12:38.700
or so I presume.

02:12:38.784 --> 02:12:40.577
He's kissing Mrs Banks.

02:12:41.495 --> 02:12:43.204
What happened at the bank?

02:12:43.873 --> 02:12:46.750
I've been sacked, flung into the street.

02:12:46.834 --> 02:12:48.752
A spoonful of sugar

02:12:48.836 --> 02:12:51.421
Makes the medicine go down

02:12:51.505 --> 02:12:55.759
Gone off his crumpet,
that's what he's done.

02:12:55.843 --> 02:12:58.219
Dotty as you please.

02:12:59.096 --> 02:13:01.640
What were you doing in the cellar?

02:13:01.724 --> 02:13:03.558
First, where are the children?

02:13:03.726 --> 02:13:05.644
Jane! Michael!

02:13:05.728 --> 02:13:07.020
Your father's calling.

02:13:07.104 --> 02:13:08.980
It doesn't sound like Father.

02:13:09.065 --> 02:13:10.607
Jane! Michael!

02:13:10.733 --> 02:13:12.734
Run along. Spit spot.

02:13:17.948 --> 02:13:21.117
You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

02:13:21.243 --> 02:13:22.243
Spit spot.

02:13:33.631 --> 02:13:35.215
He mended it!

02:13:40.721 --> 02:13:41.763
It's wonderful!

02:13:41.889 --> 02:13:44.307
However did you manage it?

02:13:44.433 --> 02:13:47.519
(SINGING)
With tuppence for paper and strings

02:13:47.603 --> 02:13:50.855
You can have your own set of wings

02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:53.108
With your feet on the ground

02:13:53.275 --> 02:13:56.361
You're a bird in flight

02:13:56.445 --> 02:14:00.073
With your fist holding tight

02:14:00.199 --> 02:14:01.991
To the string of your kite

02:14:02.284 --> 02:14:04.703
Oh, oh, oh

02:14:05.121 --> 02:14:08.623
Let's go fly a kite

02:14:08.791 --> 02:14:12.210
Up to the highest height

02:14:12.294 --> 02:14:15.505
Let's go fly a kite

02:14:15.631 --> 02:14:19.300
And send it soaring

02:14:19.468 --> 02:14:22.804
Up through the atmosphere

02:14:22.888 --> 02:14:26.391
Up where the air is clear

02:14:26.475 --> 02:14:30.520
Oh, let's go fly a kite

02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:34.774
A proper kite needs a proper tail.

02:14:34.859 --> 02:14:36.526
That's what I said.

02:14:36.652 --> 02:14:38.653
Go fly a kite.

02:14:40.156 --> 02:14:44.033
No, sir. I don't mean you personally.

02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:47.704
Let's go fly a kite

02:14:47.788 --> 02:14:50.915
Up to the highest height

02:14:51.208 --> 02:14:54.335
Let's go fly a kite

02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:58.006
And send it soaring

02:14:58.299 --> 02:15:01.676
Up through the atmosphere

02:15:01.761 --> 02:15:05.138
Up where the air is clear

02:15:05.264 --> 02:15:09.350
Oh, let's go fly a kite

02:15:11.479 --> 02:15:15.106
When you send it flying up there

02:15:15.232 --> 02:15:18.568
All at once you're lighter than air

02:15:18.652 --> 02:15:20.612
You can dance on the breeze

02:15:20.696 --> 02:15:23.740
Over houses and trees

02:15:23.866 --> 02:15:26.326
With your fist holding tight

02:15:27.244 --> 02:15:29.829
To the string of your kite

02:15:29.914 --> 02:15:32.081
Oh, oh, oh

02:15:32.708 --> 02:15:36.169
Let's go fly a kite

02:15:36.253 --> 02:15:39.547
Up to the highest height

02:15:39.632 --> 02:15:43.009
Let's go fly a kite

02:15:43.093 --> 02:15:46.429
And send it soaring

02:15:46.514 --> 02:15:48.807
There you are, Banks.

02:15:48.891 --> 02:15:50.975
Congratulations.

02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:52.602
Capital bit of humour.

02:15:52.728 --> 02:15:55.063
"Wooden leg named Smith,"

02:15:55.147 --> 02:15:57.440
or Jones, whatever it was.

02:15:57.525 --> 02:15:58.900
Father died laughing.

02:16:00.653 --> 02:16:02.278
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

02:16:02.363 --> 02:16:05.490
Nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about.

02:16:05.616 --> 02:16:07.992
Never seen him happier.

02:16:08.077 --> 02:16:10.245
He left an opening for a new partner.

02:16:10.454 --> 02:16:12.580
Congratulations.

02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:16.251
Thank you very much indeed, sir.

02:16:16.335 --> 02:16:19.838
Up through the atmosphere

02:16:19.922 --> 02:16:23.049
Up where the air is clear

02:16:23.133 --> 02:16:27.178
Oh, let's go

02:16:28.097 --> 02:16:29.138
Fly a kite

02:16:31.767 --> 02:16:34.686
Awk! That's gratitude for you.

02:16:34.812 --> 02:16:36.855
Didn't even say goodbye.

02:16:36.939 --> 02:16:38.231
No, they didn't.

02:16:38.357 --> 02:16:39.816
Look at them.

02:16:39.900 --> 02:16:44.279
They think more
of their father than of you.

02:16:44.362 --> 02:16:46.531
That's as it should be.

02:16:46.615 --> 02:16:48.907
Don't you care?

02:16:48.993 --> 02:16:51.369
Practically perfect people
never permit sentiment

02:16:51.452 --> 02:16:52.954
to muddle their thinking.

02:16:53.038 --> 02:16:54.706
Is that so?

02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:58.376
Mary Poppins, you don't fool me.

02:16:58.459 --> 02:16:59.544
Really?

02:16:59.628 --> 02:17:03.172
Really. I know how you feel.

02:17:03.257 --> 02:17:07.260
If you think
I'm keeping my mouth shut...

02:17:07.887 --> 02:17:11.347
That will be quite enough, thank you.

02:17:33.537 --> 02:17:35.245
Goodbye, Mary Poppins.

02:17:35.331 --> 02:17:36.664
Don't stay away too long.

02:18:23.545 --> 02:18:26.297
Oh, oh, oh

02:18:26.382 --> 02:18:29.925
Let's go fly a kite

02:18:30.010 --> 02:18:33.429
Up to the highest height

02:18:33.513 --> 02:18:36.933
Let's go fly a kite

02:18:37.017 --> 02:18:40.477
And send it soaring

02:18:40.562 --> 02:18:44.065
Up through the atmosphere

02:18:44.148 --> 02:18:47.652
Up where the air is clear

02:18:47.736 --> 02:18:52.323
Oh, let's go

02:18:52.407 --> 02:18:55.535
Fly a kite
