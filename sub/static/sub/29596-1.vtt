01:19.680 --> 01:20.612
- [Tommy] Yeah.

someone's following you?

01:32.326 --> 01:33.392
- No, no.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.860
Nothing like that.

someone's

01:38.732 --> 01:40.399

02:01.889 --> 02:03.455

think

02:03.457 --> 02:05.724
that there was a camera in the
shower head

02:06.760 --> 02:10.596
and I refused to take a
bath unless they put a cloth

02:10.598 --> 02:14.466
on the shower head and when
I was older I knew better,

02:14.468 --> 02:19.538
but I still kind of wondered
and when I was 16 I got drunk

02:21.709 --> 02:24.510
and I started talking to
the man behind the camera

02:26.413 --> 02:30.349
and I masturbated in front of
the camera.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.283
- Okay.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.220
- I ended up throwing up on
myself.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.715
- About four minutes in that
time.

- Four minutes.

That's like a whole five

what you're talking about.

She was such an obnoxious
client.

that decided

03:32.546 --> 03:33.845
to work full time for her.

- Yeah, let's do it.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.368
- [Danielle] Information at its
border.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.037
- [Craig] It's basically that
the universe

13:59.039 --> 14:02.073
is just a computer program.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.277
- [Danielle] It's an illusion.

14:07.514 --> 14:11.282
- [Craig] It's a series
of binary computations.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.252
- [Danielle] It's how we
interpret the information.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.555
- [Man] That result in what we
understand.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.257
- [Woman] The universe is real.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.327
- [Man] As reality.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.028
- [Woman] But what we
think the universe is.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.346
- [Tommy] Oh fuck.

14:25.347 --> 14:26.663
- [Woman] Isn't what the
universe is.

14:26.664 --> 14:27.980
- [Jennifer] What happened?

14:27.981 --> 14:29.297
- Someone just outbid me
for Beneath the Black Moon.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.401
- [Jennifer] That sucks.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.337
- I mean $600 for a tape.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.205
It's rare but what the fuck?

14:35.075 --> 14:36.007
- That's nuts.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.543
- I've just grown a second head.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.945
- [Craig] Result in what we
understand.

14:40.947 --> 14:43.298
- Awesome.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.650
Maybe that'll will make
you a better kisser.

14:47.153 --> 14:51.022
- [Danielle] Information at
the border describing it.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.392
- [Craig] All the way down
to the subatomic level.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.031
- I'm sorry you didn't get the
tape.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.004
- It's fucked up someone
would spend so much.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.172
- Well how much would
you be willing to spend?

15:10.310 --> 15:11.242
- I don't know.

15:12.545 --> 15:13.645
$500.

15:13.647 --> 15:14.979
- $500?

15:14.981 --> 15:15.647
- $500.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.849
- Really?

15:17.850 --> 15:20.050
If you're willing to go that
high, why not just go for six?

15:20.654 --> 15:22.253
I mean, if you really want it
that bad,

15:22.255 --> 15:23.688
you should just go for it.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.423
- I can't now, can I?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.425
Auction's over.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.694
- I'm sure there are more out
there.

15:29.696 --> 15:30.628
You'll find it.

15:32.098 --> 15:35.166
- [Craig] Is generated but the
outcomes

15:35.168 --> 15:38.236
of the binary questions that
result

15:38.238 --> 15:42.507
in what we understand as
reality.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.414
- [Danielle] Information at
the border describing it.

15:50.350 --> 15:54.452
- [Craig] All the way down
to the subatomic level.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.257
- [Danielle] People are just
information.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.011
[Jennifer] What?

16:03.012 --> 16:04.662
How is Tank Girl not available
to stream?

16:04.664 --> 16:06.364
What is this bullshit?

16:06.366 --> 16:07.632
- Why don't either of us own
Tank Girl?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.367
- You can't own Tank Girl.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.234
You can't own her.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.269
- I mean the DVD

16:11.270 --> 16:12.303
- She's her own independent
woman.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.272
You can't own her.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.041
One of us should have the DVD.

16:17.043 --> 16:17.742
- You're drunk.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.479
Hey.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.047
- [Andrea] Hey.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.482
Sorry to interrupt.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.217
- Oh you're not.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.585
We haven't found anything to
watch yet.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.087
- We were gonna watch Tank Girl.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.089
- But it's not available.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.256
- Oh bummer.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.025
How's it going, Jennifer?

16:34.027 --> 16:36.044
- Ah, it's okay.

16:36.045 --> 16:38.062
Think one of Tommy's VHS
friends wants to fuck him.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.199
- Oh.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.469
- He does know Tommy's with you,
right?

16:44.471 --> 16:46.471
And like not into guys.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.139
- It's a girl.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.073
She's pretty.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.743
Like a metal type girl.

16:51.745 --> 16:55.313
Like a Metallica concert going
type girl.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.448
Maybe The Cure.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.352
- Has she said something to you?

17:02.455 --> 17:05.056
- She just seems really friendly

17:05.058 --> 17:07.125
and that seems really
strange to me.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.492
- He hasn't even shown
any interest in her?

17:08.494 --> 17:09.560
- A little.

17:09.561 --> 17:10.762
Not really.

17:10.763 --> 17:13.048
- Okay.

17:13.049 --> 17:15.333
I have work to do so I'll
let you guys be alone.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.135
- Sure you don't wanna hang?

17:17.137 --> 17:18.903
- No, I do.

17:18.904 --> 17:20.670
It's just I have a filing
deadline due on Thursday

17:20.673 --> 17:22.807
and a shit ton of work to do so.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.541
- Night.

17:26.445 --> 17:28.780
- Everything will Tommy is gonna
be okay.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.415
- It's just weird.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.783
- [Andrea] It's gonna be okay.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.251
- Thank you.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.185
- [Andrea] Night.

17:42.695 --> 17:43.694
- Are you alright?

17:44.764 --> 17:47.098
- I feel like I should be.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.733
Shouldn't I?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.134
But I'm not.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.569
That's what worries me.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.742
- Have you found anything
else out about the tape?

17:57.744 --> 18:00.745
- No, I'm just playing phone
tag with this Danielle.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.964
- [Lesley] She's on the tape?

18:02.965 --> 18:05.182
- Yeah, but I don't know if
she knows anything about it.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.584
- Maybe it's not worth pursuing.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.019
- No.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.453
I wanna find out more about the
tape.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.557
It's just everything's
really messed up right now.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.427
I feel like I don't know what
I'm doing.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.163
(bright music)

18:26.339 --> 18:28.473
- Inspiration for a better life.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.141
Get some inspiration.

18:30.844 --> 18:33.444
(soft music)

18:45.825 --> 18:46.824
- [Jennifer] It's cool, I
checked.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.758
- [Tommy] Yeah for now.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.427
- [Jennifer] We'll be quick.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.561
- [Tommy] This is crazy.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.462
- [Jennifer] It'll be fun.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.031
Come on.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.599
- [Tommy] We should not be in
here.

18:54.601 --> 18:55.466
- Come on.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.734
- I don't know.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.470
Sh.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.471
- What's the matter?

19:00.473 --> 19:01.539
- Someone's gonna come in.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.673
- Then we'll go into the stall.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.525
- No, no, no, no.

19:04.526 --> 19:06.376
Hey, I'm gonna go back out there
okay.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.648
(soft music)

19:17.290 --> 19:19.624
- You're doing great, Benji.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.494
(fly buzzing)

19:40.747 --> 19:43.181
- Where do flies come from?

19:43.183 --> 19:45.650
(fly buzzing)

19:47.187 --> 19:47.952
- Excuse me?

19:47.954 --> 19:49.320
- Flies.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.222
They just seem to come from
nowhere.

19:51.224 --> 19:54.458
Like in the spring time there
are no flies

19:54.460 --> 19:56.460
and then there are flies.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.932
They just come out of the air.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.470
- They're hatched from eggs.

20:10.243 --> 20:12.227
- I know.

20:12.228 --> 20:14.212
It's just seems like
they come from nowhere.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.550
(soft music)

20:19.552 --> 20:20.418
Too much blue.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.285
Not enough blue.

20:21.287 --> 20:21.953
The logo's too big.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.354
The logo's too small.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.589
We don't wanna pay for any of
this.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.958
Blah blah blah blah.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.292
- [Narrator] When it is
time for the fly to emerge,

20:28.294 --> 20:30.394
body juices inflate this sack,

20:30.396 --> 20:32.463
causing the pupil case to split
open.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.232
- You can't pause it?

20:34.234 --> 20:34.899
- [Tommy] I'm sorry.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.934
- It's just never mind.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.303
- [Tommy] I can switch it off if
you want.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.889
- I don't care.

20:41.890 --> 20:44.474
- What about if we put
the tape from Kyle's box?

20:47.013 --> 20:47.878
- Sure.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.780
Put it on.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.681
I mean, it's probably 75%
tentacle rape knowing Kyle.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.751
- That's not true.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.586
Don't say that.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.420
Knowing Kyle it's probably
85% tentacle rape.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.724
- Drink?

21:00.927 --> 21:01.859
- I'm okay.

21:23.016 --> 21:25.750
(upbeat music)

21:26.786 --> 21:28.786
- [Danielle] Three technical
projection.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.522
(upbeat music)

21:33.059 --> 21:34.825
- [Craig] I'm kind of a fiend.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.794
- [Danielle] According to
the holographic principle,

21:36.796 --> 21:38.796
a three dimensional object.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.998
- [Man] For fringe scientific
theories.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.036
- Hey, what did you think of the
tape?

21:45.038 --> 21:46.003
- It was weird.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.841
- Who do you think made it?

21:50.843 --> 21:51.909
- I don't know.

21:51.910 --> 21:52.976
There were a lot of guys that
made

21:52.977 --> 21:54.043
mashup tapes like that before.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.383
- What do you think he meant by
it?

21:59.385 --> 22:00.318
- By the tape?

22:00.320 --> 22:02.620
- Yeah, what did it mean?

22:02.622 --> 22:03.888
- Fuck if I know.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.730
(soft music)

22:16.969 --> 22:17.902
Sorry.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.504
- No, it was fine.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.605
- What's up?

22:33.119 --> 22:34.051
Hey listen.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.557
I was just about to crash.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.593
I'm really tired.

22:43.696 --> 22:44.628
- Okay.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.107
You're not even coming to bed?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.877
- I gotta be up early in the
morning.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.580
I don't wanna disturb you.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.514
- Yeah okay.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.082
Thanks.

23:05.084 --> 23:09.553
- Hey, Kyle said that you
were asking about that tape.

23:12.158 --> 23:15.993
- Yeah, I was trying to
see where it came from.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.397
Play detective, you know.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.732
(screaming from the TV)

23:28.007 --> 23:28.939
Goodnight.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.679
(soft music)

23:41.454 --> 23:44.455
- Maybe you should just focus
on something else for awhile.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.791
Something that doesn't
make you feel so judged.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.126
- Yeah, I guess your right.

23:49.128 --> 23:54.064
There is this tape that picked
out from his friend Kyle.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.599
It's pretty interesting.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.133
Some underground
production stuff.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.804
Guess I wanna learn more
about that.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.572
- [Lesley] How so?

24:01.574 --> 24:02.706
- Who made the tape?

24:02.708 --> 24:03.674
Why they made it?

24:03.676 --> 24:05.042
- So do that.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.510
Go forth and investigate.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.079
- Well, I think that we
should have some drinks

24:09.081 --> 24:11.048
before we make any decision.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.452
- To the subatomic level.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.589
(bright music)

24:21.527 --> 24:24.528
(doorbell ringing)

24:33.473 --> 24:35.072
- [Carrie] Oh hey Jennifer.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.507
- [Jennifer] Hi.

24:36.509 --> 24:39.009
- [Carrie] You guys having fun?

24:39.011 --> 24:40.678
- [Jennifer] Sure yeah.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.213
- Alright cool.

24:42.215 --> 24:43.881
Hey, is Tommy around?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.101
- Yeah.

24:47.102 --> 24:49.052
- I just needed to ask
his advice on something.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.588
Hey.

24:50.590 --> 24:52.756
I was chatting with you.

24:52.758 --> 24:55.159
(soft music)

25:04.971 --> 25:05.870
- Hey Kyle.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.004
- What's up?

25:07.006 --> 25:08.606
- Actually, I wanted to ask you

25:08.608 --> 25:10.107
about that tape I got from you.

25:11.611 --> 25:12.676
- What tape?

25:16.182 --> 25:18.516
- The homemade tape.

25:18.518 --> 25:19.850
- [Kyle] Weird ass tape.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.752
- Yeah, I was wondering
who made it.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.588
- Some mashup guy maybe.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.991
- [Jennifer] Do you know
someone who might know?

25:26.993 --> 25:28.838
- [Kyle] Craig.

25:28.839 --> 25:30.684
He's in the beginning
of the tape.

25:30.685 --> 25:32.530
He doesn't get out much but
he's pretty active online.

25:32.532 --> 25:33.697
He might know.

25:33.699 --> 25:37.701
- Do you have like an email
or phone number for him or?

25:37.703 --> 25:38.636
- [Kyle] Yeah.

25:39.705 --> 25:40.638
- Awesome.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.946
Sounded like it was good.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.681
- [Woman] So you're
not gonna tell anybody?

25:50.683 --> 25:51.615
- No.

25:52.885 --> 25:53.884
- [Woman] Thanks.

26:05.831 --> 26:06.697
- Yeah.

26:06.699 --> 26:07.565
- And anyone?

26:07.567 --> 26:08.232
- Yeah bring everyone.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.667
I'll see you later.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.203
What's up?

26:17.109 --> 26:18.976
- [Jennifer] Nothing.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.579
- You okay?

26:23.916 --> 26:27.685
- Just need another one or six.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.287
(phone ringing)

26:44.637 --> 26:45.669
Shut up.

26:47.773 --> 26:48.706
(Vomiting)

26:49.308 --> 26:52.309
- Inspiration for a better life.

26:52.311 --> 26:53.344
- [Larraine On The Phone]
Hi, this is Larraine

26:53.346 --> 26:55.112
from Carter- Cord Investments.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.014
I'm leaving a message for
Jennifer.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.816
We had a meeting
scheduled for this morning

26:58.818 --> 27:00.751
to discuss your designs.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.387
The meeting was over two hours
ago.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.788
We haven't heard from you.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.890
Please contact our office to
reschedule.

27:06.892 --> 27:07.825
- Fuck.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.195
(dissonant music)

27:12.932 --> 27:15.666
- It's better.

27:16.769 --> 27:17.968
- It is better.

27:19.739 --> 27:23.040
The logo is kind of weird
looking.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.708
- I was just going to say that.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.809
It's a little weird.

27:26.646 --> 27:27.845
- It's your logo.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.880
It's the one you sent me.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.149
- It seems a bit distorted.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.751
- That's right, distorted.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.686
Distorted is a good word for it.

27:36.389 --> 27:38.389
- That's what happens when you
blow it up.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.824
I asked if you had a larger
copy.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.696
- I don't remember talking
about a larger copy.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.399
- I think I remember
something about a larger logo.

27:48.401 --> 27:49.800
- Oh.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.135
Oh, we wanted it larger.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.370
- This is too large.

27:53.372 --> 27:54.972
Now it's all distorted.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.674
- Yeah, it's too distorted.

27:56.676 --> 27:57.808
We can't use this.

27:58.778 --> 28:02.746
- This is exactly what
you asked for.

28:03.716 --> 28:04.949
- Oh really?

28:04.950 --> 28:06.183
You think we would've
asked for this?

28:07.319 --> 28:10.187
And the blue is just.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.923
Is it me or is not blue enough?

28:19.899 --> 28:20.764
- Hey.

28:20.766 --> 28:21.865
- Yo.

28:21.867 --> 28:22.733
- What's up?

28:22.735 --> 28:23.400
- What's up, man?

28:23.402 --> 28:24.334
Anything good, anything?

28:26.472 --> 28:27.371
- [Tommy] This.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.271
(Cellphone Alert Vibration)

28:28.274 --> 28:32.009
- On the same shelf
as Wizard of Oz.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.811
So what homemade?

28:33.813 --> 28:35.035
Recorded off TV?

28:35.036 --> 28:36.258
(Cellphone alert vibration)

28:36.259 --> 28:37.481
- [Tommy] I'm gonna find out.

28:37.483 --> 28:38.415
- Aw man.

28:39.919 --> 28:40.851
What's up?

28:41.821 --> 28:44.088
- Just got a text from Jennifer.

28:44.089 --> 28:46.356
She wants to know if I'm coming
home from dinner tonight.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.357
- Everything okay?

28:48.294 --> 28:49.226
- Yeah.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.062
Better get going.

28:52.064 --> 28:52.930
- Alright bro.

28:52.932 --> 28:53.797
- See you around.

28:53.799 --> 28:56.600
- Yeah.

28:56.601 --> 28:59.402
Oh, I found a stack of Cap Hap
tapes.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.270
So what do you say?

29:00.272 --> 29:01.238
Movie night next week?

29:02.975 --> 29:06.744
- Oh, you heard anything
about Beneath the Black Moon?

29:06.746 --> 29:08.445
- I got my head to the street
for you.

29:08.447 --> 29:10.147
Have you seen the auction
though?

29:10.149 --> 29:11.448
- Yeah.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.349
It's expensive.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.417
- It's ridiculous.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.752
I looked this morning.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.386
$75 bucks.

29:19.792 --> 29:20.524
OD.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.092
- I'm going.

29:22.094 --> 29:22.960
- [Kyle] Absolutely.

29:22.962 --> 29:23.961
Hey next week?

29:25.965 --> 29:27.030
- [Tommy] Next week.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.047
- So where's Jen tonight?

29:45.050 --> 29:48.819
- She's hanging out with Lesley.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.021
Been hanging out a lot lately.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.056
- She ever find out who made
that tape?

29:54.026 --> 29:54.958
- I don't know.

30:02.034 --> 30:02.900
Hey.

30:02.902 --> 30:03.867
- Hey guys.

30:03.869 --> 30:04.835
- [Kyle] Hey Carrie.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.170
- Glad you could make it.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.504
We were just deciding what to
watch.

30:07.506 --> 30:08.972
- That's cool.

30:08.974 --> 30:13.944
I feel like you've been looking
for this.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.013
- Oh my God.

30:17.116 --> 30:18.215
What is this?

30:18.217 --> 30:19.550
Where'd you get this?

30:19.552 --> 30:22.186
What do you want for it?

30:22.188 --> 30:23.320
- You can owe me.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.822
- What?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.323
- I mean, I know you've been
looking for it for forever

30:26.325 --> 30:29.293
and I saw it on a stoop
sale so I picked it up.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.361
- Wow.

30:32.865 --> 30:33.597
Thank you.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.836
- Maybe you can buy me a drink
sometime.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.408
- Yeah, I would like that.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.144
- [Carrie] Alright, it's a date.

30:48.113 --> 30:49.546
If you guys just excuse me for a
moment.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.949
- Yeah go ahead, go ahead.

30:55.921 --> 30:58.222
Wow man, I can't believe she
found this.

31:01.227 --> 31:02.092
Crazy.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.026
- Dude.

31:03.863 --> 31:04.862
- [Tommy] What man?

31:09.301 --> 31:10.167
Hey.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.134
- [Jennifer] Hey.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.302
- [Kyle] Hey Jen.

31:12.304 --> 31:13.937
- Hey.

31:13.939 --> 31:15.672
Shit, I'm sorry.

31:15.673 --> 31:17.406
I forgot that you guys
were coming by tonight.

31:19.044 --> 31:21.144
- Hey look what Carrie found.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.646
- [Jennifer] Oh cool.

31:22.647 --> 31:24.147
That's the tape you've
been looking for right.

31:24.149 --> 31:25.315
- Yeah.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.283
- [Jennifer] Cool.

31:27.586 --> 31:28.585
Hi.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.087
- Hey.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.388
- [Jennifer] So you got the tape

31:31.390 --> 31:34.024
that he's been looking for
forever.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.425
- Yeah.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.360
Crazy right?

31:37.429 --> 31:40.030
(soft music)

31:40.900 --> 31:41.632
- Yeah.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.536
So I'm just gonna leave
you guys alone tonight.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.139
Crash, something.

31:51.977 --> 31:52.910
- Later, Jen.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.279
- Later, Kyle.

31:59.051 --> 31:59.917
- Good.

31:59.919 --> 32:00.651
Good choice.

32:03.989 --> 32:05.022
- Dude, she okay?

32:06.225 --> 32:07.925
- Yeah, I think she'll be fine.

32:11.630 --> 32:14.231
- Thank you so much for
letting me use your phone.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.299
I won't be long.

32:15.301 --> 32:16.366
- Yeah, no problem.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.036
- Oops.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.504
I'm so clumsy.

32:20.506 --> 32:23.240
(soft music)

32:23.242 --> 32:26.543
Is there any way that
I could ever thank you

32:26.545 --> 32:29.212
for everything that you've done
for me?

32:30.249 --> 32:31.181
- Well.

32:35.187 --> 32:36.553
- [Diana] Terry?

32:36.555 --> 32:39.189
- [Terry] Diana, it's
not what it looks like.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.158
- [Diana] It looks like you're

32:41.159 --> 32:43.126
<i> kissing this whore.</i>
- Where's Jennifer tonight?

32:43.128 --> 32:44.428
- [Terry] She's not a
whore, she just needed

32:44.430 --> 32:46.213
to come in and make a phone
call.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.997
- She's probably out
with her friend Lesley.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.499
- [Diana] In your mouth?!?!

32:55.140 --> 32:57.507
- Is there any way that
I could ever thank you

32:57.509 --> 32:59.509
for everything that you've done
for me?

33:01.213 --> 33:02.145
- Well.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.316
- [Diana] Terry?

33:07.519 --> 33:10.153
- Diana, it's not what it looks
like.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.289
- It looks like you're kissing
this whore.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.058
- She's not a whore.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.394
She just needed to come
in and make a phone call.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.562
- In your mouth?

33:21.033 --> 33:23.033
- [Craig] Yeah, I don't know.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.768
I don't know who made it.

33:24.769 --> 33:26.502
I don't know why Kyle
would tell you I did.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.572
- He didn't say that you made
it.

33:28.574 --> 33:31.141
He was just saying that
maybe you knew who did.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.411
- I don't.

33:37.783 --> 33:39.082
- But you were in it.

33:39.718 --> 33:40.650
- Yeah.

33:42.321 --> 33:46.590
Yeah, that was just interview
I did for a friend's movie.

33:46.592 --> 33:47.624
DVD extra.

33:47.626 --> 33:52.763
I don't know why or who
someone would put it on tape.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.131
I don't know.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.400
Wait.

33:56.402 --> 33:57.567
Why are you interested?

33:58.637 --> 34:00.804
- I'm just curious
about the meaning of it.

34:03.809 --> 34:08.178
- Like the objective
meaning of what it is?

34:08.179 --> 34:09.112
- Yeah.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.483
- Do you believe there's such a
thing?

34:13.485 --> 34:17.654
Like we can even know
what objective meaning is?

34:19.458 --> 34:20.389
- I guess so.

34:22.594 --> 34:25.728
- You ever heard of the
digital model of the universe.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.465
No.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.565
Well.

34:33.605 --> 34:37.541
I'm kind of a fiend for
fringe scientific theories.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.643
There's this one theory.

34:40.646 --> 34:44.781
It's kind of interesting.

34:44.783 --> 34:49.853
It's basically that the universe
is just a computer program.

34:51.857 --> 34:55.692
It's a series of binary
computations

34:55.694 --> 35:00.764
that result in what we
understand as you know reality.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.735
- [Jennifer] So the universe
isn't real?

35:07.139 --> 35:07.871
- No.

35:07.873 --> 35:10.474
Nope, that's not what that
means.

35:11.510 --> 35:14.511
It means what is real is
generated

35:15.481 --> 35:17.581
by the outcomes of these binary
questions

35:18.851 --> 35:23.186
all the way down to the
subatomic level.

35:25.691 --> 35:29.426
The universe is a computer
program describing the universe.

35:29.428 --> 35:30.360
Basically.

35:31.430 --> 35:34.664
Sort of but the universe.

35:35.667 --> 35:39.302
The program that describes it is
actually

35:39.304 --> 35:42.506
embedded in another
program and another program

35:42.508 --> 35:44.341
into another program and this
goes on

35:44.343 --> 35:46.209
until you get to the
simplest of these programs.

35:46.211 --> 35:50.814
A program that describes
all the possible outcomes.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.517
- So everything is a computer
game

35:53.519 --> 35:56.219
and objective meaning isn't
important

35:56.221 --> 35:59.322
because we are just a set of
outcomes

35:59.324 --> 36:02.292
embedded into another set of
outcomes?

36:02.294 --> 36:03.226
- Maybe.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.829
I don't know.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.331
Can the results of the program
understand

36:08.333 --> 36:09.833
how the program works?

36:13.438 --> 36:17.374
Does it have an implication
for objective meaning?

36:18.544 --> 36:19.576
- [Jennifer] That's your theory.

36:19.578 --> 36:20.510
- No, it's not.

36:20.512 --> 36:25.949
It's just one that I find
interesting.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.318
- [Jennifer] Still wanna
find out who made the tape.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.252
- I don't know.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.289
I'm sorry.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.625
- [Danielle] The universe is
real.

36:38.230 --> 36:40.463
- [Tommy] Still watching this
tape.

36:40.465 --> 36:41.898
- I met this guy today.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.267
- [Tommy] Does he know who made
the tape?

36:44.269 --> 36:45.468
- Nope.

36:45.470 --> 36:46.403
- [Tommy] Great.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.672
What did he have to say?

36:48.674 --> 36:50.373
- That's why I'm watching it
again.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.809
He says the same thing
he says on the tape.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.378
- [Tommy] Has you fixated, huh?

36:55.380 --> 36:56.913
- I think that he actually
repeated

36:56.915 --> 36:59.816
the whole thing word for word.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.284
- [Tommy] Okay.

37:01.286 --> 37:02.752
- Or close enough.

37:04.823 --> 37:05.889
- [Tommy] Listen.

37:05.890 --> 37:06.956
Kyle said there's shop in Soho

37:06.959 --> 37:08.408
that may have Beneath the Black
Moon,

37:08.409 --> 37:09.858
so I'm gonna see if I
can get my hands on it.

37:09.861 --> 37:10.894
- [Jennifer] It's kind of late.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.229
- [Tommy] I know.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.799
- What makes this movie so
interesting?

37:15.801 --> 37:18.268
I'm not trying to
criticize but I don't get

37:18.270 --> 37:20.637
why this one is so important.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.239
- It's a rarity is all.

37:22.241 --> 37:23.907
I borrowed it once when
I was a kid back home.

37:23.909 --> 37:24.774
I haven't seen it since.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.543
- It was that good?

37:26.545 --> 37:27.761
- It was terrible.

37:27.762 --> 37:28.978
- I don't think I get it.

37:28.981 --> 37:30.780
- It's just a rarity okay.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.515
It's not available in any other
format.

37:32.517 --> 37:35.252
These tapes are the only
versions of it that exist.

37:35.254 --> 37:38.355
- It's terrible but you want to
preserve?

37:38.357 --> 37:39.789
- Yeah Jen, what is the problem
here?

37:39.791 --> 37:40.824
- I don't have a problem.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.025
I'm just curious.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.827
Why do you want this one tape?

37:43.829 --> 37:45.996
- Because it's hard to find.

37:45.998 --> 37:48.498
- Guess I can kind of get that.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.968
- God damn it.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.377
Never mind, it's a false alarm.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.747
- [Danielle] The universe is
real.

38:03.749 --> 38:04.815
- Sorry.

38:04.816 --> 38:05.882
- But what we think the universe
is

38:05.884 --> 38:06.750
isn't what the universe is.

38:06.752 --> 38:08.685
It's just information.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.393
- He said he forgot.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.627
- [Lesley] Really?

38:17.629 --> 38:18.561
- It's okay I guess.

38:18.563 --> 38:20.697
- No, it's not okay.

38:20.699 --> 38:22.565
Forgot?!? Jesus.

38:22.567 --> 38:23.433
- Relax.

38:23.435 --> 38:24.934
- No, I'm not gonna relax.

38:24.936 --> 38:27.470
He's just canceling on
you, on us just like that?

38:27.472 --> 38:30.006
- He said he had plans
with Carrie and Kyle.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.875
- [Lesley] Carrie's the cute one
right?

38:33.645 --> 38:36.046
(VHS Tape Rewind Sound)

38:43.021 --> 38:44.087
- [Carrie] Hey guys.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.088
- [Tommy] Hey, how are you?

38:45.090 --> 38:46.623
- [Carrie] Good.

38:49.661 --> 38:53.463
- I was gonna make some
but not much of a cook.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.931
- Oh, no thank you.

38:54.933 --> 38:55.965
These look great.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.803
- I didn't make these either
but I thought they'd be okay.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.004
- [Carrie] These are great.

39:06.078 --> 39:08.111
So, how's work?

39:08.113 --> 39:10.013
Tommy's said you've been getting

39:10.015 --> 39:11.915
dicked around by some customers.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.634
- Oh yeah, no.

39:13.635 --> 39:15.352
They just keep trying to
make changes to things

39:15.354 --> 39:17.520
and then trying to weasel out of
paying.

39:17.522 --> 39:20.924
I'm surprised that you
and Tommy talk about me.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.025
I thought you guys would be all

39:22.027 --> 39:23.893
obsessed about the VHS tapes.

39:24.830 --> 39:29.499
- Sure but there's more
to life than tapes right?

39:32.003 --> 39:32.936
- Of course.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.575
So what is it that you do?

39:39.411 --> 39:40.844
Tommy never told me.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.912
- [Carrie] I'm an assistant
editor at Razor Comics.

39:42.914 --> 39:44.914
- Oh, what does an assistant
editor do?

39:44.916 --> 39:47.550
- [Carrie] Oh well I work with
the writer

39:47.552 --> 39:48.918
and the artist to tell the
story.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.854
Check things like spelling and
grammar

39:50.856 --> 39:53.022
and then you gotta check the
pages

39:53.024 --> 39:55.458
to make sure the artist didn't
hide any dicks in there.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.727
- Does that happen often?

39:58.897 --> 40:00.930
- No, no I'm just kidding.

40:03.602 --> 40:04.534
- Oh.

40:05.604 --> 40:06.536
Cool.

40:07.139 --> 40:12.409
- [Carrie] It's fun.

40:13.512 --> 40:16.646
- I've been meaning to ask you.

40:16.648 --> 40:17.514
The tape.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.181
How did you get the tape?

40:18.183 --> 40:19.482
The Black Moon.

40:19.484 --> 40:20.884
Did you win that auction?

40:20.886 --> 40:22.986
- No, that was insane.

40:22.988 --> 40:24.271
I mean crazy.

40:24.272 --> 40:25.555
Who pays that much for a tape?

40:25.557 --> 40:28.725
No, I was actually looking
for a replacement VCR

40:28.727 --> 40:31.761
at a stoop sale in Brooklyn
and there was this blue tub,

40:31.763 --> 40:34.697
and I go in and I start
sifting through all these tapes

40:34.699 --> 40:36.766
and of course it's all these old
pornos,

40:36.768 --> 40:38.735
but then just like right in the
middle,

40:38.737 --> 40:39.936
Beneath the Black Moon.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.806
- [Jennifer] So there's
just a box of porn sitting

40:42.808 --> 40:44.207
on a stoop in Brooklyn?

40:44.209 --> 40:46.476
- No, no I bought that.

40:46.478 --> 40:47.210
No, I bought the porn.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.945
I know some collectors for that.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.048
- You?

40:52.050 --> 40:52.982
- No, no.

40:54.619 --> 40:57.020
(soft music)

41:02.494 --> 41:04.528
- What are you guys talking
about?

41:04.529 --> 41:06.563
- Hey, I was just telling
Jennifer about

41:06.565 --> 41:08.198
how I found Beneath the Black
Moon.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.166
- [Tommy] Oh wow crazy
luck finding that, huh?

41:10.168 --> 41:11.100
- Yeah.

41:16.975 --> 41:21.678
- So are we gonna watch
something?

41:21.680 --> 41:22.545
- Yes.

41:22.547 --> 41:23.213
Bill and Ted.

41:23.215 --> 41:24.747
- [Carrie] Oh hell yes.

41:24.749 --> 41:25.748
- Let's go.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.040
- [Lesley] She's the cute one,
right?

41:39.041 --> 41:40.285
- [Andrea] Maybe we should just
go home.

41:40.286 --> 41:41.530
- [Lesley] No, she's the
one you were talking about.

41:41.533 --> 41:42.699
Carrie?

41:42.700 --> 41:43.866
- [Jennifer] Yeah, but it's not
like that.

41:43.867 --> 41:45.033
- [Lesley] He can't just.

41:45.036 --> 41:46.227
What?

41:46.228 --> 41:47.419
- [Andrea] Why are you getting
so upset?

41:47.420 --> 41:48.611
She's not upset.

41:48.612 --> 41:49.803
- [Lesley] I am sick of Tommy
and his distance bullshit.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.107
- [Jennifer] I'm used to it.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.809
- [Lesley] She's used to it.

41:52.810 --> 41:54.510
Well, she shouldn't have
to be fucking used to it.

41:54.513 --> 41:56.012
- [Jennifer] What am I supposed
to do?

41:56.014 --> 41:57.213
- [Lesley] Move out.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.465
- [Jennifer] Where?

41:58.466 --> 41:59.716
It's not like I have a steady
income.

41:59.718 --> 42:02.085
- [Lesley] You can stay with us.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.154
- She can?

42:04.155 --> 42:05.255
- Yeah, she can sleep on the
couch.

42:05.257 --> 42:06.923
You can sleep on the couch.

42:06.925 --> 42:08.858
Just until you have shit figured
out.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.593
Tommy is just he's bad for you

42:10.595 --> 42:12.195
and you need to get away from
him.

42:12.197 --> 42:13.630
- I don't wanna impose.

42:14.266 --> 42:16.065
- It wouldn't be an imposition
at all.

42:16.067 --> 42:18.034
Just let us help you.

42:21.940 --> 42:22.839
- Yeah.

42:22.841 --> 42:23.773
- Yeah?

42:25.043 --> 42:25.975
Okay then.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.013
- What am I supposed to tell
him?

42:31.883 --> 42:34.717
(soft music)

42:34.719 --> 42:37.053
- Is there any way that
I could ever thank you

42:37.055 --> 42:39.856
for everything that you've done
for me?

42:40.692 --> 42:41.624
- Well.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.163
- [Jennifer] I'm going to bed.

42:47.165 --> 42:48.231
- [Tommy] Goodnight.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.298
- [Terry] It's not what it looks
like.

42:49.301 --> 42:50.900
- [Jennifer] Did you want to?

42:53.605 --> 42:55.638
- [Tommy] What?

42:55.640 --> 42:57.106
- [Jennifer] Never mind.

42:57.108 --> 42:58.041
- [Diana] In her mouth!?!

42:59.277 --> 43:01.210
- I've already told you what I
think.

43:02.647 --> 43:04.247
- You've never liked Tommy.

43:04.249 --> 43:06.216
- That's not true.

43:06.217 --> 43:08.184
I'm more indifferent to
Tommy than anything else.

43:08.186 --> 43:11.220
- Thank you for listening to my
bullshit.

43:12.257 --> 43:13.957
- Thanks for listening to mine.

43:15.827 --> 43:17.293
- I don't really listen.

43:17.295 --> 43:18.628
- Oh.

43:18.630 --> 43:19.362
Fuck you then.

43:25.303 --> 43:27.604
- [Wotan] Skald Lager from Wotan
Brewing.

43:27.606 --> 43:29.906
Cool, crisp, refreshing.

43:29.908 --> 43:32.942
A recipe that has been
unchanged for almost a century.

43:34.079 --> 43:35.845
A beer worthy of the gods.

43:37.082 --> 43:40.350
But I suppose all lagers are the
same.

43:48.059 --> 43:49.993
- Hey, you gonna come to bed?

44:06.778 --> 44:08.845
(bright music)

44:08.847 --> 44:12.215
- On second thought, I'll have
a Wotan Skald Lager instead.

44:14.653 --> 44:16.119
- [Wotan] Get some inspiration.

44:23.361 --> 44:24.327
- Are you awake?

44:26.865 --> 44:27.930
- What's up?

44:30.902 --> 44:33.302
- I think I'm gonna move out.

44:42.414 --> 44:43.346
- Okay.

44:44.916 --> 44:47.183
- It's not that I don't love
you.

44:47.185 --> 44:48.351
I do.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.920
It's just that this isn't
working.

44:59.998 --> 45:00.930
- I know.

45:00.932 --> 45:04.100
- [Jennifer] What happened to
us?

45:04.102 --> 45:06.769
It used to be good, didn't it?

45:08.206 --> 45:10.873
- I don't know.

45:10.875 --> 45:11.808
- I'm trying.

45:12.844 --> 45:15.344
I really have been trying.

45:15.346 --> 45:16.746
- I know you have.

45:18.083 --> 45:19.949
- And what about you?

45:22.420 --> 45:24.220
- Hasn't been working out for
me.

45:26.191 --> 45:27.423
- [Jennifer] For how long?

45:28.326 --> 45:29.792
- Long time.

45:29.794 --> 45:31.494
- Why didn't you say anything?

45:31.496 --> 45:36.766
- I don't know.

45:38.203 --> 45:39.219
I don't know.

45:39.220 --> 45:40.236
I mean, I thought it was normal.

45:41.372 --> 45:43.106
I thought I'd get over it.

45:43.107 --> 45:44.841
I didn't wanna hurt your
feelings.

45:44.843 --> 45:45.775
- Thanks.

45:50.849 --> 45:51.981
- I slept with Carrie.

46:00.158 --> 46:01.090
- When?

46:02.527 --> 46:03.793
- Last week.

46:05.163 --> 46:07.029
When you were at Lesley's.

46:08.032 --> 46:08.965
- Here?

46:12.237 --> 46:13.503
- [Tommy] Yeah.

46:16.441 --> 46:17.373
- Why her?

46:22.480 --> 46:23.946
- I don't know.

46:25.984 --> 46:29.919
- I have been trying to get
you to fuck me for months.

46:30.922 --> 46:32.488
- I wasn't interested.

46:32.490 --> 46:34.457
- But you were interested in
her?

46:34.459 --> 46:37.293
What, is there something wrong
with me?

46:37.295 --> 46:39.162
- No, there's nothing wrong with
you.

46:40.098 --> 46:41.397
- And in our bed.

46:46.337 --> 46:47.837
- [Tommy] I'm sorry.

46:47.838 --> 46:49.338
- You couldn't have
broken up with me first?

46:51.810 --> 46:56.078
- I guess, it's not like I
planned it.

46:59.484 --> 47:02.018
- All I wanted was you and I
would've

47:02.020 --> 47:03.586
given you anything that you
wanted

47:03.588 --> 47:06.022
and you go and you fuck
some video nerd slut.

47:06.024 --> 47:07.423
- [Tommy] She's not a slut.

47:07.425 --> 47:09.125
- Like I give a fuck.

47:10.028 --> 47:12.228
Why didn't you just talk to me?

47:15.466 --> 47:17.600
- Jen, it's been such a long
time with us.

47:17.602 --> 47:19.435
- [Jennifer] So it's
easier to just fuck around

47:19.437 --> 47:21.070
than to be an adult?

47:21.072 --> 47:24.240
Easier than to just be a man
and tell me how you feel?

47:27.312 --> 47:28.244
- Yes.

47:31.049 --> 47:32.215
Oh just, don't go.

47:32.217 --> 47:34.300
I'll go sleep on the couch.

47:34.301 --> 47:36.384
- No I don't want to sleep on
this bed.

47:40.291 --> 47:42.892
(soft music)

48:24.002 --> 48:26.602
- [Craig] The universe
is a computer program

48:26.604 --> 48:29.038
describing the universe.

48:29.040 --> 48:31.574
- [Danielle] The universe is
real.

48:33.144 --> 48:35.111
- Describing the universe.

48:35.113 --> 48:37.346
- But what we think the universe
is

48:37.348 --> 48:39.649
is not what the universe is.

48:39.651 --> 48:41.984
- To the subatomic level.

48:44.289 --> 48:47.156
(bright music)

48:47.158 --> 48:48.524
Sort of.

48:48.526 --> 48:51.994
- It's how we interpret the
information.

48:53.231 --> 48:55.965
(bright music)

48:57.101 --> 48:58.634
- Okay the universe.

48:59.470 --> 49:01.237
The program that describes it.

49:01.239 --> 49:02.571
- It's just information.

49:02.573 --> 49:06.609
- It's actually embedded
in another program.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.144
- Information.

49:08.146 --> 49:09.211
- In another program.

49:09.213 --> 49:11.080
- Interacting with other
information.

49:11.082 --> 49:13.215
- To the subatomic level.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.252
Into another program.

49:16.254 --> 49:17.954
- Creating more information.

49:17.956 --> 49:20.156
- This goes on until get to
the simplest of these programs.

49:20.158 --> 49:22.191
- Creating more information.

49:22.193 --> 49:24.727
(bright music)

49:28.733 --> 49:32.401
- All the way down to the
subatomic level.

49:36.407 --> 49:40.409
A program describing all
the possible outcomes.

49:42.113 --> 49:44.113
To the subatomic level.

49:47.418 --> 49:50.152
(bright music)

49:56.060 --> 49:59.528
- The universe is real but
what we think the universe is,

49:59.530 --> 50:01.597
isn't what the universe is.

50:01.599 --> 50:03.199
It's just information.

50:03.201 --> 50:05.634
Information interacting
with other information.

50:05.636 --> 50:08.070
Creating more information.

50:08.072 --> 50:11.507
Information interacting
with other information.

50:11.509 --> 50:14.176
Creating more information.

50:14.178 --> 50:17.346
Information interacting
with other information.

50:17.348 --> 50:21.484
It's how we interpret the
information.

50:21.486 --> 50:24.220
(bright music)

50:26.624 --> 50:28.391
(VCR Stop Click)

50:39.303 --> 50:41.337
- Do you need a hand?

50:41.339 --> 50:42.371
- No, we're okay.

50:43.174 --> 50:44.106
- Okay.

50:47.078 --> 50:50.379
- She's pissed at me.

50:50.381 --> 50:51.747
- No, she's pissed at me.

50:51.749 --> 50:52.615
It's fine really.

50:52.617 --> 50:53.716
Don't worry about it.

50:53.718 --> 50:54.583
- Sorry.

50:54.585 --> 50:56.241
- It's fine.

50:56.242 --> 50:57.898
- No, I'm gonna find
another arrangement soon.

50:57.899 --> 50:59.555
- And I'm your best friend
in the whole wide world

50:59.557 --> 51:01.090
and I'll do anything for you.

51:01.092 --> 51:02.658
Blah blah blah.

51:02.659 --> 51:04.225
Just shut the fuck up about it.

51:04.228 --> 51:06.195
Get the rest of your
boxes out of the rental.

51:06.197 --> 51:07.263
- I'm sorry.

51:08.433 --> 51:09.498
- It's fine.

51:18.309 --> 51:20.709
(soft music)

51:22.146 --> 51:24.413
- Hi.

51:24.414 --> 51:26.681
- Hey, is this Andrea and
Lesley's place?

51:26.684 --> 51:29.385
- Yeah, what are you doing here?

51:29.387 --> 51:32.088
- I'm here for the anniversary
dinner.

51:32.090 --> 51:33.456
Shit, is it not tonight?

51:33.458 --> 51:34.490
- No, it is.

51:34.492 --> 51:37.326
Don't you work for Carter-Cord?

51:37.328 --> 51:39.628
- Yes, I'm one of the office
drones there.

51:39.630 --> 51:40.796
- [Jennifer] We've met.

51:42.166 --> 51:43.799
- Oh right.

51:43.801 --> 51:45.401
You're the designer.

51:45.403 --> 51:46.769
- Yes.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.136
It's weird meeting you here.

51:48.139 --> 51:49.638
- I went to school with Andrea.

51:50.741 --> 51:52.091
- Come on in.

51:52.092 --> 51:53.442
We're just hanging out and
chatting.

51:56.247 --> 51:57.546
- How do you know them?

51:57.548 --> 51:58.848
- Lesley's my best friend.

51:58.850 --> 52:01.684
I'm kind of crashing here right
now.

52:01.686 --> 52:03.686
- Oh you're the one.

52:03.688 --> 52:04.620
- The one?

52:05.723 --> 52:07.556
- Oh, just Andrea mentioned one

52:07.558 --> 52:09.692
of Lesley's friends was staying.

52:09.694 --> 52:12.228
Your boyfriend kicked
you out or something?

52:12.897 --> 52:14.130
- I left him.

52:14.799 --> 52:16.365
Do you need a drink?

52:16.367 --> 52:17.633
I need a drink.

52:24.442 --> 52:27.176
(mellow music)

52:31.883 --> 52:34.216
- [Wotan] Skald Lager from Wotan
Brewing.

52:34.218 --> 52:36.318
Inspiration for a better life.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.787
- So how long have you
worked for Carter Cord?

52:38.789 --> 52:40.156
- Just a year.

52:40.158 --> 52:41.457
- What's it like?

52:41.459 --> 52:43.425
- I don't really wanna talk
about work.

53:02.580 --> 53:03.445
- [Lesley] We're going out to
brunch.

53:03.447 --> 53:04.380
You wanna come?

53:06.684 --> 53:08.417
- You've been hitting that
pretty hard.

53:08.419 --> 53:09.518
- It's good.

53:09.520 --> 53:10.386
- Not that good.

53:10.388 --> 53:11.320
- I like it.

53:16.194 --> 53:16.843
I don't feel so good.

53:16.844 --> 53:17.493
- Well, maybe you shouldn't
drink two

53:17.495 --> 53:19.461
and half bottles of wine.

53:19.463 --> 53:21.330
- Yeah, maybe you like it too
much.

53:25.336 --> 53:27.503
- [Jennifer] Who asked you?

53:27.505 --> 53:30.773
- [Lee] Maybe you should
cut back a little bit.

53:31.809 --> 53:33.409
- I'm fine.

53:33.411 --> 53:34.343
Okay?

53:35.279 --> 53:37.479
I don't need your approval.

53:37.481 --> 53:39.064
Jesus.

53:39.065 --> 53:40.648
Who the fuck do you think you
are?

53:41.953 --> 53:43.419
- Don't lie here all day.

53:44.288 --> 53:45.221
- Sure.

53:46.791 --> 53:48.457
- I'm gonna go.

53:48.459 --> 53:49.391
Nice seeing you.

53:58.569 --> 53:59.468
- What's going on?

53:59.470 --> 54:00.402
- It's good wine.

54:01.739 --> 54:02.738
- You think maybe you've had
enough?

54:02.740 --> 54:03.672
- Not really.

54:05.476 --> 54:07.676
(soft music)

54:07.678 --> 54:08.611
Sorry.

54:20.558 --> 54:21.724
- Fine.

54:21.726 --> 54:22.858
Go out and take a walk.

54:22.860 --> 54:24.727
It'll help clear your head
alright.

54:30.968 --> 54:31.900
- Sure.

54:33.671 --> 54:35.671
- [Lesley] All right, we'll see
you later.

54:43.614 --> 54:45.981
(dissonant music)

54:48.786 --> 54:51.520
(bright music)

54:58.529 --> 55:00.462
- [Wotan] Skald Lager from Wotan
Brewing.

55:00.464 --> 55:01.930
Inspiration for a better life.

55:16.781 --> 55:17.713
- [Kyle] Jen?

55:19.917 --> 55:21.350
- [Jennifer] Hey Kyle.

55:21.352 --> 55:22.985
What are you doing out here?

55:22.987 --> 55:24.720
- Going to see my girlfriend.

55:24.722 --> 55:26.388
- You have a girlfriend?

55:26.390 --> 55:27.623
- [Kyle] Yeah.

55:27.625 --> 55:30.559
- Sorry, that came out wrong.

55:30.561 --> 55:32.328
Course you do.

55:32.330 --> 55:33.996
It just, never came up.

55:34.832 --> 55:35.798
- Probably didn't.

55:36.801 --> 55:37.866
Heard you moved out.

55:39.737 --> 55:40.836
- Yeah well.

55:43.808 --> 55:45.407
- [Kyle] Sorry.

55:45.409 --> 55:46.775
- It's for the best.

55:47.812 --> 55:51.046
- Listen, I had absolutely no
idea.

55:56.487 --> 55:57.820
- [Carrie] Alright it's a date.

55:57.822 --> 55:59.755
- Yeah well, neither did I.

56:01.492 --> 56:03.559
- [Kyle] How you doing?

56:03.561 --> 56:05.861
- Have a little bit of a
hangover.

56:05.863 --> 56:07.796
- Need a little hair of the dog?

56:07.798 --> 56:10.032
- I think I need the whole dog.

56:10.034 --> 56:10.899
- [Kyle] Oh man.

56:10.901 --> 56:11.767
That sounds really bad.

56:11.769 --> 56:13.369
- Yeah, it's not great.

56:15.873 --> 56:17.539
- [Kyle] See you later maybe.

56:17.541 --> 56:18.774
- [Jennifer] Maybe yeah.

56:26.717 --> 56:27.950
- Dude, she okay?

56:29.053 --> 56:31.453
- Yeah, I think she'll be fine.

56:31.455 --> 56:33.856
(soft music)

57:06.857 --> 57:08.557
- [Bartender] You're cut off.

57:08.559 --> 57:09.491
- [Jennifer] Come on.

57:09.493 --> 57:11.059
Just one more.

57:11.061 --> 57:12.761
- [Bartender] You need to slow
down.

57:21.705 --> 57:22.638
- Hey.

57:23.707 --> 57:26.442
(upbeat music)

57:29.780 --> 57:31.079
I'm attractive.

57:33.217 --> 57:34.149
- Yeah?

57:35.186 --> 57:36.685
- Well I'm good to go.

57:36.687 --> 57:41.757
I'm a sexually liberated,
vibrant woman.

57:41.992 --> 57:44.526
- It's how we interpret the
information.

57:45.162 --> 57:48.497
- That result in order to be
understand.

57:48.499 --> 57:49.598
- [Danielle] The universe is
real.

57:49.600 --> 57:50.532
- [Tommy] Again?

57:51.735 --> 57:54.069
- I found this woman online
today.

57:54.071 --> 57:55.504
- [Danielle] But what we
think the universe is,

57:55.506 --> 57:56.605
isn't what the universe is.

57:58.075 --> 57:59.158
- [Tommy] Does she have any idea

57:59.159 --> 58:00.242
who might've made the tape?

58:00.244 --> 58:01.610
- Maybe.

58:01.612 --> 58:02.544
Hopefully.

58:05.950 --> 58:06.882
Come on.

58:06.884 --> 58:10.085
You're coming home with yours
truly.

58:10.087 --> 58:11.687
- [Danielle] The universe is
real.

58:11.689 --> 58:13.822
- You know I think kind of this
thing

58:13.824 --> 58:16.658
we heard about in anthrop class.

58:16.660 --> 58:18.594
It was called dreaming time.

58:18.596 --> 58:20.028
Dream time.

58:20.030 --> 58:21.497
It's Australian I think.

58:21.499 --> 58:22.231
- What is it?

58:25.669 --> 58:28.737
Oh watch out over here.

58:29.673 --> 58:30.606
Do you have?

58:31.509 --> 58:32.941
I think I have one.

58:32.943 --> 58:35.577
Maybe I can borrow one from
Lesley.

58:35.579 --> 58:36.645
- [Joe] Who?

58:41.218 --> 58:44.019
- It's this idea that
our world is parallel

58:44.021 --> 58:47.022
to this other place and over
there you have these archetypes

58:47.024 --> 58:51.293
that exist in the real world,
our world.

58:51.295 --> 58:53.795
- [Jennifer] Come on, take off
your pants.

58:53.797 --> 58:55.664
Do you have a condom?

58:56.700 --> 58:57.699
It's okay.

58:57.701 --> 58:58.667
I can get one.

58:58.669 --> 58:59.935
Don't worry.

58:59.937 --> 59:02.538
(soft music)

59:03.941 --> 59:05.574
- It's like everyone who's ever
lived

59:05.576 --> 59:07.876
or ever will live already
exists over there.

59:08.746 --> 59:10.913
Our world is just a shadow of
dream time.

59:12.850 --> 59:13.715
- [Lesley] What are you doing
here?

59:13.717 --> 59:15.751
- [Joe] She fell asleep.

59:15.753 --> 59:16.885
- Who are you are?

59:16.887 --> 59:17.886
- [Joe] I'm Joe.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.254
I was just at the bar.

59:20.558 --> 59:22.208
- You should go.

59:22.209 --> 59:23.859
- [Joe] Yeah, is she gonna be
alright?

59:23.861 --> 59:24.793
- Just go.

59:28.299 --> 59:29.965
- Something like that.

59:29.966 --> 59:31.632
- I'm not sure if that's
exactly what she's saying.

59:31.635 --> 59:33.101
- You okay?

59:33.103 --> 59:34.836
- Hey.

59:34.838 --> 59:35.904
- Are you okay?

59:35.906 --> 59:37.139
- I don't feel so great.

59:38.776 --> 59:41.176
(soft music)

59:45.883 --> 59:48.083
- [Lesley] Rise and shine.

59:49.253 --> 59:50.819
- I don't feel like shining.

59:50.821 --> 59:52.921
- I gotta go to work but we need
to talk.

59:53.958 --> 59:56.091
- [Jennifer] You said it was
Australian?

59:56.093 --> 59:57.593
- Yeah, Australian or African.

59:57.595 --> 59:58.677
Something like that.

59:58.678 --> 59:59.760
It's been awhile since class.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:03.031
- Hey, you wanna watch
something?

01:00:04.635 --> 01:00:06.234
- [Lesley] Do you remember last
night?

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:11.206
- Did I get laid?

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.140
- [Lesley] No.

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:15.344
- [Tommy] I was just about to go
check out

01:00:15.346 --> 01:00:16.945
that auction and then crash.

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:18.747
- Okay.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:25.721
- I made you coffee.

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:28.690
- You are my hero.

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:36.932
- Later we need to talk.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.302
- I'm sorry.

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:42.904
It won't happen again.

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:45.140
- I'll see you later.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:52.914
(soft music)

01:01:08.399 --> 01:01:09.782
- I'm sorry.

01:01:09.783 --> 01:01:11.166
They're both stuck in another
meeting.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:12.034
- [Jennifer] Both of them?

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:13.301
Neither can get away?

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:14.236
- Sorry.

01:01:15.205 --> 01:01:16.805
- [Jennifer] I can wait.

01:01:16.807 --> 01:01:19.174
- There's another meeting
in here in 10 minutes.

01:01:23.447 --> 01:01:24.379
- Fine.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:28.784
(Alka Seltzer Fizzing)

01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:33.288
Hey guys.

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:35.090
- [Lesley] Hey.

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:36.258
Where you've been?

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:37.459
- You don't own a VCR.

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:41.897
- I didn't know we needed one.

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:44.700
- Oh, I was just gonna
watch the tape again.

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.068
- Did you go anywhere else?

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.236
- [Jennifer] No.

01:01:49.973 --> 01:01:50.972
- Please sit down.

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:54.276
- [Jennifer] Is this about last
night?

01:01:58.115 --> 01:01:59.948
- It's about more than last
night.

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:02.417
It's been going on for awhile.

01:02:04.755 --> 01:02:07.189
- Yeah, I've been kind
of overdoing it lately.

01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:08.323
- [Lesley] Yeah a lot.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.792
Are you okay?

01:02:10.794 --> 01:02:14.730
- I don't think that I've
been okay for a long time.

01:02:15.966 --> 01:02:17.799
- Everybody gets low sometimes

01:02:17.801 --> 01:02:20.869
and sometimes we do things
to make ourselves feel better

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:21.937
that aren't so good.

01:02:21.939 --> 01:02:22.871
- Exactly.

01:02:22.873 --> 01:02:27.209
You remember sophomore
year of college how I was?

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:29.778
I wasn't eating and you
helped me with that.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:33.949
- Almost my entire first year
of law school I was on coke.

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:37.219
I had to go to rehab instead
of my summer internship.

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:38.920
- We're just worried about you.

01:02:39.823 --> 01:02:41.223
- You're right.

01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:42.290
I know you're right.

01:02:44.528 --> 01:02:45.994
- Promise me you'll quit.

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:48.130
Doesn't have to be forever.

01:02:48.132 --> 01:02:50.999
Just a month.

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:54.469
Are you okay?

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.040
(soft music)

01:03:08.418 --> 01:03:10.051
- This invoice is out of the
question.

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:11.920
- Absolutely out of the
question.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.889
- You're charging us for your
mistakes.

01:03:13.891 --> 01:03:15.323
- I'm not.

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:16.925
This was in the contract.

01:03:16.927 --> 01:03:18.393
You went out of scope.

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:20.295
I told you you were going out of
scope

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.464
and the contract says
that you pay for that.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:25.033
- I don't see why we're
getting penalized by you

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:26.935
for the mistakes that you made.

01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:30.038
- We're not going to pay
this until it's corrected.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:32.274
- I have to go to another
meeting.

01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:34.276
- We're too busy to be dealing
with this.

01:03:34.278 --> 01:03:36.077
Fix the invoice if you want to
get paid.

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:36.962
- Where are you going?

01:03:36.963 --> 01:03:37.846
We're in the middle of a
meeting.

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:39.915
You can't just leave.

01:03:39.917 --> 01:03:40.849
- [Marcus] Fix it.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:47.255
- Miss.

01:03:49.026 --> 01:03:52.494
- I'm not leaving until
this invoice is paid.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:55.030
- There's another meeting
in here right now.

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:59.968
(soft music)

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.149
- [Danielle] Sure you don't want
any?

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:16.051
- No thanks.

01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:19.487
I'm abstaining for awhile.

01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:24.960
- I didn't make this smashup
tape that you're talking about.

01:04:26.163 --> 01:04:27.329
- Yeah, I know.

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:29.431
I was hoping that you might know
who did.

01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:36.938
- Does it change based on who
made it?

01:04:37.975 --> 01:04:40.008
- [Jennifer] Think that it
might make a difference.

01:04:40.644 --> 01:04:43.545
- Have you heard of the
holographic principle?

01:04:44.648 --> 01:04:48.950
See, a three dimensional
object can be described

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:53.188
by the two dimensional
information
encoded at its boundary.

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:57.459
The theory came about from
observations of black holes.

01:04:57.461 --> 01:05:00.462
Then someone said what
if this theory applies

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:02.130
to the whole universe as well?

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:05.100
- This is what you were
talking about on the video.

01:05:05.102 --> 01:05:06.502
- Right.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:07.903
The holographic principle is a
theory

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:12.274
that the whole universe is a
three dimensional projection

01:05:12.276 --> 01:05:15.377
of two dimensional
information at its border.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:17.045
It's an illusion.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:19.514
It's how we interpret the
information.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.285
- So this is the theory that
everything

01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:25.253
that we see is not real.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.222
- Well the universe is real.

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:29.391
It isn't what we think it is.

01:05:29.393 --> 01:05:31.526
It's just information.

01:05:31.528 --> 01:05:34.629
Information at the border
describing it.

01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:41.636
- So we are all information
that think that we're people?

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.607
- People are just information.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:48.310
Information interacting with
information

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:50.445
and creating more information.

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.617
- So do you think that this
is what the tape was about?

01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:58.053
- No.

01:05:58.055 --> 01:06:00.956
I think this is what the tape
is.

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:04.526
It's just information that
reveals more information.

01:06:05.996 --> 01:06:07.295
Maybe.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:09.531
If the theory is right.

01:06:10.334 --> 01:06:11.399
It's just information.

01:06:11.401 --> 01:06:13.735
No matter or energy.

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:15.370
Just information.

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:17.072
- [Jennifer] So what does it
have to do

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:18.273
with the original tape?

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:22.410
- Does the piece of information

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:27.382
that created the piece of
information, that is the tape,

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:33.989
influence the way that you,
also a piece of information,

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:37.625
see that piece of
information that is the tape?

01:06:37.627 --> 01:06:40.261
Does knowing change the way you
see it?

01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:44.666
- Maybe.

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:48.670
I suppose I would need that
information to find out.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.542
- Unfortunately I can't
help you with that.

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:57.312
I recorded it for some science
web series.

01:06:57.314 --> 01:06:59.180
I don't even know how
they got off the internet

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:01.216
and on to some video tape.

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:02.617
- Yeah.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:03.518
- Sorry.

01:07:05.055 --> 01:07:08.089
Why are you so worried
about who made the tape?

01:07:09.092 --> 01:07:11.026
- Just a side project.

01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:13.094
A hobby really.

01:07:13.096 --> 01:07:16.698
I just wanna learn more about
why someone would make this.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:20.335
- What would you do if
you met this person?

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.605
- Ask them what the tape meant.

01:07:23.607 --> 01:07:24.856
- [Danielle] What could they
tell you

01:07:24.857 --> 01:07:26.106
that's not already on the tape?

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:28.076
- I don't know.

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:31.312
- Why did he put you together

01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:34.582
with this whole digital physics
thing?

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.684
I mean, what's the point?

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:40.588
And why did he put it on VHS?

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:45.160
- [Danielle] What would you
get out of learning all that?

01:07:45.162 --> 01:07:46.327
- Satisfy curiosity.

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:48.696
- And then what?

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:51.332
- [Jennifer] I do something
else.

01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:52.534
- Like what?

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:55.470
Find another tape?

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:57.772
Find the creator of that tape?

01:07:57.774 --> 01:07:59.274
- No, I don't know.

01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:01.109
Maybe make my own tape.

01:08:02.379 --> 01:08:04.245
- That's interesting.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.213
- [Jennifer] What?

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:07.849
- You want to make one of your
own.

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:12.220
- [Jennifer] Yeah well I don't
know what it would be about.

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:13.655
- But you want to make one.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.492
- Maybe.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.029
I suppose.

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:23.296
I just I haven't really
thought about it seriously.

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:26.234
- [Danielle] Why are you
waiting to find the creator

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:27.402
of this tape to do it?

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:33.508
(soft music)

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:17.152
- [Lesley] Hey, what are you up
to?

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:17.886
- Hey.

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:20.755
I'm just trying something.

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:23.073
- [Lesley] You know most people

01:09:23.075 --> 01:09:24.358
only watch one movie at a time?

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:28.595
- I had an interesting
conversation yesterday.

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:30.365
- [Lesley] Oh yeah.

01:09:30.367 --> 01:09:31.899
Oh with that girl from the tape?

01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:33.835
- Yeah.

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.769
She just suggested that
make something of my own.

01:09:35.772 --> 01:09:37.438
- [Lesley] So what's all this?

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.606
- I'm trying it.

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:39.506
- [Lesley] Any luck?

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:40.441
- Not yet.

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:45.613
- You know some people make
videos on a computer nowadays?

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:47.448
- Ah computers that's absurd.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.683
They're only good for watching
pizza

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.385
and ordering pornography.

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:52.319
- So you wanted to stick with
analog?

01:09:52.322 --> 01:09:53.421
- I don't know.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:54.355
Maybe.

01:09:55.959 --> 01:09:58.293
- I really want a pizza now.

01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:00.528
- That is the best idea.

01:10:01.932 --> 01:10:03.198
- Pizza and a movie?

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:05.333
- Yes.

01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:06.267
So much yes.

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:09.921
- Not pornography.

01:10:09.922 --> 01:10:12.406
- Ah well then I don't know
what the hell we're gonna watch.

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:14.809
(soft music)

01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:25.553
- [Tommy] Hey.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:29.390
- Hey.

01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:32.493
- What are you doing here?

01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:36.531
- Looking at tapes.

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:40.368
- Hey Tommy.

01:10:44.274 --> 01:10:45.006
Oh.

01:10:47.944 --> 01:10:48.876
Hi.

01:10:51.448 --> 01:10:52.480
- Carrie.

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:55.717
- Hey.

01:10:59.456 --> 01:11:00.639
- It's fine.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.823
I'm just here looking at tapes.

01:11:04.628 --> 01:11:05.560
- Cool.

01:11:08.265 --> 01:11:11.566
So, Ben found us a place in
Queens.

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:13.334
- That is cool.

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:14.936
Can you give me a second?

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.037
I'll be out.

01:11:16.039 --> 01:11:16.971
- Sure.

01:11:21.478 --> 01:11:23.478
- Did you ever find that
guy who made that tape?

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:26.514
- No.

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:28.049
Not really.

01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:29.651
Kind of onto something new.

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:32.754
- [Tommy] Okay.

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.622
- I think that I might
try to make my own video.

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:37.358
- Mashup tape.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.694
- [Jennifer] I don't know.

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:41.062
- Okay.

01:11:41.064 --> 01:11:42.864
Well whatever you make, let me
know okay,

01:11:42.866 --> 01:11:45.466
'cause I'd like to see it
sometime.

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:50.438
- Thanks.

01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:53.341
- Jen, it was nice to see you.

01:11:55.512 --> 01:11:56.444
Take care.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:11.993
(computer dialing)

01:12:22.072 --> 01:12:25.573
- That's not what the
contract we drew up said.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:26.841
- [Marcus] We also agreed on a
budget

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.710
and you went way, way over.

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:29.944
- You approved that.

01:12:29.946 --> 01:12:31.479
- Let's just wait for Carlos.

01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:33.114
He wanted to talk with
you about it as well.

01:12:33.116 --> 01:12:35.016
- You approved of going over the
budget

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.851
just like you approved of the
contract.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.087
- Let's just wait for Carlos.

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:46.060
- While we're waiting,
I just wanna apologize

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:47.595
for the other night.

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:48.529
- [Marcus] Oh.

01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:51.633
No need.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:54.135
- That's never happened to me
before.

01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:55.503
- I take it as a compliment.

01:12:55.505 --> 01:12:57.172
I really do.

01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:58.840
- [Larraine] I just made
such a mess everywhere.

01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:00.074
They were such nice sheets.

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:01.909
- Hey, if you're not making a
mess,

01:13:01.911 --> 01:13:03.578
you're not having any fun right,

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:07.148
and besides it came out in the
wash.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.383
- I'm so glad.

01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:13.955
- [Marcus] Perhaps we can
give it another go tonight.

01:13:14.858 --> 01:13:16.391
- Tonight's no good.

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:18.459
Carlos has a softball game.

01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:19.560
- [Marcus] Oh.

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:20.762
- Yeah.

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:22.630
- Maybe next week.

01:13:22.632 --> 01:13:26.701
I've got this new toy.

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:30.471
It's got an electrical current
that runs to different paths.

01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:31.806
Like on that website.

01:13:31.808 --> 01:13:33.441
You remember the website.

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:34.909
- Yeah, I don't know.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.644
I've never tried anything
like that before.

01:13:36.646 --> 01:13:38.546
- I'm sitting right here.

01:13:41.551 --> 01:13:43.651
- It's rude to eavesdrop.

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:46.421
- Good afternoon.

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:47.789
- Hey.

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:48.656
- How are the sheets?

01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:50.658
- Oh fine.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:51.793
Absolutely fine.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:53.027
- He was just telling me he got
one

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:56.764
of those electric toys like the
website.

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:59.467
- Can we deal with my invoice
please?

01:14:00.737 --> 01:14:01.669
- Of course.

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:08.943
I'm not sure I sure what
the problem here is.

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.112
We asked you to correct
some mistakes in the work.

01:14:11.114 --> 01:14:13.714
I'm not sure why you'd
charge us for your mistakes.

01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:15.767
- They weren't mistakes.

01:14:15.768 --> 01:14:17.819
They were changes that
your people requested.

01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:18.686
- Are they changes?

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:20.455
- They were mistakes.

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:21.990
- They were mistakes.

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:23.524
You're trying to charge
us for your errors.

01:14:23.526 --> 01:14:26.761
- Sorry we won't be gamed like
some of your other clients.

01:14:26.763 --> 01:14:29.063
I'm happy to pay the
appropriate price of the invoice

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:30.932
but not for your errors.

01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:32.900
- I did not make any errors.

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:35.503
The original submission was
exactly to specification

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:36.904
and I can prove that.

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:39.540
- What if we split the
difference

01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:40.975
and pay you half the invoice?

01:14:42.612 --> 01:14:44.579
- Hardly fair.

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:48.249
- Well, we might as well meet
her halfway

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:50.184
if she's gonna give us
such a hard time about it.

01:14:50.186 --> 01:14:51.953
- I don't want half of it.

01:14:51.955 --> 01:14:54.055
You need to pay the full amount.

01:14:54.057 --> 01:14:55.790
- That's not what we agreed.

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.692
You said they were your
mistakes.

01:14:57.694 --> 01:14:59.694
- I did no such thing.

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:00.895
- I'm not comfortable with this.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:02.797
If she's going to yell, I'm
leaving.

01:15:08.238 --> 01:15:10.204
- You need to calm down.

01:15:10.206 --> 01:15:11.689
- [Carlos] Do I need to call
security?

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:13.173
- No, you need to pay the damn
invoice.

01:15:13.176 --> 01:15:16.043
I have the agreements and
the amendments in writing.

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:18.613
I'll hire a lawyer and
file a suit if I have to.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:21.115
- Okay Miss.

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:24.051
We don't take kindly to threats.

01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:25.086
Rest assured.

01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:28.055
You won't be working here again.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:31.893
We will not be exploited again.

01:15:40.904 --> 01:15:42.803
- [Lesley] You're a fucking bad
ass.

01:15:44.173 --> 01:15:45.640
- It felt good.

01:15:45.642 --> 01:15:46.307
I feel good.

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:47.275
- That's awesome.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:50.111
I was thinking about some of the
stuff

01:15:50.113 --> 01:15:51.279
from the video earlier.

01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:55.216
Some of the stuff with like
the holographic universe.

01:15:55.218 --> 01:15:57.118
Kind of reminded me of Genesis.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.287
- Phil Collins or Peter Gabriel?

01:15:59.289 --> 01:16:00.655
- From the Bible.

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:02.757
I was in Bible study once in
college

01:16:02.759 --> 01:16:07.194
and they were talking about
how the word made everything.

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:10.798
You know like let there be
light and there was light.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:14.802
Let there be water and birds and
so on

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:19.674
it's like the entire world
was made from the word.

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:21.842
- That is very similar.

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:23.244
- [Lesley] Yeah.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:24.745
- That never occurred to me.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:27.748
Oh hey, I am going to
see the woman tomorrow.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.116
- [Lesley] Oh, you
finally nailed her down?

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:30.518
- Yeah.

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:31.919
Maybe she'll have more to say
about it.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:38.025
(soft music)

01:16:50.873 --> 01:16:52.173
- [Lesley] How's it going?

01:16:52.175 --> 01:16:53.207
- Awful.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:54.809
- [Lesley] What's wrong with it?

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:57.061
- I don't know.

01:16:57.062 --> 01:16:59.312
It's just I don't know which one
to use.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:01.115
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.150
- I mean it's an experiment.

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:04.785
You don't need to succeed.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:05.720
- I guess.

01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:08.789
- Why are you doing this
mashup thing anyway?

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.691
- It's just like the tape.

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:13.327
- Yeah but why?

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:17.732
I mean, why not go out and
shoot something different

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:19.033
all original or something?

01:17:20.303 --> 01:17:21.369
You're a graphic designer.

01:17:21.371 --> 01:17:22.970
Why not make that part of it?

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:26.273
You have an idea?

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:28.242
- Something.

01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:30.311
- Alright.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:32.079
I will leave you to it then.

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:37.918
(soft music)

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.972
- What do you think?

01:18:31.974 --> 01:18:33.441
- That's so great.

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:35.242
It's amazing.

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:39.847
- It's gonna be a fusion
of what you were talking

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:42.316
to me about and what I was
originally planning on doing.

01:18:42.318 --> 01:18:43.751
- How?

01:18:43.753 --> 01:18:45.870
- You'll see.

01:18:45.871 --> 01:18:47.988
I still have to record a voice
over and combine everything.

01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:50.975
- It's great.

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:52.225
I'm really looking forward to
seeing it.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:56.864
- I kind of want to show Tommy
first.

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:58.132
Is that weird?

01:18:59.736 --> 01:19:01.502
- You're not trying to get--

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:03.270
- No, no, no, no.

01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:04.338
That's not it.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.390
I'm past it.

01:19:06.391 --> 01:19:08.441
It's just he originally got
me the tape more or less

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:10.177
and it's kind of his thing,

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.880
and I ran into him a couple
weeks ago

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:15.850
and I told him about it
and he seemed interested.

01:19:15.852 --> 01:19:17.251
- You didn't tell me about that.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:18.219
- I know.

01:19:18.221 --> 01:19:19.754
I just you know.

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:23.491
Didn't want you to think I was
trying to get back with him.

01:19:24.494 --> 01:19:25.426
- Sure.

01:19:27.163 --> 01:19:29.430
- Do you think it's weird
that I wanna show Tommy first?

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:30.798
- No, I get it.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.799
- It's weird.

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:32.533
- Show him.

01:19:32.535 --> 01:19:35.302
Nothing else you'll be
showing him the genius

01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:37.371
he wasn't smart enough to stick
with.

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:41.475
- You're the best.

01:19:45.047 --> 01:19:46.814
(soft music)

01:19:46.816 --> 01:19:48.849
I didn't think that you
would be hiring me again.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:51.418
- [Man] I didn't say that.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.120
- [Larraine] Whatever gave you
that idea?

01:19:53.122 --> 01:19:55.222
- [Man] Our boss loved the
design you did.

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:56.423
- [Larraine] We loved the
design.

01:19:56.425 --> 01:19:57.291
- [Man] We loved it.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:58.425
Fantastic work.

01:19:59.228 --> 01:20:00.594
- I see.

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:01.961
- [Larraine] So we'd like to
bring you

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:03.164
onto this new project.

01:20:03.166 --> 01:20:04.832
- I see.

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:08.836
- [Man] Now we will have to
discuss your rate of course.

01:20:08.838 --> 01:20:11.839
- Oh well, I have been really
busy lately.

01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:14.341
I don't know if I can
take on another project.

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:15.910
- Well surely you can find time
for us.

01:20:15.912 --> 01:20:18.312
- I thought we made a fantastic
team.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:19.980
- Fantastic.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:23.017
- Well, I guess I could make the
time

01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:25.519
if we were to raise my rate by
25%.

01:20:27.023 --> 01:20:31.325
- Well, I don't know if we could
do that.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:33.093
- We should be able to manage
that.

01:20:33.095 --> 01:20:34.028
- We should?

01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:35.596
- I think so, yeah.

01:20:35.598 --> 01:20:37.298
- Yes, of course.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.850
Of course we should.

01:20:38.851 --> 01:20:40.401
You did such a great job with
the work.

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:42.169
- Really such a good job.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:45.573
- [Jennifer] Once upon a
time there was fisherman

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:49.043
who lived in a small
house by a small lake.

01:20:49.045 --> 01:20:51.345
The fisherman didn't mind the
smallness.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:53.214
He everything he needed.

01:20:53.216 --> 01:20:56.217
His boat, his home, his fishing
nets.

01:20:56.219 --> 01:21:00.020
The fisherman had everything
he needed and he was content.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:03.157
One evening as the fisherman
rode to shore

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:07.194
with his day's catch a fly
landed on one of the fish.

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:10.264
The fisherman raised his
hand to slap the fly away.

01:21:10.266 --> 01:21:13.968
The fly left the fish and
landed on the fisherman's nose.

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:16.003
Please sir said the fly.

01:21:16.005 --> 01:21:18.372
If you let me take a piece of
your fish,

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.274
I will give you a story.

01:21:20.276 --> 01:21:22.276
The fisherman was astonished,

01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:26.313
but the fly's words
reminded him he lived alone

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:29.416
and he was often starved for
company.

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:32.086
So he agreed to trade a piece of
fish

01:21:32.088 --> 01:21:33.888
for a story from the fly.

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:36.657
Once upon a time, began the fly,

01:21:36.659 --> 01:21:38.559
there was a fisherman who lived
alone

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:41.128
on an island in the stars.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.430
He spent his days sleeping on
his boat

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:47.101
and his nights maintaining the
faucet that filled his lake.

01:21:47.103 --> 01:21:51.138
One day he couldn't sleep and
he stared up at the faucet

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:54.475
wondering at what existed
beyond his island.

01:21:54.477 --> 01:21:57.444
What did the water from
the faucet come from?

01:21:58.514 --> 01:21:59.947
The fisherman fell asleep

01:21:59.949 --> 01:22:02.383
and dreamt of his eye leaving
his head

01:22:02.385 --> 01:22:05.920
and traveling through the
faucet to see the world.

01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:07.588
The eye bore witness to the
world

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:10.591
beyond the fisherman's
island in the stars.

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:12.960
It witnessed the horrors of war.

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:15.930
It marveled at the inventiveness
of games.

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:18.132
It learned from philosophers.

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:20.267
Felt what it was like
to belong with friends

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:23.938
and learned how to care and
be cared for from lovers.

01:22:24.607 --> 01:22:26.507
The eye then flew back to the
fisherman

01:22:26.509 --> 01:22:30.277
on his lonely island to share
all it witnessed with him

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:32.179
and from then on the fisherman
would

01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:35.649
send his eye out exploring
every day in his dreams.

01:22:36.986 --> 01:22:40.321
Tell me more about what the
eye saw, the fisherman begged.

01:22:40.323 --> 01:22:42.089
I will tell you that story for a
piece

01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:44.959
of your fish tomorrow said the
fly.

01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:46.627
The fisherman agreed and the fly

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:49.596
took his piece of fish and left.

01:22:49.598 --> 01:22:52.733
From then on every day the
fly would visit the fisherman

01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:56.136
and exchange stories of
what the exploring eye saw

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:58.105
for a piece of fish.

01:22:58.107 --> 01:23:02.176
In time, the fisherman and
the fly became great friends.

01:23:02.178 --> 01:23:05.179
The fisherman's small home
and small lake were larger

01:23:05.181 --> 01:23:07.614
for the stories the fly told
him.

01:23:07.616 --> 01:23:12.987
Then, one day the fly did
not show up for his fish.

01:23:12.989 --> 01:23:15.756
The next day there was no sign
of the fly.

01:23:15.758 --> 01:23:18.459
On the third day the
fisherman rode around his lake

01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:21.261
calling for his friend the fly.

01:23:21.263 --> 01:23:24.198
His lake and his house were
small again.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.166
He was alone again.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:28.736
He rode in circles
calling for his friend day

01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:31.205
and night for a week.

01:23:31.207 --> 01:23:33.340
Finally exhausted from the
search,

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:35.175
he fell asleep in his boat.

01:23:36.012 --> 01:23:39.213
Asleep in his boat, the
fisherman began to dream.

01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:41.382
He dreamt of all the things his
friend

01:23:41.384 --> 01:23:43.417
the fly had described to him.

01:23:43.419 --> 01:23:46.220
He dreamt of wars, playing
games,

01:23:46.222 --> 01:23:47.554
learning from philosophers,

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:50.691
and belonging with friends and
lovers.

01:23:50.693 --> 01:23:52.559
The fisherman was awakened from
his dreams

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:55.229
with a jolt when his boat hit
the shore.

01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:57.064
He looked around.

01:23:57.066 --> 01:24:00.401
He was on the opposite
shore from his house.

01:24:00.403 --> 01:24:02.669
He stepped out of his boat
to push it back in the water

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:04.605
and return home but stopped.

01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:08.275
He looked around the shore.

01:24:08.277 --> 01:24:11.045
It was different here than
where his small house sat.

01:24:12.081 --> 01:24:15.816
He pushed his boat into the
water and watched it float away.

01:24:17.086 --> 01:24:20.387
He turned to the shore
and began walking inland

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:24.158
to see the world his
friend had told him about.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.693
(bright music)

01:24:58.094 --> 01:25:03.163
¶ You and I are a special thing
¶

01:25:04.233 --> 01:25:09.303
¶ Your love and the bitterest of
stings ¶

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:12.840

¶ You and I ¶

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.853
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:25:25.855 --> 01:25:27.488
¶ Foolish pride ¶

01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:29.189
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:30.657
¶ Scared inside ¶

01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:32.426
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:25:32.428 --> 01:25:37.231
¶ Of everything counting stars ¶

01:25:37.233 --> 01:25:38.799
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:40.534
¶ Air guitars ¶

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:42.236
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:25:42.238 --> 01:25:43.670
¶ Need your smile ¶

01:25:43.672 --> 01:25:45.572
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:25:45.574 --> 01:25:50.644
¶ Shiny cars ¶

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:56.850
¶ Fast cars and even faster
girls ¶

01:25:58.254 --> 01:26:03.290
¶ Street lights reflected on the
world ¶

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:06.593
¶ Round and round ¶

01:26:06.595 --> 01:26:09.930
¶ We drove round ¶

01:26:09.932 --> 01:26:12.866
¶ 'Til every song ¶

01:26:12.868 --> 01:26:16.470
¶ All blends to one ¶

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:17.938
¶ You and I ¶

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:19.740
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:26:19.742 --> 01:26:21.341
¶ Foolish pride ¶

01:26:21.343 --> 01:26:22.876
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:26:22.878 --> 01:26:24.545
¶ Scared inside ¶

01:26:24.547 --> 01:26:26.346
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:29.483
¶ Of everything ¶

01:26:29.485 --> 01:26:31.218
¶ Counting stars ¶

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.819
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶

01:26:32.821 --> 01:26:34.454
¶ Air guitars ¶

01:26:34.456 --> 01:26:35.923
¶ I don't know how to love you ¶
