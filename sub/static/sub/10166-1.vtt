WEBVTT

01:10.070 --> 01:12.821
Put some stones in the vase,
or it'll fall over.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.163
This bloody wind!

01:21.206 --> 01:23.165
Polish the letters well.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.001
There are so many widows!

01:26.086 --> 01:28.212
The women here live longer than the men.

01:28.838 --> 01:29.880
Except poor Mom.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.507
Mom was lucky.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.925
Raimunda, don't say that!

01:33.009 --> 01:36.386
She died in Dad's arms,
and she loved him more than anyone.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.763
Burned to death!

01:39.682 --> 01:42.351
That's the worst way to die.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.894
They were asleep.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.562
They didn't even realize.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.357
Even so,
how can you say something like that?

01:48.983 --> 01:49.983
Hello, Agustina.

01:53.071 --> 01:55.072
See you later, Agustina.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.116
-Good morning, Manola.
-Good morning.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.576
-ls that everything, Mom?
-l'll get the rest.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.537
This is wonderful!

02:01.579 --> 02:02.955
Good Lord!

02:04.040 --> 02:05.415
-ls this Paula?
-Of course.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.834
She's all grown up!

02:06.876 --> 02:08.544
Give her a kiss.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.421
She's got your father's eyes.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.550
-How are you?
-Not good.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.051
Don't say that.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.847
l want to give my grave the once-over.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.266
With this wind, you can't keep it clean.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.394
-lt looks lovely.
-Cleaning it relaxes me.

02:25.436 --> 02:29.189
l often come and sit here on my own,
and time goes by.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.067
We're going now,
we have to see Aunt Paula.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.485
Come and see me afterwards.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.237
Sure.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.573
How's Paco?

02:37.657 --> 02:40.409
He's fine. He stayed in Madrid, working.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.246
Mom,

02:44.289 --> 02:46.874
does Agustina really come and clean
her own grave?

02:46.916 --> 02:48.917
Yes, it's the custom here.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.545
They buy a plot and look after it
all their lives,

02:51.588 --> 02:53.088
like a second home.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.133
-That freaks me out!
-lt's tradition here.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.344
-Shall l drive?
-Yes.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.204
Aunt Paula!

03:26.080 --> 03:27.164
Who is it?

03:27.248 --> 03:28.373
Raimunda!

03:28.458 --> 03:30.792
-Don't take all day.
-Don't rush me.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.920
l don't like going back in the dark.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.088
Be nice to Auntie, don't laugh at her.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.173
All right.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.258
This house still smells of Mom.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.010
How are you, Aunt?

03:41.596 --> 03:44.473
You're very thin! Have you had the baby?

03:44.557 --> 03:46.266
Fourteen years ago.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.809
Doesn't time fly!

03:47.894 --> 03:49.019
And who are these?

03:49.103 --> 03:51.647
Who do you think? Sole and my Paula!

03:51.731 --> 03:53.315
The same name as me!

03:55.401 --> 03:56.944
And Sole.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.948
Shall we go into the dining room?

04:02.533 --> 04:05.994
That Sole looks like a right sourpuss.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.663
For heaven's sake!

04:10.166 --> 04:13.835
The wind carried the cinders to the bushes.

04:13.920 --> 04:18.757
The result is the most tragic fire
in the last 13 years.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.510
-Mind if l turn it off?
-No, l can't see it anyway.

04:23.304 --> 04:25.180
Fires are dreadful.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.140
That's how your grandparents died.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.017
Why did l come in here?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.186
l don't know.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.397
-To talk?
-No.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.607
-To get some food?
-Yes!

04:35.692 --> 04:37.526
Look in the sideboard.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.071
l'm very shaky on my pins.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.532
Look, wafers!

04:43.616 --> 04:45.659
Just like Mom's. Eat up.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.038
How was the cemetery?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.874
Your mother is delighted.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.835
Did you scrub the headstone properly?

04:54.877 --> 04:56.545
Of course.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.297
She likes it to be clean.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.632
lf she could, she'd clean it herself.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.926
But, of course, she can't.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.513
Of course, she can't.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.891
Don't you feel lonely in this big house?

05:09.934 --> 05:11.393
No.

05:11.436 --> 05:14.730
You'd be better off in a home,
where you'd be looked after.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.857
l'm fine as l am.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.483
l'm going to the bathroom.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.860
Well, go!

05:21.821 --> 05:25.324
You can't live on your own.
l'm worried about you.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.200
How do you manage your meals?

05:27.243 --> 05:28.243
Very well.

05:28.328 --> 05:31.330
Agustina brings me bread,
your mother does the cooking,

05:31.414 --> 05:34.124
and if l need anything l call the store
and they bring it.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.168
l'm fine.

06:23.299 --> 06:25.258
What a lovely touch!

06:26.719 --> 06:28.387
Look!

06:28.471 --> 06:30.430
lt's got your name on it.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.642
Shall we go?

06:34.477 --> 06:35.894
Yes.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.397
We're leaving now.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.941
l'm so shaky on my pins.

06:40.983 --> 06:42.150
Don't get up.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.319
How could l not get up?

06:46.656 --> 06:49.783
Next time l come back,
l'm taking you home with me.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.868
Yes, next time.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.496
What matters is that you come back.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.832
You've gotten very wobbly.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.230
Take care of yourself.

07:20.314 --> 07:21.440
l will.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.487
Mind how you go!

07:27.530 --> 07:30.198
We'll do that. l love you lots!

07:31.242 --> 07:34.119
-Shall we go to Agustina's?
-Yes.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.963
Come in!

07:47.216 --> 07:48.884
Well?

07:48.968 --> 07:50.510
How did you find your aunt?

07:50.553 --> 07:52.220
-Bad.
-Terrible.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.764
She's gotten very shaky.
l don't know how she copes.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.309
She does very well without going outside.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.728
She eats a stick of bread every day.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.730
She leaves the money for me.

08:01.814 --> 08:02.939
Let's go onto the patio.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.067
She's in an awful state, love.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.777
She doesn't know what year it is.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.405
She talks about Mom
as if she were still alive.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.241
For her, she isn't dead.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.160
She can't accept it.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.037
Sit down for a while.

08:17.079 --> 08:20.582
l'd like to pay you something
to look in on her every day.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.084
l won't accept anything!

08:23.127 --> 08:25.170
l'm very happy to do it.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.338
l'd take her home,

08:26.422 --> 08:29.216
but l'd have to throw my husband out
to make room.

08:29.258 --> 08:30.926
But we have to do something.

08:30.968 --> 08:34.221
Every morning, before l go shopping,
l tap on her window

08:34.263 --> 08:37.807
and l don't move until she answers me.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.683
l keep an eye on her.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.937
l really appreciate that.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.274
l like to think

08:46.359 --> 08:49.736
someone's doing that for my mother,

08:49.779 --> 08:51.196
wherever she is.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.829
Look! Wasn't she cutting edge then?

09:01.666 --> 09:03.625
The only hippie in the village.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.378
Look at her plastic jewelry.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.173
They're awesome!

09:10.258 --> 09:11.800
First-rate plastic.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.723
Every time l smoke a joint l think of her.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.685
That's a fine example you're setting
for Paula!

09:21.769 --> 09:23.728
There's still no news?

09:23.813 --> 09:24.980
Nothing.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.232
lt's like the earth swallowed her up.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.650
And your sister Brigida?

09:28.734 --> 09:29.734
Her?

09:29.819 --> 09:32.529
She's in Madrid, she's a big hit on trash TV.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.492
Mom, l'm out of credit!

09:37.577 --> 09:40.829
Good, we'll get a break from the telephone.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.163
You can use mine.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.499
-She'll bankrupt you.
-ln that case, no.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.877
As l was saying,
Brigida is on so many shows

09:47.962 --> 09:50.088
she can put a deposit
on an apartment in Madrid.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.132
And she's going to make a record.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.967
She always liked singing.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.510
So did this one.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.512
Remember when you and she,

09:57.555 --> 09:59.431
you must've been thirteen,

09:59.515 --> 10:01.975
went to an audition for child singers?

10:02.018 --> 10:05.395
Hey, you never told me that!

10:05.479 --> 10:08.064
lt was your granny's idea.
She was up for anything.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.525
Talking of mothers,
maybe yours hasn't shown up

10:10.568 --> 10:12.444
so as not to ruin your sister's career.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.237
No.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.364
Mom would love to be on television.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.035
She'd go crazy.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.202
Want some?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.954
No, no, no.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.874
l grow it myself. Look at the plants.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.003
We have to leave.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.212
Yes.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.840
Did you report her disappearance
to the police?

10:33.883 --> 10:36.217
Brigida thinks it isn't necessary.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.928
She's said it so often on TV.

10:39.013 --> 10:42.766
Yes, but you have to report it to the police,
not say it on TV.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.726
l don't know.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.481
ln any case, it's not the first time
she's left home.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.108
But never for so long.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.194
lt's been over three years.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.029
Don't give up hope.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.740
And take care of yourself,
you don't look well.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.325
Your oleander looks wonderful.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.577
Yes, it didn't get aphids this year.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.246
But l've really lost my appetite.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.414
Maybe it's the joints.

11:06.457 --> 11:10.168
No, if it weren't for them,
l wouldn't eat at all.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.256
Your father's eyes.

11:18.135 --> 11:22.263
A joint makes me feel a bit hungry,
and it relaxes me.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.395
Safe journey!

11:41.784 --> 11:45.203
Guess what l saw upstairs
beside the bathroom?

11:45.287 --> 11:47.622
What?

11:47.665 --> 11:49.541
An exercise bike.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.084
That freaks me out!

11:51.127 --> 11:53.962
Why would Auntie want a bike
if she can't walk?

11:54.046 --> 11:56.923
Exactly, she's lost her mind.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.634
Don't talk like that about her.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.970
She didn't even recognize us.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.597
lt's the wind.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.809
That goddamn East wind here
drives people crazy!

12:09.395 --> 12:12.313
The wafers are delicious.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.400
How can she bake those
when she's as blind as a bat?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.719
Hello, Regina.

12:42.803 --> 12:43.887
Going to work?

12:43.971 --> 12:45.555
Got no choice, love.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.515
Why not give her a lift?

12:47.558 --> 12:48.558
Where are you going?

12:48.642 --> 12:51.895
To the club.
lf you drop me in the center that'd be great.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.563
-All right.
-Thanks.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.356
See you later.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.041
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.125
Hello.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.009
Well?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.220
Did you have fun?

13:25.304 --> 13:28.556
ln the cemetery? You kidding me?

13:32.102 --> 13:34.062
Were you having a party?

13:34.104 --> 13:36.064
Me? What do you mean?

13:37.399 --> 13:39.859
Paula, sit properly. Close your legs!

13:41.737 --> 13:43.905
Will you bring me another beer?

13:43.989 --> 13:46.032
Are you kidding?

13:47.868 --> 13:49.911
Go on, please.

13:49.995 --> 13:53.873
Haven't you had enough?
You have to work tomorrow.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.337
l'm free tomorrow, and the day after, too.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.755
How come?

14:02.132 --> 14:03.550
l was fired.

14:03.592 --> 14:05.051
Hang on.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.096
Christ Almighty!

14:09.431 --> 14:12.433
l'll get a job on Sundays,
it's my only free day.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.520
l'll get a job.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.272
But let me watch the game in peace.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.568
You can forget about soccer.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.944
There'll be no more cable.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.030
We're a poor family, and we'll live like one.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.157
Paula, put that phone down!

14:29.118 --> 14:31.286
Your supper's here if you want it.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.236
Are you angry?

15:05.654 --> 15:07.322
No.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.575
l'm worried about my aunt.

15:10.659 --> 15:12.827
She's worse than ever.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.914
She didn't even recognize Paula and Sole.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.461
-l don't know how she manages.
-But she does.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.132
Leave me be.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.136
What's wrong?

15:30.179 --> 15:33.056
l'm worn out, and l have to get up early.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.934
l'll do the work.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.438
Don't be a pest!

15:48.614 --> 15:50.239
Don't call me a pest.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.076
Sorry.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.244
What are you doing here?

17:19.288 --> 17:20.704
Waiting for you.

17:20.789 --> 17:21.830
What for?

17:24.251 --> 17:27.962
l called you loads of times to tell you
to buy bread.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.131
l don't suppose you thought to buy any.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.215
No.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.301
You're soaked.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.012
How long have you been here?

17:36.096 --> 17:37.597
A while.

17:39.850 --> 17:43.102
Where were you? With your pals?

17:43.145 --> 17:45.146
No.

17:45.230 --> 17:48.149
l wasn't anywhere.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.151
Why didn't you answer the phone?

17:52.321 --> 17:53.488
What's wrong?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.494
ls something wrong?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.290
Tell me, what's happened?

18:10.839 --> 18:12.173
Where's your father?

18:15.886 --> 18:18.012
He's...

18:18.097 --> 18:19.305
Where?

18:21.308 --> 18:22.600
ln the kitchen.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.613
What happened?

18:35.697 --> 18:38.741
l was in the kitchen

18:38.826 --> 18:41.369
with my back to him,

18:41.411 --> 18:45.039
and suddenly Dad jumped on me.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.208
He was drunk.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.127
l asked him what he was doing,

18:49.211 --> 18:51.462
and he said he wasn't my father.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.883
l pushed him away.

18:57.594 --> 19:00.096
But he got up and put his arms around me.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.058
l pushed him again.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.316
He unzipped his pants.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.486
He kept saying that it wasn't wrong

19:15.571 --> 19:17.155
and that he wasn't my father!

19:22.411 --> 19:24.871
l took a knife from the drawer

19:24.913 --> 19:26.998
and l threatened him,

19:27.082 --> 19:29.167
but it was only to scare him.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.339
He didn't believe me.

19:37.092 --> 19:39.218
He said l wouldn't dare

19:41.180 --> 19:43.014
and he jumped on me.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.522
What are you going to do?

19:56.111 --> 19:58.321
l don't know.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.242
Go and change, or you'll get pneumonia.

20:08.624 --> 20:12.418
Remember, l killed him,

20:12.461 --> 20:14.795
and you saw nothing, you weren't here.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.925
lt's very important you remember that.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.741
Don't open!

22:06.825 --> 22:08.576
Who can it be?

22:08.618 --> 22:10.202
l don't know.

22:10.245 --> 22:11.245
Go to your room.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.291
Raimunda, it's me, Emilio.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.503
Coming!

22:26.762 --> 22:28.095
Hi there.

22:28.138 --> 22:31.223
l'm sorry, l know it's late, but l'm
going to Barcelona tomorrow.

22:31.266 --> 22:35.186
l want to give you the restaurant keys
in case anyone comes to see it.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.523
l don't mind, it's just l'm never at home.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.650
What about Paco? He's always here.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.612
Paco...

22:44.696 --> 22:48.449
He finally got a job.
He's starting tomorrow.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.034
Are you hurt?

22:50.118 --> 22:53.537
Women's troubles.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.623
But now that l think about it,

22:55.665 --> 22:58.626
with Paco working l'll have more free time.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.630
-Give me the keys, l'll sort it out.
-Here.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.965
This is my brother's home number.

23:05.008 --> 23:06.509
The other is my cell phone.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.805
-You're leaving tomorrow?
-ln the morning.

23:12.432 --> 23:14.683
Tell me, how much are you asking?

23:14.768 --> 23:16.435
l always liked your restaurant.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.938
lt's a pity you didn't like the owner, too.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.648
Emilio, please...

23:20.690 --> 23:24.276
For the lease, five million,
but it's negotiable.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.114
We'll miss you.

23:28.156 --> 23:29.990
And l'll miss you girls.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.663
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

23:39.042 --> 23:42.795
-ls Emilio leaving?
-Yes.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.505
Go back to your room.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.841
l want to be with you.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.931
You'll have to help me later.

23:57.727 --> 23:58.853
Don't answer!

24:01.731 --> 24:03.524
lt'll be one of your pals.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.655
Answer it, tell them you can't talk.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.574
This is no time to be calling.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.370
l can't talk...

24:16.413 --> 24:19.457
What do you mean? lt's your Aunt Sole.

24:19.541 --> 24:20.791
Put your mother on.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.668
lt's Aunt Sole.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.463
Tell her l'm busy.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.339
She's busy now.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.341
Put her on, it's important.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.385
Take the phone, Mom.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.142
Sole, l've got a pile of ironing,

24:38.226 --> 24:40.394
and l was out working all afternoon.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.105
Agustina rang.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.607
Aunt Paula is dead.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.484
When?

24:46.568 --> 24:47.735
A little while ago.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.240
Aunt Paula is dead.

24:56.411 --> 24:59.705
Just a minute ago l was thinking of
bringing her here.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.751
She died all alone!

25:03.793 --> 25:05.419
Don't cry, pet.

25:05.462 --> 25:09.590
Listen, Agustina said we're not to worry.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.801
She and Squinty will lay her out
before we get there.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.762
Auntie had everything organized.

25:14.846 --> 25:18.474
She even chose her coffin
and paid for everything.

25:18.558 --> 25:22.311
lt's incredible that she was so lucid
at the end.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.605
l can't go to the funeral.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.273
l'm truly sorry,

25:26.358 --> 25:28.776
but l'm very busy.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.654
How can you not go?
What will people say?

25:31.738 --> 25:33.822
l can't go, not remotely.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.284
You have to go on your own.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.494
On my own?

25:38.578 --> 25:40.788
No way.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.957
You know l'm terrified of the dead.

25:42.999 --> 25:45.167
But you needn't see Auntie.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.461
l'll tell Agustina to make sure of that.

25:47.504 --> 25:48.879
And if they ask for you?

25:48.964 --> 25:51.590
Say l've had a gallbladder operation.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.217
Anything.

25:53.301 --> 25:56.136
l'll go later, but today it's not
remotely possible.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.099
l don't understand you.
Auntie loved you so much.

26:00.141 --> 26:03.060
And l loved her.

26:03.144 --> 26:07.189
l'll explain it to you someday,
and that day, you'll flip.

26:07.274 --> 26:08.607
l'm flipping now.

26:08.650 --> 26:12.528
Take a tranquilizer.
l'm going to take one, too.

26:12.612 --> 26:15.656
And you go tomorrow morning.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.699
All right?

26:16.783 --> 26:18.242
l guess...

26:38.388 --> 26:39.805
The door!

27:00.368 --> 27:02.202
Wait!

28:07.727 --> 28:10.729
You stay here. Stay here and keep watch.

28:12.399 --> 28:15.234
l hope it hasn't changed
since l worked here.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.801
DEEP FREEZE

30:03.051 --> 30:04.510
Stay where you are!

30:04.552 --> 30:06.094
Sorry.

30:08.014 --> 30:10.516
What do you want?

30:10.558 --> 30:12.518
ls the restaurant open?

30:12.560 --> 30:14.186
No.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.646
Why?

30:15.730 --> 30:16.855
Give me a hand.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.944
We're shooting a film in the area,

30:22.028 --> 30:25.405
and l'm looking for somewhere
we can all eat.

30:26.324 --> 30:29.159
Do you know any restaurants around here?

30:31.287 --> 30:33.121
How many are you?

30:33.206 --> 30:35.207
25 and 5... 30.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.086
Come on, help me.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.757
l can do it for you, if you want.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.510
We were going to close today.

30:46.594 --> 30:49.346
So, lunch for 30.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.056
At what time?

30:51.099 --> 30:54.268
We stop at 3:30, and we're very close.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.936
Around 4:00?

30:56.020 --> 30:57.271
Yeah.

30:59.399 --> 31:02.150
And tell me, how much?

31:02.235 --> 31:04.111
Ten euros a head.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.737
That's fine.

31:07.615 --> 31:10.117
l'm sorry l shouted at you,

31:10.201 --> 31:12.035
but you scared me.

31:14.622 --> 31:16.665
-Well, l'll see you at 4:00.
-Sure.

31:16.749 --> 31:18.125
Thanks a lot.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.045
lt's 1 0:00!

31:27.218 --> 31:29.303
-Two kilos.
-Give me another two kilos.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.557
How much are the potatoes?

31:33.641 --> 31:36.852
1 .60 for four kilos.

31:36.936 --> 31:38.103
Give me eight kilos.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.396
Sure.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.277
Hello, Regina.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.863
Hello, you're carting quite a load!

31:47.947 --> 31:50.073
l have to make lunch for 30.

31:50.158 --> 31:53.410
-Could you lend me 1 00 euros?
-l'm broke, love.

31:53.494 --> 31:55.871
l've just bought a chunk of pork this big.

31:55.955 --> 31:58.457
l could use that. l'll buy it from you.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.334
lt cost me 1 0.80. lt's all l have!

32:00.418 --> 32:03.086
l'll pay you tomorrow. Come on!

32:03.171 --> 32:04.755
l'll bring it over to you now.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.132
-Thanks, love.
-l'll have to diet today.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.842
lt'll do you good.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.932
Hey, lnes! Back from the village?

32:15.016 --> 32:18.101
l got here yesterday. How are you?

32:18.186 --> 32:21.605
Did you happen to bring
any sausages or chorizo?

32:21.689 --> 32:24.191
l certainly did! The sausages are great.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.860
My mother-in-law orders them specially
for me.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.613
-l need a kilo or so.
-Why's that?

32:29.697 --> 32:32.407
-l have to cook for 30.
-Who's coming?

32:32.492 --> 32:34.409
l'll tell you later.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.703
Can l buy them? l'll pay you tomorrow.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.456
-Sure, it's no problem.
-Thanks.

32:39.540 --> 32:42.668
Did you bring anything sweet?

32:42.710 --> 32:45.379
l brought some cookies
that melt in your mouth.

32:45.421 --> 32:48.298
With the way your glucose
and cholesterol are,

32:48.383 --> 32:50.175
l can't believe you brought cookies.

32:50.218 --> 32:53.512
lt's my only vice. Three boxes.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.055
You shouldn't eat them.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.725
-What do l do, give them away?
-Sell them to me.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.435
At least let me taste them.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.272
You can eat three or four,
but don't stuff yourself.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.234
-Bring them round to me, love.
-l'll do that.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.527
-Thanks.
-Bye, love.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.237
Bye, pet.

Upstairs, in my mother's room,

35:25.665 --> 35:28.542
the best room in the house.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.002
l brought her here to give her a better wake.

35:31.045 --> 35:33.046
Thank you so much.

35:34.590 --> 35:38.093
Come on, we're the principal mourners.

Good afternoon.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.937

35:49.021 --> 35:50.897
She's just had an operation.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.691
Yes, what timing.

35:52.733 --> 35:54.901
She said you're not to see the body.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.113
Don't worry, you won't have to.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.926
Say hello to Vicenta's daughter.

36:22.305 --> 36:26.141
We'll let her rest a while, she's very tired.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.685
Come on.

36:28.769 --> 36:30.228
Over here.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.278
lt was late at night.

36:39.488 --> 36:41.865
l'd had supper,
and l was watching the television.

36:43.618 --> 36:46.494
l heard someone knocking at my door.

36:48.122 --> 36:52.167
l wasn't sure, but just then

36:52.251 --> 36:54.461
l heard the same noise,

36:54.503 --> 36:58.089
and l asked, "Who is it?"

36:58.132 --> 37:01.218
And a voice answered,

37:01.302 --> 37:02.510
"Agustina."

37:04.305 --> 37:06.473
l wasn't afraid.

37:06.557 --> 37:09.476
l went outside, but l saw no one.

37:10.519 --> 37:12.437
l looked over at your aunt's house,

37:12.480 --> 37:15.315
and the door seemed to be open.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.651
l thought it was odd,

37:17.693 --> 37:20.237
so l went in.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.530
l called your aunt,

37:22.615 --> 37:25.492
but she didn't answer me.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.869
How could she answer me, poor thing?

37:29.080 --> 37:31.164
l went into her room,

37:31.207 --> 37:34.417
and l found her there, in bed,

37:34.502 --> 37:37.212
as still as a little bird!

37:37.296 --> 37:39.673
lt was her spirit that warned you.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.926
But was it Paula's spirit or the other one's?

37:43.010 --> 37:44.427
One of the two.

37:44.512 --> 37:47.806
l can't say who it was, l didn't see.

37:47.848 --> 37:50.600
But just as l'm listening to you now,

37:50.685 --> 37:55.355
someone or something warned me that
Paula had died,

37:55.439 --> 37:57.941
and opened the door so l could go in.

37:58.359 --> 38:01.027
Come into the kitchen.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.496
l bet you haven't eaten yet.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.498
No.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.793
Not since last night, but l'm all right.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.921
l thought as much.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.131
This'll do you good.

38:21.215 --> 38:24.092
Don't give me any more. That's enough.

38:31.058 --> 38:33.560
What did the women mean?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.855
lt was just talk.

38:36.897 --> 38:38.815
You know what villages are like.

38:38.899 --> 38:41.151
They were talking about my mother.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.320
Some people say they've seen her.

38:45.239 --> 38:48.325
They say she came back to look after
your Aunt Paula.

38:50.619 --> 38:51.995
Has she not appeared to you?

38:53.122 --> 38:54.914
No. What about you?

38:54.957 --> 38:57.584
No, but those things happen.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.252
l know.

38:59.295 --> 39:03.089
My grandfather, God rest him, appeared
to my grandmother.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.426
At first she was frightened.

39:06.469 --> 39:07.761
Eat up!

39:09.055 --> 39:11.598
Then she asked him what he wanted,

39:11.682 --> 39:13.391
and his spirit told her

39:13.434 --> 39:16.853
there was a promise he hadn't fulfilled.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.855
She carried it out,

39:18.939 --> 39:21.608
and the whole village went with her
to the cemetery,

39:21.650 --> 39:24.194
where they left my grandfather so he'd
rest in peace.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.653
And he never appeared again.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.329
That isn't just a story l heard.

39:34.413 --> 39:35.914
l lived it.

40:08.906 --> 40:10.865
Do you want to go into your aunt's house

40:10.950 --> 40:13.785
in case you want to take anything?

40:13.828 --> 40:15.787
No, Raimunda will come later.

40:15.830 --> 40:19.707
Tell her it went very well
and the whole village came.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.460
l'll do that.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.630
l'm going to miss her so much!

40:30.261 --> 40:31.511
Go on.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.743
Let me out, Sole!

41:42.082 --> 41:44.542
Let me out! l'm your mother.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.419
l won't do anything to you.

41:54.178 --> 41:56.095
My mother is dead.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.976
lf you're anything,
you're her ghost or her spirit.

42:02.061 --> 42:04.604
Whatever you say, but get me out of here.

42:04.647 --> 42:06.481
l'm in the trunk of your car.

42:07.441 --> 42:11.819
Really, Mom, the things you do!

42:21.539 --> 42:23.498
Soledad,

42:23.582 --> 42:25.625
daughter,

42:25.709 --> 42:28.253
don't be afraid of me.

42:28.295 --> 42:29.546
l'm your mother.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.967
Aren't you going to give me a hug?

42:46.772 --> 42:48.398
Now, give me a hand.

42:48.482 --> 42:49.649
Take this.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.655
-Auntie's suitcase!
-Yes.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.578
What is all this?

43:01.662 --> 43:04.581
Clothes and some valuables Auntie had.

43:04.665 --> 43:07.166
A good thing l hid them
before the neighbors arrived.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.961
Except for Agustina, they all went
through everything,

43:10.004 --> 43:12.755
but l'd got there first.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.925
You'll have to give Agustina a gift,
she's been so good.

43:16.010 --> 43:17.510
Better than your sister.

43:17.553 --> 43:20.597
There was such a fuss
when she didn't turn up.

43:20.681 --> 43:24.017
lf you'd heard what Squinty said about her!

43:24.101 --> 43:27.520
Thank heavens you came.

43:27.563 --> 43:29.564
l'm wrecked after the trip.

43:33.068 --> 43:37.071
-Are you sleeping here?
-Yes, where do you want me to go?

43:37.156 --> 43:39.324
What a sight!

43:39.366 --> 43:41.701
l'm not surprised l scared you.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.828
Do you still have the illegal hair salon?

43:43.871 --> 43:46.289
That's how l make my living.

43:46.373 --> 43:50.126
-ls that the guest room?
-Yes, that's it.

43:50.210 --> 43:53.212
Tomorrow, you can give me
a color and a trim.

43:53.255 --> 43:55.048
And l need dark glasses, too.

43:55.090 --> 43:57.717
l don't want to be stuck in the house all day.

43:57.801 --> 43:59.677
l have to go out.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.471
Nobody knows me here.

44:01.555 --> 44:05.058
ln the village, l couldn't even go to
the front door.

44:05.100 --> 44:07.268
l need a bit of air.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.898
Are you staying for long?

44:12.858 --> 44:14.567
You want to throw me out already?

44:14.652 --> 44:16.277
No, l'm just asking.

44:16.904 --> 44:21.115
l'll stay for as long as God wills,
if you don't mind.

44:22.743 --> 44:25.870
When you tire of me,
you just have to say so.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.538
But for a separated woman,

44:27.581 --> 44:29.832
who's better company than her mother?

44:30.584 --> 44:34.587
Unless you've got yourself a sweetie-pie.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.047
No, Mom.

44:36.090 --> 44:39.008
l'm alone, like always.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.134
Not anymore.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.305
Answer the phone.

44:46.642 --> 44:49.102
-Are you back?
-Yes.

44:49.186 --> 44:51.604
You were out of range, so l rang Agustina.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.773
She said it all went very well.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.942
The whole village came.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.777
l've been thinking about you all day.

44:57.861 --> 45:00.029
l really wanted to be there.

45:00.739 --> 45:02.573
Hang on, Sole.

45:02.616 --> 45:03.658
300.

45:05.327 --> 45:07.620
-What do I owe for the drinks?
-Nothing.

45:07.705 --> 45:08.788
They're on the house.

45:08.872 --> 45:12.125
-Well, tomorrow, same time.
-Sure.

45:12.167 --> 45:14.419
-The crew was very happy.
-l'm glad.

45:14.461 --> 45:17.130
lf you don't mind,
and even if you charge more,

45:17.214 --> 45:19.882
could the helpings be more generous?

45:19.967 --> 45:23.302
Tomorrow,
you'll have food coming out your eyes.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.805
-Great, see you then.
-So long.

45:28.809 --> 45:29.809
Sorry, Sole.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.353
Have you got a job in a restaurant, too?

45:32.438 --> 45:34.856
Yes, l've taken over Emilio's place.

45:34.940 --> 45:36.149
Good Lord!

45:36.233 --> 45:37.400
He was sick of it,

45:37.484 --> 45:40.361
but that's not the only news.

45:40.446 --> 45:41.446
Paco has left us.

45:41.488 --> 45:43.698
That's why I couldn't go to the funeral.

45:43.782 --> 45:45.742
We were having a row when you rang.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.910
l knew something was wrong.

45:48.871 --> 45:49.871
Did he hit you?

45:49.955 --> 45:52.874
Paco wasn't violent.

45:52.958 --> 45:54.500
He's just gone,

45:54.585 --> 45:56.919
forever

45:57.004 --> 45:58.504
He'll come back, you'll see.

45:58.589 --> 46:00.548
l doubt it.

46:00.632 --> 46:01.841
Why are you so sure?

46:01.884 --> 46:03.676
You can tell these things.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.346
Well, so long.

46:08.348 --> 46:09.348
So long.

46:09.391 --> 46:10.850
Bye.

46:12.352 --> 46:15.772
None of the three of us had any luck
with men.

46:15.856 --> 46:18.983
Raimunda and l didn't, but you...

46:19.026 --> 46:20.401
Me, what?

46:20.486 --> 46:22.528
Dad adored you.

46:22.571 --> 46:25.406
Raimunda says that you were lucky,

46:25.491 --> 46:27.992
you died in the arms
of the person you loved most.

46:28.035 --> 46:30.995
Your sister isn't a bad person,
but she's got a nasty streak.

46:32.206 --> 46:33.873
l was blind about him,

46:33.916 --> 46:37.376
and he cheated on me until the day he died!

46:38.086 --> 46:40.671
-What do you mean?
-lt's true.

46:40.714 --> 46:44.342
l kept that quiet all my life.
l never wanted you two to know.

46:44.384 --> 46:47.804
But let's drop it.
l don't want to talk ill of the dead.

46:48.555 --> 46:52.266
-ls he going to appear?
-l hope not.

46:52.351 --> 46:54.393
And your husband?

46:54.436 --> 46:56.145
What about him?

46:56.230 --> 46:58.231
Might he turn up someday?

46:58.273 --> 46:59.816
l doubt it.

46:59.900 --> 47:02.276
l haven't heard from him in two years.

47:02.361 --> 47:05.696
All the better.
lt'll just be the two of us together.

47:57.958 --> 48:00.167
The pork cost you 1 0?

48:00.252 --> 48:01.627
1 0.80.

48:01.670 --> 48:05.131
-l'll give you an extra 3 euros.
-Thanks, love.

48:05.173 --> 48:08.634
And l'll pay you for four boxes of cookies,
not three.

48:08.719 --> 48:09.802
Thanks.

48:09.845 --> 48:11.721
l don't want you to think l'd cheat you.

48:13.640 --> 48:17.310
Could you help me with this?
l can't move it on my own.

48:17.394 --> 48:20.563
-Where are you taking it?
-To the restaurant.

48:20.647 --> 48:23.399
You're the expert in removals.
Where do we...

48:23.483 --> 48:26.694
Get ahold of it, tip it over,
but not all the way.

48:26.778 --> 48:29.989
-Otherwise, we won't get it through.
-ls this all right?

48:30.073 --> 48:33.200
Now, straighten up, to the right,
more to the right...

48:33.285 --> 48:37.288
-We can't see anything.
-l'll guide you.

48:37.331 --> 48:40.166
Careful, it'll come this way.

48:40.208 --> 48:41.667
All the way...

48:41.710 --> 48:43.085
Don't rush it.

48:44.963 --> 48:46.213
Are we at the door?

48:48.091 --> 48:50.176
The elevator is here.

48:50.260 --> 48:53.471
Wait, wait. This has to go in straight.

48:53.513 --> 48:56.015
l'll take this end.

48:56.058 --> 48:57.183
You take it.

48:57.267 --> 48:58.559
You're doing fine.

48:58.644 --> 49:00.269
Good Lord! This is tough.

49:00.354 --> 49:01.354
Careful!

49:05.859 --> 49:07.485
Call it from downstairs.

49:12.032 --> 49:14.200
l want them to see we don't use frozen food.

49:14.284 --> 49:16.994
lt's all natural, fresh every day.

49:17.037 --> 49:18.537
Over to the corner.

49:18.580 --> 49:21.123
-And the other freezer?
-lt's broken.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.376
So you're taking over the restaurant?

49:23.418 --> 49:27.171
Yes, at least until the crew finishes the film.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.714
Then l'll see.

49:28.757 --> 49:32.093
You can count on me.
l make great desserts.

49:32.177 --> 49:35.012
And l can serve drinks at night.

49:35.055 --> 49:38.557
l don't know if we'll work nights,
but l'm counting on you.

49:38.600 --> 49:40.559
-Sure.
-And thanks.

49:44.022 --> 49:45.231
Mom...

49:48.902 --> 49:51.988
ls there anything you want me to do?

49:52.072 --> 49:53.572
Cut my hair.

49:54.741 --> 49:56.993
l mean,

49:57.077 --> 49:59.120
is there anything

49:59.204 --> 50:01.163
you left undone in life

50:01.248 --> 50:04.709
that won't let you rest in peace?

50:04.751 --> 50:07.962
People always leave things undone,

50:08.046 --> 50:10.464
or done badly,

50:10.549 --> 50:13.509
and l'm no exception.

50:13.593 --> 50:16.262
But l don't know if they can be fixed.

50:16.346 --> 50:18.014
And if they can,

50:18.098 --> 50:19.932
it's up to me to fix them.

50:22.436 --> 50:26.272
My clients will be arriving soon.
What'll we do?

50:26.314 --> 50:29.233
Look after them. l'll help you.

50:29.276 --> 50:31.277
But l can't say you're my mother.

50:31.319 --> 50:33.362
They know l'm an orphan.

50:33.447 --> 50:35.322
l'll say l'm a foreigner.

50:35.407 --> 50:38.868
A foreigner? From where?

50:38.952 --> 50:39.952
Dominican Republic?

50:40.037 --> 50:42.163
No, there are lots around here,

50:42.247 --> 50:44.165
they'd notice your accent.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.418
Chinese?

50:47.461 --> 50:49.253
Madrid's full of Chinese.

50:49.296 --> 50:52.339
Who'd believe you're Chinese?

50:52.424 --> 50:55.634
Something we don't have around here.

50:55.677 --> 50:56.761
Russian!

51:00.348 --> 51:02.516
Do l really look more Russian than Chinese?

51:02.601 --> 51:06.187
Yes, the Russians are like us.

51:06.271 --> 51:10.232
Look, whatever you hear,
keep your mouth shut.

51:10.317 --> 51:13.694
And don't let them see
that you understand us.

51:13.779 --> 51:15.571
l'll show you how everything works.

51:15.655 --> 51:17.698
ln the bedroom, l cut, dry, and color,

51:17.783 --> 51:19.575
and here l wash their hair.

51:20.869 --> 51:23.454
lf the client is tall, lift this up.

51:23.497 --> 51:25.664
lf she's small, put it down.

51:25.707 --> 51:29.168
This towel is to keep you from slipping.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.503
And l keep this here

51:30.545 --> 51:33.005
because up above it's very uncomfortable,

51:33.048 --> 51:34.381
and if it's down there,

51:34.466 --> 51:37.510
l have to bend down so often
l wreck my back.

51:37.594 --> 51:40.304
l get a lot of backaches, too.

51:40.347 --> 51:42.223
And the shampoo is measured out.

51:42.307 --> 51:43.682
Sit down.

51:49.106 --> 51:50.689
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

51:50.732 --> 51:53.609
Just one towel
or the client will feel suffocated.

51:53.693 --> 51:55.820
l'm the same.

51:55.862 --> 51:58.364
And then, with that same towel,

51:58.406 --> 52:01.826
you dry her hair a bit so it doesn't
drip down her back.

52:01.868 --> 52:04.995
lt's all so well organized.
You're very smart, love.

52:11.253 --> 52:12.962
Hello.

52:17.884 --> 52:19.969
She doesn't speak Spanish, she's Russian.

52:20.053 --> 52:21.804
They're in a terrible state.

52:21.888 --> 52:23.722
l took her in out of charity.

52:23.765 --> 52:26.851
When l saw her begging in the street,
she reminded me of my mother.

52:26.893 --> 52:28.727
Don't trust all the old women you see.

52:28.770 --> 52:31.063
Especially Russians.
There are lots of mafias.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.065
People take advantage of you.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.776
Are you getting streaks? Sit down here.

52:36.945 --> 52:39.405
-Wash hair.
-Yes.

52:39.489 --> 52:41.073
She was a hairdresser in Russia.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.658
How do you communicate?

52:42.742 --> 52:45.578
With signs. She understands everything.
She's sharp.

52:45.620 --> 52:47.413
She'll speak Spanish in no time.

52:47.497 --> 52:51.083
Yes, look at all the top models
who are Russian.

52:51.126 --> 52:52.168
Heavens!

52:56.673 --> 52:59.508
-So, Russian?
-Russia.

53:06.099 --> 53:07.641
The water,

53:07.726 --> 53:08.893
not hot,

53:08.935 --> 53:10.477
not cold.

53:12.147 --> 53:13.522
Very good.

53:29.706 --> 53:31.624
Hello.

53:31.666 --> 53:33.042
Hey there.

53:33.126 --> 53:35.461
We have a day off tomorrow.

53:35.545 --> 53:39.506
Then we'll have one, too.
We need a break.

53:39.591 --> 53:42.051
And we finish up next week.

53:42.135 --> 53:44.345
We wanted to have the wrap party here.

53:44.429 --> 53:45.971
Great.

53:46.014 --> 53:49.808
Do you want a sit-down meal or a buffet?

53:49.851 --> 53:52.186
A buffet would be great.

53:52.270 --> 53:55.231
And we'd like to have the terrace just for us.

53:55.315 --> 53:57.775
That's no problem.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.906
Don't look at me like that,
you make me nervous.

54:03.990 --> 54:05.824
Same here.

54:05.909 --> 54:08.619
Go and have a drink, l'm working.

54:08.662 --> 54:10.329
All right.

54:12.290 --> 54:15.292
She's been strange since she came back
from the village.

54:15.335 --> 54:17.878
lf she asks you about Paco,
you know nothing.

54:17.963 --> 54:19.505
And it's true.

54:19.589 --> 54:21.340
The less you know, the better.

54:21.383 --> 54:24.343
And above all don't keep thinking about it.

54:37.857 --> 54:39.108
Hello.

54:40.860 --> 54:43.112
-Are you with someone?
-No.

54:43.196 --> 54:46.365
-l'm going to the bathroom.
-What for?

54:46.408 --> 54:47.783
l'm dying to piss.

54:48.576 --> 54:51.161
lt's broken.
l'm waiting for the plumber.

54:51.204 --> 54:54.373
l'll throw some water down,
for Christ's sake! l have to piss.

54:57.335 --> 54:58.544
Hello!

55:00.714 --> 55:02.881
What's wrong with you?

55:02.966 --> 55:05.676
-l'm at a difficult age.
-You're not the only one.

55:05.719 --> 55:08.679
-l'm going to trim your hair.
-No, l know you.

55:08.722 --> 55:11.765
-Just the ends.
-Less than a centimeter.

55:18.898 --> 55:20.899
Tell me,

55:20.984 --> 55:22.693
has your Dad not come back?

55:22.736 --> 55:24.236
No.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.113
He said goodbye for good.

55:26.906 --> 55:30.409
That's incredible.
l just don't understand.

55:33.788 --> 55:35.539
lt smells of farts!

55:41.504 --> 55:43.380
What's your mother up to?

55:43.423 --> 55:44.423
What?

55:44.507 --> 55:47.926
She's such a pain!
Ever since she was a child.

55:47.969 --> 55:51.180
And in those days we didn't have
a bathroom.

55:51.264 --> 55:53.432
We did it in the yard.

55:53.516 --> 55:55.559
We'd be waiting for her all day.

55:55.602 --> 55:58.687
All day long she'd be in the yard,
with the hens.

55:59.981 --> 56:01.273
Raimunda!

56:36.142 --> 56:38.435
This dressing gown...

56:38.478 --> 56:40.229
lt's Mom's.

56:40.313 --> 56:41.939
l know that.

56:43.733 --> 56:45.150
And the smell?

56:46.820 --> 56:48.112
What smell?

56:48.154 --> 56:50.697
ln the bathroom and here.

56:50.782 --> 56:53.826
lt's as if Mom had just been here,
farting her ass off!

56:53.868 --> 56:55.327
Don't you smell it?

57:00.291 --> 57:01.917
The way she used to fart!

57:04.170 --> 57:07.673
And she could never hide it
because she was the first to laugh!

57:11.553 --> 57:14.138
lt's as if l can hear her now.

57:16.182 --> 57:17.766
Don't be silly!

57:25.150 --> 57:27.693
Why did you bring these clothes?

57:27.735 --> 57:30.154
No wonder you have nightmares.

57:30.196 --> 57:32.448
You give away dead people's clothes.

57:37.537 --> 57:39.788
Aunt Paula's suitcase!

57:55.388 --> 57:57.556
The antique dolls!

58:06.900 --> 58:08.442
Herjewel case!

58:11.571 --> 58:13.363
What were you going to do with this?

58:14.782 --> 58:15.991
Nothing.

58:16.075 --> 58:18.160
You were going to keep it.

58:18.244 --> 58:19.495
Really, Sole.

58:19.579 --> 58:21.914
Don't get the wrong idea.

58:21.956 --> 58:23.582
l didn't bring the case.

58:24.876 --> 58:26.335
Then why is it here?

58:28.338 --> 58:31.590
When l got to Aunt Paula's house...

58:32.800 --> 58:33.926
What?

58:36.221 --> 58:38.388
l'd never have believed this.

58:39.474 --> 58:43.936
Stealing the few things she had
before she was even in the grave.

58:44.020 --> 58:45.687
What a nerve!

58:48.858 --> 58:50.817
Don't go off like that!

59:22.892 --> 59:25.352
We have to buy another fridge.

59:26.437 --> 59:28.814
Why not fix the one in the storeroom?

59:30.149 --> 59:31.191
lt doesn't work.

59:33.486 --> 59:35.779
The motor's making a noise.

59:35.822 --> 59:39.074
l said no one is to go in there,
including you.

59:39.158 --> 59:42.578
The door was open, l went in for a hammer.

59:42.662 --> 59:44.496
Has anyone else been in?

59:44.581 --> 59:46.498
l don't think so.

59:52.380 --> 59:54.840
You said you'd got rid of him.

59:54.882 --> 59:57.009
l wasn't able to.

59:57.510 --> 59:59.845
You think l like having him in there?

01:00:04.183 --> 01:00:08.478
Get dressed, everyone will be arriving soon.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:20.324
Why are you still like that?

01:00:20.366 --> 01:00:24.411
-l'm not in a party mood.
-Neither am l, but it's work.

01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:27.164
Don't be such a lazybones.

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:30.208
Come on, pet, l'll help you.

01:00:31.919 --> 01:00:33.420
What's wrong?

01:00:33.504 --> 01:00:38.925
l can't forget about it when he's so near,
in the storeroom.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.387
That's the best way to go crazy,
and to drive me crazy, too.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:45.349
You don't know what it's like to have
killed your father.

01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:49.061
Paco wasn't your father.

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:51.521
Don't lie to me anymore.

01:00:51.564 --> 01:00:55.609
l know you're doing it for me,
but please don't lie.

01:00:55.693 --> 01:00:57.736
l'm not lying.

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.821
He recognized you as his daughter,

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:02.407
but he knew he wasn't
your biological father.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.748
So was he telling me the truth?

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:10.791
Yes.

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:13.418
But that doesn't justify what he did.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:21.593
l promise l'll tell you everything
another time.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:25.138
What's the point of sitting here?

01:01:25.556 --> 01:01:27.307
Who was my father?

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.268
A guy in the village.

01:01:30.311 --> 01:01:31.978
Do l know him?

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:34.773
He's dead.

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:39.611
l'll tell you everything.

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:40.779
l swear.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.448
l'll hold you to your word.

01:01:54.752 --> 01:01:57.838
-Two mojitos!
-Coming up!

01:01:57.922 --> 01:02:00.966
What about you, love? Another two?

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:04.386
With lemon. lt's perfect.

01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:12.269
We need more glasses.

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:14.146
l can hardly keep up.

01:02:14.188 --> 01:02:16.064
lsn't Paula looking pretty?

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:22.362
Here.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.114
Thanks.

01:02:27.326 --> 01:02:28.744
How delicious!

01:02:28.828 --> 01:02:31.204
l can't take any more.
They're really good.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:34.499
With your cleavage and my mojitos,
we'd make a fortune.

01:02:34.542 --> 01:02:38.462
We should start working nights
and try to liven up

01:02:38.504 --> 01:02:40.172
this lousy neighborhood.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:43.383
We'll talk about that.
First, we have to keep this lot happy.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:44.968
Have a mojito!

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:47.512
Keep down, they mustn't see you!

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:50.599
l'd like to see Raimunda and Paula.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.769
The other day, l only saw their feet.

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:55.479
And look at the fuss you caused!

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:58.356
ls that the restaurant?

01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:03.695
She said it was going well,
but l never imagined this!

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.864
She deserves it.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:07.991
She's had a hard time.

01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:19.753
Stay in the car and don't let anyone see you.

01:03:19.837 --> 01:03:21.546
No one can see me here!

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:54.579
What are you doing here?

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:56.581
This is great!

01:03:56.666 --> 01:04:00.669
l've brought you Aunt Paula's things.
l didn't know about the party.

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:03.505
lt's a film crew celebrating
the end of the shoot.

01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:05.674
l've been catering for them.

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:07.759
Let's put the suitcase away.

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:09.678
Why did you bother?

01:04:09.762 --> 01:04:12.264
l'd never have kept anything ofAuntie's,

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:13.974
much less hidden it from you.

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:16.101
l know that. l'm sorry for what l said.

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:18.603
l always shoot my mouth off.

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.855
Hello, Auntie.

01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:23.775
-You want anything?
-No.

01:04:44.505 --> 01:04:48.884
I can see the twinkling of the lights
in the distance

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:51.803
That are marking my return

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:53.722
Remember?

01:04:54.348 --> 01:04:56.516
How could l forget?

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:59.144
lt's so long since l heard you sing!

01:04:59.186 --> 01:05:01.563
l've never heard her sing.

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:05.066
Really?

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.943
Really, never.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:12.574
-Would you like to?
-What do you think? Of course!

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:19.331
Come on!

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.128
l can't believe it.

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.390
Sit there.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:44.773
Be quiet!

01:05:44.857 --> 01:05:47.233
Sit down! This woman's going to sing!

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.323
Good evening.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.284
l'd like to thank the crew

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:58.870
for the work you've given us
these past weeks.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.581
Thank you so much.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.751
l haven't sung for a very long time,

01:06:04.835 --> 01:06:07.128
but l'll do it tonight and see how it goes.

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:26.272
I'm afraid of the encounter

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:30.110
With the past that's coming back

01:06:30.194 --> 01:06:33.071
To confront my life

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:35.573
Your grandma taught her that song

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.243
for the audition for child singers.

01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:42.372
I'm afraid of the nights

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:46.251
That, filled with memories

01:06:46.293 --> 01:06:49.379
Enchain my dreams

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:51.673
But the fleeing traveler

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:55.468
Sooner or Iater must come to a haIt

01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:59.180
And even though oblivion
Which destroys everything

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:02.600
Has killed my old illusions

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:05.437
I still retain a humble hope hidden away

01:07:05.479 --> 01:07:10.108
And that is all of my heart's fortune

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:15.113
Coming back

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:19.784
With a wrinkIed forehead

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.245
And the snows of time

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:24.205
SiIvering my brow

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:28.001
Feeling

01:07:28.085 --> 01:07:31.546
That Iife is an instant

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:33.840
That 20 years is nothing

01:07:33.924 --> 01:07:35.425
That the feverish eyes

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:38.887
Wandering in the shadows
Seek you and name you

01:07:38.971 --> 01:07:42.182
Living

01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:44.476
With my soul clinging

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.352
To a sweet memory

01:07:46.437 --> 01:07:49.647
That I weep for again

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:26.810
Autos Amigos.

01:08:26.852 --> 01:08:30.479
Good morning.
l'm calling because l saw your ad.

01:08:30.523 --> 01:08:33.483
l need to rent a van.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:35.944
What kind, and for how long?

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:39.488
The cheapest one you have.
lt's just for one day.

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:45.787
Yes?

01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:48.206
CouId I speak to Miss Raimunda?

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.499
Speaking.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:53.044
Emilio gave me your number so you could
show me the restaurant.

01:08:53.129 --> 01:08:56.381
I'm very keen to see it.
My name is CarIos.

01:08:57.883 --> 01:09:00.009
Well,

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.470
you should have called earlier

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.265
because a neighbor has taken it over.

01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:08.225
EmiIio didn't teII me that.

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:11.395
That's his strategy, just in case.

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:14.732
CouId I speak to the person
who's taken it over?

01:09:14.774 --> 01:09:17.109
This is her day off, l'm sorry.

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:21.156
lf you call Emilio l'm sure he'll
explain everything.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.241
Thank you.

01:09:23.283 --> 01:09:25.410
Goodbye.

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:39.924
-HeIIo?
-Emilio? lt's Raimunda.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:43.178
It's great to hear you.
Did a man go to see the restaurant?

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:46.930
Yes, but l didn't trust him.
l think he wanted it as a front.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.600
For what?

01:09:48.684 --> 01:09:52.228
For drugs, or to open a brothel.
l don't know.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:55.732
When l said it wasn't doing well
he said that was even better, so...

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:59.110
Why on earth did you say that?

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:03.531
l've been meaning to call you for days.

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:05.450
l hope you understand.

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:07.535
l know it's not the way to do things,

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:12.290
but l've taken over the restaurant.

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:15.752
You? What do you mean?

01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:18.296
l can explain it all to you.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:21.299
You were out of line, way out of line.

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:25.220
You abused my trust.

01:10:25.304 --> 01:10:26.554
lt's no excuse,

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:29.891
but when the film crew appeared,
l was desperate.

01:10:29.975 --> 01:10:32.810
And now that Paco's left us,
you can imagine...

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:34.479
What? Paco's left you?

01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:37.774
Yes. We had a huge fight.

01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:40.485
He's gone, and l don't think he'll be back.

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:43.529
He left the same day you went to Barcelona.

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:45.490
How are you coping?

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:48.451
Me? l'm hysterical.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.370
Clutching at straws.

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:53.998
Well, we'll try to sort it out.

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:58.169
Tell me what l owe for the month,
and l'll send it to you,

01:10:58.212 --> 01:11:00.546
but give me a few days.

01:11:20.734 --> 01:11:22.986
-Hello?
-Raimunda?

01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:24.362
Yes, who's that?

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:28.032
It's Agustina.
I'm in Madrid and I'd like to see you.

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:32.829
lt's difficult, l'm really busy today.

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:33.913
Tomorrow?

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:36.708
No, the whole week is a real mess.

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:40.211
Don't say that. I'm in the hospital.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.462
What's wrong?

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:45.216
I've got cancer.
The doctors told me yesterday.

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:47.927
I need to see you.

01:11:48.012 --> 01:11:50.638
Tell me what hospital you're in,
l'll come today.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:53.057
I'm in CentraI HospitaI.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.810
God bIess you.

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.902
You go up, l'm in a hurry.
Give this to your aunt.

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:14.662
-Hello, Auntie.
-What are you doing here?

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.751
ls that your mother shouting?

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:22.295
Come to the window!

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:25.715
What?

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:27.258
l'm leaving Paula with you.

01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:29.093
But l'm working.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:32.889
l have to go to the hospital to see Agustina.
She's got cancer.

01:12:32.931 --> 01:12:35.058
What a pity, the poor thing.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.728
Paula is bringing up Auntie's case.
Keep it.

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:42.106
l've got to do a few things,
and then l'll come back.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.775
Give my regards to Agustina.

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:47.612
-Tell her you saw me!
-Yes, nuisance.

01:12:50.574 --> 01:12:51.991
Can l come in now?

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:55.119
Yes, love.

01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:17.683
How are you?

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:23.856
They opened then closed me up again.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:27.985
-l knew l had something nasty.
-Don't give up hope.

01:13:29.154 --> 01:13:31.531
The flowers are lovely!

01:13:31.615 --> 01:13:35.618
You shouldn't have bothered.
Leave them there.

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:44.001
l have to ask you a favor.

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:47.004
Whatever you want.

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:48.923
Close the door.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.178
Get a chair.

01:14:04.982 --> 01:14:08.401
l won't last very long,

01:14:08.485 --> 01:14:11.696
but l don't want to die without knowing
what happened to my mother.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.949
But what can l do?

01:14:16.034 --> 01:14:19.704
You can tell me if she's alive or dead.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:22.457
How will l know?

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:24.459
Ask your mother.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:28.921
My mother? She's dead!

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:32.550
But she appeared to your Aunt Paula

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.343
and looked after her until she died.

01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:36.220
The whole village knows that.

01:14:36.263 --> 01:14:41.100
lf she should appear to you,
ask her about my mother.

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:43.227
That's all l'm asking.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:45.980
What you're asking me is crazy.

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:48.566
Did you ever see her with your own eyes?

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:50.276
No.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.487
And you live across the street.

01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:55.406
l think she hid from me.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:59.035
But l heard your aunt talking to her
a thousand times.

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:04.749
lf l hear anything, l'll tell you.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:08.503
But l think it's unlikely.

01:15:11.298 --> 01:15:13.382
You owe me this.

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:15.843
lt's all l'm asking.

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:18.930
l have to go, l've got lots to do.

01:15:18.972 --> 01:15:22.475
Wait, my sister wants to see you.
She'll be here any minute.

01:15:22.559 --> 01:15:25.061
Some other day, l'm in a real hurry.

01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:28.231
She wants you to go on TV.

01:15:28.273 --> 01:15:31.692
You know she works on Wherever You Are.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:34.362
They want to surprise her,
and they thought of you.

01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:38.699
You were friends as children,
and you both went to an audition.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:41.410
That's enough for several shows,

01:15:41.453 --> 01:15:43.913
with interviews, music and songs

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:47.291
from yesterday, from today and for all times.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:50.586
Tell her l don't like television.

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:54.006
Neither do l.
l'll tell her, but don't forget what l said.

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.133
l won't.

01:15:58.136 --> 01:16:01.472
The Russian loves TV.

01:16:01.557 --> 01:16:05.059
l don't know if she understands,
but she's hypnotized.

01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:07.979
There's something about trash TV.

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:11.190
Once l start watching it, l can't stop.

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:15.152
l feel worse and worse, but l'm hooked.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:16.529
lt's like a drug.

01:16:16.613 --> 01:16:19.031
l had to stop watching it at night.

01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:21.158
l couldn't sleep afterwards.

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:23.703
All that shouting drives you crazy.

01:16:25.872 --> 01:16:27.665
Do you like dolls?

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:31.043
l like these, they look like they're
from a horror movie.

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:33.254
They're very old.

01:16:33.338 --> 01:16:36.632
Your mom played with them when she was
pregnant with you.

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:38.718
Why didn't mom live with you?

01:16:38.802 --> 01:16:42.555
We were very short on money.

01:16:42.639 --> 01:16:45.016
Your granddad went to work in Venezuela,

01:16:45.058 --> 01:16:47.143
l kept Sole,

01:16:47.185 --> 01:16:49.895
and your mother went to live
with Aunt Paula.

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:52.732
What has she told you?

01:16:52.816 --> 01:16:55.109
Nothing, she doesn't like talking about
that time.

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:57.695
Do you get along well?

01:16:57.779 --> 01:17:00.031
lt's better now,

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.241
but at times she's really stroppy,
Grandma.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:03.701
She's got a temper.

01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:05.578
How did you get along with her?

01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:09.957
When she was little,
she was the apple of my eye,

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:13.336
but as a teenager,

01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:16.130
for some reason l didn't know,

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:19.216
she grew away from me

01:17:20.177 --> 01:17:22.803
until l lost her completely.

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:26.182
Your mother didn't love me.

01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:32.438
lt really hurts when a daughter doesn't
love her mother.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:36.150
That's why,

01:17:36.234 --> 01:17:38.277
now that it's just the two of you,

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:40.571
you have to love her very much,

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:43.407
and she has to feel that.

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:45.242
Why have you come back?

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:50.081
Because l was very lonely.

01:17:54.127 --> 01:17:55.169
Good afternoon.

01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:56.962
Hello.

01:17:57.047 --> 01:18:00.007
l need eight meters of plastic clothesline

01:18:00.092 --> 01:18:02.009
and some packing tape.

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:03.094
How much tape?

01:18:03.178 --> 01:18:04.679
Four or five rolls.

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:06.847
Very well.

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:08.933
Five rolls.

01:18:11.561 --> 01:18:13.979
One...

01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:15.189
Two...

01:18:15.273 --> 01:18:18.067
And a pick and a shovel.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.610
Very well.

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:57.648
-Great!
-Bye!

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:01.861
How are you, Raimunda?

01:19:01.945 --> 01:19:02.945
Fed up.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:04.864
How's Agustina?

01:19:04.948 --> 01:19:05.990
Mad as a hatter.

01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:07.158
Hi, Mom!

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:11.328
-What's up with you?
-Nothing.

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.956
Fetch me a glass of water, love.

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:16.584
Do you mind if she stays here tonight?

01:19:16.668 --> 01:19:19.295
No, but where will she sleep?

01:19:19.337 --> 01:19:21.338
ln the spare room.

01:19:22.883 --> 01:19:25.676
Paco's coming over tonight.
He wants to talk.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:27.762
l'd like us to be alone.

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.014
All right.

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:33.517
You're sleeping here tonight.

01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:42.735
l'm off.
l've got a long night ahead of me.

01:20:13.308 --> 01:20:14.350
Hello.

01:20:15.894 --> 01:20:17.728
l need a favor tonight.

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.064
Tonight? Can't it wait until tomorrow?

01:20:20.106 --> 01:20:23.275
No, but l'll pay you, like any client.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:25.736
No, love, for you a discount,

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:29.240
but l didn't know you liked pussy.

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:30.366
l don't.

01:20:30.408 --> 01:20:35.079
So if you don't want to go muff-diving,
what do you want?

01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:36.622
l'll explain on the way.

01:20:36.706 --> 01:20:38.958
First, we have to put the freezer in the van...

01:20:39.042 --> 01:20:41.210
-What?
-And take it to a dung heap.

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:43.671
We can't carry that on our own!

01:20:43.755 --> 01:20:45.798
We'll ask the neighbors to help us.

01:20:45.882 --> 01:20:48.092
Put on something comfortable.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:49.802
Like what?

01:20:49.886 --> 01:20:51.595
You look like you're going to explode
in that.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.930
-Wait! Wait!
-Like this!

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:54.139
lt sticks out here.

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:56.934
Get it on the sidewalk.

01:20:56.977 --> 01:21:01.272
-lt's slipping!
-No, it's not.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:08.821
Get it parallel to that.

01:21:08.905 --> 01:21:12.241
Now, up! One, two, three!

01:21:14.786 --> 01:21:18.122
Come on! One, two, three!

01:21:18.164 --> 01:21:19.164
Push!

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:23.002
lt's in.

01:21:23.086 --> 01:21:25.796
Bloody hell.

01:21:26.172 --> 01:21:28.215
Did you hurt yourself?

01:21:28.508 --> 01:21:30.467
Who needs a spleen, anyway?

01:21:33.179 --> 01:21:34.847
Where are we going?

01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:37.975
To the Jucar River.

01:21:38.059 --> 01:21:39.602
Where's that?

01:21:39.644 --> 01:21:41.812
1 80 kilometers away.

01:21:41.897 --> 01:21:43.314
1 80 kilometers!

01:21:43.356 --> 01:21:46.066
lt'll take us all night
just to go and come back.

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:47.776
l said l'd pay by the hour.

01:21:47.819 --> 01:21:49.653
Just to go with you?

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.823
To come with me to the river, dig a hole,

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.200
bury the freezer, and not ask questions.

01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:57.912
Look, l appreciate your trust,

01:21:57.996 --> 01:22:01.123
but my life's complicated enough!

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:04.752
l have no job, no papers,
l have to work the streets to survive.

01:22:04.836 --> 01:22:06.670
Christ, you could have asked me!

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:09.256
l'm asking you now. How much?

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:10.883
You should've asked first.

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:15.638
All right,

01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:18.015
give me the nights.

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:19.892
What nights?

01:22:19.976 --> 01:22:22.853
The drinks at night, for a month.

01:22:22.896 --> 01:22:24.939
And l keep what l make from my cocktails.

01:22:25.023 --> 01:22:26.774
And you buy the bottles.

01:22:26.858 --> 01:22:28.901
All right, partner,

01:22:28.985 --> 01:22:30.569
but not a word about this.

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:34.698
What can l do? l'm your accomplice now.

01:22:34.783 --> 01:22:37.242
Just so you know, l haven't killed anyone.

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:39.036
Don't tell me anything.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.038
l wasn't going to.

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:21.829
Get out of the way. Give me that.

01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:40.055
Oh, my God!

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:45.394
l can't do any more, l'm dead.

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:48.022
Take a break, l'll fill this in.

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:53.212
What are you doing here?

01:24:56.007 --> 01:24:59.676
-Can we talk?
-l'm really busy.

01:24:59.719 --> 01:25:02.012
Come in.

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:10.687
-How are you?
-The same.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.690
-Have you found out anything?
-About what?

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:15.484
About what l asked you.

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:18.362
l didn't think you were serious.

01:25:19.989 --> 01:25:21.907
May l sit down?

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:28.372
Have pity on me.

01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:31.416
l do, all the pity you want,

01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:33.210
but don't ask crazy things.

01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:35.838
All l want is to know if she's alive or dead!

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:44.304
l understand that with the wind
and the cancer

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:45.848
you've lost your mind,

01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:48.475
but you can't complicate
other people's lives.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.811
We've got enough on our plates.

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:55.774
The day your parents died in the fire,

01:25:55.859 --> 01:25:58.026
my mother disappeared.

01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:05.075
Don't you think that's
a strange coincidence?

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.911
No, it's just a coincidence.

01:26:08.746 --> 01:26:11.915
You said your mother left in the morning

01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:14.585
and it wasn't the first time she disappeared.

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:18.672
Your grandmother had to raise you
because she was never at home.

01:26:18.756 --> 01:26:20.507
Don't make me say more.

01:26:20.592 --> 01:26:23.427
My mother went off that morning,

01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:26.597
but it was to join your father in the hut.

01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:28.765
That's a lie.

01:26:28.808 --> 01:26:31.185
-No one saw her.
-Of course not.

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:33.562
She made sure of that.

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:39.985
My mother was having an affair
with your father.

01:26:41.446 --> 01:26:42.821
What are you saying?

01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:47.993
My mother would never have allowed it!

01:26:48.077 --> 01:26:50.829
That's why she went to live
with your Aunt Paula.

01:26:50.914 --> 01:26:53.832
She did that because my aunt wasn't well,

01:26:53.917 --> 01:26:56.793
but she never left him.
She went between the two houses.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.587
You don't know, you weren't there,

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:01.548
and you hardly had any contact
with your mother for years.

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:04.635
l often heard her complain
you treated her like shit.

01:27:04.677 --> 01:27:06.053
Those were her words.

01:27:08.306 --> 01:27:10.140
l've heard a lot of things.

01:27:11.267 --> 01:27:13.185
Once

01:27:13.269 --> 01:27:15.938
l heard a row
between your mother and mine.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.649
Your mother told her she could have
your father,

01:27:18.691 --> 01:27:20.067
she didn't care.

01:27:20.151 --> 01:27:22.444
And she didn't envy her

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:25.739
because he'd been born to hurt
the women who loved him.

01:27:28.743 --> 01:27:30.994
What are you getting at?

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.581
That your parents' death

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:37.501
and my mother's disappearance
are connected.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:42.965
Then why haven't you gone to the police?

01:27:43.007 --> 01:27:45.425
They ask a lot of questions,

01:27:46.135 --> 01:27:49.054
and we should wash our dirty linen at home.

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:53.850
That's why l won't go on TV even though
my sister is insisting.

01:27:54.644 --> 01:27:57.354
You and l have to sort this out.

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:02.526
l have to get back to work.

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:08.031
Think about what l said.

01:28:08.866 --> 01:28:10.409
How's Paco?

01:28:11.202 --> 01:28:12.536
What?

01:28:13.204 --> 01:28:14.746
He's fine.

01:28:19.752 --> 01:28:22.879
Shouldn't we call Auntie
to say we're coming?

01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:24.715
She never goes out.

01:28:24.757 --> 01:28:26.174
We should warn her.

01:28:26.217 --> 01:28:27.718
Why?

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:31.430
lt's not polite just to turn up
at someone's house,

01:28:31.514 --> 01:28:33.181
even if she is your sister.

01:28:33.224 --> 01:28:35.225
What's up with you and Sole now?

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.562
lt's a question of manners.

01:28:38.604 --> 01:28:41.523
You and your aunt are getting
on my fucking nerves!

01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:43.275
You're so vulgar.

01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:50.490
What have you brought, Raimunda?

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.659
Food for the three of us.

01:28:57.206 --> 01:28:59.082
Why did you bother?

01:28:59.125 --> 01:29:01.460
Why are you shouting?
Are you going deaf?

01:29:01.544 --> 01:29:03.962
-Yes, l'm deaf.
-Deaf as a post.

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:07.007
We're staying a while,
l want you to cut my hair.

01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:09.801
Why didn't you call? l've got a client.

01:29:11.554 --> 01:29:14.222
Don't worry, l'm in no hurry.

01:29:14.265 --> 01:29:16.433
And we have to talk.

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:19.144
-About what?
-Aunt Paula's house.

01:29:19.228 --> 01:29:23.023
-May l go and watch TV?
-Yes, go on.

01:29:23.107 --> 01:29:26.401
We have to sort out all the paperwork.

01:29:27.945 --> 01:29:29.112
Grandma!

01:29:30.114 --> 01:29:31.114
l'm here.

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.283
Don't make a sound, my mother's here.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:34.785
l heard her.

01:29:40.666 --> 01:29:42.334
Where's the Russian?

01:29:42.418 --> 01:29:46.129
-Who's the Russian?
-A woman who's helping me.

01:29:46.172 --> 01:29:49.383
l was telling her about my son being
expelled again.

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:52.302
He slashed the tires of the priest
who teaches him religion.

01:29:52.387 --> 01:29:54.763
l was telling her, and she left me
talking to myself

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:56.723
with my hair half-washed.

01:29:56.808 --> 01:29:58.183
She must have gone out.

01:29:58.267 --> 01:30:00.936
l don't know, but she went off like a shot.

01:30:00.978 --> 01:30:02.646
l'll finish you off.

01:30:02.688 --> 01:30:05.148
She's got claustrophobia,

01:30:05.191 --> 01:30:07.484
and at times she needs to go outside.

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:09.152
Some help she is.

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:10.320
Do you pay her?

01:30:10.363 --> 01:30:13.073
No, l took her in.

01:30:13.157 --> 01:30:16.493
She eats and sleeps here.
l gave her Mom's clothes.

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:19.413
l don't like you taking in
people you don't know.

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:22.916
We told her that.
People take advantage of her.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.253
Look at the Russian.
She's living in luxury here.

01:30:26.337 --> 01:30:28.255
How was Paco the other night?

01:30:28.339 --> 01:30:32.092
Unpleasant. He came to get his clothes.

01:30:32.176 --> 01:30:36.179
l think he's living with someone,
but l couldn't care less.

01:30:36.222 --> 01:30:39.474
Why didn't you tell me you had a Russian?

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.602
l guess l forgot.

01:30:50.653 --> 01:30:54.489
That's Agustina!

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:56.783
wherever you are

01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:58.577
Good afternoon, Agustina.

01:30:58.661 --> 01:31:00.078
Good afternoon.

01:31:00.163 --> 01:31:01.621
We know from your sister

01:31:01.706 --> 01:31:04.833
that your mother was a single parent.

01:31:04.876 --> 01:31:09.045
My mother was a hippie.

01:31:10.756 --> 01:31:12.048
That's Agustina!

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:14.301
She never married.

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:16.386
So she practiced free Iove.

01:31:16.429 --> 01:31:18.638
Your mother had a friend

01:31:18.723 --> 01:31:21.558
who died the same day she disappeared.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:23.310
Yes.

01:31:23.394 --> 01:31:26.563
How did she die?

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:27.647
In a fire.

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:30.609
There are lots of fires in my village,

01:31:30.693 --> 01:31:32.486
because of the East wind.

01:31:32.570 --> 01:31:37.574
Agustina's village is the wonderful
Alcanfor de las lnfantas,

01:31:37.617 --> 01:31:39.743
which, according to statistics,

01:31:39.785 --> 01:31:42.579
has the highest rate of insanity
per inhabitant.

01:31:42.622 --> 01:31:46.541
Do you think that perhaps your mother
was mentally unbalanced?

01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:52.923
No, when my mother wasn't well,
as she was a hippie,

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:55.091
she'd leave the village.

01:31:55.176 --> 01:31:58.220
Until one day she left and never came back.

01:31:58.262 --> 01:32:02.390
Yes, that was almost four years ago.

01:32:02.433 --> 01:32:03.600
And that friend?

01:32:03.643 --> 01:32:05.769
We're very interested in that friend
who died

01:32:05.853 --> 01:32:09.439
the same day your mother disappeared.
TeII us about that.

01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:11.942
About what?

01:32:12.026 --> 01:32:16.863
We'd like you to tell us about
the woman who died in the fire.

01:32:16.948 --> 01:32:20.116
-You know there are rumors...
-I don't beIieve in rumors.

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:23.870
I'd like you to explain what you told
our producer.

01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:26.957
It was something important
about that woman and her husband

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:29.459
that Iinked them
to your mother's disappearance.

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:30.627
Is that true?

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.005
I'd rather

01:32:36.968 --> 01:32:38.385
not taIk about that.

01:32:38.469 --> 01:32:41.054
Those were suppositions of mine.

01:32:41.138 --> 01:32:46.476
But you're here to talk about
that woman and your mother.

01:32:46.561 --> 01:32:48.562
I've changed my mind.

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:50.272
she can't believe her sister

01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:53.775
What's wrong?
You look uncomfortable, a bit nervous.

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:56.903
l'd like to explain

01:32:56.988 --> 01:32:59.531
that Agustina is also here to tell us

01:32:59.615 --> 01:33:01.825
that she's got a terminal illness.

01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:03.785
lsn't that so?

01:33:03.828 --> 01:33:06.037
Agustina has got cancer.

01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:11.835
You've got cancer.

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:14.963
But don't be nervous, you're among friends.

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:17.424
A big hand for Agustina!

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.183
Agustina has got a special wish.

01:33:27.226 --> 01:33:29.811
To go to a clinic in Houston.

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:33.440
But to go to Houston,
you have to speak out.

01:33:33.524 --> 01:33:36.693
Remember, you made a commitment
to this channel.

01:34:04.597 --> 01:34:06.598
Agustina came to see me.

01:34:06.682 --> 01:34:08.475
She did?

01:34:08.559 --> 01:34:10.644
She insists that Mom appears to us.

01:34:10.728 --> 01:34:12.729
She wants me to ask her about her mother.

01:34:13.564 --> 01:34:16.149
She also said that when she disappeared,

01:34:16.233 --> 01:34:18.193
her mother was having an affair with Dad.

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:27.369
Do you know anything about that?

01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:29.663
No.

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:34.959
Well, Mom told me, after...

01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:38.505
After what?

01:34:38.589 --> 01:34:41.299
After she found out.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.137
Look at me.

01:34:49.266 --> 01:34:52.435
Are there things l should know and don't?

01:34:52.478 --> 01:34:54.187
Oodles.

01:34:55.439 --> 01:34:56.773
But if l tell you,

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:59.275
you'll be annoyed or you won't believe me.

01:35:00.152 --> 01:35:03.279
l promise l'll believe you
and l won't be annoyed.

01:35:04.949 --> 01:35:07.283
Mom's been appearing all the time.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:10.954
To whom?

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:12.288
Sit down.

01:35:18.129 --> 01:35:20.505
She was with Aunt Paula until she died.

01:35:20.589 --> 01:35:23.133
lt was she who called Agustina

01:35:23.175 --> 01:35:25.885
and opened the door so she could find
the body.

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:28.054
She put out the money
so they'd bring her bread

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:30.140
and left everything paid for the funeral.

01:35:30.182 --> 01:35:32.809
Did you do all that?

01:35:32.852 --> 01:35:34.477
Yeah.

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:37.480
Did Agustina tell you all that?

01:35:39.066 --> 01:35:40.525
You don't believe me.

01:35:42.319 --> 01:35:45.613
Agustina is crazy!

01:35:45.656 --> 01:35:47.615
Last time we saw Auntie

01:35:47.658 --> 01:35:50.535
you said yourself it was incredible

01:35:50.619 --> 01:35:54.497
that she could live like that,
with her mind gone and half-blind.

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:56.332
Remember?

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:58.793
Yes, l do, but what are you saying?

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:01.588
That she wasn't alone.

01:36:01.672 --> 01:36:06.217
Who do you think made the wafers
and put them in tupperwares,

01:36:06.302 --> 01:36:08.887
one for each of us?

01:36:08.971 --> 01:36:11.765
Who do you think took the dolls
and Auntie's valuables

01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:14.100
before the neighbors swiped everything?

01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:16.311
Now do you understand?

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:22.233
Have you seen her?

01:36:22.318 --> 01:36:24.027
Yes.

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:30.700
ls she, by any chance,

01:36:30.785 --> 01:36:31.868
the Russian?

01:36:31.911 --> 01:36:34.704
Yes.

01:36:35.956 --> 01:36:37.499
Where is she?

01:36:40.878 --> 01:36:42.045
ln there.

01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:12.826
Mom!

01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:14.744
What are you doing down there?

01:37:37.434 --> 01:37:40.186
Weren't you dead?

01:37:40.271 --> 01:37:44.357
l've come back to ask you to forgive me.

01:37:44.441 --> 01:37:48.027
l knew nothing about it.

01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:50.071
l never even imagined it.

01:37:54.451 --> 01:37:56.411
Come on, Paula!

01:38:11.468 --> 01:38:13.011
My little girl!

01:38:16.599 --> 01:38:19.267
The worst is over.

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:20.852
She's seen me,

01:38:20.936 --> 01:38:23.229
and she didn't reject me, did she?

01:38:23.314 --> 01:38:24.480
No.

01:38:26.191 --> 01:38:28.610
Did you really come back
to ask her to forgive you?

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:32.238
And also to be with you.

01:38:33.282 --> 01:38:36.159
Someday you can explain it all to me.

01:38:36.243 --> 01:38:41.915
Yes, and that day l hope you understand me

01:38:41.999 --> 01:38:43.875
and that you forgive me, too.

01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:13.655
l have to talk to her.

01:39:13.697 --> 01:39:15.615
Why don't we go back?

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.244
Now?

01:39:20.329 --> 01:39:21.621
Sure.

01:39:48.941 --> 01:39:52.568
-l've dreamt about this so often.
-So have l.

01:39:54.029 --> 01:39:56.155
l don't know where to begin.

01:39:57.241 --> 01:40:01.035
You're not a ghost, are you?
You're not dead.

01:40:01.078 --> 01:40:02.954
No, love, l'm not.

01:40:04.373 --> 01:40:06.582
That's such a relief.

01:40:06.625 --> 01:40:08.126
But even if l had died,

01:40:08.210 --> 01:40:10.753
l'd have come back to ask you to forgive me

01:40:10.796 --> 01:40:13.214
for not seeing what was going on.

01:40:13.882 --> 01:40:15.758
l was blind.

01:40:16.635 --> 01:40:20.013
l found out the day of the fire.

01:40:20.097 --> 01:40:22.098
Had you really left Dad?

01:40:22.182 --> 01:40:24.100
Yes.

01:40:24.143 --> 01:40:26.436
l couldn't stand his cheating.

01:40:27.396 --> 01:40:29.605
The afternoon of the fire,

01:40:29.648 --> 01:40:32.316
you rang and spoke to Auntie.

01:40:33.318 --> 01:40:35.611
As usual, you didn't ask for me.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.949
l got angry and told your aunt
you were heartless.

01:40:40.743 --> 01:40:43.286
As l kept badmouthing you,

01:40:43.829 --> 01:40:45.872
your aunt

01:40:45.956 --> 01:40:47.790
defended you

01:40:48.959 --> 01:40:50.960
and told me everything.

01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:59.844
That your father had abused you,

01:40:59.928 --> 01:41:03.514
that you'd gotten pregnant,

01:41:03.599 --> 01:41:05.516
and that Paula

01:41:05.601 --> 01:41:07.477
is your daughter

01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:09.395
and your sister.

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:13.399
l couldn't believe it.

01:41:13.484 --> 01:41:17.695
How could such a monstrous thing happen
in front of me

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.655
without me realizing it?

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:25.078
Then, l understood everything.

01:41:25.162 --> 01:41:28.247
l understood your silence

01:41:28.332 --> 01:41:29.624
and why you grew so distant.

01:41:30.793 --> 01:41:35.004
l understood why your father went
to Venezuela.

01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:39.675
He couldn't cope
with the shame of what he'd done.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.844
l understood

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:44.180
why, after marrying Paco,

01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:46.307
you went to Madrid

01:41:46.892 --> 01:41:49.560
and wanted nothing to do with us.

01:41:49.645 --> 01:41:52.647
l hated you for not noticing anything.

01:41:52.689 --> 01:41:55.983
And you were right, love.

01:41:56.026 --> 01:41:58.611
When l found out,

01:41:58.695 --> 01:42:01.948
l was like a wild thing.

01:42:02.032 --> 01:42:05.243
l went to the hut,
ready to scratch his eyes out!

01:42:05.327 --> 01:42:08.371
l found him asleep with Agustina's mother,

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:10.540
both of them worn out.

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:13.042
They didn't see me.

01:42:13.085 --> 01:42:15.753
l set fire to the hut.

01:42:15.838 --> 01:42:17.839
lt was a windy day,

01:42:17.881 --> 01:42:21.217
and in no time
the flames had devoured everything.

01:42:22.052 --> 01:42:24.345
They didn't have time to wake up.

01:42:26.056 --> 01:42:27.932
The ashes in your grave

01:42:28.016 --> 01:42:30.560
are those ofAgustina's mother?

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:32.728
Yes.

01:42:36.984 --> 01:42:38.568
Afterwards,

01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:43.656
l wandered the countryside for a few days,

01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:45.199
hiding,

01:42:45.242 --> 01:42:48.161
like an animal.

01:42:48.245 --> 01:42:49.704
l was going to give myself up,

01:42:49.746 --> 01:42:51.789
but first

01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:54.876
l went to Paula's house to see her.

01:42:55.794 --> 01:42:58.629
She was in a terrible state.

01:42:58.714 --> 01:43:01.132
When she saw me,

01:43:01.216 --> 01:43:03.926
she wasn't at all surprised.

01:43:03.969 --> 01:43:08.431
l came from the past, where she was living.

01:43:08.473 --> 01:43:12.518
She greeted me as if l had just gone
out the door.

01:43:13.854 --> 01:43:17.064
With the tragedy, she lost what little
reason she had.

01:43:17.107 --> 01:43:20.109
l couldn't leave her on her own,

01:43:20.152 --> 01:43:25.114
so l stayed and looked after her

01:43:25.157 --> 01:43:26.949
until she died.

01:43:30.996 --> 01:43:33.998
ln the village they think you're a ghost.

01:43:34.082 --> 01:43:37.126
That's the good thing
about such superstitious places.

01:43:37.211 --> 01:43:40.838
lt was easier for me to go along with them

01:43:40.923 --> 01:43:42.506
than to speak the truth.

01:43:42.591 --> 01:43:45.551
l thought l'd be arrested.

01:43:45.636 --> 01:43:49.096
l never imagined
that no one would investigate

01:43:49.139 --> 01:43:51.265
or punish me,

01:43:51.308 --> 01:43:54.477
although all this time

01:43:54.519 --> 01:43:57.813
l swear l've been in a living purgatory.

01:44:03.028 --> 01:44:04.570
Never better said.

01:44:24.925 --> 01:44:27.176
lt's too early to go to the village.

01:44:27.219 --> 01:44:28.803
We shouldn't arrive in daylight.

01:44:28.845 --> 01:44:31.597
Why don't we drive by the river?

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:33.808
lt's been so long since l saw it.

01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:36.352
lt's not what it was. lt's dry.

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:38.062
How do you know?

01:44:39.064 --> 01:44:42.191
Because there's a drought all over Spain.

01:44:42.234 --> 01:44:43.776
Don't you know?

01:45:03.005 --> 01:45:07.049
We used to come here for picnics.
Remember, Raimunda?

01:45:07.092 --> 01:45:08.968
Yes.

01:45:09.052 --> 01:45:11.762
There was more water then.

01:45:11.847 --> 01:45:13.848
l told you it was dry.

01:45:13.890 --> 01:45:15.808
Shall we eat something?

01:45:15.892 --> 01:45:17.935
Not for me.

01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:20.688
-l'm going to eat a wafer.
-Me too.

01:45:31.116 --> 01:45:33.409
This was your father's favorite place.

01:45:34.536 --> 01:45:35.995
Paco's?

01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:37.663
Yes.

01:45:39.416 --> 01:45:42.126
lt was the only thing he missed.

01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:43.419
This river.

01:46:03.774 --> 01:46:06.108
l'm glad he's resting here.

01:46:18.455 --> 01:46:20.247
Come on. Nobody'll see you now.

01:46:36.056 --> 01:46:38.641
lf Paula were alive

01:46:38.683 --> 01:46:41.102
and could see us now,

01:46:41.144 --> 01:46:43.145
all together,

01:46:43.188 --> 01:46:45.314
she'd be so happy.

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:54.448
Have you always had such a big chest?

01:46:55.367 --> 01:46:57.701
Yes, since l was little.

01:46:57.786 --> 01:47:00.496
l remembered you having less.

01:47:01.331 --> 01:47:03.290
Have you had anything done?

01:47:03.333 --> 01:47:05.459
No! What a thing to say!

01:47:05.502 --> 01:47:07.253
All right.

01:47:07.337 --> 01:47:09.463
Grandma, did you ride the bike?

01:47:09.506 --> 01:47:11.799
Yes, half an hour every day.

01:47:11.842 --> 01:47:13.926
lt's good for blood pressure and the heart.

01:47:14.010 --> 01:47:16.011
What did Aunt Paula say?

01:47:16.096 --> 01:47:19.682
She roared laughing.

01:47:21.977 --> 01:47:23.060
Bye.

01:47:26.565 --> 01:47:27.940
lt's Aunt Paula...

01:47:28.024 --> 01:47:29.692
Don't start.

01:47:30.652 --> 01:47:31.986
l'll get it.

01:47:32.821 --> 01:47:35.156
Hide Mom's plate and cutlery.

01:47:41.204 --> 01:47:44.081
-Who is it?
-Agustina.

01:47:47.419 --> 01:47:49.712
We're having supper. We've just arrived.

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:51.422
l'm sorry to bother you.

01:47:52.507 --> 01:47:54.216
Don't stay out there.

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:55.926
Thank you.

01:48:00.599 --> 01:48:02.391
Good evening.

01:48:03.852 --> 01:48:06.353
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.655
l came to apologize about the show.

01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:19.867
You shouldn't have done it.
lt wasn't right.

01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:21.076
l know that.

01:48:21.161 --> 01:48:23.078
lt's no excuse,

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:25.080
but they offered to take me to Houston.

01:48:25.123 --> 01:48:27.583
They cure everything there.

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:29.001
But l couldn't do it.

01:48:29.085 --> 01:48:33.214
l'd rather die alone in my house,
but at peace,

01:48:33.256 --> 01:48:35.591
and able to look you in the eye.

01:48:37.552 --> 01:48:41.472
-Mom, l'm going to bed, all right?
-Yes, go on.

01:48:43.391 --> 01:48:46.227
-Will you have some supper?
-No, thanks.

01:48:46.269 --> 01:48:49.605
l heard you're going to sell the house.

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:52.942
We'd thought about it, but now we're here...

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:55.611
There are so many memories.

01:48:55.695 --> 01:48:59.156
Well, l have to go.

01:48:59.241 --> 01:49:01.951
Why don't you stay a while?

01:49:01.993 --> 01:49:05.788
l have to go to the nurse to get my injection.

01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:08.958
ln Madrid they told me to learn
to do it myself,

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.210
but it gives me the creeps.

01:49:11.294 --> 01:49:15.297
Your sister is unforgivable.
Leaving you alone like this.

01:49:15.382 --> 01:49:17.174
Don't even mention her.

01:49:17.259 --> 01:49:20.553
As l didn't say what they wanted
on television,

01:49:20.637 --> 01:49:22.304
she's not speaking to me.

01:49:22.347 --> 01:49:26.016
She's very angry with me.
But l'm even angrier with her.

01:49:26.101 --> 01:49:28.018
With good reason.

01:49:28.103 --> 01:49:30.104
l envy you two.

01:49:30.981 --> 01:49:33.190
You're so close.

01:49:53.044 --> 01:49:55.337
lrene!

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:58.424
l've longed to see you.

01:49:58.508 --> 01:50:00.843
Here l am.

01:50:00.885 --> 01:50:02.511
l heard about your problem,

01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:05.723
and l can imagine how lonely you are.

01:50:05.807 --> 01:50:07.683
Very lonely.

01:50:11.271 --> 01:50:13.522
lf only Paula were here...

01:50:13.565 --> 01:50:16.233
l'm here to look after you.

01:50:16.318 --> 01:50:18.527
You left the door open.

01:50:18.570 --> 01:50:20.946
Don't worry, l closed it.

01:50:21.031 --> 01:50:22.823
Did you go to the nurse?

01:50:22.866 --> 01:50:25.534
No, l'm very tired. Tomorrow.

01:50:25.577 --> 01:50:28.787
Tomorrow you'll be in a lot of pain.

01:50:28.872 --> 01:50:31.707
Have you got the medicine and the needles?

01:50:31.791 --> 01:50:33.375
Yes, l bought it all in Madrid.

01:50:33.418 --> 01:50:36.003
Good, l'll give you the injection.

01:50:41.843 --> 01:50:43.969
l was born in this bed.

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:47.890
My mother slept here.

01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:52.227
And in this bed
we held your sister Paula's wake.

01:50:52.312 --> 01:50:54.438
l know,

01:50:54.522 --> 01:50:56.607
and l'm so grateful.

01:51:00.612 --> 01:51:03.572
We have to talk, lrene.

01:51:03.615 --> 01:51:06.075
About everything you want.

01:51:06.117 --> 01:51:08.577
But don't tell anyone l've come back.

01:51:08.662 --> 01:51:11.330
Don't worry.

01:51:12.707 --> 01:51:15.668
Thank you for not talking about me
on television.

01:51:17.128 --> 01:51:19.755
lt's our own business.

01:51:20.298 --> 01:51:22.091
That's right,

01:51:22.133 --> 01:51:24.301
and no one else's.

01:52:31.828 --> 01:52:35.164
Mom, it's me, let me in!

01:52:37.041 --> 01:52:39.626
What are you doing here? Come in.

01:52:41.004 --> 01:52:42.171
l missed you.

01:52:42.255 --> 01:52:46.467
-Are you going to stay here?
-Yes, until the end.

01:52:46.509 --> 01:52:48.135
Agustina is very ill.

01:52:48.178 --> 01:52:49.970
After what l did to her mother,

01:52:50.013 --> 01:52:52.848
the least l can do is look after her
until she dies.

01:52:52.932 --> 01:52:56.810
l have so much to tell you.

01:52:56.853 --> 01:52:59.396
l haven't told you about Paco
or what l've done.

01:52:59.481 --> 01:53:02.900
l'm dying to hear everything,
but go away now.

01:53:02.984 --> 01:53:06.695
l'll see you every day.
Between us we'll manage.

01:53:06.738 --> 01:53:07.821
Yes.

01:53:10.533 --> 01:53:12.659
l need you, Mom.

01:53:14.913 --> 01:53:18.415
l don't know how l lived all these years
without you.

01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.459
Don't say that.

01:53:20.543 --> 01:53:23.045
l'll start to cry,

01:53:23.129 --> 01:53:25.380
and ghosts don't cry.
