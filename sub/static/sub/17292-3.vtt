[Rebecca]
<i>Previously on </i>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:31.532 --> 00:33.450
-Josh!
<i>-I was in New York. I ran into Josh.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:36.495
<i>He made me feel warm inside,</i>
<i>like glitter was exploding inside me.</i>

00:36.578 --> 00:37.579
<i>Then, I moved here.</i>

00:37.663 --> 00:40.374
Josh and Rebecca are having sex
and basically living together.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.500
What?

00:41.583 --> 00:43.752
I am applying to law school!

00:43.835 --> 00:46.713
-[both screaming]
-Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:46.797 --> 00:49.758
<i>My dreams might actually come true.</i>

00:49.841 --> 00:52.302
I got a DUI, spent a night in jail.
Turns out I'm an alcoholic.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.596
I've been going to meetings
and I'm trying to stay sober. That's it.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.223
Bingo, bango, done. Beers?

00:56.306 --> 00:57.140
What's this?

00:57.224 --> 00:59.685
Okay. Just a simple contract
laying all the terms of our friendship.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.562
It stipulates that my services as a friend

01:01.645 --> 01:03.814
are limited to consultation and support,
and exclude shenanigans.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.651
Rebecca, I'm very glad you're welcoming
the opportunity to work on yourself.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.905
The reason I got a DUI
is because I was driving over

01:11.989 --> 01:14.116
the next morning
to tell you that I loved you.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.703
-Oh, my God.
-You and Josh... you're happy, right?

01:17.786 --> 01:21.623
-And he treats you well?
-Um... yes.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.251
I deserve to be with someone
who treats me well.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.669
Okay.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.755
Is that Greg's sweatshirt?

01:36.471 --> 01:38.932
I'm so hungry.
I can't wait for that pizza.

01:39.016 --> 01:41.643
-Yeah, me neither. I'm starving.
-Mm.

01:43.854 --> 01:45.230
Greg?

01:45.314 --> 01:48.233
-Greg, what are you doing?
-Yeah, what are you doing, Greg?

01:48.317 --> 01:50.652
Pizza in the bedroom? That's crazy.

01:51.862 --> 01:52.821
I hope you brought napkins.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.825
Oh! Come here, silly head.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.201
[both laughing]

01:58.285 --> 01:59.411
[sighs]

02:00.704 --> 02:04.833
Oh, God, this is great.
I was so torn between you two.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.169
Josh, I've loved you
since I was 16 years old,

02:07.252 --> 02:09.504
and, Greg, I thought you were
too damaged to love me.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.466
But now that you're in recovery,
you seem like a really viable alternative.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.801
It's so great
now that I don't have to choose.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.470
-Isn't it awesome?
-[laughs]

02:16.553 --> 02:20.432
Hey, before we dive into the 'za,
how about a three-way spoon sesh?

02:20.515 --> 02:22.476
-[both] Great idea!
-Yay!

02:24.770 --> 02:26.688
Hey, who gets to have sex with me tonight?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.815
You guys want to arm wrestle for it?

02:30.651 --> 02:33.362
-[both] Sure!
- Okay. Kiss time.

02:34.905 --> 02:37.783
<i>That's how it works when you have</i>
<i>two significant others at the same time.</i>

02:37.866 --> 02:39.117
Right?

02:41.036 --> 02:44.081
I was on BuzzFeed,
and I saw a listicle about polyamory.

02:44.164 --> 02:48.543
And it described it as "the ethical
and responsible practice in philosophy

02:48.627 --> 02:50.087
of loving multiple people."

02:50.962 --> 02:56.426
And then, it hit me. Josh, Greg, and I
could be a polyamorous throuple,

02:56.510 --> 02:58.387
like you guys,
since I can't choose between them.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.430
Um...

03:01.014 --> 03:05.769
This sort of relationship isn't a default
option for someone who can't choose.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.815
And it's definitely
not about arm wrestling for sex.

03:09.898 --> 03:13.110
You know, I thought you were writing
an article on us for <i>Psychology Today.</i>

03:13.192 --> 03:15.237
That's what it said on the Craigslist ad.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.449
Right. Okay. So, don't be mad at me,
but that was a straight up lie,

03:19.533 --> 03:21.243
but I still want to buy your TV stand.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.411
Okay, come on.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.162
Wait, wait. Please, please.
Don't go, don't go.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.916
Listen, I am legitimately torn.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.877
What you're describing is a love triangle.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.629
That's a completely different thing.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.257
A love triangle?

03:35.966 --> 03:37.801
I guess you're right. That is what I'm in.

-Okay.

07:16.102 --> 07:20.398
Rebecca, your approach
to this situation is fallacious.

07:20.482 --> 07:23.068
-Huh?
-Actually, there are two fallacies.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.321
One, neither man
is actually offering you a relationship.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.949
Uh, mm, is it neither or kinda both?

07:29.032 --> 07:31.952
And two, because of
your mental health issues,

07:32.035 --> 07:34.412
you shouldn't be
in a serious relationship at all.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.207
-But I'm in--
-You feel torn between two men,

07:37.290 --> 07:39.125
but it has nothing to do with those men.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.962
It has to do with your personal issues.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.047
No, you are wrong.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.926
I feel that it is my destiny
to be with one of these two men.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.220
If you're not gonna help me,
I know someone who will.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.931
Who? Dr. Geller?

07:53.014 --> 07:55.517
He's a hack. He got his degree
in a hotel conference room

07:55.600 --> 07:56.643
in Turks and Caicos.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.563
No, the universe, Dr. Akopian.

08:00.647 --> 08:04.317
Look, the whole reason I'm in West Covina
is because the universe sent me a sign.

08:04.401 --> 08:08.571
Literally, an arrow pointed straight down
to Josh on the street in New York.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.407
-You're gonna say that's a coincidence?
-Yes.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.659
Ugh, I know you want me to be so logical,

08:12.742 --> 08:15.620
but that's how I've lived my whole life
and I have been miserable.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.289
So, you know what?
I'm gonna let destiny take the wheel,

08:18.373 --> 08:20.458
like Jesus supposedly does sometimes.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.503
[exhales deeply]
And I feel so much better.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.506
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Akopian.

08:26.589 --> 08:30.218
You know what? I'm calling it.
We're done. Take the rest of the day off.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.970
I have other patients.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.889
You're good. You're really good.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.434
Is it even ethical
to keep taking her money?

08:39.310 --> 08:40.937
I want that kayak.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.529
[thinking] <i>Okay, universe, I'm ready.</i>
<i>Send me some signs.</i>

08:50.947 --> 08:54.534
<i>A karate outfit? Okay, that's a Josh sign.</i>

08:57.287 --> 09:00.457
<i>A whiskey bottle? Hm, could be Greg.</i>

09:00.540 --> 09:02.751
<i>Signs, signs, signs.</i> <i>Wait, there was </i>Signs 2 <i>and </i>3<i>?</i>

09:05.128 --> 09:06.796
<i>How did I miss those </i>Signs<i>?</i>

09:07.547 --> 09:09.841
<i>Ugh, this is so hard. So many signs.</i>

09:09.924 --> 09:11.551
<i>How am I supposed to make a decision?</i>

09:12.343 --> 09:14.929
You have made
a great decision, Mr. Serrano.

09:15.013 --> 09:18.308
And with my client's cash,
it'll be a seven-day close.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.810
Hello.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.020
-Dad?
-Yeah?

09:22.896 --> 09:26.232
Who is that lady?
What is she closing? What's going on?

09:26.316 --> 09:28.651
Greggy, I got great news.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.154
One of those house-flipping douches
knocked on the door last week,

09:31.237 --> 09:34.074
offered me ten times
what I paid for this piece of crap in '78.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.911
You sold the house?
Like, literally just now?

09:37.994 --> 09:40.205
-That was a transaction?
-Yup.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.041
You sold our house without telling me?

09:43.750 --> 09:44.918
Yup.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.047
But you didn't own it, jackass.
I'm being very generous.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.800
I'm giving you half the money,
so you can go to school.

09:51.883 --> 09:55.720
-What? You did what?
-Ain't that great? That's great, right?

09:56.721 --> 10:00.433
-I'm already in school.
-Your dream school, Emory, in Atlanta.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.311
You're always bragging about getting in.
So go, already.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.521
Now you can afford to.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.775
Dad, I'm trying to stay sober.
That's all that matters right now.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.193
[scoffs]

10:10.276 --> 10:12.612
Son, no, this is fate.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.240
The guy knocking on the door
was like a sign.

10:15.782 --> 10:19.577
Well, it wasn't like a sign.
He had a sign. It said, "I pay cash."

10:20.829 --> 10:22.247
I wouldn't have sold the house before,

10:22.330 --> 10:24.541
because I was waiting for you
to get your life together.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.459
You were waiting for me
to get my life together?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.962
I think I was waiting for you
to get your emphysema together.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.006
-You still have cigarettes here.
-Don't you pin this on me. I'm fine.

10:32.090 --> 10:34.300
I got a great place,
a retirement community,

10:34.384 --> 10:35.885
but not that retired.

10:35.969 --> 10:40.014
It's called Barely Seniors.
Singles scene is insane.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.475
So, while you're in Atlanta,
working on your MBA,

10:42.559 --> 10:45.270
I'm gonna be hitting on foxy widows
at a swim-up bar.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.272
-Swim-up bar? What--?
-Yeah.

10:47.355 --> 10:51.359
Dad, I can't just pick up and move across
the country out of nowhere. I'm not crazy.

10:52.110 --> 10:54.946
And I'm not supposed to make big changes
this early in recovery.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.490
I'm afraid to change my socks.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.034
I've been 28 days in these puppies.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.579
Well, it's your life.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.081
And do what you want to do,
but we don't live here anymore.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.626
And the money is yours.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.724
Ugh. Oh, I'm so confused.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.644
I mean, I've barely been sleeping
or eating, except for this sandwich.

11:26.728 --> 11:27.729
That was delicious.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.356
I don't want to hurt anybody,
but I have to know.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.026
Is destiny Team Josh or Team Greg?

11:33.109 --> 11:36.779
Because I keep getting signs for both.
It's exhausting.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.908
I just wish someone would tell me
what to do at this point, you know?

11:39.991 --> 11:41.826
-Not me. Not anymore.
-[phone dings]

11:41.910 --> 11:43.203
Oh, maybe this is something.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.164
Oh, no, it's just period day.

11:46.247 --> 11:50.709
Period day? Yay! Ovunation is the best.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.879
-Yeah, definitely worth the 1.99.
-[chuckles]

11:52.962 --> 11:55.506
Huh, it says we're supposed
to get our periods today.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.592
You got anything?
You know, the puffy boobs,

11:57.675 --> 12:01.512
migraines, cramps,
an urge to dip chips in frosting?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.097
[both]
Ooh....

12:03.181 --> 12:04.307
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.476
Um, I don't know.
Let me see what I got here.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.103
Yes. Oh, God, these puppies are sore.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.813
Our red friend must be on its way.

12:10.897 --> 12:11.940
Oh, thank God.

12:12.023 --> 12:13.732
-I'm so glad we cycle together.
-Mm.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.152
It's like we're our own
little blood coven.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.528
[both cackling]

12:17.612 --> 12:20.949
-Scatter, little boys! Scatter!
-[cackling]

12:22.741 --> 12:25.912
Yeah, it is kinda weird
that we're running a little late though.

12:25.995 --> 12:29.290
-Usually, it's like clockwork.
-You know what? It's probably my fault.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.793
I have been so stressed
about applying to law school.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.254
-Oh...
-I'm finally doing what I want to do.

12:34.337 --> 12:38.174
It feels great,
but it's also really scary.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.884
But you remember that scene
in <i>Working Girl</i>

12:39.968 --> 12:41.803
where the women walk to work
in their sneakers?

12:41.886 --> 12:42.720
Oh, yeah.

12:42.804 --> 12:46.516
And then, they change into,
like, little kicky Nine West pumps?

12:46.599 --> 12:47.600
-Yeah.
-Oh, God.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.270
I always wanted to be that girl.
[sighs]

12:50.353 --> 12:54.565
All my life people have been telling me
I couldn't, you know? And I am so close.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.988
Having to wait six months to find out
if I can have my dream is so hard,

13:00.071 --> 13:02.949
when I've been waiting my entire life.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.536
Wow. How long have you been
sitting on that speech?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.704
Twenty-four years.

13:07.786 --> 13:11.416
Mm. Paula, you can do it. Okay?
There's really no need to stress.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.959
-It's all gonna happen.
-Thanks, baby.

13:13.042 --> 13:16.587
Hello, ladies.
I got the Ovunation push notification.

13:16.671 --> 13:20.633
[chuckles]
So, I brought in your favorite chocolate.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.843
Oh.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.012
God, I gotta change my privacy settings.
Darryl, what are you wearing?

13:24.095 --> 13:25.972
Why are you exposing
your extremely white legs?

13:26.055 --> 13:28.807
Oh, well,
Wi-Jo and I went hiking together.

13:28.891 --> 13:32.061
We found this place in town
called Heritage Bridge.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.189
Have you ever been? It's so pretty.
And I've lived here for 15 years,

13:35.273 --> 13:37.233
never even knew it was there,
but that's the beauty of Wi-Jo.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.526
He helps me to see beauty

13:38.609 --> 13:40.528
that's been under my nose
from the very beginning.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.238
Blech!
[coughs]

13:42.322 --> 13:44.657
[laughs]
I get it. I get it.

13:44.741 --> 13:47.327
We're so sweet together
that it's almost nauseating.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.038
It's kind of funny.
It's true, but it's funny.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.789
No, Darryl, I legit just barfed.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.252
Oh, my God, I've got water mouth.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.173
Honey, are you okay?

14:01.424 --> 14:02.425
Paula...

14:03.968 --> 14:05.261
I'm pregnant.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.602
So, you think you're pregnant
because you hurled once?

14:13.436 --> 14:15.813
No, I'm pregnant because
I ate that egg salad sandwich.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.566
Yeah, honey, no one gets the egg salad
from the vending machine.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.818
It's all sweaty and gray.

14:20.902 --> 14:23.780
I mean, you gotta start
looking at your food before you eat it.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.866
No! Okay, Paula, when my mother
was pregnant, she could not eat egg salad.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.160
Just the thought of egg salad,
she would barf everywhere.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.329
It's on the list of things
I ruined for her.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.373
-Including her career and her vagina.
-Right. Okay.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.291
You don't think it's because
they ship those sandwiches

14:35.375 --> 14:36.542
in hot trucks from Colorado?

14:36.626 --> 14:37.960
-No.
-No.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.045
No, no, that's not it.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.048
All right. Look, if you think
you could be pregnant,

14:42.131 --> 14:45.718
then let's just-- let's just go get
a test, and then you'll know.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.220
I don't need a test.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.473
I know what I feel. Paula, don't you see?

14:50.556 --> 14:54.060
Wait... [laughs]
Paula, don't you see?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.020
-Don't you see what's happening here?
-No.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.939
This baby is a sign.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.191
The universe got back to me!

15:00.274 --> 15:03.569
Thanks, universe! Oh, my God. It's like
everything was a test and ding-ding-ding!

15:03.653 --> 15:05.279
The baby is the answer, A plus.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.949
[stammering] Yeah, I'm just--
I'm not following you, like, at all.

15:08.032 --> 15:10.993
Okay, okay, okay. Paula,
I put my intention out in the universe,

15:11.077 --> 15:13.496
and now, the universe is telling me
exactly what I should do.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.707
I mean, the baby can only be Josh's.
Ask Ovunation.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.751
It's his and if I'm having Josh's baby,

15:18.835 --> 15:21.587
it means that Josh and I
are meant to be together.

15:21.671 --> 15:25.925
It would be crazy to think that Greg and I
were meant to raise Josh's baby, right?

15:26.008 --> 15:29.637
[laughing] Oh, my God.
Oh, honey, I am so worried about you.

15:29.720 --> 15:34.142
Okay? So, I am just gonna pop out
and get you a test, mm-kay?

15:34.225 --> 15:36.310
And then, we'll just--
we'll go from there.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.147
Having Josh's baby.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.316
Okay.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.112
I hear ya. I hear you, universe,
loud and clear.

15:51.993 --> 15:53.536
So what do I do, Guard?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.371
Can I call you that instead of Guardrail?

15:55.455 --> 15:58.207
It's just one extra syllable
to make it right.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.292
Make the effort.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.793
I hear you. Guardy.

16:00.877 --> 16:01.794
Hm.

16:01.878 --> 16:02.920
Guardrail.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.508
Listen, my father has literally
handed me my dreams

16:07.592 --> 16:10.344
on a silver platter
that's not quite as expensive.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.638
Like a bronze platter.
He actually doesn't even own a platter. He once served cheese and crackers
to me on a Frisbee.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.478
-Point is, I can't do it.
-Why?

16:18.561 --> 16:21.606
'Cause it goes against
the "big changes" rule, in the book.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.484
-In our book. In our book.
-Those are guidelines.

16:24.567 --> 16:27.653
There's only one hard and fast rule.
Don't drink.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.031
Look, there's meetings in Atlanta.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.784
And for a sponsor, I can set you up
with one of the best retired winos,

16:33.868 --> 16:35.161
my friend Barry.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.038
He didn't get a cool biker name?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.832
He's an actuary.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.751
Be careful about stereotyping, okay?

16:42.627 --> 16:44.253
Greg, I can't tell you what to do,

16:44.337 --> 16:46.881
but this sounds like an opportunity
you've been waiting for.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.549
Maybe that is more important.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.968
Are you sure? What should I do?

16:51.052 --> 16:52.845
I can't tell you what to do.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.598
Seriously, just tell me what to do.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.308
Literally, just told you I can't.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.810
-You could write it down.
-Nope.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.312
-You could send me a text.
-Stop it.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.439
What if you told those people
and they told me?

17:03.523 --> 17:05.233
-What?
-[whispering] Tell me now.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.068
I'm gonna go.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.780
-Hi!
-What's going on?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.532
You sent me 17 texts to come over.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.034
I am so happy to see you.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.619
[chuckles]

17:16.702 --> 17:19.372
Also, it's not coming over.
It's coming home, so...

17:20.373 --> 17:23.960
-Whoa, tiger.
-I just feel so close to you right now.

17:27.630 --> 17:28.714
[laughs]

17:28.798 --> 17:32.176
-Wow, I'm so glad I came over-- home.
-Yeah, baby.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.309
-Wait, hold on.
-What? What?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.228
-What is that?
-Oh, no. Look at those later.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.312
-That's for later.
-What?

17:44.355 --> 17:45.565
Uh...

17:50.444 --> 17:53.072
Prenatal vitamins?

17:54.782 --> 17:57.535
I'm sorry. I didn't want you
to find out this way.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.120
I was gonna tell you after we made love.

18:00.204 --> 18:04.000
What? Wait, are you telling me
that you're pregnant?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.376
Okay.
[giggles]

18:05.459 --> 18:08.254
So, Josh, I know this is big,
this is really big,

18:08.337 --> 18:10.256
but we've been so unsure
about what's happening between us.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.676
And now, destiny has
intervened right here.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.636
I mean, think about it.
I'm on birth control.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.806
You used a condom.
Like, this is basically a miracle.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.476
This baby is a sign
that we're meant to be a family.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.647
You should sit down. You should sit down.
Sit down, sit down. This is big.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.233
Do you need a glass of water or--?
Yeah, this is hard.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.901
Listen, I'm not saying this isn't hard.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.195
This is gonna be the hardest thing
we will ever have to do.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.156
But it's gonna be worth it.
You know why? Jeronica. What do you think of that name?

18:37.199 --> 18:39.827
If it's a girl, Jeronica.
It's like the J names in your family.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.580
And Josh Junior if it's a boy, of course.
Or Jeremiah. I really like Jeremiah.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.956
Hold on. I have to pee.

18:45.791 --> 18:50.212
-[exhaling rapidly]
-[door opens, closes]

18:54.675 --> 18:57.845
-[toilet flushes]
-[door opens, closes]

18:57.928 --> 18:59.764
Okay. So, change of plans.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.141
I just got my period,
so I am not pregnant.

19:02.224 --> 19:03.434
Wow. This has been quite a day.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.561
Sorry to stress you out,
but the good news is,

19:05.645 --> 19:08.606
now, we can have some period sex.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.441
[sensual music playing]

19:15.279 --> 19:18.199
<i>♪ Period sex, period sex ♪</i>

19:18.282 --> 19:21.160
<i>♪ Put down a towel, party 'til it's dry ♪</i>

19:21.243 --> 19:24.205
<i>-♪ With some period sex, period sex ♪</i>
-Stop it!

19:25.956 --> 19:28.542
What just happened?

19:28.626 --> 19:30.670
I walked in the door. Everything was fine.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.505
But then, you were pregnant.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.675
Then, my life started flashing
before my eyes. Then, you weren't.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.009
I...

19:37.093 --> 19:40.221
-Okay, I need some air. Some air.
-Hey, hey. Josh, wait.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.307
No. No, Rebecca, I need more than air.
I can't do this.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.226
Do you mean the period sex?
It's not gross.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.770
-I'll just get a dark towel.
-It's not the period sex!

19:47.853 --> 19:53.734
Rebecca, the last three minutes have been
the most upsetting of my life.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.778
But I thought
that you would be happy about--

19:55.861 --> 19:57.863
It's not-- It's not just that.

19:57.947 --> 20:01.534
This confirms what I've been feeling.
I've been so unsure about us.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.786
What just happened, that's a sign.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.748
-A sign of what?
-That we need to stop doing this.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.542
This is all wrong.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.293
-Wrong? It's not wrong.
-It was just-- okay.

20:11.377 --> 20:15.047
It was just a casual thing,
but then I started leaving my stuff here.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.926
And it's just too much, Rebecca.
I gotta go.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.805
What are you doing? Wait, wait, wait.
You're coming back, right?

20:22.888 --> 20:25.099
This is just a fight. This is a fight.
All couples fight.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.183
No, it's not.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.439
And we're not a couple, Rebecca. What?

20:33.357 --> 20:34.608
I'm sorry.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.068
Sorry for what? Sorry for what?

20:39.989 --> 20:41.782
I don't want to see you anymore.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.120
Josh...

20:47.997 --> 20:49.874
-Hey, no, Josh!
-[door closes]

21:09.602 --> 21:10.770
Oh, hey, honey.

21:10.853 --> 21:14.315
Listen, I got you a test.
Um, I wanted to bring it by last night,

21:14.398 --> 21:17.568
but I was respecting
our legally binding friendship contract.

21:17.651 --> 21:18.778
I'm not pregnant.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.615
And Josh broke up with me.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.326
No. Honey, I'm so sorry.

21:25.409 --> 21:28.996
-So my womb is empty, like my life.
-Oh, no. Okay.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.498
Maybe this is for the best.

21:30.581 --> 21:33.042
No. Come on, this love triangle thing,

21:33.125 --> 21:35.377
the bouncing back and forth, I mean...

21:35.461 --> 21:38.464
-It's exhaust-- You are exhausted.
-Mm.

21:39.215 --> 21:43.511
Why don't you take a break? Okay?
Spend a little time on yourself.

21:44.261 --> 21:47.348
I mean, I think that would be healthy.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.185
Yeah. You know what? You're right.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.103
Ugh, that whole sign thing.

21:53.187 --> 21:56.148
That was so stupid!
I don't know why I even came to work.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.317
I gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna go on a walk.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.946
-You want some company?
-No. No, no. I have to be alone.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.490
And plus, our mutual periods
might attract vultures.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.579
She got her period.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.463
[exhales]

22:24.927 --> 22:27.596
Scott, meet me at home.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.057
You're both leaving?

22:30.140 --> 22:32.685
You know, you guys can't
just leave all the time.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.187
Can I come?

22:37.940 --> 22:40.234
Next time.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.243
You've been looking at this thing
for 15 minutes.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.328
It's not gonna pee on itself.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.122
Uh, I don't want to know.

22:53.205 --> 22:54.248
The longer I wait,

22:54.331 --> 22:56.292
the longer I can pretend
this isn't happening,

22:56.374 --> 22:58.085
and the more wine I can drink.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.670
Paula, you're probably not pregnant.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.464
You're only a couple days late
and we use protection.

23:02.548 --> 23:04.425
Oh, God, this makes so much sense.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.136
[chuckles]
I mean, this is what happens to me, right?

23:07.219 --> 23:08.804
I finally decide to apply to law school,

23:08.888 --> 23:11.765
and that bitch fate
just gets me knocked up.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.935
God, why did we decide to have sex again?
It was such a mistake. If you're pregnant,
we'll figure out how to deal with it.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.566
-Everything will be fine.
-[scoffs]

23:20.649 --> 23:23.152
We don't have the money
for another kid

23:23.235 --> 23:28.115
and law school and food
and Brendan's parole officer Payola.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.953
Oh, I was gonna spread my wings.

23:33.037 --> 23:36.999
Yeah, I was gonna spread my wings
and fly. I'm so stupid.

23:37.666 --> 23:41.003
No, no, no. No, no. My dad was right.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.547
I'm a breeder, not a leader.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.634
-That's a weird saying.
-I know.

23:46.717 --> 23:49.011
Paula, just take the test
and we'll go from there.

23:49.094 --> 23:52.430
I can't. I can't take the test
right now, okay?

23:52.514 --> 23:56.352
I'm gonna go back to work,
and I will think about this later.

24:36.684 --> 24:37.685
Greg?

24:39.061 --> 24:42.439
-Hey, what are you doing here?
-Rebecca. This is weird.

24:42.523 --> 24:43.524
Yeah.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.694
I just needed a walk.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.238
A lot of hours to fill
when you're not drinking.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.365
Also, I've saved so much money,
I bought these shoes.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.533
Oh!

24:52.616 --> 24:54.243
How'd you end up here?

24:54.326 --> 24:58.622
I also needed a walk. I found out about it
from Darryl. He and Wi-Jo come here a lot.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.752
-God, they're a great couple.
-Yeah. God, I ship them so hard.

25:03.836 --> 25:04.920
Yeah, they're really cute.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.549
Crazy that we both end up here
at the exact same time.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.384
What are the chances of that happening?

25:11.051 --> 25:14.346
I don't know.
I think it's just a coincidence.

25:14.430 --> 25:17.391
I used to think that coincidences
like this were like signs.

25:17.474 --> 25:20.728
-Like, when you were a little girl?
-No, like, an hour ago.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.229
Ah! How you've grown.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.441
-Yeah, I was so much shorter back then.
-Is that even possible?

25:25.523 --> 25:27.276
-[babbling]
-[fake laughing]

25:31.155 --> 25:33.407
This place is so beautiful. We...

25:34.324 --> 25:36.785
We should've come here,
a place like this when we were together.

25:36.869 --> 25:40.205
-Why didn't we do that?
-'Cause we hated the outdoors

25:40.289 --> 25:41.957
and each other most of the time?

25:42.041 --> 25:46.086
Right, right, right.
Two pillars of any great relationship.

25:46.170 --> 25:49.173
-Yeah, we were great.
-[giggles]

25:49.256 --> 25:53.802
All right, I should get back to work.
I, um... I'm literally never there.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.971
-It's a miracle I'm not fired.
-[chuckles]

25:56.055 --> 25:57.639
It was nice to see you.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.602
-I've missed you.
-Yeah, me too.

26:03.187 --> 26:06.690
This was a great fate-less,
coincidental meeting on a scenic bridge.

26:11.445 --> 26:14.615
Okay. I'm gonna...

26:16.325 --> 26:18.118
-Okay. Bye.
-Wait, Rebecca.

26:18.202 --> 26:19.203
Yeah?

26:31.632 --> 26:34.259
So, you were right.

26:34.343 --> 26:37.387
You told me to stop looking for signs
and I did just that.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.015
I'm glad to hear that, Rebecca.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.684
And it was when I stopped
looking for signs...

26:42.768 --> 26:44.311
that I got the biggest sign of all.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.687
Oh, Lord.

26:53.153 --> 26:57.491
Yeah. He kissed me,
and in that moment, I realized...

26:57.574 --> 27:00.494
It's him, Dr. A. It's always been Greg.

27:00.577 --> 27:01.619
Mm.

27:01.703 --> 27:05.582
Let me float an idea out there, and I know
you have every reason to say no, but...

27:06.959 --> 27:09.086
can we try this again, please?

27:10.212 --> 27:11.213
Rebecca--

27:11.296 --> 27:13.340
I know there's a lot of water
under the bridge. And I'm not just talking
about the water under this bridge.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.762
There's a drought. Why is there
so much water under this bridge?

27:18.846 --> 27:23.058
Okay. If we try this again,
if we take it slow,

27:23.142 --> 27:24.601
if we act like adults this time...

27:24.685 --> 27:27.645
-But what about--?
-Josh? Josh is done. That was nothing.

27:27.729 --> 27:28.856
It's done, I swear.

27:28.939 --> 27:30.816
Think about how
this story has played out. I moved to West Covina,
in love with someone else,

27:32.860 --> 27:35.612
and he's the sarcastic messed-up bartender
that calls me out on my stuff,

27:35.696 --> 27:37.489
and I ignore him,
but we have undeniable chemistry.

27:37.573 --> 27:40.117
And now, Josh and I break up.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.535
[snaps fingers]

27:41.618 --> 27:42.870
And it's about me and Greg.

27:42.953 --> 27:44.538
If you want to start over...

27:45.873 --> 27:50.460
I'll be here in this exact spot
tomorrow night at sunset.

27:50.544 --> 27:52.963
And if you're here, then we can walk over

27:53.046 --> 27:55.257
to that adorable mom and pop
Italian place.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.508
The Olive Garden?

27:56.592 --> 27:58.969
The Olive Garden, yes, and...

27:59.052 --> 28:01.679
we'll just-- I don't know-- start over,
pretend we never met,

28:01.763 --> 28:03.891
and forget all the bad stuff.

28:05.100 --> 28:09.354
Okay? Just... Just think about it.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.360
I mean, duh! It's the other guy.

28:15.444 --> 28:19.156
It's the guy who was under my nose
all along, that I underappreciated.

28:19.239 --> 28:23.202
I mean, him and me getting together,
it's the most obvious thing in the world.

28:23.994 --> 28:27.039
Do you listen to anything I say, ever?

28:27.122 --> 28:29.707
-Yes. I'm so glad you agree with me.
-Yup.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.461
[sighs] I'm gonna go fall in love
at the Olive Garden.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.254
Mm.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.382
[door opens, closes]

28:37.466 --> 28:41.720
Kayak, Noelle.
Remember the kayak.

28:41.803 --> 28:43.055
[inhales deeply]

28:53.398 --> 28:54.441
So...

28:55.150 --> 28:57.778
Beans said that you could
just keep all this stuff at his house?

28:57.861 --> 29:01.114
Yeah. He's got a dog mausoleum
with some extra space, so...

29:01.198 --> 29:04.701
-Until I find a permanent place to live.
-Here? In West Covina?

29:04.785 --> 29:09.248
Uh, not necessarily.
Maybe El Monte or Glendora.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.460
Dad, I told you.
I can't leave because of my recovery.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.545
-Recovery.
-Yeah.

29:15.629 --> 29:16.588
Right.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.261
This is why you're staying.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.222
God, you're so dramatic.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.891
You gotta wave that around?
"I've got exhibit A"?

29:27.975 --> 29:30.644
This is not why you're staying?
You're not staying for this girl?

29:31.270 --> 29:35.399
You are. And isn't that against the rules
of your group too? New relationships?

29:35.482 --> 29:39.027
They're guidelines, not rules.
And it's not a new relationship.

29:39.111 --> 29:42.072
We're gonna take things slow,
see how things go--

29:42.155 --> 29:44.574
Maybe we should celebrate
your staying in town by having a drink.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.076
-Dad, stop.
-You get back with Rebecca,

29:46.159 --> 29:47.703
you might as well hit the bottle again.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.956
Yeah? She jerks you around,
and you fall for it every time.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.249
She was figuring out her feelings.

29:52.332 --> 29:55.919
Oh, God, would you listen to yourself?
You're poison for each other.

29:56.003 --> 29:59.923
She's bad for you and you're bad for her.
You have to know that.

30:00.007 --> 30:02.426
Whole lot of parenting
late in the game, dad.

30:02.509 --> 30:03.802
I gotta keep packing.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.277
[sighs]

30:25.824 --> 30:27.200
Congratulations!

30:27.284 --> 30:28.744
What? What did you see?
It could be negative.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.412
What?

30:32.998 --> 30:34.166
Darryl, what do you want?

30:34.249 --> 30:36.585
Oh, I have great news.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.503
So, I overheard you saying the other day

30:38.587 --> 30:40.589
that you didn't want to wait around
to hear from law school.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.424
You wanted to start right away.
So I thought about it,

30:42.507 --> 30:46.845
and I realized that I knew someone
from the school where you applied.

30:47.763 --> 30:51.183
Don't make a big deal out of it,
but I know... the dean.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.893
Mm-hmm.

30:52.976 --> 30:56.063
And we actually know each other.
We're not just, like, LinkedIn friends.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.023
-Okay.
-Yeah.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.776
Anyway, so I called him and I asked him
about rolling admissions,

31:00.859 --> 31:03.153
and I pulled a few strings,

31:03.236 --> 31:07.366
and... you start this semester.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.205
This semester!

31:13.288 --> 31:14.831
This semester!

31:14.915 --> 31:18.251
-[party horns blowing]
-[laughing]

31:22.839 --> 31:25.467
Nothing can stop you, Paula.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.635
Not anymore.

31:31.056 --> 31:35.185
Oh, my God. What-- What is that?
Are those-- those tears of joy, right?

31:35.268 --> 31:37.396
[sobbing]
Mm-hmm.

31:37.479 --> 31:38.939
[laughs]

31:39.022 --> 31:40.023
Maya, get the present.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.860
Maya, get with the program,
you millennial!

31:43.944 --> 31:45.821
Sorry, I got distracted by the crying.

31:45.904 --> 31:49.282
Maya! No one cares! Get the box!

31:50.492 --> 31:51.326
[chuckles]

31:56.164 --> 31:59.000
Nine West heels,
just like Melanie Griffith.

32:01.878 --> 32:05.257
[sobbing]

32:05.340 --> 32:08.718
It's okay. It's okay. I'm her best friend.
I know exactly what to do.

32:09.886 --> 32:12.556
Hey, what's the matter, sweetie? Huh?

32:12.639 --> 32:17.018
What can I do to make it better?
Do you want me to fire Maya? Huh?

32:17.102 --> 32:19.521
-I don't really like her anyway.
-You know what?

32:19.604 --> 32:22.482
-What?
-It's not that.

32:22.566 --> 32:26.278
[laughs]
I have something I have to do. Um...

32:27.696 --> 32:29.448
But listen...

32:29.531 --> 32:32.868
Thank you, everybody, for this party

32:32.951 --> 32:35.871
and these shoes.

32:35.954 --> 32:41.293
And thank you, Darryl.
You have been such a great friend.

32:42.085 --> 32:46.339
-Your best friend?
-I mean, you made my dreams come true.

32:46.423 --> 32:49.050
Like a best friend. You can say it.
Just say it, please?

34:28.525 --> 34:29.568
[grunts]

34:44.457 --> 34:45.584
What?

34:49.796 --> 34:51.256
[sighs]

34:51.339 --> 34:53.049
Well, this is fun.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.637
It's hard, man. You're moving.
You just sprung this on us.

34:57.721 --> 35:02.100
Yeah, this is huge. This is so huge.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.228
[car alarm beeps]

35:14.529 --> 35:16.781
Guys, Atlanta's not that far,

35:16.865 --> 35:18.742
and I'll still be back
for Christmas and stuff.

35:18.825 --> 35:19.993
My dad's still here.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.413
I can't believe this is really happening.
No one ever leaves this place.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.707
I just don't understand
why you have to go right now,

35:25.790 --> 35:27.167
like, right this second.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.711
I'm starting a Tuesday-Thursday
6:00 a.m. boot camp in the park,

35:29.794 --> 35:31.421
and I just-- I really think
you'd benefit from it.

35:31.504 --> 35:33.173
Guys, it's time.

35:33.882 --> 35:39.346
I need to get to Atlanta, get settled in,
meet Barry, all before my classes start.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.598
Barry sounds like a great guy.

35:41.681 --> 35:44.559
Guardrail and I really think
he'll be there for you.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.644
Thanks, Chris.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.522
[Rebecca]
Come on, come on!

35:50.273 --> 35:52.108
Oh, my God.

35:52.192 --> 35:53.360
Why don't people use--?

35:53.443 --> 35:55.737
Okay. Mm!

35:56.363 --> 35:57.364
I gotta go, man.

35:57.447 --> 36:00.158
My mom's waiting outside,
and she's parked in the red zone.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.329
[both caw]

36:05.580 --> 36:07.832
Thanks for being my weirdly older friend.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.626
No problem, man. Anytime.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.880
Well, I should head to the gate.

36:13.963 --> 36:16.925
I gotta go. My mom's also in the red zone.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.221
Yeah.

36:24.766 --> 36:28.895
Wi-Jo, I hope to be
half the man you are someday.

36:28.978 --> 36:31.481
You're gonna have to up
your protein intake quite a bit.

36:31.564 --> 36:33.983
Maybe start doing some squats.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.277
Oh, you meant that metaphorically.

36:37.237 --> 36:38.321
Um...

36:38.405 --> 36:40.824
-That's nice. Thanks, man.
-No problem.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.787
What are you doing--? Oh, come on!

36:45.870 --> 36:48.748
Come on, just go! Go, go, go!

36:57.549 --> 37:00.343
You're the first friend
I ever made in my whole life.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.390
I feel like part of me
is leaving town, too.

37:07.559 --> 37:11.604
If it gets too rough,
you can come back, you know.

37:11.688 --> 37:14.482
You know, I did that.
No one will judge you.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.360
I did. I judged you.

37:18.111 --> 37:19.195
[scoffs]

37:20.113 --> 37:21.448
Kidding.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.662
-You're not coming back, are you?
-I don't think so.

37:28.788 --> 37:30.123
But thanks.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.417
Thanks for being a good friend, Chan.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.377
Are you crazy?

37:35.253 --> 37:37.464
I haven't been a good friend to you
in, like, months.

37:38.590 --> 37:41.634
After all the Rebecca stuff,
I can't even believe you still talk to me.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.429
It's okay.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.143
You sure?

37:51.186 --> 37:52.187
Yeah.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.568
All that's in the past now.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.290
I'm coming, Greg.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.056
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Sorry.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.350
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

38:33.394 --> 38:35.188
Greg, wait! Wait, wait!
