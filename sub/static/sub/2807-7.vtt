00:05.296 --> 00:10.259
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors!

00:10.427 --> 00:11.593
You did the windows!

00:11.761 --> 00:14.388
I have been begging for months
and you did, you cleaned!

00:14.556 --> 00:19.685
- And nagging works!
- No, uh, I didn't actually do this.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.479
Oh, no. Was I cleaning
in my sleep again?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.357
No, it wasn't you.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.277
- Well, then, who?
- I got a maid. Yay!

00:29.779 --> 00:33.157
Oh, well, I hope by "maid,"
you mean "mistress"...

00:33.324 --> 00:35.409
...because if some other woman
was cleaning...

00:35.577 --> 00:39.455
Now, honey, I know you don't like
to relinquish control.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.915
"Relinquish" is just
a fancy word for "lose."

00:42.751 --> 00:44.168
Look, she's really nice, okay?

00:44.335 --> 00:49.089
And she mentioned that she adored
the way that you arranged the sponges.

00:50.633 --> 00:51.800
Did she really say that?

00:51.968 --> 00:55.137
Yes, I distinctly remember
because I thought it was a joke.

00:55.513 --> 00:59.433
- Now, just give her a chance, okay?
- Fine, I can do it.

01:00.268 --> 01:01.727
Whoo.

01:01.895 --> 01:06.315
- What's the matter?
- Usually when I'm anxious, I clean.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.778
Whose cell phone is that?
It's just so annoying.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.489
- Everywhere you go.
- I think it's coming from your bag.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.286
I never get calls!

02:01.830 --> 02:03.539
Hello?

02:03.706 --> 02:09.919
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween
party. Ursula's fiancÃ©.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.674
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
Wait, how'd you get this number?

02:13.842 --> 02:17.136
I have a friend who's a cop,
and he got it.

02:17.303 --> 02:21.890
Wow. What an incredible violation
and wonderful surprise!

02:22.559 --> 02:25.644
I just... I thought you should know
I broke up with Ursula.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.647
Oh, you did?
He did it, he did it!

02:28.815 --> 02:30.816
- Wow, what did he do?
- Shh! I'm talking.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.528
Anyway, I was wondering...

02:34.696 --> 02:39.491
...if you were the sort of person
who eats lunch?

02:40.577 --> 02:42.119
Are you asking me out?

02:42.287 --> 02:46.248
Because it'd be weird since you
just broke up with my sister.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.918
Yeah, um, okay.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.879
I'm sorry. Bye.

02:52.046 --> 02:55.674
No, wait! I was just saying that
so you'd think I was a good person.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.178
Fight for me!

02:59.345 --> 03:03.140
Uh, I won't take no for an answer.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.893
Not great, we can work on it at lunch.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.188
Okay, um, I can be at your apartment
in two hours.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.024
Great. Uh, how do you know where I live?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.151
I've got friends too.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.195
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.489
Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!

03:19.657 --> 03:24.286
Oh, this day is gonna be much better
than I thought it was gonna be. Heh.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.371
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.045
So apparently I'm available
for lunch.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.923
Can't, I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.633
You're moving?

03:37.800 --> 03:40.761
I can't live with Joey
once the baby comes.

03:40.929 --> 03:45.098
I don't want my child's first words
to be, "How you doing?"

03:46.684 --> 03:49.061
So does Joey know you're moving?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.772
I haven't discussed it,
but he's gonna be relieved.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.815
Last week he brought this girl over...

03:53.983 --> 03:56.860
...and I started talking to her
about morning sickness.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.571
Then I showed her pictures
from my pregnancy book.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.115
- That's not really porn.
- Not so much.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.702
You know what?
If you're looking for a place...

04:05.870 --> 04:09.748
...I heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.

04:09.916 --> 04:15.087
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.882
Well I don't know.
But how great would that be, huh?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.509
You living in my building?

04:20.677 --> 04:24.972
I could take care of the baby,
I could come over whenever I want...

04:25.139 --> 04:26.723
...with your permission.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.934
- That really would be great.
- Yeah.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.811
Well, can we see it?

04:30.979 --> 04:34.731
Oh, maybe we shouldn't. If she
just died this morning. Out of respect.

04:34.899 --> 04:38.277
Yeah. No. No, you're right.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.282
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.793
- Yes?
- Hi. I'm Ross Geller.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.712
I live in the building.

04:56.879 --> 05:01.008
And I'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.

05:02.135 --> 05:08.056
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and I am so sorry for your loss.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.475
- She didn't pass away.
- What?

05:10.643 --> 05:14.855
- My mother's still alive.
- Oh, thank God!

05:16.816 --> 05:19.234
It looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning...

05:19.402 --> 05:22.029
- ...but she's a tough old bird.
- Aww.

05:22.196 --> 05:23.822
Are you close with her?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.615
Of course. Heh.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.577
Uh, yeah.
She and I would talk all the time...

05:28.745 --> 05:32.080
...in the laundry room.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.915
You speak Dutch?

05:41.257 --> 05:44.051
You know, I would,
but it's just too painful.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.139
So she's really not dead.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.642
- No. She's hanging in there.
- Mm.

05:52.810 --> 05:57.647
Do you think...? Could you tell me, is she
hanging in in a one-bedroom or a two?

06:02.320 --> 06:06.406
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?

06:06.574 --> 06:09.868
Oh, well, um, I make it myself.

06:10.036 --> 06:14.706
It's two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. The secret ingredient is...

06:15.249 --> 06:17.417
You know what? We just met.

06:18.544 --> 06:22.672
Okay. Uh, I'm gonna get the clothes
from the laundry room now...

06:22.840 --> 06:25.550
...and when I come back,
I'll clean behind the fridge.

06:26.135 --> 06:27.386
I love her.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.181
I'll be back in a minute.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.600
Okay.

06:35.019 --> 06:38.313
- See? I told you.
- She stole my jeans!

06:40.858 --> 06:41.900
What?

06:42.985 --> 06:45.862
I have been looking for them all week
and she is wearing them.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.572
So she stole your pants...

06:47.740 --> 06:50.617
...and then she came back
and wore them in front of you?

06:50.785 --> 06:54.204
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.083
She must have been
planning this for years.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.501
I will prove it to you.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.670
About a week ago,
I was wearing those jeans.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.840
I dropped a pen in my lap
and it left an ink stain on the crotch.

07:05.007 --> 07:09.428
When she comes back,
I will find it and show you that stain!

07:11.889 --> 07:14.516
Is it possible the company
that sold the jeans...

07:14.684 --> 07:16.852
...made more than just the one pair?

07:18.187 --> 07:19.187
I guess.

07:19.355 --> 07:22.482
So shouldn't we give her
the benefit of the doubt before we go...

07:22.650 --> 07:24.609
...snooping around her crotch?

07:26.779 --> 07:30.282
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give
her my secret ingredient.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.909
Heh. Out of curiosity,
what is your secret ingredient?

07:33.077 --> 07:35.245
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

07:40.042 --> 07:43.420
- Hi.
- Come in. I'm so glad you're here.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.088
Yeah. Me too.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.799
Not in the shaky,
angry way you are, though.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.552
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.138
- I had to get the engagement ring back.
- Ugh.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.433
Just seeing her brought it all back.

07:56.601 --> 08:00.061
All the lies, the way she used me.

08:00.229 --> 08:04.691
I just... I get so angry,
just looking at her...

08:07.445 --> 08:12.157
- Face.
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:13.117 --> 08:17.871
I'm sorry. It's just, when I look at you...

08:18.039 --> 08:20.540
...I see her.

08:20.708 --> 08:25.754
And when I see her,
I get a little bit angry.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.717
- Maybe this is too weird.
- No, wait.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.928
There's only a problem...

08:33.221 --> 08:34.346
...when I look at you.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.225
I got it. I got it.

08:39.184 --> 08:41.977
No, don't tear out your eyes!

08:42.145 --> 08:46.441
- I was just gonna take out my lenses.
- Oh, yeah. Try that.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.112
So is that better?

08:51.531 --> 08:52.822
Not really.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.494
You... Ugh. You're blurry.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.664
But you still look like Ursula.
You're "Blursula."

09:02.875 --> 09:06.670
Okay, wait. Maybe...

09:08.172 --> 09:11.383
If I just don't look at you for a while.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.471
See? It works.
I'm not angry at all anymore.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.015
This is a great date!

09:20.434 --> 09:23.019
Look, Eric, turn around.

09:24.981 --> 09:29.442
Look, I like you, but it shouldn't
be this hard. It's our first date.

09:29.610 --> 09:33.572
First dates are supposed to be
about excitement and electricity.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.741
And "Ooh, he touched my hand,
did he mean touch my hand?"

09:36.909 --> 09:38.827
And, you know, first kisses, and...

09:40.997 --> 09:42.914
...second kisses.

09:46.168 --> 09:49.170
Thanks for the coffee, or, uh, ahem:

10:00.016 --> 10:01.391
Yeah, we're done.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.440
"Ezel"? Ezel...

10:09.191 --> 10:10.900
Hey, Ross. Listen.

10:11.068 --> 10:14.404
You wanna go see
that new IMAX movie on tide pools?

10:14.572 --> 10:17.032
- Really?
- No, ha, ha.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.453
But I got Knicks tickets
for you, me, and Chandler.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.497
- Sweet!
- All right, finish your coffee. Let's go.

10:24.665 --> 10:26.333
I have to stop by my place.

10:26.500 --> 10:31.004
To tape the game? You do this every
time. You're not gonna be on TV!

10:31.881 --> 10:35.050
No, no, I have to see
if this apartment became available.

10:35.217 --> 10:38.345
- You're switching apartments?
- Not for me, it's for Rachel.

10:38.512 --> 10:41.973
- Rachel has an apartment.
- When the baby comes, she's gonna move.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.142
- She is?
- Yeah.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.354
You didn't expect her
to live there with a baby, did you?

10:47.521 --> 10:49.898
I guess I didn't really think about it.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.069
Ezel.

10:55.613 --> 10:59.324
Hey, Gunther, you're an ezel. Huh.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.245
Damn it.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.252
- Nice jeans.
- Oh, thanks.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.423
- I like your top.
- Oh. You're not getting it.

11:22.932 --> 11:26.768
- What happened?
- Oh. I fell asleep.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.064
I was thinking about taking
my lunch break.

11:31.232 --> 11:35.276
Will you do the top of the cabinets?
That'll really work up your appetite.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.154
All right.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.971
Hello.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.807
What's going on?

12:05.975 --> 12:09.519
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid
before. Is this not okay?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.444
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:17.611 --> 12:21.823
- How was the game?
- Uh, it was okay. I ate way too much.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.408
- Mm.
- Ooh.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.248
So, um, I was talking to Ross and he said
you were looking for a new place?

12:30.416 --> 12:36.087
Oh, yeah. Hopefully across the street.
If certain Dutch people would just let go.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.632
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.

12:40.968 --> 12:44.345
But Joey, I have to go.
There's no room for a baby here.

12:44.513 --> 12:48.516
No room? It's a baby.
It's, like, this big.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.854
You could put it over here.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.858
Or we could put it right here.
Aw! Cute, right?

12:57.026 --> 13:00.612
Or over here.
You wouldn't even notice it.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.864
"Where's the baby?"
"Oh, it's right over..."

13:05.201 --> 13:08.578
Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.

13:08.746 --> 13:12.165
A baby changes everything.
They cry all the time.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.375
Imagine bringing home some girl...

13:14.543 --> 13:17.295
...and trying to score
when there's a screaming baby.

13:17.463 --> 13:21.049
I could use a challenge.
It's getting pretty easy.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.886
It's so sweet that you want me
to stay, but I can't do that to you.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.096
I mean, it would disrupt your entire life.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.225
It's just...

13:30.643 --> 13:33.812
I love living with you so much.

13:33.979 --> 13:38.316
- I wish things didn't have to change.
- I know.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.735
You know, I blame Ross for this.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.031
- I do too, a little bit.
- Yeah.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.951
I'm gonna miss you.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.745
You're the hottest roommate
I ever had.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.126
Mm. Ooh.

13:57.294 --> 14:01.172
Oh, no, I have to go.
Ugh, I have a massage appointment.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.592
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
I'll pay you.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.720
No, I've gotten in trouble
for that before.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.766
- I'll see you later?
- Absolutely.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.020
I love the way you kiss.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.815
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!

14:18.983 --> 14:20.859
Heh, you'll see.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.700
- Hey.
- Hey! Um...

14:28.868 --> 14:31.703
- I think Brenda needs a raise.
- How come?

14:31.871 --> 14:34.706
Because I put my head
between her legs.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.876
- To see her pants?
- They're my pants!

14:38.043 --> 14:39.961
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?

14:40.129 --> 14:43.131
No. I was getting into position,
and everything went dark.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.303
God, she is not stealing from us, okay?
Will you let this go?

14:48.470 --> 14:50.013
Fine.

14:55.519 --> 14:58.813
- She's wearing my bra!
- Oh, dear God.

14:59.523 --> 15:02.275
My pink flowered bra!
I recognize the strap!

15:02.443 --> 15:04.611
And yet you don't recognize
that you're crazy?

15:04.778 --> 15:06.404
Here's the plan, okay?

15:06.572 --> 15:09.574
I'm going to leave,
and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.619
Here's another plan. No.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.080
I would do it, but she thinks
I'm attracted to her.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.917
- Why?
- Did you not hear where my head was?

15:20.836 --> 15:23.546
Come on! We're a team.
We're in this together.

15:23.714 --> 15:27.175
I fear a jury will see it the same way.

15:28.719 --> 15:32.138
Do this for me. I catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.681
You see that?

15:34.516 --> 15:36.267
Do you see this? Unh...

15:38.687 --> 15:41.189
All right. Yes, okay. I get your point.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.275
But if it's not her bra,
will you just let the woman clean?

15:44.443 --> 15:46.110
Yes. Absolutely. Okay?

15:46.278 --> 15:49.280
You'll know it's mine because on
the right cup, the lacy part...

15:49.448 --> 15:51.532
...there's very a noticeable rip.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.743
You need new clothes.

15:59.291 --> 16:02.752
- Hi. How is she?
- It's not looking good.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.588
Oh? Oh. Aw.

16:06.715 --> 16:10.093
Well, I, uh, brought her some bloemen.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.429
That's so sweet.

16:13.597 --> 16:17.266
Would you like to say goodbye?
I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.812
Oh, I don't know that it would. Heh.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.857
- Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
- All right, then.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.035
- Hey!
- Welcome back.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.915
- Should we pick up from where we left off?
- I don't know.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.792
I'm still tired from this afternoon.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.253
- Why?
- Uh, the sex.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.338
- What sex?
- Our sex.

16:47.506 --> 16:48.881
We didn't have sex.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.758
Well if I didn't have sex with you...

16:50.926 --> 16:53.720
...I had sex with somebody
that looked an awful lot like...

16:55.889 --> 17:00.268
- Ew. Ew. Ew, ew!
- No, no, no, no!

17:00.436 --> 17:04.355
- You had sex with Ursula?
- A little bit.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.608
She walked in, I thought she was you
and I kissed her and...

17:07.776 --> 17:09.736
You didn't notice different clothes?

17:09.903 --> 17:13.489
- I was just so excited to see you.
- Aw.

17:13.656 --> 17:15.950
Ew! Ew! Ew!

17:16.201 --> 17:18.744
Ugh! You know what? This is too weird.

17:18.912 --> 17:21.998
No. I don't wanna lose you.
It's like I was saying to Ursula...

17:22.165 --> 17:24.876
...when I was making love to her
and thought she was you...

17:25.044 --> 17:26.919
Yeah. It's too weird.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.256
So I guess this is it.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.051
Yeah.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.763
Maybe it's for the best.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.475
- You smell just like her.
- Yeah, so do you.

17:59.953 --> 18:03.706
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaning.

18:04.374 --> 18:06.667
This is where I lean.

18:07.961 --> 18:09.670
Okay.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.300
- Brenda, a bee!
- What?

18:14.468 --> 18:16.219
Yes, it's flown into your blouse.

18:16.386 --> 18:19.639
You better undo your buttons
lest it sting you.

18:21.517 --> 18:25.311
- I think I know what's going on here.
- You do?

18:25.479 --> 18:28.940
Look, I know it must be hard
that your wife is a lesbian...

18:31.777 --> 18:34.695
...but it's wrong. You're married.

18:34.863 --> 18:38.116
- I totally understand.
- Okay, good. Ha-ha-ha.

18:38.283 --> 18:41.035
Could I just see your bra?

18:44.581 --> 18:45.873
Hi.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.920
- Where'd you get those jeans?
- You gave them to me.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.423
- No, I didn't!
- All right, I took them.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.803
I figured it was okay,
you've got an ink stain on the crotch.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.849
- Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
- What bra?

19:03.016 --> 19:06.477
- The pink one with the flowers.
- You mean the one you're wearing?

19:11.233 --> 19:13.234
I quit!

19:14.319 --> 19:16.320
Sounds about right.

19:23.328 --> 19:25.079
- What is this?
- Hey.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.248
Uh, this is just to give you an idea.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.877
We can put screens here
so the baby has privacy...

19:31.044 --> 19:34.255
...and maybe a mobile,
you know, over the crib...

19:34.423 --> 19:37.592
...and, uh, here's a baby monitor which,
until the baby comes...

19:37.759 --> 19:41.012
...we can use as walkie-talkies. Eh?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.389
You're so sweet!

19:44.683 --> 19:48.019
Oh, my God!
And you gave the baby Hugsy!

19:50.063 --> 19:51.898
Uh...

19:54.902 --> 19:58.112
That's really just to show
where the baby would go.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.948
Why don't I hold on to him
so there's no confusion?

20:05.537 --> 20:09.457
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.
It's gonna be loud.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.210
- I'm loud.
- It's gonna be up all night.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.712
- I'm up all night.
- It's gonna poop.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.923
Hello?

20:18.508 --> 20:20.384
What about the women
you wanna bring home?

20:20.552 --> 20:24.263
Look, if I'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand being around a baby...

20:24.431 --> 20:26.974
...then maybe I don't wanna
be with that woman.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.187
Or maybe we'll do it
in the bathroom of the club!

20:32.648 --> 20:34.815
- Joey, are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:34.983 --> 20:38.986
Look, I know sometimes
it'll be hard, okay...

20:39.905 --> 20:43.616
...but it'll also be really,
really great.

20:43.784 --> 20:46.577
Please, Rachel,
I really want you to stay.

20:49.414 --> 20:52.416
- I want me to stay too. Thank you.
- Aw.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.464
Joey, look at this crib! It's so cute!

20:58.632 --> 21:00.675
I know. I found it on the street.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.343
Are you...? Really?

21:02.511 --> 21:04.887
- This is in such good condition.
- Yeah.

21:05.055 --> 21:07.473
Wow. Whoa, what's under the cover?

21:07.641 --> 21:09.141
- I don't know.
- It's moving.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.685
- Ew.
- Still...

21:10.852 --> 21:13.187
- Aah! It's got a tail! Get it out!
- Oh, aah! Okay!

21:21.905 --> 21:25.950
Well, the old lady died.
And how do I know?

21:26.118 --> 21:29.495
Because her dying wish
was for one last kiss.

21:31.832 --> 21:35.751
But I don't care because
you got the apartment. Yes!

21:35.919 --> 21:38.587
Ew, yeah.

21:38.755 --> 21:41.966
Um, I think I'm gonna stay here.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.260
Isn't that great?

21:47.389 --> 21:48.973
Ezels!
