WEBVTT

00:03.306 --> 00:05.455
So... how about that truck?

00:05.456 --> 00:07.424
Isn't she a beauty? Just like you.

00:07.524 --> 00:09.291
It has my name on it.

00:09.418 --> 00:10.618
Bro.

00:10.916 --> 00:12.903
Bro, bro, bro...

00:13.970 --> 00:15.170
I'm a little confused.

00:15.171 --> 00:16.619
You were on your way to a very expensive

00:16.620 --> 00:18.719
cooking school that I
wrote a very big check for.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.388
And now you stand before me...

00:20.648 --> 00:21.978
with a food truck.

00:21.979 --> 00:23.469
That has my name on it.

00:24.930 --> 00:26.664
I totally get your confusion, man.

00:26.665 --> 00:28.479
I was in a cab going to the airport.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.234
And I was thinking about
Gabi when all of a sudden,

00:30.235 --> 00:31.501
I see this food truck for sale.

00:31.502 --> 00:32.702
I was like, "stop."

00:32.703 --> 00:34.674
I told the cabbie, "You pull over, cabbie!"

00:34.698 --> 00:35.898
And then I bought it.

00:36.174 --> 00:38.745
- With the $36,000 I gave you?
- Shwah!

00:39.320 --> 00:40.620
That's not how you shwah.

00:41.548 --> 00:43.197
That is not how you shwah!

00:44.953 --> 00:47.179
Look, Gabi's an amazing
cook, so why shouldn't I learn

00:47.180 --> 00:48.387
and make money at the same time?

00:48.388 --> 00:49.759
Oh come on, Jake!

00:49.919 --> 00:51.452
You change jobs every two weeks.

00:51.486 --> 00:52.787
What makes you think Gabi's just gonna

00:52.821 --> 00:55.156
jump on the crazy train and
start a food truck with you?

00:55.190 --> 00:56.526
She just said she loved it.

00:56.527 --> 00:58.592
Well, she was being polite.

00:59.135 --> 01:00.335
Tell him how you feel, Gabi.

01:00.336 --> 01:04.816
This is the nicest thing that
anybody's ever done for me.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.633
And it has my name on it.

Shalom.

01:32.259 --> 01:35.012
Alan and I are meeting
with Rabbi Shapiro today.

01:35.013 --> 01:38.807
Um... what's yiddish for "Who cares?"

01:40.499 --> 01:43.670
According to Alan's mother,
we need him to give us

01:43.671 --> 01:45.625
his blessing before he marries us.

01:45.842 --> 01:49.564
No couple he's married has ever divorced.

01:49.565 --> 01:51.843
Oh, that's too bad...

01:52.276 --> 01:54.780
'Cause divorced men are my specialty.

01:56.554 --> 01:58.959
Oh, you still can't find
a date to my wedding?

02:00.051 --> 02:02.935
Oy. That's yiddish for "What a shocker."

02:05.984 --> 02:07.281
Good morning.

02:07.282 --> 02:10.394
Hey! Is that Gabi from
Gabi and Jake's food truck?

02:10.428 --> 02:12.725
Yeah, it is.

02:12.726 --> 02:14.825
I thought you'd be busy
driving around town with Jake,

02:14.826 --> 02:16.026
my brother.

02:16.757 --> 02:19.872
No, I'm here cooking
breakfast for you, my boss,

02:19.873 --> 02:21.508
'cause that's my job.

02:22.457 --> 02:23.657
Oh.

02:23.658 --> 02:25.274
You think you can do both jobs?

02:25.309 --> 02:27.774
Yeah, I'm gonna work here
for you during the day,

02:27.775 --> 02:29.112
and I'm gonna take the truck out at night.

02:29.146 --> 02:31.146
That's cool with you, right?

02:31.702 --> 02:33.715
Yes, Gabi. That's totally cool.

02:35.418 --> 02:36.618
Why is that funny?

02:36.801 --> 02:38.001
Why is that funny?

02:39.240 --> 02:40.440
No reason.

02:40.441 --> 02:41.930
I am completely positive and confident

02:41.931 --> 02:43.947
this will be a wise and lucrative decision.

02:45.213 --> 02:47.129
Really? Because, ah, you know,

02:47.130 --> 02:49.613
your tone is kind of suggesting otherwise.

02:49.845 --> 02:51.941
Well, I suppose my tone
might be pondering the notion

02:51.942 --> 02:53.667
of, ah, how much thought you put into this,

02:53.668 --> 02:55.025
you know, since last night.

02:56.571 --> 02:58.687
More specifically what's
your culinary target market,

02:58.688 --> 03:00.156
is there a certain
niche being under-served,

03:00.157 --> 03:01.557
and what's your marketing strategy?

03:03.478 --> 03:06.272
Yeah, like we haven't thought
through all that already.

03:07.648 --> 03:08.874
Okay, we haven't.

03:09.816 --> 03:12.152
But you want to know
why? Because unlike you,

03:12.186 --> 03:14.087
me and Jake don't think...

03:17.510 --> 03:18.888
We do.

03:20.361 --> 03:22.491
- If you say so.
- I do, okay?

03:22.492 --> 03:24.998
This is gonna be a huge
success. Do you want to know why?

03:24.999 --> 03:28.159
Because we have a food
truck with our name on it!

03:29.286 --> 03:31.679
What do you have with your name on it?

03:31.680 --> 03:33.748
A corporate office building,
numerous magazine covers,

03:33.749 --> 03:35.128
the check I write you every week.

03:42.381 --> 03:44.603
This truck is gonna make so much money!

03:44.604 --> 03:46.247
And I'm gonna open a bank account,

03:46.248 --> 03:48.404
and Josh is gonna be like, "What?"

03:48.954 --> 03:52.103
Yeah, well I'm already like, "Why?"

03:52.989 --> 03:55.925
Gabi, have you thought any of this through?

03:55.926 --> 03:59.510
Well, after Josh made
me think I didn't, I did.

03:59.589 --> 04:01.690
I'm gonna use the money I
make catering the wedding

04:01.725 --> 04:04.503
to buy the ingredients to make
the food I sell in the food truck.

04:04.504 --> 04:06.964
Damn it! Why didn't I think
of that when Josh asked me?

04:07.264 --> 04:09.744
Okay. I just think it's a little bit naive.

04:09.745 --> 04:11.987
I really don't understand
why you'd risk everything

04:11.988 --> 04:14.737
over a guy... hi.

04:15.804 --> 04:17.906
- I'm Sofia.
- I'm Jake.

04:18.930 --> 04:20.130
Wow.

04:20.132 --> 04:21.543
Wow, wow, wow.

04:21.543 --> 04:23.444
Do you have any brothers?

04:23.445 --> 04:25.795
- Yes... Josh.
- Oh, right.

04:26.755 --> 04:27.955
Ah, It's nice to meet you.

04:27.956 --> 04:30.674
I am going to check on the intake manifold.

04:31.352 --> 04:32.923
I just said that to impress you.

04:32.924 --> 04:34.124
It worked.

04:35.977 --> 04:37.844
I'd like to intake his manifold.

04:40.482 --> 04:41.878
Well, well, well...

04:41.879 --> 04:44.355
Gabi in a short skirt in a dirty alleyway.

04:44.356 --> 04:45.823
Some things just make sense.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.404
- Gabala, hey.
- Hey.

04:49.410 --> 04:51.035
So, my mom called.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.183
It turns out a lot of our
guests eat strictly kosher,

04:54.184 --> 04:56.035
so the appetizers have to be, too.

04:56.444 --> 04:58.857
Oh, okay. Well, I'll just make them kosher.

04:58.858 --> 05:00.125
What do I gotta do to them?

05:00.126 --> 05:02.011
Make them all again in a whole new kitchen.

05:02.519 --> 05:05.467
Kosher food has to be
prepared in a kosher facility.

05:05.468 --> 05:08.644
Ah well, hey, maybe the kitchen in
this food truck is a kosher facility.

05:08.645 --> 05:11.280
It's in the shape of a pig,
sweetheart, so, I'm guessing no.

05:11.547 --> 05:12.747
I'm sorry, Gabi.

05:13.794 --> 05:16.173
If it helps... I never wanted you to be

05:16.174 --> 05:17.566
a part of this in the first place.

05:20.430 --> 05:22.295
Well, there went my dreams.

05:22.751 --> 05:25.147
Oh, God, Gabi. I am so sorry.

05:25.943 --> 05:27.567
Jake, I just got fired from the wedding,

05:27.568 --> 05:29.011
and now all I have is no money

05:29.012 --> 05:31.509
and a thousand non-kosher appetizers.

05:31.717 --> 05:33.018
That's sweet! Wa...

05:33.019 --> 05:35.386
You have food... we have a food truck!

05:35.387 --> 05:37.322
Let's take this baby for a spin tonight.

05:37.323 --> 05:38.891
Oh, my God. That's an amazing idea!

05:38.892 --> 05:41.165
- You're an amazing idea.
- Oh, okay.

05:46.286 --> 05:49.468
Remember how amazing you
were when you said we could

05:49.469 --> 05:51.653
sell my appetizers to
a whole bunch of people,

05:51.654 --> 05:54.487
and then you took me to a
park where there are no people?

05:54.827 --> 05:57.191
- Is somebody a little nervous?
- Uh-huh.

05:57.192 --> 05:58.653
Gabi, it's all good.

05:58.654 --> 06:00.321
My buddy Ed from my tuna boat days

06:00.322 --> 06:01.855
is playing a small gig near here,

06:01.856 --> 06:04.444
and I'm sure people are gonna
be hungry after his show.

06:04.445 --> 06:05.845
A small gig?

06:05.846 --> 06:07.718
We have a thousand appetizers to sell.

06:07.719 --> 06:10.317
I mean, what if Josh is right?
What if our business fails

06:10.318 --> 06:12.190
and we're no longer business partners,

06:12.191 --> 06:14.592
and then we're no longer
any type of partners,

06:14.593 --> 06:16.628
and... and then we... We're not a...

06:19.376 --> 06:21.977
I am really into you.

06:23.162 --> 06:24.429
- You are?
- Oh!

06:24.430 --> 06:26.376
And another thing...

06:28.069 --> 06:29.336
Oh, my God.

06:29.544 --> 06:32.646
Um... who is Ed from the tuna boat?

06:32.647 --> 06:34.292
Oh, his last name is Sheeran.

06:34.998 --> 06:36.203
Ed Sheeran?

06:36.204 --> 06:38.767
The grammy nominee who's best
friends with Taylor Swift?

06:38.768 --> 06:40.772
What? I thought I was his best friend.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.206
Hi, Joel, this is Yolanda
from church choir...

06:47.292 --> 06:50.694
I have an issue, I have this
little event on Saturday,

06:50.695 --> 06:52.129
and I was just wondering...

06:52.130 --> 06:53.701
oh, your wife came out of that coma?

06:56.132 --> 06:57.633
Congrats.

06:59.216 --> 07:01.349
Permanent vegetative state, my ass.

07:02.604 --> 07:04.204
Isn't this cute?

07:04.205 --> 07:06.617
Gabi and Jake started a Twitter
account for their food truck.

07:06.890 --> 07:10.259
They just tweeted a photo of
Gabi, Jake, and Ed Sheeran.

07:11.861 --> 07:14.180
"We are killing it, hashtag blessed,

07:14.181 --> 07:15.616
"hashtag almost sold out."

07:15.617 --> 07:16.888
Well, guess what, Yolanda?

07:16.889 --> 07:17.897
- Mm-hm.
- "Almost sold out"

07:17.898 --> 07:20.404
is a lot different
than... "hashtag sold out."

07:22.223 --> 07:23.624
Thank you.

07:24.408 --> 07:25.742
We did it!

07:26.208 --> 07:28.908
Hey, officer, we just
sold out of everything.

07:28.909 --> 07:31.616
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too. So, what did I miss?

07:31.617 --> 07:33.987
Oh, my God. Ah, lobster pot pies,

07:33.988 --> 07:37.251
Korean short rib waffle cones,
bacon mac and cheese pops,

07:37.252 --> 07:38.972
you name it, we had it.

07:39.653 --> 07:41.342
Did you happen to have a permit?

07:42.313 --> 07:44.147
For what now?

07:44.826 --> 07:46.833
Business permit, health permit,

07:46.834 --> 07:48.862
- commercial driver's license...
- Hold on! Ah...

07:48.863 --> 07:50.088
one second.

07:50.089 --> 07:51.355
- Jake?
- No.

07:51.356 --> 07:52.656
- No to...
- All of those.

07:52.657 --> 07:55.668
Okay, um... Officer,
we may have a little...

07:55.669 --> 07:57.870
Ma'am, hand over the keys.

07:57.871 --> 08:00.442
- We're towing your truck.
- What? No! Jake, do something.

08:00.604 --> 08:02.364
Um... maybe we should call Josh.

08:02.365 --> 08:04.433
Here you go, officer.
Guess we're shut down.

08:04.562 --> 08:06.363
- We should call...
- We're shut down!

08:09.124 --> 08:11.065
Elliot, this is the worst day ever.

08:11.066 --> 08:13.235
If I give you a check
for a thousand dollars,

08:13.236 --> 08:14.549
can I not hear why?

08:16.176 --> 08:17.476
Yeah, I wish.

08:17.673 --> 08:20.275
Alan is insisting we pay you for
the work you did on the wedding.

08:20.309 --> 08:22.439
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.550
I can surprise Jake with the truck!

08:24.551 --> 08:27.801
- I love you, I love you, I love you...
- I have this, I hate this, I hate this...

08:30.855 --> 08:32.799
And that's why I'm convinced

08:32.801 --> 08:35.260
that Stevie Wonder can see!

08:36.991 --> 08:38.780
Anyway, Rabbi Shapiro...

08:38.907 --> 08:40.996
to get your blessing
would be a real mitzvah.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.565
So, tell me more about your relationship.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.784
I think that we're fated to be together.

08:45.785 --> 08:48.220
He's my Woody Allen, and I'm his Soon Yi.

08:53.006 --> 08:56.242
We laugh, we kid...

08:56.243 --> 08:57.443
We stop.

08:59.055 --> 09:03.463
So, ah, what are the areas of
conflict in your relationship?

09:03.464 --> 09:05.766
- Conflict? As if.
- Us?

09:05.939 --> 09:09.008
The only thing we argue about
is who loves the other more.

09:09.009 --> 09:11.441
We even finish each other's...

09:14.084 --> 09:16.519
We finish each other's...

09:16.520 --> 09:20.590
So as you can see, Rabbi, we are a delight.

09:20.818 --> 09:22.018
Do we have your blessing?

09:22.019 --> 09:25.722
I think that we are going
to have to meet again,

09:25.723 --> 09:27.156
and then we'll see.

09:27.157 --> 09:29.191
- So it's a maybe?
- Well...

09:29.736 --> 09:31.441
It's a we'll see.

09:35.124 --> 09:36.779
Sentences!

09:37.374 --> 09:40.546
We finish each other's sentences!

09:46.817 --> 09:49.445
- Hey, Josh, have you seen Gabi?
- Why? Did you guys have a fight?

09:49.446 --> 09:51.167
Did something go horribly
wrong? I hope not.

09:52.747 --> 09:54.342
Actually, something did.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.111
Gabi didn't want me to say
anything, but I hate to keep secrets.

09:57.145 --> 10:00.294
The truck got impounded last night,
'cause I didn't know we had to get permits.

10:01.106 --> 10:02.573
So, it wasn't a huge success?

10:03.250 --> 10:05.376
No, dude. It was a fiasco.

10:05.377 --> 10:06.587
It was!

10:07.173 --> 10:10.977
It was... and I feel horrible.

10:11.238 --> 10:13.833
You don't look like
you do. What's the deal?

10:13.834 --> 10:15.988
Are you still mad 'cause I
spent the money on the truck?

10:15.989 --> 10:17.089
No. It's not about the truck.

10:17.090 --> 10:18.925
- I don't care about the truck.
- So then it's...

10:18.926 --> 10:21.061
Gabi? No. It's not about Gabi.

10:21.155 --> 10:22.465
Oh, my God.

10:22.842 --> 10:24.909
I can't believe I never thought about this.

10:24.910 --> 10:26.743
- Are you into her?
- What?

10:26.869 --> 10:28.069
Me?

10:28.070 --> 10:29.990
Where would you come up
with something like that?

10:30.202 --> 10:32.869
Well, you just blurted
out her name for no reason,

10:32.870 --> 10:34.802
which would explain the
way you've been acting.

10:34.803 --> 10:37.705
What? That is ridic... what?

10:38.294 --> 10:40.244
This is totally making sense.

10:40.245 --> 10:42.219
That's why you wanted to
send me across the country

10:42.220 --> 10:44.100
to cooking school... you
wanted to get rid of me

10:44.145 --> 10:45.411
because you like her.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.258
Jake, that's...

10:47.793 --> 10:50.260
Fine. You don't have the
balls to admit it? I do.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.240
I like her.

10:52.241 --> 10:53.675
Josh, I really like her.

10:53.792 --> 10:54.992
Fine.

10:54.993 --> 10:56.460
You want balls?

10:57.044 --> 10:58.323
I like her, too.

11:01.182 --> 11:03.518
Jake! Guess who got the keys to the f...

11:03.519 --> 11:05.152
city?

11:07.249 --> 11:12.954
Because the mayor, Ed
Lee, loves our food truck!

11:14.402 --> 11:16.269
I ah, I... I'm out of here.

11:16.578 --> 11:17.960
Uh-huh...

11:18.021 --> 11:19.955
Jake, what's going on?

11:19.961 --> 11:22.792
I'm sorry, Gabi. I...
I just need some space.

11:28.206 --> 11:29.620
Josh, what's going on?

11:29.681 --> 11:31.080
Okay, Jake's not talking to me.

11:31.114 --> 11:32.749
Well, Josh isn't talking to you, either.

11:33.076 --> 11:35.552
Well, what if Gabi asked nicely?

11:36.467 --> 11:38.442
It's just a little issue
between me and my brother

11:38.443 --> 11:39.810
that happened to flare up.

11:40.823 --> 11:42.906
Okay, I don't mean this in
an egotistical way at all,

11:42.907 --> 11:45.108
but could it possibly be about Gabi?

11:45.704 --> 11:46.904
Maybe.

11:48.003 --> 11:49.892
Look, he accused me of being into you.

11:51.548 --> 11:53.782
Well, did you tell him that you're not?

11:53.816 --> 11:55.126
I told him...

11:57.130 --> 11:59.131
I told him...

12:03.636 --> 12:05.744
Gabi, how can you date my brother

12:05.877 --> 12:08.045
when three months ago
I told you I loved you?

12:08.962 --> 12:10.243
What, Josh?

12:10.244 --> 12:11.976
We talked about this, okay?

12:11.977 --> 12:13.532
You said you wanted to be friends.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.541
Yes, Gabi. And friends
don't go dating their ex...

12:16.910 --> 12:19.687
a-a-almost something's brother.

12:21.423 --> 12:24.843
But shouldn't friends be happy
when their friend is happy?

12:26.027 --> 12:27.654
Then I guess we're not friends.

12:29.938 --> 12:31.438
Well, I guess we're not.

12:33.902 --> 12:35.808
I don't even want this truck anymore.

12:40.201 --> 12:41.902
My house keys are on there.

12:47.785 --> 12:49.280
Thanks for coming back, Rabbi.

12:49.281 --> 12:51.409
After all, the wedding is tomorrow.

12:51.786 --> 12:53.016
Is it?

12:53.243 --> 12:54.958
Not for nothing, but God willing,

12:54.959 --> 12:57.541
when I go to heaven,
it'll pale in comparison

12:57.542 --> 13:01.439
to the eternal bliss I feel
every moment I spend with Elliot.

13:02.650 --> 13:04.021
Aw...

13:04.642 --> 13:07.079
That's it. I have seen enough.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.507
So, do we get your blessing?

13:08.508 --> 13:09.742
I don't think so.

13:09.743 --> 13:10.943
What?

13:10.944 --> 13:13.607
Oh, God. My mother will
never let us get married now.

13:13.762 --> 13:15.076
Let us?

13:15.077 --> 13:17.445
Cut the damn umbilical cord already!

13:17.446 --> 13:18.646
You're 90.

13:18.824 --> 13:21.059
It's not about my mother.
It's about tradition.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.112
You'd know that if you'd ever
watch Fiddler with me.

13:23.750 --> 13:26.348
Who needs to watch it when
you're always quoting it?

13:27.308 --> 13:29.157
That is enough.

13:29.261 --> 13:31.483
Rabbi Shapiro, I'm so
sorry you had to see this.

13:31.484 --> 13:34.922
No, you shouldn't be. Finally,
I get to see you as a couple!

13:34.923 --> 13:37.729
Couples fight. Couples have arguments.

13:37.730 --> 13:39.237
That's healthy and normal.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.417
Well, then we're the most healthy,
normal couple you'll ever meet.

13:43.140 --> 13:45.285
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

13:46.955 --> 13:49.222
There you go. You have my blessing.

13:49.223 --> 13:50.457
- We do?
- Yes.

13:50.491 --> 13:51.924
Yay!

13:53.127 --> 13:54.995
Oh! Let's go call my mother.

13:54.996 --> 13:57.284
- And pray we get voicemail.
- How dare you!

13:58.296 --> 14:00.305
Hey, Rabbi Shapiro.

14:00.434 --> 14:01.913
Joshua, thank you so much

14:01.914 --> 14:03.874
for inviting me into your lovely home.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.231
I gave the happy couple my blessing.

14:06.335 --> 14:08.202
- My work here is done.
- That's nice.

14:08.203 --> 14:09.770
Hey, ah, do you want a splash of this?

14:09.771 --> 14:12.783
Oh, no, thank you. I only
drink on high holidays

14:12.784 --> 14:14.515
and just before a circumcision.

14:15.761 --> 14:17.418
Is there something on your mind?

14:17.535 --> 14:19.135
A lot, actually.

14:19.352 --> 14:21.219
Well, I'm sure you'll work it out.

14:21.253 --> 14:24.352
I can really use someone to talk to.

14:24.621 --> 14:26.605
All right. Start pouring.

14:27.496 --> 14:29.038
My younger brother's in town,

14:29.202 --> 14:31.024
and normally, we get along great.

14:31.025 --> 14:32.286
Can you make this quick?

14:32.287 --> 14:35.432
I have a JDate with an Asian
who's willing to convert.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.160
Well...

14:39.566 --> 14:41.298
I did something bad because I was jealous

14:41.299 --> 14:42.982
about this new relationship
that he's getting into

14:42.983 --> 14:44.818
with somebody I used to have feelings for.

14:44.819 --> 14:47.433
Used to or still do?

14:48.296 --> 14:49.496
I don't know.

14:49.645 --> 14:51.179
Both maybe?

14:51.383 --> 14:55.115
Joshua, you are swimming
in dangerous waters.

14:55.116 --> 14:57.719
Have you ever heard the
story of Cain and Abel?

14:59.932 --> 15:01.132
Kinda.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.936
Spoiler alert, it does not end well.

15:04.943 --> 15:06.977
The point is, you're the older brother.

15:06.978 --> 15:08.579
You have to set an example.

15:08.580 --> 15:11.648
Do right by him, lest the relationship end

15:11.649 --> 15:13.982
in anger and bloodshed.

15:17.186 --> 15:19.264
- Is that also in the Bible?
- No.

15:19.265 --> 15:21.171
- Godfather: Part II.
- Mm.

15:24.631 --> 15:26.178
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:26.275 --> 15:29.666
for the first time as
husband and husband...

15:29.700 --> 15:33.136
Mr. and Mr. Park-Lowenstein!

15:38.583 --> 15:40.617
I take it you haven't
heard anything from Jake.

15:40.618 --> 15:41.818
No.

15:42.038 --> 15:44.239
He wouldn't answer my calls.
I don't know where he is.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.818
Hmm... maybe Josh knows.

15:45.948 --> 15:48.226
I wouldn't know. I'm not
talking to him, either.

15:53.323 --> 15:55.667
Aw, look. Everybody's dancing.

15:55.668 --> 15:57.303
Well, yipee skippy for them.

15:59.134 --> 16:00.334
Yolanda...

16:00.813 --> 16:02.625
May I have this dance?

16:02.626 --> 16:04.277
Oh, all right.

16:04.299 --> 16:06.000
But you're not getting past second base.

16:10.885 --> 16:13.308
For the last time, I was invited!

16:14.224 --> 16:15.424
Jake!

16:17.591 --> 16:19.998
I am sorry I didn't return your calls.

16:19.999 --> 16:21.759
I've been very confused about everything.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.960
So have I.

16:23.063 --> 16:24.497
Dance and talk?

16:24.531 --> 16:25.931
Let's do it.

16:34.773 --> 16:37.177
Joshua, sometimes we have to be steady

16:37.289 --> 16:40.435
and give up the things we
want most, even our dreams.

16:41.576 --> 16:43.539
- Bible?
- Spider-man.

16:45.136 --> 16:47.303
You know Gabi, I don't want to be the guy

16:47.304 --> 16:48.871
to come between you and Josh.

16:49.222 --> 16:51.913
Well, I don't want to be the girl
that comes between you and Josh.

16:52.155 --> 16:53.522
So what do we do?

16:58.025 --> 17:01.676
Excuse me, I'd like to propose a toast.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.393
Elliot's been my best
friend for many years,

17:07.922 --> 17:10.424
and I've never seen him
happier than he is today.

17:10.940 --> 17:13.065
And that's not just 'cause
I'm paying for the wedding.

17:13.066 --> 17:16.367
- And the honeymoon!
- Ha ha, we never discussed that part.

17:18.896 --> 17:21.339
You guys have found something amazing.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.405
And best part about this is
that it's just the beginning.

17:27.866 --> 17:29.822
And there's magic in beginnings.

17:31.121 --> 17:32.912
They're full of surprises,

17:33.685 --> 17:35.720
and you never know what's gonna happen.

17:37.130 --> 17:38.784
So, raise your glasses.

17:40.215 --> 17:44.009
Guys, here's to a lifetime of beginnings.

17:48.717 --> 17:53.114
So, about beginnings and surprises...

17:53.387 --> 17:55.088
I have one for my brother...

17:56.699 --> 17:57.999
And my friend.

18:02.292 --> 18:04.059
Oh, my God. Is that our truck?

18:04.060 --> 18:06.315
Yeah. It's got top
of the line new appliances,

18:06.316 --> 18:08.724
a new engine, an A.C. unit... the works.

18:08.725 --> 18:10.359
It looks amazing.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.028
And it's got your name on it.

18:13.029 --> 18:15.457
I figured if Ed Sheeran is tweeting
about how awesome your truck is,

18:15.458 --> 18:17.585
you should capitalize on that
and drive it down to Coachella.

18:17.586 --> 18:21.060
Coachella? That's like, the biggest
music festival in California.

18:21.061 --> 18:22.828
There is no way we can
get a permit for that.

18:22.829 --> 18:24.764
Oh, right.

18:25.018 --> 18:26.886
That is unless I already got you one.

18:26.887 --> 18:28.221
- Shwah!
- Shwah?

18:28.222 --> 18:29.422
Yeah!

18:29.926 --> 18:32.384
And if you leave now, you guys
can get there before it starts.

18:32.385 --> 18:34.686
Gabi, you have two weeks off.

18:35.083 --> 18:36.483
Go follow your dream.

18:37.005 --> 18:39.046
I... I can't believe you did this.

18:39.247 --> 18:40.754
Are you sure about this?

18:41.141 --> 18:42.341
I'm sure.

18:43.004 --> 18:44.557
I don't know how to thank you.

18:44.581 --> 18:45.781
Yeah, you do.

18:46.967 --> 18:48.693
You take good care of her.

18:56.404 --> 18:58.038
- Josh, I...
- Gabi...

18:58.998 --> 19:01.283
All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.

19:32.915 --> 19:35.438
Okay everyone, it's
time to toss the bouquet!

19:36.185 --> 19:38.675
Line up, you single losers!

19:39.147 --> 19:40.598
- Ooh, we got the best spot.
- Right?

19:40.599 --> 19:42.434
There's no way we don't catch this!

19:42.435 --> 19:43.635
Boom!

19:50.800 --> 19:52.167
Hey, I got it!

19:53.302 --> 19:55.103
I'm okay! I'm okay!

19:58.107 --> 20:00.408
- Hi.
- Ruben?

20:02.845 --> 20:05.094
You look so handsome
without your sandwich suit.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.754
Did you crash this wedding as big romantic

20:08.755 --> 20:10.260
gesture to get me back?

20:10.418 --> 20:11.985
I'm a waiter.

20:12.020 --> 20:13.366
And an idiot.

20:13.688 --> 20:15.388
I can't believe I broke up with you.

20:15.489 --> 20:17.324
You're the prettiest girl here.

20:18.993 --> 20:20.451
Go on...

20:20.452 --> 20:22.987
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Well, it's an open bar.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.638
So you know, you can buy me several.

20:26.716 --> 20:30.413
So, I guess that means you're single.

20:30.975 --> 20:32.190
I am.

20:32.696 --> 20:33.959
Thank you, Jesus!

20:34.560 --> 20:36.160
- No offense.
- No, ah...

20:36.576 --> 20:40.212
You don't by any chance
have any Jewish in you?

20:40.627 --> 20:41.840
I do not...

20:42.181 --> 20:43.648
But, the evening is young.

20:45.184 --> 20:46.384
Hey!
