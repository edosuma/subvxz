M_I_SForEver

03:38.515 --> 03:40.018
There he is.

03:40.050 --> 03:44.756
My own personal Michael Bublé.

03:47.391 --> 03:49.260
The Oasis looks beautiful.

03:49.294 --> 03:51.230
Not as beautiful as you.

03:57.033 --> 04:00.704
You know, I was thinking
about you...

04:00.737 --> 04:04.675
In the dusty van.

04:07.312 --> 04:13.485
Then, when I woke up and brushed
my teeth with my fingernail...

04:13.518 --> 04:14.686
I can't believe I kissed
that mouth.

04:14.718 --> 04:19.290
Well, I was thinking about you,
still.

04:19.324 --> 04:21.692
And now, here we are
in our oasis.

04:21.725 --> 04:23.528
My happy place.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.298
Face to face with the woman

04:26.331 --> 04:31.802
who I've been thinking about
ever since I left.

04:31.836 --> 04:34.004
Ah, Mishu...

04:34.038 --> 04:36.040
You're my stud and my Casanova.

04:36.074 --> 04:36.841
Hmm.

04:36.874 --> 04:38.076
Mmhmm.

04:41.879 --> 04:44.349
Hmm, you?

04:44.382 --> 04:46.483
Me? I've been worried sick
about you.

04:46.516 --> 04:48.819
Mm.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.754
Just another day
on planet earth.

04:50.788 --> 04:52.891
Yeah, it's just another day
on planet earth.

04:52.923 --> 04:54.125
I know.

04:54.158 --> 04:58.762
But I haven't been able to tear
myself away from this thing.

04:58.795 --> 04:59.930
And it was scary too.

04:59.963 --> 05:02.701
I almost peed my underpants
when I was....

05:02.733 --> 05:03.401
Well...

05:03.435 --> 05:04.802
No, not because
of the wine.

05:04.836 --> 05:06.603
Well, maybe partly
because of the wine.

05:06.637 --> 05:08.006
What glass is that?

05:08.038 --> 05:10.709
Well, it's four, but you zip it.
I deserve this.

05:10.742 --> 05:12.744
Now, now, the first movement
towards recovery

05:12.776 --> 05:14.545
is admitting we have a problem.

05:14.579 --> 05:16.014
I'll show you "problem."

05:27.692 --> 05:29.026
I think it's getting better.

05:29.927 --> 05:31.663
Terry doesn't seem to be
concerned at all

05:31.696 --> 05:33.631
about how big the fire
got last night.

05:33.663 --> 05:35.065
Oh, thank god.

05:35.098 --> 05:36.100
Hey, I got an exclusive.

05:37.999 --> 05:37.835
You did?

05:37.869 --> 05:38.636
About the highway?

05:38.668 --> 05:39.436
Yeah.

05:39.470 --> 05:42.107
Well, I mean, I had
the exclusive,

05:42.139 --> 05:46.443
until CTPR sourced the shadow
van that I guess sourced me.

05:46.476 --> 05:47.846
Come on.

06:00.958 --> 06:02.594
Oh, god.

06:04.595 --> 06:05.697
My last one.

06:05.730 --> 06:06.831
Oh, me too.

06:18.576 --> 06:21.746
<i>Oh god.</i>

06:21.778 --> 06:23.447
Dan, stop.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.214
No.

06:25.483 --> 06:26.918
Oh, come on!

06:27.884 --> 06:28.685
Oh god.

Ugh, I can't...

07:43.927 --> 07:46.930
Setting up the perimeter
both north and southbound.

07:46.963 --> 07:47.999
No more vehicles
getting through,

07:48.031 --> 07:49.000
it's too hairy.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.701
Ten minutes. All right?

07:50.735 --> 07:51.769
Uh, Ter, sorry.

07:51.802 --> 07:52.670
Am I okay there?

07:52.702 --> 07:54.104
Yeah, the van's fine
just where it is.

07:54.137 --> 07:55.239
You're okay to stand in.

07:55.273 --> 07:56.774
We'll just stay close,
all right?

07:56.807 --> 07:58.242
Give me a few minutes,
in a few minutes?

07:58.276 --> 08:00.043
Uh...

08:00.076 --> 08:01.245
Yeah, I can do that.

08:01.278 --> 08:03.180
Just a few minutes though.

08:03.213 --> 08:05.283
Come on.

08:05.315 --> 08:07.217
<i>Okay, so not duck soup?</i>

08:07.250 --> 08:09.219
<i>No, uh... not duck soup
at all.</i>

08:09.252 --> 08:11.055
<i>I mean, right now
we're just looking at,</i>

08:11.088 --> 08:12.757
<i>like, the worst case scenario.</i>

08:12.790 --> 08:13.591
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

08:13.624 --> 08:14.825
<i>And what changed?</i>

08:14.858 --> 08:17.294
<i>Oh, the wind is... is making
its own patterns, it's...</i>

08:17.327 --> 08:19.563
<i>it's folding in on itself.</i>

08:19.596 --> 08:22.567
<i>Get the city, if the...
if those people...</i>

08:22.600 --> 08:23.600
<i>If they didn't put up
such a fuss</i>

08:23.634 --> 08:25.536
<i>about the prescribed burns
over the years,</i>

08:25.569 --> 08:27.838
<i>I mean, now there's trouble,
right?</i>

08:39.283 --> 08:42.153
<i>Look, Stan, I... you know
how this goes, right?</i>

08:42.186 --> 08:44.689
I've gotta give the FIO a
properly worded statement.

08:44.721 --> 08:47.257
Uh, Ter, I mean, I have never
subjected you to tabloid stuff.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.260
They're already using words
like "disastrous"

08:49.293 --> 08:50.227
and "unprecedented."

08:50.260 --> 08:51.596
Of course they are,
because disaster sells.

08:51.629 --> 08:52.697
Well, excuse me.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.264
Uh, pardon me for saying
this, but it's fucked, okay?

08:54.298 --> 08:55.166
No, I agree.

08:55.198 --> 08:56.934
All the press does
is make our lives...

08:56.967 --> 08:57.935
At all costs.

08:57.969 --> 08:59.103
I mean, it's just what
the Pope talked about,

08:59.135 --> 08:59.903
I heard somethin'.

08:59.937 --> 09:00.738
The Pope?

09:00.770 --> 09:01.939
Yeah.

09:01.972 --> 09:03.173
The... the Pope what?

09:03.206 --> 09:04.841
Something, I dunno, something.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.110
He said something.

09:06.143 --> 09:09.247
The point is, you know, they're
all about profit at any cost.

09:09.279 --> 09:11.182
<i>They're... they're...
you know public opinion.</i>

09:11.215 --> 09:12.649
<i>I'm all about public
information.</i>

09:12.682 --> 09:13.784
<i>I'm trying to be of service.</i>

09:13.817 --> 09:15.586
<i>That's all.</i>

09:15.620 --> 09:17.956
<i>Yeah... Well, I... I would be
trusting you to figure out</i>

09:17.989 --> 09:19.857
<i>a way to put it so that you're
not stirring up hysterics.</i>

09:19.889 --> 09:20.824
<i>Yeah. Yes.</i>

09:20.857 --> 09:22.759
<i>I do not want pressure
on our roadblocks.</i>

09:22.793 --> 09:24.962
<i>Right.</i>

09:24.995 --> 09:28.231
So, how does this
work for you, then?

09:28.264 --> 09:29.199
Hm?

09:29.232 --> 09:30.867
You don't profit financially
off disaster.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.202
It's like pennies, Terry.

09:32.235 --> 09:33.670
Oh.

09:34.371 --> 09:35.539
You're kiddin' me.

09:35.572 --> 09:37.741
Stan Hurst is not up there
among the giants of journalism?

09:37.774 --> 09:39.110
I am... I am a local giant.

09:40.211 --> 09:42.046
God knows what the shadow
van over there makes.

09:42.078 --> 09:42.779
Shadow van?

09:42.812 --> 09:44.649
Yeah, the sha...
they shadow me.

09:44.682 --> 09:45.182
They do!

09:45.216 --> 09:45.984
Oh yeah?

09:46.017 --> 09:46.685
Yes.

09:46.717 --> 09:47.685
Well, watch out for them, then.

09:47.719 --> 09:51.189
<i>They probably make more
than a fire chief.</i>

09:51.221 --> 09:55.192
The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

09:55.225 --> 09:58.629
There it is.
There's the endorphins.

11:38.428 --> 11:40.398
Okay, okay...

12:17.534 --> 12:19.903
Peachland Voice dot ca.

12:19.937 --> 12:21.004
<i>Hi, is this Stan Hurst?</i>

12:21.038 --> 12:22.105
Yeah, it is.

12:22.139 --> 12:23.807
<i>Hi, this is Patrick.</i>

12:23.841 --> 12:26.543
<i>I'm a correspondent here with
Canada Media News Network.</i>

12:26.576 --> 12:27.745
Uh, yeah?

12:27.778 --> 12:30.380
<i>I see on your site you're
pretty close to the fire.</i>

12:30.413 --> 12:33.016
Yes I am, I'm actually, uh,
well beyond the blockade.

12:33.049 --> 12:35.152
I've been here since the
evacuation order went down

12:35.186 --> 12:38.122
at the Upper Trepanier
around 2:00 this afternoon.

12:38.154 --> 12:39.557
<i>Okay. And you're still there?</i>

12:39.590 --> 12:40.625
Uh, yes I am.

12:40.658 --> 12:42.826
I'm planning on being here
all through the night.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.294
<i>Okay, perfect.</i>

12:44.327 --> 12:46.163
<i>Stan, can you tell me
what happened?</i>

12:46.197 --> 12:48.566
Well, as... as you know,
fire seasons in BC

12:48.599 --> 12:50.968
have gotten worse
every single year.

12:51.999 --> 12:52.970
Uh, and our worst nightmares
happened,

12:53.003 --> 12:56.073
uh, this year, uh,
when a wildfire was fanned

12:56.105 --> 12:58.241
into flame by high winds.

12:58.274 --> 13:01.444
But I have to say
the, uh, fire crew,

13:01.477 --> 13:02.913
the emergency workers
down here

13:02.947 --> 13:04.381
have just done
an incredible job.

13:04.414 --> 13:06.950
They've kept everybody safe,
they've been fighting the fire.

13:06.984 --> 13:09.120
They're just, they're the best
people on the ground.

13:09.153 --> 13:14.992
Uh... But, the fire, uh,
it just keeps coming.

13:15.024 --> 13:17.928
<i>Uh-huh. Listen.</i>

13:17.961 --> 13:19.429
<i>I'd love to give you a live
interview tomorrow morning</i>

13:19.462 --> 13:21.464
<i>on national television.</i>

13:21.498 --> 13:23.600
Okay.

13:23.634 --> 13:26.037
<i>Uh, 7:15 AM pacific time?</i>

13:26.070 --> 13:28.306
<i>Is that okay,
can you do that?</i>

13:28.339 --> 13:31.075
Uh, yeah, no, I think
I could do that.

13:31.107 --> 13:32.309
<i>Okay, perfect.</i>

13:32.342 --> 13:33.577
<i>Is this the number?</i>

13:33.610 --> 13:35.145
<i>It'll be one of our
top stories.</i>

13:35.178 --> 13:38.348
Yup, this... this number
is the number.

13:38.381 --> 13:41.117
<i>Okay. Talk to you in
a few hours then, Stan.</i>

13:41.150 --> 13:42.385
Okay.

13:42.418 --> 13:43.221
<i>Keep safe.</i>

13:43.254 --> 13:44.422
Thank you.

13:44.455 --> 13:45.256
<i>Bye.</i>

13:45.288 --> 13:46.524
Bye.

13:56.267 --> 13:57.602
I'm Stan Hurst.

13:57.634 --> 13:58.936
Hello, Stan Hurst...

14:07.912 --> 14:09.113
Fuck you, shadow van!

14:09.145 --> 14:10.046
Fuck you.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.549
Fuck you, shadow van!

14:11.581 --> 14:13.417
You wanna, fuuuck you!

14:13.450 --> 14:16.221
Fuck you, shadow van.

14:17.388 --> 14:18.656
Oh hey, shadow van guys.

14:18.688 --> 14:22.894
Guess what I'm doin'?
I'm on the fuckin' news!

14:22.927 --> 14:24.162
Fuckers.

14:36.173 --> 14:37.041
<i>Mishu!</i>

14:37.073 --> 14:38.241
<i>Oh my god, Gail.</i>

14:38.274 --> 14:39.543
<i>Please tell me everything
is okay.</i>

14:39.576 --> 14:41.045
<i>Canada Media News
Network called,</i>

14:41.077 --> 14:42.379
<i>they wanna interview me.</i>

14:42.413 --> 14:43.081
<i>What?</i>

14:43.114 --> 14:47.118
<i>Yes! Tomorrow morning, 7:15.</i>

14:47.150 --> 14:47.918
<i>Come home!</i>

14:47.951 --> 14:49.287
<i>I will.</i>

14:49.320 --> 14:51.289
<i>Christ on a cracker,
I need a shower.</i>

14:51.322 --> 14:52.657
<i>And a cup of coffee.</i>

14:52.690 --> 14:54.625
<i>Hun, I can't believe it.</i>

14:54.658 --> 14:56.159
<i>Busy, busy.</i>

14:56.192 --> 14:57.662
<i>Okay, I have to go,
I'm gonna try my luck.</i>

14:57.695 --> 14:58.663
<i>I think I'm the only
one here.</i>

14:58.696 --> 15:00.932
<i>The shadow van's back
at the roadblock.</i>

15:00.965 --> 15:03.567
<i>I know. They're using
your photos again.</i>

15:04.668 --> 15:07.437
<i>You know, once... once bitten,
twice whatever.</i>

15:38.201 --> 15:41.272
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things

15:41.304 --> 15:43.340
I cannot change.

15:43.374 --> 15:45.576
The courage to change
the things I can,

15:45.609 --> 15:48.646
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

15:48.678 --> 15:51.348
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things

15:51.381 --> 15:53.717
I cannot change.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.552
The courage to change
the things I can,

15:55.586 --> 15:59.123
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

15:59.155 --> 16:00.657
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things

16:00.691 --> 16:01.591
I cannot change.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.159
The courage to change
the things I can,

16:03.192 --> 16:05.062
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

17:12.429 --> 17:15.598
There it is.

17:15.632 --> 17:21.238
The domain.

17:21.270 --> 17:23.138
That's my house.

17:23.173 --> 17:26.509
Wife always leaves the porch
light on for me.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.278
Nice.

18:10.453 --> 18:12.856
There's the endorphins.

18:19.363 --> 18:21.132

<i>Yesterday afternoon, almost 2000
people were made</i>

18:34.211 --> 18:38.615
<i>to wait for hours in the heat,
only to be told to turn around.</i>

18:38.648 --> 18:42.485
<i>Some were told they may not
have a home to return to.</i>

18:42.519 --> 18:45.189
<i>High River has been
evacuated and...</i>

18:45.221 --> 18:46.456
<i>virtually vacant for 10 days.</i>

<i>Without power, sewage,

19:06.476 --> 19:07.311
Hello?

19:07.344 --> 19:09.279
<i>Stan. Patrick.</i>

19:09.313 --> 19:11.348
So, you're gonna be interviewed
by Kendra here in a few minutes.

19:11.381 --> 19:12.716
Okay.

19:12.749 --> 19:13.750
<i>How's your reception?</i>

19:13.784 --> 19:18.756
Um... It... it... it's good.
I have four bars.

19:18.788 --> 19:20.790
<i>All right. Uh... this
interview's gonna be quick.</i>

19:20.824 --> 19:21.792
<i>Not too long.</i>

19:21.825 --> 19:22.660
Okay.

19:22.692 --> 19:23.661
<i>Only a few questions.</i>

19:23.693 --> 19:25.328
<i>Uh... we've blocked a minute
and a half.</i>

19:25.362 --> 19:26.864
Okay, perfect.

19:28.865 --> 19:30.032
Okay, perfect.

19:30.066 --> 19:31.602
<i>...The 30 minute bus tours
that are being conducted</i>

19:31.634 --> 19:33.503
<i>throughout the town.</i>

19:33.537 --> 19:36.273
<i>These tours will provide
an opportunity for residents</i>

19:36.306 --> 19:37.975
<i>to see their homes for
the first time since...</i>

19:38.008 --> 19:39.509
<i>So, did you get any sleep?</i>

19:39.542 --> 19:40.743
Um, no.

19:40.778 --> 19:43.980
No, I mean, actually, uh, I was
actually out on the fire line,

19:44.013 --> 19:46.849
uh, all night last night,
which was pretty intense,

19:46.883 --> 19:48.986
a privilege I was granted
I was taking photographs.

19:49.019 --> 19:51.355
I actually, um,
helped out in the...

19:56.727 --> 19:58.362
Hello?

20:01.530 --> 20:03.300
Hello?

20:07.871 --> 20:11.976
<i>...Yeah, it's... obviously never
expected this to happen,</i>

20:12.009 --> 20:14.979
<i>we unfortunately can't even...</i>

20:18.481 --> 20:19.649
<i>Okay, Stan.</i>

20:19.682 --> 20:21.652
<i>I'm gonna hand you off to Ken,
and you'll be live, yeah?</i>

20:21.684 --> 20:22.852
Okay, thank you.

20:22.885 --> 20:24.587
That's great.

20:24.621 --> 20:28.359
<i>The events have taken a
devastating turn as more than...</i>

20:31.028 --> 20:34.798
<i>We are now joined by a live
caller from Peachlandvoice. ca,</i>

20:34.830 --> 20:37.032
<i>who was at the scene
when it happened.</i>

20:41.238 --> 20:43.740
I'm... I'm sorry, can you...
can you repeat that, please?

20:43.773 --> 20:45.375
<i>I was just asking how you are.</i>

20:45.409 --> 20:48.312
Oh, I'm, uh, I'm good,
I'm fine. I'm tired.

20:48.345 --> 20:50.713
I'm, uh, you know,
which is, uh,

20:50.747 --> 20:53.717
kind of, I guess,
job description.

20:54.684 --> 20:56.854
Uh, as I'm sure I don't have
to tell you.

20:56.886 --> 20:58.087
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

20:58.122 --> 21:02.026
<i>Can you tell us how it feels to
be in Peachland at the moment?</i>

21:02.058 --> 21:06.297
Yeah, well, uh, Peachland is,
uh, under a state of emergency.

21:06.329 --> 21:07.330
I'm looking out the window
right now,

21:07.365 --> 21:10.733
there's, uh, just a huge,
um, column of smoke.

21:10.767 --> 21:13.003
I've spoken with a lot of
the residents here and,

21:13.036 --> 21:16.640
uh, what I can tell you is
it's very, very emotional.

21:16.673 --> 21:17.974
It's... it's chaos.

21:18.008 --> 21:22.446
It's, uh, it's a zoo here.

21:22.479 --> 21:24.048
<i>Can you take us back
to yesterday</i>

21:24.080 --> 21:25.815
<i>and tell us about
the fire behaviour?</i>

21:25.848 --> 21:27.851
Uh, yeah.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.355
<i>Can you tell us about that,
please?</i>

21:31.387 --> 21:34.090
Um, well at about 3:30
yesterday afternoon,

21:34.124 --> 21:36.527
uh, the weather shifted,
uh, we have,

21:36.559 --> 21:39.929
uh, wind here in the Okanagan,
that um,

21:39.962 --> 21:42.832
that... that, uh, turned,
and it, uh,

21:42.865 --> 21:45.435
came down off the mountains,
pushing the fire in..

21:45.469 --> 21:47.004
into the valley.

21:47.037 --> 21:49.373
<i>Do you know if we have lost
any structures in Peachland</i>

21:49.405 --> 21:50.807
<i>due to this wildfire?</i>

21:50.840 --> 21:53.076
Yeah.

21:53.109 --> 21:55.645
<i>I'm... I'm sorry, can you...
can you repeat that please?</i>

21:55.679 --> 21:57.014
<i>I was just asking how you are.</i>

21:57.047 --> 21:59.482
<i>Hello, are you still there?</i>

21:59.516 --> 22:01.719
Hey!

22:01.751 --> 22:03.619
<i>So, we have had
reports of...</i>

22:03.653 --> 22:06.056
There, there have been
structures lost, but um...

22:06.088 --> 22:10.094
But uh, but I'm, uh, I'm not,
uh, I can't comment,

22:10.126 --> 22:12.363
I can't comment
about that right now.

22:12.395 --> 22:15.098
<i>Well, we're getting reports of
approximately 10 structures</i>

22:15.132 --> 22:17.034
<i>lost to this wildfire.</i>

22:17.067 --> 22:18.736
<i>Would you say that is correct?</i>

22:18.769 --> 22:20.436
Um, yeah.

22:20.470 --> 22:23.973
That sounds about right to me.

22:24.007 --> 22:28.045
Um, and... and also, uh,
and three outbuildings.

22:28.077 --> 22:30.114
<i>Are you able to tell us
about the fire,</i>

22:30.146 --> 22:31.147
<i>and the status currently?</i>

22:31.181 --> 22:38.555
All right, um, the uh,
okay...

22:38.587 --> 22:40.089
<i>Okay, I think we're going
to have to let you go.</i>

22:40.123 --> 22:41.759
<i>Unfortunately, we have some
technical difficulties</i>

22:41.791 --> 22:43.459
<i>that we are dealing...</i>

22:43.492 --> 22:45.395
Uh, the... the... the, uh,
the fire,

22:45.429 --> 22:47.431
uh, is zero percent contained
at 5,000 hectares,

22:47.463 --> 22:49.432
um, and that's expected
to double,

22:49.465 --> 22:52.402
uh, in... in the next 24
hours... um, also the...

22:52.435 --> 22:53.636

24:50.720 --> 24:51.954
<i>Listen, I was talking to Trish,</i>

24:51.988 --> 24:54.591
<i>and, uh, she said she caught
your interview on the TV there,</i>

24:54.624 --> 24:55.592
<i>and uh...</i>

24:55.625 --> 24:58.628
<i>Oh man. I'm glad...
I'm glad it wasn't me.</i>

24:58.662 --> 25:00.096
<i>Uh, it's tough to do
that kind of stuff.</i>

25:00.130 --> 25:02.699
<i>But, uh, she says you got
some good facts out there</i>

25:02.731 --> 25:08.004
<i>on the air and, uh... well,
get some sleep, huh?</i>

25:08.038 --> 25:10.673
<i>I'm sure you'll get another
crack at it.</i>

25:18.682 --> 25:21.183
<i>What's wrong?</i>

25:21.217 --> 25:24.086
What do you mean?

25:24.119 --> 25:27.924
<i>Well, I don't know.
You've been quiet.</i>

25:27.958 --> 25:31.961
Yeah. I know.

25:31.994 --> 25:34.964
I can't shut my brain off.

25:41.938 --> 25:42.739
Work?

25:42.771 --> 25:44.707
<i>Eh, maybe.</i>

25:48.077 --> 25:51.315
No breaks. And Canada
Day tomorrow.

25:51.347 --> 25:55.853
<i>Oh god, our glory days.</i>

25:57.220 --> 26:02.058
<i>Does it feel like
I'm underwater?</i>

26:02.092 --> 26:04.895
<i>Fallin' asleep.</i>

26:47.069 --> 26:48.938
<i>First job was working
at the ice cream store</i>

26:48.971 --> 26:51.208
<i>and working at the pet store.</i>

26:51.240 --> 26:55.244
<i>And bringing animals home,
animals nobody knew about.</i>

26:55.278 --> 26:57.314
<i>And thinking your father was
gonna have a heart attack</i>

26:57.346 --> 27:01.218
<i>when he saw the chickens.</i>

27:01.250 --> 27:05.355
<i>And your father saying
he was proud,</i>

27:05.387 --> 27:12.695
<i>but wondering if he'd still feel
that way when he was sober.</i>

27:12.729 --> 27:18.300
<i>And rolling a boat out onto
the ocean with the luminescence.</i>

27:18.334 --> 27:20.703
<i>And every time you
pulled the oars,</i>

27:20.737 --> 27:22.172
<i>seeing them in the water,</i>

27:22.204 --> 27:25.741
<i>reflecting up like
swirling galaxies,</i>

27:25.775 --> 27:29.880
<i>and the calm water
reflecting the real galaxies</i>

27:29.913 --> 27:32.915
<i>without being able to see
the horizon line.</i>

27:32.949 --> 27:38.188
<i>Not knowing where you ended
and where space began,</i>

27:38.221 --> 27:44.428
<i>and the quiet sound of the ocean
rolling into the shore,</i>

27:44.461 --> 27:49.098
<i>the "shhh", the same "shhh"
that leaves make</i>

27:49.132 --> 27:51.268
<i>when they're blown in the fall.</i>

27:51.300 --> 27:54.403
<i>The same "shhh"
that your mother made</i>

27:54.436 --> 27:59.375
<i>when she tried to tell you
it was okay to be quiet.</i>

32:04.019 --> 32:06.056
<i>Um, also, I wanted
to mention quickly,</i>

32:06.088 --> 32:08.457
<i>I know it's hot out there,
and we want to get</i>

32:08.490 --> 32:12.394
<i>to the cake cutting, but um,
we'd like to acknowledge</i>

32:12.428 --> 32:14.397
<i>all of the residents
of Peachland</i>

32:14.430 --> 32:19.602
<i>as well as the staff and
forestry workers, everyone.</i>

32:19.634 --> 32:22.004
<i>We're also working on it
after the fireworks,</i>

32:22.038 --> 32:25.241
<i>and we'll have more details
about that soon...</i>

32:26.608 --> 32:28.010
<i>All right hey, we got the...</i>

32:28.044 --> 32:29.278
<i>we got the big drumming
happening</i>

32:29.311 --> 32:31.313
<i>right here under the shade.</i>

32:31.346 --> 32:32.248
<i>You're gonna love it.</i>

32:32.281 --> 32:33.515
<i>We want all the kids
to come on down</i>

32:33.548 --> 32:36.185
<i>and drum your
little hearts out.</i>

32:36.219 --> 32:37.420
We got some cake happening.

32:37.452 --> 32:40.089
The Canada,
happy birthday cake.

32:40.123 --> 32:41.124
You're gonna wanna
have that,

32:41.156 --> 32:45.627
<i>because hey, you gotta...</i>

32:45.661 --> 32:49.032
<i>We got the sack races happening
in front of me.</i>

33:08.183 --> 33:09.251
Hey.

33:09.285 --> 33:10.586
<i>Hey. Honey.</i>

33:10.619 --> 33:13.322
<i>You... you might wanna
come back to the house.</i>

33:13.355 --> 33:14.723
<i>I think there must be
a drug bust</i>

33:14.757 --> 33:16.558
or something happening close by.

33:16.592 --> 33:18.194
There's a ghost car
right out front.

33:18.227 --> 33:19.062
No way.

33:19.095 --> 33:20.230
<i>Yes, way.</i>

33:23.665 --> 33:24.800
<i>Stan, there's another one.</i>

33:24.834 --> 33:27.037
<i>It's... it's in our driveway.</i>

33:27.069 --> 33:27.736
How many?

33:27.769 --> 33:28.605
<i>Hang on.</i>

33:28.637 --> 33:30.439
<i>They're getting out.</i>

33:31.173 --> 33:33.542
<i>They're... they're pointing
at the hou...</i>

33:33.576 --> 33:36.512
<i>Stan, I think they're looking
for someone.</i>

33:36.546 --> 33:38.448
<i>Wait, they're...
they're coming here.</i>

33:39.714 --> 33:42.651
<i>Hold on, Stan.</i>

33:42.684 --> 33:43.485
<i>Yes?</i>

33:43.519 --> 33:44.520
<i>Mrs Hurst?</i>

33:44.554 --> 33:45.522
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:45.555 --> 33:48.258
<i>We have a warrant to search
your house.</i>

33:48.523 --> 33:51.360
<i>Hey, Baxter, behind the dresser.</i>

33:51.394 --> 33:54.431
<i>You got any doors in here,
any trapdoors or hatch doors?</i>

34:39.608 --> 34:41.143
Sorry.

34:55.257 --> 34:56.125
Here's Stan.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.260
I...

35:00.862 --> 35:01.897
<i>You Stanley Hurst?</i>

35:01.931 --> 35:02.965
Yeah.

35:02.998 --> 35:04.701
<i>I'm Officer Oaks with
the Okanagan Regional</i>

35:04.733 --> 35:07.136
<i>Police Service.</i>

35:07.170 --> 35:10.472
<i>We're, uh, here as part of a
child pornography investigation.</i>

35:10.505 --> 35:11.875
<i>We have a warrant
to search your house.</i>

35:11.907 --> 35:13.409
<i>You won't be able to go
into your house</i>

35:13.442 --> 35:16.579
<i>until after the investigation
is over.</i>

35:16.612 --> 35:17.813
No.

35:17.847 --> 35:22.585
<i>Now, I'm gonna have to ask you
to surrender your phone.</i>

35:22.617 --> 35:25.654
Um, it's... it's in my van.

35:25.688 --> 35:26.856
<i>Uh, where is your vehicle?</i>

35:26.889 --> 35:30.626
Uh, Beach and... and 4th.

35:30.659 --> 35:32.928
<i>Okay, um, I'm gonna need
your keys.</i>

35:32.961 --> 35:36.266
<i>The, uh, warrant covers
motor vehicles</i>

35:36.298 --> 35:39.601
<i>under your ownership as well.</i>

35:39.635 --> 35:41.871
They're in the van, sorry.

35:41.903 --> 35:47.576
<i>Okay. Um, we'll grab them
and return them to you later.</i>

35:47.610 --> 35:50.346
<i>Stanley. No one's under arrest.</i>

35:50.378 --> 35:51.614
<i>No one's being detained.</i>

35:51.646 --> 35:52.648
<i>You're free to go.</i>

35:52.681 --> 35:55.284
<i>Once you, uh, grab a coffee
or something,</i>

35:55.318 --> 35:56.419
<i>come back in a few hours</i>

35:56.452 --> 35:58.288
<i>after the officers are done
their investigation.</i>

35:58.320 --> 36:01.257
Okay.

36:01.289 --> 36:02.791
Where's... where's he going?

36:02.824 --> 36:05.227
He's just... He...

36:50.840 --> 36:52.508
Mrs Hurst, I know this
is difficult,

36:52.541 --> 36:56.246
but I need to ask you
a few questions.

36:56.278 --> 36:58.248
Late last night, an undercover
police officer was chatting

36:58.280 --> 37:00.516
with someone on the internet
at the IP address

37:00.548 --> 37:04.454
associated with your house.

37:04.487 --> 37:06.289
I'm afraid to say this,

37:06.322 --> 37:12.961
but that conversation
involved children and sex.

37:12.994 --> 37:18.433
Does your husband travel a lot
for business, Mrs. Hurst?

37:18.467 --> 37:20.869
No.

37:20.902 --> 37:22.304
<i>Does your husband spend
much time with people</i>

37:22.338 --> 37:23.506
<i>under the age of 16?</i>

37:23.539 --> 37:25.008
<i>Is there anyone
under the age of 16</i>

37:25.041 --> 37:26.809
<i>that your husband might have
direct contact...</i>

37:26.842 --> 37:30.713
No. No, there's no one.
There's no one.

37:30.746 --> 37:32.815
What kind of books does
your husband like to read?

37:32.847 --> 37:34.284
I'm sorry.

37:34.317 --> 37:35.518
I can't answer these questions
right now.

37:35.550 --> 37:36.384
<i>I understand, Mrs Hurst.</i>

37:36.418 --> 37:37.719
But these questions
are to ascertain

37:37.753 --> 37:40.957
if there is anyone
in immediate danger.

37:40.989 --> 37:43.759
Look, I know my husband.
I know Stan.

37:43.793 --> 37:48.798
I'm sure you do, Mrs. Hurst.

37:48.831 --> 37:51.300
I need to ask you a few
questions about your sex life.

37:51.333 --> 37:54.436
Jesus.

37:55.938 --> 37:57.673
<i>Does your husband ever
ask you to do anything</i>

37:57.706 --> 37:59.509
<i>that you feel is inappropriate?</i>

38:01.443 --> 38:03.913
<i>Anything that makes you
feel uncomfortable in any way?</i>

43:47.422 --> 43:50.792
<i>Smell of pine trees.</i>

43:50.826 --> 43:55.431
<i>Smell of flowers.</i>

43:55.463 --> 44:01.770
<i>And the smell of Gail.</i>

44:01.804 --> 44:10.913
<i>And feeling the overwhelming
responsibility of trust.</i>

44:26.461 --> 44:33.969
<i>And feeling the rain,
feeling the rain come down.</i>

44:34.001 --> 44:41.744
<i>Gentle rain you've wanted,
all the things you'd miss.</i>

44:50.452 --> 44:53.956
<i>All the things you'd miss.</i>

47:54.369 --> 47:57.673
Stan? Stan!

47:57.706 --> 47:59.375
Gail?

47:59.407 --> 48:01.610
I can't! I can't!

48:01.643 --> 48:02.677
Yes, you can.

48:02.710 --> 48:04.512
Yes, you can.

48:04.545 --> 48:09.617
You get over here and
you get in this house.

48:09.650 --> 48:13.955
Right fucking now!

49:40.275 --> 49:42.278
<i>Where did you go?</i>

49:46.280 --> 49:48.717
<i>Police were here
for a long time.</i>

49:48.750 --> 49:54.123
<i>They went through everything.</i>

49:54.155 --> 50:01.697
<i>And they asked me questions
that uh... I couldn't answer.</i>

50:07.568 --> 50:11.172
<i>They were out there looking
for you until it got dark.</i>

50:30.192 --> 50:33.228
Did you do what the
police say you did?

50:35.697 --> 50:37.666
I can't do this again.

50:44.371 --> 50:46.741
<i>Evacuation order.</i>

50:46.775 --> 50:51.646
<i>All properties on Beach Avenue,
Lake Avenue and...</i>

52:06.655 --> 52:07.523
Talk.

52:07.556 --> 52:08.824
Okay.

52:08.856 --> 52:15.329
Are you gonna tell me
what happened?

52:15.362 --> 52:21.669
I don't... I don't even know if
I know how to say it properly.

52:21.702 --> 52:27.242
I don't care about proper, Stan.

52:27.275 --> 52:33.315
What were you doing up there?

52:33.347 --> 52:37.552
I thought if I killed myself,
you only would be better off.

52:43.592 --> 52:45.561
Oh...

52:47.596 --> 52:50.565
I'm sorry.

52:55.670 --> 52:56.738
I went into a chatroom.

52:56.771 --> 52:58.473
Mm-mm. Stop.

52:58.505 --> 52:59.307
I love you, Gail.

52:59.340 --> 52:59.907
Stop.

52:59.940 --> 53:00.741
I love you.

53:00.775 --> 53:02.344
Shh.

53:11.452 --> 53:13.721
I wrote horrible things.

53:13.755 --> 53:18.626
I did. I wrote horrible,
horrible things.

53:26.268 --> 53:30.271
Who were you talking to?

53:30.304 --> 53:33.474
Other people who wrote
horrible things.

53:36.577 --> 53:38.880
Who are you?

53:52.427 --> 53:56.632
So the police, the police are
gonna find this... this chat.

53:56.664 --> 53:59.567
Yeah, they'll probably
find them.

53:59.601 --> 54:02.503
Them?

54:02.536 --> 54:07.509
Stan, how many?

54:07.541 --> 54:09.010
I don't know.

54:09.043 --> 54:09.978
What do you mean,
you don't know?

54:10.012 --> 54:12.014
You don't know like you don't
want to say

54:12.047 --> 54:15.016
or you don't know because
there are too many?

54:15.050 --> 54:16.285
Both.

54:22.724 --> 54:26.361
How long?

54:26.393 --> 54:28.429
I'm so sorry, Gail.

54:28.463 --> 54:29.965
I'm so sorry.

54:29.998 --> 54:31.465
Are there pictures, or video...

54:31.498 --> 54:32.433
No, no, no, no.

54:32.467 --> 54:34.836
Nothing. Never. Never.

54:34.869 --> 54:36.972
I promise you.

54:49.451 --> 54:51.686
How do I believe you?

54:59.661 --> 55:02.563
Oh, my god.

55:06.300 --> 55:08.503
You really, you
really wrote about

55:08.536 --> 55:12.374
having sex
with children?

57:06.653 --> 57:11.760
After the police left
here that day,

57:11.793 --> 57:17.097
I had a lot of time
to think.

57:17.130 --> 57:24.905
I thought about when you
asked me to marry you,

57:24.938 --> 57:31.946
thought about everything
that you have given and taken.

57:37.150 --> 57:42.790
Thought about every night
I would say goodnight

57:42.824 --> 57:46.894
and you would say goodnight,
and...

57:46.927 --> 57:50.665
We'd tell each other
I love you.

57:56.271 --> 57:58.841
You meant that.

58:00.208 --> 58:02.577
I feel it.

58:07.981 --> 58:12.887
I do know you, Stan.

58:12.920 --> 58:17.091
I know you.

58:23.197 --> 58:28.236
But then the sun went down,
and oh god, I got so angry.

58:28.268 --> 58:31.672
Oh, I was more than... than
angry, I was furious, actually.

58:31.706 --> 58:32.574
I know.

58:32.606 --> 58:35.543
No, no. Not now.

58:35.577 --> 58:40.081
You left me after everything.

58:40.114 --> 58:42.818
You left me.

58:56.063 --> 58:58.132
I wasn't just angry, though.

58:58.166 --> 59:01.570
I... I... I... There was
something else I...

59:01.603 --> 59:08.976
I kept thinking about...
about you, Stan, the...

59:09.010 --> 59:11.713
My husband.

59:18.652 --> 59:20.655
I don't know.

59:23.958 --> 59:27.829
What makes me
the stronger person?

59:29.163 --> 59:31.666
Stay?

59:31.699 --> 59:33.168
Leave?

59:44.945 --> 59:48.083
<i>I'm gonna tell you everything.</i>

01:00:03.063 --> 01:00:11.172
I'm spinning, spinning like...
like a panic attack.

01:00:11.204 --> 01:00:17.144
<i>And would you say these thoughts
are more like images, or urges?</i>

01:00:17.177 --> 01:00:18.179
<i>Both.</i>

01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:26.186
<i>And what is the content
of the images?</i>

01:00:26.219 --> 01:00:30.357
<i>Well, I mean,
they're all kinds of...</i>

01:00:30.391 --> 01:00:36.697
<i>Uh, the worst of them
have to do with kids.</i>

01:00:36.731 --> 01:00:40.301
<i>Mmhmm.</i>

01:00:40.333 --> 01:00:42.936
<i>Are you comfortable giving me
more details?</i>

01:00:42.969 --> 01:00:44.672
No. Comfortable?

01:00:47.842 --> 01:00:54.048
It's sexual images.

01:00:54.081 --> 01:01:01.388
And how do you feel in response
to these thoughts?

01:01:01.422 --> 01:01:05.260
Shameful.

01:01:05.293 --> 01:01:07.762
You know, aft... after
the thought pops up,

01:01:07.795 --> 01:01:09.931
I'll... I'll spend hours
and hours thinking about,

01:01:09.963 --> 01:01:18.273
uh, you know, whether or not
I'm... I'm a pedophile.

01:01:18.306 --> 01:01:19.840
You know?

01:01:19.873 --> 01:01:21.341
Just spinning, spinning.

01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:25.012
Whether... whether
I'm a child molester,

01:01:25.045 --> 01:01:28.048
or... or am I capable of...
of committing rape

01:01:28.081 --> 01:01:30.317
or murdering somebody.

01:01:30.351 --> 01:01:31.286
<i>Violent thoughts too?</i>

01:01:31.318 --> 01:01:33.153
Yeah.

01:01:33.186 --> 01:01:35.155
Like, I'll be driving,
and I'll just...

01:01:35.188 --> 01:01:37.024
I'll suddenly think you know,
uh, I...

01:01:37.057 --> 01:01:38.293
I could just turn the wheel,

01:01:38.326 --> 01:01:41.496
I could drive straight headlong
into traffic.

01:01:41.528 --> 01:01:48.001
Or one time, I thought, uh,
there's a pregnant woman I saw,

01:01:48.034 --> 01:01:49.269
and I thought I could
just kick her.

01:01:49.302 --> 01:01:51.472
I could kick her right
in the stomach,

01:01:51.505 --> 01:01:56.777
as hard as...
as hard as I can.

01:01:56.811 --> 01:01:58.480
And also other, like,
thoughts.

01:01:58.512 --> 01:02:02.250
Like, countless, like, um,
uh, did I lock the car,

01:02:02.282 --> 01:02:03.250
did I lock the car?

01:02:03.284 --> 01:02:05.920
Or um, I have these, like,
horrible thoughts,

01:02:05.952 --> 01:02:08.056
that I don't know
if they're real.

01:02:08.088 --> 01:02:10.891
Like, did uh, did I... I...

01:02:10.925 --> 01:02:14.262
did I run over somebody
with my van?

01:02:14.295 --> 01:02:19.067
<i>Let's say, in a typical day,
how much time do you spend</i>

01:02:19.099 --> 01:02:22.469
<i>preoccupied with these
sorts of thoughts.</i>

01:02:22.503 --> 01:02:27.342
Uh, I mean, you know,
on a good day, hours.

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:30.144
On a stressful day, it...
it could be,

01:02:30.177 --> 01:02:33.480
uh, days or weeks.

01:02:33.514 --> 01:02:35.383
Hmm.

01:02:35.416 --> 01:02:38.253
I'm curious.

01:02:38.286 --> 01:02:42.423
What were you hoping
to experience or discover

01:02:42.456 --> 01:02:48.028
in the chat room?

01:02:48.061 --> 01:02:48.929
Why did I do it?

01:02:48.963 --> 01:02:50.298
Why did I...

01:02:55.836 --> 01:02:58.306
I think I wanted
to understand the thoughts,

01:02:58.338 --> 01:02:59.940
or that's what I told myself.

01:02:59.974 --> 01:03:03.010
If... if I wrote it down,
if I typed it,

01:03:03.043 --> 01:03:05.846
I mean, that never worked,
but...

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.017
Or, uh, if... if... if
I could find somebody,

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:11.586
if I could find other people
like me,

01:03:11.619 --> 01:03:15.155
maybe I could understand
myself better.

01:03:15.188 --> 01:03:19.527
And during the chatting,
um, would you masturbate?

01:03:19.559 --> 01:03:22.529
No.

01:03:22.563 --> 01:03:24.566
Were you aroused?

01:03:28.869 --> 01:03:33.307
No.

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.342
Well, uh, no.

01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:35.943
I had, I mean, I had feelings,

01:03:35.976 --> 01:03:39.446
I had, my heart would race,
pound, um...

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:45.152
I'd have tingling sensations
in my hand, my arms.

01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:47.521
And after the chat?

01:03:47.554 --> 01:03:52.492
After, after, uh, I'd spend
hours hating myself.

01:03:52.525 --> 01:03:55.562
Just think and think and think
about the horrible things

01:03:55.596 --> 01:03:58.365
I said and wonder
why I said 'em.

01:03:58.398 --> 01:04:05.373
Spinning, did that make me, was
that proof I was a pedophile.

01:04:05.405 --> 01:04:06.239
You know.

01:04:06.273 --> 01:04:08.609
Were they thoughts or...
or fantasies?

01:04:08.643 --> 01:04:10.846
Was... was... was it real?

01:04:17.451 --> 01:04:18.987
My worst fear.

01:04:23.391 --> 01:04:26.094
Okay. Your worst fear?

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:37.538
Was that I'd hurt a kid.

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.275
This is making sense to me.

01:04:45.079 --> 01:04:48.583
It sounds to me that you were
after clarity,

01:04:48.615 --> 01:04:50.083
one way or another,

01:04:50.117 --> 01:04:52.186
as to why you have these
thoughts or fantasies.

01:04:52.219 --> 01:04:57.992
Do you think that's the case?

01:04:58.025 --> 01:05:01.262
From what you're telling me,
you weren't going online

01:05:01.295 --> 01:05:04.965
into these chatrooms
for sexual gratification,

01:05:04.998 --> 01:05:08.368
you were there to...
learn about yourself.

01:05:08.402 --> 01:05:15.108
To find out if you're
a pedophile.

01:05:15.141 --> 01:05:16.977
Yeah.

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:20.648
<i>Well, what you're describing
sounds to me like it could be</i>

01:05:20.681 --> 01:05:24.085
<i>consistent with Obsessive
Compulsive Disorder.</i>

01:05:24.117 --> 01:05:26.721
<i>Not pedophilic preference.</i>

01:05:26.753 --> 01:05:30.324
<i>Intrusive thought, unwanted
thoughts that involve</i>

01:05:30.358 --> 01:05:31.626
<i>sex with children,</i>

01:05:31.659 --> 01:05:36.297
<i>can be a trait of OCD
and not that uncommon.</i>

01:05:36.329 --> 01:05:38.699
<i>In fact there's...</i>

01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:41.702
<i>Walking the hallway of the old
folks home for the last time</i>

01:05:41.735 --> 01:05:44.105
<i>and seeing your father's
face one last time,</i>

01:05:44.137 --> 01:05:50.043
<i>and making the decision
to turn and walk away.</i>

01:05:50.077 --> 01:05:52.714
<i>And sickness and melanoma,
and anesthesia,</i>

01:05:52.746 --> 01:05:57.617
<i>and counting backwards,
and cancer scares.</i>

01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:00.320
<i>And cancer.</i>

01:06:00.353 --> 01:06:02.356
<i>And hearing your feet
on the floor of the church</i>

01:06:02.389 --> 01:06:05.158
<i>when you're coming in
too late.</i>

01:06:05.192 --> 01:06:07.161
<i>And the whispers from the nuns,</i>

01:06:07.193 --> 01:06:10.264
<i>and watching the gold
collection plate go by.</i>

01:06:10.898 --> 01:06:16.037
<i>Salmon croquettes, and
the big fan in the summer,</i>

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:20.307
<i>and pushing the oscillator
so it would just stay on you,</i>

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:24.679
<i>and your brother yelling
at you.</i>

01:06:24.711 --> 01:06:25.947
<i>And looking at the shag carpet</i>

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:32.253
<i>and thinking it looked like
snakes when you had the flu.</i>

01:06:32.286 --> 01:06:35.655
<i>And always thinking it looked
like snakes after that.</i>

01:06:35.688 --> 01:06:38.592
<i>And the times in the night
when it felt like the wind</i>

01:06:38.626 --> 01:06:42.130
<i>was breath on your cheek,</i>

01:06:42.163 --> 01:06:46.634
<i>the silence and joy and
possibility on your cheek,</i>

01:06:46.666 --> 01:06:48.435
<i>and holding onto that,</i>

01:06:48.469 --> 01:06:51.139
<i>and holding onto the smell
of barbecue,</i>

01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:53.074
<i>and holding on to the way
the asphalt</i>

01:06:53.106 --> 01:06:57.144
<i>and the roofs smelled
when it was just laid down.</i>

01:06:57.177 --> 01:06:59.413
<i>And the tar on the road.</i>

01:07:02.449 --> 01:07:06.053
<i>And the sweetness of summer.</i>

01:07:06.086 --> 01:07:11.425
<i>And the cold, cold days
at the end of February,</i>

01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:15.329
<i>and the joy of spring,
when everything was born again.</i>

01:07:20.233 --> 01:07:22.636
<i>And everything was born again.</i>

01:08:11.918 --> 01:08:15.755
<i>Stan?</i>

01:08:29.301 --> 01:08:30.470
Oh, hey, Terry.

01:08:30.502 --> 01:08:31.238
Good morning, Stan.

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:32.104
Morning.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.673
Sorry, I, um, you know
to be honest,

01:08:33.707 --> 01:08:35.276
I was just getting
out of the shower.

01:08:35.309 --> 01:08:38.145
Look, I apologize for, uh,
coming over unannounced,

01:08:38.179 --> 01:08:40.881
but, uh, I tried calling like...
like a bunch of times.

01:08:40.913 --> 01:08:41.615
My cell?

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:42.649
Yeah, damn thing.

01:08:42.682 --> 01:08:43.484
Yeah.

01:08:43.515 --> 01:08:45.452
Straight to voicemail
every time.

01:08:48.287 --> 01:08:49.788
Yeah, I haven't seen you
in a while.

01:08:49.823 --> 01:08:51.692
I've been meaning to make
more calls,

01:08:51.725 --> 01:08:53.493
but, uh, I'm kind of in
the middle of a transition

01:08:53.527 --> 01:08:54.493
to be honest.

01:08:54.528 --> 01:08:55.563
Yeah, no kidding.

01:08:55.595 --> 01:08:57.296
No kidding.

01:08:57.331 --> 01:09:01.402
Thinking about, uh,
selling the site,

01:09:01.435 --> 01:09:05.773
which, I'm not sure, you know,
one way or the other.

01:09:05.805 --> 01:09:11.411
It goes against, uh, Peachland
Voice's credo, you know.

01:09:12.377 --> 01:09:16.884
And here we are.

01:09:16.917 --> 01:09:22.490
Stan, are you okay?

01:09:22.523 --> 01:09:26.761
I... I ask because, um,
well, I don't want to pry,

01:09:26.792 --> 01:09:28.694
but we got this, um,
phone call.

01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:29.563
Call?

01:09:29.595 --> 01:09:33.466
Uh, it was, um,
well the police called.

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.702
They were looking for you,

01:09:34.734 --> 01:09:35.969
they said your family
was looking for you,

01:09:36.002 --> 01:09:42.309
they said you were...
uh, uh, distressed.

01:09:42.341 --> 01:09:51.685
I really, um, I... I don't
want to pry, but um...

01:09:54.787 --> 01:09:56.856
Do you smoke?

01:09:56.890 --> 01:10:00.294
Uh... Yeah. Sometimes.

01:10:00.327 --> 01:10:03.530
Very carefully.

01:10:15.475 --> 01:10:17.744
Oh shit.

01:10:20.546 --> 01:10:23.984
Smoking fire chief,
that's not a good look, eh?

01:10:33.894 --> 01:10:41.435
So... I... I was having a
tough time, and, uh, anyhow.

01:10:41.467 --> 01:10:44.037
I'm doing better now.

01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:47.007
Well, you look better.

01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:52.579
Hell, we all looked like death
back in the thick of it, right?

01:10:54.047 --> 01:10:55.282
So listen, Stan.

01:10:55.315 --> 01:10:59.886
The... the reason that I'm here
is I tried calling like I said,

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.490
and then, well you got that
email from the city council.

01:11:03.524 --> 01:11:04.592
Email?

01:11:04.625 --> 01:11:05.725
Oh, the, um... yeah.

01:11:05.759 --> 01:11:06.694
About the breakfast.

01:11:06.726 --> 01:11:08.362
About the breakfast.

01:11:08.395 --> 01:11:12.667
The breakfast this morning.

01:11:12.699 --> 01:11:13.967
I... I can't do that, Terry.

01:11:14.001 --> 01:11:18.038
Look, I knew you were
gonna say that,

01:11:18.072 --> 01:11:20.940
but um, whatever it is, it...
it can wait.

01:11:20.974 --> 01:11:25.613
Just... put it on pause,
it'll be worth your while,

01:11:25.645 --> 01:11:27.614
I promise you.

01:11:31.484 --> 01:11:34.087
Just, I don't know,
maybe a different shirt,

01:11:34.121 --> 01:11:39.793
and away we go.

01:11:39.827 --> 01:11:40.795
Yeah?

01:11:40.828 --> 01:11:44.098
<i>Yet these heroes and heroines
were real.</i>

01:11:44.131 --> 01:11:49.470
Grit, gristle and all, and yes,
a lot of spunk.

01:11:49.502 --> 01:11:51.371
I'll keep my remarks
like the latest fashion,

01:11:51.404 --> 01:11:52.972
long enough to cover
the subject,

01:11:53.006 --> 01:11:54.608
but short enough
to be interesting.

01:11:56.443 --> 01:11:58.346
Thank you.

01:11:58.378 --> 01:12:02.015
It was Peachland's greatest time
of need.

01:12:02.048 --> 01:12:04.984
<i>Hundreds displaced,
homes threatened,</i>

01:12:05.018 --> 01:12:09.724
<i>emergency personnel working
countless overtime hours.</i>

01:12:09.756 --> 01:12:16.029
In one fell swoop, a wildfire
changed our lives forever.

01:12:16.063 --> 01:12:18.399
On behalf of the City
of Peachland,

01:12:18.431 --> 01:12:21.969
I would like to acknowledge
the following people.

01:12:22.002 --> 01:12:26.006
First and foremost,
the Peachland fire crew.

01:12:26.038 --> 01:12:30.110
<i>Chief Terry Rocklyn,
Allan Varrett,</i>

01:12:30.144 --> 01:12:35.649
<i>Chris Stephens, Ray Herrin,
and Peggy Spallack.</i>

01:12:35.681 --> 01:12:37.684
<i>And all the rest of them.</i>

01:12:41.087 --> 01:12:44.925
<i>You banded together
and shone a light,</i>

01:12:44.957 --> 01:12:47.560
fending away the ever
encroaching danger

01:12:47.594 --> 01:12:50.730
and clearing a path,
a safe path,

01:12:50.764 --> 01:12:54.534
to those in their darkest times.

01:12:54.568 --> 01:12:57.538
Thank you.

01:12:57.570 --> 01:12:59.573
Oh no, don't.
Sorry, wait for Benjamin.

01:12:59.605 --> 01:13:00.608
Go. Yep.

01:13:05.479 --> 01:13:08.048
Um, thank you, Lorraine.

01:13:08.081 --> 01:13:11.685
Well, uh, I guess it's usually
a really good thing

01:13:11.717 --> 01:13:14.587
when you find out you're going
to be working from home.

01:13:16.023 --> 01:13:17.190
Unless you're a firefighter.

01:13:17.224 --> 01:13:18.859
The mic went off!

01:13:18.891 --> 01:13:22.496
<i>Uh... I say, unless
you're a firefighter.</i>

01:13:27.234 --> 01:13:29.537
Uh... great. Thanks Ben.

01:13:29.569 --> 01:13:30.570
Hello, hello?

01:13:30.604 --> 01:13:32.206
Hey, there, that's much better.

01:13:32.238 --> 01:13:36.176
Uh, well, listen, all I really
wanted to say about the fire

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:41.681
was, um, it was the most
challenging experience

01:13:41.715 --> 01:13:44.217
of my entire career,
and, uh, well,

01:13:44.251 --> 01:13:46.220
I hope to god it stays
that way.

01:13:46.252 --> 01:13:48.889
And, uh, for my brothers
and sisters,

01:13:48.921 --> 01:13:56.696
all I can say is, uh, I am, uh,
I am just so proud of you.

01:13:56.729 --> 01:13:58.731
<i>Thank you, Terry.</i>

01:14:03.103 --> 01:14:05.806
I don't have my mic, so
I'll use my theatre training.

our mission statement ha...
is and always has been

01:15:04.297 --> 01:15:09.036
to provide quality service in
partnership with our community.

01:15:09.069 --> 01:15:13.007

not only as a world-class

but as a cherished member
of our community.

01:15:52.345 --> 01:15:59.118
<i>Our fanatic sleuth and informer.
The glue that held us together.</i>

01:15:59.152 --> 01:16:00.119

<i>the distinction for citizen

but given the circumstances,

01:16:08.095 --> 01:16:13.266
we unanimously decided that
this was the appropriate venue.

01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:16.604
So, Ladies and Gentlemen,

01:16:16.636 --> 01:16:20.840

A few words?

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.224
Um... Uh, thank...
thank you, thank you.

01:16:37.256 --> 01:16:40.360
Um, I don't, you know,
speak in-

01:16:40.394 --> 01:16:43.963
public speaking, I don't do,
um, obviously, you know,

01:16:43.997 --> 01:16:49.670
because of what I do for
a living, uh, it's clear...

01:16:50.002 --> 01:16:59.646
Um... I love communicating,
and, uh, I... I love Peachland.

01:17:00.314 --> 01:17:02.750
Oh, thank you, thank you...

01:17:02.783 --> 01:17:04.218
Thank you, Stan.

01:17:09.456 --> 01:17:12.326
<i>For you, Stan, our resident

<i>we would like to award you

<i>Gift certificates

Wow.

01:17:28.007 --> 01:17:30.210
<i>And now of course, you all know
me as a bit of a troublemaker</i>

01:17:30.243 --> 01:17:32.813
and a rascal, so I would
be remiss not to mention

01:17:32.845 --> 01:17:34.981
the glaring irony here,

01:17:35.015 --> 01:17:38.018
that being that the reward
for being

01:17:38.051 --> 01:17:41.388
<i>an integral part of the
community is an opportunity</i>

01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:43.090
<i>to leave it for the weekend.</i>

01:17:45.891 --> 01:17:47.360
<i>Oh, such fun.</i>

01:17:47.394 --> 01:17:49.762
<i>Okay, enjoy your breakfast,
and, uh,</i>

01:17:49.796 --> 01:17:51.699
<i>we'll see you in a minute.</i>

01:18:06.313 --> 01:18:08.882
Stan. Stan.

01:18:08.914 --> 01:18:10.384
Over here for the picture.

01:18:10.417 --> 01:18:11.919
I'm... I'm, I'm okay.

01:18:11.952 --> 01:18:13.119
<i>Citizen of the year award, Stan.</i>

01:18:13.153 --> 01:18:14.454
I'm just reading the thing.

01:18:14.488 --> 01:18:16.289
<i>Stan, in the picture, please.</i>

01:18:16.323 --> 01:18:18.826
Stan! What the hell?

01:18:18.859 --> 01:18:21.929
Uh, ooh, sorry.

01:18:21.962 --> 01:18:24.298
<i>Come on.</i>

01:18:24.331 --> 01:18:25.466
There you go.

01:18:25.498 --> 01:18:26.500
All right.

01:18:26.533 --> 01:18:30.104
Could I get Stan
in the middle?

01:18:30.136 --> 01:18:31.271
Perfect.

01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:34.807
And can we get everybody
to cozy up just a little bit?

01:18:34.841 --> 01:18:38.045
All right, if we could all say
"Peachland."

01:18:38.078 --> 01:18:39.747
Peachland!

01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:54.293
<i>I still see the fire coming up
over the ridge.</i>

01:18:54.327 --> 01:18:56.463
<i>Our house should've burned.</i>

01:18:56.496 --> 01:18:57.498
<i>This block.</i>

01:19:01.268 --> 01:19:03.503
<i>The whole town.</i>

01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:09.476
<i>Maybe it still will, somehow.</i>

01:19:12.511 --> 01:19:16.082
You'd think we'd have heard
something by now.

01:19:16.115 --> 01:19:19.920
You know, considering that
they have our phones,

01:19:19.953 --> 01:19:22.189
<i>our computers, your possessions.</i>

01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:24.992
<i>These are, these are
things we own.</i>

01:19:25.024 --> 01:19:28.362
Well, they're building a case,
I think.

01:19:28.395 --> 01:19:33.400
Or, maybe one day soon,
there'll be a knock at the door,

01:19:33.432 --> 01:19:36.203
and we'll be free to go on
with our lives.

01:19:36.235 --> 01:19:37.503
You'll be free to get better.

01:19:37.537 --> 01:19:41.208
I can't even think about it.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:44.411
It helps, sometimes.

01:19:44.444 --> 01:19:47.381
Yeah, people ask me, how...
how are things going,

01:19:47.413 --> 01:19:50.850
and I lie.

01:19:50.884 --> 01:19:55.322
Ask about you, I lie.

01:19:55.354 --> 01:19:57.957
So if I can do it for them,
why can't I do it for myself?

01:19:57.990 --> 01:20:01.228
Just every now and again.

01:20:04.331 --> 01:20:08.601
<i>Yeah, there it is.
First colours.</i>

01:20:08.635 --> 01:20:10.436
<i>It's like when we were young,
remember?</i>

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:13.440
<i>We used to stay up all night
waiting for the sun to come up.</i>

01:20:13.472 --> 01:20:15.108
Ooh, the lighting storm.

01:20:16.909 --> 01:20:18.144
<i>Oh, the lightning storm.</i>

01:20:18.177 --> 01:20:19.412
In the tent.

01:20:19.445 --> 01:20:20.413
Shut up!

01:20:20.447 --> 01:20:22.449
<i>You said, wait for it...</i>

01:20:22.481 --> 01:20:23.449
Oh...

01:20:23.483 --> 01:20:27.520
Uh, I believe I'm destined
for something big.

01:20:52.479 --> 01:20:54.615
That's where it all started.

01:20:56.181 --> 01:20:58.217
Past says we don't get
those days back.

01:20:58.251 --> 01:20:59.519
But you know, you're right.

01:20:59.551 --> 01:21:03.422
I used to daydream about
being rich and famous.

01:21:03.456 --> 01:21:05.158
Well, you know,
there's a purity there.

01:21:05.190 --> 01:21:06.225
Oh, please.

01:21:06.259 --> 01:21:08.328
There is, that... that feeling
of being destined

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.563
for something big.

01:21:09.595 --> 01:21:19.272
I mean, not rich and famous,
but just good.

01:21:19.305 --> 01:21:20.506
I think you are.

01:21:20.539 --> 01:21:23.243
Mishu.

01:21:23.275 --> 01:21:28.447
You are. You're good.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.417
I feel so weird.

01:21:31.451 --> 01:21:32.685
It's so new.

01:21:32.719 --> 01:21:39.192
I... I can focus, I have energy,
I can sleep through the night.

01:21:39.225 --> 01:21:44.164
Yeah, I've noticed something.

01:21:44.197 --> 01:21:46.166
It... it's in your eyes,
the way you look at me,

01:21:46.198 --> 01:21:50.103
it's like you're really, well...

01:21:50.136 --> 01:21:52.139
You looking at me.

01:21:52.171 --> 01:21:55.074
I can't explain it.

01:21:55.108 --> 01:21:57.277
I don't know what I want
to believe, or what's better.

01:21:58.377 --> 01:21:59.278
Medication's working,

01:21:59.313 --> 01:22:02.181
or I'm actually getting better
on my own.

01:22:02.215 --> 01:22:04.952
Why does it have to be
one or the other?

01:22:04.984 --> 01:22:09.956
Can't it be many things
at once?

01:22:15.261 --> 01:22:16.196
Hello?

01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:17.597
<i>Gail, it's Marjorie.</i>

"child porn."</i>

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:36.182

What? No, no, that...
that won't work, that won't.

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.471
No, I won't lift a finger
for less than 50,000.

01:30:44.503 --> 01:30:49.175
No, and also, by the way, I am,
I am unreachable tonight.

01:30:49.207 --> 01:30:50.476
Rrrr.

01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:51.543
Shh, no.

01:30:51.577 --> 01:30:52.545
Huh?

01:30:52.578 --> 01:30:54.547
The board? No, I don't care...

01:30:54.579 --> 01:30:56.114
Me?

01:30:56.148 --> 01:30:58.885
I'm not, I'm not afraid

I'm not afraid to make mad
sick money.

01:31:01.621 --> 01:31:04.023
You... you tell the board that
unless they can make

cloning happen, in... in which
case we... we are all set.

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:10.530
Well, I don't care.

01:31:10.563 --> 01:31:13.166
Yeah. At the board,
you tell the board,

01:31:13.198 --> 01:31:18.237
you tell the board that
I, um... that...

01:31:30.181 --> 01:31:31.184
Oh.

01:31:37.722 --> 01:31:41.827
Paid vacations.

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:43.863
Leasing cars.

01:31:47.033 --> 01:31:52.038
Quiet family dinners.

01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:55.541
Making sandwiches
for the road.

01:31:55.574 --> 01:31:57.609
Boys nights.

01:31:57.643 --> 01:31:59.979
Buying an electric guitar.

01:32:00.011 --> 01:32:04.283
Going to the library
for how-to's.

01:32:04.317 --> 01:32:07.587
Not being able to buy
the couch.

01:32:14.793 --> 01:32:18.197
Seeing your face.

01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:22.167
Your face.

01:32:22.201 --> 01:32:27.140
Seeing you.

01:32:27.172 --> 01:32:33.679
Thinking I see you,
and then seeing you.

01:32:33.712 --> 01:32:35.213
<i>Reading you Yates.</i>

01:32:36.381 --> 01:32:39.152
<i>Reading you...</i>

01:32:41.252 --> 01:32:43.121
<i>Lurking for the raise,
pining for the raise,</i>

01:32:43.154 --> 01:32:45.657
<i>hoping to get the raise,
not getting the raise.</i>

01:32:45.690 --> 01:32:50.195
<i>Getting laid off.</i>

01:32:53.131 --> 01:32:56.935
<i>Your hair.</i>

01:32:56.969 --> 01:33:05.377
<i>Your shoulders.</i>

01:33:05.411 --> 01:33:08.815
<i>The golden years.</i>

01:33:08.847 --> 01:33:10.115
<i>New retirement home,</i>

01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:12.251
<i>and how much it reminds
you of summer camp.</i>

01:33:12.283 --> 01:33:15.821
<i>And suddenly you're the funniest
guy in the room.</i>

01:33:15.854 --> 01:33:17.723
<i>And watching your brothers</i>

01:33:17.756 --> 01:33:22.928
and your sisters and
all your friends die.

01:33:22.962 --> 01:33:29.669
And then dying by yourself.

01:33:29.702 --> 01:33:32.838
Not by yourself.

01:33:32.872 --> 01:33:39.045
With your wife by your side.

01:33:39.078 --> 01:33:45.685
One last kiss.

01:33:45.717 --> 01:33:51.256
It passes so quickly,
and it's gone.

01:33:51.289 --> 01:33:55.662
We can't get those days back.

01:33:55.694 --> 01:33:57.262
<i>The accused is charged</i>

01:33:57.296 --> 01:33:58.798

01:34:30.195 --> 01:34:36.769
That would be an offence
under the code.

01:34:36.801 --> 01:34:40.305
<i>The inclusion of written material
in the offence of the making,</i>

01:34:40.338 --> 01:34:45.077
<i>distributing and possession
of child pornography,</i>

01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:48.014
<i>does not amount
to thought control.</i>

01:34:48.046 --> 01:34:51.317
<i>Though the events recounted in
the chat log did not take place,</i>

01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:54.387
<i>evidence suggests that
the cognitive distortions</i>

01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:58.990
<i>of pedophiles are reinforced
by such materials,</i>

01:34:59.024 --> 01:35:03.229
<i>and that written pornography
fuels the sexual fantasies</i>

01:35:03.261 --> 01:35:09.034
<i>of pedophiles, and could
incite them to offend.</i>

01:35:10.036 --> 01:35:14.907
<i>The stories describe criminal
sexual encounters</i>

01:35:14.939 --> 01:35:18.810
<i>between adults and children,</i>

01:35:18.844 --> 01:35:23.815
<i>that include episodes of
fellatio, cunnilingus,</i>

01:35:23.849 --> 01:35:26.953
<i>and intercourse.</i>

01:35:26.985 --> 01:35:29.956
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
a fair warning.</i>

01:35:29.988 --> 01:35:35.327
<i>This material is disturbing.</i>

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.764
<i>As you'll recall, Hurst
wrote about an encounter</i>

01:35:37.796 --> 01:35:39.865
<i>with a neighbour's
daughter saying</i>

01:35:39.899 --> 01:35:42.268
<i>"I can't help but notice the
shape of her body</i>

01:35:42.301 --> 01:35:44.237
<i>"underneath her clothes.</i>

01:35:44.270 --> 01:35:46.038
<i>"And now I can't stop thinking</i>

01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:51.176
<i>"about what her naked body
must look like.</i>

01:35:51.210 --> 01:35:54.012
<i>"Would there be something
about it that would excite me?</i>

01:35:54.046 --> 01:35:58.784
<i>"I can't rid myself
of this question.</i>

01:35:58.818 --> 01:36:00.552
<i>"So I ask her if she needs
to have a shower,</i>

01:36:00.586 --> 01:36:05.423
<i>"and if it would be okay
for me to watch.</i>

01:36:05.457 --> 01:36:07.327
<i>"She says yes."</i>

01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:15.334
<i>"She takes off her clothes
for me.</i>

01:36:15.367 --> 01:36:18.837
<i>"As she slips off her panties,
I catch a glimpse</i>

01:36:18.871 --> 01:36:24.010
<i>"of her budding breasts
and light pink nipples.</i>

01:36:24.042 --> 01:36:26.045
<i>"Her tiny ass."</i>

01:36:28.514 --> 01:36:34.453
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this could be your neighbour.</i>

01:36:36.354 --> 01:36:46.264
<i>It goes on, only getting more
dark and depraved.</i>

01:36:46.297 --> 01:36:48.099
<i>"I can feel my heartbeat
in my throat,</i>

01:36:48.132 --> 01:36:50.269
<i>"but I can't make sense
of these feelings,</i>

01:36:50.301 --> 01:36:54.606
<i>"so I reach out and touch
her milky skin.</i>

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.376
<i>"A gentle touch..."</i>

01:37:36.916 --> 01:37:42.587
<i>It passes so quickly,
and it's gone.</i>

01:37:42.621 --> 01:37:48.560
<i>And we can't get those
days back.</i>

01:37:48.594 --> 01:37:51.663
Things were about to get
so much better for us, I swear.

01:37:51.697 --> 01:37:54.166
It was this close.

01:38:10.416 --> 01:38:11.951
You okay?

01:39:12.825 --> 01:39:17.825
