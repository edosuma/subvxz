01:25.375 --> 01:31.375
My father's family name being Pirrip,
and my Christian name Phillip,

01:31.458 --> 01:33.625
my infant tongue
could make of both names

01:33.708 --> 01:38.125
nothing longer or more explicit than Pip.

01:38.208 --> 01:42.791
So I called myself Pip,
and came to be called Pip.

03:08.833 --> 03:11.125
Keep still or I'll cut your throat.

03:11.208 --> 03:13.583
No, sir, no...

03:13.666 --> 03:15.708
Tell us your name. Quick.

03:15.791 --> 03:18.000
Pip. Pip, sir.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.750
Show us where you live.
Point out the place.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.208
There, sir. There.

03:41.791 --> 03:45.041
- Now, where's your mother?
- There, sir.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.500
No, sir. There, sir.

03:47.583 --> 03:51.541
Also Georgiana.
That's my mother.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.375
Ah. Is that your father
along with your mother?

03:54.458 --> 03:57.125
Yes, sir, him, too.
Late of this parish.

03:57.208 --> 03:58.666
Ah.

03:59.500 --> 04:04.208
Who d'you live with? Supposing you're
let to live which I ain't decided yet.

04:04.291 --> 04:08.750
With my sister, sir. Mrs. Joe Gargery,
wife of Joe Gargery the blacksmith.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.583
Blacksmith, eh?

04:13.833 --> 04:16.083
Now look here,
do you know what a file is?

04:16.166 --> 04:17.333
Yes, sir.

04:17.416 --> 04:19.458
- You know what wittles is?
- Yes, sir. Food, sir.

04:19.541 --> 04:24.041
Then you get me a file and wittles
or I'll have your heart and liver out.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.166
If you'll kindly let me keep upright, sir,

04:26.250 --> 04:29.541
perhaps I shouldn't be sick
and perhaps I could attend more.

04:29.625 --> 04:33.416
Bring that file and them wittles to me
here tomorrow morning, early.

04:33.500 --> 04:37.041
- Yes, sir.
- Don't say a word of having seen me.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.666
- No, sir.
- If you do,

04:38.750 --> 04:42.916
your heart and liver will be tore out
and roasted and ate.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.166
There's a young man hid with me, and
in comparison with him, I'm an angel!

04:49.250 --> 04:53.041
That young man has a secret way
of getting at a boy, and at his liver.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.583
A boy may lock his door,
may be warm in bed,

04:55.666 --> 05:01.041
but that young man will softly creep
his way to him and tear him open!

05:01.125 --> 05:03.333
Say heaven strike you dead if you don't.

05:03.416 --> 05:06.041
Heaven strike me dead if I don't.

05:07.625 --> 05:10.291
Now you know what you've promised,
young man.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.458
- Get off home.
- Good night, sir.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.208
Hello, Joe.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.916
Mrs. Joe's been out a dozen times
looking for you, Pip.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.875
She's out again now,
making it a baker's dozen.

06:01.958 --> 06:05.708
- Is she?
- And she's got Tickler with her, Pip.

06:05.791 --> 06:10.666
She got up, she made a grab at Tickler
and she rampaged out, Pip.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.291
- She rampaged out.
- If I find Pip...

06:13.375 --> 06:18.958
She's a-coming. Get behind the door,
old chap, and get the towel betwixt you.

06:20.041 --> 06:23.291
You young monkey!

06:25.958 --> 06:27.416
Ow!

06:29.416 --> 06:32.083
Now then, where have you been?

06:32.166 --> 06:34.833
- Only the churchyard.
- Churchyard, indeed.

06:34.916 --> 06:38.083
You'd have been there long ago
if it hadn't been for me.

06:38.166 --> 06:41.833
It's bad enough being a blacksmith's wife
without being your mother.

06:41.916 --> 06:47.250
Churchyard, indeed! You'll have me in
there on the rampage with my poor heart.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.625
Get to the table. Both of you.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.833
Listen.

07:01.333 --> 07:05.500
- Was that great guns, Joe?
- Yes, there's another convict off.

07:05.583 --> 07:09.041
- What does that mean?
- Oh, escaped, escaped.

07:09.125 --> 07:12.625
There was one escaped last night.
They fired a warning of him.

07:12.708 --> 07:14.750
This must be a second one.

07:14.833 --> 07:19.375
- Where does the firing come from?
- Ask no questions, you'll be told no lies!

07:23.333 --> 07:27.083
Mrs. Joe, I should like to know,
if you wouldn't much mind,

07:27.166 --> 07:30.916
- where the firing comes from.
- From the hulks, of course.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.666
Oh, hulks. And, please, what's hulks?

07:34.750 --> 07:38.791
That's the way with him. Answer him
one question and he'll ask a dozen.

07:38.875 --> 07:42.541
Hulks are prison ships,
right across the marshes.

07:42.625 --> 07:46.791
I wonder who's put in prison ships
and why they're put in there.

07:46.875 --> 07:51.041
People are put into prison ships
because they murder, forge and rob,

07:51.125 --> 07:53.541
and do all sorts of bad things.

07:53.625 --> 07:57.583
And they always start
by asking too many questions.

07:57.666 --> 08:00.833
Now get on with your supper
and get off to bed.

08:26.083 --> 08:31.041
A boy may be warm in bed,
he may pull the clothes over his head,

08:31.125 --> 08:36.500
but that young man will softly creep
his way to him and tear him open!

08:36.582 --> 08:38.041
No!

08:49.458 --> 08:52.333
Wake up, Mrs. Joe!

08:52.416 --> 08:54.500
Wake up!

08:59.083 --> 09:01.583
Mrs. Joe, wake up.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.708
You're a thief, Pip.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.666
You're a wicked thief, Pip.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.916
You'll be sent the hulks.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.208
A boy with somebody else's brandy!

10:03.291 --> 10:06.750
- With somebody else's file.
- With somebody else's pork pie.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.625
Stop him!

10:09.708 --> 10:12.333
Hello, young thief.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.208
I couldn't help it, sir.

11:35.583 --> 11:37.041
Sir?

11:42.041 --> 11:44.125
- You brought no one with you?
- No, sir.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.291
- No one followed you?
- No, sir.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.166
- What's in the bottle, boy?
- Brandy.

11:53.791 --> 11:55.833
I think you've got the ague, sir.

11:57.833 --> 11:59.916
I'm much of your opinion, boy.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.791
- I'm glad you enjoy it.
- Hm?

12:08.875 --> 12:12.833
- I said, I'm glad you enjoy it.
- Thank you, boy, I do.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.291
Aren't you going
to leave any of it for him?

12:16.375 --> 12:20.208
- Him? Who's him?
- The young man you spoke of.

12:20.291 --> 12:24.333
Oh, him. He don't want no food.

12:24.416 --> 12:26.500
He looked as if he did.

12:27.958 --> 12:30.458
Looked? When?

12:30.541 --> 12:32.916
- Just now.
- Where?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.083
Over there.

12:35.916 --> 12:38.416
Did you notice anything about him?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.666
He had a big scar on his face.

12:40.750 --> 12:43.416
- Not here?
- Yes, there.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.916
Give us hold of that file, boy.

12:55.458 --> 12:59.333
If you're not wanting me, sir,
we have company for dinner

12:59.416 --> 13:02.666
- and my sister will be up early.
- Thank you, boy. Thank you.

13:06.541 --> 13:10.666
This boy ought to be truly grateful,
ma'am, for this princely dinner.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.291
Do you hear Uncle Pumblechook?
Be grateful.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.541
- Why are the young never grateful?
- Naturally vicious.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.916
- True, true.
- Now, to finish with...

13:19.000 --> 13:23.583
I want you all to taste a delicious gift
from Uncle Pumblechook.

13:23.666 --> 13:26.875
It's a pie. A savory pork pie.

13:26.958 --> 13:29.625
A savory pork pie!

13:29.708 --> 13:33.833
Let's have a cut of this pie, Mrs. Joe,
and we'll try to do it justice.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.041
Clean plates. Cold.

13:37.125 --> 13:40.125
I always say
a bit of savory pork pie

13:40.208 --> 13:44.541
will lay atop of anything you may care
to mention and do no harm.

13:44.625 --> 13:48.000
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, sir.

13:48.083 --> 13:52.083
I should think not. Enjoying yourself
with your elders and betters,

13:52.166 --> 13:55.333
improving yourself
with their conversation.

13:58.291 --> 14:01.000
Now then, son.
Where do you think you're off to?

14:01.750 --> 14:06.000
Oh, excuse me, but I'm on a chase
in the name of the King.

14:06.083 --> 14:09.583
- I want the blacksmith.
- And what might you want him for?

14:09.666 --> 14:12.416
Missus, speaking for myself
I should reply,

14:12.500 --> 14:15.458
for the honor
of his fine wife's acquaintance.

14:15.541 --> 14:18.166
Speaking for the King I answer,
a little job done.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.875
Blacksmith, we've had an accident
with these.

14:20.958 --> 14:24.625
They're wanted for immediate service.
Will you throw your eye over them?

14:24.708 --> 14:26.375
- Convicts, Sergeant?
- Aye, two.

14:26.458 --> 14:29.916
Have you seen 'em?
Heavens, no!

14:30.000 --> 14:33.666
We haven't seen them.
Well, we'll find 'em.

14:40.791 --> 14:42.875
Platoon, fall in!

14:44.833 --> 14:47.958
Platoon, attention!

14:48.041 --> 14:50.125
Shoulder, up!

14:51.625 --> 14:53.708
Left turn!

14:54.500 --> 14:56.583
Platoon, march!

15:05.708 --> 15:08.916
If that boy comes back
with his head blown to bits,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.416
don't look to me to put it together again!

15:26.958 --> 15:29.666
I hope we don't find them, Joe.

15:29.750 --> 15:33.916
I'd give a shilling if they had
cut and run, Pip. Come on.

15:48.291 --> 15:51.166
Help! Convicts escaping!

15:51.250 --> 15:52.666
- Come on!
- Help!

15:52.750 --> 15:54.208
This way!

15:55.083 --> 15:56.541
Help!

15:59.875 --> 16:01.958
Officers, quickly!

16:04.250 --> 16:07.250
This way! This way!

16:09.000 --> 16:13.833
Help! Help! Quickly, this way!

16:47.416 --> 16:48.791
Let go!

16:48.875 --> 16:52.208
Don't forget, I took him.
I gave him up to you.

16:52.291 --> 16:55.416
- Don't forget that.
- He tried to murder me.

16:55.500 --> 16:59.458
Me, tried to murder him? I kept him
from getting off these marshes.

16:59.541 --> 17:02.875
I could've got clear,
then I discovered he was here.

17:02.958 --> 17:05.415
And let him go free to make
a fool of me again?

17:07.540 --> 17:09.625
Let me go.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.333
Make ready!

17:12.415 --> 17:14.000
Present!

17:14.083 --> 17:15.540
Fire!

17:24.375 --> 17:25.833
Hand.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.708
You're expected on board.

17:36.791 --> 17:38.625
Come on.

17:38.708 --> 17:40.791
Light those torches.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.291
Get aboard, you.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.541
Torch bearers!

18:03.375 --> 18:06.916
I wish to say something
respecting this escape.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.375
It may prevent some persons
laying under suspicion along'a me.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.666
What is it?

18:11.750 --> 18:15.416
I took some food from the blacksmith
near the village over yonder.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.000
It was a dram of liquor and a pie.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.250
Have you missed
such an article as a pie?

18:22.333 --> 18:25.208
Well, my wife did
the very moment you came in.

18:25.291 --> 18:29.083
Oh, so you're the blacksmith, are you?

18:29.166 --> 18:32.833
Then I'm sorry to say I've eat your pie.

18:32.916 --> 18:36.458
Oh, you're welcome to it
as far as ever it were mine.

18:36.541 --> 18:40.416
We don't know what you've done
but we wouldn't have you starve for it,

18:40.500 --> 18:42.791
poor miserable fellow creature,
would us, Pip?

18:42.875 --> 18:44.958
Give way, you.

18:47.291 --> 18:49.375
Cast off there!

19:02.791 --> 19:04.875
It was a year later...

19:36.458 --> 19:40.458
Now, if that boy ain't grateful this day,
he never will be.

19:40.541 --> 19:44.250
- It's to be hoped he won't be pampered.
- Not by Miss Havisham, ma'am.

19:44.333 --> 19:47.333
- She knows better.
- Do you know who Miss Havisham is?

19:47.416 --> 19:49.083
- Yes.
- Who?

19:49.166 --> 19:51.791
She's the strange lady in the large house.

19:51.875 --> 19:54.291
- But she's mad, ain't she?
- She may be mad,

19:54.375 --> 19:56.458
but she's rich enough
to make his fortune.

19:56.541 --> 20:00.791
She wants him to play there. And he'd
better play there or else I'll work him.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.458
Well, I wonder how she comes
to know our Pip.

20:04.541 --> 20:06.750
Oh, Lor-a-mussy me!

20:06.833 --> 20:10.500
Here I stand talking to mere mooncalves,
Uncle Pumblechook waiting,

20:10.583 --> 20:14.000
and that boy grimed with dirt
from his head to his feet.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.541
Ow!

20:59.208 --> 21:01.791
Ring the bell, boy!

21:10.958 --> 21:13.250
- What name?
- Pumblechook.

21:13.333 --> 21:15.583
Quite right.

21:17.166 --> 21:19.916
- Can you read the time, boy?
- Yes, sir.

21:21.625 --> 21:24.791
- A quarter past three.
- Punctual to the minute.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.958
Let it be a lesson to you.

21:36.416 --> 21:38.750
This is Pip.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.916
So this is Pip, is it?

21:41.875 --> 21:44.166
Come in, Pip.

21:44.250 --> 21:48.041
- Do you wish to see Miss Havisham?
- If Miss Havisham wishes to see me.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.208
Ah, but you see, she doesn't.

21:51.833 --> 21:53.916
Come along, boy.

22:06.708 --> 22:10.250
Your clock's stopped, Miss.
It should say a quarter past three.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.416
Don't loiter, boy!

22:22.875 --> 22:24.958
Come along, boy!

22:28.083 --> 22:30.166
Take your hat off!

22:57.541 --> 22:59.625
This door, boy.

23:01.666 --> 23:05.416
- After you, Miss.
- Don't be silly. I'm not going in.

23:13.166 --> 23:14.625
Come in.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.541
Who is it?

23:25.625 --> 23:27.791
- Pip, ma'am.
- Pip?

23:27.875 --> 23:30.625
Mr. Pumblechook's boy. Come to play.

23:32.041 --> 23:35.541
Come nearer.
Let me look at you.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.583
Come close.

23:54.083 --> 23:56.166
Look at me.

23:58.250 --> 24:03.625
You're not afraid of a woman who has
never seen the sun since you were born?

24:04.416 --> 24:06.458
No.

24:06.541 --> 24:11.291
Do you know what I touch... here?

24:12.333 --> 24:14.791
- Your heart.
- Broken!

24:28.833 --> 24:31.541
I sometimes have sick fancies.

24:34.083 --> 24:38.125
And I have a fancy
I should like to see someone play.

24:39.583 --> 24:41.041
Play.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.708
Play.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.250
Estella, come here.

24:55.541 --> 24:58.541
Your own, one day, my dear.

24:59.375 --> 25:01.458
And you will use it well.

25:03.583 --> 25:08.250
Let me see you play cards
with this boy.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.333
With this boy?

25:10.416 --> 25:13.958
But he is a common laboring boy.
And look at his boots.

25:17.958 --> 25:19.583
Well...

25:19.666 --> 25:21.875
you can break his heart.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.291
What do you play, boy?

25:27.583 --> 25:30.916
- Only beggar my neighbor.
- Beggar him.

25:33.625 --> 25:36.500
- Four for the ace.
- One for a jack.

25:36.583 --> 25:40.375
He calls the knaves "jacks", this boy.

25:40.458 --> 25:43.291
And what coarse hands he has.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.333
You stupid, clumsy, laboring boy!

25:47.416 --> 25:50.041
She says many hard things of you,

25:50.958 --> 25:53.875
but you say nothing of her.

25:53.958 --> 25:56.041
What do you think of her?

25:58.166 --> 26:00.083
I don't like to say.

26:00.166 --> 26:03.625
Tell me... in my ear.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.500
I think she is very proud.

26:08.583 --> 26:11.625
Anything else?

26:11.708 --> 26:14.041
I think she's very pretty.

26:14.125 --> 26:16.333
Anything else?

26:16.416 --> 26:18.500
I think she is very insulting.

26:18.583 --> 26:20.666
Anything else?

26:20.750 --> 26:22.833
I think I should like to go home now.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.875
And never see her again,

26:25.958 --> 26:28.750
though she is so pretty?

26:31.416 --> 26:34.666
I'm not sure
that I wouldn't like to see her again,

26:34.750 --> 26:37.708
but I think I'd like to go home now.

26:37.791 --> 26:40.125
You shall go home soon.
Play the game out.

26:43.791 --> 26:45.875
Wait here, boy.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.875
- Why don't you cry?
- Because I don't want to.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.833
You do. You've been crying
and you're near crying now.

27:12.541 --> 27:16.750
Long after I had gone to bed that
night, I thought of Estella,

27:16.833 --> 27:21.666
and how common she would
consider Joe, a mere blacksmith.

27:21.750 --> 27:24.875
I thought how he and my sister
were sitting in the kitchen,

27:24.958 --> 27:28.375
and how Miss Havisham
and Estella never sat in a kitchen,

27:28.458 --> 27:32.625
but were far above
the level of such common things.

27:33.625 --> 27:35.708
The following week...

27:46.375 --> 27:48.458
You're to come this way today, boy.

28:03.791 --> 28:07.541
Well, I'm sure! What next?
The idea!

28:12.166 --> 28:14.083
Well?

28:14.166 --> 28:17.083
- Well, Miss?
- Am I pretty?

28:18.458 --> 28:20.708
Yes, I think you are very pretty.

28:20.791 --> 28:23.041
Am I insulting?

28:25.625 --> 28:28.375
No, not so much so as you were
last time.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.458
- Not so much so?
- No.

28:32.541 --> 28:35.250
There! Take that,
you coarse little monster.

28:36.875 --> 28:39.958
- What do you think of me now?
- I shan't tell you.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.708
Because you're going to tell upstairs,
is that it?

28:42.791 --> 28:45.541
No, that's not it.

28:45.625 --> 28:48.125
Why don't you cry again,
you little wretch?

28:49.125 --> 28:52.000
I'll never cry for you again.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.125
In there, boy.

29:29.291 --> 29:30.791
Oh!

29:30.875 --> 29:33.791
So the days have worn away, have they?

29:33.875 --> 29:36.458
- Yes, ma'am. Today...
- There, there.

29:37.375 --> 29:41.208
I know nothing of days of the week,
nothing of weeks of the year.

29:43.458 --> 29:46.333
Do you know what that is?

29:46.416 --> 29:49.916
- There?
- I can't guess what it is, ma'am.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.333
It's a great cake. A bride-cake.

29:54.916 --> 29:56.583
Mine.

29:58.791 --> 30:01.583
On this day of the year,
long before you were born,

30:01.666 --> 30:04.000
this heap of decay was brought here.

30:04.875 --> 30:06.958
It and I have worn away together.

30:08.208 --> 30:10.291
Mice have gnawed at it.

30:11.583 --> 30:15.666
And sharper teeth
than teeth of mice have gnawed at me.

30:16.791 --> 30:18.625
There, there.

30:18.708 --> 30:21.083
Walk me.

30:21.166 --> 30:23.250
Walk me! Walk me!

30:28.625 --> 30:29.875
Dear Miss Havisham.

30:29.958 --> 30:32.250
Good morning, Miss Havisham.

30:32.875 --> 30:37.083
- How well you look.
- I do not look well, Sarah Pocket.

30:37.166 --> 30:39.250
I am yellow skin and bone.

30:40.416 --> 30:43.208
Those, Pip, are my relations,

30:43.291 --> 30:45.583
the Pockets.

30:45.666 --> 30:49.125
They are very particularly
interested in my health.

30:51.958 --> 30:54.083
So, once a year, on my birthday,

30:54.166 --> 30:56.750
I summon them to visit me.

30:56.833 --> 30:59.541
- Many ha...
- There!

30:59.625 --> 31:03.083
Pip, my dear,
run into the garden and play.

31:03.166 --> 31:06.291
Estella will tell you when to come back.

31:06.375 --> 31:08.458
Yes, ma'am.

31:17.791 --> 31:19.875
Hello, young fellow!

31:21.166 --> 31:23.708
- Hello.
- Who gave you leave to prowl about?

31:23.791 --> 31:25.458
Miss Estella.

31:26.875 --> 31:28.666
Come and fight.

31:28.750 --> 31:32.833
Oh, stop a minute, though. I ought
to give you a reason for fighting, too.

31:37.208 --> 31:39.291
There it is. Come on.

31:41.166 --> 31:46.083
- Are you satisfied with the ground?
- Quite satisfied, thank you.

31:46.166 --> 31:47.625
Good.

32:10.708 --> 32:13.583
- Ready?
- Ready.

32:33.791 --> 32:35.875
That means you've won.

32:47.458 --> 32:49.208
Can I help you?

32:49.291 --> 32:51.375
No, thankee. I'm quite all right.

32:52.750 --> 32:55.541
- Good afternoon, then.
- Same to you.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.708
Boy!

33:00.583 --> 33:02.041
Boy!

33:06.666 --> 33:08.000
Yes, Miss?

33:17.125 --> 33:19.458
You may kiss me, if you like.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.416
Now you are to go home.

33:42.708 --> 33:45.958
Three months later,
my sister became ill

33:46.041 --> 33:49.083
and was laid to rest
in the churchyard on the marshes.

33:53.041 --> 33:57.041
The occasion was marked for me,
not so much by the passing of Mrs. Joe,

33:57.125 --> 33:59.791
as by the arrival of Biddy.

34:10.458 --> 34:13.625
Very soon she became
a trusted friend to both of us

34:13.708 --> 34:16.000
and a blessing to the household.

34:19.291 --> 34:22.166
Biddy, I want you to help me.

34:22.250 --> 34:24.291
Don't I help you, Pip?

34:24.375 --> 34:28.041
Oh, yes, you help me a lot
with my letters and figures,

34:28.125 --> 34:30.250
but this is a secret.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.000
Oh, what is it?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.208
- Biddy.
- Yes?

34:37.250 --> 34:41.250
- Biddy, I want to be a gentleman.
- A gentleman?

34:41.333 --> 34:45.541
Oh, I wouldn't if I was you, Pip.
I don't think it would answer.

34:45.625 --> 34:50.291
Biddy, I have a particular reason
for wanting to be a gentleman.

34:50.375 --> 34:54.791
Well, you know best, Pip, but don't
you think you're happy as you are?

34:56.583 --> 34:59.875
I'm not happy as I am.
I'm coarse and common.

34:59.958 --> 35:03.666
Coarse and common,
are you, Pip? Who said so?

35:03.750 --> 35:07.083
The beautiful young lady at
Miss Havisham's.

35:07.166 --> 35:09.583
And I want to be a gentleman
on her account.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.916
- Whom have we here?
- A boy.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.458
- A boy of the neighborhood, hey?
- Yes, sir.

35:32.541 --> 35:35.541
- How do you come here?
- Miss Havisham sent for me, sir.

35:35.625 --> 35:39.208
Well, behave yourself.
I have a pretty large experience of boys

35:39.291 --> 35:41.166
and you're a bad lot of fellows.

35:41.250 --> 35:44.125
- Mind you behave yourself.
- Yes, sir.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.208
- Take this in there, boy.
- Yes, Miss.

35:50.291 --> 35:53.291
From this moment,
I entered upon the occupation

35:53.375 --> 35:55.875
of pushing Miss Havisham in her chair.

35:57.333 --> 35:59.833
As we began to be more
used to one another,

35:59.916 --> 36:03.166
Miss Havisham talked more to me
and asked me such questions

36:03.250 --> 36:07.000
as what I'd learnt
and what I was going to be.

36:07.083 --> 36:11.583
Estella was always there,
and always let me in and out,

36:11.666 --> 36:13.958
but never told me
I might kiss her again.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.041
Sometimes she would
coldly tolerate me.

36:18.125 --> 36:20.583
Other times,
she told me energetically...

36:20.666 --> 36:22.750
I hate you!

36:23.458 --> 36:27.083
My admiration of her
knew no bounds

36:27.166 --> 36:29.375
and scarce a night went by

36:29.458 --> 36:33.750
without falling asleep with the image
of her pretty face before my eyes.

36:35.916 --> 36:37.375
One day...

36:43.333 --> 36:46.208
Does she grow
prettier and prettier, Pip?

36:46.291 --> 36:47.875
Yes, Miss Havisham.

36:47.958 --> 36:50.041
There, there.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.208
That's all till next time.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.083
Miss Havisham, I can't come next time.

37:00.166 --> 37:03.458
This is sad news, Pip. Why not?

37:03.541 --> 37:06.375
Tomorrow is my birthday
and I'm fourteen.

37:06.458 --> 37:10.583
And you start your apprenticeship
with the blacksmith, do you not?

37:10.666 --> 37:12.708
Yes, Miss Havisham.

37:12.791 --> 37:15.166
Why so glum, Pip?

37:15.250 --> 37:18.375
Are you not excited
by your new venture?

37:18.458 --> 37:22.916
I used to think I would be,
but I'm not now.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.958
Pip...

37:25.041 --> 37:29.166
here are some golden sovereigns.

37:29.250 --> 37:32.750
- A gift from me.
- Thank you, Miss Havisham.

37:32.833 --> 37:36.541
Do with them what you please.
You've earned them well.

37:36.625 --> 37:37.875
Thank you.

37:37.958 --> 37:40.833
Come and see me on your next birthday.

37:40.916 --> 37:44.625
- Yes, Miss Havisham.
- Estella, show him out.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.416
Goodbye, Miss Havisham.

37:53.291 --> 37:54.750
Goodbye, Pip.

38:00.375 --> 38:03.708
You'd better say goodbye to me
because I'm going away too.

38:05.833 --> 38:07.708
- Going away?
- Yes.

38:07.791 --> 38:10.916
I'm going to France
to be educated for a lady.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.791
- Educated for a lady?
- Yes.

38:16.625 --> 38:20.125
Well? Aren't you sorry I'm going?

38:21.333 --> 38:24.458
Yes, Estella. I'm very sorry.

38:25.291 --> 38:28.666
I wish I knew when
you were coming back. I wish...

38:28.750 --> 38:31.208
What do you wish?

38:31.291 --> 38:33.375
I wish I could kiss you goodbye.

38:49.125 --> 38:51.583
My boyhood had ended

38:51.666 --> 38:53.958
and my life as a blacksmith began.

38:56.166 --> 38:59.791
It was in the sixth year
of my apprenticeship,

38:59.875 --> 39:01.958
and it was a Friday night.

39:09.708 --> 39:14.208
Are you the blacksmith
by name Joseph, or Joe, Gargery?

39:14.291 --> 39:15.291
Yes, sir.

39:15.375 --> 39:19.625
Have you an apprentice commonly
known as Pip? Is he here?

39:19.708 --> 39:21.916
I'm Pip, sir.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.333
- So you are Pip?
- Yes, sir.

39:24.416 --> 39:28.208
My name is Jaggers.
I'm a lawyer in London.

39:28.291 --> 39:31.041
I wish to have
a private conference with you two.

39:31.125 --> 39:33.208
We'd better go into the house.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.541
Now, Joseph Gargery,

39:37.625 --> 39:42.000
I am the bearer of an offer
to relieve you of this young fellow.

39:42.083 --> 39:46.375
You would not object to cancel
his apprenticeship for his own good?

39:46.458 --> 39:49.916
- You would want nothing?
- Heaven forbid I should want anything

39:50.000 --> 39:52.208
for not standing in Pip's way.

39:52.291 --> 39:56.458
Very well, then.
I come now to this young fellow.

39:56.541 --> 40:00.875
And my communication to him
is that he has great expectations.

40:02.208 --> 40:04.125
I am instructed to communicate to him

40:04.208 --> 40:06.458
that he will come into
a handsome property.

40:06.541 --> 40:11.125
Further, that it is at the desire of
the present possessor of that property

40:11.208 --> 40:15.625
that he shall be removed from his
present sphere of life and from this place

40:15.708 --> 40:20.500
and be brought up as befits a young
gentleman of great expectations.

40:21.583 --> 40:24.208
Now, Mr. Pip, you are to understand first

40:24.291 --> 40:27.791
that it is at the request of the person
from whom I take my instructions

40:27.875 --> 40:30.625
that you always bear the name of Pip.

40:32.083 --> 40:35.083
If you have any objection,
now is the time to mention it.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.291
I have no objection.

40:37.375 --> 40:39.416
I should think not, indeed.

40:39.500 --> 40:41.708
Secondly, Mr. Pip,

40:41.791 --> 40:45.583
you are to understand that the name
of the person who is your benefactor

40:45.666 --> 40:49.875
is to remain a profound secret
until that person chooses to reveal it.

40:51.291 --> 40:54.166
If you have any suspicion
whom that person might be,

40:54.250 --> 40:57.500
keep that suspicion
within your own breast.

40:57.583 --> 41:00.708
If you have any objection,
now is the time to mention it.

41:00.791 --> 41:04.291
- Speak out.
- I have no objection.

41:04.375 --> 41:08.125
And now, Mr. Pip,
kindly consider me your guardian.

41:08.208 --> 41:10.166
I thank you, sir.

41:10.250 --> 41:14.541
I'm well paid for my services,
otherwise I shouldn't render them.

41:14.625 --> 41:17.791
I have arranged for you
to go to London in a week's time.

41:17.875 --> 41:19.958
You will need some new clothes.

41:20.041 --> 41:23.125
They should not be working clothes.

41:25.375 --> 41:26.958
Twenty guineas.

41:28.875 --> 41:32.291
Well, Joseph Gargery?
You look dumbfounded.

41:32.375 --> 41:33.500
I am.

41:34.791 --> 41:37.000
Then good night, Mr. Gargery.

41:45.416 --> 41:47.500
- Good night, Pip.
- Good night, sir.

41:52.958 --> 41:54.375
Pip!

41:54.458 --> 41:59.875
A young gentleman of great
expectations!

42:01.583 --> 42:03.666
Biddy! Biddy!

42:28.625 --> 42:30.708
Pip!

42:33.958 --> 42:36.041
This is a very gay figure, Pip.

42:37.166 --> 42:38.875
I start for London tomorrow.

42:38.958 --> 42:42.000
I thought you would not mind
my taking leave of you.

42:42.083 --> 42:44.125
Well?

42:44.208 --> 42:47.750
I've come into such good fortune
since I saw you last

42:47.833 --> 42:50.291
and I am so grateful for it.

42:51.083 --> 42:53.583
I've seen Mr. Jaggers, Pip.

42:53.666 --> 42:56.083
I've heard about it.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.958
- So you go tomorrow?
- Yes, Miss Havisham.

43:00.041 --> 43:03.875
And you are adopted by a rich person.

43:03.958 --> 43:07.625
- Not named?
- No, Miss Havisham.

43:07.708 --> 43:10.375
And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?

43:10.458 --> 43:12.541
Yes, Miss Havisham.

43:13.875 --> 43:16.375
- Is Estella...
- Abroad.

43:16.458 --> 43:18.750
Prettier than ever

43:18.833 --> 43:21.000
and admired by all who see her.

43:23.041 --> 43:25.666
And you too have
a promising career before you.

43:26.750 --> 43:28.833
Be good and deserve it, Pip.

43:30.083 --> 43:33.791
You will always keep
the name of Pip, you know.

43:33.875 --> 43:35.750
Yes, Miss Havisham.

43:36.833 --> 43:38.916
Goodbye, Pip.

44:07.583 --> 44:09.041
Well...

44:10.208 --> 44:11.458
Bye, Joe.

44:11.541 --> 44:13.958
God bless you, dear old Pip.
God bless you.

44:15.333 --> 44:17.416
- Bye, Biddy.
- Goodbye, Pip.

44:29.875 --> 44:32.458
One day I'll come
and see you in London, Pip,

44:32.541 --> 44:34.791
and then what larks, eh?

44:34.875 --> 44:37.208
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye, Joe.

44:37.291 --> 44:39.875
Goodbye, Pip, old chap.

45:37.291 --> 45:39.375
Hey, London.

46:27.041 --> 46:30.416
Ahem. Excuse me, please.
Is Mr. Jaggers at home?

46:30.500 --> 46:33.250
He is not. He's in court at present.

46:33.333 --> 46:36.041
- Am I addressing Mr. Pip?
- Yes, I'm Mr. Pip.

46:36.125 --> 46:39.500
Mr. Jaggers left word would you wait
in his room. This way, please.

46:39.583 --> 46:44.125
Couldn't say how long he might be
but he won't be longer than he can help.

46:47.375 --> 46:48.958
Go and wait outside, Mike.

46:49.041 --> 46:52.375
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Oh, certainly not.

46:55.083 --> 46:56.500
Oi!

46:57.916 --> 47:00.833
- Your first time in London, Mr. Pip?
- Yes, sir.

47:00.916 --> 47:03.333
I was new here once.
Rum to think of it now.

47:04.458 --> 47:06.833
- Whose likeness is that?
- That?

47:06.916 --> 47:10.791
This is our most famous client.
Got us a world of credit.

47:11.875 --> 47:14.291
This chap murdered his master.

47:14.375 --> 47:16.458
Didn't plan it badly.

47:17.875 --> 47:21.208
- Is it like him?
- Like him? It is him, you know.

47:21.291 --> 47:24.958
This cast was made in Newgate,
directly after he was taken down.

47:30.041 --> 47:32.583
Your man is on this afternoon.
Got the witness?

47:32.666 --> 47:34.708
- Yes, Mr. Jaggers.
- Wait here.

47:34.791 --> 47:36.250
- Mr. Pip's here.
- Good.

47:37.875 --> 47:41.500
Ah, so you've arrived safely, Mr. Pip.
Good morning.

47:41.583 --> 47:44.375
- Good morning, Mr. Jaggers.
- We can soon settle you.

47:44.458 --> 47:46.500
Wemmick, Mr. Pip's file.

47:46.583 --> 47:51.166
Wemmick will show you to Mr. Herbert
Pocket's rooms in Barnard's Inn,

47:51.250 --> 47:52.666
where you will live.

47:52.750 --> 47:54.625
Oh, sit down, Mr. Pip, sit down.

47:54.708 --> 47:58.083
Mr. Pocket can give you a good lead
as to the places in London

47:58.166 --> 48:01.416
with which you should become
acquainted. That is agreeable?

48:01.500 --> 48:04.166
- Yes, Mr. Jaggers.
- Next, money.

48:04.250 --> 48:07.916
Your allowance will be 拢250 per annum,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.416
which means that
you will draw from Wemmick

48:10.500 --> 48:14.041
the sum of 62 pounds,
10 shillings per quarter.

48:14.125 --> 48:16.583
A very handsome sum
of money too, I think.

48:16.666 --> 48:19.416
- You consider it so?
- How could I do otherwise?

48:19.500 --> 48:22.375
- But answer the question.
- Undoubtedly, Mr. Jaggers.

48:22.458 --> 48:23.708
Good.

48:23.791 --> 48:25.041
Get out!

48:29.458 --> 48:32.875
Here is a list of tradespeople
with whom you may run an account.

48:32.958 --> 48:35.458
- Take Mr. Pip to Barnard's Inn.
- Yes, sir.

48:35.541 --> 48:38.791
I shall check the bills
and pull you up if you get on too well.

48:38.875 --> 48:41.875
You'll go wrong somehow,
but that's no fault of mine.

48:41.958 --> 48:44.041
Goodbye and good luck, Mr. Pip. Mike!

48:47.541 --> 48:50.666
Mr. Wemmick, I don't quite know
what to make of Mr. Jaggers.

48:50.750 --> 48:52.958
He don't mean that you should know.

48:53.041 --> 48:55.791
Deep, that's what he is, as Australia.

48:55.875 --> 48:58.000
Who was that
he shouted at so fiercely?

48:58.083 --> 49:00.708
That was his housekeeper,
name of Molly.

49:00.791 --> 49:02.833
He got her off on a murder charge.

49:02.916 --> 49:05.208
Murder? Isn鈥檛 he frightened of her?

49:05.291 --> 49:09.125
Not him. When you come to see us again,
take a good look at her.

49:09.208 --> 49:12.875
- Shall I see anything uncommon?
- You'll see a wild beast tamed.

49:12.958 --> 49:15.041
Keep your eye on it.

49:20.166 --> 49:22.958
Here we are.
Mr. Pocket's on the first floor.

49:23.041 --> 49:25.333
- You don't want me any more?
- No, thank you.

49:25.416 --> 49:29.041
As I keep the cash,
we shall most likely meet pretty often.

49:29.125 --> 49:31.166
Very glad to make your acquaintance.

49:31.250 --> 49:32.833
- Good day.
- Good day, sir.

50:09.375 --> 50:10.416
Mr. Pip?

50:10.500 --> 50:11.875
Mr. Pocket?

50:11.958 --> 50:15.583
I'm extremely sorry, but the fact is
I've been out on your account,

50:15.666 --> 50:18.500
for I thought you might like a little fruit.

50:18.583 --> 50:22.458
- I went to Covent Garden market for it.
- Thank you. It's very nice of you.

50:23.958 --> 50:26.041
Can I take the parcels?

50:29.083 --> 50:31.166
It sticks, you know.

50:34.958 --> 50:37.041
Pray, come in.

50:37.541 --> 50:40.041
Now, this is the sitting room.

50:40.125 --> 50:42.250
Rather musty, but Barnard's is musty.

50:42.333 --> 50:44.666
I'm afraid I'm rather bare here.

50:44.750 --> 50:48.250
Now, that's my little bedroom.
And this is your room.

50:48.333 --> 50:49.791
Come in.

50:53.416 --> 50:56.916
- It's very nice.
- The furniture's specially hired.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.833
Dear me, you're holding the fruit
all this time. I feel quite ashamed.

51:00.916 --> 51:05.583
You'll be very quiet here and we'll be
alone, but I dare say we shan't fight.

51:05.666 --> 51:06.791
Fight?

51:06.875 --> 51:10.250
Fight! I knew I'd seen you
somewhere before.

51:10.333 --> 51:13.291
You're the pale young gentleman
from Miss Havisham's.

51:13.375 --> 51:16.458
Bless me! And you are the prowling boy.

51:16.541 --> 51:20.083
- The idea of it's being you!
- Well, the idea of it's being you!

51:21.083 --> 51:23.541
You've forgiven me
for knocking you about so?

51:23.625 --> 51:26.000
Of course.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.666
- You hadn't your good fortune then?
- No.

51:28.750 --> 51:31.166
- I was hoping for a good fortune then.
- Indeed?

51:31.250 --> 51:34.791
If Miss Havisham had liked me,
I should have been provided for,

51:34.875 --> 51:39.750
perhaps even engaged to Estella,
but I didn't care for her. She's a tartar.

51:39.833 --> 51:42.583
- Miss Havisham?
- I don't say no, but I meant Estella.

51:42.666 --> 51:45.875
You know she was adopted
and brought up by Miss Havisham

51:45.958 --> 51:48.375
to wreak revenge on all the male sex?

51:48.458 --> 51:52.041
Wreak revenge on all the male sex?
What revenge?

51:52.125 --> 51:55.333
- Heavens, I thought you knew.
- No.

51:55.416 --> 51:58.750
It's quite a story,
and shall be saved till dinnertime.

51:58.833 --> 52:01.541
- Shall I take your stick?
- Thank you.

52:01.625 --> 52:03.291
And your hat.

52:13.750 --> 52:15.875
- Herbert?
- Yes, my dear Pip.

52:15.958 --> 52:18.041
As I've been brought up a blacksmith,

52:18.125 --> 52:22.333
I'd take it as a kindness if you'd give me
a hint when I go wrong in my manners.

52:22.416 --> 52:24.833
With pleasure,
but you need very few hints.

52:24.916 --> 52:28.375
Thank you very much.
Please tell me more of Miss Havisham.

52:28.458 --> 52:29.625
Ah, yes!

52:29.708 --> 52:34.708
But let me point out that it's not
the custom to put the knife in the mouth.

52:34.791 --> 52:38.708
For fear of accidents.
It's as well to do as other people do.

52:38.791 --> 52:42.416
- I must apologize. Thank you.
- Not at all, I'm sure.

52:42.500 --> 52:48.000
Miss Havisham was an heiress
and was looked upon as a great match.

52:48.083 --> 52:51.416
Well, one day there appeared
upon the scene a certain man.

52:51.500 --> 52:54.875
I never saw him,
for this was 25 years ago.

52:54.958 --> 52:58.250
He pursued her closely
and professed to be devoted to her.

52:58.333 --> 53:01.041
She fell passionately in love with him,

53:01.125 --> 53:04.250
which brings me to the cruel part
of the story -

53:04.333 --> 53:06.666
merely breaking off to remark,
my dear Pip,

53:06.750 --> 53:10.291
that it's not necessary to fill
the mouth to its utmost capacity.

53:10.375 --> 53:15.208
- Oh, very sorry. I was so interested...
- Not at all, I'm sure.

53:15.291 --> 53:17.375
The marriage day was arranged,

53:17.458 --> 53:20.125
the wedding dresses bought,
the guests invited.

53:20.208 --> 53:23.541
The day came, but not the bridegroom.
He wrote a letter...

53:23.625 --> 53:26.541
Which she received
at 20 minutes to nine.

53:26.625 --> 53:30.041
- Exactly.
- So that's why she stopped the clocks.

53:30.125 --> 53:32.666
Yes! When she'd recovered
from a bad illness,

53:32.750 --> 53:35.666
she laid the whole place waste,
as you've seen it,

53:35.750 --> 53:38.500
and has never since
looked upon the light of day.

53:40.500 --> 53:41.875
Herbert,

53:41.958 --> 53:47.291
you said that Estella was not related to
Miss Havisham, but adopted.

53:47.375 --> 53:48.375
When?

53:48.458 --> 53:52.125
There's always been an Estella
since I've heard of a Miss Havisham.

53:52.208 --> 53:56.416
I know no more. So, Pip, all I know
of Miss Havisham, you know.

53:56.500 --> 53:59.833
Let's change to brighter prospects.
Let's drink to London.

53:59.916 --> 54:02.000
And a very happy future.

54:03.416 --> 54:06.333
To London and a very happy future!

54:14.875 --> 54:19.166
Two, three, four...
Now all together, Mr. Pip. That's right.

54:20.083 --> 54:23.083
That's better. Much better.

54:23.166 --> 54:25.083
Enjoy yourself.

54:43.625 --> 54:44.666
Ready?

54:46.000 --> 54:47.041
Ready.

54:56.250 --> 54:57.291
Forgive me, Herbert.

55:00.166 --> 55:03.875
Carry on, Pip, carry on.

55:03.958 --> 55:08.333
So if I could buy some new furniture
and perhaps one or two other things,

55:08.416 --> 55:11.125
I think I could be quite
at home at Barnard's Inn.

55:11.208 --> 55:13.291
Go it! I knew you'd get on.

55:14.625 --> 55:17.041
How much do you want?

55:17.125 --> 55:19.208
- Twenty pounds?
- Wemmick!

55:41.750 --> 55:45.500
Well, Pip, I should say you were at home.

55:57.708 --> 56:00.000
- Herbert?
- Yes?

56:00.083 --> 56:02.250
We've done very badly.

56:02.333 --> 56:04.916
Very badly.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.083
Thank heaven for my birthday.

56:17.208 --> 56:20.500
- Good morning, Mr. Pip.
- Morning.

56:20.583 --> 56:23.166
- Congratulations, Mr. Pip.
- Thank you, Mr. Wemmick.

56:23.250 --> 56:25.250
Come in.

56:26.541 --> 56:28.791
- Mr. Pip, sir.
- Come in.

56:28.875 --> 56:30.666
21, eh, Pip?

56:30.750 --> 56:32.708
I must call you "Mr. Pip" today.

56:32.791 --> 56:35.041
- Congratulations, Mr. Pip.
- Thank you, Mr. Jaggers.

56:35.125 --> 56:36.583
Sit down.

56:53.166 --> 56:56.083
Now, my young friend,
I'm going to have a word with you.

56:56.166 --> 56:59.958
- If you please, sir.
- What are you living at the rate of?

57:02.541 --> 57:06.375
- At the rate of, Mr. Jaggers?
- The rate of.

57:07.833 --> 57:10.625
I'm... I'm afraid I am unable to answer.

57:10.708 --> 57:15.666
I thought so. Now, I've asked you a
question. Have you anything to ask me?

57:15.750 --> 57:20.875
Well, it would be a great relief to ask you
several, if it were not forbidden.

57:20.958 --> 57:23.250
Ask one.

57:23.333 --> 57:25.458
Is my benefactor
to be made known to me today?

57:25.541 --> 57:27.625
No. Ask another.

57:28.416 --> 57:33.583
Well, I was just wondering...
if I had anything to receive.

57:33.666 --> 57:36.166
I thought we should come to that.
Wemmick!

57:37.583 --> 57:42.125
You have been spending pretty freely of
late, and you are in debt, of course?

57:42.208 --> 57:43.916
I'm afraid I must say yes, sir.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.708
- You know you must say yes?
- Yes, sir.

57:46.791 --> 57:50.166
Wemmick,
hand Mr. Pip that piece of paper.

57:51.666 --> 57:54.250
Now, unfold it and tell me what it is.

58:01.583 --> 58:03.708
It is a bank note for 拢500.

58:03.791 --> 58:07.208
That is a bank note for 拢500.

58:07.291 --> 58:10.125
At the rate of that handsome
sum of money per annum,

58:10.208 --> 58:15.125
and at no higher rate, you are to live
until your benefactor appears.

58:15.208 --> 58:19.291
Will it... Will it still be
years hence, Mr. Jaggers?

58:19.375 --> 58:23.791
When that person discloses, you and
that person will settle your own affairs.

58:23.875 --> 58:25.916
My part of the business will cease.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.875
That's all I have to say.
Wemmick, show Mr. Pip out.

58:28.958 --> 58:30.000
Thank you, Mr. Jaggers.

58:31.166 --> 58:35.791
My dear Mr. Pip,
Mr. Gargery is going to London

58:35.875 --> 58:39.791
and would be glad, if you are agreeable,
to be allowed to see you.

58:39.875 --> 58:43.416
He would call
Tuesday morning at nine o'clock.

58:43.500 --> 58:49.000
We talk of you every night and wonder
what you are saying and doing.

58:49.083 --> 58:51.541
No more, dear Mr. Pip.

58:51.625 --> 58:54.916
From your ever obliged
and affectionate servant, Biddy.

58:55.916 --> 58:59.125
As I watched Joe that Tuesday
morning,

58:59.208 --> 59:01.875
dressed grotesquely in a new suit,

59:01.958 --> 59:06.291
let me confess, that if I could have
kept him away by paying money,

59:06.375 --> 59:09.000
I certainly would have paid money.

59:09.083 --> 59:11.375
In trying to become a gentleman,

59:11.458 --> 59:14.291
I had succeeded in becoming a snob.

59:28.958 --> 59:31.041
Joe. How are you, Joe?

59:33.000 --> 59:36.041
Pip. How are you, Pip?

59:37.083 --> 59:39.166
Come in, Joe.

59:45.458 --> 59:47.958
Well, Joe, I am glad to see you.

59:48.041 --> 59:52.541
Pip, dear old chap, you've growed and
you've swelled and you've gentle-folked

59:52.625 --> 59:55.833
as to be sure you're an honor
to your king and country.

59:55.916 --> 59:59.041
And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.
Give me your hat.

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:07.541
Oh, Herbert, this is Mr. Joe Gargery.
Joe, Mr. Herbert Pocket.

01:00:07.625 --> 01:00:11.083
- How do you do, Mr. Gargery?
- Your servant, sir.

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:13.708
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you kindly, sir.

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:27.916
Will you take tea or coffee, Mr. Gargery?

01:00:30.458 --> 01:00:32.833
Thank you kindly, sir.

01:00:32.916 --> 01:00:35.583
I'll take whichever
is most agreeable to yourself.

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:39.208
- What do you say to coffee?
- Thank you kindly, sir.

01:00:40.458 --> 01:00:43.666
Since you are so good
as to make choice of coffee,

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:49.416
I'll not run contrary to your opinions,
but don't you find that rather heating?

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.375
Say tea, then.

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:15.000
If Mr. Gargery will excuse me, I will go
down to fetch the morning's letters.

01:01:15.083 --> 01:01:17.166
Thank you kindly, sir.

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:23.375
- Us two being now alone, sir...
- Joe, how can you call me "sir"?

01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:25.958
Us two being now alone, Pip,

01:01:26.041 --> 01:01:30.333
I will mention what have led to me
having the present honor.

01:01:30.416 --> 01:01:33.375
Miss Havisham have recently sent
for me.

01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:34.625
Miss Havisham, Joe?

01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:37.625
"Would you tell Mr. Pip," she said,

01:01:37.708 --> 01:01:40.416
"that I wish to see him at once,

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.500
"for I have something
most particular to disclose to him."

01:01:44.583 --> 01:01:46.750
I see.

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:50.458
Well, I have now concluded, sir, and Pip,

01:01:50.541 --> 01:01:54.791
I wish you ever well and ever prospering
to a greater and greater height.

01:01:54.875 --> 01:01:56.875
But you are not going now, Joe?

01:01:56.958 --> 01:02:00.708
- Yes, I am.
- You'll be coming back to dinner?

01:02:00.791 --> 01:02:03.666
Oh, no, Pip, old chap.

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:08.208
You and me is not two figures
to be together in London.

01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:10.750
I'm wrong in these clothes, Pip.

01:02:10.833 --> 01:02:14.791
I'm wrong out of the forge
and out of the kitchen, off the marshes.

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:15.916
But Joe...

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.666
You won't find half so much fault
with me

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.916
if you think of me
as Joe the blacksmith.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.666
And so...

01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:29.041
God bless you, dear old Pip, old chap.

01:02:30.916 --> 01:02:33.000
God bless you.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:53.500
All that day, Joe's simple dignity
filled me with reproach.

01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:56.291
And next morning
I began the journey to our town,

01:02:56.375 --> 01:02:59.625
knowing that I should sleep that night
at the forge.

01:02:59.708 --> 01:03:02.541
But as the miles went by,

01:03:02.625 --> 01:03:04.833
I became less convinced of this,

01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:08.541
and invented reasons
and excuses for not doing so.

01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:11.625
Joe, Pip's here.

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:14.875
Oh, we didn't expect you, Pip.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:17.750
Pip, your bed's not ready.

01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:21.166
We thought for certain
you'd be staying in the town.

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:23.458
You must stay in the town.

01:03:23.541 --> 01:03:26.875
Gentlemen always stay
at the Blue Boar.

01:03:26.958 --> 01:03:29.250
Blue Boar, Rochester.

01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:34.083
All other swindlers upon earth
are nothing to the self-swindlers.

01:03:34.166 --> 01:03:37.625
And with such pretences
did I cheat myself.

01:03:37.708 --> 01:03:39.791
Surely a curious thing.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.458
Come in, Pip.

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:47.291
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Miss Havisham?

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:51.500
You kiss my hand as if I were a queen.

01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:53.041
Well?

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:58.458
I thought that you were so kind
as to wish to see me, Miss Havisham.

01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:01.000
Well?

01:04:04.958 --> 01:04:06.625
Estella!

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:13.500
Well, Pip?

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:16.041
Estella, this is an unexpected pleasure.

01:04:16.125 --> 01:04:18.375
I didn't think to find you here.

01:04:18.458 --> 01:04:22.375
You two must have a lot
to say to each other.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:26.500
Go out into the garden, both of you,
and walk and talk together.

01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:30.958
I must have been a strange little creature
to hide and watch you fight that day.

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:33.250
But I did and I enjoyed it very much.

01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:35.416
- You rewarded me very much.
- Did I?

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.708
Don't you remember?

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:40.250
I remember I entertained
a great objection to your opponent.

01:04:40.333 --> 01:04:43.083
I took it ill that he be brought here
to pester me.

01:04:43.166 --> 01:04:45.583
- He and I are great friends now.
- Are you?

01:04:45.666 --> 01:04:49.416
I imagine since your change of fortune
you have changed your companions.

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:51.583
Oh, yes, naturally.

01:04:52.666 --> 01:04:56.875
Remember the first time I came here?
The time you made me cry?

01:04:56.958 --> 01:04:59.541
Did I? I don't remember.

01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:02.000
Not remember you made me cry?

01:05:02.083 --> 01:05:05.625
You meant nothing to me,
why should I remember?

01:05:05.708 --> 01:05:08.291
You must know, Pip, I have no heart.

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:10.791
Perhaps that's why I have no memory.

01:05:10.875 --> 01:05:13.375
No one looking at you could believe that.

01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:17.750
Oh, I have a heart to be stabbed at
or shot at, but you know what I mean.

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:22.250
There's no sympathy there,
no softness, no sentiment.

01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:26.125
If we are to be thrown much together
you had better believe that at once.

01:05:26.208 --> 01:05:28.458
I can't believe it, Estella.

01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:31.458
Very well. It's said, at any rate.

01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:34.041
But remember
how I have been brought up

01:05:34.125 --> 01:05:36.208
and don't expect too much of me.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.583
Come, Pip.

01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:42.291
You shall not shed tears
for my cruelty today.

01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:45.375
We'll go just once more
round the garden and then go in.

01:05:45.458 --> 01:05:47.500
Miss Havisham will be expecting you
at your old post.

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:51.083
Is she beautiful,

01:05:51.166 --> 01:05:53.666
graceful, well-grown?

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:57.083
- Do you admire her, Pip?
- Everyone must who sees her.

01:05:57.166 --> 01:06:01.875
She is going to London soon
and you shall meet her there.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:05.791
I shall be the happiest man in London,
Miss Havisham.

01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:08.125
Love her.

01:06:08.208 --> 01:06:12.375
If she favors you, love her.

01:06:12.458 --> 01:06:16.500
If she tears your heart
to pieces, love her.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:20.333
I adopted her to be loved.
I developed her into...

01:06:22.916 --> 01:06:25.666
As punctual as ever, Jaggers.

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:27.791
As punctual as ever.

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:30.666
How do you do, Pip?
And what are you doing here?

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:35.333
Miss Havisham wished me
to see Estella, Mr. Jaggers.

01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:37.958
A fine young lady.

01:06:38.041 --> 01:06:40.291
Shall I give you a ride,
Miss Havisham?

01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:42.041
Once round?

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:44.666
A very fine young lady, Pip.

01:07:02.791 --> 01:07:04.250
- Estella!
- Pip.

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:07.000
How nice to see you, Estella.

01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:09.708
Miss Havisham taught me
there are two Richmonds,

01:07:09.791 --> 01:07:12.916
one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire.
Mine is the Surrey Richmond.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.375
The distance is ten miles and
you are to take me there. My purse.

01:07:16.458 --> 01:07:18.291
- No.
- No, take it.

01:07:18.375 --> 01:07:20.625
We are not free to follow
our own devices.

01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:25.041
The carriage is ordered for half
an hour from now and tea is ordered.

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:28.666
- Does that please, m'lady?
- The tea will please her greatly.

01:07:29.541 --> 01:07:31.666
Why are you going to Richmond?

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:34.000
I am going to live, at a great expense,

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:38.375
with a lady there who has the power
of taking me about and introducing me,

01:07:38.458 --> 01:07:41.583
and showing people to me,
and showing me to people.

01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:45.541
You'll have a gay time and be admired.
You must look forward to that.

01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:47.708
It's part of Miss Havisham's plan.

01:07:47.791 --> 01:07:50.833
I shan't take pleasure in events
which I don't shape,

01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:53.916
but I shall be beautiful and gay,
I shall be obedient

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.458
and I shall write regularly of my gaiety.

01:07:56.541 --> 01:08:00.458
Will you always be part of
Miss Havisham's plan, Estella?

01:08:00.541 --> 01:08:03.416
Do you thrive with Mr. Pocket, Pip?

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.333
Yes, indeed.

01:08:05.416 --> 01:08:08.041
We've left Barnard's Inn
and moved to the Temple.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:09.375
Oh?

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:12.916
I live quite pleasantly there, at least...

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.416
At least?

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.625
As pleasantly as I could anywhere...

01:08:17.707 --> 01:08:19.750
away from you.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:36.375
All summer I saw a great deal
of Estella and I was very happy.

01:08:36.457 --> 01:08:39.750
Until I realized, somewhat
uncomfortably,

01:08:39.832 --> 01:08:41.916
that she had many admirers.

01:08:43.125 --> 01:08:45.166
It was not until the winter,

01:08:45.250 --> 01:08:49.416
that fate threw her in the way
of Bentley Drummle.

01:09:22.707 --> 01:09:25.207
- Are you tired, Estella?
- Rather, Pip.

01:09:26.082 --> 01:09:29.041
- You should be.
- Say rather I should not be,

01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:31.916
for I still have my letter
to Miss Havisham to write.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.916
Recounting tonight's triumph?
Surely a very poor one, Estella.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.832
I don't know what you mean.
Have there been any?

01:09:39.916 --> 01:09:43.957
- Lords, ladies and gentlemen!
- This is our dance, Estella.

01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:47.791
Pray take your places
for the next dance.

01:10:05.791 --> 01:10:07.833
Estella, look at Drummle.

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:10.083
He never takes his eyes off you.

01:10:10.166 --> 01:10:13.166
Why should I look at him?

01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:15.666
Is there anything I need to look at?

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:17.833
That's what I want to ask you.

01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:20.208
He's been hovering
about you for weeks.

01:10:21.791 --> 01:10:26.583
Moths and all sorts of ugly creatures
hover about a lighted candle.

01:10:26.666 --> 01:10:28.750
Can the candle help it?

01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:34.458
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:38.500
pray take your partners
for the Spanish polka.

01:11:01.208 --> 01:11:04.541
Everybody dislikes him,
you must know that.

01:11:04.625 --> 01:11:09.375
There's nothing to recommend him
but money and ridiculous ancestors.

01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:12.041
It makes me wretched
to see you encourage him.

01:11:12.125 --> 01:11:14.208
Does it?

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.541
You give him looks and smiles
such as you never give to me.

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:36.125
Do you want me then
to deceive and entrap you?

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:40.291
- Do you deceive and entrap him?
- Yes, and many others.

01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:42.458
All of them but you.

01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:41.375
- Who do you want?
- Mr. Pip.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.875
I am Mr. Pip.
What's your business?

01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:49.041
My business?

01:12:50.125 --> 01:12:55.000
Ah, yes, I'll explain
my business, by your leave.

01:12:55.666 --> 01:12:58.500
Do you... Do you wish to come in?

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.541
Yes, I wish to come in, master.

01:13:13.083 --> 01:13:15.500
Now perhaps you will explain your visit.

01:13:29.708 --> 01:13:34.083
It's disappointing after having looked
forward so distant and come so far.

01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:38.875
- Ah, but you're not to blame for that.
- What do you mean?

01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:41.041
I'll speak in half a minute.

01:13:41.666 --> 01:13:43.750
Give me half a minute, please.

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.416
There's no one nigh, is there?

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.583
Why do you ask that question?

01:13:57.875 --> 01:13:59.875
Ah, you're a game 'un.

01:13:59.958 --> 01:14:02.583
I'm glad you growed up a game 'un.

01:14:03.916 --> 01:14:07.208
Now I know who you are.
The churchyard.

01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:11.958
The churchyard on the marshes.
You're the convict I gave the food to.

01:14:14.541 --> 01:14:16.708
You acted nobly, my boy.

01:14:16.791 --> 01:14:19.375
Noble, Pip, and I've never forgot it.

01:14:20.166 --> 01:14:22.708
If you're grateful
for what I did as a child,

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:25.708
and you've come to thank me for it,
there's no need.

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:31.958
However, since you've found me out,
will you drink something before you go?

01:14:32.041 --> 01:14:36.208
Yes, I will drink, I thank you, afore I go.

01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:53.291
I hope you won't think that
I spoke harshly to you just now.

01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:56.708
I had no intention of doing it,
and I'm sorry for it if I did.

01:14:56.791 --> 01:14:58.875
I wish you well and happy.

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:05.291
How have you been living?

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:12.083
I've been a sheep farmer, away in
the new world, in New South Wales.

01:15:12.166 --> 01:15:15.500
- I hope you've done well.
- I've done wonderful well.

01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:18.375
- I'm famous for it.
- I'm very glad to hear it.

01:15:18.458 --> 01:15:20.583
I hoped to hear you say so, dear boy,

01:15:20.666 --> 01:15:24.375
but you've done well too, eh?

01:15:25.666 --> 01:15:27.750
Yes, I've done quite well.

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:35.625
May I make so bold as to ask
how you've done well

01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:39.875
since you and me was out
on those lone, shivering marshes?

01:15:40.583 --> 01:15:42.166
- How?
- How?

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:48.416
Yes, I've been chosen
to succeed to some property.

01:15:49.625 --> 01:15:52.958
Might a mere varmint ask what property?

01:15:53.041 --> 01:15:55.750
I don't know.

01:15:57.458 --> 01:16:00.541
Might a mere varmint ask
whose property?

01:16:04.083 --> 01:16:05.541
I don't know.

01:16:05.625 --> 01:16:09.791
Could I make a guess at your income
since you come of age?

01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:14.375
As to the first figure now. Five?

01:16:20.833 --> 01:16:23.000
Concerning a guardian.

01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:27.166
There ought to have been a guardian
or such like when you were a minor.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:30.250
Some lawyer, maybe?

01:16:30.333 --> 01:16:34.333
As to the first letter
of that lawyer's name now...

01:16:34.416 --> 01:16:36.916
would it be J?

01:16:38.166 --> 01:16:43.250
As the employer of that lawyer
whose name began with J,

01:16:43.333 --> 01:16:45.458
and might be Jaggers...

01:16:48.916 --> 01:16:51.666
I wrote from Portsmouth to a person
in London

01:16:51.750 --> 01:16:54.541
for particulars of your address.

01:16:54.625 --> 01:16:57.541
That person's name?

01:16:57.625 --> 01:17:00.291
Why, Wemmick!

01:17:04.583 --> 01:17:09.333
Yes, Pip, dear boy, I made a gentleman
of you. It was me what done it.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:14.250
I swore that time, that as sure as I earned
a guinea, that guinea would go to you.

01:17:14.333 --> 01:17:17.083
And that there hunted dog
what you kept life in

01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:21.166
got his head so high that he made
a gentleman. And Pip, you're him!

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:24.375
Why, I'm your second father Pip,
and you're my son.

01:17:25.333 --> 01:17:27.666
And how good-looking you've growed.

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:30.708
Ah, there's a pair
of bright eyes somewhere, eh?

01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:34.083
Isn鈥檛 there a pair of bright eyes
what you love the thoughts of?

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:37.250
They shall be yourn, dear boy,
if money can buy 'em.

01:17:37.333 --> 01:17:40.041
But didn't you never think
it might be me?

01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:43.000
No, never.

01:17:43.083 --> 01:17:46.000
Well, you see, it was me
and single-handed.

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:49.666
Never a soul in it but me own self
and Mr. Jaggers.

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:52.875
- Was there no one else?
- No. Who else should there be?

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:56.791
Well, where are you
going to put me, dear boy?

01:17:58.041 --> 01:18:01.250
- Put?
- To sleep.

01:18:03.041 --> 01:18:05.083
Who's that?

01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:09.666
Don't be alarmed. It's Mr. Pocket
who shares these rooms with me.

01:18:11.375 --> 01:18:13.458
Phew! What a night!

01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:19.833
Hello.

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:24.500
Herbert... something
very strange has happened.

01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:26.666
This is a visitor of mine.

01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:29.750
Take it in your right hand.

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:34.625
Say "Strike me dead on the spot
if I split in any way whatever."

01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:40.041
Strike me dead on the spot
if I split in any way whatever.

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:43.250
- Kiss it.
- Do as he says, Herbert.

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:49.833
Now, you're on oath.

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:56.916
Come in.

01:18:57.708 --> 01:18:59.791
Ah. You can go now, Molly.

01:19:00.791 --> 01:19:02.875
- Now, Pip, be careful.
- I will, sir.

01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:07.166
Don't commit yourself or anyone.
You understand me?

01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:09.916
- Mr. Jaggers...
- Don't tell me. I don't want to know.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.833
I'm not curious.

01:19:11.916 --> 01:19:15.250
I merely want to assure myself
that what I've been told is true.

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:17.916
Did you say told or informed?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.833
Told would seem to imply
verbal communication.

01:19:20.916 --> 01:19:25.916
You can't have verbal communication
with a man in New South Wales.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.083
- I will say informed.
- Good.

01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:32.125
I have been informed
by a person named Abel Magwitch

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:34.625
that he is my unknown benefactor.

01:19:34.708 --> 01:19:37.625
That is the man, in New South Wales.

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:41.541
- And only he?
- And only he.

01:19:43.125 --> 01:19:47.750
I'm not holding you responsible for
my mistakes and wrong conclusions,

01:19:47.833 --> 01:19:50.083
but I always supposed that
it was Miss Havisham.

01:19:50.166 --> 01:19:53.125
As you say, Pip,
I am not at all responsible for that.

01:19:53.208 --> 01:19:56.458
- Yet it looked so like it, sir.
- Not a particle of evidence.

01:19:56.541 --> 01:20:00.333
Take nothing on its looks,
take everything on evidence.

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:06.541
Well, I have nothing more to say.

01:20:06.625 --> 01:20:10.708
You should know that I communicated
with Magwitch in New South Wales

01:20:10.791 --> 01:20:15.500
and reminded him that if he returned
to this country it would be a felony,

01:20:15.583 --> 01:20:19.041
rendering himself liable
to the extreme penalty of the law.

01:20:20.125 --> 01:20:22.208
Take a look out of that window, Pip.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.125
That sort of thing happens every day.

01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:59.208
Magwitch has enemies here
who would not hesitate to inform on him.

01:20:59.833 --> 01:21:01.041
I see.

01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:03.708
But he has guided himself
by my caution, no doubt.

01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:06.208
No doubt.
If you will excuse me, sir.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.041
There's no other alternative.

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:22.750
He must leave the country
and I have to go with him.

01:21:22.833 --> 01:21:25.458
- Why?
- He has risked everything for me.

01:21:25.541 --> 01:21:29.833
- I can do no less than stand by him.
- What will you say to Estella?

01:21:29.916 --> 01:21:32.083
I am at a loss to know what to say to her.

01:21:32.166 --> 01:21:34.750
She'd never understand about him.

01:21:34.833 --> 01:21:36.916
But I must see her before I go.

01:21:56.666 --> 01:21:59.333
- Ah! Just come down?
- Yes.

01:21:59.416 --> 01:22:02.000
Beastly place,
your part of the country, I think.

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:07.000
I'm going out for a ride. I mean to explore
those marshes for amusement.

01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:12.458
Out-of-the-way villages there, curious
little public houses, smithies and that.

01:22:12.541 --> 01:22:16.208
Mr. Drummle, I don't find this
a very agreeable conversation.

01:22:16.291 --> 01:22:18.833
I'm sure you don't, but don't lose
your temper.

01:22:18.916 --> 01:22:21.875
- Haven't you lost enough?
- What do you mean?

01:22:21.958 --> 01:22:26.666
The lady is joining me later, so take
her horse to her house in an hour.

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:28.166
Very good, sir.

01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:32.291
And don't forget to tell the waiter
I'm going to dine with the lady.

01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:33.833
Aye, aye.

01:22:40.166 --> 01:22:41.625
Come in.

01:22:44.416 --> 01:22:47.125
What wind blows you here, Pip?

01:22:55.958 --> 01:22:58.791
I went to Richmond yesterday
to speak to Estella,

01:22:58.875 --> 01:23:02.416
and finding that some wind
had blown her here I followed.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:06.333
What I have to say to Estella
I will say before you in a few moments.

01:23:06.416 --> 01:23:09.833
It will not surprise you,
it will not displease you.

01:23:09.916 --> 01:23:13.166
I am as unhappy as you could ever
have meant me to be.

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.708
I have found out whom my patron is.

01:23:19.916 --> 01:23:21.833
It isn't a fortunate discovery,

01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:27.166
and is not likely ever to enrich me in
reputation, station, fortune, anything.

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:30.041
But there are reasons
why I can say no more of that.

01:23:30.125 --> 01:23:32.208
It is not my secret but another's.

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:36.041
It is not your secret
but another's. Well?

01:23:36.125 --> 01:23:40.375
When you first caused me
to be brought here, Miss Havisham,

01:23:40.458 --> 01:23:43.625
I suppose I really came here
as any other chance boy might,

01:23:43.708 --> 01:23:47.166
as a kind of servant to gratify a want
or a whim and to be paid for it.

01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:50.500
- Aye, Pip, you did.
- And that Mr. Jaggers was...

01:23:50.583 --> 01:23:53.208
Mr. Jaggers had nothing to do with it.

01:23:53.291 --> 01:23:57.333
His being my lawyer and the lawyer
of your patron was a coincidence.

01:23:57.416 --> 01:24:00.041
He holds the same relation
towards numbers of people.

01:24:00.125 --> 01:24:04.708
But when I fell into the mistake,
at least you led me on.

01:24:04.791 --> 01:24:09.375
- Yes, I let you go on.
- Was that kind?

01:24:09.458 --> 01:24:14.041
Who am I, for heaven's sake,
that I should be kind?

01:24:16.166 --> 01:24:18.250
Well, well, well. What else?

01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:27.458
Estella, I should have said this sooner
but for my long mistake

01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:31.208
which led me to believe that Miss
Havisham meant us for one another.

01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:35.875
I couldn't tell you of my real feelings
while you were not free to choose.

01:24:36.916 --> 01:24:41.166
But now I have to go away.
And I must say it before I go.

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:45.541
I love you, Estella.

01:24:45.625 --> 01:24:48.333
I've loved you ever since
I first saw you here.

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:53.666
Pip, I tried to warn you not to love me,
but you thought I didn't mean it.

01:24:54.583 --> 01:24:58.125
Isn鈥檛 it true that Bentley Drummle
is in town pursuing you?

01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:00.375
Quite true.

01:25:00.458 --> 01:25:02.958
That you encourage him
and ride out with him?

01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:05.333
And that he dines with you this very day?

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.041
Quite true.

01:25:08.125 --> 01:25:10.750
How can you fling yourself
at such a man?

01:25:10.833 --> 01:25:15.958
Should I fling myself at you, Pip, who
would sense that I bring nothing to you?

01:25:16.041 --> 01:25:18.333
But you cannot love him, Estella?

01:25:18.416 --> 01:25:20.708
What have I always told you?

01:25:20.791 --> 01:25:23.375
Do you still think
that I don't mean what I say?

01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:27.750
Estella, you...

01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:30.875
You would never marry him?

01:25:34.666 --> 01:25:38.333
Why not tell you the truth?
I am going to be married to him.

01:26:05.083 --> 01:26:09.833
Come, Pip. Don't be afraid
of my being a blessing to him.

01:26:09.916 --> 01:26:12.500
I shall not be that.

01:26:12.583 --> 01:26:14.666
Here is my hand.

01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:20.291
Let us part on this. You'll get me
out of your thoughts in a week.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.875
What have I done?

01:26:38.416 --> 01:26:40.500
What have I done?

01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:50.458
If you mean what have you done to me,
Miss Havisham, let me answer.

01:26:50.541 --> 01:26:54.833
Estella has been part of my existence
ever since I first came here,

01:26:54.916 --> 01:26:58.166
the rough, common boy
whose heart she wounded even then.

01:26:59.208 --> 01:27:01.875
She has been the embodiment
of every graceful fancy

01:27:01.958 --> 01:27:04.041
that my mind has ever known.

01:27:04.125 --> 01:27:08.125
To the last hour of my life
she will remain part of my character,

01:27:09.083 --> 01:27:11.916
part of the little good in me,
part of the evil.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.666
But you may dismiss me
from your mind and conscience.

01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:18.583
But Estella is a different case.

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:22.166
And if you can ever undo
any scrap of what you've done amiss,

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:25.500
in keeping part of her right nature
away from her,

01:27:25.583 --> 01:27:30.625
it will be better to do that than to bemoan
the past through a hundred years.

01:28:44.458 --> 01:28:50.750
Late that evening, I left the room
with the long table for the last time

01:28:50.833 --> 01:28:53.625
and started on my way back to London.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:29:01.250
- Mr. Pip, I believe. Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:29:02.166 --> 01:29:06.208
I have a note for you, sir.
The messenger said it's urgent.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.125
- Get me a cab off the stand.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:20.291 --> 01:29:23.000
- Morning. What's the trouble?
- You got my note then?

01:29:23.083 --> 01:29:25.416
- Yes, I came straight here.
- What have you done to your hands!

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.208
- I got them burnt. I'm very anxious...
- Everything's taken care of.

01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:32.416
Pray, come in.
You don't object to an aged parent?

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.666
- Oh, no, delighted.
- This is Mr. Pip, Aged P.

01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:39.750
And I wish you could hear his name.
Give him a nod, that's what he likes.

01:29:43.375 --> 01:29:46.916
You have made acquaintance
with my son at his office, I expect.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.541
- Yes.
- Nod away, if you please, like winking.

01:29:49.625 --> 01:29:51.666
Yes, yes.

01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:54.000
Yes, yes.

01:29:54.083 --> 01:29:57.875
I hear that my son is a wonderful hand
at his business, sir.

01:30:00.375 --> 01:30:03.625
You're as proud of me as punch,
ain't you, Aged P?

01:30:03.708 --> 01:30:06.625
There's a nod for you.
There's another one for you.

01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:14.166
Now, Mr. Pip and I have business
to discuss.

01:30:15.250 --> 01:30:17.000
Come and sit down.

01:30:17.083 --> 01:30:20.208
I want to offer an apology,
he doesn't have many pleasures.

01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:24.083
Just tip him a nod now and then
and he'll be as happy as a king.

01:30:24.166 --> 01:30:27.625
You'll appreciate I'm most anxious
to know what's happened.

01:30:27.708 --> 01:30:29.958
Of course. Now...

01:30:31.041 --> 01:30:33.375
I heard by chance yesterday morning

01:30:33.458 --> 01:30:37.416
that an old enemy of a certain convict,
whose name we needn't mention...

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.541
- Yes...
- ..have got wind of his being in England.

01:30:40.625 --> 01:30:43.250
So I went to the Temple and found Mr.
Herbert.

01:30:43.333 --> 01:30:46.750
I told him that if he was aware
of any such person,

01:30:46.833 --> 01:30:50.875
whose name we needn't mention,
being about your chambers,

01:30:50.958 --> 01:30:53.166
that he'd better get him out of the way.

01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:56.083
I also heard that you had been watched.

01:30:56.166 --> 01:30:58.791
- That I'd been watched?
- Yes.

01:31:01.083 --> 01:31:03.000
And might be watched again.

01:31:03.083 --> 01:31:07.541
So he had better get him out of the way
while you were out of the way.

01:31:07.625 --> 01:31:10.708
I see. He would be
greatly puzzled what to do.

01:31:10.791 --> 01:31:11.791
He was!

01:31:11.875 --> 01:31:16.875
But we've now moved him to a house
by the river, down Limehouse way.

01:31:16.958 --> 01:31:21.583
- I should like to join them at once.
- My advice is to wait till after dark,

01:31:21.666 --> 01:31:25.041
by which time, you see,
we can have those hands attended to.

01:31:49.125 --> 01:31:50.958
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

01:31:51.041 --> 01:31:54.208
- Thank you. Our supper, if you will.
- Very good, sir.

01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:56.375
- How is he?
- All's well.

01:32:02.833 --> 01:32:05.333
I'm a heavy grubber, dear boy,
always was.

01:32:05.416 --> 01:32:08.708
Are you sure you can rely on
Wemmick's judgment and sources?

01:32:08.791 --> 01:32:10.833
Aye, Wemmick knows.

01:32:10.916 --> 01:32:14.583
He spoke to me
of a particular enemy of yours.

01:32:14.666 --> 01:32:17.125
- Do you know who that might be?
- Aye.

01:32:17.208 --> 01:32:20.791
The man you saw fighting with me
on the marshes, with the scar.

01:32:20.875 --> 01:32:23.166
He turned informer on me
to save his skin.

01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:25.291
He'd do it again to see me hanged,

01:32:25.375 --> 01:32:28.875
but no sneaking rat like him's
going to make me leave, my boy.

01:32:28.958 --> 01:32:32.083
If you're worried, there's no need.
I'm coming with you.

01:32:32.166 --> 01:32:34.208
No!

01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:36.333
You're a game 'un.

01:32:36.416 --> 01:32:38.916
What a game 'un my boy's
turned out to be, eh?

01:32:42.458 --> 01:32:46.750
The following day,
I sent Herbert to make some enquiries.

01:32:46.833 --> 01:32:49.333
He found that the packet boat
for the continent

01:32:49.416 --> 01:32:52.750
left Gravesend Pier
at high tide every Thursday.

01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:58.916
I set myself to hire a boat.
It was soon done.

01:32:59.625 --> 01:33:03.125
I couldn't get rid of
the notion of being watched.

01:33:03.208 --> 01:33:06.833
How many undesigning persons
I suspected of watching me,

01:33:06.916 --> 01:33:09.000
it would be hard to calculate.

01:33:10.458 --> 01:33:13.250
I began to go out
as for training and practice,

01:33:13.333 --> 01:33:16.250
sometimes alone, sometimes with
Herbert.

01:33:17.083 --> 01:33:22.625
We were out in all weathers
and became familiar figures on the river.

01:33:24.083 --> 01:33:26.166
My burns were still very painful.

01:33:27.958 --> 01:33:31.833
We made it a practice that Herbert
should embark from the place

01:33:31.916 --> 01:33:34.833
nearest to the house
where our convict was hidden.

01:33:35.708 --> 01:33:40.541
As the hours of the tide changed,
we took to going further downriver.

01:33:41.625 --> 01:33:46.916
There, on the marshes,
we found a lone public house

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.750
where we decided to stay
on the night of our escape.

01:33:51.791 --> 01:33:56.625
And from a nearby buoy we timed
the passing of the packet boat.

01:34:08.375 --> 01:34:10.458
We chose this spot carefully.

01:34:11.583 --> 01:34:16.250
It was just above the point where
the steamer picked up the river pilot.

01:34:17.458 --> 01:34:19.791
The river pilot.

01:34:19.875 --> 01:34:21.958
Our river pilot.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:26.958
One day, Herbert bought
two steamship tickets

01:34:27.041 --> 01:34:29.125
and our plans were set.

01:36:13.291 --> 01:36:15.000
Boat ahoy!

01:36:21.416 --> 01:36:23.500
Ahoy there!

01:36:42.125 --> 01:36:44.250
- Tell me something.
- What, dear boy?

01:36:45.958 --> 01:36:48.791
What I did for you as a child
was such a small thing.

01:36:49.875 --> 01:36:52.875
Why have you done so much for me?

01:36:52.958 --> 01:36:55.625
I had a child of me own once, Pip.

01:36:55.708 --> 01:36:58.750
A little girl who I loved and lost.

01:36:58.833 --> 01:37:01.791
What happened to her?

01:37:02.833 --> 01:37:08.625
I don't know. It's a dark part of my life,
dear boy. Ain't worth telling.

01:37:08.708 --> 01:37:11.375
But when on those lone,
shivering marshes

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:14.583
a boy was kind to a half-starved convict,

01:37:15.458 --> 01:37:18.000
that boy took the place
of the child he had lost.

01:37:19.083 --> 01:37:21.166
Pull on your left.

01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:05.583
Here she comes!

01:40:00.291 --> 01:40:02.375
One, two.

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:05.583
One, two.

01:40:06.708 --> 01:40:11.750
One, two. One, two...

01:40:11.833 --> 01:40:14.541
One, two.

01:40:34.708 --> 01:40:38.333
You have an escaped convict there.
That's the man in the stern.

01:40:38.416 --> 01:40:41.583
I call upon him to surrender
and you to assist!

01:41:01.625 --> 01:41:02.666
Look out!

01:41:03.708 --> 01:41:04.875
Look out!

01:41:17.666 --> 01:41:18.916
Help!

01:41:40.166 --> 01:41:42.750
I'll never forgive myself for this.

01:41:42.833 --> 01:41:45.583
I'm all right, dear boy.

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:49.916
I'm content to have seen my boy
and to take my chance.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.833
Jaggers will help us.
He'll get you off, all right.

01:41:56.666 --> 01:41:58.750
Prisoners at the bar.

01:41:59.875 --> 01:42:05.083
It is now my duty to pronounce
the sentence demanded by the law.

01:42:18.875 --> 01:42:21.125
The sentence of this court is...

01:42:22.583 --> 01:42:27.125
that you be taken hence to the place
from whence you came,

01:42:28.166 --> 01:42:31.958
and from thence to the place
of execution.

01:42:34.833 --> 01:42:40.666
And that each of you there be hanged
by the neck until you be dead.

01:42:42.291 --> 01:42:46.416
And may Almighty God
have mercy on your souls.

01:42:48.125 --> 01:42:51.166
Are you certain there is nothing
you can do to save him?

01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:55.333
Nothing. You realize that
you no longer inherit his money?

01:42:55.416 --> 01:42:58.416
- That will be claimed by the Crown.
- The money's of no interest.

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:03.250
If you'd been a blood relation, it might
have been different, but you are not.

01:43:05.375 --> 01:43:10.250
You mean, if he had a child,
the money would go to the child?

01:43:10.333 --> 01:43:12.416
The money might go to the child.

01:43:15.125 --> 01:43:18.583
Mr. Jaggers, there was a child.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:22.666
- So you think there was child?
- I know there was a child.

01:43:23.708 --> 01:43:26.041
And what's more, Mr. Jaggers,
you know it.

01:43:30.083 --> 01:43:32.166
Sit down, Pip.

01:43:37.083 --> 01:43:40.333
I'm going to put a case to you, Pip,
but I admit nothing.

01:43:40.416 --> 01:43:43.916
I understand. You admit nothing.

01:43:45.041 --> 01:43:48.291
Put the case that a woman
is charged with murder.

01:43:50.083 --> 01:43:55.041
Put the case that this woman
has a child whose father is a convict.

01:43:56.208 --> 01:43:59.375
- I understand perfectly.
- But that I make no admissions?

01:43:59.458 --> 01:44:01.500
But that you make no admissions.

01:44:01.583 --> 01:44:06.833
Now, Pip, put the case
that this woman's legal advisor

01:44:06.916 --> 01:44:11.041
knows an eccentric and very rich lady

01:44:11.125 --> 01:44:14.083
who is anxious to adopt a little girl.

01:44:14.958 --> 01:44:17.041
You understand, Pip?

01:44:18.416 --> 01:44:22.708
I understand, but I can hardly believe.

01:44:23.666 --> 01:44:25.958
Ring that bell, Mr. Pip.

01:44:38.708 --> 01:44:41.541
- Yes, sir?
- Basin.

01:44:41.625 --> 01:44:43.083
Yes, sir.

01:45:05.875 --> 01:45:07.333
Well, Pip?

01:45:10.708 --> 01:45:13.250
If I am in my right mind,

01:45:13.333 --> 01:45:16.250
and that woman is Estella's mother,

01:45:16.333 --> 01:45:20.166
this legal advisor you mention
will have a lot to answer for.

01:45:21.041 --> 01:45:22.750
Now, Pip.

01:45:22.833 --> 01:45:24.958
Put the case that this legal advisor

01:45:25.041 --> 01:45:28.166
has often seen children
tried at the criminal bar.

01:45:29.083 --> 01:45:32.250
Put the case that he has known them
to be imprisoned,

01:45:32.333 --> 01:45:37.708
whipped, neglected, cast out,
qualified in all ways for the hangman,

01:45:37.791 --> 01:45:40.416
and growing up to be hanged.

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:45.166
Put the case that here was one pretty,
little child that could be saved.

01:45:46.833 --> 01:45:49.791
Put that last case
to yourself very carefully, Pip.

01:45:51.041 --> 01:45:54.583
- I do, Mr. Jaggers.
- Did he do right?

01:45:58.666 --> 01:46:01.958
- He did right.
- Good.

01:46:03.833 --> 01:46:06.541
Does Estella know?

01:46:06.625 --> 01:46:09.958
You mean, does the little girl know?

01:46:10.041 --> 01:46:12.875
- Yes.
- No, she does not know.

01:46:12.958 --> 01:46:15.041
She must never be told.

01:46:15.125 --> 01:46:18.833
As to that, she has a claim
to her father's property.

01:46:18.916 --> 01:46:22.083
The legal advisor
must use his own judgment.

01:46:22.166 --> 01:46:24.750
Her father's condition
is considerably worse.

01:46:24.833 --> 01:46:27.250
He has been moved
to the prison infirmary.

01:46:49.416 --> 01:46:50.875
Dear boy.

01:46:52.208 --> 01:46:54.291
I thought you wasn't coming,

01:46:56.041 --> 01:46:59.666
yet I knew somehow that you would.

01:46:59.750 --> 01:47:04.291
It's just the time. I waited at the gate
so as not to lose a moment of it.

01:47:04.375 --> 01:47:06.583
God bless you.

01:47:06.666 --> 01:47:08.750
You've never deserted me.

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.583
And what's best of all is,

01:47:12.708 --> 01:47:15.666
you've been more comfortable
along'a me,

01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:17.833
since I was under a dark cloud...

01:47:19.833 --> 01:47:21.625
than when the sun shone.

01:47:22.708 --> 01:47:25.750
That's the best of all.

01:47:25.833 --> 01:47:28.166
Are you in pain?

01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:29.916
Aye.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.541
I don't complain of none, dear boy.

01:47:32.625 --> 01:47:34.708
You never do complain.

01:47:41.541 --> 01:47:43.625
You'd better stay.

01:47:50.458 --> 01:47:53.250
I have something to tell you.

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:56.416
Can you understand what I say?

01:48:01.958 --> 01:48:04.666
You had a child once

01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:06.833
whom you loved and lost.

01:48:09.625 --> 01:48:14.125
She lived and found powerful friends.

01:48:15.791 --> 01:48:17.875
She is living now.

01:48:19.041 --> 01:48:21.541
She is a lady

01:48:21.625 --> 01:48:24.458
and very beautiful.

01:48:24.541 --> 01:48:27.666
And I love her.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:47.791
Lord be merciful to him, a sinner.

01:49:13.583 --> 01:49:15.625
- Argh!
- Get out of the way, you fool!

01:50:11.666 --> 01:50:13.958
Is it Joe?

01:50:14.041 --> 01:50:16.125
Which it are, old chap.

01:50:20.041 --> 01:50:22.083
How long, Joe?

01:50:22.166 --> 01:50:25.625
Which you mean to say, Pip,
how long have your illness lasted?

01:50:25.708 --> 01:50:26.708
Yes, Joe.

01:50:26.791 --> 01:50:30.208
Well, it's the end of April, Pip.
Tomorrow's the first of May.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.083
Dear Joe.

01:50:36.541 --> 01:50:39.958
Have you been here... all the time?

01:50:40.041 --> 01:50:42.416
Oh, pretty nigh, old chap.

01:50:54.208 --> 01:50:57.333
Joe, where am I?

01:50:59.166 --> 01:51:01.250
You're home.

01:51:02.583 --> 01:51:05.416
I brought you home,
dear old Pip, old chap.

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.458
Oh, Joe!

01:51:09.541 --> 01:51:12.333
You break my heart.

01:51:12.416 --> 01:51:14.791
Please don't be so good to me.

01:51:14.875 --> 01:51:18.625
Now lookee here, old chap,
ever the best of friends.

01:51:19.708 --> 01:51:22.125
You'll soon be well enough
to go out again.

01:51:23.541 --> 01:51:27.500
And then, oh, what larks!

01:51:35.041 --> 01:51:40.916
Biddy, you have the best husband in
the world. And Joe, you've the best wife.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.708
Which I know, Pip, old chap,
which I know.

01:51:43.791 --> 01:51:47.666
- You'll be very happy.
- Which are our intention, Pip, old chap.

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:49.916
And you'll have children.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:53.041
Which also are our intention,
Pip, old chap.

01:51:53.125 --> 01:51:55.958
One day, Pip, you'll marry too.

01:51:57.125 --> 01:51:59.250
I don't think I shall, Biddy.

01:51:59.333 --> 01:52:00.541
Not now.

01:52:00.625 --> 01:52:03.333
Dear Pip, do you still fret for her?

01:52:04.458 --> 01:52:06.291
I think of her.

01:52:06.375 --> 01:52:08.875
But that poor dream,
Biddy, has all gone by.

01:52:10.041 --> 01:52:12.166
All gone by.

01:52:12.250 --> 01:52:14.500
I knew as I said these words

01:52:14.583 --> 01:52:18.125
that I secretly intended
to visit the old house that evening.

01:52:37.166 --> 01:52:40.125
- What name?
- Pumblechook.

01:52:40.208 --> 01:52:42.291
Quite right.

01:52:50.458 --> 01:52:52.541
Come in, Pip.

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:12.625
I know nothing of days of the week,

01:53:12.708 --> 01:53:15.166
nothing of weeks of the year.

01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:17.333
Don't loiter, boy!

01:53:30.666 --> 01:53:32.791
Come along, boy! Take your hat off.

01:53:43.291 --> 01:53:45.958
Whom have we here?
A boy.

01:53:46.041 --> 01:53:48.500
A boy of the
neighborhood, hey?

01:53:48.583 --> 01:53:51.541
But he is a common
laboring boy.

01:53:51.625 --> 01:53:53.958
You can break his heart.

01:53:58.125 --> 01:54:00.208
This door, boy.

01:54:09.041 --> 01:54:10.833
Pip!

01:54:13.416 --> 01:54:14.875
Estella!

01:54:20.916 --> 01:54:23.583
Estella, what are you doing here?

01:54:23.666 --> 01:54:27.333
I thought you were in
Paris with your husband.

01:54:28.708 --> 01:54:32.250
I have no husband, Pip.
Have you not heard?

01:54:32.333 --> 01:54:34.875
I've been ill, Estella.
I've heard nothing.

01:54:35.833 --> 01:54:40.250
When Mr. Jaggers disclosed to
Bentley Drummle my true parentage,

01:54:40.333 --> 01:54:42.833
he no longer wished
to have me for a wife.

01:54:42.916 --> 01:54:45.916
Well, Pip, why don't you laugh?

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.208
You've every right to.

01:54:48.291 --> 01:54:52.166
I've no wish to laugh, Estella.
I'm truly sorry.

01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:56.375
You've no need to pity me.
It has simplified my life.

01:54:56.458 --> 01:55:01.416
There's now no need to sell the house.
It is mine and I shall live here.

01:55:03.250 --> 01:55:05.875
I shall like it here, Pip.

01:55:05.958 --> 01:55:08.666
Away from the world
and all its complications.

01:55:21.583 --> 01:55:23.041
Estella...

01:55:24.083 --> 01:55:26.166
how long have you been here?

01:55:27.583 --> 01:55:29.666
I don't know.

01:55:32.458 --> 01:55:34.833
Estella, you must leave this house.

01:55:34.916 --> 01:55:38.791
It's a dead house. Nothing can live here.

01:55:38.875 --> 01:55:42.458
- Leave it, Estella, I beg of you.
- What do you mean?

01:55:42.541 --> 01:55:46.083
This is the house where I grew up.
It's part of me. It's my home.

01:55:46.166 --> 01:55:50.416
It's Miss Havisham's home. But she's
gone. Gone from this house, from us!

01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:55.541
She is not gone. She is still here with me
in this house, in this very room.

01:55:56.416 --> 01:55:58.958
Then I defy her.

01:56:00.250 --> 01:56:02.666
I have come back, Miss Havisham!

01:56:03.458 --> 01:56:06.500
I have come back to let in the sunlight!

01:56:33.041 --> 01:56:34.583
Look, Estella! Look!

01:56:34.666 --> 01:56:36.750
Nothing but dust and decay.

01:56:43.166 --> 01:56:47.416
I've never ceased to love you
even when there seemed no hope.

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:50.333
You're part of my existence,
part of myself.

01:56:50.416 --> 01:56:53.916
Estella, come with me,
out into the sunlight.

01:56:57.208 --> 01:56:58.875
Look at me.

01:56:58.958 --> 01:57:01.041
Pip, I'm afraid.

01:57:02.208 --> 01:57:04.291
Look at me.

01:57:09.250 --> 01:57:11.750
We belong to each other.

01:57:11.833 --> 01:57:14.458
Let's start again.

01:57:14.541 --> 01:57:16.458
Together.

01:57:16.541 --> 01:57:18.000
Oh, Pip!
