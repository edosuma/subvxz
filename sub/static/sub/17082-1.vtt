01:37.200 --> 01:38.326
No.

01:38.880 --> 01:39.961
Shh.

01:40.440 --> 01:41.680
Hello, Mr. Davis.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.282
My name is Jack Carter, and
you don't want to know me.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.009
Ugh!

01:46.035 --> 01:48.479
I know it's one just guy talking,
but I'll be honest with you.

01:48.480 --> 01:51.370
I don't understand what the
big freaking deal is. I don't.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.131
Listen asshole, I told Fletcher
I was gonna get him the money.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.446
- You shut up!
- Ugh!

01:55.640 --> 01:57.369
Give me a break, Jack.

01:57.560 --> 02:00.684
You haven't seen the guy in,
what, four, five years?

02:00.760 --> 02:03.161
He kicks and now suddenly
you give a shit?

02:03.360 --> 02:04.441
You Father Mulcahy?

02:04.720 --> 02:08.281
I'm so not buying this, it's not
even funny, kemo sabe.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.408
My little brother is dead.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.046
He left a family,
so I'm going. I owe him.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.402
Let me get this. Now you owe him?

02:15.640 --> 02:18.246
Here's the bad news:
It's a little late.

02:18.480 --> 02:22.530
Listen, the therapy session is
good, you know? You need it...

02:22.760 --> 02:26.651
but why don't I go somewhere
else? I'm gonna talk to...

02:27.680 --> 02:30.445
You sit here and you
shut your mouth...

02:31.080 --> 02:34.004
or this is going to the
next level, you got that?

02:34.240 --> 02:37.687
"Next level"? What is that?
A catch phrase or something?

02:38.800 --> 02:40.484
Catch phrase?

02:42.360 --> 02:43.407
Jack, come on.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.211
Take it easy or you'll give
yourself a fucking heart attack.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.880
Fletcher wants your ass here.
He's made that very clear to you.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.764
I'm like a broken record.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.691
If you don't take
care of business...

02:56.880 --> 02:59.929
the business will take care of you.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.921
- I'm taking care of business.
- Whatever.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.646
- What time is your flight?
- I'm not flying.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.201
- I beg your pardon?
- Not flying, Connie.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.928
Uh-huh. You got something
special working there?

03:12.160 --> 03:14.367
What? Knives, guns, flamethrowers?

03:14.680 --> 03:17.729
Something you're not telling
Con-a-won-a-doo-da-day?

03:20.920 --> 03:23.161
I'm back in a couple of days.

03:25.240 --> 03:28.164
Right. But, Jack?

06:43.760 --> 06:45.444
What are you doing here?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.968
I came to pay my respects.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.724
He could've used your
respect while he was alive.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.687
Is Doreen around?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.090
Yeah, she's around.

07:16.160 --> 07:21.087
I will lift up mine eyes unto the
hills, from whence cometh my help.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.921
My help cometh from the Lord,
which made Heaven and Earth.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.801
He will not suffer thy
foot to be moved:

07:28.040 --> 07:30.805
He that keepeth thee
will not slumber.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.642
Behold, He that keepeth Israel
shall neither slumber nor sleep.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.569
The Lord is thy keeper.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.883
The Lord is thy shade
upon thy right hand.

07:42.080 --> 07:46.165
The sun shall not smite thee
by day, nor the moon by night.

07:46.440 --> 07:49.091
The Lord shall preserve
thee from all evil.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.849
He shall preserve thy going out...

07:53.080 --> 07:55.845
and thy coming in from
this day forth...

07:56.120 --> 07:59.681
and even for evermore. Amen.

08:17.720 --> 08:20.644
How you doing? I'm Jack,
Richie's brother.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.731
Oh, shit, man. Hi, I'm Eddie.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.281
I worked with him
over at the George.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.727
Eddie, let me ask you a question:

08:30.720 --> 08:34.725
- Was my brother into something?
- Richie? No, man.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.643
He wasn't that type of guy.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.447
I'm very sorry about your father.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.685
Don't feel sorry for me.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.769
You don't know me.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.044
You're a picture on a piano.

09:13.800 --> 09:14.961
Hey.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.725
Hold up, would you?

09:16.960 --> 09:20.806
I couldn't help noticing you.
You stand out in a crowd.

09:21.440 --> 09:23.329
I'm Jack, Richie's brother.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.241
Oh.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.926
- I'm real sorry. He was a great guy.
- Yeah.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.281
So, uh, where'd you
know Richard from?

09:36.720 --> 09:38.324
Around the bar.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.684
You know how it goes.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.161
No.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.289
Why don't you tell me?

09:47.280 --> 09:50.443
I don't know you well
enough to get personal.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.489
You think something happened...

10:03.720 --> 10:06.530
between the time you saw
him and the accident?

10:06.760 --> 10:08.683
I don't know. Maybe, I guess.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.167
But you'd know if something was up.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.125
Shit, man, I don't know.
I guess. Yeah, maybe.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.488
Jack, that is enough!

10:16.760 --> 10:18.171
It's enough.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.441
What are you gonna do, rough me up?

10:58.600 --> 11:00.443
I like to be alone.

11:02.320 --> 11:03.401
Sure.

11:08.520 --> 11:13.003
I'm fine, all right?
I just came out for a smoke.

11:14.040 --> 11:18.443
You know, Doreen, you don't know me
very well, and what you do know...

11:19.360 --> 11:20.771
you don't like much.

11:21.400 --> 11:25.928
I'm gonna be here over the weekend,
so if you need anything at all...

11:26.200 --> 11:28.851
I'll be staying at the
Mercer Hotel, okay?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.480
- He didn't drink.
- What?

11:38.040 --> 11:39.485
My dad.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.402
He wouldn't drink and drive.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.368
So, what do you think happened?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.445
I don't know.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.250
Maybe...

12:01.040 --> 12:02.724
I don't know. Forget it.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.087
He's dead, right? What's it matter?

12:17.400 --> 12:19.528
Tell my mom I'll be home later.

12:29.320 --> 12:31.561
<i>What'd I tell you? What'd I say?</i>

12:31.720 --> 12:35.611
<i>Which part of "I can't let you go"
did you not under-fucking-stand?</i>

12:35.800 --> 12:36.847
<i>This is your job.</i>

12:37.040 --> 12:40.487
This is not a freaking charity
case. You do your job!

12:40.680 --> 12:42.842
I want your butt
down here tomorrow.

12:43.040 --> 12:47.170
I am the boss, Jack! Okay?

12:47.720 --> 12:48.926
<i>Got me?</i>

12:51.400 --> 12:53.767
<i>I can't believe you
guys kept this cat.</i>

12:54.000 --> 12:58.210
Richie and I used to hide stuff from
our mom underneath all the cookies.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.882
I'm pretty sure she knew, but
I don't think she really cared. Heh.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.083
So were you two guys okay?

13:07.880 --> 13:11.680
- What?
- I mean you and Richie...

13:13.160 --> 13:17.927
I mean, before the accident,
were you two getting along okay?

13:18.240 --> 13:21.881
- What kind of question is that?
- It's just a question.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.524
Was he drinking a lot more?
More than normal?

13:25.720 --> 13:27.643
What? Jack...

13:27.880 --> 13:30.451
Eddie said he didn't
see him drink much.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.803
Doreen said he wouldn't
drink and drive. I'm just...

13:34.080 --> 13:36.321
Oh, Jack. What are you doing?

13:36.560 --> 13:39.803
- What?
- Why do you care all of a sudden?

13:40.080 --> 13:41.684
Because he's dead?

13:42.960 --> 13:44.644
Where were you before?

13:46.640 --> 13:50.929
He was your brother. You disappeared
on him, and now he's gone.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.129
So, what am I supposed to do?

13:55.320 --> 13:57.607
Take a trip down
memory lane with you?

13:59.080 --> 14:01.481
Catch you up on how he's doing?

14:02.360 --> 14:05.489
What do you think you're gonna
do, come and fix things?

14:06.560 --> 14:07.971
You don't fix things.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.763
You break things.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.240
Remember?

14:16.120 --> 14:17.884
- <i>Hello, it's Connie.</i>
- It's me.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.969
<i>Jack! What do you say?</i>

14:20.200 --> 14:23.886
Fucking white of you to call.
Fletcher ripped me a new asshole.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.487
- You on your way back?
- I'm staying a while.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.961
Come on, look.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.243
Who do you think is taking
the heat? We're partners.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.960
You're screwed, I'm screwed.
He wants you.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.409
- You need a written invitation?
- I got some things to do.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.445
Okay, here's the
truth as I know it.

14:40.680 --> 14:44.048
I don't know how much longer
I can cover your ass.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.368
- We gonna see Fletcher?
- Absolutely.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.846
<i>We are there.</i>

14:48.040 --> 14:50.884
You got something to say?
What do you want to say?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.731
It's time to chop it
up with the big dog.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.003
<i>Because I'm hearing talk,
Jack. People are talking.</i>

14:57.240 --> 15:00.847
About you and Audrey. I don't
know if I can keep it from him.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.128
They must be hearing it from you.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.161
- <i>Am I right?</i>
- You simple bitch!

15:05.240 --> 15:07.368
I'm covering your ass.
Do you hear me?

15:07.560 --> 15:10.131
- I'm covering your ass!
- <i>Better cover your own ass.</i>

15:37.480 --> 15:39.528
Which way is Brumby's office?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.965
Listen, I don't want to
hear you can't find it.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.049
This was supposed to be done.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.402
A guy died the other night.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.890
Can you hold on a second?

15:52.240 --> 15:53.651
Can I help you?

15:53.800 --> 15:56.644
I'm Jack Carter. Richie's brother.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.130
I'll call you right back.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.964
Christ. I'm, uh, sorry
I wasn't at the funeral.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.766
Never could take them.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.411
Would you like some, uh,
coffee or something?

16:12.600 --> 16:14.762
No, I'm fine, thanks.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.121
He was a good bloke, Richie was.

16:18.600 --> 16:22.491
Saved my ass a lot of money
just by doing a solid job.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.480
How long was he running
this place for you?

16:26.720 --> 16:30.008
Since we've been up.
About five years.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.766
- Five years and no problems?
- None.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.370
No enemies?

16:37.240 --> 16:41.882
Well, not that I know of. I mean,
he was an easygoing sort of bloke.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.202
Does he seem like a
guy to get drunk...

16:46.440 --> 16:48.966
and go out driving in a rainstorm?

16:50.360 --> 16:52.044
- Not to me.
- Me neither.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.360
Where is this going?

17:01.960 --> 17:04.008
I think he was taken out.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.285
Taken out?

17:06.560 --> 17:07.721
Richie?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.729
Why would you say that?

17:12.280 --> 17:14.601
There's something
you're not telling me.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.242
- What the hell does that mean?
- Relax.

17:17.480 --> 17:21.484
I don't like hard cases coming in
and talking like I know something.

17:21.720 --> 17:25.520
If someone's putting out something
about me, I want to know who.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.882
And when I know what and who...

17:28.040 --> 17:32.204
I might just take the matter
up with you, Jack. Mightn't I?

17:34.240 --> 17:36.971
You're a big man,
but you're out of shape.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.528
With me, it's a full-time job.
So please, sit down.

17:47.360 --> 17:48.600
Thank you.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.565
I know you got security
cameras around the bar.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.121
Did the police ask to
look at the tapes?

17:55.320 --> 17:57.561
Why would they?
It was drunk driving.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.207
Mind if I do?

18:03.760 --> 18:07.560
That's got the, uh, whole night on it.
Did you talk to Geraldine?

18:07.760 --> 18:09.489
Who's Geraldine?

18:09.760 --> 18:13.048
Oh, Christ. How am
I gonna put this?

18:13.320 --> 18:17.803
She was his, uh, lady on
the side, his <i>innamorata.</i>

18:21.760 --> 18:23.330
You know this for sure?

18:23.680 --> 18:26.490
What can I tell you?
It wasn't a big thing.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.444
Not many people knew about it.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.965
Cyrus.

18:42.480 --> 18:43.686
How you doing?

18:44.640 --> 18:45.687
Holy shit.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.927
Well, if it ain't the Vegas
man with the Vegas tan.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.164
Geraldine, right?

19:05.800 --> 19:06.881
Been a long time.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.441
Yeah, Jack, it's been
a very long time.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.684
I heard about Richie, man.
That's pretty messed up.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.041
Yeah.

19:18.080 --> 19:22.529
You got my deepest condolences
and all that shit.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.246
I appreciate that.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.528
You still running with Fletcher?

19:27.720 --> 19:30.803
Why not? How are you
making a living?

19:31.040 --> 19:33.520
- Well, I'm making.
- With who?

19:33.760 --> 19:37.207
- With somebody. What do you care?
- I don't care.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.171
I want to know if you're
still a bottom-feeder.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.609
Let me tell you something.
You see all this shit here?

19:43.760 --> 19:44.841
You see it?

19:45.040 --> 19:49.568
This is the new world, brother.
I'm on-line. My girls. My business.

19:50.120 --> 19:54.569
While you're running around chasing
deadbeats for some fucking asshole...

19:54.800 --> 19:59.362
I'm swimming in the big pool, baby.
I got the juice around here now.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.605
I hooked up with this freak
and this foreign guy.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.246
Created my own little empire.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.891
Look at you.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.406
The little man versus the start-up.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.729
You got a problem with me?

20:19.680 --> 20:21.569
Let me tell you something, Jack.

20:22.480 --> 20:26.041
I think you should take
a very big moment...

20:26.360 --> 20:28.761
and just think about where you are.

20:29.360 --> 20:31.488
Because this ain't
yesterday, slick.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.167
Relax, I'm just playing with you.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.970
Oh, yeah, I get that.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.168
Don't put your hands on me.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.522
Come on, let me see your eyes.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.646
Come on.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.687
Whatever turns you on, Jack.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.530
Still pretty? Hmm?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.240
Yeah.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.362
Like cat piss in the snow.

21:12.240 --> 21:13.480
See you around.

21:32.880 --> 21:35.884
Hey, you can't come...
Hey, you can't come in here.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.003
Hey, mate, where are you going?

21:43.720 --> 21:46.564
Is this the part where I'm
supposed to be scared?

21:46.920 --> 21:48.445
You Carter?

21:50.920 --> 21:52.410
That's right.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.767
And you really don't
want to know me.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.001
Shit, it's good to be home.

22:26.360 --> 22:29.250
Cyrus, I never met him.
Get off. I don't know him.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.403
Shut up and get in the car.

23:40.280 --> 23:44.046
- Good afternoon. Are you a member?
- I'm here with Mr. Franklin.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.967
Go right ahead.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.721
Hey, pal, you're
walking on my line.

24:01.880 --> 24:05.043
Just smile, sweetheart, and
get rid of the guy, okay?

24:15.280 --> 24:16.770
Nice stroke.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.764
Who the fuck are you?

24:20.920 --> 24:21.967
Tiger Woods.

24:23.040 --> 24:25.691
I'm gonna go and get
security, all right?

24:30.040 --> 24:32.725
- Can I help you, sir?
- I don't know.

24:35.720 --> 24:38.610
Ahem. Are you from the club?
Is there a problem?

24:40.280 --> 24:43.409
My brother died the other
night, and now I'm here.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.404
- Listen, uh, Mister...
- Carter.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.688
Carter. Mr. Carter. Um...

24:51.520 --> 24:55.002
I'm real sorry about your
brother. That, uh, sucks.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.323
But I can't help you here.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.601
I suggest you contact my outreach
program at the offices...

25:02.800 --> 25:04.768
Mind if we talk a minute?

25:05.280 --> 25:07.442
Uh, yes, I mind.

25:07.680 --> 25:11.127
I was under the impression
this was a private club.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.201
We should go someplace and talk.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.762
- Listen, scary man...
- I scare you?

25:22.240 --> 25:23.366
Okay.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.404
Whatever this is, it isn't
going over real well.

25:27.960 --> 25:31.567
Drive me to my car. We'll talk
on the way. Is that a problem?

25:31.800 --> 25:35.771
- Yeah, it is a problem.
- No, no. It's a problem if you don't.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.729
Come on. It's okay. Come on.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.044
- So, what's your name?
- Jeremy Kinnear.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.521
Maybe you've read
about me in Forbes.

25:49.880 --> 25:53.566
I don't do that, Jeremy. What are
you saying? You're bucks-up?

25:53.760 --> 25:55.569
Without blowing my horn...

25:55.800 --> 25:58.644
my computer company is
worth a gazillion dollars.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.443
- Give or take.
- Your folks must be very proud.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.769
I paid off my loans, bought
them a house in France.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.445
They leave me alone.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.761
I think we've got a
mutual acquaintance.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.849
- Really?
- Yeah. Cyrus Paice.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.645
Yeah, I know him.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.326
I try not to spend too
much time around him.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.410
What's the connection?

26:29.000 --> 26:32.561
Mr. Carter, I really don't
have to answer your questions.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.923
Sure you do, Jeremy.

26:42.160 --> 26:43.730
What's the connection?

26:49.640 --> 26:51.881
Okay, Mr. Carter, fine.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.164
You know, um...

26:55.160 --> 26:58.130
when you spend most of your
life behind a computer...

26:58.400 --> 27:01.882
things like golf and girls become
pretty important, you know?

27:03.280 --> 27:05.408
They don't go well
with the glasses...

27:05.640 --> 27:08.849
and pocket-protector image
my stockholders prefer.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.122
- So...
- So he pulls for you.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.245
You know why I like
golf, Mr. Carter?

27:28.640 --> 27:31.928
Because the ball just
keeps going away.

27:35.320 --> 27:39.006
Only sport where you hit the
sucker and it doesn't come back.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.808
I've got to want to go after it.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.049
And when I get to it...

27:47.640 --> 27:49.642
I just knock it away again.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.248
See what I'm saying, Mr. Carter?

27:56.400 --> 27:58.164
Once I get rid of it...

27:59.720 --> 28:01.927
I never want to see it again.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.970
He said his brother
died and now he's here.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.481
He's here! You get me?
We are fucked!

28:17.720 --> 28:19.165
Excuse me, Mr. Kinnear.

28:19.320 --> 28:23.211
- Can you get your feet off the table?
- Yes, sorry. Sure.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.401
No, you listen to me.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.888
You asked me to get you on-line.
I did. Fair trade.

28:31.080 --> 28:34.687
You start this porn. I said,
"Keep me clean," but you can't.

28:34.920 --> 28:38.242
I can't think what happens if
he's taken it to the police.

28:38.480 --> 28:42.041
How'd he get it, anyway? It's
supposed to go to the hard drive.

28:43.480 --> 28:47.610
Damn right I'm freaking out! I'm a
Harvard grad. I do not do porn.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.728
No, shush!

28:53.200 --> 28:55.726
I don't want to know what happened.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.400
I don't care.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.524
It's none of my business.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.849
I just want the big brother gone.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.963
Not "gone" like the other guy.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.885
I mean away. I want him
away, I want you away.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.122
I want the whole thing done.

29:39.280 --> 29:40.327
Hello.

29:41.600 --> 29:45.844
- Where's the big bad wolf?
- Out with the pigs, I guess.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.280
He wants you back...

29:47.520 --> 29:51.491
Look, Audrey. I was thinking that, uh,
when I get back, you and me...

29:51.720 --> 29:54.121
we gotta get out of Vegas for good.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.651
Jack...

29:56.880 --> 29:58.166
I can't do this.

30:01.080 --> 30:02.127
Do what?

30:02.360 --> 30:03.930
<i>You and me.</i>

30:04.600 --> 30:06.921
Les Fletcher is my job.
It's what I do.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.650
You...

30:12.560 --> 30:14.164
you're...

30:14.520 --> 30:16.727
you're something different.

30:18.760 --> 30:22.765
All right, fine. You ought to get
out of there, with or without me...

30:23.000 --> 30:26.083
- <i>but you ought to get out.</i>
- Hey, Audrey!

30:26.320 --> 30:27.526
I'm up here!

30:27.760 --> 30:29.489
- Get down here.
- I gotta go.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.684
Yeah, it's good.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.041
Another time, another place, huh?

30:41.880 --> 30:43.120
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:44.880 --> 30:46.041
<i>Bye.</i>

31:01.080 --> 31:04.721
<i>Sometimes I feel I'm gonna be
alone for the rest of my life.</i>

31:05.000 --> 31:07.321
<i>I wake up and look
at my little girl...</i>

31:07.480 --> 31:11.041
and I wonder when it was
we became strangers.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.283
She's all I have now, Jack,
and I want her back so bad...

31:14.480 --> 31:16.721
and I don't even
know where she went.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.684
She won't talk to me.
She won't even yell at me.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.690
Oh, my God.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.081
- Who are you?
- What?

31:28.040 --> 31:31.965
I mean, I'm just trying
to make sense of this...

31:32.320 --> 31:33.367
of you.

31:33.920 --> 31:36.161
You disappear for five years...

31:36.360 --> 31:38.010
then you come back.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.610
Come back...

31:41.800 --> 31:45.964
I don't know, you look like Frank
Sinatra or something and...

31:48.400 --> 31:50.528
I just can't figure you out.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.969
You know, it's not that
big a deal, Gloria.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.289
Everything changes, they say.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.931
Why not me?

32:03.480 --> 32:06.324
I just want to try to do
something right. Once.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.927
Yeah, well, what is that, though?

32:10.960 --> 32:14.931
What's right, Jack? You're too
late to be Richie's brother.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.165
You can't be Doreen's dad.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.168
And you can't be my man.

32:22.720 --> 32:25.451
So I just don't know where you fit.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.286
Maybe I don't.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.924
Maybe I don't.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.166
I'm sorry.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.691
Eddie!

33:33.320 --> 33:35.209
- You know Geraldine?
- What?

33:35.400 --> 33:37.767
Geraldine. Do you
know where she lives?

33:38.160 --> 33:39.571
I don't know, man.

33:40.440 --> 33:44.001
The girl that hung around Richie,
do you know where she lives?

33:44.240 --> 33:46.004
- A girl? What?
- Come on.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.328
So you know Doreen much?

33:55.880 --> 33:56.927
Uh...

33:57.120 --> 33:58.326
Yeah, a little.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.687
It's right up here on the left.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.447
So, uh, you done with me, man?

34:11.639 --> 34:13.641
No. Sit tight, I'll be right back.

34:27.159 --> 34:30.482
Relax, everything is okay.
How you doing?

34:31.159 --> 34:33.606
Do you know where Geraldine is?

34:41.960 --> 34:43.849
What was Richie to you?

34:45.000 --> 34:48.208
- You can't just break into my house.
- What was he to you?

34:49.080 --> 34:50.730
I told you.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.850
I met him at the bar.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.367
He was just a guy I met.

34:59.320 --> 35:00.731
That's all.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.287
That's all?

35:07.080 --> 35:10.323
- He was nicer than most.
- Did you know he was married?

35:13.080 --> 35:14.844
- Look...
- Did you know that?

35:15.040 --> 35:16.485
What do you want?

35:16.920 --> 35:20.322
I talked to him. It's not a crime.
I gotta be somewhere.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.482
I want to know what happened.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.884
You don't want to know.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.165
Geraldine.

35:31.960 --> 35:33.246
Look at me.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.645
Look at me.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.967
I didn't come up here to hurt you.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.131
I just want to know what happened.

35:49.320 --> 35:51.607
Richie wanted me to leave with him.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.885
He and his wife weren't
getting along so well.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.650
Hardly spoke, you know?

35:58.960 --> 36:01.008
They were gonna get divorced.

36:02.200 --> 36:05.647
He wanted me to run away,
someplace like New York.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.367
I said I couldn't
do that, you know?

36:12.240 --> 36:14.129
I got my own life here.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.801
Yeah.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.322
I went to the bar to say
goodbye, and he followed me out.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.844
And he makes this big
scene outside the bar.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.041
I hear he got pretty drunk.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.645
Look, I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

36:59.240 --> 37:00.844
The keys are in it.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.125
Carter.

37:36.160 --> 37:39.050
Looks like the rain must
have backed up the sewer.

37:40.440 --> 37:41.566
How you been, man?

37:41.720 --> 37:44.610
- Still hanging around, Thorpey?
- I like it here.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.407
I gotta have a word with you.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.726
Confidential.

37:50.360 --> 37:53.648
You just stay in the car.
What do you want to tell me?

37:55.720 --> 37:58.564
- How you been? I mean, you look good.
- Thank you.

37:59.240 --> 38:01.527
I'm losing sleep here.
What do you want?

38:05.760 --> 38:08.001
Here, take this. It's free.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.688
- Alaska Airlines, first class.
- That's nice.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.971
Who do I have to thank?

38:16.520 --> 38:19.967
I've been asked to make sure you
get on that plane. Tonight.

38:23.320 --> 38:26.085
Whatever they're paying
you, it ain't enough.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.444
What you want to do, cowboy?

38:40.200 --> 38:41.929
Take your best shot. Come on!

38:42.120 --> 38:43.451
Come on, shoot him.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.171
You got the stuff?

38:45.360 --> 38:47.761
You got the balls?
Let's see you do it.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.009
Put the gun down.
Put it down. Put it down.

38:52.760 --> 38:53.807
Big man.

39:18.960 --> 39:20.166
Whoa.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.047
Come on. Come on!

39:41.440 --> 39:42.487
Come on.

39:59.880 --> 40:00.961
Get back!

40:02.520 --> 40:03.726
Out of the way!

40:07.040 --> 40:08.201
Shit!

40:31.600 --> 40:32.726
Oh, shit!

41:14.200 --> 41:15.247
Shit!

41:37.040 --> 41:39.168
Okay. Okay.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.525
Fuck!

41:46.440 --> 41:47.487
Ride's over.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.524
I delivered the ticket
because you knew my brother.

41:50.720 --> 41:53.087
- I knew you wouldn't do it!
- Who sent you?

41:53.320 --> 41:56.722
- I can't say.
- Were you involved with my brother?

41:56.920 --> 41:58.922
I had nothing to do with Richie.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.811
Then give me a name,
or you're history.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.204
Brumby's in the back.

42:19.320 --> 42:22.164
- Carter?
- So now you're a travel agent.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.771
- What?
- Very nice touch, sending Thorpey.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.121
Very nostalgic.

42:28.200 --> 42:31.363
- What are you talking about?
- What'd Richie have on you?

42:32.520 --> 42:34.602
Bloody hell! Richie was my friend.

42:34.800 --> 42:38.009
Does it take a fucking miracle
for you to believe that?

42:38.800 --> 42:40.564
You're not giving me anything.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.688
Okay, Jack, Jack, Jack.

42:42.920 --> 42:46.208
Stop that. Stop it,
for fuck's sake.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.886
Look, okay.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.811
I owed this bloke some money.

42:51.040 --> 42:55.011
He fronted a truckload last
year to extend the club.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.687
He calls me this afternoon,
says he'll wipe the slate clean...

42:58.880 --> 43:01.406
if I'll do this, uh, thing for him.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.048
He said he wanted you out of town.

43:04.200 --> 43:08.922
That's all. He didn't say
how, just out of town.

43:10.280 --> 43:13.409
Your brother was my friend,
Jack. I wouldn't hurt him.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.291
Yeah.

43:19.520 --> 43:22.649
Give me a name or this is
going to another level.

43:28.320 --> 43:29.526
Cyrus Paice.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.362
You want me out? You want me out?

43:39.560 --> 43:42.086
You want to do this?
You want to do this?

43:42.280 --> 43:44.726
Rabbit's out of the hat.
Will it jump?

43:45.240 --> 43:48.403
- What did you do to Richie?
- Goddamn you! I did nothing.

43:49.160 --> 43:53.768
I hate to be the bearer of bad
news, but you're chasing your ass.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.443
You were gone too long,
brother. Shit changes.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.365
Maybe not you, but
some shit does change.

44:01.120 --> 44:05.444
Your precious brother, Richie,
was no goddamn saint.

44:06.280 --> 44:09.363
Everybody's into something,
Jack. Plain and simple.

44:10.040 --> 44:12.247
There's no mystery, no intrigue.

44:12.440 --> 44:15.649
He got juiced up one night.
He got oiled up...

44:15.880 --> 44:19.202
and he wrapped his sorry
ass around a tree.

44:19.480 --> 44:21.289
End of story.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.845
Now if you want to do this little
dance here for old time's sake...

44:26.040 --> 44:27.326
bring it.

44:27.800 --> 44:30.963
Let me tell you, you'll end
up like a one-legged man...

44:31.160 --> 44:33.083
in an ass-kicking contest.

44:33.840 --> 44:37.367
I'm tired of your bullshit,
Jack. I'm a businessman.

44:37.560 --> 44:40.404
I got ladies waiting
for me on the inside.

44:41.080 --> 44:42.127
Grow up, Jack.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.844
Uncle Jack.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.207
I didn't think you
were gonna show up.

45:08.880 --> 45:11.121
I was in the
neighborhood, you know?

45:11.840 --> 45:14.241
Listen, Doreen, I'm out
having one of those...

45:14.640 --> 45:17.041
year-long nights.
I'm not fun to be around.

45:17.240 --> 45:19.686
Maybe we should take
a rain check on this.

45:20.040 --> 45:21.371
Okay?

45:22.480 --> 45:23.641
Okay.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.367
- Bye.
- I'll give you a call tomorrow.

45:29.520 --> 45:30.931
Doreen.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.567
You hungry?

45:38.200 --> 45:39.486
A little.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.004
You drink coffee?

45:52.920 --> 45:54.285
Yeah.

45:58.120 --> 45:59.724
I smoke too.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.487
I don't think that's
worth bragging about.

46:02.720 --> 46:04.085
You smoke.

46:04.320 --> 46:06.607
Well, I did. But I
just recently quit.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.290
Oh, yeah? When?

46:08.520 --> 46:09.760
Oh, I'd say about...

46:10.160 --> 46:11.400
now.

46:12.200 --> 46:14.123
So if you don't mind...

46:39.240 --> 46:41.049
Makes you nuts, doesn't it?

46:41.240 --> 46:43.402
It's having an impact, yes.

46:43.960 --> 46:46.566
You are so freaky.

46:46.760 --> 46:50.606
Well, we're all a
little freaky, Doreen.

46:51.960 --> 46:54.770
It's the straight ones
we gotta worry about.

47:02.560 --> 47:03.891
So.

47:04.080 --> 47:07.289
What do you do, like, for work?

47:07.480 --> 47:09.403
- What did your dad say?
- He didn't.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.045
That's good.

47:11.920 --> 47:13.968
Mom said you were a gambler.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.642
Isn't that illegal?

47:17.600 --> 47:19.364
Are you a bookie?

47:19.880 --> 47:22.281
Bookie? No. More like...

47:22.560 --> 47:25.006
a financial adjuster.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.321
So.

47:33.240 --> 47:35.004
You ever been to prison?

47:37.440 --> 47:39.488
- How long?
- How about this weather?

47:40.320 --> 47:41.924
Come on.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.881
What do you say we
change the subject?

47:46.520 --> 47:48.170
All right. Fine.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.809
- You ever shoot anybody?
- Heh.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.287
You want to know what
I do for a living?

47:57.520 --> 48:00.683
Simple. People make promises
and they break them.

48:01.160 --> 48:03.606
My job is to refresh their memory.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.201
That's about it. No big deal.

48:09.800 --> 48:11.723
What's with the clothes?

48:14.320 --> 48:18.120
- What's with the jewelry in your face?
- You don't like it.

48:20.280 --> 48:21.725
It's nice.

48:24.080 --> 48:25.491
You ever been married?

48:27.360 --> 48:29.442
I don't think so.

48:30.560 --> 48:32.483
You don't have your own family.

48:38.360 --> 48:39.930
What are you?

48:55.640 --> 48:57.404
<i>Why'd you leave?</i>

48:57.720 --> 49:00.326
<i>Well, Doreen, that's
a long, long story.</i>

49:00.520 --> 49:02.409
<i>It's a long, long ride.</i>

49:05.360 --> 49:07.203
Let's put it this way:

49:07.400 --> 49:10.609
You ever want to take every
mirror and get rid of it...

49:10.840 --> 49:13.207
because you didn't like
what it reflected?

49:14.840 --> 49:15.887
Yeah.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.850
I wish my dad was here.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.006
Me too.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.209
Do you, um...?

49:33.120 --> 49:35.691
Do you really think
somebody killed him?

49:38.360 --> 49:40.761
Yeah, I think so, but...

49:44.480 --> 49:45.766
Me too.

50:08.080 --> 50:10.082
- Do you have a license yet?
- Yep.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.488
What, did you learn that in school?

50:12.680 --> 50:14.444
- Dad taught me.
- Oh, yeah?

50:18.920 --> 50:20.809
Would you wait in the car?

50:21.200 --> 50:22.770
- Why?
- It's all right.

50:22.960 --> 50:26.442
Please wait in the car.
I'll be right back. It's okay.

50:33.400 --> 50:37.485
<i>If you need help, hang up
and then dial the operator.</i>

50:51.640 --> 50:52.846
Jack!

50:53.040 --> 50:54.690
- You okay?
- You seen Doreen?

50:54.880 --> 50:56.848
- What happened?
- Where is she?

50:57.040 --> 51:00.249
- Who did it?
- He came... I don't know. He came in.

51:09.080 --> 51:12.129
Are you okay?
It's gonna be all right.

51:12.400 --> 51:13.561
Really.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.806
- Why did they do this?
- I don't know.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.725
But I want to find out,
you can believe that.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.170
- Let's go get your mom.
- Where are we going?

51:26.880 --> 51:29.531
I want you guys to stay
with me tonight, okay?

51:36.720 --> 51:38.882
Gloria, why don't
we get out of here?

51:41.240 --> 51:43.402
I'm fine. I'm okay.

51:46.040 --> 51:48.407
I need to talk to your
Uncle Jack alone.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.686
What's wrong?

51:57.920 --> 51:59.800
- I need you to leave, Jack.
- What?

51:59.960 --> 52:03.681
My mom's coming over. We'll go
to her place and stay there.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.969
Listen, I know that
you want to help.

52:07.960 --> 52:09.041
Just look around.

52:09.240 --> 52:12.767
Look what you brought into
my house. Look at my face.

52:13.040 --> 52:15.805
Look at my family.
You're not helping, Jack.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.365
So please go.

52:17.680 --> 52:21.890
What did you say? I brought in?
I didn't bring anything here.

52:22.080 --> 52:24.731
Tell me, what the
hell was Richie into?

52:25.840 --> 52:27.251
Oh, God!

52:30.400 --> 52:31.447
Okay.

52:31.680 --> 52:34.081
- My head hurts.
- That's all right.

52:34.600 --> 52:37.649
Whatever this costs,
I'll just take care of it.

52:38.960 --> 52:40.962
You guys should get out of town.

52:41.200 --> 52:44.488
Take a vacation. I'll
take care of that too.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.041
We're fine. We're fine.

52:47.280 --> 52:48.566
Just go.

52:59.560 --> 53:01.289
I'm sorry, Gloria.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.286
Hey.

53:39.640 --> 53:40.766
I snuck out.

53:42.200 --> 53:43.725
Took a cab.

53:45.720 --> 53:47.688
Grandma's house smells funny.

53:49.200 --> 53:50.770
Do you want to come in?

53:55.280 --> 53:56.327
Nice tattoos.

53:59.120 --> 54:02.920
I'll bring her by in the
morning. Yeah, I promise.

54:03.880 --> 54:05.041
All right.

54:05.280 --> 54:06.441
Good night.

54:12.120 --> 54:14.327
Your mother is a little upset.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.769
It was your idea to call her.

54:16.960 --> 54:18.962
Listen, I don't mind.

54:20.040 --> 54:22.725
She cares about you, she loves you.

54:23.960 --> 54:26.964
That's pretty special.
You got one mother, right?

54:28.040 --> 54:32.125
It's a real scary place out
there, so I don't blame her.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.444
You must be a little tired.

54:39.680 --> 54:42.001
Why don't you take the bed?

54:42.200 --> 54:45.283
I got a lot of work to
do in the other room.

54:45.480 --> 54:47.960
I'll take you home in
the morning, okay?

54:50.240 --> 54:52.242
It's gonna be all right, really.

56:19.880 --> 56:21.166
I was coming for you.

56:22.080 --> 56:25.562
Bet you didn't know you had
a fairy godmother, Jack.

56:26.760 --> 56:30.970
- What was on the disc you gave Richie?
- A fairy godmother all of your own.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.401
Don't play me, Geraldine.
No more games.

56:35.920 --> 56:37.922
No more dress up, understand?

56:38.600 --> 56:40.170
You gave my brother a disc.

56:41.040 --> 56:42.644
What was on it?

56:43.280 --> 56:45.123
- I don't know what you're...
- No.

56:45.320 --> 56:48.483
I tell you, if you lie to me,
I'm gonna break every...

56:48.680 --> 56:49.966
Listen to me.

56:51.080 --> 56:54.323
I'm gonna break every
beautiful bone in your body.

56:55.240 --> 56:57.242
I'm not lying to you.

56:58.160 --> 57:00.731
I'm just here because
he wanted to see you.

57:00.920 --> 57:02.251
Who?

57:03.920 --> 57:05.649
The Demon King.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.241
He wanted to see you,
so he made some calls...

57:08.480 --> 57:11.802
and he waved his
magic wand and poof!

57:27.560 --> 57:29.164
Shit!

57:31.880 --> 57:33.325
Sorry.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.163
Hell of a day you had,
huh, Mr. Carter?

57:40.440 --> 57:42.249
Sorry to get you up so early.

57:42.440 --> 57:44.602
Personally, I hate mornings.

57:55.080 --> 57:56.684
Where are you going?

57:57.600 --> 58:00.444
She's done her job. She
doesn't need to hear this.

58:04.400 --> 58:05.447
Oh.

58:05.600 --> 58:08.809
Don't worry about Jimmy.
He's more here for decoration.

58:12.480 --> 58:16.166
You want a cappuccino?
He makes a really mean froth.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.691
I use nonfat milk.

58:18.720 --> 58:21.769
Thanks, but I'm lactose intolerant.

58:23.040 --> 58:24.166
What?

58:24.840 --> 58:25.887
Um...

58:26.080 --> 58:29.641
Jimmy, could you show our
friend down to her car?

58:32.960 --> 58:34.007
Thanks.

58:34.200 --> 58:36.965
- Cute guy.
- You think?

58:37.680 --> 58:38.727
No.

58:47.240 --> 58:49.891
I had my 30th birthday last month.

58:58.240 --> 59:01.961
I'm worth about $900 million.

59:02.680 --> 59:05.365
I'm in <i>Newsweek</i> and
<i>Forbes</i> in the same month.

59:05.600 --> 59:08.922
I'm the all-powerful ruler of
time and space, Mr. Carter.

59:09.120 --> 59:12.408
And your friend Cyrus...

59:15.760 --> 59:17.250
the porn guy...

59:18.920 --> 59:21.969
he's coming to me with
threats of going public.

59:23.600 --> 59:25.523
Messing up my image.

59:42.400 --> 59:44.164
Okay, awkward moment.

59:48.280 --> 59:51.602
Look, I've never really done
this before, but, um...

59:52.680 --> 59:55.570
I figure you probably have, so...

59:56.040 --> 59:57.451
here goes.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.527
I heard there was quite a fuss
the other night at the George.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.247
Where's the disc?

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.922
Everybody's shitting
bricks, especially Cyrus.

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.483
Your brother Richard's
name was mentioned.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.566
Cyrus goes out with
some very bad guys...

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.842
<i>and when he comes back...</i>

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.168
your brother's gone.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.961
You see what I'm
saying, Mr. Carter?

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:35.405
I think we both want
the same thing.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.161
Who do you think
you're fucking with?

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.405
Come on, come on.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.962
- Yeah?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.570
- What do you want?
- What do I fucking want?

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.040
Talk.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.969
I said, talk!

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.804
- Jack.
- <i>Tell him.</i>

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.490
<i>Tell him!</i>

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.120
Con says you're doing
her behind my back.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.561
Tell me Con's lying. Tell me that!

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.728
- He is lying!
- Is your name Jack?

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.088
I love her, and I want to kill her.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.124
I don't like you, so who
knows what I'd do to you!

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.971
You're a real tough
guy on the phone.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.561
Audrey, get out. Go on,
he won't touch you.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.962
Oh, I won't touch her, huh?

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:51.084
- Jack, please, listen...
- If you don't fucking shut up...

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.410
<i>I'm telling you, I'm two seconds away
from fucking pasting this broad.</i>

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.649
<i>Get back in town, or you're
both gonna be so fucking...</i>

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:03.970
You lay a hand on her, and I swear
I'll come back and bury you alive.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.482
<i>When I finish with you, you'll
fucking wish I killed you.</i>

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.682
What do you want to do? I'm here.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.245
Are you pathetic?

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:14.450
Go ahead, tell him, Audrey.
What do you want to do?

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.403
Audrey, what do you want to do?

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.401
- <i>You listening, lover-boy?</i>
- Yeah.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.090
<i>You getting it?</i>

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.047
Les, I'm out of Vegas,
understand? It ends here.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:34.250
<i>Fuck you. It ends when
I say so, you cocksucker.</i>

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.729
<i>Come on, baby, get in there.</i>

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.526
<i>Get that fine booty
in there. What's up?</i>

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.609
<i>You got some...</i>

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.845
<i>Showtime.</i>

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.410
<i>We're taking you to a party.</i>

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.807
<i>Come on, it'll be fun.</i>

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.645
<i>Yeah, baby, that's it.</i>

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.766
<i>No.</i>

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.285
<i>I need to leave. I need to leave.</i>

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.526
<i>It's cool.</i>

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.327
<i>No.</i>

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.007
What do you say?

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.684
You pick me a winner today?

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.523
You come up with a sure thing?

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.691
It's a bad time, Con.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.329
Boy, you're telling me.
You remember Peter, don't you?

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.650
Jack! Jack!

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.847
No!

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.725
No, Jack!

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.644
Say, Jack.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:48.848
When I said you take care of business
or business will take care of you...

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:51.003
did we have a bad connection?

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.884
Maybe you weren't listening?

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.722
Fuck it. It don't matter, does it?

01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.165
I was real sorry to hear
about you and Audrey.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.243
He's the big dog. There's
no way around that.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.166
He gets the girl.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.091
You get what you get.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.529
Jack!

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.410
Doreen?

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.841
Hey.

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.241
Hey.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.804
I saw that.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.441
Caught.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.689
What happened to your face?

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.250
A couple of guys jumped
me on the elevator.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.560
Really?

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.451
No, I...

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.408
No, I slipped, you know?

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.730
It happens sometimes when
you get older, you know?

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.645
Your ticket for your Mustang.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.928
I got it downstairs.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.607
You probably should
be getting back now.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.925
What are you gonna do?

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.760
Well, I'm gonna be
taking off today.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:53.401
Why?

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.963
It just worked out that way.

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.646
For good?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.331
For a while.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.965
Doreen, before I go, I just...

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.926
want to tell you I think you're
a special girl. I mean that.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.449
In just 48 hours...

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:35.965
I could see that.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.208
Just, things happen to us,
Doreen, you know?

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.164
We make mistakes.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.123
We fall down and...

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.723
we get into trouble. It happens
to everybody. It does.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.646
But it doesn't mean...

01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.403
everything that happened yesterday
has to happen every day. It doesn't.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:12.882
You don't want to do it like me and
spend your whole life looking back.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.567
You know, it is what it is.
We can't change our history.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.808
We can't do that, I mean...

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.361
But you can go past it.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.801
Just...

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.684
right past it.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.809
And, you know, up ahead...

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.685
it's all new.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.162
It's new. It's yours
if you want it.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.601
I tell you, your mother loves you.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.127
No matter what you think,
she loves you.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.126
Maybe you got things you have
to talk to her about or some...

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.401
problems, whatever.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.127
You should talk to her.
She'll listen.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.362
I don't know what happened.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.125
He, uh...

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.688
He worked with dad.
He was always really nice.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.124
I thought I, um...

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.924
I thought I...

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.485
I mean...

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.887
I thought it was gonna be cool.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.009
Fun, you know?

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.050
We, uh...

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.170
We had some...

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.371
We had some champagne
and, uh, he asked if I...

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.369
wanted to go to this party.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.280
You should have seen
my friends' faces.

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:18.968
I don't even remember
what happened.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.041
I just remember...

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.048
not being able to move much.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:33.449
I remember, um...

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.124
wanting to leave.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.484
Wanting it to stop.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.411
Wanting to...

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.329
go home.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.287
- It's all my fault.
- No.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.003
It's not your fault.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.563
None of this is your fault.

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:13.809
You gotta believe that.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.764
No, no, no, no.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.691
None of this is
your fault None of it.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.758
- Yeah.
- <i>Jack?</i>

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.569
- Who is this?
- <i>It's Geraldine.</i>

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.280
<i>I didn't know she was
Richie's daughter.</i>

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.326
<i>When I found out who she was,
I got the disc to Richie right away.</i>

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.761
<i>I didn't know what he'd do with it.</i>

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.648
<i>He told them he was taking
the disc to the cops.</i>

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.291
<i>Cyrus knows I gave him the disc.</i>

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.884
<i>He's on his way here.
He's coming over now, Jack!</i>

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.811
<i>I didn't know who
to call. I was just...</i>

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.287
<i>Shit! I'm sorry.</i>

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.968
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.687
- Where's Eddie?
- He's not working today.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.848
- Where's he live?
- What's going on?

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.525
- Where does he live?
- Jack.

01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:14.920
Will you listen to me?
For just a minute.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.086
I've been in it all my life,
on both sides of the ocean.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:22.523
If you get mixed up in whatever
your brother was into...

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.691
you got a good chance of winding
up exactly the same as he did.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.248
And those two ladies will go
into mourning all over again.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.486
Now, I can't tell you what
to do, but I can tell you this:

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.370
Getting yourself killed
won't bring Richie back.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.289
Revenge doesn't work.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:45.004
Sure it does.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.081
- They knew what they were getting...
- Don't play me!

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:03.602
That was Cyrus' deal, man!

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.486
He probably killed
your brother, right?

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.210
It wasn't fucking me!

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.129
He's at a party right now...

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.608
at some fucking club
with Kinnear, all right?

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.531
I was just fucking playing around!

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.561
Go get them.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.524
I'm having a hard time
understanding something.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.529
What could she have done to you...

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.121
that was so bad that you'd
do this to her? Hmm?

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.846
Because what you did
doesn't go away!

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:35.726
She trusted you, and you raped her.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:39.324
She was my brother's
daughter. My family.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.770
And it's my fault.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.361
Because if I had been here,
this never would have gone down.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.324
So now I gotta make
it right. I gotta do that.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.530
I mean, what would you do
if it was your daughter?

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.605
Jack, don't kill me, man.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.006
You killed yourself.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.567
Jack, stop!

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.689
Hey! Hey!

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.202
Get him! Go, go, go!

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.840
Jack!

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.724
Jack, stop!

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.765
Goddamn it!

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.765
Motherfucker!

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.044
Oh, fuck!

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.289
Don't lose him.

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.926
Straight on.

01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:56.927
You're dead!

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.205
Just get on him.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.810
You cocksucker!

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.242
Come on, come on, come on!

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:43.162
Drive, drive, go!

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.210
Where is he?

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.444
Man, Jack!

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.321
Here you go!

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.806
Don't turn!

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.206
Is this what you want?

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.890
Oh, shit!

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.488
Sorry, Mr. Carter.
You're not on the list.

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.930
Nobody likes the list guy.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.041
Hey.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.522
Can I help you with something?

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.330
I don't think so.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.329
Jeremy Kinnear.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.327
Look, Mr. Phone Guy, do you
have any idea who I am?

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:47.331
I'll buy your goddamn
hotel so I can fire you!

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.803
I want to talk to Mr. Fletcher.
Les Fletcher.

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:55.809
You listen to me, you neophyte toady.
I am in the middle of a party here.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.971
I should not have to deal with this.
Put me through to your boss!

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:36.769
Listen, why don't you girls
go in the back room?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.570
I'll meet you back there.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:41.127
I've got some things
to take care of.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.448
Did you know who she was?

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.884
- Excuse me?
- Did you knew she was my blood?

01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:58.971
Jack, are we gonna go through
this goddamn little dance again?

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.046
Go ahead.

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:05.041
Take out your gun in front
of all these people here.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.969
Put one right between my eyes.

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.249
You couldn't handle jail
for the rest of your life.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.244
I want to tell you something.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.644
The man you want...

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.522
is that little piss-ass Kinnear.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:22.931
Him and the old guy, so stop
breaking my balls, all right?

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:27.326
I'm a goddamn businessman trying
to stay afloat, just like you.

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.369
You're nothing like me.

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:35.246
Excuse me, wait a minute, Jack.
All of a sudden you care?

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.411
All of a sudden, what are you?
Some kind of fucking good guy?

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.649
- You're the bad brother, remember?
- I know who I am.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.451
I would love to sit here
and jaw with you...

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.081
but I gotta get back to the talent.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.442
Hey, uh, Jack.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.807
Let it go.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:28.845
Come on, Jack, let's
see what you got.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.842
Hey, hey, hey, Jack, come on.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:58.164
Goddamn, Jack.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:01.330
Your little brother put up
a better fight than you.

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.401
You should finish what you start.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.366
Yeah. Hey, you should fix
your tie a little bit there.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.364
Have a good time.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.249
Where is it, Richie?

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.809
You got a car?

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:36.164
Let's take a ride.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:48.850
Where are we going?

01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:52.890
Hey. Slow down! Turn the
lights back on, please.

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.488
- Come on.
- It's not my problem.

01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.967
I didn't do it.

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.961
Slow down, please.
You're gonna kill us.

01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.246
Please!

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:09.206
What do you want?
You want a clean slate?

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.971
Give me five minutes
in front of a laptop.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:15.607
- Slow down, you're gonna kill us!
- That's the point, Jeremy.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.725
Okay. You want money?

01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:24.965
Name your price. I've got
more money than God!

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.531
You need a drink.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.165
It's okay.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.126
It's all right.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.525
Is this how you did
it to Richie, huh?

01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:01.770
This how you did it, Jeremy, huh?

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:04.608
You think he screamed too?

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:05.847
You like it?

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.771
I didn't kill your brother,
Mr. Carter!

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.081
<i>Get up.</i>

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.721
- You're making a mistake.
- Get up. Move!

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.922
Listen, you're making a mistake.

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:23.808
Cyrus told me your brother was gonna
go to the police with this disc.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:27.123
He said if he went down,
I'd go down, okay?

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.281
I didn't know what
to do, Mr. Carter.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.129
- So you had him killed.
- No!

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.369
I just told him to get the
disc back, that's all.

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.928
I had nothing to do with it.
I told Cyrus to get the disc.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.446
I said to get the disc...

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:44.682
and our business would be over.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.724
That's all. Mr. Carter,
I swear to you!

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.888
I swear I didn't do anything.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:53.004
I didn't kill him, Mr. Carter.
Please believe me!

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.720
He said if I said anything...

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.769
he would ruin me!

01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:00.042
And then you came...

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.169
You came along and...

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.805
Please, Mr. Carter!
Please. It was Cyrus!

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.328
He killed your brother
and Geraldine, not me.

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.807
He said he was working
with some guy.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:15.486
- They did it.
- No more talk.

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:24.764
Turn around.

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.369
- Please, don't.
- Turn around.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.002
Be a man for once in your life.

01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:15.962
I'm gonna do something for you...

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:19.722
nobody ever did for me.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.520
I'm gonna give you a second chance.

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:29.922
Please don't make me come back.

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.606
No.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.326
I won't, Mr. Carter. Thank you.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:38.286
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.201
I promise I won't
make you come back.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.891
Thank you.

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:02.881
Hey.

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.766
What are you doing?

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:14.160
Sorry, Jack.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:18.524
I don't usually, uh, get my hands
dirty, but I checked your room...

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:20.603
and there was nothing there.

01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.088
Listen. About this...

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.520
Doreen thing.

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.762
She'll be all right, I think.

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.769
Kids are resilient, you know?

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:37.731
And, uh, this thing with Richie, I mean,
Christ, that was bloody awful.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.404
I don't know what Cyrus was thinking,
but a man's got to make a living.

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:46.770
I tried to keep you out...

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:50.806
but you insisted on this
<i>post facto</i> big-brother thing.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.411
So I figured...

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.489
if I left enough dangling...

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:57.160
you would find my disc for me.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.130
What a mess, eh?

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.846
All over a shiny piece of plastic.

01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:10.000
Listen.

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.523
I'll get rid of the disc.

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.566
You got rid of
everything else, so...

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.725
You may have hardware
concealed about your person.

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.566
But remember:

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:32.367
You kill me, you'll be on the
run for the rest of your life.

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.888
It's been nice knowing you, Jack.

01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:44.246
Brumby.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.283
I'm not turning around.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.487
Suit yourself.

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:22.404
Uncle Jack.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.527
Your mother told me
I'd find you here.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.245
- I thought you were gone.
- I am gone. I just wanted to...

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:32.562
say goodbye to you, face to face.

01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:39.724
- What happened to your beard thing?
- Oh, that?

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:45.562
I thought it was time for a
change. I just got rid of it.

01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.844
Did you fall again?

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.566
This?

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.888
Yeah, I did. I fell down again.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.530
I'll get new shoes.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:05.770
We'll be okay, you know.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.285
Mom and me.

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:09.966
I know.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:14.643
Thanks for being here.
It would've meant a lot to Dad.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.048
- He was a good man.
- Yeah.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.880
Guess you gotta go?

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.241
Yeah.

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.481
Remember when
I said you're special?

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:37.287
You better remember or you'll
have a big problem with me.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:40.527
Okay.

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:49.843
Take care of yourself, Doreen.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.081
You too.

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.367
Hey.

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.450
I like the new look.

01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:08.366
Yeah.
