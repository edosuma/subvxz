WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:01.925
Previously on SEAL Team...
BRIAN: Come on, man,

00:01.960 --> 00:04.724
you got to shake this off.

00:04.770 --> 00:07.159
CLAY: Look, most of the guys
in our selection class just put

00:07.200 --> 00:10.101
my name on a list of guys that
they think don't belong here.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.438
The guys only listed you 'cause
of the way you've been acting

00:12.480 --> 00:13.799
since the second we got here.
CLAY: _
You were Just trying

00:13.840 --> 00:15.728
to help, and I was
kind of being a click,

00:15.780 --> 00:17.600
the other night,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.

00:17.650 --> 00:20.039
Get out of here, man.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.638
Nate was hiding a burner
phone from his wife.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.580
You think because Nate had a
phone, he was cheating on Molly?

00:23.620 --> 00:25.747
All the calls
are to and from one number.

00:27.290 --> 00:28.757
JASON: As far as Nate's
burner phone is concerned,

00:28.790 --> 00:31.054
there's no good way to access
the location history,

00:31.090 --> 00:34.025
so that's a dead end.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.693
(lively Latin music playing)

00:41.140 --> 00:43.631
WOMAN:
Thanks for the offer, but
I think we're gonna head out.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.331
There's a party
at the German consulate.

00:45.370 --> 00:47.509
I promised I'd stop by, so...

00:47.540 --> 00:50.668
Oh, come on, Hannah, what do
the Germans have that we don't?
Blergartens,

00:50.710 --> 00:52.314
nationalized health care,
a true appreciation

00:52.350 --> 00:54.318
for the many talents
of David Hasselhoff.

00:54.350 --> 00:56.318
You know what your problem is?
You're not drunk enough.

00:56.350 --> 00:57.487
Stay-stay right here.
No, Richard,

00:57.520 --> 00:58.509
really, I'm...
No, no. Tony.

00:58.550 --> 00:59.710
Two G and Ts.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.819
Top shelf?
Yeah, the good stuff.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.555
Mr. Crowley.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.785
Mr. Bol.
Thought you might
care to comment

01:05.830 --> 01:07.354
on the story I'm about to file.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.095
_ It seems that
election monitors up north

01:09.130 --> 01:10.768
are reporting widespread fraud.
Mr. Bol,

01:10.800 --> 01:12.358
we just pulled off
this country's

01:12.400 --> 01:13.867
first presidential election.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.834
I'm gonna call that a victory.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.633
And by "we," you mean...?

01:17.670 --> 01:20.377
I will leave that up
to your interpretation.

01:20.410 --> 01:21.377
Here you are, sir.

01:21.410 --> 01:22.843
Ah, yes. Thank you.

01:22.880 --> 01:24.541
(quietly):
Off the record.

01:24.580 --> 01:25.842
Off the record?

01:25.880 --> 01:29.145
I am... about
two seconds away

01:29.190 --> 01:32.159
from bagging the
hottest NGO worker

01:32.190 --> 01:33.282
in all of South Sudan.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.288
So, if you
don't mind...

01:35.320 --> 01:37.754
I find that
very hard to believe.

01:41.860 --> 01:43.589
HANNAH:
Thanks for the ride.

01:43.630 --> 01:44.892
DRIVER:
Oh, Hannah.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.898
I'd love to have seen
Crowley's face

01:46.940 --> 01:49.238
when he found you gone.
Oh, don't be cruel.

01:49.270 --> 01:52.774
I'm sorry, my friend, but the
ambassador brings it out in me.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.232
Acting ambassador.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.475
(both laugh)

01:57.810 --> 01:59.812
DRIVER: It's only
only a tollbooth.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.579
Do you have a ten-pound note?

02:01.620 --> 02:03.178
The toll is ten pounds?

02:03.220 --> 02:05.688
That's the price
for your white face.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.154
Get out of the truck.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.656
DRIVER:
We have papers, brother.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.861
We are not to be detained.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.197
This is for your trouble.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.434
Out! I said, out of the car.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.529
Whoa. We are on the same side.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.179
Get out.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.379
(shouting)

02:31.410 --> 02:32.843
(punching, kicking)

02:32.880 --> 02:34.541
Leave him alone.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.218
(grunts)

02:42.490 --> 02:44.481
(helicopter blades whirring
in distance)

02:47.600 --> 02:49.363
Oh. What's up, man?

02:49.400 --> 02:54.269
What's up is another
healthy dish of chicken.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.200
Organic.
(both laugh)

02:56.240 --> 02:57.707
Hey.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.231
Thought maybe you'd want
to take a look at these.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.544
Nate's old pics.

03:02.580 --> 03:05.845
Finally get around to cleaning
out Nate's cage, huh?

03:05.880 --> 03:07.609
Oh, no. I was helping
Alana clean out

03:07.650 --> 03:09.914
Nate and Molly's house before
it goes on the market.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.838
Little trip down
memory lane there.

03:11.890 --> 03:13.517
Nate and our interpreter Marjan.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.959
Feels like it's kind of bad luck

03:14.990 --> 03:16.355
to be in a photo
with two dead guys.

03:16.390 --> 03:18.358
What about the woman there?

03:18.390 --> 03:21.359
Okay. Two dead guys
and a dead woman.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.220
Thanks for that.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.396
What makes you think she's dead?

03:24.430 --> 03:27.888
Well, the Taliban went
after our interpreter.

03:27.940 --> 03:30.704
You know, don't you think
they'd go after his wife, too?

03:30.740 --> 03:34.232
Huh? I mean,
you know how they do.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.305
That is Marjan's wife?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.978
Imean "
, was."

03:39.010 --> 03:40.978
Speaking of Nate's cage...

03:41.020 --> 03:44.512
It is about time that you got
around to cleaning it out.

03:44.550 --> 03:46.256
Yeah.
Deal with his burn box.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.019
Yeah.
Yeah.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.654
The man's gone.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.294
And he has every right

03:52.330 --> 03:53.422
for his secrets
to be gone with him, too.

03:53.460 --> 03:54.529
Yeah.
Okay?

03:54.560 --> 03:55.595
Right. You know,

03:55.630 --> 03:57.518
I'm-I'm gonna get to it, right?

03:57.570 --> 03:59.959
Hey. It's not gonna
get any easier.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.991
You've got to rip
that Band-Aid off.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.938
Yeah.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.675
What are you doing?
Hmm?

04:08.710 --> 04:10.644
I mean, you're-you're
eating in order right now.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.272
You're going... you're going
meat, rice, green beans,

04:12.320 --> 04:13.048
meat, rice, green beans,

04:13.080 --> 04:14.342
meat, rice,
green beans.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.348
Mm-hmm. It's efficient.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.039
And strangely satisfying.

04:18.090 --> 04:19.682
Yeah, if you have violent OCD.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.914
(laughs)

04:20.960 --> 04:22.325
You know how many CEOs have OCD?

04:22.360 --> 04:23.327
A lot.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.578
Gaughs)
ADAM:
Spensen

04:25.630 --> 04:28.793
Gate security says
you have a visitor.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.597
When's it turn into stalking?

04:35.640 --> 04:38.609
Well, I was
in the neighborhood.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.938
You know you're violating
my safe space.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.447
Sounds dirty.
(chuckles)

04:42.480 --> 04:45.847
It's a good thing one
of us is having fun.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.347
That's actually why I'm here.

04:47.380 --> 04:49.348
We're throwing
a party this weekend,

04:49.390 --> 04:50.789
me and my roommates.

04:50.820 --> 04:52.811
And you're inviting me
to this party?

04:52.860 --> 04:54.054
No, I'm just keeping you
up to date.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.325
Can I bring a guest?
Uh...

04:58.360 --> 05:00.897
As long as they have a Y
chromosome, yeah, you should...

05:00.930 --> 05:02.522
It's, uh, it's my buddy Brian.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.094
You've seen him at the bar.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.768
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the cute one.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.529
Absolutely. Bring-bring Brian.

05:07.570 --> 05:09.435
Hmm. Actually, you know what?
On second thought...

05:09.470 --> 05:11.062
(laughs)
Is this, uh...

05:11.110 --> 05:12.907
So is this where
the magic happens?

05:12.940 --> 05:14.931
Uh, I mean, it's...

05:14.980 --> 05:17.949
not quite Hogwarts, but, yeah.

05:17.980 --> 05:21.040
It's nice to see you
in your element.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.839
See you at the party.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.751
(sighs)

05:45.610 --> 05:48.329
*

06:03.490 --> 06:06.493
Huh, "Jason Hayes."

06:26.210 --> 06:29.441
What the hell
were you doing, Nate?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.085
We've been talking all week
about what might happen

06:35.120 --> 06:36.929
if the violence
in South Sudan continues

06:36.960 --> 06:38.723
to escalate after the elections.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.888
As discussed, the election
was marked by widespread fraud.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.727
A lot of people in the
opposition are blaming us.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.761
What did we do?

06:45.800 --> 06:47.438
What, in Africa?
Yeah.

06:48.940 --> 06:52.637
to the rural areas up north,
but it's spreading.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.137
Hannah Parsons was an American
NGO worker in South Sudan.

06:55.180 --> 06:58.445
She and her driver
were murdered last night

06:58.480 --> 07:00.869
by an anti-government
tribal militia.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.478
Just outside of Juba.

07:02.520 --> 07:03.942
Six miles from
the American embassy.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.982
Okay. So you want us
to evacuate the embassy?

07:07.020 --> 07:09.659
So far, just of
nonessential personnel.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.227
There's 35 Americans
still in that embassy.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.693
We're going in to keep them safe

07:13.730 --> 07:15.527
while they try
to hold the place together.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.563
Then we get them out,
things go the other way.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.828
RAY:
Or, so...

07:19.870 --> 07:21.132
after it goes Benghazi,
the DoD can say

07:21.170 --> 07:22.899
they had a Tier One team
on the ground.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.567
Why not just bring in
a couple hundred Marines,

07:24.610 --> 07:26.532
Expeditionary Unit?

07:26.580 --> 07:28.707
Problem is, so far, the ruling
party's rejected our offer

07:28.740 --> 07:30.207
to send in a MEU.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.741
They feel it gives the
appearance they've lost control.

07:32.780 --> 07:35.044
Well, we wouldn't want
to give that appearance.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.052
DAVIS: Your vehicles
got armor everthere

07:42.090 --> 07:43.978
except for the windows,
'cause you say they needed
to roll down.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.588
Oh, look, if you can't
put the windows down,

07:45.630 --> 07:47.655
people are gonna know
it's an armored car.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.066
Anyway, the body
should stop an AK round.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.897
Your precious roll-down windows
are liable to shatter

07:51.930 --> 07:53.898
if one of the local kids
hits it with a baseball.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.534
We're diverting.
What do you mean
"we're diverting"?

07:56.570 --> 07:58.709
Airport's not secure.
Command wants us to land

07:58.740 --> 08:02.232
at an old military airfield
southeast of the city.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.101
Wants me to stay there,
coordinate with the Marine C.O.,

08:05.150 --> 08:07.118
make sure that the runways
stay operational

08:07.150 --> 08:09.243
in case we all need to get out
of this country in a hurry.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.919
I'll find out what assets
we have down there.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.110
All right.
What's the local security like?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.513
MANDY:
Notgood.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.356
But the State Department RSO

08:15.390 --> 08:16.823
on the other hand's
got a good rep.

08:16.860 --> 08:18.225
His name's Doyle.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.148
Bunch of people I know
worked with him in Tunis.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.758
What about the ambo?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.018
Crowley. Technically,
he's not the ambo,

08:24.070 --> 08:25.924
he's acting ambassador until
a new one gets appointed.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.232
BLACKBURN: All right.
What can you tell us

08:27.270 --> 08:28.999
about Crowley?
Well, our analysts think

08:29.040 --> 08:30.667
he should've ordered
the evac already.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.634
Shutter the embassy, stay away
until things stabilize.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.170
The good news is, so far,

08:35.210 --> 08:37.872
the anger hasn't been focused
on the embassy.

08:37.910 --> 08:40.549
Bad news is, that's the kind of
thing can change real quick.

08:40.580 --> 08:42.047
Yeah.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.896
RADIO HOST: This is the
American-Sudanese Radio Network.

09:00.940 --> 09:01.998
South Sudanese rebel leaders say

09:02.040 --> 09:05.134
recent presidential election
results are fraudulent,

09:05.170 --> 09:06.330
and blame the US. for meddling.

09:06.370 --> 09:09.134
They are calling
for nationwide protests

09:09.180 --> 09:11.944
and an ouster
of President Salva Kiir.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.868
DOYLE:
Lawrence Doyle, RSO.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.868
Welcome to the US. embassy.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.775
Roadblocks
in the rural areas

09:39.810 --> 09:41.869
have started to disrupt
distribution networks.

09:41.910 --> 09:44.049
We're already looking
at food shortages.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.342
JASON: How long?
DOYLE:
Till it all falls apart?

09:45.380 --> 09:47.041
It depends who you ask.

09:47.080 --> 09:48.741
This country's
only existed a few years.

09:48.780 --> 09:50.645
Been at civil war
most of that time.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.089
Plus, the nut-bars
in charge up north

09:52.120 --> 09:54.111
are just looking for a
chance to take it all back,

09:54.160 --> 09:55.889
reunify the Sudanese nation.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.922
"And, one day, inshallah,
the entire nation of Nubia."

09:57.960 --> 09:59.120
Somebody follows the news.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.094
Might even say it's my job.

10:01.130 --> 10:03.598
(indistinct radio transmission)

10:05.200 --> 10:06.736
I'm glad you're here.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.897
This place
is going south fast.

10:08.940 --> 10:10.908
I got a team of three,
including myself.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.670
"Regional security officer"
for a region the size of Texas,

10:13.710 --> 10:14.904
and I have two deputies.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.942
Still got 157 Americans

10:16.980 --> 10:18.902
scattered across this
godforsaken country.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.770
This will be a miracle,
we get 'em all out.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.981
All right.
So how can we help your team?

10:23.020 --> 10:25.409
Get Crowley to make the
evacuation order mandatory.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.987
No one's gonna take it seriously
till he does.

10:28.020 --> 10:29.248
All right.
So he's not gonna make the evac

10:29.290 --> 10:30.325
till the bitter end?
Shutting down
the embassy

10:30.360 --> 10:32.692
_ is a failure _
of diplomatic missmn.

10:32.730 --> 10:34.322
And in this case,
it'll be his failure.

10:34.360 --> 10:39.195
Weigh that against
a little thing like 157 lives.

10:39.230 --> 10:41.960
PROTESTERS (chanting):
Go home! Go home! Go home!

10:42.000 --> 10:44.662
Go home!
Go home! Go home!

10:44.710 --> 10:47.235
Go home! Go home! Go home!

10:47.280 --> 10:49.874
(chanting continues outside)

10:56.750 --> 10:59.218
We've got protesters
gathering outside the embassy.

10:59.250 --> 11:02.083
We're setting up an observation
post to keep an eye on 'em.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.326
MANDY:
Copy. Keep me posted.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.386
Go home! Go home!
Go home! Go home!

11:06.430 --> 11:08.193
Go home!
Go home!

11:08.230 --> 11:10.266
Go home! Go home!

11:10.300 --> 11:13.189
Go home! Go home! Go home!

11:13.240 --> 11:15.196
Go home! Go home!

11:15.240 --> 11:17.162
DOYLE:
Here's Crowley.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.768
Welcome, Lieutenant.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.277
Uh, I'm sure
Mr. Doyle...

11:20.310 --> 11:21.800
Master Chief.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.704
Excuse me?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.149
I'm in E-9.

11:24.180 --> 11:25.374
Uh, you're not an officer?

11:25.410 --> 11:26.968
Sorry to disappoint.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.045
Uh, as I was saying, uh,

11:29.080 --> 11:31.048
Mr. Doyle here can
find work for you.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.183
The regional security
officer is, after all,

11:33.220 --> 11:35.381
responsible for our
security matters.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.980
Right, Mr. Ambassador, but
you are the man in charge here.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.294
That makes you responsible
for everything.

11:40.330 --> 11:42.457
Don't I know it?

11:42.500 --> 11:44.297
Shall we?

11:47.770 --> 11:50.238
Go home! Go home! Go home!

11:50.270 --> 11:53.239
Go home! Go home!
Go home! Go home!

11:53.280 --> 11:55.236
MAN: If this was Beirut,
we would have been out

11:55.280 --> 11:56.508
two days ago.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.201
Why we get danger pay.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.219
We can't just pack up and leave
every time there's a protest.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.286
We leave, we send
a message that

12:03.320 --> 12:05.083
democracy's failed.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.054
I'm not ready
to pull down the flag just yet.

12:07.090 --> 12:08.751
Well, you wait long enough,

12:08.790 --> 12:10.519
they'll come here
and pull it down for you.
Dan,

12:10.560 --> 12:12.448
how many times have
we seen this stuff

12:12.490 --> 12:14.219
bubble up and die back down?

12:14.260 --> 12:15.921
Why don't you just
restrict self-driving

12:15.960 --> 12:19.521
till things die back down again,
like you mentioned?

12:19.570 --> 12:22.334
Well, Lieutenant, uh...

12:22.370 --> 12:24.258
Sorry. Chief.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.460
Uh, here in Juba,
we don't like to send

12:26.510 --> 12:29.229
a message that it's dangerous
to move freely in the streets.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.204
So, your security protocol is,
pretend everything's okay?

12:32.250 --> 12:33.478
Our security protocol,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.409
at the moment,
is to bring in a team

12:36.450 --> 12:40.910
of special operators to ensure
that things remain okay.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.383
Well, just so we're clear,
we have five shooters,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.250
including myself,
and we're really good,

12:45.290 --> 12:47.394
but we can't stop a civil war.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.425
I know we're supposed
to admire a man

12:52.470 --> 12:55.359
for admitting his limitations,

12:55.400 --> 12:59.234
but I'd always rather see
someone transcend them.

12:59.270 --> 13:03.343
Thank you, Chief. Now,
uh, as I was saying...

13:03.380 --> 13:07.339
Appreciate the effort.
Well, you can't shame
a guy who's got no shame.

13:07.380 --> 13:10.838
(phone chimes)
...legitimate concern is
that we not be seen

13:10.890 --> 13:12.289
as overreacting.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.480
Panic's never
a tool, so...

13:13.520 --> 13:15.317
Some teachers stuck

13:15.360 --> 13:16.850
at the American School.
Need some help?

13:16.890 --> 13:19.358
Won't say no.
Let's go.

13:19.390 --> 13:21.324
I'm sorry. Uh,

13:21.360 --> 13:22.861
where exactly are
you gentlemen going?

13:22.900 --> 13:24.322
We have some business
at the American School.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.861
I didn't authorize that.
But you're okay with us

13:26.900 --> 13:29.198
saving three
American teachers?

13:31.410 --> 13:32.832
Yeah, I thought so.

13:40.050 --> 13:41.176
What?

13:41.220 --> 13:42.312
Nice shirt.

13:42.350 --> 13:43.840
What's wrong with this shirt?

13:43.890 --> 13:45.482
Did I say it was
a costume party?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.056
I happen
to love this shirt.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.387
This is my good-luck shirt.

13:48.420 --> 13:49.956
Good luck with what?

13:49.990 --> 13:52.356
My mom got it for me
when we went to Montana

13:52.390 --> 13:55.450
to bury my papaw, so now
don't you feel like a jerk?

13:55.500 --> 13:57.968
Your "papaw"?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.422
Do not talk about Papaw.

13:59.470 --> 14:01.199
No. No, indeed.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.367
(sighs) You know anything
about Stella's friends?

14:03.410 --> 14:05.366
Not really.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.503
Figure they're probably
all grad students, too.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.531
I'd stand to reason.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.344
This is a mistake.

14:12.380 --> 14:14.245
Probably.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.542
(Brian laughs)

14:15.580 --> 14:19.380
Go home, go home, go home!

14:19.420 --> 14:22.480
Go home, go home,
go home!

14:22.520 --> 14:24.488
Go home, go home!

14:24.530 --> 14:26.452
Go home,
go home!

14:26.490 --> 14:28.094
(chanting continues faintly)

14:28.130 --> 14:29.529
Stefan Bol.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.289
You mind if I ask
you some questions?

14:31.330 --> 14:33.139
Oh, you're a reporter?
What gave it away?

14:33.170 --> 14:34.637
Can't do it. Nothing personal.

14:34.670 --> 14:39.130
I'm also, uh, willing to go
off the clock a while.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.229
Just big guy lying low

14:41.280 --> 14:43.248
while the brothers outside
blow off some steam.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.169
Those your brothers, huh?

14:46.210 --> 14:48.417
Yours, too.

14:48.450 --> 14:52.113
You know there's people out
there that will slit our throats

14:52.150 --> 14:54.152
just because of the color
of our passports, right?

14:57.460 --> 15:00.395
Never bothers you?
Show up in a place like this,

15:00.430 --> 15:02.318
alongside all them
big white boys...

15:02.360 --> 15:04.521
Watch your mouth.
Anybody else
looks like you

15:04.570 --> 15:06.367
is on the other side
of your guns.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.460
Time for you to go.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.663
Trust me, I am
not the one.

15:12.710 --> 15:15.304
(chanting continues faintly)

15:18.610 --> 15:21.408
And those big white boys
you're talking about?

15:21.450 --> 15:23.509
They're my brothers, too.

15:23.550 --> 15:28.283
Only colors that matter are
the, um, red, white and blue?

15:28.320 --> 15:31.084
Kumbaya.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.290
Hey.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.093
Did we rig it?

15:38.130 --> 15:39.529
The election.

15:39.570 --> 15:42.437
"We"? Um,
I honestly don't know.

15:42.470 --> 15:45.530
People outside
seem to think so.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.573
Yeah, well, someone here was
gonna end up accusing us

15:48.610 --> 15:50.373
no matter what we did.

15:50.410 --> 15:51.604
Just because they didn't like
the way the vote turned out,

15:51.650 --> 15:53.242
looking for someone to blame.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.382
We're two minutes out
from the American School.

15:59.420 --> 16:00.489
Any resistance?

16:00.520 --> 16:01.987
Not so far.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.521
Anything I need to know?

16:03.560 --> 16:05.050
MANDY: Hearing anti-government
propaganda on the radio.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.320
Seems the rebels have
taken over the station.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.351
No change in the evac status?

16:09.400 --> 16:11.425
Crowley still won't
give the order.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.031
(indistinct shouting)

16:20.180 --> 16:22.000
What's the rules of engagement?

16:22.040 --> 16:23.473
We don't speak unless spoken to.

16:23.510 --> 16:25.569
Guy wants to raise up, kill him.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.687
I didn't get to say hello.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.555
(men shouting)

16:41.260 --> 16:44.627
Okay. Set a perimeter.

17:06.220 --> 17:08.654
(faint shouting in distance)

17:20.700 --> 17:22.497
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
We're US. military, ma'am.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.837
We got everybody out,

17:23.870 --> 17:26.600
but we were trapped inside.
Okay.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.676
We got you.

17:28.710 --> 17:31.201
We're gonna get you out of here.
Let's go.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.672
We'll take it from here, make
sure they get to the airport.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.644
Right. You want us on your six?

17:34.680 --> 17:36.671
No, so far, the airport
road is still clear.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.642
Crowley's got a job
he wants you on.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.318
He wants you to evac two
American aid workers.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.351
He figured he'd send the pipe
hitters to bring 'em home.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.688
Might be the first
good decision he's made.

17:45.730 --> 17:48.096
(dance music playing)

17:52.630 --> 17:56.839
(coughs) All right, yeah.

17:56.870 --> 17:59.600
The, uh, the
American snipers?

17:59.640 --> 18:00.572
Wow.
STELLA: Hey.

18:00.610 --> 18:02.100
Hi, Brian.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.641
Clay, this is Evan.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.568
Evan, stop it.

18:05.610 --> 18:07.840
Everybody behave, please.
No, you worry too much. No, no.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.677
My new friends and I, we don't
start fights at parties.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.449
We're evolved.
Isn't that right, friends?

18:11.490 --> 18:13.378
Ah, this is your show, man.
You tell us.

18:13.420 --> 18:14.284
These are my guests.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.550
If you can't behave
like a human being...

18:16.590 --> 18:18.683
All right, they're your guests,
but if they weren't,

18:18.730 --> 18:20.652
they could always just
knock down the door

18:20.700 --> 18:22.292
and take whatever they want.
What they're trained for.

18:22.330 --> 18:23.888
Actually, most
of our training

18:23.930 --> 18:26.319
is just about balancing beach
balls on our noses, so...

18:26.370 --> 18:28.588
Is this, uh, really
what you want?

18:28.640 --> 18:30.801
After everything I've heard you
say about American militarism,

18:30.840 --> 18:33.707
this regressive,
cartoon masculinity?

18:33.740 --> 18:35.628
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention
that I'm really against

18:35.680 --> 18:38.706
American militarism and _
regresswe, cartoon masculinity.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.899
Me, too.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.645
Oh, good. Bullet dodged.

18:48.690 --> 18:50.328
We're approaching
the checkpoint.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.282
MANDY:
Copy.

18:52.330 --> 18:54.753
Be advised, rebels have been
taking over checkpoints,

18:54.800 --> 18:55.789
but even the officers
in the National Army

18:55.830 --> 18:56.819
tend to switch side

18:56.860 --> 18:58.521
when the weather changes.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.197
Copy that. Thanks
for the warning.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.832
I thought the army
was on our side.

19:01.870 --> 19:04.532
JASON:
Heads on a swivel, boys.

19:04.570 --> 19:06.731
Don't know how friendly
these guys are gonna be.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.775
SONNY:
That DShK right there

19:13.820 --> 19:15.173
is gonna rip this thing
to shreds.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.517
I'll frag it.
All right, guys.

19:16.550 --> 19:18.188
Let's just try
and look friendly.

19:18.220 --> 19:19.642
I'm always friendly.

19:24.860 --> 19:25.849
(speaking foreign language)

19:27.860 --> 19:29.748
Inspection. Everyone out.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.519
I'm sorry. That's not
gonna happen, boss.

19:32.570 --> 19:33.798
Inspection!

19:33.840 --> 19:36.729
Sorry, we can't do that.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.305
Are you insane, sir?

19:42.340 --> 19:44.240
Do you want to die here?

19:44.280 --> 19:47.545
Can you lean in?
I want to show you something.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.845
Come on, I know
I can't do anything.

19:50.890 --> 19:54.712
That machine gunner there is
gonna turn me into pink mist.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.751
Come on, take a look in.
I want to show you something.

19:58.790 --> 20:01.190
Look down.

20:04.430 --> 20:08.764
That's a full mag from an MP7
pointed straight at your waist.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.509
Now, I know as soon
as the shooting starts,

20:12.540 --> 20:15.338
that DShK is gonna
tear us to pieces.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.733
But what I want you to know,

20:16.780 --> 20:19.749
whatever else happens,
you'll die.

20:19.780 --> 20:22.613
Maybe you'll last a couple hours
with your balls blown off

20:22.650 --> 20:24.641
and your guts hanging
out of your stomach.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.989
Personally, I'd rather
be vaporized by the DShk.

20:28.020 --> 20:30.420
Nobody wins.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.655
So, what do you say
we give peace a chance?

20:37.530 --> 20:38.963
Stand back, boys.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.865
Lower your weapons.

20:40.900 --> 20:43.539
(speaks foreign language)

20:43.570 --> 20:44.935
John Lennon, yes?

21:11.830 --> 21:13.058
Erik Wilkenson.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.897
What can I do for you gentlemen?

21:14.940 --> 21:16.635
Here to take you and your wife
out of the country.

21:16.670 --> 21:18.035
Take us out? Where?

21:18.070 --> 21:19.537
Out of the country.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.902
I see. No.

21:21.940 --> 21:22.531
I'm sorry?

21:22.580 --> 21:24.878
This country is our home.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.548
This is my wife, Samiyya.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.070
She designed the irrigation
system we're installing.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.542
Your-your father
sent them?

21:29.580 --> 21:31.013
No, the American embassy
sent us.

21:31.050 --> 21:33.382
Acting on the orders
of my father-in-law.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.888
Selfish of him,
but he's a selfish man.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.922
Your father gives orders
to the State Department?

21:37.960 --> 21:39.427
And they follow them.

21:39.460 --> 21:40.893
ERIK:
I'm truly sorry.

21:40.930 --> 21:42.727
You wasted your
time coming here.

21:42.760 --> 21:43.863
Crowley should've told you.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.027
Told us what?
No reason to come here,

21:46.070 --> 21:47.890
that we wouldn't leave.
You talked to him?

21:47.940 --> 21:49.339
Just a few hours ago.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.668
He talked to...
So...

21:51.710 --> 21:53.678
you told Crowley that you
weren't gonna be evacuated

21:53.710 --> 21:55.109
and Crowley ends up sending us
out here anyways.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.903
Are you kid...?
All right, that's a whole
nother problem, but right now,

21:56.940 --> 21:58.578
now you can make a choice.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.510
You should come with us.
No, we're not leaVIng.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.108
Ma'am, it is not safe here.

22:02.150 --> 22:04.380
Do you quit your job
any time it gets dangerous?

22:04.420 --> 22:07.810
People here are used to
Western aid workers taking off

22:07.860 --> 22:10.522
when things get ugly.
We're trying to change that.

22:10.560 --> 22:11.982
Yeah, I respect
that commitment, I really do,

22:12.030 --> 22:13.793
but it's open season
on Americans.

22:13.830 --> 22:16.355
You do understand that, right?
I mean, you must have seen

22:16.400 --> 22:17.958
the... the photo
of the American aid worker

22:18.000 --> 22:19.968
who was murdered
a few days ago?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.968
Hannah.
Yeah,Hannah.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.399
She was a dear friend.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.067
We've lost a lot
of friends

22:25.110 --> 22:27.578
over the years.

22:27.610 --> 22:28.872
Excuse me.
I'm sure you have

22:28.910 --> 22:30.400
as well.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.769
Yeah.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.674
(clears throat)
Listen, boss...
Yeah?

22:36.720 --> 22:39.086
Tell you what, I got
a... a bag full of zip ties

22:39.120 --> 22:40.883
and two shoulders.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.911
You want them to come with us,
they're coming.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.689
How you doing,
little buddy?

22:44.730 --> 22:46.686
Here. Take that
to your buddy over there.

22:46.730 --> 22:48.459
Sharing's caring.
Boop.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.990
(short chuckle)

22:51.470 --> 22:53.961
Go home! Go home! Go home!

22:54.000 --> 22:58.630
Go home! Go home! Go home!
Go home! Go home!

22:58.670 --> 23:00.001
MAN (over P.A.):
Opposition forces are now

23:00.040 --> 23:02.679
taking over government agencies.
Immediately destroy

23:02.710 --> 23:04.940
all classified documents.
Repeat:

23:04.980 --> 23:07.710
immediately destroy
all classified documents.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.672
What do you mean,
he already knows?

23:09.720 --> 23:13.554
Okay, look, what I mean is that
the guy we came here to get

23:13.590 --> 23:17.014
talked to the acting ambassador
Crowley today, right?

23:17.060 --> 23:18.527
He told him that
he wasn't gonna leave.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.118
(scoffs)
Son of a...

23:20.160 --> 23:22.856
Yeah. All right, also, did
he send us here to kidnap him?

23:22.900 --> 23:24.492
Because I'm telling you right
now that's not gonna happen,

23:24.530 --> 23:26.464
all right? These people,
they know the risks.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.536
They're willing to take it,
and they're not going anywhere.

23:28.570 --> 23:31.038
They say they don't want to go,
we can't take them. Problem is,

23:31.070 --> 23:33.038
now you're a couple hours
deeper in the bush

23:33.070 --> 23:34.674
and it's a couple hours
closer to nightfall.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.678
Protests are turning violent
nationwide.

23:36.710 --> 23:37.870
Well, don't worry about us.

23:37.910 --> 23:39.104
We're heading back to you now.

23:39.150 --> 23:40.549
Okay, drive fast.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.468
Things are only getting worse.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.819
Yeah, I'm holding for
the assistant secretary.

23:45.850 --> 23:50.480
Uh... uh, yes,
I'll-I'll keep holding.

23:50.530 --> 23:55.729
I... I can't really,
uh... yes? What?

23:55.760 --> 23:56.897
Order the evac.

23:56.930 --> 23:57.965
Excuse me?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.820
You have the authority.
Acting ambassador reports...

23:59.870 --> 24:01.735
You don't need to tell me
my authority, thank you.

24:01.770 --> 24:02.930
You're gambling
with people's lives.

24:02.970 --> 24:04.608
I'm entrusted
with advancing

24:04.640 --> 24:06.733
the national interests
of the United States

24:06.770 --> 24:08.237
and I don't believe
it's within that interest

24:08.280 --> 24:09.975
to send a message
that we cut and run

24:10.010 --> 24:12.069
at the first sign of trouble.
Is it in the national interest

24:12.110 --> 24:13.008
to send the only
Tier One asset

24:13.050 --> 24:15.610
currently in this country
to rescue a guy

24:15.650 --> 24:16.969
you knew didn't want
to be rescued?

24:17.020 --> 24:20.217
Guy who happens to be the son
of a major campaign donor?

24:20.250 --> 24:22.753
I think it's in
your best interest

24:22.790 --> 24:24.781
to be able to
tell Erik's daddy

24:24.830 --> 24:27.048
that you sent
the best men you had.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.921
That way, whichever way
it works out for Erik,

24:28.960 --> 24:31.599
you get to look like you did
everything you could.

24:31.630 --> 24:33.666
"The ambassador is
responsible for the safety

24:33.700 --> 24:36.260
"of every American citizen
inside the borders

24:36.300 --> 24:38.006
of his or her host country."

24:38.040 --> 24:41.077
We have men outside the wire
and if anything happens to them

24:41.110 --> 24:42.702
because you decided
to risk their lives...

24:42.740 --> 24:44.708
They joined up
to risk their lives!

24:44.750 --> 24:46.638
They certainly did.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.648
And if you don't order
the evac now,

24:48.680 --> 24:51.217
I swear to God,
I will find a way to burn you.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.957
Uh, yes, sir.

24:54.990 --> 24:57.754
(laughs): Thank you,
Mr. Assistant Secretary.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.925
Sir, I...

25:03.970 --> 25:05.995
I need to inform you...

25:06.030 --> 25:07.998
the situation here
has become untenable.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.133
I'm ordering a
complete evacuation

25:10.170 --> 25:11.637
of the mission
here in Juba.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.581
SONNY:
This doesn't look good.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.087
JASON: Yeah, these
definitely aren't the guys

25:26.120 --> 25:27.656
who waved us through
earlier today.

25:29.020 --> 25:31.250
Ah, these guys
don't look political.

25:31.290 --> 25:33.224
They look more like bandits.

25:33.260 --> 25:35.626
We don't know
who they are yet.

25:35.660 --> 25:39.096
But it looks like
they shot those guards.

25:39.130 --> 25:42.861
Anyone goes for the DShK,
shoot 'em in the face.

25:49.110 --> 25:51.101
(man speaking foreign language)

25:52.880 --> 25:54.973
Call your shots.
He's mine.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.142
Left near.
Right far.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.188
Step out now!

26:03.660 --> 26:05.685
The DShK.
On me.

26:10.030 --> 26:11.691
Go.

26:23.340 --> 26:24.944
Anybody hit?

26:24.980 --> 26:27.005
We're good.
We're good.
Okay.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.156
(men shouting)

26:37.190 --> 26:42.856
(bottles breaking)

26:42.900 --> 26:45.164
Ray, militias
are setting up roadblocks.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.067
Gonna need your help
to get us out of here.

26:48.100 --> 26:48.998
All right, give me a sec

26:49.040 --> 26:50.962
and I'll get Davis
to call for the drone.

26:51.010 --> 26:54.104
(shouting)

27:01.980 --> 27:06.041
Go home! Go home! Go home!
Go home! Go home!

27:06.090 --> 27:08.081
CROWLEY: _
Yes, we are evacuating post.

27:08.120 --> 27:11.419
As of 0400, the embassy is
shutting down normal operations.

27:11.460 --> 27:13.997
Oh, oh-- yeah.

27:14.930 --> 27:16.955
Hey. Hey.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.820
Call MacDill Air Force Base,
Marine Corps Central Command,

27:18.870 --> 27:21.168
and request that they
send a rescue convoy.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.737
No, H was told the vehicles
are already en route.

27:23.770 --> 27:24.998
They'll be here
in one hour,

27:25.040 --> 27:26.860
but you need to make
the official request

27:26.910 --> 27:28.104
so that the ground commander
doesn't get dinged

27:28.140 --> 27:29.402
for violating
his chain of command.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.840
(inhales sharply)
Yeah, okay.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.916
Call MacDill on
your sat phone.

27:33.950 --> 27:35.042
Ask to be rescued.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.308
Then give your people
the "attaboy" for the quick work

27:36.350 --> 27:39.012
that they're doing destroying
all this classified material.

27:39.050 --> 27:40.859
Thank you.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.420
Dismissed.

27:44.460 --> 27:47.918
RAY:
The evacuation convoy is gonna
reach the embassy in 40 minutes.

27:47.960 --> 27:48.995
JASON:
Copy. Thanks, Ray.

27:49.030 --> 27:50.964
Okay, after this turn,
you're gonna stay straight

27:51.000 --> 27:53.093
100 meters
till you hit the roundabout.

27:54.770 --> 27:57.091
JASON: Okay,
we're making the turn now.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.300
(men shouting)

27:58.340 --> 28:00.160
100 meters.

28:00.210 --> 28:04.806
Go home! Go home! Go home!
Go home! Go home!

28:04.850 --> 28:09.878
Go home! Go home!
Go home! Go home! Go home!

28:09.920 --> 28:11.342
RAY:
All right, Jace, we're online

28:11.390 --> 28:14.109
with the tracking device
and the drone feed.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.184
We're gonna guide you back
to the embassy.

28:15.220 --> 28:17.723
JASON: I don't know, Ray.
This is looking hairy.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.387
You're okay.
Just stay online.

28:19.430 --> 28:21.921
Just 75 more meters.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.269
Go home! Go home!

28:26.070 --> 28:27.697
Looking good.
All right, 50 meters.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.866
(shouting)

28:34.180 --> 28:36.774
We got to get
out of here, boss.

28:36.810 --> 28:38.402
Left up there,
left up there.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.839
(shouting continues)

28:40.880 --> 28:42.848
RAY: It's too much smoke.
I'm losing visual.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.381
Bandit, this is TOC, can you
get another angle on that?

28:44.420 --> 28:45.409
PILOT:
We're trying.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.849
Whoa.

28:49.890 --> 28:51.426
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back, back, back, back, back.

28:51.460 --> 28:52.882
Back up.
Go.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.052
Good, go.
(objects striking vehicle)

28:57.100 --> 28:59.796
JASON:
Where are we going, Ray?

28:59.830 --> 29:01.229
Talk to me, Ray.
Where am I going?

29:01.270 --> 29:02.237
(bottle shatters)

29:02.270 --> 29:04.101
I'm working on it. They're
gonna get sealed in.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.335
Bandit, this is TOC,
we need you to find

29:06.370 --> 29:08.008
a hole in that smoke now.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.975
Tell her to take her time.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.399
Whenever you feel
like it, Ray.

29:13.450 --> 29:15.042
Oh, my God.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.816
(shouting)

29:17.850 --> 29:18.919
RAY:
Bravo 1,

29:18.950 --> 29:20.178
you've got an armed militia
dead ahead of you.

29:20.220 --> 29:21.414
Back out of there.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.119
Whoa, whoa. Okay.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.821
All back, all back, all back.

29:23.860 --> 29:26.181
Come on!

29:26.230 --> 29:28.528
G0, 90, 90: 90: 90-

29:30.530 --> 29:32.361
Okay, I got it.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.129
RAY:
You're gonna take
the second-- no,

29:34.170 --> 29:36.161
make that third exit
off the roundabout.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.134
Left, left, left, left,
left, left, left, left.

29:38.170 --> 29:40.331
Easy, easy.

29:42.140 --> 29:43.232
(glass shatters)

29:46.010 --> 29:47.272
RAY:
Oh, you are clear left.

29:47.310 --> 29:49.039
Repeat, your left is clear.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.387
(laughs)

30:05.030 --> 30:07.123
(exhales)

30:07.170 --> 30:11.129
(phone vibrating)

30:11.170 --> 30:13.206
(knock on door)

30:13.240 --> 30:15.003
Dude, we got to go now.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.302
They're calling us in.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.046
We got 59--

30:18.080 --> 30:19.069
we have 58 minutes.
Sorry to...

30:19.110 --> 30:21.249
Thank you so much,
it was a really great party.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.417
Why didn't you get me up before?

30:22.450 --> 30:23.474
BRIAN:
Eat It, man.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.249
I should have left you here.
Sorry we can't stay

30:25.290 --> 30:27.110
to clean up.

30:27.150 --> 30:28.811
No, you're not.
(chuckles)

30:30.890 --> 30:32.187
Somebody got lucky
last night, huh?

30:32.230 --> 30:34.027
What'd I tell you?
Shirt never fails.

30:34.060 --> 30:35.027
(laughs)

30:35.060 --> 30:39.099
Go home! Go home! Go home!
Go home! Go home!

30:39.130 --> 30:41.530
Let me get on the comms.

30:41.570 --> 30:43.595
Now get to the convoy.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.039
Are you coming with me?

30:45.070 --> 30:47.106
Yeah, I'll be there
as soon as I'm done

30:47.140 --> 30:48.209
helping our boys
navigate back here.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.901
Okay, I'll leave when you leave.

30:49.940 --> 30:51.202
This isn't Virginia Beach,

30:51.250 --> 30:52.501
and I'm not asking.
Ray, I just want you to...

30:52.550 --> 30:55.849
Lisa... get to the convoy.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.016
I'll be right behind you.

31:07.460 --> 31:10.293
(helicopter passes overhead)

31:10.330 --> 31:12.992
On time is five minutes late.

31:13.030 --> 31:14.258
I can prove
that's not true.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.962
Won't happen again,
Master Chief.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.608
Next few days,
you're gonna be all HALO.

31:20.640 --> 31:24.007
We'll be making multiple jumps
at 14,000 feet and upwards,

31:24.050 --> 31:26.143
free-falling in formation,

31:26.180 --> 31:27.306
pulling at 4,000.

31:27.350 --> 31:29.272
Day, night,
you name it.

31:29.320 --> 31:32.209
We will culminate the training
with night wall locker jumps,

31:32.250 --> 31:33.387
and a follow-on mission.

31:33.420 --> 31:35.354
Clear?

31:36.320 --> 31:38.185
Clear.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.084
RAY: We're loading the convoy
at the embassy right now.

31:41.960 --> 31:42.927
that's just ahead
to your right.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.666
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

31:44.700 --> 31:47.225
Negative. Visibility down
that direction is close to zero.

31:47.270 --> 31:49.238
Damn it. Wait one.
Drone control,

31:49.270 --> 31:51.158
can you do anything
about these optics?

31:51.210 --> 31:52.131
PILOT:
Negative, TOC.

31:52.170 --> 31:53.660
Been through all my filters.

31:53.710 --> 31:55.200
Bravo 1?
Yeah, I heard.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.071
All right, we're not gonna
be able to get back

31:57.110 --> 31:58.441
to the embassy before
you hit the convoy.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.175
Tell you what, we'll
rendezvous at the airfield.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.313
Jace.
Notopen

32:01.350 --> 32:02.715
for discussion, Ray.
You understand

32:02.750 --> 32:04.081
that means you're gonna have
to drive through

32:04.120 --> 32:05.087
the city center blind.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.109
One vehicle, no overwatch.

32:06.150 --> 32:07.242
Yeah, I understand that.

32:07.290 --> 32:08.552
1, out.

32:08.590 --> 32:10.148
Go.

32:10.190 --> 32:13.318
(shouting)

32:13.360 --> 32:15.248
(glass shattering)

32:20.200 --> 32:23.169
(glass shatters,
man grunts)

32:38.050 --> 32:40.280
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

32:44.190 --> 32:45.179
Right over there.

32:46.730 --> 32:49.358
(overlapping shouting)

32:53.530 --> 32:55.339
Bravo 2, come in.

32:55.370 --> 32:57.395
(static)

32:57.440 --> 32:59.362
Ray.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.236
Bravo 2, sitrep.

33:03.280 --> 33:05.271
(static)

33:08.720 --> 33:10.676
We've got to move out, ma'am.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.688
(crowd continues shouting)

33:12.720 --> 33:16.087
(quietly): Oh, come on, Ray.
Come on, come on.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.425
(shouting)

33:26.400 --> 33:28.436
DAVIS:
Ray!

33:28.470 --> 33:31.234
The hell are you
still doing here?
Oh, you're-you're asking me?

33:31.270 --> 33:32.760
The reporter got
hit by a rock.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.334
Spotted him on the way down.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.335
Tried radioing you.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.029
Yeah, the comms are a mess.

33:39.380 --> 33:41.177
Oh, we're here?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.744
Yeah, we are.

33:42.780 --> 33:45.419
Well, you need to know that
when I'm shooting at the range,

33:45.450 --> 33:47.441
the targets don't shoot back.
Well, the alternative's

33:47.490 --> 33:49.617
you carry this heavy
son of a bitch.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.481
I know you're strong...
I got it, I got it.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.351
R.O.E. essentially says
that we can't smoke a guy

33:57.400 --> 33:59.095
unless he makes it him or us.

33:59.130 --> 34:00.666
You just got to tell yourself...

34:00.700 --> 34:02.258
it's not gonna be us.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.200
It's not gonna be us.

34:04.240 --> 34:06.105
Okay.

34:06.140 --> 34:07.562
(clears throat)

34:21.320 --> 34:22.389
(both speak foreign language)

34:30.800 --> 34:33.223
(crowd shouting)

34:33.270 --> 34:34.259
RAY:
Crowley left us.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.689
(shouting continues)

34:46.510 --> 34:47.841
Go home! Go home! Go home!

34:47.880 --> 34:50.075
(chanting continues)

34:54.390 --> 34:56.779
What do you mean, he left you?
DAVIS: Crowley.

34:56.820 --> 34:58.720
Moved out the convoy while Ray
and I were still inside.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.284
You got to be kidding.

35:00.330 --> 35:01.752
Make sure he knows
I sent you outside.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.291
Your crazy ass decided
to come back in.

35:04.330 --> 35:05.399
All right,
we're coming for you.

35:05.430 --> 35:07.125
Back to the embassy.

35:07.170 --> 35:09.365
(shouting)

35:12.640 --> 35:14.335
(glass breaking)

35:14.380 --> 35:16.769
This reporter's not gonna
make it much longer.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.903
Neither are we.
It's one thing

35:18.950 --> 35:21.748
to wave the MP7 to scare away
a few looters here and there.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.340
Sooner or later,

35:24.390 --> 35:26.415
this crowd's gonna breach
the perimeter.

35:27.420 --> 35:30.514
(shouting)

35:33.630 --> 35:36.155
JASON: Davis, we're going
to secure an observation post

35:36.200 --> 35:38.464
across from the embassy.
Stand by.

35:55.550 --> 35:58.917
I really can't smoke this idiot
with the Molotov?
Tell you what.

35:58.950 --> 36:00.542
If it looks like he's about to
throw it at someone, shwack him.

36:00.590 --> 36:02.558
What if I thought
he was gonna throw it?

36:04.290 --> 36:06.520
(shouting continues)

36:15.400 --> 36:17.561
He left the flag.
He left the flag.

36:17.600 --> 36:19.363
Crowley?

36:19.410 --> 36:21.503
He also left two of our people.

36:23.540 --> 36:25.349
I think I got a way
to get you guys out.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.302
We could use one.

36:27.350 --> 36:29.215
Okay, first,
I need you to tell Ray

36:29.250 --> 36:30.444
how to get to the control panel

36:30.480 --> 36:31.617
that operates the front gate.

36:31.650 --> 36:33.618
Then I got a job for you.

36:49.370 --> 36:51.258
RAY:
I'm at the front gate control.

36:51.310 --> 36:54.370
JASON:
All right. Davis is on the roof.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.874
(shouting)

37:03.020 --> 37:04.544
Want me to press it?

37:04.590 --> 37:05.818
No, no, not yet.

37:05.850 --> 37:09.217
(shouting)

37:16.600 --> 37:20.468
(cheering)

37:22.870 --> 37:24.963
Press it.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.035
They'll rush the front entrance.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.504
Meet you in the rear.

37:29.540 --> 37:31.701
(shouting, whooping)

37:37.450 --> 37:39.611
(glass shattering)

37:48.600 --> 37:49.749
(grunts)
It worked.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.598
Back gate clear.

37:52.630 --> 37:55.667
(shouting)
(glass shattering)

38:05.410 --> 38:07.446
(distant chanting)

38:07.480 --> 38:09.516
RAY:
Oh, great.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.678
(tires screech)

38:16.890 --> 38:18.619
(tires screech)

38:26.830 --> 38:29.993
SONNY: Go, go, go!

38:30.040 --> 38:31.462
(tires screech)

38:31.510 --> 38:33.660
(engine rewing)

38:34.710 --> 38:37.679
Good to see you, Davis.

38:37.710 --> 38:39.905
Good to be seen.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.137
SONNY:
Well, look who we got here.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.728
Hey, Crowley,
how you doing, buddy?

39:08.780 --> 39:10.133
Can I get yourself a beer?

39:10.180 --> 39:11.602
(grunting)

39:11.650 --> 39:13.504
You weasel!

39:16.920 --> 39:19.115
Got something for you.

39:19.150 --> 39:20.742
Yeah? What's that?

39:20.790 --> 39:23.611
You must have left it behind
by accident.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.469
First stick, you're
the first to jump!

39:39.510 --> 39:41.671
Get on the truck!

39:41.710 --> 39:43.701
Hey.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.506
I like her.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.847
Stella.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.610
Yeah, me, too.

39:50.650 --> 39:52.743
Try not to screw it up, okay?

39:52.790 --> 39:54.951
I'm working on it.

39:55.620 --> 39:57.156
Second stick going up!

39:57.190 --> 39:59.624
You're boarding the green truck!
Second to jump!

40:06.830 --> 40:07.797
Hey, hold up, boys.

40:08.870 --> 40:10.633
You all right?

40:10.670 --> 40:13.730
I guess you really were
the one, man.

40:25.020 --> 40:28.456
All right, Team 2, let's go!

40:32.930 --> 40:34.727
PILOT:
DZSO, this is Bandit 1.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.648
Copy winds two to four
out of the north.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.794
Second team jumpers away,
looking for six canopies.

40:39.830 --> 40:41.536
Bandit 1, this is DZSO.

40:41.570 --> 40:44.698
Copy, jumpers away,
looking for six canopies.

40:47.110 --> 40:50.238
Bandit 1, five canopies,
looking for a sixth.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.771
Negative contact.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.773
PILOT:
Copy, DZSO.

40:57.820 --> 40:59.617
We have contact
with the sixth jumper.

40:59.650 --> 41:01.982
He's at 5,000 feet.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.625
Looks like a partial.
We'll keep eyes on.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.719
FINN:
Copy, Bandit. We see him now.

41:06.760 --> 41:09.593
Medics, stand by!

41:09.630 --> 41:12.098
CLAY:
What's going on?

41:12.130 --> 41:13.620
Looks like a line over.

41:13.670 --> 41:16.161
Jumper in distress
falling through 3,000 feet.

41:20.140 --> 41:22.734
Copy, Bandit 1. Hoping to
see a cut-away real quick.

41:26.850 --> 41:30.809
We have cut-away.
Looking for reserve deployment.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.987
Still looking
for reserve deployment.

41:41.830 --> 41:44.196
DZSO, this is Bandit 1.

41:44.230 --> 41:45.697
Jumper has impact ground

41:45.730 --> 41:48.733
about 800 meters northeast
of the drop zone.

41:49.770 --> 41:52.637
Bandit 1, this is DZSO.

41:52.670 --> 41:56.629
Remaining jumpers touching down
in the drop zone.

41:56.680 --> 42:01.276
Identity of the casualty
still unknown.

42:01.310 --> 42:04.108
Jumper appeared
to impact ground at speed.

42:04.150 --> 42:06.118
Never saw a reserve deployment.

42:06.150 --> 42:08.948
We will maintain our orbit
to guide you in.

42:08.990 --> 42:11.959
FINN: Bandit 1,
good copy on all.

42:11.990 --> 42:13.878
En route.

42:13.930 --> 42:16.194
