WEBVTT

01:28.831 --> 01:31.731
The fine imposed is
$750.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.333
How long do you need to pay?

01:33.335 --> 01:34.402
Seven...

01:35.403 --> 01:36.404
I don't ha...

01:38.074 --> 01:40.908
I don't have a job.

01:40.910 --> 01:43.010
You have 90 days.

01:43.012 --> 01:45.645
You will also take an approved
anger management course

01:45.647 --> 01:47.447
in the next 30 days.

01:47.449 --> 01:48.818
See the clerk on the way out.

01:55.690 --> 01:58.493
Hm, uh, Alaska Rose?

02:08.937 --> 02:10.637
Do you understand the
instructions given

02:10.639 --> 02:12.307
at the beginning of this
hearing?

02:15.410 --> 02:17.345
That would be either a yes or a
no.

02:18.915 --> 02:19.916
Yeah.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.821
Possession of alcohol in
public.

02:26.823 --> 02:29.089
I didn't do anything.

02:29.091 --> 02:29.892
What was that?

02:31.127 --> 02:33.127
I didn't even do anything
wrong.

02:33.129 --> 02:36.063
You pled no contest at the
start of these proceedings.

02:36.065 --> 02:38.431
Are you now changing your plea?

02:38.433 --> 02:39.632
It wasn't even my drink.

02:39.634 --> 02:41.836
I was just holding it for
somebody else.

02:41.838 --> 02:44.737
And I suppose the fake
ID found on your person

02:44.739 --> 02:47.409
bearing your picture belongs
to someone else as well?

02:50.146 --> 02:53.646
Miss Rose, you just turned 18.

02:53.648 --> 02:55.415
That means, now more than ever,

02:55.417 --> 02:59.819
the decisions you make
carry lifelong consequences.

02:59.821 --> 03:03.090
Now this being your first
recorded offense as an adult,

03:03.092 --> 03:07.760
I will suspend the 60 days
detention in county jail

03:07.762 --> 03:10.998
in lieu of 100 hours of
community service.

03:11.000 --> 03:11.664
100 hours?

03:11.666 --> 03:14.134
That's like my entire life.

03:14.136 --> 03:15.670
Let's make that 150.

03:17.672 --> 03:18.975
Would you prefer 200?

03:21.843 --> 03:24.144
If you get into any
trouble during this time,

03:24.146 --> 03:25.948
and I mean so much as a speeding
ticket,

03:27.449 --> 03:30.084
you will serve your time in
full.

03:30.086 --> 03:33.921
You get this right, and you
walk away with a clean slate.

03:33.923 --> 03:38.027
You mess up again, and you
will go to jail for real,

03:38.928 --> 03:41.996
and you will carry with you
an adult criminal record

03:41.998 --> 03:43.832
for the rest of your life.

03:45.201 --> 03:46.466
So ordered.

03:49.738 --> 03:51.571
And might I suggest you leave my
courtroom

03:51.573 --> 03:53.109
while I'm still in a good mood?

04:52.301 --> 04:53.501
Just...

04:55.237 --> 04:56.205
Wait a minute.

04:59.308 --> 05:00.642
I gotta say somethin'.

05:02.911 --> 05:05.081
And what was wrong
with the last 40 minutes?

05:07.916 --> 05:08.917
Alaska.

05:10.119 --> 05:11.818
Hey, get back here!

05:21.963 --> 05:22.895
Do you think I'm gonna allow

05:22.897 --> 05:24.233
you to continue this disrespect?

05:25.800 --> 05:28.634
- The hell did I do now?
- Watch the mouth.

05:28.636 --> 05:30.605
Sorry, did I say a swear word?

05:31.840 --> 05:33.840
You're out of control.

05:33.842 --> 05:34.843
You...

05:35.777 --> 05:37.079
Are you enjoying this?

05:43.085 --> 05:44.120
What are you doing?

05:44.986 --> 05:45.987
Grounding you.

05:48.823 --> 05:50.126
Grounding me?

05:51.260 --> 05:53.127
You're not taking my keys!

05:53.129 --> 05:54.994
Don't tell me what I can't do.

05:54.996 --> 05:58.265
You will drive to school
and you will drive home

05:58.267 --> 05:59.665
and that is it.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.135
I'm 18 years old!

06:01.137 --> 06:03.270
I don't care if you're 35!

06:03.272 --> 06:05.241
Everything in this house belongs
to me.

06:06.808 --> 06:08.242
I need my keys.

06:08.244 --> 06:09.209
My house.

06:09.211 --> 06:10.777
My rules.

06:10.779 --> 06:12.011
My keys.

06:12.013 --> 06:15.282
I'm supposed to be somewhere
tonight and I need my keys!

06:15.284 --> 06:16.949
Stop it, Allie.

06:16.951 --> 06:18.618
Just...

06:18.620 --> 06:19.652
Just stop it.

06:19.654 --> 06:21.155
You are not going anywhere
tonight.

06:21.157 --> 06:23.992
You are not going
anywhere for a long time.

06:25.261 --> 06:27.827
This isn't happening.

06:27.829 --> 06:30.364
This is not happening.

06:30.366 --> 06:33.833
Do you grasp what is
happening?

06:34.969 --> 06:37.637
You were just arrested, Allie.

06:37.639 --> 06:39.206
Arrested!

06:39.208 --> 06:41.408
You could be in jail right
now which is way different

06:41.410 --> 06:43.945
than some little overnight
holding cell.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.915
You are not going
who-knows-where, anymore.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.650
Since when do you care where I
go?

06:50.652 --> 06:51.653
Excuse me?

06:53.155 --> 06:55.289
Mom would never do this.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.890
Mom would never try and trap me
here

06:57.892 --> 06:59.259
and freak out like this!

06:59.261 --> 07:01.060
Okay, okay.

07:01.062 --> 07:03.830
Well, why don't we just give her
a call?

07:03.832 --> 07:06.302
Oh, that's right, she didn't
leave us a phone number.

07:10.139 --> 07:12.141
Father of the Year.

07:16.245 --> 07:17.213
I'm the bad guy.

07:18.913 --> 07:21.215
You get arrested and it
all comes back to me!

07:26.020 --> 07:27.021
Never fails.

07:56.084 --> 07:58.320
Lookin' for an idea for
that science project?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.155
Think you've only got about a
week

08:01.157 --> 08:03.089
till you have to turn somethin'
in, right?

08:03.091 --> 08:05.925
I told you already, the Solar
System.

08:05.927 --> 08:07.394
Oh.

08:07.396 --> 08:08.397
Maybe you did.

08:09.998 --> 08:12.301
Look, maybe we can work
on it this weekend.

08:13.402 --> 08:15.302
Can I have some more noodles?

08:15.304 --> 08:17.003
I don't think Allie's had any.

08:17.005 --> 08:19.839
She's not eating, she never
eats here.

08:19.841 --> 08:20.842
Oh, yeah?

08:22.810 --> 08:24.246
Let me go check on her first.

08:26.282 --> 08:28.149
Is she going away, like to
prison?

08:32.787 --> 08:35.322
No, Allie's not going to
prison.

08:35.323 --> 08:36.991
Your sister's not a criminal.

09:02.817 --> 09:03.818
Allie?

09:09.891 --> 09:11.458
Allie?

09:11.460 --> 09:12.794
Yeah.

09:14.396 --> 09:15.928
Are you hungry?

09:15.930 --> 09:17.098
Got dinner for you.

09:18.567 --> 09:20.402
No, thanks.

10:33.274 --> 10:34.909
What frigging took you so
long?

10:36.578 --> 10:38.179
Don't even get me started.

10:40.482 --> 10:42.183
Is Derek there?

10:42.884 --> 10:46.018
Everyone's there and it's
really late.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.556
I really didn't want to leave.

10:50.258 --> 10:53.159
Buckle up!

11:09.944 --> 11:11.347
Alaska girl.

11:13.314 --> 11:14.450
There's my favorite Eskimo.

11:15.617 --> 11:17.285
Still never lived there.

11:17.919 --> 11:20.319
No, you're too hot to live
there.

11:20.321 --> 11:22.456
Try and melt the whole
place down or somethin'.

11:22.458 --> 11:25.057
Are you trying to be a dork?

11:25.059 --> 11:28.160
So what's this I hear
about you getting arrested?

11:28.162 --> 11:32.064
It's nothing, I just
got caught with a fake ID

11:32.066 --> 11:34.634
when I was getting a ride
home with some college girls.

11:34.636 --> 11:36.137
Oh, those college girls.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.107
They're a bad influence, aren't
they?

11:41.410 --> 11:42.411
Maybe.

11:43.645 --> 11:44.646
You wanna go upstairs?

11:45.279 --> 11:47.416
It's all cool, we'll
go in one of the rooms.

11:48.517 --> 11:51.551
I kinda just got here.

11:51.553 --> 11:53.522
Do you wanna take a walk
instead?

11:54.623 --> 11:55.624
Sure.

12:36.397 --> 12:37.398
Yes?

12:44.238 --> 12:47.674
Oh, it'll be a few minutes,
I need to call Miss Wheeler.

12:47.676 --> 12:48.644
Is this our new help?

12:52.614 --> 12:54.614
Alaska, is it?

12:54.616 --> 12:56.483
They call me Allie.

12:56.485 --> 12:59.588
Well, I'm Amanda Wheeler, I
kind of oversee things here.

13:00.789 --> 13:02.722
And you've already met Ben.

13:02.724 --> 13:04.691
He pretty much does everything
we need.

13:04.693 --> 13:05.694
Helps us a lot.

13:07.729 --> 13:08.595
Okay, you wanna come with

13:08.597 --> 13:10.597
me, and I'll give you the brief
tour?

13:10.599 --> 13:12.164
Can I have my paper back?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.767
Ben can make a copy of it for
you

13:13.769 --> 13:15.637
and give it back to you when
you're done.

13:16.705 --> 13:17.706
Come on.

13:21.710 --> 13:23.978
So, this is one of our dining
halls.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.547
Pretty empty right now,

13:27.549 --> 13:31.018
but at dinner time in a couple
of hours, it'll be very busy.

13:31.986 --> 13:34.353
Of course, some of our
residents eat in their rooms,

13:34.355 --> 13:36.190
but it is a good time to
socialize.

13:36.892 --> 13:39.595
A lot of them love getting
together around dinner.

13:40.662 --> 13:43.162
We have games, too, even
dancing.

13:43.164 --> 13:47.134
The festivities can get a bit
out of hand some evenings.

13:49.270 --> 13:50.271
This way.

13:53.809 --> 13:56.475
Through that door is our medical
wing,

13:56.477 --> 13:58.310
limited on-site emergency
services

13:58.312 --> 14:00.112
and some outpatient stuff.

14:00.114 --> 14:01.750
Oh, physical therapy, of course,
too.

14:05.654 --> 14:06.655
And through here.

14:13.494 --> 14:15.595
This is our terrace.

14:15.597 --> 14:17.797
Quite popular with the
residents.

14:17.799 --> 14:21.467
They can enjoy the view, listen
to music.

14:21.469 --> 14:24.505
Or they can just move
around, get some fresh air.

14:25.273 --> 14:30.644
Out there, we have our deck
area, probably the favorite.

14:30.646 --> 14:32.612
Residents can go out
there if they're mobile

14:32.614 --> 14:34.683
but they're usually accompanied
by family.

14:36.350 --> 14:39.253
They even have fishing
off the deck, once a week.

14:41.657 --> 14:42.758
Have any questions so far?

14:44.760 --> 14:46.125
Yeah.

14:46.127 --> 14:48.129
What am I supposed to be doing
everyday?

14:49.297 --> 14:50.599
That's our final stop.

14:51.733 --> 14:52.734
Here we are.

14:54.736 --> 14:56.235
Mrs. Foster?

14:56.237 --> 14:57.771
It's Amanda.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.519
I brought a friend.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.289
Her name's Alaska, isn't that
cute?

15:22.731 --> 15:27.568
Only two kinds of girls
chew gum in public like that.

15:28.737 --> 15:30.502
And both of them don't belong

15:30.504 --> 15:32.608
in a wholesome place like this.

15:33.507 --> 15:36.910
Now that's not very
welcoming, Mrs. Foster.

15:36.912 --> 15:38.346
She likes to go by Allie.

15:41.850 --> 15:43.683
She's the one I told you about.

15:43.685 --> 15:46.653
The one who's gonna be
spending some time with you?

15:46.655 --> 15:47.689
She's very nice.

15:50.726 --> 15:51.725
I'll be back in a bit.

15:51.727 --> 15:52.728
Wait.

15:57.298 --> 15:58.297
I'm the one who's

15:58.299 --> 16:00.599
signing off on your community
service papers.

16:00.601 --> 16:02.503
Would you rather that time be in
jail?

16:03.739 --> 16:07.608
You two have fun.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.711
What are you laughing at?

16:11.813 --> 16:13.749
We're both in jail.

16:15.751 --> 16:16.752
Hilarious.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.355
"Alaska."

16:22.724 --> 16:24.891
What kind of name is that
anyway?

16:24.893 --> 16:27.763
Sounds like a name from a hippy
commune.

16:29.263 --> 16:30.832
You grow up on a commune?

16:31.967 --> 16:33.601
I don't know what that is.

16:34.568 --> 16:35.671
Oh, Lord.

16:36.738 --> 16:40.241
And you're supposed to
be here for conversation?

16:41.242 --> 16:44.478
No, actually, I'm not
here for conversation.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.683
I don't even know why I'm here.

16:48.817 --> 16:51.583
Don't know why you're here?

16:51.585 --> 16:53.953
You're here because you messed
up.

16:53.955 --> 16:57.826
You've gotta be smart enough
to know that, at least.

17:06.467 --> 17:09.667
Who said you could touch
anything?

17:09.670 --> 17:10.771
Excuse me.

17:13.040 --> 17:18.277
You come in here and put your
grimy hands all over things.

17:18.279 --> 17:21.748
You tried to lift my stuff.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.582
I was just looking at it.

17:23.584 --> 17:27.954
What'd you steal to
get stuck in here, huh?

17:27.955 --> 17:30.992
I didn't steal anything,
you're crazy!

17:34.428 --> 17:35.831
Is everything all
right?

17:36.630 --> 17:38.632
Get out this
room!

17:42.303 --> 17:43.337
Send me to jail.

17:45.974 --> 17:47.441
And stay out!

17:52.814 --> 17:54.948
What kinda place are you running
here?

17:54.950 --> 17:56.783
It's okay, it's done.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.985
Letting hoodlums in our rooms.

17:58.987 --> 18:01.355
What's next, you gonna let the
gangs in?

18:02.991 --> 18:06.492
It's okay, Mrs. Foster, it's
my fault.

18:06.494 --> 18:08.594
I thought it would help.

18:08.596 --> 18:09.929
I'm not crazy.

18:09.931 --> 18:11.599
I know you're not.

18:12.566 --> 18:14.666
But you know it's not
good for you to get upset.

18:14.668 --> 18:15.771
You need to calm down.

18:17.338 --> 18:18.838
I know.

18:18.840 --> 18:19.908
It's gonna be okay.

18:20.876 --> 18:22.574
You've already had a long day.

18:22.576 --> 18:23.879
Maybe you just need some rest.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.681
You tell her...

18:30.018 --> 18:30.819
I'm not crazy.

18:36.825 --> 18:38.425
Wasn't the best idea, I guess.

18:39.127 --> 18:41.627
We'll get you started in the
kitchen.

18:41.629 --> 18:44.800
What's, um, wrong with her?

18:46.101 --> 18:48.669
Nothing more than some
of our other residents.

18:49.905 --> 18:50.906
Through here.

19:06.054 --> 19:09.989
I was really supposed to be
out of here like an hour ago.

19:09.991 --> 19:11.090
Where's Allie?

19:11.092 --> 19:12.158
Dude.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.060
Do you know how many times
you've asked me that?

19:14.062 --> 19:15.563
I have no idea.

19:17.966 --> 19:19.333
That's it for our two PM?

19:21.970 --> 19:26.638
It was a, like, a spazzy guy
with them.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.640
I don't know, they booked three.

19:28.642 --> 19:29.845
They booked?

19:30.312 --> 19:32.778
Yeah, when
they called this morning,

19:32.780 --> 19:34.680
and I jotted it down.

19:34.682 --> 19:35.849
I told you
if

19:35.851 --> 19:38.117
it's less than four, you gotta
move them to the next tour

19:38.119 --> 19:39.753
or cancel if it's early enough.

19:43.124 --> 19:44.491
Can I show you something?

19:45.426 --> 19:47.761
All right, boom, boom, boom.

19:48.796 --> 19:50.065
What next one, man?

19:55.103 --> 19:57.603
Hey, you care if I take off?

19:57.605 --> 19:58.806
I'm fine, thanks, Ron.

20:00.674 --> 20:02.474
And I get the extra hour?

20:02.476 --> 20:04.143
- Yes.
- All right.

20:04.145 --> 20:05.146
See ya tomorrow.

20:16.024 --> 20:17.556
Yeah, Dad?

20:17.558 --> 20:19.092
Where are you?

20:19.094 --> 20:20.095
Driving.

20:20.861 --> 20:23.795
Why aren't you at
work?

20:23.797 --> 20:26.065
I'm going to that place.

20:26.067 --> 20:27.733
What place?

20:27.735 --> 20:28.736
The nursing home?

20:29.670 --> 20:30.804
Whatever it is.

20:32.040 --> 20:35.241
Okay well did you forget that
you were scheduled for noon?

20:35.243 --> 20:37.743
I have to
pay my debt to society.

20:37.745 --> 20:40.479
I have like months to go in that
place.

20:40.481 --> 20:41.713
That's all well and good,

20:41.715 --> 20:43.682
but who said that was gonna
interfere with our livelihood?

20:43.684 --> 20:44.616
Dad, please.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.620
What, do you have like two
people there?

20:47.956 --> 20:48.988
No.

20:48.990 --> 20:49.991
No!

20:52.760 --> 20:55.194
And what does that have to
do with your schedule anyway?

20:55.196 --> 20:56.764
What do you want me to do?

20:57.765 --> 20:58.766
Be responsible.

21:02.670 --> 21:03.671
Okay, just...

21:04.973 --> 21:06.571
Be careful.

21:06.573 --> 21:07.775
- See you tonight.
- Bye.

21:11.279 --> 21:13.645
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, Conner?

21:13.647 --> 21:15.984
- Yeah.
- It's Bryan, Shaw.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.153
Of church.

21:18.954 --> 21:21.955
Sorry to drop in on you guys
like this.

21:21.957 --> 21:22.958
That's okay.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.058
Is it a bad time?

21:25.060 --> 21:28.094
No, but uh, we just got
back from the sitter's,

21:28.096 --> 21:30.631
and now we're sittin' down
for dinner and homework.

21:32.267 --> 21:34.633
I understand, I should've
called.

21:34.635 --> 21:36.069
I could've called.

21:36.071 --> 21:37.270
Have we met?

21:37.272 --> 21:41.107
Well, not directly, but my
wife visited a couple times,

21:41.109 --> 21:42.243
when the kids were younger?

21:44.279 --> 21:46.047
Okay, what can I do for you,
man?

21:46.880 --> 21:50.649
Well, it's gonna sound
crazy, and it is kinda crazy,

21:50.651 --> 21:54.686
'cause I don't normally
do stuff like this.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.157
I was at church this weekend,

21:56.924 --> 21:59.626
we haven't seen you guys
for like the longest time.

22:02.297 --> 22:04.032
I just got this feeling.

22:21.282 --> 22:25.619
Anything we can do for
you?

22:26.954 --> 22:28.689
No, but um...

22:30.258 --> 22:32.225
Thanks for coming out, really.

22:32.227 --> 22:33.228
Sure.

22:34.728 --> 22:38.197
Well, maybe we'll see you
Sunday.

22:38.199 --> 22:39.200
Maybe.

22:41.269 --> 22:43.670
Awesome, well, you
guys have a good night.

23:08.296 --> 23:09.797
Dad, what's wrong?

23:13.234 --> 23:14.235
Nothin' at all.

23:37.758 --> 23:38.826
What's your problem?

23:40.727 --> 23:42.894
You didn't answer your phone.

23:42.896 --> 23:44.765
I didn't have my phone on in
class.

23:46.733 --> 23:48.934
What're you doing later?

23:48.936 --> 23:50.802
I have to go that place.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.639
Wanna get all my hours in before
summer.

23:53.408 --> 23:54.608
Not cool.

23:55.410 --> 23:56.743
Also not forever.

23:58.379 --> 24:00.113
True.

24:00.115 --> 24:02.115
Maybe I gotta come there.

24:02.117 --> 24:04.283
I mean, I'm sure you get breaks,
right?

24:04.285 --> 24:05.286
Maybe.

24:13.228 --> 24:14.295
See you later, babe.

24:15.963 --> 24:16.964
Call me.

24:22.403 --> 24:23.436
You're late.

24:23.438 --> 24:24.803
Again.

24:24.805 --> 24:26.972
I do have school, you know.

24:26.974 --> 24:29.242
This isn't like a real job or
anything.

24:29.244 --> 24:30.245
Well...

24:31.412 --> 24:32.213
It is, for us.

24:40.188 --> 24:41.955
All right, I'm making the
rounds.

24:43.291 --> 24:45.260
You know, Mrs. Foster
was asking about you.

24:47.395 --> 24:48.994
That's great.

24:48.996 --> 24:51.230
Yeah, you wanna bring
hers, maybe say hi?

24:51.232 --> 24:52.367
She never leaves her room.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.837
I'll pass, she's probably
just wondering if I'm gone yet.

24:58.173 --> 24:59.971
Oh, well, I'll let her
know that you're not,

24:59.973 --> 25:01.376
and that you're busy down here.

25:02.910 --> 25:04.809
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hey, there.

25:04.811 --> 25:08.414
So, Allie, I thought of
something you could help us with.

25:08.416 --> 25:09.915
Did I do something wrong?

25:09.917 --> 25:12.017
No, no no no, you're fine.

25:12.019 --> 25:15.120
So, the semi-annual
talent show is coming up,

25:15.122 --> 25:16.988
and I'd like for you to be
involved.

25:16.990 --> 25:18.393
I mean, I was gonna ask you.

25:19.294 --> 25:21.159
Talent show?

25:21.161 --> 25:22.461
Mm-hm.

25:22.463 --> 25:23.264
You're serious?

25:24.831 --> 25:26.932
Yes, I am, actually.

25:26.934 --> 25:29.237
I started it four years
ago when I first got here.

25:30.338 --> 25:31.738
Okay?

25:32.072 --> 25:36.275
Anyway, so the last
couple of times have been,

25:36.277 --> 25:39.911
I would say not as successful
as they could have been.

25:39.913 --> 25:44.985
I was hoping that with
somebody new and trendy,

25:45.752 --> 25:47.488
that it would be good for the
program.

25:49.357 --> 25:51.257
"Trendy?"

25:51.259 --> 25:52.525
You know what I mean.

25:52.527 --> 25:54.795
So I was hoping you could start
tomorrow?

25:56.163 --> 25:57.195
I don't know.

25:57.197 --> 25:59.398
I'm not sure this facility
would keep running,

25:59.400 --> 26:01.436
if I wasn't here to pass out
green jello.

26:02.903 --> 26:04.104
I'll see you tomorrow.

26:27.828 --> 26:29.295
Dad's not here?

26:29.297 --> 26:31.464
He said he couldn't wait
anymore.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.468
It's only five minutes after.

26:36.571 --> 26:39.904
Does Dad know you're on the
game?

26:39.906 --> 26:40.907
I don't know.

26:42.510 --> 26:43.944
Do you have any homework?

26:45.280 --> 26:46.281
I don't know.

27:02.062 --> 27:05.130
How about we play one game,

27:05.132 --> 27:06.565
and then look at what
you have for homework?

27:06.567 --> 27:08.634
Even when you always get
totally owned?

27:08.636 --> 27:11.002
Co-op, Kyle.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.471
Same team, please.

27:12.473 --> 27:14.274
Okay, deal.

27:21.148 --> 27:23.349
What, Allie, don't
stop, what're you doing?

27:23.351 --> 27:24.517
I'm not stopping.

27:24.519 --> 27:25.484
I don't know what's
happening, I

27:25.486 --> 27:26.487
- got stuck.
- Turn it, hurry!

27:27.254 --> 27:29.488
Get 'em off me, get them
off...

27:29.490 --> 27:31.222
What do you think I'm doing?

27:31.224 --> 27:32.123
Shoot 'em, shoot!

27:32.125 --> 27:33.626
Go, go, go, go!

27:33.628 --> 27:35.060
You got it!

27:35.062 --> 27:36.227
I win!

27:36.229 --> 27:37.230
We did it.

27:39.099 --> 27:40.100
Awesome.

27:41.402 --> 27:42.403
All right.

27:44.439 --> 27:47.606
Oh, my gosh, that is not the
right time.

27:47.608 --> 27:50.411
Kyle, it was supposed
to be one game, come on.

27:57.184 --> 27:59.086
I don't have any homework
tonight!

28:00.488 --> 28:02.555
I will straight up murder you.

28:02.557 --> 28:04.289
I don't!

28:04.291 --> 28:07.593
My science project was due,
but I'm gonna take the zero.

28:07.595 --> 28:08.694
What do you mean?

28:08.696 --> 28:09.762
You've been talking about
that project forever.

28:09.764 --> 28:13.432
Yeah, we talked about it
but we never started it.

28:13.434 --> 28:15.401
And now it's due tomorrow?

28:15.403 --> 28:16.404
I won't fail.

28:17.472 --> 28:18.504
What's it on?

28:18.506 --> 28:19.507
Let me see it.

28:20.708 --> 28:22.577
I wanted to do the Solar
System.

28:23.644 --> 28:25.546
We never got anything for it.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.448
Come on.

28:30.585 --> 28:31.586
Come on!

29:35.683 --> 29:36.484
Allie.

29:39.186 --> 29:42.289
Did Mom ever help you with
homework and stuff, like tonight?

29:44.559 --> 29:47.593
Yeah, yeah, she, she was
always there

29:47.595 --> 29:50.663
to help with that kind of
stuff when I was little.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.698
I mean, when I was in
middle-school,

29:52.700 --> 29:56.236
I never really asked for
it, even though I wanted it.

29:58.606 --> 30:01.709
And Dad helped too, I
mean, he just worked a lot.

30:03.511 --> 30:07.412
She used to always use this
thing, though, where she'd

30:07.414 --> 30:10.150
make me try everything alone
first, before she'd help.

30:12.653 --> 30:14.622
And it was so frustrating.

30:17.725 --> 30:20.595
But looking back,
it was probably the biggest help of all.

30:21.729 --> 30:23.163
Why did she leave?

30:29.704 --> 30:31.404
You know, bud...

30:33.808 --> 30:37.175
That's something you're gonna
have to ask her.

30:37.177 --> 30:38.713
If you ever get the chance one
day.

30:41.716 --> 30:44.484
I try not to worry about it
anymore.

30:47.755 --> 30:49.456
Maybe you should try that too.

30:51.291 --> 30:52.560
Thanks for helping me.

30:55.428 --> 30:57.430
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

33:03.958 --> 33:04.957
Oh, you got gummies?

33:04.959 --> 33:07.960
I didn't even see the gummies.

33:07.962 --> 33:09.327
Here.

33:09.329 --> 33:10.896
You sure?

33:10.898 --> 33:13.631
Yeah, I got too much of
everything.

33:13.633 --> 33:14.634
Thanks.

33:16.469 --> 33:17.772
Aren't you grounded?

33:18.906 --> 33:19.907
Yeah.

33:21.241 --> 33:22.308
I just needed a break.

33:23.077 --> 33:24.812
You're not finished
with those hours yet?

33:25.780 --> 33:27.414
I just barely started 'em.

33:28.314 --> 33:29.447
Peace.

33:29.449 --> 33:31.884
I know it's a sensitive subject.

33:31.886 --> 33:33.052
It's messed up.

33:33.054 --> 33:36.589
I mean, I constantly feel
like I'm at a funeral home.

33:39.659 --> 33:41.760
That judge must really hate me.

33:41.762 --> 33:43.396
I bet she doesn't have any kids.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.634
Oh, I missed the chocolate
chunks too?

33:50.503 --> 33:51.504
And the boss lady?

33:52.405 --> 33:53.839
Worse than my dad.

33:53.841 --> 33:55.606
It's like I'm the only
person working there,

33:55.608 --> 33:56.911
and I'm not even getting paid.

33:58.445 --> 33:59.446
Dude.

34:00.513 --> 34:01.546
And to top it all

34:01.548 --> 34:03.949
off, she has me doing this
stupid talent show.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.385
Are you serious?

34:07.387 --> 34:08.652
That's what I said, and
then she was

34:08.655 --> 34:11.857
all like, "Oh yeah, I'm a genius
and I started the whole thing,"

34:11.859 --> 34:14.762
and I was like, "Okay?"

34:17.864 --> 34:19.965
Sounds like fun, though.

34:19.967 --> 34:23.467
Maybe you'll find the next
American Idol.

34:23.469 --> 34:24.471
Exactly.

34:28.775 --> 34:29.777
So?

34:30.710 --> 34:32.913
Are you gonna be able
to get out Friday night?

34:35.614 --> 34:37.317
Probably, I'm working on it.

34:38.451 --> 34:40.687
Derek really wants to see you.

34:41.454 --> 34:45.791
He thinks
you've been avoiding him.

34:45.793 --> 34:47.962
I haven't been avoiding
him, I have work.

34:48.661 --> 34:52.431
You know that, I mean, he knows
that.

34:53.100 --> 34:54.935
I'm just telling you what he
says.

34:56.771 --> 34:58.271
And why can't he talk to me?

34:58.939 --> 35:01.508
He probably doesn't wanna make
you mad.

35:03.409 --> 35:04.611
Probably?

35:05.645 --> 35:08.981
Yeah, I mean, you know
as well as I do that it's

35:08.983 --> 35:12.918
easier to talk to friends
about these things than...

35:12.920 --> 35:13.921
Than what?

35:14.587 --> 35:16.656
Than whatever you two are.

35:17.792 --> 35:18.926
"Whatever we are."

35:19.994 --> 35:21.061
What is he saying we are?

35:22.129 --> 35:24.064
He doesn't say anything!

35:24.764 --> 35:26.834
Then what're you talking
about?

35:28.468 --> 35:30.470
Look, I'm just
saying that,

35:31.138 --> 35:33.638
and I'm telling you this
as your friend, okay?

35:33.640 --> 35:36.409
As your best friend, that,

35:37.945 --> 35:42.749
if you don't give your guy
attention, somebody else will.

35:44.617 --> 35:48.053
Are you trying to tell me
something?

35:48.055 --> 35:50.823
No, Alaska, of
course not.

35:50.825 --> 35:52.059
That's not what I'm saying.

35:53.894 --> 35:56.094
That's not what I'm
saying, oh, my goodness.

35:56.096 --> 35:58.431
Okay, look, he loves you, okay?

35:59.066 --> 36:00.598
Okay?

36:00.600 --> 36:01.666
And I love you.

36:01.668 --> 36:03.603
Look, I just want you to be
happy.

36:05.139 --> 36:10.343
So, come out with us,
Friday night.

36:11.611 --> 36:13.477
Thad found this really
cool place in the city

36:13.479 --> 36:14.647
that's got music.

36:16.816 --> 36:18.685
Just tell Derek that you'll be
there.

36:20.820 --> 36:21.821
Okay.

36:29.196 --> 36:30.597
How's it coming along?

36:32.099 --> 36:33.431
Oh, it looks great.

36:33.433 --> 36:34.933
Nice job.

36:34.935 --> 36:36.803
But the time, it's at six.

36:38.906 --> 36:42.007
I kinda thought that
sounded a little late.

36:42.009 --> 36:44.142
Don't old people go to bed
early?

36:44.144 --> 36:46.577
Allie, the event has to be
after dinner.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.146
The soonest is six.

36:48.148 --> 36:51.083
Believe me, they have
no trouble staying up,

36:51.085 --> 36:52.152
if they're having fun.

36:53.486 --> 36:55.120
And I have to be there?

36:55.122 --> 36:57.890
Oh, of course, silly,
you're the new host.

36:57.892 --> 37:00.393
Just add your name in there.

37:01.661 --> 37:02.662
Great.

37:41.734 --> 37:43.168
Watch it!

37:45.505 --> 37:48.073
- Hello?
- I'm sorry, I'm so...

37:48.075 --> 37:49.509
Paying resident here!

37:50.576 --> 37:51.577
Are you okay?

37:53.013 --> 37:55.049
Resident, not inrament.

37:58.651 --> 38:01.987
Are you even supposed
to be up like this?

38:01.989 --> 38:02.990
Hello?

38:08.195 --> 38:10.663
What are you, a doctor now?

38:14.101 --> 38:17.104
Uh, no.

38:21.141 --> 38:24.844
You're doin' that,
uh, talent show, right?

38:27.314 --> 38:29.114
Yeah?

38:29.116 --> 38:33.686
Do you have to audition
for it or something?

38:35.122 --> 38:36.123
Audition?

38:38.158 --> 38:39.026
I don't think so, no.

38:40.793 --> 38:43.061
Oh.

38:43.063 --> 38:44.064
Okay.

38:44.564 --> 38:48.601
Did you wanna be in the talent
show?

38:49.569 --> 38:51.105
Well, if you're insisting.

38:54.774 --> 38:56.642
You could put my name down.

38:59.213 --> 39:02.247
Okay.

39:02.249 --> 39:03.050
Okay.

39:05.019 --> 39:06.184
And...

39:06.186 --> 39:11.225
Keep your face out of that
phone while you're walkin'.

39:14.094 --> 39:16.230
You could kill somebody, next
time.

39:25.838 --> 39:27.041
Oh, boy.

39:27.874 --> 39:30.641
You want me to slap
that smile off your face?

39:30.643 --> 39:32.943
You think I won't?

39:32.945 --> 39:34.146
You think he's gonna stop me

39:34.148 --> 39:35.380
from poundin' you into that
wall?

39:35.382 --> 39:36.314
I don't give a.

39:36.316 --> 39:38.083
I'm gonna be in here till I'm an
old lady.

39:38.085 --> 39:40.951
What're they gonna do to me,
huh?

39:40.953 --> 39:42.087
Give me some more years?

39:42.089 --> 39:43.788
I will beat that smile off your
face,

39:43.790 --> 39:46.258
till you don't know how to smile
anymore.

39:46.260 --> 39:48.826
That's what it's like in here.

39:48.828 --> 39:51.129
Nobody cares whether you
live or whether you die,

39:51.131 --> 39:52.897
and what's yours ain't yours,

39:52.899 --> 39:54.399
it belongs to the biggest and
the baddest.

39:54.401 --> 39:57.269
Do you think anybody
gives a in here,

39:57.271 --> 40:01.772
you had a bad childhood, or
somebody treated you wrong,

40:01.774 --> 40:05.077
or nobody listened to you?

40:05.079 --> 40:08.282
You better wake up.

40:12.286 --> 40:13.984
What's your problem?

40:13.986 --> 40:15.089
What's your problem?

41:11.278 --> 41:13.247
Uh, hi.

41:14.080 --> 41:19.384
Welcome to the seventh
semi-annual variety show.

41:19.386 --> 41:21.986
We hope you enjoy the
performances,

41:21.988 --> 41:26.293
and the showcase of talent so
prevalent here at Sunnyvale.

41:31.964 --> 41:34.299
I bet I can guess what card
you picked.

41:34.301 --> 41:37.435
All right, let's see if you
can guess.

41:37.437 --> 41:39.103
All right, what is it?

41:39.105 --> 41:42.740
- Nine of spades.
- You're perfectly right, yay!

41:44.977 --> 41:46.810
But you know, Miss Wheeler,

41:46.812 --> 41:49.281
she keeps us movin'
out, doesn't she, yeah?

41:49.283 --> 41:52.850
I mean, those double dose
of beans every week, I mean,

41:52.852 --> 41:56.388
new meaning to the word
passing on the left,

41:56.390 --> 42:00.458
you walk down the hall.

42:00.460 --> 42:02.128
But what about us?

42:03.230 --> 42:05.930
We'll always have Panama City.

42:05.932 --> 42:08.466
I said I'd never leave you.

42:08.468 --> 42:12.537
Well, our problems don't
amount to a hill of beans,

42:12.539 --> 42:14.905
in this crazy world.

42:14.907 --> 42:17.444
Someday, you'll understand that.

42:18.811 --> 42:21.279
Now, now.

42:21.281 --> 42:24.482
Here's lookin' at you, kid.

42:36.430 --> 42:39.129
Y'all remember the
Serenity Prayer, right?

42:39.131 --> 42:41.399
There's another one called
the Senility Prayer,

42:41.401 --> 42:44.436
and it basically says,
"God, grant me the grace

42:44.438 --> 42:48.306
"to forget the people I
never really liked anyway."

42:48.308 --> 42:51.576
- Miss Wheeler?
- Yeah?

42:51.578 --> 42:54.412
I'm sorry, but is it gonna be
a problem

42:54.414 --> 42:56.281
if I leave a little early?

42:56.283 --> 42:58.285
My friends just have plans.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.120
Friends?

43:02.289 --> 43:03.290
Or a friend?

43:07.994 --> 43:09.329
I mean, it's up to you.

43:11.230 --> 43:12.231

45:48.455 --> 45:50.122
I don't feel well.

45:51.625 --> 45:52.626
Where am I?

45:54.293 --> 45:56.461
You're in the hospital.

45:56.463 --> 45:57.464
You fainted.

46:03.169 --> 46:05.271
What're you doin' here?

46:11.243 --> 46:13.613
Gotta get my service
hours in somehow, right?

46:16.081 --> 46:18.585
Here, let me, um, yeah.

46:19.318 --> 46:22.254
I can call the nurse,
that's what they get paid for.

46:24.491 --> 46:25.492
Right.

46:26.392 --> 46:27.960
Right, I'm sorry.

46:31.297 --> 46:34.266
I should probably be getting
home anyway, it's really late.

46:37.303 --> 46:38.971
What time is it?

46:40.807 --> 46:42.609
It's about two in the morning.

46:52.451 --> 46:54.451
- What's got you up late, Mrs.
Foster?

46:54.453 --> 46:55.687
What can I get you?

46:55.689 --> 47:00.292
This cursed bed, it's like
something from a cheap motel.

47:00.727 --> 47:03.561
Was your family not able to
help you?

47:03.563 --> 47:05.229
Who?

47:05.231 --> 47:06.232
That girl?

47:07.466 --> 47:08.768
She's not my family.

47:10.737 --> 47:12.436
Oh.

47:12.438 --> 47:15.341
I'm sorry, I just thought she
was a relative or something.

47:16.242 --> 47:19.644
She hasn't left your side
since you were brought in.

47:55.481 --> 47:56.781
Dad.

47:56.783 --> 47:58.752
Don't even say anything.

48:00.286 --> 48:02.419
And I don't even wanna
know where you've been.

48:02.421 --> 48:03.690
I texted you.

48:04.824 --> 48:07.424
I'm not stupid, Alaska.

48:07.426 --> 48:08.628
I know there's some guy.

48:09.863 --> 48:11.629
What?

48:11.631 --> 48:13.798
No, I...

48:13.800 --> 48:15.301
We're going to church, Sunday.

48:20.339 --> 48:23.175
We're going to church,
or I am selling your car.

48:27.747 --> 48:28.748
Fine.

48:30.149 --> 48:31.749
We can be just as fake there

48:31.751 --> 48:33.419
as we are everywhere else,
right?

48:36.623 --> 48:38.555
Why now, though?

48:38.557 --> 48:40.627
You have some sort of
revelation or something?

48:41.728 --> 48:42.796
We need God, Allie.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.167
"We need God."

48:49.201 --> 48:51.671
Right, just like we
needed him four years ago?

48:52.404 --> 48:53.337
What happened, did she take him
with

48:53.339 --> 48:56.674
her? 'Cause he hasn't been
around since.

48:56.676 --> 48:59.278
You can't blame God, he's
always there.

49:02.916 --> 49:06.151
And I know that I haven't
been, I know that.

49:07.821 --> 49:09.789
So if you've gotta blame
somebody, blame me.

49:13.392 --> 49:14.393
I do.

49:29.909 --> 49:32.810
I'd like to read to
you this morning from

49:32.812 --> 49:34.914
Colossians 3, verse 13.

49:36.816 --> 49:40.718
"Bear with each other,
and forgive one another,

49:40.720 --> 49:43.790
"if any of you has a
grievance against someone.

49:45.290 --> 49:47.794
"Forgive, as the Lord forgave
you."

49:49.495 --> 49:52.897
You know, in the Old
Testament, when the Israelites,

49:52.899 --> 49:56.168
God's covenant people,
would displease him,

49:57.403 --> 49:58.772
he would send punishments.

49:59.471 --> 50:03.273
Famine, plague, hordes of
locusts,

50:03.275 --> 50:05.509
to drive his people back to
living

50:05.511 --> 50:06.913
like he wanted them to live.

50:08.414 --> 50:09.783
But it wouldn't last.

50:10.750 --> 50:14.754
Sooner or later, they'd give
into temptation and sin again.

50:15.889 --> 50:19.757
Of course, God could've forced
his will on the Israelites.

50:19.759 --> 50:23.660
Forced them to live on
the path of righteousness.

50:23.662 --> 50:24.929
But from the beginning,

50:24.931 --> 50:28.598
God has always wanted loving
disciples,

50:28.600 --> 50:31.805
serving of their own free
will, not mindless slaves.

50:33.672 --> 50:36.341
So, he sent a savior for them.

50:37.744 --> 50:38.745
For all of us.

50:39.211 --> 50:41.513
He sent his son, Jesus Christ.

50:43.582 --> 50:47.018
In the New Testament, Christ
teaches us,

50:47.020 --> 50:49.588
through his example and his
words,

50:50.389 --> 50:54.493
compassion, acceptance,
forgiveness.

50:55.360 --> 50:58.597
We learn that we are
forgiven through God's love.

50:59.999 --> 51:02.902
And we are expected to forgive
others,

51:03.702 --> 51:05.772
through our love for our fellow
man.

51:08.775 --> 51:10.808
Sometimes that's tough.

51:10.810 --> 51:13.345
It's easy to love those
that are good to us, right?

51:14.047 --> 51:17.683
But the folks that are not
so good to us, not so much.

51:20.920 --> 51:24.956
Loving your enemies enough to
forgive them brings us closer

51:24.958 --> 51:28.725
to living our lives the way
God wants us to live them,

51:28.727 --> 51:29.693
the way Jesus lived his life,

51:29.695 --> 51:33.432
and any other thing
that Christians can do.

51:34.733 --> 51:36.635
Let us pray today,

51:37.536 --> 51:42.041
for the strength, the grace
and the love to forgive.

51:49.648 --> 51:51.983
Allie, good morning,
hi.

51:51.985 --> 51:53.785
Morning.

51:53.787 --> 51:54.788
You're here early.

51:55.721 --> 51:56.790
Teacher work day.

51:59.625 --> 52:02.327
Allie, that was really
sweet, what you did.

52:03.963 --> 52:04.964
Friday.

52:06.065 --> 52:08.433
You didn't have to stay
all night with Mrs. Foster.

52:09.434 --> 52:10.435
How is she?

52:11.971 --> 52:13.940
Well, she's back and
resting.

52:14.808 --> 52:18.075
Doctors think it may
have been a mini stroke.

52:18.077 --> 52:19.944
She's had them before, but with
each one,

52:19.946 --> 52:21.948
it seems to take a little more
from her.

52:22.748 --> 52:26.083
What about her family, her
kids?

52:26.085 --> 52:26.984
From what she's told me,

52:26.986 --> 52:28.988
I don't think she could ever
have kids.

52:29.755 --> 52:31.825
Like many of our other
residents,

52:32.926 --> 52:34.626
we're pretty much all she has.

52:39.431 --> 52:40.432
You wanna see her?

53:03.655 --> 53:05.424
Sorry, did I wake you?

53:08.760 --> 53:09.761
You didn't.

53:11.064 --> 53:12.631
I'm glad you're feelin'
better.

53:20.106 --> 53:21.941
I didn't get the chance to tell
you, but,

53:24.077 --> 53:25.912
you have a really good singing
voice.

53:27.981 --> 53:28.982
Like...

53:29.748 --> 53:30.749
Amazing.

53:32.818 --> 53:37.221
I haven't used my voice like
that in...

53:37.223 --> 53:38.423
Forever.

53:39.591 --> 53:42.828
So, what were you, like
a real singer or something?

53:44.630 --> 53:45.631
Well...

53:47.499 --> 53:49.068
I had a couple of gigs.

53:51.104 --> 53:52.669
That's you?

53:52.671 --> 53:53.672
That's me.

53:55.008 --> 53:58.175
Your cute looks are gonna fade
too.

53:58.177 --> 54:01.948
That's not what I mean,
I mean, that's really cool.

54:03.149 --> 54:04.650
You were like famous.

54:06.119 --> 54:07.120
Who's that?

54:08.221 --> 54:11.556
That's the one.

54:13.825 --> 54:15.126
"The one?"

54:15.128 --> 54:16.928
My Tommy.

54:16.930 --> 54:18.064
The one I married.

54:19.966 --> 54:21.000
Like your soulmate?

54:23.069 --> 54:24.836
Love at first sight type stuff?

54:26.005 --> 54:28.640
There's no such thing.

54:30.143 --> 54:31.610
He had to work at it.

54:32.744 --> 54:35.079
He was the best looking man
around,

54:35.081 --> 54:38.051
but that didn't make him
forever-material.

54:39.518 --> 54:42.088
I didn't acknowledge him for a
long time.

54:43.789 --> 54:48.061
I wasn't
gonna marry just anybody.

54:51.563 --> 54:52.564
We were together,

54:54.100 --> 54:55.600
over 50 years.

54:57.236 --> 54:58.037
Wow.

55:05.979 --> 55:09.015
Sorry, I was just coming
to check in on you two.

55:09.915 --> 55:11.315
What you lookin' at?

55:11.317 --> 55:12.916
Did you know that Mrs. Foster

55:12.918 --> 55:15.152
used to be a professional
singer?

55:15.154 --> 55:17.823
Well, I had my suspicions.

55:19.125 --> 55:21.258
I came to see if you wanted any
lunch?

55:21.260 --> 55:23.194
I can have Jimmy bring it in.

55:23.196 --> 55:24.197
Okay.

55:30.569 --> 55:31.901
Wait, what?

55:31.903 --> 55:33.270
You're my two o'clock?

55:33.272 --> 55:35.139
That's us.

55:35.141 --> 55:38.075
- How you doin', Conner?
- Great, get onboard.

56:14.147 --> 56:16.149
Boat keeping you busy?

56:17.250 --> 56:19.017
Not as busy as I'd like, but,

56:20.952 --> 56:22.752
picked up a part-time recently.

56:22.754 --> 56:24.255
Yeah?

56:24.257 --> 56:26.591
A couple of late nights,
but it really helps.

56:27.793 --> 56:28.794
That's good.

56:29.628 --> 56:30.629
Real good.

56:31.897 --> 56:34.298
I know it's been kind of tough.

56:34.300 --> 56:35.965
Real seasonal around here.

56:35.967 --> 56:36.968
Got that right.

56:40.406 --> 56:41.973
Good to see you at church.

56:43.242 --> 56:44.243
Yeah.

56:46.011 --> 56:49.248
Yeah, it's uh,
it's been a while.

56:50.048 --> 56:54.253
Oh, you know, the only
reason I bring it up is 'cause

56:56.322 --> 56:58.124
just got back myself, last year.

56:59.057 --> 57:01.260
I don't even know how
long it had really been.

57:04.363 --> 57:06.665
And Annette was the
best, you know, she uh,

57:07.533 --> 57:11.268
she had real patience,
let's just say that.

57:11.270 --> 57:13.772
It wasn't anything like
phenomenal or like

57:14.606 --> 57:17.141
divine intervention or anything
like that.

57:17.143 --> 57:18.144
I just knew that,

57:20.179 --> 57:21.380
I needed to make a decision.

57:22.415 --> 57:25.284
You know, all-in, or all-out.

57:29.288 --> 57:33.292
And once I realized that God is
all-in,

57:34.926 --> 57:35.994
always was?

57:39.764 --> 57:40.765
The choice was easy.

57:45.238 --> 57:46.805
Come on, get one!

57:50.108 --> 57:52.245
Your kids doing all right?

57:53.945 --> 57:56.779
Just enjoy them when they're
young.

57:56.781 --> 57:59.651
Your girl, Alaska, right?

58:00.453 --> 58:03.189
She's gotta be about
college age, that right?

58:04.122 --> 58:07.391
Yeah, she's 18, but she
thinks that she's older.

58:07.393 --> 58:10.095
She's got a lot of growin' up to
do.

58:10.795 --> 58:12.996
I don't know about you, but,

58:12.998 --> 58:14.764
I still got a lot of
growing up to do, too.

58:17.236 --> 58:19.438
You like gotta get back anytime?

58:22.107 --> 58:23.108
Only if you want to.

58:24.377 --> 58:28.978
That's
what I'm talkin' about.

58:28.980 --> 58:29.981
That's good.

58:35.987 --> 58:38.455
It is my favorite color, come
on.

58:38.457 --> 58:39.258
It's true.

58:55.274 --> 58:56.139
You know, it's good

58:56.141 --> 58:57.310
to have you back among
the living, Als?

58:59.545 --> 59:00.477
I was thinking I

59:00.479 --> 59:02.845
might have to check myself
into a hotel soon.

59:02.847 --> 59:03.848
You guys.

59:04.950 --> 59:05.649
I'm touched.

59:05.651 --> 59:07.420
I don't know what's going on.

59:08.887 --> 59:10.153
Yeah, you wouldn't,
'cause you've only been

59:10.155 --> 59:12.090
in the picture for about five
minutes.

59:13.459 --> 59:15.091
That's harsh!

59:15.093 --> 59:19.162
It's all good.

59:19.164 --> 59:21.097
You guys ready to get outta
here?

59:21.099 --> 59:21.931
Yeah.

59:21.933 --> 59:22.899
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

59:22.901 --> 59:24.169
Yeah, let's go.

59:25.904 --> 59:28.307
All right, so Alaska, why
don't you ride with Derek?

59:29.408 --> 59:33.446
Derek's going with Thad, I
don't want you to be alone.

59:34.447 --> 59:35.281
I can take Thad.

59:36.382 --> 59:38.417
No, Amy, we came together.

59:39.217 --> 59:41.352
I don't see what the big deal
is.

59:41.354 --> 59:42.919
Derek hasn't seen you, I just
thought...

59:42.921 --> 59:44.457
No, you don't think!

59:45.991 --> 59:49.460
Alaska, come on!

59:49.462 --> 59:50.429
You're dead.

59:59.538 --> 01:00:03.309
I'm perfectly capable
of walking outside.

01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:21.460
I thought you wanted to enjoy
the view?

01:00:22.961 --> 01:00:25.928
I'm just checking something.

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:26.931
Mm-hm.

01:00:30.101 --> 01:00:31.402
Sorry.

01:00:31.404 --> 01:00:33.004
What's so important?

01:00:34.973 --> 01:00:37.909
Or should I say, who's so
important?

01:00:38.943 --> 01:00:40.344
Hm?

01:00:40.346 --> 01:00:41.347
You're right.

01:00:42.581 --> 01:00:43.382
It's nothing.

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:46.151
It's no one.

01:00:48.086 --> 01:00:49.322
Not important.

01:00:58.063 --> 01:00:59.064
Dad?

01:00:59.765 --> 01:01:00.997
You didn't see him outside?

01:01:00.999 --> 01:01:02.401
He just left.

01:01:05.638 --> 01:01:06.838
I'll be back.

01:01:08.574 --> 01:01:10.175
Thanks for warning.

01:01:58.557 --> 01:01:59.558
Hey!

01:02:01.394 --> 01:02:02.395
Hey!

01:02:03.161 --> 01:02:04.162
Saturday?

01:02:04.996 --> 01:02:07.598
Pretty sure the whole
street's still sleeping!

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.134
Was sleeping.

01:02:40.466 --> 01:02:43.067
Those hours really crept on me.

01:02:44.035 --> 01:02:46.472
Didn't realize they were gonna
be so fast.

01:02:47.606 --> 01:02:48.973
Guess I was here a lot.

01:02:49.742 --> 01:02:51.544
You did your time, yeah.

01:02:53.512 --> 01:02:56.414
Didn't really feel
all that much like jail.

01:02:58.617 --> 01:03:00.619
Well, maybe at first, but...

01:03:01.419 --> 01:03:05.691
You need to get back to
your school, your life.

01:03:07.726 --> 01:03:10.629
Doesn't mean I can't visit
every once in a while, right?

01:03:16.735 --> 01:03:21.540
- Mrs. Foster?
- Tommy?

01:03:21.807 --> 01:03:23.007
Tommy?

01:03:23.742 --> 01:03:27.176
What's going on, are you okay?

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.078
Where is this?

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.413
Okay, okay.

01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:32.448
It's okay, we're gonna get you
home.

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:33.686
We're gonna get you back.

01:03:35.588 --> 01:03:36.589
Okay.

01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:39.658
I know you, I know you.

01:03:41.727 --> 01:03:42.728
I know you.

01:03:46.599 --> 01:03:48.699
I'm bringing Mrs. Foster back
in.

01:03:48.701 --> 01:03:50.101
Something's happening.

01:03:54.607 --> 01:03:56.640
Nothing much we can do for
her during these episodes,

01:03:56.642 --> 01:03:58.276
except make her comfortable.

01:04:02.146 --> 01:04:05.751
Not a good last day, I know,
but she'll be okay, really.

01:04:08.854 --> 01:04:10.556
You can always come back and
visit.

01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:16.127
I'll sign off on your
paperwork before you leave.

01:04:17.763 --> 01:04:18.631
Mrs. Foster?

01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:23.134
I'd like to see you
spend more time outside.

01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:27.638
Moving around, visiting with
people.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.339
Being energetic.

01:04:30.341 --> 01:04:32.277
Now, we've talked about this
before.

01:04:33.278 --> 01:04:34.279
Hm.

01:04:35.179 --> 01:04:36.247
If you say so!

01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:38.784
Yeah, well...

01:04:40.553 --> 01:04:41.720
It'll come back to you.

01:04:43.722 --> 01:04:45.624
When will it come back to me?

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:48.727
I'll tell you what.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:52.430
Next time you can't remember
something,

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:58.236
whether it's an event, a date or
a name,

01:04:59.304 --> 01:05:04.509
I'd like to see you take a
deep breath, close your eyes,

01:05:06.244 --> 01:05:11.249
and connect with the feeling
of what you can't remember.

01:05:12.051 --> 01:05:14.218
Do you think you can do that for
us?

01:05:16.889 --> 01:05:18.122
If you say so.

01:05:22.928 --> 01:05:26.262
Sorry, am I
interrupting something?

01:05:26.264 --> 01:05:27.798
No.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.734
We're done here.

01:05:30.769 --> 01:05:32.270
All right, so,

01:05:34.572 --> 01:05:36.840
I'm Dr. Nelson.

01:05:36.842 --> 01:05:38.274
What's your name?

01:05:38.276 --> 01:05:39.710
Alaska Rose.

01:05:39.712 --> 01:05:40.611
Oh!

01:05:40.613 --> 01:05:43.647
You're Alaska, I heard much
about you.

01:05:43.649 --> 01:05:47.784
You're doing a fine job for us,
thank you.

01:05:47.786 --> 01:05:48.787
Thank you.

01:05:50.756 --> 01:05:51.724
Mrs. Foster?

01:05:52.958 --> 01:05:55.859
We'll be talking, and oh,

01:05:55.861 --> 01:05:58.429
remember to take your meds.

01:05:59.932 --> 01:06:01.132
All right, see ya.

01:06:09.908 --> 01:06:12.645
You're not here to sell
me something, are you?

01:06:13.812 --> 01:06:15.179
It's me, Alaska.

01:06:18.651 --> 01:06:19.752
You remember me, right?

01:06:23.321 --> 01:06:24.955
You remember.

01:06:24.957 --> 01:06:26.157
I remember.

01:06:28.593 --> 01:06:33.464
I remember you used to
like to touch my things.

01:06:34.767 --> 01:06:36.735
You just have such cool
things.

01:06:41.707 --> 01:06:44.975
I wanted to thank you.

01:06:44.977 --> 01:06:46.177
For what?

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.554
For being my friend.

01:07:00.025 --> 01:07:01.559
We're friends.

01:07:03.294 --> 01:07:05.630
I'll see you, Mrs. Foster.

01:07:08.299 --> 01:07:09.300
See you.

01:07:12.437 --> 01:07:13.438
Alaska.

01:07:33.025 --> 01:07:34.225
Alaska, wait up.

01:07:36.661 --> 01:07:39.297
I never heard back from
you, freak, what's up?

01:07:40.631 --> 01:07:41.664
I've just been busy.

01:07:41.666 --> 01:07:42.667
All weekend?

01:07:43.969 --> 01:07:45.802
So, what's the deal with you and
Derek?

01:07:45.804 --> 01:07:47.605
He hasn't been answering
his phone, either.

01:07:56.949 --> 01:07:57.950
Is that you?

01:07:59.084 --> 01:08:00.284
No way.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.320
I don't know what you're
talking about.

01:08:14.499 --> 01:08:15.500
Miss Rose.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.901
It's about time you arrived.

01:08:17.903 --> 01:08:19.437
Close the door and have a seat.

01:08:20.973 --> 01:08:22.273
What's going on?

01:08:23.942 --> 01:08:25.510
Sit down, please.

01:08:29.447 --> 01:08:30.645
The officer would like to ask
you

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:32.683
some questions about an
incident.

01:08:33.886 --> 01:08:35.020
Your name is Alaska Rose?

01:08:37.055 --> 01:08:38.720
Yeah.

01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:42.058
I'm Officer Brennan,
you've seen me around, right?

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:43.794
Yes?

01:08:43.796 --> 01:08:46.796
I wanna ask you a
question about an incident

01:08:46.799 --> 01:08:48.599
that took place a couple nights
ago.

01:08:49.935 --> 01:08:50.935
"An incident?"

01:08:51.804 --> 01:08:54.404
What is your relationship
with Derek Austin?

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.975
Were you with this guy on the
12th?

01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:00.676
Can I have my dad here for
this?

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:01.779
You're 18, right?

01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:05.349
Yeah.

01:09:06.018 --> 01:09:07.785
Were you with the boy or not?

01:09:08.653 --> 01:09:09.921
He gave me a ride home.

01:09:11.622 --> 01:09:12.622
Is that it?

01:09:13.758 --> 01:09:15.457
Yeah, that's it.

01:09:15.459 --> 01:09:16.460
Alaska.

01:09:17.129 --> 01:09:19.462
This is a very serious matter.

01:09:20.731 --> 01:09:23.035
This boy claims you assaulted
him.

01:09:25.136 --> 01:09:26.939
I assaulted him?

01:09:27.604 --> 01:09:30.639
He claims that you hit
him repeatedly in the face

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:33.944
and the head with a hard object,
until he was unconscious.

01:09:33.946 --> 01:09:36.745
He also claims that you
took $100 from his wallet

01:09:36.747 --> 01:09:37.916
and fled the scene.

01:09:38.582 --> 01:09:42.484
The hard object was my fist.

01:09:42.486 --> 01:09:44.720
You admit to the assault?

01:09:44.721 --> 01:09:46.622
I hit him, yeah.

01:09:46.624 --> 01:09:48.093
Yeah, but he deserved it!

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.728
What happened?

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:52.930
He was giving me a ride home,

01:09:55.067 --> 01:09:56.801
and he told me he wanted to
talk.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.471
And I said I had to go home, but
okay.

01:10:04.042 --> 01:10:07.476
Then we went to the beach
and he started acting

01:10:07.478 --> 01:10:09.580
like he didn't just wanna talk.

01:10:11.116 --> 01:10:14.817
And then he leaned in to
kiss me, and I said no,

01:10:14.819 --> 01:10:17.022
and he did it anyway, so I
punched him!

01:10:18.456 --> 01:10:19.657
And I went home.

01:10:20.725 --> 01:10:24.897
He put his hands on
you, at all, or anything?

01:10:26.198 --> 01:10:27.398
No.

01:10:28.233 --> 01:10:30.233
But you did strike him?

01:10:30.235 --> 01:10:32.002
Did you go into his wallet?

01:10:32.004 --> 01:10:33.105
Of course not.

01:10:34.006 --> 01:10:37.107
He has a witness to
corroborate his story.

01:10:37.109 --> 01:10:40.676
That's impossible, we were
completely alone, what witness?

01:10:40.678 --> 01:10:43.115
Look, I'm not going to make an
arrest,

01:10:44.216 --> 01:10:46.182
but I have to file this charge.

01:10:46.184 --> 01:10:49.652
This is insane, I didn't
even do anything wrong!

01:10:49.654 --> 01:10:51.087
Calm down.

01:10:51.089 --> 01:10:52.155
He's a liar.

01:10:52.157 --> 01:10:55.992
We're gonna have to just
let the courts decide.

01:10:55.994 --> 01:10:56.995
No.

01:10:58.729 --> 01:11:00.763
I can't get in anymore trouble.

01:11:00.765 --> 01:11:01.766
Alaska.

01:11:02.833 --> 01:11:04.600
He has injuries.

01:11:04.602 --> 01:11:06.972
You just spontaneously
admitted to the assault.

01:11:08.639 --> 01:11:09.638
Now, you will get a summons,

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.776
and you'll just have to
show up at court, okay?

01:11:12.743 --> 01:11:16.148
Please, listen to me, I really,
I can't go back to court.

01:11:17.515 --> 01:11:19.084
Thank you, Principal.

01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:25.255
You, you don't understand,
please, I, Miss Gray?

01:11:25.257 --> 01:11:27.958
It's out of my hands, Alaska.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.827
His parents are pushing the
issue.

01:11:55.287 --> 01:11:57.220
Mrs. Foster?

01:11:57.222 --> 01:11:58.587
Sorry.

01:12:05.263 --> 01:12:06.664
What are you doing?

01:12:14.805 --> 01:12:16.607
I thought you were finished
here?

01:12:18.976 --> 01:12:19.977
Why'd you come?

01:12:23.015 --> 01:12:24.016
No.

01:12:25.816 --> 01:12:26.817
No.

01:12:31.123 --> 01:12:33.889
It's, it's not all that
tragic.

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:35.960
Look what you're doing!

01:12:40.265 --> 01:12:41.066
I...

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.102
I started taking these.

01:12:45.203 --> 01:12:47.239
I don't remember when.

01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:54.112
Sometimes, you have to,

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.149
make things better.

01:13:00.118 --> 01:13:01.217
For everyone.

01:13:01.219 --> 01:13:02.220
No.

01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:04.222
It's not better!

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:06.791
It's never better.

01:13:10.295 --> 01:13:14.132
You gave me, you gave
me ever-so-good last days.

01:13:17.069 --> 01:13:18.070
You can't.

01:13:20.338 --> 01:13:21.639
You can't do this to me.

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:24.309
You can't go away, too.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.747
Get a hold of yourself, girl.

01:13:31.249 --> 01:13:32.250
I was 13.

01:13:35.353 --> 01:13:39.757
I was 13 years old when I found
my mom.

01:13:41.259 --> 01:13:42.827
I found her!

01:13:43.828 --> 01:13:45.062
I had to be the one!

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.399
I was just getting home from
school,

01:13:49.401 --> 01:13:51.969
and I wanted to show her
how good I did on my paper.

01:13:54.239 --> 01:13:56.941
I thought I'd make her
happy and she was always...

01:14:00.378 --> 01:14:02.079
She was always so sad.

01:14:08.453 --> 01:14:09.653
I kept calling,

01:14:11.323 --> 01:14:13.755
and calling and calling
and calling for her,

01:14:13.757 --> 01:14:15.092
but she wouldn't answer me.

01:14:18.296 --> 01:14:20.132
And then I looked in the
bathroom.

01:14:24.768 --> 01:14:26.269
And she filled it up with hot
water,

01:14:26.271 --> 01:14:29.241
so that she wouldn't make a
mess.

01:14:34.945 --> 01:14:35.946
I...

01:14:36.448 --> 01:14:37.648
Found her.

01:14:41.986 --> 01:14:43.654
And I found her too late.

01:14:46.924 --> 01:14:48.393
I couldn't stop her.

01:14:52.062 --> 01:14:55.731
I couldn't stop her.

01:14:55.733 --> 01:14:59.304
Please, Mrs. Foster,
please, don't do this.

01:15:01.473 --> 01:15:05.408
Please, Mrs. Foster, please,
don't make me live that again.

01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:09.811
Please.

01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:22.126
Her hair was so soft.

01:15:24.128 --> 01:15:25.162
It was like silk.

01:15:26.331 --> 01:15:29.434
I always imagined it'd be what
angel hair would feel like.

01:15:30.801 --> 01:15:32.102
And she had this laugh.

01:15:33.205 --> 01:15:36.774
It was so high-pitched that
it made everybody else laugh.

01:15:40.378 --> 01:15:43.415
And then one day, she
just stopped laughing.

01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:47.918
I always thought it
was when we moved here.

01:15:50.154 --> 01:15:51.256
And I hated this place.

01:15:52.122 --> 01:15:54.992
I think I hated it because
I thought it made her sad.

01:15:56.827 --> 01:15:59.163
Or maybe she was so sad because
I was sad.

01:16:01.799 --> 01:16:02.900
I don't know.

01:16:04.969 --> 01:16:06.471
Don't blame yourself.

01:16:08.473 --> 01:16:09.274
I don't.

01:16:11.842 --> 01:16:14.310
My dad's the one that forced us
here.

01:16:14.312 --> 01:16:16.446
He spent all our money
on some stupid boat,

01:16:16.448 --> 01:16:18.348
and then he wanted to start a
business,

01:16:18.350 --> 01:16:20.916
but when we got here, there were
like

01:16:20.918 --> 01:16:23.754
15,000 other businesses just
like it.

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:28.424
We were always behind on bills.

01:16:28.426 --> 01:16:30.058
We never had enough to get by,

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:33.429
and my mom was always talking
about it.

01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:36.432
And I tried to help, I would
watch my little brother

01:16:36.434 --> 01:16:38.769
so she wasn't so overwhelmed all
the time.

01:16:41.905 --> 01:16:43.341
But Dad was never there.

01:16:45.075 --> 01:16:46.076
Working?

01:16:47.111 --> 01:16:48.112
All the time.

01:16:49.547 --> 01:16:50.548
Hm.

01:16:51.782 --> 01:16:54.517
It's like he couldn't comprehend
what was even happening.

01:16:54.519 --> 01:16:56.354
He couldn't see what he'd
caused.

01:16:57.187 --> 01:17:02.394
I mean, we left our home, our
life, our friends, everything.

01:17:04.962 --> 01:17:07.131
He couldn't even see
how miserable she was.

01:17:09.401 --> 01:17:13.569
I'm no expert, but I
suspect there was more

01:17:13.571 --> 01:17:16.308
to your mom being sad than just
that.

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:22.480
Have you ever thought about
how it made your father feel?

01:17:23.548 --> 01:17:26.318
What it must be like for him,
no?

01:17:34.124 --> 01:17:35.292
Can I, uh...

01:17:36.328 --> 01:17:37.329
See that?

01:18:03.621 --> 01:18:04.622
Thanks.

01:18:08.493 --> 01:18:11.461
Do you wanna come a
drive for some ice cream?

01:18:11.463 --> 01:18:14.064
It's the best cure for feeling
like crap.

01:18:17.267 --> 01:18:18.300
Okay.

01:18:18.302 --> 01:18:19.870
Can I change?

01:18:20.472 --> 01:18:23.639
Conner, thank you so much
for agreeing to work with our

01:18:23.641 --> 01:18:27.142
youth program, you know, I
think those kids are gonna

01:18:27.144 --> 01:18:29.177
benefit from it, but you know
what else?

01:18:29.179 --> 01:18:30.180
You are, too.

01:18:31.449 --> 01:18:32.650
Win-win blessing.

01:18:33.618 --> 01:18:35.451
Thank you.

01:18:35.453 --> 01:18:36.454
Thanks, Bishop.

01:18:40.224 --> 01:18:42.290
Anything else on your mind?

01:18:42.292 --> 01:18:44.294
Something I'd be able to help
with?

01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:46.631
Well, I...

01:18:51.569 --> 01:18:55.407
I haven't really talked about it
since.

01:18:59.143 --> 01:19:00.144
It's okay, buddy.

01:19:01.646 --> 01:19:02.913
That's what I'm here for.

01:19:09.253 --> 01:19:10.588
How can I, um...

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.225
How is there peace after...

01:19:20.598 --> 01:19:21.464
One of our favorite hymns is

01:19:21.466 --> 01:19:23.967
"Families Can Be Together
Forever."

01:19:29.607 --> 01:19:31.576
How do I help my children,

01:19:32.409 --> 01:19:34.479
if their parents aren't gonna be
together?

01:19:37.114 --> 01:19:38.115
Conner.

01:19:39.551 --> 01:19:42.618
I can't even begin to imagine
what you've been through.

01:19:44.622 --> 01:19:47.692
The burden you've had to carry.

01:19:49.661 --> 01:19:52.595
Someone you love takes
their own life, just,

01:19:52.597 --> 01:19:56.534
just leaves behind so much
pain, so many questions.

01:19:59.504 --> 01:20:02.339
But Conner, God loves you.

01:20:03.608 --> 01:20:06.176
He feels every bit of your pain.

01:20:11.415 --> 01:20:12.584
Everything I've read,

01:20:14.686 --> 01:20:17.120
everything I feel, it's murder.

01:20:20.057 --> 01:20:21.058
Is she lost?

01:20:24.261 --> 01:20:25.630
Let me ask you a question.

01:20:28.098 --> 01:20:33.103
You ever wonder why
repentance is taught so often,

01:20:33.605 --> 01:20:35.640
so lovingly, especially
in the New Testament?

01:20:36.406 --> 01:20:41.176
You know, a part of
repentance is recognizing

01:20:41.178 --> 01:20:43.447
that you've sinned in
the first place, right?

01:20:44.649 --> 01:20:47.315
Isn't it reasonable to believe
that

01:20:47.317 --> 01:20:50.452
somebody who would be
in such a state of mind,

01:20:50.454 --> 01:20:52.790
to decide to end their own life,

01:20:53.490 --> 01:20:57.762
might not even be able to
recognize that they'd sinned?

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:04.165
I think, ultimately, only
God has the answer, Conner.

01:21:04.167 --> 01:21:08.438
But God is a god of
love, not of punishment.

01:21:09.707 --> 01:21:13.711
He would never abandon
one of his children,

01:21:14.812 --> 01:21:16.614
in her greatest hour of need.

01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:19.751
Romans 8 tells us,

01:21:20.552 --> 01:21:24.756
"Nothing will separate
us from the love of God."

01:21:25.657 --> 01:21:26.658
Nothing.

01:21:28.593 --> 01:21:31.596
Nothing will separate you
from the love of the Father.

01:21:55.485 --> 01:21:56.788
Dad, I need to talk to you.

01:22:02.259 --> 01:22:04.662
I'm almost done with my
community service hours.

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:08.165
Well, it's about time, that's
good.

01:22:08.866 --> 01:22:11.401
Now we can get to thinking
about college again.

01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:14.571
Yeah.

01:22:17.742 --> 01:22:18.810
Is there somethin' else?

01:22:20.645 --> 01:22:23.413
Somebody lied about
me and called the cops.

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:27.584
Okay, what happened?

01:22:28.585 --> 01:22:30.418
I don't know.

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:33.488
I really don't know, I was
just trying to get a ride home,

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:38.493
and I was with Amy and I ended
up with this guy named Derek.

01:22:38.495 --> 01:22:39.795
And who's Derek?

01:22:39.797 --> 01:22:41.264
He's my friend.

01:22:43.668 --> 01:22:45.670
Or at least, I thought he was my
friend.

01:22:46.971 --> 01:22:49.805
And Amy just left me there,

01:22:49.807 --> 01:22:52.275
and I was stuck in the car with
him.

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:55.510
And?

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:59.149
I punched him in the
face, and like a lot.

01:23:01.318 --> 01:23:02.885
What?

01:23:02.887 --> 01:23:05.387
Did he touch you, are you hurt?

01:23:05.389 --> 01:23:07.491
No, no, I would've broke his
arm, but...

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.762
Now he's lying about me,

01:23:11.829 --> 01:23:15.298
and he's saying all this stuff
and he called the police.

01:23:18.936 --> 01:23:22.337
I have a court date.

01:23:22.339 --> 01:23:26.744
I can't get in anymore trouble
and I'm, I'm really scared.

01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:32.182
The judge is gonna send me to
jail and I'm really scared.

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:34.819
Okay, okay, okay.

01:23:37.855 --> 01:23:38.856
Sit down.

01:23:52.837 --> 01:23:54.103
All right.

01:23:54.105 --> 01:23:58.573
If you go into that court room
and you are completely honest

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:00.876
it's all gonna work out.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:03.781
That's not the point.

01:24:04.916 --> 01:24:06.818
That judge hates me.

01:24:07.617 --> 01:24:10.585
She's gonna put me away the
minute I walk in that courthouse

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:11.923
and she said it herself.

01:24:15.993 --> 01:24:19.762
What do I do?

01:24:19.764 --> 01:24:20.898
What'll I do?

01:24:25.803 --> 01:24:26.804
Pray?

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:30.940
That's easy for you to say,
you didn't just throw away

01:24:30.942 --> 01:24:34.344
two months of your life to
go to jail for how-long.

01:24:38.883 --> 01:24:41.551
I'm not the one who made
the choices that you made.

01:24:42.652 --> 01:24:45.255
Alaska, decisions have
consequences.

01:24:47.591 --> 01:24:48.592
What?

01:24:51.996 --> 01:24:56.801
You don't think I know that
decisions have consequences?

01:24:59.804 --> 01:25:04.474
You think anyone in this
family doesn't know that?

01:25:07.011 --> 01:25:09.677
I'm sorry.

01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:11.615
I'm sorry, that's not...

01:25:17.054 --> 01:25:18.055
I'm sorry.

01:25:20.091 --> 01:25:21.291
Allie?

01:25:27.731 --> 01:25:28.732
Allie.

01:25:29.599 --> 01:25:30.600
Allie.

01:25:38.642 --> 01:25:40.310
I know you blame me.

01:25:43.613 --> 01:25:46.918
I can't get it out of my head.

01:25:58.461 --> 01:25:59.931
Why would she do it?

01:26:01.032 --> 01:26:04.834
Why would she do that if she
knew

01:26:04.836 --> 01:26:09.339
that I was gonna be the one
to come home and find her?

01:26:10.942 --> 01:26:15.777
Why would she do that?

01:26:15.779 --> 01:26:18.948
Why would she do that,
why would she do that?

01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:20.115
She left me.

01:26:20.117 --> 01:26:22.918
If she knew this, why would she
do that?

01:26:24.588 --> 01:26:27.189
She still loves us, she still
loves us.

01:26:27.191 --> 01:26:31.894
Why would she do that?

01:26:31.896 --> 01:26:33.563
I don't hate my mom.

01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:37.799
I don't hate my mom, I don't
hate my mom.

01:26:37.801 --> 01:26:39.469
I don't hate my mom.

01:26:44.108 --> 01:26:45.109
Oh, honey.

01:26:55.452 --> 01:26:57.420
We're gonna get through this,
okay?

01:26:59.123 --> 01:27:00.557
Somehow...

01:27:03.094 --> 01:27:04.594
We are gonna get through this.

01:27:05.829 --> 01:27:06.830
Where's Kyle?

01:27:07.831 --> 01:27:08.696
Why can't he hear me?

01:27:08.698 --> 01:27:12.036
Oh, he's at a friend's house
tonight.

01:27:14.238 --> 01:27:18.040
Brat.

01:27:18.042 --> 01:27:19.942
You can exchange
punches with him tomorrow,

01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:21.078
when he gets back.

01:27:28.119 --> 01:27:30.654
You're gonna get through
this court thing, too.

01:27:31.655 --> 01:27:32.656
I promise.

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:36.994
If I do...

01:27:39.796 --> 01:27:42.099
Will you make sure that
we do more stuff together?

01:27:44.135 --> 01:27:45.136
Yeah.

01:27:47.038 --> 01:27:48.039
Promise?

01:27:50.274 --> 01:27:52.509
Promise, we need to.

01:27:59.116 --> 01:28:01.052
Allie, um...

01:28:04.721 --> 01:28:06.958
Oh, nevermind, it's stupid.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:10.658
What's wrong?

01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.129
I just, um...

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:17.299
You know, your mom and I,
we had the talk with you

01:28:17.301 --> 01:28:19.203
when you were little and I just,
I...

01:28:22.239 --> 01:28:25.109
I wish that she would be
here for the follow-up.

01:28:27.244 --> 01:28:28.079
"The talk?"

01:28:30.847 --> 01:28:33.282
Well, I know, I try
not to think about it.

01:28:33.284 --> 01:28:35.217
I don't even like to think about
it,

01:28:35.219 --> 01:28:38.755
but you're out all night,
you're with your friends.

01:28:40.091 --> 01:28:41.092
Your friends.

01:28:44.594 --> 01:28:45.793
Look at me.

01:28:48.099 --> 01:28:50.767
I wanted so much more for you.

01:28:53.237 --> 01:28:56.271
And I remember that
promise that you made to me

01:28:56.273 --> 01:28:58.042
when you were little.

01:29:00.111 --> 01:29:01.112
Never.

01:29:02.146 --> 01:29:03.147
Okay?

01:29:05.216 --> 01:29:07.251
I never forget my promises.

01:29:28.605 --> 01:29:29.606
Hello?

01:29:30.807 --> 01:29:33.110
Allie, good morning,
I hope it's not too early.

01:29:34.145 --> 01:29:35.146
It's always too early.

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.281
Gotta get up for school
though anyway, what's up?

01:29:39.283 --> 01:29:40.782
I know you're
finished here,

01:29:40.784 --> 01:29:42.384
I just thought you should know,

01:29:42.386 --> 01:29:45.122
Mrs. Foster was taken to the
hospital again last night.

01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:47.991
What's wrong?

01:29:49.126 --> 01:29:51.160
She hasn't been
able to breathe very well.

01:29:51.162 --> 01:29:52.827
They think she has fluid in her
lungs,

01:29:52.829 --> 01:29:55.266
but they need to run some tests.

01:29:57.234 --> 01:29:58.668
Where is she?

01:30:18.222 --> 01:30:21.756
No.

01:30:21.758 --> 01:30:23.827
You're not gonna do this.

01:30:25.229 --> 01:30:28.230
You're not gonna pull some
passive-aggressive hack,

01:30:28.232 --> 01:30:30.234
just to do what you wanted to do
before.

01:30:31.302 --> 01:30:32.303
Okay?

01:30:33.404 --> 01:30:34.904
You promised me.

01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:43.845
I mean, not in so many words,
but,

01:30:43.847 --> 01:30:45.949
you promised you'd never
think like that again.

01:30:50.753 --> 01:30:52.356
After everything I shared with
you.

01:30:55.126 --> 01:30:56.260
Everything we talked about.

01:30:57.394 --> 01:30:59.196
You know you promised.

01:31:07.937 --> 01:31:09.371
Look, I...

01:31:09.373 --> 01:31:13.107
I get it now.

01:31:13.109 --> 01:31:14.911
The world doesn't revolve around
me.

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:19.916
But it doesn't revolve around
you, either.

01:31:23.119 --> 01:31:24.654
I need you to wanna live.

01:31:29.058 --> 01:31:30.059
You're not alone.

01:31:32.263 --> 01:31:33.297
None of us are alone.

01:31:38.968 --> 01:31:43.838
Look, I know you can hear me.

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.243
I need you to tell me you wanna
live.

01:31:49.413 --> 01:31:51.448
Show me somethin', Mrs. Foster.

01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:56.253
Even if it's just to get
me out of your business.

01:31:59.122 --> 01:32:01.292
I need you to tell me you wanna
live.

01:32:03.126 --> 01:32:04.127
Please.

01:32:12.403 --> 01:32:13.404
There it is.

01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:17.408
I knew you were in there.

01:32:18.409 --> 01:32:20.244
I knew you could hear me.

01:32:23.414 --> 01:32:24.415
It's okay.

01:32:25.216 --> 01:32:28.450
You're okay, everything's gonna
be okay.

01:33:40.424 --> 01:33:41.425
Bay Rose Tours.

01:33:43.126 --> 01:33:45.228
Oops, I think
I have the wrong number.

01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:49.096
No, sorry, it's Allie.

01:33:49.098 --> 01:33:50.465
Oh.

01:33:50.467 --> 01:33:53.335
I'm just at work, I
picked up the wrong phone.

01:33:53.337 --> 01:33:56.172
Okay, you wanted
me to keep you updated.

01:33:58.074 --> 01:34:01.077
Yeah, how is Miss Foster, is
she okay?

01:34:03.314 --> 01:34:05.416
They're not
sure, Allie, I'm sorry.

01:34:06.215 --> 01:34:10.452
The pneumonia's worse,
it could go either way.

01:34:10.454 --> 01:34:12.922
"Either way," what is
that supposed to mean?

01:34:15.158 --> 01:34:18.495
I'm sorry, we
just have to be ready.

01:34:46.623 --> 01:34:49.256
Wait a minute, will ya?

01:34:49.258 --> 01:34:50.993
Dad, we talked about this.

01:34:51.994 --> 01:34:53.595
It's gonna be okay.

01:34:53.597 --> 01:34:55.164
It's not that easy, Allie.

01:34:57.568 --> 01:34:58.569
It's just...

01:35:02.972 --> 01:35:05.241
I haven't done anything
like this in years.

01:35:06.309 --> 01:35:11.515
I don't know if I'm ready, I
don't know if I'm, you know.

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:16.618
I think you're ready.

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.254
Isn't that all that matters?

01:35:21.692 --> 01:35:23.159
And through your faith,

01:35:26.597 --> 01:35:28.998
you may be healed of any
affliction.

01:35:32.703 --> 01:35:35.138
Your Heavenly Father knows you
personally.

01:35:37.674 --> 01:35:39.075
He knows of your needs,

01:35:40.309 --> 01:35:42.078
and of your righteous desires.

01:35:44.481 --> 01:35:47.551
He has sent his son to atone for
us all.

01:35:50.454 --> 01:35:53.557
That through him, we might all
be saved.

01:35:59.262 --> 01:36:01.532
You are blessed with this pure
knowledge,

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.634
and the perfect knowledge
that, through faith,

01:36:05.636 --> 01:36:07.270
all things are possible.

01:36:11.174 --> 01:36:12.509
Mountains are moved.

01:36:15.712 --> 01:36:17.648
And the hardest of hearts,
melted,

01:36:22.786 --> 01:36:24.053
and sanctified.

01:36:30.727 --> 01:36:32.228
You are blessed.

01:36:33.564 --> 01:36:36.265
Even now, this very moment,

01:36:38.234 --> 01:36:39.302
to be healed,

01:36:40.604 --> 01:36:42.438
and to rise from this bed.

01:36:44.708 --> 01:36:48.679
That you may walk by your own
power.

01:36:50.714 --> 01:36:52.714
That you may have joy in this
life,

01:36:52.716 --> 01:36:55.619
and feel the love of
your father in heaven.

01:36:58.589 --> 01:37:01.157
And the love of all of us around
you.

01:37:10.433 --> 01:37:13.637
And I leave this blessing upon
your head,

01:37:16.072 --> 01:37:17.741
in the name of Jesus Christ.

01:37:20.109 --> 01:37:21.342
Amen.

01:37:46.435 --> 01:37:47.436
Be seated.

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:57.712
Our first case is a violation
of a pre-trial agreement.

01:37:57.714 --> 01:38:00.549
Regional charge was illegal
possession of alcohol

01:38:00.551 --> 01:38:02.784
and ID fraud.

01:38:02.786 --> 01:38:04.655
Alaska Rose, are you here?

01:38:15.766 --> 01:38:17.264
Do you remember what I told you

01:38:17.266 --> 01:38:18.769
the last time you stood before
me?

01:38:19.903 --> 01:38:21.103
Yes, ma'am.

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:25.072
Well, that's good.

01:38:25.074 --> 01:38:27.176
So none of this should come as a
surprise.

01:38:28.045 --> 01:38:31.545
You are facing two months
on the original charges,

01:38:31.547 --> 01:38:34.450
and up to a year on
this latest allegation.

01:38:38.287 --> 01:38:39.288
Ma'am?

01:38:41.223 --> 01:38:42.224
Ma'am.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.161
Mrs. Foster?

01:38:46.429 --> 01:38:48.462
Miss Rose, who is
this?

01:38:48.464 --> 01:38:50.433
I'm your key witness.

01:38:51.768 --> 01:38:53.604
Witness for what,
ma'am?

01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:56.236
This isn't a trial.

01:38:56.238 --> 01:38:57.708
Now, if you'll please be seated.

01:38:58.609 --> 01:39:01.643
You mean to tell me
you sentenced this girl

01:39:01.645 --> 01:39:02.646
without a trial?

01:39:03.579 --> 01:39:05.245
Her sentence is already set.

01:39:05.247 --> 01:39:07.616
She violated the terms of
her pre-trial agreement

01:39:07.618 --> 01:39:09.951
by being charged with another
crime.

01:39:09.953 --> 01:39:13.287
Now, unless you're an attorney
with a license to practice in

01:39:13.289 --> 01:39:16.660
this jurisdiction, I would
kindly ask you to take a seat.

01:39:18.962 --> 01:39:20.762
No.

01:39:20.764 --> 01:39:22.664
I'm not a lawyer.

01:39:22.666 --> 01:39:23.667
I'm just a friend.

01:39:25.301 --> 01:39:28.870
Now, that might not have
much weight here today,

01:39:28.872 --> 01:39:33.474
but I have to believe that
character

01:39:33.476 --> 01:39:36.845
means something in this
courtroom.

01:39:36.847 --> 01:39:40.280
I agree, it is the sum
total of our choices,

01:39:40.282 --> 01:39:42.616
which make up our character.

01:39:42.618 --> 01:39:45.386
Which is why Miss Rose is here
today.

01:39:45.388 --> 01:39:47.758
Because of some of the
choices that she's made.

01:39:48.557 --> 01:39:50.661
Well, what about about the
other ones?

01:39:51.828 --> 01:39:53.061
Pardon me?

01:39:53.063 --> 01:39:58.232
Well, you said she's here
because of some of her choices.

01:39:58.234 --> 01:40:00.401
What about the other ones?

01:40:00.403 --> 01:40:02.471
I think I've been very patient
with you.

01:40:04.407 --> 01:40:07.676
Oh, you don't know patience,

01:40:07.678 --> 01:40:12.683
until you have experienced
constipation, in your late 80s.

01:40:14.818 --> 01:40:16.951
What is your name, ma'am?

01:40:16.953 --> 01:40:19.255
Julianna Foster.

01:40:20.791 --> 01:40:21.890
What is it that you're wanting

01:40:21.892 --> 01:40:23.392
to say to this
court, Miss Foster?

01:40:25.327 --> 01:40:27.263
I only know this girl,

01:40:27.931 --> 01:40:30.801
because she was forced into my
life.

01:40:33.502 --> 01:40:35.669
And what put her there?

01:40:35.671 --> 01:40:36.805
You?

01:40:36.807 --> 01:40:38.307
This court system?

01:40:39.743 --> 01:40:40.875
Yeah.

01:40:40.877 --> 01:40:41.878
Maybe.

01:40:43.612 --> 01:40:47.716
But the real reason that caused
her showin' up in my room,

01:40:47.718 --> 01:40:52.288
and gratin' on my nerves,
is because of her choices.

01:40:53.857 --> 01:40:58.795
You see, I believe that
everything happens for a reason.

01:40:59.996 --> 01:41:04.665
Now, my mind isn't always that
good,

01:41:04.667 --> 01:41:07.736
and things get kinda sketchy
sometimes,

01:41:07.738 --> 01:41:10.841
but there are some things
that I never forget.

01:41:12.475 --> 01:41:15.409
Like the day before Alaska
showed up.

01:41:15.411 --> 01:41:17.279
I had made up my mind.

01:41:18.247 --> 01:41:23.452
I had decided that life had
given me all it had to give me,

01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.922
and I was going to end it.

01:41:33.096 --> 01:41:35.864
Now, I'm not gonna get
all religious on you,

01:41:35.866 --> 01:41:39.301
because I've never really
been a church-goin' woman,

01:41:40.503 --> 01:41:43.039
but that night, I surely,

01:41:44.107 --> 01:41:45.272
prayed to God.

01:41:45.274 --> 01:41:49.913
I talked to God and I asked
him to send me an answer.

01:41:50.981 --> 01:41:53.449
If my decision was the right
one,

01:41:55.085 --> 01:41:56.552
then send me a sign.

01:41:59.755 --> 01:42:00.991
And the next day,

01:42:02.092 --> 01:42:04.928
this young woman showed up in my
room!

01:42:08.999 --> 01:42:12.834
Now, I didn't have much
information

01:42:12.836 --> 01:42:14.905
about this hearing today,

01:42:17.506 --> 01:42:21.878
but I knew if I had the
possibility of making a difference,

01:42:30.954 --> 01:42:32.823
I needed to be here.

01:42:38.794 --> 01:42:39.795
Your Honor.

01:42:42.098 --> 01:42:43.465
Alaska Rose,

01:42:44.767 --> 01:42:45.869
saved my life.

01:42:47.838 --> 01:42:51.473
Now, if that doesn't count for
something,

01:42:53.009 --> 01:42:54.010
what else does?

01:43:02.551 --> 01:43:04.054
Thank you, Miss Foster.

01:43:04.888 --> 01:43:07.723
I appreciate your testimony, I
truly do.

01:43:08.657 --> 01:43:10.959
Now, if you'll have a seat,

01:43:10.961 --> 01:43:12.828
I would ask Miss Rose to step
forward.

01:43:14.965 --> 01:43:19.600
Miss Rose the purpose of your
community service at Sunnyvale

01:43:19.602 --> 01:43:21.602
was to bring you to an
understanding

01:43:21.604 --> 01:43:24.072
of the seriousness of your
actions,

01:43:24.074 --> 01:43:29.143
and an awareness of those
other than yourself.

01:43:29.145 --> 01:43:32.579
Unfortunately,
this last incident with the boy complicates

01:43:32.581 --> 01:43:36.583
matters and will have to be
handled in a separate hearing.

01:43:36.585 --> 01:43:40.587
However, based on direct
feedback,

01:43:40.589 --> 01:43:43.057
I am convinced that the original
goal,

01:43:43.059 --> 01:43:45.927
associated with your impending
sentence,

01:43:45.929 --> 01:43:49.832
has been fulfilled and I
am dismissing the charges.

01:43:51.067 --> 01:43:52.233
So ordered.

01:44:26.102 --> 01:44:27.836
Is everything okay?

01:44:29.172 --> 01:44:29.973
Officer?

01:44:31.274 --> 01:44:32.808
Have a seat, Mr. Austin.

01:44:34.110 --> 01:44:35.209
But, I had...

01:44:35.211 --> 01:44:36.212
Sit down.

01:44:49.993 --> 01:44:51.125
What's this?

01:44:51.127 --> 01:44:55.096
Oh, that's for your statement,
for what really happened

01:44:55.098 --> 01:44:57.033
between you and Alaska Rose that
night.

01:44:58.168 --> 01:44:59.601
I already gave a statement.

01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:01.470
So did he.

01:45:05.141 --> 01:45:07.609
And so did Amy James.

01:45:08.378 --> 01:45:10.146
These are the additional
statements.

01:45:11.914 --> 01:45:13.582
This story's becoming real
clear.

01:45:17.187 --> 01:45:18.188
Now it's your turn.

01:45:21.724 --> 01:45:24.225
If you don't wanna do
what's right for Alaska,

01:45:24.227 --> 01:45:25.928
then do what's right for
yourself.

01:45:27.097 --> 01:45:31.134
Filing a false statement is
a serious crime, Mr. Austin.

01:45:33.802 --> 01:45:36.072
Your friends are smart
enough to figure that out.

01:47:52.908 --> 01:47:56.279
Dear Heavenly Father, we ask a
blessing.

01:47:57.447 --> 01:47:58.981
Thank you for this food,

01:48:00.048 --> 01:48:01.317
and for my friends,

01:48:01.950 --> 01:48:04.252
and for the freedom we have
today,

01:48:04.254 --> 01:48:06.722
because of all of those
who've sacrificed for us.

01:48:07.423 --> 01:48:11.292
We are especially grateful
for the sacrifice of your son,

01:48:11.294 --> 01:48:14.262
and for the atonement
he made for all of us.

01:48:14.264 --> 01:48:16.897
Please help us to be
more like him every day,

01:48:16.899 --> 01:48:18.301
and please forgive me...

01:48:23.439 --> 01:48:27.375
Please forgive us, of our sins,

01:48:27.377 --> 01:48:30.946
and accept our love and
gratitude, today and every day.

01:48:32.915 --> 01:48:35.416
Thank you for bringing
us all together tonight,

01:48:35.418 --> 01:48:36.985
and thank you for my family.

01:48:39.389 --> 01:48:42.891
I say this in the name of our
savior, Jesus Christ, Amen.
