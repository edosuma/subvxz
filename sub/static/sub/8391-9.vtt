00:03.030 --> 00:06.204
ALEX IS THE VOLUNTEER
COORDINATOR HERE.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.299
- I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

00:08.350 --> 00:12.275
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS JUST
AREN'T GOOD FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.595
- IT WAS A WOMAN...
UP NORTH.

00:14.630 --> 00:15.904
- MOM.

00:15.940 --> 00:17.908
- I KNOW THAT YOU
CHEATED ON MOM.

00:17.940 --> 00:19.453
HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO HER?

00:19.500 --> 00:21.286
- WE DID IT
TO EACH OTHER, ADAM.

00:21.330 --> 00:23.491

HE'S AMAZING.

00:23.540 --> 00:25.292

I KNOW HER PASSWORD?

00:33.550 --> 00:34.642
- DIDN'T YOU
OVERHEAR IT ONCE?

00:34.680 --> 00:36.887
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW EVERYTHING WE DO IS WRONG.

00:36.930 --> 00:38.261
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

00:38.310 --> 00:39.789
- I'M OFFICIALLY
NOT A PART OF THIS.

00:39.830 --> 00:41.309
- THEY WERE TRYING TO GET ME

00:41.350 --> 00:42.920
TO LOOK UP
YOUR S.A.T. SCORE.

00:42.970 --> 00:44.312
- WHAT?

00:44.350 --> 00:45.271
- NO, I'M NOT A NARC.

00:45.320 --> 00:48.175

YOU GOT ANYTHING?

00:56.050 --> 00:57.563

00:57.600 --> 01:00.114
ALL RIGHT, BUT WE HAVE TO ADD
THESE, THOUGH.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.604
- THEY DON'T ADD IT
FOR YOU?

01:01.640 --> 01:02.880
OKAY, SOMEBODY ADD,
SOMEBODY ADD.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.569

A CALCULATOR OR...?

01:04.610 --> 01:07.670

01:18.250 --> 01:20.969
- 2400 IS
A PERFECT SCORE, SO...

01:21.010 --> 01:22.898
- HANG ON. WAIT.
- UNBELIEVABLE.

01:22.940 --> 01:23.975
- IT MIGHT BE A MISTAKE.

01:24.010 --> 01:25.591
- SHE APPARENTLY
IS A GENIUS.

01:25.630 --> 01:27.279
- OH, MY GOD! NO!

01:27.320 --> 01:29.948
- ALL RIGHT! YEAH!

01:42.860 --> 01:45.067
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

02:14.060 --> 02:15.334
SHE DIDN'T INVITE ME.

02:15.370 --> 02:16.951
- YOU'RE NOT INVITED?

02:16.990 --> 02:18.127
YOU GUYS ARE BUDDIES, THOUGH.

02:18.170 --> 02:19.432
YOU PLAY

02:30.770 --> 02:34.285
[cleaner spraying]

02:34.320 --> 02:36.379
- I THINK MAYBE
THAT THE LESSON HERE IS

02:36.430 --> 02:38.000
THAT IF YOU'RE PLAYING TENNIS
WITH STEVE JOBS,

02:38.050 --> 02:39.392
YOU LET HIM WIN.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.159

THE BRAGGING RIGHTS? NO.

02:41.190 --> 02:42.566

03:01.830 --> 03:03.582

I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.

03:03.630 --> 03:05.382
YOU DIDN'T BEAT ME.
I BEAT YOU.

03:05.420 --> 03:07.388

03:25.370 --> 03:27.998

OF GORDON'S FROM COLLEGE.

03:28.030 --> 03:29.827

03:51.990 --> 03:53.116
IT WAS, UM...

03:53.160 --> 03:56.266
REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.360
BUT, UM, THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

03:59.410 --> 04:00.502
- [exhales sharply]

04:00.550 --> 04:02.575
- THE TEACHER WHO WAS SCHEDULED
TO TEACH THIS COURSE

04:02.620 --> 04:04.850
HAD A CONFLICT
AND IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE

04:04.890 --> 04:06.710
TO BE THERE
FOR THE FIRST FEW SESSIONS,

04:06.760 --> 04:10.344
AND THE SUBSTITUTE TEACHER

04:10.380 --> 04:13.315
MA'I'I'H EW BOSCALLI.

04:13.350 --> 04:14.248

TO BE OPEN ABOUT IT.

04:17.910 --> 04:20.424
OF COURSE,
THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.

04:20.460 --> 04:23.111
IT'S ALL VERY PROFESSIONAL.
- OKAY.

04:23.150 --> 04:24.902
PROFESSIONAL, HUH?

04:24.950 --> 04:28.704
- LOOK, ZEEK, I NEED

04:28.750 --> 04:31.389
IT'S THE ONLY TIME ALL YEAR
THEY'RE OFFERING FIGURE STUDIES.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.091
THIS IS LIFE DRAWING,
YOU KNOW, WITH LIVE MODELS.

04:34.130 --> 04:35.540
IT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN
STRUGGLING WITH.

04:35.580 --> 04:38.162
SO I JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO HIDE ANYTHING,

04:38.200 --> 04:39.303
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

04:39.340 --> 04:40.329
I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT EITHER.

04:40.380 --> 04:45.306
SO, UM, I WANT
TO TAKE THE CLASS, AND, UM...

04:45.350 --> 04:48.035

05:04.300 --> 05:06.609
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

05:06.650 --> 05:09.198
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

05:09.230 --> 05:11.619
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

05:11.650 --> 05:13.470
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

05:13.520 --> 05:15.920
AND MAY YOU STAY

05:15.970 --> 05:18.655
FOREVER YOUNG

05:18.690 --> 05:21.318
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

05:21.350 --> 05:23.557
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

05:23.590 --> 05:25.899
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

05:25.940 --> 05:28.283
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

05:28.320 --> 05:31.073
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

05:31.120 --> 05:33.259
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

05:33.290 --> 05:35.110

05:35.160 --> 05:38.129
FOREVER YOUNG

05:38.160 --> 05:40.151

05:40.200 --> 05:42.839
FOREVER YOUNG

05:44.960 --> 05:46.234
- EUREKA!

05:46.270 --> 05:48.511
- THERE'S GOLD IN THESE HILLS.

05:48.550 --> 05:51.064
- WHOA!
DID YOU GUYS SEE THAT?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.829
THAT WAS INTENSE.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.205
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, JUST
A COUPLE OF TECHNICAL THINGS.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.649
WE ONLY HAVE A FEW WEEKS...

05:57.700 --> 06:00.146
- HEY, PRINCIPAL TAYLOR.
- THOUGHTS?

06:00.180 --> 06:02.000
- OH, I'M JUST WATCHING.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.142
- TALK TO YOUR PARENTS.

06:03.190 --> 06:05.499
HAVE THEM PRETEND TO BE
THE OTHER CHARACTERS, OKAY?

06:05.530 --> 06:09.318
- I THINK THIS ONE'S SHAPING UP
TO BE A REAL STINKER.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.429
- RIGHT, YOU DO?
- YEAH!

06:10.470 --> 06:11.607
- I HAVE NOTHING
AGAINST JOEL,

06:11.640 --> 06:13.255
BUT HE DIRECTED
THE PLAY LAST YEAR--

06:13.300 --> 06:16.337
THE LONGEST 47 MINUTES
OF MY LIFE.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.019
- [laughs]

06:18.060 --> 06:19.231
- HERE'S A THOUGHT.

06:19.270 --> 06:22.262
YOU'RE A CREATIVE GUY.
YOU'RE FUNNY.

06:22.310 --> 06:24.028
WANT TO HELP OUT?

06:24.070 --> 06:26.209
- UH, WITH THE PLAY?

06:26.240 --> 06:27.207
YEAH, I...

06:27.240 --> 06:29.481
- HEY, WHAT
DO YOU GUYS THINK?

06:31.280 --> 06:33.384
YEAH? YEAH, IT'S
A LITTLE ROUGH. RIGHT.

06:33.420 --> 06:36.218
- JOEL, I'VE JUST
BEEN TALKING TO CROSBY,

06:36.250 --> 06:38.810
AND HE IS EAGER
TO GET INVOLVED

06:38.840 --> 06:41.149
WITH OUR PARENT COMMUNITY
HERE AT SYCAMORE...

06:41.190 --> 06:42.179
- IS HE?

06:42.220 --> 06:44.017
- AND, UM, PITCH IN.

06:44.050 --> 06:46.530
- THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
I BELIEVE IN HIM.

06:46.570 --> 06:50.199
- WHAT IF CROSBY BECAME
YOUR ASSISTANT DIRECTOR?

06:50.230 --> 06:51.879
- THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.330
- YOU KNOW,
I HAVE BEEN DYING

06:53.370 --> 06:56.442
TO BE YOUR ASSISTANT
SINCE WE MET, SO...

06:56.480 --> 06:57.686
- PERFECT.
OKAY, COOL.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.301
SO, UH, WE'LL TALK
ABOUT SCHEDULING

06:59.340 --> 07:01.729
AND ALL THAT JUNK--
AWESOME.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.988
I'M GONNA GET BACK TO IT.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.064
ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

07:04.110 --> 07:06.317
- OKAY.

07:06.350 --> 07:08.033
- HOW ABOUT...?

07:08.080 --> 07:11.004
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU, KID.
SPICE IT UP.

07:11.050 --> 07:12.278
- EUREKA!

07:12.320 --> 07:15.255
- THERE'S GOLDEN
IN THESE HILLS.

07:15.290 --> 07:16.848
- CLOSE ENOUGH, ALL RIGHT?

07:26.720 --> 07:28.927
- YOU HAVE WAY TOO MUCH TIME
ON YOUR HANDS.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.133
- EXCUSE ME.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:31.170 --> 07:32.239
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

07:32.270 --> 07:33.680
- I'M JUST SAYING,
ALL THE LABELS

07:33.720 --> 07:35.369
DON'T HAVE TO BE FACING
THE EXACT SAME WAY.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.274
- YEAH, BUT IT'S CONVENIENT
IF THEY ARE.

07:37.310 --> 07:40.108
YOU CAN TELL THAT
IT'S MEXICAN STEWED TOMATOES.

07:40.140 --> 07:41.937
- WHEN EVER YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT O.C.D.,

07:41.970 --> 07:43.528
LET ME KNOW--
I'M HERE FOR YOU, OKAY?

07:43.560 --> 07:45.073
OKAY.

07:45.110 --> 07:47.283
UM...

07:47.320 --> 07:50.699
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS WEEK?

07:50.740 --> 07:52.776
- THIS WEEK, ACTUALLY,
I'M GOING TO THE LIBRARY.

07:52.810 --> 07:56.257
I HAVE A HOT DATE WITH THIS GUY
FROM ROMANIA.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.881
WE PLAY SCRABBLE. ..

07:57.920 --> 07:59.023
ON LINE?

07:59.060 --> 08:01.437
- DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M THE WEIRD ONE.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.674
THAT IS WEIRD.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.779
- WHAT ABOUT YOU--
ANY BIG PLANS?

08:04.820 --> 08:07.584
- ACTUALLY, THIS WEIRD,
WEIRD GUY AT MY SCHOOL,

08:07.620 --> 08:09.611
EVERYBODY'S GONNA GO
TO HIS HOUSE FOR A PARTY.

08:09.660 --> 08:11.719
HE MADE A MOVIE
ON HIS CELL PHONE OR SOMETHING,

08:11.760 --> 08:14.797
AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD,
BUT IT MIGHT BE...

08:14.830 --> 08:17.003
- IT SOUNDS VERY TEMPTING
AND ENTERTAINING,

08:17.040 --> 08:19.213
BUT I THINK
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DECLINE.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.075
BUT THANK YOU.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.428
- NO, YEAH. ANYTIME.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.428
- WELL, GET
BACK TO--TO WORK.

08:25.470 --> 08:26.698
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:26.740 --> 08:28.219
- JUST GIVING YOU
SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.

08:28.260 --> 08:31.297
- YOU'RE JUST, LIKE, TRYING
TO BE ANNOYING.

08:31.330 --> 08:33.298
- UH-HUH.

08:37.790 --> 08:40.236
- PEOPLE LISTEN
IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.239
YOUR FACE
DOESN'T ALWAYS READ

08:43.280 --> 08:45.373
THE WAY YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.

08:45.420 --> 08:48.105
THAT'S
WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

08:48.140 --> 08:49.767
TO HAVE VERBAL CUES.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.483
- CAN I...?
- THINK OF IT THIS WAY--

08:51.530 --> 08:54.693
- CAN I SAY SOMETHING HERE?
- SURE.

08:55.770 --> 08:58.523
- I MESSED AROUND.

09:00.470 --> 09:02.984
I HAD AN AFFAIR.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.009
BUT SHE DID TOO.

09:04.060 --> 09:07.188
SHE SLEPT
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

09:07.230 --> 09:09.710
AND NOW SHE WANTS
TO TAKE AN ART CLASS

09:09.750 --> 09:13.049
FROM THE GUY THAT SHE SLEPT
WITH--SAME GUY.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.852
SO, I DON'T KNOW,

09:14.890 --> 09:18.371
WHY DON'T WE
TALK ABOUT THAT?

09:18.410 --> 09:21.038
- I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE CLASS.

09:21.070 --> 09:22.799
I WAS OPEN ABOUT IT.

09:22.830 --> 09:26.072
I DIDN'T TRY
TO HIDE ANYTHING.

09:28.910 --> 09:30.901
- I WANT YOU
TO DROP IT.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.847
- OKAY, ZEEK,
CAN YOU TELL HER WHY?

09:36.400 --> 09:37.708
- WHY WHAT?

09:37.740 --> 09:42.086
- UH, TELL HER
HOW IT MAKES YOU FEEL.

09:49.410 --> 09:51.446
- [sighs]

09:51.480 --> 09:52.890
I'M HURT.

09:55.490 --> 09:59.517
I'M ANGRY.
I'M--I'M JEALOUS.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.939
- OKAY.
THAT'S A GOOD JOB.

10:06.190 --> 10:07.327
[sighs]

10:07.360 --> 10:10.841
CAMILLE, IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO ZEEK?

10:18.470 --> 10:21.883
- I UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU FEEL.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.448
I DO.

10:25.480 --> 10:29.689
AND I WILL THINK ABOUT IT.

10:35.980 --> 10:38.039
- I MEAN, MISS ORKAND
SPECIFICALLY SAID

10:38.080 --> 10:40.662
THAT MAX AND EMILY
GET ALONG, YOU KNOW.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.497
THEY'RE A PERFECT MATCH
FOR EACH OTHER.

10:42.530 --> 10:43.565
- I WAS THERE.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.603
- I MEAN, THEY SIT
AT THE SAME TABLE TOGETHER.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.847
THEY DO THEIR CLASS PROJECTS
TOGETHER.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.508
- YEP.
- THEY GET ALONG REALLY WELL.

10:51.540 --> 10:54.816
I JUST THINK IT'S WEIRD
THAT EMILY'S MOM

10:54.860 --> 10:59.138
WOULD SINGLE HIM OUT
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

10:59.170 --> 11:02.378
- MAYBE IT'S JUST AN OVERSIGHT
OR SOMETHING.

11:04.590 --> 11:07.104
- MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HER.
LET HER KNOW.

11:07.140 --> 11:10.667
- KRISTINA--
- YOU KNOW, MOM TO MOM.

11:10.700 --> 11:14.488
IT PROBABLY JUST GOT LOST
IN THE MAIL.

11:14.530 --> 11:16.498
- YEAH.

11:16.530 --> 11:17.974
IT HAPPENS.

11:18.020 --> 11:19.806
- YEAH.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.508
- HONEY?
- YEAH?

11:32.550 --> 11:34.996
- CAN I COME IN AND TELL YOU
HOW PROUD I AM OF YOU?

11:35.030 --> 11:37.544
- I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T.
- OKAY, THANKS.

11:37.590 --> 11:39.990
- HERE YOU COME.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.928
- HONEY...

11:41.970 --> 11:43.904
CAN YOU JUST BE HAPPY
FOR YOURSELF?

11:43.940 --> 11:45.669
- I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.179
- COME ON!
LOOK AT YOU.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.244
THIS TIME LAST YEAR,

11:48.290 --> 11:49.905
WHO KNEW IF YOU WERE
EVEN GONNA TAKE THIS TEST,

11:49.950 --> 11:51.212
AND NOW YOU'VE DONE
SO WELL.

11:51.260 --> 11:52.978
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

11:53.020 --> 11:55.011
- LISTEN, SOMETHING HAPPENED
AT WORK TODAY.

11:55.050 --> 11:56.017
- [gaSPSJ
- A WOMAN CAME IN

11:56.060 --> 11:58.016
WHO WAS A CLASSMATE OF GORDON'S
AT BERKELEY,

11:58.060 --> 12:00.949
AND SHE'S STILL
A REALLY POWERFUL ALUM THERE.

12:00.990 --> 12:02.855
ALUM...NUS.
ALUM...NI.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.166
ANYWAY, I ASKED GORDON
IF SHE WOULD SIT DOWN WITH YOU,

12:06.200 --> 12:07.610
AND HE SAID YES.

12:07.650 --> 12:09.026
- BUT WHY?
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

12:09.070 --> 12:10.890
- BECAUSE IT'S A CONNECTION,

12:10.930 --> 12:13.103
AND--AND IF SHE LIKES YOU,
MAYBE SHE CAN MAKE A PHONE CALL

12:13.140 --> 12:14.892
OR, YOU KNOW, WRITE
A LETTER TO SOMEBODY.

12:14.940 --> 12:16.999
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT COULD BE REALLY HELPFUL,

12:17.040 --> 12:20.976
AND SO I THOUGHT
YOU'D SIT DOWN WITH HER.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.209
- I DON'T WANT TO.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.251
- IT'S SUCH
AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY.

12:26.290 --> 12:28.872
DON'T JUST SAY,
"I DON'T WANT TO DO IT."

12:28.920 --> 12:30.148
- I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.
- WHY?

12:30.190 --> 12:33.011
- I DON'T WANT TO PUT MYSELF
IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.709
- WHY IS IT UNCOMFORTABLE?
THIS IS ONE MEETING.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.126
DON'T SAY NO
TO EVERYTHING, OKAY?

12:36.160 --> 12:37.980
- I HAVE TO GO SIT THERE
AND PROVE MYSELF?

12:38.030 --> 12:40.021
THEN I DON'T WANT TO.
- IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.266
- THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

12:41.310 --> 12:43.028
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO IN THERE
AND TRY TO PROVE YOURSELF.

12:43.070 --> 12:45.231
- YOU ALWAYS SAY NO.
- I DON'T WANT TO.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.340
NO.

12:54.220 --> 12:55.903
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS UP HERE.

12:55.940 --> 12:58.181
PAY ATTENTION AND REALLY
JUST TRY AND GET

12:58.220 --> 13:00.563
THOSE LINES OUT,
OKAY, JABBAR?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.465
LET'S HEAR IT.
- EUREKA!

13:02.500 --> 13:06.152
- THERE'S GOLDEN
IN THOSE HILLS.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.509
- OKAY, THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

13:07.540 --> 13:11.294
AND, SIENNA, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT NOW?

13:12.860 --> 13:15.818
- SHE SAYS,
"DOES THIS LOOK LIKE GOLD?"

13:15.860 --> 13:17.475
- I DON'T LIKE THAT LINE.

13:17.520 --> 13:20.409
- YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT LINE?

13:20.450 --> 13:23.135
JOEL, I MEAN,
EVEN SHE KNOWS IT'S A BAD LINE.

13:23.180 --> 13:24.579
- HEY, TAKE FIVE.
LET'S TAKE TEN.

13:24.630 --> 13:25.517
WAIT.
[kids laughing]

13:25.560 --> 13:27.790
- THIS IS--
THIS IS PRETTY SLOW GOING.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.660
IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE GETTING THERE.

13:29.700 --> 13:30.837
- YEAH, IT'S EARLY.

13:30.870 --> 13:32.212
- THEY SHOULDN'T MEMORIZE
THESE LINES.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.456
THEY'RE BORING.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.899
- THEY GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

13:34.950 --> 13:37.157
- YOU KNOW, WHAT
IF I WROTE SOMETHING,

13:37.190 --> 13:39.943
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING MUSICAL...
LIKE A BROADWAY?

13:39.990 --> 13:41.184
- YEAH, YOU THINK THAT'S--

13:41.230 --> 13:42.743
- HEY!
DO YOU GUYS LIKE MUSIC?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.839
all: YEAH!

13:44.890 --> 13:45.959
- NO...
- SEE HOW EXCITED THEY ARE?

13:45.990 --> 13:47.924
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THAT EXCITED
SINCE WE STARTED.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.928
- YEAH, CROSBY, IT'S JUST--

13:49.960 --> 13:52.929
I'D LOVE THEM TO JUST MEMORIZE
THESE LINES FIRST,

13:52.970 --> 13:54.892
AND THEN WE CAN THINK
ABOUT ADDING SOMETHING ELSE.

13:54.930 --> 13:56.409
- OKAY, BUT DO YOU LIKE
THE MUSIC IDEA?

13:56.450 --> 13:57.792
- I--YEAH, I THINK
IT'S A GREAT IDEA,

13:57.830 --> 14:00.071
JUST TIME PERMITTING.

14:00.110 --> 14:02.487
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE THE BOSS.

14:02.530 --> 14:03.554
- OKAY.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.046
- DID YOU SEE THAT EXPLOSION
OF ENTHUSIASM?

14:06.080 --> 14:07.149
- YES, I SAW IT.
NOTED.

14:07.190 --> 14:08.634
- YOU GUYS LIKE MUSIC?

14:08.670 --> 14:12.254
all: YEAH!

14:12.290 --> 14:16.249
[bell rings]
- THANK YOU.

14:16.300 --> 14:18.188
- OH, HI.

14:18.230 --> 14:19.606
ANDIE?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.333
- YES.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

14:21.370 --> 14:24.680
I'M--I'M MAX'S MOM.
I WAS JUST IN THE CLASSROOM.

14:24.720 --> 14:25.618
- YEAH, KRISTINA, HI.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.379
- HI. WE MET
AT "BACK TO SCHOOL" NIGHT.

14:27.410 --> 14:28.342
- OF COURSE, SORRY.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.109
- YOU KNOW,
MAX DIDN'T GET AN INVITE

14:30.140 --> 14:31.232
TO EMILY'S BIRTHDAY PARTY,

14:31.280 --> 14:34.101
SO I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF, BY CHANCE, IT WAS LOST,

14:34.140 --> 14:36.654
OR MAYBE
IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT?

14:36.700 --> 14:38.691
- OH.

14:38.730 --> 14:40.174
NO.

14:41.950 --> 14:43.110
- NO?

14:45.160 --> 14:47.151
OH, NO.

14:49.020 --> 14:51.363
IT WASN'T. OH, GOSH.
UM, OKAY.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.571
I GUESS I JUST
DON'T UNDERSTAND,

14:52.610 --> 14:55.056
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
IN THE SAME CLASS TOGETHER,

14:55.100 --> 14:57.261
AND THEY SORT OF HAVE THE SAME
CHALLENGES AND STRUGGLES,

14:57.310 --> 14:59.995
AND I...I FEEL
LIKE IT'S A LITTLE CRUEL

15:00.030 --> 15:02.658
FOR MAX TO BE SINGLED OUT
LIKE THAT.

15:02.690 --> 15:05.727
- UH, WELL,
IT WASN'T JUST MAX.

15:05.760 --> 15:08.035
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE
TWO OTHER KIDS IN THE CLASS.

15:08.070 --> 15:11.073
EMILY SPECIFICALLY TOLD US

15:11.110 --> 15:12.975
SHE DOESN'T WANT THEM
AT HER BIRTHDAY.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.523
WE DIDN'T MEAN
FOR IT TO BE CRUEL.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.767
- WELL, IT IS CRUEL.
IT'S A LITTLE CRUEL.

15:16.810 --> 15:18.038
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
THE SCHOOL SAYS

15:18.080 --> 15:19.968
THAT IF ONE KID IS INVITED
TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY

15:20.020 --> 15:21.157
THAT EVERYBODY
SHOULD BE INVITED.

15:21.190 --> 15:23.055
- THE HANDBOOK
ACTUALLY STATES

15:23.090 --> 15:25.149
THAT IF YOU DON'T PASS OUT
INVITATIONS IN CLASS,

15:25.200 --> 15:27.293
THEN NOT EVERYONE
HAS TO BE INCLUDED.

15:27.340 --> 15:28.409
- THE HANDBOOK DOES SAY THAT,
BUT, I MEAN,

15:28.440 --> 15:30.476
THE SPIRIT OF THIS SCHOOL
IS INCLUSION, YOU KNOW,

15:30.510 --> 15:33.126
AND THAT'S BASICALLY
ALL THEY EVER TALK ABOUT.

15:33.170 --> 15:34.501
- LOOK, MY HUSBAND AND I
TALKED ABOUT IT.

15:34.550 --> 15:38.134
WE BOTH FEEL THAT
ONE DAY OUT OF THE YEAR,

15:38.170 --> 15:41.207
ONE SINGLE DAY,
EMILY DESERVES TO HAVE

15:41.250 --> 15:43.480
EXACTLY THE KIND OF PARTY
THAT SHE WANTS.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.149
SHE WORKS...

15:47.180 --> 15:49.455
SHE WORKS VERY HARD
TO LEARN THINGS

15:49.500 --> 15:51.149
THAT COME EASY
FOR ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE,

15:51.190 --> 15:52.805
SO I JUST
WANT TO LISTEN TO HER.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.216
[tearfully]
AND I'M SORRY,

15:54.260 --> 15:55.909
BUT AS A MOTHER
OF AN ASPY KID,

15:55.950 --> 15:57.736
I WOULD HOPE
YOU CAN JUST UNDERSTAND THAT.

15:57.780 --> 15:59.566
- I DO, YEAH.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.362
[footsteps departing]

16:23.560 --> 16:25.596
- HOWDY, PARTNER.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.185
- HI.

16:29.220 --> 16:33.498
- ALL RIGHT,
I GOT A QUESTION.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.815
ARE YOU GONNA BE LEAVING
THAT CLASS

16:35.850 --> 16:38.057
TAUGHT BY YOUR FLING
OR WHAT?

16:39.750 --> 16:41.786
[tOOls clang]

16:44.690 --> 16:48.547
- I'M NOT GOING TO DIGNIFY THAT
WITH AN ANSWER.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.627
- OKAY, WE GOT OFF
TO A BAD START THERE.

16:51.660 --> 16:54.527
HOW ABOUT, ARE YOU GONNA
DROP THE CLASS?

17:03.600 --> 17:05.329
- DO YOU TRUST ME?

17:11.400 --> 17:12.401
- YEAH.

17:13.790 --> 17:15.883
YEAH, I DO.

17:15.930 --> 17:18.854
- GOOD...

17:18.890 --> 17:22.417
BECAUSE THIS
IS ABOUT TRUST.

17:22.450 --> 17:25.726
WE HAVE TO START TRUSTING
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

17:25.760 --> 17:30.242
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
BETWEEN ME AND MATTHEW,

17:30.290 --> 17:33.111
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

17:33.150 --> 17:36.904
AND, NO, I DON'T WANT TO DROP
THE CLASS.

17:36.950 --> 17:40.499
YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO...

17:40.540 --> 17:43.088
GET PAST.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.530
WE BOTH DO.

17:50.030 --> 17:52.237
- YEAH. GOT IT.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.559
[screen door squeaking]

18:03.590 --> 18:06.241
[phone rings]

18:06.290 --> 18:08.690
- COMMUNITY CENTER.

18:08.740 --> 18:11.732
- UH, HEY,
IS THIS ALEX?

18:11.780 --> 18:14.567
- YEAH. HI. HADDIE?

18:14.610 --> 18:16.180
[music, loud conversation]
- YEAH.

18:16.230 --> 18:18.221
OH, YOU RECOGNIZED MY VOICE.
UM, I'M JUST...

18:18.260 --> 18:21.741
ACTUALLY, I'M AT
THAT WEIRD GUY'S PARTY,

18:21.790 --> 18:23.439
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING,

18:23.480 --> 18:25.368
UM, DID I...

18:25.410 --> 18:27.878
DID I PUT DOWN THAT I'M GONNA
COME INTO WORK TOMORROW?

18:27.930 --> 18:29.545
I JUST WANTED TO BE,
UH, SURE

18:29.590 --> 18:31.160
AND THAT THERE WAS
NO CONFUSION.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.963
- YEAH. LET ME, UH--LET ME CHECK
REAL QUICK. HOLD ON.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.888
- OKAY.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.659
- YEP, I GOT YOU DOWN.
- OH, OKAY.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.659
UM, GREAT, THEN I'LL
JUST, UH, BE THERE.

18:42.700 --> 18:43.940
- YOU'RE LUCKY TOO.

18:43.980 --> 18:45.390
I HAVE A HUGE COMPOST PILE
OUT BACK

18:45.430 --> 18:46.738
WITH YOUR NAME
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.429
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LIKE TO GET DIRTY.

18:48.470 --> 18:50.426
- WELL, THANK YOU.
- I MEAN, DIRT.

18:50.470 --> 18:51.812
- YOU'RE EXAGGERATING
A LITTLE BIT.

18:51.850 --> 18:53.078
- LITTLE BIT.
- YEAH.

18:53.130 --> 18:56.258
- UM, ALL RIGHT, UH...

18:56.300 --> 18:58.188
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW, THEN.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.882
- OKAY, BYE.
- BYE.

19:06.620 --> 19:09.248
[pounding at door]

19:09.280 --> 19:10.247
- IS BEDOUIN REAL
OR A STAR WARSTHING?

19:10.280 --> 19:11.895
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.419
- IT WAS A STUPID PARTY.
I WISH I HADN'T GONE.

19:13.460 --> 19:14.836
- I'M SORRY THE PARTY
WAS STUPID,

19:14.870 --> 19:17.077
BUT I'M NOT SORRY
YOU HAD FUN WITH YOUR COUSIN.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.280
- ME TOO.
BUT DO YOU WANT TEA?

19:18.320 --> 19:19.833
- UM, SURE.

19:19.880 --> 19:20.869
HEY!

19:20.910 --> 19:21.877
- HEY.
- HI.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.662
- HEY, AMBER.
- HEY, DO YOU WANT SOME TEA?

19:23.710 --> 19:26.019
- UH, YEAH, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

19:26.060 --> 19:27.129
THANKS, AMBER.
- OKAY.

19:27.160 --> 19:31.221
- UM, SO I'LL GO GET
THAT, UH, BOOK.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.545
- ALL RIGHT.

19:33.580 --> 19:35.616
- I HOPE
POMEGRANATE IS OKAY.

19:35.650 --> 19:37.265
IT'S ALL WE'VE GOT
APPARENTLY.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.584
- SO YOUR MOM TELLS ME

19:38.620 --> 19:42.033
THAT YOUR S.A.T. SCORES
WERE OFF THE CHARTS.

19:42.070 --> 19:43.799
- YEAH.
- THAT'S GREAT.

19:43.830 --> 19:45.627
- THANK YOU.
- YEAH...

19:45.660 --> 19:47.036
A REGULAR PRODIGY.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.731
- MM-HMM.
- YEAH.

19:49.770 --> 19:51.317
AND, UH--
AND SHE ALSO MENTIONED

19:51.360 --> 19:52.349
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK

19:52.390 --> 19:54.563
TO MY FRIEND CARLY BAROW
WHO WENT TO BERKELEY.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.737
- THERE IT IS.
- THERE'S WHAT?

19:55.780 --> 19:57.532
- LOOK AT YOU BRINGING
IT UP SO CASUALLY.

19:57.570 --> 19:58.912
- WHAT?
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

19:58.950 --> 20:00.224
THIS IS A SETUP.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.466
- IT'S NOT A SETUP.
- I'M BEING AMBUSHED.

20:01.510 --> 20:02.841
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
- YES.

20:02.890 --> 20:04.744
COME ON, LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE GETTING ALL NERVOUS.

20:04.780 --> 20:06.122
THIS WAS ORCHESTRATED
BY MY MOTHER.

20:06.170 --> 20:07.296
- NO, NO, NO,
THIS WAS NOT ORCHESTRATED.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.262
- OKAY, THAT'S GREAT,
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT

20:09.310 --> 20:10.334
THAT I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE THIS MEETING.

20:10.380 --> 20:11.756
- THIS ISN'T A BIG DEAL
TO YOU?

20:11.790 --> 20:14.270
- NO, IT'S
NOT A BIG DEAL, OKAY?

20:14.310 --> 20:15.686
- OKAY, SINCE
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,

20:15.730 --> 20:16.992
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO TALK TO THIS WOMAN?

20:17.040 --> 20:19.588
- IF IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, WHY
DON'T I JUST NOT TALK TO HER?

20:19.630 --> 20:20.858
- OR IF IT'S
NOT A BIG DEAL,

20:20.900 --> 20:22.549
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SIT DOWN WITH A WOMAN

20:22.600 --> 20:24.318
WHO WENT TO BERKELEY,
LOVED IT,

20:24.360 --> 20:25.907
AND, YOU KNOW,
SO YOU HAVE A CONVERSATION.

20:25.940 --> 20:27.316
- [voice breaking]
I JUST DON'T WANT TO.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.568
I DON'T KNOW WHY
PEOPLE KEEP PUSHING ME TO DO IT.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.089
YOU DON'T GET IT.
- LISTEN...

20:36.130 --> 20:38.291
- EVERY TIME THERE'S, LIKE,
A BIG THING LIKE THIS,

20:38.340 --> 20:40.331
I ALWAYS MESS IT UP,
AND I'M SO TIRED OF MESSING UP.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.304
- AMBER...
- [sighs]

20:42.340 --> 20:43.853
- LIFE WILL KNOCK YOU DOWN

20:43.890 --> 20:47.303
MORE TIMES THAN YOU
CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

20:47.340 --> 20:51.481
DON'T KNOCK YOURSELF DOWN.

20:52.730 --> 20:54.129
DON'T AVOID
FEELING EMBARRASSED

20:54.180 --> 20:56.034
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
SOMETHING'S NOT GONNA GO WELL.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.832
- I'M NOT EMBARRASSED.
- SO WHAT IF IT DOESN'T GO WELL?

20:57.870 --> 20:59.144
SO WHAT?

20:59.180 --> 21:00.977
AMBER, YOU'RE...

21:01.010 --> 21:03.046
A WONDERFUL, TALENTED,

21:03.080 --> 21:06.288
AND REALLY SMART
YOUNG WOMAN...

21:06.330 --> 21:07.911
ALL RIGHT?

21:07.950 --> 21:09.872
PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.366
GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.711
- THE THING I RESENT
IS THAT YOUR BROTHER

21:22.760 --> 21:24.546
HAS NO IDEA
HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES

21:24.590 --> 21:26.558
TO PUT ANYTHING
WITH KIDS TOGETHER.

21:26.590 --> 21:28.763
HE'S JUST LIKE,
"HEY, LET'S SING SOME SONGS.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.721
IT'S NO BIG DEAL."

21:29.770 --> 21:30.691
- WELL, HE'S NEW
TO THE DYNAMIC WITH KIDS.

21:30.730 --> 21:31.719
- AND YOU KNOW
WHO'S GONNA CATCH THE HEAT

21:31.770 --> 21:34.216
WHEN THE KIDS DON'T KNOW
THEIR LINES? THIS GUY.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.832
- I'M SURE HE KNOWS
WHO'S THE BOSS.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.633
GONNA BE FINE.

21:39.670 --> 21:41.467
- I'M GONNA ROCK THIS PLAY.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.365
I MEAN, THIS MIGHT BE
THE FIRST ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL PLAY

21:43.400 --> 21:44.708
THAT WINS A TONY.

21:44.750 --> 21:47.127
- THAT'S SO COOL
THAT YOU'RE TAKING THIS ON.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.299
SO IS JOEL COOL WITH IT?

21:49.340 --> 21:52.503
- UH, WELL, THE DIRECTOR
IS A BIT DEFENSIVE,

21:52.550 --> 21:55.303
BUT I THINK
IT'S GONNA MAKE US CLOSER.

21:55.340 --> 21:58.093
OH, HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY BOX OF HARMONICAS.

21:58.140 --> 21:59.368
- MAYBE IN THE FRONT CLOSET?

21:59.420 --> 22:00.933
- BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT TAKES A PLAY

22:00.970 --> 22:04.383
FROM KIND OF GOOD
TO, LIKE, BROADWAY GOOD?

22:04.420 --> 22:06.217
both: HARMONICAS!

22:06.250 --> 22:07.478
- DAD, LET'S GO TO SCHOOL.

22:07.530 --> 22:10.181
- UM, OKAY,
I'LL TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL.

22:10.220 --> 22:11.380
OH, WAIT,
ONE QUICK QUESTION.

22:11.430 --> 22:12.874
UM, WHO'S KICKING ASS
AT PARENTING

22:12.910 --> 22:14.389
SO THAT THEIR FIANCEE
CAN KICK ASS

22:14.430 --> 22:16.318
AS A VISITING ARTIST
AT BERKELEY?

22:16.360 --> 22:17.429
WHO IS THAT PERSON?
- THAT'S YOU.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.392
- OH, THAT'S ME!
- THAT'S YOU!

22:19.440 --> 22:20.361
[laughing]

22:20.400 --> 22:22.402
MWAH, MWAH, MWAH.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.169
HUG ON MOMMY.
- ALL RIGHT, UH...

22:24.200 --> 22:25.235
- HAVE A GOOD DAY
AT SCHOOL.

22:25.270 --> 22:26.885
- OKAY.
- WE ARE OFF.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.409
DANCE YOUR HEART OUT.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.372
GOT YOUR BACKPACK, SHOES ARE
TIED, HAIR LOOKS GREAT.

22:30.410 --> 22:31.342
- YEP, YEP.
- LET'S DO IT.

22:31.380 --> 22:33.348
- BYE.

22:33.380 --> 22:34.995
- PICK UP THE PACE!

22:35.040 --> 22:36.484
- YOU HAVE A HAT ON.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.897
- I ALWAYS HAVE A HAT ON.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.426
- HERE YOU GO, BABE.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.981
HI.

22:58.030 --> 23:00.476
EMILY, RIGHT?

23:00.510 --> 23:02.330
HERE YOU GO. I BROUGHT YOU
SOME MORE MARKERS.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.301
- THANKS.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.787
- I'M KRISTINA.
I'M MAX'S MOMMY.

23:06.830 --> 23:08.752
HI.

23:10.380 --> 23:12.382
SO I HEARD THAT YOU HAVE
A BIRTHDAY COMING UP.

23:12.420 --> 23:14.342
ARE YOU SO EXCITED?

23:14.390 --> 23:15.698
- I'M HAVING A PARTY.
- MM-HMM.

23:15.730 --> 23:19.518
- I DIDN'T INVITE MAX.

23:21.570 --> 23:23.356
HONEY, WAS HE...?

23:23.400 --> 23:25.459
WAS HE MEAN TO YOU?

23:25.500 --> 23:28.469
- HE WON'T LOSE.

23:28.510 --> 23:30.603
_ 1--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:30.650 --> 23:33.369
- EVERY TIME
WE PLAY A GAME,

23:33.410 --> 23:35.435
HE GETS REALLY MAD
WHEN HE LOSES,

23:35.480 --> 23:37.573
SAYS WE HAVE TO PLAY
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

23:37.620 --> 23:40.475
SOMETIMES
I DON'T WANT TO,

23:40.520 --> 23:43.489
THEN HE GETS MAD AGAIN.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.341
- YEAH, WHO LIKES THAT?
- I DON'T.

23:46.390 --> 23:48.415
SO HE CAN'T COME
TO MY PARTY,

23:48.460 --> 23:50.724
'CAUSE WE WERE GOING
TO PLAY GAMES.

23:52.940 --> 23:54.635
- HMM.

24:02.850 --> 24:04.078
- HI, I'M CARLY.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

24:04.130 --> 24:04.983
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

24:05.020 --> 24:06.123
- OH! OW!
- WHAT?

24:06.160 --> 24:08.219
- WHAT IS THAT?
- PLEASE, YOU'RE SO DRAMATIC.

24:08.270 --> 24:10.090
- THAT IS REALLY TOO--
- SHOWTIME.

24:10.130 --> 24:12.826
- I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST FUNNY
THAT YOU ACTUALLY SAID THAT.

24:12.860 --> 24:13.997
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
- I'M SORRY.

24:14.030 --> 24:15.440
- GORDON,
WHO SET THE MEETING UP.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.277
- RIGHT. I APPRECIATE IT.
HOW ARE YOU?

24:17.310 --> 24:18.299
- GOOD TO SEE YOU. OOH.

24:18.350 --> 24:19.965
- WHAT?
- FIRM.

24:20.010 --> 24:22.149
- WELL, YEAH, I MEAN,
IT'S JUST A NORMAL--

24:22.180 --> 24:23.249
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS.
OKAY.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.486
- WHY DON'T WE GO
INTO MY OFFICE?

24:24.530 --> 24:25.599
WE'LL TALK
TO CARLY THERE, PLEASE.

24:25.630 --> 24:28.007
- UH, BEFORE YOU GO, DO YOU HAVE
ANY TIPS FOR HER?

24:28.050 --> 24:30.701
MAYBE, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING
ABOUT CARLY SHE SHOULD KNOW?

24:30.740 --> 24:33.538
- UM, SHE LOVES
THE ROLLING STONES.

24:33.570 --> 24:34.673
- [gasps] SHE LOVES
THE ROLLING STONES.

24:34.710 --> 24:36.052
- I CAN'T USE THAT.
- YES, YOU CAN!

24:36.090 --> 24:37.569
- HOW CAN YOU USE THAT?
IT'S A COLLEGE INTERVIEW.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.009
- WORK THAT IN.
THERE YOU GO.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.335
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

24:41.370 --> 24:43.167
HERE WEGO.
- OH, NO, RIGHT.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.610
ALL RIGHT, HAVE FUN.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.641
- JUST A MINUTE, OKAY?
- BYE-BYE.

24:46.690 --> 24:49.329
- CARLY,
THIS IS MY FRIEND, AMBER,

24:49.380 --> 24:51.166
AND WE WERE HOPING...

24:55.730 --> 24:56.890
- HEY, DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

24:56.940 --> 24:58.248
KEEP MOVING.
ACT NORMAL, ACT NORMAL.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.690
- WOULD YOU JUST
TAKE IT EASY?

24:59.730 --> 25:01.869
- TELL ME WHY YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN GOING TO BERKELEY.

25:01.910 --> 25:03.457
- IT'S A GREAT SCHOOL.
- YEAH.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.183
- I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
AS WELL AS YOU DO,

25:05.220 --> 25:09.008
BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE,
YOU KNOW, VERY NICE.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.530
THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW,
I WOULD WANT TO GO.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.265
- IT IS, YEAH.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.392
YEAH.

25:14.440 --> 25:17.921
- [breathes deeply]

25:17.960 --> 25:19.336
THE ROLLING STONES
ARE SO GREAT.

25:19.370 --> 25:21.440
- OH, YOU LIKE THE STONES?
- YOU THINK SO TOO, RIGHT?

25:21.480 --> 25:23.129
- YEAH, I'M A HUGE FAN.
- WHO DOESN'T?

25:23.170 --> 25:26.139
- YEAH, THEY'RE AWESOME.

25:26.170 --> 25:29.890
- BY THE WAY, SORRY ABOUT
THIS WHOLE THING, YOU KNOW,

25:29.940 --> 25:32.079
MY MOM
ASKING YOU TO DO THIS,

25:32.110 --> 25:34.169
'CAUSE, I MEAN, I GUESS
YOU PROBABLY GET THAT A LOT,

25:34.220 --> 25:35.482
BEING SUCCESSFUL,

25:35.530 --> 25:37.111
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
WANTING YOUR HELP

25:37.150 --> 25:39.459
AND MAKING YOU,
YOU KNOW, MEET THEIR CHILDREN,

25:39.500 --> 25:40.876
AND, UH, IT'S JUST--

25:40.910 --> 25:42.468
- NO, IT'S FINE.
IT'S FINE.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.047
LISTEN, IF YOU NEVER ASK
FOR WHAT YOU WANT,

25:44.090 --> 25:47.150
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IF
THE ANSWER'S GONNA BE YES OR NO.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.532
GOT TO TAKE THE RISK.

25:49.580 --> 25:51.468
- YEAH. [chuckles]
THAT MAKES SENSE.

25:51.510 --> 25:53.262
- YEAH.

25:53.310 --> 25:55.642
- I-I'M JUST
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

25:55.690 --> 25:56.896
I'M SORRY.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.067
- IT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.159
- IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE,
'CAUSE I'M LIKE,

26:00.210 --> 26:01.791
"DO I JUST BE COMPLETELY MYSELF
AND, LIKE,

26:01.830 --> 26:04.139
"MAYBE SAY SOMETHING
THAT'S VERY STUPID,

26:04.180 --> 26:05.408
"WHICH I'VE PROBABLY
ALREADY DONE?

26:05.460 --> 26:09.351
"OR SHOULD I BE, LIKE, ACTING,
LIKE, VERY SMART AND MATURE,

26:09.390 --> 26:10.618
OR I--"YOU KNOW?
I DON'T KNOW.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.184
- YOU JUST GOT TO BE YOURSELF,
WHICH YOU'RE DOING ADORABLY,

26:13.220 --> 26:14.972
AND IT'S FINE.
- OKAY.

26:15.020 --> 26:16.351
- I BOMBED
MY FIRST COLLEGE INTERVIEW.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.424
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

26:17.470 --> 26:18.494
- WHAT HAPPENED?

26:18.540 --> 26:20.326
- WELL, I WAS AFRAID
TO SHOW THEM THAT I CARED,

26:20.370 --> 26:23.157
AND, UH, SO I ACTED
WAY ABOVE IT AND TOO COOL

26:23.200 --> 26:25.577
AND KIND OF OBNOXIOUS,
AND IT WAS A DISASTER.

26:25.610 --> 26:27.020
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

26:27.060 --> 26:28.573
- 'CAUSE THE INTERVIEWER
GOT UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

26:28.620 --> 26:30.064
AND I LOOKED
AT HIS LITTLE NOTEBOOK

26:30.100 --> 26:31.715
THAT HE'D BEEN SCRIBBLING IN
TO SEE WHAT HE WAS WRITING,

26:31.760 --> 26:34.160
AND HE HAD SIMPLY WRITTEN
IN ALL CAPS, "ANNOYING."

26:34.210 --> 26:37.418
- THAT'S, LIKE, THE WORST THING.
- I KNOW.

26:37.450 --> 26:38.553
I WAS, THOUGH.
I WAS ANNOYING.

26:38.590 --> 26:40.103
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- NOTHING.

26:40.150 --> 26:41.833
HE CAME BACK,
AND I CONTINUED ACTING COOL

26:41.870 --> 26:43.212
AND FINISHED
THE ANNOYING INTERVIEW.

26:43.250 --> 26:45.047
- YOU KEPT GOING?
YOU STUCK WITH IT?

26:45.080 --> 26:45.933
- I HAD TO.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.561
YEAH, WELL,
I HAD TO STAY.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.773
- THAT'S AMAZING.
THAT'S PRETTY EXTREME.

26:49.810 --> 26:52.017
COOL.
[laughs]

26:52.050 --> 26:54.109
WELL, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ANNOYING.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.503
I JUST DON'T SEE THAT.
- WELL, THANK YOU.

26:56.540 --> 26:58.189
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE ANNOYING EITHER.

26:58.230 --> 27:00.266
- LET'S WAIT TILL
THE END OF THE INTERVIEW.

27:00.300 --> 27:02.165
- [chuckles]

27:02.200 --> 27:05.545

27:45.450 --> 27:47.691

THAT TEACH ES

27:47.730 --> 27:49.698
THAT FINGER-PAINTING CLASS

27:49.730 --> 27:51.971

UH, FIGURE DRAWING.

27:52.010 --> 27:53.978
YES, FOR
THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS.

27:54.010 --> 27:56.422
I'M MATTHEW.

I'M ZEEK BRAVERMAN...

28:01.330 --> 28:05.050
CAMILLE'S HUSBAND.

28:11.310 --> 28:16.088
- I WANT YOU TO STAY AWAY
FROM MY WIFE, MATTHEW.

28:16.140 --> 28:17.687
YOU UNDERSTAND?

28:17.730 --> 28:20.790
- YES.
SURE, I GET IT.

28:20.830 --> 28:23.276
- ALL RIGHT.

28:29.810 --> 28:31.949
- ANDIE?
IS THAT YOU?

28:31.980 --> 28:33.800
OH, HEY.
HOW ARE YOU?

28:33.850 --> 28:35.397
I'M NOT--
I'M NOT STALKING YOU.

28:35.430 --> 28:36.909
I WAS HERE.
IT'S KRISTINA.

28:36.950 --> 28:38.633
HOW ARE YOU?
- HI.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.261
- GOOD?
- YEAH.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.120
- LISTEN, UM,
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

28:42.160 --> 28:42.956
- OKAY.

28:42.990 --> 28:44.366
- I WAS THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

28:44.410 --> 28:47.334
I-I KNOW THAT, UM, MAX AND EMILY
HAVE SOME ISSUES, OKAY?

28:47.380 --> 28:48.995
AND I KNOW THAT--
THAT THERE ARE THINGS

28:49.030 --> 28:51.544
THAT THEY NEED TO WORK OUT,
OBVIOUSLY.

28:51.590 --> 28:53.239
BUT I HAD A GREAT IDEA.

28:53.280 --> 28:57.558
WHAT IF YOU GUYS, YOU AND EMILY,
CAME OVER FOR A PLAYDATE

28:57.590 --> 28:58.511
WITH MAX AND I?

28:58.560 --> 29:00.448
AND THEY COULD, YOU KNOW,
LOG SOME HOURS

29:00.490 --> 29:02.105
AND SORT OF SEE
HOW IT GOES.

29:02.150 --> 29:04.596
I KNOW MAX HAS TO WORK ON
BEING A SORE LOSER

29:04.630 --> 29:05.801
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.569
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF YOU GUYS CAME OVER,

29:07.600 --> 29:08.737
WE SAW HOW IT WENT,

29:08.780 --> 29:10.327
AND MAX COULD MAYBE COME
TO THE PARTY.

29:10.360 --> 29:12.009
- OKAY, I AM GOING TO BE HONEST.
- YEAH.

29:12.060 --> 29:13.709
- I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GET
INTO THIS AGAIN.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.320
- I KNOW. I KNOW
THAT THIS IS SO AWKWARD.

29:15.370 --> 29:16.917
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
NOT GETTING THE FACT

29:16.960 --> 29:18.916
THAT I ACTUALLY SAID NO.
- I KNOW. I HEARD YOU SAY NO.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.234
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT

29:20.270 --> 29:21.476
I THINK WE NEED
TO HELP EACH OTHER.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.785
- I'M SO SICK OF THIS WHOLE
"IT TAKES A VILLAGE" THING.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.400
LOOK, I'M IN THIS COMMUNITY.
I SHOW UP.

29:25.450 --> 29:26.849
I AM HERE.
- YOU ARE, AND I KNOW THAT,

29:26.900 --> 29:28.060
AND I SEE THAT.

29:28.110 --> 29:29.657
YOU KNOW,
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE

29:29.690 --> 29:31.339
YOUR DAUGHTER'S
BIGGEST ADVOCATE,

29:31.390 --> 29:32.789
AS I AM FOR MY SON.

29:32.840 --> 29:36.412
OTHERWISE,
I WOULDN'T BE PUSHING THIS HARD.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.928
I MEAN, ANDIE,
HAVE YOU EVER DONE SOMETHING

29:38.980 --> 29:43.462
SO STUPID AND--AND ASININE
AND DESPERATE LIKE THIS,

29:43.500 --> 29:47.436
YOU KNOW, JUST WANTING
TO BE A CHAMPION FOR YOUR KID?

29:47.470 --> 29:50.815
IF YOU HAVEN'T,
THEN I'M REALLY EMBARRASSED,

29:50.850 --> 29:52.408
AND I WILL LEAVE
AND WALK AWAY,

29:52.440 --> 29:55.261
AND I WON'T ASK YOU AGAIN
IF MAX CAN COME TO THE PARTY.

29:55.310 --> 29:57.449
I PROMISE YOU.

30:00.380 --> 30:02.792
- I HAVE DONE
SOME CRAZY THINGS FOR EMILY.

30:02.830 --> 30:05.378
- SEE?
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

30:05.420 --> 30:07.797
I JUST THINK IT COULD BE
A WONDERFUL THING, YOU KNOW?

30:07.840 --> 30:09.239
I HAVE THIS AMAZING
BEHAVIORAL AIDE.

30:09.290 --> 30:12.043
SHE'LL SIT WITH THEM AND--
AND FACILITATE THE PLAYDATE

30:12.080 --> 30:14.731
AND HAVE A GREAT TIME,
AND YOU AND I--

30:14.770 --> 30:18.558
WE CAN TALK
OR HAVE SUSHI OR SOMETHING.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.296
I MEAN,
IT COULD BE REALLY FUN.

30:25.030 --> 30:27.954
- [sighs]
MATTHEW?

30:29.720 --> 30:33.338
MATTH EW?

30:33.380 --> 30:36.349
COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT I'M DOING
WRONG HERE WITH THE HAND?

30:36.380 --> 30:37.517
IT'S--I DON'T KNOW.

30:37.550 --> 30:40.519
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING
THAT RESEMBLES A HAND.

30:40.560 --> 30:43.836
- CAMILLE, I THINK IT'S BETTER
IF WE DON'T TALK.

30:43.870 --> 30:46.623
- ABOUT THE DRAWING?

30:46.670 --> 30:48.251
- NO, ABOUT ANYTHING.

30:48.290 --> 30:51.282
YOUR HUSBAND
WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

30:53.670 --> 30:55.422
- YOU TALKED TO ZEEK?

30:55.470 --> 30:56.869
WHEN?

30:56.920 --> 30:59.468
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE MIDDLE OF ANYTHING,

30:59.510 --> 31:00.772
SERIOUSLY.

31:00.820 --> 31:04.335
LET'S AGREE THAT YOU'LL WAIT
FOR THE FEEDBACK ON YOUR WORK

31:04.370 --> 31:07.612
UNTIL MARCIE
RETURNS TO CLASS, OKAY?

31:13.420 --> 31:15.866

TO SAY THANKS

32:10.270 --> 32:13.683
FOR SETTING UP THAT MEETING
WITH CARLY.

32:13.720 --> 32:14.857

32:14.890 --> 32:18.542
- THANK YOU
FOR MAKING THAT HAPPEN. I...

32:18.590 --> 32:20.683
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.869
- NO, IT'S...

32:22.900 --> 32:24.720
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

32:26.800 --> 32:30.076
I WORRY A LOT, YOU KNOW,
THAT ALL THE CHOICES I MADE

32:30.120 --> 32:33.760
HAVEN'T HELPED MY KIDS,
AND SO...

32:33.810 --> 32:36.631
I WANT THEM
TO HAVE POSSIBILITIES.

32:36.670 --> 32:38.228
I WANT...

32:38.260 --> 32:42.264
AMBER RIGHT NOW TO HAVE...

32:44.030 --> 32:45.509
WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

32:45.540 --> 32:48.953
- WELL, I-I THINK AMBER'S
A REALLY COOL KID.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.331

32:51.790 --> 32:53.781
'CAUSE YOU ARE
AN AWESOME MOM.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.233
- ANYWAY, IT'S "MOBSTER."
- REALLY?

33:22.270 --> 33:24.784
YOU CAN'T USE "MOBSTER,"
'CAUSE "RF" IS NOT A WORD.

33:24.830 --> 33:27.719
- OKAY.
- R-F IS A WORD?

33:27.760 --> 33:30.923
RF?

33:39.150 --> 33:41.664
- MM-MM. MM-MM.
- WHAT?

33:41.700 --> 33:42.769
- "BEGAZE" IS NOT A WORD.

33:42.810 --> 33:44.596
- ARE YOU JEALOUS OF MY WORD?
- I'M NOT JEALOUS.

33:44.640 --> 33:48.087
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS "BEGAZE."

33:48.120 --> 33:51.157
- LOOK AT ME
FOR A SECOND.

33:51.200 --> 33:52.952
SEE THAT,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

33:52.990 --> 33:55.572
YOU'RE "BEGAZING."
- OH.

33:55.610 --> 33:56.952
- YOU'RE "BEGAZING."

33:57.000 --> 33:58.649
- NO THANK YOU.

33:58.690 --> 34:00.066
THAT'S--THAT'S--NO WAY.
- THAT'S WHAT THAT IS.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.579
- NO! THAT'S NOT FAIR!

34:01.620 --> 34:03.269
I'M LOOKING IT UP
IN THE DICTIONARY.

[Bob Dylan's
Boots of Spanish Leather]

34:10.700 --> 34:15.831
- OH, HOW CAN--
HOW CAN YOU ASK ME AGAIN?

34:18.500 --> 34:21.219
- SO WHAT'D YOU SAY TO HIM?

34:21.260 --> 34:22.602
- SAY TO WHO?

34:22.640 --> 34:24.392
- YEAH, DON'T PLAY
DUMB WITH ME.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.840
YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

34:26.890 --> 34:30.576
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO MY ART TEACHER?

34:30.620 --> 34:35.785
- I WOULD WANT AGAIN
TOMORROW

34:37.280 --> 34:39.794
- I TOLD HIM TO STAY AWAY
FROM MY WIFE.

34:39.830 --> 34:41.969
- OH, I GOT A LETTER

34:42.010 --> 34:43.659
ON A LONESOME DAY

34:43.700 --> 34:47.101
- AND I TOLD YOU
NOTHING WAS GOING ON.

34:47.150 --> 34:50.699
- YEAH, WELL...

34:50.740 --> 34:53.425
I WANTED TO TELL HIM MYSELF.

34:55.230 --> 34:57.255
- IT WAS SO HUMILIATING.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.194
- IT'S HUMILIATING FOR YOU?

35:03.230 --> 35:05.949
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT IS FOR ME?

35:06.000 --> 35:08.639
IT'S HUMILIATING
FOR ME, CAMILLE!

35:08.690 --> 35:10.681
YOU ASK ME,

35:10.720 --> 35:13.689
AND YOU ASK ME AND ASK ME
TO SHARE MY FEELINGS WITH YOU,

35:13.730 --> 35:16.278
AND WHEN I DO,
I TELL YOU HOW I'M FEELING!

35:16.320 --> 35:20.177
THIS SITUATION
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE CRAP!

35:20.220 --> 35:23.144
AND YOU SAY, "SO WHAT?"

35:24.260 --> 35:26.660
SO I WENT TO YOUR
LITTLE PORTUGUESE POUND CAKE,

35:26.710 --> 35:30.350
AND I TOLD HIM
TO STAY AWAY FROM WHAT'S MINE.

35:32.060 --> 35:35.291
- WHAT'S YOURS?

35:35.340 --> 35:36.648
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.547
[loud clang]
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

35:39.580 --> 35:43.095
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU MEAN.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.608
ALL THIS TIME IN THERAPY!

35:45.660 --> 35:48.788
TALK ABOUT CHANGE?

35:48.830 --> 35:51.242
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.487
YOU DON'T CHANGE.
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

35:53.530 --> 35:55.998
- REALLY?

- READING.

36:19.620 --> 36:22.066
- IN THE DARK?
- IT'S NOT THAT DARK.

36:22.110 --> 36:23.486
I SHOULD GET
A BOOK LIGHT, THOUGH.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.796
- [chuckles]
- IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT.

36:26.830 --> 36:28.969
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HOW WAS YOUR DINNER?

36:29.010 --> 36:32.002
- GOOD.
- THIS IS CUTE.

36:32.050 --> 36:34.109
ALSO, I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

36:34.150 --> 36:36.869
THAT THE WHOLE
CARLY MEETING THING...

36:36.910 --> 36:38.423
- MM-HMM?

36:38.470 --> 36:40.609
- WAS PRETTY GOOD.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.768
HERE'S THE PART WHERE I TELL YOU
THAT IF YOU CRY,

36:44.820 --> 36:47.163
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DISCONTINUE
THE STORY IMMEDIATELY.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.998
OKAY?
- IT'S LIKE ICE IN THERE.

36:50.030 --> 36:51.236
- YEAH.
- I'M FINE.

36:51.270 --> 36:53.750
I THINK I'M GONNA BE
ALL RIGHT.

36:53.790 --> 36:55.587
- I DON'T KNOW.
I-I WAS NERVOUS AT FIRST,

36:55.620 --> 36:58.373
LIKE--YOU KNOW, LIKE I DIDN'T
BELONG THERE OR SOMETHING,

36:58.420 --> 37:01.139
AND, LIKE,
I WAS GONNA NOT DO WELL

37:01.180 --> 37:03.648
AND DISAPPOINT YOU, AND...

37:03.700 --> 37:07.147
THEN, YOU KNOW, I GOT IN THERE,
AND I WAS LIKE, "I CAN DO THIS."

37:07.190 --> 37:09.112
LIKE, WE WERE
KIND OF SIMILAR,

37:09.150 --> 37:11.015
AND WE WERE, LIKE,
ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH,

37:11.050 --> 37:14.087
AND IT WAS SURPRISING,

37:14.120 --> 37:15.564
AND I JUST FELT LIKE,

37:15.610 --> 37:18.602
"OKAY, YEAH, MAYBE I CAN--
MAYBE I CAN DO THIS.

37:18.650 --> 37:23.189
MAYBE I CAN, YOU KNOW, BE SMART
AND SUCCESSFUL AND..."

37:23.240 --> 37:25.811
I DON'T KNOW.
IT FELT GOOD.

37:28.590 --> 37:31.138
SO...

37:31.170 --> 37:32.444
I KNOW IT WAS PROBABLY
A BIG DEAL

37:32.490 --> 37:34.799
FOR YOU TO GET THE MEETING,

37:34.830 --> 37:37.697
AND I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAN KS.

37:37.730 --> 37:39.311
IT MEANT A LOT.

37:44.120 --> 37:47.396
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

37:47.430 --> 37:49.182
- YOU'RE CRYING.

37:49.230 --> 37:51.846
YOU'RE CRYING.
- I DID THE BEST I COULD.

37:51.890 --> 37:54.677

OH, GOD, MOM. PLEASE.

38:02.170 --> 38:03.398
- NO!

38:03.450 --> 38:06.487
- MAX, IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE MIGHT WIN THIS ONE.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.932
