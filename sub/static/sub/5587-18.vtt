00:00.334 --> 00:01.233
ADULT ADAM:  <i> Ah, the '80s,</i>

00:01.235 --> 00:03.902
<i> a time before you could</i>
<i> magically download music,</i>

00:03.904 --> 00:05.571
<i> and your stereo</i>
<i> was your pride and joy.</i>

00:05.573 --> 00:08.340
<i> Just one problem,</i>
<i> tapes cost a fortune,</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:09.108
<i> so I only owned two,</i>

00:09.110 --> 00:12.277
<i> both of which were</i>
<i> the</i> Cocktail <i> soundtrack.</i>

00:12.279 --> 00:14.446
<i> Luckily, back then, there was</i>
<i> a way to get free music.</i>

00:14.448 --> 00:16.782
MAN: (ON RADIO)
<i> And coming in at</i>
<i> number 2, Chicago.</i>

00:16.784 --> 00:20.152
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Waiting for three hours to</i>
<i> record it right off the radio.</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:23.222
<i> Unfortunately, in my house,</i>
<i> that wasn't so easy.</i>

00:23.224 --> 00:26.125
Hey, hey, Barry,
do you mind?
I'm recording Chicago.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.660
You won't hear a thing.
Look at my hands.

00:28.662 --> 00:31.163
These are the fingers
of a surgeon.

00:31.165 --> 00:31.864
(BUZZING)

00:31.866 --> 00:34.066
Not cool, funny bone!
Not cool!

00:34.068 --> 00:35.601
I'm home!
Shh!

00:35.603 --> 00:36.435
The TV's mine!

00:36.437 --> 00:37.369
Dad, I'm recording music.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.372
And I'm watching
a very special
<i> Gilligan's Island.</i>

00:40.374 --> 00:42.307
Where the Harlem Globetrotters
come to visit.

00:42.309 --> 00:43.642
Please, just give me
three minutes.

00:43.644 --> 00:47.079
I've always loved Gilligan,
and I love Meadowlark Lemon.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.515
I never thought
the two of them would meet.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.816
(BUZZING)
Damn it!

00:50.818 --> 00:52.251
Can you at least try to--

00:52.253 --> 00:53.385
I hate you and this house.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.420
I didn't even do anything.

00:54.422 --> 00:57.122
Oh, well, I suppose the car
just dented itself.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.057
(BUZZING)
Come on, man!

00:58.059 --> 00:59.525
Like I'm supposed
to believe...
(BUZZING)

00:59.527 --> 01:00.626
BARRY: Why does this
thing keep going off?

01:00.628 --> 01:03.062
...they built a basketball
court on the island!

01:03.064 --> 01:04.229
(BARKING)
BEVERLY: My own daughter...

01:04.231 --> 01:05.531
(BUZZING)
BARRY: Damn it!

01:05.533 --> 01:06.899
Damn it! Darn it!

01:06.901 --> 01:07.866
That's obviously stupid.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.168
Apparently...
(BUZZING)

01:09.170 --> 01:12.137
<i> Yep, it seemed I would never</i>
<i> get to enjoy the music I liked</i>

01:12.139 --> 01:16.308
<i> until one company</i>
<i> changed everything.</i>

01:16.310 --> 01:17.042
Columbia house.

01:17.044 --> 01:20.913
My God! How did you
get all those tapes on
a lawn mower's salary?

01:20.915 --> 01:22.714
They got this catalog
filled with albums,

01:22.716 --> 01:25.484
and they just give you
12 tapes for a penny.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.919
That deal
defies all reason.

01:26.921 --> 01:29.755
I know. I got them all.
Abba to Zappa.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.291
'Sup, pretty eyes?
Not much, DK.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.292
Sweet tapes.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.060
Yeah.
I don't know, man.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.929
There's, like,
a bunch of legal stuff here.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.231
Dave Kim doesn't read
the fine print.

01:39.233 --> 01:40.599
He lives in the moment.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.166
Tapes!

01:41.168 --> 01:42.935
ADULT ADAM: <i> It had to be</i>
<i> too good to be true.</i>

01:42.937 --> 01:46.305
<i> So I went to the biggest</i>
<i> con artist in my family,</i>

01:46.307 --> 01:46.905
<i> my big sister.</i>

01:46.907 --> 01:48.841
Sure, you get a bunch
of tapes up front,

01:48.843 --> 01:50.175
but then you enter
into a contract

01:50.177 --> 01:52.111
to order more
for full price.

01:52.113 --> 01:55.514
In the end, Columbia House
always comes for you.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.783
Man, I bet they have
like ex-navy seals

01:57.785 --> 01:58.550
to collect their money.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.486
I think you're giving them
too much credit.

02:00.488 --> 02:03.088
Point is, you can't
get something for free.

02:03.090 --> 02:03.989
Sure you can.

02:03.991 --> 02:04.823
What you do is
go into a store,

02:04.825 --> 02:06.692
take a bunch of stuff,
and then just walk out.

02:06.694 --> 02:07.726
Yeah,
that's called stealing.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.128
(MOCKING)
That's called stealing.

02:09.130 --> 02:10.829
That's what
you sound like.

02:10.831 --> 02:11.296
Wait, wait.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.366
What if I give Columbia House
a fake name

02:14.368 --> 02:15.467
and take the 12 tapes?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.970
Well, it's illegal,
but very clever.

02:17.972 --> 02:18.804
Yes! Then let's do this!

02:18.806 --> 02:21.273
As much as I would love to
commit mail fraud with you,

02:21.275 --> 02:22.908
Mom's really been
on my back lately.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.611
Aw, come on.
Commit a felony with me.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.412
It'll be a good
bonding experience,

02:27.414 --> 02:29.248
or at the very least
a cautionary tale.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.184
Whoa. Your little
brother's hardcore.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.452
Yeah, a hardcore nerd.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.419
Not anymore, Erica.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.189
Face it,
now I'm a certified badass.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.791
Schmoopie.
Muppet Babies is on.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.360
Yippee!

02:41.929 --> 02:43.529
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:43.531 --> 02:48.267
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:50.070 --> 02:50.802
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:50.804 --> 02:55.574
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:55.843 --> 02:58.277
<i> It was March 16,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:58.279 --> 03:01.013
<i> and my brother went to pick up</i>
<i> his girlfriend, Lainey.</i>

03:01.015 --> 03:04.983
<i> One problem, he had to</i>
<i> get by her dad first.</i>

03:05.052 --> 03:05.517
Lainey!

03:05.519 --> 03:08.187
The screamy kid with
the crazy eyebrows is here.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.889
Special night.
It's our 10-month anniversary.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.025
Anniversaries are for years,
not months,

03:13.027 --> 03:15.060
so you're celebrating
nothing.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.528
Let me see your wallet.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.263
Here, take it.

03:18.566 --> 03:18.964
$6?

03:18.966 --> 03:20.666
Where do you plan
to take her tonight?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.868
A vending machine
at a bus station?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.636
Oh, it's fine.
She usually pays.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.271
(CHUCKLES)
LAINEY: Hey, Bar.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.540
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

03:32.146 --> 03:33.679
Nope! Absolutely not!
(MUSIC STOPS)

03:33.681 --> 03:36.682
Shutting it down.
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:36.684 --> 03:37.182
(CHUCKLES)

03:37.184 --> 03:39.117
If that jacket hits the floor
tonight, so do you.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.586
Okay, kids,
have a great time.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.788
<i> Even though Barry had won</i>
<i> the love of his life,</i>

03:42.790 --> 03:46.291
<i> it was becoming clear</i>
<i> he had not won over her dad.</i>

03:46.293 --> 03:47.159
(SIGHS)
<i> Yet.</i>

03:47.161 --> 03:49.761
Nothing like a cold one
after work, am I right?

03:49.763 --> 03:50.462
Amen to that, brother!

03:50.464 --> 03:53.565
Love me the old brew ha-ha,
nectar of the gods,

03:53.567 --> 03:56.568
foam hammer, wheat and greet,
little truth water,

03:56.570 --> 03:59.271
golden problem solver,
beer.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.139
Move over, rover.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.975
Are you telling me you drink?
No!

04:02.977 --> 04:05.077
You just said
you love cold suds.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.846
So which is it?
Are you a lush or a liar?

04:07.848 --> 04:10.482
He's a moron.
I'm gonna grab us
a refill, Mur.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.918
You want a six pack,
Mickey Mantle?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.019
Mmm-mmm.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.355
Why?
I'm probably being
a little paranoid,

04:16.357 --> 04:18.790
but it kind of seems like
Bill hates my living guts.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.392
(WHOOPING) He sure does!

04:20.394 --> 04:21.126
I don't get it.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.263
Mom says I'm literally
a human ray of sunshine.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.063
Your mom's a nice lady,

04:25.065 --> 04:26.832
but she's done
some real damage to you.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.934
I need Bill
to be my friend.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.802
He's like a father
to Lainey.

04:30.804 --> 04:31.637
You're the boyfriend.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.506
No dad likes the guy
who's dating his daughter.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.074
So it's not personal.

04:36.076 --> 04:37.175
Yes!

04:37.177 --> 04:38.010
Top shelf.

04:38.012 --> 04:39.444
Yeah, throw this away.
No.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.079
I'll time you.
Okay, got to beat my record.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.881
<i> While Barry was</i>
<i> happily distracted,</i>

04:42.883 --> 04:46.351
<i> I was focused on pulling off</i>
<i> the biggest scam ever.</i>

04:46.353 --> 04:47.819
Dude,
what are you doing?

04:47.821 --> 04:48.854
I've had a revelation.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.523
Why create one fake name
and get 12 tapes,

04:51.525 --> 04:53.959
when you can create
infinite fake names

04:53.961 --> 04:54.993
and get all the tapes?

04:54.995 --> 04:57.195
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

04:57.197 --> 04:58.897
I've thought of everything,
Erica.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.800
See, Columbia House
has agents everywhere

05:01.802 --> 05:03.001
looking to collect
their money.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.971
But I'll be one step ahead
of them with this.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.039
Each of my phony identities

05:07.041 --> 05:08.840
has elaborately
fleshed-out backstories

05:08.842 --> 05:11.009
that I've completely
committed to memory.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.811
Optimus O'Prime?
Really, dude?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.579
Whose first name
is Optimus?

05:14.581 --> 05:15.380
This guy.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.948
He's a 41-year-old
truck driver

05:16.950 --> 05:18.617
who spends his long nights
on the road

05:18.619 --> 05:22.087
jamming to the soft-rock
stylings of Chicago.

05:22.089 --> 05:22.788
Ugh, why?

05:22.790 --> 05:25.157
Because I'm playing God,
Erica.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.425
Meet Dr. Garth Vader Stein.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.660
He's got asthma
and issues with his son.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.397
He's also got an insane love
of Hall & Oates.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.399
Well,
we all have hobbies.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.735
Next, meet Stu Voltron,
age 43.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.103
He's a divorced
veterinarian.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.672
The only thing he loves
more than animals?

05:40.674 --> 05:41.139
Billy Joel.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.575
I think maybe you should
pump the brakes

05:43.577 --> 05:44.676
on your life of crime.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.144
I think you should beat it,
narc.

05:46.146 --> 05:49.247
(DOORBELL RINGS)
(GASPS) Yay, tapes.

05:49.416 --> 05:52.684
ADULT ADAM: <i> For mere pennies,</i>
<i> I had enough soft rock</i>

05:52.686 --> 05:54.619
<i> for two lifetimes.</i>

05:54.621 --> 05:55.153
Wow.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.655
That's a whole lot
of music cassettes.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.091
How did you get the money
for all that?

05:59.093 --> 06:00.292
Do you want to
ask questions?

06:00.294 --> 06:02.928
Or do you want a little
Neil Diamond?

06:03.464 --> 06:04.229
I saw nothing.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.998
Good answer.
<i> As I was in way over my head,</i>

06:07.000 --> 06:10.869
<i> Barry was trying to</i>
<i> make some headway with Bill.</i>

06:12.206 --> 06:13.472
(LAUGHS)

06:13.474 --> 06:14.740
There he is.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.640
It's happening.

06:15.642 --> 06:18.210
He's changed his mind
about me.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.246
Anthony Balsamo,
you old son of a gun.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.482
Where you been?
Why don't you
come around anymore?

06:23.484 --> 06:25.283
'Cause your beautiful
daughter broke up with me.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.152
Ah, women.
Who can understand them?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.820
Hey, when am I gonna see you
out on the links again?

06:28.822 --> 06:30.322
My buddy and I have
a tee time this weekend.

06:30.324 --> 06:34.192
You should caddy for me.
Keep this duffer
on the green.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.129
Look out! (LAUGHS)
(LAUGHS) Hey.

06:37.398 --> 06:37.796
Ugh.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.031
I hate it when my dad
talks golf with my ex.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.633
They used to do it
all the time when we dated.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.769
Your dad liked him
while you two were dating?

06:43.771 --> 06:45.337
I thought he hated me
'cause I'm your boyfriend.

06:45.339 --> 06:48.607
Oh, sweetie, no.
My dad hates you as,
like, a person.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.209
You being my boyfriend
is just a happy coincidence.

06:51.211 --> 06:51.843
Well, don't worry.

06:51.845 --> 06:55.046
I know a man who's got
the inside track on your dad,

06:55.048 --> 06:58.617
and he'll be more than
happy to help me.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.453
Mmm, yeah, uh...

07:01.455 --> 07:04.322
What is that?
Is that a yes or a no?

07:04.324 --> 07:05.991
Yeah... No...

07:05.993 --> 07:08.393
You're mashing
yes and no together.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.762
Speak clearly
in English words.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.031
No... yeah, uh...

07:13.033 --> 07:13.665
Come on, Dad.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.734
You're Bill's best friend.
Just talk to him for me.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.470
Talk? We mostly sit in
comfortable silence and drink.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.873
You never once told him
how cool or funny
or athletic I am?

07:21.875 --> 07:24.643
You know, it's never come up,
and I don't think
it ever will.

07:24.645 --> 07:25.911
Can you at least tell him
how good I am

07:25.913 --> 07:28.213
at getting all the shampoo
out of my hair in the shower?

07:28.215 --> 07:28.914
As a favor to you, no.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.450
Did you tell him
how I can palm
a volleyball?

07:31.452 --> 07:33.185
No, 'cause you can't
do it consistently.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.120
Tell him how good I am
at all-you-can-eat shrimp.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.122
That red lobster hates me,
tell him.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.123
No.
Fine.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.225
If you're not gonna
tell him about me,

07:40.227 --> 07:40.959
at least tell me about him.

07:40.961 --> 07:45.363
All I can tell you is
he likes cheesesteaks
and the cowboys.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.798
That's all you know
about him?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.401
Oh! He also likes
John Denver.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.470
Perfect.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.270
Who are you? Dr. Doom?

07:52.272 --> 07:54.639
<i> And so my brother was</i>
<i> scheming to win over Bill.</i>

07:54.641 --> 07:58.243
<i> Meanwhile, my mom was</i>
<i> about to get wise</i>
<i> to my scheme.</i>

07:58.245 --> 08:00.278
Got a package
for Papa Smurfenstein.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.047
I think you've got
the wrong address.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.582
I suppose that means
there's also

08:03.584 --> 08:05.584
no Inspector Gidget?
No.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.985
Gary Grayskull?
No.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.553
Snake Plotkin?
No.

08:08.555 --> 08:09.754
Ivan Drago?
No.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.423
John McClaneberg?
No.

08:11.425 --> 08:13.358
Hulk Hulkerstein?
No.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.426
General Zod?
No.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.261
Jean Claude
Van Thunderdome?

08:16.263 --> 08:18.330
What's going on?
Let me guess.

08:18.332 --> 08:18.964
You have teenagers?

08:18.966 --> 08:20.832
Well,
one of them's been using

08:20.834 --> 08:22.601
a lot of fake names
to get free tapes.

08:22.603 --> 08:26.438
Well, I think it's obvious
who's responsible.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.839
Me?
Yes, you.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.040
Who else would it be?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.008
ERICA: Kermit D. Fonz?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.510
That's got Adam
written all over it.

08:31.512 --> 08:35.013
You expect me to believe
that Adam did this?
Yes.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.214
Adam?
Adam.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.716
My delicious little
snuggle monster?

08:37.718 --> 08:39.217
Yes, Adam.
Adam?

08:39.219 --> 08:41.253
He's guilty.
Tell her you're guilty.

08:41.255 --> 08:43.722
Why does she say
these things, Mama?

08:43.724 --> 08:44.956
I'm just a little boy.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.659
See? He has an alibi.
He's a little boy.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.561
Why do you always blame me
for everything?

08:49.563 --> 08:51.496
Just open the box
and look at the tapes,

08:51.498 --> 08:53.465
and you'll see
it wasn't me.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.133
(SIGHS)

08:55.135 --> 08:57.769
"Weird Al,
The songs of Fraggle Rock,

08:57.771 --> 08:59.404
"The best of
Andrew Lloyd Webber."

08:59.406 --> 09:04.042
And, finally,
"101 farts, volume 2."

09:05.012 --> 09:08.947
Hope it was worth it, Erica.
You're grounded for a month.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.415
No phone, no crimper.

09:10.417 --> 09:13.718
A month with smooth hair?
Are you crazy?

09:14.288 --> 09:15.353
Tell her!

09:15.355 --> 09:17.489
Okay, fine.
It really was me.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.723
(STUTTERS)
It was such a good deal.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.492
I got caught
in the heat of the moment.

09:20.494 --> 09:23.194
Which is also a song I got
for a fraction of a penny.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.964
Shh, you don't have to
lie for her anymore.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.165
Seriously?
What?

09:27.167 --> 09:29.167
Let mama make you
a banana split.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.836
(CHUCKLES) Okay?
You get nothing.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.072
Oof, tough break.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.474
Take Sheila E.
For your troubles.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.411
(CLATTERING)
This is ridiculous.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.178
Why do I always get blamed

09:40.180 --> 09:42.581
for everything that goes
wrong in this house?

09:42.583 --> 09:43.548
'Cause you do most of it.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.417
You know,
if Mom thinks I'm so bad,

09:45.419 --> 09:49.054
maybe it's time to show her
how bad I can really be.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.357
Wait,
this was you holding back?

09:52.359 --> 09:55.527
Oh, this is not good.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.064
<i> Tired of being labeled</i>
<i> the troublemaker,</i>

09:59.066 --> 10:02.100
<i> my sister decided to</i>
<i> live up to her name.</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:02.767
Wow, yeah, okay.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.669
Let's do this.
Let's shoplift.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.838
Trust me,
it's super fun and easy.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.808
And also the only thing that
really makes me feel alive.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.042
Ooh! Fanny packs.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.310
I mean, how much worse
is shoplifting

10:12.312 --> 10:14.379
than scamming Columbia House
anyway?

10:14.381 --> 10:15.847
Getting 12 tapes
for a penny

10:15.849 --> 10:18.617
is like the same thing
as shoplifting.

10:18.619 --> 10:19.084
Just a tip.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.320
Maybe don't say
"shoplifting" so much
while you're shoplifting.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.421
Right, gotcha.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.190
'Cause we're not
shoplifting,

10:25.192 --> 10:26.825
which is, by the way,
totally a victimless crime.

10:26.827 --> 10:31.096
I'm hearing
a lot of justifying
and not a lot of stealing.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.764
Catch up, girl.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.733
<i> Yep, my sister was ready</i>
<i> for a life of crime</i>

10:34.735 --> 10:38.803
<i> just as Barry was preparing</i>
<i> to steal Bill's heart.</i>

10:39.339 --> 10:39.838
Gentlemen!

10:39.840 --> 10:41.840
Thought you might like to
load up on some
meat and cheese

10:41.842 --> 10:44.342
before an active day
in the hot sun.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.510
You're a fan, right, Bill?

10:45.512 --> 10:47.879
Of Geno's cheesesteaks.
You bought Pat's.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.047
Why not just punch me
in the face?

10:49.049 --> 10:52.150
Aren't they directly across
the street from each other

10:52.152 --> 10:53.618
with the exact same
ingredients?

10:53.620 --> 10:55.820
Go on, punch my face.
Do it.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.823
Or we go to
the eagles-cowboys game.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.059
50-yard line,
root for America's team?

11:01.061 --> 11:03.194
I thought you were
a diehard Eagles fan.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.362
Until I discovered
the Cowboys,

11:04.364 --> 11:07.399
my other favorite team,
which happens to be yours.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.668
You're gonna turn on
the Eagles just like that?

11:09.670 --> 11:11.603
Son, don't you have
any spine at all?

11:11.605 --> 11:14.239
No. But you know
what I do have?

11:14.374 --> 11:17.275
Matching bucket hats!

11:17.277 --> 11:17.909
Why?
Oh, no.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.844
'Cause you love
Bob Denver.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.946
You know, Gilligan,
from the island.

11:21.948 --> 11:22.814
What?
He's my favorite, too.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.650
I don't like Bob Denver.
I like John Denver.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.519
Is there a difference?
Oh, no.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.855
Yes, one is folk icon
who melts my heart.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.257
The other
is a scrawny weirdo

11:32.259 --> 11:34.859
who couldn't close with
Ginger or Mary Ann.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.796
(LAUGHS) I totally
know the difference.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.897
I'm just busting chops.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.166
I just got you this hat
so your head won't burn.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.200
Are you calling me bald?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.769
No, you have
a beautiful head of hair.

11:44.771 --> 11:45.704
On the sides.

11:45.706 --> 11:46.805
You look like a judge.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.039
Well,
it's almost tee time.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.208
Come on, Barry.
You're gonna come
with us today.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.076
He is?
I am?

11:51.078 --> 11:53.278
Yeah, I invited the boy
to join us.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.079
You did?
You did?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.081
Yeah, Barry and I play
golf all the time.

11:56.083 --> 11:56.915
It's our thing.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.550
I've never golfed with you,
not once.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.419
Moron,
I'm doing you a solid.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.354
Don't blow this.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.458
<i> My dad did Barry</i>
<i> the rare solid.</i>

12:06.460 --> 12:11.162
<i> Now, all Barry had to do</i>
<i> was drive it home with Bill.</i>

12:11.164 --> 12:15.033
Ah, golf.
The sport of kings.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.267
And queens, equal rights.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.670
(CHUCKLES)
I respect your foxy daughter.

12:18.672 --> 12:21.439
No, not foxy,
she's an uggo to me.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.373
Not everyone else.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.844
They all think she has
an awesome, plump butt.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.012
What the (BLEEP), man?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.783
Okay, you're trying
way too hard.

12:31.785 --> 12:32.851
I get it, be myself.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.053
No,
don't do that either.

12:35.055 --> 12:35.653
Wild Bill!

12:35.655 --> 12:38.022
You need a caddy?
There he is.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.157
Anthony Balsamo's here?

12:39.159 --> 12:41.226
I can't compete with him.
He's a total babe.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.495
Relax, you're playing
golf with Bill.

12:43.497 --> 12:45.797
He's just the caddy.
You're right.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.233
He's the caddy,
the guy behind the guy.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.835
He's the one in Bill's ear
whispering sweet advice.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.004
That's what I got to do.
Not what I meant.

12:53.006 --> 12:56.941
Hey, pretty boy.
Take a lap, I got this.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.512
Just give me a sec.
I'll catch up.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.223
Hey, I got a package
for Lucky Goldberg.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.858
Gonna need
your signature.

13:13.860 --> 13:14.626
Yeah, Lucky's a dog.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.195
Then I don't know
what to do.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.963
Please don't
slam the door.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.131
The nerve of that Erica.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.499
First she frames her brother,

13:21.501 --> 13:23.501
and then she ropes in
our sweet little puppy.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.937
You're not cut out
for a life of crime.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.272
You're just a cockapoo.

13:27.274 --> 13:27.939
I ordered the tapes.

13:27.941 --> 13:31.543
I mean, it's like
that girl doesn't ever
hear a word I say.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.378
I ordered the tapes.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.012
She's my daughter.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.080
How come she refuses
to listen to me?

13:36.082 --> 13:39.584
My God, woman.
I ordered the damn tapes.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.520
I saw Adam do it,
and I wanted in.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.955
Wait. It was you?

13:43.957 --> 13:46.457
<i> With that,</i>
<i> my mom finally realized</i>

13:46.459 --> 13:48.459
<i> she did blame Erica</i>
<i> for everything,</i>

13:48.461 --> 13:50.862
<i> even when she was</i>
<i> clearly innocent.</i>

13:50.864 --> 13:51.930
Uh, Mom?

13:51.932 --> 13:54.232
It's for you.
Erica's in mall jail.

13:54.234 --> 13:58.002
<i> And two seconds later,</i>
<i> Erica was back</i>
<i> to being guilty.</i>

13:58.004 --> 14:02.006
I stole something else,
but you're never
gonna find it.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.509
Your friend's weird.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.377
(SIGHS) There you are.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.679
Classic Erica.

14:07.681 --> 14:08.780
You know,
I actually started to think

14:08.782 --> 14:12.350
maybe I'd been
too hard on you,
and then you go and shoplift?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.753
And the worst thing is
I'm not even surprised.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.522
Actually, your daughter
didn't do anything wrong.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.224
I was just having her
stick around

14:19.226 --> 14:22.327
because this one
is freaking me out.

14:22.329 --> 14:22.861
It's true.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.530
Erica tried to talk me out
of it, and I didn't listen.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.565
Oh, God,
my stomach's in knots.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.467
Can I use the bathroom?

14:29.469 --> 14:30.501
This way.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.704
<i> Accusing Erica yet again</i>
<i> didn't help matters.</i>

14:32.706 --> 14:36.040
<i> Luckily, my mom</i>
<i> had a way with words.</i>

14:36.042 --> 14:37.876
So...

14:38.745 --> 14:41.613
Honest mistake, you know?

14:42.015 --> 14:43.281
Pedicures, my treat?

14:43.283 --> 14:46.050
You know, you made me
feel like such a bad person

14:46.052 --> 14:48.086
that I actually thought
about stealing.

14:48.088 --> 14:48.887
Schmoo, I'm sorry--

14:48.889 --> 14:52.156
I don't want to hear
you're sorry ever again.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.591
No matter what I do,

14:53.593 --> 14:56.461
you're always gonna expect
the worst from me.

14:56.463 --> 15:01.966
You have no idea how hard
that is coming from you.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.801
No idea.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.407
CARLA: You'll never
catch me, mall hog!

15:09.409 --> 15:11.643
I feel so alive!

15:14.848 --> 15:17.415
<i> Even though Bill Lewis was</i>
<i> having the round of his life,</i>

15:17.417 --> 15:21.052
<i> my brother was having no luck</i>
<i> breaking the ice.</i>

15:21.054 --> 15:22.787
Being a caddy sucks.

15:22.789 --> 15:26.858
All Bill wants me to do
is wash his balls
and hold his bag.

15:26.860 --> 15:27.959
It's funny but hard work.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.594
I told you
not to caddy for him.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.529
(SIGHS) I messed
this whole thing up.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.398
I'll never get
another shot with Bill.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.667
All right.
I'm gonna help you.

15:35.669 --> 15:36.401
For real?
Yeah.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.337
But this counts
as your birthday present.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.539
Hey, Bill.
Tweaked my shoulder.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.308
Barry's gonna finish
the round for me.

15:43.310 --> 15:46.411
(SIGHS)
Gonna use a driver
on this one.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.211
You're 60 yards out.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.380
Don't use my expensive driver
for this chip shot.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.016
Uh-uh-uh.
No talking in my backswing.

15:52.018 --> 15:55.486
I learned that after
I did it to you three times.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.754
<i> It was now or never.</i>

15:56.756 --> 15:59.757
<i> Barry would have to</i>
<i> dig down deep inside himself</i>

15:59.759 --> 16:02.627
<i> and do the impossible.</i>

16:05.799 --> 16:07.432
Son of a bitch.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.533
That's about right.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.069
It's okay. I got this.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.170
Whoa!

16:12.172 --> 16:13.771
Way colder than I thought.

16:13.773 --> 16:17.041
<i> As Barry desperately flailed</i>
<i> in that murky golf pond,</i>

16:17.043 --> 16:20.445
<i> my dad realized</i>
<i> the kid really needed</i>
<i> a life preserver.</i>

16:20.447 --> 16:23.514
Starting to see
why you call him
moron so much.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.450
Yeah, well, the thing is

16:25.452 --> 16:27.986
he's the sweetest moron
you'd ever want to meet.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.487
And he loves
your daughter,

16:29.489 --> 16:32.623
so much that he'd do
anything to impress you.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.026
BARRY: I'm feeling around
with my feet.

16:35.028 --> 16:35.793
It's mostly old golf balls

16:35.795 --> 16:39.063
and something with scales
that's not afraid of humans.

16:39.065 --> 16:43.034
So, please,
cut the kid some slack.

16:43.036 --> 16:43.935
BARRY: Oh!

16:43.937 --> 16:45.203
I think I drowned a little.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.238
It was a very
peaceful feeling.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.541
I saw my old gerbil.
I'm going back in.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.311
There's my baby.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.981
I made you your favorite.
Cheeseburger lasagna.

16:56.983 --> 16:57.348
Pass.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.317
I don't want to get blamed
if you burn it,

16:59.319 --> 17:01.886
so I'll just eat
a lunchable.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.722
But... Those are for lunch.

17:04.724 --> 17:05.590
It's the wrong meal.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.292
Wow, you really have
failed as a mother.

17:08.294 --> 17:10.995
Hey. I'm the only one
allowed to say that.

17:10.997 --> 17:11.662
Well, it's true.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.165
You punished Erica
for something I did,

17:14.167 --> 17:16.000
almost turning her
to a life of crime.

17:16.002 --> 17:18.736
If that ain't failing,
I don't know what is.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.238
Oh, you're right.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.839
I want to
tell her I'm sorry,

17:21.841 --> 17:23.107
but she refuses
to hear it from me.

17:23.109 --> 17:26.978
<i> It dawned on me</i>
<i> that I could finally</i>
<i> use my crime for good.</i>

17:26.980 --> 17:30.548
Maybe there's someone else
who can say it.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.349
<i> Thanks to my scam,</i>

17:31.351 --> 17:33.518
<i> there was one tape</i>
<i> that was worth every penny.</i>

17:33.520 --> 17:37.755
<i> And it was the perfect way</i>
<i> to say "I'm sorry."</i>

17:37.757 --> 17:38.856
Honey.

17:38.858 --> 17:39.524
Go away.

17:39.526 --> 17:43.394
I'm trying to enjoy my
four crackers and ham square.

17:43.396 --> 17:43.761
Look.

17:43.763 --> 17:47.165
I don't blame you
for acting out after
the way I treated you.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.701
I really don't want to talk
right now, or ever.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.703
Well, you don't have to

17:52.705 --> 17:56.841
because I found a band
that'll do it for us.

17:58.478 --> 18:02.313
<i> Sure, Columbia House drove</i>
<i> Erica and my mom far apart,</i>

18:02.315 --> 18:05.149
<i> but it would also bring them</i>
<i> closer than ever.</i>

18:05.151 --> 18:06.884
<i> ¶ Everybody needs</i>
<i> a little time away</i>

18:06.886 --> 18:09.153
<i> ¶ Everybody needs</i>
<i> a little time away</i>

18:09.155 --> 18:10.054
No, not Chicago.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.457
<i> ¶ I heard her say</i>
<i> ¶ I heard her say</i>

18:12.459 --> 18:13.624
Stop doing
what you're doing.

18:13.626 --> 18:18.796
<i> ¶ Far away...</i>
<i> ¶ Far away from their mother</i>

18:18.798 --> 18:20.098
Don't make the words
about you.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.533
<i> ¶ Hold me, schmoo</i>
This is a nightmare.

18:22.535 --> 18:27.038
<i> ¶ It's hard for me</i>
<i> to say I'm sorry</i>

18:27.307 --> 18:31.242
<i> ¶ I just want you to stay</i>

18:31.244 --> 18:32.643
This is the worst.

18:32.645 --> 18:37.982
(SNIFFLES)
<i> ¶ After all</i>
<i> that we've been through</i>

18:38.084 --> 18:41.552
<i> ¶ I will make it up to you</i>

18:42.422 --> 18:45.623
<i> ¶ I promise to</i>

18:46.526 --> 18:51.095
<i> ¶ And after all that's been</i>
<i> said and done</i>

18:51.097 --> 18:57.335
(BOTH SINGING)
<i> ¶ You're just the part of me</i>
<i> I can't let go</i>

18:57.337 --> 19:00.638
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And with the help</i>
<i> of one soft-rock band,</i>

19:00.640 --> 19:03.741
<i> my mom was truly</i>
<i> able to say sorry.</i>

19:03.743 --> 19:07.945
<i> ¶ Couldn't stand</i>
<i> to be kept away ¶</i>

19:08.915 --> 19:11.115
There he is.
You old son of a gun.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.550
Are you talking to me?
Yeah.

19:12.552 --> 19:16.420
Hey, sweetie. Can I have
a minute with my caddy?

19:17.190 --> 19:18.589
No.

19:19.225 --> 19:20.691
Be nice.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.328
(SIGHS)

19:25.999 --> 19:26.497
Listen.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.400
I know I've been hard on you,
but there's a reason.

19:29.402 --> 19:32.403
'Cause I'm not awesome
like Anthony Balsamo?

19:32.405 --> 19:33.471
(SCOFFS) No.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.105
To tell the truth,

19:34.107 --> 19:36.774
I knew those other guys
were just a flash in the pan.

19:36.776 --> 19:41.612
But what you two have,
it's the real deal.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.047
You think so?

19:43.049 --> 19:46.384
Yeah. It's...scary.

19:46.386 --> 19:50.454
I guess I'm just not ready
to lose my little girl.

19:50.456 --> 19:54.258
But I'm gonna try
to be better about it.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.028
<i> Inspired by the girl</i>
<i> they both loved,</i>

19:57.030 --> 20:00.698
<i> Bill decided to start</i>
<i> a new chapter with Barry.</i>
(LAUGHS)

20:00.700 --> 20:04.969
<i> As for me, I closed the book</i>
<i> on my life of crime.</i>

20:04.971 --> 20:06.871
Not so fun getting grounded
for a month, huh?

20:06.873 --> 20:10.308
Honestly, it's a relief.
I was on a dark road.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.243
Farewell,
Garth Vader Stein.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.211
Nice knowing you.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.780
Don't talk to him, Erica.
He's grounded.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.381
You know, you could learn
a thing or two

20:17.383 --> 20:18.249
from your big sister.

20:18.251 --> 20:21.352
<i> And my mom finally</i>
<i> turned a new page</i>
<i> with Erica.</i>

20:21.354 --> 20:23.321
I really could.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.257
Made you a banana split.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.092
You get nothing.

20:29.128 --> 20:31.362
Hey, jailbird.
Want to split this?

20:31.364 --> 20:32.096
I would like that.

20:32.098 --> 20:35.199
<i> Growing up,</i>
<i> we're all seen a certain way.</i>

20:35.201 --> 20:38.402
Yes! Mark it down.
octuple-bogey!

20:38.404 --> 20:38.769
Whoo!

20:38.771 --> 20:44.008
<i> But the people you love</i>
<i> always see you</i>
<i> for who you really are.</i>

20:44.010 --> 20:46.210
He's a moron.
He really is.

20:46.212 --> 20:49.513
<i> And that's something</i>
<i> worth celebrating.</i>

20:52.385 --> 20:55.820
ADAM: This is my tapes,
my other tapes.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.394
Welcome to Contempo Casuals.

21:03.396 --> 21:04.962
Did you find
all the hot styles

21:04.964 --> 21:05.963
you were looking for today?

21:05.965 --> 21:08.366
What? Since when
do you work here?

21:08.368 --> 21:09.634
I had no choice.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.335
I'm into Columbia House, deep

21:11.337 --> 21:13.704
They send me
letters every day.

21:13.706 --> 21:14.605
I owe them hundreds.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.908
I told you to read
the fine print, Dave Kim.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.410
Shh! Don't say my name!

21:19.412 --> 21:20.411
They have agents everywhere.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.380
Look, that girl checking out
the stirrup pants.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.849
She's here for me.
I don't have your money, man.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.985
I'll get it!
Just give me time!

21:27.987 --> 21:30.655
(CRYING)
I need more time.
