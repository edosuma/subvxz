WEBVTT

00:05.871 --> 00:09.168
Shirley, I am not going through this again.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.921
Would someone catch me up here?

00:10.921 --> 00:12.340
Denny got engaged.

00:12.382 --> 00:14.468
–Mazel tov?
–No mazel tov.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.303
–Who is it this time?
–Beverly Bridge.

00:16.303 --> 00:17.932
The woman Denny “craned” in the

00:17.932 --> 00:19.685
coatroom at that charity dinner last week.

00:19.685 --> 00:22.774
If this Bev turns out to be
another Angie, oh, God!

00:22.857 --> 00:24.443
–Angie?
–Number four.

00:24.527 --> 00:26.204
Wife number five was no picnic either.

00:26.204 --> 00:26.942
Clovis.

00:26.977 --> 00:28.211
She most got him to retire,

00:28.211 --> 00:30.546
pull his equity out of the firm
and move to Boca.

00:30.546 --> 00:33.159
–Clovis nearly sunk us.
–Half the staff quit.

00:33.159 --> 00:36.281
And she was drunk the day
president Ford stopped by.

00:36.337 --> 00:40.225
All right, I'll pull out Denny's last prenup,
see if I can water-seal it.

00:40.225 --> 00:42.779
Shirley, you talk to the woman.
Get her story.

00:42.779 --> 00:45.335
Brad, check the partnership agreement.

00:45.370 --> 00:46.823
We have to be sure there are no

00:46.823 --> 00:48.206
loopholes in the mandatory buyout

00:48.206 --> 00:50.505
in case of a partner's death or incapacity.

00:50.505 --> 00:52.164
–One thing.
–What?

00:52.199 --> 00:56.454
Is there any remote possibility
we could be overreacting here?

00:59.209 --> 01:05.510
♫ I had the time of my life ♫

01:05.594 --> 01:09.560

02:03.566 --> 02:06.506
Docket number 249635.

02:06.548 --> 02:09.198
Commonwealth vs. Jerald Espenson.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.771
Attempted murder, assault,

02:10.771 --> 02:12.139
assault with a deadly weapon,

02:12.139 --> 02:15.080
battery, sexual battery, false imprisonment,

02:15.121 --> 02:17.150
torture, terrorist threats.

02:17.192 --> 02:17.943
Alan Shore for the

02:17.943 --> 02:20.091
preposterously charged Mr Espenson.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.037
Frank Ginsberg for the commonwealth.

02:22.037 --> 02:23.050
How do you plead?

02:23.115 --> 02:25.599
Not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.

02:25.599 --> 02:26.339
As to bail?

02:26.374 --> 02:28.969
We ask that Mr Espenson be released
on his own recognizance.

02:28.969 --> 02:31.490
–Commonwealth opposes bail.
–You can't be serious!

02:31.490 --> 02:33.722
Your honor, this incident was an aberration.

02:33.722 --> 02:36.880
Mr Espenson is an upstanding member of his community,

02:36.910 --> 02:38.832
he is not a danger to society,

02:38.866 --> 02:41.631
and he has a family counting on him at home.

02:41.666 --> 02:43.251
He has dependents?

02:43.286 --> 02:44.802
Her name is Linda.

02:44.837 --> 02:46.876
Your honor, let the record show

02:46.911 --> 02:48.699
that his dependent is a gecko.

02:48.725 --> 02:50.519
Mr Espenson threatened to kill

02:50.554 --> 02:52.313
his boss in her place of business

02:52.313 --> 02:54.771
and has a history of violent outbursts.

02:54.806 --> 02:56.559
–He could be a flight risk.
–Flight risk?

02:56.559 --> 02:58.346
The man can't even hail a cab.

03:00.465 --> 03:01.229
Sorry.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.986
It is incumbent upon the commonwealth to protect the community at large.

03:04.986 --> 03:08.136
God forbid he's released
and hurts someone else.

03:08.279 --> 03:09.571
Bail is denied.

03:09.605 --> 03:13.009
Defendant shall be remanded into custody immediately.

03:13.283 --> 03:14.577
Meal worms are in the fridge.

03:14.577 --> 03:16.298
I need to feed Linda. I need to get home.

03:16.298 --> 03:17.872
Jerry, I'll feed Linda.

03:35.692 --> 03:39.032
Sexual battery, torture,
terrorist threats?

03:39.074 --> 03:41.772
That isn't justice.
It's disproportionate retribution.

03:41.772 --> 03:42.523
And good for you.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.781
You've enlisted the one prosecutor
who's running for DA next year.

03:45.781 --> 03:47.772
Tell me, how big was
your campaign contribution?

03:47.772 --> 03:50.302
And is there a matching fund
here at the firm we can all go in on?

03:50.302 --> 03:52.691
It was sizeable, and speak to Kim
in accounting.

03:52.691 --> 03:53.952
Jerry Espenson never intended…

03:53.952 --> 03:56.185
Do not start defending him
to me, Alan.

03:56.185 --> 03:57.264
I agreed to defend him.

03:57.264 --> 03:58.546
That's why he put down the knife.

03:58.546 --> 03:59.758
No, you agreed to represent him.

03:59.758 --> 04:01.335
No one here meant for you
to defend him.

04:01.335 --> 04:04.336
Shirley, no one is denying
what this man has done to you,

04:04.336 --> 04:06.325
but he should at least get a fair trial.

04:06.325 --> 04:07.403
Oh, by all means.

04:07.438 --> 04:09.948
Let's get a fair trial for the man
who tried to slit my throat.

04:09.948 --> 04:10.525
Let's.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.966
But understand that everyone
at this firm is considered a witness.

04:12.966 --> 04:15.803
Don't expect anyone to help you
or speak to you.

04:15.803 --> 04:18.571
And won't that make
for a refreshing change?

04:19.202 --> 04:22.365
Shirley, have you talked
to Denny's fiancée yet?

04:22.400 --> 04:24.338
I've been a little busy, Paul.

04:24.373 --> 04:27.625
I'm working on the prenup, but
we need you to find out her intentions.

04:27.625 --> 04:30.535
You're the one with the kind eyes.
I don't do girl talk.

04:30.535 --> 04:33.411
Do I have to remind you
how serious this situation is?

04:33.411 --> 04:36.032
If Denny becomes incapacitated…

04:37.017 --> 04:39.435
or should I say further incapacitated,

04:39.470 --> 04:41.854
this woman could become his Nancy Reagan.

04:41.854 --> 04:45.698
She'd have his power of attorney.
She could bring down the firm.

04:46.005 --> 04:47.434
I'll talk to her.

04:53.054 --> 04:56.186
–Daniel.
–I came to take you to lunch.

04:56.227 --> 04:59.317
–I can't. I have a case.
–What is it?

04:59.400 --> 05:00.986
A high school teacher is

05:01.069 --> 05:02.607
seeking a temporary restraining order

05:02.607 --> 05:04.117
against one of her student's parents.

05:04.117 --> 05:05.662
They're hounding the woman day and

05:05.662 --> 05:07.207
night about their daughter's grades.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.743
–Helicopter parents.
–Helicopter parents?

05:09.778 --> 05:10.776
Well, that's what they call them now,

05:10.776 --> 05:12.588
you know, parents who hover around their kids,

05:12.588 --> 05:14.366
try to control every aspect of their lives.

05:14.366 --> 05:15.657
That would be the Gœrings.

05:15.657 --> 05:16.876
Well, cool, I'm in.

05:17.595 --> 05:18.632
What?

05:19.032 --> 05:21.221
I want to second chair.

05:21.256 --> 05:24.024
Why not? I got my law degree.
I keep up with my MCLEs.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.621
Have you ever actually tried a case?

05:25.621 --> 05:27.498
No, but I've always wanted to.

05:27.533 --> 05:32.037
Think of it as the make-a-wish foundation
granting a dying kid his fantasy.

05:33.059 --> 05:36.626
If that kid were a rich guy in his 40s.

05:37.381 --> 05:39.169
Besides, I can probably help you.

05:39.169 --> 05:41.770
I'm on the board of the Lexington school.
My kids used to go there.

05:41.770 --> 05:43.906
We deal with helicopter parents
all the time.

05:43.906 --> 05:44.929
That could be helpful.

05:44.929 --> 05:46.811
I would have to get
the client's approval, though.

05:46.811 --> 05:47.525
I can get that.

05:47.525 --> 05:49.440
And I would have to get
one of the partners to agree.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.437
Looks like a partner right there.

05:54.602 --> 05:56.304
–Daniel Post.
–Denny Crane.

05:56.387 --> 05:57.933
–I'm a client.
–I'm a partner.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.101
–CEO, Kreisberg-Pellum.
–My name's on the door.

06:00.101 --> 06:02.235
–I love the offices.
–Thank you. I love your hair.

06:02.235 --> 06:03.613
–I got a plane.
–Indeed?

06:03.613 --> 06:04.954
Could use a little more color, though.

06:04.954 --> 06:05.846
I'll make a note.

06:05.846 --> 06:07.528
My fiancée sells office furniture.

06:07.528 --> 06:09.486
Congratulations. I'd love to meet her.

06:09.486 --> 06:11.409
My club, Thursdays.
They serve Reubens.

06:11.409 --> 06:12.259
I'll take you flying.

06:12.259 --> 06:14.036
Oh, by the way, I'd like to try

06:14.036 --> 06:15.778
a case with Ms Bauer over here.

06:15.778 --> 06:17.439
Why not? See you Thursday.

06:17.474 --> 06:18.733
Thursday.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.947
That's what I do. I make connections.

06:25.988 --> 06:28.357
That's how we met, remember?

06:46.362 --> 06:48.491
Shirley, I believe you know my client.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.910
Why isn't this man in jail?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.288
He has an excellent attorney

06:51.288 --> 06:53.272
who filed an emergency writ
with the court of appeals,

06:53.272 --> 06:56.899
and the judge agreed the denial of bail
was an abuse of discretion.

06:56.899 --> 07:00.821
I'm surprised your lackey at the DA's office
didn't keep you abreast of this.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.259
Perhaps you didn't tip him enough.

07:02.259 --> 07:03.627
He's not to be in this building.

07:03.627 --> 07:06.270
I'll get a restraining order if I have to.

07:09.533 --> 07:10.994
She hates me.

07:11.035 --> 07:13.960
Tempers seem frayed all around.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.844
That's why I'm filing for a continuance.

07:19.051 --> 07:21.055
We'll let everyone cool down a bit,

07:21.055 --> 07:22.217
then try again for a plea bargain.

07:22.217 --> 07:22.991
No.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.390
A plea bargain's out of the question.

07:24.390 --> 07:25.764
It's not guilty or nothing.

07:25.764 --> 07:27.068
But you are guilty, Jerry.

07:27.068 --> 07:28.921
A whole office full of people saw you do it.

07:28.921 --> 07:30.526
One of the junior associates took

07:30.526 --> 07:32.060
a video of you on his cell phone.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.123
He's thinking of entering it
in a film festival.

07:34.123 --> 07:36.485
No plea bargain.

07:39.467 --> 07:41.220
Proving temporary insanity is

07:41.304 --> 07:42.974
a daunting task. You know that.

07:42.974 --> 07:44.644
A plea bargain is our best

07:44.728 --> 07:46.440
chance to keep you out of jail.

07:46.440 --> 07:51.617
If I plea bargain, I'll be disbarred.

07:51.658 --> 07:55.499
Alan, my whole life is the law.

07:55.541 --> 07:59.298
It's all I have. It's what I love.

07:59.340 --> 08:02.665
You can't let them take that away from me.

08:04.517 --> 08:05.850
Then we go to trial.

08:21.850 --> 08:24.734
Look up any case law, any articles, news reports,

08:24.775 --> 08:26.198
anything that supports the

08:26.198 --> 08:27.610
theory that stress in the workplace

08:27.610 --> 08:28.764
can lead to an individual

08:28.764 --> 08:29.850
losing control of themselves,

08:29.850 --> 08:32.374
especially in the form of a violent outburst.

08:32.374 --> 08:33.631
Got it.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.690
Hello, Garrett.

08:36.822 --> 08:40.263
You're not helping Mr Shore
on the Espenson case.

08:40.304 --> 08:41.899
Because you're a witness.

08:41.942 --> 08:44.963
I'm sure you're aware that would be
a conflict of interest.

08:44.963 --> 08:46.516
I was just getting him coffee.

08:46.516 --> 08:47.985
Well, you can't do that, either.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.412
I'll take a decaf, though. Thanks.

08:49.412 --> 08:50.354
Thank you.

08:50.838 --> 08:52.852
Shirley, I know we're fighting,

08:52.894 --> 08:55.706
but there's no reason
to take it out on the children.

08:55.706 --> 08:58.678
Alan, this looks like
it could be tough on you,

08:58.713 --> 09:02.133
especially since you don't have
an assistant anymore.

09:04.846 --> 09:06.766
Shirley fired you?

09:06.807 --> 09:09.389
Worse. I got transferred
to human resources

09:09.419 --> 09:12.233
where all the people persons are.

09:12.275 --> 09:14.236
She's building a Chinese wall.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.322
What's that?

09:15.405 --> 09:16.671
It's a legal concept.

09:16.706 --> 09:19.172
It keeps anyone in the firm
who may be involved

09:19.172 --> 09:21.081
in this case from talking to me about it.

09:21.081 --> 09:23.700
Well, then you've got
a big-ass wall around you.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.222
Shirley's just trying to rattle my cage.

09:26.908 --> 09:29.601
It's only a temporary transfer.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.596
So you won't be mad
if I ignore you in the hall

09:31.596 --> 09:33.909
and just look at your shoes?

09:33.944 --> 09:35.730
I need my job.

09:35.765 --> 09:38.738
I'll try to wear nice shoes.

09:48.085 --> 09:51.032
They call me at night
on the weekends.

09:51.067 --> 09:53.980
They e-mail, text-message my cell phone.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.516
They drop by for impromptu

09:56.599 --> 09:58.143
parent-teacher conferences.

09:58.143 --> 10:01.816
They challenge every grade,
every assignment.

10:01.858 --> 10:03.653
The last straw was when my

10:03.736 --> 10:05.447
sister was delivering her baby,

10:05.447 --> 10:07.283
and I was her coach.

10:07.325 --> 10:09.245
They called me on my cell phone.

10:09.245 --> 10:11.874
And when I said that Kathy
was starting to crown,

10:11.874 --> 10:13.878
they asked when she'd be finished.

10:13.878 --> 10:17.360
So we could discuss Rachel's paper
on “the red pony”.

10:17.592 --> 10:19.471
It used to be that teachers spent

10:19.471 --> 10:21.224
80% of the time with the students.

10:21.224 --> 10:24.020
Now we spend 80% of the time
with the parents,

10:24.062 --> 10:26.809
and it's hurting the kids.

10:27.108 --> 10:28.255
Thank you.

10:33.035 --> 10:35.617
Um, excuse me, your honor.
Just one moment.

10:36.666 --> 10:39.128
–Judge doesn't like her.
–She doesn't like me.

10:39.128 --> 10:41.633
You know who women
do find charming?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.719
–Me.
–Ms Bauer?

10:43.761 --> 10:45.806
Let me ask a question,
just see how it goes.

10:45.806 --> 10:47.434
–I don't know about that.
–Ms Bauer!

10:47.434 --> 10:49.479
Ms Carpenter, would you say that it's

10:49.479 --> 10:51.276
true that Rachel Gering
is a good student?

10:51.276 --> 10:52.943
Objection. Leading the witness.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.110
Right, sorry. I knew that.
Sorry. Right.

10:55.110 --> 10:57.754
What kind of grades does Rachel get?

10:57.789 --> 11:00.397
She has between a B+ and an A–average.

11:00.432 --> 11:02.298
And has the Gœrings' attention

11:02.333 --> 11:04.286
done anything to change that grade?

11:04.286 --> 11:06.169
–Not at all.
–One more question.

11:06.169 --> 11:08.793
Have the Gerings contacted
any other teachers?

11:08.793 --> 11:10.333
All the other teachers.

11:10.368 --> 11:12.026
The one they hounded the most

11:12.026 --> 11:13.783
was Mr Sheehy, the math teacher.

11:13.783 --> 11:15.434
–How'd he react?
–He quit.

11:15.469 --> 11:18.743
He couldn't take it anymore,
so he took early retirement.

11:18.743 --> 11:21.992
I'm still 20 years away from that.

11:22.075 --> 11:24.387
I was so excited to become a teacher.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.698
No one told me it would be this way.

11:27.751 --> 11:28.838
Nothing further, your honor,

11:28.838 --> 11:32.647
unless, uh, you can think of anything.

11:51.875 --> 11:53.837
I know what you want, Shirley.

11:53.878 --> 11:56.675
And, yes, Denny does
still talk about you.

11:56.717 --> 12:00.264
He remembers his experiences
with you so fondly.

12:00.305 --> 12:03.310
Did you know that he has
a position called “the Schmidt”?

12:03.310 --> 12:05.070
Would that be the one
where I read a magazine

12:05.070 --> 12:07.109
while he lies passed out on the floor?

12:07.109 --> 12:08.778
That's not what I heard.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.539
Look, Bev, I am a busy woman,

12:10.539 --> 12:12.146
so I'll just get to the point.

12:12.146 --> 12:14.367
Who are you and what are you up to?

12:14.402 --> 12:17.511
Oh, we're going to have that conversation.

12:17.546 --> 12:19.295
We are.

12:19.296 --> 12:20.720
So you think I'm screwing

12:20.720 --> 12:22.828
Denny for his money and power?

12:22.863 --> 12:26.927
–It had occurred to me.
–Well, good news. I am.

12:27.644 --> 12:31.297
I find money and power
just so appetizing.

12:31.332 --> 12:33.029
And why did you screw him?

12:33.064 --> 12:34.715
I lost a bet.

12:35.676 --> 12:39.664
Shirley, you know, I,
I thought you were enlightened,

12:40.473 --> 12:43.698
but it turns out you're
the worst kind of female there is.

12:43.698 --> 12:45.526
Either you condemn a woman as

12:45.561 --> 12:47.388
a whore because she enjoys sex.

12:47.388 --> 12:47.920
I didn't say that.

12:47.920 --> 12:51.042
Or you assume that she's
a manipulative gold digger.

12:52.525 --> 12:58.193
Oh, Bev, you know,
I've completely misread you.

12:58.277 --> 13:01.519
Here I had you pegged
as some kind of predatory shark.

13:02.155 --> 13:05.062
I came here today with the intention
of telling you that

13:05.062 --> 13:09.810
if you ever do anything to hurt
my friend Denny or this firm,

13:09.811 --> 13:13.763
I will see to it that you are hunted down
legally and literally

13:13.764 --> 13:17.656
until you are penniless
and left to troll airport bars

13:17.657 --> 13:22.009
looking for alcoholic pilots
nearing retirement age.

13:24.779 --> 13:29.204
But I can see I don't need to do that.

13:30.706 --> 13:32.083
You know,

13:32.125 --> 13:36.808
it's reay hard to believe that you're the one that came up with “the Schmidt”.

13:44.563 --> 13:49.616
So, uh, what is “the Schmidt”?

14:18.966 --> 14:19.959
May I cut in?

14:20.042 --> 14:21.813
I'm practicing for my wedding.

14:21.813 --> 14:22.866
Come on, join me.

14:23.476 --> 14:24.621
Why not?

14:26.704 --> 14:29.186
No, no, no, no, not on the one.
It's not a mambo.

14:29.186 --> 14:31.586
It's a feeling. Like a heartbeat.

14:31.628 --> 14:33.528
Ka-chung, ka-chung, ka-chung!

14:33.563 --> 14:35.445
Shut up and dance, mister.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.842
This case Shirley is pursuing against Jerry…

14:41.842 --> 14:43.429
I'm not allowed to talk about it.

14:43.429 --> 14:44.962
Vietnamese wall.

14:44.997 --> 14:46.495
Chinese wall.

14:46.646 --> 14:48.651
She's pressuring the DA's office.

14:48.692 --> 14:51.366
She's cut off all my resources here,
which is fine.

14:51.366 --> 14:52.661
It's just getting a little

14:52.661 --> 14:53.914
crowded around my hotel room

14:53.914 --> 14:56.461
with the two paralegals
I've hired from Harvard.

14:56.461 --> 14:59.336
Can't hear you over the wall.

15:01.975 --> 15:04.039
Hey, you're a natural.

15:04.230 --> 15:05.917
Anything Denny Crane can do, I can

15:05.917 --> 15:07.411
do backwards and wearing high heels.

15:07.411 --> 15:09.266
The feeling I get around here is

15:09.266 --> 15:11.369
that people aren't that hot on Bev.

15:11.790 --> 15:12.997
Haven't noticed.

15:13.335 --> 15:16.050
I don't care if nobody else likes her,

15:16.092 --> 15:18.055
but it's important to me
what you think of her.

15:18.055 --> 15:19.729
I imagine I'll like her.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.214
No, Alan, I need a guarantee.

15:21.214 --> 15:23.610
And I'm not talking about getting to

15:23.694 --> 15:25.189
know her and forming your own opinion.

15:25.189 --> 15:28.211
I need you to like her.

15:28.246 --> 15:30.027
Denny, just knowing you care

15:30.062 --> 15:31.865
for her makes me happy enough.

15:32.533 --> 15:34.111
I'm feeling your tension.

15:34.955 --> 15:36.774
You can't have a very strong case.

15:36.774 --> 15:39.222
Jerry Espenson was determined
to make partner.

15:39.222 --> 15:40.721
He didn't, and that's what made him snap.

15:40.721 --> 15:42.975
Well, what's so special about that?

15:43.323 --> 15:45.649
All the associates want to make partner.

15:45.649 --> 15:48.565
It's the carrot we dangle in

15:48.600 --> 15:51.426
front of them to keep them working.

15:52.794 --> 15:54.277
Excuse me, Denny.

15:58.445 --> 15:59.823
Melissa, I need your help.

15:59.823 --> 16:02.106
I need access to some personnel files.

16:02.997 --> 16:05.021
Vietnamese wall!

16:06.547 --> 16:09.425
Are you concerned about
Rachel's college prospects?

16:09.425 --> 16:10.232
Yes.

16:10.267 --> 16:11.977
Even the state schools have taken to

16:11.977 --> 16:13.564
admitting only the best of the best.

16:13.564 --> 16:15.152
Are you saying Ms Carpenter isn't

16:15.152 --> 16:16.655
qualified to prepare your daughter?

16:16.655 --> 16:18.660
No, but we would be remiss

16:18.744 --> 16:20.665
if we didn't stay so involved.

16:20.707 --> 16:22.712
Our most important job is to

16:22.795 --> 16:24.674
prepare Rachel for her future.

16:24.759 --> 16:26.201
Nothing further.

16:28.935 --> 16:31.107
Mrs Gœring, are you saying that

16:31.191 --> 16:33.363
Ms Carpenter is a bad teacher?

16:33.404 --> 16:34.741
No, I didn't say that.

16:34.783 --> 16:37.498
How would you rate her?
B–minus, C-plus, what?

16:37.498 --> 16:39.012
I don't think I could really…

16:39.012 --> 16:40.849
Because she has won a teaching award

16:40.849 --> 16:42.343
so maybe if you're not

16:42.426 --> 16:43.763
giving her a good enough grade,

16:43.763 --> 16:45.976
it's your problem, not hers.
Is that possible?

16:45.976 --> 16:46.711
I never said…

16:46.711 --> 16:48.829
We know that you're involved
with a lot of other teachers.

16:48.829 --> 16:50.913
We just don't want our teacher
to get lost in the shuffle.

16:50.913 --> 16:51.912
Maybe you were having a bad day

16:51.912 --> 16:52.878
when you evaluated her.

16:52.878 --> 16:53.723
Objection!

16:53.758 --> 16:54.720
I don't think you see her potential.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.272
We know you don't see how hard she works.

16:56.272 --> 16:58.758
She works so hard. The other teachers
are out playing. Traci's inside…

16:58.758 --> 16:59.801
–Your honor!
–Ms Bauer!

16:59.801 --> 17:01.341
Objection! They're badgering the witness!

17:01.341 --> 17:02.811
Of course we're badgering the witness.

17:02.811 --> 17:05.074
–You just figured that out?
–Objection sustained!

17:05.074 --> 17:06.025
Thank you, your honor,

17:06.025 --> 17:09.090
for sustaining the objection
to the badgeng of this woman.

17:09.090 --> 17:11.248
That's what this whole trial is about.

17:11.248 --> 17:13.710
Let's stop the badgering.

17:13.744 --> 17:17.230
No one should be able to do
that sort of thing to anybody.

17:18.334 --> 17:21.219
Unless they themselves are actually…

17:22.069 --> 17:23.535
a badger.

17:38.019 --> 17:40.859
In your opinion, did Mr Espenson
seem insane to you?

17:40.859 --> 17:41.192
No.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.072
He seemed to know exactly
what he was doing.

17:43.072 --> 17:44.433
He even negotiated for the

17:44.433 --> 17:46.656
services of Mr Shore as his attorney.

17:46.664 --> 17:49.922
He only agreed to spare my life
on that condition.

17:49.964 --> 17:52.331
Thank you. Nothing further.

17:55.978 --> 17:58.443
Uh, Ms Schmidt. Sorry, it's

17:58.526 --> 18:00.990
just these damn microphones.

18:01.032 --> 18:02.937
I don't know if you were able
to hear her clearly.

18:02.937 --> 18:05.401
I heard some of it, and it sounded great.

18:05.987 --> 18:08.550
Testing, one, two, three. Testing.

18:08.634 --> 18:10.764
Maybe if you sit a little closer.

18:10.847 --> 18:12.915
Mr Shore, we can all hear the witness
just fine.

18:12.915 --> 18:14.239
You can? Good.

18:14.274 --> 18:17.221
It's just Ms Schmidt and I work together,

18:17.257 --> 18:18.322
and around the office,

18:18.322 --> 18:19.505
Shirley's considered something…

18:19.505 --> 18:20.652
Mr Shore, do you have a question?

18:20.652 --> 18:21.306
I do.

18:21.341 --> 18:24.227
I have here Jerry Espenson's

18:24.263 --> 18:25.090
performance reviews for the past 15 years.

18:26.449 --> 18:28.965
Would you please read one for us?

18:29.006 --> 18:31.085
Pick a year, any year.

18:31.121 --> 18:32.981
For the record, Mr Espenson's

18:33.018 --> 18:34.879
work reviews are all excellent.

18:34.879 --> 18:36.111
Would you like me to read

18:36.111 --> 18:37.806
one aloud for dramatic effect?

18:37.806 --> 18:40.884
Now that you've taken
all the fun out of it, no.

18:40.918 --> 18:42.140
How about I do it?

18:44.044 --> 18:47.196
“Jerry has displayed
a vast knowledge of the law,”

18:47.230 --> 18:50.314
“delivered all assignments
in a timely fashion,”

18:50.348 --> 18:53.689
“has consistently met
with the firm's minimum billables”.

18:53.724 --> 18:57.137
There's no denying Mr Espenson's
exceptional work habits.

18:57.144 --> 18:59.078
Yes, and I quote,

18:59.113 --> 19:03.154
“Jerry Espenson is not partnership material”.

19:03.189 --> 19:04.710
What exactly did that mean?

19:04.710 --> 19:06.848
We're a private firm
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

19:06.848 --> 19:08.338
We have every right to decide what

19:08.338 --> 19:10.242
criteria by which to make people partners.

19:10.242 --> 19:12.948
Yes, but clearly,

19:12.983 --> 19:16.487
Jerry Espenson is not partnership material.

19:16.522 --> 19:19.935
I mean, look at him.
He's awkward, unsociable,

19:19.970 --> 19:23.349
keeps his hands
on his thighs at all times.

19:23.384 --> 19:25.227
As I said, we have many criteria.

19:25.227 --> 19:27.472
So you've been lying to Jerry.
Is that it?

19:27.472 --> 19:28.737
I beg your pardon?

19:28.771 --> 19:30.388
About his chances to make partner.

19:30.388 --> 19:31.819
You never told him that he

19:31.819 --> 19:33.182
wasn't partnership material.

19:33.182 --> 19:35.263
Quite the contrary, you encouraged him

19:35.263 --> 19:37.867
again and again to aspire to that position.

19:37.902 --> 19:41.482
And yet, there it was,
“not partnership material,”

19:41.517 --> 19:45.063
in his confidential file
since 1990, 15 years ago.

19:45.098 --> 19:46.840
You've been lying to Jerry

19:46.875 --> 19:48.785
Espenson for 15 years, haven't you?

19:48.785 --> 19:50.715
As you know, Mr Shore, not everyone

19:50.715 --> 19:52.575
makes partner at our firm or any other.

19:52.575 --> 19:55.040
Otherwise our letterhead
would be 20 pages long.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.088
But as an institutionalized practice,

19:57.088 --> 19:58.866
you keep all associates believing

19:58.866 --> 20:01.069
they have a chance to make partner,

20:01.104 --> 20:03.271
especially the exceptional ones,

20:03.306 --> 20:05.061
even if you never have any

20:05.096 --> 20:07.738
intention of doing so. Isn't that right?

20:07.772 --> 20:12.315
We encourage all our attorneys
to do good work. It's their job.

20:16.072 --> 20:21.875
That incident in the conference room
a week ago with the cake knife…

20:23.244 --> 20:27.881
that really rattled you, didn't it?

20:29.013 --> 20:33.096
–Excuse me?
–A man held a knife to your throat.

20:33.131 --> 20:37.180
You perceived it as a grave threat.
It rattled you.

20:40.512 --> 20:45.615
The experience was not a pleasant one.

20:45.713 --> 20:49.071
No, I'm sure it wasn't.

20:52.290 --> 20:55.703
But let's talk about what's
really going on here, shall we?

20:55.703 --> 20:58.117
A gifted, eccentric and loyal

20:58.152 --> 21:01.739
employee who worked
for 15 years on a promise

21:01.780 --> 21:04.777
momentarily lost control of his senses

21:04.812 --> 21:07.774
when his one dream was taken away.

21:07.816 --> 21:10.697
And yet the DA's office
has charged my client

21:10.732 --> 21:13.310
with everything short
of the Lindbergh kidnapping.

21:13.310 --> 21:15.905
Because ultimately
they're just following orders

21:15.905 --> 21:18.472
from the great and powerful Schmidt,
aren't they?

21:18.472 --> 21:21.053
–Objection. Relevance?
–Sustained. Mr Shore…

21:21.053 --> 21:23.279
Did someone move for a mistrial?
Because I'm fine with that.

21:23.279 --> 21:26.922
You will keep your questions relevant, Mr Shore.

21:27.005 --> 21:28.300
Nothing further.

21:31.167 --> 21:33.047
When Mr Espenson was denied

21:33.082 --> 21:36.080
partnership with the firm, was he fired?

21:36.120 --> 21:38.285
No, he was offered a position

21:38.369 --> 21:40.450
of counsel and was free to stay.

21:40.492 --> 21:42.429
And what salary would Mr Espenson

21:42.429 --> 21:44.644
have made if he'd stayed at the firm?

21:45.819 --> 21:49.748
Approximately $300,000 per year.

21:50.066 --> 21:53.603
$300,000 a year?

21:53.644 --> 21:55.554
Sounds like a real coal mine

21:55.589 --> 21:57.262
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

22:17.819 --> 22:20.167
It's not going very well, is it?

22:21.394 --> 22:23.341
No, it's not.

22:23.456 --> 22:25.851
Jerry, it may be time to start thinking

22:25.886 --> 22:28.246
of who will take care of Linda if…

22:28.504 --> 22:29.534
You're away.

22:29.570 --> 22:32.336
Oh, God! Oh, God!

22:35.152 --> 22:36.707
Jerry, I'm going to make a

22:36.732 --> 22:38.229
case for temporary insanity

22:38.229 --> 22:41.016
that is as compelling
as it can possibly be,

22:41.057 --> 22:43.553
but it's thin at best.

22:43.595 --> 22:46.588
And I must be frank with you.

22:46.630 --> 22:49.056
I don't know if it will be enough.

22:50.207 --> 22:53.929
My dad is a mathematics professor
at Cornell,

22:53.964 --> 22:57.650
and he's always saying,
“may I have some toast?”

22:58.733 --> 23:00.147
I don't understand.

23:00.231 --> 23:02.352
He says it over and over again,

23:02.394 --> 23:06.178
“May I have some toast?
May I have some toast?”

23:06.220 --> 23:09.006
And eventually he says it enough,

23:09.048 --> 23:11.794
and someone always gives him toast.

23:11.835 --> 23:12.692
Your father?

23:12.727 --> 23:15.240
He never gives up. That's what I'm saying.

23:15.245 --> 23:17.724
It's the toast. Bingo.

23:17.759 --> 23:20.204
We should never give up.

23:22.191 --> 23:23.867
No, we won't give up, Jerry.

23:33.753 --> 23:36.582
I felt like a cross
between Clarence Darrow.

23:36.623 --> 23:40.449
And, uh, Al Pacino
in that movie where he shouts.

23:40.491 --> 23:42.321
You are really good at trial law.

23:42.321 --> 23:44.941
You should, um…

23:44.983 --> 23:47.603
Maybe next life.

23:47.645 --> 23:50.126
Anyway, enough about me.
Let's talk about you.

23:50.126 --> 23:55.256
Why are you getting involved
with a dead guy?

23:55.297 --> 23:58.250
I, uh, try not to think about it.

23:58.292 --> 24:02.866
I do find myself being
strangely forthcoming with you.

24:02.867 --> 24:06.712
Oh, so you're my count Guido.

24:06.747 --> 24:08.898
Who?

24:08.981 --> 24:11.310
Count Guido da Montefeltro.

24:11.393 --> 24:13.182
Uh, from Dante's “inferno”.

24:13.265 --> 24:14.687
Dante meets Guido in hell.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.295
Guido tells him that if he thought his

24:16.295 --> 24:17.835
words would ever reach the real world,

24:17.835 --> 24:20.502
he'd never reveal his true feelings to anyone.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.942
But because he thinks Dante's dead,

24:21.942 --> 24:23.972
he tells him everything.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.532
So you think I'm honest with you

24:26.567 --> 24:28.864
because you're, um, a dead guy?

24:30.511 --> 24:31.708
Something like that.

24:32.739 --> 24:37.596
So, Guido, can I do the closing?

24:42.462 --> 24:44.042
It's called Asperger's syndrome.

24:44.042 --> 24:46.376
And as you suspected, it is hereditary.

24:46.413 --> 24:48.565
Asperger's syndrome?

24:49.574 --> 24:52.444
Sounds like something
you cure with an ointment.

24:52.444 --> 24:54.482
It's a form of autism.

24:54.523 --> 24:56.728
From the behavior
that you've described

24:56.728 --> 24:59.972
and from what I read
in his, uh, personnel file…

25:00.014 --> 25:02.924
Oh, dear, how ever
did you get hold of that?

25:02.966 --> 25:06.044
Jerry Espenson is a classic case.

25:06.086 --> 25:09.496
No eye contact,
strange tic-like behaviors,

25:09.538 --> 25:11.950
passion for a single subject,
in this case, the law.

25:11.950 --> 25:13.447
Sudden outbursts.

25:13.489 --> 25:15.402
Basically their brains can't process

25:15.402 --> 25:17.315
ordinary nonverbal cues that

25:17.399 --> 25:19.254
most people use to communicate.

25:19.270 --> 25:21.191
I know it sounds strange.

25:21.226 --> 25:23.112
I'm not one to judge.

25:23.845 --> 25:26.299
Do you think Jerry Espenson
knows he has it?

25:26.299 --> 25:28.836
I doubt it. Most adults don't know.

25:28.878 --> 25:32.953
It wasn't even considered
a disorder until 1995.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.639
Denny.

25:47.781 --> 25:48.748
What's this?

25:48.783 --> 25:52.065
It's your prenup from your last marriage.

25:57.715 --> 26:00.095
It's hard to believe
I was ever that young.

26:00.095 --> 26:02.471
I took the liberty of drawing

26:02.506 --> 26:04.847
up a new one with some addendums.

26:09.430 --> 26:10.753
“In the event that either party

26:10.753 --> 26:13.015
becomes physically
or mentally incapacitated,

26:13.015 --> 26:14.832
their assets…”

26:15.724 --> 26:16.950
This isn't about protecting me.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.140
This is about protecting the firm.

26:18.140 --> 26:19.911
You've been through wives

26:19.946 --> 26:21.625
before, Denny, five of them.

26:21.650 --> 26:23.249
This firm is the constant.

26:23.284 --> 26:24.888
We're the ones who are still here,

26:24.888 --> 26:28.139
and this does look after
your best interests.

26:28.174 --> 26:30.098
You mean the best interests
of the firm.

26:30.098 --> 26:31.652
Oh, for God's sake, Denny.

26:31.652 --> 26:32.999
Someone has to worry about this

26:32.999 --> 26:34.792
firm, and since you won't, I have to.

26:34.792 --> 26:36.640
Because you're a senior partner,

26:36.640 --> 26:38.765
yet your name isn't on the door.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.854
Mine is. First name on the door.

26:40.889 --> 26:43.829
I'm not interested in getting into
an historical argument with you.

26:43.829 --> 26:46.534
Why, because I built this firm
from the ground up?

26:46.534 --> 26:49.204
I care about what could happen
to this firm now!

26:49.204 --> 26:51.367
Let me tell you what'll happen
to this firm if Denny Crane left.

26:51.367 --> 26:54.125
It would dry up and blow away
and you with it!

26:55.019 --> 26:57.775
I'm the big gun on this boat, the captain!

26:58.010 --> 27:02.757
And you're nothing but a skinny,
overpaid deckhand!

27:02.792 --> 27:05.607
No, I am the deckhand
who steers the ship,

27:05.642 --> 27:08.368
because the captain
isn't up to it anymore!

27:08.403 --> 27:09.553
Get out.

27:10.256 --> 27:14.061
Look over the new document,
sign it and get it back to me today.

27:14.061 --> 27:15.906
I'm not signing anything.

27:24.457 --> 27:26.014
I can't believe we're here today

27:26.014 --> 27:29.252
because these parents
care too much about their child.

27:29.713 --> 27:31.436
The truth is our children are growing up

27:31.436 --> 27:33.124
in a frighteningly competitive world.

27:33.124 --> 27:34.570
They'll face global competition the

27:34.570 --> 27:35.982
likes of which we've never seen before,

27:35.982 --> 27:38.048
and we are unprepared.

27:38.083 --> 27:40.033
The most recent study
ranked American students

27:40.033 --> 27:41.749
16th in the world in science,

27:41.749 --> 27:43.430
19th in the world in mathematics.

27:43.430 --> 27:44.681
Of American 12th graders,

27:44.681 --> 27:49.419
30% of the boys and 17% of the girls
cannot read at the basic level.

27:49.454 --> 27:51.226
This type of failure will kill our kids,

27:51.226 --> 27:53.684
and that's what George and Gigi Gœring
are trying to prevent.

27:53.684 --> 27:55.625
These parents are simply trying to secure

27:55.625 --> 27:57.531
their daughter's future as best they can,

27:57.531 --> 27:59.372
a future that they know will be

27:59.372 --> 28:01.606
challenged with ever-increasing competition.

28:01.606 --> 28:03.950
What I would have given to have

28:03.985 --> 28:06.294
parents as involved as the Gœrings.

28:06.694 --> 28:10.472
If you ask me, their daughter's lucky
her parents care so much.

28:17.475 --> 28:19.726
Before I start, um,

28:19.768 --> 28:22.892
I know you think your parents
weren't involved, but look at you.

28:22.892 --> 28:25.128
I think you turned out super.

28:25.957 --> 28:28.104
By the way, your honor,
I'm, uh, I'm dying.

28:28.104 --> 28:29.813
–I object!
–You object.

28:29.854 --> 28:31.764
He's trying to garner sympathy,
your honor.

28:31.764 --> 28:32.855
Not at all, your honor.

28:32.855 --> 28:34.743
I only mean to say that my current

28:34.743 --> 28:37.234
situation gives me a unique view on life.

28:37.816 --> 28:41.526
Sustained. Mr Post,
proceed with your closing.

28:41.609 --> 28:43.859
Right. Moving on.

28:43.943 --> 28:46.125
The Gœrings want to be involved
in their child's education,

28:46.125 --> 28:47.575
and they should be.

28:47.610 --> 28:52.928
But in their zealotry, they left one thing
out of the equation.

28:53.338 --> 28:54.500
The teacher.

28:54.535 --> 28:58.332
Because let's face it, your honor,
we treat our teachers like crap.

28:58.332 --> 29:00.907
Instead of training
our educators properly

29:00.990 --> 29:03.427
and believing in them
and incentivizing them with

29:03.427 --> 29:05.194
decent wages, we disrespect them,

29:05.194 --> 29:06.890
we challenge them at every turn.

29:06.890 --> 29:08.528
And the government, in their no child

29:08.528 --> 29:10.096
left behind act, have created a monster.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.231
Instead of teaching children to be innovative,

29:12.231 --> 29:14.331
our educators are forced to cheat to the test.

29:14.331 --> 29:16.336
And it's been documented at nationwide,

29:16.336 --> 29:18.180
some teachers are themselves
cheating on those tests,

29:18.180 --> 29:20.237
because their salaries, their bonuses,

29:20.237 --> 29:23.652
their job security are linked
to the test scores.

29:34.835 --> 29:36.776
Sit down, sit down.

29:38.879 --> 29:41.145
And on the other side
we have parents like the Gœrings

29:41.145 --> 29:44.731
coming at them from all angles,
questioning their every move,

29:44.731 --> 29:47.223
instead of putting their faith in them.

29:47.257 --> 29:48.591
But they do it from a good place.

29:48.591 --> 29:51.709
I mean, all they want is
complete and utter control.

29:54.384 --> 29:55.742
And believe me, I know all

29:55.742 --> 29:57.218
about wanting control of your life

29:57.218 --> 29:59.594
and having very little of it.

29:59.886 --> 30:01.685
But you can't control life.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.199
You can't control your daughter.

30:03.199 --> 30:04.608
You can't control the teacher.

30:04.608 --> 30:07.563
All you can do is inspire them
to be innovative thinkers,

30:07.563 --> 30:12.131
people who tap into their own creativity
and competence to try new things,

30:12.165 --> 30:15.111
to challenge the status quo,
to make new discoveries.

30:15.111 --> 30:17.500
And our kids will do all that and more

30:17.535 --> 30:19.891
if we just back off and let them grow.

30:26.270 --> 30:30.887
Just my luck, one of the little bastards
will come up with a cure for cancer.

30:43.526 --> 30:45.249
They say Albert Einstein may

30:45.284 --> 30:47.023
have had Asperger's syndrome.

30:47.820 --> 30:50.237
Thomas Jefferson.

30:50.279 --> 30:53.844
Some say even Bill Gates
exhibits certain signs of it.

30:54.072 --> 30:56.457
Very good company.

31:00.116 --> 31:01.423
Jerry?

31:04.826 --> 31:07.170
It's a relief, actually.

31:07.205 --> 31:08.304
You think?

31:08.910 --> 31:11.954
I always hated that
I couldn't be normal.

31:12.953 --> 31:17.220
Turns out… it's because I'm not.

31:19.762 --> 31:22.812
Jerry, it's also a viable defense.

31:22.847 --> 31:25.091
We just need the psychiatrist
to give you a diagnosis.

31:25.091 --> 31:26.314
Oh, no, no, no, no.

31:26.349 --> 31:27.879
Jerry, without a clinical diagnosis…

31:27.879 --> 31:31.186
With a diagnosis in court,
it'll be a matter of public record.

31:31.186 --> 31:33.390
I will be the autistic lawyer.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.989
Forget about disbarment!

31:35.024 --> 31:37.308
No one will ever hire a mental case!

31:37.343 --> 31:38.400
Jerry, listen to me…

31:38.400 --> 31:40.277
No, then I certainly could
never be a lawyer again.

31:40.277 --> 31:42.821
No, no, no, no!

31:52.175 --> 31:54.510
After carefully reviewing the testimony,

31:54.510 --> 31:59.136
as well as my own conduct
as a parent of a teenager,

31:59.178 --> 32:02.012
I am ruling in favor of the plaintiff.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.638
–Yes!
–Mr Post, control yourself.

32:04.679 --> 32:07.264
Sorry, your honor. Sorry, everybody.

32:07.305 --> 32:09.056
Mr and Mrs Gring,

32:09.098 --> 32:11.516
it is plainly evident that
you love your daughter,

32:11.516 --> 32:13.218
but your interest in her studies

32:13.218 --> 32:16.767
has, in my view, become interference.

32:16.809 --> 32:18.864
Therefore, I am granting the

32:18.899 --> 32:22.061
petitioner's request for injunctive relief.

32:22.102 --> 32:25.040
You may call Ms Carpenter
once every three weeks,

32:25.103 --> 32:28.559
and you can have one parent-teacher
conference per term.

32:29.022 --> 32:30.590
We're adjourned.

32:32.689 --> 32:36.857
–Thank you both so much.
–You're welcome.

32:36.899 --> 32:38.441
Thank you.

32:38.483 --> 32:41.276
–Nice work, counselor.
–Yeah. Oh, nuts!

32:41.318 --> 32:42.946
You know, I didn't get a chance
to ask the court reporter

32:42.946 --> 32:44.292
to read back someone's testimony.

32:44.292 --> 32:45.954
That would have been awesome.

32:45.954 --> 32:48.747
Do you want to go, um, celebrate?

32:49.451 --> 32:51.849
You know what? I'll be out in a minute.

32:51.884 --> 32:54.247
I just want to, um, savor the moment.

32:55.509 --> 32:56.853
Okay.

33:35.077 --> 33:36.932
–Asperger's syndrome.
–What?

33:36.974 --> 33:38.747
I wasn't familiar with it either,

33:38.747 --> 33:40.586
but these three highly regarded

33:40.602 --> 33:42.417
psychiatrists have heard of it,

33:42.417 --> 33:45.798
and they're all convinced
Jerry Espenson suffers from it.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.229
It doesn't change anything.

33:47.229 --> 33:48.592
It actually changes a lot.

33:48.592 --> 33:51.636
According to the
Americans with disabilities act,

33:51.678 --> 33:53.492
it changes Jerry Espenson from

33:53.527 --> 33:55.090
an oddball who attacked his boss

33:55.090 --> 33:57.013
to a man who has suffered his whole

33:57.013 --> 33:58.866
life from a form of behavioral autism.

33:58.866 --> 34:03.033
It also changes your case
from a winner to a loser.

34:04.900 --> 34:06.014
What are you looking for?

34:06.014 --> 34:07.118
Dismiss the charges.

34:07.118 --> 34:08.002
No.

34:08.036 --> 34:10.210
There's no reason to prosecute this man.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.458
Shirley, you must have something
to say about this.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.699
I do.

34:13.783 --> 34:16.917
I'm sorry Jerry has autism.
It explains a lot.

34:16.952 --> 34:20.052
But what's to stop him
from doing it again,

34:20.087 --> 34:23.126
from attacking someone else or worse?

34:23.168 --> 34:25.280
Because he wants to get better.

34:27.004 --> 34:28.547
There's medications that can

34:28.547 --> 34:29.965
help control his outbursts,

34:29.965 --> 34:31.341
behavioral therapy to

34:31.425 --> 34:32.842
rehabilitate his social skills,

34:32.842 --> 34:35.606
occupational therapy for his tics.

34:35.641 --> 34:38.370
It's what's fair and what's right.

34:40.766 --> 34:43.431
Would you excuse us, please?

35:02.413 --> 35:04.248
Shirley, in the time that I've known you,

35:04.248 --> 35:07.027
I've never seen you do
what you're doing now.

35:08.419 --> 35:09.928
You said to me at the outset

35:09.928 --> 35:11.403
you were looking for justice.

35:11.403 --> 35:12.988
Jerry Espenson has been

35:13.023 --> 35:17.052
suffering needlessly his entire life.

35:17.094 --> 35:19.680
Now he has a chance
to find a measure of peace.

35:19.680 --> 35:23.273
That's justice, Shirley, isn't it?

35:29.606 --> 35:31.400
You'll get him help?

35:31.442 --> 35:33.414
My word.

35:44.579 --> 35:45.884
It's over?

35:47.248 --> 35:48.813
It is.

35:50.751 --> 35:54.589
Jerry, it's best you leave now.

35:54.630 --> 35:58.102
Shirley's largesse will only go so far.

36:02.722 --> 36:05.948
I just, I want to, um…

36:07.935 --> 36:10.328
Good-bye, Alan.

36:25.326 --> 36:26.870
So Guido?

36:26.911 --> 36:28.997
Who do you see playing me
in the movie?

36:28.997 --> 36:30.290
I'm thinking Denzel.

36:30.331 --> 36:31.749
I don't think this case was

36:31.749 --> 36:33.084
the stuff Oscars are made of.

36:33.084 --> 36:34.690
To me it was.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.296
I don't get it.

36:36.337 --> 36:37.880
You've built a

36:37.964 --> 36:39.716
billion-dollar company
from the ground up.

36:39.716 --> 36:42.385
Why does this excite you?

36:42.468 --> 36:44.220
I don't know.

36:44.304 --> 36:46.222
Having stocks, futures, it's

36:46.305 --> 36:48.141
sort of a fantasy, you know?

36:48.224 --> 36:50.601
You can't really see it.

36:50.685 --> 36:54.261
But a courtroom, a judge,
someone who needs my help,

36:54.296 --> 36:58.900
that I can see, smell, hear, touch, taste.

36:58.984 --> 37:03.155
It's four stars, five senses.

37:03.238 --> 37:05.157
I was really good in there, wasn't I?

37:05.157 --> 37:11.079
I imagine you'd be pretty good
at anything you try.

37:16.626 --> 37:20.630
I start chemo again tomorrow.

37:21.923 --> 37:23.133
Okay.

38:29.863 --> 38:31.368
Good evening.

38:36.203 --> 38:39.005
You hate me, too, don't you?

38:39.248 --> 38:41.834
Bev, I don't know you
well enough to hate you

38:41.834 --> 38:44.810
or love you or be indifferent to you.

38:46.212 --> 38:49.396
Denny said you spoke your mind,
but jeez Louise.

38:52.051 --> 38:54.053
I will say the fact that

38:54.088 --> 38:56.423
everyone else at this firm does not have

38:56.423 --> 38:58.925
a favorable opinion of you is

38:58.960 --> 39:01.427
certainly a point in your favor.

39:20.037 --> 39:22.518
–Paul.
–Denny.

39:23.873 --> 39:25.667
I've got a pair of Celtic

39:25.750 --> 39:27.502
tickets for tomorrow night,

39:27.544 --> 39:30.380
if you're interested.

39:33.007 --> 39:34.798
Thanks.

39:36.094 --> 39:38.846
–Denny.
–Yeah?

39:38.888 --> 39:42.141
Well, I'm just surprised

39:42.225 --> 39:44.199
after our argument.

39:44.695 --> 39:45.519
Argument?

39:45.520 --> 39:47.563
Denny, it was just yesterday.

39:47.605 --> 39:50.191
Paul, I would remember
if we had a fight.

39:50.233 --> 39:52.735
We almost came to blows.
How could you not…

39:52.735 --> 39:54.904
Paul, would you rather rehash all that,

39:54.904 --> 39:56.948
or should we just pretend that I forgot?

39:56.948 --> 40:00.992
If you'll forgive me. I left Bev on simmer.

40:01.034 --> 40:03.974
She should be coming
to a boil rather nicely now.

40:15.257 --> 40:17.050
Hey.

40:17.092 --> 40:19.594
My favorite girl, my favorite guy.

40:19.636 --> 40:22.097
I warmed up your cigar for you.

40:22.138 --> 40:23.765
Well, it's not the first

40:23.848 --> 40:25.392
time you left my stogie smoking.

40:25.392 --> 40:26.888
Well, I'm gonna let you

40:26.923 --> 40:28.603
two young men have your time,

40:28.603 --> 40:30.654
and I ll see you later.

40:31.231 --> 40:32.857
–Bev?
–Yeah?

40:32.899 --> 40:35.443
Do it once before you leave.

40:35.485 --> 40:39.433
–Bev Crane.
–Oh, that's my girl.

40:39.613 --> 40:41.274
Good night, Alan.

40:41.309 --> 40:42.936
Good evening, Bev.

40:48.872 --> 40:50.624
So…

40:50.666 --> 40:53.046
do you like her yet? You promised.

40:53.081 --> 40:54.414
I did, and I do.

40:54.449 --> 40:55.748
I thought you would.

40:57.005 --> 40:58.685
She has many fine qualities.

40:58.715 --> 41:00.041
She makes my friend smile.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.261
That's the only quality that matters.

41:02.552 --> 41:04.721
Alan,

41:05.263 --> 41:08.565
Bev is the woman I've always dreamed of.

41:10.560 --> 41:13.938
An angel in the bedroom,
a whore in the kitchen.

41:13.979 --> 41:16.019
I think it's the other way around.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.078
Not last night.

41:20.305 --> 41:26.825
