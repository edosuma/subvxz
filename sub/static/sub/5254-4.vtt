WEBVTT

00:00.068 --> 00:01.265
Previously on Faking It...

00:01.289 --> 00:02.817
Liam's really into this protest.

00:02.843 --> 00:05.041
You'll each be getting
new Skwerkel smartphones

00:05.043 --> 00:06.242
and tablets.

00:06.244 --> 00:07.410
She's just trying to buy us.

00:07.412 --> 00:08.962
The woman from Skwerkel...

00:08.964 --> 00:10.880
She's my sister.

00:10.882 --> 00:11.998
And I slept with Amy.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.333
Oh, my God.

00:13.335 --> 00:15.960
- I have to tell Karma.
- Just loosen up a bit,

00:15.986 --> 00:17.736
and I bet you're even
prettier when you smile.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.166
_

00:26.013 --> 00:27.846
Walk quickly before the
guards see us escaping

00:27.848 --> 00:29.431
- and lock the gates.
- Did you hear,

00:29.433 --> 00:31.233
there's an open spot in the drama club.

00:31.235 --> 00:33.018
Kate Brown got a Blemclear commercial,

00:33.020 --> 00:35.187
got an agent, and moved
to L.A. for pilot season.

00:35.189 --> 00:36.355
Can you imagine?

00:36.357 --> 00:38.106
My face covered in pimples

00:38.108 --> 00:39.942
splashed across my HDTV?

00:39.944 --> 00:41.827
- No, thank you.
- Hester's drama club

00:41.829 --> 00:43.695
is the best in the state,
and they're holding auditions

00:43.697 --> 00:45.364
this afternoon, and I'm going to audition.

00:45.366 --> 00:46.698
Is that crazy?

00:46.700 --> 00:48.750
Well, they are a bunch of elitist,

00:48.752 --> 00:50.836
stuck on themselves ass...

00:51.437 --> 00:54.957
If by crazy you mean brilliant.

00:54.959 --> 00:56.925
Since our break-up, we're invisible again.

00:56.927 --> 00:58.343
This is my chance to get back on the map,

00:58.345 --> 01:00.546
and this time for my talent,

01:00.548 --> 01:02.548
not my fake sexual orientation.

01:02.550 --> 01:03.632
Yeah, you can't really put that

01:03.634 --> 01:05.016
on your college applications.

01:05.019 --> 01:07.886
Question is: Do you think I have talent?

01:07.888 --> 01:10.639
You performed that song in
front of the whole school

01:10.641 --> 01:12.057
when we had that stupid protest.

01:12.059 --> 01:13.642
People loved you, they
covered it on YouTube.

01:13.644 --> 01:15.360
They're looking for triple threats.

01:15.362 --> 01:17.529
Triple threat? You are a quadruple threat.

01:17.531 --> 01:20.065
You can belch all the
letters of the alphabet.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.817
Amy.

01:21.819 --> 01:24.069
Karma was just saying she's
auditioning for drama club.

01:24.071 --> 01:25.654
You are.

01:25.656 --> 01:27.406
I'll see you there. Too
bad there can only be

01:27.408 --> 01:29.908
one singular sensation. I
need to talk to you right now.

01:29.910 --> 01:31.243
What is it?

01:32.963 --> 01:34.713
It's okay. I was just leaving.

01:34.715 --> 01:37.049
Play nice. Don't let things get weird

01:37.051 --> 01:38.584
- at those auditions.
- I didn't come here to talk

01:38.586 --> 01:40.836
about drama. I came
here to talk about drama.

01:40.838 --> 01:44.389
Liam told me you two slept together.

01:44.391 --> 01:45.891
Yeah, my face exactly.

01:45.893 --> 01:47.426
Oh.

01:47.428 --> 01:49.428
Shane, that was the
hugest mistake of my life.

01:49.430 --> 01:50.979
I can barely stand thinking about it.

01:50.981 --> 01:52.731
What, having sex with a
guy? So you didn't enjoy it?

01:52.733 --> 01:54.066
Or did you? Are you bi now?

01:54.068 --> 01:56.401
- What does it all mean?
- Oh, what it means

01:56.403 --> 01:58.353
that I did the most horrible thing

01:58.355 --> 02:00.239
- a best friend could do.
- You made a mistake.

02:00.241 --> 02:01.940
But don't forget, it
was Karma's lie that set

02:01.942 --> 02:04.776
- this crazy train in motion.
- I grabbed a knife

02:04.778 --> 02:06.495
and I plunged it deep into her heart.

02:06.497 --> 02:08.080
- Me.
- I liked it better

02:08.082 --> 02:11.333
- when it was her fault.
- She can never know.

02:11.335 --> 02:13.035
And I can't believe he told you.

02:13.037 --> 02:15.003
Trust me, telling me was
the least of your problems.

02:15.005 --> 02:18.790
Liam is so filled with guilt,
he's about to tell Karma.

02:18.792 --> 02:20.208
Where is he?

02:20.210 --> 02:21.176
He stayed home today.

02:21.178 --> 02:22.461
Then where is that?

02:22.463 --> 02:26.048
I don't know. Really, I have no clue.

02:26.050 --> 02:28.634
He is your best friend and
you don't know where he lives?

02:28.636 --> 02:30.969
Liam is very private about his family.

02:30.971 --> 02:32.354
I've only been to his house like once.

02:32.356 --> 02:37.359
So you do know.

02:37.361 --> 02:39.311
I'm so bad at secrets.

02:39.336 --> 02:40.313
Synced and corrected by Chitorafa
www.addic7ed.com

02:42.082 --> 02:43.949
Amy, no, no, no. You can't be here.

02:43.951 --> 02:45.817
- You have to go.
- You want to tell Karma?

02:45.819 --> 02:47.235
Well, I'm here to either change your mind

02:47.237 --> 02:48.820
or pull out your tongue, you pick.

02:48.822 --> 02:50.706
The guilt is killing me. I
have to get this off my chest.

02:50.708 --> 02:52.240
If Karma finds out, it will kill her.

02:52.242 --> 02:54.126
I can't pretend that
that night never happened.

02:54.128 --> 02:55.744
- It's not your secret to tell.
- Well, maybe it isn't

02:55.746 --> 02:57.579
your secret to keep. Now please leave.

02:57.581 --> 02:58.997
- Not until you promise me...
- Liam, dear,

02:58.999 --> 03:01.500
will you please tell the
staff to decant the wine?

03:01.502 --> 03:04.219
Oh, hello.

03:04.221 --> 03:05.304
You have a friend.

03:05.306 --> 03:07.506
She's not my friend.

03:07.508 --> 03:09.591
No, I'm not.

03:09.593 --> 03:13.729
I was, but I'm his girlfriend.

03:13.731 --> 03:16.815
She's kidding.

03:16.817 --> 03:18.934
Uh, she has a mild case of Tourett's.

03:18.936 --> 03:21.486
Liam has this weird
hang-up on introducing me

03:21.488 --> 03:23.405
to his family. Are you guys assassins?

03:23.407 --> 03:25.324
Drug lords? Do you feed on blood?

03:25.326 --> 03:29.027
No, but I would if it
could cure my crow's feet.

03:31.031 --> 03:32.447
You should join us.

03:32.449 --> 03:33.782
Liam, please do as you were told

03:33.784 --> 03:35.701
while I get this lovely young woman

03:35.703 --> 03:38.003
into something more appropriate
for today's occasion.

03:38.005 --> 03:39.705
Come.

03:39.707 --> 03:41.873
Ooh, fun. Bye.

03:41.875 --> 03:46.211
Ooh-oh-ah-uh. Ooh-oh-ah-uh.

03:46.213 --> 03:48.880
Ooh-oh-ah-uh.

03:48.882 --> 03:50.215
You sound like a chimpanzee.

03:50.217 --> 03:51.933
Do not bother me when I am in the zone.

03:51.935 --> 03:53.185
Right, sorry.

03:53.187 --> 03:55.387
I forgot you treat
theater like a bloodsport.

03:55.389 --> 03:56.855
- Good luck.
- Good luck?

03:56.857 --> 03:58.223
That's bad luck. You're supposed to say

03:58.225 --> 03:59.558
"break a leg."

03:59.560 --> 04:00.809
Now why would anyone want to break

04:00.811 --> 04:03.362
- one of those lovely legs?
- Theo.

04:03.364 --> 04:06.198
- What's up, Shane?
- Remember as you paint sets,

04:06.200 --> 04:09.201
my skin tone pops more
against dark colors.

04:09.203 --> 04:10.736
Got it.

04:10.738 --> 04:13.622
Do I smell a showmance?

04:13.624 --> 04:16.375
Careful, new relationships can really

04:16.377 --> 04:18.577
wreck your concentration.

04:18.579 --> 04:19.911
There is no showmance.

04:19.913 --> 04:21.579
And the only wreck is going to be your ego

04:21.582 --> 04:24.049
when I get that spot.

04:24.051 --> 04:25.133
I'm so nervous.

04:25.135 --> 04:26.752
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

04:26.754 --> 04:27.850
And I don't think that they reward that

04:27.876 --> 04:30.881
in the scoring unless we're
playing someone bulimic.

04:32.009 --> 04:34.059
Oliver, right? I'm Karma.

04:34.061 --> 04:36.728
- I know who you are.
- Oh, okay.

04:36.730 --> 04:38.146
I was surprised to see you here.

04:38.148 --> 04:40.015
I mean, you don't seem
like much of a joiner.

04:40.017 --> 04:43.268
My therapist thinks I
should develop new interests.

04:43.270 --> 04:44.686
And I really shouldn't be talking to you,

04:44.688 --> 04:48.023
you're one of my triggers.

04:48.025 --> 04:50.659
I'm guessing you'll be
singing something original.

04:50.661 --> 04:52.360
I bet it will really give you an edge.

04:52.362 --> 04:55.280
You're just being nice to
me to try and get in my head.

04:55.282 --> 04:57.582
Can't I wish you well?

04:57.584 --> 05:00.952
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

05:04.541 --> 05:06.458
Applause.

05:06.460 --> 05:08.877
Two hands slapping together.

05:08.879 --> 05:12.130
The universal sign of a job well done.

05:12.132 --> 05:13.348
You all want it.

05:13.350 --> 05:15.050
You all crave it.

05:15.052 --> 05:20.472
But by the end of the day,
only one of you will earn it.

05:20.474 --> 05:21.973
My name is Margot.

05:21.975 --> 05:25.026
And in my six years as
producer, director, and curator

05:25.028 --> 05:27.145
of this great institution's
drama department,

05:27.147 --> 05:31.950
I have honed my ability to
spot diamonds in the rough.

05:31.952 --> 05:34.152
Just ask Connie Britton, who you may know

05:34.154 --> 05:35.737
from the hit series, Nashville.

05:38.158 --> 05:39.991
She's my aunt's friend's daughter.

05:39.993 --> 05:43.495
It is I who encouraged
her to go to Hollywood.

05:43.497 --> 05:46.081
I was nine.

05:46.083 --> 05:48.834
But diamonds like Connie are only formed

05:48.836 --> 05:50.919
under intense pressure,

05:50.921 --> 05:53.472
and I'm about to apply
that pressure to each

05:53.474 --> 05:55.090
and every one of you.

05:55.092 --> 05:58.009
I will push you to your physical,

05:58.011 --> 05:59.978
emotional, and spiritual limits.

05:59.980 --> 06:03.815
- Whoa, she's intense.
- Show business is intense.

06:03.817 --> 06:07.319
Especially when your only
credit is pretend lesbian.

06:07.321 --> 06:09.237
First up: Vocals.

06:09.239 --> 06:11.823
Did you all bring your sheet music?

06:11.825 --> 06:15.026
Good. Now tear it up.

06:15.028 --> 06:18.079
I've chosen the classic audition song,

06:18.081 --> 06:21.700
Tomorrow from the hit musical, Annie.

06:21.702 --> 06:24.786
That's what I was going to sing.

06:24.788 --> 06:26.538
Today my fiance James and I

06:26.540 --> 06:27.706
are celebrating our engagement.

06:27.708 --> 06:29.207
Congressman James Hewett?

06:29.209 --> 06:32.127
He's chairman of the energy
and commerce committee.

06:32.129 --> 06:34.596
We met when I was
testifying about Skwerkel's

06:34.598 --> 06:37.015
position on net neutrality.

06:37.017 --> 06:38.934
Oh, you're the Skwerkel lady.

06:38.936 --> 06:40.936
I thought you looked familiar.

06:40.938 --> 06:43.388
Yeah, you were there when our
school staged that protest...

06:43.390 --> 06:44.973
Ah-ah-ah.

06:44.975 --> 06:47.142
I never told father about
Liam's little revolution

06:47.144 --> 06:48.860
against the family business.

06:48.862 --> 06:52.230
I'm hoping I can count on your discretion.

06:52.232 --> 06:55.617
Yeah, of course.

06:55.619 --> 06:59.070
Wow, I can't believe Liam
Booker is the heir to Skwerkel.

06:59.072 --> 07:00.789
Well, he could be one day.

07:00.791 --> 07:02.824
But right now he wants no part of us

07:02.826 --> 07:04.409
or the family business.

07:04.411 --> 07:06.578
But I'm hoping that some
day soon he'll realize

07:06.580 --> 07:09.206
that family is all that matters.

07:11.718 --> 07:13.168

08:17.985 --> 08:21.152
Karma's the one to beat, people.

08:24.469 --> 08:25.801
You're a bartender now?

08:25.804 --> 08:28.355
I'm making my parents their Martinis.

08:28.357 --> 08:30.941
Dad feels a vigorous
shaking bruises the gin.

08:30.943 --> 08:32.775
Shrimp?

08:32.778 --> 08:35.861
Don't mind if I do. Mmm.

08:35.864 --> 08:38.782
You don't know anything about my life.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.900
You're right. And I don't care.

08:40.903 --> 08:42.652
Just promise me you won't tell Karma,

08:42.654 --> 08:44.621
and I will make a polite exit,

08:44.623 --> 08:46.289
and we never have to speak again.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.491
And if I don't?

08:47.493 --> 08:49.659
So how are those drinks coming?

08:49.661 --> 08:54.381
- Here.
- Thank you, son.

08:54.383 --> 08:57.417
Mm, you really are an artist.

08:57.419 --> 08:59.302
Hi. Who's this lovely young woman?

08:59.304 --> 09:00.887
Oh, I'm Amy.

09:00.889 --> 09:02.506
I'm Liam's girlfriend,

09:02.508 --> 09:06.176
and I'm pregnant.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.145
Oh, I'm just kidding.

09:09.147 --> 09:11.932
It's just a little in-law
humor to break the ice.

09:11.934 --> 09:13.316
Did you two kids meet at school?

09:13.318 --> 09:14.434
We met at a school protest.

09:14.436 --> 09:15.769
What kind of protest?

09:15.771 --> 09:18.021
Honey, can I steal you away

09:18.023 --> 09:19.356
for a sec?

09:19.358 --> 09:21.107
Okay, okay, you win.

09:21.109 --> 09:23.443
- I need to hear you say it.
- Say what?

09:23.445 --> 09:26.947
"I promise I won't tell
Karma we slept together."

09:26.949 --> 09:30.083
I promise I'll let you out at some point.

09:30.085 --> 09:31.368
Hey!

09:31.370 --> 09:34.704
Kudos, everyone, for surviving round one.

09:34.706 --> 09:37.424
Round two is all about movement.

09:37.426 --> 09:39.459
Now partner up.

09:39.461 --> 09:42.128
And dance. Dance!

09:45.601 --> 09:48.552
Let your bodies speak to each other.

09:48.554 --> 09:52.188
Tell me a story.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.557
That's it.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:03.569 --> 10:04.734
Please don't do that.

10:04.736 --> 10:06.319
Commit to the moment.

10:10.208 --> 10:14.411
Yes. Yes.

10:14.413 --> 10:17.163
Yes.

10:24.423 --> 10:26.723
Yes.

10:26.725 --> 10:29.509
Color me impressed.

10:29.511 --> 10:31.428
Lauren and Shane.

10:31.430 --> 10:34.764
Being a strong partner is a hallmark

10:34.766 --> 10:37.227
of any great performer.

10:39.241 --> 10:40.240
Hmm.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.607
This reeks of anger and desperation.

10:43.609 --> 10:46.109
- I don't think it's intentional.
- Yes!

10:49.331 --> 10:50.447
Oh, thank God.

10:50.449 --> 10:52.082
Hey, shrimp girl.

10:52.084 --> 10:54.084
You know, this isn't where
we keep the leftovers.

10:54.086 --> 10:57.170
- I was locked in here.
- Kinky, I like it.

10:57.172 --> 10:58.922
Well, don't mind me. Just in here to grab

10:58.924 --> 11:00.674
a few bottles of this Cabernet,

11:00.676 --> 11:03.927
which is more expensive than my rent.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.261
I skwerkeled it.

11:05.263 --> 11:07.817
Just to be clear, I'm
not one of these people.

11:07.843 --> 11:09.933
Well, your boyfriend is.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.685
Play your cards right and you could be.

11:11.687 --> 11:13.303
He's not my boyfriend.

11:14.151 --> 11:18.475
Um, there are no boyfriends around me...

11:18.477 --> 11:20.310
Right now.

11:20.312 --> 11:21.354
Me either.

11:22.698 --> 11:24.230
So, why are you at this party

11:24.232 --> 11:26.366
if you're not part of
this whole soap opera?

11:26.643 --> 11:28.448
I came here to...

11:31.707 --> 11:34.157
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

11:34.159 --> 11:35.408
You just gave me an idea.

11:35.410 --> 11:38.044
On equal treatment of data
and open web standards,

11:38.046 --> 11:40.080
I said to myself, "I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life

11:40.082 --> 11:41.631
with that woman."

11:41.633 --> 11:44.668
- And here we are.
- This is your last chance.

11:44.670 --> 11:45.969
Promise me you won't tell Karma

11:45.971 --> 11:48.004
or I'm about to make a scene so juicy

11:48.006 --> 11:49.639
I might win a daytime Emmy.

11:49.641 --> 11:51.091
What if I tell her I slept with someone

11:51.093 --> 11:52.509
and I don't say that someone was you?

11:52.511 --> 11:53.927
Not a negotiation, last chance.

11:53.929 --> 11:55.979
Wow, you're completely mental.

11:55.981 --> 11:58.064
This is what secrets do to people.

11:58.066 --> 11:59.432
- Three, two...
- You wouldn't dare

11:59.434 --> 12:03.737
'cause then you'd have no leverage.

12:03.739 --> 12:05.939
How dare you?

12:05.941 --> 12:07.190
That was one.

12:07.192 --> 12:09.659
- Amy, come on.
- Don't touch me!

12:09.661 --> 12:12.362
- Amy.
- Do you know where I met Liam?

12:12.364 --> 12:13.530
At a protest.

12:13.532 --> 12:15.832
And do you know what we were protesting?

12:15.834 --> 12:17.367
Skwerkel.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.369
- Liam.
- But it turns out,

12:19.371 --> 12:20.704
he was just seducing me.

12:20.706 --> 12:24.374
He never told me his
father founded the company.

12:24.376 --> 12:26.843
Who are you, Liam Booker?

12:26.845 --> 12:28.712
That's hilarious.

12:28.714 --> 12:29.879
Amy has been taking improv classes,

12:29.881 --> 12:31.381
and she's getting very good.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.216
And if that weren't enough of a betrayal,

12:33.218 --> 12:38.221
I also found out that he
slept with my best friend.

12:41.226 --> 12:45.562
Son, may I see you in another room?

12:48.700 --> 12:49.899
Hmm.

12:50.265 --> 12:52.621
And now my dad and I watch it together.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.010
He loves it when they
go, "Thank you, mood."

12:55.036 --> 12:59.505
It's adorable.

12:59.508 --> 13:01.458
Sorry, I fell asleep,

13:01.460 --> 13:04.795
and went back to 2009
when that still felt fresh.

13:04.797 --> 13:09.299
Tell me something nobody knows.

13:09.301 --> 13:13.937
Uh, yeah, I'm a quarter Filipino.

13:13.939 --> 13:16.557
And I struggle with it every day.

13:16.559 --> 13:18.642
Off the stage, you're wasting my time.

13:18.644 --> 13:21.528
Especially after Oliver showed us such

13:21.530 --> 13:26.233
real, raw emotion.

13:26.235 --> 13:27.735
Lauren Cooper,

13:27.737 --> 13:28.986
you're up.

13:28.988 --> 13:30.571
You've got talent, Mrs. Cooper.

13:30.573 --> 13:32.322
But I'm worried that you're just another

13:32.324 --> 13:35.075
pretty, blonde white girl
who's biggest struggle

13:35.077 --> 13:37.211
has been whether to have
a latte or a cappuccino.

13:37.213 --> 13:39.129
[Bleep] you, I've struggled.

13:39.131 --> 13:42.332
The kitty's got claws.

13:42.334 --> 13:44.117
Tell me how you struggled.

13:48.057 --> 13:50.841
I'm not like other girls.

13:50.843 --> 13:53.260
I was born...

13:57.850 --> 13:59.233
A perfectionist.

13:59.235 --> 14:00.901
Sounds terrible.

14:00.903 --> 14:04.521
Tell me about the pills
you're rumored to take.

14:04.523 --> 14:06.356
They're vitamins.

14:06.358 --> 14:09.443
Being a perfectionist
takes lots of energy.

14:09.445 --> 14:10.694
Next.

14:10.696 --> 14:11.862
You are getting really good

14:11.864 --> 14:13.447
at disappointing this family.

14:13.449 --> 14:14.665
And now, today of all days,

14:14.667 --> 14:16.200
this humiliation?

14:16.202 --> 14:18.202
Are you trying to ruin
your sister's engagement?

14:18.204 --> 14:19.420
Do not call her that.

14:19.422 --> 14:22.956
Haven't you ruined enough for her already?

14:22.958 --> 14:25.876
Now I have indulged this
little defiant phase,

14:25.878 --> 14:27.211
but I'm running out of patience.

14:27.213 --> 14:29.713
Now the company needs
this marriage to happen,

14:29.715 --> 14:31.048
so go out there and make things right.

14:31.050 --> 14:32.382
And how am I supposed to do that?

14:32.384 --> 14:37.104
You're an artist, be creative.

14:40.059 --> 14:41.191
Even on a good day the juice truck

14:41.193 --> 14:42.810
doesn't make very much money.

14:42.812 --> 14:44.144
Boo-hoo.

14:44.146 --> 14:45.479
I lived on Graham crackers

14:45.481 --> 14:47.364
and slept on throw pillows for two years

14:47.366 --> 14:49.399
before I was cast as a featured performer

14:49.401 --> 14:51.318
on a carnival cruise,

14:51.320 --> 14:52.619
but I digress.

14:52.621 --> 14:54.404
Tell us about your recent breakup

14:54.406 --> 14:55.489
with your girlfriend.

14:55.491 --> 14:58.158
Are you heartbroken?

14:58.160 --> 15:02.045
Uh, you know, I mean, people split up.

15:02.047 --> 15:03.413
Taylor Swift pretty much said it all.

15:03.415 --> 15:04.915
Karma!

15:04.917 --> 15:07.084
What kind of empty life will you lead

15:07.086 --> 15:08.886
if you don't know yourself?

15:08.888 --> 15:10.504
What can you bring to your characters?

15:10.506 --> 15:12.541
Tear off your mask.

15:13.726 --> 15:15.526
I am heartbroken.

15:16.812 --> 15:20.049
But not for the reason everyone thinks.

15:24.603 --> 15:28.941
Okay, I know this will
probably make everybody hate me,

15:30.582 --> 15:32.359
but I'm not really a lesbian.

15:35.183 --> 15:36.113
Go on.

15:36.730 --> 15:39.082
Someone mistook my best friend and me

15:39.084 --> 15:41.952
as a couple. It got us attention

15:41.954 --> 15:44.121
and popularity, which were two things

15:44.123 --> 15:47.341
that I always wanted.

15:47.343 --> 15:50.711
I had said we should go
with it, and Amy agreed.

15:53.799 --> 15:56.466
I made you believe that
I'm somebody that I'm not,

15:56.468 --> 15:59.136
and I'm sorry.

15:59.138 --> 16:00.971
I could be a really insecure person,

16:00.973 --> 16:03.891
and I hate that part of who I am.

16:03.893 --> 16:07.110
Desperate for approval.

16:07.112 --> 16:10.781
Like me, like me.

16:10.783 --> 16:12.900
'Cause if you like me, then

16:12.902 --> 16:14.318
maybe I'll like myself.

16:19.909 --> 16:22.709
Brava.

16:22.711 --> 16:25.045
Brava.

16:26.165 --> 16:28.165
Consider this a peace doughnut.

16:28.167 --> 16:29.633
I acted like a mental patient.

16:29.635 --> 16:32.169
And how can I make things
better with your dad?

16:32.171 --> 16:34.171
Don't worry about it.

16:34.173 --> 16:36.089
Things were bad long before tonight.

16:36.091 --> 16:38.675
Part of me admires what you did.

16:38.677 --> 16:41.178
You rocked the boat.

16:41.180 --> 16:46.099
Something that I've
been too chicken to do.

16:52.524 --> 16:56.076
I just want to say
that I'm sorry we caused

16:56.078 --> 16:59.696
a commotion on such an important day.

16:59.698 --> 17:02.032
But why stop there?

17:02.034 --> 17:04.417
I'm sorry for being a disappointment.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.920
I'm sorry that I have no interest

17:06.922 --> 17:08.338
in joining the family business.

17:08.339 --> 17:10.624
I'm sorry for being an artist,

17:10.626 --> 17:14.377
since money and power
mean everything to you.

17:14.380 --> 17:16.512
I guess I'm sorry for even being born.

17:16.515 --> 17:21.300
- Liam, please not now.
- Right, Mom?

17:21.303 --> 17:23.887
That's enough, Liam.

17:23.888 --> 17:25.939
That's right, folks.

17:25.941 --> 17:30.310
Robin, my sister, is really my mother.

17:30.312 --> 17:32.062
She got herself knocked up at 16,

17:32.064 --> 17:34.031
and those two, my grandparents.

17:34.033 --> 17:37.284
They shipped her off to
boarding school in Switzerland,

17:37.286 --> 17:39.319
and then they raised me as their son.

17:39.321 --> 17:41.455
They've all been lying
about it for so long,

17:41.457 --> 17:43.740
that they actually now believe it.

17:43.742 --> 17:46.243
Oh, L'Chaim.

17:50.382 --> 17:52.587
Wow.

17:54.586 --> 17:55.836
Great party.

18:01.488 --> 18:03.104
If you've come to kick me while I'm down,

18:03.105 --> 18:05.172
just please don't.

18:06.525 --> 18:09.360
I came to say I admired
your honesty earlier.

18:09.362 --> 18:11.779
I wouldn't be surprised if you win.

18:11.781 --> 18:14.365
Seriously, I'm not playing mind games.

18:14.367 --> 18:16.784
So what, are we friends now?

18:16.786 --> 18:19.286
I wouldn't go that far.

18:19.288 --> 18:21.455
But I do have empathy for you

18:21.457 --> 18:26.377
and your... situation.

18:26.379 --> 18:27.461
Thanks.

18:27.463 --> 18:28.712
But if you're so desperate

18:28.714 --> 18:30.014
for people to like you,

18:30.016 --> 18:32.910
maybe you shouldn't be an actress.

18:34.303 --> 18:35.769
You might have a point.

18:35.771 --> 18:37.388
Should I go tell Margot you're withdrawing

18:37.390 --> 18:38.389
from the competish?

18:38.391 --> 18:40.607
Uh, no.

18:40.609 --> 18:43.394
I think you're pretty brave.

18:43.396 --> 18:45.813
I can never sing and dance in public.

18:45.815 --> 18:48.315
Trust me, I'm doing us all a favor.

18:48.317 --> 18:50.284
Yeah? You're that bad?

18:50.286 --> 18:52.069
Yeah, but I own it.

18:52.071 --> 18:53.987
It's my thing.

19:09.338 --> 19:12.005
Who the [bleep] is Oliver?

19:12.007 --> 19:13.974
I cannot believe... Did I just really say

19:13.976 --> 19:15.309
all of that out loud?

19:15.311 --> 19:16.393
You did.

19:16.395 --> 19:17.644
And your family...

19:17.646 --> 19:19.146
Probably disowned me, but right now,

19:19.148 --> 19:21.432
I do not give a [bleep].

19:21.434 --> 19:24.234
I have a huge weight off my back.

19:24.236 --> 19:27.604
Now I get why you're
so hung up on honesty.

19:27.606 --> 19:30.274
Yeah, well a few years
ago I accidentally found

19:30.276 --> 19:31.525
my original birth certificate

19:31.527 --> 19:33.610
and my whole world cracked.

19:33.612 --> 19:35.662
It weighed me down ever since.

19:35.664 --> 19:38.282
I wish somehow I could unknow it,

19:38.284 --> 19:43.170
but, I can't.

19:43.172 --> 19:45.372
I don't want to tell Karma
something she can't unknow,

19:45.374 --> 19:47.007
I care about her way too much.

19:47.009 --> 19:48.926
That's just how I feel, thank you.

19:48.928 --> 19:52.846
Yeah.

19:52.848 --> 19:54.548
This morning we had one secret between us,

19:54.550 --> 19:56.262
now we have two.

19:58.804 --> 20:02.439
Oh, I'm still wearing
your sis... mom... mom...

20:02.441 --> 20:03.724
momster's dress.

20:03.726 --> 20:06.527
Don't worry about it.

20:06.529 --> 20:08.479
- She's got plenty.
- And these earrings?

20:08.481 --> 20:13.233
I could pawn them and pay for college.
