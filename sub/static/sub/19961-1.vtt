03:25.906 --> 03:28.666
- Hey, Zack, awesome race.
- Thanks.

03:28.781 --> 03:32.261
I guess you're looking good
for the nationals? Congratulations.

03:32.406 --> 03:35.366
Thanks. You coming to the party tonight?

03:35.490 --> 03:37.450
Oh, yeah, yeah. As if I'd miss that!

03:37.532 --> 03:40.212
We'll find a nice quiet corner
and you can blow me, then.

03:42.115 --> 03:44.515
You know what, man? Fuck you!

03:47.199 --> 03:49.479
Sorry, I didn't hear. What was that?

03:49.574 --> 03:51.414
- Got you, sweetheart.
- Excuse me?

03:51.491 --> 03:54.171
Hey, Dazza. Good race, man.

03:54.283 --> 03:56.603
Yeah, I suppose seventh is
an improvement.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.660
You going to step things up for
the trials when they come round?

03:59.784 --> 04:01.864
I'm not really in it
for the competition.

04:01.951 --> 04:05.951
It's the shower time he likes.
Watch your arse around this one!

04:06.118 --> 04:08.678
- Don't worry about him.
- Do I look worried?

04:08.785 --> 04:11.225
You're two unit physics, aren't you?

04:11.326 --> 04:14.286
- OK, that question makes me nervous.
- No, let's walk.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.463
I can give you my notes.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.845
Why don't you just look over
my course journal?

04:20.942 --> 04:22.502
Look over? You mean complete.

04:22.567 --> 04:24.567
Why not? You're good at that stuff.

04:24.651 --> 04:27.291
- That's a whole term's worth of work.
- I just need a pass.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.761
- Study?
- Look, look, listen, listen.

04:29.859 --> 04:33.056
I'm actually making you an offer.
You understand me, right?

04:38.069 --> 04:40.389
I'm not going to be responsible
if you fail.

04:40.485 --> 04:42.445
I'll probably fail it anyway.

04:42.527 --> 04:45.678
- Fine. Give me your notes.
- Man, you fucking rock the planet.

04:53.362 --> 04:54.922
You coming to the house?

04:54.987 --> 04:56.907
Shit, man, I've got work to do.

04:56.987 --> 04:59.587
Don't be such a fucking martyr.
Enjoy yourself for once.

04:59.696 --> 05:03.136
Well, that probably sucked for you, man.

05:03.279 --> 05:05.839
- He giveth, he taketh away.
- Yeah, I reckon.

05:05.946 --> 05:08.146
- Do you know what can be fun.
- What?

05:08.238 --> 05:11.998
The sense of freedom - it's like
you can finally connect with people

05:12.155 --> 05:14.955
because they let go of their barriers
and just be themselves.

05:15.072 --> 05:18.112
But sometimes people can be
really scary when they're like that.

05:18.239 --> 05:20.799
Yeah, I guess it depends.

05:20.906 --> 05:24.026
- I'll see how I go, OK?
- OK.

05:24.156 --> 05:25.716
Hey, he's coming.

05:25.781 --> 05:27.901
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:27.990 --> 05:29.630
I'll see you tonight?

05:29.698 --> 05:31.578
Maybe.

his last breath, his life ebbing away.

Shay!

Shay, what are you doing here?

10:19.601 --> 10:21.681

it's our last year, that's all.

There's no need to fucking analyse it.

wants to go, right?

She asked if your brother
was going to be there.

Really?

10:53.896 --> 10:55.456
Yeah.

10:55.521 --> 10:59.081

That would be a messed up couple.

10:59.230 --> 11:01.744
Yep.

11:07.022 --> 11:09.782
You don't look like your brother.

Really? What's with your name?

11:16.981 --> 11:23.181
My mum married his dad
so I'm stuck with it.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.160
I used to be a Hayward.

11:25.232 --> 11:27.992

I know. You never speak to me.

At first I thought it was 'cause of
the whole swimming-team cool factor.

11:40.192 --> 11:42.912
Then I realised
you don't speak to them either.

11:43.025 --> 11:45.425
I actually swim because I like it.

We're dead already!
This is the afterlife, so party!

21:05.245 --> 21:08.078
- It's a Buddhist thing.
- You're fucked, man.

21:15.246 --> 21:17.441
You're all talk, bro.

22:19.127 --> 22:22.403
Xan? Xan, come on, I'll take you home.

22:41.129 --> 22:42.960
So you're right to drive?

22:59.589 --> 23:01.545
♪ Techno music thumps

24:51.308 --> 24:54.428
Relax, man. You're probably
getting all worked up over nothing.

24:54.558 --> 24:56.478
Yeah, so where is she?

24:56.559 --> 24:59.039
I don't know, dude.
Just sounds like a good party to me.

24:59.142 --> 25:01.022
Yeah. It fucking rocked!

25:01.101 --> 25:04.101
- Were you two even going out?
- Shay, that's not the point.

25:04.226 --> 25:06.386
- Dude, tell your dad.
- Which one?

25:06.476 --> 25:08.676
Biological
or that thing that fucks my mother?

25:08.768 --> 25:11.208
In that case, Darren,
I guess you're on your own.

25:11.310 --> 25:13.510
Thanks, Shay. I usually am.

25:17.436 --> 25:19.436
'In the Oresteia,
the royal line survives

25:19.519 --> 25:21.759
through combined human
and divine justice

25:21.853 --> 25:24.253
but only because the gods relent.

25:24.353 --> 25:26.793
The message repeated
throughout the trilogy

25:26.895 --> 25:28.615
that the doer suffers and learns.

25:28.687 --> 25:31.647
Justice, and the gods' own
closed and immortal world

25:31.770 --> 25:34.210
is largely the same
as that of mortal men.

25:34.312 --> 25:36.672
Anything is punished
that threatens the stability...'

25:38.354 --> 25:40.345
Come on, man!

25:41.521 --> 25:45.150
Hi. No, it's me. Darren.

25:50.230 --> 25:51.743
Sure.

25:55.356 --> 25:57.836
Hey.

25:57.939 --> 26:00.339
Hey. Where is she?

26:00.440 --> 26:02.520
I thought you'd know.

26:02.607 --> 26:05.007
Oh, I should have just stayed with her.

26:05.107 --> 26:06.787
Why?

26:06.857 --> 26:08.415
Ella, what happened?

26:13.608 --> 26:15.808
- Alright?
- Yeah, thanks.

26:15.899 --> 26:17.579
Awesome party.

26:17.650 --> 26:20.290
Do I know you?

26:20.400 --> 26:22.240
Sorry, Zack. Let's just bail. Let's go.

26:22.317 --> 26:24.597
I'm just kidding, man.
I'm just messing with you.

26:24.692 --> 26:26.572
OK.

26:28.651 --> 26:30.571
Sort him out, will you?

26:30.651 --> 26:32.767
Here comes your in-law.

26:38.443 --> 26:40.163
What's up?

26:40.235 --> 26:43.315
I just spoke to Ella.

26:43.444 --> 26:45.164
- Who?
- Dyke.

26:45.236 --> 26:47.236
Xandrie's friend.

26:47.319 --> 26:51.279
OK. Why, what did she say to you?

26:51.445 --> 26:54.525
- What happened to Xandrie?
- Why, what have you heard?

26:54.653 --> 26:57.053
I'm asking you.

26:57.153 --> 27:01.793
- OK, let's talk at home, alright?
- Did you sleep with her?

27:01.987 --> 27:05.184
Did I sleep with her?

27:06.404 --> 27:09.157
Daz, she fucked most of us.

27:10.363 --> 27:12.399
OK?

27:13.697 --> 27:17.017
It happens. Alright?

27:17.155 --> 27:20.995
Hey, how's my physics coming along,
by the way?

27:21.156 --> 27:23.147
I'll get around to it.

27:24.323 --> 27:26.279
Good man.

27:49.825 --> 27:51.865
Nice walking with you.

27:51.950 --> 27:54.305
Yeah, I enjoy our little chats.

27:55.492 --> 27:57.252
I'll come watch you poolside, or...

27:57.326 --> 27:59.556
Yeah, that'd be cool.

28:01.826 --> 28:04.215
Wait...

28:05.952 --> 28:10.232
You probably don't
want to be seen with me.

28:10.410 --> 28:13.370
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know how things work.

28:13.494 --> 28:15.974
It'd be unpopular.

28:16.078 --> 28:18.598
Everybody knows what happens
to flowers in adversity.

28:18.703 --> 28:20.343
Not around here.

28:20.411 --> 28:23.483
Bad is never good until worse happens.

28:26.037 --> 28:30.189
You're turning me down.
How sensible of you.

29:35.252 --> 29:36.924
Hey, you're home.

29:41.211 --> 29:43.131
I'm not doing your physics.

29:43.211 --> 29:45.731
Why not?

29:45.836 --> 29:47.596
I'm busy.

29:47.669 --> 29:49.229
Your mum's busy.

29:49.295 --> 29:51.251
Not funny.

30:47.550 --> 30:49.188
Yeah!

31:04.218 --> 31:07.018
Hey, Jon, can we talk?

31:07.135 --> 31:09.415
What's going on?

31:09.511 --> 31:12.351
Tell me what happened at the party.

31:12.469 --> 31:14.029
Watch yourself, Daz.

31:14.094 --> 31:16.294
- Did something happen?
- I didn't say that.

31:16.386 --> 31:17.986
Well, just tell me, please?

31:18.053 --> 31:21.728
I don't know, man. She was wasted.
I didn't even see her.

31:25.929 --> 31:27.965
Now you're just fucking dead.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.889
You're an idiot.

31:45.556 --> 31:48.236
Wait, wait, wait!

31:48.348 --> 31:51.468
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

31:51.598 --> 31:53.078
Fuck you, man!

31:53.140 --> 31:55.495
Where's Xandrie?

32:02.266 --> 32:04.382
I can't tell you, man.

32:05.558 --> 32:07.867
You know I can't.

32:09.516 --> 32:11.076
Fuck.

32:11.141 --> 32:13.141
Sorry, Daz.

32:13.225 --> 32:16.137
They'll kill me, man.
You know they'll kill me.

32:47.061 --> 32:50.061
You're confusing me, Darren.

32:50.187 --> 32:52.187
About your homework?

32:52.270 --> 32:55.110
Tell me what you're doing.

32:55.229 --> 32:58.149
What you think you're doing.

32:58.271 --> 33:00.262
You did something you shouldn't have?

33:01.438 --> 33:03.394
Nothing happened.

33:04.563 --> 33:06.474
Nothing happened.

33:07.647 --> 33:09.127
OK, OK.

33:09.189 --> 33:11.145
OK, if you say so.

33:12.522 --> 33:14.513
Now you're getting it.

34:24.321 --> 34:26.761
Cassi know you drive it like that?

34:26.862 --> 34:31.414
Christ. Would that mean
I'm hiding something from my parents?

35:47.578 --> 35:49.375
Hey, Daz!

35:56.996 --> 35:59.464
Hey. Hey!

36:00.663 --> 36:03.655
- It's really good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

36:10.581 --> 36:12.617
See you guys later.

36:29.207 --> 36:31.247
- Hey, babes.
- Hi.

36:31.333 --> 36:33.773
So you're back.

36:33.875 --> 36:35.955
With a vengeance.

36:36.041 --> 36:39.681
- That's great, babe.
- Courageous. Hi...

36:39.833 --> 36:43.030
Ella. We've met, actually.

36:47.751 --> 36:50.271
So, what's up?

36:50.376 --> 36:53.456
Just wanted to check in, babe.
See how you're going.

36:59.544 --> 37:02.144
Mm, I'm fine.

37:02.252 --> 37:03.772
Really?

37:03.836 --> 37:06.876
I heard you got really trashed

37:07.003 --> 37:10.363
and, like, hooked up with Zack and Brook
and then got arrested or whatever.

37:10.503 --> 37:12.783
Probably confused. My dad picked me up.

37:16.254 --> 37:18.210
You should know all this.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.418
It's your word against ours.

37:24.588 --> 37:26.624
Words.

37:41.339 --> 37:42.931
Oh, my God.

38:10.425 --> 38:12.381
I want to call home.

38:13.551 --> 38:16.019
I don't know.

38:18.343 --> 38:20.811
I don't know!

38:26.927 --> 38:29.521
Please, can you come and pick me up?

38:32.094 --> 38:34.892
Just come and pick me up!

39:18.932 --> 39:23.332
You know she dragged me to that
stupid party so she could see you.

39:23.516 --> 39:26.036
- You blame me for what happened?
- Hi, Ella Mathews.

39:26.141 --> 39:28.141
I don't need to blame you.

39:28.224 --> 39:31.455
Can I have some quiet, please?

39:32.683 --> 39:34.603
Didn't you beat up Jonathan?

39:34.683 --> 39:37.643
- A little.
- Why?

39:37.767 --> 39:39.807
I don't know. He deserved it.

39:39.892 --> 39:43.052
Like you got Brook off my back
when he was stalking me with those pics?

39:43.184 --> 39:44.784
Yeah, something like that.

39:44.851 --> 39:48.971
Darren, being nice for other people
is not the same as being nice to them.

39:49.143 --> 39:51.577
- Sometimes you just need to...
- Why are you here?

39:52.768 --> 39:54.808
I'm worried.

39:54.894 --> 39:56.964
Don't be.

39:59.144 --> 40:03.501
You selfish prick.
I'm talking about her.

40:31.522 --> 40:33.202
Chicks like that get upset

40:33.272 --> 40:35.192
when they do things
they're not proud of.

40:35.272 --> 40:37.072
She's not even the problem, OK?

40:37.148 --> 40:39.988
- What do you mean, the cops?
- Dude, how old are you?

40:40.106 --> 40:41.626
I mean the rest of the school.

40:41.690 --> 40:44.770
She's gonna get them excited,
they start the usual jibber-jabber.

40:44.898 --> 40:47.058
If my parents hear anything
about some girl...

40:47.148 --> 40:49.268
Just relax, OK?

40:49.357 --> 40:51.477
Look...

40:51.566 --> 40:54.166
people don't even
make their own decisions anyway.

40:54.274 --> 40:56.394
They just go with whatever sounds right.

40:56.483 --> 40:59.316
Keep it cool.

41:01.566 --> 41:04.846
- What?
- I should just throw another party.

41:04.983 --> 41:07.023
Fuck, no! Why would you do that?

41:07.109 --> 41:09.349
- Because people are easy.
- We're so on it.

41:09.442 --> 41:11.562
Yeah, it'll be fun.

41:11.651 --> 41:13.289
Done.

41:17.693 --> 41:19.773
Brooky, you're not talking.

41:19.860 --> 41:22.220
Doesn't matter if I get the state title,
does it?

41:22.318 --> 41:25.638
If I cop a charge,
I'm not going anywhere.

41:25.777 --> 41:27.449
A charge for what? Nothing happened.

41:57.738 --> 41:59.218
You're fucking dead!

41:59.280 --> 42:01.920
Take it easy, take it easy.

42:02.031 --> 42:05.151
He hasn't done anything. Have you, Daz?

42:05.281 --> 42:06.961
He says nothing in response.

42:07.031 --> 42:08.831
What the fuck is wrong with you?

42:08.906 --> 42:11.746
He's got his head in our shit
and you're gonna let him walk away?

42:11.865 --> 42:13.625
He's my brother. Just leave him alone.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.258
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

42:15.323 --> 42:16.803
Just don't.

42:16.865 --> 42:20.745
- I don't like it.
- You don't fucking have to.

42:20.907 --> 42:22.707
OK?

42:22.782 --> 42:24.822
Is everything alright?

42:24.908 --> 42:27.428
I don't know, man.

42:27.533 --> 42:29.573
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

42:29.658 --> 42:32.458
- What was he looking for?
- Beats me.

42:32.575 --> 42:35.248
Come on, let's eat.

43:13.214 --> 43:16.404
I'm out, guys.
Awesome party, man. See ya later.

43:18.204 --> 43:19.344
Boys.

43:19.496 --> 43:21.896
End of an era.

43:21.996 --> 43:25.316
The last year of our career,
then we're done!

43:27.914 --> 43:31.394
Getting old's for cunts.
Real men stay young.

43:36.373 --> 43:38.693
You're all talk, bro.

43:38.790 --> 43:40.550
What are you doing, bro?

43:40.623 --> 43:42.983
- Teaching you a lesson.
- Oh, bullshit.

43:43.082 --> 43:45.962
- Hey, watch the master.
- Bullshit you're going first.

43:46.082 --> 43:49.122
Fine. Go on. Hurry up, then.

43:49.249 --> 43:51.126
I will.

43:53.333 --> 43:56.131
Jono, check it out. Jono!

45:20.049 --> 45:22.609
So shouldn't she be at a clinic?

45:22.716 --> 45:25.156
Yeah, she was,
but her dad pulled her out.

45:25.258 --> 45:27.618
- No way. That sucks.
- Is Zack gonna sue?

45:27.717 --> 45:29.277
He should totally sue.

45:29.342 --> 45:31.542
Just because she feels bad
for being a trash bag

45:31.634 --> 45:33.634
doesn't mean
she has to make others suffer.

45:33.717 --> 45:36.597
- I think Zack should be scared.
- Should he?

45:36.717 --> 45:40.392
- No. No, I guess not.
- There she goes.

45:43.218 --> 45:46.130
Look at all the bruises on her legs.
Trash bag.

46:03.595 --> 46:05.551
I've got your phone.

46:06.720 --> 46:09.480
It's OK. I don't need it.

46:09.596 --> 46:11.396
It's no problem.

46:11.471 --> 46:13.826
Really, I don't know who I'd call.

46:15.013 --> 46:18.573
I usually carry it on me
but I forgot today.

46:18.721 --> 46:21.361
- Why?
- Why what?

46:21.472 --> 46:24.272
Why do you carry it?

46:24.389 --> 46:26.539
So I can give it back to you.

46:37.015 --> 46:39.404
Thanks for the thought.

46:45.766 --> 46:47.446
I'm not friends with them.

46:47.516 --> 46:49.356
It's OK.

46:49.433 --> 46:52.153
I mean, I go along with them
because of Zack and everything,

46:52.266 --> 46:55.546
but I'm not... not part of it, honestly.

46:55.683 --> 46:58.803
I know I should have been there.

46:58.934 --> 47:01.323
Oh, my God! Don't tell me that.

47:03.684 --> 47:07.524
I have something from that night...

47:07.684 --> 47:10.364
We don't have to talk about it.

47:10.476 --> 47:13.070
- I can help.
- How can you help?

47:14.727 --> 47:18.167
We'll go to the school.
We'll go to your dad.

47:18.310 --> 47:23.790
Darren, everyone's already
made up their mind about what happened.

47:24.019 --> 47:26.169
I still don't know.

47:27.353 --> 47:29.913
I blacked out.

47:30.020 --> 47:32.488
I woke up and I went home.

47:35.312 --> 47:36.665
I just...

47:37.812 --> 47:39.962
I just feel it.

47:42.646 --> 47:44.886
I feel them and what they did.

47:44.980 --> 47:46.698
It's part of me.

47:47.897 --> 47:50.172
It's part of this school.

47:53.064 --> 47:55.180
It's part of you.

48:00.689 --> 48:02.680
How can you help me with that?

48:05.148 --> 48:07.108
I'm sorry.

48:07.190 --> 48:09.260
Don't you dare.

48:11.482 --> 48:13.837
Now you walk away.

49:16.905 --> 49:18.941
It's Darren, right?

49:22.072 --> 49:23.552
Hey.

49:23.614 --> 49:26.414
- How are you going?
- Hey.

49:26.531 --> 49:28.891
Zack, how are ya?

49:28.989 --> 49:31.069
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Good.

49:31.156 --> 49:33.196
- Welcome, I guess.
- Thanks.

49:33.281 --> 49:35.241
So this is our house?

49:35.323 --> 49:37.043
Yeah. It's weird?

49:37.115 --> 49:38.555
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49:38.615 --> 49:43.375
So, I don't know,
what kind of stuff do you do?

49:43.574 --> 49:45.574
Not much.

49:45.658 --> 49:47.418
Sports or anything?

49:47.491 --> 49:49.891
Yeah, anything without a team. I swim.

49:49.991 --> 49:52.071
That has a team. I'm captain of it.

49:52.158 --> 49:53.958
Oh, cool. Can I be on it?

49:54.033 --> 49:56.113
If you're fast enough.

49:56.200 --> 49:58.080
OK.

49:58.159 --> 50:01.839
School sends away one of our boys to the
institute on a scholarship every year.

50:01.993 --> 50:03.393
Seriously, we're good.

50:03.451 --> 50:06.211
I'll just splash along behind,
make you look good.

50:06.326 --> 50:08.326
That doesn't make us look good.

50:08.410 --> 50:11.330
No, it's a defence. I'm awesome.

50:11.452 --> 50:13.408
So...

50:14.577 --> 50:16.297
You want a tour?

50:16.369 --> 50:18.325
- Yeah, lead on.
- Alright.

50:21.078 --> 50:24.438
How long were your parents separated?

50:24.578 --> 50:27.138
Three years or something.

50:27.245 --> 50:30.325
My dad ditched my mum when I was five.

50:30.454 --> 50:33.414
Bitch kept spending all his money,
so he paid her off in one hit.

50:33.537 --> 50:37.257
- Shit.
- Trust me, it's better like this.

50:37.413 --> 50:39.533
But he really seems...

50:39.621 --> 50:41.421
I don't know, he likes Cassi.

50:41.496 --> 50:44.056
- What's she like?
- Oh, she's great. You'll meet her.

50:44.163 --> 50:45.643
She's my mum.

50:45.705 --> 50:48.145
- Your dad seems cool.
- Yeah.

50:48.247 --> 50:50.807
He told me to look out for you
while he was away.

50:50.914 --> 50:53.434
Right. So you're the man of the house?

50:53.539 --> 50:55.619
Yeah.

50:55.706 --> 50:57.946
So. First day tomorrow.

50:58.039 --> 50:59.599
Yeah.

50:59.665 --> 51:01.345
Hey, what's our school like?

51:01.415 --> 51:03.895
I haven't really done
the private school thing.

51:03.998 --> 51:06.278
- Well, you'll meet her. She's great.
- Yeah?

51:06.374 --> 51:09.894
I wouldn't call it our school, though.

51:10.041 --> 51:13.192
But... Whose school is it?

52:00.129 --> 52:02.649
Mr Masters,
the principal will see you now.

52:02.754 --> 52:04.187
Great, thanks.

52:26.381 --> 52:28.770
They seem nice.

52:29.965 --> 52:32.274
I could have you charged.

52:33.465 --> 52:36.825
Yeah, you went to the police,
didn't you?

52:36.965 --> 52:38.717
What did they say?

52:40.591 --> 52:43.344
Did they ask if you were sure?

52:44.550 --> 52:46.859
Who else was there?

52:49.092 --> 52:51.812
Did they say they'd look into it?

52:51.925 --> 52:54.393
I think they got about as far as
my lawyer.

52:56.509 --> 52:59.149
You think you're untouchable.

52:59.259 --> 53:01.139
I've got witnesses.

53:01.218 --> 53:03.978
Four of them. I've got a reputation.

53:04.093 --> 53:07.253
I win medals for the school.
What do you do?

53:07.385 --> 53:09.465
Raise money for sick monkeys?

53:09.552 --> 53:11.752
- Homeless children.
- Whatever.

53:11.844 --> 53:14.358
Keep your mouth shut.

53:15.552 --> 53:17.912
You've got Darren all excited

53:18.011 --> 53:20.331
and you're running around
talking your bullshit.

53:20.428 --> 53:24.028
Just keep it to yourself,
and everyone will be just fine.

53:24.178 --> 53:29.127
You wouldn't be here
unless you were afraid.

53:30.429 --> 53:33.626
I went and saw the principal today.

53:34.846 --> 53:37.644
You know why?

53:38.846 --> 53:42.043
He wanted to see if I was OK.
Don't fucking cry.

53:46.472 --> 53:49.672
Don't come to my house again.

53:49.806 --> 53:52.843
Now you're getting it.

53:59.223 --> 54:03.263
Oh, be sure to thank your mother
for the refreshing cola.

54:08.682 --> 54:10.832
Oh, fuck.

54:26.392 --> 54:28.986
What are you doin'?

54:32.976 --> 54:36.173
Dad? Yeah, hi.

54:38.727 --> 54:41.007
No, no, everything's cool.

54:41.102 --> 54:44.542
I just need to withdraw some funds and
I wanted to run it by you first, though.

54:44.686 --> 54:47.917
Oh, kind of a school project.

54:49.978 --> 54:53.368
Of course it's for a party.
No, everything else is fine.

54:54.937 --> 54:58.497
OK. Alright,
I'll see you when you get back, Dad.

54:58.646 --> 55:02.958
Right. Love you, Dad. Bye.

56:24.029 --> 56:29.549
Have you ever wondered why
kids go to their school with an AK?

56:29.779 --> 56:31.699
Rage issues?

56:31.779 --> 56:34.532
Outrage, maybe.

56:37.363 --> 56:39.523
OK, let's do it.

56:39.613 --> 56:41.493
You in?

56:41.572 --> 56:43.452
We'd have to shoot ourselves after.

56:43.530 --> 56:46.610
Man, you've got to think about it
in terms of a ratio.

56:46.739 --> 56:50.659
Like the guy in Kauhajoki,
he was like 10 to 1. Epic fail.

56:50.823 --> 56:53.663
Virginia Tech was more like 30 to 1.

56:53.781 --> 56:56.941
That's better bang for your buck.

56:57.073 --> 56:59.433
Oh!

56:59.532 --> 57:02.172
So that's one to me.

57:02.282 --> 57:04.955
Dude, what the fuck? That was awesome!

58:49.376 --> 58:51.890
So anyway, I'm leaving.

58:56.085 --> 58:58.365
When?

58:58.460 --> 59:01.340
As soon as I can.

59:01.460 --> 59:06.820
I don't know if you've noticed,
but this place isn't real, anyway.

59:07.044 --> 59:12.364
- It's like some kind of...
- Parallel universe.

59:12.586 --> 59:18.186
Here we are, trapped in a bubble while
the rest of the world keeps turning.

59:18.420 --> 59:23.260
When we came here, my mum said
that this was the best school

59:23.462 --> 59:26.102
because it was the most expensive

59:26.212 --> 59:28.612
- Where is she?
- Away.

59:28.713 --> 59:32.672
She moved here to set me up,
and now I don't even see her.

59:47.464 --> 59:50.536
Do you remember first semester history?

59:51.757 --> 59:56.990
You gave a presentation
on the origin of moral law.

59:58.299 --> 01:00:01.257
Do you remember what a martyr is?

01:00:03.591 --> 01:00:05.191
What are you asking?

01:00:05.258 --> 01:00:06.611
Do you?

01:00:09.508 --> 01:00:11.544
In Greek, it means 'witness'.

01:00:13.884 --> 01:00:17.244
Witnesses were tortured for confessions,

01:00:17.384 --> 01:00:20.182
so it came to mean
someone who suffers for a cause.

01:00:23.718 --> 01:00:25.834
Do you need my notes?

01:00:31.385 --> 01:00:34.905
If you see something and do nothing,
you're not a witness.

01:00:35.052 --> 01:00:37.008
You're an accomplice.

01:01:55.268 --> 01:01:57.907
It's just training, man.
Don't worry about it.

01:02:00.227 --> 01:02:03.264
I only wanted him to give up on her.

01:02:05.478 --> 01:02:07.558
She would have been out of it.

01:02:07.644 --> 01:02:09.204
Totally.

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:11.500
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:02:14.478 --> 01:02:17.117
We're gonna get caught.

01:02:20.729 --> 01:02:22.409
Are you going to help me or not?

01:02:22.479 --> 01:02:24.197
- Chill out, man.
- Come on!

01:03:13.484 --> 01:03:15.839
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

01:03:18.818 --> 01:03:21.412
When are you leaving?

01:03:24.693 --> 01:03:27.013
It's like you said, man.

01:03:27.110 --> 01:03:29.950
She's not the problem, but him.

01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:35.469
With his pictures and rumours
and all that other bullshit.

01:03:35.694 --> 01:03:40.054
He's not taking away
my only ticket out of here.

01:03:40.236 --> 01:03:42.306
We have to, bro. Come on.

01:04:26.824 --> 01:04:28.496
Boo.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:32.625
Make it quick. Come on.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.372
Yeeow!

01:04:37.534 --> 01:04:39.047
Fuck.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:57.100
- You go round that way.
- Fuck off.

01:04:57.202 --> 01:04:59.079
Move, fucker!

01:05:37.039 --> 01:05:38.839
There he is.

01:05:38.914 --> 01:05:41.633
Look, there they go!

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:55.372
Fuck!

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.426
Where you going?

01:06:07.042 --> 01:06:09.237
- He's gone downstairs.
- Where you going, Daz?

01:06:19.502 --> 01:06:21.891
Where you going?

01:06:55.047 --> 01:06:57.117
Get up, fucker!

01:07:21.007 --> 01:07:23.475
Hey, how's that?

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:27.448
Hey?

01:07:27.508 --> 01:07:29.948
Brooky. Brooky?

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:32.450
Brooky, Brooky, hop up. Hop up.

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:34.270
You alright?

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:36.142
Did he get you?

01:07:36.217 --> 01:07:38.377
No.

01:07:38.467 --> 01:07:40.697
What a fucking mess.

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:46.313
Darren?

01:07:46.385 --> 01:07:50.185
Darren, there are two types of people
in this school.

01:07:50.343 --> 01:07:53.460
The first kind are useful to me, OK?

01:07:54.677 --> 01:07:58.437
The second kind is what you just became.

01:07:58.594 --> 01:08:01.506
Why do you do it?

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:06.440
Why do you need to drag people
so far down

01:08:06.595 --> 01:08:09.555
when you're already so far above them?

01:08:09.679 --> 01:08:11.559
Here's the trick to it, Daz.

01:08:11.637 --> 01:08:13.277
When you're really above people,

01:08:13.346 --> 01:08:15.466
you don't have to explain yourself
to anyone.

01:08:15.554 --> 01:08:17.225
For anything.

01:08:27.764 --> 01:08:30.684
Help him, for fuck's sake.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:32.966
Jono, get him out of here.

01:08:33.055 --> 01:08:35.015
Come on.

01:08:35.098 --> 01:08:36.689
Take him home.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.781
Guess he owed him lunch money.

01:08:40.848 --> 01:08:43.127
Seriously, though, guys,

01:08:43.223 --> 01:08:46.383
if you're going to start believing
all this bullshit he's spinning,

01:08:46.515 --> 01:08:48.715
you're going to get dragged down
to his level.

01:08:48.807 --> 01:08:53.527
You know? We don't need
that kind of attention. Not here.

01:08:53.724 --> 01:08:56.113
I thought we were better than that.

01:08:57.683 --> 01:09:01.676
Anyway, somebody call it.
I'm going to class.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.716
Give me your keys, man.

01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:16.872
Just get him in.

01:09:30.185 --> 01:09:31.904
Fuck, that's enough, man!

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.051
Well, look at you.

01:09:39.395 --> 01:09:41.115
You're a crazy bitch, you know that?

01:09:41.187 --> 01:09:44.346
- Careful.
- Xan, give me the fucking gun.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.238
Oh, fuck, man! Come on!

01:09:46.313 --> 01:09:47.984
You scratched my car!

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:54.663
Do you want your public to watch?

01:09:54.772 --> 01:09:56.692
I do, actually.

01:09:56.772 --> 01:09:59.532
'Cause you know what happens
if you shoot me?

01:09:59.647 --> 01:10:02.207
I've got a mental image.

01:10:02.314 --> 01:10:04.674
Have a look. Have a look!

01:10:04.773 --> 01:10:06.729
Things will be exactly the same.

01:10:14.649 --> 01:10:16.685
You'll still be a crazy bitch.

01:10:19.107 --> 01:10:23.339
And I'll still be the poor boy
everyone wishes you'd left alone.

01:10:24.608 --> 01:10:28.088
- You'll also be dead.
- And you'll have to live with it.

01:10:35.942 --> 01:10:38.331
Nothing you do will change anything.

01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:45.450
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Xan.

01:10:45.568 --> 01:10:47.479
I really am.

01:10:48.652 --> 01:10:50.608
Put the fucking gun down.

01:11:00.945 --> 01:11:03.698
Good luck in the finals.

01:11:22.864 --> 01:11:24.464
Jono?

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:25.929
Jono, let's go!

01:13:10.249 --> 01:13:12.849
He gets away with everything.

01:13:12.957 --> 01:13:14.997
Why do we let him?

01:13:15.082 --> 01:13:17.038
Do we?

01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:21.088
Everybody does.

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:24.605
They let him exist.

01:13:43.335 --> 01:13:45.565
Not for much longer.

01:13:56.878 --> 01:13:59.073
What did you tell the police?

01:14:01.378 --> 01:14:03.618
Nothing.

01:14:03.712 --> 01:14:06.472
Your counsellor?

01:14:06.587 --> 01:14:08.418
Nothing.

01:14:09.588 --> 01:14:11.419
Same.

01:14:12.755 --> 01:14:15.428
No-one can do anything anyway.

01:14:18.588 --> 01:14:20.579
What have you been doing?

01:14:27.423 --> 01:14:29.223
End-of-year project.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.254
What on?

01:14:47.633 --> 01:14:49.193
Fuck you.

01:14:49.258 --> 01:14:51.938
You just have to keep him outside.

01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:54.650
- I thought you were in.
- It was a joke, Darren.

01:14:54.759 --> 01:14:57.227
Yeah, it was.

01:15:10.718 --> 01:15:13.107
♪ Techno music thumps

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.473
Woo! Aaaah!

01:16:16.766 --> 01:16:18.324
Zack?

01:16:19.475 --> 01:16:21.625
Zack.

01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:08.107
Run along now.

01:17:09.313 --> 01:17:12.473
Were you there long enough
to see what they did?

01:17:12.605 --> 01:17:14.685
Or did you leave to spare yourself?

01:17:14.772 --> 01:17:17.692
Blah, blah, blah.

01:17:17.814 --> 01:17:20.044
I'm going downstairs.

01:17:27.481 --> 01:17:29.836
- Darren?
- Not yet. Dry the fuck up.

01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:36.839
You can both have a cry about it,
but not me.

01:17:40.316 --> 01:17:42.396
Are you telling me you feel nothing?

01:17:42.483 --> 01:17:45.156
No regret?

01:17:46.358 --> 01:17:48.118
I don't suppose you can,

01:17:48.192 --> 01:17:51.152
'cause you're not even a real person,
you're just an idea.

01:17:51.275 --> 01:17:54.435
You're a concept
of what boys want to fuck.

01:17:54.567 --> 01:17:56.167
Fuck you!

01:17:56.234 --> 01:17:58.304
You murdered a girl.

01:18:01.359 --> 01:18:03.509
You're a fucking psycho.

01:18:04.735 --> 01:18:06.646
Run along now.

01:18:16.361 --> 01:18:18.477
What are you doing?

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:23.251
Well, that depends on you.

01:18:52.323 --> 01:18:53.756
End of an era.

01:18:55.115 --> 01:18:56.946
Come on.

01:19:55.912 --> 01:19:58.152
- What's going on, man?
- Nothing, man. Let's go.

01:19:58.246 --> 01:20:00.966
- Why would you do that?
- He needs to fucking learn his place.

01:20:01.079 --> 01:20:02.956
Dude,
we've got a bigger fucking problem.

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:44.302
What's going on?

01:20:51.667 --> 01:20:53.987
- Is he here?
- Who?

01:20:54.084 --> 01:20:56.884
Little fucker! I'm gonna find him.

01:20:57.001 --> 01:20:58.639
Move!

01:21:23.254 --> 01:21:25.529
- Problems?
- Don't ask.

01:21:26.712 --> 01:21:28.352
Fair enough.

01:21:28.421 --> 01:21:31.581
Zack, I'm almost sober.

01:21:31.713 --> 01:21:33.313
What have you got on you?

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:35.575
What are you after?

01:21:37.505 --> 01:21:38.984
That'll do.

01:21:46.256 --> 01:21:48.008
- Hey, Zack.
- Hey.

01:21:49.464 --> 01:21:51.184
Can we talk?

01:21:51.256 --> 01:21:53.656
It's one of those fuckin' nights,
isn't it?

01:21:53.756 --> 01:21:56.316
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:21:56.423 --> 01:21:58.141
- You're fucked!
- Leave me alone!

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:02.060
Darren!

01:22:02.132 --> 01:22:03.531
Dar-ren!

01:22:07.841 --> 01:22:10.721
Darren, what the fuck are you doing?

01:22:10.841 --> 01:22:13.241
Jon, you wanna help?

01:22:13.342 --> 01:22:14.782
What?

01:22:14.842 --> 01:22:16.594
What's he up to?

01:22:19.676 --> 01:22:22.395
Turn around, dickhead.

01:22:27.926 --> 01:22:29.526
Dazza!

01:22:29.593 --> 01:22:33.473
You've got something you want
to tell me, don't ya? Don't ya?!

01:22:33.635 --> 01:22:35.675
How about you fucking say it?

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.796
Say it to my face, you little fucker!

01:22:43.094 --> 01:22:44.652
You...

01:22:54.012 --> 01:22:55.889
Now help.

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:10.296
Weird fucking night.

01:23:15.931 --> 01:23:18.286
Fucking hell, Simone.

01:23:22.015 --> 01:23:26.008
Look, you're pissed, you know.
We can forget about this.

01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:39.545
Here, have a drink.

01:23:46.934 --> 01:23:49.084
Whatever.

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:29.849
Hey, guys, what's going on?

01:24:32.188 --> 01:24:33.860
Nothing, man.

01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:37.243
Right.

01:24:40.856 --> 01:24:43.654
You don't even care, do you?

01:24:44.856 --> 01:24:47.165
I'm going inside.

01:24:50.815 --> 01:24:52.885
- He fucking killed her.
- Yeah, I reckon?

01:24:57.232 --> 01:24:59.992
Even when you've had enough,
you just keep wanting more.

01:25:00.107 --> 01:25:02.257
You're like fucking leeches.

01:25:03.441 --> 01:25:05.161
OK, fine.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:07.673
You want to do this?

01:25:07.775 --> 01:25:10.015
Yeah, it happened. She was raped.

01:25:10.108 --> 01:25:13.548
It was Brook and Jono.
They were off their fucking heads.

01:25:13.692 --> 01:25:16.252
I try to help her,
and I try to look after my mates.

01:25:16.359 --> 01:25:19.159
Maybe that's where I went wrong.

01:25:19.276 --> 01:25:21.516
I guess you can't look after everybody.

01:25:21.609 --> 01:25:24.449
But you know what? Party's over.
Fucking go home.

01:25:24.568 --> 01:25:26.208
Done.

01:25:26.277 --> 01:25:28.837
I try to do something nice
for everyone. Look what...

01:25:50.654 --> 01:25:52.565
♪ Techno music thumps

01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:20.665
Are you gonna kill me?

01:28:31.544 --> 01:28:33.614
It's a bad move, Darren.

01:28:35.003 --> 01:28:37.312
Bad idea.

01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:42.820
You realise what'll happen
if you do something like this,

01:28:42.962 --> 01:28:45.192
you go through with something like this?

01:28:56.755 --> 01:28:58.666
Darren?

01:28:59.838 --> 01:29:04.158
OK, Darren. You listen to me and you
listen really fucking carefully, OK?

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:06.375
You think this through.

01:29:08.964 --> 01:29:11.194
I can't just hate you.

01:29:12.673 --> 01:29:14.664
Don't get me wrong. I do.

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.115
But there's just no point.

01:29:19.299 --> 01:29:22.179
See, the real problem is

01:29:22.299 --> 01:29:27.499
that you're only you
because you're allowed to be.

01:29:27.716 --> 01:29:30.996
And I don't want to live in a world
that sick,

01:29:31.133 --> 01:29:34.133
so how do I solve this problem?

01:29:34.258 --> 01:29:36.218
You know, I can't...

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.053
I mean, I can't take them all out, so...

01:29:43.801 --> 01:29:45.234
Or...

01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:57.583
Either way... the sickness remains.

01:29:59.427 --> 01:30:02.146
Xandrie knew that.

01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:08.745
What are you going to do?

01:30:18.304 --> 01:30:20.693
Here's the trick.

01:30:26.263 --> 01:30:28.902
I'm not leaving this up to either of us.

01:31:05.517 --> 01:31:08.077
You should be relieved.

01:31:09.267 --> 01:31:11.986
Popular opinion is what you're best at.

01:31:48.438 --> 01:31:50.718
I'm your fucking brother!

01:31:50.813 --> 01:31:53.093
Darren! Don't do this!

01:31:53.188 --> 01:31:56.108
Don't do this! I'm your fucking brother!

01:31:56.230 --> 01:31:58.619
Turn the fucking thing off!
