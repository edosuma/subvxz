09:42.182 --> 09:44.616

the full monty on denton.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.318
Your murdered landlord.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.119
He's got
an extensive arrest record.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.287
- What did
denton do time for?

09:49.289 --> 09:50.789
- Multiple weapons violations.

09:50.790 --> 09:52.290
The last one, he did
four years in stateville,

09:52.292 --> 09:54.593
and we think that's
where he met you're guy.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.729
All right, first off,
let's get an id.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.798
Who do you recognize?

10:02.736 --> 10:05.103
- This guy.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.304
- Eddie owens.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.839
You gotta know
what you're dealing with.

10:07.841 --> 10:10.108
He had written up
a personal manifesto,

that he set to go off

10:12.212 --> 10:14.112

he murdered denton?

10:23.223 --> 10:24.756

10:24.758 --> 10:26.758
- What are the police
doing to find owens?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.226
- Uh,
we identified his cell,

10:28.228 --> 10:29.327
and we obtained
a trap and trace

10:29.329 --> 10:31.096
along with a ping order.

10:31.097 --> 10:32.864
The problem is
he only turns his phone on

10:32.866 --> 10:35.066
long enough to check messages,
so we haven't been able

10:35.068 --> 10:36.301

10:36.303 --> 10:38.637

the place that burned?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.140

helpful in tracking him.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.745

roll some squads here.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.864
There wouldn't have been
anything left to find.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.298
- Why not?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.400
- Because ofi already
went through that place

11:08.402 --> 11:10.068

11:10.070 --> 11:11.202
