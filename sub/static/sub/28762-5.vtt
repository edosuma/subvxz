00:00.055 --> 00:01.806
The burial mounds
are spread out

00:01.894 --> 00:03.666
throughout this whole area.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.152
When I asked her,
"who are you talking to,"

00:05.239 --> 00:06.954
she said,
"the woman, mama."

00:07.041 --> 00:11.158
this female spirit has been seen
by multiple people.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.961
Can you come out of the water
like you have before?

00:14.048 --> 00:15.996
- Are you here?
- What was that?

00:16.082 --> 00:18.065
You guys alright?
Did it say, "Jesus"?

00:18.152 --> 00:19.400
Were you up in the tower?

00:19.487 --> 00:21.201
Whoa!
This thing just lit up!

00:21.288 --> 00:23.337
What's wrong?
I don't know!

00:29.192 --> 00:30.910
There are things in this world

00:30.998 --> 00:32.947
that we will never
fully understand.

00:33.407 --> 00:34.788
<i>Understand.</i>

00:34.876 --> 00:37.533
We want answers.

00:37.738 --> 00:43.970
We have worked years to build
our credibility, our reputation,

00:45.212 --> 00:48.148
working alongside
the most renowned professionals

00:48.236 --> 00:49.563
in the field,

00:49.798 --> 00:52.633
capturing groundbreaking proof
of the paranormal.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.124
It's working!

00:54.212 --> 00:56.103
I can't give you
an explanation.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.540
This is <i> our</i> evidence...

Episode Title :<font color=#FFFF00>" Alibion Castle"</font>

01:06.579 --> 01:08.648
We're in San Francisco,
California,

01:08.736 --> 01:12.962
here to investigate a very old
and mysterious castle,

01:13.253 --> 01:14.968
a castle that will deliver us

01:15.056 --> 01:18.634
one of our most amazing
investigations to date.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.228
That's it.

01:20.926 --> 01:24.843
That's the Albion Castle...
150 years old.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.501
The family that lives here,

01:27.588 --> 01:30.504
they've been seeing
the apparition of a woman.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.540
They don't know who she is
or where she came from,

01:33.627 --> 01:35.843
but this woman has appeared

01:35.930 --> 01:39.087
and even held down
a member of the family.

01:39.517 --> 01:43.350
In 1870, Albion Castle
was a successful brewery.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.519
It thrived for 49 years.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.689
Then in 1919,
the national prohibition act

01:48.776 --> 01:51.658
ended their prosperity.

01:51.745 --> 01:55.614
Soon after, it was abandoned
and left in a state of decay.

01:57.583 --> 02:01.233
Albion castle also
sits directly on top of large,

02:01.422 --> 02:03.737
underground water caverns

02:03.824 --> 02:06.440
thought to possess
mystical properties

02:06.527 --> 02:10.330
ever since Ohlone indians
inhabited this land.

02:10.491 --> 02:13.674
The Ohlone lived here
for 10,000 years

02:13.801 --> 02:16.817
and survived countless
violent conflicts

02:16.904 --> 02:19.953
protecting their home
and sacred water,

02:20.040 --> 02:23.624
water that fuels paranormal
energy and gives it life.

02:26.113 --> 02:29.096
The family that now owns
the castle has been afflicted

02:29.183 --> 02:32.232
by the unknown entities
that roam the property,

02:32.319 --> 02:36.637
most prominent are the multiple
reports of a female apparition.

02:36.724 --> 02:40.207
How long has your family
owned Albion Castle?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.742
About six years now.

02:41.829 --> 02:46.713
Underneath this castle, there
are all these different tunnels.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.153
In these tunnels,
there's natural spring water?

02:53.240 --> 02:55.022
Yeah,
10,000 gallons a day.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.223
10,000 gallons a day.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.825
And how many tunnels
are there?

02:57.912 --> 02:59.393
There are three.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.495
It is down here
in these dark,

03:01.582 --> 03:05.065
moist passageways
where Jennifer's daughter,

03:05.166 --> 03:08.070
Gerelyn, had
a terrifying encounter

03:08.158 --> 03:10.337
with a notorious
female apparition.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.772
Okay,
so, this is the first time

03:11.859 --> 03:15.175
that I'm going to go
inside of the water caverns.

03:15.262 --> 03:16.810
So, this is where
you saw the woman?

03:16.897 --> 03:18.946
Yeah. This was the second time
that I saw the woman.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.914
Second time?
You saw her a first time, too?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.549
Yeah. I saw her the first time,
she was, like,

03:22.636 --> 03:23.984
hovering over the bed.

03:29.910 --> 03:34.027
Multiple sighting of
the very same entity is evidence

03:34.114 --> 03:37.884
that it has chosen to stay
and not cross over for a reason.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.289
Could this woman be
protecting something

03:40.377 --> 03:43.416
she feels is threatened,
something sacred?

03:43.591 --> 03:45.772
Take me in there
and tell me exactly

03:45.947 --> 03:49.580
where you saw this woman
come out of the water.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.634
Okay.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.349
Are you okay?
Yeah, but...

03:56.570 --> 03:57.939
What?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.353
Maybe you should go first.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.107
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

04:04.251 --> 04:05.916
Holy cow.

04:06.787 --> 04:08.902
You don't really
expect this.

04:13.632 --> 04:15.380
What?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.055
Is that water in there?

04:17.153 --> 04:20.267
Yeah, it's actually
all natural water springs.

04:20.498 --> 04:22.313
This is
underneath the castle.

04:22.494 --> 04:26.892
Something can be very
protective of what this is,

04:27.175 --> 04:29.815
and I heard that
over 300 years,

04:29.903 --> 04:33.197
there was conflict
over this water.

04:33.431 --> 04:36.007
The Ohlone Indians knew
the great worth

04:36.095 --> 04:38.142
of this fresh spring water.

04:38.380 --> 04:40.829
They believed it had
healing properties,

04:40.948 --> 04:45.548
which is why so many sacrificed
their lives to protect it.

04:45.957 --> 04:48.205
My mom thinks that
this water is sacred.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.704
She thinks that I may have
disrupted it

04:50.791 --> 04:52.239
by going down here
with my friends.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.283
You didn't go in the water,
though, right?

04:55.089 --> 04:57.275
I did.
Like, you swam in here?

04:57.431 --> 04:58.478
Yeah.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.689
You saw this spirit
in the water?

05:00.777 --> 05:01.777
Yeah.

05:04.676 --> 05:08.320
I was trying to leave, and then
I couldn't see her at all,

05:08.408 --> 05:10.623
and then I felt something
pushing down on me.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.859
So, after you saw her,
it was behind you... Yeah.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.828
...As if she came out of
the water and was behind you.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.296
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:16.383 --> 05:19.266
Could Gerelyn's interaction
with this sacred water

05:19.353 --> 05:22.269
be the reason
for this entity to manifest

05:22.356 --> 05:24.771
in such an aggressive manner?

05:24.858 --> 05:28.842
As we exit the tunnel,
Aaron hears something.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.444
Mike and I just caught it.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.578
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.347
It was like a woman
singing or going...

05:34.668 --> 05:35.901
Let me see a microphone.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:46.954 --> 05:48.653
Whistling.

05:53.407 --> 05:54.434
Did you hear that?

05:54.521 --> 05:55.821
Yeah.

05:55.909 --> 05:57.858
Nothing.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.938
The water drops could be
creating pareidolia.

06:01.026 --> 06:02.407
Right.

06:02.495 --> 06:05.063
With all of the water
dripping sounds,

06:05.165 --> 06:06.748
it's really hard
to determine

06:06.836 --> 06:10.550
whether we are hearing actual
paranormal sounds and voices

06:10.637 --> 06:14.655
or if our ears are playing
tricks on us through pareidolia.

06:27.373 --> 06:30.890
Whatever happened down here in
these caverns is lost in time.

06:31.275 --> 06:32.662
We don't know
what happened here.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.674
We could be standing
in the very area

06:34.762 --> 06:37.157
where something
extremely tragic happened

06:37.364 --> 06:40.040
or somewhere
where a woman was drowned.

06:40.334 --> 06:43.008
When you have water like this
coming from a spring

06:43.270 --> 06:45.516
in a solid rock tunnel,

06:45.937 --> 06:50.436
you have a very, very powerful
energy source for this spirit

06:50.524 --> 06:52.925
to be able to manifest
at the level

06:53.013 --> 06:56.797
of what she is appearing as.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.932
We head to the yard
behind the castle

06:59.019 --> 07:01.535
to hear that Jennifer's
younger daughter

07:01.622 --> 07:05.339
had an experience with
the very same woman Gerelyn did.

07:08.962 --> 07:12.297
So, this is the backyard
property right here.

07:14.266 --> 07:15.749
My daughter was
sitting right there.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.651
So, she was sitting here
as if she was talking to,

07:17.738 --> 07:20.187
like, you, like somebody
was standing there.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.922
Yes.
What was she saying?

07:22.009 --> 07:23.724
She said, "okay,
I'll stay here."

07:23.811 --> 07:25.392
and so when I asked her,
"who are you talking to,"

07:25.479 --> 07:26.793
she said,
"the woman, mama."

07:26.880 --> 07:31.813
this is interesting, to have
a 5-year-old see the same spirit

07:31.985 --> 07:33.667
as your other
older daughter.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.402
Yes, and describes her
with the same

07:35.489 --> 07:37.772
- long, dark hair, just in a nicer form.
- Okay, they described it in

07:37.859 --> 07:39.381
- detail, the same woman,
- Yes.

07:39.469 --> 07:40.325
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

07:40.413 --> 07:42.297
And then the landscaper
was here?

07:42.385 --> 07:44.677
He was too scared
to come all the way up.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.389
He was very, very scared.
He started praying.

07:47.477 --> 07:51.017
Okay, are you sure that he did
not see this woman, too?

07:51.104 --> 07:53.891
He wouldn't say.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.321
He actually packed his bags
and left,

07:56.409 --> 07:58.257
and he didn't come back
to work here ever.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.787
- Are you serious?
- I am serious.

07:59.875 --> 08:00.994
He was that scared.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.562
I think
that there's more to it.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.579
I think that he probably
saw her, as well.

08:05.750 --> 08:09.688
The thing to me about this case
as I'm hearing it

08:09.776 --> 08:17.008
um is that this female spirit has been
seen by multiple people,

08:17.096 --> 08:19.712
but I can, like, feel her.

08:19.858 --> 08:23.180
And I know that sounds like me
being a psychic medium,

08:23.290 --> 08:26.206
but it's more of me
being a sensitive

08:26.363 --> 08:31.357
to feeling something bound
to this property

08:31.445 --> 08:34.078
and all of the stones
that are here.

08:34.283 --> 08:38.462
And the magnification of
the stone tape theory here

08:38.551 --> 08:41.672
is just,
it's insane,

08:41.822 --> 08:46.375
because everything you step on
is a earth-made solid.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.108
I mean,
everything here is rock.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.576
All of this is rock.

08:49.663 --> 08:55.899
So everything that this spirit
has touched in her real life

08:56.144 --> 08:59.592
is the same thing that us,
in this moment right now,

08:59.680 --> 09:01.788
is touching with our own feet
and our own hands.

09:01.875 --> 09:08.161
We're connecting to that same
recorder that she connected to,

09:08.248 --> 09:11.832
so you literally connect
yourself to these spirits

09:11.919 --> 09:15.035
through the very surfaces
that you touch.

09:18.459 --> 09:22.276
After hearing these absolutely
compelling experiences,

09:22.496 --> 09:26.346
all describing the very
same dark-haired apparition,

09:26.433 --> 09:28.281
we've come to find out
that there has been

09:28.368 --> 09:32.619
another terrifying sighting
by jeff, a contractor.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.154
Jeff, I would like you
to tell me

09:34.241 --> 09:36.790
what you saw
standing in this window.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.493
I was down in
the courtyard here,

09:39.580 --> 09:42.262
and I was supposed to meet
Jennifer here,

09:42.349 --> 09:46.016
and I looked up,
and I saw a woman standing here.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.335
So, you saw the woman, too,

09:48.422 --> 09:51.671
standing right where we're at,
the very top of the tower?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.139
Right here, looking down.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.610
What did she look like?

09:55.817 --> 09:57.843
Just long, dark hair.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.336
To me, I thought somebody
was here

10:02.424 --> 10:03.664
that wasn't supposed
to be here,

10:03.852 --> 10:06.881
so I went over
and checked the doors,

10:06.969 --> 10:09.689
and the alarm was still on,
and I called Jennifer,

10:09.776 --> 10:11.055
and I said,
"are you here?"

10:11.157 --> 10:12.392
so, she wasn't even
on the property?

10:12.479 --> 10:14.394
No. I said, "there's somebody
in the place,

10:14.481 --> 10:15.896
so you need to get here."

10:15.983 --> 10:19.232
and we got here, disarmed it,
came in, there was nobody here.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.516
I've never seen so many
different people,

10:22.627 --> 10:24.610
different connections
to this place...

10:24.725 --> 10:26.706
Somebody
who's done work here,

10:26.793 --> 10:30.110
a little girls that's 5 years
old, the oldest daughter...

10:30.197 --> 10:33.413
All of you are seeing
the same woman with dark hair.

10:33.500 --> 10:34.714
My eyes still work.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.950
I did see something.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.157
There was nobody
in the house.

10:39.994 --> 10:43.498
We are unable to explain
what is going on.

10:43.586 --> 10:44.724
There's a fog
down there.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.844
- Oh, my God!
- That's a jaw.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.686
Continuing our
investigation of Albion Castle

10:56.774 --> 10:58.061
here in San Francisco,

10:58.149 --> 11:00.273
I have discovered
some chilling history

11:00.360 --> 11:02.162
that may help us
to understand

11:02.250 --> 11:04.277
the presence
of the female apparition

11:04.364 --> 11:06.846
seen by multiple people
in the castle

11:06.933 --> 11:10.183
and in the massive
underground water caverns.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.420
Alright, guys, it's day 2
of our investigation

11:13.507 --> 11:16.905
of the Albion Castle,
which is right there.

11:16.993 --> 11:18.525
I can see it
across the bay.

11:18.612 --> 11:19.960
So, I did a little research

11:20.047 --> 11:22.094
because we got to find
out the identity

11:22.182 --> 11:26.474
of who this woman spirit is
that's shown herself

11:26.562 --> 11:28.701
to a lot of
different people over there.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.637
They all described her
the same.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.439
So, I had to do
some research

11:32.526 --> 11:34.541
to help us try to find out
why she's there.

11:34.628 --> 11:36.959
Now, this area that
we're on right now

11:37.047 --> 11:40.447
and the area where Albion Castle
sits is called hunters point.

11:40.534 --> 11:44.584
This was inhabited by
the Ohlone native americans.

11:44.671 --> 11:47.687
They were here for 10,000 years.
Wow.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.295
I found out that the Ohlone
would do

11:50.383 --> 11:53.526
these huge sacred
burial mounds.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.397
In many cases, the Ohlone
shell mounds

11:56.485 --> 12:00.033
are said to contain children
lost at childbirth,

12:00.120 --> 12:01.901
buried next to their mothers,

12:01.988 --> 12:07.007
their bodies then covered
with soil, shells, and rock.

12:07.094 --> 12:11.277
The burial mounds are spread
out throughout this whole area,

12:11.364 --> 12:12.712
but when I looked
at the map

12:12.799 --> 12:16.416
of where these Ohlone
shell mounds were,

12:16.503 --> 12:18.251
there's two of them
that were located

12:18.338 --> 12:20.053
right here
on hunters point.

12:20.140 --> 12:26.192
Right there, sitting exactly
where Albion Castle sits.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.344
No way.

12:27.432 --> 12:32.735
That water that still runs
underneath Albion Castle today

12:32.853 --> 12:37.037
was a sacred water source
for the Ohlone.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.973
There could be remains
of the Ohlone

12:40.060 --> 12:42.242
underneath
of Albion Castle.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.928
Those mounds
could have been desecrated

12:45.016 --> 12:46.579
by modern civilization,

12:46.666 --> 12:49.249
by the buildings of what
we're looking at right now.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.452
But not only that,
the sacred water

12:52.539 --> 12:55.021
was then used to make beer.
That makes sense.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.858
So, any time that that water
source is disturbed

12:58.945 --> 13:00.894
on top
of the burial mounds

13:00.981 --> 13:03.096
that were right here
where the castle is...

13:03.183 --> 13:05.198
Yeah.
...Could ignite the apparition

13:05.285 --> 13:08.735
of this spirit
if she is Ohlone.

13:08.822 --> 13:12.639
We need to agitate that water,
but let's do it respectfully.

13:12.726 --> 13:15.575
We set up our equipment
inside the dark water cavern

13:15.662 --> 13:18.978
where Gerelyn saw
the female apparition emerge.

13:19.065 --> 13:22.749
Looking beneath the dark surface
of this sacred spring

13:22.836 --> 13:26.186
may provide some evidence
to bring us closer to the spirit

13:26.273 --> 13:27.554
and why she is here.

13:27.641 --> 13:29.789
Alright, we're gonna use
this underwater camera

13:29.876 --> 13:33.793
to take a look inside
of this mineral spring water.

13:36.450 --> 13:37.866
When we look down here,
we can see

13:37.954 --> 13:41.438
that there's things
at the bottom of this.

13:42.056 --> 13:45.471
Right over here.
What is that?

13:45.559 --> 13:48.678
As we begin scanning the bottom
of this water cavern,

13:48.766 --> 13:50.680
we begin to see something.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.991
That, to me, just looks
like a rock, doesn't it?

13:53.079 --> 13:55.014
Yeah.
So, I'm gonna scan over a little bit more.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.616
What was that?
What's that?

13:56.703 --> 13:57.751
What is that?

13:57.838 --> 13:58.785
What is that?
What is that right there?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.553
I don't know.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.797
Billy.
Whoa. What is that?

14:01.885 --> 14:02.969
What is that?

14:03.248 --> 14:05.864
- What is that?
- I don't know.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.860
Oh, my God!
Look at that!

14:07.948 --> 14:09.313
Look.

14:09.830 --> 14:12.046
That's a jaw bone.
That's a jaw.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.733
See?
Yeah, those are teeth.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.901
Oh, that's teeth.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.970
Oh, whoa, you guys.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.438
Oh, my God.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.572
Do you see that?

14:19.659 --> 14:21.641
That's, like, fur?

14:21.728 --> 14:23.743
As we watch
the monitor closely,

14:23.830 --> 14:28.281
we discover what we are seeing
is a dead possum

14:28.368 --> 14:31.284
but are confused as
to how it could have drowned.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.254
I mean, look at this,
you guys.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.089
Look at the waterline
on this.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.811
- It's like this.
- I know.

14:37.899 --> 14:39.530
If an animal was swimming
in here,

14:39.618 --> 14:41.399
they could have easily
gotten out of here.

14:41.487 --> 14:44.694
Sure.
There's a lip about this big.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.199
Well, it's running over
right there.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.668
It's literally level.
It's running over.

14:48.755 --> 14:52.605
And if it climbed back somewhere
back there, that's just a wall.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.873
I'm trying
to figure this out.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.309
How could an animal
have climbed up here, Bill,

14:56.396 --> 14:58.511
and just died over there?

14:58.598 --> 15:01.481
But could that also be some type
of offering for this spirit?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.116
That's what
I was thinking.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.185
After seeing what's
underneath the water

15:05.272 --> 15:08.254
and capturing evidence of this
mysterious dead animal

15:08.341 --> 15:12.258
that drowned, it's now time
to see what is on the other side

15:12.345 --> 15:15.211
of this very dark
water cavern.

15:15.382 --> 15:19.666
So, Billy modified this
remote-control boat.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.734
Really, Billy?

15:21.821 --> 15:24.938
Hey, when you're as smart as us,
you do good, old smart things.

15:25.025 --> 15:28.241
It was too heavy, so we
had to add some pontoons.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.139
So, you can see that there's
a camera on it.

15:30.227 --> 15:31.744
Good job
modifying that, guys.

15:31.831 --> 15:32.946
- Thanks.
- Good job.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.461
I want to see how far
we could get back there,

15:35.669 --> 15:37.327
and what we want
to look for is,

15:37.415 --> 15:40.954
we want to see if this spirit
will manifest

15:41.041 --> 15:45.358
from something foreign
being in her water.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.274
Go ahead
and roll on that.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.516
Can we see you?

15:55.655 --> 15:58.189
There's something
in your sacred water.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.529
Can you come out of the water
like you have before?

16:06.249 --> 16:07.915
Can you show yourself?

16:10.437 --> 16:11.885
We don't want
to disrespect you

16:11.972 --> 16:15.657
or your water source
or your caverns.

16:16.176 --> 16:16.990
- Why is it...?
- I don't have anything.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.191
No.
Nothing?

16:18.278 --> 16:19.392
Nothing.
That's weird

16:19.479 --> 16:20.860
'cause as soon
as we start talking about it,

16:20.947 --> 16:21.828
it was closer, and it glitched.
As soon as we went over there,

16:21.915 --> 16:22.896
and that's when
you felt the chills.

16:22.983 --> 16:23.897
Whoa.
Feel that.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.365
- Feel that.
- Oh, yeah.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.666
Can you feel that
right there?

16:26.753 --> 16:27.800
That's what I'm trying
to say.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.102
Look at right here.
Right here.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.703
Yeah, it's right here.
Literally right here.

16:30.790 --> 16:33.172
Feel this, right here.
Right there, yeah.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.775
- Ice cold. Ice cold.
- Yes, yeah.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.110
That made goose bumps.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.245
That made my arm hair
stand up on end, man.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.980
I'm telling you.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.148
I didn't feel any of this

16:42.235 --> 16:43.983
during the underwater
camera experiment.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.285
Now it's on me.

16:45.372 --> 16:46.753
This is all happening
with the boat in the water.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.121
Look at that.
I know. That's exactly.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.124
It went from me
and now it's right here.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.359
We have not felt anything...
Oh, my gosh!

16:53.446 --> 16:55.461
Feel this right here.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.963
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.468
I'm getting excited because
not only are we feeling this,

16:58.555 --> 17:01.401
but it's creating energy
within us.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.770
None of us have felt
what we are feeling

17:03.857 --> 17:06.039
the entire time
we've been down here,

17:06.126 --> 17:09.041
including our earlier interview
with Gerelyn.

17:09.128 --> 17:12.045
There also are no drafts
in these caves.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.446
Could this be a sign
that the lady apparition

17:14.534 --> 17:18.938
is going to manifest visually
or audibly?

17:19.271 --> 17:20.852
As the boat returns to us,

17:21.023 --> 17:23.954
we notice something has happened
to the camera.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.589
- No.
- What?

17:25.678 --> 17:26.795
No.
It shut it off.

17:26.883 --> 17:27.894
How did it stop?

17:27.981 --> 17:29.883
There's no way
for it to stop.

17:30.163 --> 17:32.233
Why would that turn off
automatically?

17:32.321 --> 17:33.733
It shouldn't have.
That's a gopro camera.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.568
Right.
I know.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.337
There's something
happening here, you guys.

17:37.424 --> 17:38.538
There's something going on.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.573
Why would it do that?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.775
Dude, is it getting foggy
down there?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.577
Look down there.

17:44.664 --> 17:45.845
No, there is a fog.

17:45.932 --> 17:49.349
There's a fog down there
now all of a sudden.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.583
Right there, fog.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.851
There is fog there.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.786
Fog in that corner back there.
There is.

17:53.873 --> 17:57.090
As we maneuver the boat
into the fog,

17:57.177 --> 18:00.827
the camera audio
captures a strange sound...

18:03.583 --> 18:07.066
...And inexplicably
shuts off yet again.

18:07.153 --> 18:10.003
I have never seen a gopro
stop recording by itself.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.171
This is the first time
this has happened.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.740
What is happening
right now...

18:13.827 --> 18:18.411
We are unable to explain
what is going on in this moment.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.847
That is the second time
that something has stopped

18:20.934 --> 18:22.081
recording
on this gopro camera.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.716
Can you please tell me
how much battery

18:23.803 --> 18:25.785
out of 100%
we have right now?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.720
What?
What is it?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.689
17% or something.
17%?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.657
15%.
15%.

18:31.744 --> 18:36.028
Extreme and abrupt temperature
changes, a sudden foggy mass,

18:36.115 --> 18:40.800
and major battery drainage are
usually experiences associated

18:40.887 --> 18:43.703
with an entity being
in close proximity.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.540
We still don't know if this
entity is the Ohlone woman,

18:47.627 --> 18:51.477
but we can confidently surmise
that whoever she is,

18:51.657 --> 18:54.947
she is powerful and present.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.483
You didn't like us going down
there with the boat, did you?

18:57.570 --> 18:59.685
Did something happen to you
when you were alive?

18:59.772 --> 19:01.821
Are you the lady
in white?

19:10.483 --> 19:11.610
Okay, this is it.

19:11.698 --> 19:14.586
We're getting ready to start our
investigation of Albion Castle

19:14.907 --> 19:16.803
in San Francisco, California.

19:16.890 --> 19:20.773
What we want to do
is try to document evidence

19:20.860 --> 19:24.143
of this widely
seen female apparition

19:24.230 --> 19:28.181
of a woman who seems very
protective of the water caverns

19:28.268 --> 19:31.050
down below underground
in the tunnels.

19:31.137 --> 19:34.687
Now, this natural water spring
was very sacred

19:34.774 --> 19:36.522
to the native americans

19:36.609 --> 19:39.258
that were here
for over 10,000 years.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.028
There are also nearby
shell mounds

19:42.115 --> 19:45.298
or burial mounds
of the Ohlone tribe,

19:45.385 --> 19:46.599
so we may be dealing

19:46.686 --> 19:50.103
with an apparition
of a native american woman.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.905
We don't know why,
but it's absolutely incredible

19:52.992 --> 19:56.409
how many people have seen
the same apparition.

19:56.496 --> 20:00.213
Before we head into the castle,
we will start our investigation

20:00.300 --> 20:02.682
down in the underground
water caverns.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.257
Hello?

20:15.734 --> 20:17.516
As we reach the water caverns

20:17.684 --> 20:20.977
where the apparition of this
woman has been seen swimming

20:21.079 --> 20:24.971
and becoming very aggressive
if anyone goes into the water,

20:25.118 --> 20:27.440
I decide to conduct
an experiment.

20:27.527 --> 20:31.410
Okay, so, what I did is, I got
a high-powered laser beam

20:31.497 --> 20:34.347
and I laid it perfectly level
with the waterline

20:34.434 --> 20:37.383
all the way
to the back of the cavern.

20:37.579 --> 20:41.008
So, this laser is about
this high off

20:41.157 --> 20:43.618
the water the whole way.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.459
You could see the reflection
of the laser in the water

20:46.546 --> 20:48.828
and the laser
going over the water.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.563
So, I want to see
if that laser beam

20:50.650 --> 20:52.365
will have any type of reaction,

20:52.452 --> 20:55.535
if there's any portal here,
if there's any spirit here.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.137
And we have been given
information that this spirit

20:58.224 --> 20:59.906
has swam in the water,

20:59.993 --> 21:02.475
and I literally want to see
if this spirit

21:02.562 --> 21:06.913
will breach out of the water
and break this laser beam.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.745
Over on the other side where the
second water cavern is located,

21:10.833 --> 21:13.886
I also set up an infrared
time-lapse camera to see

21:13.973 --> 21:17.089
if we can capture
this female spirit in the water.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.795
I decide to head back
to nerve center

21:22.882 --> 21:25.865
where I can keep an eye
on these experiments while Billy

21:25.952 --> 21:28.568
and Aaron investigate
one of the other caves.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.089
Aaron.

21:50.176 --> 21:51.956
This is what I was telling you
about.

21:52.044 --> 21:56.062
This hole right here is directly
over the end of the other...

21:56.149 --> 21:57.296
The first tunnel.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.931
The first tunnel
where we drove the boat,

21:59.018 --> 22:02.168
it goes this way,
and this is the end of it.

22:02.255 --> 22:04.337
And this hole right here
goes right over the area

22:04.424 --> 22:07.106
that we saw
where the boat shut off

22:07.193 --> 22:09.909
and also
where the fog was.

22:09.996 --> 22:10.876
I got an idea.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.079
Why don't we remove
the wire.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.314
I brought a tool
right over there.

22:15.401 --> 22:18.351
That stick and a roll
of gaff tape.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.886
Let's take a digital recorder,
tape it to that,

22:20.973 --> 22:23.489
and lower it down
and ask questions.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.424
Okay, good idea.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.494
As Billy attaches the recorder
to this wooden pole

22:28.581 --> 22:30.930
then lowers it down directly
above the water

22:31.017 --> 22:34.000
in the other cavern,
he begins asking questions

22:34.087 --> 22:36.535
in an attempt
to communicate with the woman.

22:36.622 --> 22:39.071
Do you want to say
anything to us?

22:39.158 --> 22:42.608
We've already had great contact
with you,

22:42.695 --> 22:44.310
but we feel like
there's something going on

22:44.397 --> 22:48.032
at the end of this water cavern
that's below us.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.771
You didn't like us going down
there with the boat, did you?

22:55.808 --> 22:57.441
What do you want
to tell us?

23:00.179 --> 23:03.696
Do you want us to leave?

23:03.783 --> 23:05.398
Are you the lady in white

23:05.485 --> 23:08.252
and did we communicate
with you upstairs?

23:11.691 --> 23:13.973
After several questions,
Billy and Aaron

23:14.060 --> 23:17.576
do not capture any evps,
and back at nerve center,

23:17.663 --> 23:20.212
I am seeing no visual evidence
on the cameras

23:20.299 --> 23:22.048
that are covering
the other caverns,

23:22.135 --> 23:26.218
so we wonder if the woman spirit
is currently inside the castle.

23:26.305 --> 23:29.121
What we are about to walk into
will be one of the most

23:29.208 --> 23:33.059
compelling investigations
we have ever conducted.

23:33.146 --> 23:34.260
Ready?

23:40.987 --> 23:42.601
We come with respect for you

23:42.688 --> 23:46.372
and the underground springs
and the caverns,

23:46.459 --> 23:48.607
and if something happened to you
when you were alive...

23:48.694 --> 23:49.875
A crime or a murder

23:49.962 --> 23:53.913
or whatever happened to you...
We want to know.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.599
We want to help.

23:58.171 --> 23:59.852
Man,
it's dead silent in here.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.528
Yeah.
It's so quiet.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.200
Are you up in the tower?

24:26.365 --> 24:29.715
Watch your screen very closely
for what is about to be captured

24:29.802 --> 24:32.739
on our x camera
as I tell Billy and Aaron

24:32.849 --> 24:34.787
to go investigate
the castle tower.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.259
You know
what I might do?

24:40.346 --> 24:42.027
Hmm?
What is that?

24:42.114 --> 24:44.964
Why don't I send you two guys up
in the tower

24:45.051 --> 24:46.799
and I'm gonna stay down here
by myself

24:46.886 --> 24:49.735
because the noises that are
happening in this kitchen.

24:49.822 --> 24:50.803
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:50.897 --> 24:53.339
As this very slow moving
and misty

24:53.427 --> 24:55.349
light anomaly hovers over me,

24:55.466 --> 24:57.835
I feel something,
and you can even see me react

24:57.930 --> 25:01.080
right as this anomaly
passes over my head.

25:04.327 --> 25:06.986
My whole right arm
just went ice cold.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.339
It sounds like a woman.

25:08.427 --> 25:10.895
I'm hearing
terrifying screams.

25:16.415 --> 25:18.597
At Albion Castle
in San Francisco,

25:18.684 --> 25:22.768
I focus my energy on
a specific paranormal hotspot.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.504
Okay, so, all this activity
we've been

25:25.591 --> 25:27.406
hearing behind
vienna's kitchen.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.809
Just noises, noises, noises.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.449
So, what I'm want to do is
I want to sit here

25:40.536 --> 25:42.073
with my back to the kitchen.

25:42.161 --> 25:45.190
I got my camera in there
aimed towards the cupboards.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.259
They've opened up
all the cupboards to see

25:47.346 --> 25:50.095
if something can be thrown
out of the cupboards,

25:50.182 --> 25:52.450
and I'm gonna sit down here
by myself

25:52.544 --> 25:54.268
with this camera,
jay watching me.

25:54.356 --> 25:55.761
I'm just gonna do
an evp session.

25:55.849 --> 25:58.164
I want you guys to go all way
up into the tower

25:58.251 --> 25:59.733
where Gerelyn saw the woman

25:59.820 --> 26:01.901
floating above her bed
when she was sleeping.

26:01.988 --> 26:03.236
She was, like,
hovering over the bed.

26:03.323 --> 26:05.705
And then go all the way
to the tippy-top

26:05.792 --> 26:08.208
where jeff, the worker,
saw her standing in the window

26:08.295 --> 26:10.644
staring at him while he was
in the front property.

26:10.731 --> 26:14.114
So, you saw the woman, too,
standing right where we're at,

26:14.201 --> 26:15.615
the very top of the tower?

26:15.702 --> 26:17.217
Right here looking down.

26:20.874 --> 26:24.257
Listen, we are here
to contact you.

26:24.344 --> 26:26.526
My two friends are heading up
into the the tower

26:26.613 --> 26:30.020
right now to see you.

26:30.249 --> 26:32.636
I'm gonna stay down here
by myself

26:32.724 --> 26:35.005
with my back
towards the kitchen.

26:35.317 --> 26:37.737
I think it's incredible
how you've shown yourself

26:37.825 --> 26:41.942
to so many of the living...
So many people.

26:47.366 --> 26:50.649
This is Zac, EVP session,
first floor,

26:50.737 --> 26:53.177
Albion Castle.

26:53.432 --> 26:55.014
Whoa.

26:55.242 --> 26:56.256
Whoa, whoa!

26:56.343 --> 26:58.777
My whole right arm
just went ice cold.

27:02.347 --> 27:05.463
As I'm hold my digital recorder
out, I begin to feel

27:05.651 --> 27:08.801
my right arm go freezing cold
at the same exact time

27:08.889 --> 27:11.337
that this light anomaly
appears above it.

27:11.424 --> 27:12.906
What's even more incredible
is that

27:12.993 --> 27:16.176
I capture an EVP
in this moment,

27:16.263 --> 27:20.080
leading us to believe that this
anomaly is part of a spirit.

27:32.712 --> 27:34.961
Aaron and Billy have now climbed
all the way

27:35.048 --> 27:36.296
to the top of the tower

27:36.383 --> 27:38.832
where the woman spirit
is often seen.

27:43.490 --> 27:45.205
Hey.

27:45.292 --> 27:48.141
What window do you think
they see her out of?

27:48.228 --> 27:49.976
You think
it's the front one?

27:53.433 --> 27:55.949
Okay.
Wait, you had a great idea.

27:56.036 --> 27:58.169
We'll just stack up
some bean bags.

27:59.206 --> 28:01.788
...right here shooting
at the geophone,

28:01.875 --> 28:02.856
so if she shows up

28:02.943 --> 28:04.924
to the window,
we try to talk to her.

28:05.011 --> 28:07.827
Maybe the emf lights
will light up the blue lights.

28:11.484 --> 28:13.785
I invite you to
manifest yourself.

28:16.089 --> 28:19.372
Show me your features
of your face,

28:19.459 --> 28:21.259
your body,
and your silhouette.

28:25.565 --> 28:27.198
Look at me
and I'll look at y...

28:32.772 --> 28:35.355
At the same exact time
I hear a loud bang,

28:35.442 --> 28:37.257
this light anomaly
appears again

28:37.344 --> 28:41.961
right beside me as it moves
across the wood surface.

28:42.048 --> 28:44.030
Look at me
and I'll look at y...

28:44.117 --> 28:46.786
Is this spirit making contact
with the wall

28:46.966 --> 28:48.368
to produce the bang?

28:48.455 --> 28:50.737
Look at me
and I'll look at y...

29:06.468 --> 29:07.882
I'm h...

29:13.480 --> 29:16.696
I'm hearing
terrifying screams.

29:16.783 --> 29:20.300
I begin to hear a series
of blood-curdling screams,

29:20.387 --> 29:22.068
and immediately
open the front door

29:22.155 --> 29:25.572
to rule out the possibility that
they are coming from outside.

29:25.659 --> 29:27.841
And when I go out there,
I hear nothing.

29:27.928 --> 29:30.710
These screams, which Billy
and Aaron also hear,

29:30.797 --> 29:33.446
are captured the loudest
on this x camera

29:33.533 --> 29:36.200
that's positioned
halfway up the tower.

29:44.844 --> 29:46.778
Do you hear that?

29:47.748 --> 29:50.153
What is that?

29:51.070 --> 29:52.936
It sounded like a woman.

30:07.434 --> 30:10.850
As I'm still trying find out
where these screams came from,

30:10.937 --> 30:12.952
watch the railing
on the staircase

30:13.039 --> 30:16.422
as this large, misty,
foggy-type anomaly

30:16.509 --> 30:20.226
appears to come down the stairs
and then over the railing.

30:40.133 --> 30:42.448
I don't know if the other guys
heard that.

30:42.535 --> 30:47.754
I heard, like,
10 just loud screams,

30:47.841 --> 30:51.560
just like someone screaming
for their life.

30:58.805 --> 31:01.302
Do you hear that?

31:01.855 --> 31:04.138
What is that?

31:05.225 --> 31:07.020
It sounded like
a woman.

31:15.535 --> 31:17.331
I don't know where it was
coming from.

31:17.419 --> 31:21.621
I opened the door, but I didn't
hear anything outside.

31:21.966 --> 31:24.419
Getting really, really bad,
um...

31:33.944 --> 31:35.864
This spirit's trying
to communicate with us.

31:36.055 --> 31:37.469
Did it say Jesus?

31:37.557 --> 31:38.538
Zac,
what's getting you?

31:38.625 --> 31:40.124
I don't know.

31:46.199 --> 31:48.362
In the tower
at Albion Castle,

31:48.450 --> 31:50.917
Aaron and Billy
try to locate the window

31:51.004 --> 31:54.220
where a female apparition
has been seen.

31:54.307 --> 31:55.955
Okay.

31:56.042 --> 31:57.590
Could be this window, too.

32:00.447 --> 32:02.328
It's got to be the windows
up there, right?

32:02.415 --> 32:04.854
Are you here?

32:05.285 --> 32:07.315
Just come near us.

32:07.714 --> 32:09.347
Show us
that you're here.

32:13.660 --> 32:14.507
What was that?

32:14.594 --> 32:15.775
What was that?

32:15.862 --> 32:16.876
Did you hear that noise?

32:16.963 --> 32:18.177
It sounded like a woman
going, "hooo."

32:18.264 --> 32:19.879
yes,
like a whimpering sound.

32:19.966 --> 32:21.720
Yes.
I heard that.

32:21.808 --> 32:23.816
That was definitely captured
on this camera.

32:23.903 --> 32:26.252
Did Aaron and Billy
just capture audio evidence

32:26.339 --> 32:28.388
of this woman spirit?

32:28.475 --> 32:30.159
Show us
that you're here.

32:36.449 --> 32:37.330
What was that?

32:37.417 --> 32:38.931
What was that?

32:45.225 --> 32:46.305
I'm coming up.

32:46.392 --> 32:48.041
I decide to make my way upstairs

32:48.128 --> 32:50.565
into the tower
to find the guys.

32:50.797 --> 32:52.812
Maybe we should go down
where the bedroom is,

32:52.899 --> 32:55.615
- where she saw here.
- Zac, are you in the bedroom now?

32:55.702 --> 32:56.845
He's downstairs.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.084
He's not even up here.

33:00.707 --> 33:01.988
Oh, shoot,
we're way up.

33:02.075 --> 33:03.256
He's down another level.

33:03.343 --> 33:04.657
Yeah, he's on a...
Where are you at,

33:04.744 --> 33:06.826
ZAC, just so we know
for reference?

33:06.913 --> 33:07.693
First floor.

33:07.780 --> 33:09.996
Oh, my God!

33:10.083 --> 33:11.464
Oh, whoa!
Did you hear that thing?

33:11.551 --> 33:13.099
Dude, where are we?

33:13.186 --> 33:14.133
In the bedroom.
Bedroom.

33:14.220 --> 33:15.435
This is where she...

33:15.522 --> 33:17.537
Let me put it on the bed.
Hold on.

33:17.624 --> 33:18.571
Oh,
I just got the chills.

33:18.658 --> 33:20.173
So do I.
Whew.

33:20.260 --> 33:22.008
Are you guys all right?

33:22.095 --> 33:25.144
I think that this spirit's
trying to communicate with us.

33:25.231 --> 33:27.613
We heard her voice,
she lit up the geophone.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.882
We put it in the windowsill
where she's seen.

33:29.969 --> 33:32.351
But we just heard a woman
go, "hooo,"

33:32.438 --> 33:35.685
while we were asking
if she's here with us.

33:35.773 --> 33:37.054
What was that?

33:37.374 --> 33:40.156
I think she's trailing us.
I do, too.

33:40.446 --> 33:42.195
I'm not feeling that good,
guys.

33:42.282 --> 33:43.696
No?
You feeling ill?

33:43.783 --> 33:47.867
I'm not feeling, like, affected
or anything, I just feel sick.

33:47.954 --> 33:49.869
As I'm starting to feel
very ill,

33:49.956 --> 33:52.371
I finally make my way up
to meet the guys,

33:52.458 --> 33:55.308
and as Aaron begins using
the direct-linc device,

33:55.395 --> 33:57.810
he receives
this spirit response.

33:57.897 --> 33:59.979
You don't hear any voices
coming out of that at all.

34:00.066 --> 34:01.280
No.

34:03.303 --> 34:04.802
Did it say Jesus?

34:08.675 --> 34:10.123
Did it say Jesus?

34:10.210 --> 34:11.757
What?

34:11.844 --> 34:13.226
What?

34:13.313 --> 34:15.128
Whoa,
this thing just lit up!

34:15.215 --> 34:16.329
This thing just lit up.

34:18.284 --> 34:20.299
What's wrong?

34:20.386 --> 34:21.833
It's lighting up,
it's lighting up.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.069
What's wrong?

34:23.156 --> 34:24.937
Dude, this thing was...
What's wrong with you, dude?

34:25.024 --> 34:26.105
What's getting you?

34:26.192 --> 34:27.572
Zac, what's getting you?
I don't know.

34:27.659 --> 34:29.574
There's someone down
my back.

34:29.661 --> 34:31.913
Is it scratching you?
What is it doing?

34:32.038 --> 34:33.612
Let me look, let me look.
No, I got to get out.

34:33.699 --> 34:34.918
Dude.
Hey, we got to look.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.349
Something just went down
your back?

34:36.436 --> 34:37.283
Yeah, you got to look.

34:37.370 --> 34:38.885
Let me see.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.722
Look at his back.

34:42.809 --> 34:43.822
What is it?
I don't know.

34:43.909 --> 34:44.857
Is that from sitting
in the chair or...

34:44.944 --> 34:46.324
That might not be.

34:46.411 --> 34:47.426
That doesn't look like it.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:47.513 --> 34:48.527
Hold on, let me get off
night vision.

34:48.614 --> 34:49.795
Yeah,
get it off night vision.

34:49.882 --> 34:51.864
Dude, it looks like...
Whoa, it's getting dark.

34:51.951 --> 34:53.099
Dude, look.
Stop.

34:53.186 --> 34:55.333
It's right from here all the way
down to here

34:55.420 --> 34:58.404
is a big long scratch
with another one up on top.

34:58.491 --> 35:00.206
Here, let me take a picture.
Yeah, quick, quick.

35:00.293 --> 35:01.741
You guys,
I just felt something.

35:01.828 --> 35:03.509
Dude,
it went down my shirt.

35:03.596 --> 35:05.678
I felt it on my back.

35:05.765 --> 35:07.280
Was it nails
or something?

35:07.367 --> 35:09.348
No, bro, it was insane.

35:09.435 --> 35:12.903
Right after Aaron receives
this voice saying "am Jesus"...

35:13.706 --> 35:18.391
I begin to feel something on my
back from within my clothing.

35:18.478 --> 35:21.594
Then Billy picks up on spikes
of electromagnetic energy

35:21.681 --> 35:23.863
at the same moment
that this light anomaly

35:23.950 --> 35:25.998
appears to shoot
by the device.

35:26.085 --> 35:28.434
It is then seen coming back
towards me

35:28.521 --> 35:31.304
to add to this
incredible series of events.

35:31.391 --> 35:35.159
Listen to what this female voice
says through the direct-link.

35:40.033 --> 35:43.616
Lastly, as Aaron and Billy
noticed red marks on my back,

35:43.703 --> 35:47.253
they begin to document one
that appears on camera

35:47.340 --> 35:49.155
as it goes down my spine.

35:49.242 --> 35:51.324
What is that going down
my spine?

35:51.411 --> 35:52.758
That's a welt.

35:52.845 --> 35:54.493
I'm watching it right now.
Let's take some more.

35:54.580 --> 35:55.528
Hey, look.

35:55.615 --> 35:56.829
I've been on this
the whole time.

35:56.916 --> 35:59.365
That whole thing is...
Honestly, it felt like a...

35:59.452 --> 36:00.499
<i>Stay positive.</i>

36:00.586 --> 36:02.368
- Stay positive!
- Stay positive!

36:02.455 --> 36:03.669
What the hell?!

36:03.756 --> 36:06.205
It was a woman and she
just said, "stay positive."

36:06.292 --> 36:07.707
and it has been talking.

36:07.794 --> 36:09.008
Dude,
it's just been static.

36:09.095 --> 36:10.676
Oh, God.
Feel that.

36:10.763 --> 36:12.144
Oh, my God,
you're freezing.

36:12.231 --> 36:13.279
You're freezing cold.

36:13.366 --> 36:15.681
Look at the chills.
I am so chilled up.

36:15.768 --> 36:17.049
She said,
"stay positive."

36:17.136 --> 36:18.884
just on this side.
It's only on this side.

36:18.971 --> 36:20.219
What are these scratches
right here?

36:20.306 --> 36:21.387
I don't know.
You didn't do that, did you?

36:21.474 --> 36:23.489
No.
What are those scratches?

36:23.576 --> 36:24.957
I don't know!

36:27.547 --> 36:30.363
She just said, "stay positive,"
did you hear that?

36:30.450 --> 36:31.530
Yes.

36:31.617 --> 36:34.051
Honestly, it felt like a...

36:35.254 --> 36:36.569
It felt...

36:36.656 --> 36:38.304
- What?!
- Stay positive!

36:38.391 --> 36:40.740
As I begin vocalizing
my negativity

36:40.827 --> 36:42.341
for what is happening to me,

36:42.428 --> 36:45.378
this female spirit
tells me to stay positive.

36:45.465 --> 36:48.180
I believe she is helping me
to stop fueling

36:48.267 --> 36:52.485
whatever negative entity is
trying to feed off of my anger.

36:52.572 --> 36:55.087
This needle was dancing
all over the place.

36:55.174 --> 36:56.455
It might be up here
with us.

36:56.542 --> 36:58.298
- Whoa!
- On cue.

37:04.384 --> 37:07.600
As I'm dealing with having
just been attacked in the tower

37:07.687 --> 37:11.203
at Albion Castle,
we receive a message.

37:11.290 --> 37:12.471
<i>Stay positive.</i>
What?!

37:12.558 --> 37:14.073
- Stay positive!
- Stay positive!

37:14.160 --> 37:15.541
What the hell?

37:15.628 --> 37:17.176
Did you hear her say,
"stay positive"?

37:17.263 --> 37:18.444
Stay positive.

37:18.531 --> 37:19.812
Stay positive.
Like, stay positive.

37:19.899 --> 37:21.180
As I was freaking out.

37:21.267 --> 37:22.448
Like, you're gonna get
through this,

37:22.535 --> 37:25.184
but you just had
an experience... stay positive.

37:25.271 --> 37:27.186
I'm still feeling it
down my back.

37:27.273 --> 37:28.988
Like, I still feel like
I'm being touched,

37:29.075 --> 37:30.456
but it doesn't hurt.

37:30.543 --> 37:33.726
It doesn't feel burn-y,
it doesn't feel like anything.

37:33.813 --> 37:34.994
Tell us something else.

37:35.081 --> 37:36.081
What else you got?

37:37.583 --> 37:38.764
- Whoa!
- On cue?

37:38.851 --> 37:39.799
What did it just say?

37:39.886 --> 37:41.267
I thought it said,
"on your back."

37:41.354 --> 37:43.703
yeah, that's what
I thought it said.

37:43.790 --> 37:44.970
Tell us something else.

37:45.057 --> 37:46.223
What else you got?

37:47.727 --> 37:49.093
What else you got?

37:50.029 --> 37:51.744
- Whoa!
- On cue.

37:51.831 --> 37:52.678
Lay back on the bed.

37:52.765 --> 37:54.046
It was doing good
on the bed

37:54.133 --> 37:55.915
'cause that's the bed
that she saw the spirit.

37:56.002 --> 37:57.516
Zac, you...
Oh, wait.

37:57.603 --> 37:59.752
I had three clothes on.

37:59.839 --> 38:00.986
I had three.

38:01.073 --> 38:05.624
I had a thermal, a long hoodie,
and a jacket.

38:05.711 --> 38:07.426
Yeah, there's no way.
Zac, you should hold this.

38:07.513 --> 38:09.161
This room, dude.
I'm telling you, this room.

38:09.248 --> 38:13.065
What is it you want
to say so bad?

38:13.152 --> 38:14.834
Oh, I just caught
an anomaly coming...

38:14.921 --> 38:16.469
Who just touched me?

38:16.556 --> 38:18.003
There was a huge anomaly
just came down.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.106
What was that?
What did that mean?

38:23.229 --> 38:24.276
- What?!
- Christ!

38:24.363 --> 38:25.311
Something about christ.

38:25.398 --> 38:27.046
Those are crystal clear.

38:27.133 --> 38:30.649
Again, watch how remarkable
this evidence is.

38:30.736 --> 38:32.351
The light anomaly manifests

38:32.438 --> 38:35.121
right over
the direct-link device

38:35.208 --> 38:39.877
just before this man comes
through and says, "what christ?"

38:43.249 --> 38:44.430
something about christ.

38:44.517 --> 38:46.799
And remember, earlier, this man
came through

38:46.886 --> 38:48.819
and mentioned Jesus.

38:51.891 --> 38:54.173
What don't you like?

38:54.260 --> 38:55.408
Huh?
Do you know us?

38:55.495 --> 38:57.777
Can you say one of our names?

39:01.067 --> 39:02.548
Jay, come in.

39:02.635 --> 39:03.849
Go ahead, Zac.

39:03.936 --> 39:07.219
I don't want any of us
to leave this position

39:07.306 --> 39:08.687
that we're in right now
in case

39:08.774 --> 39:11.724
we're greeting some form of
triangle of energy or something.

39:11.811 --> 39:13.325
I need you to grab
the sls.

39:13.412 --> 39:16.829
I need you to bring it up
to the tower right now.

39:16.916 --> 39:19.049
Copy that.
Coming right over.

39:20.953 --> 39:23.436
And the responses,
"stay positive,"

39:23.523 --> 39:25.171
all that
was just amazing.

39:25.258 --> 39:26.605
I've never heard
anything like that.

39:26.692 --> 39:29.008
It was like we were talking to
the dead and they figured it out

39:29.095 --> 39:31.977
and we figured it out
at the same time.

39:32.064 --> 39:35.181
When I felt that on my back,
it didn't feel bad,

39:35.548 --> 39:37.383
it just scared me.

39:37.470 --> 39:41.120
Are you on the stairs?

39:41.207 --> 39:44.775
Can you show yourself where
you touched me on the back?

39:47.513 --> 39:49.128
You startled me.

39:49.215 --> 39:50.463
I am staying positive.

39:50.550 --> 39:52.965
I'm not gonna go negative.

39:53.052 --> 39:57.636
It did scare me because I don't
know what was touching me.

39:57.723 --> 39:59.356
Can you show yourself?

40:01.360 --> 40:03.209
Might be up here with us,
on this level.

40:03.296 --> 40:04.569
Okay, nobody move.

40:04.657 --> 40:07.368
Stay right where you're at.

40:07.667 --> 40:09.181
Is this your bed?

40:15.374 --> 40:17.022
Man, that was intense.

40:17.109 --> 40:19.058
Like you said, Zac,
that was historical.

40:19.145 --> 40:22.761
That was like them figuring out
there was a communication open.

40:22.848 --> 40:25.297
We got something weird.

40:25.384 --> 40:27.266
As I'm aiming the camera
down the stairs,

40:27.353 --> 40:31.036
we make our only capture on
sls the entire night...

40:31.123 --> 40:34.206
What appears to be
a strange disfigured anomaly.

40:34.293 --> 40:36.175
Immediately
after this capture,

40:36.262 --> 40:39.011
I use the trifield meter
and begin to document

40:39.098 --> 40:43.015
some extremely abnormal spikes
of electromagnetic energy.

40:43.102 --> 40:45.084
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

40:45.171 --> 40:46.218
What?
Whoa.

40:46.305 --> 40:47.887
Oh, my God.
What?

40:47.974 --> 40:52.224
Aaron, get a light on so
we can look at this meter.

40:52.311 --> 40:53.492
Whoa.
Wow.

40:53.579 --> 40:55.261
Whoa!

40:55.348 --> 40:57.596
See, now it stopped.
No way.

40:57.683 --> 40:59.231
You caught it though, right?
Oh, yeah.

40:59.318 --> 41:00.366
I saw it.
I saw it.

41:00.453 --> 41:02.601
You see that this is not
doing anything now?

41:02.688 --> 41:07.306
I have not moved or adjusted
the positioning of my camera

41:07.393 --> 41:09.208
or the trifield meter.

41:09.295 --> 41:12.912
This is unexplainable science
right now.

41:12.999 --> 41:16.448
Moments ago, it was spiking
all over the place...

41:16.535 --> 41:20.019
Spikes of
electromagnetic energy,

41:20.106 --> 41:22.421
and I have not changed
the positioning

41:22.508 --> 41:24.857
of the trifield meter
and my camera.

41:24.944 --> 41:26.358
My arms have been the same.

41:26.445 --> 41:27.526
I have not moved these.

41:27.613 --> 41:29.361
I'm just swaying
back and forth,

41:29.448 --> 41:32.898
and this needle was dancing
all over the place.

41:32.985 --> 41:34.667
It's almost like it passed
right through you.

41:34.754 --> 41:37.503
It came through here
and it's gone.

41:44.430 --> 41:45.878
Fueled by sacred water...

41:45.965 --> 41:48.681
Can you come out of the water
like you have before?

41:48.768 --> 41:51.483
...The darkness here
is powerful...

41:51.570 --> 41:53.052
That's a welt.

41:53.139 --> 41:54.787
...And we are
forever stained...

41:54.874 --> 41:56.455
What's wrong?
I don't know!

41:56.542 --> 41:59.143
...By this ominous
and historic castle.
