00:06.000 --> 00:09.200
The producers would like to thank -

00:09.280 --> 00:14.040
- the families of the missing persons
for making this film possible.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.960
On November 26, 2011, a film crew
was reported missing in northern Sweden.

00:24.960 --> 00:30.160
After 10 days, the Swedish police
called off the search.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.680
A year later, the Swedish Intelligence
Service was hacked by "Anonymous".

00:38.640 --> 00:45.800
Soon after, an unknown source published
the data from the crew's laptop online.

00:46.880 --> 00:51.560
This is the crew's footage.

00:54.320 --> 01:00.080
Sweden, 320 miles north of Copenhagen.
Friday, November 18, 2011. 11:16 AM.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.680
- You're making a mess.
- What are you looking for?

01:06.840 --> 01:10.160
I'm looking for a pen.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.560
Why are you filming this?

01:13.720 --> 01:17.760
It's "Behind the Scenes".
Alex, grab the other camera.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.040
- Then give it to me.
- It's in the back.

01:23.640 --> 01:26.680
Here we go.
Hey, how's it going up front?

01:26.840 --> 01:29.600
In "Behind the Scenes"
you ask people -

01:29.760 --> 01:33.240
- how the movie was made,
but we haven't started yet.

01:33.400 --> 01:39.360
Shut up, Anders. We're doing "Behind
the Scenes". Janne, let's do it.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.320
- Say something.
- Say something?

01:42.480 --> 01:45.960
- Talk about your first horse.
- My first horse?

01:46.120 --> 01:49.880
- I mean talk about yourself.
- What do you want to know?

01:50.040 --> 01:51.840
Oh, come on...

01:52.000 --> 01:56.200
Well, I'm an actress and...

01:56.360 --> 02:00.440
- We're almost out of licorice.
- I've done commercials...

02:00.600 --> 02:04.000
- We have lots more.
- Are you even interested?

02:04.160 --> 02:06.720
- Yes, go on.
- No one wants to hear that shit.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.240
You've done commercials.
How old are you? Where did you train?

02:11.400 --> 02:15.560
- Your turn then.
- I'm Alex. I'm 27 and I'm an actor.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.080
- What's this Oprah crap?
- Copenhagen, Denmark.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.600
Perfect!
Copenhagen, Denmark.

02:21.760 --> 02:27.400
She's mad because she didn't
get to talk about her ballet school.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.360
Can you stretch your leg
all the way up?

02:30.520 --> 02:34.720
- I'm not saying anything.
- But you just did.

02:34.880 --> 02:39.360
- The silent treatment.
- Anders? It's you.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.600
- Yes. What's me?
- Yes, exactly. What are you?

02:43.760 --> 02:47.800
- You should film him.
- I'm the director of the film.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.520
How old are you?

02:50.680 --> 02:57.400
Yes, that's the only relevant question
right now. You're ridiculous.

02:57.560 --> 03:00.440
Give me that thing.
It's your turn now.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.960
- Three, two, go!
- What am I doing?

03:04.120 --> 03:06.800
Just say what I just said.
How old are you?

03:06.960 --> 03:11.760
I'm the director and I'm 35.
That's what you said!

03:11.920 --> 03:14.440
Okay, Superman,
What's your job?

03:14.600 --> 03:16.800
Cameraman and editor.

03:16.960 --> 03:21.520
Look. I want to show you
something on the iPad.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.960
- Yes, that's nice.
- It's the film's logo.

03:25.120 --> 03:31.400
No way.
It took two minutes to make.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.520
It's nice how the "O"
is bigger than the others.

03:34.680 --> 03:39.720
- Anders, it should be a sci-fi.
- No, it's a horror film.

03:39.880 --> 03:44.040
Mikael, put on some music.
Track number nine.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.920
I need the bathroom soon.
That licorice runs right through me.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.560
This track is so awesome.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.400
- Is it yours?
- Yes, it's for the film.

03:55.560 --> 03:59.640
- It's Mikael's and mine.
- You made it? It sounds good.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.120
- Can you do ballet to that, Janne?
- Easily.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.400
When do we get to a restaurant?

04:07.400 --> 04:10.320
Aren't you hungry?

04:10.480 --> 04:14.840
I'm starving. I'll go into a coma
if I don't eat soon.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.520
This fish is really dry.

04:23.680 --> 04:28.200
- What do you think of my steady cam?
- It looks very steady.

04:28.360 --> 04:34.360
Here, take it. You want "Behind
the Scenes" to be awesome, don't you?

04:34.520 --> 04:37.520
No, I'm eating right now.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.360
Where the hell
did you get that steady cam?

04:40.520 --> 04:44.200
- I bought it.
- You bought it?

04:44.360 --> 04:48.440
- Well, technically you bought it.
- How many cameras did you buy?

04:48.600 --> 04:51.160
- Three.
- Are you serious?

04:51.320 --> 04:56.640
Three cameras and a steady cam...
Do you think I have gold up my ass?

04:56.800 --> 05:01.240
- What were you thinking?
- You told me to get proper equipment.

05:01.400 --> 05:05.720
Are you going to come by
and film me when I get evicted too?

05:05.880 --> 05:09.760
- Shut up.
- How does it work?

05:09.920 --> 05:14.760
These weights provide balance
so it can be moved smoothly.

05:14.920 --> 05:20.400
Stanley Kubrick uses them.
The balance is still off, jerkwad.

05:20.560 --> 05:24.200
- It's your balance that's off.
- Can I try?

05:24.360 --> 05:30.160
You're good at that, Janne.
Maybe you should be "camera ass".

05:30.320 --> 05:33.400
- You're so lame.
- That's what it's called.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.120
"Camera ass"? What's your
favorite horror film, Fjord?

05:37.280 --> 05:40.640
- Let's guess.
- It starts with an "A".

05:40.800 --> 05:44.240
- It's Alien.
- Alien is sci-fi.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.960
- You can zoom too.
- Yes, I got it.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.280
What if you had to choose a horror
movie that wasn't made in the 80s?

05:52.440 --> 05:56.040
I don't want to.
It's all crappy action nowadays.

05:56.200 --> 05:59.800
There has to be something.
The Blair Witch Project?

05:59.960 --> 06:04.320
Blair Witch?
I like the idea, but not the execution.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.200
What idea is that?

06:06.360 --> 06:10.640
The director tried to scare
the actors, but it didn't work.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.280
I just want to apologize...

06:17.480 --> 06:19.360
I'm so scared.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.720
- You're spitting on the camera.
- Relax. Take it then.

06:22.880 --> 06:26.040
- Have you seen Blair Witch?
- No, I haven't.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.440
- Can I interview you?
- God damn it, Fjord.

06:29.600 --> 06:34.040
- What's your favorite horror film?
- We can't use it.

06:34.200 --> 06:38.040
Hey, relax!

06:38.200 --> 06:43.320
You're the one who got me
that shrimp salad burger.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.520
We were just talking about movies.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.240
About The Blair Witch Project!
They'll figure it out!

06:54.400 --> 06:57.120
No, they won't.

06:57.280 --> 07:01.240
- What's up, girls?
- Hey, Fjord. Where are the others?

07:01.400 --> 07:04.320
- Janne is still in there.
- I need the bathroom.

07:04.480 --> 07:08.040
Anders?
Take a look.

07:08.200 --> 07:12.360
- Did you make another poop film?
- Just look.

07:12.520 --> 07:16.480
Alex and Janne borrowed
the camera to rehearse the scene.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.160
Oh, Alex... Alex...

07:21.320 --> 07:24.200
Oh, come on.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.280
- It's not funny, Fjord!
- Why not?

07:27.440 --> 07:32.040
- It goes on for five minutes.
- Fetch the others.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.800
- Is it a problem?
- I don't know.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.160
"Encounters".
It sounds like a sci-fi.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.440
But it's not.
It's horror.

07:44.600 --> 07:48.440
It should be called "Invaders".

07:48.600 --> 07:52.400
Like "Space Invaders"?

07:52.560 --> 07:55.040
"Invaders of the Sixth Kind".

07:55.200 --> 07:58.760
That means you interact with aliens
and then they kill you.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.320
Some people believe
there's also a Seventh Kind.

08:02.480 --> 08:09.160
That's when you interact with aliens
and then give birth to their offspring.

08:09.320 --> 08:12.040
- So you fuck an alien?
- You fornicate with one.

08:12.200 --> 08:17.040
- "Alien Fornication".
- Maybe we should call the film that.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.080
It's not my fault
I have a tiny bladder.

08:37.240 --> 08:41.480
- Do you know where we are, Anders?
- I don't have service.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.240
Me neither.
I just have one tiny bar.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.960
Yes, we saw that in the home video
you left on the camera.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.720
A tiny bar.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.600
Calm down, man.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.280
- You're not serious.
- It's ready for YouPorn.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.400
Go take a piss, Superman.

09:02.560 --> 09:06.600
We can't have your willie
in "Behind the Scenes".

09:36.960 --> 09:39.840
I'm sorry, Janne.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.480
I'm sorry.
No one was supposed to see it.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.640
- Would you close the door?
- Sure.

09:52.120 --> 09:55.040
Oh, shit! Wait!

09:56.560 --> 09:59.600
Come on, man!
Wait!

09:59.760 --> 10:04.840
Stop, stop, stop...
Let him catch up to us.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.560
And go.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.640
- Are you going to erase it then?
- Yes, I will.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.120
Hold this
so I can get my pants on.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.800
- Oh, dude.
- Very funny.

10:43.840 --> 10:48.720
- Why are we going all the way up here?
- Come on, Mikael, don't do that.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.440
Are we almost there?

10:51.600 --> 10:55.200
Alex, can I borrow your phone?
I promised to text my mom.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.840
Aww, you're texting mom.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.360
- Chill out, Sarah Linden.
- Did you want to borrow it or not?

11:02.520 --> 11:06.360
Mireille Enos wants
her woolen sweater back.

11:06.520 --> 11:10.160
- The GPS isn't working.
- What are you talking about?

11:10.320 --> 11:15.120
Look, it's flickering.
We should be there now.

11:15.280 --> 11:18.120
No, it said we'd arrive in 10 minutes.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.720
- Did you break the GPS?
- Chill out, man.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.720
What the hell?

11:32.880 --> 11:37.960
- Oh, sorry to wake you up.
- Were you sleeping?

11:38.120 --> 11:40.880
- What's going on?
- Why are we stopping?

11:41.040 --> 11:45.200
- There's some guy on the road.
- Wait, don't move.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.160
- He's not moving.
- Man, he's creepy.

11:48.320 --> 11:52.480
Drive around.
Why is he just standing there?

11:52.640 --> 11:55.880
- Get him on film!
- Are you okay? Are you alone?

11:56.040 --> 11:57.360
Zoom in on him.

11:57.520 --> 12:01.120
He's Swedish,
he doesn't know what's going on.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.680
Alex, don't leave the car.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.880
- There's something wrong with him.
- Just stay in the car.

12:08.040 --> 12:11.680
- He's super creepy.
- Just drive around.

12:11.840 --> 12:15.200
He's a scary motherfucker.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.680
Fuck, he's scary.

12:19.720 --> 12:24.440
You got him, right?
He has to be in the film.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.720
He must have been drunk.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.360
Oh, man...

12:38.480 --> 12:41.200
Are you all right, Janne?

12:42.680 --> 12:47.760
I feel bad about just driving away.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.040
We had to get away from there.

12:50.200 --> 12:54.440
He made his way out there,
so he can find his way home too.

12:54.600 --> 13:01.560
He's one of those hermits who lives
in the woods and eats his own feces.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.960
Bye!

13:06.120 --> 13:08.240
- When will they be back?
- In three days.

13:08.400 --> 13:14.320
- Anders, it's getting dark already.
- That's why we have to get going.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.480
Wait for me, wait for me.

13:31.680 --> 13:37.000
I'm guessing that the lake is here...

13:37.160 --> 13:40.320
Over there.
I just can't see shit.

13:40.480 --> 13:44.120
- Is this it?
- Yes.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.680
- Are you lost?
- No.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.880
We're just looking at the map.
Hand me the GPS.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.720
There's nothing there.

14:00.880 --> 14:03.840
- Get it out, Fjord.
- Get what out?

14:04.000 --> 14:07.960
- Come on, it's on your list.
- No, wait a second...

14:08.120 --> 14:10.320
- Fjord, I'm not in the mood.
- Hold on.

14:10.480 --> 14:16.240
My list said
cameras, batteries, maps...

14:18.480 --> 14:23.320
- Did you forget it?
- No, because it wasn't mine to bring.

14:23.480 --> 14:28.280
You fucking forgot the GPS.
What's wrong with you, Fjord?

14:28.440 --> 14:32.600
Huh? What the hell are you doing?
Do you know where we are?

14:33.880 --> 14:37.720
We're 120 miles
into the Swedish woods.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.720
- We'll get lost without that GPS.
- Relax!

14:40.880 --> 14:43.880
I can't believe this.

14:44.040 --> 14:48.560
- Does anyone have a GPS phone?
- Calm down, I have GPS on my phone.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.440
Here, Anders. Take the map.

14:51.600 --> 14:56.080
Just a moment.
It can't download the map.

14:56.240 --> 15:02.280
- They don't work without internet.
- That's why we needed the other one.

15:03.800 --> 15:06.320
Okay, listen. Be quiet.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.680
We'll set up a camp here.

15:09.840 --> 15:14.360
We'll look at the map again tomorrow.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.600
- Anders, do you know where we're going?
- Yes.

15:18.760 --> 15:23.240
- Great.
- There was no GPS on my list.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.040
- Ow!
- Just hold on.

15:34.200 --> 15:39.160
Don't worry, Anders, we're saved.
Janne has the map. It's perfect.

15:39.320 --> 15:45.160
But seriously, we're 370 miles into
Sweden and we've walked 10 miles.

15:45.320 --> 15:50.400
- That's pretty accurate.
- We'll find it tomorrow.

15:50.560 --> 15:55.680
We'll find the location
with the lake and start filming.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.680
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting the whiskey.

15:59.840 --> 16:06.440
No way. We're lost, we can't have you
running around drunk in the woods.

16:06.600 --> 16:11.680
- Just give me a little bit.
- No, you're not getting any.

16:19.080 --> 16:23.480
- Anders?
- Shut up, man.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.280
Anders?

16:26.440 --> 16:29.600
Anders, do you hear that?

16:30.800 --> 16:33.920
Anders?
Did you hear that noise?

16:35.720 --> 16:38.080
No.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.720
Fjord's scary noises:
Take one.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.840
Okay, Fjord.
What did you hear?

17:52.920 --> 17:55.880
- I don't know.
- He can't hear anything.

17:56.040 --> 18:02.480
- You're chewing really loudly.
- Is that it?

18:02.640 --> 18:06.960
- Maybe it was a moose.
- No, this is how a moose sounds.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.880
- What does a goat sound like?
- Well, they....

18:11.040 --> 18:15.560
You guys are idiots.
No, I don't want any of that.

18:15.720 --> 18:21.760
Janne, you should interview Anders.
Like we talked about in the restaurant.

18:21.920 --> 18:26.680
- Anders? How about an interview?
- Not a chance.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.400
So, Anders...

18:33.640 --> 18:38.920
So, why do we have to go
so far north to shoot these scenes?

18:39.080 --> 18:42.400
- I don't want to do this.
- Sit down, I can't film you!

18:42.560 --> 18:48.240
- No, I'm done. We have to get going.
- Why did we have to come here?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.680
Let's just go.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.480
I can't find the scary stuff.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.640
- It's in the Encounters folder.
- No, I checked.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.640
Anders?
I still need more nature shots.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.040
- You have two minutes.
- Three! No, it takes 20.

19:08.200 --> 19:12.160
- Two minutes.
- We need them for editing.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.200
You can pack my things for me.

19:21.200 --> 19:25.480
Hello there...

19:26.480 --> 19:29.000
That's a good nature shot.

19:30.480 --> 19:35.800
Turn around.
Turn around for Daddy.

19:35.960 --> 19:39.200
You're so cute when
you're washing yourself.

19:40.400 --> 19:45.040
Oh yes...
No, lose the towel.

19:45.200 --> 19:49.240
What are you doing, you pig?
Are you filming her?

19:49.400 --> 19:55.720
- No, I'm just getting some footage.
- Weren't you getting beauty shots?

19:55.880 --> 19:59.640
- I have a beauty shot right here.
- Get to work.

19:59.800 --> 20:04.400
All right.
I'll be right back.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.240
Are you shooting?

20:26.400 --> 20:30.440
Oh no,
I'm just doing some frame tests.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.200
I was wondering,
if it hadn't been Alex -

20:34.360 --> 20:39.240
- could something have happened
between you and me instead?

20:39.400 --> 20:42.640
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

20:42.800 --> 20:47.280
- If you weren't so annoying.
- I'm not annoying!

20:47.440 --> 20:50.560
Are you and Alex going to have kids?

20:54.400 --> 20:56.880
I don't know.

21:01.440 --> 21:05.800
- Where are Anders and Alex?
- They're talking about the scene.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.760
I want to talk about it too.

21:11.160 --> 21:16.680
Look, you can't be with Janne.
It's just going to fuck everything up.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.800
No, it'll create more drama.

21:18.960 --> 21:23.440
No, I'm worried about her.
She's so fragile.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.720
- And you know what to do?
- Yes, I've got this.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.640
- Stick to the plan.
- Of course.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.000
- What the hell are you doing, Fjord?
- Huh?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.760
- What are you doing?
- I needed the bathroom.

21:36.920 --> 21:41.640
Are you pooping right now?

21:41.800 --> 21:47.520
That's fucking disgusting.
Go shoot your film somewhere else.

21:47.680 --> 21:51.200
I'll just go poop somewhere else.

21:57.000 --> 22:02.600
Shit... Anders, does Sweden
share a border with Alaska?

22:02.760 --> 22:06.800
- It's just a shower; it'll pass.
- Come on, Fjord.

22:09.040 --> 22:13.160
Anders, there's a lake right here!

22:14.320 --> 22:15.640
Listen...

22:15.800 --> 22:22.040
Anders spent two months planning
and finding the perfect lake for this.

22:25.240 --> 22:29.000
There are mushrooms here.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.880
- Come on!
- There are mushrooms!

22:36.760 --> 22:38.240
Let's go, Fjord!

22:39.640 --> 22:44.840
- That lake...
- This map sucks. I give up.

22:46.240 --> 22:50.280
- I can't figure it out.
- Hey, stop it.

22:53.640 --> 22:58.480
I'm exhausted.
Can't we take a break and get warm?

22:58.640 --> 23:01.600
Let's go hide in a tent.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.880
- A tent won't be much warmer.
- Let's keep going.

23:05.040 --> 23:09.200
- We're getting soaked.
- It's better to keep moving.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.920
Are you loving it, Janne?

23:17.640 --> 23:22.280
Anders, this is the same fucking lake.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.920
- It's the same lake.
- We'll film here.

23:32.080 --> 23:38.200
What? When we left, you thought
filming here was the worst idea ever.

23:38.360 --> 23:44.320
- Now suddenly it's a great idea?
- I can't find the lake without a GPS.

23:44.480 --> 23:48.160
All right,
let's have the GPS-talk again.

23:48.320 --> 23:52.160
The light looks good.
Let's do it here.

23:52.320 --> 23:55.440
As long as I get to sit down.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.440
Ice crystals! Freeze!

23:58.600 --> 24:03.600
- What did you correct?
- It's just a few changes.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.320
It's going to be great.

24:05.480 --> 24:10.560
Perfect.
Here are the costumes.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.960
They look expensive.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.880
Well, it's a low-budget film.

24:17.040 --> 24:22.600
- Do you want cameras in the trees?
- Don't put cameras in the trees.

24:22.760 --> 24:27.360
Just focus on what I asked you to do.
We don't need any of that.

24:27.520 --> 24:31.880
- Focus on your job.
- How much did you want to keep?

24:32.040 --> 24:36.880
Some of it seems a bit far-fetched.
I have some ideas I'd like to share.

24:37.040 --> 24:41.640
Anders, let's rehearse the new
scenes before we lose the light.

24:41.800 --> 24:47.520
- Anders?
- We don't have time to rehearse.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.200
But we need to do
the corrected scenes.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.440
- Camera is rolling.
- Action.

25:00.440 --> 25:03.840
- I know he is out there.
- Dearest Maria, there is nothing.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.240
I can feel it. We are lost.
It is too late.

25:07.400 --> 25:11.360
It is all in your head.

25:11.520 --> 25:16.920
I sense that you know I am right.
This was no coincidence.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.160
Just calm down.

25:19.320 --> 25:22.360
We cannot sleep,
he will kill us in our dreams.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.440
- Janne...
- Maria.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.720
- I'm sorry.
- Just keep going.

25:28.880 --> 25:32.280
- Isn't that Nightmare on Elm Street?
- Shut up, Fjord.

25:37.040 --> 25:41.680
- What is this?
- If you read it, you will die.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.720
You must get another person
to read it, so they die instead of you.

25:50.360 --> 25:54.120
How on earth did a letter
get into the woods?

25:54.280 --> 25:57.880
- With the postal service.
- Shut up.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.720
Ridiculous.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.280
Listen.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.880
- It is just our dog.
- That is not our dog.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.080
It is a dog from hell.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.640
Action.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.240
- Do you know how heavy this is?
- Right. Let's go.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.320
Let's get to the zombie dog.

26:21.480 --> 26:26.920
You say that it's our dog.
I'm waiting for your line.

26:27.080 --> 26:30.320
I can't go if you don't say
that it's our dog.

26:30.480 --> 26:33.120
Alex, please...

26:33.280 --> 26:38.120
- What's going on?
- What the fuck is that?

26:38.280 --> 26:41.400
- Could it be headlights?
- There aren't any roads here.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.600
- There aren't any cars here.
- That's freaky.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.600
- Give me the camera.
- What are you doing?

26:47.760 --> 26:51.320
- I want to film it.
- What do you think I'm doing?

26:51.480 --> 26:54.080
Hello?

26:54.240 --> 26:56.880
Come on, Fjord.

26:57.040 --> 27:02.480
Alex, wait.
I have to get the steady cam off.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.560
Oh, shit...
Ouch!

27:30.920 --> 27:34.680
- What the hell is it?
- Can you see it?

27:34.840 --> 27:40.720
I can't see shit.
But that light is moving around.

27:53.800 --> 27:59.320
Alex?

28:01.120 --> 28:03.560
Damn it, Alex.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.240
Hello?

28:07.360 --> 28:09.560
Hello?

28:13.960 --> 28:17.440
- What's going on?
- Alex?

28:17.600 --> 28:20.560
Point the beam over there.

28:23.280 --> 28:27.760
What are you doing?
What was with that light?

28:27.920 --> 28:33.400
Alex and Anders
are just fucking with us.

28:33.560 --> 28:37.800
Oh, it's so dangerous.
The only clue is his shoe.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.680
I heard Anders and Alex
talking about Blair Witch.

28:40.840 --> 28:45.440
- What are you talking about?
- Why would they do that?

28:45.600 --> 28:52.200
Because they want some real
reaction shots for their little movie.

28:52.360 --> 28:55.080
How could I shine
those lights from here?

28:55.240 --> 28:58.080
It's not that hard to shine a light.

28:58.240 --> 29:02.120
It was moving, you idiot!
I had nothing to do with it!

29:02.280 --> 29:06.040
- Then why did I only find his shoe?
- I don't know!

29:06.200 --> 29:08.920
- Can't we call him?
- Yes.

29:09.080 --> 29:13.560
- Does anyone have service?
- I had one bar before.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.160
It's ringing.

29:16.320 --> 29:20.160
I can't hear anything.
Put it on speaker phone.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.800
- Hello?
- Alex?

29:34.960 --> 29:38.760
- Cut it out, Alex.
- Alex?

29:43.560 --> 29:48.000
If his phone is ringing
somewhere, we can find him.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.960
If we split up
we can cover a larger area.

29:51.120 --> 29:55.880
- All right, stop, stop.
- We'll call him and follow the sound.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.960
- We're not splitting up.
- We have walkie-talkies.

29:59.120 --> 30:03.360
- I'm not going back out there.
- You'll have a flashlight.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.920
We'll follow the sound of the phone.

30:07.080 --> 30:11.080
If we split up we can cover more
ground. We have the walkie-talkies.

30:11.240 --> 30:15.240
- This is like a bad horror movie.
- Well, what do you want to do?

30:15.400 --> 30:18.080
I want to wait here
until he comes back.

30:18.240 --> 30:23.480
He might be lost out there.
There are bears and wolves and shit.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.640
So, he's injured and his shoe
is just lying there?

30:26.800 --> 30:30.720
- Yes, maybe he fell.
- Fine, then give me a walkie-talkie.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.720
You're so ridiculous, Fjord.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.880
Alex?

30:50.640 --> 30:54.480
Keep calling him.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.160
Hey, are you still calling him?

31:07.320 --> 31:10.120
I'm calling him constantly.

31:13.360 --> 31:16.200
Anders, I can't hear you.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.640
- Can you hear anything?
- No.

31:25.040 --> 31:28.720
- Anders, stop messing around.
- Fuckwad.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.240
Hey, are you still calling him?

31:37.400 --> 31:40.720
I'm calling him constantly.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.960
Alex?

31:50.640 --> 31:53.560
-There's something here.
- Say that again.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.680
I hear something over here.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.520
Did you find him?

32:16.200 --> 32:20.760
It's his phone.
What the hell is going on?

32:21.760 --> 32:23.920
Alex?

32:25.520 --> 32:27.720
He's not here.

32:29.600 --> 32:33.480
Jesus...

32:36.680 --> 32:39.000
I think we should call for help.

32:39.160 --> 32:44.640
And have them fly out here because
our friend is fucking with us?

32:44.800 --> 32:48.240
- Are you paying the bill?
- Don't you care?

32:48.400 --> 32:50.720
I'm done.
No one listens to me anyway.

32:50.880 --> 32:55.880
Let's just go to bed.
We'll find him tomorrow.

32:56.040 --> 33:00.240
I'll set up the camera
to film the weird lights.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.760
- So we're just going to go to bed?
- What can we do?

33:03.920 --> 33:09.440
Run around in the freezing forest?
We can't see shit.

34:15.360 --> 34:19.920
- It's Alex.
- No, wait.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.520
Anders?

34:23.639 --> 34:27.000
No, Janne, don't.
Don't go out there.

34:27.159 --> 34:30.320
- Don't go out there, Janne.
- It's him, Fjord.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.520
Alex, what are you doing?
Anders! Come out here!

34:35.679 --> 34:39.280
- What's going on?
- Alex is here.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
Alex? Hey? Hello?

34:45.159 --> 34:50.639
Put him in recovery position!
Anders, is this some kind of joke?

34:50.800 --> 34:54.320
For God's sake, help me!
Don't just stand there!

34:56.199 --> 35:01.280
Anders, are you in on this?
What were you two talking about?

35:01.440 --> 35:04.920
Anders, tell the truth right now!

35:05.080 --> 35:10.000
Yes, he was supposed
to disappear and shine some lights!

35:10.160 --> 35:14.040
This isn't part of the plan!
What do you think I am?

35:14.200 --> 35:19.160
- You wanted us to be scared shitless!
- You were supposed to film it!

35:19.320 --> 35:22.640
- How did you know I would film it?
- I know you!

35:22.800 --> 35:25.080
Shut up!

35:27.360 --> 35:33.320
- It's making strange noises again.
- Put it on speaker phone.

35:34.520 --> 35:37.200
Hello?

35:37.360 --> 35:40.120
What the hell are those noises?

35:40.280 --> 35:43.320
Hello?

35:43.480 --> 35:48.400
- Janne, there's no one there.
- There must be someone!

35:48.560 --> 35:51.000
And now it's dead.

35:51.160 --> 35:54.040
- Janne, take the camera.
- Help me, Fjord.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.040
Oh, no...

36:11.200 --> 36:13.120
Are you pregnant?

36:13.280 --> 36:15.760
Maybe it's something I ate.
Go away.

36:15.920 --> 36:22.000
I asked you about the mushrooms.
I'm having stomach problems too.

36:22.160 --> 36:26.160
- I ate half the pot of soup and I'm fine.
- That's great, Fjord.

36:27.240 --> 36:31.120
Is Alex awake, Janne?

36:31.280 --> 36:35.480
- Is Alex awake?
- He was awake last night.

36:36.480 --> 36:40.200
Alex?

36:41.200 --> 36:43.520
Oh! Alex?

36:43.680 --> 36:45.760
Janne?
You said he was awake.

36:45.920 --> 36:49.520
- Yes, he was awake last night.
- He's totally gone.

36:49.680 --> 36:52.600
What the fuck did he say?

36:52.760 --> 36:56.000
What did he say when he woke up?

36:56.160 --> 36:58.800
He must have said something.

36:58.960 --> 37:02.880
Jesus, that's disgusting.
It's completely rotten.

37:04.720 --> 37:10.520
- How can that happen overnight?
- What are we supposed to eat now?

37:11.880 --> 37:15.560
Anders, he's shaking!
Do something!

37:15.720 --> 37:19.800
- Was he like that all night?
- No, he was awake!

37:19.960 --> 37:22.520
- What did he say?
- Nothing!

37:22.680 --> 37:26.680
Why the hell are you filming?

37:26.840 --> 37:29.880
He's throwing up!
He's going to choke on it!

37:34.040 --> 37:37.120
It fucking stinks.

37:37.280 --> 37:40.760
Janne, what did he say?
I heard you moaning all night.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.680
He didn't say anything!

37:42.840 --> 37:47.040
We have to build a stretcher
and go get some help.

37:47.200 --> 37:50.120
We can't build a stretcher!

37:50.280 --> 37:53.360
- What should we do then?
- I don't know!

37:53.520 --> 37:57.560
- Could you check your phones?
- I did, mine's off.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.880
It's dead.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.960
- Let's try and lift him up.
- How do you mean?

38:36.120 --> 38:40.320
- Just pull at his sleeping bag?
- Yes, okay.

38:46.560 --> 38:50.480
- He's falling off.
- Let's try it.

38:54.760 --> 38:59.360
- He's sliding off.
- Fuck!

38:59.520 --> 39:02.800
- What...?
- Anders...

39:14.400 --> 39:17.920
Shit... What a trip.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.880
- What?
- I need to sit down.

39:24.040 --> 39:27.480
Let's get him over here.
Come on.

39:27.640 --> 39:32.520
- Okay, five minutes.
- He can lie down here.

39:32.680 --> 39:39.240
- I feel like I'm hung over.
- I'm exhausted too.

39:39.400 --> 39:45.280
- I'm completely worn out too.
- Right. Of course you are, Fjord.

39:45.440 --> 39:49.200
Can I have some of that?

40:02.320 --> 40:06.480
I'm fucking thirsty.

40:06.640 --> 40:10.840
- Could you check your phones?
- I've checked it a million times.

40:11.000 --> 40:16.440
Hold this. I'll show you
that they're not working.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.480
- On...
- What?

40:21.640 --> 40:25.920
I'll be damned.

40:26.080 --> 40:28.600
Is yours working too?
Does it have service?

40:28.760 --> 40:33.920
There's no network.
I'll try again.

40:34.080 --> 40:37.440
It doesn't work.

40:37.600 --> 40:42.800
- There's no service.
- Did you try Alex's phone?

40:45.600 --> 40:50.640
Anders, hand me your phone.
What date does it say it is?

40:50.800 --> 40:54.040
Mine says it's the 24th.

40:54.200 --> 41:00.560
- Yes, so what?
- That's what yours says too.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.200
- When did we leave?
- On the 18th.

41:03.360 --> 41:08.440
Friday the 18th, and today is the 24th.
How could almost a week have gone by?

41:08.600 --> 41:12.680
- Mine says it's the 24th too.
- So we've been here almost a week.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.760
We've only slept twice.

41:15.920 --> 41:20.440
No wonder we're dehydrated
if we've slept for four days.

41:20.600 --> 41:24.840
We haven't slept for four days.
The phones are just off.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.920
I know it sounds crazy,
but this is a classic sign of aliens.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.120
- That's a load of crap.
- Janne!

41:32.280 --> 41:38.320
You have to admit it's fucked up.
Our food went moldy in one day!

41:38.480 --> 41:43.680
- I don't know...
- The phones made weird noises.

41:43.840 --> 41:48.000
What else do you need?
Do I need to be sucked into space?

41:48.160 --> 41:51.720
I'm sick of this shit!

41:53.320 --> 41:54.800
I'm turning it off.

42:02.040 --> 42:07.520
- What do you think happened to Alex?
- It could be the mushrooms.

42:07.680 --> 42:10.520
Maybe he has some congenital disease.

42:10.680 --> 42:14.600
- Maybe he has a brain tumor.
- What congenital disease?

42:14.760 --> 42:19.720
- What about all that white goo?
- I'm not a doctor.

42:19.880 --> 42:23.760
Tell me, who wrote
that amazing manuscript?

42:23.920 --> 42:26.480
- It was good, wasn't it?
- No.

42:26.640 --> 42:29.840
- Alex wrote it.
- Alex did?

42:30.000 --> 42:34.040
It was something he did
at the film school.

42:34.200 --> 42:36.320
It was really bad.

42:38.320 --> 42:44.040
But if we keep filming now,
we'll have a world-class documentary.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.520
About what?

42:46.680 --> 42:49.920
People who disappear in Sweden.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.800
People who go into comas
and stuff like that.

42:52.960 --> 42:57.880
All the scary shit in the woods.
It's like The Blair Witch Project.

42:58.040 --> 43:02.640
We're stuck here anyway
and crazy stuff is happening.

43:02.800 --> 43:07.600
We might as well film it
and make a fortune.

43:23.000 --> 43:26.600
- What are you doing, Fjord?
- I need the bathroom.

43:26.760 --> 43:32.240
Are you going to film yourself
while you're pooping?

43:32.400 --> 43:36.520
No, but I can't see anything
without the night vision.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.800
Have fun.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.600
Fuck!

44:43.480 --> 44:45.800
- Pause it.
- Look, look, look!

44:45.960 --> 44:48.560
Rewind it.

44:48.720 --> 44:52.040
Zoom in on that.

44:52.200 --> 44:56.280
- What the hell is this, Fjord?
- It's you.

44:56.440 --> 45:00.960
- How the hell did you do this?
- I can't make something like this.

45:01.120 --> 45:05.760
That's it! This is Fjord's doing.
This is all about your movie!

45:05.920 --> 45:09.840
He has a team out there
and they're messing with us.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.520
Give me that. We'll make
a fucking film out of it, Fjord.

45:14.680 --> 45:18.480
- Come on, let's go!
- What are you doing? Stop!

45:18.640 --> 45:22.880
This is serious!
Smile, you're on!

45:23.040 --> 45:27.360
I can't make an effect like that!
How could I possibly do that!

45:27.520 --> 45:32.600
I've tried to explain it to you
all along! I told you! This is crazy!

45:40.480 --> 45:45.640
Two cans of baked beans, one tuna
and three bottles of water are left.

45:46.600 --> 45:52.600
He's all clammy.
Anders, he hasn't had any water.

45:52.760 --> 45:55.120
Give him some water then.

45:55.280 --> 46:00.240
- He can't drink it by himself.
- Lift his head.

46:08.480 --> 46:11.280
It comes back out.

46:11.440 --> 46:16.680
I have a first-aid kit. There's
a syringe, we can make a drip.

46:16.840 --> 46:21.440
What?
We can't just inject water into him.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.840
That's what they do
at the hospital.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.800
If you're dehydrated,
the hospital gives you a saline drip.

46:29.960 --> 46:33.360
Give me the water.
You're right, he needs salt.

46:33.520 --> 46:38.160
Do you know
how much salt to put in?

46:38.320 --> 46:41.320
Not really.

46:41.480 --> 46:44.720
You just need...

46:44.880 --> 46:49.480
As long as it dissolves.
It's called a saturated solution.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.760
If you know
what you're doing, then...

46:52.920 --> 46:55.800
Well, we have to try something.

46:55.960 --> 46:59.760
- But how much?
- Just a spoonful.

46:59.920 --> 47:03.560
A spoonful?
There isn't that much water in here.

47:03.720 --> 47:08.600
There's way more salt on fries.
It's not dangerous, Janne.

47:08.760 --> 47:14.080
It's fine. You know what you're doing.
Let's inject water into him.

47:14.240 --> 47:18.760
It would be nice
if we were all in agreement.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.360
He doesn't have any veins.

47:24.960 --> 47:27.720
There's a nice one right there.

47:27.880 --> 47:31.360
I'll do it very gently.

47:33.360 --> 47:36.600
- It looks really gross.
- Move that camera.

47:36.760 --> 47:39.280
- What's happening?
- Anders, stop!

47:39.440 --> 47:43.280
Alex? What's happening?

47:43.440 --> 47:48.840
He's cramping up!
Hold him down, hold him down!

47:49.000 --> 47:53.760
- What the hell is that?
- He's foaming at the mouth!

47:55.800 --> 47:59.720
- What are you doing with the stick?
- He can't breathe!

47:59.880 --> 48:02.400
- Alex?
- Move that stick!

48:05.000 --> 48:08.360
Is he still breathing?

48:10.160 --> 48:14.400
Anders, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

48:20.200 --> 48:23.720
Come on, Alex!
Come on!

48:32.280 --> 48:34.960
- Anders...
- Come on, Alex!

48:35.120 --> 48:41.960
Fuck!
One, two, three, four...

48:43.080 --> 48:47.000
- Try pounding his chest.
- Shut up, Fjord!

48:47.160 --> 48:51.080
Fuck!
We need help over here!

48:53.960 --> 48:56.760
Come on, Alex.

49:03.080 --> 49:06.120
Come on!

49:18.840 --> 49:24.280
Janne, stop. It's over.
He's gone.

49:26.440 --> 49:30.000
Janne, stop.

49:31.080 --> 49:36.160
Alex, come on!
Come on! Come on!

49:36.320 --> 49:37.600
Come on!

49:37.760 --> 49:42.080
Hey, stop! Look!

49:42.240 --> 49:46.320
Holy shit!

49:46.480 --> 49:50.760
Jesus fuck...

49:53.360 --> 49:56.440
- You fucking did it.
- He's breathing.

50:08.400 --> 50:13.240
- Can I have some more water?
- We're out of water.

50:13.400 --> 50:16.360
Give me that.
I'll go fill it up.

50:16.520 --> 50:19.720
Wait here.

50:20.680 --> 50:22.720
I'm so nauseous.

50:53.240 --> 50:56.320
Shit, that's gross.

50:56.480 --> 51:00.320
This is too disgusting.

51:05.880 --> 51:09.320
I can't take
this fucking country anymore.

51:09.480 --> 51:15.960
The Swedish Chef can kiss my ass.
Fuck you, Pippi Longstocking.

51:19.680 --> 51:22.720
Yes! Great!

51:25.760 --> 51:29.160
This is unbelievable.

51:29.320 --> 51:33.680
- Anders? Janne?
- What's going on?

51:33.840 --> 51:37.520
- There's a cabin over there!
- Is someone there?

51:37.680 --> 51:40.240
- I don't know.
- Did you go up there?

51:40.400 --> 51:44.920
No. I went to get you three.
There's some kind of tower.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.960
Hello?

51:53.240 --> 51:56.680
Jesus...

51:56.840 --> 52:01.200
This is so old school.

52:01.360 --> 52:04.600
Let's put him down here.

52:04.760 --> 52:07.600
Check it out.

52:07.760 --> 52:12.240
- Where did you get that?
- It was on the ground.

52:19.720 --> 52:23.160
I don't think anyone's here.

52:27.240 --> 52:31.720
- It's really gross in here.
- Is there any power?

52:31.880 --> 52:35.000
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

52:35.160 --> 52:39.560
There must be power.
There are outlets.

52:39.720 --> 52:43.280
There must be a generator
or something.

52:48.440 --> 52:51.720
This is so old school.
Awesome.

52:57.320 --> 53:00.520
Look what I found.

53:00.680 --> 53:05.280
Spam!
And porn.

53:05.440 --> 53:08.680
That's a nasty combo.
It was in the camera.

53:10.880 --> 53:13.280
- Do we have power?
- Yes!

53:13.440 --> 53:17.200
We have power!
Is there any food?

53:17.360 --> 53:22.200
There's Spam.
That's all I could find.

53:22.360 --> 53:25.800
It's nasty in here.
Should we bring Alex inside?

53:25.960 --> 53:28.160
He's fine out there.

53:30.400 --> 53:33.240
- What is this?
- At least we found a cabin.

53:33.400 --> 53:35.280
We can sleep inside.

53:35.440 --> 53:40.040
- Check it out.
- What did you find?

53:40.200 --> 53:45.080
- This must be the cabin.
- What does it say?

53:47.520 --> 53:50.120
Hey, look at that.

53:50.280 --> 53:53.760
"Fucking base."

53:53.920 --> 53:58.520
It's a military base.
Seriously, it's a military base.

53:58.680 --> 54:01.680
Military base, military people.
We're saved!

54:01.840 --> 54:05.480
- It's not that far away.
- We're saved!

54:05.640 --> 54:11.280
- Let's see if there's anyone there.
- It's a base, we can go home soon!

54:11.440 --> 54:15.400
- Let's look at it first.
- We should celebrate!

54:15.560 --> 54:22.000
- Let's eat the Spam!
- I'll film you eating that thing.

54:22.160 --> 54:25.320
- Let's go get Alex.
- Shit, I'm hungry!

54:25.480 --> 54:31.360
- Let's get this on tape first.
- I can't believe you're doing this.

54:31.520 --> 54:34.320
Fuck, you're nasty.

54:34.480 --> 54:39.040
- Delicious, Fjord.
- It looks kind of gross.

54:39.200 --> 54:44.080
Don't eat that stuff, man.

54:44.240 --> 54:48.760
I'll wash it down with some vodka.
This is what I call a party!

54:48.920 --> 54:52.720
It tastes a bit rancid.

54:52.880 --> 54:55.880
No, no, no...

54:58.040 --> 55:00.440
This is the best movie I've ever made.

55:02.640 --> 55:07.360
- Are we watching a movie?
- There was a tape in the camera.

55:12.960 --> 55:17.800
- Man, that's horrible.
- Turn that shit off.

55:17.960 --> 55:21.920
- Look!
-I'm going to kill this right now.

55:22.080 --> 55:25.720
He's Danish.

55:31.800 --> 55:36.480
They're running around with a gun
while they're totally wasted.

55:38.240 --> 55:43.760
It looks like that man on the road.

55:47.480 --> 55:52.000
Shit, he's drunk.

55:52.160 --> 55:56.720
- No wonder.
- Yes, he was a bit vacant.

56:05.320 --> 56:07.920
What's he doing?

56:08.080 --> 56:11.120
- He's digging.
-What are you doing?

56:11.280 --> 56:14.680
Stop the tape, Janne.
Pause it!

56:14.840 --> 56:17.760
Look at that!

56:17.920 --> 56:20.040
There's a body there.

56:23.120 --> 56:26.920
Keep playing.

56:27.080 --> 56:31.920
What the fuck is he doing?
He's a psychopath.

56:34.360 --> 56:37.560
What the hell?

56:37.720 --> 56:41.640
What was that?

56:41.800 --> 56:44.320
Okay...

56:50.400 --> 56:56.200
Janne?
Are the camera batteries charging?

56:56.360 --> 57:00.640
Yes. I'm going to bed.
Would you mind locking the door?

57:00.800 --> 57:05.800
- Can't you do it yourself?
- No, would you please do it?

57:05.960 --> 57:11.080
- Fjord... Please...
- Fine, I'll lock it.

58:43.040 --> 58:46.120
What the hell is going on?

58:57.560 --> 59:00.720
Fjord?

59:06.000 --> 59:10.080
What the hell is going on?

59:14.440 --> 59:17.880
Anders, listen!
The noises!

59:18.040 --> 59:20.400
- Fjord!
- What's going on?

59:20.560 --> 59:24.960
What's happening?
Come on, Janne, we need to leave!

59:26.280 --> 59:28.840
Get out of there, now!

59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.160
- Over here!
- Come on!

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.960
Come on, Anders!
Get in here!

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.640
Do you believe me now, Anders?

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.360
- What the hell was that?
- Do you believe me now?

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:36.600
- You don't know what it is!
- Do you still think I'm behind it?

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:41.720
- What about Alex?
- We can't go out and get him now.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.640
Fjord, come on!

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.440
Calm down, Anders!
Don't panic!

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.880
Can we stop for a moment?
I can't breathe.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.880
Is anyone there, Anders?

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.000
Do you see anything?

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.840
What the hell is that?

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.600
Quiet, Janne.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.680
What was that?

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.440
Jesus.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.320
Fucking hell.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.040
What the hell is this place?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.160
Wow. That's a radar, Anders.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.000
- What are you doing?
- We're staying here.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.040
We have to go back for Alex.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.640
We'll stay here for a moment
and then we'll go get Alex.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.360
Did you get it on tape?

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:59.440
Let's do this quickly.
In and out as fast as possible.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.560
Slow down, Anders.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.400
- Janne will keep a lookout.
- Okay.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.680
Is he okay?

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.880
Let's get out of here.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.160
Shut up, Janne!

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:29.600
Let's get out of here.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:37.160
Come on!

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.760
Jesus Christ.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.880
- Are we just leaving him?
- My fucking arms...

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.840
- But it's freezing.
- He's fine there.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:09.560
Calm down. It's just as cold
further down. Come on.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.400
Could you stop messing with that shit?

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:21.680
- I'm trying to get it to work.
- There's no power down here.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.480
In order to get power
you need to find the main switch.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.720
Then let's find the main switch.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.600
- Come on, Anders.
- We're going to look for some power.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.240
Just leave him alone.
Come on.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:42.440
We have a walkie-talkie.

01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.600
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:15.480
It looks like a kitchen.

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.600
Anders?

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.360
Fucking hell.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:35.320
Anders?

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:47.480
- What is that?
- Anders?

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.480
Turn that walkie-talkie off.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:53.080
- Is this it?
- I don't know.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.640
- Turn it on.
- Here we go!

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.400
Where did that psycho go now?

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:38.160
- Well?
- I'm not sure. "Line on" is up.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.960
- Did you try?
- Yes, I turned it on.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.360
It still doesn't have power.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:52.560
- Where the fuck were you?
- Taking a leak.

01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:56.680
- We have light. There's power!
- Where's my bag?

01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:00.880
This isn't working!
Can we go get Alex now?

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:04.640
We can't carry Alex
down those stairs.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.280
- Where are you going?
- To look for my bag.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.560
Janne, we can't carry him
down those stairs.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:18.319
I can put up a webcam. Then you
can keep an eye on him all the time.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:23.319
And we can keep an eye on
the door too. Here, take the camera.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:45.880
It's rolling.
That's on. It's all good.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.160
Online...
Wi-Fi is on.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.800
Camera two...

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.520
- How many cameras did you put up?
- Six.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:17.160
Fuck! He's gone!

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:22.520
- He has no idea where he is.
- Anders! Alex is gone!

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:27.240
Look at the surveillance video.
He isn't there.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.000
Alex?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.160
Sorry.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.200
Alex?

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.960
- Alex?
- Are you just standing there?

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.920
- Alex?
- Are you okay?

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:14.440
- Alex?
- He doesn't have any shoes on.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.280
- Shit...
- How hard is it to turn on a generator?

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:24.600
- There was power a moment ago.
- We can't find our way now.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.960
- Is this where we came from? No...
- No, here!

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.920
Do you need something, Alex?
Are you okay?

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.520
Alex, what happened
out there with the lights?

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.360
- Leave him alone.
- Alex, what happened?

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.960
Anders, let's go find the generator.
We'll be right back.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.480
Calm down, man.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:03.560
Alex, are you okay?

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.800
Do you remember
going towards the lights?

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:18.560
I was so fucking scared.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:26.720
It doesn't matter now.
We'll get out of here.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.280
Alex?

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.560
Alex? What are you doing?

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.840
Anders?

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:50.200
- I need some cutaways.
- Shut up about the cutaways!

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.400
Which way are we going?
You've been here before.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:01.160
I'm pretty sure we should go left.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:10.360
Fuck, it just keeps going.
Look how long this passage is.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.320
- I think it's here.
- You just said to go left.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.640
Anders, stop!
There are footprints.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.880
Those are yours, man.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.440
My boots aren't that big.

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.520
Alex?

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:37.280
Stop it.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:51.320
The table is set.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.480
Anders! Fjord!

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:03.000
- Run, Anders!
- Fjord! Which way are we going?

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.560
Come on, Anders!

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.280
Come on, Anders!

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.800
Janne?
Janne, are you okay?

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.560
- What's going on?
- Where's Alex?

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.040
It's not him.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:29.240
- What do you mean?
- Explain what happened.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:35.440
He tried to strangle me
and then he walked off. It's not Alex!

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:41.720
- Where the hell is he?
- I don't know, he ran off!

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.840
- Give me some light.
- Have you gone psycho?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.080
- Have I gone psycho?
- No, but what are you doing?

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:56.440
I'm making a saline solution.
You saw what happened in the woods.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.120
- Are you going to kill him?
- You said he attacked you.

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:05.360
- He tried to strangle you.
- So you're going to kill him?

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.040
Anders, we need some light.
I can't see anything.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.280
- Is it him?
- I can't see anything.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:04.040
Alex?

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.200
- Alex?
- Is it him?

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.120
Easy, easy...

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.920
What are you doing, Alex?

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.760
What the hell
is that thing, Alex?

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.320
I don't know!

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:12.960
- Jesus Christ.
- What the hell is this?

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.520
- Do you remember anything?
- Yes.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.360
Do you remember
what happened out by the lights?

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.440
I remember going out to the lights
and then being attacked by something.

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:45.200
They stabbed me with something.
Right here.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.880
Shit...

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.520
- What is it?
- You have three stab wounds.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.920
A triangle.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.200
Fuck, this is creepy.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:09.640
Everything went dark...

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:13.960
Then I woke up.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:19.840
And I saw someone
who looked just like me.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.280
He had tubes in his mouth
and all over his body.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.480
I pulled them out of him...

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:35.080
Then everything went crazy.
I woke up on the ground, freezing.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:39.040
I ran around in the woods
looking for you.

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:43.480
I found the camp, but you were gone,
so I followed some tracks.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.320
They must have been
from the stretcher.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.360
We thought
we were carrying you on a stretcher.

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.760
So you've been carrying around
the man from the passageway?

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.920
There, there and there.

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:04.840
This is really creepy.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.040
We've all been cloned.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:13.160
Listen to this. It's a transcription
of an interrogation...

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.080
- What is it?
- Nothing, I'm okay.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.360
Listen.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.360
When I've counted down from 10
you'll be in a deep trance.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:29.560
9, 8, 7, 6...

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:35.640
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:42.040
You're now in a deep trance.
You can only tell the truth.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.000
What's the procedure
for the ones that do it?

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.320
They'll send a clone ship.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.920
The intelligent life form is cloned.

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:58.520
The clone dispenses of the original
and sends back information.

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.520
- Are you a copy of Mr. Guldbrandsen?
- I'm a simu... David Guldbrandsen.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:25.320
We do it too, sort of.
We send probes to Mars.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:30.120
Instead of clones we just have
clumsy robots stumbling around.

01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.720
This is brilliant.

01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:36.680
They're copying what evolution
spent millions of years creating.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.200
One quick clone
and they have a piece of the Earth -

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.200
- which can run around
completely unnoticed -

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:47.760
- and collect intel to find out
whether they can invade Earth.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:53.080
Give me that camera.
Let me go.

01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.440
You needed footage
for your film, right?

01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:01.560
Anders?

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:06.120
You wanted to finish
that documentary, right?

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.520
- Just let him go.
- We can't let him go out there.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:14.800
- We're not risking our lives for this!
- I know, but it's suicide!

01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:16.240
Anders!

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.240
He ran out.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:32.360
Come on.
He's over here.

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:37.240
- Anders, stop!
- Stop it, you psycho.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.920
- There's no need to do this.
- Alex, help!

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:46.080
Stop, Anders!
This is insane!

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.880
- Anders, come on!
- Have you gone mad?

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.840
Get away from there!

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.880
Come on!

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.400
That fucking psycho.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:44.000
This is just crazy.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.600
-Are you there?
- Anders?

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:53.560
-Janne?
- Anders, where are you?

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:57.000
Are you back inside the base?

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:01.440
- Yes, where the hell are you?
- What's he doing?

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.640
It doesn't...

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:07.000
Anders, where the hell are you?

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.160
Listen, Janne...

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:15.800
I can't hear what he's saying.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:19.040
Anders, I can't hear you!
Where are you?

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:22.360
I know that I messed up.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:27.680
- Tell him to come back.
- It doesn't matter, just come back!

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.040
Where is he?

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:41.000
Listen, Anders. Get out of there
and come down here now.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.240
Wait until someone gets there.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.600
Come on, Fjord.
Just cut it out.

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.560
You've got to be kidding.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.240
- We didn't plug it in.
- You're not serious?

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:25.400
SOS. This is Janne Schaumburg.
Is anyone there?

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:31.280
This is an SOS, Janne Schaumburg
speaking. Is anyone there?

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:38.120
Find the flashlights.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.200
- I have one.
- We need to restart it.

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:49.000
- Okay, calm down.
- We need to get to the generator.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:56.200
Who the fuck is that?
Can you see who it is?

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.960
Someone is standing there.

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.920
- Anders?
- That's not Anders.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:04.280
- Give me the syringe.
- Here.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.480
Is that you, Anders?

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.720
What do you want?

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.560
Come on, then!

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.440

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.080
Come on, Alex is waiting.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.480
Give me that camera,
we need power.

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:14.720
Alex?

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:18.320
Oh, no.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:26.320
- Oh, fuck.
- Fjord, we have to go get him!

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.560
- Can you please go first?
- Okay, then take the camera.

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.760

- Yes, I have one.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.760
Wait... Wait...

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.800
Fjord? Fjord?

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.120
Fjord?

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.400
