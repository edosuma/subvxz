-Deal.

00:07.550 --> 00:10.337
There's a whole world full of people
that don't know who or what we are.

00:10.428 --> 00:13.090
What if they see a girl
turning into a wolf, for example?

00:13.181 --> 00:16.423
When I pour this potion
onto the object I hold most dear,

00:16.517 --> 00:18.132
that object becomes a talisman

00:18.227 --> 00:20.934
that allows me to cross the town line
and still remember who / am.

No, no. Let me.

00:38.289 --> 00:41.156
Let me. All better. Good.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.365
How did you do that?

00:42.460 --> 00:43.449
It's nothing to be afraid of.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.045
BELLE: Get away!

-What are you?

00:47.381 --> 00:48.370
Are you okay?

00:48.466 --> 00:49.797
I'm at the town line.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.624
Two people down. Maybe three.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.877
There's a car pretty banged up
with Pennsylvania plates.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.473
-What's going on?
-She crossed over the line.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.388
She doesn't remember.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.221
Hey, beautiful. (GROANS)

01:02.271 --> 01:04.011
Here, I didn't think you noticed. Ah!

01:04.565 --> 01:05.645
Your ribs are broken.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.439
Well, that must be why it hurts
when I laugh.

01:07.526 --> 01:08.732
Did you see his face?

01:09.070 --> 01:11.277
His one true love, gone in an instant.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.104
Just like Milah, crocodile,

01:14.951 --> 01:16.111
when you took her from me.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.779
But you took her first.

-Ah!
-Gold! Are you insane?

01:20.039 --> 01:21.575
Yes, I am!

01:21.666 --> 01:23.702
-You can't do this.
-I can if you let me go.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.666
-You don't want her to see that.
-l'm a stranger to her.

01:26.337 --> 01:27.793

Do you know this guy?

01:50.945 --> 01:52.060
Never seen him before.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.315
That's because he drove into town.

01:54.407 --> 01:56.068

Your mother gave me that
when we were married.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.010
It was her father's.
She wanted to keep it in the family.

03:20.409 --> 03:22.240

to leave now.

03:22.453 --> 03:23.909
I purchased you a commission.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.072
You will join the mobile 34th

03:28.709 --> 03:30.040

But I'm not sure you realize the
important scientific work he's doing.

03:32.588 --> 03:35.625
Certainly! But how will he do his work
without my financial support?

03:35.758 --> 03:37.373

Or is there another attachment
you'd prefer?

You're awfully chipper for a guy
who just failed to kill his enemy.

06:33.686 --> 06:35.051
Then got hit by a car.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.646
Well, my ribs may be broken,

06:37.606 --> 06:39.346
but everything else is still intact,

06:40.359 --> 06:43.021
which is more than could be said
for other bad days I've had.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.190
Plus, I did some quality damage
to my foe.

-You hurt Belle.
-I hurt his heart.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.816

You're chained down,
he's on his feet, immortal,

has magic, and you hurt his girl.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.146
You can't guess. There are a million
possible combinations.

-Ten thousand.
-Ten thousand.

07:26.864 --> 07:28.820
Leroy, can you get it open
or something? Hack it?

07:28.907 --> 07:30.283
Well, you do understand
that computer hacking

07:30.367 --> 07:31.652
and pick-axe hacking are different?

07:31.744 --> 07:33.109
Here. Let me try. I have a thing.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.943
And we do know something.
There was stuff in his car.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.325
Rental agreement, maps, receipts.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.247
His name is Greg Mendell.

07:39.335 --> 07:41.200
Now, let's see.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.332
Pictures of him alone at a bunch
of Eastern Seaboard tourist locations.

07:49.053 --> 07:50.543
Got a Linkedln account,

07:51.722 --> 07:54.338
and he tweets pictures of his food.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.640
I'll keep looking,
but I think what we have here

07:56.727 --> 07:59.139
is a well-documented,
real-life ordinary Joe.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.311
Or Greg.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.104
So whatever's kept random people

08:03.192 --> 08:05.148
from stumbling into Storybrooke
for the last 28 years...

08:05.235 --> 08:07.612
-Is gone.
-Anyone could drive in.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.311
Why are my instincts telling me
that's a bad thing?

08:09.615 --> 08:12.152
'Cause you've seen E. T. or Splash
or any other movie

08:12.242 --> 08:14.494
where they find something magical
and study it to death.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.371
Think what they'd do to a werewolf.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.821
Oh, and his friends and family? They're
going to come looking for him soon.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.156
Let's try not to overreact.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.582
Leroy's right.
We don't need outsiders here.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.160
Hook says he doesn't know
where Cora is.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.119
And God knows what she's gonna do.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.668
If other people come in here,
that's not going to be good for anyone.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.374
We need to find Regina,
tell her we know she was framed.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.585
I've been tracking her, no luck.
She's gone underground.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.760
MARY: What if Cora finds her first?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.883
I don't wanna think about the damage
those two would do together.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.225
This could not have come
at a worse time.

08:37.309 --> 08:38.719
It's okay.
The guy's being patched up right now.

08:38.811 --> 08:39.971
He'll probably be on his way home
by morning.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.051
WHALE: Not quite.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.596
He's bleeding into his chest cavity.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.685
It's not a full flood, you know,

08:45.776 --> 08:48.438
but pretty soon,
he'll be drowning in his own blood.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.110
So make it stop.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.358
Aren't you a doctor?

08:56.829 --> 08:58.740
WHALE: Gold.

08:59.123 --> 09:00.659
You fixed me.

09:00.749 --> 09:01.784
Now fix him.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.958
It will take you seconds
and cost you nothing.

09:06.672 --> 09:07.957
-No.
-No?

09:08.632 --> 09:09.838
Just, "No"?

09:09.925 --> 09:11.711
I owe you nothing, Whale.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.713
I owe none of you anything.

09:13.804 --> 09:15.510
And some of you owe me.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.214
So, yeah. Just no.

09:18.308 --> 09:22.051
Oh... And point of interest, the driver,
he saw me throwing some magic.

09:22.146 --> 09:23.807
So instead of trying
to get him out of here,

09:23.897 --> 09:26.730
you better be hoping he dies,
because if he doesn't,

09:26.984 --> 09:30.147
he's going to be driving tour buses
up and down Main Street.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.488
So glad I don't give a damn.

09:41.707 --> 09:45.165
Look. Letting him die is easy.

09:45.627 --> 09:49.040
I can do that, if that's what you decide.

09:49.548 --> 09:52.005
Let's take this somewhere private.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.467
It's not really murder if we let him
succumb to his injuries.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.589
Pretty sure it is.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.261
Of course we save him.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.508
-Obviously.
-Well...

09:59.600 --> 10:01.340
-Leroy!
-We got to think it through.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.685
If we save him and kill the whole town,
is that really better?

10:04.813 --> 10:07.646
So we have to choose
between our lives and his.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.018
We can worry about the town later.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.229
Which doesn't mean
we should abandon it.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.687
I know, but let's worry about
Storybrooke after we save a life.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.278
How did you get in here? Who are you?

11:04.414 --> 11:07.781
(CHUCKLES)
Stiltskin. Rumple von Stiltskin.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.742
A foreigner.

11:09.837 --> 11:12.249
What tipped you off?
My rosy complexion?

11:13.048 --> 11:16.711
Yes, I've seen nothing
of your drab little land yet,

11:16.802 --> 11:18.588
but I am interested in your work.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.842
Well, you're a little late.
I've been shut down.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.638
And I can't bring back
dead loved ones anyway,

11:23.725 --> 11:24.805
if that's what you're after.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.551
(LAUGHS) I think my deceased are
best kept where they are, dearie,

11:27.646 --> 11:28.931
thank you very much.

11:29.064 --> 11:33.933
No, no, no. My interest is in
how you do what you do.

11:34.069 --> 11:37.277
You see, where I come from,
we do things differently.

11:37.823 --> 11:42.112
Your land has witchcraft,
but it's feeble, neglected stuff.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.193
Where I live, it's strong and hearty.

11:44.288 --> 11:47.246
But it cannot restore life.

11:48.917 --> 11:52.284
-If you can do this, well,
-(COINS CLINKING)

and I'm willing to pay.

(THUNDERCLAP)

12:00.929 --> 12:02.544
How did you do that?

12:02.639 --> 12:03.890
Missing the point.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.632
Money, yours.

12:06.727 --> 12:07.887
Are you a philanthropist?

12:07.978 --> 12:09.718
Well, I've been called worse.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.555
There is a cost to you. Knowledge.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.732
You teach me to wield
whatever it is you wield.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.275
That is the deal.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.190
Then it's a deal.

12:19.281 --> 12:20.361
I thought you were bringing...

12:20.490 --> 12:22.481
-Igor! Tremendous news. This is...
-(THUNDERCLAP)

12:24.870 --> 12:25.859

12:30.250 --> 12:31.490
Master,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.035
what's happened?

12:35.672 --> 12:39.381
Bring back the equipment.
We're staying.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.259
And we're going to need a body.

13:23.095 --> 13:24.380
-Hello, Rumple.
-(GASPS)

13:28.934 --> 13:31.050
Well, I expected
this was just a matter of time.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.978
I had hoped you were dead, but, hey,
disappointment's just part of life.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.271
I'm sure we can agree on that.

13:36.358 --> 13:39.225
Aw, the crocodile snaps at the little bird.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.309
And after I brought you a gift.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.191
Yeah, did you bring the antidote, too?

13:43.281 --> 13:46.318
Oh, Rumple, it's a peace offering.

13:46.410 --> 13:50.995
And what do you want
for this peace offering?

13:51.873 --> 13:53.124
My daughter.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.992
You were so clever to get her

13:56.086 --> 13:57.622
to lay the curse
so you could come here.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.329
But you don't need her anymore.

14:00.424 --> 14:03.962
Let me try to get her back,
and let us live.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.132
And what do I get for my troubles?

14:08.432 --> 14:09.467
Your son.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.320
You know what that is, of course.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.407
It Will find him.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.914
(CHUCKLES) Oh, darling,
I have no reason to cheat you.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.120
Anymore.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.624
I want you

14:43.633 --> 14:47.171
to find the one person in this universe
who might still love you.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.255
After all, I'm doing the same thing.

14:53.643 --> 14:57.056
Do you have any spells
to return memories?

14:58.315 --> 15:02.934
I only know what you taught me,
(SIGHS) master.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.021
So, will you accept my offer of a truce?

15:12.079 --> 15:13.819
Truce.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.157
Let's seal it like we used to.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.691
I thought you'd be scrubbing in by now.

15:53.537 --> 15:56.574
Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna do that.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.580

16:01.711 --> 16:03.872
-I'm not drunk.
-Okay. You just...

16:04.548 --> 16:06.539

I don't care what he saw,
we don't let go of people.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.381

I thought you worked with cells
in Petri dishes.

16:45.463 --> 16:48.375
My work has progressed.
And I thought you supported me.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.868
Gerhardt?

17:24.836 --> 17:25.996
Same person again.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.623
"Her." Cute.

17:27.714 --> 17:28.749
Probably a girlfriend.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.216
We could answer it.
Just let her know he's okay.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.380
He's not okay.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.584
He's alive.
We could let her know he's alive.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.464
No, the police could trace it
here instantly.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.795

Wait, wait, any news?

17:51.655 --> 17:53.065
No. I was just looking for the doctor.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.612
He's not in the OR?

17:54.699 --> 17:56.781
-He never came in.
-Then page him.

41:08.258 --> 41:10.123
-Leaving?
-Where?

41:10.218 --> 41:12.550
Wait, find someone...

41:12.638 --> 41:14.094
-Who?
-My son.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.756
And it has to be today
because every minute I'm here

41:18.268 --> 41:20.384
is a minute closer to me killing Hook.

41:20.771 --> 41:23.012
So it's really best for all concerned
if I leave.

41:23.106 --> 41:24.516
And you're going to come with me.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.070
Oh, and we have a long history,

41:29.154 --> 41:31.816
so know this, and know it to be true.

41:32.240 --> 41:36.199
If any harm comes to Belle
while I'm gone,

41:36.286 --> 41:37.401
I'm killing all of you.

41:39.498 --> 41:41.284
I'll see you at noon.

41:54.805 --> 41:55.794
(SIGHS)

42:03.730 --> 42:05.140
Honey?

42:06.024 --> 42:07.730
I know, just wait, wait.

42:07.818 --> 42:10.400
Just listen, just listen, okay?
Yes, I'm okay.

42:10.487 --> 42:13.570
I was in an accident.

42:13.657 --> 42:15.113
Honey,

42:16.660 --> 42:19.697
you're not going to believe what I saw.
