00:15.065 --> 00:18.026
[sighs] I can't believe he's gone.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.989
I don't think I can go back
to that empty house,

00:22.573 --> 00:23.866
open the door and...

00:25.326 --> 00:29.371
not hear his nails scratching on the floor
as he runs to it.

00:29.455 --> 00:32.333
You know what? I'm gonna...
I'll meet you there.

00:34.126 --> 00:35.127
Okay.

00:52.102 --> 00:55.773
- [chuckles softly] This is a nice place.
- Thank you.

01:00.403 --> 01:01.654
You moved on up.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.739
Why couldn't you have lived here
when we were together?

01:04.822 --> 01:05.903
What are you saying? You...

01:05.949 --> 01:08.494
you didn't enjoy
the cramped studio apartment

01:08.577 --> 01:10.697
- in the Valley with no air conditioning?
- [chuckles]

01:12.706 --> 01:15.292
[sighs] This is harder than I thought.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.336
Think about it this way...

01:18.421 --> 01:21.006
This is the first time you have to
come home without him here.

01:21.089 --> 01:23.551
It's never gonna be as bad as this.

01:24.468 --> 01:26.970
That's actually not necessarily true.

01:28.514 --> 01:32.851
When my dad died,
it actually got harder as time went on.

01:32.935 --> 01:35.979
- Oh.
- Sorry. I know you're trying to help.

01:37.689 --> 01:40.776
Do you remember when he used to lie
on the floor and watch us have sex?

01:41.652 --> 01:46.615
- That, uh, creeped you out, as I recall.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

01:46.699 --> 01:48.867
It was another set of eyes
watching me have sex.

01:48.951 --> 01:51.662
- He didn't know what he was seeing.
- He absolutely did.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.038
[laughs]

01:53.122 --> 01:55.791
I think he even knew
when it was make-up sex.

01:56.208 --> 01:57.209
Hmm.

01:58.877 --> 02:00.713
I kinda feel like, um...

02:01.630 --> 02:05.676
our entire relationship
was just amazing make-up sex.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.260
Yeah.

02:08.512 --> 02:09.512
Yeah.

02:21.233 --> 02:23.235
[theme music playing]

02:39.251 --> 02:40.753
- Morning, Sam.
- Hi, Gus.

02:44.548 --> 02:45.883
[sighs]

02:51.388 --> 02:54.349
[Victor speaking Korean]

02:54.432 --> 02:55.809
[Tommy] Mmm-hmm.

02:55.893 --> 02:57.394
- Hello!
- [speaking Korean]

02:57.477 --> 02:58.979
- Hey! Good...
- Oh.

02:59.062 --> 03:01.398
Hey, Gus, uh, we're actually
kind of busy right now. So...

03:01.481 --> 03:04.317
Oh, yeah, no, I won't...
I won't take up much of your time.

03:04.401 --> 03:06.153
Guys, I just, um...

03:06.236 --> 03:10.448
Hey, I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for how things kinda got ugly there.

03:10.533 --> 03:14.620
And I just also wanted to say
thank you so much

03:14.703 --> 03:17.998
for listening to my ideas
on the Arctic movie.

03:18.081 --> 03:23.128
So, um, just wanted to give you this, uh,
map of the North Pole...

03:23.211 --> 03:25.213
- Wow! [laughs]
- just in case it inspires anything

03:25.297 --> 03:27.340
for your movie. And then, uh,

03:27.424 --> 03:32.137
when you finally get that movie green-lit,
here's a bottle of soju to celebrate.

03:32.220 --> 03:34.264
- [speaking Korean and laughing]
- Yeah.

03:34.347 --> 03:36.975
- [speaking Korean]
- Hey, all right!

03:37.059 --> 03:38.060
- [chuckles]
- Thank you.

03:38.143 --> 03:40.062
- Yeah, thanks so much.
- Yeah, of course.

03:40.145 --> 03:42.898
- Very thoughtful of you.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, happy to.

03:42.981 --> 03:44.083
- Very happy to.
- Thank you.

03:44.107 --> 03:46.836
- Uh, we're gonna get back to work here.
- Yeah. Yeah, get back to it.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.988
- [speaking Korean]
- Hmm.

03:54.743 --> 03:56.078
- [Tommy] Mmm-hmm.
- That's cool.

03:56.161 --> 03:58.246
- [Victor speaking Korean]
- Yeah...

03:58.330 --> 03:59.456
What's going on, Gus?

03:59.540 --> 04:02.250
Oh, nothing. Before I go,
I just wanted to let you know

04:02.334 --> 04:05.087
I was actually able to rejigger some
of my schedule,

04:05.170 --> 04:07.881
and I think I'll be able
to go to New York now.

04:08.381 --> 04:12.803
So, you know, if you wanted me to come
and kick around ideas, I can. So...

04:12.886 --> 04:16.014
Gus, the ship has sailed.
I mean, for Victor it's important

04:16.098 --> 04:18.851
that people be into a project
from the get-go, so...

04:18.934 --> 04:21.435
- Oh.
- [speaking Korean]

04:21.519 --> 04:24.022
[stammers]
We really need to get back to work, so...

04:24.773 --> 04:27.109
All right, well,
I'll let you guys go, and, uh...

04:27.192 --> 04:30.403
Or I'll let you get back to work,
and, um... Yeah.

04:35.743 --> 04:36.744
[sighs]

04:42.916 --> 04:45.210
Come on, let's not bite the nails.
Not a good look.

04:45.293 --> 04:47.921
[chuckling] Uh, sorry.
Nervous habit, I guess.

04:48.005 --> 04:49.547
Been a rough day?

04:50.340 --> 04:51.383
All right.

04:52.968 --> 04:55.470
- Wanna hang out tonight?
- Seriously?

04:56.388 --> 04:57.389
Yeah.

04:58.306 --> 04:59.892
Let's get some beers or something.

04:59.975 --> 05:02.060
Arya goes to bed at 9:00.

05:02.144 --> 05:03.854
I'm bored out of my fucking brains

05:03.937 --> 05:07.107
and I can't watch <i>Dateline</i> anymore
in that hotel room.

05:07.190 --> 05:08.310
Yeah, no, that'd be awesome.

05:08.358 --> 05:10.360
I could actually use the company.
That'd be nice.

05:10.443 --> 05:12.195
- Your place.
- Yeah, my place.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.571
- Sure.
- Awesome.

05:13.656 --> 05:16.825
- All right. I might bring a friend.
- What's that?

05:18.619 --> 05:20.328
- Oh, hey! [chuckles]
- [man] Hey.

05:20.412 --> 05:22.915
- Sorry. Stupid place to sit.
- No worries.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.550
Hey, I'm gonna head out.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.153
Where are you going?
I'm making chilaquiles.

05:35.177 --> 05:38.013
Ugh, I have so much bullshit to do today.

05:39.181 --> 05:40.348
Are we cool?

05:40.432 --> 05:41.599
Yeah.

05:41.684 --> 05:44.394
Not, uh, weirded out
about the fact that we had sex?

05:45.228 --> 05:47.022
- No.
- Good.

05:47.690 --> 05:49.607
Hey, um... [clears throat]

05:49.692 --> 05:51.335
you can tell me
if this is none of my business,

05:51.359 --> 05:54.362
but, uh, when I saw you
at the movies the other day,

05:54.446 --> 05:58.533
you were obviously with someone.
Is that, like, a serious thing, or...

05:58.616 --> 06:00.660
Um, you know,

06:00.744 --> 06:02.624
we've been seeing each other
for, like, a month.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.916
I thought it was gonna get serious,
but then it got really weird.

06:05.999 --> 06:09.753
- We never said we were exclusive.
- Good. For your sake.

06:10.879 --> 06:13.256
He was obviously very desperate
for me to like him.

06:13.340 --> 06:16.551
- Ah, he's just from the Midwest.
- Ah! Is that why he's so boring?

06:16.634 --> 06:18.804
[both chuckle]

06:18.887 --> 06:20.305
Gotta be careful, Mickey.

06:20.388 --> 06:22.850
Boring people are dangerous.
They'll make you boring, too.

06:22.933 --> 06:24.434
All right. Can we drop this now?

06:24.517 --> 06:26.644
Uh, actually, you guys
didn't even look like a couple.

06:26.729 --> 06:29.815
You looked more like a brother-sister
alt-rock band.

06:29.898 --> 06:32.192
- We did not.
- [chuckles] No, no, it was actually worse.

06:32.275 --> 06:34.402
You looked like a... a Christian folk duo.

06:34.486 --> 06:36.113
All right, I'm gonna go.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.781
- [chuckles] Call me later.
- Right.

06:42.452 --> 06:45.080
[man] I like the pepper
on that stuff right there.

06:45.163 --> 06:48.041
- [woman speaking indistinctly]
- [boy] A bacon fry.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.292
Ooh, wait, wait, wait.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.461
- [laughs]
- Let me try.

06:51.544 --> 06:52.814
[woman] You knew he was gonna do that.

06:52.838 --> 06:55.007
- You knew he was gonna do that.
- [all chuckling]

06:55.090 --> 06:56.133
[man] Could be warmer.

06:56.216 --> 06:59.011
[boy] We should've ordered
ranch dressing.

06:59.094 --> 07:01.554
Dad, can he sit with us?

07:03.390 --> 07:04.391
[woman] Aw.

07:06.601 --> 07:07.978
Well, what do you think?

07:10.981 --> 07:12.232
Um, sir?

07:13.275 --> 07:14.651
- Hmm?
- Hi.

07:14.735 --> 07:18.613
- Hi.
- Um, would you like to eat with us?

07:19.447 --> 07:23.118
Oh, uh... yeah, thanks.

07:24.119 --> 07:26.997
You know what? This is... this is so cool.
This is awesome.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.415
You know, it reminds me of...

07:28.498 --> 07:30.876
My dad used to take
my family and I to Denny's.

07:30.959 --> 07:34.337
Oh, and we loved it. We would flip out!

07:34.421 --> 07:36.173
- [laughs]
- I remember, one time...

07:36.256 --> 07:38.967
one time, my mom let us have
Pepsi for breakfast...

07:39.051 --> 07:40.052
[woman] Whoa!

07:40.135 --> 07:42.220
which I thought was,
like, the coolest thing.

07:42.304 --> 07:47.225
It's just... it's so cool to be, you know,
with a... with a family...

07:47.309 --> 07:52.397
and to, like, just...
like, be around this vibe.

07:54.024 --> 07:55.733
'Cause I just, I...

07:56.985 --> 08:01.949
I think... I'm, like, lonely out here,
and I just... I'm feeling homesick.

08:06.703 --> 08:09.039
I've never seen such a sad grown-up.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.562
- Can we get the check?
- Oh, this is embarrassing. [chuckles]

08:11.624 --> 08:13.836
- Oh, that's okay.
- [exclaims]

08:13.919 --> 08:16.754
Man, I don't mean to dump
everything out on you guys or...

08:16.839 --> 08:18.274
- That's fine.
- Don't worry about it.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.299
I'll give you my address.

08:19.382 --> 08:21.802
You guys can come over and dump
your feelings on me sometime.

08:21.885 --> 08:22.886
[all laughing]

08:22.970 --> 08:25.138
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Oh, hold on. Sorry.

08:26.056 --> 08:29.559
Oh, you know what? I gotta...
I gotta take this.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.937
But, um, let me pay for this.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.563
- No! No, no.
- No, no, no, let me pay.

08:33.645 --> 08:35.398
Thank you so much for everything.

08:37.234 --> 08:38.736
- Hi.
- [Mickey] <i>Hey.</i>

08:40.320 --> 08:44.241
- I miss you.
- [Gus] <i>I, uh... I miss you, too.</i>

08:44.324 --> 08:47.535
I'm sorry that I got so angry
when we Skyped.

08:47.619 --> 08:50.288
<i>No, no, no, it's okay. I was...</i>

08:50.873 --> 08:54.042
I was the one who was acting crazy.
[stammers and chuckles]

08:54.126 --> 08:55.836
It's nice to hear from you.

08:55.919 --> 08:58.964
Um... what've you been up to?
How are you doing?

08:59.047 --> 09:02.384
I've been good.
Yeah, work's been really great actually.

09:02.467 --> 09:07.097
Uh... I managed to convince that girl
to come over and do a show with us, so...

09:07.180 --> 09:09.391
<i>Oh, no way.
Oh, that's amazing, Mickey.</i>

09:09.474 --> 09:12.936
Yeah, so now Erika's
gonna let me kind of run with it.

09:13.020 --> 09:16.564
It's gonna be my show, and I can make
the full-time transition from, uh,

09:16.648 --> 09:18.608
you know, program manager to producer.

09:18.691 --> 09:22.029
Oh, my gosh, that's great.
Look at you, caring about work.

09:22.112 --> 09:24.447
- <i>I'm proud of ya.</i>
- That's a little condescending,

09:24.531 --> 09:25.615
but whatever.

09:25.698 --> 09:30.245
No, no, I didn't mean it...
that way. Sorry.

09:30.328 --> 09:35.083
It's fine, it's fine.
So, um, what've you been up to?

09:35.167 --> 09:38.670
Have you been fucking a bunch
of actresses on the set?

09:38.753 --> 09:42.257
What? No, I'm with you.

09:42.340 --> 09:45.385
I... I know that.
I was just... I was kidding.

09:45.468 --> 09:46.469
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- Whatever.

09:46.553 --> 09:49.431
No, that's... that's funny. Uh...

09:50.473 --> 09:55.145
<i>So how's everything else?
Are you... are you doing okay?</i>

09:55.228 --> 09:59.482
<i>You just... You sound like something...
something's going on.</i>

09:59.566 --> 10:03.236
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- What do you mean, something's going on?

10:03.320 --> 10:06.865
<i>I don't know. You just sound,
like, upset or manic or...</i>

10:06.949 --> 10:10.160
Manic? What? No, I'm not manic.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.245
I didn't know
you were now my psychiatrist, too.

10:12.329 --> 10:16.124
I'm fine. Thanks for checking in, Dr. Gus.

10:16.208 --> 10:19.586
- I'm just... concerned.
- Don't be concerned, dude!

10:19.669 --> 10:22.505
I'm not concerned about you.
[stammers]

10:23.506 --> 10:26.718
This is the shit that makes me pull away.

10:26.801 --> 10:30.263
[stammers] I shouldn't have called you.
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.599
Okay, Mickey?

10:34.142 --> 10:35.977
Shit. Fuck.

10:36.478 --> 10:39.106
[woman] Hi, do you have a few seconds
to help save our oceans?

10:39.189 --> 10:42.067
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have ice cream sandwiches.

10:42.150 --> 10:45.195
They melt, and then they're just not
as good when you re-freeze them.

10:47.239 --> 10:50.617
You know what? I'd be pretty selfish
if I didn't help the shellfish...

10:50.700 --> 10:53.078
- [Bertie] Oh, my God!
- [woman] Oh, shit!

11:00.127 --> 11:02.629
- [knocking on door]
- [Steven] Hey.

11:04.047 --> 11:07.300
- Hey, who is that?
- [Steven] Let me in.

11:07.384 --> 11:08.385
Ah!

11:08.468 --> 11:09.761
- [both laugh]
- You got me!

11:09.844 --> 11:12.180
I mean, I knew it was you,
but, uh, you still got me.

11:12.264 --> 11:14.807
- Ooh! Ah!
- Hey, I just, uh,

11:14.891 --> 11:17.894
ordered some chicken fingers,
if you want in on that, yeah?

11:17.977 --> 11:20.355
Oh, okay. Knock yourself out.
Let's do it.

11:20.438 --> 11:23.358
Maybe I'll, uh, fire up some <i>Ride Along 2.</i>

11:23.441 --> 11:24.609
Ooh!

11:25.777 --> 11:31.783
Hey, listen, um... Good news.
I invited an extra from the set over here.

11:32.367 --> 11:33.868
- Oh, okay.
- [grunts]

11:34.452 --> 11:37.580
You know, I think they like
to be called background actors.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.249
I think she likes to be called Natasha.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.585
Natasha? Okay, that's cool.

11:42.669 --> 11:46.173
I would have invited her to my room,
but, you know, I share it with Arya,

11:46.256 --> 11:48.550
- so that's a drag.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

11:48.633 --> 11:49.860
Are you okay? You seem a little off.

11:49.884 --> 11:52.137
Uh, I don't know. I'm all right.

11:52.804 --> 11:55.515
Things are a little weird
with Mickey right now. I...

11:56.349 --> 11:58.976
The plane ticket thing
didn't go over well.

11:59.061 --> 12:00.103
- No!
- Yeah,

12:00.187 --> 12:04.566
- she's not like the big gestures type.
- No! Oh, shit!

12:04.649 --> 12:06.526
Yikes. All right, well, change of plan.

12:07.110 --> 12:09.237
You know what you do now?
Give her some space.

12:09.987 --> 12:14.159
Yeah, just keep my distance.
Let her have some room. That makes sense.

12:14.242 --> 12:17.870
Yeah, trust me. She'll be sprinting back
to you once you ice her.

12:17.954 --> 12:21.166
Yeah, well,
that's really my only option that's left.

12:21.249 --> 12:24.752
- But it's hard, man. It's really hard.
- Hey, listen, life is hard.

12:24.836 --> 12:27.255
That's what keeps
the Seagram's company in business.

12:27.339 --> 12:28.607
- [both laughing]
- [knocking on door]

12:28.631 --> 12:31.008
Oh, oh, oh!
Look who it is. Look who it is.

12:31.093 --> 12:32.570
- Do you want to answer it...
- No, you...

12:32.594 --> 12:33.761
Okay.

12:35.097 --> 12:37.099
- [all] Hi!
- [Gus] Hello.

12:37.182 --> 12:39.392
- Oh, hello.
- Hi, I'm Natasha.

12:39.476 --> 12:41.644
- Starlet, welcome to the Oscars.
- Hi!

12:41.728 --> 12:45.440
- Ooh, this room is nice.
- Oh, yeah, right?

12:45.523 --> 12:47.442
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is Gus.

12:47.525 --> 12:51.279
- Oh, Gus, so you're the one with the...
- The one with the...

12:51.363 --> 12:53.257
- [Natasha laughs]
- [Steven] Gettin' right at it.

12:53.281 --> 12:55.968
- The... the chicken fingers?
- Wait a second. What do you got back...

12:55.992 --> 12:57.869
- The coke! [laughs]
- Yay!

12:57.952 --> 12:59.954
- You're the man, Gus!
- Is that coke?

13:00.037 --> 13:01.289
- Oh.
- Yeah.

13:01.372 --> 13:05.042
- [dramatic music playing]
- <i>♪ A heart full of love... ♪</i>

13:05.127 --> 13:06.128
Hey!

13:07.086 --> 13:09.714
Were you here last night?
I didn't hear you come in.

13:09.797 --> 13:11.508
Oh, yeah, I was out super late.

13:11.591 --> 13:14.844
Uh, Truman was acting nuts.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.596
It's a long, boring story.

13:16.679 --> 13:17.680
How are ya?

13:18.723 --> 13:22.310
- I almost died today.
- What? Are you okay?

13:23.228 --> 13:25.563
A car hit my shopping cart
while I was pushing it.

13:25.647 --> 13:28.733
And I saw a grapefruit explode
where my head could've been.

13:29.108 --> 13:31.319
This grapefruit. Look at it.

13:32.987 --> 13:35.323
- Jesus.
- I was just looking at this grapefruit,

13:35.407 --> 13:39.411
and I was thinking...
life could end at any moment

13:39.494 --> 13:41.829
and I've settled for so many things.

13:41.913 --> 13:46.876
If I had died today, my obituary
would've read, "Survived by Randy."

13:47.460 --> 13:48.461
Shit.

13:50.505 --> 13:54.259
- I think I have to end it.
- You're gonna break up with him?

13:54.342 --> 13:57.345
I prefer to think of it
as setting us both free.

13:57.429 --> 13:58.471
Here's my advice.

13:58.555 --> 14:01.849
Do it over text, and then block his number
so he can't yell at you.

14:01.933 --> 14:04.852
No. I owe him the respect
of doing it in person.

14:04.936 --> 14:08.356
Maybe I'm naive, but I feel like I could
do it in a way where, at the end of it,

14:08.440 --> 14:11.443
- he actually feels better about himself.
- Seriously?

14:11.526 --> 14:13.326
Yeah, I've got a knack
for this sort of thing.

14:13.403 --> 14:15.822
Once I had to fire someone,
and it took hours,

14:15.905 --> 14:18.991
but we ended up talking about everything,
everything in our lives.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.411
- And we still e-mail today.
- About what?

14:21.494 --> 14:25.540
About the fact that I fired him
and he can't get work anymore.

14:25.623 --> 14:27.500
But it's friendly. It's good.

14:27.584 --> 14:28.668
[rock music playing]

14:28.751 --> 14:30.670
- [Natasha] Whoo!
- Let's do it.

14:30.753 --> 14:35.007
- Hey, Tash, make, uh, Gus another drink.
- Oh, Gus needs another drink.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.844
No, I got a couple more sips
left here that I'm...

14:37.927 --> 14:40.638
- Oh, I think we can fill it up!
- [Steven] Come on.

14:40.722 --> 14:42.056
- Okay.
- [Natasha chuckles]

14:42.139 --> 14:44.601
- Come on, let's turn on some real music.
- [Natasha] Yeah.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.269
- Hey, Gus?
- [Gus] Mmm-hmm?

14:46.353 --> 14:48.605
This little line's got your name on it.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.499
- [dance music playing]
- I haven't eaten dinner.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.443
- [laughs]
- [Steven] Oh, come on, it's Atlanta.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.778
- Yeah, Gus, it's Atlanta. [laughing]
- Oh, well...

14:55.862 --> 14:58.365
I don't know why that matters,
but... [chuckles]

14:58.448 --> 14:59.907
[both] 'Cause it's Atlanta.

14:59.991 --> 15:03.536
[singsong] It's Atlanta! It's Atlanta!
It's Atlanta!

15:10.502 --> 15:12.587
- [Natasha] Ooh!
- You guys are having fun.

15:12.670 --> 15:14.464
Uh-oh, here she comes!

15:17.509 --> 15:19.469
We all have to do this.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.514
'Cause if you don't do it,
we'll feel like you're judging us.

15:22.597 --> 15:24.724
Yeah, don't judge us, Gus!

15:26.684 --> 15:27.685
Ah!

15:27.769 --> 15:29.771
Ooh! Yes!

15:33.941 --> 15:35.568
[speaking indistinctly]

15:35.652 --> 15:37.779
[babbling]

15:37.862 --> 15:41.115
I remember when I was a kid,
my family and I, we would go to church,

15:41.198 --> 15:43.034
and I, like, loved Jesus.

15:43.117 --> 15:46.371
- That's so sweet.
- Jesus was, like, my best fucking friend,

15:46.454 --> 15:48.790
and I feel like I don't even talk
to Jesus anymore.

15:48.873 --> 15:52.126
When was the last time you guys
talked to Jesus? Do you wanna pray?

15:52.209 --> 15:54.211
- Uh...
- No fucking way.

15:54.296 --> 15:56.130
- Not right now.
- Yeah.

15:56.213 --> 15:59.801
- [Gus] I'm gonna just pray real quick.
- You need another drink.

15:59.884 --> 16:01.886
[coughing]

16:03.095 --> 16:05.014
Hey, we're gonna take off, man!
You good?

16:05.097 --> 16:06.308
Okay!

16:07.309 --> 16:10.603
- Bye, buddy!
- It was nice to meet you!

16:10.687 --> 16:13.105
- [Steven] All right.
- [Gus retching and coughing]

16:13.189 --> 16:14.316
Hey!

16:14.399 --> 16:15.775
[laughs]

16:25.493 --> 16:26.619
[cell phone chimes]

16:39.507 --> 16:40.800
[knocking on door]

16:44.220 --> 16:45.221
Hey!

16:45.305 --> 16:47.348
[screaming and clanging over headphones]

16:54.271 --> 16:56.358
- Hi!
- Oh, hey!

16:56.441 --> 16:58.401
- Sorry I scared you.
- [groans]

16:58.485 --> 17:01.195
- Whoa! [chuckles]
- That's okay.

17:02.196 --> 17:04.449
When I saw you,
I thought you were my neighbor Kelly.

17:04.531 --> 17:07.368
He loves to prank me.
I fucking hate that guy.

17:07.452 --> 17:09.329
- Okay.
- What's going on?

17:09.412 --> 17:13.458
Um, well, I actually have
some really exciting news for you.

17:13.540 --> 17:16.167
Something that's gonna
open up your life in many ways.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.339
That sounds great.
What did we, like, win something?

17:19.422 --> 17:22.425
We did not.
Um, I'm breaking up with you.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.843
- What?
- Hear me out.

17:23.925 --> 17:25.094
Um, this break up,

17:25.176 --> 17:28.890
it's actually gonna give you
a lot of really exciting opportunities

17:28.973 --> 17:30.224
to meet new people.

17:31.142 --> 17:34.145
It's time for you
to take your wings and soar,

17:34.228 --> 17:38.816
because, um, you're ready,
and I can't hold you back.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.067
[toilet flushing]

17:40.943 --> 17:43.946
- Oh, I didn't realize someone was here.
- Oh, hey.

17:44.030 --> 17:46.699
Bertie, this is my brother, Devon.
Surprise visit.

17:46.783 --> 17:48.159
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:48.242 --> 17:49.911
- Uh, sorry, they're wet.
- Very wet.

17:49.994 --> 17:51.413
Oh, they're clean. [chuckles]

17:51.496 --> 17:54.081
- Very wet.
- He, uh... he loves surprises.

17:54.165 --> 17:56.418
- I hate surprises.
- Since he was a kid.

17:56.501 --> 17:59.003
Oh, Bertie, it is so cool
to finally meet you,

17:59.086 --> 18:01.088
'cause this guy
won't stop talking about you

18:01.172 --> 18:04.133
and my mom's already
told all her friends about you.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.718
Bertie just broke up with me.

18:07.720 --> 18:11.265
- For real? Why?
- I'm sorry, but I...

18:11.348 --> 18:13.518
Look, can't you give him
another chance, please?

18:13.601 --> 18:15.241
I mean, this means so much to our family.

18:15.311 --> 18:16.991
Is this because I borrowed money from you?

18:17.021 --> 18:20.316
What the hell are you doing?
You should only borrow money from family.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.026
Okay, how much?

18:22.109 --> 18:25.112
I mean, I got, like, 60 bucks on me,
but I'm happy to run to an ATM.

18:25.196 --> 18:27.490
- No problem.
- Dude, I'm not an invalid.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.116
You are breaking Mom's heart.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.326
- Me?
- I am?

18:30.410 --> 18:32.829
- Both of you!
- Okay, well, um...

18:32.912 --> 18:34.163
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna go.

18:34.246 --> 18:37.750
No, please don't go, okay? Just...
Let's work this out.

18:37.834 --> 18:39.994
There's a lot of great stuff
that you still don't know.

18:40.044 --> 18:42.797
[stammers] Little kids love me, right?

18:42.880 --> 18:44.966
And... I can pick up really heavy stuff.

18:45.049 --> 18:47.469
Oh, stop it, dude.
You're humiliating yourself.

18:47.552 --> 18:50.221
Listen, one summer,
I got all my mom's old jeans

18:50.304 --> 18:52.014
and donated them
to this women's shelter...

18:52.098 --> 18:53.858
- Shut up.
- and people thought I was a hero.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.893
- You shut up!
- Nobody thought you were a hero!

18:55.977 --> 18:57.311
- Yes, they did, Devon.
- Shut up!

18:57.394 --> 18:58.997
- [Randy] Shut up!
- I wish you the best. Sorry. Bye.

18:59.021 --> 19:01.148
- [Randy] Don't leave!
- [Devon] Oh, my God. Don't go.

19:02.233 --> 19:03.586
[Jack] The plan was
to wait for Commander...

19:03.610 --> 19:05.236
[Brad] Screw the plan.

19:05.319 --> 19:07.238
We're two clicks away
from a downed jet airliner

19:07.321 --> 19:10.825
carrying the president's daughter.
The feds are gonna be all over us.

19:10.908 --> 19:13.495
[Jack] Commander said
he wanted us to wait right here.

19:13.578 --> 19:15.538
Commander ain't here, Jack.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.624
The commander ain't here!

19:17.707 --> 19:19.250
- Cut! Cut!
- [Brad] How was that?

19:19.333 --> 19:21.919
- Was that... better?
- [Gus sighing]

19:22.003 --> 19:23.129
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:23.212 --> 19:24.255
- Morning.
- Morning.

19:24.338 --> 19:28.050
- Do you know when the next break is?
- Why? Do you wanna talk to Victor?

19:29.051 --> 19:30.637
Yeah. I just...

19:31.638 --> 19:34.682
I wanted to let him know why I think
I should be a part of this Arctic movie.

19:34.766 --> 19:36.660
- I just need, like, five minutes.
- Gus, dude...

19:36.684 --> 19:39.812
- I think I can convince him, you know?
- Look, you need to move on, okay?

19:39.896 --> 19:41.523
He doesn't need you anymore.

19:41.606 --> 19:44.400
We bought the rights
to the article you mentioned, so...

19:47.278 --> 19:50.114
Wait... What? Are you serious?

19:50.197 --> 19:52.283
[softly] Hey, can you keep it down?
We're shooting.

19:52.366 --> 19:55.220
You wouldn't have known about that article
unless I had told you about it.

19:55.244 --> 19:57.371
Maybe next time,
you should be more business savvy.

19:57.455 --> 20:00.750
[softly] Business savvy?
This isn't about business, man.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.771
- This is about your feelings towards me.
- We're in the middle of a scene.

20:03.795 --> 20:05.547
You didn't like me from the start.

20:05.630 --> 20:09.592
What are you talking about?
I... I didn't even know you, okay?

20:09.676 --> 20:12.136
And then you come along,
kissing his ass...

20:12.219 --> 20:13.680
I kiss his ass? You kiss his ass.

20:13.763 --> 20:16.098
- No, I don't.
- This is his ass. These are your lips.

20:16.182 --> 20:17.433
- Yeah...
- And I'm, like, here.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.685
No. No, you're...

20:18.768 --> 20:22.438
This is me. You're, like...
like, on top of me.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.733
- [Gus and Tommy continue arguing]
- Hey, hey, hey.

20:26.651 --> 20:29.111
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Pause, pause, pause.

20:29.195 --> 20:33.240
- [man] Still rolling! Resetting!
- I'm... I'm sorry. I just...

20:33.324 --> 20:35.367
- I didn't mean to...
- [speaking Korean]

20:35.451 --> 20:37.328
Yeah, he wants you to leave the set.

20:37.411 --> 20:39.581
Yeah, like I can trust
anything you translate.

20:39.664 --> 20:42.041
- [speaking Korean]
- Forever.

20:44.418 --> 20:46.629
[softly] Forever. Go forever.

20:49.841 --> 20:51.801
- He said, "Go forever."
- I heard. I know.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.470
- [man] Still rolling!
- [Victor] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

20:55.012 --> 20:56.639
[man] Quiet! Resetting!

20:56.723 --> 20:58.265
[organ playing]

21:39.015 --> 21:40.141
[clicking]

21:43.560 --> 21:46.438
- Fucking shit.
- [continues clicking lighter]

22:04.624 --> 22:07.084
[Dustin] Almost there.
It's just a little farther up.

22:07.168 --> 22:09.253
[Wade] I just don't think
snakes are that scary, man.

22:09.336 --> 22:12.423
[Dean] Well, my cousin saw one once.
Not here, but he saw... Hey.

22:12.506 --> 22:13.549
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:14.466 --> 22:15.467
Hey.

22:17.553 --> 22:20.056
- You know those guys?
- Uh, friends of a friend.

22:20.389 --> 22:22.934
- Where we going?
- Right here. [sighs]

22:23.017 --> 22:24.727
This was Buster's favorite spot.

22:26.187 --> 22:27.396
[sighs]

22:34.111 --> 22:35.863
[indistinct chatter]

22:42.036 --> 22:45.039
[man] So there I am, once again,

22:45.122 --> 22:49.668
driving my mother home
because she's too wasted to drive.

22:49.752 --> 22:54.006
And, um, I'm just about to tell her
how fucking sick of this I am.

22:54.506 --> 23:00.805
And then I stop
and remind myself of, uh, the don'ts.

23:00.888 --> 23:06.769
Don't nag, scold or complain.
Don't push anyone but yourself.

23:06.853 --> 23:10.606
Don't, uh... don't keep checking up
on the alcoholic.

23:12.441 --> 23:13.860
Don't be overprotective.

23:14.777 --> 23:17.113
And when I got to the end of that list,

23:18.364 --> 23:21.742
<i>I was able to let go of the anger...</i>

23:22.827 --> 23:24.496
<i>and just love my mom.</i>

23:28.540 --> 23:30.501
[both breathing heavily]

23:35.464 --> 23:38.592
I can't keep checking up on her.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.263
Sometimes that's the hardest part.

23:42.346 --> 23:45.808
I have to remember
that the best thing I can do...

23:45.891 --> 23:50.062
is let go of all the things
that I can't change

23:50.562 --> 23:54.817
and start thinking
about the things that I can.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.610
[breathing heavily]

23:59.906 --> 24:01.949
[Gus] <i>I've been seeing this girl.</i>

24:02.033 --> 24:05.620
<i>We've been dating, and she's an alcoholic.</i>

24:05.702 --> 24:11.124
<i>And... lately I've been feeling her,
like, pulling away from me.</i>

24:13.878 --> 24:15.046
<i>Now I get it.</i>

24:17.799 --> 24:18.883
<i>I get it.</i>

24:20.802 --> 24:24.514
<i>I've just been, like, putting...</i>
[inhales deeply]

24:24.596 --> 24:28.059
so much pressure on her to get better.

24:30.978 --> 24:32.855
So I'm gonna take a step back...

24:34.648 --> 24:37.693
let her handle her own recovery,
and, um...

24:39.695 --> 24:41.280
maybe if I do that...

24:45.534 --> 24:46.869
we'll have something real.

24:55.461 --> 24:57.379
- [Mickey] Hey there.
- Hi.

24:57.463 --> 24:59.256
- How'd it go with Randy?
- Oh...

24:59.340 --> 25:01.508
It was worse than I could have imagined.

25:01.592 --> 25:03.510
It was a little bit
like watching a horror movie

25:03.594 --> 25:05.554
and being in the horror movie as well.

25:05.637 --> 25:09.225
- And you're already on Tinder.
- Oh, yeah. I'm liking everyone.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.908
Uh, what does it mean when someone says
they're a project manager?

25:11.978 --> 25:13.437
They're unemployed.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.023
If it says project manager or CEO,
they're unemployed.

25:16.107 --> 25:18.234
Oh, okay. Well,
they're still getting a like from me.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.402
Don't do that! They're all gonna text you.

25:20.486 --> 25:22.086
That's good. It'll make me feel popular.

25:22.113 --> 25:24.198
I've only got, like,
seven people in my phone.

25:24.281 --> 25:26.325
- [knocking on door]
- I'll get it.

25:30.329 --> 25:32.123
- [Dustin] Hey.
- [Mickey] Hi.

25:32.206 --> 25:33.958
- Spontaneous drop-by.
- Yeah.

25:34.041 --> 25:36.210
I was in the neighborhood,
grabbed some artichokes.

25:36.293 --> 25:38.438
These things are so expensive,
they should come with a handjob.

25:38.462 --> 25:40.047
- [chuckles]
- Uh, hi.

25:40.130 --> 25:41.130
Hello.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.801
Oh, sorry. Uh, Bertie, this is Dustin,
an old friend of mine.

25:44.886 --> 25:47.304
And Dustin, this is Bertie, my roommate.

25:47.388 --> 25:50.057
- Roommate and future old friend.
- [Mickey chuckles]

25:50.766 --> 25:52.643
You, uh, hungry? I'll cook these up.

25:52.726 --> 25:55.354
- Oh, wow. That's so nice of you.
- Happy to help.

25:56.272 --> 25:58.357
Oh, my God. This is your kitchen?

25:59.275 --> 26:00.567
Maybe this was a mistake.

26:00.651 --> 26:02.111
[Mickey and Dustin chuckle]

26:03.028 --> 26:05.281
So how do you two know each other?

26:05.364 --> 26:08.450
- Mmm... Mickey and I used to date.
- [Bertie] Oh.

26:08.534 --> 26:10.161
I knew her back in her mohawk days.

26:10.786 --> 26:13.664
- Ah, you had a mohawk?
- Not really.

26:13.747 --> 26:17.209
It was more like I was on speed
and cut my hair with a Swiss Army knife.

26:17.293 --> 26:19.045
Oh, my God, it was gorgeous.

26:20.004 --> 26:22.423
You're even more gorgeous now.
I like this look.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.551
Jesus, these artichokes are good, right?

26:25.634 --> 26:29.138
Oh, yeah. I'm a bit worried
I'm gonna arti-choke on them though.

26:29.221 --> 26:32.349
[chuckles] Okay. Um, well,

26:32.433 --> 26:38.355
I'm gonna, uh, go into my room
and pack up Randy's stuff. Bye.

26:39.982 --> 26:40.983
You're welcome.

26:42.693 --> 26:43.986
[scoffs]

27:00.586 --> 27:03.172
- So what's up?
- I don't know. What is up?

27:03.255 --> 27:06.508
Nothing. I'm a grown woman
having dinner with a friend.

27:06.592 --> 27:08.094
A very touchy friend.

27:08.177 --> 27:09.928
All right, yes, we've been fucking.

27:10.012 --> 27:12.639
- What do you care? You barely know me.
- What about Gus?

27:12.723 --> 27:16.893
I've known Gus for, like, two months,
and we never said we are exclusive.

27:17.478 --> 27:21.523
- Well, hmm...
- What's "hmm" mean?

27:21.607 --> 27:23.985
Nothing, it's...
I think if I were in the same situation,

27:24.068 --> 27:25.694
I would do things a little differently.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.380
Of course you would,
'cause you're so perfect.

27:27.404 --> 27:30.116
I'm not saying I'm perfect.
I'm just looking out for Gus.

27:30.199 --> 27:33.039
You're not gonna tell him, are you?
'Cause it would ruin his whole life.

27:33.077 --> 27:36.580
- I didn't say I was gonna tell him.
- Don't. Ever.

27:36.663 --> 27:39.416
Maybe if you'd ever been in,
like, a real adult relationship,

27:39.500 --> 27:40.626
you would understand.

27:40.709 --> 27:42.461
Excuse me. I was engaged once.

27:42.544 --> 27:44.296
In Australia. It doesn't count.

27:45.256 --> 27:46.548
[door slams]

27:46.632 --> 27:49.426
Hey, I, uh... I spilled some wine.
Do you have any paper towels?

27:49.510 --> 27:51.970
- Just leave it.
- Just leave it?

27:52.054 --> 27:54.973
Yeah. This place is toxic.
Let's go to your house.

27:55.974 --> 27:57.226
Um, okay.

27:58.227 --> 27:59.645
[door opens]

28:00.937 --> 28:02.814
- [Steven] Uh-oh!
- Hey, hey!

28:03.732 --> 28:07.361
Guys, I just wanted to say goodbye.
I'm flying out tomorrow morning, so...

28:07.444 --> 28:09.030
- [Steven] Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

28:09.113 --> 28:11.553
Do you feel better?
You didn't look great last time I saw you.

28:11.615 --> 28:15.827
I don't know. I think over the last week,
maybe I just... had some...

28:15.911 --> 28:19.623
life-changing breakthroughs,
honestly. You know?

28:19.706 --> 28:22.226
I meant last time I saw you,
you were throwing up in the toilet.

28:22.293 --> 28:23.294
What?

28:23.377 --> 28:25.629
- Uh...
- When did that happen?

28:25.712 --> 28:27.381
[chuckles] Oh, um...

28:27.464 --> 28:29.234
- [Steven] When did that happen?
- What was that?

28:29.258 --> 28:32.636
That was probably a couple of nights ago.
You were snoozing away,

28:32.719 --> 28:34.805
and I went over to his room
to watch <i>Ride Along 2.</i>

28:34.888 --> 28:36.116
- [Gus] That's right.
- [Steven] Remember?

28:36.140 --> 28:39.560
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
and I just... I got sick from...

28:40.227 --> 28:42.896
- 'Cause you had, um, that meatball sub.
- I had the meatball sub,

28:42.979 --> 28:44.356
and it was just food poisoning.

28:44.440 --> 28:47.026
You don't have to bullshit me.
I know what you're talking about.

28:47.109 --> 28:48.235
- [laughs]
- [Gus] Oh.

28:48.319 --> 28:52.364
- When did somebody learn the "BS" word?
- You probably had one beer and passed out.

28:52.448 --> 28:54.950
- [both chuckle]
- I'm a lightweight now, huh?

28:55.034 --> 28:56.910
Do as I say, not as I do, okay?

28:56.993 --> 28:59.330
Okay, now I'm uncomfortable.
I'm gonna go.

28:59.413 --> 29:00.682
- Okay.
- All right, we lost her.

29:00.706 --> 29:02.083
- Yep. Bye!
- Okay, see you, buddy.

29:02.166 --> 29:04.793
- [romantic music playing]
- [Randy inhaling deeply]

29:04.877 --> 29:06.378
You still have the same smell.

29:07.213 --> 29:10.716
[Bertie] I actually don't like
to think of myself as having a smell.

29:10.799 --> 29:12.968
- Thank you, though.
- [Randy chuckles]

29:15.054 --> 29:16.430
Is it the word smell?

29:16.513 --> 29:19.141
Could I say, like,
you still have the same odor?

29:19.225 --> 29:21.060
I would prefer that you did not.

29:21.143 --> 29:22.186
Got it.

29:26.231 --> 29:28.484
I should probably
let my brother back in soon.

29:38.869 --> 29:41.747
[Mickey exhales heavily] This is so nice.

29:42.664 --> 29:45.292
I wish I could stay here all day
and I didn't have to go to work.

29:45.959 --> 29:47.253
That sounds perfect.

29:48.504 --> 29:51.465
I'm kinda killing it at my job lately.

29:51.548 --> 29:54.301
Should make me happy. [breathes deeply]

29:54.385 --> 29:56.803
But it's just more pressure, you know?

29:56.887 --> 30:00.932
If I can succeed, then I can fail.
Makes me nervous.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.101
I get that.

30:03.310 --> 30:04.436
Honestly...

30:05.687 --> 30:08.815
some part of me doesn't wanna deal
with big career responsibilities.

30:08.899 --> 30:12.403
I just wanna get married
and have kids and live a simple life.

30:13.737 --> 30:15.489
That's awesome.

30:15.572 --> 30:19.243
- It is?
- Completely. I totally get that.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.163
You come from a fucked-up family.

30:22.246 --> 30:25.582
I come from a fucked-up nightmare
of a family.

30:26.583 --> 30:29.753
And when you come from where we did,
sometimes you just...

30:30.671 --> 30:32.756
I don't know, wanna... [takes deep breath]

30:32.839 --> 30:35.342
have your own family
so you can do it all over the right way.

30:35.426 --> 30:39.513
Yes! I just wanna have a happy family,
erase the bad one,

30:39.596 --> 30:43.684
and give my kids
the fucking awesome childhood I never had.

30:43.767 --> 30:44.851
I want that, too.

30:45.977 --> 30:50.607
Like, a... a wife who's home
when the kids get back from school.

30:50.691 --> 30:51.817
I never had that.

30:53.068 --> 30:55.571
I could bake some cookies if I had to.

30:55.654 --> 30:58.907
- They gotta be chocolate chip.
- 'Course! I'm not an animal.

30:58.990 --> 31:01.743
I'm not gonna give my kids
some fucking oatmeal raisin cookies.

31:01.827 --> 31:04.538
[chuckling] Sorry. Sorry.

31:10.377 --> 31:12.003
We're both in better places.

31:15.048 --> 31:16.717
We could give this another try.

31:24.015 --> 31:27.728
I should go home and change my clothes
before I go to work.

31:27.811 --> 31:33.942
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You are not going anywhere.

31:50.626 --> 31:52.043
