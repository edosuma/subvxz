00:14.848 --> 00:18.119
Lamar: Come on, Jerry.
Well, just hear me out.

00:18.152 --> 00:21.189
I-I've written 1,700 new pages
since last week.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.956
Every word is pristine.

00:22.990 --> 00:26.827
I'm telling you, this new,
uh...writer's retreat I found,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.962
oh, it's -- it's really
opened things up for me.

00:28.996 --> 00:31.265
My veins are jacked
with Spiritus Mundi.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.167
I'm drinking
the milk of paradise!

00:33.201 --> 00:35.303
So, please, let me
send you the manuscript

00:35.336 --> 00:37.771
before you make
your final decision.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.873
What?!

00:39.907 --> 00:42.110
No, the plot is
not convoluted.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.945
It's complex,
like a symphony.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.480
Jerry...

00:46.514 --> 00:48.549
[Chuckles] Nope.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.318
Nope, nope.
Wrong again, Jerry.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.852
I don't make mistakes.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.021
It's impossible for a genius
to make a mistake.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.657
His mistakes are
portals of discovery.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.393
Alright, don't -- don't --
don't hang up, please.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.662
I'm sorry.

01:01.695 --> 01:05.032
It's just...[Laughs]
You're my agent.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.335
You're supposed to fight for me,
you useless sack of shit,

01:07.368 --> 01:08.369
and --
[Dial tone]

01:08.402 --> 01:10.371
Jerry?

01:10.404 --> 01:12.240
Jerry?

01:12.273 --> 01:16.009
[Sighs]

01:16.043 --> 01:18.078
[Receiver clacks]

01:18.112 --> 01:19.613
[Sighs]

01:24.218 --> 01:25.052
Who you talking to?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.020
Oh, my accountant.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.423
I'm thinking about buying some
property on the Amalfi Coast.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.892
Italy --
a land kissed by the gods.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.994
Ah, the Italians
are a clownish people.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.429
Haven't won a war
since Gaul.

01:35.463 --> 01:39.267
But the sunsets --
mwah! [Laughs]

01:39.300 --> 01:42.236
Well, shall we "Uno"?

01:42.970 --> 01:46.106
The romance of the road.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.042
I know it well.

01:49.076 --> 01:53.747
All those blistering afternoons
on the high plains.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.050
Going mano a mano with
some wholesaler in Victorville

01:57.084 --> 02:00.254
who wants an extra five off
an order of brass.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.127
That world
could be yours someday.

02:07.161 --> 02:10.097
But in the meantime,
the order desk

02:10.130 --> 02:12.466
is a good place
to learn the biz.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.203
I couldn't agree more.

02:15.236 --> 02:19.573
I was off chasing donkey carts
for a while.

02:19.607 --> 02:23.911
But now I see that
this is a great opportunity

02:23.944 --> 02:25.579
to learn the business
from the ground up.

02:25.613 --> 02:28.549
Now, you can't skip steps.
That's how I learned pools.

02:28.582 --> 02:31.219
And I didn't go to some
million-dollar pool school

02:31.252 --> 02:32.085
back east.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.387
Exactly!

02:33.421 --> 02:35.223
I started out as a stock boy

02:35.256 --> 02:37.925
at a toilet-seat factory
in South El Monte.

02:37.958 --> 02:41.462
I never dreamed
I'd have all of this.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.564
But here I am.
You know what, Bob?

02:43.597 --> 02:46.734
I'm just gonna go ahead
and say it out loud.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.136
I think this interview is
going really well.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.772
And I would love
to be a part of the team here.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.407
Are you kidding?

02:53.441 --> 02:55.643
You have a background
in residential hydronics...

02:55.676 --> 02:57.911
[Scoffs] Yeah.
...and you're Ernie's guy.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.313
[Both laugh]

02:59.347 --> 03:00.748
It's a no-brainer.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.116
[Chuckles]
Welcome aboard, Dud.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.286
Thank you.

This is for...
Liz Dudley.

03:49.997 --> 03:54.368
Chief Financial Officer?

[Package rattles]

03:56.404 --> 04:00.841
[Indistinct talking]

04:00.874 --> 04:03.677
Is this a bad time?

04:03.711 --> 04:05.879
No. I'm muted.

04:05.913 --> 04:09.317
Janet is passing through
a thought crucible.

04:09.350 --> 04:13.521
She's on a conference call.
I'm taking notes.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.924
I mean, I'm obviously  not
taking any notes,

04:16.957 --> 04:17.925
but what's up?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.927
This came for you.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.596
I'm worried it might contain
an explosive device.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.432
What are you
talking about?

04:24.465 --> 04:26.266
Maybe I'm being paranoid,

04:26.300 --> 04:28.502
but that doesn't rule out
the possibility,

04:28.536 --> 04:32.105
however small,
that there's a bomb in there.

04:32.139 --> 04:35.343
Just trying to do my job.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.245
Liz Dudley,
Chief Financial Officer?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.780
Did you already
get promoted?

04:39.813 --> 04:41.081
No.

[Chuckles]

04:51.925 --> 04:55.262
How's it going?
Are you happy?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.865
I'm still not sure exactly
what I'm supposed to be doing.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.533
[Chuckling] Yeah.
Dealing with this package is

04:59.567 --> 05:01.535
the busiest I've been
all week.
I know.

05:01.569 --> 05:04.271
It is kind of weirdly quiet
around here.
Yeah.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.574
I'm sure new projects
will come up.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.576
And besides, I think,
in corporations,

05:08.609 --> 05:14.214
the less you do,
the more important you are.

05:14.247 --> 05:15.783
Yes.

Hey.

05:26.794 --> 05:28.061
You okay?

05:28.095 --> 05:29.763
I was cleaning out
the grease traps

05:29.797 --> 05:30.898

had an accident --

Speedy's legacy.

Good luck.

In 30 years, the dude
never missed a day,

hemorrhoid surgery.

Wow.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.845
Dud, I think Speedy

06:51.879 --> 06:53.814
would've wanted you
to have this.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.248
Oh.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.558
I will.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.060
Ahh!

07:07.094 --> 07:08.095

the new guy?

07:10.297 --> 07:13.433
Oh, my God.
Is this the --

07:13.467 --> 07:16.436
Well, he's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.271
The last guy quit
after one day.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.373
I hope you're tougher than that.
Are you kidding?

07:20.407 --> 07:22.943
This kid fought off a shark.
And a snake.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.545
Well, actually, I didn't
fight off either of them.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.113
They just kind of
attacked me.
Whatever.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.348
Just make sure
you take care of my customers.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.917
Sure.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.252
Don't let beautiful Jeff
intimidate you.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.287
You're beautiful
in your own way.

And you, too, Ernie.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.427
Hey.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.095
Blaise says he's clear
for visitors.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.031
Oh, great. Okay.
We can go after work.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.700
This place where
he's staying...

07:46.734 --> 07:48.235
I don't get what it is.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.870
Um, yeah.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.271
I went there with
El Confidente.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.975
It's like
a brain-company place.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.745
I was thinking more about it
last night, Blaise.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.881
Let's presume that
whoever designed Lodge 49

08:00.914 --> 08:02.983
did so with a purpose.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.053
Well, they wanted someone
to discover the secret library,

08:06.086 --> 08:08.956
but they knew that
only someone with a special mind

08:08.989 --> 08:11.925
would be able to grasp
its allegorical significance.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.094
You know, another world
inside our own.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.963
Or maybe it's just
a dusty old room.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.798
That's ridiculous.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.299
Well, I'm sorry
I told you that stuff.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.135
I came here to forget about it.
I let myself go.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.337
I burned
the map of reality.

08:24.371 --> 08:26.273
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.409
You were given a gift.
Jesus, man.

08:29.442 --> 08:33.280
My lodge in Gainesville is
a goddamn snooze fest.

08:33.313 --> 08:37.184
Run by boring, flaccid men
with no sense of adventure.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.819
I told them this,
and they hated me for it,

08:38.852 --> 08:40.287
but that's what I do.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.190
In life and on the page,
I tell the truth.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.525
Whatever dream I was chasing,
it wasn't worth it.

08:45.559 --> 08:46.794
I hurt my friends.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.429
What, the nail gun?
Oh, come on.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.365
Every man eventually
shoots another man.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.135

08:58.906 --> 09:01.709
My God, look at her.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.143
[Humming continues]

09:03.176 --> 09:05.679
So graceful and demure.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.716
She embodies the feminine ideal
yet...

09:08.749 --> 09:11.652
she remains an enigma.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.722
Genevieve...
can I deal you in?

09:14.755 --> 09:16.489
[Speaking French]

09:21.829 --> 09:23.664
I think that's a no.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.532
I usually summer
in the Luberon,

09:25.565 --> 09:28.535
but my French
is still imperfect.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.303
Blaise. Hi.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.305
Have you been sleeping
the last few nights?

09:32.339 --> 09:36.243
No. Nothing seems
to be working.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.911
I have wall work
later today,

09:37.945 --> 09:39.212
and, uh...

09:39.246 --> 09:41.481
a couple visitors
this afternoon.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.083
Oh, that's good, good.

09:43.116 --> 09:46.053
Lamar, are you staying away
from mirrors and windows?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.989
Mm-hmm.
Yes, I am, okay?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.423
Jesus.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.559
Can I remind you
that I'm here voluntarily?

09:52.592 --> 09:55.162
Of course.
Everyone's here voluntarily.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.530
And I told you,
you don't have to wear the robe.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.532
I'm wearing the robe.
Yeah.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.201
We like the robes.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.241
And I'm getting sick
of talking to the interns.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.277
I wanna see this Parker guy
I keep hearing about,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.345
the man in the mountain.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.347
[Sighs]

10:14.381 --> 10:16.516
So, who's coming to visit?

10:16.549 --> 10:17.885
Ernie and Dud.

10:17.918 --> 10:21.188
Oh, the knight
and squire.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.590
Excelente.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.031

10:31.064 --> 10:32.565
You're amazing.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.467
If, by amazing,
you mean that I'm,

10:34.501 --> 10:37.537
more or less, competent
at doing basic tasks,

10:37.570 --> 10:39.272
then, yes, I am amazing.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.241
[Sighs] I love
your honesty, Liz --

10:41.274 --> 10:42.910
your lurid
self-awareness.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.978
It reminds me
of what I'll be like

10:45.012 --> 10:47.080
when I'm your age.
What?

10:47.114 --> 10:48.982
There's some more paperwork
for you to sign.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.583
Liz, you've arrived

10:50.617 --> 10:52.920
at a transformational moment
for Omni.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.755
We're approaching
the Rubicon.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.056
Are you ready?

10:56.089 --> 10:58.625
Uh...
Say yes.

10:58.658 --> 10:59.960
Answer Janet.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.963
[Sternly] Say yes.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.397
Sure.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.934
Yeah.
I guess.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.336
Oh, by the way,

11:09.369 --> 11:11.604
uh, I got a package
delivered to me.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.807
I was listed
as Chief Financial Officer.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.608
Someone screwed up
somewhere.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.977
Who knows?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.612
Maybe it was delivered
from the future.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.948
Don't you see, Liz?

11:20.981 --> 11:23.316
You came back into my life
for a reason.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.684
I came here because

11:24.718 --> 11:26.653
you paid me and my friends
a lot of money.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.589
Or maybe you're destined
to be our CFO.

11:29.622 --> 11:33.426
Maybe  you're  the savior
Omni needs right now.

11:33.460 --> 11:37.197
Are things not
going well?

11:37.230 --> 11:39.599
Because with the rats
at Shamroxx

11:39.632 --> 11:42.702
and the implosion
at Higher Steaks...

11:42.736 --> 11:45.472
[Treadmill beeps]

11:45.505 --> 11:49.709
Everything is amazing
right now.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.780
But a good general
prepares for every possibility.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.681
The board of directors
only think in linear terms,

11:54.714 --> 11:56.383
but  I  see the whole circle.

11:56.416 --> 11:59.519
The arc of the Janet universe
bends towards profit.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.687
Okay. I'm sorry.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.189
I know this
is your company

12:02.222 --> 12:05.225
and you have to be,
like, on here or whatever,

12:05.258 --> 12:07.394
but I'm having
a really hard time

12:07.427 --> 12:09.462
differentiating
between you

12:09.496 --> 12:13.033
and the gibberish spewing
out of your mouth.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.169
I can't tell, either.

12:16.203 --> 12:19.406
Help me, Liz.

Hello?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.071
Scott?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.339
Hey.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.606
What's up?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.675
Uh, I was gonna
stay here tonight.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.544
Anita, she's...

12:57.577 --> 12:59.346
She's sick of my snoring.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.614
[Chuckles]
She says she can hear it
across the hall.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.684
I can't believe it's happy hour.
I know.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.186
When I got here,
everything was locked up.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.720
I don't know
where Scott is.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.022
It's a good thing
I came by.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.590
We've got a traveling knight
upstairs.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.225
Just arrived from London.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.127
You might have to fight her
for the room.

13:14.161 --> 13:17.264
Clara: I'm sorry
I hadn't called ahead.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.266
Actually, I left
in a bit of a hurry.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.303
Connie, I'm sorry to say
that things are amiss in London.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.238
Amiss?
Mm-hmm.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.274
There's a strange atmosphere
about the lodge.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.443
Everyone below me, or Melinda,
has been sent away.

13:30.477 --> 13:34.414
Jocelyn, Anil,
and some others...

13:34.447 --> 13:37.150
I dunno where they are,
and I dunno who sent them.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.751
And the people
above Melinda?

13:38.785 --> 13:40.087
My superiors?

13:40.120 --> 13:41.654
Well, they're actually
below me in terms

13:41.688 --> 13:42.956
of the layout of the lodge.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.758
But, yeah.
It's all gone quiet.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.560
None of my communiqués
have been answered.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.296
I go down there,
I knock on the door,

13:49.329 --> 13:50.330
and no one answers.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.598
I don't understand.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.600
I've got a strange feeling,
Connie,

13:53.633 --> 13:55.402
that it's all because
of the scrolls.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.904
They're out in the open,

13:56.937 --> 13:59.072
and I've got to act now
to get them back.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.640
I'm gonna need
your help and all.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.743
Of course, but I don't
really know anything new.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.513
There was all this talk
about Mexico when I got back,

14:06.546 --> 14:09.082
but it all seemed
like a dead end.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.351
Then we should find out.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.752
And we should
go down there.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.955
We could make a bit of holiday
out of it.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.689
I'm not gonna lie
to you, Connie,

14:16.723 --> 14:18.025
I've been cooped up,

14:18.058 --> 14:20.160

too much lately.

Yeah, I mean, I've gotten
yelled at a few times

14:49.756 --> 14:51.959

I didn't know parts numbers,

we're here to see  you,  man.

So...

15:10.177 --> 15:11.979
How you doing?
How's your brain feel?

15:12.012 --> 15:14.581
Or that was not
the way to put it.

15:14.614 --> 15:18.051
No, it's good.
It's, uh...

15:18.085 --> 15:21.854
Just trying to calm the waves,
you know?

15:21.888 --> 15:23.590
Blaise, man...

15:23.623 --> 15:27.827
we're happy to see you
taking care of yourself.

don't worry about it.

The lodge is always
there for you, man.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.736
I mean, right now,
it kind of sucks

15:36.769 --> 15:38.171
'cause Scott put up
all these TVs.

15:38.205 --> 15:39.906
It completely
kills the vibe.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.341
Maybe that's for the best.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.544
We gotta stop pretending
the lodge is magic.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.849
Hi.
Ohh. Ernie, Dud,
this is Lamar,

15:49.882 --> 15:52.552

from Gainesville.

to meet fans.

and it's even better

an eternal bond, huh?

16:07.300 --> 16:09.136
Lamar is
L. Marvin Metz.

He's --
He's the master.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.105
You're the master.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.541
Wha-- Y --
You said you were a writer.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.109
I thought you meant
as a hobby.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.745
I assumed
you knew who I was.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.380
Well, my fans go either
one of two ways.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.215
They get arrested trying
to break into my compound

16:22.249 --> 16:24.051
or they play it cool.
[Chuckles]

16:24.084 --> 16:25.418
I figured you were
playing it cool.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.719
No.
Oh.

16:26.753 --> 16:27.987
I had no idea.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.389
I don't read thrillers.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.424
Whoa, now!
Now, they're not just thrillers.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.825
Yeah, yeah.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.627

very important themes,

16:34.661 --> 16:38.298
like history and love
and explosions.

you guys are here.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.170
Yeah! Ah!

all about you.

with L. Marvin Metz,

16:50.510 --> 16:53.080
the greatest writer
of his generation.

feels up for it.

you're paying me.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.738
I dreamed of starting
a global brand,

17:51.771 --> 17:54.541
putting my stamp
on every continent.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.377

17:57.410 --> 17:58.978
Something like that.

18:01.114 --> 18:05.485
I'm the CEO
of a regional conglomerate.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.387
It's sad.

what did you want to do?

18:12.592 --> 18:13.793

I wanted to go places.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.503

in the wilderness

18:26.873 --> 18:30.577

how to survive.

I sort of ran away from home.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.748
I was gone
for two days.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.117
Yeah, I had it
all planned out.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.854
I packed books,
warm stuff, food.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.090
I wasn't trying
to leave home.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.058
Like, I was happy there.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.460
I just...

18:47.494 --> 18:50.129
wanted to see what
it was like on my own.

18:50.163 --> 18:53.600
I stayed the first night
in a bush at El Dorado Park

18:53.633 --> 18:55.568
and the second night
in this tunnel

18:55.602 --> 18:57.537

[Chuckling] Yeah.
It was great.

Well, until I got home.
My poor dad...

and was losing his mind.

checking my room every night,

19:12.685 --> 19:14.954
making sure I was there.

19:14.987 --> 19:19.125
I wanted to tell him
how fun it was, but...

19:19.158 --> 19:24.631
I knew I couldn't
make him understand.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.999
I felt so horrible
for putting him through it.

19:27.033 --> 19:31.404
I knew I could
never do that again.

left California.

and shot the messenger.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.733
[Laughs]

21:06.766 --> 21:08.167
So, it's all
in your head.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.770
Mm.
Every line of
"Operation Oslo."

21:10.803 --> 21:13.606
And the other 22 volumes
of the "Europa Nights" series.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.241
How many more
are you gonna do?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.043
Well, to tell
the story right...

21:17.076 --> 21:19.512
gonna need
at least 100 volumes.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.280
Ooh.
Mm.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.215
Um, Mr. Metz,
can I ask you a --

21:23.249 --> 21:24.751
No, Lamar, Lamar.
Lamar.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.053
Lamar, uh, can I ask you
a literary question?

21:27.086 --> 21:28.087
Mm.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.689
How does a muse work?
Mm.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.190
Like, is Genevieve
your girlfriend?

21:31.223 --> 21:33.259
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
God, no.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.294
No, no, no, no.
It's entirely platonic.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.530
That's the only way
it can work.

21:37.564 --> 21:40.400
Dud, a muse provides
inspiration.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.535
The intoxicating riddle
that lies at the heart

21:42.569 --> 21:43.936
of every great work.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.439
Sex would only
ruin my process.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.241
That's why I haven't ejaculated
in 10 years.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.546
Well, I...

21:53.580 --> 21:54.947
I won't allow myself to

21:54.981 --> 21:57.884
until I finish
the tale of Tom Stone.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.619
Damn.
Mm.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.488
That's commitment.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.055
Yeah, I'm glad
I'm not a writer.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.290
[Laughter]
Yeah.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.458
But I'm glad that
you are, Lamar.

22:05.492 --> 22:06.759
[Laughs]

22:06.793 --> 22:08.728
Yeah. [Clears throat]

22:08.761 --> 22:10.630
Hey, you guys know
where I could score some bennies

22:10.663 --> 22:12.499
around here?
Uh, no.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.733
Oh.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.935
Forget it.
[Chuckles]

22:15.968 --> 22:17.670
Forget it.
Let's eat something.

22:17.704 --> 22:18.938
Ha ha!

22:19.872 --> 22:22.675
Mnh-mnh-mnh.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.011
Zugzwang.

22:25.044 --> 22:25.978
Dud: What?

22:26.012 --> 22:26.913
Zugzwang!

22:26.946 --> 22:28.280
It's a chess term.

22:28.314 --> 22:31.317
This poor fool...
is in zugzwang.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.653
It means he's in
a losing position.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.087
No matter
what choice he makes,

22:35.121 --> 22:37.957
he can only make
his position worse.

22:37.990 --> 22:41.360
"Zugzwang in Zurich"
is volume 10

22:41.394 --> 22:43.095
of the "Europa Nights."

22:43.129 --> 22:46.065
One of my
darkest journeys.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.602
I'm so behind.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.638
I've only read "Prague Paradox"
and "Operation Oslo."

22:51.671 --> 22:52.605
What?
Yeah.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.607
You can't do that.

22:54.641 --> 22:56.308
Well, you have to
read them in order, Dud.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.010
You miss all
the intricate connections.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.211
I'll catch up.
I promise.

22:59.245 --> 23:00.447
Mm.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.681
Zugzwang.

23:01.714 --> 23:04.484
Heard you
the first time, Lamar.

23:04.517 --> 23:08.020
If Tom Stone is
a chess expert...

23:08.054 --> 23:09.288
Mm.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.458
...you must be
a chess expert, too.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.059
[Chuckles]
So you can
write about it.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.962
Believe me, if Tom Stone
knows how to do something,

23:15.995 --> 23:17.897
I know how to
do something.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.232
So you know how to
kickbox and build bombs?

23:20.266 --> 23:21.968
Tom Stone...

23:22.001 --> 23:23.903
c'est moi.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.639
"Madness in Madrid."

23:26.673 --> 23:28.741
Wrote that one
in three days.

23:28.775 --> 23:29.976
[Both laugh]

23:30.009 --> 23:31.578
[Bird squawks]

23:31.611 --> 23:34.581
Wow. Um, so -- so, Blaise
explained everything --

23:34.614 --> 23:37.817
uh, uh, the library,
the egg room, the scrolls,

23:37.850 --> 23:39.586
Ernie's affair.
I'm a Lynx --

23:39.619 --> 23:41.387
He knew he could take me
into his confidence.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.656
El Confidente had a theory
you were a Lynx.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.257
He was right.

23:45.291 --> 23:48.327
All of my books are sprinkled
with Lynxian references.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.498
Anagrams, acrostics,

23:51.531 --> 23:54.701
the book within the book,
so to speak.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.570
Now, have you heard anything
from El Confidente

23:57.604 --> 23:59.205
and, uh...
what's her name?

23:59.238 --> 24:00.206
The big coin nut?

24:00.239 --> 24:02.041
Oh, Daphne.
Uh, no.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.876
That ship has sailed,
and it's probably for the best,

24:03.910 --> 24:06.045
'cause all that scroll stuff
just ended up

24:06.078 --> 24:07.714
tearing Blaise apart,
you know.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.348
And right now,
it just feels really good

24:09.381 --> 24:10.550
to be, like, stable.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.752
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
[Bird squawks]

24:12.785 --> 24:14.420
Some men lose their nerve

24:14.453 --> 24:16.889
when they get too close
to the truth.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.191
I don't know what that's like,
but I feel for Blaise.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.960
He's a good man.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.963
This is a beautiful map.

24:23.996 --> 24:25.898
Tell me about the hole.

24:25.932 --> 24:28.868
Long story.
Basically, I punched it.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.870
It screwed up my hand.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.072
Oh, you did way more
than that, Ernie.

24:33.105 --> 24:34.974
I did?

24:35.007 --> 24:36.543
Mm-hmm.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.378
Signs and symbols,
my friend.

24:39.411 --> 24:41.948
Don't you see?

24:41.981 --> 24:43.583
Blaise misread
the signs.

24:43.616 --> 24:46.485
He doesn't understand
the true meaning of the scrolls.

24:46.519 --> 24:49.989
I mean, a secret formula for
completing the magnum opus

24:50.022 --> 24:52.992
that opens the door to
some magical unseen world?

24:53.025 --> 24:55.562
[Chuckling] I mean...
That's insane.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.964
Yeah, when you think about it,
it does seem kind of nuts.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.465
[Chuckles]
When in reality,

24:59.498 --> 25:01.801
it should be clear
to any intelligent man

25:01.834 --> 25:05.605
that the scrolls are a map
to the center of the Earth.

25:08.307 --> 25:10.810
Merrill knew the greatest secret
of all, gentlemen --

25:10.843 --> 25:14.280
[Sternly]
the Earth is hollow.

25:14.313 --> 25:18.084
Now, there's an entire world
beneath our feet.

25:18.117 --> 25:21.520
Now, is this world where
the myth of Atlantis comes from?

25:21.554 --> 25:23.289
Possibly,
but what is certain

25:23.322 --> 25:25.191
is that Merrill
discovered a way in.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.993
Lamar, I'm not expert,
but I'm pretty sure

25:27.026 --> 25:28.761
the center of the Earth
is just rock and fire.

25:28.795 --> 25:32.164
[Laughs] In your heart,
you know the Earth is hollow.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.465
That's why you
punched the map.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.534
I was drunk and pissed off.
Nonsense!

25:35.568 --> 25:37.837
It was a premonition!

25:37.870 --> 25:40.773
You were desperate to
get beneath the surface

25:40.807 --> 25:42.474
and see the truth!

25:42.508 --> 25:45.044
Just like me.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.016
[Birds chirp in distance]

25:50.049 --> 25:51.283
Ho!

25:51.317 --> 25:53.653
Guys, you have
to believe me!

25:53.686 --> 25:55.221
There's a better world
than this one.

25:55.254 --> 25:58.190
We just need to dig
through the mud and find it.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.959
Do you believe me?!

25:59.992 --> 26:01.694
Okay.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.462
If you need more proof,

26:03.495 --> 26:05.497
take me to your lodge.

26:05.531 --> 26:08.300
Do you think I like making
your lives a living hell?

26:08.334 --> 26:10.536
Well, the answer is yes!

26:10.569 --> 26:12.538
And it's not because
I'm some sicko

26:12.571 --> 26:16.342
that gets off
by inflicting pain.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.845
It's beca--
[Screaming]

26:18.878 --> 26:20.847
[Team murmurs]

26:20.880 --> 26:24.016
Aah!

26:24.050 --> 26:26.518
Whoo!

26:26.552 --> 26:30.022
**

26:30.056 --> 26:31.824
So, how does
this work?

26:31.858 --> 26:33.392
We just sit here

26:33.425 --> 26:36.495
and watch whatever show
you select?

26:36.528 --> 26:38.197
Yes.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.734
That's generally how
watching TV works.

26:41.768 --> 26:42.902
[Sighing] Sorry.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.271
I've never
really done that.

26:45.304 --> 26:46.673
Mother and father
always said

26:46.706 --> 26:49.041
watching television
thwarts ambition.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.410
Yeah.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.913
Yeah, it does.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.381
Mmm.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.449
[Laughing]

26:57.483 --> 27:00.119
[Laughs]

27:00.152 --> 27:01.754
See? Look.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.890
Merrill always hides the truth
in plain sight.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.258
Look what's beneath him.
An entire cosmos!

27:06.292 --> 27:08.094
As above, so below.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.763
Come on, guys.
That's what that means.

27:10.797 --> 27:13.099
Now, how do
we get there?

27:13.132 --> 27:15.601
Obviously, there's an entry
point at the South Pole,

27:15.634 --> 27:18.470
but it's likely he discovered
other portals, as well.

27:18.504 --> 27:20.572
There could be one
here in Long Beach.

27:20.606 --> 27:23.075
And so then, that means
that the true Lodge --

27:23.109 --> 27:25.377
Is inside
the hollow Earth.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.446
Yes.
Wow.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.148
**

27:29.181 --> 27:31.250
Connie!
Good to see you.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.452
Oh, hey, guys.
This is Clara.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.421
She's --
Ah, let me guess.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.456
She's your new lover.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.958
No.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.560
She's a friend from London,
a traveling knight.

27:41.593 --> 27:43.329
Ah.
Forgive me, Connie.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.832
It was my understanding
that you have many lovers.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.166
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

27:47.199 --> 27:49.235
Mm.
You know my work.

27:49.268 --> 27:50.970
I do?

27:51.003 --> 27:54.173
Connie...
this is L. Marvin Metz.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.607
Holy shit.

27:55.641 --> 27:58.077
The guy who writes
those horrible thrillers.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.747
Horrible? Connie,
we're talking about --
No, no, no, no, no.
Ernie, it's okay.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.248
It's okay, it's okay.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.951
My muscular style
alienates female readers.

28:04.984 --> 28:07.286
That's why I publish erotica
under the pseudonym

28:07.319 --> 28:08.788
Melonia Delacroix.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.322
Clara: Are you serious?
Mm.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.858
You wrote
"The Heiress of Zanzibar"?

28:11.891 --> 28:15.027
[Laughs]
I read the entire sextet.

28:15.061 --> 28:17.363
What?
They're fun.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.866
And genuinely
stimulating.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.471
Can I buy you
ladies a drink?

28:26.906 --> 28:28.674
[Jazz music plays indistinctly]

28:28.707 --> 28:30.509
So, this dude

28:30.542 --> 28:32.444
is the greatest living writer
in America?

28:32.478 --> 28:34.013
Yeah.
Lamar's a genius.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.447
Absolutely.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.183
How else could he write
so many books?

28:37.216 --> 28:40.119
Yeah.

28:40.152 --> 28:41.487
Okay.

28:41.520 --> 28:44.623
Do you really think
that Lamar, uh...

28:44.656 --> 28:47.526
is serious
about this stuff?

28:47.559 --> 28:51.363
The hollow Earth?

28:51.397 --> 28:54.333
It turns up a few times
in his novels.

28:54.366 --> 28:55.701
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:55.734 --> 28:59.405
But maybe
he's a little bit confused.

28:59.438 --> 29:01.874
Yeah.
You know,
like, what's fact?

29:01.908 --> 29:03.843
What's fiction?

29:03.876 --> 29:05.845
Maybe that's why
he's at Ludibrium.

29:05.878 --> 29:09.081
Yep, yeah, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

29:09.115 --> 29:13.052
Yeah. Okay. But, um...
Let's just --

29:13.085 --> 29:14.720
Let's just think about this
for a second.
Alright.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.889
Remember what
Captain said?

29:16.923 --> 29:18.757
He followed
those gift-basket guys

29:18.791 --> 29:20.359
to a warehouse
that had a bunch

29:20.392 --> 29:22.995
of crazy drilling equipment.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.264
Right?
Right.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.434
Now, he thought
it was for oil,

29:28.467 --> 29:31.703
but there was no oil,
so maybe --

29:31.737 --> 29:34.907
Whoever bought
the Orbis land...
Yep.

29:34.941 --> 29:40.412
...is trying to drill their way
into the hollow Earth.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.448
Yeah.

29:42.481 --> 29:45.451
I don't know.

29:45.484 --> 29:49.421
You wrote over 1,000 pages
in a week?

29:49.455 --> 29:50.622
Jesus Christ.

29:50.656 --> 29:52.124
I've never had
writer's block.

29:52.158 --> 29:55.294
[Chuckles] No. No.
I have the opposite problem.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.864
I can't  stop  writing
brilliant prose.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.131
Yeah.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.367
I know that sounds arrogant,
but, uh...

30:01.400 --> 30:03.035
I can show you the pages.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.470
I'll take your word for it.

30:04.503 --> 30:08.274
My advice, Constance,
write under a pen name.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.943
That way, you can
lead a double life.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.578
Yeah?

30:12.611 --> 30:15.614
You know, your day self,
and, uh...

30:15.647 --> 30:19.385
your night self.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.054
[Chuckles] Yeah.

30:22.088 --> 30:26.225
What the hell
do I know, right?

30:26.258 --> 30:27.826
Lamar, are you okay?

30:27.860 --> 30:29.628
[Sighs]

30:29.661 --> 30:32.331
No.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.033
I'm trapped.

30:36.102 --> 30:40.472
I just keep writing
and writing.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.910
Exhausting all the possibilities
of this world.

30:43.943 --> 30:46.612
[Breathes deeply]

30:46.645 --> 30:51.951
**

30:51.984 --> 30:57.289
**

30:57.323 --> 30:59.158
* Ahhh

30:59.191 --> 31:01.760
A-h-h-h!

31:01.793 --> 31:06.765
* [Vocalizing]

31:06.798 --> 31:08.634
[Body thuds]

31:08.667 --> 31:14.173
Oh, my sales have been
plummeting for years.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.875
My publisher
rejected my last book

31:16.909 --> 31:20.446
'cause I refused to
cut it down.

31:20.479 --> 31:23.649
I called it turgid
and repetitive.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.887
Turgid and repetitive.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.959
You know,
my agent dropped me.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.860
But I thought
they were all fools,

31:34.893 --> 31:40.066
blind at the scope and majesty
of my vision, but, uh...

31:40.099 --> 31:42.534
maybe they're right.

31:42.568 --> 31:46.172
Maybe I've been telling
the same story over and over.

31:49.375 --> 31:53.479
My, uh, therapists here think
that my hollow-Earth theory

31:53.512 --> 31:54.913
is a...

31:54.947 --> 31:57.316
coping mechanism.

31:57.349 --> 32:01.820
I'm looking
to escape this world.

32:01.853 --> 32:04.190
Windows, mirrors --

32:04.223 --> 32:08.694
maybe one of them is
a portal to someplace new.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.429
[Chuckles]

32:13.532 --> 32:16.568
I guess I got carried away.

32:16.602 --> 32:19.038
Maybe you did, Lamar.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.740
But your books
mean a lot to  me.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.443
All those hours
I spent alone, on the road,

32:24.476 --> 32:27.646
listening to Tom Stone,
I could...

32:38.724 --> 32:41.360
See?
This is what happens.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.895
You chase an impossible dream,
and you end up here.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.531
Blaise, come on.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.633
Man, all you need
is a little rest,

32:47.666 --> 32:49.301
and then you can
go back to the lodge.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.803
I can't go back there.

32:51.837 --> 32:55.041
I'm so sorry, Dud,
I dragged you down with me.

32:55.074 --> 32:58.144
I should've kept
my delusions to myself.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.811
**

32:59.845 --> 33:01.913
Blaise, man...

33:01.947 --> 33:04.950
**

33:08.987 --> 33:11.990
**

33:16.028 --> 33:23.001
**

33:23.035 --> 33:26.038
**

33:30.109 --> 33:31.943
Stop! Hey!

33:31.977 --> 33:34.180
Hello, Janet Price.
I'm sorry, Janet.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.515
I told him to stop,
but he ignored my command.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.950
Wait.
You two know each other?

33:38.984 --> 33:42.121
This is my personal accountant,
Dr. Kimbrough.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.890
Might we have some privacy?
[Laughs]

33:51.197 --> 33:52.998
This is my professional
companion,

33:53.031 --> 33:54.100
Liz Dudley.
[Door closes]

33:54.133 --> 33:55.801
We have no secrets.

33:55.834 --> 33:59.538
We know each other.
I temp for you.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.140
I shredded
a bunch of stuff.

34:01.173 --> 34:04.843
I watched you
get arrested by the FBI.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.179
Oh.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.848
Well, I, uh...

34:09.881 --> 34:12.050
Um, they --
they let me go.

34:12.084 --> 34:13.819
Because they --
they didn't have any evidence,

34:13.852 --> 34:16.122
and, um...
[Chuckles nervously]

34:16.155 --> 34:18.357
It was a big misunderstanding.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.692
But the whole thing's, you know,
completely behind me now.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.195
[Clears throat]
Why are you here?

34:23.229 --> 34:26.698
After all we've been through,
Janet Price...

34:26.732 --> 34:28.467
you have to ask?

34:28.500 --> 34:32.304
See, I was getting nostalgic
about all those late nights

34:32.338 --> 34:34.640
that we spent together
at your direction,

34:34.673 --> 34:36.041
doing all those...

34:36.074 --> 34:38.977
things that you
instructed me to do.

34:39.010 --> 34:44.650
And I just was kind of
thinking that it might be fun

34:44.683 --> 34:46.418
if we talked in detail

34:46.452 --> 34:50.088
about all the memories
that we share...

34:50.122 --> 34:51.857
together.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.194
I'm not wearing a wire.

34:55.227 --> 34:56.562
She knows.
She totally knows.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.830
So just, uh --
Just come get me, okay?

34:58.864 --> 35:00.732
Okay, just come...
[Door rattles]

35:00.766 --> 35:02.468
Pull it.

35:04.903 --> 35:08.840
[Door slams]

35:08.874 --> 35:10.776
What's going on?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.546
[Telephone rings]

35:19.318 --> 35:20.752
You bet, Mooch. Yep.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.388
I'll track that information
down for you.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.890
Okay.

35:24.923 --> 35:26.425
Hey, uh, Ernie,

35:26.458 --> 35:28.560
Mooch said that he should
get 90-day pricing.

35:28.594 --> 35:31.630
What does that mean?

35:31.663 --> 35:34.900
Ernie?

35:34.933 --> 35:37.736
What's going on?

35:37.769 --> 35:40.306
Nothing.

35:40.339 --> 35:43.074
You're thinking about Blaise,
aren't you.

35:43.108 --> 35:45.744
I just hated seeing him
like that.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.145
Same with Lamar.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.415
Man, I just can't
help but think

35:49.448 --> 35:51.250
that maybe
he'd feel a little better

35:51.283 --> 35:55.086
if he just ejaculated
every now and then, you know?

35:55.120 --> 35:58.390
I'm not a medical professional,
but, uh, I don't know.

35:58.424 --> 36:01.460
I'm stepping outside
of my...

36:01.493 --> 36:03.395
[Sighs] bounds here.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.897
Okay.
[Clears throat]

36:05.931 --> 36:07.833
[Sighs]

36:12.304 --> 36:13.872
Dud...

36:16.107 --> 36:18.176
...we should go to Mexico.

36:18.210 --> 36:23.949
**

36:23.982 --> 36:26.685
What?

36:26.718 --> 36:30.188
It's all zugzwang.

36:30.222 --> 36:34.025
Life is one
big zugzwang.

36:34.059 --> 36:36.027
It doesn't matter
what we do.

36:36.061 --> 36:38.430
We're gonna lose anyway.
[Chuckles]

36:38.464 --> 36:41.867
And you know what?
It's beautiful.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.303
Guys like us --
it doesn't matter

36:44.336 --> 36:47.806
if you make the smart choice
or the stupid choice.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.876
We wind up
worse off anyway.

36:50.909 --> 36:54.212
So we may as well just --
Make the stupid choice!

36:54.246 --> 36:55.347
Yes!
Yeah!

36:55.381 --> 36:58.450
Embrace the zugzwang, baby!
Yeah!

36:58.484 --> 37:01.287
We need to go to Mexico
right now.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.288
For the scrolls!

37:02.321 --> 37:04.356
No. For Blaise.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.659
I don't know what the hell
the scrolls are --

37:07.693 --> 37:10.462
alchemy, Bitcoin,
the hollow Earth --

37:10.496 --> 37:12.564
I don't care!

37:12.598 --> 37:15.634
But I do care
about Blaise.

37:15.667 --> 37:16.968
Yeah.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.837
I love who he is, man.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.138
Yeah.

37:20.171 --> 37:22.741
He needs to hold on
to his dreams.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.710
Yeah.
He's the best guy ever.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.044
Yeah.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.380
He  is  the lodge, man.

37:28.414 --> 37:29.415
Yeah.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.149
And so is Lamar.
Yeah!

37:31.182 --> 37:33.852
And who cares
if we don't find shit?!

37:33.885 --> 37:35.487
Because we'll be
on the road!

37:35.521 --> 37:36.488
Yeah!
Together!

37:36.522 --> 37:38.056
Yeah!
Yeah!

37:38.089 --> 37:40.826
Oh, Ernie, yeah.
Wait. Hold on.

37:40.859 --> 37:43.729
Uh...who's gonna cover
the order desk?

37:43.762 --> 37:45.697
Bob: I will!

37:45.731 --> 37:48.567
I don't know what the hell
you guys are talking about,

37:48.600 --> 37:49.935
but I love it!

37:49.968 --> 37:52.904
Ernie, you got your fire back!
Yeah!

37:52.938 --> 37:55.507
You need to get on the road!
Ernie and Dud: Yeah!

37:55.541 --> 37:57.376
Zugzwang!

37:57.409 --> 37:58.444
Zugzwang, man.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.879
Gentlemen...

38:00.912 --> 38:03.949
I'm willing to finance
this expedition.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.117
On one condition.

38:06.151 --> 38:08.754
You let me bring my muse.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.722
[Speaking French]

38:13.992 --> 38:16.261
Yeah!

38:16.294 --> 38:18.029
Zugzwang!
Zugzwang!

38:18.063 --> 38:21.266
[Laughter, all cheering]

38:22.901 --> 38:25.070
I'm a fraud, Liz.

38:25.103 --> 38:28.440
Omni is a house of cards,
and it's call coming down.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.275
We've been losing money
for a while.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.810
I did everything
I could think of

38:31.843 --> 38:35.046
to keep us afloat --
you know, creative accounting.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.482
Were you stealing
from the company?

38:36.515 --> 38:38.784
You mean,
was I stealing from myself?

38:38.817 --> 38:40.285
Yes, and it hurt.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.622
I can't believe
I let myself do that to me.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.891
I accept your judgment,
Liz.

38:45.924 --> 38:49.961
What am I gonna tell the guys?
They thought I was a hero.

38:49.995 --> 38:53.399
Wait. So, it's all done?
There's nothing you can do?

38:53.432 --> 38:54.633
I need a miracle.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.503
[Door opens]
Lizzie! Hey.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.904
Hello, Dud.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.406
Liz told me that,
as a boy,

39:00.439 --> 39:03.274
you cried
when she ran away.

39:03.308 --> 39:04.843
It touched me.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.445
Who are you?

39:06.478 --> 39:09.415
This is my boss, Janet,
the one I punched.

39:09.448 --> 39:10.849
Oh.
What's up?

39:10.882 --> 39:14.185
Um, I'm here to pack,
because...

39:14.219 --> 39:15.954
we're going to Mexico!

39:15.987 --> 39:17.789
Why are you
going to Mexico?

39:17.823 --> 39:19.491
It's a long story, so...

39:19.525 --> 39:21.993
Tell me.

39:22.027 --> 39:24.930
Harwood Fritz Merrill --
I know that name.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.499
He's an obscure
19th century economist.

39:27.533 --> 39:30.201
His book on management theory
had a big influence on me.

39:30.235 --> 39:31.970
Dude was a polymath.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.805
Yeah, but mostly he's famous
for just starting the Lynx,

39:33.839 --> 39:36.842
and, uh, we've got -- we've got
lodges all over the world.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.611
Okay, now, go back
to the Bitcoin stuff.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.680
These people,
your associates,

39:41.713 --> 39:44.215
they really think the scrolls
could unlock it?

39:44.249 --> 39:45.551
Bitcoin.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.318
How does that
even work?

39:47.352 --> 39:49.120
Liz, trust me,
you don't want to get into it.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.489
Oh, it's not
that complicated.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.691
Basically,
it's a transactional system

39:52.724 --> 39:55.293
where you substitute money
with the idea of money.

39:55.326 --> 39:56.728
Would you please
stop saying "ledger"

39:56.762 --> 39:58.163
like I know what the hell
that means?

39:58.196 --> 40:00.298
Is it a  real  ledger
or not?

40:00.331 --> 40:03.401
What is so hard to understand
about keeping transparency

40:03.435 --> 40:04.636
in the transaction chain?

40:04.670 --> 40:06.538
Liz, I'm taking off.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.807
Okay.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.809
Well, call when
you get down there.

40:10.842 --> 40:12.544
Let me know
you're alright.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.513
Yeah, don't worry about me,
'cause I'm going with Ernie

40:14.546 --> 40:18.550
and everybody, so...

40:18.584 --> 40:21.086
You wanna hug it out?

40:21.119 --> 40:22.854
Yeah.
Alright.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.189
Okay.

40:24.222 --> 40:25.323
Alright.

40:25.356 --> 40:27.759
Janet,  adios.

40:27.793 --> 40:29.461
Janet:  Adios,  Dud.

40:32.097 --> 40:35.601
Well, I asked for a miracle,
and it arrived.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.569
What?
Liz, we need
to go to Mexico

40:37.603 --> 40:39.337
and get in on
this Bitcoin bonanza.

40:39.370 --> 40:40.906
[Laughs]

40:40.939 --> 40:42.340
If that's your only hope,
then there is no hope.

40:42.373 --> 40:43.341
Accept that.

40:43.374 --> 40:44.676
Come on.

40:44.710 --> 40:47.345
This is your chance
to go somewhere.

40:47.378 --> 40:48.680
Plus, you can help
out your friends

40:48.714 --> 40:50.248
and watch out
for your brother.

40:50.281 --> 40:52.684
We can fly down to Guadalajara
tonight in my jet

40:52.718 --> 40:54.352
and rendezvous with Dud
when he gets into town

40:54.385 --> 40:56.354
and has more info.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.857
**

40:58.890 --> 40:59.791
Fine.

40:59.825 --> 41:00.759
Let's go.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.293
Yes.

41:02.327 --> 41:03.762
Pack a bag,
and we'll need to stop

41:03.795 --> 41:05.030
by the office
to get Tarquin.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.264
Oh, my God, Liz!

41:06.297 --> 41:08.767
I am so glad
you said yes to this.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.069
It's so much better
than my other plan.

41:11.102 --> 41:12.804
Other plan?

41:12.838 --> 41:14.472
I was gonna set you up
to take the fall for me,

41:14.506 --> 41:16.942
but none of that matters
because we're friends now

41:16.975 --> 41:19.077
and we're going
to Mexico!

41:19.110 --> 41:20.612
Girls trip!

41:20.646 --> 41:22.213
[Bird chirps in distance]

41:22.247 --> 41:23.549
Wait. What?

41:23.582 --> 41:25.316
Alright.

41:25.350 --> 41:26.985
Oh.

41:27.018 --> 41:33.258
**

41:33.291 --> 41:34.993
Dud: Lamar...

41:35.026 --> 41:37.763
Here you go.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.297
Alright.
That's it.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.600
Groovin'.
Clara.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.603
**

41:44.636 --> 41:46.471
Mm.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.574
[Sighing] Ahh.

41:48.607 --> 41:52.010
Mm.
Let's go, Lamar!

41:52.043 --> 41:53.679
Ah!

41:53.712 --> 42:00.185
**

42:00.218 --> 42:02.487
[Engine starts]

42:02.520 --> 42:05.591
**

42:05.624 --> 42:07.659
Bye, y'all.

42:07.693 --> 42:13.098
**

42:13.131 --> 42:18.469
**

42:18.503 --> 42:21.106
Scott!
Where have you been?

42:21.139 --> 42:23.141
[Sighs]

42:23.174 --> 42:25.844
People know a king
when they see one.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.279
Throne, a robe --
none of that matters.

42:28.313 --> 42:29.881
What?

42:29.915 --> 42:35.053
When people see me,
they see...

42:35.086 --> 42:38.023
They see someone
trying to be a king.

42:38.056 --> 42:42.227
It's just...
pointless.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.895
I'm walking around,

42:43.929 --> 42:45.363
lost.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.366
I don't fit in anywhere.
I've got no purpose.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.736
Yes, you do.

42:54.673 --> 42:57.408
Scott, this is Clara.

42:57.442 --> 42:59.811
She's my friend
from London.

42:59.845 --> 43:02.981
We're going to Mexico
to find the scrolls.

43:03.014 --> 43:04.049
[Sighing] What?

43:04.082 --> 43:09.921
**

43:09.955 --> 43:14.325
Here she comes.

43:14.359 --> 43:16.394
You know,
with the whole FBI thing,

43:16.427 --> 43:19.397
she's taking...
precautions.

43:19.430 --> 43:25.370
**

43:25.403 --> 43:27.038
[Sighs]

43:27.072 --> 43:30.876
**

43:30.909 --> 43:33.178
[Air hissing]

43:33.211 --> 43:38.784
* When they come

43:38.817 --> 43:41.386
* You discover

43:41.419 --> 43:43.254
[Cork pops]

43:43.288 --> 43:45.791
**

43:45.824 --> 43:50.295
* You care inside

43:50.328 --> 43:56.301
* It's like no other

43:56.334 --> 44:02.540
* You never stay

44:02.573 --> 44:08.546
* You never stay

44:08.579 --> 44:11.582
* I'm on the way

44:11.616 --> 44:15.153
* I'm on the way

44:15.186 --> 44:20.726
* We're starting to feel okay

44:20.759 --> 44:24.229
* I'm on the way

44:24.262 --> 44:29.667
* I'm starting to feel okay

44:29.701 --> 44:33.238
* I'm on the way

44:33.271 --> 44:38.409
* I'm starting to feel okay

44:38.443 --> 44:42.147
* I'm on the way

44:42.180 --> 44:47.352
* I'm starting to feel okay

44:47.385 --> 44:50.655
* I'm on my way

44:53.291 --> 44:56.294
**

45:03.034 --> 45:06.037
**

45:12.844 --> 45:15.847
**
