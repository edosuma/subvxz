Ah, he's probably just being
overprotective.

00:30.561 --> 00:32.360
Honestly, Carrie, it's like
you've never had sex.

00:32.363 --> 00:34.814
Well, compared to you,
it feels like I haven't.

00:34.816 --> 00:36.615
Well, you let me know

00:36.617 --> 00:38.067

Who knew this school was so small?

01:43.667 --> 01:47.136
Me. When Maggie and I broke up,
I darted around every corner

01:47.138 --> 01:49.188
like she might be waiting there
to throw something at me.

01:49.190 --> 01:50.973
Luckily, she ended up
being pretty cool about it.

Halloween was a holiday

Looks like we all know

(Chuckles)

02:34.051 --> 02:37.269
So you got any, uh,
special plans for tonight? Nah.

02:37.271 --> 02:40.239
Wow. 'Cause I just heard you
invite someone to a party...

02:40.241 --> 02:41.323
Assuming one you're having.

02:41.325 --> 02:43.058
We should go.

02:43.060 --> 02:44.410
No, it's... it's fine.

02:44.412 --> 02:47.062
Walt and I are going
to a party tonight in the city,

02:47.064 --> 02:48.364
so I don't care.

02:48.366 --> 02:51.333
Just... think it's weird
you didn't invite me.

02:51.335 --> 02:53.068
Would you have wanted me to?

02:53.070 --> 02:55.587
Well, would have been polite.

02:55.589 --> 02:56.905
Look, Carrie,
it wouldn't have been polite.

02:56.907 --> 02:58.507
Would've just been awkward.

02:58.509 --> 03:00.125
We both know that.
Yeah.

03:00.127 --> 03:01.343
Just trying to be honest.

03:01.345 --> 03:03.545
Of course. Right.

03:03.547 --> 03:07.383
Um... well, we should go.

03:09.352 --> 03:12.554
I can't believe Sebastian's
renting out the diner

03:12.556 --> 03:13.772
for a Halloween party.

03:13.774 --> 03:15.274
I can't even escape him in here.

03:15.276 --> 03:17.860
(Sighs) If he had any decency,
he'd switch schools.

03:17.862 --> 03:20.813
Yes, he would. Selfish jerk.
Seriously.

03:20.815 --> 03:22.197
Wait. I'm confused.

03:22.199 --> 03:24.533
You guys don't even feel
a <i>little</i> bad for Sebastian?

03:24.535 --> 03:25.985
Um, <i>no.</i> Why would we?

03:25.987 --> 03:27.119
Because Carrie snooped

03:27.121 --> 03:28.871
through all his private legal files

03:28.873 --> 03:31.156
and told us all
that he slept with his teacher?

03:31.158 --> 03:33.375
Walt, this is what we do.
We get our hearts broken,

03:33.377 --> 03:34.710
and then we demonize the guys
who broke up with us.

03:34.712 --> 03:37.079
Don't worry.
I'm not bad-mouthing you yet.

03:37.081 --> 03:38.831
Um... thanks?
You're welcome.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.782
(Chuckles) I know I made a mistake,

03:40.784 --> 03:42.134
and I wanted to talk
to Sebastian about it,

03:42.136 --> 03:45.254
except he was like,
"discussion's over. I'm out""

03:45.256 --> 03:48.057
I mean, is it my fault
he wouldn't even talk about it?

03:48.059 --> 03:50.759
And what kind of a guy does
that? A jerk. That's what kind.

03:50.761 --> 03:52.778
I say good riddance. If you were
still dating Sebastian,

03:52.780 --> 03:54.063
you'd have to spend Halloween with him.

03:54.065 --> 03:55.097
Now you are footloose
and fancy-free.

03:55.099 --> 03:57.349
And you totally loved
"footloose."

03:57.351 --> 03:58.851
(Chuckles) You know what?

03:58.853 --> 04:00.819
This is the first Halloween
I've looked forward to in years.

04:00.821 --> 04:01.970
I've always had to take care of Dorrit

04:01.972 --> 04:04.740
and keep her from doing
something crazy,

04:04.742 --> 04:06.808
but not tonight.
Tonight you and I are going

04:06.810 --> 04:09.328
to Larissa's Halloween party.
In soho.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.480
And we're not gonna think
about selfish boys

04:11.482 --> 04:13.615
or delinquent little sisters

04:13.617 --> 04:15.034
or any of our responsibilities.

04:15.036 --> 04:16.752
We're just gonna have
an incredible time...

04:16.754 --> 04:18.754
Yeah. And think about ourselves.

04:18.755 --> 04:20.873
It's going to be nothing but fun.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.875
So what are you two going as?
Let's just say

04:22.877 --> 04:25.761
I have a costume that is to <i>"di"</i> for.

04:32.669 --> 04:34.219
(Sighs) Well, I'm glad you're
finally getting a night

04:34.221 --> 04:36.688
out on the town, but I am a little sad

04:36.690 --> 04:39.341
that you won't be taking Dorrit
trick-or-treating this year.

04:39.343 --> 04:42.394
Dad, Dorrit hasn't gone
trick-or-treating in years.

04:42.396 --> 04:44.279
Really?

04:44.281 --> 04:46.065
Well, I guess I miss out on a lot,

04:46.067 --> 04:48.150
being the candy man at home.
Yeah.

04:48.152 --> 04:49.501
Like me chasing Dorrit around town,

04:49.503 --> 04:52.071
trying to stop her from T.P.-Ing
our principal's house.

04:52.073 --> 04:54.957
That is a tradition...
Of sorts.

04:54.959 --> 04:56.875
Super fun one.

04:56.877 --> 04:58.160
Well, it's nice to see you maintaining

04:58.162 --> 04:59.828
a tradition of your own...
Dressing up as Chewbacca

04:59.830 --> 05:01.863
and handing out the goods to kids.

05:01.865 --> 05:03.298
You're Chewbacca every year?

05:03.300 --> 05:05.300
It was an expensive costume.

05:05.302 --> 05:07.536
Besides, I spent a long time getting
the roar just right. (Door opens)

05:07.538 --> 05:09.555
(Imitates Chewbacca's roar)

05:09.557 --> 05:10.722
Lame.

05:10.724 --> 05:12.141
Oh! Dorrit,
get in the picture.

05:12.143 --> 05:14.059
That way, I can get all of you
in your Halloween costumes.

05:14.061 --> 05:15.511
This isn't a costume.

05:16.846 --> 05:18.713
Oh. Well...

05:18.715 --> 05:21.200
Then how about for
old times' sake, huh? Sweetie?

05:21.202 --> 05:22.568
Halloween is stupid.

05:22.570 --> 05:25.687
(Sighs) So I take it
you won't be going out tonight.

05:25.689 --> 05:27.889
Do I look like a loser?

05:27.891 --> 05:30.392
I'll be in my room.

05:32.328 --> 05:34.780
Okay.

05:34.782 --> 05:36.748
Well, this will be fun.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.785
As my last responsible act
before I leave,

05:39.787 --> 05:41.370
I should tell you
that I know that look,

05:41.372 --> 05:43.972
and she's so going out,
and it's not gonna be pretty.

05:43.974 --> 05:45.908
(Chuckles) Dad, I'm serious.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.209
I'd start checking the closets.

05:47.211 --> 05:48.627
Make sure she's not hiding anything

05:48.629 --> 05:52.297
she could use to blow up Castlebury.

05:52.299 --> 05:53.849
(Thud)

05:56.519 --> 05:58.437
You wanna tell me what
you were planning on doing

05:58.439 --> 05:59.605
with all this?

05:59.607 --> 06:02.524
I've never seen that stuff before.

06:02.526 --> 06:04.610
Maybe it's Carrie's?

06:04.612 --> 06:06.228
Okay.

06:06.230 --> 06:08.430
All right, then you won't mind
that I'm taking it

06:08.432 --> 06:10.472

08:35.745 --> 08:38.861
By the way, I just love
your ironic spin

08:38.864 --> 08:40.698
on the whole fairy tale princess
thing. It's <i>brilliant.</i>

08:40.700 --> 08:42.950
Especially since everyone
knows <i>that</i> marriage

08:42.952 --> 08:44.368
is one of convenience.

08:44.370 --> 08:46.337
What do you mean?
Oh, you know.

08:46.339 --> 08:49.406
Charles only married lady Di
because he needed someone royal.

08:49.408 --> 08:52.092
But a friend of mine who knows
the duchess of Kent... mwah...

08:52.094 --> 08:54.545
Who is a bitch... tells me
the prince is still hung up

08:54.547 --> 08:56.013
on some lady from the horsey set.

08:56.015 --> 08:57.297
Camilla Parker...

08:57.299 --> 08:59.299
(Blows raspberry)
Something-or-other.

08:59.301 --> 09:01.752
I saw her picture.
Not attractive.

09:01.754 --> 09:03.804
I don't get it.
That can't be a true story.

09:03.806 --> 09:06.223
Charles and di were meant
for each other.

09:06.225 --> 09:07.975
She's very invested in their romance.

09:07.977 --> 09:09.610
But she got her prince.

09:09.612 --> 09:12.563
I mean, granted, she was
already from the aristocracy,

09:12.565 --> 09:14.365
but... still.

09:14.367 --> 09:16.150
You're serious.

09:16.152 --> 09:18.702
Oh, even better!
You're a romantic!

09:18.704 --> 09:20.788
It's like finding a unicorn.
(Laughs)

09:20.790 --> 09:23.106

I need to show you off.

09:23.108 --> 09:25.743
Oh, no. Wait. (Chuckles)

They are party favors,

You're probably gonna have
a better time than me tonight.

10:39.706 --> 10:40.923
Maybe I should have taken mine.

10:40.925 --> 10:42.507
Would it be weird
if I got down on the floor

10:42.509 --> 10:43.708

10:43.710 --> 10:45.727
(Chuckles) Okay.
You're making me feel better.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.646
Glad to hear it, because this seriously

10:47.648 --> 10:49.564
might be the greatest party
either you or I

10:49.566 --> 10:51.216

just a little.

only one thing missing</i>

11:00.494 --> 11:03.362
<i>for this princess...</i>

11:03.364 --> 11:05.414
A really hot guy named Bennet.

11:05.416 --> 11:09.084
Hey, why don't we find
that "hot boites" guy?

11:09.086 --> 11:10.235
What... what's his name?

11:10.237 --> 11:12.871
Bennet wilcox, and you
totally remember his name.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.290
Didn't wanna sound overenthusiastic.

11:15.292 --> 11:17.009
Let's go find your prince.

11:17.011 --> 11:18.710
That's exactly what I was thinking.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.928
Although now that I hear it said aloud,

11:19.930 --> 11:21.579
it kinda makes me wanna barf.

11:21.581 --> 11:22.881
Mm.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.967
<i>Turns out, I wasn't
the only one feeling that way.</i>

11:24.969 --> 11:27.686
Oh, barf! You wanna go
to Sebastian's party?

11:27.688 --> 11:30.389
No way. I can't believe you
dragged me over here for this.

11:30.391 --> 11:32.357
What happened to laying low tonight?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.608
Well, I was planning on doing just that

11:33.610 --> 11:36.611
until I realized we totally
owe it to Carrie to go.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.980
Are you sure you're not just
looking for something to do

11:37.982 --> 11:39.481
because you're bored?

11:39.483 --> 11:41.733
Okay, so... maybe I was
a little bit bored,

11:41.735 --> 11:43.235
but if we have some drinks
and some fun,

11:43.237 --> 11:44.569
it won't be the end of the world.

11:44.571 --> 11:45.904
If the boy who broke my heart

11:45.906 --> 11:47.939
were to throw a Halloween party,

11:47.941 --> 11:50.492
I'd expect my friends not to go.

11:50.494 --> 11:51.910
You're looking at this wrong.

11:51.912 --> 11:55.047
If we boycott the party,
we won't know what's going on.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.832
If something happens with Sebastian,

11:56.834 --> 11:58.500
Carrie won't hear about it from us.

11:58.502 --> 11:59.718
She'll hear about it from someone else.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.353
Is that what you want?

12:01.355 --> 12:02.454
I guess you're right.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.172
But we're Carrie's best friends.

12:04.174 --> 12:06.091
I mean, Sebastian's
never gonna let us in.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.560
Hi. What's up? I'm glad
you guys could make it.

12:08.562 --> 12:09.710
Come on in.

12:09.711 --> 12:12.314
(Indistinct conversations, laughter)

12:12.316 --> 12:15.150
We're trying to keep
the thinking on the Q.T.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.234
So the owner doesn't get in trouble,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.470
so hard liquor is under booth 4.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.189
And the beer and wine coolers
are under booth 7.

12:21.191 --> 12:22.858
We cool?
Yeah.

12:22.860 --> 12:24.159
All right.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.196
What a jackass.

12:30.199 --> 12:32.200
(Hissing)

12:32.202 --> 12:34.920
Graffiti is <i>the</i> oldest form of protest.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.821
The term actually comes
from ancient Rome.

12:36.823 --> 12:39.424
They used to scrawl it
on the colosseum.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.676
Think of it as outsider art.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.428
It's what gives New York its edge.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.963
The spray can just made it easier.

12:44.965 --> 12:48.433
And silly me, I always thought
it was just vandalism.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.770
Seriously, I wish
I could draw or vandalize.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.005
I don't really have
either in me, I guess.

12:54.007 --> 12:57.893
It's so... beautiful.

12:57.895 --> 12:59.361
He's High, right?

12:59.363 --> 13:00.529
A little.

13:00.531 --> 13:02.030
I'm jealous.
There's nothing better

13:02.032 --> 13:03.448
than watching the act of creation

13:03.450 --> 13:06.952
while under the influence.

13:06.954 --> 13:11.573
So... why don't you tell me
a little about you, princess?

13:11.575 --> 13:15.860
I stopped to wonder if I should
<i>tell him about the real me.</i>

13:15.862 --> 13:18.863
<i>After all, I'd come here
to be a princess for the night</i>

13:18.865 --> 13:20.749
<i>and escape from real life.</i>

13:20.751 --> 13:23.034
<i>That was, until real life
came looking for me.</i>

13:23.036 --> 13:24.136
Carrie!

13:24.138 --> 13:26.704
There you are. I need
someone cozy and yummy.

13:26.706 --> 13:28.423
It has to be you.
Come with me.

13:28.425 --> 13:31.343
Have you been dancing?
You're totally sweaty.

13:31.345 --> 13:33.728
'Cause I'm dewy
and filled with life! Whoo!

13:33.730 --> 13:34.763
Are you coming or not?

13:34.765 --> 13:36.815
Um... I was sort of
talking with Bennet.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.651
Oh, he won't mind. I'm kind of
in the middle of something here,

13:39.653 --> 13:41.653
so I'll just come find you
in a little while, okay?

13:41.655 --> 13:43.989
Fine. I'll be over there,
looking for bird seed.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.074
(Sighs) Where were we?

13:46.076 --> 13:48.160
You were going to tell me
a little bit about yourself.

13:48.162 --> 13:51.696
Right. Well... there's not
much to tell, really.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.165
I'm, uh, from Connecticut.

13:53.167 --> 13:56.067
I wish I was from someplace glamorous

13:56.069 --> 13:57.752
like Charleston or Savannah.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.371
(Lowered voice) Nah.
Southerners have no edge.

13:59.373 --> 14:00.905
But the accents.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.958
(Imitates Southern accent) You
know, charmed, I'm sure. (Clucks)

14:02.960 --> 14:05.710
They had segregated buses
until, like, a year ago.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.629

14:07.631 --> 14:09.681

Aah!

14:09.683 --> 14:11.633

14:14.104 --> 14:17.055
I'm thirsty, oddly, for water.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.974
All right, I should probably
get her something to drink,

14:18.976 --> 14:21.226
except my friend who I came with
is kind of High,

14:21.228 --> 14:23.228
and I don't wanna leave him alone.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.613
I can keep an eye on him.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.565
Are you sure?
I-I don't want to impose.

14:26.567 --> 14:27.866
It's fine. He'll just
stare at the wall,

14:27.868 --> 14:29.601
and I'll socialize around him.
Pretty low impact.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.486
We'll miss you while you're gone.

14:31.488 --> 14:34.606

which barely counts.

We're gonna beat your ass, little man.

28:06.474 --> 28:08.257
And you won't fight back, will you?

28:08.259 --> 28:09.875
'Cause you're homos.

28:09.877 --> 28:13.512
You're disgusting. Okay, you're...
Hey, stop! Leave them alone!

28:13.514 --> 28:15.731
(Man) Come on. Come on.

28:15.733 --> 28:17.766
That has nothing to do with you.

28:17.768 --> 28:18.901
Unless you're one of them.

28:18.903 --> 28:21.770
<i>I'm</i> not.

28:21.772 --> 28:24.406
I'm not.
Just why do you care?

28:24.408 --> 28:26.422
Because they're freaks.

28:38.983 --> 28:41.395
You said you'd look
after him, so what happened?

28:41.397 --> 28:42.563
Did you ditch him?

28:42.565 --> 28:44.548
I didn't ditch him.

28:44.550 --> 28:48.436
What are you doing?

28:48.438 --> 28:50.654
You do realize she's asleep.
No, she isn't.

28:50.656 --> 28:52.189
Yes, she is.

28:53.391 --> 28:55.826
Larissa.
Larissa, wake up.

28:55.828 --> 28:57.728
(Sleepily) I'm a bird.

28:57.730 --> 28:58.913
See? She's awake.

28:58.915 --> 29:00.564
(Snoring)

29:00.566 --> 29:05.569
Okay, well, five minutes ago,
she was into it, all right?

29:05.571 --> 29:07.288
Hello? Lion, out of bed now.

29:08.423 --> 29:10.374
You're molesting someone
who's unconscious.

29:10.376 --> 29:12.259
She was into it.
She kept saying,

29:12.261 --> 29:15.045
"touch my Norma Kamali island"
and stuff.

29:15.047 --> 29:18.466
Mumbling incoherently
does not mean she's into it.

29:18.468 --> 29:20.301
Okay, well, you're kind of a buzzkill,

29:20.303 --> 29:22.052
so I'm gonna head out.

29:22.054 --> 29:25.723
What is <i>wrong</i> with you people
in this city?

29:25.725 --> 29:27.358
Is everyone really so selfish

29:27.360 --> 29:28.709
that they can't even see anybody else?

29:28.711 --> 29:32.363
I mean, look at Larissa.
She's passed out.

29:33.598 --> 29:36.250
Which is how I left her.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.769
I left Larissa here
to get groped by someone

29:38.771 --> 29:41.405
who looks like they're
in the cast of "cats."

29:41.407 --> 29:42.923
This...

29:42.925 --> 29:45.108
This is my fault.
It's not <i>your</i> fault.

29:45.110 --> 29:47.144
It's a party.
You came to have fun.

29:47.146 --> 29:49.663
Larissa got herself into this mess.

29:49.665 --> 29:52.883
Is that your excuse for leaving Walt?

29:52.885 --> 29:54.635
I told you, it wasn't like that.

29:54.637 --> 29:56.804
Walt's the one who ran away from <i>me.</i>

29:56.806 --> 29:58.339
Why would he run away from you?

29:58.341 --> 30:03.978
We were talking, and then...
I don't know.

30:03.980 --> 30:05.429
He just ran.

30:05.431 --> 30:07.431
I guess I should have ran after him.

30:07.433 --> 30:10.968
I thought about it.
I just wasn't sure.

30:10.970 --> 30:12.570
I made a mistake.

30:12.572 --> 30:13.804
I'm sorry.

30:13.806 --> 30:16.407
Yeah.

30:16.409 --> 30:17.691
You're not the only one.

30:21.196 --> 30:24.465
(Sighs) I have to go find Walt.

30:24.467 --> 30:26.500
I can help.

30:26.502 --> 30:29.870
Maybe you should stay here
and look after Larissa

30:29.872 --> 30:31.989
while I go out and look for Walt.

30:31.991 --> 30:34.324
I'm a little afraid
to leave her alone again.

30:34.326 --> 30:36.460
Sure. Of course.

30:36.462 --> 30:38.679
Thanks.

30:43.301 --> 30:46.570
And you better not take
advantage of her while I'm gone,

30:46.572 --> 30:48.606
or I'll come back
and seriously hurt you.

30:48.608 --> 30:50.057
You hear me?

30:50.059 --> 30:51.559
(Chuckles)

30:51.561 --> 30:54.228
Oh, honey.
She's not my type.

30:57.232 --> 30:58.816
Oh.

30:58.818 --> 31:01.118
Okay, good.

31:01.120 --> 31:04.538
I can go... I guess.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.825
<i>I guess my prince charming
wasn't looking</i>

31:07.827 --> 31:11.361
<i>for a princess after all.</i>

31:11.363 --> 31:13.247
All right, everyone quiet down.

31:13.249 --> 31:15.683
I'm gonna need to see
everyone's I.D.S.

31:15.685 --> 31:17.718
Look, dude, it's a private party.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.637
Yes, with underage drinking.

31:19.639 --> 31:23.373
Really? That's how you're gonna
play this?

31:23.375 --> 31:26.760

31:55.124 --> 31:57.207
I just don't know

31:57.209 --> 31:59.877
Well, it was never a good idea.
That's what made it fun.

31:59.879 --> 32:01.929
But it... it's just that
things are different now.

32:01.931 --> 32:05.432
Yeah. Now you can have me

32:05.434 --> 32:06.734
No, Mags,

32:06.736 --> 32:08.385
do you know what would happen

32:08.387 --> 32:12.222
Your dad would kill me, for starters.

32:12.224 --> 32:13.607
He wouldn't be too happy
with me, either.

32:13.609 --> 32:17.594
Yeah, but I would lose my job
or go to jail. Probably both.

32:17.596 --> 32:20.314
I mean, you're in High School.

32:20.316 --> 32:21.598
You could get me
in a lot of trouble here.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.200
And don't you forget it.

32:23.202 --> 32:24.935

and get outta here

32:29.274 --> 32:30.774
and pretend you never saw anything?

32:30.776 --> 32:31.842
I'm a cop.

32:31.844 --> 32:33.627
Everybody out there's drinking.

32:33.629 --> 32:35.045
You guys are all underage.

32:35.047 --> 32:38.332
Didn't stop you from screwing me.

32:43.505 --> 32:45.973
Fine. I'll go.

32:45.975 --> 32:47.591
Yeah.

32:47.593 --> 32:48.842
You will.

32:52.463 --> 32:53.831
(Door closes)

33:05.276 --> 33:07.745
Aah! Dorrit! God.

33:07.747 --> 33:09.029
What are doing?

33:09.031 --> 33:10.781
(Panting)

33:10.783 --> 33:12.499
What's wrong?

33:12.501 --> 33:14.484
I'm just...

33:14.486 --> 33:17.588
Having some trouble
falling asleep, that's all.

33:17.590 --> 33:21.208
Do you think we could maybe...
Hang out a little?

33:21.210 --> 33:24.178
(Sighs) Of course.

33:24.180 --> 33:27.131
That "poltergeist" movie is terrifying.

33:27.133 --> 33:28.349
(Sighs) Yeah.

33:36.107 --> 33:37.558
It's okay.

33:37.560 --> 33:41.645
We're going to be arrested.
We're not gonna be arrested.

33:41.647 --> 33:43.397
They'll be able to tell that
I have pot in my bloodstream,

33:43.399 --> 33:45.282
and now I can never run for senate.

33:45.284 --> 33:47.234
By the time you run for senate,

33:47.236 --> 33:48.369
smoking pot won't be a big deal.

33:48.371 --> 33:49.787
Like that will ever happen.

33:49.789 --> 33:52.122
Hey, stop freaking out.

33:52.124 --> 33:53.540
I handled it. We're cool.

33:53.542 --> 33:56.359
Oh. Thank God.
Thanks.

33:56.361 --> 33:59.029
No problem.

33:59.031 --> 34:01.331
I'm kind of beat. Think I'm
gonna head home. You coming?

34:01.333 --> 34:03.801
I don't know.
Mouse promised me a re-match.

34:03.803 --> 34:05.969
I think maybe I'll stay.

34:05.971 --> 34:07.971
(Whispers) I'm finally starting
to have some fun.

34:07.973 --> 34:10.306
Don't worry.
I'll take care of her.

34:10.309 --> 34:11.809
Uh-huh.

34:14.679 --> 34:17.714
Do you have any more of that pot?

34:41.040 --> 34:42.623
I don't wanna talk about it.

34:45.427 --> 34:46.560
It's all right, Walt.

34:46.562 --> 34:49.780
That party was pretty intense.

34:49.782 --> 34:53.717
I thought I wanted to be in this world.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.804
But I don't know anymore.

34:56.806 --> 34:59.273
What if I can't handle it?

34:59.275 --> 35:01.008
You can totally handle this world.

35:01.010 --> 35:03.510
You're just a little messed up
right now, that's all.

35:03.512 --> 35:06.196
I can't believe
I'm quoting Nancy Reagan,

35:06.198 --> 35:10.534
but tonight a few of you
just should have said "no."

35:10.536 --> 35:13.287
I'll say.

35:13.289 --> 35:14.571
(Sighs)

35:14.573 --> 35:16.824
Is Larissa okay?

35:16.826 --> 35:17.875
She will be.

35:17.877 --> 35:22.629
But I'm exhausted.
You wanna go home?

35:22.631 --> 35:24.882
Yes. So much.

35:24.884 --> 35:27.551
I'll get us a cab.

35:34.576 --> 35:35.776
It'll wear off.

35:35.778 --> 35:37.828
You know that, right?

35:37.830 --> 35:39.980
You took a pill.

35:39.982 --> 35:43.150
Whatever you're feeling right now,

35:43.152 --> 35:45.018
you're not yourself.

35:47.572 --> 35:49.639

36:01.425 --> 36:03.176
<i>It had been a rough night.</i>

36:03.178 --> 36:05.545
<i>Manhattan had shown me its dark side.</i>

36:05.547 --> 36:07.847
<i>But I'd made it through

36:07.849 --> 36:11.718
<i>and who I wanted to be...
A good friend.</i>

36:11.720 --> 36:13.637
<i>It turns out that while I was gone,</i>

36:13.639 --> 36:16.806
<i>someone else had been
a good friend, too.</i>

36:16.808 --> 36:18.191
Sebastian?

36:20.778 --> 36:22.028
Hey.

36:23.731 --> 36:27.400
I'm really sorry to show up like this.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.336
It's just, mouse is kind of a mess.

36:29.338 --> 36:31.854
Hi! Carrie!

36:31.856 --> 36:34.040
Obviously, I couldn't
take her home to her parents.

36:34.042 --> 36:35.292
What happened to her?

36:35.294 --> 36:38.161
She's... kind of baked.

36:38.163 --> 36:42.031
Do you have any chips?
I really need something crunchy.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.884
Yeah, inside.

36:44.886 --> 36:47.420
Don't worry. I got this.

36:47.422 --> 36:50.974
Um... she's never been stoned
before. Did you know that?

36:50.976 --> 36:52.875
I did not.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.377
Little late to find that out.

36:54.379 --> 36:55.478

36:55.480 --> 36:56.646

36:56.648 --> 36:58.431
Yeah.

37:01.902 --> 37:03.386
Hmm.

37:05.906 --> 37:07.390
It's kind of weird
that I'm here, isn't it?

37:07.392 --> 37:10.226
No.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.394
Okay, yeah.

37:11.396 --> 37:14.230
I debated whether or not to come.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.751
But you had to take care
of mouse, right?

37:17.753 --> 37:19.919
Yeah, it just would have been
wrong to ditch her.

37:19.921 --> 37:22.555
Yeah, I totally get it, and I'm
glad you brought her here.

37:22.557 --> 37:25.008
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.043
I can take care of her now.

37:28.462 --> 37:30.580
Well, uh, I don't wanna be in the way,

37:30.582 --> 37:35.268
so...
I'll just get going.

37:36.771 --> 37:39.439
Hey, Sebastian?

37:39.441 --> 37:41.758
Thanks again.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.944
Yeah.

that I couldn't demonize him</i>

37:48.984 --> 37:50.734
<i>as someone selfish.</i>
