WEBVTT

01:17.995 --> 01:21.331
Are we closed for some
minor national holiday

01:21.415 --> 01:25.043
my "Minor National Holiday" calendar
didn't tell me about?

01:25.127 --> 01:27.504
Nope. Just done for the day.

01:27.587 --> 01:30.007
But it's only 9:30.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.134
Well, I got up at six
and got everything done.

01:33.427 --> 01:37.556
If I'm going to be doing this alone,
I better start practicing.

01:37.639 --> 01:42.602
Turns out, I can accomplish quite a lot
without all the nonsensical chatter.

01:43.729 --> 01:48.191
But I thought we were going to talk
to our lawyer about Omni Tech together.

01:48.275 --> 01:52.654
And I thought we were going to stop
calling my free-spirited ruminations

01:52.738 --> 01:54.615
"nonsensical chatter."

01:54.698 --> 01:55.991
Well, I've already talked to Cheryl

01:56.074 --> 01:59.036
and approved the final draft
of the cease-and-desist letter

01:59.119 --> 02:00.912
that she's sending, so everything's done.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.750
Can we talk, please? Can we?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.252
I'll make you a martini.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.838
This ain't your momma's tea.

02:13.383 --> 02:16.511
Well, I'd at least like to see the letter.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.472
It's done, Frankie. I did it.

02:18.555 --> 02:22.225
I'd like to co-did it. I mean,
I'm the co-doer of things in this company

02:22.309 --> 02:26.438
and it would be nice to be on the other
side of a cease-and-desist for once.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.358
Ooh, that reminds me,
the Magicians' Union called again.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.984
Oh, them.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.444
Here.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.445
Well, thank you.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.406
Let's see. Uh-huh.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.117
Well, first off, the date is wrong,
it's not July.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.078
It is, in fact, July.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.288
Right, right.

02:43.372 --> 02:44.790
I was just testing you.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.918
Unless you were testing me.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.837
No, no, I know it's July.

02:50.921 --> 02:53.382
-Are you gonna read that thing or not?
-I'm reading.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.259
I mean, paragraph three
is a real quagmire.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.970
When does it end
with the "there-tos" and "here-to-fores"

02:59.054 --> 03:02.182
because I'm trapped
in the world's longest run-on sentence.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.266
I know the feeling.

03:03.350 --> 03:06.269
Well, you go off on your own,
you run the risk of getting notes.

03:06.353 --> 03:10.148
Well, I guess going off on my own
feels like the thing to do these days.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.360
Okay, let's unpack
that last remark a little.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.321
Have you unpacked your stuff with Jacob?

03:16.405 --> 03:18.740
Well, no,
I wanted to do it with you first.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.742
I can't help you there, Frankie.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.412
If I tell you to leave,
you're gonna think I don't care.

03:23.495 --> 03:27.207
If I tell you to stay, you're gonna resent
me for keeping you from your boyfriend.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.794
It's a lose-lose. You're gonna
have to talk to somebody else.

03:30.877 --> 03:33.255
But you're the one I want to talk to.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.507
Well, I am going upstairs.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.593
I am disappearing, see?

03:38.677 --> 03:40.595
Oh, just my legs now.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.347
And I'm gone.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.905
Wondering who those jerks are?

03:58.989 --> 04:01.450
Yes, I was. Hello, Steve.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.577
Hey, Robert. Everything okay?

04:03.660 --> 04:07.789
It's just a little understudy humor.
But really, is everything okay?

04:07.873 --> 04:10.500
Yes, Steve, everything is fine.
Who are they?

04:10.584 --> 04:13.086
Oh, some church group from El Cajon.

04:13.170 --> 04:16.131
They always do this.
It's because we're a gay theater group.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.133
They're harmless, just ignore them.

04:18.216 --> 04:22.637
After last night's stumble-through,
they're really the least of our problems.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.391
So kind. Thank you, Steve.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.103
Age before beauty.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.022
Understudy before star.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.326
<i> As you exhale,</i>
<i>bring your head up to your knees</i>

04:44.409 --> 04:46.244
<i>and reach between your legs...</i>

04:46.328 --> 04:48.246
Great happy baby, Mom.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.874
Thanks, it's all in the sphincters.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.919
Yeah, you're really nailing it.
Super troubling.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.253
You got to breathe, Bud.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.381
Oh, is that what my problem is,
that I'm not breathing?

04:58.465 --> 05:01.760
Because I thought my problem
was that yoga is terrible.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.180
Agh. You're right. I hate this.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.308
Bugles, anyone?

05:09.059 --> 05:10.936
Since when do you hate yoga, Mom?

05:11.019 --> 05:13.188
Oh, I don't know.

05:13.271 --> 05:16.525
I guess since I started wondering
if I'd like Santa Fe.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.277
-Are you going to Santa Fe?
-Maybe.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.947
You... will... love it.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.991
There's all these really cool
art galleries on Canyon Road.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.744
And the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.
Don't forget that desert siren.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.039
I stayed in this village
of biohomes there once.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.791
Are you and Jacob planning a trip?

05:33.458 --> 05:34.376
Kind of.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.880
He's thinking maybe
of perhaps moving there.

05:38.964 --> 05:42.592
And he sort of suggested
that I might consider...

05:42.676 --> 05:45.554
coming with him... to live.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.473
-In New Mexico?
-Forever?

05:48.557 --> 05:50.183
What's forever?

05:52.102 --> 05:55.188
-A lot of crime in Santa Fe.
-My biohome smelled like burps.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.065
I think Georgia O'Keeffe hated Jews.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.693
Oh, jeez.

05:59.776 --> 06:03.029
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have told you like this.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.700
Grace won't talk to me,
so I have to talk to somebody.

06:06.783 --> 06:10.412
No, no. It's okay, Mom. We just
didn't know that you two were so serious.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.664
-He's my guy.
-That's great.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.625
I guess we were just hoping
to get to know him a little better,

06:15.709 --> 06:18.503
and that you would get to know Allison
a little better,

06:18.587 --> 06:22.424
and that Allison and Jacob would get
to know each other a little better.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.968
Is there a reason why we should
be getting to know Allison better?

06:25.051 --> 06:25.885
Is there?

06:25.969 --> 06:28.638
Whoa, whoa. Calm down.

06:28.722 --> 06:33.643
I mean, we've sort of talked about
talking about taking the next step.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.603
You have?

06:35.562 --> 06:38.023
Yeah. Yeah.

06:38.106 --> 06:38.940
Ah.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.150
So, good.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.987
You may be taking steps,
I may be taking steps.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.073
-So steps are good, right?
-What about Grace?

06:47.157 --> 06:49.326
I know how much you two
depend on each other.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.328
She must be really upset
by all of this.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.538
Who knows? She won't talk to me.

06:54.289 --> 06:58.043
Her emotions can often come
locked in a hard outer shell.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.919
Kind of like a Tootsie Pop.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.632
You have to lick it down
and then just bite the hell out of it.

07:03.715 --> 07:07.427
Well... I've seen you take down
many a Tootsie Pop.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.473
So, are you going?

07:11.556 --> 07:13.642
I have no freaking idea.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.353
I just know I need to figure it out.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.813
Whatever you decide, we'll be okay.

07:18.897 --> 07:21.066
I mean, I'll ugly cry

07:21.149 --> 07:24.986
and Coyote will write
a series of alt-rock song crimes.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.905
Which I will treasure.

07:26.988 --> 07:30.367
And Santa Fe is just a plane,
train or automobile away.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.370
I can't afford any of those,
but I bet there's a bus.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.330
The bus makes you so sick.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.581
That's me.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.875
Oh, I knew it was one of you.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.009
Yeah.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.803
-Like that?
-Right.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.055
-Are we waiting till they come outside?
-Yeah.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.185
I'm sorry,
I have a real problem with this.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.812
I don't care for your signs.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.982
-Free speech.
-Is a right, not an alibi.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.483
What? You in the "show"?

08:03.566 --> 08:05.694
Unfortunately, no. I wasn't cast.

08:06.611 --> 08:10.115
I'm bringing a surprise lunch
for my husband, who plays John Adams.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.743
Oh, last time I checked
John Adams wasn't a homosexual.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.246
Actually, historians are still debating

08:16.329 --> 08:19.833
the sexuality of a number
of our founding fathers.

08:19.916 --> 08:25.380
Well, I guess you and your other gaywads
can debate that... in hell.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.009
The only people here with tickets to hell
are you and your friends.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.343
You need to step back.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.930
Freedom of speech,
freedom to stand anywhere I want.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.100
-Step back.
-Get your finger out of my chest.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.477
Don't make me say it again, faggot.

08:40.228 --> 08:41.563
What did you just call me?

08:41.646 --> 08:44.482
I think I called you a cocksucking faggot!

08:44.566 --> 08:46.151
Oh, that's just...

08:48.028 --> 08:49.904
Daddy, I'm wet!

08:49.988 --> 08:52.490
- What is wrong with you?
- I... I...

08:52.574 --> 08:53.992
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.368
What is he...?

08:55.910 --> 08:58.079
Why are there children here?

08:59.914 --> 09:01.041
Oh!

09:10.508 --> 09:13.011
Hey. Where are you going all duded up?

09:13.094 --> 09:15.597
I don't know. Shopping.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.600
New lipstick. Extra-popped collar.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.976
I'm guessing a thong.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.563
All right, I'm shopping and then going
straight to Robert's opening night.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.235
You're wearing your power cologne.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.030
It's over, lady. You're toast. Spill it.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.075
All right, I'll tell you where I'm going,
but you are not coming.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.660
And t'where am I allegedly not coming?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.747
-Omni Tech.
-Oh, the letter worked!

09:40.830 --> 09:45.668
Well, our lawyer is sitting down
this afternoon with their lawyers and me.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.504
This is huge, Grace!

09:47.587 --> 09:50.799
Give me five, I'll go put on
a knee-length concert tee.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.802
No need to break out the formal wear.
I've got it covered.

09:53.885 --> 09:57.889
You're about to confront The Man,
which is historically my thing.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.726
Oh, I thought getting your hair caught
in the ice machine was "your thing."

10:01.810 --> 10:04.354
Hey, I lost a lot of hair that day.

10:04.437 --> 10:08.942
And may I remind you again
that I am still half of this company?

10:09.025 --> 10:12.487
And I am going where you're going
whether you want me to or not.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.740
I'm like beach erosion, Grace:
I'm happening.

10:15.824 --> 10:16.825
Oh, God.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.911
All right, but we let the lawyer
do the talking.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.247
You do not talk. I don't talk. Got it?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.207
Fine, but I'm driving.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.917
I'm driving.

10:27.794 --> 10:33.633
That is the second set of my car keys
that disappeared down that sewer grate.

10:33.716 --> 10:36.052
I didn't drop this set, you did.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.680
Yeah, because you screamed,
"He's after you!"

10:38.763 --> 10:40.223
Because I thought I saw a bat.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.726
And had it been a bat,
which I realize now it was not,

10:43.810 --> 10:46.938
it would have been rabid, and you'd be
thanking me for saving your life.

10:47.021 --> 10:50.859
You're the one hanging fruit in the trees
with a sign that says, "For Bats."

10:50.942 --> 10:52.235
They have to eat.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.780
And this is your Panic Alert?

10:55.864 --> 10:59.450
Yes, it is. This car didn't come
with any bells and whistles,

10:59.534 --> 11:01.077
so I use it as an OnStar.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.121
It's because it's basically a golf cart.

11:03.204 --> 11:07.208
And for that rude remark, I'm gonna
make you talk about your feelings.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.753
Nope. You don't talk,
I don't talk, remember?

11:10.837 --> 11:12.630
So, let's practice.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.091
Fine.

11:16.217 --> 11:20.638
<i> Hello, Frankie.</i>
<i>Hope you're feeling extra good today.</i>

11:20.722 --> 11:24.225
I almost got attacked by a bat,
but other than that, I'm good.

11:24.309 --> 11:28.021
<i>you don't have to look outside yourself.</i>

11:28.104 --> 11:31.190
<i>You have everything you need inside.</i>

11:31.274 --> 11:33.318
-I do.
-Are you kidding me?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.445
You said you didn't want to talk.

11:35.528 --> 11:39.490
But I didn't think I'd have to listen
to a conversation between you and you.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.285
Sometimes life sends you
a wonderful surprise.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.872
<i>- Now, just close your eyes...</i>

11:46.497 --> 11:47.832
Get-- No!

11:51.210 --> 11:55.173
<i>-I am healthy, brilliant--</i>
-It was just a tiny veer over the line.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.385
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.764
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather...

12:02.847 --> 12:04.766
-I thought you left.
-Red leather--

12:04.849 --> 12:06.392
Well, clearly, I have not.

12:06.476 --> 12:10.021
And I'm late for our last rehearsal,
which believe me, I need.

12:10.104 --> 12:13.608
-Can I help? What are you looking for?
-My mints.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.486
Abigail Adams has been complaining
about my breath.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.739
While I remain silent,
she drowns me with her spittle.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.157
Ta-da!

12:22.408 --> 12:23.701
Ah!

12:23.785 --> 12:24.911
Thank you.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.497
Now, what else do I need?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.623
What else do I-- Oh!

12:30.541 --> 12:32.752
You're going to have
a great opening night.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.587
There's nothing to be nervous about.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.172
There's plenty to be nervous about.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.509
Peter continues to restage
my opening number,

12:39.592 --> 12:43.012
my feet look like two loaves of bread
baked in those ridiculous shoes.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.682
And, oh, do you remember those protesters
I told you about?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.558
Um... Uh-huh.

12:47.642 --> 12:52.021
Well, apparently some self-righteous idiot
got into a fight with one of them

12:52.105 --> 12:54.065
and threw a beverage at an innocent child.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.444
-I wouldn't call him an idiot.
-I would.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.031
You don't engage people like that.
That's how you give them power.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.242
Now they've tripled in number.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.078
And there was a reporter at the theater
this morning interviewing everybody.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.205
-A reporter?
-Yes, a reporter.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.707
My understudy told me all about it

13:10.790 --> 13:13.459
after he got interviewed
and photographed, of course.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.212
Well, maybe the publicity
will sell tickets.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.965
Sol, this is the kind of publicity
that un-sells tickets.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.509
The owner of the theater
is threatening to close the show

13:21.592 --> 13:22.719
after tonight's performance.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.722
We may very well become
the<i> Moose Murders</i> of La Jolla!

13:25.805 --> 13:30.351
I don't know what<i> Moose Murders</i> is,
but it sounds bad.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.769
It is bad!

13:33.354 --> 13:35.440
Oh, God... Am I bad?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.693
Is that why my understudy
is hanging around all the time?

13:38.776 --> 13:40.820
Maybe the protestors should shut us down.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.947
I never should've done the show
in the first place.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.115
You're spinning out.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.451
I know! I'm a mess! Hold me!

13:51.289 --> 13:54.542
Nobody's going to close the show,
I promise.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.545
And you're going to be great.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.006
-I am?
-Yes.

14:00.089 --> 14:04.177
And if you get nervous,
just look for me out in the audience.

14:04.260 --> 14:08.514
I'll be the boy sitting there
with stars in his eyes.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.267
Okay. That helps.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.565
Thank you, boy with the stars in his eyes.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.443
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.111
Red leather, yellow leather...

14:23.112 --> 14:26.532
My clients have an extensive paper trail
covering the research and development

14:26.616 --> 14:27.909
of the Ménage à Moi,

14:27.992 --> 14:31.287
down to every last email,
fax, letter and package doodle.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.539
Well, our client has an extensive
paper trail, too.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.542
Which I'm betting begins
after the article appeared on Flapper

14:36.626 --> 14:39.754
-about my clients' product.
-What are you looking for, Cheryl?

14:39.837 --> 14:42.465
For starters, you could drop the attitude,
Keith.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.384
And after I consider doing that?

14:44.467 --> 14:47.387
You admit your wrongdoing
so we can all get out of here.

14:47.470 --> 14:48.596
Why don't we do this?

14:48.679 --> 14:51.057
Why don't we go through your letter
point by point--

14:51.140 --> 14:53.559
Tell me what's going on,
so I know what to fake interest in.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.354
That's Nick Skolka. He runs this place.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.981
-Hello, Mr. Skolka.
-Welcome to the Death Star.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.110
Nick Skolka. And you are?

15:02.193 --> 15:03.194
Grace Hanson.

15:03.277 --> 15:07.573
Frankie Bergstein.
So nice to meet you, Mr. Skullcap.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.993
Please, my father was Mr. Skullcap.
Call me Mr. Skolka.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.663
I'm still hearing "Skullcap."

15:13.746 --> 15:16.916
-What are you ladies doing here?
-Suing you for patent infringement.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.252
Oh, get in line. Am I right, Keith?

15:19.335 --> 15:21.712
Actually, sir, we asked you
not to come into these meetings.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.423
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.133
What did I steal from you?

15:25.216 --> 15:26.801
No, not steal. Don't say "steal."

15:26.884 --> 15:28.886
Our vibrator.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.514
Wow.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.600
I have a whole bunch
of follow-up questions.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.352
Our lawyer has all the answers.

15:36.436 --> 15:40.064
-I don't love lawyers. Right, Keith?
-Yes, Dad.

15:40.148 --> 15:43.443
Everyone with a fancy pen and a legal pad
get the fuck out of here.

15:43.526 --> 15:44.694
I do not think that is a good idea.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.905
Keith... you left
the Innocence Project for a reason.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.117
You can go, too, Cheryl.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.786
I do not advise that.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.872
I also do not advise that.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.209
Has anyone ever told you
you have beautiful eyes?

16:02.420 --> 16:03.629
I got this.

16:13.431 --> 16:14.765
Let's go.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.601
But the other guys aren't here yet.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.977
Okay.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.812
Franklin hands it to Livingston,

16:19.896 --> 16:21.564
Livingston hands it to Jefferson,

16:21.647 --> 16:25.485
Jefferson gives it to me, and I do this.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.720
Stop! Stop! Stop!

16:54.347 --> 16:56.974
How did my life lead me here?

16:57.058 --> 16:58.684
Lot of mistakes, that's how.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.562
And where are the rest of the people
in this number?

17:01.646 --> 17:02.647
Good question.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.024
They can't find parking
because of the protestors.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.401
Great. Where are our families
supposed to park?

17:07.485 --> 17:09.570
Can't we do something
about those awful people?

17:09.654 --> 17:11.697
Can I take care of you awful people first?

17:11.781 --> 17:14.659
Does anyone remember
this quill choreography?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.827
-I do!
-Thank God.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.538
Show us, please, Steve.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.249
It's, uh, very simple. You just--

17:34.679 --> 17:36.514
From the top!

17:41.269 --> 17:42.103
Come in!

17:42.937 --> 17:44.272
Hey. Whoa.

17:44.355 --> 17:47.191
This place feels huge now.
It's like the White House.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.068
That's what you wear to an opening?

17:49.151 --> 17:51.237
What? These are beautifully stonewashed.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.156
-With mustard?
-Oh, shit.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.951
I just ate a bunch of mustard.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.955
Pretty crazy about Mom, right?

18:01.038 --> 18:03.207
I really don't want her to move.

18:03.291 --> 18:07.128
Neither do I, but I guess
we're gonna have to get cool with it.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.921
Unless you're thinking...

18:09.005 --> 18:11.799
Reverse<i> Parent Trap?</i>
Using tactics from<i> The Goonies?</i>

18:11.882 --> 18:12.883
It could work.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.760
Oh, it could totally work.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.554
Or I could just go with her.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.514
My tiny house does have wheels.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.268
But you don't have a car so would you just
rickshaw it the whole way there, or...

18:22.351 --> 18:24.770
Shut up. No, it's too far.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.732
I'm almost ready. Sorry.

18:32.445 --> 18:36.699
Did you mean that stuff you said
about you and Allison getting serious?

18:36.782 --> 18:38.868
I mean... yeah.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.330
-So marriage has come up?
-Once or twice.

18:43.831 --> 18:47.585
With her. Like, you marrying Allison.
You marrying her.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.338
-Do you have a problem with that?
-No.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.882
But you got to admit,
she is a little off.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.925
You're a little off.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.720
The last time we went to dinner
she talked to her food.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.848
She was apologizing to her food
because she was about to eat it.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.976
Oh, you mean like a person
that's a little off would.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.687
Oh, my God. You know what,
stop ragging on my girlfriend.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.565
It's really hard to get excited
about a future with someone

19:09.649 --> 19:11.734
when you guys are always shitting on her.

19:11.817 --> 19:15.196
-I'm not shitting on her.
-Yes, you are. You all do.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.781
And I'm sick of it.

19:23.037 --> 19:27.124
Which left us no choice
but to write that letter asking Omni Tech

19:27.208 --> 19:30.419
to cease production
on its Très Belle vibrator.

19:30.503 --> 19:34.090
What a coincidence. You have
a vibrator with a French name, too.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.717
Think you invented
giving French names to sexy things?

19:36.801 --> 19:38.177
Yeah.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.097
Aren't you too big for this?

19:42.056 --> 19:43.641
We're small potatoes.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.436
You're not small potatoes, Nick.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.938
You're huge.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.983
And I got this huge by having my way
with little companies like yours.

19:53.067 --> 19:56.696
Well, how do you think it would look
if the press got a hold of this?

19:56.779 --> 20:01.242
"Omni Tech taking advantage
of a couple of little old ladies."

20:01.325 --> 20:03.327
I don't see a couple of little old ladies.

20:03.411 --> 20:05.538
Well, I do.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.667
Okay, let me see
if I've got this figured out.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.960
You're the kooky one.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.671
And you're the most spectacular woman
I've ever met.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.591
Let me cut to your chase.
You're not crazy about lawyers.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.845
I'm certainly not crazy about lawyers,
I used to be married to one.

20:21.846 --> 20:27.017
Surely... there's some way
that we can work this out on our own.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.561
I have an idea.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.231
How about I make this whole thing
go away over dinner?

20:32.314 --> 20:33.733
Hey, I know I'm hungry.

20:36.861 --> 20:40.406
Oh, no. Stop right there.
Let me set the record straight.

20:40.489 --> 20:45.119
Us sitting on this table
was a power thing, not a sex thing.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.913
-Frankie--
-Yes, you may argue that power and sex

20:47.997 --> 20:52.626
are the same thing, and I might agree
with you under different circumstances.

20:52.710 --> 20:53.627
What's happening?

20:53.711 --> 20:55.546
You just have to let her
tire herself out.

20:55.629 --> 20:59.759
I just ate a whole bunch of nuts
and I can go on for days.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.386
-But you're not going to.
-Oh, yes, I am.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.848
You need to knock it off
and quit cribbing our shit.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.475
Oh, do I?

21:07.558 --> 21:09.310
Let's you and me go talk about this.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.271
Oh, we'll talk about it, all right
when we take you to court.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.732
-Is that what we're gonna do?
-Yes.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.859
Let me sidebar with my partner
for a minute--

21:16.942 --> 21:22.656
No need for a sidebar. You are vile
and your company is disreputable.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.700
Okay. I'll see you in court.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.661
At least I'll get to see you again.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.210
Oh, this is great! I'm pumped.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.212
You're pumped?

21:36.295 --> 21:38.756
Oh, that's good...
'cause we're fucked.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.550
Gays go home!

21:48.182 --> 21:50.309
Oh, where's your Pepsi?

21:50.392 --> 21:53.646
Oh, it was actually
an artisanal soda called "Mr. Bubbly."

21:54.688 --> 21:59.068
I just wanted to apologize
for my behavior the other day

21:59.151 --> 22:04.323
and say I hope we can set our differences
aside and let the good thespians...

22:04.406 --> 22:05.574
Lesbians!

22:05.658 --> 22:09.078
...of the New Lear Community Theater
enjoy their big night.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.873
-What, you gonna throw those at us now?
-No!

22:12.957 --> 22:17.837
As a proud protestor myself, I know
the importance of staying hydrated.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.631
I've fainted many times in the hot sun,

22:20.714 --> 22:25.302
and even though it's almost 6:30,
the sun's rays can still hurt us.

22:25.386 --> 22:31.308
So I present this water
as a peace offering.

22:32.309 --> 22:38.649
I hope we can all learn to live
in a space of mutual respect.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.695
Oh!

22:42.778 --> 22:46.198
That's nice. Great example for your son.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.784
Wasting water during a drought.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.536
Look who's talking about good examples.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.912
Go home.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.789
Gays go home!

22:53.872 --> 22:57.209
Gays go home!

22:57.293 --> 22:58.377
Lovely.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.963
That's just lovely.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.423
Gays go home!

23:07.219 --> 23:10.598
- Forty-five minutes to curtain.
- Paul! Where is Paul?

23:10.681 --> 23:12.725
We need to run the Mr. Adams number again.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.060
I don't know.
He went to Popeye's half an hour ago.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.937
I think he got held up
by those protesters.

23:17.021 --> 23:19.148
Why are you everywhere?

23:21.900 --> 23:24.903
Hate is not a family value!

23:24.987 --> 23:27.698
Neither is throwing soda on a child!

23:27.781 --> 23:29.325
I was trying to throw it at you!

23:30.951 --> 23:33.078
I'll get you. I'm gonna get you!

23:36.665 --> 23:38.459
I don't know why you're mad at me.

23:38.542 --> 23:42.338
I'm mad at you because I had him
exactly where I wanted him.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.549
Where? In 1961 in the Playboy Mansion?

23:45.633 --> 23:49.428
Oh, I know how to handle guys like that.
I've been doing it my whole life.

23:49.511 --> 23:53.474
Just because I was going to dinner with
him doesn't mean it was going any further.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.644
It was one bad day at the office.
We'll fix it.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.772
"We'll"? There's no more "we'll."

23:59.855 --> 24:01.982
-That's not true.
-Oh, yes, it is.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.818
Because half of "we'll" is abandoning me.

24:04.902 --> 24:07.821
And why wouldn't I?
You're acting like I've already left.

24:07.905 --> 24:12.034
You wrote this letter without me,
you were going to this meeting without me.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.994
I don't even know if I'm going yet.

24:14.078 --> 24:15.788
Of course you're going.

24:15.871 --> 24:19.500
Santa Fe is the place you've been
dressing for your entire life.

24:19.583 --> 24:23.295
Don't you understand
that this is an impossible choice?

24:23.379 --> 24:26.715
I don't want to lose Jacob,
I don't want to lose you.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.467
What am I supposed to do?

24:28.550 --> 24:31.470
Oh, I told you.
I can't tell you what to do.

24:31.553 --> 24:32.930
Well, you can say something.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.390
-Like what?
-I don't know,

24:34.473 --> 24:36.308
like, "Don't go, I'll miss you."

24:36.392 --> 24:39.019
Or something a human being
might think or feel.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.689
You think I don't feel anything
about this?

24:41.772 --> 24:44.066
I don't know what you feel,
you won't talk to me.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.734
There's nothing to talk about

24:45.818 --> 24:48.654
until you decide whether you're gonna
run off with your boyfriend.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.532
What would you have done
if things had worked out with Phil?

24:52.366 --> 24:56.453
Would we all be living together at
the beach house, because I don't think so.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.290
Why the hell would you bring up Phil?

25:00.374 --> 25:02.126
I'm just saying I--

25:02.209 --> 25:03.961
Make a hard left on Ferderd.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.504
Let's go!

25:05.587 --> 25:06.964
It's green, Frankie, go!

25:08.757 --> 25:09.717
Frankie, go!

25:10.509 --> 25:13.303
Frankie?

25:13.387 --> 25:14.555
Frankie?

25:16.056 --> 25:17.516
Oh, my God. Frankie!

25:20.519 --> 25:22.438
<i>Ms. Bergstein? Is everything okay?</i>

25:22.521 --> 25:23.856
We need help!

25:25.649 --> 25:26.942
Frankie?

26:13.739 --> 26:15.115
<i>Okay, good night.</i>
