'It is not time itself
that we notice passing,

00:39.840 --> 00:43.910
'but the things it erases
and reclaims for eternity.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.630
'Infancy, childhood,

00:46.680 --> 00:50.150
'golden moments, red-letter days,

00:50.200 --> 00:52.070
'the darkest nights.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.710
'All washed away, as if by water.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.870
'All out of sight, as if by tides.'

00:59.920 --> 01:01.750
It's all right, Beryl.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.280
This will pass. It will pass.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.350
You cannot interrupt the
signal without warning.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.830
The impulses within will
disconnect and become deranged.

01:34.880 --> 01:38.310
Sister, I tasked you with the
flowers in the chapel this morning,

01:38.360 --> 01:42.350
to celebrate the return of our
sisters and our staff from Africa,

01:42.400 --> 01:45.030
but now I find the vases empty.

01:45.080 --> 01:48.870
And you... gyrating in
front of the television.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.230
Sister Ursula, I admit that the vases

01:52.280 --> 01:55.230
await my effort, but I firmly refute

01:55.280 --> 01:57.750
all charges of gyration!

01:57.800 --> 01:59.400
Flowers, dear.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.630
Oh, wait.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.510
Rest assured, Nurse Busby,

02:07.560 --> 02:09.430
if Matron makes a beeline
for this bun today,

02:09.479 --> 02:10.910
it shall not be found wanting.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.870
I could do without
another public reprimand.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.830
We're studying breech births,
and there's a test next week.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.630
Nurse Mount.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.030
- Have you lost your way to the clinical room?
- No, Sister Ursula.

02:21.080 --> 02:23.150
Then might I suggest you join me there...

02:23.200 --> 02:26.480
at your earliest
convenience? Patients await.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.880
Meanwhile, we're all
awaiting her departure.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.070
- Thank you. - Oh, dear.
- Go inside, Barbara.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.700
All right, guv'nor, thank you.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.350
No sooner looked but they loved,

03:02.400 --> 03:04.870
no sooner loved but they sighed,

03:04.920 --> 03:07.590
and in these degrees have they made

03:07.640 --> 03:11.070
a pair of stairs to marriage.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.830
- Dare we ask to see the ring, Babs?
- I don't have one, yet.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.230
Tom proposed to me in a field in Africa,

03:17.280 --> 03:20.950
so I've got a blade of
grass in a Germolene tin.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.510
Simply charming.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.760
I do hope no ointment was
wasted in the process.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.030
We husbanded our resources
very carefully, Sister Ursula,

03:31.080 --> 03:33.510
and left Hope Clinic
in a much better state

03:33.560 --> 03:35.310
than it was when we arrived.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.110
We even left Nurse Franklin
behind -- on loan --

03:38.160 --> 03:41.560
- for the next two months.
- So I've been informed.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.910
Now, I imagine luncheon will be welcome.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.960
It certainly would.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.470
Oh.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.750
Has something gone wrong in the kitchen?

04:04.800 --> 04:06.150
Not at all.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.550
I simply thought that with
the return of our adventurers,

04:08.600 --> 04:10.710
we might embrace a new routine.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.510
A frugal luncheon, packed if required,

04:13.560 --> 04:16.149
with our hot meal served at
the end of the working day,

04:16.200 --> 04:17.510
not in the midst of it.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.790
But it's clinic this
afternoon, Sister Ursula,

04:19.839 --> 04:23.200
and a hearty meal at one
o'clock helps keep us all going.

04:24.360 --> 04:27.070
Sister Winifred, could you
fill the water jug, please?

04:27.120 --> 04:29.150
Of course.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.600
- Would you like a dash of
lemon barley in it? - No.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.950
Don't sit down just yet, ladies.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.710
The Mother House will be
telephoning in a few moments,

04:41.760 --> 04:45.070
and I'm sure Sister Julienne
would like to take the call.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.230
Of course.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.230
Nonnatus House. Sister Julienne speaking.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.750
Greetings.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.230
Sister Julienne!

05:07.280 --> 05:08.820
Oh, my dear.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.550
You look so very well. And happy.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.030
Yes. Oh, I've just delivered
a beautiful little boy,

05:17.080 --> 05:19.220
and you've all come home!

05:23.360 --> 05:26.670
I've just been speaking
to Mother Jesu Emmanuel,

05:26.720 --> 05:29.190
and she thanks everyone who's
just returned from South Africa

05:29.240 --> 05:31.230
for their service to the order,

05:31.280 --> 05:34.220
and of course to the
people that we helped.

05:37.320 --> 05:41.160
She also wished me to tell you
an important piece of news.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.950
Sister Ursula, who has worked
so tirelessly in our absence,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.470
will not be returning to the Mother House.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.950
As of today, she will officially...

05:53.000 --> 05:55.470
be in charge of all matters

05:55.520 --> 05:58.520
medical and spiritual
here in Nonnatus House.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.830
And I will be serving...

06:03.880 --> 06:06.550
as a member of staff, underneath her.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.230
I would like to be the first to...

06:14.280 --> 06:15.950
offer my good wishes

06:16.000 --> 06:18.240
to our new superior.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.870
Pink for maternity, blue for postnatal.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.030
A ticket for each patient to be
seen in strictly numerical order.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.350
I'm sorry, Sister Ursula,

06:50.400 --> 06:53.870
but the traditional half-hourly
timings have worked well enough.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.350
But is well enough good
enough, Mrs Turner?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.670
Before the order's Cottage
Hospital was closed,

06:58.720 --> 07:01.470
there were accusations of inefficiency.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.190
I shouldn't like the clinic here
to be subjected to complaints.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.470
Oh, most mothers don't
mind when things run on.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.710
They can attend talks and
catch up with their friends

07:09.760 --> 07:11.870
over tea and biscuits.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.670
In future, Mrs Turner, biscuits
will be for fainters only.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.910
Eating for two should be
about careful nutrition,

07:18.960 --> 07:20.830
not self-indulgence.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.670
Oh, what's all this?
Are we having a raffle?

07:28.720 --> 07:32.150
No, but we're taking a
gamble, if you ask me.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.070
Sister Julienne, whatever are you
doing? That's very heavy work.

07:44.120 --> 07:48.390
Sister Ursula charged me with
setting out the furniture.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.560
It is a necessary task,
and one I do gladly.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.080
Pink ticket number 21.

08:21.120 --> 08:25.230
I think that will be you,
Mrs Watts. Thank you.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.390
I'll have a feel of
your tummy in a minute.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.790
Before I do that, do you want
to tell me why Master Mickey's

08:30.840 --> 08:32.390
not in school today?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.549
He's having trouble with his waterworks.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.230
During the day, or just at night?

08:36.280 --> 08:38.270
At night, mainly, but...

08:38.320 --> 08:39.909
when he has an accident, he cries.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.950
He won't go to school in the morning.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.870
I think the other kids torment him.

08:43.919 --> 08:46.390
He doesn't smell of wee, or
anything. I'd never let that happen.

08:46.440 --> 08:50.390
- No. - He gets called names
because of those glasses.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.710
We've been waiting and waiting
to hear back from the hospital.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.310
It can't be much fun peering
out at the world from behind

08:56.360 --> 08:58.950
that pirate's eye patch, young man.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.710
How about, I'll ring that eye department

09:01.760 --> 09:03.430
and chivvy them along?

09:03.480 --> 09:05.360
Yes, please.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.710
I could nip to the telephone now.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.110
They might even squeeze
you in this afternoon.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.470
Oh, I can't do anything else today.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.830
I've been sat here for hours
waiting for my number to come up,

09:15.880 --> 09:18.590
and I've got obligations.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.950
We'll salvage that mascara.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.630
And when we've listened
to baby's heartbeat,

09:23.680 --> 09:25.630
pop off and attend to your business,

09:25.680 --> 09:28.240
and I'll telephone St Cuthbert's.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.790
All right, mate?! How you doing?

09:40.840 --> 09:43.520
- You're looking great!
- Lester.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.190
Trudy!

09:51.400 --> 09:54.430
Blimey, Trude, good job they
let me out for good behaviour.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.630
- You? Good behaviour?
- Get any bigger, I'll be needing longer arms.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.070
Daddy's won a cup for his boxing.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.440
Go on, Mickey, take it.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.030
Take it.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.280
There you go. You can
start your own collection.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.030
Got a pair of gloves waiting
for him down the gym.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.270
No, Lester. Not the ring, not for Mickey.

10:19.320 --> 10:20.630
What's with his glasses?

10:20.680 --> 10:23.430
- Is it that squint?
- The proper word's an astigmatism.

10:23.480 --> 10:26.080
Oi, Lester. Come on.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.910
I had to give the organisers a
list of people who'd contribute.

11:24.960 --> 11:28.790
And you did quite enjoy the lessons you
had before you went to South Africa.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.990
Do turn that transistor down, Deels.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.950

11:33.000 --> 11:35.510
I'm soldiering on in

11:35.560 --> 11:38.070
The set's still in South
Africa, and no telly.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.070
This is our only chance of entertainment.

Apart from our cocktail of the day...

11:43.280 --> 11:44.870
which is the Grasshopper.

Equal parts creme de menthe, creme

My pottery teacher said

Yet.

Besides, that blade of grass is
more precious to me than diamonds.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.990
I'm Barbara Gilbert, midwife
and curate's fiancee,

- Not many girls would say that.

14:42.680 --> 14:45.110
Well, you're not engaged to many girls.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.040
No. Just you.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.790
- See you later.
- Bye!

14:53.840 --> 14:55.710
See you at the gym.

15:05.080 --> 15:08.350
Come on, then. Your mother's
conked out on the couch.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.590
It's two o'clock in the morning.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.510
I've had a long day.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.190
I've had a long eight months.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.590
You never did that in my dreams.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.840
You never did that in mine.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.830
Ow!

15:35.880 --> 15:37.950
I'm going down the dock road.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.830
There's girls down there who'll give
it to me better than you ever did

15:40.880 --> 15:42.990
for a ten bob note.

15:43.040 --> 15:47.630
Some of them will do it for a
gin and orange, or a snakebite.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.960
Ah!

16:09.200 --> 16:11.390
It's all right, Mickey.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.910
I promise.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.830
Ah, good morning.

16:24.880 --> 16:30.190
May I point out that it is eight
o'clock and 30 seconds precisely?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.790
And I do not enjoy commencing my day

16:32.840 --> 16:36.160
with an impersonation
of the speaking clock.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.750
Sister Winifred -- maternity home.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.230
I shall take over from
you for the night shift.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.950
Nurse Gilbert -- all the bookings in,

16:44.000 --> 16:47.080
plus an extra task in
support of Mrs Trudy Watts.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.790
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting, Nurse Crane.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.950
Sister Ursula stopped me in the corridor.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.630
There's absolutely no need
to apologise, Sister Julienne.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.870
I've put you down as first on call today.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.750
I think we'll be hearing from Mrs Gupte,

17:01.800 --> 17:04.599
and she'll need someone very experienced.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.310
No, I'm afraid Dr Turner's
been called to an emergency.

17:16.359 --> 17:18.630
No, I can't prescribe.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.550
Because I'm only 15.

17:23.359 --> 17:26.069
- Where's your mother?
- She suddenly felt really ill.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.829
She asked me to sit here for a minute,

17:27.880 --> 17:30.470
because she couldn't leave the
medical records unattended.

17:30.520 --> 17:34.440
Leave this to me, and run for your
bus. Don't forget to comb your hair.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.230
Good morning. Midwife calling.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.030
I hope you've got some
Alka-Seltzer in that bag of yours.

17:52.080 --> 17:55.110
Or a box of Omo, cos that
bloody kid's wet the bed again.

17:55.160 --> 17:58.790
- Has Mickey gone to school?
- Yes. Thank Christ.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.270
Snivelled all the way, mind you.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.670
Could you tell Mrs Watts
that Nurse Crane has asked me

18:02.720 --> 18:05.430
to collect him this afternoon,
and take him to the eye clinic?

18:05.480 --> 18:08.030
She thought it might help
her if she could rest.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.120
All right. Well, I can't
take him. I'm off to Margate.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.470
I weren't joking about that Alka-Seltzer.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.860
We don't carry it, I'm afraid.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.790
Knock-knock. All patients dispatched.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.150
Doctor plied with tea and
provided with clean instruments,

18:28.200 --> 18:29.870
and sent off on his rounds.

18:29.920 --> 18:33.910
- Thank you, Sister.
- You still struggling with Cape Town tummy?

18:33.960 --> 18:36.910
Only shook mine off about a week ago.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.360
Is it... both ends?

18:40.640 --> 18:43.590
It's kind of you to ask, but I'm
sure no-one needs chapter and verse

18:43.640 --> 18:46.380
on my every visit to the smallest room.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.950
Violet, would you be averse
to me paying you a compliment?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.430
So long as it doesn't interfere
with my press stud inventory.

19:00.480 --> 19:04.600
You have got a lovely silhouette.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.110
Don't you start talking to
me in French, Fred Buckle.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.700
You don't know where it might end.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.710
Good afternoon, Nurse
Gilbert. What can I do for you?

19:16.760 --> 19:19.760
Do you stock plastic
pants, aged five to six?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.990
Could you attend to that light
bulb for me, please, Frederick?

19:25.040 --> 19:27.310
Strictly speaking, they're
an incontinence garment,

19:27.360 --> 19:31.790
not baby linen, but I can telephone
one of my wholesalers for you.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.270
Meanwhile, I was hoping that you'd

19:33.320 --> 19:36.350
have something for me to admire by now.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.750
Oh, no, not yet.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.390
That piece of grass will
be dead by Commonwealth Day,

19:40.440 --> 19:42.510
and you'll want to have
something to show off by then,

19:42.560 --> 19:45.990
as I gather that you're going to be
performing on your potter's wheel.

19:46.040 --> 19:49.630
Oh! They'll be needing bobbies on
horseback to control the crowds.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.470
I'm actually quite nervous about it.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.470
The wheel is quite difficult to control,

19:53.520 --> 19:56.640
and the only other time I've used
it, things became quite violent.

20:27.950 --> 20:28.950
If you're nervous,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.710
why don't you come and give a
demonstration to my Brownies?

20:31.760 --> 20:33.710
Practice makes perfect.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.840
Oh, yes, good afternoon. Is
that Renton's Hygienic Garments?

20:44.840 --> 20:47.510
We can sit down and enjoy our holiday.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.990
Sorry, Miss Dawkins. I was
calling to collect Mickey Watts.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.470
He has an eye clinic appointment.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.150
He left ten minutes ago with his father.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.340
Oh! Oh, that's fine, then.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.510
Who do you reckon loves you most, Mickey?

21:04.560 --> 21:07.790
Most out of everyone you ever knew or met.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.310
Mum.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.500
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

21:12.440 --> 21:15.310
And who do you reckon loves you next most?

21:20.600 --> 21:23.280
Me. I do. Your dad.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.430
And Granny Zelda loves you.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.240
The world's full of people who love
you, cos you ain't even six yet.

21:32.160 --> 21:36.070
But you're going to be seven
next year, then eight, then nine,

21:36.120 --> 21:39.390
all the way up to numbers you
ain't even done in school yet.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.030
And you're going to get called names.

21:42.080 --> 21:44.670
And you're going to get thumped.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.350
And you'll have to fight your corner.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.430
You'll have to fight for every
bastard thing you've got,

21:51.480 --> 21:55.280
cos the only person who's ever
really going to love you...

21:55.680 --> 21:57.150
.. is you.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.880
And that's why I'm going to
show you what to do with these.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.380
Midwife calling.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.150
I've had a breakthrough
on the bed-wetting front.

22:15.200 --> 22:18.230
But you took Mickey to the
hospital about his eyes.

22:18.280 --> 22:21.560
- Anyway, where is he?
- Didn't his father bring him home?

22:24.640 --> 22:26.580
The gloves have gone.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.030
This is how you learn to be a man, Mickey.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.820
This is how you stop 'em calling names.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.740
Mickey!

22:53.920 --> 22:56.430
I'm sorry, Mrs Watts, but Mickey's
father had the right to remove

22:56.480 --> 22:59.270
him from school premises, as long
as he had permission from the staff.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.590
But he never had permission
to take him to the gym.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.110
Lester's not a fit father. He's
only just come out of prison.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.350
Neither Nurse Crane nor
I knew that, Trudy.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.510
I'm not sure it would have made
any difference if you had. He was

23:10.560 --> 23:13.390
convicted of demanding money with
menaces, not cruelty to a child.

23:13.440 --> 23:15.070
So he's free to do what he likes, then?

23:15.120 --> 23:17.720
Thank you. You made that very clear.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.070
We were only trying to help.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.320
I'll drop round the gym
and have a friendly word.

23:28.840 --> 23:32.190
Sister, aren't you coming downstairs
to join us for handicrafts?

23:32.240 --> 23:35.040
I can't. I'm preparing for my life vows.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.830
Community recreation is just as important.

23:39.840 --> 23:43.740
Sister Ursula says I need to
spend more time on my studies.

23:57.080 --> 24:00.110
The difficulty with television
is that it kills the conversation

24:00.160 --> 24:02.300
in the room so completely.

24:04.440 --> 24:08.390
Without that cumbersome
device to distract us,

24:08.440 --> 24:11.640
we can take greater
pleasure in our handicrafts.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.790
And in one another's company.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.510
Sister Ursula, are we allowed to know

24:17.560 --> 24:18.950
where the television set has gone?

24:19.000 --> 24:22.080
Suffice to say, it is now in a
place where it will be enjoyed.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.510
I had the police call round the gym.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.590
Acting all matey. The police!

24:31.640 --> 24:33.910
Making sure there was nothing
they need to investigate,

24:33.960 --> 24:36.230
when there wasn't a mark
on the little bastard!

24:36.280 --> 24:39.870
You're good at that, aren't you?
Not leaving marks on people, Lester.

24:39.920 --> 24:44.390
I never know whether it's cos you're
clever, or cos you're just a coward.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.780
Coward?

24:48.560 --> 24:49.900
Coward?

24:53.160 --> 24:56.790
Cowards don't do this, do they?

24:58.680 --> 25:00.510
Or this.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.900
Or this!

25:06.720 --> 25:09.630
Lester...

25:09.680 --> 25:12.270
- What about Mickey?
- He'll be all right.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.820
He ain't got the brains to
get himself in any bother.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.990
Your dad's playing a game, Mickey.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.190
It's like a pirate game.

25:42.240 --> 25:46.320
We're pretending he's gone away to
sea, and he's put me in a prison.

25:49.960 --> 25:53.390
Listen, I want you to
go and get some toys,

25:53.440 --> 25:55.710
and sit and play on the stairs.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.840
- You can pretend you're guarding me.
- All right, Mummy.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.350
The most important thing,
when you begin to throw a pot,

26:12.400 --> 26:16.790
is to make sure that your clay is in
the absolute centre of your wheel,

26:16.840 --> 26:20.030
so you need to throw it down firmly.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.950
Ooh!

26:22.000 --> 26:23.230
Stop laughing at once!

26:23.280 --> 26:26.550
How can poor Nurse Gilbert
make a lovely vase if she can't

26:26.600 --> 26:29.590
concentrate because of all the noise?

26:29.640 --> 26:35.310
Then you need to smooth it --
oh, dear -- into a cone shape.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.470
Oh, erm...

26:37.520 --> 26:38.990
Erm, right.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.710
Oh, er...

26:41.760 --> 26:48.110
Erm, and the next step
is to make an opening...

26:48.160 --> 26:50.900
Oh. Oh. Oh.

27:06.360 --> 27:11.390
Mickey, it's getting too dark for
this part of the pirate game.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.630
I need you to go and
fetch something for me.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.420
All right, Mummy.

27:17.440 --> 27:23.070
I have noticed a certain halting
of progress since I assumed the

27:23.120 --> 27:28.470
role of your spiritual directress,
but the prospect of life vows can be

27:28.520 --> 27:33.030
a difficult time for a novice, and
you are assured of all our prayers.

27:33.080 --> 27:35.310
I don't always doubt them.

27:35.360 --> 27:39.150
There are times when I feel
them upholding me like wings.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.340
And times when you do not?

28:03.320 --> 28:07.000
Push it under the door, lovey.
Here, push it towards me.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.360
That's it. That's it, Mickey.

28:26.560 --> 28:28.670
I don't want to ply you
with questions, child,

28:28.720 --> 28:33.670
but if I do not ask them, I
fear we shall not find answers.

28:33.720 --> 28:36.830
Do you think I don't ask questions myself?

28:36.880 --> 28:39.110
Questions come into my head all the time.

28:39.160 --> 28:42.070
Sometimes I think He is asking them of me.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.920
Sometimes I think I'm asking them of Him.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.640
The voices are more
similar than you'd think.

29:25.360 --> 29:28.030
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

29:28.840 --> 29:32.140
- I promise you.
- Mummy, when are you coming out?

29:41.800 --> 29:43.160
Mummy!

30:04.600 --> 30:07.950
Mickey... Mickey, run
and... bang on the door.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.840
Bang on it. Run.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.120
Help! Help!

30:17.120 --> 30:19.800
[Help me! Help my mummy!]

30:29.440 --> 30:30.880
Hurry!

30:32.200 --> 30:33.480
Help!

30:37.680 --> 30:39.670
Oh, my dear.

30:39.720 --> 30:40.860
Oh.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.100
Come inside.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.660
Come inside, where we can help you.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.070
- What is this disturbance?
- Mrs Watts is in labour.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.310
Things are moving rather fast.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.910
In that case, she should be at the
hospital or the maternity home.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.070
She was unable to make her way to either.

31:00.120 --> 31:03.350
We will assess the situation
here and see what we should do.

31:07.400 --> 31:09.670
Clinical room, straight away.

31:20.840 --> 31:23.920
You've looked after your
mother very well, young man.

31:25.120 --> 31:28.320
Now, I think it's time
someone looked after you.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.750
Would you like to come with me?

31:30.800 --> 31:33.670
We'll see if we can find the biscuit tin.

31:33.720 --> 31:36.760
Might find some chocolate
ones, if we're very lucky.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.790
That's it. That's it.

31:44.840 --> 31:47.580
- Won't be long now. Trust us.
- I do.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.000
Oh!

32:06.360 --> 32:08.830
Oh, I can see baby's head, Trudy.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.040
One last push.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.750
There.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.110
You have a daughter, Trudy.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.900
Mucus extractor.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.420
What's happening?

32:25.840 --> 32:28.240
We need to clear baby's airways.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.880
Love you, little girl.
Love you, do you hear me?

33:18.600 --> 33:22.120
- Will we have to go to hospital?
- It would be best in the circumstances.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.790
I don't care. I'm not going.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.840
I'm not leaving Mickey.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.350
Bit of a rude arrival for
the poor little soul.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.150
Bathing in her own first bowel movement.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.590
- But will she be all right?
- There's no harm done.

33:48.640 --> 33:51.750
And Mickey is watching
television with my own lad.

33:51.800 --> 33:56.070
And wearing a slightly-too-small
pair of my daughter's pyjamas.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.870
But a boy can't have everything.

33:57.920 --> 34:00.230
We're going to set up a camp bed for him,

34:00.280 --> 34:02.350
so he won't be far away.

34:05.680 --> 34:08.880
We can talk about everything
else in the morning.

34:13.719 --> 34:17.429
I used to go down the old rectory
gardens when I was a kid.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.590
Do my dreaming.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.070
You can hear the church
bells ringing down there.

34:22.120 --> 34:25.480
No wonder I used to dream about
weddings and white dresses.

34:29.159 --> 34:32.510
But love never really
got me anywhere at all.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.760
Love brought you here
tonight, though, didn't it?

34:36.520 --> 34:39.389
Love is why you refused to go to hospital.

34:40.480 --> 34:43.070
So you could keep your
little family together.

34:43.120 --> 34:45.659
But love won't keep us safe, Nurse.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.639
I need to start hating now.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.510
Oh, lass, such strong words.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.560
But I've got to be
strong now. Don't you see?

34:56.239 --> 34:58.640
Why don't you wait till morning?

35:06.600 --> 35:09.470
You contradicted my authority last night.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.310
Junior members of staff heard of it.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.310
And so did Sister Mary Cynthia,
who is approaching the end of her

35:15.360 --> 35:18.790
novitiate, and requires a clear
example of our rule of life.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.230
No, Sister.

35:20.280 --> 35:23.830
Sister Mary Cynthia requires
encouragement, gentleness,

35:23.880 --> 35:27.230
and understanding. Last autumn,
she was violently attacked.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.910
She gave them the necessary
evidence, and since that date,

35:29.960 --> 35:32.510
she's never spoken a word of it.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.470
But what if she needs to speak of it?

35:34.520 --> 35:38.910
Sister Mary Cynthia takes her
strength from our continued prayers,

35:38.960 --> 35:42.790
and you can uphold her further
by setting an example, Sister.

35:42.840 --> 35:47.040
Obedience in all things, including
the will of the Almighty.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.320
Lester, get out.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.190
Got in easily enough.

36:18.240 --> 36:21.440
- You've got no right to be here.
- Yes, I have.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.070
I'm checking out what's mine.

36:38.400 --> 36:42.390
- Trudy, this isn't sensible.
- He'll be at the gym for three hours.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.230
If I go home, I'll be safe.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.910
I'll be somewhere where
doors can be locked, by me.

36:46.960 --> 36:49.270
Do you at least have
money for your taxi fare?

36:49.320 --> 36:52.110
I'm asking the cabbie to
stop at Ziegler's Jewellers.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.950
These got me into this mess
-- they can get me out of it.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.110
Taxi fare, new locks,
solicitor. In that order.

36:59.160 --> 37:01.160
I'm getting a divorce.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.280
- Wait for me!
- Wait!

37:10.800 --> 37:12.950
I'm actually struggling to
understand the connection

37:13.000 --> 37:16.350
between the Commonwealth
and balloons, Barbara.

37:16.400 --> 37:20.030
Well, they're made of rubber,
which comes from India, Malaysia,

37:20.080 --> 37:22.880
- and Ceylon.
- And what about pottery?

37:23.680 --> 37:26.710
Everywhere in the former
empire use plates.

37:26.760 --> 37:29.470
I've just realised this will
be our first parish event

37:29.520 --> 37:31.670
as an engaged couple.

37:31.720 --> 37:35.080
Well, I should give my Germolene
tin an extra polish, then.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.280
- Oh, it doesn't matter, Tom.
- It matters to me.

37:47.040 --> 37:49.710
Trudy, baby was only born last night.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.230
Dr Turner's on his way,

37:52.280 --> 37:55.720
but we'd all feel better if you
had the usual twice-daily visits.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.720
And I think you would, too.

38:01.160 --> 38:04.310
I'm a good mother, Sister.
You have to trust me.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.030
I do trust you.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.840
Just like you trusted us last night.

38:10.840 --> 38:14.750
- They want to help you, Trudy.
- I'm going to have to do this on my own.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.870
My mum kept putting all
her chips on men --

38:16.920 --> 38:18.630
marrying them, not marrying them.

38:18.680 --> 38:22.110
Always ended up with a black
eye, and the same old mess.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.670
I broke out that bedroom on my own.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.350
And now I'm going to break away from him.

38:27.400 --> 38:30.280
I want you to succeed, Trudy. I really do.

38:32.040 --> 38:35.600
- But... - No. No, don't you
cry. Please don't you cry.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.510
I'm happy about this, Sister.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.350
I'm doing something I should
have done a long time ago.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.110
Trudy, so few people have
the courage to do that.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.430
Trudy!

38:46.560 --> 38:48.790
This is my house! Open this door!

38:48.840 --> 38:51.430
It is my house too, because I
am your wife, and you are not

38:51.480 --> 38:54.710
coming over this threshold because
my children aren't safe if you do.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.600
You can't keep me out!

39:08.120 --> 39:09.790
What's happened?

39:09.840 --> 39:12.310
I've been fighting for my rights.

39:15.920 --> 39:19.400
I'll have the law on you!
Changing my bloody locks!

39:30.600 --> 39:33.800
What's happened, Sister?
Got yourself a puncture?

39:42.960 --> 39:46.560
Sister, I know your door isn't locked...

39:47.560 --> 39:50.100
.. but I will not force my way in.

39:58.560 --> 40:01.030
And I've taken your name off the roster,

40:01.080 --> 40:03.020
so that you can rest.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.190
You can't do that!

40:06.240 --> 40:08.550
You aren't in charge!

40:08.600 --> 40:11.470
Even Sister Ursula isn't really in charge.

40:17.040 --> 40:21.440
My head is so full of scriptures
that the phrases fray...

40:23.000 --> 40:25.270
.. and jumble on occasion....

40:26.680 --> 40:30.750
.. but I would still lay
every slipple at your feet,

40:30.800 --> 40:34.040
if I thought these fragments
might illuminate your way.

40:36.080 --> 40:39.000
Will you take refuge in medicine instead?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.750
It will hydrate as a sedative.

40:45.800 --> 40:48.550
I can't take it, I've got
so many things to do!

40:48.600 --> 40:52.720
You have given this to women in
their labours countless times.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.710
Ugh!

41:00.760 --> 41:05.190
- You can't take my bag away!
I might need it! - Sister...

41:05.240 --> 41:06.760
Oh, Sister.

41:07.960 --> 41:10.600
What was it Julian of Norwich wrote?

41:12.920 --> 41:14.670
Not the thing about, "All shall be well."

41:14.720 --> 41:17.350
Not that, because I can't
believe that any more.

41:17.400 --> 41:23.670
She wrote, "God did not say
thou shalt not be tempested,

41:23.720 --> 41:28.560
"thou shalt not be travailed,
thou shalt not be diseased."

41:30.600 --> 41:34.280
"But he said, thou shall not be overcome."

41:43.040 --> 41:45.310
Sister Mary Cynthia has
never received treatment

41:45.360 --> 41:47.310
for mental instability.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.790
And the most recent record
we have for her relates to

41:49.840 --> 41:51.710
her injuries after the attack.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.750
I blame myself for this.

41:53.800 --> 41:58.270
I wanted her to survive. I wanted
her pain to vanish with her bruises.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.270
She knew that.

42:00.320 --> 42:03.320
And she lives and
breathes to please others.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.390
I want Dr Turner to see her.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.710
He will want to see her, too.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.400
I'm sorry, it's just...

42:15.880 --> 42:18.020
.. the smell of the milk.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.440
Breakfasts have been impossible.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.390
Breakfasts?

42:24.440 --> 42:27.240
I can't quite believe it myself, Sister.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.310
Even Patrick doesn't know.

42:30.360 --> 42:31.680
But...

42:33.560 --> 42:35.630
.. I'm expecting a baby.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.200
- And I'm so afraid.
- Oh!

42:41.160 --> 42:42.700
And I'm not.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.040
Because I never stopped praying.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.590
But we were told we could
never have children.

42:51.640 --> 42:54.600
Shelagh, there's no doubt at all now.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.420
You can ask him to share your joy.

42:59.160 --> 43:02.120
I don't know how I'm going to tell him.

43:31.720 --> 43:33.070
I blame the films.

43:33.120 --> 43:38.150
Makes girls go mad for romance and
roses and Rossano Bloody Brazzi.

43:38.200 --> 43:41.630
And when they don't get it, you'd
think the sky had fallen in.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.910
I thought that way meself once.

43:43.960 --> 43:45.270
Or twice.

43:45.320 --> 43:48.590
Maybe even three times, but my
son-in-law owns this house outright,

43:48.640 --> 43:50.910
and he's got prospects, and
he respects his elders.

43:50.960 --> 43:53.830
There's plenty worse off than my daughter.

43:53.880 --> 43:57.310
Er, Mr Watts is not willing
to allow Mrs Watts to remain

43:57.360 --> 43:59.790
in the property if the
marriage is dissolved.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.190
I'm not paying you to
know what my husband wants.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.270
I want to know what I can do.

44:03.320 --> 44:05.030
I thought you were
supposed to be a midwife.

44:05.080 --> 44:06.910
Can't you stop that kid from whingeing?

44:06.960 --> 44:10.270
I find babies are unsubtle when
there's tension in the room.

44:10.320 --> 44:11.710
So take her in the kitchen.

44:11.760 --> 44:14.910
Or when they're removed any
distance from the mother.

44:16.800 --> 44:19.670
Er, you can divorce your
husband for cruelty, Mrs Watts,

44:19.720 --> 44:22.750
providing you can prove
that cruelty took place.

44:22.800 --> 44:26.110
He locked me in the bedroom. I could
have died giving birth on my own.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.830
Well, were there witnesses, Mrs Watts?

44:27.880 --> 44:30.230
There was witnesses when he put
his fist through that window.

44:30.280 --> 44:34.030
- Would they testify to it?
- Course they won't bloody testify.

44:34.080 --> 44:36.230
People round here have to get
on with their neighbours,

44:36.280 --> 44:38.750
and like I said, Lester's got connections.

44:38.800 --> 44:41.590
And I've got burns -- here, here and here.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.030
He did them with his cigarette.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.910
Again, you would have to
PROVE that, Mrs Watts.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.030
I'm extremely happy to give
a statement summarising

44:48.080 --> 44:49.270
the medical overview.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.630
Why should you have to? You can see them.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.670
Just like you can see the
bruises under my hair where

44:53.720 --> 44:55.990
he digs his fingers in when
he don't get what he wants.

44:56.040 --> 44:58.390
And how do we know you didn't
do all these things to yourself,

44:58.440 --> 45:00.750
when you didn't get what YOU wanted?

45:00.800 --> 45:03.800
She's got form in that
department, Mr Wylton.

45:05.520 --> 45:08.460
That was years ago,
when Mickey was a baby.

45:09.400 --> 45:10.750
And I put my own head in the oven.

45:10.800 --> 45:13.600
I never tried to pretend that was Lester.

45:15.920 --> 45:19.710
It occurs to me, Mrs Watts, that
you may wish to apply for custody

45:19.760 --> 45:21.270
of your children, in which case...

45:21.320 --> 45:23.350
Custody? But they're my kids.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.870
Why should I apply for anything?

45:24.920 --> 45:28.030
Because they are your
husband's children, too.

45:28.080 --> 45:32.630
You could be construed as having
a history of mental instability,

45:32.680 --> 45:34.990
and he has certain rights.

45:35.040 --> 45:37.030
What about Mrs Watts' rights?

45:37.080 --> 45:40.560
And her children's -- don't they
have a right not to be terrorised?

45:52.080 --> 45:54.030
You look tired, Sister.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.150
I slept for a long time.

45:58.200 --> 46:00.710
How did you feel when you fell asleep?

46:00.760 --> 46:02.470
As though...

46:02.520 --> 46:04.880
my mind was flat, and black.

46:06.320 --> 46:09.040
Like a blackboard covered in writing.

46:10.800 --> 46:14.440
- And when you woke up?
- As though it had been rubbed clean a little.

46:16.080 --> 46:17.470
I have to keep my head still,

46:17.520 --> 46:21.030
or else I can still see the words
out of the corners of my eyes.

46:21.080 --> 46:23.420
Can you tell me what they say?

46:24.400 --> 46:28.920
Say? The words -- they don't talk.

46:35.840 --> 46:38.110
Do you think I might be ill?

46:40.360 --> 46:41.560
I do.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.630
But that means you can be healed.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.070
- Excuse me, please.
- Oh, sorry.

47:02.560 --> 47:06.670
I can't and I won't barge in
without your say-so, but please,

47:06.720 --> 47:09.190
let me take a look at you, Trudy.

47:12.960 --> 47:17.990
Just had a delivery. Legal
papers, from Lester's solicitor.

47:18.040 --> 47:20.310
He's going for custody
with immediate effect.

47:20.360 --> 47:23.870
I would prefer to discuss the
situation with Mrs Watts.

47:23.920 --> 47:26.320
Trudy, let me see if I can help.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.540
You'll make things worse.

47:30.360 --> 47:32.700
I've got to do this on my own.

47:33.160 --> 47:35.160
Because I'm on my own.

47:35.640 --> 47:38.310
So, if you'll excuse me, my
son-in-law has asked me to supervise

47:38.360 --> 47:41.960
the locksmith, and this time,
madam here ain't getting any keys.

48:07.160 --> 48:10.230
It's not right. It's just not.

48:10.280 --> 48:12.950
The man Trudy's trying
to escape is a criminal,

48:13.000 --> 48:16.080
and he's playing the legal
system like a penny violin.

48:17.120 --> 48:19.590
I'm generally wary of elaborate drinks,

48:19.640 --> 48:22.630
but a small, dry sherry
won't hit the spot tonight.

48:22.680 --> 48:24.830
So, what's our poison, then, Phyllis?

48:24.880 --> 48:26.790
Brandy Alexanders made with

48:26.840 --> 48:29.840
condensed milk for a
velvety, luxurious taste.

48:31.000 --> 48:34.240
This Women's Realm pamphlet's
been quite an education.

48:35.520 --> 48:39.470
- Brandy Alexander, Patsy?
- No, thank you.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.830
An evening of ulcer-dressing
and haemorrhoid compression

48:41.880 --> 48:45.710
on the district rounds
rather spoilt my appetite.

48:45.760 --> 48:48.760
And if you wouldn't mind
getting off my bed...

48:49.920 --> 48:52.190
.. I'd quite like a lie-down.

49:21.280 --> 49:25.110
Doctor, if I wasn't aware of
Sister Mary Cynthia's need for

49:25.160 --> 49:29.840
psychiatric help before I saw you
with her yesterday, I am now.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.990
And I'm very grateful for your interest.

49:33.040 --> 49:36.830
There is a particularly gentle,
and therefore suitable,

49:36.880 --> 49:40.710
therapeutic community near
Birmingham, called Northfield.

49:40.760 --> 49:43.910
Because her family live there,
we may be able to get her in.

49:43.960 --> 49:47.430
Doctor, the Order of St Raymond
Nonnatus is sister Mary Cynthia's

49:47.480 --> 49:51.950
family now, and she's already
left for the Mother House.

49:52.000 --> 49:55.440
She'll be seen by a Chichester
doctor as soon as she arrives.

49:59.880 --> 50:02.350
- Dr Turner.
- Sister...

50:02.400 --> 50:05.150
did you see Sister Mary
Cynthia before she left?

50:05.200 --> 50:06.790
No, I did not.

50:06.840 --> 50:07.910
She wasn't at the wards,

50:07.960 --> 50:11.430
and when I went to her room
before breakfast, it was empty.

50:11.480 --> 50:15.960
- I see. - I cannot question what has
happened, but I do want it noted.

50:25.080 --> 50:27.790
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

50:27.840 --> 50:30.920
Er, we've had an unscheduled
delivery at the station.

50:40.280 --> 50:42.310
There was a bottle in the bag she left.

50:42.360 --> 50:45.990
The teat came off, and it leaked all
over the nappies and the clothes.

50:46.040 --> 50:48.310
How can a mother abandon her children?

50:48.360 --> 50:49.750
And she obviously cares so much.

50:49.800 --> 50:53.310
I think you'll find Trudy did
this BECAUSE she cares so much.

50:53.360 --> 50:56.110
Be that as it may, we have
to find out where she's gone.

50:56.160 --> 50:59.160
Abandonment is a criminal
offence. You can get six months.

51:03.640 --> 51:08.030
Trudy Watts is not the criminal in
this situation, Sergeant Noakes.

51:08.080 --> 51:10.270
No. I can see that.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.350
I was about to telephone
the children's officer,

51:12.400 --> 51:14.540
to organise a foster home.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.110
But if we put these children into care,

51:17.160 --> 51:19.510
we may have trouble getting them out.

51:19.560 --> 51:21.430
Trudy's already on her knees.

51:21.480 --> 51:24.990
I've no interest in kicking her,
or her kiddies, while she's down.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.910
And I think I might know where she's gone.

51:37.560 --> 51:41.310
I've lost track of the times
you've crept into my room now.

51:41.360 --> 51:44.910
I never tire of looking for
the look upon your face.

51:44.960 --> 51:47.960
Is it going to be excited
Pats, or happy Pats?

51:49.280 --> 51:52.350
Sad Pats or troubled Pats?

51:52.400 --> 51:54.910
But I love all of those girls.

51:54.960 --> 51:56.710
Even this one.

51:56.760 --> 51:58.230
What, apologetic Pats?

51:58.280 --> 52:00.430
Apologetic Pats and I do
have what you might call

52:00.480 --> 52:02.350
a glancing acquaintance.

52:02.400 --> 52:04.340
I owe you an apology.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.070
For being brusque and not telling you why.

52:11.920 --> 52:15.200
And for something else which may
never happen, but if it does...

52:17.000 --> 52:19.670
.. it's going to hurt us both so much.

52:22.440 --> 52:24.510
What?

52:24.560 --> 52:26.390
I've had a letter from Hong Kong.

52:26.440 --> 52:29.110
- From your father?
- From his nurse.

52:30.400 --> 52:34.560
He's developed a degenerative
condition of the nervous system.

52:35.640 --> 52:37.780
Do you need to visit him?

52:38.920 --> 52:41.190
I spoke to his nurse. He's...

52:41.520 --> 52:43.120
.. paralysed.

52:43.800 --> 52:46.200
He wants me to go to him, but...

52:47.400 --> 52:49.600
.. I don't know what to do.

52:58.040 --> 53:00.910
I reckon this is one for you, Nurse Crane.

53:20.480 --> 53:23.280
Well, lass, you've given us all a fright.

53:24.640 --> 53:28.740
But I don't think anyone involved's
been more afraid than you.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.430
I thought I was going to kill myself.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.350
But you didn't.

53:52.520 --> 53:55.910
And I'm not going to ask you
why, because you're a mother.

53:55.960 --> 53:58.960
Therefore, the answer's
quite obvious to me.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.590
I thought there was no other way.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.670
No other way to get away from Lester.

54:04.720 --> 54:08.720
- No other way to save the kids.
- There's always another way...

54:11.160 --> 54:14.160
.. if you've someone
to help you look for it.

54:26.200 --> 54:27.790
Hello.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.310
Hello, you.

54:33.920 --> 54:37.310
- A ring.
- An engagement ring.

54:37.360 --> 54:40.680
I bought it for both
of us, from my savings.

54:42.920 --> 54:45.910
That's not the way it's
meant to be, Barbara.

54:45.960 --> 54:48.000
No. It's a new way.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.340
Our way.

54:56.520 --> 54:58.520
And absolutely perfect.

55:17.680 --> 55:20.230
'In the spring of 1962,

55:20.280 --> 55:24.590
'no-one knew what the tides
would bring to Nonnatus House.

55:24.640 --> 55:28.710
'The currents ebbed and eddied,
leaving no clear channel for its

55:28.760 --> 55:34.440
'ship to sail upon, but even in the
midst of such uncertainty came joy.'

55:42.440 --> 55:44.910
Are you going to watch me do my drawing?

55:44.960 --> 55:47.760
It's going to be a very special picture.

55:49.200 --> 55:52.310
'No-one is ever as alone as they imagine.

55:52.360 --> 55:55.470
'Trudy Watts spent some
time in a hostel for women,

55:55.520 --> 56:00.670
'and the help she received changed
both her prospects and her fate.

56:00.720 --> 56:04.950
'She was awarded custody of
Mickey, and his baby sister,

56:05.000 --> 56:08.030
'and rehoused in a council
flat far from London,

56:08.080 --> 56:12.990
'where there were green fields and
skies that held a hint of blue.'

56:13.040 --> 56:14.380
Patrick.

56:16.080 --> 56:19.160
You gave me a note once,
from you and someone else.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.790
Now I'm giving you this...

56:24.840 --> 56:27.760
from me, and someone else.

56:33.120 --> 56:35.390
"Please will you be my dad?"

56:39.640 --> 56:45.350
'For everything washed away,
a fresh potential dawned,

56:45.400 --> 56:49.750
'and in every wave of change,
there came a new beginning.'

56:49.800 --> 56:53.150
- Bye!
- Bye! Thank you!

56:53.200 --> 56:54.400
Bye!

57:07.000 --> 57:08.390
It's normally a wonderful thing,

57:08.440 --> 57:10.110
a mother brimming over with excitement.

57:10.160 --> 57:11.470
In this case, it unsettles me.

57:11.520 --> 57:14.670
I'm scared if you go in to that
hospital, you won't come out.

57:14.720 --> 57:18.470
You are midwives and nurses,
not maids and nannies.

57:18.520 --> 57:21.920
Those who do not earn their
place must find another.

57:24.120 --> 57:26.630
Telephone for an ambulance
and the fire brigade!

57:26.680 --> 57:29.440
Valerie Dyer. I'm a nurse.
Tell me what you need.
