00:04.190 --> 00:04.840
No

00:04.860 --> 00:05.900
I will always love you,Melinda.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.630
Not you.

00:07.700 --> 00:08.730
You have to cross over.

00:08.800 --> 00:09.630
I don't want to.

00:09.930 --> 00:10.790
The day of the accident,

00:10.790 --> 00:13.090
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body

00:15.160 --> 00:16.160
You're back.

00:16.530 --> 00:17.860
Do I know you?

00:17.860 --> 00:19.560
I see the same guy that you see...

00:19.590 --> 00:21.190
It's not Jim. I just know what I see

00:21.260 --> 00:22.930
when I look in those eyes.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.690
And Jim is in there somewhere.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.260
Heh. Wait. You're not gonna tell me

00:26.330 --> 00:27.590
you think I'm your husband reincarnated.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.700
You're the only one who can see me.

00:28.760 --> 00:29.930
Please,help.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.470
Was something there?

00:31.500 --> 00:34.000
Sorry again for being so distracted.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.000
Where is she always running off to?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.100
Will you tell me what is going on between us?

00:38.300 --> 00:39.500
Look,I know what it's about.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.300
What?

00:40.300 --> 00:42.430
That you're not ready to start dating yet,and it

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

01:09.470 --> 01:10.160
Get up, Now!

01:10.700 --> 01:11.380
Get out of here!

01:12.070 --> 01:13.640
Now! Now! Now! Come on! Move on!

01:14.830 --> 01:15.880
- Let's go!  - Where are we going?

01:16.150 --> 01:17.480
Hey! Grab the shoes, they're gonna need 'em.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.900
- What is going on?  - Shut up! Let's move!

01:19.030 --> 01:20.320
- Come on!  - Where are you taking us?

01:22.240 --> 01:23.170
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

01:28.400 --> 01:28.990
Come on!

01:30.710 --> 01:32.240
Go on! Go on!

01:33.660 --> 01:34.390
Get it there!

01:36.390 --> 01:37.790
Ok. Let's go!

01:40.240 --> 01:40.890
Where are we going?

01:41.510 --> 01:42.780
What you... what you gonna do with that?

01:42.780 --> 01:43.370
Shut up!

01:43.770 --> 01:44.290
Move it!

01:45.630 --> 01:46.240
Where are you taking us?

01:47.600 --> 01:48.740
Come on! Keep moving!

01:56.170 --> 01:57.780
Line them up!

01:57.780 --> 01:58.740
Come on! Let's go!

02:03.440 --> 02:05.020
Each, stay!

02:13.490 --> 02:14.750
You may leave now, brothers.

02:22.660 --> 02:24.830
Tonight, your lives will change forever.

02:25.300 --> 02:28.120
If you waver or show any sign of weakness,

02:28.310 --> 02:29.660
you won't survive.

02:30.860 --> 02:34.490
The bags over your heads make you nameless and faceless in our eys.

02:35.190 --> 02:38.320
Only those of you who prove your worth will become sisters.

02:38.320 --> 02:39.540
Until then,

02:41.570 --> 02:42.470
you are nothing.

02:43.220 --> 02:43.900
Scissors.

02:54.350 --> 02:55.850
Now that we've restored your sight,

02:56.490 --> 02:58.880
your mission is to each retrieve one token,

02:59.380 --> 03:01.940
A symbol from the Sigma Theta Chi crest.

03:03.620 --> 03:07.780
The serpent , the golden dagger, the orb, and the raven.

03:09.380 --> 03:11.070
You'll be given seperate instructions.

03:11.820 --> 03:13.280
Once you found your token,

03:13.470 --> 03:17.080
you must follow the map's directions to your assigned locations.

03:17.080 --> 03:20.370
Here's a map with directions. Don't lose it.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.270
If you disobey by joining forces

03:22.270 --> 03:24.100
or seek to lessen your burden

03:24.170 --> 03:25.870
By removing your head covering,

03:25.940 --> 03:28.270
You will be eliminated. We're watching you.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.840
These woods have eyes.

03:29.900 --> 03:33.240
And know that if you ever breathe a word of this to anyone,

03:33.300 --> 03:36.500
You will forever be banned from the sisterhood.

03:36.570 --> 03:38.970
You have until the sun rises in 4 hours.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.540
If you come upon a noose,

03:40.600 --> 03:43.900
Know it's the place where others have failed or fallen.

03:43.970 --> 03:46.370
Don't touch it. Look away.

03:46.440 --> 03:49.940
And run the opposite direction. And pray no one follows.

03:54.070 --> 03:56.400
Not you,Courtney.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.635
Why don't you just drop out now and save us all the time?

03:59.935 --> 04:01.200
Come over here.

04:01.270 --> 04:05.440
Tie your shoes. Gather your wits. Time is ticking.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.100
What are you waiting for?

04:07.200 --> 04:08.670
Show us you're worthy,

04:08.670 --> 04:10.140
-  or you're out.  - Let's go.Go

04:10.200 --> 04:12.020
Failure is not tolerated.

04:12.020 --> 04:14.340
Get moving,now!

04:21.839 --> 04:23.570
Did you plant the nooses?

04:23.640 --> 04:26.900
They're everywhere.

04:35.370 --> 04:37.640
Oh,god,where am I?

04:41.340 --> 04:44.400
Hello? Who's there? Is anybody there?

05:14.400 --> 05:17.800
Ok. I don't need to hear the gory details...

05:17.870 --> 05:19.870
Just yet.

05:19.940 --> 05:22.440
It's good. Ok? We're having a great time.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.170
And we had breakfast together again this morning.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.540
Because last night you...

05:26.600 --> 05:28.800
We're here doing inventory.

05:28.870 --> 05:29.800
With Sam?

05:29.870 --> 05:30.940
No,alone.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.640
What?

05:32.700 --> 05:35.470
You've done inventory the 3 times. Ok? it was my turn.

05:35.540 --> 05:38.670
Ok. Let's just be clear here. Sam first.

05:38.740 --> 05:39.870
Ghosts second.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.640
And the store...You know, we'll figure that out.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.535
Well,thank you. But I have responsibilities

05:44.535 --> 05:46.370
to you and to them.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.900
Ghosts do not take sick days just because I'm dating.

05:50.740 --> 05:51.870
Morning.

05:51.940 --> 05:55.070
Hey. I thought I'd bring you guys a little jolt.

05:55.140 --> 05:56.570
That's nice of you.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.300
Yeah. That's perfect.

05:59.370 --> 06:01.200
Here,Delia.

06:01.270 --> 06:02.770
Thanks.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.640
I'm gonna go over here.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.740
Hey,look. I've gotta go and do a bid for a contractor tonight,

06:11.800 --> 06:14.340
But I was wondering what your afternoon's looking like.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.670
I'll cover for ya.

06:16.740 --> 06:18.340
Well that's nice of you.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.400
I know it's totally out of the blue,

06:19.470 --> 06:20.700
But I was thinking,you know,

06:20.770 --> 06:22.670
You're not really a planning ahead kinda person,right?

06:22.740 --> 06:24.240
I know,I'm sorry.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.640
No,you're busy. I get it.

06:25.700 --> 06:28.640
But,I got this invite to this art opening.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.100
And are you into art?

06:30.170 --> 06:31.240
Sure.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.540
I think I used to be,too.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.240
I'm on the email list of this artist.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.470
And apparently I even bought something from him.

06:36.540 --> 06:38.370
They say he's the next Rodney Sable.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.900
I don't know who that is.

06:39.970 --> 06:42.500
That's really good. Because I don't know either.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.540
I don't know. Some up-and-coming artist,right?

06:44.600 --> 06:46.370
Um,what do you think?

06:46.440 --> 06:47.400
Yes.

06:47.470 --> 06:49.140
- I mean,she can cover. - I'll cover...

06:49.200 --> 06:50.640
- For her. - For me.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.670
Good.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.600
I'll take that as a yes.

06:55.670 --> 06:56.740
But if you need to cancel.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.170
No,I won't.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.400
Um,starts at 2:00.

07:06.470 --> 07:07.740
Perfect.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.870
See you at 2:00.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.940
What? I said "yes."

07:19.000 --> 07:21.470
And what do you say if you see a ghost?

07:21.540 --> 07:22.940
No,thank you.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.140
Exactly.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.070
Oh,if only it were that easy.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.970
Hey,did you sign my copy?

07:30.040 --> 07:31.470
Hot off the press.

07:31.540 --> 07:32.570
Let me see! Let me see!

07:32.640 --> 07:34.640
You know,you're lucky you rushed over here.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.140
The bookstore sold out already.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.800
All to my mom.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.855
Intimacy and Commitment:

07:39.855 --> 07:41.840
Making the bond,  breaking the fear

07:41.900 --> 07:44.840
Eli James, PhD." This is so cool.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.170
You know that Jim and I were your inspiration.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.670
Yeah,I wrote the entire book based on you two.

07:49.740 --> 07:51.670
No,the three of you. Are we counting Sam?

07:51.740 --> 07:53.640
Which,by the way, since you brought it up...

07:53.700 --> 07:55.240
You may want to read a couple of chapters.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.170
Learn a few things about prioritizing your relationship.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.340
Did Delia call you?

07:58.400 --> 07:59.040
Yes.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.570
Did she call it a relationship?

08:00.640 --> 08:03.170
Yes. Which under any other circumstances I would call fast.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.600
Not you. You're slow. Making the poor guy wait.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.100
Oh no.

08:10.170 --> 08:11.800
What?

08:11.870 --> 08:14.000
That poor ghost, and I have a date.

08:14.070 --> 08:16.240
And I promised Delia no ghost stuff.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.400
Ok. Some of us aren't blessed with ghost vision.

08:18.470 --> 08:19.640
Can you make it talk?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.440
That might be a hard. She has a bag over her head.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.670
What else?

08:22.740 --> 08:25.270
Uh...A black slip and sneakers. Nothing else.

08:25.340 --> 08:26.940
Good times.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.400
Look. Why don't you go talk to her and see what happens?

08:28.470 --> 08:30.840
Me?! I don't even know where she is. You go!

08:34.640 --> 08:35.804
You looking for someone?

08:35.804 --> 08:36.970
You want to tell me what happened?

08:37.640 --> 08:39.400
Ask my sister.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.400
So,I'm guessing since she was in front of sigma theta chi,

09:27.460 --> 09:29.930
"ask my sister" meant sorority sister.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.830
Yeah. But what about the bag over her head?

09:31.900 --> 09:33.700
Do you think she was kidnapped, tortured,what?

09:33.760 --> 09:35.660
Probably both. It's called hazing.

09:35.730 --> 09:37.660
Oh,yeah. It is that time of year isn't it.

09:37.730 --> 09:39.330
Yep. Pledge week.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.330
More aptly titled,  lord of the flies season...

09:42.400 --> 09:44.200
When sweet-seeming co-eds like these

09:44.260 --> 09:47.130
Torture,abuse,and mold the mind of eager young freshmen.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.000
Wait. You weren't...

09:49.060 --> 09:52.430
In a sorority? No. All right,I was way too shy.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.460
But I thought that colleges banned hazing.

09:54.530 --> 09:55.860
Technically they did.

09:55.930 --> 09:58.330
But my buddy is the faculty greek advisor.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.930
And he says it still goes on.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.215
Much more on the hush-hush since the

10:01.215 --> 10:02.430
trustees are on the lookout for it.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.760
So,you think she was being hazed when she died?

10:04.830 --> 10:06.530
Well,the bag-over-head tells me yes.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.100
But if a student recently died or even went missing,

10:09.160 --> 10:10.860
Everybody would be talking about it.

10:10.930 --> 10:13.000
Unless it was really recent and she just died.

10:13.060 --> 10:15.000
And the house didn't even know about it yet.

10:15.195 --> 10:16.447
The ghost sure seemed pretty sure that

10:16.447 --> 10:17.700
the sorority sister knew about it.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.660
And she did keep looking at that one girl.

10:19.730 --> 10:21.030
I could go find that one girl.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.530
See if she's in that sorority.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.660
What?

10:24.730 --> 10:27.060
Nothing. Nothing.

10:27.130 --> 10:30.360
I've just never quite seen you so eager to go follow the lead.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.100
Oh,come on. Don't even go there.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.700
Ok. I'm a faculty member.

10:33.760 --> 10:36.400
Technically. Legally, I can't even think those thoughts.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.430
Half-naked co-eds in jeopardy thoughts?

10:38.500 --> 10:40.230
All right. You know what? leave me alone.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.160
Fine,I'm gonna go meet up with Sam.

10:42.230 --> 10:44.060
And you're gonna follow the girl...

10:44.130 --> 10:45.360
- I'm all over that blonde.  - Right.

10:45.430 --> 10:46.460
Metaphorically speaking.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.230
I'm mortified. I used to into that kinda thing?

10:53.300 --> 10:55.930
Yeah...It was interesting.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.060
Yeah. If by interesting, you mean completely ridiculous,then sure.

10:59.130 --> 11:00.500
Come on.

11:00.500 --> 11:04.360
You don't find a lime jell-o tower work of art?

11:04.430 --> 11:06.460
Maybe at a Vegas buffet.

11:10.530 --> 11:14.130
You can't imagine how much I want to kiss you right now.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.200
Do I have to imagine?

11:17.260 --> 11:20.230
No. But you know...

11:20.300 --> 11:22.160
Don't move.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.600
Lately I've been really into moments,you know?

11:26.660 --> 11:28.100
Not letting them go by.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.730
I mean,after losing my whole life.

11:33.630 --> 11:35.560
Is that crazy?

11:35.630 --> 11:38.860
Not at all.

11:45.530 --> 11:48.030
I'm almost done.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.160
Take your time.

12:01.330 --> 12:05.060
Hi! Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second?

12:05.130 --> 12:06.260
You're Makenna,right?

12:06.330 --> 12:09.400
You're the president of sigma theta chi,right?

12:09.460 --> 12:11.030
I'm Eli James.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.600
I'm a professor in the psychology department here.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.160
Can I help you?

12:14.230 --> 12:18.360
The thing is,I got a text from one of girls that I treat.

12:18.430 --> 12:20.360
And I think she's pledging your sorority,

12:20.430 --> 12:22.000
And may be in trouble.

12:22.060 --> 12:23.300
Was it from Courtney?

12:23.360 --> 12:28.130
I can't say. Doctor/patient confidentiality.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.360
But what happened with Courtney?

12:29.430 --> 12:30.730
I don't know.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.530
I just got a call from one of the sisters.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.130
Our pledges were out in the woods last night,

12:35.200 --> 12:36.860
Courtney hasn't come back.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.630
How long's she been gone?

12:38.700 --> 12:40.460
Everyone spilt up around 2:00 this morning.

12:40.530 --> 12:42.460
She should've been back 5 hours ago.

12:42.530 --> 12:44.300
That's a long time to be out in the cold.

12:44.360 --> 12:47.900
I know, and it dropped below freezing.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.160
We didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.

12:50.230 --> 12:51.560
Don't let me hold you up.

12:51.630 --> 12:53.230
We should go find her.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.160
Yeah.

13:03.730 --> 13:05.000
I'm so sorry,mom.

13:05.060 --> 13:06.660
I should never have let her go out there.

13:06.730 --> 13:08.200
This is all my fault.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.160
I have to go.

13:10.230 --> 13:12.800
Don't worry. Everyone's out there looking for her.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.200
I'll call you as soon as I hear anything.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.460
Hey, Em...I'm really sorry.

13:19.530 --> 13:20.700
I don't know what happened.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.600
I gave Courtney her directions,

13:22.660 --> 13:24.130
But maybe they didn't make sense.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.960
Emily,I'm professor James.

13:26.030 --> 13:27.560
I'm a therapist over at Rockland U.,

13:27.630 --> 13:28.860
If there's anything you need to talk...

13:28.930 --> 13:32.600
Thanks. Really, I just need to find my sister.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.000
This is really bad.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.260
We've never had a pledge who did not come back.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.860
Wait. So Emily and the missing girl are actual sisters?

13:40.930 --> 13:44.830
Emily's a junior. Courtney's a freshman.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.900
You have no idea how cruel they are.

13:49.960 --> 13:53.200
Courtney? Is that you?

13:53.260 --> 13:56.860
I want to help. Please. For the sake of your sister.

13:56.930 --> 13:58.400
Let me tell her what happened to you.

13:58.460 --> 14:01.130
She already knows.

14:04.330 --> 14:06.000
So,the ghost is Emily's real sister.

14:06.260 --> 14:08.060
And we think that Emily knows she's dead?

14:08.130 --> 14:09.700
Emily was a wreck.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.900
It could have been guilt,

14:10.900 --> 14:12.900
But to me she seemed genuinely concerned.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.730
Like hoping her sister would be ok.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.050
Yeah. Or hoping that she didn't get caught

14:16.050 --> 14:17.300
for whatever they did to her.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.860
I mean,choosing your "sisters" over your own blood,

14:19.930 --> 14:21.160
Does anyone really do that?

14:21.230 --> 14:22.500
She may not have a choice.

14:22.560 --> 14:25.160
I mean,sometimes these sororities can be brutal.

14:25.230 --> 14:27.000
They choose sisterhood over all.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.900
You make it sound like it's a cult.

14:30.030 --> 14:31.400
You're away from home for the first time.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.660
They offer you protection, family,comfort.

14:33.730 --> 14:35.280
You have to do these crazy rituals

14:35.280 --> 14:36.830
and say these weird oaths to get in.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.200
Call it whatever you want.

14:38.260 --> 14:40.430
Ok. So,if it's a cover-up, then they can close ranks.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.630
And soon.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.930
Which means I should talk to the pledges asap.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.930
So,you're with the psych department.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.760
They sent you to talk to us about last night?

14:48.830 --> 14:51.930
That's perfect. Because we totally need our heads examined.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.260
It was a complete nightmare.

14:54.330 --> 14:58.160
Courtney's missing. Elise took a fall and had to get stitches.

14:58.230 --> 15:01.330
So,what exactly happened?

15:03.960 --> 15:07.560
Look,I know you guys were pledging Sigma Theta last night.

15:07.630 --> 15:09.400
And I know you took an oath of silence.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.460
Like we'd be protecting them?

15:11.530 --> 15:13.630
We didn't even want to join that crazy place.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.230
Courtney talked us into it.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.230
She can talk anyone into anything.

15:17.300 --> 15:20.360
Even wearing a burlap sack over your head?

15:20.430 --> 15:22.730
Someone narked about that?

15:22.800 --> 15:24.160
Those things were nasty.

15:24.230 --> 15:27.030
It's supposed to symbolize equality within the sisterhood.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.460
With bags on we all look the same.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.500
We're all equally humiliated is what she means.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.400
Wearing black nighties to bed every night.

15:34.460 --> 15:36.580
Keeping tennies by our bed so that

15:36.580 --> 15:38.860
we're ready whenever they decide to come for us.

15:38.930 --> 15:41.430
It's all meant to keep you on edge.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.630
So,what happened up in the woods?

15:43.700 --> 15:47.430
Well,we were all given a specific part of the sorority crest to find.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.760
They call it a token.

15:49.830 --> 15:52.530
They said if we didn't find ours there'd be consequences.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.730
We split up to search.

15:55.730 --> 15:57.530
We never saw Courtney after that.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.940
Do you think that's what happened to Courtney?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.270
She suffered the consequences.

16:01.700 --> 16:04.200
Honestly,they never said what our punishment would be.

16:04.260 --> 16:05.360
But those girls are severe.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.860
This is like life and death to them.

16:06.930 --> 16:08.700
If Courtney couldn't find her token,

16:08.760 --> 16:12.560
I could see them doing something to hurt her, not on purpose...

16:12.630 --> 16:13.960
But her own sister was up there.

16:14.030 --> 16:17.230
So? She didn't want Courtney to make it anyways.

16:17.300 --> 16:18.560
Really?

16:18.630 --> 16:20.760
All I know is that every sorority wanted Courtney.

16:20.830 --> 16:22.930
She was smart,sweet,popular.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.430
Emily was...not.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.730
She was totally harsh to Courtney last night.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.300
Grabbed her before we left.

16:29.360 --> 16:31.060
We couldn't hear what they were saying,

16:31.060 --> 16:32.760
but it looked pretty intense.

16:32.830 --> 16:34.430
First thing I thought when Courtney didn't come back

16:34.500 --> 16:36.400
was that Emily had sabotaged her.

16:36.460 --> 16:39.030
Either that or the noose got her.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.730
Come on. Don't tell me you actually bought into that whole story.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.030
What story?

16:44.100 --> 16:46.360
It's nothing. Just part of their psych out routine.

16:46.430 --> 16:47.560
It's all made up.

16:47.630 --> 16:50.300
But the weirdness between Emily and Courtney...

16:50.360 --> 16:52.300
that was real.

17:00.760 --> 17:01.830
Oh,hey. Let me get that for you.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.359
Thank you. Sorry.

17:04.430 --> 17:06.530
Thanks. Here.

17:06.599 --> 17:07.700
All right.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.230
It's freezing in here.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.460
Yeah. I know.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.530
The thermostat's been stuck at 58 for 2 days.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.660
Why didn't you tell me?

17:14.730 --> 17:16.530
I don't know. I just...

17:16.599 --> 17:18.660
I felt bad about asking you to do things around here,

17:18.730 --> 17:20.030
you know,since we're...

17:20.099 --> 17:23.630
Since...We're dating.

17:24.930 --> 17:27.900
Wow. It's weird to talk about this.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.230
I feel like I'm in high school.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.860
Was high school this awkward?

17:30.930 --> 17:32.630
'cause I'm glad I don't remember.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.230
No kidding.

17:37.130 --> 17:38.800
Nice.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.660
Look. Wait a minute.

17:41.730 --> 17:44.930
If we're dating, shouldn't I help you with things like this?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.230
I mean, that's what boyfriends do.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.930
Yeah. I guess so.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.780
I mean,if your thermostat's broken,you know.

17:51.780 --> 17:55.560
If your fire needs feeding...

17:55.630 --> 17:59.460
I mean,you know, heat related problems...

18:03.530 --> 18:05.160
I'm your man...

18:08.100 --> 18:10.160
You're a little warm.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.800
That's me.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.560
That's me.

18:19.630 --> 18:20.560
Gone.

18:20.630 --> 18:23.300
I was...I was warm.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.760
- Yeah? - Right.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.100
You were...

18:30.760 --> 18:31.700
Hi. I don't know if I have the right number,

18:31.760 --> 18:33.160
but I'm looking for Sam.

18:33.230 --> 18:35.130
He's not answering his cell.

18:35.130 --> 18:37.030
Uh,this is Ed,his supervisor.

18:37.100 --> 18:39.360
Look. I gave out your number as a reference for work.

18:39.430 --> 18:40.930
Nice.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.560
A Rockland student's gone missing up at Red mountain.

18:42.630 --> 18:45.300
And it's supposed to drop into the 30th tonight.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.860
we're putting together a search party at the firehouse if you can make it.

18:47.930 --> 18:49.100
Wow. That's bad.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.230
Yeah.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.030
To be alone in these woods on a night like this.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.160
Poor thing.

18:53.230 --> 18:56.560
Um,I hate to do this, but I should go.

18:56.630 --> 18:59.230
Right. Right.  I'll meet up with you.

18:59.300 --> 19:01.930
And I'll see if can get Delia and Eli to come, too.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.530
I can't imagine how long she can last up there.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.800
Not very long,I don't think.

19:05.860 --> 19:07.560
I'll call you.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.760
Hey,Emily. Eli James.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.700
Right. I remember. You helping with the search?

19:33.760 --> 19:36.600
Yeah. I was hoping I could talk to you about something.

19:36.660 --> 19:39.030
Uh,yeah. Sure.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.600
How did you feel about Courtney pledging your sorority?

19:43.660 --> 19:45.360
I was fine with it. Why?

19:45.430 --> 19:47.360
I spoke with a few pledges who said they saw you

19:47.430 --> 19:48.930
getting into a fight with her in the woods.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.460
It wasn't a fight.

19:50.530 --> 19:51.860
She's lying!

19:57.830 --> 19:59.260
What happened with you two?

19:59.330 --> 20:00.800
We just had a disagreement.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.160
How could she do this?

20:02.230 --> 20:03.600
So,you didn't do anything?

20:03.660 --> 20:06.630
Maybe try to get her off track somehow?

20:06.700 --> 20:09.460
My sister is out there, possibly freezing to death,

20:09.530 --> 20:11.700
And you're accusing me of trying to sabotage her?!

20:11.760 --> 20:14.000
I'm not saying you meant for things to go this far.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.300
But things may have gotten out of hand.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.800
You're wrong.

20:16.860 --> 20:18.260
I was dirty pledging.

20:18.330 --> 20:19.560
What?

20:19.630 --> 20:21.260
I was trying to help Courtney.

20:21.330 --> 20:23.330
That's why I pulled her aside in the woods.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.730
Not you,Courtney.

20:24.800 --> 20:28.800
Why don't you just drop out now and save us all the time?

20:28.860 --> 20:31.960
- Come over here. - Tie your shoes. Gather your wits...

20:32.030 --> 20:33.130
Give me your directions.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.760
No,I need them to find my token.

20:34.830 --> 20:35.800
When's the last time you ate?

20:35.860 --> 20:37.030
I'm fine.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.660
I told you to stash a powerbar in your sneakers.

20:38.730 --> 20:41.830
You need to take care of yourself.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.760
Take my directions.

20:43.830 --> 20:44.465
Their maps is no good.

20:44.465 --> 20:46.900
You'll be walking around in circles all night.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.800
I don't need any special help. I can do this on my own.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.730
Just take my map.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.360
Fine.

20:54.430 --> 20:55.860
Courtney has low blood sugar.

20:55.930 --> 20:57.200
It's usually not a big deal

20:57.260 --> 20:59.130
except when you're grabbed in the middle of the night

20:59.200 --> 21:02.630
and left to wander the woods for 6 hours without food or water.

21:02.700 --> 21:05.130
It's all her fault. Don't believe her.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.760
Have you told anyone else this?

21:06.830 --> 21:08.960
I told the police everything.

21:09.030 --> 21:11.630
They made me re-draw  the map.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.360
But they said she must've wandered off course.

21:14.430 --> 21:16.760
There was no sign of Courtney anywhere.

21:16.830 --> 21:20.660
What if she never comes back,and it's all because of me?

21:23.030 --> 21:24.172
I can't believe that they would leave

21:24.172 --> 21:25.500
someone out here alone out here all night.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.300
Yeah. Well. They've been doing secret hazings for years.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.800
But hopefully after all this, not anymore.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.600
Hey! Wait up!

21:32.660 --> 21:35.300
You know what? Why don't you go ahead,and I'll wait.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.330
Ok. Sure?

21:42.230 --> 21:43.430
So how sad is this?

21:43.500 --> 21:45.080
Everyone's on a rescue mission

21:45.080 --> 21:46.660
when we know it's really a recovery.

21:46.730 --> 21:48.760
Yeah. How'd it go with Courtney's sister?

21:48.830 --> 21:51.760
Emily? She's really worried and upset.

21:51.830 --> 21:53.315
She said she tried to help out Courtney

21:53.315 --> 21:54.800
by giving her a better map.

21:54.860 --> 21:57.030
Yeah? Then why is Courtney blaming her?

21:59.130 --> 22:01.500
What is that?

22:01.560 --> 22:03.460
It's a noose.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.130
It's obvious you don't have what it takes.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.430
All your fellow pledges found all their tokens

22:10.500 --> 22:12.100
And returned to their designated spots.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.530
We all know what that means.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.130
No,please. Just give me another chance.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.150
You must answer the following question

22:17.150 --> 22:18.100
correctly to be spared.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.645
What's the significance of the stars

22:19.645 --> 22:21.130
on the sigma theta chi crest?

22:21.200 --> 22:24.130
I don't...I'm not sure. They never told us.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.500
You were told the answer on your first day as a pledge.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.500
It's time to pay the consequences.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.400
What did they do to you?

22:42.460 --> 22:45.300
I won't let it happen again.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.110
So they circle Courtney like a bunch of wolves

22:53.110 --> 22:53.860
and then what?

22:53.930 --> 22:55.700
Did your vision show you how she died?

22:55.760 --> 22:57.700
No. Just that she was terrified.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.160
Do you think she froze to death?

22:59.230 --> 23:01.000
Maybe.

23:01.660 --> 23:04.400
But you saw their faces? The sorority sisters?

23:04.460 --> 23:06.395
Oh,no. I saw the "sisters."

23:06.395 --> 23:08.330
Not a group I want to be a part of.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.430
More importantly,was Emily?

23:09.500 --> 23:11.430
No,she wasn't there.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.465
You know,what'd the ghost mean

23:13.465 --> 23:15.430
when she said that "she already knows"?

23:15.500 --> 23:17.830
So,what? Emily found out after the fact?

23:17.900 --> 23:20.930
Don't know. But someone from your vision might.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.130
If we can I.D. them.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.930
All right,meet me at the sorority house. Ok?

23:28.700 --> 23:30.030
Where did I?

23:30.100 --> 23:31.860
My keys.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.260
Hey. Where you off to? You left your keys in the door.

23:36.330 --> 23:37.960
Gosh, that's not good.

23:38.030 --> 23:39.400
You on your way out?

23:39.460 --> 23:42.660
Yeah,I told Eli that I'd meet him at the house.

23:42.730 --> 23:43.930
Fire house.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.300
Wait. You're going to volunteer there,too?

23:46.360 --> 23:49.830
Yeah. Yeah. I just thought I'd answer some phones.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.960
Guess you don't have any time for a little raisin bagel.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.900
Toasted. Light cream cheese.

23:53.960 --> 23:55.200
You're really good to me.

23:55.260 --> 23:58.400
I just...I promised that I'd be there,like,now.

23:58.460 --> 23:59.175
That's sort of amazing.

23:59.175 --> 24:00.930
I mean,you just spent the entire night in the woods.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.430
And now you're going in for another shift.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.160
Yeah. Well,you know.

24:06.230 --> 24:08.645
Free time. And,uh...

24:08.645 --> 24:11.060
So,I just thought I'd help out some more.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.400
Ok. Well, please take time to eat.

24:13.460 --> 24:14.630
Yeah,I will.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.200
Ok.

24:16.260 --> 24:18.560
The girls that you saw tormenting Courtney...

24:18.630 --> 24:20.330
They didn't have any bags over their heads

24:20.400 --> 24:22.700
So that means they're current members, not pledges. Here.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.500
Ok. So, Emily's class was 2010.

24:29.660 --> 24:30.860
That's weird.

24:30.930 --> 24:32.630
What?

24:32.700 --> 24:35.130
Well,this is Emily and the girls from her class.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.800
But none of them were in my vision.

24:36.860 --> 24:38.960
So,check the year before and the year after.

24:39.030 --> 24:40.930
Ok.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.700
Nope.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.060
Not in either. But look at that.

24:49.230 --> 24:51.930
"we survived Rebecca's noose."

24:52.000 --> 24:54.600
So,that's noose the pledges were talking about.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.500
Yeah. But who's Rebecca?

24:56.560 --> 24:59.600
I don't know. She seems to be all over this book.

24:59.660 --> 25:00.760
Ok. But wait. Look at this.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.830
"heed the warning of Rebecca's noose.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.930
She preys on pledges to make them pay!"

25:06.000 --> 25:07.960
So,I'm guessing this Rebecca was sort of a legend.

25:08.030 --> 25:11.060
Apparently. And one that's been around a long time.

25:11.130 --> 25:12.830
Here's another one.

25:12.900 --> 25:14.060
"we survived hell week.

25:14.130 --> 25:17.800
Thank god we didn't get 86'd by Rebecca '68!"

25:17.860 --> 25:23.830
'68. Ok. So she was the class of '68 then,right?

25:23.900 --> 25:26.630
Uh...Here.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.060
Yeah, look.

25:32.130 --> 25:33.600
"In memorial of Rebecca kelly."

25:33.660 --> 25:36.260
So,I'm guessing that '68 wasn't the year she graduated.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.000
It was the year she died.

25:38.060 --> 25:40.000
Look,it's her obituary from the paper.

25:40.060 --> 25:41.960
"Rebecca kelly,a student at Rockland university,

25:42.030 --> 25:43.760
"was found dead on Monday of an apparent fall

25:43.830 --> 25:46.230
While on a sigma theta chi sorority nature walk."

25:46.300 --> 25:47.400
Nature walk?

25:47.460 --> 25:49.530
I'm guessing that's code for hazing.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.500
So the noose,you think they hung the pledge?

25:52.560 --> 25:54.210
Could've been an accident,

25:54.210 --> 25:55.860
or their tormenting drove her to it.

25:55.930 --> 25:56.995
Yeah. But the ghost said

25:56.995 --> 25:58.060
that she wouldn't let this happen again.

25:58.130 --> 26:01.400
So,what if what happened...

26:01.460 --> 26:03.760
Wasn't a few nights ago.

26:04.760 --> 26:06.900
What if it was 40 years ago?

26:16.530 --> 26:20.200
I know who you are. Your name is not Courtney.

26:20.260 --> 26:22.930
It's Rebecca kelly, and you died in 1968.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.800
You've been haunting the girls here ever since.

26:24.860 --> 26:29.300
Please,I want to help you. Just tell me what happened.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.600
It's all because of them.

26:33.660 --> 26:36.000
Did your sorority do this to you?

26:36.060 --> 26:37.545
It wasn't Courtney. Ok.

26:37.545 --> 26:39.030
She's just a pledge, she's innocent.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.400
They need to know what goes on.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.600
The horrible things they do to each other.

26:43.660 --> 26:45.230
A girl is missing.

26:45.300 --> 26:46.860
Did you lead her away?

26:46.930 --> 26:48.260
Do you know where she is?

26:48.330 --> 26:50.900
No one can get to her now.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.230
She's finally safe from them.

26:53.300 --> 26:54.860
What do you mean?

26:54.930 --> 26:57.460
She's my sister now.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.360
Thank you so much.

27:14.100 --> 27:16.460
Ok. Hold on.

27:16.530 --> 27:18.600
"she's my sister now."

27:18.660 --> 27:20.100
Does that mean Courtney's dead?

27:20.160 --> 27:22.460
Maybe. Or maybe the ghost is just hiding her.

27:22.530 --> 27:23.915
It sounded like she wanted to

27:23.915 --> 27:25.300
hurt the sorority,not Courtney.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.860
Well she could get her wish soon.

27:26.930 --> 27:28.860
If Courtney dies pledging,

27:28.930 --> 27:30.560
That's pretty much the end of the sorority,right?

27:30.630 --> 27:32.160
Well,maybe that's what she's going for.

27:32.230 --> 27:34.530
Maybe she's sacrificing Courtney to put an end to hazing.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.600
That is some twisted logic.

27:36.660 --> 27:38.660
I got nothing here.

27:38.730 --> 27:40.680
Grandview's paper article about Rebecca's death

27:40.680 --> 27:42.630
just calls it accidental.

27:42.700 --> 27:44.230
Same spin as the university's.

27:44.300 --> 27:45.830
Well,someone from her pledge class

27:45.830 --> 27:46.860
has to know what happened to her.

27:46.930 --> 27:48.438
We'll have to get back in that sorority

27:48.438 --> 27:50.100
and find that pledge book from '68.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.400
Or...

27:53.460 --> 27:55.300
Or we could look at this.

27:55.460 --> 27:57.160
What?!

27:57.230 --> 27:59.030
I borrowed it. Thought it might come in handy,

27:59.100 --> 28:00.810
especially after we found out that the

28:00.810 --> 28:02.700
Rebecca legend wasn't a legend after all.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.730
Nice. A little Winona Ryder action.

28:05.800 --> 28:09.200
Strange. But there's no Rebecca Kelly listed in '68.

28:09.260 --> 28:11.130
Well,maybe that's because she never finished pledging.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.000
Right. 'cause she died.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.580
Well, one of the other pledges from that year

28:13.580 --> 28:15.060
has to know what happened to her.

28:15.130 --> 28:18.700
Let's see who stuck around after graduation. All right.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.400
Carolyn Bouker...Alaska.

28:21.460 --> 28:23.200
Jennifer Myron...Nothing.

28:23.260 --> 28:24.930
Lauren Stack...Ok. Here we go.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.260
She's in Grandview.

28:39.530 --> 28:42.230
Yeah. I heard about the missing girl.

28:42.300 --> 28:44.600
It's...It's awful.

28:44.660 --> 28:46.200
It really is...

28:46.260 --> 28:48.930
And we know her disappearance had something to do with hazing.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.600
That's why we're reaching out to former sigma theta sisters.

28:51.660 --> 28:53.660
Well,I'm afraid I was never a member.

28:53.730 --> 28:56.160
I pledged as a freshman, but I dropped out.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.400
The whole thing was just horrible.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.830
Apparently it hasn't changed.

29:00.900 --> 29:02.600
So it was the same ritual back then?

29:02.660 --> 29:04.760
The bag over the heads. The search for the tokens.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.415
The freezing woods half-naked.

29:06.415 --> 29:08.000
Half the time in the rain.

29:08.060 --> 29:11.260
The night I pledged was the worst night of my life.

29:11.330 --> 29:14.130
There was a girl in your group... Rebecca Kelly.

29:14.200 --> 29:17.300
Was she one of the ones that they were especially hard on?

29:17.360 --> 29:20.830
No. She wasn't a pledge at all.

29:20.900 --> 29:22.800
She was a member. One of the leaders.

29:22.860 --> 29:24.360
Rebecca? Are you sure?

29:24.430 --> 29:27.860
Oh yeah. I'm quite sure.

29:27.930 --> 29:30.230
She was one of my tormenters.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.530
The meanest one  of them all.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.360
Congratulations,pledges.

29:36.430 --> 29:38.930
I see you've successfully retrieved your tokens.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.300
Please remove their hoods.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.960
Your fellow pledge,Lauren, not only failed her mission

29:50.030 --> 29:53.460
But failed to learn what each piece of the crest signifies.

29:53.530 --> 29:56.560
Her fate rests in your hands now.

29:56.630 --> 29:58.526
Each of you have the choice to volunteer your tokens

29:58.526 --> 30:00.660
to save Lauren from elimination.

30:00.730 --> 30:01.605
If you give up your token,

30:01.605 --> 30:03.460
You'll be able to make up for it in the next round.

30:03.530 --> 30:05.360
But if none of you decide to help her,

30:05.430 --> 30:06.960
Lauren will pay the price.

30:14.330 --> 30:17.300
I'm sorry,Lauren. But none of your fellow pledges believe you're worthy.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.830
That means you'll be left here all night

30:18.900 --> 30:21.760
to think about what it means to be a sigma theta sister.

30:21.830 --> 30:24.330
You can't leave me here! It's freezing.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.130
Stars.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.880
If you move outside of this circle before sunrise,

30:34.880 --> 30:37.760
you're finished.

30:37.830 --> 30:41.200
Your life on campus as you know it will be over.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.570
We'll make sure of that.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.840
But it's dark. I'll never find my way out of here alone.

30:44.900 --> 30:48.170
That's why you have to stay put.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.800
And don't even try following us.

30:49.870 --> 30:52.900
Remember, we're always watching.

30:52.970 --> 30:54.670
This is insane.

30:54.740 --> 30:58.100
Someone,any one of you. Don't go along with this, please.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.540
Don't leave me here. Please!

31:17.540 --> 31:21.940
Wait, wait, you know this isn't right.

31:22.940 --> 31:25.940
You were here once. Don't you remember how this felt?

31:25.940 --> 31:27.240
I'm begging you, please!

31:27.240 --> 31:28.440
Come back!

31:28.440 --> 31:33.470
I stayed there until I couldn't take the cold anymore.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.340
I managed to find my way back.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.940
And never stepped foot in that sorority again.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.200
I'm so sorry that must have been awful.

31:42.640 --> 31:45.240
The star markers that you mentioned.

31:45.300 --> 31:47.040
Did they ever use nooses in the rituals?

31:47.100 --> 31:48.500
Not that I remember.

31:48.570 --> 31:51.440
Well,then they must've started using them  after Rebecca died.

31:51.500 --> 31:53.740
So,maybe the nooses had something to do with how she died.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.170
If they're using now,

31:55.240 --> 31:57.340
It has everything to do with Rebecca's death.

31:57.400 --> 31:59.700
They said she got lost on a nature walk.

31:59.770 --> 32:01.916
But we all heard that they found her

32:01.916 --> 32:04.540
hanging off a cliff near the Yarra lookout.

32:04.600 --> 32:05.385
But if she wasn't a pledge,

32:05.385 --> 32:07.370
then why did she have a bag over her head?

32:07.440 --> 32:11.270
I doubt she did. Only pledges wear those.

32:11.340 --> 32:15.000
Look,Rebecca was cruel and heartless.

32:15.070 --> 32:17.340
I really thought I was going to die that night.

32:17.400 --> 32:21.040
And believe me,I wasn't the first pledge that she put through that.

32:21.100 --> 32:24.340
I don't think you're the last one,either.

32:49.370 --> 32:52.300
Who's there?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.109
I just can't believe the pledge I saw

33:04.109 --> 33:05.740
being tortured in my vision was Lauren.

33:06.400 --> 33:10.770
Well if the potato sack bag head look was to make pledges anonymous,

33:10.840 --> 33:11.870
It sure worked.

33:11.940 --> 33:14.370
What I don't get is, if Rebecca's a member,

33:14.440 --> 33:15.770
Then why was she dressed as a pledge?

33:15.840 --> 33:18.170
Probably another twisted part of the prank.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.800
And the way Lauren talked,

33:19.870 --> 33:23.200
Miss sigma chai latt is out there tormenting Courtney even more.

33:23.270 --> 33:25.440
Yeah,well,maybe in life she was into the sororities,

33:25.500 --> 33:28.070
but now it seems like she just wants to shut them down.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.300
And that made sense when we thought she was a victim,

33:29.370 --> 33:30.570
But she wasn't.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.900
No,she was the tormenter. Lauren's tormenter.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.440
Thanks.

33:37.500 --> 33:39.635
So,what? Then in death she becomes a reformer?

33:39.635 --> 33:40.570
So what happened?

33:40.640 --> 33:42.500
I don't know. Maybe that's what the second vision was about.

33:42.570 --> 33:44.700
Maybe the girl I saw in the woods was Lauren.

33:44.770 --> 33:47.140
Maybe that was the last thing Rebecca saw before she died.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.300
Yeah. And maybe whatever she saw stuck with her

33:49.370 --> 33:51.370
and changed her mind about everything.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.970
I'll be right back.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.500
Rebecca.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.070
Rebecca.

34:07.300 --> 34:09.639
I understand what happened that night.

34:09.699 --> 34:12.170
What you did to Lauren.

34:13.940 --> 34:15.739
It was a part of the ritual, wasn't it?

34:15.800 --> 34:19.900
You were just trying to do your part, being a good sigma theta.

34:19.969 --> 34:23.940
Weeding out the weak ones building a stronger sisterhood.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.940
That's what they said when I pledged.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.570
What I told my pledges.

34:29.639 --> 34:31.800
And I believed it.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.739
But something changed your mind.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.600
At first,all I could think was how well it went.

34:37.670 --> 34:39.800
Well,that is why you have to stay put.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.540
There always had to be one pledge who didn't make it in.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.100
But it's dark. I'll never find my way back alone.

34:44.170 --> 34:46.870
A sacrificial lamb to show how serious we were.

34:46.940 --> 34:48.699
So why not Lauren?

34:48.770 --> 34:50.070
She was timid and meek.

34:50.139 --> 34:51.540
She was the easiest to get rid of.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.670
Please stop! don't leave me here!

34:53.739 --> 34:55.100
You can't leave me...

34:55.170 --> 34:58.040
Yeah. But in the vision, she was alone.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.370
Because when I got back to the cabin,

35:00.440 --> 35:02.300
I realized that I'd dropped my flashlight.

35:02.430 --> 35:05.600
So I borrowed one of the pledge's lights and went back.

35:10.030 --> 35:13.030
I had seen lots of girls crying during the ritual,

35:13.100 --> 35:15.700
But this time Lauren got to me.

35:16.330 --> 35:19.160
She was so scared. So desperate.

35:19.830 --> 35:21.600
And we had done that to her.

35:21.860 --> 35:23.130
I had done that to her.

35:25.130 --> 35:26.530
I couldn't think of what to do.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.260
But she was clearly asking for help.

35:29.330 --> 35:32.400
Help that she didn't think she would get from any of us.

35:32.460 --> 35:34.530
Lauren had to have that dagger by sunrise.

35:34.600 --> 35:37.700
And only another pledge could give it to her. So...

35:37.760 --> 35:42.000
I had to hurry or the girls would come looking.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.130
So,I took a shortcut.

35:52.930 --> 35:55.930
I knew I wasn't supposed to be there.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.960
It was a slide area.

35:58.030 --> 36:01.200
But I had to find the token and get back to Lauren quickly.

36:04.030 --> 36:05.465
Then I heard the rumbling.

36:05.465 --> 36:07.800
I knew what it meant, but it was too late.

36:33.330 --> 36:34.800
I let her down.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.200
So,that's why you're out here?

36:36.260 --> 36:38.660
Trying to make amends for what you did to Lauren?

36:38.730 --> 36:42.400
You don't know what it's like. They did it to me,too.

36:42.460 --> 36:44.930
My supposed "sisters."

36:45.000 --> 36:47.560
They humiliated and tormented me

36:47.630 --> 36:49.400
Until they finally broke my spirit.

36:49.460 --> 36:52.800
If it was so awful, then why did you do it to other girls?

36:53.360 --> 36:54.530
Because once I was in,

36:55.130 --> 36:59.200
I felt like I was part of something special.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.430
And in my mind,the hazing...

37:01.500 --> 37:06.300
It was one of the things that made it special.

37:06.360 --> 37:10.530
That is how it works. How it keeps working.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.960
And it won't ever stop until something terrible happens.

37:14.030 --> 37:15.560
Like Courtney dying?

37:15.630 --> 37:17.100
Yes. I've tried to stop them.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.860
I've been trying for so long.

37:18.930 --> 37:21.300
But nothing gets through to them.

37:22.260 --> 37:25.460
Courtney's still alive isn't she?

37:25.530 --> 37:26.630
It won't be long now.

37:26.700 --> 37:28.230
You can't let that happen.

37:28.300 --> 37:33.160
Look,what they did to you... It was...Awful.

37:33.230 --> 37:35.300
But hurting Courtney is not gonna fix any of this.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.100
Yes,it will.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.830
It is the only thing that will.

37:39.900 --> 37:42.300
They can't cover this up.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.930
It's not about them.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.200
It's about a pledge... Just like Lauren,

37:48.260 --> 37:52.530
Who's young and scared and innocent.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
You can save Courtney.

37:56.060 --> 37:59.930
This is your chance to make it right.

38:01.500 --> 38:05.500
Please,Rebecca. Show me the way.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.730
Wait I see something!

38:38.960 --> 38:40.900
Hey,over here. We found her.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.600
Is it her?

38:48.230 --> 38:50.830
Courtney! Courtney!

38:50.900 --> 38:53.500
Oh,my god. Thank god,you're alive.

38:54.660 --> 38:56.600
You did it.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.030
You saved her.

39:09.330 --> 39:12.400
Hey,Sam,you hear? They found the girl.

39:12.460 --> 39:15.600
Yeah. Yeah,I did hear that. That's great news.

39:15.660 --> 39:17.430
Look,can I ask you a favor.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.960
I want to surprise a friend of mine.

39:19.030 --> 39:19.860
I think she volunteers here.

39:19.930 --> 39:21.560
Her name's Melinda Gordon.

39:21.630 --> 39:25.300
I don't know her. But I can check the sign in sheet if you want.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.200
All right.

39:27.260 --> 39:32.530
Melinda Gordon...Hmm. She wasn't in this morning.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.960
And...She wasn't here last night either.

39:35.030 --> 39:38.400
Well,thanks. Thanks for checking.

39:40.130 --> 39:43.530
Just in, we have cell phone footage of the moment of the rescue.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.260
This was sent to us from one of the volunteers

39:46.330 --> 39:49.130
In the first search group to find Courtney Harris.

39:49.200 --> 39:50.909
We can see several volunteers and

39:50.909 --> 39:54.700
Rescuers looking on as paramedics tend to Courtney.

39:54.760 --> 39:57.500
Courtney was reunited with her older sister Emily,

39:57.560 --> 40:01.060
Also a student as Rockland university, at the scene of the rescue.

40:02.860 --> 40:05.330
Ok. That should do for now.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.000
I'll be back with a stretcher.

40:07.450 --> 40:08.450
Thank you.

40:09.530 --> 40:11.160
Thank you.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.100
Is it true what Emily just told me?

40:15.160 --> 40:17.160
The legend of Rebecca's real,

40:17.230 --> 40:19.660
And she was out there with me?

40:19.730 --> 40:20.900
Yeah.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.500
She led us to you.

40:24.230 --> 40:26.360
I thought I felt something out there.

40:26.430 --> 40:28.260
That was her.

40:28.330 --> 40:30.600
And she's here with us right now.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.400
I should've listened to you and followed your map.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.300
No. It's ok.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.360
I should've known you'd want to do this on your own.

40:38.430 --> 40:41.360
Everyone in the sorority kept telling me that you didn't want me there.

40:41.430 --> 40:43.730
So,I just started to believe them.

40:43.800 --> 40:46.060
No. It's not that I didn't want you there.

40:46.130 --> 40:49.460
I just didn't think that you needed to join a sorority to make friends.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.700
Why? Because everything comes so easily to me?

40:52.760 --> 40:54.960
Everyone always thinks that...

40:55.030 --> 40:55.755
No, Courtney.

40:55.755 --> 40:59.730
I just didn't want you to go through what I had to go through.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.180
You know that I only wanted to join that stupid place

41:02.180 --> 41:04.560
to be with you,right?

41:14.960 --> 41:17.530
They have what I was always looking for.

41:18.860 --> 41:21.030
I know.

41:21.100 --> 41:23.360
What? What did she say?

41:23.430 --> 41:26.530
She's happy. Seeing the 2 of you together.

41:26.530 --> 41:28.830
You're true sisters.

41:30.330 --> 41:31.830
Will you thank her for me?

41:31.900 --> 41:33.830
I never would have been found without her.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.800
You helped her find the light.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.730
I think you're even.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.660
Please tell Lauren that I'm sorry.

41:46.730 --> 41:50.660
And that I tried to make it right.

41:50.730 --> 41:55.400
I will... Will tell her everything.

42:18.530 --> 42:20.630
I heard you come in.

42:21.630 --> 42:22.900
You know they found that girl?

42:22.960 --> 42:24.660
Yeah. It's great news.

42:24.730 --> 42:26.100
I mean,I think the whole town is relieved.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.660
Yeah. You're not kidding me.

42:27.730 --> 42:30.200
I was with a bunch of guys. We were about to go back up that hill.

42:30.260 --> 42:32.930
They made the announcement, everybody started cheering.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.360
Yeah. It was amazing.

42:34.430 --> 42:36.230
I mean there were definitely lots of hugs

42:36.300 --> 42:39.660
Yeah. Yeah.

42:39.730 --> 42:41.800
Where were you?

42:42.960 --> 42:45.830
The...The firehouse.

42:47.860 --> 42:49.960
Right. Yeah,you told me that. I forgot.

42:53.160 --> 42:56.630
Well,since there's happy news.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.700
How about breakfast?

43:00.430 --> 43:02.730
You know, I'm so far behind on the job site

43:02.730 --> 43:05.030
because of all this rescue stuff

43:05.100 --> 43:06.730
I should just get myself together and get back on that.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.100
Of course,sure.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.760
But thanks.

43:09.830 --> 43:11.660
So,I'll see you later then?

43:11.730 --> 43:15.130
Yeah. Of course.

43:17.530 --> 43:18.560
Later.
