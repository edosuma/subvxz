WEBVTT

00:20.540 --> 00:23.819
For today's baptism,

00:24.619 --> 00:30.939
we will be assisted by none other than
our new member of honour:

00:32.980 --> 00:35.420
St. Olaf Haraldsson.

01:04.940 --> 01:08.059
- What is the name of the child?
- Jon.

01:08.140 --> 01:10.899
Do you want Jon to be baptised
in the name of the Father,

01:11.220 --> 01:13.699
the Son and the Holy Spirit?

01:14.259 --> 01:15.259
Yes.

01:15.699 --> 01:20.179
Then,
I make the sign of the holy cross.

01:20.259 --> 01:22.940
As a testimony that you, Jon,

01:23.339 --> 01:28.580
will belong to the crucified,
and resurrected Jesus Christ.

01:30.979 --> 01:33.860
Could you take a picture with us,
too?

01:42.740 --> 01:45.259
- Thank you so much!
- My pleasure.

02:06.140 --> 02:10.259
- Did you get the water?
- The holiest water around.

02:10.979 --> 02:14.019
Sanctified by the founder
of the church himself.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.579
BEFOREIGNERS

02:22.979 --> 02:25.460
<i>If backwards time travel</i>
<i>is a possibility,</i>

02:25.539 --> 02:28.500
<i>where are</i>
<i>the tourists from the future?</i>

02:29.100 --> 02:32.579
<i>This paraphrase</i>
<i>of Professor Hawking's words</i>

02:32.660 --> 02:35.819
<i>has been used to dismiss</i>
<i>the concept of going back in time.</i>

02:35.900 --> 02:41.259
<i>My response: Future time-travellers</i>
<i>would be far too busy for tourism.</i>

02:41.340 --> 02:44.739
<i>They would most likely</i>
<i>be spending all their time</i>

02:44.819 --> 02:49.380
<i>trying to stop that first</i>
<i>little fish from crawling to shore.</i>

02:50.380 --> 02:55.819
<i>The fish to which I refer, is of course</i>
<i>that snotty little sea creature</i>

02:57.180 --> 02:59.019
<i>who decided to become</i>
<i>a land-based mammal.</i>

02:59.100 --> 03:03.460
<i>Excuse me, professor.</i>
<i>Are you saying it would be a noble act</i>

03:03.539 --> 03:06.460
<i>to prevent the evolutionary</i>
<i>step that created mankind?</i>

03:06.539 --> 03:10.780
It would be the noblest possible act.

03:11.460 --> 03:18.139
<i>Any enlightened being who could stop</i>
<i>the first fish from leaving the sea,</i>

03:18.220 --> 03:19.220
would do so.

03:19.299 --> 03:20.539
I strongly disagree, Professor.

03:20.620 --> 03:25.100
<i>If you could avert the Holocaust,</i>
<i>slavery, simply by killing a fish...</i>

03:39.579 --> 03:43.259
Have you heard about the sea horse
we have in our skulls?

03:43.340 --> 03:45.019
You mean the hippocampus?

03:45.100 --> 03:47.139
People with Temporal sleep disorder

03:47.220 --> 03:51.940
have a damaged or reduced horse,
but on my scan it was bigger.

03:52.019 --> 03:53.900
Well, isn't that good news?

03:53.979 --> 03:57.460
On the scan they first took,
it looks smaller.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.859
So your hippocampus is growing?

03:59.940 --> 04:03.900
I've started to experience some
strange stuff at least...

04:04.940 --> 04:07.380
But take the video you sent me.

04:07.460 --> 04:10.180
Even though it's in English,
I understood every word.

04:10.259 --> 04:13.699
I don't mean to be sceptical here.

04:13.780 --> 04:17.379
But I've heard you speak English.
To put it like that.

04:18.979 --> 04:23.299
Fine.
Ask me anything.

04:23.379 --> 04:26.780
- Did you sleep well tonight?
- I slept very well, thank you.

04:26.859 --> 04:30.140
- Ask me something more difficult.
- Okay.

04:32.220 --> 04:36.419
Give me a summary of
Professor Roberts' lecture.

04:36.499 --> 04:41.220
He presented a time travel paradox
that grew into a quasi-philosophical rant.

04:41.299 --> 04:45.900
Towards the end I sensed a misogynistic
tendency towards his female student.

04:45.979 --> 04:47.059
What the hell...

04:47.660 --> 04:51.419
You see?
I've become a fucking genius!

04:52.379 --> 04:54.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:00.580 --> 06:03.859
Welcome.
Roald. Transit centre leader.

06:05.859 --> 06:10.419
They were picked up by the rescue
boat from the transit centre in Son.

06:10.499 --> 06:14.700
We are authorised for timeigrants
with unconfirmed national origin,

06:14.780 --> 06:17.419
so they were sent to us.

06:18.379 --> 06:22.179
And you concluded
that they were British?

06:22.260 --> 06:25.179
Yes, everything pointed to that.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.739
Why weren't they
extradited to England?

06:27.820 --> 06:32.340
One of them spoke Norwegian. Seemed
to have had a connection to Norway.

06:32.419 --> 06:36.700
- All three resisted extradition.
- So they just stayed at the centre?

06:36.780 --> 06:42.140
Unfortunately, that often happens when
we can't establish nationality of origin.

06:42.220 --> 06:46.020
Some remain here
with status pending for years.

06:46.100 --> 06:49.020
But why weren't they
reported missing when they fled?

06:49.100 --> 06:52.059
The police only prioritise
escape cases

06:52.140 --> 06:54.460
where the escapee
is a danger to the general public.

06:54.539 --> 06:58.100
I can assure you,
we'll prioritise this case, at least.

06:58.179 --> 07:00.179
Two of the women have been murdered.

07:00.260 --> 07:02.580
We fear the same might happen
to the third.

07:02.660 --> 07:05.379
Oh my God.
Do you know who killed them?

07:05.460 --> 07:07.580
No one has been formally charged.

07:07.660 --> 07:12.780
Did an English speaking contemporary
man contact you about them?

07:15.059 --> 07:16.780
Anything you would like to share?

07:16.859 --> 07:20.299
A genealogist called
from a university in England

07:20.379 --> 07:21.900
with some questions about the women.

07:21.979 --> 07:25.780
I know I'm not supposed to share
information without a formal query.

07:25.859 --> 07:29.059
But he was very persuasive
and credible.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.900
I'm looking for a
lady called Nessie Olssen.

08:05.979 --> 08:11.020
Ms. Olssen is expecting you
in room 303.

08:11.660 --> 08:14.979
- She is expecting me?
- That's what she said.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.940
The door is open.

08:55.499 --> 08:57.540
You look different.

08:59.940 --> 09:05.739
A new man has entered my life.
A gentleman named Jesus Christ.

09:05.820 --> 09:11.300
I hate to break it to you, but Mr Christ
has a reputation for being unfaithful.

09:12.659 --> 09:15.499
I must say you
are being remarkably calm.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.779
The others went crazy
when I came for them.

09:17.859 --> 09:19.859
The redhead
even pulled a knife on me.

09:19.940 --> 09:24.220
I told her knives and bullets
wouldn't bite on a creature like you.

09:24.300 --> 09:28.300
- What bites on a creature like me?
- This.

09:29.019 --> 09:30.859
You're going to hit me on the head?

09:30.940 --> 09:32.700
I will defeat you
with the power of the spirit.

09:32.779 --> 09:37.499
The light of Jesus our savior
will extinguish your darkness!

09:37.580 --> 09:42.139
Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem,
Creatorem caeli et terrae.

09:42.220 --> 09:46.300
Et in Iesum Christum, Filium
Eius unicum, Dominum nostrum.

09:46.379 --> 09:50.460
Qui conceptus est de Spiritu
Sancto, natus ex Maria Virgine.

09:50.540 --> 09:54.259
Credo in Spiritum Sanctum,
sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam.

09:54.580 --> 09:57.739
Sanctorum communionem,
remissionem peccatorum.

09:57.820 --> 10:01.300
Carnis resurrectionem,
vitam aeternam.

10:16.779 --> 10:21.100
Sorry to ruin the moment.
I couldn't resist that.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.580
You're coming with me.

10:29.180 --> 10:31.259
Credo..

10:40.340 --> 10:42.940
Give me your best shot.

10:58.139 --> 10:59.619
Bullseye!

11:14.779 --> 11:16.700
- So, nice flight?
- Yes.

11:24.259 --> 11:26.259
What did they say at the transit?

11:26.340 --> 11:28.899
An English contemporary
man had asked about the women.

11:28.979 --> 11:32.300
Can you get a picture of the
third woman out to the press?

11:32.379 --> 11:37.019
I have a feeling the killer
is quite a few steps ahead of us here.

11:46.700 --> 11:51.420
We need to bring Mr. Haaland
and Ms. Enginnsdottir in on this.

11:51.859 --> 11:54.940
We got the impression
that they'd been taken off the case?

11:55.019 --> 11:57.820
Well, I reversed my decision.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.060
Lars?
Alfhildr?

12:05.940 --> 12:10.659
<i>The Timeigration Directorate decided</i>
<i>to appeal Olaf Haraldsson's case.</i>

12:10.739 --> 12:15.619
<i>Haraldsson had his application</i>
<i>accepted for identity establishment.</i>

12:15.700 --> 12:18.100
<i>But TDI will now</i>
<i>appeal the decision to the court.</i>

12:19.060 --> 12:23.139
Does the shit never end in this time?

12:26.420 --> 12:28.899
Watch the chassis.
I just had it EU checked.

12:28.979 --> 12:31.060
Shut the fuck up!

12:32.580 --> 12:35.659
We need to reevaluate
the case in light of the new murders.

12:35.739 --> 12:38.899
Do you agree we can rule out
Isaac Ben Joseph as a suspect now?

12:38.979 --> 12:44.300
Not at all. But it's starting to look
like Ben Joseph had an accomplice.

12:48.499 --> 12:51.619
Why do you think Ben Joseph
and Roberts are accomplices?

12:51.700 --> 12:56.659
Could we start by explaining who
Mr. Roberts is? This is all new to me.

12:56.739 --> 13:01.940
A controversial physics professor
who went missing a few years ago.

13:02.019 --> 13:05.979
Our current theory is that both men
suffer from grave mental illness.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.420
How about Alfhildr's question?

13:08.499 --> 13:12.100
What makes you believe Isaac Ben
Joseph works together with this man?

13:12.180 --> 13:16.300
Information that surfaced during
our interrogations of Mr. Joseph.

13:18.060 --> 13:20.540
They're lying through their teeth.

13:22.820 --> 13:25.460
How could they know
who we're investigating?

13:28.700 --> 13:31.899
I think we should talk
about this outside.

13:33.899 --> 13:35.180
Olaf?

13:42.779 --> 13:43.899
Hi!

13:46.700 --> 13:50.220
- Hey. You're back already?
- Yes.

13:50.739 --> 13:54.180
Sure am.
What are you doing?

13:54.259 --> 13:57.460
Seeking support in God

13:57.540 --> 14:01.259
for new battles with
the Timeigration Directorate.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.220
Did you just snort a line of cocaine?

14:08.859 --> 14:13.180
We live together.
We have to be able to talk about things.

14:19.060 --> 14:25.420
So let's talk about why the hell
you've started wearing jeans again.

14:26.139 --> 14:30.499
You know those trousers are ungodly.

14:31.420 --> 14:34.460
You're fucking unbelievable.

14:34.540 --> 14:39.899
Doing coke in the middle of the day,
and attacking me for my trousers?

14:41.979 --> 14:46.019
Aslakr and Gegnir will help you pack.

14:46.580 --> 14:47.859
What?

14:48.659 --> 14:54.979
I'm dumping you, girl.
That shouldn't be so hard to understand.

14:55.979 --> 15:00.540
What about the volva's vision?
We saw that we belong together.

15:06.859 --> 15:08.739
We missaw.

15:11.379 --> 15:15.259
So, you think one of ours is feeding
them info under the table?

15:15.340 --> 15:18.659
And you suspect Alex?
Skitr...

15:19.619 --> 15:24.019
What's the motive for London
for obscuring a murder investigation?

15:24.100 --> 15:25.859
I have a theory.

15:26.619 --> 15:30.540
Management would probably think
I was crazy again if I told them about it.

15:30.619 --> 15:31.859
Let's hear it.

15:35.779 --> 15:40.940
What if the English police sent John back
in time, as part of a secret operation?

15:41.859 --> 15:45.460
And now they're worried
our investigation will uncover it?

15:49.060 --> 15:52.979
Do you have any kind of evidence
that such operations exist?

15:53.499 --> 15:57.340
I have come across things in
my spare time that might indicate that.

15:57.420 --> 16:00.499
What are we waiting for?
Show me what you found.

16:05.019 --> 16:08.779
I wasn't really myself
when I found those things.

16:08.859 --> 16:13.259
- What's that supposed to mean?
- After quitting Temproxat, I've...

16:13.340 --> 16:17.259
- I've had a couple of relapses.
- Skitr...

16:17.820 --> 16:20.619
I realise this is
a little outside the box.

16:20.700 --> 16:25.019
But I need the drops
if I'm going to dive into this again.

16:40.180 --> 16:42.979
I'll take the drops
under your supervision.

16:43.060 --> 16:46.979
If it doesn't work, you just have
to make sure I don't fall off the wagon.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.460
What kind of authorisation
do I have to stop you?

16:50.540 --> 16:54.779
- Whatever you need.
- This could actually be kind of fun.

17:34.820 --> 17:39.500
- What's wrong?
- Olaf ditched me.

17:45.260 --> 17:48.340
Madelaine...
This'll be okay.

17:51.699 --> 17:54.939
But I'll never meet
another guy like Olaf.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.179
This isn't you.

17:58.260 --> 18:01.459
Where's that girl who shared
Perry's dick-pics when he cheated?

18:01.540 --> 18:03.659
This isn't Perry!

18:05.459 --> 18:07.219
Olaf Haraldsson.

18:10.780 --> 18:15.139
Fuck him!
You don't need him. Fuck him!

18:21.740 --> 18:24.540
Do you have anything on the guy?

18:57.659 --> 19:00.419
Are you coming?

19:01.219 --> 19:04.139
<i>The police believe the woman</i>
<i>may have information</i>

19:04.219 --> 19:09.020
<i>regarding an ongoing investigation and</i>
<i>ask for tips about where she may be.</i>

19:32.619 --> 19:35.459
Are you taking a bath in there, or...

19:41.820 --> 19:44.300
Can you tell me
where we're going now?

19:49.980 --> 19:53.740
Relax.
I've got the situation under control.

19:54.939 --> 19:57.219
I set up a proxy server down here.

19:57.780 --> 20:01.300
The internet provider
started to become a little clingy.

20:27.379 --> 20:29.859
Is this the Onion Router?

20:32.580 --> 20:34.859
The one who peels the onion,

20:36.899 --> 20:38.340
shall find answers.

21:01.580 --> 21:03.540
Good morning.

21:04.419 --> 21:06.980
Morning.
Thank you.

21:09.619 --> 21:11.699
Did we find anything yesterday?

21:12.740 --> 21:15.780
I printed what seemed most relevant.

21:15.859 --> 21:19.619
These are leaked documents
connected to Project 19.

21:19.699 --> 21:24.899
An English plan to send agents
back to the 19th century.

21:26.060 --> 21:31.419
But those who have uploaded it
seem like the conspiratorial kind.

21:33.179 --> 21:37.219
The question is
how we take this further.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.300
Project 19...

21:39.379 --> 21:43.419
I think it's best we start
by keeping this completely to ourselves.

21:46.619 --> 21:49.939
Welcome to Oslo Police Station.
How can I help?

21:54.060 --> 21:56.179
Oslo Police Station,
how can I help you?

21:56.260 --> 21:59.899
<i>This is Jack.</i>
<i>Let me speak to the chief of police.</i>

22:01.300 --> 22:03.379
We have no times for prank calls.

22:08.980 --> 22:10.060
Where are you going?

22:10.139 --> 22:13.459
A 19th century guy
has been found dead at a hotel.

22:13.540 --> 22:16.219
The receptionist
claims the woman we reported missing

22:16.300 --> 22:20.020
had booked the room
where the man was found dead.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.540
What on earth has been going on here?

23:10.899 --> 23:13.260
Did we all get the same email now?

23:14.419 --> 23:18.500
- I mean, this could be a virus.
- We'll just have to take that chance.

23:26.219 --> 23:30.580
TONIGHT

23:30.980 --> 23:33.619
I'm glad you could step in
at such short notice.

23:33.699 --> 23:37.300
- Your mother was detained at work.
- No worries.

23:38.419 --> 23:42.060
- So...
- Do you want some help with that?

23:42.139 --> 23:45.459
That won't be necessary.
Come. Let's go.

23:45.540 --> 23:48.139
- Okay.
- Time to get out of here.

23:52.659 --> 23:55.780
Could you stop by Valentin's grave?

23:57.780 --> 24:01.379
I was on my way there to tend to it,
when the hullabaloo occurred.

24:33.419 --> 24:37.500
Let's hope the lilies will manage
in the cold for a few days.

24:38.219 --> 24:39.580
Yes.

24:42.859 --> 24:45.740
- Is something perturbing you?
- No.

24:47.899 --> 24:53.540
It was thoughtless of me to bring you
down here in your present condition.

24:56.939 --> 25:00.459
What do you think about it, actually?
Do you agree with mum?

25:03.859 --> 25:09.340
I will support you through the storm,
no matter what choice you make.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.859
I don't know if I've told you
before, Gregers,

25:16.939 --> 25:20.219
but I'm very lucky
to have you as my stepdad.

25:23.419 --> 25:27.980
You cannot fathom
how warming those words are.

25:40.740 --> 25:44.340
We're setting up
the tracking device now.

25:50.899 --> 25:53.459
The phone operator is ready,
over and out.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.459
Yes...

26:18.060 --> 26:19.500
Sure.

26:26.740 --> 26:28.300
Asphyxiation.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.859
Twelve letter word,
breathing difficulty.

26:53.780 --> 26:57.699
This is Grete Skog,
Chief of the Oslo Police Department.

26:58.179 --> 27:01.020
I'm glad you finally took the time.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.659
<i>You are most likely trying to trace</i>
<i>this call, so I'll keep it brief.</i>

27:05.740 --> 27:10.540
<i>I am calling to offer you a trade.</i>
<i>The woman for Mr. Henry Black.</i>

27:13.419 --> 27:15.780
- Who's Henry Black?
- Don't be daft.

27:16.179 --> 27:18.659
He's right there with you, isn't he?

27:19.340 --> 27:21.980
The Oslo police
do not trade in humans.

27:23.699 --> 27:26.699
Well, in that case the woman dies.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.939
If you happen to change your mind,

27:29.020 --> 27:33.580
<i>Henry Black must be at the Grønland</i>
<i>tube station at noon tomorrow.</i>

27:35.300 --> 27:37.300
Hello?

27:38.379 --> 27:42.419
<i>- He hung up. Over.</i>
<i>- Did we get anything? Over.</i>

27:43.139 --> 27:45.619
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>Over and out.</i>

27:54.500 --> 27:58.580
I need to confer with our legal team
on how this can be arranged.

27:58.659 --> 28:01.740
- You're considering to do the switch?
- It's getting late.

28:01.820 --> 28:04.780
- Let's reconvene in the morning.
- Okay.

28:21.379 --> 28:25.580
There. Let's. Would you like this one?
Are you okay?

28:26.300 --> 28:28.699
Are you sitting alright?

28:31.859 --> 28:34.619
Well, the assault on me
was not incidental.

28:34.699 --> 28:37.100
The culprits were sent by this Sturla.

28:37.859 --> 28:40.060
The target was not me, but Lars.

28:40.139 --> 28:43.219
But why
would Sturla's guys assault Lars?

28:43.300 --> 28:46.260
I approached him
a couple of days earlier.

28:46.340 --> 28:50.699
Asked him to stop bothering Ingrid.
Then he started running his mouth...

28:50.780 --> 28:55.139
The fatherly instinct can disrupt
reason's control over the emotions.

28:55.219 --> 28:58.899
For heaven's sake!
Our daughter has to get an abortion

28:58.980 --> 29:01.300
after a one night stand
with a psychopath.

29:01.379 --> 29:04.699
- And you add fuel to the fire?
- It wasn't my intention. I was...

29:04.780 --> 29:08.500
It doesn't matter.
Because I've decided to keep the baby.

29:10.379 --> 29:13.060
I'm very confused now, Ingrid.

29:13.139 --> 29:17.659
Gregers made me understand
what this is really about.

29:17.740 --> 29:21.540
- I'm not sure what I might have said.
- No, what might that have been?

29:21.619 --> 29:23.980
Don't make this about you two.

29:24.060 --> 29:27.100
I understood that it's me and no one
else who has to make this choice.

29:27.179 --> 29:30.619
And what makes you believe
that this is the right choice?

29:32.020 --> 29:34.899
You're going to be a grandmother.
Deal with it.

29:50.580 --> 29:54.459
Hello!
The parish is full of expectations.

29:54.540 --> 29:56.899
- Good.
- Welcome.

30:07.260 --> 30:10.740
The church has forgotten
how power works.

30:12.859 --> 30:14.780
What do you mean?

30:15.859 --> 30:19.699
If you want power,
you have to radiate success.

30:19.780 --> 30:24.219
You have to surround yourself with
beautiful women, gold and glitter.

30:24.300 --> 30:30.020
Not a group of old hags munching
sugarloaf in a dump of a house.

30:31.699 --> 30:36.060
- Take it easy, Olaf.
- Hi.

30:37.219 --> 30:40.740
I am the leader
of the evangelic history team.

30:40.820 --> 30:46.939
And we're doing a team study
of the role of women in Viking culture.

30:48.659 --> 30:51.820
Do you have time
for a coffee and a chat?

30:51.899 --> 30:54.659
I need to go to the toilet first.

31:30.899 --> 31:33.859
Have a look at this story that was
just published in the news.

31:33.939 --> 31:37.060
It says they've confiscated drugs.

31:49.580 --> 31:53.899
The police found
a bag of cocaine at the vicarage.

31:53.980 --> 31:59.740
- The story is out already.
- Why the hell were the police there?

32:00.540 --> 32:05.459
Gegnir said it seemed
like they had received a tip.

32:07.780 --> 32:13.580
Madeleine. That bitter little whore
must be behind it.

32:18.139 --> 32:23.699
The Bishop just called.
What is going on at the vicarage?

32:23.780 --> 32:29.780
God knows. This must...
This must be some worker.

32:29.859 --> 32:32.580
With ungodly habits.

32:32.659 --> 32:36.260
Unfortunately, the church will have
to disassociate itself from you

32:36.340 --> 32:39.139
until this has been sorted out.

32:40.139 --> 32:44.500
The church wants
to disassociate itself from me?

32:46.859 --> 32:50.340
I built this church.

32:50.419 --> 32:54.219
My men gave their blood for the cross.
What did you do?

32:54.300 --> 32:59.020
Sit on your ass eating sugarloaf
with a bunch of dried up cunts!

33:14.060 --> 33:16.659
- Where do we go?
- Certainly not back to the vicarage.

33:16.740 --> 33:21.780
Gegnir said the police seemed eager
to bring you in for questioning.

33:22.899 --> 33:26.740
- Get out and walk.
- But Olaf...

33:26.820 --> 33:29.740
You can't drive
without a supervising driver.

33:31.340 --> 33:33.060
Bloody hell!

33:38.419 --> 33:40.500
There.
Out.

34:06.859 --> 34:07.980
Hi, Alex.

34:08.060 --> 34:11.500
<i>I'm just calling to let you know</i>
<i>I'm not feeling too well.</i>

34:11.580 --> 34:15.219
<i>- I better just stay in bed.</i>
<i>- Are you kidding me?</i>

34:15.299 --> 34:18.139
This is not the day
to play the PMS card.

34:18.219 --> 34:21.980
Will you excuse us for two seconds?

34:25.500 --> 34:28.420
- How do you feel?
- Like I'm too old for this shit.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.619
Our Norwegian partners have decided
to prepare the temporal agent.

34:31.699 --> 34:35.420
- Just in case something goes wrong.
- Is that really necessary?

34:46.460 --> 34:48.460
Have we given them full control?

34:48.540 --> 34:52.259
The operation will be led by
Oslo and London in collaboration.

34:53.819 --> 34:55.819
I have a bad feeling about this.

34:55.900 --> 34:59.219
When management have given the guy
authorisation to play the hero,

34:59.299 --> 35:01.020
there isn't much we can do.

35:13.339 --> 35:16.460
- You look tired.
- Everything is going to hell.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.779
And it's your fault.

35:25.860 --> 35:28.339
Your problems are temporary.

35:29.739 --> 35:33.139
I know that you will
sit on the throne again.

35:33.659 --> 35:36.540
- Stop it.
- I've seen it.

35:36.619 --> 35:38.860
Those are just fantasies.

35:40.380 --> 35:44.819
Was it fantasies that stopped
your death at Stiklestad, too?

35:44.900 --> 35:48.500
That foresaw that
you would be reborn in the water?

35:48.580 --> 35:51.219
How am I to rise again
in this fucked up world?

35:51.299 --> 35:56.219
And how can this Enginnsdottir have
any role to play? It makes no sense.

35:56.299 --> 35:59.020
We have to go deeper into the vision.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.819
It's time to go see her.

36:14.299 --> 36:18.179
This is a technical test
from operational leader OPK.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.900
<i>Are you there operational leader MPS?</i>
<i>Over.</i>

36:20.980 --> 36:24.299
<i>Operational leader MPS replying.</i>
<i>We hear you loud and clear.</i>

36:24.380 --> 36:28.860
<i>Continuing check on all OPK vehicles.</i>
<i>Are you there, Enginnsdottir? Over.</i>

36:28.940 --> 36:31.139
We hear you, Harald, over.

36:31.219 --> 36:36.060
<i>Reminding all OPK vehicles to use</i>
<i>the operational language. Over and out.</i>

36:38.819 --> 36:44.699
<i>Operational leader MPS to OPK.</i>
<i>Mr. Black will take his position, over.</i>

37:05.779 --> 37:10.739
<i>Operational leader MPS, please</i>
<i>confirm sound on Mr. Black. Over.</i>

37:11.540 --> 37:14.659
<i>Operational leader MPS.</i>
<i>Sound confirmed, over.</i>

37:15.179 --> 37:18.739
We're not exactly radiating
full control here.

37:29.339 --> 37:31.819
Enginnsdottir to MPS.

37:31.900 --> 37:35.500
<i>Does Mr. Black's sound give</i>
<i>any clue on what's going on? Over.</i>

37:35.580 --> 37:38.619
Part of the communication
was in Norwegian.

37:38.699 --> 37:41.420
<i>We're trying to decipher it now.</i>
<i>Over.</i>

37:50.900 --> 37:56.179
Enginnsdottir to all vehicles.
Black just left his position, over.

37:59.980 --> 38:03.900
This is Haaland asking permission
to follow Mr. Black on foot, over.

38:04.940 --> 38:08.380
<i>Instructions were</i>
<i>to keep position or abort, over.</i>

38:19.060 --> 38:23.139
<i>We still have a pending request</i>
<i>from one of our vehicles. Over.</i>

38:25.460 --> 38:29.699
<i>Operational leader MPS to operational</i>
<i>leader OPK. What is your question?</i>

38:29.779 --> 38:31.179
Fuck this.

38:53.819 --> 38:55.860
Okay, I'm here. Now what?

38:55.940 --> 38:59.100
<i>Now you go into the tunnel.</i>
<i>Go east.</i>

39:01.339 --> 39:04.420
Are you out of your mind?
The trains are coming.

39:04.779 --> 39:06.659
Not anymore.

39:09.739 --> 39:10.900
Okay.

39:16.860 --> 39:21.339
Operational leader OPK to Enginnsdottir,
please come in, over?

39:21.420 --> 39:24.980
<i>Enginnsdottir to OPK.</i>
<i>Haaland and I are entering...</i>

39:25.060 --> 39:27.819
<i>It seems Mr. Black</i>
<i>has gone into the tunnels.</i>

39:27.900 --> 39:31.819
- Await further instructions, over.
- Negative.

39:33.420 --> 39:35.860
<i>We must act...</i>
<i>Or...</i>

39:35.940 --> 39:38.380
Hello?
You're breaking up.

39:48.179 --> 39:49.860
Long time no see, Henry.

39:51.900 --> 39:53.900
How is your backhand these days?

40:01.060 --> 40:03.420
The woman is already dead, I assume.

40:04.699 --> 40:09.179
- Your assumption is correct, yes.
- What has been the point of all this?

40:10.020 --> 40:14.980
Those girls all saw me way back when.
They could have exposed P19.

40:15.060 --> 40:16.100
Why all the theatrics?

40:16.179 --> 40:20.500
- The man upstairs doesn't like it messy.
- The man upstairs is a cunt, Henry.

40:22.739 --> 40:25.380
He screwed me over when I returned.

40:25.460 --> 40:28.619
I guess this is just my way
of sticking it back up his ass.

40:29.339 --> 40:32.139
Where do you think
we're going to go from here?

40:32.219 --> 40:36.259
Put me in a manor house with jolly girls
and a generous wine cellar.

40:36.900 --> 40:38.819
I'll be gone for ever.

40:39.659 --> 40:41.699
Why did you kill
those women in Whitechapel?

40:41.779 --> 40:44.940
Guinea pigs to test
my improvised time travel device.

40:45.020 --> 40:47.860
- And the mutilation?
- Just covering my tracks.

40:49.020 --> 40:50.500
Creatively.

40:51.100 --> 40:55.540
We don't want the agency's temporal
knowledge in the wrong hands, do we?

40:56.900 --> 41:00.500
Why do I feel you're dodging
the essence of my question?

41:00.580 --> 41:01.619
Which is?

41:02.299 --> 41:06.259
How a man I once consided a friend,
could turn into Jack the Ripper.

41:06.339 --> 41:07.739
Oh Henry...

41:09.060 --> 41:13.179
You still don't understand
anything about time, do you?

41:14.100 --> 41:15.819
I was always Jack.

41:16.699 --> 41:18.380
Whatever you are...

41:20.139 --> 41:21.380
It ends here.

41:42.420 --> 41:45.299
Did you manage
to plot her address into the GPS?

41:45.380 --> 41:50.540
- I think so.
- Does this journey has a purpose?

41:50.619 --> 41:55.420
We'll find the answer when we meet her.
She is the key to our rebirth.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.980
- I have seen it.
- I need more of the divine dust.

42:45.580 --> 42:49.860
<i>You have reached</i>
<i>the voicemail of 4540...</i>

43:15.940 --> 43:17.940
Forget this world.

43:20.139 --> 43:22.540
A new one is about to be born.

43:24.900 --> 43:26.659
You are back on the throne,

43:27.619 --> 43:29.420
and I am your queen.

43:30.339 --> 43:34.860
We love each other,
and the gods love us.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.739
Stop!
Police.

43:47.699 --> 43:51.219
Trust me. It's better for both of us
if you put that thing away.

43:51.299 --> 43:54.540
Lay down on the ground
and put your hands on your head!

44:10.020 --> 44:11.500
Sorry.

44:32.980 --> 44:34.540
Alfhildr!

44:36.940 --> 44:38.299
You're like me?

44:41.699 --> 44:43.500
A fellow two-way traveller?

44:43.980 --> 44:47.980
I am nothing like you.
And now I'm bringing you in.

44:48.819 --> 44:50.420
A little scientific heads up:

44:50.500 --> 44:52.900
I don't know what happens
to the space-time continuum

44:52.980 --> 44:55.219
if two creatures like us
confront each other.

44:55.299 --> 44:58.259
What the fuck
is space-time continuum?

44:58.339 --> 45:00.100
I like your attitude.
