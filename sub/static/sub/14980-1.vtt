He talked
a bunch ofcrap
about Ms. McCartney.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.962
ReaHy?
What did he say?

11:59.052 --> 12:02.135
The kid’s a freak. I mean,
I can’t remember exactly,

12:02.222 --> 12:06.261
but... I’m sure I heard him say
something psycho about her.

12:06.351 --> 12:11.015
You wouldn’tjust be saying that
because you got suspended
for hitting him in the face?

12:14.192 --> 12:17.059
I was in bio lab with him.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.772
You know, I don’t see
how he could’ve done
what they’re saying he did.

12:20.866 --> 12:24.233
It’sjust—
Well, I don’t believe it.

12:24.328 --> 12:27.820
/ mean, I’ve never
even seen him get angiy.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.906
Why would he want
to kill her anyway?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.584
[Inhales, Exhales Sharply]

12:33.670 --> 12:35.661
[Inaudible]

12:38.216 --> 12:40.628
Are you feeling emotional
in any way right now,
Jacquehn?

12:40.719 --> 12:43.631
Um, no.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.839
- It’s okay ifyou are.
- | feel fine.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.936
[Cal]
Deputy Bonds.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.063
And what did you learn
in school today?

12:59.154 --> 13:01.691
Fifty-seven classmates,
and not one credible account...

13:01.782 --> 13:03.613
of antecedent aggression
fromJames.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.362
I need to see the case file
and look at the other suspects
Homicide questioned.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.990
- What? You don’t think
James Cole is guilty?
- I don’t know.

13:09.081 --> 13:10.992
But ifthe prosecutor wants
to send a kid my daughter’s age...

13:11.083 --> 13:13.449
to a cell block
with pedophiles
and serial killers,

13:13.585 --> 13:16.327
I wouldn’t mind
knowing for sure.
Whatever you need

13:22.719 --> 13:26.211
- All right.
- took, forget it.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.922
- We’ll find another one.
- No. Maybe he didn ’t see me.

13:29.059 --> 13:32.927
Why don’t you get out?
Just drive.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.159
Hi.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.908
- You didn’t see me
waiting for that space?
- I didn’t see ya.

13:51.999 --> 13:55.036
- Really?
- No, I did not see you.

13:55.127 --> 13:58.460
|— I was waiting too.
You must not have seen me.

13:58.547 --> 14:01.209
That’s fantastic.
Classic gestural slip.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.541
You got the slightest
head nod yes before
you shook your head no.

14:06.263 --> 14:09.926
Look, I’m in the space,
and I’m not going anwihere.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.349
That’s true.

14:14.146 --> 14:17.309
Hey! You can’t
block me in like that!

14:19.985 --> 14:22.067
Congratulations.
One liar down,

14:22.154 --> 14:24.611
six and a half billion
to go.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.832
Well, the US. Attorney’s Office
scheduled the transfer hearing.
We have two days.

14:37.919 --> 14:41.047
/ told the mayor’s office
we need to examine
/ames ’s antecedent beha vior.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.292
So we’re set to meet
with his parents
and his church group.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.086
How are you doing
today, sir?
I’m great.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.381
Good. Could you step
out ofthe line, please?
Are you serious?

14:48.472 --> 14:50.008
Yeah.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.222
Any reason you might be
anxious this morning, sir?

14:56.313 --> 14:58.269
No, only that
I’ll miss my ﬂight.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.563
I need you to open
your briefcase for me.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.481
I’m gonna check it.
It’s the liquids, right?

15:02.569 --> 15:06.153
Stop. T-3 B, backup.
Backup, T-3 B. Open your briefcase.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.117
You’re gonna need
to come with us.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.374
Actually, you need
to come with us.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.131
When you leaned out of line,
I could tell you were
jacked up about something.

15:27.219 --> 15:30.336
That’s ’cause I flashed you
a partial fear expression.

15:30.430 --> 15:35.049
Whatever.
But why were you trying
to play me?

15:35.143 --> 15:36.644
Six years ago,
Dr. Lightman left...

15:36.728 --> 15:39.470
the Deception Detection
Program he founded
for the Defense Department.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.816
Together, we stan‘ed
a private ﬁrm that works
with police, corporations,

15:41.900 --> 15:44.892
and almost every
federal agency.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.853
- We’d like you to come
work for us, Ms. Torres.
- Why?

15:47.948 --> 15:50.940
You’ve made seven times
more arrests than
the average T.S.A. agent,

15:51.034 --> 15:55.494
and you scored 97% on
the T.S.A. Deception Diagnostic,
which Dr. Lightman created.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.787
Have you ever had any
specialized deception training?

15:57.874 --> 16:00.206
I’ve dated a lot of men.

16:02.045 --> 16:05.253
You’re one of the naturals.
There’s an infinitesimal
percentage of the population,

16:05.340 --> 16:09.299
less than .00 7,
that test nearly perfect
without any advanced training.

16:09.386 --> 16:12.128
We ’ve already cleared
your lea ving with
the T5.A. ﬁeld director.

16:12.222 --> 16:14.964
Our office will
call you later.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.264
Oh, uh, don’t forget
your briefcase.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.391
That’s your signing bonus.

16:28.113 --> 16:31.355
Ijust had a long conversation
with the school
guidance counselor.

16:31.449 --> 16:34.941
The girl whose breathing
you said was fast and shallow,
Jacquelin Mathis,

16:35.036 --> 16:38.654
has had three appomtments
with the school nurse
in the past two weeks.

16:38.748 --> 16:42.582
Guidance guy said typically,
that could be about drugs
or an STD.

16:42.669 --> 16:47.413
You know, gonorrhea,
clap, crabs, uh—

16:47.507 --> 16:50.544
Find out ifJacquelin
has any connection with
James Cole outside of school.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.259
And follow up
with the nurse.
Okay.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.177
Did the school principal
seem tense to you?

16:55.265 --> 16:57.756
Wouldn’t you be ifthis
happened at your school?

16:57.851 --> 17:01.218
Well, he had his left hand
in his pants pocket pressed
against his leg the whole time.

17:01.313 --> 17:04.396
- We’re not all
hiding something.
- Okay.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.724
You think I’m naive
just because I don’t share
your twisted view ofthe world.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.686
- That, and you read
romance novels.
- Yes, I do.

17:10.780 --> 17:14.773
Because they make me happy.
A pursuit I highly
recommend to you.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.450
Truth or happiness.
Never both.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.949
- [Slurping]
- What is that now?

17:20.040 --> 17:23.373
- Orange slushy.
- How old are you?

17:23.460 --> 17:27.328
Chairman Baldridge
from the Democratic National
Committee is on the phone.

17:27.422 --> 17:30.789
- Some sort of crisis.
- Politician. That’s all you.

17:32.761 --> 17:36.003
Charge him by the lie.
We can retire tomorrow.

17:36.139 --> 17:39.347
Why isn’t Dr. Lightman here?
Cal really wanted
to make it.

17:39.434 --> 17:42.050
[Chuckles]
He’s a better liar
than you are.

17:42.187 --> 17:45.520
He’s a better liar
than all ofus.
I need your help, Gillian.

17:45.607 --> 17:50.271
Congressman Zeb Weil,
whose career I’ve spent
20 years building,

17:50.362 --> 17:52.273
is about to be accused
of paying for sex.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.355
A friend at the Post
gave me the tip.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.031
But I need to know the truth
before the story breaks.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.025
You think it could be
a smearjob?
I do.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.611
But allegedly,
Congressman Weil frequents...

18:01.706 --> 18:05.449
some sort ofhigh-priced
escort service at an
underground club in Georgetown.

18:05.543 --> 18:09.331
Now ifthat’s true,
it’s gonna be
a PR. nightmare,

18:09.422 --> 18:12.289
because he’s the new chairman
ofthe House Ethics Committee.

18:12.384 --> 18:16.172
That’s delightful.
But we don’t go through
people’s dirty laundry.

18:16.263 --> 18:19.630
So Dr. Lightman just assumes
you’re a liar
ifyou’re a politician?

18:19.724 --> 18:22.511
He assumes you’re a liar
ifyou’re a Homo sapien.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.558
Ifthese allegations
are false,

18:24.646 --> 18:28.309
are you gonna stand by
while an innocent man
is destroyed by lies?

18:37.075 --> 18:38.986
Thanks for coming in
right away.
You’re the boss.

18:39.077 --> 18:42.285
I would like
to sleep with you.

18:42.372 --> 18:45.114
Uh, Eli Loker,
Ria Torres.
He’s harmless.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.575
Just always speaks the truth
about what’s on his mind.
What do you call it again?

18:48.670 --> 18:50.752
- Radical honesty.
- That’s it.

18:50.839 --> 18:53.672
Well, he’ll get you started
on learning our
facial coding system.

18:53.758 --> 18:58.502
I have no chance with you.
No. Uh, do l have
any chance with you?

18:58.638 --> 19:01.220
You always tell the truth?
Always.

19:01.349 --> 19:04.466
How good are you in bed?
Fair.

19:04.561 --> 19:07.553
Fair’s better than most.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.521
I don’t see why
you need to look
inJames’s bedroom.

19:13.611 --> 19:17.695
Mr. Cole, anything
that gets us a better sense
ofyour son is helpful.

19:19.242 --> 19:22.734
-James took these?
- [Woman]
Yes, he did.

19:27.751 --> 19:33.496
We let him convert that
bathroom to a darkroom
for his photography.

19:33.590 --> 19:35.501
That a problem?

19:35.592 --> 19:39.585
Well, it was taking too much
time from his responsibilities
as a Witness doing God’s work.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.716
What didJames tell you
about Ms. McCartney?

19:42.807 --> 19:46.095
He thought she was
a good teacher.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.518
And did you?

19:49.606 --> 19:51.517
[ Woman]
/ames did not kill that woman.

19:51.608 --> 19:55.192
He would not take part
in wrestling practice
for gym class...

19:55.278 --> 19:58.486
because he knows the Lord
condemns violence,
even in sport.

19:58.573 --> 20:01.906
|fyou value something,
you build a fence around it
to protect it.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.154
And that’s what
we did with James.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.328
We homeschooled him
as long as we could
to shield him from—

20:07.415 --> 20:09.326
from drugs and sex
and corruption.

20:09.417 --> 20:13.080
Is that why you were angry
about the material
she was teaching him?

20:13.171 --> 20:15.708
We are in the world,
but not ofthe world.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.006
And we need
to protect our children
from nonbelievers.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.755
Isthere anything
you wouldn’t do to protect
your son from a nonbeliever?

20:22.389 --> 20:25.051
Watch yourself.
I’m a man ofGod.

20:25.141 --> 20:29.384
Well, I like
horse racing, Manhattans,

20:29.479 --> 20:32.312
briefs, not boxers,

20:32.399 --> 20:34.390
all ofwhich makes us
equally likely to lie.

20:34.484 --> 20:39.319
- So I’ll ask you again.
- Get out ofthis house.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.454
/ ’ve been doing some research
in to james ’5 family.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.249
I spoke to an overseer
oftheir church who said
Mr. Cole has had fights...

20:53.336 --> 20:56.169
with other churchgoers
over their unholy lifestyles.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.792
Some ofthem said
he’s an extremist.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.214
There’s something going on
in that family.

21:00.301 --> 21:02.132
The police sanames
running away...

21:02.220 --> 21:04.506
from the front door
of Ms. McCartney’s house
after the murder.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.508
Maybe he was trying
to stop his father
from killing her.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.385
What’s your content analysis
ofthe mother?

21:08.476 --> 21:10.432
She was definitely
concealing something.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.057
When I asked her about
Ms. McCartney, she stopped
using contractions...

21:13.148 --> 21:15.059
and started referring to her
as “that woman.”

21:15.150 --> 21:18.563
As in, “I did not have
sexual relations with
that woman— Ms. Lewinsky”?

21:18.653 --> 21:22.612
Distancing language.
She knew something about her
she didn’t want to say.

21:22.699 --> 21:26.487
We need to look at the polygraph
testJames failed. I want to
see what questions he spiked on.

21:26.578 --> 21:29.945
Have I mentioned that
your office looks like
it belongs to a serial killer?

21:30.039 --> 21:33.702
- Several times.
- PD. is running background
checks on both the parents...

21:33.793 --> 21:36.375
and trying to confirm
their whereabouts
the night ofthe murder.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.296
As for the girl
who was so anxious,
Jacquelin Mathis,

21:39.382 --> 21:41.418
no connection toJames Cole
outside of school.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.465
But I do know why
she might’ve been anxious.

21:43.553 --> 21:47.262
- The school nurse insinuated
thatJacquelin is pregnant.
- Pregnant?

21:47.348 --> 21:50.761
Not what a father
in my shoes wants to hear.
/ gotta go.

21:50.852 --> 21:53.969
I have Emily,
and her boyfriend’s
coming over.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.520
You worry too much.
You do. You worry.

21:56.608 --> 21:59.190
You’re a worrier.
You don’t even know ifthey
talked about having sex.

21:59.319 --> 22:01.731
Well, he’s taking her
to a fancy restaurant.
Emily’s a smart girl.

22:01.863 --> 22:04.275
You have to trust her.
Well, her mother’s
a smart girl too.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.526
And I trusted her.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.451
Well, I think
Roger’s a loser.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.448
But if Mom wants
to be with a loser—

22:11.539 --> 22:13.450
You don’t have
to say that for me.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.532
No, I’m saying it
’cause he’s a loser.

22:15.627 --> 22:19.996
I have the utmost respect
for anyone your mother
cares for, and so should you.

22:20.089 --> 22:23.081
Admit it.
You’re thinking, “What a loser.”
I saw your eyes do the thing.

22:24.802 --> 22:27.760
[Doorbell Rings]
Uh, Dan’s early.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.304
Yeah, and about that.

22:30.391 --> 22:33.224
I know your mother’s
out of town, and you got
the keys, and Dan has a car.

22:33.311 --> 22:37.975
No. We’re not doing this.
Youjust go let Dan in
while I finish getting ready.

22:38.066 --> 22:41.058
And you better not
do some covert
scientific technique...

22:41.152 --> 22:45.191
to find out
what we’re doing
or not doing tonight.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.397
Promise.

22:50.161 --> 22:52.117
No covert science.
I promise.

22:53.706 --> 22:57.164
- Hi, Dan.
- Hi, Dr. Lightman.

22:57.252 --> 23:01.120
Are you trying to have sex
with my daughter tonight?

23:06.344 --> 23:10.838
We appreciate your time.
Congressman Weil, have you ever
been to a club called Centurian?

23:12.642 --> 23:16.260
Marshall, what is this really about?
I’m a five-term US. Congressman.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.308
I’d appreciate—
Answer the question,
Zeb.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.482
I’ve never heard of it.
Why?

23:22.569 --> 23:25.527
It’s been alleged
that you go to this club
on Friday nights.

23:25.613 --> 23:28.480
[Continues 0n Speaker]
Tell me how you spent
last Friday evening.

23:28.575 --> 23:32.409
I went for a swim
at the congressional gym.

23:32.495 --> 23:35.077
Then I went home
to catch up on
some committee reading.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.871
Go on.

23:37.959 --> 23:41.247
I had dinner alone
before leaving for an event
at the Smithsonian.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.589
Got it.
Nowjust tell it
to me backwards.

23:43.673 --> 23:47.086
- What?
- Start at the end of the night
and work backwards.

23:47.176 --> 23:50.964
[Nervous Chuckle]

23:51.055 --> 23:55.845
Before the event
at the Smithsonian,
l, uh—

23:55.935 --> 23:58.176

his ass off.

24:07.071 --> 24:10.484

When you’re lying, it’s hard
to tell a story backwards...

because there’s
no real memory
ofwhat happened.

a lot more shameful?

or underage girls?

a sexual relationship between
James and Ms. McCartney?

You’re afraid for your son, Mrs. Cole.
And when we experience fear,

we try to exercise
whatever control we can,
even i'fi't makes things worse.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.821
That’s why you lied
to us before.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.992
It may help you feel better,
but it’s not helping your son.

toJames about sex?

27:23.100 --> 27:26.228
I talked with him about
the urges that young men feel.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.223

28:07.728 --> 28:10.936
I understand why.

28:12.775 --> 28:17.269
Ms. McCartney didn’t make you feel anger.
She made you feel temptation.

28:18.948 --> 28:21.314
She was a beautiful woman.

28:21.409 --> 28:24.993
And for the ﬁrst time
in your life,

you went back to her house to spy on her.

still a preponderance
of evidence against him.

Oh, he lied when he said
he’d never been in
Ms. McCartney’s house before.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.374

go a long way toward
proving premeditation.

to reconnect with an adoptee.

37:40.926 --> 37:44.089
The adopted name you listed
was Brenda MelissaJohnson.

make her Melissa ’s age now

37:58.652 --> 38:01.860
I was ajunior
in college at UA.

38:01.947 --> 38:05.405
And I was seeing a young woman
who was a freshman at
the women’s college in Marion.

38:05.492 --> 38:08.234
She got pregnant

38:08.328 --> 38:12.571
We agreed to
a closed adoption.
We both moved on.

38:14.084 --> 38:16.996
But I never stopped
thinking about it.

38:18.630 --> 38:22.964
A couple ofyears ago,
I registered to be found.
Nothing came of it.

38:24.887 --> 38:27.879
So I hired a private investigator.

38:27.973 --> 38:31.591
Does Melissa— Brenda—
know you’re her father?

38:31.685 --> 38:34.643
No.

38:34.730 --> 38:37.267
I didn’t want to force her
to confront an answer...

38:37.357 --> 38:40.975
she clearly wasn’t looking for.

38:41.069 --> 38:44.197
But when I found out
she was working at that club,
I had to do something.

38:44.281 --> 38:48.194
So I went—
Started getting to know her,
gave her money.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.866
Tried to get her to quit.

38:49.953 --> 38:52.205
We can tell the chairman
and the press.

38:52.289 --> 38:53.825
Please, no.

38:53.916 --> 38:55.531
No?

38:55.626 --> 38:59.995
I am close to getting
Brenda to make a change.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.830

who she really is,

39:02.925 --> 39:06.759
she Will spend
the rest of her life
being known...

39:06.845 --> 39:09.757
as the congressman’s
whore daughter.

39:14.228 --> 39:16.970
I’ve already
betrayed her once.

Ms. McCartney...

you fought with her.
I didn’t!

40:15.747 --> 40:17.658

I know you didn’t.
But you know who did.

about the argument.

Ms. McCartney saw us...

42:25.377 --> 42:27.743
parked in my car,
that was at school—

42:27.838 --> 42:31.376
We didn’t—
We didn’t know,
but she saw us.

42:31.466 --> 42:34.674
And then later that day,
she came up to me in the

all worried about me when—

42:37.222 --> 42:39.133
I mean, I was the one
who went after him.

42:39.224 --> 42:41.931
And then you argued
about turning him in?

42:42.018 --> 42:45.351
I begged her not to.
He hadn’t done anything wrong.

She didn ’t listen.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.228
She said she was gonna
turn him in.

And then, you know,

would be okay, and
that he would talk to her.
