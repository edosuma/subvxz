IT'S THE FIRST DAY

00:09.259 --> 00:14.388
RABBIT SEASON.
DUCK SEASON.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.644
WELL, RED, YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN HUNTING IN AGES.

00:20.812 --> 00:26.191
NOT SINCE THE ACCIDENT.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.027
WHAT ACCIDENT?

00:28.194 --> 00:29.570
THE REALLY
TERRIBLE ACCIDENT

00:29.738 --> 00:32.406
THAT'S NONE

00:35.035 --> 00:36.243
YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU GO?

00:36.411 --> 00:38.996
IT MIGHT BE FUN. GET OUT OF
THE HOUSE, GET SOME FRESH AIR,

00:39.164 --> 00:42.166
MAYBE GET OUT OF
YOUR LOUSY DAMN MOOD.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.169

BUT WE JUST
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.633
OH, YES WE CAN.
I WILL PACK YOU SOME FOOD,

00:51.801 --> 00:55.721
AND A NICE BOX OF BULLETS,
AND YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.517
DAD, YOU COULD USE
THE PINCIOTTIS' CABIN.

01:00.685 --> 01:02.394
BOB HAS A CABIN?

01:02.562 --> 01:05.522
WELL, ISN'T THAT
JUST THE CAT'S ASS.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.818
OH, BOO-HOO,
THE WORLD'S UNFAIR.

01:09.986 --> 01:12.821
NOW JUST ASK BOB IF YOU
CAN BORROW HIS CABIN.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.158
OKAY, WE'LL GO.
JUST US GUYS.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.163
UH, MOM?

01:21.331 --> 01:22.623
WELL, YOU SHOULD GO.
YOU DON'T SPEND

01:22.791 --> 01:24.500
NEARLY ENOUGH TIME
WITH YOUR FATHER.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.086
THAT'S BECAUSE
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.758
YES, HE DOES LIKE YOU.
AND THAT'S NO EXCUSE.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.761
WELL, I DON'T
HAVE A GUN.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.139
MY MOM TOOK IT
WHEN SHE LEFT.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.518
WELL, YOU CAN SHARE.
YOU KNOW,

01:42.685 --> 01:44.228
THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT A GUN

01:44.395 --> 01:46.605
THAT JUST MAKES YOU
WANT TO SHARE.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.233
OKAY, FINE, MOM.
I'LL GO WITH DAD,

01:49.400 --> 01:51.151
BUT IF I DON'T
COME BACK,

AND I'LL HAVE ONE CARD.

11:39.323 --> 11:42.909
OH, IT'S A 5.
JACKIE, DID YOU WANT THIS?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.038
YOU GAVE HER A 5?

11:47.206 --> 11:49.833
I THOUGHT
WE WERE FRIENDS.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.042
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:51.210 --> 11:52.419
EVERYBODY JUST SHOW
YOUR CARDS.

11:52.586 --> 11:53.545
OKAY, DID I WIN?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.004
DID I WIN?
DID I WIN?

11:55.172 --> 11:56.423
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.841
OH. WELL,
I DON'T CARE.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.426
I DON'T WORK,
SO MONEY DOESN'T

11:59.593 --> 12:01.886
REALLY MEAN
ANYTHING TO ME.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.681
OH, HOW NICE FOR YOU.
HA HA.

12:06.308 --> 12:11.146
[MUSIC]

12:14.108 --> 12:15.442
HEY, DAD. I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU,

12:15.609 --> 12:19.195
BUT I'M KIND OF
FROZEN TO THE BLIND.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.740
RIGHT IN
THE PANTS AREA.

12:21.907 --> 12:25.452
SHH. JEEZ, YOU HAVE DONE
NOTHING BUT COMPLAIN

12:25.619 --> 12:28.496
SINCE WE GOT HERE.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.290
YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING
THAT THIS TRIP

12:30.458 --> 12:32.292
WOULD BE BETTER
THAN THE LAST,

12:32.460 --> 12:35.378
WHERE YOU CRIED ABOUT
EVERY STUPID THING.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.633
I WAS 6.

12:40.801 --> 12:45.263
AND YOU MADE ME
TOUCH A DEAD RABBIT.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.434
I JUST THOUGHT THAT
IF YOU TOUCHED IT,

12:49.602 --> 12:52.479
YOU MIGHT NOT
BE AFRAID OF IT.

12:52.646 --> 12:56.107
WELL, THANK YOU,
DR. SPOCK.

12:56.817 --> 13:00.779
MAKING NOISE IS NOT
THE WAY TO BAG A DEER.

13:02.823 --> 13:06.284
I HAD NIGHTMARES
FOR A MONTH.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.872
BIG, DEAD,
RABBIT NIGHTMARES.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.877
OH, MAN. WE GOT ONE.
HE IS HUGE.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.922
WHERE?
I DON'T SEE IT.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.423
IT'S ABOUT
A QUARTER CLICK

13:20.591 --> 13:21.591
SOUTH OF
THE CLEARING.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.885
WHAT IS A CLICK?

13:24.053 --> 13:25.428
AND WHICH WAY
IS SOUTH?

13:25.596 --> 13:26.805
OH NO, WAIT,
OKAY, I SEE HIM.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.432
YEAH. OH, YOU'RE RIGHT, DAD.
HE IS HUGE.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.895
YOU'RE NOT KIDDING.
I'D SAY HE'S A 10-POINTER.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.942
WHAT?

13:39.610 --> 13:42.904
I WAS JUST THINKING.
YOU TAKE THE SHOT.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.406
NO WAY. YOU ALWAYS
TALK ABOUT

13:45.574 --> 13:46.908
GETTING A BUCK.
YOU DO IT.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.243
NO, DAMN IT. NOW
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.453
NOW TAKE THE SHOT.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.374
COME ON. HURRY UP.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.753
OH, AND DON'T
SHOOT HIM IN THE FACE.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.178
[GUN FIRES]

14:11.725 --> 14:14.936
HOLY COW,
LOOK AT HIM GO.

14:18.899 --> 14:21.734
MAN, YOU REALLY STINK.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.153
I TOLD YOU
TO TAKE THE SHOT.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.405
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE NICE

14:25.573 --> 14:27.031
FOR YOU TO GET A DEER.
I MEAN,

14:27.199 --> 14:28.825
GOD KNOWS, I'D LOVE
TO GET ONE.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.286
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE
TAKEN THE SHOT.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.162
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

14:33.330 --> 14:35.415
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS
SO DAMN NERVOUS?

14:35.583 --> 14:36.749
OH, HMM,
I DON'T KNOW.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.042
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN

14:38.210 --> 14:40.086
YELLING AT ME
FOR 17 YEARS?

14:41.297 --> 14:43.590
OH, I HAVE NOT. OH, GOD,
HE WAS RIGHT THERE.

14:43.757 --> 14:48.428
I COULD HAVE HIT HIM
WITH A ROCK.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.180
YEP, THAT'S
A DAMN SHAME.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.933
SO ARE YOU READY
TO HEAD BACK?

14:54.101 --> 14:56.227
NO, I SURE AS HELL
AM NOT READY TO HEAD BACK.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.479
YOU WANT TO GO BACK?
YOU GO BACK.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.111
SO.
[CLEARS THROAT]

15:05.279 --> 15:07.864
HEY, DAD. HOW ABOUT
A WAR STORY?

15:08.782 --> 15:13.745
YEAH, OKAY. DID I EVER
TELL YOU ABOUT THE TIME

15:13.913 --> 15:17.790
I DIDN'T MISS
THAT NORTH KOREAN?

15:24.673 --> 15:27.467
FULL HOUSE.
JACKS OVER 10s.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.219
MOM WINS AGAIN.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.638
[LAUGHS]

15:31.805 --> 15:34.515
WELL THIS IS FUN,
ISN'T THIS FUN?

15:35.768 --> 15:37.936
IT WAS FUN TILL LAURIE
STARTED DEALING.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.938
HEY, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

15:40.856 --> 15:42.273
OH, MY GOSH. I THINK
MRS. PINCIOTTI IS SAYING

15:42.441 --> 15:43.566
THAT LAURIE'S CHEATING.

15:43.734 --> 15:44.859
NO, SHE'S NOT.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.028
WAIT. YES I AM.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.739
MY DAUGHTER
DOES NOT CHEAT.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.908
COME ON, DONNA. WE'RE
STORMING OUT OF HERE.

15:52.576 --> 15:53.785
OKAY, SEE YA.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.328
HOLD ON.
I'LL STORM WITH YOU.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.789
THANK YOU FOR A LOVELY
AFTERNOON, MRS. FORMAN.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.297
LAURIE, WERE YOU CHEATING?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.383
YOU CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.677
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.220
OKAY, WELL,
IF YOU WEREN'T

16:12.388 --> 16:13.554
SUCH A CRAPPY
CARD PLAYER,

16:13.722 --> 16:15.640
THEN I WOULDN'T
HAVE HAD TO CHEAT.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.433
AND YOU WERE GONNA LOSE
ALL YOUR MAD MONEY,

16:17.601 --> 16:19.811
AND MIDGE BUGS ME.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.398
YOU WERE CHEATING
SO I WOULD WIN.

16:23.565 --> 16:26.234
DUH. I WANTED YOU
TO HAVE A LITTLE FUN.

16:26.402 --> 16:30.822
WELL GOSH,
THAT'S SWEET.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.285
YEAH.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.913
I LOVE YOU, MOMMY.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.505
I JUST KNOW I WOULDN'T
HAVE MISSED HIM.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.135
NOT WHEN HE WAS
THAT CLOSE. NO WAY.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.973
HERE.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.058
DAD, YOU SEE THE CAN
BY THAT CLEARING?

16:59.226 --> 17:01.310
YEAH.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.314
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.735
DAD, I KNOW
HOW TO SHOOT.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.571
DON'T YOU REMEMBER MY
TAXI DRIVER PHASE?

17:14.616 --> 17:17.368
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT
TO KILL HIM.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.871
I MISSED ON PURPOSE.

17:20.497 --> 17:22.081
WELL, I CAN
RESPECT THAT MORE

17:22.249 --> 17:24.167
THAN YOU BEING
A CRAPPY SHOT.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.127
WHAT?

17:26.295 --> 17:27.545
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.547
WHY DO YOU THINK?

17:30.299 --> 17:32.717
YOU REALLY THINK I'VE BEEN
YELLING AT YOU FOR 17 YEARS?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.720
NO.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.472
YOU WERE PROBABLY OKAY
WITH ME AS AN INFANT.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.558
I JUST CAN'T REMEMBER.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.186
BOY, IT WAS
RIGHT AROUND 13

17:43.353 --> 17:48.399
WHEN YOU STARTED GETTING A
LITTLE LIPPY. AND TWITCHY.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.193
WELL, YOU KNOW,
LIPPY AND TWITCHY

17:50.360 --> 17:52.278
TEND TO WALK
HAND-IN-HAND, SO.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.614
SEE?
NOW THAT'S LIPPY.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.078

SAY TO ME, YOU JUST SAY IT.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.375
NO, I'M SERIOUS HERE.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.003
JUST FOR A SECOND, PRETEND
THAT I'M NOT YOUR DAD.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.881
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT
YOU REALLY THINK OF ME.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.555
HOW ABOUT
LET'S DO THIS

18:19.723 --> 18:22.266
WHEN YOU
DON'T HAVE A GUN?

18:22.434 --> 18:26.479
HOW ABOUT YOU DO WHAT THE GUY
WITH THE GUN TELLS YOU TO DO?

18:28.816 --> 18:31.317
OKAY.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.528

YOU'RE ANGRY

BECAUSE LIFE
DIDN'T TURN OUT

18:34.613 --> 18:36.280
EXACTLY THE WAY
YOU WANTED IT TO,

18:36.448 --> 18:39.367
AND UH, MAYBE YOU THINK
IF YOU YELL AT ME,

18:39.535 --> 18:41.744
I WON'T LET LIFE
PUSH ME AROUND, TOO.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.750
YOU CAME UP WITH THAT
ANSWER AWFUL FAST.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.508
WELL.

MAYBE YOU'LL BE OKAY.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.184
OH, MY GOD.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.648
OH, LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S MAGNIFICENT.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.653
HE'S THE KING
OF THE FOREST.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.781
JUST LIKE
BAMBI'S DAD.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.206
HE'S BEAUTIFUL.
[GUN FIRES]

19:28.125 --> 19:31.252

BEAUTIFUL, TOO.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.216
OH, UH, JUST FOR
THE RECORD, ERIC.

19:37.384 --> 19:40.428
I'M THE KING OF THE FOREST.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.650
WAY TO GO, DAD. YOU
FINALLY GOT YOUR BUCK.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.694
I WISH IT WAS MINE,

19:56.862 --> 19:58.196
BUT SOMEBODY
TOOK MY GUN

19:58.363 --> 20:00.990
'CAUSE HE SENSED WHAT
A GREAT HUNTER I AM.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.117
KELSO, IF WE LET YOU
KEEP YOUR GUN,

20:03.285 --> 20:06.204
FEZ WOULD BE THE ONE STRAPPED
ON THAT HOOD RIGHT NOW.

20:12.002 --> 20:16.255
HEY, RED. SO, UH, ABOUT
THAT ACCIDENT, HUH?

20:16.965 --> 20:19.884
AH, YEAH. WELL, IT
WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.053
I WAS OUT, UH,
HUNTING WITH FRANK.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.430
HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND
OF MINE, A GOOD GUY.

20:24.598 --> 20:27.767
KIND OF A DUMB-ASS
LIKE KELSO HERE.

20:29.853 --> 20:32.104
SO ANYWAY, FRANK
HAD SHOT THIS DEER,

20:32.272 --> 20:33.648
AND HE WAS
REAL HAPPY,

20:33.815 --> 20:35.066
AND HE'D
HAD A FEW BEERS

20:35.234 --> 20:37.610
SO HE WAS
DANCING AROUND,

20:37.778 --> 20:39.320
AND IT WAS ALL
REAL FUN,

20:39.488 --> 20:42.782
AND THEN HE LEANS OVER
TO KISS THE DEER,

20:42.950 --> 20:44.450
ONLY THE DEER'S
NOT DEAD YET,

20:44.618 --> 20:47.245
AND IT KICKS HIM
RIGHT IN THE NECK.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.956
AND IT KILLED HIM.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.839
THE DEER IS STARING
AT MY SOUL.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.592
PUT SOME SUNGLASSES
ON IT.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.388
WELL, THIS IS JUST
DELICIOUS.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.349
[SPITS]

21:08.684 --> 21:10.101
SORRY ABOUT
THE BUCK SHOT.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.560
OH, I DON'T MIND.
I MEAN,

21:11.728 --> 21:12.937
THERE'S USUALLY SOME
MYSTERY GRISTLE IN MEAT.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.023
AT LEAST WE KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.443
I LIKE IT BETTER WHEN
YOU FISH, DADDY.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.612
IT WAS JERKING AROUND,
SO, UH, ERIC SHOT IT

21:21.780 --> 21:23.698
WITH THE SHOTGUN.

21:23.865 --> 21:27.785
WELL, I HAD TO.
IT WAS SCREAMING.

21:36.211 --> 21:40.047
I KILLED
A RACCOON ONCE.

21:40.215 --> 21:43.551
HIT HIM WITH
MY UNCLE'S CAR.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.762
SO BAD.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.516

SETTLE DOWN, KILLER.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.852

LIKE WE'RE ALL

21:53.020 --> 21:55.438
A BUNCH
OF REAL KILLERS.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.112
OH, GOOD GOD,
CRACK A WINDOW.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.656
THAT
IS UNPLEASANT.
