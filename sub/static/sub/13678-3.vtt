WEBVTT

00:02.504 --> 00:05.298
You guys are acting like
we're walking towards
doomsday here.

00:05.382 --> 00:07.592
It does say,
"End of the world party."

00:09.803 --> 00:11.429
He's dead.
Did anyone see you?

00:11.513 --> 00:12.931
We started a movement!

00:13.014 --> 00:14.557
Get back on a terminal now!

00:14.641 --> 00:15.725
We need to find
someone who can do

00:15.809 --> 00:17.644
that migration thing
he keep talking about.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.729
You play chess?
I've been looking for
a good adversary.

00:19.813 --> 00:23.191
Sharon, how do you not
blow your brains out
being married to him?

00:23.274 --> 00:24.317
Do you want to
go have a drink?

00:24.401 --> 00:25.860
We're not to be
seen together.

00:25.944 --> 00:27.737
You've been parked in the lot
for the past two days.

00:27.821 --> 00:28.905
How long have you
been asleep?

00:28.988 --> 00:30.573
<i>There she is,
the ray of sunshine</i>

00:30.657 --> 00:32.325
<i>in the dark void
of my existence.</i>

00:32.409 --> 00:34.828
<i>...Washington Township
toxic waste scandal.</i>

00:34.911 --> 00:37.330
You want to take Internet
gossip to federal court

00:37.414 --> 00:39.290
<i>and throw it at the
strongest conglomerate</i>

00:39.374 --> 00:41.209
in the history
of civilization?

00:41.292 --> 00:44.587
Jim and Saul
were both in
the room with Colby,

00:44.671 --> 00:47.215
covering up the leak
in your hometown.

00:47.298 --> 00:49.175
<i>Their lives will
be destroyed.</i>

00:49.592 --> 00:54.431
<i>But the minute you remove
emotion from this,</i>

00:54.597 --> 00:56.057
<i>you'll do just fine.</i>

01:32.510 --> 01:33.595
Trick or treat?

01:35.722 --> 01:38.308
Found it in a 99È¼ shop
in Chinatown.

01:38.975 --> 01:42.270
I didn't know they
actually made a mask
from that movie. Did you?

01:44.147 --> 01:46.149
When'd you get
back to the city?

01:48.401 --> 01:50.195
Well, it's Halloween.

01:50.653 --> 01:54.157
Seeing as though
that used to be our thing,
I thought I'd hit you up.

01:55.992 --> 01:58.745
"Great, Darlene,
I haven't seen you
in a long time, either.

01:58.828 --> 02:00.747
"I'd love to hang out."

02:02.832 --> 02:06.669
Next time, you
should call first.
I'm going out.

02:06.753 --> 02:10.006
Come on.
You don't go out.

02:12.342 --> 02:14.260
I don't mean that
in a cunty way.

02:14.344 --> 02:17.972
I just mean,
you know, you're you.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.560
Look, if this is you
needing a place to stay,

02:22.644 --> 02:23.895
then you can
crash on the couch.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.438
Init 1.

02:29.192 --> 02:32.237
I wouldn't say that
if I wasn't being serious.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.240
Please.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.325
Hang out with
me tonight.

02:38.827 --> 02:40.703
For real. I need this.

02:55.385 --> 02:57.178
<i>Do you have to wear
that grody, old mask?</i>

02:57.262 --> 02:58.680
<i>It's totally notchy.</i>

02:58.763 --> 03:02.308
<i>It's Father's.
He wore it on his yacht
five New Year's ago.</i>

03:02.392 --> 03:04.143
<i>We were
a mile off Catalina.</i>

03:04.227 --> 03:05.270
<i>Duh.</i>

03:05.353 --> 03:07.188
<i>It was the night
Uncle Conrad threw
himself overboard.</i>

03:07.272 --> 03:09.858
<i>All because Dad
got the business.</i>

03:09.941 --> 03:12.777
I mean, clearly
what the film is doing
is debunking the notion

03:12.902 --> 03:15.864
that American society
is classless.

03:15.947 --> 03:18.491
Meritocracy my ass.

03:18.575 --> 03:20.994
Long live the oligarchy!

03:21.119 --> 03:22.161
<i>Whatever,</i>

03:22.245 --> 03:23.705
<i>can you
just take the mask off?
It's freaking me out.</i>

03:23.788 --> 03:25.331
God.

03:25.415 --> 03:27.876
It's like us
and the three seeders
are the only idiots

03:27.959 --> 03:30.420
to actually watch
this thing growing up.

03:31.296 --> 03:35.508
This is definitely
the root of all of our
psychological dysfunction.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.927
<i>Fashionably late.
Screw that.
I hate our friends.</i>

03:40.430 --> 03:42.307
You still having them?

03:44.434 --> 03:47.770
Why is that always
your go-to with me?

03:47.854 --> 03:50.189
I mean, trust me,
in this day and age,

03:50.315 --> 03:52.650
it's sicker not
having panic attacks.

03:53.026 --> 03:56.154
Since when did pretending
everything's okay

03:56.237 --> 03:58.239
suddenly become
the almighty norm?

04:06.789 --> 04:07.874
Jesus.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.293
Okay, I don't
normally say this,

04:10.418 --> 04:12.253
but I have got to
Instagram this.

04:14.130 --> 04:16.716
People need to know
this movie exists.

04:25.058 --> 04:27.477
I'm really into
papadum these days.

04:28.353 --> 04:29.437
What about you?
You want to do Indian?

04:31.648 --> 04:34.400
I hacked Postmates' proxy
that supports the APN

04:34.484 --> 04:36.027
for my boyfriend's
cell carrier.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.403
Now it does a URL rewrite

04:37.487 --> 04:40.907
and sends every
postmates.com request
to my affiliate link,

04:40.990 --> 04:44.953
meaning, I get $10 coupons
every time
a sucker orders anything.

04:50.583 --> 04:51.960
What's your deal?

04:52.043 --> 04:55.254
That lame InfoSec gig
scared you straight?

04:55.713 --> 04:57.006
No, man.

04:58.383 --> 04:59.759
Got fired.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.432
Now I'm seeing a shrink.

05:09.769 --> 05:13.606
Hold the fuck up.
What does a shrink
have to do with this?

05:15.817 --> 05:19.070
I was on this project,
pen testing.

05:19.153 --> 05:21.864
Kept finding
holes in the system.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.493
Wasn't my fault they sucked,

05:25.576 --> 05:30.123
but it was my job
to keep hacking till
it was hacker-proof.

05:31.874 --> 05:35.378
I think it was the night
of Memorial Day weekend.

05:35.878 --> 05:39.340
Everybody wanted to go home

05:40.174 --> 05:41.551
to their parties,

05:41.634 --> 05:43.302
their clubs,

05:43.386 --> 05:45.054
their vacations.

05:48.141 --> 05:49.809
But they couldn't.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.353
Because of me.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.649
So, when they couldn't
lock down the servers,

05:56.733 --> 06:00.153
they decided to lock
down my ass instead,

06:00.236 --> 06:02.071
in the server room.

06:03.906 --> 06:07.243
After a few hours,
I fell asleep.

06:09.495 --> 06:10.872
Woke up.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.920
All the servers in the
room were destroyed.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.549
I didn't remember
doing it.

06:23.634 --> 06:28.306
Judge made me go to therapy
for anger management.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.735
Guess it's official.

06:44.781 --> 06:46.157
I'm crazy.

06:50.119 --> 06:52.080
You want to know
who's crazy?

06:52.163 --> 06:54.290
Those Wall Street psychos.

06:55.708 --> 06:58.211
Okay? You'll find
something better.

06:59.128 --> 07:03.091
Angela's trying
to hook me up
with a job at Allsafe.

07:08.638 --> 07:10.306
You see Mom?

07:11.766 --> 07:14.685
Not really. You?

07:15.853 --> 07:17.563
Fuck no.

07:17.647 --> 07:20.817
She still shits on Dad
every time I talk to her.

07:29.242 --> 07:31.786
I wish I remembered
him better.

07:38.751 --> 07:40.670
You want to see something?

07:57.186 --> 07:58.604
Holy shit.

07:59.939 --> 08:01.315
Is this...

08:04.861 --> 08:06.195
Put it on.

08:08.406 --> 08:09.740
Put it on.

08:23.713 --> 08:24.839
Oh, my God, okay, wait.

08:28.718 --> 08:30.386
Put this on, too.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.140
Why?

08:34.265 --> 08:35.600
Because I asked you to.

09:15.598 --> 09:18.768
Maybe I should take
the job at Allsafe.

09:20.353 --> 09:22.438
I could be a Trojan horse.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.652
Be a good way
to take them down.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.113
Who?

09:36.911 --> 09:38.287
Evil Corp.

09:41.249 --> 09:42.333
Okay.

09:46.545 --> 09:49.757
I can't tell
if you're joking
behind that mask.

09:54.136 --> 09:59.183
With the right access,
install the right malware,

10:02.770 --> 10:05.815
trash their backups,

10:05.898 --> 10:08.276
we could corrupt
all their data.

10:09.652 --> 10:12.405
I bet it wouldn't
even be that hard.

10:12.488 --> 10:13.906
No.

10:13.990 --> 10:19.078
No, the hard part
would be after,
during the fallout.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.247
That's the key.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.082
The follow through.

10:23.165 --> 10:28.004
They'd have
an opportunity to reset,
rebuild their database.

10:28.087 --> 10:29.714
We couldn't let them.

10:30.339 --> 10:33.426
It'd be tempting to
lay off them afterwards,

10:33.551 --> 10:36.637
but that's when you
have to go in for more.

10:36.721 --> 10:38.514
The public's
confidence in them

10:38.639 --> 10:40.391
would have to be
completely destroyed

10:40.474 --> 10:42.977
in order to really
finish them off.

10:48.357 --> 10:50.985
That's the only way
it would work.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.865
Dude, you're
freaking me out.

10:58.868 --> 11:01.412
I mean, don't get me wrong.
Taking them down would...

11:01.495 --> 11:02.872
Change the world.

11:09.211 --> 11:13.174
Is this something
you've actually
thought about?

11:37.740 --> 11:39.075
You there?

13:34.607 --> 13:35.733
God.

13:37.318 --> 13:40.321
I will never understand
why you did this.

13:41.489 --> 13:44.700
<i>Asking
for help was never
Darlene's strong suit.</i>

13:45.534 --> 13:47.912
<i>But then again,
is it anyone's?</i>

13:47.995 --> 13:50.122
<i>An admission of weakness.</i>

13:50.206 --> 13:52.666
<i>But you can't avoid
the simple truth.</i>

13:52.750 --> 13:56.587
<i>The only way to
patch a vulnerability
is by exposing it first.</i>

13:56.670 --> 13:59.131
It's good for me here.

13:59.215 --> 14:01.550
Better than
back at my place.

14:03.427 --> 14:04.803
It's cool.

14:04.887 --> 14:08.849
I mean, I don't get it,
but I don't have to.

14:08.933 --> 14:11.936
<i>The flip side being
that exposing a vulnerability</i>

14:12.019 --> 14:14.396
<i>leaves you open
for an exploit.</i>

14:16.565 --> 14:18.776
I have to tell
you something.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.611
It's pretty fucking
metal though,

14:20.694 --> 14:23.489
and I don't know
if you're gonna
be able to deal

14:23.572 --> 14:25.491
after the whole
Gideon thing.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.662
I know what you've
been doing, Darlene.

14:30.329 --> 14:31.580
I see the news.

14:33.374 --> 14:35.000
That's not even
the half of it.

14:35.084 --> 14:36.585
You need to stop.

14:37.086 --> 14:39.046
It's too dangerous.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.424
Don't give me that.

14:42.508 --> 14:44.301
The things we're
doing, Elliot,

14:44.385 --> 14:46.720
the things I'm doing
to complete our mission,

14:46.804 --> 14:48.764
you'd be proud
if you only knew.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.517
We have something big planned
for the bailout vote in D.C.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.685
No.

14:54.019 --> 14:55.104
No more.

14:57.648 --> 15:01.443
We're on the other side
of something
we never signed up for.

15:03.821 --> 15:05.573
My boss was killed.

15:06.282 --> 15:11.120
I mean,
what did you guys expect
was gonna happen, exactly?

15:11.203 --> 15:13.539
You thought
everything was gonna
be hunky-fucking-dory?

15:13.622 --> 15:15.249
They'd go quietly
into the night?

15:16.250 --> 15:19.503
You said it yourself
before we even started.

15:19.712 --> 15:21.547
The hard part
would be after,

15:21.630 --> 15:23.716
not the during or before.

15:29.805 --> 15:31.432
That wasn't me.

15:34.268 --> 15:35.894
That was him.

15:41.358 --> 15:43.944
Well, then maybe
I need him right now,

15:45.613 --> 15:49.783
because what I'm seeing
in front of me isn't helping.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.829
<i>She's not
telling me something.</i>

15:54.538 --> 15:58.792
<i>She wants my help,
but she's not being
honest about what.</i>

15:58.876 --> 16:01.086
<i>This is what she does.</i>

16:01.170 --> 16:03.964
I mean, the things
we're doing, Elliot...

16:04.048 --> 16:06.008
<i>This is her default.</i>

16:12.514 --> 16:15.267
All right, I'm gonna show you
something in here first.

16:18.354 --> 16:19.438
Found it kind of curious

16:19.521 --> 16:20.981
he only printed out
a few pages

16:21.065 --> 16:23.025
of the FBI roster.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.985
Turned out there was
a name on each page

16:25.069 --> 16:27.613
from the New York
office, including me.

16:27.696 --> 16:30.741
Common thread among them
was that we all
interviewed Gideon Goddard.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.785
Still don't know
what it means.

16:35.371 --> 16:37.331
They were definitely
stealing power.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.668
They found a cable running
from a municipal power source.

16:40.751 --> 16:43.128
We're still looking
into Internet.

16:49.385 --> 16:51.178
The whole party
was on social media.

16:54.098 --> 16:56.266
You really like
this place for our guys?

16:56.850 --> 16:58.977
An arcade with the
goddamn sign outside?

16:59.061 --> 17:03.148
They're hackers. Brazen.
They believe in
hiding in plain sight.

17:04.066 --> 17:07.736
And this is just too stupid.

17:07.820 --> 17:08.862
What does that
say about us, then,

17:08.987 --> 17:10.030
that we're just
now finding it?

17:13.409 --> 17:15.494
We're bringing in
all the people
from these photos,

17:15.577 --> 17:17.871
crosschecking
all social media,
Facebook, Twitter.

17:17.955 --> 17:19.581
So, they threw
a party. So what?

17:20.082 --> 17:23.293
Everyone threw one of
these end-of-the-world
parties that night.

17:23.377 --> 17:24.753
What about the flyer?

17:24.837 --> 17:27.005
We checked on
the DJ name, Mobley.

17:27.131 --> 17:29.341
Appears to be
a DJ out in Vegas.

17:29.425 --> 17:33.178
Just your average,
middle-of-the-road player.
Nobody of note.

17:33.262 --> 17:35.431
He was doing a show out there
at Caesars that night.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.683
It checks. I'm not sure
of the connection.

17:37.766 --> 17:40.018
Why don't you just
break it down for us, Dom?

17:40.102 --> 17:43.063
What hard evidence
do we actually have here?

17:48.152 --> 17:52.364
Found this tucked behind
that Mallard Murder game
over there.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.993
How do you know
no one followed you?

17:56.118 --> 17:58.287
They think
I'm in a yoga class.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.413
Trust me.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.457
He's very good at this.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.085
This is no way to live.

18:05.169 --> 18:08.714
They keep
asking me questions,
over and over.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.382
They don't stop
coming back.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.968
I promise you.
You're safe.

18:13.260 --> 18:16.054
I don't feel it.
I don't feel it.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.931
I should have
never agreed to this.

18:18.015 --> 18:21.310
Kareem, tell me what
this is really about.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.270
I've paid you well
every week.

18:23.353 --> 18:26.190
What good is that to me
if I'm dead, huh?

18:26.273 --> 18:27.900
Look what happened
to the Allsafe guy.

18:27.983 --> 18:29.485
They could kill me, too!

18:30.152 --> 18:32.321
I should have never
got mixed up with you.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.865
I should have just
came clean from the jump.

18:42.206 --> 18:45.000
My husband will return soon,
and this will all be over.

18:46.043 --> 18:49.463
Listen. I'm gonna
keep telling your
story, all right?

18:49.546 --> 18:51.381
But if shit goes down
and I get busted,

18:51.465 --> 18:52.591
I'm not gonna
get locked up.

18:52.674 --> 18:53.759
You feel me?

18:54.343 --> 18:57.429
They lowered
the daily allowance
to 50 bucks a day.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.140
That's no way to live.
I can't live like that.

19:39.263 --> 19:40.305
Speak.

19:41.056 --> 19:44.059
Ma'am, we're running
low on funds.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.980
I don't know
how much longer
we can afford.

19:48.063 --> 19:50.649
E Corp still hasn't
released your husband's
severance package.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.361
The FBI was specifically told
not to put a hold on
any of that money...

19:54.444 --> 19:56.238
It's not the FBI, ma'am.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.784
We can't afford to
keep this guy quiet.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.039
I'm done with this topic.

20:20.429 --> 20:23.765
<i>I place myself in alignment
with the things I want.</i>

20:23.849 --> 20:27.769
<i>I place myself in alignment
with the things I want.</i>

20:32.024 --> 20:34.985
<i>I dissolve all
false messages.</i>

20:35.068 --> 20:37.696
<i>I dissolve all
false messages.</i>

20:43.869 --> 20:46.455
<i>My beliefs create
my own reality.</i>

20:47.456 --> 20:50.792
<i>My beliefs create
my own reality.</i>

20:56.298 --> 20:59.468
<i>All of my dreams are
coming true right now.</i>

21:00.636 --> 21:03.639
<i>All of my dreams are
coming true right now.</i>

21:19.655 --> 21:21.198
Not gonna lie.

21:22.950 --> 21:25.327
You could use
some practice.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.133
Your move.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.223
You know the definition
of "insanity"?

21:47.099 --> 21:49.768
<i>He clearly doesn't know
who he's talking to.</i>

21:49.851 --> 21:52.312
Rather than repeating
your mistakes,

21:52.396 --> 21:54.564
you should develop
your game a bit.

21:56.108 --> 21:58.026
And you're gonna teach me?

21:58.110 --> 21:59.152
No.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.030
You are.

22:02.531 --> 22:05.033
Take the board.
Play yourself.

22:05.409 --> 22:06.743
Practice.

22:06.827 --> 22:09.037
Who knows?
You might beat yourself.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.458
What's the point of that?

22:14.751 --> 22:18.380
Because there's
something on your mind.

22:19.631 --> 22:22.926
It's been there
since I first met you.

22:23.593 --> 22:24.636
<i>What?</i>

22:24.720 --> 22:27.014
<i>Like I was behind
the biggest hack
in the world,</i>

22:27.097 --> 22:28.890
<i>which also led to
the death of my...</i>

22:28.974 --> 22:30.934
I can tell you thinking
about it right now.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.645
And it burdens you.

22:33.729 --> 22:36.189
<i>No shit,
it burdens me.</i>

22:36.273 --> 22:38.942
<i>But I'm trapped
by it, aren't I?</i>

22:41.695 --> 22:45.824
Look, I'm no Catholic,
but I do believe
in confession.

22:45.907 --> 22:49.828
I've done some
dark shit myself,

22:49.911 --> 22:56.293
and it took real cleansing
to get me through it.

22:57.586 --> 22:59.921
I can help, if you want.

23:02.591 --> 23:05.635
What you say to me
stays here.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.807
Talking doesn't
really help me.

23:12.934 --> 23:16.563
You can't keep the talking
just in your head, bro.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.941
At some point,
you got to try to
make sense of it.

23:20.984 --> 23:25.322
<i>What if I do tell him
everything about what I did?</i>

23:26.114 --> 23:29.117
<i>Krista doesn't even
know that much.</i>

23:29.201 --> 23:31.953
<i>What if I could talk
to someone about this?</i>

23:32.996 --> 23:36.374
<i>Maybe he's right.
Maybe it could help.</i>

23:36.833 --> 23:38.376
<i>Finally unburden me from...</i>

23:38.460 --> 23:39.586
You tell him anything,

23:39.669 --> 23:42.255
and I will personally find
the tallest building
in the city

23:42.339 --> 23:43.715
and swan dive off of it.

23:43.799 --> 23:45.675
Ray has a point.

23:45.801 --> 23:47.385
I can't hold this
in any longer.

23:47.469 --> 23:49.137
It's eating away at me.

23:49.221 --> 23:51.014
You confess,
he goes to the law.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.474
So what?

23:52.766 --> 23:56.895
I'm okay with
being on the hook.
I'll own it all.

23:57.395 --> 23:58.772
And maybe
it'll even stop Darlene

23:58.855 --> 24:01.066
from doing any
more crazy shit.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.235
At this rate,
she's gonna end up
just like Gideon...

24:03.318 --> 24:04.653
What do you think
the Dark Army's gonna do

24:04.778 --> 24:07.489
with the knowledge
that you're all turncoats?

24:07.572 --> 24:08.740
There's no play here.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.742
You want to
unburden yourself?
Go jerk off.

24:11.243 --> 24:15.497
This, it's a road paved with
your dead friends and family.

24:20.043 --> 24:23.296
You need that game
a lot more than I thought.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.757
<i>Jim Chutney, SVP of B.A.,</i>

24:25.841 --> 24:28.885
<i>and Saul Weinberg,
Managing Director
of Operations,</i>

24:28.969 --> 24:32.055
<i>were arrested
in broad daylight
at the E Corp offices.</i>

24:32.514 --> 24:36.059
Guys like this,
they work in long games.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.603
I gave you information
he gave me,

24:38.687 --> 24:40.897
and the next day,
you had these guys arrested,

24:40.981 --> 24:42.649
which means at every move,

24:42.732 --> 24:45.026
he has followed through
on exactly what he's offered.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.529
He's given me
everything I wanted.

24:48.405 --> 24:51.324
I have a nice apartment,
a nice job.

24:51.700 --> 24:55.162
He had no leverage
against me before,
so he created it.

24:56.288 --> 24:57.914
So, you're saying
everything he's been doing

24:57.998 --> 25:00.208
is so that he can
use it against you?

25:00.292 --> 25:03.545
What about all that
stuff you said about
them valuing you?

25:03.628 --> 25:05.380
You're the one
that thought
it was suspicious

25:05.463 --> 25:07.215
that they offered me
a job in the first place.

25:07.299 --> 25:09.885
I am giving you
an explanation.

25:09.968 --> 25:11.303
He's trying to negotiate.

25:11.386 --> 25:16.600
If he's creating leverage,
it means that he needs
something from me.

25:19.311 --> 25:21.980
The drafts of
the settlement negotiations,
did you pull them?

25:23.190 --> 25:24.566
Let's look at them together.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.693
There might be
something in there
that we're missing.

25:27.194 --> 25:28.820
I don't trust
those scam artists

25:28.945 --> 25:30.614
at E Corp's risk
management division

25:30.697 --> 25:32.490
any more than you do.
So, I can assure you,

25:32.574 --> 25:33.825
if there is
something suspicious,

25:33.909 --> 25:34.993
our attorneys would have...

25:35.076 --> 25:37.120
I'm the thing
that's missing.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.625
There's something about
me in that agreement.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.877
That's why they
haven't found it.

25:49.007 --> 25:52.219
You want to settle this thing
once and for all, hmm?

26:03.605 --> 26:04.940
One game.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.069
I'll even let you
have the first move.

26:10.820 --> 26:14.282
A game to end
all games between us.

26:16.368 --> 26:20.664
We play, and the
winner takes all.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.628
Winner takes
all of what?

26:29.923 --> 26:31.466
Us.

26:32.968 --> 26:38.473
You win, you can confess
to the JFK assassination
for all I care.

26:38.556 --> 26:41.142
I'll leave
and never come back.

26:43.979 --> 26:46.606
What would happen
if I lose?

26:47.941 --> 26:49.526
You lose,

26:50.694 --> 26:54.406
I get to be in charge
once and for all.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.492
And you?

26:59.911 --> 27:01.413
What about me?

27:04.082 --> 27:06.584
Remember the night
of the hack?

27:07.919 --> 27:09.504
Remember what
happened to you?

27:11.840 --> 27:16.344
All I remember is, I woke up
in Tyrell Wellick's car
three days later.

27:19.014 --> 27:21.850
And what happened
in those three days?

27:24.394 --> 27:26.271
I don't know.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.190
That's what.

27:32.861 --> 27:35.030
The absence of knowing.

27:38.074 --> 27:40.201
Losing time forever.

27:41.119 --> 27:44.372
A deep, black void

27:45.540 --> 27:48.626
that you will
never come back from.

27:49.502 --> 27:53.048
No thoughts,
no body, no memories.

27:53.923 --> 27:57.552
Absolute nothingness.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.599
You're serious?

28:05.060 --> 28:07.354
You think I want this,
Elliot?

28:08.730 --> 28:11.149
This futile battle
we're in?

28:11.232 --> 28:13.651
Two halves
at perpetual war?

28:16.237 --> 28:18.907
I want peace just
as much as you do.

28:21.034 --> 28:24.871
Since we can't seem to find
any common ground,

28:26.873 --> 28:28.750
let's play for it.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.714
<i>What are
you thinking about?</i>

28:36.883 --> 28:39.094
I'm thinking about
his offer.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.643
Is he the only person
you interact with?

28:48.395 --> 28:51.439
<i>Don't worry.
You're safe.</i>

28:52.399 --> 28:53.608
Yes.

28:56.403 --> 28:57.612
Elliot,

28:59.114 --> 29:00.990
do you think
I could talk to him?

29:01.324 --> 29:02.534
No.

29:03.326 --> 29:04.702
Why not?

29:05.412 --> 29:07.455
It would legitimize him.

29:11.334 --> 29:14.879
At this point,
I think we have
to accept the fact

29:14.963 --> 29:17.173
that he is a legitimate
existence in your life.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.967
That's giving him
too much power.

29:19.634 --> 29:22.262
In order for us
to figure this out,
we have to acknowledge...

29:22.345 --> 29:23.847
What do you want from me?

29:24.889 --> 29:27.308
You know everything.

29:28.726 --> 29:31.563
You want me to keep
repeating myself?

29:33.440 --> 29:36.651
You want me to tell you
that I see my dead father?

29:37.652 --> 29:39.988
That I talk to him?

29:40.071 --> 29:42.115
That sometimes I lose time?

29:42.198 --> 29:43.575
That there are gaps
in my life

29:43.658 --> 29:45.535
where I don't know
what happened?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.829
That I'm losing my mind?

29:47.912 --> 29:51.082
That I didn't even
recognize my own sister?

29:51.166 --> 29:55.044
That I don't know how
to control this thing?
I don't know how to stop it?

29:55.128 --> 29:56.171
Fine!

30:05.180 --> 30:06.347
Yeah.

30:07.807 --> 30:09.517
I acknowledge it.

30:13.188 --> 30:16.858
But let's move on to the part
where you actually help me.

30:20.195 --> 30:23.781
This game
you are agreeing to
is dangerous, Elliot.

30:25.450 --> 30:28.703
You are agreeing to destroy
a part of yourself.

30:30.121 --> 30:32.207
Win or lose.

30:32.290 --> 30:36.211
So, yes, this matters
a great deal, actually.

30:38.087 --> 30:42.342
For better or worse,
he is a part of you
that makes you you.

30:44.469 --> 30:47.388
Annihilation
is not the answer.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.225
<i>Krista's wrong.</i>

30:51.309 --> 30:54.395
<i>Annihilation is
always the answer.</i>

30:54.479 --> 30:57.023
<i>We destroy parts
of ourselves every day.</i>

30:57.440 --> 30:59.901
<i>We Photoshop our warts away.</i>

31:00.235 --> 31:02.737
<i>We edit the parts
we hate about ourselves,</i>

31:02.904 --> 31:05.406
<i>modify the parts
we think people hate.</i>

31:05.573 --> 31:10.161
<i>We curate our identity,
carve it, distill it.</i>

31:10.245 --> 31:12.163
<i>Krista's wrong.</i>

31:12.247 --> 31:14.499
<i>Annihilation is all we are.</i>

31:14.582 --> 31:17.001
I fail to see the logic.

31:17.085 --> 31:20.171
Why put all your faith in her
when we have other options?

31:20.255 --> 31:21.631
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

31:21.714 --> 31:26.844
We could blow up
the whole Western Hemisphere,

31:26.928 --> 31:28.721
but you know me,
I'm old-fashioned.

31:28.805 --> 31:30.765
I always opt
for the simpler path.

31:31.599 --> 31:34.477
<i>Occam's razor and all that.</i>

31:34.561 --> 31:37.438
Be that as it may,
it is a slower path,

31:37.522 --> 31:39.190
and time is of the essence,
Phillip.

31:39.274 --> 31:43.236
I want to remind you
that closing the plant
is not an option.

31:47.615 --> 31:51.286
And how many minutes
have you allotted
for this phone call?

31:52.579 --> 31:56.332
<i>I didn't start this game.
You did.</i>

31:57.584 --> 31:59.419
I'm being pressured to resign.

31:59.502 --> 32:02.380
Confidence in the market
is at an all-time low.

32:02.463 --> 32:03.798
And what are you up to?

32:04.215 --> 32:07.176
<i>You're not doing anything
on your end to help.</i>

32:07.260 --> 32:08.636
<i>I'm handling this.</i>

32:09.387 --> 32:11.639
Just like I said I would.

32:12.056 --> 32:14.767
Have you spoken
to the administration?

32:15.476 --> 32:18.896
Mmm. We're not there yet.
President isn't
desperate enough.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.274
<i>We need the pressure
to cook a little more.</i>

32:21.357 --> 32:25.069
You assured me
that the UN vote
would be in full swing.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.363
<i>You're the time master.</i>

32:28.031 --> 32:32.702
You should know
that while Rome
may have burned in a day,

32:32.785 --> 32:34.746
it wasn't built in one.

32:35.747 --> 32:41.919
<i>This will take time,
painful as that
is for you to hear.</i>

32:43.463 --> 32:47.717
Looks like he's opting
for his Ecoin strategy.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.304
He's such a fussy cat.

32:52.180 --> 32:56.225
We need to look into
our stage two schedule.

32:57.685 --> 32:59.395
Six months.

32:59.604 --> 33:00.647
Minimum.

33:01.606 --> 33:04.359
That will require
much patience.

33:05.276 --> 33:07.820
And you know how much
I detest that.

33:11.658 --> 33:12.992
Show me.

33:18.414 --> 33:22.752
Look into it.
We need to know what
they know.

33:31.886 --> 33:33.054
Which one do you like?

33:34.764 --> 33:35.807
The right one.

33:39.727 --> 33:42.605
What would I do
without you?

34:15.847 --> 34:17.557
Hello, Scott.

34:18.808 --> 34:21.102
Why the fuck
are you in my home?

34:23.938 --> 34:26.107
Your housekeeper let me in.

34:31.821 --> 34:34.782
There seems to be a problem
with my husband's
severance package.

34:37.243 --> 34:39.871
That sounds like
an issue for HR.

34:40.246 --> 34:43.541
Yes. I've spoken
to them already.

34:43.624 --> 34:46.919
Several times, in fact.
They claim
they can't release it yet.

34:49.046 --> 34:52.300
Yeah, there seems to be
a problem for me, too.

34:56.304 --> 34:59.724
I can't seem
to find the person
who murdered my wife.

35:01.601 --> 35:04.979
Bureaucracy is a bitch,
right?

35:07.815 --> 35:09.984
You want my husband.

35:10.651 --> 35:12.695
I can understand that.

35:13.738 --> 35:15.948
And I would like
the money I'm owed.

35:16.491 --> 35:19.118
So, why don't we
help each other, then?

35:19.202 --> 35:23.581
I'll testify
my husband didn't come home
the night of the murder.

35:23.664 --> 35:27.668
I left the party alone,
didn't see him
till the next day.

35:29.962 --> 35:33.841
I'll agree to that
if you release
the severance package.

35:39.347 --> 35:41.724
I need that money.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.476
I have a baby.

35:57.281 --> 36:00.827
Tyrell Wellick's baby
gets what it deserves.

36:04.205 --> 36:05.581
Nothing.

37:02.096 --> 37:03.139
Move!

37:03.222 --> 37:04.390
Get out of the car!

37:36.964 --> 37:39.884
Give me your phone,
or I'm walking.

37:39.967 --> 37:41.344
Jesus fucking Christ.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.137
Phone, now!

37:47.350 --> 37:50.436
Go two blocks up
and into the Looking Glass.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.418
Such an asshole.

38:14.502 --> 38:16.087
I had to make sure
you weren't followed.

38:16.170 --> 38:17.755
What the hell
are you talking about?

38:17.838 --> 38:20.549
No one's following me.
The FBI found your arcade.

38:24.720 --> 38:25.846
That doesn't make sense.

38:25.930 --> 38:26.973
How would they
even know...
I don't know.

38:27.056 --> 38:28.099
Maybe it has
something to do

38:28.182 --> 38:31.227
with the dead hacker
they found the other day?

38:31.310 --> 38:33.688
Yeah, I know
about that, too.

38:46.242 --> 38:48.285
Okay, you got to tell me,
and tell me right now.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.037
Is this Dark Army?

38:50.913 --> 38:54.625
Look, I can promise you
from the communications
I've seen that it's just...

38:54.709 --> 38:59.422
It's no way that it's them.
There's just
nothing in it for 'em.

39:01.632 --> 39:04.093
What's Elliot say
about all this?

39:05.219 --> 39:10.057
He doesn't know about Romero.
He's in a fragile state.

39:10.141 --> 39:11.642
We're past fragile, okay?

39:11.726 --> 39:16.689
This shit that we're in
has fucking shattered
into a million little pieces.

39:17.481 --> 39:19.400
You gotta tell him.

39:25.322 --> 39:27.533
What are you doing here?

39:32.246 --> 39:35.082
I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

39:36.125 --> 39:37.209
Oh.

39:37.501 --> 39:41.589
Well, I am
the fucking opposite of okay,
so tough shit.

39:45.885 --> 39:46.969
Hey...

39:47.053 --> 39:49.055
You want to help?

39:49.138 --> 39:51.974
Be a man
and let me be upset, okay?

40:12.119 --> 40:13.162
Okay.

40:25.674 --> 40:27.134
There's more.

40:29.136 --> 40:31.889
Our contacts found
out that Romero was
researching the FBI

40:31.972 --> 40:33.766
when he got killed.

40:34.975 --> 40:36.685
You know you're still
inside me, right?

40:36.769 --> 40:39.772
You got to understand,
Darlene.

40:39.855 --> 40:43.359
It doesn't look good.
The FBI is involved.

40:43.442 --> 40:47.655
It's making
the Dark Army nervous.
They think somebody flipped.

40:47.780 --> 40:51.408
Okay, get it together, dude.
No one fucking
talked to the FBI.

40:51.492 --> 40:54.703
You can tell your pals
to eat a dick, okay?
Now get off already.

40:54.829 --> 40:57.289
Don't be this stupid.

40:57.373 --> 40:59.750
They found your spot.

40:59.834 --> 41:03.212
The spot is fine.
We did a full wipe-down.
They won't find anything.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.257
Yeah, well,
they have something,

41:06.340 --> 41:08.759
and Romero must have
found out about it.

41:08.843 --> 41:11.929
He had a printout
with a roster of FBI agents

41:12.012 --> 41:15.516
on something called
"Operation Berenstain."

41:17.601 --> 41:19.353
It looked top secret,

41:20.271 --> 41:22.398
possibly heavy surveillance.

41:29.363 --> 41:30.489
Shit.

41:34.368 --> 41:37.830
Okay, what?
What? So, that's it, then?

41:37.913 --> 41:39.540
They know us?
We're under surveillance?

41:39.707 --> 41:41.333
No, no, no.
I'm not saying that.

41:44.795 --> 41:45.880
I got to leave the city.

41:45.963 --> 41:47.006
Wait, hold on.

41:47.089 --> 41:48.716
If you or anyone in
your crew takes off,

41:48.799 --> 41:50.426
that's one way to ensure
you get killed.

41:50.551 --> 41:51.719
That will make
you look guilty,

41:51.886 --> 41:53.012
and we know the Dark Army's
blanket rule.

41:53.095 --> 41:56.515
They think the FBI's
even snooping around,
and it gets ugly.

41:56.807 --> 42:01.562
So, just stop being
a hard-ass for once,
and just let me help you.

42:10.571 --> 42:13.073
How the fuck
did this happen?

42:14.158 --> 42:16.243
You seriously asking that?

42:17.453 --> 42:19.914
Do I need to remind you
what you did?

42:24.710 --> 42:27.922
They called it
the Good Samaritan law
on the account, like,

42:28.005 --> 42:31.008
you supposed to
be helping people
if they're in trouble.

42:31.091 --> 42:33.135
Like it was your duty
and whatnot,

42:33.219 --> 42:36.347
and if you didn't,
then you'd get arrested.

42:37.014 --> 42:40.059
But, yo, not only did
the homies do jack shit,

42:40.142 --> 42:43.562
they also laughed
at this fat dude
while he was getting mugged,

42:43.646 --> 42:45.940
and I ain't gonna lie,
that was fucked up,

42:46.065 --> 42:48.275
but it was
pretty funny, though.

42:55.199 --> 42:57.451
You staring at this thing.
You want to play?

43:00.788 --> 43:01.830
No.

43:02.623 --> 43:03.958
It's not for you.

43:05.626 --> 43:07.628
So, who's it for, then?

43:10.297 --> 43:11.507
Nobody.

43:13.384 --> 43:16.095
You know, back in
the Age of Enlightenment,

43:16.178 --> 43:20.015
motherfuckers used chess
as a means
of self-improvement,

43:21.392 --> 43:24.728
'cause there wasn't no
Tony Robbins DVDs back then.

43:24.812 --> 43:26.230
This was it.

43:27.523 --> 43:29.608
So, what you
playing for, then?

43:30.109 --> 43:32.903
If there's no who,
then what's the what?

43:32.987 --> 43:34.488
What's it for?

43:37.825 --> 43:39.159
Existence.

43:45.833 --> 43:49.169
Dope. Some high stakes
right there.

43:50.045 --> 43:52.131
So, what you waiting on?

43:53.632 --> 43:54.717
What?

43:58.012 --> 44:00.180
Do you dream, Elliot?

44:01.181 --> 44:04.059
You scraping so hard
like you ain't ever
asked yourself this before.

44:04.143 --> 44:07.896
I said, do you want to
be here right now?

44:08.022 --> 44:09.732
And I don't mean,
like, here, here,

44:09.857 --> 44:12.985
but I mean here
in a cosmic sense, bro.

44:13.527 --> 44:19.158
Like,
existence could be beautiful,
or it could be ugly,

44:20.200 --> 44:22.536
but that's on you.

44:28.667 --> 44:31.420
How do I know
which one's for me?

44:32.588 --> 44:33.922
Dream.

44:35.090 --> 44:39.094
You got to find out
the future
you're fighting for.

44:39.219 --> 44:41.013
Sometimes,
you got to close your eyes

44:41.096 --> 44:44.058
and really
envision that shit, bro.

44:45.100 --> 44:47.603
If you like it,
then it's beautiful.

44:47.728 --> 44:50.105
If you don't,

44:50.189 --> 44:53.275
then you might as well
fade the fuck out right now.

44:58.906 --> 45:00.908
You, me, in Madrid,

45:01.408 --> 45:03.452
walking down Calle de Atocha,

45:04.286 --> 45:07.456
sitting in CafÃ© La Rollerie,
having a cortado.

45:07.623 --> 45:11.043
I have some friends
who have
a vineyard on the coast.

45:12.378 --> 45:13.462
They would love you.

45:13.962 --> 45:17.049
During the harvest,
everyone goes there.

45:17.132 --> 45:18.759
It's beautiful
that time of year.

45:22.096 --> 45:23.722
What's wrong?

45:24.598 --> 45:26.600
Was it something I said?

45:27.893 --> 45:29.645
Madrid.

45:31.271 --> 45:35.442
Do you really think
you'll ever afford...
You'll ever afford that?

45:38.070 --> 45:42.324
Well, maybe not now,
but, like...

45:43.283 --> 45:45.911
Hey, once I get my
DJ career going, like,

45:45.994 --> 45:49.665
a lot of times,
they give you free trips.

45:51.291 --> 45:54.837
Like, for the jobs,
and I can take you.

45:57.923 --> 46:00.509
Derek, do you know
why I'm with you?

46:06.098 --> 46:08.308
Why I'm dating you?

46:09.852 --> 46:12.104
You're a bartender.

46:12.187 --> 46:14.314
You make $15 an hour.

46:15.941 --> 46:18.652
You're never gonna be able
to take me to Madrid.

46:20.195 --> 46:23.282
You're never gonna be able
to afford to take me anywhere.

46:26.160 --> 46:29.621
You won't be able to give me
anything I want out of life.

46:33.542 --> 46:35.544
But I've had
all those things before,

46:36.837 --> 46:38.630
and they never
made me happy.

46:41.049 --> 46:42.885
That's why I love you.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.847
You're not any of that.

46:49.224 --> 46:53.228
And I don't need you to be
anything more than you are.

47:07.034 --> 47:09.661
<i>If I do close my eyes,</i>

47:09.745 --> 47:12.748
<i>what is it that I picture
years from now?</i>

47:14.082 --> 47:19.505
<i>Like Leon said,
doesn't one need
to understand that</i>

47:19.588 --> 47:22.257
<i>before they're ready
to fight for their existence?</i>

47:26.178 --> 47:29.556
<i>How would my future
fairy tale unfold?</i>

47:36.438 --> 47:40.067
<i>Will I finally connect
with those
I deeply care for?</i>

47:48.450 --> 47:51.870
<i>Will I reunite
with old friends long gone?</i>

47:58.210 --> 48:01.588
<i>See the ones I love
find true happiness?</i>

48:17.771 --> 48:19.815
<i>Maybe this future
includes people</i>

48:19.982 --> 48:22.067
<i>I'd never dream of
getting close to.</i>

48:30.951 --> 48:34.830
<i>Even make amends
with those I have
unfairly wronged.</i>

48:58.604 --> 49:01.189
<i>A future that's
not so lonely.</i>

49:08.822 --> 49:11.867
<i>A future filled with
friends and family.</i>

49:33.847 --> 49:36.183
<i>You'd even be there.</i>

49:55.077 --> 49:57.871
<i>A world I've always wanted.</i>

49:59.873 --> 50:02.209
<i>And you know what?</i>

50:03.251 --> 50:06.713
<i>I would like very much
to fight for it.</i>

50:19.893 --> 50:22.896
<i>In chess,
help isn't allowed.</i>

50:23.730 --> 50:25.023
<i>That's the beauty of the game.</i>

50:27.609 --> 50:29.027
<i>You're locked
into a set of moves</i>

50:29.111 --> 50:31.113
<i>as determined by
your previous choices.</i>

50:36.451 --> 50:39.788
<i>Your options
dramatically changing
with every decision.</i>

50:40.622 --> 50:43.041
<i>There is no lifeline.</i>

50:43.125 --> 50:46.044
<i>There is no
external force at play.</i>

50:46.211 --> 50:49.798
<i>It is a pure battle
of two opponents,</i>

50:49.881 --> 50:52.801
<i>or in this case,</i>

50:52.884 --> 50:54.261
<i>one.</i>

50:56.471 --> 50:57.889
Stalemate.

51:01.601 --> 51:05.105
Again. We need a winner.
Let's reset.

51:12.779 --> 51:15.824
Remember when
you first taught me
how to code?

51:16.116 --> 51:17.325
Not really.

51:18.744 --> 51:20.662
It was a computer
chess game.

51:22.122 --> 51:23.999
You always told me
you had to know
more moves ahead

51:24.124 --> 51:25.292
than the player or user.

51:26.752 --> 51:28.670
Sounds like good advice
from a good father.

51:29.337 --> 51:31.298
Except for one thing.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.091
You're not my father.

51:34.676 --> 51:36.178
You're not even
here right now.

51:44.019 --> 51:45.645
Another stalemate.

51:46.354 --> 51:48.273
What are the odds?

51:49.649 --> 51:51.443
Let's reset.

51:57.324 --> 52:00.035
Doesn't it make you sick
that while you're here,
battling me,

52:00.160 --> 52:02.496
there are people out there
hurting everyone
we care about?

52:03.497 --> 52:05.332
Everyone's hurting
because of us.

52:05.791 --> 52:07.501
We are running
around in circles.

52:08.001 --> 52:09.503
This will be
the last time that we do.

52:09.795 --> 52:11.171
Thinking about
what you said earlier.

52:11.880 --> 52:16.051
You can think
all the moves you want,
but at the end of the day,

52:16.176 --> 52:18.804
the moves I'm making
are the ones
you're telling me to make.

52:19.471 --> 52:20.555
<i>He's right.</i>

52:20.639 --> 52:23.475
<i>There over nine million
different possible positions</i>

52:23.558 --> 52:25.060
<i>after three
chess moves each.</i>

52:25.185 --> 52:30.065
<i>There are over 288 billion
different possible positions
after four moves.</i>

52:30.398 --> 52:31.817
<i>The number of 40-move games</i>

52:31.900 --> 52:35.862
<i>is greater than
the number of electrons
in the observable universe.</i>

52:36.321 --> 52:38.156
<i>You don't need to
know those outcomes.</i>

52:38.907 --> 52:42.244
<i>You just need
to be able to see
ahead of your opponent.</i>

52:45.247 --> 52:48.250
<i>But how can you
when your other opponent is...</i>

52:51.086 --> 52:52.420
<i>...you?</i>

52:55.841 --> 52:57.384
Stalemate.

52:58.593 --> 52:59.886
Three in a row.

53:02.222 --> 53:03.431
The odds of that are...

53:03.515 --> 53:04.599
Impossible.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.103
Go again?

53:14.734 --> 53:16.361
I can't beat you.

53:18.989 --> 53:21.116
And you can't beat me.

53:27.080 --> 53:29.249
We could play again, but...

53:30.417 --> 53:33.253
We will always be
at this impasse.

53:39.092 --> 53:41.636
And you knew all along.

53:44.347 --> 53:45.849
It was the only way
to show you

53:45.974 --> 53:48.935
that fighting me
is a waste of time.

53:50.687 --> 53:51.771
No.

53:52.147 --> 53:54.441
No, we'll go again.
I can beat you.

53:55.942 --> 53:57.527
I can beat you.

54:00.113 --> 54:03.283
When will you
finally realize that
I'm here for a reason?

54:08.163 --> 54:09.331
This is avoidance!

54:09.623 --> 54:13.501
Our fight for that future
that you want
isn't with me at chess!

54:13.627 --> 54:16.212
It's what you do
out there with them.

54:18.173 --> 54:20.550
I want to be here, Elliot.

54:21.968 --> 54:23.511
With you.

54:39.194 --> 54:42.238
I want an office
on the 20th floor.

54:43.490 --> 54:46.701
I want Melissa's job,
and it's non-negotiable.

54:56.169 --> 54:57.712
Go on.

54:58.338 --> 55:00.090
I saw the pattern.

55:01.174 --> 55:03.176
In every version
of the settlement draft

55:03.259 --> 55:05.553
for the Washington
Township suit,

55:05.679 --> 55:08.682
there was one small point
that your team
wouldn't agree on.

55:09.432 --> 55:13.103
It remained the same,
even from the original case.

55:13.687 --> 55:17.399
That a third-party company
must perform inspections

55:17.524 --> 55:19.567
on the Washington
Township plant.

55:20.443 --> 55:23.571
You continue
to give up power on
all these other provisions

55:23.697 --> 55:27.158
that appear to be
a lot more expensive
and important.

55:27.242 --> 55:30.537
All in an attempt
to drop this one
small point.

55:32.539 --> 55:36.710
I know why you had
those guys arrested
and why you gave me this job.

55:36.793 --> 55:41.089
You want me
to convince the class
to remove the contingency.

55:41.214 --> 55:43.591
And I'm willing
to do all of that

55:45.552 --> 55:48.722
because you're gonna give me
exactly what I want in return.

55:56.730 --> 55:58.440
Those are my terms.

56:04.946 --> 56:06.614
I must say,

56:07.907 --> 56:10.827
you are very impressive.

56:15.331 --> 56:17.625
But I'm sorry, my dear.

56:19.627 --> 56:22.130
This is all in your head.

56:24.507 --> 56:26.593
Now, don't take
that as a slight.

56:29.929 --> 56:32.348
Always good to have dreams.

56:36.352 --> 56:37.437
Wait.

56:43.693 --> 56:45.612
I'm not wrong.

56:50.033 --> 56:51.493
Go home.

57:13.181 --> 57:14.390
Fuck.

57:18.353 --> 57:19.854
<i>Do you remember
the first command</i>

57:19.979 --> 57:22.524
<i>you ever taught me,
and my computer
kept crashing?</i>

57:24.192 --> 57:25.527
<i>It was Init 1.</i>

57:25.652 --> 57:28.113
<i>That became our thing,
and I am
telling you right now,</i>

57:28.196 --> 57:32.200
<i>I'm fucking crashing, man,
and so are you,
and I need your help.</i>

57:33.034 --> 57:35.745
<i>I need you to get on
the same channel we used to.</i>

57:35.870 --> 57:38.706
<i>I wouldn't ask you this
if it wasn't life or death.</i>

57:38.832 --> 57:41.960
<i>Okay? We're in
trouble this time,
Elliot, all of us.</i>

57:42.043 --> 57:43.419
Well, I have no access here.

57:43.545 --> 57:45.213
It's not as if I'm gonna
go back to my place.

57:45.338 --> 57:48.967
<i>Well, it needs to
happen ASAP,
so figure something out.</i>

57:49.050 --> 57:50.969
<i>We might be owned.</i>

57:51.052 --> 57:52.345
What?

57:53.179 --> 57:54.180
Why?

57:54.264 --> 57:56.099
<i>Well, I don't know,
but we need to.</i>

58:01.563 --> 58:02.772
<i>Elliot?</i>

58:03.565 --> 58:05.859
<i>God, Elliot, say something.</i>

58:11.739 --> 58:13.867
Did you mean what you said?

58:17.120 --> 58:20.874
That you wanted him,
not me?

58:24.627 --> 58:26.754
Did you mean it, Darlene?

58:28.089 --> 58:30.049
I need to know.

58:31.801 --> 58:33.219
<i>I want you.</i>

58:34.262 --> 58:35.638
<i>Only you.</i>

58:42.395 --> 58:43.771
Don't worry.

58:45.440 --> 58:46.900
I know what to do.

58:49.569 --> 58:53.615
Why are we back here?
You cannot do this.
You cannot confess.

58:53.740 --> 58:56.117
This won't save her.
They're gonna destroy her.

59:04.125 --> 59:05.418
Who won?

59:08.630 --> 59:09.797
No one.

59:29.442 --> 59:31.277
What else can I do you for?

59:32.153 --> 59:34.739
You tell him anything,
and it's suicide.

59:34.822 --> 59:37.408
I am pleading
with you, Elliot,
just walk away from this, now.

59:37.492 --> 59:38.826
I'm here to...

59:40.328 --> 59:44.165
To help you
with that computer problem
you've been having.

59:53.132 --> 59:56.010
I would ask
what made you
change your mind,

59:56.135 --> 59:57.887
but I'ma quit
while I'm ahead.

59:59.305 --> 1:00:00.348
Hey.

1:00:01.349 --> 1:00:03.518
Yeah, get in here.

1:00:13.528 --> 1:00:15.029
Did you know

1:00:17.699 --> 1:00:21.077
that Moses
heard voices, too?

1:00:23.871 --> 1:00:25.081
Abraham,

1:00:26.874 --> 1:00:30.253
John, Paul,

1:00:30.378 --> 1:00:31.546
Jesus.

1:00:33.172 --> 1:00:36.342
In fact, many prophets
confessed to hearing voices.

1:00:37.885 --> 1:00:39.262
People like you,

1:00:40.346 --> 1:00:41.764
what you have,

1:00:44.434 --> 1:00:48.104
it can be divinity,
Elliot, if you let it.

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:23.056
This is what
the last IT guys told me
I needed to do.

1:01:26.726 --> 1:01:30.229
This looks like it's just
a simple site migration.

1:01:31.147 --> 1:01:32.940
As long as
one of us understands.

1:01:36.110 --> 1:01:37.487
I got this.

1:01:45.953 --> 1:01:48.289
Elliot,
before you get started,

1:01:48.414 --> 1:01:50.249
there's something
you should know.

1:01:52.835 --> 1:01:55.630
My online business
is very important to me.

1:01:57.799 --> 1:01:59.133
I'm like you.
I'm a private guy.

1:02:00.802 --> 1:02:02.261
I prefer discretion.

1:02:05.807 --> 1:02:10.520
So, I'm asking you
to help me
with the task at hand

1:02:10.645 --> 1:02:12.522
and not look
where you don't need to.

1:02:24.450 --> 1:02:25.993
Why is he here?

1:02:27.662 --> 1:02:31.833
You need help,
something goes wrong,
Lone Star will be here.

1:02:32.959 --> 1:02:36.003
He's got my number
and can get in touch
with me right away.

1:02:45.221 --> 1:02:46.848
Thank you, again.

1:02:56.149 --> 1:02:57.358
<i>I know.</i>

1:02:58.484 --> 1:02:59.694
<i>I know.</i>

1:03:00.445 --> 1:03:04.323
<i>This is really scratching
that part of my brain again,</i>

1:03:04.407 --> 1:03:08.119
<i>but that's
the part of my brain
I need to start ignoring.</i>

1:03:31.100 --> 1:03:33.060
What's Darlene saying?

1:03:39.567 --> 1:03:40.902
The FBI.

1:03:43.779 --> 1:03:44.906
They found the arcade.

1:03:47.575 --> 1:03:49.994
There might be
a surveillance program.

1:03:55.583 --> 1:03:57.585
Romero's dead.

1:04:06.010 --> 1:04:09.263
<i>What do you think?
Is Ray right?</i>

1:04:10.139 --> 1:04:12.350
<i>Should I listen to the voice?</i>

1:04:12.433 --> 1:04:15.144
<i>Does it make me special?</i>

1:04:15.269 --> 1:04:16.687
<i>Like Moses?</i>

1:04:19.023 --> 1:04:21.359
<i>I don't have many options.</i>

1:04:21.442 --> 1:04:23.611
<i>My sister's in trouble.</i>

1:04:23.694 --> 1:04:26.864
<i>Someone's closing in on us,
and at least for her sake,</i>

1:04:27.698 --> 1:04:29.450
<i>I have to find
out what they know.</i>

1:04:31.536 --> 1:04:35.373
<i>Maybe this is how I fight
for that future I want.</i>

1:04:40.044 --> 1:04:42.046
What exactly are you doing?

1:04:43.673 --> 1:04:45.508
I'm hacking the FBI.
