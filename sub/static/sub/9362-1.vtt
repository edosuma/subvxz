00:19.037 --> 00:21.301
<i>- crime rate soaring to an all-time high.</i>

00:21.472 --> 00:24.669
<i>- virtual gridlock on capital-
- tax and spend, big government-</i>

00:24.842 --> 00:28.938
<i>- fear mongering, deregulation-
- filing for bankruptcy protection-</i>

00:29.113 --> 00:30.910
<i>- stock market takes a beating-</i>

00:31.082 --> 00:32.845
<i>- announced a new round of layoffs-</i>

00:33.017 --> 00:35.281
<i>- unprecedented deficit
is crippling the economy.</i>

00:35.453 --> 00:36.977
<i>We all need to tighten our belts.</i>

00:37.155 --> 00:38.986
<i>- riots breaking out in major cities.</i>

00:39.157 --> 00:41.625
<i>Our civil liberties are being trampled.</i>

00:42.860 --> 00:45.158
<i>Housing market continues its decline.</i>

00:45.330 --> 00:46.592
<i>- rabid inflation-</i>

00:46.764 --> 00:48.857
<i>- affecting global markets.</i>

00:49.033 --> 00:52.196
<i>Severe economic downturn
may be, quote, "irreversible. "</i>

00:52.370 --> 00:55.362
<i>- declare a state of emergency.
- mobilizing armed troops.</i>

00:55.540 --> 00:58.873
<i>- today imposed martial law.
Death toll now stands at 87.</i>

00:59.043 --> 01:00.340
<i>Lex Luthor's attempt...</i>

01:00.511 --> 01:02.672
<i>...to win the presidency
the old-fashioned way...</i>

01:02.847 --> 01:04.815
...by buying it,
seems to be picking up steam.

01:06.284 --> 01:08.309
New polls show
that 22 percent of Americans...

01:08.486 --> 01:11.046
...now support his third-party bid.

01:11.222 --> 01:13.053
In a completely unrelated story...

01:13.224 --> 01:15.920
...twenty-two percent
of Americans indicate a preference...

01:16.094 --> 01:18.460
...for getting * * * * * * in the * * *
with a red-hot poker.

01:20.365 --> 01:22.526
Tough times require a tough man.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.361
And the tougher times get...

01:24.535 --> 01:29.097
...the more the voters will realize
they need me in the Oval Office.

01:36.481 --> 01:38.915
And not the least
of the problems we face...

01:39.083 --> 01:42.712
...is that of aliens
and so-called superheroes...

01:42.887 --> 01:47.881
...who act on their own as judge,
jury, and often, executioner.

01:48.059 --> 01:50.027
No one is above the law.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.924
I learned that for myself many years ago.

01:53.097 --> 01:55.497
And now
this principle will be the driving force...

01:55.667 --> 01:57.157
...of my presidency.

01:58.436 --> 02:01.803
I have already taken steps
to bring some of these superhumans...

02:01.973 --> 02:03.838
...into the service of our government...

02:04.008 --> 02:06.203
...where their unique powers
will be utilized...

02:06.377 --> 02:08.538
...for the benefit of all Americans.

02:08.713 --> 02:11.443
They are Captain Atom...

02:11.616 --> 02:13.243
...Black Lightning...

02:13.418 --> 02:14.976
...Power Girl...

02:15.153 --> 02:17.348
...Katana, and Major Force.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.090
I hope
that in the months to come...

02:23.261 --> 02:26.594
<i>...many more will voluntarily
make the choice they've made.</i>

02:26.764 --> 02:29.198
<i>And if they don't, they will find...</i>

02:29.367 --> 02:33.997
...that they are not as far
above the law as they think.

04:52.944 --> 04:56.107
<i>This started
with a routine traffic stop an hour ago.</i>

04:56.280 --> 04:58.271
<i>The driver brandished a gun
at police, and-</i>

04:58.449 --> 05:00.849
<i>Whoa! That was close.</i>

05:01.018 --> 05:03.316
<i>This man's car
has close to 600 horsepower...</i>

05:03.487 --> 05:05.546
<i>...and can go
almost 200 miles an hour.</i>

05:05.723 --> 05:08.089
<i>That's faster than any police car.</i>

05:08.259 --> 05:12.093
<i>And even the helicopters
are having a hard time keeping up w-</i>

05:12.263 --> 05:13.958
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

05:41.492 --> 05:44.222
<i>So this is what you've been up to
these last few months.</i>

05:44.395 --> 05:45.692
Chasing cars.

05:46.130 --> 05:48.394
<i>I help wherever I'm needed.</i>

05:48.566 --> 05:50.830
<i>But you haven't been
needed much lately, have you?</i>

05:51.769 --> 05:55.569
- What do you want?
- We want you to admit something.

05:55.740 --> 05:58.140
<i>I'll shoot myself, I swear!</i>

05:58.309 --> 05:59.503
Just a minute.

06:01.212 --> 06:03.305
<i>I'm gonna- Ah!</i>

06:06.617 --> 06:09.313
- Come on, you.
- Out of the car.

06:11.589 --> 06:13.181
Now, what am I supposed to admit?

06:13.357 --> 06:16.520
<i>That Luthor hasn't done a bad job.</i>

06:21.365 --> 06:24.129
Told you this would be a waste of time.

06:25.603 --> 06:28.197
Luthor did the one thing
nobody was expecting.

06:28.372 --> 06:29.805
He made things boring again.

06:29.974 --> 06:31.601
<i>And boring is good, isn't it?</i>

06:31.776 --> 06:34.210
The economy is back to normal.
Crime is down.

06:34.378 --> 06:36.869
There are no wars or anything.

06:38.249 --> 06:40.581
<i>He's up to something.
Can't anybody see that?</i>

06:40.751 --> 06:42.218
<i>That's what I thought at first.</i>

06:42.386 --> 06:44.513
<i>Eventually, I realized
all he's trying to do...</i>

06:44.689 --> 06:48.318
...is put that formidable intellect
to work doing such a good job...

06:48.492 --> 06:51.017
...no one will have a choice
but to respect him.

06:51.195 --> 06:53.060
<i>It's all about ego now.</i>

06:53.230 --> 06:55.790
<i>I'll never respect him. He's a sick man.</i>

06:55.967 --> 06:58.060
<i>He's not the first to sit in the Oval Office.</i>

06:58.235 --> 07:01.204
<i>He's right. There have been womanizers,
drunks, crooks...</i>

07:01.372 --> 07:05.035
...but Nixon helped turn our worst enemy
into our best trading partner.

07:05.209 --> 07:07.370
And Johnson gave us
the Voting Rights Act.

07:07.545 --> 07:10.207
<i>Thanks for the history lesson,
but I'm not buying it.</i>

07:10.381 --> 07:12.941
Come on, work with us. Please?

07:13.117 --> 07:15.017
We need you.

07:16.153 --> 07:17.745
Sorry.

07:23.461 --> 07:27.090
<i>I guess Luthor's not the only one
with an ego.</i>

07:34.572 --> 07:36.699
Is the spectrographic analysis
complete yet?

07:36.874 --> 07:40.742
Yes, sir. And the new data
confirms our original analysis.

07:41.178 --> 07:42.805
The meteor is pure kryptonite.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.642
A chunk of Krypton
the size of a small country.

07:45.816 --> 07:49.149
<i>That planet's been an endless source
of grief for me.</i>

07:49.320 --> 07:51.788
The new numbers also indicate
our original estimate...

07:51.956 --> 07:54.049
...of time of impact was right.

07:54.225 --> 07:56.318
Seven days.

07:56.494 --> 08:00.692
<i>Correction. There's not going to be
any impact.</i>

08:01.665 --> 08:02.757
<i>What's the plan?</i>

08:02.933 --> 08:03.991
Missiles.

08:04.168 --> 08:07.035
<i>We've never shot down
anything that big before.</i>

08:07.204 --> 08:08.466
The missiles will work.

08:08.639 --> 08:13.008
When I first heard about this,
I started doing the calculations myself.

08:13.177 --> 08:14.735
<i>You're brooding, Amanda.</i>

08:14.912 --> 08:18.643
<i>I'm just thinking
we have all sorts of other firepower.</i>

08:18.816 --> 08:21.284
You mean those so-called superheroes?

08:21.452 --> 08:24.512
They do work for you now.
Most of them, anyway.

08:24.688 --> 08:27.054
<i>That's to keep them
from working against me.</i>

08:27.224 --> 08:30.250
<i>I'm not going to put the fate
of this planet in the hands of...</i>

08:30.428 --> 08:32.395
Of freaks and monsters.

08:32.563 --> 08:35.225
<i>- That's not why you won't use them.
No?</i>

08:35.399 --> 08:37.697
You want all the credit for yourself.

08:37.868 --> 08:39.028
Careful.

08:39.203 --> 08:41.171
Try thinking of it this way:

08:41.337 --> 08:45.138
<i>If you don't reach out
to some of those freaks and monsters...</i>

08:45.309 --> 08:49.541
...there might not be a planet left
to feed that massive ego of yours.

08:49.713 --> 08:53.274
Now, if you have nothing else for me...

08:59.390 --> 09:01.756
Ms. Waller.

09:01.926 --> 09:04.588
Thank you for your honesty.

09:09.233 --> 09:13.636
<i>And I want to assure all Americans
and all the citizens of the world...</i>

09:13.804 --> 09:16.602
...that I intend to handle this meteor
with the efficiency...

09:16.774 --> 09:19.174
...that characterized
my previous endeavors.

09:19.343 --> 09:24.007
<i>But, as a precaution,
I'd like to meet with Superman...</i>

09:24.181 --> 09:25.512
<i>...as soon as possible.</i>

09:25.950 --> 09:29.386
<i>It's time to bury our rivalry
once and for all...</i>

09:29.553 --> 09:32.716
<i>...and work together
for the good of mankind.</i>

09:32.890 --> 09:34.755
<i>This is one time he's not lying.</i>

09:34.925 --> 09:36.620
About burying the rivalry?

09:37.094 --> 09:39.927
<i>- I don't think so.
No. About the meteor.</i>

09:40.097 --> 09:43.089
<i>I've been following it the last few days
with my own instruments.</i>

09:43.267 --> 09:46.168
I could go up there in a lead suit
and smash the thing.

09:46.337 --> 09:49.397
<i>There's no amount of lead
that could keep out so much radiation.</i>

09:49.573 --> 09:52.098
<i>And it wouldn't stand up
to all that smashing either.</i>

09:52.276 --> 09:53.436
Got anything better?

09:54.512 --> 09:56.878
<i>I'm working on something
with one of my contacts.</i>

10:00.851 --> 10:03.115
<i>You're going to go
and meet with him, aren't you?</i>

10:03.287 --> 10:04.481
You know me too well.

10:04.655 --> 10:06.987
<i>I can't just stand back and do nothing.</i>

10:07.158 --> 10:10.559
<i>Well, when it all goes south,
don't count on me to save you.</i>

10:11.195 --> 10:12.287
<i>I won't.</i>

10:12.463 --> 10:14.863
I know you pretty well too.

10:46.197 --> 10:47.357
Well?

10:47.531 --> 10:50.762
Somehow, I knew that would be
the first word out of your mouth.

10:52.803 --> 10:55.897
<i>When the meteor gets close enough,
I'm sending up a dozen missiles.</i>

10:56.073 --> 10:58.667
Each one is going to have
a 50-megaton warhead.

10:58.842 --> 11:00.002
What do you want from me?

11:00.177 --> 11:04.671
<i>Some of my people don't have
as much confidence in this plan as I do.</i>

11:04.848 --> 11:06.338
They think I need a backup.

11:06.517 --> 11:09.111
<i>With the whole world at stake,
that's not a bad idea.</i>

11:09.286 --> 11:11.618
<i>Does that mean
you're willing to work for me?</i>

11:11.789 --> 11:15.987
<i>- For you?
- Yes. You'll be working for me.</i>

11:16.160 --> 11:19.652
But only insofar as I represent
the country that adopted you.

11:19.830 --> 11:22.060
And that you love.

11:22.233 --> 11:26.033
<i>What's wrong?
Was I getting too sentimental?</i>

11:28.372 --> 11:29.396
Luthor.

11:29.573 --> 11:31.370
<i>You think I'd be crazy enough...</i>

11:31.542 --> 11:35.239
...to meet you
without some kind of protection?

11:38.916 --> 11:41.817
- Metallo.
- Who else could stand up to you?

11:50.961 --> 11:54.328
<i>Shouldn't have done that.
He's the president.</i>

14:23.981 --> 14:26.176
<i>- That's not gonna hold him for long.
- I know.</i>

14:26.350 --> 14:28.580
<i>That's why you have to get out of here.</i>

14:53.577 --> 14:55.010
Superman.

14:56.613 --> 14:59.207
From me to you.

15:21.605 --> 15:24.301
What was that explosion? Plastique?

15:24.475 --> 15:27.706
<i>- Something like that.
- It won't stop him.</i>

15:27.878 --> 15:31.473
<i>- He's going to reconfigure.
- Don't worry about that now.</i>

15:35.652 --> 15:37.586
The kryptonite is near your heart.

15:37.754 --> 15:40.245
<i>I don't know if I'll get it
before the wound closes.</i>

15:40.424 --> 15:42.324
<i>Where's The Flash when you need him?</i>

15:42.493 --> 15:44.484
Do me a favor
and lose the sense of humor.

15:44.661 --> 15:46.993
Do us both a favor and buy one.

16:05.182 --> 16:08.276
<i>We can't go back up.
He might still be there.</i>

16:08.452 --> 16:10.511
Neither of us is in any shape
to take him on.

16:10.687 --> 16:12.678
Then what are we supposed to do?

16:12.856 --> 16:15.120
The cemetery was built
over the old sewer system.

16:15.292 --> 16:17.385
But how can we-?

16:19.997 --> 16:23.364
<i>- Are you up to it?
- We'll find out, won't we?</i>

16:41.552 --> 16:43.349
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>

17:00.971 --> 17:02.802
Bruce.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.203
<i>It's not ending here.</i>

17:09.378 --> 17:10.811
<i>I won't let it.</i>

17:15.519 --> 17:17.180
I thought...

17:18.121 --> 17:20.316
...I was supposed to rescue you.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.424
There might still be time for that.

17:25.095 --> 17:27.029
Can we get to your cave from here?

17:27.196 --> 17:29.290
Eventually.

17:31.201 --> 17:34.432
Time for you to see my side of the world.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.407
Some company you keep.

17:49.019 --> 17:52.011
Come on, Bruce. Stay with me.

17:52.823 --> 17:55.189
You know who I was thinking
about the other day?

17:55.359 --> 17:57.088
Who?
- Magpie.

17:57.260 --> 17:59.592
The criminal?
- Do we know another Magpie?

17:59.763 --> 18:00.957
Whatever happened to her?

18:01.131 --> 18:04.066
- She died.
- No. Are you sure?

18:04.234 --> 18:05.428
Reasonably.

18:05.602 --> 18:08.070
Why is it that good villains never die?

18:08.238 --> 18:11.366
Clark, what the hell are good villains?

18:16.813 --> 18:19.475
- Can you do it?
- Sure.

18:19.650 --> 18:22.084
Bend steel and all that.

18:39.403 --> 18:40.529
Clark.

18:40.971 --> 18:42.996
It tickles.

18:43.173 --> 18:44.333
Halt.

18:44.808 --> 18:46.639
Identify yourselves.

18:46.810 --> 18:50.940
<i>Alfred, it's me.
- Master Bruce.</i>

19:02.459 --> 19:03.949
You can rest easy, sir.

19:04.127 --> 19:05.856
<i>I'm already feeling better. Thanks.</i>

19:06.029 --> 19:09.795
I took the liberty of washing
and repairing your shirt and cape.

19:09.966 --> 19:14.767
The souvenirs of the Gotham City sewers
are best left under the streets.

19:14.938 --> 19:17.736
<i>I'm sure Lois will appreciate that.</i>

19:21.978 --> 19:23.673
<i>- honor and distinction.</i>

19:23.847 --> 19:27.283
<i>John Corben might have been
more machine than man...</i>

19:27.451 --> 19:29.510
<i>...but he was still human.</i>

19:29.686 --> 19:33.679
<i>A human being
who certainly didn't deserve this.</i>

19:34.558 --> 19:38.892
<i>He came to me months ago,
seeking a pardon and a fresh start...</i>

19:39.062 --> 19:41.030
<i>...and, mindful of my own history...</i>

19:41.198 --> 19:43.996
<i>...as well as his enormous potential
for good...</i>

19:44.167 --> 19:45.794
<i>...I granted him both.</i>

19:45.969 --> 19:50.167
<i>In the short time Mr. Corben had left,
he worked hard for this country...</i>

19:50.340 --> 19:54.174
<i>...helping to keep her secure
from terrorist threats.</i>

19:54.344 --> 19:57.973
<i>Then, last night,
John Corben was murdered.</i>

19:58.148 --> 20:00.139
<i>Murdered, our prosecutors believe...</i>

20:00.317 --> 20:03.013
<i>...by a man
who used his own freakish power...</i>

20:03.186 --> 20:08.488
<i>...to settle a personal score
in violation of the laws that bind us all.</i>

20:08.658 --> 20:12.822
<i>A man who calls himself Superman.</i>

20:13.263 --> 20:15.231
<i>Does he think
anybody's gonna believe that?</i>

20:15.398 --> 20:17.366
<i>I met with Superman
to try to enlist him...</i>

20:17.534 --> 20:19.798
<i>...in the government's effort
to stop the meteor.</i>

20:19.970 --> 20:22.530
<i>He, of all people,
should have been eager to help.</i>

20:22.706 --> 20:24.970
<i>But instead, he lost his temper.</i>

20:25.142 --> 20:27.872
<i>Metallo stepped in to protect me.</i>

20:28.678 --> 20:32.375
<i>And this is what Superman did to him.</i>

20:40.090 --> 20:42.615
<i>I know many of you
will find it difficult to believe...</i>

20:42.793 --> 20:44.727
<i>...that Superman could do this.</i>

20:44.895 --> 20:46.795
<i>I shared that skepticism...</i>

20:46.963 --> 20:49.454
<i>...until some of our top scientists
reminded me...</i>

20:49.633 --> 20:52.193
<i>...that Superman's vulnerability
to kryptonite...</i>

20:52.369 --> 20:55.099
<i>...can have a psychological component.</i>

20:55.272 --> 20:58.400
<i>In other words,
the radiation from the approaching meteor...</i>

20:58.575 --> 21:01.908
<i>...is affecting Superman's mind.</i>

21:02.078 --> 21:03.841
<i>He's a danger to us all now.</i>

21:04.014 --> 21:05.879
<i>And himself as well.</i>

21:06.049 --> 21:07.414
<i>In accordance with that...</i>

21:07.584 --> 21:09.484
<i>...I am announcing a bounty on him...</i>

21:09.653 --> 21:13.646
<i>...in the amount of one billion dollars.</i>

21:13.824 --> 21:16.315
It pains me to do this...

21:16.493 --> 21:18.984
...but as our planet faces
its gravest peril...

21:19.162 --> 21:23.929
<i>...we cannot afford to be distracted
by one man's growing irrationality.</i>

21:25.168 --> 21:27.830
Thank you and good night.

21:28.004 --> 21:31.531
<i>And we're out.
Thank you, Mr. President.</i>

21:32.709 --> 21:34.904
<i>Let's go, people.</i>

21:45.455 --> 21:47.252
Come in.

21:47.424 --> 21:51.758
<i>Mr. President, can I talk to you?
It's really important.</i>

21:55.799 --> 21:57.994
"Growing irrationality"?

21:58.168 --> 22:00.329
- Who does he think-?
- Can it affect your mind?

22:00.503 --> 22:03.165
No. I mean, it never has.

22:03.340 --> 22:05.535
Look, this whole thing
is just plain ridiculous.

22:05.709 --> 22:07.700
<i>- I can prove I didn't kill him.
- How?</i>

22:07.878 --> 22:10.210
You were with me the whole time, and-

22:10.881 --> 22:15.079
<i>- Oh.
- I'll figure out a way to clear this up later.</i>

22:15.252 --> 22:18.153
Right now,
you and I have a meteor to stop.

22:18.321 --> 22:20.380
<i>He didn't do it. I'm sure of it.</i>

22:20.557 --> 22:21.717
Oh, really?

22:21.892 --> 22:24.053
<i>It's just not in him.</i>

22:25.896 --> 22:27.056
Do me a favor.

22:27.230 --> 22:29.460
Think back to three years ago.

22:29.633 --> 22:33.569
Could you have even dreamed back then
that I would be president today?

22:34.004 --> 22:36.404
Did you think it was in me?

22:39.242 --> 22:44.578
<i>Then if I could change that much,
couldn't he?</i>

23:00.830 --> 23:02.229
<i>You're late. What took you?</i>

23:02.399 --> 23:04.924
<i>I honestly don't think you'd understand.</i>

23:05.101 --> 23:06.898
- Lois?
- Mm-hm.

23:07.070 --> 23:08.367
<i>You're right.</i>

23:12.742 --> 23:14.733
<i>You know,
you didn't need to use the wire.</i>

23:14.911 --> 23:18.847
- I could have carried you.
- Between you and me, I hate that.

23:19.349 --> 23:21.044
<i>This won't take long.</i>

23:26.656 --> 23:30.057
- See something?
- Smell something.

23:39.302 --> 23:41.532
Now even I can smell it.

23:55.618 --> 23:58.985
They must think I did this
with my heat vision.

24:02.025 --> 24:05.586
<i>You couldn't have.
Not unless your heat vision is radioactive.</i>

24:05.762 --> 24:07.923
<i>It's not, is it?</i>

24:11.401 --> 24:13.835
No. This way.

24:18.008 --> 24:21.466
<i>- Now I really do look like a criminal.
- It's done wonders for me.</i>

24:21.644 --> 24:23.578
But how do we get the data now?

24:23.747 --> 24:25.146
<i>There's one other possibility.</i>

24:57.047 --> 24:59.242
<i>Okay, where's your friend?</i>

24:59.416 --> 25:04.183
<i>Yeah. The one
who's worth a billion bucks.</i>

25:04.788 --> 25:08.349
You wanna play it that way? Okay.

25:22.505 --> 25:24.905
<i>Superman.
- Little busy at the moment.</i>

25:26.976 --> 25:29.035
When you can, bring the heat.

25:38.855 --> 25:40.652
Now!

25:46.096 --> 25:48.462
- You all right?
- Better than them, anyway.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.861
<i>Banshee's out.
Can you keep her that way?</i>

25:51.034 --> 25:54.470
Hypersonics.
Effective even on metahumans.

25:54.637 --> 25:55.831
If she tries anything...

25:56.005 --> 25:58.473
...this will drive her scream
right back at her.

25:59.943 --> 26:02.434
- More?
- Everyone wants that reward.

26:19.362 --> 26:22.354
All you are is a rat with wings.

26:22.532 --> 26:27.765
And what better way to get rid of a rat
than by drowning it?

26:43.186 --> 26:47.145
<i>There. That wasn't too difficult.
I'll have to ask the Joker...</i>

26:47.323 --> 26:51.521
<i>...why he's had so much trouble
doing this over the years.</i>

26:51.694 --> 26:54.663
<i>So this isn't a complete waste
of my energies...</i>

26:54.831 --> 26:58.562
<i>...let's have a peek under that cowl.</i>

27:02.272 --> 27:04.934
What do you need with money, Mongul?

27:05.108 --> 27:07.941
<i>All you've ever cared about
is ruling the universe.</i>

27:11.347 --> 27:13.144
Grundy not feel good.

27:13.316 --> 27:15.511
Grundy gonna feel a lot worse.

27:24.961 --> 27:26.292
Shiva.

27:27.030 --> 27:30.227
<i>You wanna be Luthor's boy now?</i>

27:30.934 --> 27:32.094
<i>I'm sick...</i>

27:33.536 --> 27:35.128
...of Lex Luthor.

27:50.753 --> 27:53.051
<i>Mongul wasn't his usual
talkative self.</i>

27:53.223 --> 27:55.691
And Grundy
sounded like William F. Buckley.

27:55.858 --> 27:58.383
<i>You think
there's some kind of mind control going on?</i>

27:58.561 --> 28:01.052
A telepath, or maybe a-?

28:02.498 --> 28:04.932
- Nightshade.
Interesting.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.932
Even the lesser ones have some value...

28:07.103 --> 28:09.435
...when their powers
are put to the proper use.

28:09.606 --> 28:11.096
I know that speech pattern.

28:18.648 --> 28:19.876
Top of that building.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.185
Grodd. Of course.

28:27.890 --> 28:31.223
<i>Had to be a telepath.
Heard a gorilla's heartbeat.</i>

28:39.569 --> 28:41.127
Pull.

28:46.709 --> 28:48.870
Hey. What-?

28:57.520 --> 29:00.751
<i>We're surrounded.
I can hear them coming.</i>

29:22.445 --> 29:24.709
<i>I suppose it's useless to tell you to leave.</i>

29:24.881 --> 29:26.610
<i>I wouldn't miss this for anything.</i>

29:26.783 --> 29:28.944
- Your funeral.
- Already had one.

30:40.056 --> 30:43.321
- I never believed in the cavalry.
- Captain Atom, I wanna thank you-

30:43.493 --> 30:47.224
I have a federal warrant
for your arrest, Superman.

30:48.498 --> 30:51.228
So much for the cavalry.

31:01.344 --> 31:03.005
Are you all right, Mr. President?

31:03.813 --> 31:06.247
Fine. But thank you for asking.

31:23.699 --> 31:25.030
At ease, at ease.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.699
<i>Let's see those missiles, general.</i>

31:29.405 --> 31:31.202
You sold out to Luthor.

31:31.374 --> 31:32.773
<i>I'm doing my duty.</i>

31:32.942 --> 31:35.672
<i>Look, this isn't my decision to make.
It's the court's.</i>

31:35.845 --> 31:38.575
<i>"Court's"? This is Luthor's vendetta.</i>

31:38.748 --> 31:41.740
Power Girl,
what do you think about all this?

31:41.918 --> 31:45.149
<i>It doesn't matter what any of us thinks.
Luthor is the president...</i>

31:45.321 --> 31:46.913
...and what he says goes.

31:47.089 --> 31:49.353
Now, are you coming or not?

31:49.792 --> 31:51.384
Not.

31:56.299 --> 31:57.561
You piece of-

32:38.074 --> 32:39.837
Look out!

33:10.206 --> 33:11.867
Enough.

33:59.288 --> 34:02.883
Some of our scientists were
going over the scenario in their computers.

34:03.059 --> 34:05.323
<i>They don't think the missiles
will be enough to-</i>

34:05.494 --> 34:08.088
<i>General, I don't care
what your scientists think.</i>

34:08.264 --> 34:10.255
The missiles will knock out that meteor.

34:10.433 --> 34:13.630
- I did all the calculations myself.
- Yes, sir.

34:15.737 --> 34:17.933
<i>Captain Atom. This isn't the best time.</i>

34:18.107 --> 34:20.667
<i>I'm sorry, sir,
but you wanted to be kept apprised.</i>

34:20.842 --> 34:23.572
Yes. Fine. Do you have them in custody?

34:23.746 --> 34:25.543
<i>- No, sir.
- What happened?</i>

34:25.715 --> 34:27.478
<i>- We lost Power Girl.
- She's dead?</i>

34:27.650 --> 34:29.550
<i>- We're not sure. She-
- Captain Atom...</i>

34:29.719 --> 34:32.016
...I have three words for you:

34:32.188 --> 34:35.885
Finish your job.

34:37.226 --> 34:38.625
Superheroes.

34:39.695 --> 34:42.219
<i>It's not gonna be any easier
without Power Girl.</i>

34:42.398 --> 34:44.195
We should have killed them.

34:44.367 --> 34:47.097
We do not kill people. Understand?

34:47.803 --> 34:49.134
Is that right?

34:58.781 --> 35:01.375
- You all right?
- Uh-huh.

35:01.550 --> 35:04.417
- What made you do that?
- Warn you?

35:04.587 --> 35:06.612
It just sort of came out.

35:06.789 --> 35:11.385
<i>- You don't think I killed Metallo, do you?
- Don't know. Luthor says you did.</i>

35:12.495 --> 35:14.463
Tell me something, Power Girl.

35:14.630 --> 35:17.258
<i>Now that you've been up close
and personal with Luthor...</i>

35:17.433 --> 35:20.061
<i>- ... how do you feel about him?
- He's the president.</i>

35:20.236 --> 35:22.261
<i>But how do you feel
when you're around him?</i>

35:22.438 --> 35:24.065
He-

35:24.240 --> 35:25.901
He makes my skin crawl.

35:26.075 --> 35:28.407
Sometimes you have
to trust your instincts.

35:28.577 --> 35:29.908
But how do you know when?

35:30.846 --> 35:32.541
Now.

35:39.255 --> 35:42.088
<i>- See? She's a traitor.
- Is that true?</i>

35:42.258 --> 35:44.988
<i>- It's complicated.
- No, it isn't.</i>

36:53.262 --> 36:56.060
- Tell me something.
- What do you want, dirtbag?

36:56.232 --> 36:58.666
Did Metallo say anything
before he died?

36:58.834 --> 37:01.234
Was he surprised to see you?

37:01.403 --> 37:03.371
<i>I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

37:03.539 --> 37:05.666
What did Luthor promise you?

37:05.841 --> 37:07.866
- Money?
What do I need with money?

37:08.043 --> 37:09.772
<i>I'm living energy.</i>

37:09.945 --> 37:13.813
<i>You're not going to tell me you killed him
for your country, are you?</i>

37:13.983 --> 37:18.613
Some of us still believe
in putting our country first.

37:18.788 --> 37:21.621
<i>Sorry, but I don't see any patriotism here.</i>

37:21.791 --> 37:25.454
<i>All I see is a psycho who's latched
onto an excuse to kill people...</i>

37:25.628 --> 37:30.725
<i>...and who's so stupid he doesn't realize
he's being used by Luthor.</i>

37:42.044 --> 37:43.978
<i>Power Girl, don't!</i>

37:51.220 --> 37:52.619
<i>Do you know what you've done?</i>

37:54.723 --> 37:56.884
Can either of you contain that radiation?

37:57.059 --> 38:00.222
- I might be able to put up a force field.
- Go.

38:08.938 --> 38:12.237
<i>- He's not gonna be able to keep that up.
I can absorb it.</i>

38:13.042 --> 38:17.638
<i>- Captain, I can't let you-
- I was watching. And listening.</i>

38:17.813 --> 38:19.337
This is the least I can do.

38:26.589 --> 38:27.647
<i>Let's do this.</i>

39:39.295 --> 39:44.323
Five, four, three, two, one.

39:44.767 --> 39:46.462
Liftoff.

39:57.413 --> 39:59.074
<i>And they're on their way.</i>

40:04.320 --> 40:06.117
Wormhole generator engaged.

40:22.972 --> 40:24.064
Closing on target.

40:38.721 --> 40:42.122
<i>Don't worry.
I'm not going to say "I told you so. "</i>

40:42.291 --> 40:44.020
Good thing.

40:47.429 --> 40:49.397
General, what the hell happened?

40:49.565 --> 40:50.896
You-

40:51.066 --> 40:53.967
<i>We didn't take into account
all that radiation.</i>

40:54.403 --> 40:56.871
It detonated the warheads
before they hit.

40:57.039 --> 40:58.700
So the meteor is-

40:58.874 --> 41:01.035
Still on course.

41:40.015 --> 41:42.006
Well, this is it.

41:44.119 --> 41:45.848
<i>Luthor's got his own office in there.</i>

41:46.021 --> 41:48.319
<i>This has to be where he's keeping
the information.</i>

41:48.490 --> 41:50.788
And by now,
they must have the numbers we need...

41:50.959 --> 41:52.620
<i>...on the meteor's radiation level.</i>

41:52.795 --> 41:54.456
<i>- So how do we get in?
- Don't worry.</i>

41:54.630 --> 41:55.961
<i>We've got it worked out.</i>

41:56.131 --> 41:58.292
But you need to be somewhere else
right now.

41:58.467 --> 41:59.866
- Yeah, but-
- Go.

42:06.675 --> 42:11.169
<i>They're bound to have all kinds of radar.
We should go the rest of the way on foot.</i>

42:14.850 --> 42:17.045
<i>We do have something worked out,
don't we?</i>

42:17.219 --> 42:20.382
<i>No. But I'm sure it'll come to me.</i>

42:35.704 --> 42:40.004
<i>It doesn't take the wisdom of Solomon
to know you should stay down.</i>

42:40.175 --> 42:42.473
Tell me something, Captain Marvel.

42:42.644 --> 42:45.841
Would Solomon have gone to work
for Lex Luthor?

42:48.250 --> 42:51.617
<i>Batman, don't make this any more difficult
than it has to be.</i>

43:05.801 --> 43:08.634
You wanna play it that way? Fine.

43:24.353 --> 43:27.982
<i>You know,
you've never been any good against magic.</i>

43:30.325 --> 43:32.987
<i>And magic's what I'm all about.</i>

43:46.441 --> 43:49.501
- Superman. Castling.
- Good call.

44:11.934 --> 44:13.799
Captain Marvel?

44:18.640 --> 44:20.608
Hawkman, before you black out...

44:20.776 --> 44:23.540
<i>...I want you to know
I wish it didn't have to be like this.</i>

44:23.712 --> 44:25.202
Before I black out?

44:35.991 --> 44:37.288
Are you all right?

44:38.393 --> 44:40.020
Say something.

44:40.896 --> 44:43.091
Shizam.

44:56.211 --> 45:00.409
<i>This initial attempt was planned
from the start only as a research mission.</i>

45:00.582 --> 45:02.948
<i>Now that I have the data I need
about the meteor...</i>

45:03.118 --> 45:06.610
<i>...I'll be able to put the second phase
of my plan into operation.</i>

45:06.788 --> 45:09.780
<i>I want to assure you that I will deal
with this promptly and effectively.</i>

45:11.460 --> 45:14.952
<i>You have nothing to fear,
so, please, continue your work...</i>

45:15.130 --> 45:17.758
<i>...your play, your travel, your shopping...</i>

45:17.933 --> 45:19.901
<i>...and everything else you normally do.</i>

45:20.068 --> 45:23.231
<i>Thank you, and may God-</i>

45:29.778 --> 45:31.405
<i>I'm sorry, no one's allowed-</i>

45:31.580 --> 45:34.208
<i>Mr. President,
the whole country's in a state of panic...</i>

45:34.383 --> 45:37.682
<i>...and they're ready to take you out
behind a barn and-</i>

45:42.624 --> 45:44.353
What are you-?

45:44.993 --> 45:47.223
<i>Just taking my supplements, that's all.</i>

45:47.396 --> 45:48.795
Supplements?

45:48.964 --> 45:53.560
A little steroidal cocktail for strength,
and some liquid kryptonite for-

45:54.069 --> 45:55.559
Well, just in case.

45:55.737 --> 45:57.102
How long-?

45:57.272 --> 45:59.206
Since the last week of the campaign.

45:59.374 --> 46:03.470
<i>It's given me boundless energy
and a clarity I never had before.</i>

46:03.645 --> 46:06.637
<i>- What about the meteor?
- The meteor's going to hit.</i>

46:06.815 --> 46:09.750
<i>It doesn't have to. There are other ways.</i>

46:09.918 --> 46:12.478
- That boy in Japan.
- I know all about him.

46:12.654 --> 46:14.053
<i>- I won't be needing him.
- But-</i>

46:14.222 --> 46:18.090
<i>Don't worry, Amanda,
everything's going to be fine.</i>

46:18.260 --> 46:21.559
<i>- "Fine"?
- I've come to realize that this meteor...</i>

46:21.730 --> 46:23.459
...is a gift from the heavens.

46:23.632 --> 46:27.159
<i>It's going to scourge the earth of millions,
maybe billions of people...</i>

46:27.336 --> 46:29.133
<i>...the planet couldn't sustain anyway.</i>

46:29.304 --> 46:32.205
The world that will spring
from the ashes will be a better one.

46:32.374 --> 46:33.739
Rational, orderly.

46:33.909 --> 46:35.672
And you know how I know that?

46:35.844 --> 46:38.711
<i>Because I'm going to build that world.</i>

46:38.880 --> 46:43.783
And, of course,
I intend for you to play a role in all this.

46:43.952 --> 46:47.649
A very important role.

46:49.424 --> 46:52.860
<i>Mr. President,
Hawkman and Captain Marvel are here.</i>

46:53.695 --> 46:56.095
<i>We'll talk more later.</i>

47:00.369 --> 47:03.338
Captain Marvel. Hawkman.
This is a surprise.

47:03.505 --> 47:05.939
<i>You wouldn't know
what happened to those fugitives...</i>

47:06.108 --> 47:07.632
...you were supposed to bring in?

47:08.276 --> 47:09.834
<i>They're right in front of you.</i>

47:14.983 --> 47:16.746
- How-?
- We had some help.

47:16.918 --> 47:19.011
<i>Give us all the data
you've got on the meteor.</i>

47:19.187 --> 47:21.485
- Hurry.
- Of course, of course.

47:29.865 --> 47:30.991
<i>What's wrong?</i>

47:31.166 --> 47:33.134
Feeling a little green at the gills?

47:34.302 --> 47:36.964
Well, well,
a bat by any other name...

47:37.139 --> 47:38.970
He said hurry, Luthor.

47:44.780 --> 47:47.248
<i>All right, all right. I'll tell you where it is.</i>

47:51.486 --> 47:53.750
<i>- Computer.
Yes, Mr. President?</i>

47:53.922 --> 47:55.389
Delete all files immediately.

47:55.557 --> 47:58.082
<i>Deleting. Deleting. Deleting.
- No!</i>

47:58.260 --> 48:00.888
<i>All files deleted.</i>

48:01.062 --> 48:05.931
<i>Aw. You two aren't going to be able
to save the world now.</i>

48:06.101 --> 48:07.864
<i>Well, I'll tell you something.</i>

48:08.036 --> 48:10.300
Everyone who lives see the new world...

48:10.472 --> 48:13.100
...will have learned
never to trust your kind again.

48:13.275 --> 48:14.435
Shut up.

48:20.515 --> 48:24.007
<i>Here. It's got all the information
you need on it.</i>

48:25.287 --> 48:27.016
Now go save us.

48:44.072 --> 48:45.471
Bitch.

48:46.241 --> 48:48.072
General, arrest him.

49:07.429 --> 49:08.794
<i>It's like the old saying.</i>

49:08.964 --> 49:13.594
If you want someone killed right,
you have to kill them yourself.

49:25.914 --> 49:28.246
Mr. President, are you all right?

49:28.750 --> 49:30.775
Mr. President.

49:37.859 --> 49:41.351
<i>I'm perfectly fine, as anyone can see.</i>

50:33.848 --> 50:37.284
- Where does a kid get this kind of money?
I had this kind of money.

50:37.452 --> 50:39.317
<i>Wasn't interested in toys, though.</i>

50:45.860 --> 50:47.691
Hey, guys. How did it go?

50:47.862 --> 50:49.261
Got everything we needed.

50:49.431 --> 50:52.127
Thanks again for your help
with Hawkman and Captain Marvel.

50:52.300 --> 50:54.632
<i>Wait a minute.
Why aren't you with the boy?</i>

50:54.803 --> 50:56.270
<i>I'm close enough right here.</i>

50:56.438 --> 50:58.702
<i>And he's not really that much of a boy,
you know?</i>

50:58.873 --> 51:00.807
<i>He's 13.</i>

51:05.580 --> 51:09.209
<i>He's down that way.
I'll just stay back here.</i>

51:23.365 --> 51:25.925
<i>Supes, Bats. Que pasta?</i>

51:26.101 --> 51:29.070
- Is it ready, Hiro?
- Toyman to you.

51:29.237 --> 51:31.797
<i>I got a copyright to protect.
And, yeah, it's ready.</i>

51:31.973 --> 51:34.942
- All I need is some numerals.
- Everything you need is in here.

51:35.110 --> 51:36.441
Excellent.

51:37.679 --> 51:41.115
<i>I'll input them,
and then it's blastoff time.</i>

51:42.517 --> 51:45.452
Hey, did you guys see Power Girl
when you came in?

51:45.620 --> 51:49.716
<i>If you see her again,
tell her I'm sorry about the X-ray goggles.</i>

51:50.425 --> 51:53.019
<i>I was just testing them, that's all.</i>

51:53.194 --> 51:55.924
Now I gotta rebuild them from scratch.

51:56.097 --> 51:59.965
Hiro- Uh, Toyman,
can we please see the rocket now?

52:00.135 --> 52:01.830
Sure, sure.

52:03.104 --> 52:04.503
<i>I didn't have a lot of time...</i>

52:04.673 --> 52:07.506
...so I based it on a design
I whipped up when I was 7.

52:08.677 --> 52:13.011
<i>That's why it has manual controls
even though it's not going to need a pilot.</i>

52:15.984 --> 52:17.849
Oh, one other thing.

52:18.019 --> 52:21.511
Back when I designed it,
I was way into hero worship.

52:27.095 --> 52:29.655
You are absolutely sure
this is going to work?

52:29.831 --> 52:32.766
Does Power Girl have big-?
- Just feed it the numbers, kid.

52:32.934 --> 52:34.595
You got it.

52:38.773 --> 52:40.741
Wow.

52:51.553 --> 52:53.282
<i>Who's there?</i>

53:03.031 --> 53:05.158
<i>Isn't there any way
to speed this up, Toyman?</i>

53:05.333 --> 53:07.995
Sure, go find
some other kid with a 210 IQ.

53:08.169 --> 53:10.000
And good luck with that.

53:18.813 --> 53:21.373
Hello, sunshine.

53:39.501 --> 53:41.196
Keep going.

54:04.092 --> 54:06.185
<i>I can't think of a morning...</i>

54:07.729 --> 54:11.688
<i>...I haven't woken up
with the thought of strangling you.</i>

54:14.636 --> 54:18.629
That sanctimonious image
of yours fooled everyone...

54:18.807 --> 54:20.104
...except me...

54:23.378 --> 54:28.338
...because I know evil.

54:41.963 --> 54:43.260
It had to be you...

54:43.431 --> 54:46.764
...the one other person in the world
smart enough to stop that meteor.

54:46.935 --> 54:50.427
<i>The only person smart enough.
You couldn't do it, remember?</i>

54:54.876 --> 54:57.504
What are you doing?
How am I gonna guide my rocket?

54:57.679 --> 54:59.203
<i>You're not going to.</i>

54:59.380 --> 55:01.974
<i>It's never going to take off.</i>

55:21.569 --> 55:23.059
Wait.

55:25.039 --> 55:26.267
What are you doing?

55:26.441 --> 55:28.500
<i>I'm going to fly this thing myself.</i>

55:28.676 --> 55:30.644
Are you crazy?

55:35.116 --> 55:37.141
Goodbye.

56:03.845 --> 56:05.472
You come to this planet...

56:05.647 --> 56:08.673
...declare yourself the savior of mankind.

56:08.850 --> 56:12.047
<i>Well, I think it's time you died
for your sins.</i>

57:04.906 --> 57:06.737
That was my best friend.

57:08.876 --> 57:10.537
And you just killed him.

58:46.841 --> 58:48.866
When does it end, Luthor?

58:54.649 --> 58:57.880
<i>I'll answer for you. It ends tonight.</i>

01:00:27.608 --> 01:00:30.975
<i>You can't touch me.
We're on American soil now.</i>

01:00:31.145 --> 01:00:34.603
And I am the president.

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:37.848
Consider yourself...

01:00:40.821 --> 01:00:43.449
- ... impeached.
- Yeah!

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:51.489
Superman.

01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:53.634
Looks like I recovered a little too late.

01:00:53.801 --> 01:00:56.201
Forget about that.
I got a message from Toyman.

01:00:56.637 --> 01:00:59.265
<i>He says that there's still a chance.</i>

01:01:13.154 --> 01:01:15.782
What are you doing? Stay back. Stop.

01:01:15.957 --> 01:01:19.893
<i>That's an order from the president!</i>

01:02:42.143 --> 01:02:45.635
The voice of the people
must be heard. I am the president!

01:02:46.647 --> 01:02:48.171
God bless America.

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:50.817
God bless me.

01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:59.084
<i>I have the feeling I'm not gonna have
to worry about that murder charge.</i>

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.728
Would have been
an interesting trial, though.

01:03:15.276 --> 01:03:17.676
Wanna stick around for a while?
Lois and I would-

01:03:17.845 --> 01:03:19.574
<i>I can't. It's late.</i>

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:21.480
"Late"?

01:03:25.986 --> 01:03:27.977
<i>Come on, it's...</i>

01:03:28.656 --> 01:03:30.487
...early.
