Don't just stand there like a stump!
Toss me some duct tape!

What do you
mean you used it up

00:11.832 --> 00:13.925
wrapping birthday presents
for your family?

00:14.018 --> 00:15.669
They're still a bunch of twigs!

00:15.821 --> 00:17.536
Perhaps I can help, Rocket.

00:20.962 --> 00:23.605
Whoa! Watch the fur, Warlock!

00:27.761 --> 00:30.176
Sorry. I was trying
to be useful.

00:30.453 --> 00:32.383
If you really wanna be useful,

00:32.430 --> 00:34.661
get me some krutackin' duct tape!

00:44.683 --> 00:47.320
This ship is much smaller
than I remembered, Gamora.

00:47.418 --> 00:50.545
Not surprising. The last time you
were here, you were just a baby.

00:50.622 --> 00:53.095
There was much spitting up
and changing of diapers.

00:53.250 --> 00:56.465
Oh, don't remind me, Drax. We finally
got the smell out of the cushions.

00:56.862 --> 00:58.641
So, Adam,
I've been meaning to ask.

00:58.847 --> 01:01.057
What have you been up to
since the last time we saw you?

01:01.303 --> 01:03.138
I traversed the galaxy,
Peter Quill,

01:03.297 --> 01:05.084
seeking meaning and purpose.

01:05.196 --> 01:07.507
At first,
all I could see was chaos.

01:07.562 --> 01:10.439

my true path.

01:10.534 --> 01:12.410
This I gotta hear.

01:12.608 --> 01:14.698
I have been purging
the galaxy of darkness

01:14.745 --> 01:18.646

evildoers into my cosmic gem.

pure good will illuminate this universe.

Some said it was impossible

06:09.995 --> 06:11.410

06:49.484 --> 06:52.193

Groot can evolve your family.

07:44.119 --> 07:46.245
Oh, this just gets
better and better!

Warlock, if this is a joke,
I ain't laughin'!

07:57.789 --> 08:00.840
And you won't neither
when I get my paws on you!

08:08.982 --> 08:11.208
Is it just me, or are
these family get-togethers

08:11.256 --> 08:13.884
never as warm and fuzzy
as I pictured?

08:17.300 --> 08:19.041
Huh? Now what?

08:19.153 --> 08:21.075
Wait. I know that ship.

08:21.148 --> 08:23.298
That's the
High Evolutionary's ship.

08:23.388 --> 08:25.587
Which means this shindig
just got upgraded

08:25.635 --> 08:28.153
from failure
to total catastrophe!

09:01.815 --> 09:05.086
Whoa. Looks like
Warlock wasn't kiddin'

09:05.189 --> 09:07.208
when he said he was
ridding the galaxy of evil.

09:10.024 --> 09:11.358
Ugh.

09:13.518 --> 09:15.671
What have we here?

09:15.806 --> 09:18.883
A breathtaking work
of genetic art.

09:23.529 --> 09:26.227
Great. So now I'm stranded
here with these losers

09:26.326 --> 09:29.210
and that genetics-crazed
nutjob...

09:29.294 --> 09:31.590
who could be the only
person in the universe

09:31.643 --> 09:34.148
that could actually re-evolve
my family.

09:34.325 --> 09:36.396

09:38.876 --> 09:42.641

09:53.012 --> 09:56.820
The only thing you create is a sick
feeling in the pit of my stomach.

09:57.016 --> 10:00.233
You! What are you doing here?

10:00.408 --> 10:03.776
And why did you bring
these... vermin?

10:03.911 --> 10:07.741
What? Ya think I brung 'em here
just so you could re-evolve 'em?

10:07.789 --> 10:10.483
Ha! Like you could
actually do that.

10:10.657 --> 10:13.216

10:13.381 --> 10:16.282
Hey, these ain't just
any ordinary vermin.

evolved and devolved

by the greatest minds
on Halfworld.

10:20.596 --> 10:24.173

no one could figure it out.

10:24.208 --> 10:26.543
Not even you, Chrome-Dome.

10:26.772 --> 10:30.172
Hmm. It could be
an interesting challenge.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.341
Sort of a genetic
found art piece.

10:33.479 --> 10:36.763
But no. I'd need something
more from you in return.

10:36.911 --> 10:40.334
And unfortunately,
your DNA is of no use to me.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.582
Not interested? Eh, fine.

10:42.741 --> 10:45.171

10:45.218 --> 10:48.625

10:49.374 --> 10:51.897

10:52.080 --> 10:54.047

10:54.095 --> 10:56.073

for an artist like me,

10:56.193 --> 10:59.916

this limited genetic palette?

11:00.166 --> 11:04.659
I need color. I need variety!
I need inspiration!

11:04.921 --> 11:06.614
Not my problem.

11:06.922 --> 11:10.888
But I do know a guy who can get us
outta here, and you know the price.

11:10.976 --> 11:14.118
Evolving your family?
Child's play.

11:14.624 --> 11:18.397
Come! We must fetch
my lab equipment.

11:19.677 --> 11:20.759
Whoa!

11:20.814 --> 11:22.934
Warlock's crazy plan
might actually work!

11:23.107 --> 11:25.249
But that'd mean
he's actually right.

11:25.297 --> 11:27.215
So...
no, it can't work.

11:29.966 --> 11:31.798
Has anyone seen Adam?

11:31.910 --> 11:35.262
Nope. Well, come to think of it,
I haven't seen Rocket either.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.399
I am Groot!

11:37.494 --> 11:40.453
Yeah, we know Rocket's missing.
Try to keep up.

11:40.583 --> 11:43.033

11:43.334 --> 11:47.545

Wait. What do you need
the lizard for?

12:02.646 --> 12:05.818
I'll need a massive amount of
life energy to fix your family.

12:05.984 --> 12:08.592
Unless, of course,
you have an objection.

12:08.779 --> 12:10.942
Eh, do what you gotta do.

12:25.292 --> 12:27.802
Aahh!

12:32.331 --> 12:35.097

it's for my own family.

12:46.232 --> 12:47.892
We've arrived at Halfworld.

12:47.955 --> 12:49.875
But how will we find Warlock?

12:51.981 --> 12:53.691
Found him!

12:56.644 --> 12:58.377
Aaahhh!

13:01.744 --> 13:03.763
What is he doing?

13:04.225 --> 13:06.735
He appears to greatly
dislike those rocks.

13:06.973 --> 13:09.975
Stay back! I can't control it!

13:10.023 --> 13:14.062
I absorbed Rocket, and I don't
want to absorb you too!

13:15.054 --> 13:16.284
Aaahh!

13:16.418 --> 13:19.002
The darkness...
It's seeping out of me!

13:19.158 --> 13:22.173
I cannot keep it in!

13:25.349 --> 13:27.874
We've got to stop him
before he hurts himself.

13:27.983 --> 13:30.957
Really? He's the guy you're
worried about getting hurt?

13:31.435 --> 13:33.049
I am Groot!

13:33.524 --> 13:36.202
No! I said stay back!

13:43.790 --> 13:45.567
I am Groot?

13:54.434 --> 13:56.935
I need more energy.

14:07.729 --> 14:08.961
I am Groot!

14:09.101 --> 14:12.406
- Groot! How'd you find me?
- I am Groot!

14:12.629 --> 14:16.885
What? Just 'cause something goes boom
don't mean it's... Okay, it's usually me.

14:17.118 --> 14:19.452
- I am Groot?
- My family?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.940
They're getting fixed
by the High Evolutionary.

14:22.115 --> 14:24.458
But I couldn't stand to watch.

14:24.957 --> 14:26.866
Rerouting circuits.

14:34.978 --> 14:36.496
I thought I was good enough!

14:36.678 --> 14:38.911
I thought I could
control the evil!

14:39.033 --> 14:41.222
How could I have been so wrong?

14:44.513 --> 14:46.300
Adam, you've got to fight it.

14:47.488 --> 14:49.843
The evil within
me is too strong!

14:52.123 --> 14:55.204
I can feel it... the darkness!

15:03.655 --> 15:05.430
Forgive me, my friends.

15:05.517 --> 15:08.459
I can't control the darkness
within me!

15:13.136 --> 15:14.802
Not cool, Adam!

15:16.981 --> 15:19.078
Everyone, fall back!

15:19.192 --> 15:21.308
Drax the Destroyer
does not fall back!

15:27.094 --> 15:28.133
Usually.

15:32.662 --> 15:35.527
So, you brought me another specimen.
Excellent!

15:35.653 --> 15:38.286
I've been wanting to create
with more of his DNA.

15:38.454 --> 15:40.255
I am Groot!

15:42.291 --> 15:45.213
What'd you do that for? He was in
the middle of fixing my family.

15:45.324 --> 15:47.097
I am Groot!

15:47.150 --> 15:50.153
What do you mean the gecko's pain
is causing Warlock to go dark?

15:50.338 --> 15:52.284
I am Groot!

15:52.511 --> 15:54.557
So we stop Warlock
from hurting our friends

15:54.605 --> 15:56.669
after my family gets re-evolved!

15:56.796 --> 15:58.688
I am Groot!

15:58.818 --> 16:01.572
It ain't fair!
You get your people back.

16:01.715 --> 16:05.322
I was almost starting to have hope,
and now you wanna take it away?

16:05.951 --> 16:07.738
I am Groot.

16:21.173 --> 16:22.414
I am Groot!

16:26.096 --> 16:27.786
I am Groot?

16:27.897 --> 16:29.637
What? Just 'cause
my hackles are up

16:29.685 --> 16:31.405
don't mean I wanna see ya
get torched again.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.007
I... I am Groot.

16:34.158 --> 16:38.393
Yeah, I get it. You wanna make nice
to Foomy so's Warlock can calm down.

16:38.537 --> 16:40.235
But I got a better idea.

16:44.988 --> 16:47.266
If we really wanna help Goldie
restore his inner balance,

16:47.345 --> 16:50.805
we gotta irritate him until
he purges us from his system.

16:51.781 --> 16:53.489
I am Groot?

16:54.158 --> 16:56.954
Trust me, there's nothing
better than a good purge.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.811
Rodents do it all the time.

16:58.905 --> 17:01.024
Not that'd I know anything about that!

17:04.626 --> 17:06.549
Guys, this way!

17:08.867 --> 17:11.356
Figures. They
never listen to anyone.

17:12.258 --> 17:15.025
I am Groot!

17:18.364 --> 17:20.305
Show-off.

17:24.171 --> 17:27.872
- We gotta annoy him more!
- I am Groot?

17:28.182 --> 17:30.431
Have you met
my krutackin' family?

17:30.503 --> 17:31.814
Just follow my lead.

17:31.889 --> 17:34.690
Hey, Ma, how's about a hug
for your little runt?

17:51.023 --> 17:53.774
That's it! Just keep being
your usual annoying selves!

17:54.004 --> 17:57.050
Nothing worse than having
wild rodents in your armpits!

17:59.065 --> 18:00.996
Aaahhh!

18:01.194 --> 18:04.187
The pain! Make it stop!

18:10.777 --> 18:13.144
It's working! We gotta
head toward that portal!

18:13.415 --> 18:15.406
I am Groot!

18:28.892 --> 18:32.335
Can't hold it in!

18:39.835 --> 18:41.525
This looks like our stop.

18:46.524 --> 18:48.183
Rocket! Groot!

18:54.770 --> 18:56.914
Finally, out of that accursed...

18:56.969 --> 19:01.148
Wait. What's this? It's him!

19:02.310 --> 19:04.604
The portrait
of genetic perfection!

19:05.239 --> 19:06.887
Forget the dragon.

19:07.091 --> 19:10.087
I want the Warlock!

19:10.293 --> 19:12.287
Let's move this party
somewhere else.

19:16.691 --> 19:18.398
Come on, Adam!

19:20.774 --> 19:23.568
Go on. There is no hope for me.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.635
There's always hope.

19:39.154 --> 19:41.011
Especially 'cause
I rigged the ship to blow up

19:41.059 --> 19:43.711
while Chrome-Dome
was experimenting on my family.

19:43.878 --> 19:46.651
Like I said,
always prepare for the worst.

19:46.860 --> 19:48.919
That's why you put
erasers on pencils

19:48.986 --> 19:51.157
and escape pods on spaceships.

19:51.284 --> 19:52.888
I am Groot.

19:53.049 --> 19:56.566
I know that also
means the bad guys got away.

19:56.844 --> 19:59.546
With any luck, the dragon'll
have 'em for breakfast.

20:03.218 --> 20:06.116
Rocket, I'm sorry
I could not help your family.

20:06.243 --> 20:08.736
I was wrong
to give you false hope.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.852
Nah, you were right.

20:11.046 --> 20:13.751
Not about my family,
but about hope.

20:13.907 --> 20:17.437
Just 'cause you expect the worst don't
mean you can't still hope for the best.

20:21.156 --> 20:24.151
My family may still be a bunch
of feral garbage pickers,

20:24.421 --> 20:25.804
but they're good people.

20:26.077 --> 20:27.597
And I'm gonna miss 'em
when we go.

20:30.209 --> 20:32.248
I am Groot.

20:33.234 --> 20:35.163
What do you mean,
they don't want to leave you?

20:35.211 --> 20:39.262
They can't stay with us. It's too
dangerous. Especially for me.

20:39.881 --> 20:41.351
I am Groot!

20:50.916 --> 20:53.873
This was an
inspired idea, Groot.

20:54.322 --> 20:58.242
Rocket's family will be safe and happy
here among your people and the Klyntar.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.852
Yeah, it's great... for them.

21:01.930 --> 21:04.831
What about me?
I still got nothin'.

21:08.288 --> 21:10.486
Ma, no! Not again!

21:17.790 --> 21:20.477
I am Groot?

21:24.754 --> 21:27.934
Like I said,
they're good people.

21:28.250 --> 21:32.281
