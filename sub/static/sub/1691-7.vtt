[Sniffs]

00:38.310 --> 00:39.879
Once again...

00:40.427 --> 00:43.518
I do <i> all</i> the talking.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.369
That's the only way this works.

00:46.589 --> 00:48.228
[Telephone rings in distance]

[Indistinct conversations]

00:50.203 --> 00:52.074
[Footsteps approaching]

00:56.995 --> 00:57.921
Hand it over.

00:58.146 --> 01:00.202
- Now, before <i> that</i> happens...
- Hand it over.

01:00.239 --> 01:02.383
No. Hey. I've got it right here.

01:03.089 --> 01:04.177
Is this it?

01:05.418 --> 01:07.322
I'll... I will take that as a "yes."

01:07.365 --> 01:10.265
[Chuckles] Very well. Mystery solved.

01:10.462 --> 01:12.065
You know, I could take
you into custody right now,

01:12.096 --> 01:13.036
you son of a bitch.

01:13.743 --> 01:16.090
- Both of you.
- Whoa, whoa. Where's this coming from?

01:16.127 --> 01:18.991
You're the one who spilled the coffee,
you ambulance-chasing piece of shit!

01:19.003 --> 01:22.327
Can we dial it down,
you know, just a notch?

01:22.959 --> 01:26.640
Look, 45 minutes ago, I'm sound asleep.

01:27.107 --> 01:29.398
I get a call from Mr. Ehrmantraut.

01:29.552 --> 01:30.866
He's concerned.

01:30.986 --> 01:33.501
He's getting threatening
voicemails from you

01:33.534 --> 01:35.632
accusing him of petty theft.

01:35.752 --> 01:36.770
I tell him,

01:37.133 --> 01:38.792
"hey, we're gonna nip this in the bud.

01:38.829 --> 01:40.905
I don't care what the hell
time it is. We're gonna

01:40.958 --> 01:42.689
go talk this thing out."

01:42.690 --> 01:45.876
And walking across the parking
lot, just now... boom...

01:46.297 --> 01:48.339
there's a notepad, plain as day,

01:48.382 --> 01:51.098
lying on the asphalt,
where I can only surmise

01:51.147 --> 01:54.303
you accidentally dropped
it, Detective. Now,

01:54.926 --> 01:57.635
guys, that's... that's all we know.

02:00.561 --> 02:02.485
Let me tell you something, Slick...

02:02.812 --> 02:05.547
- wait till I get you back to Philadelphia.
- I'm confused.

02:05.578 --> 02:07.490
The state of Pennsylvania
can extradite people

02:07.506 --> 02:10.056
for returning lost property? Wow,

02:10.079 --> 02:12.460
that is one bold legislature.

02:13.157 --> 02:16.276
Anything you want to say to me
about what you found in here? Hmm?

02:16.396 --> 02:18.257
Now that it's all out in the open?

02:19.830 --> 02:21.590
Maybe your daughter-in-law...

02:21.916 --> 02:23.633
maybe she's got something to tell me.

02:23.753 --> 02:24.939
Maybe.

02:26.921 --> 02:27.742
Maybe not.

02:27.749 --> 02:29.132
Yeah, we'll see.

02:29.677 --> 02:31.228
First thing tomorrow...

02:31.966 --> 02:33.452
I mean, you got to figure
she wouldn't reach out to us

02:33.489 --> 02:34.933
if she had nothing to say.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.697
Hopefully, whatever you are

02:38.091 --> 02:40.315
didn't rub off on the rest of your family.

02:52.363 --> 02:53.293
Thanks.

02:53.413 --> 02:55.308
You're welcome. Let's
get the hell out of here.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.479
No, I mean "thanks,"
as in "three's a crowd."

02:58.599 --> 03:00.021
You can go now.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.211
You're not talking to my client without me.

03:04.331 --> 03:05.838
Yeah, he is.

03:06.274 --> 03:07.694
Please leave now.

03:10.483 --> 03:12.167
[Sighs]

03:14.336 --> 03:15.731
[Smacks lips]

03:19.890 --> 03:21.986
Ooh. Oh, man.

03:22.299 --> 03:23.890
You ever have jet lag?

03:24.010 --> 03:27.043
[Sniffs] I guess that's
what this is. [Grunts]

03:27.522 --> 03:28.862
Maybe it's the altitude, huh?

03:30.693 --> 03:32.040
[Sighs]

03:34.692 --> 03:36.572
Could be the altitude.

03:37.806 --> 03:39.742
We're a mile up, right?

03:40.327 --> 03:41.954
[Sighs]

03:45.082 --> 03:46.623
Sorry about the kid.

03:47.274 --> 03:49.665
He's young, looking to make his mark.

03:52.368 --> 03:53.867
I like him.

03:57.584 --> 04:00.235
Your daughter-in-law... what...

04:00.723 --> 04:02.352
what's she gonna tell us?

04:05.031 --> 04:06.923
I don't honestly know.

04:10.492 --> 04:12.563
Well, Mike, if she's got nothing to say,

04:12.882 --> 04:14.719
this pretty well ends it here.

04:17.248 --> 04:20.495
So maybe you should
talk to her before we do.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.234
I talked.

04:24.088 --> 04:27.585
If I were to guess, I'd say
she wouldn't tell you much.

04:28.679 --> 04:29.914
But...

04:31.628 --> 04:33.822
Either way, that's up to her.

04:35.933 --> 04:37.754
That's the least I owe her.

04:42.273 --> 04:43.695
There's a lot of people we both know

04:43.732 --> 04:46.023
that think that Fensky got
what was coming to him...

04:46.306 --> 04:47.996
Hoffman, too.

04:48.543 --> 04:50.564
That whole precinct was a sewer.

04:52.983 --> 04:54.588
Wouldn't be surprised if there's

04:54.612 --> 04:56.683
a few more early retirements.

04:57.822 --> 05:00.148
Might be a good thing... new blood.

05:05.856 --> 05:07.392
Like the kid.

05:09.250 --> 05:10.268
Yeah.

05:11.816 --> 05:12.990
He's all right.

05:14.784 --> 05:16.713
He's just got to learn, that's all.

05:18.537 --> 05:21.136

Let's go,

06:06.315 --> 06:08.650
word for word, verbatim,
while it's still fresh.

06:08.711 --> 06:11.679
What I said is none of your concern.

06:12.365 --> 06:13.952
I was speaking to a friend.

06:14.072 --> 06:15.525
[Chuckles] You were speaking

06:15.645 --> 06:18.463
to a homicide detective
who flew 2,000 miles

06:18.487 --> 06:20.208
to investigate a double murder

06:20.226 --> 06:22.782
for which you are
clearly the prime suspect.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.179
How could you not recognize the
mind games, the scams, the...

06:26.953 --> 06:29.060
the con jobs these people play?

06:29.084 --> 06:31.438
You used to be one of
them. So what got said?

06:31.487 --> 06:33.588
Right now, come on. I'm serious.

06:33.619 --> 06:35.057
I know you're trying to help me,

06:35.118 --> 06:37.668
- but you can't go...
- Look, no, I'm trying to help <i> me.</i>

06:37.865 --> 06:39.372
Those two Philly cheesesteaks...

06:39.395 --> 06:41.644
they want to lock me
up right alongside you.

06:41.764 --> 06:44.390
So, work with me here, for the both of us.

06:44.450 --> 06:46.190
You're safe, Counselor,

06:46.467 --> 06:49.133
and I no longer require your services.

06:49.169 --> 06:50.853
You're... you're kidding, right?

06:50.973 --> 06:53.243
What... y... you think
you're gonna defend yourself?

06:53.673 --> 06:55.673
It's in someone else's hands.

06:55.921 --> 06:57.721
- What... like God?
- No.

06:57.841 --> 07:00.659
Please don't say Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.

07:00.847 --> 07:03.981
I appreciate your help. Go home. Go to bed.

07:04.017 --> 07:05.231
Send me your bill.

07:05.261 --> 07:07.018
- [Car door closes]
- Oh, I'm sending you my bill.

07:07.503 --> 07:09.257
[Engine turns over] I'm sending...

- What the hell was that?

What the hell was that?

08:21.227 --> 08:22.476

08:22.763 --> 08:24.165
Ohh.

08:24.285 --> 08:25.605

08:25.854 --> 08:27.505
Okay.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.126
Okay.

08:30.937 --> 08:32.659
It's an experiment, really.

08:32.967 --> 08:34.522
I've been attempting

08:34.642 --> 08:37.312
to build up a tolerance
for electromagnetic fields.

08:37.355 --> 08:39.109
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

08:39.229 --> 08:40.559
Yeah, it's like, um,

08:40.679 --> 08:44.222
you know, like taking small doses of poison

08:44.343 --> 08:45.751
to build up an immunity.

08:46.105 --> 08:47.584
Yeah, well, is that a real thing?

08:47.593 --> 08:49.990
'Cause that does <i> not</i>
sound like a real thing.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.410
It's a real thing.

08:51.821 --> 08:54.549
Anyway, as you well know,

08:54.820 --> 08:57.026
there is a 60-kilovolt transformer

08:57.046 --> 09:00.061
200 meters south-southwest
of my front yard.

09:00.288 --> 09:02.245
And I've been trying
to get acclimated to it.

09:02.685 --> 09:04.234
I got up to two minutes today.

09:04.473 --> 09:06.562
- Jesus, Chuck.
- [Chuckling] Yeah.

09:06.617 --> 09:08.749
Two days ago, I could
barely stand 30 seconds.

09:08.792 --> 09:11.016
I'm trying to get up to
five minutes by next week.

09:12.060 --> 09:13.467
That is just...

09:14.364 --> 09:15.780
Uh, but why now?

09:15.796 --> 09:18.548
Well, after what happened with the police

09:19.058 --> 09:20.243
and the hospital,

09:20.570 --> 09:22.682
I almost lost everything, Jimmy.

09:23.573 --> 09:25.152
I can't go on like this.

09:25.349 --> 09:27.874
I have to find a way to get better.

09:28.341 --> 09:29.257
I've got to.

09:29.453 --> 09:30.952
I have to get back to work.

09:31.072 --> 09:32.365
Sitting here,

09:32.728 --> 09:34.054
rotting away...

09:34.834 --> 09:37.405
this is no kind of life
for me... for anyone.

09:37.525 --> 09:39.535
I need to be useful again.

- Chuck...

09:43.399 --> 09:45.918
I am so proud of you.

09:45.965 --> 09:47.283
Oh. [Chuckles]

09:48.174 --> 09:49.986
It'll be a long process,

09:50.883 --> 09:53.255
but one to which I'm very much committed.

09:54.281 --> 09:55.569
I have to be.

09:59.174 --> 10:01.205
God, I... I'll be right back.

10:01.242 --> 10:03.098
I got to get a few more
things out of the car.

10:03.104 --> 10:04.511
All right.

10:13.232 --> 10:15.102
[Laughing] All right.

10:19.802 --> 10:21.045
What's all this?

10:21.097 --> 10:23.470
It's just some case files.
I'm out of room at the office.

10:23.495 --> 10:24.889
I don't want to leave them in the car.

10:25.319 --> 10:27.051
There's a lot of sensitive information.

10:27.103 --> 10:29.203
Y... you're not planning
to leave them here.

10:30.481 --> 10:32.390
Yeah, I don't know, Jimmy.

10:32.442 --> 10:34.217
It'll just be for a little while, okay?

10:34.241 --> 10:36.933
I'm practically sleeping on
these things back at my place.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.230
Business is that good?

10:39.282 --> 10:42.056
[Chuckles] It's booming streets of gold.

10:42.452 --> 10:45.335
Yeah. I'll get these out
of here as quick as I can.

10:45.349 --> 10:48.040
I just need to file the
4-13s on some of these wills,

10:48.071 --> 10:50.264
and, uh, I'll be out of your hair.

10:50.313 --> 10:51.290
4-13s?

10:51.573 --> 10:53.378
Personal property statements.

10:53.446 --> 10:55.443
- You mean 5-13s.
- Yeah.

10:55.473 --> 10:57.762
Sorry. I was just working
with these seniors.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.227
Maybe the dementia's
contagious, huh? [Chuckles]

11:00.586 --> 11:01.962
Uh-huh.

11:02.082 --> 11:04.387
- Uh...
- [clears throat] So, uh,

11:04.507 --> 11:05.803
we good here?

11:06.110 --> 11:07.746
See you tomorrow. Same time.

11:52.076 --> 11:53.856
Here you go. Just bring
them back when you're done.

11:53.871 --> 11:54.834
You got it.

- Why do you sound surprised?
- Not...

surprised, no. Just,

12:04.634 --> 12:06.571
you know, could you afford this?

12:06.644 --> 12:08.772
[Chuckling] Oh, yeah. Are you kidding?

12:09.205 --> 12:11.224
Those seniors have been very good to me.

- I've been meaning to expand, you know?

12:28.257 --> 12:30.211
[Elevator doors open]

12:31.727 --> 12:33.342
[Lock turns, door opens]

12:33.785 --> 12:34.739
[Chuckles]

12:35.633 --> 12:37.113
Wow.

12:37.400 --> 12:39.183
It's a clean slate. [Sighs]

12:39.235 --> 12:41.451
Put the, uh, reception desk right here.

12:41.453 --> 12:44.188
Uh, get some comfortable
seating for the clients.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.835
I... it's big... lot of offices.

12:47.243 --> 12:49.008
Yeah, I like the openness.

12:49.293 --> 12:51.603
I feel like I can
breathe in here, you know?

12:51.723 --> 12:52.670
It's not some

12:53.029 --> 12:56.218
claustrophobic, little closet
that smells like acetone.

12:56.291 --> 12:57.127
[Chuckles]

12:57.378 --> 12:58.759
Room to grow.

12:59.461 --> 13:01.304
Dream big, I say.

13:01.702 --> 13:02.538
[Clicks tongue]

13:02.875 --> 13:04.651
Got a decent-size conference room...

13:04.671 --> 13:07.797
not as big as Hamlin's, but, you know,

13:07.856 --> 13:11.749
it's cozy. Our elderly
brethren prefer that, I find.

13:11.789 --> 13:13.344
Yeah. Could be cozier, though.

13:13.347 --> 13:15.392
Maybe you could embroider
some little cushions,

13:15.686 --> 13:17.511
crochet a runner for the table.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.022
- And rocking chairs all around?
- Yes.

13:20.142 --> 13:22.657
Make it look like the front
of a cracker barrel, huh?

13:22.777 --> 13:24.628
- [Both chuckle]
- Now you're talking.

13:24.633 --> 13:26.034
This is me.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.671
[Sighs]

13:28.143 --> 13:29.981
[Chuckling] I love it.

13:31.210 --> 13:33.795
Got to look successful to <i>
be</i> successful. Am I right?

13:33.839 --> 13:37.004
Well, this definitely
looks like success. [Laughs]

13:37.196 --> 13:38.537
Great view.

13:39.191 --> 13:40.961
Get you a big, fancy desk in here.

13:41.015 --> 13:42.554
Cocobolo desk.

13:42.602 --> 13:43.305
A what?

13:43.497 --> 13:45.680
I don't know what it means,
but I just like saying the word

13:45.729 --> 13:46.947
"cocobolo."

13:47.420 --> 13:49.085
Okay, well, whatever it is,

13:49.557 --> 13:50.659
you deserve it.

13:53.081 --> 13:55.416
And, uh, I want you to see this one.

14:01.421 --> 14:02.610
Here we are.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.270
[Chuckles] Whoa.

14:07.486 --> 14:10.303
This is way better than the other one.

14:10.563 --> 14:12.549
- You think?
- Uh, yeah.

14:12.573 --> 14:13.487
Who goes in here?

14:13.497 --> 14:16.475
'Cause I'd be all up in here if I were you.

14:17.394 --> 14:19.228
Yeah. [Inhales sharply]

14:19.348 --> 14:22.934
Yeah, you know, you're
right. It is real nice.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.111
It's a corner office. You got
to go with the corner office.

14:25.291 --> 14:26.606
Eh, I was saving it for someone.

14:26.630 --> 14:28.424
- Who?
- Well, my partner.

14:28.488 --> 14:30.145
Your partner? Who's...

14:31.216 --> 14:32.303
[Chuckles]

14:32.637 --> 14:33.841
Who would that be?

14:35.488 --> 14:38.453
Well, you said you were
interested in elder law.

14:39.096 --> 14:40.083
That's...

14:40.301 --> 14:41.491
That is so...

14:41.840 --> 14:42.719
[chuckles]

14:42.774 --> 14:43.594
Thank you.

14:44.032 --> 14:44.828
Really.

14:45.695 --> 14:48.805
But you know I've got
a lot invested at HHM.

14:48.925 --> 14:50.545
With what's going on now,

14:50.584 --> 14:52.117
I... I'm closer than ever to partner...

14:52.151 --> 14:53.985
like, maybe two years, and I'm in.

14:54.339 --> 14:55.592
[Chuckling] Yeah, I know.

14:56.418 --> 14:57.882
Yeah, it's...

14:58.579 --> 15:00.364
- it's just a thought.
- Plus,

15:00.690 --> 15:02.980
you know, they put me through law school.

15:02.995 --> 15:04.190
I feel like I owe them.

15:04.310 --> 15:05.928
Actually, I <i> do</i> owe them...

15:06.120 --> 15:07.673
literally, you know?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.821
But it's a nice thought, Jimmy.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.722
Just, uh, you know,

15:13.120 --> 15:14.309
playing with ideas.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.063
So, I had the extra office
and everything, so...

15:16.078 --> 15:17.554
Yeah. No, I get it. It's...

15:22.204 --> 15:25.512
I... want to see the kitchen.

15:30.606 --> 15:32.428
- Wow!
- [Sighs]

15:32.811 --> 15:35.078
They have stainless in here.

15:35.442 --> 15:37.307
I don't even have stainless at home.

15:44.016 --> 15:46.065
Kim: I know this is the
last thing you want to hear.

15:47.057 --> 15:49.229
I think your chances of
getting a favorable ruling

15:49.238 --> 15:50.865
from a jury are very slim.

15:53.677 --> 15:55.004
Mr. Kettleman: What does that mean?

15:55.124 --> 15:57.166
We're not in a great
position to win at trial.

15:57.377 --> 15:58.744
But we came to you people

15:58.773 --> 16:00.818
because we were told you win cases.

16:01.108 --> 16:02.081
Winning doesn't always mean

16:02.111 --> 16:03.580
getting a favorable verdict at trial.

16:03.605 --> 16:05.418
We try to achieve the best possible outcome

16:05.458 --> 16:07.876
for our clients, given
each individual case.

16:09.616 --> 16:12.468
Frankly, we've worked very
hard to stave off an arrest.

16:12.588 --> 16:15.329
After the misunderstanding about your, uh,

16:15.506 --> 16:18.804
camping trip, the D.A. was
concerned you might be a flight risk.

16:18.814 --> 16:20.937
[Scoffs] A flight risk? We...

16:21.207 --> 16:23.680
we were practically in
our own backyard. [Laughs]

16:23.800 --> 16:25.429
That's exactly what we told the D.A.

16:25.848 --> 16:28.139
In any case, I think we've
managed to come up with a deal

16:28.139 --> 16:30.223
- that is very favorable under the circumstances.
- A deal?

16:30.277 --> 16:31.353
I hate that terminology.

16:31.372 --> 16:32.621
A deal is what they got O.J.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.729
- Well, Betsy, maybe we should, you know, hear it.
- I'm just saying, it's terrible term.

16:35.553 --> 16:37.460
What kind of... deal?

16:38.519 --> 16:40.528
If the prosecution decides to file,

16:40.685 --> 16:42.565
which is definitely the
direction this seems to be headed,

16:42.569 --> 16:44.295
and if they choose to stack charges,

16:44.415 --> 16:45.077
Craig,

16:45.289 --> 16:47.094
you're looking at 30 years in prison.

16:47.436 --> 16:48.309
30 years?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.574
That's the maximum, and
given the nature of the charge

16:50.586 --> 16:52.005
and the current political environment,

16:52.013 --> 16:53.407
I'd say we should expect it.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.391
The public outcry in

16:55.511 --> 16:57.510
cases like these is a big factor.

16:58.662 --> 17:01.304
However, after much
discussion with the D.A.,

17:01.424 --> 17:04.335
who is also invested in
keeping the press to a minimum,

17:04.834 --> 17:06.371
we have arrived at an arrangement,

17:06.646 --> 17:09.305
which would include 16
months in a county facility.

17:09.337 --> 17:10.670
16 months.

17:11.342 --> 17:12.925
Down from 30 years.

17:13.445 --> 17:15.027
And you most likely
wouldn't serve all of it.

17:15.321 --> 17:17.515
But he would have to say he was guilty.

17:18.074 --> 17:19.749
Admitting wrongdoing and

17:19.797 --> 17:22.038
making the county whole
again goes a long way here...

17:22.066 --> 17:25.326
- hence the minimal sentence.
- Uh, "making the county whole again"?

17:25.348 --> 17:28.723
It includes the stipulation
that you return $1.6 million

17:28.728 --> 17:30.167
in misappropriated funds.

17:30.195 --> 17:31.627
- Give back the money?
- But there is no money.

17:31.630 --> 17:33.852
- There's no money.
- We told you... Craig is innocent.

17:34.792 --> 17:35.774
I understand.

17:36.384 --> 17:37.082
However,

17:37.242 --> 17:39.189
I'd like to emphasize again that

17:39.251 --> 17:42.415
this deal is Craig's best
chance of minimizing jail time.

17:42.535 --> 17:43.792
You're telling us

17:44.012 --> 17:46.217
there are drug dealers and murderers

17:46.241 --> 17:47.283
walking the streets,

17:47.546 --> 17:48.706
but instead of going after them,

17:48.734 --> 17:50.487
they want to put an innocent man in jail.

17:50.515 --> 17:52.528
There's no other... way?

17:52.838 --> 17:54.994
I'm sorry. I think,
under the circumstances,

17:55.076 --> 17:56.032
this is your best option.

17:56.051 --> 17:58.792
Murderers and rapists,
and this is how they tr...

17:58.804 --> 17:59.747
[inhales sharply]

18:00.577 --> 18:02.358
Okay. There is no money.

18:02.586 --> 18:03.542
There never was.

18:03.577 --> 18:05.437
- You have to take this to trial.
- Look,

18:06.031 --> 18:07.599
you have a difficult,

18:08.127 --> 18:10.856
but nevertheless straightforward
choice to make here.

18:11.886 --> 18:13.825
- On one hand, you give up the money,
- Ah!

18:13.891 --> 18:15.872
- plead...
- I just told you... there is no money.

18:15.892 --> 18:16.899
... plead guilty...

18:17.560 --> 18:18.665
it's painful, I know...

18:19.924 --> 18:21.430
and go to jail for a year and a half.

18:21.508 --> 18:22.818
But your other choice...

18:23.238 --> 18:24.559
that is no choice at all.

18:26.187 --> 18:28.419
If you go to trial,
you'll most likely lose,

18:28.455 --> 18:30.973
and Craig goes to prison for decades.

18:31.464 --> 18:33.174
Your children will grow up seeing their dad

18:33.198 --> 18:35.089
through bars on visiting day.

18:37.771 --> 18:38.801
I know what I'd do.

18:40.192 --> 18:41.454
I'd take the deal.

18:43.125 --> 18:44.946
Two years from now, you
can be starting over.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.364
It's tough, I know...

18:48.779 --> 18:49.982
But you're tough people.

18:50.804 --> 18:53.662
And your family is worth it.

18:58.420 --> 19:00.524
Why don't I give you a few
moments to discuss this?

19:00.555 --> 19:02.120
I know it's a big decision.

19:02.155 --> 19:03.579
We don't need to discuss it.

19:04.106 --> 19:05.349
[Chuckles]

19:06.414 --> 19:07.299
You're fired.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.178
How about we go to <i> my</i>
office and discuss this?

19:12.190 --> 19:13.393
I'm sure there's a solution.

19:13.409 --> 19:14.514
That won't be necessary.

19:14.525 --> 19:16.047
We will no longer be
requiring your services.

19:16.063 --> 19:17.424
Yeah, it's not personal, really.

19:17.427 --> 19:19.429
If you're unhappy with
what we presented to you,

19:19.503 --> 19:21.136
there may be other directions we can go.

19:21.159 --> 19:23.364
We're done here! Please stop following us!

19:25.142 --> 19:26.311
Don't look back.

19:26.487 --> 19:29.066
Only look forward. Always
in life, look forward.

19:31.976 --> 19:33.735
[Bingo balls rattling]

19:33.966 --> 19:38.327
Jimmy: O-70! O-70! Oh, yeah.

19:38.447 --> 19:40.080
70's a good age.

19:40.200 --> 19:40.985
All right,

19:41.067 --> 19:43.372
duck your heads, 'cause
here comes another number.

19:44.127 --> 19:46.505
N-32.

19:47.268 --> 19:50.009
And the action never stops.

19:50.033 --> 19:51.665
I hope you all took your heart pills,

19:51.696 --> 19:53.789
'cause it's almost too
much excitement, right?

19:54.394 --> 19:56.040
Which one will it be?

19:56.560 --> 19:58.310
Say your prayers. Here it comes.

19:58.708 --> 20:01.361
All right, we've got G-48...

20:01.884 --> 20:04.122
"G," as in "Guy Lombardo."

20:04.181 --> 20:05.932
G-48.

20:06.787 --> 20:10.388
Keep your elbows to yourselves,
okay? No body-checking.

20:10.740 --> 20:12.390
All right, what do we have here?

20:12.392 --> 20:13.823
Wait for it.

20:14.436 --> 20:15.549
B-6.

20:15.789 --> 20:18.147
- [Indistinct conversations]
- Lucky B-6,

20:18.202 --> 20:20.033
just like the vitamin...

20:20.242 --> 20:22.115
all right... which you should be taking.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.953
Keep things moving in the old G.I. tract.

20:25.173 --> 20:26.373
Bingo!

20:26.428 --> 20:28.409
[Bell dings] Oh, we have a winner!

20:29.384 --> 20:31.314
[Applause] Lady luck has struck again.

20:31.487 --> 20:34.219
Let's see a hand so we know who's won.

20:34.339 --> 20:36.748
It's the lovely young lady in the back.

20:36.868 --> 20:39.394
Congratulations, Miss. You've won a, um...

20:39.575 --> 20:41.081
what do we have for the lovely lady?

20:41.431 --> 20:42.056
Notebook.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.835
Yeah, it's an adorable notebook.

20:45.098 --> 20:47.041
Do you like cats, Miss, uh...

20:47.093 --> 20:49.314
Oh, Irene. I love kitties.

20:49.345 --> 20:51.276
I have two siamese cats...

20:51.323 --> 20:53.155
- [Cellphone ringing]
- Oscar and Felix.

20:53.312 --> 20:55.129
Felix can wash himself.

20:55.471 --> 20:58.879
Oscar won't. He he just won't.

20:58.903 --> 21:00.917
What a lovely story. Thank you.

21:00.929 --> 21:03.524
Um, can you take that to Irene?

21:03.564 --> 21:05.723
And when you come back, cover... yeah?

21:05.843 --> 21:07.489
Uh, I'm gonna take a short break,

21:07.501 --> 21:09.978
'cause somebody needs legal help.

[High-pitched British accent]
Offices of James McGill, esquire.

21:19.548 --> 21:21.361
How may I direct your call?

21:23.289 --> 21:27.083
Yes. Yes, of course.
Um, one moment, please.

21:28.793 --> 21:30.521
[Normal voice] Déjà vu. Hello, again.

21:30.537 --> 21:32.484
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

21:32.755 --> 21:34.670
So, how may I be of service?

21:34.827 --> 21:38.641
Well, we would like to hire
you as our attorney, Mr. McGill.

21:39.012 --> 21:40.060
[Chuckles] Wow.

21:41.452 --> 21:43.831
- Really?
- However, we have certain conditions,

21:43.850 --> 21:45.270
and these are not up for debate.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.350
We want no jail time... zero.

21:47.470 --> 21:49.646
Craig is innocent, and we
expect you to prove that.

21:49.717 --> 21:52.269
We won't see his name
smeared like this any longer.

21:52.587 --> 21:54.719
Um, can we back up just a scooch?

21:54.802 --> 21:58.302
'Cause last time we spoke,
you were very enthusiastic...

21:58.565 --> 22:02.545
you were positively insistent
about being represented by HHM.

22:02.702 --> 22:04.532
- Well, uh...
- That's all right. Oh.

22:05.712 --> 22:07.401
We've parted ways.

22:08.851 --> 22:10.391
May I ask why?

22:10.952 --> 22:11.812
We...

22:12.476 --> 22:15.063
disagreed with their defense strategy.

22:15.689 --> 22:17.063
Okay.

22:17.526 --> 22:19.763
They treated us like we were guilty.

22:20.991 --> 22:24.241
So, your previous objections to
my representing you are now...

22:24.302 --> 22:26.453
Oh, I'm sorry about my

22:26.573 --> 22:28.673
è bluntness at our last
encounter. è [Chuckles]

22:28.695 --> 22:30.339
- Unfortunate.
- Mm-hmm.

22:30.398 --> 22:31.529
- Yeah, I...
- But we really...

22:31.649 --> 22:32.811
we're very sorry about that.

22:32.816 --> 22:35.366
We thought long and hard
about it, and, um, we...

22:35.418 --> 22:38.334
And, you know, given your passion

22:38.353 --> 22:40.840
- and your can-do attitude...
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

22:40.870 --> 22:41.681
... we really...

22:41.718 --> 22:44.244
- we just believe that you're the lawyer for us.
- For us, yes.

22:45.927 --> 22:48.249
Well, as flattered as I am by this,

22:48.280 --> 22:49.939
um, since we last spoke,

22:49.951 --> 22:52.181
I've changed my area of specialization,

22:52.691 --> 22:54.811
so I concentrate on elder law now.

22:55.001 --> 22:57.539
But, I mean, you said that
you would fight for us.

22:57.551 --> 22:59.473
- Yeah, you...
- You, you were you were adamant.

22:59.486 --> 23:01.334
You promised to get us
a not-guilty verdict.

23:01.394 --> 23:03.826
I don't think I exactly <i>
promised</i> that.

23:03.845 --> 23:05.600
You said we would be client number one,

23:05.609 --> 23:06.553
morning, noon, or night, and...

23:06.597 --> 23:07.944
Yes, and I meant what I said,

23:08.023 --> 23:09.521
at the time, but

23:09.902 --> 23:11.003
times change.

23:12.435 --> 23:14.833
But we've already paid you a retainer.

23:18.069 --> 23:18.734
Right.

23:19.760 --> 23:20.723
A retainer.

23:21.101 --> 23:22.762
That <i> is</i> what you called it.

23:22.776 --> 23:24.710
That was your specific terminology.

23:25.410 --> 23:25.968
It...

23:26.558 --> 23:28.178
could you excuse me for a moment?

23:28.705 --> 23:31.225
I, uh, had a big gulp on the way over.

23:31.291 --> 23:32.742
- Ohh.
- [Chuckles]

23:32.781 --> 23:34.118
[Man urinating]

23:34.238 --> 23:36.049
[Breathing heavily]

23:36.088 --> 23:37.629

23:38.950 --> 23:40.431

- [Clears throat]

23:41.487 --> 23:42.085
Kim: Hey.

23:42.309 --> 23:43.697
- Hey, there.
- [Urinating stops]

23:45.773 --> 23:46.701
- [Urinating resumes]
- Funny story.

23:46.773 --> 23:49.278
I found something that
belongs to you... again.

23:49.542 --> 23:51.081
- Yeah? What?
- "Who?"

23:51.201 --> 23:54.460
Picture "The 25th Hour,"
starring Ned and Maude Flanders.

23:54.654 --> 23:57.013
Oh, Christ. The Kettlemans?

23:57.196 --> 23:58.845
You lose any <i> other</i> clients today?

23:59.137 --> 23:59.861
[Chuckling] Yeah.

23:59.933 --> 24:01.307
Mr. and Mrs. Cuckoo Bananas

24:01.311 --> 24:03.836
just offered me the plum
job of defending them.

24:04.333 --> 24:05.204
They came to you?

24:05.522 --> 24:06.452
Yeah, I know.

24:06.641 --> 24:08.012
I don't know what you did to piss them off,

24:08.047 --> 24:09.211
but it must have been good.

24:09.721 --> 24:10.724
W... what did they tell you?

24:10.844 --> 24:12.935
Not much, just, uh,

24:13.306 --> 24:16.114
- that you treated them like they were guilty.
- [Chuckles]

24:16.727 --> 24:17.567
Jesus.

24:17.961 --> 24:18.836
Look, Jimmy...

24:20.342 --> 24:20.993
I know...

24:21.236 --> 24:23.444
[Inhales deeply] I know
this is a lot to ask,

24:23.460 --> 24:25.958
but you have to convince
them to come back to HHM.

24:26.005 --> 24:27.610
- I do, huh?
- Yes.

24:27.952 --> 24:29.697
- [Urinal flushes]
- Please. It's important.

24:30.317 --> 24:31.588
What's it worth to you?

24:31.711 --> 24:32.868
Jimmy, I'm serious.

24:32.874 --> 24:34.529
They left because they
think they can win this case,

24:34.551 --> 24:35.560
but they can't.

24:36.035 --> 24:37.570
I managed to scrape together...

24:37.690 --> 24:39.634
from practically nothing, I might add...

24:39.662 --> 24:41.197
a deal they should feel lucky to have.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.971
This is their absolute best bet.

24:45.024 --> 24:45.730
Please...

24:46.540 --> 24:49.299
Make them understand it's better
for them if they come back.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.369
Tell me about this deal.

24:53.734 --> 24:54.690
Elder law?

24:54.775 --> 24:57.377
- I don't know what that is.
- Yeah, me neither.

24:58.644 --> 25:01.229
Elder. Do you think...

25:01.458 --> 25:04.665
- Maybe if we were old...
- Sorry. Whoo! Oh.

25:04.668 --> 25:07.187
- [Chuckles]
- The mysteries of the bladder. Right?

25:07.200 --> 25:09.485
- [Chuckles]
- So, how do we get started?

25:09.517 --> 25:11.821
Do you need us to sign that little paper?

25:12.312 --> 25:13.136
I am...

25:13.191 --> 25:16.454
I am very sorry, but I'm
afraid I can't take your case.

25:16.472 --> 25:19.747
My schedule is just... it's
just chock-full right now.

25:20.337 --> 25:23.089
I highly encourage you to go back to HHM.

25:23.126 --> 25:25.496
I'm certain they would
welcome you with open arms.

25:25.510 --> 25:28.583
No, we're not going
back there. They were...

25:29.215 --> 25:31.409
- incompatible.
- I understand.

25:31.427 --> 25:33.269
They asked you to face
some harsh realities,

25:33.389 --> 25:34.425
and I get it...

25:34.724 --> 25:36.257
no one likes that. But

25:36.784 --> 25:37.953
bottom line here...

25:38.073 --> 25:39.947
Kim Wexler is a fine attorney.

25:39.958 --> 25:42.376
She has a great relationship with the D.A.

25:42.419 --> 25:44.881
Much as I'd love to sing my own praises,

25:45.001 --> 25:46.701
I doubt I could get you a deal

25:46.733 --> 25:48.663
as good as the one she already has.

25:48.699 --> 25:51.478
Okay, we don't want a deal.

25:52.343 --> 25:55.387
We want you, our lawyer,
to exonerate Craig.

25:55.411 --> 25:56.248
"Exonerate"?

25:56.272 --> 25:58.046
That is, uh... that is a big word,

25:58.061 --> 26:00.955
- particularly in your case.
- Yeah, there will be no deal.

26:02.327 --> 26:04.862
There is no money with which
to make a deal. [Chuckles]

26:07.246 --> 26:09.805
We... can we all three just

26:09.925 --> 26:12.785
parachute down from cloud cuckoo land?

26:12.869 --> 26:16.265
'Cause we know, without
question, there <i> is</i> money.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.620
- No, there...
- I distinctly remember a spirited game

26:18.630 --> 26:20.659
of tug-of-war <i>over</i> this money,

26:20.664 --> 26:22.679
money which we then discussed at length.

26:22.845 --> 26:24.433
You made many excuses

26:24.458 --> 26:26.395
justifying your possession of said money.

26:26.404 --> 26:27.358
It's there.

26:27.466 --> 26:29.467
- It exists. S-shh. Now, just... 
-  [Stammers]

26:29.511 --> 26:31.663
please, for my own sanity...

26:31.698 --> 26:34.386
[Clears throat] You can't
hide a big bag of cash forever,

26:34.396 --> 26:37.129
and you certainly will never
be able to spend any of it.

26:37.249 --> 26:41.350
So, go back to HHM,
apologize to Ms. Wexler,

26:41.470 --> 26:44.280
and for Christ's sakes, take the deal.

26:46.826 --> 26:49.670
- If there were any money...
- Lady, enough!

26:50.130 --> 26:52.173
<i>If</i> there were any money,

26:52.444 --> 26:55.434
there would have to be
a full accounting of it.

26:55.472 --> 26:58.283
Every penny would have to be present...

26:59.043 --> 27:02.369
every single penny.

27:02.489 --> 27:04.388
You understand?

27:05.110 --> 27:06.877
All of it.

27:08.397 --> 27:10.556
- That includes the $30,000 that you...
- Craig, yes, he gets it.

27:10.584 --> 27:11.809
Okay. Yeah, he gets it.

27:13.553 --> 27:15.312
We're in this together, Mr. McGill...

27:15.814 --> 27:16.938
Come what may.

27:18.484 --> 27:19.853
Now [Breathes deeply]

27:20.379 --> 27:22.161
where do we begin?

27:26.807 --> 27:29.049
[Telephones ringing]

27:29.101 --> 27:31.101
[Indistinct conversations]

27:45.200 --> 27:47.786
There you go. Kettleman that's all of it.

27:47.792 --> 27:48.617
Where's Kim?

27:49.097 --> 27:50.883
We moved her over to the east wing.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.664
The east wing? That's the cornfield.

27:54.081 --> 27:56.183
Why are you sending her
to the cornfield, Howard?

27:56.232 --> 27:57.639
Never heard it called <i> that</i> before.

27:57.823 --> 27:59.580
[Chuckling] Well, that's what you call it.

28:00.391 --> 28:01.546
You gonna punish her

28:01.564 --> 28:03.687
just 'cause you lost those
two batshit Kettlemans?

28:03.715 --> 28:05.385
You notice I'm not exactly crowing over

28:05.401 --> 28:07.230
- how I snaked them away from you.
- Jimmy,

28:07.589 --> 28:08.542
here are your files.

28:08.609 --> 28:11.209
I'm not gonna discuss my
employee policies with you.

28:12.204 --> 28:14.228
[Sighs] I'm gonna need some help here.

28:15.054 --> 28:15.774
Yeah...

28:16.100 --> 28:17.107
You sure are.

28:22.026 --> 28:23.441
[Grunting]

28:44.999 --> 28:46.626
[Breathing heavily]

28:55.773 --> 28:57.480
That prick firing you?

28:57.822 --> 29:00.165
Best-case scenario is my 2-year plan

29:00.189 --> 29:01.652
just became a 10-year plan.

29:02.509 --> 29:03.438
That schmuck.

29:03.599 --> 29:04.940
You didn't do anything wrong.

29:04.944 --> 29:07.609
- I lost the client.
- Not your fault.

29:07.684 --> 29:10.406
They're not really playing with
a full deck those Kettlemans.

29:11.522 --> 29:13.000
You had to take their case?

29:13.086 --> 29:16.161
I'm sorry, okay? I tried.
I r... I really did.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.460
- I'm not being fair.
- Of course you tried.

29:19.507 --> 29:20.694
They'll do what they want to do.

29:23.133 --> 29:24.438
[Sighs]

29:24.843 --> 29:26.739
Hope you didn't promise them too much.

29:27.089 --> 29:29.739
I doubt you'll be able to do more
for them than we were offering.

29:30.729 --> 29:33.089
You think very highly
of my skills, obviously.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.609
It's not that, Jimmy. It's a loser case.

29:35.849 --> 29:37.930
That deal was their best chance.

29:38.983 --> 29:41.873
After I worked my ass off
finagling with the D.A.,

29:41.877 --> 29:43.780
and it's just like... whatever.

29:43.859 --> 29:45.392
There's got to be a way, you know?

29:45.427 --> 29:47.416
- I take it to court.
- You'll lose.

29:49.142 --> 29:51.564
Kettleman did a terrible
job covering his tracks.

29:51.827 --> 29:53.663
For starters, they've got reams of checks

29:53.679 --> 29:55.484
he wrote for false expenses.

29:55.771 --> 29:57.803
And I can't even challenge
their admission into evidence

29:57.815 --> 29:59.762
because he wrote them to himself.

30:01.787 --> 30:03.887
I know we're never supposed to
say our clients are guilty, but,

30:04.007 --> 30:05.459
hey, not my client anymore...

30:05.474 --> 30:06.756
he's guilty as sin.

30:06.996 --> 30:08.616
Yeah, but there has to be something...

30:08.655 --> 30:11.136
- some loophole or...
- None that I could find.

30:12.037 --> 30:13.449
There has to be a way.

30:13.669 --> 30:14.778
Not without the money.

30:15.926 --> 30:17.322
It's the only chip those Kettlemans have,

30:17.345 --> 30:18.946
and they refuse to play it.

30:42.678 --> 30:43.779

38:44.025 --> 38:45.215
Good morning.

38:45.442 --> 38:47.112
- Betsy: Who is it, Craig?
- Oh, it's Mr. McGill!

38:47.168 --> 38:49.454
Good morning. Come on in. [Chuckles]

38:50.812 --> 38:52.126
[Door closes]

38:55.800 --> 38:58.264
Oh, I love what you've done with the place.

38:58.682 --> 39:00.912
Last time I was here, it was, uh,

39:01.391 --> 39:03.812
well, not a contender for the cover
of <i> good housekeeping... </i>

39:03.849 --> 39:05.509
- that's for sure.
- [Chuckles]

39:05.748 --> 39:07.665
Do you have news about our case?

39:07.785 --> 39:09.870
I do, in fact.

39:10.196 --> 39:12.311
But before we get to the nitty-gritty,

39:12.346 --> 39:14.690
- I think we should chat about your deal.
- Ah.

39:14.810 --> 39:17.054
We told you... there will be no deal.

39:17.324 --> 39:19.143
You did, didn't you?

39:20.052 --> 39:22.317
However, circumstances have changed.

39:22.720 --> 39:24.150
What circumstances?

39:24.270 --> 39:25.807
To answer that, um,

39:26.377 --> 39:28.811
might I suggest that you
go check on that money

39:28.846 --> 39:30.031
you insist you didn't take?

39:30.094 --> 39:32.139
[Chuckles, scoffs]

39:32.207 --> 39:34.778
In the upstairs bathroom, under the sink?

39:35.884 --> 39:38.784
Wait. How could you...

39:39.757 --> 39:42.200
[Rapid footsteps depart]

39:42.449 --> 39:43.742
Betsy!

39:50.952 --> 39:53.525
[Clattering]

39:55.755 --> 39:57.584
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No!

39:57.643 --> 39:59.599
It's okay. It's okay,
Betsy. It's got to be...

39:59.648 --> 40:01.609
No. It's got to be in there somewhere.

40:01.776 --> 40:03.600
[Thudding]

40:06.601 --> 40:08.291
What did you do with it?

40:08.411 --> 40:12.213
- By "it," you mean...
- Where is it?!

40:12.242 --> 40:14.757
Oh. You mean the money.

40:14.959 --> 40:18.008
Uh, let me see. Uh, it's, uh,

40:18.128 --> 40:21.389
- on its way to the D.A.'s desk right about now.
- What?

40:21.404 --> 40:24.629
You... oh, you thief!

40:24.652 --> 40:26.511
- Takes one to know one, doesn't it?
- He took it?

40:26.543 --> 40:28.004
How did you take it?

40:28.188 --> 40:30.610
A good magician never reveals his secrets.

40:30.616 --> 40:31.771
Now, here's what we're gonna do.

40:31.808 --> 40:33.503
Oh, you don't tell us what to do.

40:33.540 --> 40:35.230
You stole from us. We'll...

40:35.672 --> 40:37.558
we will have you arrested.

40:39.340 --> 40:42.442
I... I can see how upset you are, and,

40:42.786 --> 40:46.172
even on a good day, you
and logic are... [whistles]

40:46.381 --> 40:48.107
But think about what you just said.

40:48.285 --> 40:50.398
Criminals have no recourse. And you two...

40:50.434 --> 40:52.101
you're criminals, big-time.

40:52.324 --> 40:54.306
- How dare you?
- Luckily,

40:54.475 --> 40:56.371
you have a very talented lawyer

40:56.457 --> 40:58.396
who has found a way to minimize the damage

40:58.416 --> 40:59.497
you've brought upon yourselves.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.860
- [Scoffs] Oh. Oh, you're fired.
- Oh,

41:01.883 --> 41:03.354
I quit already.

41:03.413 --> 41:05.245
No, I'm talking about Kim Wexler.

41:05.588 --> 41:06.740
Now, you're gonna go back to her,

41:06.779 --> 41:07.581
you're gonna apologize

41:07.613 --> 41:09.917
for your hasty decision
to terminate her services,

41:09.944 --> 41:12.602
and you're gonna fall on
her mercy and take that deal.

41:13.042 --> 41:14.164
We'll tell...

41:14.781 --> 41:16.877
- about the bribe you took.
- You could do that.

41:18.269 --> 41:19.590
You absolutely could.

41:19.621 --> 41:22.047
And I'd be in a mess of
trouble... a real pickle...

41:23.737 --> 41:26.230
But so would you, Mrs. Kettleman.

41:26.510 --> 41:29.018
'Cause right now, only Mr.
Kettleman is on the hook

41:29.054 --> 41:31.424
for the whole embezzlement kerfuffle.

41:31.544 --> 41:34.452
But the bribe... w... we're
back to calling it a bribe?...

41:34.572 --> 41:36.724
Yeah, that implicates you, as well.

41:36.802 --> 41:37.825
It does not.

41:38.038 --> 41:40.200
- It was all me.
- No, it wasn't.

41:40.432 --> 41:42.279
I'll make sure everyone knows that.

41:42.903 --> 41:44.155
[Sighs]

41:44.529 --> 41:46.090
Look on the bright side, you know?

41:46.133 --> 41:47.018
They could

41:47.207 --> 41:50.938
work out some kind of
inter-prison visitation program,

41:51.058 --> 41:52.539
the occasional conjugal.

41:52.566 --> 41:54.076
Maybe it won't be all bad.

41:54.276 --> 41:57.205
You... you'll probably wind
up running your own gang.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.399
Thing you folks need to know about me...

42:01.669 --> 42:03.391
I got nothing to lose.

42:04.424 --> 42:06.295
Christ, you should see my office.

42:10.727 --> 42:12.622
- No, it's not over.
- Yeah.

42:13.491 --> 42:14.733
Let's find another lawyer.

42:14.769 --> 42:16.562
- Come on, Betsy.
- No, no.

42:16.682 --> 42:17.654
- [Sighs]
- No.

42:17.938 --> 42:19.404
We don't have to put up with this.

42:19.955 --> 42:22.640
- I will <i> not</i> be treated this way.
- Betsy...

42:23.863 --> 42:24.995
The kids.

42:25.876 --> 42:26.765
The...

42:29.993 --> 42:31.522
We have to do this...

42:31.932 --> 42:33.060
For the kids.

42:33.253 --> 42:34.118
[Sighs]

42:34.192 --> 42:35.793
They can't lose us both.

42:36.504 --> 42:37.844
[Crying]

42:40.409 --> 42:41.179
We have to.

42:41.230 --> 42:42.673
[Sobbing] No.

42:43.129 --> 42:43.955
Shh.

42:44.002 --> 42:46.432
No. [Sobbing]

42:46.448 --> 42:47.678
It's okay.

42:48.368 --> 42:49.290
[Sniffles]

42:49.330 --> 42:51.585
- [Sobbing]
- It's okay.

42:51.760 --> 42:53.518
Shh.

43:06.564 --> 43:08.943
