14:18.188 --> 14:20.188
JAMIE: So, what
do you think, man?

14:20.223 --> 14:21.750
KEVIN: Why? Are you
actually thinking about it?

14:21.785 --> 14:24.126
JAMIE: No, man,
I'm fuckin' doing it.

14:24.161 --> 14:25.360
KEVIN: Right.

14:25.396 --> 14:27.327
Like Krista's going to leave
the valley and move out there.

14:28.330 --> 14:30.297
Hey Krista!
Krista!

14:30.332 --> 14:31.661
KRISTA: Jamie,
we've gotta get to town.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.597
JAMIE: A wife has to go where
her husband goes, right?

14:33.632 --> 14:35.137
KRISTA: Oh, is he going
to town with me?

14:35.172 --> 14:36.501
I said,
a wife has to go

14:36.536 --> 14:38.107
where her husband
goes, right?

14:38.142 --> 14:39.636
KRISTA: Okay, yes.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.309
Now get your butt
in that truck to town, Jamie.

14:42.344 --> 14:43.772
KEVIN: Hey, Chick!
Where you going?

14:43.807 --> 14:45.312
CHICKY: Home
to feed Clarence.

14:45.347 --> 14:47.149
JAMIE: Ah, make
the old fucker wait.

14:47.184 --> 14:48.612
KEVIN: I'm gonna
walk with you.

14:48.647 --> 14:49.413
JAMIE: Hey,
come on, man.

14:49.448 --> 14:51.153
Hey dude, I'm not
ready to go yet.

14:51.188 --> 14:52.187
Kev!

14:54.059 --> 14:55.454
Kev wants
a blow job.

14:55.489 --> 14:56.155
KEVIN: Shut the fuck up!

14:56.190 --> 14:57.621
JAMIE: I heard him.
He does.

14:57.656 --> 14:59.623
CHICKY: Jesus, Jame!

14:59.658 --> 15:00.789
JAMIE: Hey sis!
Sis!

15:00.824 --> 15:02.362
Save me some dinner,
all right?

15:02.397 --> 15:03.229
CHICKY: Yeah?
Why should I?

15:03.265 --> 15:04.364
JAMIE: 'Cause
I'm your little brother,

15:04.399 --> 15:05.629
you gotta
take care of me.

15:05.664 --> 15:08.368
CHICKY: Starting Saturday,
I don't, do I?

15:10.669 --> 15:12.636
KRISTA: Jamie,
you coming?

15:12.671 --> 15:14.539
We got stuff to do
in town today.

15:16.510 --> 15:17.509
C'mon.

15:18.809 --> 15:20.017
Let's go.

15:26.421 --> 15:28.124
KRISTA: You need to pick up
your shoes today, Jamie.

15:28.159 --> 15:29.325
JAMIE: Jesus.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.622
KRISTA: And I need you to
pick up the washing machine too.

15:31.657 --> 15:33.063
JAMIE: Why don't you just
wash at your mother's?

15:33.098 --> 15:34.361
KRISTA: I'm not doing that.
I told you.

15:34.396 --> 15:36.297
I'm not
doing that I told you.

15:36.332 --> 15:37.498
KRISTA: Geez,
you're pissy today.

15:37.533 --> 15:39.498
JAMIE: Yeah, well I hear it
every fuckin' day, you know.

15:39.533 --> 15:41.797
KRISTA: Jamie, Danny'll
be out by noon,

15:41.832 --> 15:44.470
you can pick it up after lunch
and take it to the trailer.

15:44.505 --> 15:46.472
It'll take like
two seconds, Jamie.

15:46.507 --> 15:47.473
JAMIE: Yup.

15:47.508 --> 15:48.639
KRISTA: 'Cause he said
he'd be out by today.

15:48.674 --> 15:50.377
That's what
he said, Jamie.

15:50.808 --> 15:52.181
Yeah, okay,
I'm calling him right now.

15:52.216 --> 15:53.710
He's got to be out
by tomorrow.

15:53.745 --> 15:54.744
But Jamie,
we need that trailer.

15:54.780 --> 15:55.412
JAMIE: I told Danny
he could have the trailer

15:55.447 --> 15:57.318
'til October,
all right?

15:57.353 --> 15:58.152
KRISTA: Yeah, right.

15:58.187 --> 15:59.220
JAMIE: Babe,
that's $2500 in cash.

15:59.255 --> 16:02.224
KRISTA: No, Jamie!
Where are we supposed to live?

16:02.259 --> 16:03.687
Jamie! I'm not living
with Clarence.

16:03.722 --> 16:04.755
JAMIE: Well we need
the money, all right?

16:04.790 --> 16:05.789
KRISTA: But Jamie, this is
the most important...

16:05.824 --> 16:06.990
JAMIE: I don't wanna fuckin'
live there either.

16:07.026 --> 16:08.461
KRISTA: Yes but Jamie, this
is the most important thing.

16:08.496 --> 16:09.759
JAMIE: Hey, hey.

16:09.794 --> 16:10.760
KRISTA: What?

16:10.795 --> 16:11.694
JAMIE: We rent to Danny
for a couple of months,

16:11.730 --> 16:13.466
we got enough
to fuckin' get somewhere.

16:13.501 --> 16:14.467
KRISTA: Jamie, I don't
want a honeymoon.

16:14.502 --> 16:16.766
JAMIE: I told
Danny he has it.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.768
Like fuck...

16:18.803 --> 16:21.012
you love me
or you don't.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.147
KRISTA: I'm marrying you,
aren't I?

16:24.182 --> 16:26.479
JAMIE: Shut up.
KRISTA: Mmhmm.

16:26.514 --> 16:28.646
KRISTA: I thought that's
what we were doing, Jamie.

16:28.681 --> 16:29.779
No. Stop it!
Not here.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.187
JAMIE: Why not?

16:31.222 --> 16:33.222
KRISTA: Well,
I was thinking...

16:33.257 --> 16:35.521
maybe we shouldn't make love
until the wedding night.

16:36.657 --> 16:37.823
KRISTA: Yes, Jamie, it would
make it more special.

16:37.859 --> 16:41.329
JAMIE: Babe, just waiting
is not gonna make you a virgin.

16:41.661 --> 16:42.327
KRISTA: Jamie!

16:42.362 --> 16:43.760
JAMIE: Hey,
you make me wait

16:43.795 --> 16:45.630
the minute you say I do,
I'll be on you!

16:45.665 --> 16:46.598
The minister
will be like,

16:46.633 --> 16:48.303
Hey, I said kiss the bride,
not fuck her.

16:48.338 --> 16:49.667
KRISTA: I hate it
when you call it that.

16:49.702 --> 16:51.636
JAMIE: Sorry.
I said to kiss the bride,

16:51.671 --> 16:53.374
not to make love
to her.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.475
KRISTA: Okay.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.246
Soon as
we're married,

16:57.281 --> 16:58.544
I'm divorcing you,
Jamie.

16:58.579 --> 16:59.776
JAMIE: Yeah, right.
Bullshit you are!

16:59.811 --> 17:00.677
KRISTA: That's what
I'm doing!

17:00.712 --> 17:03.021
JAMIE: You fuckin'
try that shit on me.

17:14.331 --> 17:15.561
JAMIE: Come here.

17:15.596 --> 17:16.727
KRISTA: No!
What are you doing?!

17:16.762 --> 17:18.630
No! Watch
the road, Jamie!

17:21.338 --> 17:22.667
KRISTA: Heyyyy!

17:28.345 --> 17:30.213
KRISTA: No, Jamie,
we gotta get to town.

17:31.348 --> 17:32.611
JAMIE: Babe, just
one second, all right?

17:32.646 --> 17:33.612
KRISTA: No, Jamie!

17:33.647 --> 17:36.087
JAMIE: Babe, one -
one second.

17:36.122 --> 17:37.451
KRISTA: You...

17:46.330 --> 17:47.329
JAMIE: Hey.

17:48.332 --> 17:50.332
Hey, buddy.
Come on.

17:52.435 --> 17:56.239
Sky, eat.
Come on.

17:56.274 --> 17:57.768
Come on, bud.

17:59.343 --> 18:00.540
Buddy, you gotta eat,
come on.

18:01.510 --> 18:02.042
JAMIE: Sky.

18:02.775 --> 18:03.307
JAMIE: Sky.

18:04.010 --> 18:04.475
JAMIE: You gotta
eat, bud.

18:16.690 --> 18:17.755
CHICKY: Hey!

18:17.790 --> 18:19.295
Coulda
used a ride.

18:19.330 --> 18:20.329
KRISTA: Sorry.

18:24.797 --> 18:27.094
CLARENCE: Betty, look,

18:27.129 --> 18:31.637
I called to tell you
to hang on to everything.

18:31.672 --> 18:33.067
Don't give
anything away,

18:33.102 --> 18:35.069
not a single thing
that he touched, eh,

18:35.104 --> 18:36.137
not even a toy.

18:36.172 --> 18:38.215
You think you don't want
reminders now, but you do.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.349
You will, Betty.
Betty?

18:40.384 --> 18:42.153
CHICKY: What the hell are
you calling Betty for?

18:42.188 --> 18:44.551
CLARENCE: I was
just trying to help.

18:44.586 --> 18:46.685
So she don't do what I do
and hold onto things.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.292
ChICKY: Jesus,
she's too upset to hear you.

18:49.327 --> 18:49.959
CLARENCE: Wonder
if there's gonna be

18:49.995 --> 18:52.020
some dinner
around here?

18:53.496 --> 18:55.364
CHICKY: What
the hell's this?

18:56.235 --> 18:57.234
CLARENCE: Trav.

19:01.339 --> 19:03.031
That's an artist
rendition.

19:04.342 --> 19:08.135
That's what he'd
look like today. See?

19:08.170 --> 19:10.038
He looks pretty good,
don't he?

19:11.349 --> 19:13.217
CHICKY: How much
did this cost?

19:14.814 --> 19:17.386
We still owe on
the headstone, you know.

19:17.421 --> 19:18.816
CHICKY: Jesus
fuckin' Christ.

19:18.851 --> 19:19.617
JAMIE: Hey.

19:19.652 --> 19:20.551
CHICKY: Shouldn't
you be working?

19:20.586 --> 19:23.458
JAMIE: Ah fuck, I -
I might be laid off.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.229
CHICKY: I haven't heard
Earl's laying off men.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.096
JAMIE: I don't work
chainsaw.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.298
CHICKY: So what,
you're fuckin' quitting?

19:27.333 --> 19:30.465
CLARENCE: Remember how fast
Trav learned to ride a bike?

19:30.500 --> 19:31.433
JAMIE: Jesus.

19:31.468 --> 19:33.127
Who the fuck are you
talking to anyway, man?

19:33.162 --> 19:34.028
CHICKY: Jamie,
don't start on him.

19:34.063 --> 19:34.895
CLARENCE: Oprah had
this man on there

19:34.931 --> 19:37.098
saying mothers
don't talk to their kids

19:37.133 --> 19:38.132
more than
five minutes a day.

19:38.168 --> 19:41.135
They don't know their kids
from their assholes.

19:41.170 --> 19:42.774
JAMIE: Yeah, five minutes,
that's what, like

19:42.809 --> 19:44.644
four and a half minutes longer
than we ever talked, right?

19:44.679 --> 19:46.382
CHICKY: Don't start
on him.

19:47.814 --> 19:49.286
JAMIE: Okay, Chicky,
time us.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.320
CHICKY: Jamie!

19:53.688 --> 19:55.226
JAMIE: C'mon,
say something.

19:56.427 --> 19:57.756
To me, man.

20:01.795 --> 20:02.992
No?

20:04.336 --> 20:06.336
Yeah. Right.

20:20.682 --> 20:22.616
KRISTA: Gotta pay
the balance on the hall.

20:22.651 --> 20:24.651
And I'm gonna need some extra
money for the catering too.

20:24.686 --> 20:26.785
Did you get
the extra shifts?

20:26.820 --> 20:28.358
Jamie?

20:29.658 --> 20:31.658
Have you seen my sunglasses?
I just had them.

20:34.498 --> 20:36.025
Jamie, again?

20:41.802 --> 20:44.770
Oh, you picked up your shoes
like I said, right, Jamie?

20:44.805 --> 20:47.311
You picked them up
today, did you?

20:47.346 --> 20:48.012
Did you?

20:48.047 --> 20:49.511
What are you doing,
Jamie?

20:50.349 --> 20:52.041
Jamie,
what are you doing?

20:54.353 --> 20:55.682
JAMIE: I, uh...

20:56.817 --> 20:58.355
KRISTA: Mmhmm?

20:59.358 --> 21:02.293
JAMIE: I'll get the washer
tomorrow, all right?

21:02.328 --> 21:03.756
KRISTA: Okay.
JAMIE: Okay.

21:03.791 --> 21:05.494
KRISTA: Hey,
you better.

21:08.796 --> 21:10.158
Love ya.

21:25.681 --> 21:27.208
JAMIE: Hey!

21:28.816 --> 21:30.519
You and me, right?

22:17.799 --> 22:19.128
EARL: Hey, Jamie.

22:19.163 --> 22:19.766
JAMIE: Hey.

22:19.801 --> 22:21.064
EARL: What's going on?

22:21.803 --> 22:23.264
Everything okay?

22:24.773 --> 22:26.674
JAMIE: This is
my week's notice.

22:26.709 --> 22:27.708
EARL: Oh.

22:27.743 --> 22:28.642
JAMIE: Yeah, yeah.

22:28.678 --> 22:31.107
EARL: Well I guess

22:31.142 --> 22:32.779
JAMIE: Yeah, I'll finish out

22:32.814 --> 22:35.276
EARL: Okay. Sure.

22:35.311 --> 22:36.486
See ya.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.493
JAMIE: Okay. All right.

24:16.819 --> 24:18.346
Jamie!

24:19.184 --> 24:20.491
Jamie!

24:31.163 --> 24:32.503
KEVIN: Jamie!

24:35.332 --> 24:37.332
JAMIE: Kev!
Shit!

24:38.808 --> 24:40.643
Shit.
C'mon buddy.

24:43.340 --> 24:46.517
JAMIE: Chick,

24:46.552 --> 24:49.817
Oh shit! Shit!
Come on! Come on, buddy.

24:49.852 --> 24:51.555
I got you, eh?
Come on.

24:53.823 --> 24:55.526
All right, sit up.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.627
KEVIN: I'll fuckin'
kill you.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.124
JAMIE: C'mon! Man!
Kev, it's me! It's Jamie.

25:00.159 --> 25:03.457
It's Jamie, okay?
Come on. Stop.

25:03.492 --> 25:04.258
KEVIN: Jamie.

25:04.293 --> 25:05.294
JAMIE: Wait,
what are you doing?

25:05.329 --> 25:06.295
CHICKY: I'm cleaning up!

25:06.330 --> 25:08.000
JAMIE: No, that's
his fuckin' job. Come on.

25:09.168 --> 25:12.169
CHICKY: Hey! Kevin,
what happened?

25:12.809 --> 25:15.205
JAMIE: Merv, right?

25:15.240 --> 25:16.646
Fuck man, I warned you,
didn't I?

25:16.681 --> 25:18.076
You're a fuckin' idiot!
I fuckin' told you!

25:18.111 --> 25:19.649
CHICKY: Hey, Fuzzy!
Jesus Christ!

25:19.684 --> 25:21.310
JAMIE: I got it,
all right?

25:21.345 --> 25:22.311
CHICKY: Aren't you taking him
to emergency?

25:22.346 --> 25:24.082
JAMIE: Go to bed.
Go to bed.

25:24.117 --> 25:25.622
KEVIN: Chicky,
I'm sorry.

25:27.692 --> 25:28.625
CHICKY: It's okay, Kev.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.517
KEVIN: I didn't
mean to...

25:30.552 --> 25:31.793
CHICKY: It's okay.

25:31.828 --> 25:33.531
KEVIN: You're really
nice to me.

25:35.227 --> 25:36.567
I like you.

25:38.802 --> 25:40.329
Oh God,
I hate myself.

25:42.564 --> 25:44.773
Ohhh God,
I hate myself.

25:44.808 --> 25:46.302
JAMIE: Okay,
go to bed, c'mon.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.172
CHICKY: Okay.
Just go easy on him.

25:48.207 --> 25:50.141
I hate myself.

25:50.176 --> 25:51.780
I hate myself.

25:51.815 --> 25:52.781
JAMIE: Okay,
Kevin.

25:52.816 --> 25:56.279
I hate myself. I hate myself.

25:56.314 --> 25:58.479
JAMIE: Okay, okay, okay.
Shhh!

25:58.514 --> 26:00.217
Kev, shut up.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.387
Here, look at me.
Look at me.

26:05.422 --> 26:07.125
Look at me.
Come on.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.768
Fuck, man. I told you,
I fuckin' told you!

26:12.803 --> 26:15.496
KEVIN: They said
if I didn't go I'd be a fag.

26:18.171 --> 26:20.039
They made me
look at his...

26:21.537 --> 26:23.614
they said if I didn't
they would cut my balls off.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.341
JAMIE: Okay, shut up, man,
just shut up!

26:27.180 --> 26:29.785
KEVIN: They made me...
they made me ...

26:29.820 --> 26:32.788
JAMIE: I don't
wanna hear it, okay?

26:32.823 --> 26:33.514
Okay?

26:33.549 --> 26:34.724
KEVIN: Mmhmm.

26:36.486 --> 26:38.992
JAMIE: You gotta keep
that shit to yourself, okay?

26:40.457 --> 26:45.229
You can't tell... you
can't tell anybody, okay?

26:45.264 --> 26:47.330
You can't.

26:47.365 --> 26:50.102
KEVIN: Make those
fuckin' faggots pay.

26:50.137 --> 26:51.301
Make 'em pay.

26:51.336 --> 26:53.336
JAMIE: It was your
own fuckin' fault, man!

26:57.815 --> 26:59.342
JAMIE: Shit.

27:03.348 --> 27:04.787
JAMIE: C'mon.

27:04.822 --> 27:06.151
I'm sorry, Jamie.

27:06.186 --> 27:09.154
JAMIE: That's okay,
buddy. C'mon.

27:09.189 --> 27:10.088
I'm sorry, Jame.

27:10.124 --> 27:12.289
JAMIE: Shhh, no, don't,
don't man, c'mon.

27:15.327 --> 27:17.195
JAMIE: Hey Kev,
don't cry. Hey.

27:18.165 --> 27:20.627
Don't -- hey don't --
don't cry, okay.

27:20.662 --> 27:22.200
Shhhh.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.503
JAMIE: Fuck me!
FUCK!

27:38.350 --> 27:40.614
KEVIN: Jame...

27:40.649 --> 27:44.288
they was talking about
your stag.

27:44.323 --> 27:45.795
They're saying they're
gonna get you drunked up

27:45.830 --> 27:48.358
and dress you up
in women's clothes.

27:49.801 --> 27:50.934
And then
when you pass out,

27:50.969 --> 27:53.033
they're gonna leave you in
the Tim Horton's parking lot

27:53.068 --> 27:54.562
dressed like that.

27:56.236 --> 27:57.565
JAMIE: Oh.

28:00.339 --> 28:02.207
Good thing
you told me, buddy.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.716
KEVIN: Good on me,
eh, Jamie?

28:05.751 --> 28:07.817
JAMIE: Yeah. Yeah.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.720
Yeah, good
on you, Kev.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.053
CHICKY: Jesus,
Reggie.

29:20.617 --> 29:22.287
On your own
today?

29:22.322 --> 29:23.455
REG: Carol's milking.

29:25.490 --> 29:28.359
Hey, look what I found in
the truck from the other day.

29:31.793 --> 29:34.497
You know, you're lucky
she didn't find that first.

29:40.736 --> 29:44.276
So, do you think it's swimming
season yet, or what?

29:47.677 --> 29:49.644
Tomorrow
morning, 10 o'clock,

29:49.679 --> 29:51.217
I'll be there.

30:06.795 --> 30:08.135
KRISTA: Mom,
what do you think?

30:08.170 --> 30:09.303
Up or down
for the wedding?

30:11.800 --> 30:14.636
I like up, because I think
it's more formal or something...

30:14.671 --> 30:16.671
KRISTA'S MOM: Krista, please,
I'm watching my show.

30:18.345 --> 30:21.346
KRISTA: Mom, I gotta
get my hair right.

30:23.548 --> 30:25.317
I like up, but
Chicky says that...

30:25.352 --> 30:26.780
KRISTA'S MOM: Krista,
what do you think

30:26.815 --> 30:29.684
is gonna happen to you
in five years, huh?

30:30.489 --> 30:32.489
Do you see
your father around?

30:51.147 --> 30:52.179
JAMIE: Ooof!

30:52.214 --> 30:54.709
Hi.

31:04.787 --> 31:08.756
KRISTA: If you were an animal,
what would you be?

31:08.791 --> 31:11.000
KRISTA: What?

31:17.767 --> 31:20.306
JAMIE: You'd be a deer.

31:20.341 --> 31:22.341
KRISTA: Yeah?
JAMIE: Yeah.

31:23.344 --> 31:25.047
KRISTA: What'd you be?

31:28.184 --> 31:29.513
JAMIE: A wolf.

31:30.813 --> 31:33.517
KRISTA: Yeah.
A puppy.

31:34.817 --> 31:37.026
KRISTA: Oh my god,
Jamie!

32:08.257 --> 32:10.752
JAMIE: Hey. You understand
any of this?

32:12.657 --> 32:15.097
KRISTA: No.

32:15.132 --> 32:17.264
JAMIE: I have
no clue

32:17.299 --> 32:19.629
what they want
you to do with this.

32:19.664 --> 32:21.631
KRISTA: Jesus,
I hate poetry.

32:21.666 --> 32:23.765
JAMIE: Hey!
Don't you swear.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.437
Fuckin'
potty mouth.

32:25.472 --> 32:27.373
KRISTA: I told Dagly I don't
have time to write an essay.

32:27.408 --> 32:29.177
He said,
I know, Krista,

32:29.212 --> 32:31.476
your colour scheme
is the talk of the town.

32:31.511 --> 32:32.708
That's what he said!

32:32.743 --> 32:34.149
JAMIE: Your butt's
the talk of the town,

32:34.184 --> 32:35.150
that's what it is.

32:35.185 --> 32:38.747
KRISTA: No! Jamie!
I have to read this poem.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.122
JAMIE: I thought
you hated poetry.

32:40.157 --> 32:40.856
KRISTA: Yeah,
but I have to read it

32:40.891 --> 32:41.557
or I'm going to
fail English.

32:41.592 --> 32:42.157
JAMIE: You're
not failing.

32:42.193 --> 32:43.192
KRISTA: Yeah,
I know.

32:43.227 --> 32:45.193
JAMIE: Hey, Krista,
you're not failing, okay?

32:45.228 --> 32:46.293
KRISTA: Yeah,
I know, Jamie.

32:46.328 --> 32:48.757
JAMIE: You wanna
end up like me, or what?

32:48.792 --> 32:50.495
Jamie.

32:53.665 --> 32:55.368
JAMIE: Hey,
read me the poem.

32:56.338 --> 32:57.403
What?

32:57.438 --> 32:59.174
JAMIE: I'm serious,
come on.

32:59.209 --> 33:01.242
C'mon,
read it to me.

33:01.277 --> 33:04.476
It's supposed to be
romantic, isn't it?

33:04.511 --> 33:07.050
KRISTA: I'm no good.

33:07.085 --> 33:09.481
JAMIE: I don't
give a shit.

33:11.353 --> 33:12.517
Come here.

33:14.851 --> 33:15.784
"I am a bird cage ..."

33:15.819 --> 33:18.127
KRISTA: Okay, yeah.
Yeah, okay. I can read.

33:18.162 --> 33:19.095
JAMIE: "... a bone cage..."

33:19.130 --> 33:21.394
KRISTA: I can read!

33:21.429 --> 33:23.429
"I am a bird cage.

33:23.464 --> 33:26.201
A bone cage
with a bird.

33:26.236 --> 33:27.565
The bird
in my bone cage,

33:27.600 --> 33:30.469
is death
that makes its nest.

33:30.504 --> 33:33.142
It's a bird
held captive.

33:33.177 --> 33:35.243
Would it not like
to fly away.

33:35.278 --> 33:37.707
Is it you
who holds it back?

33:37.742 --> 33:39.214
Is it me?

33:39.249 --> 33:41.183
What is it?

33:41.218 --> 33:44.219
It cannot leave until
it has eaten everything.

33:44.254 --> 33:46.749
It will have my soul
in its beak."

33:48.687 --> 33:51.127
KRISTA: I have no idea
what it means.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.623
JAMIE: No.

33:52.658 --> 33:54.130
KRISTA: Hey.
JAMIE: Mmm.

33:54.165 --> 33:55.758
KRISTA: You okay?

33:55.793 --> 33:57.166
JAMIE: No.

33:58.334 --> 34:01.467
KRISTA: Hey, hey, Jamie.

34:01.502 --> 34:03.700
You and me.

34:03.735 --> 34:05.273
JAMIE: Yeah.

34:41.102 --> 34:44.070
JAMIE: Hey, that's for
the turkey dinner

34:44.105 --> 34:45.445
and whatever.

34:46.514 --> 34:48.041
KRISTA: Where you going?

34:48.076 --> 34:49.581
JAMIE: Town, woman!

34:50.485 --> 34:52.287
JAMIE: Hey Dad.

34:52.322 --> 34:53.651
Dad!

35:07.700 --> 35:11.306
JAMIE: Hey, did you
get your disability, yet?

35:11.341 --> 35:12.670
CLARENCE: Yeah.

35:13.178 --> 35:14.441
JAMIE: All right,
well just don't blow it

35:14.476 --> 35:15.575
on smokes, all right?

35:15.611 --> 35:18.511
And you should pay some stuff
this month with the...

35:18.546 --> 35:20.249
with the wedding.

35:22.814 --> 35:26.453
CLARENCE: Betty's
burying her boy, eh?

35:26.488 --> 35:29.786
JAMIE: Yeah.
Yeah, I heard.

35:29.821 --> 35:32.294
CLARENCE: I tried to tell her
to keep all his toys

35:32.329 --> 35:34.197
and everything.
I told her.

35:37.334 --> 35:39.334
It's too empty,
isn't it?

35:43.802 --> 35:45.505
JAMIE: All right, man,

35:45.540 --> 35:47.705
just don't blow it
on smokes, all right?

35:48.807 --> 35:51.181
JAMIE: Hey Kev, come on,
you're coming with me, man.

35:54.175 --> 35:55.680
JAMIE: Yeah, up.

36:00.819 --> 36:02.423
KEVIN: It's stuck.
Wait, it's stuck.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.161
JAMIE: There you go.

36:13.161 --> 36:14.633
JAMIE: Hey, light me.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.109
JAMIE: What?

36:29.144 --> 36:32.079
You look fuckin'
awesome, man.

36:32.114 --> 36:33.652
Aw, girls'll
love it, man.

36:33.687 --> 36:36.050
You'll finally
get a chick now.

36:39.792 --> 36:41.297
JAMIE: Fuckin' Merv!

36:41.332 --> 36:43.299
Fuckin' cocksucker!

36:45.732 --> 36:47.270
JAMIE: Oh fuck!

36:49.802 --> 36:50.768
JAMIE: What the fuck!

36:58.811 --> 37:00.349
KEVIN: There,
you're good.

37:08.821 --> 37:11.118
JAMIE: Ah, shit.

37:12.154 --> 37:15.760
JAMIE: Fuck! C'mon man,
it's not fuckin' funny.

37:15.795 --> 37:18.158
Jesus Christ.

37:18.193 --> 37:20.061
Alright c'mon,
you go down there. C'mon.

37:21.669 --> 37:24.472
All right,
here we go. Up.

37:24.507 --> 37:25.440
KEVIN: I can't.

37:25.475 --> 37:26.738
JAMIE: Grab it.
Ah Jesus!

37:33.813 --> 37:35.648
JAMIE: There.

37:35.683 --> 37:37.210
I'll be in
in a minute.

37:47.794 --> 37:50.124
JAMIE: Come on, bud.

37:50.159 --> 37:52.467
Come on.

37:52.502 --> 37:57.307
It's okay.
It's okay, buddy.

37:57.342 --> 38:00.772
Hey Sky, come here.
Come eat, come eat.

38:00.807 --> 38:02.510
Sky, come on, bud.

38:04.811 --> 38:06.349
Sky!

38:28.263 --> 38:31.231
KRISTA: Oh my God, Jamie,
what are you wearing?

38:31.266 --> 38:32.672
You're not really
going out like that, right?

38:32.707 --> 38:34.476
JAMIE: A little surprise
for Merv, right Kev?

38:34.511 --> 38:35.642
KRISTA: Jamie,
what is this? No!!!

38:37.173 --> 38:38.348
JAMIE: Come here.

38:40.814 --> 38:42.649
KRISTA: Kev, what did
you do to your face?

38:42.684 --> 38:44.145
KEVIN: It's pretty
fuckin' cool, right?

38:44.180 --> 38:45.146
KRISTA: Well isn't
he gonna look great

38:45.181 --> 38:46.080
in our wedding photos,
Jamie.

38:46.116 --> 38:48.314
JAMIE: I think
it's pretty fuckin' cool.

38:48.349 --> 38:50.525
KRISTA: Did you get
the washing machine?

38:50.560 --> 38:53.154
JAMIE: Yeah, I got it.
But I'm gonna warn ya,

38:53.189 --> 38:55.288
it's a piece
of shit.

38:55.323 --> 38:56.422
KRISTA: What are
you talking about?

38:56.458 --> 38:58.632
It's like two years old.
It doesn't have a scratch on it.

38:59.668 --> 39:02.130
KRISTA: What are
you laughing at?

39:02.165 --> 39:03.296
Where is it?

39:03.331 --> 39:05.199
JAMIE: It's in
the shed.

39:06.807 --> 39:09.445
KEVIN: What the fuck?

39:09.480 --> 39:10.146
Fuckin' bitch.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.041
JAMIE: Hey!
Hey man, don't.

39:14.144 --> 39:15.649
KEVIN: She's gonna
fuckin' kill you.

39:15.684 --> 39:16.483
JAMIE: No.

39:19.347 --> 39:22.051
Hey, you need some more
eye shadow, Kev.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.292
KEVIN: I don't know
if I can do this, man.

39:32.327 --> 39:34.470
JAMIE: Hey look man,
if you don't get Merv back,

39:34.505 --> 39:37.297
he's gonna have
your balls forever.

39:37.332 --> 39:38.474
You fuck him up...

39:38.509 --> 39:40.102
hey, look at me...

39:40.137 --> 39:41.642
you fuck him up,
right?

39:41.677 --> 39:43.545
He's got nothing
on you, right?

39:50.521 --> 39:52.389
Let's get
fucked up, bud.

39:53.821 --> 39:55.216
KEVIN: Fuck.

40:20.683 --> 40:22.551
JAMIE: That's
how it's done, buddy.

40:24.819 --> 40:25.653
KEVIN: Here goes
nothin'.

40:25.688 --> 40:27.149
JAMIE: All right!

40:27.184 --> 40:29.349
KEVIN: Oh God dammit!
JAMIE:

40:32.156 --> 40:33.320
JAMIE: Buddy!

40:36.666 --> 40:38.391
JAMIE: Sloppy!

40:38.426 --> 40:40.393
Fuckin' sloppy.
You're a mess.

40:40.428 --> 40:42.439
KEVIN: Just like Chicky,
buddy.

40:46.368 --> 40:48.203
KRISTA: What
did you do to it?

40:48.238 --> 40:49.644
It's not funny.

40:49.679 --> 40:51.778
Jamie,
what happened?

40:51.813 --> 40:52.779
KEVIN: It fell
out of the truck.

40:52.814 --> 40:53.780
KRISTA: You didn't
tie it on?

40:53.815 --> 40:54.881
JAMIE: Hey, I told you,
we don't need a washer.

40:54.916 --> 40:55.749
KRISTA: Then how am I
supposed to do our laundry?

40:55.784 --> 40:56.616
JAMIE: At your mother's,
for fuck sake.

40:56.651 --> 41:00.116
KRISTA: She's not
going to help us!

41:00.151 --> 41:01.150
Uhhh.

41:01.691 --> 41:03.053
Jamie!

41:04.529 --> 41:07.057
That's $150 gone,
Jamie.

41:09.798 --> 41:10.632
Jamie!

41:10.667 --> 41:12.359
JAMIE: Yeah, okay.

41:14.462 --> 41:16.803
Well, a man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do, right Kev?

41:16.838 --> 41:18.541
KRISTA: That's so stupid.

41:18.576 --> 41:19.740
JAMIE: Come on, butthead.
Come here.

41:19.775 --> 41:21.269
KRISTA: No.
JAMIE: Come on.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.480
KRISTA: No! Jamie!
Stop!

41:29.686 --> 41:31.686
JAMIE: I'm sorry,
okay?

41:37.353 --> 41:39.529
KRISTA: Jamie,

41:49.497 --> 41:50.771
JAMIE: C'mon,

41:50.806 --> 41:53.004

All right?

41:54.337 --> 41:55.776
All right, c'mon kid.

41:55.811 --> 41:57.404
Ohhh ohh oh.

42:00.783 --> 42:01.816
JAMIE: Put it on.

42:01.851 --> 42:03.245
KEVIN: Let me fuckin' get
my arms into it, idiot.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.686
It's fuckin'
upside down.

42:04.721 --> 42:05.819
JAMIE: You're not
looking half bad, man.

42:06.655 --> 42:10.417
JAMIE: All right.
Let's go. AHHH!

42:10.452 --> 42:13.255
JAMIE: Ohhh!
Fuck man!

42:13.290 --> 42:15.026
KEVIN: Fuckin'

42:27.403 --> 42:29.304
WOMEN: SURPRISE!!

42:37.215 --> 42:38.621
CHICKY: Okay, ready?
KRISTA: Yeah.

42:57.774 --> 42:59.774
KRISTA: I taught him,
Allie!

43:05.848 --> 43:07.474
CHICKY: Shhhhh!

43:15.693 --> 43:17.660
Jesus, Carol.

43:17.695 --> 43:20.124
CAROL: I just wanted
to say congrats.

43:20.159 --> 43:21.455
KRISTA: Thank you.

43:21.490 --> 43:23.457
CAROL: Oh!

43:23.492 --> 43:25.294
I think
it just kicked.

43:25.329 --> 43:27.395
KRISTA: You're pregnant?

43:27.430 --> 43:29.298
CAROL: Yah, but keep it
on the down low.

43:29.333 --> 43:31.333
Reg and me aren't
telling people just yet.

43:32.369 --> 43:34.072
But anyway,
congrats.

43:36.681 --> 43:39.308
KRISTA: She just came
to say it.

43:39.343 --> 43:40.782
He's gonna be
an ugly baby.

43:40.817 --> 43:42.509
CHICKY: Mmm.

43:52.191 --> 43:53.520
MAN: Hey,
what's up baby?

43:54.655 --> 43:55.764
JAMIE: Hey boys!

43:57.163 --> 43:58.294
JAMIE: You think
I look cute, man?

43:58.329 --> 43:59.095
MERV: What?

43:59.130 --> 44:00.527
JAMIE: You think
I look cute, huh?

44:00.562 --> 44:02.496
EVERYONE: Ohhh!!

44:02.531 --> 44:04.773
JAMIE: Kev, come here.
Kev. Come on.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.137
Shit.

44:08.339 --> 44:11.637
JAMIE: You fuckin'...

44:11.672 --> 44:14.112
You touch him again,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

44:14.147 --> 44:15.575
HANK: You gonna let Jamie fight
all your wars for you buddy?

44:15.610 --> 44:17.313
JAMIE: Hey! Back off!
Hey! don't touch him.

44:17.348 --> 44:18.787
Let's go.
Let's go, go!

44:24.124 --> 44:26.762
KRISTA and CHICKY:

44:26.797 --> 44:28.621
CHICKY: Shhh!
Be quiet.

44:39.502 --> 44:40.468
KRISTA: Oh my God.

44:40.503 --> 44:41.169
CHICKY: You lost.

44:41.204 --> 44:42.635
KRISTA: Nooo!
CHICKY: Yes.

44:44.815 --> 44:47.343
KRISTA: What are you
gonna say when you see Reg?

44:48.346 --> 44:50.687
CHICKY: Congratu-
fuckin'-lations.

44:52.185 --> 44:53.822
KRISTA: You should
get pregnant too.

44:53.857 --> 44:56.055
CHICKY: I've been on the pill
since I was 16.

44:56.827 --> 44:59.520
KRISTA: I can't wait
to have Jamie's babies.

45:04.802 --> 45:07.264
CHICKY: Don't marry him.

45:10.665 --> 45:13.039
CHICKY: I'm serious.

45:13.074 --> 45:14.667
He can be so hard.
You've seen him be hard.

45:14.702 --> 45:16.669
KRISTA: He won't be
like that when he's happy.

45:16.704 --> 45:19.144
With you?

45:19.179 --> 45:21.146
KRISTA: Yeah,
with me.

45:21.181 --> 45:22.312
He wants
to marry me.

45:22.347 --> 45:23.511
CHICKY: Mmm
KRISTA: Yeah.

45:23.546 --> 45:25.480
CHICKY: Why?

45:25.515 --> 45:27.383
CHICKY: Why?

45:29.354 --> 45:30.253
CHICKY: Jesus.

45:30.289 --> 45:33.059
If he marries you,
he's never gonna leave.

45:33.094 --> 45:34.192
KRISTA: Yeah,
why should he leave?

45:34.227 --> 45:35.026
He's got
a job here.

45:35.061 --> 45:36.689
CHICKY: He told Earl
he's quitting.

45:38.627 --> 45:41.034
Krista, would you
go with him

45:41.069 --> 45:43.234
if he ever got work
someplace else?

45:46.811 --> 45:49.042
Wait one year.

45:49.077 --> 45:51.077
Have the wedding
next year.

45:51.112 --> 45:52.309
KRISTA: I can't.

45:52.344 --> 45:54.641
CHICKY: Why not?

45:54.676 --> 45:56.379
KRISTA: He loves...

45:57.822 --> 45:59.580
CHICKY: They all do.

45:59.615 --> 46:01.791
What good
does that do you?

46:06.787 --> 46:08.325
CHICKY: Krista!

46:11.330 --> 46:12.659
JAMIE: Hey man.

46:14.333 --> 46:15.761
He knows why
we did it, all right?

46:15.796 --> 46:18.335
That's all that
fuckin' matters.

46:20.339 --> 46:21.767
KEVIN: Well he's gonna
try to get you back now.

46:21.802 --> 46:24.473
JAMIE: Yeah.

46:24.508 --> 46:28.147
Yeah, I...

46:28.182 --> 46:30.479
I don't really
give a shit.

46:30.514 --> 46:32.382
I'm fuckin'

47:20.432 --> 47:22.300
Nova Scotia,

47:24.502 --> 47:27.338
No, I'm really
interested

47:27.373 --> 47:29.538
in joining your heli-logging
team, all right?

47:31.509 --> 47:32.673
Pilot.

47:33.808 --> 47:37.051
No, no, sorry --

47:37.086 --> 47:40.549
You know, the training

47:40.584 --> 47:41.748
You know, I'd be
one of those guys

47:41.783 --> 47:45.521

Yeah, yeah.

47:45.556 --> 47:47.325
Now listen, listen, I've got
a shit ton of experience

47:47.360 --> 47:49.261
in the woods.

47:49.296 --> 47:50.592
I've worked
the processor,

47:50.627 --> 47:53.760
it'll be fuckin'
four years now, right?

47:53.795 --> 47:56.235
So, you know, that's
-- like I said,

47:56.270 --> 47:57.764
I got a ton of
experience.

48:01.473 --> 48:06.146
Yeah. Yeah,
I've worked chainsaw but --

48:06.181 --> 48:08.412
look, listen,

48:08.447 --> 48:10.777
I'm looking to do

48:10.812 --> 48:12.350
all right,

48:18.820 --> 48:20.028
Well...

48:21.790 --> 48:24.329

48:27.796 --> 48:29.334
Yeah, sure.

48:52.425 --> 48:54.590
and he's looking to do
the heli-logging too,

48:54.625 --> 48:56.658
and this guy,
I mean he's...

48:56.693 --> 48:58.033
he's got more
experience than me,

48:58.068 --> 49:00.233
so it shouldn't
fuckin' matter, but...

49:02.534 --> 49:06.569
he didn't graduate
from high school.

49:06.604 --> 49:10.144
Right? But he's got
the GED thing.

49:14.678 --> 49:17.349
Yeah. Right.
Well, I mean...

49:17.384 --> 49:19.714

Yeah, right.

Wait, $4,000?

CHICKY: Yeah?
KEVIN: Yeah.

50:54.514 --> 50:56.679
CHICKY: Why are you in such
a hurry to mess yourself up?

51:00.817 --> 51:02.487
CHICKY: Not

51:02.522 --> 51:04.192

51:17.339 --> 51:19.141
Give me
a kiss first.

51:19.176 --> 51:20.769
CHICKY: No.

51:20.804 --> 51:24.003
Can I... please?
Thank you.

51:25.578 --> 51:29.118
A baby porcupine.
Oh, it's cute.

51:29.153 --> 51:30.779
KEVIN: Yeah, well

51:30.814 --> 51:33.419
CHICKY: Kev, you're really

51:33.454 --> 51:35.322
KEVIN: Not good

51:40.692 --> 51:41.757
Come on Chicky,

51:42.793 --> 51:44.694
CHICKY: Kevin!
Jesus!

51:44.729 --> 51:47.433
You don't have to...
prove anything to me, okay?

51:48.337 --> 51:49.633
KEVIN: What the fuck
does that mean?

51:49.668 --> 51:50.766
CHICKY: Nothing.
KEVIN: Prove what?

51:50.801 --> 51:51.767
CHICKY: Nothing!

51:51.802 --> 51:53.175
KEVIN: No! What the fuck
did they say about me?

51:53.210 --> 51:54.638
CHICKY: No,

54:42.346 --> 54:44.346
Hey, what's that?
What is that?

54:47.681 --> 54:49.142
JAMIE: What the fuck

54:49.177 --> 54:51.045
CLARENCE: Same as you.

Hey, hey.

55:03.796 --> 55:06.467
JAMIE: Hey, listen...

55:06.502 --> 55:08.667
what'd I want to be
when I grew up, huh?

55:11.166 --> 55:13.342
CLARENCE: Trav wanted
to be a soldier.

55:15.170 --> 55:17.643
JAMIE: Yeah.

55:17.678 --> 55:19.040
Yeah.

55:19.812 --> 55:21.350
JAMIE: Hey!

55:25.345 --> 55:28.214
Why'd you put me
in retarded math, man?

55:29.349 --> 55:30.689
You...

55:32.693 --> 55:35.023

teachers fuck me.

55:36.499 --> 55:38.367
Hey! Wait.

55:41.504 --> 55:43.372
Why?

55:45.673 --> 55:49.070
CLARENCE: What was
I supposed to do?

55:49.105 --> 55:50.742
When those teachers
told me,

55:50.777 --> 55:54.812
"You put Jamie in this class,
he'll get better marks," hey?

55:54.847 --> 55:57.210
I was...

55:57.245 --> 55:59.718
my wife left me,
my son died.

55:59.753 --> 56:02.721
He died. What was
I supposed to do?

57:15.323 --> 57:17.532
REG: Hey Jamie.

57:17.567 --> 57:18.467

JAMIE: Yeah.

57:26.741 --> 57:28.334
REG: Well I was up there,
I was checking out the site,

57:28.369 --> 57:31.139
and uh...

57:31.174 --> 57:32.239
it's Trav's grave.

57:33.341 --> 57:34.450
REG: Somebody
fucked it up.

57:35.442 --> 57:37.486
REG: There's like a spot
next to the headstone,

57:37.521 --> 57:38.520
like a hole's
been dug,

57:38.555 --> 57:39.721
and then there's
a pile a dirt

57:39.756 --> 57:41.457
like whoever dug the hole
was trying to fill it back up.

57:43.692 --> 57:44.790
REG: You hearing me?

57:44.825 --> 57:46.024
JAMIE: Yeah, yeah.

57:46.060 --> 57:48.354

58:14.822 --> 58:16.316
JAMIE: Hey, Dad?

58:16.351 --> 58:17.251
KRISTA: Jame.

58:17.286 --> 58:19.154
JAMIE: Is he here,
or...

58:19.189 --> 58:21.530
KRISTA: No. Why?

58:32.334 --> 58:34.136
KRISTA: They're cold,
Jamie.

58:34.171 --> 58:35.137
JAMIE: Yeah.

58:35.172 --> 58:37.238
KRISTA: You've gotta stop
doing that, Fuzzy.

58:37.273 --> 58:39.042
JAMIE: Hey, don't.

58:39.077 --> 58:39.779
Don't you call
me that. Don't.

58:39.814 --> 58:40.680
KRISTA: Chicky does.

58:40.715 --> 58:42.683
JAMIE: I don't want you to,
all right?

58:50.187 --> 58:51.527
JAMIE: Come here.

59:01.495 --> 59:04.133
Say my name.

59:04.168 --> 59:05.497
KRISTA: Why?

59:07.534 --> 59:11.437
JAMIE: Well Mom said,
"Jamie" like,

59:11.472 --> 59:13.780
"What are you up to
now, you little shit?"

59:13.815 --> 59:15.243
KRISTA: Oh, Jamie.

59:15.278 --> 59:20.545
JAMIE: And then
Clarence he...

59:20.580 --> 59:23.449
Clarence says Jamie, like not
Trav, you know? Like um ...

59:23.484 --> 59:27.321
KRISTA: Jamie, stop. Stop.
Jamie.

59:27.356 --> 59:29.664
JAMIE: There.

59:29.699 --> 59:31.226
KRISTA: What?

59:32.669 --> 59:35.197
JAMIE: Even when
you're pissed with me, you...

59:37.267 --> 59:38.299
you say Jamie like...

59:38.334 --> 59:40.202
KRISTA: Like what?

59:40.809 --> 59:43.645
Jamie.

59:43.680 --> 59:46.043
JAMIE: Yeah, like that.
Like...

59:48.278 --> 59:52.478
like there's a chance
of something in me.

59:52.513 --> 59:54.150
Jamie.

59:54.185 --> 59:58.319
Jamie. Jamie.

59:58.354 --> 1:00:00.189
Want to?

1:00:00.224 --> 1:00:03.489
JAMIE: No, no, no.

1:00:03.524 --> 1:00:05.392
I'm saving myself
for marriage.

1:00:11.499 --> 1:00:12.674
I...

1:00:15.371 --> 1:00:18.647
I've got to take a trip
to the vet before supper.

1:00:18.682 --> 1:00:21.441
Sky's not looking too good.
His eyes are all milky,

1:00:21.476 --> 1:00:23.146
he's loosing
his feathers.

1:00:23.181 --> 1:00:25.687
KRISTA: Half of
what you rescue dies.

1:00:28.186 --> 1:00:30.186
Is that why
you're quitting?

1:00:32.190 --> 1:00:36.291
Chicky told me.

1:00:36.326 --> 1:00:38.799
JAMIE: Babe, I don't work
chainsaw, okay? I can't.

1:00:38.834 --> 1:00:40.229
KRISTA: Jamie, that
don't make no sense.

1:00:40.264 --> 1:00:41.296
You hate what
the processor does,

1:00:41.331 --> 1:00:42.770
but you won't work
chainsaw?

1:00:42.805 --> 1:00:45.432
Jamie, you gotta
have a job.

1:00:45.467 --> 1:00:48.776
Jamie, look at me!
What is going on?!

1:00:48.811 --> 1:00:49.810
Why did you quit,
Jamie?

1:00:49.846 --> 1:00:51.141
JAMIE: Krista, in 10 years
there won't be jobs

1:00:51.176 --> 1:00:54.210
here anymore,
okay?

1:00:54.245 --> 1:00:58.544
Babe, in 10 years there won't be
fuckin' trees in this valley.

1:00:58.579 --> 1:00:59.378
KRISTA: What are
you talking about?

1:00:59.413 --> 1:01:00.513
It's like woods
all the way to town.

1:01:00.548 --> 1:01:02.350
That's like
40 kilometers.

1:01:02.385 --> 1:01:03.824
JAMIE: No. No babe,

1:01:03.859 --> 1:01:06.585
then you don't know what
you're looking at, all right.

1:01:06.620 --> 1:01:09.324
All along the road,
that's not woods anymore.

1:01:09.359 --> 1:01:11.524
What you're seeing,
it's...

1:01:11.559 --> 1:01:13.196
it's a screen of trees,
all right?

1:01:13.231 --> 1:01:16.100
Maybe two,
three tiers deep,

1:01:16.135 --> 1:01:18.366
and behind that
is hectares

1:01:18.401 --> 1:01:20.566
and hectares
of clear cut.

1:01:20.601 --> 1:01:22.667
Everything
has just been

1:01:22.702 --> 1:01:25.571
chewed up and
spit right out.

1:01:29.346 --> 1:01:32.314
That's why...

1:01:32.349 --> 1:01:34.316
listen I...

1:01:34.351 --> 1:01:35.449
KRISTA: What?

1:01:35.484 --> 1:01:37.726
JAMIE: No, don't.
Just...

1:01:37.761 --> 1:01:40.520
I'm not saying we could
afford to do it right away,

1:01:40.555 --> 1:01:42.489
okay, but ...

1:01:42.524 --> 1:01:45.129
KRISTA: Okay.
What?

1:01:45.164 --> 1:01:46.768
KEVIN: Clarence!

1:01:46.803 --> 1:01:49.001
Hey, Clarence!

1:01:51.335 --> 1:01:53.302
Where the fuck's
Clarence?

1:01:53.337 --> 1:01:55.469
Huh?
Is he here?

1:01:55.504 --> 1:01:58.208
CHICKY: Kevin,
what the hell is going on?

1:02:00.344 --> 1:02:01.607
KEVIN: They're burying
Betty's boy tomorrow.

1:02:01.642 --> 1:02:04.379
CHICKY: Yeah.

1:02:04.414 --> 1:02:06.711
KEVIN: And Reg went
to check the grave site,

1:02:06.746 --> 1:02:08.790
and they've been fuckin'
with Trav's grave.

1:02:08.825 --> 1:02:11.155
CHICKY: What?

1:02:11.190 --> 1:02:12.156
Who has?

1:02:12.191 --> 1:02:14.158
KEVIN: Merv.
Fuckin' Merv.

1:02:14.193 --> 1:02:16.094
CHICKY: Why would he mess
with Trav's grave?

1:02:16.129 --> 1:02:17.458
KEVIN: He got his fuckin'
ass kicked at Jamie's stag,

1:02:17.493 --> 1:02:18.459
so he's paying
him back.

1:02:18.494 --> 1:02:19.295
CHICKY: Jamie?

1:02:19.330 --> 1:02:21.462
KEVIN: Fuck!

1:02:21.497 --> 1:02:22.771
JAMIE: Kev...

1:02:22.806 --> 1:02:24.498
you go get sod
from Reg, okay?

1:02:24.533 --> 1:02:25.365
KEVIN: What about Merv?

1:02:25.401 --> 1:02:26.467
CHICKY: You don't even
know it was him.

1:02:26.502 --> 1:02:28.304
KEVIN: He did it!

1:02:28.339 --> 1:02:30.306
Jamie, I know it
he fuckin' did it.

1:02:30.341 --> 1:02:33.144
JAMIE: Meet me
at the grave, all right?

1:02:33.179 --> 1:02:34.343
We'll make it look like
nothing happened

1:02:34.378 --> 1:02:36.081
for Betty tomorrow.

1:02:36.512 --> 1:02:38.215
KEVIN: No, man,
I got it.

1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:42.318
Then I'm gonna get
that son of a bitch.

1:02:42.353 --> 1:02:43.792
CHICKY: Jamie?

1:02:43.827 --> 1:02:46.487
You seen Dad?

1:02:46.522 --> 1:02:47.323
Jamie!

1:02:52.495 --> 1:02:53.161
CHICKY: I don't think
even Merv

1:02:53.196 --> 1:02:55.199
would do
something like that.

1:02:56.796 --> 1:02:58.763
JAMIE: It don't matter
to Kev who did it.

1:02:58.798 --> 1:03:01.073
He needs it
to be Merv.

1:03:01.108 --> 1:03:02.470
He's gotta
take him on,

1:03:02.505 --> 1:03:05.671
if he wants to fuckin'
live around here anyway.

1:03:09.182 --> 1:03:10.511
CHICKY: Jesus.

1:03:12.680 --> 1:03:13.579
You find out
who did it

1:03:13.615 --> 1:03:16.121
and I'll beat the crap
outta them myself.

1:03:19.522 --> 1:03:22.061
CHICKY: What are we gonna do
when Clarence finds out, hmm?

1:03:24.329 --> 1:03:26.197
JAMIE: Fuck,
I don't know.

1:03:29.796 --> 1:03:31.334
CHICKY: Jamie?

1:03:33.503 --> 1:03:34.202
Jamie?!

1:03:34.237 --> 1:03:36.141
JAMIE: Yeah, what, huh?
What?

1:03:36.176 --> 1:03:37.670
CHICKY: Jesus.

1:03:37.705 --> 1:03:40.244
I can't stand
living with you sometimes.

1:03:41.511 --> 1:03:43.115
JAMIE: What the fuck
do you want me to do, huh?

1:03:43.150 --> 1:03:44.116
CHICKY: Act like
you have feelings,

1:03:44.151 --> 1:03:44.710
a fuckin' heart.

1:03:44.745 --> 1:03:47.317
JAMIE: Ah, fuck off.

1:03:47.352 --> 1:03:49.682
CHICKY: You didn't use
to be like this before.

1:03:51.356 --> 1:03:53.224
JAMIE: Before when, huh?

1:03:55.690 --> 1:03:58.196
CHICKY: I don't know.

1:03:58.231 --> 1:04:00.462
Before Trav died.

1:04:00.497 --> 1:04:03.036
Before you quit school,
started drinking every day.

1:04:07.801 --> 1:04:10.307
JAMIE: You know what
I feel these days?

1:04:10.342 --> 1:04:11.539
CHICKY: What?

1:04:11.574 --> 1:04:14.212
JAMIE: Nothing.

1:04:14.247 --> 1:04:14.806
CHICKY: Why don't
you just tell me.

1:04:14.841 --> 1:04:17.314
JAMIE: No, nothing.

1:04:17.349 --> 1:04:21.615
You know, shaking
inside that machine.

1:04:21.650 --> 1:04:24.189
Hearing everything outside
just get tore up.

1:04:28.822 --> 1:04:30.459
No.
Jesus Christ.

1:04:34.498 --> 1:04:36.498
CHICKY: Call that
heli-logging yet?

1:04:38.436 --> 1:04:39.765
JAMIE: Yeah.

1:04:41.505 --> 1:04:43.802
CHICKY: So you're going?

1:04:43.837 --> 1:04:46.376
JAMIE: Soon as I get the money
together, yeah. Yeah.

1:04:47.346 --> 1:04:48.642
CHICKY: You quit
your job.

1:04:48.677 --> 1:04:49.743
JAMIE: Jesus.

1:04:49.778 --> 1:04:50.744
Danny's renting the trailer
'til spring, all right?

1:04:50.779 --> 1:04:51.979
We'll have enough
to get out there by then.

1:04:52.014 --> 1:04:55.220
CHICKY: You might have paid off
the fuckin' wedding by then.

1:04:55.816 --> 1:04:58.025
JAMIE: Fuckin', you and Krista.
CHICKY: Why  are you...

1:04:59.358 --> 1:05:00.291
JAMIE: What?

1:05:00.326 --> 1:05:02.392
CHICKY: Why the fuck
are you marrying her?

1:05:06.134 --> 1:05:07.430
JAMIE: 'Cause I need
one person out there

1:05:07.465 --> 1:05:08.598
who fuckin'
knows me.

1:05:08.633 --> 1:05:09.565
CHICKY: You marry her, and
she'll stop you from going.

1:05:09.601 --> 1:05:12.138
JAMIE: No. No, no, no.
Krista's going too.

1:05:12.173 --> 1:05:13.139
Don't -- don't ...

1:05:13.174 --> 1:05:14.073
CHICKY: Jesus, you're
a stupid married man,

1:05:14.109 --> 1:05:16.340
and you're not even
fuckin' married yet.

1:05:18.311 --> 1:05:20.245
JAMIE: You know sis,

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:23.413
old Reg, he's just
using you up.

1:05:23.448 --> 1:05:26.317
What the fuck are you
sticking around for, huh?

1:05:26.352 --> 1:05:27.318
CHICKY: Fuck you.

1:05:27.353 --> 1:05:29.056
JAMIE: No fuck you.

1:05:34.822 --> 1:05:36.525
JAMIE: Fuck off.

1:05:43.798 --> 1:05:47.008
CHICKY: You can't save something
that's half dead, Jame.

1:05:51.674 --> 1:05:55.115
JAMIE: Fuck, I'm tired.
How 'bout you?

1:05:55.150 --> 1:05:56.710
CHICKY: Get outta here.

1:06:58.345 --> 1:07:00.345
JAMIE: All right, it's okay.
You can go.

1:07:02.448 --> 1:07:04.151
You can go.
Go on.

1:07:05.418 --> 1:07:07.022
Go on, Sky.

1:07:16.561 --> 1:07:19.232
BANK MANAGER: What size of loan
are you thinking about here?

1:07:19.267 --> 1:07:20.101
JAMIE: 40K.

1:07:20.136 --> 1:07:21.432
BANK MANAGER: 40K, okay.

1:07:21.467 --> 1:07:23.137
And business,
personal?

1:07:23.172 --> 1:07:26.140
JAMIE: Yeah, personal.
Yeah, yeah.

1:07:26.175 --> 1:07:27.669
BANK MANAGER: Personal, okay.
And right now, ballpark,

1:07:27.704 --> 1:07:31.112
what would you say
your annual income is?

1:07:31.147 --> 1:07:34.181
JAMIE: 20, maybe 24K.

1:07:34.216 --> 1:07:36.183
BANK MANAGER: 24? Okay.
Okay, great.

1:07:36.218 --> 1:07:37.382
Well let me bring up
your account here

1:07:37.417 --> 1:07:39.450
and I'll see
what we can find out.

1:07:39.485 --> 1:07:41.650
Okay. So, you don't have
a whole lot of credit history

1:07:41.685 --> 1:07:42.718
that I'm seeing here.

1:07:42.753 --> 1:07:43.784
You don't have any
credit cards, lines of credit,

1:07:43.819 --> 1:07:44.518
anything like that.

1:07:44.553 --> 1:07:45.652
JAMIE: No.
No, nothing, yeah.

1:07:45.688 --> 1:07:46.754
BANK MANAGER: Okay. Well
that makes it a bit trickier,

1:07:46.789 --> 1:07:47.888
but it's not impossible.
With your income right now,

1:07:47.923 --> 1:07:50.230
and no credit history it means
you'll need a guarantor.

1:07:51.233 --> 1:07:53.530
Oh, sorry, a guarantor
is a co-signer,

1:07:53.565 --> 1:07:54.664
someone who'll vouch for you
and sign with you.

1:07:54.700 --> 1:07:57.237
JAMIE: Oh yeah, well,
I'm getting married, so yeah.

1:07:57.272 --> 1:07:58.667
BANK MANAGER: Oh hey, great,
yeah. Congrats.

1:07:58.702 --> 1:07:59.401
JAMIE: Yeah,
thanks so ...

1:07:59.436 --> 1:08:00.669
BANK MANAGER: All right,
okay.

1:08:00.704 --> 1:08:03.441
So your guarantor just needs to
be someone who's at least 18,

1:08:03.476 --> 1:08:06.477
and who has an annual salary
of about $35,000.

1:08:06.512 --> 1:08:10.283
For most people your age,
that would be a parent.

1:08:10.318 --> 1:08:11.680
Could that be
an option for you?

1:08:14.157 --> 1:08:16.421
JAMIE: Yeah, let's do it.
All right.

1:08:16.456 --> 1:08:18.489
BANK MANAGER: Great.
Okay.

1:08:23.166 --> 1:08:24.396
JAMIE: Dad!

1:08:24.431 --> 1:08:25.760
Dad!

1:08:54.692 --> 1:08:57.330
JAMIE: Fuck you!

1:08:57.365 --> 1:09:00.025
You fucker.
Fuck.

1:09:42.806 --> 1:09:44.773
KRISTA: Hey,
you look nice, Chick.

1:10:09.800 --> 1:10:12.306
JAMIE: You ready?

1:10:12.341 --> 1:10:13.439
KRISTA: Yeah.

1:10:13.474 --> 1:10:14.803
JAMIE: Yeah?

1:10:18.677 --> 1:10:20.611
JAMIE: Hey, wait.

1:10:20.646 --> 1:10:23.284
KRISTA: I can't wait.

1:10:30.524 --> 1:10:44.371
JAMIE: and KRISTA:

1:10:58.684 --> 1:11:01.487
KRISTA: Okay. Jamie and Kev.
No, no! You're not wrestling.

1:11:01.522 --> 1:11:02.356
KEVIN: Can we fight?

1:11:02.391 --> 1:11:03.654
KRISTA: No!

1:11:06.186 --> 1:11:08.362
KRISTA: All right,
go 'round the back.

1:11:11.697 --> 1:11:14.335
KRISTA: If you guys
just want to stand together.

1:11:14.370 --> 1:11:16.370
You're looking good.

1:11:24.809 --> 1:11:27.139
KRISTA: Just so we get one
of like, the front.

1:11:29.242 --> 1:11:31.616
KRISTA: Chicky, maybe
help me check my make-up?

1:11:33.180 --> 1:11:36.819
JAMIE: Jesus Christ, man.
It's fuckin' unreal, bud.

1:11:36.854 --> 1:11:38.557
Fuckin' unreal.

1:11:39.692 --> 1:11:41.219
KEVIN: Jamie?

1:11:42.365 --> 1:11:44.431
I'm gonna get
Merv tonight.

1:11:49.669 --> 1:11:51.669
JAMIE: Okay, man.
You...

1:11:53.805 --> 1:11:56.003
you handle it,
all right.

1:11:57.512 --> 1:11:59.039
All right.

1:12:14.353 --> 1:12:16.221
JAMIE: I don't
even know...

1:12:18.797 --> 1:12:21.633
you know, I'm sure Trav
would love to know

1:12:21.668 --> 1:12:25.197
you was digging up
his fuckin' jersey, man you...

1:12:29.170 --> 1:12:30.510
Why?

1:12:32.613 --> 1:12:34.338
I mean, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

1:12:34.373 --> 1:12:36.307
Why would
you do that, huh?

1:12:36.342 --> 1:12:37.308
CLARENCE: He was
my son.

1:12:39.851 --> 1:12:41.312
Yeah, your son.

1:12:41.347 --> 1:12:43.314
CLARENCE: What I did
didn't hurt Trav none.

1:12:43.349 --> 1:12:45.426
JAMIE: Oh Travis.

1:12:45.461 --> 1:12:47.186
Travis, Travis, Travis, Travis,
Travis, Travis, Travis...

1:12:47.221 --> 1:12:48.594
CLARENCE: He knows
I did it 'cause I missed

1:12:48.629 --> 1:12:49.760
watching the games
together.

1:12:49.795 --> 1:12:51.498
JAMIE: Fuck,
come on, man!

1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:56.635
You know, if Trav
was alive right now

1:12:56.670 --> 1:12:58.769
he'd be cursing you out,
same as me...

1:12:58.804 --> 1:13:01.332
CLARENCE: He would not be.
He wouldn't.

1:13:03.336 --> 1:13:04.676
JAMIE: Look at me.

1:13:10.816 --> 1:13:13.685
You're nothing
to me.

1:13:16.184 --> 1:13:18.690
KRISTA: Jamie, c'mon.
Let's go.

1:13:49.690 --> 1:13:52.559
KRISTA: I promise to
support and care for you,

1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:55.727
to stand
by your side

1:13:55.762 --> 1:13:58.290
and always
be there for you,

1:13:59.667 --> 1:14:01.766
no matter
what happens,

1:14:01.801 --> 1:14:04.637
what challenges
we face.

1:14:04.672 --> 1:14:07.772
I will always
love you.

1:14:07.807 --> 1:14:09.576
You and me

1:14:09.611 --> 1:14:11.611
against the world.

1:14:11.646 --> 1:14:13.074
MINISTER: And Jamie,
do you take Krista,

1:14:13.109 --> 1:14:15.109
to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

1:14:15.144 --> 1:14:17.650
To love, serve,
and protect,

1:14:17.685 --> 1:14:19.652
in sickness
and in health

1:14:19.687 --> 1:14:21.346
'til death
do you part?

1:14:22.349 --> 1:14:23.081
Jamie?

1:14:23.117 --> 1:14:25.526
JAMIE: Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I do.

1:14:38.541 --> 1:14:39.672
EARL: Yeah, you're
the spitting image

1:14:39.707 --> 1:14:42.235
of your old man on
his big day.

1:15:25.346 --> 1:15:26.312
JAMIE: 80K a year, man.

1:15:26.347 --> 1:15:27.786
Just gotta know
some basic math.

1:15:27.821 --> 1:15:28.787
Fuckin' easy shit.

1:15:28.822 --> 1:15:29.755
Yeah.

1:15:29.790 --> 1:15:31.119
Maybe you'll finally
be able to fix that leak

1:15:31.154 --> 1:15:32.417
in the trailer, huh?

1:15:32.452 --> 1:15:33.484
JAMIE: Yeah.

1:15:33.519 --> 1:15:36.487
DANNY: Yeah.
Fuckin' B.C. Jame.

1:15:36.522 --> 1:15:38.060
I'm proud of you, bud.

1:15:44.497 --> 1:15:46.673
KRISTA: What are
you two girls talking about?

1:15:46.708 --> 1:15:48.235
DANNY: You two heading
to B.C., Krista.

1:15:48.270 --> 1:15:49.203
KRISTA: What?

1:15:49.238 --> 1:15:51.238
DANNY: Congrats!
I mean it.

1:15:51.273 --> 1:15:54.076
KRISTA: We're not going
to B.C. Right Jamie?

1:15:59.347 --> 1:16:01.215
KRISTA: Jamie,
we're not going to B.C.

1:16:02.185 --> 1:16:03.756
We got land here.

1:16:07.828 --> 1:16:09.696
JAMIE: Am I
like my dad?

1:16:11.832 --> 1:16:13.359
KRISTA: Jamie...

1:16:18.564 --> 1:16:20.135
KRISTA: Jamie.

1:16:22.678 --> 1:16:25.613
DANNY: Don't worry about him.
He'll walk it off.

1:16:26.341 --> 1:16:27.714
KRISTA: Jamie?

1:16:27.749 --> 1:16:29.408
Jamie!

1:16:31.819 --> 1:16:33.313
JAMIE: All right,
get in.

1:17:33.342 --> 1:17:35.045
KEVIN: Ohhhh.

1:17:38.512 --> 1:17:40.479
Ohhhh.

1:18:07.673 --> 1:18:09.541
KRISTA: Jamie,
you're scaring me.

1:18:19.828 --> 1:18:23.027
JAMIE: I love you.
I love you.

1:19:38.170 --> 1:19:40.467
JAMIE: Hey.

1:19:40.502 --> 1:19:42.205
CHICKY: What you
doing down here?

1:19:43.802 --> 1:19:45.670
JAMIE: Down here
in the dark's where I fit.

1:19:45.705 --> 1:19:47.474
CHICKY: Yeah?
Where's Krista?

1:19:47.509 --> 1:19:51.313
JAMIE: Ahhh.
She...

1:19:51.348 --> 1:19:53.381
she don't wanna ruin that
white thing she's wearing.

1:19:53.416 --> 1:19:56.054
CHICKY: Mmm. Wow.
What's that?

1:19:56.089 --> 1:19:57.583
Three hours
of wedded bliss?

1:19:58.685 --> 1:20:00.289
JAMIE: Yeah.

1:20:00.324 --> 1:20:01.653
Yeah, yeah.

1:20:07.166 --> 1:20:08.495
CHICKY: I'm going.

1:20:11.170 --> 1:20:13.302
JAMIE: Oh, yeah?

1:20:13.337 --> 1:20:13.869
CHICKY: Yeah.

1:20:13.904 --> 1:20:15.568
JAMIE: Where are you...

1:20:15.603 --> 1:20:17.438
where you going to?

1:20:17.473 --> 1:20:20.573
CHICKY: No idea.
Just away.

1:20:20.608 --> 1:20:22.476
JAMIE: You taking
Reg with you?

1:20:25.613 --> 1:20:27.481
CHICKY: I'm a lay
to him.

1:20:34.358 --> 1:20:37.062
CHICKY: Here.
Maybe Krista'd like it.

1:20:40.496 --> 1:20:42.793
I'm scared.

1:20:42.828 --> 1:20:43.627
If I'm still here
tomorrow

1:20:43.662 --> 1:20:46.533
and he comes around
smiling, so...

1:20:46.568 --> 1:20:48.634
I'm going.

1:20:51.804 --> 1:20:54.178
JAMIE: Good, sis.

1:20:54.213 --> 1:20:55.773
Yeah,
good on ya.

1:20:55.808 --> 1:20:56.774
CHICKY: What about you?

1:20:56.809 --> 1:20:59.645
JAMIE: Oh.

1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:02.615
Ohhh.

1:21:02.650 --> 1:21:04.089
CHICKY: What if
I get a place,

1:21:04.124 --> 1:21:05.651
out by
the heli-logging, hmm?

1:21:05.686 --> 1:21:07.719
You and Krista
come stay with me.

1:21:07.754 --> 1:21:10.788
JAMIE: Yeah. Yeah,
sounds good, sis.

1:21:10.823 --> 1:21:12.328
CHICKY: I mean it.

1:21:12.363 --> 1:21:13.791
JAMIE: Fucking eh, huh?

1:21:15.795 --> 1:21:17.498
CHICKY: You're
married now.

1:21:19.370 --> 1:21:21.601
We can leave
together?

1:21:21.636 --> 1:21:24.472
JAMIE: Yeah. Yeah,
next spring, all right?

1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:27.508
CHICKY: Why not now?

1:21:29.677 --> 1:21:33.085
JAMIE: Do you know how much
it costs to fly a helicopter

1:21:33.120 --> 1:21:35.351
from this life
to a new one?

1:21:35.386 --> 1:21:36.118
CHICKY: You called
and you...

1:21:36.154 --> 1:21:38.453
JAMIE: Forty
thousand dollars.

1:21:38.488 --> 1:21:39.784
CHICKY: Fuzzy,
that...

1:21:39.819 --> 1:21:42.820
JAMIE: Yeah.

1:21:42.855 --> 1:21:44.459
Yeah, I...

1:21:46.760 --> 1:21:49.035
I don't even have
the GED, Chick.

1:21:53.338 --> 1:21:55.437
I'm a clown.

1:21:56.275 --> 1:21:59.804
I keep trying to convince
myself I'm good,

1:21:59.839 --> 1:22:02.015
you know,
but I know.

1:22:08.815 --> 1:22:11.255
Why am I like this?

1:22:11.290 --> 1:22:14.423
CHICKY: Jamie,
you can learn that math.

1:22:14.458 --> 1:22:15.090
You're not dumb.

1:22:15.126 --> 1:22:17.525
JAMIE: Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

1:22:20.827 --> 1:22:23.234
CHICKY: I can't wait
'til next spring.

1:22:25.337 --> 1:22:28.041
I gotta go...

1:22:28.076 --> 1:22:30.406
before I fall down
that Reg well all over again.

1:22:44.818 --> 1:22:47.093
JAMIE: You going
or what, huh?

1:22:49.823 --> 1:22:50.822
CHICKY: I'll call.

1:22:50.857 --> 1:22:52.428
JAMIE: Yeah.

1:22:55.697 --> 1:22:57.664
Hey! Hey.

1:23:03.309 --> 1:23:05.639
You were a mother of
a sister to me, Chicky.

1:23:08.677 --> 1:23:10.215
CHICKY: Krista's
problem now.

1:23:12.780 --> 1:23:14.681
JAMIE: Yeah.

1:24:31.529 --> 1:24:32.660
Jamie?

1:24:35.797 --> 1:24:37.533
Jamie!

1:24:37.568 --> 1:24:39.799
Jamie,
look at my dress!

1:24:39.834 --> 1:24:42.307
It's ruined!

1:24:42.342 --> 1:24:44.276
Mud won't come out
either, Jamie.

1:24:45.180 --> 1:24:46.344
Jamie.

1:24:47.512 --> 1:24:48.676
Jamie.

1:24:50.185 --> 1:24:51.547
Jamie!

1:24:51.582 --> 1:24:55.287
JAMIE: Hey! Nice dress.
You look like a ghost.

1:24:56.620 --> 1:24:58.752
KRISTA: It's wrecked
thanks to you.

1:24:58.787 --> 1:25:00.721
Get down here, Jamie.
Get your shoes on.

1:25:00.756 --> 1:25:01.821
JAMIE: You're not
the boss of me, woman!

1:25:01.856 --> 1:25:03.229
KRISTA: You were the one
telling everyone

1:25:03.264 --> 1:25:04.593
we were going to
B.C., Jamie.

1:25:04.628 --> 1:25:06.661
I never said
I would go to B.C.!

1:25:07.730 --> 1:25:08.596
KRISTA: Don't be
doing that!

1:25:08.631 --> 1:25:10.632
You're not jumping, Jamie,
you hear me?

1:25:10.667 --> 1:25:13.140
YOU - ARE - NOT - JUMPING!

1:25:13.876 --> 1:25:15.274
KRISTA: Jamie,
if you jump,

1:25:15.309 --> 1:25:17.309
I'm never going
to talk to you again!

1:25:17.344 --> 1:25:18.772
I'll be like Chicky's
being to me,

1:25:18.807 --> 1:25:20.312
for the rest of our lives,
Jamie.

1:25:20.347 --> 1:25:22.776
I - WON'T - TALK TO YOU!

1:25:22.811 --> 1:25:24.481
JAMIE!

1:25:24.516 --> 1:25:26.186
YOU FRIGGIN' JAMIE!

1:25:55.349 --> 1:25:57.514
JAMIE: Krista,
call my name.

1:26:00.849 --> 1:26:03.553
If you call
my name just...

1:26:04.820 --> 1:26:06.688
just once,
you just...

1:26:08.461 --> 1:26:10.230
just say, Jamie.

1:26:12.729 --> 1:26:14.696
I'll come out
of the water and...

1:26:17.338 --> 1:26:19.206
and you'll dance in
your wedding dress and...

1:26:23.069 --> 1:26:24.574
and maybe...

1:26:27.348 --> 1:26:30.173
maybe I can...

1:26:32.683 --> 1:26:35.387
All's you gotta say
is, Jamie.

1:26:38.359 --> 1:26:40.051
You just...

1:26:41.087 --> 1:26:43.494
say...

1:26:50.635 --> 1:26:52.569
KRISTA: I swear to God.

1:26:54.540 --> 1:26:55.539
I swear to God I...

1:26:57.136 --> 1:26:58.410
I swear to God!

1:26:59.512 --> 1:27:01.215
Oh my God,
I swear to God.

1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:04.042
Jamie.

1:27:04.077 --> 1:27:05.582
I told you not to!

1:27:07.322 --> 1:27:09.047
I TOLD YOU. YOU...

1:27:10.182 --> 1:27:12.391
Shit!

1:27:12.426 --> 1:27:14.118
I HATE YOU!

1:27:15.627 --> 1:27:18.155
YOU FUCKING FUCKER!

1:27:20.335 --> 1:27:23.028
KRISTA: Please.

1:27:24.196 --> 1:27:25.767
Please.

1:27:34.514 --> 1:27:36.514
Jamie.
