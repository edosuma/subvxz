WEBVTT

00:06.160 --> 00:10.930
He did not slip and fall down three
flights of stairs by accident.

00:10.980 --> 00:14.020
And you were the only person who
knew he was there, Mr Huntley.

00:15.900 --> 00:19.210
You're linked to the near-death
of an anti-corruption detective.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.820
And You were hanging around
outside a crime scene.

00:22.900 --> 00:26.010
Is there any chance that
this could be Nick Huntley?

00:26.060 --> 00:29.410
I'm not sure if he's the
one attacked me or...

00:29.460 --> 00:31.690
maybe I'm remembering an old case.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.340
I'm sorry, sir.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.090
What have you got against Michael Farmer,

00:37.140 --> 00:39.640
except him being retarded
enough for you to frame?!

00:41.000 --> 00:45.540
That sample, KRG-13, was tampered with.

00:49.260 --> 00:50.930
He was one of our own.

00:50.980 --> 00:53.450
I'm going to get on with finding
the bastard who did this.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.090
Hana Reznikova was the last
person known to have had contact

00:56.140 --> 00:57.490
with the victim.

00:57.540 --> 01:00.170
Hana Reznikova, I am arresting
you in connection with the murder

01:00.220 --> 01:01.540
of Timothy Ifield.

01:05.980 --> 01:07.410
You cut yourself?

01:07.460 --> 01:10.130
It's fine. I just caught
it on some brickwork.

01:10.180 --> 01:12.130
We're going to take a swab.

01:12.180 --> 01:14.010
Is that necessary?

01:14.060 --> 01:15.980
You should see a specialist.

01:19.220 --> 01:22.690
I have the authority to charge
you with the following offences.

01:22.740 --> 01:24.890
Namely for the murder of Baswinder Kaur,

01:24.940 --> 01:26.570
the murder of Leonie Collisdale,

01:26.620 --> 01:30.010
the kidnapping and attempted
murder of Hana Reznikova.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.970
Michael, the charges against you
are going to be hard to fight.

01:33.020 --> 01:35.650
Or we can consider the best
way to reduce the overall time

01:35.700 --> 01:37.460
you end up serving in prison.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.890
Come on, he'd change his story
if he thought it'd help.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.050
You're claiming the FI says

01:43.100 --> 01:45.570
whatever the investigating
police officer wants to hear?

01:45.620 --> 01:47.050
You're putting words in my mouth.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.540
- Say that again, DC Desford.
- You're put...

01:51.860 --> 01:54.170
Is DS Flynn an undercover AC-12 officer?

01:55.380 --> 01:59.650
You see the pattern here?
Sexism, undercover operations,

01:59.700 --> 02:01.380
and questionable evidence.

02:03.180 --> 02:05.530
You should have seen his face.

02:05.580 --> 02:08.130
He had no idea where I was
getting the ammunition.

02:08.180 --> 02:11.570
This is a signed authority from
Assistant Chief Constable Hilton,

02:11.620 --> 02:14.450
recusing AC-12 from your inquiry into me,

02:14.500 --> 02:17.140
my team and the above offences.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.900 --> 02:32.730
- Ted.
- Sir.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.770
There's an institutional failure
to admit error here, sir.

02:35.820 --> 02:39.770
Actually, it's a wilful effort
to bury allegations of wrongdoing,

02:39.820 --> 02:42.210
and, to cap it all, the only
department that's trying to

02:42.260 --> 02:45.380
get to the truth, mine, is
the one that's been recused!

02:46.940 --> 02:49.650
You're right, Ted. There
has been a failure --

02:49.700 --> 02:52.370
to provide sufficient
evidence against Roz Huntley.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.250
Plus she's levelled credible accusations

02:54.300 --> 02:57.890
against your undercover officer of
entrapment, of coaching witnesses,

02:57.940 --> 03:00.130
possibly even of manipulating charges.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.370
My officers conduct themselves to the
letter of the law, sir, the letter!

03:03.420 --> 03:05.250
So you didn't have a
deeply corrupt officer

03:05.300 --> 03:07.660
embedded in your department for two years?

03:08.780 --> 03:10.570
No-one regrets more than me, sir,

03:10.620 --> 03:12.930
not seeing through Matthew
Cottan's deception.

03:12.980 --> 03:14.850
Cottan's dying declaration,

03:14.900 --> 03:17.340
I want the full recording
handed over to me.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.490
- Morning, Jan.
- Morning, sir.

03:20.540 --> 03:22.650
Sir, my department operates
under the protection

03:22.700 --> 03:25.170
of no reciprocity, as well you know.

03:25.220 --> 03:27.090
That part of the recording was released

03:27.140 --> 03:28.970
because it pertained to court proceedings.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.650
The rest was withheld, and
will continue to be withheld,

03:31.700 --> 03:34.410
in case it alerts those officers
who are subject to our ongoing

03:34.460 --> 03:36.090
lines of inquiry.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.730
You've had a year to pursue the claims

03:37.780 --> 03:41.850
made in Cottan's dying declaration.
Where are all the suspects, hmm?

03:41.900 --> 03:45.250
This alleged clandestine network
of corrupt police officers

03:45.300 --> 03:47.490
in league with organised crime?

03:47.540 --> 03:49.970
Arrests? None. Charges? None.

03:50.020 --> 03:53.530
Yes, well it's not without the want
of trying, sir, believe you me!

03:53.580 --> 03:55.530
It's clear to me, sir,
that there are officers,

03:55.580 --> 03:59.450
and possibly some senior officers,
still active, who were aware

03:59.500 --> 04:03.410
of and/or complicit with
Matthew Cottan's offences,

04:03.460 --> 04:08.010
who were aware of and/or complicit
with an institutional cover-up.

04:08.060 --> 04:11.250
AC-12 is being met with
a conspiracy of silence.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.370
We're not in on it,
we're trying to break it!

04:13.420 --> 04:15.610
Failing to break it.

04:15.660 --> 04:18.250
Roz Huntley's proved you're
an ineffectual organisation.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.529
- A corrupt organisation.
- Sir, I must protest!

04:20.579 --> 04:22.410
Do you know, Ted, my guess is that

04:22.460 --> 04:24.610
we don't know the half of
Matthew Cottan's activities

04:24.660 --> 04:27.410
and the real reason you're
keeping that full recording secret

04:27.460 --> 04:30.010
is because of the ammunition
it'll give AC-12's critics.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.010
Untrue, categorically untrue!

04:32.060 --> 04:34.210
Now, you can't say I didn't
give you a chance, Ted.

04:34.260 --> 04:36.930
I'll be reporting to the
DCC and the Chief Constable

04:36.980 --> 04:39.970
that AC-12 is more damaging
to the Police Service

04:40.020 --> 04:42.700
than the officers you're
meant to be investigating.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.090
Just hold your back straight.

04:51.140 --> 04:53.210
OK.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.980
Keep your head up.

04:56.900 --> 04:57.610
Good.

05:00.060 --> 05:03.140
You're doing great.
Take it nice and slowly.

05:04.620 --> 05:09.370
That's it. Keep the back
straight. Keep it going.

05:09.420 --> 05:11.250
I'm all right.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.690
Your injuries were extremely serious.

05:13.740 --> 05:16.170
The X-rays showed that
we've done a good job

05:16.220 --> 05:17.690
with your legs and pelvis,

05:17.740 --> 05:20.770
but your MRI showed that there's
still significant swelling

05:20.820 --> 05:22.980
at the site of your vertebral fracture.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.660
I'll be walking, though?

05:29.740 --> 05:31.930
At this stage it's not
possible to rule out

05:31.980 --> 05:35.250
long-term mobility problems.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.620
I wish we could be more positive.

05:38.780 --> 05:40.700
Thank you.

05:43.180 --> 05:45.690
DS Arnott's attacker.

05:45.740 --> 05:49.410
The thing is, boss, the lab's put
the images through the software

05:49.460 --> 05:53.490
and there's a decent chance Arnott's
attacker is the same person captured

05:53.540 --> 05:54.970
in the original sighting,

05:55.020 --> 05:57.330
the night of Leonie
Collisdale's disappearance.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.420
Thanks, Neil.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.850
Well, it's possible. Of course it is.

06:04.900 --> 06:07.820
But it calls into question
Michael Farmer's guilt.

06:09.140 --> 06:11.810
And what we're hearing is
that Farmer's on the verge

06:11.860 --> 06:14.410
of changing his plea to guilty.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.610
And regarding Timothy Ifield's murder,

06:16.660 --> 06:20.450
still the only person we can
actually place at Tim's murder

06:20.500 --> 06:22.220
is Hana Reznikova.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.340
Thank you, everyone.

06:34.140 --> 06:37.090
Sarge?

06:37.140 --> 06:41.130
The boss is so keen to
pin Tim's murder on Hana,

06:41.180 --> 06:43.650
whilst Balaclava Man's still out there.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.730
You know AC-12 interviewed her
husband over Arnott's fall.

06:46.780 --> 06:49.930
And who's seen in the vicinity?

06:49.980 --> 06:51.300
Balaclava Man.

07:02.460 --> 07:05.420
- Sir.
- Remain at attention.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.130
DS Fleming here, someone blew her cover.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.690
Thanks to whoever that was,

07:11.740 --> 07:14.290
Huntley's entrapped me into
discrediting the investigation.

07:14.340 --> 07:15.810
Yeah. Now I told you, fella,

07:15.860 --> 07:18.340
if ever there was a leak,
we'd know it was you.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.890
Do you have any evidence?

07:21.940 --> 07:23.540
You've got a bloody nerve.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.370
See, undercover officers have a life span.

07:27.420 --> 07:30.250
There comes a time when they've
been deployed once too often,

07:30.300 --> 07:32.410
they get recognised, or
they lose their touch.

07:32.460 --> 07:35.130
She knew stuff about my personal
life. She got that from someone.

07:35.180 --> 07:37.890
How the hell would I know
anything about your personal life?

07:37.940 --> 07:39.970
Wasn't me, sir.

07:40.020 --> 07:43.420
Get out! Get out of my sight! Go on!

07:46.860 --> 07:49.370
You lot treat everyone like mugs.

07:49.420 --> 07:52.180
- Who's the mug now?
- Get out!

07:58.180 --> 08:00.290
It's worse than I thought, sir.

08:00.340 --> 08:01.890
How?

08:01.940 --> 08:04.100
They're not scared of us any more.

08:06.140 --> 08:08.290
Not only that, Buckells is right.

08:08.340 --> 08:11.010
Fat chance he knew anything
about my personal life.

08:11.060 --> 08:14.380
What? Somebody in here?

08:17.180 --> 08:19.620
No. Never.

08:24.580 --> 08:27.140
Polk Avenue, Major Violent
Crime Unit, PC Jatri.

08:30.860 --> 08:33.220
Could you hold the line please?

08:43.820 --> 08:47.060
- What is it?
- A woman's remains have been found.

08:52.380 --> 08:55.010
DCI Huntley.

08:55.060 --> 08:58.250
- Hi, Roz.
- So what have we got so far?

08:58.300 --> 09:00.650
Body parts wrapped in plastic bin-liners.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.770
We're only a quarter of a mile
away from where the body parts

09:03.820 --> 09:06.490
of Leonie Collisdale were found.

09:06.540 --> 09:09.090
So this must be the rest of her, right?

09:09.140 --> 09:12.370
Except these remains are nowhere
near as decomposed as Leonie's.

09:12.420 --> 09:15.010
The wrapping in bin-liners
is also a contrasting feature.

09:15.060 --> 09:17.140
Most likely this is someone else.

09:18.980 --> 09:22.130
So far we appear to have a
leg split in two sections,

09:22.180 --> 09:24.290
an arm similarly disarticulated,

09:24.340 --> 09:26.970
possibly more to come
as we extend the dig.

09:27.020 --> 09:29.850
First priority is to get an ID.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.180
Sure.

09:33.540 --> 09:36.180
Less decomposition, more recent.

09:37.540 --> 09:40.450
And how long's Michael
Farmer been in custody?

09:46.420 --> 09:49.890
Sir. Someone to see you, in your
office with Kate, if that's OK?

09:49.940 --> 09:51.690
Yeah. Who?

09:51.740 --> 09:54.540
- He wanted to introduce himself, sir.
- Oh, right.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.810
Steve!

10:00.860 --> 10:03.770
I hope you'll forgive me
if I don't get up, sir.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.410
It's great to see you, but, you know,

10:05.460 --> 10:07.610
you really shouldn't have
put yourself out like this.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.330
This isn't a social call, sir.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.170
I'm returning to work.

10:11.220 --> 10:13.050
I've tried to tell him it's too soon, sir.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.290
Look, I've had an assessment
with occupational health

10:15.340 --> 10:18.090
and they've given me the all-clear
to return to restricted duties.

10:18.140 --> 10:19.650
This is just a precaution, sir.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.610
The doctors have said
I'll make a full recovery.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.410
Great.

10:23.460 --> 10:26.010
Well, I can't say that
I'm not glad to see you.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.330
There's been a few developments
since you've been away.

10:28.380 --> 10:30.090
Yeah. I've brought him up to speed, sir.

10:30.140 --> 10:32.530
Roz Huntley can't be allowed
to mislead the investigation.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.050
And ACC Hilton never said
anything about not investigating

10:35.100 --> 10:38.010
Tim Ifield's murder or Nick
Huntley's movements that night.

10:38.060 --> 10:40.650
If Nick Huntley's involved,
we'll be the ones to catch him.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.770
And if he's involved, you
can bet Roz Huntley is too.

10:43.820 --> 10:46.450
Well, what are yous waiting
on then, the number 19 bus?

10:46.500 --> 10:47.540
Sir.

10:59.580 --> 11:00.890
Take your time, Nick.

11:00.940 --> 11:01.980
The 25th.

11:04.180 --> 11:08.530
Yes, I was at a work function
in Northampton that evening.

11:08.580 --> 11:09.890
Yes.

11:09.940 --> 11:12.970
And I bet there are loads of
witnesses to corroborate that?

11:13.020 --> 11:15.650
- Yes. - Great, thanks.
I hope that's covered.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.970
Anything else?

11:17.020 --> 11:20.130
Do you have any of your
officer's DNA on my client?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.010
You all right? Do you
want a tea or coffee?

11:22.060 --> 11:24.330
No, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.010
All right, well, if you need anything,

11:26.060 --> 11:28.890
just call me on the mobile,
save you having to... you know.

11:28.940 --> 11:30.490
Kate. Nick Huntley's alibi --

11:30.540 --> 11:32.290
has someone actually checked that out?

11:32.340 --> 11:36.370
No, while you was away we stopped
being capable of basic police work.

11:36.420 --> 11:37.850
Sorry.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.730
Actually, with all the
files being recalled,

11:39.780 --> 11:42.330
it could've fallen through
the cracks. I'll double check.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.620
Cheers, appreciate it.

11:45.340 --> 11:48.010
There's no evidence he's
the man who attacked you.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.100
I know.

11:50.780 --> 11:51.820
OK.

11:56.220 --> 11:58.930
Nick Huntley claimed, via his
solicitor, that he attended

11:58.980 --> 12:01.610
the legal conference's
closing drinks reception

12:01.660 --> 12:03.730
and didn't leave till around 8pm.

12:03.780 --> 12:06.610
However, no records were kept of
attendance at the drinks function,

12:06.660 --> 12:08.930
so there's no independent corroboration

12:08.980 --> 12:11.340
of Nick Huntley's
whereabouts at that time.

12:13.020 --> 12:19.570
But ANPR detected the car registered
to Nick Huntley on the M6 at 18.15.

12:19.620 --> 12:21.090
He's been lying.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.290
And the motorways were clear that evening.

12:23.340 --> 12:26.090
He had plenty of time to
carry out the offence.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.530
Great.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.490
- Great, cheers, Maneet.
- That's great. Thanks, Maneet.

12:30.540 --> 12:31.850
Great work.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.050
So he was under pressure to come
up with an alibi and he took a risk.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.370
All we've actually got though is
he's been caught out in a lie.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.900
Cheers, Jamie, we've got this.

12:51.420 --> 12:54.130
That wasn't his fault the Roz
Huntley interview went pear-shaped.

12:54.180 --> 12:56.290
The gaffer brought him
in while I was undercover.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.460
I'm back now, and so are you.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.930
I need to get ready for work.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.890
Have you been to the doctor?

13:31.940 --> 13:33.820
Yes, and I'm fine.

13:36.140 --> 13:39.090
It's starting to stink, you
know, that thing on your wrist.

13:39.140 --> 13:40.740
That thing is just a graze...

13:41.820 --> 13:42.940
.. and it's fine.

13:55.540 --> 13:58.450
Jamie, sorry, just had a message from IT.

13:58.500 --> 14:01.180
We need to reset usernames
and passwords, again.

14:02.420 --> 14:03.460
Yeah, sure.

15:02.660 --> 15:04.610
The FC's on her way down.

15:04.660 --> 15:07.580
Looks like she's got the first
results on the new remains.

15:09.300 --> 15:11.420
Good. Just give me a minute.

15:12.900 --> 15:13.940
All right, boss.

15:19.060 --> 15:20.660
Everyone in the incident room.

15:50.980 --> 15:54.130
- Go ahead, Rupal.
- Thank you, DCI Huntley.

15:54.180 --> 15:57.250
Forensic report regarding
human remains detected on the

15:57.300 --> 16:00.330
Queen's Chase woodland
on the 23rd of April.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.880
Remains have been examined
by the pathologist...

16:15.620 --> 16:18.380
And matched control samples relating to...

16:20.380 --> 16:21.780
.. Leonie Collersdale.

16:24.260 --> 16:25.980
- It's Leonie?
- Yeah.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.300
Well, that's great news. Thank you.

16:37.140 --> 16:38.530
This is not a new victim.

16:38.580 --> 16:42.140
So another family doesn't have
to deal with a terrible tragedy.

16:43.340 --> 16:46.020
And also, we do not need
to consider another suspect.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.380
OK. Thanks.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.970
Sorry, boss. Rupal, question.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.930
At the crime scene, you said
the degree of decomposition

16:54.980 --> 16:57.450
was different from the rest
of Leonie's body parts?

16:57.500 --> 16:59.170
DS Twyler's correct.

16:59.220 --> 17:03.170
The pathologist found evidence
of deep-freezing of the remains.

17:03.220 --> 17:06.210
The body parts must've been kept
in cold storage before being buried.

17:06.260 --> 17:07.890
And weren't there other differences?

17:07.940 --> 17:10.970
Yes, the remains were wrapped
in paper and then sealed inside

17:11.020 --> 17:12.530
of plastic bin liners.

17:12.579 --> 17:16.569
We've taken samples, and studies are
ongoing to see if these materials

17:16.619 --> 17:19.940
can provide any leads on who
might have handled them or where.

17:21.579 --> 17:24.220
- OK. Thank you.
- Thanks, everyone.

17:38.580 --> 17:41.210
Michael Farmer's legal team have
made an application to change

17:41.260 --> 17:43.860
- his plea to guilty.
- For Christ's sake.

17:45.540 --> 17:48.170
From his viewpoint, the
evidence just keeps stacking up.

17:48.220 --> 17:50.810
I know, I know. His solicitor must
have told him to cut his losses

17:50.860 --> 17:52.090
and go for a reduced sentence.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.370
But one of you have got
to visit that prison

17:54.420 --> 17:56.770
and tell Michael Farmer that
we are fighting his corner.

17:56.820 --> 17:59.050
Sir, sorry, after
everything that's happened,

17:59.100 --> 18:01.370
why would Farmer trust a
word either of us say?

18:01.420 --> 18:03.620
The word of any police officer.

18:17.940 --> 18:20.100
We're just waiting on your solicitor.

18:23.620 --> 18:26.370
You know, Michael, there
are other solicitors,

18:26.420 --> 18:27.700
better ones.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.660
The first time, about Jade...

18:34.380 --> 18:35.420
.. I liked him.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.260
Your solicitor for your first conviction?

18:40.500 --> 18:41.540
OK.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.410
He might not be the best person,
but I can check him out for you,

18:45.460 --> 18:46.700
if you'd like to see him?

18:49.940 --> 18:51.460
Sorry, sorry.

19:05.220 --> 19:07.700
Michael, I've arranged
for you to have a visitor.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.010
Nana.

19:15.060 --> 19:17.410
Hello, Michael. It's lovely to see you.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.620
I've missed you, Nana.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.860
Michael, I'll see you after.

19:30.980 --> 19:32.380
I'll leave you all to catch up.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.500
How are you managing, Michael?

19:41.100 --> 19:43.050
It's horrible in here, Nana.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.620
I've always cared for you.

19:46.940 --> 19:48.700
That won't change, no matter what.

19:50.220 --> 19:51.520
You can tell me the truth.

19:52.540 --> 19:55.460
You can tell me, and I
won't stop loving you.

19:57.380 --> 19:58.420
I know.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.730
Did you do it, Michael?

20:01.780 --> 20:02.820
Did you?

20:03.820 --> 20:05.730
No, Nana.

20:05.780 --> 20:06.970
No.

20:07.020 --> 20:08.540
Then tell the truth, Michael.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.540
Don't say you're guilty if you're not.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.260
OK, Nana.

20:18.860 --> 20:19.900
Say it, Michael.

20:22.740 --> 20:23.940
Not guilty, Nana.

20:25.940 --> 20:26.980
Not guilty.

20:31.420 --> 20:32.460
PC Jatri.

20:34.140 --> 20:37.490
'Roz, this is Dr Patel from
Starbrook Road Surgery.

20:37.540 --> 20:40.850
'I need you to call me back
urgently regarding the swab I took

20:40.900 --> 20:42.260
'from the wound on your arm.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.930
'Please go straight to your
nearest A&E immediately.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.770
I'm sorry to interrupt, ma'am. The
application from Michael Farmer

20:50.820 --> 20:52.970
- hasn't gone to the court.
- What's the delay?

20:53.020 --> 20:56.060
They're saying he's not planning
to change to a guilty plea.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.690
OK. Thanks, Farida.

20:59.740 --> 21:01.100
Ma'am.

21:15.980 --> 21:18.570
Framing Michael Farmer
couldn't have been random.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.890
It's no coincidence Michael had
been on the sex offenders' register.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.730
A loner with no-one to provide an alibi,

21:23.780 --> 21:25.210
who follows a predictable routine --

21:25.260 --> 21:26.810
out every night to visit his grandma,

21:26.860 --> 21:28.290
then clocks in on the night shift.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.250
Yeah, but we went through
the records way back.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.170
Roz Huntley never had anything to
do with Michael's prior conviction,

21:33.220 --> 21:34.970
she never even worked with anyone who did.

21:35.020 --> 21:37.180
So how could she have picked Michael?

21:38.220 --> 21:40.090
You know what they're
going to say, don't you?

21:40.140 --> 21:42.170
Because we couldn't pin
your fall on Nick Huntley,

21:42.220 --> 21:45.450
we're going after the pair
of them for something else.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.820
Yeah.

21:55.820 --> 21:57.460
- Thanks, mate.
- It's all right.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.780
- Getting good at this.
- Cheers.

22:06.740 --> 22:09.730
- I'll come up. - No, you're all
right. My building's got a lift.

22:09.780 --> 22:11.050
You sure?

22:11.100 --> 22:12.970
Yeah. I'm fine. Night, Kate.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.460
Night, Steve.

22:32.460 --> 22:35.210
Sarge, you asked me to track
down Michael Farmer's solicitor

22:35.260 --> 22:37.130
from his conviction when he was 16?

22:37.180 --> 22:39.410
Yeah, for whatever reason,
Michael seemed to like him.

22:39.460 --> 22:41.100
You'll never guess who it was.

22:46.140 --> 22:47.180
Kate.

22:49.780 --> 22:52.860
What did I say about there being
no such thing as coincidence?

22:56.820 --> 22:59.610
Mr Lakewell, you're Nick Huntley's
solicitor, is that correct?

22:59.660 --> 23:04.090
No. I just provided him with a
bit of legal advice, as a favour.

23:04.140 --> 23:07.410
How would you describe your
relationship with Nick Huntley?

23:07.460 --> 23:10.770
We were at law school together. Old mates.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.330
You socialised?

23:12.380 --> 23:13.410
Yes.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.050
Your wives socialise with you?

23:15.100 --> 23:18.020
I'm divorced, but, yes, we mix socially.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.090
What's behind this line of inquiry?

23:21.140 --> 23:22.940
Do you know the name Jade Hopkirk?

23:24.460 --> 23:26.220
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

23:27.940 --> 23:32.330
"Mr Lakewell denies knowing Jade Hopkirk."

23:32.380 --> 23:35.490
"Detective attempts rudimentary
interview technique on

23:35.540 --> 23:37.610
"seasoned criminal solicitor.

23:37.660 --> 23:39.300
"Makes a bit of a tit of herself."

23:42.020 --> 23:45.650
We're looking into who knew about
Michael Farmer's past, who might

23:45.700 --> 23:49.570
have considered him a likely suspect
for offences against young women.

23:49.620 --> 23:51.090
Jade Hopkirk was the alleged victim

23:51.140 --> 23:53.740
when Michael Farmer was
convicted of rape in 2009.

23:55.580 --> 23:58.690
Yes, of course, now I
recall exactly who you mean.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.970
I represented Michael.

24:01.020 --> 24:03.170
He pleaded guilty.

24:03.220 --> 24:06.370
He had sex with a 15-year-old
girl, without her consent.

24:06.420 --> 24:09.690
That's rape. He pleaded
guilty because he was guilty.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.970
Was it your idea not to
test that out on a jury?

24:13.020 --> 24:15.850
What went on between myself
and my client is privileged.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.050
So you never discussed the
case with Nick Huntley?

24:18.100 --> 24:19.220
Or Roz Huntley?

24:20.540 --> 24:22.290
Exactly.

24:22.340 --> 24:25.530
As you'll recall, sir, at
his interview with AC-12,

24:25.580 --> 24:28.330
Mr Huntley declined to answer
questions regarding his whereabouts

24:28.380 --> 24:31.010
for parts of the evening
of the 18th of March --

24:31.060 --> 24:33.220
the night of Timothy Ifield's murder.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.850
Can you vouch for his whereabouts?

24:36.900 --> 24:38.530
Listen, Ironside,

24:38.580 --> 24:42.100
you've got no evidence against
Nick, so I don't have to.

24:44.820 --> 24:46.540
Fine. Come on, Steve.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.730
Jimmy?

25:26.780 --> 25:29.090
I've just had AC-12 turn up
at my office, asking questions

25:29.140 --> 25:32.540
about Nick's whereabouts on the
night of Timothy Ifield's murder.

25:33.820 --> 25:35.330
What did you tell them?

25:35.380 --> 25:38.290
Nothing, obviously. I thought
you and Nick should know.

25:38.340 --> 25:41.650
Good. Thank you, Jimmy,
and no need to tell Nick.

25:41.700 --> 25:42.930
I'll let him know.

25:42.980 --> 25:44.740
I've already sent him a voicemail.

25:46.020 --> 25:47.570
Should I not have?

25:47.620 --> 25:49.250
No, that's fine.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.020
Thanks. Thanks again, Jimmy.

26:17.220 --> 26:18.970
You've reached the personal voicemail of

26:19.020 --> 26:21.140
Assistant Chief Constable Derek Hilton.

26:22.500 --> 26:26.530
You said AC-12 were finished. You
said their witch-hunt was finished,

26:26.580 --> 26:28.490
but they're still after me.

26:28.540 --> 26:32.060
My husband, his solicitor, any
backdoor route they can find.

26:33.260 --> 26:35.700
You don't know what this
is doing to my marriage.

26:52.980 --> 26:54.020
Well done.

26:55.420 --> 26:56.460
I'm finished.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.170
I feel drained, sir.

27:03.220 --> 27:06.490
It's not long till the start
of my maternity leave.

27:06.540 --> 27:08.330
I see.

27:08.380 --> 27:10.580
Things are beginning to get on top of me.

27:11.860 --> 27:13.490
And the timing couldn't be worse.

27:13.540 --> 27:15.530
I really need all my
best people, you know.

27:15.580 --> 27:18.740
The last thing I want to do is
let you and the department down.

27:19.980 --> 27:21.170
I see.

27:21.220 --> 27:24.250
Well, if your mind's made up.

27:24.300 --> 27:26.210
I wish you all the best, darling.

27:26.260 --> 27:27.660
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

27:30.020 --> 27:33.330
I'd appreciate if you don't
say too much to the team.

27:33.380 --> 27:35.100
I don't want anyone making a fuss.

27:58.900 --> 28:01.450
Listen, thanks for meeting
me outside the office.

28:01.500 --> 28:02.770
Yeah, any time, mate.

28:02.820 --> 28:05.690
Oh, and thank you for the
voicemail last night.

28:05.740 --> 28:07.810
I don't know where AC-12
are going with this,

28:07.860 --> 28:09.890
but I had to let you and Roz know.

28:09.940 --> 28:13.610
Did you get chance to
talk it through last night?

28:13.660 --> 28:14.980
Actually, no.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.100
Oh?

28:18.580 --> 28:21.970
No, this is why I wanted to
meet you outside the office.

28:22.020 --> 28:23.420
Me and Roz...

28:25.980 --> 28:27.740
.. it's a bit messed up right now.

28:28.980 --> 28:30.300
It's a lot messed up.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.610
I've been there, the divorce.

28:35.660 --> 28:37.810
Sorry to hear that, mate.

28:37.860 --> 28:39.020
It's more than that.

28:46.540 --> 28:50.890
Roz has been lying to me about where
she was when Tim Ifield was killed.

28:50.940 --> 28:55.140
She has this wound on her
arm from the same night.

28:58.340 --> 29:03.180
I've got tangible concerns that
she's involved in a serious crime.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.530
My God.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.260
I'm at my wits' end, mate.

29:11.740 --> 29:13.250
God, of course.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.860
Really sorry.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.420
If you want me to, I can sort it.

29:18.700 --> 29:22.090
Voluntary interview, anonymity,
independent police station...

29:22.140 --> 29:24.010
immunity.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.260
If -- big if -- you want me to.

29:27.500 --> 29:28.930
That was the solicitor talking.

29:28.980 --> 29:31.170
As your friend, I'd warn you
that even if your concerns

29:31.220 --> 29:32.660
turn out to be baseless...

29:33.700 --> 29:36.050
.. this could mean the
end of your marriage,

29:36.100 --> 29:37.300
the end of your family.

29:38.780 --> 29:40.140
No happy ending.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.450
Come in.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.540
Ah, Kate.

29:56.540 --> 29:58.930
Sir, this is an IT report.

29:58.980 --> 30:01.810
I asked them to detail any searches
or downloads of any sensitive

30:01.860 --> 30:04.930
case material carried out
by AC-12 staff in relation

30:04.980 --> 30:07.980
to undercover operations,
in the last two weeks.

30:09.220 --> 30:11.610
If you go to the entry on page six, sir,

30:11.660 --> 30:12.980
I found this instead.

30:24.700 --> 30:25.980
I'm very sorry, sir.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.650
No, no, no, no, you did the
right thing, absolutely.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.340
- Thank you, Kate. - Sir. - Thank you.

30:41.420 --> 30:42.580
DC Desford.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.340
- Sir?
- Yeah, come in. Shut the door.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.060
Sir.

31:03.580 --> 31:06.370
Now, tell me, for what
reason have you been...

31:06.420 --> 31:09.810
accessing highly sensitive AC-12 files,

31:09.860 --> 31:13.660
namely DI Matthew
Cottan's dying declaration?

31:14.900 --> 31:16.740
- I haven't, sir.
- No?

31:24.300 --> 31:26.130
No, sir. This wasn't me, sir.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.730
For years, the security in this department

31:28.780 --> 31:30.370
has been watertight, fella.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.290
Absolutely watertight.

31:32.340 --> 31:36.170
Then you come along, suddenly
we're leaking like a colander.

31:36.220 --> 31:38.170
I know what this is about.

31:38.220 --> 31:41.300
First I'm scapegoated over the
Huntley interview, now this.

31:42.740 --> 31:46.050
I could fight this, but I don't
want to be somewhere I'm not wanted.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.580
So I'll take a transfer, sir.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.970
It's definitely the
smartest move right now.

31:51.020 --> 31:52.730
And I hope you'll approve my request, sir,

31:52.780 --> 31:54.620
so I won't need to lodge a complaint.

31:55.900 --> 31:57.650
Are you threatening me?

31:57.700 --> 31:59.970
No, I've been treated unfairly, sir.

32:00.020 --> 32:03.330
And just for the record, I had
absolutely nothing to do with

32:03.380 --> 32:04.540
any security breach.

32:33.140 --> 32:34.890
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

32:34.940 --> 32:36.540
No, I was miles away. Come on in.

32:39.580 --> 32:41.420
I thought you should see this first.

32:44.220 --> 32:47.210
The material wrapped round
the body parts was newspaper.

32:47.260 --> 32:49.730
- Mm-hm. - Some fragments
survived sufficiently

32:49.780 --> 32:51.770
for the print to be legible.

32:51.820 --> 32:54.090
We were able to run
sections of text through

32:54.140 --> 32:58.490
a search engine to find
matches with online editions.

32:58.540 --> 33:01.690
All were nationals, so there's
no localising information.

33:01.740 --> 33:04.620
However, the dates are significant.

33:05.740 --> 33:08.770
Some text related to news
reports that only went to press

33:08.820 --> 33:10.260
at the end of March.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.330
As you know, Michael Farmer
was remanded in custody

33:14.380 --> 33:16.380
and Tim Ifield was already dead.

33:18.340 --> 33:19.890
Right.

33:19.940 --> 33:22.850
Shall we go through all
this in a team briefing?

33:22.900 --> 33:24.770
We've got something else on just now.

33:24.820 --> 33:26.610
Will you leave it with me?

33:26.660 --> 33:28.020
Sure, no problem.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.370
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

33:37.420 --> 33:38.460
Right.

34:13.699 --> 34:15.650
Roz?

34:16.199 --> 34:17.020
You OK?

34:18.580 --> 34:19.659
Nick?

34:24.460 --> 34:25.699
Lying on a beach?

34:27.540 --> 34:28.820
Lying on a beach...

34:33.780 --> 34:34.980
Lying bitch.

35:00.660 --> 35:03.490
Hi, Rupal. Anything I help you with?

35:03.540 --> 35:06.330
- Roz not in?
- Not seen her yet.

35:06.380 --> 35:07.890
Well, I'm only around this morning.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.090
I didn't want to miss the team briefing.

35:10.140 --> 35:11.730
What team briefing?

35:11.780 --> 35:13.300
About the new findings.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.810
Leonie Collersdale's
remains having been disposed

35:16.860 --> 35:19.060
of after Michael Farmer was remanded.

35:23.900 --> 35:24.940
I see.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.090
Neil?

36:10.140 --> 36:13.180
I've got one thing to say,
and we don't ever meet again.

36:14.940 --> 36:15.980
And no-one...

36:17.500 --> 36:19.460
.. no-one ever hears my name.

36:29.580 --> 36:31.650
Sorry to call you back in so late, sir.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.340
I've got a source at Polk Avenue.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.010
Now we're sucking diesel. Go on.

36:36.060 --> 36:39.290
OK, so, he, or she, insists on anonymity.

36:39.340 --> 36:42.050
They won't go on record and they
won't cooperate with any inquiry.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.650
But what they did say is they've
received new forensic evidence

36:44.700 --> 36:47.730
showing Leonie's remains were buried
after Michael Farmer was arrested.

36:47.780 --> 36:50.900
There's no way Hilton can
still back Huntley after this.

36:52.100 --> 36:53.810
Yeah, and erm...

36:53.860 --> 36:56.730
Yes, what else do we know about
these new forensics, Kate?

36:56.780 --> 36:59.170
Well, it appears they've
been held in cold storage,

36:59.220 --> 37:01.690
probably a deep freeze, for
some time before being buried.

37:01.740 --> 37:04.410
But this new evidence gives us a
clear reason to reopen the inquiry

37:04.460 --> 37:08.650
into Huntley and get the charges
against Michael Farmer dropped.

37:08.700 --> 37:10.210
Steve?

37:10.260 --> 37:11.810
Steve, are you OK?

37:11.860 --> 37:13.500
Body parts held in cold storage.

37:16.380 --> 37:19.570
Jackie Laverty, a property developer
with ties to organised crime,

37:19.620 --> 37:20.930
last seen 2012.

37:20.980 --> 37:23.530
Yeah, the piece of work that
Tony Gates was hanging out with.

37:23.580 --> 37:26.090
According to Gates, Jackie's
body was kept in cold storage,

37:26.140 --> 37:27.810
with incriminating DNA.

37:27.860 --> 37:30.250
A means of blackmailing an
officer into manipulating

37:30.300 --> 37:31.730
criminal investigations.

37:31.780 --> 37:34.250
Exactly what's been done with
Leonie Collersdale's body.

37:34.300 --> 37:36.730
- What, you think they're connected?
- Well, there's more, sir.

37:36.780 --> 37:39.090
The man who attacked me,
he was wearing a balaclava

37:39.140 --> 37:41.170
and he struck me over the
head with a baseball bat.

37:41.220 --> 37:42.930
Now, I wasn't sure if
that was a real memory

37:42.980 --> 37:44.730
or I was confused with an old case.

37:44.780 --> 37:47.690
That old case was the men involved
with Jackie Laverty's murder.

37:47.740 --> 37:49.850
If you remember, I was
attacked by some of them.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.970
They wore balaclavas and
they used baseball bats.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.610
And Tony Gates, the only witness
to Jackie Laverty's murder,

37:54.660 --> 37:57.450
told me men wearing balaclavas
broke into Jackie's house

37:57.500 --> 37:59.370
and knocked him out
cold with a baseball bat.

37:59.420 --> 38:00.730
The MO's the same, sir.

38:00.780 --> 38:03.330
It raises the question as to
whether these organised criminals

38:03.380 --> 38:04.570
are involved in the murders,

38:04.620 --> 38:07.690
or are manipulating the
investigation somehow.

38:07.740 --> 38:09.890
Whether or not they're
protecting guilty parties...

38:09.940 --> 38:11.300
That's what we don't know.

38:15.900 --> 38:17.970
Anyway, thanks, Steve.

38:18.020 --> 38:20.050
And, Kate, you better get
home and get some kip.

38:20.100 --> 38:21.220
Look, wait, sir.

38:22.460 --> 38:26.570
Jackie's disappearance -- this was
our case and it remains unsolved.

38:26.620 --> 38:28.370
We've got every right to reopen it.

38:28.420 --> 38:30.770
And as they may be connected,
that might give us leeway to

38:30.820 --> 38:33.540
examine the forensics on
Leonie Collersdale's body.

38:35.900 --> 38:37.410
It's your call, sir.

38:37.460 --> 38:39.220
Hilton may use this to shut us down.

38:40.940 --> 38:41.980
He may.

38:44.180 --> 38:45.700
But if we go down...

38:47.380 --> 38:49.730
.. we go down fighting.

38:49.780 --> 38:50.980
Sir.

39:08.420 --> 39:09.540
What are you doing?

39:12.740 --> 39:15.100
Just making sure
everything's as it should be.

39:17.140 --> 39:18.340
Why am I here?

39:19.620 --> 39:22.290
Your husband wants to explain everything.

39:22.340 --> 39:24.540
I'll be back with an antibiotic injection.

39:28.220 --> 39:29.300
How are you feeling?

39:32.300 --> 39:33.340
What's going on?

39:35.220 --> 39:36.540
Roz, they had to operate.

39:38.060 --> 39:39.410
I just want to go home.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.730
- Hey, listen, listen, come on.
- I just want to go home!

39:41.780 --> 39:44.010
You're going to hurt yourself,
Roz. Just listen to me.

39:44.060 --> 39:45.620
The wound was very deep.

39:47.460 --> 39:50.810
The tissue was dead

39:50.860 --> 39:53.130
and the infection had gotten
into your bloodstream.

39:53.180 --> 39:55.020
They call it septic shock.

39:57.740 --> 39:59.940
If they didn't operate, you could've died.

40:02.420 --> 40:03.460
There was no choice.

40:13.620 --> 40:14.850
Oh, no!

40:14.900 --> 40:15.940
Shh, shh!

40:18.020 --> 40:19.730
Hey, hey, hey.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.570
- Shh.
- Why didn't you stop them?

40:21.620 --> 40:25.090
They had to operate,
to save your life, Roz.

40:25.140 --> 40:26.980
Why didn't you stop them?!

40:30.780 --> 40:32.620
She's still very woozy, poor thing.

40:34.020 --> 40:36.220
It's a lot to take in, no wonder.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.060
- Steve.
- Oh, cheers.

40:50.060 --> 40:51.770
(Jesus Christ.)

40:51.820 --> 40:53.490
Kate! Kate!

40:53.540 --> 40:56.930
Our independent forensic scientists
confirm the second set of body parts

40:56.980 --> 41:00.290
relating to Leonie Collersdale
shows cellular freeze-thaw damage

41:00.340 --> 41:03.450
similar to what we believe was
done to Jackie Laverty's body,

41:03.500 --> 41:06.490
and also that the newspaper found
wrapping the body parts has been

41:06.540 --> 41:10.770
dated to after Michael Farmer was
remanded and Tim Ifield was killed.

41:10.820 --> 41:13.170
Great. That's in the bag. Confirmation.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.530
But what's even more significant, sir,

41:15.580 --> 41:19.410
is he was also able to examine the
deposit of Timothy Ifield's blood

41:19.460 --> 41:22.890
supposedly detected on the first
set of Leonie Collersdale's remains.

41:22.940 --> 41:25.730
An item of evidence we've not
had direct access to before now.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.610
And?

41:27.660 --> 41:30.490
That blood deposit's contaminated
with the same high-density

41:30.540 --> 41:33.570
polythene fibres from a forensic
oversuit as the blood found

41:33.620 --> 41:36.450
at Tim Ifield's flat, despite
the samples being obtained weeks

41:36.500 --> 41:38.340
apart by different investigators.

41:40.020 --> 41:42.170
Mother of God. They've
both been falsified.

41:42.220 --> 41:44.810
In my view, sir, there's a very
real possibility Roz Huntley's

41:44.860 --> 41:47.900
been misleading the inquiry
to protect her husband.

41:51.060 --> 41:54.330
Right. Well, to hell with ACC
Hilton. This is our vindication.

41:54.380 --> 41:57.370
This puts us back in business.
Steve, you run things from here.

41:57.420 --> 41:58.930
Kate, take a couple of uniforms.

41:58.980 --> 42:01.770
- Get out and pick up Roz
and Nick Huntley. - Sir.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.450
Diane, get me a car out front immediately.

42:04.500 --> 42:07.290
Everyone, we need to find
Nick and Roz Huntley, now!

42:07.340 --> 42:08.380
Get on the phones.

42:13.100 --> 42:14.500
Get me Polk Avenue Station.

42:19.140 --> 42:21.410
- Steve? - Roz Huntley
hasn't reported for work.

42:21.460 --> 42:24.450
She was admitted to City
General two nights ago.

42:24.500 --> 42:25.530
What's wrong with her?

42:25.580 --> 42:27.730
They won't disclose the
reason for her admission,

42:27.780 --> 42:29.210
patient confidentiality.

42:29.260 --> 42:30.620
Received.

42:34.660 --> 42:36.020
City General Hospital.

42:47.940 --> 42:48.980
Mr Huntley.

42:51.340 --> 42:52.540
Where's my wife?

42:53.620 --> 42:56.460
She discharged herself,
against medical advice.

42:57.620 --> 42:59.930
- But why didn't you stop her?
- We did our best.

42:59.980 --> 43:02.410
We made sure she waited for
antibiotics and painkillers.

43:02.460 --> 43:04.130
You should have called me.

43:04.180 --> 43:07.340
Mrs Huntley was very clear
that you shouldn't be called.

43:14.620 --> 43:16.210
Keep the change. Thanks.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.490
You must be in a lot of pain.

43:18.540 --> 43:20.210
I won't lie.

43:20.260 --> 43:21.300
Come on.

43:31.420 --> 43:33.530
Let's just get you straight
home to bed, ma'am.

43:33.580 --> 43:35.300
No, just fill me in on everything.

43:37.060 --> 43:38.460
Tell me.

43:41.260 --> 43:43.490
This is strictly off the record, ma'am.

43:43.540 --> 43:46.130
I don't want to get anyone in any trouble.

43:46.180 --> 43:47.220
It's OK. Tell me.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.450
A solicitor has requested an
appointment for his anonymous client

43:51.500 --> 43:54.940
to give a voluntary interview to
an independent team of detectives.

43:55.940 --> 43:57.930
What about?

43:57.980 --> 43:59.780
The murder of Timothy Ifield.

44:01.860 --> 44:04.410
Apparently, the solicitor's
seeking immunity for whatever

44:04.460 --> 44:06.180
his client's going to disclose.

44:07.900 --> 44:09.180
Who's the solicitor?

44:11.660 --> 44:12.940
James Lakewell.

44:20.340 --> 44:21.490
Drive.

44:25.780 --> 44:27.770
- Fleming. - I managed to
get through to the ward.

44:27.820 --> 44:30.570
Huntley's discharged herself.
Nick Huntley came looking for her

44:30.620 --> 44:32.450
and left separately
just a few minutes ago.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.770
The nurse reckoned he was
going to their home address.

44:34.820 --> 44:37.660
Received. Right, turn round,
go, go, I'll direct you.

44:41.780 --> 44:42.820
Roz?

44:45.500 --> 44:46.540
Roz?

44:52.420 --> 44:54.460
- Hi, Nick.
- Roz, come on.

44:57.380 --> 44:59.810
Let's be sensible. Let's get
you back to hospital. Come on.

44:59.860 --> 45:02.330
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
- All right, OK.

45:02.380 --> 45:04.170
Where are the kids?

45:04.220 --> 45:05.260
They're fine.

45:07.100 --> 45:08.450
Where are the kids?

45:08.500 --> 45:10.610
It's being taken care of.

45:10.660 --> 45:11.900
Roz, you're worrying me.

45:14.580 --> 45:17.450
You don't have a right
to know where they are.

45:17.500 --> 45:18.860
We're getting a divorce.

45:21.260 --> 45:22.490
Look, Roz.

45:22.540 --> 45:25.500
OK, you're angry and you're
upset, and I get that.

45:28.060 --> 45:30.410
We're going to talk about this
when you're feeling better,

45:30.460 --> 45:32.770
but right now, I just need to
know that the kids are safe.

45:32.820 --> 45:34.650
Of course they're safe.

45:34.700 --> 45:36.540
They're walking round to Claire's.

45:38.140 --> 45:39.540
I'm just going to call them.

45:40.940 --> 45:43.740
Don't think that you stand a
chance of gaining custody?

45:45.340 --> 45:48.060
Amputating my hand without my consent.

45:49.460 --> 45:51.490
That's grievous bodily harm.

45:51.540 --> 45:53.410
Look, Roz, it wasn't me.

45:53.460 --> 45:55.490
It was the surgeons.

45:55.540 --> 45:57.690
You were going to lose
more than your hand.

45:57.740 --> 46:00.530
You were going to lose
your arm, or your life.

46:00.580 --> 46:02.610
You did this to me...

46:02.660 --> 46:04.490
because you'd thought I'd had an affair.

46:04.540 --> 46:06.140
No, you did this to yourself.

46:07.180 --> 46:09.410
All your lies.

46:09.460 --> 46:12.170
And it was you, outside the bathroom.

46:12.220 --> 46:14.900
You were the one calling me a lying bitch.

46:16.500 --> 46:19.570
And you think doing
this to me makes me less,

46:19.620 --> 46:22.090
means no man will ever look at me?

46:22.140 --> 46:24.890
Is this my punishment for
being a "lying bitch"?

46:24.940 --> 46:27.170
You've lied so much, Roz.

46:27.220 --> 46:29.220
I've lost track of the truth.

46:30.940 --> 46:36.450
You always said that you grazed
your hand on some brickwork.

46:36.500 --> 46:38.610
The infection they found was MRSA.

46:38.660 --> 46:40.660
That's why it was so serious.

46:41.660 --> 46:44.940
And it could never have happened
the way that you said that it did!

46:47.020 --> 46:52.170
I can just about live with you
covering up your infidelity.

46:52.220 --> 46:54.540
I can't live with you
covering up a murder.

46:56.780 --> 46:58.850
Is that what you're going
to say to the detectives

46:58.900 --> 47:00.500
at Fourth Street Station?

47:05.780 --> 47:07.940
How did...? How did you know about that?

47:08.940 --> 47:10.420
All this, to punish me.

47:11.900 --> 47:13.970
Well, now it's your turn.

47:14.020 --> 47:15.210
What?

47:15.260 --> 47:19.250
You lied about where you were when
Leonie Collersdale disappeared.

47:19.300 --> 47:21.570
You were at the building when
Steve Arnott was attacked.

47:21.620 --> 47:23.090
I explained all of that.

47:23.140 --> 47:26.090
And you were at the crime scene
the night Tim Ifield was murdered.

47:26.140 --> 47:28.090
Outside!

47:28.140 --> 47:30.570
The only male suspect to be
placed at the crime scene.

47:30.620 --> 47:32.650
No, no, wait. No!

47:32.700 --> 47:35.410
And you've lied about it to every
police officer you've spoken to.

47:35.460 --> 47:36.660
- To protect you!
- No.

47:37.780 --> 47:39.130
To protect yourself.

47:39.180 --> 47:40.610
What are you talking about?

47:40.660 --> 47:43.570
Nicholas Huntley, I'm arresting
you on suspicion of the murder

47:43.620 --> 47:45.050
of Timothy Ifield.

47:45.100 --> 47:47.450
- You do not have to say anything...
- This is insane!

47:47.500 --> 47:49.890
- You do not have to say anything.
- I'm going to get the kids.

47:49.940 --> 47:52.930
It may harm your defence if you
do not mention, when questioned,

47:52.980 --> 47:55.250
something you later rely on in court.

47:55.300 --> 47:58.410
Anything you do say may
be used in evidence.

47:58.460 --> 48:01.490
Mr Huntley, please don't make
this any harder than it is already.

48:01.540 --> 48:04.170
- Hands behind your back.
- She's lying! She's lying!

48:04.220 --> 48:06.610
Sir, please just calm down and
let us take you to the station.

48:06.660 --> 48:07.930
No! No!

48:07.980 --> 48:09.820
- No! - Right, cuff him. Calm down, sir.

48:11.460 --> 48:12.770
You're hurting me!

48:12.820 --> 48:15.290
- Stop resisting then it won't hurt.
- You're breaking my arm!

48:15.340 --> 48:16.610
Stop resisting!

48:16.660 --> 48:18.660
Polk Avenue Police, please move along!

48:19.940 --> 48:20.980
Ma'am, it's done.

48:24.060 --> 48:25.530
Sorry, ma'am.

48:25.580 --> 48:27.060
Do you want a minute with him?

48:29.460 --> 48:30.860
Just take him.

48:35.740 --> 48:39.170
There was no need to make a
scene. Look at your poor wife.

48:39.220 --> 48:41.450
I'm not saying anything until
I speak to my solicitor.

48:41.500 --> 48:44.050
- Well, fair enough.
- It's Jimmy Lakewell. L-A-K-E...

48:44.100 --> 48:46.700
- What's going on?
- It's all under control, it's all sorted.

49:51.940 --> 49:53.650
A delegation. I'm honoured.

49:53.700 --> 49:57.020
My two investigators, sir,
DS Arnott and DS Fleming.

49:59.180 --> 50:02.010
I cannot believe I failed to
make myself crystal clear.

50:02.060 --> 50:04.450
AC-12 is recused from the Huntley case,

50:04.500 --> 50:07.210
yet you still attempted to make arrests.

50:07.260 --> 50:09.330
Yes, sir, but some new
evidence has come to light,

50:09.380 --> 50:11.490
which we think is vitally
important to this inquiry.

50:11.540 --> 50:12.580
DS Fleming.

50:13.580 --> 50:17.370
We've learned Mr Huntley shares
a solicitor with Michael Farmer,

50:17.420 --> 50:20.090
and it's possible Mr Huntley
was aware of Michael Farmer's

50:20.140 --> 50:23.260
prior sexual offences,
via this relationship.

50:24.940 --> 50:27.490
- Right. - We also found that a
deposit supposedly of Tim Ifield's

50:27.540 --> 50:31.050
blood found at his flat was
contaminated with fibres from

50:31.100 --> 50:33.170
a forensic investigator's oversuit.

50:33.220 --> 50:35.490
And that the blood deposit
supposedly found on

50:35.540 --> 50:37.450
Leonie Collersdale's body was contaminated

50:37.500 --> 50:38.690
in exactly the same way.

50:38.740 --> 50:41.290
Clear indication of evidence
tampering, sir, pure and simple.

50:41.340 --> 50:44.290
Our interpretation is that someone
planted Timothy Ifield's blood

50:44.340 --> 50:46.810
on Leonie Collersdale's body
in order to falsely implicate

50:46.860 --> 50:48.730
Tim in her murder.

50:48.780 --> 50:50.610
Tim was onto a conspiracy, sir --

50:50.660 --> 50:53.090
the framing of Michael Farmer
to protect the real murderer.

50:53.140 --> 50:55.570
And, obviously, the person with
the opportunity and means to

50:55.620 --> 50:59.610
frame both Michael Farmer and
Timothy Ifield is DCI Roz Huntley.

50:59.660 --> 51:02.250
By arresting him, she's acting
as if she's been the one

51:02.300 --> 51:05.130
to ID her husband as the
murderer, while in reality

51:05.180 --> 51:07.250
she's been protecting him all this time.

51:07.300 --> 51:09.250
Also, she's just had surgery on her arm.

51:09.300 --> 51:11.610
No-one knew she had a problem
with it, and she's refusing

51:11.660 --> 51:14.450
access to her medical records, so
we've had to seek a court order.

51:14.500 --> 51:17.450
Naturally, sir, we'd like to
put things right straightaway.

51:17.500 --> 51:21.180
We'd like to arrest her on suspicion
of perverting the course of justice.

51:23.020 --> 51:25.690
But Leonie Collersdale's
and Tim Ifield's murders

51:25.740 --> 51:30.250
are DCI Huntley's cases and, to reiterate,

51:30.300 --> 51:33.170
you've been expressly
forbidden from looking into it.

51:33.220 --> 51:35.810
Yes, sir, but my team were
investigating another case,

51:35.860 --> 51:38.570
and our inquiries led us
unexpectedly to these findings,

51:38.620 --> 51:41.410
which I'm sure you'll agree, sir,
put a completely new complexion

51:41.460 --> 51:43.730
- on everything.
- What other case?

51:43.780 --> 51:46.890
That would be the disappearance
of Jackie Laverty, sir.

51:46.940 --> 51:49.740
A property developer, not seen since 2012.

51:53.260 --> 51:54.860
Something troubling you, sir?

51:56.940 --> 52:00.570
You'll recall, I was
Station Chief at that time.

52:00.620 --> 52:03.050
It's a difficult experience for us all.

52:03.100 --> 52:04.890
Sir.

52:04.940 --> 52:07.130
But this is great work.

52:07.180 --> 52:08.740
All of you, great work.

52:10.740 --> 52:14.650
But Roz Huntley had you recused
and you accused Nick Huntley

52:14.700 --> 52:16.850
of involvement in DS Arnott's injuries.

52:16.900 --> 52:18.770
I can't risk your investigation

52:18.820 --> 52:21.730
being tainted by accusations of bias.

52:21.780 --> 52:24.370
In my view, your files should
be handed over to a new,

52:24.420 --> 52:28.370
more impartial authority, and
they can decide the best way

52:28.420 --> 52:30.050
to take these inquiries forward.

52:30.100 --> 52:32.530
Sir, I must protest in the
strongest possible terms!

52:32.580 --> 52:34.020
Leave us.

52:36.980 --> 52:38.140
Very well.

53:00.860 --> 53:02.690
Paramedics are here. Let them at him.

53:02.740 --> 53:04.610
Just give me a second! Dot, stay with me.

53:04.660 --> 53:07.210
There's a network of corrupt
police officers doing the bidding

53:07.260 --> 53:08.530
of organised crime.

53:08.580 --> 53:11.010
This is an unsustainable
breach of protocol, sir.

53:11.060 --> 53:12.970
Who's in charge, Dot? That's who we want,

53:13.020 --> 53:15.250
the most senior officer
in this corrupt network.

53:15.300 --> 53:16.820
Who's top dog, Dot?

53:18.740 --> 53:21.010
- Caddy.
- You're the Caddy. We know that.

53:21.060 --> 53:23.260
- Come on, Dot. - Told. - "Told".

53:24.540 --> 53:26.980
You told someone? Someone very senior?

53:28.340 --> 53:29.650
Prom.

53:29.700 --> 53:32.210
Promotion? Someone promoted you?

53:32.260 --> 53:33.490
Who?

53:33.540 --> 53:36.130
Come on, Dot. Come in, he can't talk.

53:36.180 --> 53:39.610
Blink twice with the
first letter of his name.

53:39.660 --> 53:43.010
A, B, C, D,

53:43.060 --> 53:44.690
E, F,

53:44.740 --> 53:47.170
G, H, I...

53:47.220 --> 53:48.530
H.

53:48.580 --> 53:50.810
His name begins with H. Right.

53:50.860 --> 53:52.170
That's it, out of the way!

53:52.220 --> 53:53.650
I'll start bagging.

53:53.700 --> 53:54.820
Respiratory arrest.

53:59.420 --> 54:01.700
I see why you didn't want anyone sharing.

54:03.780 --> 54:05.140
H.

54:06.260 --> 54:09.170
Sir, there are currently eight
officers serving above the rank

54:09.220 --> 54:13.770
of inspector whose surnames begin
with an H, including yourself, sir.

54:13.820 --> 54:16.730
Others, if you consider those
who have relocated or retired.

54:16.780 --> 54:19.330
There's only one who was Matthew
Cottan's commanding officer

54:19.380 --> 54:23.970
for two years, who recruited him and
turned a blind eye to his offending.

54:24.020 --> 54:26.250
Yes, I recruited him, but
I did not promote him!

54:26.300 --> 54:30.210
Superintendent Hastings, you will be
served with a Regulation 15 notice.

54:30.260 --> 54:32.810
You will have ten working days
to answer these allegations

54:32.860 --> 54:37.530
and, should the review board remain
unsatisfied with your answers,

54:37.580 --> 54:39.890
you will face a disciplinary hearing.

54:39.940 --> 54:42.010
That is all.

54:42.060 --> 54:43.180
Dismissed.

54:44.980 --> 54:46.100
Sir.

55:09.580 --> 55:12.610
- I'm coming up.
- No, there's no need, honestly. I'm fine.

55:12.660 --> 55:15.380
No, no. I just want to make
sure you're doing all right.

55:25.500 --> 55:29.210
I didn't want occupational health to know.

55:29.260 --> 55:31.860
If I can't even look after
myself, how can I do my job?

55:36.380 --> 55:39.090
Steve, why don't you just...?

55:39.140 --> 55:42.530
Just take a few weeks
off, till you're stronger.

55:42.580 --> 55:44.890
Michael Farmer doesn't have weeks.

55:44.940 --> 55:46.980
It's his whole future on the line.

56:14.060 --> 56:15.220
I'll put the kettle on.

56:43.940 --> 56:46.260
You are going to get
better, aren't you, Steve?

56:48.900 --> 56:50.140
I don't know, Kate.

57:11.100 --> 57:12.930
You should sit down, ma'am.

57:12.980 --> 57:14.770
I can get you some more
of your painkillers.

57:14.820 --> 57:16.410
No, I'll be all right.

57:16.460 --> 57:17.730
Jimmy. Thank God.

57:17.780 --> 57:20.330
I want some time with my client
before we go through disclosure,

57:20.380 --> 57:22.890
- in a private room.
- I'll see what I can do.

57:22.940 --> 57:24.940
You'll do better than that, detective.

57:27.340 --> 57:28.620
I'm glad to see you, mate.

57:33.740 --> 57:36.130
Have you eaten? Do you
need something to drink?

57:36.180 --> 57:38.330
No, no, no, I'm fine.

57:38.380 --> 57:40.340
All right, Roz. I'll take it from here.

57:42.420 --> 57:44.020
Jimmy, this is insane!

57:45.340 --> 57:46.860
I have nothing to do with it.

57:48.340 --> 57:51.050
I don't know many that
would have had the guts.

57:51.100 --> 57:54.090
That was incredibly brave
and honest of you, ma'am.

57:54.140 --> 57:57.100
I've got no idea how this
can be happening to me.

57:58.260 --> 57:59.570
It was Roz.

57:59.620 --> 58:02.090
She's lying about everything.

58:02.140 --> 58:03.300
Everything.
