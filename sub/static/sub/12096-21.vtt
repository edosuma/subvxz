Danny's bringing home a girl.

I'm a nervous wreck.

01:24.600 --> 01:25.880
Mary, what are you
nervous about?

01:26.040 --> 01:29.192
Listen, a guy brings home a girl,
it's important. It's serious.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.757
I don't know. I used to
bring them home because
I couldn't pay for dinner.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.354
I hope she likes us.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.597

She's the one
being brought home.

be nervous, not you.

Danny likes a lot.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.240
Someone special, you know?

02:04.440 --> 02:06.875
So I think we ought to get
to know her a little longer

02:07.080 --> 02:08.991
before we spring
certain things on her.

02:09.479 --> 02:11.038
Like what?

02:12.080 --> 02:15.198
Like if you get the urge
to become invisible, for example.

I think that you ought
to get to know her

02:19.160 --> 02:21.231

see you do that.

I was overprotective.

a woman in three years.

and you say "Go"?

Sheriff Tinkler about that too.

he could look for your tie.

they never do.

see him, they'll kill him.

left last night, did he say
where he was going?

11:19.880 --> 11:22.475
Oh, Chester. You know it doesn't
matter where he says he's going.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.240
You remember the last time
he said he was going for a walk

11:25.440 --> 11:28.353
and he overpowered the driver
of that Löwenbräu beer truck

11:28.560 --> 11:30.711
and claimed it for America?

11:32.760 --> 11:35.434
Well, maybe Benson
knows where he is.

11:35.640 --> 11:36.790
Where's Benson?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.320
Mother, is that what
you're wearing to court?

11:38.520 --> 11:39.520
Well, yes.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.194
Well, I don't know
about that dress.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.960
I mean, I think what you
wanna do is wear a colour that's
the most sympathetic to the jury.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.713
Jessica, where's Benson?

11:46.920 --> 11:49.640
Black should do it. I mean,
widows wear black to funerals

11:49.840 --> 11:52.196
and look how much sympathy
they get.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.791
No, I think black
is too depressing.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.310
Eunice. Jessica. Benson.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.556
What about Benson, dear?

11:58.760 --> 12:00.479
Where is he?
I don't know, Chester.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.117
Perhaps he's with Daddy
and your new tie.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.837
Benson, where's the major?

12:09.040 --> 12:11.475
How am I supposed to know?

12:12.200 --> 12:15.671
You look wonderful, Benson.
Thank you.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.916
Benson, you know
the major gets in trouble.
You're supposed to watch him.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.352
Ah, ah, ah. It ain't my job
to watch him.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.792
Now, the only thing I got to
watch around here is what's
cooking in my oven.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.229
You want me to watch him,

12:28.440 --> 12:31.592
you put him on a platter with
a lot of little potatoes around.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.709
You know, Jessica,
it's a good thing I'm not a bigot,

12:35.920 --> 12:38.560
because if I were,
I could say a few things right here.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.989
Like what?

12:41.200 --> 12:44.272
Beige. You should wear beige.
Beige is the perfect colour, Mother.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.915
Benson, I think
I tied this wrong.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.713
That's my tie.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.721
That's right. See, I don't
have one of my own.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.309
So I asked Benson to pick one
of yours that would be suitable.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.671
You gave him my new tie?

12:55.880 --> 12:57.394
How about that?

12:58.680 --> 13:01.149
He can't wear that.
I'm wearing that.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.511
It's all yours.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.675
Major, where have you been?

13:07.880 --> 13:08.880
Hi, Gramps.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.793
Daddy, where have you been?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.553
Chester, he's not answering.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.433
I can see that, Jessica.

13:15.640 --> 13:19.600
But he is smiling,
so wherever he's been,
it was nice.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.840
I think I am in love.

13:23.040 --> 13:25.430
Chester, Daddy's got a girlfriend.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.040
Ugh.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.233
Where did you meet her, Daddy?

13:30.440 --> 13:32.432
I met her in the cemetery.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.279
I go to see my old friends there.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.474
I have lots of friends there,
and there she was.

13:38.680 --> 13:41.036
Sheeba Fifer.

13:41.240 --> 13:44.039
That's her name,
and I'm in love with her.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.630

I don't think I know the family.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.880
Where did you spend the night?

13:55.520 --> 13:58.115
Colonel, as an officer
and a gentleman,

13:58.320 --> 14:00.516
you shouldn't even ask
that question.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.393
This is the real thing.
This is it.

14:04.600 --> 14:09.516
I haven't felt like this
since my dear, departed,

14:21.320 --> 14:23.710
Jessica, come on out of there.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.634
Jessica, this is a murder trial.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.797
It's not a party
where it's chic to be late.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.601
JESSICA: I'm not going.
What do you mean?

14:29.720 --> 14:31.552
I'm not going.
You're not going at all?

14:31.760 --> 14:33.080
I'm not going at all.
I see.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.590
You know they'll put you
in jail for this, Jessica.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.952
Jessica, I'm not going to
let you do this to yourself.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.072
Well, I'll have to
break down the door.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.069
Stand back, Jess, because
the wood is going to fly.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.396
Nice work, Clint.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.559
Good, solid door. They don't
make doors like this anymore.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.240
When are we going?

15:00.440 --> 15:02.636
As soon as I get your mother
out of the bathroom.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.833
Benson, I want you to go
downstairs, get a ladder, go up...

15:06.040 --> 15:07.997
Go up on the roof
and through the window.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.078
Is he talking to me?

15:10.680 --> 15:11.955
What, are you crazy?

15:12.160 --> 15:14.038
I ain't going up on no roof.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.436
You go up on the roof.
I'll do it.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.393
No, you won't.
BILLY: Oh, come on.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.479
Last time you were up
on the roof, you spent
the summer in traction.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.399
I ain't going up on the roof
and neither are you.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.920
We've gotta get her
out of there, Benson.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.236
So you go up there.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.830
Well, Benson, don't you think
I would if I could?

15:29.040 --> 15:30.474
No.

15:31.560 --> 15:34.314
Well, I can't. I get nosebleeds.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.590
Nosebleeds?

15:35.800 --> 15:38.190
I'll give you nosebleeds.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.592
All right, all right. I'll do it.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.395
JESSICA:
No, Benson. I don't want
you climbing on that roof.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.600
It's dangerous.

15:44.760 --> 15:48.197
Well, I'm gonna have to
go up on the roof if you
don't get out of there.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.393
So if I go up there
and break my neck,
it'll be on your head.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.513
Thank you.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.396
Don't be afraid, Jess.

You won't be found guilty.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.600
Oh, I know that, Chester.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.759
And I'm not really afraid of that.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.110
What are you afraid of?

16:09.320 --> 16:11.357
Well, I can't tell you.
You'd think I'm crazy.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.438
No, I won't.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.155
I'm afraid for the trial
to be over.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.113
What, are you crazy...?

16:19.400 --> 16:20.516
Why, Jess?

16:20.720 --> 16:22.837
Because it's brought us
close together.

16:23.040 --> 16:25.919
We're close now, Chester.
We talk, we laugh, we drink wine.

16:26.120 --> 16:29.238
We spend our evenings together
and our weekends together.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.636
It's been just like
a honeymoon, Chester.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.641
Well, that's the way
it usually happens, Jess.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.800
It generally takes a crisis
to bring people together.

16:35.840 --> 16:38.355
But it's just been so wonderful,
I don't want it to end.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.280
And I'm afraid that when
the trial's over it will.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.834
But why?

16:43.040 --> 16:46.272
Well, you know,
if I'm found innocent,

16:46.480 --> 16:48.312
then the crisis will be over.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.716
And we'll just go back
to being strangers.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.276
And if I'm found guilty,
it'll definitely be over,

16:53.480 --> 16:55.790
because I'll be on death row.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.075
That won't happen, Jess.
I won't let it. I promise.

Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

21:29.000 --> 21:31.913
we have here an unusual case.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.796
Unusual in the sense that,
this being a small town,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.640
the defendant is familiar
to most of you.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.479
You must, however,

21:40.680 --> 21:44.594
I repeat, you must divorce yourself
from any previous opinions

21:44.800 --> 21:46.871
you may have of the defendant,

21:47.080 --> 21:52.200
and instead pay attention
only to what you hear in this room.

21:52.400 --> 21:55.438
And what you will
hear in this room,
ladies and gentlemen,

21:55.640 --> 22:00.795
is, I'm afraid, a chilling story
of how a wife and mother

22:01.360 --> 22:05.115
cold-bloodedly, methodically,
and with malice aforethought,

22:05.320 --> 22:06.470
committed murder.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.359
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
it is true.

how Jessica Tate,

frustrated woman...

22:25.960 --> 22:27.440
What?

22:27.640 --> 22:31.395
With hate in her heart,
in cold blood,

22:31.600 --> 22:33.193
murdered Peter Campbell.

22:33.400 --> 22:37.030
Oh, please, Mr. Franklin.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.719
I have never heard anything
so rude and awful in all my life.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.071
Now, Mrs. Tate,
one more word from you

22:48.280 --> 22:50.158
and I'm gonna hold you
in contempt.

22:50.360 --> 22:51.430
Me?

22:51.640 --> 22:54.678
Well, if there's any
contempt around here,
it's coming from him.

22:54.880 --> 22:58.157
I have never heard anything
so contemptible in all my life.

22:58.360 --> 23:00.750
And I am not going
to stand for it.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.713
I'm going.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.559
[CHATTERING]

23:08.600 --> 23:09.750
All right.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.519
All right, all right, I'll stay.

23:11.720 --> 23:12.870
But I must warn you,

23:13.080 --> 23:16.835
if you continue in this manner,
I will not come back tomorrow.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.110
Go on now, but be nice.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.836
The prosecution
will attempt to show,
ladies and gentlemen...

23:29.720 --> 23:31.677
