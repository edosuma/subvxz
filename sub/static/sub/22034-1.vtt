[♪♪♪]

00:11.212 --> 00:12.144
Yeah, no.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.646
I know, Brad.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.815
Okay.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.685
I know, Brad,
I'll be there at 9:00 sharp.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.686
Oh, don't worry,

00:20.721 --> 00:22.755
the studio sent over a suit
for me to wear.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.157
I guess they didn't trust
my fashion sense.

00:25.192 --> 00:28.360
Yes, I know what a big deal
this is for us.

00:28.396 --> 00:32.497
No, I won't forget
the signed movie poster.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.766
I will see you later.

00:33.801 --> 00:34.867
Okay, bye.

Angela Young?

00:47.381 --> 00:48.580
Yes, that's me.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.251
Thank you.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.889
Headed to
the Book Expo?

00:56.924 --> 00:58.590
Yes, I'm an author.

00:58.626 --> 00:59.558
Oh, great.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.492
Anything I'd have heard of?

01:00.528 --> 01:02.261
It's a book series
called "Time Visitor."

01:02.296 --> 01:03.862
They just turned it
into a movie.

01:03.898 --> 01:06.098
Congratulations
on all your success.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.299
Thank you so much.

01:07.334 --> 01:11.503
Now all I need is some time
in my schedule to enjoy it.

01:12.807 --> 01:16.275
[♪♪♪]

01:25.086 --> 01:26.218
Are they all
here for you?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.953
Oh, I doubt it.

01:27.988 --> 01:28.988
Oh, there's my sister.

01:29.023 --> 01:30.222
I can let myself out.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.323
Okay.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.291
Hey, thank you again.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.292
Have a great weekend.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.327
Thanks, you too.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.527
Thank you.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.098
Hey.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.133
Sorry I'm late.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.066
It's okay,
I'm used to it.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.067
Take this.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.103
Okay.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.403
Ready?
Let's do this.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.871
Yeah.

01:46.941 --> 01:47.773
When did you get here?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.074
About a half hour ago,

01:49.110 --> 01:50.042
I had to drop off
some books

01:50.077 --> 01:51.844
at the TV studio
for your interview later,

01:51.879 --> 01:53.479
and I just
left my car there

01:53.514 --> 01:55.080
and took a cab
over here.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.293
Have I ever told you
you're a great assistant?

01:56.317 --> 01:57.850
About a hundred times.

01:57.885 --> 01:58.817
But you can always
say it again.

01:58.853 --> 02:00.185
[chuckling]

02:00.221 --> 02:02.121
Oh, my God, wow,
you look amazing.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.422
Oh, can you believe this?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.691
I think this suit
costs more than my car.

02:05.726 --> 02:06.970
Well, you're practically
a celebrity these days.

02:06.994 --> 02:07.793
You've gotta look the part.

02:07.828 --> 02:08.794
[sighs]

02:08.829 --> 02:09.928
How's Brad?

02:09.964 --> 02:11.830
Is he in full
control-freak mode yet?

02:11.866 --> 02:13.499
Yeah, but
that's nothing new.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.766
How are you feeling?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.702
Yeah, you know,
I'm-I'm a little nervous.

02:16.737 --> 02:17.870
Yeah.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.338
Actually, I'm a lot nervous.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.784
The hype behind the movie
is pretty crazy, huh?

02:20.808 --> 02:21.773
Yeah.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.675
I think this is about
to be your new normal.

02:23.711 --> 02:24.711
[sighs nervously]

02:26.814 --> 02:28.514
[both gushing] Aw...

02:28.549 --> 02:30.282
I love your costume.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.318
Athena's my favorite character
in the whole world.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.386
Really?

02:34.421 --> 02:35.954
What do you like most about her?

02:35.990 --> 02:37.990
She's not afraid of anything.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.658
[chuckles] Exactly.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.627
I wish I had her confidence
right about now.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.861
Have fun today, okay?

02:42.897 --> 02:43.897
Bye.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.065
Oh, so cute...

02:47.101 --> 02:49.668
Okay, so, uh,
we're here till 11:00,

02:49.703 --> 02:52.137
then at 12:00, you've got
your radio interviews.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.873
3:00, you are pre-taping
for <i> Beantown Today,</i>

02:54.909 --> 02:55.807
and then at 6:00,

02:55.843 --> 02:57.521
you and Brad are hopping
on a flight to L.A.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.022
for your big movie premiere
tomorrow night.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.846
Gee, is that all?

03:00.881 --> 03:02.159
I really wish you were coming
with us to Los Angeles.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.148
I know,

03:03.184 --> 03:05.417
but I've got that wedding
to go to on Saturday.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.730
Yeah, I just can't imagine
surviving a red carpet

03:06.754 --> 03:08.053
without you.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.721
I can't do this...

03:09.757 --> 03:11.023
Oh, no, you don't.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.024
What? I just need some air,

03:12.059 --> 03:13.091
and some coffee,

03:13.127 --> 03:14.893
and probably
some more sleep.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.072
I promise I'll be right back.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.196
Uh, yeah, right,

03:17.231 --> 03:18.875
you always try to run
every time you feel overwhelmed.

03:18.899 --> 03:19.943
You've been doing it
since we were kids.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.868
Come on, I'm a writer,
I didn't sign up for this.

03:22.903 --> 03:23.903
Writing is the hard part.

03:23.938 --> 03:25.270
This is supposed to be fun.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.449
Oh, really?
You wanna trade places?

03:26.473 --> 03:27.706
Not a chance.

03:27.741 --> 03:28.907
But don't worry,

03:28.943 --> 03:30.220
I'll be at the back
of the theatre

03:30.244 --> 03:31.877
watching the entire time.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.011
[sighing nervously]

03:33.047 --> 03:35.113
Take me to my happy place,
take to my happy place...

03:35.149 --> 03:39.051
take me
to my happy place.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.821
[♪♪♪]

03:48.829 --> 03:50.762
All right, little man,

03:50.798 --> 03:53.398
looks to me like you are gonna
get to keep those tonsils.

03:53.434 --> 03:54.733
What do you think
of that?

03:54.768 --> 03:55.734
Is that a good thing?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.102
[roaring playfully]

03:57.137 --> 03:58.737
Is he going
to be okay, Doctor?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.739
He is gonna be just fine.

04:02.243 --> 04:03.976
So, his glands
are a little swollen,

04:04.011 --> 04:05.143
his throat's
still inflamed,

04:05.179 --> 04:06.256
but he should be good
by next week.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.280
Thank you.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.146
You're welcome.

04:08.182 --> 04:10.315
Quinn, what do you say
to Dr. Callan?

04:10.351 --> 04:12.317
Thank you, Dr. Cow-man.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.786
You're welcome, cowboy.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.721
Whoa, look at
all that wax in your ear.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.555
Let me get that.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.591
What?

04:18.625 --> 04:19.423
[gasps]

04:19.459 --> 04:20.892
Thank you.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.561
You're welcome.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.596
Okay, see you later.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.936
Hey, guys.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.571
Good morning, sweetheart.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.150
Did you guys have fun
with Nana this morning?

04:34.174 --> 04:35.274
Yeah, it was good.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.910
We went blueberry picking,
and then we made pancakes.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.990
What? That sounds like
the perfect start

04:40.014 --> 04:41.513
to the most
perfect day ever.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.282
What about you,
Emily?

04:43.317 --> 04:44.283
What?

04:44.318 --> 04:45.284
Oh, sorry.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.685
Yeah, it was fun.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.420
Alex ate, like,
40 pancakes.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.155
We're going to go
to the bookstore.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.023
Come on, Alex.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.024
Bye, Nana!

04:52.059 --> 04:53.059
Bye, dear.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.330
Wow, do you remember

04:58.365 --> 05:00.010
when she used to ask
permission to go someplace?

05:00.034 --> 05:02.100
Now she just
kind of tells me.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.303
She's growing up,
finding her voice.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.837
Before you know it,
she'll be dating.

05:05.873 --> 05:06.638
For some topics,

05:06.674 --> 05:08.018
I prefer to keep
my head in the sand

05:08.042 --> 05:08.874
if that's okay with you.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.709
Jeff...

05:10.744 --> 05:12.778
Emily needs
someone younger

05:12.813 --> 05:14.613
who can relate to her
better than I can.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.683
And, more importantly,
you need someone.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.885
Thank you so much
for worrying about me.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.021
I should probably go
check on the kids,

05:23.057 --> 05:25.338
make sure they're not getting
into any trouble down there.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.831
Making yourself
comfortable, I see.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.801
What's on the Callan Family
best-seller list?

05:35.836 --> 05:38.070
I'm reading
a Japanese comic book.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.137
Cool.

05:39.173 --> 05:42.074
Emily, how about you?

05:42.109 --> 05:43.709
The new book
in the Time Visitor series.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.245
I've told you
about it, Dad.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.848
It's about a girl named Athena
who can travel through time.

05:49.883 --> 05:50.982
She's totally amazing.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.517
Cool.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.188
Time-traveling teens?

05:56.223 --> 05:59.758
Who comes up with this stuff?

05:59.793 --> 06:01.671
<i>[movie trailer voiceover]:

figure something out,</i>

much time!</i>

06:26.120 --> 06:28.220
Hey, sorry I'm late,

06:28.255 --> 06:29.733
I got stuck on a call
with the film studio.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.189
You look great.

06:31.225 --> 06:31.990
Look at this!

06:32.025 --> 06:33.525
The audience
is loving the movie.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.594
Yeah... I'm kinda
freaking out, Brad.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.028
Are you kidding me?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.475
I always said you were
going to be a big star,

06:38.499 --> 06:40.532
and now it is
actually happening.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.644
Okay, I need Boyfriend Brad
right now, not Manager Brad.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.634
Stop...

06:42.669 --> 06:43.713
Aw, come on, I just need
a little more content

06:43.737 --> 06:44.703
for the website.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.670
Put it down...

06:45.706 --> 06:46.750
Okay, phone's going away,
phone's going away.

06:46.774 --> 06:47.906
It's just me and you.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.709
Listen, you've worked so hard
to get to this moment, okay?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.210
All you have to do
is go out there

06:52.246 --> 06:53.645
and be yourself.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.046
Be funny, be charming,

06:55.082 --> 06:56.548
be... you.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.116
Yeah, well, I'd feel
a lot more like me

06:58.152 --> 07:00.285
if I were behind a laptop

07:00.320 --> 07:01.586
in a coffee shop,

07:01.622 --> 07:03.989
not in front of 400 people
on a stage.

07:04.024 --> 07:04.956
You know what, maybe
you just need some food

07:04.992 --> 07:05.992
to calm your nerves.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.093
Here, I've got some nuts.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.562
These are delicious.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.908
Brad, how long
have we been dating?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.331
- Hmm?
- I'm allergic to nuts!

07:13.367 --> 07:14.900
- What? Really?
- Yes, Brad.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.134
My throat closes up,

07:16.170 --> 07:17.180
and I just break
into hives.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.336
Ew, that is not
a good look.

07:18.372 --> 07:21.573
Okay, no nuts.
Good to know.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.808
<i>Well, as you know,</i>

07:22.843 --> 07:25.610
<i>we have a very special guest
for you right now.</i>

07:40.327 --> 07:42.794
[camera apps clicking]

07:42.830 --> 07:44.062
She's got this.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.366
Oh, wow, that is
seriously bright.

07:48.535 --> 07:49.935
[snapping and clicking]

07:49.970 --> 07:52.103
Please tell me
there are no more interviews.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.683
Okay, I got a call from
<i>Good Morning America,</i>

07:53.707 --> 07:54.873
and they'd love
to have her

07:54.908 --> 07:56.174
the Tuesday
after the premiere.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.108
No, no, no, no.
No can do.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.043
We've got the opening

07:58.078 --> 07:59.189
of the Time Visitor
pop-up store in Chicago

07:59.213 --> 08:00.213
on Tuesday.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.146
Can they do Wednesday?

08:01.181 --> 08:02.848
Brad, you're supposed
to be on a flight

08:02.883 --> 08:03.815
to Beijing
on Thursday

08:03.851 --> 08:04.851
for the next premiere.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.184
Yeah, I know.
We'll make it work.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.186
She's going to be
really jetlagged.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.120
Hey, we can all rest

08:09.156 --> 08:10.700
after the movie makes
a $100 million, okay?

08:10.724 --> 08:11.656
The better
the movie does,

08:11.692 --> 08:13.058
the more books
we sell, right?

08:13.093 --> 08:13.892
[cell phone rings]
Hang on, I gotta grab this.

08:13.927 --> 08:14.826
Go for Brad.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.194
[Angela]: Do you remember

08:16.230 --> 08:18.864
when we went canoeing
in Nantucket last fall?

08:18.899 --> 08:21.466
I wish we could
do that again.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.334
Hey, I got it!

08:22.369 --> 08:23.735
Why don't we rent a canoe,

08:23.770 --> 08:25.303
just for a few hours?

08:25.339 --> 08:26.805
Aw, I'm sorry, honey,

08:26.840 --> 08:29.708
You go live on <i> Beantown</i>
in less than an hour.

08:29.743 --> 08:30.976
Right.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.844
Okay, the most beautiful
season of the year,

08:32.880 --> 08:33.912
and I get to see it all

08:33.947 --> 08:35.547
through the limousine window.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.482
You guys aren't
going to believe this.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.028
We just closed the deal
for three more books!

08:39.052 --> 08:40.052
What?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.886
Three more books?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.399
Three? I mean,
how could you not tell me

08:43.423 --> 08:44.467
this deal was in the works?

08:44.491 --> 08:45.869
Listen, I didn't want
to bother you with the details

08:45.893 --> 08:47.058
because I had no idea

08:47.094 --> 08:48.527
the deal would
close this quickly.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.828
Did you know
about this?

08:49.863 --> 08:52.163
I swear, I just found out
when you did.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.199
Congratulations?

08:53.233 --> 08:54.233
Am I missing
something?

08:54.268 --> 08:55.133
I thought
you'd be excited.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.202
Brad, "Time Visitor"
was supposed to be

08:57.237 --> 08:58.436
a three-book series.

08:58.472 --> 08:59.871
Athena's story is over.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.039
I want to tell new stories.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.074
I get that, but, honey,

09:02.109 --> 09:03.219
your publishers
are giving you

09:03.243 --> 09:04.943
a gigantic bonus.

09:04.978 --> 09:08.413
Yes, but it's not about
the money for me, Brad.

09:08.448 --> 09:09.926
I started writing because
I loved telling stories

09:09.950 --> 09:11.716
that would inspire
young people.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.085
But now all I do lately
is go to meetings

09:14.121 --> 09:15.587
about Athena apps
and video games.

09:15.622 --> 09:16.622
And theme parks,

09:16.657 --> 09:18.256
don't forget the theme parks.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.190
Kidding, kidding.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.060
Look, I understand
it's overwhelming, okay?

09:22.095 --> 09:24.129
But come on, this is
every author's dream.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.731
No, Brad,
this is your dream.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.044
Look, how am I even
supposed to be inspired

09:28.068 --> 09:28.800
to write something new

09:28.835 --> 09:30.602
when all I do is
go to interviews?

09:30.637 --> 09:32.237
Do you want, like,
a cup of tea, Ange?

09:32.272 --> 09:33.405
No.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.440
No, I don't want a tea.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.475
I want a break.

09:37.511 --> 09:38.944
For a week.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.779
Okay, just even
for a few days.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.280
I want to see foliage,

09:42.316 --> 09:43.281
I want to go apple picking,

09:43.317 --> 09:44.382
I want to
carve a pumpkin!

09:45.752 --> 09:47.452
It's fall, you guys!

09:47.487 --> 09:49.087
Hey, I love
apple picking, too.

09:49.122 --> 09:49.888
I get it,

09:49.923 --> 09:52.057
and I understand
that you're tired,

09:52.092 --> 09:53.736
but we have to strike
while the iron is hot.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.505
Well, that's not the answer
I was looking for.

09:55.529 --> 09:57.295
Hi, Ms. Young,
we need you on set.

09:57.331 --> 09:59.397
Thank you.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.398
[sighing]

10:00.434 --> 10:01.366
Ange, listen.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.079
Okay, look, I am not happy
if you're not happy.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.169
So, talk to me,

10:04.204 --> 10:05.136
what can I do
to make you feel better?

10:05.172 --> 10:06.137
Be spontaneous.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.606
Just this once.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.007
Run away with me
for the weekend.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.241
We can go
to the Berkshires.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.110
No cell phones,
no computers?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.778
What do you say?

10:13.814 --> 10:15.447
Let's do it.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.815
Really?

10:16.850 --> 10:17.850
Sure, why not?

10:20.220 --> 10:20.919
You don't mean today?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.354
Honey, we have
the movie premiere

10:22.389 --> 10:24.155
in L.A. tomorrow night.
We can't miss that.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.458
Right, the movie premiere.

10:26.493 --> 10:27.325
Look, I promise you,

10:27.361 --> 10:28.927
we'll take a trip
after the holidays.

10:28.962 --> 10:29.861
But for now,
all you have to do

10:29.896 --> 10:31.763
is go out there,
do this one last interview,

10:31.798 --> 10:33.264
and we are out of here, okay?

10:35.068 --> 10:36.101
You got this.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.136
You're great.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.479
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.480
Nice to meet you.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.515
Nice to meet you, too.

10:55.689 --> 10:56.821
Thank you.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.826
Okay, everyone,
five minutes to air.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.397
[cell phone rings]

11:05.432 --> 11:06.765
Oh, sorry.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.535
Yeah, go for Brad.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.370
Oh, Jennifer,
how are you?

11:12.406 --> 11:16.041
Yes, very exciting,
I know, I know...

11:16.076 --> 11:17.086
[Brad negotiating
on cell phone]

11:17.110 --> 11:19.110
Okay, we are in L.A.,
so we can make that work...

11:21.782 --> 11:23.181
No, no, Angela
is totally available

11:23.216 --> 11:25.350
and very interested...

11:25.385 --> 11:27.919
Right.

11:27.954 --> 11:28.820
That's great,

11:28.855 --> 11:30.855
we wanted to talk
with the guys over there

11:30.891 --> 11:31.656
about merchandising.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.224
The dolls were great,
we loved them.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.826
A couple
little changes...

11:34.861 --> 11:38.396
Yeah, just
some little things,

11:38.432 --> 11:41.399
but it's all very exciting,

11:41.435 --> 11:43.001
and Angela is
very much on board.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.839
The amusement park?
Great idea, uh-huh.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.514
I was thinking about
the roller coaster...

11:53.146 --> 11:54.457
Excuse me, I was looking
for that woman

11:54.481 --> 11:55.714
I saw you with
earlier today,

11:55.749 --> 11:57.382
the one with
the blue Pontiac

11:57.417 --> 11:59.184
parked in
the tow-away zone?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.585
It's about to get towed.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.686
Oh, okay, no problem.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.722
It's my sister.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.067
I'm actually headed out
to move it right now.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.091
Thank you.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.860
What? I'm sorry, what?

12:08.895 --> 12:09.895
Just a second.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.609
Have you seen Ms. Young?
We go live in two minutes.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.066
What are you talking about?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.102
She was sitting on set
like, a second ago.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.703
Control room,
our guest is M.I.A.,

12:18.739 --> 12:19.904
we're gonna need
to pinch hit.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.239
What's going on?
Where is Angela?

12:21.274 --> 12:22.207
She pulled
a disappearing act,

12:22.242 --> 12:23.242
is where she is.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.276
What?

12:24.311 --> 12:26.644
Angela? Ange!

12:26.680 --> 12:28.246
Angela!

12:28.281 --> 12:31.149
Ange, they need you on set,
like, right this second.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.051
I am dialing her cell.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.123
[♪♪♪]

12:40.427 --> 12:42.560
Well, wherever she is,
she's not answering.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.629
Maybe she went out for a walk?

12:44.664 --> 12:46.164
Yeah, more like
a long drive.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.477
<i>[Angela, over voice message]:
Sorry,</i>

12:47.501 --> 12:49.100
<i>I just needed time to myself.</i>

12:49.136 --> 12:50.580
<i>Don't worry, I'm fine.
I took Cynthia's car.</i>

12:50.604 --> 12:51.936
Oh, what is
she thinking...

12:54.274 --> 12:55.673
Well, well, Vermont,

12:55.709 --> 12:57.175
it's nice to see you again,

12:57.210 --> 12:59.144
I'm Angela. I'm an Aries.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.945
I like Audrey Hepburn films,

13:00.981 --> 13:03.281
and, uh, salt water taffy,

13:03.316 --> 13:05.517
and talking to myself.

13:05.552 --> 13:08.319
[thunder rumbles overhead]

13:11.224 --> 13:14.125
However, I'm not too crazy
about this rain,

13:14.161 --> 13:16.795
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd just... lay off.

13:16.830 --> 13:17.996
[thunder rumbling]

13:18.031 --> 13:21.266
Come on, Vermont,
work with me.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.301
It's been a beautiful drive
up until now.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.269
[truck horn blares past]

13:24.304 --> 13:25.637
[wincing] Ooh, wow...

13:25.672 --> 13:27.105
That's bright.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.540
[branches splintering]

13:28.575 --> 13:29.607
Whoa!

13:29.643 --> 13:30.742
[tires squealing]

13:32.813 --> 13:34.679
[car crashing]

13:37.484 --> 13:40.819
[♪♪♪]

13:55.268 --> 13:56.167
Uh... ma'am?

13:56.203 --> 13:58.670
Excuse me, ma'am?

13:58.705 --> 13:59.705
Are you okay?

13:59.739 --> 14:00.839
Me?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.342
I'm fine.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.146
I'm Kevin Gaines,
the town sheriff.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.215
Uh, what's your name?

14:11.518 --> 14:12.518
My name?

14:18.692 --> 14:20.358
I have no idea.

14:24.965 --> 14:25.864
[gasping]

14:25.899 --> 14:27.165
It's okay,
take it easy.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.266
What happened?

14:28.301 --> 14:31.669
You were in
some sort of accident,

14:31.705 --> 14:34.072
but you don't need
to worry, okay?

14:34.107 --> 14:35.039
I'm a doctor,

14:35.075 --> 14:36.686
in case the lab coat
didn't give that away.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.009
Dr. Callan.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.778
Yes.

14:40.814 --> 14:42.413
How did you... know that?

14:42.449 --> 14:43.882
Your name is on your coat.

14:45.785 --> 14:46.751
Yes, it is.

14:46.786 --> 14:47.719
Glad to see

14:47.754 --> 14:49.921
the cognitive skills are
working, that's good.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.389
Where am I?

14:51.424 --> 14:54.092
Well, you are in Hopedale,

14:54.127 --> 14:56.127
in the fine state of Vermont.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.596
I've never heard of Hopedale.

14:58.632 --> 14:59.564
I didn't think so.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.466
I'm the only doctor
here in this small town,

15:01.501 --> 15:02.945
I figured we would have
crossed paths by now.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.370
Listen, more
importantly,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.538
can you tell me anything
about yourself?

15:08.775 --> 15:10.742
No.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.210
Hmm.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.278
It's too bad

15:13.313 --> 15:15.193
your name wasn't embroidered
on your shirt, huh?

15:16.349 --> 15:19.717
Sorry, that was a bad joke.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.586
Do you have any idea
what's going on with me?

15:21.621 --> 15:22.987
Why can't I remember anything?

15:23.023 --> 15:24.066
Okay, well,
I don't know right now,

15:24.090 --> 15:25.723
but I'm going to guess

15:25.759 --> 15:28.092
that judging from
the little cut on your head,

15:28.128 --> 15:29.327
that you've suffered

15:29.362 --> 15:31.896
some sort of post-traumatic
memory loss.

15:31.932 --> 15:33.064
Now, it's okay,
don't panic.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.766
You didn't have a concussion,

15:34.801 --> 15:36.935
and the memory loss normally
doesn't last that long.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.469
I should have had a purse,

15:38.505 --> 15:39.904
some sort of I.D...

15:39.940 --> 15:41.172
Um, oh, a phone.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.408
We can go
to my recent calls...

15:43.443 --> 15:44.620
You didn't have a bag
or a phone

15:44.644 --> 15:45.755
when I found you
this morning.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.178
Just the clothes
you were wearing.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.147
Hello again.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.682
I'm the sheriff.
We met earlier.

15:50.717 --> 15:52.850
Yes, I-I remember that.

15:52.886 --> 15:53.818
Thank you for your help
this morning.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.320
No problem.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.601
Listen, if there's anybody
out there looking for you,

15:58.625 --> 15:59.625
Kevin will find them.

16:00.961 --> 16:01.859
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

16:01.895 --> 16:02.895
I will be back, okay?

16:07.634 --> 16:08.766
I thought
this kind of thing

16:08.802 --> 16:10.034
only happened
in the movies.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.103
Nope, it's a real thing,
all right.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.706
But as I mentioned to her,
it shouldn't last that long.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.607
So you have no idea
where she's from?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.609
Unfortunately, no.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.478
No one's been reported
missing in the area.

16:20.513 --> 16:21.412
Hmm.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.514
It's like she just
dropped out of the sky

16:23.550 --> 16:24.550
into our little town.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.584
Wow.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.396
Guess you've got
your work cut out for you, huh?

16:27.420 --> 16:28.553
Yeah.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.132
Actually, you mind if I ask her
a few more questions?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.557
You know, she's actually
been through a lot.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.993
Let's just leave it
for now.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.627
Whatever you say, doc.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.996
In the meantime,

16:38.031 --> 16:38.997
I'll go file
a missing person's report

16:39.032 --> 16:40.198
and see what we can find.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.065
Okay, I'll see you later.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.500
All right.

16:47.040 --> 16:47.972
[knocking]

16:48.008 --> 16:48.973
Hey.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.042
Hi.

16:51.077 --> 16:51.909
I don't understand.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.911
I know who
all these celebrities are,

16:53.947 --> 16:56.748
but I can't remember a single
detail about my life?

16:56.783 --> 16:58.916
You are gonna be
just fine, all right?

16:58.952 --> 17:00.232
Your memory will come back soon.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.320
How long is soon?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.321
Well, best-case scenario,
a day or two.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.589
Worst-case scenario?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.657
Well, uh... could be a week?

17:07.694 --> 17:08.893
A week?

17:08.928 --> 17:09.894
Okay, don't get upset.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.540
You're only going
to make it worse, all right?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.531
I just need you to relax.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.767
[exhaling] Okay, okay,
so what-what happens next?

17:15.801 --> 17:17.769
Do I, um...

17:17.804 --> 17:18.869
do I get a cast?
A sling?

17:18.905 --> 17:19.871
Did you break anything?

17:19.906 --> 17:21.672
I don't think so.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.741
Okay, then... no?

17:23.777 --> 17:25.209
Oh.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.344
Tell you what, uh...

17:27.881 --> 17:28.881
Want a lollipop?

17:31.418 --> 17:32.850
Thanks.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.752
Look, I was just going
to get you...

17:34.788 --> 17:36.220
some scrubs

17:36.256 --> 17:37.622
that you can change into,

17:37.657 --> 17:38.689
if you like.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.124
I hope the shoes fit.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.426
They're my nurse's.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.330
I'll leave you with that, okay?

17:48.968 --> 17:49.968
Oh, actually,

17:50.003 --> 17:51.969
what should I call you?

17:52.005 --> 17:53.071
Huh?

17:53.106 --> 17:54.072
I was thinking that

17:54.107 --> 17:55.873
we should probably
give you a name, you know.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.575
Oh, right, uh...

17:57.610 --> 17:59.077
Yeah, that makes sense.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.112
Cheryl.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.746
Does that work?

18:01.781 --> 18:02.880
Uh...

18:02.916 --> 18:05.083
I don't really feel like
a Cheryl.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.418
Hmm. Um...

18:07.454 --> 18:08.464
this is gonna be
a lot harder than I thought.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.221
How about...

18:10.256 --> 18:11.589
How about Elizabeth?

18:11.624 --> 18:13.091
Elizabeth.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.892
It's nice to meet you.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.368
Pleased to meet you, too,
Dr. Callan.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.466
Take your time.

18:31.377 --> 18:32.977
Not only
do I feel strange,

18:33.012 --> 18:35.046
but now I look
strange as well.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.448
I promise I won't tell
my nurse you said that.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.028
Oh, right, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to imply...

18:39.052 --> 18:40.985
I'm kidding,
sorry, I was kidding.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.220
There was a reason

18:42.255 --> 18:43.365
I wanted to bring you
into town

18:43.389 --> 18:44.722
so soon after
your injury, though.

18:44.757 --> 18:46.190
The quicker that
we can expose you

18:46.226 --> 18:47.525
to images
you may recognize,

18:47.560 --> 18:49.527
the faster your memory
will return.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.895
So, what do you think?

18:50.930 --> 18:51.829
Look around,
what do you see?

18:51.865 --> 18:53.531
Does anything
ring a bell?

18:53.566 --> 18:56.234
Uh, I see
a post office.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.302
A gazebo.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.037
A banner that says
"Fall Fest,"

19:00.073 --> 19:01.183
but nothing's
ringing a bell.

19:01.207 --> 19:04.208
Okay, stop for a sec,

19:04.244 --> 19:05.343
take a deep breath.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.712
Close your eyes.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.014
What do you smell?

19:10.049 --> 19:14.685
I think I smell apple pie,

19:14.721 --> 19:16.821
cinnamon,

19:16.856 --> 19:19.891
and... a fire

19:19.926 --> 19:21.125
burning off in the distance.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.395
That's...

19:23.429 --> 19:25.997
that's good.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.498
Does that remind you
of anything?

19:27.534 --> 19:29.333
Yeah. My mother.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.502
I don't remember much,

19:31.538 --> 19:34.705
but I know she used to
bake pies this time of year.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.474
That's good.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.210
You feel better?

19:39.245 --> 19:40.111
Yeah, a little.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.045
Thanks.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.380
You bet.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.415
Hey, Jimmy!

19:43.449 --> 19:44.549
You need a hand
with that?

19:44.584 --> 19:45.716
Oh, nah,

19:45.752 --> 19:47.062
this is about as close as I get
to the gym these days.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.020
Hey there.

19:49.055 --> 19:49.954
Jimmy Daniels.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.088
I'd shake your hand,

19:51.124 --> 19:53.524
but I'm afraid these boxes
wouldn't survive the fall.

19:53.560 --> 19:54.592
[chuckles]

19:54.627 --> 19:55.738
Nice to meet you.
My name is...

19:55.762 --> 19:56.727
Elizabeth.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.628
Elizabeth, right.

19:57.664 --> 19:58.863
Uh...

19:58.898 --> 20:00.198
Is this your store?

20:00.233 --> 20:01.532
Sure is.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.711
The Bookery has been
in my family

20:02.735 --> 20:04.268
for over 70 years.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.070
Wanna come in, look around?

20:06.105 --> 20:07.283
Know what, we're just
gonna head to the diner,

20:07.307 --> 20:08.206
but we'll come back after.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.209
Ah, well, feel free
to drop by anytime.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.376
Good to meet you,
Elizabeth.

20:12.412 --> 20:13.412
Nice to meet you.

20:14.147 --> 20:16.781
Everybody seems
so friendly around here.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.417
That's small-town
living for you.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.953
It's nice.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.221
It is.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.592
Can I get you a coffee?

20:27.627 --> 20:30.261
You're really comfortable
around here, huh?

20:30.296 --> 20:31.128
First job I ever had

20:31.164 --> 20:33.064
was right here
at my parents' diner.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.665
Actually, that gazebo
you saw earlier,

20:34.701 --> 20:36.267
that's where
they got married.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.368
The post office you saw,

20:37.403 --> 20:40.605
that's where I found out
I got into medical school.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.405
Yeah, you can say

20:41.441 --> 20:43.407
I know my way
around this place.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.709
Come sit down.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.144
Let's sit here.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.315
You can get some food
if you want.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.783
Hi, honey.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.253
Oh, hello.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.254
Make yourselves
comfortable.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.322
Elizabeth, these are
my parents, Bob and Jane.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.323
This is Elizabeth.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.758
Uh, hi.
How are you?

21:00.793 --> 21:01.759
Hi, sweetheart.

21:01.794 --> 21:02.760
So where are you from?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.762
Oh, actually,
your son and I

21:04.797 --> 21:06.664
are both trying to figure
that out right now.

21:06.699 --> 21:07.665
Yeah, Elizabeth
is having

21:07.700 --> 21:08.499
a little trouble
with her memory.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.534
Sheriff Gaines found her
walking alone

21:10.570 --> 21:11.814
on the highway this morning,
all by herself.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.449
And you can't remember
anything before that?

21:13.473 --> 21:14.839
Nope.

21:14.874 --> 21:15.406
So, where are you
planning to stay

21:15.441 --> 21:16.774
while you're in town?

21:16.809 --> 21:20.211
Oh, I hadn't even
thought about that.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.446
Is there a hotel
or something nearby?

21:22.482 --> 21:24.482
Oh, I'm afraid our hotel
is full of tourists

21:24.517 --> 21:25.517
this time of year.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.020
But don't be silly,
you can stay with Jeff.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.988
- She can?
- Sure.

21:31.024 --> 21:32.067
You've got that
beautiful guest house

21:32.091 --> 21:33.457
that never gets used.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.358
Oh, no, I wouldn't
want to impose on you

21:34.394 --> 21:35.693
and on your family.

21:35.728 --> 21:36.994
It's just Jeff
and the kids.

21:37.030 --> 21:38.462
It's no trouble
at all.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.463
No.

21:39.499 --> 21:40.564
You know what,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.033
that's probably
not such a bad idea.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.068
A head injury,
you know,

21:43.102 --> 21:44.035
I can keep
my eye on you.

21:44.070 --> 21:48.506
As long as it's not
an imposition, then sure.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.808
[cell phone ringing]

21:53.613 --> 21:55.813
[cell phone ringing]

21:58.217 --> 21:59.684
Sorry about this,

21:59.719 --> 22:00.996
the kids were supposed
to be here by now.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.820
Oh, that's okay.
I don't mind waiting.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.188
Hi, Dad.

22:04.223 --> 22:05.423
Hey, guys.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.324
Where have you been?

22:06.359 --> 22:07.591
Fishing on the dock.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.593
I caught four,
all by myself.

22:09.629 --> 22:10.995
That's impressive, Alex,

22:11.030 --> 22:12.574
but that's not an excuse
for being late, right?

22:12.598 --> 22:14.332
Uh, Dad, you do know

22:14.367 --> 22:16.067
there's a woman
sitting in our truck.

22:17.770 --> 22:18.736
Don't mind him.

22:18.771 --> 22:19.837
Hi, I'm Emily.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.272
Do you work with my Dad?

22:21.307 --> 22:22.106
Guys, this is
Elizabeth, all right?

22:22.141 --> 22:23.841
She's a patient of mine,

22:23.876 --> 22:24.742
she's going to be
staying with us

22:24.777 --> 22:25.710
for a little while.

22:25.745 --> 22:26.644
In our house?

22:26.679 --> 22:29.046
Well, she's gonna be
in the guest house.

22:29.082 --> 22:30.959
She's having a difficult time
remembering some things,

22:30.983 --> 22:34.018
and we are going
to help her.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.753
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.757
[Emily]: So, you lost
your memory?

22:39.792 --> 22:41.392
That's incredible.

22:41.427 --> 22:42.893
Well, I'll tell you what,

22:42.929 --> 22:44.729
it doesn't feel
very incredible right now.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.698
Emily, how was your day?

22:47.734 --> 22:49.400
Pretty good.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.869
I got picked to write
a one-act play for Fall Fest.

22:51.904 --> 22:52.703
It's not a big deal.

22:52.739 --> 22:53.804
What?

22:53.840 --> 22:54.772
Come on, are you kidding me?

22:54.807 --> 22:56.040
That's a huge deal.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.808
Congrats, honey.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.077
Fall Fest is all-day
celebration of the season.

23:00.113 --> 23:00.945
We have it every year

23:00.980 --> 23:02.380
to raise money
for the kids' school.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.315
It's pretty awesome.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.951
There's games,
every kind of food imaginable.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.487
And there's a really cool
ferris wheel.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.287
Wow, that
sounds great.

23:10.323 --> 23:12.123
Favorite day
of the fall, right kids?

23:12.158 --> 23:13.057
[together]: Yup.

23:13.092 --> 23:13.858
And you got picked

23:13.893 --> 23:15.760
to put up a play
for the entire town?

23:15.795 --> 23:16.660
Yeah, but I'm worried

23:16.696 --> 23:18.662
since I only have
two weeks to write it.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.409
Well, I'm sure you'll
rise up to the challenge.

23:20.433 --> 23:21.899
You should come

23:21.934 --> 23:23.112
if you're still here
for Fall Fest.

23:23.136 --> 23:24.168
Honey,

23:24.203 --> 23:25.302
that's 12 days from now.

23:25.338 --> 23:28.739
Yeah, I mean, as much as
I would love to see your play,

23:28.775 --> 23:29.607
I'm pretty sure my memory
will have be back,

23:29.642 --> 23:30.574
and I'll be home.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.076
Okay.

23:36.282 --> 23:37.481
[♪♪♪]

23:37.517 --> 23:39.383
Home sweet home.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.688
I'm gonna go
empty the dishwasher.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.158
I'm gonna go
clean my room.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.426
[Jeff]: Okay.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.163
I thought kids were supposed
to hate doing their chores.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.297
Oh, don't be fooled.

23:53.332 --> 23:55.633
They're only doing it
to get today's Wi-Fi password.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.135
I change it every day

23:58.171 --> 24:00.671
and give it to them
once they finish their chores.

24:00.706 --> 24:03.007
Wow, that seems brilliant
and disturbing

24:03.042 --> 24:05.109
all at the same time.

24:11.517 --> 24:14.218
Yeah, it's not easy raising
two kids on your own, so...

24:14.253 --> 24:16.520
I hope Alex wasn't
bothering you

24:16.556 --> 24:17.721
with his
third degree earlier.

24:17.757 --> 24:18.789
Oh, no, of course not.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.459
I mean, I'm a strange woman
in hospital scrubs.

24:21.494 --> 24:24.395
I'd be curious, too.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.630
Yeah, their mom
passed away

24:26.666 --> 24:27.531
a few years ago,

24:27.567 --> 24:30.301
so he gets a little
overprotective of me.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.471
Yeah, of course.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.372
That makes sense.

24:35.408 --> 24:36.674
I'm sorry about your wife.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.375
Thanks.

24:39.445 --> 24:40.711
Here, let me show you around.

24:42.281 --> 24:45.015
Wait, hold on
a second.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.984
What is this?

24:47.019 --> 24:48.019
Oh...

24:50.756 --> 24:52.156
You have a canoe?

24:52.191 --> 24:53.524
I do.

24:53.559 --> 24:55.192
It used to be my grandfather's.

24:55.228 --> 24:57.661
Unfortunately, I've neglected
her over the years, though.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.763
I don't understand,

24:59.799 --> 25:02.600
your kids do their chores
when they're supposed to.

25:02.635 --> 25:05.069
Your property seems
meticulously organized,

25:05.104 --> 25:06.270
and yet you have

25:06.305 --> 25:09.773
this amazing 1930
Sullivan Model D

25:09.809 --> 25:11.742
just sitting here
in disrepair?

25:11.777 --> 25:14.578
How do you know so much
about canoes?

25:15.815 --> 25:16.914
Oh.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.182
You know what, I...

25:18.217 --> 25:20.417
I have no idea.

25:20.453 --> 25:21.730
That's probably
a good sign, right?

25:21.754 --> 25:22.553
It is a good sign.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.554
It'd be a great sign

25:23.589 --> 25:24.967
if you could connect it
to actual memories.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.191
But if you continue
to have those,

25:27.226 --> 25:28.893
your memory will be back
in no time.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.762
Okay, well, at least
I'm starting

25:31.797 --> 25:33.097
with the really
important stuff,

25:33.132 --> 25:34.532
like old canoes.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.200
[laughs]

25:36.235 --> 25:37.134
Come on, let me
show you around.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.202
Okay.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.054
Sorry if it's a little
dusty in here.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.412
We don't get many guests, but...

25:48.447 --> 25:50.281
No, it's lovely.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.448
Thank you.

25:53.019 --> 25:55.152
I think I can take it
from here, Dad.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.855
Okay, great,
she's all yours.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.103
You know, you can join us
for dinner tonight,

26:01.127 --> 26:04.528
or if you're too tired,
you can just go to sleep.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.265
Wow, he's even weirder
than usual.

26:08.301 --> 26:09.341
It's nice having you here.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.101
The only other girl
that comes over

26:11.137 --> 26:11.969
is my Aunt Linda,

26:12.004 --> 26:13.671
but she always tries
to take me shopping

26:13.706 --> 26:15.339
for dresses and makeup,

26:15.374 --> 26:17.675
and I don't really care
about that stuff.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.577
What kind of stuff
are you into?

26:19.612 --> 26:20.778
I love books.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.279
Fiction mostly.

26:22.315 --> 26:23.325
Oh, so you must spend
a lot of time

26:23.349 --> 26:24.426
in that bookstore
I saw in town.

26:24.450 --> 26:25.583
Are you kidding,

26:25.618 --> 26:27.351
it's like one of
my favorite places.

26:27.386 --> 26:28.530
Maybe we can go
before you leave.

26:28.554 --> 26:29.620
Yeah.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.755
Yeah, that'd be great.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.759
Okay, that's my cue.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.194
See you in the morning.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.629
Thank you.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.333
Bye.

26:57.817 --> 27:01.485

27:01.520 --> 27:04.755

27:08.427 --> 27:10.661
<i>You have almost reached
Angela Young.</i>

27:10.696 --> 27:12.074
<i>Please leave a message,
and I will call you back.</i>

27:12.098 --> 27:13.408
Cynthia, that's,
like, the fifth time

27:13.432 --> 27:14.298
you've tried calling her

27:14.333 --> 27:14.932
since she left town
a couple days ago.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.200
Aren't you
the one who said

27:16.235 --> 27:17.235
she'd contact us

27:17.269 --> 27:18.235
when she's ready
to come home

27:18.270 --> 27:19.670
like she always does?

27:19.705 --> 27:20.537
No, you're right.

27:20.573 --> 27:22.339
I just wanted
to make sure she's okay.

27:22.375 --> 27:25.309
I still can't believe
she decided to take a vacation

27:25.344 --> 27:26.655
the day before
the movie premiere.

27:26.679 --> 27:27.711
You know Angela.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.424
That's what she does
when she gets stressed out.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.048
But look
on the bright-side,

27:31.083 --> 27:32.494
you can always look forward
to attending the sequel

27:32.518 --> 27:33.317
in a couple years.

27:33.352 --> 27:36.186
Well, I do like
the sound of that.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.522
So, where do you think
she went this time?

27:38.557 --> 27:40.324
Ooh, if I had to guess,

27:40.359 --> 27:42.359
I'd say she's hiding out
at some spa resort

27:42.395 --> 27:43.527
on the Cape somewhere.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.674
You know, anything to forget
her real life for a while.

27:45.698 --> 27:47.098
Well, it's a good thing
she's got us

27:47.133 --> 27:48.499
to keep her real life going.

27:50.936 --> 27:51.869
Are you sure
I can't help?

27:51.904 --> 27:53.103
Nope.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.449
I think I got it
all covered here,

27:54.473 --> 27:56.840
so you go ahead
and sit down, all right?

28:02.448 --> 28:04.915
Hey, Elizabeth, would you like
to play a game later?

28:04.950 --> 28:06.061
We have a whole
closet of 'em.

28:06.085 --> 28:07.551
Dad has to go

28:07.586 --> 28:08.552
to a Town Hall meeting,

28:08.587 --> 28:10.054
so he can't play with us.

28:10.089 --> 28:13.257
You guys, Elizabeth has had
a rough couple days,

28:13.292 --> 28:15.859
so we are going to let her
get some rest, okay?

28:15.895 --> 28:18.228
Actually, you'd be amazed
what 10 hours of sleep

28:18.264 --> 28:19.296
can do for you.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.098
Okay, well, that's
good to hear.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.901
All right, pancakes!

28:23.936 --> 28:25.602
This is one of
my favorite dishes, right?

28:25.638 --> 28:26.904
Dad, isn't this

28:26.939 --> 28:29.073
the only dish
you know how to cook?

28:29.108 --> 28:30.441
Okay, come on, you guys.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.276
I'm sure I'll love it.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.577
I'm starving.

28:33.612 --> 28:34.645
Can I eat three?

28:34.680 --> 28:35.913
Elizabeth gets
first serving.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.614
She's our guest.

28:37.650 --> 28:40.284
- [Jeff]: That's right.
- [Elizabeth]: Thank you, Emily.

28:40.319 --> 28:41.963
Are you going to wear
the same hospital clothes

28:41.987 --> 28:43.654
the entire time?

28:43.689 --> 28:45.422
There called scrubs,
right, Dad?

28:45.458 --> 28:46.423
Yes, they are.

28:46.459 --> 28:47.524
I promise,

28:47.560 --> 28:49.720
I'm going to get new clothes
the minute I get a chance.

28:50.796 --> 28:52.963
You know something,

28:52.998 --> 28:55.899
I'd really like to join you
to that Town Hall meeting,

28:55.935 --> 28:57.067
if that's okay.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.969
Uh, okay,
I mean, I was thinking

28:59.004 --> 29:00.449
you might need a little
more rest today, though.

29:00.473 --> 29:01.905
Oh, any more rest,

29:01.941 --> 29:03.540
and I'll never get out
of that bed.

29:09.548 --> 29:10.748
Now, last thing,

29:10.783 --> 29:13.383
the pumpkin-carving
competition.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.430
We still need volunteers
for registration and judging.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.420
Sign me up,

29:16.455 --> 29:17.521
and Bob, too.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.623
I thought we were taking it
easy this year, Janie.

29:19.658 --> 29:21.258
When you rest,
you rust.

29:21.293 --> 29:22.126
[laughter]

29:22.161 --> 29:23.894
Your mom's
a real spitfire.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.195
You have no idea.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.930
Okay, shifting
to new business...

29:26.966 --> 29:28.398
Jeffrey,
why don't you start?

29:28.434 --> 29:30.868
Yeah, thank you.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.269
Hey, everyone,

29:32.304 --> 29:33.815
I'm sure most of you
have heard by now,

29:33.839 --> 29:36.039
that we have
a new visitor in town.

29:36.075 --> 29:39.243
I'd like you to say hello
to Elizabeth, please.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.045
[applause]

29:42.081 --> 29:44.047
Now, she's having some
trouble with her memory.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.293
We hope it's going
to come back soon,

29:45.317 --> 29:46.895
but in the meantime,
Sheriff Gaines and I

29:46.919 --> 29:48.786
were hoping
that everybody here

29:48.821 --> 29:49.898
could help us cast
a wider net.

29:49.922 --> 29:50.922
That's right.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.634
I've been in touch with
the other departments

29:52.658 --> 29:53.323
from the surrounding area,

29:53.359 --> 29:55.392
but nothing's
come up yet.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.060
Which is where
you guys come in.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.997
I have a couple thousand
Instagram followers.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.065
We could post a pic

30:02.101 --> 30:03.400
and see if anyone
recognizes her?

30:03.435 --> 30:05.302
That's a great idea, Wendy,
let's do that.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.971
Here, Elizabeth,
let me take a photo.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.149
Yeah.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.684
Yeah, I think so.

30:20.719 --> 30:21.652
Why don't you sit down?

30:21.687 --> 30:22.931
You know, uh, maybe
that's enough for now.

30:22.955 --> 30:24.121
Okay, thanks.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.489
Thanks, Wendy.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.548

since I was a kid.

30:39.572 --> 30:41.705
Well then, you're
seriously missing out.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.040
Wanna try?

30:43.075 --> 30:44.942
Sure.

this was a competition.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.710
Nothing I'm doing is helping me
bring my memory back.

31:19.745 --> 31:21.423
You know, I was doing
some research this morning,

31:21.447 --> 31:22.858
and apparently some people
find it helpful

31:22.882 --> 31:24.848
to write down their experiences.

31:24.884 --> 31:27.150
It helps them kind of
jog their memories.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.685
Anyway, I, uh...

31:30.389 --> 31:31.389
I brought you this.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.492
A journal?

31:36.562 --> 31:37.527
Thank you.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.162
You're welcome.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.431
You know, I also just wanted
to check your vitals

31:46.038 --> 31:46.870
Just look at me
for a sec?

31:46.906 --> 31:48.705
Okay.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.440
- Does that hurt at all?
- No.

31:50.476 --> 31:51.675
No.

31:51.710 --> 31:52.710
Okay.

31:52.745 --> 31:53.610
Let me see your hand for a sec.

31:53.646 --> 31:55.212
Just give me your wrist.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.684
Heart rate is a little fast,

32:00.719 --> 32:02.753
but that should normalize
by morning.

32:02.788 --> 32:04.855
I'm just going to check
your eyes here, okay?

32:08.260 --> 32:10.694
Okay, looks great.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.197
I mean, yeah,
everything looks good.

32:17.136 --> 32:21.104
So, you just relax,
enjoy your time,

32:21.140 --> 32:22.417
and I'll check you out again
in the morning, okay?

32:22.441 --> 32:24.174

33:32.144 --> 33:33.844
sorry I'm late,
I had to change.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.879
- Did I miss breakfast?
- Good morning.

33:35.914 --> 33:36.847
No, I left you
a plate right there

33:36.882 --> 33:38.382
on top of the stove.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.527
Don't worry about being late.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.162
I'm definitely not a stickler
about time, right, kids?

33:41.186 --> 33:42.152
[kids laughing]

33:42.187 --> 33:43.020
Yeah, right, Dad!

33:43.055 --> 33:44.388
No comment.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.533
So, any luck
with your memory

33:45.557 --> 33:47.124
this morning?

33:47.159 --> 33:48.959
Uh, no, not yet.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.527
Apparently,
my brain's late, too.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.962
[chuckling]

33:51.997 --> 33:53.508
So, listen, we're going
to head into town.

33:53.532 --> 33:54.364
Emily's gonna go
to the library

33:54.400 --> 33:55.599
to work on her play,

33:55.634 --> 33:57.445
and Alex is going to go hang out
with my parents at the diner.

33:57.469 --> 33:58.335
Do you want to...

33:58.370 --> 33:59.469
catch a ride in with us?

33:59.505 --> 34:01.625
It's probably better than
hanging around here all day.

34:01.974 --> 34:03.373
Um...

34:03.409 --> 34:05.842
Yeah, sure. Why not?

34:05.878 --> 34:07.244
[♪♪♪]

34:08.847 --> 34:09.946
Bye, Dad.

34:09.982 --> 34:11.359
We'll meet you
at the diner at 5:00.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.815
Okay, sounds good.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.329
You make sure you get Alex
to Nana's, right?

34:14.353 --> 34:15.217
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

34:15.254 --> 34:16.319
Bye.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.154
Are you sure you're going
to be okay by yourself?

34:17.188 --> 34:18.789
You're more than welcome
to come down,

34:18.824 --> 34:19.489
hang out at the office
if you want.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.456
Uh, no, thanks,

34:20.492 --> 34:22.070
I think I'm going to head
over to the library

34:22.094 --> 34:23.460
and do some more research,

34:23.495 --> 34:24.728
see what comes to me.

34:24.763 --> 34:25.862
Okay.

34:25.898 --> 34:28.165
You know, just
so you know, uh,

34:28.199 --> 34:29.132
Kevin, the sheriff
you met yesterday,

34:29.168 --> 34:31.001
he's doing all that he can
for you as well.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.202
I know.

34:32.237 --> 34:33.003
I just, I could
barely sleep last night,

34:33.038 --> 34:33.804
thinking about

34:33.839 --> 34:35.216
how there could be
somebody out there

34:35.239 --> 34:37.206
looking for me
as we speak.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.041
I completely
understand.

34:38.077 --> 34:40.342
Then again, I could
also be a recluse

34:40.379 --> 34:41.844
that lives alone
somewhere.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.179
Oh, I doubt that.

34:43.215 --> 34:44.748
Either way, I just...

34:44.783 --> 34:46.382
I feel like
I need to do something.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.652
Okay, well, good luck,

34:48.687 --> 34:49.898
and if you need to pick up
anything afterwards,

34:49.922 --> 34:51.199
you can find them
on these two blocks.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.400
You've got my office
down there

34:52.424 --> 34:54.024
a thrift store,

34:54.059 --> 34:55.425
farmer's market.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.525
Great, okay,

34:56.562 --> 34:57.394
well, I'll take it
from here.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.429
Okay, sounds good.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.699
Oh, except, uh...

35:02.734 --> 35:03.934
I don't have any money.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.268
I'm sorry.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.937
I swear, I'll pay you back.

35:06.972 --> 35:09.873
You know what,
don't even worry about it.

35:09.908 --> 35:10.707
There you go.

35:10.742 --> 35:11.641
Thanks.

35:11.677 --> 35:12.576
Hey, you never know,
maybe I'll find out

35:12.611 --> 35:15.178
that I'm an heiress
to a great fortune.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.125
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say probably not.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.748
- You never know.
- No, it's true.

35:18.784 --> 35:19.784
You know what,

35:19.818 --> 35:21.463
I don't care if you even
have a dime to your name,

35:21.487 --> 35:22.764
I just want to make sure
you get home safe.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.054
Amen to that.

35:24.089 --> 35:25.188
Okay, I'll see you later.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.224
Bye.

35:40.105 --> 35:41.571
[sighs in frustration]

35:46.078 --> 35:47.110
Hey...

35:48.180 --> 35:50.380
you're the woman who lost
her memory, aren't you?

35:50.415 --> 35:51.548
Yeah.

35:51.583 --> 35:52.816
Yes...

35:52.851 --> 35:54.918
Word travels fast around here.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.220
Oh, I actually
took your photo at Town Hall.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.321
Oh, right.

35:58.357 --> 35:59.389
Hi!

35:59.424 --> 36:00.424
I'm Wendy.

36:00.459 --> 36:01.324
I'm... Elizabeth.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.459
Hi.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.729
Is there anything
I can do to help?

36:05.764 --> 36:06.830
Oh, you're sweet.

36:06.865 --> 36:10.734
I, um, I've been online
for hours,

36:10.769 --> 36:13.637
but I think I've officially
run out of things to search for.

36:13.672 --> 36:17.073
Yeah, how can you
search for yourself

36:17.109 --> 36:18.475
when you don't even know
your name

36:18.510 --> 36:20.143
or where you came from?

36:20.179 --> 36:22.612
Yeah, exactly.

36:22.648 --> 36:24.080
I think I just need
a little break.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.350
What are you working on?

36:27.386 --> 36:29.452
I'm starting college
in the fall,

36:29.488 --> 36:31.955
so I have to fill out
all these housing forms online.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.256
Oh, that's great.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.424
What school?

36:34.459 --> 36:35.325
Emerson,

36:35.360 --> 36:36.626
for Communications.

36:38.497 --> 36:41.398
The campus is literally
in the heart of Boston.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.770
In Boston...

36:46.805 --> 36:47.805
Everything okay?

36:47.839 --> 36:49.139
[sounds swirl dreamily]

36:49.174 --> 36:50.340
<i>- Hi!
- Yeah.</i>

36:51.643 --> 36:52.643
Yeah.

36:52.678 --> 36:53.877
Yeah, I, uh...

36:53.912 --> 36:56.646
I just realized
I have to be somewhere.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.480
Good luck with school.

36:57.516 --> 36:58.949
Thanks.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.658
[knocks]

37:08.694 --> 37:10.060
Hey!

37:10.095 --> 37:12.662
Uh, any news on Elizabeth?

37:12.698 --> 37:14.464
Not yet.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.366
I sent her DNA
to the lab in Concord,

37:16.401 --> 37:17.512
but that won't be ready
for a week.

37:17.536 --> 37:18.702
Hmm.

37:18.737 --> 37:19.981
It doesn't make
any sense, does it?

37:20.005 --> 37:21.916
She's been missing four days,
and no one's looking for her?

37:21.940 --> 37:23.418
Well, there could be
a bunch of reasons.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.874
Maybe she lives alone.

37:24.910 --> 37:25.987
Yeah, no, I was
thinking about that,

37:26.011 --> 37:27.043
but then, you know,

37:27.079 --> 37:28.856
what about like, family,
or friends, or co-workers?

37:28.880 --> 37:30.680
Well, it's anybody's guess
at this point.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.915
Let's just give it
some time.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.584
Yeah, I guess
that makes sense.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.820
I'm just, you know,
trying to figure it out.

37:36.855 --> 37:37.855
Yeah.

37:37.889 --> 37:38.889
I noticed.

37:44.196 --> 37:45.996
[♪♪♪]

37:46.031 --> 37:46.997
Hey, Emily.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.164
How's it going?

37:48.200 --> 37:49.599
Not that great.

37:49.635 --> 37:50.567
I can't seem to figure out

37:50.602 --> 37:53.603
how to turn my story
into a play for Fall Fest.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.538
Oh, well, maybe I can help.

37:55.574 --> 37:56.606
What's it about?

37:56.642 --> 37:59.242
Well, it's set in a school,

37:59.278 --> 38:02.912
and the lead is a popular
13-year-old girl named Erin

38:02.948 --> 38:04.381
who loses a pair
of concert tickets

38:04.416 --> 38:05.448
for a show that evening.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.550
In order
to find the tickets,

38:07.586 --> 38:08.952
she has no choice

38:08.987 --> 38:10.698
but to ask for the help
of several classmates

38:10.722 --> 38:12.200
who she's never even
talked to before.

38:12.224 --> 38:14.624
She doesn't end up
finding the tickets,

38:14.660 --> 38:16.437
but she does end up
with two new best friends.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.361
I like it.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.297
So she ends up gaining
more than she loses.

38:20.332 --> 38:21.564
Huh?

38:21.600 --> 38:22.666
Well, in other words,

38:22.701 --> 38:24.701
the concert would have only
lasted her one night,

38:24.736 --> 38:26.569
but the friendships
could end up

38:26.605 --> 38:28.538
lasting her a lifetime.

38:28.573 --> 38:29.472
Oh...

38:29.508 --> 38:30.540
Yes.

38:30.575 --> 38:32.142
That's it.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.411
So, in order
to set up the story,

38:34.446 --> 38:36.313
you can have a scene

38:36.348 --> 38:39.149
where you show Erin
and her popular friends

38:39.184 --> 38:40.984
not speaking so kindly

38:41.019 --> 38:43.953
about the two students
who end up helping her.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.100
That way we can quickly explain
where all the characters stand.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.457
And at the end,

38:47.492 --> 38:48.291
they could maybe have a scene

38:48.327 --> 38:49.959
where Erin defends
her new friends

38:49.995 --> 38:50.860
from the popular ones.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.595
I think you might be
a natural at this.

38:52.631 --> 38:53.663
And who knows,

38:53.699 --> 38:55.143
you might be a theatre teacher
in your real life.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.132
Hmm.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.668
Well, I'm actually headed
to the thrift shop,

38:58.704 --> 38:59.669
for a new wardrobe,

38:59.705 --> 39:02.505
so I'm really hoping
I'm a fashion designer.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.985
Do you wanna come with me
in case I'm wrong?

39:04.009 --> 39:04.808
Sure, that'd be fun.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.943
[♪♪♪]

39:14.486 --> 39:16.286
Uh-huh, that's... different.

39:16.321 --> 39:18.988
Emily, you're allowed
to speak your mind.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.368
I promise, you won't
hurt my feelings.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.692
I know, but I want you
to buy what you like.

39:22.728 --> 39:23.805
You're the one
who's gonna be wearing it.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.829
That's a good point.

39:25.864 --> 39:26.874
But I still want your opinion.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.932
What, I don't get
an opinion?

39:28.967 --> 39:30.333
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

39:30.369 --> 39:31.369
Hello, Dr. Callan,

39:31.403 --> 39:32.769
Are you
checking up on us?

39:32.804 --> 39:34.382
I just finished work
at the clinic early,

39:34.406 --> 39:35.950
was just walking by,
saw you girls in the window,

39:35.974 --> 39:37.140
and thought,

39:37.175 --> 39:38.986
you know, since I have such
an amazing sense of style...

39:39.010 --> 39:41.211
Yeah, right, Dad.

39:41.246 --> 39:42.112
What?

39:42.147 --> 39:43.147
Something tells me

39:43.181 --> 39:44.892
you're stretching the truth
there, Dr. Callan.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.015
Maybe just a little.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.217
Well, good,
since you're here,

39:47.252 --> 39:48.852
we're going
to put you to work,

39:48.887 --> 39:51.254
maybe you can help us decide
what my new wardrobe should be.

39:52.657 --> 39:54.124
Great. Okay.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.359
Oh, look at this,

39:56.395 --> 39:57.894
how about that?

39:57.929 --> 39:58.929
Dad, are you kidding?

39:58.964 --> 40:00.864
Elizabeth would never wear
something like that.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.866
Yeah, Emily's right.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.234
I don't know
what my identity is,

40:04.269 --> 40:05.835
but it doesn't involve
that suit.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.303
Right.

40:07.339 --> 40:09.973
Okay, well, how about
the three of us split up,

40:10.008 --> 40:11.307
and meet back
at the change rooms

40:11.343 --> 40:12.675
in, like, 10 minutes?

40:12.711 --> 40:13.977
Okay, sounds like a plan.

40:14.012 --> 40:14.811
Sounds good.

40:14.846 --> 40:15.846
Good.

40:31.596 --> 40:32.596
Or, actually,
you know,

40:32.631 --> 40:34.063
maybe it's
a little too much.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.265
[laughing]

40:35.300 --> 40:36.900
Oh, that's nice,
but it is pretty shiny.

40:36.935 --> 40:38.034
Yeah, I don't
think so.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.402
[♪♪♪]

40:39.438 --> 40:41.604
I think this is it.

Wow, it's, uh...

40:46.044 --> 40:48.144
it-it looks really good.

40:49.815 --> 40:50.880
It's nice.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.384
Okay.

40:59.257 --> 41:00.590
What's for dinner?

41:00.625 --> 41:01.724
Meatloaf from the diner.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.293
Nana's secret recipe.

41:03.328 --> 41:06.129
It's not really
a secret, Dad.

41:06.164 --> 41:09.232
Nana tells everyone

it smells delicious.

Alex, bud, can you turn
the TV off for me, please?

41:16.675 --> 41:18.208
Oh, no worries, I got it.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.309
Okay, thank you.

41:19.344 --> 41:20.655
Did you guys put
the utensils out?

41:40.265 --> 41:43.600
I think I just had a memory
from my real life,

41:43.635 --> 41:46.736
but I don't know
how to connect the dots.

41:46.771 --> 41:48.805
Okay, you're putting
so much pressure on yourself

41:48.840 --> 41:51.908
without realizing that
you've been through a trauma.

41:51.943 --> 41:53.243
So, what do I do?

41:53.278 --> 41:54.511
My suggestion is,

41:54.546 --> 41:56.179
you stop trying so hard
to remember,

41:56.214 --> 41:58.281
and trust that
it will all come back to you.

the arc again?

the emotional journey

42:49.668 --> 42:51.234

Yeah, it's a surprise
for your dad.

44:44.382 --> 44:46.182
All she needs
is some oil, some varnish,

44:46.217 --> 44:48.751
and a few holes patched.

44:48.787 --> 44:50.953
Sounds like a lot
of work to me.

44:50.989 --> 44:51.954
Well, it won't be easy,

44:51.990 --> 44:53.089
but if we work together,

44:53.124 --> 44:55.491
we can get this done in no time.

to your video game?

any communication.

She has never gone this long
without talking to me.

Wait, aren't you the one
who said, "Stop worrying, Brad,

45:58.690 --> 45:59.970
she just needs some time alone"?

to the police.

calm down, she's fine, okay?

And actually,

we're getting a lot
more work done without her.

46:07.532 --> 46:09.065
I'm sorry, but I cannot
keep pretending

46:09.100 --> 46:10.333
like it's business as usual.

46:10.368 --> 46:11.200
Okay, I hear you.

46:11.236 --> 46:12.535
I hear you.

46:12.570 --> 46:13.581
How about this, how about,

in the next 48 hours,

46:15.540 --> 46:16.272
we go the police?

46:16.307 --> 46:17.907
But until then,
let's just assume

46:17.942 --> 46:20.943
that she's at
a relaxation spa somewhere,

46:20.979 --> 46:23.746
getting a seaweed wrap
or something.

46:23.782 --> 46:26.215
[sanders grinding and rasping]

46:37.295 --> 46:38.161
So I'm curious,

46:38.196 --> 46:40.062
why did you guys stop
using the canoe?

46:40.098 --> 46:42.064
I remember
my dad and mom

46:42.100 --> 46:43.466
used to take it
out on the water

46:43.501 --> 46:44.501
to watch the sunsets.

46:45.770 --> 46:48.137
Maybe it just reminds him of her
too much.

46:48.173 --> 46:49.383
That must have been
a really tough time

46:49.407 --> 46:50.473
for everybody.

46:50.508 --> 46:52.875
Yeah, our Nana and Grandpa
stayed a lot back then,

46:52.911 --> 46:55.878
and I remember we made
lots of cookies.

46:55.914 --> 46:57.814
Well, hopefully this
surprise will do the trick.

46:57.849 --> 46:59.415
Yeah, he's gonna love it!

46:59.450 --> 47:00.995
Well, we've been
working on it for three days,

developments

but it turned out to be
someone else.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.135
Hmm.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.937
But for now,
you and the kids

47:20.972 --> 47:21.904
like having her
at the house, right?

47:21.940 --> 47:22.805
Yeah.

47:22.841 --> 47:25.374
No, she's been great.

47:25.410 --> 47:26.242
This morning,

47:26.277 --> 47:27.588
she was helping Emily
with her play,

47:27.612 --> 47:28.444
and Alex, well,

47:28.479 --> 47:29.912
Alex hasn't put her
in a closet yet,

47:29.948 --> 47:30.880
so that's
a good thing, right?

47:30.915 --> 47:32.315
[laughs]

47:32.350 --> 47:35.318
Yeah. Yeah, I'd say
that's progress.

47:35.353 --> 47:37.787
I tell you though, man,
it's crazy

47:37.822 --> 47:38.866
ever since she's been
staying with us,

47:38.890 --> 47:41.123
it's like we're just...
happier than we've been

47:41.159 --> 47:42.258
in a long time, you know?

47:42.293 --> 47:44.460
What's so crazy about that?

47:44.495 --> 47:45.261
That's a good thing.

47:45.296 --> 47:46.729
I know.

47:46.764 --> 47:47.830
That's the problem.

47:47.866 --> 47:48.831
I worry about the kids,

47:48.867 --> 47:52.001
you know, when she eventually
has to leave.

47:52.036 --> 47:53.769
Jeff, you and I go way back.

47:53.805 --> 47:55.304
Take my advice.

47:55.340 --> 47:57.106
Don't worry about it so much.

47:57.141 --> 47:59.442
Just enjoy the time
you do have with her.

47:59.477 --> 48:01.410
You're right, you're right.

48:01.446 --> 48:03.579
And besides, right,

48:03.615 --> 48:04.925
she's got some friends
and family out there

48:04.949 --> 48:06.449
that are looking for her
right now,

48:06.484 --> 48:07.416
and that's a good thing, so...

48:07.452 --> 48:08.417
Yeah.

Thanks, buddy.

Don't look...

[Jeff]: This is a little
dramatic, don't you think?

48:15.360 --> 48:16.592
[Angela]: Are you kidding?

48:16.628 --> 48:19.039
It is not nearly dramatic enough
for what you're about to see.

48:19.063 --> 48:20.329
Okay, why do get the feeling

48:20.365 --> 48:21.609
I'm about to walk
into the water...

48:21.633 --> 48:23.132
Okay, no more
talking, Doctor.

48:23.167 --> 48:24.200
All right.

48:24.235 --> 48:25.334
Keep your eyes
closed.

48:25.370 --> 48:27.103
Okay, on the count
of three...

Don't look.

Oh, I shouldn't have done
any of this...

- No, no, no...

48:52.563 --> 48:54.530
No, it's...

48:54.565 --> 48:56.165
it's beautiful.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.000
It's...

48:58.036 --> 49:00.069
exactly like when
my grandfather brought it home

49:00.104 --> 49:01.203
for the first time.

49:01.239 --> 49:03.406
Well, it turns out

49:03.441 --> 49:05.641
I probably know
quite a bit about canoes

49:05.677 --> 49:06.842
in my real life.

49:06.878 --> 49:08.177
But honestly,

49:08.212 --> 49:10.313
I could not have done it
without Emily and Alex.

49:12.684 --> 49:14.817
This brings back
so many memories.

49:14.852 --> 49:15.852
Well...

49:15.887 --> 49:19.355
maybe it's time for you
to make some new ones.

49:19.390 --> 49:21.691
Why don't you take Alex out
for her first test drive?

49:21.726 --> 49:23.526
What do you say, bud,
you want to do that?

49:23.561 --> 49:24.327
- Yeah!
- Okay.

49:24.362 --> 49:26.195
But you gotta go next
with me, okay?

49:26.230 --> 49:28.831
- Okay.
- All right.

49:28.866 --> 49:29.665
[sighing wistfully]

49:29.701 --> 49:31.267
Should I go get
the life jackets?

49:31.302 --> 49:32.168
Do that.

49:32.203 --> 49:33.803
I'll come with you.

49:35.073 --> 49:36.839
Thank you.

49:40.945 --> 49:44.280
It is beautiful out here,
huh, son?

49:44.315 --> 49:45.681
Yeah.

49:45.717 --> 49:47.249
Oh, man, I miss
being out here,

49:47.285 --> 49:49.018
that's for sure.

49:49.053 --> 49:51.053
[♪♪♪]

49:51.089 --> 49:52.466
They look pretty good
out there, huh?

49:52.490 --> 49:53.522
Yeah.

49:53.558 --> 49:55.091
They look happy.

49:55.126 --> 49:57.093
Yeah.

49:57.128 --> 49:59.195
See that spot
right over there?

49:59.230 --> 50:00.796
Uh-huh.

50:00.832 --> 50:02.376
That's where your Uncle Jordan
and I got stuck

50:02.400 --> 50:03.632
when we were kids.

50:03.668 --> 50:04.533
What, really?

50:04.569 --> 50:05.946
[chuckling] Yeah.
Got in trouble that day.

50:05.970 --> 50:07.603
I like it here, Dad.

50:07.638 --> 50:10.172
Yeah, me too, son.

50:14.846 --> 50:17.079
Whoa, did you see
that fish jumping?

50:17.115 --> 50:18.080
Where?

50:18.116 --> 50:19.081
Right there.

50:19.117 --> 50:20.716
[splashing]

50:20.752 --> 50:22.585
[laughing]

50:22.620 --> 50:23.586
Okay.

50:23.621 --> 50:25.454
[giggles]

50:25.490 --> 50:27.023
[Jeff sighing]
Ah, it's beautiful.

50:31.696 --> 50:32.973
Emily, what does this
remind you of?

50:32.997 --> 50:34.463
The picnic at Fisher Cove?

50:34.499 --> 50:35.731
Exactly.
Remember that?

50:35.767 --> 50:38.067
With the ants all over
our sandwiches?

50:38.102 --> 50:39.246
Oh, my gosh,
we ate cookies for lunch!

50:39.270 --> 50:40.469
That was the best.

50:40.505 --> 50:41.537
Okay, for the record,

50:41.572 --> 50:43.472
we don't normally get
to eat cookies for lunch,

50:43.508 --> 50:44.974
but it was
a last resort.

50:45.009 --> 50:46.689
Oh, don't worry,
I believe you, Dr. Callan.

50:47.512 --> 50:48.632
What's that
supposed to mean?

50:49.514 --> 50:51.614
Well, you just seem like

50:51.649 --> 50:54.283
a predictably
"by-the-books" kinda guy,

50:54.318 --> 50:55.484
that's all.

50:55.520 --> 50:56.352
Okay, first of all,

50:56.387 --> 50:58.287
I am not a by-the-books
kind of guy.

50:58.322 --> 50:59.255
Oh, really?

50:59.290 --> 51:00.290
What?

51:00.324 --> 51:01.657
I can be spontaneous.

51:01.692 --> 51:03.159
[laughing]

51:03.194 --> 51:04.493
Yeah, right, Dad.

51:04.529 --> 51:05.294
What? I can!

51:05.329 --> 51:06.595
Okay.

51:06.631 --> 51:07.791
Okay, why don't you prove it?

51:08.866 --> 51:10.633
Okay, I will.

51:13.471 --> 51:15.337
What? Now?

51:15.373 --> 51:16.373
[together]: Mm-hmm.

51:17.408 --> 51:18.874
Okay.

51:18.910 --> 51:20.342
Um...

51:20.378 --> 51:22.011
All right.

51:22.046 --> 51:23.479
You ready for this?

51:24.982 --> 51:26.782
Whoa, Dad...

51:26.818 --> 51:28.495
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Where are you going?

51:28.519 --> 51:29.530
You're just kidding, right?

51:29.554 --> 51:30.486
[laughing] Dad...

51:30.521 --> 51:31.521
What are you doing?

51:31.556 --> 51:32.988
No way,
he's just kidding.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.296
[laughing in shock]

51:40.331 --> 51:41.464
Oh, my gosh!

51:41.499 --> 51:42.398
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

51:42.433 --> 51:43.332
Yes, Dad!

51:43.367 --> 51:44.967
[laughing]

51:45.002 --> 51:46.402
You see?

51:46.437 --> 51:48.704
[laughing]

51:54.879 --> 51:56.479
Well...

51:56.514 --> 51:58.214
this is me.

51:58.249 --> 52:00.049
Yup.

52:00.084 --> 52:01.395
Oh, here, let me
give you your jacket.

52:01.419 --> 52:03.219
Oh, no, you, uh,
you keep it.

52:03.254 --> 52:05.488
I know where to find you.

52:05.523 --> 52:08.023
[♪♪♪]

52:10.094 --> 52:12.661
Thanks again for today, Jeff.

52:12.697 --> 52:15.564
I honestly
wouldn't change a thing.

52:16.767 --> 52:19.001
Me neither.

52:19.036 --> 52:21.670
[♪♪♪]

52:21.706 --> 52:22.938
[door opens]
Hey, Dad!

52:22.974 --> 52:25.875
Can I have
a snack before bed?

52:25.910 --> 52:28.010
Alex, it's past your bed...

52:29.881 --> 52:32.715
Yeah, I'll be right in!

52:32.750 --> 52:33.916
[door closes]
Okay.

52:35.119 --> 52:36.051
I should probably go.

52:36.087 --> 52:38.053
Yeah, of course.

52:38.089 --> 52:39.555
Sleep well.

52:39.590 --> 52:41.190
You too.

53:07.752 --> 53:08.717
Hey.

53:08.753 --> 53:09.753
Hi!

53:15.293 --> 53:17.893
Elizabeth, can I
talk to you about something?

53:17.929 --> 53:18.894
Yeah.

53:18.930 --> 53:19.762
Sure.

53:19.797 --> 53:21.397
What's up?

53:23.301 --> 53:24.934
Here's the thing.

53:24.969 --> 53:26.168
I like you.

53:26.204 --> 53:27.636
The kids like you,
that's obvious.

53:27.672 --> 53:28.737
But first and foremost,

53:28.773 --> 53:30.606
I'm your doctor,
you are my patient,

53:30.641 --> 53:32.107
and as long
as that is the case,

53:32.143 --> 53:35.911
I have a code of ethics
that I live by,

53:35.947 --> 53:37.491
which includes not getting
romantically involved

53:37.515 --> 53:39.014
with anyone under my care.

53:39.050 --> 53:40.950
Right.

53:40.985 --> 53:43.519
Yeah, no, I-I agree.

53:43.554 --> 53:44.954
100%.

53:46.824 --> 53:47.656
Good. That's great.

53:47.692 --> 53:48.624
- Good. 'Kay?
- Yup.

53:48.659 --> 53:49.692
Yup.

53:49.727 --> 53:51.527
I mean, as we both know,

53:51.562 --> 53:54.597
I could have a boyfriend
or a husband.

53:54.632 --> 53:56.532
Who knows, I may even
have kids of my own.

53:56.567 --> 53:59.635
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
that-that's true.

53:59.670 --> 54:01.470
Well, good so it's settled,

54:01.505 --> 54:04.139
From now on, we'll just
keep everything very...

54:04.175 --> 54:05.341
professional.

54:05.376 --> 54:06.408
Yeah.

54:06.444 --> 54:07.788
I think that's probably
for the best, you know?

54:07.812 --> 54:09.378
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.480
So, I assume
you're going to go to work?

54:11.515 --> 54:12.548
Yup.

54:12.583 --> 54:13.449
I'll, uh,
I'll stay here,

54:13.484 --> 54:15.618
and I'll help the kids
with Fall Fest.

54:15.653 --> 54:16.619
Yeah, good, that sounds great.

54:16.654 --> 54:17.686
All is well, so...

54:17.722 --> 54:19.333
Oh, right, 'cause tonight's
the final rehearsal

54:19.357 --> 54:20.467
before the big show tomorrow.

54:20.491 --> 54:21.390
Is Emily so excited?

54:21.425 --> 54:23.192
Emily is so excited.

54:29.233 --> 54:30.299
Well, go to work...

54:30.334 --> 54:31.345
- Yes, I'll just go.
- Yeah.

54:31.369 --> 54:32.501
I think that makes...

54:32.536 --> 54:33.836
- It makes...
- It'll help.

54:33.871 --> 54:34.871
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

54:40.544 --> 54:43.646
[♪♪♪]

54:45.283 --> 54:47.816
So, what do
we do first?

54:47.852 --> 54:49.852
Well, we're going
to, um,

54:49.887 --> 54:52.488
re-trace every
single step they made

54:52.523 --> 54:53.934
since the minute
you came into school today.

54:53.958 --> 54:54.857
Good luck,

54:54.892 --> 54:57.059
I can barely remember
what I had for lunch.

54:57.094 --> 54:58.661
I'm sorry,

54:58.696 --> 55:00.396
would my character
even say that?

55:00.431 --> 55:02.531
Sabrina, can you just
please stay in character?

55:02.566 --> 55:04.066
I hate to say it, but, um...

55:04.101 --> 55:06.502
I was kind of thinking
the same thing,

55:06.537 --> 55:08.203
Emily.

55:10.875 --> 55:11.875
I didn't do anything.

55:14.211 --> 55:16.612
So, now what am I
going to do?

55:16.647 --> 55:18.547
Maybe it's not working.

55:18.582 --> 55:20.549
I don't know.

55:20.584 --> 55:21.617
You know what,

55:21.652 --> 55:23.786
why don't we take
a little break.

55:23.821 --> 55:25.254
Emily and I will work
on the script,

55:25.289 --> 55:26.600
and we'll get you
a new one tonight, okay?

55:26.624 --> 55:27.923
- Okay.
- Bye.

55:29.126 --> 55:31.026
Hey, don't worry,

55:31.062 --> 55:32.528
you still have time
to fix this.

55:32.563 --> 55:33.563
Not really.

55:33.597 --> 55:35.698
The play is tomorrow.

55:35.733 --> 55:37.599
What am I even doing?

55:37.635 --> 55:38.635
I'm gonna
embarrass myself

55:38.669 --> 55:40.202
in front of
the entire town.

55:40.237 --> 55:42.037
No. No, you're not.

55:42.073 --> 55:43.706
You're gonna be great,
you'll see.

55:47.345 --> 55:48.243
Thanks.

55:48.279 --> 55:49.790
I don't know how would
have done all of this

55:49.814 --> 55:51.046
without your help.

55:51.082 --> 55:52.748
Aw... that's sweet.

55:52.783 --> 55:54.283
No, I'm serious.

55:54.318 --> 55:56.330
It's important to me that
you're gonna be here tomorrow

55:56.354 --> 55:57.219
to help me get through this.

55:57.254 --> 55:58.254
Okay?

55:58.289 --> 55:59.822
Of course.

55:59.857 --> 56:01.457
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

56:08.265 --> 56:09.732
So, you say

56:09.767 --> 56:12.768
Ms. Young has done
something like this before?

56:12.803 --> 56:14.069
Yeah, a...

56:14.105 --> 56:15.105
a few times,

56:15.139 --> 56:16.338
but only to unwind.

56:16.374 --> 56:18.073
And just for, like,
a weekend or so.

56:18.109 --> 56:19.775
Okay.

56:19.810 --> 56:22.077
Let's see...

56:22.113 --> 56:24.446
I have Angela Young,

56:24.482 --> 56:27.616
5'7", 126 pounds?

56:27.651 --> 56:30.085
Green eyes,
dark-brown hair,

56:30.121 --> 56:32.654
last seen
leaving in a blue Pontiac,

56:32.690 --> 56:33.756
October 3rd,

56:33.791 --> 56:35.157
Tuesday.

56:35.192 --> 56:36.692
Is there
anything else?

56:36.727 --> 56:38.538
We mentioned that she's
a very successful author,

56:38.562 --> 56:39.595
right?

56:39.630 --> 56:40.796
Yes, sir, you did,

56:40.831 --> 56:42.097
several times, yeah.

56:42.133 --> 56:43.866
Is there anything else
we can do on our end

56:43.901 --> 56:45.701
to help?

56:45.736 --> 56:47.770
No, just let us get this
missing person's report

56:47.805 --> 56:49.004
into the system,

56:49.039 --> 56:49.938
and we'll see what pops up.

56:49.974 --> 56:50.974
Okay?

56:51.008 --> 56:52.008
And don't worry.

56:52.042 --> 56:53.375
We're doing everything we can.

56:53.411 --> 56:54.476
Great.

56:54.512 --> 56:55.477
Thank you.

56:55.513 --> 56:56.812
Yeah, no problem.

57:04.221 --> 57:05.320
Are you hard at work,

57:05.356 --> 57:06.989
or hardly working
over here?

57:07.024 --> 57:08.991
Oh, neither.

57:09.026 --> 57:11.059
I'm just writing in my journal,

57:11.095 --> 57:13.061
hoping that I'd trigger
a memory or two.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.963
Sounds like
you deserve a break.

57:14.999 --> 57:18.133
Well, you don't
have to ask me twice.

57:18.169 --> 57:21.503
Mm, something
smells delicious.

57:21.539 --> 57:22.304
That's good timing, Hon'.

57:22.339 --> 57:23.683
I just popped them
out of the oven.

57:23.707 --> 57:26.008
Mm. Oh, my gosh,

57:26.043 --> 57:27.509
these are heaven.

57:27.545 --> 57:28.477
Mm-hmm.

57:28.512 --> 57:29.244
The salty caramel...

57:29.280 --> 57:30.879
Are these, um,
are these pecans?

57:30.915 --> 57:32.514
Yes.

57:32.550 --> 57:34.516
They're absolutely, um...

57:34.552 --> 57:36.518
[clearing throat]

57:36.554 --> 57:37.586
[coughing]

57:37.621 --> 57:39.254
[coughing
and clearing throat]

57:39.290 --> 57:40.322
Elizabeth, what's wrong?

57:40.357 --> 57:42.090
I don't know, um...

57:42.126 --> 57:43.392
Yeah, my throat
just feels...

57:43.427 --> 57:44.427
Here, have some water.

57:46.430 --> 57:47.329
[coughing
and spluttering]

57:47.364 --> 57:48.730
Call Jeff.

57:57.875 --> 57:58.841
[gasps]

57:58.876 --> 57:59.842
Elizabeth...

57:59.877 --> 58:01.176
She's alive!

58:01.212 --> 58:02.845
She's awake.

58:02.880 --> 58:04.413
What happened?

58:04.448 --> 58:06.915
Well, you had
an allergic reaction

58:06.951 --> 58:08.851
to the nuts
in my mom's brownies.

58:08.886 --> 58:10.919
Well, Nana
does say

58:10.955 --> 58:12.454
they're to die for.

[chuckles]

58:13.324 --> 58:15.457
Okay, why don't you
go up to the house

58:15.493 --> 58:16.725
and get ready
for the festival

58:16.760 --> 58:17.893
with your sister,
okay?

58:17.928 --> 58:19.294

Bye.

58:25.970 --> 58:28.103
You gave us quite
the scare last night.

58:28.138 --> 58:29.905
How are you feeling?

58:29.940 --> 58:30.873
I'm okay.

58:30.908 --> 58:33.075
I have a headache,

58:33.110 --> 58:35.143
and my throat's really itchy.

58:35.179 --> 58:36.445
Yeah, that's normal.

58:36.480 --> 58:37.713
It should be gone shortly.

58:39.350 --> 58:40.549

58:40.584 --> 58:42.551
Thank you
for taking care of me.

58:42.586 --> 58:43.586
Again.

58:44.755 --> 58:45.921
Not a problem.

58:45.956 --> 58:47.589
Part of the job.

58:47.625 --> 58:50.392
Is that all it is?

58:52.830 --> 58:53.830
No.

58:53.864 --> 58:55.531
It's not.

59:02.273 --> 59:05.440
I'll go make some coffee, okay?

59:05.476 --> 59:06.642
Okay.

59:06.677 --> 59:08.277
We've got a big day
ahead of us.

59:15.619 --> 59:17.653
[♪♪♪]

59:23.494 --> 59:24.593
I decided

59:24.628 --> 59:26.995
I am going to say something
here on stage at the end.

59:27.031 --> 59:28.997
But do you think
a speech is too much?

59:29.033 --> 59:30.299
No, not at all.

59:30.334 --> 59:31.800
You're the voice
of the story.

59:31.835 --> 59:33.769
And you're
pretty adorable,

59:33.804 --> 59:35.382
but I don't know,
I might be a little biased.

59:35.406 --> 59:36.471
Dad!

59:36.507 --> 59:37.439
Get over here, kiddo.

59:37.474 --> 59:38.307
Yeah!

59:38.342 --> 59:40.709
See, the whole gang
is here, right?

59:40.744 --> 59:42.344
What are you doing
here so early?

59:42.379 --> 59:43.490
Yeah, I thought
you couldn't come

59:43.514 --> 59:44.514
until after work.

59:44.548 --> 59:45.447
I don't know,

59:45.482 --> 59:46.415
I guess I thought
I'd take the day off work

59:46.450 --> 59:49.051
and spend it with
my favorite people, right?

59:49.086 --> 59:51.787
Besides, I've got the office
forwarding my calls,

59:51.822 --> 59:52.999
so technically
I'm still at work.

59:53.023 --> 59:55.624
Well, I guess we'll take
what we can get.

59:55.659 --> 59:57.726
Listen, I was just about
to go help your mom.

59:57.761 --> 59:59.962
Are you going to stick
around here for a bit?

59:59.997 --> 01:00:01.663
I'm not going anywhere today.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:02.965
Okay.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.732
Well, I'll be right back then.

- [giggles]
- You.

01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:15.243
What?

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.678
A guy's not allowed to smile?

01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:18.647
Come on,
we know, Dad.

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:19.982
You know what?

01:00:20.017 --> 01:00:21.850
What's going on
with you and Elizabeth.

01:00:21.885 --> 01:00:22.985
You like her.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.252
It's totally obvious,

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.648
the way you smile
all the time now.

01:00:27.358 --> 01:00:28.724
It's cool, Dad.
We like her, too.

01:00:28.759 --> 01:00:31.526
Okay... listen.

01:00:31.562 --> 01:00:33.996
Guys, I-I know that everybody
really likes Elizabeth,

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:36.531
but you've got to remember
that, you know,

01:00:36.567 --> 01:00:38.200
she's not from here,

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:39.001
and her memory's going
to come back,

01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:40.213
and she's going
to have to leave,

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:41.403
okay?

01:00:41.438 --> 01:00:42.871
You never know.

01:00:42.906 --> 01:00:44.673
Yeah, you both said
she would be gone by now,

01:00:44.708 --> 01:00:45.907
but here we are,

01:00:45.943 --> 01:00:47.442
almost two weeks later
at Fall Fest,

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:48.877
and she's still here.

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:50.523
Okay, I just want you
to be prepared, though,

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:51.513
just in case...

01:00:51.548 --> 01:00:52.414
You worry to much, Dad.

01:00:52.449 --> 01:00:55.050
Trust us, everything's
gonna work out.

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:57.252
All right.

Get in here.

No, of course.

I'm running out
of pages.

I just want to
write everything down

01:01:24.982 --> 01:01:25.647
before I forget.

01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:27.382
Maybe we need to add "writer"

01:01:27.418 --> 01:01:29.384

of possible professions.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.386

is possible.

Hopedale, isn't it?

anywhere else.

in Hopedale,

01:17:15.281 --> 01:17:17.615
I soon learned to make
the most of the experience

01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:18.683
while it lasted.

01:17:18.718 --> 01:17:20.618
What an extraordinary
story.

01:17:20.653 --> 01:17:21.385
Any message

01:17:21.421 --> 01:17:23.921
for the people
who helped you?

01:17:23.956 --> 01:17:26.257
I, uh...

01:17:29.295 --> 01:17:30.428
Well, I, um...

01:17:30.463 --> 01:17:32.663
<i>I just hope they realize</i>

01:17:32.699 --> 01:17:35.232
<i>what an impact they've had
on my life.</i>

01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:39.470
<i>That's it.</i>

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.610
[sound stage bell rings]

01:17:46.646 --> 01:17:48.779
[laughing in delight]
Ange, you were amazing!

01:17:48.815 --> 01:17:49.613
Can you believe that

01:17:49.649 --> 01:17:50.759
they already want you
back on the show

01:17:50.783 --> 01:17:51.816
in a month?

01:17:51.851 --> 01:17:53.095
Oh, be sure to mention
your Twitter handle next time,

01:17:53.119 --> 01:17:54.452
so we can promote
the new book.

01:17:54.487 --> 01:17:55.764
We really want those
Amazon sales to spike...

01:17:55.788 --> 01:17:57.132
I'm not doing
the show tomorrow, Brad.

01:17:57.156 --> 01:17:58.289
What?

01:17:58.324 --> 01:18:00.024
Oh, uh, no problem.

01:18:00.059 --> 01:18:01.025
No problem,

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:02.538
we can save it all
for <i> The Today Show.</i>

01:18:02.562 --> 01:18:04.128
No, I'm not doing
any more interviews.

01:18:04.163 --> 01:18:06.197
I can't do this anymore.

01:18:06.232 --> 01:18:07.398
Got it. You need a break.

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:08.944
We can finally... we can take
that trip to the Berkshires.

01:18:08.968 --> 01:18:10.279
You can write
from the road, I can...

01:18:10.303 --> 01:18:12.803
No, I can't do this...

01:18:12.839 --> 01:18:14.205
anymore.

01:18:15.942 --> 01:18:17.241
Oh.

01:18:18.978 --> 01:18:20.945
I see.

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:24.615
Brad, you are so good
at managing my career.

01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:27.251
We have the perfect...

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:28.719
business relationship.

01:18:28.755 --> 01:18:31.155
But let's be honest,

01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:32.890
you care more
about selling books

01:18:32.925 --> 01:18:34.358
than being my boyfriend.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:37.161
Look, Ange,
I'll be the first to admit

01:18:37.196 --> 01:18:40.464
our relationship,
it could use some work, but...

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.133
overall, we make
a pretty good team,

01:18:42.168 --> 01:18:44.635
don't we?

01:18:44.670 --> 01:18:46.537
Something happened in Vermont.

01:18:48.674 --> 01:18:51.776
I finally figured out
who I was,

01:18:51.811 --> 01:18:54.578
and who I truly
want to be with,

01:18:54.614 --> 01:18:56.847
and as much as I try to go back
to the way things were,

01:18:56.883 --> 01:18:58.616
I just, I just can't.

01:19:00.553 --> 01:19:02.787
I'm sorry.

01:19:02.822 --> 01:19:04.255
It's okay,

01:19:05.458 --> 01:19:06.991
I knew something had changed

01:19:07.026 --> 01:19:08.826
the day we picked you up
in Hopedale.

01:19:08.861 --> 01:19:10.828
I... I could see it
in your eyes.

01:19:14.567 --> 01:19:17.101
I want you to be happy, Ange.

01:19:17.136 --> 01:19:18.169
You deserve it.

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:23.941
You took me places I never
even dreamt for myself.

01:19:26.712 --> 01:19:29.814
I'll always remember
what you did for me.

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:41.725
Hey, promise me
one thing.

01:19:41.761 --> 01:19:43.427
Don't stop writing.

01:19:55.007 --> 01:19:56.140
Oh, Cynthia!

01:19:56.175 --> 01:19:57.074
I don't have time to explain,

01:19:57.109 --> 01:19:58.220
but I need to borrow
your car.

01:19:58.244 --> 01:19:59.143
What? Again?

01:19:59.178 --> 01:20:00.377
Come on, it's brand-new,

01:20:00.413 --> 01:20:01.245
and we have clearly established

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.713
that you're not
a very good driver.

01:20:02.748 --> 01:20:04.068
I promise,
I will never ask again.

01:20:05.184 --> 01:20:06.917
Okay, don't hold me to that.

01:20:06.953 --> 01:20:08.586
You're going back to Vermont,
aren't you?

01:20:08.621 --> 01:20:10.054
Yeah, how'd you know?

01:20:11.224 --> 01:20:12.424
- Is it that obvious?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.059
[car keys jingle]

01:20:15.094 --> 01:20:16.494
Thank you.
I love you, sis.

01:20:16.529 --> 01:20:18.095
I love you, too.

01:20:18.130 --> 01:20:19.130
Oh, hang on!

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.833
Give me your arm.

01:20:22.869 --> 01:20:23.869
Oh...

01:20:25.972 --> 01:20:27.037
[laughing]

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:28.339
"Angela".

01:20:29.642 --> 01:20:31.876
You know, just in case.

01:20:31.911 --> 01:20:33.043
Thank you.

01:20:33.079 --> 01:20:35.045
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:39.683
[♪♪♪]

01:20:46.392 --> 01:20:48.592
[kids giggling]
Okay, toss it back.

01:20:50.997 --> 01:20:52.463
Angela!

01:20:52.498 --> 01:20:54.298
Hi!

01:20:54.333 --> 01:20:55.866
- Angela!
- Hi!

01:20:58.004 --> 01:20:59.570
We thought we'd never
see you again.

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.739
I know, I'm sorry I left
in such a rush.

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:03.307
So dramatic, right?

01:21:03.342 --> 01:21:04.419
Like something
out of your books.

01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:06.110
Ah, speaking of...

01:21:06.145 --> 01:21:09.613
I started working
on a new series.

01:21:12.018 --> 01:21:13.551
"Journey Girl: The Discovery."

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:17.788
"Dedicated to
Emily, Alex, and Jeff,

01:21:17.823 --> 01:21:19.657
who helped me find my way."

01:21:19.692 --> 01:21:20.591
[Alex]: That's us!

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:21.759
Yup.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:22.660
It's only the first
few chapters,

01:21:22.695 --> 01:21:24.273
but I would love for you
to give it a read,

01:21:24.297 --> 01:21:25.729
get your thoughts.

01:21:25.765 --> 01:21:26.697
You know,
writer to writer.

01:21:26.732 --> 01:21:30.467
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna read it right now.

01:21:32.772 --> 01:21:34.672
Hey, kids!

01:21:34.707 --> 01:21:36.674
Want ice cream?

01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:37.908
Thanks!

01:21:40.212 --> 01:21:42.580
Hi.

01:21:42.615 --> 01:21:44.348
Hi.

01:21:44.383 --> 01:21:46.350
What are you doing here?

01:21:46.385 --> 01:21:48.152
What are you doing here?

01:21:48.187 --> 01:21:50.020
I thought
you got out of work at 6:00.

01:21:50.056 --> 01:21:52.756
I decided to loosen
my schedule when you left,

01:21:52.792 --> 01:21:53.991
you know, to spend more time

01:21:54.026 --> 01:21:55.459
doing the things
that make me happy.

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:58.729
Yeah, me too.

01:22:01.968 --> 01:22:03.934
I saw your interview on TV.

01:22:03.970 --> 01:22:06.303
You did?

01:22:06.339 --> 01:22:07.371
I was awful, wasn't I?

01:22:07.406 --> 01:22:10.174
No, it was good.

01:22:13.913 --> 01:22:15.646
Did we really have an impact
on you?

01:22:16.649 --> 01:22:18.549
Yeah.

01:22:18.584 --> 01:22:20.317
Yeah, you did.

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:23.187
Look, Jeff...

01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:28.225
I didn't know who I was

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.060
or where I belonged

01:22:30.096 --> 01:22:33.330
when I first got here...

01:22:35.501 --> 01:22:37.201
But I do now.

01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:40.204
What about your real life?

01:22:43.943 --> 01:22:45.943
This is my real life.

01:22:53.853 --> 01:22:55.519

01:22:59.225 --> 01:23:00.190

01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:01.091
Hey.

01:23:01.127 --> 01:23:02.893
[laughing]

01:23:02.928 --> 01:23:04.328
Go sit down...
