her by a shed in the trees.

us because we saw

02:28.800 --> 02:30.643
their stupid pot field.

guilty, I couldn't sleep.

Why do you feel guilty? We weren't
trying to see their pot field.

Not about that.
I feel guilty because...

02:49.640 --> 02:51.881
It was totally and
completely self-serving.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.011
And I didn't even
really believe it was true

02:55.080 --> 02:56.570
until I saw the shed.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.842
And when I saw it,
I just got this feeling,

02:59.920 --> 03:01.684
like an electric shock.
Like, "Oh, my God,

03:01.760 --> 03:04.843
"that poor dead girl is buried there."

03:04.960 --> 03:07.804

girl is calling us from the grave.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.650
Will you set
the table for me?

14:55.920 --> 14:57.160
I kept Keith's belt.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.241
What?

15:03.080 --> 15:05.686
When we loaded his body
into the car, I kept it.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.167
Why?

(GASPING)

15:19.840 --> 15:20.841
Okay-

15:21.360 --> 15:22.691
Uh, where is it now?

15:25.520 --> 15:27.284
I don't know. What do you
mean, you don't know?

15:27.360 --> 15:29.044
You don't know
where you left it?

15:29.800 --> 15:31.529
I left it under my bed.
Now it's gone.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.529
Are you sure? Maybe it's somewhere else.
I'm sure.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.170
No, it was under my bed.
I hid it there.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.567
You hid it there?

15:38.880 --> 15:41.451
I mean, why?
Why would you do that?

15:41.520 --> 15:44.330
Why would you want
to keep that thing?

15:49.600 --> 15:52.171
I don't know.
I don't know.

16:01.120 --> 16:02.531
(SIGHS)

16:05.160 --> 16:06.969
All right, well,
if the police had found it,

16:07.040 --> 16:09.008
they would have
said something, right?

16:09.080 --> 16:10.525
They would have told us.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.441
I don't know.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.806
Okay, I will be right back.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.687
So can we, uh... Can we
watch it and smoke it?

16:32.600 --> 16:33.806
Not on the job.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.684
How is this even possible?

16:38.600 --> 16:41.251
I mean, don't people
in town get suspicious?

16:41.320 --> 16:43.687
This is what's keeping
this town alive.

16:44.680 --> 16:45.841
Who owns all this?

16:46.440 --> 16:48.363
Couple families
from town.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.442
Who's in charge
of these families?

16:50.520 --> 16:51.965
You ask a lot of questions.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.125
I just don't want to
end up like that guy

16:54.240 --> 16:55.605
who got his warehouse
burned down.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.927
Jerry. He was my boss.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.531
Mid-level guy.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.046
Pissed somebody off, so they
messed him up real good.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.689
Set him on fire
to send a message.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.606
That's a hell of a message.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.488
Yeah, don't worry about it.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.483
They got their own. Eye for an
eye and all that. You know?

17:20.880 --> 17:22.290
You mean that guy hanging
from the yardarm?

17:25.520 --> 17:27.521
Everything should
settle back down now.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.487

17:31.840 --> 17:32.887
Yeah, sure.

(KNOCKING)

18:24.480 --> 18:25.720
We need to talk.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.162
I can't, Emma. My mom's out.
I don't feel good.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.844
But...
No!

18:30.680 --> 18:32.364
I know you passed out.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.365
I never feel good, Norman,
but life keeps moving.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.361
She was real.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.970
If we forget about her,

18:40.040 --> 18:41.530
then the world
will forget about her.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.085
It'll be like
she never existed.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.644
Like her life
didn't matter.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.571
EMMA: See, it's there.

19:01.920 --> 19:02.921
And there.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.240
It's just a number.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.166
In English.

19:06.680 --> 19:09.286
Everything else in here
is in Chinese.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.203
She must have
seen it somewhere.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.127
The journal,
I found it in room four.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.084
Where are you going?
Where do you think?

19:21.440 --> 19:23.363
This is where I found it.
Right here,

19:23.440 --> 19:24.680
under the carpet.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.242
These girls were
brought here from China.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.084
Then guys came to the motel
to try them out.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.005
Who do you think
brought them?

19:36.480 --> 19:37.606
Have you met Keith?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.048
The guy who owned
this place before you?

19:41.000 --> 19:42.809
He's disturbing,
to say the least.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.607
Not someone you want to get
stuck in an elevator with.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.206

here of them chained up to pipes.

Sorry.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.806

20:04.320 --> 20:06.800
Don't most sinks
have pipes like that?

20:08.080 --> 20:10.560
Oh, my God, Norman.
There's something down here.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.246
Looks like...

20:15.760 --> 20:17.569
It's Chinese.

but you seem like
a really nice person,

21:17.960 --> 21:19.928
and right now,
I really need a friend.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.086
I mean, why is this guy
harassing me?

21:25.000 --> 21:26.445
I'm trying to start
a new business.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.921
I have all my money
wrapped up in that place,

21:29.000 --> 21:32.561
and now I'm staring at God knows how
many medical bills with my boy.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.483
Did you know that
he was in the hospital today?

21:34.560 --> 21:35.846
No, I didn't know that.
Is he okay?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.251
He is, he is.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.566
Good.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.847
So I can't tell you
how frustrating it is.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.206
It's irritating.

21:42.320 --> 21:45.130
I can't have cops coming in and
out of my home over nothing.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.887

they found anything.

I'm on duty, Norma.

But we should talk later.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.571
Talk about what?
I'll tell you.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.006
Maybe over dinner?

22:15.400 --> 22:18.643
Why don't you come over
to my place,

22:18.720 --> 22:20.245
say around 8:00?

22:22.920 --> 22:24.046
Okay-

22:28.600 --> 22:30.170
Okay.
Great.

gonna be okay.

put on a face.

23:10.360 --> 23:12.442
Because, Norman, he knows.

WOW. (CHUCKLES)

24:47.400 --> 24:49.209
how 'bout we start with you

24:49.280 --> 24:51.248
telling me
about the belt?

24:52.080 --> 24:55.084
What belt? No, don't, don't, don't...
Don't do that.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.367
Look, if we're gonna
help each other,

24:57.440 --> 24:58.851
we've gotta be honest
with each other.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.161
That is the only thing
that matters to me, Norma,

25:01.240 --> 25:03.527
is honesty.
So please tell me,

25:04.080 --> 25:07.448
why did your son have
Keith's belt under his bed?

25:11.920 --> 25:14.366
That Romero has...
He's got it out for me.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.442
Romero never saw the belt.
He never saw the belt.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.284
I found it. I took it.

25:21.080 --> 25:22.525
So no one else knows.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.081
Thank you.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.971
Keith was a bully.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.449

a hell of a temper.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.088
I notice you have
a bit of a temper yourself.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.447
(CHUCKLES)

25:41.960 --> 25:43.086
I suppose.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.451
What is this? Where did
you get this scar, Norma?

25:50.440 --> 25:52.522
When I was a child.
It's, um,

25:53.280 --> 25:54.884
just an accident.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.810
Was that what
happened to Keith?

26:01.120 --> 26:02.610
Was that an accident?

26:06.080 --> 26:08.048
Norma, did your son
kill Keith?

26:08.360 --> 26:11.284
No, no.
No, of course not, no.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.921
Is there anything else
you wanna say?

26:23.360 --> 26:25.408
What could I possibly say?

26:26.600 --> 26:29.285
Look, I know that you
have spent your life

26:29.400 --> 26:30.925
taking care
of other people.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.202
But you're making
their problems yours.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.845
You're carrying
that weight.

26:37.720 --> 26:40.041
And you wear that
like armor,

26:40.160 --> 26:42.766
but the truth is
it is weighing you down.

26:44.400 --> 26:45.845
I'm gonna change that.

26:48.240 --> 26:51.687
Now I am gonna take care
of you, Norma Bates.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.846
So don't you worry, okay?
Everything is going to be fine.

27:06.440 --> 27:09.842
God, you are so beautiful,
it just makes my heart hurt.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.609
Where'd you learn
to hunt?

27:33.240 --> 27:34.321
South Dakota.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.767
I was on a natural gas fracking
crew outside of Aberdeen.

27:39.360 --> 27:41.761
Not much else to do on the
weekends besides hunt.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.080
That where your family
moved from, South Dakota?

27:50.240 --> 27:53.926
No. No, my brother,
he's 17.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.602
He and my mom moved here
from Arizona.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.124
So where are your folks
originally from?

27:59.680 --> 28:01.409
My dad grew up in Kansas.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.326
Don't talk to him anymore.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.445
But my mom...

28:07.240 --> 28:09.129
Honestly, I don't know
where she's from.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.841
She's talked about Missouri and
told some stories about Colorado.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.440

where your own mom's from?

28:21.080 --> 28:22.605

close or what?

some advice?

I guess calling your mom
a whore is perfectly normal.

Were you in the hospital?

29:38.040 --> 29:39.690
No, you still have
the bracelet on.

29:44.520 --> 29:45.601

29:51.720 --> 29:52.721
Thanks.

You're welcome.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.003
So why isn't mom here
taking care of you?

30:01.440 --> 30:03.647
Shouldn't there be some
homemade chicken soup

30:03.720 --> 30:05.051
on the stove
or something?

30:05.120 --> 30:06.360
Oh, she's out.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.163
She should have
been back hours ago.

my calls or texts.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.170

really worried.

I mean, it's not like her
to just not answer.

I tried to go to bed,
but I just...

30:20.560 --> 30:23.803
You know.
What am I supposed to do?

30:30.680 --> 30:32.603
You need to get out
more, Norman.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.607
What she's doing to you,
it's not healthy.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.129
She's smothering you.

kill me the other night.

I hardly think
I tried to kill you.

with a meat tenderizer.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.081
Oh, I did?

31:09.040 --> 31:10.565
You're making
this up, right?

31:13.400 --> 31:14.447

31:16.240 --> 31:17.605

fear in your heart.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.768
Our family's
so screwed up.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.805
I guess we are.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.727
Well, then I'm sorry
I tried to kill you,

31:39.320 --> 31:41.084
according to you anyway.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.080
It's cool.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.521
Norman.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.962
Mother?
You have to go to bed.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.450
Shh, everything's okay
for now.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.090
What does that mean,
for now?

32:36.040 --> 32:37.644
Zack has the belt.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.246
He does. He hid it, and he
seems to want to help us.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.089
Seems to want to help us?

32:43.360 --> 32:46.489
(STUTTERING) Norman, I... Please.
I'm tired. I'm exhausted.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.961
If anyone ever told me everything
I would've gone through today,

32:49.040 --> 32:51.008
I never would
have believed it.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.327
Okay, all I can tell you is,

32:54.560 --> 32:56.369
feel fairly safe,
so don't worry.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.085
Mom, what does this mean?

33:02.360 --> 33:04.408
Mother, please, I need to know.
I've been waiting all night.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.130
Oh, Norman,
what can I say?

33:07.200 --> 33:09.567
What do you want me to say?
It is what it is.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.322
Deputy Shelby
has the belt,

33:12.440 --> 33:13.771
and he's gonna protect us.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.400
This is a bad idea.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.763
What?
Letting him use you.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.603
I'm not gonna have
this discussion with you.

33:25.760 --> 33:26.886
What if he wants more?

33:26.960 --> 33:28.883
What if he makes you do things,
things you don't want to do?

33:28.960 --> 33:31.167
Well, what do you
want me to say?

33:34.600 --> 33:38.525
Norman, why would you
keep that thing, why?

33:41.160 --> 33:42.525
Why would you keep it?

33:42.600 --> 33:45.171
I just don't understand,
I don't, and I want to.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.928
I just like to keep mementos. You know,
all that stuff I have in my room.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.048
But those were good experiences,
that's good experience.

33:52.120 --> 33:53.963
A day at the lake,
I get that.

33:55.080 --> 33:57.082
This wasn't a good experience.
This was horrible.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.446
It was violent.

34:00.920 --> 34:03.810
I was sexually assaulted,
and I killed a man.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.928
Why would you ever,
ever in a million years,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.161
why would you want to
keep a memento of that?

34:11.800 --> 34:13.643
I'm so sorry, Mother.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.563
(SIGHS)
Don't worry, okay?

34:28.639 --> 34:31.688
Don't worry.
I'm here for you, honey.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.844
I'm here for you,
no matter what.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.045
I'm here for you.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.440
Well, hey.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.841
Hey-

34:57.040 --> 34:58.451
How come
you're at school?

34:58.520 --> 35:01.524
My mom said it would
be good for normalcy,

35:01.600 --> 35:03.011
as if that's possible.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.405
I'm happy to see you.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.364
Um, Norman.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.525
Can I talk to you
for a second?

35:11.760 --> 35:12.807
Sure.

35:19.720 --> 35:21.643
I posted that photo
on Yahoo! Answers

35:21.720 --> 35:22.846
and got it translated.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.768
That Chinese character.
It's Jiao.

35:26.160 --> 35:27.366
It means beautiful.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.645
That's really sad.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.880
I'm going to the police
after school

35:32.960 --> 35:34.405
I'm gonna tell them
about the journal you found.

35:35.760 --> 35:36.921
Do not do that.

35:37.320 --> 35:38.321
Why?

35:38.680 --> 35:41.889
'Cause I don't want to get messed up with the police.
I can't explain it to you.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.448
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this is real.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.846
But finding out what
happened to this girl

35:45.920 --> 35:47.809
isn't gonna make
a difference to anyone.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.008
She's still gonna be dead,
you're still gonna be sick,

35:50.080 --> 35:51.570
and I'm still gonna be
who I am.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.641
I'm sorry.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.481
I'm sorry.

35:59.960 --> 36:03.442
I'm really sorry. I'm just telling you
I can't deal with this right now.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.004
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

36:26.920 --> 36:28.570
NORMA: You were right.

36:30.440 --> 36:33.410
As long as Shelby has that
belt, he can control us.

36:34.080 --> 36:35.605
He can make us
do things,

36:36.360 --> 36:37.885
things we don't want to do.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.410
Just like
your father did.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.680
We can't let that happen,
not again.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.565
This is all your fault.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.325
I know, Mother.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.085
There's something
wrong with me.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.008
You know what you have
to do, don't you?

36:57.960 --> 36:59.803
I have to get that belt.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.325
(GROWLING)

39:47.200 --> 39:49.009
(DOG BARKING)

41:48.120 --> 41:49.770
Are you, uh...
Are you all right?

41:52.480 --> 41:53.641
Help me.
