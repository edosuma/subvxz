I'm sorry, viewer.

00:12.977 --> 00:15.479
The TV show you're
searching for cannot

00:15.480 --> 00:17.981
be streamed in your reality.

00:17.982 --> 00:20.652
Please stand by
for reconnection.

00:25.114 --> 00:27.616
In the darkest depths
of cyberspace,

00:27.617 --> 00:30.869
there is another world.

00:30.870 --> 00:35.332
A lost dimension,
home to wonders unseen,

00:35.333 --> 00:37.168
terrors unspeakable.

00:39.170 --> 00:43.341
Stories unlike any
ever told until now.

We have reconnected to...

00:53.726 --> 00:58.273
<i>Dimension 404.</i>

01:04.319 --> 01:07.322
It's Time Jail for you, Entropy.

01:07.323 --> 01:11.201
You haven't seen the
last of me, Time Ryder.

01:11.202 --> 01:14.663
I'll be back!

01:14.664 --> 01:16.081
Yeah!

01:16.082 --> 01:19.710
Now, before I take you
back to your present,

01:19.711 --> 01:21.878
I want you to always remember...

01:21.879 --> 01:24.089
You are special.
You are special.

01:24.090 --> 01:26.925
You can achieve
incredible things.

01:26.926 --> 01:29.219
The greatest power
in the universe

01:29.220 --> 01:32.348
is right between your ears.

01:34.225 --> 01:36.184
Mom, can I watch one more?

01:36.185 --> 01:37.436
I don't know, Sue.

01:37.437 --> 01:38.603
Did you do your homework?

01:38.604 --> 01:41.315
Not yet, I will
after one more episode.

01:41.316 --> 01:44.402
Please!

01:46.321 --> 01:47.863
I'm almost done,
I just need, like,

01:47.864 --> 01:49.406
one more day.

01:49.407 --> 01:51.450
This is your final paper.

01:51.451 --> 01:53.785
You had the whole semester.

01:53.786 --> 01:55.871
I know, but
I swear, every year

01:55.872 --> 01:58.749
I get one kid with
so much potential,

01:58.750 --> 02:00.751
they got their act together,

02:00.752 --> 02:02.711
they could change the world.

02:02.712 --> 02:05.297
Paper's due at midnight.

02:05.298 --> 02:07.090
You wanna graduate?

02:07.091 --> 02:08.842
Then turn something in.

02:16.726 --> 02:18.393
Hi, Mom. Good news, sweetie.

02:18.394 --> 02:21.313
Grandma's flying
out for graduation!

02:21.314 --> 02:23.148
That is so great.

02:23.149 --> 02:24.399
We're so proud of you, honey.

02:24.400 --> 02:28.612
Our little Einstein
ready to take on the world.

02:28.613 --> 02:30.572
So, factoring in
the speed of light

02:30.573 --> 02:31.823
and the curvature of the Earth,

02:31.824 --> 02:34.660
and adjusting for intermorphic
theory of spacetime,

02:34.661 --> 02:38.080
you have eight hours

02:38.081 --> 02:39.289
to write the whole term paper.

02:39.290 --> 02:41.167
Good, great.

02:42.543 --> 02:43.794
You would've had nine
if you'd just taken

02:43.795 --> 02:46.922
the clock's word
for it, but whatever.

02:46.923 --> 02:49.925
Just start with your name.

02:49.926 --> 02:51.259
And...

02:51.260 --> 02:53.805
And here we go.

02:59.894 --> 03:02.021
 One second.

03:10.988 --> 03:13.073
I'm sure you can't
relate to the struggles

03:13.074 --> 03:14.783
of Susan Hirsch.

03:14.784 --> 03:17.994
After all, you work hard.

03:17.995 --> 03:20.122
You value your time.

03:20.123 --> 03:21.748
You'd never waste
your whole night

03:21.749 --> 03:24.794
watching a science
fiction TV show.

03:26.170 --> 03:29.297
And the dissimilarities
don't stop there.

03:29.298 --> 03:31.383
For Susan Hirsch
is about to discover

03:31.384 --> 03:36.680
a secret so shocking
thatwell, you'll find out.

03:36.681 --> 03:39.892
All in good... time.

03:41.018 --> 03:43.228
Tada.

03:43.229 --> 03:45.021
You've already finished it?

03:45.022 --> 03:48.775
Well, pending the Sue Hirsch
seal of approval, of course.

03:48.776 --> 03:52.321
"Exploring Quantum
Paradoxes" by Alex Kapur.

03:53.739 --> 03:55.574
lt's cute. Thanks!

03:55.575 --> 03:58.493
So, when do I get to see yours?

03:58.494 --> 03:59.744
See my what?

03:59.745 --> 04:01.079
Um, your paper.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.873
What'd you end up writing about?

04:02.874 --> 04:08.587
You know, sciency physics stuff.

04:08.588 --> 04:11.631
My God, you haven't started yet.

04:11.632 --> 04:14.176
I've started thinking about it.

04:14.177 --> 04:15.552
It's due at midnight!

04:15.553 --> 04:16.595
But, you know, by the time

04:16.596 --> 04:17.762
he actually gets
around to reading,

04:17.764 --> 04:19.221
it'll be like 12:30, so

04:19.223 --> 04:20.807
Sue, if you don't finish
I'm gonna finish it.

04:20.808 --> 04:22.101
When?

04:24.979 --> 04:26.438
Tell you what...

04:26.439 --> 04:28.607
if someone from
the future invents

04:28.608 --> 04:30.275
time travel 

04:30.276 --> 04:32.569
I will go back in time

04:32.570 --> 04:34.906
and place my paper right...

04:40.620 --> 04:41.828
here.

04:41.829 --> 04:44.164
You know in order for
that to actually work,

04:44.165 --> 04:46.458
you have to write
the paper first, right?

04:46.459 --> 04:47.584
You know you've got
the wrong equation

04:47.585 --> 04:49.419
for closed
timeline curves, right?

04:49.420 --> 04:51.463
Shut up, don't change
the subject, okay?

04:51.464 --> 04:53.423
'Cause this is about
what did you just say?

04:53.424 --> 04:54.342
That's Deutsch's model.

04:54.343 --> 04:55.675
What you want is Lloyd's.

04:55.676 --> 04:57.677
Like the "who" versus
"whom" of timeline equations.

04:57.678 --> 04:58.887
My God.

04:58.888 --> 05:00.847
Why did I take
theoretical physics?

05:00.848 --> 05:02.098
Okay, maybe this will help.

05:02.099 --> 05:03.850
Remember that episode
of Time Ryder where

05:03.851 --> 05:05.769
they're stuck in ancient Rome?

05:05.770 --> 05:07.813
Season two, "Time, Time Again."

05:07.814 --> 05:10.315
Season two of what now?

05:10.316 --> 05:12.108
"Time Ryder and
the Crono Teens."

05:12.109 --> 05:13.777
What is that, like
a cartoon or something?

05:13.778 --> 05:16.738
You don't remember
"Time Ryder" from the '90s?

05:16.739 --> 05:18.448
Sundial Cartoons?

05:18.449 --> 05:20.492
Must be drawing a blank.

05:20.493 --> 05:22.702
I get it, someone's
zapped the memo eraser

05:22.703 --> 05:24.288
around you, very funny.

05:25.331 --> 05:26.748
Time Ryder uses the memo eraser

05:26.749 --> 05:28.501
to erase people's memories...

05:30.628 --> 05:31.837
You know what, we are watching

05:31.838 --> 05:33.046
an episode right now.

05:33.047 --> 05:34.631
What about the paper?

05:34.632 --> 05:37.008
Just one episode, I promise.

05:37.009 --> 05:37.969
It'll be a night you remember

05:37.970 --> 05:39.554
for the rest of your life.

05:41.806 --> 05:43.974
Boy.

05:43.975 --> 05:46.434
Okay, so it's like
Wishbone meets Captain Planet

05:46.435 --> 05:47.645
but way cooler than.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:00.533 --> 06:02.242
What is that smell?

06:02.243 --> 06:03.285
I don't I don't know,

06:03.286 --> 06:04.411
maybe you're having a stroke.

06:04.412 --> 06:07.163
So, anyway,
Time Ryder is captain

06:07.164 --> 06:08.373
of the Crono Squad.

06:08.374 --> 06:09.499
They defend Earth's timeline,

06:09.500 --> 06:11.669
so every week he
and the Crono Teens...

06:13.170 --> 06:14.505
Must've taken it down again.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.301
Wait...

06:19.302 --> 06:20.760
What?

06:20.761 --> 06:23.346
No, that's impossible.

06:23.347 --> 06:25.223
Well, maybe you
spelled it wrong.

06:25.224 --> 06:26.516
That's also impossible.

06:26.517 --> 06:27.976
I was just watching an
episode and then you rang,

06:27.977 --> 06:29.186
and I stepped on a...

06:32.732 --> 06:34.233
My God.

06:41.282 --> 06:42.866
Any luck down there, Alex?

06:42.867 --> 06:44.034
Not yet.

06:44.035 --> 06:45.827
Hey, don't you
have like a friend

06:45.828 --> 06:47.662
from high school you could ask?

06:47.663 --> 06:49.497
Friend from high school,
that's a good one.

06:49.498 --> 06:50.874
Come on, you don't
have one friend

06:50.875 --> 06:54.044
that you grew up with?

06:54.045 --> 06:55.838
Of course.

07:00.259 --> 07:01.635
Hi, honey.

07:01.636 --> 07:02.969
Hey, Mom!

07:02.970 --> 07:06.515
Silly question, but you
remember "Time Ryder," right?

07:10.436 --> 07:13.021
Sorry, Time what now?

07:13.022 --> 07:14.898
Time Ryder.

07:14.899 --> 07:17.442
Is that a cartoon or something?

07:17.443 --> 07:19.027
Are you kidding?

07:19.028 --> 07:20.945
I watched the cartoons
every day after school.

07:20.946 --> 07:22.989
You bought me the
toys every Hanukkah.

07:22.990 --> 07:24.532
Well, put some on
your list this year,

07:24.533 --> 07:27.119
and we'll see what
Jewish Santa can do.

07:28.954 --> 07:30.163
She doesn't remember it either.

07:30.164 --> 07:33.458
It's like the show
never even existed.

07:33.459 --> 07:36.336
Alex, do you think I'm crazy?

07:36.337 --> 07:38.421
Um...

07:38.422 --> 07:40.924
Maybe you're just having,
like, a panic attack.

07:40.925 --> 07:42.258
Sue, please don't do this.

07:42.259 --> 07:45.095
No time to argue,
it's a fourhour bike ride

07:45.096 --> 07:46.429
to Sundial Cartoons.

07:46.430 --> 07:48.431
They'll have scripts,
they'll have sound,

07:48.432 --> 07:50.433
they'll have
They'll be closed, Sue.

07:50.434 --> 07:51.976
Then I'll peak
through the window.

07:51.977 --> 07:53.937
Even if you're right,
you're throwing your

07:53.938 --> 07:55.855
future away for a cartoon.

07:55.856 --> 07:57.315
It's not real, Sue.

07:57.316 --> 07:59.944
Time Ryder is not real.

08:08.619 --> 08:11.205
History needs your help.

08:13.791 --> 08:15.459
Time Ryder!

08:30.349 --> 08:32.808
I come from the future.

08:32.809 --> 08:36.145
No, a future.

08:36.147 --> 08:39.649
A future where mankind has
reached its full potential.

08:39.650 --> 08:42.027
A future in peril because
there's something that

08:42.028 --> 08:44.446
happens here tonight.

08:44.447 --> 08:47.658
Something that changes
the course of history.

08:49.493 --> 08:50.952
I have traveled to this locus

08:50.953 --> 08:52.912
of space and time
on a desperate mission

08:52.913 --> 08:54.205
to stop it.

08:54.206 --> 08:55.999
So I ask you...

08:56.000 --> 08:58.335
in the name of the
future of humankind...

09:03.090 --> 09:07.802
have you kids seen any
weird shit going on tonight?

09:07.803 --> 09:11.347
Okay, one second, guy.

09:11.348 --> 09:13.349
Sue, we gotta call the cops.

09:13.350 --> 09:14.684
This dude is nuts.

09:14.685 --> 09:16.603
No, he's not, he's Time Ryder.

09:16.604 --> 09:17.771
Haven't you been listening?

09:17.772 --> 09:19.981
He's in a turquoise
motorcycle outfit.

09:19.982 --> 09:21.524
Listen, there can't
be a Time Ryder.

09:21.525 --> 09:23.318
You said it yourself,
Time Ryder's a cartoon.

09:23.319 --> 09:25.696
Yeah, and he's sitting
right in front of us.

09:27.031 --> 09:30.033
Well, that's the
coolest shit I've ever

09:30.034 --> 09:31.242
seen in my life.

09:31.243 --> 09:32.744
Please continue.

09:32.745 --> 09:34.079
You're right, smart guy.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.830
Time Ryder is a cartoon.

09:35.831 --> 09:37.874
One that inspires
an entire generation

09:37.875 --> 09:40.543
of young minds
to pursue science,

09:40.544 --> 09:42.170
including the inventor
of time travel.

09:42.171 --> 09:44.881
I told you it was
a really good show.

09:44.882 --> 09:46.508
Well, we try.

09:46.509 --> 09:48.426
Wait a second, that's it.

09:48.427 --> 09:49.803
Somehow the entire show

09:49.804 --> 09:51.221
is disappearing from existence.

09:51.222 --> 09:54.474
No one remembers it,
even my toys have disappeared.

09:54.475 --> 09:56.434
My God.

09:56.435 --> 09:58.561
That show is the most
important piece of children's

09:58.562 --> 10:00.396
entertainment in the universe.

10:00.397 --> 10:02.816
It's the foundation on
which my future was built.

10:02.817 --> 10:04.819
And if it disappears...

10:06.529 --> 10:07.987
My future's history.

10:07.988 --> 10:09.572
Whoa.

10:09.573 --> 10:11.407
We need to go back.

10:11.408 --> 10:12.784
To the moment this all began.

10:12.785 --> 10:15.078
And we need to find out who...

10:15.079 --> 10:18.332
or what is erasing
that show and stop it.

10:22.419 --> 10:24.420
But I'll need your help.

10:24.421 --> 10:26.214
Are you with me, Crono Teens?

10:26.215 --> 10:27.257
I'm 23.

10:27.258 --> 10:28.424
Then raise your right hand.

10:28.425 --> 10:29.759
Okay.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.511
Do you vow to preserve the past?

10:31.512 --> 10:32.595
We vow. Yes.

10:32.596 --> 10:34.430
Do you swear
to defend the future?

10:34.431 --> 10:36.266
We swear. I swear.

10:36.267 --> 10:38.101
Do you have any
homework due tomorrow?

10:38.102 --> 10:39.435
Give me one second.

10:39.436 --> 10:41.604
Sue, you've gotta
finish your paper.

10:41.605 --> 10:44.190
Um, he has a time machine, duh.

10:44.191 --> 10:45.692
We're good. .

10:45.693 --> 10:46.985
In that case...

10:46.986 --> 10:48.779
Crono Teens unite.

10:51.073 --> 10:52.740
lt goes on top. Yeah, that was

10:52.741 --> 10:54.159
self explanatory, sorry.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.953
Are you ready to ride
the timeline, kids?

10:56.954 --> 10:58.037
Yeah!

10:58.038 --> 10:59.873
Let's ride.

10:59.874 --> 11:01.417
My gosh, my gosh.

11:05.004 --> 11:06.379
Yes.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.047
Is it over?

11:08.048 --> 11:10.050
This never gets old.

11:27.318 --> 11:28.736
One second.

11:45.085 --> 11:47.754
Okay.

11:47.755 --> 11:49.631
These Invisibracelets
are linked to the ROYGBIV

11:49.632 --> 11:51.507
scrambalizer on
my Crono Gauntlet.

11:51.508 --> 11:53.259
As long as you wear them,
no one from the past

11:53.260 --> 11:54.719
can see you or hear you.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.221
This is so cool.

11:56.222 --> 11:58.348
Okay, Alex, here we go.

11:58.349 --> 11:59.682
Tada!

11:59.683 --> 12:01.435
No, no, that's too much crotch.

12:02.770 --> 12:03.687
Tada!

12:03.688 --> 12:04.854
Why, why Jazz hands?

12:04.855 --> 12:06.314
What am I doing?

12:06.315 --> 12:09.067
All right...

12:09.068 --> 12:10.777
Tadow!

12:10.778 --> 12:11.986
Yeah.

12:11.987 --> 12:15.114
You got a fastforward
button on that thing?

12:15.115 --> 12:18.660
I am rank.

12:18.661 --> 12:20.036
Tada!

12:20.037 --> 12:21.621
You've already finished it.

12:21.622 --> 12:23.748
Let's just...

12:23.749 --> 12:25.042
let's keep moving.

12:28.879 --> 12:30.338
You know, by the time
he actually gets around

12:30.339 --> 12:31.881
to reading it,
it'll be like 12:30, so.

12:31.882 --> 12:33.049
Sue, if you don't finish it

12:33.050 --> 12:34.175
I'm gonna finish it.

12:34.176 --> 12:35.468
When?

12:35.469 --> 12:38.721
Okay, tell you what,
if someone from the future

12:38.722 --> 12:40.640
invents time travel...

12:40.641 --> 12:43.269
We're in, keep your eyes
open for any anomalies.

12:45.729 --> 12:46.896
Look, my toys.

12:46.897 --> 12:48.690
I thought you said
they disappeared.

12:48.691 --> 12:50.566
They will, but they haven't yet.

12:50.567 --> 12:53.194
This isn't the past,
it's the past of your past.

12:53.195 --> 12:55.321
Could this be any
more confusing?

12:55.322 --> 12:57.783
It's our past before
our timeline's changed.

12:59.118 --> 13:01.577
Does that mean...

13:01.578 --> 13:03.705
Okay, you remember that
episode of "Time Ryder"

13:03.706 --> 13:05.415
where they get
stuck in ancient Rome?

13:05.416 --> 13:07.625
Really, another
Time Ryder story?

13:07.626 --> 13:09.711
Okay, let's go down
this rabbit hole again.

13:09.712 --> 13:10.962
You remember the show.

13:10.963 --> 13:12.714
I don't remember
remembering the show.

13:12.715 --> 13:14.799
Season two
lt's like you really

13:14.800 --> 13:17.552
did get hit with a memo eraser.

13:17.553 --> 13:18.845
That's impossible.

13:18.846 --> 13:21.055
The only memo eraser
on active service

13:21.056 --> 13:22.391
is right...

13:29.106 --> 13:31.691
Looking for this?

13:31.692 --> 13:33.027
Entropy.

13:36.905 --> 13:40.241
I've waited a long
time for this.

13:40.242 --> 13:44.787
But in some ways it's
been no time at all.

13:44.788 --> 13:47.623
Prepare yourself Time Ryder.

13:47.624 --> 13:51.211
It looks like time
is about to ride you!

13:52.504 --> 13:53.796
Hey, asshole.

13:53.797 --> 13:55.632
 

14:01.805 --> 14:03.681
Okay, first of all,
I knew I wasn't

14:03.682 --> 14:04.974
the stinky one.

14:04.975 --> 14:07.060
And second of all,
who or what the hell was that?

14:07.061 --> 14:08.811
Remember when I told you
I come from a future

14:08.812 --> 14:09.812
that's great?

14:09.813 --> 14:11.105
No. Well, I did.

14:11.106 --> 14:13.483
Anyway, Entropy comes
from a future that sucks.

14:13.484 --> 14:14.776
Of course!

14:14.777 --> 14:16.694
Entropy's the one
trying to erase our show.

14:16.695 --> 14:18.321
With my memories, damn.

14:18.322 --> 14:19.822
We played right into his trap.

14:19.823 --> 14:20.948
We need to go back again.

14:20.949 --> 14:22.825
Trust me, just one episode.

14:22.826 --> 14:24.160
Come here.

14:24.161 --> 14:25.829
Let's ride.

14:43.222 --> 14:44.388
Keep your eyes peeled.

14:44.389 --> 14:45.765
Entropy could attack
anywhere at any time.

14:45.766 --> 14:46.934
There he is.

14:48.352 --> 14:51.105
I am rank.

14:57.027 --> 14:58.152
Damn.

14:58.153 --> 14:59.363
Why us, why now?

15:01.448 --> 15:02.698
We'll ask him when we catch him.

15:02.699 --> 15:04.575
Got a fastforward
button on that thing?

15:04.576 --> 15:07.287
Let's keep moving.

15:09.873 --> 15:12.708
Whywhy would he do that?

15:12.709 --> 15:14.336
Let's move.

15:22.094 --> 15:24.262
We're in, keep your eyes
open for any anomalies.

15:24.263 --> 15:25.973
There.

15:28.725 --> 15:30.059
My toys...

15:30.060 --> 15:31.686
I thought you said
they disappeared.

15:31.687 --> 15:33.396
They will, but they haven't yet,

15:33.397 --> 15:36.899
this isn't your past,
it's the past of your past.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.526
Can this be any more confusing?

15:38.527 --> 15:39.735
Sure can, buddy.

15:39.736 --> 15:42.738
Entropy should reappear
to steal my memo eraser

15:42.739 --> 15:45.242
in T minus There he is.

15:46.660 --> 15:48.077
He stole the memo thing.

15:48.078 --> 15:49.787
Damn!

15:49.788 --> 15:51.414
Tracking his signature.

15:51.415 --> 15:53.708
He's coming back around.

15:53.709 --> 15:55.334
The only memo eraser
in active service

15:55.335 --> 15:57.171
is right...

16:00.257 --> 16:02.133
Looking for this?

16:02.134 --> 16:04.010
Got him.

16:04.011 --> 16:05.596
Hey, asshole.

16:14.146 --> 16:16.272
Damn, we played
right into his trap.

16:16.273 --> 16:17.565
We need to go back again.

16:17.566 --> 16:19.442
Trust me, just one episode.

16:19.443 --> 16:20.735
Come here.

16:20.736 --> 16:21.862
Let's ride!

16:24.448 --> 16:26.324
Okay, and what
the hell was that?

16:26.325 --> 16:27.408
Maybe we won.

16:27.409 --> 16:28.784
Maybe Time Ryder
got the cuffs on him

16:28.785 --> 16:32.164
and he's hauling him
off to Time Base One.

16:38.462 --> 16:39.713
Ryder!

16:42.633 --> 16:44.468
What is that smell?

17:04.279 --> 17:06.405
My God, is he dead?

17:06.406 --> 17:07.990
He's alive.

17:07.991 --> 17:09.407
Okay, so what what do we do?

17:09.409 --> 17:10.992
'Cause, I mean,
has anything like this

17:10.993 --> 17:12.912
ever happened on the show?

17:12.913 --> 17:15.830
Actually, in episode 304.

17:15.832 --> 17:17.041
Of course.

17:18.669 --> 17:19.377
No.

17:19.378 --> 17:20.627
No, no, no, no, no.

17:20.628 --> 17:22.046
Relax, I've seen this
done a million times

17:22.047 --> 17:24.714
on the show, it's just...

17:24.715 --> 17:26.342
Oops. Oops?

17:26.343 --> 17:28.845
Just let me close out of this.

17:30.847 --> 17:32.015
All right.

17:49.366 --> 17:51.410
 One second.

18:10.345 --> 18:11.804
I got it!
Wait, wait, you should

18:11.805 --> 18:13.222
probably stay on
the bed with me.

18:13.223 --> 18:15.809
It's safer.

18:20.522 --> 18:21.606
Tada!

18:21.607 --> 18:23.274
No, too much crotch.

18:23.275 --> 18:25.067
Tadano.

18:25.068 --> 18:26.444
It's jazz hands.

18:26.445 --> 18:27.820
All right.

18:27.821 --> 18:30.448
Tadow.

18:30.449 --> 18:31.533
Tadow!

18:34.411 --> 18:36.163
I am rank.

18:41.001 --> 18:42.960
What?

18:42.961 --> 18:45.881
Looking for this? No!

18:48.008 --> 18:49.468
Tada!

18:56.516 --> 19:00.311
Entropy, you're under arrest
for causality violations

19:00.312 --> 19:03.814
in Continuum Sector 818.

19:03.815 --> 19:06.525
Nice moves, Crono Teens.

19:06.526 --> 19:08.361
Thanks for leaving that note.

19:08.362 --> 19:10.322
Wait, we didn't leave a note.

19:11.740 --> 19:14.200
Guess I left it for myself.

19:14.201 --> 19:15.451
Not a bad move.

19:15.452 --> 19:16.786
You know, it's against
regulations to take

19:16.787 --> 19:18.496
a Crono Captain's
memo eraser without

19:18.497 --> 19:19.997
his consent.

19:19.998 --> 19:23.209
I know, but it was
the only way to make sure

19:23.210 --> 19:25.837
the Entropy didn't
completely erase everything.

19:26.797 --> 19:29.048
It looks like it worked.

19:29.049 --> 19:30.341
Hey...

19:30.342 --> 19:32.968
I think I remember the TV show.

19:32.969 --> 19:36.390
Including that shitty
Christmas special you did.

19:37.599 --> 19:39.183
Everyone's a
critic, aren't they?

19:39.184 --> 19:42.812
Well, it seems as though the
timeline is back on course,

19:42.813 --> 19:45.481
and this case is history.

19:45.482 --> 19:46.650
That's it?

19:48.652 --> 19:50.820
Crono Squad thanks you
for your service.

19:50.821 --> 19:52.488
No, no, that that can't be it.

19:52.489 --> 19:54.115
I mean, what was he doing here?

19:54.116 --> 19:55.491
Why did he coming after us?

19:55.492 --> 19:57.702
I have so many questions.

19:57.703 --> 19:59.120
Of course you do.

19:59.121 --> 20:01.997
You're a scientist, Sue.

20:01.998 --> 20:04.417
But your place is in here now.

20:04.418 --> 20:08.296
Entropy's secrets
belong to the future.

20:11.216 --> 20:14.343
Will I ever will we ever

20:14.344 --> 20:16.512
see you again?

20:16.513 --> 20:18.139
Only time will tell.

20:18.140 --> 20:19.807
Jesus.

20:19.808 --> 20:21.684
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:21.685 --> 20:24.562
I need to take this...

20:24.563 --> 20:27.189
scum back to Time Base One.

20:27.190 --> 20:29.025
Au revoir, Crono Teens.

20:32.362 --> 20:34.114
Let's ride.

20:35.949 --> 20:38.242
Yes!

20:38.243 --> 20:39.453
Yes, yes.

20:42.247 --> 20:43.707
Au revoir.

20:52.883 --> 20:55.718
Well, that was...

20:55.719 --> 20:59.096
an interesting way
to spend an evening.

20:59.097 --> 21:00.890
Oof.

21:00.891 --> 21:04.185
So...

21:04.186 --> 21:06.270
back to work?

21:06.271 --> 21:07.897
How can you say that?

21:07.898 --> 21:09.064
What?

21:09.065 --> 21:10.900
We just traveled through time.

21:10.901 --> 21:13.694
We were Crono Teens.

21:13.695 --> 21:16.906
We can't just pretend
like that didn't happen.

21:16.907 --> 21:20.367
Ryder was right,
this is where we belong.

21:20.368 --> 21:22.077
I can't go back
to the way things were.

21:22.078 --> 21:23.788
Backthis is the back, Sue.

21:23.789 --> 21:27.751
We are back, and you got
a lot of work to do.

21:31.254 --> 21:32.421
You're right.

21:32.422 --> 21:33.547
What are you look.

21:33.548 --> 21:34.882
We do.

21:34.883 --> 21:37.051
Is it happening.

21:37.052 --> 21:39.261
It's Entropy's ring.

21:39.262 --> 21:41.931
The source of all his power.

21:41.932 --> 21:44.725
Great, II wonder
what it's doing here.

21:44.726 --> 21:46.852
I don't know,
but as Crono Teens,

21:46.853 --> 21:49.104
it's our duty to pass it off

21:49.105 --> 21:50.481
to the right authorities.

21:50.482 --> 21:52.191
Are you kid.

21:52.192 --> 21:53.943
Of course it is.

21:53.944 --> 21:55.611
We should give it
back to Time Base One.

21:55.612 --> 21:56.987
It'll be safe there.

21:56.988 --> 21:58.531
I mean, what if it got
into the wrong hands?

21:58.532 --> 22:00.115
It already is
in the wrong hands.

22:00.116 --> 22:01.575
Don't you wanna see
Time Base One?

22:01.576 --> 22:03.702
It's one of the seven
wonders of the galaxy,

22:03.703 --> 22:05.996
and to set this right?

22:05.997 --> 22:07.331
No!

22:07.332 --> 22:08.541
I don't.

22:08.542 --> 22:11.126
So, if you wanna play
time teen, by all means,

22:11.127 --> 22:14.713
butbut you're
on your own, okay?

22:14.714 --> 22:16.131
Fine, suit yourself.

22:16.132 --> 22:17.341
No, that's the wrong answer.

22:17.342 --> 22:21.387
Sue, Sue, you sit down
on this bed, SueSue!

22:21.388 --> 22:23.473
Time Base One! No!

22:33.733 --> 22:35.818
Hey.

22:35.819 --> 22:36.944
Those were on your.

22:36.945 --> 22:38.487
Where are we?

22:38.488 --> 22:40.990
I thought Time Base One
was in the future.

22:40.991 --> 22:42.492
I thought so too.

22:43.660 --> 22:45.953
Judging by the freshness
of that guy's kicks,

22:45.954 --> 22:48.163
I'd say we were in 1995.

22:48.164 --> 22:49.415
We're in the '90s.

22:49.416 --> 22:50.749
Of course.

22:50.750 --> 22:52.126
Ahem!

22:52.127 --> 22:53.335
Hi.

22:53.336 --> 22:55.088
We're here to see Time Ryder.

22:56.548 --> 22:58.299
Did you have an appointment?

22:58.300 --> 23:01.636
No, but we came
to give him this.

23:05.849 --> 23:07.089
What did you say your name was?

23:09.144 --> 23:11.313
Susan Hirsch.

23:12.689 --> 23:15.649
Yeah, well,
come on in, Miss Hirsch.

23:15.650 --> 23:17.234
Yeah, please.

23:17.235 --> 23:19.236
I'll get this to Captain Ryder

23:19.237 --> 23:20.363
right away.

23:36.504 --> 23:39.840
What is going on?

23:39.841 --> 23:41.091
Don't you see, Alex?

23:41.092 --> 23:44.428
Time Base One
is Sundial Cartoons.

23:44.429 --> 23:46.013
That's why the show
looks just like the future

23:46.014 --> 23:49.767
because the show is made
by people from the future.

23:49.768 --> 23:52.394
So, this guy right here

23:52.395 --> 23:53.979
is from the future?

23:53.980 --> 23:54.980
They all are.

23:54.981 --> 23:56.482
Think about it.

23:56.483 --> 23:58.692
Crono Squad's entire mission is
to protect humanity's future,

23:58.693 --> 24:01.320
and what better way to
do that than by inspiring

24:01.321 --> 24:04.573
the children of the past.

24:04.574 --> 24:06.283
Is that who I think it is?

24:06.284 --> 24:07.409
I don't know.

24:07.410 --> 24:08.953
Listen, we saw this place.

24:08.954 --> 24:10.413
Can we please leave?

24:13.208 --> 24:15.751
Hey, future guy.

24:15.752 --> 24:17.586
Nice corduroys.

24:17.587 --> 24:18.755
Yeah.

24:21.466 --> 24:23.300
Mr. Nash?

24:24.761 --> 24:28.764
II'm a really
big fan of your show.

24:28.765 --> 24:31.308
I actually saw you
a while back at CronoCon.

24:31.309 --> 24:33.978
Well, I guess 20 years from now,

24:33.979 --> 24:36.271
but um...

24:36.272 --> 24:37.439
I'm rambling.

24:37.440 --> 24:41.568
Can I get you to sign
something for me?

24:41.569 --> 24:43.780
Name? Susan Hirsch.

24:50.787 --> 24:52.664
Susan Hirsch?

24:56.626 --> 24:58.460
Wally.

24:58.461 --> 25:00.671
Wally Nash.

25:00.672 --> 25:03.799
It's an honor to meet
you, young lady.

25:03.800 --> 25:04.883
It is?

25:04.884 --> 25:07.011
Well, of course it is.

25:07.012 --> 25:09.763
You'll have to excuse us
if we're all a little

25:09.764 --> 25:11.224
star struck.

25:12.684 --> 25:15.645
It's not every day we
meet the Mother of Time.

25:37.459 --> 25:40.712
Yeah, that's me.

25:46.176 --> 25:47.635
Mother of Time.

25:50.930 --> 25:52.014
Come on, guys.

25:52.015 --> 25:53.724
Miss Hirsch has some
urgent business

25:53.725 --> 25:55.350
with Captain Ryder.

25:55.351 --> 25:57.102
Guys, come on.

25:57.103 --> 25:58.437
Okay, what's the problem?

25:58.438 --> 25:59.813
We've been trying to
send Lord Snappington here

25:59.814 --> 26:01.106
back to Time Jail,
but we can't get

26:01.107 --> 26:02.191
a signature lock.

26:02.192 --> 26:03.817
Have you compensated
for signal interference?

26:03.818 --> 26:05.277
That's just it,
the channel's clear,

26:05.278 --> 26:07.279
but we can only read
Time Jail for a few seconds

26:07.280 --> 26:08.947
at a time, almost as if it's.

26:08.948 --> 26:11.076
It's flickering
out of existence.

26:18.124 --> 26:20.460
Is that you, Time Ryder?

26:22.045 --> 26:24.089
I know you can hear me.

26:25.048 --> 26:27.716
What have you done?

26:27.717 --> 26:29.301
No, no, no, no, no.

26:29.302 --> 26:31.887
This is Deutsch's model,
you want Lloyd's model.

26:31.888 --> 26:33.807
You ever see "Time, Time Again"?

26:35.183 --> 26:36.558
Yeah, this whole
thing is a mess.

26:36.559 --> 26:37.559
Thanks.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.811
When's it due again?

26:38.812 --> 26:39.895
Midnight.

26:39.896 --> 26:41.480
Thank God for time travel.

26:41.481 --> 26:43.107
Right.

26:43.108 --> 26:44.442
Wait, what?

26:45.985 --> 26:47.236
What?

26:47.237 --> 26:48.403
I'm whating your what.

26:48.404 --> 26:49.738
So clarify your what.

26:49.739 --> 26:51.865
You still have enough time
to do your paper, right?

26:51.866 --> 26:55.245
Yes, I have a time machine.

26:57.997 --> 26:59.456
Um...

26:59.457 --> 27:01.959
Okay, do you know how
time travel works?

27:01.960 --> 27:05.129
Do you know how
time'cause I'm...

27:05.130 --> 27:06.297
I have no idea.

27:07.799 --> 27:10.425
You know what the best
part of an eternity

27:10.426 --> 27:12.594
in Time Jail was?

27:12.595 --> 27:16.975
I had eternity to think
up the perfect plan.

27:19.811 --> 27:22.104
Even though you are
in the past right now,

27:22.105 --> 27:25.942
your present continues
to move forward without you.

27:26.526 --> 27:27.694
Okay.

27:33.283 --> 27:34.950
You wanna graduate?

27:34.951 --> 27:36.660
Then turn something in.

27:36.661 --> 27:38.829
Sorry, I gotta get out of here.

27:38.830 --> 27:40.455
As we learned with the
LoganPrescott Theory

27:40.456 --> 27:42.457
I know this, any object
traveling through time

27:42.458 --> 27:44.626
must return to its own present.

27:44.627 --> 27:45.711
Yes. .

27:45.712 --> 27:47.546
So even though you
are in 1996 right now,

27:47.547 --> 27:49.006
and it's 2:45pm.

27:49.007 --> 27:52.509
That means in my own
present time it's...

27:52.510 --> 27:53.928
Crap.

27:55.722 --> 27:56.889
I'm sorry.

27:56.890 --> 27:59.516
I'm sorry, II have to go.

27:59.517 --> 28:01.310
Sue, Sue.

28:01.311 --> 28:02.436
LoganPrescott Theorem.

28:02.437 --> 28:04.104
Don't freak out, but our
present is happening

28:04.105 --> 28:05.689
without us. I know.

28:05.690 --> 28:06.690
You know?

28:06.691 --> 28:07.900
You lied to me? I'm sorry.

28:07.901 --> 28:09.610
I just had to see this place.

28:09.611 --> 28:11.862
It was a mistake,
it was a big, big mistake.

28:11.863 --> 28:16.325
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

28:16.326 --> 28:18.494
No, the paper.

28:21.331 --> 28:23.583
Timeline breach detected.

28:27.503 --> 28:29.338
Entropy, you scum.

28:29.339 --> 28:32.674
Save your anger
for the Mother of Time.

28:32.675 --> 28:35.552
She lied to you, Time Ryder.

28:35.553 --> 28:36.679
What are you talking about?

28:38.848 --> 28:40.515
Her homework?

28:40.516 --> 28:42.184
No, she took an oath.

28:42.185 --> 28:44.853
I must've come up
with a million ways

28:44.854 --> 28:46.855
to exact my revenge.

28:46.856 --> 28:49.399
This one wasn't the best,

28:49.400 --> 28:52.361
but it was the most ironic.

28:52.362 --> 28:54.196
It seems you don't need an army

28:54.197 --> 28:57.783
or a doomsday weapon
to destroy the future,

28:57.784 --> 29:00.994
all you need is to give
Susan Hirsch what she

29:00.995 --> 29:02.871
always wanted...

29:02.872 --> 29:05.374
a chance to star in a reallife.

29:05.375 --> 29:09.503
"Time Ryder and the
Crono Teens" adventure.

29:09.504 --> 29:11.922
You're forgetting
one thing, smart guy.

29:11.923 --> 29:13.215
You're in here.

29:13.216 --> 29:14.759
Who's gonna get you out of that?

29:16.636 --> 29:18.304
Isn't it obvious?

29:19.055 --> 29:20.556
I am.

29:22.684 --> 29:23.684
Hey, Captain.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.395
Susan Hirsch is here.

29:26.396 --> 29:28.397
What, how?

29:28.398 --> 29:30.983
She came to bring you this.

29:30.984 --> 29:32.526
Thank you.

29:32.527 --> 29:35.279
Greetings from
the future, Time Ryder.

29:41.077 --> 29:42.245
No!

29:51.504 --> 29:53.798
Thank you.

30:00.430 --> 30:01.431
Damn.

30:09.439 --> 30:10.897
Susan, how could you do this?

30:10.898 --> 30:13.525
I've let you down, I'm sorry.

30:13.526 --> 30:14.609
What's happening?

30:14.610 --> 30:15.819
She didn't do her paper.

30:15.820 --> 30:17.446
She's gonna flunk out of school.

30:17.447 --> 30:18.905
But if she flunks out of school,

30:18.906 --> 30:20.699
she won't get into grad school.

30:20.700 --> 30:21.783
She doesn't go to grad school,

30:21.784 --> 30:22.993
she'll never invent time travel.

30:22.994 --> 30:24.619
She doesn't invent time travel,

30:24.620 --> 30:26.204
the future will never exist,

30:26.205 --> 30:27.330
and neither will we.

30:27.331 --> 30:29.291
Okay, let's just all calm down.

30:29.292 --> 30:32.252
My God, we're all gonna die!

30:32.253 --> 30:34.296
Well, we're still here,

30:34.297 --> 30:35.839
which means we
still have a chance.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.132
My paper's due at midnight.

30:37.133 --> 30:39.051
It's 11:30, and I
haven't even started.

30:39.052 --> 30:40.218
You haven't even started?

30:40.219 --> 30:42.554
Well, I started
thinking about it.

30:42.555 --> 30:43.930
But...

30:43.931 --> 30:46.349
every time I go to write
this stupid paper, it's

30:46.350 --> 30:49.227
it's hard, and I'm worried
I'm gonna be a big failure

30:49.228 --> 30:50.562
and let everyone down,

30:50.563 --> 30:55.318
so I... I put it off,
and I watch cartoons.

30:56.986 --> 30:58.653
I am not the Mother of Time.

30:58.654 --> 31:01.490
I will never be her.

31:01.491 --> 31:04.242
I'm a failure.

31:04.243 --> 31:06.495
No. You're not a failure yet.

31:06.496 --> 31:09.414
Look, the paper's due
on his desk at midnight,

31:09.415 --> 31:12.459
but he's probably not
gonna get to it till 12:30.

31:12.460 --> 31:13.502
So what?

31:13.503 --> 31:15.087
So, if we can stall him,

31:15.088 --> 31:16.630
if we can get him
out of that office,

31:16.631 --> 31:19.300
we can buy Sue time
to finish her paper.

31:21.677 --> 31:22.719
Did I get that right?

31:22.720 --> 31:24.012
Is that how time travel works?

31:24.013 --> 31:25.680
'Cause I'm just a plus one here.

31:25.681 --> 31:29.476
Sue's lessimportant
friend is right.

31:29.477 --> 31:31.353
Yeahall right.

31:31.354 --> 31:33.355
We can buy you the time.

31:33.356 --> 31:34.898
Can you get the job done?

31:34.899 --> 31:37.526
Of course she can.

31:37.527 --> 31:39.195
She's a Crono Teen.

31:43.199 --> 31:45.034
Yeah, I can do it.

32:52.685 --> 32:54.187
Hello?

32:57.398 --> 32:59.108
Hello?

33:02.862 --> 33:04.237
Okay.

33:04.238 --> 33:05.947
Term paper.

33:05.948 --> 33:09.451
The universe hangs
in the balance.

33:09.452 --> 33:12.537
Start with your name.

33:12.538 --> 33:14.372
Your professor.

33:14.373 --> 33:15.791
The date.

33:19.503 --> 33:20.963
First sentence.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.558
Whoever's doing this,
it's not funny!

33:35.186 --> 33:37.438
The dean's gonna
find out about it.

33:39.523 --> 33:40.649
Kicked out of school!

33:40.650 --> 33:42.484
It's worth it.

33:42.485 --> 33:43.653
Hello!

33:53.871 --> 33:55.206
Hah!

34:03.631 --> 34:04.756
Great.

34:04.757 --> 34:06.049
More kneeling.

34:06.050 --> 34:09.261
It seems you cannot
reach your Gauntlet.

34:09.262 --> 34:11.763
You can't snap your
fingers, asshole.

34:11.764 --> 34:15.266
Then I suppose we will just
have to stay like this...

34:15.268 --> 34:17.018
forever.

34:27.780 --> 34:28.739
Hey!

34:28.739 --> 34:30.114
Professor Dobkin.

34:30.116 --> 34:32.701
Alex, was that you
the whole time?

34:32.702 --> 34:34.452
Was what me? You're fighting

34:34.453 --> 34:35.786
stinks worse than your breath.

34:35.788 --> 34:38.165
Breathe it in!

34:41.460 --> 34:43.168
You know you dropped
some papers back there?

34:43.170 --> 34:45.255
No, I got 'em all right here.

34:45.255 --> 34:47.382
No, I'm pretty sure
you dropped more

34:47.382 --> 34:48.509
Alex.

34:54.931 --> 34:56.099
Okay, fine, you know what?

34:56.100 --> 34:57.392
You flunk me, okay?

34:57.393 --> 34:58.476
Because if there's
anything I've learned

34:58.477 --> 34:59.519
from this adventure it's that

34:59.520 --> 35:00.479
Okay, you're flunked. What?

35:00.480 --> 35:01.563
Go away.

35:01.564 --> 35:02.939
I was gonna

35:02.940 --> 35:03.858
I couldn't stop Dobkin.

35:03.859 --> 35:05.400
Alex, what's going on?

35:05.401 --> 35:07.193
You need to hurry, Sue.

35:07.194 --> 35:09.321
I'm typing as fast
as I can think.

35:09.322 --> 35:11.657
Don't flip out!

35:14.744 --> 35:15.952
Heads up.

35:15.953 --> 35:17.203
I think I can do this, Alex.

35:17.204 --> 35:18.122
I'm so close.

35:18.123 --> 35:21.499
Let's table this conversation.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.585
No!

35:23.586 --> 35:27.422
Are you there, Alex?

35:27.423 --> 35:28.465
Alex?

35:28.466 --> 35:29.716
My God, it's so simple.

35:29.717 --> 35:30.800
Alex, what's going on?

35:30.801 --> 35:31.719
Sue?

35:31.720 --> 35:33.262
Keep working on that paper.

35:44.023 --> 35:45.775
Can you feel it?

35:48.110 --> 35:51.697
Your future fading away?

35:59.789 --> 36:01.539
Just let it happen.

36:01.540 --> 36:05.920
Nothing can stop
the spread of Entropy!

36:08.506 --> 36:09.965
Thank you.

36:13.386 --> 36:14.804
No!

36:29.485 --> 36:31.112
Sue!

36:34.323 --> 36:37.326
Alex, what's going on?

36:40.162 --> 36:41.788
Is that you, Time Ryder?

36:41.789 --> 36:43.873
What happened to Alex?

36:43.874 --> 36:46.459
Man down, Sue.

36:46.460 --> 36:48.712
You can stop writing.

36:48.713 --> 36:49.921
What?

36:49.922 --> 36:51.506
I'mI'm almost finished.

36:51.507 --> 36:52.716
It's too late.

36:52.717 --> 36:54.175
You need to get out of there.

36:54.176 --> 36:56.177
The Temporo Porter, go.

36:56.178 --> 36:58.847
It's over, Alex is gone.

36:58.848 --> 37:01.808
Timeline collapse imminent.

37:01.809 --> 37:03.852
Get to the platform,
I can send you back

37:03.853 --> 37:05.019
to your present.

37:05.020 --> 37:07.230
You'll be safe,
but you have to hurry.

37:07.231 --> 37:08.607
What about you?

37:11.318 --> 37:12.820
It's too late for me.

37:16.198 --> 37:18.074
In 30 seconds that
machine won't exist anymore

37:18.075 --> 37:20.035
and you'll be stuck
in the pastgo.

37:22.329 --> 37:24.039
Okay, I'm inside.

37:26.041 --> 37:27.710
Goodbye, Susan Hirsch.

37:31.172 --> 37:34.007
Goodbye, Susan Hirsch.

37:34.008 --> 37:35.593
Goodbye, Time Ryder.

37:42.016 --> 37:44.392
Paradox detected.

37:44.393 --> 37:46.603
It's not working.

37:46.604 --> 37:47.771
"Paradox detected,"
what the hell

37:47.772 --> 37:49.106
is it talking about?

37:50.775 --> 37:52.108
It's talking about me.

37:52.109 --> 37:53.401
Episode 23.

37:53.402 --> 37:55.069
The problem with paradoxes,

37:55.070 --> 37:56.404
in about 30 seconds
I'll be a girl

37:56.405 --> 37:58.907
who remembers a show
that never existed,

37:58.908 --> 38:01.576
which makes me a living,
breathing paradox.

38:01.577 --> 38:03.244
And you can't return
to the present until

38:03.245 --> 38:05.246
the paradox is resolved.

38:05.247 --> 38:07.208
How do I resolve it?

38:17.635 --> 38:18.760
No.

38:18.761 --> 38:20.470
No, no, that is not an option.

38:20.471 --> 38:23.140
It's your only option.

38:24.266 --> 38:26.559
Then I'll find another one!

38:26.560 --> 38:29.562
Sue, you can stay
in the past forever

38:29.563 --> 38:33.900
or let me go and face
the future on your own.

38:33.901 --> 38:35.527
I can't, I mean,
look at me, I'm a mess.

38:35.528 --> 38:38.404
I can'tI can't
do this without you.

38:38.405 --> 38:40.615
Of course you can.

38:40.616 --> 38:42.326
And I'll tell you why...

38:44.078 --> 38:46.997
because you are special.

38:49.124 --> 38:52.460
You can achieve
incredible things.

38:52.461 --> 38:54.630
And the greatest power
in the universe...

38:58.300 --> 39:00.135
is right between your ears.

39:05.307 --> 39:06.809
You don't need me anymore.

39:08.602 --> 39:11.855
You don't need me.

39:11.856 --> 39:13.482
Ryder!

39:35.838 --> 39:37.673
Crono Teens unite.

39:45.431 --> 39:47.433
You are special.

39:50.769 --> 39:53.146
You can achieve
incredible things.

39:53.147 --> 39:54.856
The greatest power
in the universe.

39:54.857 --> 39:57.025
The greatest power
in the universe

39:57.026 --> 39:59.193
is right between your ears.

39:59.194 --> 40:01.405
is right between your ears.

40:23.552 --> 40:24.552
 One second.

40:41.236 --> 40:43.321
Tada!

40:43.322 --> 40:45.156
You've already finished it?

40:45.157 --> 40:48.868
Well, pending the Sue Hirsch
seal of approval, of course.

40:48.869 --> 40:53.831
"Exploring Quantum
Paradoxes" by Alex Kapur.

40:53.832 --> 40:55.750
lt's cute. Thanks.

40:55.751 --> 40:58.628
So, when do I get to see yours?

40:58.629 --> 40:59.837
See my what?

40:59.838 --> 41:01.214
Um, your paper.

41:01.215 --> 41:02.966
What did you end up
writing about?

41:02.967 --> 41:07.805
You know, sciency physics stuff.

41:08.722 --> 41:10.974
You haven't started yet?

41:10.975 --> 41:12.392
Okay, don't panic.

41:12.393 --> 41:14.102
If time travel is invented

41:14.103 --> 41:16.604
Don't do this again, Sue.
in the future,

41:16.605 --> 41:19.108
I would leave it right...

41:23.112 --> 41:24.530
here?

41:25.305 --> 41:31.161
