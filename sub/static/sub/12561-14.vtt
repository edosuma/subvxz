00:01.654 --> 00:03.284
Marisa has diagnosed me, Hank.

00:03.285 --> 00:05.325
She's coming to live
here at shadow pond.

00:06.161 --> 00:08.600
Your prison stay may have
caused endocrine problems.

00:08.601 --> 00:10.859
We should do a workup.
I assume this exam

00:10.860 --> 00:13.219
is protected by the
doctor-patient privilege.

00:13.220 --> 00:14.899
Boris doesn't know
he's gonna be a father.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.464
Thank you for saving my life.

00:17.302 --> 00:18.544
What happened happened.

00:18.545 --> 00:19.838
Talking about it can't help

00:19.839 --> 00:21.416
that it never should
have happened at all.

00:21.417 --> 00:23.215
- Are you okay?
- No.

00:23.216 --> 00:24.626
Are you sleeping with the enemy?

00:24.627 --> 00:26.316
It's pronounced Emily.

00:26.317 --> 00:29.126
Having another doctor,
one with complete autonomy,

00:29.127 --> 00:30.965
would give Hankmed more bandwidth.

00:30.966 --> 00:33.617
Okay, guys,
are there any other options?

00:33.618 --> 00:34.958
Emily peck.

00:35.098 --> 00:37.358
You're the best.
And I miss you, Hank.

00:37.359 --> 00:38.849
I really miss you.

00:47.392 --> 00:48.010
Div...

00:48.011 --> 00:49.371
Hey, how are you?

00:49.372 --> 00:51.036
- Hi, Divya.
- Hey, Divs.

00:51.037 --> 00:53.017
How's Raj?

00:53.018 --> 00:54.477
Say what, now?

00:54.478 --> 00:56.816
- We can't hear you, Div. Div.
- It's not working.

00:56.817 --> 00:57.730
Divya.

00:58.135 --> 01:00.126
I know.
We... we can't hear you!

01:00.127 --> 01:01.073
She's in London.

01:01.074 --> 01:02.676
I don't think talking
any louder's gonna help.

01:02.677 --> 01:03.774
I can't believe this.

01:03.775 --> 01:05.407
This is supposed to be
cutting-edge technology.

01:05.408 --> 01:07.514
We can't have a
conference call to London?

01:07.515 --> 01:08.547
This is so stupid.

01:08.548 --> 01:10.875
We got to upgrade this stupid fossil...
What is this?

01:10.876 --> 01:12.767
She says you've got it on mute.

01:13.297 --> 01:15.646
- You have it on mute.
- No, I don't.

01:15.647 --> 01:16.649
Hello, boys.

01:16.650 --> 01:18.183
- Thank you.
- All right, all right.

01:18.184 --> 01:20.169
- He's a little slow.
- Hi. Um...

01:20.170 --> 01:23.630
Welcome to our first official
online staff meeting.

01:23.631 --> 01:25.077
- That's pretty cool, right? 
- It's exciting. Yeah.

01:25.078 --> 01:26.427
How are you? How's raj doing?

01:26.428 --> 01:28.773
Oh, he's great. We are great.

01:28.774 --> 01:30.142
It was really good for us

01:30.143 --> 01:32.128
to spend a few days alone together.

01:32.129 --> 01:35.516
- Good.
- We even managed to finalize

01:35.517 --> 01:37.620
some of the wedding details.

01:37.621 --> 01:39.740
- Oh, that's cool.
- You will be happy to know

01:39.741 --> 01:42.242
that we have four... an artist...

01:42.243 --> 01:44.698
Ceremony...Sangeeth...
We can't hear you!

01:44.699 --> 01:46.631
- Divya, you're roboting.
- Yeah.

01:46.632 --> 01:48.349
You're like... r... eh... re... eh... r...

01:48.350 --> 01:50.588
- Come on.
- You can imagine the chaos

01:50.589 --> 01:52.384
of trying to get it all organized.

01:52.385 --> 01:54.125
- Yeah, that's got to be...
- Yeah, that's got to be...

01:54.126 --> 01:56.411
- Really chaotic.
- Which leads me...

01:56.412 --> 01:59.770
To giving you my official
three-week notice.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.519
What? But I thought we had more...

02:01.520 --> 02:03.362
- We had four weeks, right?
- Three weeks.

02:03.363 --> 02:05.981
Well, it's four weeks
till the wedding,

02:06.594 --> 02:09.806
uh, but I'll need to be
in London the week before.

02:09.806 --> 02:11.988
- Right.
- Yeah, of course.

02:11.989 --> 02:14.346
Look, I'll be back
later on today,

02:14.347 --> 02:16.251
and we can talk about it then.

02:17.498 --> 02:18.538
Great.

02:18.754 --> 02:20.473
- Hank.
- Yeah.

02:20.474 --> 02:24.023
Have you talked to Dr. Peck
about joining the practice?

02:24.024 --> 02:25.201
She's still in San Diego,

02:25.202 --> 02:26.673
but I'll talk to her
whenever she gets back.

02:26.674 --> 02:28.151
Do you ever think
that maybe next year

02:28.152 --> 02:30.318
you and raj will come
back to the Hamptons

02:30.319 --> 02:32.679
and maybe just be
part of Hankmed again?

02:32.680 --> 02:34.711
Yeah. You could...

02:34.712 --> 02:36.642
I'm sorry I said that, Div.

02:36.643 --> 02:38.870
- Look, just...
- She's not...

02:38.871 --> 02:40.023
Ground control to major Tom.

02:40.024 --> 02:41.941
She's not...
Dude, the thing is frozen.

02:41.942 --> 02:43.997
There's nothing moving.
The circuit's dead.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.483
- What?
- Something's wrong with your...

02:47.291 --> 02:49.058
- Divya!
- I got to go.

02:49.059 --> 02:52.496
Uh, way to go, Einstein.
Nailed it again.

03:08.484 --> 03:10.876
- It's 8:00 in the morning. 
- I know.

03:10.877 --> 03:12.094
We have a permit to start at 7:00

03:12.095 --> 03:13.157
but we waited until 8:00

03:13.158 --> 03:15.011
out of consideration
to the neighbors.

03:15.012 --> 03:16.703
If you'll just bear with us,
we'll be gone soon.

03:16.704 --> 03:19.153
Soon? You've got, like,
20 people running around

03:19.154 --> 03:20.444
- in my backyard. 
- 20?

03:20.445 --> 03:22.351
I don't think it's that many,
although I don't know.

03:22.352 --> 03:24.159
You could be right.
Numbers aren't my thing.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.409
I know. We're supposed
to be good at math.

03:25.410 --> 03:26.361
What are you gonna do?

03:26.362 --> 03:28.511
But I'm a really good driver,
so, uh, it makes up for that.

03:28.512 --> 03:31.737
Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.
Are you the really good driver

03:31.738 --> 03:33.742
who parked his van in my driveway,

03:33.743 --> 03:36.447
forcing me to park out on the
street where my car was towed?

03:36.990 --> 03:39.026
Sorry. Could you excuse me?
I need to deal with this.

03:39.027 --> 03:40.580
Wouldn't want to
inconvenience you.

03:40.581 --> 03:43.491
Hey, I got your text.
Your car got towed?

03:44.307 --> 03:45.303
Yeah. Yeah.

03:45.304 --> 03:46.668
It's a long story.

03:47.264 --> 03:48.529
Ah, thank you so much.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.482
I don't know how I would
have gotten to work.

03:50.483 --> 03:52.749
Yeah. No. What is going on?

03:53.096 --> 03:54.929
They're filming
a reality TV show.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.343
Apparently,
all you need is a camera

03:56.344 --> 03:57.674
and people with no shame.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.349
I've gotten...

03:59.566 --> 04:01.734
I don't know,
maybe eight hours of sleep

04:01.735 --> 04:02.993
in the past three days.

04:02.994 --> 04:05.010
Hmm. Well, why don't
you go to your parents'?

04:05.011 --> 04:07.449
- Because my parents are there.
- Right.

04:07.874 --> 04:09.333
Well, um...

04:10.462 --> 04:12.652
You can stay with me.
I don't think so.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.146
No, really, it's no big deal.

04:14.147 --> 04:15.982
I'll sleep on the couch.
You can have my room.

04:15.983 --> 04:17.694
You won't be uncomfortable?

04:17.695 --> 04:21.107
I won't be uncomfortable.
Will you be uncomfortable?

04:23.965 --> 04:25.556
- I'll get my things.
- Okay.

04:29.743 --> 04:31.979
Go faster,
Craig! They're beating us.

04:32.687 --> 04:34.717
Oh, hell, no!

04:42.510 --> 04:43.852
Aah!

04:47.402 --> 04:48.381
Help!

04:52.386 --> 04:53.664
Help!

04:59.109 --> 05:00.720
I'm a doctor. Take me out there.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.503
Okay, slow, slow.

05:07.694 --> 05:10.957
Jill, I need a board to
immobilize her spine!

05:18.503 --> 05:19.681
Hand me that board.

05:24.412 --> 05:25.600
That's it. That's it.

05:25.823 --> 05:27.659
Can you move your fingers and toes?

05:28.267 --> 05:29.536
It hurts.

05:30.510 --> 05:32.158
Let's get the board
under her feet.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.739
Slide it... slide it under.

05:37.776 --> 05:39.417
That's it. Keep coming.

05:39.613 --> 05:41.806
- You got her head?
- Yeah. It's under her head.

05:41.807 --> 05:44.243
- Hey, can I help?
- Yeah. I need a life jacket.

05:50.365 --> 05:51.656
- Move her head. 
- Got her.

05:53.388 --> 05:54.571
We got it.

06:00.165 --> 06:01.387
Here you go, guys.

06:07.336 --> 06:08.393
That's it.

06:15.527 --> 06:16.931
Oh, I hope she's okay.

06:17.897 --> 06:18.943
Sorry.

06:20.414 --> 06:21.974
And I hope we got it all on tape.

06:49.267 --> 06:51.187
24-year-old female
near-drowning victim

06:51.188 --> 06:53.163
in respiratory arrest for
possibly three minutes.

06:53.164 --> 06:54.998
Mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation initiated

06:54.999 --> 06:56.335
with resumption of respiration.

06:56.336 --> 06:58.716
Now has a gcs of 15...
boarded and collared.

06:58.717 --> 07:00.539
Hamptons heritage got
the trauma alert.

07:03.971 --> 07:05.273
Is she gonna be okay?

07:05.274 --> 07:07.045
Please tell me she's gonna be okay.

07:07.046 --> 07:09.545
She's, like, my best friend.

07:09.877 --> 07:11.843
Uh, they'll do a C.T.
scan at the hospital

07:11.844 --> 07:13.735
to confirm that there's
no spinal damage.

07:13.736 --> 07:14.947
We'll know more then.

07:14.948 --> 07:16.249
Oh, thank God.

07:16.765 --> 07:17.647
Uh...

07:17.972 --> 07:19.046
Okay, okay.

07:20.557 --> 07:22.424
- Hank, right?
- Uh, yeah.

07:22.425 --> 07:24.301
Hey, I'm Tony Lee.
I produce the show.

07:24.302 --> 07:26.166
- Hi.
- I have to tell you,

07:26.167 --> 07:27.053
that was one of the most

07:27.054 --> 07:28.675
incredible things I have ever seen.

07:28.676 --> 07:29.399
Uh, thank you.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.413
If they're gonna jet-ski,
as the producer,

07:31.414 --> 07:33.640
you might want to dial
back on their margaritas.

07:33.641 --> 07:35.020
Oh, actually,
they weren't even drinking.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.794
- They just like to have fun. 
- Oh.

07:36.795 --> 07:39.570
It's not an excuse,
just... an explanation.

07:39.571 --> 07:41.148
- Right.
- Anyway, uh...

07:41.149 --> 07:42.182
I really appreciate it,

07:42.183 --> 07:43.660
and we will definitely
pay you for your time.

07:43.661 --> 07:45.217
Oh. You don't have to pay me.

07:45.218 --> 07:46.449
And, uh, just as a small thing,

07:46.450 --> 07:47.803
if you, uh, could sign this,

07:47.804 --> 07:49.379
it would be very
helpful to the show.

07:49.380 --> 07:50.863
- What is it?
- It's just a legal release

07:50.864 --> 07:52.625
so we can show your face on camera.

07:52.626 --> 07:55.271
Oh. Uh, yeah, I don't think so.

07:56.312 --> 07:57.489
Okay, well, you know what?

07:58.072 --> 07:59.126
Hold on to it.

07:59.127 --> 08:01.895
If... if you're not happy,
we'll blur your face.

08:04.293 --> 08:05.135
Thank you.

08:09.292 --> 08:12.689
A Gatsby party at the
Blackstone club with you?

08:12.690 --> 08:15.228
It's a dream. I'm dreaming.
Like, somebody should pinch me.

08:17.854 --> 08:19.426
Pinch me, not punch me.

08:19.427 --> 08:21.682
- My bad.
- Ow! Okay!

08:21.683 --> 08:23.575
We've established
that I'm not dreaming

08:23.845 --> 08:26.278
and that I have a very low
pain threshold, apparently.

08:26.279 --> 08:27.890
I honestly can't believe

08:27.891 --> 08:29.547
you and your family are
members of Blackstone.

08:29.548 --> 08:30.921
That's, like,
the coolest thing ever.

08:30.922 --> 08:32.917
Yeah, we belong
to a lot of clubs,

08:32.918 --> 08:34.941
but I don't usually tell
people about Blackstone,

08:34.942 --> 08:36.154
because they always end up

08:36.155 --> 08:38.020
wanting to bring
everyone and their uncle.

08:38.022 --> 08:39.134
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:39.135 --> 08:41.004
You don't have to worry
about me or my uncle.

08:41.005 --> 08:42.792
Oh, I wasn't talking about you.

08:42.793 --> 08:44.143
If you wanted to bring
someone sometime,

08:44.144 --> 08:45.176
that would be fine.

08:45.177 --> 08:46.257
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:46.258 --> 08:47.366
That's cool.

08:47.367 --> 08:48.484
Okay. Ready?

08:48.485 --> 08:49.146
Ready.

08:52.462 --> 08:53.443
Whoa.

08:53.702 --> 08:55.952
We look awesome.
Well, you're half right.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.191
What do you mean? Whao!

09:01.889 --> 09:04.043
Apparently, the requirements
for foreign doctors

09:04.044 --> 09:05.624
to practice general
medicine in the U.S.

09:05.625 --> 09:08.654
Are the same for everyone,
regardless of their experience.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.499
It's been a long time
since I've taken a test.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.256
I know it seems like a lot
of hoops to jump through,

09:13.257 --> 09:15.220
especially for someone
of your stature.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.640
Shall I have Anthony
prepare something else?

09:18.392 --> 09:19.911
No, no. The food is fine.

09:20.295 --> 09:22.944
I just don't have that
much of an appetite.

09:23.789 --> 09:25.070
What about research?

09:25.071 --> 09:26.258
That's another option,

09:26.259 --> 09:28.009
and one you can start
doing immediately

09:28.010 --> 09:29.932
without taking any exams.

09:29.933 --> 09:31.007
There are a number of hospitals

09:31.008 --> 09:32.545
interested in her research,

09:33.005 --> 09:35.370
although I'm not eager to
lose you to the lab again.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.017
You feel warm to me.
Are you all right?

09:38.018 --> 09:38.976
I'm fine.

09:40.158 --> 09:42.346
I'm just, um, a little tired.

09:43.111 --> 09:44.423
Will you excuse me?

09:44.873 --> 09:45.928
Of course.

09:53.394 --> 09:54.874
I'm worried about her, Hank.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.640
Ever since she's arrived,

09:56.641 --> 09:59.087
she seems depressed.

09:59.683 --> 10:01.474
And it's not just homesick. It's...

10:02.211 --> 10:03.665
Something different.

10:03.917 --> 10:05.609
Well, maybe she just
needs a little time

10:06.067 --> 10:08.053
to settle into her new life.

10:16.946 --> 10:18.913
I can't believe you
met the whole cast.

10:18.914 --> 10:21.471
Like, I love every single
episode of share house.

10:21.472 --> 10:22.762
I've seen every single one...

10:22.763 --> 10:25.104
Aspen, south beach, Malibu.

10:25.302 --> 10:26.452
You know, it's hard to imagine

10:26.453 --> 10:29.680
that a TV show that appeals to
the lowest common denominator

10:29.681 --> 10:31.411
- would appeal to you. 
- Ha ha!

10:31.715 --> 10:32.523
Yeah.

10:33.187 --> 10:34.869
Sounds like the
party's around back.

10:36.167 --> 10:37.792
- I'm gonna go. 
- Oh, my God.

10:37.964 --> 10:39.033
- I'm going.
- Go get 'em.

10:41.744 --> 10:44.958
No comeback from Evan.
All right, what's going on?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.916
No, no, no, no.
He's just happy you're back.

10:46.917 --> 10:47.735
We both are.

10:48.472 --> 10:50.314
Hank. Thanks for coming.

10:50.315 --> 10:53.144
Sure. Tony, this is Divya,
my physician assistant.

10:53.145 --> 10:55.758
Hi. So, uh, how's Brooke?

10:55.759 --> 10:57.593
Her neck is stiff,
and she's a little bruised,

10:57.594 --> 10:59.309
but there was no spinal damage.

10:59.495 --> 11:01.099
- That's a relief.
- Yeah, it is.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.866
Uh, so why I called...
You remember Craig?

11:03.867 --> 11:05.497
He was driving the
jet ski with Brooke.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.186
- Uh-huh. 
- He was fine all day,

11:08.187 --> 11:11.401
but, uh... now he's
weak and nauseous.

11:11.402 --> 11:12.933
- Well, where is he?
- He's out back.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.792
Thank goodness you're here.

11:23.793 --> 11:25.377
Craig's really not
been feeling well.

11:25.378 --> 11:27.106
I've been so worried about him.

11:27.107 --> 11:27.842
Uh-huh.

11:29.185 --> 11:30.108
Hey, Craig.

11:30.665 --> 11:33.141
- How you doing? 
- Not too good, doc.

11:33.142 --> 11:37.158
I, um... I feel dizzy.
My mouth is dry.

11:37.968 --> 11:39.515
And my vision's kind of blurry.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.851
- The droopiness is bilateral.
- So we can rule out bell's.

11:44.055 --> 11:45.179
And it would be rare

11:45.180 --> 11:47.807
for a stroke to present itself
symmetrically like this.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.228
Pupils are dilated.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.849
- Are your legs weak? 
- Yeah.

11:52.405 --> 11:54.906
Do you have headaches,
any history of seizures?

11:54.907 --> 11:56.133
Are you taking
over-the-counter drugs

11:56.134 --> 11:59.816
- or any type of drugs? 
- No, no, no, and hell, no.

12:00.969 --> 12:02.337
Let me see your eyes for a sec.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.520
Open your mouth. Say, "ahh."

12:07.521 --> 12:08.826
Ahh.

12:09.302 --> 12:10.687
Okay. It's bilateral.

12:11.351 --> 12:13.836
Take your shirt off and sit
forward on the chaise lounge.

12:33.209 --> 12:35.290
How awesome is this
episode gonna be?

12:35.557 --> 12:37.210
This is compelling TV.

12:37.211 --> 12:39.892
I just wish I didn't have
to blur your brother's face.

12:40.555 --> 12:41.491
What's that?

12:42.217 --> 12:43.465
Hank wouldn't sign a release.

12:43.466 --> 12:44.728
That's one of the reasons
I called him back.

12:44.729 --> 12:46.786
I'm trying to change his mind.
No, no, no, no, no.

12:47.213 --> 12:49.221
Let me talk to him. Yeah.

12:50.562 --> 12:51.609
Tony, um...

12:52.784 --> 12:54.261
I'm not sure what's
wrong with Craig.

12:54.262 --> 12:55.856
We'll have to wait and
see the test results.

12:55.857 --> 12:57.983
Well, can he stay here?
He's gonna want to.

12:57.984 --> 12:59.427
- He is?
- Yeah, well...

12:59.776 --> 13:01.646
Well, Craig's our
before-and-after guy.

13:01.647 --> 13:04.920
He used to be really
shy and overweight,

13:04.921 --> 13:06.486
spent his life being invisible.

13:06.690 --> 13:08.120
But he's been working his butt off

13:08.121 --> 13:10.030
to get into shape
and change his life.

13:10.377 --> 13:12.346
And look at him. He did it.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.991
He's a great guy,
and this is his chance to be seen.

13:16.765 --> 13:17.578
Hey.

13:17.996 --> 13:19.502
Am I okay, doc? What did you find?

13:19.928 --> 13:21.944
Well, um... we don't know yet.

13:22.701 --> 13:23.500
Craig,

13:23.713 --> 13:25.997
do you want to stay in the
share house or go home?

13:25.998 --> 13:27.096
What, are you kidding?

13:28.248 --> 13:29.508
I want to stay.

13:31.284 --> 13:32.877
I-I do want to stay.

13:34.798 --> 13:36.220
So what are you thinking?

13:37.004 --> 13:38.162
Guillain-Barre?

13:38.901 --> 13:41.215
Increasing ICP from
mass and herniation?

13:41.216 --> 13:43.858
It could also be lyme,
myasthenia gravis.

13:43.859 --> 13:45.184
Pending lab results,

13:45.185 --> 13:47.330
the course could easily
and rapidly worsen.

13:47.331 --> 13:49.975
So he'll need hourly
neuro assessments...

13:50.495 --> 13:53.254
Monitoring to ensure the
airway remains patent.

13:56.858 --> 13:57.846
I'll stay.

13:58.828 --> 14:00.201
- You sure?
- Yeah.

14:00.427 --> 14:03.670
I'll call you if I need you.
Okay. Good luck.

14:04.022 --> 14:05.417
No margaritas.

14:40.509 --> 14:42.321
Oh, my...
No, no, no, no!

14:42.322 --> 14:43.850
- Aah!
- Aah!

14:44.406 --> 14:45.797
What are you doing here?

14:45.798 --> 14:47.242
Well, not what you
were going to be doing,

14:47.243 --> 14:48.569
I'll tell you that!

14:50.421 --> 14:53.408
- Hand me my bra.
- Yeah. Sure.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.354
What the hell is...?

14:59.495 --> 15:00.507
Dude!

15:00.924 --> 15:02.570
Don't even think about it.

15:03.128 --> 15:04.339
We'll do it later.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.815
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey. That's all right.

15:29.610 --> 15:32.493
Uh... what is all of this?

15:32.494 --> 15:34.679
Ha ha ha. It's my
home away from home.

15:35.272 --> 15:38.510
I spend my life in here watching
other people living theirs.

15:38.995 --> 15:42.511
Everyone has a story to tell,
and my job is to find it.

15:43.270 --> 15:45.867
Well, um...
I'm looking for Craig.

15:46.072 --> 15:48.435
Have you seen him?

15:50.402 --> 15:51.408
Kitchen.

15:52.806 --> 15:54.870
- You're strong.
- Mm. I work out.

15:57.217 --> 15:58.016
Whoa.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.819
I am seeing two of you.

16:02.115 --> 16:03.619
How much have you had to drink?

16:03.851 --> 16:04.932
A lot.

16:05.198 --> 16:06.491
I love your earrings.

16:07.294 --> 16:09.686
Well, that's what separates
us from animals, you know.

16:09.783 --> 16:10.616
Earrings?

16:10.946 --> 16:14.747
Our ability to accessorize.
I design handbags.

16:15.732 --> 16:16.684
You know what?

16:17.072 --> 16:18.689
I need to have Craig
go back to bed.

16:20.170 --> 16:21.276
Alone.

16:39.037 --> 16:41.315
I need to see all the
footage with Craig in it

16:41.316 --> 16:42.473
for the past week.

16:42.650 --> 16:43.410
Okay.

16:54.313 --> 16:56.532
- Good morning.
- Hey.

16:56.533 --> 16:59.138
Okay. How many for breakfast?

16:59.586 --> 17:01.020
- Just the two of us.
- Really?

17:01.021 --> 17:03.856
Yeah. Emily left last night.
Jill left early this morning.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.416
Breakfast of champions.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.509
Ha ha ha.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.792
Fruity puffs...

17:12.929 --> 17:14.404
Breakfast of you.

17:14.628 --> 17:16.608
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

17:20.787 --> 17:22.170
It was all just a mix-up.

17:22.487 --> 17:23.926
Yeah, I kind of gathered that.

17:24.095 --> 17:25.915
Um, was Emily pissed off?
Not at all.

17:25.916 --> 17:27.717
She was cool. She totally
gets it, you know?

17:27.718 --> 17:29.683
I just told her the truth,
and that was that.

17:29.684 --> 17:30.445
That's good.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.572
So it's not gonna be awkward
when we see her later?

17:32.573 --> 17:34.799
Not unless you make it awkward,
which you do.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.893
No, I don't.

17:35.894 --> 17:37.660
Oh, oh, oh! Check it out.

17:39.018 --> 17:41.179
So Tony emailed me some
footage of your rescue

17:41.180 --> 17:42.457
- that he cut together. 
- Mm-hmm.

17:42.807 --> 17:44.678
I'm just gonna preface by saying,

17:45.402 --> 17:46.449
in all seriousness,
I've seen you do

17:46.450 --> 17:48.309
some pretty amazing things
since we've been here.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.154
This trumps all of them.

17:51.086 --> 17:52.284
Help!

17:54.188 --> 17:55.173
Take me out there.

17:57.206 --> 17:58.272
That was pretty good.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.534
Look at your eyes.
Look at the intent.

18:01.535 --> 18:02.790
- I know.
- You're like a cheetah.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.231
Look at the look on her face.

18:14.576 --> 18:16.219
Yep, that was me.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.023
So why not just sign the release?

18:18.024 --> 18:19.571
- Oh...
- I mean, this kind of thing

18:19.572 --> 18:22.171
is life-changing for
regular people, okay?

18:22.172 --> 18:23.286
Just imagine what this could do

18:23.287 --> 18:24.858
for someone who
actually has talent.

18:24.859 --> 18:26.741
How do you want your no,
fast or slow?

18:26.742 --> 18:29.006
Oh, my God. I'm... I'm...
I'm baffled by you.

18:29.007 --> 18:30.168
And I you, my friend.

18:30.169 --> 18:31.898
It's just...
With medicine, you'll try anything.

18:31.899 --> 18:33.498
With everything else,
you're close-minded.

18:33.499 --> 18:34.630
I don't think I'm close-minded.

18:34.631 --> 18:35.898
I know. You think
you're open-minded

18:35.899 --> 18:37.726
when it comes to new things,
which is true,

18:37.727 --> 18:39.357
as long as the new things
are exactly the same

18:39.358 --> 18:40.397
as the old things.

18:40.398 --> 18:41.840
- All right, maybe you're right.
- I am right.

18:41.841 --> 18:44.060
I'll keep an open
mind in the future.

18:49.742 --> 18:51.191
- Come in.
- Thank you.

18:53.729 --> 18:55.781
Please. How are you feeling?

18:57.155 --> 18:58.077
Tired...

18:58.538 --> 18:59.618
Nauseated...

19:00.040 --> 19:01.133
Pregnant.

19:01.649 --> 19:03.372
I'm going to be
needing an O.B. soon,

19:03.373 --> 19:04.458
and I was hoping you
could help me out

19:04.459 --> 19:05.781
with some recommendations?

19:05.782 --> 19:07.742
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

19:07.743 --> 19:09.916
Let me give you a quick
checkup while you're here.

19:12.303 --> 19:15.134
Hmm. Your lymph nodes are swollen.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.875
And you're running a little fever.

19:16.876 --> 19:18.549
Yeah. I might have
a touch of the flu.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.670
Okay.

19:19.874 --> 19:21.438
I guess you'll want
to do a full blood panel

19:21.439 --> 19:24.062
- to rule out infections? 
- Yes...

19:24.440 --> 19:26.815
And a repeat ultrasound.

19:27.306 --> 19:28.446
Arm, please.

19:29.572 --> 19:30.738
Thank you.

19:30.977 --> 19:34.244
So Boris thinks you're
depressed and homesick.

19:34.511 --> 19:36.865
Boris is an
extremely private man.

19:37.414 --> 19:39.218
He's brought you
into his confidence,

19:39.219 --> 19:41.351
and that says something about you.

19:42.089 --> 19:43.684
But don't assume you know him.

19:43.907 --> 19:44.914
I don't.

19:45.426 --> 19:46.919
But keeping something
like this from him

19:46.920 --> 19:48.752
can be stressful to you and maybe...

19:48.753 --> 19:50.881
I will take care of my
relationship with Boris.

19:51.087 --> 19:52.391
Thank you very much.

19:53.284 --> 19:54.296
Okay.

19:59.139 --> 20:01.208
So what we're asking is,

20:01.209 --> 20:03.829
what would you think
about joining Hankmed?

20:05.475 --> 20:07.249
Okay, give me a clue as to
whether you're kidding or not.

20:07.250 --> 20:08.833
- I'm not kidding.
- Good clue.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.287
Divya's getting married
in four weeks, so...

20:11.288 --> 20:13.625
So you want me to replace
a physician assistant.

20:13.626 --> 20:15.198
No, no, no. Not at all, no.

20:15.384 --> 20:17.938
Divya leaving just underscores
how short-staffed we are.

20:17.939 --> 20:19.652
Want you to join as
an equal partner.

20:19.653 --> 20:20.839
Thank you.

20:23.829 --> 20:25.568
That is quite an offer.

20:27.952 --> 20:30.068
I have a counterproposal.
Of course you do.

20:30.069 --> 20:31.783
See, I told you this was a mistake.

20:31.784 --> 20:34.469
A counterproposal
to build on your idea.

20:34.637 --> 20:36.070
Why don't we hear what
the lady has to say,

20:36.071 --> 20:37.801
try to keep an open mind?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.395
When I was in California, I met

20:39.396 --> 20:40.746
with some venture capitalists

20:40.747 --> 20:42.861
who agreed that the
concierge medical practice

20:42.862 --> 20:44.705
is ripe for franchising.

20:44.864 --> 20:47.524
They have money, lots of money.

20:47.758 --> 20:50.170
And they want me to be front
and center for their idea.

20:50.171 --> 20:52.651
Why you? Why not him?

20:52.652 --> 20:53.815
I'm prettier.

20:53.816 --> 20:55.333
But if they want you,
why come to me?

20:55.334 --> 20:57.084
Because you've already
done the hard work.

20:57.889 --> 21:00.340
You've shown how to
deliver concierge medicine

21:00.493 --> 21:01.637
to a community.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.331
We want to franchise it.

21:03.332 --> 21:04.976
How many cities do
you see doing this in?

21:04.977 --> 21:06.227
Just a few to start,

21:06.530 --> 21:08.994
places that have a market
for concierge medicine...

21:09.289 --> 21:12.078
New York, Palm Beach, Los Angeles.

21:12.838 --> 21:14.935
You wouldn't even have
to leave the Hamptons.

21:15.306 --> 21:16.649
All right. Let me think about it.

21:16.844 --> 21:18.284
Yeah, we'll both think about it.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.589
Great.

21:23.080 --> 21:26.340
31 flavors...
That's a lot of flavors.

21:26.663 --> 21:28.855
We both chose jamoca almond fudge.

21:30.117 --> 21:31.098
What are the odds of that?

21:31.230 --> 21:32.074
High.

21:33.961 --> 21:34.939
All right.

21:35.408 --> 21:37.735
I'm thinking of a number
right now between 1 and 100...

21:37.736 --> 21:38.634
100.

21:39.151 --> 21:40.787
Are you kidding me? How did you...

21:41.819 --> 21:42.985
Can you read my mind?

21:43.365 --> 21:44.499
Yes.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.009
What am I thinking right now?

21:52.419 --> 21:53.785
You can read it, all right.

21:55.441 --> 21:57.440
Maybe you can, uh,
help me with something.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.434
Emily's counterproposal.

22:00.605 --> 22:02.222
Okay, now you have
to stop doing that.

22:02.223 --> 22:03.953
That's... that's creeping me out.

22:04.623 --> 22:07.455
Yes, Emily's counterproposal.

22:07.723 --> 22:09.599
I think it sounds
like a good idea.

22:09.740 --> 22:12.065
It is a good idea.
I just feel like...

22:12.689 --> 22:15.062
She's gonna be the captain,
and me and Hank are just

22:15.195 --> 22:16.823
passengers on her ship, you know?

22:16.959 --> 22:19.735
Mm-hmm. Okay, well,
if you decide to go into business

22:19.736 --> 22:21.966
with someone like that,
you can't just react.

22:22.151 --> 22:24.082
You have to be as
aggressive as they are.

22:24.083 --> 22:24.530
Okay.

22:24.755 --> 22:26.691
Make sure you control the agenda.

22:27.117 --> 22:28.483
You call the next meeting.

22:28.645 --> 22:31.079
Totally, yeah.
I'll call her right now.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.623
Hey, in my dad's office,

22:32.624 --> 22:35.462
his chair is three inches
higher than the couch.

22:35.463 --> 22:39.010
So when he has a meeting,
people have to look up to him.

22:40.499 --> 22:41.756
Your dad scares me.

22:46.425 --> 22:49.676
You stayed up all night
and watched these DVDs?

22:49.677 --> 22:52.170
Well, I was looking for clues
as to what was ailing Craig.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.468
And what'd you find out?

22:55.637 --> 22:57.637
- Mikell is a total fake.
- What?

22:57.772 --> 23:00.404
She's had a "showmance"
with every male character

23:00.405 --> 23:01.459
on this show.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.637
She didn't even start
hooking up with Craig

23:03.638 --> 23:05.502
until after his accident.

23:05.503 --> 23:07.301
I'm sorry. Did you
just say "showmance"?

23:07.302 --> 23:10.166
Yeah. It's a relationship
for the sake of the cameras.

23:11.302 --> 23:12.548
- Divya.
- Mm-hmm?

23:12.549 --> 23:13.730
- Divya!
- Yeah.

23:13.731 --> 23:16.115
I think we're losing
sight of why we're here.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.011
You're right.

23:19.173 --> 23:20.468
- Right. 
- Yeah.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.809
Craig's symptoms lock
up with drug abuse.

23:23.810 --> 23:25.610
And he's always sneaking around.

23:25.611 --> 23:28.378
But I haven't found any drugs.

23:28.379 --> 23:29.853
Yeah, his tox screen was clean,

23:30.708 --> 23:32.262
although there are
some designer drugs

23:32.263 --> 23:33.768
that would escape detection.

23:35.171 --> 23:37.183
Craig, it's important that
you're honest with me.

23:37.497 --> 23:39.466
Have you done any kind of drug...

23:39.894 --> 23:41.522
smoked, swallowed, injected,

23:41.523 --> 23:42.415
anything?

23:43.148 --> 23:44.619
Can I talk to you off camera?

23:44.620 --> 23:46.495
We're not trying to make
you feel uncomfortable.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.690
We're just... we're really just
trying to tell your story.

23:48.691 --> 23:50.347
Listen, you can either
turn off that camera,

23:50.348 --> 23:51.211
or you can leave it on,

23:51.212 --> 23:53.356
and I can have this conversation
with Craig someplace else.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.094
Turn it off.

23:58.157 --> 24:00.222
- Okay. Yeah? 
- All right, look...

24:00.512 --> 24:03.076
Working out, staying in shape,
it's very important to me but...

24:04.268 --> 24:06.073
I suffer from hyperhidrosis, so...

24:06.074 --> 24:07.264
Oh, my God!

24:08.160 --> 24:09.291
Is it fatal?

24:09.292 --> 24:12.036
No. Hyperhidrosis
is excessive sweating.

24:12.037 --> 24:13.893
I've always been really
self-conscious about it,

24:13.894 --> 24:16.693
carrying fresh shirts with
me everywhere I go, so...

24:17.018 --> 24:18.243
Just before filming...

24:20.041 --> 24:22.311
I had 20 shots injected
into my armpits.

24:22.312 --> 24:24.637
I just didn't want
to sweat on camera.

24:24.954 --> 24:28.120
And it worked.
I'm as dry as the Sahara.

24:29.133 --> 24:30.207
You used Botox.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.660
No way. I used indelatox.

24:31.661 --> 24:33.472
It's much better than Botox.

24:34.337 --> 24:35.803
You should have told us.

24:35.804 --> 24:37.137
It was too humiliating.

24:37.138 --> 24:39.146
There's nothing too
humiliating for this show.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.984
This is your story.
Your pain can help others.

24:41.985 --> 24:44.968
Craig, indelatox is
derived from a poison.

24:44.969 --> 24:47.176
And some people can
have a bad reaction.

24:47.435 --> 24:50.641
And there can be
unforeseen consequences.

24:50.927 --> 24:51.801
Like what?

24:51.802 --> 24:54.136
- Like botulism.
- Botulism?

25:03.429 --> 25:04.767
- Dr. Lawson?
- Yeah.

25:05.556 --> 25:08.316
Meet Dr. Tripp out of
the CDC headquarters.

25:08.317 --> 25:11.568
Hi. Uh, Jill brought us the
antitoxin from the CDC here.

25:11.569 --> 25:13.577
We're just looking for
guidance on dosage.

25:13.578 --> 25:14.817
- Type "a"?
- Uh-huh.

25:14.818 --> 25:17.633
We believe the botulism was
contracted from 20 injections

25:17.634 --> 25:19.487
to his armpit sweat glands.

25:19.488 --> 25:20.861
Patient has no history of asthma,

25:20.862 --> 25:22.708
no sensitivity in skin test.

25:22.709 --> 25:26.454
All right, give 7,500 I.U.
Via I.V. At a 1-to-10 dilution.

25:26.455 --> 25:27.353
Got it.

25:27.649 --> 25:29.612
It'll take weeks for
the CDC to confirm

25:29.613 --> 25:31.529
that indelatox was the source.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.008
But because the disease
can progress so rapidly,

25:34.009 --> 25:35.085
we're not gonna wait.

25:35.086 --> 25:36.989
- How rapidly?
- We caught it early.

25:36.990 --> 25:39.909
You're gonna be fine.
Will I get better right away?

25:39.910 --> 25:41.628
This'll stop the
progression of the disease,

25:41.629 --> 25:43.954
but it'll take time for the
nerves to repair themselves.

25:43.955 --> 25:45.282
Is he staying here?

25:45.812 --> 25:47.417
Just because it would
break his heart

25:47.418 --> 25:48.863
if he infected us all.

25:49.203 --> 25:51.979
It's not transmitted
person to person.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.541
The clostridium
organisms are injected,

25:54.542 --> 25:56.100
ingested in food,

25:56.101 --> 25:58.489
or, in some cases, grow on wounds.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.386
But it's so kind of you

26:00.387 --> 26:02.206
to care for him so much.

26:04.024 --> 26:05.303
W-what... Hello?

26:05.761 --> 26:06.783
Hello?

26:08.670 --> 26:10.369
Hey, dude, so I noticed

26:10.370 --> 26:12.716
your camera guy's not
getting many shot of Hank's,

26:12.717 --> 26:14.922
uh, second big save in there.

26:15.466 --> 26:16.947
I'm telling you, okay?

26:16.948 --> 26:19.412
I'm telling you I can
convince him to sign off.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.264
Yeah, he's... he's like...

26:21.265 --> 26:23.252
He needs to be worn down,
that's all.

26:23.253 --> 26:24.820
Good, 'cause that'll
be all I have.

26:24.821 --> 26:25.992
What do you mean?

26:26.666 --> 26:28.608
Filming in the
Hamptons is a nightmare.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.701
One of the restaurants won't
let me shoot at night.

26:31.888 --> 26:33.781
Another one says only one camera.

26:34.238 --> 26:35.314
And the nicest places,

26:35.315 --> 26:37.441
the ones that would
really show the cast

26:37.442 --> 26:38.992
breaking into the
elite crowd out here

26:38.993 --> 26:40.908
are totally stiff-arming me.

26:40.909 --> 26:42.783
It's gonna be share house:
Malibu all over again,

26:42.784 --> 26:44.627
but without the palm trees.
Whoa, God.

26:45.453 --> 26:47.501
Well, you always
have botulism, right?

26:48.502 --> 26:50.296
The medical stuff
has been killer.

26:50.699 --> 26:51.740
Yeah.

26:52.841 --> 26:56.101
Maybe you should just follow
a concierge doctor around.

26:57.055 --> 26:59.100
Just picture this for
one second, okay?

26:59.381 --> 27:01.203
Hero doc, all right,

27:01.462 --> 27:02.766
helping the rich and shameless

27:02.767 --> 27:05.248
one thrilling medical
montage at a time...

27:05.249 --> 27:06.458
That's a show.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.900
Could you convince Hank to move?

27:07.901 --> 27:09.509
- Why would he move?
- I just told you.

27:09.510 --> 27:11.115
Filming here is a nightmare.

27:11.359 --> 27:13.429
If I can't get in anywhere,
there's no show.

27:13.430 --> 27:14.799
He is the show.
That's what I'm saying.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.504
You said it yourself...
He's a natural, right?

27:16.505 --> 27:19.062
Listen, Evan, I like the idea.

27:19.275 --> 27:20.975
But with no access to the Hamptons,

27:20.976 --> 27:23.998
it would make concierge doctor:
The Hamptons

27:23.999 --> 27:25.512
a bit of a misnomer.

27:26.334 --> 27:28.997
I got to find out where other
concierge docs are practicing.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.421
What about the Blackstone club?

27:31.422 --> 27:33.918
What if... what if you
could get your whole cast

27:33.919 --> 27:35.132
into the Blackstone club?

27:35.133 --> 27:36.500
- The Blackstone?
- Yeah.

27:36.501 --> 27:37.575
Pipe dream.

27:37.753 --> 27:39.746
What if I could make that
pipe dream come true?

27:50.246 --> 27:52.246
I'm sorry about the
mix-up last night.

27:53.485 --> 27:55.034
"Dear penthouse forum..."

27:56.094 --> 27:57.611
No, seriously,
you should feel free

27:57.612 --> 27:59.063
to stay again if you want.

27:59.492 --> 28:01.776
Mm. I'm not sure I can handle

28:01.777 --> 28:03.525
all the traffic in your bedroom.

28:03.526 --> 28:05.553
Crossing guard starts tonight.

28:05.906 --> 28:07.182
Honestly, Hank...

28:08.549 --> 28:10.023
It kind of bothered me.

28:10.872 --> 28:12.183
I know it shouldn't have.

28:13.205 --> 28:14.717
But it did.

28:15.395 --> 28:17.421
I knew you were seeing her.
It was just...

28:17.711 --> 28:18.796
Different...

28:19.276 --> 28:20.798
Me seeing her.

28:22.173 --> 28:23.259
Right.

28:23.764 --> 28:25.377
I was surprised
to hear from you...

28:25.590 --> 28:27.178
- And so soon. 
- Really?

28:27.179 --> 28:28.725
Not too long ago,
you were calling me a...

28:28.726 --> 28:31.562
Succubus. Yes,
I may have been a tad harsh.

28:31.563 --> 28:33.839
You like the
franchising idea, right?

28:33.840 --> 28:35.211
Even though Hank didn't.

28:35.906 --> 28:37.426
He didn't not like it, though.

28:37.876 --> 28:41.622
There was no stonewall phase or,
like, knee-jerk slap-down.

28:42.061 --> 28:44.443
So that's actually pretty
close to liking it for him.

28:44.616 --> 28:46.527
- You're kidding?
- Yeah, he can be, uh...

28:46.786 --> 28:48.155
Close-minded at times.

28:48.342 --> 28:49.910
He just doesn't jump
into new things...

28:51.146 --> 28:52.317
business things.

28:52.503 --> 28:54.417
So you think Hank
might accept franchising

28:54.418 --> 28:55.791
as part of our partnership?

28:55.792 --> 28:56.618
You do understand

28:56.619 --> 28:58.578
that it would be a
three-way split, right?

28:59.009 --> 29:01.355
The partnership would be yours,
his, and mine.

29:01.356 --> 29:02.750
Okay, without
getting too nitpicky,

29:02.751 --> 29:04.223
since when does a
CFO's contribution

29:04.224 --> 29:06.182
to a medical practice
equal a doctor's?

29:06.183 --> 29:07.669
I'm not all math
and good looks, lady.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.328
I also spearhead marketing and p.R.

29:10.329 --> 29:12.757
In fact, I have a
little side project

29:12.758 --> 29:15.529
that'll dovetail quite
nicely with this new venture.

29:17.332 --> 29:18.459
Our table's ready.

29:27.174 --> 29:29.761
- How's the nausea?
- Gone.

29:29.979 --> 29:32.001
And no bad reaction
to the antitoxin?

29:32.546 --> 29:34.012
- All very positive. 
- Yeah.

29:34.198 --> 29:35.648
Just wish I had more strength.

29:36.523 --> 29:38.600
It's like torture, watching
everybody else have the fun.

29:38.601 --> 29:40.586
Nobody wants to come near me.

29:40.873 --> 29:43.904
Even Mikell is
keeping her distance.

29:44.276 --> 29:46.061
She hasn't come by
to say hi all day.

29:46.259 --> 29:48.120
Coincidentally,
neither have the cameras.

29:54.950 --> 29:57.519
You know,
when I was a little girl,

29:58.524 --> 29:59.739
I was a beanpole...

30:00.198 --> 30:03.692
Stick straight with
a giant head on top,

30:04.759 --> 30:06.615
kind of like a
lollipop with glasses.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.135
Yeah.

30:08.370 --> 30:09.667
See, I had the opposite problem...

30:09.668 --> 30:11.926
Too much lollipop,
not enough stick.

30:11.927 --> 30:14.272
I was the nice chubby guy

30:14.468 --> 30:16.549
all the girls just wanted
to be friends with.

30:19.372 --> 30:21.560
You ever feel like
that beanpole anymore?

30:22.529 --> 30:24.532
More often than
I'd care to admit.

30:26.797 --> 30:29.180
But then that little girl
spent far too much time

30:29.181 --> 30:31.352
worrying whether people liked her.

30:32.132 --> 30:34.382
Now... I'd rather spend time

30:34.383 --> 30:36.904
enjoying the company
of people I like.

30:38.075 --> 30:39.441
Maybe I would be better off

30:39.442 --> 30:42.890
getting that rest in a
nice camera-free hospital.

30:44.204 --> 30:46.126
I'll make the arrangements.

30:51.330 --> 30:53.203
- Toxoplasmosis?
- Mm-hmm.

30:54.107 --> 30:56.201
Yeah, I didn't know much
about where you were...

30:56.966 --> 31:00.084
Detained in Cuba,
so I covered the bases.

31:00.884 --> 31:03.629
And you knew it was a serious
concern for pregnant women.

31:03.796 --> 31:06.221
Now, if you contracted this
before you were pregnant...

31:06.222 --> 31:07.968
Then there's no
danger for the fetus.

31:08.565 --> 31:11.193
But there's no way we can
pinpoint that for sure.

31:11.194 --> 31:12.606
Well, I've ordered
specialized labs

31:12.607 --> 31:15.221
for IGG, IGM, and avidity

31:15.390 --> 31:17.502
to determine how
advanced the disease is.

31:17.823 --> 31:19.688
We need to test for C.N.S. toxo.

31:19.869 --> 31:21.618
Get an l.P. and an MRI.

31:21.887 --> 31:23.660
I haven't seen anything
in your mental status

31:23.661 --> 31:25.494
to raise concerns
about encephalitis.

31:25.495 --> 31:27.378
My mood swings may
not be hormonal.

31:27.877 --> 31:29.868
What did you say...
"cover the bases"?

31:29.951 --> 31:31.689
Yeah, okay. We can do that.

31:33.091 --> 31:34.104
Also, um...

31:34.811 --> 31:36.108
I discovered something...

31:37.860 --> 31:40.613
Interesting about this infection.

31:40.963 --> 31:42.034
What's that?

31:42.302 --> 31:45.313
Well, if you did have this
before you were pregnant,

31:45.314 --> 31:48.907
your odds of having a
boy increase two to one.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.967
And as you know,
Boris' genetic illness

31:52.968 --> 31:54.923
is passed from father to son.

32:03.497 --> 32:05.596
When Boris and I ended
our relationship

32:05.597 --> 32:06.965
five years ago,

32:08.613 --> 32:10.132
it was because of one thing...

32:12.187 --> 32:15.995
One thing I could not
change his mind about...

32:19.035 --> 32:20.374
Children.

32:21.975 --> 32:24.051
He wants his disease
to die with him.

32:37.665 --> 32:40.382
Usually toxoplasmosis is benign

32:40.686 --> 32:42.894
and resolves itself
in a couple of weeks.

32:43.949 --> 32:44.673
But...

32:45.098 --> 32:46.780
Marisa's case is different or...

32:47.170 --> 32:49.308
Hank is concerned I may be

32:49.309 --> 32:51.434
immunocompromised
from my incarceration.

32:52.532 --> 32:54.228
That's the worst-case scenario.

32:54.229 --> 32:55.485
I just want to
proceed with caution,

32:55.486 --> 32:56.836
starting with an MRI.

32:57.403 --> 32:59.380
We'll take the helicopter
to Columbia presbyterian.

32:59.381 --> 33:00.766
I'll make arrangements on the way.

33:00.987 --> 33:03.433
Hamptons heritage is
already expecting us.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.908
Their MRI machine
works exactly the same

33:05.909 --> 33:07.238
as one in Manhattan.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.870
Why did you text me?
Just come inside!

33:18.871 --> 33:20.174
I told you your
name is on the list.

33:20.175 --> 33:21.728
No, I know. Um, I have to make

33:21.729 --> 33:23.125
a little confession first.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.990
It... it's actually
kind of a question.

33:24.991 --> 33:26.401
It's actually more of a
syntax thing, really.

33:26.402 --> 33:29.745
- Evan.
- Is there any world in which

33:29.746 --> 33:31.570
your offer for me
to invite somebody

33:31.828 --> 33:35.518
might be extrapolated to
include 12 somebodies?

33:35.519 --> 33:37.597
- 12?
- Yeah, just...

33:38.068 --> 33:39.273
Yeah, it's, um...

33:41.278 --> 33:42.151
Um...

33:44.954 --> 33:46.999
Hey. Is that a... is that a n...

33:48.673 --> 33:50.226
It's cool. I-I'll send them away.

33:50.227 --> 33:51.341
I'll just tell them right now.

33:51.555 --> 33:52.627
- Hey, what's up? 
- Hey.

33:52.628 --> 33:54.990
Wait, wait. Share house?

33:55.206 --> 33:58.895
Same as share house: South beach,
Malibu, Aspen?

33:58.896 --> 33:59.821
Ha ha. That's the one.

33:59.822 --> 34:01.212
Hi, guys.

34:01.284 --> 34:03.756
I'm so thrilled you're
doing a Hamptons one.

34:03.757 --> 34:04.801
Well, thanks to Evan.

34:06.321 --> 34:08.388
Um, actually, guys...

34:08.389 --> 34:11.056
A-actually, uh,
we... we can't promise anything,

34:11.056 --> 34:13.382
but I will talk to the
executive manager.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.748
He's an old family friend.
Okay. Thank you.

34:16.599 --> 34:18.264
And you're gonna need a
smaller camera than that.

34:18.266 --> 34:19.719
Yeah, you'll need a
smaller camera than that.

34:22.188 --> 34:24.074
- Thank you so much.
- Absolutely.

34:26.520 --> 34:27.618
Let's party.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.289
Well?

34:41.995 --> 34:43.716
Uh, let's go inside.

34:47.900 --> 34:48.705
Hi.

34:49.058 --> 34:51.222
- What did you find?
- May I speak freely?

34:52.255 --> 34:53.145
Please.

34:53.319 --> 34:54.619
No lesions on your brain.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.482
Your MRI was completely clean.

34:57.865 --> 35:01.239
So what now... Antibiotics?
It's an infection, yes?

35:01.240 --> 35:02.696
Yes, yes, of course.

35:04.049 --> 35:05.758
Can you get me some water, please?

35:07.358 --> 35:08.466
All right.

35:11.420 --> 35:14.323
Spiramycin is better than
pyrimethamine-sulfonamide

35:14.324 --> 35:15.573
for pregnant patients.

35:15.574 --> 35:16.906
As for fetal infection...

35:16.907 --> 35:18.809
We can't know until
the amniocentesis,

35:18.810 --> 35:21.066
which we can't do
for several weeks.

35:21.067 --> 35:24.199
About the time you'll find
out if it's a boy or a girl.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.243
Well...

35:26.602 --> 35:28.622
Sometimes you just
have to wait and see.

35:28.880 --> 35:30.387
But we can do
biweekly ultrasounds,

35:30.388 --> 35:32.622
watch for developmental milestones.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.375
Paige.

36:09.902 --> 36:11.014
This is awesome.

36:12.073 --> 36:14.055
And you get to mingle with the
cast of your favorite show.

36:14.056 --> 36:14.869
That's cool.

36:15.752 --> 36:18.514
- It's not my favorite.
- Why did you let them in?

36:18.719 --> 36:21.716
Because I didn't want them
to feel as let down as I do.

36:22.716 --> 36:24.280
They're not the
ones who screwed up.

36:24.696 --> 36:25.614
Wait.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.627
I'm sorry. I thought...

36:27.798 --> 36:29.987
You thought that I
would ignore the fact

36:30.195 --> 36:32.266
that you completely took advantage

36:32.473 --> 36:33.714
after I told you

36:33.715 --> 36:36.221
how much I hate when
people take advantage.

36:36.222 --> 36:38.060
No, no... I'm so sorry.

36:38.061 --> 36:40.969
I-I know. I-I-I got excited.

36:40.970 --> 36:43.350
I saw a business opportunity.
I jumped on it.

36:43.351 --> 36:45.121
It... it... I'm an idiot.

36:45.505 --> 36:46.329
I know.

36:46.555 --> 36:48.267
Can we get past it so we can focus

36:48.268 --> 36:49.886
on what's really
important right now,

36:49.887 --> 36:52.718
which is how beautiful
my outfit looks...

36:52.719 --> 36:53.813
And yours?

36:54.817 --> 36:56.720
- Paige, I'm sorry. 
- No, don't.

36:57.792 --> 36:58.890
You hurt me,

36:59.203 --> 37:02.318
and you can't just charm
your way out of this.

37:06.041 --> 37:07.307
Oh, excuse me.

37:08.202 --> 37:10.566
Mikell. Mikell?

37:11.394 --> 37:13.540
You all right?
Do I look all right?

37:13.846 --> 37:16.254
They make the mint
juleps really strong here.

37:16.423 --> 37:17.558
Do you want me to get
you a glass of water?

37:17.559 --> 37:18.983
No, I've seen this before

37:19.027 --> 37:20.616
with Hank's patient
at the share house.

37:21.684 --> 37:22.841
- Oh!
- Mikell?

37:23.119 --> 37:24.891
Um, let's sit you down.

37:24.892 --> 37:25.853
Here we go.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.325
There you go. Mikell.

37:29.461 --> 37:32.033
Mikell. Hey, Mik... Mike?

37:32.926 --> 37:34.277
Um, Paige, don't be mad.

37:34.590 --> 37:36.981
I need to invite just
a few more people.

37:36.982 --> 37:38.923
- Who?
- Hank...

37:39.909 --> 37:41.314
Maybe some paramedics too.

37:43.009 --> 37:44.849
So apparently, Craig's botulism

37:44.850 --> 37:46.454
was not from indelatox.

37:46.455 --> 37:48.151
It was something the whole
house was exposed to.

37:48.152 --> 37:49.635
Yeah, Divya's checking there now.

37:49.636 --> 37:51.430
I told her to start
with the booze cabinet.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.410
Actually, they
probably weren't drunk.

37:53.411 --> 37:55.414
Slurred speech, double vision,
coordination problems

37:55.415 --> 37:56.922
are all symptoms of botulism.

37:56.923 --> 37:58.154
- No way.
- Mm-hmm.

37:58.155 --> 38:00.678
- Will they be okay?
- In a few weeks, yeah.

38:00.679 --> 38:03.558
- Thank goodness.
- I guess the show can go on.

38:04.034 --> 38:05.639
- Happy ending, at least.
- Mm-hmm.

38:05.640 --> 38:08.123
And it'll, uh,
help me sell my new idea.

38:08.301 --> 38:11.236
I want to do a show in an
emergency room like this one.

38:11.237 --> 38:13.891
What about the
concierge-doctor idea?

38:14.042 --> 38:17.037
- I think this'll be bigger.
- Yeah. Cool.

38:17.604 --> 38:18.980
Hey, Divya, what'd you find?

38:19.144 --> 38:20.690
Okay, so I was thinking
about the footage

38:20.691 --> 38:22.100
from the share house cameras,

38:22.272 --> 38:23.493
and it struck me.

38:23.705 --> 38:26.003
Craig was always
sneaking into the kitchen

38:26.004 --> 38:28.478
in the middle of the
night to meet Mikell,

38:28.677 --> 38:30.100
although she was
spending a lot of time

38:30.101 --> 38:31.918
in the hot tub with Matt.

38:32.694 --> 38:34.666
That girl will go
anywhere there's a camera.

38:34.667 --> 38:35.774
Uh, Divya.

38:36.017 --> 38:37.874
What does that have
to do with botulism?

38:37.875 --> 38:38.986
I saw Craig...

38:39.652 --> 38:43.054
Opening up some salsa one
night before Mikell arrived.

38:43.055 --> 38:44.393
Then when we visited them,

38:44.394 --> 38:46.157
the rest of the cast
was having some.

38:46.158 --> 38:47.384
So I found the jar,

38:47.385 --> 38:49.427
and the top was bulging slightly...

38:49.859 --> 38:51.328
Indicating contamination.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.648
Yep. Okay.

38:56.121 --> 38:57.006
Craig...

38:57.550 --> 38:59.329
Did you eat any salsa

38:59.330 --> 39:01.367
the night before
your symptoms began?

39:02.091 --> 39:04.048
Uh...Yeah.

39:05.359 --> 39:06.098
I'm...

39:06.541 --> 39:08.263
Kind of an emotional eater.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.932
It's the stress of the
show and meeting Mikell.

39:10.933 --> 39:11.757
I just didn't...

39:11.758 --> 39:13.924
That is so sweet!

39:15.309 --> 39:16.922
Hey, what took you so long?

39:17.335 --> 39:19.759
The camera's been on me
for at least 30 seconds.

39:20.980 --> 39:22.096
Could you call the CDC

39:22.097 --> 39:23.520
and make sure they
track down the source?

39:23.521 --> 39:25.421
There could be other
contaminated jars.

39:25.932 --> 39:26.865
Thank you.

39:29.949 --> 39:32.757
Wow, that was nice work,
detective.

39:33.332 --> 39:35.852
Seriously... It's too bad
you had to watch so much

39:36.146 --> 39:38.812
"lowest common denominator"
television to do it, but...

39:38.813 --> 39:40.923
You know, I actually understand

39:40.924 --> 39:44.593
why people are so drawn
into reality television.

39:44.828 --> 39:46.288
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:46.538 --> 39:48.061
It's a great escape from reality.

39:48.221 --> 39:49.228
It is.

39:49.568 --> 39:51.742
Wait. You want to
escape from reality?

39:51.920 --> 39:53.433
Which part of reality?

39:55.058 --> 39:58.026
Dr. Tripp. Yes, I...

39:58.198 --> 39:59.626
Yes, I've been trying
to get a hold of you.

40:10.345 --> 40:12.157
It's good to have
you back in town.

40:13.973 --> 40:16.654
But you found a way
to keep my spot warm.

40:16.911 --> 40:17.943
I told you.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.784
She was just sleeping
here to escape the noise

40:20.785 --> 40:23.113
at her place.
You did tell me that.

40:24.360 --> 40:25.826
Look, we're just friends.

40:27.481 --> 40:28.850
I know you're friends.

40:29.743 --> 40:31.912
I'm not sure about the
"just" part, but...

40:36.956 --> 40:38.327
It's true.

40:39.348 --> 40:40.958
I know you think it's true.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.681
She might even think it's true,
but it's not.

40:44.889 --> 40:46.863
You're saying we're
secretly dating each other

40:46.864 --> 40:48.101
without our knowledge?

40:48.308 --> 40:50.236
Believe me,
I don't want to see this.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.070
But...

40:53.385 --> 40:55.657
I think there are
unresolved feelings there...

40:56.396 --> 40:57.829
On both sides.

40:59.103 --> 41:01.133
Okay, then maybe we
should talk about that.

41:04.038 --> 41:05.492
No, we shouldn't...

41:06.837 --> 41:08.579
Not even a little bit.

41:26.340 --> 41:28.263
- Did you just email me?
- Yep.

41:29.464 --> 41:30.805
I'm right here.

41:31.032 --> 41:32.650
Yeah, I'd like a
record of your response...

41:32.819 --> 41:34.025
uh, an email trail.

41:41.957 --> 41:43.817
"Will you return to
the Hamptons next summer

41:43.818 --> 41:45.337
to work for Hankmed?"

41:49.033 --> 41:50.335
I don't know.

41:50.892 --> 41:52.438
Written reply, please.

42:04.033 --> 42:05.384
"I don't know" is not a no.

42:05.909 --> 42:07.714
So I have an on the record "maybe."

42:08.194 --> 42:09.140
Good.

42:15.878 --> 42:17.019
Boris, hey.

42:17.227 --> 42:19.108
Just dropping off the
antibiotics for Marisa.

42:19.307 --> 42:20.813
You on your way out?

42:21.578 --> 42:23.749
I actually wanted to speak
with you before you saw her.

42:23.921 --> 42:25.065
Everything okay?

42:25.560 --> 42:27.218
That was to be
my question to you.

42:29.008 --> 42:30.275
Oh, well, if you're concerned,

42:30.276 --> 42:31.506
you should really talk to Marisa.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.740
I'm talking to you, Hank.

42:34.176 --> 42:36.374
What were you two discussing
in the MRI chamber?

42:37.307 --> 42:38.775
You know I can't tell you that.

42:38.776 --> 42:40.852
May I remind you where
you're standing, Hank?

42:41.717 --> 42:44.548
My property, my largesse helps
make your business possible.

42:44.549 --> 42:45.685
And I appreciate it.

42:47.619 --> 42:49.305
But you have to talk to Marisa.

42:51.401 --> 42:52.861
She won't tell me anything.

42:57.164 --> 42:58.281
So just...

43:00.149 --> 43:01.601
Is she going to be all right or...?

43:03.506 --> 43:05.125
You have to talk to Marisa.
