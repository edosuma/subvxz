00:08.625 --> 00:10.709
- Hi, I'm Ricky Harper,

00:10.750 --> 00:12.375
and I'm here floating in space

00:12.417 --> 00:14.750
to show you

00:12.417 --> 00:14.750
how qualified I am

00:14.792 --> 00:16.709
for the Rocket Science

00:14.792 --> 00:16.709
Industries'

00:16.750 --> 00:18.542
Junior Astronaut Program.

00:18.583 --> 00:21.583
- Space alien attack!

00:18.583 --> 00:21.583
- Stop it.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.834
You're ruining my application.

00:23.875 --> 00:28.542
- Uh-oh, must find

00:23.875 --> 00:28.542
space fire hydrant.

00:28.583 --> 00:30.917
both: Asteroid attack!

00:30.959 --> 00:34.083
[thudding]

00:34.125 --> 00:37.125
- So as you can see,

00:34.125 --> 00:37.125
not only can I survive

00:37.166 --> 00:39.291
an alien and asteroid attack,

00:39.333 --> 00:42.250
I can also survive the attack

00:39.333 --> 00:42.250
of these annoying life-forms

00:42.291 --> 00:44.166
known as my fellow quadruplets.

00:44.208 --> 00:46.750
So choose me, Ricky Harper.

00:46.792 --> 00:49.125
If anyone needs space...

00:49.166 --> 00:50.291
it's me.

00:50.333 --> 00:54.375
- [alien voice]

00:50.333 --> 00:54.375
E.T. plug nose.

00:54.417 --> 00:57.875
- Seriously, I'm begging you.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.417
- Ew, space snot.

00:59.458 --> 01:03.083
- Hey, hey, hey,

00:59.458 --> 01:03.083
are those my snow boots?

01:03.125 --> 01:05.041
- Yes.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.041
- Eww, get your sweaty feet

01:05.083 --> 01:07.333
out of them!

01:05.083 --> 01:07.333
- It's not sweaty feet.

01:07.375 --> 01:10.083
It's a condition called

01:07.375 --> 01:10.083
"pedal hyperhidrosis."

01:10.125 --> 01:12.375
It's just one of the ways

01:10.125 --> 01:12.375
I process stress.

01:12.417 --> 01:15.709
But don't worry, right now,

01:12.417 --> 01:15.709
I'm perfectly calm.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.667
[dripping]

01:17.709 --> 01:20.291
Uh-oh.

01:20.333 --> 01:21.500
[thud]

01:23.959 --> 01:27.709
- Yeah, I don't see you

01:23.959 --> 01:27.709
getting into the program.

01:27.750 --> 01:30.834
- Oh, I'm getting in,

01:27.750 --> 01:30.834
and I'm staying in because,

01:30.875 --> 01:33.000
unlike you three

01:30.875 --> 01:33.000
aimless drifters,

01:33.041 --> 01:34.792
I have a plan for my life.

01:34.834 --> 01:36.667
- Yeah, well, I have

01:34.834 --> 01:36.667
a plan for my life.

01:36.709 --> 01:38.583
It starts with eating

01:36.709 --> 01:38.583
a pastrami sandwich for lunch.

01:38.625 --> 01:40.792
- Well, Mae and I plan

01:38.625 --> 01:40.792
to eat pastrami all week,

01:40.834 --> 01:42.959
since she's staying with us

01:40.834 --> 01:42.959
while her parents are away.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.750
- My plan is

01:43.000 --> 01:45.750
to never have a plan.

01:45.792 --> 01:50.083
Like, earlier, when I saw

01:45.792 --> 01:50.083
that pastrami in the fridge,

01:50.125 --> 01:51.709
I didn't plan

01:50.125 --> 01:51.709
on eating it all.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.667
I just did.

01:54.709 --> 01:58.458
- Well, while you drifters

01:54.709 --> 01:58.458
are focused on cured meats,

01:58.500 --> 02:00.667
I'm going to make

01:58.500 --> 02:00.667
something of my life.

02:00.709 --> 02:03.542
Mae, let's go edit that video.

02:03.583 --> 02:07.083
- I may have sent it

02:03.583 --> 02:07.083
right after you fell.

02:07.125 --> 02:09.291
- What do you mean

02:07.125 --> 02:09.291
by "may," Mae?

02:09.333 --> 02:12.166
- I mean, I did, did.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.542
- That's okay.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.542
No sweat.

02:14.583 --> 02:15.875
Ahh!

02:15.917 --> 02:19.166

02:38.291 --> 02:41.792
Industries getting back to me?

02:41.834 --> 02:43.792
Maybe it's because

02:41.834 --> 02:43.792
they didn't get my video.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.542
- Or maybe it's because

02:43.834 --> 02:46.542
they did.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.709
- You're right.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.709
Millions of kids probably

02:48.750 --> 02:50.709
sent in videos.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.709
Why am I special?

02:50.750 --> 02:52.041
- You're not.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.041
- Totally average.

02:52.083 --> 02:54.166
- You're not even the best quad.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.959
- No, this is where

02:54.208 --> 02:55.959
you're supportive

02:56.000 --> 02:57.875
and say the opposite

02:56.000 --> 02:57.875
of those things.

02:57.917 --> 03:01.417
- Well, I guess that just

02:57.917 --> 03:01.417
wasn't part of<i> our</i> life plan.

03:01.458 --> 03:05.458
- Yeah, we're just a bunch

03:01.458 --> 03:05.458
of aimless drifters.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.333
- Hey, pocket pastrami!

03:09.375 --> 03:11.208
Nope, just pocket.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.458
- Ugh, he's never

03:11.250 --> 03:14.458
gonna email me.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.875
[beep]

03:15.917 --> 03:18.375
He just emailed me!

03:18.417 --> 03:22.333
Lonny Tusk, the CEO

03:18.417 --> 03:22.333
of Rocket Science Industries,

03:22.375 --> 03:25.583
says he just landed in Denver,

03:22.375 --> 03:25.583
and he's coming here!

03:25.625 --> 03:26.625
- Actually, I'm already here.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.750
- Ah!

03:28.792 --> 03:32.000
Whoa, I--

03:28.792 --> 03:32.000
I just got your email.

03:32.041 --> 03:33.709
How'd you get here so fast?

03:33.750 --> 03:35.667
Jetpack?

03:33.750 --> 03:35.667
Hyper-loop?

03:35.709 --> 03:38.375
Molecular restructuring

03:35.709 --> 03:38.375
transporter?

03:38.417 --> 03:40.959
- Maybe he forgot

03:38.417 --> 03:40.959
to hit Send earlier.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.542
- Dicky, he's Lonny Tusk,

03:42.583 --> 03:45.250
the world's most brilliant

03:42.583 --> 03:45.250
rocket scientist.

03:45.291 --> 03:47.000
He didn't forget to hit Send.

03:47.041 --> 03:50.125
- Dude, I totally

03:47.041 --> 03:50.125
forgot to hit Send.

03:50.166 --> 03:51.917
- Don't worry,

03:50.166 --> 03:51.917
I do it all the time.

03:51.959 --> 03:55.291
- Mm-hmm, anyway, Ricky,

03:51.959 --> 03:55.291
I came to offer you

03:55.333 --> 03:57.792
a space in my Junior Astronaut

03:55.333 --> 03:57.792
Training Program.

03:57.834 --> 03:59.417
- Yes!

03:57.834 --> 03:59.417
- Along with your brothers

03:59.458 --> 04:01.959
and sister.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.959
- No!

04:02.000 --> 04:04.375
- When I saw your video,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.375
it gave me an idea.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.542
We've put people in space,

04:04.417 --> 04:06.542
monkeys in space.

04:06.583 --> 04:08.709
We've even put

04:06.583 --> 04:08.709
sea monkeys in space.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.333
But never quadruplets.

04:11.375 --> 04:14.709
- Quads in space?

04:14.750 --> 04:18.333
Oh, no, you don't even want

04:14.750 --> 04:18.333
to put us in a minivan together.

04:18.375 --> 04:21.917
- He's right.

04:18.375 --> 04:21.917
They made my dad quit car pool.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.625
- No, this is perfect.

04:23.667 --> 04:26.583
My new space module

04:23.667 --> 04:26.583
requires four people to operate.

04:26.625 --> 04:28.458
And what better four people

04:26.625 --> 04:28.458
than you?

04:28.500 --> 04:30.291
- Any four people.

04:30.333 --> 04:33.667
- But you four are used to

04:30.333 --> 04:33.667
operating in tight quarters.

04:33.709 --> 04:35.125
You shared a womb.

04:35.166 --> 04:37.208
- Uh, for a while,

04:35.166 --> 04:37.208
but Dawn moved out, like,

04:37.250 --> 04:38.959
two years ago

04:37.250 --> 04:38.959
and got her own womb.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
- And then there's that.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.250
Look, Lonny, I've prepared.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.500
I have a plan.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.500
They don't.

04:48.542 --> 04:50.208
They don't even

04:48.542 --> 04:50.208
want to go to space.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.500
- You guys wanna go to space?

04:51.542 --> 04:52.750
- Yeah.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.750
- Sounds fun.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.000
- Why not?

04:52.792 --> 04:55.000
- Ooh, "why not?"

04:55.041 --> 04:56.000
Now, that's a great question.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.458
You could learn a lot from him.

04:57.500 --> 05:01.125
I got where I am today

04:57.500 --> 05:01.125
by asking "why not?"

05:01.166 --> 05:04.291
- Okay, why not...

05:01.166 --> 05:04.291
just take me?

05:04.333 --> 05:05.959
- Well, because

05:04.333 --> 05:05.959
it's my spaceship,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.667
and I want to take quadruplets.

05:07.709 --> 05:10.375
So either get with the program

05:10.417 --> 05:13.208
or you're not

05:10.417 --> 05:13.208
getting in the program.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.041
- I think you know

05:13.250 --> 05:16.041
what you need to say.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.625
- Why not?

05:16.083 --> 05:18.625
- Yes, that's the spirit!

05:18.667 --> 05:20.125
Oh, this is gonna be so cool.

05:20.166 --> 05:22.750
I'm gonna shoot you guys

05:20.166 --> 05:22.750
into space.

05:22.792 --> 05:27.000
- Well if we're going to space,

05:22.792 --> 05:27.000
we better practice our moonwalk.

05:28.834 --> 05:30.625
- Are you sure

05:28.834 --> 05:30.625
the question isn't "why?"

05:30.667 --> 05:32.834
- Yep, it's definitely

05:30.667 --> 05:32.834
"why not?"

20:59.250 --> 21:01.500
<i>Kids, are you all right?</i>

21:01.542 --> 21:03.709
- Ricky, you did it!

21:03.750 --> 21:04.959
- Ricky did it?

21:05.000 --> 21:08.208
My hands are covered

21:05.000 --> 21:08.208
in sock juice!

21:08.250 --> 21:10.709
- Mom, Dad, we're okay.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.750
I mean, we're in space,

21:10.750 --> 21:13.750
but we're okay.

21:13.792 --> 21:16.542
<i>- Well, you're not in space.</i>

21:13.792 --> 21:16.542
<i>You're just in a simulator.</i>

21:16.583 --> 21:18.875
- I touched Ricky's wet socks

21:16.583 --> 21:18.875
for nothing?

21:18.917 --> 21:20.792
- I have a condition!

21:20.834 --> 21:22.667
<i>- Now let me talk you through</i>

21:20.834 --> 21:22.667

21:22.709 --> 21:24.417

21:24.458 --> 21:26.000
<i>First, flick</i>

21:24.458 --> 21:26.000

21:26.041 --> 21:29.000
<i>It'll turn off the zero gravity</i>

<i>simulation control.</i>

21:29.041 --> 21:32.250
- Wait, look at where we are.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.041
You wanted to go

21:32.291 --> 21:34.041
to space, Ricky.

21:34.083 --> 21:35.667
And we're kind of already here.

21:35.709 --> 21:38.250
So why not enjoy it?

21:38.291 --> 21:40.709
- Why not?

21:40.750 --> 21:44.375
Even though it's not real,

21:40.750 --> 21:44.375
it's still beautiful.

21:44.417 --> 21:47.792
- In the end,

21:44.417 --> 21:47.792
you did good, Ricky.

21:47.834 --> 21:49.542
- We all did.

21:49.583 --> 21:53.041
Maybe it's okay to not have

21:49.583 --> 21:53.041
a life plan just yet.

21:53.083 --> 21:57.166
Maybe it's okay to just drift

21:53.083 --> 21:57.166
aimlessly for a little while.

21:57.208 --> 22:00.000
- Well, I'm really

21:57.208 --> 22:00.000
enjoying this view.
