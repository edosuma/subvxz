his parent or grandparent,

11:30.023 --> 11:31.555

11:31.591 --> 11:32.857

footage.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.726

from the manager?

11:34.795 --> 11:37.395

working in multiple homes.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.997
Suggested not too subtly that
she had brought the virus here.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.066

- Hmm.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.172
What kind of pesticides
do you use?

27:55.241 --> 27:58.909
- Uh... Atrazine,
but I never spray here.

27:58.911 --> 28:02.579

- Mice.

28:02.648 --> 28:05.415

if you use too much mulch.

It's a blood thinner.

28:32.444 --> 28:35.612
- But why would my bobby
eat poison?

28:35.614 --> 28:36.813
- It's water-soluble.

It, it... Could've bled
into the soil,

28:38.818 --> 28:40.517

She ingested it.

28:42.621 --> 28:45.422
Maybe there was enough
to accumulate in her system.

28:45.424 --> 28:48.558

my own granddaughter.
