00:01.070 --> 00:02.210
WOMAN: Previously
on "The Practice"...

00:02.210 --> 00:04.180
- Look, I've tried to fit in,

00:04.180 --> 00:07.070
and I realize it's probably
my fault that I don't.

00:07.070 --> 00:09.050
But let's just all admit
it's not working.

00:09.050 --> 00:11.060
- I won't admit that.
I think you've been doing great.

00:11.060 --> 00:13.200
- You're the only one
who's been nice--and Jimmy,

00:13.200 --> 00:17.130
sometimes Rebecca, and Ellenor
when she's not riled.

00:17.130 --> 00:20.170
- You're working out, I promise.

00:20.170 --> 00:22.130
- There's a medical bag
on the floor right here.

00:22.130 --> 00:23.220
- Ha, ha.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.220
[all scream]

00:25.220 --> 00:28.210
- Gotcha good, didn't I.
- Ellenor!

00:28.210 --> 00:31.090
- It was a joke,
for God's sakes!

00:31.090 --> 00:33.050
BOBBY: You have no legal right
to do anything.

00:33.050 --> 00:34.220
- Legal--what about moral right?

00:34.220 --> 00:36.080
- That oath
you're about to take tomorrow

00:36.080 --> 00:38.050
has nothing to do
with moral right--

00:38.050 --> 00:40.030
- Oh, please, spoken just
like a true defense attorney.

00:40.030 --> 00:42.020
- Which you are on this case.

00:42.020 --> 00:44.040
My New Year's resolution
was to move ahead.

00:44.040 --> 00:47.060
- And everybody certainly thinks
that was mine, don't they?

00:47.060 --> 00:48.130
- I'm not going anywhere.

00:48.130 --> 00:50.030
I'd rather fire you.

00:50.030 --> 00:51.230
- You can't just fire me.
I'm a partner.

00:51.230 --> 00:55.160
- Yeah, you are--mine.

01:02.040 --> 01:05.140
- Okay, manicure 3:00,
pedicure 3:30,

01:05.140 --> 01:07.040
facial 4:15,

01:07.040 --> 01:10.000
full-body 5:00,
then we go to hair.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.230
- I have been
so waiting for this day.

01:11.230 --> 01:13.120
You still think we can
get out by lunch?

01:13.120 --> 01:14.230
- I've just got my PC
on the boat guy.

01:14.230 --> 01:16.190
I should be done by 11:00.
- Jimmy's case?

01:16.190 --> 01:18.160
- Yeah, we've already
made a deal on manslaughter,

01:18.160 --> 01:20.060
pending probable cause, so...

01:20.060 --> 01:23.040
You think I should
have a softer look?

01:23.040 --> 01:24.180
- What?

01:24.180 --> 01:26.180
- I'm thinking of going softer
with my hair.

01:26.180 --> 01:28.200
I'm told juries
are finding me a little harsh.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.030
You think I should go softer?

01:31.030 --> 01:34.130
- Well, Helen, I mean,
your style is kind of, you know,

01:34.130 --> 01:35.150
queen bitch killer bee.

01:35.150 --> 01:37.190
Doesn't harsh go with that?

01:37.190 --> 01:40.120
- Why, yes, Lindsay,
harsh would go with that.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.050
- You win almost all
of your cases; what's to change?

01:43.050 --> 01:45.080
- Well, I wouldn't mind getting
asked out on a date.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.150
- But if you go
with a softer look,

01:46.150 --> 01:47.230
you might get hit on
by nice guys.

01:47.230 --> 01:50.060
- Yeah?
- You don't want a nice guy.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.150
You only like crazy guys,

01:51.150 --> 01:53.050
or at least a guy
that can make you crazy.

01:53.050 --> 01:54.140
- That is so untrue.

01:54.140 --> 01:56.010
- Name one guy
you've been with

01:56.010 --> 01:57.090
that didn't have some dark,
twisted--

01:57.090 --> 01:58.100
- Bobby.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.160
- And it died quickly.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.000
- Not because he was
a nice guy,

02:01.000 --> 02:02.050
because
you were sleeping with him.

02:02.050 --> 02:03.190
- I wasn't sleeping with him.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.080
That was before you, Helen.
We got together before--

02:05.080 --> 02:06.080
- Oh, not much,
you weren't sleeping with him.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.080
I like nice guys.

02:07.080 --> 02:10.000
- Helen, you like twisted guys.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.150
- Is that really true?

02:11.150 --> 02:13.020
- Well...

02:13.020 --> 02:15.160
- You think I should
see somebody about it?

02:15.160 --> 02:16.220
- You might.

02:18.140 --> 02:20.230
- Know any dark,
demented, twisted shrinks?

02:23.140 --> 02:26.150
<i>[funky music]</i>

02:26.150 --> 02:34.130
<i>♪ ♪</i>

03:11.190 --> 03:13.000
- Take you a day, two tops.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.220
- Okay.
- Nice Lujack, Eugene.

03:14.220 --> 03:16.130
- It's not a Lujack.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.110
- What's a Lujack?
- Lindsay turfed it to me.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.050
She's having a maintenance day.

03:20.050 --> 03:22.010
- What's going on?
- Oh, Lindsay's maintaining.

03:22.010 --> 03:23.190
She turfed a case to Eugene.
Now he's Lujacking Rebecca.

03:23.190 --> 03:25.130
- I can't find my day planner.

03:25.130 --> 03:27.000
- What's a Lujack?
- It's when you dump a case

03:27.000 --> 03:28.120
you don't want
onto somebody else.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.200
- It's a prelim.
It's good experience.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.070
- Lujack.
- I left it right here

03:31.070 --> 03:32.220
on my desk--
- That's not even a word.

03:32.220 --> 03:34.120
Show me where it says
"Lujack" in the dictionary.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.110
- It's okay.
I want to do this.

03:36.110 --> 03:38.030
- Let me guess.
This is a drug prelim.

03:38.030 --> 03:40.100
- Possessions
of a controlled substance.

03:40.100 --> 03:41.110
- Lujack.

03:41.110 --> 03:42.200
- Where you going?

03:42.200 --> 03:44.140
- Oh, PC
on my lifejacket killer.

03:44.140 --> 03:47.030
- I thought you plead out.
- Only assuming they make PC.

03:55.030 --> 03:57.160
- What?

03:57.160 --> 03:59.110
What?

03:59.110 --> 04:02.220
- Don't you think that's
a little brisk for January?

04:02.220 --> 04:04.050
- Oh, this?

04:04.050 --> 04:05.200
Yeah, I read an article
that, you know,

04:05.200 --> 04:07.050
sexy-looking receptionists

04:07.050 --> 04:09.150
actually
help lawyers land clients.

04:09.150 --> 04:12.160
So I thought, what the hell?
We'll see.

04:18.029 --> 04:20.200
What?
- Well, there's sexy, Lucy,

04:20.200 --> 04:23.110
and then there's, uh--

04:23.110 --> 04:25.090
- Slut?
- I'm not a slut.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.000
- I didn't say you were one--
- All right--

04:27.000 --> 04:29.180
- Yeah,
I can show you the article.

04:29.180 --> 04:32.180
Donnell, Young, Dole
&amp; Slut--Frutt.

04:32.180 --> 04:36.220
Hey, slow down, bub,
I'm only using one ear.

04:36.220 --> 04:38.050
Bite my head off.

04:38.050 --> 04:40.040
Bobby, he says he's a friend.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.180
- Hello? Ted.

04:44.020 --> 04:48.040
Okay, okay, slow down.

04:48.040 --> 04:49.100
When?

04:50.180 --> 04:54.120
Okay, o-okay, um,

04:54.120 --> 04:56.020
are you sure she's dead?

04:58.090 --> 05:00.210
All right.
No, don't call anybody.

05:00.210 --> 05:03.220
I'll be there--
it'll take me 20 minutes.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.040
Just wait right there.

05:06.150 --> 05:07.190
- Joey Heric, right?

05:07.190 --> 05:09.060
He's dating again.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.100
- Not Joey Heric.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.190
Eugene, you free?

05:12.190 --> 05:14.030
- I can be.

05:14.030 --> 05:16.040
- I'll fill you in on the way.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.080
- Well, what about me?

05:17.080 --> 05:18.160
Who's gonna fill me in?

05:34.140 --> 05:36.210
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:36.210 --> 05:39.190
- Where's Julie?
- She's up in her room.

05:39.190 --> 05:42.050
- She okay?
- I don't know.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.040
How--

05:44.040 --> 05:49.110
- Mary, how you doing?

05:52.030 --> 05:57.080
- I can't--I can't believe
this is happening.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.140
- Okay.

05:59.230 --> 06:01.190
Where's, uh--

06:01.190 --> 06:03.010
- In the kitchen.

06:29.050 --> 06:31.160
We didn't even know
she was pregnant.

06:33.110 --> 06:36.090
We didn't even--
- Okay, Ted, Ted, have a seat.

06:41.020 --> 06:42.190
- We didn't even
know she was pregnant--

06:42.190 --> 06:43.210
- Okay, okay.

07:01.060 --> 07:03.120
- It makes no sense
to waive probable cause,

07:03.120 --> 07:04.190
so I want to go through with it.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.130
But it's pretty much pro forma.

07:06.130 --> 07:08.160
We'll cop to manslaughter
right after.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.140
- And you think three years?

07:10.140 --> 07:13.100
- No record, good behavior,
I don't see any reason why not.

07:15.190 --> 07:17.000
- You're a good lawyer, right?

07:18.120 --> 07:19.180
- I run hot and cold.

07:23.050 --> 07:24.130
- I was just walking
down the street,

07:24.130 --> 07:26.050
minding my own business.

07:26.050 --> 07:30.070
And that cop, he just
stopped me--no reason.

07:30.070 --> 07:32.020
- But the drugs were yours.

07:32.020 --> 07:35.220
- Two tiny packets in the watch
pocket--no way he could tell.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.230
- Well, for the prelim,
all the have to establish

07:37.230 --> 07:39.190
is that a crime
has been committed--

07:39.190 --> 07:42.180
- But they can't just go around
searching people for no reason.

07:42.180 --> 07:45.000
Can't you file one of them
squash motions?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.070
- Motion to quash.

07:46.070 --> 07:47.220
- Yeah, file one of them.

07:47.220 --> 07:49.130
- We can do that
for the trial court.

07:49.130 --> 07:51.040
With the prelim--

07:51.040 --> 07:53.150
- Ms. Washington,
you got to make this go away.

07:53.150 --> 07:57.130
With my priors, I'm facing
serious time here.

07:57.130 --> 08:00.060
- Wouldn't that be incentive
to give up the drug life?

08:00.060 --> 08:03.060
- That cop stopped me 'cause
I was in the wrong place

08:03.060 --> 08:04.210
at the wrong time

08:04.210 --> 08:07.060
with the wrong color skin.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.220
You got to help me.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.170
- She gave birth
in the middle of the night,

08:17.170 --> 08:20.010
in her room.

08:20.010 --> 08:22.100
- She was alone?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.220
- Yes.

08:23.220 --> 08:25.180
- And you didn't hear it?

08:25.180 --> 08:27.210
- No.

08:27.210 --> 08:31.180
God, I still can't believe--
it's like I'm talking about--

08:31.180 --> 08:35.080
- When did you first
see the baby?

08:35.080 --> 08:36.179
- This morning.

08:36.179 --> 08:39.130
I was coming down the stairs,

08:39.130 --> 08:44.000
and I suddenly heard a scream
from her room,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.180
like I've never
heard her scream.

08:46.180 --> 08:49.230
I ran back up.

08:49.230 --> 08:52.160
She was holding the baby,

08:52.160 --> 08:55.030
trying to make it breathe.

08:58.030 --> 09:00.090
It wasn't breathing.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.050
- I need to talk
to your daughter.

09:07.070 --> 09:09.100
MAN: We first pulled him
on board.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.050
- The defendant?
MAN: Yes.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.160
He said there had been some kind

09:12.160 --> 09:14.150
of explosion
on his fishing boat.

09:14.150 --> 09:16.190
It sank, and he and his partner,

09:16.190 --> 09:19.020
they had been in the water
for almost three hours.

09:19.020 --> 09:20.190
- Did he say anything else?

09:20.190 --> 09:22.130
MAN: He said his partner
was still out there.

09:22.130 --> 09:24.200
And then one of the crew members
of my boat spotted him,

09:24.200 --> 09:26.210
and we pulled him on board.

09:26.210 --> 09:28.210
- Could you describe
his condition?

09:28.210 --> 09:30.020
- Bad.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.050
He was bleeding
from a head wound.

09:31.050 --> 09:32.210
He was near death.

09:32.210 --> 09:34.230
HELEN: Did he tell you
how he got the head wound?

09:34.230 --> 09:37.040
- Objection.
- Overruled.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.190
MAN: He said the defendant
wanted the life jacket

09:39.190 --> 09:42.130
and that the defendant
hit him over the head

09:42.130 --> 09:44.180
with a piece of wood
and removed the life jacket

09:44.180 --> 09:46.060
and put it on himself.

09:46.060 --> 09:48.090
HELEN: And did he say
anything else?

09:48.090 --> 09:50.080
- No, he got kind of groggy.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.170
He died as we were
heading back to shore.

09:53.170 --> 09:55.230
- The parties stipulate
that the cause of death

09:55.230 --> 09:59.020
for Mr. Terrence was a hematoma
caused by a fractured skull.

09:59.020 --> 10:00.030
That's all.

10:02.050 --> 10:03.170
- Mr. Berluti.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.010
- He said Mr. Forbes
hit him with the wood?

10:08.010 --> 10:10.060
- He referred to him as David.

10:10.060 --> 10:12.170
"David hit me and stole
my life jacket."

10:12.170 --> 10:14.050
That was basically it.

10:14.050 --> 10:17.210
- Okay, I think that's all,
Your Honor.

10:17.210 --> 10:20.080
- Your Honor, one second.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.030
I'm cocounsel with Mr. Berluti.

10:22.030 --> 10:23.040
I'd like to confer.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.100
- Make it quick.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.000
- Is that their whole case?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.130
- Well, they removed fragments
from his head

10:29.130 --> 10:31.060
that matches the wood
he was clinging to.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.030
- Well, he could've got hit
during the explosion.

10:33.030 --> 10:34.090
Has your guy talked?

10:34.090 --> 10:36.000
- No.
- He's it?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.130
- Well, three others on board
also heard what he--

10:37.130 --> 10:39.050
- It's hearsay.

10:39.050 --> 10:41.190
- Dying declaration, Lindsay.
- Can I try something?

10:41.190 --> 10:44.120
- Be my guest.
- Who's she?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.030
- Mr. Brown,

10:46.030 --> 10:49.020
when you pulled
Mr. Terrence on board,

10:49.020 --> 10:50.210
did he say anything
about his condition?

10:50.210 --> 10:53.110
- Just that he knew
he was hurt real bad,

10:53.110 --> 10:54.140
pointing at his head.

10:54.140 --> 10:56.010
- Did he say anything to you

10:56.010 --> 10:58.040
that indicated he knew
he was going to die?

10:58.040 --> 10:59.140
- I think he knew pretty--

10:59.140 --> 11:00.210
LINDSAY: I'm not asking
what you think.

11:00.210 --> 11:02.190
Did he indicate
any knowledge on his part

11:02.190 --> 11:04.220
that he was about to die?

11:04.220 --> 11:06.100
- Not directly.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.150
LINDSAY: And did you say
anything to him?

11:07.150 --> 11:09.120
Did you try to comfort him?

11:09.120 --> 11:11.000
- Yes.
LINDSAY: Like how?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.090
- You know, "Hang in there.

11:12.090 --> 11:13.220
We'll get you to the doctor."

11:13.220 --> 11:15.040
LINDSAY: So you were trying
to give him hope?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.160
MAN: Yes.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.060
We certainly didn't tell him
to give up.

11:18.060 --> 11:20.140
- So it's possible
he thought he might live.

11:20.140 --> 11:22.080
- I guess, sure.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.130
- Your Honor, I move to strike
all of this testimony.

11:24.130 --> 11:26.140
It's hearsay;
the dying declaration exception

11:26.140 --> 11:29.050
doesn't apply unless
the declarant knows he's dying.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.150
They haven't made
a showing that he did.

11:30.150 --> 11:31.160
- I think he did know.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.020
- Excuse me, sir.

11:37.160 --> 11:41.220
- Ms. Gamble,
have you got anybody else?

11:41.220 --> 11:43.140
- Do I need anybody else?

11:43.140 --> 11:46.160
- Well, I wouldn't stop here.

11:46.160 --> 11:49.080
- I can get another witness
in here after lunch, Your Honor.

11:49.080 --> 11:53.160
- We're adjourned until then.
- Nice.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.210
- Helen,
we have to take the shot.

11:55.210 --> 11:57.070
- There goes our manicure,
Lindsay.

11:57.070 --> 11:59.160
We will be lucky now
to make the facial.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.020
See ya.

12:13.150 --> 12:16.230
- The cop who arrested you?
I did some checking.

12:16.230 --> 12:18.220
He has had a few
of his cases kicked.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.060
He's a little aggressive.

12:20.060 --> 12:22.070
- This is what I'm telling you.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.150
A client of mine got busted
by this guy once.

12:24.150 --> 12:26.120
- Yes, maybe
we can call your clients

12:26.120 --> 12:28.020
as character witnesses.

12:28.020 --> 12:31.000
- Ms. Washington,
are you gonna fight for me

12:31.000 --> 12:32.120
or not?

12:35.140 --> 12:38.220
- Nobody knew you were pregnant?

12:38.220 --> 12:40.130
- No.

12:40.130 --> 12:43.080
- You never went
to the doctor--nobody?

12:43.080 --> 12:46.020
- I just wore baggy clothes,
which--

12:46.020 --> 12:48.040
- What about the father?

12:48.040 --> 12:52.040
- He was a guy I dated
for a couple of months.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.100
I haven't told him.

12:54.100 --> 12:59.020
- So last night, you gave birth
all by yourself?

12:59.020 --> 13:01.080
- Yes.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.230
She came out okay,

13:03.230 --> 13:09.020
and I was gonna drop her off
at the hospital this morning.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.040
When I heard Daddy's footsteps,

13:11.040 --> 13:13.090
I thought he was
coming to my room,

13:13.090 --> 13:16.220
and so I put her
in the closet, in a box,

13:16.220 --> 13:21.110
and threw some coats
and stuff over the top.

13:21.110 --> 13:24.210
I was afraid she'd cry
and Daddy would hear.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.150
It was less
than a minute, I think.

13:30.150 --> 13:33.120
- How many coats
did you put on top?

13:33.120 --> 13:35.020
- I don't know.

13:35.020 --> 13:37.180
I just threw a bunch
of clothes over the top

13:37.180 --> 13:42.130
'cause I didn't want
him to hear her.

13:42.130 --> 13:47.040
I didn't leave her there
that long, and then--

13:47.040 --> 13:50.050
- Okay, honey, it's okay.

13:50.050 --> 13:51.170
It's okay, sweetheart.

13:51.170 --> 13:53.130
- Bobby.

13:53.130 --> 13:54.180
MARY: You're gonna be all right.

13:59.200 --> 14:03.160
- I can't let this destroy
the rest of her life.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.150
I need you to advise me.

14:07.170 --> 14:10.230
If we don't go forward
with this,

14:10.230 --> 14:12.220
what do I need to know?

14:26.150 --> 14:28.160
- Bec.
- Jimmy, have you seen Eugene?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.230
He said he'd be here
to back me up.

14:29.230 --> 14:31.110
I got a prelim
in about 20 minutes.

14:31.110 --> 14:32.170
- The drug case.
- Yeah.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.060
Have you heard of a cop
named Alan Gill?

14:34.060 --> 14:35.060
- He's the arresting?

14:35.060 --> 14:36.170
- You know him?

14:36.170 --> 14:38.040
- He's the guy
Dershowitz had in mind

14:38.040 --> 14:39.220
when he said all cops
are trained to lie.

14:39.220 --> 14:41.040
- Great.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.070
- Rebecca,
this is just a prelim.

14:42.070 --> 14:43.100
You've tried cases.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.190
- I've never done a prelim,

14:44.190 --> 14:47.060
and my client
faces a lot of time.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.040
Eugene said he'd be here.
First he Kojaks me.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.150
Then he doesn't show up?
- Lujack.

14:50.150 --> 14:52.010
- Yeah, well,
whatever--something jacked.

14:52.010 --> 14:53.140
That much I know.
I've been jacked.

14:53.140 --> 14:55.120
And now I'm going up
against some cagey cop

14:55.120 --> 14:57.030
who's got more experience
in there than me.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.050
- Calm down.

14:58.050 --> 14:59.140
Let's find a room.

14:59.140 --> 15:01.230
We'll do a little run-through.

15:01.230 --> 15:03.160
- Okay.

15:03.160 --> 15:05.040
- Accident or not,

15:05.040 --> 15:07.020
it's a potential homicide
investigation.

15:07.020 --> 15:09.030
If you don't contact the police,
you could be subject

15:09.030 --> 15:12.030
to obstruction of justice
charges--maybe even accessory.

15:12.030 --> 15:14.200
- If they find out.

15:19.110 --> 15:22.210
- Yes, if they find out.

15:22.210 --> 15:25.110
- What's done is done.

15:25.110 --> 15:29.070
But if this becomes public--

15:29.070 --> 15:30.220
She's 16.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.150
The investigation alone--

15:32.150 --> 15:36.030
- Ted, my advice
is to call the police.

15:36.030 --> 15:38.150
- If it's an accident,
like Julie says--

15:38.150 --> 15:40.060
- There's still gonna
be an investigation.

15:40.060 --> 15:43.120
Look, and even if it's dismissed
as an accident,

15:43.120 --> 15:45.220
this is gonna be on newscasts
all over the country.

15:45.220 --> 15:49.150
"Teenager buries baby
in closet."

15:49.150 --> 15:52.020
I'm not gonna let my daughter
be ruined by this.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.140
I'm not gonna let that happen.

15:56.140 --> 15:59.020
- You're talking publicity
as worst-case scenario.

15:59.020 --> 16:01.010
Ted, that's not the worst.

16:01.010 --> 16:03.010
Worst is criminal prosecution.

16:03.010 --> 16:06.010
If she doesn't come forward
and the police tumble to this,

16:06.010 --> 16:09.140
they will suspect her of murder.

16:09.140 --> 16:12.110
The only way they buy accident
is for her to come clean.

16:15.090 --> 16:20.230
- All right,
let me ask you this.

16:20.230 --> 16:24.000
An autopsy
right now--no bruises.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.160
They'll probably conclude
accidental suffocation, right?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.190
- If that's what happened.

16:29.190 --> 16:33.060
- If the body
were disposed of

16:33.060 --> 16:37.020
but discovered
a month or so later,

16:37.020 --> 16:40.090
would it still reflect
what happened?

16:40.090 --> 16:44.010
The question I'm getting at--
would we be burying evidence

16:44.010 --> 16:48.090
that might clear us
if we ever got caught?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.040
- First of all,
that's a medical question.

16:50.040 --> 16:54.190
Second, I'm not gonna
advise you, in any way,

16:54.190 --> 16:59.020
to bury or dispose of the baby.

16:59.020 --> 17:02.030
<i>[tense music]</i>

17:02.030 --> 17:07.160

17:07.160 --> 17:10.040
- I need to talk to my wife.

17:10.040 --> 17:16.020
<i>♪ ♪</i>

17:16.020 --> 17:18.200
- You just had to make me
bring in another witness.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.099
- All right.
- Just keep in mind,

17:20.099 --> 17:22.000
the longer you cross-examine,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.020
the longer you cut
into your herbal wrap.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.109
- Yes, I actually
have that written down.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.180
- Oh, funny--had to have
another witness.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.160
- All right.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.000
- And, Officer, isn't it true

17:32.000 --> 17:33.150
that when you saw
Clarence Barnett,

17:33.150 --> 17:35.130
he was just walking
down the street?

17:35.130 --> 17:39.040
- And then I observed him make
a furtive gesture.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.150
- What?

17:40.150 --> 17:42.110
No cop is gonna use
a word like "furtive."

17:42.110 --> 17:45.000
- Sometimes they use language
right out of case law

17:45.000 --> 17:46.170
to make sure the arrest sticks.

17:46.170 --> 17:48.010
- Well, a judge would know
that's what he's doing.

17:48.010 --> 17:49.080
- Rebecca,
all the judge wants

17:49.080 --> 17:51.010
is an excuse
to find probable cause

17:51.010 --> 17:53.140
and pass it on
to the trial court.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.070
- Okay.

17:56.070 --> 17:59.030
- Define "furtive."

17:59.030 --> 18:01.210
- Well, it basically
means "sneaky."

18:01.210 --> 18:03.060
- Basically?

18:03.060 --> 18:04.210
You don't even
know what it means?

18:04.210 --> 18:06.040
- I said "sneaky."
- You don't know what it means.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.190
- You want me
to help you or not?

18:07.190 --> 18:09.100
- I'm talking to you
like you're the cop.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.210
- Oh, right.
Go ahead.

18:11.210 --> 18:14.060
- So you stopped him
based on "sneaky."

18:14.060 --> 18:15.180
- Yes.

18:15.180 --> 18:18.000
I thought he might be
reaching for a weapon,

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
so for my own protection,

18:20.000 --> 18:21.180
I conducted a pat-down search.

18:21.180 --> 18:22.220
- You conducted a pat-down
for weapons?

18:22.220 --> 18:24.160
- Yes, I did.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.130
- But you didn't feel anything
that felt like a weapon.

18:26.130 --> 18:30.050
- I felt a suspicious bulge
in his front jeans pocket.

18:30.050 --> 18:34.050
- And you thought what was in
that little pocket was a weapon?

18:34.050 --> 18:36.230
- I thought
it might be a weapon.

18:36.230 --> 18:39.020
- That's a lie. You're a liar.
- Oh, you--you can't say that--

18:39.020 --> 18:40.190
- A little packet
the size of a thumbnail?

18:40.190 --> 18:41.230
- You can't call him a liar.

18:41.230 --> 18:43.080
- If he says that, he is.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.000
- This cop is an experienced
witness.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.090
- Experienced liar.
- You can't call him a liar.

18:46.090 --> 18:47.110
- Okay, "You sneaky,
furtive bastard,"

18:47.110 --> 18:49.130
how about that?

18:49.130 --> 18:51.020
- Come on, Jimmy.
We're on.

18:55.020 --> 18:57.040
- He knew he was dying.
- You're sure?

18:57.040 --> 18:59.070
- He had this look in his eye.
He knew.

18:59.070 --> 19:01.020
And he said,
"David did it.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.210
He hit me to steal the jacket."

19:02.210 --> 19:04.220
- When you say
he knew he was dying--

19:04.220 --> 19:07.090
- Well, I'm no psychiatrist,
but when he said,

19:07.090 --> 19:09.200
"David did it," it seemed
like a dying declaration.

19:13.070 --> 19:14.170
JUDGE: Mr. Berluti?

19:17.070 --> 19:19.040
- "Dying declaration."

19:19.040 --> 19:21.130
You ever hear that term
from the district attorney?

19:21.130 --> 19:23.020
- Objection.
JUDGE: Overruled.

19:23.020 --> 19:26.110
- She ever say that term,
"dying declaration"?

19:26.110 --> 19:28.140
- I think
maybe I heard her say it, yes.

19:28.140 --> 19:30.210
- Did she tell you
that term had special meaning

19:30.210 --> 19:32.160
as far as the rules of evidence?

19:32.160 --> 19:34.190
- Objection.
- Overruled.

19:34.190 --> 19:37.140
- Did she give you
any instructions

19:37.140 --> 19:39.130
for the purpose
of this testimony?

19:39.130 --> 19:41.140
- Work product.
JUDGE: Overruled.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.100
What did she tell you?

19:43.100 --> 19:46.030
- That it was important that
Mr. Terrence knew he was dying.

19:46.030 --> 19:48.130
Otherwise, what he said to us
would be inadmissible.

19:50.110 --> 19:54.040
- Thank you.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.230
- Did I ever tell you
to do anything

19:55.230 --> 19:57.210
but tell the truth?
- No.

19:57.210 --> 19:59.170
- And is it
your truthful testimony

19:59.170 --> 20:02.090
that Mr. Terrence believed
he was dying when he uttered,

20:02.090 --> 20:03.150
"David did it"?

20:03.150 --> 20:05.140
- Absolutely.
HELEN: Thank you.

20:08.060 --> 20:10.040
- I got another idea.
- What?

20:10.040 --> 20:11.210
- [whispering indistinctly]

20:15.230 --> 20:19.140
- Your Honor, the defense
would like to call David Forbes.

20:19.140 --> 20:21.060
- Really?

20:21.060 --> 20:23.180
- We'd just like a 20-minute
recess to confer.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.110
- Okay, back in 20.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.150
- We can't give them any advice
on how to dispose of a body.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.040
- I know that.
- That's where they're heading.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.140
I can tell--
- I can see that, Eugene.

20:36.140 --> 20:37.230
You heard me tell them.

20:37.230 --> 20:39.100
- We also can't start
giving them odds

20:39.100 --> 20:41.050
on whether or not
they'll get caught.

20:41.050 --> 20:43.110
That's borderline accessory.
- How do you figure?

20:43.110 --> 20:44.230
- Well, if we tell them,
chances are,

20:44.230 --> 20:46.120
they won't get caught,
that amounts

20:46.120 --> 20:49.080
to encouragement--
aiding and abetting.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.000
We got to stay clear of that.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.080
Now, I realize
this guy's your friend,

20:52.080 --> 20:54.140
but we got
to cover our asses too.

20:54.140 --> 20:55.150
- Yeah.

20:57.170 --> 21:00.190
Listen, Eugene,
maybe you should leave.

21:00.190 --> 21:03.050
There's no sense
in exposing both of us.

21:03.050 --> 21:06.230
- I think I'd better stay.
- Why?

21:06.230 --> 21:09.030
- To make sure you're careful.

The alternative--she would live

22:15.090 --> 22:18.120
under a microscope,
as well as a stigma.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.090
- If it backfires,

22:20.090 --> 22:22.070
she could spend
that life in prison.

- What about all your friends?

Could somebody have
seen you take a shower?

22:36.130 --> 22:37.230
- Nobody knew.

- Well, that better be true.
Otherwise--

- It's not going to get out!

BOBBY: What if she has
a breakdown?

22:55.180 --> 22:57.070
What if you do?

22:59.130 --> 23:00.200
I'm just trying to get an idea

23:00.200 --> 23:05.010
of negligence versus
recklessness.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.180
How much clothing?

23:07.180 --> 23:09.230
- A few coats, some dresses.

23:09.230 --> 23:11.180
- How long was she buried for,
do you think?

23:11.180 --> 23:14.010
- Not that long.

23:14.010 --> 23:16.080
I uncovered her as soon
as I came back into the room.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.070
I went straight to the closet
and took them right off.

you came back into the room?

23:21.150 --> 23:23.090

BOBBY:
Well, how do you know that

23:38.200 --> 23:40.160
if you weren't in the room?
- I was only out a few minutes.

23:40.160 --> 23:44.230
I came back, and she was dead.

23:44.230 --> 23:47.150
- Did somebody else
go into that room?

23:55.140 --> 23:59.040
- Mary, did you go in there?

23:59.040 --> 24:00.080
Mary?

24:03.100 --> 24:06.170
Oh, my God.

24:06.170 --> 24:09.080
- The baby was dead
when I went in.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.090
- Why didn't you tell us
you went in?

24:14.080 --> 24:15.100
Why didn't you?

24:18.120 --> 24:22.170
- Teddy, can I talk
to you alone?

24:25.050 --> 24:27.000
- Okay.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.120
You can't even
tell me what it is?

24:28.120 --> 24:31.230
BOBBY: No.
- Bobby, I know somebody's dead.

24:31.230 --> 24:33.050
You might as well
just tell me what--

24:33.050 --> 24:36.180
BOBBY: No!
[dial tone humming]

24:36.180 --> 24:39.230
- He hung up on me.
- What did he say?

24:39.230 --> 24:41.140
- Just to reschedule
all his meetings.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.050
He could be out most of the day.

24:43.050 --> 24:44.150
The clients won't be happy.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.050
- Well, maybe
you could entertain them.

24:49.190 --> 24:52.030
- Are you jealous?

24:52.030 --> 24:54.150
- I'm sorry?
- Nothing.

24:54.150 --> 24:56.180
- What, you don't think
I can wear a dress like that?

24:56.180 --> 24:58.110
You think I'm too fat?
Is that it?

24:58.110 --> 25:00.090
- Did I say that?

25:00.090 --> 25:03.080
Look, the truth is, Ellenor,
I don't find you fat at all.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.210
I just think you're more
full of yourself than most.

25:06.210 --> 25:09.080
- What would remotely possess
you to say something like that

25:09.080 --> 25:10.190
to a partner?

25:10.190 --> 25:13.220
- My mother told me two things
before she died.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.210
One was, "Never let
somebody push you around

25:15.210 --> 25:18.040
just because they're
bigger or richer."

25:24.190 --> 25:27.170
- What's the other thing
she told you?

25:27.170 --> 25:29.050
- If you're ever
in an argument,

25:29.050 --> 25:31.160
you can always trump
with a dead mother.

25:34.220 --> 25:36.140
- I was too tired to swim.

25:36.140 --> 25:39.090
First, I kind of grabbed
on to Terry.

25:39.090 --> 25:41.000
You know, hold on?

25:41.000 --> 25:42.230
But the life jacket
wouldn't keep us both up,

25:42.230 --> 25:45.080
and he kept throwing me
off of him.

25:45.080 --> 25:47.110
I said, "Let's switch off
wearing the jacket,"

25:47.110 --> 25:48.220
but he just said no.

25:48.220 --> 25:50.040
- And then what happened?

25:50.040 --> 25:51.150
DAVID: Well, I was about
to drown.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.160
I was holding on
to this one piece of wood,

25:53.160 --> 25:55.080
which couldn't really
support me.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.070
I kept swimming to Terry.
He'd kick me away.

25:58.070 --> 26:00.180
I think we were both
scared of dying.

26:00.180 --> 26:01.210
- But at some point--

26:01.210 --> 26:04.140
- I told him I saw a boat,

26:04.140 --> 26:06.150
which I didn't.

26:06.150 --> 26:09.140
I pointed to distract him,
and when he looked away,

26:09.140 --> 26:12.000
I swung the piece
of wood I was holding,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.050
and it hit him
in the head.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.190
I hit him two more times,
till he was half out,

26:16.190 --> 26:18.120
then I peeled off
the life jacket,

26:18.120 --> 26:19.190
and I put it on.

26:19.190 --> 26:23.000
It was actually
about ten minutes later

26:23.000 --> 26:25.100
that I did spot the rescue boat.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.180
- Thank you.
That's all.

LINDSAY: Excuse me, Your Honor.

26:32.230 --> 26:34.150
I know this is extremely
unorthodox,

26:34.150 --> 26:36.170
but in the overall interest
of judicial economy,

26:36.170 --> 26:38.010
I would like
to be heard on duress.

26:38.010 --> 26:39.100
- What?

26:39.100 --> 26:40.230
- That's an affirmative defense,
Counsel.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.160
- I understand that,
but if a district attorney

26:42.160 --> 26:44.080
or a judge
knows a case won't make it--

26:44.080 --> 26:46.010
really should be dismissed--

26:46.010 --> 26:48.190
I would just like to be heard--
ten minutes, please.

26:48.190 --> 26:51.150
- Ten minutes.
- Some time to prepare?

26:51.150 --> 26:53.010
- One hour.

26:57.030 --> 27:00.180
- Then the defendant,
Clarence Barnett, approached me.

27:00.180 --> 27:02.090
- What were you doing
at the time?

27:02.090 --> 27:03.180
- My partner and I had just

27:03.180 --> 27:04.230
placed another person
under arrest

27:04.230 --> 27:07.030
when Mr. Barnett
walked up to us.

27:07.030 --> 27:08.180
MAN: And what happened
at that time?

27:08.180 --> 27:11.030
- Mr. Barnett handed me
two clear plastic packets

27:11.030 --> 27:12.130
of suspect cocaine

27:12.130 --> 27:15.060
and stated he wanted
to turn himself in.

27:15.060 --> 27:18.080
- He wanted to turn himself in?
- Yes.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.100
MAN: Were the packets
you recovered from the defendant

27:20.100 --> 27:22.130
sent to the crime lab
for testing and analysis?

27:22.130 --> 27:23.220
MAN: Yes, they were.

27:23.220 --> 27:25.120
- And to the best
of your knowledge,

27:25.120 --> 27:28.200
did they test positive
for .23 grams of cocaine?

27:28.200 --> 27:30.200
- Yes, they did.
MAN: Thank you.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.220
Nothing further.
Tender the witness.

27:32.220 --> 27:34.010
- Ms. Washington?

27:36.030 --> 27:38.220
- Just walked right up,
out of the blue.

27:38.220 --> 27:40.040
- That's what I'm saying.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.090
- And prior
to him approaching you,

27:41.090 --> 27:43.100
as you allege,

27:43.100 --> 27:47.040
you hadn't observed him engage
in any illegal conduct?

27:47.040 --> 27:48.160
- No.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.220
REBECCA: Didn't observe him
with any drugs?

27:49.220 --> 27:51.000
- No, I didn't.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.160
- He just walked
right up to you.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.030
- Yes, he walked over
and handed me two packets

27:55.030 --> 27:57.040
of what appeared to be cocaine.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.060
- And said?

27:58.060 --> 28:00.130
- "Officer, I have drugs,

28:00.130 --> 28:04.080
and I want to turn myself in."

28:04.080 --> 28:05.210
- Didn't tell you he killed JFK?

28:05.210 --> 28:08.040
- Objection.
- Sustained.

28:08.040 --> 28:11.000
- Walked right up.
- On his own accord.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.180
JUDGE: Let me make sure
I understand what you're saying,

28:12.180 --> 28:15.020
even though you've said it
three or four times.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.200
Mr. Barnett just walked
up to you as a Good Samaritan

28:17.200 --> 28:21.030
and turned himself in without
any prior contact on your part?

28:21.030 --> 28:23.040
- Yes.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.180
- Mr. Barnett,
you're free to go.

28:25.180 --> 28:27.190
MAN: Your Honor.
- Counsel.

28:32.140 --> 28:34.120
Mr. Torkelso,
I'd advise you

28:34.120 --> 28:36.090
to counsel your officers
that in the future,

28:36.090 --> 28:38.220
if they're gonna try to make
the facts conform to the law,

28:38.220 --> 28:41.130
they should at least try
to make it sound believable.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.030
- But that's just the point.

28:43.030 --> 28:45.070
If he wanted to lie,
he could easily have come up

28:45.070 --> 28:47.040
with something
that sounded more plausible.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.100
It's so outlandish,
it has to be true.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.190
- Or maybe he thought of that.

28:50.190 --> 28:53.230
Be glad I don't find misconduct.

28:53.230 --> 28:56.100
Just walked right up.

29:05.130 --> 29:08.220
- I--I'm afraid
this is much worse

29:08.220 --> 29:11.040
than I thought.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.190
- Mary killed the baby.

29:15.210 --> 29:19.230
- She--she thought
I was the father.

29:19.230 --> 29:21.190
- What?

29:21.190 --> 29:24.110
- She--when Julie wouldn't
tell her who the father was,

29:24.110 --> 29:26.170
she suddenly thought it was me.

29:26.170 --> 29:29.050
Don't ask me to explain how.

29:29.050 --> 29:31.210
- Have you?

29:31.210 --> 29:36.030
- God, Bobby, no, never.

29:36.030 --> 29:38.140
Of course not.
- How could your wife think

29:38.140 --> 29:40.020
that you were the father,
if you didn't--

29:40.020 --> 29:41.220
- Oh, God, I don't--
I don't know.

29:41.220 --> 29:44.010
She's been battling
some depression,

29:44.010 --> 29:48.040
but to think--so I don't know.

29:50.190 --> 29:52.220
I think she's having
some kind of breakdown.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.010
What do I do now?

30:11.100 --> 30:13.010
BOBBY: Tell me the name
of the father.

30:13.010 --> 30:14.150
- Why is that important?

30:14.150 --> 30:15.200
- Because I want to know.

30:15.200 --> 30:19.030
- His name is Steven Gilbert,

30:19.030 --> 30:20.070
but he doesn't know.

30:20.070 --> 30:22.030
EUGENE: Okay, look, personally,

30:22.030 --> 30:23.150
I don't know any of you
well enough to know

30:23.150 --> 30:25.050
whether you're telling
the truth or not.

30:25.050 --> 30:27.150
But here's what we got:
a dead baby;

30:27.150 --> 30:29.100
a person here
who killed that baby;

30:29.100 --> 30:31.150
a person here who maybe
left the room, maybe not;

30:31.150 --> 30:33.190
a person here who maybe
is the father, maybe not.

30:33.190 --> 30:35.020
- I am not the father.

30:35.020 --> 30:36.120
