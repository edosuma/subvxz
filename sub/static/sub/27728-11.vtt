WEBVTT

00:00.046 --> 00:02.108
Previously on Roswell, New Mexico...

00:02.133 --> 00:03.789
All this time, I never remembered her,

00:04.014 --> 00:05.718
but I remember now.

00:05.743 --> 00:08.710
I was friends with Rosa Ortecho.

00:08.735 --> 00:10.070
I want to be with you.

00:10.095 --> 00:11.563
That's why I told you the truth today.

00:11.588 --> 00:13.148
Alex is one of my best friends.

00:13.173 --> 00:14.125
I never would've slept with you

00:14.150 --> 00:15.476
if I knew you two had history.

00:15.501 --> 00:17.046
It can't happen again.

00:17.742 --> 00:19.344
There have been a few
unexplained deaths.

00:19.369 --> 00:22.078
One link between all the victims
is that they had that stamp

00:22.103 --> 00:23.679
on their wrists when they died.

00:23.704 --> 00:25.359
If what you're suggesting is true,

00:25.599 --> 00:27.868
we aren't investigating a serial killer,

00:27.893 --> 00:29.494
we are investigating

00:29.519 --> 00:31.781
an alien serial killer.

00:31.806 --> 00:33.351
I think this was a targeted attack.

00:33.376 --> 00:35.320
What if this was about the other work

00:35.345 --> 00:36.446
that I've been doing in here?

00:36.471 --> 00:37.531
The antidote and the serum,

00:37.556 --> 00:38.724
they're all gone.

00:38.849 --> 00:41.210
I just told you, I don't remember.

00:41.235 --> 00:42.931
I really blacked it all out.

00:42.956 --> 00:44.257
I think there's a fourth alien,

00:44.282 --> 00:45.349
and I think maybe your sister

00:45.374 --> 00:47.109
is innocent of all of this.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.179
What if the fourth alien can...

00:49.204 --> 00:50.945
Get in people's minds
when they're blacked out

00:50.970 --> 00:52.771
and convince them to commit murder.

00:52.903 --> 00:54.093
Then I think they're far more dangerous

00:54.118 --> 00:55.921
than anything we've seen before.

00:57.171 --> 00:59.467
_

00:59.492 --> 01:00.797
When faced with a true threat

01:00.822 --> 01:04.566
to your survival, trust can
be your greatest comfort...

01:06.645 --> 01:08.652
and your greatest weakness.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.950
Do you trust your family?

01:15.289 --> 01:17.955
Do you trust your best friend?

01:21.494 --> 01:24.210
What about your own mind?

01:24.798 --> 01:26.880
Do you trust your own heart?

01:29.828 --> 01:31.843
Do you really trust the person

01:31.868 --> 01:34.304
you love most in the world?

01:35.426 --> 01:37.374
You shouldn't.

01:47.073 --> 01:49.191
The memory wasn't mine. I'm telling you.

01:49.216 --> 01:51.152
It's like someone else
was inside of my body.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.745
It was like they were using it.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.699
I can influence someone,

01:54.724 --> 01:55.808
you know, but this fourth alien,

01:55.833 --> 01:57.077
they were much stronger than that.

01:57.102 --> 01:58.058
They were controlling me.

01:58.083 --> 01:59.230
It was like I wasn't even present.

01:59.255 --> 02:00.914
So we're back to square one.

02:00.939 --> 02:02.207
Anyone could've killed my sister.

02:02.232 --> 02:04.847
Well, someone's guilty. Rosa
was just the beginning.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.050
Except for Rosa, all of
the victims were targeted

02:07.075 --> 02:08.901
after Ranchero Night at the Wild Pony.

02:08.926 --> 02:10.783
Maria's meal for the disenfranchised.

02:10.863 --> 02:12.297
The next Ranchero Night is next week,

02:12.322 --> 02:13.504
which doesn't give us much time

02:13.529 --> 02:14.687
before someone else could end up dead.

02:14.712 --> 02:16.381
All right, I'm gonna head to work.

02:16.406 --> 02:18.306
Cam and I will build a profile.

02:18.331 --> 02:19.646
And I'm gonna head to the hospital.

02:19.671 --> 02:20.819
The killer took most of the serum

02:20.844 --> 02:22.379
when they wrecked my lab.

02:22.636 --> 02:24.499
We need to make more. We
only have one dose left.

02:24.524 --> 02:26.254
How does the killer
know about the serum?

02:26.309 --> 02:27.911
Killer seems to know about everything.

02:28.287 --> 02:30.174
They could've possessed
anyone at any time,

02:30.199 --> 02:31.628
they could've overheard us.

02:31.653 --> 02:34.222
They've gotten away with 14 murders.

02:34.908 --> 02:37.158
They need to believe they're
still in the clear.

02:37.183 --> 02:39.401
So just pretend aliens don't exist

02:39.426 --> 02:40.456
and we live in a boring, quiet town

02:40.481 --> 02:42.036
- where nothing ever happens.
- Yes.

02:42.061 --> 02:44.431
Max and I will go to
work, Isobel will host

02:44.456 --> 02:46.630
the UFO Emporium grand
reopening gala tonight,

02:46.655 --> 02:47.706
as planned, and Michael

02:47.731 --> 02:50.040
will spend his time however
Michael spends his time.

02:50.065 --> 02:51.548
Okay?

02:54.855 --> 02:57.558
Hey, so...

02:57.583 --> 02:59.388
this gala tonight,

03:00.328 --> 03:01.725
would you be my date?

03:01.959 --> 03:03.316
Unfortunately, I've already accepted

03:03.341 --> 03:05.269
another man's request for my company.

03:06.427 --> 03:07.988
Right. Your dad.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.691
Yeah. I promised him
we would go together.

03:11.394 --> 03:13.262
But I'll see you there.

03:13.287 --> 03:16.433
- Right?
- Yeah. I can't wait.

03:19.183 --> 03:21.453
Your ballroom dancing skills
improve since high school?

03:22.153 --> 03:23.830
Oh, they have definitely

03:23.855 --> 03:25.677
gotten much worse.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.410
Ranchero Night isn't an accident.
I mean, the killer

03:33.435 --> 03:35.549
targets undocumented immigrants,

03:35.574 --> 03:37.230
homeless people, young drug addicts,

03:37.255 --> 03:38.661
our most vulnerable citizens.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.431
And he expects us to not look
into those deaths too closely.

03:41.528 --> 03:43.867
So the killer is able to
incept or possess people

03:43.892 --> 03:45.761
who have conditions that
cause blackouts, right?

03:45.786 --> 03:48.449
Alcoholics, epileptics,
people like Isobel

03:48.474 --> 03:50.081
who have blackouts triggered by trauma.

03:50.252 --> 03:51.607
Cameron, Evans.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.527
I'm supposed to let you know

03:52.552 --> 03:54.652
they're bringing Wyatt Long in.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.217
Uh, he's on house arrest awaiting trial.

03:57.296 --> 03:58.280
His lawyer says

03:58.305 --> 04:00.117
he has information you may want.

04:02.253 --> 04:05.288
That lowlife wants to make a deal?

04:06.303 --> 04:08.833
Let me play bad cop this time, Evans.

04:08.858 --> 04:10.876
It looks better on me.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.119 --> 04:28.937
Isobel!

04:31.004 --> 04:33.900
Whoa. Easy, killer.

04:36.004 --> 04:39.581
I realize now that was a
poor choice of words.

04:39.781 --> 04:41.533
I'm fine.

04:41.952 --> 04:43.168
You're jumpy.

04:43.427 --> 04:46.620
Whoever did this used powers
that I didn't know I had

04:46.657 --> 04:48.726
to kill a girl I didn't
even know I knew.

04:48.751 --> 04:51.987
You said you two were friends.

04:53.963 --> 04:57.160
Maybe more. I...

04:57.185 --> 04:58.675
I don't know.

05:02.784 --> 05:03.888
Wasn't she troubled?

05:03.913 --> 05:05.683
That's a word for it.

05:06.692 --> 05:09.894
I've spent years pretending
that I'm not what I am,

05:09.919 --> 05:11.938
so I never honed my skills.

05:12.919 --> 05:15.142
Maybe if I... if I practiced,

05:15.167 --> 05:17.536
I could get stronger, you know,
I could have more control.

05:17.561 --> 05:21.332
I-I don't think more crazy
alien stuff is the answer.

05:21.918 --> 05:25.035
I don't like feeling like a victim.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.078
You have me now.

05:29.552 --> 05:31.128
We're stronger together.

05:31.413 --> 05:32.815
Let's make a pact.

05:33.209 --> 05:34.752
No more powers.

05:35.062 --> 05:36.199
When you use them,

05:36.224 --> 05:39.590
you get sick, you black out.
You become an easy mark.

05:41.838 --> 05:43.719
Promise me.

05:51.144 --> 05:53.896
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

05:57.287 --> 06:00.111
Were you about to pretend
you didn't see me?

06:01.318 --> 06:02.528
No.

06:02.947 --> 06:05.908
I just didn't recognize you in daylight.

06:06.776 --> 06:08.855
What, are you planning
on feeding an army?

06:08.880 --> 06:10.457
I'm gonna pull an all-nighter.

06:11.298 --> 06:13.019
You're not going to the gala, then?

06:13.044 --> 06:17.059
No. No, I couldn't decide
which of my tuxedos to wear,

06:17.084 --> 06:18.422
so I'm gonna skip it.

06:18.447 --> 06:19.801
Alex is skipping it, too.

06:19.826 --> 06:23.258
I guess he spent enough time
there during high school.

06:23.735 --> 06:25.428
Look, it's over.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.138
It's been over.

06:29.692 --> 06:31.238
You didn't do anything wrong.

06:31.590 --> 06:32.739
No offense, Guerin,

06:32.764 --> 06:36.731
but you are not exactly the
arbiter of friendship.

06:40.584 --> 06:42.434
Is the cage really necessary?

06:42.738 --> 06:44.739
Well, if it smells like a stray dog...

06:44.764 --> 06:46.283
Easy, Cameron.

06:46.537 --> 06:49.202
On second thought, maybe
it's safer in here.

06:49.227 --> 06:53.801
I know. Last time I saw
you, we got a little upset.

06:56.635 --> 06:58.878
But I don't believe you
killed Grant Green.

06:59.135 --> 07:00.637
I think you were set up.

07:00.662 --> 07:02.457
Now, I could testify as much,

07:02.482 --> 07:05.176
if the information you say
you have is worth it.

07:09.337 --> 07:12.113
My buddy Hank says y'all
were investigating a murder.

07:13.018 --> 07:15.371
Carla, the hot Mexican
from Ranchero Night.

07:15.396 --> 07:17.020
What do you know about Carla?

07:18.230 --> 07:20.272
I saw her on Cinco de Mayo

07:20.297 --> 07:21.865
at the Wild Pony.

07:22.245 --> 07:24.620
I was leaving, and I heard yelling

07:24.645 --> 07:27.902
from the delivery door.
Carla was back there,

07:27.927 --> 07:29.246
screaming her head off,

07:29.271 --> 07:31.974
in some kind of a fight
with Maria DeLuca.

07:40.434 --> 07:43.089
Damn.

08:09.115 --> 08:10.771
Maybe the killer's
possessing Wyatt right now,

08:10.796 --> 08:13.468
trying to throw us off. It's not Maria.

08:14.036 --> 08:17.247
She's Liz's best friend. Liz would know.

08:17.721 --> 08:20.827
Yeah, and we spent 12 hours a day

08:20.852 --> 08:22.317
in a car together for two years,

08:22.342 --> 08:24.377
and I never once thought,
"Hmm, he kind of smells

08:24.402 --> 08:26.569
like an intergalactic
crime fighter today."

08:26.790 --> 08:29.999
Fair. All right. I'll keep
an eye on her at the gala,

08:30.024 --> 08:32.222
see if Liz noticed anything strange.

08:33.041 --> 08:36.268
Hey, before you guys go
on your donut break,

08:36.582 --> 08:39.342
- I want to finalize my deal.
- Deal?

08:39.602 --> 08:42.106
I don't remember anything about a deal.

08:42.495 --> 08:44.835
- Do you, Evans?
- No.

08:44.860 --> 08:46.819
I don't quite recollect that at all.

08:48.879 --> 08:50.124
You lied to me.

08:50.149 --> 08:52.257
You told me that you
believed that I was set up,

08:52.282 --> 08:53.925
that you'd testify as much!

08:53.950 --> 08:55.742
I don't believe you were responsible

08:55.767 --> 08:57.335
for Grant Green's death.

08:57.556 --> 09:00.232
I think you were a puppet for
someone much stronger than you.

09:00.257 --> 09:02.444
But you are a racist sack of stupid

09:02.469 --> 09:05.438
with years of your daddy bailing
you out of violent crimes.

09:05.762 --> 09:09.413
Back in June, when you shot
out the Crashdown windows,

09:09.438 --> 09:11.117
you got away with murder.

09:11.142 --> 09:12.761
So I'm gonna let you rot.

09:13.534 --> 09:15.222
Society gets the W,

09:15.527 --> 09:18.142
and I'm gonna sleep easy tonight.

09:41.544 --> 09:43.084
Que guapo.

09:44.510 --> 09:47.616
It's strange without Rosa's things,

09:47.839 --> 09:49.299
but it was time.

09:49.913 --> 09:53.051
It doesn't feel like it's
mine without being hers.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.296
- Does that make any sense?
- Of course.

09:56.510 --> 09:58.381
What else is bothering you?

09:59.143 --> 10:00.185
Well,

10:00.210 --> 10:03.568
I went to the hospital today
to try to talk to Dr. Avila

10:03.593 --> 10:05.468
about a plan to salvage our study.

10:05.723 --> 10:08.143
Turns out there is no plan.

10:08.168 --> 10:09.936
Our funding was pulled
because they think

10:09.961 --> 10:12.238
the attack on the
hospital was political.

10:12.802 --> 10:15.325
Avila's relocating the
study to Palo Alto,

10:15.540 --> 10:17.319
where things are more progressive.

10:17.344 --> 10:20.163
And she wants you to go with her.

10:20.188 --> 10:21.705
I am not leaving you.

10:22.446 --> 10:26.202
Mira, I have loved

10:26.227 --> 10:28.225
having you here these last months,

10:28.250 --> 10:32.007
and you know that. But
this diner, it's...

10:32.480 --> 10:33.939
it's my American dream.

10:33.964 --> 10:35.679
Yours is so much bigger.

10:37.913 --> 10:40.259
Unless it's not me holding you back?

10:40.284 --> 10:42.453
Papi, have we met?

10:42.992 --> 10:44.729
Nothing's gonna hold me back.

10:45.874 --> 10:47.669
I've been meaning to ask you...

10:48.423 --> 10:50.317
I know it's risky,

10:50.342 --> 10:53.571
but I think we should
explore citizenship again.

10:56.637 --> 10:59.280
How about we discuss it
over a dance tonight?

10:59.305 --> 11:01.041
Mm-hmm.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.682
Hurry up.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.652
I like to make an entrance.

11:07.677 --> 11:09.980
Okay, ahora ve.

11:42.441 --> 11:44.138
This town cleans up well.

11:44.601 --> 11:47.240
Como un lobo con piel de oveja.

11:47.266 --> 11:50.795
Ooh. Okay, well,

11:50.820 --> 11:52.864
I'm going to get us some drinks.

11:56.654 --> 11:58.589
Ooh! Excuse me.

11:58.614 --> 12:00.433
Hi!

12:00.458 --> 12:02.393
God, look who's embracing the party.

12:02.418 --> 12:04.518
I love the dress.

12:05.055 --> 12:06.423
But you're wearing red lipstick.

12:06.708 --> 12:07.849
- And?
- What, you think

12:07.874 --> 12:09.980
I don't know Rosa's rules? Red is armor.

12:10.178 --> 12:12.559
Plus, nobody wears that shade
if they're hoping to hook up

12:12.584 --> 12:15.341
with a hot cop by the end of the night.
It's messy.

12:15.366 --> 12:18.448
I am not armoring myself
against Max Evans.

12:18.848 --> 12:21.324
I mean, not on purpose, anyway.
I'm crazy about him.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.869
And yet...

12:24.304 --> 12:25.826
There's this opportunity in Palo Alto...

12:25.851 --> 12:28.590
No. You can do your
research from anywhere.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.383
Don't use this as an
excuse to run from Max.

12:30.408 --> 12:31.676
I like him for you.

12:31.736 --> 12:32.927
You fit right under his chin,

12:32.952 --> 12:35.630
like a perfect little
zupple piece... pu...

12:35.655 --> 12:37.174
puzzle piece.

12:37.488 --> 12:39.052
- Whoa. Puzzle piece.
- Puzzle piece.

12:51.424 --> 12:54.066
- What the hell is this place?
- Underground,

12:54.531 --> 12:56.152
beneath my trailer.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.696
It used to be a fallout
shelter, now I, uh,

13:00.088 --> 13:02.157
I use it for projects.

13:04.058 --> 13:05.559
We got to get out of here.

13:06.122 --> 13:07.954
How the hell did I get in here?

13:08.139 --> 13:09.499
I don't know.

13:10.349 --> 13:12.020
I was working and some
smoke bomb went off

13:12.045 --> 13:13.076
in my jacket pocket.

13:13.101 --> 13:15.213
Got this yellow powder
all over the place,

13:15.238 --> 13:17.434
- and I passed out.
- There's no service down here.

13:17.662 --> 13:19.967
When I woke up, you were here, too.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.994
And we are locked in.

13:22.728 --> 13:24.888
Well, you have a lock
pick in your brain.

13:26.470 --> 13:28.058
Yeah, that's the thing.

13:28.434 --> 13:30.903
I think this residue is
rendering us powerless somehow.

13:31.194 --> 13:32.662
Guessing your errant erections

13:32.687 --> 13:34.606
aren't gonna make the
lights flicker either.

13:34.986 --> 13:37.451
We're completely trapped, and...

13:37.763 --> 13:40.404
and there's nothing we can do about it.

13:48.652 --> 13:50.038
Good evening.

13:50.269 --> 13:52.425
On behalf of Roswell's tourism board

13:52.450 --> 13:53.750
and the Grant Green estate,

13:53.775 --> 13:55.837
thank you all so much for joining us.

13:55.862 --> 13:58.786
Now please give a warm round of applause

13:58.889 --> 14:01.802
to Grant's brother, Graham Green.

14:06.488 --> 14:09.058
Thank you, fellow humans.

14:09.267 --> 14:11.035
Now, the money raised tonight

14:11.060 --> 14:14.653
will benefit a cause dear
to my late brother's heart,

14:14.749 --> 14:19.693
Roswell's quest to expose the
truth about extraterrestrials.

14:19.866 --> 14:23.406
Now, Grant's work will
continue, forever immortalized

14:23.431 --> 14:27.034
in the brand-new UFO Emporium.

14:27.381 --> 14:29.703
Have fun tonight, and remember,

14:30.180 --> 14:31.873
they're watching.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.849
You know, h-he looks
exactly like his brother.

14:38.874 --> 14:41.299
Mm-hmm. Yeah, speaking of brothers,

14:41.324 --> 14:42.525
where the hell is mine?

14:42.550 --> 14:44.011
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

14:44.036 --> 14:46.220
Just try to relax and enjoy yourself.

14:46.245 --> 14:48.115
Max is late, the caterers
messed up the crudités,

14:48.140 --> 14:49.833
oh, yeah, and there's a
killer on the loose who used

14:49.858 --> 14:52.239
- my body as a weapon.
- I'll call Max

14:52.264 --> 14:53.934
and check on the hors d'oeuvres and then

14:53.959 --> 14:56.442
I'll try and distract you
from the whole murder thing

14:56.467 --> 14:58.700
with a potential quickie in
the crop circle exhibit.

14:58.725 --> 15:00.231
Oh.

15:06.265 --> 15:07.834
Sorry. I, uh,

15:07.859 --> 15:10.052
had to dodge Graham Green. The
resemblance is, like, ugh.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.455
Yeah, no, it's-it's fine.

15:13.815 --> 15:15.395
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I was just,

15:15.419 --> 15:18.990
um, expecting a call from my
sister, and it never came.

15:19.692 --> 15:23.247
Well, Kyle told me you've
made some personal sacrifices

15:23.272 --> 15:24.674
to protect Max.

15:24.699 --> 15:27.552
Thank you. I'd like to help if I can.

15:29.594 --> 15:31.396
Okay, um,

15:31.421 --> 15:34.476
Jesse Manes wants access to
the sheriff's department.

15:34.933 --> 15:38.177
He wants information about
anything strange going on,

15:38.202 --> 15:40.106
and the longer it takes me to
give him that information,

15:40.131 --> 15:42.901
the longer he has my
sister under his thumb.

15:43.180 --> 15:45.655
She's in a military
correctional facility.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.636
At least, she was.

15:47.661 --> 15:50.052
So you're protecting
Max over your sister?

15:50.255 --> 15:52.328
I'm trying to do what's right.

15:55.021 --> 15:56.648
Why aren't you with him?

15:56.673 --> 15:58.042
Uh, he left before I did.

15:58.067 --> 16:00.961
- He's not here yet.
- No, he's not.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.028
And if he doesn't pick
up his phone soon,

16:03.053 --> 16:04.588
I'm gonna murder him.

16:04.778 --> 16:08.301
- Too soon?
- Uh... so, he hasn't told you.

16:09.439 --> 16:11.177
Max and I got new info

16:11.202 --> 16:13.974
about who the fourth alien might be.

16:16.854 --> 16:18.599
Damn it.

16:18.624 --> 16:19.980
Yeah, no kidding.

16:20.005 --> 16:22.013
Almost like I tried that already,

16:22.038 --> 16:24.092
but by all means.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.638
What's your problem, Michael?

16:25.663 --> 16:27.665
I want to get out of here
just as bad as you do.

16:27.690 --> 16:30.815
I just got rendered powerless
by some kind of pollen,

16:30.840 --> 16:32.542
and I have no idea what the hell it is.

16:32.567 --> 16:34.869
And that is my fault?

16:36.534 --> 16:38.750
You're the one who never
wanted us to ask questions.

16:39.130 --> 16:42.043
Never wanted us to call
attention to ourselves.

16:42.730 --> 16:45.406
You made the rule, and then
we followed it blindly,

16:45.431 --> 16:47.302
and now there's someone out
there who's stronger than us,

16:47.327 --> 16:48.592
who knows more about us than we do.

16:48.617 --> 16:50.020
Yeah, well, judging from this place,

16:50.045 --> 16:53.055
you've clearly been
avoiding alien information.

16:53.559 --> 16:55.567
No one made you follow my rule, Michael.

16:55.592 --> 16:57.027
I'm not your dad.

17:00.634 --> 17:02.825
You sure as hell been acting
like it all our lives.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.492
Yeah, it's been a real treat.

17:05.377 --> 17:06.944
Look, we got to get out of here.

17:07.752 --> 17:10.363
Isobel and Liz are at the gala with...

17:11.510 --> 17:12.877
With who?

17:13.307 --> 17:15.357
Cameron and I targeted
a person of interest

17:15.382 --> 17:16.954
in our investigation.

17:18.035 --> 17:19.887
Who's the damn suspect, Max?

17:19.999 --> 17:22.035
We're eyeing Maria DeLuca.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.255
What? No. Absolutely not.

17:24.280 --> 17:26.051
She was in an altercation

17:26.077 --> 17:28.713
with one of the murderer's
victims the night she died.

17:28.738 --> 17:31.474
It's circumstantial, but
we have to look into it.

17:31.623 --> 17:32.693
Wait a second, that,

17:32.718 --> 17:34.779
that actually makes sense.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.441
Because when I tried to influence her,

17:36.466 --> 17:38.100
I got violently ill,

17:38.125 --> 17:40.615
and then I woke up in the desert
with no clue how I got there.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.488
All the victims are frequent to her bar,

17:42.513 --> 17:43.958
she's the one who pointed us towards

17:43.983 --> 17:45.849
Hank Gibbons, which didn't pan out.

17:45.874 --> 17:48.343
Maria hates me, and she
loved your sister.

17:48.543 --> 17:51.279
I mean, whoever murdered Rosa
wanted her all to themselves.

17:51.525 --> 17:53.537
- I could feel that.
- Maria is

17:53.562 --> 17:54.943
my best friend. Yeah.

17:54.968 --> 17:57.620
Who knows about obscure zodiac lore,

17:57.866 --> 18:00.002
and who's still obsessed with
your sister's favorite music,

18:00.027 --> 18:02.333
and knew all of her secret hiding spots.

18:02.645 --> 18:05.002
Give us a reason it can't be true, Liz.

18:11.666 --> 18:13.861
I mean, it's not like
murderers walk around

18:13.886 --> 18:15.236
with a sign hanging around
their necks saying,

18:15.261 --> 18:17.448
- "Hey, I'm a murderer."
- Isobel's right.

18:17.473 --> 18:19.808
Chances are, the killer
is someone you know.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.668
I mean, it all adds up.

18:21.837 --> 18:24.112
Maria had motive, she had opportunity.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.340
And she had some kind of
weird alien force field

18:26.365 --> 18:27.308
around her brain.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.192
It is not Maria.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.972
It's not Maria!

18:35.278 --> 18:37.877
- I'm serious, look elsewhere.
- Since when have you been

18:37.902 --> 18:39.612
- her biggest fan?
- I'm not.

18:39.637 --> 18:41.464
- But I know her.
- How well?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.667
Close enough to slip something
in your jacket pocket?

18:51.284 --> 18:53.049
Are you into her?

18:53.722 --> 18:55.457
'Cause, here,

18:55.482 --> 18:56.762
I thought you were gay.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.956
Oh, we are literally aliens,

18:59.507 --> 19:02.530
and you're gonna hold me to some
outdated binary of sexuality?

19:02.555 --> 19:04.519
I'm bisexual, Max.

19:05.004 --> 19:06.564
It's not that complicated.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.340
Okay.

19:08.365 --> 19:10.495
Maybe if you'd talk to me,
I would've known that.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.555
- We talk.
- We speak.

19:13.226 --> 19:15.081
We haven't talked in
years, and you know it.

19:15.106 --> 19:17.375
You want to talk about how
we covered up a murder?

19:17.539 --> 19:19.714
Hey, you're the one who decided
to take the blame for killing

19:19.739 --> 19:21.636
those girls, to let
Isobel think it was you.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.635
I didn't do that to you.

19:22.660 --> 19:24.331
You decided to cover it up.

19:25.068 --> 19:26.749
We should have told the truth.

19:27.518 --> 19:29.920
I didn't have parents to turn to.

19:30.371 --> 19:31.714
You did.

19:32.552 --> 19:35.884
But you didn't want to tell 'em,
so we carried it ourselves.

19:38.529 --> 19:40.135
We never should've done that.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.564
I get it. You haven't been
mad at me for ten years,

19:42.589 --> 19:43.837
you've been angry for 20.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.586
Ever since my parents
showed up and picked me.

19:48.048 --> 19:50.440
I got the family, I got the sister.

19:52.041 --> 19:54.298
- You want to talk about burdens?
- Mm.

19:54.323 --> 19:57.854
I carry the guilt of
that day everywhere.

19:58.699 --> 20:00.167
I pushed my own parents away

20:00.192 --> 20:02.479
because I am pissed they
didn't take care of you.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.955
You are my family, Michael.

20:06.966 --> 20:09.397
Everything that happens
to you happens to me.

20:09.422 --> 20:12.128
Every beating, every burn,
every damn heartbreak,

20:12.153 --> 20:14.172
you are never alone.

20:17.802 --> 20:20.345
We are trapped together
in all sorts of ways.

20:24.729 --> 20:26.977
Hey, I was looking for you.

20:27.652 --> 20:29.948
Can we bail on this thing?

20:29.973 --> 20:31.456
- Oh?
- I need some girl time.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.940
It's the blonde leading
the blonde out there.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.378
I'm having fun.

20:34.575 --> 20:37.446
Isobel went all out
planning this thing, hmm?

20:39.136 --> 20:40.671
Do you mind watching my purse?

20:40.696 --> 20:42.456
Major undergarment adjustment to make.

20:42.481 --> 20:43.993
Mm-hmm.

20:44.177 --> 20:47.538
- Can I borrow some lip gloss?
- Since when do you ask?

20:48.533 --> 20:50.251
We could go to the rooftop

20:50.276 --> 20:51.835
or back to the Wild Pony.

20:51.925 --> 20:54.839
I mean, we're not really
gala types, are we?

20:55.866 --> 20:57.906
Speak for yourself.

21:25.531 --> 21:26.915
Maria stole the serum.

21:26.940 --> 21:28.233
- What?
- Relax.

21:28.258 --> 21:30.226
I used a fake syringe as bait.
I still have the real one.

21:30.251 --> 21:32.655
Great. Give it to me. I'm going to enjoy

21:32.680 --> 21:34.016
taking Maria DeLuca down for good.

21:34.041 --> 21:35.656
Okay, here on Earth,

21:35.681 --> 21:37.899
we have a little bit of
a process before giving

21:37.924 --> 21:39.961
- the death sentence.
- Maria's not the killer.

21:40.118 --> 21:43.242
I think she's being possessed by
the killer, just like you were.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.430
Isobel, she said something

21:44.455 --> 21:46.391
nice about you in there.
She's not herself.

21:46.416 --> 21:47.450
Hmm.

21:47.923 --> 21:49.266
Well, the hospital shooter, Wyatt Long,

21:49.291 --> 21:50.726
and I all had blackouts
before the killer

21:50.751 --> 21:51.938
had access to our minds.

21:51.963 --> 21:55.065
So does Maria have some kind of
preexisting blackout condition?

21:55.758 --> 21:57.672
I mean, this would explain
her fashion choices.

21:57.697 --> 21:58.688
No.

21:58.713 --> 22:00.281
She could've been dosed.

22:00.578 --> 22:01.938
I'm gonna go home real quick,

22:01.971 --> 22:03.344
check on the champagne
under a microscope.

22:03.369 --> 22:04.637
Wait, no.

22:05.067 --> 22:08.119
This nail polish has a date
rape drug detector shine.

22:08.555 --> 22:10.956
- That's not a thing.
- It is, actually.

22:10.981 --> 22:13.774
- Welcome to modern dating.
- God, hard pass.

22:13.799 --> 22:14.813
Okay.

22:14.838 --> 22:17.007
Good news, Maria is not the killer.

22:17.032 --> 22:18.965
Bad news, she was drugged.

22:19.514 --> 22:20.844
You and I need to find Maria

22:20.869 --> 22:24.136
before the fourth alien uses her
to do something we can't undo.

22:37.228 --> 22:38.400
What's wrong?

22:38.425 --> 22:40.193
My hand just stiffens,

22:40.404 --> 22:42.238
seizes up sometimes.

22:46.131 --> 22:48.400
So what's the real story?

22:49.971 --> 22:51.205
I've told you.

22:51.230 --> 22:53.733
No. You've said bar fight,

22:53.942 --> 22:55.816
you've said junkyard accident,

22:55.841 --> 22:58.087
you've said chupacabra.

22:59.270 --> 23:01.090
You've never told me the truth.

23:05.058 --> 23:06.762
Alex Manes's father.

23:09.250 --> 23:10.765
He caught us together.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.727
And he just snapped.

23:15.861 --> 23:18.397
- You never let me heal it.
- Yeah.

23:18.693 --> 23:21.153
How would I explain a
perfectly good hand to Alex?

23:22.353 --> 23:24.438
Anything to protect the secret.

23:24.582 --> 23:26.406
Talk to me, dude.

23:27.308 --> 23:29.284
Nothing else for us to do.

23:36.771 --> 23:39.211
I didn't let you heal it
because I needed the reminder.

23:41.758 --> 23:43.147
I needed evidence

23:43.172 --> 23:45.967
of what could happen

23:45.992 --> 23:49.221
when you believe that
humanity might be good.

23:50.733 --> 23:51.883
Alex made me believe

23:51.908 --> 23:53.843
there was a place for me here.

23:55.798 --> 23:58.313
Hope's a dangerous thing.

23:59.087 --> 24:01.280
These scars, they remind me

24:01.305 --> 24:03.444
to avoid it in the future.

24:10.736 --> 24:12.703
Found her.

24:15.533 --> 24:17.206
- She's still breathing.
- Good.

24:17.231 --> 24:18.843
And her pulse is steady.

24:19.164 --> 24:20.331
According to the Internet,

24:20.356 --> 24:22.421
she just needs to, to sleep it off.

24:23.240 --> 24:24.908
The syringe is gone.

24:24.933 --> 24:26.695
She must have handed it
off to the real killer.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.445
Oh, my God.

24:27.470 --> 24:29.562
Which means whoever it
is, they're onto us.

24:29.587 --> 24:30.922
Really need Max here.

24:30.947 --> 24:32.515
Think he stood me up.

24:32.540 --> 24:33.741
Please.

24:33.907 --> 24:36.184
That's something that
you would do, not him.

24:37.181 --> 24:38.854
You're the one who got into my mind

24:38.879 --> 24:40.646
and made me leave town
ten years ago, Isobel.

24:40.671 --> 24:41.565
I never would have...

24:41.590 --> 24:42.857
No, you would have.

24:43.102 --> 24:45.530
That's the thing... I can't
make people do something

24:45.555 --> 24:47.257
that they don't already want to do.

24:47.440 --> 24:50.022
- You wanted to run away.
- Yeah, my sister was dead.

24:50.132 --> 24:51.218
The whole town had turned against us...

24:51.243 --> 24:52.671
Yeah, but that's not what
I sent you away from.

24:52.696 --> 24:55.244
I sent you away from Max,
and you left because,

24:55.795 --> 24:57.664
deep down, you wanted to go.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.417
Look, that's not something
that he ever needs to know.

25:00.442 --> 25:02.127
But you should.

25:04.273 --> 25:06.836
Damn it. Michael said
he'd be home all night,

25:06.861 --> 25:10.009
but I can't locate him or Max.
That's not normal.

25:10.034 --> 25:12.220
Wherever they are, they
must not have any service.

25:12.825 --> 25:15.711
I know a dead zone. I think
I know where they might be.

25:15.736 --> 25:17.266
I have to go.

26:28.137 --> 26:29.926
- Liz...
- Max!

26:29.951 --> 26:31.925
Michael, are you guys okay?

26:33.514 --> 26:35.136
Not really.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.865
- You look...
- If you were on time,

26:48.890 --> 26:50.943
you would've been stunned.

26:55.807 --> 26:58.696
And maybe you guys can
make out about it after

26:58.721 --> 27:00.153
we talk about the fact that a murderer

27:00.178 --> 27:02.664
just tried to bury us alive
in a bunker full of poison.

27:05.239 --> 27:07.168
Okay, let's go. Come on.

27:16.753 --> 27:19.770
Did she wake up? No.
She's been stirring,

27:19.795 --> 27:21.551
- but she's still out.
- We need to get her out of here

27:21.575 --> 27:23.339
before the killer notices we're all MIA.

27:23.364 --> 27:24.809
No, you said

27:24.834 --> 27:26.872
the killer needs to have a
false sense of complacency,

27:26.896 --> 27:28.849
so he doesn't strike
before Ranchero Night.

27:28.874 --> 27:29.817
Go out to the party.

27:29.842 --> 27:31.401
No, I don't want to leave Maria alone.

27:31.426 --> 27:33.949
Let me. I swear I will explode

27:33.974 --> 27:36.697
anyone who comes near her with my brain.

27:42.246 --> 27:44.831
Aw, come on, DeLuca, wake up.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.418
You're no fun when you're quiet.

27:51.917 --> 27:54.049
Do you think the killer is here?

27:54.907 --> 27:56.108
You know, whoever

27:56.133 --> 27:59.583
locked us up wanted to keep
us away from this party,

28:00.088 --> 28:01.423
away from you

28:01.448 --> 28:03.645
or Isobel or Maria.

28:04.518 --> 28:07.438
I really hope they can see us right now.

You want some more water?

28:27.109 --> 28:30.127
You got to stop showing up

28:30.678 --> 28:32.356
Uh, I can go get Liz

28:32.381 --> 28:34.817
if you want me to leave.

28:34.842 --> 28:36.841

- I know,

28:52.693 --> 28:55.614
but when the thought occurred to me,

28:55.639 --> 28:57.270
I was relieved.

28:58.877 --> 29:01.692
Like... glad you were gonna be the one

29:01.717 --> 29:04.786
to mess this thing up first, not me.

29:06.658 --> 29:07.959
There is something in my heart

29:07.984 --> 29:09.833
that always wants to
make a break for it,

29:09.858 --> 29:12.880
- to leave, before...
- Before you get left.

29:13.690 --> 29:16.088
Doesn't take a scientist
to figure out why.

29:17.946 --> 29:19.800
I know your mom hurt you.

29:20.909 --> 29:23.061
So if you, if you want
to pump the brakes

29:23.086 --> 29:24.770
- on this...
- No.

29:25.246 --> 29:28.783
The truth is, you don't
make me feel safe

29:28.808 --> 29:30.479
or comfortable.

29:30.767 --> 29:33.069
You make me feel like I am teetering

29:33.094 --> 29:34.595
on the edge of a cliff,

29:34.620 --> 29:37.490
and... and

29:37.515 --> 29:40.785
I'm getting addicted to that feeling.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.824
It's overwhelming.

29:43.958 --> 29:45.452
But if I mess up,

29:45.477 --> 29:48.205
if I cave and take off again,

29:49.297 --> 29:52.125
I need you to follow me this time.

29:53.821 --> 29:56.473
Don't let me go that easily again, okay?

29:56.984 --> 29:58.526
I... I never would have
in the first place,

29:58.551 --> 30:01.551
if I didn't think it
was what you wanted.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.747
I'll go check on Maria.

30:40.023 --> 30:41.224
Hey.

30:41.883 --> 30:42.884
You're up.

30:42.909 --> 30:43.910
Mm.

30:43.935 --> 30:45.036
You okay?

30:46.912 --> 30:50.349
I thought maybe Max stole my date.

30:50.374 --> 30:51.642
Never.

30:53.452 --> 30:57.274
Dad, can we talk about a
path to citizenship now?

30:58.209 --> 30:59.942
I've decided...

31:01.289 --> 31:02.696
you were right.

31:03.755 --> 31:07.701
A friend has agreed to help
protect me through the process.

31:11.657 --> 31:13.174
Sorry, I know this is a bad time,

31:13.199 --> 31:15.134
- but I need to ask you something.
- Max.

31:15.159 --> 31:17.946
It's fine. What's up?

31:18.136 --> 31:19.771
Cinco de Mayo.

31:20.389 --> 31:22.883
A witness saw you fighting with Carla,

31:23.114 --> 31:26.446
- one of my murder victims, outside.
- Carla...

31:26.480 --> 31:28.749
Mm, you don't want to know.

31:30.601 --> 31:33.463
I went outside just in time
to see her about to leave

31:33.488 --> 31:36.478
with someone she shouldn't
have left with.

31:37.506 --> 31:39.649
I didn't know she was
one of your victims.

31:41.688 --> 31:43.320
Who was it, DeLuca?

31:43.345 --> 31:44.987
Someone married.

31:45.012 --> 31:46.697
Married to who?

31:49.082 --> 31:50.779
You're friends with Noah Bracken?

31:50.804 --> 31:53.118
His firm volunteers at Ranchero Night.

31:53.143 --> 31:54.509
They give legal advice to people

31:54.534 --> 31:56.196
who need help with the process.

31:56.221 --> 31:58.095
He's a good man.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.073
It just doesn't make sense.

32:21.098 --> 32:23.034
Noah's like a human golden retriever.

32:23.059 --> 32:24.401
Fetch, sit, stay.

32:24.426 --> 32:26.124
I was at Grant Green's
warehouse because of him

32:26.149 --> 32:27.947
- the night that Wyatt attacked.
- If you're looking

32:27.972 --> 32:29.974
for alien scoop, Grant
Green's got all his stuff

32:29.999 --> 32:31.653
in storage during the renovations.

32:31.678 --> 32:34.428
After that, he told me to
stop investigating Wyatt.

32:34.452 --> 32:35.320
Listen, you're gonna want

32:35.345 --> 32:36.489
to lay off Wyatt Long.

32:36.514 --> 32:37.530
They're gonna come after

32:37.555 --> 32:39.053
the people you care about.

32:39.078 --> 32:40.835
I thought he was protecting me, but...

32:41.184 --> 32:43.338
maybe it was a threat.

32:46.260 --> 32:47.694
Okay, okay, so he...

32:47.719 --> 32:49.842
incepted my barista to destroy my lab

32:49.867 --> 32:52.203
to get the last of my serum,
collect the antidote.

32:52.228 --> 32:54.390
No, wait, he got shot.

32:54.615 --> 32:56.417
It's a perfect cover.

32:57.230 --> 32:58.644
I don't know, though.

32:58.880 --> 32:59.830
He just doesn't

32:59.855 --> 33:01.635
- seem that tough.
- Spin.

33:02.026 --> 33:04.067
That's perfect.

33:04.103 --> 33:06.229
You know, there's a way to find out.

33:18.637 --> 33:20.669
You mind if I steal a
dance with my sister?

33:20.801 --> 33:23.458
Oh, honestly, I'm surprised
you didn't ask earlier.

33:23.483 --> 33:24.927
Thanks.

33:38.915 --> 33:40.383
I need you to keep calm.

33:40.408 --> 33:42.610
But have you ever gotten
into Noah's head?

33:43.187 --> 33:45.345
I trust my husband, Max.

33:45.370 --> 33:47.105
How much?

33:48.819 --> 33:50.154
Please tell me you're not suggesting

33:50.179 --> 33:52.115
what I think you're suggesting.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.633
You're probably right.

33:58.729 --> 34:01.291
But maybe you could do
your brain warp thing

34:01.722 --> 34:03.960
and make sure it's as
crazy as it sounds.

34:04.926 --> 34:06.494
You're in total control in there.

34:06.556 --> 34:08.355
So he can't lie to you, right?

34:08.483 --> 34:09.841
No.

34:09.924 --> 34:13.803
I'm sorry, I promised him today
that I would not use my powers.

34:16.534 --> 34:18.161
He made me promise.

34:18.540 --> 34:20.141
- I need to get you out of here.
- No.

34:20.243 --> 34:22.369
I will get into his mind
and I will prove to you

34:22.393 --> 34:23.922
that he is a good man...

34:23.947 --> 34:25.382
who deserves better than this.

34:25.408 --> 34:26.565
Iz...

34:40.123 --> 34:42.371
Everything good with Max?

34:49.550 --> 34:52.510
Do you still love me now
that you know the truth?

34:55.565 --> 34:58.014
Did you mean what you said?

35:00.760 --> 35:01.961
Yes.

35:03.167 --> 35:05.479
I will never let anyone hurt you.

35:06.917 --> 35:10.025
I will protect you always.

35:23.057 --> 35:25.466
Get off me. It's not my blood.

35:35.831 --> 35:37.721
That's not what I asked.

35:39.784 --> 35:41.891
Do you love me, Noah?

35:42.552 --> 35:44.936
We're so connected, you and I.

35:46.391 --> 35:50.190
We have been since the first
time I heard your voice.

35:50.742 --> 35:53.027
That's not what I asked you.

35:54.971 --> 35:56.905
Answer my question.

35:59.531 --> 36:01.243
Do you love...?

36:03.318 --> 36:06.040
Did you love Rosa Ortecho?

36:10.904 --> 36:12.922
Of course I did.

36:13.818 --> 36:15.384
I still do.

36:17.603 --> 36:19.678
I always will.

36:30.558 --> 36:32.894
No. I told you not to go digging.

36:32.919 --> 36:34.236
No.

36:34.807 --> 36:37.197
All you had to do...

36:37.761 --> 36:40.297
was keep your promise to
stop using your powers.

36:42.348 --> 36:43.785
I'm sorry, Iz.

36:45.336 --> 36:47.540
I know you think...

36:48.036 --> 36:50.585
you're in control in here.

36:51.825 --> 36:55.225
But I'm in control out there.

37:02.484 --> 37:04.353
Max knows.

37:06.934 --> 37:09.515
He will never let you
get away with this.

37:09.540 --> 37:11.147
He will...

37:23.005 --> 37:24.772
if you tell him to.

37:40.543 --> 37:42.143
It's not him.

37:42.168 --> 37:43.264
You got into his head?

37:43.289 --> 37:45.641
Yes. He's innocent.

37:46.621 --> 37:48.339
Now, if you'll excuse me,

37:48.364 --> 37:49.731
I'm gonna go have a
quickie with my husband

37:49.756 --> 37:51.521
in the crop circle exhibition.

37:53.076 --> 37:54.161
Isobel...

37:59.434 --> 38:01.094
Hey, Liz. It's not him.

38:01.119 --> 38:02.610
It's him, it's Noah.

38:02.821 --> 38:04.600
No, that-that's impossible.

38:04.625 --> 38:06.764
I am looking at his blood
under a microscope right now.

38:06.789 --> 38:07.997
Max, it's him.

38:08.044 --> 38:09.384
Noah is the fourth alien.

38:09.940 --> 38:11.249
Isobel.

38:12.067 --> 38:13.195
Hey.

38:13.490 --> 38:15.294
Look, now, you're not you.

38:15.319 --> 38:17.087
I know my sister...

38:17.922 --> 38:19.788
and you're not Isobel.

38:23.681 --> 38:26.042
You're never gonna let
go of her, are you?

38:26.620 --> 38:28.755
Noah.

38:33.156 --> 38:35.564
You don't want to hit your sister?

38:41.749 --> 38:44.868
Cowboy chivalry was always
gonna be your downfall.

38:51.213 --> 38:53.041
Brought a gun to a fistfight?

38:54.315 --> 38:56.878
I am gonna destroy you, Noah.

39:00.933 --> 39:03.081
It's already over.

39:07.933 --> 39:10.266
Max won't hurt you, but I will.

39:41.912 --> 39:43.924
Let's go home, darling.

39:45.006 --> 39:47.884
I think it's time we
spend some time alone.

40:14.758 --> 40:16.640
You just can't walk away, can you?

40:16.665 --> 40:18.488
Hmm?

40:30.099 --> 40:31.972
Let go of me!

40:33.721 --> 40:35.559
No!

40:51.630 --> 40:54.036
Sucks to be powerless, doesn't it?

41:25.739 --> 41:27.158
Max?
