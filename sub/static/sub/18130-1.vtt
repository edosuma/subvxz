02:28.581 --> 02:30.249
<i>- This is the story</i>

02:30.250 --> 02:33.252
<i>of the first and last time
I ever fell in love.</i>

02:34.421 --> 02:36.422
<i>Let me start
with a little background</i>

02:36.423 --> 02:38.257
<i>so that you can
understand exactly</i>

02:38.258 --> 02:39.658
what I've been through here.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.660
It's a boy!

02:42.696 --> 02:44.163
<i>- My name is Charles Bellow,</i>

02:44.164 --> 02:45.664
but you can call me Charlie.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.001
<i>I was born
in French Lick, Indiana,</i>

02:49.002 --> 02:50.502
which sounds like it could be

02:50.503 --> 02:52.738
<i>kind of a cool,
scandalous place to be from,</i>

02:52.739 --> 02:53.939
<i>but it's not.</i>

02:53.940 --> 02:55.541
Uh, there's nothing French

02:55.542 --> 02:57.409
<i>and trust me,
nothing is licked.</i>

02:57.410 --> 02:59.211
My parents, Roger and Kitty,

02:59.212 --> 03:02.181
<i>are the nicest people
you'd ever want to meet,</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:04.950
<i>and I'm not just using
an expression there.</i>

03:04.951 --> 03:07.386
<i>If you met people any nicer
than this,</i>

03:07.387 --> 03:08.987
it would just upset you.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.291
- Give the nice
lady a seat.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.325
- OK!
- There you go.

03:13.326 --> 03:15.361
<i>- I was taught to emulate
that niceness,</i>

03:15.362 --> 03:17.696
<i>and to reasonably expect
it from other people.</i>

03:17.697 --> 03:19.098
You can have my seat,
ma'am.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.099
- Thank you, dear.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.600
<i>- Now, that second part there,</i>

03:21.601 --> 03:25.337
uh, that's where you can
get into a little trouble.

03:25.338 --> 03:27.673
<i>When I was accepted at
Vanderweil University,</i>

03:27.674 --> 03:28.941
<i>it was the fulfillment</i>

03:28.942 --> 03:30.976
<i>of a dream my parents
had had since...</i>

03:32.012 --> 03:34.113
- Oh! OK.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.280
OK.

03:35.281 --> 03:37.716
<i>-...well, since
the very beginning.</i>

03:40.020 --> 03:41.020
- All right.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.024
<i>- A Bellow was going to college.</i>

03:45.025 --> 03:47.059
<i>A Bellow was majoring
in business,</i>

03:47.060 --> 03:50.529
so that a Bellow could then
go on to become a middle manager

03:50.530 --> 03:52.531
<i>in a fine
American corporation...</i>

03:53.667 --> 03:55.801
<i>Maybe even
the Tiller King Company,</i>

03:55.802 --> 03:58.704
<i>whose tractors my father
repaired for a living.</i>

03:58.705 --> 04:00.039
<i>I shared their dream.</i>

04:00.040 --> 04:03.042
<i>I promised them
that I would not let them down,</i>

04:03.043 --> 04:07.112
that the Bellow-family boulder
was about to get a serious shove

04:07.113 --> 04:08.681
up the evolutionary hill.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.685
Hi.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.656
Hi.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.559
They were counting on me.

04:23.296 --> 04:26.465
Lord, how they were counting.

04:26.466 --> 04:27.866
Hi.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.670
Hi.

04:31.671 --> 04:34.273
<i>Everything was on track
in my undergraduate years,</i>

04:34.274 --> 04:37.109
<i>and I was lucky enough
to get into business school.</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:38.477
And then I got word that

04:38.478 --> 04:41.613
<i>my cousin Bart
had passed away... suddenly.</i>

04:43.616 --> 04:45.884
- Death, man.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.391
Death sucks.

04:54.361 --> 04:57.496
- Glad you were a
philosophy major there, Leo.

04:57.497 --> 05:00.599
- Sorry. The death unit
was back in freshman year.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.736
Meantime, we should probably
just try to cheer ourselves up

05:03.737 --> 05:05.738
by sticking to
happier subjects...

05:05.739 --> 05:07.106
like sex.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.408
Wanna play the game, huh?

05:09.409 --> 05:10.642
- Sure.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.078
- Yes.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.113
Yes.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.247
Yes.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.415
Yes.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.017
Yes!

05:18.018 --> 05:19.585
Yes.
- OK, OK, OK, OK.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.353
Let's play this way.

05:21.354 --> 05:25.290
Are there any women here
who you would not sleep with?

05:25.291 --> 05:27.359
- Probably.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.727
- Fair enough.

05:28.728 --> 05:31.530
- Charlie, I'm a young male
at or near my sexual peak.

05:31.531 --> 05:34.833
Don't hate me for following
my evolutionary blueprint.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.036
- Oh, I do not.
- Hell, yes!

05:37.037 --> 05:38.504
- I just, uh, I think it's--

05:38.505 --> 05:41.273
I think it's suspect that
you could know in a second

05:41.274 --> 05:43.609
whether or not you
would sleep with a woman.

05:43.610 --> 05:46.945
For me-- For me, those
decisions take a little thought.

05:46.946 --> 05:50.716
- That's why you've only slept
with 3 women in 4 years!

05:50.717 --> 05:52.351
- What, are you taking notes?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.385
- Yes!

05:53.386 --> 05:54.553
- Damn you!

05:54.554 --> 05:56.989
I just have other priorities
right now, you know?

05:56.990 --> 05:59.124
- I mean--
- Whoa! Careful, Charlie!

05:59.125 --> 06:02.361
If the death of your cousin
teaches us anything,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.329
it's that we must live!

06:05.331 --> 06:08.233
Live, Charlie! Live!

06:08.234 --> 06:09.968
- Live, you say.

06:09.969 --> 06:10.969
- Yes!

06:10.970 --> 06:11.970
- Yes.

06:11.971 --> 06:14.340
- Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.075
Yes!

06:16.076 --> 06:17.876
In your dreams, pervert!

06:17.877 --> 06:20.979
- I mean, you might like it!
It might even be good for you.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.114
- It might.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.816
- I mean, do you
seriously claim

06:23.817 --> 06:26.985
there is no woman within your
field of vision at this moment

06:26.986 --> 06:29.355
with whom you would sleep,
no questions asked?

06:30.890 --> 06:32.991
- Excuse me, but you should be!

06:32.992 --> 06:34.860
- OK, I'm sorry.

06:34.861 --> 06:35.861
- I...

06:38.098 --> 06:40.065
I'm outta here.

06:41.634 --> 06:43.268
- Just go.

06:43.269 --> 06:44.903
- Wow, you open big!

06:46.606 --> 06:48.140
- Yeah, go ahead.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.209
- Course she's hammered...

06:50.210 --> 06:52.811
or not particularly
coordinated,

06:52.812 --> 06:55.080
but very hot.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.217
Good call, Charlie.
Definite "yes".

06:58.218 --> 07:01.086
- I'm not even saying that
I would sleep with her.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.422
- Well, you're staring at her
pretty good.

07:03.423 --> 07:07.059
- I would talk to her.
Uh, I would, uh...

07:09.029 --> 07:11.063
- You would, uh...

07:11.064 --> 07:12.731
- Uh, get to know her.
Um...

07:15.568 --> 07:16.969
- OK!

07:16.970 --> 07:19.571
- You know what? You live
your way, I'll live mine.

07:19.572 --> 07:20.572
- Fine!

07:20.573 --> 07:21.807
- Fine!

07:21.808 --> 07:24.076
- Go begin
to get to know her then.

07:24.077 --> 07:28.047
- Not today. I gotta pay
a condolence call to my aunt.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.081
- Ugh.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.849
- Let her pinch my cheek,

07:30.850 --> 07:33.619
tell me how much
I look like my cousin.

07:33.620 --> 07:38.290
Oh! Besides, she actually has
a girl she wants me to meet.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.658
- You see, Charlie?

07:39.659 --> 07:43.228
Everyone you know,
even your bereaved aunt,

07:43.229 --> 07:45.597
is telling you
the same thing.

07:45.598 --> 07:46.899
Live. Yes.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.933
- Thank you.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.702
# Whistle #

07:58.178 --> 08:01.980
- Yes, I'm free
and I'm loving it!

08:06.686 --> 08:09.521
Train, where are you?

08:09.522 --> 08:11.490
Whoo-wee!

08:13.326 --> 08:15.594
Choo-choo!
Choo-choo-choo!

08:21.801 --> 08:23.268
Ah!

08:27.874 --> 08:30.676
- Hey! Hey!

08:30.677 --> 08:32.378
- Get off me!

08:32.379 --> 08:35.614
<i>- Once in your life
if you are very lucky,</i>

08:35.615 --> 08:38.683
<i>you will meet the person
who divides it...</i>

08:38.684 --> 08:41.820
<i>into the time
before you met her</i>

08:41.821 --> 08:43.688
<i>and the time after.</i>

08:43.690 --> 08:46.992
<i>But she was, you know,
obviously big trouble,</i>

08:46.993 --> 08:49.962
and--and I would've just
left it at that, except...

08:49.963 --> 08:51.630
- Hey.

08:51.631 --> 08:55.567
Hey! Give the gentleman
your seat!

08:55.568 --> 08:56.769
Ha!

08:56.770 --> 08:58.804
- Give me a break, all right?

09:04.344 --> 09:06.111
- You're welcome.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.314
You're welcome.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.524
Darling.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.536
Purse.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.939
Purse!

10:14.247 --> 10:15.681
- OK.

10:15.682 --> 10:18.751
Not--not touching
you inappropriately.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.286
OK, good.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.921
I'm holding your waist.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.257
Very specifically avoiding...

10:25.258 --> 10:26.558
Yes.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.127
Don't want a lawsuit.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.262
OK.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.264
Oh! Hey, yeah!

10:32.265 --> 10:34.700
Hi! 5th and 11th.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.101
- Is she dead?

10:36.102 --> 10:37.970
- What? No!
She-- No!

10:37.971 --> 10:39.838
She's--
She's not, uh... she's OK.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.006
- OK.

10:42.008 --> 10:43.876
- It's my, uh, my sister.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.245
She's... good.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.887
Aw!

10:55.922 --> 10:58.090
Very heavy girl!
Not fat, just muscular.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.926
I would assume,
'cause you're dense, as in--

11:00.927 --> 11:02.594
Not stupid,
I mean, heavy.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.837
Hey!

11:13.573 --> 11:15.641
Behind you, Einstein!

11:16.643 --> 11:17.743
Open--open the window!

11:17.744 --> 11:19.745
- What are you doing
on the fire escape?

11:19.746 --> 11:21.146
- Just open the window, man!

11:21.147 --> 11:23.549
- That's the girl from
before. You drugged her?

11:23.550 --> 11:24.550
Are you crazy?
- No!

11:24.551 --> 11:25.584
- Did anyone see you?

11:25.585 --> 11:27.653
- Just the lobby guard
and the rickshaw guy.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.788
- This is what happens
to the repressed ones.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.157
One day they just snap!
Why'd you bring her here?

11:32.158 --> 11:33.792
- She was passed out
in the subway!

11:33.793 --> 11:36.362
- I said talk to her,
not knock her unconscious.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.363
Just-- here.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.165
Head first. Head first.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.166
- OK.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.301
- Watch her head.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.802
- Just give ma second.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.170
- Come on!
- OK, OK.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.872
- Oh, there you are.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.173
- OK, she likes me.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.677
Oh, she smells
like tequila.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.646
- Let's keep her alive.

11:54.647 --> 11:55.948
- OK!

11:57.751 --> 12:00.352
- This is a very limp girl.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.754
- Oh boy!

12:02.889 --> 12:04.323
Oh boy!

12:04.324 --> 12:07.226
- Well, we're in trouble.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.527
- Purse.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.465
- So you brought her home?

12:13.466 --> 12:16.969
- I couldn't very well leave
her on a subway bench, right?

12:16.970 --> 12:20.072
- Which makes this,
technically, kidnapping.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.309
- Eventually, she will wake up,

12:24.310 --> 12:27.646
she will take the walk
of shame out of here

12:27.647 --> 12:29.281
and that'll be that.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.054
- So, did you
talk to her?

12:36.356 --> 12:37.890
- Not really.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.092
- What's she like?
Is she nice?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.729
- I'm not sure, but...

12:43.730 --> 12:45.197
I don't think so.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.470
- Security.
Open the door!

12:51.471 --> 12:55.174
- We aren't even in real jail.
We're in university jail.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.175
- I know.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.676
This is so humiliating!

12:57.677 --> 12:58.677
- Hey, Bellow!

12:58.678 --> 13:00.646
Oh, I'm gonna be watching you!

13:00.647 --> 13:02.281
You're on my radar!

13:02.282 --> 13:03.582
- OK, um, I--I understand

13:03.583 --> 13:06.418
and I thank you f-for
following due process on this--

13:06.419 --> 13:07.419
- Go, Charlie!

13:07.420 --> 13:09.555
- I respect what
you're doing. Thank you!

13:09.556 --> 13:10.556
- Watch it, Bellow!

13:11.691 --> 13:12.691
- Hello.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.059
<i>- Who are you?</i>

13:14.060 --> 13:15.094
- Uh, who are you?

13:15.095 --> 13:16.228
- Who are you?

13:16.229 --> 13:17.463
- Who are you?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.598
- I'm the girl you abducted
this afternoon.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.901
- Oh! Um, how did you
get this number?

13:22.902 --> 13:26.271
- Oh, security was only
too happy.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.273
I have all your information!

13:28.274 --> 13:29.975
- Why are you
asking me who I am?

13:29.976 --> 13:31.443
<i>- I'm not asking who you are.</i>

13:31.444 --> 13:33.412
I'm asking
who you think you are.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.247
- You know what?
I don't have time--

13:35.248 --> 13:38.317
- Meet me at the Spike Gallery,
6th and 4th.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.618
<i>- Um, no.</i>

13:39.619 --> 13:41.120
- Why not?

13:41.121 --> 13:43.422
- Because the
Tiller King representative

13:43.423 --> 13:45.190
is coming to campus this week.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.925
- Yeah, be there at 7:13.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.464
- Definitely not nice.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.186
- Charles Bellow.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.155
- Charlie.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.356
- Hmm.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.324
I'll take a red.

14:19.325 --> 14:20.592
- Ah!

14:20.593 --> 14:23.095
- Red for the lady.
And for you, sir?

14:23.096 --> 14:25.297
- Um, I--

14:25.298 --> 14:28.334
I think the--
I think the white.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.035
So red, yeah.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.036
- OK then.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.037
- So what happened?

14:32.038 --> 14:33.038
- Well, you, uh--

14:33.039 --> 14:34.039
- I can't hear you.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.441
- You were completely drunk.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.242
You almost fell
on the subway track.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.178
I pulled you back
at the last instant.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.380
You called me darling,
then you passed out.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.781
I assumed responsibility.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.516
I carried you back to my place

14:44.517 --> 14:47.886
and somebody called security
on us-- on me-- on-- for you.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.188
- I called you darling?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.423
- Yeah.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.625
- I think I remember that.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.499
But I seriously
doubt the rest of it.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.605
Jordan Roark.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.606
- Rork.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.575
- Roark.
R-O-A-R-K, Roark.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.576
- OK.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.012
- What are you studying?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.079
- Uh, business.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.080
- Are you smart?

15:16.349 --> 15:18.217
- Uh, maybe a little.
I don't know.

15:18.218 --> 15:22.287
- Well, most smart
people are smart enough

15:22.288 --> 15:25.257
not to have
to study business.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.227
Thank you...

15:28.228 --> 15:31.363
for not leaving me on
the subway bench, Charles.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.498
- You're welcome.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.600
Um, and it's--
it's Charlie, please.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.636
Uh, am I allowed to ask you

15:37.637 --> 15:41.774
why you were dead drunk in
the middle of the afternoon?

15:41.775 --> 15:45.077
- Goin' through
a reckless phase.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.879
- And wh-- by that,
you mean...

15:46.880 --> 15:48.247
- Don't know what it means?

15:48.248 --> 15:49.314
- No, I--

15:49.315 --> 15:51.150
- Guess you're
really not smart!

15:51.151 --> 15:53.085
- I know what the word means,

15:53.086 --> 15:55.754
I'm--I'm asking you
what--what you mean.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.489
- What do you care, Chuck?

15:58.525 --> 16:01.226
- Charlie!
And um, I'm interested.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.796
- Chuck. Chuck. Chuck.
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.066
Chuck! Chuck!

16:07.067 --> 16:08.067
- OK, um...

16:09.069 --> 16:10.502
I'm gonna go, Jordan.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.505
Uh, I hope that you get
through your reckless phase

16:13.506 --> 16:15.674
and that you have
a relatively happy

16:15.675 --> 16:18.444
and disaster-free
rest of your life.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.179
Um, goodbye.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.415
- My fiancée broke up with me.

16:28.955 --> 16:32.157
Uh... Uh, it's OK.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.292
Here.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.361

16:35.362 --> 16:37.096
What are you, an asthmatic?

16:37.097 --> 16:40.032
- No, I-- Where I'm from,
people carry handkerchiefs.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.501
- Where are you from? 1850?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.169
Is it clean?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.270
- Yes.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.340
- Fine.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.045
Here.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.147
- No, you--you can keep that.

- OK, I'll, uh...

16:58.084 --> 16:59.385
Uh...

16:59.386 --> 17:01.754
-...we can get them
away for a while.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.088
- You want some?

17:03.089 --> 17:05.023
- Yeah, thank you.
I, uh, OK.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.492
Why did he, uh, why--

17:07.527 --> 17:09.328
Why did he break up with you?

17:10.864 --> 17:12.097
- Well...

17:14.233 --> 17:15.768
I like bananas.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.301

Just to make sure.

- Yeah.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.388
- Sir.

18:42.389 --> 18:45.224
- Hi, Jimmy.
How was your day?

18:45.225 --> 18:48.827
- Ah, you know, the usual.
Held some doors, said hello.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.095
- Is she gonna be OK?

18:50.096 --> 18:51.196
- Yes, sir.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.667
- Can you give her
some aspirin, some water?

18:54.668 --> 18:56.368
Yes, sir.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.870
- Thank you.

18:57.871 --> 18:59.872
- Uh, anytime there, Spanky!

18:59.873 --> 19:03.575
- Ah, yeah.
5th and 11th.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.513
Whoa!

19:07.514 --> 19:09.982
- We now have dealerships
in all 50 states,

19:11.384 --> 19:13.152
including Alaska and Hawaii.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.120
Now, of course,
we made our reputation

19:15.121 --> 19:17.122
on big, heavy farm machinery,

19:17.123 --> 19:19.324
but we also
have a line of mowers

19:19.325 --> 19:20.926
that is second to none.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.261
What?

19:22.262 --> 19:24.463
- Oh please,
oh please, oh please...

19:38.745 --> 19:42.448
- Is there a Charles Bellow
in this room?

19:42.449 --> 19:44.116
Damn it!

19:47.554 --> 19:48.554
- Yes, sir.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.855
- Mr. Bellow,

19:49.856 --> 19:53.058
I believe you'd better go
with this young lady.

19:53.059 --> 19:56.095
- I--I don't--
I don't...

19:56.096 --> 19:58.063

- Oh, Mr. Bellow,

19:59.399 --> 20:02.468
I believe you had better go
with this young lady.

20:02.469 --> 20:05.170
Now, if there is anything
we prize

20:05.171 --> 20:07.006
at the Tiller King Company,

20:07.007 --> 20:08.841
is a man with the strength

20:08.842 --> 20:11.543
to take responsibility
for his own actions.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.847
- Yes, sir.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.149
- Now...

20:23.189 --> 20:24.189
- Hi!

20:24.190 --> 20:25.190
- Hi. What--what--

20:25.191 --> 20:26.358
What are you doing here?

20:26.359 --> 20:27.359
- Come play with me!

20:27.360 --> 20:28.360
- What?

20:28.361 --> 20:30.462
- Come play with me.
It's a beautiful day.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.965
- No, I-- First of all,
I was in the middle of a--

20:32.966 --> 20:34.400
- No, I--I took care of that.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.235
- Yeah, whoa!
What did that note say?

20:36.236 --> 20:37.302
- Nothing.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.171
- No, what did the note say?

20:40.173 --> 20:42.207
- It said that I just found out

20:42.208 --> 20:44.410
that I'm pregnant
with your child.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.046
- No, don't scream,

20:47.047 --> 20:49.214
'because it's gonna
make it worse.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.316
- Why-- You don't--
You-- You--

20:52.452 --> 20:54.453
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

20:54.454 --> 20:55.454
That's--that's--

20:55.455 --> 20:57.790
that's the Tiller King
representative in there.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.158
That's my future in there!

20:59.159 --> 21:00.192
- Really?

21:00.193 --> 21:01.527
- Yes!

21:01.528 --> 21:02.528
- How sad!

21:03.563 --> 21:05.497
- I can't believe that you--

21:08.201 --> 21:09.702
- Well, fine!

21:09.703 --> 21:11.337
But as practical matter, Chuck,

21:11.338 --> 21:13.405
you really can't go
back in there now.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.241
So you might as well

21:16.242 --> 21:18.944
spend the rest of
the day with me!

21:40.867 --> 21:42.001

- OK.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.730
Tell the band to play on!

23:59.239 --> 24:01.907
Women and children first!

24:04.878 --> 24:06.679
- Aren't you cold?

24:06.680 --> 24:08.147
- I'm fine!

24:08.148 --> 24:10.382
Don't be
such a pussy, Jack.

24:10.383 --> 24:13.152
I'm was king of the world!

24:13.153 --> 24:14.553
<i>- I have to say</i>

24:14.554 --> 24:17.956
<i>I found the Rose/Jack
relationship a little troubling,</i>

24:17.957 --> 24:19.591
but I kept that to myself.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.093
- What? What do you--

24:21.094 --> 24:22.795
- Pick up that cigarette!

24:24.631 --> 24:25.898
- Hang-- hang on!

24:25.899 --> 24:27.766
- Get back here!

24:27.767 --> 24:31.070
All I want you to do
is pick up the cigarette!

24:31.071 --> 24:32.738
- You're a little bit nuts!

24:32.739 --> 24:35.841
- Come here!
- Get away from me!

24:35.842 --> 24:37.509
- Whoa!

24:40.447 --> 24:41.780
- Charlie! Oh!

24:42.916 --> 24:43.949
Are you OK?

24:43.950 --> 24:45.651
- Definitely not.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.654
- Hey! Fifty bucks
for your cart.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.956
- I love New York!

24:50.957 --> 24:53.392
- How's your head?
Is it OK?

24:53.393 --> 24:54.793
- I hear a hum.

24:55.929 --> 24:58.297
- So what did you think
of the treatment?

24:58.298 --> 25:00.499
- The-- I think--
Uh, I think--

25:00.500 --> 25:02.167
I think it's a love story,

25:02.168 --> 25:04.937
and that they should
be nicer to each other.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.705
- It's not a love story.

25:06.706 --> 25:10.209
Charlie, it's a story about how
men can't handle big trouble.

25:10.210 --> 25:13.379
- Um, well, I think
people are still gonna want

25:13.380 --> 25:14.813
to see them kiss.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.916
- Well, maybe people shouldn't
always get what they want!

25:17.917 --> 25:19.551
- I tried to tell him...

25:19.552 --> 25:20.552
- OK.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.521
- Look, don't patronize me,
Charlie, OK?

25:22.522 --> 25:24.890
You know what? Like I care
what you think anyway!

25:24.891 --> 25:27.326
- Don't make eye contact.
Don't look. Come on!

25:27.327 --> 25:29.194
- OK, you know what, Jordan?

25:29.195 --> 25:31.997
I--I--I like you.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.500
And the last 3 days have been,

25:34.501 --> 25:36.568
uh, some of the most
interesting--

25:36.569 --> 25:38.303
if not, painful-- of my life.

25:38.304 --> 25:42.408
But my brain is haemorrhaging
and my career is ruined

25:42.409 --> 25:45.010
and I just think it's
better if we part ways.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.011
- Ha!

25:47.113 --> 25:48.847
- OK, but your head'll clot.

25:48.848 --> 25:49.882
And you know what?

25:49.883 --> 25:52.818
Did you think that maybe
you were meant for better

25:52.819 --> 25:55.287
than a career with
the Tiller King Company?

25:55.288 --> 25:56.288
- No!

25:56.289 --> 25:57.289
- Here.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.357
- What? Where are we?

25:59.759 --> 26:01.827
- You're fine.

26:01.828 --> 26:03.896
You may have some
headaches for a while.

26:03.897 --> 26:05.497
- No shit!

26:05.498 --> 26:07.766
- Take Tylenol, not Advil.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.968
And, uh, don't go
to sleep tonight.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.136
- Really?

26:11.137 --> 26:13.539
- Yeah, you have
a level one concussion.

26:13.540 --> 26:14.707
Just in case.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.675
- OK.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.544
- And I think it would be best

26:18.545 --> 26:20.779
if you didn't
see my daughter again.

26:20.780 --> 26:25.217
- Um, you speaking as my doctor
or as her father?

26:26.953 --> 26:29.688
- Jordan tells me
that you're the young man

26:29.689 --> 26:31.590
that brought her
home the other night.

26:31.591 --> 26:32.958
- I am.

26:32.959 --> 26:36.061
- It seems to me that
whenever you two get together,

26:36.062 --> 26:38.764
someone becomes separated
from his senses.

26:44.170 --> 26:47.306
You're obviously
a bad influence on her.

26:47.307 --> 26:49.742
- I'm a bad influence on her?

26:49.743 --> 26:51.844
- Would you disagree?

26:53.346 --> 26:56.448
- No, sir, I would not.
Thank you.

26:59.419 --> 27:00.853
- I'm sorry about him.

27:00.854 --> 27:02.955
You know, ever since
the fiancée,

27:02.956 --> 27:05.557
he's been really
overprotective and--

27:05.558 --> 27:07.226
- Yeah, no, he's your dad.

27:07.227 --> 27:09.628
Um, you know,
he's just lookin' out for you.

27:16.136 --> 27:18.137
- Goodbye.

27:19.239 --> 27:20.939
- Goodbye.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.076
- Um...

27:25.845 --> 27:27.613
Take care of your head.

27:29.249 --> 27:31.116
- Yeah, you too.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.680
- You're intrigued by this girl?

28:01.681 --> 28:04.717
- No, no, I'm not.

28:04.718 --> 28:07.653
Who would be
intrigued by a hot,

28:07.654 --> 28:11.123
mysterious, passionate,

28:11.124 --> 28:14.259
possibly bi-polar, violent,

28:14.260 --> 28:16.428
drunken, arrogant, rude...

28:16.429 --> 28:18.030
woman?

28:18.031 --> 28:19.698
- There are people.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.434
- Don't go to sleep, man!
- Aw!

28:22.435 --> 28:26.271
- Don't sleep! The doctor
said I gotta stay up.

28:26.272 --> 28:29.174
- So don't go to sleep!
Leave me alone!

28:30.477 --> 28:32.945
<i>- The next few weeks
passed without incident.</i>

28:32.946 --> 28:36.382
Leo got to the Existentialists,
and rented Horny House-Fraus 6.

rehabilitating myself</i>

28:47.594 --> 28:49.528
and I want to spend it with you.

28:49.529 --> 28:53.532
You decide how, but it has
to be the best birthday ever.

28:55.001 --> 28:57.936
# Humming #

29:02.609 --> 29:04.109
# Humming #

29:04.110 --> 29:06.912
- Hey! Hey, kid, is this
a subway platform

29:06.913 --> 29:09.248
or your own personal
piece of drawing paper?

29:09.249 --> 29:11.417
- Mom!
- Um, he's like 5, Jordan.

29:11.418 --> 29:12.618
- What did I do wrong?

29:12.619 --> 29:14.720
- Some people are bad, Tommy.
- Well--

29:14.721 --> 29:16.155
- Like Uncle Herb in jail?

29:16.156 --> 29:17.389
- Hey, here's the game.

29:17.390 --> 29:20.492
When someone crosses that
red line with their left foot,

29:20.493 --> 29:21.493
I win.

29:21.494 --> 29:22.628
Right foot, you win.

29:22.629 --> 29:24.530
- OK, what do we win?

29:24.531 --> 29:27.132
- I don't know
What do you suggest?

29:28.134 --> 29:29.635
- A kiss?

29:29.636 --> 29:31.804
- A kiss.
A kiss, everybody!

29:31.805 --> 29:33.639
Can you believe it?
He wants a kiss!

29:33.640 --> 29:35.941
- OK, OK!
You decide what then.

29:35.942 --> 29:39.712
- I was thinking,
like, a slap.

29:39.713 --> 29:41.714
- Like you need
a game for that?

29:41.715 --> 29:43.949
- Well, you can slap me too!
- I don't want--

29:43.950 --> 29:45.084
Why would I want--

29:45.085 --> 29:47.052
- Just-- Shh!
Here we go. Here we go.

29:47.053 --> 29:48.821
<i># Whistling Pachelbel's Canon #</i>

29:58.798 --> 30:00.499
Is that what you call a slap?

30:00.500 --> 30:02.101
- I--I'd call it not wanting--

30:02.102 --> 30:04.269
You didn't see what foot--

30:04.270 --> 30:05.738
- Yes, I did.

30:05.739 --> 30:07.539
- You were looking at me!
- Was not!

30:07.540 --> 30:09.208
- He came from
the other direction!

30:09.209 --> 30:10.743
- We never specified direction!

30:10.744 --> 30:12.811
- OK, well, you're--

30:15.682 --> 30:16.782
- Hey, no blocking!

30:21.788 --> 30:22.888
Oh boy!

30:45.211 --> 30:47.479

30:47.480 --> 30:48.480
Stop it! Stop it!

30:48.481 --> 30:49.815
- Truce! Truce.
- Truce?

30:49.816 --> 30:52.618
- Help a poor marching
band get a new tuba?

30:54.154 --> 30:55.487
All right! Thanks, man!

30:58.024 --> 31:00.559
- You're too kind
for your own good.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.327
- You know what?

31:02.328 --> 31:04.730
I know...

31:04.731 --> 31:07.966
that you don't
really want to hurt me.

31:07.967 --> 31:11.704
- Well, I know that you deserved
every slap that you got.

31:11.705 --> 31:14.039
- I know you don't mean that.

31:29.122 --> 31:30.823
- Game over.

31:30.824 --> 31:32.191
- I got you, don't worry.

31:32.192 --> 31:33.192
- Here.

31:33.193 --> 31:34.760
- You're falling.
Hey, got--

31:34.761 --> 31:37.262
- What kind of
stupid idea is this? Whoa!

31:37.263 --> 31:38.597
- Jesus!
OK, you're good.

31:38.598 --> 31:40.666
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Just let go.

31:40.667 --> 31:42.601
- Let go! Let go!
- You want-- you sure?

31:42.602 --> 31:43.602
OK, here.

31:43.603 --> 31:44.603
- I'm fine.

31:44.604 --> 31:45.604
- OK.

31:45.605 --> 31:47.539
- Oh! OK.

- Here you go.

31:48.541 --> 31:49.541
- Thank you.

31:49.542 --> 31:51.610
- An amusement park, you know?

31:51.611 --> 31:52.878
I love amusement parks!

31:52.879 --> 31:54.480
- Yeah, but it's my birthday.

31:54.481 --> 31:56.482
- I know! That's why
we're at the--

31:56.483 --> 31:57.716
- Right.

31:57.717 --> 31:59.418
- The amusement... park.

31:59.419 --> 32:00.886
Come on! Come on!

32:08.028 --> 32:10.896
First in 10 from the Jets...

32:10.897 --> 32:13.365
- Why don't you think about it?
Want to keep track.

32:13.366 --> 32:14.933
Boom. Thank you.

32:14.934 --> 32:17.236
- You owe me one, Leo.

32:17.237 --> 32:19.071
A huge one.

32:19.072 --> 32:21.940
- T-minus 10 minutes
till music and fireworks.

32:21.941 --> 32:22.941
- Mmm.

32:27.313 --> 32:29.882
- It starts off kind
of slow, but it gets--

32:29.883 --> 32:31.050
- Ha! Oh my god!

32:52.072 --> 32:55.341
- Hands on your heads.
- Are you part of it? Because--

32:55.342 --> 32:58.610
- I said hands on your heads!
What are you doing here?

32:58.611 --> 33:01.046
- Uh, it's a very special
birthday celebration.

33:01.047 --> 33:02.514
What are you doing here?

33:02.515 --> 33:04.283
- I'm hiding out.

33:04.284 --> 33:07.419
- Great! This is really great.
- I'm not happy about it either.

33:13.693 --> 33:17.596
- Hands on your heads and move!

33:17.597 --> 33:19.865
- Best birthday ever.

33:21.234 --> 33:23.268
- "One should recall
what one owes--"

33:23.269 --> 33:25.471
- Hey! Hey!

33:29.109 --> 33:33.712
Was a crazy guy with a
machine gun part of the program?

33:34.714 --> 33:36.315
- No.

33:36.316 --> 33:38.650
- I'm just saying--
- But I asked for one thing.

33:38.651 --> 33:41.453
- When have you not had a good
time at an amusement park,

33:41.454 --> 33:42.554
besides this time?

33:42.555 --> 33:45.024
- Shut up!
What is your relationship?

33:45.025 --> 33:46.425
- We're just friends, sir.

33:46.426 --> 33:48.227
- Bullshit!

33:48.228 --> 33:50.362
One look at you two,
I know that's not true.

33:50.363 --> 33:53.165
- Give me my jacket.
Where's my manual?

33:53.166 --> 33:54.700
- I had a girlfriend too.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.669
- Oh, I'm not his girlfriend.

33:57.671 --> 33:59.171
- For a year and a half.

33:59.172 --> 34:03.142
But then, when I enlisted,
she left me for this Frenchman!

34:03.143 --> 34:05.310
Can you believe it?
A Frenchman!

34:05.311 --> 34:07.179
We had a dog!

34:07.180 --> 34:09.882
Yorkshire terrier.
Rufus.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.583
But you know what?
Fuck Rufus!

34:11.583 --> 34:14.085
'Cause he too
now seems to love the Frenchman!

34:14.087 --> 34:15.087
- Uh, who do I--

34:15.088 --> 34:16.355
- I gotta have my manual.

34:16.356 --> 34:17.389
- Hello? Hello?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.590
- Where's my manual?

34:18.591 --> 34:20.492
- So tonight, at lights out,

34:20.493 --> 34:21.694
grabbed my weapon,

34:21.695 --> 34:23.829
and I came to kill them,
Rufus included.

34:23.830 --> 34:25.864
But they weren't home.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.567
I have the worse luck.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.402
- I'm sorry.

34:32.906 --> 34:36.641
Had we known, we would've
gone to Six Flags.

34:38.578 --> 34:41.045
- I'm on hold.
- I got it! I found the manual.

34:41.047 --> 34:44.216
- I change my mind.
I'm not gonna kill them.

34:44.217 --> 34:46.418
- I'm gonna kill myself.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.487
- Uh, well, that's
sad to hear, but if--

34:48.487 --> 34:51.556
- You know, I heard when you
fire a bullet into your head,

34:51.558 --> 34:52.958
your entire skull explodes.

34:52.958 --> 34:54.560
You know, as opposed to this

34:54.561 --> 34:57.396
sort of little, red bullet-hole
thing you see in the movies.

34:57.397 --> 34:59.264
- What's the difference?
You're dead!

34:59.265 --> 35:00.466
- Why kill yourself?

35:00.467 --> 35:02.434
It's not gonna make her
come back to you.

35:02.435 --> 35:04.770
- But it'll put me
out of my misery.

35:04.771 --> 35:05.804
And it'll hurt her.

35:05.805 --> 35:07.673
She'll never be the same.

35:07.674 --> 35:10.709
- You're wrong, 'cause time
will pass, and she'll be fine.

35:12.112 --> 35:13.912
- How do you know?

35:13.913 --> 35:16.482
- Because that's
the way it works.

35:16.483 --> 35:18.250
- How do you know?

35:19.285 --> 35:20.853
- It has to be.

35:22.889 --> 35:24.490
- So then I'm screwed.

35:24.491 --> 35:27.326
If I kill myself, it
accomplishes nothing,

35:27.327 --> 35:28.527
plus I'm dead.

35:28.528 --> 35:30.896
If I don't, I get court-
martialled for desertion.

35:30.897 --> 35:33.565
- Of the two, I would go with
the court martial though.

35:33.566 --> 35:35.401
Good luck!
- You know what?

35:35.402 --> 35:38.003
Your eyebrows remind me
of the Frenchman's

35:38.004 --> 35:39.238
- Take me. Let her go.

35:39.239 --> 35:40.239
- What?

35:40.240 --> 35:41.707
- Jordan, it's been very nice

35:41.708 --> 35:43.175
getting to know you a little.

35:43.176 --> 35:44.943
Um, happy birthday.
- No.

35:44.944 --> 35:46.979
- This is between you and me.
Let her go.

35:46.980 --> 35:48.180
- Drop your weapon!

35:48.181 --> 35:50.015
- I will not!
You drop your weapons!

35:50.016 --> 35:52.484
- No, you drop your weapon!
- You drop your weapons!

35:52.485 --> 35:54.820
- Wait!
- You drop your weapon!

35:54.821 --> 35:57.523
- You can't make me!
- Yes, I can!

35:57.524 --> 35:59.258
- You drop your weapon!
- No, you!

35:59.259 --> 36:01.593
- Just wait a second!
Just please, wait!

36:01.594 --> 36:03.162
- No, you!
- Wait a minute!

36:03.163 --> 36:04.496
Listen to me!

36:04.497 --> 36:07.266
You're girlfriend, she
broke your heart, didn't she?

36:07.267 --> 36:09.268
- Yes!
- She left you.

36:09.269 --> 36:11.136
She broke her promise
and betrayed you.

36:11.137 --> 36:12.371
- Yes!
Yes, she did.

36:12.372 --> 36:13.939
- Some of us are
meant to suffer!

36:13.940 --> 36:15.374
Some of us are
led to believe

36:15.375 --> 36:17.076
that we have
this certain destiny,

36:17.077 --> 36:18.811
and then it just
gets snatched away.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.114
But we have to stay alive.

36:23.817 --> 36:26.051
Because we have to see...

36:27.487 --> 36:29.722
how the story ends.

36:33.460 --> 36:34.927
Right?

36:39.199 --> 36:40.833
Please.

36:48.308 --> 36:50.075
- Hey!

36:50.076 --> 36:52.378
If you're smart
you'll stay with her!

36:52.379 --> 36:55.314
She's a great girlfriend!
I can tell.

36:55.315 --> 36:57.149
Suspect is down!

36:57.150 --> 36:58.751
I say again:
suspect is down!

37:01.321 --> 37:03.589
- We're just friends.

37:05.158 --> 37:07.393
So that's what you think?

37:07.394 --> 37:09.995
- Not exactly, um,
I--I--I hadn't--

37:09.996 --> 37:11.797
I--I don't know what category.

37:11.798 --> 37:12.998
- Listen!

37:12.999 --> 37:14.900
We're seeing each other.

37:14.901 --> 37:17.202
- We are?
- Of course.

37:17.203 --> 37:18.871
- OK!

37:18.872 --> 37:21.373
<i>Her birthday was
an unmitigated disaster,</i>

37:21.374 --> 37:23.275
but all things considered...

37:23.276 --> 37:24.677
- Come on!

37:24.678 --> 37:26.578
<i>-...I felt pretty good,</i>

37:26.579 --> 37:28.647
<i>because I had seen
the depth of her soul,</i>

37:28.648 --> 37:30.716
<i>and I found out
we were seeing each other.</i>

37:31.718 --> 37:32.885
- Gotcha!

37:36.623 --> 37:38.590
- Hey! Let's do this.

37:38.591 --> 37:40.392
- Oh, yeah!

37:40.393 --> 37:41.727
- Oh!

37:41.728 --> 37:43.595
- Aah!
- Whoops!

37:43.596 --> 37:45.698
Oh! Wait!

37:53.139 --> 37:56.175
# Pachelbel's Canon #

38:01.514 --> 38:04.049
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

38:04.050 --> 38:06.618
<i>Some days with her were...
painful.</i>

38:06.619 --> 38:09.121
OK, Rork wins
- Roark!

38:09.122 --> 38:11.523
- So, are there
any questions about...

38:11.524 --> 38:13.992
<i>- But hours without her
were even worse.</i>

38:21.801 --> 38:24.036
Hi. Waiting.

38:30.410 --> 38:32.344
- You look just like him.

38:32.345 --> 38:34.246
- Uh, I've been told.

38:34.247 --> 38:35.481
- You're his brother?

38:35.482 --> 38:37.683
- Cousin.
- Ah!

38:37.684 --> 38:39.318
I miss him and your aunt.

38:39.319 --> 38:42.087
They came in here
every Sunday for years,

38:42.088 --> 38:44.356
always took
the same table.

38:44.357 --> 38:46.325
She's hardly
been back since.

38:46.326 --> 38:47.726
- Um--

38:47.727 --> 38:49.294
- You miss me?
- Yeah.

38:49.295 --> 38:50.562
- Great. Thank you!

38:50.563 --> 38:52.231
- Certainly.

38:52.232 --> 38:54.767
<i>- I have a present for you.</i>

38:54.768 --> 38:56.568
- Do you?

38:58.204 --> 38:59.972
- Ta-da!

39:01.608 --> 39:03.308
- Oh, good!

39:03.309 --> 39:05.544
- What?
You don't wanna read it?

39:05.545 --> 39:08.547
- No, I--I--
I most certainly do.

39:09.883 --> 39:11.717
Thank you.

39:11.718 --> 39:13.485
Bounty hunter.

39:13.486 --> 39:17.289
<i>- It's a Western!
And the outlaw's name is Chuck!</i>

39:18.458 --> 39:19.458
<i>- The heroine was</i>

39:19.459 --> 39:21.293
a mysterious bounty hunter,

39:21.294 --> 39:24.363
<i>who arrived one day
from parts unknown.</i>

39:24.364 --> 39:26.198
- The Bounty Hunter!
It's good title!

39:26.199 --> 39:27.766
- It's a great title!
- Read it.

39:27.767 --> 39:29.702
- I'm not good at
reading and talking.

39:29.703 --> 39:31.337
- Read it!
- OK, I'm reading it.

39:34.007 --> 39:36.542
- Are you reading it?
- I am, uh, reading it.

39:38.578 --> 39:40.045
- Just picture it, OK?

39:40.046 --> 39:42.014
Come on! Come on! Come on!

39:43.249 --> 39:44.383
Do-do-do! Do-do-do!

39:44.384 --> 39:45.951
Oh, how you'll like it!

39:47.020 --> 39:49.555
<i>- She kills him.
What a shock!</i>

39:49.556 --> 39:52.491
<i>Only then does she reveal
where she came from...</i>

39:52.492 --> 39:54.259
<i>The future.</i>

39:54.260 --> 39:56.595
- Isn't it great?

39:56.596 --> 39:59.898
- Ooh! It's, uh...
It is...

39:59.899 --> 40:01.533
It's is...

40:01.534 --> 40:03.802
Uh... question.

40:03.803 --> 40:08.507
Why, uh, why does the heroine
always come from the future?

40:08.508 --> 40:10.609
- Because I believe
in time travel.

40:10.610 --> 40:13.679
I believe that in the future
it's already been invented,

40:13.680 --> 40:17.116
and that there are people from
the future with us as we speak.

40:17.117 --> 40:19.251
And I think that one day,

40:19.252 --> 40:22.187
I will eventually meet
someone from the future.

40:25.592 --> 40:27.760
- I'm sure you will then.

40:27.761 --> 40:29.795
- I have another
present for you.

40:29.796 --> 40:31.830
- OK.

40:31.831 --> 40:33.532
What is that?

40:33.533 --> 40:36.301
- You've been granted an
interview with the vampire.

40:36.302 --> 40:39.505
A regional sales manager
named Mr. Phipps,

40:39.506 --> 40:43.409
who will be selecting
Tiller King management trainees.

40:43.410 --> 40:45.577
Drinks tomorrow.
His hotel.

40:45.578 --> 40:47.980
- OK, that is great news.

40:47.981 --> 40:49.882
Um, where did you get this?

40:49.883 --> 40:51.350
- Your mailbox.

40:51.351 --> 40:53.385
- You went through my mail?

40:53.386 --> 40:55.721
Why would you go--
That's illegal! You're not--

40:55.722 --> 40:58.724
- Are we gonna argue about that?
- Yes!

40:58.725 --> 41:01.160
- Or are you gonna have
a great dinner tonight,

41:01.161 --> 41:03.662
wake up tomorrow and have
an amazing interview

41:03.663 --> 41:06.065
and call me the second
that it's done.

41:11.671 --> 41:13.572
<i>- What a city, huh, Charlie?</i>

41:13.573 --> 41:17.109
- Yes, sir!
Yes, sir, Mr. Phipps.

41:23.183 --> 41:24.883
- You know,
I can never remember.

41:24.884 --> 41:26.785
Is the Bronx up
or the Battery down

41:26.786 --> 41:28.654
or the Battery up
and the Bronx down?

41:28.655 --> 41:29.688
- First one, I think.

41:29.689 --> 41:31.690
- Right! Right!

41:31.691 --> 41:32.791
Sure!

41:32.792 --> 41:34.393
- Drinks, gentlemen?

41:34.394 --> 41:35.928
- Diet Pepsi, please.

41:37.530 --> 41:39.098
- And for you?

41:40.433 --> 41:42.434
- 2 Diet Pepsis, comin' up!

41:43.937 --> 41:45.070
- So, Charlie!

41:45.071 --> 41:48.107
Your dad works at the
maintenance facility

41:48.108 --> 41:49.641
in French Lick?

41:49.642 --> 41:52.311
- Uh, 27 years, sir, yes.

41:52.312 --> 41:53.912
- Looked him up.

41:53.913 --> 41:56.582
He is a model employee.

41:56.583 --> 41:57.816
I mean, you only wish

41:57.817 --> 42:01.687
every employee was cut
from the same cloth!

42:01.688 --> 42:06.392
if you're a chip off
that block, let me tell you,

42:07.560 --> 42:10.362
I think your chances
are pretty good indeed.

42:10.363 --> 42:11.530
- Uh, that is--

42:11.531 --> 42:13.165
- All right!

42:13.166 --> 42:15.901
- Diet Pepsi for you.

42:15.902 --> 42:17.970
Diet Pepsi for you!

42:17.971 --> 42:19.405
Oops!

42:19.406 --> 42:21.273
And a double tequila for me!

42:21.274 --> 42:22.741
Charlie, push over.

42:22.742 --> 42:24.643
- You two know each other?

42:24.644 --> 42:27.946
- Uh, this, uh,
this is Mr. Phipps.

42:27.947 --> 42:30.449
This is Jordan Roark.
We are-- She--

42:30.450 --> 42:32.084
We're--
we're seeing each other.

42:33.520 --> 42:35.054
- Well!

42:35.055 --> 42:36.188
- Oh!

42:36.189 --> 42:38.290
- It's a pleasure to
meet you, Miss Roark.

42:38.291 --> 42:40.759
- Oh, well the pleasure
is all mine, Mr. Phipps.

42:42.028 --> 42:43.762
- To the Tiller King Company!

42:43.763 --> 42:45.164
- Yes, indeed!

42:45.165 --> 42:46.765
- Oh boy!

42:48.368 --> 42:50.402
- Oh!

42:50.403 --> 42:51.670
Oh.

42:51.671 --> 42:53.572
Dmitri!
Can I get another one?

42:53.573 --> 42:54.573
- Right away!

42:54.574 --> 42:57.242
- Oh, I'm sorry,
did you-- anything else?

42:57.243 --> 42:58.844
- No, no, no.
We're good.

42:58.845 --> 42:59.912
- Uh, Mr. Phipps--

42:59.913 --> 43:01.780
- How did you two
meet each other?

43:01.781 --> 43:03.282
- Uh--

43:03.283 --> 43:05.851
- Well, it depends
on who you believe.

43:05.852 --> 43:09.722
Either I got drunk and passed
out in the subway platform,

43:09.723 --> 43:11.090
or he drugged me.

43:12.992 --> 43:14.226
- She's so silly!

43:14.227 --> 43:15.794
- I see!

43:15.795 --> 43:17.096
- Tequila? Double?

43:17.097 --> 43:18.731
- Yes, thank you!

43:20.367 --> 43:22.968
To the Tiller King
Company! Whoo!

43:22.969 --> 43:24.136
- Righty-o!

43:24.137 --> 43:25.304
- Cheers!

43:25.305 --> 43:26.739
- Righty-o!

43:26.740 --> 43:28.907
- Um, as I was, uh...

43:28.908 --> 43:30.342
- Ah!

43:30.343 --> 43:32.678
-...saying about
the annual report, uh...

43:32.679 --> 43:34.546
- Dmitri! Another!

43:34.547 --> 43:35.581
- Got it!

43:35.582 --> 43:37.683
- Oh, there I go again.
Anyone else?

43:37.684 --> 43:39.318
- No.
- No, thank you.

43:39.319 --> 43:40.352
- Oh boy!

43:40.353 --> 43:41.487
- Um, I, uh--

43:41.488 --> 43:43.322
- How long have
you two been together?

43:43.323 --> 43:44.456
- Oh, not very long.

43:44.457 --> 43:46.692
We're still in
the beginning phases.

43:46.693 --> 43:48.427
I haven't seen his penis yet.

43:51.264 --> 43:52.698
- There you are!

43:52.699 --> 43:54.466
- Ha ha!
Tequila double.

43:54.467 --> 43:56.235
Thank you!

43:56.236 --> 43:58.637
Hey! Do not lose that bottle!

43:58.638 --> 44:00.239
- I won't!

44:00.240 --> 44:02.508
- To the King Killerton...

44:02.509 --> 44:04.343
Tiller King,
King Tiller. Whatever!

44:04.344 --> 44:05.911
Cheers.

44:08.581 --> 44:11.116
Oh god!

44:11.117 --> 44:12.718
- She's, um--

44:12.719 --> 44:14.386
- That is wrong, but so good!

44:14.387 --> 44:17.156
- She's-- She's uh...

44:17.157 --> 44:20.059
She's gone through
a lot recently.

44:20.060 --> 44:21.760
- Charlie?

44:21.761 --> 44:23.495
- Yeah, yeah.
You're-- You OK?

44:24.497 --> 44:25.798
Oh, OK.

44:25.799 --> 44:26.965
It's OK. It's OK.

44:26.966 --> 44:27.966
- Oh god!

44:27.967 --> 44:29.101
- I should get her--

44:29.102 --> 44:31.637
- Can I help you?
- No, no, no!

44:31.638 --> 44:35.674
It's easy as pie.
Um, a pleasure, sir.

44:37.043 --> 44:40.446
Really, I look forward to, um,
to--to hearing from you and--

44:40.447 --> 44:41.947
- Give me a call.

44:41.948 --> 44:44.750
- I'm gonna get her
outta here. I'm sorry.

44:44.751 --> 44:45.751
Bye!

44:45.752 --> 44:47.319
- To the Killer Ting!

44:47.320 --> 44:49.321
- Shh!

44:50.423 --> 44:52.524
<i>- I'm concerned, Charlie.</i>

44:52.525 --> 44:54.760
I mean, I get it.

44:54.761 --> 44:58.664
This girl's smart,
she's interesting,

44:58.665 --> 45:00.532
she's insanely hot,

45:00.533 --> 45:03.535
she's making you live.

45:03.536 --> 45:05.671
So what I'm going to say,

45:05.672 --> 45:08.707
should be heard within
that context.

45:08.708 --> 45:10.642
OK.

45:10.643 --> 45:13.379
She's a friggin' nut!

45:13.380 --> 45:16.315
She's bent on destroying you
in every way possible,

45:16.316 --> 45:19.118
your physical person,
your emotional person,

45:19.119 --> 45:20.419
your personal person!

45:20.420 --> 45:24.189
Add those things up,
that's a whole person!

45:24.190 --> 45:26.225
Now, there's something
to be said for being

45:26.226 --> 45:28.360
exquisitely tortured
and financially bled.

45:28.361 --> 45:30.029
As long as
it's by the right girl.

45:30.030 --> 45:33.132
What bothers me
is that while you do perform

45:33.133 --> 45:36.435
many of the traditional
functions of a boyfriend,

45:36.436 --> 45:38.904
you are not,
it is my understanding,

45:38.905 --> 45:40.105
sleeping with her.

45:40.106 --> 45:41.373
Is that correct?

45:41.374 --> 45:43.942
- You know, it is possible
for two people

45:43.943 --> 45:47.046
to have a relationship
without sleeping together.

45:47.047 --> 45:49.181
- Yes, and they have
a word for that.

45:49.182 --> 45:50.349
Friendship.

45:50.350 --> 45:52.384
- Oh, sure, yeah!
Where'd you get that?

45:52.385 --> 45:54.687
Your German porn collection?

45:54.688 --> 45:57.122
Everything will work
itself out in due time.

45:57.123 --> 45:59.258
She is still getting over
her break-up.

45:59.259 --> 46:00.659
- Forget about the sex then.

46:00.660 --> 46:03.195
Let's just talk about what
the sex brings with it:

46:03.196 --> 46:07.733
mainly, a little emotional
investment on her part.

46:07.734 --> 46:09.735
In the absence of which,

46:09.736 --> 46:12.905
she could really wind up
killing you, Charlie.

46:14.841 --> 46:16.141
<i>- OK, all right.</i>

46:16.142 --> 46:20.546
On the reasons-to-
stop-seeing-her side, we have

46:20.547 --> 46:23.148
One, on-going physical danger.

46:23.149 --> 46:25.951
Two, high likelihood
of a broken heart.

46:25.952 --> 46:29.955
Three, uh, career sabotage.

46:29.956 --> 46:34.226
Four, she is clinically insane.

46:34.227 --> 46:37.396
Five, she seems to enjoy
my pain.

46:37.397 --> 46:39.298
Six...

46:39.299 --> 46:43.335
14-piece match set of
Louis Vuitton emotional baggage.

46:44.738 --> 46:48.707
Seven, I haven't even
kissed her yet for god's sake!

46:48.708 --> 46:51.610
Uh, 5, 6, 7...

46:51.611 --> 46:54.013
Eight, she's ruining my life.

46:54.014 --> 46:57.049
- And the reasons
to keep seeing her?

46:59.919 --> 47:01.787
- I'm in love with her.

47:05.091 --> 47:06.825
- Hello.

47:08.395 --> 47:10.162
- I'm sorry about the interview.

47:10.163 --> 47:13.599
- Yeah, I really wish
you hadn't done that.

47:13.600 --> 47:16.835
I couldn't let you just give
your life and your brain

47:16.836 --> 47:18.303
<i>to those people.</i>

47:18.304 --> 47:21.607
- I want to give my life
and my brain to those people.

47:21.608 --> 47:23.208
- No, you don't!

47:23.209 --> 47:26.745
Just think of it as
me saving you from yourself.

47:26.746 --> 47:28.447
<i>- I see.</i>

47:28.448 --> 47:31.684
Come on, Charlie,
that's why human beings exist!

47:31.685 --> 47:33.952
To save each other
from ourselves.

47:35.889 --> 47:38.190
- It's an interesting theory.

47:40.760 --> 47:43.228
- I still wanna
make it up to you.

47:44.230 --> 47:46.799
Tomorrow's our 33rd day
since we met.

47:46.800 --> 47:48.400
- Is it?

47:48.401 --> 47:50.936
- Meet me at
Arts and Sciences, Room 105,

47:50.937 --> 47:53.205
at 1:00 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon.

47:53.206 --> 47:55.741
And bring a single red rose.

47:55.742 --> 47:57.176
- No! No!

47:57.177 --> 47:59.178
No! You know what?
You can't--

47:59.179 --> 48:02.581
You can't, uh,
just boss me around, you know?

48:02.582 --> 48:03.916
<i>Enough is enough.</i>

48:03.917 --> 48:06.185
Hello? Are you there?
Are you there?

48:06.186 --> 48:07.986
Hello? Hello?

48:10.190 --> 48:12.691
OK.

48:18.531 --> 48:20.332
- Aw, crap!

48:20.333 --> 48:22.134
Uh...

48:23.336 --> 48:26.805
OK, uh, one single red rose,
like she said.

48:43.957 --> 48:47.159
<i># Pachelbel's Canon #</i>

49:57.163 --> 49:59.431
# # #

50:06.573 --> 50:08.841
Whatever she was going through,

50:08.842 --> 50:11.910
<i>it was beyond anything
in my experience,</i>

50:11.911 --> 50:13.846
and beyond my ability to fix.

50:14.848 --> 50:17.516
I had no right to judge her.

50:17.517 --> 50:21.820
<i>If I chose to stay with her,
knowing the risks,</i>

50:21.821 --> 50:26.859
<i>all I could do
was give her love and respect...</i>

50:28.328 --> 50:30.829
and see how the story would end.

50:33.833 --> 50:36.435
# # #

51:02.462 --> 51:05.597
- I don't wear underwear
on days I play the piano.

51:05.598 --> 51:06.999
- Really.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.567
- Should we get out of here?

51:08.568 --> 51:09.568
- Yeah.
- Uh--

51:11.805 --> 51:13.806
Aw, my feet are killing me.

51:13.807 --> 51:16.642
- I could give
you a foot rub.

51:16.643 --> 51:18.877
- No, no, we'll
just exchange shoes.

51:20.580 --> 51:22.081
- What?

51:23.516 --> 51:25.017
- No!

51:26.019 --> 51:27.152
No!

51:27.153 --> 51:28.654
- Fine!

51:28.655 --> 51:29.988
- Fine!

51:33.493 --> 51:36.795
- # Dum-dee-dum-
dee-dee-do-dee #

51:38.398 --> 51:40.532
These aren't gonna work.

51:40.533 --> 51:41.867
- That's what I thought.

51:41.868 --> 51:44.636
We didn't know if it was
sleeping, or whatever,

51:44.637 --> 51:46.305
and so he was like:

51:46.306 --> 51:48.307
"Why don't you throw
a rock at it?"

51:48.308 --> 51:50.743
And I was like: "No,
you throw a rock at it.

51:50.744 --> 51:52.644
By this point,
we were only 7 years old.

51:52.645 --> 51:54.780
I didn't know if I was
right or left-handed--

51:54.781 --> 51:57.383
- I bet the water isn't very
deep. What do you think?

51:57.384 --> 52:00.552
- Uh, I was-- I was kind of
in the middle of a--

52:00.553 --> 52:02.955
I don't know.
I don't have any way to--

52:02.956 --> 52:06.492
- Why don't you come sit up here
and tell me what you think?

52:06.493 --> 52:08.427
- That's not gonna
help me fi--

52:08.428 --> 52:10.496
It's kind of
dangerous, actually.

52:10.497 --> 52:12.197
We can go to
tourist information,

52:12.198 --> 52:13.465
or maybe on the Internet.

52:13.466 --> 52:15.100
- Charlie, don't be
such a wuss!

52:15.101 --> 52:16.802
I just wanna know
how deep it is!

52:16.803 --> 52:17.803
- I'm not a wu--

52:17.804 --> 52:19.405
There's a sign!
It's forbidden!

52:19.406 --> 52:21.540
- Yeah, OK.
Just finish your story.

52:29.382 --> 52:30.649
- Whoa!

52:34.254 --> 52:35.587
- Whoopsie!

52:35.588 --> 52:37.623
- Why me?

52:37.624 --> 52:40.325
- Well, that's
surprisingly deep.

52:49.369 --> 52:51.103
Charlie!

52:54.808 --> 52:56.909
- OK, OK.

52:58.178 --> 53:00.245
- Was that deep enough for you?

53:00.246 --> 53:01.246
- So it's true?

53:01.247 --> 53:02.247
- What?

53:02.248 --> 53:05.117
- You don't wear
underwear on recital days.

53:05.118 --> 53:06.151
- I never lie.

53:21.067 --> 53:22.868
- Oh, wow!

53:39.352 --> 53:41.353
Oh! Damn it!

53:43.289 --> 53:44.423
- Yes! Yes!

53:44.424 --> 53:46.325
- Sorry.
I'm sorry!

53:46.326 --> 53:47.593
- Great!

53:47.594 --> 53:48.594
- Um, sorry.

53:48.595 --> 53:50.195
- Jordan.

53:50.196 --> 53:52.031
- It's late.

53:52.032 --> 53:53.699
- Could be worse.

53:53.700 --> 53:55.100
- Good night, young man.

53:55.101 --> 53:56.468
- It's OK.

53:57.937 --> 53:59.672
- I--I'm sorry.

53:59.673 --> 54:01.774
- I said goodnight, young man.

54:01.775 --> 54:02.941
- Dad, enough, OK?

54:02.942 --> 54:05.444
I'm allowed to have
whoever I want over.

54:05.445 --> 54:07.446
- I'm sick and tired of it.
I've had it!

54:07.447 --> 54:09.114
- I don't want to
hear it anymore!

54:09.115 --> 54:10.849
-...loss of control
over yourself!

54:10.850 --> 54:12.518
I told you not to
see him anymore!

54:12.519 --> 54:13.552
Do you understand me?

54:13.553 --> 54:15.654
- What you're trying
to do is not helping.

54:15.655 --> 54:17.656
- How do you know what
I'm trying to do?

54:17.657 --> 54:18.657
- You know what--

54:18.658 --> 54:20.592
- I'm trying to make
you responsible...

54:20.593 --> 54:22.194
<i># I've seen faces around #</i>

54:22.195 --> 54:24.830
<i>- I didn't hear from her
for a couple weeks.</i>

54:24.831 --> 54:26.832
<i># While many often
bring me down #</i>

54:26.833 --> 54:28.100
<i>Three weeks, actually.</i>

54:28.101 --> 54:29.201
<i># Spin me around... #</i>

54:29.202 --> 54:31.837
<i>And 4 days... 9 hours,</i>

54:31.838 --> 54:36.709
<i>20 minutes,
6 and a half seconds...roughly.</i>

54:36.710 --> 54:40.879
<i># This crazy situation's been
runnin' my mind... #</i>

54:44.417 --> 54:47.453
<i># To satisfy my superstitions #</i>

54:47.454 --> 54:48.787
<i># You see me runnin'... #</i>

54:50.690 --> 54:52.725
- I have to go to the bathroom.

54:52.726 --> 54:54.326
- OK!

54:54.327 --> 54:57.296
<i># With superstitions #</i>

54:57.297 --> 54:58.530
- Whoa!

55:01.301 --> 55:03.102
<i># Need contradictions #</i>

55:05.972 --> 55:07.840
<i># For my superstitions #</i>

55:07.841 --> 55:09.241
- Hello.

55:09.242 --> 55:11.510
- It's me.

55:11.511 --> 55:13.645
- Hi.

55:13.646 --> 55:16.148
- Come to the restaurant
near the park.

55:16.149 --> 55:17.616
<i>Now.</i>

55:17.617 --> 55:19.284
- Uh, why?

55:19.285 --> 55:21.453
- 'Cause there's someone
I want you to meet.

55:22.489 --> 55:23.789
- Who?

55:23.790 --> 55:25.657
- A guy.

55:27.394 --> 55:29.261
- I can't.

55:29.262 --> 55:30.763
- Why not?

55:31.798 --> 55:34.833
- I am out with a girl.

55:34.834 --> 55:36.802
- No, you're not.

55:36.803 --> 55:38.470
- Yeah, I am.

55:38.471 --> 55:40.005
- Are you on your way?

55:40.006 --> 55:41.907
- No, I'm not coming!

56:10.570 --> 56:13.038
Nice penis. Gotta go!

56:16.042 --> 56:18.977
- That was really, really nice.

56:18.978 --> 56:21.647
- You should've called me.
Why didn't you call me?

56:21.648 --> 56:23.415
- I know,
I shouldn't be drinking.

56:23.416 --> 56:24.750
- I told you!

56:26.586 --> 56:27.619
- Hello?

56:27.620 --> 56:28.854
- Hi!

56:30.256 --> 56:32.191
I'm Jean-Jacques.

56:33.593 --> 56:34.693
It's nice to meet you.

56:34.694 --> 56:36.462
- Nice to meet you.

56:37.497 --> 56:39.331
- Please, have a seat.

56:44.704 --> 56:46.872
- Were you really
with a girl?

56:48.675 --> 56:51.410
- No, I was with a guy.

56:53.246 --> 56:54.980
- I knew it.

56:54.981 --> 56:59.351
- Well, uh, Charlie,
I've heard a lot about you.

56:59.352 --> 57:00.886
- Have you?

57:02.722 --> 57:05.324
- I understand you're
a good friend of Jordan's.

57:10.830 --> 57:12.197
- That's right.

57:15.135 --> 57:17.036
- Would you excuse me, please?

57:45.265 --> 57:46.999
- Where's Charlie?

57:47.000 --> 57:48.834
- He left.

57:48.835 --> 57:51.403
He said he had to study.

57:51.404 --> 57:53.105
- Oh.

57:53.106 --> 57:56.675
- You were right.
I liked him very much.

57:58.111 --> 58:01.380
In fact, he gave me 10 rules
to follow in our relationship,

58:02.682 --> 58:06.385
which I thought was
a little odd, but generous.

58:07.387 --> 58:08.954
- What were they?

58:08.955 --> 58:10.689
- Let's see.

58:12.359 --> 58:14.793
First, don't let her drink.

58:14.794 --> 58:17.896
When she does,
use the fireman's carry.

58:20.266 --> 58:22.501
Be prepared to go to jail.

58:24.137 --> 58:26.905
<i>- Don't expect
a lot of help from her dad.</i>

58:28.508 --> 58:31.810
Whatever you think
is gonna happen next,

58:31.811 --> 58:33.612
you're wrong.

58:36.149 --> 58:38.917
If her feet hurt,
exchange shoes with her.

58:40.186 --> 58:42.588
<i>Learn to say
the following phrase</i>

58:42.589 --> 58:45.624
over and over to yourself:

58:45.625 --> 58:48.560
It's all part of the charm.

58:53.099 --> 58:58.037
On your 33rd day together,
bring her a single rose.

58:58.038 --> 59:01.273
Give it to her
in her recital class.

59:06.846 --> 59:10.349
If she says she's
gonna kill you,

59:10.350 --> 59:13.318
don't assume
it's a metaphor.

59:16.389 --> 59:20.359
<i>She likes to write.
Encourage her.</i>

59:20.360 --> 59:23.662
<i>And finally,
your time with her</i>

59:23.663 --> 59:27.566
<i>will be the happiest
you've been in your life.</i>

59:29.736 --> 59:32.237
Enjoy every second.

59:39.579 --> 59:41.313
- Hey, watch out!

59:56.963 --> 59:58.530
- Charlie.

01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:09.641
Wake up!

01:00:09.642 --> 01:00:11.310
Hey, wake up!

01:00:11.311 --> 01:00:12.678
- What?

01:00:14.447 --> 01:00:18.150
<i>Attention passengers on...
downtown platform.</i>

01:00:18.151 --> 01:00:20.219
<i>- What kind of diction
is that?</i>

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.887
How could anyone
understand you?

01:00:21.888 --> 01:00:24.123
- Should I make the
announcement at all?

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:26.058
Because I could
easily forget the whole--

01:00:26.059 --> 01:00:27.259
- I would rather,

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:30.162
if you're gonna do
something nice for someone,

01:00:30.163 --> 01:00:32.731
that you did it
properly and well.

01:00:32.732 --> 01:00:35.334
<i>- This PA system is
50 years old!</i>

01:00:35.335 --> 01:00:38.070
If the queen of England made
the announcement

01:00:38.071 --> 01:00:39.738
you wouldn't understand it!

01:00:39.739 --> 01:00:42.274
- The queen wouldn't step foot
in this shithole!

01:00:44.077 --> 01:00:46.578
<i>- I'll tell you what.
You make the announcement.</i>

01:00:46.579 --> 01:00:48.447
We'll see if
you can do any better.

01:00:48.448 --> 01:00:50.749
- Well, it couldn't
be any worse, right?

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.818
Let's see.

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:54.486
- Charlie? I'm sorry.

01:00:54.487 --> 01:00:57.356
<i>He's just a guy my father
made me go out with.</i>

01:00:57.357 --> 01:00:58.424
- Sorry!

01:00:58.425 --> 01:01:00.359
<i>- Every second
I was with him,</i>

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.994
I was wishing it was you,

01:01:01.995 --> 01:01:03.796
<i>and that's why
I called you tonight.</i>

01:01:03.797 --> 01:01:05.164
I couldn't take it anymore.

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:06.498
- That's him!

01:01:06.499 --> 01:01:08.300
<i>- Charlie, I need you.</i>

01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:11.403
Please, come to the
station master's office, OK?

01:01:12.405 --> 01:01:14.973
She's this rat-faced
woman, all right?

01:01:14.974 --> 01:01:16.475
But she'll let you in.

01:01:16.476 --> 01:01:19.211
OK? She's on the second floor.

01:01:19.212 --> 01:01:23.816
Charlie, please, just come
to the station master's office.

01:01:23.817 --> 01:01:25.718
I'm sorry.
Just don't...

01:01:25.719 --> 01:01:27.486
Don't leave me.

01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:30.389
Charlie!

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.257
<i>- Charlie!
Praise Jesus!</i>

01:01:34.627 --> 01:01:36.028
All right?

01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:37.830
You can go now.

01:01:43.703 --> 01:01:45.871
Wait! Who said
you could hug me?

01:01:46.906 --> 01:01:48.507
- Nobody!

01:01:48.508 --> 01:01:50.776
- I like the way
you handle me. Come on!

01:01:54.748 --> 01:01:57.850
<i>- That night, all she wanted
to do was dance.</i>

01:01:57.851 --> 01:02:01.387
<i># You and I #</i>

01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:04.723
<i># Alone in the night #</i>

01:02:05.959 --> 01:02:08.861
<i># Dancing to the rhythm #</i>

01:02:08.862 --> 01:02:11.997
<i># Of a love shining so bright #</i>

01:02:13.733 --> 01:02:18.003
<i># I can't take my eyes off you #</i>

01:02:18.004 --> 01:02:21.073
<i># Tell me darling
if it's true #</i>

01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:25.044
<i># The skies smile
from high above #</i>

01:02:25.045 --> 01:02:28.013
<i># I'm in love #</i>

01:02:28.014 --> 01:02:30.849
<i># Takin' a chance #</i>

01:02:32.452 --> 01:02:36.689
<i># That this
restless summer night #</i>

01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:38.457
<i># Gave us a fine romance #</i>

01:02:38.458 --> 01:02:39.558
- Whoa!

01:02:41.461 --> 01:02:43.095
<i># When you're near me #</i>

01:02:43.096 --> 01:02:47.032
<i># I fall like
an evanescent star #</i>

01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:50.769
<i># Smiling from high above #</i>

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:54.473
<i># I'm in love #</i>

01:02:54.474 --> 01:02:57.376
<i>- But unfortunately she
drank too much and passed out.</i>

01:02:57.377 --> 01:03:00.212
<i># I'm in love #</i>

01:03:02.415 --> 01:03:05.284
<i># I'm in love #</i>

01:03:16.563 --> 01:03:18.063
Sir...

01:03:18.064 --> 01:03:22.468
Would you mind, uh, taking
the long way through the park?

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:34.813
- Hey, Charlie!

01:03:34.814 --> 01:03:35.948
How's it goin'?

01:03:35.949 --> 01:03:37.649
- Good, Jimmy!
Thank you.

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:40.686
- OK. Oh!
Oh, here we go.

01:03:40.687 --> 01:03:42.154
- She's-- she's--

01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:43.389
- OK!

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:44.423
- OK.

01:03:44.424 --> 01:03:45.691
- Hello, Miss Roark.

01:03:46.693 --> 01:03:48.460
How you doin'?
- Good.

01:03:50.296 --> 01:03:51.764
- Thank you.

01:03:51.765 --> 01:03:53.699
- Yep! See you
next Thursday!

01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:03.042
<i>- Hello.</i>

01:04:03.043 --> 01:04:05.077
- Are you thinking about me?

01:04:06.212 --> 01:04:08.547
<i>- Yeah, um,
are you feeling beter?</i>

01:04:08.548 --> 01:04:10.315
- Yes.

01:04:11.518 --> 01:04:12.918
- What are you
laughing at?

01:04:12.919 --> 01:04:15.654
- Write me a letter telling
me how you feel about me.

01:04:15.655 --> 01:04:18.657
In truthful prose that is
deeply moving and not baroque.

01:04:18.658 --> 01:04:20.526
Don't overwrite.
I cannot bear that.

01:04:20.527 --> 01:04:21.527
- OK.

01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:23.228
- I'm gonna write
a letter to you

01:04:23.229 --> 01:04:24.930
telling you how
I feel about you.

01:04:24.931 --> 01:04:25.931
- Are you?

01:04:25.932 --> 01:04:27.199
- Mm-hmm. And believe me,

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.635
my letter is going to be
extremely well-written.

01:04:29.636 --> 01:04:30.636
- I'm sure.

01:04:30.637 --> 01:04:32.204
- So work hard on your letter.

01:04:32.205 --> 01:04:35.174
Otherwise you're gonna be
embarrassed by the comparison.

01:04:35.175 --> 01:04:36.175
- I will!

01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:37.776
- Bring it to Central Park.

01:04:37.777 --> 01:04:40.579
I'll meet you at the
promenade at 2:00 o'clock.

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.114
- OK.

01:04:42.115 --> 01:04:43.916
- Write well.

01:04:43.917 --> 01:04:47.453
- Yeah, um, you too.

01:04:47.454 --> 01:04:49.421
- Oh, I will.

01:05:04.904 --> 01:05:07.006
- What?

01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:10.509
Do you suppose
someone could be heard

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:12.411
from all the way
at the other end?

01:05:12.412 --> 01:05:13.946
- Yeah!

01:05:13.947 --> 01:05:17.016
Well, no.
May--

01:05:17.017 --> 01:05:19.184
Maybe. Maybe.
It's very far.

01:05:19.185 --> 01:05:22.354
I think-- I think if you had one
person who was extremely loud

01:05:22.355 --> 01:05:24.189
and the other person
had good hearing.

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:25.190
- Go over there.

01:05:26.459 --> 01:05:29.928
I'll scream something from
here and answer if you hear me.

01:05:29.929 --> 01:05:33.132
- You want me to go
all the way down there?

01:05:33.133 --> 01:05:34.833
Just so you can...

01:05:34.834 --> 01:05:36.402
- Yeah.

01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:39.838
- All the way down
to the end?

01:05:39.839 --> 01:05:41.840
- Yes.

01:06:00.193 --> 01:06:02.094
Charlie!

01:06:02.095 --> 01:06:04.430
Can you hear me?

01:06:10.937 --> 01:06:13.405
Charlie, can you hear me?

01:06:17.677 --> 01:06:19.545
I'm sorry!

01:06:20.814 --> 01:06:23.349
I'm so sorry, I--

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:25.951
I can't help it.
I--

01:06:25.952 --> 01:06:28.287
I can't help it!

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:32.558
I thought I was different!

01:06:34.394 --> 01:06:37.096
I thought I was stronger,
but I'm not.

01:07:01.888 --> 01:07:04.456
- Why do we have
a cocktail shaker?

01:07:08.995 --> 01:07:10.729
Were you crying before?

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:13.799
- It's a time capsule.
Give me your letter.

01:07:14.801 --> 01:07:15.968
- Why?

01:07:15.969 --> 01:07:18.103
- We're gonna put 'em
in here and bury them,

01:07:18.104 --> 01:07:19.471
and exactly a year from now,

01:07:19.472 --> 01:07:21.840
we're gonna come back
and we're gonna dig it up,

01:07:21.841 --> 01:07:24.576
read the letters, and maybe
then we'll have the answer.

01:07:24.577 --> 01:07:26.478
- What's the question?

01:07:26.479 --> 01:07:29.648
- The question is,
are we going to be together?

01:07:29.649 --> 01:07:32.284
- Well, I'm glad
that's the question.

01:07:32.285 --> 01:07:34.687
Why do we have to wait
a year to find out?

01:07:34.688 --> 01:07:37.022
- I explain it in my letter.

01:07:43.296 --> 01:07:45.898
- Which I have to wait a year
to read.

01:07:48.234 --> 01:07:51.670
A year is a long time.
A lot can happen.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.407
- Yeah.

01:08:06.486 --> 01:08:10.189
We'll meet back here,
under the tree,

01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:12.091
exactly a year from now.

01:08:15.929 --> 01:08:18.162
At 2:00 O'clock, OK?

01:08:25.404 --> 01:08:27.339
<i># I put a record on #</i>

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:28.340
- Good?

01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:29.341
- Yeah.

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:35.413
<i># Put it on and sing along
with you #</i>

01:08:36.783 --> 01:08:39.551
<i># Sing along with you #</i>

01:08:42.956 --> 01:08:44.923
Come on.

01:08:49.796 --> 01:08:53.399
<i># And that's OK by me #</i>

01:08:54.434 --> 01:08:56.167
<i># That's OK #</i>

01:08:56.169 --> 01:08:57.435
You take the first one.

01:08:57.437 --> 01:08:59.037
<i># Because in a way I'm free... #</i>

01:08:59.038 --> 01:09:00.339
- We could ride together.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.807
- No, I'll take the next one.

01:09:01.808 --> 01:09:04.576
If I don't say goodbye to you
now, I won't be able to.

01:09:04.577 --> 01:09:06.578
- Then don't.

01:09:06.578 --> 01:09:08.279
- I have to.

01:09:09.314 --> 01:09:10.482
- Why?

01:09:10.483 --> 01:09:12.551
- It's in the letter.

01:09:14.587 --> 01:09:16.788
<i># I will try #</i>

01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:17.823
- Right.

01:09:17.823 --> 01:09:20.959
<i># And dry my eyes #</i>

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.497
<i># And I'm OK
if we're drinkin' #</i>

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.236
<i># Grab a beer
and disappear with me #</i>

01:09:32.272 --> 01:09:34.740
<i># Disappear with me #</i>

01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:41.046
<i># And I put a record on #</i>

01:09:42.948 --> 01:09:47.953
<i># I put it on
and get it one with you #</i>

01:09:49.122 --> 01:09:51.290
<i># Get it on with you #</i>

01:09:52.325 --> 01:09:53.759
- Jordan?

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.728
- Charlie!

01:09:55.729 --> 01:09:57.629
<i># This time #</i>

01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:58.697
Charlie?

01:09:58.698 --> 01:09:59.698
<i># You'll find #</i>

01:09:59.699 --> 01:10:00.966
Where are you?
Charlie!

01:10:00.967 --> 01:10:03.435
<i># Some other
gonna mess your mind #</i>

01:10:03.436 --> 01:10:06.338
<i># It's too late or too soon #</i>

01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:12.511
<i># Some other gonna come #</i>

01:10:13.546 --> 01:10:17.750
<i># Come too soon #</i>

01:10:18.752 --> 01:10:20.919
<i># Put it on #</i>

01:10:22.422 --> 01:10:26.225
<i># I will try and dry my eyes #</i>

01:10:26.226 --> 01:10:27.960
<i># Put it on #</i>

01:10:32.832 --> 01:10:35.668
- I knew what she'd be thinking.

01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:38.270
We were meant to be separated.

01:10:41.207 --> 01:10:43.976
So that's how we broke up.

01:10:48.348 --> 01:10:50.983
<i>Among my goals
for the next year,</i>

01:10:50.984 --> 01:10:54.119
were to improve myself for
when we got back together.

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.588
It wasn't gonna be easy.

01:10:56.589 --> 01:11:01.226
<i>I had what you call
"poor hand-eye coordination",</i>

01:11:02.996 --> 01:11:04.897
and no natural buoyancy.

01:11:06.366 --> 01:11:08.100
Oh!

01:11:08.101 --> 01:11:11.170
But what I lacked in ability,
I made up for in determination.

01:11:11.171 --> 01:11:14.306
<i>Within 6 months,
I was beating Mr. Snapperstein.</i>

01:11:15.308 --> 01:11:16.475
- Oy!

01:11:16.476 --> 01:11:19.111
<i>- I could swim the crawl.</i>

01:11:20.714 --> 01:11:23.248
<i>And, my kendo instructor
stopped calling me</i>

01:11:23.249 --> 01:11:24.917
"He Who Dies Repeatedly".

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.055
I filed a Hail Mary application
with the Tiller King people.

01:11:30.056 --> 01:11:32.091
<i>But I didn't hold out
a lot of hope.</i>

01:11:32.092 --> 01:11:35.160
<i>As a backup,
I took Estate Planning,</i>

01:11:35.161 --> 01:11:39.765
<i>which was only slightly
less boring than actually dying.</i>

01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:45.137
<i>Leo met new
and interesting people.</i>

01:11:45.138 --> 01:11:47.873
Um, this was before anyone peed.

01:11:49.175 --> 01:11:53.345
<i>My feelings for Jordan
didn't diminish at all.</i>

01:11:53.346 --> 01:11:55.814
But then, I didn't want them to.

01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:58.450
- Oh!
- Whoa!

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:02.855
- You have to go out
with other people.

01:12:02.856 --> 01:12:05.257
You can't just sit
around waiting for a year.

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:09.361
- Because it's unwatchable!

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.531
- Jordan.

01:12:13.933 --> 01:12:15.701
- Why not?

01:12:15.702 --> 01:12:19.438
- Because what would
be the point?

01:12:22.142 --> 01:12:24.410
- Twelve.

01:12:24.411 --> 01:12:26.845
Just go out with
12 regular girls,

01:12:26.846 --> 01:12:28.781
as a personal favour to me.

01:12:29.783 --> 01:12:31.817
- Eight.
- Ten

01:12:32.819 --> 01:12:34.887
- Ten.

01:12:34.888 --> 01:12:36.922
- I mean, I wouldn't mind...

01:12:36.923 --> 01:12:40.859
<i># She won't stop
to teach them all... #</i>

01:12:42.328 --> 01:12:45.164
- Sort of like an MBA
in the mind, huh?

01:12:45.165 --> 01:12:46.465
- Yeah.

01:12:46.466 --> 01:12:47.866
- Um, um, uh...

01:12:47.867 --> 01:12:50.903
- If you knew that, you wouldn't
have done that. Or would you?

01:12:50.904 --> 01:12:52.171
- Um...
- I'm sorry!

01:12:52.172 --> 01:12:53.872
- I, uh, OK.

01:12:55.308 --> 01:12:57.309
- C-H-E-R-R-I-S
- Tremendously...

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.282
- Yeah, I don't think
this is gonna work.

01:13:03.283 --> 01:13:06.819
<i>- Anyway, it made
the time go by faster.</i>

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.787
Finally, the day came.

01:13:08.788 --> 01:13:12.324
I-- I was a little nervous.
A little bit, you know.

01:13:12.325 --> 01:13:14.893
Slightly on edge.

01:13:14.894 --> 01:13:16.962
- Want me to go with you?

01:13:18.098 --> 01:13:20.065
- Why would I--

01:13:21.601 --> 01:13:23.769
Why would I possibly?

01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:25.337
- OK.

01:13:26.573 --> 01:13:28.474
- But thank you.

01:13:29.909 --> 01:13:31.176
- That's the bathroom.

01:13:31.177 --> 01:13:32.411
- I know!

01:13:58.938 --> 01:14:00.973
<i>I was, of course, early</i>

01:14:00.974 --> 01:14:03.575
and she was, of course, late.

01:14:12.485 --> 01:14:16.422
<i>I didn't start to worry
until 2:30, 2:45.</i>

01:14:16.423 --> 01:14:20.626
Uh, by 3:00 I still wanted
to wait just a little longer,

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:23.896
<i>but by 4:00,
I had to face facts.</i>

01:14:23.897 --> 01:14:26.031
<i>She wasn't coming.</i>

01:14:27.267 --> 01:14:29.768
<i>And there was
only one thing to do.</i>

01:14:58.298 --> 01:15:03.535
<i>- Dear Charlie.
Hi. How was your year?</i>

01:15:03.536 --> 01:15:06.638
<i>Charlie, I have some things
to tell you.</i>

01:15:06.639 --> 01:15:07.873
<i>When we first met,</i>

01:15:07.874 --> 01:15:10.309
<i>I said that my fiancée
had broken up with me.</i>

01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:11.910
<i>That was a lie.</i>

01:15:11.911 --> 01:15:14.580
Truth is he passed away.

01:15:14.581 --> 01:15:18.150
<i>All he said in his note
was that he was sorry,</i>

01:15:18.151 --> 01:15:20.686
<i>but that there was
too much pain.</i>

01:15:25.892 --> 01:15:28.460
<i>I was devastated.
I couldn't accept it.</i>

01:15:28.461 --> 01:15:29.762
You know, I began to drink,

01:15:29.763 --> 01:15:32.064
<i>which, as you've seen,
I'm not very good at.</i>

01:15:32.065 --> 01:15:36.001
Oh, and I was frequently brought
home by strangers in taxi cabs,

01:15:37.003 --> 01:15:38.303
and that's why my father

01:15:38.304 --> 01:15:40.172
<i>acted the way
he did towards you.</i>

01:15:40.173 --> 01:15:43.876
Honestly, if you ever get to
know him, he's a very nice man.

01:15:45.812 --> 01:15:48.681
<i>I was very close
to my fiancée's mother.</i>

01:15:48.682 --> 01:15:52.317
<i>I tried to go see her
a little while after he died.</i>

01:15:52.318 --> 01:15:56.588
She said she had a great guy
she wanted to introduce me to.

01:15:56.589 --> 01:15:58.991
<i>I couldn't bear
the thought of it.</i>

01:16:00.393 --> 01:16:01.794
<i>And then I met you.</i>

01:16:02.829 --> 01:16:05.230
You reminded me of him.

01:16:05.231 --> 01:16:07.800
You were both strong and kind

01:16:07.801 --> 01:16:10.703
and confident...
in your own way.

01:16:10.704 --> 01:16:12.938
Charles Bellow.

01:16:15.809 --> 01:16:17.309
- Charlie.

01:16:19.312 --> 01:16:21.847
<i>- Hmm. You even look like him.</i>

01:16:21.848 --> 01:16:24.116
<i>And there were
many other parallels.</i>

01:16:24.117 --> 01:16:27.753
<i>They were small,
but they seemed important.</i>

01:16:29.356 --> 01:16:32.057
<i>He and I met
on a subway platform.</i>

01:16:32.058 --> 01:16:33.726
<i>Just as you and I met.</i>

01:16:36.329 --> 01:16:38.997
<i>Like you, he carried
a handkerchief.</i>

01:16:40.934 --> 01:16:44.370
I was very sick at the time
and he took care of me...

01:16:45.705 --> 01:16:47.439
<i>like you did.</i>

01:16:53.213 --> 01:16:55.781
<i>As you and I
got to know each other,</i>

01:16:55.782 --> 01:16:58.617
<i>I felt the cloud begin
to lift a little bit.</i>

01:16:58.618 --> 01:17:00.152
I thought this was because

01:17:00.153 --> 01:17:03.088
<i>of the similarities
between you and him.</i>

01:17:04.524 --> 01:17:06.225
<i>And so I decided
that you and I</i>

01:17:06.226 --> 01:17:08.560
<i>would do everything
he and I had done.</i>

01:17:08.561 --> 01:17:11.964
<i>That way, it would be almost
like he had never died</i>

01:17:11.965 --> 01:17:13.565
and the pain would stop.

01:17:17.504 --> 01:17:19.672
<i>Because on
our 33rd day together,</i>

01:17:19.673 --> 01:17:21.573
he brought a rose to my class,

01:17:21.574 --> 01:17:23.942
I asked you to do the same.

01:17:26.946 --> 01:17:30.582
Because he and I planned
our future under this tree,

01:17:30.583 --> 01:17:33.252
<i>I chose it
for you and me as well.</i>

01:17:38.858 --> 01:17:41.160
<i>Because he and I had
a favourite restaurant...</i>

01:17:41.161 --> 01:17:42.161
Cheers!

01:17:42.162 --> 01:17:43.929
<i>I brought you there.</i>

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:47.032
<i>And because he died
in the ocean...</i>

01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:49.535
I pushed you to go in...

01:17:50.837 --> 01:17:52.438
<i>and then saved you.</i>

01:17:52.439 --> 01:17:54.540
<i>All of this was crazy</i>

01:17:54.541 --> 01:17:57.910
and selfish and wrong, I know.

01:17:57.911 --> 01:18:00.312
But grief can make us crazy.

01:18:01.314 --> 01:18:02.948
Anyway, it didn't work

01:18:02.949 --> 01:18:04.350
<i>And at a certain point,</i>

01:18:04.351 --> 01:18:07.619
I realized I didn't like you
because you were like him.

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:08.887
- Whoa!

01:18:08.888 --> 01:18:11.357
<i>- I liked you
because I liked you.</i>

01:18:11.358 --> 01:18:13.625
<i>But every time
I started to be happy,</i>

01:18:13.626 --> 01:18:15.527
<i>I would stop myself.</i>

01:18:15.528 --> 01:18:17.996
It felt wrong to be happy.

01:18:17.997 --> 01:18:21.667
It felt wrong to let go,
to just forget about him,

01:18:21.668 --> 01:18:23.435
<i>even for just a minute.</i>

01:18:23.436 --> 01:18:25.671
<i>It felt like
I was betraying him.</i>

01:18:26.706 --> 01:18:28.607
All I could do was hurt you

01:18:28.608 --> 01:18:30.476
and that's not me, Charlie.

01:18:30.477 --> 01:18:32.378
<i>That's not me at all.</i>

01:18:32.379 --> 01:18:35.547
<i>And someday,
I hope I can show you as much.</i>

01:18:41.021 --> 01:18:43.022
Something had to be done.

01:18:43.023 --> 01:18:45.691
<i>In order for us to have
a chance in the future,</i>

01:18:45.692 --> 01:18:47.993
<i>I had to make a break
with the past.</i>

01:18:49.195 --> 01:18:51.363
<i>And for this,
I needed time.</i>

01:18:55.235 --> 01:18:57.970
I hope I've healed during
our year apart.

01:18:57.971 --> 01:19:01.440
And that I'm sitting with you
while you read this.

01:19:08.314 --> 01:19:11.684
But if I'm not...

01:19:11.685 --> 01:19:14.520
It's not because
I don't love you.

01:19:14.521 --> 01:19:16.855
Because I do.

01:19:18.358 --> 01:19:21.260
And it's not because
I don't miss you.

01:19:22.662 --> 01:19:24.997
Because I miss you already.

01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:30.002
It'll just mean
that I'm not better.

01:19:31.905 --> 01:19:34.306
And that the story
isn't over yet.

01:19:40.613 --> 01:19:43.682
<i>Will you wait for me, Charlie?
Can you wait?</i>

01:19:43.683 --> 01:19:46.318
<i>With all my heart,
I hope you can.</i>

01:19:46.319 --> 01:19:48.287
<i>Love, Jordan.</i>

01:20:11.878 --> 01:20:14.446
- Sir, is everything OK?

01:20:15.915 --> 01:20:17.249
- Yes.

01:20:18.752 --> 01:20:21.420
Oh, yes.

01:20:21.421 --> 01:20:23.689
Forgive me for staring.

01:20:23.690 --> 01:20:27.092
When I was younger, I would've
tried to be more discreet.

01:20:27.093 --> 01:20:30.229
But at my age,
I don't pretend anymore.

01:20:30.230 --> 01:20:31.263
What's the point?

01:20:31.264 --> 01:20:32.865
- I understand.

01:20:34.567 --> 01:20:37.002
- So it's OK
with you if I stare?

01:20:37.003 --> 01:20:39.471
- Stare away if you'd like.

01:20:41.107 --> 01:20:43.976
- That's great.
Thank you, thank you.

01:20:43.977 --> 01:20:45.711
- Is this your tree?

01:20:45.712 --> 01:20:47.279
Yes.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:50.449
Well, not exactly,

01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:54.620
but this tree
and I have a secret.

01:20:54.621 --> 01:20:56.388
- You do!

01:20:56.389 --> 01:20:58.824
So do this tree and I.

01:21:01.094 --> 01:21:02.795
- Is this your rock pile?

01:21:04.297 --> 01:21:05.631
- Yes.

01:21:05.632 --> 01:21:07.599
- What does it mark?

01:21:10.403 --> 01:21:12.638
- Well...

01:21:12.639 --> 01:21:15.307
A year and a day ago,
my boyfriend and I,

01:21:15.308 --> 01:21:16.742
we buried letters here.

01:21:16.743 --> 01:21:20.012
We promised to meet back
a year later to read them,

01:21:20.013 --> 01:21:21.980
but I didn't show up yesterday.

01:21:21.981 --> 01:21:23.716
- I see.

01:21:23.717 --> 01:21:25.851
- What's your secret?

01:21:27.387 --> 01:21:29.788
- Tell me, have
you been back here

01:21:29.789 --> 01:21:31.724
since you buried
the letters?

01:21:31.725 --> 01:21:33.425
- No.

01:21:33.426 --> 01:21:36.228
- Do you know what's
happened in the meantime?

01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:37.830
- No.

01:21:37.831 --> 01:21:40.332
- Look closely at the tree.

01:21:40.333 --> 01:21:43.168
Does it look as
you remembered it?

01:21:44.604 --> 01:21:48.941
- Oh, uh, at first I thought so,
but now I'm not so sure!

01:21:48.942 --> 01:21:51.810
<i>- Four months ago,
the tree that was standing here</i>

01:21:51.811 --> 01:21:54.013
<i>was struck and killed
by lightening.</i>

01:21:54.014 --> 01:21:57.116
The young man who replaced
the tree comes here quite a lot.

01:21:58.118 --> 01:21:59.785
We've spoken once or twice.

01:21:59.786 --> 01:22:01.920
- You can traumatize
the roots. I read it.

01:22:01.921 --> 01:22:04.356
- What are you,
Martha Stewart?

01:22:04.357 --> 01:22:06.792
<i>- He tells me
it's very important</i>

01:22:06.793 --> 01:22:08.427
that there be a tree here.

01:22:09.729 --> 01:22:12.231
Do you suppose he's the one

01:22:12.232 --> 01:22:15.334
<i>with whom you buried
the letters?</i>

01:22:17.237 --> 01:22:19.271
- Yeah.

01:22:19.272 --> 01:22:20.806
- He's very nice.

01:22:20.807 --> 01:22:23.142
Very strong in his way.

01:22:24.644 --> 01:22:26.645
- Yeah, he is.

01:22:26.646 --> 01:22:29.381
- Now, does the fact
that you've come here today

01:22:29.382 --> 01:22:30.749
mean that you're healed?

01:22:32.018 --> 01:22:34.720
Yeah, I read your letters.

01:22:34.721 --> 01:22:37.389
I'm sorry.
It's very wrong of me,

01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:41.794
but it gets very boring just
coming, sitting here sketching.

01:22:41.795 --> 01:22:43.629
Besides, I told you,

01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:46.265
old people just do
what they want.

01:22:47.701 --> 01:22:49.335
- It's OK.

01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:54.473
- So... are you ready
to be with him now?

01:22:54.474 --> 01:22:57.443
- Well, I wouldn't have
come if I wasn't ready.

01:22:57.444 --> 01:22:58.844
- Great.

01:22:58.845 --> 01:23:00.913
That's wonderful.

01:23:00.914 --> 01:23:04.016
Come on, I want you to
read the letter and call him.

01:23:04.017 --> 01:23:05.084
I'll help you dig.

01:23:05.085 --> 01:23:06.085
- Uh...

01:23:06.086 --> 01:23:07.119
- What?

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.854
- Well, I'll read his letter,

01:23:08.855 --> 01:23:10.456
but I'm not gonna call him.

01:23:10.457 --> 01:23:13.525
- What are you nuts?
After all you've been through?

01:23:13.526 --> 01:23:14.693
- If it was meant to be,

01:23:14.694 --> 01:23:16.428
I would've been healed
by yesterday.

01:23:16.429 --> 01:23:19.698
- What kind of nonsense is that?
Yesterday was one day ago.

01:23:19.699 --> 01:23:21.467
Your healing was
off by one day?

01:23:21.468 --> 01:23:24.236
- One very important day.

01:23:25.372 --> 01:23:27.172
Destiny has spoken.

01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:29.908
And to search for him,

01:23:29.909 --> 01:23:32.778
would be like trying to
shape and mould destiny

01:23:32.779 --> 01:23:34.947
and that just can't
be a good idea.

01:23:36.483 --> 01:23:41.153
- Just suppose that the
shaping and moulding of destiny

01:23:41.154 --> 01:23:43.822
is in fact your destiny.

01:23:46.326 --> 01:23:49.862
- Ha! I never thought
about it like that.

01:23:49.863 --> 01:23:53.632
- I'll tell you what destiny
means if you really wanna know.

01:23:53.633 --> 01:23:56.669
That's the least I can do
for you letting me stare.

01:23:59.673 --> 01:24:01.006
- What does it mean?

01:24:02.909 --> 01:24:05.811
- Destiny is the bridge
you build

01:24:05.812 --> 01:24:08.147
to the one you love.

01:24:11.551 --> 01:24:14.720
- Yeah, but if it's meant to be,
it's meant to be, right?

01:24:14.721 --> 01:24:16.689
- Aw!

01:24:16.690 --> 01:24:19.658
I've been hearing people
say that to me for 78 years,

01:24:19.659 --> 01:24:22.227
and I gotta tell you,
it really pisses me off!

01:24:22.228 --> 01:24:25.130
OK, I'll leave you
to your letter.

01:24:25.131 --> 01:24:28.167
It's not polite
for me to stay.

01:24:28.168 --> 01:24:30.769
Besides, you're going to cry.

01:24:32.372 --> 01:24:33.739
It's very moving.

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:36.675
He must've written
many drafts.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:43.248
I wish you a story
with a happy ending...

01:24:45.585 --> 01:24:49.054
and the wisdom to look for it.

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:52.391
- Thank you.

01:24:57.597 --> 01:24:59.198
<i>- I got the job.</i>

01:24:59.199 --> 01:25:01.867
<i>- That's fantastic, Charlie!
- That's unbelievable!</i>

01:25:01.868 --> 01:25:04.136
- Yeah, you have no idea.

01:25:04.137 --> 01:25:05.771
Um, here's the thing.

01:25:05.772 --> 01:25:07.639
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh?

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.775
- I don't wanna work for
Tiller King.

01:25:09.776 --> 01:25:11.744
- Why not?

01:25:11.745 --> 01:25:14.079
- I--I'm sorry.
I ju-- I don't.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.280
- Well, wha--

01:25:15.281 --> 01:25:17.516
What are you
gonna do then?

01:25:19.152 --> 01:25:21.286
- I'm gonna live.

01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:42.608
<i>Dear Jordan,</i>

01:25:42.609 --> 01:25:43.942
<i>This is the story</i>

01:25:43.943 --> 01:25:46.412
<i>of the first and last time
I ever fell in love.</i>

01:25:46.413 --> 01:25:50.649
<i>And of the beautiful,
complicated, fascinating woman</i>

01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:54.319
<i>who inhabits my soul.</i>

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.889
<i>I'm pretty sure
you're gonna leave me tomorrow,</i>

01:25:56.890 --> 01:26:00.125
<i>so I better say this
while I have the chance.</i>

01:26:05.432 --> 01:26:08.634
Whether we're together or apart,

01:26:08.635 --> 01:26:12.771
<i>You will always be
the woman of my life.</i>

01:26:14.307 --> 01:26:18.777
The only man I will ever envy
is the man who wins your heart,

01:26:18.778 --> 01:26:22.781
and I will always believe it was
my destiny to be that man.

01:26:24.918 --> 01:26:27.052
<i>If we never
see each other again,</i>

01:26:27.053 --> 01:26:28.987
and you're out walking one day

01:26:28.988 --> 01:26:32.891
<i>and you feel
a certain presence beside you...</i>

01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:52.745
<i>that will be me...</i>

01:26:52.746 --> 01:26:56.181
<i>loving you...</i>

01:26:56.182 --> 01:26:58.384
<i>wherever I am.</i>

01:27:03.023 --> 01:27:05.991
- I mean, should I
just forget about her?

01:27:05.992 --> 01:27:07.860
I should forget about her.

01:27:07.861 --> 01:27:10.729
Because, realistically,
it's-- I mean...

01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:14.199
Realistically, could we
ever really be together

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:16.101
is the question, you know?

01:27:16.102 --> 01:27:20.105
And where is the line between
romantic and delusional?

01:27:20.106 --> 01:27:21.807
And how--how do you know

01:27:21.808 --> 01:27:24.643
once you've crossed
said line, you know?

01:27:24.644 --> 01:27:29.682
Do we live in the physical
world that we can touch,

01:27:29.683 --> 01:27:34.420
or do we live in the world
we create in our minds?

01:27:40.460 --> 01:27:42.561
You should be a business major.

01:27:52.405 --> 01:27:55.107
Excuse me, I said sparkling.

01:27:55.108 --> 01:27:57.643
- Oh, there she is!

01:28:02.582 --> 01:28:04.850
Oh, you've gotten
even more beautiful.

01:28:04.851 --> 01:28:06.452
- Oh, please!

01:28:06.453 --> 01:28:08.253
You've not aged a day!

01:28:08.254 --> 01:28:09.822
- Oh!

01:28:11.658 --> 01:28:14.093
So, how are you?

01:28:14.094 --> 01:28:15.861
- I'm good.

01:28:22.102 --> 01:28:24.003
Yeah.

01:28:24.004 --> 01:28:26.438
- Somewhere in heaven,
my son is sad.

01:28:26.439 --> 01:28:28.474
- No. No, no, no.
He's not.

01:28:29.509 --> 01:28:31.610
- Oh.

01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:33.712
No, you're right.

01:28:35.215 --> 01:28:36.915
He's happy for you.

01:28:40.587 --> 01:28:42.721
I'm happy for you.

01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:45.791
- Thank you.

01:28:52.198 --> 01:28:55.067
- So, shall I tell
you about this boy?

01:28:55.068 --> 01:28:56.301
- Oh--

01:28:56.302 --> 01:28:58.404
- He's the one I wanted
to introduce you to

01:28:58.405 --> 01:29:00.973
a year and a half ago,
but neither of you showed up.

01:29:00.974 --> 01:29:02.408
He's a business student.

01:29:02.409 --> 01:29:03.742
- Aunt Sally!

01:29:03.743 --> 01:29:05.844
- He's very, very smart.

01:29:05.845 --> 01:29:07.813
So handsome.

01:29:17.290 --> 01:29:19.224
Jordan.

01:29:19.225 --> 01:29:21.093
This is Charlie.

01:29:22.796 --> 01:29:24.430
- Oh...

01:29:39.879 --> 01:29:41.847
- I'm-- I'm sorry.
Am I--

01:29:41.848 --> 01:29:43.982
Do you two know each other?

01:29:43.983 --> 01:29:46.085
<i>- And that's how
the story ended.</i>

01:29:46.086 --> 01:29:48.053
Or, in a sense, how it began.

01:29:48.054 --> 01:29:51.123
- I told you I'd meet a man
from the future.

01:29:51.124 --> 01:29:52.958
<i>- Not bad, huh?</i>

01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.855
<i>And as for the question
of destiny,</i>

01:30:22.856 --> 01:30:26.592
all I know is that even
when destiny really wants

01:30:26.593 --> 01:30:28.460
to accomplish something,

01:30:28.461 --> 01:30:30.062
<i>it can't do it alone.</i>

01:30:30.063 --> 01:30:32.297
<i>You still have to go
to that restaurant.</i>

01:30:32.298 --> 01:30:34.400
You still have to show up.

01:30:34.401 --> 01:30:39.007
You still have to build a
bridge to the one you love.

01:30:46.746 --> 01:30:48.881
