♪♪

00:51.568 --> 00:55.138
Announcer: Ladies and
gentlemen, Forrest Shaw.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.742
All right.

01:02.743 --> 01:04.244
Okay.

01:04.245 --> 01:07.080
Settle down.

01:07.081 --> 01:09.048
That's enough. That's enough.

01:09.049 --> 01:10.550
I feel...

01:10.551 --> 01:12.311
I feel like that might not
have been sincere,

01:12.335 --> 01:13.786
but I appreciate it.

01:13.787 --> 01:17.153
For those that aren't
here, we're in Florida.

01:17.154 --> 01:18.655
We're literally...

01:18.656 --> 01:21.391
Literally hurricane Matthew
is hitting right now.

01:21.392 --> 01:24.529
We're shooting this special...

01:27.265 --> 01:29.866
- Man: All right, cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:29.867 --> 01:32.399
Everyone else in the country
is concerned.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.401
Everyone's that's texting me
from around the...

01:34.402 --> 01:36.122
"Are you guys...
Is it okay, the hurricane?"

01:36.146 --> 01:39.706
I'm like, "Yeah,
and we don't give a shit here."

01:39.707 --> 01:41.441
Right, that's...

01:41.442 --> 01:45.646
This is why people think Florida
is just a fucked up state.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.548
It is, but I mean,

01:47.549 --> 01:49.413
it's just a little bit
different here.

01:49.414 --> 01:51.315
You know, that's the...
It's the thing.

01:51.316 --> 01:55.486
And trust me, I defend Florida
wherever I go because I'm from here,

01:55.487 --> 01:57.655
and it's like the punchline
of the country.

01:57.656 --> 01:59.496
You know, did you see
what happened in Florida?

01:59.497 --> 02:00.831
Another guy
ate another guys face.

02:00.832 --> 02:03.928
Yeah, I know it happened again.

02:03.929 --> 02:05.393
I know crazy stuff happens here,

02:05.394 --> 02:07.274
but let's not act like
crazy shit doesn't happen

02:07.275 --> 02:08.508
everywhere in the country.

02:08.509 --> 02:10.031
When I first moved
to California,

02:10.032 --> 02:11.732
one of the first things I saw

02:11.733 --> 02:14.435
were two people
middle of the day having sex

02:14.436 --> 02:16.103
on a sidewalk at a bus stop

02:16.104 --> 02:18.940
while people just stepped over
out of the bus to get on 'em.

02:18.941 --> 02:22.307
There was like 25 people
with their phones filming it.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.209
Yeah, you know what? The next day I
didn't see that online anywhere.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.778
I didn't read it anywhere.

02:26.779 --> 02:29.099
I just have to assume in Florida
we have better journalists

02:29.123 --> 02:30.615
than the rest of the country.

02:30.616 --> 02:33.384
We're reporting on stories
people want to hear, right?

02:33.385 --> 02:35.385
Economy. Fuck that.
We don't wanna hear about that.

02:35.409 --> 02:37.722
We wanna hear about the guy
that hid cocaine in his ass.

02:37.723 --> 02:39.388
You know, that's...

02:43.492 --> 02:44.960
I know crazy shit happens here,

02:44.961 --> 02:47.963
but I just have to feel like
I have to defend it.

02:47.964 --> 02:52.167
One of my favorite stories is the guy
that got busted for child pornography

02:52.168 --> 02:54.069
and then he said,
Oh, I didn't do that.

02:54.070 --> 02:56.068
Ah, what happens is when
I'm away from home

02:56.069 --> 02:59.571
my cat walks on my keyboard.

02:59.572 --> 03:01.573
And then I came home
and there was...

03:01.574 --> 03:03.614
It sounds crazy, I know,
but I used to have a parrot

03:03.638 --> 03:05.143
that had and online
gambling problem.

03:05.144 --> 03:10.482
So I feel like that bird lost
me a lot of money right there.

03:10.483 --> 03:13.849
My favorite from story
from Florida though is, uh,

03:13.850 --> 03:16.385
there was a guy that almost got
his hand bit off by an alligator

03:16.386 --> 03:18.520
and so then he captured
the alligator

03:18.521 --> 03:20.389
and he wrapped it up
in duct tape

03:20.390 --> 03:22.758
and threw it in his bathtub
and then as revenge,

03:22.759 --> 03:26.595
repeatedly had sex with it.

03:26.596 --> 03:29.061
It was bad, yes, I know.
He's in jail so that's okay.

03:29.062 --> 03:31.030
But even worse, even worse

03:31.031 --> 03:33.899
is the alligator had to go back
to the swamp and you know,

03:33.900 --> 03:37.536
the other gators were asking
questions, right, like,

03:37.537 --> 03:40.017
"Hey man, where have you been?
We haven't seen you for awhile."

03:40.041 --> 03:42.174
He's like, "Why?
What've you heard?"

03:42.175 --> 03:44.243
It's not true
whatever you heard.

03:44.244 --> 03:46.644
I was visiting relatives on the
other side of the everglades.

03:46.668 --> 03:48.444
"That's where I was at."

03:48.445 --> 03:50.613
"Oh, 'cause we heard you got
deep dicked by a redneck.

03:50.614 --> 03:55.019
That's what blowing through
these here raids of sawgrass."

03:56.654 --> 03:59.656
I have a cat. She's really old.
She just turned 16.

03:59.657 --> 04:03.323
Um, had to take her to the vet.
I spent $800 on her.

04:03.324 --> 04:06.860
So she was about $200
away from dying.

04:06.861 --> 04:08.628
That's pretty really close.

04:08.629 --> 04:11.631
Yeah. That's all I had
on my credit card.

04:11.632 --> 04:14.232
I don't want to have that awkward
conversation at the vets office.

04:14.256 --> 04:15.402
You know.

04:15.403 --> 04:17.937
Sorry, Mr. Shaw, but your
pets life has been declined.

04:17.938 --> 04:19.935
Shit.

04:19.937 --> 04:22.739
Run it again. That's it though.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.975
Man, if you have a pet you know
you do that math though.

04:24.976 --> 04:26.777
You're sitting
at the vets office

04:26.778 --> 04:28.845
and you figure out how old they
are divided by how many times

04:28.846 --> 04:30.313
they took a shit on your pillow.

04:30.314 --> 04:32.482
You know, that's how much money
you spend on them.

04:32.483 --> 04:35.349
You know, you just want
for a moment for your animal

04:35.350 --> 04:37.351
to realize what the concept
of money is, you know,

04:37.352 --> 04:39.887
just come out for a second,
chest bump you like,

04:39.888 --> 04:41.388
"Thanks a lot. I appreciate...

04:41.389 --> 04:43.069
I'm gonna eat Ramen noodles
for two weeks."

04:43.093 --> 04:44.425
But that's not what my cat did.

04:44.426 --> 04:46.066
I took her home
and she pissed on a shirt.

04:46.090 --> 04:48.295
That's how she thanked me.

04:48.296 --> 04:50.016
You know, I don't know
a lot of you in here,

04:50.040 --> 04:51.498
but if I spent $800 on you,

04:51.499 --> 04:53.197
you'd at least tag me
in a Facebook pose,

04:53.198 --> 04:55.866
you know, a nice emoji text,

04:55.867 --> 05:00.237
thumbs up, kidney kidney,
appreciate the...

05:00.238 --> 05:02.106
So she's old,
I'm on the road a lot

05:02.107 --> 05:03.974
and I want to travel
with her now,

05:03.975 --> 05:06.310
so I just made her into
a service cat.

05:06.311 --> 05:09.644
Uh, yeah, she doesn't do
anything if you're wondering.

05:09.645 --> 05:13.181
She has no skillset. She has
the skillset of a dance mom.

05:13.182 --> 05:16.517
She just yells about shit a lot,
you know, like,

05:16.518 --> 05:18.886
"Hurry up, scoop my litter box.
Gotta get to jazz tap."

05:18.887 --> 05:20.321
Something like that I imagine.

05:20.322 --> 05:22.190
If you crack a door open
a little bit,

05:22.191 --> 05:23.831
she can get her paw in there
and then just

05:23.855 --> 05:25.757
wedge her head in there
and just, gah, gah, gah,

05:25.758 --> 05:28.860
service cat, get her a vest.

05:28.861 --> 05:32.397
Shouldn't have to do anything 'cause
I'm sure you're aware of this.

05:32.398 --> 05:34.599
There's a lot of bullshit
service animals

05:34.600 --> 05:36.267
in the world right now.

05:36.268 --> 05:38.308
I don't know if you've been on
an airplane recently.

05:38.309 --> 05:40.577
You still can't get a bottle
of water through security,

05:40.578 --> 05:43.472
but you can get an untrained
German Shepherd

05:43.473 --> 05:46.007
that's gonna take a nervous shit
at 35,000 feet

05:46.008 --> 05:48.410
'cause I don't like the bumpies.

05:48.411 --> 05:49.811
That's it.

05:49.812 --> 05:52.347
I'm not talking about guide dogs
and I'm not talking about

05:52.348 --> 05:54.349
animals that help you
when you're disabled.

05:54.350 --> 05:56.631
There's a whole nother category
called "emotional support"

05:56.655 --> 05:58.617
and it was started like,
for instance,

05:58.618 --> 06:00.619
returning war veterans
with PTSD.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.155
They give them a trained animal
that helps them deal with

06:03.156 --> 06:04.423
what they gotta deal with.

06:04.424 --> 06:06.592
But emotional support,
it's very broad.

06:06.593 --> 06:08.761
This is what I checked off
for my cat.

06:08.762 --> 06:11.029
Stressed-out.

06:11.030 --> 06:13.398
Who the fuck's not stressed out?

06:13.399 --> 06:15.067
Yeah, I'm having
a tough week at work.

06:15.068 --> 06:17.066
Uh, don't worry,
I'm getting a mulgy.

06:17.067 --> 06:18.567
Everything's gonna be okay.

06:18.568 --> 06:20.770
Mr. Noodles comes in on Monday.
No eye contact.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.505
They're biters. Not trained yet.

06:22.506 --> 06:24.273
Straight out of the jungle.
Yeah, that's...

06:24.274 --> 06:26.275
Rip your face clean off.

06:26.276 --> 06:27.756
Might throw some shit
in your cubicle.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.613
You might wanna wear a hat
this week so.

06:30.614 --> 06:32.979
Yeah, I was sitting next to
a woman on an airplane

06:32.980 --> 06:35.448
that had an overweight pug
missing a leg

06:35.449 --> 06:37.917
that had a vest cable
tied around it.

06:37.918 --> 06:40.238
I was pretty sure that wasn't
a working animal right there.

06:40.262 --> 06:42.655
That bread has sleep apnea
to begin with.

06:42.656 --> 06:44.657
So I don't know how
it's gonna help you

06:44.658 --> 06:47.660
with the cutest little
CPAP on ever, right.

06:47.661 --> 06:51.194
So I asked her I go, "All right,
what's the pug do?"

06:51.195 --> 06:54.464
And she's like, "You got me."

06:54.465 --> 06:56.466
That's what she said,
"You got me."

06:56.467 --> 06:59.002
"Not much.
I mean, sometimes I get sad"

06:59.003 --> 07:00.603
and then I bring the dog
with me,

07:00.604 --> 07:03.106
"and then I'm not sad."

07:03.107 --> 07:04.774
Yeah, yeah,
that's why we all have pets.

07:04.775 --> 07:07.774
Uh, nobody has a dog that's
crippling their self-esteem.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.876
You know, that's just,
you don't go to the pound,

07:09.877 --> 07:11.745
"I want an animal, but I want one
that's gonna make me feel fat,"

07:11.746 --> 07:14.080
if you have that back there,
like racoon or sugar glider

07:14.081 --> 07:15.801
or something weird,
I don't care what it is,

07:15.825 --> 07:18.118
I just want it to sit in the
corner and shake its head

07:18.119 --> 07:21.454
"while I eat a doughnut,
can you make it do that?"

07:21.455 --> 07:23.253
70 bucks. It's all you need.

07:23.254 --> 07:25.254
You go online, they'll send
you a kit, and then you

07:25.278 --> 07:28.158
can start annoying people
with your untrained beast.

07:28.159 --> 07:30.160
It doesn't just have to be dogs.
Here was the list.

07:30.161 --> 07:32.162
Dogs, cats, birds,

07:32.163 --> 07:35.165
uh, snakes...
Snakes were on the list.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.246
I don't know how you're gonna
keep a vest on a snake.

07:37.270 --> 07:38.535
That's gonna be tough.

07:38.536 --> 07:40.296
Maybe you cut some eye holes
out of a condom,

07:40.320 --> 07:42.770
roll it on there,
get a Sharpe write, "Service."

07:42.771 --> 07:45.473
You gotta identify it.
That's part of the program.

07:45.474 --> 07:47.474
Otherwise, you just have a boa
with a rubber on it.

07:47.498 --> 07:48.576
That's weird.

07:48.577 --> 07:51.011
A service snake is crazy.
Right, we can all agree on that.

07:51.012 --> 07:55.313
Like what if you go in a bar
and you're afraid of snakes

07:55.314 --> 07:57.815
and they there's just some guy
there with a mesh tank top on

07:57.816 --> 08:01.185
with a service snake, you know,
just hanging out.

08:01.186 --> 08:02.866
Now you gotta bring in
your service falcon.

08:02.890 --> 08:06.591
You know, somebody else has
to bring in a service mongoose.

08:06.592 --> 08:09.460
It's not gonna end.

08:09.461 --> 08:11.863
Emotional support.
It's very broad.

08:11.864 --> 08:13.394
People need these animals.

08:13.395 --> 08:15.435
So let's let 'em have 'em
and then everybody else...

08:15.459 --> 08:18.266
'Cause you can say you need anything
for emotional support, right?

08:18.267 --> 08:21.603
For me, two things. Mainly I
could say, you know, food.

08:21.604 --> 08:24.005
Obviously, you can take
a look at me.

08:24.006 --> 08:25.340
That's a crutch in my life.

08:25.341 --> 08:28.042
I'm alone a lot on the road
in hotels.

08:28.043 --> 08:30.942
So, you know, porn.
That's another one.

08:30.943 --> 08:33.245
I know you don't
wanna hear that.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.147
But those are the facts, right?

08:36.148 --> 08:38.549
Yeah, but food's acceptable
in a social setting.

08:38.551 --> 08:40.452
But porn, you know,

08:40.453 --> 08:43.621
I'm gonna have to register
my laptop as a service computer.

08:43.623 --> 08:48.323
You know, I can just get a little vest,
bring it out to an Olive Garden.

08:48.324 --> 08:49.992
"Sir, that's wildly
inappropriate."

08:49.993 --> 08:52.427
"I know, but I have anxiety.
So, uh..."

08:52.428 --> 08:54.388
I'm gonna go in this booth
for about five minutes.

08:54.412 --> 08:57.065
You might want to cover up your
mozzarella sticks with a napkin.

08:57.066 --> 09:00.135
"Shield the kids eyes, that's
the splash zone right there."

09:00.136 --> 09:02.102
That's what I call that.

09:04.237 --> 09:06.906
So I was looking at some photos
the other day.

09:06.907 --> 09:10.142
Remember that, when we used to
print up actual photographs?

09:10.143 --> 09:11.677
We don't do that anymore so.

09:11.678 --> 09:13.612
I had an old box full of 'em
and I took 'em out

09:13.613 --> 09:15.813
and I spread a bunch of 'em
on the floor in front of me,

09:15.837 --> 09:19.181
like I was solving a murder
or something.

09:19.182 --> 09:22.151
All the pieces are here.
Figure it out.

09:22.152 --> 09:24.153
Yeah, so I came across
a couple photos of me

09:24.154 --> 09:27.156
at a time in my life
when I was doing a lot of drugs

09:27.157 --> 09:29.025
- and, um...

09:29.026 --> 09:32.562
Yeah, I look great.
You know, I really...

09:32.563 --> 09:34.196
look a lot healthier
than I do now.

09:34.197 --> 09:36.229
And I stopped doing drugs
I feel like,

09:36.230 --> 09:41.301
I feel like that's been the missing
ingredient in my diet this whole time.

09:41.302 --> 09:44.637
Less meatballs, more meth.
You don't see that a lot...

09:44.638 --> 09:49.242
in men's health magazines,
but I feel like...

09:49.243 --> 09:53.076
Seriously, it's like a physical
of me now verse then.

09:53.077 --> 09:54.611
I'm not saying drugs
are good for you.

09:54.612 --> 09:56.613
I'm just saying,

09:56.614 --> 09:59.683
I'm saying some drugs are probably
better for you than some foods, right?

09:59.684 --> 10:02.218
Yeah, like you can do heroine
a half dozen times.

10:02.219 --> 10:04.120
You'll probably be okay.

10:04.121 --> 10:08.391
Try shooting up Ranch dressing
see what happens, right?

10:08.392 --> 10:11.525
These are facts.

10:11.526 --> 10:15.195
Facts. Sugar, that's a drug.

10:15.196 --> 10:17.564
Is everybody aware of that?

10:17.565 --> 10:21.301
I saw a documentary.

10:21.302 --> 10:24.404
On Netflix,
that's what they said.

10:24.405 --> 10:28.539
They said, sugar is eight times
more addictive than crack.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.141
However, it's exponentially
more difficult

10:31.142 --> 10:33.110
to get a blow job
for a Butterfinger.

10:33.111 --> 10:34.812
So don't try that.

10:34.813 --> 10:36.773
It's easy to get sugar, right?
That's the problem.

10:36.797 --> 10:37.948
It's hard to get drugs.

10:37.949 --> 10:41.018
You can get a candy bar at a
hardware store for some reason.

10:41.019 --> 10:42.950
Why is that an option?

10:42.951 --> 10:46.153
Has anyone ever needed a bolt cutter
and a Snickers bar at the same time?

10:46.154 --> 10:49.057
I need some Twizzlers
and some wood.

10:52.961 --> 10:54.362
Just make it harder.

10:54.363 --> 10:56.123
Make it harder to get food
that's bad for you

10:56.147 --> 10:57.932
as it is drugs
and you'd eat less.

10:57.933 --> 11:04.168
You know, like if it was this hard
to get pizza as it is cocaine,

11:04.169 --> 11:05.870
you know,
like you'd still eat pizza.

11:05.871 --> 11:07.505
Don't get me wrong, but just...

11:07.506 --> 11:10.975
Only on the weekends
with people you trust.

11:10.976 --> 11:13.376
Not gonna invite that one guy
who always eats half the pizza.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.378
I got no money this week,
but next week pizza...

11:15.379 --> 11:17.139
Yeah, yeah, you say that
every week, asshole.

11:17.163 --> 11:19.714
Just start rubbing tomato sauce
on your gums.

11:19.715 --> 11:22.217
Oh, yeah, that's a good...

11:22.218 --> 11:25.186
Yeah, that's a hundred percent
Papa Johns right there.

11:25.187 --> 11:29.057
That's not that stepped on
Little Caesars crap

11:29.058 --> 11:31.926
you tried to bring here
last week.

11:31.927 --> 11:34.427
You a cop?

11:38.164 --> 11:41.400
Be out at dinner
with some people, right,

11:41.401 --> 11:44.269
"Hey, you notice those three
guys have gotten up together"

11:44.270 --> 11:46.271
to use the bathroom
a couple times?

11:46.272 --> 11:49.138
You think they're doing
pizza in there?

11:49.139 --> 11:51.206
He had some cheese in his beard.

11:51.207 --> 11:54.044
"I was wondering.
You can see it plain as day."

11:58.481 --> 12:00.682
I don't know, man. It's just...

12:00.683 --> 12:02.518
it's tough for me.

12:02.519 --> 12:04.920
I just... I'm a very addictive
personality, you know.

12:04.921 --> 12:06.419
It's tough to eat right.

12:06.420 --> 12:09.422
They'll put put calories
on menus now, right.

12:09.423 --> 12:12.191
That doesn't help anybody
at all.

12:12.192 --> 12:14.593
That just makes you
feel shittier

12:14.594 --> 12:16.362
about what you're gonna eat.

12:16.363 --> 12:19.698
You know, it's like, "Yeah, I
guess I'm eating 3,000 calories."

12:19.699 --> 12:22.398
I might as well blow my brains
out at this point.

12:22.399 --> 12:25.101
They should put the exercises
you have to do next to the food

12:25.102 --> 12:26.669
and you'd eat less, right?

12:26.670 --> 12:28.671
"Yeah, I'd like to get
a seven layer burrito."

12:28.672 --> 12:31.152
"All right, sir, you have to get
on the StairMaster back there"

12:31.176 --> 12:32.875
for five hours.

12:32.876 --> 12:35.516
"Bring back a stamped receipt then
we can legally serve it to you."

12:35.540 --> 12:36.392
That's the only way.

12:36.393 --> 12:39.179
"Uh, no, I'm drunk.
I don't wanna do that."

12:39.180 --> 12:41.081
I just wanna sit in this chair.

12:41.082 --> 12:44.818
"What can I eat if I sit in this
chair, uh, hot sauce packets?"

12:44.819 --> 12:46.619
That's all we can give you.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.489
We don't make the laws.

12:51.692 --> 12:54.060
A lot of fat jokes tonight,
guys, all right?

12:54.061 --> 12:57.394
This is where I'm at.

12:57.395 --> 13:00.097
Uh. No, this is just...
This is what you gotta...

13:00.098 --> 13:02.599
Look, all black.
That's slimming, right?

13:02.600 --> 13:06.803
A jacket? We're here in Miami.
I'm not cold.

13:06.804 --> 13:08.605
This is called
covering up flaws.

13:08.606 --> 13:11.675
That's what you do.
Couple flaps of cloth.

13:11.676 --> 13:13.340
It does a world of wonders.

13:13.341 --> 13:15.676
Yeah, I've lived in L.A. now
about three years,

13:15.677 --> 13:18.879
and I've developed a condition
known as, uh, "Taco Tits."

13:18.880 --> 13:20.481
So that's not a...

13:20.482 --> 13:23.183
I call this one Carne Asada,
this one Poquito.

13:23.184 --> 13:25.319
It's a little bit smaller
for some reason.

13:25.320 --> 13:29.019
- Lot of food trucks.
- Man: Oh my Lord.

13:29.020 --> 13:32.022
Hah. It's not a good body
under here.

13:32.023 --> 13:34.525
If Jason Bourne had my body,

13:34.526 --> 13:37.361
the government would stop looking for him.
You know, that's why...

13:37.362 --> 13:39.096
He's only a threat to himself.

13:39.097 --> 13:41.298
He has, uh,
three to five days to live.

13:41.299 --> 13:45.169
Just put that folder
back in the cabinet.

13:45.170 --> 13:47.902
Man: Oh my Lord.

13:47.903 --> 13:53.241
The problem is that, uh, all
food's legal, for me at least.

13:53.242 --> 13:54.909
It's all legal, right?

13:54.910 --> 13:57.912
Anyone in here, you can go
and order 20 cheeseburgers

13:57.913 --> 14:00.353
at any place that sells cheese,
they'll just give them to you.

14:00.377 --> 14:03.017
They're not gonna take your blood
pressure, check your cholesterol.

14:03.041 --> 14:04.682
Just give you...

14:04.683 --> 14:07.118
I go to McDonalds right now

14:07.119 --> 14:09.387
and order like
80 chicken nuggets

14:09.388 --> 14:11.548
and I could tell the person
I'm gonna eat all of these,

14:11.572 --> 14:14.592
just, you know, I'm gonna pull
around to the front of your store,

14:14.593 --> 14:16.928
take my shirt off,

14:16.929 --> 14:18.489
I'm gonna dump a bunch
of barbeque sauce

14:18.513 --> 14:20.562
right between my taco tits,
right here.

14:20.563 --> 14:22.931
I'm just gonna eat 'em all
'cause it's legal, that's why.

14:22.932 --> 14:24.833
Fuck you guys, right.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.535
If you're gonna do that, wear your
seatbelt though. That's against the law.

14:26.536 --> 14:29.939
So you gotta be extra...
Safety first.

14:32.341 --> 14:34.876
Oreo's, Deep Fried Oreo's.
That's legal food.

14:34.877 --> 14:36.208
Someone just made that up.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.077
They didn't have to get
like that checked by...

14:39.078 --> 14:41.079
That just... yeah.
You ever had those?

14:41.080 --> 14:42.881
Deep Fried... like,
yeah, that's...

14:42.882 --> 14:46.285
Oreo's are already bad and
then they make 'em way worse.

14:46.286 --> 14:49.154
They deep fry 'em, they drizzle
some chocolate on 'em,

14:49.155 --> 14:50.355
sprinkled some powdered sugar,

14:50.379 --> 14:51.857
they, you know,
flung some Crisco

14:51.858 --> 14:53.055
and stuck a cigarette in it.

14:53.056 --> 14:54.723
It's like really bad.

14:54.724 --> 14:58.694
You can just get as many
of those as you want.

14:58.695 --> 15:00.863
I don't know.

15:00.864 --> 15:05.734
I'm in bad shape, though, guys.

15:05.735 --> 15:08.070
I went to the doctor and, uh,

15:08.071 --> 15:09.937
she told me
I have, uh, prediabetes.

15:11.605 --> 15:16.509
That's not the punchline,
but thanks for laughing at that.

15:16.510 --> 15:18.190
Prediabetes.
I didn't know what that meant,

15:18.214 --> 15:19.679
so I asked her and she goes,

15:19.680 --> 15:23.082
"Okay well, that means
that you could get diabetes."

15:23.083 --> 15:25.251
I was like, "All right, well,
that means, uh",

15:25.252 --> 15:28.251
everybody had prediabetes.

15:28.252 --> 15:30.486
Unless I got postdiabetes,
that's a bad one right there.

15:30.487 --> 15:31.921
"I don't want that one."

15:31.922 --> 15:33.923
Hey, guess what else I have.
Prebroken leg.

15:33.924 --> 15:35.258
Don't worry about that.

15:35.259 --> 15:37.760
That seems to be...
That seems to be okay.

15:37.761 --> 15:40.063
No X-rays necessary on that one.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.397
I'm gonna have trouble
paying you

15:41.398 --> 15:44.397
'cause I'm a pre millionaire
as well so, uh,

15:44.398 --> 15:47.167
let's split this one, all right?

15:47.168 --> 15:49.248
Don't tell me what I might have.
Tell me what I have.

15:49.272 --> 15:51.037
Let's work on those problems.

15:51.038 --> 15:53.707
I've got issues.

15:53.708 --> 15:58.811
For sure I have, uh,
acid reflux... heartburn, uh.

15:58.812 --> 16:00.377
I don't do anything about it.

16:00.378 --> 16:02.246
Nothing. I don't eat better.

16:02.247 --> 16:04.514
I just carry around
a pack of Tums.

16:04.515 --> 16:08.418
I can feel 'em right here.
It's like... hahah...

16:08.419 --> 16:10.420
It's like my life jacket,
right here.

16:10.421 --> 16:12.422
It's like the ring in
"Lord of the Rings."

16:12.423 --> 16:14.825
I'm rubbing it right now like,
"Precious.

16:14.826 --> 16:18.325
Precious Tums."

16:18.326 --> 16:21.262
It's my fat boy mints.
It's what I call those.

16:21.263 --> 16:22.863
That's your body's natural way
of saying,

16:22.887 --> 16:25.699
"Hey, uh, hey, maybe today
we shouldn't have the pepper"...

16:25.700 --> 16:28.269
"Shut the fuck up, stomach.
I know what I'm talking about."

16:28.270 --> 16:30.390
Give me some wings, a beer,
and a medicated Lifesaver.

16:30.414 --> 16:34.939
"We're doing this either way,
so get on board."

16:34.940 --> 16:36.900
So I'm pretty sure... no,
for certain I have that.

16:36.924 --> 16:39.644
I'm pretty sure
I have sleep apnea.

16:39.645 --> 16:42.765
I don't know for certain 'cause I don't
have anybody laying next to me at night

16:42.789 --> 16:46.017
to tell me that I am dying,
but I'm pretty sure that's...

16:46.018 --> 16:49.284
That's a disease you eat
your way into right there.

16:49.285 --> 16:52.887
Not always, but generally,
generally, sleep apnea means

16:52.888 --> 16:56.424
you're overweight and then you
hold your breathe when you sleep.

16:56.425 --> 16:59.294
Which I don't know how
out of shape you have to be

16:59.295 --> 17:01.429
to need a break during sleep,
but that is really bad.

17:01.430 --> 17:05.964
That's, that's the least amount
of activity your body can do.

17:05.964 --> 17:07.299
And it can't do it anymore.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.434
That's the point
you've gotten to.

17:09.435 --> 17:11.435
Your body has just decided
to kill itself.

17:11.436 --> 17:12.757
That's the point
you've gotten to.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.071
All right, rollover, fatty.

17:14.073 --> 17:15.839
Put your face
in the pillow right now.

17:15.840 --> 17:18.040
We're gonna, we're gonna start
with the stutter breathe.

17:18.065 --> 17:19.800
Get in there now.

17:21.480 --> 17:24.479
We're the fattest animal.
Did you guys know that?

17:24.480 --> 17:27.482
I just made it up,
but it sounds right, right?

17:27.483 --> 17:29.685
You had time to mull it over,
think about it,

17:29.686 --> 17:31.386
nobody yelled anything out.

17:31.387 --> 17:35.424
Fattest animals.
Sad, sack, sloppy, you know?

17:35.425 --> 17:37.993
That's...

17:37.994 --> 17:39.674
Let's just start saying
overweight, though.

17:39.698 --> 17:41.593
That's what I should start saying.
Not fattest.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.394
'Cause I keep saying that
and then at one show

17:43.418 --> 17:44.797
a woman yelled out, "Whales!"

17:44.798 --> 17:47.132
What about whales?
Whales are fat."

17:47.133 --> 17:48.934
She was fat shaming whales.

17:48.935 --> 17:52.137
She thought every picture of
every whale she had ever seen

17:52.138 --> 17:54.440
was just an obese
out of shape whale.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.881
And there was other whales out
there swimming around the ocean

17:56.905 --> 18:02.311
with 24 pack abs, you know,
and doing CrossFit.

18:02.312 --> 18:05.314
Fat whales sounds like a
conspiracy theory of some sort

18:05.315 --> 18:06.816
that somebody
would come up with.

18:06.817 --> 18:08.317
You know, they're like,

18:08.318 --> 18:10.478
"Yeah, yeah, I'll tell you why
the sea level's rising."

18:10.502 --> 18:12.187
It ain't climate change.

18:12.188 --> 18:14.854
It's these fat-ass whales.
That's what's happening.

18:14.855 --> 18:17.757
You got liberals like Al Gore
feeding 'em grilled cheesecake,

18:17.758 --> 18:19.726
they're getting fatter.

18:19.727 --> 18:21.527
Ocean level's rising.

18:21.528 --> 18:23.208
Don't think we don't see
you too, manatees.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.499
"We know what's going on there."

18:26.500 --> 18:28.735
Overweight.
That's the term we gotta use.

18:28.736 --> 18:30.934
Most over... the only other
animals that are overweight

18:30.935 --> 18:32.936
are the ones
that live around us, right?

18:32.937 --> 18:35.105
Like your pets.

18:35.106 --> 18:36.439
Somebody here has a fat pet.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.209
Or you know somebody with a pet

18:39.210 --> 18:40.970
that you walk in their house
and you're like,

18:40.971 --> 18:42.691
"Wow, I didn't know
cats came in that shape.

18:42.715 --> 18:45.382
That's, uh... that's"...

18:45.383 --> 18:47.423
They never take responsibility
for it either, right?

18:47.447 --> 18:49.249
They just blame it on
the animal.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.084
They'll say, "I don't know.
His metabolism"

18:51.085 --> 18:54.254
is eating a lot of weird shit."

18:54.255 --> 18:55.935
I'm pretty sure
you're feeding it too much.

18:55.959 --> 18:59.593
I think that is
the number one answer...

18:59.594 --> 19:02.129
I've never seen a cat at a
drive-thru at three in the morning

19:02.130 --> 19:03.594
just hanging out in line
with the cars.

19:03.595 --> 19:05.515
They're like, "Sir,
you gotta be in the vehicle."

19:05.539 --> 19:07.664
We're not gonna serve you
if you're not in a vehicle."

19:07.665 --> 19:11.235
"I got apple pay."

19:11.236 --> 19:13.037
Look it up.

19:13.038 --> 19:15.038
Dogs eating ice cream.
Put that on YouTube.

19:15.039 --> 19:16.540
Way too many videos.

19:16.541 --> 19:19.106
Yeah, just video after video
of dogs eating ice cream

19:19.107 --> 19:20.708
and the owners are just
incredulous like,

19:20.709 --> 19:23.444
"God, he's eating the ice cream.
Can you believe he's...?"

19:23.445 --> 19:25.312
Yeah well, I mean,
he eats his own shit.

19:25.313 --> 19:28.382
So I'm pretty sure that, uh,
cream and sugar's on the menu.

19:28.383 --> 19:30.252
That's not a weird...

19:34.356 --> 19:37.588
Just, you know,
all around bullshit food.

19:37.589 --> 19:40.558
Racoons. Fat racoons, right.

19:40.559 --> 19:43.294
One day they're eating fish,
living their life,

19:43.295 --> 19:45.296
and then they accidentally
wonder in someone's yard,

19:45.297 --> 19:47.165
get into a trash can,
they find a cheese steak,

19:47.166 --> 19:49.326
they're just chasing the dragon
the rest of their life.

19:49.350 --> 19:51.502
You know, it's just,
"Another one in here somewhere."

19:51.503 --> 19:53.423
All right, 30 diapers.
We struck out on this one.

19:53.447 --> 19:57.372
"Go next door.
They had lasagna last week."

19:57.373 --> 20:00.943
Stop giving, you know,
food and...

20:02.411 --> 20:04.679
Imagine if animals did all
the drugs we did, too.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.215
I mean, just, like if tigers
knew about cocaine,

20:07.216 --> 20:09.336
they'd leave their kids
by a river or something weird.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.949
Right, just be snorting a line,

20:10.950 --> 20:12.651
just talking about
gazelles they killed.

20:12.652 --> 20:14.820
"Man, five gazelles, one hour.

20:14.821 --> 20:17.023
No one's ever done it."

20:19.258 --> 20:21.327
Balls shrinking and stuff.

20:27.330 --> 20:29.498
So the drug thing's true.
Yeah, I used to...

20:29.499 --> 20:31.139
I looked great
when I was doing the drugs,

20:31.163 --> 20:33.902
and you stop doing 'em.

20:33.903 --> 20:36.905
That's what happens.
You get older.

20:36.906 --> 20:38.907
Yeah, some people
are nodding their heads.

20:38.908 --> 20:40.242
You know what I'm talking about.

20:40.243 --> 20:41.944
Like I still wanna do
a lot of drugs.

20:41.945 --> 20:44.109
I'm just... I'm just too tired
to do them.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.945
Does that make sense?

20:45.946 --> 20:48.314
"You're maturing." "No, I'm
exhausted." That's the issue.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.316
Like I can't go on
a two-day bender with you.

20:50.317 --> 20:53.853
I gotta get stamps.
I gotta iron my jeans.

20:53.854 --> 20:55.454
That's some old man shit
right there.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.324
When you start ironing
your jeans, stop doing drugs.

20:58.325 --> 21:02.392
That's the... that's the
tipping point right there.

21:04.995 --> 21:06.762
I don't know.

21:06.763 --> 21:09.203
I don't know what the... the whole
war on drugs is ridiculous,

21:09.204 --> 21:10.564
that we're still at war
with drugs.

21:10.588 --> 21:12.134
I can't believe that, right?

21:12.135 --> 21:14.103
It's like a huge waste of money.

21:14.104 --> 21:16.636
You know everyone complains about
the government wasting money.

21:16.637 --> 21:19.339
War on drugs, we've been at
that for like 30-plus years,

21:19.340 --> 21:22.041
and, you know, we're America,
we like to win wars.

21:22.042 --> 21:23.710
We're not gonna win that war so.

21:23.711 --> 21:24.991
We should get out of that,
right?

21:25.015 --> 21:26.479
I'll tell why
we're not gonna win it.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.947
If you're 16-years-old
there's not a lot to do

21:27.948 --> 21:29.348
in this country,
that's the problem.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.484
I mean, you're gonna go
to an ice cream social?

21:31.485 --> 21:33.483
Or are you gonna
eat mushrooms and laugh

21:33.484 --> 21:36.853
'cause your friend
looks like a bear?

21:36.854 --> 21:39.723
"Get over here, Mr. Grizzly.
Come on, let's take a selfie.

21:39.724 --> 21:43.460
No ones gonna believe
I was partying with a bear."

21:43.461 --> 21:45.128
Hah.

21:45.129 --> 21:48.098
Ah, this is Florida,

21:48.099 --> 21:51.431
for those at home
that don't know where we're at.

21:51.432 --> 21:56.169
By the time this airs I feel like medical
marijuana will be legal here finally,

21:56.170 --> 21:59.973
- and that's...

21:59.974 --> 22:01.975
- Yeah.
- Man: Marijuana!

22:01.976 --> 22:03.844
A lot of sick people here
that need it?

22:03.845 --> 22:05.943
- That's...

22:05.944 --> 22:09.647
- a lot of ailments.
- Man: Anxiety.

22:09.648 --> 22:12.016
Anxiety, yeah, that'll help.

22:12.017 --> 22:15.220
I've never wigged out
on pot before. That's like...

22:16.588 --> 22:18.923
Okay. All right.

22:18.924 --> 22:20.424
Yeah, I just... the whole...

22:20.425 --> 22:22.757
I feel like, you know,
the medical marijuana thing.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.660
I don't know how it's not legal
everywhere at this point.

22:25.661 --> 22:27.228
It doesn't make any sense.

22:27.229 --> 22:30.231
Because it's a drug,
I mean, if you know somebody

22:30.232 --> 22:32.192
that is like a cancer patient
or somebody in pain.

22:32.216 --> 22:33.734
You know that it helps 'em.

22:33.735 --> 22:35.803
You know that they've proven that.
It's a medicine.

22:35.804 --> 22:37.305
And now we're voting on
a medicine.

22:37.306 --> 22:39.146
I don't remember voting on
Oxycontin or Valium.

22:39.170 --> 22:41.172
They just made that shit legal.

22:41.173 --> 22:43.408
There's no rallies for Lipitor
or anything like that.

22:43.409 --> 22:45.410
Just kicking
a hacky sack around.

22:45.411 --> 22:47.011
Let's make an omelet
in this bitch.

22:47.012 --> 22:49.949
Come on,
put us some shrimp in it.

22:52.551 --> 22:55.420
I did like a half dozen shows
at medical marijuana rallies.

22:55.421 --> 22:56.985
That's really
where the problem is.

22:56.986 --> 22:58.486
That's why
it hasn't become legal.

22:58.487 --> 23:00.555
Because people don't take
that shit seriously.

23:00.556 --> 23:04.259
You know, it's always just a bunch
of jam bands and gyro stands.

23:04.260 --> 23:07.462
You know, there's not a lot
of legislation being passed

23:07.463 --> 23:08.964
or anything.

23:08.965 --> 23:10.465
I've never been to a
pharmaceutical convention,

23:10.466 --> 23:12.200
but I imagine
it's very organized, right?

23:12.201 --> 23:14.201
It's together, right?
It's in a Marriott somewhere.

23:14.225 --> 23:15.934
There's PowerPoint
presentations going on.

23:15.935 --> 23:17.269
They're in suits and ties,

23:17.270 --> 23:18.910
they're giving out
fishing trips and pens.

23:18.934 --> 23:20.806
And every pot rally
I've ever been to

23:20.807 --> 23:22.207
just starts off
with some random guy

23:22.231 --> 23:24.243
in a tie dyed
stumbling onstage like,

23:24.244 --> 23:26.945
"Hey everybody, check it out.
I made a bong out of a clarinet.

23:26.946 --> 23:30.146
Yeah, instructions to follow."

23:31.281 --> 23:33.115
"Hey, take a look at this
pie chart."

23:33.116 --> 23:35.818
Uh, that is an actual pie.
Billy's mom baked that.

23:35.819 --> 23:37.686
We're hungry as shit here.

23:37.687 --> 23:40.556
"Divvy that up."

23:40.557 --> 23:42.424
It's good intentions.
Don't get me wrong.

23:42.425 --> 23:45.127
Like 'cause there's always a guy
that wrote a speech

23:45.128 --> 23:48.361
and, uh, but that day he decided
to eat a pot brownie.

23:48.362 --> 23:50.463
Uh, so he lost his speech.
He's gonna wing it.

23:50.464 --> 23:52.431
That's a good idea
when you're high so.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.552
He's just up there struggling,
tripping out, you know?

23:54.576 --> 23:57.870
It's like, ah, glaucoma
something with that,

23:57.871 --> 24:00.540
um, itchy clothing.

24:04.708 --> 24:07.043
It always ends the same way
with the worst argument ever.

24:07.044 --> 24:09.579
Don't use this argument
if you're pro pot.

24:09.580 --> 24:11.147
"It's from the earth."

24:11.148 --> 24:13.750
Right, I mean, why would God
have put it here

24:13.751 --> 24:15.585
if he didn't want us
to smoke it?

24:15.586 --> 24:16.920
"It is from the earth."

24:18.989 --> 24:20.687
I just wanna be like,
"Yeah, excuse me."

24:20.688 --> 24:22.222
Uh yeah,
everything's from the earth.

24:22.223 --> 24:23.757
I didn't know
if you knew that or not.

24:23.758 --> 24:25.425
We didn't get a shipment in
from Mars.

24:25.426 --> 24:27.761
I don't know if you're gonna
start smoking arsenic,

24:27.762 --> 24:29.195
or do a bong hit of lava.

24:29.196 --> 24:31.831
"Let's settle that little
argument right there."

24:31.832 --> 24:34.167
Get Sanjay Gupta down here.
He's got a tie.

24:34.168 --> 24:37.201
He did two documentaries on it.
It's gotta be true.

24:41.472 --> 24:43.753
You know who I'll be happy for
once it's completely legal?

24:43.777 --> 24:46.476
Are the people
that own the head shops.

24:46.477 --> 24:49.446
You know the paraphernalia stores
that sell all the stuff for pot.

24:49.447 --> 24:52.946
But just 'cause then they can
finally be themselves.

24:52.947 --> 24:54.615
You know?

24:54.616 --> 24:57.685
'Cause they can't...
Everything in the stores for pot

24:57.686 --> 25:00.387
and they can't like admit that.

25:00.388 --> 25:02.389
They have to pretend
like it's...

25:02.390 --> 25:04.058
"Oh yeah,
this thing with the...?"

25:04.059 --> 25:07.061
Oh yeah, that six foot
glass bong with the.

25:07.062 --> 25:10.227
"Game of Thrones" theme on it
right there.

25:10.228 --> 25:12.029
That's for flavored tobacco
right there.

25:12.030 --> 25:14.031
And if you mention pot
in this store,

25:14.032 --> 25:16.500
I will throw you out right now.

25:16.501 --> 25:18.202
We also have scales
for weighing jewelry.

25:18.203 --> 25:20.304
If you're into that, and, uh,

25:20.305 --> 25:23.741
we got, uh, shaving cream can
with a false bottom.

25:23.742 --> 25:26.240
Put your house key on it,
front porch, totally believable.

25:26.241 --> 25:29.577
No one will know. Very discreet.

25:29.578 --> 25:32.780
And then there's a Tony Montana
shirt behind it with a weed leaf

25:32.781 --> 25:34.048
for some reason.

25:34.049 --> 25:35.409
It's like he didn't even
smoke pot.

25:35.433 --> 25:37.402
I'm pretty sure
that shirt exists.

25:39.421 --> 25:40.822
Nah.

25:40.823 --> 25:42.954
Uh, if you do drugs be careful.

25:42.955 --> 25:47.058
'Cause I don't know if you've seen a
show "Lock Up." You ever seen that show?

25:47.059 --> 25:49.794
It's on rerun now, but they bring
the cameras inside of the prison

25:49.795 --> 25:51.963
and they show you around
and they scare you

25:51.964 --> 25:54.766
so you don't think bad
for like two weeks.

25:54.767 --> 25:57.669
Not everybody but it's over
50% of the people in there

25:57.670 --> 25:59.234
they are drug offenders.

25:59.235 --> 26:01.136
And the average sentence
for a drug offender

26:01.137 --> 26:03.177
is longer than everything
except murder, everything.

26:03.201 --> 26:05.841
Burglary, aggravated assault,
sexual assault.

26:05.842 --> 26:07.776
It's messed up, right?

26:07.777 --> 26:10.846
That's why if you ever get pulled
over and you have drugs in your car,

26:10.847 --> 26:14.850
you know, you should
just rape the cop.

26:14.851 --> 26:16.515
You're saving jail time,
all right?

26:16.516 --> 26:19.218
Just bend him over the cruiser,
take 'em with the night stick...

26:19.219 --> 26:21.086
Whatever term you wanna use...

26:21.087 --> 26:22.688
You're gonna have great street
credit when you get to prison.

26:22.689 --> 26:24.689
Like, "What you rob, a bank?"
"Yeah, fucked a cop."

26:24.713 --> 26:27.326
So, uh, guess who gets
bottom bunk.

26:27.327 --> 26:29.995
Get outta there.
Get me some cigarettes.

26:29.996 --> 26:32.529
I'm running this cellblock now.

26:32.530 --> 26:34.097
I'm running it.

26:38.268 --> 26:40.970
So that's that. All the run stuff's
bad for you, though, right?

26:40.971 --> 26:42.972
Food, drugs, alcohol.

26:42.973 --> 26:45.808
Everybody's drinking tonight,
right?

26:45.809 --> 26:48.043
Okay.

26:48.044 --> 26:50.543
I like drinking,
you know, I don't...

26:50.544 --> 26:54.914
I don't like, uh, I don't
like people that drink tough.

26:54.915 --> 26:57.316
There's a lot of bad drinkers
out there, right?

26:57.317 --> 26:59.719
- Man: Yep.
- Probably one here in the corner.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.321
All right, yeah,
that's what I thought.

27:02.322 --> 27:05.158
Doesn't pay attention.
All right.

27:05.159 --> 27:07.079
Yeah, that's the problem
with bad drinkers though

27:07.103 --> 27:09.659
is there's no, uh,
there's no penalty for 'em.

27:09.660 --> 27:12.100
They just wake up the next morning,
they do it all over again.

27:12.124 --> 27:13.897
They're just assholes, right?

27:13.898 --> 27:15.899
There should be.
I have a solution.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.601
Is we license everybody
to drink, right?

27:18.602 --> 27:19.936
You don't have to take a test.

27:19.937 --> 27:22.602
You turn 21,
you get a drinking license.

27:22.603 --> 27:24.805
Then you can lose that
drinking license the same way

27:24.806 --> 27:26.273
you can your drivers license

27:26.274 --> 27:28.742
if you don't, you know,
drink properly.

27:28.743 --> 27:31.745
All right, not popular.
All right, that's, uh...

27:31.746 --> 27:32.979
You need a license to fish.

27:32.980 --> 27:34.300
You guys are aware of that,
right?

27:34.324 --> 27:35.749
To catch a bass
you need a license.

27:35.750 --> 27:38.285
If you order eight shots
of Jager, I feel like

27:38.286 --> 27:40.818
there should be some paperwork
involved, right?

27:40.819 --> 27:42.152
Hand that over.
You should have to look at

27:42.153 --> 27:43.753
their drinking history
for a minute like,

27:43.777 --> 27:45.556
"All right,
it says here five years ago,"

27:45.557 --> 27:48.358
you masturbated in a bar window.

27:48.359 --> 27:50.439
Yeah, it's on the list.
I don't need to look at that.

27:50.463 --> 27:52.396
"You're not allowed
to drink tonight."

27:52.397 --> 27:54.698
It's like a point system, right?
I have it all worked out.

27:54.699 --> 27:56.263
It's like a point system that...

27:56.264 --> 27:58.264
Here's what I have so far
for the drinking license.

27:58.288 --> 28:02.002
Um, if you're in a bar
and you just go, "Woo-hoo!"

28:02.003 --> 28:04.138
That's a warning right there,
right?

28:04.139 --> 28:06.459
Whatever's going on in your
head, shut that down right now.

28:06.483 --> 28:08.609
You wanna throw a dart
at the back of somebody's leg,

28:08.610 --> 28:10.578
that's not funny, all right?

28:10.579 --> 28:14.278
You vomit in a friends car, three
points on your drinking license.

28:14.279 --> 28:17.548
You take a shit in public, immediate
suspension of your license.

28:17.549 --> 28:19.817
You gotta take a year off,
regroup, get an instructor.

28:19.818 --> 28:22.353
You can't just do that
in a parking lot.

28:22.354 --> 28:24.155
You're not allowed, right.

28:24.156 --> 28:25.690
Makes a little sense now, right?

28:25.691 --> 28:27.458
'Cause right now
there's nothing.

28:27.459 --> 28:29.324
There's nothing to stop you if
you're a bad drinker. Nothing.

28:29.325 --> 28:31.359
The one thing you can do,
you can get a DUI.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.728
But if you get a DUI, they take
away your driver's license,

28:33.729 --> 28:37.398
but, you know,
you can still drink.

28:37.399 --> 28:40.935
That doesn't make sense now that
I said that out loud, right?

28:40.936 --> 28:42.470
Hey, no more drive...
You know what?

28:42.471 --> 28:44.772
Keep drinking though.
You're really good at it.

28:44.773 --> 28:46.304
You blew a .23
you should be dead.

28:46.305 --> 28:48.907
You're like an expert.

28:48.908 --> 28:50.909
Yeah, put a beer in a bag,
piss on some doorsteps.

28:50.910 --> 28:52.444
That's all we want.

28:52.445 --> 28:56.281
Ride a bike to work.
That'll help your self-esteem.

28:56.282 --> 29:01.353
Nah, you just take the drinking
license, you let 'em drive.

29:01.354 --> 29:04.553
Red Light cameras.
Nobody likes those, right?

29:04.554 --> 29:06.121
Okay.

29:06.122 --> 29:09.791
Okay, but you take that same
technology put it in a bar

29:09.792 --> 29:14.329
and then if you were hitting on somebody
you normally wouldn't hit on sober,

29:14.330 --> 29:17.299
you get a ticket
in the mail, right?

29:17.300 --> 29:19.832
Just a picture of you.
Look who you almost fucked.

29:19.833 --> 29:22.268
Look at that.

29:22.269 --> 29:25.104
That's a stool. You tried to have
sex with a stool for some reason.

29:25.105 --> 29:28.240
Eight points on your license.

29:28.241 --> 29:30.143
Get some tweezers.

29:33.513 --> 29:36.245
Yeah, I don't know if it would
stop drunk driving though.

29:36.246 --> 29:38.047
That's the thing.

29:38.048 --> 29:42.051
'Cause nobody really wants
to drink and drive, right?

29:42.052 --> 29:44.153
Nobody ever starts off
the night,

29:44.154 --> 29:46.022
"Let's get drunk
and hit a dude on a bike."

29:46.023 --> 29:49.892
No one ever says that,
but it happens, right?

29:49.893 --> 29:51.761
You know why?
'Cause when you're sober

29:51.762 --> 29:53.493
you're making good decisions.

29:53.494 --> 29:56.262
When you drink your decision
making goes out the window.

29:56.263 --> 29:58.783
Yeah, when I'm sober. I'm like,
"Yeah, I don't drink and drive."

29:58.807 --> 30:02.201
Ten beers later, you know, I'm eating a
taco out of a trash can or something.

30:02.202 --> 30:06.205
You know, like car keys have
lost priority at that point.

30:06.206 --> 30:08.441
Don't drink and drive.
I drink a bunch of Tequila

30:08.442 --> 30:10.307
and now I'm getting a blow job
from some lady

30:10.308 --> 30:13.043
with an Adam's apple,
I'm like, "All right."

30:13.044 --> 30:15.178
Ma'am, sir, if you can put on
a turtleneck or a scarf

30:15.179 --> 30:16.746
that'd be great,
I'm okay with this,

30:16.747 --> 30:19.717
"but I just need some
visual aids."

30:21.285 --> 30:23.887
All right.

30:23.888 --> 30:29.189
Some people don't like to kid
around about that, drunk driving's.

30:29.190 --> 30:32.059
Yeah, it's a serious thing,
though, I understand.

30:32.060 --> 30:33.820
Sometimes people get killed
by a drunk driver

30:33.844 --> 30:37.164
and then you see it on the news
or read it online.

30:37.165 --> 30:39.446
They interview the family
of the neighbors and the friends

30:39.470 --> 30:41.068
and it's like
always a good person.

30:41.069 --> 30:43.901
And then you're just like,
"Yeah, that sucks."

30:43.902 --> 30:45.769
You gotta think
just once and awhile though.

30:45.770 --> 30:47.571
There's gotta be a case
where a drunk driver

30:47.572 --> 30:49.873
gets it right
and kill a dickhead, right?

30:49.874 --> 30:53.344
They'd be interviewing the neighbors and
the friends and family and by like,

30:53.345 --> 30:55.546
"Yeah, he was, uh, he was sort
of a prick actually."

30:55.547 --> 30:58.749
We feel, uh, we feel really good
about it around here.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.414
He, uh, he kicked my dog
last week.

31:00.415 --> 31:02.083
We were gonna cut
his brake lines anyway.

31:02.084 --> 31:04.319
It was sort of a godsend.

31:06.021 --> 31:11.960
So, uh, pretty much my whole life has
been a series of poor decisions.

31:13.095 --> 31:15.831
Okay, not the joke again.

31:17.863 --> 31:23.067
That's the difference between a motivational
speaker and a comedian basically.

31:23.068 --> 31:24.936
Tony Robbins made all
the right decisions

31:24.937 --> 31:27.071
and then, you know,
I'm up here talking about it.

31:27.072 --> 31:30.074
"I fucking don't process food
correctly,

31:30.075 --> 31:33.242
and I did a lot of drugs."

31:34.410 --> 31:36.411
I don't know why that is though,
man, I just...

31:36.412 --> 31:38.947
I made like a series
of just shitty decisions.

31:38.948 --> 31:40.749
Like my mom did a really good
job raising me.

31:40.750 --> 31:44.986
I just... some other things,
you know, that I'm not sure.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.321
You know, I can blame my dad.

31:46.322 --> 31:49.322
He wasn't around at all,
like ever.

31:49.323 --> 31:51.490
I'm not trying to make it sad.
I'm just... facts.

31:51.491 --> 31:53.225
That's how I know
I'm not famous yet.

31:53.226 --> 31:54.993
He hasn't tried
to contact me directly.

31:54.994 --> 31:58.431
You know, ask for money
or anything.

32:00.500 --> 32:03.368
Literally last time I saw my dad
I was probably like 12.

32:03.369 --> 32:06.036
It was around Christmas and it
was like the first Christmas

32:06.037 --> 32:07.903
where I had money to buy gifts.

32:07.904 --> 32:09.384
Do you remember that
when you're a kid

32:09.408 --> 32:11.907
and you thought about
your bullshit chores

32:11.908 --> 32:13.668
and you're like,
"I wanna feel like an adult.

32:13.692 --> 32:15.144
I'm gonna get some gifts
this year."

32:15.145 --> 32:17.305
And they were shitty gifts
'cause you had probably like

32:17.329 --> 32:18.580
$21 to spend.

32:18.581 --> 32:20.621
But there was a thought there
that's probably better

32:20.622 --> 32:22.662
than anyone, you know,
than an adult would give you.

32:22.686 --> 32:24.383
So they were appreciated.

32:24.384 --> 32:27.319
You know, like my mom...
My mom likes sailing

32:27.320 --> 32:29.855
so I got her a Velcro wallet
with sailboats on it.

32:29.856 --> 32:32.058
I know.
She probably didn't use that.

32:32.059 --> 32:36.262
My grandmother liked to cook.
So I got her a wok.

32:36.263 --> 32:38.697
I mean, she wasn't Asian,
but I like stir-fry.

32:38.698 --> 32:42.432
It was on sale so that's.
Hook it up.

32:42.433 --> 32:44.500
And then my mom was like,
"We're gonna see your dad.

32:44.501 --> 32:46.135
Do you wanna get him a gift."

32:46.136 --> 32:48.671
But like I know you people
better than I know my dad.

32:48.672 --> 32:50.173
So I didn't know what to,

32:50.174 --> 32:52.475
you know, I didn't have any
thought process there.

32:52.476 --> 32:55.716
So I was like, all right, and I just pointed
at the first thing I saw in the store

32:55.740 --> 32:58.206
and it was steel wool.

32:59.380 --> 33:01.047
You know what that is?

33:01.048 --> 33:03.049
It's a shitty gift.
That's what that is.

33:03.050 --> 33:05.485
That's not a good gift
for a son to give to a dad

33:05.486 --> 33:09.222
unless he's a dishwasher
or a carpenter or something.

33:09.223 --> 33:10.423
Which he wasn't.

33:10.424 --> 33:14.157
That's like literally
the number one gift

33:14.158 --> 33:16.159
that you give a deadbeat dad.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.329
He'd be like at the Deadbeat Dad
Olympics, top podium,

33:19.330 --> 33:22.332
holding onto a piece of steel
wool singing his anthem,

33:22.333 --> 33:26.536
♪ Cats in the cradle
and the silver spoon... ♪

33:26.537 --> 33:28.805
Yeah.

33:28.806 --> 33:31.805
So my mom and him
were divorced and she, uh,

33:31.806 --> 33:33.507
you know, she's trying to be
a good parent

33:33.508 --> 33:36.510
and not show how much distaste
she had for my father,

33:36.511 --> 33:39.379
but... so she goes, "Are you sure
that's what you wanna get him?"

33:39.380 --> 33:42.149
But I know inside she was like,
"Let's wrap that shit up right now."

33:42.150 --> 33:44.352
That's, that's a great gift."

33:46.218 --> 33:48.953
And here's what my mom did to get
over at my dad a little bit.

33:48.954 --> 33:52.289
She put it like in progressively
larger boxes,

33:52.290 --> 33:55.526
you know, just like
a Russian nesting doll

33:55.527 --> 33:58.362
until it just got this big and
I walked in with a giant gift,

33:58.363 --> 34:00.798
like a little kid like,
"Hey dad." He's like, "Oh shit.

34:00.799 --> 34:02.439
I didn't expect to get
that big of a gift.

34:02.463 --> 34:05.133
And then he just unwrapping
them all... unwrapping

34:05.134 --> 34:06.801
till he got to the final box,

34:06.802 --> 34:09.203
and it's just a six pack
of Brillo right there.

34:09.204 --> 34:11.304
Yeah, that means
you're a shitty dad.

34:11.306 --> 34:14.308
I didn't say that but I think
the message was sent there.

34:14.309 --> 34:17.078
So maybe that's it.
I don't know.

34:17.079 --> 34:21.079
I did a lot of drugs
when I was young.

34:21.080 --> 34:25.116
I shoulda died a bunch of times.

34:25.117 --> 34:28.018
Yeah, Ketamine.

34:28.020 --> 34:30.355
They're using that
to treat depression now.

34:30.356 --> 34:34.058
That's not what we used it for,
but okay that's...

34:34.059 --> 34:37.726
GHB. We did that on purpose.

34:37.726 --> 34:40.328
That's known as
the date rape drug now.

34:40.329 --> 34:42.998
But that's not what
it was known as back then.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.199
You know, things change.

34:45.201 --> 34:46.935
You know, things start one way,

34:46.936 --> 34:49.016
and then they go through
some sort of transformation.

34:49.016 --> 34:50.518
Sometimes they get
a little seedy.

34:50.518 --> 34:53.105
You know, I remember when
a massage just meant

34:53.106 --> 34:56.108
you were going to get, you know,
your back worked on.

34:56.109 --> 34:58.911
And now you gotta specify that,
right?

34:58.912 --> 35:01.079
That's a tough job,
massage therapy.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.081
That's the only job
where you have to tell somebody

35:03.082 --> 35:06.752
whether they're getting
jerked off at the end or not.

35:06.753 --> 35:08.553
You can never be getting
your taxes done like,

35:08.577 --> 35:10.052
"This is all about deductions,

35:10.053 --> 35:13.255
you know, there's no hand jobs
at the end of this right?"

35:13.256 --> 35:14.590
So that's what happened.

35:14.591 --> 35:16.091
GHB, it's a natural occurring

35:16.092 --> 35:17.793
like, you know,
chemical in your body

35:17.794 --> 35:19.795
and it's started off
as a workout supplement.

35:19.796 --> 35:22.765
People would take
like a capful of GHB,

35:22.766 --> 35:24.567
they'd workout,
take a capful of GHB

35:24.568 --> 35:26.833
and then they'd pass out.

35:26.834 --> 35:29.474
They'd go into a really shallow
breathing state and almost be un...

35:29.498 --> 35:30.636
You know, almost dead,

35:30.637 --> 35:32.672
and then they'd wake up and like
ready to go workout again.

35:32.673 --> 35:35.241
And then somebody figured out
if you took a little bit less

35:35.242 --> 35:36.962
it was like fun.
It was like taking ecstasy.

35:36.986 --> 35:39.846
You'd dance, you'd party
and then some Russian guys...

35:39.847 --> 35:42.747
That's what I assume... figured out
that if you put it in women's drinks,

35:42.748 --> 35:44.113
you could take advantage of 'em.

35:44.114 --> 35:46.916
So that's,
that's the difference.

35:46.917 --> 35:50.119
That's the difference if you're
doing drugs that you decide to take

35:50.120 --> 35:52.655
versus somebody giving it to 'em
and you not knowing, you know?

35:52.656 --> 35:55.858
I mean, the best analogy I can come up
with is if you just had to get up early

35:55.859 --> 35:57.739
so you set your alarm
for five a.m. and you knew

35:57.763 --> 35:59.626
they were gonna have to wake up
at that hour

35:59.627 --> 36:02.829
versus somebody sneaking in your
house and then waking you up

36:02.830 --> 36:04.731
by raping you.

36:04.732 --> 36:07.167
I feel like
that's the best analogy so.

36:07.168 --> 36:09.069
Big difference there so.

36:09.070 --> 36:11.605
So we did this on purpose,
and here's...

36:11.606 --> 36:13.273
This is why poor decisions.

36:13.274 --> 36:16.340
I'm telling you like I shoulda
died a million times.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.842
One weekend we were up like
the whole weekend

36:18.843 --> 36:20.844
and then one
of our friends suggested,

36:20.845 --> 36:24.114
"Hey, we should do like a cap
of G and then pass out."

36:24.115 --> 36:28.986
And we did that, but we also
decided to go snorkeling.

36:28.987 --> 36:31.054
And I don't know if you were
paying attention,

36:31.055 --> 36:33.887
uh, the GHB makes you almost
stop breathing

36:33.888 --> 36:35.889
and snorkeling
pretty much breathing.

36:35.890 --> 36:37.891
That's what that exercise is.

36:37.892 --> 36:40.092
But I'm alive, I'm here.
I don't know how that happened,

36:40.116 --> 36:42.229
but good day of snorkeling,
let me tell you, man,

36:42.230 --> 36:44.932
this one fish was looking at me
like she wanted to...

36:44.933 --> 36:47.434
Okay, that's not how it was,
but that's...

36:47.435 --> 36:49.835
Good thing I'm alive, though,
that would be a bad way to die.

36:49.836 --> 36:51.556
They'd scoop me up off the reef
and be like,

36:51.580 --> 36:53.537
"Well, uh,
we don't know how he died,

36:53.538 --> 36:56.742
but we do know he was raped
earlier so that's, uh"...

37:00.812 --> 37:02.613
So that's it. I don't know.

37:02.614 --> 37:06.116
Maybe I... maybe I just didn't
have religion in my life.

37:06.117 --> 37:07.782
I don't know if people
are religious here.

37:07.783 --> 37:09.284
I was not religious.

37:09.285 --> 37:12.620
One summer we went
to church camp, I was like,

37:12.621 --> 37:15.523
"That's it, God. This is your opportunity.
Convert me right now."

37:15.524 --> 37:17.625
I've been raised as a heathen.

37:17.626 --> 37:21.829
And so we got on this bus and we went
to church camp in Lakeland, Florida,

37:21.830 --> 37:24.629
and this is what
they decided to do.

37:24.630 --> 37:27.999
Uh, first thing out of the gate
they got us into an auditorium

37:28.000 --> 37:32.137
and then, um,
the minister's son or the...

37:32.138 --> 37:35.874
I don't know which ones
can have sex, the, you know,

37:35.875 --> 37:37.342
not with kids, with women,
you know what I'm talking about?

37:37.343 --> 37:38.843
But that's, uh...

37:38.844 --> 37:40.342
Hah-hah, all right.

37:40.343 --> 37:42.423
But whichever one, I think it
was the minister's son,

37:42.424 --> 37:44.325
he got up there A cappella
with the microphone,

37:44.326 --> 37:46.782
and this is how they decided
to try and convert us.

37:46.783 --> 37:48.750
This started off...

37:48.751 --> 37:53.255
♪ Jesus, Jesus,
rocks you, rocks you ♪

37:53.256 --> 37:56.622
♪ Jesus, Jesus, rocks you... ♪

37:56.623 --> 37:59.743
All right, I'm out, Jesus. I gave you a
shot, all right, just start up the bus.

37:59.767 --> 38:01.327
Get me back on there.

38:01.328 --> 38:04.128
I'm pretty sure Freddie Mercury
wouldn't be allowed at this church camp

38:04.152 --> 38:05.497
right here so.

38:05.498 --> 38:08.168
It's a weird choice of songs.

38:10.351 --> 38:12.071
We're in Florida.
This is where Jesus lives.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.936
I don't know
if you know that or not.

38:13.937 --> 38:16.257
In Orlando there's a religious
theme park called Holy Land.

38:16.281 --> 38:18.140
- Man: Yep.
- Holy Land Experience.

38:18.141 --> 38:19.109
Jesus is there.

38:19.110 --> 38:20.943
They crucify him
three times a day.

38:20.944 --> 38:22.244
It's in the brochure.

38:22.245 --> 38:23.713
I swear to Allah.

38:23.714 --> 38:25.715
I'm sure it's a great theme park.
It's in Orlando.

38:25.716 --> 38:27.383
All the best theme parks
are there.

38:27.384 --> 38:29.384
You go in, there's
probably a locust exhibit

38:29.385 --> 38:31.951
and you get to stone somebody
to death at the end.

38:31.952 --> 38:35.788
I'm just saying if you go, I'm just saying
if you go to the Holy Land Experience,

38:35.789 --> 38:38.124
don't bring your kids.

38:38.125 --> 38:40.193
They don't wanna go to Orlando
to meet Jesus.

38:40.194 --> 38:41.661
They wanna...

38:41.662 --> 38:43.830
And they might have a good time,
but they're gonna have to stay

38:43.831 --> 38:45.264
in the same hotel
with all the other kids,

38:45.265 --> 38:47.185
you know, with the mouse ears on
and Hulk shirts,

38:47.209 --> 38:49.366
and they're just standing there
with a robe on

38:49.367 --> 38:50.900
and a fake Moses beard like,

38:50.901 --> 38:53.903
"All right, this sucks.
This crown of thorns hurts."

38:53.904 --> 38:55.505
"It's supposed to, all right?

38:55.506 --> 38:58.242
If you don't bleed,
we're not going to IHOP."

39:02.812 --> 39:05.712
I don't know. It seems like it
might be fun to be religious.

39:05.713 --> 39:06.880
I don't know. I'm just not.

39:06.881 --> 39:09.082
That's how it is. I try.

39:09.083 --> 39:10.884
I travel a lot
so sometimes I listen...

39:10.885 --> 39:12.719
Sometimes you don't get any
radio stations.

39:12.720 --> 39:16.623
I listen to AM radio and occasionally
prayer hour will come on.

39:16.624 --> 39:18.492
You know what that is?

39:18.493 --> 39:19.990
It's like people call in
with prayers

39:19.991 --> 39:21.558
and then they say 'em
over the radio

39:21.559 --> 39:23.027
and then everybody
prays for 'em,

39:23.028 --> 39:24.868
power of positive thinking,
you know, whatever.

39:24.892 --> 39:26.363
Which is a good idea.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.324
But one time when I was driving
through New Mexico

39:28.348 --> 39:30.801
I don't think they had a good
screener for the prayers

39:30.802 --> 39:33.537
'cause there was a lot of shitty
prayers that got through on this.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.038
There was some legit ones like,

39:35.039 --> 39:37.905
"Please pray for a man
with diabetes or cancer."

39:37.906 --> 39:39.874
But then one of 'em was,

39:39.875 --> 39:45.246
"Please pray for a woman to get her
garage door fixed at a good price."

39:45.247 --> 39:47.415
Yeah, I hope God has a
pop-up blocker for prayers

39:47.416 --> 39:50.217
'cause that's like getting a dick
pump ad in the middle of this.

39:50.218 --> 39:52.219
Can you imagine?

39:52.220 --> 39:54.752
Some kid that's just starving,
you know, somebody like,

39:54.753 --> 39:56.988
"Please God,
I need medicine and food."

39:56.989 --> 40:00.024
He's like, "Hold on, skinny, I'm
talking to Home Depot right now."

40:00.025 --> 40:02.727
They're trying to highball me
on these garage door springs

40:02.728 --> 40:04.629
"for some bitch in Ocala."

40:04.630 --> 40:07.165
I don't think he'd say bitch,
but whatever he would say.

40:07.166 --> 40:09.333
Maybe he'd be angry
by that point.

40:09.334 --> 40:11.734
Customer service sucks.

40:17.006 --> 40:18.773
Well, I hope God
doesn't exist though.

40:18.774 --> 40:21.443
Seriously,
I'm a compulsive gambler.

40:21.444 --> 40:22.944
I made a lot of deals with God,

40:22.945 --> 40:25.513
and I didn't hold up
my end of the bargain at all.

40:25.514 --> 40:27.554
I'd just be like, "Please God,
let me win this bet."

40:27.578 --> 40:29.414
I'll never gamble again."
And then I'd win it

40:29.415 --> 40:32.150
and just be like, "Well, I never
got a confirmation email."

40:32.151 --> 40:35.220
So I'm gonna assume
that one hit the firewall."

40:35.221 --> 40:38.623
Very tech savvy God
and my jokes.

40:38.624 --> 40:41.359
He's a computer programmer.

40:41.360 --> 40:44.026
Yeah, so addiction.
Maybe that's it, right?

40:44.027 --> 40:47.196
I go to Gamblers Anonymous...
GA... that's what it's called.

40:47.197 --> 40:50.365
It's just like Alcoholics
Anonymous and NA and all that.

40:50.366 --> 40:52.167
A little bit different though.

40:52.168 --> 40:55.103
And NA and AA for the year
anniversary you get a poker chip,

40:55.104 --> 40:58.173
which would be inappropriate
for Gamblers Anonymous.

40:58.174 --> 41:01.006
So we get little miniature
Corona bottles and needles.

41:01.007 --> 41:05.311
So that's pretty.
It's not true. Okay?

41:05.312 --> 41:07.379
Not true.

41:07.380 --> 41:10.316
I went to a GA meeting in Vegas
one time, Las Vegas,

41:10.317 --> 41:12.117
and it was packed.

41:12.118 --> 41:14.887
But with people that live in Las
Vegas that are addicted to gambling

41:14.888 --> 41:17.687
I was like, that... you should...
You should probably leave.

41:17.688 --> 41:19.822
This town, there's,
get on a highway.

41:19.823 --> 41:23.025
I feel like that's step one
right there, right.

41:23.026 --> 41:25.027
It's a bad place to live
if you're addicted to gambling.

41:25.028 --> 41:26.362
It's like being an alcoholic

41:26.363 --> 41:27.930
and living inside
of a whisky barrel.

41:27.931 --> 41:30.867
You know, it's not advised.

41:30.868 --> 41:32.168
You can gamble on elections now.

41:32.169 --> 41:33.967
I don't know
if you knew that or not.

41:33.968 --> 41:36.903
Yeah, any presidential race
they'll have odds on that

41:36.904 --> 41:39.824
which has got to be the worst way to
lose your money gambling is politics.

41:39.848 --> 41:41.941
It's bad enough sports,
but politics,

41:41.942 --> 41:44.022
how are you gonna explain
that to your family, right?

41:44.023 --> 41:45.623
"Hey, why don't we have
a house anymore?"

41:45.647 --> 41:46.880
"I'll tell you why.

41:46.881 --> 41:49.162
Because Latinos didn't come out
to vote in New Hampshire."

41:49.186 --> 41:50.447
That's why so.

41:50.448 --> 41:55.051
I read a bad pole on that one.

41:55.052 --> 41:57.988
I have a friend that's never
voted for president ever.

41:57.989 --> 41:59.909
Which if you're gonna do,
you need a good reason.

41:59.933 --> 42:01.758
He's a moron so.
That's what he says.

42:01.759 --> 42:04.839
I don't vote for president 'cause it's
just rich people running for president.

42:04.863 --> 42:06.760
And then it's rich people
running the country.

42:06.761 --> 42:10.197
I was like,
"Yep well, I'm pretty sure"

42:10.198 --> 42:12.733
that's who should be
running the country.

42:12.734 --> 42:14.067
I don't wanna elect a president

42:14.068 --> 42:15.602
that just got
their power shut off.

42:15.603 --> 42:17.070
You know, I feel like

42:17.071 --> 42:19.239
I want 'em better with money
than me, let's say.

42:19.240 --> 42:21.800
Yeah, I just saw the Commander in
Chief at a check cashing store.

42:21.824 --> 42:22.974
That was pretty cool.

42:22.975 --> 42:24.842
He was getting a payday advance
for an Xbox

42:24.843 --> 42:28.078
signed a coinstar receipt
for me.

42:28.079 --> 42:30.080
My friend's
a conspiracy theorist.

42:30.081 --> 42:31.749
He was like, "I'll tell you what else.
All the presidents",

42:31.750 --> 42:34.051
all of 'em, they all went
to Harvard or Yale."

42:34.052 --> 42:36.954
I was like, "Yep, that's, uh,
that's also good right there."

42:36.955 --> 42:38.455
I know how that works.

42:38.456 --> 42:40.336
Nobody wants to see
a diploma in the Oval Office

42:40.337 --> 42:42.705
from the University of Phoenix,
you know, it's not gonna...

42:42.706 --> 42:44.759
instill a lot of confidence
in the country.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.627
Yeah, I got all these degrees
in my underwear.

42:46.628 --> 42:48.863
No pants for those degrees
right there.

42:48.864 --> 42:50.932
I typed up one of my finals
papers with my dick.

42:50.933 --> 42:52.833
So that was pretty cool.

42:52.834 --> 42:55.237
Try that, you Ivy League snobs.

42:56.902 --> 42:58.503
Good imagery right there.

42:58.504 --> 43:01.339
There's at least four guys
in here that are gonna try

43:01.340 --> 43:03.174
to type with their dicks later
so that's...

43:03.175 --> 43:06.611
You're gonna need the standard
keyboard, no touch screens,

43:06.612 --> 43:08.580
some fishing weights,
three pulleys.

43:08.581 --> 43:10.883
All right, stop making...

43:12.951 --> 43:14.950
So anyways, it's gonna be okay.

43:14.951 --> 43:18.153
I'm gonna start doing steroids.

43:18.154 --> 43:20.055
They don't test for that
in comedy.

43:20.056 --> 43:24.926
So, uh, I'm gonna break
all the records.

43:24.927 --> 43:29.164
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why
people care that athletes do steroids.

43:29.165 --> 43:32.064
Who gives a shit, right?
It's entertainment.

43:32.065 --> 43:35.167
All of our entertainers
should be on drugs.

43:35.168 --> 43:37.302
You know, you wouldn't
listen to music

43:37.303 --> 43:38.937
made by people
that weren't on drugs.

43:38.938 --> 43:42.841
Why would you watch sports?

43:42.842 --> 43:45.010
Right, I want 'em to be
as big and strong as possible.

43:45.011 --> 43:47.343
You know, I don't wanna go back
and watch football

43:47.344 --> 43:49.744
when they had leather helmets on
everyone weighed 150 pounds,

43:49.768 --> 43:52.049
and they gently shoved each
other out of bounds, you know.

43:52.073 --> 43:54.550
I wanna see some roided up
linebacker hit a guy so hard

43:54.551 --> 43:58.087
his spleen shoots out of his ass, you
know, just flies into some kids lap,

43:58.088 --> 44:00.055
I hope he signs this.
He's a pro.

44:00.056 --> 44:03.255
I'm gonna sell that
on eBay later.

44:03.256 --> 44:05.524
Yeah, if you're against
steroids, you're a hypocrite.

44:05.525 --> 44:09.161
'Cause everybody in here does something
to enhance their lives or something.

44:09.162 --> 44:11.631
Coffee, caffeine,
you guys drink that?

44:11.632 --> 44:14.567
Yeah, cheaters.
You're all cheaters.

44:14.568 --> 44:17.069
Viagra, you know who you are.

44:17.070 --> 44:18.804
Pacemakers, right?

44:18.805 --> 44:21.285
But we're not gonna put an asterisk
on grandpas tombstone like,

44:21.309 --> 44:24.841
"You know, the last nine years,
kinda bullshit, if you ask me."

44:24.842 --> 44:27.010
I feel like he was cheating,
right, we all agreeing.

44:27.011 --> 44:28.878
"We're gonna cross that off
put 75 on there."

44:28.879 --> 44:32.249
He's not going in the Hall
of Fame, not for grampys.

44:36.717 --> 44:39.386
I'm getting older, though,
that's the thing.

44:39.387 --> 44:42.923
Maybe it'll help out
a little bit, a little HGH.

44:45.393 --> 44:47.753
You know I've noticed getting
older, though, the older I get

44:47.777 --> 44:51.031
like the less that I care
if people see my dick.

44:51.032 --> 44:53.032
I don't know
if that's a normal progression.

44:53.033 --> 44:54.798
Not gonna take it out.
Don't worry.

44:54.799 --> 44:57.334
But if it fell out by accident,
I'd tuck it back in,

44:57.335 --> 45:02.406
apologize to the front row,
bad zipper, all right, it's...

45:02.407 --> 45:05.876
It's true. I went to high
school here in Miami,

45:05.877 --> 45:08.158
and I would sweat in gym class
and I'd never take a shower

45:08.182 --> 45:09.977
'cause I didn't want to take
my shorts off

45:09.978 --> 45:12.680
'cause I didn't want anyone
to see, you know?

45:12.681 --> 45:14.715
And that's when people
shoulda seen my dick

45:14.716 --> 45:17.017
'cause that's when it was at its
top fighting weight.

45:17.018 --> 45:19.586
You know, it was like
aligned correctly,

45:19.587 --> 45:20.888
it was all the same color,

45:20.889 --> 45:22.956
and now it's splotchy
for some reason.

45:22.957 --> 45:24.625
I don't know why that happens.

45:24.626 --> 45:25.959
I've never taken it out
to suntan,

45:25.960 --> 45:27.425
but it needs to see
a dermatologist

45:27.426 --> 45:28.859
for something like that.

45:28.860 --> 45:30.361
Hair is not growing back
in properly.

45:30.362 --> 45:32.322
I don't know if they make
Rogaine for your crotch,

45:32.346 --> 45:33.864
but I need that product stat.

45:33.865 --> 45:35.499
There's something there, right?

45:35.500 --> 45:37.802
There's something with like
body image and wisdom,

45:37.803 --> 45:39.603
there's some correlation there.

45:39.604 --> 45:40.938
That's why when you go
to the gym

45:40.939 --> 45:42.440
it's just the oldest guy
who's naked

45:42.441 --> 45:44.361
flaunting around like,
"Hey everybody, I'm dying.

45:44.385 --> 45:46.140
There's my dick. Check it out."

45:46.141 --> 45:49.278
"What is that? A leaf on there."

45:53.682 --> 45:56.050
I used to be
an environmental biologist.

45:56.051 --> 46:00.352
And, uh, okay, thanks.
That's, uh, yeah.

46:00.353 --> 46:02.120
I used to be
an environmental biologist.

46:02.121 --> 46:05.090
Um, got out of that because
we're all doomed.

46:05.091 --> 46:09.094
So, um, can recycle if you want.
It doesn't matter.

46:09.095 --> 46:11.696
I was on the inside.
It doesn't matter.

46:11.697 --> 46:13.937
'Cause apparently, where we've
been destroying the planet

46:13.961 --> 46:16.400
is the towel section of hotels.

46:16.401 --> 46:18.066
Have you been in there recently?

46:18.067 --> 46:20.027
Next to the towels
there's always a little placard

46:20.028 --> 46:22.348
with a picture of a Lemur on it,
"Help us save the planet."

46:22.372 --> 46:25.807
Hang up your towels, reduce
water usage and detergent,

46:25.808 --> 46:28.143
"and we'll save
the earth together."

46:28.144 --> 46:31.346
I don't feel the animals
are seeing that towel money.

46:31.347 --> 46:34.046
You know, there's no way
there's a gorilla somewhere

46:34.047 --> 46:36.048
holding a picture of me
holding up a towel

46:36.049 --> 46:38.817
that I've used for the second
straight day to, you know,

46:38.818 --> 46:40.519
wipe off my girlfriends
stomach with.

46:40.520 --> 46:41.854
I feel like they don't know...

46:41.855 --> 46:44.890
- Sacrifices.

46:44.891 --> 46:46.959
Everybody should be
laughing at that joke.

46:46.960 --> 46:49.294
All right, right side
of the room don't act like

46:49.295 --> 46:51.160
you just dry your hair
with those things.

46:51.161 --> 46:52.561
Be honest.

46:52.562 --> 46:55.431
When you get into a hotel
you're a disgusting animal.

46:55.432 --> 46:56.932
That's why you pay
the extra money.

46:56.933 --> 46:58.634
You stay in a hotel,
you shave your pubes,

46:58.635 --> 47:00.315
you let somebody else
vacuum 'em up, right?

47:00.339 --> 47:02.271
That's gonna clog up your Dyson
right there.

47:02.272 --> 47:07.040
That's $500.
Wind, tunnel, technology.

47:08.876 --> 47:11.544
Towels. That's why the
whole planet's crumbling.

47:11.545 --> 47:13.479
Towels.
What about the beds in hotels?

47:13.480 --> 47:15.815
There's a lot of drunk and
vacation sex that happens there.

47:15.816 --> 47:17.496
Extra kids are born
we didn't mean to have.

47:17.520 --> 47:19.619
There's already seven billion
people on the planet.

47:19.620 --> 47:21.454
If they really cared about
the environment

47:21.455 --> 47:23.987
they'd have complementary
contraceptives on the nightstand.

47:23.988 --> 47:27.023
You know, like condoms or a
chimpanzee shaped dispenser

47:27.024 --> 47:28.758
that shoots out
morning after pills.

47:28.759 --> 47:31.161
You know, something that says,

47:31.162 --> 47:37.066
"We care about the rainforest
here at the Red Roof Inn."

47:37.067 --> 47:38.969
All right.

47:41.669 --> 47:43.937
So I was at a restaurant
the other day

47:43.938 --> 47:48.041
and I saw a baby crying
maybe like two years old.

47:48.042 --> 47:50.777
Ah, not a baby just...

47:50.778 --> 47:54.014
It was just staring at me, Rah!

47:54.015 --> 47:58.849
I was like, "Yeah,
that's the shit right there."

47:58.850 --> 48:02.019
I'd love to be able
to just cry, right?

48:02.020 --> 48:04.755
That's how I feel
all the time just, fah!

48:04.756 --> 48:10.661
Someone get me an iPad
and a sippy cup right now.

48:10.662 --> 48:12.329
'Cause you can do it
when you're a kid,

48:12.330 --> 48:14.370
but when you're an adult,
it's just not a good look.

48:14.394 --> 48:16.630
You know, especially as a guy,
right?

48:16.631 --> 48:18.866
Guy's aren't allowed to cry.

48:18.867 --> 48:20.935
Bunch of dudes here
in the front row.

48:20.936 --> 48:23.704
You guys,
you ever cry in public?

48:23.705 --> 48:26.307
No. You're not allowed to,
right?

48:26.308 --> 48:29.776
Women, yeah, have at it.

48:29.777 --> 48:32.109
You can cry right now.
People will help you out.

48:32.110 --> 48:34.111
They'll bring you a bottle
of water, a tissue,

48:34.112 --> 48:38.149
make a phone call for you,
you know, it's.

48:38.150 --> 48:42.053
Guy wonders into a food court
just starts bawling.

48:42.054 --> 48:45.156
Guess what?
Now you're a viral video, right?

48:45.157 --> 48:49.757
The sad guy weeps at Cinnabon.
Two million hits on that one.

48:49.758 --> 48:51.693
Gotta store it up his anger,
right,

48:51.694 --> 48:53.134
so he just punched some guy
in a bar,

48:53.158 --> 48:54.896
I'm sorry.
It's my wife, it's not you.

48:54.897 --> 48:57.866
I feel like that's how I cry
with my fist right there.

48:57.867 --> 49:00.667
It's healthy though. This is why women
on average live longer than men.

49:00.691 --> 49:06.004
'Cause it's healthy to cry and lets
out endorphins, stress, you know?

49:06.005 --> 49:08.273
And some women'll say,
"Ah, it's okay.

49:08.274 --> 49:10.475
I want my guy to be sensitive
and he can cry."

49:10.476 --> 49:11.810
That's such bullshit.

49:11.811 --> 49:13.378
Yeah, next time...
Try this guys...

49:13.379 --> 49:15.259
Next time your wife or your
girlfriend's crying,

49:15.283 --> 49:19.384
just sit down next to her
and start crying with her.

49:19.385 --> 49:20.616
She'll stop crying.

49:20.617 --> 49:21.950
That's how jarring
that is to her.

49:21.951 --> 49:23.585
She'll just
emotionally reboot, like,

49:23.586 --> 49:26.588
"What the fuck are you doing?
I cry you yell.

49:26.589 --> 49:28.090
That's the deal
we have worked out."

49:28.091 --> 49:30.425
So you could go break something
in the living room.

49:30.426 --> 49:32.594
"I'd feel a lot better
about this."

49:32.595 --> 49:33.996
Yeah, we need an excuse.

49:33.997 --> 49:35.717
Women can always say,
"I'm sorry I'm crying.

49:35.741 --> 49:37.529
I'm very hormonal.
I'm on my period."

49:37.530 --> 49:39.298
Look, I don't know
what a period's like.

49:39.299 --> 49:41.300
It seems crazy
from the outside looking in,

49:41.301 --> 49:42.768
but you have at it.

49:42.769 --> 49:44.470
"Do whatever you gotta do
for that."

49:44.471 --> 49:46.305
But to be fair,
we have hormones, too.

49:46.306 --> 49:48.307
Testosterone. Ten times the
amount that women have.

49:48.308 --> 49:50.576
We have that every single day.
Not five or seven days.

49:50.577 --> 49:52.678
Whatever your cycle is,
every single day.

49:52.679 --> 49:54.599
It's okay if you wanna yell
at me on your period,

49:54.623 --> 49:57.079
just don't get mad when I,
you know, fuck the neighbor.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.147
That's all I'm saying.

49:58.148 --> 50:00.082
It's that time
of the month again.

50:00.083 --> 50:01.751
I know.
It seemed like yesterday.

50:01.752 --> 50:03.152
But she had glitter
on her boobs.

50:03.153 --> 50:05.688
That's my trigger right there,
so that's...

50:05.689 --> 50:08.357
Walk a mile in our penis.

50:08.358 --> 50:10.056
These are facts.

50:10.057 --> 50:11.817
Remember I told you
I used to be a scientist?

50:11.841 --> 50:14.394
Trust me.
I looked it up on Wikipedia.

50:14.395 --> 50:16.162
These are all fact checked.

50:16.163 --> 50:18.298
Ten times the amount
that women have.

50:18.299 --> 50:20.659
The only time that's not true
is when a couple falls in love

50:20.683 --> 50:22.368
a guys goes down,
a woman's goes up.

50:22.369 --> 50:23.803
And then when you have kids,

50:23.804 --> 50:26.139
a guys testosterone
goes down again.

50:26.140 --> 50:28.540
So by the time you're married
and 40 and you have three kids,

50:28.564 --> 50:30.607
basically, you're just
like a, you know,

50:30.608 --> 50:31.875
a woman wearing Dockers.

50:31.876 --> 50:33.610
That's what you've become.

50:33.611 --> 50:35.378
All right.

50:35.379 --> 50:37.314
All right.

50:37.315 --> 50:41.251
So we start with cats,
we end with cats.

50:41.252 --> 50:44.251
It's a cat sandwich.
It's what we do here.

50:44.252 --> 50:45.752
It's like an Oreo cookie.

50:45.753 --> 50:47.354
Two cats on each end

50:47.355 --> 50:53.827
with a lot of dick
and drug jokes in the middle.

50:53.828 --> 50:56.663
So I used to have four cats.
Pretty cool, I know.

50:56.664 --> 51:00.264
And I found 'em all so they had some
sort of defect associated with them.

51:00.265 --> 51:01.985
Ah, yeah, like one of 'em
used to be abused,

51:02.009 --> 51:03.467
so it was neurotic.

51:03.468 --> 51:05.669
It would overgroom itself,
so half its fur was missing.

51:05.670 --> 51:08.739
It looked like a Tim Burton
character or something.

51:08.740 --> 51:10.441
Whenever it had
a urinary tract infection,

51:10.442 --> 51:11.842
I'd give it special pills
and food.

51:11.843 --> 51:13.377
Another one was molested
by its uncle.

51:13.378 --> 51:14.845
I don't like to talk about that.

51:14.846 --> 51:17.712
From the streets. Street cats.

51:17.713 --> 51:20.715
Yeah, so I used to find homes
for cats,

51:20.716 --> 51:22.516
but I don't do that anymore.

51:22.517 --> 51:23.884
I'm on the road
so one of the last ones I found

51:23.885 --> 51:25.586
was a mother cat,
five newborn kittens.

51:25.587 --> 51:27.254
You ever seen kittens
when they're first born?

51:27.255 --> 51:29.156
Look like little rats,
eyes are still closed?

51:29.157 --> 51:31.192
And kittens, I don't know
if you know this or not,

51:31.193 --> 51:33.691
the mother has to like
lick their genital area

51:33.692 --> 51:35.860
to make them pee and poop.

51:35.861 --> 51:37.628
Which if we had to do that,

51:37.629 --> 51:41.566
there'd be a lot less people
here tonight.

51:41.567 --> 51:43.368
In general,
that's how we operate, right?

51:43.369 --> 51:45.903
"It's your turn to lick the baby's ass.
Get in there."

51:45.904 --> 51:47.505
I licked it all week.
It peed in my beer.

51:47.506 --> 51:49.107
I'm done with that activity.

51:49.108 --> 51:51.673
You tap out after one kid.
I can't taste anymore.

51:51.674 --> 51:53.608
It's like batteries
on my tongue.

51:53.609 --> 51:57.946
I'd like to enjoy foo
d at some point so.

51:57.947 --> 51:59.447
Yeah, so they were tiny things

51:59.448 --> 52:01.116
and one was really sick,
lethargic,

52:01.117 --> 52:03.517
was like the runt of the litter,
something was wrong with it.

52:03.541 --> 52:06.121
And then the next day
the mother like ate, yeah,

52:06.122 --> 52:07.686
ate the sick kitten.

52:07.687 --> 52:09.121
That's what they do.

52:09.122 --> 52:10.882
Animals, they sense something
is wrong or off

52:10.906 --> 52:13.191
and then they just, you know,
they just snuff 'em out.

52:13.192 --> 52:18.363
Which, again, we don't do,
but if you think about it...

52:18.364 --> 52:19.731
Right?

52:19.732 --> 52:21.900
Have you ever been to Walmart
Sunday mornings?

52:21.901 --> 52:27.703
None of those people should've been
baby snacks when all that DNA passed.

52:27.704 --> 52:31.173
Yeah, I'm just saying. Let's say
from now on you had to have the kids

52:31.174 --> 52:32.574
and once they were born,

52:32.575 --> 52:34.643
if you sense they were gonna
be a douchebag,

52:34.644 --> 52:37.179
you just make a sandwich.

52:37.180 --> 52:39.048
A wrap if you're on a diet.

52:39.049 --> 52:42.348
Hold the mayo.

52:42.349 --> 52:47.053
Don't think about your own kids
in this joke, all right?

52:47.054 --> 52:49.388
If you're here tonight
you're telling me...

52:49.389 --> 52:51.724
If you have multiple kids
and you're here tonight,

52:51.725 --> 52:53.259
you're telling me
if you could've

52:53.260 --> 52:55.828
there's not one you wouldn't
have eaten, seriously?

52:55.829 --> 52:57.460
You know who it is.

52:57.461 --> 52:59.562
Burned down the shed and...

52:59.563 --> 53:03.266
I'm not saying
you have to eat your kids.

53:03.267 --> 53:05.635
But let's just say
it was legal to eat your kids

53:05.636 --> 53:07.470
till they were eight years old,

53:07.471 --> 53:09.005
you didn't have to do it,

53:09.006 --> 53:11.174
but your kids knew that you
could do it, right,

53:11.175 --> 53:13.506
just the threat was there
like, you know,

53:13.507 --> 53:15.667
they would just be mowing
the lawn, clean up the house.

53:15.691 --> 53:18.778
They wouldn't sass you in public anymore.
"I want this cereal."

53:18.779 --> 53:21.347
"You better shut up or I'm
firing up the grill right now.

53:21.348 --> 53:24.784
Get in the car."

53:24.785 --> 53:26.286
All right, I'm done.
Thank you, guys.

53:26.287 --> 53:28.656
- All right, that's...

53:31.289 --> 53:34.792
♪♪

53:49.738 --> 53:51.705
They'd be mowing the lawn,
cleaning up the house.

53:51.706 --> 53:54.186
They wouldn't sass you in public anymore.
"I want this cereal."

53:54.210 --> 53:57.644
"You better shut up or I'm
firing up the grill right now.

53:57.645 --> 53:59.514
Get in the car."

54:03.150 --> 54:06.851
That was literally
the last joke right there.

54:06.852 --> 54:09.153
That was the last word
I had to say

54:09.154 --> 54:10.654
on the whole fucking thing

54:10.655 --> 54:13.891
and you dropped a bottle
on the last fucking word.

54:13.892 --> 54:17.094
How're we supposed to end
that now?

54:17.095 --> 54:20.062
This... I was gonna... hah.

54:20.063 --> 54:22.597
This is how it was gonna go.
This is how it was gonna go.

54:22.598 --> 54:23.998
"Get in the car."

54:23.999 --> 54:25.799
And then I was gonna be like,
Thank you, guys.

54:25.823 --> 54:28.136
And you,
very fucking, goddamn...

54:28.137 --> 54:30.104
Gotta shoot
the whole thing again.

54:30.105 --> 54:32.474
The whole thing we have to do.
We can't just pick up that...

54:35.944 --> 54:39.577
Fucking weak bladdered
motherfuckers...

54:39.578 --> 54:41.713
Lisa made an announcement
at the beginning.

54:41.714 --> 54:43.047
"Hey, go to the bathroom now."

54:43.048 --> 54:46.684
Not one person got up
when you could've.

54:46.685 --> 54:49.688
Ah, I'll get through it
'cause I...

54:50.856 --> 54:52.690
I hope all of you die
in a hurricane.

54:52.691 --> 54:54.022
That guy how he goes,

54:54.023 --> 54:56.926
"Hurricane Matthew
sweeps you away."

54:59.729 --> 55:01.530
Ah, that was tragic.

55:01.531 --> 55:05.434
No, that guy got up to piss
ten minutes into the special.

55:06.736 --> 55:09.671
I've known him
my whole goddamn life.

55:09.672 --> 55:11.370
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

55:11.371 --> 55:12.704
I'm gonna do the last line

55:12.705 --> 55:14.139
because it's the last
fucking line,

55:14.140 --> 55:16.909
and then I need to say,
and then I need to say,

55:16.910 --> 55:19.811
Hey guys, thank you.
Then you go, blah.

55:19.812 --> 55:21.313
And then I'm gonna walk off,

55:21.314 --> 55:24.551
and then we're gonna do some
other things real quick.

55:27.484 --> 55:29.685
Son of a bitch.

55:29.686 --> 55:33.422
How does the last line even go?
Okay, okay, here we go.

55:33.423 --> 55:35.158
You ready?

55:35.825 --> 55:38.227
Shit.

55:38.228 --> 55:41.997
- All right.

55:41.998 --> 55:45.131
Shut up.

55:45.132 --> 55:46.966
All right.

55:46.967 --> 55:49.735
Okay, here we go.

55:49.736 --> 55:52.972
All right, I'm not saying
you have to eat your kids,

55:52.973 --> 55:55.107
but let's just say it was legal
to eat your kids

55:55.108 --> 55:57.310
till they're eight years old,
all right,

55:57.311 --> 55:58.544
you don't have to do it,

55:58.545 --> 56:00.044
but your kids know that
you can do it.

56:00.045 --> 56:01.678
Just the threat is there, right?

56:01.679 --> 56:03.546
They'd be mowing the lawn,
clean up the house.

56:03.547 --> 56:06.227
They wouldn't sass you in public
anymore like, "I want this cereal."

56:06.251 --> 56:08.723
"You better shut up or I'm
firing up the grill right now."

56:08.724 --> 56:10.720
All right,
let's hold on a second.

56:10.721 --> 56:12.921
Now that sucks 'cause you guys
didn't even fucking laugh

56:12.945 --> 56:14.424
'cause you just heard the joke.

56:14.425 --> 56:17.424
Of course you just heard
the fucking joke.

56:17.425 --> 56:21.561
Don't sit there and be like,
"We heard this one already."

56:21.562 --> 56:23.063
You guys suck.

56:23.064 --> 56:25.966
We're gonna have to edit
all this fucking laughter

56:25.967 --> 56:28.935
from behind my head so you can't
see my fucking mouth moving.

56:28.936 --> 56:31.171
What are they laughing at?
Oh, yeah.

56:31.172 --> 56:33.937
We're gonna do it one more time.

56:33.938 --> 56:37.274
All right, I need you
to laugh appropriately.

56:37.275 --> 56:39.675
That's the last fucking joke.
You did it good the first time.

56:39.699 --> 56:41.245
And then this guy fucking

56:41.246 --> 56:45.682
panicked over here and knocked his
beer... aha... anymore, all right.

56:45.683 --> 56:47.619
You guys ready? One more time?

56:49.320 --> 56:51.051
And then I'm gonna say goodbye

56:51.052 --> 56:52.572
and then you're
supposed to clap a lot.

56:52.596 --> 56:53.964
I have to fucking
coach you guys.

56:55.190 --> 56:57.057
Where the fucking
punchline is, Charlie.

56:57.058 --> 56:58.859
- Man ♪2. Fire up the grill.

56:58.860 --> 57:01.629
Wow. This is gonna be good
'cause I doubt

57:01.630 --> 57:04.164
we're gonna get this
on the first take.

57:04.165 --> 57:06.765
'Cause I feel like you guys are
gonna laugh at the wrong parts now

57:06.789 --> 57:08.532
and it's just gonna,
it's gonna look stupid.

57:08.533 --> 57:10.234
Man: He has to gonna
wash his hands again.

57:10.235 --> 57:12.036
Forrest:
Yeah, we're almost done.

57:12.037 --> 57:13.904
- Man: I gotta pee again.

57:13.905 --> 57:16.240
- Man: Yeah, really.
- Forrest: Holy shit, Charlie.

57:16.241 --> 57:18.121
All right. No, no, no, no, okay.
You guys ready?

57:18.145 --> 57:19.443
- All: Yeah.

57:19.444 --> 57:21.113
All right.

57:24.113 --> 57:27.115
Okay.

57:27.116 --> 57:30.985
I'm not saying
you have to eat your kids.

57:30.986 --> 57:32.920
But let's just say
it was legal to eat your kids

57:32.921 --> 57:36.424
till they were eight years old,
you didn't have to do it,

57:36.425 --> 57:38.226
but your kids knew
that you could do it.

57:38.227 --> 57:41.226
Right, just the threat
was there, like, you know,

57:41.227 --> 57:43.728
they would just be mowing
the lawn, clean up the house.

57:43.729 --> 57:46.209
They wouldn't sass you in public
anymore, "I want this cereal."

57:46.233 --> 57:48.506
"You better shut up or I'm
firing up the grill right now.

57:48.507 --> 57:52.470
- Get in the car."

57:52.471 --> 57:53.972
All right, I'm done.
Thank you, guys.

57:53.973 --> 57:55.708
- All right, that's...

57:58.374 --> 57:59.575
All right.
