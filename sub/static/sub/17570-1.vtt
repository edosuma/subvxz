04:57.814 --> 05:02.801
Captain, winds gusting to 110. If they
get to 130, we're verging category five.

05:05.755 --> 05:09.553
Put her back into the wind, Woods.

05:09.591 --> 05:12.047
Forty-five degrees down swell.

05:44.079 --> 05:47.148
Captain, the barge
is taking on water.

05:47.226 --> 05:49.105
Captain!

05:49.144 --> 05:51.752
I've got eyes,
for Christ's sakes.

05:51.790 --> 05:55.319
I've seen her through worse than this,
so calm down and stand your station.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.468
Woods!

05:57.545 --> 06:02.033
Forty-five degrees the swell.

06:07.942 --> 06:10.319
Green water!

06:40.089 --> 06:42.007
Steve! Engine room!

06:42.084 --> 06:43.925
Richie, the door's jammed.
I can't get in!

06:44.002 --> 06:47.033
Damn! If water stalls the engine,
man, we're history.

06:50.255 --> 06:52.365
- Hiko, take the torch and cut the door.
- Yeah, yeah!

06:52.404 --> 06:56.968
- I'm goin' up top.
Hiko, let me help you with that.

07:03.336 --> 07:07.633
Captain, recommend new course heading:
2-2-9 degrees magnetic.

07:07.711 --> 07:10.204
Captain? Captain.

07:10.281 --> 07:13.196
Once we're in the eye,
we'll have calm seas for two hours.

07:13.234 --> 07:15.153
We can make repairs,
steady the barge.

07:15.191 --> 07:17.109
Skipper, should I head for the eye?

07:17.186 --> 07:19.411
What the hell is goin' on up here?

07:19.449 --> 07:21.559
Captain, the engine room
is taking on water.

07:21.636 --> 07:24.629
Then pump it out, mister.
You're the bloody engineer.

07:24.667 --> 07:28.387
We can't get in. The bulkhead
took a hit, and the door's wedged tight.

07:28.465 --> 07:30.421
Hiko's cuttin' it now.

07:30.460 --> 07:32.378
Jesus Christ, the barge!

07:37.365 --> 07:40.971
- We gotta cut that damn thing loose!
- That's not an option, Mr. Baker.

07:41.009 --> 07:44.270
Skipper, should I head for the breach?
I need an answer now. I'm losin' her.

07:45.805 --> 07:48.912
- Winds 125, Captain!
- Captain, take a look!

07:48.950 --> 07:52.096
That barge goes down,
we go down with it!

07:52.173 --> 07:54.628
Well, that's a chance I'll take.

07:58.157 --> 08:00.268
I'm cuttin' it loose.

08:00.306 --> 08:02.646
- Stay away from that door, mister.

08:04.180 --> 08:07.480
I mean, what's so precious
about your goddamn cargo, Captain?

08:07.556 --> 08:10.318
The cargo is mine.

08:10.357 --> 08:13.963
I've leveraged everything
I own against it.

08:14.001 --> 08:16.034
And it's not insured.

08:16.111 --> 08:18.605
Christ, what's the matter
with those people?

08:18.643 --> 08:22.403
So I go out that door, you shoot me?
I stay here, we're all dead!

08:31.341 --> 08:33.374
Get the tank!
Hold the tank!

09:06.596 --> 09:09.588
Let me tell you something.

09:09.666 --> 09:11.929
You ever put a gun
in my face again-

09:12.005 --> 09:13.770
And you'll what?

09:16.379 --> 09:18.258
You figure it out.

09:33.911 --> 09:36.020
Sir, what about Foster's idea?

09:36.097 --> 09:39.128
I can reach the eye.

10:25.816 --> 10:28.731
I've let you down, lad.

10:28.808 --> 10:31.685
The water's coming in
faster than it's going out.

10:31.762 --> 10:35.023
I can't believe we were stupid enough
to sign on with that guy again.

10:35.099 --> 10:39.089
Maricon, ese got a gun on you, man.
I would've decked that son of a bitch.

10:39.127 --> 10:43.577
He had us pullin' 500 tons of lumber
and steel, uninsured, in a typhoon,

10:43.655 --> 10:46.186
a hundred miles
from any normal shipping lane.

10:46.263 --> 10:50.828
And Woods tells me Foster
got tossed out of the Navy
for striking a superior officer.

10:50.905 --> 10:53.322
- Hey, Hiko.
- Comin' through.

10:53.398 --> 10:55.968
I'll tell you one thing, Stevie.
It's the last time we make a move...

10:56.045 --> 10:59.997
- for percentage of cargo
instead of a salary.
- Damn straight. Damn straight.

11:00.074 --> 11:02.874
- I told you it was a bad idea.
- My idea? It was your idea.

11:02.951 --> 11:04.792
It was your idea.
What are you talking about?

11:07.439 --> 11:09.779
How is it?

11:09.818 --> 11:12.196
- It's bad.
- Define bad.

11:12.273 --> 11:14.651
- We're sinking.
- That's bad.

11:16.493 --> 11:20.329
So does anyone
have any suggestions?

11:20.406 --> 11:23.168
Mayday, mayday, mayday.
Hello, mayday. Come back, please.

11:23.245 --> 11:25.815
- We got about four days of supplies.
- What is this?

11:25.891 --> 11:29.114
That's food and that's water.

11:29.152 --> 11:31.109
Put that back, okay?
We're gonna distribute-

11:31.185 --> 11:34.600
- Fifty-mile range. Piece of junk.

11:38.743 --> 11:40.891
Hey, you buy this shit?

11:40.929 --> 11:43.961
Wait, wait, wait!
I'm picking up a contact.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.301
There might be another ship
in the eye with us.

11:52.055 --> 11:55.124
Twelve miles out.
Speed: zero knots.

11:55.162 --> 11:58.500
- It's dead in the water,
but it's really big.
- Let's hail it, Foster.

11:58.576 --> 12:02.566
Ahoy, vessel, latitude 29 degrees south,
Iongitude 1-7-9 degrees east.

12:02.643 --> 12:06.441
This is the Sea Star. We are 12 miles
northwest of your position.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.666
Come back.

12:08.704 --> 12:12.195
So where the hell
is the captain?

12:39.893 --> 12:41.850
I'm busy.

12:41.888 --> 12:43.883
Skipper,
there's a ship in the eye with us.

12:43.959 --> 12:46.108
Dead in the water,
about 12 miles out.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.327
Dead in the water?

12:51.824 --> 12:53.972
I'll be there in a minute.

13:02.297 --> 13:04.138
Dead in the water.

13:18.985 --> 13:21.287
- Captain?

13:21.364 --> 13:23.129
Dead ahead, 300 yards.

13:24.547 --> 13:26.427
Hail it, Woods.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.726
Unidentified vessel,
this is the Sea Star...

13:29.803 --> 13:32.335
approaching from the northwest,
300 yards out.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.059
Dead ahead, 300 yards.

13:42.309 --> 13:44.842
Unidentified vessel,
this is the Sea Star...

13:44.918 --> 13:47.259
approaching from the northwest,
300 yards out.

13:47.297 --> 13:49.177
Please come back. Over.

13:49.215 --> 13:52.092
- You see anything?
- Nope. Not a thing.

13:59.573 --> 14:02.028
That ain't ours, brother.

14:16.874 --> 14:19.368
Unidentified vessel,
this is the Sea Star...

14:19.444 --> 14:21.478
approaching from the northwest,
200 yards out.

14:21.555 --> 14:23.396
Come back. Over.

14:27.654 --> 14:31.568
This is the Sea Star
approaching from the northwest.

14:31.644 --> 14:33.524
Is anybody there? Over.

14:35.135 --> 14:37.015
She looks Russian.

14:47.104 --> 14:52.015
"The Academic Vladislav Volkov,
missile and satellite tracking ship.

14:52.091 --> 14:56.619
45, 000 tons full gross,
642 feet, two steam turbines.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.802
Ship's complement: 300.
Armament: none. "

14:59.840 --> 15:02.679
She's fitted for scientific
purposes. Their biggest.

15:02.718 --> 15:07.167
"Forty-two labs, five machine shops
outfitted with advanced robotics.

15:07.245 --> 15:09.853
Three parabolic dishes can maintain
simultaneous communication...

15:09.930 --> 15:12.500
with several spacecraft. "

15:12.577 --> 15:15.799
Ahoy, the Vladislav Volkov!

15:16.989 --> 15:19.712
I'm the captain of the Sea Star.

15:19.790 --> 15:21.630
Is there anyone aboard?

15:22.858 --> 15:27.308
Ahoy! Baker.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.070
Break out the shotguns,
the flashlights and the walkies.

15:30.147 --> 15:32.526
- We're goin' aboard.
- Shit.

15:48.216 --> 15:50.786
Jesus Christ.
This is kind of stupid, Stevie.

15:50.863 --> 15:52.705
Shh. Come on.

15:54.315 --> 15:56.541
Very stupid.

16:19.251 --> 16:22.090
Stevie.
This is very stupid, what we're doing.

16:33.445 --> 16:35.325
Stevie. Stevie!

16:36.438 --> 16:38.586
Those are bullet holes, Stevie.

16:38.624 --> 16:41.924
Shit, I don't like this at all, man.
This is bullshit.

16:48.561 --> 16:50.402
Ahoy, the bridge!

16:55.274 --> 16:57.154
Anyone aboard?

17:26.655 --> 17:28.496
The bridge is deserted.

17:47.908 --> 17:50.248
What the hell
happened in here?

18:13.803 --> 18:16.104
What a mess.

18:18.253 --> 18:21.590
- Looks like somebody
powered it down, Captain.

18:25.350 --> 18:27.767
Captain? Captain,
do you see anything?

18:27.844 --> 18:31.066
You'll be the first to know, Woods.

18:31.143 --> 18:34.672
- What do you think? Pirates?
- Russian Mafia, probably.

18:36.437 --> 18:38.432
Pipe down. Check the radio.

18:40.388 --> 18:42.268
It's smashed.

18:52.740 --> 18:56.846
These logs are worthless,
unless somebody reads Russian.

18:56.922 --> 19:01.257
That storm wall is 16 miles due east.
Captain, you've got an hour and a half.

19:01.372 --> 19:04.211
He's, uh, thinking, Foster.

19:04.327 --> 19:06.704
You know, something
you were paid to do?

19:08.162 --> 19:12.191
You thinking
what I'm thinking? Huh?

19:12.229 --> 19:14.953
- What?

19:15.030 --> 19:17.945
Salvage? Salvage, baby.

19:18.022 --> 19:21.705
You all signed on for a percentage.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.774
But you never figured
I'd bring you this, did you?

19:24.850 --> 19:27.152
A ship abandoned
in international waters.

19:27.229 --> 19:29.876
Maritime law says
she's a derelict.

19:29.953 --> 19:34.326
All we have to do is tow her to safety,
slap a salvage lien on her,

19:34.441 --> 19:39.620
and the Russian government has to pay us
100/0 of her value to get her back.

19:39.659 --> 19:42.037
Richie, put a number
on her for me.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.684
Well, let's see. There's
three parabolic satellite dishes.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.871
One of them's
kind of fucked up.

19:46.947 --> 19:51.666
Forty-two labs all primed with,
uh, state-of-the-art stuff.

19:51.781 --> 19:54.198
Let's see. We're talking...

19:54.313 --> 19:56.307
two hundred?

19:58.802 --> 20:02.407
- Three hundred million?
- $300 million.

20:06.551 --> 20:08.775
That's what's comin' our way.

20:08.852 --> 20:11.538
The opportunity of a lifetime
if we play our cards right.

20:11.614 --> 20:13.494
That's what, about 30 grand apiece?

20:13.609 --> 20:17.139
- Three hundred G's apiece.
- Three hundred G's!

20:17.216 --> 20:18.788
That's at one percent?

20:18.827 --> 20:21.627
I'm willing to change all that,

20:21.704 --> 20:24.159
cut you in for ten percent.

20:24.236 --> 20:26.845
That's $3 million each.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.069
- What do you think of that?

20:29.147 --> 20:32.292
What do you think?

20:32.330 --> 20:34.824
- Is it legal?
- Totally.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.704
Totally legal.

20:36.780 --> 20:41.461
- Shit. I'm in if you're in, jefe.
- Hey, I'm good.

20:43.532 --> 20:45.987
What about you, Foster?

20:46.065 --> 20:48.864
- Oh, Foster, please! Come on!
- What?

20:48.904 --> 20:52.586
- Come on! It's easy money!
- There's no such thing
as easy money, Squeaky.

20:52.662 --> 20:54.657
I'll take that as a yes, Foster.

20:54.735 --> 20:57.305
Baker, find the ship's generator.
We need power to the bridge.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.719
See if you can get
the main engines running.
Squeaky, you go with him. Richie?

21:00.834 --> 21:03.405
Throw a line down to the tug.
We're gonna have to turn
this ship into the wind.

21:03.481 --> 21:06.128
Foster, can you see if you can get some
of this navigational equipment started?

21:06.204 --> 21:08.430
Captain. My father was an admiral.

21:08.506 --> 21:10.770
I know a little something
about maritime law.

21:10.847 --> 21:12.841
If there's anybody alive on this ship,
you can't claim her.

21:12.918 --> 21:16.026
- Then let's not find anyone alive.
- What does that mean?

21:17.675 --> 21:20.859
Just that. I hope
we don't find anyone alive.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.235
Woods, come back to me.

21:24.274 --> 21:27.879
We're gonna need to turn
the ship into the wind.

21:32.713 --> 21:35.284
It just doesn't add up. You know?

21:35.361 --> 21:39.849
Russian vessel, middle of nowhere,
dead in the water, crew vanished?

21:39.925 --> 21:43.647
- I mean, why would they abandon ship?
- I don't know.

21:43.723 --> 21:45.910
And another thing. Who the hell
do you think we can trust here?

21:45.987 --> 21:48.135
We're talkin' about an awful lot
of goddamn money, right?

21:48.174 --> 21:52.278
Listen, the only two guys
that we can trust is just
you and me, Stevie. That's it.

21:52.355 --> 21:54.734
I wouldn't take a check
from the captain.

21:54.848 --> 21:59.183
Woods is wound up so tight,
you couldn't pull a pin
out of his ass with a tractor.

22:00.335 --> 22:02.637
And Hiko is like-

22:03.711 --> 22:05.897
I don't understand
what the hell Hiko is.

22:10.386 --> 22:13.646
Richie's crazy like a fox, Stevie.

22:13.724 --> 22:16.101
But, you know, I think
he just might be there for us.

22:17.943 --> 22:19.977
And Foster's good.

22:20.053 --> 22:22.892
"Good"?

22:22.931 --> 22:25.232
What do you mean by "good"?

22:25.309 --> 22:27.726
I mean she's solid, on the level.

22:27.841 --> 22:29.950
What'd you think I meant?

22:30.027 --> 22:32.176
Sounds like you think she's hot.

22:32.214 --> 22:34.669
Course I think she's hot. Don't you?

22:40.808 --> 22:42.687
- Right here, Steve. Right here.
- Got it?

22:42.764 --> 22:44.644
Yep.

22:44.682 --> 22:46.830
- Yeah, that's it.

22:46.868 --> 22:48.748
- Aw, shit.
- No go?

22:48.786 --> 22:50.666
- Nope.

22:52.546 --> 22:55.001
- What's wrong with this thing?
- Here's your problem right here.

22:55.116 --> 22:58.991
Looks like somebody trashed
the control panel. Oh, yeah.

22:59.068 --> 23:00.909
These three relays are unplugged.

23:00.986 --> 23:03.633
Let's hustle, Squeak. We got
no power to the rudder in a typhoon,

23:03.710 --> 23:06.281
- we're screwed.
- I'm hustling, all right?

23:08.159 --> 23:10.500
- Okay.

23:14.989 --> 23:16.829
- Go?
- Give it a shot.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.226
- That's more like it.
- Captain?

23:42.302 --> 23:44.375
I'm on my way, Woods.

23:48.748 --> 23:50.590
- What the hell is that?

23:50.666 --> 23:54.732
Good job, Baker.
You lit us up like a pinball machine!

24:07.852 --> 24:10.922
Tell you something.
We're gonna be rich.

24:10.998 --> 24:12.878
You're gonna be a rich man, Hiko!

24:17.941 --> 24:20.129
Captain?

24:25.576 --> 24:27.954
Somebody's running this.

24:28.031 --> 24:30.524
Looks like it's running itself.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.673
Computers don't run themselves.

24:34.937 --> 24:38.197
I don't know much about computers,
but that's an anchor.

24:48.785 --> 24:52.046
Emergency on top deck! Emergency on
top deck! Anchor went down on the tug!

24:58.645 --> 25:01.138
Baker, did you copy that?

25:01.253 --> 25:04.016
We need you up here-
Oh, Jesus.

25:04.092 --> 25:07.890
- Baker, we need you on deck now!
- Already on my way.

25:07.928 --> 25:10.038
- Hey, Squeak, you catch that?
- What the hell happened?

25:10.154 --> 25:12.149
You just sit tight. Any sign of trouble,
you don't be a cowboy.

25:12.225 --> 25:16.176
- I'm not gonna,
but d-don't leave me here for too long.
- Stay on your radio.

25:27.570 --> 25:29.527
Woods!

25:29.642 --> 25:31.636
Tell you what.
I'm gonna go get some help.

25:31.751 --> 25:33.478
Woods!

25:33.555 --> 25:37.045
I can't swim!

25:37.161 --> 25:39.002
Woods!

25:39.079 --> 25:43.529
Get back here, goddamn cocksucker!

25:45.447 --> 25:47.173
Hiko! Hiko!

25:47.251 --> 25:49.091
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone!

25:49.169 --> 25:50.549
Shit.

25:54.424 --> 25:56.303
Steve!

25:58.183 --> 26:00.370
Steve!

26:08.695 --> 26:11.073
I got you.

26:18.631 --> 26:21.853
No, that anchor
didn't just drop by itself. No.

26:21.931 --> 26:24.654
- Somebody else is on this ship.
- I hear that.

26:24.692 --> 26:26.572
- Oh, God.

26:26.610 --> 26:28.759
- I'll be all right.
- Not without stitches, you won't.

26:28.836 --> 26:32.710
- Lift up. Lift up!

26:32.787 --> 26:34.705
What are you lookin' at?

26:34.743 --> 26:36.661
Hey! It could've been me!

26:40.689 --> 26:43.222
Stevie, what's goin' on up there, man?

26:43.337 --> 26:45.293
We lost the tug, Squeak.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.941
- She's gone.
- That sucks.

26:48.055 --> 26:49.974
- How we doin' down there, huh?
- I'm doin' fine.

26:50.050 --> 26:52.582
This whole thing is automated.
It runs by itself.

26:52.658 --> 26:54.500
Negative, negative.
We got somebody else on board.

26:54.577 --> 26:57.530
Repeat. We got somebody else on board.
That's who sank the tug.

26:57.646 --> 27:00.791
Now, I want you to bolt the engine room
door shut. You understand me?

27:00.868 --> 27:03.592
I copy that.
And hurry up, will you?

27:03.669 --> 27:05.856
Listen, I think we should
split up into two groups.

27:05.932 --> 27:08.695
- Root 'em out.
- I agree. I just have to fix his leg.

27:08.733 --> 27:12.109
Hold your horses, mister.
I'm still captain here.

27:12.185 --> 27:15.561
You left this on the bridge.

27:15.638 --> 27:19.896
You were captain of the Sea Star.
She just sank, right?

27:20.011 --> 27:21.968
I'm ranking officer.

27:23.579 --> 27:25.613
Listen to me, Baker.

27:25.689 --> 27:30.599
For $30 million I'm willing to overlook
all that's come between us.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.206
How about you?

27:38.157 --> 27:41.188
- Good man. Richie!
- Yeah.

27:41.302 --> 27:43.566
Take Woods.
Go to the engine room.

27:43.604 --> 27:45.484
- Shit.
- Back up Squeaky.

27:45.561 --> 27:50.855
We're gonna take Hiko, get him to
a sick bay. Gonna get that leg fixed.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.195
- Stay away, Woods.
- Go with him, Woods.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.574
Let me tell you something. You get me
killed, I'm gonna kick your ass.

27:55.612 --> 27:58.604
Now, take my shit.
Let's go.

28:10.036 --> 28:12.645
- Wait up for us, Foster.
- All right.

28:16.443 --> 28:18.323
It'll be down that corridor.

28:23.617 --> 28:27.069
- Where's this go, Richie?

28:27.184 --> 28:30.369
It goes down. Come on.

29:01.596 --> 29:03.552
Hello?

29:17.363 --> 29:20.432
Hello? Listen,
I'm a friend. All right?

29:20.509 --> 29:22.887
I'm Cuban. I'm not American.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.800
Anybody in there?

29:33.628 --> 29:35.969
- Hello?

30:18.629 --> 30:20.508
Weapons locker.

30:20.547 --> 30:23.961
What the hell is this all about?

30:26.800 --> 30:29.370
Bingo.

30:31.710 --> 30:34.933
Put him up here.
Come on, Hiko.

30:34.971 --> 30:36.851
- All right. Tighten that down.

30:36.889 --> 30:39.574
Yeah.

30:46.748 --> 30:50.892
- All right. This is gonna hurt.
- It's all right. Just get on with it.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.487
- You have a high pain threshold.
- Yeah, I usually do it myself.

30:59.677 --> 31:02.055
No, really.

31:02.170 --> 31:05.316
Hey, Hiko.
Some dry clothes.

31:05.393 --> 31:08.654
- Yeah, thanks.
- Oh, man.

31:08.730 --> 31:10.840
All right. Here we go.

31:10.878 --> 31:13.948
Ah, come on, Richie.
Isn't that enough guns? Damn.

31:13.986 --> 31:16.863
Woods, let me tell you three things.
You can never be too rich,

31:16.978 --> 31:19.663
too thin or too well-armed.

31:19.741 --> 31:21.812
- Yeah, let's go.

31:23.001 --> 31:24.842
Oh, man.

31:27.374 --> 31:29.907
Get the green bag.

31:29.983 --> 31:32.746
Green bag? Oh, man.

31:32.822 --> 31:36.428
Goddamn, I'm carrying too much.
I got a bad latissimus, Richie.

31:38.193 --> 31:41.645
I'm tellin' you, Richie. My back
isn't gonna let me do this anymore.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.983
I can't deal with it.
I get hung up on everything.

31:47.093 --> 31:50.392
I'm tellin' you,
I'm gonna get rid of some of this crap.

31:53.538 --> 31:55.917
Hey, Woods,
what do you make of this?

31:55.993 --> 31:58.295
I have no idea.

32:05.162 --> 32:09.151
Tactical short-range
surface-to-air.

32:09.228 --> 32:11.108
This is beautiful, man.

32:11.184 --> 32:13.218
Oh, I'm thrilled.
Can we go now?

32:13.333 --> 32:15.903
- In a minute. Look around, man.
- Damn!

32:21.466 --> 32:23.307
Hello, Mr. Cable.

32:25.187 --> 32:28.064
- Hey, Woods. Look at this.
- What?

32:30.597 --> 32:33.742
It looks like some kind
of ejection seat or escape vehicle.

32:35.813 --> 32:39.151
Oh, launch buttons. Cool.

32:41.069 --> 32:42.987
- Richie.
- Yeah.

32:43.103 --> 32:44.943
Look at these doors, man.

32:51.964 --> 32:54.842
That's an awful lot
of blood, Richie.

32:56.223 --> 32:59.867
- Now can we go?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:01.632 --> 33:03.473
- Oh, Foster.
- Yeah?

33:03.550 --> 33:05.430
What are you gonna do
with your three million?

33:05.506 --> 33:08.460
I don't have it yet.

33:08.575 --> 33:11.108
What about you, Hiko?

33:11.184 --> 33:14.253
Uh, three million?
Probably open a school.

33:14.329 --> 33:16.708
A school? For what?

33:16.823 --> 33:18.972
Uh, Kura Kaupapa.
It would be choice.

33:19.010 --> 33:22.271
- Lots of little kids
reading, writing, learning Maori.
- That's sweet.

33:22.348 --> 33:25.186
Yeah, it's a dream thing.

33:25.263 --> 33:29.445
- How about you, Baker?
- Oh, I don't know.

33:29.521 --> 33:33.780
Always loved the sea.
Probably buy an island.

33:33.856 --> 33:37.079
Oh, yeah?
Does it have a beach?

33:37.156 --> 33:40.800
Beautiful white sand.
Hammock, sailboat.

33:40.876 --> 33:43.255
- What about a house?
- How about a villa?

33:43.331 --> 33:46.631
Thatched roof,
overlooking a lagoon.

33:46.707 --> 33:48.127
It sounds nice.

33:48.166 --> 33:50.237
Yes, lovely.
When you two gettin' married?

33:50.314 --> 33:53.229
- Hey!
- Gee! Take it easy, mate!

33:53.344 --> 33:55.224
No, you take it easy, mate.

34:05.122 --> 34:07.501
Aah! Get off my leg!

34:07.616 --> 34:09.610
Geez!

34:26.911 --> 34:29.176
Is she dead?

34:31.362 --> 34:34.239
- No.

34:39.072 --> 34:41.068
What's this shit, Richie?

34:41.183 --> 34:44.636
Somebody doesn't
Iike electricity, Woodsy.

34:44.712 --> 34:46.592
Come on.

34:46.630 --> 34:50.467
Well, it looks like somebody
tried to rewire the ship.

34:52.768 --> 34:54.610
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

34:54.687 --> 34:58.638
- So that's done.
- What's all this weird stuff
in her bag?

35:00.402 --> 35:03.126
She's got videotapes,
cigarettes. What's this? Hair spray?

35:03.203 --> 35:05.658
Hey, watch out! Watch out, watch out!
Thermite grenades.

35:05.735 --> 35:08.574
- What?
- Thermite.

35:08.612 --> 35:11.988
One of those things blows, burn a hole
right through the deck. Be careful.

35:12.065 --> 35:15.748
- Be careful, really careful.
- What's she trying to do?
Sink the ship?

35:15.786 --> 35:18.548
- Squeaky, talk to me.
- How does it feel?

35:18.625 --> 35:21.042
- It's good. Thanks.
- Are you gonna be able to walk?

35:21.156 --> 35:23.497
Yeah. I-I'll be okay.

35:26.374 --> 35:27.908
Squeak, que pasa, buddy?

35:29.750 --> 35:31.591
Where the hell are you, man?

35:32.551 --> 35:34.392
Shit.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.346
Richie, Woods, come back.

35:37.384 --> 35:39.456
Steve, this ship's got a missile rome.

35:39.533 --> 35:41.413
I don't give a damn about any missiles!

35:41.489 --> 35:44.098
I left Squeaky in the engine room
and he's not answering,
so get the hell down there.

35:44.136 --> 35:48.394
- Yeah, yeah. We hear you.
- We've got a crew member up here
who just unloaded an Uzi on us,

35:48.471 --> 35:50.504
- so you better watch your ass.
- Yeah, copy that.

35:52.116 --> 35:55.530
- I'm goin' to the engine room.
- We'll see you on the bridge.

35:55.645 --> 35:58.522
Steve? Watch your back.

36:16.592 --> 36:19.315
Hey, Woods, you comprehend
this Cyrillic crap?

36:19.391 --> 36:22.998
It's like chicken scratches to me.

36:23.074 --> 36:26.374
Oh! Richie, Richie, help me!

36:34.161 --> 36:36.041
Here, Woods.

36:38.726 --> 36:41.834
Oh!

36:41.910 --> 36:44.136
That thing smells
Iike dog shit, Richie.

36:44.174 --> 36:46.054
Ugh! What is it?

36:46.169 --> 36:49.736
It's robotic, Woodsy.
High-tech robotics.

36:53.649 --> 36:55.989
Where'd you learn how to sew?

36:56.066 --> 36:58.215
- My grandfather.
- Yeah?

37:02.665 --> 37:05.733
It's all right. It's okay.
We're not going to hurt you.

37:05.811 --> 37:09.992
Power. Turn off the power.
Shut down the ship.

37:10.068 --> 37:12.332
- You're all in danger.
- What's she going on about?

37:12.409 --> 37:14.403
I don't know.
I don't know.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.614
Captain, please.

37:24.072 --> 37:25.951
What's your name?

37:30.171 --> 37:32.780
What's happened on this ship?
Where're the rest of your crew?

37:32.856 --> 37:35.849
- Dead.
- Dead?

37:35.925 --> 37:37.767
Good.

37:37.843 --> 37:41.066
You must turn off the power.
It needs power to move through the ship.

37:42.524 --> 37:45.209
What... needs... power?

37:46.513 --> 37:49.352
- It. From the MIR.
- The MIR space station?

37:49.467 --> 37:51.155
- Yes.
- She's a fruitcake.

37:51.232 --> 37:54.416
- Come on, Captain.
- She's a nutter, which is perfect.

37:57.178 --> 37:59.020
Hiko, come on!

38:43.904 --> 38:46.282
- Drop it.

38:48.315 --> 38:50.810
Drop it!

38:56.717 --> 38:59.364
- It's okay.
- You don't understand.

38:59.402 --> 39:02.548
Look. I'm not gonna hurt you.

39:06.500 --> 39:10.298
My name's Kelly Foster.
I'm a navigator.

39:10.412 --> 39:13.251
I'm Nadia.

39:13.290 --> 39:15.821
Nadia Vinogradova,
Chief Science Officer.

39:16.935 --> 39:20.847
Nadia, what happened?
Where's your crew?

39:21.807 --> 39:24.875
I told you.
Dead or deserted.

39:24.914 --> 39:27.638
Three hundred crew members are gone?

39:27.714 --> 39:30.323
What happened?

39:30.400 --> 39:34.120
Eight days ago, during a transmission
from the MIR space station,

39:34.159 --> 39:36.537
something came onto the ship.

39:36.615 --> 39:40.182
We thought our transmitters
and receivers were malfunctioning,
so we shut them down.

39:40.259 --> 39:44.901
lt took control
of computers, scanned all information.

39:44.939 --> 39:48.814
Language, encyclopedias,
medical data. It was learning.

39:48.890 --> 39:51.499
Learning what?

39:51.576 --> 39:53.417
How to kill us.

39:55.297 --> 39:59.249
My captain, Alexi, and me
were the last to survive.

40:00.323 --> 40:02.356
We cut their cables,
smashed them-

40:02.471 --> 40:04.465
Wait a minute.
You just said "them. "

40:04.581 --> 40:08.456
Before you said "it. "
Who's "them"?

40:08.532 --> 40:11.870
Mm. Machine.
Uh, machines.

40:11.947 --> 40:15.974
Machines. Ah.

40:17.739 --> 40:20.578
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I-I know. I-

40:20.655 --> 40:22.611
- Foster?
- Yeah, I'm in here.

40:26.140 --> 40:29.401
It's okay. Nobody's going to hurt you.
It's okay. It's okay.

40:32.739 --> 40:34.581
She's nuts.

40:34.657 --> 40:36.690
But something scared
the hell out of her.

40:38.494 --> 40:40.987
I say we get her
up to the bridge. Hiko.

40:41.102 --> 40:42.637
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me the flashlight.

40:42.752 --> 40:45.322
You're gonna be okay. It's okay.
We're gonna get you something to eat.

40:45.399 --> 40:49.082
Come on. Come on.
Watch your head. It's okay.

40:51.268 --> 40:53.109
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

40:53.186 --> 40:55.373
- Go!
- No!

40:56.984 --> 40:59.861
- You got her? Okay, go.
- I'm not a threat!

41:01.089 --> 41:03.122
I'm not a threat!

41:04.849 --> 41:07.956
I used to go turkey huntin',
you know, with my dad.

41:08.033 --> 41:11.025
- It beats the shit outta this, man.
- Shh.

41:11.141 --> 41:12.982
- You hear that?

41:13.059 --> 41:15.858
lt sounds like
somebody's working down there.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.775
What- uh-

41:23.378 --> 41:24.797
Hey! Anybody in here?

41:24.912 --> 41:27.982
Shh! Quiet, man. Be quiet.

41:29.132 --> 41:32.086
Stay down.
There might be somebody.

41:32.201 --> 41:36.882
- Hey, Woodsy, there's
another one of those things, man.

41:44.592 --> 41:47.086
- Let's go, man!

41:47.202 --> 41:49.042
- Shh.
- I'm outta here.

41:58.710 --> 42:00.590
Richie, Woods,
where the hell are you two?

42:00.628 --> 42:05.308
Hey, Steve, listen. There's
a machine shop down here with, uh,

42:05.385 --> 42:09.758
- state-of-the-art robotics.
- I already told you twice
to get your asses to the engine room!

42:09.874 --> 42:13.902
- You hear me?
- Yeah, yeah.

42:13.978 --> 42:15.858
We're comin'.

42:38.914 --> 42:40.794
Come on, Woodsy.

42:48.658 --> 42:51.037
I'm not-
I'm not comin'.

43:09.835 --> 43:11.791
Hey, little buddy.

43:18.390 --> 43:21.344
- Richie, let's go.
- Hey, hey, Woodsy.
Did the other one bother you?

43:21.458 --> 43:23.377
Huh? No, it didn't.

43:31.701 --> 43:34.578
Richie.

43:34.656 --> 43:36.689
Richie?

43:40.870 --> 43:42.750
- Hey!

43:42.865 --> 43:45.051
Goddamn, Richie!

44:03.658 --> 44:05.422
I'm sick of this!

44:10.294 --> 44:13.824
- Oh, God.
- Steve, this is Richie.
There's another Russian down here.

44:13.900 --> 44:16.739
The son of a bitch shot at us!
And Woods is hurt.

44:16.816 --> 44:18.926
- So watch your ass. You copy?
- Copy that. How is he?

44:18.964 --> 44:22.456
- Just tell him it's bad. Ow!

44:22.532 --> 44:25.639
- Bad!
- He'll live,
but he ain't in a good mood, man.

44:25.716 --> 44:28.938
Just get him to the damn engine room.
And no more sightseeing, all right?

44:29.015 --> 44:31.202
Yeah. Copy, copy, copy.
All right.

44:31.279 --> 44:33.734
- Get up. Get up.

44:40.064 --> 44:43.248
Squeaky? Squeak?

44:45.051 --> 44:49.386
Holy shit. What the hell?

44:49.463 --> 44:51.534
Oh, my God.

44:51.572 --> 44:54.335
Jesus Christ! Squeak?

44:55.485 --> 44:58.938
Squeak? Open up!

45:01.125 --> 45:04.117
- Don't shoot! It's us!
- Where the hell have you two been?

45:04.194 --> 45:06.035
Back from your holiday?

45:07.608 --> 45:12.327
- Jesus Christ. Woods, you're a mess.
- Thank you.

45:12.403 --> 45:16.585
-You said a Russian did this?
-No, a machine did that with a nail gun.

45:16.662 --> 45:19.577
Yeah, that's right. You're not
gonna believe it till you see it.

45:19.615 --> 45:21.879
There's some really weird shit
goin' down on this ship, man.

45:21.917 --> 45:24.718
- Weird ain't the word.
- I'm in need of some
proper medical attention.

45:24.756 --> 45:27.979
- Shut the fuck up!
- I don't belong on this ship.

45:28.056 --> 45:30.587
- Somebody just welded
the engine room door shut.
- It's welded?

45:30.664 --> 45:33.081
- Squeaky's still missing.
- Weird.

45:33.157 --> 45:35.574
R-Richie?

45:35.613 --> 45:39.871
Richie, it's that smell again.

45:45.818 --> 45:47.352
- Squeak?
- Hey, Squeaky!

45:47.390 --> 45:50.037
- Squeak, man.
- Is that you?

45:51.227 --> 45:53.336
Shit!

45:59.628 --> 46:03.158
- Go!
- That bastard shot at us!

46:10.370 --> 46:13.822
You're all going to die.

46:13.899 --> 46:15.970
You hear that, Foster?

46:16.047 --> 46:19.730
We're all going to die,
because there are aliens on this ship.

46:19.768 --> 46:22.300
That's all the grounds I need.

46:24.296 --> 46:28.438
One of my men is missing.
And I want some answers!

46:28.477 --> 46:31.430
And no more
of this Twilight Zone stuff.

46:33.234 --> 46:35.190
I don't know anything
about your man.

46:35.267 --> 46:39.487
Rubbish.
I'm gonna give you five seconds,

46:39.564 --> 46:41.405
and then I'm gonna
blow your brains out.

46:41.482 --> 46:44.743
- One-
- She couldn't possibly know
where Squeaky is.

46:44.819 --> 46:49.845
- She was hiding in sick bay.
- She knows. She dropped
an anchor on my tug.

46:49.884 --> 46:51.764
She fired at us. Two.

46:51.802 --> 46:53.950
Captain!
Hiko, come on!

46:54.026 --> 46:57.326
- That anchor nearly killed me.
I'm not feeling too sympathetic.
- Me neither.

46:57.402 --> 47:01.584
- Three.
- Shoot me. I don't care.
Just shut down the power to the ship.

47:06.072 --> 47:08.835
Captain, she's not gonna
tell you what you wanna hear.

47:08.988 --> 47:12.440
Hey, Captain. I'd like to hear
what she has to say about this.

47:12.518 --> 47:15.126
Up here on the chart table, Richie.

47:17.121 --> 47:19.077
Fake bastard!

47:20.113 --> 47:21.954
What the bloody hell is that?

47:22.031 --> 47:24.180
It beats the hell out of us.

47:25.177 --> 47:27.134
It's Alexi, my captain.

47:27.210 --> 47:30.510
Hell, whatever it is,
it tried to kill us.

47:34.653 --> 47:37.760
Squeaky's still AWOL, and somebody
welded the engine room door shut.

47:37.837 --> 47:40.215
We're not alone here.

47:40.253 --> 47:42.133
She's got another friend down there.

47:42.172 --> 47:44.205
Can someone explain
what the hell is goin' on?

47:46.967 --> 47:49.653
Finish your story, Nadia.

47:52.414 --> 47:54.448
The energy that came
from the MIR...

47:54.525 --> 47:58.284
infested all of the ship's
electrical systems.

47:58.361 --> 48:01.277
Mainframe computer,
the labs, the machine shops.

48:01.353 --> 48:04.920
It activated fire extinguishers.

48:04.997 --> 48:07.261
Sixty-seven died
from halon gas poisoning.

48:07.299 --> 48:09.486
Quarter of the crew.

48:09.563 --> 48:14.243
It cut us off from machine shops
and started building.

48:14.320 --> 48:17.350
The little ones first-
the gatherers.

48:17.427 --> 48:20.227
Yeah. We saw a whole room full of them.
That's what nailed Woods.

48:22.299 --> 48:25.407
Then came something...
more dangerous.

48:26.788 --> 48:29.933
Half man, half machine.

48:30.010 --> 48:33.309
A biomechanism. Engineering
beyond our comprehensions.

48:33.386 --> 48:38.412
The rest of the crew deserted,
taking their chances in the sea.

48:38.488 --> 48:41.788
Only Alexi and me stayed,
cutting cables.

48:41.826 --> 48:44.472
What does cutting cables
have to do with it?

48:46.967 --> 48:50.265
The machines are controlled by
the electrical energy in the computer.

48:50.343 --> 48:53.948
If we can cut their source
of power, they'll die.

48:53.987 --> 48:57.286
We cut these to get him here.
What the hell are you talking about?

48:57.363 --> 49:01.275
What is this thing that's
inside the computer, huh?

49:01.314 --> 49:04.000
It's a life-form
unlike anything we know.

49:04.038 --> 49:07.261
Not cellular but electrical in nature.
Extremely intelligent.

49:07.337 --> 49:09.408
You mean it's like
Iightning that can think.

49:09.485 --> 49:12.133
It has no form, no shape,
but it's giving itself what it lacks.

49:13.475 --> 49:15.354
It's creating
a new life-form...

49:15.394 --> 49:17.350
using parts of the ship and crew.

49:19.920 --> 49:22.030
Blood is still pumping
through this brain.

49:22.106 --> 49:23.948
There's been
no decomposition at all.

49:27.938 --> 49:31.160
Yeah. Here, right here.
See? There's...

49:31.198 --> 49:34.843
some kind of coil or self-contained
power supply built right into it.

49:34.920 --> 49:36.953
Amazing.

49:36.991 --> 49:40.521
- This brain is still alive.

49:40.598 --> 49:43.859
- Hello?

49:43.935 --> 49:47.119
Stop fucking around
with the damn thing, Richie!

49:47.196 --> 49:49.037
I'm just looking at it, Steve.

50:02.426 --> 50:04.382
Alexi?

50:15.968 --> 50:20.035
Touch it again,
I'll cut your hands off.

50:20.073 --> 50:22.144
I can respect that.

50:25.444 --> 50:28.474
It's still Alexi.
It's Alexi.

50:28.512 --> 50:32.656
Rubbish! You're listening
to a pile of Russian rubbish.

50:32.732 --> 50:36.991
And I for one won't listen
to any more of it. There's no alien.

50:37.067 --> 50:38.986
Something their government cooked up.

50:39.062 --> 50:43.550
It all went wrong, didn't it?
You're afraid the rest of the world's
gonna find out about it.

50:43.590 --> 50:47.233
Dr. Igor Fuckin' Frankenstein there.

50:51.415 --> 50:55.481
Alexi was no medical experiment.

50:55.520 --> 50:58.896
- He was my husband.
- Rubbish.

50:59.011 --> 51:03.192
Could someone please come and take
a look at the nails in my shoulder?

51:03.231 --> 51:06.990
Woods, stop whining!

51:07.067 --> 51:10.251
Ow! God! Ow!

51:18.461 --> 51:21.223
Oh, my God. Captain!

51:25.251 --> 51:27.859
Brace yourselves!

51:45.929 --> 51:47.885
We gotta turn her into the wind!

51:52.834 --> 51:54.330
The steering doesn't answer.

51:58.282 --> 52:00.238
We could steer the ship
from the engine room.

52:00.353 --> 52:02.923
-I thought you said the door was welded.
-We'll cut the damn door.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.568
Right. Bring her.
I wanna keep her in my sight.

52:21.069 --> 52:23.409
I gotta get off this ship.

52:39.714 --> 52:42.552
- All clear?
- Clear.

52:45.506 --> 52:48.652
- Did you feel that?

52:54.905 --> 52:57.436
The ship's turning.

52:59.892 --> 53:03.191
We just turned 20 degrees into the wind.
The ship's steering itself.

53:03.267 --> 53:08.101
- Ships don't steer themselves.
- She's altered her course.

53:10.097 --> 53:14.776
- Let's go. Come on.
- Engine room's one deck down.

53:14.853 --> 53:17.539
- What the hell was that?

53:17.615 --> 53:19.917
- Could be Squeak.
- I don't care who it is!

53:19.994 --> 53:22.104
I said it could be Squeak!

53:23.102 --> 53:25.479
Steve.

53:25.519 --> 53:27.359
Jesus Christ.

53:32.615 --> 53:35.876
- Careful, Richie.
- Yeah.

53:35.953 --> 53:38.868
It's too weird, man.
You can't open that door.

53:38.983 --> 53:41.707
- What is it, Steve?
- I don't know. What you got, Richie?

53:41.784 --> 53:45.966
- I don't know. It could be Squeaky.
- Let me see. Let me see!

53:46.042 --> 53:48.881
What the hell is that?

53:48.996 --> 53:53.254
- Open the door!
- Steve!
- Don't open the damn door!

54:04.112 --> 54:06.758
Squeak?

54:06.796 --> 54:09.137
Steve.

54:12.704 --> 54:15.620
- Steve!

54:17.308 --> 54:21.950
Richie! God, Richie, help me,
for God's sake! Richie!

54:23.446 --> 54:25.863
Shit!

54:29.699 --> 54:32.615
Richie!

54:36.604 --> 54:38.599
Steve!

54:38.676 --> 54:41.438
- Out this side!
- Go! Go! Go!

54:41.476 --> 54:43.433
- Come on. This way!
- Steve.

54:43.548 --> 54:45.427
Come on!

54:49.993 --> 54:52.179
- Where are we?
- Communications room.

54:52.257 --> 54:55.633
- Good! I'm callin' for help.

54:55.748 --> 54:59.430
- Did you trash this?
- We destroyed every transmitter
on the ship.

55:10.786 --> 55:13.701
- You didn't smash this one.
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
- Don't!

55:13.816 --> 55:18.151
What the hell is wrong with you?
Are you out of your fuckin' mind?

55:18.267 --> 55:22.870
No one else is gonna claim salvage
on this vessel but us.

55:25.325 --> 55:27.320
You're no longer in charge.

55:31.962 --> 55:33.918
- Come here!

55:48.190 --> 55:51.028
- What do they want from us?
- It wants to kill us.

55:51.143 --> 55:54.826
- No, they want something.
- It wants to mutilate us
just like it did Woods.

55:54.903 --> 55:58.279
Did you see Squeaky?
That thing wants something from us.

55:58.432 --> 56:01.923
Why don't we talk to it? It's in
the computer. We could talk to it.

56:01.961 --> 56:05.414
- What?
- Talk to it! It's in the computer.

56:05.452 --> 56:09.672
What the hell?
What do I do? What do I do?

56:09.749 --> 56:11.974
Nadia, please help me.
I need English, please.

56:16.693 --> 56:19.301
"Who are you?"

56:21.987 --> 56:25.018
I am aware.

56:26.514 --> 56:29.966
Is that it? Is it?
Is it the thing?

56:30.043 --> 56:32.614
"We mean you no harm. "

56:32.652 --> 56:36.872
Life-form analysis complete.
Species is destructive,

56:36.949 --> 56:41.513
invasive, noxious,
harmful to the body of the whole.

56:41.552 --> 56:43.431
- "What species?"
- Man.

56:47.498 --> 56:49.570
You are virus.

56:49.608 --> 56:52.409
Great. Just great.

56:52.485 --> 56:55.477
It thinks we're germs.

56:55.554 --> 56:58.355
"What do you want from us?"

56:58.431 --> 57:01.807
Viscous neurological transmitters,

57:01.885 --> 57:05.567
oxygenated tissues,
Aponeurus Superiorus Papelbrai.

57:05.643 --> 57:07.754
"Superior-"
What the hell is that?

57:07.830 --> 57:10.477
- It's part of an optic nerve.
- What?

57:10.555 --> 57:13.585
- Spare parts.

57:13.662 --> 57:15.656
It wants us for spare parts.

57:24.211 --> 57:26.130
- It must be destroyed.
- How?

57:26.206 --> 57:28.048
- You said it was electrical,
Iike lightning.
- Yes.

57:28.124 --> 57:30.234
- What happens when
Iightning hits water?
- It grounds out!

57:30.311 --> 57:34.147
That's right. It grounds out,
dissipates and dies.
That means we can kill this thing.

57:34.186 --> 57:37.408
- We have to sink the ship to do that.
- It's in the computer.

57:37.484 --> 57:39.979
- Where's the mainframe?
- D deck. One deck below.

57:40.055 --> 57:42.933
She's right. We gotta get to the
computer if we're gonna kill this thing.

57:44.045 --> 57:45.925
We gotta get
the hell outta here first.

57:45.963 --> 57:49.492
You people want a way out of here?
Huh? I'll show you a way outta here.

57:52.331 --> 57:55.093
- Steve.

57:59.006 --> 58:02.881
Spare parts, my ass, man.
That ain't gonna happen to me.

58:02.957 --> 58:06.218
I ain't goin' up against those things,
man. You people can do what you want.

58:06.257 --> 58:08.137
- I'm outta here.
- Get down!

58:09.403 --> 58:14.198
- You're crazy!

58:14.275 --> 58:17.229
Who's gonna carry my shit?
Who's gonna carry my shit?

58:20.221 --> 58:23.597
- He's gone postal, man.
- Come on. Let's go!

58:23.673 --> 58:26.397
Steve.

58:28.967 --> 58:32.574
- You coming?
- You hit a superior officer, Foster.

58:34.032 --> 58:36.563
You punched me!
You're crazy!

58:36.640 --> 58:39.901
- Fuck you!
- You're all gonna
get yourselves killed!

59:15.348 --> 59:18.033
- Wanna talk to me, do ya?

59:27.509 --> 59:30.194
I knew you did.

59:33.033 --> 59:35.987
"Everton...

59:36.064 --> 59:39.823
is the dominant life-form.

59:39.862 --> 59:44.542
I am Everton. "

59:52.444 --> 59:55.591
"I will help you...

59:55.629 --> 59:58.544
bring this ship to port.

59:58.583 --> 01:00:01.422
New Zealand,

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:03.378
Australia,

01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:06.064
anywhere you want. "

01:00:10.974 --> 01:00:12.816
"Workroom 14. "

01:00:23.672 --> 01:00:26.012
It's not gettin' me.

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:35.756
My brain is not becoming
some hard drive...

01:00:35.794 --> 01:00:39.401
for some biomechanoid, alien mother-

01:00:58.084 --> 01:01:03.186
Oh, I can use this.
This is a good part.

01:01:17.763 --> 01:01:20.487
That door down there leads
to the main computer room.

01:01:21.907 --> 01:01:25.283
I thought you said this was
gonna be well protected.

01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:27.201
Hiko.

01:01:37.367 --> 01:01:39.745
- lt's gone.
- Gone where?

01:01:48.569 --> 01:01:51.254
Fuckin' thing moved itself.

01:02:27.008 --> 01:02:30.461
Robert Everton, Captain, the Sea Star.

01:02:33.798 --> 01:02:35.640
Thank you.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.264
Th-They're planning to sink the ship.

01:03:33.683 --> 01:03:36.177
Of course, you know that, don't you?

01:03:46.803 --> 01:03:50.678
It's pretty amazing,
what with no head and all.

01:03:58.849 --> 01:04:00.729
Woods.

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:04.642
Twenty-five years,
him and me-

01:04:05.754 --> 01:04:08.133
together.

01:04:10.741 --> 01:04:13.197
Are you Everton?

01:04:15.421 --> 01:04:18.990
Are you the dominant life-form?

01:04:20.562 --> 01:04:22.634
How can I be of assistance to you?

01:04:23.862 --> 01:04:26.854
Help me to survive.

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:34.833
It's welded.
We just came through here.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.789
We've been set up.

01:04:36.828 --> 01:04:38.707
- This way.
- Let's go!

01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:43.657
Six years in the navy
as a weapons specialist.

01:04:43.733 --> 01:04:46.188
I graduated top of my class.

01:04:46.265 --> 01:04:49.756
I'm gettin' out. I got a plan.

01:04:49.833 --> 01:04:52.902
It thinks it's smarter than me?
It's gonna get a surprise.

01:04:56.662 --> 01:04:59.616
- Where we going?
- The storage room.
We can get out through here.

01:05:02.646 --> 01:05:07.173
- Ow! It's welded.
What's down there? Nadia!
- Dead end.

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:10.089
Steve, I need something
to pry this. Hurry!

01:05:24.474 --> 01:05:27.275
- Steve!

01:05:27.351 --> 01:05:31.380
Hiko! Steve, over here!

01:05:31.418 --> 01:05:33.720
- Hiko!

01:05:35.408 --> 01:05:37.134
- Hiko!

01:05:37.211 --> 01:05:40.434
- Hiko, come on! Move!
- Hiko!

01:05:43.925 --> 01:05:47.684
Let's go, go, go, go!

01:05:59.385 --> 01:06:01.226
Nadia, which way?

01:06:01.303 --> 01:06:04.985
- The antenna control room.
We'll be safe there.
- Okay. Steve!

01:06:05.024 --> 01:06:08.170
Right behind you!
Go! Just keep moving!

01:06:21.021 --> 01:06:23.131
You stay close, Foster.

01:06:40.203 --> 01:06:43.195
Keep going, Hiko! Keep going!

01:06:53.361 --> 01:06:55.625
Hiko!

01:06:55.701 --> 01:06:59.116
Help me, Hiko!

01:06:59.192 --> 01:07:02.377
- Foster, hang on!
- Hiko!

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:08.130
Come on, come on!
Take my hand! Come on!

01:07:10.048 --> 01:07:12.734
I got ya!

01:07:12.772 --> 01:07:14.652
Come on!

01:07:15.841 --> 01:07:18.181
Steve!

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:28.309
- Hiko!

01:07:38.553 --> 01:07:43.041
- Hiko!
- Foster, come on!

01:07:43.079 --> 01:07:45.419
He's gone. Keep moving!

01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:07.286
Maybe he made it
to another part of the ship.

01:08:08.283 --> 01:08:09.473
Not a chance.

01:08:09.473 --> 01:08:10.394
Not a chance.

01:08:43.232 --> 01:08:45.533
Just a little good-bye gift.

01:08:51.095 --> 01:08:54.242
We gotta find out
where it's taking us. Steve!

01:08:55.777 --> 01:08:57.848
Give me a hand.

01:09:03.716 --> 01:09:05.596
We need a light.

01:09:09.932 --> 01:09:12.425
We're headed here on this vector.

01:09:12.502 --> 01:09:15.188
North-northwest.
Lord Howe lsland?

01:09:15.264 --> 01:09:19.983
- Lord Howe? Why?
There's nothin' there.
- There is.

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:23.167
There is a British intelligence station
there. They have digital linkups...

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:25.546
to all the military and commercial
satellites in the Southern Hemisphere.

01:09:25.622 --> 01:09:29.536
If it gets into the transoceanic
Pacific cable, it could go anywhere.

01:09:29.573 --> 01:09:33.372
This is the vessel Norfolk to
the vessel at 29 south, 79 east.

01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:37.591
Received a mayday at 0800 hours.
We have you on radar.

01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:39.549
Richie's mayday got through!

01:09:39.587 --> 01:09:43.423
If you are receiving
but cannot transmit,
please respond by signal flare.

01:09:43.537 --> 01:09:46.837
- We need a flare gun!
- No, no! If anything,
we need to warn them away.

01:09:46.913 --> 01:09:50.175
- Why?
- Because this thing is
isolated on the ship, Steve.

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:52.783
- We can't let another ship near us.
- Right.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.410
We gotta sink this ship.

01:10:03.525 --> 01:10:05.635
How?

01:10:08.129 --> 01:10:10.814
Flood the hold with fuel
and detonate it.

01:10:12.847 --> 01:10:14.689
Let's do it.

01:10:32.029 --> 01:10:33.908
Jesus Christ.

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:38.128
Foster, get back!

01:10:50.405 --> 01:10:54.969
You don't recognize me.
What's wrong?

01:11:09.202 --> 01:11:13.844
I'm still your captain, Foster.
You must treat me with respect.

01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:26.619
We know where you're going.

01:11:26.695 --> 01:11:28.767
I know you do.

01:11:28.805 --> 01:11:31.990
There's a whole world
waiting out there.

01:11:36.325 --> 01:11:38.971
Steve! Foster! Grenade!

01:11:43.498 --> 01:11:45.724
Get down!

01:12:14.534 --> 01:12:18.639
Through your captain, it knows what
we are planning. We must hurry. Come on.

01:12:44.188 --> 01:12:46.030
Come on.

01:12:51.439 --> 01:12:55.927
- Good. Okay.
- So, which way?

01:12:59.112 --> 01:13:01.374
Oh, God! Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of me!

01:13:02.986 --> 01:13:05.134
- Put the gun down.
- Richie, man, it's us!

01:13:05.211 --> 01:13:07.973
- How do I know that?
- Put it down, Mason.

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.850
We're gonna blow the ship.
You come with us, all right?

01:13:10.888 --> 01:13:13.766
I got my own plan.

01:13:13.842 --> 01:13:15.760
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:13:16.874 --> 01:13:20.134
Richie, don't be a fool! Richie!

01:13:20.211 --> 01:13:22.896
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:13:46.796 --> 01:13:50.058
- That should do it.

01:14:03.254 --> 01:14:05.134
Checkmate.

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:07.397
I gave us 15 minutes.

01:14:07.436 --> 01:14:09.469
- Let's go.
- We should warn Richie.

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:12.806
Richie, Richie, if you can hear me,
we're leaving the ship.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.530
- Richie!

01:16:15.682 --> 01:16:20.400
[ Mechanical Whirring,
Electronic Beeping ]

01:16:43.687 --> 01:16:46.104
English.

01:16:47.677 --> 01:16:50.592
- Do you speak English?
- Fuck you.

01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:55.119
- English. Where is the detonator?
- I don't remember.

01:16:55.196 --> 01:16:59.262
- The detonator-

01:16:59.339 --> 01:17:01.986
where is it?

01:17:42.152 --> 01:17:43.993
Cut her down.

01:17:55.502 --> 01:17:59.952
- Steve, buddy, you okay?
Huh? I got ya.

01:18:03.559 --> 01:18:06.512
- We gotta go. We gotta go.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.221
Steve! Richie!

01:18:19.248 --> 01:18:23.085
Come on, Foster.

01:18:23.123 --> 01:18:27.151
- Richie!
- Foster, this way, this way.

01:18:50.898 --> 01:18:52.740
It's not coming.

01:19:03.288 --> 01:19:06.435
Foster, Foster, look.

01:19:06.511 --> 01:19:09.312
Survival suits.
Maybe we have a chance.

01:19:09.427 --> 01:19:11.460
Put it on. Put it on.

01:19:16.255 --> 01:19:18.097
Richie!

01:19:33.404 --> 01:19:35.437
Oh, my God.

01:19:35.475 --> 01:19:38.008
Richie?

01:19:38.084 --> 01:19:40.117
Oh, man.

01:19:41.115 --> 01:19:44.107
We thought
you bailed on us, bro.

01:19:44.145 --> 01:19:46.677
We thought
you weren't comin' back.

01:19:46.754 --> 01:19:48.595
Shows you how smart I am.

01:19:52.624 --> 01:19:58.109
Hey, Steve. Now, there's still
a way to get off this ship.

01:19:58.186 --> 01:20:01.523
- What?
- But you gotta get to the missile room.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.741
- Missile room?
- You'll understand when you get there.

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:10.270
Steve-

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:17.713
Mason! Mason? Shit.

01:20:38.889 --> 01:20:41.919
Nadia, stop! Nadia!

01:20:43.454 --> 01:20:46.638
- There's no time!
- I'm not leaving,
not until I know it's dead.

01:20:46.676 --> 01:20:49.515
- The ship's gonna blow any second.
- I've got to make sure.

01:20:49.592 --> 01:20:51.741
- Nadia, it's suicide!
- I don't care!

01:20:51.817 --> 01:20:53.658
- Nadia!

01:21:05.398 --> 01:21:07.201
Checkmate.

01:21:09.924 --> 01:21:13.607
Foster. Foster,
get to the upper deck.

01:21:13.684 --> 01:21:16.714
Get off the ship. You have
to tell people what has happened here.

01:21:16.791 --> 01:21:19.860
- No. No.
- Yes, go. Go!

01:21:30.372 --> 01:21:33.863
Are there more of those devices
aboard this ship?

01:21:36.011 --> 01:21:38.006
Just one more.

01:21:39.157 --> 01:21:41.765
No!

01:22:29.719 --> 01:22:31.790
No!

01:22:31.867 --> 01:22:34.169
It's me, Baker. It's me!

01:22:34.207 --> 01:22:37.660
- It's okay.

01:22:41.841 --> 01:22:43.721
- Come on. We're gonna get outta here.
- No, I can't.

01:22:43.798 --> 01:22:47.558
I don't wanna hear it! You don't have
a choice! Get the hell up! Let's go!

01:22:54.117 --> 01:22:56.496
Come on!

01:23:04.936 --> 01:23:08.619
- Where are we?
- The missile bay. Check that door.

01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:14.258
It's blocked.

01:23:14.296 --> 01:23:18.401
Foster, look at this!
It's a rocket motor!

01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:32.096
Looks like some sort of ejection seat.

01:23:38.005 --> 01:23:41.035
- Come on. Let's go! Get in!
- No. No!

01:23:41.112 --> 01:23:43.567
- No, I'm not going without you!
- Just get in!

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:45.485
- No!
- There's no time!

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:49.782
Richie rigged this for one, okay?

01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:51.700
And you're it.

01:24:06.547 --> 01:24:09.692
Let's go!
Come on, come on, come on, damn it!

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:20.242
- Foster, go!
- Not without you.

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:27.300
That's one hell of a flare.

01:26:23.041 --> 01:26:24.806
Hiko!

01:26:35.624 --> 01:26:39.038
- Foster, it's all right.

01:26:39.115 --> 01:26:43.450
It's okay, you hear me?
We made it.

01:26:43.488 --> 01:26:45.368
Come on.
