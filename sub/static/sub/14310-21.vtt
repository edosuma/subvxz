[theme music]

00:05.120 --> 00:08.140
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.160 --> 00:12.109
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.130 --> 00:15.009
They called themselves Smurfs.

00:15.029 --> 00:16.190
They were good.

00:18.079 --> 00:20.039
[instrumental music]

00:22.109 --> 00:26.100
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.230
He was bad.

00:28.010 --> 00:30.109
Oh, I hate smurfs.

00:31.129 --> 00:32.229
I'll get you.

00:33.009 --> 00:36.070
I'll get all of you, if
it's the last thing I ever do!

00:36.090 --> 00:38.090
[Gargamel laughing]

00:38.109 --> 00:39.159
[Gargamel grunts]

00:39.179 --> 00:41.109
Oh, I'll get you.

00:41.130 --> 00:44.210
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:44.229 --> 00:47.060
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there

00:47.079 --> 00:51.140
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.159 --> 00:54.070
And if you are good,
you may just catch

00:54.090 --> 00:56.159
a glimpse of the Smurfs.

00:59.210 --> 01:02.020
[instrumental music]

(Hogatha)
'Nobody outwits
Hogatha the witch'

01:08.090 --> 01:09.189
'and gets away with it.'

01:09.210 --> 01:13.019
'And that includes
those horrid little smurfs.'

01:13.039 --> 01:17.060
They made a fool of me.
They destroyed my magic locket.

01:17.079 --> 01:20.000
They even robbed me
of one of my nine lives.

01:20.019 --> 01:21.090
But luckily..

01:21.109 --> 01:23.069
[laughs]

01:23.090 --> 01:26.099
...I have eight more
in which to get my revenge.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.129
Now, where was I? Oh, yes.

01:30.099 --> 01:32.000
Blast of bat breath.

01:32.020 --> 01:34.039
[coughing]

01:34.060 --> 01:37.200
A dash of toad spit, and voila.

01:37.219 --> 01:40.219
[sniffs]
It's ready.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.109
[sniffs]
Yuck!

01:43.129 --> 01:45.150
[squawking]

01:45.170 --> 01:50.099
Here's to the smurfs
and their downfall.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.009
[burps]

01:52.030 --> 01:55.150

[screams]

01:58.150 --> 02:00.069
[explosion]

02:04.150 --> 02:08.060
I-I did it. I'm a smurf.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.020
Whoopie!

02:10.038 --> 02:14.039
Oh, it's a perfect
transformation.

02:14.060 --> 02:18.050
[gasps]
Except I..
I-I haven't got a tail.

02:18.069 --> 02:20.129
Drat. I'll just have
to make one.

02:20.150 --> 02:24.060
[grunts]
Oh, my. Oh..

02:24.079 --> 02:28.210
This isn't going to be easy.

02:28.229 --> 02:30.020
[panting]

02:31.199 --> 02:36.030
This pea should do for starters.
I'll just add a splash of color.

02:36.050 --> 02:40.129
There. Now a spot of glue.

02:40.150 --> 02:44.030
And presto.
At last, I'm perfect.

02:46.189 --> 02:52.009
Now all I have to do
is find one smurf. But where?

02:52.030 --> 02:54.139
Of course. A sarsaparilla field.

02:54.159 --> 02:57.120
It's a disgustingly
sweet-smelling place.

02:57.139 --> 03:00.199
Sure to attract
disgustingly sweet smurfs.

03:00.219 --> 03:04.020
[laughs]

03:04.039 --> 03:06.139
[Vanity humming]

03:06.159 --> 03:11.120
[sighs]
A smurf of beauty
is a joy forever.

03:11.139 --> 03:14.020
Oh, brother.

03:14.039 --> 03:17.090
- Hello, fellow smurf.
- Oh, hi.

03:17.110 --> 03:23.000
- Have some sarsaparilla leaf.
- Oh, uh, yes, sure.

03:23.020 --> 03:25.020
[gags]
This is terrible.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.199
Uh, terribly good, that is.

03:27.219 --> 03:29.189
[coughing]

03:29.210 --> 03:33.009
Say, didn't you love smurfing
with Papa Smurf

03:33.030 --> 03:34.159
at the smurf yester-smurf?

03:34.180 --> 03:38.180
Huh? Oh, uh, yes,
of course I did.

03:38.199 --> 03:40.229
What in the world
is he talking about?

03:41.009 --> 03:43.090
Well, we'd better smurf back
to the village.

03:43.110 --> 03:48.020
The village?
Oh, now we're getting somewhere.

03:48.039 --> 03:50.020
[snorts]

03:50.039 --> 03:52.110
Places, everybody. Places.

03:52.129 --> 03:55.210
Oh, boy. It's time
to celebrate the Smurfs' smurf.

03:55.229 --> 03:59.079
And time for me
to celebrate my revenge.

03:59.099 --> 04:00.219
[laughs]

04:01.000 --> 04:04.060
You there, smurf.
Where are you going?

04:04.080 --> 04:07.150
Oh, uh, I was just, uh..

04:07.169 --> 04:10.199
Get back in line. The
celebration is about to start.

04:10.219 --> 04:13.110
Alright, smurfs. Hit it.

04:15.139 --> 04:16.199
Uh..

04:16.220 --> 04:19.050
[Hogatha sings nervously]

04:19.220 --> 04:21.180
Whoops!

04:21.199 --> 04:23.180
[Hogatha stammering]

04:25.100 --> 04:28.050
[instrumental music]

04:28.069 --> 04:30.079
Oh, sorry.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.069
[laughs]

04:32.090 --> 04:36.170
Hold it. You were snorting
instead of smurfing.

04:36.189 --> 04:39.189
Oh, uh, was I?

04:39.209 --> 04:41.040
[snorts]

04:41.060 --> 04:43.180
[all laughing]

04:43.199 --> 04:45.220
You'd better go elsewhere,
Snorty Smurf

04:46.000 --> 04:48.040
until you learn
to stop causing trouble.

04:48.060 --> 04:51.209
Stop causing trouble?
But I've only just begun.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.029
[laughs]

04:53.050 --> 04:54.100
[snorts]

04:56.050 --> 04:57.180
Aha!

05:02.019 --> 05:03.129
[sniffs]

05:03.149 --> 05:06.050
Mmm. Not bad.

05:06.069 --> 05:07.189
A little poison root-rot

05:07.209 --> 05:11.120
should spice things up
considerably.

05:11.139 --> 05:13.069
[laughs]

05:13.089 --> 05:14.129
[bell ringing]

05:14.149 --> 05:16.170
Soup's on. Come and get it.

05:16.189 --> 05:19.100
- Boy, I'm starving.
- Sure am hungry.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.100
I hate hungry.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.170
[all murmuring]

05:23.189 --> 05:25.220
Eat hearty, smurfs.

05:32.029 --> 05:33.209
Aren't you having any, Snorty?

05:34.000 --> 05:38.149
Oh, uh, no, thanks.
I'm not very hungry.

05:38.170 --> 05:41.060
Must be slow-working poison.

05:41.079 --> 05:44.040
Uh, you sure you're all
feeling okay?

05:44.060 --> 05:46.220
- Sure. Oh, yeah.
- Never better.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.060
But frankly, Snorty Smurf,
we're worried about you.

05:50.079 --> 05:53.120
- You're so jittery.
- And you're not eating.

05:53.139 --> 05:57.019
- Now, open wide.
- No, uh, please.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.220
[snorts]
I'm on a low-poison diet.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.199
Ooh, I mean, uh..

06:01.220 --> 06:04.139
I think I just need
a breath of stale air.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.220
[laughs]

06:07.000 --> 06:09.120
I must find out what went wrong.

'Dirty laundry?'

06:18.009 --> 06:20.139
[groaning]

06:20.160 --> 06:25.189
What a washout. Oh, but I'll
get them yet. I will. I will.

06:30.139 --> 06:34.090
How could I make this
a bridge over troubled waters?

06:34.110 --> 06:35.149
[snorts]

06:35.170 --> 06:39.009
Snorty Smurf,
I got a surprise for you.

06:39.029 --> 06:42.180
For me?
Oh, you shouldn't have.

06:42.199 --> 06:44.040

06:44.060 --> 06:46.079
[laughs]

06:46.100 --> 06:53.009
Why, you little smurf aleck.
I'm going to.. Wait.

a brilliant idea.

to your hard smurf'

to smurf this smurf of art'

07:23.040 --> 07:26.120
'which will finally allow us
to smurf to the other side.'

07:26.139 --> 07:30.180
If I never hear the word "Smurf"
again, it will be too soon.

07:30.199 --> 07:35.019
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

my sabotage.

Hey, Snorty,
what are you doing over there?

Hmm.

Smurfs,
I have some shocking news.

Phew. It, uh, wasn't me.

09:31.179 --> 09:34.149
Oh, Papa Smurf.
Is this your tail?

Tail? Name of a smurf.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.090

little things I said.

I-I-I just wanted
to be one of you.

No!

and chalky-chip cookies?

Aw, gee, maybe we should.

Then again,
maybe we shouldn't.

Alright, Hogatha.
This is the end of the line.

12:18.059 --> 12:20.129
Oh, no, please.

12:20.149 --> 12:22.230
You'll never hear my snort
in the village again.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.129
[snorts]
I...promise.

12:25.149 --> 12:28.110
Never cross this line again,
you trouble-making witch.

12:28.129 --> 12:31.190
Now, be gone,
and may your shrunken size

12:31.210 --> 12:34.210
be a lesson to you
to mend your evil ways.

12:34.230 --> 12:36.120
Oh, thank you. Ha ha.

12:36.139 --> 12:38.159
[snorting]
Thank you. Ha ha.

12:41.139 --> 12:44.090
Mm. They haven't seen
the last of me.

12:44.110 --> 12:47.129
I still have plenty of lives
left, you know.

12:47.149 --> 12:51.029
I'll get even. I'll get even.
