00:36.894 --> 00:38.554
Thank you for coming.

00:38.654 --> 00:42.794
I don't have much
time. Press tours.

00:42.894 --> 00:45.334
You're in demand.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.234
Yeah, it's nonstop.

00:49.974 --> 00:52.334
You sit there.

00:55.134 --> 00:57.434
I just need a
level for sound.

00:57.534 --> 01:00.514
One, two, three.
- Perfect.

01:00.614 --> 01:02.194
I'm terrible
at interviews.

01:02.294 --> 01:04.994
Occupational hazard
for both of us, right?

01:05.093 --> 01:07.675
I have something to confess.

01:07.775 --> 01:11.435
I'm a big fan. Would
you mind signing my copy?

01:11.535 --> 01:13.555
Of course.

01:13.655 --> 01:15.275
Erm...

01:15.375 --> 01:17.595
what would you
like me to write?

01:17.695 --> 01:19.235
You're the writer.

01:22.495 --> 01:23.955
There you go.

01:24.055 --> 01:26.595
"Can't write
without a reader.

01:26.695 --> 01:29.875
"It's precisely like a kiss -
you can't do it alone."

01:29.975 --> 01:33.555
Cute. So, who do you
regard with a mutual kiss?

01:33.655 --> 01:35.235
I don't kiss and tell.

01:35.335 --> 01:38.136
Ok.

01:39.696 --> 01:40.876
Your first book,

01:40.976 --> 01:44.956
an award-winning,
sexually charged memoir.

01:45.056 --> 01:48.416
Your second,
something entirely different...

01:49.576 --> 01:52.436
the story of a murdered boy.

02:10.015 --> 02:12.277
The LA Times
Book Prize - quite a win!

02:12.377 --> 02:15.037
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

02:15.137 --> 02:18.397
So, how does it feel
to be a literary darling?

02:18.497 --> 02:21.037
I'm trying not to
think about it, darling.

02:21.137 --> 02:24.997
The Times called it "an
erotic and audacious memoir".

02:25.097 --> 02:26.397
What do you call it?

02:26.497 --> 02:28.317
Uh, well... my life.

02:30.697 --> 02:35.717
..what's next, a film
adaptation? Another book?

02:35.817 --> 02:38.517
Well, I've been kidnapped
by my publisher for the week.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.837
He's a total sadist
in tortoiseshell glasses.

02:41.937 --> 02:43.718
And he's not go...

02:43.818 --> 02:46.918
He's not gonna let me go
until I give him the next book.

02:47.018 --> 02:50.318
A week of no
distractions, then?

02:50.418 --> 02:53.598
Uh... maybe one or two.

03:26.859 --> 03:29.159
Come on, hop out.
Stretch your legs.

03:29.259 --> 03:31.039
No, I'm waiting.

03:31.139 --> 03:32.959
Last one.

03:33.059 --> 03:35.039
I'm so proud of you.

03:35.139 --> 03:39.239
You'd be amazed how many
clients I have that cannot do PR.

03:39.339 --> 03:41.039
You calling me a whore?

03:41.139 --> 03:44.319
Yeah, a little.

03:44.419 --> 03:47.259
Thank God there's one of you.

04:30.821 --> 04:34.961
You know, the woman who
wrote that book grew up around here.

04:35.061 --> 04:37.901
Her father wrote
The Bellbird's Warning.

04:38.941 --> 04:40.961
Yeah, yeah. I know.

04:41.061 --> 04:42.761
You're her!

04:50.261 --> 04:52.441
"The silver-voiced bellbirds

04:52.541 --> 04:53.961
"The darlings of daytime

04:54.061 --> 04:57.722
"They sing in September
the songs of the May-time

04:57.822 --> 05:03.042
"When shadows wax
strong and thunderbolts hurtle

05:03.142 --> 05:06.162
"They lie..."
- Hide.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.402
They hide.

05:07.502 --> 05:09.122
"They hide with the fear..."

05:09.222 --> 05:12.442
Their fear.
- With their fear.

05:12.542 --> 05:15.802
"In the leaves of
the myrtle." - Oh, stop it.

05:15.902 --> 05:18.202
I love your
father's book. - Yes.

05:18.302 --> 05:20.962
It's my all-time
favourite. - I don't care.

05:21.062 --> 05:23.202
Ok, it's my second...
- Yes.

05:23.302 --> 05:25.202
..favourite.
- I don't care.

05:25.302 --> 05:27.643
Well, I do care.

05:27.743 --> 05:30.843
Being out here,
seeing this landscape...

05:30.943 --> 05:33.183
gets me hard.

05:34.623 --> 05:36.043
Gets me hard.

05:36.143 --> 05:38.143
Whoa.

05:44.023 --> 05:45.763
Do you think I should get out?
- No, don't.

05:45.863 --> 05:48.443
Another one of your fans?
- Just no.

05:48.543 --> 05:50.883
Oi, move!

05:50.983 --> 05:52.843
Don't be an idiot.
- Me?

05:52.943 --> 05:54.803
Well, because
country people out here...

05:54.903 --> 05:56.603
You know, it's different.
They're polite.

05:56.703 --> 05:58.803
That's real fuckin' polite.

05:58.903 --> 06:00.524
Hey, move!

06:00.624 --> 06:02.944
Move!

06:05.904 --> 06:08.244
He wants a rise out
of you. Please don't.

06:08.344 --> 06:10.784
Just don't give it to him.

06:13.304 --> 06:15.304
What's he doing?!

06:19.224 --> 06:20.964
Are you deaf and dumb?

06:21.064 --> 06:23.244
Just go.
- Hey!

06:23.344 --> 06:26.284
I've got your number.
You're a hazard!

06:26.384 --> 06:28.864
Just go.
- Idiot!

06:44.825 --> 06:49.485
I've sent the caretaker away
so we won't be disturbed.

07:06.266 --> 07:08.206
I know he sold
a lot of books, but...

07:08.306 --> 07:11.166
Family money.
My mother's side.

07:11.266 --> 07:14.386
What was she like?
- She died when I was five.

07:15.626 --> 07:17.566
That's his study. We...

07:17.666 --> 07:19.666
We don't go in there.

07:31.226 --> 07:33.226
It's locked.

07:34.066 --> 07:36.106
It's always locked.

07:41.307 --> 07:43.307
Huh!

07:47.947 --> 07:51.227
Happy now?
- Very happy.

07:59.427 --> 08:02.607
Who's that?
- Hmm?

08:02.707 --> 08:05.687
You and the hottie
lolling about half-naked.

08:07.867 --> 08:09.867
Yeah, she's no-one.

08:20.308 --> 08:22.648
Bit dusty.

08:22.748 --> 08:25.228
I haven't been home
since he died, so...

08:37.068 --> 08:39.568
And there it is.

08:39.668 --> 08:41.448
I hate that sound.

08:53.069 --> 08:56.249
Is the bellbird's
call actually a warning?

08:56.349 --> 08:58.529
Any time a real estate
agent tries to sell you

08:58.629 --> 09:01.129
a parcel of paradise with
those beautiful bellbird calls,

09:01.229 --> 09:02.809
don't walk - run.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.809
It's a trap?
- Exactly.

09:04.909 --> 09:07.609
You know, the bell miner -
it looks harmless enough

09:07.709 --> 09:10.369
but they kill everything around
them until there's nothing left.

09:10.469 --> 09:11.649
It's called dieback.

09:17.110 --> 09:19.730
Was your father's fame a trap?

09:19.830 --> 09:20.850
Sorry?

09:20.950 --> 09:22.810
Was it hard to live up to?

09:22.910 --> 09:25.290
Any time someone's
so universally loved,

09:25.390 --> 09:27.210
you don't have a choice.

09:27.310 --> 09:29.310
You walk in a long shadow.

10:58.313 --> 11:00.313
What?!

11:02.833 --> 11:06.453
Don't always want to be fucked
and choked at the same time.

11:06.553 --> 11:08.713
Not what it says in your memoir.

11:11.033 --> 11:13.773
You scratched me.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.953
Fuck!
- Sorry.

11:30.474 --> 11:34.974
Could it begin with a
song from their childhood?

11:42.074 --> 11:44.914
'Cause that's
the fucking problem.

13:41.318 --> 13:44.478
Fuck off!

14:34.319 --> 14:36.319
There she is.

14:37.719 --> 14:40.639
Sometimes
I don't want to be her.

15:29.601 --> 15:33.001
You have
nine new voice messages.

15:34.161 --> 15:36.061
Hey, it's me.

15:36.161 --> 15:38.181
I don't know why
I can't get through.

15:38.281 --> 15:41.181
Anyway, I'm arriving
on the 10 o'clock bus.

15:41.281 --> 15:43.421
I-I can't wait to see you.

15:43.521 --> 15:45.981
Hey, will you pick
me up in the old car?

15:46.081 --> 15:48.621
Ok, bye.

15:48.721 --> 15:51.262
# They hide
with their fear

15:51.362 --> 15:55.502
# In the leaves of the myrtle.

15:55.602 --> 15:58.742
Did you steal them?
- He gave them to me.

15:58.842 --> 16:01.022
He loves me.
- Gross!

16:27.443 --> 16:29.263
Which one?

16:29.363 --> 16:31.863
Stars. Yeah.

16:31.963 --> 16:33.423
I don't know why
she's gotta come now.

16:33.523 --> 16:36.823
Of all the weeks,
this week. This "no-one".

16:36.923 --> 16:38.903
Well, because she's not no-one.

16:39.003 --> 16:41.383
And, you know,
I haven't seen her for years.

16:41.483 --> 16:44.063
You'd do the same
for one of your friends.

16:44.163 --> 16:45.103
No, I wouldn't.

16:45.203 --> 16:48.423
Maybe... that's why
you haven't got any.

16:48.523 --> 16:49.823
I'm an island.

16:49.923 --> 16:53.383
Right, you stay here
and be an island.

16:53.483 --> 16:55.723
And I'll be back soon.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.904
Ah, and a word of warning -

17:00.004 --> 17:03.144
she's seductive
and a devious liar.

17:03.244 --> 17:05.384
Thought she was your friend.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.483
She is.

17:17.964 --> 17:20.424
He told me to tell you
something!

17:20.523 --> 17:23.324
You have to teach me a lesson.

17:26.124 --> 17:28.064
They don't have cars
where you come from?

17:28.164 --> 17:30.425
Povvo ones,
not like this sexy beast.

17:30.525 --> 17:32.785
Don't hurt it.
- I won't.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.265
Turn the key.

18:08.726 --> 18:12.386
Yeah, no, I'm looking
at the pages right now.

18:12.486 --> 18:13.946
Mm-hm.

18:14.046 --> 18:15.786
I know. I know it's overdue,
yeah.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.706
But she doesn't want anyone
to see it before she's finished.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.986
Uh-huh. And can I just tell you,

18:21.086 --> 18:23.306
I don't want to oversell it
but it's good.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.826
It's good, yeah. Maybe
even better than the old man.

18:25.926 --> 18:27.386
Uh-huh.

18:27.486 --> 18:30.446
Yeah, worth every
cent of our advance.

18:36.567 --> 18:38.507
Sorry I didn't come
see you at the funeral.

18:38.607 --> 18:40.267
It's Ok.
- I couldn't stay.

18:40.367 --> 18:42.747
I had this thing. I mean,
it's all very complicated.

18:42.847 --> 18:44.507
But anyway, that's done now.

18:44.607 --> 18:46.107
Totally done.
- It's Ok.

18:46.207 --> 18:48.427
Yeah, my fuckin' boss
accuses me of stealing their tips.

18:48.527 --> 18:51.267
And I thought,
"I've busted my arse for years

18:51.367 --> 18:53.027
"fucking schlepping
tables for that piece of shit."

18:53.127 --> 18:55.887
So fuck him.
- Did you steal them?

18:57.167 --> 19:00.107
Maybe. Hey, I had to.

19:00.207 --> 19:03.147
Rent, coke... Who knew
life was so expensive?

19:03.247 --> 19:05.787
What about that guy
you were seeing?

19:05.887 --> 19:07.227
Lenny?
- Yeah.

19:07.327 --> 19:12.228
Yeah, well, hard to see
someone who's serving 7 to 10.

19:12.328 --> 19:13.308
What did he do?

19:13.408 --> 19:16.368
Fucked me with an
intent to ruin my life.

19:29.728 --> 19:32.888
It's great to see
you, it really is. But...

19:34.408 --> 19:36.348
..you can't stay the whole week.

19:36.448 --> 19:38.908
I've got my
publisher here and I'm...

19:39.008 --> 19:41.249
trying to start the next book.

20:02.209 --> 20:03.469
Hi.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.569
Hey.

20:06.169 --> 20:08.589
And don't worry.

20:08.689 --> 20:11.149
You won't even know I'm here.

20:11.249 --> 20:13.370
I doubt that.

20:14.650 --> 20:17.030
Best friend.
- Publisher.

20:17.130 --> 20:17.950
Liar.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.610
She told you.
- She tells me everything.

20:24.610 --> 20:25.670
Warned.

20:25.770 --> 20:28.070
So which room should I take?

20:28.170 --> 20:30.550
Usual one?

20:30.650 --> 20:33.330
She means my old room. And...

20:34.530 --> 20:36.530
tongue back in mouth.

20:43.770 --> 20:46.271
Oh, my old bed!

20:46.371 --> 20:49.011
Oh, it's good to be back.

20:51.091 --> 20:54.991
Come on, you're gonna
have to stay in here with me.

20:55.091 --> 20:58.671
I'm working.
- Oh, come on! It'll be fun.

20:58.771 --> 21:01.871
Alright, maybe one night.
- Yeah, it'll be good.

21:01.971 --> 21:05.451
Just don't make a mess.
- What, me?

21:19.612 --> 21:22.752
How long is she staying?
- Couple of days.

21:22.852 --> 21:24.512
I don't know if that's good.

21:24.612 --> 21:27.432
Well, she's had a
rough trot, you know.

21:27.532 --> 21:30.032
I couldn't just put her back
on a bus and send her away.

21:30.132 --> 21:32.492
You're the one who
said she was a monster.

21:35.612 --> 21:39.112
God, look at you.
You're already under her spell.

21:39.212 --> 21:40.752
What?

21:40.852 --> 21:42.472
Calm down.

21:42.572 --> 21:44.872
Mum and Dad...

21:44.972 --> 21:46.972
cocktail time.

21:58.773 --> 22:01.373
So did she tell you about us?

22:03.133 --> 22:04.513
No.

22:04.613 --> 22:06.613
Perfect.

22:07.813 --> 22:10.653
"She was standing
at the bus stop.

22:12.493 --> 22:15.273
"Her clothes were far too tight.

22:15.373 --> 22:17.953
"Far too tight

22:18.053 --> 22:22.553
"for her curves, to contain her.

22:22.653 --> 22:27.594
"They strained
against her thighs...

22:27.694 --> 22:32.694
"the parts of her
she was trying to conceal."

22:41.094 --> 22:44.594
What are you,
a fuckin' man or a mouse?

22:44.694 --> 22:47.374
Um...

23:05.455 --> 23:07.635
I still
don't believe you.

23:07.735 --> 23:11.475
Seriously.

23:11.575 --> 23:14.095
No.
- How did you two meet?

23:15.615 --> 23:17.195
Catholic girls' school.
- Really?!

23:17.295 --> 23:20.475
Mmm. It happens,
not just in the movies.

23:20.575 --> 23:22.575
And pornos.

23:24.295 --> 23:26.355
Well, actually we met
in the confessional, so...

23:26.455 --> 23:28.035
Yeah, I had
a burning confession.

23:28.135 --> 23:29.315
And I was pretending
to be a priest

23:29.415 --> 23:31.456
and I wanted
to hear a secret.

23:33.536 --> 23:35.536
And what was the secret?

23:36.696 --> 23:39.476
Well...
- Well...

23:39.576 --> 23:42.196
I'd been felt up
by one of the nuns.

23:42.296 --> 23:45.276
Well, it was the first time I'd
been touched sexually, you know.

23:45.376 --> 23:48.156
And, well, I needed to tell
someone the good news

23:48.256 --> 23:49.716
so I turned to God.

23:49.816 --> 23:53.516
Yes, I have, um...
I've heard that one before.

23:53.616 --> 23:55.756
Yeah, well, you know...

23:55.856 --> 23:58.236
Jesus, it happened to
a lot of us. She's not special.

23:58.336 --> 24:01.156
Dark habits and lots
of canings in rectories.

24:03.977 --> 24:05.877
And instead of 10 Hail Marys...

24:05.977 --> 24:08.757
She invited me for the
summer to meet her famous father.

24:08.857 --> 24:11.817
I came every summer
until I stopped coming.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.837
And why did you stop coming?

24:17.937 --> 24:19.277
Well, that... that...

24:19.377 --> 24:21.317
I think we need
more alcohol for that.

24:24.977 --> 24:26.997
You know...

24:27.097 --> 24:29.117
I need to work tomorrow, so...

24:29.217 --> 24:31.797
I read your memoir.
- It's brilliant, isn't it?

24:31.897 --> 24:33.477
Don't.
- No, no.

24:33.577 --> 24:34.877
Look, he is right.

24:34.977 --> 24:36.878
I mean, it's not
The Bellbird's Warning,

24:36.978 --> 24:39.158
but it's brilliantly crafted.

24:39.258 --> 24:42.138
Maybe next time
you'll get what you deserve.

24:43.378 --> 24:45.518
A Pulitzer.

24:45.618 --> 24:49.098
She hates praise.

24:50.418 --> 24:52.838
I love praise.

24:52.938 --> 24:55.138
I'm going inside.

25:12.859 --> 25:16.119
Second novel syndrome.
- Is that what it is?

25:16.219 --> 25:18.219
I can hear you!

25:45.060 --> 25:46.640
Hey, I'm sorry.

25:46.740 --> 25:48.940
She's a bit distracting.

25:50.740 --> 25:52.160
I can't do it.

25:52.260 --> 25:56.700
Go and tell her.
I'll finish off here.

26:07.220 --> 26:09.720
# You are an obsession

26:09.820 --> 26:13.961
# I cannot sleep
I am your possession

26:14.061 --> 26:15.801
# Unopened at your feet

26:15.901 --> 26:17.961
# There's no balance

26:18.061 --> 26:19.841
# No equality

26:19.941 --> 26:24.241
# Be still
I will not accept defeat

26:24.341 --> 26:27.921
# I will have you
Yes, I will have you

26:28.021 --> 26:32.481
# I will find a way
and I will have you

26:32.581 --> 26:36.361
# Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly

26:36.461 --> 26:40.361
# I will collect you
and capture you

26:40.461 --> 26:44.601
# You are an obsession
You're my obsession

26:44.701 --> 26:49.042
# Who do you want me to be
to make you sleep with me?

26:49.142 --> 26:52.882
# You are an obsession
You're my obsession

26:52.982 --> 26:57.842
# Who do you want me to be
to make you sleep with me?

26:57.942 --> 27:00.002
# I feed you
I drink you

27:00.102 --> 27:01.682
# By day and by night

27:01.782 --> 27:04.122
# I need you
I need you

27:04.222 --> 27:06.282
# By sun or candlelight

27:06.382 --> 27:10.162
# You protest
You want to leave

27:10.262 --> 27:14.042
# Stay
Oh, there's no alternative

27:14.142 --> 27:15.842
# Your face appears again

27:15.942 --> 27:19.523
# I see the beauty
there, but I see danger...

27:19.623 --> 27:21.083
Goodnight.

27:21.183 --> 27:22.643
# Stranger beware

27:22.743 --> 27:26.523
# A circumstance
in your naked dreams...

27:26.623 --> 27:28.483
I thought you
were going to tell her.

27:28.583 --> 27:31.683
I tried.

28:16.624 --> 28:19.104
So she has actually read it.

28:20.664 --> 28:25.065
You were right. I should
never have let her stay.

28:27.945 --> 28:30.905
I'm in a hole with your advance.

28:32.265 --> 28:35.045
I need this book.

28:35.145 --> 28:39.765
And your beautiful liar
is getting in the way.

28:39.865 --> 28:42.405
So unless you tell her...

28:42.505 --> 28:44.505
I will.

28:55.105 --> 28:57.105
I'll do it.

29:26.186 --> 29:29.286
I just need peace and quiet
right now.

29:29.386 --> 29:30.687
You're taking it the wrong way.

29:30.787 --> 29:33.687
The wrong fucking way?
Which way should I take it?

29:33.787 --> 29:36.087
What's that story about the
guy in the attic and the painting?

29:36.187 --> 29:38.567
He gets younger as the
portrait withers and dies?

29:38.667 --> 29:40.487
Dorian Gray.
- Yes, Dorian Gray.

29:40.587 --> 29:42.647
'Cause I'm the withering
fucking portrait.

29:42.747 --> 29:44.727
You're just going
through a rough patch.

29:44.827 --> 29:48.067
Oh, how fucking reassuring!
You should write gift cards.

29:51.347 --> 29:53.167
So how's the writing coming on?

29:53.267 --> 29:54.967
It's fine.
- That's not what he said.

29:55.067 --> 29:57.447
Yeah? What'd he say?
- He said you're struggling.

29:57.547 --> 30:00.607
Well, maybe I am a little bit.
It's normal after such success.

30:00.707 --> 30:03.147
"That's normal
after such success."

30:06.908 --> 30:08.928
How much you want this time?

30:09.028 --> 30:12.668
I don't want your money.
- Well, what, then? Say it.

30:16.428 --> 30:20.068
This was a mistake.
You should go.

30:25.908 --> 30:28.828
You don't have to struggle.

30:42.029 --> 30:44.009
Turn it up!

30:44.109 --> 30:46.329
So demanding.

30:46.429 --> 30:49.489
Ahhh!

30:49.589 --> 30:51.789
It's alright, I've got it.
I've got this.

30:59.229 --> 31:01.649
Let's talk
about the story.

31:01.749 --> 31:04.249
Two girls, a boy.

31:04.349 --> 31:07.889
The boy dies.
- Mmm. They murder him.

31:07.989 --> 31:10.010
I'd like to read you
a passage for comment.

31:10.110 --> 31:12.190
Of course.

31:14.950 --> 31:16.610
Hey, you've done your research.

31:18.750 --> 31:21.450
Mmm. Yeah, there was
an accident.

31:21.550 --> 31:23.850
A boy died on your property.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.250
Yeah, true.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.090
And you write about
a murdered boy.

31:27.190 --> 31:29.690
Everything's fair game.
- Everything?

31:29.790 --> 31:31.790
And everyone.

31:41.670 --> 31:43.671
Don't.

31:48.151 --> 31:50.091
Ground rule number one -

31:50.191 --> 31:52.251
I need to work.

31:52.351 --> 31:54.851
So there is
no more boozy soirees -

31:54.951 --> 31:57.971
I need six hours
of quiet every day.

31:58.071 --> 32:00.531
No more boozy soirees.
- And no more music.

32:00.631 --> 32:02.611
Come on, that's not fair.
- Uh-uh-uh!

32:02.711 --> 32:04.811
Fine. No music.
- Good.

32:04.911 --> 32:09.031
If I hear so much as a peep out
of either of you, you're out.

32:10.111 --> 32:12.111
You got it?

32:13.031 --> 32:15.032
Got it.

32:16.112 --> 32:18.112
Good.

33:04.793 --> 33:07.013
I'm just going for a run.

33:07.113 --> 33:09.713
You're keen.

33:11.873 --> 33:13.853
You want to do something?

33:13.953 --> 33:16.493
Six hours a day.

33:16.593 --> 33:18.833
Just so precious.

33:20.354 --> 33:22.354
Yeah.

33:23.914 --> 33:26.834
I'm just gonna lie here
and do nothing.

33:57.915 --> 33:59.415
Fuck!

33:59.515 --> 34:02.935
There's a dead snake.

34:03.035 --> 34:05.135
How can I use that?

34:05.235 --> 34:07.675
There's a snake...

34:09.995 --> 34:13.855
Hey. Hey, listen, mate. Mate.

34:13.955 --> 34:15.895
I'm not sure if I
offended you the other day,

34:15.995 --> 34:18.495
but if I did,
I'm really sorry, Ok?

34:18.594 --> 34:20.455
I'm from the city. I'm not...

34:20.554 --> 34:22.635
Got to be careful of snakes.

34:24.034 --> 34:25.976
Definitely.

34:26.076 --> 34:28.116
Not here.

34:29.436 --> 34:32.116
Back there, where you came from.

34:34.275 --> 34:36.275
Those two girls.

34:38.755 --> 34:41.275
Fuckin' snakes.

34:42.476 --> 34:44.476
What? What?

34:47.396 --> 34:49.795
You tell 'em I hate snakes.

34:52.956 --> 34:55.235
Cut their heads off.

35:02.757 --> 35:04.757
Fuck!

35:16.037 --> 35:18.017
Oh, hi.

35:19.637 --> 35:22.417
I won't look over your shoulder.

35:22.517 --> 35:25.457
I will just quietly...

35:25.557 --> 35:28.257
quietly, quietly
drop that there.

35:28.357 --> 35:30.357
Hey, wait.

35:30.957 --> 35:32.958
Sit with me.

35:46.718 --> 35:48.858
So what's with the publisher?

35:48.958 --> 35:50.998
Don't know.

35:53.038 --> 35:55.818
He seems self-entitled to me.

35:55.918 --> 35:58.498
Mmm.

35:58.598 --> 36:01.018
Pretty nice and smart,
once you get to know him.

36:01.118 --> 36:03.718
Well, I won't get
to know him. - Thanks.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.539
I've missed this.

36:09.639 --> 36:11.639
Me too.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.699
I'm going to sell the property.

36:20.799 --> 36:22.979
You can't!

36:23.079 --> 36:25.879
I hardly ever come here...

36:27.039 --> 36:29.099
and there's too much history.

36:29.199 --> 36:31.819
So I'm going to
give you some money.

36:31.919 --> 36:33.919
You can go back to school.

36:35.159 --> 36:37.320
You set yourself up.

36:49.560 --> 36:50.860
That...

36:50.960 --> 36:52.340
country...

36:52.440 --> 36:54.060
fuckface

36:54.160 --> 36:56.640
threw a dead snake at me.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.640
It could have been alive.

37:16.201 --> 37:18.361
It's not finished, you know.

37:20.721 --> 37:23.541
Course it's not.

37:41.641 --> 37:44.182
Hey, you Ok?

37:44.282 --> 37:46.342
I'm far from Ok.

37:46.442 --> 37:49.862
Hey, sorry for... for laughing.

37:49.962 --> 37:52.942
He threw a dead snake at me!

37:53.042 --> 37:55.942
What the fuck?!
Is that a thing out here?

37:56.042 --> 37:57.982
No, not that I remember.

37:58.082 --> 38:01.782
Oh, he called you a snake too.
Wants to cut your head off, FYI.

38:01.882 --> 38:03.862
Charming.
- We have history, so...

38:03.962 --> 38:08.942
Oh, God, no. Really?!
- Not that kind of history!

38:09.042 --> 38:12.982
And anyway, I've got something
that's gonna cheer you up.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.343
Having a snake thrown at
you is a bit of a boner killer.

38:15.443 --> 38:17.823
I don't mean that.

38:17.923 --> 38:20.743
I mean this.

38:20.843 --> 38:23.103
Pages?
- Yeah.

38:23.203 --> 38:25.183
Well, it's the
beginning of something.

38:51.084 --> 38:54.284
He hates it.
- Oh, relax, will you?

39:03.564 --> 39:05.064
Well?

39:05.164 --> 39:07.804
Well, come on.
Don't hold us in suspense.

39:09.364 --> 39:11.364
It's not landing for me.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.304
Really?
- What does he mean?

39:15.404 --> 39:17.224
Sorry, what does that mean?

39:17.324 --> 39:19.544
It means I can see potential.

39:19.644 --> 39:22.065
Two women...

39:22.165 --> 39:24.985
..a dark secret,
away for the week.

39:25.085 --> 39:27.585
One a writer with
a publisher boyfriend - cheeky.

39:27.685 --> 39:31.085
The other, a muse.
- But?

39:33.965 --> 39:37.705
It lacks that
raw emotional honesty

39:37.805 --> 39:40.125
that your readers
have come to expect.

39:41.845 --> 39:43.845
Maybe you're right.

39:46.765 --> 39:49.905
Second novel syndrome.
- So how does it end?

39:50.005 --> 39:52.505
Right now, I'm thinking
of a death.

39:52.605 --> 39:54.806
The muse?
- The publisher.

39:55.766 --> 39:58.226
My own.

39:58.326 --> 40:01.286
God, can we have some fun now?

40:12.166 --> 40:15.886
What's taking her so long?
- She's angry at you.

40:21.406 --> 40:24.506
Holy Jesus! Is that real?

40:24.606 --> 40:26.266
Yeah, and it's loaded.

40:26.366 --> 40:30.907
In case we meet any
unwanted locals or snakes.

40:31.007 --> 40:33.367
She's a great shot.

40:41.167 --> 40:44.467
Oh, look at her.
She loves an audience.

40:44.567 --> 40:48.547
You're very protective of her.
- Somebody has to be.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.827
I can control myself.

40:50.927 --> 40:53.787
That's interesting, 'cause
most men prefer her, you know.

40:53.887 --> 40:55.307
My father, for one.

40:55.407 --> 40:57.667
He called her
his little bellbird.

40:57.767 --> 40:59.668
And that makes you angry?

40:59.768 --> 41:01.828
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

41:01.928 --> 41:03.948
Next minute,
we'll be mud-wrestling.

41:04.048 --> 41:07.448
It shouldn't, you know. You have
everything and she has nothing.

41:13.688 --> 41:16.708
Ok, so...

41:16.808 --> 41:21.548
you've got to jam it
into your shoulder really tight.

41:21.648 --> 41:24.108
Now, don't focus on the tip
of the barrel - focus here.

41:24.208 --> 41:26.848
Got it?
- I got it!

41:29.048 --> 41:30.988
Listen, I'm sorry about before.

41:31.088 --> 41:33.869
I like the pages, Ok?
- No, you don't.

41:33.969 --> 41:35.989
Anyway, it's Ok. They're shit.

41:36.089 --> 41:38.329
Come on.

41:40.529 --> 41:42.909
Fuck!

41:43.009 --> 41:45.469
Attaboy!
- Let me.

41:52.729 --> 41:55.969
Told you -
it's all in the shoulder.

42:08.890 --> 42:10.790
What happened to your foot?

42:10.890 --> 42:14.070
I just stepped on
a piece of glass. It's nothing.

42:14.170 --> 42:16.310
You're in the wars, aren't you?

42:16.410 --> 42:18.650
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

42:23.490 --> 42:28.550
Do you know why Butch
Cassidy likes to throw snakes?

42:28.650 --> 42:33.110
There's history.
- Yep, there certainly is.

42:33.210 --> 42:35.350
We were 14...
- We were here.

42:35.450 --> 42:37.631
Just as we are now.

42:37.731 --> 42:40.591
Sunny, his younger brother, was
standing over there on the shore

42:40.691 --> 42:42.691
and he tried to swim out to us.

42:43.891 --> 42:45.791
But he didn't make it.

42:45.891 --> 42:48.731
Actually, he...
- He drowned.

42:50.851 --> 42:52.891
He just drowned?

42:55.251 --> 42:57.711
You couldn't jump
in and save him?

42:57.811 --> 43:00.111
Doesn't seem like it's that far.

43:00.211 --> 43:05.091
We tried, but... No, it all
just happened so quickly.

43:09.931 --> 43:10.832
Well, that's the story.

43:10.932 --> 43:13.392
No, it's not just a story.
It's a statement of fact.

43:13.492 --> 43:16.472
You know, I gave a
statement to the police.

43:16.572 --> 43:19.332
Father helped us sort it out.

43:22.692 --> 43:24.692
So you knew him.

43:25.652 --> 43:26.992
What?

43:27.092 --> 43:30.352
The other day on the
road, when we arrived.

43:30.452 --> 43:34.672
You acted like you
didn't know him, but you did.

43:34.772 --> 43:37.952
You know,
if I remember correctly,

43:38.052 --> 43:40.652
I was protecting you
from yourself.

44:01.173 --> 44:04.133
"You know why...

44:05.733 --> 44:07.973
"he likes to throw snakes?

44:10.853 --> 44:13.813
"Because there's history."

44:17.054 --> 44:19.054
Fuck you!

44:44.054 --> 44:46.054
What are you doing?

44:47.254 --> 44:50.615
You have such expensive taste.

44:55.175 --> 44:58.095
Let me see. Um...

44:59.655 --> 45:02.195
What about this one?

45:02.295 --> 45:04.695
It's expensive.

45:08.335 --> 45:09.675
You're angry.

45:09.775 --> 45:11.775
No.

45:13.775 --> 45:16.515
It's McQueen.
You should have it.

45:16.615 --> 45:19.195
It's gonna look
better on you anyway.

45:19.295 --> 45:21.295
Thanks.

46:07.417 --> 46:09.597
Nice dress.

46:09.697 --> 46:11.697
Does she know you have it?

46:18.897 --> 46:23.017
Now, what's the one thing
that you want to see most of all?

46:24.897 --> 46:26.897
I don't have time for games.

46:27.938 --> 46:29.978
Think about it, fanboy.

47:20.419 --> 47:23.479
I know where all
the bodies are buried.

47:29.859 --> 47:32.880
Oh, God, that smell.

47:32.980 --> 47:35.420
It's exactly the same.

47:48.100 --> 47:51.020
I can feel him
watching us.

47:52.980 --> 47:55.100
I can too.

47:57.940 --> 48:00.960
Why are the windows
all boarded up?

48:01.060 --> 48:04.080
I don't know. It was
probably done after his death.

48:04.180 --> 48:07.961
Keep out the elements, fans.

48:08.061 --> 48:12.441
Like a shrine?
- More like a tomb.

48:12.541 --> 48:14.541
Ah!

48:15.941 --> 48:17.801
Look.

48:17.901 --> 48:20.141
My youth.

48:53.422 --> 48:55.602
So it's true.
- What's true?

48:55.702 --> 48:58.082
You were his favourite.
- Why do you say that?

48:58.182 --> 49:00.442
That's him in the reflection,
right?

49:00.542 --> 49:04.182
He always said I was
destined for greatness.

49:05.342 --> 49:07.822
Stupidly, I believed him.

49:09.102 --> 49:10.642
You're a waitress, aren't you?

49:10.742 --> 49:13.203
I got fired, so
technically I'm nothing.

49:13.303 --> 49:16.363
I'm sure
you're good at something.

49:16.463 --> 49:18.043
Yeah.

49:18.143 --> 49:20.903
Living in the shadow
of greatness.

49:22.543 --> 49:24.963
There is no sun without shadow.

49:25.063 --> 49:26.643
Camus said that.

49:26.743 --> 49:28.743
Fuck Camus.

49:29.183 --> 49:32.003
Yeah. Fuck Camus.

49:34.503 --> 49:37.443
Although she would
agree with him.

49:37.543 --> 49:39.123
So would the old man.

49:39.223 --> 49:42.323
He used his...
sunny powers of celebrity

49:42.423 --> 49:44.984
to help us with
the dead boy problem.

49:50.504 --> 49:52.284
What are you saying?

49:52.384 --> 49:55.744
What, he lied for you?
- El scandalo.

49:57.744 --> 49:59.164
She said it was an accident.

49:59.264 --> 50:02.624
You said it was an accident.
She avoided the question.

50:03.904 --> 50:05.004
What are you doing?

50:05.104 --> 50:08.364
I'm shining light on
the shadow of greatness.

50:08.464 --> 50:10.564
So, if it wasn't an accident...

50:10.664 --> 50:12.084
what happened?

50:12.184 --> 50:15.224
Why don't you ask her?
And while you're at it...

50:16.304 --> 50:18.665
ask her about her memoir.

50:21.065 --> 50:24.685
For someone who trades
in lies, you're pretty dim.

50:24.785 --> 50:27.285
Are you saying
she didn't write the book?

50:27.385 --> 50:30.965
Tap-tap-tap on
the keyboard. Hmm?

50:31.065 --> 50:33.385
Pretty easy to make that sound.

50:42.345 --> 50:44.445
You're un-fucking-believable.

50:44.545 --> 50:47.665
Don't you laugh at me.
- Look at you.

50:49.746 --> 50:52.566
You're wearing her dress,
claiming her story.

50:52.666 --> 50:55.326
Fuck you.
- You even tried to hit on me.

50:55.426 --> 50:57.006
I don't want you.

50:57.106 --> 50:58.926
I want you to get the fuck out

50:59.026 --> 51:01.626
before I smash
your fucking face in.

51:02.666 --> 51:05.306
Get the fuck out.

51:23.027 --> 51:24.567
I don't believe it.

51:24.667 --> 51:26.327
Good, because it's not true.

51:26.427 --> 51:28.687
She's jealous of you.
- She always has been.

51:28.787 --> 51:30.887
I said to you, don't trust her.

51:30.987 --> 51:33.007
But no, you're like
a cartoon wolf.

51:33.107 --> 51:35.047
It's not my fault
her life's a fucking mess.

51:36.347 --> 51:40.727
The hangovers, the losers!

51:40.827 --> 51:44.067
And then, just when she thinks
something's going to happen...

52:37.109 --> 52:39.469
Franklin...

52:53.269 --> 52:55.629
Sunny.

54:10.632 --> 54:12.632
Hello?

54:17.272 --> 54:19.272
Hello?

54:45.233 --> 54:47.313
What do you want?

54:50.633 --> 54:53.153
Hey, I... I don't want a fight.

54:54.473 --> 54:56.833
Seems like you do.

55:02.353 --> 55:05.033
Just trying to
figure out the truth.

55:06.473 --> 55:08.473
About?

55:12.033 --> 55:14.034
Your brother.

55:20.474 --> 55:22.974
I think she's writing about him.

55:23.074 --> 55:25.554
It's a free country.

55:29.474 --> 55:31.674
Did he drown in the lake?

55:37.274 --> 55:41.654
Do you know why
we called him Sunny?

55:41.754 --> 55:45.075
He was fuckin' terrified
of water. He couldn't swim.

55:47.275 --> 55:51.475
Like the Sundance Kid.
That was his nickname.

55:53.315 --> 55:55.475
I should've been there for him.

55:58.475 --> 56:01.395
How much justice
can you afford?

56:03.955 --> 56:06.355
That's how it
goes round here.

56:21.716 --> 56:25.176
Didn't you get the memo?
Jogging can kill.

56:25.276 --> 56:27.176
I'm heading back to the city.

56:27.276 --> 56:29.376
What? What's wrong now?

56:29.476 --> 56:32.776
Just confused.
- About?

56:32.876 --> 56:35.736
Us. You. Everything.

56:35.836 --> 56:38.676
You know, I can't believe
you're still going on about it.

56:42.836 --> 56:45.176
I spoke with Butch Cassidy.

56:45.276 --> 56:46.376
So?

56:46.476 --> 56:49.416
He tells me his
brother couldn't swim.

56:49.516 --> 56:52.377
If he couldn't swim, what
was he doing in the water?

56:52.477 --> 56:55.497
He was a horny boy.
I don't know.

56:55.597 --> 56:57.957
What happened to the kid?

56:59.037 --> 57:00.417
You know what?

57:00.517 --> 57:02.177
Maybe I need
a different publisher,

57:02.277 --> 57:04.137
one that believes in me.

57:04.237 --> 57:06.377
Why don't you stay out here?

57:06.477 --> 57:09.117
I hope a snake does bite you.

57:17.077 --> 57:21.297
Ever heard the expression
"A work of art is a confession?"

57:21.397 --> 57:22.977
No.

57:23.077 --> 57:25.178
Guess who said that.

57:25.278 --> 57:27.098
Fortune cookie?

57:27.198 --> 57:30.938
Albert Camus. I'm
surprised you didn't know that.

57:31.038 --> 57:33.278
Yeah, well, fuck Camus.

57:34.918 --> 57:39.738
Why would I write a
confession and hide it in a story?

57:39.838 --> 57:42.978
I don't know. That's what
I'm trying to get straight.

57:43.078 --> 57:46.058
Well, it wouldn't be much
of a confession, would it?

57:46.158 --> 57:49.038
Not unless
there's another reason.

57:50.878 --> 57:53.758
But then,
you don't kiss and tell.

57:55.958 --> 57:58.479
Well, that depends.
- On?

57:59.599 --> 58:01.419
The kiss.

58:37.560 --> 58:40.660
"I was in Moscow after Glasnost.

58:40.760 --> 58:43.740
"Such wealth and poverty,

58:43.840 --> 58:46.960
"all entirely without rules.

58:48.040 --> 58:51.320
"A powder keg of depravity.

58:52.760 --> 58:55.460
"I was staying in a hostel

58:55.560 --> 58:57.900
"near the train station.

58:58.000 --> 59:01.621
"I'd run out of money,
knew no-one.

59:01.721 --> 59:04.501
"But I thought, a girl
like me can always find

59:04.601 --> 59:07.721
"the sharp edge of a knife."

59:13.121 --> 59:16.941
So I found an
underground club.

59:17.041 --> 59:20.541
It was some abandoned
remnant of a hotel -

59:20.641 --> 59:24.021
it was full of
oligarchs and hookers.

59:24.121 --> 59:28.021
The Hotel Rossiya.

59:28.121 --> 59:32.001
I danced and I drank
whatever they gave me.

59:38.322 --> 59:41.402
And then I wasn't in
the Hotel Rossiya anymore...

59:42.682 --> 59:44.762
..and I wasn't dancing.

59:47.282 --> 59:49.582
When I woke up,

59:49.682 --> 59:54.022
all I could see was a forest.

59:54.122 --> 59:55.702
Trees and shadows.

59:55.802 --> 59:58.662
There were lots of
shadows moving around me,

59:58.762 --> 01:00:02.142
with torchlights.

01:00:02.242 --> 01:00:04.882
And they were
pushing me forward.

01:00:08.123 --> 01:00:10.643
One of them, he took my hand.

01:00:12.763 --> 01:00:15.363
The other, he stripped me naked.

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:21.083
He forced me onto the
ground and he spread my legs.

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:26.063
My whole body burned

01:00:26.163 --> 01:00:29.363
from the fallen
needles of the fir trees.

01:00:31.963 --> 01:00:34.243
They were cutting into my skin.

01:00:37.363 --> 01:00:40.824
And then I felt
the first shadow.

01:00:40.924 --> 01:00:44.364
And then when he
finished, the next started.

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:47.684
And then the next.

01:00:49.564 --> 01:00:52.964
The funny thing was,
I wasn't thinking...

01:00:54.724 --> 01:00:59.584
I thought, "This isn't
an orgy. This isn't rape.

01:00:59.684 --> 01:01:03.504
"This isn't dirt in
my mouth. This is theatre.

01:01:03.604 --> 01:01:06.384
"I need to play my
part and play it well."

01:01:06.484 --> 01:01:10.564
So I stared straight into those
flashlights and I didn't flinch.

01:01:13.805 --> 01:01:18.805
It's so hard to imagine
that terror can be so erotic.

01:01:20.405 --> 01:01:23.065
But it can...

01:01:23.165 --> 01:01:25.525
when you're being
fucked by shadows.

01:01:34.485 --> 01:01:38.785
You don't think she could
have come up with that, do you?

01:01:38.885 --> 01:01:40.825
I mean, she's good.

01:01:40.925 --> 01:01:43.565
But she's not as good as me.

01:01:46.086 --> 01:01:48.326
I'm ruined.

01:01:50.086 --> 01:01:52.206
Welcome to the club.

01:01:53.806 --> 01:01:55.186
Hey!

01:01:55.286 --> 01:01:57.586
Now who's the
pathetic one? Go on.

01:01:57.686 --> 01:01:59.506
Take it out on me.

01:01:59.606 --> 01:02:01.606
Be a man! Huh?

01:02:10.886 --> 01:02:12.886
It's hard to imagine...

01:02:14.246 --> 01:02:16.186
..terror can be so erotic.

01:02:16.286 --> 01:02:19.047
But it can be, when
you're being fucked by shadows.

01:02:31.087 --> 01:02:33.847
Now you have the real thing.

01:02:54.568 --> 01:02:56.908
Don't you see that
one lie leads to another?

01:02:57.008 --> 01:02:59.348
You know...
- The fake memoir, the dead boy?

01:02:59.448 --> 01:03:01.148
I didn't know
he couldn't swim.

01:03:01.248 --> 01:03:03.868
I don't think you know
what's true anymore.

01:03:03.968 --> 01:03:05.028
That would be fine,

01:03:05.128 --> 01:03:08.588
except for the fact that
you have destroyed my life,

01:03:08.688 --> 01:03:12.028
stolen someone else's
and quite possibly killed a boy.

01:03:12.128 --> 01:03:13.588
So...

01:03:13.688 --> 01:03:15.988
So you come here,

01:03:16.088 --> 01:03:17.828
you assault her,

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:19.928
and then you try to leave.

01:03:21.008 --> 01:03:23.828
You're kidding me.

01:03:23.928 --> 01:03:27.029
Can I do that?
Can I do that?

01:03:27.129 --> 01:03:29.129
Fuck it. Yes, I can.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:36.529
Ok. Go to the police, then.

01:03:39.209 --> 01:03:40.869
Nah.

01:03:40.969 --> 01:03:42.969
I don't think you will.

01:03:44.969 --> 01:03:46.969
Maybe I will.

01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:23.050
Come on, Sunny. Sing!

01:04:51.091 --> 01:04:54.171
You were there.
You tell me what happened.

01:04:57.291 --> 01:05:01.871
# When shadows wax strong

01:05:01.971 --> 01:05:06.632
# And the thunderbolts hurtle

01:05:06.732 --> 01:05:10.912
# They hide with their fear

01:05:11.012 --> 01:05:15.432
# In the leaves of the myrtle.

01:05:15.532 --> 01:05:17.532
Sunny!

01:05:19.052 --> 01:05:21.172
What the fuck is that?

01:05:29.732 --> 01:05:33.052
The last words he ever heard.

01:05:35.653 --> 01:05:37.713
Get fuckin' off me!

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:38.993
Get off me!

01:05:39.093 --> 01:05:42.153
I can call her back. I
called her here the first time!

01:05:42.253 --> 01:05:44.033
No, I asked her to come.

01:05:44.133 --> 01:05:45.793
The muse - I asked.

01:05:45.893 --> 01:05:48.993
Then he gets her and he
THROWS her up against the wall

01:05:49.093 --> 01:05:52.853
and he says,
"You fuckin' bitch!"

01:05:59.133 --> 01:06:01.133
Forgot my phone. Just a sec.

01:06:15.334 --> 01:06:17.334
Hey.

01:06:27.214 --> 01:06:29.214
Oh...

01:06:38.054 --> 01:06:42.195
Hi! Sorry, he's decided to stay.

01:06:42.295 --> 01:06:44.295
Suit yourself.

01:06:50.655 --> 01:06:52.675
Long way to come
to change your mind.

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.775
That's what I said.

01:07:42.056 --> 01:07:44.416
She knows
what she's going to do.

01:07:47.297 --> 01:07:49.577
She's just waiting now.

01:07:52.297 --> 01:07:54.357
The study window.

01:07:54.457 --> 01:07:56.877
It's boarded up.

01:07:56.977 --> 01:08:01.197
Shafts of light
through the boards.

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:11.457
And he's yelling,
"You fucking bitch!

01:08:12.897 --> 01:08:14.997
"Let me out."
- Let me out!

01:08:15.097 --> 01:08:17.096
He's trapped.

01:08:19.457 --> 01:08:21.438
Little bellbird.

01:08:23.377 --> 01:08:25.377
Come inside.

01:08:29.218 --> 01:08:31.258
Where's the other one?

01:08:32.618 --> 01:08:34.938
She's down at the lake... No.

01:08:36.138 --> 01:08:38.698
She's with Butch Cassidy.

01:08:53.899 --> 01:08:57.299
And she is covered in blood.

01:09:01.019 --> 01:09:03.019
She's got a very...

01:09:03.658 --> 01:09:05.658
faint smile.

01:09:30.819 --> 01:09:33.880
I want to refer to
a term you used earlier -

01:09:33.979 --> 01:09:35.319
"dieback".

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.359
When the bell miner takes
everything good from the tree,

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.120
leaving it to rot
from the top down.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:41.680
How do you stop it?

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:45.000
Well, you have to start again.
Burn everything to the ground.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.680
Something new
has to go in its place,

01:09:46.779 --> 01:09:48.600
something living
to replace the dead.

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:51.479
It occurs to me that you've
done the same thing with your book -

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.320
erased the past and
replaced it with something new,

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.320
a new story about
the murdered boy.

01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.961
No, you can't change the past.

01:09:58.061 --> 01:10:00.101
But you can rewrite it.

01:10:28.901 --> 01:10:30.602
He's got a gun.

01:10:30.702 --> 01:10:32.762
Yep.

01:10:32.862 --> 01:10:34.862
And so have we.

01:10:43.302 --> 01:10:45.502
Like to beat up women, do you?

01:10:59.342 --> 01:11:02.642
I'm talking to you!

01:11:02.742 --> 01:11:06.583
I just don't want
any more trouble.

01:11:08.303 --> 01:11:11.823
This is what happens
when you make up stories.

01:11:40.144 --> 01:11:42.124
"I just don't want...

01:11:42.224 --> 01:11:46.224
"any... more... trouble."

01:11:57.024 --> 01:12:00.344
Can you read
this out loud for me?

01:12:05.424 --> 01:12:07.424
Take your time.

01:12:09.545 --> 01:12:11.885
"First it was just us.

01:12:11.985 --> 01:12:13.925
"It was a driving lesson.

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:18.005
"Then we decided to go
swimming, turned onto the track,

01:12:18.105 --> 01:12:21.925
"the one that leads to the lake,
and that's when we saw him."

01:12:22.025 --> 01:12:24.885
Could you hold it there
for just one second?

01:12:24.985 --> 01:12:28.165
Do you mind if
we take a short break?

01:12:28.265 --> 01:12:30.265
No.

01:12:31.185 --> 01:12:33.185
I'll be right back.

01:12:52.346 --> 01:12:54.126
Hey.

01:12:54.226 --> 01:12:56.306
How's it going?
- Good.

01:12:58.106 --> 01:12:59.526
What's she like?

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:02.806
Classic narcissistic
personality disorder,

01:13:02.906 --> 01:13:04.726
plus daddy issues.

01:13:04.826 --> 01:13:08.266
Sounds like fun.
- Barrel of monkeys fun.

01:13:20.107 --> 01:13:22.187
Where were we?

01:13:23.707 --> 01:13:25.707
That's right - you were reading.

01:13:31.587 --> 01:13:33.727
"At first it was just us.

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:36.607
"A driving lesson, but then
we decided to go swimming."

01:13:36.707 --> 01:13:39.747
I don't get it. Maybe
you can clear this up for me.

01:13:40.867 --> 01:13:43.647
One is a sworn
statement of truth

01:13:43.747 --> 01:13:47.168
and one is a complete fiction.

01:13:47.268 --> 01:13:49.548
But which one is which?

01:13:50.988 --> 01:13:53.348
Please, isn't it obvious?

01:13:56.108 --> 01:13:57.928
At this point in our interview,

01:13:58.028 --> 01:14:00.048
I would like to
read you your rights.

01:14:00.148 --> 01:14:02.688
You don't need to do that.
- I do need to do that.

01:14:02.788 --> 01:14:04.768
Because what happens
with someone like you

01:14:04.868 --> 01:14:06.808
is you get a
high-priced lawyer

01:14:06.908 --> 01:14:09.328
to come in and say that
I didn't follow procedure,

01:14:09.428 --> 01:14:13.228
and then the whole thing
gets tossed out on a technicality.

01:14:15.148 --> 01:14:17.188
Do you understand?

01:14:18.548 --> 01:14:20.089
Yes.

01:14:26.389 --> 01:14:29.449
Ok, I'll talk to him and
get a sense of how mad he is.

01:14:29.549 --> 01:14:32.009
Pretty mad, I'd say.
- Tries anything, shoot him.

01:14:32.109 --> 01:14:34.389
I can't shoot...
- Take it!

01:14:36.269 --> 01:14:39.129
Hey, it's me.

01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:41.129
Um...

01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:43.389
I'm sorry if I hurt you earlier.

01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:47.249
But what do you say -
could we...

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.989
Could we work towards
an amicable resolution?

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:31.391
What the...
- Fuck?!

01:15:37.151 --> 01:15:39.151
Go.

01:15:49.191 --> 01:15:51.251
Be careful!

01:16:08.752 --> 01:16:11.552
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

01:16:27.472 --> 01:16:29.052
Oh!

01:16:35.513 --> 01:16:36.973
Don't shoot!

01:16:37.073 --> 01:16:39.073
He's running!

01:16:53.913 --> 01:16:57.073
Why write a different
version of the same events?

01:16:59.153 --> 01:17:02.013
Which one is true?
Which one is the lie?

01:17:02.113 --> 01:17:04.014
One of them couldn't
exist without the other.

01:17:04.114 --> 01:17:08.214
I'm talking about a murder,
not a... a literary device!

01:17:08.314 --> 01:17:10.094
The coroner
ruled it inconclusive.

01:17:10.194 --> 01:17:12.814
But he didn't know
that the boy couldn't swim.

01:17:12.914 --> 01:17:15.014
He was terrified of water.

01:17:15.114 --> 01:17:17.334
You had it removed
from the record.

01:17:17.434 --> 01:17:19.614
My father did.
He was protecting me.

01:17:19.714 --> 01:17:23.054
And your friend?
Did he protect her?

01:17:52.915 --> 01:17:54.915
Go right!

01:18:03.955 --> 01:18:05.255
Get up!

01:18:05.355 --> 01:18:07.355
Get up!

01:18:27.716 --> 01:18:31.176
# I will have you
Yes, I will have you

01:18:31.276 --> 01:18:36.096
# I will find a way
and I will have you

01:18:36.196 --> 01:18:39.696
# Like a butterfly
A wild butterfly...

01:18:45.277 --> 01:18:47.137
Get out.

01:18:47.237 --> 01:18:49.997
I-I won't go to the police.

01:18:52.597 --> 01:18:55.937
Whatever you're
thinking, please... don't.

01:18:56.037 --> 01:18:58.037
Just shut up and walk.

01:19:02.157 --> 01:19:04.157
Walk!

01:19:19.918 --> 01:19:22.298
Did she do that to you?

01:19:22.398 --> 01:19:24.298
You did that.

01:19:24.398 --> 01:19:26.138
You assaulted her, remember?

01:19:26.238 --> 01:19:28.978
Just tell him.
- Tell me what?!

01:19:29.078 --> 01:19:31.198
He was here too.

01:19:35.358 --> 01:19:38.978
# The silver-voiced bellbirds

01:19:39.078 --> 01:19:42.338
# The darlings of daytime

01:19:42.438 --> 01:19:46.378
# They sing in September

01:19:46.478 --> 01:19:49.779
# The songs of the May-time

01:19:49.879 --> 01:19:56.459
# When shadows wax strong
and the thunderbolts hurtle

01:19:56.559 --> 01:20:03.519
# They hide with their fear
in the leaves of the myrtle...

01:20:12.119 --> 01:20:14.499
Go on, tell him.
- Why?

01:20:14.599 --> 01:20:17.179
Because it matters.
- Not to me! It doesn't matter.

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:20.840
He got out of hand,
just like you have.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.180
Help!

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.260
Sunny, get off.
Sunny, get off!

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.700
Help! Help!

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.460
Sunny!

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:36.360
Get off! Help!

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.700
Get off, Sunny! Help!

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.521
So you killed him
in self-defence.

01:20:56.841 --> 01:20:58.841
No.

01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:02.481
Not exactly.

01:21:10.161 --> 01:21:12.361
Is he dead?

01:21:14.841 --> 01:21:16.821
Tell him everything.

01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:19.601
You don't have to
lie for me anymore.

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:26.322
Grab his arms. Do it!

01:21:31.802 --> 01:21:34.402
I covered it up.
- WE covered it up.

01:21:37.402 --> 01:21:39.502
But not anymore.

01:21:39.602 --> 01:21:42.182
The truth needs to be told.

01:21:42.282 --> 01:21:44.302
He's alive.

01:21:44.402 --> 01:21:46.222
He's alive!

01:21:49.962 --> 01:21:52.622
He's alive!

01:21:52.722 --> 01:21:54.722
He's gone.

01:21:57.602 --> 01:22:01.023
I found a way to step out of
the shadows and into the light.

01:22:01.123 --> 01:22:05.383
We went back to the house and
I explained everything to Father.

01:22:05.483 --> 01:22:08.443
I told him that
Sunny attacked me.

01:22:09.603 --> 01:22:11.623
And I made him
believe it was true

01:22:11.723 --> 01:22:14.823
so that he would protect me.

01:22:14.923 --> 01:22:16.623
And did he protect you?

01:22:16.723 --> 01:22:18.143
Yes.

01:22:18.243 --> 01:22:20.063
And after she told her father,

01:22:20.163 --> 01:22:23.263
they made up a whole new
story and said it was an accident.

01:22:23.363 --> 01:22:25.603
And I had to go along
with the whole fucking thing.

01:22:28.403 --> 01:22:31.023
What the fuck's this
got to do with me?!

01:22:31.123 --> 01:22:33.964
I told you,
she needs an audience.

01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:38.744
Oh, not now. The show's over.

01:22:38.844 --> 01:22:41.504
And you know too much.
- You could stop her.

01:22:41.604 --> 01:22:43.544
I don't want to stop her.

01:22:43.644 --> 01:22:45.764
Your DNA.

01:22:47.404 --> 01:22:49.384
Her bruises.
- Fuckin' liars!

01:22:49.484 --> 01:22:50.664
It's just enough for the police

01:22:50.764 --> 01:22:52.504
to buy you as a
violent sexual predator.

01:22:52.604 --> 01:22:55.384
How do you fuckin'
live with yourself?!

01:22:55.484 --> 01:22:57.964
Now you know the end.
I hope you're not disappointed.

01:22:59.124 --> 01:23:02.324
It's not exactly an 'up' ending.

01:23:03.924 --> 01:23:05.925
Best friend.

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:31.945
"At first, it was
just us - a driving lesson.

01:23:32.045 --> 01:23:35.465
"But then we decided
to go swimming.

01:23:35.565 --> 01:23:38.426
"We turned at the track,

01:23:38.526 --> 01:23:41.306
"the one that leads to the lake,

01:23:41.406 --> 01:23:43.766
"and that's where we saw him.

01:23:46.366 --> 01:23:49.386
"I'll never forget
what happened.

01:23:49.486 --> 01:23:52.166
"We were floating
around on the pontoon.

01:23:53.446 --> 01:23:55.966
"I remember him
diving into the water.

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:01.886
"But he never came up for air."

01:24:03.886 --> 01:24:07.166
"He just vanished."

01:24:13.807 --> 01:24:15.907
Why isn't there a
statement from your friend?

01:24:16.007 --> 01:24:18.747
Because they believed me.
- I don't believe you.

01:24:18.847 --> 01:24:21.587
You're gonna need
more evidence than that.

01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:24.307
I know you killed him.

01:24:24.407 --> 01:24:26.227
I know it.

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.067
But what I can't understand

01:24:28.167 --> 01:24:30.607
is why you would
write a book about it.

01:24:32.247 --> 01:24:35.867
Mack Barton, the real boy.

01:24:35.967 --> 01:24:41.107
15 years old. Brother to
Angus, son to Keith and Judy.

01:24:41.207 --> 01:24:45.448
You have the power
to give the family closure.

01:24:48.008 --> 01:24:51.288
Did you kill Mack Barton?

01:24:53.808 --> 01:24:55.508
You charge me

01:24:55.608 --> 01:24:57.608
or you let me go.

01:25:00.928 --> 01:25:03.268
It's for her,
isn't it? The book?

01:25:03.368 --> 01:25:06.908
Oh, congratulations - you've
read the dedication. Well done.

01:25:07.008 --> 01:25:09.308
I'm actually talking
to the wrong person.

01:25:09.408 --> 01:25:11.588
I should be talking to her.

01:25:11.688 --> 01:25:14.668
If you see your friend, tell
her that I'd like to speak to her.

01:25:14.768 --> 01:25:16.769
Yeah, if I see her.

He read your book.

01:25:31.609 --> 01:25:33.609
Made a complaint.

01:25:43.209 --> 01:25:46.309
"Your DNA, her bruises -
just enough for the police

01:25:46.409 --> 01:25:49.690
"to buy you as a
violent sexual predator.

01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:55.150
"Now you know how it ends.
I hope you're not disappointed.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:58.130
"It's not exactly
an 'up' ending."

01:25:59.330 --> 01:26:02.830
But, of course,
that's not how it ends.

01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:05.030
You'll have to buy the book.
