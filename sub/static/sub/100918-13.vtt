-Break it up!
-That band geek's a psycho.

00:52.890 --> 00:54.359
He just hit me
with his tuba.

00:54.392 --> 00:57.261
[Mr. Levine] Take him
to the nurse.

00:57.295 --> 00:59.063
What's gotten into you?

00:59.095 --> 01:00.298
[breathing heavily]

01:00.331 --> 01:03.701
He called me Tuba Turd.

01:03.734 --> 01:07.138
So you bashed him in the head
like that? Look at him!

01:07.171 --> 01:10.174
What's your mom going to say?

01:10.207 --> 01:11.543
She told me to.

01:11.575 --> 01:14.278
Sure, she did.
Come on. Let's go find her.

01:14.311 --> 01:17.680
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

[electricity buzzing]

02:44.534 --> 02:48.205
[girl] What's wrong?

02:48.239 --> 02:52.409
Why aren't you moving?

02:52.443 --> 02:54.992
What's happening?

02:58.316 --> 03:00.265
Dad, wake up.

03:03.987 --> 03:07.223
Daddy! Daddy!

03:07.258 --> 03:08.992
Daddy?

03:09.026 --> 03:12.528
Daddy?

03:12.562 --> 03:15.233
Hello.

03:15.265 --> 03:17.868
What's happening?

03:17.902 --> 03:20.871
Don't worry, child.
He'll be all right.

03:20.905 --> 03:22.941
What's wrong with my dad?

03:22.973 --> 03:27.945
Well, what's happening
right now, to your father,
and to all of them...

03:27.979 --> 03:31.015
They're going to
think differently
when they wake up.

03:31.015 --> 03:32.949
They're going to believe
in all the right things.

03:32.949 --> 03:34.519
All the things they should.

03:34.551 --> 03:36.420
They're going to become
better people.

03:36.454 --> 03:38.389
Good people.

03:38.389 --> 03:40.691
My dad's already
a good person.

03:40.723 --> 03:43.727

Pat! Pat, wake up!

04:10.820 --> 04:13.189
Court?

04:13.223 --> 04:17.194
Courtney?
Your mom's not moving.

04:17.228 --> 04:21.531
Oh, don't you worry about
Ms. Barbara.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.600
[chuckles]
<i>In less than 30 minutes,</i>

04:23.634 --> 04:27.204
<i>Brainwave's reprogramming</i>
<i>will be complete...</i>

04:27.237 --> 04:30.574
<i>and permanent.</i>

04:30.608 --> 04:34.478
<i>Courtney's mother will become</i>
<i>a part of our new society.</i>

04:34.512 --> 04:38.615
<i>Our New America.</i>

04:38.649 --> 04:43.649
Like everyone under
Brainwave's little spell.

04:44.288 --> 04:48.026
[people shouting indistinctly]

04:48.059 --> 04:52.560
Unless of course, Ms. Barbara
is one of those unlucky
"one-in-fours" that

04:52.560 --> 04:57.401
pushes back too hard,
or for too long.

04:57.435 --> 05:00.637
<i>While they do that,</i>

05:00.637 --> 05:02.639
<i>their entire nervous system</i>
<i>will shut down.</i>

05:02.639 --> 05:03.841
-Mr. Levine?
-[girl] Oh, my God!

05:03.841 --> 05:06.242
-[the Gambler] <i>They'll expire.</i>
-Mr. Levine!

05:06.276 --> 05:09.680
Poor things.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.680
Dad?

05:22.158 --> 05:24.995
Here, Pat, it's me!

05:25.028 --> 05:27.497
It's Courtney!

05:27.531 --> 05:29.632
Your daughter.

05:37.908 --> 05:39.444
[panting]

05:39.478 --> 05:43.447
Ever since we came
to Blue Valley,
you've been there for me...

05:43.480 --> 05:47.218
every time I needed you.

05:47.218 --> 05:50.250
I need you now, Pat.

05:52.423 --> 05:57.372
<i>I really, really need you.</i>

06:00.463 --> 06:02.867
-What's wrong with him?
-Brainwave's got him.

06:02.901 --> 06:06.504
Remember, Justin,
you are the Silent Knight!

06:06.504 --> 06:08.406
The Shining Knight.

06:08.406 --> 06:12.076
Well, I don't know.

06:12.110 --> 06:15.413
Chuck. If Brainwave's broadcast
is affecting every adult,

06:15.446 --> 06:16.814
why not the bad guys?

06:16.814 --> 06:18.016
[Dr. Mid-Nite] <i>I'd theorize</i>
<i>they're wearing</i>

06:18.016 --> 06:19.884
<i>a signal-blocking earpiece</i>
<i>of some kind,</i>

06:19.884 --> 06:21.685
<i>protecting them</i>
<i>from the broadcast.</i>

06:21.718 --> 06:25.223
Okay. Can we mimic
the blocking signal somehow?

06:25.257 --> 06:29.560
I'm afraid I'd need to examine
<i>one of the earpieces</i>
<i>to do that.</i>

06:29.593 --> 06:32.029
Beth, Pat's fighting
Brainwave's control!

06:32.062 --> 06:37.000
What? No,
that could kill him, Court!

06:37.033 --> 06:40.471
[electricity buzzing]

06:40.504 --> 06:42.372
We need help, Beth.

06:42.406 --> 06:47.355
I know! I know!
I hear you, guys!

06:47.444 --> 06:49.547
Wait.

06:49.579 --> 06:51.749
I hear them.

06:51.783 --> 06:55.187
Chuck! That's it,
I hear them.

06:55.220 --> 06:58.889
When I was under Cindy's house,
<i>I couldn't hear anyone.</i>

06:58.923 --> 07:02.560
Can we see if there's
some kind of signal blockers,

07:02.593 --> 07:05.062
like those earpieces,
down in the tunnels?

07:05.096 --> 07:06.997
[Dr. Mid-Nite]
<i>Great thinking, Beth.</i>

07:07.031 --> 07:10.367
I've located several frequency
<i>blocking systems within</i>
<i>the tunnels below.</i>

07:10.401 --> 07:11.870
<i>They're currently off.</i>

07:11.903 --> 07:15.639
Because they know
we're down there.

07:15.673 --> 07:19.276
But, if we can turn
the blockers back on,

07:19.310 --> 07:23.048
we could free Pat and Justin!

07:23.081 --> 07:25.916
<i>You think you can break</i>
<i>into my security system</i>
<i>that easily?</i>

07:25.949 --> 07:28.653
[Dr. Mid-Nite]
<i>He's correct, Beth.</i>
<i>It's proving difficult.</i>

07:28.687 --> 07:32.122
<i>Every time I break through</i>
<i>one of his firewalls,</i>
<i>he puts another one up.</i>

07:32.156 --> 07:33.591
<i>It's a stalemate.</i>

07:33.624 --> 07:35.793
If the Gambler's so focused
on keeping us out,

07:35.826 --> 07:38.362
maybe we can divert
his attention elsewhere.

07:38.396 --> 07:40.264
What else can we
hack into, Chuck?

07:40.298 --> 07:44.435
<i>Hmm. How about we target</i>
<i>what the Gambler cares about</i>
<i>more than anything else?</i>

07:44.468 --> 07:45.802
[Beth] <i>What's that?</i>

07:45.836 --> 07:48.406
[Dr. Mid-Nite] <i>His money.</i>

07:48.439 --> 07:50.307
What?

07:50.307 --> 07:54.144
[Dr. Mid-Nite] <i>I've accessed</i>
<i>his various bank accounts,</i>
<i>both onshore and off.</i>

07:54.177 --> 07:55.747
Hey.

07:55.781 --> 07:59.584
<i>-Get out of there!</i>
-I volunteer every Christmas
for the American Red Cross,

07:59.617 --> 08:02.452
<i>but there are so many</i>
<i>worthy charities.</i>

08:02.485 --> 08:06.389
Why pick one?

08:06.423 --> 08:09.293
[the Gambler] <i>Stop it!</i>

08:09.326 --> 08:12.161
No!

08:12.196 --> 08:13.463
Stop!

08:13.497 --> 08:16.968
Get out of there!

08:16.968 --> 08:19.103
[Dr. Mid-Nite] <i>With the Gambler</i>
<i>occupied, I've accessed</i>

08:19.103 --> 08:21.072
<i>the frequency blockers</i>
<i>in the tunnels.</i>

08:21.105 --> 08:22.839
<i>I can't keep them on</i>
<i>very long,</i>

08:22.874 --> 08:25.110
<i>but even a momentary</i>
<i>interruption in the signal</i>

08:25.142 --> 08:28.545
<i>should disconnect</i>
Pat and Justin from Brainwave.

I'm sorry.

08:58.643 --> 09:01.479
It's okay.

09:01.479 --> 09:06.479
-Let's get to the machine.
-Court...

09:06.716 --> 09:09.486
I heard you.

09:09.519 --> 09:13.724
Every word.

09:13.758 --> 09:17.327
I meant every word.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.599
Let's go.

09:21.631 --> 09:24.268
Is he back to normal?

09:24.301 --> 09:28.500
I'm free to slay the dragon.

09:30.149 --> 09:31.708
His normal.

09:31.741 --> 09:34.346
Great job, Beth. Let's go.

09:34.379 --> 09:38.015
It wasn't me, Rick.
It was my best pal, Chuck!

09:38.048 --> 09:43.048
[Dr. Mid-Nite] <i>It was</i>
<i>a team effort, best pal.</i>

09:46.090 --> 09:48.125
[Beth] But we aren't
out of the woods...

09:48.158 --> 09:51.595
Courtney, your mom's still
under Brainwave's control.

09:51.629 --> 09:53.831
And if we don't
destroy that machine,

09:53.865 --> 09:55.866
your mom could still die.

09:55.899 --> 10:00.671
<i>Millions could.</i>

10:00.705 --> 10:03.774
Jordan? The Justice Society,

10:03.807 --> 10:06.878
those kids!

10:06.910 --> 10:09.714
I know, Steven.
They're here.

10:09.746 --> 10:13.683
But, perhaps
it's for the best.

10:13.717 --> 10:15.220
Alert the others.

10:15.253 --> 10:18.322
We'll take care of them,
once and for all.

10:18.355 --> 10:22.192
[Rick] After we take out
this machine,
I'm going after Grundy.

10:22.226 --> 10:25.528
I'm going to rip
that vault door open,
and I'm going to kill him.

10:25.562 --> 10:27.565
You really think
that's gonna help you?

10:27.597 --> 10:29.634
Yeah. I sure as hell do.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.101
Why?

10:31.101 --> 10:33.571
Because I'll know that
that thing won't hurt
anyone else.

10:33.604 --> 10:35.139
It won't make another orphan.

10:35.173 --> 10:38.008
-But killing is wrong.
-Says who?

10:38.008 --> 10:40.244
God?

10:40.244 --> 10:41.211
Yes.

10:41.211 --> 10:44.715
Then God shouldn't let
bad things happen.

10:44.749 --> 10:49.749
Like my parents
being thrown into a tree.

10:51.788 --> 10:56.788
So don't try and stop me,

[Stargirl] Yeah. Everyone okay?

11:28.192 --> 11:30.861
-[Rick] All good.
-[Justin] Aye.

11:30.894 --> 11:32.763
So, where's this machine?

11:32.797 --> 11:35.232
Uh...

11:35.265 --> 11:38.769
According to the map,
it's through there.

11:38.802 --> 11:43.802
[Jordan laughs]
Look what we got here.

11:47.845 --> 11:52.515
That's as far as you go.

11:52.549 --> 11:55.220
No more ice mask, Jordan?

11:55.253 --> 11:57.788
I've got nothing
to hide anymore, Courtney.

11:57.822 --> 12:01.091
[chuckles] Anyone else
have deja vu?

12:01.125 --> 12:04.328
I do.
Wasn't that a fun night?

12:04.361 --> 12:09.361
