03:04.760 --> 03:07.763
Rather fitting, this place.
Don't you think?

03:09.098 --> 03:10.432
Uh...

03:11.499 --> 03:14.402
Sorry, you saw the chains
and "No Entry" signs?

03:15.137 --> 03:18.140
I'm with the BBA.
This building is marked for demolition.

03:21.476 --> 03:22.178
Very dangerous?

03:23.145 --> 03:24.412
Relax, Ryan.

03:24.446 --> 03:27.549
I work for the company too.
Adeline.

03:28.017 --> 03:30.119
You work for the company?
What... What do you do?

03:31.153 --> 03:32.621
Logistics...

03:34.223 --> 03:37.059
Adeline, from logistics?

03:41.964 --> 03:44.767
- Uh, looks like Moe hasn't...
- I have the candidate files.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.434
If you'd like to look?

03:49.671 --> 03:53.676
It's just the three of us
usually.

03:55.144 --> 03:56.979
This is our biggest case yet.

03:57.013 --> 04:00.482
So, I wanted to make sure
everything was perfect.

04:03.485 --> 04:05.487
I wanted to meet you too.

04:08.157 --> 04:09.992
What you did
for our company was...

04:19.534 --> 04:24.173
Speaking? Oh, hi, of course!

04:35.151 --> 04:36.584
Hello?

04:50.833 --> 04:52.534
Are we starting yet?

04:54.203 --> 04:55.137
Hello?

04:56.238 --> 05:00.676
Oh, Ryan, heh, I see
you're eager to get going.

05:00.710 --> 05:04.512
Uh, to answer your question, P,
we'll be starting in just a few minutes.

05:12.154 --> 05:13.022
Everything alright?

05:14.589 --> 05:17.760
Yeah. Can I clear something
up with you?

05:19.128 --> 05:20.196
Of course.

05:23.065 --> 05:24.734
- Maybe?
- Oh, outside!

05:24.767 --> 05:26.135
Uh...

05:26.769 --> 05:27.837
Sit tight, everyone.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.112
What's up?

05:38.314 --> 05:39.849
It's a bit much, isn't it?

05:40.783 --> 05:42.084
What's that now?

05:42.650 --> 05:44.286
It's like Guantanamo in there.

05:45.187 --> 05:49.591
Oh, well, the hoods and chains
are a necessity to this audition.

05:49.624 --> 05:51.659
This client is very specific.

05:52.294 --> 05:57.199
And as we grow as a business,
we need to be more careful.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.002
Adeline's suggestion.

06:00.036 --> 06:01.070
Oh.

06:01.103 --> 06:02.570
You've met her!

06:05.307 --> 06:06.674
I'm set up.

06:11.047 --> 06:14.016
Well, then let's begin.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.094
What?

06:33.803 --> 06:34.804
One's missing.

06:38.808 --> 06:40.076
We know.

06:40.642 --> 06:41.643
Carry on.

06:46.315 --> 06:49.218
Welcome,
to your Criminal Audition.

06:50.753 --> 06:51.854
You can call me William.

06:53.055 --> 06:55.057
This is my right-hand man, Ryan.

06:56.826 --> 06:58.727
And this is Moe.

07:01.363 --> 07:04.666
Ryan will now take DNA samples
from each of you.

07:05.134 --> 07:09.271
Ryan will also assist you in
fitting your own criminal profile.

07:12.441 --> 07:13.809
I'm already a criminal, so...

07:15.244 --> 07:16.812
What?

07:16.846 --> 07:19.181
Take this time
to get to know each other.

07:19.782 --> 07:24.220
To get to know your competition.
What do you all think.

07:26.355 --> 07:28.858
I think, J

07:29.391 --> 07:31.360
will have no problem
fitting a profile.

07:32.461 --> 07:35.231
Now, there's so many ways
I could take that statement,

07:35.264 --> 07:37.299
I don't know whether to be
offended or not.

07:38.868 --> 07:40.836
I think she meant it
to be offensive.

07:46.809 --> 07:49.211
You know, you drive out
prejudices through the door,

07:49.245 --> 07:51.080
and they'll return
through window.

07:51.113 --> 07:52.181
Oh...

07:52.214 --> 07:54.183
So you are educated.

07:54.483 --> 07:56.252
Despite appearances.

07:56.819 --> 07:58.387
That was a compliment!

08:01.757 --> 08:06.295
You are all fine candidates,
and that is why you have made it this far.

08:07.062 --> 08:10.332
What do you think,
being the expert and all?

08:10.366 --> 08:13.135
I think it depends
how far you're willing to go.

08:13.169 --> 08:15.204
Oh, well, she looks like
she'd go all the way!

08:25.181 --> 08:27.249
Well, I think they're
"Getting to know each other".

08:59.515 --> 09:03.752
By morning, one of you
will be our criminal.

09:11.493 --> 09:13.729
"The Brick Lane Burglaries".

09:15.097 --> 09:17.800
"The murder of Alan Guest".

09:19.101 --> 09:22.071
Both crimes solved,
criminals convicted.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.374
Both arranged by us.

09:26.475 --> 09:28.811
Criminals must love you!

09:28.844 --> 09:30.346
Not just criminals...

09:40.222 --> 09:41.790
Hmm?

09:41.824 --> 09:43.058
Oh.

09:47.096 --> 09:48.797
"The Silverman Disappearance."

09:48.831 --> 09:50.833
National news and everything,
huh?

09:50.866 --> 09:53.302
Four years Daisy was missing.

09:54.436 --> 09:58.107
Four years of pain,
for her mother.

09:58.407 --> 10:00.376
Mister Silverman came to us.

10:01.844 --> 10:03.312
He wanted his wife back.

10:04.613 --> 10:08.350
- We gave them closure.
- Amazing!

10:10.452 --> 10:12.454
This is what we do.

10:12.488 --> 10:17.393
These satisfied customers are
willing to pay you handsomely.

10:17.426 --> 10:20.195
- In cash?
- Once you are convicted.

10:20.229 --> 10:23.098
- And how much do you get?
- We take a fee of course.

10:23.132 --> 10:26.368
Now, let's hear Ryan's story.

10:28.370 --> 10:31.507
A criminal, we made earlier.

10:31.540 --> 10:34.310
I confessed
and got manslaughter.

10:35.311 --> 10:36.812
It's not exactly national news.

10:37.379 --> 10:39.148
So that's why you're the expert.

10:39.915 --> 10:41.383
And the money?

10:43.352 --> 10:44.520
Not enough to keep you
from here.

10:45.888 --> 10:48.257
And you didn't even get famous!

10:48.290 --> 10:51.593
Well, Ryan's skills were far
too good to waste.

10:52.294 --> 10:58.600
And if it's fame you're after, this job
tonight, is the one you want to get.

11:01.103 --> 11:02.638
Oh, my days!

11:08.177 --> 11:11.213
This is our crime scene.

11:11.513 --> 11:14.917
Not dissimilar to how we will
stage your eventual crime.

11:15.551 --> 11:18.387
Get to know it, inside out.

11:18.654 --> 11:24.226
You're not just going to be confessing to
a crime, you're going to have to live it.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.631
Was there a struggle?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.402
I was upstairs in the bathroom.

11:35.637 --> 11:38.273
Well, that hardly matches up
with our witness statement.

11:41.110 --> 11:43.345
Look, you really need
to concentrate on the details...

11:43.379 --> 11:45.881
The police know the details.

11:47.216 --> 11:49.184
Tell them your story.

11:49.218 --> 11:53.122
Just make sure you're telling
them and not the other way around.

11:55.491 --> 11:59.528
So, she grabbed you, didn't she?

12:01.530 --> 12:02.931
What happened next?

12:08.437 --> 12:10.472
I couldn't believe
it was happening.

12:11.306 --> 12:12.574
I saw the blood.

12:16.145 --> 12:17.246
That didn't stop me.

12:22.384 --> 12:24.319
it made me want to carry on.

12:31.226 --> 12:34.530
I wanted her to be sorry
for what she did to me.

12:48.444 --> 12:49.578
Is that alright?

12:53.382 --> 12:56.686
We've got one dead,
and another in intensive care.

12:58.153 --> 12:59.588
If he doesn't wake up...

13:05.194 --> 13:06.161
No comment.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.502
You can't just say
"No comment" to everything!

13:13.535 --> 13:15.137
Listen!

13:16.739 --> 13:21.109
If I keep refusing to answer, they're
gonna know I've got something to hide.

13:21.143 --> 13:25.247
Then when I crack,
they'll feel satisfied.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.449
Like they've done their little
police work.

13:36.258 --> 13:38.126
We know you were there that day.

13:39.194 --> 13:42.364
Those thugs
were disrespecting my wife.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.400
So, I slit their throats!

13:47.737 --> 13:50.372
Have you always had
this violent streak?

13:50.405 --> 13:51.573
You bet!

13:51.607 --> 13:55.310
My sociopathic tendencies
are really starting to blossom.

13:55.344 --> 13:59.214
I can't stand people
and their nonsense!

14:00.148 --> 14:03.352
I like to cut through
the bullshit!

14:06.388 --> 14:11.226
You realize you only need to convince
us you can commit one murder.

14:11.260 --> 14:14.663
And you're not a serial killer
who uses puns.

14:15.732 --> 14:17.432
Oh, heh...

14:17.466 --> 14:18.567
I understand.

14:24.306 --> 14:26.743
It's just I thought
you should know

14:27.476 --> 14:32.749
that I took a man's eye out once,
heh, and I ate it in front of him!

14:34.516 --> 14:35.551
Wow.

14:45.294 --> 14:46.361
What do you think of them
so far?

14:47.596 --> 14:50.299
I think they're as desperate
to argue as they are for money.

14:50.332 --> 14:53.569
Oh, well, strong personalities
all around here.

15:04.546 --> 15:07.282
Your missing candidate?

15:14.189 --> 15:18.695
Well, we should greet
our new guest.

15:22.364 --> 15:23.432
You do it.

15:33.442 --> 15:34.376
Moe!

15:35.310 --> 15:36.311
In case.

15:51.259 --> 15:53.562
Please, don't shoot.

15:54.429 --> 15:56.164
- I'm innocent.
- Down.

15:56.198 --> 15:57.332
I'm innocent.

16:11.647 --> 16:14.182
I see you went
with my suggestion.

16:15.517 --> 16:19.554
Oh, yes.
Um, minus the ball gags.

16:19.588 --> 16:20.522
Hmm.

16:22.992 --> 16:26.194
So, they can just chatter away?

16:31.701 --> 16:33.301
Indeed. Um...

16:34.302 --> 16:37.439
- May I introduce you...
- Team talk! Outside!

16:38.473 --> 16:39.408
Of course!

16:44.013 --> 16:46.749
We should make the candidates
comfortable.

16:54.322 --> 16:57.325
I'll go, uh,
see what that's about.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.394
Oi!

16:59.996 --> 17:01.396
Be careful.

17:03.331 --> 17:04.332
Yeah.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.709
It's just, um, rather unorthodox

17:12.742 --> 17:17.012
for the client
to, um, be on the front line.

17:17.046 --> 17:19.314
Uh... As it were, um.

17:19.347 --> 17:21.583
It is my money, isn't it?

17:22.651 --> 17:24.686
And this must be Ryan!

17:24.721 --> 17:27.556
I've heard so much about you.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.726
- Really?
- No, not really.

17:31.460 --> 17:33.562
Are you the reason
we're missing that candidate?

17:33.595 --> 17:37.734
Ryan! Heh, please, we're just
having a little, um...

17:37.767 --> 17:38.667
Yes.

17:40.335 --> 17:43.538
Oh. Well, uh, mystery solved!

17:44.707 --> 17:48.310
I saw your wonderful murder
scene, on the stage in there.

17:48.343 --> 17:51.246
But I prefer a little bit
more realism.

17:55.752 --> 17:58.453
What have you done?

17:59.421 --> 18:02.624
Why don't you go
and find out?

18:08.597 --> 18:09.598
You do it.

18:10.332 --> 18:11.666
Didn't see that coming!

18:14.469 --> 18:18.340
Would you, um,
like a cup of tea?

18:28.550 --> 18:30.052
Something's not right.

18:31.453 --> 18:32.722
I can see!

19:01.383 --> 19:02.752
I love a good jump scare!

19:04.386 --> 19:05.620
Morris!

19:07.023 --> 19:09.759
- You did that.
- Yes! I did that.

19:11.393 --> 19:12.728
And you're with her?

19:13.461 --> 19:16.364
Yes, I'm with her.

19:19.601 --> 19:21.804
We're here to shake things
up a tad.

19:22.805 --> 19:26.108
"Shake things up", how?

19:27.710 --> 19:31.479
If I buy a car,
I like to test drive it.

19:32.081 --> 19:34.717
I want to test drive
those would-be murderers.

19:35.751 --> 19:38.420
I... I mean,
that's exactly what I do, uh.

19:39.155 --> 19:41.123
Nineteen times so far.

19:41.157 --> 19:46.762
I think we both know they haven't
all been so airtight, William.

19:47.562 --> 19:50.800
Heh, I mean, what happens
after convictions is... is not...

19:50.833 --> 19:54.569
I found this,
Secret location quite easily.

19:55.071 --> 19:57.439
Which doesn't fill me
with confidence!

19:58.573 --> 20:02.812
What? Look, this building
will be demolished tomorrow.

20:03.713 --> 20:05.982
No trace of us will be left.

20:06.015 --> 20:07.616
Oh, I don't doubt that.

20:10.485 --> 20:13.555
We're secure.
We're... We're professionals.

20:14.556 --> 20:19.729
If you want to stay then you're...
you're welcome to stay.

20:19.762 --> 20:23.665
But you must let us
carry out our tests.

20:23.699 --> 20:28.637
We have stringent, rigorous
procedures that require the...

20:32.174 --> 20:33.642
You've impressed me.

20:34.677 --> 20:35.610
You're in control.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.750
My assistant
and I will be eager spectators.

20:44.053 --> 20:45.688
Your assistant?

20:45.721 --> 20:46.621
Hmm.

20:47.823 --> 20:49.091
He's here?

20:49.125 --> 20:50.492
Mm-hm.

20:59.601 --> 21:00.836
So, this is safe?

21:03.072 --> 21:03.940
Nope.

21:04.874 --> 21:07.442
- Sorry, what's "No"?
- Not used it before.

21:10.713 --> 21:12.682
So, you don't know
what this will do to them?

21:14.116 --> 21:15.117
Nope.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.088
It could kill them.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.463
So, you lot are in charge?

21:29.165 --> 21:30.232
For now.

21:31.133 --> 21:32.567
Yeah, I think
that'll be for the best.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.602
Heh, okay, yes.

21:36.772 --> 21:40.743
So, what have we here?

21:41.777 --> 21:43.511
A little science experiment?

21:47.216 --> 21:48.217
Only I have a gun.

21:52.755 --> 21:54.656
Man of few words, isn't he?

21:55.791 --> 21:57.793
We're a bit busy, so...

22:12.041 --> 22:13.242
Do you know,
when I was at school,

22:14.642 --> 22:19.547
there was a little tuck shop and
it was full of sticky iced things,

22:19.581 --> 22:21.684
and I planned a midnight raid.

22:23.819 --> 22:28.224
And my brother,
of all people, exposed me.

22:28.257 --> 22:30.558
You might say he grassed me.

22:33.729 --> 22:37.800
And, uh, after
I was suitably punished,

22:39.201 --> 22:42.872
to bury the hatchet, I invited
him to my room for tea.

22:45.274 --> 22:46.641
I tied him up.

22:48.310 --> 22:52.281
And I funneled boiling hot tea,
down his neck.

22:58.087 --> 23:00.056
I burnt his vocal cords
quite badly.

23:04.126 --> 23:06.529
He couldn't tell on me
for quite a while after that.

23:19.674 --> 23:20.776
Come.

23:20.810 --> 23:22.711
Bring headphones.
Stereo's in there.

23:41.663 --> 23:43.799
- What are you doing?
- A test.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.181
Fuck!

24:01.317 --> 24:03.085
Fuck!

24:07.356 --> 24:08.656
Is it working?

24:09.725 --> 24:10.625
Don't know.

24:28.144 --> 24:30.346
You have been given
a potent cocktail.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.250
You are now more susceptible
to telling...

24:34.283 --> 24:35.351
The truth.

24:36.552 --> 24:38.287
These are your possessions
that you brought with you today.

24:39.522 --> 24:42.358
They're the things that you
will most likely take to jail.

24:43.492 --> 24:47.029
They're the items that,
you want to show the world.

24:47.062 --> 24:52.434
However, we've acquired a few you
may not want to show the world.

24:56.305 --> 24:57.672
You've been in our homes!

24:58.340 --> 25:00.709
You better not have raided
my fridge!

25:04.180 --> 25:07.216
Please.
Have a rummage.

25:21.797 --> 25:23.866
Hmm. And what is that, L?

25:23.899 --> 25:25.334
It's a certificate.

25:27.803 --> 25:29.338
Volunteer work.

25:33.342 --> 25:34.376
Signed by the mayor!

25:37.846 --> 25:39.748
Jesus, P!

25:39.782 --> 25:43.185
What can I say?
I'm a high achiever.

25:43.219 --> 25:46.288
I aim. I have a mortgage!

25:47.256 --> 25:51.060
My wife always says to me,
"Preston, you..."

25:51.093 --> 25:54.129
"P" for Preston!

25:56.265 --> 25:57.399
Wait.

25:58.667 --> 26:02.471
Wait, why have you all got code
names and I've just got my name?

26:02.504 --> 26:06.809
Is "J" for "J", spelt "J"!

26:06.842 --> 26:09.211
Yeah, J.

26:10.813 --> 26:13.182
"J", yeah!

26:13.215 --> 26:18.887
P? P! You're a selfless man,
known in your community for doing good.

26:19.822 --> 26:24.493
I don't think you quite appreciate just
how much you'll affect others around you.

26:25.294 --> 26:29.765
Hmm, your wife, for example.
The media will hound her.

26:30.299 --> 26:32.268
Her life will never
be the same again.

26:33.335 --> 26:34.503
They'll make you into a monster.

26:36.238 --> 26:38.107
They'll find you innocent.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.809
They won't even press charges,
you're practically a saint.

26:40.843 --> 26:42.511
Uh... Listen!

26:43.445 --> 26:45.281
I'm the prime candidate here.

26:46.548 --> 26:48.384
I'm an accountant!

26:48.417 --> 26:52.054
Saint Matthew,
patron saint of the accounts!

26:52.087 --> 26:55.357
Which means, I have an eye
for meticulous detail!

26:55.391 --> 26:57.559
Listen, you fucking peanut!

26:59.094 --> 27:00.429
This is bullshit!

27:00.462 --> 27:04.233
Before he was an apostle,
he was a tax collector in Capernaum!

27:04.266 --> 27:10.572
Is anyone going to ask Preston,
why he wants to do this?

27:11.373 --> 27:13.809
I was getting there. Hmm.

27:14.910 --> 27:18.247
Preston,
why do you want to do this?

27:18.614 --> 27:21.350
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Ms...

27:21.383 --> 27:23.819
Miss M.

27:26.522 --> 27:31.126
And what do you do here, Miss M?

27:31.393 --> 27:35.597
I tell you, to get on with it!

27:48.243 --> 27:49.912
I want to be a criminal.

27:51.513 --> 27:54.550
I'm tired of the monotony
of my life.

27:54.583 --> 27:59.855
The nine-to-five, the expectation
that I'll always do the right thing.

28:00.589 --> 28:03.525
I've always done what's right.

28:04.426 --> 28:06.895
- And now, I want to be...
- Wrong?

28:08.698 --> 28:11.433
L, look in his box.

28:12.534 --> 28:13.869
Any books in there?

28:14.303 --> 28:17.206
Yeah, they're all about...

28:17.239 --> 28:21.577
About serial killers.
Organized crime.

28:21.610 --> 28:24.646
- Well, they are to learn!
- Murder porn!

28:24.681 --> 28:26.148
Uh...

28:26.181 --> 28:29.918
Oh. You're a fantasist.

28:31.353 --> 28:34.123
A criminal tourist.

28:36.358 --> 28:40.929
Assure you,
I'm not here for a holiday.

28:41.698 --> 28:43.232
We'll see!

28:56.512 --> 28:58.247
Let's move on!

29:02.217 --> 29:03.285
We have an idea.

29:10.259 --> 29:11.560
You're giving them more?

29:14.229 --> 29:16.699
The situation is unique.

29:17.433 --> 29:19.435
We should show off a bit.

29:20.269 --> 29:21.437
For her.

29:21.470 --> 29:26.408
Plus, we need to push the
envelope with our techniques.

29:27.476 --> 29:31.180
And overdosing
is a technique, is it?

29:33.683 --> 29:35.150
Moe says it's safe.

29:36.686 --> 29:38.153
It's safe.

29:40.489 --> 29:44.526
- This client...
- Is our most prestigious yet!

29:46.161 --> 29:48.230
We could go international here.

29:49.465 --> 29:51.400
She's dangerous.

29:52.334 --> 29:57.406
Ryan, I've always considered you
a founding member of this company.

29:57.439 --> 30:02.177
And you too could become
a part of this expansion.

30:03.278 --> 30:06.315
Seems more like
escalation to me.

30:07.216 --> 30:09.719
This is what
we've been building to.

30:10.753 --> 30:12.722
Let's nail this one!

30:20.462 --> 30:21.530
It's not safe.

30:22.531 --> 30:23.700
Fuck!

30:26.401 --> 30:29.171
- Fucking.
- Fucking.

30:45.420 --> 30:46.522
L?

30:51.159 --> 30:52.561
J asked you a question.

30:56.465 --> 30:59.334
I... I said, is...
is this your diary?

31:05.407 --> 31:06.542
Yes.

31:11.681 --> 31:13.582
Had fun reading it, did you?

31:20.155 --> 31:23.492
Well, I suppose you haven't
updated it yet today,

31:24.259 --> 31:28.297
confessed how much you want
to sit on my face!

31:32.301 --> 31:34.436
I only write to my child in it.

31:37.573 --> 31:42.277
You have a child,
and you want to get locked up?

31:42.311 --> 31:45.748
Fuck the do-gooder
and fuck that little pervert!

31:52.487 --> 31:54.356
She got taken away from me.

31:59.561 --> 32:00.562
So...

32:03.398 --> 32:10.272
do you want a desperate mother,
a do-gooder or a perv?

32:15.577 --> 32:17.512
When your daughter grows up

32:19.514 --> 32:21.583
is she going to come
looking for her mother?

32:26.355 --> 32:27.522
Is she going to find a murderer?

32:31.493 --> 32:33.261
She won't want to find me.

32:33.295 --> 32:36.298
- You'll never see her.
- I never do!

32:36.331 --> 32:39.601
I'm just here
for the fucking money!

32:49.211 --> 32:53.582
Okay, so, J, maybe we could,
um...

32:54.416 --> 32:55.450
Uh...

32:55.985 --> 32:58.688
L, carry on?

33:03.325 --> 33:05.527
Must be difficult for you.

33:08.296 --> 33:11.633
You've been through this,
made your money.

33:16.505 --> 33:18.240
Now you work for them.

33:23.512 --> 33:26.314
You're not pretending
to be a criminal.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.756
You are one.

33:48.805 --> 33:51.206
Let's take a break!

33:53.676 --> 33:56.713
Yeah, come on,
come on, come on, come one!

34:11.460 --> 34:15.297
So, my desperate little pieces
of meat.

34:19.735 --> 34:21.603
Who wants to play a little game?

35:02.678 --> 35:05.580
Who wants to phone a loved one
and tell them what they've done?

35:05.614 --> 35:08.617
- What they're about to do!
- Indeed!

35:09.351 --> 35:12.688
Uh, we're quite strict about, uh,
contact with the outside world...

35:12.722 --> 35:16.726
And I'm quite strict about you
interrupting my assistant.

35:26.468 --> 35:30.639
Who are you going to confess to,
hmm?

35:31.573 --> 35:36.578
Who are you going to convince that
you're as worthless as I know you are?

35:36.611 --> 35:37.612
I could phone my wife?

35:38.748 --> 35:40.615
It would be
the ultimate sacrifice!

35:40.649 --> 35:42.084
Look at me!

35:48.724 --> 35:50.059
I'll do it.

35:53.062 --> 35:55.031
Who would receive
the phone call though?

35:55.630 --> 35:57.967
What, your social worker?

35:58.000 --> 36:01.603
Your, absent, presumably
estranged father?

36:03.572 --> 36:04.606
My mum.

36:09.578 --> 36:10.980
Dial away!

36:11.013 --> 36:13.582
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

36:14.750 --> 36:17.452
They have taken loads of drugs.

36:17.485 --> 36:18.955
Now, we don't know
what he's going to say,

36:18.988 --> 36:22.792
he could give up the location,
he could say... he could say your names!

36:22.825 --> 36:25.127
Because my name's really Morris.

36:25.161 --> 36:28.764
And that's William,
and that's Moe.

36:30.498 --> 36:31.633
I'm Moe.

36:34.036 --> 36:35.037
Sure!

36:54.757 --> 36:56.125
It's J, Mum.

36:58.493 --> 37:00.763
Heh. Nah, nah, I didn't nick it.

37:03.665 --> 37:05.034
Uh, Mum.

37:06.235 --> 37:07.803
Mum. Mum!

37:08.536 --> 37:09.705
Shut up.

37:13.475 --> 37:14.509
Um...

37:16.779 --> 37:18.480
I've really fucked up.

37:21.150 --> 37:24.619
There's no getting out of this,
Mum, I've really fucked up.

37:34.030 --> 37:34.897
I killed someone.

37:40.770 --> 37:41.804
Mum?

37:44.606 --> 37:49.145
I mean, uh, he's dead,
and I did it.

37:51.579 --> 37:54.784
I... I dunno... I dunno what I
was thinking, it was an accident,

37:54.817 --> 37:57.720
but I... I just... I lost it.
I got so angry! I...

37:58.721 --> 38:01.123
I've got to go, Mum,
I'll see you soon, yeah?

38:01.157 --> 38:02.992
<i>J? What are you talking about?</i>

38:03.025 --> 38:04.592
<i>Are you still there?
J, please, talk...</i>

38:26.215 --> 38:27.717
Well done, chap.

38:38.194 --> 38:40.229
And what did we learn from that?

38:41.197 --> 38:43.099
That the boy can lie.

38:43.766 --> 38:45.533
Now, let's see if he's a killer.

38:47.635 --> 38:50.139
I believe we discussed that
as a very last resort.

38:50.172 --> 38:53.109
This is a last resort!

39:28.177 --> 39:30.179
I think they're going to hurt
these people.

39:32.314 --> 39:33.682
Just do as I say.

39:36.618 --> 39:38.087
As per usual.

39:40.356 --> 39:43.159
They have someone...

39:44.160 --> 39:45.327
Someone?

39:46.796 --> 39:48.864
Someone close to me.

39:52.201 --> 39:53.702
So, we have no choice.

39:55.670 --> 39:56.705
No.

40:00.142 --> 40:01.609
No choice?

40:04.180 --> 40:05.314
That's familiar.

40:07.116 --> 40:09.351
Look, just let her get on
with it.

40:11.187 --> 40:12.121
We're in control.

40:25.367 --> 40:28.670
I want to see
how far you'll go.

40:30.072 --> 40:36.846
You have a front row seat to
your competitors rise or fall.

40:39.315 --> 40:40.716
Let's begin.

40:43.352 --> 40:45.221
J, you're first.

40:46.188 --> 40:47.223
Pick a weapon.

41:19.355 --> 41:24.260
Well, you want to play the part of
a criminal, start acting like one!

41:40.876 --> 41:43.846
You know, torture's proven
to not yield results?

41:44.446 --> 41:47.850
Oh, I don't require
any information from him.

41:51.420 --> 41:53.322
Just want me to hurt him?

42:21.483 --> 42:24.386
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are
you doing? What are you doing?

42:24.420 --> 42:25.387
No!

42:35.397 --> 42:36.732
Fuck!

42:51.513 --> 42:54.416
Uh... I mean, bravo!

43:04.526 --> 43:06.228
Come on, man.

43:15.604 --> 43:17.273
Come on, man!

43:20.542 --> 43:23.112
What's taking so long?

43:24.246 --> 43:28.183
There's just so many options,
heh.

43:28.917 --> 43:30.819
I can't decide
how to torture him!

43:32.488 --> 43:39.361
Well, from one enthusiast
to another,

43:40.496 --> 43:44.233
I'd bash his head in with this.

43:46.535 --> 43:48.170
I... Interesting.

43:50.172 --> 43:51.273
Do it.

44:25.240 --> 44:26.342
I can't.

45:17.393 --> 45:18.494
Now.

45:23.298 --> 45:29.538
You may think I love being right
and I do! Heh.

45:32.241 --> 45:38.180
But I wasn't right,
not this time.

45:39.381 --> 45:41.450
I didn't think
he'd get this far.

45:45.287 --> 45:46.522
He failed!

45:48.590 --> 45:50.392
This is your mess.

45:52.327 --> 45:53.495
Clear it up!

46:30.666 --> 46:32.267
Are we quite done?

46:33.302 --> 46:35.337
- I'm eating!
- We need to talk about...

46:35.370 --> 46:38.340
We'd like to discuss...

46:41.678 --> 46:45.214
the incident that just occurred.

46:45.247 --> 46:47.416
Yeah, you remember that,
when you just killed someone?

46:47.449 --> 46:48.550
Do you?

46:50.687 --> 46:52.421
Have you cleared up the mess?

46:53.422 --> 46:55.657
Moe is dealing with it.

46:55.692 --> 46:58.160
Not clearing up your own mess.

46:58.494 --> 47:02.564
No. Keeping your messes around!

47:03.265 --> 47:04.433
What have I got to do with this?

47:04.466 --> 47:05.802
We're talking
about what you have done!

47:05.835 --> 47:11.340
With the greatest respect,
I have crafted this process carefully,

47:11.373 --> 47:12.709
over a number of years!

47:12.742 --> 47:16.478
Do you seriously think any of
those people could go far enough?

47:17.279 --> 47:20.449
We fabricate evidence.
We fix juries.

47:20.482 --> 47:25.220
This... These things take time
and a light touch!

47:25.254 --> 47:31.627
You told me you had plenty of eligible
candidates, perfect for my murder.

47:34.296 --> 47:35.430
We have.

47:36.632 --> 47:37.967
It takes, uh, skill to find
what's special in these...

47:38.001 --> 47:43.740
And you agreed I could eliminate
those I didn't think would fit.

47:45.541 --> 47:48.277
Sorry. Sorry, what is this?
What have you agreed to?

47:48.310 --> 47:49.645
- What have you agreed to?
- I agreed to...

47:49.679 --> 47:51.213
He agreed to that.

47:56.618 --> 48:01.323
Let me show you,
with my next task.

48:09.631 --> 48:11.533
We have things to discuss.

48:14.469 --> 48:15.705
I've got this.

48:59.314 --> 49:00.783
She's going to kill one of us,
isn't she?

49:05.587 --> 49:06.689
I don't know.

49:11.728 --> 49:14.296
Never met the client in my case.

49:15.765 --> 49:16.699
Hmm.

49:20.703 --> 49:25.574
Not sure I like the idea of
knowing who I'm going to become.

49:30.212 --> 49:32.214
You don't have to do this,
you know?

49:35.517 --> 49:37.185
I can get you out of here.

49:42.725 --> 49:45.227
Thought you were meant
to help us be criminals.

49:53.435 --> 49:54.469
Not cowards.

49:59.776 --> 50:01.243
I'm going to win.

50:02.611 --> 50:03.545
Sorry.

50:05.715 --> 50:07.182
Don't be.

50:08.718 --> 50:10.452
Because I'm winning already.

50:12.789 --> 50:14.356
Right, well...

50:15.992 --> 50:17.694
I'm going to go check on B,

50:19.461 --> 50:22.364
make sure he's not dead.

50:26.002 --> 50:27.202
Who's B?

50:28.503 --> 50:30.605
Sorry,
you ripped his finger off?

50:34.376 --> 50:35.778
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

50:53.730 --> 50:55.698
They want him for the next task.

50:57.599 --> 51:00.602
I had to feed him.
He needs strength.

51:01.336 --> 51:02.671
We shouldn't just be
feeding him.

51:02.705 --> 51:04.406
We should be getting him
out of here.

51:04.439 --> 51:05.474
No!

51:06.776 --> 51:10.012
Oh, I'm sorry! You...
you wanted another corpse for your table?

51:11.346 --> 51:13.482
I don't care about these people.

51:14.382 --> 51:15.718
I don't care about you.

51:17.086 --> 51:19.722
- You should be like me.
- Why?

51:21.490 --> 51:22.725
You'll stay alive!

51:30.733 --> 51:32.001
Yeah.

51:32.501 --> 51:35.705
Yeah, um, you're right,
you're right.

51:35.738 --> 51:37.707
Uh... Ahem.

51:37.740 --> 51:39.608
I'll get him in.

51:41.643 --> 51:42.779
Keep it hidden.

51:47.049 --> 51:48.416
Okay.

51:56.759 --> 51:58.761
Always have a back-up plan.

52:23.853 --> 52:27.757
Ryan! Please, take your usual place
for the question and answer session.

52:27.790 --> 52:29.792
I'm really looking forward
to this.

52:33.095 --> 52:34.096
Yeah.

52:37.700 --> 52:44.372
You sacrificed years of your
life, and a murderer went free.

52:46.709 --> 52:48.110
Tell the tale.

52:51.613 --> 52:56.351
So, when you're chosen, uh,

52:57.452 --> 53:00.723
phone calls are put in,
evidence planted

53:00.756 --> 53:02.557
and... and it's not long
before the police...

53:02.591 --> 53:09.098
Yes, yes. We know the details,
tell us the human story.

53:09.765 --> 53:12.034
Do you regret doing it, Ryan?

53:17.039 --> 53:23.378
Oh, sorry, the, heh, old
building, it'll be on again in a minute.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.156
How was the victim killed?

53:38.660 --> 53:40.462
It's a small detail, I don't...

53:40.495 --> 53:45.067
Overdosed with sedatives
and then, brutally beaten.

53:46.035 --> 53:49.638
Beaten and stabbed, after death
had already occurred.

53:54.043 --> 53:57.512
An overdose, we all know
what that is, technically.

53:57.813 --> 54:03.719
An ingestion of drugs in excess.
Excess that leads to death.

54:06.188 --> 54:07.990
No, no, no, no, no, no...

54:22.204 --> 54:23.538
Just like that.

54:29.644 --> 54:30.578
Stop it.

54:43.859 --> 54:46.528
Get up, get up!

54:51.167 --> 54:56.005
What an overdose is really is
a very weak way to kill someone.

54:56.038 --> 54:57.039
Please.

54:58.040 --> 55:02.178
Please, I told
you, I have a family!

55:03.779 --> 55:06.614
Morris. Morris!

55:10.319 --> 55:11.153
You don't have to do this!

55:11.187 --> 55:15.590
As weak,
as your attempt to save him!

55:15.623 --> 55:18.227
Now, Ryan, you're a criminal,

55:21.063 --> 55:22.231
you should watch this.

55:22.765 --> 55:23.866
You don't have to do this.

55:30.139 --> 55:31.573
You should too.

56:33.668 --> 56:36.205
The drugs would have
killed him eventually.

56:39.175 --> 56:41.744
Now, we couldn't have him
running around free.

56:45.347 --> 56:47.216
I had to strangle him.

56:53.289 --> 56:55.157
Always have a back-up plan.

57:18.681 --> 57:19.748
Well!

57:21.083 --> 57:25.087
Let's move on.
Two candidates left!

57:38.801 --> 57:40.369
I only just finished
that one!

57:43.806 --> 57:45.841
This may be getting out of hand.

57:53.716 --> 57:54.750
"May."

57:58.187 --> 58:00.055
Ryan, I have always been
very clear...

58:00.089 --> 58:01.423
You exploited them.

58:03.292 --> 58:04.693
Alive or dead.

58:06.395 --> 58:07.763
You did that with me.

58:12.501 --> 58:14.669
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that.

58:15.504 --> 58:20.176
Have you asked yourself,
why they are treating this like a game?

58:20.209 --> 58:22.845
I kept you off the streets!

58:23.212 --> 58:28.851
This one, beaten,
drugged, strangled.

58:30.486 --> 58:32.221
This one bludgeoned to death.

58:40.196 --> 58:42.064
This isn't a typical place
of work, Ryan.

58:42.097 --> 58:43.799
They're from the criminal world.

58:45.501 --> 58:48.837
You realize you are
from that world too, right?

58:52.408 --> 58:54.777
They are playing you.

58:57.813 --> 59:00.149
I provide them with a service.

59:00.849 --> 59:03.152
They need me
more than I need them.

59:03.185 --> 59:07.122
Yeah, heh, I'm going to tell you now,
it doesn't seem that way out there tonight.

59:07.156 --> 59:11.327
They need my help.
That's why they're here.

59:15.164 --> 59:16.732
Maybe they like what you do.

59:19.201 --> 59:23.505
Have you ever considered
you may be auditioning yourself?

59:31.247 --> 59:32.381
What do you want me to do?

59:35.251 --> 59:36.452
He has a gun.

59:39.855 --> 59:41.290
He has a gun!

59:46.228 --> 59:47.396
We have control.

59:50.566 --> 59:54.503
They've been doing just fine
without their bullets.

59:57.539 --> 01:00:00.175
They want to see you
in the interrogation room.

01:00:01.477 --> 01:00:02.411
Why?

01:00:05.114 --> 01:00:06.382
To interrogate you.

01:00:08.384 --> 01:00:09.351
Chop, chop!

01:00:23.165 --> 01:00:24.233
What's this?

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.810
You fucking me, or him?

01:00:38.614 --> 01:00:39.548
Him.

01:00:44.586 --> 01:00:45.554
Okay.

01:00:50.326 --> 01:00:51.560
I have to do this.

01:00:57.466 --> 01:00:58.467
I know.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.241
Okay.

01:01:15.384 --> 01:01:16.585
Do I scare you?

01:01:19.488 --> 01:01:21.123
Why do they have to die?

01:01:22.424 --> 01:01:25.327
You work towards
facilitating murder.

01:01:25.361 --> 01:01:28.163
Don't pretend
we aren't all in this together!

01:01:28.497 --> 01:01:32.134
Not to mention
your past indiscretion.

01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:35.270
My past has nothing to do
with this.

01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:38.273
Why are you here?

01:01:39.441 --> 01:01:40.943
I was keen to meet you.

01:01:42.511 --> 01:01:43.645
Isn't everybody?

01:01:46.248 --> 01:01:47.583
How did he find you?

01:01:50.386 --> 01:01:52.421
Same way he finds everybody.

01:01:53.389 --> 01:01:55.290
He's a bottom drawer lawyer.

01:01:58.728 --> 01:02:00.429
Represents the poor

01:02:02.331 --> 01:02:03.465
and our little troubles.

01:02:10.139 --> 01:02:13.108
He becomes a friend
you can rely on and,

01:02:13.142 --> 01:02:17.646
once you or your family suffer,
many indiscretions,

01:02:20.582 --> 01:02:22.418
he offers you alternatives.

01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:24.219
Alternatives?

01:02:25.554 --> 01:02:27.222
Ultimatums.

01:02:31.427 --> 01:02:34.596
You're not scared of me,
are you?

01:02:36.265 --> 01:02:38.634
Well, not yet.

01:03:14.136 --> 01:03:15.204
Sit there!

01:03:16.138 --> 01:03:17.306
You'll pick the winner.

01:03:20.142 --> 01:03:21.643
Whether you like it or not.

01:03:25.614 --> 01:03:26.749
A new test.

01:03:27.684 --> 01:03:31.553
How would you dispose
of this corpse?

01:03:33.555 --> 01:03:35.692
And you're trying not to get
caught, remember?

01:03:42.397 --> 01:03:45.667
Whoever gives me
the worst answer, dies.

01:03:50.405 --> 01:03:51.573
And begin.

01:03:57.179 --> 01:03:58.547
Auto-erotic asphyxiation?

01:04:04.419 --> 01:04:05.688
What?

01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:08.691
Well, strangling himself
whilst he's having a wank.

01:04:09.424 --> 01:04:10.559
Fits in to what he did.

01:04:13.562 --> 01:04:16.766
Well, because of what he did,
he's got drugs in his system too.

01:04:18.333 --> 01:04:20.602
I'd leave him under a canal bridge,
he'd look like your everyday...

01:04:20.636 --> 01:04:21.570
Addict.

01:04:21.603 --> 01:04:24.673
Nah. Nah, nah, nah.
He had cuts and bruises.

01:04:25.374 --> 01:04:27.175
There's obvious foul play.

01:04:30.279 --> 01:04:33.282
Then he couldn't have
wanked himself to death either!

01:04:35.551 --> 01:04:37.653
Then let's leave
no trace of him then.

01:04:37.687 --> 01:04:39.187
How?

01:04:39.221 --> 01:04:41.290
- Throw him in the sea.
- Yeah, right.

01:04:41.323 --> 01:04:44.126
Anywhere there's a high level
of Oxygen in the water,

01:04:44.159 --> 01:04:45.394
there's a high level
of sea fauna.

01:04:45.427 --> 01:04:47.362
He'll be consumed very quickly.

01:04:48.765 --> 01:04:51.266
Hmm, very good, J!

01:04:52.501 --> 01:04:55.537
Ryan, who will it be?

01:05:03.612 --> 01:05:05.782
L, or J?

01:05:14.691 --> 01:05:15.758
No, Ryan!

01:05:17.694 --> 01:05:20.295
He won, fair and square.

01:05:24.299 --> 01:05:26.501
Actually, kill J instead.

01:05:27.704 --> 01:05:29.271
What?

01:05:54.396 --> 01:05:57.165
Didn't think
you'd try and rescue him.

01:05:57.967 --> 01:06:00.168
He's not as cute, is he?

01:06:07.476 --> 01:06:08.678
I need a piss.

01:06:34.469 --> 01:06:36.471
I've pissed in worse places.

01:06:38.373 --> 01:06:39.274
Really?

01:06:41.476 --> 01:06:43.780
In a bucket after I've just
watched a kid get stabbed?

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.683
Much worse!

01:06:55.024 --> 01:06:56.358
It's not because I'm nervous.

01:06:57.559 --> 01:06:58.728
What?

01:06:59.996 --> 01:07:01.296
The shakes.

01:07:05.034 --> 01:07:06.234
I know.

01:07:07.335 --> 01:07:08.470
Uh...

01:07:14.342 --> 01:07:16.211
Stole it from Morris.

01:07:30.993 --> 01:07:31.861
Thanks.

01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:35.330
And turn around.

01:07:36.733 --> 01:07:38.500
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:07:53.482 --> 01:07:54.583
Lydia.

01:07:57.352 --> 01:07:58.353
What?

01:07:59.521 --> 01:08:00.489
My name.

01:08:02.058 --> 01:08:03.325
Oh, um...

01:08:04.593 --> 01:08:05.728
Yeah, I know.

01:08:07.596 --> 01:08:08.530
Oh.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:15.004
So, now we're partners in crime are you
going to tell me how you ended up here?

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.008
Well...

01:08:20.042 --> 01:08:22.812
- William found...
- Nah, how you really got here?

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:29.752
I made some mistakes.

01:08:39.028 --> 01:08:40.062
Like you.

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:44.666
So, if I'm you, years ago.

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.769
What would you say to yourself
back then?

01:08:52.008 --> 01:08:54.509
That you have so much more worth
than you think.

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:03.085
Are you saying that to you,
or me?

01:09:08.024 --> 01:09:10.358
Don't overestimate me, Ryan.

01:09:12.493 --> 01:09:14.029
I've messed up a lot of lives.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:19.533
Not just my daughter's,
and not just mine.

01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:30.680
Um... We should go back in.

01:09:33.515 --> 01:09:38.386
crime,
it does pay, apparently.

01:10:06.015 --> 01:10:10.518
So, Lydia is our criminal.

01:10:12.221 --> 01:10:16.058
I want to exercise Option B.

01:10:23.032 --> 01:10:24.066
But, Lydia's alive,

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.468
- that was more of a...
- It's more money for you!

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:29.671
What is option B?

01:10:42.718 --> 01:10:47.056
You really think I would want
to go through all that again?

01:10:47.555 --> 01:10:50.760
I was curious as to why
you stayed all these years.

01:10:50.793 --> 01:10:52.494
Do you want to chime in on this,
or?

01:10:52.527 --> 01:10:54.030
Mm-mm. Mm.

01:10:54.063 --> 01:10:59.135
Unless you're a successful
candidate, you're a dead candidate.

01:11:00.836 --> 01:11:02.537
You agreed to this.

01:11:04.572 --> 01:11:05.640
For more money?

01:11:06.742 --> 01:11:09.511
Oh, it was his idea. Wasn't it?

01:11:09.544 --> 01:11:11.646
Oh, he was very enthusiastic.

01:11:12.748 --> 01:11:16.618
Please say you agreed to this

01:11:16.651 --> 01:11:21.090
after you found out
they had someone close to you.

01:11:23.525 --> 01:11:24.592
Tell him!

01:11:29.165 --> 01:11:33.169
It was before, okay? But, look,
they needed someone great, I had to put...

01:11:33.202 --> 01:11:37.472
As I understand it, we have
everything we need from you.

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:41.043
DNA, personality profile,

01:11:42.778 --> 01:11:44.479
criminal record.

01:11:45.314 --> 01:11:48.184
Everything we need to make you
the perfect candidate.

01:11:50.618 --> 01:11:53.222
Look, Lydia is just as good,

01:11:53.255 --> 01:11:55.825
- you saw how well she performed!
- My decision is final.

01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:03.531
Come on!
We had a deal, a deal is a deal!

01:12:04.166 --> 01:12:06.568
What a pathetic man
you really are!

01:12:06.601 --> 01:12:09.205
You fucking think I'm just going
to allow this to happen?

01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:19.048
<i>Have you ever considered,
you may be auditioning yourself?</i>

01:12:19.081 --> 01:12:23.152
<i>You're not pretending
to be a criminal, you are one.</i>

01:12:23.185 --> 01:12:24.754
<i>We're here
to shake things up a tad.</i>

01:12:25.287 --> 01:12:28.090
<i>You're not scared of me,
are you?</i>

01:12:28.656 --> 01:12:30.693
<i>Well, not yet.</i>

01:12:32.361 --> 01:12:36.265
Okay, so, where is she?

01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:40.736
We need to see this
through first.

01:12:41.137 --> 01:12:44.040
Come on! Look, I've been
more than accommodating!

01:12:44.073 --> 01:12:47.575
You've been playing this sick game, "Oh, I
want this person, no, I want that person."

01:12:47.609 --> 01:12:50.146
Well, you know, I...
I'm sick of it! Fuck it!

01:12:50.179 --> 01:12:51.714
Do what you want,
kill who you like, I don't care!

01:12:51.747 --> 01:12:53.349
Just where is she?

01:12:53.382 --> 01:12:57.319
You know, how I know I can
respect someone, William?

01:12:58.254 --> 01:13:03.092
I judge them, on how well they
protect what belongs to them,

01:13:03.125 --> 01:13:05.327
who belongs to them.

01:13:06.796 --> 01:13:12.634
You allowed me complete access to
your so-called secure organization,

01:13:12.667 --> 01:13:15.304
your water-tight procedure.

01:13:15.337 --> 01:13:18.207
Your secret location.

01:13:18.841 --> 01:13:22.644
And all for what, money?

01:13:22.678 --> 01:13:24.046
No!

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.248
Who the fuck rattled your cage?

01:13:26.282 --> 01:13:30.086
William, can't let them do this.

01:13:30.119 --> 01:13:31.619
Use your words.

01:13:32.288 --> 01:13:34.123
I took the bullets out your gun.

01:13:37.793 --> 01:13:39.061
Ah. Look!

01:13:49.071 --> 01:13:50.638
He nearly had me there!

01:13:55.344 --> 01:13:58.613
Now, we have something
to show you.

01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.698
You're not dead then?

01:14:19.468 --> 01:14:20.736
No.

01:14:33.282 --> 01:14:34.383
Shit.

01:14:36.218 --> 01:14:39.088
The tweed psycho brought them
in with you. What are they?

01:14:40.256 --> 01:14:41.223
Tapes.

01:14:42.491 --> 01:14:43.726
Yeah!

01:14:44.493 --> 01:14:46.128
Of what we do here.

01:14:47.496 --> 01:14:49.198
I was so close.

01:14:50.833 --> 01:14:51.867
To what?

01:14:56.805 --> 01:14:58.274
My family

01:14:59.742 --> 01:15:04.079
were under
big financial problems.

01:15:07.216 --> 01:15:10.152
And William offered us
a solution.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:13.155
He got us all on board.

01:15:14.323 --> 01:15:15.457
They know you're innocent.

01:15:23.265 --> 01:15:27.369
So, they just got rich
and disowned you?

01:15:28.237 --> 01:15:31.373
And then William
was all I had left,

01:15:31.407 --> 01:15:35.411
and he was there
to pick up the pieces.

01:15:36.245 --> 01:15:39.348
And what about the... the tapes?

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:48.791
Try and make sure no one else
ever goes through this again.

01:15:52.795 --> 01:15:53.829
Thanks!

01:15:54.363 --> 01:15:55.497
What for?

01:15:58.367 --> 01:16:00.436
For looking out for me tonight.

01:16:06.175 --> 01:16:07.276
We're fucked!

01:16:29.164 --> 01:16:31.267
Don't you want to know
who it is?

01:16:33.902 --> 01:16:35.104
Go on!

01:17:01.397 --> 01:17:02.498
Hello, darling.

01:17:04.366 --> 01:17:05.868
Get in the chair!

01:17:06.402 --> 01:17:07.870
Do you know who this is?

01:17:13.442 --> 01:17:14.843
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:17:16.178 --> 01:17:18.380
This is the person
that you confessed to killing.

01:17:20.516 --> 01:17:26.588
I thought I had justice for my sister,
that the right man had been caught.

01:17:27.656 --> 01:17:34.263
I waited for Ryan's pitiful sentence
to end, so that I could kill him.

01:17:35.197 --> 01:17:37.266
And then I learned the truth.

01:17:40.135 --> 01:17:41.870
She was Ms. M's sister.

01:17:43.272 --> 01:17:44.540
She was a very...

01:17:49.178 --> 01:17:51.113
She was a very dear friend
of mine.

01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:57.519
- So, this is revenge then.
- Yeah.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.289
This sick and twisted system

01:18:01.256 --> 01:18:05.494
let's despicable people
escape justice.

01:18:06.395 --> 01:18:07.429
Period.

01:18:13.268 --> 01:18:17.106
It's interesting
because I seem to remember

01:18:17.139 --> 01:18:20.342
you brutally murdering
four people tonight, so...

01:18:20.376 --> 01:18:21.410
Yeah.

01:18:23.445 --> 01:18:27.316
Did you ever just stop
and think, maybe, just maybe,

01:18:30.119 --> 01:18:31.320
we weren't the bad guys?

01:18:36.693 --> 01:18:38.160
Get up!

01:18:40.562 --> 01:18:43.632
I knew it was too good to true,
the money the connections.

01:18:43.665 --> 01:18:46.703
- I made a good deal!
- We got careless!

01:18:46.736 --> 01:18:51.407
You know, I thought I'd be
destroying some vast network.

01:18:52.274 --> 01:18:57.346
Some shadowy company fixing
things for the rich and worthy.

01:18:58.447 --> 01:19:00.549
Imagine my shock,

01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:07.389
when I discover this well-to-do
suburban couple.

01:19:07.423 --> 01:19:11.593
And that you, killed my sister!

01:19:11.627 --> 01:19:13.562
I'm truly sorry for what
happened to your sister.

01:19:13.595 --> 01:19:15.197
But I was put into a position.

01:19:16.598 --> 01:19:18.467
Please, don't get me wrong.

01:19:19.301 --> 01:19:22.204
I admire what you two created.

01:19:22.671 --> 01:19:24.206
You fooled me.

01:19:25.274 --> 01:19:26.575
You fooled the world.

01:19:27.409 --> 01:19:28.177
Wait!

01:19:29.144 --> 01:19:31.113
It is a great thing,
I've created.

01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:36.385
So why destroy it? Be a partner.
With your power and influence

01:19:36.418 --> 01:19:38.688
- we could achieve so much.
- Exactly!

01:19:38.721 --> 01:19:43.258
You're key to making this
good thing, great!

01:19:44.493 --> 01:19:46.161
Remarkable.

01:19:46.696 --> 01:19:51.300
How you both haven't worked out
what kind of person I truly am.

01:19:55.337 --> 01:20:00.209
Now, as you did so well,

01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:05.180
we've decided that
you've won a...

01:20:16.425 --> 01:20:17.593
quick death.

01:20:19.461 --> 01:20:21.430
- Morris!
- Shut up!

01:20:23.665 --> 01:20:27.369
Because of your willingness
in this whole sick charade

01:20:28.705 --> 01:20:31.507
you will get a slow death.

01:20:33.642 --> 01:20:38.547
And you will drag her corpse
everywhere until then.

01:20:52.695 --> 01:20:54.663
No. No.

01:20:57.232 --> 01:20:58.735
Please, no.

01:21:00.302 --> 01:21:01.403
No!

01:21:05.173 --> 01:21:06.341
Please, no.

01:21:11.781 --> 01:21:16.251
I know that a lot of
people don't like the milk in first.

01:21:17.553 --> 01:21:20.522
But it's been scientifically
proven,

01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:25.460
the milk cools the tea evenly.

01:21:30.465 --> 01:21:33.635
It will still scald
your vocal cords,

01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:35.537
as I force feed it
to you though.

01:21:35.571 --> 01:21:37.606
You should be doing
this to William.

01:21:37.639 --> 01:21:38.574
Okay.

01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:42.444
Whatever.

01:21:51.353 --> 01:21:53.622
Oh.

01:22:11.573 --> 01:22:13.475
Always have a back-up plan.

01:22:23.352 --> 01:22:29.726
Look, if you help me to torture
him, I'll kill him first.

01:22:53.582 --> 01:22:54.717
Hold it in his mouth.

01:22:55.752 --> 01:22:57.552
Mm-mm.

01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:00.723
Hold it in his mouth.

01:23:06.261 --> 01:23:07.329
Do it.

01:23:08.363 --> 01:23:09.464
Do it.

01:23:21.744 --> 01:23:24.413
All those recordings
you made, Ryan.

01:23:26.448 --> 01:23:28.617
And you didn't realize
the real truth.

01:23:31.586 --> 01:23:33.588
Who started all of this.

01:23:34.724 --> 01:23:37.492
It was his wife, Adeline.

01:23:37.526 --> 01:23:41.329
Look, what we found
at your house,

01:23:41.998 --> 01:23:45.534
hidden in plain sight.

01:23:48.370 --> 01:23:54.309
Look at how much you people have
made from other people's misery!

01:23:56.445 --> 01:23:59.314
I help people, always have.

01:23:59.347 --> 01:24:02.384
If I get rewarded for that then I
don't see why I shouldn't be able to...

01:24:02.417 --> 01:24:05.287
Have a nice car,
have a nice house?

01:24:06.989 --> 01:24:08.457
Future?

01:24:10.625 --> 01:24:17.299
You two want to be criminals
without getting your hands dirty.

01:24:17.632 --> 01:24:19.769
But you're covered in blood!

01:24:24.606 --> 01:24:25.674
Now...

01:24:32.314 --> 01:24:33.615
this is going to hurt.

01:24:52.334 --> 01:24:53.335
Get up.

01:24:58.708 --> 01:24:59.608
Come on.

01:25:05.748 --> 01:25:07.282
You know what?

01:25:08.751 --> 01:25:11.053
I won't burn you.

01:25:12.688 --> 01:25:13.756
Thank you!

01:25:14.489 --> 01:25:17.727
I'll let one of you live,

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.529
if you kill the other.

01:25:20.562 --> 01:25:21.764
I'll do it.

01:25:22.564 --> 01:25:24.700
- What?
- I'm trying to survive!

01:25:25.802 --> 01:25:29.671
Oh, wow. I was joking!

01:25:31.473 --> 01:25:32.775
But that is hilarious.

01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:35.477
Actually...

01:25:37.512 --> 01:25:38.748
why don't you take it?

01:25:40.515 --> 01:25:41.516
Do it!

01:25:42.752 --> 01:25:43.719
No!

01:25:59.467 --> 01:26:01.369
- Here.
- Ryan!

01:26:02.637 --> 01:26:03.505
Ryan?

01:26:05.174 --> 01:26:07.642
Ryan, no, please.

01:26:11.047 --> 01:26:12.048
Ryan.

01:26:14.016 --> 01:26:16.786
Take the money,
it's everything you'll ever need.

01:26:16.819 --> 01:26:18.620
It's everything we have!

01:26:27.495 --> 01:26:28.663
I'm so sorry, Ryan.

01:26:29.765 --> 01:26:32.500
I wanted to help you,
for what you've done for us.

01:26:36.571 --> 01:26:39.574
Please, Ryan! Ryan...
Can you untie us, please?

01:26:39.608 --> 01:26:41.744
I promise you'll never see
or hear from us again!

01:26:41.777 --> 01:26:42.812
Ryan?

01:26:45.047 --> 01:26:46.082
Ryan!

01:26:50.753 --> 01:26:51.721
Ryan!

01:26:52.755 --> 01:26:54.123
Ryan!

01:28:56.779 --> 01:28:58.047
Let's go.

01:29:13.696 --> 01:29:14.629
Shit.

01:29:19.312 --> 01:29:24.312
