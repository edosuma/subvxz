WEBVTT

00:11.052 --> 00:14.486
Acquiring Blackbird. East on Ocean,
turning north onto Linden.

00:18.527 --> 00:19.996
Traffic camera acquisition.

00:20.098 --> 00:22.509
Leaving Pictometry,
going live in five...

00:27.473 --> 00:28.705
Blackbird acquired.

00:29.647 --> 00:31.850
Crossing to the east side
of the street, Sam.

00:31.910 --> 00:32.975
You got him?

00:33.610 --> 00:34.634
I got him.

00:42.285 --> 00:43.696
We have a visual, Kensi.

00:44.109 --> 00:46.239
Hey, welcome to the party, Mace.

00:49.035 --> 00:50.035
Repositioning.

00:50.072 --> 00:51.702
Back to me at the intersection.

00:51.786 --> 00:54.622
Ease up, Kensi.
You don't want to get there first.

01:05.046 --> 01:07.677
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Blackbird under fire!

01:08.442 --> 01:10.707
All units, close up.
Close up. Shots fired.

01:14.181 --> 01:16.644
- Get me another angle.
- Working on it, Mace.

01:26.682 --> 01:27.738
Kensi, behind you!

01:33.538 --> 01:35.084
Get Chandler. Go, go!

01:36.779 --> 01:37.962
I need a GPS heading.

01:38.022 --> 01:39.750
GPS transmitter's in the briefcase.

01:40.288 --> 01:41.919
We need a visual on Chandler, Sam.

01:43.506 --> 01:44.661
It's a negative, Mace.

01:44.752 --> 01:46.038
Blackbird has flown.

01:46.919 --> 01:47.919
Crap!

02:19.165 --> 02:20.668
Tony, I'm not arguing with you.

02:20.728 --> 02:22.320
- You're arguing now.
- No, I'm not.

02:22.380 --> 02:24.290
- Yes, you are.
- This is not an argument.

02:24.350 --> 02:26.034
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

02:26.094 --> 02:27.410
Yes, it is.

02:27.470 --> 02:28.890
Hold on a second.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.510
Ziva David's phone.

02:31.871 --> 02:35.104
She's not here right now.
Actually she is just walking in.

02:35.219 --> 02:38.392
Man, deep voice, slightly accented,
six-three, 200 pounds,

02:38.473 --> 02:39.988
Prada suit, Italian shoes,

02:40.048 --> 02:42.306
standing on the north side
of the street, looking for Ziva.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.378
Thank you, Tony.

02:49.848 --> 02:51.795
For what were we arguing
about before?

02:52.160 --> 02:53.698
We were not arguing.

02:53.780 --> 02:55.838
Oh, that. Yes, we were.

02:56.580 --> 02:58.857
Do you understand that that's
what we were arguing about...

02:58.881 --> 03:01.507
the fact that you will argue
about the least little thing?

03:01.567 --> 03:04.585
Sometimes you will argue about nothing
at all. You just want to argue.

03:04.731 --> 03:06.733
That's not arguing, McContrary.

03:06.793 --> 03:08.547
Come on, have a little insight.

03:08.607 --> 03:09.724
It's called banter.

03:09.796 --> 03:10.885
No, it is not.

03:10.945 --> 03:13.094
Banter is lighthearted,
witty repartee.

03:13.613 --> 03:14.659
Go on.

03:18.006 --> 03:19.690
It's your turn
to get the coffee. Go.

03:19.888 --> 03:21.060
Don't argue, DiNozzo.

03:21.141 --> 03:22.645
Can't we all just get along?

03:24.635 --> 03:25.940
Coffee can wait, McGee.

03:26.108 --> 03:27.483
Dead Marine can't.

03:29.237 --> 03:31.696
Long-distance can be hard.
Tele-friend from Tel Aviv?

03:31.776 --> 03:33.481
- You're jealous.
- I'm not jealous.

03:33.541 --> 03:34.739
- Yes, you are.
- No.

03:34.821 --> 03:35.866
I'm not arguing.

03:36.340 --> 03:37.117
Are, too.

03:37.234 --> 03:38.234
Am not.

03:57.719 --> 03:59.140
"X" marks the spot.

04:05.769 --> 04:08.121
Private First Class
Nick Francis Chandler.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.585
Camp Pendleton, California.

04:09.645 --> 04:11.055
His left shoe is missing.

04:12.133 --> 04:13.849
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.410
Get a load of this, McSnapper.

04:20.974 --> 04:22.962
Boarding pass.
Los Angeles to DC.

04:23.078 --> 04:24.257
Arrived this morning.

04:24.745 --> 04:26.292
Those red-eye flights can be murder.

04:28.709 --> 04:31.130
What a marvelous view!

04:31.613 --> 04:35.578
The sweep of early American History
at a single glance.

04:35.881 --> 04:38.929
From the Potomac
to the Capital Dome.

04:40.594 --> 04:44.166
I doubt this fellow took
any enjoyment from it.

04:44.226 --> 04:47.146
Construction workers found him
when they arrived to work at 8:00 a.m.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.148
Guessing the flight arrived
around 6:00 a.m.

04:49.229 --> 04:51.108
Half an hour from the airport.

04:51.188 --> 04:55.054
20 minutes for the tie and fry.
Puts time of death around 7:00 a.m.

04:55.373 --> 04:57.907
11 minutes past to be precise.

04:58.287 --> 04:59.992
He's not the only thing
that was fried.

05:03.033 --> 05:05.873
24-volt battery. It's not enough
voltage to electrocute him.

05:05.954 --> 05:08.249
It's enough to suffocate him,
Timothy.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.616
He was suffocated?

05:09.676 --> 05:12.171
The application
of a sustained current

05:12.251 --> 05:13.839
across the chest causes

05:13.920 --> 05:16.624
tetanic contraction
of the respiratory muscles.

05:16.684 --> 05:19.220
The diaphragm
and the intercostals seize up.

05:19.807 --> 05:21.922
I mean,
this poor fellow would have been...

05:22.142 --> 05:24.884
fully conscious
and yet unable to speak.

05:26.370 --> 05:28.123
Death by suffocation.

05:28.183 --> 05:30.666
It's a particularly excruciating,

05:30.726 --> 05:33.566
terrifying and slow way to die.

05:33.771 --> 05:35.092
Wanted him to suffer.

05:36.272 --> 05:37.272
Or talk.

05:39.058 --> 05:41.450
Chandler was deployed to Kuwait.
Got back yesterday.

05:41.832 --> 05:43.114
Humanitarian leave.

05:43.395 --> 05:44.436
Service records?

05:44.496 --> 05:45.438
Exemplary.

05:45.498 --> 05:47.362
Not so much as a scuffed boot.

05:47.997 --> 05:50.109
Chandler bought
his airline ticket at the gate.

05:50.289 --> 05:52.749
No checked luggage.
Man in a hurry to get somewhere.

05:53.143 --> 05:54.421
Or away from someone.

05:54.502 --> 05:55.375
Car rental?

05:55.435 --> 05:57.997
Booked a car in flight with a credit
card but did not pick it up.

05:58.057 --> 06:01.010
- Someone else picked him up first.
- Boss, we've got some activity here.

06:01.091 --> 06:02.936
We are not the only ones
looking at Chandler.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.433
A BOLO's been issued out
of Los Angeles, nationwide alert.

06:05.859 --> 06:06.859
LAPD?

06:07.206 --> 06:08.206
Negative.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.273
Who issued the BOLO, McGee?

06:13.635 --> 06:14.635
We did.

06:17.422 --> 06:18.435
It's NCIS.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.622
All units close up. Close up.

06:28.793 --> 06:31.116
Shots fired. Give me another angle.
Working on it, Mace.

06:31.809 --> 06:35.171
Chandler's mother was beaten half
to death in a home invasion last week.

06:35.587 --> 06:39.174
Before he left Kuwait, someone gave him
a quarter of a million dollars.

06:39.450 --> 06:42.087
Told him if he delivered it
to an address in Los Angeles,

06:42.147 --> 06:44.307
they wouldn't go back
and finish the job on his mother.

06:45.865 --> 06:48.100
He was an easy target.
He was an only child.

06:48.376 --> 06:50.728
A local informant tipped off
our field office.

06:51.139 --> 06:53.107
We were waiting
when he got off his flight.

06:53.769 --> 06:55.111
He agreed to work with us.

06:55.171 --> 06:57.571
But on the way to make the drop,
somebody took a shot at him.

06:57.819 --> 06:58.964
The kid panicked.

06:59.481 --> 07:02.963
Tried to get home to see his mother
in West Virginia, got as far as DC.

07:03.198 --> 07:05.226
Not just about a dead Marine, Leon.

07:05.584 --> 07:09.438
I got a bad feeling about an arms-deal
case we're investigating in Los Angeles.

07:10.190 --> 07:11.791
You think the two cases are linked?

07:12.250 --> 07:13.350
Go find out.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.624
Pair up with them.
Take somebody with you.

07:15.684 --> 07:17.546
- San Diego office?
- Los Angeles.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.062
OSP.

07:19.251 --> 07:20.374
They have the lead.

07:21.860 --> 07:24.748
- Macy still the agent in charge there?
- You got a problem?

07:26.706 --> 07:27.754
She might.

07:28.189 --> 07:30.732
Well, you're on the same team.
Work it out.

07:32.504 --> 07:33.977
It's a negative, Mace.

07:34.134 --> 07:35.358
Blackbird has flown.

07:39.594 --> 07:40.701
He got a name?

07:40.761 --> 07:41.504
Who?

07:41.705 --> 07:43.521
- Star of David.
- Oh, him.

07:44.469 --> 07:46.242
Yes, he has a name.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.492
Trevor? Bruce?

07:49.003 --> 07:50.521
- Marmaduke?
- Michael.

07:51.708 --> 07:53.940
Sounded more like a Bruce
than a Michael on the phone.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.542
Okay, grab your toothbrush.

07:55.624 --> 07:57.747
- Road trip?
- Los Angeles.

07:57.989 --> 07:59.755
Californ-i-a.
What time do we leave?

08:00.345 --> 08:01.345
Not we.

08:03.123 --> 08:04.510
McGee? Not me?

08:04.961 --> 08:06.011
McGoo, you?

08:07.624 --> 08:10.183
Joint operation with OSP.
Chandler case.

08:11.348 --> 08:12.847
I need you to follow up here.

08:13.158 --> 08:14.228
Pick up's in 45.

08:17.136 --> 08:18.286
OSP?

08:18.562 --> 08:21.476
Office of Special Projects.
NCIS undercover.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.654
- Surveillance.
- Super cool toys.

08:26.012 --> 08:27.366
After our last trip to L.A.,

08:27.808 --> 08:30.119
I do not understand
why you would think I would be such

08:30.200 --> 08:32.280
an eager platypus, Tony.

08:32.910 --> 08:35.207
Beaver. Eager beaver.
Not platypus.

08:37.192 --> 08:39.736
Why does that bother me so much?
Don't answer that.

08:39.934 --> 08:41.001
Answer that.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.840
Shalom.

08:54.027 --> 08:56.541
Well, Tony, I guess the boss knows
who's got his back.

08:56.601 --> 08:59.940
Not just his back,
McProbie, his ears as well.

09:00.020 --> 09:01.814
What are you talking about the ears?

09:01.874 --> 09:04.720
The aeroplane...
five-and-a-half hours flying time.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.258
You're going to have to chew the fat,
McChitty-Chat.

09:07.318 --> 09:09.008
What are you going
to talk to him about?

09:09.273 --> 09:11.243
- I've got to talk to him?
- Oh, yeah.

09:11.620 --> 09:12.732
Small talk.

09:12.792 --> 09:14.537
Better brush up
on your boat building.

09:14.618 --> 09:16.414
Maybe pick up a copy
of Sniper Monthly.

09:16.495 --> 09:19.668
Seriously, don't mention marriage,
divorce or Vance.

09:22.488 --> 09:24.047
- Cover for me?
- What?

09:24.415 --> 09:26.304
- When will you be back?
- Soon.

09:27.494 --> 09:28.494
Later.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.574
You do, or you did?

09:42.020 --> 09:43.943
Okay, I'll do that.

09:44.042 --> 09:45.042
You, too.

09:45.366 --> 09:46.366
Ciao.

09:48.001 --> 09:50.096
- That was weird.
- What's weird, Abs?

09:50.655 --> 09:52.909
Special Projects in Los Angeles...

09:53.154 --> 09:56.663
they just e-mailed me confirming
their interest in our "X" man.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.457
- PFC Chandler.
- That's him.

09:59.778 --> 10:01.587
Special Agent Macy?

10:02.041 --> 10:05.130
That's her. She wants me
to copy her on all my findings.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.509
You know her.

10:09.355 --> 10:11.887
Not a question, Gibbs.
You know her.

10:12.804 --> 10:14.136
You find out anything, Abs,

10:14.196 --> 10:16.600
you contact me first,
and then you can send it on to her.

10:17.012 --> 10:18.519
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.611
That's what I came here
to tell you... Los Angeles.

10:20.671 --> 10:21.939
Into the lioness' den?

10:22.607 --> 10:23.817
I'm taking McGee.

10:27.170 --> 10:28.170
It's just...

10:28.932 --> 10:32.366
the last time you guys went to L.A.,
one of you didn't come back.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.412
I'll bring him home.

10:36.674 --> 10:37.674
Just...

10:38.677 --> 10:41.125
make sure
you bring yourself back, too.

10:42.178 --> 10:44.402
Did he use a credit card for that?

10:44.462 --> 10:46.455
Yes, he used a credit card
for the call.

10:52.003 --> 10:54.763
So he just made one call
from the airphone, huh?

10:55.381 --> 10:56.381
Okay.

10:56.638 --> 10:59.510
Yeah, that's all I need to know.
Thanks. Bye.

11:26.836 --> 11:28.714
Hi, I'm not keeping you
from anything, am I?

11:29.110 --> 11:30.423
Like work?

11:30.505 --> 11:32.760
Tony, I'm working on something.
I'm following a lead.

11:33.411 --> 11:35.220
A lead? On Chandler?

11:35.300 --> 11:37.055
It might not come to anything.

11:38.399 --> 11:39.399
Care to share?

11:40.238 --> 11:42.185
Tony, I cannot talk, I have to go.

11:42.505 --> 11:43.505
Go!

11:48.425 --> 11:49.425
Gone.

11:57.323 --> 11:59.151
I do not want to lie to him,
Michael.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.800
A small lie.

12:04.420 --> 12:05.995
Your father sends his love.

12:07.899 --> 12:09.378
What else does my father send?

12:15.053 --> 12:16.053
Me.

12:46.491 --> 12:48.761
Boss, you sure
this is the right place?

12:58.646 --> 12:59.646
Hi.

13:01.619 --> 13:03.992
- Welcome to OSP. I'm Kensi.
- Special Agent Gibbs.

13:04.763 --> 13:05.815
Agent McGee.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.386
You sail, Agent McGee?

13:08.688 --> 13:09.688
No.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.066
Build boats?

13:11.126 --> 13:12.959
No, it's a conversation starter.

13:13.725 --> 13:14.760
Works.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.755
You guys get
any sleep on the flight?

13:16.843 --> 13:17.847
Not a wink.

13:17.962 --> 13:19.466
Slept the whole way.

13:22.180 --> 13:23.254
Been here before?

13:23.314 --> 13:24.605
- Yeah.
- No.

13:31.323 --> 13:32.323
Buckle up.

13:33.405 --> 13:35.100
NSA is worried about
the Horn of Africa.

13:35.838 --> 13:37.104
Somalia, in particular.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.401
Increased chatter?

13:38.700 --> 13:41.133
Opposite. Suddenly,
all they're hearing is crickets.

13:41.684 --> 13:44.502
Maybe the bad guys have
all given up and gone home.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.610
Or maybe they're
on their way over here.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.594
You tell Gibbs to call me
when he arrives.

13:51.287 --> 13:52.999
Well, you can tell him yourself.

13:56.558 --> 13:57.846
Hello, Director Vance.

13:58.042 --> 14:00.507
I know how excited
you two are about working together.

14:05.142 --> 14:07.430
I told Secnav I'd have
my best people on this one.

14:08.621 --> 14:10.517
A lot of nervous people
at the Pentagon.

14:10.988 --> 14:12.685
Don't make me have
to come out there.

14:23.282 --> 14:24.870
He told you I got the lead?

14:25.199 --> 14:26.828
Yeah, he told me.

14:29.631 --> 14:31.016
You still drink coffee?

14:39.347 --> 14:41.005
It's everything
we know about Chandler.

14:44.155 --> 14:46.469
- How's his mother?
- She wants her son.

14:48.118 --> 14:50.014
- What was the op?
- Follow the money.

14:50.094 --> 14:52.626
Put a GPS locator in his briefcase.

14:53.057 --> 14:54.608
Shadowed him to the rendezvous.

14:54.724 --> 14:56.475
Didn't have a lot of time
to set it up.

14:56.535 --> 14:58.523
Someone was running
counter surveillance.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.483
Whoever he was going to meet

15:00.683 --> 15:02.918
took him out to protect themselves.

15:04.547 --> 15:05.550
Your team...

15:06.035 --> 15:08.011
- got made.
- My team didn't get made.

15:08.181 --> 15:09.492
You said...

15:09.701 --> 15:10.993
it was a rushed job.

15:11.075 --> 15:13.184
And you've never had
a blown surveillance op?

15:14.615 --> 15:15.832
Who was he meeting with?

15:16.432 --> 15:17.624
Someone called Liam.

15:17.705 --> 15:19.825
How's this tied to the arms deal
you're investigating?

15:19.861 --> 15:22.967
Max Talia is brokering the arms deal,
paid in cash.

15:23.342 --> 15:25.216
Says the money's coming
in from overseas.

15:28.163 --> 15:29.804
Not much of a connection.

15:33.477 --> 15:34.843
You have met Talia?

15:34.903 --> 15:36.269
Meet's in a couple of hours.

15:36.350 --> 15:37.474
Local diner.

15:37.850 --> 15:40.371
Undercover. It's what we do.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.070
A word of advice, Jethro.

15:47.852 --> 15:48.948
Let me do my job.

15:52.163 --> 15:54.287
Like you did the first time we met?

15:57.078 --> 15:58.290
That is not coffee.

16:06.731 --> 16:08.384
They're all set at the diner.

16:09.230 --> 16:10.230
Callen?

16:10.441 --> 16:12.292
Haven't seen him... yet.

16:17.353 --> 16:18.823
Get out of my head, Nate.

16:19.018 --> 16:21.481
Operational psychologist.
It's my job to be in your head.

16:22.103 --> 16:23.524
So, Gibbs...

16:23.916 --> 16:25.902
- You want to talk about him?
- No.

16:26.351 --> 16:27.654
Well, he doesn't trust you.

16:29.354 --> 16:31.608
Body language screamed it.
He couldn't wait to leave.

16:31.668 --> 16:34.079
Nate, you just passed him
in the doorway.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.674
You should have slept
with him way back then...

16:38.269 --> 16:39.374
whenever then was.

16:39.455 --> 16:41.482
I was probably
in elementary school, yeah?

16:41.581 --> 16:42.803
How do you know I didn't?

16:42.863 --> 16:45.129
- I can tell you right now...
- Don't answer that.

16:45.209 --> 16:46.130
Okay, cool.

16:46.211 --> 16:47.858
- You scare me.
- Yup.

16:48.004 --> 16:49.004
Leave.

16:50.650 --> 16:51.719
Find Callen.

16:52.687 --> 16:53.894
Yeah, right.

17:04.561 --> 17:06.733
Hey, DiNozzo,
tell me you got something.

17:06.997 --> 17:09.569
No luck with the security
footage at the airport.

17:09.651 --> 17:11.232
Chandler got lost in the crowd.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.409
The truck batteries used for the fry-up
are cheap Chinese imports.

17:14.489 --> 17:16.809
- Thousands sold every year.
- That's what you haven't got.

17:17.424 --> 17:20.622
Also checking similar M.O.'s.
Guys knew what they were doing.

17:20.731 --> 17:24.226
- Means they've done it before, right?
- We're looking for a guy named Liam.

17:24.759 --> 17:25.759
Liam.

17:26.047 --> 17:27.047
Got it.

17:30.997 --> 17:32.427
She's following up on a lead.

17:34.399 --> 17:36.110
Looks like it didn't go anywhere.

17:36.982 --> 17:40.101
- How was the flight, boss?
- Swell. McGee kept me entertained.

17:41.984 --> 17:44.783
He is full of surprises.
Well done, that man.

17:44.984 --> 17:46.880
- Stay on it.
- Will do, boss.

17:48.366 --> 17:49.665
You done with that?

17:50.513 --> 17:51.571
Yeah, I'm done.

17:51.996 --> 17:52.996
No, stay.

17:54.693 --> 17:56.993
Keep 'em company.
I'm visiting a friend.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.083
I'm sorry about yesterday.

18:04.503 --> 18:07.002
That's okay.
I like to keep insanely busy.

18:07.238 --> 18:08.504
I said I was sorry.

18:09.474 --> 18:11.841
The lead did not lead anywhere.

18:13.045 --> 18:14.128
Don't sweat on it.

18:16.564 --> 18:18.723
No problemo, Davido.

18:21.588 --> 18:23.468
Meeting's at the diner
at Venice Beach.

18:23.641 --> 18:25.516
We'll be taking feeds
from four cameras.

18:28.048 --> 18:30.109
We have a traffic cam
at the intersection.

18:30.211 --> 18:32.276
We have a store security cam
across the street,

18:32.401 --> 18:34.363
two pre-placed minis
inside the diner.

18:34.444 --> 18:35.990
- We up?
- Coming on stream.

18:36.711 --> 18:38.326
- Kensi?
- 15 minutes out.

18:38.462 --> 18:39.535
Kickoff's in 30.

18:39.651 --> 18:40.651
Callen?

18:46.247 --> 18:47.487
Who's Callen?

18:54.025 --> 18:56.246
Still building
that boat in your basement?

18:56.902 --> 18:58.491
- Yeah.
- The same one?

18:58.551 --> 19:00.306
No, no. A different one.

19:01.050 --> 19:02.933
Two boats. Three wives.

19:03.190 --> 19:04.190
Four...

19:05.106 --> 19:06.106
wives.

19:09.963 --> 19:11.067
Did you see Mace?

19:13.442 --> 19:14.577
Yeah, I saw her.

19:16.965 --> 19:18.441
You have a long memory.

19:19.714 --> 19:21.125
So, how are you, Callen?

19:22.088 --> 19:23.088
Not bad.

19:24.228 --> 19:26.220
Even bordering on good some days.

19:27.819 --> 19:29.342
You still looking, huh?

19:29.581 --> 19:30.748
I'm still looking.

19:34.350 --> 19:36.510
Is there a reason we're not meeting
in a bar right now?

19:36.591 --> 19:38.590
Well, yeah,
it's 10:00 in the morning.

19:39.944 --> 19:41.397
I don't know what's worse,

19:42.487 --> 19:44.568
getting older or getting wiser?

20:03.658 --> 20:05.538
It was a good game, but,

20:06.425 --> 20:08.462
the striker never should have been
red-carded.

20:09.205 --> 20:10.945
Might have mentioned
you were undercover.

20:11.005 --> 20:12.062
Well, I'm not.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.612
Just for her.

20:14.151 --> 20:15.798
She lives across the street from me.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.026
Just got here from St. Petersburg.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.347
Lonely.

20:19.590 --> 20:22.453
Figure if she thinks I'm Russian Mafia,
she won't want to make friends.

20:27.348 --> 20:29.163
Sometimes you get weeks
to plan them,

20:29.812 --> 20:31.272
sometimes a day.

20:31.728 --> 20:35.484
Meeting an arms dealer named Talia.
Doesn't trust anyone.

20:35.746 --> 20:37.120
I don't like our chances.

20:37.818 --> 20:39.447
Kind of like
that first op in Serbia.

20:40.276 --> 20:41.981
You saved my ass on that one.

20:42.560 --> 20:43.975
- That was Moscow.
- No, no.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.841
My ass did not need saving
in Moscow.

20:45.901 --> 20:49.342
That was Petrov.
Petrov's ass always needed saving.

20:49.402 --> 20:50.750
Worked with some good people.

20:51.373 --> 20:53.548
Yup. Made some good friends.

20:54.214 --> 20:55.264
Lost a few.

21:03.831 --> 21:05.550
Next time, we park in a bar.

21:05.928 --> 21:07.308
No more BOLO in the park.

21:08.217 --> 21:09.217
Next time.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.904
Camera two is up in the diner.

21:21.131 --> 21:22.281
Camera two recording.

21:25.591 --> 21:26.952
We're getting this call?

21:27.034 --> 21:28.034
Trying.

21:29.952 --> 21:31.999
Caller's a cell number...
cheap throwaway.

21:32.092 --> 21:33.903
Bringing up the outside links.

21:35.885 --> 21:37.820
Camera three and four are up.

21:43.765 --> 21:44.778
Game time.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.098
Callen, where the hell are you?

21:47.178 --> 21:48.224
At the diner.

21:48.770 --> 21:50.059
Looking right at you, Mace.

21:53.493 --> 21:54.493
Hey, Eric...

21:55.850 --> 21:56.941
this wire itches.

21:59.076 --> 22:00.319
Need a sound check, G.

22:00.573 --> 22:01.629
18 years.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.416
Wouldn't kill you to cut Gibbs
a little bit of slack, Mace.

22:09.368 --> 22:10.871
Honk once if you can hear me, Sam.

22:11.427 --> 22:13.887
Hadley... horn... once.

22:27.802 --> 22:29.348
He's in. Street's clear.

22:41.430 --> 22:42.430
You Talia?

22:42.565 --> 22:43.565
Yeah.

22:48.489 --> 22:49.827
My cousin had a diner...

22:51.118 --> 22:52.118
in Chicago.

22:52.701 --> 22:53.914
Not like this, though.

22:54.116 --> 22:55.708
Old-style booths and...

22:55.805 --> 22:57.868
what do you call them?
Soda fountains.

22:59.764 --> 23:01.797
His roaches probably ran
a little bigger, too.

23:03.114 --> 23:06.164
Hygiene wasn't
one of cousin Mario's strong points.

23:10.392 --> 23:12.183
Acquaintance tells me
you're in the market.

23:13.222 --> 23:14.268
And who are you?

23:15.193 --> 23:16.854
Somebody who can get you
what you want.

23:19.002 --> 23:20.092
I don't know you.

23:20.432 --> 23:22.464
I come very highly recommended,

23:23.114 --> 23:24.361
or you wouldn't be here.

23:26.495 --> 23:28.531
Friend of a friend of some lowlife.

23:29.430 --> 23:30.430
Exactly.

23:30.915 --> 23:32.159
We all take some risk.

23:33.279 --> 23:35.748
- So what do you need?
- Not me, a client.

23:37.870 --> 23:38.870
Okay.

23:38.934 --> 23:40.502
What does your client need?

23:41.149 --> 23:43.370
- He needs toys.
- Hunting rifles?

23:43.998 --> 23:45.654
Shotguns? BB guns? What?

23:46.468 --> 23:49.254
He's thinking more Fourth of July.

23:50.855 --> 23:51.930
Big toys.

23:59.618 --> 24:00.618
You wired?

24:03.781 --> 24:04.781
What?

24:07.559 --> 24:08.864
I said are you wired?

24:11.071 --> 24:12.071
Are you?

24:18.011 --> 24:18.791
When?

24:18.997 --> 24:20.084
Tomorrow.

24:21.310 --> 24:22.710
- Can't happen.
- Look,

24:24.073 --> 24:26.757
"no" is not a word
my client understands.

24:27.156 --> 24:28.929
Then let me explain it to him.

24:30.040 --> 24:32.930
Excuse me, sir. The gentleman over there
asked me to give you this.

24:52.936 --> 24:53.993
Buzz off.

24:54.813 --> 24:56.588
- What?
- You heard me.

24:56.801 --> 24:57.955
I said buzz off.

24:58.036 --> 24:59.790
Op's over.
Time to get him out of there.

25:00.996 --> 25:02.293
We're done.

25:10.439 --> 25:11.439
You know,

25:12.311 --> 25:14.909
it's not your client
you should be worried about.

25:29.484 --> 25:30.905
Got playback on Talia's call.

25:32.037 --> 25:33.037
Go.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.117
I know, I know.

25:36.034 --> 25:37.411
Look, I'm working on it.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.864
Look, just give me
a few more days...

25:41.579 --> 25:43.959
and you can...
everything you want, Liam.

25:44.313 --> 25:45.419
Quality sucks, Mace.

25:45.822 --> 25:47.838
Replay, isolate the last word.

25:52.128 --> 25:54.071
Everything you want, Liam.

25:54.324 --> 25:56.162
Everything you want, Liam.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.666
There's our connection.
Same guy Chandler was meeting.

25:59.627 --> 26:00.768
Same guy.

26:07.715 --> 26:10.719
Chandler was coerced into smuggling
a quarter million dollars

26:10.800 --> 26:12.974
from Kuwait by this guy Liam.

26:13.510 --> 26:16.350
- Wiring it to a bank would be easier.
- Would have left a paper trail.

26:16.410 --> 26:19.129
And at the same time,
Liam approaches Talia,

26:19.599 --> 26:21.605
asking him to get him
some serious fire power.

26:22.244 --> 26:24.941
- Cash, weapons...
- And a deadline.

26:25.541 --> 26:27.665
You have a plan, Special Agent Macy?

26:31.090 --> 26:32.157
Talia's the plan.

26:33.363 --> 26:36.119
Will you give Agents Gibbs
and McGee a full brief of the operation.

26:36.741 --> 26:37.741
Include Renko.

26:38.227 --> 26:39.284
Sure thing.

26:47.574 --> 26:48.951
18 years.

26:50.337 --> 26:53.098
Would have made you a lieutenant
in the Marine Corps, Military Police.

26:53.595 --> 26:55.931
- Gibbs was still a gunny...
- Don't go there.

26:56.967 --> 26:58.594
Did you work on a case together?

26:59.056 --> 27:00.317
Why do you want to know?

27:01.032 --> 27:02.604
Just looking out for my family.

27:02.968 --> 27:04.481
G, you don't have any family.

27:04.968 --> 27:07.231
- That's cold, Mace.
- But true.

27:09.380 --> 27:10.457
Gibbs is family.

27:12.111 --> 27:13.111
You, too.

27:16.728 --> 27:18.356
Got any photographs in uniform?

27:19.271 --> 27:20.768
Yes. And no,

27:21.451 --> 27:22.624
you can't see them.

27:24.625 --> 27:25.625
Okay.

27:26.533 --> 27:28.313
I'll just ask Gibbs what happened.

27:29.790 --> 27:31.341
Yeah, let me know if you do.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.470
I want to be there to see him
sit you on your ass.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.953
He can be very disconcerting,
can't he?

27:42.034 --> 27:45.036
Popping up behind you just
when you have something to give him.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.785
- Man's a mind reader.
- Pretend you're him.

27:48.842 --> 27:50.062
What you got, Duck?

27:50.471 --> 27:52.134
That's very good.

27:52.724 --> 27:54.990
The dreaded paper chase, Jethro.

27:55.582 --> 27:57.491
I need your signature.

27:57.572 --> 27:59.396
Okay, well,
I'm gonna stop being Jethro

27:59.456 --> 28:01.884
and revert to being plain
old very Special Agent...

28:02.225 --> 28:03.707
Anthony DiNozzo.

28:04.608 --> 28:06.766
- Where do I sign?
- All seven pages.

28:07.374 --> 28:10.881
And while you sign, you can tell me
why you came down here to see me.

28:13.388 --> 28:14.885
Personal, not professional.

28:15.850 --> 28:17.040
It's not what you think.

28:17.100 --> 28:19.181
I'm not thinking anything.
What are you thinking?

28:19.262 --> 28:21.224
I'm thinking
she's worried about something.

28:23.885 --> 28:25.227
She seems distracted.

28:25.603 --> 28:28.481
Yes, well, we all get distracted.
Keep signing.

28:30.849 --> 28:34.028
She ever talk to you about what she did
when she went back to Israel?

28:34.499 --> 28:35.199
No.

28:35.449 --> 28:38.658
She was involved
in an undercover operation in Morocco.

28:38.913 --> 28:40.452
Yeah, I know all about that.

28:41.394 --> 28:42.579
She almost died.

28:45.206 --> 28:46.666
Really? I didn't know about that.

28:47.696 --> 28:50.420
There was a glimpse of her
on some newsreel footage

28:50.501 --> 28:52.130
after the bomb blast.

28:52.957 --> 28:56.102
- If she's distracted...
- I'm just probably overreacting.

28:56.162 --> 28:57.331
And look at that!

28:57.391 --> 28:58.646
Done and done.

29:00.851 --> 29:02.415
Anything else I should know about?

29:02.555 --> 29:06.417
Cause of death was indeed suffocation,
brought about by electric shock.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.606
Numerous contusions
and bruising suggests

29:09.985 --> 29:13.893
that he was forcibly abducted
before he was strung up and tortured.

29:15.797 --> 29:16.889
Lovely.

29:17.359 --> 29:18.573
And there was skin.

29:19.605 --> 29:20.659
On the rope.

29:21.003 --> 29:23.119
Abby found epithelial tissue,

29:23.998 --> 29:26.728
which suggests that the man
for whom you are looking

29:27.345 --> 29:31.040
will have a rather nasty rope burn
on one of his hands.

30:02.460 --> 30:04.785
- So which case is this exactly?
- My case.

30:04.867 --> 30:07.247
Special investigation.
Top secret.

30:08.269 --> 30:09.854
I'm not even gonna ask.

30:11.808 --> 30:13.426
Does it have anything
to do with Ziva?

30:13.625 --> 30:16.693
- You said you weren't gonna ask.
- Okay, I won't ask. Just tell me.

30:19.393 --> 30:20.393
Got a match.

30:21.011 --> 30:22.144
Immigration photo.

30:22.644 --> 30:24.610
Michael Aaron Rivkin.

30:24.670 --> 30:28.059
Israeli citizen, lives in Tel Aviv,
works for a bank,

30:28.402 --> 30:30.645
and flew into D.C. two days ago.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.735
Is that the answer to the question
I'm not allowed to ask?

30:34.142 --> 30:35.969
Depends. Any more photos?

30:40.580 --> 30:42.495
Right there. You see it?
A flash.

30:42.858 --> 30:44.422
It's a reflection in a car window.

30:44.532 --> 30:46.093
It's a reflection of a flash.

30:46.153 --> 30:48.207
Can you pull up
the bullet trajectory data?

30:55.645 --> 30:57.594
Boss, I really got
to get one of these.

30:58.453 --> 31:00.926
Obviously, budgets permitting.

31:01.502 --> 31:02.718
It's a single source.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.361
Shooter was in the street.

31:04.421 --> 31:05.621
Or in the car.

31:08.611 --> 31:11.895
Let's pull up LM-Safe, see if there are
any other camera angles we can access.

31:13.810 --> 31:15.023
That's the traffic cam.

31:17.439 --> 31:18.777
Two security cameras.

31:19.421 --> 31:20.654
Got a fourth angle.

31:21.672 --> 31:22.697
ATM camera.

31:23.212 --> 31:24.975
I'll input the network data.

31:34.734 --> 31:36.029
There it is.

31:38.352 --> 31:39.497
There's Chandler.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.218
It's an SUV,
but you can't see any plates.

31:43.737 --> 31:44.737
Got it.

31:48.219 --> 31:49.349
There's our shooter.

31:49.871 --> 31:51.017
Might even be Liam.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.275
Send the photo to Abby.

31:55.998 --> 31:57.691
Navy Op directory.

32:01.425 --> 32:03.196
Abby Sciuto.

32:06.577 --> 32:07.577
On its way.

32:07.799 --> 32:09.975
Oh, I really got
to get one of these.

32:14.417 --> 32:15.528
You got problems.

32:17.455 --> 32:20.304
Do you have a current address?
Okay. Thanks.

32:21.229 --> 32:22.251
I have a lead.

32:22.551 --> 32:23.651
A real lead?

32:23.711 --> 32:25.138
I mean... Really? A lead?

32:26.690 --> 32:28.541
18 months ago,
a man was found strung up

32:28.601 --> 32:31.041
and wired to a battery
in a forest outside of Baltimore.

32:31.101 --> 32:33.534
Same M.O. as Chandler's.
Prime suspects are brothers.

32:33.641 --> 32:35.428
Stephano and Benji Kass.

32:35.488 --> 32:37.224
They run a scaffolding business.

32:37.435 --> 32:38.704
Why weren't they charged?

32:39.738 --> 32:41.566
All witnesses disappeared.

32:48.022 --> 32:49.409
Well, look at that.

32:49.817 --> 32:52.078
Six-cylinder gas-powered beast.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.955
V-8. Diesel.

32:55.406 --> 32:57.083
- Batteries in here.
- Here.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.330
Over there.

33:02.031 --> 33:03.882
Two 12-volt batteries.

33:04.157 --> 33:05.157
New.

33:06.308 --> 33:07.873
You looking for something?

33:09.500 --> 33:12.640
Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS.

33:13.521 --> 33:14.893
You must be the Kass boys.

33:15.824 --> 33:17.729
- Is this your rig?
- What if it is?

33:18.687 --> 33:21.191
Tony, Chandler's left shoe
was missing.

33:25.009 --> 33:26.009
Freeze!

33:31.821 --> 33:33.151
I'm guessing Stephano?

33:48.259 --> 33:50.053
Looks like the guys
who put the scaffolding

33:50.134 --> 33:51.782
together got a little careless?

33:51.842 --> 33:53.723
Wait a minute.
That would be you, wouldn't it?

33:56.864 --> 33:58.686
That's a nasty rope burn
you got there.

33:58.767 --> 34:00.814
I'm losing my grip. Come on.

34:00.971 --> 34:03.733
- How much did he pay you?
- Come on man, please.

34:04.003 --> 34:05.568
How much?

34:05.981 --> 34:08.871
Nothing, okay. We owed him one.

34:09.058 --> 34:11.321
He called us. He told us
to pick Chandler up at the airport

34:11.344 --> 34:14.119
- and e-mailed us his flight and photo.
- What was his name?

34:14.530 --> 34:18.165
Come on. You don't know
what he's like, okay? He'll kill me.

34:18.286 --> 34:20.708
Benji, my hands are getting
a little sweaty.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.378
And I don't know what's going
to happen if I, you know...

34:23.989 --> 34:25.422
For instance.

34:26.377 --> 34:27.549
What's his name?

34:28.038 --> 34:29.507
Okay. His name is Liam.

34:29.589 --> 34:32.094
- What's his last name?
- It's just... It's just Liam.

34:50.074 --> 34:51.955
- What about Stephano?
- No, he's not talking.

34:52.088 --> 34:53.290
Work it, DiNozzo.

34:53.472 --> 34:54.917
Need a last name for Liam.

34:56.043 --> 34:57.043
Anything?

34:57.341 --> 34:59.871
Abby's running facial recognition
on the guy in the SUV,

34:59.931 --> 35:01.756
she's going to call us
when she gets a match.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.839
- What have you got?
- Chandler's killers.

35:04.301 --> 35:07.082
Got a call from Liam to grab him
at the airport in D.C.

35:07.142 --> 35:08.820
- No last name?
- Working it.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.467
Mace, Talia's on his phone.

35:10.527 --> 35:11.981
Lights dimmed. On-screen.

35:12.041 --> 35:13.935
Bugged his car
while he was in the diner.

35:14.016 --> 35:16.312
Surveillance video, coming in live.

35:16.394 --> 35:18.273
He's on his speaker phone.
Quality's not great.

35:18.355 --> 35:20.029
I need to speak to Mattie Rae.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.200
Speaking.

35:21.776 --> 35:23.128
The diner this morning.

35:23.652 --> 35:25.060
How'd you know he was a cop?

35:25.120 --> 35:26.120
Who is this?

35:26.342 --> 35:28.158
Name's Max... Talia.

35:28.577 --> 35:31.156
- How did you get my number?
- Waitress at the diner.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.540
I can see why you gave it her.
She's a cutie.

35:33.919 --> 35:36.916
Saved me a lot of embarrassment
this morning, Mattie.

35:36.997 --> 35:40.279
Yeah, well, that chump just about ruined
my life, so, easy favor, you know?

35:40.466 --> 35:42.338
Five years for dealing guns, huh?

35:42.419 --> 35:44.906
Wait a minute. How did you know that?
Who you been talking to?

35:45.095 --> 35:46.824
I've got friends, Mattie.

35:47.365 --> 35:49.137
Made some inquiries.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.155
I heard you're back in the game.

35:51.351 --> 35:52.140
Maybe.

35:52.341 --> 35:54.643
Look, Mattie, I got
a cashed-up client looking for

35:54.723 --> 35:56.954
some specialized ordinance
in a hurry.

35:57.681 --> 35:59.064
I could cut you in.

35:59.217 --> 36:00.344
How specialized?

36:00.647 --> 36:02.717
Assault weapons, C-4.

36:03.278 --> 36:04.379
You can handle that?

36:04.439 --> 36:07.528
Well, I know people who could get you
a tank if you had a big enough suitcase.

36:07.731 --> 36:10.423
Look, I need to meet this guy first.
I got to know who I'm dealing with.

36:10.447 --> 36:12.077
There's an old parking garage

36:12.158 --> 36:15.216
downtown, East Temple,
where it hits the train line.

36:16.155 --> 36:18.083
40 minutes. Work for you?

36:18.593 --> 36:19.730
I'll be there.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.338
Looks like we've got
ourselves a meeting.

36:23.155 --> 36:25.716
- All right, camera three's on-line.
- All units stand by.

36:26.615 --> 36:27.801
Mattie Rae is here.

36:28.288 --> 36:29.803
And here comes Talia.

36:31.928 --> 36:33.849
Still waiting on the guest of honor.

36:36.358 --> 36:38.354
Talia's made the call.
Liam's on his way.

36:38.435 --> 36:40.200
I don't think Liam would be
the kind of guy

36:40.260 --> 36:42.188
to show up to a meeting
on short notice.

36:42.248 --> 36:43.426
He's under pressure.

36:44.324 --> 36:46.535
Losing Chandler screwed up
his timetable.

36:46.595 --> 36:49.866
He probably had to find
that cash fast from some place else.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.690
He's desperate.

36:52.065 --> 36:53.118
Our advantage.

36:53.199 --> 36:55.119
Vehicle entering the alley.

36:55.896 --> 36:57.039
They're on the move.

37:10.913 --> 37:12.197
That's Liam.

37:17.393 --> 37:20.187
McGee, go tight on Liam.
What do you see?

37:20.562 --> 37:22.235
Zoom in on camera one, please.

37:25.596 --> 37:27.605
Wearing jeans and a sports coat.

37:27.909 --> 37:30.018
He's carrying...
Looks like a long barrel...

37:30.078 --> 37:31.344
It's a hit!

37:49.132 --> 37:50.259
Separate them.

37:51.849 --> 37:53.219
On your feet, Mr. Talia.

37:53.448 --> 37:54.763
Hands behind your back.

37:55.547 --> 37:57.515
You're the friggin' waitress
from the diner.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.074
Should have tipped me better, huh?

38:01.162 --> 38:02.162
Gibbs.

38:02.598 --> 38:04.690
Special Agent Mike Renko.
Thanks for the spot.

38:05.474 --> 38:07.774
- You okay, Mike?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

38:07.982 --> 38:10.240
That got interesting pretty fast,
huh, Mace?

38:10.526 --> 38:13.456
- How did you guys know it was a hit?
- Weapons had silencers.

38:17.198 --> 38:18.665
Why did they try to take us out?

38:18.725 --> 38:20.121
We had what Liam wanted.

38:20.323 --> 38:23.218
- Maybe he got what he wanted elsewhere.
- You were a loose end.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.836
Motel on The Strip.

38:31.485 --> 38:32.485
Clear.

38:44.305 --> 38:45.606
Four blank passports.

38:47.521 --> 38:49.650
Four suitcases filled with weapons.

38:50.227 --> 38:52.104
Enough C-4 to bring down a building.

38:52.193 --> 38:53.340
Room's still booked.

38:53.676 --> 38:56.676
That means whoever Liam's supplying
is probably coming back to collect this.

38:57.789 --> 38:59.039
Liam's a ghost.

38:59.621 --> 39:01.237
They've probably never met him.

39:03.165 --> 39:04.165
Probably.

39:07.465 --> 39:09.266
Get any more hits
on our secret thingy?

39:10.008 --> 39:11.419
Do you know how busy I've been?

39:11.546 --> 39:12.992
I know how busy you've been.

39:13.553 --> 39:14.553
Just asking.

39:14.923 --> 39:17.051
We got one hit, but it is a doozy.

39:19.616 --> 39:20.641
Guy on the right,

39:20.905 --> 39:23.998
Michael Rivkin,
our supposed Israeli banker.

39:24.224 --> 39:26.980
Guy on the left, Director of Mossad,

39:27.061 --> 39:28.273
Eli David,

39:28.575 --> 39:30.978
- also known as...
- Ziva's father.

39:31.940 --> 39:33.237
She must know Rivkin.

39:33.318 --> 39:34.403
You don't ask her.

39:36.514 --> 39:37.991
You don't breathe a word of this.

39:47.574 --> 39:48.668
I mean it.

39:52.482 --> 39:54.132
Liam Patrick Coil,

39:54.213 --> 39:55.982
former IRA arms dealer.

39:56.042 --> 39:59.234
Raised money and smuggled arms
into Northern Ireland in the '90s.

39:59.594 --> 40:01.906
After the peace treaty,
he went freelance.

40:02.578 --> 40:05.644
He sold weapons everywhere
from Chechnya to the Horn of Africa.

40:06.162 --> 40:07.439
Supplying terrorists.

40:08.502 --> 40:11.377
- How come we've never heard of him?
- He's been living in New York.

40:11.437 --> 40:13.485
Fake job, fake name, fake life...

40:15.070 --> 40:16.347
It's called a legend.

40:16.821 --> 40:18.846
It's a word coined by the Stasi,

40:20.114 --> 40:22.536
the East German secret police
back during the Cold War.

40:24.155 --> 40:26.049
Now, their idea was to create
a cover so deep

40:26.109 --> 40:27.964
that it could stand up
to any scrutiny.

40:28.702 --> 40:31.461
Passports, documents, work papers...

40:33.425 --> 40:35.275
even family histories.

40:36.442 --> 40:37.786
And none of it true.

40:45.296 --> 40:46.585
All a...

40:47.141 --> 40:48.141
legend.

41:01.077 --> 41:03.577
- Thanks for holding that.
- You're welcome, Tony.

41:03.749 --> 41:06.578
Never thought I'd say this,
but I almost miss McGee. Almost.

41:08.054 --> 41:10.387
- What about you? You miss him?
- Yes, I do.

41:11.158 --> 41:12.836
Miss anyone else? Gibbs?

41:13.151 --> 41:14.151
Some.

41:14.351 --> 41:15.991
What about
your friend from Tel Aviv?

41:16.960 --> 41:18.008
I'm just saying.

41:19.688 --> 41:21.130
Yes. I miss Michael, too.

41:22.473 --> 41:25.181
When he called the other day,
I thought he must have been here.

41:28.577 --> 41:29.577
No.

41:30.003 --> 41:32.276
Sadly, Michael is not here.

42:04.518 --> 42:06.004
I've been expecting you.

42:06.532 --> 42:09.120
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Liam.
