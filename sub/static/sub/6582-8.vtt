00:00.117 --> 00:01.875
Previously on The Royals...

00:01.900 --> 00:03.219
Does this mean anything to you?

00:04.548 --> 00:06.439
She was your father's true love.

00:06.908 --> 00:07.572
She died.

00:07.875 --> 00:10.376
My sister's death
destroyed my family...

00:10.378 --> 00:13.395
and my sister's death
was not an accident.

00:13.397 --> 00:16.347
The day she died, she was
competing in a showjumping event.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.344
When the horse returned,
it was in a sweat.

00:18.369 --> 00:19.251
It was drugged.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.753
She and your mother were rivals.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.288
That's one hell of an accusation!

00:22.290 --> 00:24.323
Our families deserve justice, Ted!

00:24.325 --> 00:26.358
And they deserve to be punished.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.861
You never actually
answered my question.

00:28.863 --> 00:32.430
What happened after so many years
that meant you had to change careers?

00:32.433 --> 00:34.400
I'll tell you what. You guess it

00:34.402 --> 00:35.946
and I'll tell you all about it.

00:37.772 --> 00:40.806
If this was all just about
taking things from me...

00:41.943 --> 00:43.576
Here, take these.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.296
Violet, I love you.

00:47.298 --> 00:49.615
Did you just say, "love"?

00:49.617 --> 00:51.150
Yes. I love you.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.918
You know what's not helping?

00:52.920 --> 00:54.703
The fact that you never said it back.

00:54.705 --> 00:56.222
You need to breathe.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.908
My grandmother gave me something
that made it all better.

00:58.910 --> 01:01.994
I'm going to get it for you.
I want you to have it.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.930
I'll be back before the broadcast.
I promise.

01:04.932 --> 01:08.284
Cyrus has picked out
an engagement ring.

01:08.286 --> 01:10.269
Thanks to your Bill of Succession,

01:10.271 --> 01:12.571
if they're still married when he dies,

01:12.573 --> 01:15.874
she will be the sole reigning monarch.

01:16.611 --> 01:19.578
I'm not close to you, Helena,
because you're my daughter.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.780
I'm close to you because
you're the Queen.

01:25.562 --> 01:27.032
I think Mum killed someone.

We're just a family, you know?

01:42.503 --> 01:43.525
Like any family.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.657
And then we're not.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.892
(CYRUS) You're lying! (HELENA) I'm not!

01:49.894 --> 01:53.746
(CYRUS) Tell the truth or you won't live
to see another lying, cheating day!

01:53.748 --> 01:55.364
(HELENA) Get off me!

01:55.366 --> 01:58.417
(CYRUS) You think I'm stupid?
You think I'm paranoid?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.085
I think you're coked out of your mind

02:00.087 --> 02:01.553
and don't know what you're doing!

02:01.555 --> 02:04.356
You've been threatened ever
since I fell in love with her.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.925
Cyrus, remove the Great Sword
of State from my throat

02:06.927 --> 02:09.695
or you are going to lose your
last remaining testicle.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.829
Ow!

02:10.830 --> 02:12.865
You kicked my balls!

02:12.867 --> 02:15.701
- I kicked your ball.
- You bitch!

02:15.703 --> 02:17.519
You tell me what you did with her!

02:17.521 --> 02:18.587
Tell me!

02:18.643 --> 02:19.758
Agh!

02:20.775 --> 02:21.415
(Sighs)

02:22.009 --> 02:24.306
People are sleeping, for Godsakes!

02:26.380 --> 02:29.181
Cyrus, get up, you're not that hurt.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.884
- Stop being so dramatic.

02:46.077 --> 02:46.751
Yeah.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.235
Your Majesty?

02:51.122 --> 02:52.738
You believe this shit?

02:52.740 --> 02:55.074
- Slow down.
- She attacked me.

02:55.076 --> 02:57.042
Hit me over the head
with a goddamn vase.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.410
She could have killed me.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.246
The Grand Duchess claims she was
defending Her Majesty the Queen.

03:01.248 --> 03:03.349
They did something, Pryce. To Violet.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.983
They're in cahoots, those two.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.885
Your Majesty, please, take a seat.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.064
(Sighs)

03:10.057 --> 03:13.275
You say Violet's gone missing. Okay.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.060
When was the last time
you heard from her?

03:15.062 --> 03:16.495
Last night.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.697
She said she wanted to
get something for me,

03:18.699 --> 03:19.868
she said she loved me...

03:19.893 --> 03:22.101
or at least she implied that she did,

03:22.103 --> 03:24.036
and then she said she'd
be straight back.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.504
And this was before your speech?

03:25.506 --> 03:27.139
Yes, but she never came back.

03:27.141 --> 03:30.509
So you ingested copious
quantities of various drugs,

03:30.511 --> 03:33.362
chased them with a 60-year-old
single malt Scotch

03:33.364 --> 03:36.065
and attacked the Queen of England
with the Great Sword of State.

03:36.067 --> 03:38.117
At which point, the
Grand Duchess of Oxford

03:38.119 --> 03:40.452
broke a 15th-century Imperial
vase over your head,

03:40.454 --> 03:41.820
rendering you unconscious.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.023
Would you say that was an
accurate account of things?

03:45.751 --> 03:47.499
It sounds worse when you say it.

03:49.130 --> 03:51.563
Due to Your Majesty's
recent public appearances,

03:51.565 --> 03:54.099
there have been a higher than
usual number of threats.

03:54.101 --> 03:57.102
I would like to restrict access
today, monitor things closely.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.938
All delivery personnel. Flowers. Food.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.790
- Anyone in and out.
- Boring.

04:02.321 --> 04:03.342
But...

04:03.806 --> 04:05.043
do you think these threats

04:05.045 --> 04:08.030
have anything to do with
Violet's disappearance?

04:08.759 --> 04:10.916
I couldn't live with myself
if that were the case.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.684
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

04:14.025 --> 04:16.755
Your Majesty, why do you
think the Queen is involved?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.048
Well, she knew about the ring.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.627
I selected an engagement ring

04:21.629 --> 04:23.962
from the royal collection
and she knew about it.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.715
If I were to marry, she
would no longer be Queen

04:26.717 --> 04:28.283
nor next in line to the throne.

04:29.048 --> 04:32.671
She'd stop at nothing
to protect her station.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.640
Even murder?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.942
People kill people all
the time around here.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.744
Where've you been, Pryce?

04:39.814 --> 04:42.948
Sorry, that was insensitive
considering all you've been through.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.517
You've had a rough morning.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.437
Let's retrace your steps.

04:48.439 --> 04:50.856
Following your broadcast
yesterday, what did you do?

04:51.659 --> 04:55.837
I was worried about Violet so I came
back to my room and put some music on.

04:56.197 --> 04:56.993
What then?

I didn't scare her off, if
that's what you're thinking.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.568
- Did she say it back?

06:09.889 --> 06:11.092

Do you think that's it?

06:17.995 --> 06:21.213
You haven't known her long and already
you've picked out an engagement ring

06:21.215 --> 06:22.342
and told her you love her.

06:23.942 --> 06:25.217

12:03.023 --> 12:05.958
and can apprehend her immediately
if that's what you'd wish.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.727
Of course, Mr. Frost would
be implicated as well.

12:09.530 --> 12:12.831
Also, I'd like to apologize personally.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.535
Why you?

12:16.537 --> 12:18.804
For suggesting you phone a friend.

12:19.356 --> 12:22.107
I should have known that all
your friends would be shit.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.580
There's a slight chance you
might amuse me, Mr. Hill.

12:30.651 --> 12:34.102
You were on the trail
of a master criminal...

12:34.104 --> 12:35.554
No.

12:35.556 --> 12:37.873
I'll guess it eventually.

12:40.461 --> 12:42.310
Wow.

12:42.312 --> 12:44.196
It's about time.

12:44.198 --> 12:47.099
- What's about time?
- The drug thing is getting a little old.

12:47.101 --> 12:49.167
Oh! So's the sleeping
with models thing.

12:50.004 --> 12:53.038
Wasn't a great example.
What do you want?

12:53.040 --> 12:55.574
I wanna find out if Mum's an
assassin and I wanna do it now.

12:55.576 --> 12:57.743
I've been up all night and
I'm in a horrible mood.

12:57.745 --> 13:00.262
Well, I've been up all night too, Liam,

13:00.264 --> 13:02.247
and I'm horny, so deal with it.

13:03.584 --> 13:05.417
Fine. Give me the photo.

13:05.419 --> 13:06.651
Stay here.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.270
Why?

13:08.272 --> 13:10.122
Because, believe it or not,

13:10.124 --> 13:12.624
Mum and I had a really
great day yesterday,

13:12.626 --> 13:14.926
and I want to give her
the benefit of the doubt

13:14.928 --> 13:17.079
before we start calling her a murderer.

13:17.081 --> 13:18.530
I'll be back.

13:24.538 --> 13:27.823
Cyrus, get off, you're not that hurt.

13:27.825 --> 13:30.809
- Stop being so dramatic.
(ELEANOR) Mum?

13:32.246 --> 13:34.329
(Door opens)

13:34.948 --> 13:36.882
Ah! Eleanor.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.151
- What, darling?
- What's going on?

13:39.153 --> 13:40.619
What do you mean?

13:40.621 --> 13:42.220
You seem shifty.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.489
Yeah, well, you seem bulimic.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.425
What do you want?

13:46.427 --> 13:48.060
Uh... I...

13:48.062 --> 13:50.912
I found this photo of you and
I want to show it to you.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.581
Look how pretty you look.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.600
Ah... Well, long time ago.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.702
Mm-hm.

13:57.704 --> 14:00.555
Who's that? That girl.

14:01.391 --> 14:03.375
Hmm...

14:03.377 --> 14:04.743
I don't recall.

14:04.745 --> 14:06.545
Just some girl.

14:09.450 --> 14:11.116
Yeah, okay.

14:11.118 --> 14:14.352
But if you leave it with me, I could
try to find out more if you like.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.507
No, that's okay.

14:20.594 --> 14:23.361
Eleanor, we had a nice day
yesterday, didn't we?

14:24.731 --> 14:26.765
Did we?

14:39.012 --> 14:41.079
- Well?
- You were right.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.014
The bitch did it.

14:45.511 --> 14:46.556
What do we do now?

14:55.608 --> 14:58.046
She'd do anything to protect
her station.

14:58.612 --> 14:59.693
Even murder?

14:59.718 --> 15:02.264
People kill people all
the time around here.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.666
Where have you been, Pryce?

15:05.070 --> 15:06.450
Sorry, that was insensitive.

15:07.271 --> 15:08.804
Are you sure?

15:08.806 --> 15:10.423
They said the word "murder".

15:10.425 --> 15:12.274
So do you think Ted knows about it?

15:12.276 --> 15:15.678
I asked him to look into the
Domino symbol on my medallion.

15:16.614 --> 15:18.147
Maybe he knows more than we do.

15:18.149 --> 15:20.416
And, of course, Cyrus knows about it.

15:21.185 --> 15:22.785
Ahhh, I knew it!

15:23.588 --> 15:25.588
She lied to me about that photo.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.556
Straight to my face.

15:27.558 --> 15:29.809
And then she had the
balls to say to me,

15:29.811 --> 15:32.862
"We had a nice day yesterday,
didn't we, Eleanor?"

15:32.864 --> 15:36.832
"Yeah, Mum, a great day, right up until
I found out you killed someone!"

15:38.086 --> 15:39.935
I'm sorry, Len.

15:41.722 --> 15:44.573
I guess I'll head back to my
creepy clean room and get high.

15:45.159 --> 15:48.644
Let me know when you want to confront
our murderous mother, won't you?

15:55.570 --> 15:57.787
It just keeps getting
worse, doesn't it?

(Coughs)

17:32.483 --> 17:35.184
Ted, I didn't know you cared.

17:35.686 --> 17:37.753
I found these outside
your door, Your Highness.

17:37.755 --> 17:39.722
I think the staff didn't
want to disturb you.

17:39.724 --> 17:42.157
I wanted to speak with
you in confidence

17:42.159 --> 17:44.393
about that symbol on your necklace.

17:44.395 --> 17:45.844
Okay...

17:45.846 --> 17:49.715
Dominique Stuart was a woman
from your father's past,

17:49.717 --> 17:51.200
before he met your mother.

17:51.202 --> 17:55.104
As a matter of fact, they had something
of a rivalry, she and your mum.

17:55.106 --> 17:57.072
What does that have to
do with my pendant?

17:57.074 --> 17:59.441
Look, Liam, I have to
walk a fine line here

17:59.443 --> 18:01.143
between personal and professional

18:01.145 --> 18:02.645
but, in confidence,

18:02.647 --> 18:05.347
I think you need to ask
your mother that question.

18:06.284 --> 18:09.568
Your father was a man who
believed in the truth.

18:10.238 --> 18:12.321
He'd want you to know the truth.

18:12.323 --> 18:15.157
I think he admired you most
when you insisted on it.

18:15.159 --> 18:16.825
What is the truth?

18:16.827 --> 18:19.261
Talk to your mother. Be resilient.

18:19.897 --> 18:21.230
And, son...

18:22.199 --> 18:24.266
..I'll always be there for you.

18:31.175 --> 18:33.142
We need to speak with you, Mum.

18:33.844 --> 18:35.828
About the woman in the photo.

18:35.830 --> 18:37.212
About all of it.

18:38.049 --> 18:40.199
She was your father's first love.

18:40.201 --> 18:42.685
- And she died.
- She was killed.

18:42.687 --> 18:45.387
- She was thrown from her horse.
- Which you poisoned.

18:46.574 --> 18:49.191
- That's not true.
- We've been through a lot, Mum.

18:49.193 --> 18:50.659
- Robert's death.
- Dad's death.

18:50.661 --> 18:53.312
- The paternity scandal.
- But it's time to tell us the truth.

18:53.314 --> 18:54.563
I'm telling you the truth.

18:54.565 --> 18:57.633
Oh, please, Mum, just once! For once.

18:57.635 --> 18:59.418
Her horse threw her.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.170
Her horse was drugged.

19:01.839 --> 19:03.689
- Maybe it was.
- Maybe it was?

19:03.691 --> 19:06.225
- You killed her, didn't you?
- I did no such thing.

19:06.227 --> 19:08.644
- You did it so you could be Queen.
- That's not true.

19:08.646 --> 19:10.312
- You did!
- Admit you did it!

19:10.314 --> 19:12.231
I did it!

19:13.838 --> 19:17.088
And you two spoiled brats
should thank me for it.

19:22.832 --> 19:27.623
Don't look at me like that...
All naïve and lofty.

19:29.858 --> 19:33.059
Do you think that monarchies
just happen? Hmm?

19:33.061 --> 19:36.596
Do you think that queens just happen?

19:36.598 --> 19:38.231
Because they don't.

19:38.450 --> 19:40.367
They need somebody to make it happen

19:40.369 --> 19:43.003
and I made this...

19:43.005 --> 19:44.538
Mother, that's enough.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.973
- You poisoned her horse?
- How could you do that?

19:46.975 --> 19:48.809
With a great deal of planning, darling.

19:48.811 --> 19:52.712
I know how much you love your
horses and I apologize for that.

19:54.683 --> 19:56.483
Look at the way you're
all looking at me.

19:57.119 --> 19:59.519
Look, when you are older

19:59.521 --> 20:02.989
and you understand
your place in history,

20:02.991 --> 20:05.659
this will all have been worth it.

20:06.628 --> 20:09.496
- Right, Helena?
- I said that's enough.

20:10.382 --> 20:13.900
Oh, I think I shall take my tea
in the ornamental gardens.

20:13.902 --> 20:16.803
You know, the roses were
planted by Queen Victoria.

20:24.980 --> 20:26.646
I'm sorry.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.449
You're sorry?

20:29.451 --> 20:32.285
You're sorry Grandma murdered
some poor innocent girl?

20:32.287 --> 20:34.271
And poisoned her horse.

20:34.273 --> 20:36.957
You're sorry that everything
we are is built on murder?

20:37.876 --> 20:39.809
I'm sorry that you have to know.

20:41.096 --> 20:42.963
I've waited 30 years for this day.

20:42.965 --> 20:46.183
I thought that once the truth was out,

20:46.185 --> 20:48.702
a weight would be lifted
off my shoulders.

20:49.705 --> 20:51.938
But now...

20:51.940 --> 20:53.907
looking at your faces...

20:55.210 --> 20:57.110
..I feel sad that you know.

20:58.647 --> 21:00.080
That you have to know.

21:01.984 --> 21:03.950
The truth is...

21:03.952 --> 21:05.986
the weight's twice as much.

21:06.588 --> 21:08.588
And um...

21:10.726 --> 21:11.958
..I'm just sorry.

21:28.227 --> 21:30.343
The children will be fine.

21:30.345 --> 21:32.462
No-one will be fine.

21:32.464 --> 21:34.631
Oh, come on, Helena.

21:34.633 --> 21:37.050
Don't lose sight of the prize.

21:37.519 --> 21:41.488
With that girl out of the
way, accident or not,

21:41.490 --> 21:44.057
you're still in line for the throne.

21:45.360 --> 21:47.093
You mean "accident".

21:48.330 --> 21:50.096
Or not.

21:50.933 --> 21:52.899
Look, the way Cyrus is going,

21:52.901 --> 21:55.835
I think he's probably going
to die of a broken heart.

21:55.837 --> 21:59.773
I can't wait to try and get a lovely
dress designed for your coronation.

22:02.177 --> 22:04.377
Walk away.

22:04.379 --> 22:06.613
I beg your pardon?

22:06.615 --> 22:08.381
I said go.

22:08.850 --> 22:10.183
Now.

22:10.769 --> 22:14.120
I hope you have nothing to do with
the disappearance of that girl

22:14.122 --> 22:15.722
but if you do, it's on you.

22:15.724 --> 22:17.490
You understand me?

22:17.492 --> 22:19.326
It always is, Helena.

22:20.195 --> 22:22.462
(Scoffs) It always is.

22:22.581 --> 22:24.064
It always is?

22:24.066 --> 22:26.483
You don't get to say that!
You hear me, Mother?

22:26.485 --> 22:28.568
You don't get to say
that and walk away.

22:28.570 --> 22:32.372
Because it never is! It's never on you.
It's always on me...

22:32.374 --> 22:35.959
..and it has been for the last
30 years but now it's on you...

22:35.961 --> 22:37.677
"They always take the good ones."

22:37.679 --> 22:39.596
- ..on you!
- (Door slams)

22:39.598 --> 22:43.316
Dad loved that girl and they killed her.
We killed her.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.803
What are we gonna do?

22:47.389 --> 22:49.105
I don't know.

22:49.858 --> 22:53.259
If we say anything, the Grand
Duchess of Oxford goes to prison.

22:53.962 --> 22:55.895
Yeah, but if we don't, who are we?

22:56.565 --> 22:59.633
All this time, I hated
Mum and I loved Gran.

23:01.436 --> 23:03.269
She bought me with her diamonds.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.323
Maybe Dad was right.

23:08.427 --> 23:10.343
Maybe we should just end it.

23:12.447 --> 23:15.515
Cyrus has taken human rights
back to the Dark Ages.

23:16.301 --> 23:18.435
People will vote for the referendum.

23:20.522 --> 23:22.522
We could take it all away from him.

23:22.524 --> 23:25.258
You decide, Liam. I
can't do it anymore.

23:26.294 --> 23:27.827
Yes, you can.

23:28.163 --> 23:30.130
You're stronger than all of us.

23:32.968 --> 23:34.651
Not today, I'm not.

23:39.708 --> 23:41.741
Your Majesty?

23:48.083 --> 23:50.116
We've located her vehicle.

23:51.920 --> 23:55.522
It was abandoned in a very
secluded area off the M25.

23:56.058 --> 23:58.324
There are signs of foul play.

23:58.326 --> 23:59.559
She's dead?

23:59.695 --> 24:02.295
She's missing, but all
indications are...

24:02.297 --> 24:04.397
Then there's hope. She could be alive.

24:04.399 --> 24:07.967
Your Majesty, there was blood in
the vehicle and no sign of Violet.

24:07.969 --> 24:12.005
No hospitals have reported treating
or admitting anyone with her name

24:12.007 --> 24:13.773
or matching her description.

24:13.775 --> 24:15.825
In my professional opinion,

24:15.827 --> 24:18.211
we're looking for a body,
not a missing person.

24:19.931 --> 24:23.400
Most of the personal effects
in the vehicle are evidence.

24:23.402 --> 24:25.935
But I thought this might matter to you.

24:30.358 --> 24:35.261

The King of England foraging
the palace for a drink.

25:14.691 --> 25:17.074
There's nothing I wouldn't
believe right now.

25:20.546 --> 25:22.380
Did you know they killed her?

25:24.917 --> 25:26.534
What do you know about it?

25:26.536 --> 25:29.787
Just that my father loved her and the
Grand Duchess poisoned her horse.

25:29.789 --> 25:31.589
What the hell are you talking about?

25:31.591 --> 25:33.691
Dominique Stuart.

25:34.494 --> 25:36.160
Oh.

25:37.013 --> 25:39.363
No, I didn't know. I thought
it was an accident.

25:40.083 --> 25:41.565
Who did you think I meant?

25:42.235 --> 25:44.235
Violet.

25:45.938 --> 25:47.688
She's missing.

25:48.941 --> 25:50.775
I think they killed her too.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.209
But it can't be true.

25:52.211 --> 25:54.078
Would you put it past them?

25:56.916 --> 25:58.883
- Here.
- Keep it.

26:01.721 --> 26:04.689
Looks different from the inside,
doesn't it, being King?

26:07.293 --> 26:08.893
Be glad I took it from you.

26:09.662 --> 26:11.462
Trust me.

26:11.464 --> 26:13.364
Cyrus, I know you're
sick and heartbroken...

26:13.366 --> 26:15.666
- You don't know shit.
- I know you want revenge.

26:16.202 --> 26:19.487
Figure out another way to deal with this.
If you don't, I won't protect you.

26:19.489 --> 26:20.821
It has to stop.

26:20.823 --> 26:24.308
King John was the first King of England

26:24.310 --> 26:26.093
to be accused of murder.

26:26.896 --> 26:30.164
Ivan the Terrible massacred thousands.

26:30.166 --> 26:32.316
King Herod ordered the killing

26:32.318 --> 26:35.319
of every male infant
under the age of two...

26:36.356 --> 26:38.522
..and if Jesus Christ himself

26:38.524 --> 26:41.525
hadn't been slumming it in a manger...

26:41.527 --> 26:44.528
he would have slaughtered him too

26:44.530 --> 26:46.764
because a younger, faster king

26:46.766 --> 26:48.833
was coming to take what he had.

26:49.068 --> 26:53.137
You think this place is
made of wood and stone?

26:54.807 --> 26:56.707
It's built on blood.

26:57.210 --> 26:59.410
Every empire is.

27:01.531 --> 27:02.780
(Sighs)

27:04.267 --> 27:05.950
I'm sorry about Violet.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.170
I hope she comes home.

27:15.578 --> 27:17.461
She won't.

27:19.399 --> 27:21.465
They always take the good ones.

27:26.105 --> 27:28.038
I have a question for you.

27:34.781 --> 27:36.947
Was any of it worth it?

27:43.423 --> 27:46.791
You've stood on that podium for 30 years,
knowing you weren't quite good enough.

27:46.793 --> 27:48.492
Knowing your crown was a lie.

27:49.429 --> 27:51.162
What did you get out of it?

27:51.164 --> 27:53.631
What good have you put into the world?

27:53.633 --> 27:55.065
- My children.
- (Scoffs)

27:55.401 --> 27:58.002
And then you declared us illegitimate.

27:59.972 --> 28:01.872
You need to deal with your mother.

28:01.874 --> 28:05.042
She acts like her entire life has been
one big sacrifice for this family.

28:05.044 --> 28:06.577
It hasn't been.

28:06.579 --> 28:09.346
She poisoned that horse because
she wanted to be someone.

28:09.348 --> 28:11.248
Not for you, for her.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.983
It's despicable.

28:12.985 --> 28:16.020
- How's Eleanor?
- I don't know, Mum.

28:17.356 --> 28:18.756
How's Violet?

28:19.559 --> 28:22.460
Tell me now if you had anything to
do with the fact she's missing.

28:22.462 --> 28:24.528
- I didn't!
- And the Duchess?

28:24.922 --> 28:25.731
I don't know.

28:25.756 --> 28:27.765
Mum, what's going on?
Dominique and now this?

28:27.767 --> 28:29.467
- Ssh! Keep your voice down.
- Why?

28:29.469 --> 28:32.736
Because we don't know what
that woman will do next!

28:32.738 --> 28:35.122
Besides, we don't know about Violet.

28:35.124 --> 28:38.008
The fact there's even a possibility
says a lot about this family.

28:38.010 --> 28:39.894
(Sighs)

28:41.647 --> 28:44.882
I think Dominique's family killed
your father and your brother.

28:45.768 --> 28:47.785
No. They didn't.

28:47.787 --> 28:49.220
How do you know that?

28:49.222 --> 28:51.055
It's a long story.

28:51.457 --> 28:53.324
For all we know, Grandma did it.

28:59.398 --> 29:01.065
Deal with your homicidal mother.

29:01.067 --> 29:03.868
I need to try to fix a 30-year tragedy.

29:03.870 --> 29:05.436
And, Mum,

29:05.438 --> 29:09.206
if anything comes up about Dominique...
we won't lie about it.

29:10.326 --> 29:12.643
Good. Don't.

29:28.227 --> 29:31.262
It was driving me crazy like that.

29:31.264 --> 29:33.631
As you wish. I just
wanted to check on you.

29:33.633 --> 29:36.233
- I'll leave you to it.
- James?

29:36.435 --> 29:38.302
Come in.

29:41.624 --> 29:44.441
You are who you say you are, yes?

29:44.443 --> 29:46.277
As much as I can be, Your Highness.

29:46.279 --> 29:49.613
You're not here to rob me or dominate
me or have sex with my mother?

29:49.615 --> 29:52.283
It wasn't initially why
I took the job, no,

29:52.285 --> 29:53.784
but, of course, I understand

29:53.786 --> 29:56.954
if the requirements of the position
change from time to time...

29:59.025 --> 30:00.291
Thank you.

30:02.178 --> 30:03.994
My father would have liked you, Mr.
Hill.

30:05.114 --> 30:06.830
I would like to have known him.

30:08.200 --> 30:12.002
Maybe you quit the force for a
wayward girl who needed your help.

30:16.008 --> 30:17.708
Did I guess it?

30:27.203 --> 30:30.020
- Her name is Sarah.
- You have a daughter...

30:30.456 --> 30:31.789
I do now.

30:38.631 --> 30:40.798
Like you, I had an older brother.

30:41.934 --> 30:45.336
And, like you, I lost him
far too early in life.

30:45.972 --> 30:47.838
And Sarah was his daughter.

30:49.842 --> 30:51.275
One day, your phone rings

30:51.277 --> 30:54.578
and there's a voice,
compassionate but routine,

30:54.580 --> 30:57.848
telling you your brother
and his wife are gone.

30:58.884 --> 31:01.285
And then there's this other life.

31:02.054 --> 31:05.122
And her eyes are looking
to you for answers

31:05.124 --> 31:07.591
and food and comfort.

31:07.960 --> 31:11.712
And you realize everything you
thought you knew about the world,

31:11.714 --> 31:13.597
you didn't know.

31:14.367 --> 31:15.866
And you don't know.

31:15.868 --> 31:18.369
And if you're like me,
you're angry about it

31:18.371 --> 31:20.437
because your life was your own,

31:20.439 --> 31:23.974
and your career was about knowing
and certainty and clarity.

31:24.877 --> 31:26.894
And now there's none.

31:29.181 --> 31:31.815
And this little girl... Hmm!

31:31.817 --> 31:33.334
She couldn't even speak then,

31:33.336 --> 31:36.403
but if she could, she would have said,

31:36.405 --> 31:40.057
"Calm your racing mind, rest
your weary heart, old man,

31:40.059 --> 31:42.092
because I'm here to save you."

31:43.963 --> 31:46.096
That's exactly what she did.

31:46.932 --> 31:51.435
I spent 27 years telling myself
I was making a difference.

31:52.888 --> 31:56.473
It took about six seconds for her
to show me the wonder of the world.

31:59.045 --> 32:00.611
The brilliance...

32:00.613 --> 32:02.446
and the goodness.

32:06.318 --> 32:08.986
And then one day, just
a few years later,

32:08.988 --> 32:12.056
when we're watching some of
that brilliance leave us

32:12.058 --> 32:13.857
with the passing of your father...

32:14.927 --> 32:18.011
she turns to me and she says,

32:19.298 --> 32:21.448
"You should help them, Daddy.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.801
They look sad."

32:28.140 --> 32:33.026
So, yeah, I quit the force for a
wayward girl who needed my help.

32:34.714 --> 32:36.630
That's nice detective work, Princess.

32:36.916 --> 32:38.415
(Sniffles)

32:39.301 --> 32:40.851
Who's the crack detective now?

32:40.853 --> 32:42.086
(Laughs)

32:42.872 --> 32:45.355
You do amuse me, Mr. Hill.

32:46.192 --> 32:48.358
You can call me James.

32:50.045 --> 32:51.962
Thank you.

33:02.462 --> 33:04.212
(Sighs)

33:30.114 --> 33:32.214
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:35.920 --> 33:36.918
Did he follow you?

33:37.489 --> 33:38.958
I don't know. I don't think so.

33:39.114 --> 33:40.797
How did he know about the
tunnels and the park?

33:41.032 --> 33:43.450
Like everything else, I
guess, he just knows.

33:43.836 --> 33:45.252
I want to meet him.

33:45.254 --> 33:47.021
That's absolutely not gonna happen.

33:47.023 --> 33:49.223
Then I want you to tell
him something for me.

33:49.743 --> 33:50.759
Tell him I'm sorry.

33:50.761 --> 33:52.227
So your mother did it?

33:52.229 --> 33:54.672
No. But my family did.

33:55.566 --> 33:58.300
Sort of. I wanna show you something.

But I will.

36:54.678 --> 36:56.745
You had her for tea yesterday

36:56.747 --> 36:58.780
and you poisoned her
just like that horse.

36:58.782 --> 37:01.416

..good people have
simply lost their way.

Difficult day.

38:23.133 --> 38:24.899
It occurs to me...

38:25.602 --> 38:27.135
..that no-one has lost more

38:27.137 --> 38:29.270
or sacrificed more than you have.

sympathy because you don't ask for it.

don't need it sometimes.

over the loss of his son

40:14.144 --> 40:17.679
and he carried the perspective
that only a grieving father can.

40:19.449 --> 40:21.282
I've been told I have his tenacity.

40:21.284 --> 40:22.884
I tell you this,

40:22.886 --> 40:24.652
I'm not half the man he was.

40:25.722 --> 40:29.991
One of the things he told me before
he died... was to choose love.

40:33.296 --> 40:35.129
And to choose my own path.

40:36.983 --> 40:39.067
Well, I love England with all my heart.

40:41.071 --> 40:43.771
And while my father was on
a path towards a republic,

40:44.474 --> 40:46.207
I know in my heart that this monarchy

40:46.209 --> 40:48.676
can be relevant and inspiring
and visionary again.

40:48.678 --> 40:50.378
I truly do.

40:55.352 --> 40:57.685
"To take arms against
a sea of troubles...

40:58.822 --> 41:01.189
..and, by opposing, end them."

41:03.793 --> 41:07.028
Too many good people have been lost
for us not to make things right.

41:10.066 --> 41:12.100
For them.

41:15.405 --> 41:17.455
And for you.
