00:32.866 --> 00:36.802
Okay, Roy McCormick fan or not, you gotta
admit, the guy is a Cinderella story.

00:36.903 --> 00:40.202
He grows up without two nickels
to rub together, and look at him now.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.433
He's led Ohio Polytech
to three championships.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.636
He is one of the best coaches
in college basketball.

00:45.745 --> 00:47.645
And he's also the best paid,
but let's be realistic.

00:47.747 --> 00:50.443
Coach Roy has not won
in, what, forever.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.129
In my opinion, he's more interested in
endorsements than winning basketball games.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.857
It's that simple.

01:08.001 --> 01:11.459
Hey! Hi.
I'm Coach Roy.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.732
When I get hot under the collar...

01:13.840 --> 01:16.001
I cool off with Cool Breeze.

01:34.527 --> 01:37.655
<i> See, Coach Roy is slippin',</i>
<i>because right now... </i>

01:37.764 --> 01:40.824
<i>his best statistic on the season-</i>
<i>eight technical fouls in his last eight games. </i>

01:40.934 --> 01:42.765
<i>That's hardly championship coaching. </i>

01:42.869 --> 01:46.100
<i>You ate eight hamburgers at lunch. </i>

02:01.187 --> 02:04.179
Look, the fact is this.
Roy has lost touch with the fundamentals...

02:04.290 --> 02:06.281
and he's also
lost touch with his team.

02:08.461 --> 02:12.158
Y'all can take some pictures, but I'm not gonna
be able to sign any autographs right now.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.756
As you can see,
I'm very busy.

02:14.868 --> 02:18.031
Roy better get his stuff together,
because otherwise, he'll be coaching at DeVry.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.197
And they don't even have a basketball team.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.069
And that's the joke, see?

02:45.765 --> 02:48.700
<i>Okay, guys, real important game today. </i>

02:48.801 --> 02:50.735
<i>I need you to be 100%.</i>

02:50.837 --> 02:54.933
<i>Unfortunately, I can't be there. I'm doin'</i>
<i>a photo shoot for</i> Details <i>magazine. </i>

02:55.041 --> 02:59.171
<i>It's gonna run late. I'll be there</i>
<i>at halftime, and you'd better not lose... </i>

02:59.279 --> 03:01.611
because losing makes me look bad.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.367
<i>Coach Roy cannot be happy right now, Jack. </i>

04:03.476 --> 04:06.570
<i>His team has a lot of work to do,</i>
<i>and not much time to do it. </i>

04:06.679 --> 04:09.307
It is crunch time.
This is where we're gonna find out...

04:09.415 --> 04:11.406
what these two teams
and their coaches are really made of.

04:13.453 --> 04:15.853
What are you callin'?

04:15.955 --> 04:20.153
What are you callin', Earl?
Earl, what is that? What is that?

04:20.260 --> 04:23.161
Keep it up, Roy.
Just one more word.

04:23.263 --> 04:27.063
<i>Hey, Coach, this is my nest!</i>
<i>This is my nest!</i>

04:27.166 --> 04:31.193
<i>You need to do an endorsement for Altoids. </i>
<i>Your breath is</i> humming!

04:31.304 --> 04:33.772
Hey, clown.

04:33.873 --> 04:37.502
You keep runnin' your mouth, I'm gonna
come over there and rearrange your beak.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.374
You talkin' smack?
You talkin' smack, huh? You talkin' smack?

04:40.480 --> 04:42.038
Shut up.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.920
- No basket.
- What?

04:49.022 --> 04:52.048
Why don't we play jacks?
'Cause we're not playin' basketball.

04:52.158 --> 04:54.854
Technical foul, Coach Roy.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.020
I- I was way over there!

04:57.130 --> 04:59.030
That's two.
You're out of here!

04:59.132 --> 05:01.430
- Just because- Did I do this?
- Don't touch my whistle.

05:01.534 --> 05:03.434
Did I do that?
Did I do that?

05:03.536 --> 05:05.800
- That's why you give me a tech!
<i>- Hit the showers. </i>

05:05.905 --> 05:07.964
No, you hit the showers, Earl!
You hit the showers!

05:08.074 --> 05:09.974
I'm not hittin' no showers!

05:10.076 --> 05:14.137
Yeah! Kick him out! Kick him out!

05:14.247 --> 05:16.772
Y'all didn't even ask me what went on.
Y'all just snatched me.

05:16.883 --> 05:19.716
You know what?

05:19.819 --> 05:22.379
Victor?

05:22.488 --> 05:25.889
Coach Roy killed Victor!

05:25.992 --> 05:30.156
You're crazy!

05:30.263 --> 05:32.754
Victor? Victor?

05:41.441 --> 05:44.842
I feel bad.
I feel real bad.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.844
You know...

05:46.946 --> 05:49.414
out there havin' temper tantrums
and arguin' with the refs.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.642
Man, I should know
better than that.

05:51.751 --> 05:54.652
You represent everything
that's wrong with college sports today.

05:54.754 --> 05:57.917
<i>You don't care about the players. </i>
<i>You don't care about the game. </i>

05:58.024 --> 06:00.652
<i>If things don't go your way,</i>
<i>you explode like a spoiled child. </i>

06:00.760 --> 06:02.591
Look, if you're gonna fine me,
fine me, man.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.856
How much?
'Cause I ain't got all day.

06:04.964 --> 06:07.455
It's time for me to bounce.
What's happenin'?

06:08.868 --> 06:11.302
It is with such pleasure
that I say...

06:11.404 --> 06:13.463
<i>that you, Roy McCormick... </i>

06:13.573 --> 06:17.771
that you're officially banned from coaching
in the N.C.B.A. for the remainder of your life.

06:21.013 --> 06:23.811
You bannin' me, huh?
Yeah. Okay.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.316
I been here longer
than all y'all.

06:26.419 --> 06:30.150
You forgot about the three championships
I won, didn't you, Mr. Vice President? Huh?

06:30.256 --> 06:34.317
And now you wanna ban me?
No, I'm bannin' you. I'm bannin' you for life.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.692
- Can he ban us?
- Of course not! Stand up straight.

06:37.797 --> 06:41.631
<i>Excuse me, gentlemen. </i>
<i>"Prior to a lifetime ban... </i>

06:41.734 --> 06:45.067
<i>"offending coach must be granted</i>
<i>an opportunity to demonstrate compliance. </i>

06:45.171 --> 06:48.197
"If offending coach completes the remainder
of the season without any infractions-

06:48.307 --> 06:50.969
<i>"ejections, criminal</i>
<i>malfeasance, etcetera-</i>

06:51.077 --> 06:53.272
<i>he must be readmitted</i>
<i>on a probationary basis. "</i>

06:53.379 --> 06:57.406
In short, you gotta give Roy
one last chance to prove himself.

06:57.517 --> 07:00.543
Yes, but it doesn't say I have to
let him coach out the rest of the year...

07:00.653 --> 07:03.247
in my league.

07:03.356 --> 07:07.417
Watch your temper, Roy.
Good luck finding another team.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.529
We should go.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.736
And then,
I'm gonna smash the guitar.

07:19.839 --> 07:22.603
Good, 'cause if you don't, I will.

07:22.708 --> 07:25.040
Dad call?

07:25.144 --> 07:27.078
He comin' to this game?

07:28.848 --> 07:31.783
Keep practicin', okay?

07:42.795 --> 07:44.695
Come on. We're late.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.191
Hey, hold it.
Hold it.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.737
Okay, look.
I would love to tell you...

07:52.839 --> 07:55.706
that everybody you meet in this life
was gonna be great...

07:55.808 --> 07:58.003
and you could always
count on those people.

07:58.110 --> 08:02.911
That'd be a lie. Your dad's not
a part of our lives anymore, all right?

08:03.015 --> 08:06.416
But I got your back,
and I'm gonna keep havin' your back.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.419
So before you go
givin' up on this world...

08:08.521 --> 08:12.252
you need to wait till you're about 18
like everybody else, all right?

08:12.358 --> 08:16.556
Mom, if you're so smart, how'd you
end up with Dad in the first place?

08:17.997 --> 08:20.557
Okay, you know what?
You're too smart for your own good.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.827
- I'll see you at the tip-off.
- All right, Mom.

08:25.571 --> 08:29.166
Because if I hadn't, I-
I wouldn't have had you.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.005
Keith?

08:32.111 --> 08:35.011
I wouldn't have had you.

08:35.114 --> 08:38.948
I always think of the good mom stuff
after he's gone. Crazy.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.204
<i>It's game day</i>
<i>here at Mount Vernon. </i>

09:02.308 --> 09:04.868
Let's take a moment to review
the Smelters' starting lineup.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.468
<i>First off,</i>
<i>we have Keith Ellis. </i>

09:07.580 --> 09:10.515
<i>Now, everyone knows Keith Ellis is</i>
<i>the best player on the team, including Keith. </i>

09:10.616 --> 09:12.948
<i>At power forward is One Love. </i>

09:13.052 --> 09:16.453
<i>Okay, now, the only thing One Love</i>
<i>loves more than playing basketball... </i>

09:16.556 --> 09:18.456
<i>is his shoes, um... </i>

09:18.558 --> 09:20.958
<i>his hair, his image,</i>
<i>and his shoes again. </i>

09:21.060 --> 09:23.085
<i>At point guard,</i>
<i>we've got Ralph. </i>

09:23.196 --> 09:25.096
<i>The kid has got</i>
<i>four older brothers, okay?</i>

09:25.197 --> 09:27.097
<i>All of them</i>
<i>were all-star athletes. </i>

09:27.200 --> 09:30.533
<i>I mean, the pressure</i>
<i>to succeed is tremendous. </i>

09:30.636 --> 09:33.696
<i>Returning as small forward</i>
<i>is the player with the best attitude... </i>

09:33.806 --> 09:35.706
<i>and the worst vision. </i>

09:35.808 --> 09:39.972
<i>Last year, he held the record</i>
<i>for the most balls to the face. </i>

09:40.079 --> 09:43.742
<i>- Luckily, this year, he has a solution. </i>
<i>- And a new nickname, Annie. </i>

09:43.849 --> 09:45.749
<i>Everyone's</i>
<i>callin' the kid Goggles. </i>

09:45.851 --> 09:48.217
<i>Rounding out</i>
<i>the starting five is Fuzzy. </i>

09:48.321 --> 09:50.551
<i>Now, we have</i>
<i>high expectations for the kid. </i>

09:50.656 --> 09:54.319
<i>I mean, word on the street</i>
<i>is that he's been bulking up... </i>

09:54.427 --> 09:57.191
<i>specifically</i>
<i>for this season. </i>

09:59.498 --> 10:03.901
<i>And, of course, the coach of</i>
<i>our intrepid team and home ec teacher... </i>

10:04.003 --> 10:05.903
<i>Mr. Newirth. </i>

10:06.005 --> 10:09.270
<i>While he's never coached before</i>
<i>or even played the game of basketball... </i>

10:09.375 --> 10:13.072
<i>he proved to the administration he was</i>
<i>exactly what they were looking for. </i>

10:13.179 --> 10:15.147
Oh, yeah? How?

10:15.248 --> 10:17.978
- He volunteered for the job.
- Okay.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.177
Get a shoe contract yet,
One Love?

10:20.286 --> 10:22.982
- Not yet.
- Bam!

10:25.658 --> 10:27.558
Your deal.

10:27.660 --> 10:30.686
Court's free.
You little guys wanna warm up?

10:30.796 --> 10:32.457
What for?

10:32.565 --> 10:34.863
<i>Want a cookie?</i>

10:34.967 --> 10:37.458
- You spit on this?
<i>- No. </i>

10:37.570 --> 10:41.404
- All right.
<i>- Game nine, and the pressure is on. </i>

10:41.507 --> 10:44.533
But you couldn't tell by looking at the calm,
confident faces of the Smelters...

10:44.644 --> 10:46.976
<i>easily the best 0-8 team</i>
<i>in the league... </i>

10:47.079 --> 10:49.707
hungry to avenge
their nail-biting loss last week.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.010
86 to zero.

10:52.118 --> 10:57.112
In which the Smelters were subjected
to several hundred bad calls.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.626
Break!

11:35.594 --> 11:37.619
Okay.

11:42.568 --> 11:45.264
<i>One Love's cutting! One Love's open!</i>

11:45.371 --> 11:47.703
<i>One Love is open!</i>

11:47.807 --> 11:50.833
One Love has the ball!

11:54.980 --> 11:59.007
<i>Here! Pass it!</i>
<i>Right here, Keith! Right here!</i>

11:59.118 --> 12:02.281
Keith!

12:07.793 --> 12:09.727
<i>- Man, what's he doing?</i>
<i>- I don't know. </i>

12:26.812 --> 12:31.044
<i>Man, if we had Coach Roy, we'd never lose. </i>

12:36.355 --> 12:39.017
- Touchdown!
- Oh, here's the-

12:41.460 --> 12:43.052
Ow!

12:43.162 --> 12:45.062
All right, our next guest...

12:45.164 --> 12:48.099
is looking to get back
into the game he loves, and this time...

12:48.200 --> 12:50.100
he promises not to ruffle
any more feathers.

12:50.202 --> 12:52.500
<i>- Aw!</i>
- Please welcome the former
head coach at Ohio Polytech...

12:52.605 --> 12:55.699
<i>Roy McCormick!</i>

12:55.808 --> 12:58.333
- Hey!
- How are ya?

12:58.444 --> 13:02.039
Roy, you're a man of your word. You said you'd
come on the show when you were available.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.981
And, brother,
you are really available now.

13:05.084 --> 13:08.110
Well, you know, I'm weighin' my options.
I'm a free agent, baby.

13:08.220 --> 13:11.348
My fans!

13:11.457 --> 13:14.893
<i>Word on the street is you couldn't</i>
<i>get a job right now fielding sheep. </i>

13:14.994 --> 13:17.292
Whoa!

13:17.396 --> 13:21.628
Look, I wanna go somewhere where-
where the desire to win is just great, you know.

13:21.734 --> 13:25.568
'Cause y'all know I'm a winner, and I-
I kind of wanna go back to my roots.

13:25.671 --> 13:28.936
- That's what I want.
- You're a winner!
He's a winner, folks!

13:29.041 --> 13:31.305
- That's right.
- Come with me.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.742
Come on. I got a plan.
Come on.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.232
- Anything yet?
- It's ringing.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.235
- There?
- Mm-hmm.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.703
- I'll get it. Stay.
- Whatever.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.006
<i>Man, this is a junior high. </i>

14:08.113 --> 14:12.140
I won three N.C.B.A. championships.
I mean, what do I gotta do?

14:12.251 --> 14:15.914
Roy, don't you see it?
It's perfect. It's your old school.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.189
Look, we accept their offer.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.192
You work with these kids for a week.
They get a huge thrill out of it.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.524
Duh!
You look like a saint...

14:24.630 --> 14:28.327
<i>and we get free P.R., which,</i>
<i>no offense, Roy, we desperately need. </i>

14:28.434 --> 14:32.495
In the meantime, it'll give me a chance
to land us a solid job offer.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.870
- What offers do we have now?
- Hmm?

14:38.043 --> 14:40.477
Doreen, this is
the supplemental budget.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.479
Could you get me
the full budget, please?

14:42.581 --> 14:44.674
Hon, that is the full budget.

14:51.590 --> 14:55.617
Tim Fink, principal partner,
the Fink Agency. "Fink fast!"

14:55.728 --> 14:59.027
Yeah. Mary Walsh...

14:59.131 --> 15:01.292
<i>principal,</i>
<i>Mount Vernon Junior H-</i>

15:01.400 --> 15:04.096
Whoo! Whoa! Wow!
Okay, it's Coach Roy.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.831
Coach Roy is in the house.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.998
Coach Roy is here. It's my house.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.542
All right. Well, then, gentlemen-
Uh-oh!

15:11.644 --> 15:15.011
Community service?
Did you get arrested for something?

15:15.114 --> 15:18.811
<i>We get more great</i>
<i>sports guys that way. </i>

15:18.918 --> 15:20.909
We're here to accept
your offer.

15:22.321 --> 15:25.654
Yea! No idea
what you're talking about.

15:26.825 --> 15:29.589
Your offer.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.856
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my.

15:31.964 --> 15:35.491
Oh, my goodness.
I-

15:35.601 --> 15:37.660
Just-

15:39.171 --> 15:41.071
S- Spelling error.

15:41.173 --> 15:45.109
So you're telling me
that Roy McCormick...

15:45.210 --> 15:47.770
wants to coach here?

15:50.382 --> 15:52.282
Am I gettin' <i>Punk'd?</i>

15:52.384 --> 15:54.284
Roy's gonna work
with your team.

15:54.386 --> 15:56.411
They're gonna be coached
by the best of the best...

15:56.522 --> 16:00.117
for absolutely-
wait for it- no charge.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.659
<i>Yeah, I wanna give back to the community. </i>

16:02.761 --> 16:06.925
<i>You know, here's where I found</i>
<i>my first true love, which is basketball. </i>

16:07.032 --> 16:10.092
<i>Well, teamwork. </i>
<i>So I guess that's two loves. </i>

16:11.403 --> 16:13.303
- Two loves.
- Mm-hmm.

16:13.405 --> 16:16.203
That was very inspiring, Coach.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.436
Well, uh, gosh, gentlemen.

16:19.545 --> 16:21.513
I guess-

16:22.615 --> 16:24.583
Follow me.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.152
<i>People. Apparently... </i>

16:28.253 --> 16:31.711
some of you have tried
to circumvent school policy...

16:31.824 --> 16:34.486
<i>and hire a new head coach</i>
<i>on your own. </i>

16:34.593 --> 16:37.892
Well, I'm impressed.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.465
<i>Without further ado,</i>
<i>please welcome your new head coach. </i>

16:54.580 --> 16:56.673
Wow.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.478
They're really short.

16:59.585 --> 17:02.247
Yeah, they're 13.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.016
<i>All right, well,</i>
<i>good luck, kids. </i>

17:05.124 --> 17:07.023
And, uh,
behave yourself.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.287
<i>Oh, we will. </i>

17:11.063 --> 17:13.327
I was talking to him.

17:18.270 --> 17:23.037
Coach Roy, I'm a big fan.
I've seen all your commercials.

17:23.142 --> 17:25.166
A couple things
I should warn you about.

17:25.277 --> 17:29.179
<i>Ralph here, for instance,</i>
<i>when he gets nervous, he pukes. </i>

17:29.281 --> 17:32.148
- You my assistant head coach?
- Real honor working with you.

17:32.251 --> 17:36.711
Yeah, I appreciate it. Well, uh, why don't
you run and fetch me a patty melt?

17:36.822 --> 17:40.622
<i>Maybe one with your arms</i>
<i>around the kids having fun?</i>

17:40.726 --> 17:44.127
Yeah, sure thing.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.198
Huh? Got it?
That's right.

17:47.299 --> 17:50.029
<i>Y'all look</i>
<i>basketball style. </i>

17:50.135 --> 17:52.695
- We're never gonna lose again.
- Yeah.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.706
One Love's definitely on the way
to getting a shoe contract now.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.403
- Yeah!
- How you feeling, Ralph?

17:59.511 --> 18:01.809
Oh!

18:03.682 --> 18:05.547
Oh! Priceless.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.676
Y'all run some drills.
All right?

18:07.786 --> 18:10.653
I'm gonna try to get
this guck off my shoe.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.190
Excuse me,
Mr. Photographer.

18:14.726 --> 18:17.058
- We don't know any drills.
- Or have any skills.

18:17.162 --> 18:20.359
We'll just have to make some up then.
Come on.

18:24.203 --> 18:27.070
Okay, great drill.
Let's run our passing drill now.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.504
Come on.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.276
Let's step it up.

18:38.383 --> 18:40.874
<i>I got it. I got it. </i>

18:47.726 --> 18:49.455
Yeah!

18:49.561 --> 18:51.586
- Ooh!
- Aah!

18:55.801 --> 18:58.429
Mary, is it really a good idea?

18:58.537 --> 19:00.767
You know, Jeanie,
you may find this hard to believe...

19:00.873 --> 19:03.740
but I don't get a lot of gifts here
at Mount Vernon.

19:03.842 --> 19:06.936
I got no money. I got no resources.
I got no nothin'.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.070
Excuse me.
That's a double negative.

19:09.181 --> 19:12.947
Bethanne, stick it
where the sun don't not shine.

19:13.051 --> 19:18.648
So, when one of the best coaches in
basketball wants to coach my kids for free...

19:18.757 --> 19:21.590
kids who, incidentally,
are on their way to another no-win season...

19:21.693 --> 19:23.320
<i>I'm not gonna say no. </i>

19:23.428 --> 19:27.797
Besides,
Coach Roy has never...

19:27.900 --> 19:29.959
hit a player.

19:30.068 --> 19:33.162
<i>Oh, okay. Great, great. </i>
<i>So that's the criteria?</i>

19:33.272 --> 19:36.435
If he's never hit a kid, then
he can work at Mount Vernon.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.942
Yeah, I know.
But check it out.

19:39.044 --> 19:41.274
If he steps out of line
in any way...

19:41.380 --> 19:45.282
all we have to do is call the N.C.B.A.,
and he's out of here.

19:45.384 --> 19:48.615
So I think he's gonna be
on his best behavior.

19:48.720 --> 19:53.020
Okay, how are you gonna run a school
and monitor a madman?

19:53.125 --> 19:58.028
Well, Jeanie, I'm not.

19:59.831 --> 20:02.299
Uh-uh! No, no, no, no, no!
I'm not either.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.301
- Uh, uh, uh-
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

20:04.403 --> 20:07.668
You go to all the games anyway.
You could be my eyes and ears.

20:07.773 --> 20:11.675
Yeah. The minute you say
he's out of line, he's gone.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.938
Come on.
Girls, trust me.

20:14.046 --> 20:17.209
Coach Roy is going to do wonders
for this school.

20:17.316 --> 20:20.843
- Coach Roy has some issues-
- Uh!

20:23.188 --> 20:25.156
- that he needs to work-
- Uh!

20:27.226 --> 20:29.854
a little bit...

20:31.897 --> 20:34.457
out.

20:37.336 --> 20:40.828
Stop. Stop. Stop.

20:45.944 --> 20:47.844
Dang!

20:47.946 --> 20:51.211
<i>You really bleed a lot. High blood pressure. </i>

20:51.316 --> 20:54.843
- Too much stress.
- What's that? CK-One?

20:54.953 --> 20:57.922
<i>- How much do they pay you</i>
<i>to put that on your hankie?</i>
- Let me smell it.

20:58.023 --> 21:00.617
Look, I don't care
how many titles he's won.

21:00.726 --> 21:03.718
I don't care anything about that.
I know his reputation.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.854
- Come on. Give him a chance.
- For what?

21:05.964 --> 21:09.092
He's got some problems,
and if he touches my son-

21:12.838 --> 21:14.601
<i>Stay away from my son!</i>

21:14.706 --> 21:17.004
<i>Mom, he didn't hit anybody. </i>

21:17.109 --> 21:20.670
Yet. He just got here.
Give him a chance.

21:20.779 --> 21:22.974
<i>We hit him</i>
<i>and barfed on him. </i>

21:23.081 --> 21:25.072
Plus, his Escalade
got tagged.

21:25.183 --> 21:28.050
But he doesn't know that yet.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.254
Look, I'm sorry.

21:31.356 --> 21:35.622
My name is Jeanie,
and it's just my son means a lot to me.

21:35.727 --> 21:40.357
Look, uh- Excuse me.
Miss Jeanie?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.763
Now, look, I know
my reputation precedes me.

21:42.868 --> 21:46.099
But it's just rep, you know?
It's not true.

21:46.204 --> 21:49.571
Roy McCormick.
Very nice to meet you.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.735
I know who you are.
My son idolizes you.

21:52.844 --> 21:56.245
Well, your son,
he's-he's a good kid.

21:56.348 --> 21:58.873
I think he's gonna do
big things in this game.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.748
- He's gonna be all right.
- Well, that's good to know,
because <i>that's</i> not my son.

22:01.853 --> 22:04.549
<i>That's</i> my son.

22:06.792 --> 22:10.489
He's gonna be good too,
'cause they-they run drills together, so-

22:10.595 --> 22:12.495
They kind of know
the same drills.

22:12.597 --> 22:15.031
And, quite frankly, I don't like
the way you treat your players.

22:15.133 --> 22:17.966
My son doesn't need
some hotshot egomaniac...

22:18.070 --> 22:20.595
trying to tell him he's good,
because he <i>is</i> good.

22:20.706 --> 22:23.368
Ma'am-
Miss Jeanie, look, I swear...

22:23.475 --> 22:25.773
the only reason I'm here
is-is to help these kids.

22:25.877 --> 22:30.644
I wouldn't do anything to hurt 'em. Now,
that temper tantrum thing is long gone.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.808
Well, it was nice meeting you.

22:32.918 --> 22:35.182
Very nice meetin' you.

22:35.287 --> 22:40.247
If you don't mind, maybe I can call you
sometime or somethin'?

22:40.359 --> 22:42.520
I don't think so.

22:45.897 --> 22:47.990
Dude, Roy's checking out
your mom.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.159
He ain't lyin'.

22:53.605 --> 22:58.042
<i>Coach Roy, what's it like coming back</i>
<i>to coach at your old school?</i>

22:58.143 --> 23:00.941
It's a'ight, you know,
and, you know-

23:01.046 --> 23:03.344
<i>I grew up in the mean streets-</i>
<i>the suburbs. </i>

23:03.448 --> 23:07.384
Okay? I had one dream,
and that was to get out...

23:07.486 --> 23:10.614
not end up here
like these losers...

23:10.722 --> 23:15.318
who, I guess,
I would love to give back to.

23:15.427 --> 23:20.490
<i>For such a great coach,</i>
<i>he really doesn't do much, does he?</i>

23:20.599 --> 23:22.499
No.

23:44.489 --> 23:48.391
- There's a game today?
- That's why we're in uniform.

23:48.493 --> 23:50.518
Oh, how the mighty
have fallen.

23:50.629 --> 23:53.029
<i>You don't remember me,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

23:53.131 --> 23:55.224
<i>I applied to be your assistant coach</i>
<i>seven times. </i>

23:55.333 --> 23:58.325
You said that
I was too rigid.

23:58.437 --> 24:02.999
Turns out I wasn't so rigid, I couldn't lead
the Vikings to nine state championships.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.566
Wow. I didn't know middle schools
had state championships.

24:06.678 --> 24:09.772
Well, they do,
and I won them nine times.

24:09.881 --> 24:14.079
Nine times?
Big kudos for ya.

24:16.188 --> 24:20.784
F.Y.I. The only kid you need to look out for
on my team is my son, Larry Jr.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.553
All right, well,
good luck, man.

24:25.664 --> 24:28.132
You're in <i>my</i> house!

24:28.233 --> 24:32.363
This is <i>my</i> world!
You be in <i>my</i> world now!

24:32.471 --> 24:35.565
No mercy.

24:35.674 --> 24:38.234
- One, two, three.
- No mercy!

24:40.846 --> 24:43.212
Let's get some!

24:57.095 --> 25:01.896
Oh! Way downtown!
Yeah!

25:02.000 --> 25:05.163
One Love is cutting!
One Love is open!

25:05.270 --> 25:09.832
One Love has the ball! One Love is shaking!
One Love is baking!

25:09.941 --> 25:11.932
Aah! My shoe!

25:13.678 --> 25:16.943
Aren't you supposed
to be doing something?

25:17.048 --> 25:20.575
Yeah, I'm thinking about what I'm gonna
eat for lunch. You interested?

25:22.554 --> 25:25.921
- Keith, I'm open!
<i>- One Love is wide open!</i>

25:26.024 --> 25:27.787
<i>- Pass the ball!</i>
<i>- Keith, One Love is open!</i>

25:27.893 --> 25:31.761
Has your kid
ever heard of passin'?

25:37.235 --> 25:39.931
We had position, ref!
Where's the call?

25:41.473 --> 25:44.931
Charge!

25:45.043 --> 25:46.670
Oh! Thank you!

25:46.778 --> 25:49.338
Are you kiddin' me?
That was 10 minutes ago.

25:49.447 --> 25:51.938
<i>Oh. </i>

25:52.050 --> 25:54.416
That's our ref-
"Late" Carl Freedburg.

25:54.519 --> 25:56.487
He's a good guy.
He's a little slow on the whistle, though.

25:56.588 --> 25:59.887
- Keith, pass.
<i>- Time out!</i>

25:59.991 --> 26:02.824
Come on, guys. Huddle up.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

26:02.928 --> 26:06.227
Listen, I don't mind you
embarrassin' yourselves...

26:06.331 --> 26:08.663
'cause you're used to it,
okay?

26:08.767 --> 26:10.667
But now, you're startin'
to embarrass me.

26:10.769 --> 26:13.363
- What's your name?
- My name's Keith.

26:13.471 --> 26:17.134
Keith, do you think you can, uh,
try not to turn the ball over?

26:17.242 --> 26:19.733
<i>Guys, I need you to get out there</i>
<i>and go to work, okay?</i>

26:19.844 --> 26:23.336
And try to keep it in single digits.
Let's go, guys. Let's go!

26:27.819 --> 26:30.686
We wouldn't wanna humiliate him.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.723
That's a winning attitude.

26:35.627 --> 26:37.822
- Keith, the ball!
- Hey.

26:40.298 --> 26:43.096
What is he doing?

26:49.341 --> 26:53.038
Two! Four! Six! Eight!
Who do we appreciate?

26:53.144 --> 26:55.408
Smelters!

27:00.652 --> 27:03.621
<i>A hockey-playing dog. </i>

27:03.722 --> 27:06.782
What'll those Canadians think of next?
Speaking of animal lovers...

27:06.891 --> 27:08.950
<i>in a follow-up</i>
<i>to a recent story... </i>

27:09.060 --> 27:11.177
former N.C.B.A. madman Coach
Roy McCormick lost his first game today...

27:11.212 --> 27:13.295
former N.C.B.A. madman Coach
Roy McCormick lost his first game today...

27:13.398 --> 27:15.559
in the cutthroat
middle school division!

27:15.667 --> 27:17.362
<i>I swear to God. </i>

27:17.469 --> 27:20.302
<i>109 to nothing. </i>
<i>For real!</i>

27:20.405 --> 27:23.897
<i>He has to teach the kids fundamentals,</i>
<i>things like which basket is ours. </i>

27:26.011 --> 27:28.605
<i> Yeah, like jump ball means</i>
<i>that your team has gotta jump too. </i>

27:28.713 --> 27:31.978
<i>Look, Roy's gotta do a better job if</i>
<i>he wants to coach again in the N.C.B.A.</i>

27:32.083 --> 27:34.415
It's that simple.

27:34.519 --> 27:36.817
Oh, sh- Oh!

27:36.921 --> 27:38.616
Yeah.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.850
Roy? Fink.

27:40.959 --> 27:43.450
Uh, what the heck
are you doin'?

27:43.561 --> 27:47.258
Hey, man, what's the big deal, okay?
It's middle school. Who cares?

27:47.365 --> 27:51.665
Who cares? That's what I said. But,
you know, Roy, it made all the national news.

27:51.770 --> 27:55.399
And I had some solid job offers lined up,
and now everyone's bailed on us.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.943
Look, nobody wants to hire...
a loser.

27:59.044 --> 28:03.606
Look, you gotta win at least one game
with these kids if you ever wanna work again.

28:11.923 --> 28:14.790
Oh, hi.
Are you Mr. McCormick?

28:14.893 --> 28:16.986
I'm a big fan.
Can I please have your autograph?

28:17.095 --> 28:19.962
Sure thing, young lady.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.800
Thank you.

28:27.105 --> 28:30.438
- Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's my car.
- That <i>was</i> your car.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.669
It was part of your endorsement deal,
and that's been terminated.

28:32.777 --> 28:34.870
Have a great day.
I still think you're great.

28:36.681 --> 28:38.876
I want my old life back.

28:40.585 --> 28:42.177
Ooh!

28:47.592 --> 28:49.992
<i>Huddle up!</i>

28:53.331 --> 28:55.231
Now, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

28:55.333 --> 28:59.360
I can't afford to lose by triple digits again,
or else I'm finished.

28:59.471 --> 29:03.669
So I've decided to teach you how
to play the game of basketball.

29:03.775 --> 29:07.211
<i>Yeah, the concept of dribbling,</i>
<i>passing and scoring, okay?</i>

29:07.312 --> 29:11.681
So playtime is over. And if you
don't like it, the door is right there.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.944
Get back here!

29:18.490 --> 29:22.119
I'm gonna need some help.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.855
Unbelievable.

29:24.963 --> 29:26.897
Give me that!

29:26.998 --> 29:29.057
Get off me, boy! You want some too?

29:29.167 --> 29:31.397
Unbelievable!

29:31.503 --> 29:33.733
- What?
- She started it.

29:33.838 --> 29:36.932
- Shut up!
- Go on. You're comin' with me.

29:37.041 --> 29:39.509
- Look who's in trouble again.
- You got somethin' to say?

29:39.611 --> 29:42.978
Look, these ain't even allowed in school.
Okay?

29:43.081 --> 29:45.879
You a natural.
What's your name?

29:45.984 --> 29:47.884
- Big Mac.
- Big Mac.

29:47.986 --> 29:50.113
- You're comin' with me, all right?
- Oh, no. I'm not- No.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.121
I'm not goin' to detention.

29:52.223 --> 29:54.418
It's more like
a work release program.

29:54.526 --> 29:57.256
All right?
Trust me. Suit up.

29:57.362 --> 29:59.660
Come on.
Come on, Big Mac. Suit up.

29:59.764 --> 30:01.732
Trust me.

30:10.008 --> 30:14.707
Whoa.
Yao Ming, wait up.

30:20.051 --> 30:22.542
- What a dork.
- Sorry.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.922
- Hey-
- Excuse me.

30:26.024 --> 30:29.323
- Can I help you?
- I just wanted to talk to one of your players.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.952
"Players"?
These are my students.

30:32.063 --> 30:34.623
And, no, while Wes is in my class,
you can't speak to him.

30:37.702 --> 30:39.602
I'll come back later, okay?

30:39.704 --> 30:43.140
Look.
Wes is really shy, okay?

30:43.241 --> 30:46.802
And he's not into sports, and he really doesn't
need to be pushed around by your type.

30:46.911 --> 30:48.173
- My type?
- Mm-hmm.

30:48.279 --> 30:50.179
What's my type, since you know me?
What's my type?

30:50.281 --> 30:51.805
A bully.

30:51.916 --> 30:56.250
A stubborn, spoiled,
always-gets-his-way bully.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.879
You're good.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.890
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.654
I'll come back after class.

31:03.761 --> 31:09.290
But I do gotta ask somethin'.
Look, son, you like basketball?

31:09.400 --> 31:12.995
Um, I'm not
very coordinated.

31:13.104 --> 31:15.265
Man, that's perfect.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.432
Nobody else on the team
is coordinated.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.306
So join us, please.
It's perfect.

31:20.411 --> 31:22.641
- You- out!
- Just give me one second.

31:22.747 --> 31:25.181
Thirty seconds, all right?
All right?

31:26.484 --> 31:29.180
Son, do you know what
everybody wants out of life?

31:29.287 --> 31:32.450
- No.
- They wanna be loved.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.526
I love you, because...

31:35.627 --> 31:37.561
<i>you are six feet, man... </i>

31:37.662 --> 31:40.392
with extremely long arms,
you know?

31:40.498 --> 31:43.990
<i>Now, I can't promise you if you join the team</i>
<i>that you're gonna get the girls. </i>

31:44.102 --> 31:47.560
I can't- I can help you, you know,
see where they at...

31:47.672 --> 31:49.572
but I can't help you
get the girls, you know.

31:49.674 --> 31:52.302
<i>And I can't even promise</i>
<i>that you're gonna be a good player. </i>

31:52.410 --> 31:55.607
But what I can guarantee you
is that, uh...

31:55.713 --> 31:57.738
you won't be the butt
of nobody's jokes, son.

31:59.784 --> 32:02.150
<i>- How tall are you, son?</i>
- Six-two.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.051
Six-two?

32:05.156 --> 32:08.057
I'm deeper and deeper
in love!

32:08.159 --> 32:11.856
<i>Wow!</i>
<i>Six-two!</i>

32:13.364 --> 32:15.264
Will you join us?

32:16.601 --> 32:18.535
I, uh-

32:19.771 --> 32:22.433
I have to wear a T-shirt
under my jersey...

32:22.540 --> 32:26.408
'cause my perspiration
gives me dermatitis.

32:26.511 --> 32:30.709
Meet me at the gym at 3:00,
'cause, uh, we practice hard.

32:30.815 --> 32:32.442
I'll be there.

32:33.985 --> 32:36.010
My man. All right.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.382
- Careful.
- Yeah. Thanks.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.217
- I'm watchin' you.
- Thank you.

32:44.195 --> 32:46.129
<i>These here are the new recruits. </i>

32:46.230 --> 32:50.758
This is Wes. You mess with him,
you're gonna have to answer to me.

32:50.868 --> 32:54.031
<i>This is Big Mac. </i>

32:54.138 --> 32:57.869
You mess with her,
well, you're on your own.

33:03.081 --> 33:05.140
<i>Are the Smelters running a drill?</i>

33:08.519 --> 33:12.114
Hey, I think that's the girl
that stole my wife's car.

33:13.858 --> 33:16.053
Don't stare.

33:19.864 --> 33:22.332
Just out of curiosity,
how long you been shootin' hoops?

33:22.433 --> 33:24.958
For a while in juvie.

33:25.069 --> 33:27.128
Well, you're our enforcer,
okay?

33:27.238 --> 33:30.002
Don't mean you gotta fight.
But you got five fouls.

33:30.108 --> 33:32.076
Don't be afraid
to use 'em.

33:32.176 --> 33:35.373
- I don't mind fightin'.
- I'm sure.

33:35.480 --> 33:40.281
But you have good hands,
and you have good footwork. Use 'em.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.090
That's not
what I'm talkin' about.

33:49.394 --> 33:51.294
Wes!

33:55.566 --> 33:57.295
Yeah, Coach?

33:57.402 --> 34:02.271
Look, do yourself a favor.
Don't warm up today, all right?

34:02.373 --> 34:05.069
- But I-
- I know. You never, ever played basketball.

34:05.176 --> 34:08.804
But for the next 15 minutes,
that's our little secret, okay?

34:08.913 --> 34:12.507
All right.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.847
<i>My secret weapon. </i>

34:14.952 --> 34:19.821
No weapon form against thee...
shall prosper.

34:19.924 --> 34:21.824
How you doin', my brother?

34:21.926 --> 34:25.554
You always come through
for a brother. Hey!

34:25.663 --> 34:28.393
God bless you!

34:28.498 --> 34:30.330
- Oh, brother!
- Thank you.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.960
You're shinin'.
You're shinin' like the light.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.335
Look, I got about four or five
other engagements I need to get to.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.808
So if we can kind of put a little pep
in the step, get this thing movin'.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.902
Not a problem.
Smelters?

34:43.014 --> 34:46.074
God bless you, basketball babies.
How you doin'?

34:46.184 --> 34:48.982
I'm Preacher Don.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.147
And Coach Roy asked me to come down here
and speak with you.

34:52.255 --> 34:56.716
So if I- if I may, I would like
to say a prayer with you and Coach Roy...

34:56.828 --> 34:58.728
if that's all right.

34:58.830 --> 35:01.731
Let's bow our heads, please.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.767
God is <i>good. </i>

35:05.002 --> 35:06.731
God is great.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.636
<i>Thank you for this game</i>
<i>we're about to receive... </i>

35:09.741 --> 35:11.732
'cause we about
to get up in them.

35:13.778 --> 35:18.875
Thank you for the food that we about to-
No, that's the wrong prayer.

35:20.184 --> 35:22.152
God, we ask that
you give us the strength...

35:22.253 --> 35:25.188
that everything will go our way
out there on the court.

35:25.289 --> 35:28.452
And if that cannot happen, God...

35:28.559 --> 35:32.393
we ask that you injure
some key players on the other team...

35:32.497 --> 35:35.625
<i>not so that they get</i>
<i>seriously injured... </i>

35:35.733 --> 35:37.724
<i>but that they're slowed up... </i>

35:37.835 --> 35:41.032
<i>so that the Smelters</i>
<i>will win this game. </i>

35:41.139 --> 35:43.699
Amen! Amen.

35:43.808 --> 35:47.437
Because we know you- God-
loves a winner.

35:49.747 --> 35:53.877
Can I get an "amen"?

35:53.985 --> 35:56.977
Amen.

35:57.088 --> 35:59.079
I'm gonna need that cash
real quick.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.317
Oh, no problem.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.096
Back off!

36:15.907 --> 36:17.932
In her rookie debut,
Margaret "Big Mac" Green...

36:18.042 --> 36:19.942
won the Smelters'
first tip-off since-

36:20.044 --> 36:23.172
- When's the last time we won a tip? Quick.
- Um- '89.

36:23.281 --> 36:25.772
Two years before
we were born.

36:35.059 --> 36:37.289
- Wait. Uh-
- Where do we write our points?

36:37.395 --> 36:39.625
I don't know.
We've never had to before.

36:44.402 --> 36:46.495
Technical foul,
Mount Vernon!

36:46.604 --> 36:51.132
- What's wrong with you?
- It's a technical foul. Delay of game.

36:51.242 --> 36:54.006
I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to them.

36:55.646 --> 36:58.342
Look, you can't have a parade
every time you score.

36:58.449 --> 37:00.940
<i>Now, get back out there</i>
<i>and get your heads in the game. </i>

37:01.052 --> 37:02.952
Let's go!

37:05.256 --> 37:07.520
Big Mac,
you really tryin' my patience.

37:21.672 --> 37:24.732
Substitution.
Substitution, ref.

37:24.842 --> 37:28.141
I'm bringin' in Sledgehammer.
Sledge?

37:49.000 --> 37:50.900
You're all right.

37:51.002 --> 37:54.233
Ref, let's get an I.D. check here.
This kid looks old enough to drink.

37:54.338 --> 37:56.806
Look, I'm whisperin', okay?
I need you to nod your head...

37:56.907 --> 37:58.841
and act like
I'm sayin' somethin' important.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.241
I need you to go out here,
be cool...

38:01.345 --> 38:03.370
and try not to trip.

38:03.481 --> 38:05.949
Can you do that?

38:06.050 --> 38:08.348
- I-I think so, Coach.
- Thank you, son.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.750
Come on.

38:10.855 --> 38:14.347
<i>Diamond and one. Diamond and one. </i>
<i>Let's go. </i>

38:14.458 --> 38:17.256
<i>- Set it up. </i>
<i>- Okay, double-team the kid. </i>

38:17.361 --> 38:19.090
Double-team the Sledgehammer.

38:22.566 --> 38:25.228
<i>Yeah!</i>

38:37.982 --> 38:39.950
Yeah!

38:42.186 --> 38:44.711
Sledge? Hey?
Give me-

38:44.822 --> 38:46.722
Give me some shake and bake, baby.
A double shake and bake.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.917
You know? With a little bit of this, that.

38:49.026 --> 38:51.153
<i>Double it up. </i>
<i>You know what I'm sayin'? All right?</i>

38:51.262 --> 38:53.730
- Bang with 'em.
- What's that?

38:53.831 --> 38:56.732
<i>Hey, hold your ground, okay? Show 'em</i>
<i>what it's like to be with the big boy. </i>

38:56.834 --> 38:58.631
- Bang with 'em.
- You feel me?

39:01.439 --> 39:04.806
- Huh?
- Stand strong, Wes! Stand strong!

39:11.182 --> 39:15.516
Sledgehammer, huh? Take it
to the iron, boys! They're soft inside!

39:15.619 --> 39:18.144
Wes?

39:18.255 --> 39:21.019
Out.

39:21.125 --> 39:24.959
Hey, you did good, son,
all right?

39:25.062 --> 39:27.724
You hung in there a lot longer
than I thought you would.

39:27.832 --> 39:31.097
Have a seat.
Ralph.

39:32.770 --> 39:35.432
You're in.

39:37.875 --> 39:40.070
Thanks.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.211
<i>Come on! Let's go!</i>

39:45.316 --> 39:47.546
<i>Congratulations. </i>
<i>You only lost by 45.</i>

39:47.651 --> 39:50.142
That's why you're doin'
45 suicides.

39:50.254 --> 39:53.121
<i>Now, let's go. What?</i>
<i>What are you doin' here?</i>

39:53.224 --> 39:56.489
- What?
- Coach, what happens if we win?

39:56.594 --> 39:59.563
Fuzzy, if you win-
<i>if</i> you win-

39:59.663 --> 40:02.962
I'll do a suicide
for every point you win by, okay?

40:03.067 --> 40:06.901
<i>Now, dig it out!</i>
<i>Get back to work. </i>

40:07.004 --> 40:10.132
See the way you're runnin'?
That's why you're losin'.

40:10.241 --> 40:14.507
You may wanna embarrass you,
but you're not gonna embarrass <i>me!</i>

40:18.549 --> 40:21.814
I pulled out
every trick in the book today.

40:21.919 --> 40:24.217
These aren't college kids, Roy.
They're 13.

40:24.321 --> 40:26.653
I mean, you were 13 once, right?

40:26.757 --> 40:30.693
Only one thing motivates
a 13-year-old boy...

40:30.795 --> 40:32.820
<i>and it ain't Smelter pride. </i>

40:42.306 --> 40:45.332
I just said
something smart.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.105
I'm gonna write that down.

40:51.649 --> 40:54.709
Ladies, free pizza here.

40:54.819 --> 40:58.721
Come by the gym, get a slice.
All you want. All you want.

40:58.823 --> 41:00.723
All right?

41:00.825 --> 41:03.259
Cheese, yeah.
Cheese. Excuse me.

41:03.360 --> 41:06.295
- Is he serious?
- Come on!

41:06.397 --> 41:10.128
My mouth's waterin' already.
I can't wait to get to this pizza, y'all.

41:10.234 --> 41:12.794
<i>- Hey, did you get the Cinnabon?</i>
- Whoa.

41:12.903 --> 41:16.566
'Cause they supposed to give us a free
Cinnabon that goes with these pizzas.

41:16.674 --> 41:19.142
Yeah!

41:19.243 --> 41:21.575
Pizza!

41:21.679 --> 41:24.944
Guys, layup lines.

41:25.049 --> 41:27.210
- But-
- Layup lines. Come on.

41:27.318 --> 41:30.583
- All right.
- Is there always gonna be pizza here?

41:30.688 --> 41:32.588
There will be from now on.

41:34.058 --> 41:35.958
- You're home ec, right?
- Yeah.

41:36.060 --> 41:39.029
- How's your pizzas?
- Delicious-y for shizzy.

41:39.130 --> 41:42.293
All right. Okay, good,
'cause that's your new job.

41:42.399 --> 41:44.299
- You straight?
- Yes.

41:44.401 --> 41:47.097
- Oh. I will not let you down.
- All right.

41:47.204 --> 41:50.332
- Okay.
- All right.

41:50.441 --> 41:55.606
There's chicken parm in the crust, ladies,
so put your feed bags on.

41:55.746 --> 41:58.442
Hey, green team out.
Green team out.

41:58.549 --> 42:01.575
<i>- So who are we playin'?</i>
- Me.

42:01.685 --> 42:06.247
You the ball handler, huh? Yeah, that's right.
I see you. You kinda tight with that rock.

42:06.357 --> 42:10.350
You like to go to the basket.
Ain't no "I" in team, huh?

42:10.461 --> 42:13.191
It's about you.
Do your thing, man.

42:13.297 --> 42:15.197
Check it.

42:15.299 --> 42:19.668
- Ooh! Did I anger you?
- Just give me the ball.

42:22.540 --> 42:27.170
Oh! What's the Shaq do? What's
that move he do when he block people?

42:27.278 --> 42:29.178
No, Mutombo.
He do like this.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.180
"I don't think that you should bring it in there.

42:31.282 --> 42:33.614
You should get it
to one of your teammates. "

42:33.717 --> 42:37.983
Let's see what you got, man. You gotta
use your teammates sometime, man.

42:38.088 --> 42:40.613
Huh? Uh-oh.
Look, he's mad now.

42:42.459 --> 42:47.158
<i>Ooh! See, when I get blocked,</i>
<i>I start looking for my teammates. </i>

42:47.264 --> 42:49.960
You know what I mean?
'Cause they can help me out.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.126
You know? Wow!

42:52.236 --> 42:56.536
But if I get the ball to them late,
watch what happens.

43:02.212 --> 43:06.444
I didn't wanna do it.

43:06.550 --> 43:09.883
I'm hungry.

43:11.188 --> 43:13.088
What's wrong with you?
Pass the ball!

43:13.190 --> 43:17.092
<i>Dude, come on. Just pass it. </i>
<i>We'll give it right back. </i>

43:17.194 --> 43:19.219
Come on. Let's go.

43:22.866 --> 43:25.426
Wait a minute. Comin' at ya.

43:25.536 --> 43:27.436
Comin' at-

43:27.538 --> 43:30.268
<i>Comin' at ya. Look. </i>
<i>All right. </i>

43:34.878 --> 43:36.607
<i>- All right. </i>

43:36.714 --> 43:40.582
You passed the ball, man.
How does that feel...

43:40.684 --> 43:43.551
for the ball to go
from your hand to another hand?

43:43.654 --> 43:46.623
Again. Try it again. Let me show you
how you do the one thing.

43:46.724 --> 43:50.091
Uh-huh. Right there.
Right there. Comin' at ya.

43:50.194 --> 43:52.685
Comin' at ya.

43:52.796 --> 43:56.095
Huh? All right.
All right, all right.

43:56.200 --> 43:59.033
All right. All right.
All right.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.434
All right. I'm gonna admit,
I'm a little tired.

44:01.538 --> 44:05.565
<i>The point I'm tryin' to prove is that</i>
<i>teamwork beats out talent any day. </i>

44:05.676 --> 44:09.578
<i>Now, one on one,</i>
<i>neither one of y'all could beat me. </i>

44:09.680 --> 44:12.843
<i>You know, that's just real. </i>
<i>But all five of y'all together... </i>

44:12.950 --> 44:15.475
if y'all play as a team,
you might could do something with me.

44:15.586 --> 44:19.886
<i>And I'm gonna keep it real with you like that. </i>

44:19.990 --> 44:22.584
<i>But anyway, I-</i>

44:22.693 --> 44:24.752
I gotta-
I gotta go throw up.

44:24.862 --> 44:27.228
Green team, you're in!

44:30.534 --> 44:33.002
<i>Let's go, guys. </i>

44:33.103 --> 44:35.298
One Love,
hedge that ball screen.

44:35.406 --> 44:39.172
Right there. There you go.
Right there. A'ight?

44:39.276 --> 44:41.972
- Go to Mac. Mac.
- Here.

44:49.253 --> 44:52.848
All right.
Who can tell me, again...

44:52.956 --> 44:57.154
the highly complex way
of beating the pick-and-roll?

44:58.896 --> 45:00.989
Somebody?

45:01.098 --> 45:02.827
Talking?

45:02.933 --> 45:04.901
Talking.

45:05.002 --> 45:07.562
Exactly. Talking.

45:07.671 --> 45:10.731
Guys, you gotta communicate out there.
You're a team.

45:10.841 --> 45:12.741
All right?
Communication is the key.

45:12.843 --> 45:15.641
It's like a-a healthy
relationship at home.

45:15.746 --> 45:17.714
<i>You know?</i>

45:17.815 --> 45:20.477
You ever flirt around with your lady?
You know, your lady say-

45:20.584 --> 45:22.950
You, like, "Come on. Come on. "
Your lady is, like...

45:23.053 --> 45:25.021
"No, no, not right now.
Remember?

45:25.122 --> 45:28.649
You said that you wanted
to take some time to"-

45:28.759 --> 45:31.159
- Huh?
- You know what?

45:31.261 --> 45:33.195
Run the play again
till you get it right.

45:35.299 --> 45:37.290
Run it!
Come on, guys.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.995
Ladies, I'm not seeing none of those "R!"
You know.

45:40.104 --> 45:43.005
I ain't seein' none of that.
Let's go.

45:43.107 --> 45:46.338
<i>Come on, people. </i>
<i>Guys, communicate out there. </i>

45:46.443 --> 45:48.707
You gotta know each other
like the back of your hand.

45:48.812 --> 45:51.303
<i>Come on! Communicate!</i>

45:51.415 --> 45:53.315
<i>Teamwork!</i>

45:56.520 --> 45:58.715
- Huh?
- What?

45:58.822 --> 46:02.223
I didn't say stop playin'.
Communicate out there.

46:02.326 --> 46:05.159
Okay? Now you have to talk.
Ellis?

46:05.262 --> 46:07.856
<i>- Let's go, guys. Move the ball. </i>
- Come on! Come on!

46:25.449 --> 46:28.077
Ellis.

46:28.185 --> 46:30.653
Shag 'em and bag 'em.

46:40.631 --> 46:42.963
<i>All right,</i>
<i>remember, Ellis. </i>

46:43.066 --> 46:46.035
You invited me here.
This is all your fault. What's up?

46:47.671 --> 46:51.573
- You got a problem, son?
- You always pick on me!

46:51.675 --> 46:55.805
<i>I'm the best player on the team,</i>
<i>and all you ever do is ride me!</i>

46:55.913 --> 46:58.074
Okay, you got me
fair and square.

46:58.182 --> 47:01.151
- I do something wrong, you yell.
- And I wonder why that is.

47:01.251 --> 47:03.981
<i>Even if I do it right,</i>
<i>you yell at me to do it better. </i>

47:04.087 --> 47:08.717
Hey, kid, you-you got a gift.
Okay? You got potential.

47:08.826 --> 47:12.387
You can actually be someone.
You got what it takes, man.

47:12.496 --> 47:15.829
<i>You get your teammates involved,</i>
<i>guess what? You win. </i>

47:15.933 --> 47:18.834
Man, you know what?
You remind me a lot of myself.

47:18.936 --> 47:22.929
The whole showboat,
basketball, and skills.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.840
You and your mama, that's all you got.
Comin' up, that's all I had.

47:26.944 --> 47:28.844
And we didn't live
in the best neighborhood.

47:28.946 --> 47:31.608
It was sort of like
the neighborhood you live in.

47:33.016 --> 47:35.041
I just wanna see you
do good, man.

47:35.152 --> 47:37.313
That's all.

47:43.427 --> 47:46.521
<i>Coach, I got a problem. </i>

47:46.630 --> 47:49.155
If you don't say anything,
they can't make me testify against you.

47:49.266 --> 47:51.894
- I got good lawyers. What?
<i>- No, no, no. </i>

47:52.002 --> 47:54.493
<i>I- I just got this letter</i>
<i>that says I can't play ball. </i>

47:56.240 --> 47:58.435
Won't let you
play basketball? Why?

47:58.542 --> 48:01.272
It says I'm
academically in-eligible.

48:01.378 --> 48:05.439
<i>What's academically</i>
<i>inel-el-legible?</i>

48:05.549 --> 48:08.017
Academically ineligible.

48:08.118 --> 48:11.679
That's what I said.
Academically illegible. I'm illegible.

48:11.788 --> 48:14.780
Well, I'm your coach.
I'm not your guidance counselor, okay?

48:18.495 --> 48:21.487
I can't believe
I'm doin' this.

48:21.598 --> 48:25.466
- What subject did you fail?
- Math.

48:25.569 --> 48:28.970
Uh-oh. Ooh!

48:29.072 --> 48:31.040
<i>Whoa!</i>

48:44.788 --> 48:48.417
- Add this up. Add those up.
- But I don't-

48:48.525 --> 48:50.823
I can't teach
Big Mac math.

48:50.928 --> 48:54.159
- Why not? You scared of her?
- Of course.

48:54.264 --> 48:57.199
Well, so am I, man,
but you got to be brave.

48:57.301 --> 48:59.565
- Take one for the team.
- You?

48:59.670 --> 49:01.535
I didn't think
you were scared of anything.

49:01.638 --> 49:06.041
Hey, courage is just, uh,
well-concealed fear.

49:06.143 --> 49:08.338
That's all.
You got to be brave, man.

49:08.445 --> 49:11.881
You got to stick out your chest,
get mean! Get bad! You know?

49:11.982 --> 49:15.383
Give me the face.
What's the face? What's the face?

49:15.485 --> 49:17.453
Your mean face.

49:17.554 --> 49:19.454
- Huh?
- Grr.

49:19.556 --> 49:21.854
Give me some growls, not "Grr. "

49:32.536 --> 49:34.367
- Holler back.
- Holler back.

49:34.471 --> 49:35.904
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

49:36.006 --> 49:38.054
We gonna work on that.
You got it.

49:38.089 --> 49:40.103
We gonna work on that.
You got it.

49:40.210 --> 49:42.735
<i>Look, I don't think</i>
<i>I can do this, Coach. </i>

49:42.846 --> 49:44.746
Do you wanna be scared
the rest of your life, son?

49:44.848 --> 49:46.816
No.

49:53.757 --> 49:55.987
Big Mac?

49:56.093 --> 49:59.153
I would love
to teach you math.

50:01.098 --> 50:05.125
Aw. See?
She's a sweet, young lady.

50:05.235 --> 50:06.725
Ow!

50:06.837 --> 50:10.034
<i>You tell anyone</i>
<i>I'm studyin'... </i>

50:10.140 --> 50:12.301
and I'll end you!

50:12.409 --> 50:14.604
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

50:22.052 --> 50:26.182
First away game today, Walsh.
Where's the bus driver?

50:27.858 --> 50:30.088
Hello, Roy.

50:30.193 --> 50:32.252
<i>Don't forget to</i>
<i>fill up the tank. </i>

50:33.697 --> 50:35.824
You serious?

50:37.100 --> 50:39.000
No.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.127
Yeah, I'm serious.

50:53.884 --> 50:58.048
<i>S-M-E-L-T-E-R-S!</i>

50:58.155 --> 51:02.319
<i>When it comes to basketball,</i>
<i>we are the best! Say what?</i>

51:02.426 --> 51:05.862
S-M-E-L-T-E-R-S!

51:05.962 --> 51:10.865
When it comes to basketball,
there is no contest! Say what?

51:10.967 --> 51:14.232
<i>S-M-E-L-T-E-R-S!</i>

51:14.337 --> 51:18.330
<i>When it comes to basketball,</i>
<i>there is no contest!</i>

51:18.442 --> 51:22.538
<i>Guys, look like we're gonna</i>
<i>have to forfeit another game. </i>

51:22.646 --> 51:25.638
- Okay? Another loss.
<i>- Lighten up, Coach. </i>

51:25.749 --> 51:27.410
Why you all mad
all the time?

51:27.517 --> 51:31.681
You know, it takes more muscles
to frown than to smile.

51:34.091 --> 51:37.424
Great.

51:37.527 --> 51:41.964
How am I supposed to win a couple
of games when I can't get us there?

51:42.065 --> 51:45.557
Out here with a tire,
and I got a doggone suit on.

51:45.669 --> 51:47.159
<i>- I can't believe this!</i>
- We should help him.

51:47.270 --> 51:49.238
These shoes were 200 bucks.

51:49.339 --> 51:52.035
- I ain't goin' nowhere.
- Then stay in the van then.

51:52.142 --> 51:56.203
Yeah, I'm dressed for the occasion.
I'm dressed to change a tire!

51:56.313 --> 51:59.578
- Well, I'm gonna help him.
- Me too.
- I guess I'll help.

52:01.985 --> 52:05.318
Why me?
What-What have I possibly done?

52:05.422 --> 52:08.255
Huh? Oh, I'm a mentor
to the kids.

52:08.358 --> 52:11.919
- That's right. I don't know
how to change a tire.
- Hey, Coach?

52:12.028 --> 52:14.724
Wanna give us a hand,
or does teamwork only apply to players?

52:22.739 --> 52:27.904
Newirth, lean your head forward
so we can get the weight on the tire.

52:28.011 --> 52:29.706
Yo, come on. Let's get out of here.

52:29.813 --> 52:32.805
Smelters suck!

52:39.856 --> 52:42.984
All right. Okay.
Everybody good?

52:43.093 --> 52:45.391
<i>All right. </i>
<i>Let's go play some basketball. </i>

52:45.495 --> 52:48.589
- All right!
- Let's go. Whoo!

52:52.736 --> 52:55.170
Smelters,
y'all go warm up.

52:55.272 --> 52:58.935
And work on that pick-and-roll. And I don't
wanna see y'all at that Gatorade thing, man...

52:59.042 --> 53:00.976
drinkin' it like it's Kool-Aid.

53:01.077 --> 53:02.942
One Love, let me
holler at you for a second.

53:03.046 --> 53:06.743
<i>Look, I appreciate all the flavor</i>
<i>that One Love's got goin' on. </i>

53:06.850 --> 53:08.681
<i>I understand, man. </i>
<i>It's cool. </i>

53:08.785 --> 53:12.152
But you gotta share the spotlight,
you know?

53:12.255 --> 53:17.488
Most of the nights when Jordan
had-had huge numbers, the Bulls lost.

53:17.594 --> 53:21.997
<i>You so worried about lookin' good, you're gonna</i>
<i>wind up turnin' into a Dennis Rodman. </i>

53:22.098 --> 53:24.532
Dennis Rodman!

53:24.634 --> 53:28.365
I'm not sayin', like,
that's a good thing...

53:28.471 --> 53:31.440
<i>but get out there, work hard, man,</i>
<i>and get them rebounds. </i>

53:31.541 --> 53:34.442
You'll feel good about that,
and you'll feel good about the game.

53:36.079 --> 53:39.879
So what you're saying is that...
I'm not really good.

53:39.983 --> 53:44.352
No, man. I'm not sayin' that.
I'm sayin' the opposite of that.

53:44.454 --> 53:48.948
I'm sayin' you're so good,
I wanna give you these.

53:49.059 --> 53:53.325
<i>Yeah, these are my most prized possession. </i>
<i>Magic Johnson gave me these. </i>

53:53.430 --> 53:57.230
<i>Hey, man, I won every game</i>
<i>I wore 'em in. </i>

53:57.334 --> 53:59.632
I-

53:59.736 --> 54:03.194
Just don't tell nobody.

54:03.306 --> 54:08.403
<i>You know, folks, they get a little envious</i>
<i>when your jump shot's like that. </i>

54:08.511 --> 54:10.979
I promise.

54:17.087 --> 54:21.990
<i>Well, well. If it isn't</i>
<i>Fox Sports' turkey of the week. </i>

54:22.092 --> 54:24.083
You're lookin' good, Roy.

54:24.194 --> 54:27.561
Larry and I are here
scoutin' the Pioneers.

54:27.664 --> 54:31.566
They're our only real
competition in this league.

54:31.668 --> 54:34.262
<i>Wait. Is that a girl</i>
<i>on your team?</i>

54:34.371 --> 54:36.498
<i>Girls can't play</i>
<i>basketball. </i>

54:36.606 --> 54:38.437
What did you-

54:38.541 --> 54:41.669
- Somebody get the ice.
- What for?

54:48.718 --> 54:51.778
Look, I know you don't like
to back down from a fight...

54:51.888 --> 54:56.222
but real power is about bein' respected,
not just crackin' heads.

54:56.326 --> 54:58.351
Think about it.

55:04.367 --> 55:06.528
<i>- All right. </i>
- Hey.

55:06.636 --> 55:10.072
Let's go. Let's go.
Do your thing. Hey.

55:10.173 --> 55:14.542
Hey. I heard what you said to Keith.
I was wrong about you.

55:14.644 --> 55:17.340
- And I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

55:17.447 --> 55:19.415
Sorry and
"Let's go out on a date" sorry?

55:19.516 --> 55:22.576
'Cause I don't give out
pity dates.

55:22.686 --> 55:26.281
But times have changed,
and I can make an exception.

55:26.389 --> 55:29.790
Wow. You know,
you got a pretty smile.

55:31.528 --> 55:33.689
Look, I'm gonna take
the Smelts out to get a Slurpee.

55:33.797 --> 55:37.289
Okay? I'm gonna have 'em home by 8:00.
Can I call you?

55:37.400 --> 55:40.767
Pump your brakes
and watch your temper...

55:40.870 --> 55:43.395
'cause I'm still
watching you, Roy.

55:43.506 --> 55:46.634
And I'm still
watchin' you.

56:00.390 --> 56:03.791
The Smelters apparently abandoning
their usual strategy...

56:03.893 --> 56:07.124
of getting scored on, and instead
choosing to score themselves.

56:07.230 --> 56:10.461
<i>Yes. Coach Roy clearly</i>
<i>shaking things up... </i>

56:10.567 --> 56:13.866
using his new
ingenious scoring offense.

56:13.970 --> 56:17.098
- Good word.
- Thanks.

56:17.207 --> 56:19.175
Let's go, guys.
Hands up, all right?

56:19.275 --> 56:22.039
Hands up. Hands up, guys.
Let's go!

56:22.145 --> 56:25.239
<i>Come on. I want hands up. </i>
<i>Hands up! Let's go, guys!</i>

56:25.348 --> 56:27.782
<i>Hands up!</i>

56:27.884 --> 56:31.183
Time out. Time out, guys.

56:35.925 --> 56:39.156
You know what?
Guys, keep your hands up out-

56:39.262 --> 56:42.459
You know what? Hands up.
Everybody, hands up.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.499
Okay? Yeah.

56:44.601 --> 56:47.035
A little of that.

56:47.137 --> 56:51.699
- Okay.
- Oh, sweet mother, that's hot! Oh! Oh!

56:51.808 --> 56:54.299
Oh, y'all think it's funny?
Y'all think it's funny?

56:54.411 --> 56:57.642
Give some to you, and you.
Little right there.

56:57.747 --> 57:00.978
Huh? Now, get out there
and play some basketball!

57:01.084 --> 57:03.644
Hands up.

57:07.791 --> 57:12.490
<i> All right, guys. </i>
<i>Think now. Use your head! Hands up!</i>

57:12.595 --> 57:17.089
<i>That's what defense is about-</i>
<i>blocked shots, baby. Now attack that board!</i>

57:18.201 --> 57:20.931
<i>That's how you play defense. </i>
<i>Attack. </i>

57:21.037 --> 57:23.505
All right. All right.
Now, move the ball.

57:23.606 --> 57:26.666
Yeah! Push it, Keith!
Push it! Yeah!

57:26.776 --> 57:29.438
Right there! Good job!

57:29.546 --> 57:31.537
Love it. Yes!

57:36.085 --> 57:37.985
Keith, pass it!

57:39.622 --> 57:41.749
<i>- Time out. </i>

57:41.858 --> 57:43.883
Time out. Time out.

57:43.993 --> 57:46.291
What did we do now?

57:47.363 --> 57:49.388
You're playing basketball, baby.

57:49.499 --> 57:51.626
Yeah!

57:51.734 --> 57:55.033
Listen. "Smelters" on three,
all right? Let's do this.

57:55.138 --> 57:57.663
One, two, three. Smelters!

57:57.774 --> 58:00.208
Let's go. Yes.

58:01.444 --> 58:05.039
You're playing basketball, baby.
Yeah.

58:05.148 --> 58:06.979
Twelve, twelve.
Zone. Hands up.

58:07.083 --> 58:10.780
<i> Fifteen seconds left. </i>
<i>Smelters are only down by one. </i>

58:10.887 --> 58:13.720
<i>- Wes steals the ball. </i>
<i>- Shoot it! Shoot it!</i>

58:13.823 --> 58:15.916
<i>There's 10 seconds left. </i>

58:16.025 --> 58:20.826
<i>Shoot it, Wes! Shoot it!</i>

58:27.604 --> 58:29.572
Yes!

58:41.718 --> 58:45.119
- Okay, that's just wrong. Sit down, now.
- Sorry.

59:06.309 --> 59:09.210
What? What in God's name
just happened?

59:09.312 --> 59:12.975
All right, guys.
The van's leaving in two minutes, all right?

59:13.082 --> 59:15.949
Um, Coach?
You forgettin' something?

59:16.052 --> 59:19.283
<i>Coach, we won. </i>

59:19.389 --> 59:21.357
Ah, y'all
stop messing around, okay?

59:21.457 --> 59:24.290
Look, I want to beat rush hour,
so let's get goin', okay?

59:24.394 --> 59:26.021
- Uh-uh.
- Come on, Coach.

59:26.129 --> 59:30.259
But my asthma is-You unders-

59:30.366 --> 59:33.494
I don't have the-

59:33.603 --> 59:36.197
Coach Roy! Coach Roy! Coach Roy!

59:36.306 --> 59:38.740
Coach! Coach! Coach!

59:38.841 --> 59:41.401
All right, y'all got me good.
All right.

59:44.581 --> 59:47.914
<i>Coach Roy! Coach Roy!</i>
<i>Coach Roy! Coach Roy!</i>

01:00:40.436 --> 01:00:43.269
Ooh.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:51.103
I was thinking you all
might like-

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.079
What the-

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:56.811
- Yeah! Our new uniforms!
- These are tight!

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:59.649
23! 32!

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:16.071
- You like it?
- I love it.

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:22.176
<i>No, no. Please, no. Not the face!</i>

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:24.178
<i>Ow! Aah!</i>

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:39.760
Let's sit down.

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:42.695
Here.

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:47.125
- My highest grade ever.
- "C"- plus.

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:49.170
So, can I keep
the skateboard?

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.331
- No, it's mine.
- Oh.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.113
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.838
S-M-E-L-T-E-R-S!

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:30.345
<i>When it comes to basketball,</i>
<i>we are the best! Say what?</i>

01:02:30.446 --> 01:02:33.882
<i>S-M-E-L-T-E-R-S!</i>

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:38.249
<i>When it comes to basketball,</i>
<i>there is no contest!</i>

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.489
<i>Come on, guys! Come on!</i>

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.994
Yo! Don't make me
get the Icy Hot!

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.931
All right,
how's their forward shootin'?

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:53.763
He's throwin' nothing but bricks.
Twenty percent last game from beyond the arc.

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:57.203
All they have to do
is keep the kid out of the paint.

01:02:57.306 --> 01:03:01.106
<i> Twenty-five seconds left</i>
<i>in the Smelters' first-ever play-off game. </i>

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:03.770
<i>Keith passes to One Love. </i>
<i>One Love shoots. He scores!</i>

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:09.841
- Traveling! Basket doesn't count!
- Are you insane?

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:12.614
<i>How bad a ref do you have to be</i>
<i>to call middle school?</i>

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:15.885
<i>What? Was junior varsity</i>
<i>too demanding for you?</i>

01:03:15.992 --> 01:03:17.584
- Roy!
- Huh?

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:22.596
555-97-

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:25.929
It's my phone number!
Write it down!

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:27.366
Oh!

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:30.439
Oh, it's her number.
Um, go ahead.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.565
- Uh, go.
<i>- 555-</i>

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:34.267
- 555-
<i>- 97-</i>

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:35.935
- 97-
- 41.

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:37.910
41. Okay.

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:40.448
Go!

01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:49.714
Hey, hey!
Oh! Yeah!

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:54.592
We're going
to the finals, baby!

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:57.631
Yeah!

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:14.614
These were Magic Johnson's.

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:17.117
Have you seen the vertical
One Love gets in these?

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:22.153
Go talk to him.

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:31.198
Hi.

01:04:35.438 --> 01:04:38.271
Hi.

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:43.141
He's shy. I'm Goggles.
I'm the sixth man.

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:45.476
Means I like to
ride the pine.

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:49.111
Who's your friend?

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:54.218
<i>Big Wes. </i>

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:58.191
- Yeah, Coach?
- Man, you can't run from the ladies forever.

01:04:58.294 --> 01:05:00.353
No, it's not that.

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.294
It's just...

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:05.060
I kind of have a girlfriend.

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:08.466
Hey, this is me, man.
This is the coach.

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.996
Trust me.
He has a girlfriend.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:15.168
- How would you know?
- I've seen her.

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:18.714
If you talk to that girl again,
you're gonna need a new face.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:22.384
Okay.

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:50.211
Now, if my teacher
looked like you...

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:54.079
I would have the vocabulary
to pay you a decent compliment.

01:05:54.183 --> 01:06:00.122
So I'm just gonna say,
"Mm, mm, mm, mm. "

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.452
No, I ain't finished.

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:06.961
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
Just one more. Mm.

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:08.963
Mm!

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:10.965
So, I just thought
I'd tell you that.

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:14.867
That'll do.
And thank you for dressing up.

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:20.033
Well, you know, my Prada had puke
on it, and ice cream. The kids.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.633
Relax, Roy.
You look very nice.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:27.045
Thank you. Um, you know,
it's just been a long week.

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:29.208
Why don't you come in?

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:36.019
Keith! Keith!
Save some for tomorrow, baby. Come on.

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:39.288
- I need you guys to clear this up. It's getting late.
- Later.

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:42.796
I'm just waitin' to see him pass it back.

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.798
Don't step on my flowers.

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:47.095
- Thank you, baby.
- Your mama did her thing.

01:06:47.203 --> 01:06:49.103
Yeah, yeah.
It's all right.

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:50.934
- Thank you.
- Good night, Coach.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:56.171
When you first came here,
I had a real bad first impression of you.

01:06:56.278 --> 01:06:58.746
But you was dead wrong,
right?

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.978
No. I was dead right.
I mean, you were a spoiled pretty boy...

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:05.246
who was handed
everything he ever wanted.

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.982
You didn't give a damn
about coachin', only your suits.

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:12.584
All I'm saying is,
look at you now.

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:16.461
Look, this personal attack
on my- on my personality-

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:21.502
Is it leading up to a kiss or a slap?
'Cause I can't tell yet.

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:26.269
We'll see.
I haven't decided yet.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:29.469
Yeah.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.618
Coach.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.620
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:43.624
What you doin' here? You going to the game?
Fuzzy's been on fire.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:46.524
Oh. Good for Fuzzy.
What's a Fuzzy? It doesn't matter.

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:50.861
Do you check your messages? The N.C.B.A. review,
it's today. They want to reinstate you.

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:53.594
Today the kids
got the championship.

01:07:53.703 --> 01:07:57.400
I know that. I worked it out.
The N.C.B.A. review's not scheduled till 4:00.

01:07:57.506 --> 01:08:00.168
The game's at 5:00. You can make both.
But we gotta move now.

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:02.744
- Seriously?
- Seriously. Let me get that.

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:06.303
Come on. Oh, this is lovely.
This must look great on you.

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:15.556
V-I-K-I-N-G-S!

01:08:15.658 --> 01:08:19.287
It's about the kids.
I try to instill a good work ethic...

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.886
but a lot of the parents
get a little too wrapped up.

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:25.763
I'm not gonna pretend that
doesn't peeve me off. It's about the kids.

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.837
What are we doin'?
What are we standing around for?

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.372
Let's go!
I want some drills!

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:34.203
Come on!
I'm talking to you!

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:42.411
Man, stop the car.

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:44.645
- What time is it?
- Ten to 4:00. You're good.

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:47.450
Don't worry about it.
Go in there and knock 'em dead.

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:01.832
What has two thumbs
and makes a lot of money? Huh?

01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:03.837
This guy.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:08.103
If your beverage gets warm,
I could cool it off with a little ice. Huh?

01:09:11.412 --> 01:09:13.573
Excuse me.

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:19.410
Coach Roy's phone.

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:24.288
- Roy?
- This is his representative, Tim Fink.
Roy's in a meeting.

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:27.385
A meeting? But he has
a championship game today.

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:31.761
Right. With the, uh, Smugglers.
Yeah. Well, he's in the N.C.B.A. review.

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:34.995
Well, can you get him <i>out</i> of the meeting
with the N.C.B.A?

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:37.299
Uh, okay.
Just hang on one sec.

01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:40.466
I'm not gonna do that. He's got
his career to think about. And mine.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:44.671
This is way more important than some kids
playing with Fuzzies and Goggles.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:48.613
Well, can you tell him that he's
a huge disappointment to me...

01:09:48.716 --> 01:09:50.617
to my son, the Fuzzies,
the Goggles...

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:53.779
and everybody else
who thought he actually cared?

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:57.916
Huge disappointment...
you and son.

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:00.427
Got it. And, uh,
your name is, sweetheart?

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:04.363
You want my name?
Listen real close.

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:14.675
<i>Sit down. Sit down, Roy. </i>
<i>Sorry to keep you waiting. </i>

01:10:14.777 --> 01:10:19.805
I just want to be the first to say
about the whole banning thing- My bad.

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:23.544
Those kids of yours are getting
more press than Polytech itself.

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:28.214
Hey, well, you know, I'm just glad
we could put a few wins under our belts.

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.349
It just feels nice to
give back to the community.

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:35.487
Yeah, right. Uh, you got your job back, Roy.
You can drop the P.R. routine.

01:10:35.598 --> 01:10:40.058
<i>That was brilliant the way you</i>
<i>used those kids. Nice going. </i>

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:44.333
You just have to sign here, Coach,
and you get your old life back.

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:57.709
You know, these kids, man...

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.811
they really
taught me a lot.

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:04.222
<i>And they've made me a better coach. </i>
<i>Better than I ever was. </i>

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:06.658
Uh, uh, I think I see
where this is going.

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:09.890
<i>I swear to you, Roy,</i>
<i>we're giving you everything you want. </i>

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:13.366
Nah, nah. I don't-
I don't think you know what I mean.

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:15.403
Listen. Look,
thanks for the offer, man...

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:18.598
but I already got a team.

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:21.540
I'm the coach, man,
of the Mount Vernon Smelters.

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.204
And I'm proud of that.
Okay?

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.178
Are you out of your mind?

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:29.251
No. I'm not out of my mind.

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:34.653
I found a group of kids that love the game
of basketball the way I loved basketball.

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:37.749
You know?
So damn the fame, man.

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.920
You know, I don't care nothin'
about the year's supply of deodorant.

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.396
I just want to have fun
and teach these kids, man.

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:47.526
So, thank you very much.
I have a team to go coach.

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:51.595
We're in the finals,
and you're making me late.

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:56.436
Wish me luck, will you?

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.774
Roy! How'd we do?

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:05.286
It's rush hour. You're never gonna make it
across town. Okay. Let me get my stuff.

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:18.329
- You got to get back on "D."
- What? You don't tell me what to do.

01:12:18.434 --> 01:12:21.403
You are not our coach!

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:24.963
We don't have one.

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:37.613
Yes!

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:46.656
Oh.

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:49.356
Blocking foul.
Smelter.

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:57.503
"Late" Carl once again making
a disappointing call against the Smelters.

01:12:57.606 --> 01:13:00.837
You gotta wonder if the league brass
pressured him to keep this game close.

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:08.316
- Oh, my God, he's here.
- Coach Roy!

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.385
I thought you
got your team back.

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:13.353
This <i>is</i> my team, baby.

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:18.551
Whoa! Whoa!

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.685
Yeah!

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.696
I was so right about you.

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:25.232
I mean, before, when I told you
you were an egomaniac.

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:27.962
'Cause no, not last night.
Last night I was wrong.

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:31.638
Oh.

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:36.575
But you came back.
Okay, never mind the message. Bye.

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:38.578
Yes!

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.911
Hey, Carl.
Delay of game. Let's go!

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.508
Time out!

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.918
All right. Listen up.
This is important.

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:50.890
- Ralph, how many quarters did you play?
- Two.

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:54.394
- How many times did you puke?
- None.

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:56.555
You're a regular Michael Jordan.

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:59.225
Big Mac.

01:13:59.334 --> 01:14:02.770
I'm proud of you. Congratulations.
Passing math. Give her a round of applause.

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:05.533
Yeah.

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:09.668
You even got Keith passin'. He's actually
coming out on the court and passin' the ball.

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:13.236
You. Big Wes.

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:16.784
Yes. The ladies' man!

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:22.221
Uh, hey, keep doin' your thing.
Big center, right?

01:14:22.324 --> 01:14:25.384
Fuzzy. Man,
that defense thing you doin'?

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:27.587
I'm loving that.
That's what wins games.

01:14:27.696 --> 01:14:29.926
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:34.366
<i>And look, guys, no matter what</i>
<i>the scoreboard says, you are all winners. </i>

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.404
<i>Have fun, all right?</i>

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:39.531
<i>I love this game,</i>
<i>and I know you do. </i>

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:42.576
So go out here and crush them,
and have fun doin' it.

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:45.203
<i>"Smelters" on three. </i>

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:48.044
- Yeah!
- Let's do this!

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:51.381
One, two, three!
Smelters!

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:52.936
Yeah!

01:14:52.971 --> 01:14:54.385
Yeah!

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.227
Hey, hey, hey.

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:31.050
Yes!

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:45.933
<i>The team is in the zone. </i>

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.669
They have blown their old
per-game averages out of the water.

01:15:48.777 --> 01:15:50.677
- Even Ralph scored?
- No.

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:54.010
But he's keeping his hands up.
Go, Ralph!

01:15:54.116 --> 01:15:56.243
- Go. Way to go.
- Go, Ralph!

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:05.322
Jump in his 12:00!

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:08.494
Jump in his 12:00!

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.365
Hey, hey, hey.
Earth to Carl.

01:16:14.469 --> 01:16:17.802
<i>Earth to Carl. </i>
<i>You gonna call that?</i>

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:26.407
Offensive charge.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:29.507
Oh! You've
got to be kidding me!

01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:39.058
Just wanna say
you doing a real good job.

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:45.100
Yeah, I know.
But it's still nice to hear it once in a while.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.930
I just read this book saying you should
give yourself pats on the back.

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:51.267
Daddy never gave me
those pats I needed. He never-

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:53.773
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:58.369
This guy's as blind as my dead grandma,
twice as slow!

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.778
Why don't you just relax?
It's just a game.

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:04.113
Oh, yeah. It's just a game?
This is the state championships!

01:17:04.219 --> 01:17:07.416
Slap him with a "T," idiot,
or go back to Foot Locker.

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:11.891
I got a technical. Smelters shoot two.

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:13.894
I'm doing good.

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:15.759
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:17:15.864 --> 01:17:18.697
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes!

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:27.201
Two shots.

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:43.384
One shot.

01:17:57.372 --> 01:18:00.341
Time out.

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.774
Come here.

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:06.609
All right.
Here we go, guys. Listen.

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:09.115
<i>Communicate out there, okay?</i>

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:11.913
Work together as a team.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.682
The other thing I want to say was,
next year...

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:20.353
- I'll be back to take you all
to the championships.

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:24.262
That's right. Now, "Smelters" on three.
Stop playin'.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:27.802
One, two, three. Smelters!

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:30.030
Keith, you're the captain.

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:32.072
I know, I know.
Pass it, pass it.

01:18:32.174 --> 01:18:34.074
No, I wasn't gonna say that.

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:37.145
I want you to trust yourself.
That's what I was gonna say.

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:40.078
Trust yourself.
Do your thing.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:54.628
Yes! Ooh!

01:19:07.843 --> 01:19:10.311
No!

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:28.191
- Foul! Smelters shoot two.
- Yeah.

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:30.491
Yes! Yes!

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:31.827
Yes.

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:37.697
Hey, hey. You can't-

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:40.240
You can't blow the whistle
when the game is over!

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:43.243
But I just did do that!

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:47.406
No one tells me what to do. I'm an
authority figure. You better step back there.

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:51.649
<i>Two shots. </i>

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.002
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:20:10.105 --> 01:20:12.437
Oh, hell.

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:17.803
Whoo!

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:22.710
One shot.

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:39.794
Yeah! Whoo!

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:46.807
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:54.781
Yeah! Number one, baby!

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:57.113
<i>Roy!</i>

01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:01.148
Hey, listen, um...

01:21:01.256 --> 01:21:04.919
there's a message on your machine
that I want to talk about.

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:09.395
- What did it say?
- Well, basically, in my own words...

01:21:09.498 --> 01:21:12.399
- Yeah.
- this.

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.801
Oh, wow.

01:21:17.305 --> 01:21:19.170
You know what you said about me?

01:21:19.274 --> 01:21:23.608
- Mm-hmm.
- You were right. You were dead on.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.612
What can I say?
I'm a teacher.

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.614
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
