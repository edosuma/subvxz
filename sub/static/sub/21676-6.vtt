09:49.999 --> 09:50.999
Like, I think
he's funny,

09:50.999 --> 09:52.999
I think he's cute,
but he's young,

09:52.999 --> 09:54.999
and I'm not into him.

09:54.999 --> 09:55.999

09:55.999 --> 09:56.999
If you're gonna pet me,
then pet me.

09:56.999 --> 09:59.999
If you're gonna rub, rub.

09:59.999 --> 10:03.999
You are so close to just
hitting a ball out of the park,

10:03.999 --> 10:06.999
and all you got to do
is look at the ball.

10:06.999 --> 10:09.999
- I asked Captain Lee if we
could go out for dinner tonight.

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
- I would love to go
on a date,

10:10.999 --> 10:12.999
and you, like,
are telepathic.

10:12.999 --> 10:13.999
- Synchronized.

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
- Oh, Emile,
let me get in here.

10:15.999 --> 10:16.999
Oh, Emile.

10:16.999 --> 10:19.999
- I'm not sure if Rocky
is just a tease

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
or if there's
something else there.

10:21.999 --> 10:22.999
- Oh, give me--
oh, just rub my neck.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.999
Ohh.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.999
- Don't get me horny.
- [laughs]

10:27.999 --> 10:30.999
- Good first step, just don't
flirt with him as much.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.999
- When I'm into somebody,
I'm into somebody,

10:33.999 --> 10:34.999
but he's not getting it.

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
If I really liked you, man,
I'd already have you.

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
It'd be done.
It'd be a done deal.

10:38.999 --> 10:39.999
You guys
are absolutely right.

10:39.999 --> 10:42.000
I need to draw the line
because I could see

10:42.999 --> 10:44.000
where it could get blurry,
and it's my fault.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.999
And I don't want to hurt
his feelings.

10:45.999 --> 10:47.999
- Why don't you just tell him
you have a boyfriend?

10:47.999 --> 10:49.000
- I don't even think
that would stop him.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.999
I think I have to go
one step further and tell him,

10:50.999 --> 10:52.999
like, I'm into chicks, and,
like, Connie's on the radar.

10:52.999 --> 10:55.999
- I think that would
probably encourage him.

10:55.999 --> 10:57.999
- Really?

10:57.999 --> 10:58.999
- I know what you should do.

10:58.999 --> 11:01.999
You should bang...Dane.

11:01.999 --> 11:02.999
- No.

11:02.999 --> 11:05.999
Plan B,
buy Emile a hooker.

11:07.999 --> 11:08.999
- There's hookers here?

11:08.999 --> 11:10.999
- I'm sure
we can find one.

11:12.999 --> 11:14.999
So are you feeling good
about it?

11:14.999 --> 11:15.999
- Yeah.
- Is there any chance Rocky

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
could get a little time
in the galley with you?

11:17.999 --> 11:19.999
Because she's not
a stewardess really,

11:19.999 --> 11:22.999
and I feel bad
always correcting her.

11:22.999 --> 11:26.999
Putting Rocky in the galley
with Leon is perfect.

11:26.999 --> 11:29.999
She thinks it's a reward,
he thinks he's getting help,

11:29.999 --> 11:32.999
and I get both of them
out of my hair.

11:32.999 --> 11:34.999
- Okay. No problem.
No problem. Okay.

11:34.999 --> 11:35.999
- Yeah?

11:36.000 --> 11:37.999

happy as well.

11:37.999 --> 11:38.999
Rocky and I,
we've got a lot in common.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.999
She wants to become a chef.
I am a chef.

I don't like Kate.

11:42.999 --> 11:43.999

on the "Queen Elizabeth 2,"

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
which is not actually
a yacht.

17:54.999 --> 17:56.999
It's actually
a very small cruise ship.

17:56.999 --> 17:57.999

17:58.999 --> 18:01.000

a wrong way to do everything.

20:58.999 --> 20:59.999
I don't care
if you think you know--

20:59.999 --> 21:03.999

to have three people

21:03.999 --> 21:04.999

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999

kind of loose and wishy-washy,

to be willing

22:26.999 --> 22:27.999

22:27.999 --> 22:29.999

26:06.999 --> 26:07.999
Oh, isn't this pretty?

26:07.999 --> 26:10.999
- Oh, look how nice it is.

26:10.999 --> 26:11.999
- Time for dinner.

26:14.999 --> 26:16.999
- So excited, Rocky.

26:16.999 --> 26:18.999
- Well, it's gonna be
a little longer,

26:18.999 --> 26:20.999
'cause they're not done yet.

26:21.999 --> 26:24.999
- No, there's
some leftover pork salad.

26:24.999 --> 26:26.999
That's what I had now.

26:26.999 --> 26:27.999
- Soon as the sorbet's done,
you can go, ladies.

26:27.999 --> 26:29.999
- Okay.
- Thank you.

26:29.999 --> 26:31.999
- I love the presentation.

26:31.999 --> 26:34.999
- I will do things that
I wouldn't do to my husband.

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
- Just so y'all know,
this is

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
a berry gazpacho
over mango, melon, and edamame.

26:38.999 --> 26:40.999
- Oh, here we go, Cindy.
You're all over this.

26:40.999 --> 26:42.999
Cindy loves
freaking gazpacho.

26:42.999 --> 26:45.999
- Gazpacho is bullsháá.

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
It's just a fancy name
for laziness.

26:47.999 --> 26:50.999
"I put the leftovers from lunch
in the Vitamix"...

26:50.999 --> 26:51.999
- [laughs]
Shut up.

26:51.999 --> 26:52.999
- "Pressed a button."

26:52.999 --> 26:54.999
These guests are on a yacht
with wonderful service

26:55.000 --> 26:56.999
and a beautiful setting.

26:56.999 --> 26:57.999
Of course it's gonna
taste good enough.

26:57.999 --> 26:59.999
I was like, "You know what?
Heat?

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
Nah.
Let's call it gazpacho."

27:02.999 --> 27:03.999
- [grunts]

27:03.999 --> 27:04.999
Do you like avocado?

27:04.999 --> 27:05.999
- You're just gonna
eat it now?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.999
- Ooh, look at that avocado.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.999
- Do you want the other half
of that, Dane?

27:09.999 --> 27:10.999
- Mm...

27:10.999 --> 27:11.999
- But you asked me.

27:11.999 --> 27:13.999
- I think I just want
a cookie.

27:13.999 --> 27:15.000
- This fáááing chicken.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.999
I should've put it in
way earlier.

27:19.999 --> 27:20.999
- Are these ready to go now?

27:20.999 --> 27:21.999
- Yeah, as soon as the sauce
is on it.

27:21.999 --> 27:22.999
- Great, thank you.

27:24.999 --> 27:26.999
So just so y'all know,
this is roast chicken

27:26.999 --> 27:29.999
with carrots, diced potatoes,
and asparagus.

27:29.999 --> 27:31.999
- Nummy, nummy.
Thanks.

27:32.999 --> 27:33.999
- Why is crew dinner late?

27:33.999 --> 27:35.000
- Because Rocky's
making it.

27:35.999 --> 27:36.999
- Oh.

27:36.999 --> 27:38.999
- Here it is.
Come get it.

27:38.999 --> 27:41.999
- Look at you.
I'm about to grub down.

27:41.999 --> 27:43.999
- Actually really looks good.

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
- Is it good?

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
- Needs a little more seasoning,
but it's good.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.999
After a day like today,
I just want some sustenance.

27:49.999 --> 27:50.999
I want something
to fill my belly

27:50.999 --> 27:53.000
that's gonna make me feel good
and keep me going.

27:57.999 --> 28:00.999
Does that look raw to you?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.999
- The-the chicken...
- Mmm.

28:02.999 --> 28:03.999
- Should be cooked to--

28:03.999 --> 28:05.999
- Dude, this is raw.

28:05.999 --> 28:06.999
Fááá.

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
- I am so full.

28:13.999 --> 28:14.999
- How the fááá
are you full?

28:14.999 --> 28:16.999
Like, I could eat
a whole nother platter.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.999
- Listen, hot tub,
and then burgers.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.999
Stacey, what did you want?
Double fudge brownie?

28:22.999 --> 28:23.999
- I like cream cheese brownies.

28:23.999 --> 28:25.999
- We're gonna have
sliders with that.

28:25.999 --> 28:28.999
- Basically, he wants
what a pot smoker would want.

28:28.999 --> 28:29.999
[laughter]

28:29.999 --> 28:31.000
Brownies and fries.

28:31.999 --> 28:32.999
- That sounds delicious.

28:32.999 --> 28:33.999
- It does sound
like a pot smoker.

28:33.999 --> 28:35.999
It totally does.
[laughter]

28:35.999 --> 28:37.999
- Okay, well,
I'm gonna pass this on,

28:37.999 --> 28:38.999
and then I'll be back.

28:38.999 --> 28:39.999
- Thank you.

28:39.999 --> 28:42.999
- So the guests have requested
chocolate cream cheese brownies

28:42.999 --> 28:47.999
to enjoy in the hot tub and also
some cheeseburger sliders.

28:47.999 --> 28:48.999
- Great.
- So--

28:48.999 --> 28:50.999
- I'll take those down.

28:50.999 --> 28:56.999
Leon is a very...
regimented individual.

28:56.999 --> 28:57.999
Even though the guests
requested this,

28:57.999 --> 29:01.999
I know he's not gonna like it,
but I don't care.

29:01.999 --> 29:04.999
Hey, Leon.
- Oui?

29:04.999 --> 29:08.999
- The guests have requested
some mini cheeseburger sliders.

29:08.999 --> 29:09.999
- No.
- I'm sorry, what?

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
- Oh, can you turn it back on?

29:12.999 --> 29:15.999
And then also
some cream cheese brownies.

29:15.999 --> 29:17.999
- Cream cheese brownies.
- Yeah.

29:17.999 --> 29:18.999
- Fááá, I've just
fed youse guys,

29:18.999 --> 29:20.999
and now you want this?

29:20.999 --> 29:23.999
I have met so many guests
in my life.

29:23.999 --> 29:25.999
It'd be nice to not find
a crazy one.

29:25.999 --> 29:26.999
That's bullsháá.

29:28.999 --> 29:30.999
- We are going to the dock.

29:30.999 --> 29:31.999
- How we looking
on getting all the fenders out?

29:31.999 --> 29:33.999
Fáááing sick.

29:33.999 --> 29:37.999
I really need my deck crew
to perform on this.

29:37.999 --> 29:40.999
- Got a couple of things
I'd like to bring up.

29:45.999 --> 29:47.999
- Whatever.

29:47.999 --> 29:48.999
- Just so we can calibrate
the radar.

29:48.999 --> 29:49.999
Kate's gonna hook you
with a reflector. Go there.

29:49.999 --> 29:53.999
Kate, I'm sending Dane to you
to get the reflector.

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
- If you have somebody
that's really green

29:57.999 --> 29:59.999
and new to yachting,
sometimes it's fun

29:59.999 --> 30:03.999
to blatantly take advantage
of their ignorance.

30:03.999 --> 30:04.999
All right,
I'm gonna activate the radar.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.999
Give me one hand at 9:00
and one at 3:00, please.

30:07.999 --> 30:09.999
Okay, give me one hand
at midnight

30:09.999 --> 30:11.000
and one at 9:00.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.999
Give me one at 6:00.

30:12.999 --> 30:13.999
6:00, not 6:30.

30:13.999 --> 30:15.999
That's 20 to 7:00.
Move it over to your left.

30:15.999 --> 30:16.999
- There you go.
- There you go, there you go.

30:16.999 --> 30:17.999
- This is pretty ridiculous,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.999
but, um, you know,
Captain's orders.

30:20.999 --> 30:21.999
- All right,
I gotta have a little motion.

30:21.999 --> 30:23.999
Yeah, that's it.

30:23.999 --> 30:25.999
I think we almost got it.
Squat down a little.

30:25.999 --> 30:26.999
[laughter]
- Oh, yes.

30:26.999 --> 30:27.999
- Hold that right there.

30:33.999 --> 30:37.999
- The guests have requested
some mini cheeseburger sliders.

30:37.999 --> 30:38.999
- No.

30:39.999 --> 30:40.999
- I'm sorry, what?

30:41.999 --> 30:42.999
- Oh, can you turn it back on?

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
- You have no ground beef?

30:45.999 --> 30:46.999
- No. Steak.

30:46.999 --> 30:47.999
- Steak sliders would be nice

30:47.999 --> 30:50.999
and also
some cream cheese brownies.

30:50.999 --> 30:51.999
- Cream cheese brownies?

30:51.999 --> 30:53.999
- Yeah.

30:53.999 --> 30:55.999
- That's bullsháá.

30:55.999 --> 30:57.999
The guests want sliders, and
I didn't have any mincemeat.

30:57.999 --> 30:59.999
These are not things
Kate thinks about.

30:59.999 --> 31:00.999
She just comes down
and reels everything off

31:00.999 --> 31:04.000
and thinking that I can just
pull stuff out my ass.

31:04.999 --> 31:05.999
It's not as easy as that.
You know what I mean?

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
When do they want 'em?
Right now?

31:07.999 --> 31:08.999
- Yes. Well, they're gonna go
jump in the Jacuzzi.

31:08.999 --> 31:11.999
- That's not gonna happen. I've
gotta make the brownie mix and--

31:11.999 --> 31:13.999
Be about half an hour.
- Okay. Oh, that's--

31:13.999 --> 31:14.999
yeah, they don't want it
right now.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.999
- Quit sipping
on that weak sauce.

31:16.999 --> 31:18.000
- I'm getting my suit on.
Jacob's with me.

31:18.999 --> 31:20.999
- I'll meet you there.
I'm finishing my wine.

31:23.999 --> 31:26.999
- Oh, Smokey Robinson.

31:26.999 --> 31:27.999
- Those are gonna be the buns?
That's a great idea.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
- Eye--what?
- Filet of beef.

31:31.999 --> 31:32.999
- Oh, okay.

31:32.999 --> 31:33.999
- Well, I thought
Kate was joking

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
to see what type of reaction
I was gonna get,

31:35.999 --> 31:36.999
but I'm not gonna
give her the joy.

31:36.999 --> 31:38.999
End of the day,
you're there for the guests,

31:38.999 --> 31:39.999
and that's
what it boils down to.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.999
- Thank you.

31:42.999 --> 31:43.999
- Literally, I could
sleep right here.

31:43.999 --> 31:44.999
- [laughs]

31:44.999 --> 31:46.999
- Oh, my--
- Sliders!

31:46.999 --> 31:47.999
- They're actually
filet sliders.

31:47.999 --> 31:48.999
- Whoo!

31:48.999 --> 31:49.999
- Chef Leon made them.

31:49.999 --> 31:51.999
- Do you want to take
those cream cheese things up?

31:51.999 --> 31:53.999
- Yum, cream cheese
chocolate brownies.

31:53.999 --> 31:54.999
- Oh, sháá!

31:54.999 --> 31:55.999
- Oh, my God,
that's so good.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
- Did you have
one of these brownies?

31:57.999 --> 31:58.999
It's like an explosion
in your mouth.

31:58.999 --> 32:01.999
- They're really happy
with the sliders and fries.

32:01.999 --> 32:02.999
- Right.

32:02.999 --> 32:05.999
- This type of request
is so typical.

32:05.999 --> 32:07.999
The fact that Leon
is reacting this way

32:07.999 --> 32:11.999
makes me wonder, like,
maybe yachting's not for you.

32:11.999 --> 32:15.999
- I'm gonna go downstairs
and have a drink.

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
Sháá.

32:17.999 --> 32:18.999
- What are
these little floating lights?

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999
[laughter]
- Here we go.

32:20.999 --> 32:21.999

you were us, Cindy?

32:28.999 --> 32:29.999
- No.

32:29.999 --> 32:31.999
- Protect the eyelashes!

32:31.999 --> 32:34.999
- They are all inebriated
and out of control.

32:34.999 --> 32:35.999

These ladies,
they've got husbands at home.

32:37.999 --> 32:38.999
They've got kids at home.

and flew to a yacht

35:04.999 --> 35:07.999

that if y'all would be

35:07.999 --> 35:10.999
more comfortable at the dock,
we can go ahead and head in.

35:10.999 --> 35:12.999
It's really up to you.

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999

to the dock.

an executive decision.

35:35.999 --> 35:39.999
I really need my deck crew
to perform on this.

35:39.999 --> 35:42.999
Otherwise, Captain might
blow a gasket.

35:43.999 --> 35:44.999

the other one out.

You got 60 feet

having y'all on board.

I wish I could send
some of my crew members

36:36.999 --> 36:39.000

instead of these guests.

36:39.999 --> 36:41.999

asked for a better trip.

That was fantastic.
Yeah.

a hard day.

36:58.999 --> 36:59.999
- So what made it hard?

more than anything else.

in the kitchen for a while, so--

able to sleep through the night

38:20.999 --> 38:22.999
- 15 grand for the charter
is not bad,

38:22.999 --> 38:24.999

that my crew

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
is not performing
to the standards that I have.

on the docking today,

38:45.999 --> 38:48.000
you had your head in the game

without a hitch,

get things accomplished

Okay?

the interior and the galley.

I just want it dealt with.

it gets dealt with.

- You got your fááá--

42:51.999 --> 42:52.999
- Get your finger
out of my face.

42:52.999 --> 42:54.999
Back off.

42:54.999 --> 42:55.999
[alarm blaring]
- It's a fire. That's a fire.

42:55.999 --> 42:56.999
- Where?
- It's in there.

42:56.999 --> 42:57.999
- Oh, my eyes!

42:57.999 --> 42:58.999
- Oh, fááá.

42:58.999 --> 43:00.999
- You're just gonna
walk away?

43:00.999 --> 43:03.999
Rocky.
Yeah, she's jumping.

43:03.999 --> 43:05.999
- Attention, all crew,
prepare your seatbelts

43:05.999 --> 43:07.999
because we are right
in the middle of a sháá storm.

43:07.999 --> 43:10.999
- It fáááing stops
here and now.

43:10.999 --> 43:12.999
There's your ticket.
Get the fááá off.
