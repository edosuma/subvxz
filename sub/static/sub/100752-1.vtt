WEBVTT

00:44.526 --> 00:46.363
Come on, come on,
they're gaining on us.

00:46.428 --> 00:47.730
I'll lose 'em.

00:50.901 --> 00:53.036
Yeah, that's right.

00:53.103 --> 00:54.304
- Look out!
- Ahhh!

00:56.873 --> 00:59.876
Oh, gee. Sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.312
Huh?

01:04.881 --> 01:08.517
Stop.
That tickles.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.466
Oh, wow!

01:24.533 --> 01:26.468
Still getting used
to that strength thing.

01:26.535 --> 01:28.771
- Everybody okay?
- Huh?

01:28.837 --> 01:32.042
Good. Now hand me
those weapons.

01:32.108 --> 01:33.542
Where are my manners?

01:33.609 --> 01:35.577
Please hand me those weapons.

01:35.644 --> 01:37.347
Can't believe
I forgot the "please."

01:37.414 --> 01:38.814
Wow.

01:40.516 --> 01:42.818
Okay, I hope you learned
your lesson.

01:42.886 --> 01:45.255
Crime doesn't pay.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.856
<i>Adios.</i>

01:49.259 --> 01:51.428
Who is that guy?
A new superhero?

01:51.493 --> 01:54.097
Yeah, a super polite hero.

01:57.934 --> 01:59.768
Come on.

01:59.835 --> 02:02.038
Are you ready
to do this deal?

02:02.105 --> 02:03.139
As long as you don't get

02:03.206 --> 02:06.242
cold flippers
like last time, Penguin.

02:06.309 --> 02:08.811
Hah, cold flippers.

02:14.184 --> 02:15.151
Ahem!

02:15.218 --> 02:16.853
What? Who was that?

02:16.920 --> 02:18.821
Up here.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.390
I didn't wanna be rude
and interrupt

02:20.457 --> 02:22.524
but, well,
then I did because,

02:22.591 --> 02:24.526
you know, criminal activity.

02:24.593 --> 02:25.828
Get him, boys.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.068
I've had enough of being
tickled today, thank you.

02:32.135 --> 02:34.803
Now, how about everyone
comes along quietly?

02:34.871 --> 02:37.840
Hah, not likely, Red.

02:37.907 --> 02:41.978
Lasers don't hurt me,
so you think that chains will?

02:42.045 --> 02:45.614
Come on, guys, I was trying
not to prejudge you.

02:48.617 --> 02:50.887
So... quietly then?

02:53.957 --> 02:56.393
Mitzi. Mitzi girl.

03:01.663 --> 03:03.366
Is there a problem, miss?

03:03.433 --> 03:05.869
Mitzi, she's stuck
in the tree.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.004
Don't worry, I'll get her.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.374
Come on, little kitten.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.708
Whoa!

03:12.775 --> 03:14.676
Ho-ho! Look at you.

03:14.743 --> 03:17.447
Wow, how did you get up here?

03:17.514 --> 03:20.283
Oh.

03:20.350 --> 03:22.185
Come here. Here you go.

03:22.252 --> 03:24.421
Try to keep her
on a leash from now on.

03:24.487 --> 03:26.456
Not only is it practical,

03:26.523 --> 03:27.957
it's the law.

03:28.757 --> 03:31.061
So long.

03:31.127 --> 03:35.198
Wow, that's the nicest
superhero ever.

03:43.306 --> 03:46.009
Okay, no one around, so...

03:46.076 --> 03:47.310
Shazam!

03:54.484 --> 03:56.819
Best day ever!

04:00.722 --> 04:02.258
Well, well, well,

04:02.325 --> 04:05.661
little boy Batson
has finally returned.

04:05.727 --> 04:08.198
Oh, hey, Terrance,
Corey, Brian.

04:08.264 --> 04:09.265
How are you guys today?

04:09.332 --> 04:11.834
Great. In fact,
better than great.

04:11.901 --> 04:13.602
I don't know where
you went off to today,

04:13.669 --> 04:16.705
but you missed out on a
nice couple from Metropolis

04:16.772 --> 04:19.242
looking for a well-behaved
little boy.

04:19.309 --> 04:22.345
And since you were gone,
they picked me.

04:25.281 --> 04:27.917
I'm really happy
for you, Terrance.

04:27.984 --> 04:31.321
Oh, I bet you are, Billy,
you're always selfless

04:31.387 --> 04:35.492
and that's why you'll always
end up alone.

04:39.429 --> 04:41.630
Later, little Billy.

04:41.697 --> 04:44.367
Better luck next time.

04:44.434 --> 04:45.701
Come on, guys.

04:45.767 --> 04:47.604
Did I say "best"?

04:47.669 --> 04:49.705
I meant worst day ever.

04:51.474 --> 04:54.444
Take a look at these.
"Lightning guy stops robbery."

04:54.511 --> 04:56.379
"Big cheese foils Falcone."

04:56.446 --> 04:58.680
"Hero saves dog in tree."

04:58.747 --> 05:00.183
He saved a dog from a tree?

05:00.250 --> 05:02.352
I mean, even Superman
doesn't do that.

05:02.418 --> 05:05.654
I'm sure Superman would
save a dog from a tree

05:05.721 --> 05:07.257
if he ever saw one.

05:07.323 --> 05:10.560
Maybe if we were paying
attention instead of talking,

05:10.627 --> 05:12.495
we'd know, wouldn't we, Kent?

05:12.562 --> 05:13.795
Sorry, Mr. White.

05:13.863 --> 05:15.899
I don't want sorry,
I want answers.

05:15.965 --> 05:17.400
Who is he?
Where is he from?

05:17.467 --> 05:20.203
What's his name?
I mean, look at that profile.

05:20.270 --> 05:22.305
His chin looks like
it was made of marble.

05:22.372 --> 05:25.341
That's it. We'll call him
"Captain Marble."

05:25.408 --> 05:26.876
Already taken, Chief.

05:26.943 --> 05:29.711
Is it? It doesn't matter.
Point is, what does he want?

05:29.778 --> 05:31.014
Why is he so polite?

05:31.080 --> 05:32.949
This is the story
of the century.

05:33.016 --> 05:36.286
And I want a <i>Daily Planet</i>
exclusive yesterday.

05:38.121 --> 05:40.256
Well, what are you all
standing around for?

05:40.323 --> 05:41.690
Go, go!

05:41.757 --> 05:43.226
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

05:43.293 --> 05:45.295
- No, it's okay...
- This is...

05:45.361 --> 05:46.963
Yeesh.

05:47.030 --> 05:48.398
- Kent.
- Yeah, I was just

05:48.464 --> 05:50.333
about to go out
and get you that interview,

05:50.400 --> 05:51.501
Mr. White.

05:51.568 --> 05:52.969
Ah, don't worry
about that, son,

05:53.036 --> 05:55.104
superheroes have never
been your strong suit.

05:55.171 --> 05:56.639
Well, I don't know about that.

05:56.705 --> 05:58.341
I have another assignment
for you.

05:58.408 --> 06:01.010
Something important,
something meaningful,

06:01.077 --> 06:03.146
something that
only you can do.

06:03.213 --> 06:05.448
I won't let you down,
Mr. White. What is it?

06:05.515 --> 06:08.750
I need 1,000 words about the
Metropolis Farmer's Market by tomorrow.

06:08.817 --> 06:10.719
They have this amazing
fertilizer exhibit

06:10.786 --> 06:12.121
and if there's one person
that knows

06:12.188 --> 06:14.224
how to write about manure,
it's you, Kent.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.725
Sure thing, Mr. White.

06:30.006 --> 06:32.642
Like, is this radish organic?

06:32.709 --> 06:34.344
Absolutely, grew it myself.

06:34.410 --> 06:37.213
Well, how can
I be sure, dude?

06:37.280 --> 06:38.780
Well, uh...

06:39.916 --> 06:42.619
So good.

06:42.685 --> 06:44.287
Organic.

06:44.354 --> 06:45.321
Told you.

06:48.091 --> 06:49.758
Dang juicer.

06:49.825 --> 06:52.495
I can't seem
to get this down.

06:52.562 --> 06:55.999
Oh. Thanks, stranger.

07:00.470 --> 07:02.572
Gather all the food
for the master,

07:02.639 --> 07:04.440
he must be appeased.

07:16.953 --> 07:21.024
Master will be pleased.

07:21.090 --> 07:23.493
I mean, I was a farmer.

07:23.559 --> 07:26.795
So, of course I guess I should
report on the farmer's market.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.731
And, by golly,
I'm gonna give Mr. White

07:28.797 --> 07:31.768
the best article on perennial
produce he's ever seen.

07:31.833 --> 07:33.569
Help! Monsters!

07:33.636 --> 07:34.537
Someone's in trouble.

07:36.773 --> 07:38.141
Looks like Clark Kent

07:38.207 --> 07:41.044
isn't the only one with
an assignment today.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.322
Huh? Grr.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.489
Don't you know?

07:53.556 --> 07:56.626
Stealing is never part
of a healthy diet.

08:03.832 --> 08:06.069
Puny Kryptonian.

08:06.803 --> 08:08.204
Well, then.

08:11.674 --> 08:13.609
All right, what do you have?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.179
Sister Eye!

08:16.746 --> 08:17.914
No.

08:17.980 --> 08:19.848
Oh, well, how about...

08:19.916 --> 08:21.684
Cousin Eye?

08:23.853 --> 08:25.421
Trouble alert.

08:25.488 --> 08:28.291
Uh, excuse me. Did... Did...
I didn't hear what you said.

08:28.358 --> 08:29.892
- Did you say something?
- I gotta go.

08:29.959 --> 08:31.327
Uh, Mr. Wayne, I didn't...

08:31.394 --> 08:33.796
I didn't even get to tell you
about Grandpa Eye.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.278
- Uh-oh.
- Need a hand?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.216
That'd be super.

09:27.283 --> 09:29.352
Take care of these guys,
I've got a train to catch.

09:33.256 --> 09:36.726
Oh, come on, you have
to do better than that.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.362
By the authority
of the Green Lantern Corps,

09:39.429 --> 09:41.097
I command you to surrender.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.932
Bah! The mighty Oom

09:42.999 --> 09:45.368
doesn't answer to
your puny Lantern Corps.

09:57.313 --> 09:58.181
Huh?

09:59.816 --> 10:02.618
Oh, no, the bridge is out.

10:05.955 --> 10:07.957
Hey, look, it's Superman.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.525
Save us, Superman.

10:11.093 --> 10:12.295
Oh!

10:19.602 --> 10:20.470
Huh?

10:38.321 --> 10:40.523
Next stop, Metropolis Central.

10:42.792 --> 10:45.061
Yes, Superman.

10:49.265 --> 10:50.968
Just because you're evil

10:51.033 --> 10:52.435
doesn't mean
your breath should be.

10:52.502 --> 10:54.604
Go brush your teeth.

10:56.339 --> 10:58.341
You're the Dummy,
right?

10:58.407 --> 11:00.376
Yeesh, way to set
the bar low.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.423
Ha-hah! Too slow, Dummy.

11:19.295 --> 11:21.097
I got this.

11:23.065 --> 11:24.033
Huh?

11:26.702 --> 11:28.437
Uh, like, thanks, man.

11:28.504 --> 11:31.541
- How did you...
- Speed of Mercury, isn't it cool?

11:31.607 --> 11:32.642
Oh, hey, one sec.

11:32.708 --> 11:33.911
No, wait, who are you?

11:38.714 --> 11:40.750
Okay, yeah, that's good.

11:40.816 --> 11:43.819
I'm sure this thing has
a weight limit, so...

11:43.887 --> 11:45.022
I've got it.

11:45.087 --> 11:46.422
Strength of Hercules.

11:46.489 --> 11:49.292
I could do this all day,
but who has the time?

11:50.192 --> 11:51.327
- Pardon me.
- Huh?

11:51.394 --> 11:53.195
I think you misplaced these.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.399
Well, that takes care of that.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.268
Hi. I'm...

11:59.335 --> 12:01.804
By the arm hairs of Atlas,

12:01.872 --> 12:03.040
are you okay?

12:03.105 --> 12:04.807
You know Atlas?
That's so cool.

12:04.875 --> 12:08.144
I've got the stamina of Atlas,
isn't that rad?

12:08.210 --> 12:10.746
I barely even felt
getting hit.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.748
But I bet he will.

12:22.224 --> 12:23.225
Thanks.

12:23.292 --> 12:24.393
Don't mention it.

12:26.195 --> 12:27.797
- There's only room for one bat person around here.
- Huh?

12:27.864 --> 12:29.098
Don't you think?

12:37.640 --> 12:40.176
The master
must be satisfied.

12:40.242 --> 12:41.611
But not today.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.879
Retreat!

13:02.765 --> 13:04.400
We have to go after them.

13:08.337 --> 13:09.906
Later.

13:09.973 --> 13:12.308
Right now, we have to stop
that building from collapsing.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.949
I don't know if sunbathing on
the roof was such a great idea.

13:19.016 --> 13:20.017
Whoa!

13:20.083 --> 13:21.417
<i>All right, everybody,</i>

13:21.484 --> 13:22.685
<i>now shake your body.</i>

13:22.752 --> 13:24.787
<i>Loosen those limbs.</i>

13:24.855 --> 13:27.223
This is fun.

13:34.530 --> 13:36.666
<i>Come on, you can do it.</i>

13:36.732 --> 13:38.434
<i>It should feel like
you're climbing</i>

13:38.501 --> 13:41.004
<i>up the side of
a mountain. Yeah!</i>

13:45.508 --> 13:47.309
Your turn, Flash.

13:50.147 --> 13:51.480
I'm on it.

14:00.023 --> 14:01.091
You're safe here, ma'am.

14:01.158 --> 14:02.358
Gotta run.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.963
Wow.

14:18.674 --> 14:20.977
I'm here to offer
some support.

14:23.512 --> 14:25.182
<i>And jump, two, three.</i>

14:26.615 --> 14:28.317
<i>Two, three, four.</i>

14:42.966 --> 14:45.401
- <i>And one.</i>
- Wow, what a workout.

14:45.468 --> 14:48.872
What in
the blue blazes?

14:48.939 --> 14:51.340
I think you can let go now.

14:51.407 --> 14:53.709
Oh. Uh, heh, right.

14:55.377 --> 14:56.746
Oh, my gosh,
I can't believe it,

14:56.812 --> 14:59.415
Flash, you just ran up
those bricks like "zoom."

14:59.482 --> 15:01.383
And Wonder Woman
with the lasso,

15:01.450 --> 15:03.186
you were all...

15:03.252 --> 15:05.287
And Superman,
with the heat vision,

15:05.354 --> 15:07.858
you secured the base
with a "pssh."

15:07.924 --> 15:09.358
Batman swung in

15:09.425 --> 15:11.627
and caught that guy
while Green Lantern

15:11.694 --> 15:13.930
was putting the wall
back together.

15:13.997 --> 15:17.033
You guys are incredible!

15:17.100 --> 15:19.936
It is such an amazing
pleasure to meet you.

15:20.003 --> 15:23.372
You have been my hero
since I was just a kid.

15:23.974 --> 15:25.608
Oop, sorry.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.276
Since you were a kid?

15:27.343 --> 15:28.677
By my observations,

15:28.744 --> 15:30.914
you're approximately
the same age as Superman.

15:30.981 --> 15:34.283
Same age? Oh, no, uh...
I just meant that

15:34.350 --> 15:36.920
watching you makes me
feel like a kid.

15:36.987 --> 15:38.320
Hmm.

15:38.387 --> 15:40.456
Anyway, what a thrill
to meet you guys,

15:40.523 --> 15:41.858
I hope I didn't get in the way.

15:41.925 --> 15:44.727
Not at all.
In fact, we're grateful.

15:44.794 --> 15:46.096
Mister...

15:46.163 --> 15:47.998
Oh, uh, sorry.

15:48.064 --> 15:49.331
I'm Shazam.

15:49.398 --> 15:50.766
Uh... Shaz-what now?

15:50.833 --> 15:51.667
Well, Shaz-bot.

15:51.734 --> 15:53.602
- Shazam.
- Excuse me.

15:53.669 --> 15:57.573
Shazam, it was pretty courageous
of you to leap into danger like that.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.442
I know, that's one
of my powers too.

16:00.509 --> 16:01.978
Courage of Achilles.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.346
I used it just the other day
to eat some anchovies.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.051
How can we be sure
you're one of the good guys?

16:08.118 --> 16:09.318
Totally understandable.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.719
But even if I wasn't,

16:10.786 --> 16:12.721
a great philosopher
once said,

16:12.788 --> 16:15.524
"Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer."

16:15.591 --> 16:18.360
So, really what
do you have to lose?

16:18.427 --> 16:20.396
Yep, I know quotes.

16:20.462 --> 16:21.998
Wisdom of Solomon.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.833
Sweet, am I right?

16:23.900 --> 16:26.802
Why does he keep mentioning
Solomon, Atlas and the others?

16:26.870 --> 16:28.939
- Well, I...
- His powers obviously derive

16:29.005 --> 16:31.407
from each of the ancient heroes
he's described,

16:31.473 --> 16:33.442
that makes up
the name "Shazam."

16:33.509 --> 16:34.844
S for the wisdom of Solomon.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.579
H for the strength of Hercules.

16:36.645 --> 16:38.347
A for the stamina of Atlas.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.783
Another A for
the courage of Achilles.

16:40.851 --> 16:43.686
And M for
the speed of Mercury.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.223
That means that
Z must stand for...

16:46.289 --> 16:48.591
The power of Zeus.

16:48.657 --> 16:51.061
Still haven't figure out
what that is myself.

16:51.127 --> 16:52.561
Well, whoever you are,

16:52.628 --> 16:54.164
we really appreciate
your help.

16:54.231 --> 16:57.466
My pleasure. I mean,
helping the Justice League,

16:57.533 --> 16:58.567
so awesome!

16:58.634 --> 16:59.802
You should tag along.

16:59.870 --> 17:01.637
Come to the Hall of Justice,

17:01.704 --> 17:02.838
see where the magic happens.

17:02.906 --> 17:05.041
- I don't think...
- Seriously?

17:05.108 --> 17:06.508
The Hall of Justice?

17:06.575 --> 17:09.045
Like, <i>the</i> Hall of Justice?

17:09.112 --> 17:10.881
Oh, man, I... I...

17:15.584 --> 17:17.020
Be cool.

17:17.087 --> 17:18.088
This is the greatest thing

17:18.154 --> 17:19.155
that's ever happened to you

17:19.222 --> 17:20.789
but just... be cool.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.525
I mean, I guess so.

17:23.592 --> 17:25.394
I don't have
anything going on,

17:25.461 --> 17:27.830
so, uh, yeah, whatever.

17:30.432 --> 17:31.902
It's not our fault.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.203
Jeepers is right.

17:33.270 --> 17:34.371
We would've had your food

17:34.470 --> 17:35.571
but the Justice League
showed up

17:35.638 --> 17:37.207
and ruined everything.

17:37.274 --> 17:38.474
Enough!

17:38.540 --> 17:40.609
I'm tired of excuses.

17:40.676 --> 17:42.611
What I need is food.

17:42.678 --> 17:44.513
And if you can't get it,

17:44.580 --> 17:47.083
then I, Mr. Mind,

17:47.150 --> 17:49.019
will find others who can.

17:53.290 --> 17:55.158
<i>Yes.</i>

17:55.225 --> 17:58.228
<i>So powerful, so hungry.</i>

17:58.295 --> 18:00.496
<i>So hungry.</i>

18:00.562 --> 18:04.466
Yes, food,
I need more food.

18:06.036 --> 18:11.174
Excuse me. Sivana,
how goes our small experiment?

18:15.544 --> 18:17.080
It's done.

18:17.147 --> 18:19.815
This magically infused chemical
should do what you wanted.

18:19.883 --> 18:23.585
Now, can you stop
mind-controlling me and let me go?

18:23.652 --> 18:25.388
Hmm, nope.

18:25.454 --> 18:27.523
Now jump like a kangaroo.

18:29.225 --> 18:31.294
Mind control is the best.

18:31.361 --> 18:35.999
<i>Eat. Eat. Hunger.</i>

18:36.066 --> 18:38.335
Food.
Bring me more food.

18:38.401 --> 18:41.737
I must have more before
the Justice League arrives.

18:41.804 --> 18:43.406
The Justice League?

18:43.472 --> 18:45.641
Here? But how?

18:45.708 --> 18:48.244
Call it intuition.

18:55.285 --> 18:57.786
And over here, we have
our trouble alert system.

18:57.854 --> 18:59.788
If there's a problem
anywhere in the world,

18:59.856 --> 19:01.291
we'll know about it.

19:01.358 --> 19:04.827
This is incredible!

19:04.894 --> 19:08.898
I...
I think I might cry.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.601
Hall of Justice branded tissue?

19:13.470 --> 19:14.904
Can I keep this?

19:14.971 --> 19:16.906
Highly unsanitary.

19:16.973 --> 19:19.142
Totally going
in my scrapbook.

19:19.209 --> 19:22.479
You guys, I really can't
thank you enough for the tour.

19:22.544 --> 19:24.914
You all mean so much to me.

19:24.981 --> 19:28.717
The Justice League has always
been a beacon of hope.

19:28.784 --> 19:31.087
In the darkest of times,
I've always said,

19:31.154 --> 19:33.089
"What would
the Justice League do?"

19:33.156 --> 19:34.224
I mean...

19:34.290 --> 19:35.691
It depends on your roster,

19:35.758 --> 19:37.826
that Plastic Man
is kind of different,

19:37.894 --> 19:39.528
but, uh, that doesn't matter.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.098
You guys have
helped me a lot.

19:42.165 --> 19:44.968
I might need one
of those hankies, Batman.

19:46.136 --> 19:48.238
Well, I better get going.

19:48.304 --> 19:51.774
I hope we do some superhero-ing
stuff together soon.

19:52.475 --> 19:53.575
No, wait.

19:54.710 --> 19:57.247
I call
a Justice League meeting.

19:57.313 --> 19:58.982
Is a meeting necessary?

19:59.049 --> 20:00.816
We should be out
finding these monsters.

20:00.884 --> 20:01.784
I have their location

20:01.851 --> 20:02.818
via the Bat-Tracer, and...

20:02.886 --> 20:04.487
You know the rules, Batman.

20:04.553 --> 20:06.089
If one of us
calls a meeting...

20:07.323 --> 20:08.992
Then we all must attend.

20:09.059 --> 20:11.227
Should I go or...

20:11.294 --> 20:12.996
No, stay right there.

20:13.063 --> 20:15.031
Krypto will keep you company.

20:18.068 --> 20:20.636
It's an ultrasonic whistle.

20:20.702 --> 20:22.638
One sec.

20:22.704 --> 20:25.108
A super-dog.

20:25.175 --> 20:27.810
Ah, hi, Krypto.
Aren't you cute?

20:27.877 --> 20:30.013
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.780
I think we should let him join.

20:31.847 --> 20:34.284
The League?
But we just met him.

20:34.350 --> 20:38.188
Not everyone is as reluctant to
join the League as you were, Batman.

20:38.254 --> 20:39.889
I like him.
And not just because

20:39.956 --> 20:41.558
he has a lightning bolt
on his chest,

20:41.623 --> 20:42.992
though that doesn't hurt.

20:43.059 --> 20:44.294
I'm with Flash,

20:44.360 --> 20:46.496
there's something
so innocent about him.

20:46.563 --> 20:47.629
You can't catch me.

20:47.696 --> 20:50.033
You can't catch me.

20:51.568 --> 20:53.236
Or juvenile.

20:53.303 --> 20:54.437
I saw we take a vote.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.738
All in favor,
raise your hand.

20:58.674 --> 21:01.277
Shazam,
we have an offer for you.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.711
An offer?

21:02.778 --> 21:04.914
We'd like to invite you
to become a member of...

21:04.981 --> 21:06.416
the Justice League.

21:06.483 --> 21:08.518
What? Is this for real?

21:08.585 --> 21:11.187
I... I... This isn't some
hidden camera show, is it?

21:11.254 --> 21:13.189
There are 24 cameras
in this room,

21:13.256 --> 21:16.226
none of which you could find
even with Superman's abilities.

21:16.292 --> 21:18.294
No, this isn't a prank.

21:18.361 --> 21:21.431
The reality is you fit all of
our Justice League criteria.

21:21.498 --> 21:23.366
- You have superpowers.
- Check.

21:23.433 --> 21:24.633
- Fight for good.
- Double check.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.236
And not a kid.

21:27.504 --> 21:28.737
Check-aroni.

21:28.804 --> 21:31.707
So, Shazam, what do you say?

21:31.773 --> 21:34.944
I... will be
the best Leaguer ever!

21:35.011 --> 21:37.846
I promise, seriously,
you'll never regret this.

21:37.914 --> 21:39.349
Shazam, the Justice League

21:39.415 --> 21:42.352
is more than a
well-tuned crime fighting unit.

21:42.418 --> 21:44.454
It's a family.

21:44.521 --> 21:47.023
A... family?

21:47.090 --> 21:49.492
And families
are built on trust.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.027
Shazam, we think that

21:51.094 --> 21:53.429
you could be a great
addition to the team.

21:53.496 --> 21:55.797
But in order for us
to fully trust you,

21:55.865 --> 21:58.401
we need to know
who you really are.

21:58.468 --> 22:00.370
Not the superhero.

22:00.436 --> 22:02.372
But, you.

22:02.438 --> 22:05.208
My, uh... Oh, no.

22:05.275 --> 22:07.510
Don't worry,
we'll go first.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.078
Well, except for Batman,

22:09.145 --> 22:12.248
he kind of gets an exception
because he's so grumpy.

22:12.315 --> 22:13.749
I'm not grumpy.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.257
Yeah,
I don't know you.

22:22.158 --> 22:23.825
No idea.

22:23.893 --> 22:26.429
I mean, that's not
even really a disguise.

22:26.496 --> 22:27.696
Well, sure it is.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.400
The star draws your view
from my face.

22:30.466 --> 22:31.401
Not really.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.172
Clark Kent?

22:36.239 --> 22:39.175
Oh, wow! You did
that amazing exposé

22:39.242 --> 22:40.809
on building
without instructions.

22:40.877 --> 22:42.811
That was fantastic.

22:42.879 --> 22:44.080
Oh, thanks,

22:44.147 --> 22:45.781
I worked really hard
on that piece.

22:45.847 --> 22:48.051
- Ahem.
- Oh, right.

22:48.117 --> 22:51.787
So, are you ready
to be part of the family?

22:52.488 --> 22:53.856
I...

22:54.324 --> 22:55.358
I...

22:57.193 --> 22:58.194
I can't.

23:00.096 --> 23:02.932
I'm sorry, I... I really am.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.234
I have to go.

23:05.235 --> 23:07.503
Just as I surmised,

23:07.570 --> 23:09.305
Shazam has something to hide,

23:09.372 --> 23:10.373
and this proves

23:10.440 --> 23:11.840
he is not to be trusted.

23:11.908 --> 23:13.209
But you hide everything.

23:13.276 --> 23:14.611
- Bat exemption.
- No, but I...

23:14.677 --> 23:16.412
Bat exemption.

23:16.479 --> 23:17.447
Now, come on.

23:17.513 --> 23:19.315
We have monsters to catch.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.587
Huh? Oh!

23:24.654 --> 23:26.556
Hmm. Mm.

23:28.291 --> 23:30.927
I can't believe I didn't just
join the Justice League.

23:30.994 --> 23:34.964
But if they knew that
I was just a kid...

23:35.031 --> 23:38.401
- Whoa, is that guy flying? Oh, man!
- Nice cape.

23:38.468 --> 23:41.437
I've never seen a superhero.
Wow.

23:47.410 --> 23:50.513
Look, Mommy,
Superman got a new costume.

23:50.580 --> 23:52.181
Bye, Red Superman.

24:25.814 --> 24:27.650
Stay still.

24:27.717 --> 24:29.552
How did you even get in here,

24:29.619 --> 24:31.921
you pesky beast?

24:31.988 --> 24:33.990
Oh, hello, Billy.

24:34.057 --> 24:35.824
How was your day?

24:35.892 --> 24:38.827
Oh, you know.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.097
It doesn't take a wizard

24:41.164 --> 24:43.132
to know something's
bothering you.

24:43.199 --> 24:46.202
But I'm a wizard,
so maybe it does.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.806
Billy, you can tell me
anything.

24:49.872 --> 24:52.375
I had
this great day, you know?

24:52.442 --> 24:56.145
Fighting bad guys,
meeting my heroes, but then...

24:56.212 --> 24:59.415
But then the Justice League
wanted me to join their team.

24:59.482 --> 25:01.484
That sounds wonderful.

25:02.385 --> 25:04.654
It was, except,

25:04.721 --> 25:05.888
in order to join,

25:05.955 --> 25:07.623
they said
they needed to trust me.

25:07.690 --> 25:11.327
Which means I would have
to reveal my secret identity.

25:11.394 --> 25:13.396
And you were afraid
they would reject you

25:13.463 --> 25:15.798
when they found out
you weren't an adult?

25:15.865 --> 25:17.166
Exactly.

25:17.233 --> 25:19.335
I know that, in your heart,

25:19.402 --> 25:22.438
all you've ever wanted
was a family, Billy.

25:22.505 --> 25:24.273
Somewhere to belong.

25:24.340 --> 25:26.909
I've tried to give you
that place,

25:26.976 --> 25:28.945
but my time is running out.

25:29.011 --> 25:31.681
Soon, you'll need
to find your own way.

25:31.748 --> 25:34.784
And you'll discover
that being in a family

25:34.852 --> 25:37.453
doesn't come without
its own risks.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.521
Risks?

25:38.588 --> 25:39.722
Like what?

25:39.789 --> 25:41.157
Trust, my son,

25:41.224 --> 25:44.260
trust to share a part
of yourself with others.

25:44.327 --> 25:47.296
And hope that those you
share it with will accept it.

25:47.363 --> 25:48.866
You're talking about
you sharing

25:48.931 --> 25:50.633
the power of Zeus
with me, right?

25:50.700 --> 25:53.603
The first guy you chose
to be the Wizard's champion?

25:53.669 --> 25:56.939
Well, I wouldn't say first.

25:57.006 --> 25:58.608
There was another.

26:00.343 --> 26:02.512
<i>His name was Teth Adam.</i>

26:02.578 --> 26:05.681
<i>Shazam!</i>

26:05.748 --> 26:08.451
<i>But he would become
Mighty Adam.</i>

26:08.518 --> 26:11.988
<i>He started out as
the hero I hoped he would be.</i>

26:13.322 --> 26:17.326
But I was blind not
to see his growing ambition.

26:17.393 --> 26:21.330
Soon, he was corrupted by
his power and turned to evil.

26:21.397 --> 26:24.000
<i>He tried to enslave the world,</i>

26:24.066 --> 26:26.469
<i>but after a long
and trying battle,</i>

26:26.536 --> 26:27.804
<i>I defeated him.</i>

26:29.071 --> 26:30.373
<i>No!</i>

26:30.440 --> 26:34.644
And thus, he became
Black Adam.

26:35.478 --> 26:36.914
What did you do?

26:36.979 --> 26:39.081
I locked him away

26:39.148 --> 26:42.318
where he can never harm
anyone again.

26:45.588 --> 26:48.057
The point is, Billy,
that even I,

26:48.124 --> 26:51.394
the wise and powerful Wizard,
risked something

26:51.461 --> 26:55.064
and continue to risk
by giving that power to you.

26:55.131 --> 26:57.767
My true champion.

26:57.834 --> 26:59.101
Aw, shucks.

26:59.168 --> 27:01.337
What is it?

27:07.477 --> 27:08.211
The League?

27:08.277 --> 27:11.047
I sense a trap. Go.

27:11.113 --> 27:12.648
And remember, Billy,

27:12.715 --> 27:16.887
nothing creates trust
like helping those in need.

27:16.954 --> 27:18.488
Wisdom of Solomon?

27:18.554 --> 27:20.456
No, common sense.

27:20.523 --> 27:21.557
Now go.

27:26.762 --> 27:28.664
There you are.

27:28.731 --> 27:32.568
Now just hold still.

27:34.770 --> 27:36.572
I hate moths.

27:43.881 --> 27:45.181
Fan out.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.795
No sign of anything
out of the ordinary.

27:59.863 --> 28:04.834
Strange. The Bat Radar
indicates the tracer should be right...

28:04.902 --> 28:06.402
where that box is.

28:06.469 --> 28:08.872
- Oh, I got it.
- No, it's a trap.

28:11.674 --> 28:13.809
Right as always, Batman.

28:20.349 --> 28:23.052
The Monster Society
welcomes you.

28:23.119 --> 28:26.489
Is that a talking worm? I mean,
come on, we fight worms now?

28:26.556 --> 28:28.959
I'm no mere worm, Flash.

28:29.026 --> 28:31.460
I'm the powerful Mr. Mind,

28:31.527 --> 28:34.330
the greatest villain
in the galaxy.

28:34.397 --> 28:37.034
Wanted in over three quadrants
of the universe

28:37.099 --> 28:39.101
for my evil evilness.

28:39.168 --> 28:44.073
And now I can add defeating the
Justice League to my accomplishments.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.309
Sivana, if you please?

28:47.510 --> 28:49.913
Huh?

28:52.648 --> 28:56.019
Though my powers of
mental persuasion are strong,

28:56.085 --> 29:00.924
I know they could never tame the
superheroic minds of the Justice League.

29:00.991 --> 29:04.627
Well, maybe the Flash.

29:04.694 --> 29:07.730
Thanks... a lot.

29:07.797 --> 29:11.001
You'll never...
get away with this.

29:11.068 --> 29:12.368
I already have.

29:12.435 --> 29:15.438
The adult mind
is hard to manipulate,

29:15.504 --> 29:18.140
but the mind of a child...

29:18.207 --> 29:20.476
Sivana, fans.

29:26.449 --> 29:28.351
- Huh?
- What?

29:30.386 --> 29:33.356
- It worked!
- Of course it worked.

29:33.422 --> 29:35.758
Dr. Sivana is no slouch.

29:35.825 --> 29:37.426
I'm a kid?

29:37.493 --> 29:40.529
Well, I'll be
butter-churned in July.

29:40.596 --> 29:42.465
But I don't wanna be a kid.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.467
What are you talking about?
I don't feel any different.

29:44.533 --> 29:47.436
Turn us back, Sivana,
this instant.

29:47.503 --> 29:51.041
Sivana can do
nothing and neither can you.

30:01.450 --> 30:02.953
Ah, so easy.

30:03.020 --> 30:05.122
I have all of you now.

30:05.187 --> 30:07.590
Wait! I don't see Batman.

30:07.657 --> 30:08.591
He's gone!

30:08.658 --> 30:10.826
Go, my monsters.

30:10.894 --> 30:14.463
Find the Batman
and bring him to me.

30:14.530 --> 30:17.566
And now, Junior Justice League,

30:17.633 --> 30:20.202
are you ready to do my bidding?

30:20.269 --> 30:25.741
Well, as Pa used to say,
"Does a cow moo when you pull its udder?"

30:26.877 --> 30:28.811
What?

30:28.879 --> 30:30.981
I'll assume
that's a yes,

30:31.048 --> 30:37.386
so welcome to
the Monster Society of Evil!

30:56.238 --> 30:59.176
There.

30:59.241 --> 31:01.510
There is the false Bat.

31:01.577 --> 31:03.947
Get him for the master.

31:14.690 --> 31:16.093
Uh-oh.

31:21.731 --> 31:22.933
Ha-ha!

31:26.235 --> 31:28.671
Got you.

31:28.738 --> 31:32.541
Come out, Batsy.
There is no place to go.

31:33.709 --> 31:35.045
Huh?

31:35.112 --> 31:37.379
Ha! Got you, got you.

31:37.446 --> 31:39.315
Now you're stuck in Bat Glue.

31:48.691 --> 31:51.393
No place to go, Batman?

31:51.460 --> 31:54.663
Or should I say "Batboy"?

32:07.944 --> 32:09.478
Are you okay, kid?

32:09.545 --> 32:11.214
I saw those bad guys and
thought you might need some help.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.616
- I...
- I mean, I appreciate the amount of work

32:13.682 --> 32:15.284
you put into your cosplay,

32:15.351 --> 32:17.586
but superhero-ing
is kind of dangerous.

32:17.653 --> 32:19.722
- I...
- How about I drop you off to your mom?

32:19.789 --> 32:23.759
Maybe she'll take you out for a milkshake
or something. Those always cheer me up.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.999
I am Batman.

32:29.832 --> 32:31.567
Sheesh.

32:31.634 --> 32:33.569
Mr. Mind transformed us
into children

32:33.636 --> 32:36.438
in order to control our young
impressionable minds.

32:36.505 --> 32:40.609
But because I'm awesome, I was able to
get away before his powers affected me.

32:40.676 --> 32:43.412
- Wow, you really are Batman.
- Duh.

32:43.479 --> 32:45.581
I guess that's a no
on super-hearing.

32:45.648 --> 32:47.583
Okay, okay. Digesting.

32:47.650 --> 32:49.718
Well, listen, Batman,

32:49.785 --> 32:52.321
how about you stay here
while I take care of...

32:52.388 --> 32:54.390
No. Mr. Mind controls
the monsters

32:54.456 --> 32:56.625
and the preadolescent
Justice League.

32:56.692 --> 32:58.828
There's a chance
he can get you, too.

32:58.895 --> 33:01.497
I don't want you jumping in
there and causing more trouble.

33:01.564 --> 33:03.399
- But I can help.
- Yeah.

33:03.465 --> 33:05.202
I don't work with people
I can't trust.

33:05.268 --> 33:08.004
And after your quick exit
at the Hall of Justice,

33:08.071 --> 33:10.506
I can't trust you.

33:10.573 --> 33:13.342
- What are you gonna do, then?
- It doesn't matter what I'm going to do.

33:13.409 --> 33:14.777
I'm Batman...

33:14.844 --> 33:17.346
...and everything I do
is incredible.

33:18.581 --> 33:22.919
The Batmobile.

33:22.986 --> 33:24.855
My diary is never
gonna believe this.

33:24.921 --> 33:28.024
Well, okay.
Good luck, Batman.

33:28.091 --> 33:30.593
I know there's no obstacle you can't overcome.

33:30.659 --> 33:32.329
- I have complete faith in you.
- Come on.

33:32.394 --> 33:33.395
You're a real hero.

33:33.462 --> 33:34.396
Change of plan.

33:34.463 --> 33:35.999
Do you really wanna help?

33:36.066 --> 33:37.733
Uh-huh.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.737
In my youthful state,
I'm unable to reach the pedals.

33:41.804 --> 33:44.975
- So, you'll need to drive.
- Drive?

33:45.041 --> 33:47.543
You can drive a stick,
can't you?

33:49.212 --> 33:51.114
Okay, no...

33:51.181 --> 33:53.816
Stop. Wait, no. Not that way.

33:53.884 --> 33:55.784
I thought you said you'd done this.

33:55.852 --> 33:58.889
Of course I have.
I'm an adult.

33:58.955 --> 34:01.157
Just a little rusty. Oh!

34:01.224 --> 34:04.027
Rusty? And why are you in third gear?

34:04.094 --> 34:08.064
Okay, let's just
stay off the freeway.

34:11.001 --> 34:13.602
Hello! Welcome!

34:13.669 --> 34:15.638
Have a great day.

34:16.739 --> 34:18.841
Well, what do we have here?

34:18.909 --> 34:23.113
It's not even Halloween
but, my, you look wonderful.

34:23.179 --> 34:25.315
What brings you in today?

34:25.382 --> 34:29.718
The master needs food
like a pig needs a pile of mud.

34:29.785 --> 34:33.522
Ooh, isn't that nice?

34:38.061 --> 34:41.097
Brick O's! My favorite!

34:42.399 --> 34:44.935
Looks like I have the last one.

34:45.001 --> 34:46.970
- I'll take that. Thanks.
- Huh?

34:54.978 --> 34:57.280
- It looks like it's ripe...
- Huh?

34:57.347 --> 34:58.614
...for the picking.

35:04.287 --> 35:08.158
Look what I found. Guess who's
going to be master's favorite now?

35:08.224 --> 35:12.262
As my ma used to say,
"You can't win a pig kissing contest

35:12.329 --> 35:13.796
without getting
a little dirty."

35:13.863 --> 35:15.731
That doesn't
even make sense.

35:15.798 --> 35:17.200
- Does, too.
- Does not.

35:17.267 --> 35:19.668
- Does, too.
- Does not, infinity plus one!

35:21.438 --> 35:23.472
Ow!

35:23.539 --> 35:25.875
I'm telling the master.

35:30.612 --> 35:33.016
Have a nice day.

35:38.721 --> 35:41.124
Mmm.

35:41.191 --> 35:43.226
Ugh. Gross.

35:43.293 --> 35:46.762
Oh, good. Mmm, you're back.
Just place the food anywhere.

35:46.829 --> 35:49.698
Mmm, I'll get to it eventually.

35:49.765 --> 35:54.437
I know it's me saying this but
shouldn't you, I don't know, slow down?

35:54.503 --> 35:57.840
<i>Eat more faster.</i>

35:57.907 --> 35:59.742
Slow down? No.

35:59.808 --> 36:02.611
If anything, I need to...
speed up.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.514
Mmm.

36:05.581 --> 36:09.252
Peas? What are peas
doing here?

36:09.319 --> 36:10.619
What's the rule?

36:10.686 --> 36:12.889
No peas, please.

36:12.956 --> 36:15.657
Exactly.
Anything else is fine.

36:15.724 --> 36:18.261
Broccoli, arugula, whatever,
just no peas.

36:18.328 --> 36:20.397
Sheesh. Now go!

36:20.463 --> 36:23.400
Give me more.
I must have more!

36:23.466 --> 36:26.202
Oh!

36:40.716 --> 36:42.618
Whoa. Wow!

36:42.684 --> 36:45.121
This place is amazing!

36:45.188 --> 36:48.557
I thought the Rock of Eternity
was cool, but this place...

36:48.624 --> 36:51.127
Rock of Eternity?

36:51.194 --> 36:53.695
Nexus of magic
in another dimension.

36:53.762 --> 36:55.564
Uh, it's a long story.

36:55.631 --> 36:57.400
What are you doing?

36:57.467 --> 36:59.969
My Bat Computer is the most
sophisticated computer on the planet.

37:00.036 --> 37:02.704
High-def with over
a billion mega-brixels,

37:02.771 --> 37:03.739
state of the art.

37:03.806 --> 37:05.475
It also streams Brickflix.

37:05.542 --> 37:10.646
And it has the ability to find
anyone at anytime in the world.

37:10.712 --> 37:12.982
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Way cool.

37:13.049 --> 37:14.050
There.

37:23.126 --> 37:25.794
They're stealing food from
everywhere. We have to stop them!

37:25.862 --> 37:27.564
I have to stop them.

37:27.629 --> 37:30.599
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't trust me. But,
I mean, come on.

37:30.666 --> 37:33.769
I helped you with the monsters,
the Batmobile... sort of.

37:33.836 --> 37:37.440
I know it's hard to believe,
but I don't trust people very easily.

37:37.507 --> 37:40.809
No, that's not hard to believe
at all. You live in a cave.

37:40.877 --> 37:42.678
In our line of work,
we have to be careful.

37:42.744 --> 37:44.780
I mean, what if
you were a bad guy?

37:44.847 --> 37:47.183
I've already revealed
too much to you.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.718
You're lucky I don't
take you out right now.

37:49.785 --> 37:51.888
I could, you know?
'Cause I'm Batman.

37:51.955 --> 37:54.723
And Batman is totally
the best hero.

37:55.191 --> 37:56.993
O... kay?

37:57.060 --> 37:59.828
Point is, it pays
to keep people at a distance.

37:59.896 --> 38:01.730
- So you...
- Never get hurt.

38:01.797 --> 38:05.368
Hemingway once said,

38:05.435 --> 38:08.737
"The best way to find out
if you can trust someone

38:08.804 --> 38:10.240
is to trust them."

38:10.806 --> 38:12.808
Fine. Shazam!

38:20.383 --> 38:23.719
- Billy Batson.
- Hey.

38:23.785 --> 38:26.556
I don't understand.
How did you...

38:26.623 --> 38:30.160
It all started when I helped you
during that Two-Face situation.

38:35.664 --> 38:39.068
Oh, no. Which one?
Which one?

38:39.135 --> 38:42.438
<i>The red wire, Billy.</i>

38:42.505 --> 38:44.407
<i>I don't know who
the voice belonged to.</i>

38:44.474 --> 38:46.409
<i>I just knew it saved our lives.</i>

38:48.011 --> 38:49.946
<i>After that, I went about
my usual routine.</i>

38:50.013 --> 38:54.017
Well, Billy, that's the last of the
money you got from recycling.

38:54.083 --> 38:56.818
Hope this sandwich is worth it
'cause I'm starving.

38:58.922 --> 39:00.290
Spare some food.

39:07.796 --> 39:09.265
Have a great day.

39:12.368 --> 39:15.572
You're a nice boy,
Billy Batson.

39:15.638 --> 39:17.307
Hey, how do you know my name?

39:20.009 --> 39:24.080
<i>That wasn't the only weird thing that
happened to me over the next couple of days.</i>

39:24.147 --> 39:26.449
Excuse me, ma'am,
let me give you a hand.

39:28.084 --> 39:31.154
You're
a nice boy, Billy Batson.

39:34.691 --> 39:37.493
<i>I just kept running
into the strangest people.</i>

39:40.029 --> 39:42.599
Hey, mister, you dropped this.

39:42.665 --> 39:45.535
- Huh?
- You're a nice boy.

39:45.602 --> 39:47.070
Here. For your trouble.

39:47.136 --> 39:50.340
Free subway token?
Thanks, mister.

39:53.376 --> 39:55.878
<i>Little did I know
that small token</i>

39:55.945 --> 39:58.681
<i>would lead me
on an incredible journey.</i>

39:58.747 --> 40:04.354
<i>Billy Batson, you have
been found... worthy.</i>

40:04.420 --> 40:06.356
That voice.

40:13.296 --> 40:18.268
<i>Climb aboard for
the adventure of a lifetime.</i>

40:27.277 --> 40:29.178
What is this place?

40:31.714 --> 40:35.418
"The seven deadly enemies
of man."

40:35.485 --> 40:38.054
Whoa, what a scary bunch.

40:38.121 --> 40:40.423
Billy Batson!

40:42.725 --> 40:44.826
I've been expecting you.

40:44.894 --> 40:47.196
You? That old man
I gave the food to.

40:47.263 --> 40:49.098
That woman I helped
to cross the street.

40:49.165 --> 40:50.867
And that guy I returned
his money to.

40:50.933 --> 40:52.935
- They were all you.
- Yes.

40:53.002 --> 40:55.804
I did that to test you, Billy.

40:55.872 --> 40:57.806
Test me? Test me for what?

40:57.874 --> 41:01.010
To see if you're worthy
of great power.

41:01.077 --> 41:02.844
And you are, Billy.

41:02.912 --> 41:05.814
Never have I seen
a heart so pure.

41:05.882 --> 41:08.284
The world is a dangerous place.

41:08.351 --> 41:11.820
It needs heroes.
Heroes like you.

41:11.888 --> 41:14.691
All you need to do
is say my name.

41:14.757 --> 41:15.925
Your name?

41:15.992 --> 41:17.493
Shazam!

41:18.027 --> 41:20.063
Sha... zam?

41:20.129 --> 41:23.466
No, no, no.
You can't just say it timidly.

41:23.533 --> 41:27.036
Otherwise, how would you
ever introduce yourself to people?

41:27.103 --> 41:29.906
That'd be ridiculous.

41:29.972 --> 41:33.242
Say it with meaning,
with purpose.

41:33.309 --> 41:35.111
Shazam!

41:38.715 --> 41:41.317
<i>After getting the power
of Shazam, I went to work,</i>

41:41.384 --> 41:43.686
<i>helping the city
as best I could.</i>

41:43.753 --> 41:45.154
<i>It was awesome.</i>

41:45.221 --> 41:47.357
<i>Not just because I had
these incredible powers</i>

41:47.423 --> 41:49.292
<i>but, you know,</i>

41:49.359 --> 41:51.060
<i>because I was a grownup.</i>

41:51.127 --> 41:53.996
Sorry, kid.
Maybe next time.

41:54.497 --> 41:55.164
Next.

41:57.300 --> 41:59.535
- Whoa!
- One, please.

42:04.207 --> 42:06.542
<i>But even with
all that power,</i>

42:07.377 --> 42:09.679
<i>it didn't really matter.</i>

42:09.746 --> 42:10.980
<i>I just wanted to belong.</i>

42:12.181 --> 42:13.883
<i>To not be alone.</i>

42:15.385 --> 42:18.654
You wouldn't understand.
You're the Batman.

42:18.721 --> 42:20.356
You've got friends, a family.

42:20.890 --> 42:22.658
But being a kid,

42:22.725 --> 42:24.460
an orphan,

42:24.527 --> 42:25.863
it's the worst.

42:25.928 --> 42:28.398
I totally understand if you
don't want to work with me,

42:28.464 --> 42:29.932
now that you know.

42:42.044 --> 42:43.646
Uh... I'm sorry.

42:43.713 --> 42:46.884
I know this is supposed to be,
like, an important moment,

42:46.949 --> 42:48.684
but I don't really
recognize you.

42:50.686 --> 42:51.988
Maybe in your adult form?

42:52.054 --> 42:55.057
I'm Bruce Wayne.

42:55.124 --> 42:57.827
Bruce Wayne?

42:57.895 --> 43:00.163
Like, <i>the</i> Bruce Wayne?

43:00.229 --> 43:01.899
Billionaire Bruce Wayne?

43:01.964 --> 43:04.534
The Bruce Wayne with all those
super expensive sports cars?

43:04.600 --> 43:08.304
The Bruce Wayne with the private
jet that has its own arcade in it?

43:08.371 --> 43:11.007
Holy moly! What's that like?

43:11.073 --> 43:13.342
It's okay. I mean,
I only have, like,

43:13.409 --> 43:15.711
500 games onboard.
No big whoop.

43:15.778 --> 43:17.580
Awesome!

43:17.647 --> 43:19.348
Listen, Billy,

43:19.415 --> 43:22.853
when I was a kid about your age,
I lost my parents, too.

43:22.920 --> 43:24.922
So I know what it is
to be alone.

43:24.987 --> 43:28.291
I took that fear and loneliness and
decided to do something good with it.

43:28.357 --> 43:29.927
Just like you're doing.

43:29.992 --> 43:33.229
Be proud of who you are, Billy.
Kids can be heroes too.

43:33.296 --> 43:36.032
My three former Robins
are a testament to that.

43:36.098 --> 43:38.768
What you did? That's brave.

43:38.835 --> 43:40.570
Showing me really who you are?

43:41.571 --> 43:43.306
That's trust.

43:43.372 --> 43:47.577
I don't know what the others would say,
but you're all right with me.

43:47.643 --> 43:49.412
Now, back to business.

43:49.479 --> 43:52.815
We have to figure out why the
Justice League is gathering all that food,

43:52.883 --> 43:55.953
and how to stop that telepathic tyrant,
Mr. Mind.

43:56.018 --> 43:58.889
Speaking of food, I'm starving.

43:58.956 --> 44:00.089
Ooh, me too.

44:00.156 --> 44:01.624
Hey, wanna see something cool?

44:01.691 --> 44:04.093
Alfred, can I get two glasses
of milk and cookies?

44:04.160 --> 44:05.661
And not the oatmeal kind.

44:05.728 --> 44:08.698
Maybe... Ooh, something
with chocolate chips in it?

44:08.764 --> 44:10.600
As you wish, Master Damian.

44:10.666 --> 44:13.135
Uh, Damian? I'm...
Oh, oh, yes.

44:13.202 --> 44:15.371
- Faster, old man.
- Old man...

44:15.438 --> 44:17.840
- You have your own butler?
- Not bad, right?

44:17.908 --> 44:19.609
He'll make me whatever I want.

44:19.675 --> 44:22.612
Unless I make him mad,
which happens more than...

44:22.678 --> 44:24.547
Wait a minute. That's it!

44:27.683 --> 44:29.652
Mr. Mind said that
in order to control us,

44:29.719 --> 44:32.522
he had to make sure our minds
were young and impressionable.

44:32.588 --> 44:34.457
But that also means
he has limits.

44:34.524 --> 44:36.626
And if I'm right,
which I always am,

44:36.692 --> 44:38.728
the more active the brains
of our friends are,

44:38.794 --> 44:41.230
the more difficult they are
to control.

44:41.297 --> 44:43.432
So we have to make them
angry or stressed.

44:43.499 --> 44:46.068
- And that will break his hold on them.
- Exactly.

44:46.135 --> 44:50.974
Once the hold is broken, we toss one of
these disrupters onto them, and presto!

44:51.073 --> 44:53.376
No more mind control.

44:53.442 --> 44:55.344
- Got it.
- And, Shazam?

44:56.980 --> 44:58.214
Good luck.

45:05.555 --> 45:07.958
The most powerful ring
in the galaxy,

45:08.025 --> 45:12.662
and here I am trolling
the ocean for stinky fish?

45:12.728 --> 45:13.596
Ugh.

45:13.663 --> 45:16.867
Say,
that ring is pretty cool.

45:16.934 --> 45:21.170
Oh, hey. Yeah. It can
make anything I can think of.

45:21.237 --> 45:22.638
- Really?
- Really.

45:22.705 --> 45:25.541
Even... I don't know,
a boat?

45:25.608 --> 45:26.776
Please.

45:28.344 --> 45:30.246
Wow. What about a whale?

45:30.313 --> 45:31.647
Like I told you,

45:32.181 --> 45:33.849
anything.

45:33.917 --> 45:35.117
Not bad.

45:35.184 --> 45:37.753
So you can make anything?
A jet?

45:38.989 --> 45:40.323
Two jets?

45:42.725 --> 45:44.861
What about a dog piloting
a jet while drinking a shake

45:44.928 --> 45:48.297
and wearing sunglasses
while wearing a large hat?

45:48.364 --> 45:49.799
And barking out the ABCs.

45:49.866 --> 45:51.567
Yeah. All right.

45:51.634 --> 45:53.836
Oh, also a knight
in shining armor

45:53.904 --> 45:57.139
with a sword, riding a bicycle,
handcuffed to a T-Rex,

45:57.206 --> 45:58.541
- standing behind a pony...
- Slow down.

45:58.608 --> 46:00.242
...on top
of an armored car.

46:00.309 --> 46:02.045
Oh, and can you get
a sports car in there, too?

46:02.111 --> 46:06.382
Anything... else?

46:06.449 --> 46:08.517
Just this.

46:13.090 --> 46:14.323
One down.

46:24.233 --> 46:26.335
Mmm, prime rib.

46:26.402 --> 46:28.204
Mr. Mind is totes
gonna love this.

46:28.270 --> 46:32.708
Ah, Wonder Woman, I see you're
still flying that invisible clunker.

46:32.775 --> 46:35.378
Clunker? Why, you...

46:35.444 --> 46:37.380
My mom gave me this jet!

46:37.446 --> 46:40.149
It can run circles
around your rodent mobile!

46:40.216 --> 46:43.020
No. No, it can't.

46:43.086 --> 46:45.022
- Can, too.
- Cannot.

46:45.088 --> 46:46.890
- Can, too.
- Cannot.

46:46.957 --> 46:49.158
- Can, too!
- Prove it, then.

46:49.225 --> 46:51.128
First one to the end
of the canyon wins.

46:51.193 --> 46:52.361
You're on!

47:22.792 --> 47:25.828
Looks like there's room
for only one of us, hotshot.

47:28.999 --> 47:30.700
Ha! That did it.

47:31.968 --> 47:32.835
Huh?

47:36.305 --> 47:37.874
No way!

47:37.941 --> 47:41.777
I totally would have won if I'd
had a more aerodynamic cow.

47:41.844 --> 47:43.612
You never did like to lose.

47:43.679 --> 47:46.149
Argh! Just wait
till I get my hands on you.

47:46.215 --> 47:49.953
Now, now, Wonder Woman,
no one likes a sore loser.

47:53.622 --> 47:54.724
Two down.

48:04.467 --> 48:05.835
Whoo-hoo!
Pardon me.

48:05.902 --> 48:07.403
Flash coming through.

48:13.076 --> 48:16.079
Wow. That's quite
a pile of food you have there.

48:16.146 --> 48:18.748
- Yeah, so?
- Well, I mean, uh,

48:18.814 --> 48:21.450
how are you gonna get it
all to your master?

48:21.517 --> 48:23.686
I'll just run it over
to him, duh.

48:23.753 --> 48:26.022
Oh, just, uh,
one by one, then?

48:26.089 --> 48:27.224
Mm-hm.

48:27.289 --> 48:28.557
Huh.

48:28.624 --> 48:30.559
I just thought
because you're so fast,

48:30.626 --> 48:34.497
you could do something a bit,
I don't know, flashier?

48:34.563 --> 48:37.700
- Hey, I can be flashy.
- Oh, I'm sure you can.

48:37.767 --> 48:41.403
Superman said he could do it faster, but,
I mean, you know, what does he know, right?

48:41.470 --> 48:42.873
Superman said that?

48:42.939 --> 48:46.176
Ooh. After all the times
I beat him in a race...

48:46.243 --> 48:47.777
Whatevs. I'll show him.

48:47.843 --> 48:50.813
- You better step back.
- Oh. Sure.

48:55.751 --> 48:59.122
Ha-ha! See? Nothing to it.

48:59.189 --> 49:00.257
Hmm.

49:00.322 --> 49:02.391
Is that the best you can do?

49:02.458 --> 49:03.860
No.

49:03.927 --> 49:05.694
Watch this.

49:17.573 --> 49:19.675
Where am I?

49:30.786 --> 49:32.521
Mmm, nice.

49:35.424 --> 49:38.195
Master's gonna love
this Kent Farm's corn.

49:38.261 --> 49:40.529
Superman, save me.

49:42.331 --> 49:43.599
Oh, hi, Clark.

49:43.666 --> 49:46.535
Well, I'll be a tadpole
on a lily pad.

49:46.602 --> 49:48.171
What are you doing here?

49:48.238 --> 49:49.605
I've come to help you.

49:49.672 --> 49:52.108
Help me? I'm Superman.

49:52.175 --> 49:54.410
You're the one
that's gonna need help.

50:01.717 --> 50:03.586
Somebody needs a nap.

50:08.892 --> 50:11.827
You know
I have X-ray vision, right?

50:16.299 --> 50:18.534
Who's the hide-and-seek
champ now?

50:19.269 --> 50:21.071
More like chump.

50:24.875 --> 50:26.609
A Boy Scout like you
is no real threat

50:26.675 --> 50:29.478
to an awesome superhero
like Batman.

50:30.746 --> 50:33.083
I hear a lot
of gums flappin'...

50:35.417 --> 50:37.153
but not a lot of wind.

50:38.687 --> 50:40.589
You may have muscles, Clarky,

50:40.656 --> 50:43.659
but when it comes to
strategy or planning, you...

50:46.528 --> 50:48.564
You're just lucky
I'm pulling my punches.

50:48.631 --> 50:51.734
Ooh,
I'm shaking in my Bat Boots.

50:51.800 --> 50:54.070
You're not even wearing
any boots.

50:58.807 --> 51:01.644
Ah!

51:01.710 --> 51:03.980
You got any more insults
now, dingbat?

51:04.047 --> 51:05.315
Just one.

51:05.382 --> 51:07.884
I liked you better when
you wore your underwear...

51:07.951 --> 51:09.618
on the outside.

51:09.685 --> 51:12.122
Huh?

51:17.793 --> 51:18.594
Oh, boy.

51:21.630 --> 51:24.134
I'm glad to see everyone
back to normal.

51:25.201 --> 51:27.037
Well, relatively.

51:29.005 --> 51:30.539
Can we, like,
get this over with

51:30.606 --> 51:32.608
so I go back to being an adult?

51:32.675 --> 51:34.277
Being a kid is the worst.

51:34.344 --> 51:37.646
Huh. I haven't really noticed
a difference at all.

51:37.713 --> 51:40.283
That's because you've always
been a kid.

51:40.350 --> 51:43.519
But I'm dying. The mood swings,
the hunger pains.

51:43.585 --> 51:45.587
How can you even
trust kids at all?

51:45.654 --> 51:47.723
All these hormones,
no life experience.

51:47.790 --> 51:49.825
I feel like I'm going to cry
at any given moment.

51:49.893 --> 51:52.362
Hey, being a kid
isn't that bad.

51:52.429 --> 51:54.630
Kids, back to business.

51:54.697 --> 51:56.632
What we know,

51:56.699 --> 52:00.536
Mr. Mind has been hoarding a massive
amount of food here at this warehouse.

52:00.602 --> 52:04.740
The League will take myself and Shazam as
pretend prisoners in order to get into the base.

52:04.807 --> 52:07.743
Once we are in his inner sanctum,
we'll use these mental dampeners

52:07.810 --> 52:09.446
to protect us from
Mr. Mind's control,

52:09.511 --> 52:13.450
and stop this Monster
Society of Evil once and for all.

52:20.290 --> 52:22.158
That door does open, you know.

52:22.225 --> 52:23.460
No food?

52:23.525 --> 52:25.627
Why did you come back
empty-handed?

52:25.694 --> 52:28.697
We brought something better
than food, Jeepers.

52:28.764 --> 52:31.167
We brought prisoners.

52:34.371 --> 52:36.605
That's right. Batman is here.

52:36.672 --> 52:39.775
You better take me
to Mr. Mind right now.

52:39.842 --> 52:42.711
Please.
We don't take orders from you.

52:42.778 --> 52:44.414
No one can see the master
right now.

52:44.481 --> 52:47.516
Children, leave the prisoners
and continue gathering food.

52:48.418 --> 52:51.321
Uh, Batman, what's plan B?

52:51.388 --> 52:53.589
Well, what are you waiting for?

52:54.057 --> 52:55.624
Batman?

52:55.691 --> 52:58.594
Uh, sorry. At this age,
I wasn't all that good at thinking ahead.

52:59.996 --> 53:01.730
Creatures, get them!

53:01.797 --> 53:03.732
Jig's up. Attack, now!

53:06.568 --> 53:08.104
Excuse me.

53:10.572 --> 53:11.941
For a doll,

53:12.008 --> 53:13.675
why'd you have to be
such a...

53:13.742 --> 53:15.945
you know, Dummy?

53:19.516 --> 53:21.951
Let go, imposter!

53:22.018 --> 53:25.288
Imposter?
I called this name first.

53:35.865 --> 53:38.535
Kryptonian, I've defeated
your kind before.

53:38.600 --> 53:40.569
You're no match for Oom.

53:48.912 --> 53:51.381
This would be beneath
adult Superman.

53:51.448 --> 53:53.682
Me? Not so much.

53:57.420 --> 53:59.755
Come on, it's not funny.

53:59.822 --> 54:02.525
I didn't want to leave
the swamp, you know?

54:02.591 --> 54:04.894
But he didn't care.

54:04.961 --> 54:07.030
No one understands me.

54:13.702 --> 54:15.071
It's over, Sivana.

54:17.440 --> 54:18.942
I hope so.

54:19.008 --> 54:21.978
I'm tired of being
mind-controlled. We all are.

54:22.045 --> 54:25.814
All I want to do is go home and work
on my own plans for world domination.

54:25.882 --> 54:28.418
Great! I mean, good.

54:28.485 --> 54:29.919
Not good. It's...

54:29.986 --> 54:32.688
It's good that you wanna stop,
but not...

54:32.754 --> 54:35.859
- Where is Mr. Mind?
- He's there.

54:39.062 --> 54:40.762
What do you think
we'll find in there?

54:40.829 --> 54:43.799
Whatever it is,
we'll face it together.

54:45.634 --> 54:47.703
By Hades' heatstroke,

54:47.769 --> 54:49.472
what is that?

54:49.539 --> 54:52.342
It appears to be
some sort of chry-sal-lis.

54:52.408 --> 54:55.612
Everyone knows
it's pronounced chrysalis.

54:55.677 --> 54:57.313
Can we just call it a cocoon?

54:57.380 --> 54:59.883
Well, whatever we're
calling it, what's it for?

54:59.949 --> 55:02.185
For Mr. Mind.

55:02.252 --> 55:04.954
Uh, guys, I think
we need to get out of here.

55:07.190 --> 55:08.057
Now!

55:08.124 --> 55:09.092
Seconded.

55:39.721 --> 55:42.724
We're gonna need
some serious moth balls.

55:42.791 --> 55:46.629
We can do this, team.
Let's get him.

55:49.499 --> 55:50.533
Fools!

55:50.600 --> 55:52.569
You have served your purpose.

55:52.635 --> 55:57.507
You gathered the sustenance I
needed to complete my transformation.

55:57.574 --> 55:59.342
Now nothing on Earth

55:59.409 --> 56:04.746
can stop me from ruling
over you small-minded mortals.

56:05.381 --> 56:06.416
Nothing on Earth?

56:06.482 --> 56:07.749
That's it.

56:07.816 --> 56:09.052
Follow me!

56:15.757 --> 56:20.396
You won't get away
from me that easily, Junior League.

56:20.463 --> 56:23.333
Whatever it is you're hoping
to do, Shazam, do it fast.

56:29.973 --> 56:31.407
<i>Follow them.</i>

56:31.474 --> 56:32.642
<i>Follow them.</i>

56:37.247 --> 56:39.048
He's coming!

56:39.115 --> 56:39.916
Hold on!

56:46.055 --> 56:48.491
Oh, this ride better end quick.

56:56.666 --> 56:58.468
Is this supposed to slow down?

56:58.534 --> 57:00.169
Uh, yeah?

57:07.343 --> 57:09.811
The Wizard who gave me
my powers lives here.

57:09.879 --> 57:11.481
He'll know what to do.
Come on.

57:14.517 --> 57:16.386
<i>Do you see</i>

57:16.452 --> 57:18.855
<i>the power of eternity?</i>

57:18.921 --> 57:22.458
Yes. The power,
I must have it.

57:30.733 --> 57:32.869
Wizard. Wizard!

57:32.935 --> 57:34.937
What? Huh?

57:35.672 --> 57:36.906
Oh, Billy!

57:36.973 --> 57:38.341
It's good to see you.

57:38.408 --> 57:40.476
- "Billy"?
- Uh...

57:40.543 --> 57:42.378
I said...

57:42.445 --> 57:44.947
"Silly." Silly Shazam.

57:45.014 --> 57:46.848
So good of you to come.

57:46.916 --> 57:48.384
And you brought
some young friends

57:48.451 --> 57:50.953
to trick or treat
at the Rock of Eternity.

57:51.020 --> 57:53.623
Lovely costumes.

57:53.690 --> 57:56.793
The star on that tiara
really draws your eyes

57:56.859 --> 57:58.661
away from your face.

57:58.728 --> 58:00.063
Told you guys.

58:00.129 --> 58:02.198
I think I have some candy corn
in the back.

58:02.265 --> 58:04.367
- Wizard...
- Mm, but that was 100 years ago.

58:04.434 --> 58:05.635
Uh, Wizard?

58:05.702 --> 58:07.203
Does candy corn go bad?

58:07.270 --> 58:10.573
Ugh. No. Wizard,
this is the Justice League.

58:10.640 --> 58:13.209
They've been transformed
by a malevolent worm

58:13.276 --> 58:15.445
that just transformed
into a giant moth

58:15.511 --> 58:18.481
who is floating around outside
waiting to destroy us!

58:18.548 --> 58:21.417
A giant moth?

58:21.484 --> 58:23.920
I... hate... moths.

58:29.359 --> 58:32.095
This building, it tastes...

58:32.161 --> 58:35.398
It tastes like eternity.

58:36.366 --> 58:39.669
<i>Yes. More. More!</i>

58:39.736 --> 58:40.703
The power,

58:40.770 --> 58:42.572
it's intoxicating!

58:50.146 --> 58:52.281
What is happening?

58:53.851 --> 58:57.687
That giant moth is
feeding off the Rock of Eternity.

58:57.754 --> 59:01.457
This place is the nexus
of limitless magical power!

59:01.524 --> 59:05.495
If he eats much more,
he may be unstoppable.

59:06.162 --> 59:08.131
Not to mention...

59:08.866 --> 59:10.666
Oh, no!

59:10.733 --> 59:12.435
What is it?

59:12.502 --> 59:15.138
Hurry! The more
the rock is destroyed,

59:15.204 --> 59:17.875
the more it weakens
the defenses of the building.

59:21.511 --> 59:22.512
Shazam,

59:22.578 --> 59:24.547
if what is inside
this prison is released,

59:24.614 --> 59:28.184
an unspeakable terror
will be unleashed upon us all.

59:28.251 --> 59:30.253
You must use the power of Zeus,

59:30.319 --> 59:33.189
and together,
you can defeat this evil.

59:33.857 --> 59:35.324
The power of Zeus?

59:35.391 --> 59:36.894
But I don't know what that is!

59:36.959 --> 59:40.997
You must completely trust them.

59:41.063 --> 59:44.902
You have to be willing to let
them see you as you really are.

59:44.967 --> 59:46.269
Yes. Yes, that's great.

59:46.335 --> 59:48.137
But can you just
be more specific...

59:51.040 --> 59:56.012
Free! Free!

59:56.078 --> 59:59.649
By Poseidon's pits,
who is that?

59:59.715 --> 1:00:02.920
I am Black Adam.

1:00:02.985 --> 1:00:05.988
Earth's mightiest mortal.

1:00:06.589 --> 1:00:08.324
Holy moly.

1:00:08.391 --> 1:00:10.726
The power of eternity,

1:00:10.793 --> 1:00:12.728
it is mine!

1:00:17.366 --> 1:00:18.534
Ah.

1:00:18.601 --> 1:00:21.103
My unwitting pawn.

1:00:21.170 --> 1:00:23.005
You? The voice.

1:00:23.072 --> 1:00:24.942
The voice inside my head.

1:00:25.007 --> 1:00:26.409
But how?

1:00:26.476 --> 1:00:30.279
Centuries of isolation
strengthens the mind.

1:00:30.346 --> 1:00:33.115
I just needed
to harness my powers,

1:00:33.182 --> 1:00:36.018
and use the Rock of Eternity
as an antenna

1:00:36.085 --> 1:00:37.955
to find a weak-minded being

1:00:38.020 --> 1:00:40.623
that would be open
to suggestion.

1:00:40.690 --> 1:00:41.925
Weak mind?

1:00:41.991 --> 1:00:43.759
I'm Mr. Mind.

1:00:43.826 --> 1:00:46.897
And now, I'm all-powerful.

1:00:49.298 --> 1:00:52.134
Let me show you power, worm!

1:01:00.743 --> 1:01:02.044
Shazam!

1:01:09.285 --> 1:01:10.586
Oh, dear.

1:01:10.653 --> 1:01:12.555
Oh, no.

1:01:12.622 --> 1:01:16.292
Oh, this doesn't look good
at all. Huh?

1:01:19.462 --> 1:01:20.663
Shazam!

1:01:24.634 --> 1:01:27.036
His costume,
he looks just like you.

1:01:27.103 --> 1:01:28.237
Who is he?

1:01:28.304 --> 1:01:30.306
The Wizard's first champion.

1:01:30.373 --> 1:01:33.877
Evidently, he went crazy
and took over the world.

1:01:33.944 --> 1:01:35.244
We're in trouble.

1:01:35.311 --> 1:01:37.079
Oh, must go faster.

1:01:37.146 --> 1:01:38.581
Must go... Oh!

1:01:39.815 --> 1:01:41.150
Hello.

1:01:41.217 --> 1:01:43.486
Perhaps we could come
to some sort of arrang...

1:01:48.791 --> 1:01:50.560
Heh.

1:01:56.033 --> 1:01:57.366
Wizard.

1:01:57.433 --> 1:02:00.670
It is time we finish this.

1:02:00.736 --> 1:02:04.140
If you want the Wizard,
you'll have to get through me!

1:02:04.206 --> 1:02:06.576
You'll have to get
through all of us.

1:02:09.312 --> 1:02:10.546
Sorry, kids,

1:02:10.613 --> 1:02:13.115
you need to be
this high to fight me.

1:02:13.182 --> 1:02:14.684
Aw, man!

1:02:14.750 --> 1:02:15.953
He's joking, Flash.

1:02:16.019 --> 1:02:17.186
Oh! I knew that.

1:02:17.253 --> 1:02:19.155
What I'm not joking about

1:02:19.221 --> 1:02:20.523
is your doom!

1:02:27.229 --> 1:02:29.032
Hyah!

1:02:29.098 --> 1:02:31.701
- Whoa! Hey, let go of me. I'm Batman.
- Hey, hands off!

1:02:31.767 --> 1:02:34.437
Yeah. Hey, not the cape. This is silly.

1:02:34.503 --> 1:02:36.472
Whoa!

1:02:37.206 --> 1:02:39.342
Leave my friends alone!

1:02:39.809 --> 1:02:41.377
You.

1:02:41.444 --> 1:02:45.514
So, the Wizard found
a new errand boy.

1:02:45.581 --> 1:02:48.584
Come. Come show me
what you have.

1:02:59.096 --> 1:03:02.732
You amateur,
you're making this too easy.

1:03:08.237 --> 1:03:09.805
Ha-ha.

1:03:10.907 --> 1:03:11.841
Pathetic.

1:03:15.311 --> 1:03:17.413
You're not capable
of wielding the power

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:19.482
that that suit represents.

1:03:20.783 --> 1:03:22.818
You're nothing but a boy.

1:03:33.262 --> 1:03:34.830
Say good night

1:03:35.531 --> 1:03:37.000
forever.

1:03:37.067 --> 1:03:38.367
Stop!

1:03:41.303 --> 1:03:44.240
This is between us, Adam.

1:03:44.306 --> 1:03:45.808
Leave the boy alone.

1:03:47.743 --> 1:03:48.744
Fine.

1:03:49.845 --> 1:03:52.214
Whoa!

1:04:12.969 --> 1:04:13.836
Got him.

1:04:16.205 --> 1:04:17.573
Thanks, Wonder Woman.

1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:20.342
All right, League,
it's time to stop this madman

1:04:20.409 --> 1:04:21.744
once and for all.

1:04:21.811 --> 1:04:24.447
But how?
He's more powerful than we are,

1:04:24.513 --> 1:04:25.949
especially as kids.

1:04:26.016 --> 1:04:27.249
We have to try.

1:04:27.316 --> 1:04:29.218
We can't leave the Wizard
to face him alone.

1:04:29.285 --> 1:04:31.554
Agreed! Come on, guys!

1:04:38.627 --> 1:04:41.230
It's some kind of energy field.

1:04:48.138 --> 1:04:49.338
Wizard!

1:04:49.405 --> 1:04:51.707
<i>Billy, you mustn't interfere.</i>

1:04:51.774 --> 1:04:55.078
<i>I will hold Black Adam off
as long as I can.</i>

1:04:55.145 --> 1:04:57.713
<i>I've created a portal
back to Earth.</i>

1:04:57.780 --> 1:04:59.281
<i>Go! Now!</i>

1:04:59.348 --> 1:05:00.683
I'm not leaving you.

1:05:00.750 --> 1:05:02.251
<i>Never mind about me.</i>

1:05:02.318 --> 1:05:03.819
<i>Black Adam is too dangerous</i>

1:05:03.887 --> 1:05:06.388
<i>for you and the others
to face right now.</i>

1:05:06.455 --> 1:05:07.924
But what about you?

1:05:07.991 --> 1:05:10.093
<i>You must go now.</i>

1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:11.560
<i>If I don't stop him,</i>

1:05:11.627 --> 1:05:14.396
<i>you will be
the last line of defense.</i>

1:05:14.463 --> 1:05:17.968
<i>Remember, the power of Zeus.</i>

1:05:21.872 --> 1:05:23.173
Wizard!

1:05:25.708 --> 1:05:28.844
Your time
is finally up, Wizard.

1:05:34.316 --> 1:05:36.052
No!

1:05:46.428 --> 1:05:49.398
I'm coming for you, Shazam!

1:05:49.465 --> 1:05:50.967
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, no.

1:05:51.034 --> 1:05:53.569
I'm coming for all of you!

1:06:05.248 --> 1:06:06.682
Let's go home.

1:06:10.519 --> 1:06:13.023
I've got a plan.

1:06:13.089 --> 1:06:14.824
When I was first turned
into a child,

1:06:14.891 --> 1:06:16.492
I found our vehicles
were ineffective

1:06:16.559 --> 1:06:17.894
because of our height.

1:06:17.961 --> 1:06:21.797
In fact, Shazam had to drive
the Batmobile.

1:06:21.865 --> 1:06:24.234
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You got to drive the Batmobile?

1:06:24.301 --> 1:06:26.802
- Oh, sweet!
- Are you kidding me?

1:06:26.870 --> 1:06:28.637
Yeah, it's definitely
stick shift.

1:06:28.704 --> 1:06:31.274
For our
vehicles to be effective,

1:06:31.340 --> 1:06:33.609
they need to be our size.

1:06:33.676 --> 1:06:36.012
It's time to build
something new.

1:07:14.985 --> 1:07:18.154
Well,
butter my bricks and call me a biscuit!

1:07:18.221 --> 1:07:19.956
These look amazing!

1:07:21.324 --> 1:07:22.625
The trouble alert.

1:07:25.195 --> 1:07:26.662
Lois Lane reporting live

1:07:26.729 --> 1:07:28.697
from the League of Nations
building in Metropolis,

1:07:28.764 --> 1:07:31.667
where a man has appeared
floating down through the air.

1:07:31.734 --> 1:07:33.870
He is hovering
toward the main assembly now.

1:07:33.937 --> 1:07:35.872
Maybe there's
a new hero in town.

1:07:39.175 --> 1:07:40.243
No. Not a hero.

1:07:40.310 --> 1:07:41.443
Definitely not a hero.

1:07:43.679 --> 1:07:44.881
Black Adam is here.

1:07:44.948 --> 1:07:46.849
And I thought I was fast.
Sheesh.

1:07:46.917 --> 1:07:47.783
What now?

1:07:47.851 --> 1:07:50.452
Now we do
what we were born to do.

1:07:50.519 --> 1:07:52.155
We save the day.

1:07:56.825 --> 1:07:59.828
Nothing on Earth
can stop this party. Whoo!

1:08:06.568 --> 1:08:08.071
Bad feeling about this.

1:08:08.138 --> 1:08:10.073
Maybe he's here
to install the disco light.

1:08:10.140 --> 1:08:12.275
Excuse me. You can't
just barge in here

1:08:12.342 --> 1:08:13.742
and ruin our party...

1:08:15.644 --> 1:08:16.880
Party over.

1:08:16.947 --> 1:08:18.381
People of...

1:08:21.017 --> 1:08:22.185
Sorry.

1:08:22.252 --> 1:08:24.120
People of Earth,

1:08:24.187 --> 1:08:27.456
I, Black Adam,
am your rightful ruler.

1:08:27.523 --> 1:08:30.093
You will obey me
without question.

1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:32.828
Those who don't will be
crushed beneath my...

1:08:32.896 --> 1:08:34.197
Feet?

1:08:37.067 --> 1:08:38.168
What?

1:08:38.234 --> 1:08:39.635
Who dares?

1:08:39.702 --> 1:08:41.204
The Justice League,

1:08:41.271 --> 1:08:43.006
that's who!

1:08:50.813 --> 1:08:53.116
Execute plan Playtime.

1:08:54.250 --> 1:08:55.452
Foolish children.

1:08:55.517 --> 1:08:57.486
Your games won't stop me.

1:08:57.553 --> 1:09:00.056
You must think
you're pretty slick.

1:09:05.929 --> 1:09:06.595
What?

1:09:07.864 --> 1:09:09.299
Need help getting cleaned up?

1:09:09.366 --> 1:09:11.034
How about this spin cycle?

1:09:14.503 --> 1:09:15.472
Tag! You're it.

1:09:24.114 --> 1:09:25.048
Batter up!

1:09:33.156 --> 1:09:35.925
All right, Flash,
let's wrap this up.

1:09:38.228 --> 1:09:40.363
What kind of games
are these, children?

1:09:40.430 --> 1:09:42.232
The kind you'll lose.

1:09:42.298 --> 1:09:44.034
Now, Princess!

1:09:54.077 --> 1:09:55.677
Huh. Enough!

1:09:55.744 --> 1:09:57.080
Not quite.

1:09:57.147 --> 1:10:00.250
Every game should end
with a little fireworks.

1:10:04.686 --> 1:10:06.688
- Did we do it?
- We must have.

1:10:06.755 --> 1:10:08.925
He is flatter than a flapjack
on the griddle.

1:10:28.078 --> 1:10:29.745
Hah!

1:10:37.420 --> 1:10:38.720
Kneel before me.

1:10:38.787 --> 1:10:41.391
Kneel before
the great Black Adam.

1:10:41.458 --> 1:10:43.359
What?

1:10:43.426 --> 1:10:45.095
Say, leave the kid alone!

1:10:45.161 --> 1:10:46.996
You are a horrible human being.

1:10:47.063 --> 1:10:49.165
Pick on somebody your own size.

1:10:49.232 --> 1:10:50.266
Get out of here!

1:10:50.333 --> 1:10:51.534
Stop it!

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:53.269
- Leave us alone!
- I am Black Adam.

1:10:53.336 --> 1:10:54.537
We know.

1:10:54.603 --> 1:10:56.239
I am all-powerful!

1:10:56.306 --> 1:10:57.806
We know.

1:10:57.874 --> 1:11:00.210
We'd never bow
to the likes of you.

1:11:02.178 --> 1:11:05.048
Coward!

1:11:05.115 --> 1:11:07.851
What now? We need,
like, three more Shazams

1:11:07.917 --> 1:11:09.519
to even put a dent in that guy.

1:11:09.586 --> 1:11:10.652
Three more?

1:11:10.719 --> 1:11:12.088
Shazam!

1:11:14.790 --> 1:11:15.992
Shazam!

1:11:23.399 --> 1:11:26.536
<i>Remember, the power of Zeus.</i>

1:11:26.603 --> 1:11:27.971
The power of Zeus!

1:11:28.037 --> 1:11:30.739
Guys, I know what I have to do.

1:11:30.806 --> 1:11:33.209
But, to do it,

1:11:33.276 --> 1:11:35.612
I have to show you
who I really am.

1:11:35.677 --> 1:11:37.046
Remember, Shazam,

1:11:37.113 --> 1:11:39.949
the only way to trust someone
is to trust them.

1:11:41.918 --> 1:11:43.319
This might tickle.

1:11:44.220 --> 1:11:45.288
Shazam!

1:12:12.315 --> 1:12:13.917
This is amazing!

1:12:13.983 --> 1:12:16.052
We're adults again.

1:12:16.119 --> 1:12:17.153
I feel...

1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:19.889
More powerful
than a locomotive.

1:12:19.956 --> 1:12:21.823
Way more powerful.

1:12:21.891 --> 1:12:23.159
Hi.

1:12:24.460 --> 1:12:26.029
I'm Billy Batson.

1:12:26.728 --> 1:12:28.364
You're a...

1:12:28.431 --> 1:12:29.999
Kid.

1:12:30.066 --> 1:12:32.168
Now you know
why I didn't want to tell you.

1:12:32.235 --> 1:12:34.370
I didn't want you
to think less of me.

1:12:34.437 --> 1:12:37.140
Billy, being a hero
isn't about your age

1:12:37.207 --> 1:12:39.008
or having flashy superpowers.

1:12:39.075 --> 1:12:40.443
Part of being a hero

1:12:40.510 --> 1:12:42.711
is trying to make the world
a better place,

1:12:42.778 --> 1:12:44.147
no matter what age you are.

1:12:44.214 --> 1:12:47.083
Yeah. That
and an awesome costume.

1:12:47.150 --> 1:12:49.319
By the way,
why didn't my costume change?

1:12:49.385 --> 1:12:51.054
You've already got
a lightning bolt.

1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:54.290
Billy, you're going to make
one incredible member

1:12:54.357 --> 1:12:55.925
of the Justice League.

1:12:55.992 --> 1:12:58.861
Ha-ha!
Sentimental fools!

1:12:58.928 --> 1:13:00.897
Even by using
the power of Zeus,

1:13:00.964 --> 1:13:02.565
you will not defeat me.

1:13:02.632 --> 1:13:04.934
I am Black Adam!

1:13:05.001 --> 1:13:06.869
As my ma used to say,

1:13:06.936 --> 1:13:11.140
"There's nothing worse than a
rooster that hollers before sunrise."

1:13:22.518 --> 1:13:24.454
Well, Terrance,
your mother and I

1:13:24.520 --> 1:13:25.722
are both school teachers,

1:13:25.787 --> 1:13:27.557
so I hope you like
studying every day.

1:13:27.624 --> 1:13:31.327
Oh, and we almost never eat at
those fun fast-food burger places.

1:13:31.394 --> 1:13:33.463
Your father makes
wonderful salads.

1:13:33.529 --> 1:13:35.265
And, we have a rule.

1:13:35.331 --> 1:13:38.167
No more than 20 minutes
of TV a day.

1:13:59.889 --> 1:14:01.924
You're safe here, folks.
And remember,

1:14:01.991 --> 1:14:05.261
there's no better insurance
than a safe driver.

1:14:06.329 --> 1:14:07.196
Billy?

1:14:07.263 --> 1:14:09.432
Billy! You have to help me.

1:14:09.499 --> 1:14:10.867
Hey, Terrance, what's up?

1:14:10.933 --> 1:14:12.235
My new family...

1:14:12.302 --> 1:14:14.304
I have to do homework,
eat my vegetables.

1:14:14.370 --> 1:14:16.673
There's even a time limit on how
much I can watch TV.

1:14:16.739 --> 1:14:19.042
Maybe we should get out
of the city right now.

1:14:19.108 --> 1:14:20.476
Let's go to your mom's.

1:14:20.543 --> 1:14:21.911
Terrance can help her
clean up the basement

1:14:21.978 --> 1:14:22.945
and organize
her coin collection.

1:14:23.012 --> 1:14:24.247
You're gonna love it, buddy.

1:14:24.314 --> 1:14:27.183
No!

1:14:27.250 --> 1:14:29.452
I'm really happy
for you, Terrance!

1:14:29.519 --> 1:14:31.487
Whoo-hoo!
Pardon me.

1:14:48.504 --> 1:14:49.572
Hyah!

1:14:57.513 --> 1:14:58.915
Shazam!

1:15:22.638 --> 1:15:24.140
We're back!

1:15:24.207 --> 1:15:25.475
Oh, man,

1:15:25.541 --> 1:15:27.210
if I had to hear one more
of Superman's farm sayings,

1:15:27.276 --> 1:15:28.511
I might have quit the League.

1:15:28.578 --> 1:15:29.645
Oh, that's for sure.

1:15:29.712 --> 1:15:31.314
- You can say that again.
- Yeah.

1:15:31.381 --> 1:15:32.815
- It was awful.
- Yes, I couldn't agree more.

1:15:32.882 --> 1:15:34.217
They're not that bad.

1:15:36.586 --> 1:15:38.421
What did you do?

1:15:38.488 --> 1:15:39.455
No.

1:15:39.522 --> 1:15:40.189
No!

1:15:40.256 --> 1:15:42.358
The powers are mine!

1:15:42.425 --> 1:15:44.293
Shazam!

1:15:45.027 --> 1:15:46.429
Shazam.

1:15:48.030 --> 1:15:49.499
Shazam.

1:15:50.600 --> 1:15:52.935
Shazam!

1:15:54.771 --> 1:15:57.373
Looks like I might've
hijacked your magic.

1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:58.641
Sorry, not sorry.

1:16:03.746 --> 1:16:05.548
I'll get you, Shazam.

1:16:05.615 --> 1:16:09.018
Once I have my powers back,
you will be destr-

1:16:11.053 --> 1:16:12.455
Destroyed!

1:16:15.091 --> 1:16:17.593
Well, Shazam, you did it.

1:16:17.660 --> 1:16:19.462
No, we did it.

1:16:19.529 --> 1:16:22.365
But how did you know the lightning
would take away his powers?

1:16:22.432 --> 1:16:24.400
Or change us back to adults?

1:16:24.834 --> 1:16:26.402
Well,

1:16:26.469 --> 1:16:28.204
let's just say...

1:16:31.541 --> 1:16:32.975
I had a hunch.

1:16:33.911 --> 1:16:35.211
Hmm.

1:16:35.278 --> 1:16:37.547
So, now that we beat
the bad guy

1:16:37.613 --> 1:16:39.715
and everything
is back to normal,

1:16:39.782 --> 1:16:40.817
how should we celebrate?

1:16:40.884 --> 1:16:42.718
I know just the thing.

1:16:45.588 --> 1:16:48.357
Remember how I told you
that Bat Computer could find

1:16:48.424 --> 1:16:50.326
anyone anywhere?

1:16:50.393 --> 1:16:52.428
After you revealed
your identity to me,

1:16:52.495 --> 1:16:55.798
I had it search for any living
relatives you might have.

1:16:55.866 --> 1:16:57.033
You have two.

1:16:57.099 --> 1:16:59.302
Your uncle and...

1:17:00.036 --> 1:17:01.204
Billy?

1:17:01.804 --> 1:17:03.039
My sister.

1:17:03.539 --> 1:17:04.474
Billy!

1:17:07.743 --> 1:17:09.212
I'm Mary.

1:17:09.278 --> 1:17:10.948
And this is our Uncle Dudley.

1:17:11.013 --> 1:17:12.148
Hello, Billy.

1:17:15.151 --> 1:17:18.554
That's what I'd call
a happy ending.

1:17:18.621 --> 1:17:20.690
I'm okay.

1:18:07.737 --> 1:18:11.641
All I have to do
is find that Salvaxion warlord,

1:18:11.707 --> 1:18:14.810
and I'll be knee-deep
in targman moolah

1:18:14.878 --> 1:18:17.046
from now until next week.

1:18:21.117 --> 1:18:22.451
What is this?

1:18:22.518 --> 1:18:23.619
Let go!

1:18:23.686 --> 1:18:27.024
Well, what do we have here?

1:18:27.089 --> 1:18:29.692
What's your name, little fella?

1:18:29.759 --> 1:18:32.161
Mind, Mr. Mind.

1:18:32.228 --> 1:18:34.932
The greatest villain
in the galaxy.

1:18:34.998 --> 1:18:39.970
Wanted in over three quadrants
of the universe for my evil evilness.

1:18:40.037 --> 1:18:41.637
"Wanted," eh?

1:18:47.243 --> 1:18:50.047
This day just keeps
getting better.

1:18:50.112 --> 1:18:51.280
Huh?

1:18:51.982 --> 1:18:53.616
Oh, my.
