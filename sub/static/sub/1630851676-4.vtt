00:02.132 --> 00:03.220
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...

00:06.049 --> 00:08.530
<i>I'm the one you call
when you can't call 911.</i>

00:08.573 --> 00:11.054
What this house needs is trust.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.360
So I'm gonna
give her mine.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.014
<i>Maybe she'll do the same.</i>

00:14.057 --> 00:16.668
Guy I punched wasn't just
a lawyer. He was the A.D.A.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.801
Just as we go to trial,
he drops the case.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.324
He doesn't want to hurt
his conviction record

00:20.368 --> 00:22.674
because he may run
for office one day.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.502
D.A.'s put me
on this vigilante case.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.808
I know you had
a few run-ins with her.

00:25.851 --> 00:27.027
I wanted to ask you
some questions.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.246
<i>She's clever,</i>

00:29.290 --> 00:30.421
<i>uses sophisticated tactics.</i>

00:30.465 --> 00:32.119
- It won't be easy.
- Easy's no fun.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.120
I like the cat and mouse.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.121
Long as you're the cat.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.078
Oh, I'm not you.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.036
She's in my crosshairs,

00:36.079 --> 00:37.080
I won't hesitate to shoot.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.864
What the...

00:38.908 --> 00:39.996
Be careful what you ask for.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.432
Last night proved me right.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.217
The way to find her is
by looking into her associates.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.784
My mistake-- I've been looking
at the wrong one.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.963
Lou-wee.

00:51.007 --> 00:53.618
We coming for you.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.533
Get some rest,
pretty boy.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.448
We back at it
tomorrow.

01:02.758 --> 01:06.370
I got next. And it
ain't gonna be pretty.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.352
I smell bacon.

01:31.395 --> 01:33.397
Shut it, Gibson.

01:34.355 --> 01:35.834
Damn it. Man down.

01:35.878 --> 01:38.924
Man down!
Bring the cutter!

01:43.190 --> 01:45.279
$1,500? Have you
lost your mind?

01:45.322 --> 01:46.932
What? That's
just what they cost.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.586
Girl, that's too much to be
spending on a cell phone.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.675
Especially for someone
- without a job.
- Come on.

01:50.719 --> 01:53.678
There were literally stacks
of cash in that storage unit.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.942
- I can't pinch off a taste?
- Who are you,

01:56.986 --> 01:58.770
Delilah Soprano?

01:58.814 --> 02:01.208
That's not what
- that money is for.
- Okay, well, what about

02:01.251 --> 02:02.905
all of those sick electronics?

02:02.948 --> 02:05.255
I mean, who pays
for all that crazy stuff?

02:05.299 --> 02:06.865
I mean, you're connected, right?

02:06.909 --> 02:09.346
You got to have a hookup who
could slip me the latest phone.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.741
You know, someone at NSA.
Or Apple, maybe.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.134
I mean...

02:14.177 --> 02:15.135
do we get free stuff?

02:15.178 --> 02:16.919
Are we secretly rich?

02:16.962 --> 02:18.703
Got to be some perks, right?

02:18.747 --> 02:21.532
Yeah. What
are the perks?

02:23.534 --> 02:25.667
Saved by the cell.

02:26.450 --> 02:27.451
Work.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.323
I got to bounce.

02:30.237 --> 02:33.544
And the perks are you get
a roof over your head

02:33.588 --> 02:34.719
and food to eat.

02:34.763 --> 02:36.373
That's my money.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.984
You want a $1,500 phone,
go earn it.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.421
Are we still on for game night?

02:40.464 --> 02:41.857
You know it.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.206
We're not done
talking about this.

02:43.250 --> 02:46.035
I am. Good luck
with the job hunt.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.995
Thank you so much
for coming.

02:50.039 --> 02:52.302
This is Luis, my grandson.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.912
He-He's not built for prison.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.827
The men inside,
they put him

02:55.871 --> 02:57.525
through so much physical
and mental abuse.

02:57.568 --> 02:58.743
He couldn't take it.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.049
He hung himself.

03:00.092 --> 03:02.921
Now he's clinging
to life in a coma.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.880
We don't know
if he's going to make it.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.577
So what led to all of this?

03:06.621 --> 03:08.100
Almost two years ago,

03:08.144 --> 03:10.146
Luis was arrested
for stealing a car.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.017
They say that
they have witnesses.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.106
But he didn't do it. He was with
me at the time of the robbery,

03:14.150 --> 03:16.196
and I have video evidence
to prove it.

03:16.239 --> 03:19.111
I turned it over to the police,
but... I don't even know

03:19.155 --> 03:20.896
if the prosecutors
have looked at it.

03:20.939 --> 03:22.854
They tried to
get him to plea,

03:22.898 --> 03:25.901
but he refused to admit to
something that he didn't do.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.687
We wanted to raise bail,
but they set it so high.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.428
And we're struggling
just to make ends meet.

03:31.472 --> 03:34.214
Two years?
And still awaiting trial?

03:34.257 --> 03:35.302
It keeps getting pushed.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.738
Evidence analysis,

03:36.781 --> 03:39.393
attorney schedules--
all these excuses.

03:39.436 --> 03:40.742
"The People aren't ready."

03:40.785 --> 03:43.223
Yeah, that's the phrase
the prosecutors use.

03:44.049 --> 03:47.444
Meantime, Luis is left to rot.

03:47.488 --> 03:49.620
I'm sorry about your grandson,

03:49.664 --> 03:52.014
but I don't know
how I can help,

03:52.057 --> 03:54.408
other than to secure you
a better lawyer.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.497
This isn't about Luis.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.585
This is about
his father,

03:57.628 --> 03:59.282
Hector, my son.

03:59.326 --> 04:00.718
He didn't show up
to work yesterday

04:00.762 --> 04:02.938
and he's not answering
his phone.

04:02.981 --> 04:05.462
He's never missed
a day in 32 years.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.423
Hector blames the D.A.
for what's happened to Luis.

04:09.466 --> 04:10.946
He's so angry.

04:10.989 --> 04:13.383
I'm worried that he's going
to do something bad.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.037
What makes you say that?

04:16.343 --> 04:18.170
No, I am not concerned
about the allegations

04:18.214 --> 04:19.737
leveled against my department.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.130
Our probe will be thorough,

04:21.173 --> 04:22.566
and we'll deal with
the problem accordingly.

04:22.610 --> 04:23.915
You're the problem!

04:23.959 --> 04:25.569
Locking up innocent people

04:25.613 --> 04:29.356
like my son! It's your fault
that he did this to himself!

04:29.399 --> 04:31.183
I hope you burn in hell!

04:32.054 --> 04:33.316
Well, I can see why
the family's worried.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.057
Well, I can't say
I blame him.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.754
I mean, the BS charges,

04:36.798 --> 04:38.278
constant court delays,
his son tries

04:38.321 --> 04:40.062
to take his own life... We have to find him.

04:40.105 --> 04:42.194
- What do you got so far?
- Nothing you're gonna like.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.631
Hector's phone
has been turned off

04:43.674 --> 04:44.893
since the day
he went missing.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.373
Phone records indicate
a barrage of calls

04:46.416 --> 04:47.417
to the D.A.'s office.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.897
But most concerning

04:48.940 --> 04:50.768
are these photos
I found on his iCloud.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.509
Taken in the last two days.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.294
Looks like
he was surveilling her.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.426
Do you think he'd
really try to hurt the D.A.?

04:56.470 --> 04:58.428
Doesn't matter, because
we're gonna find him first.

04:58.472 --> 04:59.777
And if we don't?

04:59.821 --> 05:00.865
I mean, Rob,
if this guy's after blood,

05:00.909 --> 05:01.910
we got to pull
the cops in.

05:01.953 --> 05:02.954
But what if he's not?

05:02.998 --> 05:04.565
We don't know
what Hector's doing.

05:04.608 --> 05:05.957
If we go to the cops--

05:06.001 --> 05:08.786
angry brown man,
public feud with the D.A.--

05:08.830 --> 05:10.353
we all know how that movie ends.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.964
What are we supposed to do,
um, let him kill the D.A.?

05:13.704 --> 05:15.663
No, we tell someone
we can trust.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.534
In the meantime,

05:17.578 --> 05:19.057
see if you can locate Hector

05:19.101 --> 05:20.798
before he does something
that'll get himself killed.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.991
<i>Hang on.</i>

05:40.035 --> 05:41.819
You're telling me you're aware
of a credible threat

05:41.863 --> 05:43.778
against the D.A.
but you won't tell me by who?

05:43.821 --> 05:45.127
I don't know if it's credible.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.650
I'm just trying
to prevent a tragedy.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.130
Then give me a name.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.523
I can't do that.
It'll force your hand.

05:49.566 --> 05:52.134
You'll be obligated to
turn it over to NYPD.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.179
The threat's your client.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.268
And I won't put them at risk

05:56.312 --> 05:58.401
with your overly
ambitious colleagues.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.839
But you do need to bolster up
security for D.A. Grafton.

06:01.883 --> 06:04.102
I can't. Not without a name
or any concrete...

06:04.146 --> 06:05.452
- Arrest me.
- What?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.323
Cuff me. Now. Do it.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.672
NYPD!

06:08.716 --> 06:09.760
Stop right there!

06:13.242 --> 06:15.244
Let me see those hands.

06:15.287 --> 06:17.377
The hell's going on, Dante?

06:17.420 --> 06:18.378
What does it look like?

06:19.248 --> 06:21.206
I've apprehended the vigilante.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.527
Babe, will you stop?

06:37.571 --> 06:39.486
We're not gonna find Hector by
looking at random street cams.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.704
You know what
the odds are?

06:40.748 --> 06:42.314
Eight and a half million
in the city.

06:42.358 --> 06:43.707
Spot 100 people
an hour.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.014
What is that,
one in 85,000?

06:46.057 --> 06:47.319
It's better
than the lottery.

06:47.363 --> 06:49.104
It's why we don't
play the lottery.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.106
Look, I tagged his financials.
I tagged his phone.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.716
He's bound to come up
for air eventually.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.848
Yeah, I don't like waiting.

06:53.891 --> 06:55.197
You were a sniper.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.373
I mean, that was
literally 90% of your job.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.595
It's just so unfair

07:01.638 --> 07:03.858
how the bail system
is rigged against the poor.

07:03.901 --> 07:05.163
Two people could commit
the same crime.

07:05.207 --> 07:06.643
But if you're rich,
you pay bail,

07:06.687 --> 07:07.688
you go home
to your bed and family.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.385
But if you're poor,

07:09.429 --> 07:11.561
you get thrown into
a cement room till prosecut... Oh, my God.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.520
What? You saw Hector?
I knew it! Where?

07:13.563 --> 07:15.130
No. McCall.

07:15.173 --> 07:16.218
What?

07:16.261 --> 07:17.741
She's been arrested.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.358
<i>You think I don't know
what's happening?</i>

07:26.402 --> 07:27.359
<i>You only arrested her</i>

07:27.403 --> 07:28.491
to save your ass.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.233
Madam D.A.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.409
Congratulations,
Detective Dante.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.238
Unexpected, after you excused
yourself from this case.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.196
Just in the right place
at the right time.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.023
Hmm.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.982
So, who is she, really?

07:41.025 --> 07:42.897
Refused to give a name.
No I.D. No prints.

07:42.940 --> 07:43.767
And this threat

07:43.811 --> 07:45.465
against me. You believe her?

07:45.508 --> 07:47.075
- I do.
- But she won't reveal

07:47.118 --> 07:48.468
the person's identity.

07:53.255 --> 07:55.257
All right.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.488
Have a seat.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.359
I'd prefer
to stand.

08:11.795 --> 08:14.537
So you're the vigilante
everybody's been talking about.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.714
What is it? "Got a problem?
Odds against you?"

08:17.758 --> 08:19.020
That's a cute slogan.

08:19.063 --> 08:21.631
It's more of a mission
than a slogan.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.939
Yeah. Well, I think your mission
just came to a close.

08:24.982 --> 08:27.594
But, honestly,
I'm a little disappointed.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.857
Thought it'd be more
of a challenge.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.816
Well, what can I say?
You have a crack team.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.646
I understand you have
some information for me.

08:36.690 --> 08:37.908
More of a warning.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.127
Right, but you're
not gonna tell me

08:39.170 --> 08:40.607
the source
of this threat.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.044
Isn't it enough
knowing your life is in danger?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.308
And if I release you,
you're gonna...

08:46.351 --> 08:48.266
make sure nothing happens to me?

08:48.310 --> 08:49.833
And I'll be so grateful,

08:49.877 --> 08:51.574
I'll call off
the dogs?

08:52.575 --> 08:54.359
The threat is real.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.492
So why not take
precautions?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.407
Beef up security,

08:58.450 --> 08:59.930
just in case?

08:59.974 --> 09:03.238
Because I don't tend to follow
the advice of criminals.

09:03.281 --> 09:04.674
And even if
you're right,

09:04.718 --> 09:07.547
people coming after me
isn't breaking news.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.636
People being mad at the D.A.,

09:09.679 --> 09:11.333
it's part
of the job description.

09:11.376 --> 09:12.595
Too bad.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.423
I thought
you were smarter than this.

09:14.466 --> 09:15.816
I thought you were, too.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.601
Now, if you'll excuse me,

09:18.645 --> 09:20.690
I have more criminals to catch.

09:22.518 --> 09:23.824
By the way...

09:25.434 --> 09:26.827
...don't be too disappointed.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.872
I'm just passing through.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.225
Proceed with the charges.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.053
What about
- the threat?
- I don't think there is one.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.578
I think she's fronting.
Trying to strike a deal.

09:38.621 --> 09:39.753
I don't think
that's her style.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.319
We need to take
this seriously.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.018
All right. I'll
tighten up my security.

09:44.061 --> 09:45.672
But I need you two
to follow this up,

09:45.715 --> 09:46.934
see what she's hiding.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.631
It might be better
if I work on this alone.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.111
You said that
about catching her, too.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.112
No. I think

09:51.155 --> 09:52.417
Detective Dante
here understands

09:52.461 --> 09:53.462
this vigilante in a way

09:53.505 --> 09:54.637
that neither of us ever will.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.682
So,

09:55.725 --> 09:58.380
you two play nice

09:58.423 --> 10:00.251
and get it done.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.167
Hear that?

10:03.211 --> 10:04.691
Play nice.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.910
Playtime's over.

10:12.307 --> 10:13.917
Something funny?

10:16.659 --> 10:19.227
You're pretty upbeat for someone
who's up to their neck in it.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.838
I'm just a glass-half-full
kind of girl.

10:21.882 --> 10:22.926
I don't know why.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.754
You are in
for a world of hurt.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.582
Really, Buford?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.149
Is that what we're doing?

10:29.019 --> 10:30.934
Kenneth Buford Mallory of Ohio.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.633
Bullied as a kid.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.896
Stuttered till age nine.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.028
Yeah, I know all about you,
Buford.

10:38.072 --> 10:41.205
Reinvented yourself
at Fresno State.

10:41.249 --> 10:42.685
Average GPA.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.514
Graduated the middle
of your detective class.

10:45.557 --> 10:48.082
Known as the Big Game Hunter.

10:49.561 --> 10:52.564
You've never hunted game
like me.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.393
Here's the deal.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.265
You're gonna tell me who you are

10:57.308 --> 10:59.049
and who wants to hurt the D.A.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.312
and I'm gonna make things
go easy for you.

11:01.356 --> 11:02.705
What we talking,

11:02.749 --> 11:04.011
reduced sentence?

11:04.054 --> 11:05.882
Uh, putting in a good word
with the D.A.?

11:05.926 --> 11:07.362
That sort
of thing?

11:08.624 --> 11:10.191
You know,

11:10.234 --> 11:11.540
my dad used to say,

11:11.583 --> 11:13.368
"God wants you to walk,

11:13.411 --> 11:15.065
and the devil sends a limo."

11:15.109 --> 11:17.894
I'll tell you what
you can do for me.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.723
You can give me
my first phone call.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.377
I believe I get three.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.074
That's how you want to play it?

11:24.118 --> 11:28.383
I can make it my mission
to make this hard on you.

11:28.426 --> 11:31.038
You do you.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.474
Phone call.

11:32.517 --> 11:33.867
<i>Are you sure</i>

11:33.910 --> 11:35.390
- we can talk freely?
- Yeah, I'm on a pay phone.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.739
They're not allowed
to listen in.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.175
I encrypted the line,
just in case.

11:38.219 --> 11:39.568
Okay, so tell me,

11:39.611 --> 11:41.439
how the hell did you let
yourself get arrested?

11:41.483 --> 11:44.094
No choice. I could've escaped,
but I would've left Dante

11:44.138 --> 11:45.748
in a bad spot.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.489
Where are we
- with finding our friend?
We just got a hit

11:47.532 --> 11:49.621
on Hector's credit card, like,
two minutes before you called.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.232
Looks like he rented a room
at a residency hotel

11:51.275 --> 11:52.363
on the East Side.

11:52.407 --> 11:53.625
He could be hiding out there.

11:53.669 --> 11:54.801
Mel, you're gonna have
to check it out.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.193
But you got to get there fast.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.978
The D.A. and the police
are mobilizing.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.370
Won't take them long before
they're onto the same path

11:59.414 --> 12:00.502
- as us.
- Okay.

12:00.545 --> 12:01.895
But what about you? How are we

12:01.938 --> 12:03.157
gonna getyou out?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.114
Don't know yet,

12:04.158 --> 12:05.420
but I'm working on it.

12:05.463 --> 12:06.595
Should we call Bishop?

12:06.638 --> 12:08.815
No. He's radio silent
on a mission.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.686
What about your family?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.601
I would rather not
if I don't have to.

12:12.644 --> 12:13.776
Look, I'm good.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.473
Priority is finding Hector.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.736
Okay.

12:16.866 --> 12:18.172
Text me the address, babe.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.477
Uh, hold on a sec.
You're not going on your own.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.958
- Of course I am.
- Babe, look at this.

12:23.090 --> 12:24.439
No cams, which means

12:24.482 --> 12:25.483
I can't watch your back.

12:25.527 --> 12:26.484
I'm gonna go with you.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.008
No. Babe, I know you really want

12:28.051 --> 12:29.749
to get back out in the world,
but I can handle myself.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.576
It's not about that. Yes,
of course I want to get back

12:31.620 --> 12:33.578
out there, but it's about me
knowing that you're safe.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.406
- I'm gonna be fine.
- Look, you can go on your own,

12:35.450 --> 12:36.668
but I'm just gonna
follow you anyway.

12:36.712 --> 12:37.800
And we can play
the...

12:37.844 --> 12:39.236
whole hide-and-seek thing,
you know,

12:39.280 --> 12:40.760
but you're gonna spot me,
because you're awesome.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.022
And we're gonna argue,

12:42.065 --> 12:43.763
and you'll secretly think
it's adorable

12:43.806 --> 12:45.112
that I'm so protective and
you're gonna forgive me anyway.

12:45.155 --> 12:46.809
So why don't
we just skip all that?

12:51.074 --> 12:52.772
You are adorable. Let's go.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.868
That's my space.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.828
Maybe you didn't hear me.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.917
Little girl,
it's been a long morning.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.789
- It's about to get longer.
- Yeah.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.660
But not for me.

13:13.488 --> 13:14.576
- Now, if you
don't mind,

13:14.619 --> 13:15.925
my feet hurt.

13:15.969 --> 13:17.927
And I'm not trying
to sweat out my edges.

13:17.971 --> 13:19.799
So I'm gonna sit down.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.104
I suggest...

13:21.148 --> 13:22.802
that you do
the same.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.027
Shut up.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.247
Back off of her.

13:34.161 --> 13:35.640
Unless you want some, too.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.518
<i>Yo. Mallory.</i>

13:47.609 --> 13:49.002
What can I say? A whole lot
of people have motive

13:49.045 --> 13:50.264
to hurt the D.A.

13:50.307 --> 13:51.178
Clearly.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.183
Hold on to those.

13:57.532 --> 14:00.143
What do you got there?

14:00.187 --> 14:01.841
She said play nice.

14:02.667 --> 14:03.668
Best guesses.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.887
A Mob-connected hitter.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.671
Female fraud case facing

14:06.715 --> 14:08.108
serious federal time.

14:08.151 --> 14:10.893
And Hector Ramos,
a guy who confronted the D.A.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.895
Let me take a look.

14:19.510 --> 14:21.077
Wait. Hold on.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.253
This is the guy who
started screaming at the D.A.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.299
- during a presser.
- Mm-hmm.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.170
Son was arrested under
questionable circumstances.

14:27.214 --> 14:28.606
Now he's
in the hospital?

14:28.650 --> 14:30.608
In critical condition
after a suicide attempt.

14:30.652 --> 14:31.958
Doesn't look good.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.699
This sob story is
exactly the vigilante's type.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.136
This Hector is our guy.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.094
What I thought. I got
into his cell records.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.488
Ramos made a string of calls
to the D.A.'s office

14:40.531 --> 14:41.750
in the last week.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.926
Return call from
A.D.A. Walter Ellis's office.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.842
Spoke to Hector
for over ten minutes.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.584
Hold on. Ellis.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.586
This is the same A.D.A.
you got suspended

14:51.629 --> 14:53.066
for punching in the face?

14:53.109 --> 14:55.895
I like to think of him
as the A.D.A. who prioritized

14:55.938 --> 14:58.941
his conviction record
over the life of a witness.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.900
Oh, man.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.902
This just keeps getting
better and better.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.686
You know we got
to go talk to him, right?

15:04.729 --> 15:06.470
Yeah. I know.

15:06.514 --> 15:07.732
Do me a favor.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.821
Keep your hands
to yourself, eh, champ?

15:09.865 --> 15:11.998
Keep talking and you're next.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.390
Champ.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.740
<i>After the press conference,</i>

15:15.784 --> 15:18.482
I talked to Mr. Ramos
at the behest of the D.A.

15:18.526 --> 15:19.962
What about?

15:20.006 --> 15:21.877
I mostly tried to listen.
He was upset.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.010
That sort of thing
can be difficult on a family.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.795
In your estimation,
is he capable of violence?

15:26.838 --> 15:30.190
I suppose everyone is capable
of violence... Detective.

15:30.233 --> 15:34.237
True. But then sometimes
people have it coming.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.198
So, in your opinion,

15:38.241 --> 15:41.549
Hector Ramos is capable
of hurting the D.A.?

15:41.592 --> 15:43.072
The man's son is in a coma

15:43.116 --> 15:44.900
after sitting in a prison
for two years.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.555
And as a father, I can't imagine
what that must be like.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.861
You know? Who knows
- what he's capable of.
- If your office

15:49.905 --> 15:52.560
cared so much, why didn't
you just expedite the case?

15:52.603 --> 15:53.909
Oh, right.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.345
'Cause you know better
than anyone

15:55.389 --> 15:56.564
how justice should be served.

15:56.607 --> 15:59.349
Everyone gets
a fair trial, Detective.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.047
Sometimes it takes time.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.700
We need
to be thorough.

16:02.744 --> 16:03.745
So if the gears
of justice

16:03.788 --> 16:05.399
move a little too slow for you,

16:05.442 --> 16:07.967
maybe you should've chosen
a different profession.

16:09.403 --> 16:10.795
Thanks for the time.

16:16.584 --> 16:17.672
Hector's our guy
for sure.

16:17.715 --> 16:18.760
I'll put in
for a search warrant.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.718
Yeah. Do that.

16:20.762 --> 16:21.937
I got to say,

16:21.981 --> 16:23.983
you really know
how to make friends.

16:24.809 --> 16:25.767
Shut up.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.299
Housekeeping.

16:36.343 --> 16:39.955
This is why I
should've come solo.

16:43.741 --> 16:46.048
Uh-oh. Come here.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.750
Looks like he's planning
to merc the D.A.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.665
at her next
city hall presser.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.669
Hey, look, I know
I don't get out much.

16:58.713 --> 17:01.281
There's just something about
all this that feels a little...

17:01.324 --> 17:02.891
I don't know, weird.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.849
You mean the...

17:04.893 --> 17:06.373
perfect abundance
of evidence implicating Hector?

17:06.416 --> 17:09.854
Yeah. It's almost
like it's staged.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.075
Hey!

17:30.571 --> 17:33.182
Oh, my God!
That was so hot. Are you okay?

17:33.226 --> 17:34.749
That definitely wasn't Hector.

17:34.792 --> 17:35.402
So who the hell was that?

17:42.887 --> 17:45.586
I can't make
a fist. So stupid.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.066
Which is why you should've
stayed home in the first place.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.197
Well, it's a good
thing I didn't.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.198
Why the hell
did that guy have

17:49.242 --> 17:50.460
Hector's room key?

17:50.504 --> 17:52.506
Check this out.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.032
Madero's?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.251
That's Hector's family's
food truck.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.339
Our guy was wearing gloves.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.688
He didn't want to leave prints

18:00.731 --> 18:02.168
because he was leaving Hector's.

18:02.211 --> 18:05.345
20 bucks says Hector's prints
are all over these.

18:05.388 --> 18:06.563
They're trying to set Hector up.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.217
Whoever that was

18:08.261 --> 18:10.654
is planning on taking out the
D.A. and then pinning it on him.

18:10.698 --> 18:14.571
And this was supposed to be
found after the assassination.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.095
Luis's suicide attempt

18:16.138 --> 18:18.140
and Hector's anger
made him the ideal patsy.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.533
We got to let Rob know.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.100
Well, maybe this slug

18:21.143 --> 18:22.318
will give us some answers

18:22.362 --> 18:23.711
to who's
behind this.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.191
Mel, cops. We got to go.

18:25.234 --> 18:27.280
- Yeah, one second. Wait.
- No, no, no. Now.

18:27.323 --> 18:29.108
The moment they step foot
in here, it'll only confirm

18:29.151 --> 18:30.587
that Hector's a threat
to the D.A.

18:30.631 --> 18:31.719
We should clean this up.

18:31.762 --> 18:32.720
We don't have time.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.069
Yes! Got it.

18:34.113 --> 18:34.983
Good. Let's go.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.184
My lawyer.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.447
Right.

19:04.491 --> 19:07.146
We found a room
rented to Hector Ramos.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.060
There was a lot of
incriminating evidence

19:09.104 --> 19:10.453
that he's targeting the D.A.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.412
- But?
- I don't know.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.457
The way it was all laid
out didn't sit right.

19:14.501 --> 19:17.286
Little things, like
why use a credit card

19:17.330 --> 19:19.767
that can be easily traced?
Why not use cash?

19:19.810 --> 19:22.030
Because they're setting Hector
up to be the patsy.

19:27.253 --> 19:28.210
Gift from your lawyer?

19:28.254 --> 19:29.777
Can you run ballistics?

19:29.820 --> 19:30.908
How's it related?

19:30.952 --> 19:32.083
Where did this come from?

19:32.127 --> 19:33.346
Not important right now.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.174
But the D.A. needs
to go underground.

19:35.217 --> 19:37.654
These people could kill her
at any moment.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.178
Info from Hector's
room points to it

19:39.221 --> 19:41.180
going down at the D.A.'s
city hall presser.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.311
We'll be ready.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.660
It's not gonna happen
where you think.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.402
Whoever's behind this knows
you found the SRO.

19:46.446 --> 19:48.187
Their plan will change.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.710
The D.A.'s still in danger.

19:50.711 --> 19:51.842
One more thing.

19:51.886 --> 19:54.497
I need my second phone call.

19:54.541 --> 19:55.281
Jail?

19:55.324 --> 19:56.412
I have it under control.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.805
I'm booked as a Jane Doe.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.110
They don't know who I am.

19:59.154 --> 20:00.460
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

20:00.503 --> 20:02.679
How long
till they figure it out?

20:02.723 --> 20:03.941
What then?

20:03.985 --> 20:05.639
I'm gonna make sure
it doesn't come to that.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.903
You know what?

20:08.946 --> 20:12.211
I'm gonna trust
that you know what you're doing.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.212
What do you need?

20:13.255 --> 20:14.865
Game night.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.867
I'm not gonna make it.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.348
In fact, I'm not coming home
at all tonight.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.785
What do I tell Dee?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.267
The truth.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.357
I promised her honesty.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.491
Okay. I'll handle it.

20:31.534 --> 20:34.363
In the meantime, just, please,

20:34.407 --> 20:35.973
take care of yourself.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.888
Get out of there.

20:37.932 --> 20:39.803
Come home.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.762
I always do.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.159
Hey. Was that Mom?

20:52.990 --> 20:55.036
What? She ready for a beatdown?

20:56.211 --> 20:57.473
About that...

20:58.431 --> 21:01.129
Your mom's not coming home
tonight.

21:02.173 --> 21:03.784
'Kay. Why not?

21:04.567 --> 21:05.960
Do you really want to know?

21:06.003 --> 21:07.527
Yeah. Yes.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.093
I mean, of course I do.

21:10.225 --> 21:12.183
She was arrested. She's in jail.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.750
Arrested? For what?

21:13.794 --> 21:15.317
- I don't know.
- How bad is it?

21:15.361 --> 21:16.275
I don't know.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.059
Oh, my God.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.321
Look...

21:20.583 --> 21:22.846
Your mom is the most
competent person I know.

21:24.152 --> 21:25.632
She said not to worry.

21:25.675 --> 21:27.721
So...

21:27.764 --> 21:30.941
that's exactly what we're going
to help each other do.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.556
<i>Hey.</i>

21:36.599 --> 21:38.035
Rob's got the bullet.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.428
She knows the clock's
ticking to find Hector.

21:39.472 --> 21:40.951
How's she holding up?

21:40.995 --> 21:43.780
Well, I mean, she says
she's got it under control.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.347
But you don't believe her.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.696
What if she doesn't?

21:46.740 --> 21:48.872
What if she's just...
telling us that?

21:48.916 --> 21:51.092
Then we have to think
of something quick.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.354
'Cause as soon
as she gets transferred

21:52.398 --> 21:53.921
to the Tombs tomorrow,
it's gonna be

21:53.964 --> 21:55.009
a lot harder
to save her.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.403
Okay, that's a little tight.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.379
<i>Ay.</i>

22:17.423 --> 22:19.163
Don't stop, Abuelo.

22:19.207 --> 22:20.600
That's my favorite part.

22:20.643 --> 22:22.253
Nurse!

22:27.433 --> 22:29.826
Where's Dad?

22:48.671 --> 22:50.673
Eat.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.255
Just think about it.

23:07.298 --> 23:09.213
Why the hell would I go
to some dumbass counseling

23:09.257 --> 23:12.042
for a whole year when I can do
two months in county and be out?

23:12.086 --> 23:13.522
Well, it's your choice...

23:13.566 --> 23:15.176
And I've made my decision.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.582
You don't have to be so tough,
you know.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.933
Whatever.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.543
I mean, he's right.

23:34.587 --> 23:37.807
Counseling beats
jail every time.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.419
My bad.

23:40.462 --> 23:43.509
The way you came at me earlier,
I thought you had heart.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.642
Come on.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.470
Let's go again and find out.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.516
Instead of trying to fight me,

23:50.559 --> 23:52.692
why don't you fight
for yourself?

23:55.390 --> 23:57.087
You don't know me.

23:57.131 --> 24:00.308
I know exactly who you are.
Because I've been you.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.744
You talking all this mess,

24:01.788 --> 24:03.790
but you sitting right here
next to me.

24:04.878 --> 24:07.446
Well, everything you see
is not always what it seems.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.970
You come off all hard,

24:10.013 --> 24:13.277
but what I see is
a scared young girl

24:13.321 --> 24:14.714
trying to do the best she can.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.456
I'm not scared of nothing.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.936
Prove it. Because
part of being brave

24:19.980 --> 24:23.723
is also making hard choices
to change your life.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.509
I've been
where you are.

24:27.553 --> 24:30.730
It just took someone to believe
in me for me to understand.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.734
Yeah, well, look around.

24:34.777 --> 24:37.737
Ain't a whole lot of people
lining up to believe in me.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.006
All it takes is one.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.313
But you still got
to do the hard work.

24:49.357 --> 24:51.011
You mean that talk BS?

24:52.316 --> 24:53.535
Ain't nothing
but a waste of time.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.145
You think it makes you soft.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.757
But it takes strength
to look inside.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.499
Especially if
you've been hurt.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.719
But if you don't
deal with it now,

25:03.763 --> 25:05.765
that little two-month vacay

25:05.808 --> 25:07.897
will turn into a life sentence.

25:09.464 --> 25:12.772
Being in fear of
your life 24/7.

25:12.815 --> 25:15.775
The sound of a dead body
hitting a concrete floor.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.169
The pain you feel
when the world outside

25:19.213 --> 25:21.302
is moving on
without you.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.434
That's what you're looking at.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.568
I ain't got time for this.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.787
Make time.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.397
Because I
don't think

25:29.440 --> 25:30.616
I'm wrong about you.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.141
Unless this is
who you think you are.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.060
Good news.

25:40.103 --> 25:42.323
Luis Ramos is
out of his coma

25:42.366 --> 25:43.803
and in stable condition.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.500
- That is good news.
- Again,

25:45.544 --> 25:48.416
where'd this bullet come from
and how is it connected to this?

25:48.459 --> 25:50.374
Why? What'd you find?

25:50.418 --> 25:52.551
Ballistics traced
it back to a gun

25:52.594 --> 25:55.684
connected to the
Bridgetown Clique.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.425
You heard of them.

25:57.468 --> 25:58.687
So you know they
have their hands

25:58.731 --> 26:00.559
in pretty much everything.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.735
Auto theft, bookmaking,
credit card fraud,

26:02.778 --> 26:04.475
you name it.
Crew's run

26:04.519 --> 26:05.868
by a guy named Johnny O

26:05.912 --> 26:09.306
out of an old-school
cigar lounge in Queens.

26:09.350 --> 26:10.786
D.A. have a case on him?

26:10.830 --> 26:12.701
Nothing pending. NYPD's
been trying to take 'em down

26:12.745 --> 26:15.095
for years, but they keep
slipping through our fingers.

26:15.138 --> 26:17.532
Well, there must be a reason
they're moving on her.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.751
Just because the gun
traced back to them

26:18.794 --> 26:20.187
doesn't mean they're
behind the threat.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.624
Guns change hands in
the streets all the time.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.757
I can find out.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.586
But I'm gonna need
my third phone call.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.204
Do you have that file open yet?

26:37.247 --> 26:39.119
Well, uh,

26:39.162 --> 26:40.076
hang on, Rob.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.600
The, uh, computer

26:41.643 --> 26:43.689
is moving a little slow today.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.431
No good deed. I feel like

26:47.475 --> 26:49.129
Tony Stark without his suit.

26:49.172 --> 26:50.739
Aw. Or his money.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.219
Want me to type for you?

26:52.262 --> 26:53.220
- Back off.
- All right.

26:53.263 --> 26:54.613
This is my thing.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.837
Okay.

27:01.881 --> 27:04.057
Known members
of the Bridgetown Clique.

27:06.929 --> 27:09.149
That's him! That's our shooter!
Rob, we got him.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.327
<i>The shooter's name
is Mitch Soraci.</i>

27:13.370 --> 27:15.068
He's a Bridgetown enforcer.

27:15.111 --> 27:17.113
I don't understand.
Why is Johnny O's crew

27:17.157 --> 27:18.245
targeting the D.A.?

27:18.288 --> 27:19.594
I don't know.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.509
But when Hector
went after the D.A. publicly,

27:21.552 --> 27:23.119
he became the perfect guy
to frame.

27:23.163 --> 27:24.817
They set up that SRO
to make it look like

27:24.860 --> 27:26.383
he's been planning this
for days.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.733
When the D.A.'s killed,

27:27.776 --> 27:29.909
they won't leave Hector
as a loose end.

27:29.952 --> 27:32.172
They'll kill him
after they kill her.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.130
Which means
Hector's still alive.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.610
We have to save him.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.612
We got to get
to Johnny O,

27:37.656 --> 27:38.961
find out what his plan is.

27:39.005 --> 27:40.310
We've been trying for years.

27:40.354 --> 27:42.443
NYPD's never been about
to get close.

27:42.486 --> 27:43.531
I can.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.533
But I can't do it
from in here.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.230
What?

27:47.274 --> 27:50.364
They're transferring me
to the Tombs in an hour.

27:50.407 --> 27:51.582
Once I'm in there,

27:51.626 --> 27:52.801
I can't help you.

27:52.845 --> 27:54.847
Do you know
what you're asking me?

27:54.890 --> 27:57.327
I'm asking you to save the D.A.

27:58.372 --> 27:59.634
If you don't get me out of here,

27:59.678 --> 28:01.636
we'll have two deaths
on our hands.

28:08.730 --> 28:09.862
What I don't want is a scene.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.428
It's a public event
with a lot of press.

28:11.472 --> 28:12.734
Understood. We'll take him
before he even makes it

28:12.778 --> 28:15.694
- through the door.
- Lou.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.217
How's our Jane Doe
in holding?

28:17.260 --> 28:19.045
She was moved to the Tombs
about 20 minutes go.

28:19.088 --> 28:20.350
- No issues?
- No.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.265
Dante escorted her
there personally.

28:23.527 --> 28:24.964
Damn it.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.447
Five calls to your voice mail?

28:30.491 --> 28:32.145
Your boy is
awful needy.

28:32.188 --> 28:33.624
He's needy all right.

28:33.668 --> 28:36.105
- Needs to make me suffer.
- You think he's coming for you?

28:36.149 --> 28:38.804
He's got his hands full
running security for the D.A.

28:38.847 --> 28:41.850
Besides, I haven't
done anything wrong.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.373
Yet.

28:43.417 --> 28:44.592
Just hope

28:44.635 --> 28:45.767
you're right about all this

28:45.811 --> 28:47.769
and you can get
to Johnny O.

28:47.813 --> 28:48.596
I got you.

28:48.639 --> 28:49.945
This is what I do.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.512
I'll tell you what.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.079
When this is all over,

28:53.122 --> 28:54.471
if you need to take me back...

28:55.298 --> 28:56.996
...I'll go.

28:57.039 --> 28:58.084
Willingly.

29:06.396 --> 29:07.441
So...

29:08.834 --> 29:11.619
...guess you're taking
me to school today?

29:12.359 --> 29:13.969
Guess I am.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.929
And we're still not...

29:16.972 --> 29:18.321
worrying?

29:18.365 --> 29:21.150
Yeah. We're
absolutely not worrying.

29:21.194 --> 29:23.326
Okay.
Yeah.

29:23.370 --> 29:25.938
Okay.

29:25.981 --> 29:28.114
All right, no, there's got
to be something we can do.

29:28.157 --> 29:30.116
I mean, what,
she didn't leave instructions?

29:30.159 --> 29:31.639
Someone to call in case

29:31.682 --> 29:33.423
- of an emergency?
- Honey, I don't think your mom

29:33.467 --> 29:35.077
was planning
on getting arrested.

29:35.904 --> 29:38.994
Well... can't we call
a bail bondsman or-or a lawyer?

29:39.038 --> 29:41.823
There's got to be someone
who can get her out.

29:41.867 --> 29:45.044
I've thought of all that. I am
ready to move heaven and earth

29:45.087 --> 29:47.437
to help your mom.
But anything we do

29:47.481 --> 29:50.049
risks exposing her. No.

29:50.092 --> 29:53.356
As hard as this is,
we just have to trust her.

29:54.314 --> 29:55.532
One thing about your Mom--

29:55.576 --> 29:57.926
she knows how to take
care of herself.

30:03.889 --> 30:04.890
Johnny O.

30:04.933 --> 30:07.109
You wondering
about your men?

30:07.153 --> 30:08.676
They were tired.

30:08.719 --> 30:10.330
You're working 'em too hard.

30:10.373 --> 30:11.592
Who the hell are you?

30:11.635 --> 30:14.116
Doesn't matter.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.031
I heard a rumor

30:16.075 --> 30:18.033
that you've arranged
a hit on the D.A.

30:18.077 --> 30:20.644
and you're using Hector Ramos
as a patsy.

30:20.688 --> 30:23.560
Which is kind
of a problem.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.607
Because Hector...

30:26.650 --> 30:28.565
is a friend of mine.

30:28.609 --> 30:31.307
Sounds more like a conspiracy
than a rumor.

30:31.351 --> 30:32.918
This would go a whole lot easier

30:32.961 --> 30:34.963
if you just told me
where he was.

30:35.007 --> 30:37.270
I don't know anything about it.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.185
Imagine my surprise.

30:39.228 --> 30:41.404
Don't let the money fool you,
sweetheart.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.363
I live for this.

30:43.406 --> 30:46.714
I don't know how you got in here
or how you got past my men,

30:46.757 --> 30:48.890
but now I'm here.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.806
Which means that you are lucky
to still be alive.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.896
So unless you got something
to say to me,

30:54.940 --> 30:57.333
I suggest you find your way out,

30:57.377 --> 30:59.031
while you still can.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.728
My cigar club,

31:00.771 --> 31:02.686
it's for members only.

31:03.557 --> 31:05.864
It's a nice club.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.910
Lacking a little diversity,
if I'm being honest.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.739
But enjoy it.

31:11.782 --> 31:13.654
While you still can.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.322
How'd that go?

31:29.365 --> 31:30.540
He tell you what
we need to know?

31:30.584 --> 31:31.933
No. But he's about to.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.979
Johnny O's phone.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.719
Please don't tell me
you illegally cloned it.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.765
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.593
Trying to save lives,
not appear in court.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.377
Now, if I'm right,

31:41.421 --> 31:43.902
he's calling one of his hitters.

31:43.945 --> 31:46.165
Hello. We got a problem.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.776
I told you not to call me.
And never on this line.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.517
I know that voice.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.432
That's
Walter Ellis.

31:52.475 --> 31:53.912
The assistant district attorney.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.435
Sounds like there's history.

31:55.478 --> 31:56.958
Relax. I have
things under control.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.265
- Oh. That history.
Do you really?

31:59.308 --> 32:00.962
First the apartment gets got.

32:01.006 --> 32:03.965
Now I've got a woman coming
to my place, asking questions.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.272
She knows. If the D.A.'s probe

32:06.315 --> 32:07.795
gets to you, it'll get to me.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.057
And I can't have that.

32:09.101 --> 32:11.451
Your job is to keep me out
of prison.

32:11.494 --> 32:14.628
I've paid you a fortune over the
years to handle things your way.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.935
Don't make me handle things
my way.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.720
Don't worry. Whoever this woman
is, she's too late.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.635
We're moving on
to our backup plan.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.811
It'll all be over in an hour.

32:25.552 --> 32:28.859
Better hurry or we're gonna be
late for the press conference.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.253
Let's go, Jimmy.

32:31.297 --> 32:33.603
Change of plans, Jimmy.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.823
What the hell?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.093
I should've knocked his teeth
out when I had the chance.

32:47.356 --> 32:48.967
What do you got?

32:49.010 --> 32:50.620
We're tracking
Ellis's phone.

32:50.664 --> 32:54.276
Looks like he's heading south
near the warehouse district.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.756
Tracking Ellis's phone.

32:55.799 --> 32:57.018
- Head south.
- That's the opposite direction

32:57.062 --> 32:58.541
- from city hall.
- I told you.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.630
They aren't going
to the press conference.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.371
They're flipping the script.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.286
- I'm calling for backup.
- Don't.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.985
We need a scalpel, not a hammer.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.334
Nobody knows she's missing yet.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.989
A show of force will
only escalate the situation

33:11.032 --> 33:12.947
and put 'em both
in more danger.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.996
I always knew there was
something rotten in the office.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.302
But I have to admit,
I didn't think it was you.

33:20.346 --> 33:21.651
Though I always knew
you were an ass.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.001
Feeling's mutual.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.306
From the day you showed up,
you walked around

33:24.350 --> 33:25.351
like you were better
than everyone.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.353
Not everyone, Ellis.
Just you.

33:30.269 --> 33:31.748
Why is she here?

33:31.792 --> 33:33.533
So you can shoot her.

33:33.576 --> 33:34.708
Mitch Soraci?

33:35.535 --> 33:37.145
Johnny O's lapdog.

33:37.189 --> 33:40.061
That's how Johnny O's evaded
prosecution for so long.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.628
How much is he paying you
to steer cases?

33:41.671 --> 33:43.021
A lot more than you.

33:43.064 --> 33:44.935
You really think
you're gonna get away with this?

33:44.979 --> 33:48.026
Yeah. And after I do, I'm gonna
point this corruption scandal

33:48.069 --> 33:49.027
right back at you.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.376
Fact you'll be dead

33:50.419 --> 33:51.377
just makes it easier.

33:53.466 --> 33:54.858
What are you...

33:54.902 --> 33:56.686
what are you d--
- what are you doing?
- Take it.

33:57.252 --> 33:58.949
Look at her.

33:59.863 --> 34:00.864
That's the woman
who allowed your son

34:00.908 --> 34:02.344
to be brutalized to the point

34:02.388 --> 34:03.432
he tried to take his own life.

34:03.476 --> 34:04.912
She told you

34:04.955 --> 34:06.696
it was all
in the name of justice.

34:07.828 --> 34:10.004
Well, you taking her life--

34:10.048 --> 34:11.440
that's justice.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.184
That's vengeance,

34:16.228 --> 34:17.707
not justice.

34:17.751 --> 34:19.057
My son

34:19.100 --> 34:20.406
doesn't deserve to die.

34:22.669 --> 34:24.062
But neither does she.

34:26.238 --> 34:27.543
Just make him.

34:27.587 --> 34:28.936
Got her driver
in the trunk.

34:28.979 --> 34:30.720
We got to do
him next.

34:30.764 --> 34:34.289
Relax. Just need some powder
residue for the coroner.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.856
Gun down! Now!

34:49.130 --> 34:51.089
Toss the weapons or she dies!

34:51.132 --> 34:52.394
It's not gonna happen!

34:52.438 --> 34:54.222
It's over, Ellis! Let her go!

34:54.266 --> 34:55.484
No.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.104
You're right.

35:07.279 --> 35:08.149
The gears of justice

35:08.193 --> 35:09.368
are too slow for me.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.587
Or how'd you put it?

35:11.631 --> 35:12.893
"Thorough."

35:13.807 --> 35:16.288
I got a feeling they're gonna be
a little extra...

35:16.331 --> 35:17.419
thorough...

35:17.463 --> 35:18.725
...for you.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.819
Thank you.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.648
My son Luis?

35:28.691 --> 35:30.432
He's awake and he's stable.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.877
Thanks for trusting me.

35:43.358 --> 35:45.230
Deal's a deal.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.848
Nice elbow.

35:55.675 --> 35:57.633
Sometimes you got
to handle things yourself.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.592
Kind of my motto.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.029
We have laws for a reason.

36:02.856 --> 36:04.814
Without them,
we devolve into chaos.

36:04.858 --> 36:07.643
Well, clearly the law
isn't always enough.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.385
What happens then?

36:25.400 --> 36:26.923
Dante. Keys?

36:33.365 --> 36:36.672
I'm not saying I approve
of your methods.

36:36.716 --> 36:39.022
But I'm gonna look past it.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.546
For now.

36:43.418 --> 36:44.898
Thank you.

36:46.291 --> 36:47.814
Happy to help.

37:01.741 --> 37:04.526
You must be pretty pleased
with yourself.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.093
The vigilante's gone.

37:06.136 --> 37:09.488
And, miraculously, there's
no trace of her arrest record.

37:09.531 --> 37:12.012
I can't believe
she got the drop on me.

37:12.055 --> 37:13.100
Again.

37:13.143 --> 37:15.189
Whatever, Dante.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.973
I just got word.

37:17.017 --> 37:19.237
I'm being transferred
with a promotion.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.629
Good for you. You earned it.

37:20.673 --> 37:22.631
You and I both know
it's a bribe to go away.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.067
I know the D.A.'s behind this.

37:24.111 --> 37:25.547
She's the one
who pulled me off the case.

37:27.767 --> 37:29.856
I'll miss you, Mallory.

37:29.899 --> 37:32.250
Thanks again
for all the hunting tips.

37:32.293 --> 37:33.860
That's funny.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.430
Here's another one.

37:39.344 --> 37:40.910
You keep working
with that woman,

37:40.954 --> 37:42.999
and, I assure you,
it's gonna end badly.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.264
Maybe in a cell,

37:46.307 --> 37:47.830

So happy
you're okay. Oh.

39:15.701 --> 39:18.399
I-I'm sorry.
I don't want to interrupt.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.183
- I can come back.
- No, no.

39:20.227 --> 39:21.881
No, please.
It's okay.

39:22.708 --> 39:25.232
I wanted to tell you personally
that...

39:25.275 --> 39:28.017
the charges against Luis are in
the process of being dismissed.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.107
I looked into the case.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.196
I saw the video.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.416
And you
were right.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.504
We are part of the problem.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.943
You never should have been
arrested in the first place.

39:40.987 --> 39:42.380
Sometimes the system
can be faulty.

39:42.423 --> 39:46.035
And the wrong people
get hurt.

39:46.079 --> 39:48.429
It's never what we intend.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.040
In light of this case,
I'm, uh, asking my department

39:51.084 --> 39:52.868
to do a full review
of similar cases

39:52.912 --> 39:54.653
to prevent this
from happening again.

40:04.097 --> 40:05.881
Hold on a sec. Let me
get this straight.

40:05.925 --> 40:07.361
There's a truce
between you and the D.A.?

40:07.405 --> 40:10.495
More or less. She
won't actively pursue me

40:10.538 --> 40:12.148
as long as I don't go too far.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.585
Have you met yourself?

40:13.628 --> 40:15.064
"Too far" is kind
of your brand.

40:15.108 --> 40:16.892
Well, I don't know.

40:16.936 --> 40:18.764
She's holding up
her end of the deal.

40:18.807 --> 40:21.723
You are completely wiped
from the NYPD system.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.551
Great.

40:23.595 --> 40:26.728
But what I want to know is
what happened to your hand.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.252
Oh, this?

40:29.296 --> 40:30.906
Well, mm, let's just say

40:30.950 --> 40:32.473
that when you're,
uh, kicking ass,

40:32.517 --> 40:34.040
you got to break
a few eggs.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.085
Or bones, as the case may be.

40:37.304 --> 40:38.174
I'm not surprised.

40:38.218 --> 40:39.132
You always did have the hands.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.438
Mm-hmm.

40:40.481 --> 40:41.613
He was kind of a badass.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.528
Got to do what I got to do

40:43.571 --> 40:44.485
to protect
my lady.

40:44.529 --> 40:45.617
Oh, is that right?

40:45.660 --> 40:46.922
Oh.

40:46.966 --> 40:48.837
Well, I'm glad
you guys are great.

40:49.708 --> 40:52.580
I... got to get home.

41:05.854 --> 41:08.596
Well, well, well,

41:08.640 --> 41:10.511
if it isn't the jailbird.

41:11.947 --> 41:13.122
You want some
of this wine

41:13.166 --> 41:14.602
or do you prefer
to have yours made

41:14.646 --> 41:16.082
in a toilet?

41:16.125 --> 41:18.171
Aunt Vi.
- Mom! You're home!

41:18.214 --> 41:21.087
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I've been
in a filthy cell all day.

41:21.130 --> 41:23.132
Might want to let me
take a shower first.

41:23.176 --> 41:24.960
That is fair.

41:25.004 --> 41:26.919
Hold up.
Where's your ankle bracelet?

41:26.962 --> 41:28.398
Aren't you on house arrest?

41:28.442 --> 41:29.443
Okay,

41:29.487 --> 41:30.357
you two,

41:30.400 --> 41:31.619
y'all got jokes tonight.

41:35.362 --> 41:36.972
You can kid all you want.

41:37.930 --> 41:39.801
But I know you were worried.

41:39.845 --> 41:41.368
And I'm sorry.

41:41.411 --> 41:43.326
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:43.370 --> 41:44.806
I'm fine now.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.982
But...

41:47.026 --> 41:49.898
you'll tell us when you're
in real trouble, right?

41:49.942 --> 41:52.988
And if you are,

41:53.032 --> 41:55.251
you got to tell us
how we can help.

41:56.644 --> 41:58.341
I'll work on that.

42:01.736 --> 42:03.172
We can still
do game night.

42:03.216 --> 42:05.566
Okay, how 'bout
a movie instead?

42:05.610 --> 42:07.002
Love that idea.

42:07.046 --> 42:08.787
All right.

42:08.830 --> 42:10.789
- I'll get the snacks.
- Okay.

42:16.838 --> 42:18.057
Oh, yeah. For sure.

42:18.100 --> 42:20.538
Girl, let me get you a glass.

42:20.581 --> 42:22.191
Lord.

42:22.235 --> 42:23.715
Auntie.

42:29.895 --> 42:33.072
And don't you even think
about touching my glass.
