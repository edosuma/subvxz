00:01.740 --> 00:04.376
(Finch)
You are being watched.

00:04.378 --> 00:06.643
The government
has a secret system--

00:06.645 --> 00:11.282
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:11.284 --> 00:13.451
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:13.453 --> 00:15.319
but it sees everything...

00:15.321 --> 00:18.722
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.724 --> 00:21.792
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.794 --> 00:23.827
We don't.

00:23.829 --> 00:28.632
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.634 --> 00:30.701
You will never find us.

00:30.703 --> 00:32.769
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.771 --> 00:35.839
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:44.616 --> 00:45.816
Is it just me,
or is it getting harder

00:45.818 --> 00:48.319
to tell these tourists apart?

00:48.321 --> 00:51.355
Don't appreciate
visitors, Shaw?

00:51.357 --> 00:54.625
I don't appreciate
their fanny packs.

00:54.627 --> 00:59.296
Pretty handy
for concealing a grenade.

00:59.298 --> 01:01.498
Taxi!

01:01.500 --> 01:03.667
<i>(Shaw) Got eyes on
our number, Finch.</i>

01:03.669 --> 01:06.002
Leona Wainwright,
clerical assistant

01:06.004 --> 01:07.771
in the office
of personnel management.

01:07.773 --> 01:10.240
The OPM manages everything
<i>from background checks</i>

01:10.242 --> 01:11.908
<i>to pension benefits.</i>

01:11.910 --> 01:14.497
Federal.
So Leona lives in DC.

01:14.604 --> 01:16.874
She's in town
to see a Broadway show.

01:17.055 --> 01:18.577
Is that why
you had us dress up, Harold?

01:18.675 --> 01:20.629
An evening at the theater?

01:20.735 --> 01:21.980
(Finch) If you keep an
open mind, Miss Shaw,

01:22.051 --> 01:23.567
you might
actually enjoy yourself.

01:23.669 --> 01:24.923
(Shaw)
What's the show?

01:25.802 --> 01:27.494
<i>Mamma Mia.</i>

01:31.829 --> 01:33.329
<i>(Shaw) Whose turn is
it to save this one?</i>

01:33.331 --> 01:34.330
Let's flip for it.

01:34.332 --> 01:35.865
Heads.

01:38.469 --> 01:41.003
Guess it's your turn.

01:49.043 --> 01:51.812
Leona's cab hasn't moved.

01:51.814 --> 01:55.983
<i>Medallion number</i>
<i>two, X-ray, zero, three.</i>

01:55.985 --> 01:59.854
<i>(Finch) That number is registered
to a Mr. Sanjeev Verma.</i>

01:59.856 --> 02:01.789
Doesn't look
like a Sanjeev to me.

02:01.791 --> 02:04.157
Shaw, I'm gonna
need your help now.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.428
Say the name.

02:08.430 --> 02:10.597
<i>[Leona, muffled response]</i>

02:15.436 --> 02:17.037
[Boom]

02:21.341 --> 02:23.543

<i>Mr. Reese? Where's Leona?</i>

02:38.592 --> 02:41.193
[Garbled voices, static]

02:44.431 --> 02:47.766
(Reese)
Sorry, Finch.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.272
Neither of you
could have predicted

02:54.274 --> 02:55.907
that the threat
to Ms. Wainwright

02:55.909 --> 02:59.510
was so... immediate.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.379
The cellular phone
you retrieved

03:01.381 --> 03:03.448
was activated yesterday.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.751
It was registered
to one Jonathan Plowman, Junior.

03:06.753 --> 03:09.420
I'm guessing that's not
the cabbie's real name.

03:09.422 --> 03:10.855
Correct.
Jonathan Plowman, Junior

03:10.857 --> 03:12.923
did not drive a taxi.

03:12.925 --> 03:15.460
He was a spy for the Americans
in the Revolutionary War.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.395
So Vigilance killed Leona.

03:17.397 --> 03:18.929
What information
could Leona have

03:18.931 --> 03:20.365
that Vigilance wanted?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.367
Ms. Wainwright
worked for the government,

03:22.369 --> 03:23.634
and Vigilance has sworn to end

03:23.636 --> 03:26.937
the government's
abuse of privacy.

03:26.939 --> 03:29.139
I'm afraid
this is about the machine.

03:32.076 --> 03:34.344
[Phone rings]

03:34.346 --> 03:36.713
Hey, I just got
to the crime scene,

03:36.715 --> 03:39.283
and I'm not the only one.
Feds decided to drop by too.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.051
<i>(Reese) I'm sure you'll
charm them, Lionel.</i>

03:41.053 --> 03:43.119
I already tried.

03:43.121 --> 03:44.587
<i>These suits aren't letting me</i>

03:44.589 --> 03:46.956
<i>within a mile</i>
<i>of their investigation.</i>

03:48.425 --> 03:51.728
Augusta King,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.229
Give me a break.

03:53.231 --> 03:55.098
Lionel, you don't
want to be uncooperative

03:55.100 --> 03:57.000
with a federal agent.

03:57.002 --> 03:58.834
You're involved? I don't
want nothin' to do with this.

03:58.836 --> 04:00.503
Too late.

04:00.505 --> 04:02.771
One of Leona Wainwright's
many responsibilities

04:02.773 --> 04:04.707
in the office
of personnel management

04:04.709 --> 04:06.375
was security clearances.

04:06.377 --> 04:08.377
Security clearances?

04:08.379 --> 04:10.179
- What for?
- She hasn't told me yet.

04:10.181 --> 04:13.516
Either way,
you need to be careful.

04:13.518 --> 04:14.850
Yeah, no problem.

Senator... it's so good
to see you.

04:32.202 --> 04:33.468
<i>The SecDef</i>
<i>wasn't expecting you--</i>

04:33.470 --> 04:36.070
I'm not here to see him.

04:42.077 --> 04:43.411
Senator Garrison.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.846
I don't expect you're here

04:44.848 --> 04:48.049
to discuss
the DOD's budget. Tea?

04:48.051 --> 04:49.516
I'm assuming
you've heard about the woman

04:49.518 --> 04:52.419
who died a very
theatrical death in New York.

04:52.421 --> 04:54.555
Privacy terrorists.

04:54.557 --> 04:56.124
They call themselves Vigilance.

04:56.126 --> 04:57.491
They do like
to make a statement.

04:57.493 --> 04:59.093
Do they have our names?

04:59.095 --> 05:00.795
Has the program
been compromised?

05:00.797 --> 05:03.564
It's possible,
but I won't know for sure

05:03.566 --> 05:06.367
until we get access
to Leona Wainwright's office.

05:06.369 --> 05:08.168
If anyone
finds out about the system...

05:08.170 --> 05:09.470
They won't.

05:09.472 --> 05:11.505
How can you be so sure?

05:11.507 --> 05:15.242
You lost the thing months ago.

05:15.244 --> 05:17.344
Need I remind you

05:17.346 --> 05:19.513
of the number of terrorist acts

05:19.515 --> 05:21.948
that Northern Lights
has prevented?

05:21.950 --> 05:24.050
I think we both know

05:24.052 --> 05:25.652
that you
and your fellow congressmen

05:25.654 --> 05:27.387
would all be
giving guest lectures

05:27.389 --> 05:28.789
at second-tier universities

05:28.791 --> 05:32.392
if another attack
happened on our soil.

05:32.394 --> 05:35.162
So why don't you

05:35.164 --> 05:37.830
do everybody a favor

05:37.832 --> 05:40.866
and just leave
the heavy lifting to me,

05:40.868 --> 05:43.135
like you always do?

05:43.137 --> 05:45.638
By heavy lifting,
you mean sending your goons

05:45.640 --> 05:48.274
and their black bags
into that woman's office?

05:48.276 --> 05:50.310
Do you want me to answer that?

05:50.312 --> 05:51.911
The feds are already involved,

05:51.913 --> 05:55.314
which means we need
to go through official channels.

05:55.316 --> 05:57.316
If this comes back on us,

05:57.318 --> 06:01.320
prison will be
the least of our worries.

Matthew Reed,
criminal prosecutor

06:12.265 --> 06:14.700
in the Manhattan
District Attorney's office.

06:14.702 --> 06:17.402
How's a criminal prosecutor
connected to Vigilance?

06:17.404 --> 06:19.170
He's not, as far as I can tell.

06:19.172 --> 06:20.806
So why are
we going to Westchester?

06:20.808 --> 06:22.941
Because Mr. Reed will be
spending the weekend there,

06:22.943 --> 06:24.976
as will you
and Ms. Shaw.

06:24.978 --> 06:26.645
Your covers.

06:26.647 --> 06:29.113
Ms. Shaw will be
Betty Harris of Queens,

06:29.115 --> 06:30.648
and you, Mr. Reese,

06:30.650 --> 06:33.584
will be Frank Mercer
of Kenosha, Wisconsin.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.486
Shouldn't we be looking
into what information

06:35.488 --> 06:37.355
Leona gave to Vigilance?

06:37.357 --> 06:40.291
You can leave that to me.
I'll be traveling to DC.

06:40.293 --> 06:41.559
And we're not invited?

06:41.561 --> 06:42.894
It's important that we not let

<i>Mr. Reed</i>
<i>out of our sight.</i>

06:44.330 --> 06:47.931

losing another number.

Detective Fusco
has offered to accompany me.

06:50.503 --> 06:51.802
This trip to Westchester,

06:51.804 --> 06:54.338

of punishment?

[Door opens]

06:56.141 --> 06:58.075

08:10.537 --> 08:12.270
Weren't too popular

08:12.272 --> 08:13.906
You know, we have
more important things to do

at the bowling alley tonight,

the big shindig tomorrow.

09:04.257 --> 09:06.990
I hope you brought
your dancing shoes.

Right, Doug,

Let's see
how Harold did with me.

09:37.188 --> 09:39.289

made a clerical error.

Well, not to me.

09:46.298 --> 09:49.131

10:01.512 --> 10:04.346
Look, Ms. Harris
despised high school.

10:04.348 --> 10:06.348
She keeps a blog
enumerating the reasons

that she wouldn't be caught
dead at her 20-year reunion,

10:08.686 --> 10:11.052
so it's a fair assumption
that she would not show.

10:11.054 --> 10:12.921
I'm a professional blogger?
