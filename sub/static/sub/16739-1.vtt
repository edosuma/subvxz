00:18.560 --> 00:21.120
GPS locating Robosapien test run

00:21.280 --> 00:24.113
at 34 by 52 by 72.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.510
Robosapien test now in progress,

00:26.680 --> 00:29.148
T-minus three minutes, 26 seconds.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.919
Executive command, you have visual.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.514
Operation Robo Rescue
on your mark.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.678
Robo position...
100 yards from base.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.354
Come on, little buddy.
Make Daddy proud.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.679
Robosapien has reached
the perimeter of the base.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.830
Operation time, 5:52.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.558
On it, sir. On it.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.570
Sir, I'll be right there.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.677
Eagle One, proceed
to hangar seven-alpha.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.556
- Oops.

01:17.760 --> 01:18.910
Did you hear that?

01:18.920 --> 01:20.399
Move it to that carrier.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.231
What was that?

01:28.680 --> 01:30.113
...look on his face?

01:30.280 --> 01:32.630
He won't be doing that again.
No way.

01:32.640 --> 01:36.189
Whoa. Ai yi yi yi yi yi yi.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.033
Hmm? Ohh.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.078
Have no fear. Robosapien is here.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.450
Ooh, sorry. My bad.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.717
Robosapien has confirmed
location of target.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.239
We have a level-five security breach.

01:58.240 --> 02:01.550
- Repeat, level five...
- I think you've been detected.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.439
Please, don't hurt him.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.959
- All hands

02:04.960 --> 02:06.599
- to emergency stations.
- Hold on tight.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.759
I'm stronger than I look.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.591
Unauthorized chopper

02:09.759 --> 02:11.860
entering airspace at hangar seven.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.392
Run, run, run!

02:18.560 --> 02:19.879
Go! Jump!

02:20.040 --> 02:21.393
Yes.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.560
This is KT-1.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.239
Robo and rescue safe and secure.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.595
Heading back to Kinetech.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.911
Whoo-hoo!

02:32.200 --> 02:33.550
Mission accomplished.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.318
Robo out.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.439
They have Robosapien.
He's safe, sir.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.431
Good.
Robosapien, Admiral,

02:39.600 --> 02:42.170
can deliver everything
anywhere, anytime.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.479
It's an amazing piece
of technology, son,

02:45.480 --> 02:46.759
and it is going to revolutionize...

02:46.760 --> 02:47.959
- Nice going.
- ...search and rescue.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.719
Well, thank you so much, sir.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.119
I was a little nervous
giving him a test so soon.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.269
But it worked.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.959
You're a genius, Allan.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.999
So, Admiral, what does this all mean?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.839
Well, I need to head back to the base

02:58.840 --> 03:00.999
and deal with
a level-five security breach,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.230
and then I need to talk to the brass

03:03.280 --> 03:04.839
about buying your robots.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.752
Excellent.
So, Admiral, how long? How long...

03:07.920 --> 03:10.639
Ah, I'd say about six months.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.480
- It's exciting.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.113
Brace yourselves.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.190
You know this stuff takes time.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.918
WOMAN: Henry! Get a move on!
We'll be late!

03:34.080 --> 03:35.832
In a minute!

03:36.880 --> 03:39.599
- Weather.
- Good morning, Henry.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.671
Weirdo.
Look out the window.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.556
Align panel.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.154
Declination plus 28 degrees,

03:53.320 --> 03:54.799
42 minutes.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.718
Right ascension,

03:56.920 --> 03:59.195
eight hours, 13 minutes.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.159
I mean it! Hurry up!

04:02.160 --> 04:03.593
Henry!

04:03.800 --> 04:04.800
Okay, coming!

04:06.000 --> 04:07.353
Yeah.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.911
- Security mode.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.798
System armed.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.716
Remember, Mom,
the Science Bowl regionals, 5:00.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.995
Wait.
The regionals are today?

04:22.160 --> 04:24.390
You forgot.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.391
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.160
I got to work late today.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.274
That's okay.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.589
You know what?

04:31.760 --> 04:33.432
Maybe Meagan can go.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.953
Right.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.554
I'd rather throw up and die.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.996
- I'm sorry, honey,

04:41.160 --> 04:43.630
but I promise,
I'll be there next time.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.470
Come on, you guys.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.799
I hope we can fix my car

04:46.800 --> 04:48.599
this year, Mom.
No hood. No doors.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.079
It's so embarrassing.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.639
Henry, you're supposed to be
sweeping these leaves.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.239
I had to do the science project.
You know that.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.679
And, Meagan,
I told you to water these plants.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.359
Mom, they've been dead for,
like, a year.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.599
Yeah, well, they're dead
because you're not taking care of them.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.953
Yeah, I'm sure.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.678
Good morning, Loretta.

05:09.920 --> 05:11.639
You made that look easy.

05:11.640 --> 05:15.150
All right, keep your eyes on the road.
Let's go. Come on.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.330
Hey, don't forget
your science project.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.797
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetheart.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.076
I know you're going to do great.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.673
Good luck.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.030
- You're going to need it.
- Meagan.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.512
Yawn...
oxygen intake.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.557
Virtual signs show fatigue.

05:52.720 --> 05:53.919
Brain function slowing.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.300
You are tired, Allan.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.279
Yes, I am, and thank you
for noticing.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.770
Do you require a caffeine fix?
Espresso?

05:59.920 --> 06:02.559
That, I do, little buddy.
Make it a double.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.913
Thank you. Whoa.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.559
You need a spouse, Allan.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.159
Statistics show that married men

06:07.160 --> 06:09.470
outsurvive single men
by four to one.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.119
Hey! And, hey, Robosapien,

06:11.120 --> 06:12.759
you might as well
go by lab seven

06:12.760 --> 06:14.399
and have them change
your ball bearings.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.479
Right after I get the 411
on that new receptionist.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.480
No problemo.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.799
Whoa. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.039
- Excuse me, Mr. Porter.
- "No problemo"?

06:22.040 --> 06:23.370
- Mr. Porter.
- Allan.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.879
- You're just in time.
- What for?

06:24.880 --> 06:26.519
In every single department,

06:26.520 --> 06:29.717
Robosapien exceeded
our own expectations.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.810
His new artificial intelligence

06:31.880 --> 06:34.790
allows him to maximize
his initial programming.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.678
See, increases his ability

06:37.840 --> 06:40.638
to learn from his environment.

06:40.800 --> 06:44.634
Robosapien can
rationalize human emotion.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.116
He is learning to feel.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.555
Allan, it's a robot.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.433
We don't need it to feel.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.029
- No feely-feely.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.519
We'll continue this conversation later.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.078
Yeah. Niles Porter.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.620
- But you...
- Uh-huh.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.432
Looking good, Sarah.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.919
Good morning, Robosapien.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.439
Hey, hey.
It's my man Tony.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.719
You're looking
especially shiny today, Robo.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.358
Hey. ¿Cómo estás, Raul?

07:10.520 --> 07:12.988
Muy bien.
¿Y tú, Robosapien?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.759
No complaints here, amigo.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.639
- Pow!
- Pow!

07:19.800 --> 07:21.313
Sweet.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.195
Hey, Carol.
You free Saturday?

07:26.360 --> 07:27.860
Allan's got an opening.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.233
Kinetech Industries,

07:29.400 --> 07:31.759
the world's leader
in robotic research,

07:31.760 --> 07:34.558
is proud to introduce
Robosapien,

07:34.760 --> 07:38.070
a fully integrated
search-and-rescue technowonder.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.789
The supermobile Robosapien
can travel the world,

07:41.960 --> 07:44.599
bringing food,
resources, first aid,

07:44.760 --> 07:46.512
and anything necessary

07:46.680 --> 07:48.799
to help the masses
in their time of need.

07:48.800 --> 07:51.633
Kinetech's Robosapien
is preprogrammed

07:51.800 --> 07:55.349
in all aspects of global
search and rescue.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.719
Now just imagine

07:58.880 --> 08:02.077
when we command it
for search and destroy.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.799
Instead of medicine,
it will now carry nerve gas

08:04.800 --> 08:06.470
or maybe a nuclear weapon.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.033
Interesting.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.220
When can I have a demonstration?

08:37.440 --> 08:40.159
Now this is our
first waterproof model, Esperanza,

08:40.159 --> 08:41.479
very rudimentary.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.159
Just activate it, Porter.

08:43.159 --> 08:44.830
Yes, of course.
Of course.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.158
Command...
search and destroy.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.672
Here we go.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.410
Robo is turbo-swimming
to the boat.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.790
The bomb's been placed.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.190
He's returning safely to shore.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.277
Five, four,

09:09.480 --> 09:11.391
three, two, one.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.914
- Impressive.
- I know.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.310
I'll place an order for 100.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.530
- When will they be ready?
- At the end of the week.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.599
- A down payment.
- Sure.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.192
75 million as agreed,

09:39.360 --> 09:42.909
with the remainder upon
a final demonstration.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.274
Good.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.879
What? What happened?

09:47.040 --> 09:48.559
Hey, is everyone all right?

09:48.560 --> 09:50.630
Everybody's fine!

09:50.800 --> 09:52.039
It was a little test.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.393
This is Allan Topher,

09:53.560 --> 09:55.559
the creator of Robosapien down there.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.320
Congratulations, Mr. Topher.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.359
You have created
an amazing weapon.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.599
It will be a pleasure
doing business with you.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.999
- Porter, I'll be back...
- Thank you.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.300
- ...at the end of the week.
- See you.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.630
He said, "Weapon,"
Mr. Porter!

10:07.720 --> 10:09.079
It's not your concern, Allan.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.679
- It is my concern!
- No, it's not.

10:10.680 --> 10:12.199
What are you doing with Robosapien?

10:12.200 --> 10:13.839
I didn't design him to be a weapon.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.599
He's a search and rescue machine

10:15.600 --> 10:17.359
designed to save lives,
not destroy them.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.479
He's starting
to develop emotionally.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.994
It's a machine,
aluminum alloys.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.439
No, these are more
than a machine.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.639
- Little microchips.
- You don't understand.

10:24.640 --> 10:25.799
Tiny, little thingamabobbers.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.119
Have you ever just
looked into his optics?

10:28.120 --> 10:31.590
I am so tired of arguing with you.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.719
I'm not going to argue
with you anymore.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.315
- I'm letting you go.
- What?

10:37.480 --> 10:38.595
You're fired.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.839
Yeah. Clean out your desk.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.199
Thanks for coming.
Bye-bye.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.319
Go. Go. Erasers,
pencils, all of it.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.878
- Go on.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.196
I... oh.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.919
...solar system, Saturn,

11:14.920 --> 11:16.660
Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.549
- Nice solar system.
- Thanks.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.560
Did you know this one, Pluto,

11:24.680 --> 11:28.036
yeah, it's not a planet anymore.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.519
There's only eight.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.910
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.992
Eight, nine.
You know, you're close.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.439
I'll stick it back.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.828
Or not.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.430
Well, you did a really good job.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.670
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.870
What's this, Keller?

11:55.040 --> 11:58.510
- Well, it's a magnetic motor...
- Oops.

11:58.680 --> 12:00.159
- Whoa.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.833
Neanderthal.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.390
What was that, Keller?

12:04.520 --> 12:05.520
Nothing.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.272
That's what I thought.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.240
I saw what you did,
Warren.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.913
Disqualified.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.355
But, Mrs. Jacobs,
I didn't...

12:21.400 --> 12:23.300
Well, what we got here,
Henry?

12:23.440 --> 12:27.035
Well, magnetic
and solar-powered motors.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.199
Alternative energy
will be the answer

12:29.200 --> 12:30.919
to the world's power shortage.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.592
Does it spew or blow up?

12:32.760 --> 12:34.273
No, neither.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.629
Okay.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.570
- Now, what did you say it was again?
- Well...

12:39.320 --> 12:41.039
Escort Topher out of the building

12:41.040 --> 12:43.330
and don't let him out of your sight.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.359
And...

12:49.520 --> 12:52.876
it's just my succulents.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.749
Just going to log out.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.231
You want a donut?

13:17.520 --> 13:19.238
New hairstyle, lipstick,

13:19.440 --> 13:20.919
eye shadow, likes long walks.

13:20.920 --> 13:23.199
Allan says you're the prettiest thing

13:23.200 --> 13:25.079
to grace these halls
since I was a microchip.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.071
- Allan?
- Yeah, baby.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.759
Hot. Tsst!

13:28.920 --> 13:30.880
You're beautiful.
He's smart.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.560
You two are platform compatible.

13:33.720 --> 13:34.720
Really?

13:34.880 --> 13:37.314
What do you say?
Friday night at 8:00?

13:40.840 --> 13:43.035
- Oh, no.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.839
- That is my...

13:44.840 --> 13:47.434
- Get off me.
- Topher!

13:47.600 --> 13:49.439
Topher, you're going to burn for this.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.959
Dinah was just talking about you.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.119
- Hi, Allan.
- Oh, hi, Dinah.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.039
Sorry to interrupt.
Come on, let's go.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.799
She's free Friday night.
Where are you going?

13:55.800 --> 13:57.279
I don't know.
Come on. Come on.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.679
- Why are you panicking?
- Get out!

13:58.680 --> 14:01.114
It is just a date.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.159
Dang it!
Where's Allan Topher?

14:03.160 --> 14:05.390
- Allan?
- Geek with the robot.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.719
- That way.
- Come on.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.239
Make sure you check
the parking lot.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.913
- He couldn't have gone far.
- Yes, sir.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.917
Men, catch this guy.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.479
Units four and five, close off...

14:14.480 --> 14:16.519
Make sure you get that robot too.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.530
Let's get 'em on perimeter one.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.919
Allan Topher slipped by, sir.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.839
Robosapien's confirmed missing.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.831
Then find him. Now!

14:37.680 --> 14:38.999
Hey, Henry.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.832
Congratulations, buddy.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.672
- Thanks.
- Dude, let's go.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.300
I want to grab a slice
before I go home.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.599
First place.

14:50.760 --> 14:54.380
Wow. Now you've got a trophy
to prove what a loser you are.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.639
Can I have it back?
Please?

14:55.640 --> 14:57.995
- Right here.
- Loser.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.639
- Seriously.
- Come on, Dirk.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.599
Don't you want to be
just as cool as Henry

15:01.600 --> 15:02.759
with his little dumb trophy?

15:02.760 --> 15:04.039
- Yeah, sure.
- Do you want it?

15:04.040 --> 15:05.268
Do you want it?

15:05.440 --> 15:06.639
Do you want it? Yeah?

15:08.160 --> 15:09.957
I'm sorry.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.710
I didn't do it on purpose.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.279
- Come on.
- You better run, Keller.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.410
You're getting such a beat-down.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.679
Allan, this is really proving pointless.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.010
I've tried eHarmony,

15:22.080 --> 15:23.479
- match.com.
- Okay!

15:23.640 --> 15:25.799
I don't know where else I can look.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.159
- Should we try OkCupid?
- Oh, boy.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.673
Rapid breathing...

15:28.840 --> 15:30.359
- Now go.
- ...elevated heart rate,

15:30.360 --> 15:31.839
excessive perspiration.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.359
- Allan, are you all right?
- Hey, Robosapien,

15:33.360 --> 15:35.500
- is your GPS on?
- Negative, Allan.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.034
Hey, listen.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.872
We're in danger, okay?

15:40.080 --> 15:41.999
Danger? Like,
"Danger, nerd crossing,"

15:42.000 --> 15:44.239
- or "Danger, fart zone"?

15:44.240 --> 15:47.073
No, like serious danger, okay?

15:47.240 --> 15:49.390
Okay.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.913
Scan my badge.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.672
Of course, Allan.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.512
Optical scan complete.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.500
Now, when you see this logo,

15:56.640 --> 15:58.119
what are you going to do?

15:58.120 --> 15:59.800
- Say, "Good morning."
- No!

15:59.880 --> 16:03.079
- Say, "Good night"?
- You're going to run like mad, okay?

16:03.080 --> 16:04.638
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.039
- Okay, shoes for me.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.479
I got an extra battery for you,

16:07.480 --> 16:09.079
and I'm going to put some other stuff

16:09.080 --> 16:11.759
that you might need, may not need,
but if you don't need it,

16:11.760 --> 16:13.199
then you just take it with you.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.599
Kinetech. Uh-oh.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.716
What? What?
What'd you say?

16:16.880 --> 16:19.799
Allan, does this mean
we should start running now?

16:19.800 --> 16:22.230
- Open up right now!

16:22.960 --> 16:24.199
- There he is!

16:24.200 --> 16:26.039
Come on, let's go.
There he is.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.190
Get to the window.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.315
Hurry up!

16:29.880 --> 16:30.995
Open up!

16:32.360 --> 16:34.715
- Open... wait.
- I activated your GPS,

16:34.880 --> 16:37.159
so if we get separated,
I can find you.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.479
Don't make me go.
I want to stay with you.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.833
Now you got to go.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.239
Grab ahold of the pipe.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.319
- Come with me.
- Good. You're good. You're good.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.548
Grab ahold of it.

16:45.720 --> 16:46.959
You've got to keep going.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.119
- Come on, please.
- Just go!

16:48.120 --> 16:49.599
- Go! Go!
- Come on, there he is.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.272
I will find you! Go!

16:51.440 --> 16:53.032
Get out of the way.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.753
- I got him!
- Ow!

16:54.920 --> 16:57.673
He's going up the roof.
Go, go, go!

16:57.840 --> 17:00.195
No! No!

17:00.360 --> 17:01.740
You'll never get him!

17:01.880 --> 17:04.069
You'll never take him away from me!

17:04.160 --> 17:05.912
Danger! Danger!

17:06.079 --> 17:08.310
Evade! Evade!

17:10.000 --> 17:12.239
We have a visual.
Target is on the roof.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.832
Kinetech.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.490
What's going on?

17:17.560 --> 17:18.999
Don't make this more difficult

17:19.000 --> 17:20.592
than it has to be, robot.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.590
Kinetech.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.035
Run like mad.
Stop! Stop!

17:27.000 --> 17:28.558
Ow! Stop it!

17:28.720 --> 17:31.260
What are you doing?
It's me, Robosapien.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.998
What did I do?

17:34.160 --> 17:36.037
Stop!
What did I do?

17:36.240 --> 17:38.196
I'm sorry, whatever it was.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.920
Help me! Help!

17:41.120 --> 17:43.350
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.158
Allan!

17:59.040 --> 18:01.873
He can't be far.
Go. Go!

18:18.480 --> 18:20.550
Where'd he go?

18:20.720 --> 18:22.358
Where are you,
Keller?

18:22.520 --> 18:24.039
Come on out
wherever you are.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.395
We just want to talk.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.513
We won't hurt you, buddy.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.637
I bet I know where you are.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.150
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.032
Come on, dude.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.758
He's not here.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.399
You're dead meat, Keller!

18:41.400 --> 18:43.072
You hear me?!

19:29.160 --> 19:31.230
A micro...
ball bearing... help!

19:31.440 --> 19:32.919
- Help! Allan!

19:32.920 --> 19:35.434
- Fart zone. Buenos día...
- Help!

19:35.600 --> 19:37.158
Toasty. Circuit.
Zzzz.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.759
Scrambled eggs!

19:38.920 --> 19:40.759
You need a date.
Allan, help.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.591
Negative. Ow.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.233
Whoa.

20:13.440 --> 20:15.590
What are you, little guy?

20:48.440 --> 20:49.793
Check the Dumpster.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.550
Whoa.
Whoop! Whoop!

20:56.560 --> 20:58.790
Anything, James?

20:58.960 --> 21:00.996
Nothing, sir.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.810
Spread out.
He couldn't have gone too far.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.200
Henry, you seriously stink.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.517
- Intruder. Intruder.
- 749153.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.159
Security override.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.290
Honey, did I hear you come in?

21:31.240 --> 21:33.629
Oh, my gosh.
You won first place.

21:34.680 --> 21:35.680
Oh, my gosh.

21:35.840 --> 21:38.070
Oh, honey.

21:38.240 --> 21:39.434
Wow.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.909
Congratulations.

21:42.080 --> 21:43.672
I am so proud of you.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.717
Thanks, Mom.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.915
Honey, I think you need a bath.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.073
Please work.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.040
Kinetech means danger!
Kinetech means danger!

22:59.600 --> 23:00.669
Are you okay?

23:00.840 --> 23:02.839
Happy circuitses.
Double espresso.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.359
Good morning. Good night.
Good morning.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.191
Oh. Ah.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.430
Double espresso.
Cappuccino. Latte.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.238
- Hola!
- Shh. Keep quiet.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.517
- We need to hide you.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.719
Henry?

23:28.880 --> 23:31.553
Henry?
What happened?

23:31.760 --> 23:32.760
Yeah.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.751
- I...

23:34.920 --> 23:37.559
I had a really, really tough day.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.479
So you tore apart your room?

23:41.480 --> 23:43.038
Yeah.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.634
It's girl problems.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.559
Girl problems?

23:51.960 --> 23:54.793
Yeah, it's complicated.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.235
I don't want to talk about it.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.994
Maybe I can help.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.479
No, I'm good.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.551
I'll sort it out myself.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.915
And you're sure you're all right?

24:06.080 --> 24:08.359
Well, there was
a whole lot of cupcakes

24:08.360 --> 24:10.635
at the science fair,
really good.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.196
Maybe I had too much blood sugar.
Yeah.

24:14.360 --> 24:15.475
But I'm fine.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.716
Okay.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.348
Well, clean up this room...

24:20.560 --> 24:21.560
quietly.

24:21.720 --> 24:22.835
Okay.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.513
And go to bed.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.239
Mom, he is so weird.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.394
You are in a heap of trouble.

24:47.560 --> 24:50.870
We've got a $10 million
prototype missing.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.076
We have files

24:53.240 --> 24:55.519
that just disappeared
from this office.

24:55.520 --> 24:56.873
It's a mess.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.520
Then I think you better
call the police.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.997
Okay, Allan,

25:04.160 --> 25:07.072
Allan, Allan, how do you think

25:07.240 --> 25:09.439
we were going to pay
for Robosapien?

25:09.440 --> 25:12.039
Search and rescue
is a highly profitable application.

25:12.040 --> 25:15.396
Not as profitable
as search and destroy.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.359
Listen, Boy Scout,
we can have this both ways.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.476
If you've truly lost Robosapien,

25:21.640 --> 25:23.198
program another one...

25:23.360 --> 25:24.900
one for you, one for us.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.991
Never.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.515
He was like a son to you, wasn't he?

25:29.680 --> 25:31.599
You want that feeling
again, don't you?

25:31.600 --> 25:34.160
I've met your merchant of death.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.399
Because of people like him and you,

25:36.400 --> 25:38.439
I'll never make another Robosapien.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.119
You're making a big mistake.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.236
Big.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.674
Can I leave?

25:43.840 --> 25:46.035
Yeah.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.072
This is...

25:52.600 --> 25:55.512
...this is very,
very serious, Allan.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.679
I don't think you know
what you're involved in.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.557
If you leave this building,

25:59.720 --> 26:01.597
we can't protect you.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.115
These are very dangerous people.

26:10.680 --> 26:12.193
You got it.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.435
If I turn you on,

26:18.600 --> 26:20.720
will you go all nutso on me again?

26:22.400 --> 26:24.630
Well, here it goes.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.515
Hello.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.672
Do you understand me?

26:41.840 --> 26:44.673
Yes, I understand you.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.274
Why are you talking so slowly?

26:47.440 --> 26:49.749
My name's Henry.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.996
You're a boy, aren't you?

26:52.160 --> 26:54.820
My original prototype
was based upon a boy.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.309
I've never seen one up close before.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.710
Wow. Do you have a name?

26:59.880 --> 27:01.359
Name?
Trying to recall.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.959
Memory codes three through eight
are corrupted.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.791
Then what do I call you?

27:05.960 --> 27:07.530
Code three through eight.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.919
Three through...
hey, how 'bout Cody?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.195
Memory code.
Code. Cody.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.719
Cody. I like it.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.233
Where are we, Henry?

27:15.440 --> 27:16.839
This is my room.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.353
We're in my home.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.839
Home, sweet home.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.440
Where do you come from?

27:21.520 --> 27:22.900
Do you come from here?

27:22.960 --> 27:24.678
Here?
Home, sweet home?

27:25.760 --> 27:28.228
Are you a toy?
What are you?

27:28.400 --> 27:30.311
My memory codes tell me

27:30.480 --> 27:32.430
I am a search and rescue robot,

27:32.440 --> 27:35.432
but I don't remember
what that means.

28:03.320 --> 28:04.435
Cool optics.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
Oh, yes.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.639
My X-ray lenses
are Hubble series five,

28:07.640 --> 28:09.119
version 2.0.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.399
Careful.
Almost got you.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.550
Do you play games?

28:14.680 --> 28:17.460
Part of my primary
learning process is games.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.873
You like Simon Says?

28:19.040 --> 28:20.839
I love Simon Says.
Let's play.

28:20.840 --> 28:24.150
Simon says put
your hand on your head.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.719
Simon says touch your nose.

28:25.720 --> 28:26.720
Simon says...

28:26.880 --> 28:29.235
hop on one foot.

28:29.400 --> 28:30.879
Simon says bark like a dog.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.759
- Woof woof!

28:32.760 --> 28:35.228
Simon says sit in the chair.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.830
Spin the chair around.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.512
- Gotcha.

28:38.680 --> 28:39.999
Simon didn't say that.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.476
I like Simon Says.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.399
- That's so cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.919
- That was so much...
- Henry!

28:46.920 --> 28:48.433
I'm trying to sleep!

28:48.600 --> 28:50.260
Uh-oh.
Who's the female?

28:50.360 --> 28:51.839
My sister Meagan.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.959
Please, keep it down!

28:55.960 --> 28:57.837
Whoa. She's angry.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.079
- Yeah, she's always angry.
- Why?

29:00.080 --> 29:02.753
Mom says her hormones are raging.

29:02.920 --> 29:06.071
- What's that?
- I don't know. She's a teenager.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.835
- Why?
- Well, she gets mad

29:10.000 --> 29:11.911
when she doesn't get her way.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.355
- Why?
- She wants her own car,

29:14.560 --> 29:16.439
- but Mom won't buy her one.
- Why?

29:16.440 --> 29:17.839
Because we can't afford it.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.840
Why?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.559
You ask too many questions.

29:20.560 --> 29:22.198
Why? Why? Why?

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
Incoming.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.710
Whoa, frustration.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.639
You were angry with me, Henry.

29:27.640 --> 29:30.074
No, I'm not angry.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.879
Cody is programmed
to learn human interaction

29:32.880 --> 29:34.438
and human emotion.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.558
How 'bout the human need for sleep?

29:37.720 --> 29:40.553
Sleep, snooze, shut-eye.

29:40.720 --> 29:42.233
Cody understands.

29:44.840 --> 29:46.910
Good night, Henry.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.071
Good night, Cody.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.994
If you plug yourself
into the solar panel,

29:53.160 --> 29:56.072
you'll be charged in the morning.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.433
Man-to-man,

30:02.600 --> 30:04.679
your game got
no bandwidth, sucker.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.880
Your game got
no bandwidth, sucker.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.352
Holy guacamole.
So much data.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.639
Love the new power source, Henry.

30:30.640 --> 30:31.993
Solar power, cool.

30:32.160 --> 30:34.399
Vitamin D,
good for Cody's complexion.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.994
Okay, Cody,
I have to go to school.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.037
- School?
- So you stay here.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.650
School is for learning.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.239
You're staying right here.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.549
- Nope.
- What?

30:44.720 --> 30:46.312
No. Denied.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.118
Negative. Nuh-uh.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.359
What is it about no
you don't understand?

30:50.360 --> 30:52.920
- Hey! Give it back.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.678
Stop it. That's mine.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.439
- School is learning.
- Cody, give it back now.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.599
It's part of my programming.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.352
It's who I am, Henry.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.670
Hey, do you want to be turned off?

31:01.880 --> 31:04.235
No! Murder! Murder!

31:04.400 --> 31:05.719
Robot held captive

31:05.920 --> 31:08.119
- by human without proper education.
- Are you insane?

31:08.120 --> 31:09.920
- Get back!

31:10.040 --> 31:12.479
Cody wants to go to school!
Cody wants to go to school!

31:12.480 --> 31:13.679
- Cody, stop!
- Cody wants!

31:13.680 --> 31:14.919
- Cody wants!
- Stop it!

31:14.920 --> 31:16.439
Cody wants to go to school!

31:16.440 --> 31:18.795
- Okay, okay!
- Sorry, Henry.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.839
I just didn't want to be left behind.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.159
Okay, fine.

31:22.320 --> 31:24.276
But you got to do what I say.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.835
Yes! I'm going to school.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.159
I'm really going to school.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.479
When do we learn, Henry?

31:39.480 --> 31:40.674
Shh. Stop that.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.637
Shh.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.074
You made a dumb move

31:44.240 --> 31:45.399
coming in to school today.

31:45.400 --> 31:47.639
Warren, I'm sorry.
I really didn't...

31:47.640 --> 31:48.839
Just watch your back, Keller.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.592
Jerk. Oh, Teacher.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.394
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

31:53.560 --> 31:55.079
- I want to learn.
- Are you crazy?

31:55.080 --> 31:56.719
- Get back in there.
- I want to learn.

31:56.720 --> 31:57.959
- Come on. Stop it.
- Please, Henry.

31:57.960 --> 32:01.589
Can anyone tell me
what absolute zero refers to?

32:01.760 --> 32:03.039
- Oh, I know.
- I know.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.840
- Warren.
- Henry's nickname.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.839
If I recall, it's also the score

32:08.840 --> 32:10.439
to your last exam, Mr. Warren.

32:11.600 --> 32:12.749
Okay.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.751
Absolute zero.
Anyone?

32:14.920 --> 32:17.195
- Oh, me!
- Henry.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.799
Absolute zero refers to the temperature

32:19.800 --> 32:21.719
of a system that's thermically inert.

32:21.720 --> 32:23.711
In Celsius, it's measured

32:23.920 --> 32:27.469
at 273 degrees below zero.

32:27.640 --> 32:29.471
That was excellent.

32:29.640 --> 32:32.154
And the name of the scientist

32:32.320 --> 32:33.912
who discovered it is...

32:34.080 --> 32:35.839
- Ooh, me! Me, me, me, me!
- Me!

32:35.840 --> 32:39.071
Robert Boyle,
born January 25, 1627.

32:39.240 --> 32:40.759
- He was a chemist,

32:40.760 --> 32:42.319
- a physicist, and...
- Cody, no.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.072
What? What did Cody do?

32:44.240 --> 32:46.276
- Okay, okay.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.710
Settle down, kids.
Quiet, please.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.830
Show us what it can do, Keller.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.270
- Whoa.
- Oh, no.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.330
- Time to bust a move.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.276
Unh. Hey. Yeah.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.237
# 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 #

33:03.400 --> 33:05.479
# If you want
to see what I can do #

33:05.480 --> 33:07.755
# You just got to ask #

33:07.960 --> 33:09.350
# Burning up the floor #

33:09.480 --> 33:11.994
# 'Bout to ignite #

33:12.160 --> 33:13.599
# I have everything you need #

33:13.600 --> 33:15.909
- # But we got to be fast #
- Whoa.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.832
# My fears have gone away #

33:18.000 --> 33:19.274
# It's time to fly #

33:19.440 --> 33:20.634
# Can you move it? #

33:20.800 --> 33:22.719
- # Can you groove it? #
- # Yes, I can #

33:22.720 --> 33:24.559
- # Can you follow what I'm doing? #
- # Yes, I can #

33:24.560 --> 33:27.159
- # Can you scream, can you shout? #
- # Yes, I can #

33:27.160 --> 33:29.196
# 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 #

33:29.400 --> 33:30.999
- # This is the countdown #
- Yeah.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.180
# You know
I won't let you down... #

33:33.240 --> 33:35.913
Hey, Teacher,
shake a leg.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.560
- Yeah.
- # 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 #

33:37.720 --> 33:39.559
- # Yeah, this is the countdown #
- That's right.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.560
# You know I won't let you down #

33:41.640 --> 33:43.720
# Let's keep going another round #

33:43.800 --> 33:47.190
# Going to hit you
with the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. #

33:47.360 --> 33:50.352
Thank you. Thank you.
We'll be here all week.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.829
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.393
What?

33:56.800 --> 33:58.518
Go, robot.

33:58.720 --> 34:00.279
Take a look around, Henry.

34:00.280 --> 34:01.759
We've got a fan club.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.119
Gentlemen, please.
Please, make room.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.839
- Whoa.
- Hello, ladies.

34:20.639 --> 34:22.918
Involuntary response
of nervous system.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.799
- Rapid pulse rate.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.152
Ocular dilation.

34:26.320 --> 34:28.754
Hello. Hello. Henry.

34:28.960 --> 34:29.960
What?

34:30.120 --> 34:32.518
Cody's emotional sensor
registers attraction

34:32.520 --> 34:34.159
to that speckled girl
with orange hair.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.159
No.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.159
I wasn't assembled
yesterday, you know.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.159
Yes.

34:38.320 --> 34:41.190
I've had a crush on her
since the first grade.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.719
I like her lots,

34:42.880 --> 34:45.313
and I really want to ask her to go

34:45.520 --> 34:46.918
to the Spring Dance with me,

34:46.920 --> 34:49.353
but she wouldn't want to go with me.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.478
Do you have
a critical malfunction, Henry?

34:52.480 --> 34:55.630
Fear, dread, panic, chicken.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.399
I'm not a chicken.

34:58.560 --> 34:59.759
You should talk to Jenna.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.760
Interface.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.273
No way.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.319
I wouldn't even know what to say.

35:04.320 --> 35:05.639
Here. Wear this.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.550
Follow Cody's instructions.

35:07.560 --> 35:08.993
A Bluetooth?

35:09.160 --> 35:11.754
Trust Cody. I have a plan.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.290
- Henry?
- Okay, yeah.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.879
I can hear you.
But wait. She's coming.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.600
Okay, champ. It's go time.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.199
Introduce yourself.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.078
Hi. I'm Henry Keller.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.850
I know who you are, Henry.

35:24.880 --> 35:25.880
You do?

35:26.040 --> 35:27.359
Duh.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.559
Oh. Well, yeah.
Of course you do.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.839
Okay, stay with the program.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.119
Invite her to the dance.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.509
- Don't push me.
- Excuse me?

35:34.680 --> 35:36.910
Nothing. It's nothing.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.877
Oh, man.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.519
Are you okay?

35:40.680 --> 35:42.238
Yeah, I.. I'm fine.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.319
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay. Try this.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.835
I like the way your cheeks
flush when you laugh.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.554
I like how your cheeks flush...

35:50.720 --> 35:52.639
- When you laugh!
- ...when you laugh.

35:52.640 --> 35:58.636
Your heart rate
is 95 beats per minute.

35:58.840 --> 36:03.516
And I wish every beat was for me.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.870
Poetry.
I love poetry.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.239
Your hair, your posture, perfection.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.340
Your hair and posture, perfection.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.671
Your eyes deep and caring.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.593
Your nose, cold and wet.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.273
Wet nose?

36:18.440 --> 36:19.714
Like a dog?

36:19.880 --> 36:21.559
- Whoops. Wrong magazine.

36:21.560 --> 36:24.479
My bad. You have been preapproved
for a guaranteed grand prize.

36:24.480 --> 36:27.090
You have been preapproved
for a guaranteed

36:27.200 --> 36:29.690
- grand prize. Act now.
- Urgent! Act now!

36:29.760 --> 36:32.639
- Go to the dance with me.
- Go to the dance with me.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.830
I think you've said enough, Henry.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.195
Yeah, way to go, Romeo.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.392
Ow! What gives?!

36:41.560 --> 36:43.679
Until we can afford
to fix up your car,

36:43.680 --> 36:45.719
we have this car,
and you can help me out

36:45.720 --> 36:48.320
by running errands
or going to the market,

36:48.480 --> 36:50.639
helping me pick up
Henry from school.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.679
You just want me to get my license
so I could do your dirty work?

36:53.680 --> 36:55.519
Would it kill you to help me out?

36:55.520 --> 36:57.639
You always manage to take
the fun out of everything.

36:57.640 --> 36:58.730
That's not true.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.160
Oh, no?
Well, then, why did Dad leave?

37:21.520 --> 37:24.512
- Well?
- Sir, we've been monitoring Topher

37:24.720 --> 37:26.100
for the last 48 hours.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.519
He's had zero contact with the robot.

37:28.520 --> 37:30.159
Any sign of Robosapien on the GPS?

37:30.160 --> 37:31.479
No, sir.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.318
What is wrong with you?

37:33.520 --> 37:35.158
Robosapien is out there,

37:35.320 --> 37:37.709
so would you please find him?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.199
Henry?

37:39.400 --> 37:42.073
Can Cody meet your family now?

37:42.280 --> 37:43.872
I'll take that as a yes.

37:44.040 --> 37:46.190
Ha ha!
Now, let's see.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.998
What to do?
What to do?

37:56.280 --> 37:57.474
Hi. I'm Cody.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.599
- Oh. Oh, bubble girl. Run.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.875
- Henry...
- Not good.

38:05.040 --> 38:07.280
- ...I'm going to get you!
- Hide me.

38:07.440 --> 38:09.158
Henry, you little nerd.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.079
- What? What did I do?
- Where is it?

38:11.080 --> 38:12.399
Where's what?

38:12.600 --> 38:14.079
You know what I'm talking about.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.599
That little robotic snoop of yours.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.194
Okay, what's going on? Huh?

38:18.400 --> 38:19.679
One of Henry's crazy
science experiments

38:19.680 --> 38:22.433
came in and spied on me
in the bathroom.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.829
Henry Montgomery Keller...

38:26.000 --> 38:27.759
do you have something to tell me?

38:27.760 --> 38:29.876
Ah, Mom, sister Meagan.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.440
I don't believe we've met. I'm Cody.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.910
You guys should probably sit down.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.634
So, lovely ladies, what's shaking?

38:38.800 --> 38:43.476
Well, this is my friend Cody.

38:43.640 --> 38:45.639
Are your hormones
still raging, Meagan?

38:45.640 --> 38:47.250
You did not just say that.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.514
- Cody, no.
- What?

38:48.720 --> 38:51.188
Henry, where did you get Cody?

38:51.360 --> 38:53.078
I found him in the trash

38:53.240 --> 38:55.754
all messed up, so I fixed him.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.069
Henry, honey,

38:57.240 --> 39:00.391
people don't throw away
something like a Cody.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.278
But someone did.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.517
Cody, where did you come from?

39:05.680 --> 39:08.911
Data recall error 3401.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.196
- He doesn't know.
- Hmm.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.713
So can I keep him?

39:12.880 --> 39:15.474
Henry, I really don't...

39:15.640 --> 39:17.392
You look tense, Mom.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.994
- Ohh.
- May I?

39:20.160 --> 39:22.037
Oh.
Hello.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.111
Ah, magic fingers.

39:24.280 --> 39:25.519
- Ooh, yes.

39:25.520 --> 39:26.679
You're very tense.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.238
That feels incredible.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.753
Oh, my God.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.000
He's totally trying to bribe you.

39:32.160 --> 39:33.160
Totally lame.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.673
Relax, Meagan.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.319
There's plenty of Cody
to go around.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.580
- Oh.
- There you go.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.680
Wow.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.910
- Just relax.
- Oh, Henry.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.594
Oh. Wow.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.239
I think... oh, yeah.
Right there.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.159
- Right there.
- Oh, that feels like...

39:47.160 --> 39:48.679
Ah, yes,
you are very tense.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.199
You can keep him for now.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.792
Sweet. Really? Yes.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.837
Margaritas, anyone?

39:59.880 --> 40:02.713
# Yeah #

40:02.920 --> 40:05.036
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... #

40:05.200 --> 40:06.997
I want one!
I want one!

40:07.160 --> 40:09.390
I want it! I want one!
I want it!

40:10.520 --> 40:12.875
# Around me #

40:13.040 --> 40:17.716
# It's just another lonely afternoon #

40:19.160 --> 40:20.479
# I felt so lost #

40:20.640 --> 40:24.315
# Within this crowd of strangers #

40:24.520 --> 40:25.873
Hey. Wait.

40:26.040 --> 40:29.874
# Then I saw you
from across the room... #

40:30.040 --> 40:33.100
- Here. Take this.
- What'd you do that for, Henry?

40:33.200 --> 40:34.679
I don't know.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.956
# Took away the fear inside #

40:37.160 --> 40:40.038
# Made the day begin again #

40:40.200 --> 40:43.715
# Show me that the story
never ends #

40:43.920 --> 40:45.797
# Because of you... #

40:46.840 --> 40:48.432
Hey, what about me?

40:48.600 --> 40:49.999
I scream, you scream,

40:50.160 --> 40:51.639
we all scream for ice cream.

40:51.640 --> 40:53.919
- This'll be interesting.
- Oh, ice cream.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.751
Mmm. Pistachio,

40:55.920 --> 40:57.990
from the pistachio nut.

40:58.160 --> 40:59.679
- I scream. You scream.

40:59.680 --> 41:00.829
Mostly I scream.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.010
Oh.
Maybe I should have it back.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.758
Brain freeze!

41:08.680 --> 41:09.999
Check out my air,

41:10.160 --> 41:12.071
New Orleans!
Yeah!

41:12.280 --> 41:14.480
# The bumper sticker
on your car... #

41:14.520 --> 41:15.999
Follow me, Henry. I got an idea.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
Cody!

41:18.160 --> 41:19.639
- Whoa!
- Hold on a minute.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.159
Just what I was looking for.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.799
# Long, long way #

41:24.000 --> 41:26.195
# So get behind the wheel #

41:26.360 --> 41:28.237
# And take away my sadness... #

41:28.400 --> 41:29.719
Wow. Cool.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.880
Is there anything you can't do?

41:32.040 --> 41:33.758
# Behind and break away... #

41:33.920 --> 41:35.672
You got it. You got it.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.513
- Ow.
- You don't got it.

41:38.720 --> 41:41.792
# Clear the fog inside my head #

41:41.960 --> 41:43.279
Whoo-hoo!

41:43.440 --> 41:45.279
# Today's the day we begin again... #

41:45.280 --> 41:47.430
Hey, let me snap some pics, Henry.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.919
Say, "Cheese."

41:49.080 --> 41:50.798
# Because of you #

41:52.000 --> 41:53.558
# I'm flying high #

41:53.720 --> 41:55.676
Give me the 'tude.
Nice.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.319
- # No more darkness #

41:57.320 --> 42:01.108
# No more tears to cry #

42:01.280 --> 42:04.033
# Because of you... #

42:04.200 --> 42:07.556
And I can't believe
you have a built-in blowtorch.

42:07.720 --> 42:10.553
Cody, this has been
the best day ever.

42:10.720 --> 42:14.998
Kids at school actually like me,
thanks to you.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.340
I think we make
a good team, Henry.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.749
It's good to have
someone to talk to

42:19.920 --> 42:22.354
and just laugh with, you know?

42:22.560 --> 42:24.994
Yeah, I do know.

42:36.480 --> 42:39.313
Robo. Where are you, buddy?

42:39.480 --> 42:41.559
My mom and I had a huge fight today.

42:41.560 --> 42:42.879
I don't get it.

42:43.080 --> 42:45.279
Why can't she talk
to me instead of at me?

42:45.280 --> 42:48.440
I just wish she'd treat me
like an adult, you know?

42:52.680 --> 42:55.790
Hey, Mom, Meagan wants to talk
to you for a minute.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.079
I swear she makes the stuff up.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.513
Ahem.

43:03.720 --> 43:06.712
Hey, Stacey, can I call you back?

43:11.200 --> 43:12.633
Do you need something?

43:13.720 --> 43:14.755
No.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.956
Oh.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.951
All right. Well...

43:19.120 --> 43:22.192
- good night.
- Wait. Mom.

43:24.640 --> 43:26.880
I'm really sorry about what I said.

43:28.160 --> 43:31.340
Totally didn't mean that comment
about you and Dad.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.350
- It's fine.
- No.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.590
Dad was such a jerk.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.279
I mean, even when he was here,

43:40.280 --> 43:42.239
he was never really here for us,

43:42.240 --> 43:43.753
not like you are.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.912
You're totally fun.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.909
No, I'm not.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.753
Well...

43:56.920 --> 43:58.512
not so much lately.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.917
But I'm going to try harder.

44:06.480 --> 44:07.970
I love you guys so much.

44:08.120 --> 44:10.759
I love you too, Mom.

44:17.920 --> 44:20.036
- Bye, Cody.
- Bye, Cody. Bye.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.838
Have a great day.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.470
Can I have 10 more?

45:07.440 --> 45:09.874
Honey, I think you passed it.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.031
Did I?

45:12.200 --> 45:13.679
Back up.

45:24.960 --> 45:27.599
What is going on?

45:35.280 --> 45:37.953
It's more beautiful.

45:38.120 --> 45:39.553
Oh, I have a garden.

45:39.720 --> 45:42.109
Purple flowers.

45:42.280 --> 45:43.599
It's gorgeous.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.552
I know.

45:46.840 --> 45:50.674
Wow. The paint is so beautiful.

45:50.840 --> 45:52.671
My swing is fixed!

46:00.240 --> 46:01.593
Oh, my God.

46:04.480 --> 46:05.754
I have new shutters.

46:05.920 --> 46:07.592
Who did this?

46:07.760 --> 46:10.115
This is incredible.
It's incredible.

46:10.280 --> 46:11.320
Surprise.

46:11.440 --> 46:13.240
Welcome home, Keller family.

46:13.280 --> 46:14.599
Welcome home.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.512
Cody, did you do this?

46:16.680 --> 46:18.420
Yes, to make everyone happy.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.273
Cody, whose car is that?

46:21.440 --> 46:23.271
It's yours.

46:23.440 --> 46:24.998
# Mm, baby #

46:26.840 --> 46:30.276
# I want to know you,
sexy lady #

46:30.440 --> 46:35.116
# I want to put you
on the screen #

46:35.280 --> 46:36.599
# Looking fine,
my sexy lady #

46:36.600 --> 46:37.799
Just concentrate on the road, honey.

46:37.800 --> 46:38.994
Yay!

46:39.160 --> 46:42.118
# I want to see you working
on the dance floor #

46:42.320 --> 46:45.198
# Looking good, sexy lady #

46:45.400 --> 46:46.799
# Out there, the people... #

46:46.800 --> 46:48.677
Cody...

46:48.840 --> 46:52.116
where did you get
the parts for the car?

46:59.280 --> 47:00.998
Ah, look who it is.

47:01.160 --> 47:03.993
Looks like Keller showed up
for his beating.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.479
- Back off.
- Ooh.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.517
Is Henry playing tough?

47:07.720 --> 47:09.319
Henry and Cody can play tough.

47:09.320 --> 47:10.320
- Huh?
- Huh?

47:10.480 --> 47:11.839
Yo, stretch, we're playing

47:11.840 --> 47:13.440
you make it, you take it.

47:13.480 --> 47:15.072
If we beat you,

47:15.240 --> 47:16.759
you'll never bother Henry again.

47:16.760 --> 47:19.991
If you beat us,
Cody will personally

47:20.160 --> 47:22.590
assist you in giving
Henry a smackdown.

47:22.680 --> 47:23.680
Are you crazy?

47:23.840 --> 47:25.170
I suck at basketball.

47:25.240 --> 47:27.276
All right. First to seven wins.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.908
Trust me, Henry.

47:31.400 --> 47:32.840
Well, are you any good?

47:32.920 --> 47:34.069
Is Cody any good?

47:34.240 --> 47:35.759
Allow the master to demonstrate.

47:35.760 --> 47:38.752
Cody class is now in session.

47:38.960 --> 47:41.239
Keep your science project
out of my face, Keller.

47:41.240 --> 47:43.549
Your game got
no bandwidth, sucker.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.570
Where'd you learn trash talk?

47:45.680 --> 47:46.680
You too, homey.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.433
Cody!

47:53.640 --> 47:55.198
Hold on a minute, Henry.

47:55.360 --> 47:57.140
I'm just getting warmed up.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.958
# Hip, hop, I just can't stop... #

48:01.120 --> 48:02.790
Cody!
They're killing us!

48:02.880 --> 48:06.760
Don't worry, Henry. The bigger
they come, the harder they fall.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.559
Did that go in?
I didn't see it.

48:08.560 --> 48:10.039
I'm sorry. Did it? Yeah.

48:10.040 --> 48:11.719
I hope you're ready
to choke, Warren.

48:11.720 --> 48:14.188
# If only you can know #

48:14.360 --> 48:16.794
# I'll let you take a little look #

48:16.960 --> 48:19.793
# Before I start the show #

48:20.000 --> 48:21.069
# Go down #

48:21.240 --> 48:23.239
# Hit the ground,
you going to make me... #

48:23.240 --> 48:24.399
Hold 'em back, little buddy.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.152
I got the moves to cruise.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.320
Yee-hah!

48:27.480 --> 48:30.074
# You might miss something new #

48:31.320 --> 48:32.880
# Go look in your book... #

48:33.040 --> 48:34.234
6-nothing.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.079
You're getting slaughtered, Keller.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.638
What's wrong?

48:37.800 --> 48:40.159
- You keep missing.
- Hit me with the ball.

48:40.160 --> 48:41.593
- What?
- Hit me.

48:41.760 --> 48:43.080
Hit me with the ball.

48:43.160 --> 48:44.319
My targeting is off-line.

48:49.760 --> 48:51.113
Hit me again.

48:52.280 --> 48:53.508
Hit me harder.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.279
Targeting back online.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.439
Let's go teach these bums a lesson.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.639
Come on, you two stooges.

49:06.640 --> 49:10.394
Larry, Moe, and his country cousin,
way too slow.

49:12.040 --> 49:13.792
- Yeah!

49:13.960 --> 49:15.234
Yee-hah!

49:15.400 --> 49:17.199
I call this one the Cody rope-a-dope,

49:17.200 --> 49:18.679
and you the dope, fool.

49:19.720 --> 49:20.994
Whoa!

49:21.160 --> 49:23.116
Ah, yeah!

49:24.720 --> 49:26.380
To the left.
To the right.

49:26.520 --> 49:27.520
Up high.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.636
Down low.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.994
Go!

49:33.800 --> 49:35.039
Here I go. Here I go.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.792
Here I go!

49:36.960 --> 49:38.313
Boo-yah!

49:38.480 --> 49:39.959
Too slow, Warren.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.991
Back off, bugaboo.

49:43.160 --> 49:46.789
Kobe Cody is coming on through!

49:47.000 --> 49:49.434
6-5. One more, and we're tied.

50:00.320 --> 50:01.673
Slam a basket, Henry.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.399
I just can't do it, Cody.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.519
I put a tracking device
on the ball.

50:05.520 --> 50:07.078
Shoot. It'll go in.

50:07.240 --> 50:09.549
Shoot! It will go in.

50:09.720 --> 50:11.790
You can do it, Henry.

50:24.880 --> 50:26.836
Yeah!

50:28.120 --> 50:30.350
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

50:30.520 --> 50:32.988
We won.
Oh, yeah.

50:38.760 --> 50:40.512
What's wrong, Henry?

50:40.720 --> 50:42.759
Since you put
a tracking device in it,

50:42.760 --> 50:44.557
it wasn't really me.

50:44.720 --> 50:46.039
Cody was just messing with you.

50:46.040 --> 50:47.559
There's no tracking device.

50:47.560 --> 50:48.759
You did that yourself.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.796
Are you serious?

50:50.960 --> 50:52.188
Oh, yeah!

50:52.400 --> 50:54.630
High-five. Whoa.

50:54.800 --> 50:56.119
Good game, Dirk.

50:56.320 --> 50:59.110
- Good game, Henry.
- No hard feelings, Warren.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.559
I promise I'm going to find you.

51:04.560 --> 51:06.790
- No!
- Yeah...

51:07.000 --> 51:08.159
- Cody!
- ...no hard feelings.

51:08.160 --> 51:11.277
- Cody, are you okay?

51:14.080 --> 51:17.072
Aww, is little baby Henry
going to cry?

51:17.240 --> 51:19.679
Without your stupid toy,
you're nothing.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.520
You hear me?
You're nothing.

51:25.600 --> 51:28.239
- Cody?

51:28.400 --> 51:30.311
I activated your GPS...

51:30.520 --> 51:32.439
Have them change
your ball bearing...

51:32.440 --> 51:33.639
I want to stay with you.

51:33.640 --> 51:35.631
I will find you!

51:35.800 --> 51:37.756
- I'll know where you are.
- Go!

51:37.920 --> 51:39.273
Wake up.

51:39.440 --> 51:41.032
Come on, Cody, wake up.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.197
Kinetech. Kinetech.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.759
Oh, you had me worried there.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.671
Allan. We need to find Allan.

51:48.840 --> 51:50.114
He's in danger.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.280
Who's Allan?

51:51.440 --> 51:52.793
Allan is my dad.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.230
Don't worry.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.436
We'll find him.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.589
Does any of this seem familiar?

52:08.760 --> 52:11.638
Cody feels home...

52:11.800 --> 52:13.313
my home.

52:16.120 --> 52:18.634
Oh, my gosh.

52:21.120 --> 52:22.394
I remember this.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.870
This, this is where Henry
found Cody.

52:29.720 --> 52:31.073
Allan?

52:31.240 --> 52:33.515
- Robo.
- Allan.

52:33.680 --> 52:35.193
Robo!

52:37.480 --> 52:39.516
Allan, I found you!

52:39.680 --> 52:41.432
What happened?

52:41.600 --> 52:43.272
I was so worried about you.

52:43.440 --> 52:45.317
- Buddy!
- Are you okay?

52:45.480 --> 52:47.596
Ah, man.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.228
Okay, who's this?

52:53.440 --> 52:55.396
This is Henry, my new friend.

52:55.560 --> 52:56.660
Henry saved Cody.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.432
Who's Cody?

52:58.600 --> 53:00.875
Henry named me Cody.
It's my name.

53:01.040 --> 53:03.429
Cody. I like that.

53:03.600 --> 53:06.990
- Pleasure to meet you, Henry.
- Yeah.

53:07.200 --> 53:08.839
Thank you for saving
my little boy.

53:08.840 --> 53:11.195
Listen, Cody, we have to go,

53:11.360 --> 53:12.839
'cause it's not safe here anymore.

53:12.840 --> 53:15.035
Henry, stay with us.

53:15.200 --> 53:17.191
Allan can be your father, too.

53:17.360 --> 53:20.352
I think Henry has a family
to go back to.

53:20.520 --> 53:21.555
Henry?

53:21.760 --> 53:23.273
I love you, Cody.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.271
I don't understand.

53:25.440 --> 53:26.634
What's going on?

53:26.800 --> 53:28.836
You're my best friend.

53:30.560 --> 53:33.239
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

53:33.240 --> 53:34.719
Stay with us.

53:36.720 --> 53:37.820
- Allan...
- Okay.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.319
- Thanks again, Henry.
- ...why can't Henry

53:39.320 --> 53:40.719
- stay with Cody?
- Okay, come on.

53:40.720 --> 53:42.399
I'm sorry, buddy, but we got to go.

53:42.400 --> 53:44.709
- Come on.
- Henry, I need you!

53:44.880 --> 53:46.233
Allan, stop!

53:46.400 --> 53:48.914
Henry!

54:11.080 --> 54:13.196
Honey, what's wrong?

54:14.880 --> 54:17.075
I found Cody's father.

54:23.160 --> 54:25.151
I gave him back.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.920
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

54:29.040 --> 54:31.079
But you were the one
who found him.

54:31.080 --> 54:32.439
He's ours.
He belongs to us.

54:32.440 --> 54:34.908
He belongs to Mr. Topher.

54:36.040 --> 54:38.031
And besides,

54:38.200 --> 54:39.980
Cody was so happy to see him.

54:40.120 --> 54:42.793
He doesn't deserve him!

54:47.360 --> 54:49.351
Oh, hon, come here.

54:51.840 --> 54:53.876
Oh, sweetie.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.950
You did the right thing, honey.

54:57.880 --> 55:00.075
Cody wasn't ours to keep.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.170
I know how much you loved him.

55:05.840 --> 55:08.070
You were so brave.

55:16.640 --> 55:18.790
I love you, Mom.

55:32.320 --> 55:35.312
No one's going to take you away
ever again.

55:35.480 --> 55:37.152
I promise.

55:40.680 --> 55:43.638
Good night, Robosapien.

55:46.200 --> 55:48.156
My name is Cody.

55:49.760 --> 55:51.079
Okay...

55:51.280 --> 55:53.271
Cody.

55:53.440 --> 55:54.998
Good night.

55:57.680 --> 55:59.477
Good night, Henry,

55:59.640 --> 56:01.198
wherever you are.

56:22.480 --> 56:26.314
Oh, Cody.

56:26.480 --> 56:27.993
Cody.

56:30.600 --> 56:32.079
Cody.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.593
Hi. I'm Allan Topher.

57:13.760 --> 57:15.679
You're the guy who threw Cody
in the garbage.

57:15.680 --> 57:16.715
Actually...

57:19.280 --> 57:21.748
- Meagan!
- Cody!

57:21.920 --> 57:23.990
Cody's home!
Cody's home!

57:24.160 --> 57:25.479
Cody.

57:25.640 --> 57:27.278
Cody!

57:27.440 --> 57:28.759
- Cody!
- Oh, my.

57:28.960 --> 57:30.279
Cody, you're back.

57:30.440 --> 57:32.112
Hi, Mom.
Meet my dad.

57:32.280 --> 57:34.191
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

57:34.360 --> 57:36.715
Oh. Mom, this is...

57:36.880 --> 57:38.154
Allan Topher.

57:38.320 --> 57:40.436
Oh.
I'm Joanna.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.269
- Cody!
- Henry!

57:45.480 --> 57:47.152
Oh, group hug.

57:47.320 --> 57:48.992
Okay, okay. Too much love.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.639
Cannot breathe.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.310
Oh, thank you so much.

57:54.480 --> 57:56.799
I wasn't sure if I'd ever see you again.

57:56.800 --> 57:59.239
It was Allan's idea
to come see you guys.

57:59.240 --> 58:00.679
You're looking good, Mom.

58:00.680 --> 58:03.069
- Love the hair.
- Oh.

58:03.240 --> 58:07.074
Can you excuse me for a moment?

58:07.240 --> 58:09.834
See, Dad? I told you
Mom was pretty.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.470
So, does Cody have a mom?

58:13.640 --> 58:15.073
- Meagan!
- No.

58:15.240 --> 58:18.755
Actually, he doesn't.

58:18.920 --> 58:21.480
Mom, we were just
about to sit down

58:21.680 --> 58:23.070
to a family breakfast.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.839
Shouldn't you invite our guest?

58:24.840 --> 58:26.671
Of course we should.

58:26.840 --> 58:29.513
Would you like to join us?

58:29.680 --> 58:32.717
Bonjour.
Welcome to Cody's Café.

58:32.880 --> 58:36.714
# If you want to see what I can do,
you just got to ask #

58:36.880 --> 58:38.639
- # Burning up the floor #

58:38.640 --> 58:41.393
- # 'Bout to ignite #
- Breakfast is served.

58:41.560 --> 58:43.039
# I have everything you need #

58:43.040 --> 58:45.479
- # But we got to be fast #
- Crepes à la Cody.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.950
# My fears have gone away,
it's time to fly #

58:49.120 --> 58:50.559
- Wait. Kids.
- # Can you move it? #

58:50.560 --> 58:51.839
- # Groove it? #
- # Yes, I can #

58:51.840 --> 58:53.439
# Can you follow what I'm doing? #

58:53.440 --> 58:54.759
# Yes, I can #

58:54.920 --> 58:56.199
# Can you scream, can you shout? #

58:56.200 --> 58:58.270
- # Yes, I can #
- # 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 #

58:58.440 --> 59:00.317
# This is the countdown #

59:00.480 --> 59:02.480
# You know I won't let you down #

59:02.600 --> 59:04.719
# Let's keep going another round... #

59:04.720 --> 59:06.759
- Meagan and Henry.
- # 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 #

59:06.760 --> 59:08.796
# Yeah, this is the countdown #

59:08.960 --> 59:10.919
# You know I won't let you down #

59:10.920 --> 59:13.036
# Let's keep going another round #

59:13.200 --> 59:14.639
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

59:14.640 --> 59:17.552
# Going to hit you
with the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. #

59:17.720 --> 59:18.720
Cody, come on.

59:18.880 --> 59:21.039
- Must be nice living here.
- Come on.

59:21.040 --> 59:23.235
Let's leave 'em alone.

59:26.320 --> 59:27.992
Can I show you a little...

59:28.160 --> 59:29.229
- Sure.
- Yeah.

59:29.400 --> 59:30.840
This is just some stuff..

59:30.920 --> 59:32.399
that I have from...

59:32.560 --> 59:33.913
- Wow.
- Yeah.

59:34.080 --> 59:35.450
Wow, that's so cute.

59:36.920 --> 59:38.399
Well, you keep pictures of him

59:38.400 --> 59:39.830
like he's a real baby.

59:39.920 --> 59:42.753
Yeah, well, he is my baby.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.399
Hmm.

59:45.920 --> 59:48.199
Come on, Cody,
let's go to Mardi Gras.

59:48.200 --> 59:49.713
Stay close.

59:55.320 --> 59:57.599
The kids, they have the robot.
They just left the house.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.759
James, do not let him
out of your sight.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.239
If you lose him, you're dead.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.275
I'm on it, sir.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.370
What?
What happened?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.795
What happened?
Are you under attack?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.639
I.. I'm fine. Hot!

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.558
On the trail, sir.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.090
James just screamed like a girl.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.599
Mom is so into Allan.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.636
It's totally weird to watch her.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.189
I think he's nice and cool.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.080
Allan's lucky.
Mom's hot.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.790
Hey, that's my mom
you're talking about.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.679
Now, when you see this logo,

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:58.159
you're going to run like mad.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.230
Kinetech.
Run like mad.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.879
What? Why?

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.837
Kinetech! Kinetech!

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.753
Whoa!
Slow down, man.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.593
- Whoo!
- Move out of the way.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.318
You two kids, stay here.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.238
Get that bot.
Come on.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.829
We got to get Cody.
Come on.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.559
Get him! Come on!

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.394
- Cody!
- Cody, where are you?

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.232
Come on, get him!

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.718
Left, right,
left, and right.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.519
Left and right and
left and right and...

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.150
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.710
- Hey, stop.
- They're up front.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.199
Watch out.
Watch out. Come on!

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.460
Cody, are you okay?

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.879
Shh. I'm incognito.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.075
Stop!

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.912
Run!

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.593
Cody!

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.599
Cody, come on.
Where are you?

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.273
Where'd they go?

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.315
Kinetech.
Oh! Sorry.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:17.836
Would you please
get out of the way?

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.593
Meagan, over here!

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.592
Cody!

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.679
Out of the way.
Everybody out of the way.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.999
We have to split up.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.119
Meet me at Mom's office
in five minutes.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.439
We have to find him.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.640
Okay.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.080
Cody! Cody!

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240
Out of my way.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.839
Go, go, go! Move.
Move aside.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.839
Official business here.
Stop that robot!

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:44.114
Cody, wait!

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.679
- Stop that boy!
- Stop!

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.398
Come on.
There he is.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.593
Cody, stop.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.850
What's going on?

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.550
Kinetech.
Serious danger.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.479
Henry, come on.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.190
There they are.
Get 'em!

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.590
Come out the back.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.109
Here we go. Hah!
We got you now.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.279
We're coming up here.

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280
We got him.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.188
We're in trouble.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.472
Cody, just stay behind my back.

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.070
I'll take care of you.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.794
Step aside, kid,
and you won't get hurt.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.190
No, I'm not moving.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.033
But I don't want any trouble.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.156
I know origami, so you guys

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.709
should just turn around
and leave,

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.810
and none of you will get hurt.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.319
Right.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.238
Just hold on tight.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:49.992
Don't be afraid.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.958
Don't worry, Henry.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.359
Cody's got you.
Fasten your seat belt.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.078
This could get bumpy.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.710
Am I the only one that
didn't know that robot could fly?!

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.519
I didn't know either, sir.

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.272
Whoo-hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.519
Don't drop me.
Please don't drop me.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:26.193
That is the primordial
sound of human fear.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:27.959
You don't have a parachute?

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.598
Nope, no parachute.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.360
But we do offer free bungee jumping,

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.875
no strings attached.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.395
Gotcha. Yeah!

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.959
Not funny.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.510
Just messing with you.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.399
You're always safe with Cody.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.550
I didn't know you could fly.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.560
- I didn't know either.
- Wow.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.511
If you like that,

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.352
then you'll love this.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.078
Whoo-hoo!

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.118
I'm a superhero!

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.993
- Whoa! Whoa ho!
- Cool, huh?

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.958
Yeah! Whoo!

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.110
Oh, I hope Meagan's okay.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.540
We have to find her.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.516
Copy that.
Locating Meagan.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.239
Meagan located.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.940
Great.
Cody, take us down to that corner.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.956
Thanks for flying Air Cody.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.799
That's incredible!
You can fly?!

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.951
We need to call Mom.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.270
They're probably after Allan, too.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.920
Mom!

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.957
- Hel...
- Hello.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.913
This is Niles Porter.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.236
I've got your mother,

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:45.399
and if you ever want
to see her again,

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.679
you're going to bring
Robosapien to me

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.591
at Kinetech now.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.273
And come alone.

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.799
You understand what I'm saying?

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.119
Yes.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.793
Bye-bye.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.290
Well, that went well.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.271
They kidnapped Mom and Allan!

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.274
Why?
They said to bring Cody to Kinetech.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.430
What do you think we should do?

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.271
Jet-pack Cody has 197 ways

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.277
to sneak into Kinetech,

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.471
and we only need one.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.990
Mom and Allan will be free
in no time.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.515
Joanna, I'm sorry

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:23.513
to resort to such barbaric tactics,

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.679
but Allan really left us no choice.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.759
Let her go.
She's not involved in this.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.637
I'm afraid I can't do that.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.940
Stand right there.
Enjoy the show.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.991
Behold...

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.355
the future of Kinetech.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.959
What have you done?

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.710
Allan and Mom located.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:16.680
I'm really sorry for dragging
your family into this.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:23.150
Cody's the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.399
He's brought me and my kids

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.675
closer than we've ever been.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.192
I even got to meet you.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.439
Robosapien reporting for duty.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.759
- Cody!
- Cody!

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.239
- Always at your service.
- Oh, honey.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:47.399
- Hey, buddy.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.879
I can't believe you guys are here.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.314
Cody is designed
for search and rescue.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.919
- Guards approaching.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.239
It's a trap.
Come here.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.349
You understand?

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.795
- No problemo.
- Okay.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.552
Here they come.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.478
- Hey, hey! Easy!

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.238
Well done, kiddies.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.799
Right on time.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.279
And thank you for
bringing Robosapien.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.639
Release them, Porter.
You got what you wanted.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.239
Allan, I will once
the demonstration's over.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.198
The entire family will be released.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:18.634
All right, Robo, follow me.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.890
Don't hurt them!

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.518
Leave him alone!

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.550
I don't want to hurt anybody
unless I have to.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.319
Henry, we don't have any choice.

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.276
Cody, go.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.428
Henry!

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.839
I want to stay with you.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:38.840
No!

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.160
Cody!

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:13.118
We need to call Admiral Victor
from the U.S. Coast Guard,

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.837
put a stop to this.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:20.670
Porter,
is my delivery ready?

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.756
Yes, in a few moments,

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.038
your 100 little soldiers
will be online.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.359
Checklist.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.988
Voice recognition code...

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.832
90317 Porter, Niles.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.515
Activate primary command mode.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.790
Awaiting command.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:40.754
Plug in to the mainframe, Robo.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.229
Download operational system files

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:45.515
to all Robosapiens.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.714
Look at them.
Look at them.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.034
Good. Goody, goody.

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.476
Now I reprogram the search
and rescue protocol

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.074
to search and destroy.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.273
Oh, yeah.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:39.230
It's time to play Simon Says.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.436
Excuse me?

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:44.512
There's no excuse for you, Porter.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:47.114
Simon says disarm.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.229
What is it doing?

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.595
Voice recognition code...

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.069
90317 Porter, Niles.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.240
Override.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.954
Override this, sucker.

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.070
Simon says dance.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.940
Porter, bring in the scientist,
the one who built him.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.599
You think you're being smart, huh?

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.272
Well, I'm warning you,

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.793
warning you.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.110
Psych.

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.839
Go get Allan.
Go get Allan.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:39.274
And the boy.
Go get the boy too.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.510
You want search and destroy?

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.234
Simon says 
search and destroy...

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.072
each other.

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.512
Uncuff him.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:19.839
Are you letting us go?

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.717
No, Mr. Topher, not yet.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.678
You and the kid
are coming with me.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.319
Cody problems.

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.079
No, let him go!
He's just a kid.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.719
She's right.
What do you need with him?

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.920
Come on, let's go.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.194
Watch the door, James.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.188
Hi. Great uniform.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.490
Remember me?
We met at Mardi Gras.

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:50.799
Really?

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.951
Yeah.

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:55.953
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.554
Yeah, but I have to call
my boyfriend.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.230
He's really possessive.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.839
He doesn't know where I am,

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.559
and he's going 
to be worried about me.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.039
He'll come looking for her.
Stalker type.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.554
So do you have
a phone I could use?

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.199
It'll just be a minute.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.555
Oh, okay.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.836
I...
just one call.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.558
- Okay.
- Thanks.

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.190
A little privacy?

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.719
You know, he's really jealous.
If he hears anyone...

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.450
Oh. Yeah.
No problem. Sure.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:27.239
- Thanks. Restraining order.
- Sorry. Got you.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.580
Simon says find the files.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.080
- Get off there.
- No.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.399
- Somebody get him.
- Look out.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.833
Porter!

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.433
Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.020
Come and get me, boys.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.599
- Get off there!
- Whoops.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.716
Simon didn't say that.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.996
- Come on.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.359
- Oh, man.

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.430
- Henry.
- Here I come.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.079
- Coming through.
- Allan!

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.918
Make it stop.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.520
Oh, I'm sorry, Porter.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.159
I told you he's evolving.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.479
Then turn him off,
or someone will get hurt.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.948
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.759
He's learned to reprogram himself.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:06.959
Our commands won't work.

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.029
Hey, hey!

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.639
Come here, you little...
where I can...

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.799
- Come over here.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:13.999
Are you saying he
can never be a weapon?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.797
Not if he doesn't want to.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.428
Then that robot is wasting my time.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.631
- No!
- And so are you, kid.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.234
Henry!

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:39.473
No!

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.359
- Let's go.
- He's gone. Come on.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.153
Lay down your weapons.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.239
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it easy.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.399
- Hey!
- Don't move!

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.628
Is he all right?

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.930
Can you save him?

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.879
I don't know.
He's badly damaged.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.880
All right.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.679
Clear that table.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:07.911
Henry, grab some tools
off that table over there.

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.308
Move that over.

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:11.715
Come on. You can do it.

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:13.839
Break open his chest plate, quick.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.540
We need to patch him in
and get some levels.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.193
Okay.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:20.430
It doesn't look good.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.999
All right, you're going to scan
back and forth on it, okay?

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.831
I'm scanning.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.838
It's dropping.
It keeps dropping.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:30.359
Okay, power's dropping.
Backup is gone.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.599
But can't we just reboot?

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.279
Without backup,
everything will be erased.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.191
Cody will die.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.810
We got to keep him going.
Give me that.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.039
Give the status of that.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.239
It's damaged.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.079
It's not putting out
any infrared light at all.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.719
All right, the pulse
pierced his battery.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.358
This outlet is fried.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.719
Hang in there, Cody.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.959
You can do it.
Come on.

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.210
We got to get him electrical.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.119
Solar power!

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.799
He was never equipped for it!

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.119
I modified him.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.079
Here. Wire up these
backpack solar panels.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.389
Okay.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.437
Give me the soldering gun.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.559
30 seconds!

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.559
You got to harness it somehow.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.030
Hang in there, Cody.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.111
- 15 seconds!
- Hurry! Hurry!

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.919
More.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.040
It's registering.

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.594
We've got power coming in the panels!

01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:58.997
Hold your breath.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.479
Come back.

01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.868
- Okay.
- Cody.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.199
- It's coming in...
- Come back.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.719
...but it's not coming up.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.199
- Come back.
- Come on, Cody.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.589
Please, little buddy, don't go.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.598
He's gone.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:46.158
Take 'em.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.193
Why the long faces?

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.839
Aren't you glad to see me?

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.079
- Oh! Oh, yeah!
- Cody!

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.071
You're alive!

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.753
You're alive.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.349
- You're alive.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.670
- Oh, he's alive.
- We got power!

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:21.199
He's coming back.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.879
- Holy smokes.
- Put it back.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.080
Put it back.
Cody.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.519
Cody.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.439
Oh, Cody, you're back.

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:35.194
Henry, we did it.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.879
Oh. Oh.

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:45.032
Son, you want to explain
this mess to me?

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.240
Yes, sir, I do,

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.879
but first I want you to meet

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.439
the world's bravest family.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.080
Hey!

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:02.232
Happy...
hey!

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.952
Oh.
Cute picture, tough guy.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.959
I'm just glad to have
my day job back.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.075
I bet you are.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.599
Here you go, Mom.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.591
Thank you.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.228
Well, cheers. To you.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.992
To us.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.318
# Like an angel #

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.516
# Must be in heaven,
heaven #

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.353
# Surprising, surprising,
so enticing #

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:47.875
# Like an angel #

01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:50.710
# Must be in heaven,
heaven, heaven, heaven #

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.959
# Stunning,
so completely stunning... #

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.279
Hi, Jenna.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:55.793
Hey, Henry.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.170
Where's your date?

01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.315
# Next to me... #

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.950
A little birdie suggested
I come alone.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.480
Are you sure it was
a little birdie?

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.790
So do you want to dance?

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:10.714
Actually, not that big of a dancer.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.313
You're Henry Keller.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.839
You could do anything.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:16.274
Come on, let's dance.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.995
Sweet.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.958
Kids look really happy.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.758
Hmm. They do.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.671
Yo, everybody.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.273
It's Robo time.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.678
# Find your place #

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.353
# Bring it on #

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.873
# Y'all do that #

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.229
# Bring it on #

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:00.036
# I'm ready for something,
something new #

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:03.829
# I'm ready to show
the world what I can do #

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.476
# It's going to be rocking,
that's all I can say #

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.198
# No reason to stop #

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.555
# 'Cause I'm going
all the way #

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.072
# I'm sick of playing games #

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.279
# It's time to get down
to what's real #

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:23.034
# Nothing's going
to change the way #

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:25.794
# That I feel #

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:28.679
# Come on, bring it on #

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:30.478
# Got the wind on my back #

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.312
# I'm feeling strong #

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:34.550
# Got my flag unfurled #

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:36.160
# I'm singing the song #

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.990
- # So bring it #
- # Bring it #

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.559
# Bring it on #

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.399
# Bring it on #

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.232
# Find your place #

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.152
# Bring it on #

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.435
# Y'all do that. #

01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:58.353
# 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 #

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.630
# If you want
to see what I can do #

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.069
- # You just got to ask #
- # Yeah #

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.074
# Burning up the floor,
'bout to ignite #

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.030
# I have everything
you need #

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.355
# But we got to be fast #

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:15.593
# My fears have gone away,
it's time to fly #

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.239
# Can you move it,
can you groove it? #

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.593
# Yes, I can #

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.799
- # Can you follow what I'm doing? #
- # Yes, I can #

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:23.479
- # Can you scream, can you shout? #
- # Yes, I can #

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.879
# 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 #

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.530
# This is the countdown #

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.599
# You know I won't let you down #

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.439
# Let's keep going another round #

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:33.230
# I'm going to hit you
with the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 #

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.039
# Yeah, this is the countdown #

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.040
# You know I won't let you down #

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.039
# Let's keep going another round #

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.830
# I'm going to hit you
with the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 #

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.330
# This is the countdown #

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.476
# You know I won't let you down #

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.679
# Let's keep going another round #

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:50.530
# I'm going to hit you
with the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. #
