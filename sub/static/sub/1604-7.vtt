as an immunosuppressant.

Strontium-90 isn't something you can
pick up at your local Piggly Wiggly.

living in that lab.

a teaching job at Purdue.

aboutyourson.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.725
Does he have Kurz disease?
Yeah.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.651
How did you know that?
Because I saw dozens of corpses

14:24.864 --> 14:27.401

of the disease.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.528

14:29.744 --> 14:32.611

know he's Ethan's real father?

15:02.819 --> 15:04.730
Yeah.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.902
When Ethan was 5,
he developed Kurz

15:07.115 --> 15:11.324
and they told us it was untreatable.
Frederick wouldn't accept that.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.821
He had contacts in
the pharmaceutical industry.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.407
He reached out to them to secure
research funding into the disease

15:19.627 --> 15:22.209
but everyone turned him down.
Why?

15:23.798 --> 15:27.711
Kurz is too rare.
Small disease means small profits.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.215
That's why Barnes is killing. He wants to
infect enough people with Kurz

15:31.431 --> 15:33.092
that it gets on the public's radar.
Why?

15:33.307 --> 15:35.218
Because then it can't be ignored
anymore.

The more people that die,
the more attention the disease gets.
