<i>You ever wake up one day
and realize nothing in your life</i>

02:26.065 --> 02:28.032
<i>was the way you thought it would be?</i>

02:31.635 --> 02:32.897
<i>No.</i>

02:37.307 --> 02:38.742
<i>Not even once?</i>

02:39.115 --> 02:41.966
<i>No. Not even once.</i>

02:44.514 --> 02:49.052
<i>I knew from the start
that life was pretty much all shit.</i>

02:49.152 --> 02:50.541
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

02:51.720 --> 02:53.174
<i>God?</i>

02:54.857 --> 02:56.691
<i>God has nothing to do with it.</i>

02:58.996 --> 03:01.830
Welcome to Manila! Enjoy your stay!

03:04.534 --> 03:05.941
Want to dance?

03:13.476 --> 03:15.570
<i>I woke up that way this morning.</i>

03:16.279 --> 03:19.663
<i>Woke up and realized
I wasn't who I thought I was</i>

03:19.763 --> 03:22.798
<i>or who I thought I would be.
Not even close.</i>

03:23.186 --> 03:26.069
<i>And I didn't even realize until today.</i>

03:26.656 --> 03:28.925
<i>At least now you know.</i>

03:47.044 --> 03:48.112
I am done with you, got it?

03:48.212 --> 03:50.711
- Yeah, lower your voice.
- Don't you shut me up!

04:12.736 --> 04:16.036
Is it okay if we never see
each other again after tonight?

04:49.510 --> 04:50.705
Let me go!

04:52.442 --> 04:53.680
No!

06:08.151 --> 06:09.186
Are you okay?

06:09.586 --> 06:12.805
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I guess.

06:14.157 --> 06:15.461
Good.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.030
Buy you a drink?

06:28.271 --> 06:31.806
There you go folks. My name is Bette
if you need anything else.

06:36.579 --> 06:39.115
- So who was the...?
- Nobody important.

06:39.215 --> 06:43.952
At least nobody who's important
any longer, yes?

06:53.430 --> 06:54.998
Want to dance?

06:55.598 --> 06:58.101
I... don't move so well.

06:58.201 --> 07:02.070
- You moved pretty well out there.
- Because it mattered.

08:09.773 --> 08:11.323
Here.

09:32.655 --> 09:37.161
I've asked Alma to come in every day
from now on to open the side chapel.

09:37.561 --> 09:41.370
- Did you have any problems getting in?
- No. No, I didn't Father. Thank you.

09:44.867 --> 09:48.137
I've kept your situation between us
as you've requested.

09:48.237 --> 09:50.474
She was surprised to hear
you're coming in every day.

09:51.074 --> 09:53.977
God is our refuge and strength.

09:54.077 --> 09:57.581
A very present hope in times of trouble.

09:58.281 --> 10:01.734
Psalm 46. One of my favorites.

10:03.154 --> 10:04.969
But how are you doing?

10:07.824 --> 10:10.358
I'm... I'm scared, Father.

10:13.663 --> 10:17.333
Cast thy burden unto the Lord
and he shall sustain thee.

10:17.433 --> 10:20.570
I have faith in God's strength,
believe me.

10:20.670 --> 10:24.437
I do. But I just don't know
about my own anymore.

11:08.284 --> 11:11.044
- <i>Yes?</i>
- It's Deacon.

11:11.744 --> 11:15.259
- <i>It's been a long time, my friend.</i>
- I'm in town and I need help.

11:16.259 --> 11:19.696
<i>I am at your service without question.
You know that.</i>

11:19.796 --> 11:22.193
- <i>But...</i>
- But what?

11:22.766 --> 11:27.070
- <i>But nothing. Where are you?</i>
- The Golden Tree, room 803.

11:27.170 --> 11:30.379
<i>Can you speak over the open line?</i>

11:32.308 --> 11:33.662
I don't know.

11:34.651 --> 11:37.980
- <i>Then wait until I get there.</i>
- Hold on.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.193
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Can you get some morphine?

11:43.151 --> 11:45.653
- <i>Yes, yes.</i>
- Thanks.

13:41.938 --> 13:44.522
Deacon? It's me.

13:53.449 --> 13:57.274
- How are you, man.
- It's been a long time.

13:58.521 --> 13:59.914
Good to see you, my friend.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.560
- Who is he?
- That's Nardo, my right hand man.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.632
What happened?

14:19.575 --> 14:22.823
Oh, my God. Your kidney?

14:23.879 --> 14:25.015
Probably, yeah.

14:26.415 --> 14:29.359
They left money, medication. Smart.

14:29.459 --> 14:32.477
This way they can claim
that you sold it to them.

14:32.977 --> 14:34.380
Yeah.

14:34.757 --> 14:36.225
Where's Frankie and Julius?

14:36.325 --> 14:39.355
They're gone.
It's been many years, Deacon.

14:40.730 --> 14:43.399
- It's only the two of you?
- Yep.

14:43.499 --> 14:45.371
That's just great.

14:45.868 --> 14:48.307
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.819
Let me go!

15:02.385 --> 15:05.271
Let him go. He's my brother.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.789
Deacon?

15:06.889 --> 15:09.992
- Go home, I'll call you.
- What? Are you crazy?

15:10.092 --> 15:13.462
George, you're not listening.
We have a delay. Just go.

15:13.562 --> 15:16.355
A delay? It's scheduled
the day after tomorrow.

15:16.455 --> 15:18.782
You just can't postpone
this thing on a whim.

15:24.373 --> 15:26.543
Okay, what's going on here,
please, tell me.

15:26.943 --> 15:29.946
- George, go home, I'll call you.
- What's going on?

15:30.746 --> 15:33.183
Okay. Here.

15:33.283 --> 15:35.396
Oh, God. No. No.

15:35.496 --> 15:38.075
I should have known something
like this was gonna happen.

15:38.175 --> 15:39.981
Whenever you're involved
something goes wrong.

15:40.081 --> 15:42.173
- It always does, it always does.
- Just...

15:43.893 --> 15:45.795
- What are you doing?
- Go home.

15:45.895 --> 15:48.748
- I'm not going anywhere!
- Go home! Go!

15:48.848 --> 15:50.297
Deacon!

15:53.769 --> 15:55.037
Let me get you a doctor now.

15:55.137 --> 15:58.140
No time for this. Just... we have to go.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.744
- Did you get my morphine?
- Yes, yes, yes, sure. Here.

16:02.144 --> 16:04.911
Great, thanks.

16:07.083 --> 16:10.587
- I suppose there was a woman, right?
- There was a woman, yeah.

16:11.687 --> 16:16.298
British. Maybe Irish.
An accent, dark hair.

16:17.660 --> 16:22.098
I will check the security tapes
from the hotel. How did you meet?

16:22.598 --> 16:25.468
On the street.
Then she took me to a club.

16:25.868 --> 16:30.006
Which club? Darlings?
Cabaret? The Vortex?

16:30.506 --> 16:32.031
Vortex.

16:34.377 --> 16:35.912
Are you carrying?

16:36.812 --> 16:38.728
Not anymore, Deacon. I...

16:38.828 --> 16:43.653
I have to be very careful these days.
The local police are no longer my friends.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.521
These things happen
in this part of the world.

16:45.921 --> 16:49.127
Perhaps it is best
if you just let it go.

16:49.992 --> 16:52.334
Please, let it go.

16:52.862 --> 16:55.853
It's mine. I want it back.

16:58.901 --> 17:02.180
Alright. I'll do some digging.

17:02.280 --> 17:06.428
I'll call you.
Nardo will be waiting downstairs.

17:06.528 --> 17:08.118
Okay.

17:10.813 --> 17:15.540
Hey, man, be careful
and keep a low profile.

17:22.491 --> 17:24.057
Here.

17:35.939 --> 17:39.308
Here you go folks. My name is Bette
if you need anything else.

18:14.477 --> 18:18.015
- It's my problem. Stay out of this.
- It is not just yours.

18:19.415 --> 18:22.685
- George, you're a teacher.
- I'm a professor.

18:22.785 --> 18:25.621
- What do you think you can do?
- Whatever I have to.

18:25.721 --> 18:28.474
- How much time do we have?
- Maybe 10 hours.

18:28.574 --> 18:31.592
- Until it goes to somebody else.
- Then we should hurry.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.535
How's your Filipino?

18:39.635 --> 18:43.033
It's called Tagalog, and it's better
than yours. I live here.

18:45.007 --> 18:48.824
- Whatever you do, stay out of my way.
- Okay.

18:49.472 --> 18:52.649
Deacon, what's the bible for?

18:52.749 --> 18:54.348
Inspiration.

19:18.641 --> 19:21.077
It's the middle of the day.
How can it be full like this?

19:21.777 --> 19:26.714
Places like this, it's always midnight.
The party never stops. Here.

19:28.217 --> 19:32.708
Hi, there. Your name is Bette, right?
Remember me?

19:34.757 --> 19:36.793
Okay, she just says,
"What do you want to drink?"

19:36.893 --> 19:38.694
Oh, come on. She speaks English.

19:38.794 --> 19:40.561
- You know me, Bette.
- Just hang on.

19:43.966 --> 19:48.602
I was here with a girl named Anna
in this spot. Remember?

19:49.105 --> 19:53.409
She just says she doesn't speak English,
alright. She doesn't speak English.

19:53.509 --> 19:57.429
You see this Bible? It will leave
big bruises and I will beat you with it

19:57.529 --> 20:00.550
if you don't tell me what's going on
and who set me up.

20:01.350 --> 20:02.354
Arnel!

20:08.658 --> 20:11.027
It's time for you to go.

20:11.127 --> 20:15.231
You can walk out or be carried out.
Your choice.

20:15.331 --> 20:18.000
See, she speaks English.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.271
I told you, didn't I?

24:28.517 --> 24:30.719
- Book.
- Come on, Deacon.

24:30.819 --> 24:32.655
- Now.
- Deacon!

24:32.855 --> 24:34.386
Now!

24:38.794 --> 24:40.355
I warned you before.

24:42.932 --> 24:45.868
Book will leave deep bruises.

24:45.968 --> 24:48.154
Take a long time to heal.

24:48.270 --> 24:51.053
Last chance. Where's my kidney?

24:51.153 --> 24:53.940
I don't know anything, I swear.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.905
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.073
No!

25:07.173 --> 25:11.421
No, no! Okay! Okay. Her name is Anna.

25:13.579 --> 25:16.415
- Last name?
- Riley. Anna Riley.

25:16.615 --> 25:20.586
- Do you know where she is?
- Gratis. It's a fight club.

25:20.886 --> 25:22.900
She said she was going
with Zoltan tonight.

25:24.823 --> 25:28.693
- Who's Zoltan? Her pimp?
- Sort of. Yes.

25:32.715 --> 25:34.728
Muscle guy. Blonde highlights?

25:36.035 --> 25:38.170
- Answer me!
- No.

25:38.370 --> 25:42.108
That was the other guy.
The one who came in to pay me.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.303
Drake.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.347
I heard her call him Drake.
Can I go now?

25:48.747 --> 25:50.550
Where's that fight club, Gratis?

25:51.150 --> 25:52.952
- I don't know.
- Where?!

25:53.052 --> 25:56.388
It's an underground club.
They change the location every week.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.791
Just ask around. It's the truth.

25:58.891 --> 26:02.793
If you lied to me,
I swear I'll come back.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.956
And I'll be in a bad mood.

26:32.925 --> 26:36.162
So tell me. Was this really necessary?

26:36.262 --> 26:38.931
Plenty of blood spilled
in the bible, George.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.935
Nothing wrong with some blood
spilled on it.

26:42.562 --> 26:44.036
Deacon.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.770
Deacon! Deacon.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.072
Deacon.

27:04.556 --> 27:08.757
Wait, Deacon. Wait. It's alright.
It's alright. He's a friend. You're safe.

27:08.857 --> 27:12.598
- How did I get here?
- Your brother brought you here.

27:12.698 --> 27:15.000
How long was I out?

27:15.100 --> 27:16.956
Not very long.

27:22.941 --> 27:24.927
- This hospital, George?
- Yeah, I know, I know.

27:25.027 --> 27:26.779
I didn't know where else to go, okay?

27:26.979 --> 27:29.048
The head doctor here,
he's the kidney specialist.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.650
Nobody knows you're here.
You're not even checked in.

27:31.750 --> 27:34.260
Kung took care of that, okay?

27:40.659 --> 27:44.196
Your brother is a damned stubborn man.

27:44.296 --> 27:47.792
Listen, stubborn doesn't
even begin to cover it.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.675
- How do you know Deacon?
- Professionally.

27:52.775 --> 27:56.775
First we were on opposing sides
and then on the same side.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.758
You mean for the military or what?

28:00.813 --> 28:04.250
You do not know what your brother
does for a living.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.152
We're not close.

28:06.252 --> 28:09.455
I knew he had served
with the French special forces

28:09.555 --> 28:13.335
but I don't know
what he's done since then now.

28:15.327 --> 28:19.398
Your brother is a K and R expert.

28:19.598 --> 28:21.901
- K and R?
- Yes. Kidnap and rescue.

28:22.201 --> 28:26.915
He is someone that is hired to bring back
a kidnapped loved one home

28:27.015 --> 28:29.208
safe and sound.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.679
You said you were
on opposing sides though?

28:33.879 --> 28:35.212
Yes...

28:38.751 --> 28:40.119
What did the doctor say?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.584
That I have a missing kidney.
Come on, let's go.

28:42.684 --> 28:44.773
You shouldn't even be on your feet.

28:44.873 --> 28:47.501
- He gave me some morphine.
- Come on.

28:47.601 --> 28:51.330
Listen, George, when I was 22
with two broken legs,

28:51.430 --> 28:53.265
I crossed the Afghan desert.

28:53.365 --> 28:57.803
So compared to that,
a kidney missing, it's nothing.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.730
Come on.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.074
I never knew that.

29:02.174 --> 29:06.579
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You have some info?

29:06.679 --> 29:09.582
Yes, I do.
On the hotel cameras, nothing.

29:09.882 --> 29:15.521
Everything from that night was erased.
Somebody got paid off.

29:16.221 --> 29:20.477
But from the traffic cameras
I tracked you and the girl

29:20.577 --> 29:22.728
from the club to the hotel.

29:22.928 --> 29:25.199
Now here's a tighter angle.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.402
Her full name is Anna Riley.
Can you track down her cell?

29:30.102 --> 29:32.905
Sure. With a little extra money.

29:33.005 --> 29:34.640
Okay. Good.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.178
Recognize him?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.078
Yes.

29:39.178 --> 29:42.281
Nearby camera. He was watching you
get into the cab.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.484
I have his name. It's Drake.

29:44.684 --> 29:48.487
And the private club
where she works, it's Gratis.

29:48.637 --> 29:51.023
They change the location every week.
Can you find them?

29:51.323 --> 29:54.761
- Sure.
- Okay. What about weapons?

29:55.761 --> 29:57.424
What?

29:58.430 --> 30:02.901
Clubs such as Gratis
will have police protection.

30:03.001 --> 30:06.380
Deacon, you just can't run in there
like a bull in a China shop,

30:06.480 --> 30:10.839
kicking ass, and shooting off guns.
You have one kidney.

30:10.939 --> 30:13.806
The trail is getting cold.
We're going to lose them.

30:13.906 --> 30:17.848
But you could still live with just
one kidney. It is not worth the risk.

30:17.948 --> 30:19.849
You didn't tell him.

30:21.853 --> 30:24.421
Tell me? Tell me what?

30:27.860 --> 30:31.106
Here. Come with me.

30:49.248 --> 30:53.119
That's my daughter, Isabella.
She's nine.

30:53.819 --> 30:56.956
She has focal segmental
Glomerulosclerosis.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.425
It's... well, it's a kidney disease.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.928
And it's progressed
to chronic renal failure.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.964
Deacon's kidney was supposed to go
to Isabella two days from now

31:06.064 --> 31:10.790
and without a transplant
she has less than three months.

31:13.705 --> 31:17.841
I mean, if we don't get his kidney back
before they put it in somebody else,

31:19.177 --> 31:21.373
my daughter's going to die.

31:24.883 --> 31:28.853
That certainly puts things
in a new perspective.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.424
I will make my calls.

31:50.843 --> 31:54.380
First we'll see my guy
about tracking down her number,

31:54.480 --> 31:56.960
and then the guns, the hardware, okay?

31:57.060 --> 31:59.618
Okay. What about more men?

31:59.718 --> 32:04.523
I've made several calls, but I do not get
immediate responses like I used to.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.709
How about the company you work for?

32:08.127 --> 32:11.663
I was supposed to be in Europe,
but I walked away from a job,

32:11.763 --> 32:16.157
so I'm sure they're pissed,
so I'm alone.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.776
Okay, pull over. There.

32:23.876 --> 32:24.817
Okay.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.804
Right there. Right there. Right there.

32:40.299 --> 32:42.394
- He just jumped out.
- Yeah.

32:42.994 --> 32:47.862
Counter surveillance.
He'll be alright. He's a pro.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.726
How did you end up in this part
of the world?

32:57.826 --> 33:00.980
- Is your wife from here?
- No, no. Dutch.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.615
She studied here as an exchange student

33:03.715 --> 33:06.952
and fell in love with the city
and just didn't want to leave.

33:07.252 --> 33:10.790
How is she dealing
with this predicament?

33:11.423 --> 33:14.961
My wife, Mary, she died four years ago.

33:15.861 --> 33:18.324
She was only 37 years old.

33:18.424 --> 33:20.374
Breast cancer.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.991
Here we are.
I'll go see my guy about her number.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.226
Stay here.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.372
I'll be right back.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.736
Hello?

33:57.836 --> 33:59.404
<i>Kung's not answering his phone.</i>

33:59.504 --> 34:02.340
No. He's going inside to get
the girl's number.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.078
<i>Damn it. Okay.
Take the wheel and start the engine.</i>

34:06.178 --> 34:09.481
- Just... wait, wait, wait, where are you?
- <i>Just do what I say.</i>

34:09.581 --> 34:11.596
Okay, just hang on.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.563
- Okay.
- <i>Look diagonally, across the square</i>

34:22.663 --> 34:26.231
<i>there's a dark blue sedan between
a truck and a small car. You see it?</i>

34:26.331 --> 34:28.346
Okay, just... I...

34:29.900 --> 34:33.821
- Okay, yeah, yeah. I do.
- <i>Drive over there, not too fast.</i>

34:33.920 --> 34:35.887
<i>Pretend you're looking
for a parking spot.</i>

34:35.987 --> 34:38.810
<i>Then stop exactly parallel
to him, understand?</i>

34:38.909 --> 34:41.378
Okay, okay. Just hang on.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.009
Hey, guys. You don't look like tourists.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.613
Don't lose them! Go!

36:35.927 --> 36:37.961
- Faster!
- Okay, okay!

36:47.773 --> 36:49.574
- You're losing him!
- Just let me do this!

36:49.674 --> 36:52.344
Come on! What are you waiting for?

36:52.444 --> 36:54.782
Okay, jeez.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.260
- Pull up beside him.
- But they're working on the road.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.817
They'll move. Come on.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.434
Don't slow down!

37:16.534 --> 37:18.601
Don't fucking slow down!

37:41.393 --> 37:44.226
Hard left! Turn, turn, turn!

38:02.547 --> 38:04.104
- We're not going to fit through there.
- There's enough room.

38:04.204 --> 38:05.981
There's not enough room.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.754
- There's enough room!
- There's not enough room.

38:12.130 --> 38:14.339
- There's not enough room!
- There's enough fucking room!

38:17.012 --> 38:18.678
Come on, George!

38:32.777 --> 38:35.923
Okay. Let's go.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.364
Found the fights. It's in a slum
on the other side of the city.

39:06.544 --> 39:08.537
Is he asleep?

39:10.744 --> 39:12.292
Yeah.

39:13.418 --> 39:16.286
I don't know how he's stayed
on his feet this long.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.393
So your poor daughter.

39:21.643 --> 39:24.062
Will the transplant cure her?

39:25.597 --> 39:28.208
The prognosis is good.

39:28.633 --> 39:31.369
I know she'll have to be on medication
for the rest of her life

39:31.469 --> 39:33.589
but she'll recover.

39:34.089 --> 39:37.739
How and such a terrible thing
happen to an innocent little girl?

39:37.839 --> 39:40.528
With all the suffering
and injustice in the world

39:40.778 --> 39:44.208
I sometimes think that God must hate us.

39:44.682 --> 39:48.637
You know what? You're a kidnapper
and you're a criminal.

39:49.287 --> 39:51.763
So tell me, what do you know about God?

39:55.426 --> 39:57.443
Perhaps nothing.

39:59.430 --> 40:03.289
We are taught to thank God
for the good things that happen to us.

40:03.389 --> 40:06.605
Why then can we not blame him
for the bad things?

40:06.705 --> 40:08.879
That's not how it works. I mean,

40:08.979 --> 40:12.994
I don't hold God responsible.
If anything, I blame myself.

40:13.094 --> 40:17.833
Or if you're like me, you blame God
and you for Isabella's condition.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.267
You do what you want. But then again

40:20.367 --> 40:22.502
- you've always done that, right?
- Enough!

40:22.602 --> 40:27.493
Just remember if you had been able to keep
your pants on, we wouldn't be in this mess.

40:28.393 --> 40:32.430
We all have our sins
that we have to live with, alright?

40:32.530 --> 40:34.905
You certainly have yours.

40:36.117 --> 40:37.961
I have mine.

40:57.055 --> 41:00.191
It's thrilling for the wealthy
to come down to the slums

41:00.291 --> 41:04.396
and bet on the poor boys
killing each other. It's disgusting.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.197
Getting in?

41:06.297 --> 41:09.367
No problem.
The fights are an open secret.

41:09.767 --> 41:12.604
They collect a fee
from anyone with money.

41:12.704 --> 41:16.524
See those guys over there?
They are triad security.

41:16.624 --> 41:19.683
Some are local police on the take.

41:20.511 --> 41:23.481
- Be careful.
- Yeah. Keep the engine running.

41:23.581 --> 41:24.587
I'm coming.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.491
No. Not here.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.569
Listen...

42:17.869 --> 42:24.576
I'm sorry what I said before about you
being a kidnapper and a criminal.

42:24.776 --> 42:26.678
It's true I was.

42:26.778 --> 42:30.014
At a very early age
you were taught about God

42:30.114 --> 42:32.957
- and I was taught darker things.
- Wait!

42:35.053 --> 42:38.457
That's him. Drake.

43:05.283 --> 43:09.339
He's not picking up!
It's probably too noisy in there.

43:10.588 --> 43:13.973
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to warn him.

43:19.364 --> 43:22.072
Here. Take it.

43:24.469 --> 43:27.702
Be careful with that.
I'll keep trying him.

45:03.601 --> 45:05.106
Hello?

45:51.015 --> 45:53.091
I'm so sorry.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.007
- Who hired you?
- His name Drake. That's all I know.

45:56.107 --> 46:00.892
He's English. Ex-SAS.
I know him from the club.

46:00.992 --> 46:04.462
He was a customer.
He asked me to do it for a price.

46:04.562 --> 46:08.125
A big price. $30,000 American.

46:10.468 --> 46:12.822
- How did you get in touch with him?
- I didn't.

46:13.322 --> 46:17.422
He called me and his caller ID
was always blocked so...

46:17.522 --> 46:21.046
Look... it was only for the money.

46:21.446 --> 46:25.869
I wanted the money so that I could buy out
my contract with Zoltan and get out.

46:26.083 --> 46:30.360
Out of the club.
Out of... out of this life.

46:31.055 --> 46:35.186
I didn't realize what I was getting into.
I didn't think that...

46:38.229 --> 46:40.198
I've done things for money.

46:40.598 --> 46:46.036
Things I am not proud of.
But something like this? It sickened me.

46:52.210 --> 46:55.477
- Anna?
- Zoltan doesn't know, please.

46:59.016 --> 47:00.785
And who the fuck are you?

47:01.519 --> 47:05.456
- I'm just a friend.
- Friend? I know all her friends.

47:05.756 --> 47:09.264
But I don't know you.
So you're no friend.

47:10.094 --> 47:11.896
I'm not a pimp either.

47:13.397 --> 47:14.936
Anna!

47:15.600 --> 47:18.804
Stood me up baby.
I had to GPS your cell to find you.

47:19.604 --> 47:22.616
Don't. Same for you Zoltan, stand down.

47:26.477 --> 47:27.979
Anna?

47:28.079 --> 47:30.969
What the fuck is going on here?
Who are you?

47:31.449 --> 47:33.718
Definitely not a friend.

47:33.818 --> 47:36.484
You screwed up Anna. We were supposed to
meet me and then disappear for a few weeks.

47:36.584 --> 47:39.085
Now Deacon here has found you,
that's a problem.

47:40.525 --> 47:42.505
Mr. Deacon Lyle,

47:42.605 --> 47:45.747
my client wishes to make you an offer.
How much for you to walk away?

47:46.230 --> 47:48.735
When what's mine is returned to me.

47:51.068 --> 47:56.040
You amuse me. Now let me
paint this picture for you.

47:56.507 --> 47:57.775
This...

47:57.975 --> 48:01.197
lady is a professional escort.

48:01.312 --> 48:04.215
One who you were seen with last night
at a less-than-reputable club.

48:04.465 --> 48:05.972
Anna? Behind my back?

48:08.986 --> 48:10.788
This gentleman is her pimp.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.690
Also an officer of the peace.
Obviously unhappy.

48:16.494 --> 48:19.145
Recognize this pistol?
Your weapon, Deacon.

48:19.245 --> 48:21.599
I got it from your suitcase,
it has your fingerprints on it.

48:21.799 --> 48:23.868
This is what happened
when you turned up here tonight

48:23.968 --> 48:26.351
and found them both here together.

48:30.508 --> 48:34.879
Her pimp, an undercover police officer
shot dead with your gun.

48:35.179 --> 48:38.120
Now walk away and I'll give you 24 hours
before I turn over all this evidence

48:38.220 --> 48:41.550
- to the local precinct.
- I don't think so.

48:43.254 --> 48:48.125
Your choice. Walk away and live, stay
and you die, she dies, everybody dies.

48:48.225 --> 48:50.528
Listen my client wishes
for less mess and bloodshed

48:50.628 --> 48:55.195
but it really makes no difference to me,
so what's it going to be?

48:57.635 --> 49:01.773
Here's your choice... You're going
to tell me where my kidney is.

49:01.973 --> 49:04.479
I'll make it quick for you.
If you don't,

49:04.679 --> 49:07.656
I will cut you in small pieces
until you talk.

49:08.846 --> 49:10.715
Deacon, I have no orders
to eliminate you, man,

49:10.815 --> 49:12.782
- but if you keep pushing...
- Stop.

49:15.686 --> 49:17.188
Done my homework, George.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.224
You're a devout Catholic.
You're not going to kill anyone.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.693
Where is the kidney? Tell me.

49:24.061 --> 49:26.532
Put the gun down, George and walk away.

49:27.632 --> 49:31.869
Now. Or I'll make your little girl
an orphan without thinking twice.

49:31.969 --> 49:35.423
- Tell me where it is.
- It's too late, George.

49:35.523 --> 49:39.182
The kidney already has a new home.
It's in, it's over, walk away.

49:39.777 --> 49:44.118
He's lying, George.
They need me in case of a fuck up.

49:44.849 --> 49:48.156
They'll take the other one.
My other kidney.

49:48.786 --> 49:51.653
Look, in less than an hour,
I won't have any...

53:10.655 --> 53:13.088
Flash bomb! Get down!

54:04.175 --> 54:08.312
In my professional opinion,
we are screwed here.

54:08.812 --> 54:11.282
Dead gangsters. Dead police.

54:11.382 --> 54:14.885
You have no damn idea
of the nightmare we're headed for.

54:14.985 --> 54:19.437
We are marked men, Deacon.
We have to leave the city now.

54:21.525 --> 54:26.766
We let it go now, Isabella dies.
I'm not going to let her die.

54:29.066 --> 54:32.770
- Who's Isabella?
- She is my daughter.

54:33.170 --> 54:35.907
Deacon's kidney was supposed
to go to her.

54:36.407 --> 54:40.277
Kung, did you hear something
from your guy?

54:40.377 --> 54:42.146
Yes, he finally agreed.

54:42.446 --> 54:45.944
We bring the body to him,
he removes the kidney, packs it in ice,

54:46.044 --> 54:49.286
- and we're good to go.
- Wait, body?

54:49.386 --> 54:53.269
You're going to kill whoever got
the kidney? You can't do that.

54:53.369 --> 54:55.559
Yes, we can.

54:55.659 --> 54:57.328
Of course we can.

54:57.428 --> 55:00.698
What are Isabella's chances
if she goes back on the list?

55:00.998 --> 55:02.299
George.

55:02.399 --> 55:06.804
Why can you not just give one of
your kidneys to your daughter Isabella?

55:07.604 --> 55:09.640
Because I'm not a match.

55:10.040 --> 55:13.444
We tried all of our close relatives
and Deacon's the only one.

55:13.544 --> 55:15.605
He's a perfect match.

55:16.046 --> 55:18.936
Deacon's a match and you are not?

55:20.284 --> 55:22.837
That's the situation.

55:23.487 --> 55:27.155
No wonder you two are not close.

55:34.064 --> 55:35.236
Alright.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.152
There is the question of money.

55:38.252 --> 55:42.143
My doctor friend has a price
of $20,000 American.

55:42.543 --> 55:46.010
Look... Deacon, I don't have
that kind of cash on hand. Do you?

55:46.410 --> 55:48.346
George, what about you?

55:48.946 --> 55:51.279
For God's sakes, no.

55:52.583 --> 55:53.656
I do.

55:55.419 --> 55:56.952
Here.

56:00.958 --> 56:02.593
It's the money they paid me
to set you up.

56:02.693 --> 56:06.098
Take it, please, I don't want it.
Use it to help Isabella.

56:06.964 --> 56:08.297
Thank you.

56:12.670 --> 56:15.606
Okay, there's still the matter
of finding the kidney.

56:15.706 --> 56:19.774
We have no idea
where it is or who has it.

56:23.347 --> 56:25.849
Okay, think about it.

56:25.949 --> 56:29.520
A rich old man needs a kidney,
I mean desperate, right?

56:29.620 --> 56:33.457
And he knows
he's on the bottom of the list.

56:33.557 --> 56:37.111
So... so he's hiring somebody

56:37.211 --> 56:40.230
to find out who at the top
of the list is a match.

56:40.330 --> 56:41.799
And that's Isabella.

56:41.899 --> 56:45.103
Yeah, they probably paid off someone
on the hospital staff.

56:45.603 --> 56:47.071
Oh, my God. They were watching her.

56:47.171 --> 56:51.008
So when Deacon went to the hospital
for the prep test yesterday...

56:51.108 --> 56:54.111
- Yeah.
- They ID'd me as the donor.

56:54.211 --> 56:55.879
Bango.

56:55.979 --> 56:57.829
Bango?

56:59.049 --> 57:04.067
We need the list.
Whoever matches Isabella is our guy.

57:04.267 --> 57:06.922
I am familiar with such lists.

57:07.024 --> 57:09.991
It's impossible to get to.

57:12.029 --> 57:16.330
Hard but... not impossible.

57:36.921 --> 57:39.923
- How do you know this guy?
- From the university.

57:40.023 --> 57:42.627
- How do you know he can do it?
- He can do it.

57:42.927 --> 57:44.763
And he owes me.

57:50.768 --> 57:52.834
That's your guy?

57:56.039 --> 57:57.562
Yeah.

57:58.776 --> 58:02.705
Okay, I'll be right back.
Don't worry, I can do this.

58:25.536 --> 58:27.697
Who was that you drove up with?

58:28.739 --> 58:31.320
That's just my brother, Deacon.

58:31.842 --> 58:34.912
You have a brother? I didn't know that.

58:35.412 --> 58:38.015
Shocked I was to receive
such a request from yourself.

58:38.115 --> 58:42.886
As you know I'm a simple honest janitor
these days in this lovely old theater.

58:42.986 --> 58:45.990
I have this. You see that?

58:46.090 --> 58:48.992
I'm limited to one block
around my house and my work.

58:49.092 --> 58:51.762
And if I'm caught even near a computer
I go straight back to jail

58:51.862 --> 58:53.330
to serve out the rest of my sentence.

58:53.830 --> 58:57.067
- You of all people know this.
- I do.

58:57.167 --> 58:58.835
And if memory serves me correctly,

58:58.935 --> 59:02.472
you made me promise
to repent and sin no more

59:02.572 --> 59:05.275
in exchange for your testimony
for my early release.

59:05.375 --> 59:09.880
I did. Look... can we do this?

59:10.280 --> 59:14.017
I can do it. But I worry about
what you might think about me

59:14.117 --> 59:16.687
breaking my promise to Jesus, my savior.

59:16.787 --> 59:20.856
My daughter, Isabella...
she's on the recipient list.

59:25.162 --> 59:26.888
I didn't know that.

59:34.438 --> 59:38.375
George, I owe you.

59:39.209 --> 59:44.081
So listen to me.
You don't really want the list.

59:44.381 --> 59:46.383
Yes, I do.

59:46.483 --> 59:49.720
No, you don't.
You think you do, but you don't.

59:50.520 --> 59:54.191
What are you talking about?
What do I really want then?

59:54.758 --> 59:57.008
What you really want
is the name of the person

59:57.108 --> 01:00:01.348
who first tried to hire me
to hack the list. Am I right?

01:00:01.448 --> 01:00:03.900
Someone else tried to hire you
to hack the list before us?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.037
Yes. With almost
the exact same specifications.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:09.573
I said no per my promise to you,

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:11.241
but in light of the money
they were throwing around,

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:13.544
I have no doubt they eventually
found someone else.

01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:17.147
Okay. Listen to me. I really need
to know who tried to hire you.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.883
- Are you sure about this?
- Please.

01:00:23.087 --> 01:00:25.622
Okay, well, this will be
our little secret.

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:29.824
I managed to get on a computer,
did a little digging around...

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.904
Thank you.

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.610
Simon Rants III.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.645
Rich British expat
living in the Philippines.

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:52.649
Retired oil company CEO. A member
of Harmony Corp's Board of Directors.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:57.246
Same blood type. Matches five
of the six antigens of your subject...

01:00:57.646 --> 01:00:58.866
your girl.

01:00:58.966 --> 01:01:02.759
He's 76 years old,
he has a long-term undisclosed illness

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:05.462
and he has his own personal physician
with him at all times

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:09.099
at his villa on the outskirts of the South.
Rarely travels.

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:11.502
Okay, okay.
And what is this Harmony Corp?

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.404
The rather ironically named Harmony Corp

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:19.509
is one of the largest suppliers of private
military contractors in the world.

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:22.146
Private military. You mean mercenaries?

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:25.590
Well, that would be
the less poetic term, yes.

01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:34.458
Harmony Corp. Lord in heaven.

01:01:34.558 --> 01:01:36.691
They are connected to everyone.

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:42.707
They've got deep pockets,
that's for sure.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:48.981
Listen, we need to find a place
to regroup, a hotel, something.

01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:54.311
Our summer house.
It isn't far from here, you know?

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:58.215
We could... we go there.
Few people know about it.

01:01:58.315 --> 01:01:59.663
Summer house.

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:03.807
Summer house.

01:02:04.917 --> 01:02:06.393
Okay.

01:02:38.622 --> 01:02:41.157
It's Liam. That kid's amazing.

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:45.529
He actually managed to hack into the system
and get us the plans to Rants' villa.

01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:48.672
I'll go print them out. Okay?

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.570
Please... just make yourself at home.

01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:55.537
Thank you.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:15.168
That's George's wife?

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:20.375
She looks just like me.

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:26.134
- There's a reason why Drake chose you.
- Your brother's wife?

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:30.922
How could you?

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:55.192
We both loved Mary

01:03:55.292 --> 01:03:58.424
probably from the first time we met her.

01:03:59.067 --> 01:04:01.003
I knew her first.

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:04.108
I was in high school
with her in Amsterdam.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:10.781
Our dad is Scottish,
French and my mother American.

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:13.744
They divorced.

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:16.232
When...

01:04:16.909 --> 01:04:19.485
we were very young and...

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:24.744
and I went with my father
and I grew up in Europe.

01:04:26.129 --> 01:04:29.165
George lived in the States with Mother

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:33.406
but he came over in the summer
to visit Papa and me.

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:39.577
He met Mary through me.

01:04:40.327 --> 01:04:43.125
Later he came to university...

01:04:43.825 --> 01:04:45.795
but really...

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:48.606
it was to be with her.

01:04:50.787 --> 01:04:54.624
So I was the bad boy, you know?

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.460
Gang, street fights.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.797
As I got older it got worse,
more violent.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:03.198
I could not stay out of trouble.

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:08.393
Not even for Mary.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:14.927
She chose the good boy
instead of the bad one.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:17.309
I didn't understand then.

01:05:17.714 --> 01:05:20.297
Just too damn proud I guess.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.404
I was a real bastard about it.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.141
Ten years ago George and Mary...

01:05:29.241 --> 01:05:33.097
they had a problem, they separated.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.623
She and I spent time together.

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:41.972
But she went back to George
and I can't blame her for that.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:45.266
And after all, George is a good man

01:05:45.466 --> 01:05:47.016
and me, well...

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:50.668
I really am a bastard.

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:54.707
And that was it.

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:58.355
Until she found out she was pregnant.

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:00.840
And she told him the baby was yours?

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.180
She didn't have to.

01:06:04.728 --> 01:06:08.916
Because... George knew
he couldn't have children.

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:15.421
We had tried for years and, well...

01:06:15.521 --> 01:06:17.908
it's turned out I'm sterile.

01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:21.221
But you took her back? You forgave her?

01:06:21.578 --> 01:06:24.047
Of course, yeah.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:27.590
I loved her. It was easy to forgive her.

01:06:32.338 --> 01:06:34.926
Forgiving my brother on the other hand,

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.508
that was much more difficult.

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:48.447
I'm going upstairs to rest, alright?

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:24.700
Have faith.

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:55.052
C4 here and here.

01:07:55.152 --> 01:07:59.743
And we also need radio transmitters.
He's good for it?

01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:03.364
Yes, yes. He has everything
that you ordered.

01:08:03.464 --> 01:08:06.449
But, Deacon, we have
a real problem on our hands.

01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:10.887
Once again, we have hit
a financial wall.

01:08:10.987 --> 01:08:15.318
The money the girl gave us
has all been spent mostly on the doctor.

01:08:15.418 --> 01:08:19.162
The new equipment
has to be paid for up front.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:23.265
We need $50,000 American at least.

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.122
Deacon.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:27.636
I've just been thinking about this

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:30.907
and I have been praying
and we can't do this.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:34.611
Whoever has the kidney now...
we cannot kill someone for the kidney.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:37.680
Please, no more killing.
We have to stop.

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:42.421
- I knew you would do this.
- It's wrong. Everything. We can't.

01:08:42.522 --> 01:08:45.889
I'm not letting her die. Not tonight.

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:49.759
- Her fate is in God's hands now.
- No, it's not in God's hands.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:53.830
- It's in our hands. Yours and mine.
- No, our hands, they are bloody enough.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.287
Okay? So no. No more. It's over.

01:08:56.388 --> 01:09:00.868
No, it's your fault. It's your fault
she's as sick as she is, George.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.447
You waited too long to have her checked.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:08.645
Don't you do this.

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:10.564
Don't you do this.

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:13.549
She hated going to the doctor, right?

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.822
Because it reminded her
of what happened to her mother.

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:22.770
And after Mary died I could not
bring myself to make that child

01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:25.929
- do anything that she hated.
- There's more to it than that, George.

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:28.499
- No. That's all there is.
- Bullshit.

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:32.301
- I think that you're punishing Isabella.
- Don't do this.

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:35.738
Oh, yes, because there's part
of you that hates her.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.004
Please, don't.

01:09:37.104 --> 01:09:40.977
Because every time you look at her
she reminds you of me.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.917
No!

01:09:48.718 --> 01:09:52.255
She is my daughter.
I am the one that she calls Daddy

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.591
and you have no idea
how much I love that child.

01:09:54.691 --> 01:09:57.160
I love that child more
than anything in this world.

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:59.929
She's going to die tonight.
Would you give your life for her?

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:02.924
- God, of course I would.
- Yes, your life...

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.395
but not your soul.

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:11.673
Would you kill to save her
even if it damned your soul?

01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:32.309
Kung. I have the money you need.

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:41.478
There's... plenty of money
in this account.

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:44.340
And the password...

01:10:45.463 --> 01:10:49.674
is beloved. So please, take it.

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:57.273
I wasn't going to touch that money anyway.
It was from Mary's life insurance.

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:02.058
We do this together, we go all the way.

01:11:02.158 --> 01:11:03.863
No turning back, George.

01:11:03.963 --> 01:11:07.598
- Clear?
- I... am clear.

01:11:08.064 --> 01:11:12.385
If I am going to go to hell,
I might as well go down in flames.

01:11:15.004 --> 01:11:17.507
Good shot. Good chops.

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:22.645
Yeah, it's... something I should've
done a long time ago.

01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:30.464
He's right. He should have.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.923
I'm embarrassed to ask
but can I have some of that?

01:12:00.023 --> 01:12:02.150
Yes. Of course. Of course.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:07.190
I love coffee. I'd drink it
in my sleep if I could.

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:10.224
Yeah, my wife Mary, she felt the same.

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:15.565
The smell of good coffee.
We need to fuel up.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:19.168
I talked to the ammunitions guy.
He'll be ready for us in an hour.

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:23.106
We should start getting ready now.
I have a good feeling about this.

01:12:23.206 --> 01:12:27.443
We'll get through this and young Isabella
is going to be just fine.

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.830
It's amazing. Once you have money
to throw around

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:32.159
people start returning your calls.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:34.485
I need some milk.

01:12:35.485 --> 01:12:38.954
Listen, Deacon, about before...

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.831
- Did you put it there?
- No, I don't know what it is.

01:12:55.665 --> 01:12:58.008
Stay away from the windows.
Anna, kill the light.

01:12:58.308 --> 01:13:00.107
Kung, don't!

01:13:01.448 --> 01:13:02.600
Don't!

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.393
George!

01:13:50.493 --> 01:13:52.633
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:14:16.252 --> 01:14:19.244
What was it... was it Drake?

01:14:36.439 --> 01:14:38.106
Let's find him.

01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:42.085
Let's find him.

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:59.096
Kung's guy will be here any minute.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:04.100
Kung never got me any help
only equipment

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.536
which means it's only you and I.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:08.671
Are you okay with that?

01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:10.703
Yeah.

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.543
I run the op from the field.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:17.110
You run ammunition from the van.
No time for debate.

01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:19.716
When I give an order, it's a go. Clear?

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:22.885
Clear. You sure you can do this?

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:27.514
Yeah. I've done it before.
More than once.

01:15:35.498 --> 01:15:38.100
Kidnap and rescue is all fine.

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:41.470
But what I'm really good at...

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.387
is killing people.

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:49.179
- It must be hard.
- No, that's the scary thing.

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:53.615
Killing is easy. Yeah.

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:55.365
Living with it,

01:15:56.462 --> 01:15:59.401
that's... that's hard.

01:17:20.203 --> 01:17:22.254
Okay.

01:17:22.605 --> 01:17:25.779
Okay, charges all set.

01:17:25.879 --> 01:17:29.679
The charges will take out the power,
cameras and the alarm, okay?

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:32.849
Number one, watch the screen.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.784
You'll get the video feed
from my camera.

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:38.187
You'll see everything I see.

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:41.641
When I come out
you break through the gate.

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.361
With the door open,
I'll jump in and you hit the gas.

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:47.797
- You don't stop. Got it?
- Got it.

01:17:47.897 --> 01:17:50.567
- Now, Anna.
- Yes?

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:54.020
Hey! What the hell? Deacon! Deacon!

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.224
Make sure George doesn't go
into that house, no matter what.

01:17:58.324 --> 01:18:00.226
- Okay?
- Yes.

01:18:00.326 --> 01:18:01.701
Stop it.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.247
Here's the key.

01:18:17.593 --> 01:18:20.355
George, it's better this way.

01:20:40.435 --> 01:20:43.568
- Where are those lights from?
- I don't know. Backup generator?

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.076
- He took a hit.
- What do we do?

01:21:19.176 --> 01:21:21.712
It's got to be a hit to the head
because the camera's out.

01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:24.750
Wait, wait, wait.

01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:38.362
Okay, there's still firing.
Okay, that means he's still alive.

01:21:38.462 --> 01:21:40.896
Come on. I've got to do something.
Give me the key.

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:43.582
- Look, I promised I wouldn't!
- Give me the key!

01:21:43.682 --> 01:21:47.537
I can't! I promised I wouldn't!
I can't! I'm sorry.

01:22:22.654 --> 01:22:24.220
Wait...

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.511
Have you ever handled a gun?

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:40.221
My dad... our dad took us hunting, once.

01:23:41.617 --> 01:23:44.451
- Wait...
- May God forgive me.

01:24:01.237 --> 01:24:05.240
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:08.368
He leads me beside quiet waters.

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:11.024
He restores my soul.

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.509
He guides me...

01:24:21.609 --> 01:24:26.240
in paths of righteousness
for his name's sake.

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:53.008
For I walk through the valley

01:24:53.108 --> 01:24:56.882
of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil.

01:25:33.829 --> 01:25:35.113
Simon Rants?

01:25:38.567 --> 01:25:40.085
Yes.

01:25:40.185 --> 01:25:42.272
Time to go, pal.

01:25:43.038 --> 01:25:45.085
The police are on their way,

01:25:45.185 --> 01:25:48.177
unfortunately for you, you'll be dead
by the time they get here.

01:25:48.277 --> 01:25:51.195
- Let's go.
- Nice try, Deacon.

01:25:51.295 --> 01:25:53.075
How do you doing, mate?

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:56.564
Hand me the weapon
over your shoulder, slowly.

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:03.589
I never imagined you would find out
who I was much less where.

01:26:03.689 --> 01:26:07.045
It seems Drake was right
about your tenacity.

01:26:07.145 --> 01:26:10.032
He was certain you'd be a problem
for us eventually

01:26:10.132 --> 01:26:15.493
and now here you are, in my home.

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:18.774
I wanted to avoid
any killing if at all possible.

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:21.430
I'm a guest in this country after all.

01:26:22.077 --> 01:26:24.119
You leave me no choice.

01:26:24.219 --> 01:26:29.116
Which for you, lover boy
means it's time to say au revoir.

01:27:24.773 --> 01:27:28.000
He was right. It's all too easy.

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:17.893
You know what the hardest part
about this job was?

01:28:17.993 --> 01:28:22.195
The part I played where I had to pretend
that you chased me off.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.064
Step away from my brother.

01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:28.070
Now!

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:32.105
Can you really do it, George?
Can you kill a man in cold blood?

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:42.851
Shoot him in the head.

01:28:43.945 --> 01:28:46.687
- Shoot him in the head!
- Fucking jammed!

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:10.777
George. I told you to walk away.

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:16.416
That's enough, Drake.

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:34.370
- Are you ready for round 2?
- I already won the fight.

01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:37.072
- Oh, yeah?
- That blood on the floor?

01:29:37.472 --> 01:29:39.107
Mostly yours.

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:43.238
Femoral artery. You're bleeding out.

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:06.799
Game over.

01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:09.653
Game over.

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:19.379
Okay. Okay.

01:30:26.672 --> 01:30:28.345
Get up.

01:30:29.858 --> 01:30:33.862
- I want my kidney back. Come on!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:30:33.962 --> 01:30:37.600
As old as he is, he doesn't look
near in the pain that you are.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.533
Something's not right.

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:46.941
There's no transplant scar.
You're not Simon Rants.

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:49.208
It's a decoy.

01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:52.880
Where is he? Where is Simon Rants?

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:56.267
I am Simon Rants!
I am the man you're looking for!

01:30:56.367 --> 01:30:59.787
Look at the pictures on the wall!
My university certificate!

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:02.291
I tell you I am Simon Rants!

01:31:02.391 --> 01:31:05.294
Take my kidney, whatever you want!
I'll cooperate.

01:31:05.394 --> 01:31:08.964
Believe me, please.
I'm telling the truth.

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:13.419
He is Simon Rants. But...

01:31:13.819 --> 01:31:16.838
- he's not Simon Rants III.
- What?

01:31:16.938 --> 01:31:21.376
It's got to be someone else. The name
on the recipient list was Simon Rants III.

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:25.645
We have to keep on looking.
Let's try the master bedroom next door.

01:31:26.007 --> 01:31:28.796
No! Wait. Wait!

01:31:51.372 --> 01:31:53.720
Don't you move.

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:00.854
No. Please.

01:32:00.954 --> 01:32:03.241
You don't understand.

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:07.228
Please. You can't do this.

01:32:07.328 --> 01:32:09.522
He's only 11 years old.

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:29.775
You can't disturb him.
He's at a delicate stage in his graph!

01:32:32.146 --> 01:32:35.416
Don't hurt him. Please, take me.

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.352
- I'm dying anyway, please...
- Shut up!

01:32:37.752 --> 01:32:40.386
George. George.

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:44.692
He's my only grandson,
don't you understand?

01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:46.194
He was dying!

01:32:46.294 --> 01:32:48.983
- And I had to do something!
- I get it, alright?!

01:32:49.083 --> 01:32:51.858
But since there's a dying
little girl waiting for that kidney

01:32:51.958 --> 01:32:53.902
then you will understand
what I have to do.

01:32:54.102 --> 01:32:55.069
No!

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:57.672
- George!
- What!

01:32:57.972 --> 01:33:00.975
You cannot do this. This is too much.

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:03.851
- We cannot cross this line.
- We don't have a choice.

01:33:03.951 --> 01:33:07.448
Don't do this. George! Don't do this.

01:33:07.548 --> 01:33:10.785
Don't pull the trigger, please.
Don't do it. I beg you.

01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:14.620
Don't do it. George.

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.968
What would Mary think?

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:05.706
It's okay, George.

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.580
It's okay.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:11.199
It's okay, brother. It's okay.

01:34:27.929 --> 01:34:29.472
What happened? He wasn't there?

01:34:35.536 --> 01:34:38.575
He was there but it's not happening.

01:34:42.044 --> 01:34:44.066
But what about Isabella?

01:35:46.374 --> 01:35:48.354
She's so beautiful, George.

01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:54.980
We can't just let her die.

01:35:57.552 --> 01:35:59.919
It's in God's hands now.

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:05.651
I'm sorry.

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:14.253
I don't think I've heard you apologize
to anyone before, you know that?

01:36:22.676 --> 01:36:24.255
Here.

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:26.968
You want to hold her?

01:36:27.215 --> 01:36:29.184
- Want to hold her?
- No, no, no, it's okay.

01:36:30.496 --> 01:36:32.418
Come on.

01:36:33.134 --> 01:36:35.423
It's alright. It's alright, Deacon.

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:38.426
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:41.093
Just try not to wake her, okay?

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:43.553
There we go.

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:54.427
She...

01:36:55.124 --> 01:36:57.055
She's really something?

01:37:01.048 --> 01:37:04.436
- Daddy? Daddy?
- It's okay. It's okay, pumpkin.

01:37:04.536 --> 01:37:07.955
See this fellow right here,
you know who he is?

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:10.095
He is your Uncle Deacon.

01:37:11.925 --> 01:37:17.472
- Uncle Deacon? From the pictures?
- Oh, yeah. The one and only.

01:37:17.572 --> 01:37:20.768
This is the surprise
I was telling you about.

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:24.458
I'm so sorry it took such a long time
before I came to see you.

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.109
I love you.

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:50.589
- It's time to go to Daddy.
- I've always wanted to meet you.

01:37:51.732 --> 01:37:52.967
Me too.

01:37:53.668 --> 01:37:57.538
I know you from the pictures
and Mama talked about you.

01:37:57.638 --> 01:38:00.742
Yeah, your Mama
was a special person, you know?

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:04.286
She was beautiful like you.

01:38:06.128 --> 01:38:08.582
Okay. Listen, you know what?

01:38:08.682 --> 01:38:11.596
You just got up so you know
what you have to do.

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:16.057
Yeah, bathroom. I know.

01:38:16.157 --> 01:38:17.390
Let's go. Come on.

01:38:26.744 --> 01:38:29.522
Deacon, were you cut?
Have you been bleeding all this time?

01:38:34.525 --> 01:38:35.943
This much blood?

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:39.209
Uncle Deacon, can't you stay?

01:38:39.309 --> 01:38:41.716
Yeah, I would love to,
but I've got to go, baby.

01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:44.151
I've got to go.

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.888
Deacon, just hang on.
I'm going to get a nurse, okay?

01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:50.191
- George, you're such a good man.
- Deacon, hang on...

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:54.261
My other kidney. Put it to good use.

01:38:54.361 --> 01:38:55.830
Deacon, please.

01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:58.057
Please, do this for me.
Do me this favor.

01:38:58.332 --> 01:39:00.935
Let me give the other kidney
to her, come on.

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:03.838
No, D. No.
I'm gonna go get you a doctor.

01:39:03.938 --> 01:39:07.134
George, I'm dying.

01:39:07.842 --> 01:39:10.230
I'm dying, George.

01:39:10.330 --> 01:39:12.395
- Come here.
- What?

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:16.584
- You're such a good person.
- Come on, Deacon, please.

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:17.822
Just...

01:39:18.486 --> 01:39:23.129
Deacon, please, I forgive you.
You don't have to.

01:39:23.229 --> 01:39:25.033
George.

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:29.255
- Feel good.
- What?

01:39:38.506 --> 01:39:40.274
Uncle Deacon?

01:39:40.765 --> 01:39:44.878
Isabella, listen, just give your Daddy
and Uncle Deacon just a minute, okay?

01:39:44.978 --> 01:39:48.216
We're going to talk about some grown up
stuff, all right? I'll be really quick.

01:39:48.316 --> 01:39:51.994
Dad, come on. I want to talk to him.

01:39:52.553 --> 01:39:54.922
- Dad!
- Nurse! Nurse!

01:39:55.022 --> 01:39:56.912
Dad!

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:19.647
Is Mama watching us from heaven?

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:22.016
You always ask that.

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:24.342
Of course she is.

01:40:32.426 --> 01:40:35.294
Is Uncle Deacon watching us from heaven?

01:40:39.066 --> 01:40:40.647
I sure hope so.

01:40:41.368 --> 01:40:43.235
I really do.

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:53.241
Let's go.
