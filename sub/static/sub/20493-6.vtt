WEBVTT

00:06.900 --> 00:08.867
TONIGHT ON THE PROFIT...
 I GO

00:06.900 --> 00:08.867
INSIDE MR. GREEN TEA, A

00:08.867 --> 00:12.700
SECOND-GENERATION, FAMILY-RUN

00:08.867 --> 00:12.700
ICE CREAM BUSINESS THAT HAS HIT

00:12.700 --> 00:15.433
A WALL.

00:12.700 --> 00:15.433
 WE PHYSICALLY CANNOT FILL OUR

00:15.433 --> 00:18.500
ORDERS TO THE DISTRIBUTORS.

00:15.433 --> 00:18.500
 THE FIERY DYNAMIC BETWEEN THE

00:18.500 --> 00:21.600
FATHER AND SON IS HURTING ANY

00:18.500 --> 00:21.600
CHANCE OF GROWTH.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.600
 YOU ARE STRANGLING THE

00:21.600 --> 00:23.600
BUSINESS.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.967
 BACK UP.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.967
YOU'RE CROSSING THE LINE BETWEEN

00:25.967 --> 00:30.500
FATHER AND BOSS.

00:25.967 --> 00:30.500
 IF I CAN'T FIX THEIR

00:30.500 --> 00:28.433
COMPANY WILL BE SWALLOWED BY A

00:30.500 --> 00:28.433
COMPETITOR.

00:28.433 --> 00:35.200
RELATIONSHIP AND BUSINESS, THIS

00:28.433 --> 00:35.200
MY NAME IS MARCUS LEMONIS, AND I

00:35.200 --> 00:38.533
FIX FAILING BUSINESSES.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.533
THIS BUSINESS WILL NEVER

00:38.533 --> 00:41.167
FUNCTION WELL UNDER THE

00:38.533 --> 00:41.167
"GREEN TEA" NAME.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.867
I MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS...

00:41.167 --> 00:43.867
 IT WAS A MISTAKE.

00:43.867 --> 00:48.400
 THIS IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN

00:43.867 --> 00:48.400
AGAIN.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.433
AND BACK THEM UP WITH MY OWN

00:48.400 --> 00:50.433
CASH.

00:50.433 --> 00:53.500
THAT'S A REAL CHECK, BY THE WAY.

00:50.433 --> 00:53.500
IT'S NOT ALWAYS PRETTY...

00:53.500 --> 00:54.900
 DO YOU WANT TO COME OVER

00:53.500 --> 00:54.900
HERE?

00:54.900 --> 00:58.633
 NO.

00:54.900 --> 00:58.633
 BUT THIS IS BUSINESS.

00:58.633 --> 01:03.833
I DO IT TO SAVE JOBS, AND I DO

00:58.633 --> 01:03.833
IT TO MAKE MONEY.

01:03.833 --> 01:14.000
 THE PROFIT.

01:05.099 --> 01:14.000
[upbeat music]

01:06.100 --> 01:14.000
? 

01:15.333 --> 01:18.700
THIS WEEK, I'M GOING TO

01:15.333 --> 01:18.700
KEYPORT, NEW JERSEY, A TOWN THAT

01:18.700 --> 01:22.500
WAS DEVASTATED BY

01:18.700 --> 01:22.500
HURRICANE SANDY IN 2012.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.833
I'M GOING TO MEET THE OWNERS OF

01:22.500 --> 01:25.833
MR. GREEN TEA, A GOURMET

01:25.833 --> 01:29.033
ICE CREAM COMPANY.

01:25.833 --> 01:29.033
FOR NEARLY 50 YEARS,

01:29.033 --> 01:32.067
MR. GREEN TEA HAS BEEN

01:29.033 --> 01:32.067
HAND-CRAFTING EXOTIC ICE CREAM

01:32.067 --> 01:35.533
FLAVORS AND SUPPLYING THE ASIAN

01:32.067 --> 01:35.533
RESTAURANT TRADE IN

01:35.533 --> 01:38.033
NEW YORK CITY.

01:35.533 --> 01:38.033
 SO DELICIOUS.

01:38.033 --> 01:43.600
 WAY AHEAD OF THEIR TIME,

01:38.033 --> 01:43.600
FLAVORS LIKE GREEN TEA, GINGER,

01:43.600 --> 01:46.667
AND RED BEAN.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.667
THIS FAMILY BUSINESS WAS FOUNDED

01:46.667 --> 01:39.800
BY RICHARD'S DAD,

01:46.667 --> 01:39.800
SANTO EMANUELE, IN 1968, WHO RAN

01:39.800 --> 01:52.967
MR. GREEN TEA WAS PRODUCING

01:39.800 --> 01:52.967
IT WITH RICHARD'S OLDER BROTHER,

01:52.967 --> 01:56.067
JAMES.

01:52.967 --> 01:56.067
RICHARD'S DAD PASSED AWAY, AND

01:56.067 --> 01:59.467
THEN HIS BROTHER DIED

01:56.067 --> 01:59.467
UNEXPECTEDLY, LEAVING RICHARD TO

01:59.467 --> 02:02.233
RUN THE BUSINESS.

01:59.467 --> 02:02.233
RICHARD WANTED TO KEEP HIS

02:02.233 --> 02:05.333
FAMILY LEGACY ALIVE, SO HE TOOK

02:02.233 --> 02:05.333
OVER THE BUSINESS AND BROUGHT

02:05.333 --> 02:08.467
HIS SON, MICHAEL, WITH HIM.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.467
 MICHAEL, THERE'S MULTIPLE

02:08.467 --> 02:12.133
PROBLEMS.

02:08.467 --> 02:12.133
WE GOTTA DO WHAT WE GOTTA DO.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.767
I HELP, MR. GREEN TEA ISN'T

02:12.133 --> 02:15.767
FACING A CRISIS.

02:15.767 --> 02:19.967
THEY GENERATED OVER $2.5 MILLION

02:15.767 --> 02:19.967
A YEAR IN REVENUE, AND THE

02:19.967 --> 02:21.467
EMANUELES MAKE A VERY GOOD

02:19.967 --> 02:21.467
 UNLIKE MANY OF THE BUSINESSES

02:21.467 --> 02:25.100
LIVING, BUT THE BUSINESS IS

02:21.467 --> 02:25.100
STATIC.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.500
 I HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME

02:25.100 --> 02:27.500
MAKING THIS DECISION.

02:27.500 --> 02:30.767
 THE EMANUELES CAN'T SEEM TO

02:27.500 --> 02:30.767
AGREE ON A PLAN FOR THEIR

02:30.767 --> 02:33.933
FUTURE.

02:30.767 --> 02:33.933
MICHAEL HAS BIG IDEAS, BUT

02:33.933 --> 02:38.667
RICHARD ALWAYS PLAYS IT SAFE,

02:33.933 --> 02:38.667
AND THAT CREATES TENSION.

02:38.667 --> 02:40.300
 IT'S NOT 75.

02:38.667 --> 02:40.300
JUST GET--

02:40.300 --> 02:42.233
 DON'T MINCE MY WORDS.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.233
I HATE THAT.

02:42.233 --> 02:46.267
 I BELIEVE THAT MR. GREEN TEA

02:42.233 --> 02:46.267
CAN BE A $50-MILLION COMPANY.

02:46.267 --> 02:49.833
THEY NEED TO BE BOLD, AND THEY

02:46.267 --> 02:49.833
NEED TO TAKE CHANCES.

02:49.833 --> 02:54.300
THEY HAVEN'T LAUNCHED NEW

02:49.833 --> 02:54.300
THEY'RE STILL NOT WELL-SITUATED

02:54.300 --> 02:55.867
IN THE RETAIL MARKET.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.867
FLAVORS IN OVER A DECADE, AND

02:55.867 --> 03:02.100
THE ICE CREAM BUSINESS GENERATES

02:57.467 --> 03:02.100
WELL OVER $10 BILLION A YEAR.

02:59.733 --> 03:02.100
I WANT A TASTE OF IT.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.667
 HELLO.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.667
 HI.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.200
 I'M MARCUS.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.200
 HI, MARCUS, NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:12.200 --> 03:10.000
I'M LORI.

03:12.200 --> 03:10.000
 NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.300
 HI.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.300
ARE YOU LORI--ARE YOU MOM?

03:14.300 --> 03:16.433
 I'M MOM.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.433
 I WORE GREEN BECAUSE I WANTED

03:16.433 --> 03:17.867
TO--

03:16.433 --> 03:17.867
 YOU'RE GONNA FIT RIGHT IN.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.200
 I WORE GREEN.

03:17.867 --> 03:19.200
 [laughs]

03:19.200 --> 03:20.733
 I'D LOVE TO MEET EVERYBODY.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.733
 WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET--SURE,

03:20.733 --> 03:22.100
COME ON IN.

03:20.733 --> 03:22.100
 YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.433
 THIS IS MARCUS.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.433
 HEY, GUYS.

03:23.433 --> 03:24.833
 HI.

03:23.433 --> 03:24.833
 HOW ARE YOU? I'M MARCUS.

03:24.833 --> 03:26.233
 THIS IS DICK, DICK'S OUR

03:24.833 --> 03:26.233
OPERATIONS MANAGER.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.367
 I'M DICK, NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.367
 THIS IS MY SON, MICHAEL.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.700
 NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.700
 AND MY HUSBAND, RICH.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.033
 HI, MARCUS.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.033
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:31.033 --> 03:27.700
 HOW ARE YOU?

03:31.033 --> 03:27.700
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:27.700 --> 03:33.033
 NICE TO MEET YOU, MIKE.

03:27.700 --> 03:33.033
 HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.400
 YOU TOO.

03:33.033 --> 03:34.400
SO, RICH, TELL ME A LITTLE BIT

03:34.400 --> 03:36.567
ABOUT THE HISTORY OF

03:34.400 --> 03:36.567
MR. GREEN TEA.

03:36.567 --> 03:39.300
 WELL, YOU KNOW, MY DAD

03:36.567 --> 03:39.300
STARTED THIS BUSINESS, YOU KNOW,

03:39.300 --> 03:42.133
45, 50 YEARS AGO.

03:39.300 --> 03:42.133
 HE'S THE REAL MR. GREEN TEA.

03:42.133 --> 03:45.033
 HE SAW THE NEED OF

03:42.133 --> 03:45.033
HIGH-QUALITY ICE CREAM FOR THE

03:45.033 --> 03:47.833
RESTAURANTS.

03:45.033 --> 03:47.833
HE HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS ALSO IN

03:47.833 --> 03:50.433
THE ICE CREAM BUSINESS, AND

03:47.833 --> 03:50.433
MY DAD BELIEVED YOU GOTTA SELL

03:50.433 --> 03:53.733
TO FOOD SERVICE--TO RESTAURANTS,

03:50.433 --> 03:53.733
AND HIS FRIEND BELIEVED YOU

03:53.733 --> 03:56.867
GOTTA SELL TO GROCERY STORES.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.867
MY DAD WENT HIS WAY, FOUNDED

03:56.867 --> 03:59.767
MR. GREEN TEA, AND PUT IT INTO

03:56.867 --> 03:59.767
RESTAURANTS, AND REUBEN WENT HIS

03:59.767 --> 04:04.433
WAY AND FOUNDED HAAGEN-DAZS.

03:59.767 --> 04:04.433
SO, YOU KNOW.

04:04.433 --> 04:05.767
YOU SEE WHO ACTUALLY HAD THE

04:04.433 --> 04:05.767
BETTER IDEA.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.667
 HAAGEN-DAZS AS IN--

04:05.767 --> 04:07.667
AS IN THE HAAGEN-DAZS,

04:07.667 --> 04:10.000
MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR ICE CREAM?

04:07.667 --> 04:10.000
 EXACTLY.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.167
 DO YOU HAVE HIS NUMBER?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.167
MAYBE I CAN GO DO SOME BUSINESS

04:12.167 --> 04:14.167
 WELL--

04:12.167 --> 04:14.167
[laughter]

04:14.167 --> 04:15.433
 I LIKE THIS STORY BECAUSE

04:14.167 --> 04:15.433
WITH HIM.

04:15.433 --> 04:18.966
IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF BEING

04:15.433 --> 04:18.966
WILLING TO TAKE RISKS.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.767
IN THE CASE OF MR. GREEN TEA,

04:18.966 --> 04:21.767
THEY LIKE TO GET UP TO THE PLATE

04:21.767 --> 04:24.900
AND HIT SINGLES, AND IN THE CASE

04:21.767 --> 04:24.900
OF HAAGEN-DAZS, THEY WERE

04:24.900 --> 04:27.500
SWINGING FOR THE FENCES, AND

04:24.900 --> 04:27.500
THEY TOOK THE BIGGEST RISK OF

04:27.500 --> 04:30.200
ALL.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.200
THEY WERE WILLING TO STRIKE OUT.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.333
IN THIS CASE, THEY HIT A HOME

04:30.200 --> 04:32.333
RUN.

04:32.333 --> 04:36.233
IF WE CAN GET MR. GREEN TEA TO

04:32.333 --> 04:36.233
TAKE THE SAME SORT OF RISK, THEN

04:36.233 --> 04:39.267
THEY CAN BE AS SUCCESSFUL, MAYBE

04:36.233 --> 04:39.267
EVEN MORE.

04:39.267 --> 04:42.800
WHAT'S THE TOP LINE TODAY?

04:39.267 --> 04:42.800
 WE'RE ON TRACK TO BREAK

04:42.800 --> 04:44.333
2 MILLION THIS YEAR.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.333
 OKAY.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.167
SO IT'S A SMALL BUSINESS...

04:44.333 --> 04:46.167
 IT'S SMALL.

04:46.167 --> 04:48.800
 BUT A DECENT MARGIN BUSINESS.

04:46.167 --> 04:48.800
 COMFORTABLE, BUT--EXACTLY.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.400
 DO YOU MAKE THE ICE CREAM

04:48.800 --> 04:51.400
HERE ON THE PREMISES?

04:51.400 --> 04:54.133
 NO, WE DON'T ACTUALLY MAKE

04:51.400 --> 04:54.133
ANYTHING HERE.

04:54.133 --> 04:57.967
WE USE CO-PACKERS, A FEW AROUND

04:54.133 --> 04:57.967
THE TRI-STATE AREA, AND WE

04:57.967 --> 04:59.167
TRAVEL TO THE CO-PACKERS WHEN WE

04:57.967 --> 04:59.167
 YEAH.

04:59.167 --> 05:01.900
NEED TO MANUFACTURE, MAKE SURE

04:59.167 --> 05:01.900
THEY'RE TO OUR QUALITY CONTROL.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.533
 WHAT DOES THAT COST TO GO

05:01.900 --> 05:03.533
THERE?

05:03.533 --> 05:06.667
 A LOT.

05:03.533 --> 05:06.667
ANYWHERE BETWEEN 20% AND 30%,

05:06.667 --> 05:08.900
YEAH.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.900
 CO-PACKERS ARE THIRD-PARTY

05:08.900 --> 05:12.333
VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE AND

05:08.900 --> 05:12.333
PRODUCE PRODUCT FOR SMALL

05:12.333 --> 05:15.367
COMPANIES.

05:12.333 --> 05:15.367
MR. GREEN TEA GIVES UP ABOUT 20%

05:15.367 --> 05:18.300
MARGIN BY USING CO-PACKERS

05:15.367 --> 05:18.300
BECAUSE THEY DON'T PRODUCE THE

05:18.300 --> 05:22.767
PRODUCT THEMSELVES.

05:18.300 --> 05:22.767
20% MARGIN ON $2 1/2 MILLION OF

05:22.767 --> 05:04.367
REVENUE MEANS THEY'RE GIVING UP

05:06.000 --> 05:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:22.767 --> 05:04.367
ABOUT $1/2 MILLION A YEAR IN

05:04.367 --> 05:28.100
 I'LL BET YOU THEY ARE

05:04.367 --> 05:28.100
POTENTIAL PROFIT BY NOT MAKING

05:28.100 --> 05:32.100
THE PRODUCT THEMSELVES.

05:28.100 --> 05:32.100
 WE HAVE GROWN 20% EVERY

05:32.100 --> 05:35.800
SINGLE YEAR FOR THE LAST FIVE OR

05:32.100 --> 05:35.800
SIX YEARS, AND THE ONLY REASON

05:35.800 --> 05:38.267
WE'RE NOT GROWING MORE,

05:35.800 --> 05:38.267
ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR, IS WE

05:38.267 --> 05:41.000
PHYSICALLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH

05:38.267 --> 05:41.000
ICE CREAM.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.333
THERE'S LOGISTICS IN THE

05:41.000 --> 05:43.333
MANUFACTURING AND GETTING THE

05:43.333 --> 05:45.400
PRODUCT HERE.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.400
 AND FOR THAT MATTER, SINCE WE

05:45.400 --> 05:48.433
CAN'T FILL CERTAIN ORDERS, WE'RE

05:45.400 --> 05:48.433
ONES.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.067
 RIGHT.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.067
 ONE OF THE OTHER

05:50.067 --> 05:52.833
DISADVANTAGES OF USING A

05:50.067 --> 05:52.833
CO-PACKER IS THAT YOU DON'T

05:52.833 --> 05:55.000
CONTROL THE MANUFACTURING

05:52.833 --> 05:55.000
PROCESS.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.733
THAT CO-PACKER COULD HAVE 50 TO

05:55.000 --> 05:58.733
100 OTHER CUSTOMERS, SO YOU'RE

05:58.733 --> 06:02.400
ALLOCATED ONE TIME SLOT.

05:58.733 --> 06:02.400
IF YOUR BUSINESS GROWS AND YOU

06:02.400 --> 06:05.200
DON'T HAVE MORE TIME SLOTS

06:02.400 --> 06:05.200
AVAILABLE WITH THIS CO-PACKER,

06:05.200 --> 06:07.200
IT WON'T MATTER HOW MANY ORDERS

06:05.200 --> 06:07.200
YOU GET.

06:07.200 --> 05:46.400
THERE'S NO TIME SLOTS.

06:07.200 --> 05:46.400
THERE'S NO WAY TO MAKE YOUR

05:46.400 --> 06:10.233
NOT ACTIVELY GOING INTO NEW

05:46.400 --> 06:10.233
PRODUCT.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.733
THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.733
 WE WANT TO BUILD A FACILITY

06:12.733 --> 06:14.733
AND BRING ALL THE MANUFACTURING

06:12.733 --> 06:14.733
UNDER ONE ROOF.

06:14.733 --> 06:16.367
 AND WHAT'S HELD YOU BACK FROM

06:14.733 --> 06:16.367
DOING IT?

06:16.367 --> 06:18.767
 WELL, I KNOW--OBVIOUSLY, YOU

06:16.367 --> 06:18.767
GET WORRIED.

06:18.767 --> 06:21.067
YOU KNOW, I'M VERY, VERY

06:18.767 --> 06:21.067
CONSERVATIVE, AND MAYBE EVEN TOO

06:21.067 --> 06:23.433
MUCH.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.433
 CONSERVATIVE TO A FAULT.

06:23.433 --> 06:25.333
 WHY IS THAT A BAD THING?

06:23.433 --> 06:25.333
 WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

06:25.333 --> 06:27.633
PUTTING UP A NEW FACILITY FOR A

06:25.333 --> 06:27.633
LONG TIME NOW, AND IT'S JUST

06:27.633 --> 06:29.500
GOING SLOWER THAN--

06:27.633 --> 06:29.500
 YEAH, BUT--

06:29.500 --> 06:30.900
 IN MY OPINION, IT SHOULD--

06:29.500 --> 06:30.900
 BUT THE THING IS, IT--IT--

06:30.900 --> 06:33.500
YOU NEED THE BUSINESS THERE.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.500
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA PUT A

06:33.500 --> 06:36.267
FACILITY UP UNLESS I KNOW WE

06:33.500 --> 06:36.267
HAVE THAT MUCH GROWTH--

06:36.267 --> 06:37.733
 IT'S THE CHICK--IT'S THE

06:36.267 --> 06:37.733
CHICKEN OR THE EGG.

06:37.733 --> 06:40.733
 EXACTLY--COMING IN.

06:37.733 --> 06:40.733
 WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT,

06:40.733 --> 06:45.800
THINKING ABOUT THIS BUSINESS?

06:40.733 --> 06:45.800
 UM, MAKING A WRONG DECISION,

06:45.800 --> 06:49.100
WHICH WOULD IMPACT THE COMPANY

06:45.800 --> 06:49.100
AND THE EMPLOYEES.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.133
 AND HOW ABOUT YOU, MICHAEL,

06:49.100 --> 06:51.133
WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT?

06:51.133 --> 06:56.200
 I THINK WE LOSE OUT ON THE

06:51.133 --> 06:56.200
POTENTIAL HERE OF THE COMPANY BY

06:56.200 --> 06:58.233
NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.233
 THOSE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT

06:58.233 --> 07:01.467
PHILOSOPHIES, 'CAUSE ONE IS A

06:58.233 --> 07:01.467
LITTLE LIKE, YOU KNOW, "I'M NOT

07:01.467 --> 07:04.033
GONNA GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE

07:01.467 --> 07:04.033
EDGE," AND YOU ARE JUST

07:04.033 --> 07:06.167
WONDERING, "HOW CLOSE CAN I GET

07:04.033 --> 07:06.167
TO THE EDGE WITHOUT BEING

07:06.167 --> 07:07.567
DEADLY?"

07:06.167 --> 07:07.567
 YEAH.

07:07.567 --> 07:09.933
 ACTUALLY, MICHAEL IS LIKE,

07:07.567 --> 07:09.933
"CAN I ACTUALLY JUMP OVER THE

07:09.933 --> 07:11.333
EDGE AND MAKE IT TO THE OTHER

07:09.933 --> 07:11.333
SIDE?"

07:11.333 --> 07:12.833
 TELL YOU, LISTEN, IT'S A--

07:11.333 --> 07:12.833
THE FOOD INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE

07:12.833 --> 07:14.967
MOST BRUTAL INDUSTRIES.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.967
 MICHAEL, YOU'RE TRYING TO

07:14.967 --> 07:16.767
DEFEND YOURSELF, BUT THERE'S NO

07:14.967 --> 07:16.767
DEFENSE.

07:16.767 --> 07:18.933
 YOU CAN'T HAVE A--LET ME F--

07:16.767 --> 07:18.933
LET ME FINISH.

07:18.933 --> 07:20.867
SIX OR SEVEN YEARS AGO...

07:18.933 --> 07:20.867
 SEVEN YEARS AGO, YEAH.

07:20.867 --> 07:24.367
 WHEN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS, YOU

07:20.867 --> 07:24.367
COULDN'T POSSIBLY OUTGROW THIS

07:24.367 --> 07:30.100
FACILITY, WE'RE THERE.

07:24.367 --> 07:30.100
IN MY OPINION, MR. GREEN TEA IS

07:30.100 --> 07:33.167
NOT NEARLY AS LUCRATIVE OR

07:30.100 --> 07:33.167
PROFITABLE AS IT SHOULD BE.

07:33.167 --> 07:37.200
I'M AFRAID THAT IF WE DON'T

07:33.167 --> 07:37.200
HURRY UP ALONG OUR PATH, THAT A

07:37.200 --> 07:39.533
BIGGER COMPANY, ONE OF THE MAJOR

07:37.200 --> 07:39.533
GUYS, WILL COME ALONG AND SQUASH

07:39.533 --> 07:45.033
US.

07:39.533 --> 07:45.033
 THIS IS THE TEST KITCHEN

07:45.033 --> 07:48.433
AREA.

07:45.033 --> 07:48.433
 WHAT WE DO IN HERE IS TEST

07:48.433 --> 07:51.400
OUR SUPPLY OF MILK, SUGAR,

07:48.433 --> 07:51.400
CREAM, AND INGREDIENTS, AND MAKE

07:51.400 --> 07:53.200
SURE THAT THE SUPPLIERS ARE

07:51.400 --> 07:53.200
GIVING US THE SAME ONE EVERY

07:53.200 --> 07:55.133
WEEK.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.133
WE HAVE THREE SKUs.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.233
WE HAVE THE GREEN TEA,

07:55.133 --> 07:57.233
THE RED BEAN, AND THE GINGER.

07:57.233 --> 07:58.733
WE'LL START WITH THIS,

07:57.233 --> 07:58.733
THE GREEN TEA.

07:58.733 --> 08:02.200
THIS IS OUR TOP SELLER.

07:58.733 --> 08:02.200
YEAH, HENCE THE NAME,

08:02.200 --> 08:03.633
"MR. GREEN TEA."

08:02.200 --> 08:03.633
 LOOK AT THE COLOR.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.567
 IT'S BEEN THE TOP SELLER FOR

08:03.633 --> 08:05.567
WHAT, 45 YEARS?

08:05.567 --> 08:09.233
 YEAH.

08:05.567 --> 08:09.233
 THAT GREEN TEA'S GOOD.

08:09.233 --> 08:11.667
 ISN'T IT GOOD?

08:09.233 --> 08:11.667
 MR. GREEN TEA CURRENTLY MAKES

08:11.667 --> 08:14.300
THREE PINT FLAVORS, AND AFTER

08:11.667 --> 08:14.300
BEING IN BUSINESS FOR THIS MANY

08:14.300 --> 08:16.467
YEARS, WELL, THAT'S NOT GOOD

08:14.300 --> 08:16.467
ENOUGH.

08:16.467 --> 08:19.367
I WANT TO SEE THEM EXPAND THEIR

08:16.467 --> 08:19.367
PRODUCT OFFERING, EXPAND THEIR

08:19.367 --> 08:22.500
FLAVORS, AND APPEAL TO A MUCH

08:19.367 --> 08:22.500
BROADER AUDIENCE.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.467
WHAT DOES IT COST TO LAUNCH, TO

08:22.500 --> 08:25.467
DEVELOP A NEW FLAVOR?

08:25.467 --> 08:27.000
 A LOT.

08:25.467 --> 08:27.000
 BETWEEN THE MILK AND

08:27.000 --> 08:30.967
EVERYTHING, WE'LL GO TO A

08:27.000 --> 08:30.967
FACILITY, HAVE IT RUN, AND TEST

08:30.967 --> 08:33.433
IT.

08:30.967 --> 08:33.433
THAT GETS EXPENSIVE.

08:33.433 --> 08:37.600
I'M GONNA SAY $10,000.

08:33.433 --> 08:37.600
 LAUNCHING A NEW PRODUCT LINE

08:37.600 --> 08:40.832
IS A COSTLY INVESTMENT, AND IT'S

08:37.600 --> 08:40.832
RISKY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE

08:40.832 --> 08:43.200
DEALING WITH CO-PACKERS, 'CAUSE

08:40.832 --> 08:43.200
THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE YOU A

08:43.200 --> 08:46.400
FORTUNE TO MAKE A SMALL BATCH.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.400
 IF WE WANTED TO GET INTO,

08:46.400 --> 08:49.300
LET'S SAY, A HUNDRED STORES THIS

08:46.400 --> 08:49.300
YEAR, IN 2013, IT'D PROBABLY

08:49.300 --> 08:51.433
COST US ABOUT $40,000 TO

08:49.300 --> 08:51.433
$50,000.

08:51.433 --> 08:53.467
 SEE, I THINK MORE THAN THAT,

08:51.433 --> 08:53.467
BECAUSE--

08:53.467 --> 08:55.833
 DO THE TWO OF YOU COMMUNICATE

08:53.467 --> 08:55.833
ABOUT THESE NUMBERS VERY OFTEN?

08:55.833 --> 08:59.100
 MICHAEL DOES NOT DO THE

08:55.833 --> 08:59.100
NUMBERS ON AN EVERYDAY BASIS

08:59.100 --> 09:00.600
LIKE I DO.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.600
 IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR

09:00.600 --> 09:02.567
NUMBERS, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW

09:00.600 --> 09:02.567
YOUR BUSINESS.

09:02.567 --> 09:05.000
I MEAN, IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

09:02.567 --> 09:05.000
 I KNOW MY NUMBERS.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.333
 YOU KNOW YOUR NUMBERS?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.333
 I KNOW MY NUMBERS.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.667
 OKAY.

09:06.333 --> 09:07.667
 ABSOLUTELY.

09:07.667 --> 09:10.667
 IF AN INVESTMENT'S GONNA BE

09:07.667 --> 09:10.667
MADE, NUMBERS ARE EVERYTHING.

09:10.667 --> 09:13.367
LOOK, RICHARD IS ALL ABOUT THE

09:10.667 --> 09:13.367
NUMBERS, AND HE LEAVES VERY

09:13.367 --> 09:16.567
LITTLE MARGIN FOR ERROR, AND

09:13.367 --> 09:16.567
MICHAEL HAS BIG IDEAS, BUT HE

09:16.567 --> 09:19.633
DOESN'T PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO

09:16.567 --> 09:19.633
THE NUMBERS, AND THAT COULD LEAD

09:19.633 --> 09:21.833
TO BIG PROBLEMS.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.833
I NOTICED ON THE WEBSITE THAT

09:21.833 --> 09:24.200
YOU ALSO HAVE SOME MOCHI.

09:21.833 --> 09:24.200
 YEAH.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.133
 THIS IS A MOCHI.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.133
YEAH, THEY COME INDIVIDUALLY

09:26.133 --> 09:27.967
WRAPPED.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.967
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF ICE CREAM

09:27.967 --> 09:30.867
WITH A SWEET RICE DOUGH ON THE

09:27.967 --> 09:30.867
OUTSIDE.

09:30.867 --> 09:32.267
 I TELL PEOPLE IT'S LIKE A

09:30.867 --> 09:32.267
RAVIOLI.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.067
 SO THIS DOUGH IS--

09:32.267 --> 09:34.067
YOU WERE SAYING--

09:34.067 --> 09:35.400
 IS SWEET RICE FLOUR.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.400
 SWEET RICE.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.800
 LIKE A RAVIOLI OF ICE CREAM.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.800
 THIS ONE I BELIEVE IS

09:36.800 --> 09:38.133
BLACK SESAME.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.133
 IT IS BLACK SESAME.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.533
 YUP.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.533
 WHOA.

09:39.533 --> 09:42.333
I'VE NEVER SEEN IT INDIVIDUALLY

09:39.533 --> 09:42.333
WRAPPED IN THIS PACKAGE.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.333
WOW.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.333
 ISN'T IT GOOD?

09:44.333 --> 09:50.367
 IT'D BE INTERESTING TO FIGURE

09:45.533 --> 09:50.367
OUT A WAY TO RETAIL THIS.

09:47.467 --> 09:50.367
 I AGREE.

09:54.867 --> 09:59.000
 MR. GREEN TEA'S PRODUCTS ARE

09:54.867 --> 09:59.000
ABOUT THEIR PROCESS AND THEIR

09:59.000 --> 10:00.433
DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.433
GREAT, BUT I NEED TO KNOW MORE

10:00.433 --> 10:01.933
WALK ME THROUGH THE LOGISTICS

10:00.433 --> 10:01.933
HERE.

10:01.933 --> 10:04.233
WHAT IS THIS SPACE HERE, AND YOU

10:01.933 --> 10:04.233
KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS HERE?

10:04.233 --> 10:07.233
 OKAY, HERE WE HAVE THE

10:04.233 --> 10:07.233
FREEZERS WHERE WE KEEP A LOT OF

10:07.233 --> 10:09.233
THE STOCK.

10:07.233 --> 10:09.233
 HOW DOES THE PRODUCT GET FROM

10:09.233 --> 10:11.633
THE CO-PACKER TO HERE?

10:09.233 --> 10:11.633
 WE PICK IT UP.

10:11.633 --> 10:14.967
THERE'S THREE TRUCKS.

10:11.633 --> 10:14.967
YOU KNOW, IT'S A CONSTANT

10:14.967 --> 10:16.867
MOVEMENT OF PRODUCT.

10:14.967 --> 10:16.867
 IT'S GOTTA COST A LOT TO DO

10:16.867 --> 10:18.900
THAT.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.900
 IT'S VERY INTRICATE, BECAUSE

10:18.900 --> 10:21.333
IF YOU MISS ONE DAY, IT'S A

10:18.900 --> 10:21.333
CHAIN REACTION THAT SCREWS

10:21.333 --> 10:22.667
EVERYTHING UP.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.667
 SO THIS IS WHERE ALL THE

10:22.667 --> 10:24.300
INVENTORY'S KEPT?

10:22.667 --> 10:24.300
 RIGHT HERE.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.567
 SO WHAT IS THERE, ONE OR

10:24.300 --> 10:26.567
TWO WEEKS' SUPPLY IN HERE?

10:26.567 --> 10:29.333
 UH, PROBABLY ABOUT A WEEK

10:26.567 --> 10:29.333
RIGHT NOW.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.233
 I'LL GIVE YOU A LOT OF

10:29.333 --> 10:31.233
CREDIT, IT LOOKS ORGANIZED, IT

10:31.233 --> 10:33.367
LOOKS RIGHT.

10:31.233 --> 10:33.367
YET ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH

10:33.367 --> 10:35.600
CO-PACKERS.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.600
WE'RE BURNING A LOT OF MONEY

10:35.600 --> 10:38.000
TRANSPORTING PRODUCT FROM THE

10:35.600 --> 10:38.000
CO-PACKER TO OUR STORAGE

10:38.000 --> 10:41.133
FACILITY.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.133
WE NEED TO BUILD A FACTORY RIGHT

10:41.133 --> 10:43.100
AWAY.

10:41.133 --> 10:43.100
HOW MUCH MONEY DOES THIS

10:43.100 --> 10:45.933
BUSINESS NEED TO GO TO THE NEXT

10:43.100 --> 10:45.933
LEVEL?

10:45.933 --> 10:48.300
 I THINK WHATEVER IT TAKES TO

10:45.933 --> 10:48.300
BUILD A FACILITY.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.033
 HAVE YOU LOOKED AT ANY?

10:48.300 --> 10:50.033
 YEAH.

10:50.033 --> 10:52.033
 WHAT'S THE OUTPUT?

10:50.033 --> 10:52.033
HOW MANY--WHAT'S THE PRODUCTION

10:52.033 --> 10:54.367
CAPACITY?

10:52.033 --> 10:54.367
 QUADRUPLE WHAT WE COULD GET--

10:54.367 --> 10:57.000
WHAT WE COULD BRING IN NOW.

10:54.367 --> 10:57.000
 FOR EVERY ONE YOU MAKE TODAY,

10:57.000 --> 10:58.433
IN A NEW FACILITY, YOU COULD

10:57.000 --> 10:58.433
MAKE FOUR?

10:58.433 --> 11:00.800
 CORRECT.

10:58.433 --> 11:00.800
 WHERE'S THE FACILITY AT?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.100
 THE BUILDING WE'RE LOOKING AT

11:02.900 --> 11:06.033
 CAN YOU TAKE ME TO SEE IT?

11:03.933 --> 11:06.033
 I COULD.

11:09.233 --> 11:12.800
 ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS IT.

11:09.233 --> 11:12.800
IT'S BEEN VACANT FOR 25 YEARS,

11:12.800 --> 11:16.900
AND THERE'S SO MUCH CRAP IN IT,

11:12.800 --> 11:16.900
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE, YOU KNOW--

11:16.900 --> 11:18.967
 DON'T BE TOO ENTHUSIASTIC.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.967
 YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, THE

11:18.967 --> 11:22.000
ROOF'S BEEN LEAKING, THE STUFF

11:18.967 --> 11:22.000
FELL, IT WAS FLOODED, IT'S--

11:22.000 --> 11:23.400
WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA

11:22.000 --> 11:23.400
FIND IN THERE, BUT--

11:23.400 --> 11:24.733
 AND THEN MORE AFTER THE

11:23.400 --> 11:24.733
STORM.

11:24.733 --> 11:26.267
 I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S

11:24.733 --> 11:26.267
BEAUTIFUL.

11:26.267 --> 11:28.233
I LOVE THE BUILDING, I LOVE THAT

11:26.267 --> 11:28.233
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

11:28.233 --> 11:30.367
 I KNOW MICHAEL DOESN'T WANT

11:28.233 --> 11:30.367
TO HEAR THIS, AND HE GETS CRAZY

11:30.367 --> 11:33.033
WHEN I TALK ABOUT IT.

11:30.367 --> 11:33.033
I THINK WHAT SCARES ME A LOT

11:33.033 --> 11:37.633
ABOUT IT IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF

11:33.033 --> 11:37.633
WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.700
THE BUILDING, THAT'S MONEY YOU

11:37.633 --> 11:39.700
GOTTA LAY OUT IMMEDIATELY.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.933
IF IT'S A $300,000 PRICE TAG TO

11:39.700 --> 11:43.933
BUY IT, THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH.

11:43.933 --> 11:36.200
YOU KNOW, YOU GET SO FAR IN, AND

11:43.933 --> 11:36.200
THEN THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU'RE

11:36.200 --> 11:47.167
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT--ALL RIGHT,

11:36.200 --> 11:47.167
GONNA HAVE WITH WHAT'S

11:47.167 --> 11:52.800
UNCOVERED, YOU KNOW, UM--

11:49.333 --> 11:52.800
 I WOULD GO RIGHT NOW, JUST

11:50.800 --> 11:52.800
GET GOING.

11:54.667 --> 11:59.333
 WHOA.

11:54.667 --> 11:59.333
 ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

11:59.333 --> 12:01.267
 YOU KNOW, LOOK, MICHAEL, THE

11:59.333 --> 12:01.267
MORE I LOOK AT THIS PLACE, THE

12:01.267 --> 12:04.000
MORE SCARED I GET.

12:01.267 --> 12:04.000
 STOP LOOKING AT IT.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.333
 THIS BUILDING IS A TOTAL

12:04.000 --> 12:07.333
DISASTER AFTER HURRICANE SANDY.

12:07.333 --> 12:10.400
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO REDO

12:07.333 --> 12:10.400
EVERYTHING--THE PLUMBING, THE

12:10.400 --> 12:14.667
ELECTRICAL, THE CEILING, THE

12:10.400 --> 12:14.667
FLOORS, THE WINDOWS, THE WALLS.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.900
IT'S A TOTAL MESS.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.900
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT RIGHT,

12:17.900 --> 12:19.567
THOUGH.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.567
 DO YOU WANT TO COME OVER

12:19.567 --> 12:21.900
HERE?

12:19.567 --> 12:21.900
 UH, NO.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.600
 I'LL PIGGYBACK YOU.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.600
 THAT'S OKAY.

12:24.600 --> 12:29.100
 WHAT A MESS.

12:24.600 --> 12:29.100
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A THEME

12:29.100 --> 12:32.100
THAT GOES ON WHERE YOU WANT TO

12:29.100 --> 12:32.100
GET STUFF DONE NOW, AND YOU WANT

12:32.100 --> 12:33.533
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.533
 CAUTIOUSLY.

12:33.533 --> 12:36.033
 RIGHT, RIGHT, EXACTLY.

12:33.533 --> 12:36.033
 THE BUILDING COSTS "X," THE

12:36.033 --> 12:39.167
BUILD OUT COSTS "Y," THOSE TWO

12:36.033 --> 12:39.167
ADD UP TO A NUMBER.

12:39.167 --> 12:40.733
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT TAKES TO

12:39.167 --> 12:40.733
GET IT ALL THE WAY TO OPEN?

12:40.733 --> 12:44.433
HOW MUCH MONEY?

12:40.733 --> 12:44.433
 $600,000 MARK.

12:44.433 --> 12:47.333
 REMEMBER, I'M RELYING ON YOUR

12:44.433 --> 12:47.333
NUMBERS FOR THE RETURN, SO...

12:47.333 --> 12:48.667
 IT'S ACCURATE.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.667
 IT'S LOW.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.267
 YEAH, I MEAN, THE, UH,

12:48.667 --> 12:51.267
MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT IS GONNA

12:51.267 --> 12:54.933
COST ABOUT $225,000.

12:51.267 --> 12:54.933
THE FREEZER, I'M EXPECTING ABOUT

12:54.933 --> 12:57.533
80,000.

12:54.933 --> 12:57.533
 AND HOW MUCH MARGIN DO YOU

12:57.533 --> 12:59.733
THINK YOU'RE GONNA PICK UP BY

12:57.533 --> 12:59.733
MAKING YOUR OWN STUFF?

12:59.733 --> 13:03.233
 AT LEAST 25%.

12:59.733 --> 13:03.233
 20% JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE

13:03.233 --> 13:05.267
SIDE.

13:03.233 --> 13:05.267
 SO IT TAKES A LITTLE LESS

13:05.267 --> 13:07.133
THAN TWO YEARS TO GET ALL YOUR

13:05.267 --> 13:07.133
MONEY BACK?

13:07.133 --> 13:08.733
 TO GET EVERYTHING BACK.

13:07.133 --> 13:08.733
EXACTLY RIGHT.

13:08.733 --> 13:12.100
 AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF IT

13:08.733 --> 13:12.100
TAKES, FROM YOUR MOUTH TO MY

13:12.100 --> 13:17.100
EARS, $600,000 TO GET IT RIGHT,

13:12.100 --> 13:17.100
AND THE RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT

13:17.100 --> 13:21.300
HAPPENS IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS,

13:17.100 --> 13:21.300
THEN I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO

13:21.300 --> 13:28.467
IS GET TO WORK ON GETTING IT.

13:21.300 --> 13:28.467
BUSINESSES ARE USUALLY ABOUT

13:28.467 --> 13:31.767
THREE THINGS FOR ME--PEOPLE,

13:28.467 --> 13:31.767
PROCESS, AND PRODUCT.

13:31.767 --> 13:35.267
I THINK THE PRODUCT'S EXCELLENT.

13:31.767 --> 13:35.267
I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE

13:35.267 --> 13:38.533
FANTASTIC, AND I THINK THE

13:35.267 --> 13:38.533
PROCESS IS BROKEN BECAUSE WE'RE

13:38.533 --> 13:40.967
GIVING UP MARGIN TO A THIRD

13:38.533 --> 13:40.967
PARTY WHEN WE CAN DO IT

13:40.967 --> 13:43.867
OURSELVES.

13:40.967 --> 13:43.867
THE BASIC PREMISE BEHIND THIS

13:43.867 --> 13:48.633
INVESTMENT FOR ME IS, CAN I

13:43.867 --> 13:48.633
DOUBLE OR TRIPLE MY MONEY?

13:48.633 --> 13:51.567
CAN I TRUST THE PEOPLE THAT I'M

13:48.633 --> 13:51.567
DOING BUSINESS WITH?

13:51.567 --> 13:53.867
YOU'RE NOW AT A POINT WHERE

13:51.567 --> 13:53.867
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO ANYWHERE

13:53.867 --> 13:56.533
UNLESS YOU DO SOMETHING

13:53.867 --> 13:56.533
DIFFERENT, AND I THINK THE

13:56.533 --> 14:00.200
BUSINESS NEEDS CAPITAL WITHOUT

13:56.533 --> 14:00.200
PRESSURE.

14:00.200 --> 14:03.033
WHAT THIS BUSINESS REALLY NEEDS

14:00.200 --> 14:03.033
IS AN INVESTOR WHO'S WILLING TO

14:03.033 --> 14:06.467
TAKE CHANCES AND IS WILLING TO

14:03.033 --> 14:06.467
PUT MONEY AT RISK FOR THE

14:06.467 --> 14:11.967
UPSIDE.

14:06.467 --> 14:11.967
SO MY OFFER IS $600,000 FOR 35%

14:11.967 --> 14:16.433
OF THE BUSINESS.

14:11.967 --> 14:16.433
 HMM.

14:16.433 --> 14:23.067
I, UH--I-I HAD OTHER IDEAS.

14:16.433 --> 14:23.067
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT ROYALTIES

14:23.067 --> 14:25.800
AND STUFF LIKE THAT INSTEAD OF,

14:23.067 --> 14:25.800
YOU KNOW, JUST A CLEAR

14:25.800 --> 14:31.367
PERCENTAGE.

14:25.800 --> 14:31.367
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M WILLING TO

14:31.367 --> 14:34.633
GIVE UP ANY OWNERSHIP OF THE

14:31.367 --> 14:34.633
BUSINESS.

14:34.633 --> 14:37.933
 THE REASON THAT I DON'T WANT

14:34.633 --> 14:37.933
TO BE A LENDER IS BECAUSE I WANT

14:37.933 --> 14:40.967
TO BE ON THE ELEVATOR.

14:37.933 --> 14:40.967
IF I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS

14:40.967 --> 14:43.500
SOMETHING GOOD, I WOULD BE A

14:40.967 --> 14:43.500
LENDER AT A HIGH RATE.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.533
 RIGHT.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.533
 BUT I THINK THERE'S

14:45.533 --> 14:48.467
SOMETHING HERE.

14:45.533 --> 14:48.467
I WANT TO INVEST MY MONEY IN

14:48.467 --> 14:51.500
MR. GREEN TEA FOR TWO SIMPLE

14:48.467 --> 14:51.500
REASONS--I KNOW IT'S SAFE,

14:51.500 --> 14:53.800
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL

14:51.500 --> 14:53.800
CONTROLS IN PLACE, AND THEY

14:53.800 --> 14:56.400
MANAGE THEIR MONEY PROBABLY

14:53.800 --> 14:56.400
BETTER THAN I'VE SEEN ANY

14:56.400 --> 15:00.567
BUSINESS SO FAR, AND I KNOW MY

14:56.400 --> 15:00.567
RETURN ON CAPITAL IS GONNA

15:00.567 --> 15:05.400
EXCEED MY EXPECTATIONS.

15:00.567 --> 15:05.400
I THINK MY OFFER IS VERY FAIR.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.067
I THINK MY OFFER IS WELL

15:05.400 --> 15:09.067
THOUGHT-OUT.

15:09.067 --> 15:11.767
I MEAN, WITHOUT ME, YOU'RE GONNA

15:09.067 --> 15:11.767
STAY A $2-MILLION COMPANY UNTIL

15:11.767 --> 15:14.900
HE'S 60.

15:11.767 --> 15:14.900
 THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD

15:14.900 --> 15:20.700
REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT.

15:14.900 --> 15:20.700
 THAT'S A REAL CHECK, BY THE

15:20.700 --> 15:23.767
WAY.

15:21.367 --> 15:23.767
 I--I SEE THAT.

15:22.033 --> 15:23.767
 [laughs]

15:28.700 --> 15:31.867
 I--[sighs]--I-I HAVE TO THINK

15:28.700 --> 15:31.867
ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT.

15:31.867 --> 15:33.833
 WELL, LET ME STEP OUT, SO YOU

15:31.867 --> 15:33.833
GUYS CAN TALK NOT IN FRONT OF

15:33.833 --> 15:36.967
ME, OKAY?

15:33.833 --> 15:36.967
 OKAY. OKAY.

15:36.967 --> 15:40.033
 ARE WE WILLING TO TAKE THIS

15:36.967 --> 15:40.033
RIGHT NOW?

15:40.033 --> 15:45.667
 I DIDN'T EXPECT MARCUS TO

15:40.033 --> 15:45.667
MAKE AN OFFER SO SOON.

15:45.667 --> 15:48.700
 THERE'S NO DOUBT TAKING THIS

15:45.667 --> 15:48.700
DEAL WILL EXCEL THE COMPANY.

15:48.700 --> 15:52.333
 IT'S A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE.

15:48.700 --> 15:52.333
 LEARNING DOESN'T COME FREE.

15:52.333 --> 15:55.067
 LISTEN, WITH THE LIFE THAT

15:52.333 --> 15:55.067
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S AROUND THE

15:55.067 --> 15:58.600
CORNER, I SAY GO FOR IT.

15:55.067 --> 15:58.600
 I DON'T THINK YOU--EITHER OF

15:58.600 --> 15:59.667
YOU CAN CONVINCE ME.

16:01.167 --> 16:05.467
 NO, I CAN'T, LORI.

16:02.467 --> 16:05.467
I DON'T THINK SO.

16:06.767 --> 16:08.400
 I THINK MY FATHER'S AT THE

16:06.767 --> 16:08.400
POINT WHERE HE'S COMFORTABLE.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.067
HE'S NOT HUNGRY ANYMORE, AND

16:08.400 --> 16:11.067
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE

16:11.067 --> 16:12.500
THAT ARE.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.500
I THINK WE CAN BRING IT TO THE

16:12.500 --> 16:13.967
NEXT LEVEL.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.967
I KNOW WE CAN BRING IT TO THE

16:13.967 --> 16:16.133
NEXT LEVEL.

16:13.967 --> 16:16.133
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THE

16:16.133 --> 16:19.167
COMPANY IS NOT NEARLY AT THE

16:16.133 --> 16:19.167
POTENTIAL IT CAN BE AT.

16:19.167 --> 16:22.467
WE NEED A FACILITY.

16:19.167 --> 16:22.467
WE NEED MORE FLAVORS AND MORE

16:22.467 --> 16:25.067
MARKETING MONEY.

16:22.467 --> 16:25.067
 UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, THIS

16:25.067 --> 16:27.600
IS MY COMPANY, SO YOU KNOW

16:25.067 --> 16:27.600
WHAT, TO THINK THAT--

16:27.600 --> 16:29.000
 IT'S UNFORTUNATELY FOR

16:27.600 --> 16:29.000
EVERYBODY HERE.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.533
 WELL, THIS IS NOT HOME.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.533
THIS IS THE OFFICE.

16:31.533 --> 16:35.100
 YOU ARE STRANGLING THE

16:31.533 --> 16:35.100
PROGRESSION OF THE BUSINESS.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.700
 BACK UP.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.700
YOU'RE CROSSING THE LINE BETWEEN

16:37.700 --> 16:44.433
FATHER AND BOSS.

16:39.100 --> 16:44.433
DO NOT COME IN HERE AGAIN AND

16:41.900 --> 16:44.433
SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY.

16:47.433 --> 16:50.733
THEY KNOW THE PRODUCT.

16:47.433 --> 16:50.733
 I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.

16:50.733 --> 16:53.300
QUICK CLOSE.

16:50.733 --> 16:53.300
SELL HIM.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.333
 1/4 MILLION IS OUT OF THE

16:54.433 --> 16:56.333
QUESTION.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.933
 WHAT?

17:00.367 --> 17:02.933
 YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S WORTH

17:02.933 --> 17:04.400
MORE THAN THAT, BUT IT'S NOT

17:02.933 --> 17:04.400
ABOUT THAT.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.833
 WELL, AS WE SAID, WE LOOKED

17:04.400 --> 17:05.833
AT THE UPSIDE.

17:05.833 --> 17:06.633
 IT'S NOT ABOUT IT.

17:08.333 --> 17:11.733
TAKING THE DEAL, AND LIKE I

17:09.333 --> 17:11.733
SAID, THAT'S--

17:14.967 --> 17:19.133
 YOU KNOW, MARCUS, I DIDN'T--

17:14.967 --> 17:19.133
I DIDN'T EXPECT, UM--

17:19.133 --> 17:21.032
 ACTUALLY, WE DIDN'T EXPECT

17:19.133 --> 17:21.032
THIS TO HAPPEN TODAY...

17:21.032 --> 17:22.467
 SO QUICKLY.

17:21.032 --> 17:22.467
 'CAUSE WE THOUGHT THERE WAS

17:22.467 --> 17:24.233
GONNA BE DAYS, DAYS, DAYS.

17:22.467 --> 17:24.233
 WHY DON'T WE GO THROUGH A

17:24.233 --> 17:26.300
NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY

17:24.233 --> 17:26.300
HAVE?

17:26.300 --> 17:27.933
 OKAY.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.933
 SO MY DAD TAKES THIS CHECK...

17:27.933 --> 17:30.967
 MM-HMM.

17:27.933 --> 17:30.967
 AND YOU RECEIVE 35% OF THE

17:30.967 --> 17:32.300
COMPANY.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.300
 MM-HMM.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.600
 YOU KNOW, THE DAY-TO-DAY

17:32.300 --> 17:34.600
OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS ARE

17:34.600 --> 17:37.167
GONNA STAY RIGHT HERE...

17:34.600 --> 17:37.167
 I DON'T CARE.

17:37.167 --> 17:39.233
 IN THIS OFFICE.

17:37.167 --> 17:39.233
YOU DON'T WANT ANY PART OF THAT?

17:39.233 --> 17:41.367
 I DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.367
IF YOU NEED MY ADVICE OR YOU

17:41.367 --> 17:46.167
NEED SOME INPUT, YOU'LL CALL ME.

17:41.367 --> 17:46.167
 AND THIS IS--THIS IS NOT A

17:46.167 --> 17:45.233
I CAN'T THINK ABOUT THIS AT ALL?

17:46.167 --> 17:45.233
THIS IS A--

17:45.233 --> 17:52.933
"SLEEP ON IT" DEAL?

17:49.067 --> 17:52.933
 YOU CAN, BUT THE DEAL WILL

17:50.500 --> 17:52.933
GET WORSE.

17:54.233 --> 17:59.267
YOU WILL NEVER CHANGE THIS

17:54.233 --> 17:59.267
BUSINESS MODEL, EVER, WITHOUT

17:59.267 --> 18:02.667
ME.

17:59.267 --> 18:02.667
 [sighs]

18:02.667 --> 18:06.367
UM...

18:02.667 --> 18:06.367
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S VERY LUCRATIVE.

18:06.367 --> 18:09.667
IT'S LUCRATIVE ON BOTH ENDS.

18:10.733 --> 18:13.967
I'M CONCERNED.

18:12.033 --> 18:13.967
 SO DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

18:20.533 --> 18:25.600
 WE HAVE A DEAL.

18:20.533 --> 18:25.600
I FEEL--I FEEL BETTER.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.467
 OKAY, SO THERE'S A CATCH.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.467
 OKAY.

18:29.467 --> 18:32.967
 SIT DOWN.

18:29.467 --> 18:32.967
THE CATCH IS, WHEN YOU TAKE MY

18:32.967 --> 18:38.833
MONEY, FOR THE NEXT WEEK, I'M IN

18:32.967 --> 18:38.833
CHARGE.

18:38.833 --> 18:42.800
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

18:38.833 --> 18:42.800
 OKAY.

18:42.800 --> 18:47.067
 AND IT'S GONNA BE A VERY LONG

18:42.800 --> 18:47.067
WEEK.

18:47.067 --> 18:50.400
WE'RE HERE TOMORROW EARLY.

18:47.067 --> 18:50.400
RISE AND SHINE TO WORK.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.500
I WOULD LIKE IF YOU DRESSED LIKE

18:50.400 --> 18:53.500
I'M GONNA DRESS TOMORROW, WHICH

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
IS IN A TIE AND A SHIRT.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.500
 YES, I WILL.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.833
 BE A LITTLE MORE

18:55.500 --> 18:56.833
PROFESSIONAL.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.200
 OKAY.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.200
 YOU DRESS HOWEVER YOU WANT

18:58.200 --> 18:59.533
SINCE YOU OWN THE JOINT.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.533
 OKAY.

18:59.533 --> 19:06.467
 AND WE'RE GONNA GO TO WORK.

18:59.533 --> 19:06.467
 NIGHT.

19:06.467 --> 19:07.133
 [sighs]

19:08.567 --> 19:14.733
HERE, AND THEY'RE NEVER EASY.

19:12.533 --> 19:14.733
THEY'RE NEVER, NEVER EASY.

19:17.467 --> 19:20.367
 WHEN I GO IN TO LOOK AT

19:17.467 --> 19:20.367
BUSINESS, I LOOK AT PEOPLE,

19:20.367 --> 19:23.400
PROCESS, AND PRODUCT.

19:20.367 --> 19:23.400
I LOVE THE PRODUCT.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.700
IT'S SPECTACULAR, BUT I AM

19:23.400 --> 19:26.700
WORRIED THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

19:26.700 --> 19:29.133
VARIATIONS OF PRODUCT.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.133
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE PIGEONHOLED

19:29.133 --> 19:31.833
INTO ONE THING.

19:29.133 --> 19:31.833
I THINK THE MOST EXCITING THING

19:31.833 --> 19:33.533
IS GONNA BE DEVELOPING SOME NEW

19:31.833 --> 19:33.533
FLAVORS.

19:33.533 --> 19:36.367
CURRENTLY, MR. GREEN TEA HAS A

19:33.533 --> 19:36.367
LIMITED NUMBERS OF FLAVORS, AND

19:36.367 --> 19:39.467
THEY'RE FOCUSING SOLELY ON THE

19:36.367 --> 19:39.467
ASIAN RESTAURANT MARKET.

19:39.467 --> 19:43.233
I WANT TO EXPAND NEW FLAVORS AND

19:39.467 --> 19:43.233
NEW LOCATIONS, INCLUDING RETAIL

19:43.233 --> 19:45.867
STORES, SO THAT WE CAN BECOME A

19:43.233 --> 19:45.867
HOUSEHOLD BRAND LIKE

19:45.867 --> 19:48.733
HAAGEN-DAZS.

19:45.867 --> 19:48.733
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROCESS,

19:48.733 --> 19:52.100
TODAY, OUR RELATIONSHIP IS WITH

19:48.733 --> 19:52.100
CO-PACKERS, AND THOSE CO-PACKERS

19:52.100 --> 19:56.733
HAVE US AT THEIR MERCY.

19:52.100 --> 19:56.733
THEY CONTROL THE SUPPLY.

19:56.733 --> 20:01.333
WANT TO EXPLORE ALTERNATIVES TO

19:56.733 --> 20:01.333
BEING RELIANT ON CO-PACKERS.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.733
WE'RE GONNA OPEN OUR OWN

20:01.333 --> 20:03.733
MANUFACTURING PLANT, WHICH WILL

20:03.733 --> 20:07.133
PUT US IN CHARGE OF PRODUCTION.

20:03.733 --> 20:07.133
WE WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO CHEAPLY

20:07.133 --> 20:10.733
CREATE AND TEST NEW PRODUCTS AND

20:07.133 --> 20:10.733
NEW FLAVORS.

20:10.733 --> 20:13.533
ALL THESE CHANGES WILL GIVE US

20:10.733 --> 20:13.533
THE ABILITY TO GO FROM $2 1/2

20:13.533 --> 20:16.567
MILLION TO $5 MILLION WITHIN 12

20:13.533 --> 20:16.567
MONTHS.

20:16.567 --> 20:17.767
I'M EXPECTING TO GO TO

20:16.567 --> 20:17.767
THEY CONTROL THE PRICING, SO I

20:17.767 --> 20:20.833
$30 MILLION IN THE NEXT FOUR TO

20:17.767 --> 20:20.833
FIVE YEARS.

20:20.833 --> 20:23.233
THE LAST ONE IS PEOPLE.

20:20.833 --> 20:23.233
I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE A

20:23.233 --> 20:26.767
WONDERFUL FAMILY, BUT THE

20:23.233 --> 20:26.767
DYNAMIC BETWEEN FATHER AND SON

20:26.767 --> 20:29.300
IS ALWAYS A TOUGH CHALLENGE IN

20:26.767 --> 20:29.300
BUSINESS.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.900
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.900
RICH HAS TO LEARN HOW TO TAKE

20:31.900 --> 20:34.600
SOME CHANCES.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.600
I LIKE CASH IN THE BANK LIKE YOU

20:34.600 --> 20:39.300
DO, AND I DON'T LIKE DEBT, BUT I

20:34.600 --> 20:39.300
ALSO LIKE GROWTH.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.633
YOU KNOW WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT

20:39.300 --> 20:41.633
MICHAEL IS THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW

20:41.633 --> 20:45.933
HIS NUMBERS THE WAY HE SHOULD.

20:41.633 --> 20:45.933
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO TO WORK.

20:45.933 --> 20:49.633
I'D LIKE TO GO MAYBE MAKE SOME

20:47.000 --> 20:49.633
ICE CREAM, DO THAT.

20:47.667 --> 20:49.633
 LET'S DO IT.

20:53.133 --> 20:55.933
 SO EDUCATE ME ON SOMETHING.

20:53.133 --> 20:55.933
ONCE THE INGREDIENTS ARE

20:55.933 --> 20:57.533
ESTABLISHED...

20:55.933 --> 20:57.533
 YES.

20:57.533 --> 21:00.867
 THEY CAN BE MODIFIED INTO

20:57.533 --> 21:00.867
FROZEN YOGURT?

21:00.867 --> 21:03.133
THEY CAN BE MODIFIED INTO SOFT

21:00.867 --> 21:03.133
SERVE?

21:03.133 --> 21:04.467
 CORRECT.

21:03.133 --> 21:04.467
 IT'S ALL THE BASE.

21:04.467 --> 21:06.400
 IT'S IMPORTANT FOR MR. GREEN

21:04.467 --> 21:06.400
TEA TO EXPAND THEIR FLAVORS AND

21:06.400 --> 21:08.667
PRODUCTS, BECAUSE ONCE PEOPLE

21:06.400 --> 21:08.667
FALL IN LOVE WITH THE BRAND, WE

21:08.667 --> 21:10.733
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A

21:08.667 --> 21:10.733
FLAVOR FOR EVERYBODY.

21:10.733 --> 21:12.367
THERE'S TWO WAYS YOU CAN GROW

21:10.733 --> 21:12.367
THIS BUSINESS.

21:12.367 --> 21:15.567
YOU CAN GROW IT VERTICALLY, UP

21:12.367 --> 21:15.567
AND DOWN, BY DEVELOPING NEW

21:15.567 --> 21:19.333
FLAVORS, OR YOU CAN GROW IT

21:15.567 --> 21:19.333
HORIZONTALLY, BY CREATING NEW

21:19.333 --> 21:22.433
BRANDS AND NEW IDEAS.

21:19.333 --> 21:22.433
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HIT

21:22.433 --> 21:26.233
ALL PARTS OF THE MARKET FROM A

21:22.433 --> 21:26.233
5-YEAR-OLD TO A 50-YEAR-OLD.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.933
WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE

21:26.233 --> 21:28.933
BUSINESS TODAY IS, I DON'T LIKE

21:28.933 --> 21:32.133
THAT THE WHOLE BUSINESS

21:28.933 --> 21:32.133
FOUNDATION IS BASED ON ONE NAME.

21:32.133 --> 21:36.667
 I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WE

21:32.133 --> 21:36.667
COULD DO ANOTHER BRAND, ANOTHER

21:36.667 --> 21:38.133
SPIN-OFF.

21:36.667 --> 21:38.133
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD DO A

21:38.133 --> 21:41.600
GELATO COMPANY 'CAUSE WE ARE

21:38.133 --> 21:41.600
ITALIAN, AND WE, YOU KNOW, DEAL

21:41.600 --> 21:43.300
PRIMARILY IN ASIAN FLAVORS.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.300
IT'D BE NICE TO TAKE OUR

21:43.300 --> 21:47.333
HERITAGE INTO MAKING SOME OF THE

21:43.300 --> 21:47.333
PRODUCTS THAT WE MAKE MONEY ON,

21:47.333 --> 21:50.333
SO I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF

21:47.333 --> 21:50.333
SOLO GELATO, 'CAUSE THE WORD

21:50.333 --> 21:52.800
"SOLO" MEANS THE SAME THING IN

21:50.333 --> 21:52.800
ITALIAN AS IT DOES IN ENGLISH.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.100
 I LOVE IT.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.100
 IT'S A SINGULAR FLAVOR.

21:55.100 --> 21:56.867
SOLO.

21:55.100 --> 21:56.867
ONE.

21:56.867 --> 21:59.367
SO THE TAGLINE COULD BE

21:56.867 --> 21:59.367
SOMETHING LIKE, "SOMETIMES ALL

21:59.367 --> 22:02.867
YOU NEED IS ONE BOLD FLAVOR."

21:59.367 --> 22:02.867
 I LOVE THE IDEA.

22:02.867 --> 22:06.100
 IT IS A GOOD IDEA.

22:02.867 --> 22:06.100
 BUT?

22:06.100 --> 22:08.333
 THERE'S ALWAYS A BUT, BUT--

22:06.100 --> 22:08.333
 BUT LAUNCHING A WHOLE NEW

22:08.333 --> 22:09.733
BRAND--

22:08.333 --> 22:09.733
 I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT

22:09.733 --> 22:11.833
LAUNCHING A WHOLE NEW LINE.

22:09.733 --> 22:11.833
 IT WOULD BE--IT'S GONNA BE--

22:11.833 --> 22:14.700
 IT'S GONNA BE EXPENSIVE.

22:11.833 --> 22:14.700
 I THINK MICHAEL'S IDEA TO

22:14.700 --> 22:17.533
CREATE A GELATO LINE WAS

22:14.700 --> 22:17.533
BRILLIANT BECAUSE HE UNDERSTANDS

22:17.533 --> 22:19.900
THAT TAKING A FACILITY THAT

22:17.533 --> 22:19.900
WE'RE ALREADY GONNA BE OPERATING

22:19.900 --> 22:23.233
MAKING ICE CREAM AND CREATING

22:19.900 --> 22:23.233
ANOTHER PRODUCT INSIDE THAT SAME

22:23.233 --> 22:26.167
FACILITY, GETTING THE EFFICIENCY

22:23.233 --> 22:26.167
OUT OF IT, I MEAN, HONESTLY, I'M

22:26.167 --> 22:28.867
VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIM.

22:26.167 --> 22:28.867
SO YOU NEED TO START TO THINK

22:28.867 --> 22:33.567
ABOUT AN UMBRELLA BRAND AND

22:28.867 --> 22:33.567
REALLY CREATING SOMETHING THAT

22:33.567 --> 22:36.000
THESE DIFFERENT FLAVORS CAN SIT

22:33.567 --> 22:36.000
INSIDE OF.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.633
CREATING A GELATO LINE CALLED

22:36.000 --> 22:39.633
"SOLO" SHOULD NOT SIT UNDER A

22:39.633 --> 22:42.933
NAME BRAND "GREEN TEA."

22:39.633 --> 22:42.933
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, AND I HAVE

22:42.933 --> 22:46.100
TO BE VERY HONEST ABOUT IT, IS

22:42.933 --> 22:46.100
THAT IN ORDER FOR THIS BUSINESS

22:46.100 --> 22:49.200
TO GROW, IT WILL NEVER FUNCTION

22:46.100 --> 22:49.200
WELL UNDER THE GREEN TEA NAME.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.567
 THEY KNOW THE NAME.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.567
THEY LOVE IT.

22:50.567 --> 22:53.533
 NOBODY'S GOING TO BUY BLOOD

22:50.567 --> 22:53.533
ORANGE GELATO...

22:53.533 --> 22:57.667
 MR. GREEN TEA ICE CREAM.

22:53.533 --> 22:57.667
 FROM MR. GREEN TEA.

22:57.667 --> 23:01.967
THE ACTUAL GREEN TEA FLAVORED

22:57.667 --> 23:01.967
ICE CREAM, WHICH IS WHAT THE

23:01.967 --> 23:05.467
BULK OF THE BUSINESS IS, I WOULD

23:01.967 --> 23:05.467
NEVER ADVOCATE CHANGING THE NAME

23:05.467 --> 23:07.767
OF THAT, EVER.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.767
THIS PACKAGE WILL NEVER CHANGE.

23:07.767 --> 23:10.067
MR. GREEN TEA WOULD BE THE

23:07.767 --> 23:10.067
FLAVOR.

23:10.067 --> 23:11.467
 THEN WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THE

23:10.067 --> 23:11.467
BRAND?

23:11.467 --> 23:13.567
 YOU KNOW, IF I JUST WAS KIND

23:11.467 --> 23:13.567
OF BRAINSTORMING AND COMING OFF

23:13.567 --> 23:16.233
THE TOP OF MY HEAD, YOU KNOW,

23:13.567 --> 23:16.233
WHY WOULDN'T YOU CALL IT

23:16.233 --> 23:20.700
KEYPORT CREAMERY?

23:16.233 --> 23:20.700
THE KEYPORT CREAMERY IS AN

23:20.700 --> 23:24.633
EMANUELE FAMILY COMPANY, RIGHT?

23:20.700 --> 23:24.633
VERY NICE UNDERNEATH, AND WE

WRAPPED UP QUICKLY, AT 200,000.

24:34.967 --> 24:37.567
 NO WAY.

24:37.567 --> 24:38.900
I COULD--

24:37.567 --> 24:38.900
 [sighs]

24:38.900 --> 24:40.367
 I COULD POTENTIALLY DO

24:38.900 --> 24:40.367
250,000.

24:40.367 --> 24:42.300
 1/4 MILLION IS OUT OF THE

24:40.367 --> 24:42.300
QUESTION.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.800
THAT'S CRAZY.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.800
 I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND

24:43.800 --> 24:47.367
THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT THIS

24:43.800 --> 24:47.367
PLACE HAS TO GO THROUGH BEFORE

24:47.367 --> 24:49.733
IT'S EVEN HABITABLE.

24:47.367 --> 24:49.733
 I DON'T HEAR YOU TELLING HIM

24:49.733 --> 24:54.000
THE REASONS WHY, IN CASH, AND

24:49.733 --> 24:54.000
THE REASONS WHY.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.433
QUICK CLOSE.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.433
SELL HIM.

24:56.433 --> 24:59.700
MICHAEL'S STRUGGLING DURING THE

24:56.433 --> 24:59.700
NEGOTIATION, BUT WHAT I DO LIKE

24:59.700 --> 25:02.200
IS THAT HE CONVINCES HIMSELF

24:59.700 --> 25:02.200
THAT HE HAS THE KNOWLEDGE AND

25:02.200 --> 25:04.967
THE ENERGY, BUT HE JUST DOESN'T

25:02.200 --> 25:04.967
HAVE THE EXPERIENCE.

25:04.967 --> 25:06.767
 LISTEN, WE'RE DOING NO

25:04.967 --> 25:06.767
FINANCING.

25:06.767 --> 25:08.567
CASH DEAL.

25:06.767 --> 25:08.567
QUICK.

25:08.567 --> 25:10.433
GET IT DONE WITH.

25:08.567 --> 25:10.433
 LISTEN, I APPRECIATE WHAT

25:10.433 --> 25:12.633
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

25:10.433 --> 25:12.633
I'M JUST TELLING YOU, I CAN'T

25:12.633 --> 25:15.300
AGREE TO THAT.

25:12.633 --> 25:15.300
I CAN AGREE TO 240,000.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.967
I CANNOT AGREE ON ANYTHING LESS.

25:15.300 --> 25:17.967
 WE'LL DO 230,000, AND WE'LL

25:17.967 --> 25:19.800
WRAP IT UP TODAY.

25:17.967 --> 25:19.800
 I CAN'T.

25:19.800 --> 25:24.100
I CAN'T.

25:19.800 --> 25:24.100
DEAL IF YOU PAY THE TAXES.

25:24.100 --> 25:27.600
 NO, I JUST TOLD YOU, I CAN'T.

25:24.100 --> 25:27.600
 ALL RIGHT.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.933
 both: 15,000.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.933
 OKAY, WE'LL TAKE THE 240,000

25:28.933 --> 25:30.533
 YEAH.

25:28.933 --> 25:30.533
 SO YOU'RE PAYING 255,000.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.333
 WE'RE PAYING 255,000 ON IT,

25:30.533 --> 25:32.333
YEAH.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.433
LET'S SPLIT THE TAXES AT

25:32.333 --> 25:34.433
240,000, THEN.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.667
 I CANNOT.

25:37.100 --> 25:40.867
240,000?

25:38.333 --> 25:40.867
 I CAN'T.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.333
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25:44.200 --> 25:46.333
 I COULD HAVE SPENT THAT

25:46.333 --> 25:48.833
18,000 FIVE OTHER WAYS.

25:49.733 --> 25:51.633
TO MY MIND IS "RECKLESS."

25:57.900 --> 25:56.833
240,000, THEN.

25:57.900 --> 25:56.833
 I CANNOT.

25:56.833 --> 26:01.600
 LET'S SPLIT THE TAXES AT

25:56.833 --> 26:01.600
 YOU WILL NOT GO A PENNY BELOW

26:01.600 --> 26:06.800
240,000?

26:01.600 --> 26:06.800
 I CAN'T.

26:06.800 --> 26:10.167
I CAN LOOK AT WHAT I WOULD SELL

26:06.800 --> 26:10.167
IT FOR AND TAKE OUT EXPENSES

26:10.167 --> 26:13.233
THAT I HAD FACTORED IN, AND I

26:10.167 --> 26:13.233
GET THE NET NUMBER.

26:13.233 --> 26:15.600
 HI, NIKO, THIS IS MARCUS.

26:13.233 --> 26:15.600
I'M A NEW INVESTOR IN

26:15.600 --> 26:17.167
MR. GREEN TEA.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.167
 HEY, MARCUS.

26:17.167 --> 26:18.533
 ARE YOU GREEK?

26:17.167 --> 26:18.533
 YES.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.100
 SO AM I, LEMONIS.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.100
SO...

26:20.100 --> 26:21.433
 OH.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.433
 IT'S TWO GREEK--

26:21.433 --> 26:23.033
 SO, SEE, YOU KNOW HOW THE

26:21.433 --> 26:23.033
GREEKS ARE, THEN.

26:23.033 --> 26:24.633
 THAT'S RIGHT.

26:23.033 --> 26:24.633
I DO KNOW HOW THE GREEKS ARE.

26:24.633 --> 26:29.567
LISTEN, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

26:24.633 --> 26:29.567
FOR US JUST TO BUY THE BANK'S

26:29.567 --> 26:32.500
POSITION.

26:29.567 --> 26:32.500
SO IF WE JUST SIGNED A DEAL TO

26:32.500 --> 26:37.867
BUY THE BANK'S POSITION AT

26:32.500 --> 26:37.867
$240,000, THE ECONOMICS ARE THE

26:37.867 --> 26:41.300
SAME FOR YOU, BUT THEY PUT US IN

26:37.867 --> 26:41.300
A LITTLE BETTER SPOT, AND I WANT

26:41.300 --> 26:44.400
THE LEVERAGE TO HAVE THE ABILITY

26:41.300 --> 26:44.400
TO GET SOMETHING BACK.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.267
WHEN THE ORIGINAL BORROWER TOOK

26:44.400 --> 26:47.267
OUT A LOAN AGAINST THE

26:47.267 --> 26:25.933
WAREHOUSE, HE PLEDGED ADDITIONAL

26:47.267 --> 26:25.933
PIECES OF PROPERTY OTHER THAN

26:25.933 --> 26:52.300
THINK MAY BE A BETTER ANGLE IS

26:25.933 --> 26:52.300
THE WAREHOUSE AS PART OF THE

26:52.300 --> 26:54.467
LOAN.

26:52.300 --> 26:54.467
THE LOAN IS NOW IN DEFAULT, AND

26:54.467 --> 26:58.067
THE BANK IS FORECLOSING, SO WHEN

26:54.467 --> 26:58.067
I BUY THE BANK NOTE, I'M NOT

26:58.067 --> 27:00.967
ONLY GONNA GET THE WAREHOUSE AS

26:58.067 --> 27:00.967
COLLATERAL, BUT I'M GOING TO GET

27:00.967 --> 27:03.833
OTHER PIECES OF PROPERTY AS

27:00.967 --> 27:03.833
COLLATERAL AS WELL.

27:03.833 --> 27:07.533
MY PLAN IS TO LIQUIDATE THOSE

27:03.833 --> 27:07.533
OTHER PIECES OF PROPERTY, WHICH

27:07.533 --> 27:13.100
WILL LOWER MY INVESTMENT FROM

27:07.533 --> 27:13.100
$240,000 TO $140,000.

27:13.100 --> 27:14.667
 YOU ARE 100% CORRECT.

27:13.100 --> 27:14.667
 DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

27:14.667 --> 27:16.333
 YOU SHOULD. YOU SHOULD!

27:14.667 --> 27:16.333
 TO ME, THE NET RESULT IS THE

27:16.333 --> 27:17.667
SAME.

27:16.333 --> 27:17.667
 YEAH.

27:17.667 --> 27:20.367
 TO ME A NOTE SALE IS ACTUALLY

27:17.667 --> 27:20.367
AN EASIER DEAL, AND I HAVE NO

27:20.367 --> 27:22.433
PROBLEM WITH THAT.

27:20.367 --> 27:22.433
IF YOU COULD DO 240,000 FOR THE

27:22.433 --> 27:25.533
NOTE, I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT

27:22.433 --> 27:25.533
NUMBER WORKS.

27:25.533 --> 27:29.733
 UNDER THESE TERMS, ARE YOU

27:25.533 --> 27:29.733
COMFORTABLE MOVING FORWARD?

27:29.733 --> 27:32.567
 YEAH.

27:29.733 --> 27:32.567
 OKAY, SO WE HAVE A DEAL THEN?

27:32.567 --> 27:34.600
 YEAH, 240,000 WILL BE THE

27:32.567 --> 27:34.600
PURCHASE PRICE.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.500
 LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.500
THIS IS MORE OF A TRIVIA

27:36.500 --> 27:39.267
QUESTION.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.267
WHAT WOULD YOU GUESS THAT WE DO

27:39.267 --> 27:41.800
AS A COMPANY?

27:39.267 --> 27:41.800
 MR. GREEN TEA?

27:41.800 --> 27:45.533
 YES.

27:41.800 --> 27:45.533
 UH, MAKE TEA LEAVES?

27:45.533 --> 27:46.867
 OKAY.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.867
 [laughs]

27:46.867 --> 27:48.200
 THANKS, BUDDY.

27:46.867 --> 27:48.200
I APPRECIATE IT.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.667
EFHARISTO.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.667
 WHAT--WHAT DO YOU DO?

27:50.667 --> 27:53.500
 WE MAKE ICE CREAM.

27:50.667 --> 27:53.500
 OH, REALLY?

27:53.500 --> 27:57.133
 YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

27:53.500 --> 27:57.133
[laughter]

27:57.133 --> 27:59.800
 YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT

27:57.133 --> 27:59.800
YOUR REBRANDING.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.633
[laughter]

27:59.800 --> 28:01.633
 OH, GOOD.

28:01.633 --> 28:03.000
GOOD POINT.

28:01.633 --> 28:03.000
THANK YOU.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.467
I MAY--I WOULD HAVE PAID YOU

28:04.500 --> 28:07.467
245,000 FOR THAT.

28:05.300 --> 28:07.467
[laughter]

28:16.067 --> 28:18.333
HOLY MOLY.

28:16.067 --> 28:18.333
LOOK AT YOU.

28:18.333 --> 28:20.133
 [chuckles] WHAT'S UP?

28:18.333 --> 28:20.133
 LOOKING SHARP.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.067
 THANK YOU.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.067
 WHILE THE WAREHOUSE PAPERS

28:22.067 --> 28:24.500
ARE BEING DRAWN UP, I'VE ASKED

28:22.067 --> 28:24.500
THE GRAPHIC DESIGNERS TO PUT

28:24.500 --> 28:27.700
TOGETHER SOME NEW LOOKS AND

28:24.500 --> 28:27.700
LOGOS FOR NOT ONLY THE COMPANY,

28:27.700 --> 28:32.833
BUT THE SOLO GELATO LINE.

28:27.700 --> 28:32.833
SO THIS WOULD BE A SORT OF, KIND

28:32.833 --> 28:36.533
OF A PRINT CAMPAIGN FOR WHATEVER

28:32.833 --> 28:36.533
FLAVOR WE WANTED IT TO BE.

28:36.533 --> 28:38.667
 I LOVE THAT.

28:36.533 --> 28:38.667
THAT'S AWESOME.

28:38.667 --> 28:42.267
 THIS IS CRACK ONE AT SOLO.

28:38.667 --> 28:42.267
THERE'S ANOTHER LOOK HERE.

28:42.267 --> 28:44.533
 LOVE THAT ONE.

28:42.267 --> 28:44.533
 I LIKE THAT ONE AS WELL.

28:44.533 --> 28:46.400
VERY EUROPEAN.

28:44.533 --> 28:46.400
 I AGREE.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.933
 I LIKE 'EM.

28:46.400 --> 28:48.933
I-I REALLY DO.

28:48.933 --> 28:52.300
THIS ONE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

28:48.933 --> 28:52.300
LISTEN, WOMEN SELL PRODUCTS VERY

28:52.300 --> 28:54.633
EASILY.

28:52.300 --> 28:54.633
THIS MAKES YOU TURN.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.167
 WELL, SEX SELLS, SO I MEAN...

28:54.633 --> 28:57.167
 YEAH, BUT IT'S JUST, YOU

28:57.167 --> 29:00.467
KNOW.

28:57.167 --> 29:00.467
 I WAS SURPRISED HOW MUCH RICH

29:00.467 --> 29:03.200
LIKED IT, AND IT WAS INTERESTING

29:00.467 --> 29:03.200
TO STAND BACK AND WATCH LORI

29:03.200 --> 29:06.300
AND MICHAEL AND RICH KIND OF

29:03.200 --> 29:06.300
DEBATE ON STYLES AND COLORS.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.567
I WANT THEM TO PICK SOMETHING

29:06.300 --> 29:08.567
THAT THEY LOVE.

29:08.567 --> 29:11.767
IS THIS WHOLE THING A LITTLE

29:08.567 --> 29:11.767
SURREAL FOR YOU?

29:11.767 --> 29:13.733
YOU'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO FOR A

29:11.767 --> 29:13.733
LONG TIME.

29:13.733 --> 29:10.600
 IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN MICHAEL

29:13.733 --> 29:10.600
AND I, LIKE--

29:10.600 --> 29:17.333
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE THINGS

29:10.600 --> 29:17.333
 WEEKS.

29:17.333 --> 29:20.000
 AND COULD WE EVEN DO IT?

29:17.333 --> 29:20.000
 SO BASED ON RICH'S PACE, WE

29:20.000 --> 29:21.500
COULD PROBABLY HAVE THIS DONE BY

29:20.000 --> 29:21.500
2035.

29:21.500 --> 29:24.100
[laughter]

29:21.500 --> 29:24.100
 TWO THOUSAND--AT LEAST.

29:24.100 --> 29:25.700
 I WOULD GET IT FASTER.

29:24.100 --> 29:25.700
 I SAID, RICH, "YOU'RE GONNA

29:25.700 --> 29:27.167
HAVE TO LEARN TO MOVE A LITTLE

29:29.300 --> 29:31.933
 ALL RIGHT, GUYS, THANK YOU.

29:30.033 --> 29:31.933
 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.867
 MICHAEL CALLED AND TOLD US TO

29:36.500 --> 29:38.867
MEET HIM OUTSIDE THE OFFICE.

29:38.867 --> 29:46.467
HE HAS A SURPRISE FOR US.

29:38.867 --> 29:46.467
[horn honks]

29:46.467 --> 29:48.800
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:46.467 --> 29:48.800
 WHAT IS IT?

29:48.800 --> 29:51.933
 IT'S A FIAT 500.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.933
 WELL, I KNOW IT'S A CAR.

29:51.933 --> 29:54.133
I KNOW WHAT KIND OF CAR IT IS.

29:51.933 --> 29:54.133
WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT HERE?

29:54.133 --> 29:56.267
WHAT IS THIS?

29:54.133 --> 29:56.267
 IT'S A MOBILE PROMOTIONAL

29:56.267 --> 29:58.733
VEHICLE.

29:56.267 --> 29:58.733
IT'S A WAY TO TEST THE RETAIL

29:58.733 --> 30:01.800
THEORY AND SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE

29:58.733 --> 30:01.800
ACTUALLY WANT TO BUY MOCHI ICE

30:01.800 --> 30:04.633
CREAM AND MR. GREEN TEA PRODUCTS

30:01.800 --> 30:04.633
IN NEW YORK.

30:04.633 --> 30:08.133
REALLY LOW OPERATING COST.

30:04.633 --> 30:08.133
WE CAN GET ABOUT BETWEEN 650 AND

30:08.133 --> 30:13.833
700 MOCHI IN THIS FREEZER.

30:08.133 --> 30:13.833
OUT THE DOOR CAR, GRAPHICS, AND

30:13.833 --> 30:19.900
THE FREEZER WAS 18,500.

30:13.833 --> 30:19.900
 $18,000?

30:19.900 --> 30:23.333
HOW MANY MOCHI DO WE HAVE TO

30:19.900 --> 30:23.333
SELL TO PAY FOR THIS?

30:23.333 --> 30:27.200
 UH, I DO HAVE NUMBERS.

30:23.333 --> 30:27.200
I DO HAVE NUMBERS.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.533
 OKAY.

30:27.200 --> 30:28.533
 THEY'RE IN MY HEAD.

30:28.533 --> 30:31.067
 [laughs] THAT DOESN'T--

30:28.533 --> 30:31.067
I WAS REALLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD

30:31.067 --> 30:33.200
WHEN MICHAEL WENT OUT AND MADE

30:31.067 --> 30:33.200
THIS EXTRAVAGANT PURCHASE

30:33.200 --> 30:36.033
WITHOUT ANYBODY'S PERMISSION.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.033
IT'S A BOLD MOVE, BUT IT'S

30:36.033 --> 30:38.867
IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE IF IT'S

30:36.033 --> 30:38.867
A GOOD RETURN UNLESS YOU RUN THE

30:38.867 --> 30:41.300
NUMBERS.

30:38.867 --> 30:41.300
 YOU KNOW, YOU JUST CAN'T KEEP

30:41.300 --> 30:44.167
ALL THESE NUMBERS IN YOUR HEAD

30:41.300 --> 30:44.167
AND THINK THAT EVERYONE COULD

30:44.167 --> 30:45.867
READ WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

30:44.167 --> 30:45.867
 WHY CAN'T YOU TRUST THAT I

30:45.867 --> 30:47.833
KNOW WHAT I'M DOING?

30:45.867 --> 30:47.833
 BECAUSE I COULD HAVE SPENT

30:47.833 --> 30:54.000
THAT 18,000 FIVE OTHER WAYS.

30:50.467 --> 30:54.000
 MICHAEL, THE WORD THAT COMES

30:51.400 --> 30:54.000
TO MY MIND IS "RECKLESS."

30:56.700 --> 30:58.467
 I HAVE A CONSTRUCTION CREW

30:56.700 --> 30:58.467
GETTING READY TO CLEAN UP THIS

30:58.467 --> 30:59.833
BUILDING, LIKE, TOMORROW

31:00.633 --> 31:02.533
 I THINK I-I NEED MORE TIME.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.267
 MICHAEL, THE WORD THAT COMES

31:07.100 --> 31:10.267
TO MY MIND IS "RECKLESS."

31:10.267 --> 31:11.800
 YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S--

31:10.267 --> 31:11.800
 THAT WASN'T A RECKLESS

31:11.800 --> 31:13.300
PURCHASE.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.300
 WHAT'S IT'S GONNA COST TO

31:13.300 --> 31:14.767
INSURE?

31:13.300 --> 31:14.767
 GAS, REPAIRS, MAINTENANCE,

31:14.767 --> 31:17.033
ALL THESE THINGS.

31:14.767 --> 31:17.033
 TOLLS, EVERYTHING.

31:17.033 --> 31:18.500
IT'S--YEAH, BUT--

31:17.033 --> 31:18.500
 I FACTORED THAT ALL IN.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.867
 BUT YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.867
YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT TO ME.

31:19.867 --> 31:21.400
YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT TO MARCUS.

31:19.867 --> 31:21.400
YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT TO ALL OF

31:21.400 --> 31:23.167
US.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.167
 LOOK, IT'S A BOLD MOVE, AND I

31:23.167 --> 31:26.500
LIKE THE CONCEPT, BUT HOW ARE WE

31:23.167 --> 31:26.500
GONNA KNOW IF IT MAKES SENSE IF

31:26.500 --> 31:29.200
YOU DON'T RUN THE NUMBERS?

31:26.500 --> 31:29.200
HE'S GOT BETTER IDEAS THAN ALL

31:29.200 --> 31:33.033
OF US, BUT WHAT'S INSIDE YOUR

31:29.200 --> 31:33.033
HEAD HAS TO COME OUT ON PAPER.

31:33.033 --> 31:35.500
 THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED IS

31:33.033 --> 31:35.500
IT HAS TO BE ON PAPER.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.300
 IT BOILS DOWN TO

31:37.000 --> 31:39.633
WE'RE GONNA COMMUNICATE FROM NOW

31:38.167 --> 31:39.633
ON.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.267
 IT'S BEEN 48 HOURS SINCE WE

31:43.800 --> 31:46.267
TOURED THE BUILDING AND MADE THE

31:46.267 --> 31:48.667
DEAL.

31:46.267 --> 31:48.667
I AM EXCITED HOW QUICKLY THINGS

31:48.667 --> 31:52.167
ARE COMING TOGETHER.

31:48.667 --> 31:52.167
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS A LOAN SALE

31:52.167 --> 31:55.567
AGREEMENT.

31:52.167 --> 31:55.567
THE BUILDING IS OFFICIALLY OURS

31:55.567 --> 31:59.967
AS SOON AS RICH SIGNS.

31:55.567 --> 31:59.967
 IT'S, LIKE, SO FAST.

31:59.967 --> 32:03.200
[laughs]

31:59.967 --> 32:03.200
 THE ONE THING I KNOW ABOUT

32:03.200 --> 32:05.567
BUSINESS IS YOU HAVE TO MOVE

32:03.200 --> 32:05.567
QUICKLY, OR YOU'RE GONNA MISS

32:05.567 --> 32:07.467
OUT ON A GOOD DEAL.

32:05.567 --> 32:07.467
 [sighs]

32:07.467 --> 32:10.133
 YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

32:07.467 --> 32:10.133
I KNOW THOSE SIGHS.

32:10.133 --> 32:13.100
 YOU'RE ALL GOOD WITH THIS?

32:10.133 --> 32:13.100
 IT'S WHAT WE WANTED.

32:13.100 --> 32:16.033
 DO YOU SEE A PROBLEM WITH IT?

32:13.100 --> 32:16.033
 [sighs]

32:16.033 --> 32:18.300
NO, I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM

32:16.033 --> 32:18.300
WITH IT.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.400
I-I GUESS I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA

32:18.300 --> 32:20.400
HAVE MORE TIME THINKING ABOUT

32:20.400 --> 32:21.733
IT.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.733
 IT'S WHAT WE WANT.

32:21.733 --> 32:25.133
 MAYBE I NEED MORE TIME.

32:21.733 --> 32:25.133
WHAT'S THAT LOOK FOR?

32:25.133 --> 32:30.467
 I--'CAUSE I--IT'S--

32:25.133 --> 32:30.467
 I THINK I-I NEED MORE TIME.

32:30.467 --> 32:32.500
 I HAVE A CONSTRUCTION CREW

32:30.467 --> 32:32.500
GETTING READY TO CLEAN UP THIS

32:32.500 --> 32:37.633
BUILDING, LIKE, TOMORROW

32:32.500 --> 32:37.633
MORNING, AND I ASKED YOU IF ALL

32:37.633 --> 32:39.367
THESE THINGS, AND YOU KEPT

32:37.633 --> 32:39.367
SAYING TO ME, "WELL, THOSE ARE

32:39.367 --> 32:41.267
ALL IFS.

32:39.367 --> 32:41.267
I NEED TO SEE IT ON PAPER."

32:41.267 --> 32:45.033
WELL, HERE IT IS.

32:41.267 --> 32:45.033
I MEAN, LISTEN, IF YOU WANT TO

32:45.033 --> 32:48.400
KEEP THIS COMPANY A $2-MILLION

32:45.033 --> 32:48.400
COMPANY, THEN JUST KEEP THINGS

32:48.400 --> 32:50.367
THE WAY THEY ARE.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.367
 [sighs]

32:50.367 --> 32:52.733
 WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA GET TO THE

32:50.367 --> 32:52.733
POINT WHERE HE'S GONNA SAY YES

32:52.733 --> 32:54.533
AND THEN AT THE LAST MINUTE HE'S

32:52.733 --> 32:54.533
GONNA SAY NO.

32:54.533 --> 32:57.233
 IT'S JUST--IT'S JUST

32:54.533 --> 32:57.233
OVERWHELMING TO ME.

32:57.233 --> 33:00.133
I JUST--I HOPE YOU GUYS DON'T

32:57.233 --> 33:00.133
GET TOO DISAPPOINTED.

33:00.133 --> 33:03.400
I-I JUST CAN'T SIGN THIS RIGHT

33:00.133 --> 33:03.400
NOW.

33:03.400 --> 33:07.100
I-I JUST CAN'T.

33:03.400 --> 33:07.100
 EVEN THOUGH I'VE GIVEN RICH

33:07.100 --> 33:11.233
EVERYTHING HE NEEDS, HE'S STILL

33:07.100 --> 33:11.233
RELUCTANT TO TAKE RISKS.

33:11.233 --> 33:13.833
LET'S GO TAKE A WALK.

33:11.233 --> 33:13.833
RICH NEEDS TO TAKE A MOMENT AND

33:13.833 --> 33:16.233
CLEAR HIS MIND.

33:13.833 --> 33:16.233
HOPEFULLY, HE'LL GET PAST IT AND

33:16.233 --> 33:20.933
MAKE THIS DEAL HAPPEN.

33:16.233 --> 33:20.933
 I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:20.933 --> 33:26.567
 IT'S TOO FAST.

33:20.933 --> 33:26.567
 THAT MAKES NO SENSE!

33:26.567 --> 33:29.433
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

33:26.567 --> 33:29.433
BACK THERE, BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY

33:29.433 --> 33:32.167
GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND.

33:29.433 --> 33:32.167
 I GOT TOO OVERWHELMED, YOU

33:32.167 --> 33:34.567
KNOW?

33:32.167 --> 33:34.567
ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE REALITY

33:34.567 --> 33:37.800
SET IN.

33:34.567 --> 33:37.800
I GUESS EVERYTHING HAPPENED.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.333
IT CAME TRUE SO FAST.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.333
IT JUST BECAME A LITTLE

33:40.333 --> 33:42.167
OVERWHELMING.

33:40.333 --> 33:42.167
 WHAT I DON'T WANT TO DO IS,

33:42.167 --> 33:44.300
I DON'T WANT TO SELL YOU ON

33:42.167 --> 33:44.300
THIS CONCEPT.

33:44.300 --> 33:46.000
YOU HAVE TO REALLY WANT TO DO

33:44.300 --> 33:46.000
IT.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.467
WHEN I DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD

33:46.000 --> 33:48.467
ON THIS PROJECT, I DID IT FOR

33:48.467 --> 33:53.000
ONE SIMPLE REASON--THE ECONOMICS

33:48.467 --> 33:53.000
GAVE US ONE HECK OF A RETURN, SO

33:53.000 --> 33:56.167
IF WE END UP HAVING $600,000 TO

33:53.000 --> 33:56.167
$800,000 IN THIS BUILDING, IT'S

33:56.167 --> 33:57.600
VERY SIMPLE MATH.

33:56.167 --> 33:57.600
 RIGHT.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.633
 YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU THOUGHT

33:57.600 --> 34:00.633
THE MARGINS THAT WERE

34:00.633 --> 34:05.400
EVAPORATING FROM OUR BUSINESS

34:00.633 --> 34:05.400
WERE ANYWHERE FROM 20% TO 30%.

34:05.400 --> 34:09.033
OUR CURRENT BUSINESS IS

34:05.400 --> 34:09.033
$2 MILLION, SO ON $2 MILLION OF

34:09.033 --> 34:14.699
BUSINESS, IT'S ANYWHERE FROM

34:09.033 --> 34:14.699
$400,000 TO $600,000 A YEAR...

34:14.699 --> 34:16.033
 RIGHT.

34:14.699 --> 34:16.033
 EVAPORATING.

34:16.033 --> 34:17.400
 RIGHT.

34:16.033 --> 34:17.400
 I WANT TO TRY TO BRING THAT

34:17.400 --> 34:21.167
BACK, BUT WHAT'S EVEN MORE

34:17.400 --> 34:21.167
IMPORTANT IS, THAT FACTORY GIVES

34:21.167 --> 34:24.199
US THE ABILITY TO SATISFY THE

34:21.167 --> 34:24.199
DEMAND THAT YOU SAY IS OUT

34:24.199 --> 34:27.266
THERE, SO IT'S JUST--IT'S--RICH,

34:24.199 --> 34:27.266
I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA--AS I SAID

34:27.266 --> 34:28.766
TO YOU EARLIER, I'M NOT GONNA

34:27.266 --> 34:28.766
SELL YOU ON IT.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.900
 RIGHT.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.900
 YOU'RE A SMART GUY.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.733
YOU DO THE MATH.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.733
SO WHETHER I'M A PART OF THIS

34:33.733 --> 34:37.533
BUSINESS OR NOT, THE ICE CREAM

34:33.733 --> 34:37.533
WILL STILL GET MADE, BUT IT

34:37.533 --> 34:39.733
WON'T BE AS PROFITABLE...

34:37.533 --> 34:39.733
 RIGHT.

34:39.733 --> 34:40.967
 IT WON'T BE AS BIG, AND IT

34:42.199 --> 34:46.132
TAKE IT OVER IF YOU DON'T TAKE

34:43.900 --> 34:46.132
THIS STEP.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.199
YOUR NUMBERS WEREN'T RIGHT.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.199
 IT WAS A MISTAKE.

34:51.199 --> 34:55.100
 THIS IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN

34:53.533 --> 34:55.100
AGAIN.

34:59.033 --> 35:03.833
 WHETHER I'M A PART OF THIS

34:59.033 --> 35:03.833
WILL STILL GET MADE, BUT IT

35:03.833 --> 35:06.000
WON'T BE AS PROFITABLE...

35:03.833 --> 35:06.000
 RIGHT.

35:06.000 --> 35:00.000
 IT WON'T BE AS BIG, AND IT

35:06.000 --> 35:00.000
WON'T BE READY FOR MICHAEL TO

35:00.000 --> 35:10.167
BUSINESS OR NOT, THE ICE CREAM

35:00.000 --> 35:10.167
TAKE IT OVER IF YOU DON'T TAKE

35:10.167 --> 35:13.267
THIS STEP.

35:10.167 --> 35:13.267
 I'M--I'M READY.

35:13.267 --> 35:15.367
I-I FEEL BETTER.

35:13.267 --> 35:15.367
YOU KNOW, JUST GETTING OUT AND

35:15.367 --> 35:17.567
CLEARING MY HEAD A LITTLE BIT

35:15.367 --> 35:17.567
AND JUST TALKING TO YOU

35:17.567 --> 35:19.433
ONE-ON-ONE.

35:17.567 --> 35:19.433
I'M--I'M READY.

35:19.433 --> 35:21.333
 YOUR DAD AND YOUR BROTHER

35:19.433 --> 35:21.333
WOULD BE VERY PROUD OF YOU.

35:21.333 --> 35:25.733
 THEY WOULD BE.

35:22.233 --> 35:25.733
THEY WOULD BE.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.733
I KNOW THEY WOULD BE.

35:29.300 --> 35:32.067
 CLEANUP IS FINALLY UNDER WAY

35:29.300 --> 35:32.067
AT THE WAREHOUSE, BUT A BIG

35:32.067 --> 35:33.300
PROBLEM HAS COME UP, AND I NEED

35:34.033 --> 35:35.933
IMMEDIATELY.

35:39.633 --> 35:41.367
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT,

35:39.633 --> 35:41.367
OKAY?

35:41.367 --> 35:42.033
 OKAY.

35:41.367 --> 35:42.033
MICHAEL, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT

35:42.033 --> 35:45.500
 FROM THE BEGINNING, WE'VE

35:42.033 --> 35:45.500
BEEN TALKING ABOUT 600,000...

35:45.500 --> 35:47.933
IS THE BUILDING AND THE BUILD

35:45.500 --> 35:47.933
OUT AND THE EQUIPMENT AND

35:47.933 --> 35:49.900
EVERYTHING.

35:47.933 --> 35:49.900
THE BUILDING COSTS "X."

35:49.900 --> 35:52.200
THE BUILD OUT COSTS "Y."

35:49.900 --> 35:52.200
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT TAKES TO

35:52.200 --> 35:53.633
GET IT ALL THE WAY TO OPEN?

35:52.200 --> 35:53.633
HOW MUCH MONEY?

35:53.633 --> 35:56.533
 $600,000 MARK.

35:53.633 --> 35:56.533
 REMEMBER, I'M RELYING ON YOUR

35:56.533 --> 35:58.933
NUMBERS FOR THE RETURNS, SO...

35:56.533 --> 35:58.933
 IT'S ACCURATE.

35:58.933 --> 36:01.800
 IT'S LOW.

35:58.933 --> 36:01.800
 I MADE THIS INVESTMENT

36:01.800 --> 36:04.100
LARGELY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN

36:01.800 --> 36:04.100
YOU.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.667
I DIDN'T FACTOR IN ALL OF THE

36:04.100 --> 36:06.667
DETAILS BECAUSE I'M NOT AN

36:06.667 --> 36:09.767
ENGINEER OR AN ARCHITECT, AND

36:06.667 --> 36:09.767
I KNEW YOU WERE WORKING ON THE

36:09.767 --> 36:13.833
DRAWINGS, THEN I GET AN EMAIL

36:09.767 --> 36:13.833
THAT SAYS THE BUILDING ISN'T

36:13.833 --> 36:19.200
GONNA COST 600,000.

36:13.833 --> 36:19.200
IT'S GONNA COST 1.3 MILLION.

36:19.200 --> 36:23.567
I HAVE 240,000 IN THE BUILDING.

36:19.200 --> 36:23.567
I HAVE 50,000 IN THE CLEANUP OF

36:23.567 --> 36:26.233
THE BUILDING.

36:23.567 --> 36:26.233
THAT'S ALREADY 300,000, AND WE

36:26.233 --> 36:27.867
HAVEN'T BOUGHT THE EQUIPMENT

36:26.233 --> 36:27.867
YET.

36:27.867 --> 36:31.167
THE EQUIPMENT'S GONNA BE

36:27.867 --> 36:31.167
$200,000, AND TO BUILD OUT THE

36:31.167 --> 36:34.900
SPACE IS GONNA TAKE NEARLY A

36:31.167 --> 36:34.900
$1/2 MILLION.

36:34.900 --> 36:37.667
I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES.

36:34.900 --> 36:37.667
I'M COMMITTED TO YOU...

36:37.667 --> 36:39.400
 MM-HMM.

36:37.667 --> 36:39.400
 I'M COMMITTED TO MR. GREEN

36:39.400 --> 36:42.867
TEA, AND I'M COMMITTED TO YOUR

36:39.400 --> 36:42.867
FAMILY, BUT I AM NOT COMMITTED

36:42.867 --> 36:46.800
TO HAVING NUMBERS DOUBLE ON ME.

36:42.867 --> 36:46.800
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

36:46.800 --> 36:49.800
 I DO.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.800
 I CAN'T MOVE FORWARD...

36:49.800 --> 36:52.833
 MM-HMM.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.833
 IF I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT

36:52.833 --> 36:55.000
THE NUMBERS ARE GONNA BE.

36:52.833 --> 36:55.000
WHEN THE NUMBER CAME BACK AT

36:55.000 --> 36:59.167
1.3 MILLION, YOU KNOW, MORE THAN

36:55.000 --> 36:59.167
DOUBLE WHA--WHAT THE ORIGINAL

36:59.167 --> 37:00.533
ESTIMATE WAS...

36:59.167 --> 37:00.533
 MM-HMM.

37:00.533 --> 37:01.967
 I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU--

37:00.533 --> 37:01.967
 A LITTLE STICKER SHOCK.

37:01.967 --> 37:04.700
 IT--WELL, IT KIND OF PISSED

37:01.967 --> 37:04.700
ME OFF, BECAUSE WE--WE'VE BEEN

37:04.700 --> 37:08.033
TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU

37:04.700 --> 37:08.033
HAVE TO KNOW YOUR NUMBERS.

37:08.033 --> 37:09.367
 MM-HMM.

37:08.033 --> 37:09.367
DO WE KNOW OUR NUMBERS?

37:09.367 --> 37:10.767
NO.

37:09.367 --> 37:10.767
WE WEREN'T 100% ACCURATE ON

37:10.767 --> 37:12.167
THEM.

37:10.767 --> 37:12.167
 I MEAN, REALLY, THE QUESTION

37:12.167 --> 37:15.067
FOR ME WAS, WHEN I GOT THAT

37:12.167 --> 37:15.067
EMAIL IS, "AM I DOING A BAD

37:15.067 --> 37:17.133
DEAL?"

37:15.067 --> 37:17.133
 IT WAS A MISTAKE.

37:17.133 --> 37:18.700
 BUT IT'S A MISTAKE WITH MY

37:17.133 --> 37:18.700
MONEY.

37:18.700 --> 37:21.067
 I KNOW THAT.

37:18.700 --> 37:21.067
I DIDN'T KNOW MY NUMBERS.

37:21.067 --> 37:24.000
IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE, CLEARLY.

37:21.067 --> 37:24.000
 THERE'S THIS OLD ADAGE IN

37:24.000 --> 37:26.433
BUSINESS, RIGHT?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.433
IT'S "UNDERPROMISE AND

37:26.433 --> 37:29.367
OVERDELIVER," AND IN THIS CASE,

37:26.433 --> 37:29.367
WE OVERPROMISED AND

37:29.367 --> 37:33.400
UNDERDELIVERED.

37:29.367 --> 37:33.400
I'M FRUSTRATED, AND I'M ANGRY.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.767
I'M STILL GONNA MOVE FORWARD

37:33.400 --> 37:35.767
WITH THIS DEAL, 'CAUSE I KNOW

37:35.767 --> 37:38.700
THAT MY MONEY IS SAFE WITH THIS

37:35.767 --> 37:38.700
COMPANY, AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA

37:38.700 --> 37:41.800
BE WILDLY PROFITABLE.

37:38.700 --> 37:41.800
I GUESS THE DISAPPOINTING FACTOR

37:41.800 --> 37:44.467
IS, IT'S GONNA TAKE ME A LITTLE

37:41.800 --> 37:44.467
LONGER TO MAKE A RETURN ON MY

37:44.467 --> 37:46.367
INVESTMENT.

37:44.467 --> 37:46.367
LOOK, THIS IS BUSINESS.

37:46.367 --> 37:48.900
 [clears throat]

37:46.367 --> 37:48.900
 YOUR NUMBERS WEREN'T RIGHT.

37:48.900 --> 37:52.033
I NEED TO KNOW FOR SURE THAT

37:48.900 --> 37:52.033
THIS IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN

37:52.033 --> 37:53.500
AGAIN.

37:52.033 --> 37:53.500
 IT IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN

37:53.500 --> 37:54.167
AGAIN.

37:54.833 --> 37:58.033
 YES.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.033
 ALL RIGHT.

38:01.867 --> 38:03.467
 SO I'M REAL EXCITED FOR YOU

38:01.867 --> 38:03.467
TO SEE THE INSIDE.

38:03.467 --> 38:06.433
WE GOT A LOT DONE.

38:03.467 --> 38:06.433
I KNOW YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT

38:06.433 --> 38:08.200
THE $40,000 TO CLEAN THE PLACE

38:06.433 --> 38:08.200
UP.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.667
 FOR THE CLEANUP.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.667
$40,000 TO CLEAN UP GARBAGE?

38:10.667 --> 38:12.267
 DID YOU SEE IT?

38:10.667 --> 38:12.267
 [bleep], I'D HAVE COME DONE

38:12.267 --> 38:14.033
IT MYSELF.

38:12.267 --> 38:14.033
 THERE WAS A LOT TO CLEAN UP,

38:14.033 --> 38:18.133
AND BELIEVE ME, YOU WOULDN'T

38:14.033 --> 38:18.133
 MICHAEL, YOU DID A GREAT JOB

38:18.133 --> 38:15.033
GETTING THIS PLACE CLEANED UP.

38:18.133 --> 38:15.033
 THANK YOU.

38:15.033 --> 38:22.667
HAVE.

38:15.033 --> 38:22.667
 I MEAN, YOU MOVE AS FAST AS I

38:22.667 --> 38:24.567
DO.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.567
 IT HAPPENED QUICK.

38:24.567 --> 38:26.900
 IT'S A GREAT SHELL.

38:24.567 --> 38:26.900
 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.300
IT REALLY IS.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.300
IT JUST NEEDS A LITTLE

38:28.300 --> 38:30.400
POLISHING.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.400
 I'M KIND OF BLOWN AWAY AT

38:30.400 --> 38:33.567
WHAT I SEE AT THE WAREHOUSE.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.567
WE'VE SPENT ALMOST $50,000, AND

38:33.567 --> 38:36.167
WE HAVEN'T EVEN BUILT IT OUT

38:33.567 --> 38:36.167
YET, BUT THE WAREHOUSE LOOKS

38:36.167 --> 38:39.300
AMAZING.

38:36.167 --> 38:39.300
 SO BACK HERE, THE WHOLE

38:39.300 --> 38:40.800
LENGTH OF THE BUILDING IS THE

38:39.300 --> 38:40.800
FREEZER.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.833
THE FREEZER WILL GO THIS WAY,

38:40.800 --> 38:43.833
TRUCKS WILL COME IN HERE, AND

38:43.833 --> 38:46.367
WE'LL HAVE A REALLY EASY

38:43.833 --> 38:46.367
WORKFLOW FROM OUR DELIVERIES

38:46.367 --> 38:48.933
DIRECTLY TO THE PRODUCTION ROOM.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.933
 I'M STARTING TO REALLY SEE

38:48.933 --> 38:50.667
THE VISION THAT MICHAEL'S LAYING

38:48.933 --> 38:50.667
OUT.

38:50.667 --> 38:53.267
WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS,

38:50.667 --> 38:53.267
AND WE'RE MAKING IT FAST.

38:53.267 --> 38:54.767
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A FIRST-CLASS

38:53.267 --> 38:54.767
FACILITY.

38:54.767 --> 38:56.233
PROBABLY THE BEST ON THE EAST

38:54.767 --> 38:56.233
COAST.

38:56.233 --> 38:57.933
 EVERYTHING FROM THE FREEZER

38:56.233 --> 38:57.933
TO THE EQUIPMENT THAT'S COMING

38:57.933 --> 38:59.967
FROM ITALY IS THE BEST IN THE

38:57.933 --> 38:59.967
WORLD.

38:59.967 --> 39:02.000
 AND THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO

38:59.967 --> 39:02.000
SHOW YOUR DAD...

39:02.000 --> 39:03.533
 IS THE INVESTMENT.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.533
 MM-HMM.

39:03.533 --> 39:06.500
 WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

39:03.533 --> 39:06.500
A 20% MARGIN IMPROVEMENT ON THAT

39:06.500 --> 39:07.833
2 MILLION.

39:06.500 --> 39:07.833
 MM-HMM.

39:07.833 --> 39:10.600
 THAT'S A $400,000 ANNUAL

39:07.833 --> 39:10.600
IMPROVEMENT IN MARGIN.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.267
 CORRECT.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.267
 MM-HMM.

39:11.267 --> 39:15.267
 SO IN ABOUT TWO YEARS, WE'RE

39:11.267 --> 39:15.267
GOING TO HAVE OUR MONEY BACK.

39:15.267 --> 39:17.933
AND IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE YOUR DAD,

39:15.267 --> 39:17.933
IF HE WOULD HAVE JUST SAT DOWN

39:17.933 --> 39:19.533
AND DONE THOSE NUMBERS...

39:17.933 --> 39:19.533
 MM-HMM.

39:19.533 --> 39:21.300
 HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT A LONG

39:19.533 --> 39:21.300
TIME AGO.

39:21.300 --> 39:23.567
ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF THIS

39:21.300 --> 39:23.567
PARTICULAR TRANSACTION IS WE'RE

39:23.567 --> 39:26.333
GONNA MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN AN

39:23.567 --> 39:26.333
AMERICAN TOWN THAT WAS HIT HARD

39:26.333 --> 39:29.500
BY THE HURRICANE AND, I THINK,

39:26.333 --> 39:29.500
CAN GET BACK ON ITS FEET VERY

39:29.500 --> 39:31.867
FAST, BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK

39:29.500 --> 39:31.867
TO DO.

39:31.867 --> 39:34.767
KEYPORT, NEW JERSEY, HAS A NEW

39:31.867 --> 39:34.767
ANCHOR.

39:34.767 --> 39:36.100
 MM-HMM.

39:37.600 --> 39:41.667
SCENES FROM THE SHOW, GO ON TO

39:38.967 --> 39:41.667
CNBC.COM/THE-PROFIT.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.833
 OKAY, GUYS.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.833
I AM PROJECTING PROBABLY ABOUT

39:48.833 --> 39:53.267
35% TO 50% GROWTH NEXT YEAR.

39:48.833 --> 39:53.267
 SO YOU THINK WE CAN DO ALMOST

39:53.267 --> 39:57.500
$4 MILLION NEXT YEAR?

39:53.267 --> 39:57.500
 I-I BELIEVE WE CAN.

39:57.500 --> 39:59.467
LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA GROW BY

39:57.500 --> 39:59.467
LEAPS AND BOUNDS.

39:59.467 --> 40:00.833
 THE FACTORY IS SCHEDULED TO

39:59.467 --> 40:00.833
THE COMPANY, IN THIS NEXT YEAR,

40:00.833 --> 40:03.867
OPEN IN THE NEXT 90 DAYS, AND

40:00.833 --> 40:03.867
THE CO-PACKER WILL BE GONE,

40:03.867 --> 40:06.600
WHICH WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY

40:03.867 --> 40:06.600
TO DOUBLE OUR PROFIT FROM

40:06.600 --> 40:11.700
450,000 TO 900,000.

40:06.600 --> 40:11.700
IN ADDITION TO THAT, RICH HAS

40:11.700 --> 40:15.967
$1 MILLION OF ORDERS SITTING ON

40:11.700 --> 40:15.967
ORDERS TO GET PROCESSED VERY

40:15.967 --> 40:16.633
QUICKLY.

40:15.967 --> 40:16.633
HIS DESK, AND I EXPECT THOSE

40:16.633 --> 40:20.333
 I LEARNED ABOUT CALCULATED

40:16.633 --> 40:20.333
RISK.

40:20.333 --> 40:25.767
DECISION YOU MAKE IN A BUSINESS

40:20.333 --> 40:25.767
HAS TO HAVE THAT RISK-REWARD.

40:25.767 --> 40:29.400
 YOU GUYS HAVE PULLED OFF, IN

40:25.767 --> 40:29.400
MY OPINION, WHAT IS ONE OF THE

40:29.400 --> 40:32.033
HARDEST THINGS TO DO IN AMERICAN

40:29.400 --> 40:32.033
BUSINESS, WHICH IS TO HAVE A

40:32.033 --> 40:34.200
FAMILY BUSINESS, BECAUSE SO

40:32.033 --> 40:34.200
EVERYTHING YOU DO, EVERY

40:34.200 --> 40:36.400
OFTEN THE FAILURE RATE IS OFF

40:37.300 --> 40:40.267
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF

40:38.367 --> 40:40.267
YOURSELVES.

40:44.033 --> 40:47.200
KEYPORT CREAMERY IS WELL ON ITS

40:44.033 --> 40:47.200
WAY TO BECOMING A HOUSEHOLD

40:47.200 --> 40:49.167
NAME.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.167
MICHAEL HAS BEEN WORKING REALLY

40:49.167 --> 40:52.100
HARD TO PUSH THE MOCHI AND THE

40:49.167 --> 40:52.100
NEW SOLO PRODUCT LINE.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.367
 $1.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.367
 THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN

40:54.367 --> 40:58.133
FANTASTIC.

40:54.367 --> 40:58.133
WE'RE LOOKING INTO RETAIL SPACE

40:58.133 --> 41:01.233
IN NEW YORK CITY.

40:58.133 --> 41:01.233
YOU'RE A BLOCK AWAY FROM TIMES

41:01.233 --> 41:05.300
SQUARE, AND THE TRAFFIC UP AND

41:01.233 --> 41:05.300
DOWN HERE IS TREMENDOUS.

41:05.300 --> 41:10.767
MR. GREEN TEA CONTINUES TO GROW

41:05.300 --> 41:10.767
ITS RESTAURANT CLIENTELE.

41:10.767 --> 41:12.700
GELATO.

41:10.767 --> 41:12.700
 both: MMM.

41:12.700 --> 41:15.933
 THE EQUIPMENT IS ON ITS WAY

41:12.700 --> 41:15.933
OVER FROM ITALY, AND ONCE IT'S

41:15.933 --> 41:18.967
INSTALLED, WE'LL HAVE ONE OF THE

41:15.933 --> 41:18.967
MOST STATE-OF-THE-ART ICE CREAM

41:18.967 --> 41:21.433
MANUFACTURERS ON THE ENTIRE EAST

41:18.967 --> 41:21.433
COAST.

41:21.433 --> 41:24.833
THE BUILDING WILL BE ABLE TO

41:21.433 --> 41:24.833
PRODUCE 1,600 GALLONS OF ICE

41:24.833 --> 41:27.733
CREAM A DAY.

41:24.833 --> 41:27.733
IT'LL HAVE OVER 18,000 SQUARE

41:27.733 --> 41:31.900
FEET OF CUBIC FREEZER SPACE TO

41:27.733 --> 41:31.900
STORE ALL THE PRODUCT.

41:31.900 --> 41:33.300
THE MAYOR OF KEYPORT HAS GIVEN

41:31.900 --> 41:33.300
 I HAVE OUR NEW COCONUT

41:33.300 --> 41:38.633
US THE CITY'S STAMP OF APPROVAL

41:33.300 --> 41:38.633
TO BUILD OUT THE WAREHOUSE.

41:38.633 --> 41:39.967
 ALL RIGHT!

41:38.633 --> 41:39.967
 YEAH.

41:39.967 --> 41:41.600
 WHOO-HOO!

41:39.967 --> 41:41.600
 IT'S GOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

41:41.600 --> 41:44.200
JOBS AS WELL AS SPRUCING UP THE

41:41.600 --> 41:44.200
AREA.

41:44.200 --> 41:47.067
 MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE

41:44.200 --> 41:47.067
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHER AND

41:47.067 --> 41:50.867
SON IS THE BEST IT'S EVER BEEN,

41:47.067 --> 41:50.867
AND THEY HAVE A NEWFOUND RESPECT

41:50.867 --> 41:53.567
FOR EACH OTHER.

41:50.867 --> 41:53.567
THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND AT

41:53.567 --> 41:59.367
ALL THAT MR. GREEN TEA WILL BE A

41:53.567 --> 41:59.367
RICHARD'S FATHER PROUDER THAN

41:59.367 --> 42:04.767
HE COULD EVER IMAGINE.

41:59.367 --> 42:04.767
AND NOW, AN UPDATE.

42:04.767 --> 42:07.667
A FEW MONTHS AGO, I CAME TO THE

42:04.767 --> 42:07.667
AID OF A STRUGGLING FLORIST IN

42:07.667 --> 41:55.900
PASADENA, CALIFORNIA,

42:07.667 --> 41:55.900
JACOB MAARSE FLOWERS, AND I

41:55.900 --> 42:12.933
NATIONAL BRAND AND MAKE

41:55.900 --> 42:12.933
ENDED UP SPENDING QUITE A BIT OF

42:12.933 --> 42:15.467
MONEY.

42:12.933 --> 42:15.467
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK I'VE

42:15.467 --> 42:18.733
SPENT?

42:15.467 --> 42:18.733
 AT LEAST 150,000.

42:18.733 --> 42:20.433
 WE HAD A DEAL.

42:18.733 --> 42:20.433
WE HAVE A DEAL?

42:20.433 --> 42:22.300
 DEAL.

42:20.433 --> 42:22.300
 BUT AT THE END OF MY WEEK,

42:22.300 --> 42:25.800
HANK MAARSE DECIDED HE DIDN'T

42:22.300 --> 42:25.800
NEED A PARTNER.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.633
 I'M NOT GONNA TAKE YOUR DEAL.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.633
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID,

42:27.633 --> 42:29.300
SPENT.

42:27.633 --> 42:29.300
I MEAN, I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

42:29.300 --> 42:31.233
 YOU'RE A PUNK, HANK!

42:29.300 --> 42:31.233
YOU BETTER CALL YOUR MAMA AND

42:31.233 --> 42:34.633
GET MY MONEY BACK.

42:31.233 --> 42:34.633
I WAS ANGRY, AND I PLANNED TO

42:34.633 --> 42:37.167
TAKE LEGAL ACTION.

42:34.633 --> 42:37.167
GET OUT OF MY FACE.

42:37.167 --> 42:39.900
BUT AFTER THE SHOW AIRED, I GOT

42:37.167 --> 42:39.900
A CALL FROM HANK'S MOM,

42:39.900 --> 42:43.100
CLARA MAARSE.

42:39.900 --> 42:43.100
SHE HONORED HER WORD AND PAID ME

42:43.100 --> 42:44.767
BACK.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.767
 WE'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY
