WEBVTT

00:02.927 --> 00:05.294
Come on, man. I've shown you
this like, a million times.

00:06.219 --> 00:09.399
Look, pretty much, the
entire backbone of ska music

00:09.424 --> 00:11.524
is upstrokes on the offbeat, right?

00:11.680 --> 00:13.446
That's ska music.

00:15.370 --> 00:16.997
I don't even know what ska is.

00:17.064 --> 00:18.698
Can we learn the Lumineers
or Kurt Vile,

00:18.734 --> 00:20.600
'cause that's what's cool right now.

00:20.675 --> 00:22.868
Parker, you're in seventh grade.
You don't know what's cool.

00:22.893 --> 00:23.986
Everyone around you is getting blown up

00:24.011 --> 00:25.041
on exploding hover boards.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.660
Yeah, but the lucky ones
get settlements.

00:26.685 --> 00:28.312
Look, Aunt Renee says you wanna be

00:28.337 --> 00:29.586
a professional musician, right?

00:29.611 --> 00:31.546
- Yeah.
- This song can be your ticket in.

00:31.571 --> 00:34.061
My new dad Rodney is a lawyer
for a big music label,

00:34.086 --> 00:35.842
and that's gonna be my ticket in.

00:35.867 --> 00:37.169
Parker, come on.

00:37.194 --> 00:40.162
No one in life is just gonna hand
you stuff. You gotta earn it.

00:40.388 --> 00:41.488
Unless you're a beautiful woman;

00:41.513 --> 00:42.722
that advice doesn't apply to you.

00:42.747 --> 00:45.042
Parker, you have to work
hard and earn it,

00:45.073 --> 00:46.895
like Benji, who lives with his brother,

00:46.920 --> 00:48.887
and sells his dad's
old golf clubs on eBay.

00:48.912 --> 00:50.862
I'm giving a guitar lesson right now.

00:50.887 --> 00:52.087
I'm making money; I'm an earner.

00:52.112 --> 00:53.533
I'm an earner.

00:53.735 --> 00:55.883
- Look at this.
- Ugh.

00:55.908 --> 00:58.595
So viscous. Is that upstairs
slime or downstairs slime?

00:58.620 --> 01:00.264
I don't know what you mean by that,

01:00.289 --> 01:02.508
but clearly, you're out of
touch with important trends.

01:02.533 --> 01:04.301
People are paying big bucks
for small batches

01:04.325 --> 01:06.005
of homemade slime on Etsy,

01:06.095 --> 01:08.295
and you're damn straight your
girl's gettin' in the game.

01:08.323 --> 01:09.910
I think this is the right viscosity,

01:09.935 --> 01:12.594
but Parker, does this look
like kids will like it?

01:12.621 --> 01:15.031
Uhh... Yeah. Yeah,
you're getting there.

01:15.531 --> 01:17.925
I didn't know you were profiting
off your retainer scrapings.

01:17.950 --> 01:20.012
It's very "using every
part of the buffalo" of you.

01:20.037 --> 01:21.404
- Thank you.
- What's your plan?

01:21.429 --> 01:23.389
- What are you saving money for?
- Rhianna tickets.

01:23.414 --> 01:25.375
She's a dancer-entrepreneur
icon like myself,

01:25.400 --> 01:26.599
so we have to support each other.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.561
Yeah-yeah, Rhianna needs
your support, totally.

01:28.770 --> 01:30.980
All right, so, with this ska stuff...

01:31.005 --> 01:33.005
Don't teach him your ska music.

01:33.281 --> 01:34.480
Parker, listen to me.

01:34.576 --> 01:36.014
You need to learn about cool stuff

01:36.039 --> 01:38.762
like podcasts about unsolved murders.

01:38.815 --> 01:40.952
Look, this song is cool.

01:40.977 --> 01:43.678
I wrote it for my high school ska
band, the Ska-nold Trumpets.

01:43.752 --> 01:46.126
That was before ska and Donald
Trump got super embarrassing,

01:46.151 --> 01:47.765
and were only, like,
kind of embarrassing.

01:47.789 --> 01:49.556
Wait. You wrote that?

01:49.591 --> 01:51.086
I didn't know you had any talent.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.530
The truth is that ska
used to be really popular,

01:53.555 --> 01:55.421
and it's probably gonna
be popular again.

01:55.564 --> 01:57.480
The music industry
works in cycles, right?

01:57.593 --> 01:59.579
Like how Selena Gomez
is really just J.Lo

01:59.604 --> 02:00.686
without the ability to sing or dance.

02:00.711 --> 02:02.953
- Don't. Don't do this.
- What?

02:02.978 --> 02:04.033
Take it back.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.138
- Take what back?
- Take back

02:05.163 --> 02:06.532
what you said about Selena, okay?

02:06.557 --> 02:08.663
- It's unacceptable.
- She seems like a nice girl,

02:08.689 --> 02:10.689
and she's pretty,
but she's not talented.

02:10.714 --> 02:11.814
Okay, I will walk out that door

02:11.839 --> 02:13.030
and you will never see me again.

02:13.061 --> 02:14.255
This is why Bieber left her.

02:14.280 --> 02:17.359
He didn't leave her.
She upgraded to The Weekend.

02:17.451 --> 02:18.899
Know your stuff, man.

02:18.924 --> 02:20.291
There's no upgrade after Bieber.

02:20.316 --> 02:21.565
No one likes Bieber, okay?

02:21.590 --> 02:23.551
- You can have Bieber.
- Everyone likes Bieber.

02:23.576 --> 02:24.729
You can go get Bieber. You and Bieber

02:24.754 --> 02:26.401
will be by yourself on an island.

02:26.567 --> 02:28.891
Fine. I wanna be on
an island with Bieber.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.269
- Yeah, me, too.
- We'll collab and stuff.

02:34.848 --> 02:35.888
Okay, so...

02:35.931 --> 02:37.797
Take your index finger
and put it on the third fret.

02:37.822 --> 02:39.042
Parker, time to go.

02:39.067 --> 02:41.422
We have the chef coming tonight,
he's making paella.

02:41.447 --> 02:43.807
His paella tastes like dog dingus.

02:43.832 --> 02:45.589
Okay, in the car now,

02:45.614 --> 02:47.891
or you can just forget about
your video game camp.

02:47.916 --> 02:49.759
It's a Call of Duty tournament.

02:50.297 --> 02:52.367
For the millionth time.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.346
You can tell we're related
by how angry yet coddled he is.

02:55.371 --> 02:57.018
Are you coming to the bar
mitzvah this weekend?

02:57.043 --> 02:58.306
It's a music theme.

02:58.331 --> 03:00.711
Yes, I'm gonna be there. My mom
will kill me if I don't go.

03:00.901 --> 03:02.986
Bar mitzvahs have gotten so elaborate.

03:03.011 --> 03:07.583
All of his friends have music
videos and home movies.

03:07.608 --> 03:09.604
Do you know anyone
with music video experience?

03:09.629 --> 03:12.174
Ohw, well, I make memes
and GIF's all day.

03:12.199 --> 03:13.580
I could make a music video.

03:13.605 --> 03:14.625
And I already taught him a really

03:14.650 --> 03:16.139
great song today. We're good to go.

03:16.164 --> 03:18.548
That's terrific. I will, of
course, cover all the costs.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.440
Wow. Thanks.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.525
Renee, I'm so glad I caught you.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.017
I just wanted to let you know

03:24.042 --> 03:26.108
that I am available for babysitting,

03:26.133 --> 03:29.422
and have very competitive rates,
and I'm open to negotiation.

03:29.447 --> 03:31.582
Okay, I have a spin class.

03:32.251 --> 03:33.839
"I have spin class."

03:33.864 --> 03:35.827
That's how bored housewives
get away from you.

03:35.852 --> 03:39.028
Ugh! God, I'm busting my ass
making slime.

03:39.053 --> 03:41.239
I gotta get back into
nannying for rich families.

03:41.264 --> 03:42.530
I mean, that's where the money is.

03:42.577 --> 03:45.034
I know. Rich people fridges
are the best.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.090
They always have
small-batch nut butters.

03:47.115 --> 03:48.759
I once went to
this billionaire's house.

03:48.784 --> 03:51.360
He had pistachio butter. Like,
what is that? My mind was blown.

03:51.385 --> 03:53.963
Oh, my God. That sounds so gross.

03:53.988 --> 03:55.737
I wanna try pistachio butter.

03:55.762 --> 03:57.695
And don't ever look at my eyes
when you say nut butter.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.886
That was gross.

03:58.911 --> 04:00.220
You should help me
with the music video.

04:00.245 --> 04:02.379
What? You're really
considering doing that?

04:02.404 --> 04:05.339
Yeah. His new dad knows
so many record industry people.

04:05.433 --> 04:07.099
Industry people?

04:07.124 --> 04:09.090
Me likey the sound of that.

04:10.691 --> 04:12.591
I'm working on my Italian accent.

04:13.027 --> 04:16.177
<i>Buenos noches.</i> Buenos Aires.

04:16.221 --> 04:19.696
Dude, if my music video crushes
in front of those people,

04:19.721 --> 04:21.176
who knows what could happen.

04:21.201 --> 04:24.511
I might reawaken ska for a whole
new generation of music fans.

04:24.619 --> 04:27.353
Oh, Benji. Maybe.

04:27.888 --> 04:30.120
If you help me,
I'll work you into budget.

04:30.191 --> 04:32.002
Aunt Renee's paying for everything.

04:32.060 --> 04:35.027
I'll say you're a stand-in
for a top-heavy young boy.

04:35.102 --> 04:36.507
Help you out with
those Rhianna tickets.

04:36.532 --> 04:38.040
I'll do it.

04:38.225 --> 04:40.816
But I have to see your directing
reel first obviously.

04:40.841 --> 04:41.974
Yeah, totally.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:11.358 --> 05:13.403
You said you wanted
to see my director's reel.

05:13.428 --> 05:15.261
I'm dying, and I'm fine with it.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.178
This is how I wanna go.

05:17.699 --> 05:19.532
Why are you dancing like that?

05:19.557 --> 05:21.958
It's like you're trying
to escape your lack of rhythm,

05:21.983 --> 05:24.050
but you just can't do it.

05:24.252 --> 05:26.216
Guys, this was cool back then.

05:28.449 --> 05:29.907
- Stop.
- No, please, please.

05:29.932 --> 05:31.298
I need to own this at all times.

05:31.619 --> 05:33.586
It's not fair to judge it
by today's standards.

05:33.654 --> 05:34.886
The production values are weak.

05:34.911 --> 05:37.754
I'm judging it by middle
school talent show standards,

05:37.779 --> 05:39.746
and it's terrible.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.415
Oh, no. Oh, what happened there?

05:42.440 --> 05:43.982
We never finished the video.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.428
We couldn't decide on
a name for the album.

05:45.453 --> 05:46.956
They wanted to name it
<i>Ska-lute Your Shorts,</i>

05:46.981 --> 05:49.373
I wanted to name it <i>Harry Potter
and the Ska-blet of Fire.</i>

05:50.016 --> 05:51.712
Stop laughing at me.

05:51.845 --> 05:54.385
Oh, man, I could see
how that would really

05:54.410 --> 05:55.478
tear the band apart...

05:55.503 --> 05:57.636
Those two red-hot options there.

05:58.011 --> 06:00.248
Guys, this was a dark time for me.

06:00.334 --> 06:02.716
I had to quit the band
for creative reasons,

06:02.796 --> 06:04.629
and my song never got out there.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.998
They all went goth,

06:06.133 --> 06:08.676
I developed an unhealthy
relationship with Minesweeper.

06:08.701 --> 06:09.870
- It was bad.
- Listen,

06:09.895 --> 06:11.908
when they do the <i> Behind The Music</i>

06:11.933 --> 06:14.330
for this band of yours,
leave out the Minesweeper part.

06:14.355 --> 06:15.772
You don't want your fans
killing themselves.

06:15.797 --> 06:17.498
Are you gonna let me
borrow the equipment or not?

06:17.523 --> 06:18.943
Absolutely not.

06:18.968 --> 06:22.019
I take being AV manager very seriously,

06:22.044 --> 06:23.844
even though I only got this job
because no one else

06:23.869 --> 06:24.958
in the comedy club wanted it.

06:24.983 --> 06:26.072
I would've done it.

06:26.097 --> 06:29.304
Regardless, this equipment
is for recording people

06:29.329 --> 06:30.586
that perform at the club, okay,

06:30.611 --> 06:32.411
not some rich kid's vanity project.

06:33.253 --> 06:35.220
Okay, Jeff,

06:35.442 --> 06:38.223
here's the thing that
Benji boy isn't telling you.

06:38.286 --> 06:41.050
I am actually the star
of this music video,

06:41.075 --> 06:43.885
and technically, you won't
be breaking any rules

06:43.910 --> 06:45.023
by lending us the equipment

06:45.048 --> 06:46.968
because I am a performer of this club.

06:47.521 --> 06:49.628
Have you guys ever worked together?

06:49.697 --> 06:51.728
Yeah. Lunch orders...

06:52.092 --> 06:54.059
We share a creative thread, you know.

06:54.084 --> 06:55.265
As long as she doesn't freak out

06:55.290 --> 06:56.975
when the craft doesn't
have curly fries, we're cool.

06:57.006 --> 06:59.162
Okay, well, that spice on curly fries

06:59.187 --> 07:00.614
should be on all fries, it's so good.

07:00.661 --> 07:02.828
Wait. That is a song.

07:02.853 --> 07:05.458
That should be a song.
Someone write that down.

07:15.049 --> 07:16.698
- "Erreally"?
- Erreally, yeah.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.437
That's not a word.

07:19.579 --> 07:20.945
What do you mean, it's not a word?

07:20.970 --> 07:23.251
Words are living and breathing things.
That's how words work.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.327
No, that's not how words work.

07:24.352 --> 07:25.933
If you're speaking,
and you're saying it,

07:25.958 --> 07:28.450
- that's a word, by law.
- You're not a lyricist.

07:28.475 --> 07:30.409
How can I be a lyricist if I don't try?

07:30.434 --> 07:33.101
- I study hip-hop.
- What course do you take?

07:33.747 --> 07:34.946
The streets.

07:34.971 --> 07:37.423
Oh, yeah, this is gonna be a disaster.

07:37.565 --> 07:39.464
- I'm in.
- You're welcome.

07:47.603 --> 07:49.095
That's you singing?

07:49.126 --> 07:51.037
I thought a feral cat
was getting its nipples pierced.

07:51.062 --> 07:52.929
Ha ha ha. Very funny.

07:52.954 --> 07:55.522
It's actually illegal
to pierce an animal.

07:55.653 --> 07:58.990
I took Dusty to the mall
when I was in fifth grade...

07:59.015 --> 08:01.445
What exactly is this place?

08:01.537 --> 08:03.318
It feels like it's haunted

08:03.343 --> 08:05.227
by the ghost of
middle-class Ikea shoppers.

08:05.348 --> 08:07.090
When my parents evict somebody,

08:07.142 --> 08:09.163
they take all their stuff
and dump it here.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.322
- Oh.
- Look, a baby. Just kidding.

08:11.348 --> 08:14.071
You know what? Maybe we should
shoot outside in the sunlight,

08:14.096 --> 08:16.223
'cause the lighting in here
is not working for me.

08:16.257 --> 08:17.318
Absolutely not.

08:17.343 --> 08:19.737
I've got a vision for this,
and it's gotta happen my way.

08:19.762 --> 08:21.366
All right, your vision, Scorsese,

08:21.391 --> 08:23.572
but this equipment is very expensive,

08:23.666 --> 08:25.605
so I don't want
any food or drink near it.

08:25.654 --> 08:27.461
- What about...
- Yes, that includes Bugles.

08:27.543 --> 08:30.676
It's a comedy club camera.
It's 100% been vomited on.

08:30.746 --> 08:32.390
Hey, don't disrespect our crew.

08:32.414 --> 08:33.695
Gotcha.

08:33.724 --> 08:35.590
All right, all right, all right.

08:35.664 --> 08:38.030
No horseplay, and that's
your warning, Esther.

08:38.174 --> 08:40.611
- She started it.
- You started it. That's your warning.

08:40.635 --> 08:44.048
Listen, 30% of all workplace
accidents are due to horseplay.

08:44.153 --> 08:46.363
What's the other 70%?
I've never been in a workplace.

08:46.388 --> 08:48.355
Quick math. I'm impressed.

08:48.624 --> 08:51.879
Roughhousing. Now, I think
we should set up down there.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.672
There's no visible
exit signs around here.

08:53.697 --> 08:55.373
No, we're not changing the set, guys.

08:55.398 --> 08:58.099
Like I said, this is my vision.
No compromises.

08:58.361 --> 09:00.331
Fine. Maybe if someone gets hurt,

09:00.356 --> 09:02.076
a jury will see this thing.

09:02.572 --> 09:04.337
Okay, so, let's get started.

09:04.362 --> 09:06.044
Esther, I need you
to get into wardrobe,

09:06.069 --> 09:07.992
I'm gonna go to Parker's
green room and check in on him.

09:08.017 --> 09:09.696
Parker has a green room?
I need a green room.

09:09.726 --> 09:13.123
Dude, I put it in our contracts...
most favored nations.

09:13.148 --> 09:15.110
And I don't know exactly
what that means,

09:15.135 --> 09:17.232
but I heard it on <i>Entertainment
Tonight,</i> and I need it.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.618
Look, dude, you promised

09:18.643 --> 09:20.171
to get soda for everyone,
and you didn't.

09:20.196 --> 09:21.311
- That's a breach of contract.
- How do you know there's not

09:21.336 --> 09:22.462
- soda in my bag?
- Breach of contract,

09:22.487 --> 09:23.498
- No.
- breach of contract.

09:23.523 --> 09:25.498
I forgot intentionally
'cause I care about your health.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.837
Parker, why aren't you in wardrobe?

09:29.950 --> 09:31.732
Signature ska look, man.

09:31.767 --> 09:34.044
Checkered shoes,
golf socks, skinny tie.

09:34.069 --> 09:37.690
We discussed this. Why are you
Marlon Brando-ing me right now?

09:37.760 --> 09:39.616
Is Marlon Brando a ska band?

09:39.641 --> 09:41.541
No. He was just difficult on set,

09:41.566 --> 09:43.222
especially on <i>The Island of Dr. Moreau.</i>

09:43.247 --> 09:44.735
Well, this is what I'm wearing.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.552
Let me just. Parker.

09:46.730 --> 09:48.820
- Don't lick me.
- I'm not licking you.

09:48.898 --> 09:51.032
You're basically licking me.

09:51.154 --> 09:53.151
Okay. You're lucky
the first rule of ska

09:53.176 --> 09:54.976
is always have
an extra set of suspenders.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.683
Nobody knows what ska is anymore.

09:58.708 --> 10:01.986
Parker, my baby, they will, okay?

10:02.011 --> 10:04.015
Just help me out a little,
and your new dad's gonna be

10:04.040 --> 10:06.477
super proud of you. Okay? All right?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.436
Rodney loves everything that I do.

10:12.081 --> 10:13.595
Everything okay?

10:13.629 --> 10:15.437
Yeah, he just needed
some wardrobe help.

10:15.462 --> 10:18.363
You know, even Bowie had a makeup girl.

10:18.394 --> 10:20.020
Okay, where do you want me?

10:20.076 --> 10:21.213
Are the pearls too much?

10:21.238 --> 10:23.595
They're actually a cat toy
I found at a pet shop.

10:23.620 --> 10:26.700
Esther, the character
breakdown said rock groupie

10:26.725 --> 10:29.006
with questionable morals.
That is not this.

10:29.031 --> 10:30.998
Oh, I know, but, um,

10:31.187 --> 10:33.053
I can't sexy dance
around 12-year-old boys.

10:33.078 --> 10:35.145
I'm a babysitting entrepreneur, okay?

10:35.230 --> 10:38.031
Today, I'm playing the role
of the responsible caregiver.

10:38.140 --> 10:40.265
I hate that. I just hate that idea.

10:40.290 --> 10:41.650
It's gonna be great. All the parents

10:41.675 --> 10:42.951
will hire me to be their babysitter,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.435
and then, I'm front row at Rhianna.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.140
Come on, man, I'm trying to make

10:46.165 --> 10:48.371
my music video look cool, okay?

10:48.396 --> 10:51.370
The way to not do that is by also
making it a nanny commercial.

10:51.395 --> 10:53.361
I'm putting my foot down.

10:53.535 --> 10:54.669
You wear a size four.

10:54.694 --> 10:56.211
Putting your foot down,
what does that accomplish?

10:56.236 --> 10:58.070
Ruth Bader Ginsburg wears a size four,

10:58.095 --> 10:59.562
and she puts her foot
down all the time,

10:59.587 --> 11:02.747
- and it never budges.
- Gotta do this. Losing daylight.

11:02.772 --> 11:04.065
What are you talking about?
We're indoors.

11:04.090 --> 11:05.192
- Daylight's not an issue.
- Yeah, but

11:05.217 --> 11:06.404
I have to get this equipment back

11:06.429 --> 11:08.010
before the stand-up sets start.

11:08.097 --> 11:10.054
If I don't, they'll bump me
back down to ticket taker

11:10.079 --> 11:11.312
and that's paper-cut city, man,

11:11.337 --> 11:13.337
- now tick-tock.
- Fine.

11:13.408 --> 11:16.376
Yeah, let's get started. I have
a hard out in five minutes.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.905
Parker, you're invited to set.

11:18.413 --> 11:20.346
Stop laughing at me, everybody.

11:20.402 --> 11:22.723
There you are. Let's make some magic.

11:23.610 --> 11:26.418
- Parker, your hair is looking so sharp.
- Thanks.

11:26.443 --> 11:28.766
Why aren't you wearing shoes?
Your mom's an anti-vaxxer.

11:28.791 --> 11:30.288
You really think you ever
got a tetanus shot?

11:30.313 --> 11:32.623
I wanna be alt-folk,
like the Lumineers.

11:32.648 --> 11:35.592
Parker, you freakin' poser.
Alt-folk is a sham.

11:35.617 --> 11:38.188
You think the Lumineers
tour in an Oregon trail wagon?

11:38.213 --> 11:40.141
Come on, man, use your head.

11:40.755 --> 11:42.028
Action.

11:42.059 --> 11:43.721
Oh, that's where you're
gonna put the camera?

11:43.808 --> 11:45.195
Action!

11:52.075 --> 11:53.741
Esther, you're playing it
a little bit big.

11:53.766 --> 11:55.732
- Let's pull it back a little.
- Okay.

12:00.770 --> 12:02.747
You're supposed to hand him the ska CD.

12:02.772 --> 12:04.857
That's what leads him
down the dark path of ruin.

12:04.903 --> 12:06.520
He looked hungry.

12:06.555 --> 12:08.489
Thank you. I am hungry.

12:08.616 --> 12:10.893
Guys, there's no chatting
when we're rolling, okay?

12:10.918 --> 12:12.078
Then don't provoke us.

12:12.103 --> 12:14.248
- Just hand him the CD.
- Got it.

12:15.632 --> 12:17.988
Oh, did you hurt yourself?

12:18.013 --> 12:19.511
What are you doing?

12:19.878 --> 12:21.266
He has a boo-boo.

12:21.291 --> 12:22.991
That's a cut. Cut!

12:23.016 --> 12:24.115
Come here. I need to talk to you.

12:24.507 --> 12:26.640
- Come here.
- What?

12:27.007 --> 12:28.481
Just need you to hand him the CD,

12:28.506 --> 12:30.101
it's really simple. It's the
whole point of all of this.

12:30.126 --> 12:32.790
You know I don't touch
outdated media; it's cursed.

12:32.815 --> 12:34.140
Let's just do it my way now,

12:34.165 --> 12:35.932
and we'll do it your way later.

12:36.452 --> 12:37.998
Just give him the CD.

12:38.023 --> 12:39.298
Don't do it, Esther.

12:39.441 --> 12:41.241
- Don't do it.
- Shut up.

12:41.570 --> 12:42.978
- Make me.
- Take it.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.717
- Make me.
- Just take direction.

12:44.742 --> 12:45.983
- Please.
- I hate direction.

12:46.008 --> 12:47.208
- You guys.
- Shut up, Jeff!

12:47.269 --> 12:49.236
I am gonna come off
as a great babysitter.

12:49.572 --> 12:51.539
She's stronger than
she seems, you know that.

12:51.564 --> 12:53.674
- You're a bad influence on Parker.
- You're a bad influence.

12:53.699 --> 12:56.101
- Don't hit.
- Not around the equipment.

12:56.246 --> 12:57.980
Ohw...

12:58.005 --> 13:01.534
Unbelievable. What did we
just learn about horseplay?

13:01.621 --> 13:03.221
I'm sorry, Jeff.

13:03.318 --> 13:05.986
You just never think you're
gonna become a statistic.

13:06.011 --> 13:08.366
Your privileges are revoked.

13:08.511 --> 13:11.549
If I can't honor the title
of comedy club AV guy,

13:11.574 --> 13:14.411
- then what can I do?
- You're right I'm out of here.

13:14.557 --> 13:16.110
You're just gonna storm off set?

13:16.135 --> 13:18.012
Maybe. I don't remember
how to get out of here,

13:18.037 --> 13:19.616
and I can't see the exit signs.

13:19.641 --> 13:20.999
I'm the star of this video.

13:21.024 --> 13:23.216
If anyone's gonna storm
off the set, it's gonna be me.

13:25.561 --> 13:27.595
I actually went the wrong way.

13:32.623 --> 13:33.655
Come on, man.

13:33.690 --> 13:35.661
Let's finish this thing. Let's go.

13:35.795 --> 13:37.859
There's nothing to finish.
Jeff is taking the equipment.

13:37.895 --> 13:40.188
So? People make movies on phones

13:40.213 --> 13:42.339
that get nominated for Academy Awards.

13:42.718 --> 13:44.084
Don't fact-check that.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.034
You want to hear some ska
poetry, real big fish.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.161
I'm giving up because
I know everything sucks.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.685
Dude...

13:51.335 --> 13:53.639
Benji, this is the first time

13:53.670 --> 13:55.278
I've ever seen you
actually care about something,

13:55.303 --> 13:56.929
and I'm not gonna let you give up

13:56.954 --> 14:00.072
over a few tiny yet important
creative improvements.

14:00.566 --> 14:02.420
You're just trying to
trick rich moms into thinking

14:02.445 --> 14:03.682
you know how to call poison control.

14:03.707 --> 14:05.334
No one really knows how
to call poison control.

14:05.359 --> 14:06.637
We're all just pretending.

14:06.676 --> 14:09.367
Yes, my financial future depends
on the success of this video,

14:09.392 --> 14:11.205
but that doesn't mean you
should turn your back

14:11.230 --> 14:12.282
on your song, man.

14:12.307 --> 14:13.644
- Come on.
- Whatever.

14:13.669 --> 14:14.828
Quitting gets a bad rap.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.615
It feels so good.

14:18.006 --> 14:20.140
I hate that you're making me do this.

14:20.596 --> 14:22.219
Benji, your song isn't that bad.

14:22.244 --> 14:24.201
Okay? I'm not saying it's good,

14:24.226 --> 14:25.987
and I'm not even saying
I think it's a real song,

14:26.012 --> 14:29.646
but I think somewhere,
someone could like it.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.748
- Thanks.
- Let's do this.

14:31.773 --> 14:33.740
You're the first girl
to say something nice about it

14:33.765 --> 14:35.157
who isn't wearing a bowling shirt.

14:35.182 --> 14:37.581
I believe that. I surely do.

14:41.470 --> 14:43.236
This thing turned out great.

14:43.266 --> 14:44.857
I'm glad you talked me
into finishing it.

14:44.882 --> 14:47.188
I mean, this is my best work to date.

14:47.213 --> 14:50.509
I feel like I'm watching a Norma
Jean Baker in the making.

14:50.534 --> 14:52.570
All I have to do now
is have sex with Tomb Raider,

14:52.595 --> 14:54.620
and high school Benji's 100% validated.

14:54.645 --> 14:55.861
High school Esther would wonder

14:55.886 --> 14:58.269
why I'm not having
more picnics in cemeteries.

14:58.294 --> 15:00.864
I really thought that was
gonna be a bigger thing for me.

15:01.071 --> 15:03.335
It's almost like
lonely and didn't have friends.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.126
Did you mean it
when you said this was good,

15:05.151 --> 15:07.218
or did you just say that
so I'd go back in and finish?

15:07.290 --> 15:08.920
Let's not poke holes in success.

15:33.689 --> 15:35.170
Kids suck at dancing.

15:35.298 --> 15:36.574
I feel bad for their parents.

15:36.599 --> 15:38.216
I feel bad for Parker, man.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.364
They kinda went low budget
on his bar mitzvah.

15:40.389 --> 15:41.733
His brother had a glass blower,

15:41.758 --> 15:43.825
a baby tiger. Aunt Renee!

15:44.346 --> 15:46.497
We were just saying
how you totally nailed

15:46.522 --> 15:47.550
the music theme here.

15:47.575 --> 15:49.581
I just wanted to say,
where is Uncle Rodney?

15:49.606 --> 15:50.629
I've been looking for him all night.

15:50.654 --> 15:52.297
You know I wanna meet
this guy, come on.

15:52.322 --> 15:53.992
- Where you hiding him?
- He's running late.

15:54.017 --> 15:55.347
He was just negotiating

15:55.372 --> 15:58.997
a huge record contract
for a certain child celebrity.

15:59.022 --> 16:00.426
Oh, my God, is it Blue Ivy?

16:00.451 --> 16:01.931
- Totally Blue Ivy.
- Oh, my God.

16:01.956 --> 16:03.823
Correct me if I'm wrong;
isn't Blue Ivy, like, six?

16:03.848 --> 16:06.145
Are they remixing the alphabet
song to be a club single?

16:06.170 --> 16:09.027
What, are you crazy?
My singing career peaked at six.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.823
I wanna thank you,
Benji, for helping with Parker.

16:11.848 --> 16:13.322
He's been rehearsing day and night.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.184
I've literally never
seen him this disciplined.

16:15.209 --> 16:17.522
He is just such a sweet boy.

16:17.547 --> 16:19.389
I feel like all he needed
was a gentle nudge.

16:19.414 --> 16:22.082
Aw, well, he's been going
on and on about you, Esther.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.641
You will have to come
and babysit for us.

16:23.666 --> 16:25.076
Oh, my God, I would love that so much.

16:25.101 --> 16:26.733
I mean, please call my office.

16:26.758 --> 16:30.121
- We will get that scheduled.
- Okay. We will do that.

16:30.146 --> 16:31.676
And I love this dress.
Is that designer?

16:31.701 --> 16:34.468
You know, everything
is designed by someone.

16:34.930 --> 16:37.593
Okay. All right, you two have fun.

16:38.086 --> 16:40.586
Oh, my God, phase one of
my plan actually worked.

16:40.611 --> 16:42.411
Thank you. Next target,

16:42.436 --> 16:44.536
every single kid at this bar mitzvah.

16:44.561 --> 16:45.760
Get it, girl.

16:45.848 --> 16:47.358
Yes!

16:47.625 --> 16:49.032
Oh, I'll take that.

16:50.934 --> 16:53.486
So our little rock star Parker

16:53.511 --> 16:56.816
has something very special
that he would like to show you.

16:56.841 --> 16:59.691
I would like to single out
my nephew Benji,

16:59.716 --> 17:03.236
because he helped Parker,
and made all of this possible.

17:05.221 --> 17:07.669
All right. Okay.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.461
Thanks, everybody,
but I could not have done it

17:10.486 --> 17:12.353
without my friend Esther,

17:12.428 --> 17:14.395
who is so responsible.

17:15.244 --> 17:17.846
Always insists on using a pool cover.

17:18.894 --> 17:21.125
That's right. You guys are too kind.

17:21.297 --> 17:23.297
Thank you so much.
I accept your praise.

17:23.339 --> 17:24.606
Thank you.

17:26.376 --> 17:27.508
Okay.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.697
All right.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.737
What is this? He changed the song.

17:36.762 --> 17:39.162
It's no Gaga, but it's still good.

17:39.415 --> 17:42.116
And the suspenders still play.

17:42.712 --> 17:45.202
Such an idiot for thinking
I could revive ska music.

17:45.273 --> 17:47.068
Probably just gotta wait
until gas prices go down,

17:47.093 --> 17:48.723
and then seven-person
bands can tour again.

17:48.748 --> 17:52.000
I'm sorry, but hey, at least
you can be happy for me.

17:52.328 --> 17:54.462
I'm gonna be rich.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.383
You were saying?

18:12.408 --> 18:15.695
Oh, my God, your cousin
is a sex-crazed little freak.

18:15.793 --> 18:18.760
I saw her dancing earlier. I
thought she was in Parker's class.

18:18.795 --> 18:21.920
Of course our cousin Benji would
end up on the road to porn.

18:29.070 --> 18:30.331
He's a 13-year-old boy.

18:30.356 --> 18:31.915
If they don't vent
their sexual frustrations,

18:31.940 --> 18:33.833
they kill little animals.
This is kind of a winner.

18:33.924 --> 18:37.130
Are you crazy? Bubbe is going
to have a heart attack?

18:37.306 --> 18:38.748
It's fine. Chill, all right?

18:38.802 --> 18:40.069
You're gonna have to figure
out a new way to get

18:40.094 --> 18:42.101
those Rhianna tickets.

18:42.986 --> 18:44.755
Okay, yes, I am sexy,

18:44.847 --> 18:47.782
but sexy and responsible
can go together.

18:47.857 --> 18:49.711
No, they cannot, and you need to go.

18:49.736 --> 18:52.389
But think of UNICEF
ambassador Angelina Jolie.

18:52.414 --> 18:53.581
I'm like her.

18:53.683 --> 18:55.534
I'm pretty and responsible.

18:55.766 --> 18:57.899
Oh, grab that.

18:58.941 --> 19:00.211
I'm a babysitter.

19:00.236 --> 19:03.504
<i>Hey, Esther, it's Parker... send nudes.</i>

19:03.736 --> 19:06.356
I did it, I'm a dancing waitress.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.931
Congrats! You really gotta
have game to work there.

19:09.956 --> 19:12.379
I know. And you know what,
I takes people years

19:12.404 --> 19:14.427
to get to where I am,
and all I had to do was

19:14.452 --> 19:16.406
show that manager that I was serious,

19:16.431 --> 19:20.311
laser-focused, and that she could
never, ever-ever escape me.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.013
Okay, so you're like the lower back

19:22.038 --> 19:23.124
tattoo of the service industry.

19:23.149 --> 19:26.239
I'm whatever it takes dude,
all things to Ethel.

19:26.443 --> 19:28.277
Will you say 'hi' to Tupac for me?

19:29.305 --> 19:35.190
