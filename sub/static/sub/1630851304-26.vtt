WEBVTT

00:01.275 --> 00:05.310
PREVIOUSLY ON BIG BROTHER!

00:05.344 --> 00:08.448
THE WELL HIDDEN COOKOUT BUT
USE THE MOST POWERFUL ALLIANCE

00:08.482 --> 00:11.034
IN THE HOUSE.

00:11.068 --> 00:14.586
AND EACH MEMBER HAD A CLUELESS
PARTNER TO GET THEM FURTHER IN

00:14.620 --> 00:15.862
THE GAME.

00:15.896 --> 00:18.620
IF ONE OF THE DUOS ENDS UP ON
THE BLOCK TOGETHER THE COOKOUT

00:18.655 --> 00:20.896
THAT NUMBERS TO HELP THEM STAY
SAFE.

00:20.931 --> 00:22.896
TIFFANY WAS THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

00:22.931 --> 00:28.689
I AM --
BUT AFTER HER PERSONAL PAWN

00:28.724 --> 00:30.413
WON THE POWERFUL COIN OF
DESTINY.

00:30.448 --> 00:34.586
WE HAVE A 50 PERCENT CHANCE
RIGHT NOW OF BEENING THE NEW

00:34.620 --> 00:35.034
HOH.

00:35.068 --> 00:36.068
ANONYMOUSLY.

00:36.103 --> 00:39.655
A FATEFUL FLIP MAY CLEAR THE
NEW SECRET HOH.

00:39.689 --> 00:41.517
I AM IN DEEP TROUBLE.

00:41.551 --> 00:45.172
AND CLAIRE DECIDED TO KEEP
TIFFANY'S NOMINEES IN PLACE.

00:45.206 --> 00:53.655
I WANT ONE OF KYLAND, SARAH
BETH OR EVEN XAVIER TO LEAVE THE

00:53.689 --> 00:54.965
WEEK.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.551
AFTER HANNAH WON THE VETO --
HANNAH, CONGRATULATIONS, YOU

00:57.586 --> 01:00.103
WON THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO!

01:00.137 --> 01:03.310
SHE SAVED XAVIER, WHO WAS A
SPECIAL THIRD NOMINEE.

01:03.344 --> 01:09.241
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON XAVIER.

01:09.275 --> 01:13.586
LEAVING KYLAND AND HIS
NONCOOKOUT BESTIE ON THE BLOCK.

01:13.620 --> 01:18.586
IT IS NEVER GREAT TO SIT ON
THE BLOCK ON EVICTION NIGHT BUT

01:18.620 --> 01:21.068
I DO BELIEVE THIS IS THE THE
BEST PLAN.

01:21.103 --> 01:28.551
PLAYING FOR THE END GAME
XAVIER, KI AND.

01:28.586 --> 01:31.793
I AM NOT TRYING TO UTTER YOUR
NAMES IN YOUR MOUTH.

01:31.827 --> 01:36.034
THE THREE GUYS ARE LOOKING
OUT EACH OTHER MAKES SENSE TO

01:36.068 --> 01:37.241
ME.

01:37.275 --> 01:40.482
BUT HE WAS ALSO TRYING TO
LOCK IN KYLAND FOR A FINAL TWO

01:40.517 --> 01:41.655
DEAL.

01:41.689 --> 01:47.000
WE CAN TAKE IT TO --
YET TIFFANY HAD OTHER PLANS.

01:47.034 --> 01:51.965
KYLE WANTS TO TAKE -- I WANT
TO FOR SURE TAKE --

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
AT THE LIVE CONVENTION --
I HAVE A VOTE OF 5-1, SARAH

01:59.034 --> 02:01.482
BETH, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM THE
BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

02:01.517 --> 02:08.724
THE COOKOUTS SEND ANOTHER
UNSUSPECTING SUCKER TO THE JURY.

02:08.758 --> 02:14.000
WITH THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD
BACK UP FOR GRABS UNDER THE BIG

02:14.034 --> 02:15.206
TOP, CLAIRE KNEW SHE COULDN'T
WIN.

02:15.241 --> 02:20.448
TO KEEP THIS WEEK'S SECRET
HOH A SECRET, HE OR SHE MUST

02:20.482 --> 02:21.793
GROW THIS COMPETITION.

02:21.827 --> 02:26.448
BUT EVERYONE ELSE WAS HOLDING
ON FOR DEAR LIFE.

02:26.482 --> 02:29.655
TONIGHT, WHO WILL BE THE
RINGMASTER OF THE CIRCUS FOR

02:29.689 --> 02:30.551
POWER?

02:30.586 --> 02:33.379
AND WHO WILL BE NOMINATED FOR
EVICTION?

02:33.413 --> 02:37.000
PLUS, THE COOKOUT HAS MADE IT
TO THE FINAL EIGHT, BUT WILL

02:37.034 --> 02:41.206
THEY FINISH THEIR MISSION BEFORE
THEY TURN ON EACH OTHER?

02:41.241 --> 02:44.413
SHE WILL TAKE THAT SHOT AT US
AND TAKE US OUT.

02:44.448 --> 02:49.310
OH, THIS WEEK FULLY I AM
BRINGING OUT MY SAVAGE SIDE.

02:49.344 --> 02:53.620
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON BIG
BROTHER!

02:53.655 --> 02:59.034
OH, MY GOD, IT IS IT IS
BURNING, OH, MY GOD, GIVE ME A

02:59.068 --> 02:59.620
FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

03:37.758 --> 03:42.758
YOU ALL KNOW THAT THE FIRST
THREE HOUSE GUESTS TO FALL WILL

03:42.793 --> 03:45.620
BE HAVE NOTES FOR THE WEEK.

03:45.655 --> 03:46.172
HI, JULIE.

03:46.206 --> 03:56.413
GOOD NIGHT, JULIE.

03:56.448 --> 03:59.000
OH, THEY HAVE BUBBLES IN THE
BOOTY.

03:59.034 --> 04:01.896
OH!

04:01.931 --> 04:05.206
I AM OUTGOING HOH AND IT WAS
PERFECT.

04:05.241 --> 04:09.586
I GOT THE TARGET OUT, SARAH
BETH, BUT BECAUSE I WON THE COIN

04:09.620 --> 04:13.517
OF DESTINY LAST WEEK AND I WAS
THE SECRET HOH, I CAN'T BE THE

04:13.551 --> 04:17.896
HOH AGAIN, SO I HAVE TO THROW
THIS.

04:17.931 --> 04:19.137
BUBBLES.

04:19.172 --> 04:20.448
UH OH.

04:20.482 --> 04:26.241
IT WAS EXTREMELY TOUGH TO SEE
MY FRIEND SARAH BETH WEEP.

04:26.275 --> 04:29.689
I UNDERSTAND IT WAS IN THE
SERVICE OF THE MISSION OF THE

04:29.724 --> 04:32.931
SIX, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT LESS
DIFFICULT.

04:32.965 --> 04:35.655
AS LONG AS WE CAN CARRY TOUT
NEXT STEPS IN OUR PLAN AND MOVE

04:35.689 --> 04:40.137
THE SIX FORWARD, IT HELPS MAKE
MY OWN SACRIFICES ALL A LITTLE

04:40.172 --> 04:44.448
BIT MORE WORTH IT.

04:44.482 --> 04:47.655
I FINALLY GOT SARAH BETH OUT

04:47.689 --> 04:49.241
OF THIS HOUSE.

04:49.275 --> 04:53.620
WHAT A SWEET, SWEET REVENGE.

04:53.655 --> 04:56.448
GREAT FOR THE COOKOUT AND BETTER
WEEK FOR ME.

04:56.482 --> 05:02.482
I ALWAYS GET WHAT I WANT.

05:02.517 --> 05:06.137
YOU GOT IT, BIG Z.

05:06.172 --> 05:11.275
YOU GOT IT, YOU ARE GOOD.

05:11.310 --> 05:14.034
THAT'S OKAY, BIG D.

05:14.068 --> 05:14.896
BIG D.

05:14.931 --> 05:16.000
COME ON.

05:16.034 --> 05:20.344
GOOD JOB, DEAR.

05:20.379 --> 05:24.482
BYE BUBBLES.

05:24.517 --> 05:28.000
DAMN!

05:28.034 --> 05:28.793
REALLY SWEET.

05:28.827 --> 05:31.551
COME ON OVER HERE, BUBBLES.

05:31.586 --> 05:36.172
I REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS HOH
BECAUSE I WANT TO PRO BELL THE

05:36.206 --> 05:41.517
SIX FORWARD, PUT US IN THE BEST
POSITION TO GET US TO THE FINAL

05:41.551 --> 05:42.448
SIX.

05:42.482 --> 05:44.034
IT IS REALLY HONESTLY NOT ABOUT
THE POWER.

05:44.068 --> 05:46.068
THIS WOULD MEAN A LOT FOR ME.

05:46.103 --> 05:47.137
SWING A LITTLE BIT FASTER.

05:47.172 --> 05:50.034
I AM DEFINITELY GOING TO
PUKE, GUYS.

05:50.068 --> 05:50.965
YOU ARE GOING TO PUKE?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.172
YEAH.

05:52.206 --> 05:55.137
I REALLY WANT TO WIN THIS HOH
COMPETITION BUT EVERY SINGLE

05:55.172 --> 05:58.448
TIME I AM HITTING THIS ELEPHANT
I AM GETTING DIZZIER AND DIZZIER

05:58.482 --> 06:00.344
AND SPINNING FASTER AND FASTER.

06:00.379 --> 06:05.310
I AM HONESTLY EVEN SURE HOW MUCH
LONGER I CAN HANG ON.

06:05.344 --> 06:11.689
STAY STRONG.

06:11.724 --> 06:16.034
ALYSSA, YOU HAVE BEEN

06:16.068 --> 06:17.896
ELIMINATED, THAT MEANS YOU WILL
BE A HAVE-NOT THIS WEEK.

06:17.931 --> 06:21.620
I AM VERY EMBARRASSED WITH MY
PERFORMANCE.

06:21.655 --> 06:22.448
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.586
THE DIZZINESS JUST REALLY GOT TO
ME.

06:24.620 --> 06:28.275
NOW THAT I AM OUT OF THE RUNNING
FOR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD I AM JUST

06:28.310 --> 06:30.551
HOPING, HOPING, HOPING THAT
XAVIER CAN WIN THIS.

06:30.586 --> 06:32.206
THAT WAY WE CAN BE SAFE.

06:32.241 --> 06:35.689
I JUST REALLY, REALLY HOPE
XAVIER WINS.

06:35.724 --> 06:37.517
GOOD JOB.

06:37.551 --> 06:40.379
ALYSSA IS OUT SECOND.

06:40.413 --> 06:42.827
I DEFINITELY THOUGHT ALYSSA
WOULD BE THE ONE TO BEAT.

06:42.862 --> 06:44.965
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.862
NOW THERE IS NO CHANCE OF ALYSSA
WINNING THIS COMPETITION.

06:49.896 --> 06:51.689
HA, HA, HA.

06:51.724 --> 06:55.896
OH, NO.

06:55.931 --> 06:59.000
THIS COMPETITION IS
DEFINITELY NOT FUN.

06:59.034 --> 07:05.551
THERE ARE THESE THREE WEIRDLY
DRESSED CIRCUS PEOPLE WHO ARE

07:05.586 --> 07:09.448
JUST BORED AND LIKE SPRAYING
EVERYBODY WITH WATER.

07:09.482 --> 07:17.172
AFTER LIVING THROUGH
FRENCHY'S HOH REIGN I ALREADY

07:17.206 --> 07:20.758
SURVIVED THE CIRCUS, I DON'T
NEED TO SURVIVE ANYMORE WHILE I

07:20.793 --> 07:21.448
AM IN THIS HOUSE.

07:21.482 --> 07:29.689
WE HAVE THIS BABY STATION.

07:29.724 --> 07:32.482
OH.

07:32.517 --> 07:38.965
DAMN, MR. ELEPHANT.

07:39.000 --> 07:47.689
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE HAVE
ALREADY DROPPED, SO NOW IT IS A

07:47.724 --> 07:49.965
PRETTY GOOD TIME TO THROW THIS
THING.

07:50.000 --> 07:50.655
GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE.

07:50.689 --> 07:56.448
HAVE FUN UP HERE.

07:56.482 --> 07:59.482
OH, CLAIRE, ARE YOU OKAY?

07:59.517 --> 08:01.206
CLAIRE, YOU HAVE BEEN
ELIMINATED.

08:01.241 --> 08:05.758
THAT MEANS YOU WILL BE A
HAVE-NOT THIS WEEK.

08:05.793 --> 08:07.137
STAY WITH IT, GUYS.

08:07.172 --> 08:10.965
IT IS NOW DOWN TO JUST
COOKOUT MEMBERS WHICH IS GREAT

08:11.000 --> 08:13.379
BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE AGREED
UPON A PLAN FOR HOW WE ARE GOING

08:13.413 --> 08:16.172
PROCEED THIS WEEK.

08:16.206 --> 08:22.586
WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT ON
CLAIRE BEING THE TARGET FOR NEXT

08:22.620 --> 08:22.896
WEEK?

08:22.931 --> 08:23.896
YEAH.

08:23.931 --> 08:28.482
CLAIRE SIGNED ONE PIECES OF
-- SHE GO FIRST.

08:28.517 --> 08:39.586
I AM STILL PLANNING FOR GOING
ON HOH, BUT KYLAND -- HOH --

08:39.620 --> 08:48.413
YOU KNOW, CLAIRE --
WHISPERING]

08:48.448 --> 08:52.206
TIFFANY AND XAVIER ARE THE
LAST TWO PEOPLE IN THE COOKOUT

08:52.241 --> 08:54.275
WITH THEIR PLUS ONE STILL IN THE
GAME.

08:54.310 --> 08:58.862
WE STILL NEED GET OUT ALYSSA AND
CLAIRE IN ORDER TO GET ALL OF US

08:58.896 --> 09:02.068
MEMBERS IN THE COOKOUT IN THE
FINAL SIX.

09:02.103 --> 09:06.310
THE BIG TEAM, BIG D OR I CAN
JUST -- AND I DON'T MIND EITHER

09:06.344 --> 09:07.551
WAY.

09:07.586 --> 09:11.275
AS LONG AS ALYSSA IS OUT
THERE THEN NONE OF US SHOULD BE

09:11.310 --> 09:11.758
THROWING ANYTHING.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.586
YES.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.482
AND OBVIOUSLY --
I WOULD LOVE TO GET A THIRD

09:17.517 --> 09:20.758
HOH WIN, PLUS I HAVE PRETTY
LEGITIMATE REASONS TO GO AFTER

09:20.793 --> 09:25.965
BOTH CLAIRE AND ALYSSA, SO IF I
SENT EITHER OF THEM HOME IT

09:26.000 --> 09:27.724
WOULDN'T RAISE FLAGS FOR ANYONE.

09:27.758 --> 09:29.448
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME WINNING
NEXT WEEK.

09:29.482 --> 09:33.310
HUH-UH.

09:33.344 --> 09:46.241
THIS WEEK --
TAKE OUT CLAIRE --

09:46.275 --> 09:50.206
THE COOKOUT REALLY WANTS
CLAIRE 0 GONE THIS WEEK,

09:50.241 --> 09:54.137
HOWEVER, I AM GOOD FOR ALYSSA TO
GO THIS WEEK BECAUSE ALYSSA IS A

09:54.172 --> 09:58.724
TOUGH COMPETITOR TO BEAT AND IF
SHE WINS, WE STILL HAVE SEVEN

09:58.758 --> 10:02.379
PEOPLE LEFT, SHE CAN SEND HOME
ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE

10:02.413 --> 10:06.034
COOKOUT, AND I DON'T WANT THAT
TO BE ME.

10:06.068 --> 10:12.206
SO THE COOKOUT, CLAIRE, I WANT
ALYSSA, HEY, WE WILL SEE WHAT

10:12.241 --> 10:13.241
HAPPENS.

10:13.275 --> 10:19.000
COME ON, X.

10:19.034 --> 10:23.103
HERE I AM, THERE ARE ONLY TWO
OPTIONS TO SEND HOME THIS WEEK,

10:23.137 --> 10:24.206
ALYSSA AND CLAIRE.

10:24.241 --> 10:28.241
WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE
WHEN THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER

10:28.275 --> 10:29.655
PEOPLE WHO CAN DO IT FOR ME?

10:29.689 --> 10:30.413
HERE YOU GO, HANNAH.

10:30.448 --> 10:33.896
I AM A-OK WITH LOSING.

10:33.931 --> 10:38.000
OH, GOOD JOB, HANNAH.

10:38.034 --> 10:39.413
WHOA.

10:39.448 --> 10:41.896
THAT'S OKAY.

10:41.931 --> 10:43.241
COME ON.

10:43.275 --> 10:44.758
COME ON, KY.

10:44.793 --> 10:46.034
COME ON.

10:46.068 --> 10:51.206
IT IS NOW DOWN TO MYSELF, SKY
LAND, AZAH, AZAH AND SKY LAND

10:51.241 --> 10:54.689
ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO TAKE
A SHOT AT CLAIRE ..

10:54.724 --> 10:57.689
YET AGAIN I WILL BE THROWING
ANOTHER COMPETITION.

10:57.724 --> 11:02.931
PEACE OUT, BB CIRCUS.

11:02.965 --> 11:05.068
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

11:05.103 --> 11:18.034
NICE JOB, THOUGH.

11:18.068 --> 11:21.689
I STARTED TO NOTICE THAT MY TOES
START SLIPPING AND IT IS GETTING

11:21.724 --> 11:23.620
HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER.

11:23.655 --> 11:26.034
WAIT FOR IT, AZAH.

11:26.068 --> 11:27.275
HOLD ON.

11:27.310 --> 11:31.137
I AM DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO SCRAMBLE MY FEET BACK ON TO

11:31.172 --> 11:33.620
THIS DISK BUT IT IS SLOWLY
SLIPPING AWAY.

11:33.655 --> 11:37.241
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I
HAVE.

11:37.275 --> 11:40.620
DON'T LAUNCH, BABY.

11:40.655 --> 11:41.379
COME ON.

11:41.413 --> 11:42.344
AZAH.

11:42.379 --> 11:45.241
I AM DISAPPOINTED AT THE END
OF THE DAY.

11:45.275 --> 11:46.000
I DID MY BEST.

11:46.034 --> 11:48.137
KILLED IT, AZAH.

11:48.172 --> 11:50.793
YOU DID REALLY WEZ, AZ.

11:50.827 --> 11:52.034
THANK YOU.

11:52.068 --> 11:55.206
BUT I JUST WANT TO SEE MY
PARENTS AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO,

11:55.241 --> 11:56.655
SO THAT'S WHY I AM SAD.

11:56.689 --> 12:00.551
ARE YOU OKAY, AZAH?

12:00.586 --> 12:01.275
YES.

12:01.310 --> 12:07.275
I AM JUST REALLY NAUSEOUS.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.034
I WANT TO WIN THIS.

12:10.068 --> 12:14.068
KYLAND COULD BE COMING FOR
REVENGE FOR SARAH BETH IN WHICH

12:14.103 --> 12:16.724
CASE HE WOULD GO AFTER TIFFANY
AND MYSELF.

12:16.758 --> 12:18.206
COME ON, HOLD THIS OUT.

12:18.241 --> 12:20.068
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

12:20.103 --> 12:23.620
DIG DEEP.

12:23.655 --> 12:27.724
AT THIS .2 DOWN TO ME AND

12:27.758 --> 12:31.586
TIF, WE ALL KNOW THE PLAN IS IS
FOR TIFFANY NOT TO WIN THIS WEEK

12:31.620 --> 12:32.413
SO WE CAN GO AFTER CLAIRE.

12:32.448 --> 12:34.000
I LOOK AT TIF.

12:34.034 --> 12:39.793
SHE IS STILL ROCK STEADY AND
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IS UP.

12:39.827 --> 12:45.896
THE WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, IF
TIF.

12:45.931 --> 12:46.689
TIF, JUST DROP.

13:08.620 --> 13:11.034
SO NOW IT IS ON ME AND TIF
AND THE LAST ONE STANDING IS THE

13:11.068 --> 13:12.310
NEXT HOH.

13:12.344 --> 13:14.827
TIF IS SUPPOSED TO THROW THIS
ONE SO WE CAN TARGET CLAIRE THIS

13:14.862 --> 13:17.689
WEEK BY IT SEEMS LIKE HER PLANS
HAVE CHANGED.

13:17.724 --> 13:25.413
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW.

13:25.448 --> 13:27.862
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE, GUYS?

13:27.896 --> 13:32.620
OKAY, WE ALL DEFINITELY AGREED
ON THIS, ON WHO WOULD DROP.

13:32.655 --> 13:34.379
TIFFANY WAS DEFINITELY SUPPOSED
TO DROP.

13:34.413 --> 13:39.241
WE HAVE ALL PUT OUR INDIVIDUAL
GAME ASIDE AND TIME AND TIME

13:39.275 --> 13:42.586
AGAIN IF WE ARE AT THE POINT OF
MAKING SURE ALL OF US GET TO

13:42.620 --> 13:58.586
SIX, THEN WE ALL NEED TO WORK
TOGETHER AND DO OUR OWN PART.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.379
LOOKING GOOD, GUYS, KEEP IT
UP.

14:01.413 --> 14:05.620
I THOUGHT WE ALREADY HAD A PLAN
BUT TIFFANY IS STILL UP THERE

14:05.655 --> 14:11.620
SPINNING AROUND AND AROUND AND
AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND AND

14:11.655 --> 14:12.724
AROUND.

14:12.758 --> 14:18.379
AND I AM CONFUSED ON WHY WE ARE
STILL SITTING HERE.

14:18.413 --> 14:23.724
KEEP IT GOING, KY.

14:23.758 --> 14:26.620
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IF THE ANY
DOING AT THIS POINT BUT IT IS

14:26.655 --> 14:30.586
RAISING SOME RED FLAGS AND THERE
IS, IT IS DEFINITELY KIND OF

14:30.620 --> 14:36.034
MAKING ME QUESTION WHERE HER
TRUE LOYALTY LIES, TO THE COOK

14:36.068 --> 14:42.482
CANOUT OR SOLELY TO HERSELF.

14:42.517 --> 14:50.586
YEAH.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.896
-- I KNOW YOU WANT KNOW DROP,
KY.

14:53.931 --> 14:57.862
I KNOW YOU WANT TO RACK UP AS
MANY WINS AS YOU CAN FOR YOUR

14:57.896 --> 15:01.724
RESUME, BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS GET
WHAT WE WANT NOW, DO WE?

15:01.758 --> 15:05.241
ARE YOU GUYS ABLE TO GIVE US
A MINUTE?

15:05.275 --> 15:08.172
HE KIND OF WANTS TO MAKE A
DEAL.

15:08.206 --> 15:12.793
HEY, I HAVEN'T TOUCHED THE BLOCK
AND I AM NOT TOUCHING THE BLOCK

15:12.827 --> 15:13.793
IF I DON'T HAVE TO.

15:13.827 --> 15:15.896
STILL ON THE BLOCK WHEN I COULD
BE HOH?

15:15.931 --> 15:17.724
WHAT HOH?

15:17.758 --> 15:21.896
WHAT HOH, HA, I WILL BE HOH, I
WILL BE HERE FOR A MINUTE, KY,

15:21.931 --> 15:24.862
YOU KEEP SWINGING AND I WILL
KEEP HOLDING.

15:24.896 --> 15:30.620
COME ON, KY.

15:30.655 --> 15:46.931
I BROKE LUNCH.

15:48.793 --> 15:55.586
I AM GREAT NOW.

15:55.620 --> 15:59.413
TIF DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SHE IS
GETTING READY TO THROW THIS AND

15:59.448 --> 16:02.137
I AM JUST LIKE, WHY NOT?

16:02.172 --> 16:05.586
THE CHALLENGE WITH TIFFANY
WINNING THIS WEEK IS SHE COULD

16:05.620 --> 16:09.034
BE PUT IN A SITUATION WHERE SHE
HAS TO PUT UP CLAIRE AND THAT

16:09.068 --> 16:10.620
WOULD BE REALLY BAD FOR HER.

16:10.655 --> 16:13.896
TIF, WHAT IS GOING ON?

16:13.931 --> 16:16.965
I WANT TO WIN.

16:17.000 --> 16:26.620
I WOULDN'T BE UP HERE.

16:26.655 --> 16:29.724
AH.

16:29.758 --> 16:30.620
GOOD JOB.

16:30.655 --> 16:33.137
NICE JOB, TIF 2, WEEKS IN A ROW.

16:33.172 --> 16:38.310
GOOD JOB, TIFFANY.

16:38.344 --> 16:41.103
HEY, I DID IT AGAIN, YOU ALL.

16:41.137 --> 16:43.034
I AM SO TREEING EXCITED.

16:43.068 --> 16:55.034
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN --
DON'T GIVE ME NO CHANCES.

16:55.068 --> 16:57.862
YOU GIVE MAY CHANCE AND I WILL
TAKE IT.

16:57.896 --> 16:59.034
I WILL TAKE IT.

16:59.068 --> 17:02.655
CONGRATULATIONS, TIFFANY, YOU
ARE NOW THE NEW HEAD OF

17:02.689 --> 17:05.068
HOUSEHOLD.

17:05.103 --> 17:07.931
THANK YOU.

17:07.965 --> 17:09.206
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:09.241 --> 17:12.896
YOU ALL WENT INTO THIS HOH
COMPETITION WITH A SPECIFIC SET

17:12.931 --> 17:16.068
PLAN IN MIND, AGREED UPON BY
EVERYONE AND AT TIMES IT FEELS

17:16.103 --> 17:19.379
LIKE SHE WENT ROGUE AND SINCE IT
WAS DOWN TO ME AND HER I JUST

17:19.413 --> 17:20.655
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.724
THAT WASN'T VERY --
THE COOKOUT IS WORKING TO

17:33.758 --> 17:37.448
ACCOMPLISH A GOAL BUT THERE CAN
ONLY BE ONE WINNER.

17:37.482 --> 17:39.172
I AM TRYING TO BUILD MY RESUME.

17:39.206 --> 17:46.103
I HAVE GOT ONE WILDCARD, NOW I
HAVE A BACK-TO-BACK HOH AND I AM

17:46.137 --> 17:48.551
-- I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
INTENTION OF SITTING ON THE

17:48.586 --> 17:49.862
BLOCK.

17:49.896 --> 17:53.310
ALL OF THIS ALLOWS ME TO HAVE A
NICE FULL RESUME TO HELP ENSURE

17:53.344 --> 18:01.034
I AM THE WINNER.

18:01.068 --> 18:02.689
I AM IRRITATED.

18:02.724 --> 18:07.413
TIFFANY IN HOH THIS WEEK CREATES
UNNECESSARY RISK.

18:07.448 --> 18:10.689
IN ORDER FOR THE STICKS SIX TO
MOVE TO THE END OF THIS GAME

18:10.724 --> 18:14.724
THERE ARE VERY FEW OPTION FOR
WHO CAN GO HOME THIS WEEK.

18:14.758 --> 18:19.310
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
SHE WOULD MAKE THAT SORT OF

18:19.344 --> 18:25.137
SELFISH AND RISKY DECISION.

18:25.172 --> 18:32.827
IT IS KIND OF AWKWARD.

18:38.931 --> 18:43.586
I AM HAPPY I AM SAFE IN WEEK BUT
CLAIRE WAS THE AGREED UPON

18:43.620 --> 18:44.551
TARGET.

18:44.586 --> 18:48.241
NOW THAT TIFFANY IS HOH, IS SHE
GOING ROGUE?

18:48.275 --> 18:49.206
PROBABLY NOT.

18:49.241 --> 18:59.206
WE NEED TO PUT OUR PERSONAL GAME
ASIDE BUT --

19:20.103 --> 19:23.827
I CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN.

19:23.862 --> 19:30.965
I AM JUST SO OVER IT, DUDE.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.172
IT IS NOT FUN ANYMORE.

19:32.206 --> 19:35.448
I CAN'T DO THE FAKENESS AND THE
TALKS AND THE ONE ON ONES.

19:35.482 --> 19:41.551
IT IS JUST SO FAKE, IT IS NOT
REAL.

19:41.586 --> 19:47.034
NOT BEING HOH YET AGAIN,
DEFINITELY SUCKS, BEING A

19:47.068 --> 19:50.137
HAVE-NOT FOR THE THIRD TIME,
THAT DEFINITELY SUCKS.

19:50.172 --> 19:54.448
TIFFANY WINNING IS ALSO VERY
SCARY BECAUSE I DEFINITELY KNOW

19:54.482 --> 19:56.379
I AM NOT ONE OF HER CLOSEST
ALLIES.

19:56.413 --> 19:59.517
I DO NOT WANT HER GOING AFTER X
OR MYSELF.

19:59.551 --> 20:04.172
I THINK WE HAVE TO WORRY AND
EVERY WEEK I AM JUST STRESSED.

20:04.206 --> 20:06.275
YOU CAN'T LET THIS GAME BEAT
YOU.

20:06.310 --> 20:10.620
I AM JUST SO --
I AM PISSED BECAUSE PEOPLE

20:10.655 --> 20:13.517
DECIDED TO PLAY SELFISHLY AND IT
WAS IMPORTANT THAT TIFFANY NOT

20:13.551 --> 20:16.931
WIN THIS HOH BECAUSE THE TARGET
OF THIS WEEK WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

20:16.965 --> 20:21.482
CLAIRE, BUT TIFFANY CAN TARGET
ALYSSA, AND WHO IS ALYSSA'S

20:21.517 --> 20:22.758
PERSON?

20:22.793 --> 20:25.517
THIS GUY, SO WHO WILL LIKELY SEE
THE BLOCK AGAIN FOR THE THIRD

20:25.551 --> 20:26.137
WEEK IN A ROW?

20:26.172 --> 20:26.862
THIS GUY?

20:26.896 --> 20:31.827
AND HOW DOES HE FEEL ABOUT THAT?

20:31.862 --> 20:33.551
FREAKING LIVID!

20:33.586 --> 20:41.482
THEY ARE PISSED.

20:59.103 --> 21:04.620
THEY ARE SO MAD.

21:04.655 --> 21:05.862
TIFF IS AMAZING.

21:05.896 --> 21:09.310
I DON'T NEED A MAN IN THIS HOUSE
BECAUSE I HAVE TIFF.

21:09.344 --> 21:10.620
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:10.655 --> 21:15.275
I COULDN'T WIN THIS HOH BECAUSE
I WAS THE SECRET HOH LAST WEEK,

21:15.310 --> 21:19.310
I AM SO STOKED BECAUSE I AM
DEFINITELY GOING TO FINAL SEVEN.

21:19.344 --> 21:21.517
I DON'T THINK THEY WILL BLIND
SIDE ME THIS WEEK.

21:21.551 --> 21:25.344
THIS IS MY BEST-CASE SCENARIO.

21:25.379 --> 21:31.896
THIS DUO IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

21:31.931 --> 21:47.965
OH, THEY ARE GOING TO BE

21:49.862 --> 21:51.620
COMING FOR US FOR SURE NEXT
WEEK.

21:51.655 --> 21:56.793
OH, MY GOD, CLAIRE.

21:56.827 --> 22:03.448
HEY, MISS.

22:03.482 --> 22:03.862
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

22:03.896 --> 22:05.172
I AM OKAY.

22:05.206 --> 22:05.586
HOW ARE YOU?

22:05.620 --> 22:09.689
I AM GOOD.

22:09.724 --> 22:11.827
JUST FILL ME IN.

22:11.862 --> 22:16.482
THAT'S ALL I AM SAYING.

22:16.517 --> 22:18.482
BECAUSE FIVE MINUTES EARLIER --
THAT'S FINE.

22:18.517 --> 22:21.517
LIKE I HAVE ALREADY SHOWED YOU I
AM ALWAYS WITH YOU.

22:21.551 --> 22:22.827
I CAN SAY WHAT IS UP?

22:22.862 --> 22:28.379
WHAT IS UP AND YET -- I DIDN'T
HEAR YOU SAY -- IT IS LIKE I AM

22:28.413 --> 22:28.965
ASKING, WHAT IS GOING ON?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.862
WHAT IS GOING ON?

22:30.896 --> 22:35.000
TIFFANY WINNING DOES IMPACT HOW
I VIEW HER TO WIN YOU KNOW, TWO

22:35.034 --> 22:39.793
HOH BACK-TO-BACK, THE WAY THAT
IT HAPPENED AND THE TIME THAT IT

22:39.827 --> 22:43.344
HAPPENED MAKES IT HARD TO TRUST
THAT SHE IS THE TEAM PLAYER THAT

22:43.379 --> 22:46.310
I NEED HER TO BE.

22:46.344 --> 22:51.620
NOW YOU HAVE GOT A MENTAL AND
A PHYSICAL -- THAT YOU WON.

22:51.655 --> 23:02.034
THAT IS A BIG DEAL.

23:02.068 --> 23:03.758
THEY ARE ALL MAD.

23:03.793 --> 23:08.206
THEY ARE ALL SAD AND MONEY-Y.

23:08.241 --> 23:13.689
I MEAN, MOPE-Y, SOMEBODY HAD TO
WIN.

23:13.724 --> 23:16.896
BUT GUESS WHAT?

23:16.931 --> 23:20.827
AND .. I CAME UP WITH A MASTER
PLAN AND THEREFORE I SHOULD BE

23:20.862 --> 23:25.068
ABLE TO KEEP IT SO IF IT ALL
GOES TO PLAN AND ALYSSA DOESN'T

23:25.103 --> 23:30.689
WIN THE POWER OF VETO, CLAIRE
WILL BE HERE ONE MORE WEEK.

23:30.724 --> 23:34.379
THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE TO LET
HER -- I AM NOT GOING TO LET

23:34.413 --> 23:35.344
THAT HAPPEN.

23:35.379 --> 23:41.517
AND GUESS WHAT?

23:41.551 --> 23:50.793
OKAY.

23:50.827 --> 23:53.172
I AM SORRY.

23:53.206 --> 23:55.103
I CANNOT DO THIS ANYMORE.

23:55.137 --> 23:57.482
I AM SO OVER HER NOW.

23:57.517 --> 24:03.068
MY CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN
SHATTERED AND PLUS I WENT OUT

24:03.103 --> 24:04.344
FIRST.

24:04.379 --> 24:08.034
I AM SO TIRED OF FEELING LIKE I
AM THE WEAKEST PERSON IN THIS

24:08.068 --> 24:08.758
GAME.

24:08.793 --> 24:09.586
I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE.

24:09.620 --> 24:11.482
I DON'T.

24:11.517 --> 24:15.758
THIS IS WHY I AM CALLING THIS
-- LISTEN TO ME, WILL ON THE ME.

24:15.793 --> 24:19.448
LOOK AT ME, PLEASE.

24:19.482 --> 24:24.344
YOU CAME IN HERE, YOU CREATE AN
ALLIANCE AND THAT RIGHT NOW IS

24:24.379 --> 24:31.862
MAKING HISTORY.

24:31.896 --> 24:33.413
I GET THAT, AZAH.

24:33.448 --> 24:34.793
I GET THAT.

24:34.827 --> 24:36.413
I AM RESPECTING THAT.

24:36.448 --> 24:41.482
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
BUT I FEEL HOPELESS.

24:41.517 --> 24:46.827
WHEN I GO INTO THESE TIMES I CAN
TRY MY HARDEST AND I FEEL

24:46.862 --> 24:48.103
LITERALLY HOPELESS.

24:48.137 --> 24:51.413
RIGHT NOW ME BEING A BIG GUY,
THESE PHYSICAL COMPETITIONS ARE

24:51.448 --> 24:52.655
NOT FOR ME.

24:52.689 --> 24:56.241
IT FEELS LIKE I AM THE FAT KID
IN GYM CLASS AND EVERYONE ELSE

24:56.275 --> 24:57.517
IS RUNNING LAPS AROUND ME.

24:57.551 --> 25:02.758
I KNOW MY DAD IS SAYING PLENTY
OF BOXING MATCHES HE GOT KNOCKED

25:02.793 --> 25:06.068
DOWN CONSTANTLY BUT STILL GOT UP
AND KEPT ON SWINGING AND I AM

25:06.103 --> 25:08.862
TRYING MY BEST TO BE THAT
FRAZIER AND KEEP ON SWINGING BUT

25:08.896 --> 25:10.379
IT IS JUST HARD.

25:10.413 --> 25:14.000
I KNOW YOU ARE HELPING ME AND
I LOVE YOU AND APPRECIATE YOU

25:14.034 --> 25:15.275
FOR THAT.

25:15.310 --> 25:20.655
RIGHT NOW I AM JUST SO UPSET AND
I AM SO OVER JUST FEELING LIKE

25:20.689 --> 25:26.137
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.

25:26.172 --> 25:37.068
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT
HOH?

25:37.103 --> 25:41.517
ORIGINAL THINK PLAN WAS TO
TARGET CLAIRE THIS WEEK, SO NOW

25:41.551 --> 25:45.448
WITH TIFFANY BEING THE HOH
OBVIOUSLY CLAIRE CAN'T BE THE

25:45.482 --> 25:46.724
TARGET.

25:46.758 --> 25:49.413
THE FACT THAT OUR PLAN HAS HAD
TO CHANGE, THIS ISN'T THE WORST

25:49.448 --> 25:50.689
THING FOR MY GAME.

25:50.724 --> 25:54.206
I MEAN, LET THERE BE TENSION AND
LET THEM TAKE ON EACH OTHER SO

25:54.241 --> 25:55.482
THAT NO ONE IS LOOKING AT ME.

25:55.517 --> 26:00.310
UP TO NOW I HAVE BEEN PLAYING
THIS GAME FOR THE COOKOUT BUT AT

26:00.344 --> 26:02.862
THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS AN
INDIVIDUAL GAME.

26:19.275 --> 26:19.724
I AM NOT HERE.

26:19.758 --> 26:21.413
I AM ON VACATION.

26:21.448 --> 26:22.758
WHAT IS UP?

26:22.793 --> 26:29.241
HE SAYS -- THIS IS GOING TO
BE A TRICKY WEEK BECAUSE NOW

26:29.275 --> 26:32.241
TIFFANY HAS -- THAT DOES PISS ME
OFF.

26:32.275 --> 26:39.724
NOT MAD, JUST FEEL -- LIKE IF
EVERYONE IS GOING TO PLAY THEIR

26:39.758 --> 26:51.689
SELF-INTEREST -- WHY AM I
CONTINUING IN THIS COMPETITION?

26:51.724 --> 26:55.655
SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME -- PUT
THEMSELVES FIRST, JUMP AT IT.

26:55.689 --> 27:00.689
I DIDN'T LET MYSELF --
YOU ARE GOOD.

27:00.724 --> 27:02.482
CONSTANTLY IN THIS GAME I

27:02.517 --> 27:07.827
HAVE HAD TO PUT MY PERSONAL GAME
ASIDE FOR WHAT IS BEST FOR THE

27:07.862 --> 27:11.758
COOKOUT, AND I FEEL THAT SOME
OTHER PEOPLE IN MY ALLIANCE

27:11.793 --> 27:13.068
STRUGGLE TO DO THAT.

27:13.103 --> 27:19.758
I REALLY DON'T WANT ANY FISSURES
TO HAPPEN IN OUR LIFE, BUT I AM

27:19.793 --> 27:24.965
DESPERATE AND FRUSTRATED BUT ALL
I CAN DO IS TRUST THE PROCESS

27:25.000 --> 27:29.448
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

27:29.482 --> 27:35.172
I COULD SEE THE BLOCK FOR THE
THIRD WEEK IN A ROW.

27:35.206 --> 27:35.758
YEAH.

27:35.793 --> 27:37.448
IT DOES INFURIATE ME.

27:37.482 --> 27:39.206
BOTH TIFFANY AND KYLE THE
SHOWS WHEN IT COMES DO WINNING

27:39.241 --> 27:47.172
COMPETITION THEY WILL PUT THEIR
OWN SELF INTEREST AHEAD OF THAT

27:47.206 --> 27:48.862
OF THE COOKOUT.

27:48.896 --> 27:53.344
AND I WILL SAY SCREW IT BECAUSE
THIS IS A FAMILY SHOW.

27:53.379 --> 28:08.862
OKAY.

28:08.896 --> 28:11.034
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

28:11.068 --> 28:15.206
OKAY.

28:15.241 --> 28:29.000
FOR ME IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
50-50 BETWEEN CLAIRE AND ALYSSA.

28:29.034 --> 28:34.068
IT IS JUST THAT PEOPLE ARE
PUTTING THEIR OWN SELF-INTERESTS

28:34.103 --> 28:34.551
AHEAD OF THE COOKOUT.

28:34.586 --> 28:35.827
I UNDERSTAND.

28:35.862 --> 28:36.551
IT IS FRUSTRATING.

28:36.586 --> 28:43.172
AND I APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

28:43.206 --> 28:46.241
EVERYTHING WILL GO ACCORDING
TO PLAN.

28:46.275 --> 28:50.551
I KNOW YOU ARE ANNOYED,
XAVIER, HOH FOR THE SECOND WEEK

28:50.586 --> 28:55.034
IN THE ROW AND YOU ARE ABOUT TO
LOSE ALYSSA, HOWEVER I AM HOH.

28:55.068 --> 29:00.275
I AM REALLY NOT THAT STORY.

29:00.310 --> 29:05.896
I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU ON
THE BLOCK, BUT IF YOU TWIN POWER

29:05.931 --> 29:12.551
OF VETO WE WILL HAVE TO USE IT
ON HER.

29:12.586 --> 29:19.689
THAT MEANS YOU WILL HAVE TO
WIN IT.

29:19.724 --> 29:22.517
--
I HAVE BEEN KIND.

29:22.551 --> 29:25.793
I HAVE TAKEN ANY OF MY
COMPETITIVE SPIRIT AND KIND OF

29:25.827 --> 29:30.551
PUT IT IN THE CAGE FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE COOKOUT, BUT IF I

29:30.586 --> 29:33.793
WIN THE VETO AND USE IT ON
ALYSSA, THEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING

29:33.827 --> 29:35.068
TO DO, TIFFANY?

29:35.103 --> 29:39.034
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE WON HOH AND
NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN ME REASON TO

29:39.068 --> 29:42.551
RUIN YOUR GAME.

29:42.586 --> 29:59.172
WHO WANTS TO SEE MY HOH?

29:59.206 --> 30:01.034
YAY!

30:01.068 --> 30:03.172
ARE YOU ALREADY UP HERE?

30:03.206 --> 30:05.034
DO, DO, DO.

30:05.068 --> 30:06.965
TIFFANY WON HOH BACK-TO-BACK.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.344
I CAN'T WAIT.

30:09.379 --> 30:10.620

30:10.655 --> 30:14.482
TO BE HONEST I COULD GIVE TWO-I
DON'T WANT TO SEE NO MORE

30:14.517 --> 30:17.068
PICTURES AND I DAMNED SURE DON'T
CARE WHAT MUSIC SHE GOT THIS

30:17.103 --> 30:18.413
WEEK BECAUSE IT IS NOT BEYONCE.

30:18.448 --> 30:21.482
SHE WAS SELFISH AND DIDN'T THINK
ABOUT THE COOKOUT AND TOOK THAT

30:21.517 --> 30:22.931
WIN FOR HERSELF.

30:22.965 --> 30:24.724
SO I AM GOING TO DO WHAT I DO
BEST.

30:24.758 --> 30:29.034
I AM GOING TO SMILE WITH THESE
PRETTY WHITE TEETH, LAUGH AND

30:29.068 --> 30:33.517
ACT LIKE I CARE WHEN I REALLY
DON'T GIVE A DAMN.

30:33.551 --> 30:34.758
HA, HA, HA.

30:34.793 --> 30:35.172
YAY!

30:41.275 --> 30:51.931
THAT IS AMAZING!

30:51.965 --> 30:54.103
OH, MY GOSH.

30:54.137 --> 30:58.793
I AM HAPPY FOR TIFFANY YOU
KNOW, TO GET THE HOH AND GET ALL

30:58.827 --> 31:01.724
THE PERKS THAT COME WITH IT BUT
AT THE SAME TIME, COME ON, IF

31:01.758 --> 31:05.034
THE, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE --
MOMENT.

31:05.068 --> 31:06.275
I DON'T KNOW.

31:06.310 --> 31:09.034
I CAN'T HELP BUT YOU KNOW, FEEL
SOME TYPE OF WEIGHT FOR THE

31:09.068 --> 31:13.517
PEOPLE WHO NEVER EXPERIENCED IT.

31:13.551 --> 31:19.172
I AM ALREADY --
OKAY, OKAY.

31:19.206 --> 31:21.862
BYE, BIG D.

31:21.896 --> 31:23.172
BYE.

31:23.206 --> 31:26.620
THANK YOU.

31:26.655 --> 31:30.206
I PLAYED THIS GAME
UNSELFISHLY FOR EIGHT WEEKS.

31:30.241 --> 31:34.862
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TOO, AND I
GET IT, SO.

31:34.896 --> 31:39.137
FOR ME IT WAS EVERYTHING WE
JUST WENT UP THERE AND DID IT

31:39.172 --> 31:41.517
SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS OR AZ'S.

31:41.551 --> 31:43.965
BIG D, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

31:44.000 --> 31:44.586
HUH-UH.

31:44.620 --> 31:45.896
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING?

31:45.931 --> 31:50.931
I AM WORRIED ABOUT HER TRYING
TO PULL A FAST ONE BECAUSE TIFF

31:50.965 --> 31:54.517
-- SHE WILL TAKE THAT SHOT AT US
AND TAKE US OUT AND THAT IS WHAT

31:54.551 --> 31:59.103
IS MAKING ME SO FRUSTRATED.

31:59.137 --> 32:03.137
OH, THIS WEEK FULLY IS
BRINGING OUT MY SAVAGE SIDE.

32:03.172 --> 32:04.482
I AM NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

32:04.517 --> 32:09.620
IT WOULD BE NICE TO SAY HOH,
MIGHT GO ON THE BLOCK.

32:09.655 --> 32:11.620
BIG D WAS LIKE I KNOW HOW THIS
GOES.

32:48.379 --> 32:49.655
CAN I TRY ON THE DRESS?

32:49.689 --> 32:50.275
YES.

32:50.310 --> 32:55.034
GO AHEAD.

32:55.068 --> 33:03.517
SO TIGHT.

33:03.551 --> 33:04.620
OH.

33:04.655 --> 33:05.275
I RIPPED IT.

33:05.310 --> 33:07.068
IT IS VERY TIGHT.

33:07.103 --> 33:15.137
OKAY.

33:15.172 --> 33:19.034
IT IS VERY TIGHT.

33:23.172 --> 33:29.965
IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT?

33:30.000 --> 33:30.758
NO.

33:30.793 --> 33:31.931
YOU HAVE GOT SOME WAY TO GO,
GIRL.

33:31.965 --> 33:37.034
I HAVE WORN IT WITH --
TRY THE PURPLE AND SEE WHAT

33:37.068 --> 33:37.655
YOU THINK.

33:37.689 --> 33:43.034
YOU LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE.

33:43.068 --> 33:59.896
HEY, I AM WITH THE COOKOUT

34:11.379 --> 34:16.689
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I AM
PLAYING THIS GAME FOR ME.

34:16.724 --> 34:19.034
FOR TIFFANY, FOR TIP I TOES.

34:19.068 --> 34:22.517
NO ONE ELSE CAN BE ON THAT CHAIR
BUT ME.

34:22.551 --> 34:26.620
I WANT CLAIRE TO HAVE IN MIND
THAT IF SHE SHOULD WIN NEXT WEEK

34:26.655 --> 34:28.655
I NEED HER TO GO AFTER THE GUYS.

34:28.689 --> 34:34.965
I AM HOPING IF CLAIRE DOES WIN
HOH, SHE CAN DO WHAT IS BEST FOR

34:35.000 --> 34:42.482
TIFFANY BECAUSE THAT'S MY GIRL.

34:42.517 --> 34:52.517
HOW ARE YOU SNEELG.

35:39.724 --> 35:47.103
I AM FEELING BITTERSWEET,
REALLY, BECAUSE I WANTED TO WIN

35:47.137 --> 35:54.310
BUT I DON'T LIKE THE POSITION,
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS.

35:54.344 --> 35:57.344
I AM -- WITH MY ACTIONS RIGHT
NOW, I DO WANT TO BE

35:57.379 --> 36:03.103
STRAIGHTFORWARD WITH YOU AND
KNOW I AM CONSIDERING YOU AND X.

36:03.137 --> 36:07.241
AT THIS POINT, IT IS JUST A
GAME.

36:07.275 --> 36:09.620
I UNDERSTAND.

36:09.655 --> 36:12.862
I DO HAVE A FEW -- IF YOU DON'T
MIND.

36:12.896 --> 36:13.448
SURE.

36:13.482 --> 36:14.758
I AM ALL FOR THE PITCH.

36:14.793 --> 36:19.965
I KNOW TIFFANY PROBABLY WANTS
TO TAKE A SHOT AT ME AND XAVIER

36:20.000 --> 36:23.379
BECAUSE WE ARE A STRONG DUO, SHE
HAS A LOT OF FRIENDS AND ALL OF

36:23.413 --> 36:27.344
THE FRIENDS THAT WOULD VOTE FOR
ME IN THE END ARE ALL PREJURY,

36:27.379 --> 36:32.827
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR TIFFANY'S
0 GAME TO GO AFTER LITTLE OLD

36:32.862 --> 36:34.103
ALYSSA.

36:34.137 --> 36:40.965
WHEN YOU LOOK AT JURY VOTES,
IF YOU SIT NEXT TO ANYONE YOU

36:41.000 --> 36:44.344
HAVE -- SO LET'S JUST SAY YOU
ARE GUARANTEED THOSE THREE

36:44.379 --> 36:45.482
VOTES.

36:45.517 --> 36:50.275
IF YOU SIT NEXT TO AZAH SHE HAS
GUARANTEED TWO VOTES.

36:50.310 --> 36:55.620
IF YOU SIT NEXT TO BIG D HE HAS
A GUARANTEED TWO VOTES.

36:55.655 --> 36:58.896
AND KY HAS BEEN SAYING HE WOULD
VOTE FOR BIG D.

36:58.931 --> 37:01.103
NOW IT IS JUST WE THREE.

37:01.137 --> 37:10.896
IF YOU SIT NEXT TO KYLAND HE HAS
GUARANTEED -- YOU SIT NEXT TO

37:10.931 --> 37:14.758
CLAIRE OR HANNAH, YOU ARE NOW
TAKING AWAY ONE OF THOSE THREE

37:14.793 --> 37:18.586
VOTES THAT YOU HAD GUARANTEED IF
YOU SIT NEXT TO ANYONE ELSE BUT

37:18.620 --> 37:22.620
HANNAH AND -- BECAUSE IF YOU
THINK ABOUT IT, HANNAH, CLAIRE

37:22.655 --> 37:26.517
AND D ARE IN THE JURY, YOU SIT
NEXT TO HANNAH AND CLAIRE YOU

37:26.551 --> 37:28.793
POSSIBLY HAVE ONLY GUARANTEED
TWO VOTES.

37:28.827 --> 37:34.758
IF YOU SIT NEXT TO X, HE HAS
GUARANTEED SP'S VOTE AND MY VOTE

37:34.793 --> 37:38.862
AND WITH HIS COMPETITION SKILLS
HE COULD GET A FEW MORE VOTES.

37:38.896 --> 37:46.586
NOW YOU SIT NEXT TO LITTLE OLD
ALYSSA -- YOU HAVE GUARANTEED --

37:46.620 --> 37:53.034
VOTE, GUARANTEED CLAIRE'S VOTE,
GUARANTEED DX'S VOTE.

37:53.068 --> 37:54.896
YOU ONLY NEED FIVE VOTES TO WIN
THIS GAME.

37:54.931 --> 37:59.689
YOU ALREADY HAVE FOUR SITTING
NEXT TO ME IF ALL YOU NEED IS A

37:59.724 --> 38:03.758
FIVE THIS WEEK I WOULD SAY I
WANT TO GO AFTER KYLAND, SO I

38:03.793 --> 38:08.241
WASN'T TARGETING YOU AND I DO
BELIEVE THAT HE WAS GOING AFTER

38:08.275 --> 38:09.413
YOU.

38:09.448 --> 38:13.827
I HAD TO SAY IT, I HATE TO TO
SAY IT BUT ALYSSA'S MATH

38:13.862 --> 38:18.793
ACTUALLY ADDS UP, IF I SAT NEXT
TO ALYSSA IN THE FINAL TWO -- IS

38:18.827 --> 38:21.965
IN THE JURY I PROBABLY WOULD WIN
BY A LANDSLIDE.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.689
I DID COME HERE TO WIN AND IF
SITTING NEXT TO ALYSSA

38:28.724 --> 38:34.000
GUARANTEES ME A WIN, I DON'T
KNOW HOW TO DENY THIS OFFER.

38:51.655 --> 39:01.724
HEY, GUYS, IT IS TIME FOR THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY

39:16.931 --> 39:20.137
THIS IS THE NOMINATION CEREMONY.

39:20.172 --> 39:24.620
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

39:24.655 --> 39:27.517
TWO HOUSE GUESTS FOR EVICTION.

39:27.551 --> 39:32.379
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSE GUESTS I AM

39:32.413 --> 39:35.034
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

39:35.068 --> 39:39.482
I WILL TURN 0 TO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATIONS AND THEIR FACES

39:39.517 --> 39:41.482
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

39:41.517 --> 39:58.137
THE FIRST HOUSE GUEST I HAVE
KNOWLEDGE MADE IS -- I HAVE

39:58.172 --> 40:02.379
NOMINATED IS --
THE NEXT HOUSE GUEST I HAVE

40:02.413 --> 40:15.758
NOMINATED IS --

40:15.793 --> 40:22.034
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, ALYSSA,
AND YOU, XAVIER, THIS WAS A VERY

40:22.068 --> 40:24.862
TOUGH DECISION AS IT IS NOT
PERSONAL.

40:24.896 --> 40:30.586
IT IS PURELY A GAME MOVE AS YOU
ARE BOTH VERY STRONG

40:30.620 --> 40:31.379
COMPETITORS.

40:31.413 --> 40:34.413
THIS WAS THE BEST DECISION FOR
ME.

40:34.448 --> 40:39.862
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

40:39.896 --> 40:43.896
I NOMINATED ALYSSA AND XAVIER,
THE COOKOUT MAY HAVE WON WITH

40:43.931 --> 40:48.034
CLAIRE GONE THIS WEEK BUT THIS
IS MY HOH.

40:48.068 --> 40:52.620
I AM HERE FOR THE GRAND PRIZE
TOTAL, BABY, 750.

40:52.655 --> 40:56.310
I AM HERE FOR THAT CHECK.

40:56.344 --> 41:01.034
I WAS HOPING MAYBE PAGE WOULD DO
SOMETHING BUT CLEARLY THAT IS

41:01.068 --> 41:02.275
NOT THE CASE.

41:02.310 --> 41:05.965
I AM KIND OF OVER THE FAKENESS
AS FAR AS THIS GAME AS FAR AS

41:06.000 --> 41:08.689
BUDDYING UP WITH HOH AND THE
FAKE SMILES AND THE FAKE LAUGHS

41:08.724 --> 41:10.758
AND ALL OF THAT, I DON'T REALLY
CARE AT THIS POINT.

41:10.793 --> 41:17.896
I JUST NEED TO REALLY FOCUS AND
PLAN ON WINNING THE VETO NO

41:17.931 --> 41:19.103
FATHER WHAT HAPPENS.

41:19.137 --> 41:24.275
HERE I GO, THE THIRD WEEK IN
THE BLOCK BECAUSE TIFFANY

41:24.310 --> 41:26.206
SELFISHLY DECIDED TO WIN HOH.

41:26.241 --> 41:29.655
IF I GET THE VETO I WILL THEN
GET TO DECIDE WHETHER I WANT TO

41:29.689 --> 41:34.896
PLAY FRIENDLY OR COMPLETELY RUIN
TIFFANY'S GAME AND I COULD PULL

41:34.931 --> 41:41.206
DOWN ALYSSA INSTEAD OF MYSELF
BUT I AM SICK OF PLAYING NICE.

41:41.241 --> 41:45.172
WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE
ALYSSA OR XAVIER?

41:45.206 --> 41:46.758
PLUS, ZINGBOT IS BACK!

41:46.793 --> 41:52.862
TUNE IN WEDNESDAY NIGHT AT 8:00,
7:00 CENTRAL ON "BIG BROTHER"!
